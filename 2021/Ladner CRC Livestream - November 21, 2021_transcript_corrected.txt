[509.96 → 518.94] Good morning. Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church. You are all welcome here
[518.94 → 524.04] this morning and those that are here with us in person and also those who are joining
[524.04 → 528.86] with us on live stream. Special welcome to those who are visiting with us this morning.
[529.70 → 534.84] Unfortunately, we don't have a time of coffee after the service, but we hope we can still
[534.84 → 542.76] be able to meet you afterwards. My name is John Mantra and I will be leading this worship
[542.76 → 548.80] service this morning. A few announcements. We'd like to welcome Pastor Gary Rosema to the
[548.80 → 554.82] pulpit this morning and also welcome to Jenny, his wife, who's with him this morning. He's
[554.82 → 562.02] no stranger to a lot of us. Pastor Gary is the seafarers chaplain for Vancouver for our
[562.02 → 567.46] classes for Port of Vancouver and right here in Delta Port. And I'm sure we'll be hearing
[567.46 → 573.78] some more about his work later in the service. In fact, he's going to be showing a short video.
[573.78 → 580.78] The offering today is for the ministry to seafarers for the literature fund and I think we all know
[580.78 → 587.78] the drill how that works now. And just a reminder that this afternoon at 2.30 at the Delta View
[587.78 → 595.78] manner, there's a gathering. It's usually singing, but because of the COVID restrictions,
[596.42 → 601.34] they don't allow singing there, but we are still going to come for those that can. And there'll be
[601.34 → 606.44] music, and we can still greet the residents and there'll be some scripture reading. So for those
[606.44 → 612.22] of you that can make it, that would be great. And also a quick reminder that Pastor Jason is starting
[612.22 → 620.38] in the membership class, a series of three classes by Zoom starting this Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock.
[620.38 → 626.62] So it's not too late to sign up if you desire to become a member and learn about our church and its
[626.62 → 636.90] ministries. For the call to worship, I just have a reading here. It's a reading called,
[636.90 → 642.66] I wither away like grass. And a lot of us come here this morning with heavy hearts,
[642.66 → 648.90] a lot of connections to what's happening in the Fraser Valley for families, farm, especially farm
[648.90 → 655.30] families. And so I thought this was an appropriate reading as a call to worship. Could I ask you to
[655.30 → 670.34] rise please? With troubled hearts, we gather for worship in the midst of struggle, in pain, pain and despair.
[671.22 → 680.34] We long for God's purpose, presence. We need to know that God is with us. Today we cry out to God for
[680.34 → 689.46] healing and peace. Lord of life, all our longings are known to you. Send our roots, rain, refresh us,
[690.02 → 698.10] and make us whole. Amen. And then our greeting comes to us this morning from Revelation chapter one.
[698.98 → 706.34] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits who are
[706.34 → 714.34] before his throne and from Christ Jesus, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the
[714.34 → 722.18] kings of the earth. Now, just as God has greeted us, just turn around and greet each other. I know we're not
[722.18 → 725.38] shaking hands yet, but a wave or an elbow or whatever.
[725.38 → 726.38] So.
[731.02 → 749.94] singing
[749.94 → 770.88] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for those who mourn.
[770.88 → 778.30] You are the source of the heavens, all upon earth.
[778.30 → 786.88] Jesus, light in the darkness, Jesus, truth in your circumstance.
[788.58 → 794.74] You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[794.74 → 805.12] In history you live and die, you broke the chains, you rose to life.
[805.12 → 809.12] You are the home living in us.
[810.06 → 814.06] You are the rock in whom we trust.
[814.48 → 820.12] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[820.12 → 826.12] You rose from the dead, conquering fear.
[826.12 → 831.12] Our prince of peace, drawing us near.
[831.12 → 838.12] Jesus, our home living for all who will receive.
[838.12 → 843.12] Lord, we believe.
[843.12 → 855.12] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[855.12 → 862.12] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[862.12 → 867.12] Jesus, light in the darkness.

[872.12 → 879.12] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[879.12 → 880.12] Jesus, truth in your circumstance.
[880.12 → 881.12] Jesus, truth in your circumstance.
[881.12 → 885.12] In history you live and die.
[885.12 → 890.12] You broke the chains, you rose to life.
[890.12 → 906.12] You are the hope living in us. You are the rock in whom we trust. You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[906.12 → 925.12] You rose from the dead, conquered in fear. Our Prince of Peace drawing us near. Jesus our home living for all who will receive.
[925.12 → 937.12] Lord, we believe. Lord, we believe. Lord, we believe.
[955.12 → 972.12] We are a moment. You are forever. Lord of the ages. God before time.
[972.12 → 987.12] We are forever. You are eternal. Lord everlasting. Railing on high.
[987.12 → 1008.12] Holy, holy Lord God almighty. Holy is the Lamb who was slain. Highest praises all and glory.
[1008.12 → 1021.12] Be unto your name. Be unto your name.
[1021.12 → 1035.12] We are the hope living in us. You are the healer. Jesus, ready my, mighty to say.
[1035.12 → 1051.12] You are the love song. We will sing forever. Bowing before you. Blessed in your name.
[1051.12 → 1057.12] Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[1057.12 → 1058.12] Holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[1058.12 → 1072.12] Holy is the Lamb who was slain. Highest praises all and glory.
[1072.12 → 1078.12] Be unto your name.
[1078.12 → 1080.12] Be unto your name.
[1080.12 → 1085.12] Holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[1085.12 → 1088.12] Holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[1088.12 → 1091.12] Holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[1091.12 → 1098.12] Holy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1098.12 → 1104.12] Highest praises all and glory.
[1104.12 → 1110.12] Holy, holy, holy.
[1110.12 → 1113.12] Be unto your name.
[1113.12 → 1120.12] Be unto your name.
[1124.62 → 1133.12] You may be seated.
[1133.12 → 1141.76] taken from Psalm 51. It will be on the screen and I ask you to witness this family to that
[1141.76 → 1149.68] we all read that together. Have mercy on me O God according to your steadfast love. According
[1149.68 → 1158.16] to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly my iniquity and cleanse
[1158.16 → 1167.12] me from my sin. For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. Against you,
[1167.12 → 1175.84] you alone have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that you are justified in your
[1175.84 → 1186.56] sentence and blameless when you pass judgment. And then our assurance of pardon comes from Psalm 130.
[1186.56 → 1189.44] Again, it will be on the overhead on the screen.
[1193.52 → 1206.60] You desire truth in the inward being. Therefore, teach me wisdom in my secret heart. Hide your face from my
[1206.60 → 1215.32] sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit
[1215.32 → 1224.28] within me. Do not pass me from your presence and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
[1224.28 → 1230.28] And we'll sing about that. Sing about assurance. Christ is mine forevermore.
[1230.28 → 1232.28] I was made to walk with Him.
[1232.28 → 1236.28] I was made to walk with Him.
[1236.28 → 1246.28] I was made to walk with Him.
[1246.28 → 1256.28] Yet I looked for worldly treasured and forsake the King of kings. But mine is hope in my Redeemer.
[1256.28 → 1266.28] Though I fall, His love is sure. For Christ does bid for every feeling. I am His.
[1266.28 → 1268.28] forevermore.
[1268.28 → 1269.28] I am His.
[1269.28 → 1270.28] I am His.
[1270.28 → 1272.28] forevermore.
[1272.28 → 1276.28] mine are tears in times of sorrow.

[1375.74 → 1377.78] He will deliver

[1382.78 → 1385.16] And mine is peace
[1385.16 → 1387.86] To Zion's city
[1387.86 → 1390.10] Where beside
[1390.10 → 1392.24] The king I want
[1392.24 → 1394.58] For there my heart
[1394.58 → 1397.22] Has found its pleasure
[1397.22 → 1399.42] Christ is mine

[1472.54 → 1473.76] Adorn
[1473.76 → 1484.42] Forevermore, cross his mind forevermore, cross his mind forevermore.
[1484.42 → 1506.50] So before the kids go off to kids life, Gary's going to show, we're going to see the video
[1506.50 → 1508.06] clip from the seafarers' ministry.
[1508.62 → 1513.60] And then as soon as that clip is done, the children are welcome to leave for their classes.
[1514.42 → 1522.10] And then right after that, Lena Astra will read the scripture passage and then Gary will
[1522.10 → 1523.94] be to worship or preach.
[1531.68 → 1536.38] Yeah, just very quickly, by way of introduction, it's great to be here again.
[1537.02 → 1539.40] Jenny and I were commenting as we were driving in.
[1539.40 → 1544.82] I think the last time we were here was in the midst of one of those incredible heat waves
[1544.82 → 1545.42] in the summer.
[1545.42 → 1549.58] And we were parking way at the far end to try to find as much shade as we could.
[1549.58 → 1552.68] And we even borrowed our son's car, which has air conditioning and ours doesn't.
[1552.68 → 1555.34] And now here we are this week.
[1555.34 → 1560.52] And so it has been quite a year in so many instances.
[1560.52 → 1568.48] And it's really affected the port and the traffic in and out, which has almost come to a ground
[1568.48 → 1569.32] to a standstill.
[1569.32 → 1573.40] So it's been quite an interesting and a busy week in the port as well.
[1573.96 → 1576.22] But anyway, I put this video together.
[1577.18 → 1579.84] Jenny and I put this video together recently.
[1580.08 → 1581.46] She was my filmography.
[1582.20 → 1583.28] I'm not sure if that's a word.
[1583.28 → 1586.68] But, and so we kind of had fun with it.
[1586.80 → 1589.68] Megan Waterloo from, she was our intern before.
[1589.78 → 1591.00] She's helping us out a bit still.
[1591.62 → 1594.62] She kind of put it, edited it and put it together.
[1595.08 → 1597.60] But it's just a little bit of an introduction to what's happening.
[1597.68 → 1600.80] So I thought if the kids are here, those that can stay, they might want to see it.
[1600.88 → 1605.24] And it makes, if it's in film version, it stays shorter than if I start gabbing on and on.
[1606.06 → 1607.42] But, and enjoy.
[1607.54 → 1608.82] And we had a little bit of fun with this one.
[1608.82 → 1614.66] So at the very end, we put in a couple of bloopers and thought it would be just kind of fun to do that.
[1614.94 → 1616.54] And then Jenny gets a voice in there.
[1616.74 → 1619.00] And we even get kudos to our dog, Swift.
[1619.34 → 1620.40] So, enjoy.
[1621.14 → 1625.54] Hi, I'm Gary Rosa, the Christian Reform Chaplain here in the Port of Vancouver.
[1626.26 → 1630.76] We're here actually right now on the Southern Gulf Islands overlooking Plumper Sound.
[1630.88 → 1637.18] You can probably see a couple of ships in the back behind me that are anchored, waiting to enter the Port of Vancouver.
[1637.18 → 1645.74] We mainly visit them once they're actually in the Port and at their terminals, where we're able to go on board and actually meet with the seafarers.
[1645.84 → 1649.24] One of the things we've been doing lately is helping with vaccinations.
[1650.22 → 1658.48] We mainly advise them about the possibility and connect them with the right people so that they can get vaccinated.
[1658.48 → 1669.54] For example, recently, here are three seafarers who I brought to the centre and where the vaccinating team could come and help them.
[1669.96 → 1674.56] So this has been a great blessing, a great plus for the seafarers.
[1674.66 → 1676.28] They're really appreciative of that.
[1676.28 → 1682.54] And one of the things it's meant is that even though their access to the seafarers centres is still largely restricted,
[1682.54 → 1688.54] they're more open to us coming on board and actually coming inside the accommodations and meeting with them.
[1688.54 → 1696.42] So I've been having meals inside, which is the best time to actually connect and meet with a lot of seafarers.
[1697.02 → 1706.52] And one of the things, especially a highlight for me recently, was being able to lead a worship service with a number of Indonesian Christians on board one of the vessels.
[1706.52 → 1710.34] That's the first time I've done that since COVID broke out.
[1710.34 → 1714.06] So that was a real special time for me and I think for them as well.
[1714.50 → 1718.92] I still say prayers with many of the guys individually or with two or three,
[1719.18 → 1724.90] but to actually have singing and prayers and open the scriptures with them was a real, real blessing.
[1725.54 → 1728.24] So thanks for your support for this ministry.
[1728.94 → 1734.86] We're gearing up for Christmas at sea, of course, and we appreciate your involvement and support in that.
[1734.86 → 1740.78] And we continue to serve and appreciate your prayers for us and for the seafarers.
[1740.88 → 1742.80] So continue to keep them in your prayers as well.
[1743.04 → 1744.08] Thank you and God bless.
[1748.70 → 1750.24] Oh, no.
[1751.50 → 1753.20] Hi from the Port of Vancouver.
[1753.78 → 1757.86] I'm Gary Rosema, the Christian Reformed chaplain here in the...
[1757.86 → 1760.20] Oh, it was on my island.
[1760.42 → 1762.26] No, it wasn't. It wasn't that. It was something else.
[1762.32 → 1763.90] It was something little and harmless.
[1764.86 → 1766.16] Okay, honey, you've got to...
[1766.16 → 1767.94] I need you to help me to pull it together.
[1768.12 → 1768.70] So if you go away.
[1768.70 → 1768.76] Okay.
[1768.76 → 1769.70] So if you go away...
[1794.86 → 1809.04] Our scripture reading today is from Mark 12, verses 38 to 44.
[1809.04 → 1814.68] As he taught, Jesus said, watch out for the teachers of the law.
[1815.30 → 1820.26] They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces
[1820.26 → 1825.70] and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.
[1826.30 → 1830.40] They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.
[1831.26 → 1833.32] These men will be punished most severely.
[1833.32 → 1841.76] Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.
[1842.62 → 1845.02] Many rich people threw in large amounts.
[1845.78 → 1851.80] But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins worth only a few cents.
[1852.88 → 1855.30] Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,
[1855.30 → 1861.46] Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
[1862.20 → 1867.22] They all gave out of their wealth, but she, out of her poverty, put in everything.
[1867.94 → 1869.48] All she had to live on.
[1870.80 → 1872.38] This is the word of the Lord.
[1872.38 → 1874.20] Thank you, Lord.
[1874.20 → 1892.92] Would you bow with me in a word of prayer?
[1892.92 → 1922.90] Thank you, Lord.
[1922.92 → 1928.80] Who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever.
[1929.66 → 1930.14] Amen.
[1941.20 → 1944.82] Well, as we're opening the scripture from Mark 12.
[1945.66 → 1948.18] Anyway, again, it's great to be here.
[1948.18 → 1953.18] You have no idea how many times we had to film that to get it right.
[1953.42 → 1953.60] Okay.
[1954.06 → 1955.74] I could have shown a lot more bloopers.
[1956.82 → 1961.00] But anyway, thank you for your continued support.
[1961.26 → 1966.10] And interesting, you're having an offering for the literature fund.
[1966.10 → 1971.96] And I've actually brought back in today because they've got in touch with me.
[1972.08 → 1980.36] And I brought like 10 or 12 of these Chinese bilingual New Testaments for the service here.
[1980.54 → 1983.64] So, you know, cast your bread upon the waters, and it comes back to you many times.
[1983.76 → 1985.16] So, it kind of comes back to you too.
[1985.16 → 1990.28] But we certainly do appreciate that very much, all your support for this ministry.
[1991.48 → 1993.54] Anyway, Mark chapter 12.
[1993.54 → 1997.70] I was at the...
[1997.70 → 1999.70] I've been boarding ships, of course.
[1999.96 → 2007.54] As mentioned, most of the seafarers cannot still come off the ships and come to the centre.
[2007.74 → 2011.30] That's changing a little bit, but it's very, very slow.
[2011.30 → 2015.18] And we're actually starting to make a case, press cases.
[2015.32 → 2022.74] Because technically, the MLC, the Maritime Labour Convention, does not allow them to restrict seafarers.
[2022.98 → 2024.42] And so, we're starting to...
[2024.42 → 2026.32] And more and more have been.
[2026.40 → 2027.60] They're being vaccinated here.
[2027.68 → 2029.02] They've been vaccinated other places.
[2029.18 → 2031.16] So, we're starting to really push that.
[2031.70 → 2034.22] But it still remains that many of them can't.
[2034.24 → 2035.44] So, I often board the ships.
[2035.44 → 2043.40] And when I go on, say, for example, at the terminal that's right by the downtown centre there at the foot of Main Street.
[2043.84 → 2045.50] Century or Centennial Terminal.
[2046.16 → 2049.84] And I'll get a ride in with the security guard.
[2049.94 → 2050.58] Go on the ship.
[2050.80 → 2054.30] And I say to the guys on board the ship.
[2055.12 → 2059.32] Well, you know, the seafarer centre, it's just...
[2059.32 → 2061.80] And there's a big, tall, blue maintenance building.
[2062.04 → 2063.86] And I point to it and say, you see that building?
[2064.00 → 2064.26] Yeah.
[2064.26 → 2066.62] The seafarer centre is right beside it.
[2067.20 → 2069.66] And they always go, oh, wow, so close.
[2070.60 → 2071.96] But it doesn't matter.
[2073.12 → 2075.96] So close, but still so far.
[2077.64 → 2082.82] And that reality for them is sort of like...
[2082.82 → 2084.32] And I was comparing that to here.
[2084.80 → 2086.58] Sometimes you can be so close.
[2087.18 → 2088.16] So close.
[2088.86 → 2090.32] And still so far.
[2090.32 → 2094.72] And so we're looking today at two...
[2094.72 → 2098.26] Sort of two stories, but they're tied together here.
[2098.26 → 2102.82] It's the story of the scribes in Jesus' time.
[2102.92 → 2108.04] And Jesus' real condemnation or rebuke of the scribes.
[2108.04 → 2118.72] And then, by contrast, that this poor widow who is acknowledged, even praised for her self-sacrificial giving.
[2119.60 → 2120.52] So let's look at this.
[2120.90 → 2122.60] First, who were the scribes, anyway?
[2122.60 → 2130.20] And I was interested to just explore that a little bit more and look into what their role was.
[2130.20 → 2131.44] The scribes...
[2131.44 → 2134.54] A scribe, literally, is someone who just can write.
[2134.54 → 2142.04] And in a largely preliterate society, not many people could write.
[2142.88 → 2146.46] And so the role of the scribe was a hugely important one.
[2147.30 → 2150.68] They were the recorders for governments.
[2151.82 → 2157.60] And in all kinds of ways, they were the ones who could read and write when most people could not.
[2157.60 → 2167.56] And so the scribal tradition in the Israelite story really starts with that.
[2167.56 → 2173.56] But then eventually, it becomes very much connected with, after the destruction of the first temple,
[2174.44 → 2181.98] with the preservation of the law and the interpretation of the law and the teaching of the law.
[2181.98 → 2182.38] Torah.
[2183.38 → 2183.82] Torah.
[2184.54 → 2185.20] I mean there.
[2185.40 → 2186.56] That's a better term to use.
[2186.76 → 2187.14] Torah.
[2187.46 → 2188.16] The instruction.
[2188.42 → 2189.20] God's teaching.
[2189.58 → 2190.54] The word of the Lord.
[2191.22 → 2192.58] And so these are the great teachers.
[2193.00 → 2197.68] And of course, the sort of preeminent early scribe was Ezra.
[2198.30 → 2206.76] He was also a high priest, but he was, at the same time, he's considered sort of the first real scribe in that tradition.
[2206.76 → 2209.72] He's the one who interpreted the law for the people.
[2209.72 → 2216.52] And that tradition gets carried on right through into the second temple period, which was when Jesus was there.
[2217.32 → 2222.42] And these are the ones who taught, who interpreted.
[2222.56 → 2229.10] They're sometimes referred to as lawyers or experts in the law or in the Torah.
[2229.78 → 2232.66] And they were hugely respected and honoured.
[2232.66 → 2241.32] They could be from the priestly group, or they could be Sadducee's, or they could be Pharisees.
[2241.40 → 2242.78] Many of them were Pharisees.
[2243.22 → 2247.98] But they were the real experts in the law.
[2248.08 → 2249.60] And they were highly regarded.
[2250.24 → 2256.12] And they later become, after the destruction of the temple, the second temple, and into the second century,
[2256.12 → 2260.80] they become what's known as the rabbinic tradition or rabbinic Judaism.
[2261.42 → 2262.58] That really is how it develops.
[2262.68 → 2264.52] And they're already being called rabbis.
[2264.92 → 2267.34] Teacher, my teacher, or master, or lord.
[2268.50 → 2270.12] So that's who these scribes are.
[2270.24 → 2273.48] They're really, they're the theologians.
[2273.64 → 2274.96] They're the teachers.
[2275.34 → 2276.36] They're the pastors.
[2276.76 → 2280.36] They're the ones who people look up to, largely.
[2280.36 → 2285.88] And yet, Jesus attacks them.
[2286.20 → 2290.82] And he's often at odds with those same scribes.
[2293.02 → 2297.48] In this chapter, if you go back and look at it later, maybe you want to read through it,
[2297.68 → 2300.68] he's already addressed now the Pharisees.
[2301.08 → 2303.32] And he's addressed the Sadducee's.
[2303.44 → 2304.68] They have questions for him.
[2304.70 → 2306.30] And he answers them.
[2306.30 → 2310.68] And then he comes to the scribes.
[2310.84 → 2312.06] Now, it's interesting.
[2312.44 → 2317.90] Not all the scribes are seen as wholly bad.
[2318.88 → 2323.34] Just a bit earlier in this chapter, beginning at verse 28,
[2323.74 → 2326.42] Jesus has this encounter with one of the scribes,
[2326.50 → 2331.34] who comes up to him after he's answered the Pharisees and the Sadducee's.
[2331.42 → 2331.86] And he says,
[2332.24 → 2335.20] Wow, you've answered well, good teacher.
[2336.30 → 2337.80] You've answered really well.
[2338.12 → 2340.70] And tell us now, what's the greatest commandment?
[2340.78 → 2344.26] And that's when Jesus gives this whole, you know, the first commandment,
[2344.36 → 2347.08] You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, mind and strength.
[2347.22 → 2350.62] And the second one is, you shall love your neighbour as yourself.
[2351.08 → 2353.44] And the scribe says to Jesus,
[2354.16 → 2355.26] You've answered well.
[2357.32 → 2358.18] That is true.
[2358.24 → 2361.02] And he goes on to just sort of reiterate what Jesus has said.
[2361.10 → 2362.34] That really is true.
[2362.52 → 2365.04] We love God and love your neighbour.
[2365.04 → 2367.48] And interestingly, Jesus says to him,
[2367.70 → 2372.24] You are not far from the kingdom of God.
[2372.90 → 2374.48] You are not far.
[2374.66 → 2375.68] You're so close.
[2376.32 → 2377.20] So close.
[2380.78 → 2384.62] So they're not all bad, necessarily.
[2384.62 → 2396.26] But what's really happening here is that there's this, we would call it today, I think, a systemic problem or a systemic issue.
[2396.44 → 2397.18] We're hearing a lot.
[2397.26 → 2412.32] We've been hearing a lot lately in the last couple of years, especially about systemic racism or, you know, these kinds of problems where it kind of, it's not that everyone is necessarily racist, but it's sort of in the system.
[2412.32 → 2415.00] And I think that's really what Jesus is saying here, more or less.
[2415.00 → 2427.32] There's just a deep-rooted problem in the whole system, in the whole scribal tradition that needs to be addressed.
[2427.32 → 2432.94] And their basic problem, he says, in verses 38 to 40.
[2433.90 → 2442.60] He talks about how, essentially, remember he's just said the two greatest commandments, love the Lord and love your neighbour as yourself.
[2442.60 → 2454.96] And now he says, instead of being Body-centred, these scribes tend to be ego-entered, re-entered.
[2455.68 → 2460.76] They love the honour and the praise, and they love to be the centre of attention.
[2460.96 → 2463.12] They love that respect that they receive.
[2463.12 → 2471.06] They're much more intent on honouring self rather than really honouring God, he says.
[2471.56 → 2478.24] And then secondly, they're devouring widows' houses, he says.
[2480.26 → 2487.90] Now, it's not exactly clear what he meant by that, what kind of devouring of widows' houses is going on.
[2487.90 → 2495.62] But in some way, they're exploiting or taking advantage of the poor, the people who the Old Testament always is saying,
[2495.76 → 2501.90] look after the widows and the orphans, the sojourners, the marginalized people.
[2501.98 → 2503.48] Those are the ones you really need to take care of.
[2503.56 → 2505.36] But they're taking advantage of them.
[2505.78 → 2511.94] In essence, they're contravening the second commandment, love your neighbour as yourself.
[2511.94 → 2523.18] And so this whole problem for them is they're not doing what they know is the central part of the law, of the Torah, of God's teaching.
[2528.12 → 2531.00] Isaiah chapter 1.
[2531.88 → 2539.86] We could go to so many texts, but if you could put up the Isaiah 1 text starting at verse 12.
[2539.86 → 2546.06] And this, again, sort of, and it's interesting because Jesus is saying this, remember.
[2546.74 → 2559.00] He's addressing them in the temple, in the central place of worship, of religious ritual that's going on and of sacrifice.
[2559.22 → 2560.52] That's where he's addressing them.
[2561.12 → 2568.86] And then he, and then that, think about this kind of, and then he really rebukes them for their sin.
[2568.86 → 2571.18] And hear these words from Isaiah the prophet.
[2572.12 → 2573.42] Well, God speaking through him.
[2573.64 → 2581.72] When you come to appear before me in the temple, that kind of thing, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?
[2582.24 → 2584.74] Stop bringing meaningless offerings.
[2585.24 → 2587.10] Your incense is detestable to me.
[2587.40 → 2589.62] New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations.
[2589.76 → 2592.54] I cannot bear your worthless assemblies.
[2592.54 → 2598.34] Your new moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being.
[2598.84 → 2600.82] They have become a burden to me.
[2601.24 → 2603.18] I am weary of bearing them.
[2603.54 → 2608.44] When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you.
[2608.96 → 2612.56] Even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening.
[2612.72 → 2614.54] Your hands are full of blood.
[2614.54 → 2618.08] God, wash and make yourselves clean.
[2618.90 → 2621.24] Take your evil deeds out of my sight.
[2621.42 → 2622.60] Stop doing wrong.
[2623.12 → 2624.12] Learn to do right.
[2624.42 → 2625.32] Seek justice.
[2626.06 → 2627.20] Defend the oppressed.
[2628.50 → 2630.74] Take up the cause of the fatherless.
[2631.52 → 2633.84] Plead the case of the widow.
[2633.84 → 2639.72] And that kind of call is repeated.
[2639.86 → 2642.66] And they knew this all through the Old Testament.
[2643.08 → 2645.48] And Jesus says, but you're not doing it.
[2646.24 → 2652.44] You're not living what you're trying to expound, teach, and preserve.
[2655.14 → 2658.26] You're not looking after the widows.
[2659.40 → 2661.72] And then, who shows up?
[2661.72 → 2663.96] A widow.
[2665.64 → 2666.44] Interesting, isn't it?
[2666.46 → 2668.36] And that's probably what connects these two texts.
[2668.92 → 2670.14] He's still in the temple.
[2670.76 → 2673.88] He's watching people come in, put in their offerings.
[2674.10 → 2679.26] And apparently, they had these offering kind of vessels all over.
[2679.38 → 2681.44] There were like, I think, 13 of them around the temple.
[2681.68 → 2683.58] And people would clunk in their money.
[2683.78 → 2685.56] And they would make kind of a show of it.
[2685.60 → 2687.22] You could see how much they were giving.
[2687.74 → 2689.50] And so, he's in there.
[2689.50 → 2693.16] And then comes this widow.
[2694.96 → 2695.60] Interestingly.
[2696.76 → 2701.26] Now, recent scholarship, much recent scholarship, I'm talking about in the last, especially,
[2701.66 → 2708.34] 40 years or so, has really begun to really highlight this connection with the widow,
[2708.34 → 2710.22] devouring widows' houses.
[2710.22 → 2719.46] And now, here comes a widow putting her, all she has, into that temple treasury, into that offering box.
[2719.46 → 2733.08] And the question is, is this actually also, or more of, maybe, some would say, a case of, actually, she's being taken advantage of.
[2733.08 → 2739.44] She's the one who's being devoured, in a sense, all her possessions.
[2739.44 → 2744.78] She's the one who's getting the raw deal in this.
[2745.32 → 2753.10] Well, the, the, and, and, the, the temple, that second temple, it was an incredibly elaborate structure.
[2753.22 → 2754.24] It was beautiful.
[2754.56 → 2756.00] It was ostentatious.
[2756.00 → 2757.00] It was beautiful.
[2757.00 → 2758.00] It was beautiful.
[2758.00 → 2761.00] And here, she comes in and puts everything she has just to support it.
[2761.30 → 2767.64] And, and, you might think of, uh, when I was reading through that, I was reminded of, uh, we hear about these stories, right?
[2767.68 → 2782.10] About, whatever, media preachers, the, the, some of these big names who beg on TV or whatever, through whatever means for money because we're desperate to do ministry.
[2782.10 → 2787.94] And then later, we find out they have multiple homes all over the place.
[2787.94 → 2792.16] And they're taking in, you know, millions and millions of dollars.
[2792.32 → 2797.54] And people scratch their heads going, oh, there's something wrong with this system, right?
[2798.34 → 2799.96] This isn't right.
[2800.60 → 2802.74] While other people are sacrificing hugely.
[2803.24 → 2805.82] And, and that's probably partly what's going on here.
[2806.84 → 2810.02] This almost condemnation of what's going on.
[2810.02 → 2816.46] And I think it's especially true because, one, that connection with the devouring widows' houses and then the widow shows up.
[2816.62 → 2821.30] But also, the very next chapter, chapter 13, he leaves the temple.
[2821.68 → 2827.46] And then Jesus is going to pronounce that coming judgment on the temple.
[2827.70 → 2829.58] The little apocalypse of Mark 13.
[2829.58 → 2840.10] And so, I think tying that in, it's, it's fairly clear that he's saying some harsh things about the whole system and what's happening there.
[2840.10 → 2843.10] It's interesting.
[2843.82 → 2845.84] Jesus isn't unique in this.
[2845.94 → 2850.26] There are other writings, others who saw this same kind of abuse.
[2850.78 → 2864.14] There's a later rabbinic writing on, it's actually a commentary on the book of Leviticus from, we don't know, at least the 5th century, or it could be a bit earlier when that comes from.
[2864.14 → 2873.82] But in that, they tell the story of a priest who, when a woman comes and brings a little bit of flour to put it in the offering box.
[2873.88 → 2875.82] That's all she had, a handful of flour.
[2876.14 → 2879.92] And he rebukes her and says, oh, what's that nonsense?
[2880.12 → 2880.78] Get out of here.
[2880.78 → 2885.72] And later that night, in a dream, a voice comes to her.
[2885.80 → 2891.70] The Lord speaks to him, to the priest, and says, quote, do not despise her.
[2892.22 → 2897.46] It is regarded as if she had sacrificed her own life.
[2899.12 → 2899.98] Close quote.
[2901.46 → 2904.34] And so, others recognize this issue.
[2904.34 → 2913.32] It's not that Jesus is unique in that, but he does really call these scribes out very publicly in that regard.
[2915.40 → 2931.26] At the same time, traditionally, this text, of course, has always been understood and described, explained, as commending this widow, this poor widow,
[2931.26 → 2936.72] for all she's doing, for her incredible sacrifice to the Lord.
[2937.78 → 2941.98] And so, there's sort of this debate among scholars today.
[2942.32 → 2948.18] Is he rebuking the scribes through this and the whole system, or is he commending the widow?
[2948.58 → 2950.20] And honestly, I think it's both.
[2950.20 → 2964.64] At the same time that she is, or that he's, she's doing this sacrificial giving, she's also, in a sense, giving to a den of thieves, as the temple was sometimes referred to.
[2965.32 → 2968.12] And there's a sad side to this whole thing.
[2968.24 → 2976.88] But yet, yet, it can't be doubted that she is being commended for what she is doing and all that she is giving.
[2976.88 → 2978.34] She gave all.
[2978.54 → 2981.42] And there's these stark contrasts in this text.
[2982.38 → 2988.46] It comes out clearly if you look at verse 41, at the end of verse 41.
[2988.90 → 2991.36] And the Greek literally says this,
[2992.66 → 2997.84] Many rich people threw in much.
[2999.24 → 3003.18] Many rich people threw in much.
[3003.18 → 3017.98] And then in verse 42, it says, but, and the Greek is very explicit, but one poor widow threw in two pennies.
[3018.50 → 3023.20] Or, it's, it was the, the coin that was the smallest coin in circulation.
[3023.38 → 3025.18] It wasn't even in circulation in all areas.
[3025.82 → 3027.02] So, he has to explain it.
[3027.08 → 3029.80] It's actually this mount, because a lot of people didn't even know what it was anymore.
[3029.80 → 3031.30] It was so small.
[3032.54 → 3034.74] Like, we don't even use pennies anymore, right?
[3034.84 → 3035.66] So, it works.
[3036.22 → 3040.40] It's like two pennies she throws in.
[3040.62 → 3046.42] It's nothing in our eyes, the way we would look at it.
[3047.80 → 3051.10] And, and, and the point is, she gave everything.
[3051.28 → 3054.38] She gave two, two lepta are the Greek word.
[3054.50 → 3056.28] Two of these tiny little coins.
[3056.28 → 3061.56] And the point, of course, is, she could have legitimately kept one for herself, but she didn't.
[3061.62 → 3062.30] She threw both in.
[3064.62 → 3066.14] She gave everything.
[3068.50 → 3073.90] And in God's economy, she gave more.
[3074.02 → 3074.92] And it's very explicit.
[3075.24 → 3077.46] She gave more, not just than each of the others.
[3077.74 → 3079.86] She gave more than all of them combined.
[3079.86 → 3085.16] Than everyone else combined.
[3088.28 → 3093.98] This is that season in the seafarers' ministry of Christmas at Sea, as you know.
[3094.42 → 3102.54] And we appreciate the gifts coming in and the for the donations for Christmas at Sea.
[3102.64 → 3103.72] We're getting ready for that.
[3103.72 → 3107.32] We're going to be packing those in that second weekend in December.
[3107.32 → 3108.98] And then start distributing gifts.
[3109.58 → 3110.92] It's an exciting time.
[3110.98 → 3115.00] But I get a lot of checks coming in to the office at this time.
[3115.32 → 3120.88] And I write thank yous to the people or email or send out a letter or whatever.
[3121.66 → 3124.50] And you get checks for various amounts.
[3124.68 → 3129.50] You know, $25, $50, or $100, or sometimes $300, or $500.
[3129.50 → 3129.90] Wow.
[3130.14 → 3132.98] And then every once in a while you get a check for $10.
[3134.32 → 3134.68] $5.
[3134.86 → 3138.64] And I always remember this story when I get that.
[3138.70 → 3140.18] Because it's really tempting to think, $10.
[3142.10 → 3146.50] I've got to spend $1.30 probably on the stamp and the envelope and everything else.
[3146.92 → 3148.50] Is it worth it or not?
[3148.56 → 3149.60] You know, to send out a thank-you.
[3149.72 → 3150.52] But you know what?
[3150.90 → 3151.60] Who knows?
[3152.60 → 3156.10] Who knows what that sacrifice that meant?
[3157.00 → 3159.32] How does God look at that gift?
[3159.50 → 3161.66] I don't know.
[3162.02 → 3163.42] I don't know the circumstances.
[3163.72 → 3164.58] He does.
[3165.78 → 3172.70] I preached this sermon, actually, two weeks ago at the Anglican Church, Little Anglican Church on Main Island.
[3173.04 → 3175.02] That was how I was assigned this text.
[3176.10 → 3181.10] And after the sermon, after the service, one of the parishioners said,
[3181.38 → 3184.12] Hey, I've got to show you something in the back here of this church.
[3184.20 → 3186.52] This is an old, old church on Main Island.
[3186.52 → 3188.50] And so we went to the back.
[3188.56 → 3191.12] He said that in the entryway, I'd never seen it before.
[3191.16 → 3192.64] I'd never really noticed it before.
[3193.00 → 3199.16] There's a plaque board with, and it has little rings, things hung on it.
[3199.20 → 3200.74] And it has little amounts on it all.
[3200.74 → 3206.04] And what it is, is in 1903, I can't believe they still kept this thing.
[3207.40 → 3215.72] 1903, they raised funds for the church, for something adding, I don't know, land or some building.
[3215.94 → 3220.14] I think it was something to do with the land, to raise money, to buy the land.
[3220.14 → 3229.28] And they have the names of each family member, that each person gave, and how much they gave.
[3230.64 → 3232.14] I know we'd never do that today, right?
[3232.20 → 3234.30] I was like, oh, wow, I can't believe this is happening.
[3234.66 → 3243.66] And he says, look it, at the top, at the top is so-and-so, and they gave, and it was some bizarre number, $540.43 or something like that.
[3243.66 → 3250.78] And then there was one for like a couple of hundred, and then there's a lot of 25s and 10s, and then there's a bunch of $1.
[3251.38 → 3257.34] And right in the middle was this one that says 25 cents.
[3258.90 → 3263.52] And the guy said, I've always wondered, who was this guy who gave 25 cents?
[3264.06 → 3271.88] And was it, was he just a tight-fisted, I was going to say Dutchman, but he wasn't, he's an Anglican.
[3271.88 → 3278.08] Was he just tight-fisted, or was this really a huge sacrifice for this person?
[3278.94 → 3280.12] Again, we don't know.
[3282.76 → 3289.84] Here in this case, Jesus tells us, this was a huge, huge sacrifice for her.
[3291.00 → 3292.54] She gave everything.
[3292.54 → 3304.06] And so she's commended for her sacrifice and for her total trust in God.
[3304.06 → 3310.96] It makes it clear, the text again, if you look at it carefully right at the end there.
[3311.40 → 3319.20] She, out of her poverty, and the text says, gave all that she had.
[3319.98 → 3321.50] That's what the Greek literally says.
[3321.86 → 3324.14] All that she had.
[3324.14 → 3328.58] Now there's an interesting parallel there, because you remember back in Mark chapter 10,
[3329.12 → 3336.88] when this rich man comes to Jesus and says, what do I have to do to inherit eternal life?
[3338.22 → 3339.22] And what does Jesus do?
[3339.28 → 3340.54] He says, ah, here are the commands.
[3340.66 → 3343.76] You know, honour your father and mother, don't murder, don't commit adultery, DA-da-da-da.
[3343.84 → 3345.10] He lists a bunch of them.
[3345.38 → 3346.56] And the guy says, I've done all that.
[3347.70 → 3348.90] And then what does Jesus say?
[3348.90 → 3357.54] Go sell, and in virtually the same identical Greek, go sell all that you have.
[3358.58 → 3359.74] And give to the poor.
[3360.70 → 3361.84] And then come and follow me.
[3363.48 → 3365.48] Go sell all that you have.
[3365.80 → 3369.16] She gave all that she had.
[3370.98 → 3375.22] And then it goes on to say, all her living.
[3375.22 → 3382.20] The Greek word is the word bios, or it's sort of like B-I-O-S.
[3383.02 → 3385.42] It's where we get our word biology.
[3386.34 → 3390.02] And in classical Greek, the word just meant life.
[3390.96 → 3392.28] The science of life, right?
[3392.36 → 3392.80] Biology.
[3394.30 → 3396.66] She gave, in a sense, her life.
[3396.66 → 3408.80] Now, by the time of New Testament Greek, Koine Greek that we could call it, the word had come to mean sort of more livelihood, your sustenance, you know, what you had to live on.
[3409.46 → 3412.60] But still, there's this sense of this is life.
[3414.94 → 3418.86] And so you see that this text is about way more than money.
[3419.82 → 3421.52] It's not just about money.
[3421.52 → 3425.60] It's about giving everything.
[3427.50 → 3430.40] Sacrificing all for Jesus.
[3431.22 → 3432.56] For the kingdom of heaven.
[3434.80 → 3443.48] And the other thing that struck me as I was reading through this is, no one else saw, really, what she gave.
[3443.58 → 3444.90] No one else would have taken notice.
[3445.02 → 3446.72] If it hadn't been for Jesus, we wouldn't know.
[3447.18 → 3451.38] No one would ever know what she gave, would they?
[3451.52 → 3455.48] And she, there would be nothing remarkable about this woman.
[3456.24 → 3457.62] This poor widow.
[3457.62 → 3464.56] As I said, I preached this sermon two weeks ago.
[3464.58 → 3466.98] And the reason I preached it was assigned.
[3467.06 → 3471.42] It was the lectionary reading for that day, at least in the Anglican tradition.
[3472.44 → 3477.08] And it was the for the it was called All Saints Sunday.
[3477.58 → 3481.66] In the liturgical calendar, it's the first Sunday after All Saints' Day.
[3481.66 → 3483.98] So they call it All Saints Sunday.
[3484.28 → 3486.58] And they sort of celebrate the saints.
[3487.62 → 3492.66] Now, we kind of, in the Reformed tradition and a lot of Protestant traditions kind of have some issues with this.
[3492.66 → 3495.72] Because we say, well, all God's people are saints.
[3495.80 → 3499.84] All those, you know, saved and justified in Christ Jesus.
[3499.84 → 3503.30] But still, it got me thinking.
[3503.66 → 3505.18] We're celebrating the saints.
[3507.70 → 3514.02] How many saints do we just have no idea how saintly they are?
[3514.02 → 3524.76] And the people that we tend to sort of elevate, because we like to name buildings after them and wings of buildings and rooms.
[3525.32 → 3531.22] And then we have lists of, you know, you see them in hospitals and places like that, platinum givers.
[3531.66 → 3534.58] And, you know, they have all these levels of who's given this much.
[3534.72 → 3537.14] And, wow, those are the huge givers.
[3537.28 → 3540.48] And God looks at it so, so differently.
[3540.48 → 3543.44] And it's so easy to forget that.
[3544.46 → 3546.86] Who are the real saints?
[3547.62 → 3551.12] How many of them never, ever get noticed?
[3551.90 → 3553.86] But God knows.
[3555.54 → 3559.60] God knows who those real saints are.
[3564.26 → 3565.54] And what about us?
[3565.54 → 3567.38] Well, the challenge comes to us.
[3568.08 → 3569.44] Mostly privileged.
[3570.48 → 3573.58] How are we doing in terms of giving everything?
[3573.76 → 3575.34] And it's for all God's people.
[3577.28 → 3579.42] Tony Cam polo does this thing.
[3579.60 → 3585.22] Some of you probably have heard it when he, and I've heard others make it, but he does it so well.
[3585.42 → 3587.10] He talks about that song,
[3587.98 → 3590.18] All to Jesus I surrender.
[3590.54 → 3592.26] And he says, well, come on, let's be honest.
[3592.92 → 3594.76] One-tenth to Jesus I surrender.
[3595.12 → 3597.58] One-tenth to him, I freely give.
[3597.66 → 3598.78] Let's all join in on the chorus.
[3598.78 → 3600.72] Jesus I surrender.
[3600.72 → 3601.54] One-tenth.
[3601.54 → 3601.56] One-tenth.
[3601.56 → 3601.58] One-tenth.
[3601.58 → 3601.60] One-tenth.
[3601.60 → 3601.64] One-tenth.
[3601.64 → 3602.10] One-tenth.
[3602.10 → 3602.64] One-tenth.
[3602.64 → 3603.20] One-tenth.
[3603.20 → 3605.14] And, I mean, again, let's be honest.
[3605.14 → 3606.92] For how many is it one-tenth?
[3606.92 → 3608.04] One-tenth?
[3608.04 → 3610.74] One-twentieth or one-fiftieth or whatever the case is.
[3610.74 → 3614.96] I mean, all to Jesus I surrender?
[3614.96 → 3618.90] One-tenth.
[3618.90 → 3623.02] One poor widow who gave all.
[3624.76 → 3629.92] James Small, in his hymn, I've Found a Friend,
[3630.58 → 3632.50] has this verse, and I'll close with this.
[3634.36 → 3638.36] I've found a friend, oh, such a friend.
[3639.00 → 3642.24] He bled, he died to save me.
[3643.10 → 3645.76] And not alone the gift of life,
[3645.76 → 3649.34] but his own self he gave me.
[3650.18 → 3652.96] Not that I have, mine own I call.
[3653.58 → 3655.36] I hold it for the giver.
[3656.52 → 3660.52] My heart, my strength, my life, my all
[3660.52 → 3664.52] are his and his forever.
[3665.10 → 3665.64] Let's pray.
[3667.28 → 3671.42] Heavenly Father, thank you that you remind us
[3671.42 → 3676.34] in challenging ways, sometimes difficult ways,
[3676.68 → 3682.06] but also with these amazing examples of saints.
[3683.42 → 3685.06] Hidden saints.
[3686.18 → 3687.46] Like this widow.
[3688.50 → 3690.22] Who puts the scribes,
[3690.68 → 3693.88] the honoured, respected scribes, to shame.
[3693.88 → 3703.78] Open our eyes to see the world the way you do.
[3705.68 → 3708.20] And open our hearts and our lives
[3708.20 → 3711.10] so that we too can follow that example
[3711.10 → 3713.58] of giving all that we have,
[3713.70 → 3715.36] all our lives.
[3715.36 → 3721.00] And thank you for your calling.
[3721.82 → 3723.60] And it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[3724.00 → 3724.32] Amen.
[3724.32 → 3724.40] Amen.
[3724.40 → 3726.40] Amen.
[3754.40 → 3768.82] All for Jesus, all I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3768.82 → 3786.82] All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans, I surrender these into your hands.
[3786.82 → 3808.08] For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3808.08 → 3825.30] Jesus, all for Jesus, all I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3825.30 → 3843.30] Jesus, all for Jesus, all I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3843.30 → 3861.30] All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans, I surrender these into your hands.
[3861.30 → 3871.30] For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3871.30 → 3882.30] For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3883.30 → 3899.30] Jesus, all for Jesus, all I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3899.30 → 3918.30] I just want to make one correction.
[3918.30 → 3923.30] Earlier I said that the gathering at 2.30 this afternoon is going to be at Delta View.
[3923.30 → 3928.30] It's actually going to be at Mountain View Manor, which is connected to the Delta Hospital.
[3928.30 → 3933.30] So I didn't want to be responsible for anybody driving out all the way to Delta View.
[3933.30 → 3937.30] Anyway, 2.30 this afternoon.
[3937.30 → 3941.30] This is a time for our community prayer.
[3941.30 → 3942.30] Let us pray.
[3942.30 → 3948.30] Now we offer our prayers and thanksgiving and intercession.
[3948.30 → 3954.30] May the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in your sight.
[3954.30 → 3957.30] O Lord, our Rock and Redeemer.
[3957.30 → 3960.30] Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[3960.30 → 3966.30] You created us in your image and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[3966.30 → 3974.30] We are thankful for the communities we live in, for the services we sometimes take for granted.
[3974.30 → 3985.30] For clean water, for public servants such as police, judges, doctors, nurses, firefighters, paramedics, and those involved in education.
[3985.30 → 3994.30] Bless all the frontline workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[3994.30 → 4004.30] We pray for our nation, for our Prime Minister, our Premier, and our mayors in the communities we represent, Delta, Richmond, and Surrey.
[4004.30 → 4012.30] Give them wisdom in their leadership, especially in this time of pandemic and dealing with flooding throughout the province.
[4012.30 → 4015.30] We pray for our province.
[4015.30 → 4022.30] We have seen the images of flooded farms in Abbotsford and highways washed out throughout the province.
[4022.30 → 4027.30] We pray for farmers and other persons affected by these floods.
[4027.30 → 4032.30] And bless all the efforts to restore dikes, farms, and highways.
[4032.30 → 4038.30] Comfort those families who have lost loved ones in the slides on Highway 99.
[4038.30 → 4045.30] We acknowledge that our infrastructure is so fragile and these floods have such far-reaching effects.
[4045.30 → 4051.30] Lord, may we acknowledge that you are the one steadfast in our lives.
[4051.30 → 4055.30] And may these events draw us and people closer to you.
[4055.30 → 4061.30] We ask for a blessing on the work of the Ministry to Seafarers here at Delta Port
[4061.30 → 4063.30] and the Port of Vancouver.
[4063.30 → 4068.30] We pray for a blessing on Pastor Gary and the other chaplains involved.
[4068.30 → 4078.30] So many seafarers are stuck on ships for up to a year at a time, which has implications for the health of the seafarers
[4078.30 → 4082.30] and their families which they don't see for sometimes up to a year.
[4082.30 → 4091.30] Even now, seafarers are stranded in our ports because they can't load or unload due to the rail lines being washed out.
[4091.30 → 4098.30] Even though container traffic is booming, the seafarers are not generally the ones that reap the benefits.
[4098.30 → 4103.30] Bless these sometime unseen and forgotten workers.
[4103.30 → 4106.30] We pray for our broken world.
[4106.30 → 4113.30] For Christians around this world, we especially want to remember Christians in the country of Iran.
[4113.30 → 4116.30] Many persons are coming to faith in Iran.
[4116.30 → 4118.30] Protect your church there.
[4118.30 → 4124.30] We pray for change of heart in the leadership to give more freedoms to Christian believers.
[4124.30 → 4130.30] We acknowledge the ongoing refugee crisis around the world.
[4130.30 → 4137.30] We pray for those refugees stuck at the Belarus-Polish border who are being used as political pawns.
[4137.30 → 4144.30] May wisdom prevail to defuse this situation and that all these refugees may find safety.
[4144.30 → 4152.30] We are thankful for the two families, the Areas and the Feshkosh Rafters, that we have been able to sponsor.
[4152.30 → 4162.30] Both of these families have been with us for a year now, and we ask a continued blessing on them as they continue to adjust in life in Canada.
[4162.30 → 4165.30] May we continue to be able to support them.
[4165.30 → 4168.30] We pray for our church.
[4168.30 → 4175.30] Bless our ministry leaders, for Pastor Jason, Associate Pastor Nancy, and our Children's Ministry Coordinator Hannah,
[4175.30 → 4177.30] and our elders and deacons.
[4177.30 → 4182.30] We are thankful for all the children and teachers involved in kids' life.
[4182.30 → 4187.30] We are also thankful that most of our ministries have been able to resume this fall.
[4187.30 → 4191.30] We are grateful for all the volunteers involved in all our ministries.
[4191.30 → 4195.30] Continue to bless the Chinese ministry in our church.
[4195.30 → 4200.30] May we continue to grow together so that we may be one body getting to know each other better.
[4200.30 → 4206.30] Now we want to bring some concerns about persons in our congregation.
[4206.30 → 4213.30] We pray for those listed in the prayer section of our bulletin, some living in care homes with limited amount of visiting.
[4213.30 → 4215.30] Bless them and be near to them.
[4215.30 → 4219.30] We bring before you Jerry and Joan Barman.
[4219.30 → 4226.30] Remember them in these difficult days as the doctors try different treatments for Joan's cancer.
[4226.30 → 4230.30] We pray that you will uphold both Jerry and Joan.
[4230.30 → 4235.30] We also want to remember Doug Anderson in his ongoing treatments for cancer.
[4235.30 → 4244.30] Bless both Doug and Nancy during this difficult time, and we are thankful that the hope and strength you have given both these families.
[4244.30 → 4251.30] We pray for the caregivers and family members as they support those who are sick.
[4251.30 → 4263.30] Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts, like mental illness or depression, addictions, and broken relationships in families and marriage.
[4263.30 → 4272.30] Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer,
[4272.30 → 4275.30] and to live faithfully in response to your call.
[4275.30 → 4279.30] Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[4279.30 → 4283.30] Allow Pastor Gary to come forward to give us the blessing.
[4283.30 → 4285.30] Thank you.
[4285.30 → 4297.30] Yeah, I invite you to rise as you are able.
[4297.30 → 4301.30] I'm going to give a blessing, actually a reading, and then a blessing.
[4301.30 → 4307.30] Marian actually suggested this, and I think it was really appropriate in light of what we've seen happening,
[4307.30 → 4312.30] the floods and the destruction over the past week.
[4312.30 → 4313.30] It's been quite a week.
[4313.30 → 4318.30] And so this is a reading from the end of the prophet Habakkuk.
[4318.30 → 4320.30] Now, I'm going to read the Bible.
[4320.30 → 4325.30] Though the fig tree does not bud, and there are no grapes on the vines.
[4325.30 → 4330.30] Though the olive crop fails, and the fields produce no food.
[4330.30 → 4341.30] Though there are no sheep, I suppose we could add, or cattle, or chickens, or whatever, in the pen, and no cattle in the stalls.
[4341.30 → 4345.30] Yet, I will rejoice in the Lord.
[4345.30 → 4349.30] I will be joyful in God my Saviour.
[4349.30 → 4351.30] And then this, let this be your blessing.
[4351.30 → 4355.30] The sovereign Lord, may He be your strength.
[4355.30 → 4359.30] May He make your feet like the feet of a deer.
[4359.30 → 4364.30] May He enable you to tread on the heights and through the depths.
[4364.30 → 4367.30] In Jesus' name. Amen.
[4367.30 → 4385.30] We will glorify the King of kings.
[4385.30 → 4390.30] We will glorify the Lamb.
[4390.30 → 4396.30] We will glorify the Lord of lords.
[4396.30 → 4401.30] Who is the great I am.
[4401.30 → 4407.30] Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty.
[4407.30 → 4412.30] We will bow before His throne.
[4412.30 → 4418.30] We will worship Him in righteousness.
[4418.30 → 4423.30] We will worship Him alone.
[4423.30 → 4429.30] He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth.
[4429.30 → 4434.30] He is Lord of all who live.
[4434.30 → 4440.30] He is Lord above the universe.
[4440.30 → 4445.30] All praise to Him, we give.
[4445.30 → 4449.30] All Perez through to hear
[4449.30 → 4450.30] the Wolf of know.
[4450.30 → 4451.30] All Perez through Evans
[4451.30 → 4452.30] through Evans.
[4452.30 → 4454.30] All chomp weather there.
[4454.30 → 4455.30] Alleluia to the King of kings.
[4455.30 → 4457.30] Alleluia to the lamb.
[4457.30 → 4462.30] Alleluia to the Lord of lords.
[4462.30 → 4466.44] Who is the great I am.
[4466.44 → 4469.44] Alleluia to the Lord of lords.
[4469.44 → 4471.44] Amen.
