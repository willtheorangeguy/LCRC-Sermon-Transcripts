[0.00 --> 5.00]  Earer sings
[6.00 --> 29.46]  Danielle
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[272.00 --> 274.00]  Amen.
[291.00 --> 292.00]  Good morning, everyone.
[292.00 --> 293.00]  Good morning.
[293.00 --> 298.94]  It's great to be with you this morning, to be gathered in the Lord's house, and to gather
[298.94 --> 301.00]  to worship the Lord together.
[301.00 --> 305.00]  And we're so grateful that you've joined us today, especially maybe if you were here for
[305.00 --> 311.40]  the first time, or if you've just been joining us recently, we especially want to welcome
[311.40 --> 312.40]  you.
[312.40 --> 313.40]  I'm Jason Truel.
[313.40 --> 317.40]  I'm the lead pastor here, and I will be leading us in worship this morning.
[317.40 --> 322.40]  And so before we begin, I want to mention a few things by way of announcements.
[322.40 --> 333.60]  One is that we are not required to wear masks, but in light of the escalation of cases, it's
[333.60 --> 336.40]  something that maybe we would recommend.
[336.40 --> 341.04]  Probably not a lot of you brought one today, but maybe next Sunday, if more of us could
[341.04 --> 342.04]  wear one.
[342.04 --> 344.44]  That might be a good idea.
[344.44 --> 347.16]  We'll see what happens in the news.
[347.16 --> 351.84]  Another thing is, in our denomination, there is a ministry called the Leadership Development
[351.84 --> 352.84]  Network.
[352.84 --> 356.44]  I know from our congregation, Marion has been a part of that.
[356.44 --> 359.70]  Well, they are getting ready to have a new enrollment.
[359.70 --> 363.04]  And Monday, tomorrow night, is an information session.
[363.04 --> 368.60]  So if you are at all interested in checking it out, maybe participating, let me know and
[368.60 --> 374.78]  I'll help get you connected with the information session.
[374.78 --> 381.48]  Another thing is that here in our sanctuary on October 2nd, we will be having, and it's
[381.48 --> 383.86]  in your bulletin, a gospel concert.
[383.86 --> 384.86]  This is part of our Chinese ministry.
[384.86 --> 387.68]  It's an outreach concert.
[387.68 --> 390.84]  And we're putting together a little choir.
[390.84 --> 396.14]  So if you are interested in singing, and I think the idea also is to get some of our younger
[396.14 --> 397.14]  people involved.
[397.14 --> 401.54]  If you are at all interested, please do sign up.
[401.54 --> 408.54]  There's a sign-up sheet at the table right outside the doors here.
[408.54 --> 415.92]  Our designated offering this Sunday is for our Ladner CRC Education Fund.
[415.92 --> 425.32]  And I think we are still not collecting an offering during our worship, but you can drop off a check
[425.32 --> 426.32]  at the table outside.
[426.32 --> 429.82]  You can also give online.
[429.82 --> 436.72]  So with all of that said, let's prepare for worship now by hearing these wonderful words
[436.72 --> 439.28]  from Psalm 91.
[439.28 --> 448.12]  And as we read these words, let's remember that God is looking upon us all the time.
[448.12 --> 450.52]  God is always looking upon us.
[450.52 --> 457.56]  And now as we come to worship and as God calls us to worship, we now quietly turn our gaze
[457.56 --> 458.56]  to God.
[458.56 --> 460.00]  So let's do that together in our hearts.
[460.00 --> 466.22]  Let's turn our gaze to God and let's read these words from Psalm 91.
[466.22 --> 476.46]  Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[476.46 --> 487.26]  I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[487.26 --> 491.76]  Friends I invite us now to take a moment of quietness.
[491.76 --> 512.76]  Let us rest for a moment in the knowledge that God is looking upon us, that God loves us.
[512.76 --> 515.94]  Let us pray together.
[515.94 --> 520.18]  Our holy and triune God, we praise you.
[520.18 --> 526.56]  God our Father, we praise you that you have made us, that you sustain our life, and that
[526.56 --> 529.26]  you love us.
[529.26 --> 536.00]  Lord Jesus Christ, we praise you that you have lived for us, you died for us, you have risen
[536.00 --> 540.22]  for us, and you now reign for us.
[540.22 --> 545.92]  Holy Spirit of God, we praise you that you commune with us, and are ever present with each
[545.92 --> 549.24]  of us in our disparate places.
[549.24 --> 555.50]  We praise you, holy triune God, Father, Son, and Spirit, that you watch over us, and in
[555.50 --> 560.26]  you and with you, we are safe and secure.
[560.26 --> 565.72]  Help us now and empower us in our worship, that it would be pleasing to you.
[565.72 --> 571.36]  We ask this in the name of Jesus our Savior, amen.
[571.36 --> 576.72]  God's greeting to us this morning comes from Isaiah 30, verse 15, which is one of my favorite
[576.72 --> 579.24]  verses in the Bible.
[579.24 --> 586.66]  This is what the sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel says, in repentance and rest is your
[586.66 --> 592.48]  salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength.
[592.48 --> 599.82]  So now friends, as a spiritual family that has been reconciled to one another through Christ,
[599.82 --> 604.66]  let's take a few moments as the Lord has greeted us to turn and greet those around us, and then
[604.66 --> 605.66]  we'll prepare to sing.
[634.66 --> 635.66]  Amen.
[635.66 --> 636.66]  Amen.
[636.66 --> 637.66]  Amen.
[637.66 --> 638.66]  Amen.
[638.66 --> 639.66]  Amen.
[639.66 --> 641.66]  Amen.
[669.66 --> 675.96]  Praise Him for He is your health and salvation.
[677.84 --> 693.28]  Come all who hear, brothers and sisters all near, join me in glad adoration.
[693.28 --> 707.28]  Praise to the Lord who wore all things his wondrously reigning.
[707.28 --> 717.28]  Sheltering you under His wings, oh, so gently sustaining.
[717.28 --> 734.74]  Have you not seen all that is needful has been sent by His gracious Lord?
[734.74 --> 736.74]  Amen.
[736.74 --> 738.74]  Amen.
[738.74 --> 740.74]  Amen.
[740.74 --> 766.14]  Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him.
[766.14 --> 777.48]  All that has life and breath, come now with praise and glory for Him.
[777.48 --> 787.32]  Let me amen, sound from His people again.
[787.32 --> 797.32]  Glory forever and all, O let all that is in me adore Him.
[797.32 --> 810.40]  The next song that we're going to sing is God Himself is with us.
[810.40 --> 812.62]  And we have a reflection on it.
[812.70 --> 816.48]  And I wonder while I'm reading this reflection if we could all be seated.
[816.78 --> 818.94]  And then after that we'll rise again, stand again.
[818.94 --> 829.48]  1 John 14, or in John 14, verses 16 through 17, Jesus said,
[830.48 --> 836.28]  I will ask the Father and He will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever.
[836.86 --> 838.22]  The Spirit of Truth.
[839.50 --> 843.54]  Jesus promised that the Father would give us another advocate, the Holy Spirit.
[843.54 --> 848.30]  Jesus said that this advocate would be with us forever.
[849.08 --> 852.98]  But unlike Jesus who walked with His followers for a limited time,
[853.72 --> 856.40]  the Holy Spirit will be our constant companion.
[857.10 --> 859.00]  He is God with us.
[860.10 --> 863.54]  Jesus also said that this advocate would help us.
[864.48 --> 867.58]  The Holy Spirit does not just walk with us.
[868.14 --> 870.98]  He helps us to live holy and godly lives.
[870.98 --> 873.86]  He teaches us the things of God.
[874.22 --> 877.30]  And He empowers us for service in the kingdom.
[878.60 --> 882.60]  So, just what does God is with us mean?
[884.16 --> 889.68]  God is with us has a special meaning to those who have surrendered to the Lordship of Jesus.
[890.76 --> 897.36]  God, in the person of the Holy Spirit, is with us in a very personal and intimate way.
[897.36 --> 901.28]  The God of all creation lives within us.
[901.94 --> 903.94]  He comforts us in challenging times.
[904.72 --> 906.42]  He teaches us His ways.
[906.92 --> 909.04]  And He enables us to serve Him.
[910.38 --> 912.24]  That means that we are never alone.
[913.18 --> 916.14]  Even in our darkest times, He is with us.
[916.82 --> 919.74]  We can trust that no matter what might come our way,
[920.42 --> 921.94]  He will keep us safe.
[921.94 --> 927.72]  We can have no greater privilege than to have God with us.
[928.66 --> 931.26]  Shall we stand and sing that God is with us?
[931.26 --> 961.24]  God is with us.
[961.26 --> 962.26]  God is with us.
[962.26 --> 963.26]  God is with us.
[963.26 --> 967.26]  God is with us.
[967.26 --> 972.10]  God is in His temple.
[972.10 --> 977.64]  All within deep silence.
[977.64 --> 984.98]  Prostrate, lined with deepest reverence.
[984.98 --> 1000.98]  God is with us.
[1000.98 --> 1001.98]  God is with us.
[1001.98 --> 1005.98]  God is with us.
[1005.98 --> 1009.60]  His із
[1009.60 --> 1032.52]  nella
[1032.52 --> 1037.12]  angels sings their voices
[1037.12 --> 1039.30]  blending
[1039.30 --> 1046.80]  bow your ear to us here
[1046.80 --> 1051.48]  hear oh Christ the praises
[1051.48 --> 1059.04]  let your church now raise us
[1062.52 --> 1066.52]  Samuel
[1066.52 --> 1083.84]  O Lord for mercy
[1083.84 --> 1087.84]  Lord have I've
[1087.84 --> 1089.66]  believed
[1089.66 --> 1095.58]  Trusting the people of heaven
[1095.58 --> 1102.84]  Like the holy angels
[1102.84 --> 1108.16]  Open up your glory
[1108.16 --> 1114.02]  Revises the spirit of glory
[1114.02 --> 1121.68]  And the old, great and small
[1121.68 --> 1127.18]  Seek to prove us clearly
[1127.18 --> 1133.06]  What you know so clearly
[1144.02 --> 1166.52]  Some trust in chariots
[1166.52 --> 1170.16]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1170.16 --> 1173.02]  Some trust in horses
[1173.02 --> 1177.24]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1177.24 --> 1182.10]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1182.10 --> 1189.16]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1189.16 --> 1193.92]  His love never fails
[1193.92 --> 1197.80]  His name will always prevail
[1197.80 --> 1204.88]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1204.88 --> 1207.94]  Some trust in the work they do
[1207.94 --> 1211.66]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1211.66 --> 1215.02]  Cause by His grace all the work is through
[1215.02 --> 1218.66]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1218.66 --> 1229.74]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1229.74 --> 1231.80]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1231.80 --> 1235.26]  His love never fails
[1235.26 --> 1238.74]  His name will always prevail
[1238.74 --> 1244.82]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1244.82 --> 1251.88]  Oh glory to the name of the Lord our God
[1251.88 --> 1257.94]  The name of the Lord our God
[1257.94 --> 1269.02]  Oh glory to the name of the Lord our God
[1269.02 --> 1272.96]  The name of the Lord our God
[1272.96 --> 1275.74]  Some trust in the wealth of things
[1275.74 --> 1279.02]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1279.02 --> 1282.26]  The name worth more than anything
[1282.26 --> 1286.10]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1286.10 --> 1291.18]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1291.18 --> 1297.18]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1297.78 --> 1315.06]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1315.06 --> 1320.26]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God
[1320.26 --> 1332.84]  So we come now to our time of confession.
[1333.54 --> 1338.12]  And that simply means that we tell God what is true about ourselves,
[1338.12 --> 1343.16]  that we often sin against God and others.
[1344.54 --> 1347.54]  And that's not the way that God has created us to live,
[1347.54 --> 1352.40]  but because of his love, he sent Jesus, our Savior, to die for us, to forgive us.
[1352.82 --> 1355.48]  So now we can freely come before him.
[1356.20 --> 1360.88]  And it's not so much that we're asking Jesus to pay for our sins again,
[1360.88 --> 1362.72]  that it has been done once and for all,
[1362.80 --> 1367.80]  but rather confession helps us to feel restored in our relationship with God.
[1367.92 --> 1369.56]  And so as part of our worship,
[1370.36 --> 1375.28]  the confession we will read today has been adapted from the prayer of the prophet Daniel.
[1375.28 --> 1378.00]  So we will pray corporately first,
[1378.20 --> 1381.96]  and then we will take a minute to silently confess our sins to God.
[1382.34 --> 1385.54]  So would you join me in reading this corporate prayer?
[1386.68 --> 1390.26]  O Lord, the great and awesome God,
[1390.86 --> 1397.52]  who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments.
[1397.52 --> 1404.04]  We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled,
[1404.50 --> 1407.90]  turning aside from your commandments and rules.
[1409.14 --> 1411.72]  Now, therefore, O our God,
[1412.16 --> 1417.44]  listen to the prayer of your servant and to my pleas for mercy.
[1417.44 --> 1424.58]  For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness,
[1425.46 --> 1428.02]  but because of your great mercy.
[1428.86 --> 1430.04]  O Lord, hear.
[1430.72 --> 1432.22]  O Lord, forgive.
[1432.22 --> 1432.44]  O Lord, forgive.
[1450.44 --> 1457.78]  Brothers and sisters, hear these words of God's gracious, steadfast love to us from 1 John.
[1457.78 --> 1464.36]  My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.
[1465.20 --> 1468.96]  But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
[1469.54 --> 1471.08]  Jesus Christ, the righteous one.
[1471.60 --> 1475.32]  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins,
[1475.84 --> 1480.52]  and not only for ours, but also for the sins of the whole world.
[1481.62 --> 1482.52]  Praise be to God.
[1482.86 --> 1486.12]  Would you please rise and let us sing a song of response?
[1486.12 --> 1516.10]  Let us sing a song of response.
[1516.12 --> 1517.66]  Onezony Pilate and!
[1517.66 --> 1518.62]  Our Old Lord,?
[1518.62 --> 1519.62]  Praise be to God.
[1519.62 --> 1519.76]  Here we watch Jesus Christ, the Élнее Pilate,
[1519.96 --> 1521.40]  ourванī Hughes Scripture, the Adoncilian Morning Lord,
[1521.40 --> 1522.62]  and as should be filled with His glory.
[1522.62 --> 1523.96]  By the thunderous we must,
[1523.96 --> 1528.40]  God supreme things,
[1528.40 --> 1528.94]  His glory as He has become,
[1531.08 --> 1533.48] alous touching on our be烈 plants,
[1535.00 --> 1535.18]  He leads me by the snow.
[1535.18 --> 1536.68]  He leads me by the snow,
[1536.68 --> 1536.80]  still waters,
[1536.88 --> 1537.34]  His goodness restores my soul,
[1537.34 --> 1538.42]  His goodness restores my soul,
[1538.42 --> 1539.36]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1541.36 --> 1541.44]  Sure ana�� zooimità,
[1541.44 --> 1542.36]  And I will trust in you alone.
[1542.36 --> 1542.88]  Byeî
[1546.12 --> 1555.52]  For your endless mercy follows me
[1555.52 --> 1561.88]  Your goodness will lead me home
[1561.88 --> 1567.96]  He guides my ways in righteousness
[1567.96 --> 1576.10]  And he annoys my head with hope
[1576.10 --> 1584.30]  And my God it overflows with joy
[1584.30 --> 1590.64]  I feast on his pure delights
[1590.64 --> 1596.54]  And I will trust in you alone
[1596.54 --> 1603.54]  And I will trust in you alone
[1603.54 --> 1612.74]  For your endless mercy follows me
[1612.74 --> 1618.08]  Your goodness will lead me home
[1618.08 --> 1627.28]  And though I walk the darkest path
[1627.28 --> 1634.48]  I will not fear the evil one
[1634.48 --> 1641.48]  For you are with me and will run, O stand
[1641.48 --> 1648.68]  Are the comfort I need to know
[1648.68 --> 1654.68]  And I will trust in you alone
[1654.68 --> 1662.88]  And I will trust in you alone
[1662.88 --> 1669.88]  For your endless mercy follows me
[1669.88 --> 1678.08]  Your goodness will lead me home
[1678.08 --> 1687.28]  At this time
[1687.28 --> 1688.94]  The children are dismissed
[1688.94 --> 1691.28]  To go to their Sunday school classes
[1691.28 --> 1701.54]  So we are going to start something
[1701.54 --> 1703.18]  I think a bit new
[1703.18 --> 1704.78]  Or at least new in recent times
[1704.78 --> 1707.26]  Which is that in our worship committee
[1707.26 --> 1711.32]  We talked about how can we include
[1711.32 --> 1714.30]  And allow more people to participate in our worship
[1714.30 --> 1715.54]  And what we thought we should do
[1715.54 --> 1719.16]  Is invite anybody who is willing and wanting to
[1719.16 --> 1721.74]  To read the scripture passage for us
[1721.74 --> 1722.54]  Before the message
[1722.54 --> 1723.04]  And so
[1723.04 --> 1727.20]  Abbas our brave brother has agreed to go first
[1727.20 --> 1730.72]  So let us hear God's word
[1730.72 --> 1733.94]  Psalm 125
[1733.94 --> 1739.88]  Those who trust in the Lord are like mankind
[1739.88 --> 1743.72]  We cannot be shaken but endure forever
[1743.72 --> 1746.74]  As the mountains surround Jerusalem
[1746.74 --> 1749.24]  So the Lord surrounds his people
[1749.24 --> 1751.68]  Both now and forevermore
[1751.68 --> 1756.32]  The scepter of the wicked will not remain
[1756.32 --> 1758.84]  Over the land allotted to the righteous
[1758.84 --> 1762.96]  For then the righteous might use their hand
[1762.96 --> 1764.18]  To do evil
[1764.18 --> 1767.84]  Lord do good to those who are good
[1767.84 --> 1771.10]  To those who are upright in your heart
[1771.10 --> 1774.12]  But those who turn the crooked way
[1774.12 --> 1778.30]  The Lord will banish with the evil door
[1778.30 --> 1780.16]  Peace be unto Israel
[1780.16 --> 1781.92]  This is the word of the Lord
[1781.92 --> 1783.54]  Thanks be to God
[1783.54 --> 1785.50]  Thank you
[1785.50 --> 1791.00]  So it's great to be back with you again
[1791.00 --> 1795.50]  We were kind of like away for four weeks
[1795.50 --> 1796.80]  But we were here a lot
[1796.80 --> 1798.24]  Worshipping with you
[1798.24 --> 1801.62]  And what we're going to do now
[1801.62 --> 1804.26]  Is pick back up in the sermon series
[1804.26 --> 1805.72]  That we started earlier in the summer
[1805.72 --> 1806.84]  And that we will continue
[1806.84 --> 1808.84]  And we'll lead into the early part of the fall
[1808.84 --> 1811.28]  And it's a series called Songs for the Journey
[1811.28 --> 1813.54]  And we're looking at the Psalms of Ascent
[1813.54 --> 1816.34]  Which is a collection of 15 psalms
[1816.34 --> 1817.60]  Within the Psalter
[1817.60 --> 1820.72]  And today we're going to be looking at Psalm 125
[1820.72 --> 1822.74]  Which Abbas read for us
[1822.74 --> 1825.08]  And I get the privilege this morning
[1825.08 --> 1828.08]  Of encouraging and reminding us
[1828.08 --> 1830.40]  Of what this psalm is all about
[1830.40 --> 1833.98]  Psalm 125 is about the security
[1833.98 --> 1836.96]  That God provides for his people
[1836.96 --> 1839.00]  Security, that's the theme
[1839.00 --> 1843.28]  And it tells us that amidst the ups and downs
[1843.28 --> 1844.18]  Of our lives
[1844.18 --> 1845.76]  We can trust in a God
[1845.76 --> 1848.68]  Who makes us secure
[1848.68 --> 1852.82]  And that's what I want us to live by
[1852.82 --> 1856.88]  That's what I want us to be encouraged by this morning
[1856.88 --> 1859.08]  And so would you join me in prayer
[1859.08 --> 1860.28]  As we come before the Lord
[1860.28 --> 1861.68]  And prepare to hear his word
[1861.68 --> 1864.06]  Father we ask
[1864.06 --> 1867.22]  That by your powerful presence
[1867.22 --> 1871.26]  The wonderful counselor of the Holy Spirit
[1871.26 --> 1874.46]  Lord that you would reveal yourself to us
[1874.46 --> 1875.14]  Through your word
[1875.14 --> 1877.44]  Lord we thank you that it is true
[1877.44 --> 1879.32]  And that it is good
[1879.32 --> 1881.24]  And that you've spoken it to us
[1881.24 --> 1884.06]  Because of your great and steadfast love for us
[1884.06 --> 1887.46]  Lord teach us how to be your people in this world
[1887.46 --> 1889.18]  We pray in his holy name
[1889.18 --> 1889.70]  Amen
[1889.70 --> 1892.86]  So about ten years ago
[1892.86 --> 1897.30]  There's this American insurance company called Allstate
[1897.30 --> 1898.72]  I don't know if you've heard about it here
[1898.72 --> 1902.52]  But they introduced a new ad campaign
[1902.52 --> 1906.42]  That featured a character named Mayhem
[1906.42 --> 1910.88]  Now Mayhem is a devious guy
[1910.88 --> 1912.98]  But pretty funny character
[1912.98 --> 1915.26]  Played by the actor Dean Winters
[1915.26 --> 1917.00]  And these commercials are so fascinating
[1917.00 --> 1921.30]  Because not only does Mr. Mayhem play the narrator
[1921.30 --> 1923.38]  He kind of he's you know telling about what's happening
[1923.38 --> 1928.82]  But he's also the personification of everything terrible
[1928.82 --> 1930.68]  That could happen to you
[1930.68 --> 1932.42]  Mayhem right
[1932.42 --> 1937.24]  And he takes that role of disaster and mayhem
[1937.24 --> 1939.74]  And all sorts of forms
[1939.74 --> 1942.18]  Right so this is ten years of commercials
[1942.18 --> 1944.72]  All kinds of mayhem that happens to us
[1944.72 --> 1945.56]  So in one commercial
[1945.56 --> 1948.68]  Mayhem plays the role of your family dog
[1948.68 --> 1952.68]  Who happily welcomes the burglars into your house
[1952.68 --> 1954.14]  Thinking it is making new friends
[1954.14 --> 1956.32]  While they steal everything in your house
[1956.32 --> 1958.84]  In another commercial
[1958.84 --> 1962.40]  Mayhem is the teenage driver of a pink SUV
[1962.40 --> 1965.66]  Who smashes into your car in the parking lot
[1965.66 --> 1967.08]  While texting her friends
[1967.08 --> 1969.94]  In another commercial
[1969.94 --> 1974.16]  Mayhem is an adorable four-year-old ring bearer
[1974.16 --> 1975.10]  At a wedding
[1975.10 --> 1979.24]  Who has the terrible habit of swallowing stuff
[1979.24 --> 1981.24]  Including wedding rings
[1981.24 --> 1983.66]  But he still won't eat his broccoli
[1983.66 --> 1987.14]  And so these commercials are very entertaining
[1987.14 --> 1990.04]  And they've actually become one of the longest running ad campaigns
[1990.04 --> 1991.24]  In television history
[1991.24 --> 1992.58]  And so we might ask
[1992.58 --> 1994.58]  Well why are they so popular and successful?
[1994.58 --> 1996.40]  Part of the reason is
[1996.40 --> 1998.04]  They're super entertaining and funny
[1998.04 --> 1998.82]  It's great acting
[1998.82 --> 2001.34]  But also part of the reason is that
[2001.34 --> 2004.36]  There's something that we can all relate to
[2004.36 --> 2005.30]  Right?
[2005.36 --> 2009.00]  We all know that mayhem is everywhere
[2009.00 --> 2012.90]  Mayhem can strike at any time
[2012.90 --> 2015.62]  And in this kind of world that we live in
[2015.62 --> 2016.94]  A world that is broken
[2016.94 --> 2017.84]  That is fallen
[2017.84 --> 2019.48]  That is not the way it's supposed to be
[2019.48 --> 2022.98]  Mayhem can be anywhere and everywhere
[2022.98 --> 2026.48]  Mayhem is always going to be part of your life
[2026.48 --> 2031.08]  Let's think about where we see mayhem
[2031.08 --> 2033.02]  In the face of a global pandemic
[2033.02 --> 2035.60]  We see that mayhem can be microscopic
[2035.60 --> 2042.36]  In the face of uncovering the unmarked graves of indigenous children
[2042.36 --> 2045.40]  We see that mayhem can be institutional and systemic
[2045.40 --> 2048.22]  In the face of wildfires
[2048.22 --> 2050.76]  We see that mayhem can wreak havoc on the environment
[2050.76 --> 2055.98]  In the face of our own personal sins against God and others
[2055.98 --> 2061.40]  We see that mayhem takes root in our hearts and in our minds
[2061.40 --> 2063.90]  So the question is
[2063.90 --> 2065.20]  What do we do with mayhem?
[2067.10 --> 2069.04]  We need to find security, don't we?
[2069.50 --> 2071.68]  We need to find protection
[2071.68 --> 2075.62]  To keep us safe from all of this disaster
[2075.62 --> 2078.38]  And so at the end of every Allstate commercial
[2078.38 --> 2079.66]  There's always a question
[2079.66 --> 2081.38]  The question is
[2081.38 --> 2083.06]  Are you in good hands?
[2083.62 --> 2083.84]  Right?
[2083.88 --> 2084.84]  They want to sell you insurance
[2084.84 --> 2087.68]  Are you in good hands?
[2089.08 --> 2090.58]  I'm not going to sell you insurance
[2090.58 --> 2093.76]  But that is the question for us this morning
[2093.76 --> 2098.72]  Are you in good hands?
[2100.08 --> 2102.94]  That's in a way the question that this psalm is asking
[2102.94 --> 2105.66]  In the face of the world's mayhem
[2105.66 --> 2108.44]  In the face of so much uncertainty and trouble in life
[2108.44 --> 2110.06]  Are you in good hands?
[2110.14 --> 2112.40]  What will keep you safe?
[2113.78 --> 2116.76]  And Psalm 125 is inviting us
[2116.76 --> 2119.44]  Into the security
[2119.44 --> 2121.76]  The safest place we could ever be
[2121.76 --> 2126.58]  Which is in the protective, loving hands of God
[2126.58 --> 2129.02]  So let's look at this psalm together
[2129.02 --> 2133.22]  And we're going to consider God's loving presence
[2133.22 --> 2135.62]  And his security for his people
[2135.62 --> 2138.30]  And I want to look at three ways
[2138.30 --> 2141.88]  That God promises us his security in this psalm
[2141.88 --> 2143.02]  And the first is this
[2143.02 --> 2143.90]  You see it on the screen
[2143.90 --> 2149.60]  God secures us with his immovable stability
[2149.60 --> 2152.54]  So now we've looked at so far
[2152.54 --> 2155.50]  Five of the previous songs of Ascent
[2155.50 --> 2158.00]  And the context of those psalms
[2158.00 --> 2158.58]  If you remember
[2158.58 --> 2161.22]  Is that God's people are taking a journey to Jerusalem
[2161.22 --> 2162.14]  Right?
[2162.32 --> 2163.92]  And this is a journey they would have taken
[2163.92 --> 2165.06]  Two or three times a year
[2165.06 --> 2168.00]  And that journey is used by the psalmist
[2168.00 --> 2169.38]  As a metaphor
[2169.38 --> 2171.56]  To describe our life with God
[2171.56 --> 2172.68]  A life, the spiritual life
[2172.68 --> 2173.82]  As a journey toward God
[2173.82 --> 2175.98]  Now here in Psalm 125
[2175.98 --> 2178.64]  This is a little different
[2178.64 --> 2180.04]  Because it's taking
[2180.04 --> 2181.60]  Not the journey
[2181.60 --> 2183.42]  But the city of Jerusalem
[2183.42 --> 2186.48]  As the metaphor for our life with God
[2186.48 --> 2189.02]  So look at what verse 1 says
[2189.02 --> 2189.98]  It says
[2189.98 --> 2191.78]  Those who trust in the Lord
[2191.78 --> 2194.00]  Are like Mount Zion
[2194.00 --> 2195.92]  Which cannot be shaken
[2195.92 --> 2197.76]  But endures forever
[2197.76 --> 2200.02]  So let's think about Jerusalem
[2200.02 --> 2202.46]  Jerusalem was a city
[2202.46 --> 2204.98]  Built on a very high hill
[2204.98 --> 2207.28]  In the southern mountain range of Israel
[2207.28 --> 2209.00]  And then within the city of Jerusalem
[2209.00 --> 2211.52]  The temple was built on the highest point
[2211.52 --> 2213.38]  In the city on Mount Zion
[2213.38 --> 2215.96]  And so the psalmist
[2215.96 --> 2218.16]  He's been to Jerusalem
[2218.16 --> 2219.82]  He has seen the temple
[2219.82 --> 2222.18]  He's seen the temple on Mount Zion
[2222.18 --> 2224.60]  And he's writing this
[2224.60 --> 2225.60]  And he's imagining
[2225.60 --> 2228.52]  The strength of the city
[2228.52 --> 2231.52]  The stability of it
[2231.52 --> 2232.82]  And he's thinking to himself
[2232.82 --> 2233.56]  Well you know
[2233.56 --> 2237.44]  My soul is like that
[2237.44 --> 2238.76]  He's saying that
[2238.76 --> 2240.98]  For someone who trusts in the Lord
[2240.98 --> 2242.90]  They can never be shaken
[2242.90 --> 2246.74]  They're like this rock solid mountain
[2246.74 --> 2248.66]  That nothing can move it
[2248.66 --> 2251.18]  Brothers and sisters
[2251.18 --> 2252.86]  The promise of this psalm
[2252.86 --> 2254.74]  Is that your soul
[2254.74 --> 2257.58]  Can be that secure
[2257.58 --> 2258.80]  Right
[2258.80 --> 2261.22]  As immovable as Mount Zion
[2261.22 --> 2263.40]  When you trust in the living God
[2263.40 --> 2265.46]  Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[2265.46 --> 2268.38]  But I think the reality
[2268.38 --> 2269.42]  For many of us
[2269.42 --> 2271.28]  Is that we can struggle
[2271.28 --> 2272.76]  To put our trust
[2272.76 --> 2274.02]  In God in that way
[2274.02 --> 2275.60]  That is to say
[2275.60 --> 2276.92]  Rather than trusting in the Lord
[2276.92 --> 2278.70]  We actually sometimes put our trust
[2278.70 --> 2280.14]  In something else
[2280.14 --> 2281.54]  In other things
[2281.54 --> 2282.34]  Right
[2282.34 --> 2283.50]  We all long for
[2283.50 --> 2284.88]  An immovable security
[2284.88 --> 2285.66]  In our lives
[2285.66 --> 2287.10]  And like many things
[2287.10 --> 2288.32]  In our culture today
[2288.32 --> 2290.00]  Experiencing security
[2290.00 --> 2291.46]  Is something that we're told
[2291.46 --> 2292.78]  That we need to create
[2292.78 --> 2293.56]  For ourselves
[2293.56 --> 2294.84]  Right
[2294.84 --> 2296.52]  Whether it's trusting
[2296.52 --> 2298.26]  In the right institutions
[2298.26 --> 2300.22]  Whether it's business
[2300.22 --> 2301.14]  Or politics
[2301.14 --> 2303.04]  Or trusting in the right brands
[2303.04 --> 2305.20]  Or establishing the right relationships
[2305.20 --> 2305.92]  And connections
[2305.92 --> 2308.26]  Or taking the proper steps
[2308.26 --> 2310.14]  To secure our health
[2310.14 --> 2311.12]  Or our finances
[2311.12 --> 2312.88]  It is up to you and me
[2312.88 --> 2315.00]  To create our own sense of security
[2315.00 --> 2317.54]  But many of us know
[2317.54 --> 2317.84]  By experience
[2318.42 --> 2319.18]  That the things
[2319.18 --> 2320.20]  That we often end up
[2320.20 --> 2321.44]  Looking to for security
[2321.44 --> 2324.06]  End up letting us down
[2324.06 --> 2325.70]  Why does that happen?
[2325.78 --> 2326.34]  Well because
[2326.34 --> 2328.06]  Circumstances change
[2328.06 --> 2328.76]  Right
[2328.76 --> 2329.44]  Mayhem
[2329.44 --> 2330.64]  Happens
[2330.64 --> 2331.98]  The tides
[2331.98 --> 2333.76]  Of our lives
[2333.76 --> 2334.64]  Are always
[2334.64 --> 2335.40]  Shifting
[2335.40 --> 2336.58]  And changing
[2336.58 --> 2337.98]  And so the security
[2337.98 --> 2338.74]  That we set up
[2338.74 --> 2339.52]  For ourselves
[2339.52 --> 2340.14]  Ends up
[2340.14 --> 2341.78]  Being not immovable
[2341.78 --> 2342.86]  But movable
[2342.86 --> 2344.36]  It ends up not being secure
[2344.36 --> 2345.08]  But insecure
[2345.08 --> 2346.60]  It's not stable
[2346.60 --> 2348.14]  And it lets us down
[2348.14 --> 2349.28]  And the things
[2349.28 --> 2350.20]  That we often turn to
[2350.20 --> 2351.66]  For our security
[2351.66 --> 2352.86]  And our identity
[2352.86 --> 2354.82]  They often end up
[2354.82 --> 2355.76]  Letting us down
[2355.76 --> 2357.50]  And then creating in us
[2357.50 --> 2358.88]  The exact opposite effect
[2358.88 --> 2359.48]  Which is
[2359.48 --> 2360.46]  Stress
[2360.46 --> 2361.56]  Insecurity
[2361.56 --> 2362.72]  And fear
[2362.72 --> 2364.78]  Maybe thinking right now
[2364.78 --> 2366.64]  About creating security
[2366.64 --> 2367.10]  In your life
[2367.10 --> 2368.16]  Is making you feel anxious
[2368.16 --> 2371.54]  And this is why we need
[2371.54 --> 2372.84]  A constant
[2372.84 --> 2375.24]  And immovable
[2375.24 --> 2376.60]  Source of security
[2376.60 --> 2377.72]  And friends
[2377.72 --> 2378.16]  That's where
[2378.16 --> 2379.12]  Psalm 125
[2379.12 --> 2380.22]  Confronts us
[2380.22 --> 2382.22]  And comforts us
[2382.22 --> 2383.06]  With the truth
[2383.06 --> 2385.22]  That those who trust
[2385.22 --> 2385.90]  In the Lord
[2385.90 --> 2387.70]  Will stand forever
[2387.70 --> 2389.32]  Will endure forever
[2389.32 --> 2390.48]  They are immovable
[2390.48 --> 2392.12]  You know
[2392.12 --> 2393.04]  Think about
[2393.04 --> 2394.82]  Jesus' teachings
[2394.82 --> 2395.62]  Think about
[2395.62 --> 2396.70]  Jesus in the
[2396.70 --> 2397.70]  Sermon on the Mount
[2397.70 --> 2398.90]  Where he talked about
[2398.90 --> 2401.56]  A very wise person
[2401.56 --> 2403.44]  Who obeyed his word
[2403.44 --> 2405.22]  He was like a man
[2405.22 --> 2406.38]  Who built his house
[2406.38 --> 2407.06]  On the rock
[2407.06 --> 2409.20]  And there was a foolish man
[2409.20 --> 2410.36]  Who did not obey
[2410.36 --> 2411.16]  Jesus' word
[2411.16 --> 2411.98]  And he was like a man
[2411.98 --> 2412.68]  Who built his house
[2412.68 --> 2413.26]  On the sand
[2413.26 --> 2414.72]  And then in that parable
[2414.72 --> 2415.34]  What happens?
[2416.46 --> 2417.32]  Both houses
[2417.32 --> 2419.76]  Experience the storm
[2419.76 --> 2420.16]  Don't they?
[2420.94 --> 2421.66]  Both houses
[2421.66 --> 2424.22]  Experience difficulty
[2424.22 --> 2426.08]  Unforeseen circumstances
[2426.08 --> 2428.08]  But one house
[2428.08 --> 2428.98]  Stands secure
[2428.98 --> 2431.08]  The other house
[2431.08 --> 2432.16]  Falls
[2432.16 --> 2432.80]  And Jesus
[2432.80 --> 2433.92]  Emphasizes it
[2433.92 --> 2434.60]  And he says
[2434.60 --> 2435.86]  And great
[2435.86 --> 2436.96]  Was its fall
[2436.96 --> 2439.26]  So friends
[2439.26 --> 2440.38]  The source of security
[2440.38 --> 2441.66]  We are looking for
[2441.66 --> 2443.54]  Comes from trusting
[2443.54 --> 2444.88]  And walking with the Lord
[2444.88 --> 2446.54]  With obeying his word
[2446.54 --> 2447.62]  Not building
[2447.62 --> 2448.80]  Our own security
[2448.80 --> 2449.86]  That's like building
[2449.86 --> 2450.38]  Our house
[2450.38 --> 2451.16]  On the sand
[2451.16 --> 2452.22]  It breaks
[2452.22 --> 2453.32]  When hardship comes
[2453.32 --> 2456.10]  And I also think
[2456.10 --> 2456.68]  It's important
[2456.68 --> 2457.30]  To note
[2457.30 --> 2459.58]  That in Jesus' parable
[2459.58 --> 2461.40]  And in Psalm 125
[2461.40 --> 2463.46]  It is assumed
[2463.46 --> 2464.60]  That God's people
[2464.60 --> 2466.54]  Are going to
[2466.54 --> 2467.50]  Experience hardship
[2467.50 --> 2469.86]  Jesus tells us
[2469.86 --> 2470.74]  That whether you
[2470.74 --> 2471.36]  Build your house
[2471.36 --> 2472.56]  On the solid rock
[2472.56 --> 2473.78]  Or on the sand
[2473.78 --> 2474.94]  Storms are going
[2474.94 --> 2475.42]  To come
[2475.42 --> 2476.82]  But the security
[2476.82 --> 2478.10]  That God provides
[2478.10 --> 2479.44]  Is immovable
[2479.44 --> 2480.44]  It stands forever
[2480.44 --> 2482.00]  And friends
[2482.00 --> 2482.54]  I can't think of
[2482.54 --> 2483.76]  A more comforting reality
[2483.76 --> 2484.58]  Right
[2484.58 --> 2485.42]  That even in the midst
[2485.42 --> 2486.32]  Of all the difficulties
[2486.32 --> 2486.86]  We face
[2486.86 --> 2487.88]  Especially in the last
[2487.88 --> 2489.66]  Going on two years
[2489.66 --> 2490.72]  With this pandemic
[2490.72 --> 2491.76]  The uncertainty
[2491.76 --> 2492.74]  Of our future
[2492.74 --> 2494.36]  The challenges
[2494.36 --> 2495.20]  Of our health
[2495.20 --> 2496.26]  And our relationships
[2496.26 --> 2497.30]  And all of the
[2497.30 --> 2498.82]  Mayhem that we face
[2498.82 --> 2500.18]  That the Lord promises
[2500.18 --> 2502.38]  An immovable security
[2502.38 --> 2502.94]  I mean we're going to
[2502.94 --> 2503.46]  Put our security
[2503.46 --> 2504.16]  In something right
[2504.16 --> 2506.30]  But what's it going to be
[2506.30 --> 2507.88]  God offers himself
[2507.88 --> 2509.50]  The God who is the same
[2509.50 --> 2509.96]  Yesterday
[2509.96 --> 2511.10]  Today and forever
[2511.10 --> 2513.36]  We can trust in him
[2513.36 --> 2514.60]  Or we can trust in something
[2514.60 --> 2516.06]  That is not going to last
[2516.06 --> 2517.38]  What's it going to be
[2517.38 --> 2519.42]  God invites us
[2519.42 --> 2520.38]  To put our trust in him
[2520.38 --> 2521.68]  He is this
[2521.68 --> 2523.18]  Immovable stability
[2523.18 --> 2523.84]  For us
[2523.84 --> 2526.24]  So that's the first thing
[2526.24 --> 2527.00]  Now the second thing
[2527.00 --> 2528.06]  That we see in Psalm 125
[2528.06 --> 2530.24]  Is that God also secures us
[2530.24 --> 2530.98]  With his
[2530.98 --> 2532.70]  Protective presence
[2532.70 --> 2533.08]  Okay
[2533.08 --> 2534.00]  His protective presence
[2534.00 --> 2535.64]  That's what we see
[2535.64 --> 2537.28]  In verse 2
[2537.28 --> 2539.06]  It says
[2539.06 --> 2540.06]  Yes
[2540.06 --> 2540.58]  As the mountains
[2540.58 --> 2542.30]  Surround Jerusalem
[2542.30 --> 2543.90]  So the Lord
[2543.90 --> 2545.56]  Surrounds his people
[2545.56 --> 2547.20]  Both now
[2547.20 --> 2548.52]  And forevermore
[2548.52 --> 2550.80]  So not only
[2550.80 --> 2551.58]  Was Jerusalem
[2551.58 --> 2553.38]  Built on a mountain
[2553.38 --> 2555.04]  On Mount Zion
[2555.04 --> 2556.28]  But it was also
[2556.28 --> 2557.36]  Surrounded
[2557.36 --> 2558.58]  By hills
[2558.58 --> 2560.12]  Almost on every side
[2560.12 --> 2562.38]  So Charles Spurgeon
[2562.38 --> 2563.26]  Once said
[2563.26 --> 2563.78]  In a sermon
[2563.78 --> 2564.50]  That the hills
[2564.50 --> 2565.98]  Are like sentinels
[2565.98 --> 2568.22]  To guard Jerusalem's gates
[2568.22 --> 2571.38]  And so that geographical position
[2571.38 --> 2572.80]  Made Jerusalem
[2572.80 --> 2573.64]  One of the strongest
[2573.64 --> 2574.96]  One of the most
[2574.96 --> 2576.36]  Fortified
[2576.36 --> 2577.78]  And defensible cities
[2577.78 --> 2578.74]  In the ancient world
[2578.74 --> 2581.08]  And so just like
[2581.08 --> 2581.76]  Verse 1
[2581.76 --> 2582.30]  The psalmist
[2582.30 --> 2583.08]  Looks at the
[2583.08 --> 2584.44]  Geography of Jerusalem
[2584.44 --> 2585.46]  And draws out
[2585.46 --> 2586.64]  A spiritual lesson
[2586.64 --> 2588.28]  For our relationship
[2588.28 --> 2588.80]  With God
[2588.80 --> 2589.20]  And he says
[2589.20 --> 2590.62]  Just as the mountains
[2590.62 --> 2591.66]  Surround Jerusalem
[2591.66 --> 2592.46]  So
[2592.46 --> 2593.72]  The Lord
[2593.72 --> 2595.34]  Surrounds his people
[2595.34 --> 2596.60]  Both now
[2596.60 --> 2597.18]  And forevermore
[2597.18 --> 2598.02]  He surrounds us
[2598.02 --> 2599.08]  We are fortified
[2599.08 --> 2599.98]  We are
[2599.98 --> 2601.14]  Protected
[2601.14 --> 2601.84]  We are strong
[2601.84 --> 2603.28]  And it gives me
[2603.28 --> 2604.04]  This image of this
[2604.04 --> 2605.18]  Little child
[2605.18 --> 2606.10]  Maybe being held
[2606.10 --> 2607.16]  And kept safe
[2607.16 --> 2608.08]  In the arms
[2608.08 --> 2609.48]  Of her strong mother
[2609.48 --> 2610.64]  Who loves her
[2610.64 --> 2611.38]  And protects her
[2611.38 --> 2614.44]  And God often
[2614.44 --> 2615.56]  Reveals himself
[2615.56 --> 2616.62]  In the Bible
[2616.62 --> 2617.70]  As a source
[2617.70 --> 2618.32]  Of refuge
[2618.32 --> 2618.84]  And protection
[2618.84 --> 2619.32]  Doesn't he
[2619.32 --> 2620.34]  I want to share
[2620.34 --> 2620.70]  A couple
[2620.70 --> 2621.22]  Psalms
[2621.22 --> 2622.48]  Excuse me
[2622.48 --> 2623.12]  Verses with you
[2623.12 --> 2623.74]  From the Psalms
[2623.74 --> 2626.08]  Psalm 46.1
[2626.08 --> 2627.78]  God
[2627.78 --> 2629.08]  Is our refuge
[2629.08 --> 2629.98]  And strength
[2629.98 --> 2631.52]  In ever present
[2631.52 --> 2632.20]  Help and trouble
[2632.20 --> 2635.52]  Psalm 18
[2635.52 --> 2636.08]  Verse 2
[2636.08 --> 2636.58]  Says
[2636.58 --> 2637.68]  The Lord
[2637.68 --> 2638.60]  Is my rock
[2638.60 --> 2639.82]  My fortress
[2639.82 --> 2641.36]  And my deliverer
[2641.36 --> 2642.12]  My God
[2642.12 --> 2642.94]  Is my rock
[2642.94 --> 2643.82]  In whom
[2643.82 --> 2644.84]  I take refuge
[2644.84 --> 2646.04]  My shield
[2646.04 --> 2646.92]  The horn
[2646.92 --> 2647.74]  Of my salvation
[2647.74 --> 2648.76]  My stronghold
[2648.76 --> 2650.60]  And then one more
[2650.60 --> 2652.20]  Psalm 34
[2652.20 --> 2653.48]  The angel
[2653.48 --> 2654.06]  Of the Lord
[2654.06 --> 2655.02]  En camps around
[2655.02 --> 2656.00]  Those who fear him
[2656.00 --> 2657.76]  And he delivers them
[2657.76 --> 2659.20]  Taste and see
[2659.20 --> 2659.70]  That the Lord
[2659.70 --> 2660.14]  Is good
[2660.14 --> 2661.74]  Blessed is the one
[2661.74 --> 2663.14]  Who takes refuge
[2663.14 --> 2664.24]  In him
[2664.24 --> 2666.68]  So the scriptures
[2666.68 --> 2668.06]  Over and over
[2668.06 --> 2669.08]  Affirm
[2669.08 --> 2670.10]  The Lord
[2670.10 --> 2671.18]  Surrounding
[2671.18 --> 2671.82]  And protecting
[2671.82 --> 2672.28]  Us
[2672.28 --> 2673.04]  Friends
[2673.04 --> 2674.20]  That is our
[2674.20 --> 2674.84]  Position
[2674.84 --> 2675.54]  Right
[2675.54 --> 2676.56]  You are
[2676.56 --> 2677.82]  In good hands
[2677.82 --> 2678.78]  That's what
[2678.78 --> 2679.08]  The Bible
[2679.08 --> 2681.04]  That's what the
[2681.04 --> 2682.04]  Bible promises us
[2682.04 --> 2682.40]  So that's what it
[2682.40 --> 2682.88]  Says here
[2682.88 --> 2683.74]  But I also think
[2683.74 --> 2684.22]  What is really
[2684.22 --> 2685.00]  Important about
[2685.00 --> 2685.70]  This psalm
[2685.70 --> 2686.88]  Is its honesty
[2686.88 --> 2687.84]  Right
[2687.84 --> 2688.28]  This psalm
[2688.28 --> 2688.96]  Doesn't naively
[2688.96 --> 2689.68]  Suggest that
[2689.68 --> 2690.20]  If you
[2690.20 --> 2691.44]  Know and follow
[2691.44 --> 2692.24]  The living God
[2692.24 --> 2692.74]  That you
[2692.74 --> 2693.50]  Suddenly are
[2693.50 --> 2694.38]  Immune from
[2694.38 --> 2694.98]  Trouble and
[2694.98 --> 2695.34]  Mayhem
[2695.34 --> 2695.92]  And that you
[2695.92 --> 2696.48]  Are kept safe
[2696.48 --> 2697.00]  From all the
[2697.00 --> 2698.00]  Difficulties and
[2698.00 --> 2698.52]  Troubles of the
[2698.52 --> 2698.80]  World
[2698.80 --> 2699.86]  Because
[2699.86 --> 2700.48]  Right
[2700.48 --> 2701.44]  In the next
[2701.44 --> 2701.78]  Verse
[2701.78 --> 2703.12]  It talks about
[2703.12 --> 2703.68]  The scepter
[2703.68 --> 2704.24]  Of the wicked
[2704.24 --> 2705.36]  The psalmist
[2705.36 --> 2706.14]  Reminds the
[2706.14 --> 2706.76]  Israelites
[2706.76 --> 2707.64]  Of the
[2707.64 --> 2708.08]  Scepter
[2708.08 --> 2709.64]  Of wickedness
[2709.64 --> 2710.20]  That is
[2710.20 --> 2711.22]  Over the
[2711.22 --> 2711.74]  Land
[2711.74 --> 2714.60]  The psalm
[2714.60 --> 2715.28]  Was likely
[2715.28 --> 2715.94]  Written
[2715.94 --> 2716.72]  In the
[2716.72 --> 2717.28]  Exilic
[2717.28 --> 2717.78]  Or post
[2717.78 --> 2718.36]  Exilic
[2718.36 --> 2718.70]  Period
[2718.70 --> 2719.36]  Which means
[2719.36 --> 2720.28]  That there's
[2720.28 --> 2720.76]  A very good
[2720.76 --> 2721.06]  Chance
[2721.06 --> 2721.36]  That this
[2721.36 --> 2721.52]  Psalm
[2721.52 --> 2721.96]  Was written
[2721.96 --> 2722.92]  In a time
[2722.92 --> 2723.66]  When Jerusalem
[2723.66 --> 2725.30]  Had been
[2725.30 --> 2725.80]  Sieged
[2725.80 --> 2726.62]  That the
[2726.62 --> 2727.12]  Mountains
[2727.12 --> 2727.92]  That surrounded
[2727.92 --> 2728.78]  It and protected
[2728.78 --> 2729.72]  It were
[2729.72 --> 2730.24]  Breached
[2730.24 --> 2731.06]  That the
[2731.06 --> 2731.42]  City
[2731.42 --> 2732.88]  Was overthrown
[2732.88 --> 2734.98]  And God's
[2734.98 --> 2735.58]  People had
[2735.58 --> 2736.16]  Been scattered
[2736.16 --> 2736.54]  And led
[2736.54 --> 2737.14]  Into exile
[2737.14 --> 2738.98]  So the
[2738.98 --> 2739.76]  Guy who
[2739.76 --> 2740.32]  Wrote the
[2740.32 --> 2740.78]  Psalm
[2740.78 --> 2742.14]  Is deeply
[2742.14 --> 2742.84]  Familiar
[2742.84 --> 2744.62]  With pain
[2744.62 --> 2745.16]  And suffering
[2745.16 --> 2747.42]  And so
[2747.42 --> 2747.78]  Are we
[2747.78 --> 2748.18]  Aren't we
[2748.18 --> 2748.92]  Right
[2748.92 --> 2749.32]  The truth
[2749.32 --> 2749.80]  Is friends
[2749.80 --> 2750.16]  That we
[2750.16 --> 2751.00]  Also face
[2751.00 --> 2752.06]  Real pain
[2752.06 --> 2752.60]  And suffering
[2752.60 --> 2753.16]  In life
[2753.16 --> 2754.84]  Many of
[2754.84 --> 2755.20]  You have
[2755.20 --> 2755.52]  Faced
[2755.52 --> 2755.92]  Terrible
[2755.92 --> 2756.56]  Losses
[2756.56 --> 2757.84]  You've
[2757.84 --> 2758.14]  Lost
[2758.14 --> 2758.48]  Really
[2758.48 --> 2758.84]  Important
[2758.84 --> 2759.24]  People
[2759.24 --> 2760.06]  Or things
[2760.06 --> 2761.58]  Even
[2761.58 --> 2761.62]  Even
[2761.62 --> 2761.86]  Very
[2761.86 --> 2762.28]  Recently
[2762.28 --> 2764.06]  And sometimes
[2764.06 --> 2764.88]  We have
[2764.88 --> 2765.96]  Unbearable
[2765.96 --> 2766.98]  Conflicts
[2766.98 --> 2767.38]  In our
[2767.38 --> 2767.92]  Marriages
[2767.92 --> 2768.58]  Or in our
[2768.58 --> 2769.08]  Families
[2769.08 --> 2770.80]  We face
[2770.80 --> 2771.46]  Oppression
[2771.46 --> 2772.28]  And injustice
[2772.28 --> 2773.76]  And poverty
[2773.76 --> 2775.28]  All around us
[2775.28 --> 2775.96]  In our communities
[2775.96 --> 2776.58]  In our nation
[2776.58 --> 2777.12]  In the world
[2777.12 --> 2777.92]  And so we can
[2777.92 --> 2778.66]  Sometimes lose
[2778.66 --> 2779.12]  Heart
[2779.12 --> 2780.76]  Over the
[2780.76 --> 2781.24]  Seeming
[2781.24 --> 2782.50]  Insurmountable
[2782.50 --> 2783.12]  Pain and
[2783.12 --> 2783.64]  Brokenness
[2783.64 --> 2784.44]  Of the world
[2784.44 --> 2784.92]  We can
[2784.92 --> 2784.94]  We can
[2784.94 --> 2785.38]  Just lose
[2785.38 --> 2785.64]  Heart
[2785.64 --> 2787.58]  And all
[2787.58 --> 2787.86]  Of this
[2787.86 --> 2788.50]  Can produce
[2788.50 --> 2789.06]  Some really
[2789.06 --> 2789.82]  Hard
[2789.82 --> 2790.58]  Questions
[2790.58 --> 2791.46]  In us
[2791.46 --> 2792.26]  Like
[2792.26 --> 2793.22]  Why is
[2793.22 --> 2793.44]  God
[2793.44 --> 2793.86]  Allowing
[2793.86 --> 2794.28]  This
[2794.28 --> 2795.50]  Are we
[2795.50 --> 2796.12]  Really
[2796.12 --> 2796.94]  In good
[2796.94 --> 2797.40]  Hands
[2797.40 --> 2798.82]  And the
[2798.82 --> 2799.16]  Psalmist
[2799.16 --> 2799.52]  Is honest
[2799.52 --> 2800.10]  About this
[2800.10 --> 2800.70]  He is
[2800.70 --> 2801.02]  Writing
[2801.02 --> 2801.56]  This
[2801.56 --> 2803.34]  Likely
[2803.34 --> 2804.84]  As I've
[2804.84 --> 2805.10]  Said
[2805.10 --> 2805.86]  When Jerusalem
[2805.86 --> 2806.76]  Has already
[2806.76 --> 2808.18]  Fallen
[2808.18 --> 2809.92]  And yet
[2809.92 --> 2810.66]  Even in the
[2810.66 --> 2811.06]  Face of
[2811.06 --> 2811.36]  That
[2811.36 --> 2812.60]  This is
[2812.60 --> 2812.80]  What he
[2812.80 --> 2813.00]  Says
[2813.00 --> 2813.34]  In verse
[2813.34 --> 2813.64]  Three
[2813.64 --> 2814.62]  Let's
[2814.62 --> 2814.84]  Put it
[2814.84 --> 2815.20]  Up here
[2815.20 --> 2816.32]  The
[2816.32 --> 2816.62]  Scepter
[2816.62 --> 2816.84]  Of the
[2816.84 --> 2817.52]  Wickedness
[2817.52 --> 2819.14]  Will not
[2819.14 --> 2820.02]  Remain
[2820.02 --> 2820.94]  Over the
[2820.94 --> 2821.26]  Land
[2821.26 --> 2821.62]  Allotted
[2821.62 --> 2821.92]  To the
[2821.92 --> 2822.34]  Righteous
[2822.34 --> 2822.92]  Do you
[2822.92 --> 2823.14]  See what
[2823.14 --> 2823.26]  He's
[2823.26 --> 2823.44]  Saying
[2823.44 --> 2823.66]  There
[2823.66 --> 2824.42]  The
[2824.42 --> 2824.74]  Scepter
[2824.74 --> 2825.12]  Of the
[2825.12 --> 2825.40]  Wicked
[2825.40 --> 2826.16]  Will not
[2826.16 --> 2826.68]  Remain
[2826.68 --> 2828.28]  He's
[2828.28 --> 2828.42]  Saying
[2828.42 --> 2828.94]  As much
[2828.94 --> 2829.48]  As it
[2829.48 --> 2829.96]  Looks
[2829.96 --> 2830.30]  Like
[2830.30 --> 2830.54]  That
[2830.54 --> 2831.18]  Wickedness
[2831.18 --> 2831.96]  Is winning
[2831.96 --> 2832.24]  Right
[2832.24 --> 2832.56]  Now
[2832.56 --> 2834.52]  The
[2834.52 --> 2835.08]  Days
[2835.08 --> 2835.48]  Of the
[2835.48 --> 2835.76]  Wicked
[2835.76 --> 2836.10]  Are
[2836.10 --> 2837.04]  Numbered
[2837.04 --> 2837.44]  Right
[2837.44 --> 2837.70]  Their
[2837.70 --> 2838.36]  Rule
[2838.36 --> 2839.80]  Will not
[2839.80 --> 2840.34]  Last
[2840.34 --> 2841.20]  God's
[2841.20 --> 2841.60]  Purposes
[2841.60 --> 2842.20]  For the
[2842.20 --> 2842.42]  World
[2842.42 --> 2843.18]  Ultimately
[2843.18 --> 2844.06]  Will
[2844.06 --> 2844.62]  In the
[2844.62 --> 2844.88]  End
[2844.88 --> 2845.64]  Prevail
[2845.64 --> 2847.64]  So
[2847.64 --> 2847.86]  Many
[2847.86 --> 2848.18]  Of us
[2848.18 --> 2848.32]  Have
[2848.32 --> 2848.62]  Recently
[2848.62 --> 2849.10]  Watched

[2854.46 --> 2855.04]  Heard

[2861.60 --> 2862.22]  Which
[2862.22 --> 2862.38]  Was

[2872.22 --> 2872.42]  Looked
[2872.42 --> 2872.58]  Up
[2872.58 --> 2872.98]  Online

[2876.38 --> 2876.92]  Tell
[2876.92 --> 2877.00]  You
[2877.00 --> 2877.10]  The

[2877.26 --> 2877.56]  First
[2877.56 --> 2877.88]  Actually
[2877.88 --> 2878.60]  So
[2878.60 --> 2879.06]  Stephen
[2879.06 --> 2879.54]  Was

[2882.04 --> 2882.18]  Was
[2882.18 --> 2882.28]  In

[2888.46 --> 2888.86]  The
[2888.86 --> 2889.70]  Underdog
[2889.70 --> 2890.02]  Of
[2890.02 --> 2890.64]  Underdogs
[2890.64 --> 2891.12]  He

[2967.58 --> 2967.76]  He
[2967.76 --> 2968.08]  Won
[2968.08 --> 2968.40]  Not

[2968.78 --> 2969.00]  He's
[2969.00 --> 2969.12]  The
[2969.12 --> 2969.72]  Fastest
[2969.72 --> 2970.94]  But
[2970.94 --> 2971.18]  Why
[2971.18 --> 2971.52]  Because
[2971.52 --> 2971.66]  He's
[2971.66 --> 2971.78]  The

[2975.10 --> 2975.24]  What
[2975.24 --> 2975.34]  I

[2975.54 --> 2975.66]  To
[2975.66 --> 2976.78]  Say
[2976.78 --> 2977.54]  Sometimes
[2977.54 --> 2977.84]  It
[2977.84 --> 2978.10]  Looks
[2978.10 --> 2978.40]  Like
[2978.40 --> 2978.80]  Evil
[2978.80 --> 2979.06]  And
[2979.06 --> 2979.36]  Sin
[2979.36 --> 2979.52]  And
[2979.52 --> 2980.02]  Wickedness
[2980.02 --> 2980.12]  And
[2980.12 --> 2980.20]  The
[2980.20 --> 2980.62]  Brokenness
[2980.62 --> 2980.72]  Of
[2980.72 --> 2980.82]  The

[2984.26 --> 2984.40]  It
[2984.40 --> 2984.70]  Looks
[2984.70 --> 2985.04]  Like
[2985.04 --> 2985.28]  They
[2985.28 --> 2985.58]  Will
[2985.58 --> 2985.94]  Win
[2985.94 --> 2987.02]  It
[2987.02 --> 2987.22]  Looks

[3831.48 --> 3831.54]  Of
[3831.54 --> 3832.48]  Half
[3832.48 --> 3832.66]  Until

[3834.06 --> 3836.56]  Bye
[3836.56 --> 3843.68]  them
[3856.14 --> 3858.68]  is
[3866.56 --> 3879.40]  The body will be healed, God's truth forever still.
[3879.40 --> 3886.92]  His kingdom is forever true.
[3896.56 --> 3904.20]  Please be seated.
[3904.20 --> 3909.56]  So we come now to our community prayer and our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church,
[3909.56 --> 3915.26]  has designated this Sunday as what they call a day of justice.
[3915.26 --> 3919.38]  The idea behind this is simply to give us an opportunity to reflect on the biblical theme
[3919.38 --> 3922.36]  of justice and what it means for our lives.
[3922.36 --> 3928.18]  We do that with our other brother and sister churches, sister churches I guess we just
[3928.18 --> 3933.82]  say, in the denomination.
[3933.82 --> 3938.34]  As Christians we are called to a lifetime of justice and righteousness.
[3938.34 --> 3944.52]  We see that throughout the Bible and we know that scripture promises us a future of renewal
[3944.52 --> 3949.28]  and restoration, which is a writing of all of our broken relationships, a relationship
[3949.28 --> 3953.84]  with God, ourselves, others in the world.
[3953.84 --> 3961.88]  And we recognize that Jesus calls us, even now, to stand up and be workers for his kingdom,
[3961.88 --> 3969.10]  to begin that renewal by the Spirit's work here and now, where we are in our own context,
[3969.10 --> 3971.10]  in the time and place that God has put us.
[3971.10 --> 3977.32]  And so, would you please join me in prayer for God's justice to roll down like mighty waters
[3977.32 --> 3978.66]  upon our world.
[3978.66 --> 3985.98]  And so, throughout the prayer, I will say, Lord in your mercy, and then we can all say
[3985.98 --> 3987.80]  together, hear our prayer.
[3987.80 --> 3990.40]  Okay, Lord in our mercy, hear our prayer.
[3990.40 --> 3995.54]  And we will also especially pray for Janet this morning, as she grieves the passing of
[3995.54 --> 4001.66]  John into the glorious reality of being face to face with God, his creator and heavenly
[4001.66 --> 4002.04]  father.
[4003.04 --> 4003.74]  So let's pray.
[4006.30 --> 4012.76]  Father, we come before you this morning in humble reliance on you and your grace for us.
[4013.76 --> 4017.26]  We praise you that you delight in hearing from your children.
[4017.26 --> 4025.06]  And what a gift it is that we can come before you to share our hearts, our praises and our
[4025.06 --> 4028.42]  joys, also our fears and our requests.
[4029.36 --> 4037.18]  Thank you that through Jesus' life, death and resurrection, we have full access to the
[4037.18 --> 4039.80]  heavenly temple, the throne room of God.
[4041.20 --> 4043.92]  So first, Lord, this morning we lift up our sister Janet.
[4043.92 --> 4050.58]  We pray that you would comfort her in this time of tremendous grief and sadness.
[4051.72 --> 4055.18]  Lord, we thank you for the promise that you do hold us secure.
[4055.28 --> 4056.76]  Would you hold Janet secure now?
[4059.40 --> 4065.12]  And also, Lord, we pray, Lord, that you would hear us this morning as we specifically pray
[4065.12 --> 4066.78]  for justice in our world.
[4068.12 --> 4070.58]  Look on us and answer us, Lord our God.
[4070.68 --> 4072.14]  Give light to our eyes.
[4072.14 --> 4076.32]  We pray for those who suffer with illness and pain.
[4077.10 --> 4083.78]  We especially pray for all those facing COVID-19, especially the death of hundreds of children
[4083.78 --> 4084.56]  in Indonesia.
[4086.34 --> 4088.80]  Lord, bring comfort and cures.
[4089.66 --> 4092.56]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4094.12 --> 4098.52]  We pray for brothers and sisters living in places of war and terror.
[4099.70 --> 4101.00]  Lord, would you bring peace?
[4101.00 --> 4106.96]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4108.96 --> 4118.86]  Father, we pray for justice, for equity, that the voices of all people might be heard because
[4118.86 --> 4122.72]  you have created us with dignity in your image.
[4122.72 --> 4128.68]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4128.68 --> 4137.52]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4139.06 --> 4141.64]  We pray for families living in hardship.
[4141.64 --> 4149.30]  Lord, in your mercy, that the broken relationships might be mended and hurtful paths be resolved.
[4153.30 --> 4156.58]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4156.58 --> 4158.46]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4158.46 --> 4166.46]  We pray for the disaster and turmoil in our world, for countries and people ravaged by poverty and death.
[4167.54 --> 4177.44]  We pray for governments and nations for stability of rule, that they would rule in your name and according to truth.
[4177.44 --> 4177.52]  We pray for the truth.
[4178.40 --> 4187.28]  We pray that with good rule that you provide, Lord, that people everywhere would flourish in the life that you created us to live.
[4187.28 --> 4190.24]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4190.24 --> 4190.32]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4190.88 --> 4197.54]  We pray for your church, that barriers might be broken, for your gospel to go forth.
[4198.40 --> 4204.72]  We pray that unity and truth might prevail against schism and heresy.
[4205.84 --> 4208.62]  Embrace us, Lord, to be witnesses in your world.
[4210.24 --> 4212.96]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4212.96 --> 4217.76]  And as we pray for our broken world, Lord, we ask how long?
[4218.40 --> 4221.94]  How long, O Lord, until you return to renew all things?
[4223.06 --> 4232.50]  Help us to wait in patience and hope and expectation, but not to wait as passive bystanders.
[4233.10 --> 4239.82]  Rather, transform us into alert and active children of God who seek justice.
[4239.82 --> 4251.08]  Show us where and how you are at work in our world so that we can join you in what you are already doing ahead of us, despite us, for us.
[4251.56 --> 4261.40]  Open our eyes to see who you are so we catch your spirit and see others who are for who you created them to be.
[4262.20 --> 4267.30]  So, Father, we commit once again this morning to trusting in you.
[4267.30 --> 4270.02]  We trust in your unfailing love.
[4270.54 --> 4272.62]  Our hearts rejoice in your salvation.
[4273.04 --> 4276.04]  We will sing the Lord's praise, for he has been good to us.
[4276.44 --> 4280.26]  We will rejoice in the Lord and be joyful in God, our Savior.
[4281.00 --> 4285.34]  And all God's children together say, Amen.
[4285.34 --> 4296.92]  I invite you to finally stand once again and to hear these words of blessing, these good words of benediction over you.
[4297.46 --> 4302.34]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the blessing of God.
[4302.34 --> 4312.06]  To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4312.48 --> 4322.16]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages and now and forevermore.
[4323.00 --> 4323.32]  Amen.
[4323.32 --> 4331.24]  And let's sing our final song as we go forth with God's blessings and to live for his purposes.
[4331.24 --> 4331.60]  Amen.
