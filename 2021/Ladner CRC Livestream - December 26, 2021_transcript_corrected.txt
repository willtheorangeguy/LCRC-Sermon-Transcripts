[413.32 → 416.46] Now, please rise for God's greeting.
[420.66 → 430.36] The greeting today is taken from the parable of the talents, and it's a greeting that we all look forward to in the end time.

[1240.16 → 1270.14] Thank you.
[1270.16 → 1300.14] Thank you.
[1300.16 → 1330.14] Thank you.
[1330.14 → 1360.12] Thank you.
[1360.14 → 1390.12] Thank you.
[1390.12 → 1420.10] Thank you.
[1420.12 → 1450.10] Thank you.
[1450.10 → 1480.10] Thank you.
[1480.10 → 1510.08] Thank you.
[1510.08 → 1540.06] Thank you.
[1540.06 → 1570.06] Thank you.
[1570.06 → 1600.06] Thank you.
[1600.06 → 1630.04] Thank you.
[1630.04 → 1660.04] Thank you.
[1660.04 → 1690.04] Thank you.
[1690.04 → 1720.04] Thank you.
[1720.04 → 1750.04] Thank you.
[1750.04 → 1780.04] Thank you.
[1780.04 → 1810.04] Thank you.
[1810.04 → 1840.02] Thank you.
[1840.04 → 1870.04] Thank you.
[1870.04 → 1877.42] difficult to talk about. We find it distasteful, and it becomes, therefore, easy to avoid it,
[1877.60 → 1883.72] to ignore it. But just like the people in the 1930s encountering the wolves of Yellowstone,
[1883.80 → 1889.16] we think the best thing to do with these unpleasant doctrines is just to kill them off,
[1889.72 → 1896.58] right? We think maybe Christianity would be better without them. But friends, what we need
[1896.58 → 1902.66] to understand is that there's actually kind of this ecological balance, so to speak,
[1903.46 → 1912.82] in the scriptures. So when we avoid or neglect one doctrine, what happened is just like
[1912.82 → 1918.18] what happened in Yellowstone. It tends to bring about these counterintuitive consequences,
[1918.70 → 1925.24] and we find ourselves damaging a doctrine that we might actually like. In this case,
[1925.24 → 1930.72] if we downplay or ignore or repudiate the doctrine of the final judgment to come,
[1930.94 → 1936.82] we will find that we have actually downplayed, ignored, or repudiated the doctrines of God's grace
[1936.82 → 1943.50] and of his love. So just like the gray wolf, when it comes to the final judgment, we may not find it
[1943.50 → 1951.82] pleasant, but it is essential. And the final judgment is essential in the ecosystem of God's
[1951.82 → 1961.08] redeeming love for us in the world. So as we're thinking about the second advent, when Jesus returns,
[1961.20 → 1966.76] this is one of the key aspects of that. One of the key things that we as Christians need to realize
[1966.76 → 1972.10] is that, and how this final judgment works. So today I want to approach this passage kind of in three parts,
[1973.08 → 1980.28] looking as we follow the flow of the text. Judgment now, then judgment to come. And then the thirdly,
[1980.28 → 1983.88] I just want to talk about what are some implications for that for how we live today.
[1985.02 → 1992.34] So first, Paul opens the letter, judgment now, Paul opens the letter with this prayer of thanksgiving
[1992.34 → 2000.08] for the Thessalonians' continued faithfulness and love, and especially for their endurance.
[2001.46 → 2005.28] But Paul also mentions that they have this faith, they have this love,
[2005.28 → 2012.78] they have this endurance even as they are suffering many trials and persecutions.
[2013.82 → 2023.72] So Paul has learned that the Greek, the Roman, and maybe even their Jewish neighbours have actually
[2023.72 → 2032.38] intensified their persecution of these Christians. And Paul is worried that these new Thessalonian
[2032.38 → 2039.04] Christians who, you know, he travelled to Thessalonica, he spread the gospel, people were coming to faith,
[2039.10 → 2042.50] but these are newborn Christians. They don't, they're the first generation of Christians.
[2042.96 → 2049.68] They don't have a lot of older, you know, generations to learn what does it mean to live the Christian life.
[2050.50 → 2056.28] So it's this young, new believers, they're being persecuted for their faith, and Paul is worried
[2056.28 → 2063.54] that they might give up on Jesus if it gets any worse. So Paul writes the second letter of Thessalonians
[2063.54 → 2069.56] to encourage them. And here's what he writes beginning in verse 4. We'll have it up here on the screen.
[2071.34 → 2073.28] Beginning in verse 4, Paul says,
[2073.28 → 2079.92] Therefore, among God's churches, we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and
[2079.92 → 2087.38] trials you are enduring. Imagine that. Paul's going around boasting about the Thessalonians to these
[2087.38 → 2092.04] other churches. He's like, have you guys noticed those Thessalonians? They're just, they're just
[2092.04 → 2099.22] growing like crazy. They're awesome. He says, all of this is evidence that God's judgment is right.
[2099.76 → 2104.62] And as a result, you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are suffering.
[2104.62 → 2111.98] So Paul's saying that there is a judgment that is actually happening right now in the present.
[2112.84 → 2121.04] And what is the evidence that God's judgment is right? He says it is both their suffering itself
[2121.04 → 2127.96] and it is their faith and hope and love and perseverance even in the midst of that suffering.
[2127.96 → 2131.64] So in other words, Paul reminds them
[2131.64 → 2136.10] that their suffering because they are following Jesus,
[2136.94 → 2139.96] the persecution that they're experiencing because
[2139.96 → 2143.30] they are associated with Jesus
[2143.30 → 2145.52] is
[2145.52 → 2149.54] evidence of the righteous judgment of God.
[2150.72 → 2154.24] And that's a little bit counterintuitive to us, but what it means is that
[2154.24 → 2158.02] because God is granting them the grace to endure,
[2158.66 → 2163.22] he is clearly on their side. He is clearly at work among them.
[2164.70 → 2169.88] And this is actually very similar to what Peter says in 1 Peter.
[2170.46 → 2175.04] He says, for it is the time for judgment to begin with God's household.
[2176.26 → 2178.40] Okay, let me say that again. This is what 1 Peter writes.
[2178.40 → 2184.06] For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household.
[2185.12 → 2189.84] And if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[2191.12 → 2196.22] So what this means is that for Christians to bear suffering patiently,
[2196.82 → 2203.14] it's a kind of proof that the gospel is true and that God is who he says he is.
[2203.14 → 2209.34] You know, and both Jesus and Paul teach that suffering is the path to glory.
[2210.68 → 2213.60] And we don't like to hear that, do we?
[2214.44 → 2216.82] Right? We don't like to read that at all.
[2217.76 → 2220.06] But this is what John says.
[2221.04 → 2222.64] This is what Jesus says in John 16.
[2223.14 → 2224.16] Jesus says to us,
[2224.16 → 2241.40] And in Acts chapter 14,
[2241.62 → 2244.12] Paul and Barnabas are out there preaching the gospel.
[2244.78 → 2246.72] They have won many disciples.
[2247.66 → 2249.70] Then they are strengthening the disciples.
[2249.88 → 2252.24] They are encouraging them to remain true to the faith.
[2252.24 → 2254.14] And they say,
[2254.52 → 2258.00] We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.
[2259.40 → 2262.72] And so the suffering of the Thessalonians was evidence.
[2263.24 → 2267.02] It was kind of like a signpost that they were on the right road.
[2268.22 → 2272.26] And so have you ever been hiking, you know, on the trails,
[2272.52 → 2275.02] maybe here on the North Shore?
[2275.72 → 2279.50] And you're hiking, and as you're on a trail, you look for those markers, right?
[2279.50 → 2283.46] You look for those signs, those blazes that are on trees and rocks.
[2283.50 → 2285.92] And they tell you that you are on the right trail.
[2286.98 → 2289.34] And sometimes you can be going for a way,
[2289.86 → 2292.66] and maybe you haven't seen a trail marker in a while.
[2294.00 → 2297.00] And so you get a little bit worried that you're lost.
[2297.72 → 2299.40] And maybe you're going in the wrong direction.
[2299.52 → 2301.16] Maybe you're not where you're supposed to be.
[2301.16 → 2305.02] But finally, you're kind of going along, feeling confused and lost.
[2305.06 → 2307.82] And finally, you see the trail marker again.
[2308.32 → 2310.64] And even though you're tired, and you're worn out,
[2310.94 → 2312.58] and you want to get to your destination,
[2312.76 → 2313.14] you're like,
[2313.64 → 2314.32] Yes, good.
[2315.36 → 2317.48] At least I know where I am.
[2317.52 → 2319.42] At least I know I'm on the right path.
[2320.66 → 2324.08] And it's a very kind of paradoxical way like that,
[2324.54 → 2326.44] that that is what suffering is in our lives.
[2326.44 → 2333.68] Their ability to endure and thrive through persecution,
[2334.42 → 2335.64] for the Thessalonians,
[2335.72 → 2338.80] it was a sign that God was at work in their lives.
[2339.42 → 2341.86] That they were on the right path.
[2341.94 → 2345.86] That they were participating in the kingdom of God.
[2346.88 → 2349.12] That they're following Jesus faithfully.
[2349.58 → 2354.48] The king who himself patiently endured suffering on the cross.
[2354.48 → 2361.54] So, this is the judgment that they, the Christians, experience,
[2361.68 → 2364.58] and that we will experience as well in this present age.
[2365.02 → 2368.16] That as we endure suffering, that God's judgment upon us,
[2368.42 → 2371.52] it's like a stamp that he is at work.
[2371.64 → 2373.16] That we belong to him.
[2374.56 → 2376.24] And that we are on the right path.
[2377.84 → 2379.64] But here's the second thing we see here.
[2379.78 → 2381.56] Not only is there judgment in the present,
[2382.52 → 2384.42] and it starts with the church,
[2385.00 → 2385.84] the people of God,
[2385.92 → 2387.42] but there's also judgment in the future.
[2389.34 → 2393.22] So, let's look at the next couple verses in our passage.
[2393.32 → 2395.34] Verses 6 and 7, this is what it says.
[2396.34 → 2397.40] God is just.
[2398.76 → 2401.10] He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you,
[2401.60 → 2404.04] and give relief to you who are troubled,
[2404.50 → 2405.50] and to us as well.
[2405.78 → 2408.56] Paul and his colleagues were also suffering,
[2408.80 → 2410.80] along with the Thessalonians.
[2410.80 → 2417.66] This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire
[2417.66 → 2419.78] with his powerful angels.
[2420.90 → 2423.60] So, the righteous judgment of God is seen,
[2423.82 → 2427.74] not only as Christians endure persecution with faith and love and endurance,
[2427.74 → 2433.18] but also as the tables are turned on the day of judgment.
[2434.12 → 2439.04] Jesus will be revealed in that day as the Lion of Judah.
[2439.84 → 2441.76] He's often revealed as the Lamb,
[2442.50 → 2443.52] the suffering Lamb,
[2443.60 → 2446.70] but on that day he will be revealed as the Lion.
[2446.70 → 2453.08] Those who are suffering will find complete and perfect relief,
[2453.76 → 2458.52] and the oppressors who are causing the suffering on these Christians,
[2458.88 → 2462.06] they will suffer unimaginably, it says.
[2463.18 → 2465.66] So, Paul in this passage, he teaches very clearly,
[2466.30 → 2469.28] not only a glorious and bright future for the people of God,
[2469.28 → 2474.10] but a dark and destructive future for those who don't believe.
[2475.36 → 2476.78] And so, as we look at this passage,
[2476.88 → 2480.22] what exactly do we learn about the nature of the final judgment here?
[2480.56 → 2482.52] So, Paul brings up just a couple of things.
[2483.26 → 2486.30] First, he says that the punishment to come is just.
[2487.18 → 2488.24] God is just.
[2489.06 → 2490.18] That's what it says in verse 6.
[2490.32 → 2491.04] God is just.
[2491.14 → 2494.20] He will pay back trouble to those who are troubling you.
[2494.20 → 2500.08] Which means that in whatever happens,
[2500.82 → 2503.24] God is not capricious.
[2503.80 → 2505.30] God is not vindictive.
[2505.70 → 2506.88] You know, for us, sometimes,
[2507.24 → 2510.46] at times, you know, we can get very angry.
[2510.64 → 2512.22] We can kind of fly off the handle.
[2512.90 → 2515.24] Maybe go further than we meant to.
[2516.58 → 2520.28] But any punishment that God gives
[2520.28 → 2523.76] will be precisely what is demanded by the offence.
[2525.20 → 2527.90] And were God to allow those who are persecuting
[2527.90 → 2530.12] the Thessalonian church to escape punishment,
[2530.68 → 2532.26] that would be unjust.
[2533.58 → 2537.72] So, he's saying here, look, our sins demand justice.
[2538.00 → 2539.78] That there is a penalty for such things.
[2540.48 → 2544.30] And God's justice is fully right and fully good.
[2545.98 → 2549.38] So, Paul says, in the end, people will be sad.
[2549.38 → 2553.00] But there will not be a miscarriage of justice.
[2554.52 → 2556.82] Second, Paul says the punishment to come
[2556.82 → 2557.98] is mostly in the future.
[2558.84 → 2560.20] If you look at verse 7 there,
[2560.86 → 2563.86] Paul refers to the punishment that is coming.
[2564.70 → 2566.46] He says this will happen when
[2566.46 → 2569.56] the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven
[2569.56 → 2572.34] and blazing fire with his powerful angels.
[2573.90 → 2576.68] So, friends, we do in this life now today
[2576.68 → 2578.56] suffer temporal punishments.
[2578.70 → 2578.84] Right?
[2578.84 → 2580.06] If you speed, what happens?
[2580.84 → 2581.92] You get away with it.
[2582.66 → 2583.04] No, just kidding.
[2583.52 → 2583.88] Usually.
[2584.32 → 2585.98] But sometimes you might get a ticket.
[2587.10 → 2588.72] But Paul is saying here that the fullness
[2588.72 → 2590.90] of God's justice will be felt
[2590.90 → 2593.60] at the final judgment of all things.
[2594.30 → 2596.56] At the revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2596.96 → 2597.08] Right?
[2597.14 → 2600.12] And today we see so much injustice all around us.
[2601.42 → 2604.20] We see people speeding and not getting a ticket.
[2604.20 → 2607.08] You know, we see churches around the world
[2607.08 → 2608.22] being persecuted.
[2609.66 → 2611.70] We see ecological destruction.
[2611.82 → 2613.20] We see all of these injustices.
[2613.20 → 2616.30] And we say, in the face of those injustices,
[2616.42 → 2617.08] where is God?
[2618.22 → 2619.70] What can make things right?
[2619.90 → 2623.36] What can restore goodness, balance,
[2623.52 → 2624.78] and righteousness to the world?
[2625.00 → 2626.28] And that will happen, friends.
[2626.66 → 2629.92] In the end, justice will be fully,
[2631.14 → 2635.24] justly, righteously meted out for all people.
[2635.24 → 2643.46] So third, Paul tells us that the judgment to come
[2643.46 → 2647.58] is eternal separation from the presence of God
[2647.58 → 2650.90] for those who do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2651.64 → 2653.18] Verses 8 and 9 say this.
[2655.08 → 2657.62] He will punish those who do not know God
[2657.62 → 2659.70] and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[2660.50 → 2662.70] They will be punished with everlasting destruction
[2662.70 → 2665.34] and shut out from the presence of the Lord
[2665.34 → 2667.46] and from the glory of his might.
[2670.62 → 2671.94] Think about it like this.
[2672.88 → 2675.06] At tremendous cost,
[2676.20 → 2678.52] God made the gift of salvation possible.
[2679.86 → 2683.88] And if you refuse what Christ has done for you,
[2684.70 → 2688.22] there isn't anything left for you.
[2688.22 → 2691.16] If you refuse that,
[2691.44 → 2694.26] you are trampling the gift of God underfoot.
[2695.38 → 2698.16] And just like there are temporal consequences,
[2698.32 → 2699.00] like in this life,
[2699.10 → 2702.94] for offences against God and the law and others,
[2703.66 → 2706.52] there are spiritual consequences as well.
[2707.84 → 2711.10] And the spiritual consequence that Paul writes about here
[2711.10 → 2714.96] says that refusing the salvation that God provides,
[2714.96 → 2717.76] unbelievers will, in the end,
[2718.48 → 2720.18] be shut out from the presence of God.
[2722.22 → 2723.86] Just think about that for a minute.
[2724.30 → 2725.86] I mean, you can't think about it very long
[2725.86 → 2728.42] because your mind will kind of short circuit
[2728.42 → 2729.50] with the horror of it.
[2731.18 → 2736.08] But God is the source of everything good.
[2737.20 → 2738.98] He is the source of love.
[2740.16 → 2742.70] God is the source of beauty.
[2742.70 → 2744.74] He is the source of justice.
[2745.62 → 2747.34] He is the source of music,
[2747.98 → 2751.14] of light, of life.
[2752.02 → 2754.36] The joy and beauty that you and I get
[2754.36 → 2755.56] from looking at the ocean,
[2756.76 → 2758.56] from hearing great music,
[2759.16 → 2760.88] from being in someone's arms,
[2760.92 → 2764.06] it all comes from the presence of God.
[2764.34 → 2767.70] God is the source of all life and goodness in the world.
[2768.82 → 2770.58] We enjoy all of these things
[2770.58 → 2772.12] because of the presence of God.
[2773.60 → 2776.24] God has not yet withdrawn his presence.
[2777.14 → 2780.38] For those who are even now turned away from God,
[2780.62 → 2784.22] they are still benefiting from the presence of God in this world.
[2785.08 → 2786.44] They're still in his presence
[2786.44 → 2789.78] even as they have their back turned away from him.
[2790.38 → 2791.32] He's still here.
[2792.36 → 2795.20] They're still receiving common grace.
[2795.20 → 2798.22] All the things that we enjoy in this life.
[2799.62 → 2802.64] But that will be gone at judgment day.
[2803.46 → 2805.18] God will finally turn his back.
[2805.54 → 2808.94] He will finally withdraw his presence from those who reject him.
[2808.94 → 2814.84] And those who do not know God will be excluded from everything good.
[2814.84 → 2819.58] All the parts of God's presence that we now enjoy,
[2820.32 → 2822.94] light and life and goodness,
[2823.30 → 2827.26] will be extinguished from their experience.
[2827.26 → 2830.68] And all that is left is sadness,
[2831.22 → 2832.30] destruction and pain.
[2833.26 → 2836.08] The future for the non-Christian is utter ruin.
[2836.08 → 2838.92] This is the afterlife, Paul says.
[2839.04 → 2840.74] It's a just punishment.
[2841.40 → 2842.54] It's a future punishment.
[2842.82 → 2844.96] God is patient, not wanting any to perish.
[2844.96 → 2848.92] But in the end,
[2849.14 → 2850.88] the time will run out.
[2852.80 → 2853.64] And in the end,
[2853.76 → 2857.00] those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord,
[2857.08 → 2859.88] who do not just receive what Christ has done for them,
[2860.74 → 2863.88] they will be banished from the face of God.
[2865.62 → 2867.76] That's what the final judgment is about.
[2869.40 → 2871.62] So lastly, how are we to live?
[2871.62 → 2877.20] How are we to live now in light of this future day of judgment?
[2878.14 → 2881.40] I think there are two applications we can make here.
[2882.88 → 2885.72] The first is the reality of the final judgment
[2885.72 → 2887.70] should make us serious about our sin
[2887.70 → 2889.56] and our self-centredness now.
[2890.96 → 2893.46] See, friends, we're not talking today
[2893.46 → 2897.62] about God giving some crazy, over-the-top punishment
[2897.62 → 2901.00] for those of us who just have a few speeding tickets.
[2902.24 → 2904.32] Some people have this image of God,
[2904.66 → 2907.74] this cartoon image of him casting people into hell
[2907.74 → 2909.86] and they're like, you know, crying out,
[2909.90 → 2912.02] I'm sorry, you know, let me out.
[2913.32 → 2917.44] Friends, that is not at all what the Bible portrays.
[2918.46 → 2922.78] What this passage says is that God is allowing us,
[2923.24 → 2926.16] he's permitting us, if we reject him,
[2926.72 → 2929.04] to go the way we want.
[2929.04 → 2931.44] Right back in the Garden of Eden,
[2932.08 → 2933.60] God created man and woman.
[2933.72 → 2935.48] He created us to live face-to-face,
[2935.62 → 2937.28] quorum Do, before the face of God,
[2937.82 → 2940.46] where we experienced his love and presence.
[2941.12 → 2944.92] But what happened was we rejected God's ways,
[2945.00 → 2946.36] we decided to go our own way.
[2946.50 → 2947.88] We were cast out of his presence.
[2947.88 → 2955.78] And God is saying that if we continue down that road
[2955.78 → 2957.38] of just self-centredness,
[2957.74 → 2960.70] living in God's world with no regard to God,
[2960.82 → 2962.24] rejecting his grace,
[2962.68 → 2964.60] his wooing us and coming after us
[2964.60 → 2965.72] to restore us to himself,
[2965.78 → 2967.44] if we continue to reject that,
[2968.50 → 2970.50] God is going to give us what we want.
[2970.50 → 2973.68] As Romans 1.23 says,
[2973.78 → 2976.90] God gave them up to their desires.
[2977.70 → 2979.76] All God does in the end with people
[2979.76 → 2981.64] is give them what they most want,
[2981.72 → 2984.20] including freedom from himself.
[2985.66 → 2987.70] In his book, The Great Divorce,
[2988.18 → 2989.72] C.S. Lewis says this.
[2989.88 → 2990.64] I'll put the quote here.
[2991.64 → 2992.20] He says,
[2992.20 → 2993.78] There are only two kinds of people.
[2994.96 → 2995.80] Those who say,
[2996.46 → 2998.06] Thy will be done to God,
[2998.66 → 3001.06] or those to whom God in the end says,
[3001.90 → 3002.72] Thy will be done.
[3003.80 → 3006.42] All that are in hell, choose it.
[3007.18 → 3009.18] Without that self-choice, it wouldn't be hell.
[3009.56 → 3012.34] No one that seriously and constantly desires joy
[3012.34 → 3014.62] will ever miss it.
[3015.62 → 3016.36] And that means
[3016.36 → 3021.00] that there is eternity at stake
[3021.00 → 3023.64] in my life and in your life.
[3024.50 → 3026.14] There is life with God
[3026.14 → 3028.64] now and into eternity,
[3028.64 → 3031.02] and there is life without God now
[3031.02 → 3032.68] extending into eternity.
[3033.52 → 3035.28] So what does that mean for us today?
[3035.98 → 3037.90] Don't put it off, right?
[3038.82 → 3040.82] If you hear God's voice,
[3041.52 → 3042.64] you can come to him.
[3042.64 → 3046.92] You can always turn around toward him.
[3047.02 → 3048.56] He is waiting for you.
[3048.66 → 3049.86] He is loving you.
[3049.86 → 3051.38] He is wooing you to himself.
[3051.92 → 3053.32] And it doesn't matter who you are.
[3053.40 → 3054.70] It doesn't matter what you've done.
[3055.06 → 3056.38] It doesn't matter the sin
[3056.38 → 3058.02] that you are still struggling with.
[3058.38 → 3061.08] He never turns away anyone
[3061.08 → 3062.68] who comes to him.
[3065.16 → 3066.70] And so that's the first implication
[3066.70 → 3068.28] of how this affects our lives today.
[3069.24 → 3069.96] And then lastly,
[3071.00 → 3072.96] the reality of the final judgment
[3072.96 → 3073.92] helps us understand
[3073.92 → 3075.54] the love of Jesus for us.
[3075.54 → 3077.10] Right?
[3077.22 → 3079.44] If the judgment of God is just,
[3080.00 → 3082.88] then for Christians to be spared,
[3083.88 → 3085.80] it's not because of any goodness
[3085.80 → 3086.84] we have in ourselves.
[3086.98 → 3087.70] We are sinful.
[3088.66 → 3090.28] As we've confessed earlier,
[3090.70 → 3092.20] we deserve judgment.
[3093.62 → 3095.54] Heaven is not full of good people.
[3095.68 → 3096.64] It's full of sinners
[3096.64 → 3098.74] who have received
[3098.74 → 3101.88] the only remedy for sin
[3101.88 → 3102.86] that God has provided.
[3102.86 → 3104.30] just we've received
[3104.30 → 3106.02] the gift of salvation.
[3106.18 → 3106.86] It's not our gift
[3106.86 → 3107.76] that we receive it.
[3109.22 → 3110.96] And for us to be able to do that,
[3111.48 → 3112.68] for us to be spared,
[3113.06 → 3114.42] it must mean that Jesus
[3114.42 → 3115.94] took the punishment for us.
[3117.08 → 3118.24] And so when we speak
[3118.24 → 3119.66] of the horrors of hell,
[3120.20 → 3121.76] the loss of the presence of God,
[3121.84 → 3123.28] the loss of all things good,
[3123.92 → 3124.56] then friends,
[3124.66 → 3125.80] this is what was happening
[3125.80 → 3126.46] on the cross.
[3126.94 → 3127.14] Right?
[3127.14 → 3128.44] This is what Christ
[3128.44 → 3129.70] was experiencing.
[3130.66 → 3131.42] And when we say,
[3131.52 → 3132.20] well, you know,
[3132.28 → 3133.28] I can't imagine
[3133.28 → 3134.68] a loving God
[3134.68 → 3135.64] sending people to hell.
[3136.72 → 3137.32] Well, as we said,
[3137.38 → 3137.80] that's not quite
[3137.80 → 3138.82] accurate language anyway.
[3139.22 → 3140.38] But what happens is
[3140.38 → 3141.22] if we say that,
[3141.32 → 3142.72] we create a religion
[3142.72 → 3143.94] where it costs God
[3143.94 → 3145.60] nothing to save us.
[3146.88 → 3147.36] Right?
[3147.58 → 3148.78] Where there is no hell
[3148.78 → 3149.86] to be saved from,
[3150.36 → 3152.02] very little love is required.
[3153.40 → 3155.42] And if you want a loving God,
[3156.42 → 3157.34] but you don't want judgment,
[3157.34 → 3159.20] then what does it cost God
[3159.20 → 3159.72] to love you?
[3160.88 → 3161.56] What happens is
[3161.56 → 3162.72] you don't have a loving God.
[3163.96 → 3164.08] Right?
[3164.16 → 3165.70] Where does that God for you
[3165.70 → 3166.78] endure persecution
[3166.78 → 3168.14] and suffering in your place?
[3168.42 → 3169.32] Where is that God
[3169.32 → 3170.46] forsaken for you?
[3171.28 → 3171.44] Right?
[3171.50 → 3172.52] Where are his nails
[3172.52 → 3173.30] and his thorns?
[3174.30 → 3175.32] And the only answer is
[3175.32 → 3176.12] they aren't necessary.
[3177.28 → 3177.52] Right?
[3177.56 → 3178.10] Then, of course,
[3178.16 → 3178.64] we've done it,
[3178.66 → 3179.06] haven't we?
[3179.84 → 3180.08] Right?
[3180.24 → 3182.26] We've shot the wolf.
[3182.40 → 3183.64] We've killed the animals
[3183.64 → 3185.16] that we were so afraid of.
[3185.20 → 3186.16] And the whole ecosystem
[3186.16 → 3187.74] suffers damage
[3187.74 → 3189.14] and death.
[3190.00 → 3190.82] In our efforts
[3190.82 → 3192.32] to make God more loving,
[3192.46 → 3193.10] we have in fact
[3193.10 → 3194.20] stripped him of his love.
[3195.28 → 3196.00] And if there's nothing
[3196.00 → 3196.96] to be saved from,
[3197.08 → 3197.92] you don't need a saviour.
[3199.10 → 3200.06] And all you're left with
[3200.06 → 3201.00] is sentimentality
[3201.00 → 3202.04] and Christmas
[3202.04 → 3203.90] without the manger.
[3206.30 → 3207.84] But if there is indeed
[3207.84 → 3208.66] a final judgment,
[3208.66 → 3210.94] it makes all the sense
[3210.94 → 3212.28] in the world
[3212.28 → 3213.46] of the cross.
[3213.46 → 3216.02] And what we discover
[3216.02 → 3216.96] then is that
[3216.96 → 3218.84] Jesus is the God
[3218.84 → 3220.62] who would go through hell
[3220.62 → 3222.52] for you
[3222.52 → 3224.66] because he loves you.
[3226.10 → 3226.34] Right?
[3226.40 → 3227.78] And that is the God of love
[3227.78 → 3228.68] that is worthy
[3228.68 → 3230.28] of our worship
[3230.28 → 3231.42] and is worthy
[3231.42 → 3232.54] of our trust.
[3233.18 → 3234.12] Who is worthy
[3234.12 → 3235.50] that we would endure
[3235.50 → 3236.18] suffering
[3236.18 → 3237.18] and persecution
[3237.18 → 3238.04] for him
[3238.04 → 3240.34] because he did it for us.
[3240.34 → 3243.58] So let's pray together.
[3251.70 → 3252.50] Heavenly Father,
[3252.64 → 3253.36] you do not
[3253.36 → 3255.34] rejoice
[3255.34 → 3255.98] in the punishment
[3255.98 → 3256.50] of the wicked.
[3258.08 → 3258.56] Father,
[3258.64 → 3259.44] you love the world.
[3261.08 → 3262.28] And when the world
[3262.28 → 3263.84] was in darkness
[3263.84 → 3265.42] and we all
[3265.42 → 3266.54] had our backs
[3266.54 → 3267.28] turned to you,
[3268.38 → 3269.56] you came to us.
[3271.38 → 3272.38] We didn't reach out
[3272.38 → 3272.80] to you,
[3272.88 → 3274.06] but you came down.
[3274.52 → 3275.14] You were born
[3275.14 → 3275.98] into the darkness
[3275.98 → 3276.78] of this world,
[3277.38 → 3278.28] into squalor
[3278.28 → 3279.00] and poverty.
[3279.86 → 3281.40] You became like us
[3281.40 → 3283.70] and you died
[3283.70 → 3284.40] in our place
[3284.40 → 3286.12] as a man.
[3286.94 → 3287.84] You suffered
[3287.84 → 3289.78] the hell
[3289.78 → 3292.28] of the Father
[3292.28 → 3293.54] turning his face away.
[3293.84 → 3294.98] And you did it
[3294.98 → 3296.52] because of love.
[3297.52 → 3297.96] And Father,
[3298.12 → 3299.46] that is the reality
[3299.46 → 3302.76] that we face
[3302.76 → 3305.72] without you.
[3307.62 → 3308.16] And so Lord,
[3308.34 → 3309.50] on the one hand,
[3310.30 → 3311.02] we rejoice.
[3311.20 → 3311.74] We rejoice
[3311.74 → 3312.92] for this great salvation
[3312.92 → 3314.52] that we have received.
[3315.32 → 3316.28] At the same time,
[3316.38 → 3316.54] Lord,
[3316.54 → 3318.74] would you help us
[3318.74 → 3320.20] to just urgently
[3320.20 → 3322.96] proclaim your gospel
[3322.96 → 3324.78] to share it
[3324.78 → 3325.50] with our friends,
[3325.70 → 3327.78] to tell others
[3327.78 → 3328.60] about the life
[3328.60 → 3328.96] and love
[3328.96 → 3329.60] that they can know
[3329.60 → 3330.68] now in Christ
[3330.68 → 3332.00] but also into eternity,
[3332.00 → 3334.00] that they do not
[3334.00 → 3335.32] want to go their own way
[3335.32 → 3336.64] because it is
[3336.64 → 3337.42] not the right way.
[3339.10 → 3339.66] Lord,
[3339.78 → 3340.70] teach us what this
[3340.70 → 3341.16] means.
[3341.70 → 3342.86] It's hard for us
[3342.86 → 3343.70] to understand,
[3344.42 → 3344.74] but Lord,
[3344.84 → 3345.96] would it shape
[3345.96 → 3346.76] what we believe
[3346.76 → 3348.00] and would it make us
[3348.00 → 3348.50] gracious
[3348.50 → 3349.36] and compassionate
[3349.36 → 3350.14] toward others
[3350.14 → 3352.20] and help us
[3352.20 → 3353.10] to face all things
[3353.10 → 3353.80] now knowing
[3353.80 → 3355.38] that judgment
[3355.38 → 3356.00] and justice
[3356.00 → 3356.64] will ultimately
[3356.64 → 3357.22] be done.
[3358.04 → 3358.70] We pray
[3358.70 → 3359.96] in his holy name.
[3360.40 → 3360.70] Amen.
[3362.24 → 3363.04] So friends,
[3363.14 → 3364.08] would you please stand?
[3364.68 → 3365.30] Let's sing
[3365.30 → 3366.20] our song of response
[3366.20 → 3366.50] together.
[3366.50 → 3366.60] Father.
[3386.32 → 3390.60] O worship the King,
[3390.68 → 3392.94] all glorious above,
[3392.94 → 3396.16] O grateful thee sing
[3396.16 → 3399.26] His power and His love,
[3399.74 → 3402.22] a shield and defender
[3402.22 → 3405.40] the ancient of days,
[3405.90 → 3408.78] a villain and splendour
[3408.78 → 3412.32] and good and with praise.
[3413.48 → 3416.60] Frail children of dust
[3416.60 → 3419.38] and feeble as frail,
[3419.38 → 3422.70] in uterine trust,
[3422.70 → 3425.46] nor find you to fail.
[3425.96 → 3428.68] Your mercies are tender,
[3429.06 → 3431.94] how firm to the end,
[3432.28 → 3434.78] our new current defender,
[3435.34 → 3438.80] redeemer and friend.
[3440.00 → 3443.20] O measureless might,
[3443.36 → 3445.98] unchangeable love,
[3445.98 → 3449.32] whom angels divide
[3449.32 → 3452.34] to worship above,
[3452.34 → 3455.60] pure and some creation
[3455.60 → 3457.16] with glory,
[3457.50 → 3458.90] a place,
[3459.26 → 3462.00] in true adoration
[3462.00 → 3463.68] shall sing
[3463.68 → 3467.16] to your praise.
[3467.16 → 3489.00] world,
[3489.00 → 3489.02] Lord,
[3489.02 → 3489.12] and prayer.
[3489.12 → 3501.84] Now this time, as we are praying, every time I say at the end of a section, Lord, in your mercy, please respond with the words, hear our prayer.
[3505.28 → 3507.28] So come, let's come to the Lord.
[3507.64 → 3515.90] Our Lord and Heavenly Father, we come to you, before you this last Sunday of the year with thankful hearts.
[3515.90 → 3530.60] It's winter again, and looking back over the year, we see that in spite of the turmoil of COVID-19 and a year of fires and storms and floods, you have been with us and provided for us.
[3532.02 → 3538.52] But more, we've just celebrated Christmas, reminding us of the hope that you gave us in Jesus.
[3539.52 → 3543.08] Lord, continue with us also in the year to come.
[3543.08 → 3547.42] Lord, show us your love for the sake of Jesus, our Lord.
[3549.00 → 3552.74] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3554.38 → 3562.86] We thank you, Lord, for our congregation here, for the mutual support and encouragement that comes ultimately from you.
[3562.86 → 3575.50] Watch over our pastors and elders and deacons and all who serve, and fill them with your spirit, with wisdom and courage and love that comes from you.
[3576.86 → 3582.52] Help us all to be a light and a sign of your love in this community.
[3582.52 → 3594.18] Be with the lonely among us, Lord, with all those in institutions and with those who are sick in body or mind and grant healing.
[3594.18 → 3614.14] So we hold up before you our brothers and sisters, Doug and Pat and Joan and Cor and Joyce and Carl and Grace and Mark and Hank and Jerry and Anne and Shirley and Diane.
[3614.14 → 3622.14] Father, we ask for healing and restoration.
[3622.14 → 3629.38] Father, we ask for healing and restoration, but above all, for your loving presence to surround and comfort them and their caregivers.
[3629.38 → 3635.20] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3638.70 → 3642.66] We pray, Lord, for your church worldwide.
[3643.72 → 3646.30] In many places it suffers persecution.
[3647.60 → 3649.20] Grant relief, we pray.
[3649.20 → 3659.40] In other places, the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth lure your people away from you.
[3660.84 → 3667.58] Lord, lead us not into temptation and protect us from the miles of the evil one.
[3669.58 → 3674.02] Bless the work of missionaries and evangelists, of doctors and aid workers,
[3674.02 → 3678.70] so that your kingdom may be promoted and your name honoured.
[3680.76 → 3683.00] And Lord, we pray for this whole world.
[3683.54 → 3690.42] There are famines and wars, disease and oppression, and corruption abounds in many places.
[3691.60 → 3694.32] COVID rages on with no end in sight.
[3695.60 → 3698.40] Grant relief and peace, we pray.
[3699.60 → 3703.36] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3704.02 → 3708.48] Father, we pray for our nation.
[3709.36 → 3715.76] Guide our prime minister, our premier, our mayors, and their governments in the way of righteousness,
[3716.66 → 3721.96] so that justice and peace may prevail for all the peoples of this land.
[3723.84 → 3727.14] Lord, we confess that all things are in your hands.
[3728.04 → 3732.72] Lead us then and supply us with our needs as we seek your kingdom.
[3734.02 → 3740.82] Be great, Lord, for your returning and the establishment of that kingdom in all its fullness.
[3742.26 → 3745.40] All this we ask in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[3746.56 → 3750.54] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3750.54 → 3751.74] Amen.
[3751.74 → 3751.86] Amen.
[3766.28 → 3767.48] Would you please stand?
[3767.48 → 3773.40] We see these good words of blessing upon you.
[3773.48 → 3776.68] I invite you to hold out your hands and receive God's blessing.
[3777.72 → 3783.54] Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence,
[3784.00 → 3785.84] without fault and with great joy,
[3786.38 → 3794.58] to the only God, our Saviour, be glory, majesty, power, and dominion before all ages, now and forevermore.
[3794.58 → 3795.62] Amen.
[3796.52 → 3797.54] Let's remain standing.
[3797.68 → 3798.56] We'll sing our final song.
[3798.56 → 3801.54] gospel
[3801.54 → 3816.78] Oh, chili,
[3816.78 → 3819.38] go, rust, go, pray.
[3819.38 → 3822.64] Over the hills and everywhere,
[3822.64 → 3826.16] Oh, heaven and the mountain,
[3826.68 → 3829.64] Lord Jesus Christ is born.
[3830.84 → 3833.64] As shepherds kept their watching,
[3834.50 → 3837.90] O silent flanks by night,
[3838.36 → 3841.86] Behold, throughout the heavens,
[3842.26 → 3846.64] There's shadow of the light.
[3846.64 → 3850.64] Go, tell it on the mountain,
[3851.82 → 3855.64] Over the hills and everywhere,
[3856.12 → 3858.64] Tell it on the mountain,
[3859.58 → 3863.28] That Jesus Christ is born.
[3864.74 → 3867.64] As shepherds feared us from home,
[3868.70 → 3871.64] And low above the earth,
[3871.64 → 3875.92] Rang out the angel chorus,
[3875.92 → 3879.92] That hailed our Saviour's birth.
[3882.42 → 3884.92] Go, tell it on the mountain,
[3884.92 → 3888.92] Over the hills and everywhere,
[3888.92 → 3892.92] Tell it on the mountain,
[3892.92 → 3897.92] That Jesus Christ is born.
[3897.92 → 3901.92] Down in a lonely stable,
[3901.92 → 3905.92] The humble Christ was born,
[3905.92 → 3909.92] And God sent us salvation,
[3909.92 → 3913.92] That blessed Christmas born.
[3913.92 → 3914.92] Jesus Christ is born.
[3914.92 → 3915.92] He is born.
[3915.92 → 3916.92] He is born.
[3916.92 → 3917.92] He is born.
[3917.92 → 3918.92] He is born.
[3918.92 → 3919.92] He is born.
[3919.92 → 3920.92] He is born.
[3920.92 → 3921.92] He is born.
[3921.92 → 3922.92] He is born.
[3922.92 → 3924.92] He is born.
[3924.92 → 3932.82] Tell it on the mountain, God, Jesus Christ is born.
[3954.92 → 3956.92] Amen.
