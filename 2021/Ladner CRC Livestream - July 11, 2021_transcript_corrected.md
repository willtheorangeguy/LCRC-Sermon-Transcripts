[264.04 → 266.74] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church
[266.74 → 268.82] on this beautiful sunny Sunday.
[269.68 → 273.18] My name is Ryan, and I will be helping lead us in worship this morning.
[273.96 → 278.06] Later in the service, Pastor Jason will bring us God's word from Psalm 124,
[278.40 → 281.20] and we'll be sharing communion together as a body of believers.
[281.86 → 284.28] While we won't be having coffee and buns just yet,
[284.56 → 286.56] I do invite you to stay behind at the church,
[287.02 → 290.78] perhaps in the fellowship hall at the back or even outside enjoying the sunny weather,
[291.68 → 296.20] and just get to know each other again after a year and a half of being apart.
[297.34 → 301.02] As Jason mentioned last week, masks are optional but recommended
[301.02 → 304.58] for folks who have not had two doses of vaccine.
[305.10 → 309.46] And of course, feel free to continue wearing your mask, even if you have had two doses.
[310.04 → 312.92] We are a church family, so it hopefully goes without saying,
[313.04 → 316.88], but please be respectful of everybody's decisions and personal spaces.
[318.08 → 320.50] Today's offering is for new immigrant support.
[321.00 → 325.46] This church has done a wonderful job inviting many new families to come live here,
[325.46 → 328.08] and they have in turn enriched our congregation.
[328.88 → 333.08] This ministry is so successful due to the hard work of just a few individuals
[333.08 → 334.84] over the last 15 or so years.
[335.54 → 337.90] And without this congregation's generous support,
[338.38 → 341.12] that work could not be done effectively or frankly at all.
[341.12 → 344.94] And while we will not be passing the collection plate today,
[345.44 → 348.68] please donate in the usual manner we've done for the last year
[348.68 → 351.38] at the donation boxes at the back or online.
[352.72 → 356.28] And lastly, we'll be doing hospital singing this afternoon
[356.28 → 360.96] at Delta Hospital Extended Care Unit at the Mountain View Manor.
[360.96 → 366.64] So if you can make that out, please join us and talk to Marion Tendril for more information on that.
[368.74 → 373.02] And now I invite you to please stand as we turn our hearts and minds
[373.02 → 375.10] to the worship of our Father in Heaven,
[375.30 → 377.42] who calls us with the words of Psalm 29.
[377.42 → 401.54] Let's continue our worship with singing.
[401.54 → 403.66] Come, now is the time to worship.
[403.66 → 433.64] Come, now is the time to worship.
[433.66 → 438.60] Now is the time to worship.
[440.54 → 448.48] Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[448.48 → 455.18] Come, just as you are to worship.
[457.18 → 463.64] Come, just as you are before your God.
[463.66 → 465.16] Come, come, please.
[465.16 → 466.56] Come, in.
[469.10 → 473.22] One day every tongue will confess you our God.
[473.60 → 476.90] One day every knee will bow.
[477.10 → 486.16] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose to love.
[486.16 → 494.80] Come, now is the time to worship.
[496.86 → 504.66] Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[504.66 → 511.48] Come, just as you are to worship.
[511.48 → 521.54] Come, just as you are before your God.
[521.90 → 525.98] Come, now is the time to worship.
[525.98 → 529.74] One day every talk will confess you are God.
[529.74 → 533.74] One day every year will bow.
[534.10 → 541.24] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose to know.
[541.48 → 551.16] Come, now is the time to worship.
[551.16 → 560.98] Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[560.98 → 567.82] Come, just as you are to worship.
[569.82 → 576.66] Come, just as you are before your God.
[576.66 → 586.34] Come, just as you are before your God.
[586.34 → 596.02] Come, just as you are before your God.
[596.02 → 626.02] 
[626.02 → 635.70] Come, just as you are before your God.
[635.70 → 645.38] Come, just as you are before your God.
[645.38 → 649.76] So, careful observers of our bulletin will see that we are supposed to be doing an installation
[649.76 → 652.94] now, but one of the soon-to-be office bearers is sick.
[652.94 → 658.32] So, we'll just continue with our worship and go straight into the singing of Be Thou My Vision.
[658.32 → 660.08] something that leaves us.
[660.08 → 672.16] Medical Computer
[672.16 → 673.16] Amen.
[702.16 → 703.16] Amen.
[732.16 → 734.16] Amen.
[762.16 → 763.16] Amen.
[792.16 → 793.16] Amen.
[822.16 → 823.16] Amen.
[852.16 → 853.16] Amen.
[882.16 → 883.16] Amen.
[912.16 → 913.16] Amen.
[942.16 → 943.16] Amen.
[943.16 → 944.16] Amen.
[944.16 → 958.16] Come, young, and old from every land Men and women of the faith.
[958.16 → 970.16] From those with full or empty hands Find the riches of his praise.
[970.16 → 979.66] Over all the world his people sing, sure to show we hear them call.
[980.22 → 988.72] The truth that cries to every hate, our God is all in all.
[989.94 → 997.98] Rejoice, rejoice, let every day rejoice.
[997.98 → 1006.26] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1008.38 → 1016.02] Rejoice, rejoice, let every day rejoice.
[1016.50 → 1024.14] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1027.98 → 1037.98] Brothers and sisters of the risen Lord, we have been invited to bring our temptations,
[1039.02 → 1042.18] our failings, our sins before God.
[1042.62 → 1046.06] We do not do this in order to be forgiven.
[1047.06 → 1052.28] We do this because we are already forgiven through Christ's blood.
[1052.28 → 1058.14] Our merciful God liberates us from our past and assures us of our future.
[1058.90 → 1061.02] His love for us is unconditional.
[1061.80 → 1063.56] His dominion is absolute.
[1064.20 → 1068.28] As illustrated in the Heidelberg Catechism question and answer number 28.
[1068.76 → 1070.30] Let's read it together now.
[1071.42 → 1076.02] How does the knowledge of God's creation and providence help us?
[1076.02 → 1104.74] Let's pray.
[1106.02 → 1115.50] Heavenly Father, thank you for sending us, your Son Jesus, to suffer on our behalf the wrath that our sins deserve.
[1116.36 → 1122.10] May we always look towards Jesus in times of temptation and grant us strength through him
[1122.10 → 1127.88] so that our sinful ways may be cast aside for your glory alone.
[1127.88 → 1129.10] Amen.
[1129.88 → 1136.20] As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1136.54 → 1138.18] For he knows how we are formed.
[1138.52 → 1140.62] He remembers that we are dust.
[1141.24 → 1143.10] The life of mortals is like grass.
[1143.48 → 1145.34] They flourish like a flower of the field.
[1145.76 → 1147.76] The wind blows over it, and it is gone.
[1148.32 → 1150.46] Its place remembers it no more.
[1150.46 → 1156.30] But from everlasting to everlasting, the Lord's love is with those who fear him
[1156.30 → 1158.76] and his righteousness with their children's children,
[1159.12 → 1162.90] with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
[1163.12 → 1168.42] The Lord has established his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all.
[1168.42 → 1181.96] Amen.
[1181.96 → 1182.96] Amen.
[1211.96 → 1231.20] Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt, yonder on Calvary's mountain court, there were the blood of the Lamb was spent.
[1231.20 → 1244.20] Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will fall in and fall within.
[1245.80 → 1259.20] Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1261.20 → 1274.70] Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can avail to wash it away?
[1274.70 → 1288.70] Look, there is flowing a crimson tide, what earth and snow you may be today.
[1288.70 → 1302.70] Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will fall in and fall within.
[1302.70 → 1317.94] Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1317.94 → 1334.94] All the blessing, heaven and gracious grace.
[1334.94 → 1336.94] Grace, grace, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1336.94 → 1337.94] Grace, grace, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1337.94 → 1340.94] God's grace, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1340.94 → 1341.94] Grace, grace, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1341.94 → 1346.94] You have a longing to see His face.
[1346.94 → 1352.94] Love, how is it more in God's sin.
[1352.94 → 1354.94] Teach, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1354.94 → 1355.44] Remember ta Athlete 1, please ask God's grace.
[1355.94 → 1359.94] Thank you praise, grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1359.94 → 1362.94] Lord, we thank God's grace, God's grace.
[1362.94 → 1364.94] ратьとしては 384, right, thank you clear wig.
[1364.94 → 1369.94] We thank God's grace, on how shall we bless you clear pounding and fall within.
[1369.94 → 1377.98] Grace, grace, God's grace
[1377.98 → 1385.70] Grace that is greater than all our sin
[1393.36 → 1397.66] At this point, I'd like to invite all the children ages 3 through grade 7,
[1397.66 → 1400.58] including my own, to head off to Sunday school.
[1406.36 → 1407.28] Jesus said,
[1407.58 → 1410.16] Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,
[1410.38 → 1413.20] for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
[1413.70 → 1415.24] So be blessed as you go.
[1427.66 → 1435.02] Let us come before the Lord, our God, in this time of congregational prayer.
[1435.02 → 1443.18] Lord God, we here in Ladder come before you this morning with thankfulness.
[1443.18 → 1447.12] Thankfulness for a God who hears and grants our prayers.
[1447.70 → 1450.28] A God who calls us his children.
[1450.94 → 1452.94] A God who came down and walked the earth.
[1453.28 → 1454.74] Who suffered as we do.
[1455.42 → 1458.06] Who ultimately suffered so we do not have to.
[1458.74 → 1463.68] We ask you, Lord, once again to share in and take on our burdens today.
[1463.68 → 1471.40] We pray in earnest for those bearing physical and deliberating hardships.
[1471.88 → 1483.36] Remember, Lord, and be near to Cor, to Andre, to Carl, to Hank, to Mark, to Shirley R,
[1483.36 → 1491.60] to Honda, to Diane, to Get, Jeanette, John, and Henry.
[1492.40 → 1498.88] We pray, Lord, for Jerry, who has suffered a severe stroke and now remains in Delta Hospital.
[1499.88 → 1503.68] Be near to Anne as well through this difficult time of separation,
[1504.16 → 1505.92] as her care is also very difficult.
[1505.92 → 1513.52] And Lord, we pray for those in Lytton and for all the people affected by devastating wildfires year after year.
[1514.16 → 1517.02] Many of these people have lost nearly everything.
[1517.84 → 1518.52] Be near to them.
[1520.00 → 1525.58] Heavenly Father, we are saddened by the news of more victims of residential schools
[1525.58 → 1531.66] who were taken from their parents, suffering from neglect, and often dying across Canada.
[1531.66 → 1539.06] As Canadians, new and old, and as Christians, we ask for forgiveness.
[1540.18 → 1547.72] Forgiveness, Lord, for not doing your will, for neglecting your mercy, for withholding compassion,
[1548.50 → 1552.68] and for not treating our neighbours as your beloved sons and daughters.
[1553.34 → 1560.78] Even now, we forgo peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and gentleness.
[1560.78 → 1568.10] And instead, give in to callousness, indifference, apathy, and even wickedness.
[1568.94 → 1573.62] Soften our hearts and fill us with true and unconditional repentance.
[1574.36 → 1576.62] And forgive us from our sins.
[1577.74 → 1582.82] We also ask for mercy and deliverance for the children today that are still victims of neglect.
[1583.58 → 1586.78] Remember the millions in this world who are suffering and desperate.
[1586.78 → 1593.92] Many of these people in places like Syria, Iraq, South Africa, and Zimbabwe
[1593.92 → 1597.90] watch their way of life disappear in less than a generation.
[1598.76 → 1603.94] We ask, Lord, to bring peace, healing, and comfort to them.
[1605.10 → 1607.58] We pray, too, for our church here in Ladder.
[1608.52 → 1610.54] Guide our work through your Holy Spirit.
[1611.32 → 1613.22] Turn our hearts towards what is good.
[1613.22 → 1617.36] Grant us humility and meekness in all that we do.
[1618.28 → 1622.38] May every deed, thought, and word be for your glory alone.
[1623.42 → 1625.50] As we are called to do by your Son, Jesus,
[1625.98 → 1628.64] may we enter into the world of co-workers and friends,
[1629.26 → 1631.26] of strangers and family members,
[1631.86 → 1636.64] spreading the good news of Scripture in a manner worthy of your name.
[1636.64 → 1642.10] And may the world know we are your disciples by our love for our neighbour.
[1643.04 → 1645.98] Anyone who does not love his neighbour, whom he has seen,
[1646.42 → 1648.64] cannot love you, whom he has not seen.
[1649.20 → 1651.50] All these requests we present to you,
[1652.08 → 1654.26] Almighty God, in the name of Jesus,
[1654.76 → 1656.70] and by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1657.64 → 1657.86] Amen.
[1657.86 → 1658.00] Amen.
[1666.64 → 1672.40] Good morning to all of you.
[1673.54 → 1676.48] And if this is your first time back,
[1677.04 → 1682.52] after having reopened and after having been closed down for a long time,
[1682.64 → 1684.22] we welcome you back.
[1684.34 → 1685.02] I'm glad you're here.
[1685.96 → 1688.42] So this summer, as some of you may know,
[1688.50 → 1691.20] we've been working our way through a sermon series
[1691.20 → 1694.42] on a collection of psalms in the Psalter
[1694.42 → 1696.68] known as the Psalms of Ascent.
[1697.08 → 1699.88] And so this is Psalms 120 through 134.
[1700.08 → 1703.58] And this series is something we're calling Songs for the Journey.
[1704.56 → 1706.30] So these psalms, as we have said,
[1706.64 → 1710.28] were likely sung by God's people, the Israelites,
[1710.76 → 1714.90] on their way to Jerusalem to worship at the great festivals
[1714.90 → 1716.46] in the Jewish calendar.
[1716.82 → 1719.08] Usually about three times a year they would go up.
[1719.08 → 1722.66] And so there was actually a literal ascent
[1722.66 → 1726.02] that was happening as the pilgrims made their way up,
[1726.20 → 1727.98] geographically, to Jerusalem.
[1728.52 → 1732.34] But there's also a metaphor that is happening here.
[1732.70 → 1738.78] Because these psalms also serve as our guide on their journey.
[1739.54 → 1742.06] These psalms are given to us as God's people
[1742.06 → 1744.76] to be our playlist on the journey,
[1745.08 → 1749.00] to remind us of who we are as we go, and we sing,
[1749.08 → 1752.58] to remind us of who we belong to,
[1753.02 → 1756.10] our merciful Father in heaven,
[1756.26 → 1758.44] and also to remind us where we are going,
[1758.90 → 1761.06] to our heavenly home, to Jerusalem,
[1761.24 → 1763.62] and for us, to God's presence.
[1765.02 → 1766.98] And so they teach us how to live today.
[1767.58 → 1768.84] These psalms teach us how to hope.
[1768.84 → 1773.88] They teach us how to flourish as Jesus' disciples
[1773.88 → 1778.98] on this journey of faith that we are all on as Christians in the world.
[1779.48 → 1782.50] And so today, you know, we started in Psalm 120.
[1782.90 → 1785.68] Today we've worked our way up to Psalm 124,
[1785.86 → 1788.36] and we are calling it the rescue song.
[1788.70 → 1789.44] Okay, the rescue song.
[1789.88 → 1791.04] So I will read it for us.
[1791.10 → 1792.28] We'll have the words up on our screen.
[1792.28 → 1795.98] Please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1795.98 → 1799.00] A song of ascents of David.
[1800.00 → 1802.22] If the Lord had not been on our side,
[1802.84 → 1804.16] let Israel say,
[1804.50 → 1807.58] if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us,
[1807.82 → 1809.70] they would have swallowed us alive
[1809.70 → 1812.26] when their anger flared against us.
[1812.92 → 1815.26] The flood would have engulfed us.
[1815.48 → 1817.74] The torrent would have swept over us.
[1818.08 → 1821.02] The raging waters would have swept us away.
[1821.02 → 1826.92] Praise be to the Lord who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
[1827.40 → 1830.34] We have escaped like a bird from the fowler's snare.
[1831.04 → 1833.70] The snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
[1834.46 → 1836.80] Our help is in the name of the Lord,
[1837.34 → 1839.22] the maker of heaven and earth.
[1839.90 → 1841.30] This is the word of the Lord.
[1842.92 → 1843.92] Let's pray together.
[1845.54 → 1848.76] Our Heavenly Father, we are all on this journey of faith,
[1848.76 → 1853.80] and we all face many snares and trials,
[1854.06 → 1856.08] temptations and difficulties on the way.
[1857.46 → 1859.72] And so, Lord, we need to learn this song.
[1860.34 → 1862.74] We need to know how to sing it.
[1863.38 → 1865.52] We need to know that it is true
[1865.52 → 1868.18] and that you have given it to us because you love us.
[1869.20 → 1870.94] Lord, help us to inhabit this song.
[1871.14 → 1872.40] Make it our own.
[1873.24 → 1874.44] And Lord, teach us who you are
[1874.44 → 1875.78] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1875.78 → 1877.22] and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[1877.22 → 1879.10] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1879.58 → 1879.90] Amen.
[1880.88 → 1882.28] So here's a question this morning.
[1883.34 → 1885.30] Have you ever needed rescue?
[1886.54 → 1887.98] Have you ever needed rescue?
[1889.52 → 1889.72] Right?
[1889.80 → 1891.82] Have you ever been in this kind of situations
[1891.82 → 1894.30] where you would have no chance
[1894.30 → 1898.24] unless someone else intervened in the situation
[1898.24 → 1899.80] and saved you?
[1900.90 → 1903.38] You know, sometimes you need help
[1903.38 → 1904.56] and you don't even know it.
[1904.74 → 1906.12] A lot, you know, we can think of kids.
[1906.12 → 1907.50] Sometimes kids, you know,
[1907.54 → 1908.30] when you're a little kid,
[1908.38 → 1910.72] you don't realize the danger that you're in.
[1911.02 → 1913.36] And it's a good thing that you have parents
[1913.36 → 1914.20] or grandparents.
[1915.08 → 1916.42] You know, maybe you've seen those videos
[1916.42 → 1918.56] on TV or YouTube where, you know,
[1918.60 → 1921.48] a parent kind of swoops in right at the last moment
[1921.48 → 1922.62] and saves the kid.
[1923.00 → 1925.34] So there's one I like where there's a boy
[1925.34 → 1927.18] and a dad and some others
[1927.18 → 1928.30] and they're on a fishing dock.
[1929.10 → 1931.26] And the dad is facing away from the water
[1931.26 → 1932.64] and the boy is getting ready.
[1932.64 → 1934.24] He casts his line in
[1934.24 → 1935.70] and he's so enthusiastic,
[1935.98 → 1937.84] the momentum just kind of carries him forward
[1937.84 → 1939.96] and he's about to go flying into the lake
[1939.96 → 1941.70] and the dad kind of second nature
[1941.70 → 1943.90] just goes, foo, catches him like that.
[1944.14 → 1945.58] And then like keeps going about what he's doing.
[1945.86 → 1946.04] Right?
[1946.10 → 1947.58] Because you have this like sixth sense
[1947.58 → 1949.08] that you know when your kid's in danger
[1949.08 → 1949.80] and you're just there,
[1949.88 → 1951.24] you can rescue them.
[1952.62 → 1955.18] And you know, the Bible also is full of rescues.
[1955.86 → 1957.58] Think about what is the big rescue
[1957.58 → 1958.84] right in the beginning of the Bible.
[1958.84 → 1961.44] Well, it's the ark, right?
[1961.48 → 1964.52] God sends the ark to save Noah and his family.
[1965.44 → 1967.62] Think of the exodus from Egypt, right?
[1967.70 → 1970.20] God rescues his people.
[1970.38 → 1972.54] They were in slavery in Egypt.
[1973.08 → 1975.90] So God comes, he rescues them out of Egypt,
[1976.06 → 1979.00] but then the Egyptian army is pursuing them
[1979.00 → 1981.18] and is going to destroy them.
[1981.68 → 1982.60] So what does God do?
[1983.16 → 1984.70] He parts the Red Sea
[1984.70 → 1987.32] and he leads them through, right?
[1987.32 → 1988.78] God rescues his people.
[1989.62 → 1990.40] Think of Jonah.
[1991.12 → 1993.90] Jonah is, the waters are over him.
[1993.96 → 1995.48] He's sinking to the depths
[1995.48 → 1999.42] and God sends a fish and rescues Jonah.
[2000.76 → 2003.26] There are also historic rescues.
[2003.76 → 2005.96] Think of Dunkirk, World War II.
[2006.50 → 2008.50] The German army has the British forces
[2008.50 → 2010.04] trapped against the sea
[2010.04 → 2012.90] and they are not going to fare well.
[2013.70 → 2015.30] And a flotilla of boats
[2015.30 → 2016.66] goes to their rescue,
[2016.66 → 2018.42] lifts the soldiers off the beach.
[2018.42 → 2021.44] It's one of the great modern day rescue stories.
[2022.84 → 2024.20] And friends, in the same way,
[2024.44 → 2028.18] Psalm 124 is a song about how God rescues his people.
[2029.92 → 2032.50] Eugene Peterson says this about Psalm 124.
[2032.50 → 2039.58] He says, Psalm 124 describes the hazardous work of all discipleship
[2039.58 → 2046.04] and declares the help that is always experienced at the hand of God.
[2046.04 → 2049.94] Okay, so this psalm is about hazard,
[2049.94 → 2053.14] but it's also a song about help.
[2055.82 → 2057.66] And because it's about hazard,
[2057.82 → 2060.80] it assumes the suffering,
[2061.50 → 2062.34] the catastrophe,
[2062.88 → 2063.70] the disaster,
[2063.70 → 2068.34] all of these things will be a normal experience of the life of faith.
[2069.56 → 2074.32] As often as there is a non-Christian who is experiencing
[2074.32 → 2078.40] trial, relational difficulties, cancer, sickness,
[2078.94 → 2081.50] there is a Christian who is experiencing the same thing.
[2081.50 → 2086.26] And so with death and doom at their doorstep,
[2086.52 → 2088.92] what do these Israelites do?
[2089.96 → 2092.14] They sing a song of rescue.
[2092.80 → 2092.90] Right?
[2092.96 → 2095.94] They sing about a God who has delivered them before
[2095.94 → 2097.96] and will deliver them again.
[2097.96 → 2100.18] But now here's the question.
[2100.34 → 2101.26] The question is why?
[2101.34 → 2102.48] Why do they sing this song?
[2102.58 → 2104.40] Like, why do they sing a rescue song?
[2106.42 → 2108.40] When we are in crisis, right,
[2108.44 → 2109.92] when danger is at our door,
[2110.26 → 2111.30] what happens to us?
[2111.32 → 2114.00] I think oftentimes we become overwhelmed.
[2114.66 → 2114.86] Right?
[2114.98 → 2115.34] Literally,
[2116.30 → 2117.12] well, I'm not a doctor,
[2117.26 → 2117.62] but, you know,
[2117.68 → 2119.76] there are electrical circuits in our brains
[2119.76 → 2121.32] that become overloaded.
[2121.54 → 2122.96] We become overwhelmed.
[2123.04 → 2124.34] We just can't take it all in.
[2124.40 → 2125.36] We can't think straight.
[2125.36 → 2127.90] We become emotionally distraught.
[2128.52 → 2129.48] And in that state,
[2129.56 → 2132.22] what happens is we forget who we are
[2132.22 → 2133.28] as God's children.
[2133.66 → 2135.66] We forget who God is,
[2136.02 → 2137.42] the creator of heaven and earth.
[2137.72 → 2139.06] We forget God's story,
[2139.16 → 2140.84] that God rescues his people.
[2141.74 → 2143.34] And so in the midst of this crisis,
[2143.34 → 2145.52] we can become untethered.
[2145.58 → 2147.34] We can become lost.
[2148.54 → 2150.62] And so notice what David does here.
[2150.68 → 2151.48] Right in verse 1,
[2151.56 → 2152.74] he starts off the psalm,
[2153.12 → 2156.50] and he is saying to all of God's people,
[2156.84 → 2157.16] he says,
[2157.16 → 2159.46] if the Lord had not been on our side,
[2160.66 → 2160.86] right,
[2160.88 → 2161.42] then he says,
[2161.54 → 2163.28] let Israel say.
[2163.62 → 2165.08] He calls the congregation
[2165.08 → 2167.04] to say it aloud with him.
[2167.26 → 2168.08] Let Israel say,
[2168.16 → 2170.68] if the Lord had not been on our side.
[2171.44 → 2172.70] So what he's doing
[2172.70 → 2175.42] is he's encouraging God's people
[2175.42 → 2176.16] to sing along.
[2177.26 → 2179.26] And what this song then seeks to do
[2179.26 → 2181.54] is cultivate in God's people
[2181.54 → 2183.24] redemptive memory.
[2183.24 → 2186.26] He's trying to cultivate redemptive memory.
[2186.86 → 2187.00] Right?
[2187.04 → 2188.24] It wants to remind us
[2188.24 → 2191.10] that our own journey in life,
[2191.20 → 2191.36] right,
[2191.42 → 2193.36] no matter how dangerous it is,
[2193.92 → 2194.90] it takes place
[2194.90 → 2196.00] within the greater story
[2196.00 → 2196.72] of God's rescue.
[2197.80 → 2199.02] And there are three ways,
[2199.08 → 2199.26] I think,
[2199.32 → 2200.94] that this psalm teaches us this,
[2201.48 → 2203.42] that our journeys take place
[2203.42 → 2204.28] within the greater story
[2204.28 → 2204.94] of God's rescue.
[2205.30 → 2205.62] First,
[2205.70 → 2207.12] it invites us to be honest
[2207.12 → 2209.22] about the hazards of the journey.
[2210.08 → 2210.48] Secondly,
[2210.76 → 2212.54] it points to the help we experience.
[2213.02 → 2213.36] And third,
[2213.42 → 2214.56] it shows us the hand of God.
[2215.12 → 2215.26] Okay,
[2215.30 → 2216.26] so let's jump in
[2216.26 → 2217.54] to this passage.
[2217.64 → 2218.56] We're going to look at it together.
[2218.84 → 2219.60] And the first point
[2219.60 → 2220.94] is the hazards of the journey.
[2222.62 → 2223.96] We see in this text
[2223.96 → 2226.06] this great honesty
[2226.06 → 2227.90] about the hazards
[2227.90 → 2228.78] of the journey.
[2229.86 → 2231.76] So here's Eugene Peterson again.
[2233.44 → 2234.46] Psalm 124
[2234.46 → 2235.36] is an instance
[2235.36 → 2236.18] of a person
[2236.18 → 2238.30] who digs deeply
[2238.30 → 2240.02] into the trouble
[2240.02 → 2241.96] and finds there
[2241.96 → 2242.74] the presence
[2242.74 → 2243.52] of the God
[2243.52 → 2244.36] who is on our side.
[2245.56 → 2246.04] Right?
[2246.10 → 2247.30] And that's what this psalm does,
[2247.36 → 2247.84] first.
[2248.06 → 2249.46] It digs deeply
[2249.46 → 2250.86] into the trouble.
[2251.60 → 2252.14] The trouble
[2252.14 → 2253.40] that we all face
[2253.40 → 2254.34] on the journey
[2254.34 → 2255.16] of the Christian life.
[2255.46 → 2255.72] And see,
[2255.78 → 2257.34] the Bible does not hide
[2257.34 → 2258.38] our troubles
[2258.38 → 2259.96] or our challenges
[2259.96 → 2261.06] or our desperations.
[2261.24 → 2262.40] It doesn't cover them up.
[2262.46 → 2262.82] In fact,
[2262.82 → 2263.80] Psalm 124
[2263.80 → 2266.12] enshrines them in song
[2266.12 → 2267.52] and then makes them
[2267.52 → 2268.46] a vehicle
[2268.46 → 2269.58] for worship.
[2270.62 → 2271.10] And so we're not
[2271.10 → 2271.82] to hide
[2271.82 → 2273.24] these things
[2273.24 → 2274.12] that we face
[2274.12 → 2276.14] but we're to dig deeper.
[2276.82 → 2277.58] We're to dig deeper
[2277.58 → 2278.40] into them
[2278.40 → 2279.68] and there's an honesty
[2279.68 → 2280.32] about naming
[2280.32 → 2281.04] the hazards
[2281.04 → 2281.68] of the journey.
[2282.92 → 2283.04] You know,
[2283.08 → 2283.56] and of course,
[2283.68 → 2284.48] dangers can come
[2284.48 → 2285.38] in all shapes
[2285.38 → 2285.88] and sizes.
[2286.90 → 2287.76] So I heard
[2287.76 → 2288.52] this story
[2288.52 → 2289.80] about a man
[2289.80 → 2290.42] who is lying
[2290.42 → 2291.38] on his sickbed.
[2292.56 → 2294.00] He was on his deathbed,
[2294.12 → 2294.42] actually.
[2294.42 → 2295.88] He was at home
[2295.88 → 2296.80] and he knew
[2296.80 → 2298.22] he was about to die.
[2298.32 → 2298.96] He was only given
[2298.96 → 2300.78] a few days left to live.
[2302.12 → 2303.30] And as he was lying
[2303.30 → 2304.24] there on his bed,
[2304.38 → 2304.98] suddenly,
[2305.62 → 2307.12] he could smell
[2307.12 → 2309.34] the wonderful aroma
[2309.34 → 2311.90] of chocolate chip cookies.
[2313.34 → 2316.14] He loved chocolate chip cookies
[2316.14 → 2318.46] more than any other food
[2318.46 → 2319.34] in the world.
[2319.80 → 2321.14] And these smelled
[2321.14 → 2322.32] so good.
[2323.30 → 2323.84] And so,
[2323.94 → 2325.64] with his last bit
[2325.64 → 2326.52] of energy,
[2326.52 → 2328.02] he pulled himself
[2328.02 → 2329.12] out of his bed
[2329.12 → 2330.98] and just slowly
[2330.98 → 2332.50] made his way
[2332.50 → 2334.00] down the stairs
[2334.00 → 2335.58] and headed
[2335.58 → 2336.38] towards the kitchen.
[2337.10 → 2338.66] And there was his wife
[2338.66 → 2340.16] baking cookies.
[2340.82 → 2342.62] And he reached out
[2342.62 → 2343.42] his hand
[2343.42 → 2344.30] to take a cookie
[2344.30 → 2345.58] and his wife
[2345.58 → 2346.58] took up the spatula
[2346.58 → 2347.66] and smacked
[2347.66 → 2348.30] his hand away.
[2348.30 → 2350.08] Leave those alone,
[2350.26 → 2350.74] she said.
[2351.06 → 2351.44] Therefore,
[2351.64 → 2352.10] the funeral.
[2359.90 → 2360.38] Now,
[2360.46 → 2360.66] of course,
[2360.72 → 2361.96] that's not serious
[2361.96 → 2362.88] and all of us
[2362.88 → 2363.42] have these not
[2363.42 → 2364.64] very serious
[2364.64 → 2365.52] hazards
[2365.52 → 2366.20] that we face
[2366.20 → 2366.60] in life.
[2366.60 → 2368.78] But this psalm
[2368.78 → 2370.16] is talking about
[2370.16 → 2371.20] danger that was real.
[2371.98 → 2372.18] And so,
[2372.32 → 2372.98] look with me again
[2372.98 → 2374.22] at verses 2 to 5.
[2375.80 → 2376.38] If the Lord
[2376.38 → 2377.12] had not been
[2377.12 → 2377.92] on our side
[2377.92 → 2379.54] when people
[2379.54 → 2380.40] attacked us,
[2381.54 → 2382.24] they would have
[2382.24 → 2382.78] been swallowed,
[2382.98 → 2383.42] they would have
[2383.42 → 2384.38] swallowed us alive
[2384.38 → 2385.42] when their anger
[2385.42 → 2386.66] flared against us.
[2387.24 → 2388.08] The flood
[2388.08 → 2389.72] would have engulfed us,
[2389.78 → 2390.18] the torrent
[2390.18 → 2390.76] would have swept
[2390.76 → 2391.34] over us,
[2391.98 → 2393.18] the raging waters
[2393.18 → 2394.18] would have swept
[2394.18 → 2394.66] us away.
[2394.66 → 2396.14] Now,
[2396.20 → 2396.66] we don't know
[2396.66 → 2397.36] for sure
[2397.36 → 2399.38] when this psalm
[2399.38 → 2400.00] was recorded.
[2400.82 → 2401.82] But some commentators
[2401.82 → 2402.56] say that perhaps
[2402.56 → 2403.76] the particular situation
[2403.76 → 2404.94] that David was in
[2404.94 → 2406.06] is,
[2406.22 → 2407.08] what he has in mind
[2407.08 → 2408.58] is from 2 Samuel
[2408.58 → 2409.76] chapter 5.
[2410.56 → 2411.02] And there,
[2411.16 → 2411.80] what happens is
[2411.80 → 2412.94] the Philistines
[2412.94 → 2414.20] had heard
[2414.20 → 2415.04] that David
[2415.04 → 2415.64] had been
[2415.64 → 2416.88] anointed king.
[2417.64 → 2417.92] And so,
[2417.98 → 2418.34] what they do
[2418.34 → 2418.90] in response
[2418.90 → 2419.34] is they're going
[2419.34 → 2420.40] to send their armies
[2420.40 → 2421.06] and they're going
[2421.06 → 2422.44] to try to destroy
[2422.44 → 2423.74] this new
[2423.74 → 2424.86] nascent kingdom.
[2426.38 → 2427.56] Maybe that is
[2427.56 → 2428.16] what's going on
[2428.16 → 2428.68] when David
[2428.68 → 2429.92] wrote these words.
[2430.60 → 2430.80] So,
[2431.04 → 2432.04] he was in
[2432.04 → 2433.12] real danger.
[2434.36 → 2434.80] The psalmist
[2434.80 → 2436.02] uses two images,
[2436.20 → 2436.70] these two
[2436.70 → 2437.60] kind of symbolic
[2437.60 → 2438.28] illustrations
[2438.28 → 2440.42] that represent
[2440.42 → 2441.92] real threats
[2441.92 → 2443.18] that God's people
[2443.18 → 2443.66] face.
[2444.64 → 2444.86] So,
[2444.96 → 2446.24] first is the image
[2446.24 → 2447.86] of an enormous
[2447.86 → 2448.70] dragon
[2448.70 → 2450.16] or a beast.
[2450.16 → 2451.26] So,
[2451.36 → 2451.82] verse 3,
[2451.92 → 2452.60] it talks about
[2452.60 → 2453.56] being swallowed
[2453.56 → 2454.36] up alive.
[2455.16 → 2456.00] Verse 6,
[2456.54 → 2457.34] being torn
[2457.34 → 2458.46] by their teeth.
[2459.78 → 2460.04] Right?
[2460.28 → 2460.90] Nobody's ever
[2460.90 → 2461.56] seen a dragon,
[2462.58 → 2463.44] although we all
[2463.44 → 2463.88] know,
[2464.38 → 2465.22] especially children,
[2465.70 → 2466.50] that they are real.
[2468.48 → 2469.06] And what
[2469.06 → 2470.62] the ancient
[2470.62 → 2471.40] Near East
[2471.40 → 2472.20] readers would
[2472.20 → 2472.94] have heard
[2472.94 → 2473.96] in this imagery
[2473.96 → 2474.80] is just the
[2474.80 → 2475.24] horrible
[2475.24 → 2476.54] manifestation
[2476.54 → 2478.26] of everything
[2478.26 → 2478.96] that we fear,
[2478.96 → 2479.98] of everything
[2479.98 → 2480.62] that might
[2480.62 → 2481.86] harm us,
[2482.22 → 2482.80] that might
[2482.80 → 2484.02] tear us apart.
[2485.68 → 2486.44] The second
[2486.44 → 2487.12] danger here
[2487.12 → 2487.70] is the danger
[2487.70 → 2488.34] of being drowned
[2488.34 → 2488.92] by a flood.
[2489.62 → 2490.52] Verses 4 and 5
[2490.52 → 2491.28] say the flood
[2491.28 → 2492.24] would have engulfed us,
[2492.32 → 2492.78] the torrent
[2492.78 → 2493.26] would have swept
[2493.26 → 2493.80] over us,
[2494.06 → 2494.94] the raging waters
[2494.94 → 2495.52] would have swept
[2495.52 → 2496.00] us away.
[2497.24 → 2498.26] And the setting
[2498.26 → 2499.12] here is in
[2499.12 → 2500.68] the Middle East
[2500.68 → 2501.52] and the dry,
[2501.80 → 2502.66] rugged mountains
[2502.66 → 2503.68] of central Palestine.
[2504.46 → 2505.06] There would be
[2505.06 → 2505.76] these cracks
[2505.76 → 2506.46] and gullies
[2506.46 → 2507.14] in the landscape
[2507.14 → 2508.08] that were all
[2508.08 → 2508.96] connected together.
[2509.70 → 2510.76] And so any rain
[2510.76 → 2511.48] that fell
[2511.48 → 2512.96] on this hard
[2512.96 → 2513.96] baked soil
[2513.96 → 2515.32] quickly runs
[2515.32 → 2516.30] off and collects
[2516.30 → 2516.88] in these narrow
[2516.88 → 2517.64] ravines called
[2517.64 → 2518.08] WAIS.
[2518.64 → 2519.24] And where,
[2519.44 → 2519.80] if you're in
[2519.80 → 2520.64] this Wade,
[2520.92 → 2521.66] the water can
[2521.66 → 2522.68] rise very quickly
[2522.68 → 2524.06] and very dangerously
[2524.06 → 2525.12] in just a few
[2525.12 → 2525.48] minutes.
[2526.52 → 2527.72] So this image
[2527.72 → 2528.70] describes the
[2528.70 → 2529.32] danger
[2529.32 → 2531.72] of a sudden
[2531.72 → 2532.48] disaster
[2532.48 → 2533.94] overtaking us.
[2533.94 → 2535.44] and sometimes
[2535.44 → 2536.12] we experience
[2536.12 → 2536.90] things in our
[2536.90 → 2538.26] lives where
[2538.26 → 2539.70] we're suddenly
[2539.70 → 2540.38] being swept
[2540.38 → 2540.70] away.
[2542.00 → 2542.90] So what I want
[2542.90 → 2543.50] us to see here
[2543.50 → 2543.96] is that there
[2543.96 → 2545.34] are real hazards
[2545.34 → 2546.64] that the people
[2546.64 → 2547.42] of God face
[2547.42 → 2548.08] on their journey
[2548.08 → 2549.74] and that we
[2549.74 → 2551.02] also face
[2551.02 → 2552.18] today on
[2552.18 → 2553.02] our journeys
[2553.02 → 2553.92] as well.
[2555.48 → 2556.36] The great
[2556.36 → 2556.88] boxer
[2556.88 → 2557.78] Muhammad Ali
[2557.78 → 2558.46] was once
[2558.46 → 2559.32] on an airplane.
[2559.32 → 2561.72] the air
[2561.72 → 2562.54] stewardess
[2562.54 → 2563.44] came by
[2563.44 → 2564.52] and asked him
[2564.52 → 2565.04] to please
[2565.04 → 2565.76] put on his
[2565.76 → 2566.14] seatbelt.
[2566.92 → 2567.90] He refused
[2567.90 → 2569.26] and said,
[2569.92 → 2570.30] Superman
[2570.30 → 2571.82] don't need
[2571.82 → 2572.48] no seatbelt.
[2573.82 → 2574.90] The stewardess
[2574.90 → 2575.34] who was very
[2575.34 → 2576.02] quick-witted
[2576.02 → 2576.94] replied,
[2577.66 → 2578.04] Superman
[2578.04 → 2578.60] don't need
[2578.60 → 2579.18] no plane
[2579.18 → 2579.52] either.
[2582.02 → 2582.66] Sometimes
[2582.66 → 2583.58] when we face
[2583.58 → 2584.42] real hazards
[2584.42 → 2584.98] of life
[2584.98 → 2585.72] suddenly we
[2585.72 → 2586.70] realize we
[2586.70 → 2587.16] are not
[2587.16 → 2587.54] Superman.
[2587.54 → 2589.52] and when
[2589.52 → 2590.14] we realize
[2590.14 → 2590.60] that,
[2591.02 → 2592.46] what changes
[2592.46 → 2592.98] come into
[2592.98 → 2593.50] our lives?
[2593.64 → 2593.78] Well,
[2593.90 → 2594.10] you know,
[2595.10 → 2595.62] when we
[2595.62 → 2596.04] realize we're
[2596.04 → 2596.58] not Superman,
[2596.84 → 2597.46] suddenly we
[2597.46 → 2598.10] might decide
[2598.10 → 2598.64] to open up
[2598.64 → 2599.12] our Bibles.
[2600.78 → 2601.36] Suddenly
[2601.36 → 2602.82] we might
[2602.82 → 2603.40] become people
[2603.40 → 2603.98] of prayer.
[2605.68 → 2606.66] We might
[2606.66 → 2607.96] become people
[2607.96 → 2608.80] who then lift
[2608.80 → 2609.68] up our eyes
[2609.68 → 2610.76] to God
[2610.76 → 2611.52] who is the
[2611.52 → 2612.00] one who can
[2612.00 → 2612.82] rescue us.
[2614.74 → 2615.10] Proverbs
[2615.10 → 2615.90] 18,
[2616.06 → 2616.86] verse 10
[2616.86 → 2617.28] says,
[2617.28 → 2617.84] the name
[2617.84 → 2618.22] of the
[2618.22 → 2618.54] Lord
[2618.54 → 2618.92] is a
[2618.92 → 2619.38] strong
[2619.38 → 2620.06] tower.
[2621.00 → 2621.12] The
[2621.12 → 2621.72] righteous
[2621.72 → 2623.34] run into
[2623.34 → 2623.76] it
[2623.76 → 2624.92] and are
[2624.92 → 2625.80] safe.
[2627.10 → 2627.42] And of
[2627.42 → 2627.58] course,
[2627.62 → 2627.80] you don't
[2627.80 → 2628.18] need to
[2628.18 → 2628.86] run into
[2628.86 → 2629.74] a tower
[2629.74 → 2630.46] unless there
[2630.46 → 2631.02] is a
[2631.02 → 2631.86] real danger
[2631.86 → 2632.72] that you
[2632.72 → 2633.44] need protection
[2633.44 → 2633.78] from.
[2634.98 → 2635.54] And so,
[2635.92 → 2636.46] the psalm
[2636.46 → 2636.78] is just
[2636.78 → 2637.04] brutally
[2637.04 → 2637.72] honest to
[2637.72 → 2638.04] say that
[2638.04 → 2638.50] this life
[2638.50 → 2638.90] of faith
[2638.90 → 2639.28] is not
[2639.28 → 2639.76] an easy
[2639.76 → 2640.18] life.
[2640.76 → 2641.08] Right?
[2641.12 → 2641.44] It's not
[2641.44 → 2642.00] a life
[2642.00 → 2642.46] that
[2642.46 → 2643.38] automatically
[2643.38 → 2644.10] insulates
[2644.10 → 2644.86] you from
[2644.86 → 2645.48] pain and
[2645.48 → 2646.06] trouble and
[2646.06 → 2646.42] suffering.
[2646.42 → 2647.64] yet,
[2647.76 → 2648.06] in the
[2648.06 → 2648.66] midst of
[2648.66 → 2649.24] the dangers,
[2649.80 → 2650.28] it is a
[2650.28 → 2651.50] song of
[2651.50 → 2652.08] praise.
[2652.18 → 2652.32] Do you
[2652.32 → 2652.62] know that's
[2652.62 → 2652.94] what this
[2652.94 → 2653.38] song is?
[2653.42 → 2653.64] It's a
[2653.64 → 2654.00] song of
[2654.00 → 2654.56] praise,
[2655.16 → 2656.36] even in
[2656.36 → 2656.64] the midst
[2656.64 → 2657.20] of dangers,
[2657.66 → 2658.26] even when
[2658.26 → 2658.68] there are
[2658.68 → 2659.32] real armies
[2659.32 → 2659.76] attacking,
[2659.88 → 2660.12] there are
[2660.12 → 2660.80] real floods
[2660.80 → 2661.16] that could
[2661.16 → 2661.82] destroy us.
[2662.06 → 2662.34] It's a
[2662.34 → 2662.68] song of
[2662.68 → 2663.30] praise to
[2663.30 → 2664.04] a God
[2664.04 → 2664.50] who
[2664.50 → 2665.12] nevertheless
[2665.12 → 2665.94] is
[2665.94 → 2667.56] wholeheartedly
[2667.56 → 2668.74] committed
[2668.74 → 2670.44] to his
[2670.44 → 2670.96] people
[2670.96 → 2672.16] every step
[2672.16 → 2672.36] of the
[2672.36 → 2672.54] way.
[2672.54 → 2674.52] And that
[2674.52 → 2674.86] leads us
[2674.86 → 2675.12] to the
[2675.12 → 2675.34] second
[2675.34 → 2675.88] point,
[2676.70 → 2677.32] that God
[2677.32 → 2677.98] enacts
[2677.98 → 2679.40] rescue for
[2679.40 → 2679.94] his people.
[2680.52 → 2680.64] Okay,
[2680.70 → 2681.62] so the
[2681.62 → 2682.24] help we
[2682.24 → 2683.00] experience.
[2683.60 → 2684.20] So we
[2684.20 → 2684.54] looked at
[2684.54 → 2685.32] verses 1
[2685.32 → 2686.14] through 5,
[2686.26 → 2686.82] and then the
[2686.82 → 2687.72] turning point
[2687.72 → 2688.10] of this
[2688.10 → 2689.00] psalm is in
[2689.00 → 2689.46] verses 6
[2689.46 → 2689.88] and 7.
[2690.74 → 2691.38] And we
[2691.38 → 2691.94] as readers,
[2692.06 → 2692.48] what happens
[2692.48 → 2693.16] is we begin
[2693.16 → 2694.10] to realize
[2694.10 → 2694.72] that this
[2694.72 → 2695.26] psalm is
[2695.26 → 2696.36] not primarily
[2696.36 → 2697.38] about the
[2697.38 → 2698.40] hazards that
[2698.40 → 2698.96] we face,
[2698.96 → 2699.88] but actually
[2699.88 → 2700.82] it's about
[2700.82 → 2701.46] the help
[2701.46 → 2702.58] we experience.
[2704.44 → 2704.96] Before
[2704.96 → 2706.42] verses 1
[2706.42 → 2706.94] through 5,
[2707.04 → 2707.24] there was
[2707.24 → 2707.86] this near
[2707.86 → 2708.56] certain
[2708.56 → 2709.40] doom
[2709.40 → 2710.36] that we've
[2710.36 → 2710.84] read about.
[2711.10 → 2711.94] The beast
[2711.94 → 2712.34] in the
[2712.34 → 2712.76] waters,
[2712.90 → 2713.28] there's this
[2713.28 → 2714.14] evil
[2714.14 → 2714.80] that is
[2714.80 → 2715.24] seeking to
[2715.24 → 2715.64] hurt us,
[2715.70 → 2715.90] there's
[2715.90 → 2716.06] sudden
[2716.06 → 2716.72] disaster
[2716.72 → 2717.06] that might
[2717.06 → 2717.64] come upon
[2717.64 → 2718.04] us,
[2718.30 → 2719.26] but now
[2719.26 → 2719.68] this is
[2719.68 → 2719.88] all
[2719.88 → 2720.36] dramatically
[2720.36 → 2721.42] overturned
[2721.42 → 2722.12] by God's
[2722.12 → 2722.46] grace.
[2723.16 → 2723.64] So let's
[2723.64 → 2723.92] look at
[2723.92 → 2724.36] verses 6
[2724.36 → 2724.74] and 7
[2724.74 → 2725.30] again.
[2725.98 → 2726.30] Praise
[2726.30 → 2726.74] be to
[2726.74 → 2726.96] the
[2726.96 → 2727.26] Lord
[2727.26 → 2727.98] who has
[2727.98 → 2728.26] not
[2728.26 → 2728.94] let us
[2728.94 → 2729.46] be torn
[2729.46 → 2729.90] by their
[2729.90 → 2730.28] teeth.
[2731.16 → 2731.60] We have
[2731.60 → 2732.28] escaped
[2732.28 → 2733.04] like a
[2733.04 → 2733.36] bird
[2733.36 → 2734.18] from the
[2734.18 → 2734.54] fowler
[2734.54 → 2735.02] snare,
[2735.32 → 2735.84] and the
[2735.84 → 2736.28] snare has
[2736.28 → 2736.78] been broken,
[2737.52 → 2738.04] and we
[2738.04 → 2738.76] have escaped.
[2739.10 → 2739.60] The people
[2739.60 → 2739.90] say,
[2740.16 → 2740.58] God didn't
[2740.58 → 2741.16] leave us,
[2741.38 → 2741.78] God didn't
[2741.78 → 2742.78] abandon us,
[2743.40 → 2744.14] because God
[2744.14 → 2744.82] was on
[2744.82 → 2745.54] our side,
[2745.64 → 2746.22] therefore we
[2746.22 → 2746.56] were not
[2746.56 → 2747.44] devoured by
[2747.44 → 2748.04] the enemy.
[2749.72 → 2750.10] And then it
[2750.10 → 2750.68] talks about
[2750.68 → 2751.42] this bird
[2751.42 → 2752.94] escaping from
[2752.94 → 2753.86] a snare.
[2754.80 → 2755.58] A bird
[2755.58 → 2756.48] can't get
[2756.48 → 2756.96] itself out
[2756.96 → 2757.40] of the cage,
[2757.46 → 2757.88] it cannot
[2757.88 → 2758.36] do anything
[2758.36 → 2759.12] for itself,
[2759.30 → 2759.98] but God
[2759.98 → 2760.88] springs it
[2760.88 → 2761.14] loose,
[2761.20 → 2761.80] it's rescued,
[2761.94 → 2762.20] we are
[2762.20 → 2762.58] free,
[2762.76 → 2763.26] help has
[2763.26 → 2763.62] come.
[2765.28 → 2765.58] Right?
[2765.66 → 2766.14] The beast
[2766.14 → 2767.08] rose up in
[2767.08 → 2767.72] its anger,
[2768.36 → 2768.96] that happened,
[2769.68 → 2770.38] the flood
[2770.38 → 2771.78] waters came
[2771.78 → 2772.28] down,
[2772.60 → 2773.26] that was a
[2773.26 → 2773.90] real danger,
[2774.52 → 2775.38] we could have
[2775.38 → 2776.00] been dinner
[2776.00 → 2776.82] in the beast's
[2776.82 → 2777.04] belly,
[2777.26 → 2778.08] we could have
[2778.08 → 2778.98] been swept
[2778.98 → 2779.64] away,
[2780.02 → 2780.82] but God
[2780.82 → 2782.18] rescued us.
[2782.18 → 2784.44] one commentary
[2784.44 → 2784.98] that I read
[2784.98 → 2785.28] on this
[2785.28 → 2785.54] psalm
[2785.54 → 2786.12] talked about
[2786.12 → 2786.84] this old
[2786.84 → 2788.64] seal that
[2788.64 → 2789.28] was once
[2789.28 → 2789.96] the property
[2789.96 → 2790.62] of a
[2790.62 → 2791.08] Huguenot
[2791.08 → 2791.58] refugee.
[2792.14 → 2792.80] The Huguenots
[2792.80 → 2793.60] were the
[2793.60 → 2793.94] French
[2793.94 → 2794.38] Reformed
[2794.38 → 2795.08] Protestants
[2795.08 → 2795.34] in the
[2795.34 → 2795.92] 16th and
[2795.92 → 2796.42] 17th
[2796.42 → 2796.80] centuries,
[2796.80 → 2798.02] who were
[2798.02 → 2798.94] persecuted by
[2798.94 → 2799.36] the French
[2799.36 → 2799.72] Catholic
[2799.72 → 2800.14] Church,
[2800.14 → 2800.56] so they
[2800.56 → 2801.18] fled the
[2801.18 → 2801.54] country,
[2801.96 → 2802.16] and they
[2802.16 → 2803.00] settled all
[2803.00 → 2803.48] over Europe
[2803.48 → 2804.12] and into
[2804.12 → 2804.78] North America.
[2805.62 → 2805.92] And so on
[2805.92 → 2806.22] of them had
[2806.22 → 2806.74] this seal.
[2806.74 → 2808.30] And on
[2808.30 → 2808.80] the seal
[2808.80 → 2809.52] was a
[2809.52 → 2810.72] net below
[2810.72 → 2811.74] and above
[2811.74 → 2812.90] a bird
[2812.90 → 2813.84] soaring
[2813.84 → 2814.28] upwards,
[2814.74 → 2814.90] right,
[2814.94 → 2815.76] being set
[2815.76 → 2816.10] free.
[2817.04 → 2817.76] And on
[2817.76 → 2818.62] the text
[2818.62 → 2819.52] inscribed
[2819.52 → 2819.96] on the
[2819.96 → 2820.98] seal were
[2820.98 → 2821.72] these words,
[2822.04 → 2822.58] verse 7,
[2823.18 → 2824.06] my soul
[2824.06 → 2825.30] is escaped
[2825.30 → 2826.70] even as a
[2826.70 → 2827.46] bird out
[2827.46 → 2827.90] of the
[2827.90 → 2828.86] snare of
[2828.86 → 2829.42] the fowler.
[2830.30 → 2830.74] It's a
[2830.74 → 2831.50] beautiful image.
[2832.62 → 2833.16] And this
[2833.16 → 2834.22] Huguenot
[2834.22 → 2834.90] refugee
[2834.90 → 2836.30] held onto
[2836.30 → 2837.00] this seal
[2837.00 → 2837.94] because it
[2837.94 → 2838.22] was a
[2838.22 → 2838.68] reminder
[2838.68 → 2839.82] to him
[2839.82 → 2840.62] that he
[2840.62 → 2841.12] had been
[2841.12 → 2841.74] rescued
[2841.74 → 2842.38] from the
[2842.38 → 2842.98] snare of
[2842.98 → 2843.60] his enemies
[2843.60 → 2844.74] by God
[2844.74 → 2845.08] alone.
[2847.52 → 2847.72] You know,
[2847.74 → 2848.12] so maybe
[2848.12 → 2849.08] David wrote
[2849.08 → 2849.38] this,
[2849.40 → 2849.70] as we
[2849.70 → 2850.10] mentioned,
[2850.66 → 2851.00] when he
[2851.00 → 2851.40] was under
[2851.40 → 2851.98] attack by
[2851.98 → 2852.72] the Philistines.
[2853.72 → 2854.08] But he
[2854.08 → 2854.66] also had,
[2855.30 → 2855.62] if you think
[2855.62 → 2855.94] about his
[2855.94 → 2856.14] life,
[2856.20 → 2856.72] a long
[2856.72 → 2857.20] list of
[2857.20 → 2857.58] dangers
[2857.58 → 2858.20] that he
[2858.20 → 2858.60] had come
[2858.60 → 2858.92] through.
[2859.46 → 2859.68] Right?
[2859.74 → 2860.18] Maybe when
[2860.18 → 2860.50] he wrote
[2860.50 → 2860.72] this,
[2860.74 → 2860.98] he was
[2860.98 → 2861.54] remembering
[2861.54 → 2862.74] Goliath
[2862.74 → 2863.62] threatening
[2863.62 → 2864.32] the
[2864.40 → 2864.88] you know,
[2864.94 → 2865.78] the armies
[2865.78 → 2866.90] of Israel.
[2867.70 → 2868.64] Or maybe
[2868.64 → 2869.30] he was
[2869.30 → 2869.76] thinking about
[2869.76 → 2870.26] all the
[2870.26 → 2871.48] close calls
[2871.48 → 2872.16] he had
[2872.16 → 2872.90] when King
[2872.90 → 2873.70] Saul was
[2873.70 → 2874.30] constantly
[2874.30 → 2874.78] trying to
[2874.78 → 2875.16] kill him.
[2876.16 → 2876.88] Or maybe
[2876.88 → 2877.16] he was
[2877.16 → 2877.64] thinking about
[2877.64 → 2878.16] his own
[2878.16 → 2878.66] son,
[2878.80 → 2879.26] Absalom,
[2879.52 → 2880.08] who tried
[2880.08 → 2880.58] to take
[2880.58 → 2881.04] the kingdom
[2881.04 → 2881.76] away from
[2881.76 → 2882.08] him,
[2882.90 → 2883.30] turning
[2883.30 → 2884.34] the people
[2884.34 → 2884.68] of God
[2884.68 → 2885.60] against him
[2885.60 → 2886.20] and forcing
[2886.20 → 2886.84] him to
[2886.84 → 2888.02] flee for
[2888.02 → 2888.68] his life.
[2890.02 → 2890.26] Right?
[2890.60 → 2891.68] David had
[2891.68 → 2892.08] been through
[2892.08 → 2892.30] it.
[2892.30 → 2893.56] time
[2893.56 → 2894.20] and again,
[2895.26 → 2896.04] David and
[2896.04 → 2896.42] God's
[2896.42 → 2897.08] people were
[2897.08 → 2897.68] nearly
[2897.68 → 2898.20] destroyed.
[2899.34 → 2899.76] And if we
[2899.76 → 2900.12] read these
[2900.12 → 2900.54] stories in
[2900.54 → 2900.94] the Bible,
[2901.06 → 2901.42] it seems
[2901.42 → 2902.10] like every
[2902.10 → 2902.58] time you
[2902.58 → 2903.06] read one
[2903.06 → 2903.24] of these
[2903.24 → 2903.60] stories,
[2904.28 → 2904.66] it's like,
[2904.78 → 2904.98] okay,
[2905.08 → 2905.66] this is it.
[2906.16 → 2906.80] He's done
[2906.80 → 2907.16] for this
[2907.16 → 2907.48] time.
[2907.92 → 2908.46] There's no
[2908.46 → 2908.90] way he's
[2908.90 → 2909.26] getting out
[2909.26 → 2909.50] of this
[2909.50 → 2909.70] one.
[2910.24 → 2910.50] And yet,
[2910.60 → 2911.16] time and
[2911.16 → 2912.30] time again,
[2912.98 → 2913.84] they experienced
[2913.84 → 2914.54] deliverance.
[2916.78 → 2917.44] God's people
[2917.44 → 2917.88] know that
[2917.88 → 2918.62] without God's
[2918.62 → 2918.98] help,
[2919.68 → 2920.04] they would
[2920.04 → 2920.44] have no
[2920.44 → 2920.86] existence.
[2920.86 → 2923.30] And what
[2923.30 → 2923.58] does that
[2923.58 → 2924.10] tell us?
[2924.36 → 2925.00] It tells us
[2925.00 → 2926.10] that it's
[2926.10 → 2927.00] not the
[2927.00 → 2927.54] dragon's
[2927.54 → 2927.88] mouth,
[2928.36 → 2929.14] it is not
[2929.14 → 2930.08] the fowler's
[2930.08 → 2930.74] snare,
[2931.06 → 2931.72] it is not
[2931.72 → 2932.38] the dangers
[2932.38 → 2932.84] on the
[2932.84 → 2933.58] journey that
[2933.58 → 2934.90] define us,
[2935.58 → 2936.62] but our
[2936.62 → 2937.94] rescue is
[2937.94 → 2938.44] what defines
[2938.44 → 2938.72] us.
[2938.86 → 2939.36] It is the
[2939.36 → 2940.16] saving grace
[2940.16 → 2940.46] and the
[2940.46 → 2940.86] help of
[2940.86 → 2941.88] God that
[2941.88 → 2943.06] defines our
[2943.06 → 2944.18] lives on
[2944.18 → 2944.64] this journey
[2944.64 → 2945.12] of faith.
[2946.74 → 2947.74] And lastly,
[2947.90 → 2948.32] that leads us
[2948.32 → 2948.72] to our last
[2948.72 → 2949.00] point.
[2949.50 → 2950.38] Psalm 124
[2950.38 → 2951.08] reveals to
[2951.08 → 2951.56] us the
[2951.56 → 2952.82] hand of
[2952.82 → 2953.44] God that
[2953.44 → 2954.18] rescues us.
[2955.14 → 2955.62] So verse
[2955.62 → 2957.00] 8 at the
[2957.00 → 2957.80] very end
[2957.80 → 2958.60] of the
[2958.60 → 2959.84] psalm says
[2959.84 → 2960.44] this,
[2962.64 → 2963.40] our help
[2963.40 → 2964.26] is in the
[2964.26 → 2964.64] name of
[2964.64 → 2965.06] the Lord,
[2965.16 → 2965.54] the maker
[2965.54 → 2966.12] of heaven
[2966.12 → 2966.60] and earth.
[2967.18 → 2967.70] This is
[2967.70 → 2968.18] very similar
[2968.18 → 2969.22] to a
[2969.22 → 2969.86] verse in
[2969.86 → 2970.76] Psalm 121
[2970.76 → 2971.28] that we also
[2971.28 → 2971.74] looked at.
[2972.22 → 2972.56] Our help
[2972.56 → 2972.92] is in the
[2972.92 → 2973.16] name of
[2973.16 → 2973.42] the Lord,
[2973.50 → 2973.78] the maker
[2973.78 → 2974.10] of heaven
[2974.10 → 2974.40] and earth.
[2974.48 → 2974.72] It's a
[2974.72 → 2975.20] refrain that
[2975.20 → 2975.58] we see
[2975.58 → 2976.06] throughout
[2976.06 → 2976.58] the psalms,
[2976.68 → 2976.92] especially
[2976.92 → 2977.16] in the
[2977.16 → 2977.48] Psalms of
[2977.48 → 2977.84] Ascent.
[2978.14 → 2978.38] And what's
[2978.38 → 2978.96] fascinating
[2978.96 → 2979.42] is the
[2979.42 → 2979.82] reformer
[2979.82 → 2980.50] John Calvin,
[2981.00 → 2981.40] when he
[2981.40 → 2982.04] reformed the
[2982.04 → 2982.52] liturgy of
[2982.52 → 2983.02] the church,
[2983.46 → 2984.62] every Sunday,
[2985.06 → 2985.66] the call to
[2985.66 → 2987.34] worship is
[2987.34 → 2988.00] this verse.
[2988.92 → 2989.58] Our help
[2989.58 → 2990.08] is in the
[2990.08 → 2990.52] name of
[2990.52 → 2990.98] the Lord,
[2991.18 → 2991.68] the maker
[2991.68 → 2992.28] of heaven
[2992.28 → 2992.80] and earth.
[2993.06 → 2993.94] Every Sunday.
[2994.60 → 2995.46] Because that
[2995.46 → 2996.42] is what we
[2996.42 → 2997.20] most need to
[2997.20 → 2997.58] believe,
[2997.84 → 2998.12] that is what
[2998.12 → 2998.70] we most need
[2998.70 → 2999.14] to hope in,
[2999.18 → 2999.76] no matter what
[2999.76 → 3000.34] we are facing.
[3000.34 → 3002.56] And we
[3002.56 → 3002.96] can't
[3002.96 → 3004.16] underestimate,
[3004.58 → 3005.00] we can't
[3005.00 → 3005.90] understate
[3005.90 → 3007.00] how important
[3007.00 → 3008.06] it is
[3008.06 → 3009.18] that the
[3009.18 → 3010.06] name of
[3010.06 → 3010.80] the Lord,
[3011.02 → 3011.52] the name
[3011.52 → 3012.30] of God,
[3012.64 → 3013.30] is used
[3013.30 → 3014.00] so many
[3014.00 → 3014.52] times in
[3014.52 → 3015.06] the psalm.
[3015.60 → 3015.92] Did you
[3015.92 → 3016.36] notice,
[3016.64 → 3017.78] four times
[3017.78 → 3018.22] in eight
[3018.22 → 3018.56] verses,
[3019.14 → 3019.44] it says
[3019.44 → 3019.98] the Lord,
[3020.34 → 3020.98] the Lord,
[3021.10 → 3021.54] the Lord.
[3022.44 → 3023.10] And it's
[3023.10 → 3023.52] the word
[3023.52 → 3024.00] Yahweh,
[3024.80 → 3024.96] right?
[3025.02 → 3025.28] Often
[3025.28 → 3025.98] translated as
[3025.98 → 3026.42] the Lord.
[3026.88 → 3027.24] Yahweh,
[3027.40 → 3027.94] the name
[3027.94 → 3028.88] of God.
[3028.88 → 3030.38] And when
[3030.38 → 3030.68] we see
[3030.68 → 3031.34] that phrase
[3031.34 → 3031.66] in this
[3031.66 → 3031.92] verse,
[3032.02 → 3032.60] the name
[3032.60 → 3033.10] of the
[3033.10 → 3033.44] Lord,
[3034.08 → 3034.54] what does
[3034.54 → 3034.80] that mean,
[3034.86 → 3035.34] the name
[3035.34 → 3035.64] of the
[3035.64 → 3035.86] Lord?
[3035.92 → 3036.24] What it
[3036.24 → 3036.86] means is
[3036.86 → 3037.66] it's God's
[3037.66 → 3038.26] revealed
[3038.26 → 3038.70] character.
[3038.84 → 3039.08] It is
[3039.08 → 3039.68] who God
[3039.68 → 3040.06] is.
[3040.70 → 3040.96] It's
[3040.96 → 3041.42] his nature.
[3042.54 → 3042.90] So for
[3042.90 → 3043.14] instance,
[3043.22 → 3043.46] we think
[3043.46 → 3043.76] about the
[3043.76 → 3044.20] Old Testament,
[3044.36 → 3044.62] we think
[3044.62 → 3044.94] of maybe
[3044.94 → 3045.66] the Ten
[3045.66 → 3046.36] Commandments.
[3046.82 → 3047.06] They're
[3047.06 → 3047.68] being given
[3047.68 → 3049.14] to Israel
[3049.14 → 3049.64] in Exodus
[3049.64 → 3050.04] 20,
[3050.18 → 3050.42] and this
[3050.42 → 3050.68] is where
[3050.68 → 3051.38] God comes
[3051.38 → 3051.60] and he
[3051.60 → 3052.00] says,
[3052.64 → 3053.46] I am
[3053.46 → 3054.14] the Lord
[3054.14 → 3054.84] your God,
[3055.20 → 3055.74] the God
[3055.74 → 3056.02] of your
[3056.02 → 3056.88] forefathers,
[3057.04 → 3057.30] Abraham,
[3057.50 → 3057.72] Isaac,
[3057.80 → 3058.22] and Jacob,
[3058.50 → 3058.76] the
[3058.88 → 3059.20] God who
[3059.20 → 3059.78] led you
[3059.78 → 3060.20] out of
[3060.20 → 3060.58] slavery
[3060.58 → 3061.30] in Egypt.
[3062.06 → 3062.58] So when
[3062.58 → 3063.28] God reveals
[3063.28 → 3063.76] himself,
[3063.86 → 3064.28] he reveals
[3064.28 → 3064.78] his name,
[3065.12 → 3066.06] it's all
[3066.06 → 3066.56] part of
[3066.56 → 3066.80] that.
[3067.10 → 3067.48] I am
[3067.48 → 3067.88] the God
[3067.88 → 3068.18] of your
[3068.18 → 3068.82] forefathers.
[3069.08 → 3069.46] I am
[3069.46 → 3069.82] the one
[3069.82 → 3070.22] who has
[3070.22 → 3071.20] seen you
[3071.20 → 3071.92] generation
[3071.92 → 3072.96] after generation.
[3073.16 → 3073.54] I am
[3073.54 → 3073.94] the God
[3073.94 → 3074.74] who delivered
[3074.74 → 3075.14] you out
[3075.14 → 3075.52] of Egypt.
[3075.82 → 3076.28] That's
[3076.28 → 3077.08] the name
[3077.08 → 3077.90] of the
[3077.90 → 3078.08] Lord.
[3078.16 → 3078.48] That is
[3078.48 → 3078.98] who
[3078.98 → 3079.90] God
[3079.90 → 3080.76] is.
[3081.44 → 3081.80] He
[3081.80 → 3082.12] says,
[3082.28 → 3082.78] I am
[3082.78 → 3083.42] the God
[3083.42 → 3084.40] who is
[3084.40 → 3085.04] in covenant
[3085.04 → 3085.62] relationship
[3085.62 → 3086.10] with you.
[3086.60 → 3086.80] Right?
[3086.92 → 3087.30] I am
[3087.30 → 3087.60] the God
[3087.60 → 3088.08] who delivers
[3088.08 → 3088.26] you.
[3088.32 → 3088.62] This is
[3088.62 → 3088.90] who I
[3088.90 → 3089.22] am.
[3090.12 → 3090.54] And what
[3090.54 → 3090.98] the psalmist
[3090.98 → 3091.44] is saying
[3091.44 → 3091.82] is he's
[3091.82 → 3092.94] putting the
[3092.94 → 3093.88] character of
[3093.88 → 3095.18] God at the
[3095.18 → 3095.86] centre of the
[3095.86 → 3096.92] psalm, the
[3096.92 → 3097.32] psalm of
[3097.32 → 3097.74] praise.
[3098.60 → 3099.58] Our help,
[3099.68 → 3100.34] the people of
[3100.34 → 3100.72] God say,
[3100.82 → 3101.54] comes from
[3101.54 → 3103.04] God's own
[3103.04 → 3103.94] self.
[3104.78 → 3105.62] And this is so
[3105.62 → 3106.20] important for us
[3106.20 → 3106.68] to recognize.
[3107.54 → 3108.72] That rescue and
[3108.72 → 3109.62] help is not just
[3109.62 → 3110.40] something that God
[3110.40 → 3113.36] does or
[3113.36 → 3114.06] doesn't,
[3114.72 → 3115.46] or when he
[3115.46 → 3115.88] gets around
[3115.88 → 3116.38] to it.
[3116.74 → 3117.44] It is
[3117.44 → 3118.68] who God
[3118.68 → 3119.64] is.
[3121.34 → 3121.98] And not
[3121.98 → 3122.72] only is he
[3122.72 → 3123.52] our redeemer,
[3123.72 → 3124.28] he is also
[3124.28 → 3125.16] the creator.
[3125.30 → 3125.42] Right?
[3125.44 → 3125.94] It says he is
[3125.94 → 3126.70] the maker of
[3126.70 → 3127.04] heaven and
[3127.04 → 3127.28] earth.
[3127.80 → 3128.30] And what
[3128.30 → 3128.58] does that
[3128.58 → 3128.76] mean?
[3128.80 → 3129.12] It means
[3129.12 → 3129.48] that the
[3129.48 → 3130.00] one who
[3130.00 → 3130.82] made all
[3130.82 → 3131.08] of the
[3131.08 → 3131.40] creatures
[3131.40 → 3131.80] of the
[3131.80 → 3132.02] earth
[3132.02 → 3132.72] is the
[3132.72 → 3133.18] one who
[3133.18 → 3133.68] rescues
[3133.68 → 3134.10] you out
[3134.10 → 3134.28] of the
[3134.28 → 3134.46] mouth
[3134.46 → 3134.68] of the
[3134.68 → 3135.02] beast.
[3135.86 → 3136.46] It means
[3136.46 → 3136.94] that the
[3136.94 → 3137.74] one who
[3137.74 → 3138.82] created the
[3138.82 → 3140.16] oceans and
[3140.16 → 3140.66] the waters
[3140.66 → 3141.12] and who
[3141.12 → 3142.52] said to
[3142.52 → 3142.92] go this
[3142.92 → 3143.30] far and
[3143.30 → 3144.04] no farther
[3144.04 → 3145.32] is the
[3145.32 → 3146.20] one who
[3146.20 → 3146.78] rescues you
[3146.78 → 3147.10] from the
[3147.10 → 3147.36] flood.
[3148.30 → 3148.82] That's who
[3148.82 → 3149.30] God is.
[3149.38 → 3149.78] He is
[3149.78 → 3150.20] sovereign.
[3150.60 → 3150.80] He is
[3150.80 → 3151.64] omnipotent.
[3152.20 → 3152.32] Right?
[3152.40 → 3152.98] He is
[3152.98 → 3153.90] also loving
[3153.90 → 3155.26] and caring
[3155.26 → 3155.76] and he is
[3155.76 → 3156.30] your protector.
[3157.62 → 3158.24] And the
[3158.24 → 3158.94] story of
[3158.94 → 3159.84] this God
[3159.84 → 3161.06] that we
[3161.06 → 3161.52] read about
[3161.52 → 3162.02] all along
[3162.02 → 3162.30] the way
[3162.30 → 3162.76] is the
[3162.76 → 3163.30] story of
[3163.30 → 3163.58] the whole
[3163.58 → 3163.86] Bible.
[3165.20 → 3165.60] And the
[3165.60 → 3166.20] the best way to
[3166.20 → 3166.92] understand the
[3166.92 → 3168.44] Bible is to
[3168.44 → 3168.96] understand it
[3168.96 → 3169.50] like this.
[3169.58 → 3170.14] And what I
[3170.14 → 3170.54] want to do
[3170.54 → 3170.74] is I
[3170.74 → 3170.96] want to
[3170.96 → 3172.20] read for
[3172.20 → 3173.24] you from
[3173.24 → 3173.86] the Jesus
[3173.86 → 3174.64] Storybook
[3174.64 → 3175.22] Bible.
[3175.98 → 3176.24] Do you
[3176.24 → 3176.60] all know
[3176.60 → 3176.98] the Jesus
[3176.98 → 3177.40] Storybook
[3177.40 → 3177.72] Bible?
[3178.44 → 3178.90] If you
[3178.90 → 3179.42] have kids
[3179.42 → 3179.64] and you
[3179.64 → 3180.14] don't have
[3180.14 → 3180.36] one at
[3180.36 → 3180.56] home,
[3180.62 → 3180.90] we have
[3180.90 → 3181.20] a bunch
[3181.20 → 3181.40] in the
[3181.40 → 3181.78] office.
[3181.92 → 3182.24] Come find
[3182.24 → 3182.64] me after
[3182.64 → 3183.08] and we'll
[3183.08 → 3183.32] give one
[3183.32 → 3183.60] to you.
[3184.20 → 3184.70] It's an
[3184.70 → 3185.16] amazing
[3185.16 → 3185.56] Bible.
[3185.76 → 3186.20] It is the
[3186.20 → 3186.50] favourite
[3186.50 → 3187.08] Bible in
[3187.08 → 3187.54] my house.
[3188.06 → 3188.62] So here's
[3188.62 → 3188.92] what it
[3188.92 → 3189.18] says.
[3189.24 → 3189.50] I want to
[3189.50 → 3189.96] put up
[3189.96 → 3190.96] a passage
[3190.96 → 3191.46] for you.
[3192.56 → 3193.24] The Bible
[3193.24 → 3193.76] isn't a
[3193.76 → 3194.06] book of
[3194.06 → 3195.86] rules or
[3195.86 → 3196.28] a book of
[3196.28 → 3196.74] heroes.
[3197.50 → 3198.28] The Bible
[3198.28 → 3199.32] is most of
[3199.32 → 3199.62] all a
[3199.62 → 3199.96] story.
[3200.14 → 3200.84] It's an
[3200.84 → 3201.14] adventure
[3201.14 → 3201.76] story about
[3201.76 → 3202.12] a young
[3202.12 → 3203.08] hero who
[3203.08 → 3203.70] comes from
[3203.70 → 3204.00] a far
[3204.00 → 3204.74] country to
[3204.74 → 3205.34] win back
[3205.34 → 3205.80] his lost
[3205.80 → 3206.12] treasure.
[3206.96 → 3207.46] It's a
[3207.46 → 3208.10] love story
[3208.10 → 3208.56] about a
[3208.56 → 3209.30] brave prince
[3209.30 → 3209.84] who leaves
[3209.84 → 3210.44] his palace,
[3210.86 → 3211.44] his throne,
[3211.94 → 3213.66] everything to
[3213.66 → 3214.98] rescue the
[3214.98 → 3215.28] one he
[3215.28 → 3215.64] loves.
[3216.94 → 3217.64] There are
[3217.64 → 3218.02] lots of
[3218.02 → 3218.56] stories in
[3218.56 → 3218.98] the Bible,
[3219.62 → 3220.10] but all
[3220.10 → 3220.58] the stories
[3220.58 → 3221.04] are telling
[3221.04 → 3221.96] one big
[3221.96 → 3222.34] story.
[3222.92 → 3223.62] The story
[3223.62 → 3224.28] of how
[3224.28 → 3224.86] God loves
[3224.86 → 3225.40] his children
[3225.40 → 3226.52] and comes
[3226.52 → 3226.94] to rescue
[3226.94 → 3227.18] them.
[3227.18 → 3228.18] God
[3228.18 → 3236.40] has
[3236.40 → 3236.72] said,
[3237.44 → 3237.62] if you
[3237.62 → 3238.28] want to
[3238.28 → 3238.84] know my
[3238.84 → 3239.12] name,
[3239.20 → 3239.74] the name
[3239.74 → 3240.24] of the
[3240.24 → 3240.62] Lord,
[3240.84 → 3241.16] if you
[3241.16 → 3241.48] want to
[3241.48 → 3241.86] know what
[3241.86 → 3242.18] I am
[3242.18 → 3242.92] really like,
[3243.00 → 3243.46] you must
[3243.46 → 3244.30] look to
[3244.30 → 3245.20] my son.
[3246.70 → 3247.32] So how
[3247.32 → 3247.82] do we
[3247.82 → 3248.56] know that
[3248.56 → 3249.24] God is
[3249.24 → 3250.14] for us?
[3250.98 → 3251.22] Right?
[3251.34 → 3251.96] The psalm
[3251.96 → 3252.18] says,
[3252.34 → 3252.98] if God
[3252.98 → 3253.42] was not
[3253.42 → 3254.26] for us,
[3254.32 → 3254.62] we would
[3254.62 → 3254.82] have been
[3254.82 → 3255.16] destroyed.
[3255.16 → 3255.76] How do
[3255.76 → 3256.10] we know
[3256.10 → 3256.46] that God
[3256.46 → 3256.78] is for
[3256.78 → 3257.10] us?
[3257.90 → 3258.30] How do
[3258.30 → 3258.58] we know
[3258.58 → 3259.04] the Lord
[3259.04 → 3259.76] is on
[3259.76 → 3260.62] our side?
[3261.88 → 3262.52] The answer
[3262.52 → 3262.92] is that
[3262.92 → 3263.24] you can
[3263.24 → 3263.80] know
[3263.80 → 3265.04] because
[3265.04 → 3265.74] despite
[3265.74 → 3266.52] all of
[3266.52 → 3267.36] the evidence
[3267.36 → 3268.88] of difficulty
[3268.88 → 3269.72] and danger
[3269.72 → 3270.38] and personal
[3270.38 → 3271.34] trouble and
[3271.34 → 3272.08] all the
[3272.08 → 3272.54] stuff that
[3272.54 → 3273.36] we experience,
[3273.80 → 3274.56] despite all
[3274.56 → 3275.04] of that,
[3275.56 → 3276.14] we have
[3276.14 → 3276.90] a message
[3276.90 → 3277.70] in the
[3277.70 → 3278.38] cross
[3278.38 → 3279.84] that outweighs
[3279.84 → 3280.16] it all.
[3281.20 → 3281.42] Right?
[3281.48 → 3282.14] Because Jesus,
[3282.28 → 3282.64] who is God
[3282.64 → 3282.98] himself,
[3283.08 → 3283.42] the maker
[3283.42 → 3283.82] of heaven
[3283.82 → 3284.32] and earth,
[3284.32 → 3285.42] took on
[3285.42 → 3286.14] human nature,
[3286.32 → 3286.88] he entered
[3286.88 → 3287.62] into our
[3287.62 → 3288.10] story,
[3288.20 → 3288.32] right?
[3288.36 → 3288.90] He left
[3288.90 → 3289.86] his palace
[3289.86 → 3290.36] in heaven,
[3290.74 → 3291.24] the glorious
[3291.24 → 3291.66] kingdom,
[3291.84 → 3292.46] he subjected
[3292.46 → 3293.78] himself to
[3293.78 → 3294.50] all the
[3294.50 → 3294.98] hazards
[3294.98 → 3296.12] of life.
[3297.20 → 3298.16] And unlike
[3298.16 → 3299.18] David and
[3299.18 → 3299.82] God's people,
[3300.42 → 3300.98] when people
[3300.98 → 3301.72] rose up against
[3301.72 → 3302.18] Jesus,
[3302.44 → 3303.44] there was no
[3303.44 → 3303.90] help from
[3303.90 → 3304.30] the hand of
[3304.30 → 3304.60] God.
[3305.52 → 3305.72] Right?
[3305.82 → 3306.24] He was
[3306.24 → 3307.20] beaten and
[3307.20 → 3308.04] taken to
[3308.04 → 3308.64] the cross
[3308.64 → 3309.38] to die.
[3310.46 → 3311.16] Jesus was
[3311.16 → 3312.54] actually swallowed
[3312.54 → 3313.66] alive by the
[3313.66 → 3314.40] evil beast
[3314.40 → 3315.36] as a result
[3315.36 → 3315.82] of our
[3315.82 → 3316.22] sin.
[3316.78 → 3317.68] He experienced
[3317.68 → 3318.36] the full
[3318.36 → 3320.24] wrath of
[3320.24 → 3321.38] raging waters,
[3321.80 → 3322.38] the judgment
[3322.38 → 3323.24] of the flood,
[3323.68 → 3324.18] so that we
[3324.18 → 3324.54] could be
[3324.54 → 3324.98] saved.
[3325.66 → 3326.22] Jesus was
[3326.22 → 3326.86] caught in a
[3326.86 → 3327.28] snare that
[3327.28 → 3327.90] he could not
[3327.90 → 3328.48] get out of,
[3328.60 → 3329.32] so that we
[3329.32 → 3329.98] could escape
[3329.98 → 3330.42] and be set
[3330.42 → 3330.70] free.
[3331.60 → 3331.82] Right?
[3331.92 → 3332.52] God sent
[3332.52 → 3333.50] Jesus to
[3333.50 → 3334.16] rescue you.
[3335.10 → 3335.96] And not only
[3335.96 → 3337.02] does he bring
[3337.02 → 3337.70] us through
[3337.70 → 3338.88] many dangers,
[3339.44 → 3339.72] toils,
[3339.80 → 3340.34] and snares,
[3340.34 → 3340.44] others,
[3341.40 → 3342.54] but in
[3342.54 → 3343.32] the process,
[3343.50 → 3344.10] he changes
[3344.10 → 3344.60] us,
[3344.78 → 3345.28] and he
[3345.28 → 3346.24] forms us
[3346.24 → 3346.66] in the midst
[3346.66 → 3346.86] of the
[3346.86 → 3347.20] trials.
[3348.82 → 3349.40] Paul wrote
[3349.40 → 3349.92] in Romans
[3349.92 → 3350.28] 5,
[3350.46 → 3351.20] we rejoice
[3351.20 → 3351.74] in our
[3351.74 → 3352.18] suffering,
[3352.76 → 3353.68] because in
[3353.68 → 3354.86] our suffering,
[3355.40 → 3355.92] perseverance
[3355.92 → 3357.34] and character
[3357.34 → 3358.16] and hope
[3358.16 → 3359.14] are produced.
[3360.26 → 3361.00] Let's think
[3361.00 → 3361.62] about cookies
[3361.62 → 3361.98] again.
[3363.02 → 3363.48] When you're
[3363.48 → 3364.18] making cookies,
[3364.46 → 3365.00] which I don't
[3365.00 → 3365.46] do, but
[3365.46 → 3366.18] when I watch
[3366.18 → 3366.98] my family make
[3366.98 → 3367.54] cookies,
[3368.54 → 3369.08] think about
[3369.08 → 3369.98] each ingredient
[3369.98 → 3370.54] that goes
[3370.54 → 3370.94] into a
[3370.94 → 3371.20] cookie.
[3372.06 → 3372.16] Right?
[3372.20 → 3372.60] It's made
[3372.60 → 3373.64] of some
[3373.64 → 3374.68] stuff that
[3374.68 → 3375.32] you don't
[3375.32 → 3375.80] want to
[3375.80 → 3377.14] eat by
[3377.14 → 3377.68] itself.
[3378.36 → 3378.62] Right?
[3378.72 → 3379.08] There's
[3379.08 → 3380.16] slimy stuff,
[3380.68 → 3381.78] butter that
[3381.78 → 3382.08] has kind
[3382.08 → 3382.30] of been
[3382.30 → 3382.80] sitting at
[3382.80 → 3383.38] room temperature.
[3383.54 → 3383.76] You don't
[3383.76 → 3384.12] really want
[3384.12 → 3384.44] to eat
[3384.44 → 3384.64] that.
[3384.70 → 3384.90] It's kind
[3384.90 → 3385.38] of slimy,
[3385.52 → 3385.78] it's kind
[3385.78 → 3386.12] of gross.
[3386.76 → 3387.20] There is
[3387.20 → 3388.02] bitter stuff,
[3388.78 → 3389.34] salt,
[3390.38 → 3390.64] baking
[3390.64 → 3391.04] powder,
[3391.78 → 3392.54] even chocolate
[3392.54 → 3393.06] before they
[3393.06 → 3393.70] add all the
[3393.70 → 3394.72] sugar is
[3394.72 → 3395.30] very bitter.
[3395.58 → 3395.84] You don't
[3395.84 → 3396.06] want to
[3396.06 → 3396.46] just eat
[3396.46 → 3396.82] that by
[3396.82 → 3397.18] itself.
[3397.24 → 3397.40] You don't
[3397.40 → 3397.60] want to
[3397.60 → 3398.22] be eating
[3398.22 → 3398.78] flour.
[3399.08 → 3400.24] But you
[3400.24 → 3400.80] put it all
[3400.80 → 3401.26] together,
[3401.66 → 3402.08] and you
[3402.08 → 3402.54] mix it
[3402.54 → 3402.80] up,
[3402.88 → 3403.16] and you
[3403.16 → 3403.76] turn up
[3403.76 → 3404.34] the heat,
[3405.28 → 3406.24] and out
[3406.24 → 3407.70] comes the
[3407.70 → 3408.16] glory.
[3408.56 → 3408.72] Right?
[3408.98 → 3409.44] It is
[3409.44 → 3410.62] transformed.
[3411.92 → 3412.34] In goes
[3412.34 → 3412.80] the bitterness,
[3413.28 → 3413.72] up goes
[3413.72 → 3414.20] the heat,
[3414.80 → 3415.40] and out
[3415.40 → 3416.04] comes the
[3416.04 → 3416.28] glory.
[3416.98 → 3417.80] That is
[3417.80 → 3418.62] the methodology
[3418.62 → 3419.98] of God
[3419.98 → 3420.68] to make
[3420.68 → 3421.30] you everything
[3421.30 → 3422.26] he designed
[3422.26 → 3422.78] and created
[3422.78 → 3423.34] you to be
[3423.34 → 3423.56] and to
[3423.56 → 3423.86] become.
[3426.10 → 3426.66] Elizabeth
[3426.66 → 3427.58] Cooler Ross
[3427.58 → 3428.20] is a
[3428.20 → 3428.76] psychiatrist
[3428.76 → 3429.44] who is
[3429.44 → 3430.02] an expert
[3430.02 → 3430.66] on grief
[3430.66 → 3431.22] and death.
[3432.22 → 3432.64] She was
[3432.64 → 3432.98] the one
[3432.98 → 3433.56] who developed
[3433.56 → 3434.26] the five
[3434.26 → 3435.22] stages
[3435.22 → 3436.56] of grief
[3436.56 → 3437.28] that a lot
[3437.28 → 3437.48] of us
[3437.48 → 3437.96] know about.
[3438.22 → 3438.54] This is
[3438.54 → 3438.80] what she
[3438.80 → 3439.08] said.
[3439.14 → 3439.30] I want
[3439.30 → 3439.46] to put
[3439.46 → 3439.80] a quote
[3439.80 → 3440.08] up here
[3440.08 → 3440.54] for us.
[3441.38 → 3441.70] She said,
[3441.70 → 3442.00] the most
[3442.00 → 3442.44] beautiful
[3442.44 → 3443.00] people
[3443.00 → 3444.30] we have
[3444.30 → 3444.78] known
[3444.78 → 3445.88] are those
[3445.88 → 3446.26] who have
[3446.26 → 3446.58] known
[3446.58 → 3447.08] defeat,
[3447.76 → 3448.00] known
[3448.00 → 3448.62] suffering,
[3449.14 → 3449.32] known
[3449.32 → 3449.86] struggle,
[3450.30 → 3450.48] known
[3450.48 → 3451.00] loss,
[3451.22 → 3451.58] and have
[3451.58 → 3452.12] found their
[3452.12 → 3452.78] way out
[3452.78 → 3453.60] of the
[3453.60 → 3454.02] depths.
[3455.16 → 3455.70] Beautiful
[3455.70 → 3456.78] people do
[3456.78 → 3457.20] not just
[3457.20 → 3457.56] happen.
[3459.50 → 3459.98] That's what
[3459.98 → 3460.36] this psalm
[3460.36 → 3460.76] is about.
[3461.38 → 3461.76] But it's
[3461.76 → 3462.82] also about
[3462.82 → 3463.44] not only
[3463.44 → 3464.04] the hazards
[3464.04 → 3464.42] of the
[3464.42 → 3464.66] journey,
[3464.74 → 3464.96] it's about
[3464.96 → 3465.56] a God
[3465.56 → 3466.52] who helps
[3466.52 → 3466.82] us and
[3466.82 → 3467.28] makes a
[3467.28 → 3468.34] way out
[3468.34 → 3468.80] of those
[3468.80 → 3469.16] depths.
[3470.14 → 3470.72] And as
[3470.72 → 3471.08] he does
[3471.08 → 3471.30] that,
[3471.50 → 3472.14] he transforms
[3472.14 → 3472.50] us,
[3472.56 → 3473.00] he saves
[3473.00 → 3473.32] us,
[3473.50 → 3473.76] and he
[3473.76 → 3474.22] sanctifies
[3474.22 → 3474.70] us.
[3476.16 → 3476.52] And what
[3476.52 → 3476.90] this tells
[3476.90 → 3477.20] us is that
[3477.20 → 3477.52] there is
[3477.52 → 3477.92] no way
[3477.92 → 3478.46] to Easter
[3478.46 → 3478.74] without
[3478.74 → 3478.96] Good
[3478.96 → 3479.32] Friday.
[3479.92 → 3480.38] There is
[3480.38 → 3480.68] no way
[3480.68 → 3480.82] to
[3480.82 → 3481.38] resurrection
[3481.38 → 3482.24] without
[3482.24 → 3483.52] Good
[3483.52 → 3483.88] Friday,
[3484.54 → 3484.80] without
[3484.80 → 3485.30] the cross.
[3486.16 → 3486.44] There is
[3486.44 → 3486.82] no way
[3486.82 → 3487.78] home without
[3487.78 → 3488.40] walking through
[3488.40 → 3488.76] the valley
[3488.76 → 3488.98] of the
[3488.98 → 3489.38] shadow of
[3489.38 → 3489.62] death.
[3490.88 → 3491.76] And David
[3491.76 → 3492.30] was not
[3492.30 → 3493.16] set free
[3493.16 → 3493.66] from the
[3493.66 → 3494.34] hazards of
[3494.34 → 3494.64] life.
[3495.08 → 3495.78] His faith
[3495.78 → 3496.18] in God,
[3496.22 → 3496.52] his trust
[3496.52 → 3496.98] in God
[3496.98 → 3497.56] did not
[3497.56 → 3498.34] change
[3498.34 → 3498.86] his
[3498.86 → 3499.64] circumstances,
[3500.32 → 3500.62] but the
[3500.62 → 3501.52] promise here
[3501.52 → 3502.44] that the
[3502.44 → 3503.12] reason David
[3503.12 → 3504.40] praises God
[3504.40 → 3505.50] is that God
[3505.50 → 3506.12] will always
[3506.12 → 3506.46] be our
[3506.46 → 3506.74] help.
[3508.36 → 3508.70] He says
[3508.70 → 3509.06] the Lord
[3509.06 → 3509.66] is on
[3509.66 → 3510.22] our side.
[3510.30 → 3510.48] That's what
[3510.48 → 3511.14] Paul says.
[3512.28 → 3512.44] Right?
[3513.52 → 3514.14] The Lord
[3514.14 → 3514.40] is on
[3514.40 → 3514.92] our side.
[3515.70 → 3515.90] Nothing
[3515.90 → 3516.28] else can
[3516.28 → 3516.50] harm
[3516.50 → 3516.82] us.
[3517.46 → 3517.68] He will
[3517.68 → 3518.08] not leave
[3518.08 → 3518.38] you or
[3518.38 → 3518.74] forsake
[3518.74 → 3518.86] you.
[3518.92 → 3519.32] He promises
[3519.32 → 3519.56] that
[3519.56 → 3520.68] absolutely
[3520.68 → 3521.44] nothing can
[3521.44 → 3522.38] separate you
[3522.38 → 3523.14] from the
[3523.14 → 3523.66] love of
[3523.66 → 3524.00] God.
[3524.54 → 3525.02] Nothing can
[3525.02 → 3525.52] change his
[3525.52 → 3526.30] plan for
[3526.30 → 3526.58] you.
[3526.84 → 3527.10] He is
[3527.10 → 3527.72] faithful
[3527.72 → 3528.48] forever.
[3528.48 → 3528.52] forever.
[3530.36 → 3530.98] Let's
[3530.98 → 3531.44] pray together.
[3535.04 → 3535.66] Our
[3535.66 → 3535.86] Heavenly
[3535.86 → 3536.24] Father,
[3537.24 → 3538.80] we cry
[3538.80 → 3539.14] to you
[3539.14 → 3539.66] for help.
[3540.50 → 3541.08] Each one
[3541.08 → 3541.38] of us
[3541.38 → 3541.76] here this
[3541.76 → 3542.12] morning,
[3542.34 → 3543.98] we are
[3543.98 → 3545.34] facing
[3545.34 → 3546.96] various
[3546.96 → 3547.46] hazards
[3547.46 → 3548.72] on the
[3548.72 → 3549.02] journey.
[3550.68 → 3551.66] The danger
[3551.66 → 3553.28] of evil
[3553.28 → 3554.00] that threatens
[3554.00 → 3554.46] to undo
[3554.46 → 3554.76] us,
[3554.80 → 3555.26] the danger
[3555.26 → 3555.78] of sudden
[3555.78 → 3556.38] loss.
[3558.02 → 3558.58] And Lord,
[3558.82 → 3560.46] we need to
[3560.46 → 3561.00] learn this
[3561.00 → 3561.32] psalm.
[3561.40 → 3561.84] We need to
[3561.84 → 3563.64] learn how
[3563.64 → 3564.08] to know
[3564.08 → 3564.48] that the
[3564.48 → 3565.20] Lord is
[3565.20 → 3565.86] on our
[3565.86 → 3566.28] side.
[3566.94 → 3567.40] He will
[3567.40 → 3568.30] see us
[3568.30 → 3569.08] through into
[3569.08 → 3569.96] his presence.
[3570.56 → 3571.02] He will be
[3571.02 → 3571.40] with us
[3571.40 → 3571.76] forever.
[3571.90 → 3572.16] He is
[3572.16 → 3572.66] faithful.
[3573.48 → 3573.74] He will
[3573.74 → 3574.28] never leave
[3574.28 → 3574.64] us.
[3575.14 → 3575.38] And Lord,
[3575.46 → 3576.00] that changes
[3576.00 → 3576.64] everything.
[3577.72 → 3578.24] That gives
[3578.24 → 3578.82] us hope,
[3579.10 → 3579.94] that can lift
[3579.94 → 3580.50] us up,
[3580.50 → 3581.62] to know
[3581.62 → 3582.66] that we
[3582.66 → 3583.14] are in
[3583.14 → 3583.84] your hands.
[3585.22 → 3585.46] And so
[3585.46 → 3585.74] Lord,
[3586.46 → 3587.16] for each
[3587.16 → 3587.66] one of us,
[3587.72 → 3588.22] whatever we're
[3588.22 → 3589.02] going through,
[3589.30 → 3589.46] Lord,
[3589.54 → 3590.08] be near to
[3590.08 → 3590.40] us.
[3591.32 → 3591.74] Be with
[3591.74 → 3592.10] us.
[3592.82 → 3593.44] Be strong
[3593.44 → 3593.92] for us.
[3594.02 → 3594.46] Be that
[3594.46 → 3596.00] fortress and
[3596.00 → 3596.30] a mighty
[3596.30 → 3596.92] tower that
[3596.92 → 3597.46] we can run
[3597.46 → 3598.04] to for
[3598.04 → 3598.44] protection.
[3599.52 → 3600.10] And we
[3600.10 → 3600.44] pray all
[3600.44 → 3600.84] these things
[3600.84 → 3601.32] in the name
[3601.32 → 3601.58] of our
[3601.58 → 3602.14] Lord Jesus
[3602.14 → 3603.00] who died
[3603.00 → 3604.28] for us
[3604.28 → 3604.70] and rose
[3604.70 → 3605.28] victorious
[3605.28 → 3606.36] and who
[3606.36 → 3606.66] has put
[3606.66 → 3607.40] all things
[3607.40 → 3607.96] under his
[3607.96 → 3609.12] feet and
[3609.12 → 3609.60] will come
[3609.60 → 3610.00] again.
[3610.50 → 3611.16] And bring
[3611.16 → 3611.46] in the
[3611.46 → 3612.04] fullness of
[3612.04 → 3612.34] the kingdom
[3612.34 → 3612.86] of God.
[3613.80 → 3614.42] We pray
[3614.42 → 3614.94] in his
[3614.94 → 3615.22] name.
[3615.72 → 3615.96] Amen.
[3615.96 → 3616.04] Amen.
[3640.50 → 3646.46] We will
[3646.46 → 3660.96] feel the
[3660.96 → 3661.74] battle,
[3662.32 → 3662.82] we will
[3662.82 → 3663.40] feel the
[3663.40 → 3664.20] night.
[3664.50 → 3665.10] We will
[3665.10 → 3665.76] walk the
[3665.76 → 3667.20] valley with
[3667.20 → 3668.16] you by our
[3668.16 → 3668.96] side.
[3668.96 → 3669.96] you will
[3669.96 → 3670.50] go before
[3670.50 → 3671.72] us,
[3671.80 → 3672.36] you will
[3672.36 → 3672.92] lead the
[3672.92 → 3673.58] way.
[3674.12 → 3674.72] We have
[3674.72 → 3675.38] found a
[3675.38 → 3676.28] refuge,
[3676.28 → 3677.46] only you
[3677.46 → 3678.60] can stay.
[3681.08 → 3682.42] Sing with
[3682.42 → 3683.76] joy now,
[3684.08 → 3685.00] our God is
[3685.00 → 3686.18] for us.
[3686.50 → 3687.42] The Father's
[3687.42 → 3688.52] love is a
[3688.52 → 3689.14] strong and
[3689.14 → 3690.64] mighty fortress.
[3691.02 → 3692.04] Raise your

[3693.70 → 3694.60] the love is
[3694.60 → 3695.42] greater.
[3695.42 → 3696.66] who can stand
[3696.66 → 3697.54] against us
[3697.54 → 3698.18] if our
[3698.18 → 3699.30] God is
[3699.30 → 3701.04] for us.
[3705.04 → 3706.46] Even when I
[3706.46 → 3707.12] stumble,
[3707.76 → 3708.88] even when I
[3708.88 → 3709.50] fall,
[3710.10 → 3711.30] even when I
[3711.30 → 3712.42] turn back,
[3712.54 → 3713.46] still your love
[3713.46 → 3714.34] is true.

[3718.24 → 3719.18] forsake,
[3719.64 → 3720.96] you will turn me
[3720.96 → 3721.54] on,
[3721.54 → 3722.10] forever with
[3722.10 → 3723.08] better and
[3723.08 → 3725.16] new ways.
[3726.82 → 3728.04] Sing with
[3728.04 → 3729.34] joy now,
[3729.66 → 3730.54] our God is
[3730.54 → 3731.72] for us.

[3734.72 → 3736.16] mighty fortress.

[3739.28 → 3740.18] the love is

[3750.86 → 3752.02] hide nor
[3752.02 → 3752.92] death
[3752.92 → 3753.26] can
[3753.26 → 3753.92] separate
[3753.92 → 3755.42] us.
[3755.70 → 3756.86] Hell and
[3756.86 → 3757.54] death
[3757.54 → 3758.74] will not
[3758.74 → 3759.30] defeat

[3765.02 → 3765.92] Hope
[3765.92 → 3765.98] is

[3779.28 → 3780.24] will not
[3780.24 → 3780.88] defeat
[3780.88 → 3781.86] us.

[3800.16 → 3801.04] love is
[3801.04 → 3801.66] a strong
[3801.66 → 3802.32] and mighty
[3802.32 → 3803.36] fortress.

[3819.00 → 3819.86] is for
[3819.86 → 3820.44] us.
[3820.76 → 3821.00] The
[3821.00 → 3821.72] Father's
[3821.72 → 3822.62] love is
[3822.62 → 3823.22] a strong
[3823.22 → 3823.90] and mighty
[3823.90 → 3824.94] fortress.
[3825.30 → 3826.36] Raise your

[3828.06 → 3828.66] our God
[3828.66 → 3828.94] is for
[3828.94 → 3829.82] us.
[3830.14 → 3830.40] Who

[3843.48 → 3844.40] You may be
[3844.40 → 3844.62] seated.
[3848.34 → 3849.18] So we are

[3851.46 → 3851.74] Lord's
[3851.74 → 3851.98] Supper.
[3852.62 → 3853.18] And first,
[3853.34 → 3854.14] I hope that
[3854.14 → 3855.04] at least most
[3855.04 → 3855.50] of you were
[3855.50 → 3856.04] able to pick
[3856.04 → 3856.40] up a
[3856.40 → 3856.70] communion
[3856.70 → 3857.10] cup on
[3857.10 → 3857.40] your way
[3857.40 → 3857.78] in.
[3858.16 → 3858.68] If you do
[3858.68 → 3859.38] not have
[3859.38 → 3859.68] one,
[3859.78 → 3860.08] go ahead
[3860.08 → 3860.32] and let
[3860.32 → 3860.58] us know
[3860.58 → 3861.22] right now
[3861.22 → 3862.54] and some
[3862.54 → 3862.86] of our
[3862.86 → 3863.52] ushers can
[3863.52 → 3863.94] bring one
[3863.94 → 3864.28] to you.
[3864.36 → 3864.76] They're ready.
[3864.96 → 3865.30] Does anybody
[3865.30 → 3865.88] need one?
[3866.68 → 3867.06] One up
[3867.06 → 3867.32] here?
[3878.50 → 3878.98] John,
[3879.46 → 3879.76] sorry,
[3880.10 → 3880.48] up front,
[3880.92 → 3881.38] first row.
[3882.26 → 3882.54] Anybody
[3882.54 → 3882.90] else?
[3882.90 → 3889.62] Okay.
[3896.94 → 3897.64] So brothers
[3897.64 → 3898.18] and sisters,
[3898.36 → 3898.82] at this
[3898.82 → 3899.32] table,
[3899.76 → 3900.52] again,
[3900.64 → 3901.06] we are
[3901.06 → 3902.04] reminded of
[3902.04 → 3902.42] who we
[3902.42 → 3902.64] are.
[3903.60 → 3904.08] That we
[3904.08 → 3904.60] are the
[3904.60 → 3905.16] children of
[3905.16 → 3905.44] God.
[3906.44 → 3906.74] And at
[3906.74 → 3907.14] this table,
[3907.36 → 3908.44] we're reminded
[3908.44 → 3909.40] where we
[3909.40 → 3909.94] are going.
[3910.04 → 3910.30] We are
[3910.30 → 3911.80] going to
[3911.80 → 3912.32] the marriage
[3912.32 → 3913.04] supper of
[3913.04 → 3913.60] the Lamb,
[3914.00 → 3914.48] where we
[3914.48 → 3915.16] will sit
[3915.16 → 3916.14] with Christ
[3916.14 → 3917.74] himself and
[3917.74 → 3918.72] feast in
[3918.72 → 3919.22] his eternal
[3919.22 → 3919.60] kingdom.
[3920.66 → 3921.10] And this
[3921.10 → 3921.64] table is
[3921.64 → 3922.44] also food
[3922.44 → 3922.96] for the
[3922.96 → 3923.34] journey,
[3923.70 → 3924.76] where Christ
[3924.76 → 3926.10] himself
[3926.10 → 3926.78] nourishes
[3926.78 → 3927.96] us and
[3927.96 → 3928.54] strengthens
[3928.54 → 3928.92] us.
[3929.64 → 3930.10] And this
[3930.10 → 3930.68] table is
[3930.68 → 3931.32] for Christians
[3931.32 → 3931.70] who have
[3931.70 → 3932.22] been baptized
[3932.22 → 3933.12] and who
[3933.12 → 3933.74] have said,
[3934.00 → 3934.96] this is my
[3934.96 → 3935.40] story.
[3935.96 → 3936.66] This is the
[3936.66 → 3937.36] story that I
[3937.36 → 3937.94] want to live
[3937.94 → 3938.54] into, the
[3938.54 → 3939.56] story of
[3939.56 → 3940.22] God's great
[3940.22 → 3940.94] rescue through
[3940.94 → 3941.68] Jesus Christ
[3941.68 → 3942.08] for his
[3942.08 → 3942.40] people.
[3943.74 → 3944.40] So if you
[3944.40 → 3944.90] are not a
[3944.90 → 3946.24] Christian, if
[3946.24 → 3946.64] you are not
[3946.64 → 3947.22] yet a follower
[3947.22 → 3947.86] of Jesus, we
[3947.86 → 3948.42] are so glad
[3948.42 → 3948.82] that you are
[3948.82 → 3949.12] here.
[3949.76 → 3950.26] And we
[3950.26 → 3950.86] would love to
[3950.86 → 3951.70] talk to you
[3951.70 → 3952.94] about what
[3952.94 → 3953.54] it might look
[3953.54 → 3954.62] like for you
[3954.62 → 3955.14] to come to
[3955.14 → 3955.70] know Jesus
[3955.70 → 3956.44] and for you
[3956.44 → 3956.96] to make
[3956.96 → 3958.28] this story,
[3958.66 → 3959.32] the story of
[3959.32 → 3959.80] the Bible,
[3959.92 → 3960.36] the central
[3960.36 → 3961.42] story of
[3961.42 → 3962.12] your life.
[3963.60 → 3964.16] So what
[3964.16 → 3964.38] we're going
[3964.38 → 3964.86] to do now
[3964.86 → 3965.24] is we're
[3965.24 → 3965.88] going to
[3965.88 → 3966.74] begin singing
[3966.74 → 3967.38] in a moment.
[3967.58 → 3967.94] And as
[3967.94 → 3969.00] we do so,
[3969.04 → 3969.32] I want to
[3969.32 → 3970.70] invite you to
[3970.70 → 3971.48] begin to
[3971.48 → 3972.14] prepare the
[3972.14 → 3972.92] elements that
[3972.92 → 3973.44] you have.
[3973.54 → 3973.90] Maybe you
[3973.90 → 3974.18] can start
[3974.18 → 3975.74] opening them,
[3975.86 → 3976.12] get them
[3976.12 → 3976.54] situated.
[3977.22 → 3978.12] And also, I
[3978.12 → 3978.52] invite you to
[3978.52 → 3979.04] prepare your
[3979.04 → 3979.48] hearts.
[3980.32 → 3980.90] We are going
[3980.90 → 3982.16] to take the
[3982.16 → 3982.92] elements together
[3982.92 → 3983.46] in just a
[3983.46 → 3983.88] moment, not
[3983.88 → 3984.16] yet.
[3984.52 → 3985.00] But first,
[3985.08 → 3985.58] let's sing,
[3986.28 → 3986.82] and then we
[3986.82 → 3987.74] will take them
[3987.74 → 3988.04] together.
[3988.04 → 3988.84] together.
[3989.30 → 3991.22] Looks like this
[3991.22 → 3992.58] here.
[3992.58 → 3993.98] To the
[3993.98 → 3995.74] FM Saved
[3995.74 → 4016.26] Come to the feast of heaven and earth,
[4016.26 → 4023.22] Come to the temple of plenty,
[4023.22 → 4030.72] A grateful lamb for all that we need,
[4030.72 → 4038.22] Here at the table of plenty.
[4044.22 → 4051.22] O come and sit on mountain low,
[4051.22 → 4058.72] Our saints, our sinners, our friends,
[4058.72 → 4065.72] Our way to welcome the lost and lonely,
[4065.72 → 4072.72] To show the hope of the love.
[4072.72 → 4083.22] Come to the feast of heaven and earth,
[4083.22 → 4090.22] Come to the table of plenty,
[4090.22 → 4097.72] God will provide for all that we need,
[4097.72 → 4103.22] Here at the table of plenty.
[4111.22 → 4118.22] O come and eat without money,
[4118.22 → 4124.72] Come to drink with the price,
[4124.72 → 4131.72] My feast of gladness will feed your spirit,
[4131.72 → 4139.22] With faith and fullness of life,
[4139.22 → 4149.22] Come to the feast of heaven and earth,
[4149.22 → 4155.72] Come to the table of plenty,
[4155.72 → 4163.22] God will provide for all that we need,
[4163.22 → 4171.72] Here at the table of plenty.
[4171.72 → 4176.22] Brothers and sisters,
[4176.22 → 4177.22] The Lord Jesus,
[4177.22 → 4179.22] On the night when he was betrayed,
[4179.22 → 4180.22] Took bread,
[4180.22 → 4182.22] And when he had given thanks,
[4182.22 → 4183.22] He broke it,
[4183.22 → 4184.22] And said,
[4184.22 → 4185.22] This is my body,
[4185.22 → 4186.22] Which is for you.
[4186.22 → 4188.22] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4188.22 → 4190.22] The same way,
[4190.22 → 4192.22] He also took the cup after supper,
[4192.22 → 4192.72] Saying,
[4192.72 → 4196.72] This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[4196.72 → 4198.72] As often as you drink it,
[4198.72 → 4201.72] Do so in remembrance of me.
[4201.72 → 4204.72] For whenever you eat this bread,
[4204.72 → 4206.22] And you drink this cup,
[4206.22 → 4208.72] You proclaim the Lord's death
[4208.72 → 4210.72] Until he comes again.
[4210.72 → 4214.72] And I also want to try something new today.
[4214.72 → 4217.22] I have a communion liturgy.
[4217.22 → 4218.72] We'll put it on the screen.
[4218.72 → 4220.22] Let's say this together.
[4220.22 → 4223.22] Brothers and sisters, lift your hearts.
[4223.22 → 4226.22] Lift them up to the Lord.
[4226.22 → 4228.22] Next slide.
[4230.22 → 4232.22] We are his people.
[4232.22 → 4236.22] We are redeemed by his grace.
[4236.22 → 4239.22] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[4239.22 → 4241.22] Christ has died.
[4241.22 → 4243.22] Christ is risen.
[4243.22 → 4245.22] Christ will come again.
[4245.22 → 4247.22] Christ, our Passover,
[4247.22 → 4249.22] Has been sacrificed for us.
[4249.22 → 4250.22] Hallelujah.
[4250.22 → 4251.22] Hallelujah.
[4251.22 → 4252.22] Hallelujah.
[4252.22 → 4256.22] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[4256.22 → 4261.22] Feed on Christ in your hearts by faith with Thanksgiving,
[4261.22 → 4265.22] And drink remembering that Christ died for you.
[4265.22 → 4267.22] So first,
[4267.22 → 4272.22] Take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you.
[4272.22 → 4273.22] Let's eat together.
[4273.22 → 4293.22] Now go ahead and open your cups, which is the most, more challenging of the two.
[4293.22 → 4298.22] If you have any dry cleaning bills, you can send it to the church.
[4298.22 → 4299.22] Okay.
[4299.22 → 4300.22] I'm still here crinkling.
[4300.22 → 4301.22] Okay.
[4301.22 → 4302.22] I'm still here crinkling.
[4302.22 → 4311.22] If you need assistance, ask the person next to you or one of our ushers can come help you too.
[4311.22 → 4312.22] Okay.
[4312.22 → 4334.22] Brothers and sisters, take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for you for the forgiveness of all your sins.
[4334.22 → 4343.22] Let's drink together.
[4343.22 → 4350.22] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this beautiful picture of what you have done for us.
[4350.22 → 4353.22] As on the cross, your body was broken.
[4353.22 → 4359.22] Your blood was poured out so that we might have life.
[4359.22 → 4366.22] And Lord, we thank you that you continue to nourish us with this life, every step of the journey.
[4366.22 → 4374.22] And as we leave here, Lord, we know that you are with us, and that you strengthen us with your life continually by the indwelling of your Holy Spirit,
[4374.22 → 4387.22] by the grace that you not only once on the cross but continually give to us, the presence that is now ours, the empowerment of the Spirit to overcome sin and temptation,
[4387.22 → 4395.22] to change us and to become people like your Son who live with love, generosity, and hope.
[4395.22 → 4410.22] Lord, do all these things and accomplish them in our lives until we feast again with you at your table, with all of your people from every tongue, tribe, and nation, from all times and places gathered before the Lamb.
[4410.22 → 4412.22] Lord, we look forward to that day.
[4412.22 → 4414.22] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4414.22 → 4415.22] Amen.
[4415.22 → 4424.22] Now, friends, I just invite you to stand, and we'll be sent out with God's blessings, benediction over us.
[4424.22 → 4429.22] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving this blessing.
[4429.22 → 4437.22] The Lord will rescue you from every evil attack and will bring you safely to his heavenly kingdom.
[4437.22 → 4440.22] To him be glory forever and ever.
[4440.22 → 4441.22] Amen.
[4441.22 → 4445.22] And let's sing our final response song.
[4445.22 → 4446.22] Amen.
[4454.22 → 4454.72] Amen.
[4454.72 → 4455.22] Amen.
[4455.22 → 4460.22] Amen.
[4460.22 → 4461.22] Amen.
[4461.22 → 4463.22] Amen.
[4463.22 → 4464.22] Amen.
[4464.22 → 4489.40] Salvation belongs to our God
[4489.40 → 4495.18] Whose hands upon the throne
[4495.18 → 4499.88] And to the Lamb
[4499.88 → 4504.98] Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
[4504.98 → 4509.94] Honour and power and strength
[4509.94 → 4515.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4515.16 → 4522.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4522.16 → 4525.46] Be to our God forever and ever
[4525.46 → 4527.16] Amen
[4527.16 → 4534.76] We the redeemed shall be strong
[4534.76 → 4540.16] In purpose and unity
[4540.16 → 4545.16] Declaring the Lamb
[4545.16 → 4550.16] Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
[4550.16 → 4555.16] Honour and power and strength
[4555.16 → 4561.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4561.16 → 4566.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4566.16 → 4571.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4571.16 → 4572.16] Amen
[4572.16 → 4581.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4581.16 → 4590.16] Be to our God forever and ever
[4590.16 → 4592.16] Be to our God forever and ever again
[4592.16 → 4594.16] Amen
[4594.16 → 4624.14] Thank you.
