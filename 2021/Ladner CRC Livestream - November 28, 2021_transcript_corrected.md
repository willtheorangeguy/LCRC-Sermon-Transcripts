[274.72 → 289.24] Good morning.
[289.24 → 290.00] Good morning.
[290.00 → 291.24] Good morning.
[291.24 → 294.92] Welcome here on this first Sunday in Advent.
[294.92 → 299.16] Whether you're here in person or whether you're watching
[299.16 → 305.58] watching online at home. We welcome you. Also, a special welcome to Pastor Len Battering,
[305.66 → 310.48] who is with us this morning, a friend of the congregation who we know well, and we're so
[310.48 → 316.08] glad he's here to fill in for Pastor Jason, who is at home recuperating from illness.
[317.02 → 323.16] We have a few announcements. I was asked by Jana Kulun to mention that the shower this
[323.16 → 329.14] afternoon for Salamis and Grace Area is still on today at 2 p.m. However, please note
[329.14 → 336.78] that you are not asked to bring any food from home. There's more about it on your bulletin
[336.78 → 345.46] this morning. Also, Pastor Jason has prepared an Advent Bible reading plan, and it's a bookmark
[345.46 → 351.16] that's been inserted in your bulletin. So as a congregation, we'd like to follow that.
[351.16 → 358.74] So we're all sort of at the same place during Advent. And I have one announcement. Usually
[358.74 → 365.90] we have a tree in the foyer for our World Renew gift catalogue items, and we decorate that tree.
[366.02 → 371.64] We do not have the tree in the foyer this year. And I did not receive any of these cards. However,
[371.74 → 377.66] I had some from last year. So I have put, I think there's about almost 20 out there. I've laid
[377.66 → 384.70] them in the back sort of according to value. So if you'd like to take one, and if you'd like
[384.70 → 388.68] to decide what you want to give and take one, I think what we'll do is ask you to do that. And at
[388.68 → 394.04] some point when you have a moment, even before the service on Sunday, take it if you've decided
[394.04 → 399.86] that's what you're going to do, and just put it on that third tree closest to the cross. Just hang
[399.86 → 404.12] it on there, and we'll see if we can decorate that tree up a little bit during the Advent season.
[404.12 → 412.58] And I'd just like to invite Jeff Windermere up for the deacons to also give us an announcement
[412.58 → 413.16] this morning.
[424.16 → 425.28] Well, good morning.
[427.06 → 432.64] Just for a last friendly reminder that we'll be collecting Faith Promise Giving next week.
[432.64 → 438.76] This will be the last time you hear about this from me. Or hopefully in the bulletin. Until
[438.76 → 443.64] next year, of course. If you're going to be taking part, please bring them in. You might
[443.64 → 449.32] have already. We thank you. But yeah, so next week, and if you aren't here next week, you
[449.32 → 454.94] can just put it in a deacons mail slot. On another note, and probably more important, we will be
[454.94 → 459.88] having a special offering next week for the Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund. I'm assuming
[459.88 → 466.34] everyone's heard the news of what has happened in various parts of the province from all the
[466.34 → 472.88] rain and flooding. Abbotsford obviously was especially hit hard with the flooding. We decided
[472.88 → 478.00] wanted to support someone local, so thought Abbotsford would be a good place to start.
[478.00 → 484.46] this fund will support frontline agencies providing essential services to affected family and
[484.46 → 489.88] businesses. And obviously a lot of people in our church have connections with the Abbotsford
[489.88 → 500.00] farmers. Well, non-farmers too, but the farming community was hit really hard. When making your contribution,
[500.00 → 505.00] if you're doing it in the budget envelope or the envelopes that the church gives, just put on the cause,
[505.00 → 513.00] Abbotsford relief. If you're writing a check, write a check to the church, but make sure to include in the memo about the
[513.00 → 522.00] Abbotsford relief fund. So we thank you ahead of time for that. And they do as well. The offering that was scheduled for next week,
[522.00 → 533.00] Elude will be moved to the 26th of December. Thank you. And one thing I forgot to mention in our announcements is that this week, our offering is for Delta
[533.00 → 549.00] Christian School. This church has a long history with that school, and we love to keep supporting them as they train up children to lead a life following the Lord.
[549.00 → 573.76] We are all keenly aware of the darkness that surrounds us in so many ways. And Jeff talked about that just a minute ago. Right now, we just invite you to sit quietly and listen to this song, to lament, to hope, and to allow this prayer to enter your hearts in preparation for the Advent season.
[579.00 → 608.98] The day is dark. The night is long. We've lost our laughter, lost our song. Bent on our knees, our heads hung low. We cry, oh Lord, we're
[608.98 → 636.98] when will you come down. Come down, Lord, can't you see us fall? Come down, Lord, don't you hear us call? We are waiting on your grace. Show us your face. Meet us in this place.
[636.98 → 656.98] We've been through fire. We've been through flood. We're sinking in the mire and mud. Furthermore, we feel so lost and all alone. And cry, oh Lord, when will you come down?
[656.98 → 681.98] Come down, Lord, can't you see us fall? Come down, Lord, don't you hear us call? We are waiting on your grace. Show us your face. Meet us in this place.
[681.98 → 711.24] Then through the gloom a light appears, growing brighter, drawing near, a newborn child.
[711.24 → 713.92] The angels tell
[713.92 → 718.44] Is God with us, Emmanuel?
[720.60 → 724.52] God with us lifts us when we fall
[724.52 → 729.24] God with us hears us when we call
[729.24 → 734.68] All compassion, love, and grace
[734.68 → 739.16] Written on your face
[739.16 → 743.62] On your holy face
[743.62 → 748.24] Emmanuel lifts us when we fall
[748.24 → 752.86] Emmanuel hears us when we call
[752.86 → 758.06] All compassion, love, and grace
[758.06 → 762.82] You meet us in this place
[762.82 → 767.48] We have seen your face
[767.48 → 772.94] We have seen your face
[772.94 → 781.98] Please rise for our call to worship
[781.98 → 790.78] From Isaiah 40, verse 3
[790.78 → 793.36] A voice cries
[793.36 → 796.56] In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord
[796.56 → 801.06] Make straight in the desert a highway for our God
[801.06 → 805.52] As we worship today, let us prepare
[805.52 → 809.78] To welcome God's dramatic work into our midst
[809.78 → 814.86] In our hearts, in our community, and in all creation
[814.86 → 816.94] Let us worship God
[816.94 → 820.76] God greets us, people of God, with these words
[820.76 → 823.82] As we enter this season of Advent
[823.82 → 826.52] May the love of God the Father
[826.52 → 829.36] The grace of Jesus the Son
[829.36 → 832.00] And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[832.00 → 834.02] Be and abide with us all
[834.02 → 838.88] Take a moment to just greet one another
[838.88 → 842.26] And then we will have our candle lighting
[842.26 → 843.10] And you can be seated
[843.10 → 843.54] If sensitive them as much as to begin
[843.54 → 857.14] Well, we will began
[857.14 → 871.18] Well, I'll remain
[871.18 → 885.08] Every year we light a candle.
[885.70 → 888.74] We light candles as we prepare for the coming of Christ.
[889.14 → 890.64] More and more candles, more and more light,
[890.94 → 894.72] as we watch and wait for Jesus, the light of the world.
[894.72 → 898.40] Lord, come upon us.
[898.72 → 902.80] Come to your heart, and we do our love to us.
[903.24 → 904.72] We do our love for you, and we do our love for you.
[904.72 → 906.24] We do our love for you, and we do our love for you.
[908.02 → 911.24] Receive God's promise of hope from Psalms 33.
[912.02 → 915.10] The eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him,
[915.36 → 919.14] on those who hope is in his unfailing love,
[919.52 → 923.80] to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
[924.72 → 927.74] We make the hope for the Lord.
[928.32 → 930.54] He gives our help and our shield.
[931.26 → 933.44] In him our hearts rejoice,
[934.06 → 936.26] for we trust in his holy name.
[937.02 → 940.76] May your unfailing love rise upon us, O Lord,
[941.38 → 944.08] even as we put our hope in you.
[954.72 → 981.24] Please stand.
[981.24 → 994.50] Prepare the way of the Lord
[994.50 → 998.48] Prepare the way of the Lord
[998.48 → 1002.14] And all people will see
[1002.14 → 1006.50] The salvation of our God
[1006.50 → 1010.62] Prepare the way of the Lord
[1010.62 → 1018.72] Prepare the way of the Lord
[1018.72 → 1022.46] Prepare the way of the Lord
[1022.46 → 1026.10] And all people will see
[1026.10 → 1030.60] The salvation of our God
[1030.60 → 1034.58] Prepare the way of the Lord
[1034.58 → 1038.46] Prepare the way of the Lord
[1038.46 → 1042.26] And all people will see
[1042.26 → 1046.56] The salvation of our God
[1046.56 → 1068.66] Light of the world, you step down into darkness
[1068.66 → 1074.46] Open my eyes, let me see
[1074.46 → 1080.84] Beauty that made this heart adore you
[1080.84 → 1085.82] Hope of a life spent with you
[1085.82 → 1090.82] Here I am to worship
[1090.82 → 1094.12] Here I am to bow down
[1094.12 → 1099.52] Here I am to say that you're my God
[1099.52 → 1102.54] You're altogether lovely
[1102.54 → 1105.44] Altogether worthy
[1105.44 → 1110.68] Altogether wonderful to me
[1110.68 → 1118.38] King of all days
[1118.38 → 1121.42] Oh so highly exalted
[1121.42 → 1126.36] Glorious in heaven above
[1126.36 → 1131.20] Humbly you came to the earth
[1131.20 → 1132.74] You created
[1132.74 → 1135.38] All for love's sake
[1135.38 → 1137.58] Became poor
[1137.58 → 1141.38] Here I am to worship
[1141.38 → 1142.38] Here I am to worship
[1142.38 → 1143.38] Here I am to worship
[1143.38 → 1145.38] Here I am to bow down
[1145.38 → 1150.38] Here I am to say that you're my God
[1150.38 → 1153.38] You're altogether lovely
[1153.38 → 1156.38] Altogether worthy
[1156.38 → 1161.38] Altogether wonderful to me
[1161.38 → 1165.18] I'll never know
[1165.18 → 1166.18] I'll never know
[1166.18 → 1169.18] How much it costs
[1169.18 → 1174.18] To see my sin upon the cross
[1174.18 → 1177.18] I'll never know
[1177.18 → 1180.18] How much it costs
[1180.18 → 1186.18] To see my sin upon the cross
[1186.18 → 1188.98] Here I am to worship
[1188.98 → 1190.98] Here I am to worship
[1190.98 → 1196.72] Here I am to worship
[1196.72 → 1198.98] Here I am to worship
[1198.98 → 1200.98] Here I am to worship
[1200.98 → 1202.02] Here I am to worship
[1202.02 → 1202.98] Here I am to worship
[1202.98 → 1204.98] Here I am to bow down
[1204.98 → 1207.98] Here I am to say that you're my God
[1207.98 → 1213.02] wonderful to me.
[1213.02 → 1243.00] I love you, Lord, and I lift my word.
[1243.02 → 1273.00] I love you, Lord, and I lift my word.
[1273.02 → 1286.10] I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice.
[1286.10 → 1296.48] To worship you, O my soul, rejoice.
[1296.48 → 1305.48] Take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[1305.48 → 1316.52] May it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1316.52 → 1321.52] I exalt Thee.
[1321.52 → 1326.52] I exalt Thee.
[1326.52 → 1331.52] I exalt Thee.
[1331.52 → 1341.52] I exalt Thee.
[1341.52 → 1347.52] I exalt Thee.
[1347.52 → 1353.52] I exalt Thee.
[1353.52 → 1358.52] Oh, Lord.
[1358.52 → 1359.52] I exalt Thee.
[1359.52 → 1360.52] I exalt Thee.
[1360.52 → 1361.52] I exalt Thee.
[1361.52 → 1363.52] I exalt Thee.
[1363.52 → 1364.52] I exalt Thee.
[1364.52 → 1365.52] I exalt Thee.
[1365.52 → 1366.52] I exalt Thee.
[1366.52 → 1370.52] I exalt Thee.
[1370.52 → 1371.52] I exalt Thee.
[1371.52 → 1372.52] I exalt Thee.
[1372.52 → 1379.90] For our confession time, we have a responsive reading, and we will be asked to read where
[1379.90 → 1384.10] the double arrow is. We've changed things up a little bit, so you have to pay attention.
[1387.54 → 1390.12] Lord Christ, we confess
[1390.12 → 1391.96] our willingness to be loved.
[1396.14 → 1399.90] We confess our readiness to accept your forgiving love.
[1404.68 → 1405.92] We confess our
[1405.92 → 1408.78] eagerness to grasp your offer of redeeming love.
[1409.90 → 1413.16] Also, our resistance to follow you without
[1413.16 → 1414.00] our expectations.
[1415.28 → 1416.94] In this Advent time,
[1417.40 → 1419.62] forgive us for our failure to respond
[1419.62 → 1420.54] as we should.
[1421.64 → 1423.14] Come to us anew
[1423.14 → 1425.04] and by your grace
[1425.04 → 1427.46] assist us to receive you.
[1428.40 → 1429.48] With joy
[1429.48 → 1432.04] as the shepherds.
[1432.78 → 1433.88] With gratitude
[1433.88 → 1435.50] as Simeon.
[1436.24 → 1438.16] With obedience as Mary.
[1438.16 → 1440.32] With love
[1440.32 → 1442.42] as you have loved us.
[1443.42 → 1444.56] Even so,
[1445.04 → 1446.20] come Lord Jesus.
[1446.92 → 1447.44] Amen.
[1449.48 → 1451.64] In 1 Corinthians 1,
[1451.92 → 1453.42] we are assured that Jesus Christ,
[1453.42 → 1454.82] our Lord,
[1455.30 → 1456.86] whose coming we announce
[1456.86 → 1457.86] in this season,
[1458.44 → 1460.80] He is our righteousness.
[1461.84 → 1462.62] In Christ,
[1463.10 → 1465.14] we are made right with God.
[1465.14 → 1467.18] To God be the glory.
[1467.18 → 1489.24] When can it
[1489.98 → 1490.82] Be that
[1490.82 → 1491.32] Oh
[1491.32 → 1492.82] I ship OUR
[1492.82 → 1493.70] Bay
[1493.70 → 1501.32] An interest in the Saviour's blood
[1501.32 → 1508.74] Died he for me, lost his pain
[1508.74 → 1516.54] For me, who caused his bitter death
[1516.54 → 1524.38] Amazing love, how can it be
[1524.38 → 1532.00] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1532.00 → 1539.38] Amazing love, how can it be
[1539.38 → 1547.38] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1548.22 → 1555.38] No condemnation now I dread
[1556.28 → 1563.38] For Christ and all in him is mine
[1563.38 → 1571.38] Alive in him, I live in him
[1571.38 → 1579.38] And both in righteousness divine
[1579.38 → 1587.34] Old I approach the eternal throne
[1587.34 → 1595.34] And laid the crown to Christ my own
[1595.34 → 1604.34] Amazing love, how can it be
[1604.34 → 1613.34] That you, my Lord, should die for me
[1613.34 → 1622.88] I'm going to invite the scripture reader to come up
[1622.88 → 1626.32] Oh, sorry, the kids need to leave
[1626.32 → 1632.24] Yes, we will allow the kids to go to kids' life
[1632.24 → 1635.72] And be blessed
[1643.34 → 1662.16] I will be reading from 2 Peter 3, 1-10
[1662.16 → 1666.30] Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you
[1666.30 → 1669.18] I have written both of them as reminders
[1669.18 → 1671.54] To stimulate you to wholesome thinking
[1671.54 → 1675.48] I want you to recall the words spoken in the past
[1675.48 → 1676.60] By the holy prophets
[1676.60 → 1679.82] And the command given by our Lord and Saviour
[1679.82 → 1681.36] Through your apostles
[1681.36 → 1684.48] Above all, you must understand
[1684.48 → 1687.40] That in the last days scoffers will come
[1687.40 → 1690.22] Scoffing and following their own evil desires
[1690.22 → 1694.06] They will say, where is this coming he promised
[1694.06 → 1696.62] Ever since our ancestors died
[1696.62 → 1698.58] Everything goes on as it has
[1698.58 → 1700.54] Since the beginning of creation
[1700.54 → 1702.60] But they deliberately forget
[1702.60 → 1703.26] But they deliberately forget
[1703.26 → 1705.70] That long ago, by God's word
[1705.70 → 1707.36] The heavens came into being
[1707.36 → 1709.40] And the earth was formed
[1709.40 → 1711.80] Out of water and by water
[1711.80 → 1714.34] By these waters also
[1714.34 → 1718.12] The world of that time was deluged and destroyed
[1718.12 → 1720.68] By the same word
[1720.68 → 1722.46] The present heavens and earth
[1722.46 → 1723.86] Are reserved for fire
[1723.86 → 1726.04] Being kept for the day of judgment
[1726.04 → 1727.98] And destruction of the ungodly
[1727.98 → 1731.74] But do not forget this one thing, dear friends
[1731.74 → 1735.54] With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years
[1735.54 → 1738.10] And a thousand years are like a day
[1738.10 → 1741.82] The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise
[1741.82 → 1744.18] As some understand slowness
[1744.18 → 1747.36] Instead, he is patient with you
[1747.36 → 1750.04] Not wanting anyone to perish
[1750.04 → 1752.72] But everyone to come to repentance
[1752.72 → 1756.40] But the day of the Lord will come like a thief
[1756.40 → 1759.32] The heavens will disappear with a roar
[1759.32 → 1762.56] The elements will be destroyed by fire
[1762.56 → 1765.72] And the earth and everything done in it
[1765.72 → 1767.10] Will be laid bare
[1767.10 → 1769.28] This is the word of the Lord
[1769.28 → 1771.10] Thanks be to God
[1771.10 → 1791.44] Good morning
[1791.44 → 1792.34] Good morning
[1792.34 → 1794.52] A delight to be with you
[1794.52 → 1798.02] Although it would be nice
[1798.02 → 1799.68] If it happened under other circumstances
[1799.68 → 1802.58] Really quite surprised to hear
[1802.58 → 1806.28] That Jason had contracted COVID
[1806.28 → 1809.00] I understand he was vaccinated
[1809.00 → 1811.14] But this can happen
[1811.14 → 1814.94] And we certainly pray for a speedy recovery
[1814.94 → 1817.82] So that soon he can be back where he belongs
[1817.82 → 1819.32] And that's right here
[1819.32 → 1820.62] And leading you
[1820.62 → 1822.80] But you know, my wife and I were here
[1822.80 → 1824.42] Quite a bit of several years ago
[1824.42 → 1827.22] Between Pastor Mike and Pastor Jason
[1827.22 → 1830.20] And we really grew kind of fond of this church
[1830.20 → 1832.32] It became kind of a second home for us
[1832.32 → 1834.78] And it's nice to be back
[1834.78 → 1835.50] That's for sure
[1835.50 → 1838.94] Although I'm also very excited
[1838.94 → 1840.80] About some of the things that are happening here
[1840.80 → 1842.82] Especially with Pastor Nancy
[1842.82 → 1843.86] Coming on board
[1843.86 → 1846.06] And leading the Mandarin ministry
[1846.06 → 1848.66] You may remember that
[1848.66 → 1850.88] Maybe two months ago or so
[1850.88 → 1851.76] She preached here
[1851.76 → 1855.26] And that was a classist examination sermon
[1855.26 → 1857.34] There were a number of sermon critics
[1857.34 → 1859.66] Appointed by classes to hear her preach
[1859.66 → 1862.12] And then sometime later
[1862.12 → 1863.96] Classes met by Zoom
[1863.96 → 1866.84] And they reported on how that went
[1866.84 → 1869.04] And then she also had an interview
[1869.04 → 1870.86] And she was interviewed
[1870.86 → 1874.88] And questioned about her call to ministry
[1874.88 → 1877.10] About her story
[1877.10 → 1878.34] Her journey of faith
[1878.34 → 1880.98] And then also about her knowledge
[1880.98 → 1883.26] Of theology and scripture
[1883.26 → 1886.16] And as they sometimes say
[1886.16 → 1887.58] Nancy hit it out of the park
[1887.58 → 1889.46] She was really a lovely candidate
[1889.46 → 1891.68] And it was a real blessing to see that
[1891.68 → 1893.44] So that's really exciting
[1893.44 → 1894.30] What's happening here
[1894.30 → 1896.64] And I certainly look forward to seeing
[1896.64 → 1897.98] Where God is taking you
[1897.98 → 1899.50] Moving into the future
[1899.50 → 1902.42] Okay, it's already been mentioned
[1902.42 → 1903.26] This is Advent
[1903.26 → 1906.54] And Advent, you may know
[1906.54 → 1909.08] Is a Latin word that means coming
[1909.08 → 1910.68] Or arrival
[1910.68 → 1914.42] And we think most of the Christmas story
[1914.42 → 1917.54] Of Jesus being born in Bethlehem
[1917.54 → 1920.38] And that was the arrival of the Son of God
[1920.38 → 1922.18] Clothed in human flesh
[1922.18 → 1923.60] He came into our world
[1923.60 → 1925.78] And he lived for a while among us
[1925.78 → 1929.56] And it began in that stable in Bethlehem
[1929.56 → 1934.94] But we also look forward to a second Advent
[1934.94 → 1937.00] A second coming of Jesus
[1937.00 → 1938.92] And that's in the future
[1938.92 → 1941.48] So we are in between the times, right?
[1942.00 → 1943.64] Between the first and second coming
[1943.64 → 1945.84] And I'm going to focus this week and next
[1945.84 → 1948.22] On that second coming
[1948.22 → 1950.32] That we are waiting for
[1950.32 → 1953.64] So the world once waited for a Saviour to appear
[1953.64 → 1954.58] And he did
[1954.58 → 1957.94] Now we wait again for him to return
[1957.94 → 1960.36] When he will come in power
[1960.36 → 1962.10] To judge the living and the dead
[1962.10 → 1963.48] So thoughts on that
[1963.48 → 1966.08] Now Goa read 2 Peter 3 verse 10
[1966.08 → 1969.64] And I'm just going to underline a couple of verses
[1969.64 → 1971.10] From that reading
[1971.10 → 1975.32] Particularly verses
[1975.32 → 1979.28] Here the verses 4 and 5
[1979.28 → 1981.28] Verse 4 we have these scoffers
[1981.28 → 1982.06] And they say
[1982.06 → 1984.36] Where is this coming that he promised
[1984.36 → 1986.52] Ever since our ancestors died
[1986.52 → 1988.94] Everything goes on as it has since the creation
[1988.94 → 1990.84] And then Peter writes
[1990.84 → 1992.18] They deliberately forget
[1992.18 → 1993.82] That long ago by God's word
[1993.82 → 1995.18] The heaven came into being
[1995.18 → 1997.02] And earth was formed out of water
[1997.02 → 1998.16] And by water
[1998.16 → 2000.42] And by these waters also
[2000.42 → 2001.66] The world at that time
[2001.66 → 2003.78] Was deluged and destroyed
[2003.78 → 2005.30] So Peter brings out the flood
[2005.30 → 2007.34] And then later he says this
[2007.34 → 2009.36] Do not forget this one thing
[2009.36 → 2010.36] With the Lord
[2010.36 → 2013.16] A day is like a thousand years
[2013.16 → 2016.16] And a thousand years is like a day
[2016.16 → 2019.56] Okay I want to start today
[2019.56 → 2022.34] With one of the most powerful forces
[2022.34 → 2023.42] In your life
[2023.42 → 2025.36] And in my life
[2025.36 → 2026.38] And I mean here
[2026.38 → 2027.68] The force of habits
[2027.68 → 2031.92] If you are like most people
[2031.92 → 2033.70] Then you likely get up
[2033.70 → 2035.62] At roughly the same time every morning
[2035.62 → 2037.96] And you eat your meals
[2037.96 → 2039.46] At roughly the same time
[2039.46 → 2040.44] Day after day
[2040.44 → 2043.26] You may go to work
[2043.26 → 2045.04] The same way every day
[2045.04 → 2046.90] And then go through the same routines
[2046.90 → 2048.48] Of work once you get there
[2048.48 → 2051.42] Every week looks sort of the same
[2051.42 → 2052.50] As the week before
[2052.50 → 2055.92] We fall into these patterns of living
[2055.92 → 2059.64] Relationships too
[2059.64 → 2061.52] They can become kind of part
[2061.52 → 2063.04] Of a regular routine
[2063.04 → 2065.46] So you begin the day
[2065.46 → 2066.96] By having breakfast together
[2066.96 → 2068.32] Eggs and toast
[2068.32 → 2069.86] And some coffee most days
[2069.86 → 2071.82] And then at the end of the day
[2071.82 → 2073.30] You share your supper
[2073.30 → 2076.36] And maybe watch CBC News
[2076.36 → 2077.42] Or something like that
[2077.42 → 2079.40] You know for years
[2079.40 → 2081.00] My mother and father
[2081.00 → 2081.96] When they were still living
[2081.96 → 2084.00] For years they would watch
[2084.00 → 2085.44] Wheel of Fortune
[2085.44 → 2086.64] And Jeopardy
[2086.64 → 2088.72] Every night after supper
[2088.72 → 2090.52] It was the force of habit
[2090.52 → 2091.58] In their lives
[2091.58 → 2095.06] I once heard that some married couples
[2095.06 → 2096.06] Have the same argument
[2096.06 → 2097.22] Over and over again
[2097.22 → 2099.88] The issues might change
[2099.88 → 2101.98] But the basic argument
[2101.98 → 2103.04] Is always the same
[2103.04 → 2104.78] You know who's the boss
[2104.78 → 2105.26] You know
[2105.26 → 2107.38] And yet
[2107.38 → 2109.52] In some cases
[2109.52 → 2110.66] To my surprise
[2110.66 → 2113.64] They both still adore each other
[2113.64 → 2116.58] Now it's not like we want
[2116.58 → 2118.50] To be stuck in habit
[2118.50 → 2120.34] Some of us at least
[2120.34 → 2121.26] Would you know
[2121.26 → 2122.22] Really like to be
[2122.22 → 2123.26] Kind of creative
[2123.26 → 2124.60] And original
[2124.60 → 2126.44] And spontaneous
[2126.44 → 2128.64] Every day would be like
[2128.64 → 2130.72] One brave step
[2130.72 → 2133.18] Into the great wide blue
[2133.18 → 2133.76] You know
[2133.76 → 2135.54] We would invent every day
[2135.54 → 2136.48] From scratch
[2136.48 → 2138.76] Or maybe not
[2138.76 → 2140.30] It does sound like
[2140.30 → 2141.02] An awful lot
[2141.02 → 2142.06] Too much really
[2142.06 → 2143.28] Too much thinking
[2143.28 → 2145.28] Too much deciding
[2145.28 → 2147.04] So it's easier
[2147.04 → 2148.08] To just become
[2148.08 → 2149.82] Creatures of habit
[2149.82 → 2150.76] You know
[2150.76 → 2151.66] I don't remember much
[2151.66 → 2152.22] About my
[2152.22 → 2154.26] High school physics
[2154.26 → 2156.42] It was a long time ago
[2156.42 → 2157.44] And
[2157.44 → 2160.04] And that was the only physics
[2160.04 → 2160.82] I ever took
[2160.82 → 2162.88] But I have some memory
[2162.88 → 2164.88] Of something called inertia
[2164.88 → 2166.44] And inertia means
[2166.44 → 2168.22] That objects at rest
[2168.22 → 2169.78] Tend to stay at rest
[2169.78 → 2171.82] And objects in motion
[2171.82 → 2173.90] Tend to stay in motion
[2173.90 → 2174.82] Unless they're
[2174.82 → 2175.56] You know
[2175.56 → 2176.16] Counteractive
[2176.16 → 2176.58] Or some
[2176.58 → 2177.40] Countervailing force
[2177.40 → 2178.18] Something like that
[2178.18 → 2179.48] And it occurs to me
[2179.48 → 2180.56] That's not only true
[2180.56 → 2181.28] In physics
[2181.28 → 2182.94] Our lives
[2182.94 → 2183.72] Can show
[2183.72 → 2185.98] Show signs of inertia
[2185.98 → 2186.98] We just keep
[2186.98 → 2189.14] Doing what we did before
[2189.14 → 2190.20] Whether it's resting
[2190.20 → 2191.06] Or moving
[2191.06 → 2193.14] Now
[2193.14 → 2197.94] This kind of force of habit
[2197.94 → 2199.00] This kind of inertia
[2199.00 → 2200.46] It can be harmless
[2200.46 → 2202.38] Most of the time it is
[2202.38 → 2204.46] But not always
[2204.46 → 2205.98] We can get used to things
[2205.98 → 2208.44] We really shouldn't get used to
[2208.44 → 2209.24] You know
[2209.24 → 2210.00] Back in the day
[2210.00 → 2211.32] When I was small
[2211.32 → 2213.64] We would drive in cars
[2213.64 → 2214.70] Without seat belts
[2214.70 → 2216.52] And go out in boats
[2216.52 → 2217.68] Without life jackets
[2217.68 → 2219.24] And not worry about things
[2219.24 → 2221.18] Like bicycle helmets
[2221.18 → 2223.48] And fire alarms
[2223.48 → 2225.74] And shots for the dog
[2225.74 → 2227.42] I mean everything was fine
[2227.42 → 2229.74] We weren't in any kind of danger
[2229.74 → 2231.44] So why should we worry
[2231.44 → 2233.02] About all these new
[2233.02 → 2235.20] Safety first rules
[2235.20 → 2235.86] You know
[2235.86 → 2237.56] Everything's going alright
[2237.56 → 2240.36] So why bother
[2240.36 → 2242.56] You know
[2242.56 → 2243.76] Financial institutions
[2243.76 → 2245.10] Financial advisors
[2245.10 → 2246.60] They sometimes worry
[2246.60 → 2247.62] About getting caught up
[2247.62 → 2249.34] In these financial bubbles
[2249.34 → 2249.74] You know
[2249.74 → 2250.60] When your investments
[2250.60 → 2251.44] Are going up
[2251.44 → 2252.80] 10 and 15 percent
[2252.80 → 2253.50] For a year
[2253.50 → 2255.08] Maybe for two
[2255.08 → 2255.54] Or three
[2255.54 → 2256.36] And you know
[2256.36 → 2257.50] Eventually this bubble
[2257.50 → 2258.58] Begins to look like
[2258.58 → 2259.74] Something permanent
[2259.74 → 2262.58] It's like a force of habit
[2262.58 → 2264.20] In the financial market
[2264.20 → 2265.86] So then people start
[2265.86 → 2266.88] Investing in it
[2266.88 → 2268.32] Like it's going to be permanent
[2268.32 → 2270.04] Like this will never
[2270.04 → 2270.94] End
[2270.94 → 2274.12] And then one day
[2274.12 → 2275.10] That bubble
[2275.10 → 2276.76] Doesn't rise anymore
[2276.76 → 2278.64] It stalls
[2278.64 → 2280.36] And then it trembles
[2280.36 → 2281.24] And then it begins
[2281.24 → 2282.32] To cave in
[2282.32 → 2283.96] And people lose money
[2283.96 → 2285.16] And sometimes it's money
[2285.16 → 2286.06] That they borrowed
[2286.06 → 2287.94] And it hardly seems fair
[2287.94 → 2289.04] This was never supposed
[2289.04 → 2289.70] To happen
[2289.70 → 2292.80] Until it did
[2292.80 → 2295.96] And then there's this
[2295.96 → 2297.52] The force of habit
[2297.52 → 2300.84] Can make things look okay
[2300.84 → 2302.76] When they're not
[2302.76 → 2305.08] You know
[2305.08 → 2307.20] Racism was once okay
[2307.20 → 2308.90] Even among respected
[2308.90 → 2310.70] Church-going people
[2310.70 → 2312.20] You know
[2312.20 → 2313.40] Domestic violence
[2313.40 → 2315.26] Well not in every house
[2315.26 → 2316.78] But in some
[2316.78 → 2319.60] And nobody worried about it
[2319.60 → 2320.26] Too much
[2320.26 → 2321.90] Except for the victims
[2321.90 → 2323.44] You just minded
[2323.44 → 2324.82] Your own business
[2324.82 → 2328.54] Drunk driving
[2328.54 → 2329.48] Well that's something
[2329.48 → 2330.88] Boys do on weekends
[2330.88 → 2334.30] So what do we call that?
[2334.38 → 2335.96] It's a kind of inertia
[2335.96 → 2338.66] Like a moral inertia
[2338.66 → 2342.48] Well in our reading
[2342.48 → 2343.32] We hear about people
[2343.32 → 2344.16] Who assumed
[2344.16 → 2344.84] That the world
[2344.84 → 2345.70] Would go on
[2345.70 → 2347.68] Like it always had
[2347.68 → 2349.04] And they thought
[2349.04 → 2349.82] It was silly
[2349.82 → 2350.88] To think otherwise
[2350.88 → 2352.08] You know
[2352.08 → 2353.14] Peter called them
[2353.14 → 2354.32] The scoffers
[2354.32 → 2355.76] The scoffers
[2355.76 → 2356.86] They watched
[2356.86 → 2357.84] These Christians
[2357.84 → 2359.36] Waiting for the end
[2359.36 → 2360.20] When the world
[2360.20 → 2361.24] As we know it
[2361.24 → 2362.54] Would stop
[2362.54 → 2364.48] And Jesus himself
[2364.48 → 2365.18] Would return
[2365.18 → 2365.96] In glory
[2365.96 → 2366.78] And in power
[2366.78 → 2367.90] To judge the living
[2367.90 → 2368.58] And the dead
[2368.58 → 2370.14] And the scoffers
[2370.14 → 2373.04] They scoffed
[2373.04 → 2374.56] It's never going to happen
[2374.56 → 2376.52] It's ridiculous
[2376.52 → 2378.94] And so Peter says
[2378.94 → 2380.28] You must understand
[2380.28 → 2381.38] Now he's writing to people
[2381.38 → 2383.10] Who might be shaken
[2383.10 → 2384.78] By that kind of scoffing
[2384.78 → 2385.44] He says
[2385.44 → 2386.84] You must understand
[2386.84 → 2388.06] That in the last days
[2388.06 → 2389.48] Scoffers will come
[2389.48 → 2390.84] Scoffing and following
[2390.84 → 2391.88] Their own desires
[2391.88 → 2392.56] They will say
[2392.56 → 2394.34] Where is this coming
[2394.34 → 2395.50] That he promised
[2395.50 → 2397.46] Ever since our ancestors
[2397.46 → 2397.92] Died
[2397.92 → 2399.48] Everything goes on
[2399.48 → 2400.48] Since the beginning
[2400.48 → 2401.64] Of creation
[2401.64 → 2403.08] And then
[2403.08 → 2404.44] Peter shows
[2404.44 → 2405.62] How these scoffers
[2405.62 → 2406.66] Got it wrong
[2406.66 → 2407.84] He said
[2407.84 → 2409.64] God is not slow
[2409.64 → 2412.02] Actually
[2412.02 → 2413.90] God is waiting
[2413.90 → 2415.98] He's being patient
[2415.98 → 2418.22] He's giving the scoffers
[2418.22 → 2418.98] And their friends
[2418.98 → 2419.58] Time
[2419.58 → 2421.40] To change their minds
[2421.40 → 2422.92] And change their hearts
[2422.92 → 2424.14] And be saved
[2424.14 → 2424.76] From the end
[2424.76 → 2426.46] God may look slow
[2426.46 → 2427.46] But he's not
[2427.46 → 2430.04] He's waiting
[2430.04 → 2432.96] Just be warned
[2432.96 → 2434.72] The waiting
[2434.72 → 2436.26] It won't last forever
[2436.26 → 2439.94] You know
[2439.94 → 2440.76] Peter compares
[2440.76 → 2441.70] Our time now
[2441.70 → 2442.16] To
[2442.16 → 2443.80] The time
[2443.80 → 2445.04] Before the great flood
[2445.04 → 2446.32] In the days of Noah
[2446.32 → 2447.08] And that story
[2447.08 → 2448.40] Is told early on
[2448.40 → 2448.98] In the book of
[2448.98 → 2449.72] Genesis
[2449.72 → 2450.80] The beginning of the Bible
[2450.80 → 2452.96] Remember
[2452.96 → 2453.62] Remember says Peter
[2453.62 → 2455.00] That by God's word
[2455.00 → 2456.44] The heavens existed
[2456.44 → 2457.46] And the earth
[2457.46 → 2458.90] Was formed out of water
[2458.90 → 2459.86] And by water
[2459.86 → 2462.28] And that by these waters
[2462.28 → 2464.94] The world was deluged
[2464.94 → 2466.06] And destroyed
[2466.06 → 2468.54] And here's the point
[2468.54 → 2470.52] Before the flood
[2470.52 → 2472.64] People could not imagine
[2472.64 → 2474.78] Rain falling from the sky
[2474.78 → 2476.78] For 40 days
[2476.78 → 2477.88] And 40 nights
[2477.88 → 2479.62] They couldn't imagine
[2479.62 → 2481.18] The great deeps
[2481.18 → 2482.44] Bursting forth
[2482.44 → 2484.54] And the gates of heaven
[2484.54 → 2485.78] The floodgates of heaven
[2485.78 → 2486.84] Opening wide
[2486.84 → 2489.52] It was inconceivable to them
[2489.52 → 2491.02] That their world
[2491.02 → 2493.48] Would be covered in water
[2493.48 → 2496.36] And if anybody believed it
[2496.36 → 2498.64] And actually prepared
[2498.64 → 2500.44] An emergency kit for it
[2500.44 → 2502.56] They'd call that silly
[2502.56 → 2505.40] Well it turned out
[2505.40 → 2506.34] That somebody
[2506.34 → 2507.34] Did prepare
[2507.34 → 2509.22] For this great flood
[2509.22 → 2510.84] God warned him
[2510.84 → 2511.52] About it
[2511.52 → 2513.88] And he built himself
[2513.88 → 2514.90] And he prepared
[2514.90 → 2516.12] Noah built an ark
[2516.12 → 2517.76] A great ark
[2517.76 → 2518.68] And he
[2518.68 → 2519.78] Big enough for
[2519.78 → 2521.22] Every animal
[2521.22 → 2522.72] After its kind
[2522.72 → 2524.00] He spent
[2524.00 → 2525.52] Long years
[2525.52 → 2526.38] Getting ready
[2526.38 → 2527.82] To save the world
[2527.82 → 2528.40] From this
[2528.40 → 2529.78] This great drowning
[2529.78 → 2531.08] And he did it
[2531.08 → 2531.94] When nobody else
[2531.94 → 2532.50] In the neighbourhood
[2532.50 → 2533.58] Thought it was a threat
[2533.58 → 2535.38] They couldn't believe
[2535.38 → 2536.50] There was any danger
[2536.50 → 2538.98] They laughed at the idea
[2538.98 → 2541.44] You know that ark
[2541.44 → 2543.34] Was such a silly piece
[2543.34 → 2544.18] It's the kind of thing
[2544.18 → 2545.66] You'd take your in-laws
[2545.66 → 2546.78] To see when they came
[2546.78 → 2547.44] To visit
[2547.44 → 2549.30] And you'd walk past
[2549.30 → 2550.28] And they'd stare
[2550.28 → 2553.22] And make a joke of it
[2553.22 → 2555.38] If they had t-shirts
[2555.38 → 2556.26] In those days
[2556.26 → 2557.28] There'd be a booth
[2557.28 → 2558.16] Across the road
[2558.16 → 2558.92] With t-shirts
[2558.92 → 2560.06] And the teachers
[2560.06 → 2560.70] Would say
[2560.70 → 2562.18] I saw the boat
[2562.18 → 2563.28] But I didn't see
[2563.28 → 2563.96] Any water
[2563.96 → 2566.16] You know nowadays
[2566.16 → 2566.98] We might wonder
[2566.98 → 2567.58] If there's something
[2567.58 → 2568.40] Else going on
[2568.40 → 2568.94] Like this is
[2568.94 → 2570.04] One of those
[2570.04 → 2571.98] Pieces of government
[2571.98 → 2572.58] Pork
[2572.58 → 2573.04] You know
[2573.04 → 2574.48] Some favour
[2574.48 → 2576.54] To a cabinet minister
[2576.54 → 2577.78] Or something like that
[2577.78 → 2579.44] Like a road to nowhere
[2579.44 → 2580.58] Or something like that
[2580.58 → 2583.54] Or maybe a way to swing
[2583.54 → 2584.88] The vote
[2584.88 → 2586.24] In a close election
[2586.24 → 2589.14] The scoffers
[2589.14 → 2589.96] Were scoffing
[2589.96 → 2591.04] For months
[2591.04 → 2592.30] And for years
[2592.30 → 2594.24] And why not?
[2595.24 → 2596.70] Scoffing is fun
[2596.70 → 2599.66] And scoffing is easy
[2599.66 → 2601.26] Because everybody
[2601.26 → 2602.58] Is doing it
[2602.58 → 2605.22] And if everybody
[2605.22 → 2606.70] Thinks that the
[2606.70 → 2608.38] Ark is a joke
[2608.38 → 2609.80] Yeah then it is a joke
[2609.80 → 2612.16] And if nobody believes
[2612.16 → 2613.00] That there's going to be
[2613.00 → 2614.52] This great flood
[2614.52 → 2615.82] Then there isn't going
[2615.82 → 2616.82] To be a great flood
[2616.82 → 2617.50] And we don't have
[2617.50 → 2618.48] To worry about it
[2618.48 → 2619.92] And if everybody
[2619.92 → 2621.26] Laughs at the idea
[2621.26 → 2622.26] That this world
[2622.26 → 2623.32] Is going to end
[2623.32 → 2624.20] And that we need
[2624.20 → 2625.00] To repent
[2625.00 → 2626.12] Then the world
[2626.12 → 2627.18] Is not going to end
[2627.18 → 2628.08] And we don't need
[2628.08 → 2628.64] To repent
[2628.64 → 2630.44] So don't worry
[2630.44 → 2632.12] It's not going to happen
[2632.12 → 2636.88] Until it does
[2636.88 → 2640.14] And one day
[2640.14 → 2641.64] That great work
[2641.64 → 2642.68] Of building the Ark
[2642.68 → 2643.44] Was finished
[2643.44 → 2644.76] And soon after
[2644.76 → 2646.50] Noah disappeared
[2646.50 → 2648.40] Along with his wife
[2648.40 → 2650.10] And his children
[2650.10 → 2652.16] Obviously into the Ark
[2652.16 → 2653.76] And then the rain
[2653.76 → 2654.74] Started to fell
[2654.74 → 2656.34] It fell through
[2656.34 → 2657.16] It fell through
[2657.16 → 2657.86] A whole day
[2657.86 → 2659.52] And all through
[2659.52 → 2660.34] The next day
[2660.34 → 2661.26] And the day after
[2661.26 → 2662.44] And on and on
[2662.44 → 2663.24] The ground
[2663.24 → 2665.30] Became saturated
[2665.30 → 2666.94] Puddles grew
[2666.94 → 2667.98] Into lakes
[2667.98 → 2670.14] And then oh boy
[2670.14 → 2671.08] It got really
[2671.08 → 2671.78] Really deep
[2671.78 → 2673.36] And then
[2673.36 → 2674.62] The old jokes
[2674.62 → 2675.58] Weren't so funny
[2675.58 → 2676.18] Anymore
[2676.18 → 2677.36] And you know
[2677.36 → 2679.08] Noah didn't look
[2679.08 → 2681.18] Like such a weird guy
[2681.18 → 2683.50] And that Ark
[2683.50 → 2683.96] And that Ark began
[2683.96 → 2684.44] To look
[2684.44 → 2685.90] Well kind of
[2685.90 → 2687.18] Inspired
[2687.18 → 2688.68] Like something
[2688.68 → 2690.00] From God
[2690.00 → 2691.58] And they told
[2691.58 → 2691.96] Each other
[2691.96 → 2692.92] God's way
[2692.92 → 2693.90] Of saving us
[2693.90 → 2694.96] From this
[2694.96 → 2696.22] Was right here
[2696.22 → 2697.56] In our faces
[2697.56 → 2698.94] And we made
[2698.94 → 2699.78] Jokes
[2699.78 → 2701.28] We laughed
[2701.28 → 2703.94] Peter says
[2703.94 → 2704.70] Don't let the
[2704.70 → 2705.28] Scoffers
[2705.28 → 2706.54] Change your mind
[2706.54 → 2707.92] Don't be
[2707.92 → 2708.74] Intimidated
[2708.74 → 2709.44] By their jokes
[2709.44 → 2710.06] Don't let
[2710.06 → 2711.28] Their sneering
[2711.28 → 2711.88] And their
[2711.88 → 2712.66] Snickering
[2712.66 → 2713.66] Make you lose
[2713.66 → 2714.98] Sight of God's
[2714.98 → 2715.30] Future
[2715.30 → 2716.16] The scoffers
[2716.16 → 2717.06] Were wrong
[2717.06 → 2718.02] Before the flood
[2718.02 → 2719.16] And they paid
[2719.16 → 2719.62] Their price
[2719.62 → 2720.30] And now you're
[2720.30 → 2721.26] Waiting for Jesus
[2721.26 → 2722.52] And the scoffers
[2722.52 → 2723.20] Will have their
[2723.20 → 2723.92] Own opinions
[2723.92 → 2724.68] And they won't
[2724.68 → 2725.22] Be afraid
[2725.22 → 2726.22] To share them
[2726.22 → 2727.96] Be careful
[2727.96 → 2729.98] The day
[2729.98 → 2730.82] Of judgment
[2730.82 → 2731.76] Is coming
[2731.76 → 2733.46] Don't laugh
[2733.46 → 2735.10] It's real
[2735.10 → 2737.12] It's coming
[2737.12 → 2741.24] And if this
[2741.24 → 2742.48] Return of Jesus
[2742.48 → 2744.06] Feels too long
[2744.06 → 2744.36] Then
[2744.36 → 2747.10] Remember God's
[2747.10 → 2747.82] Nature
[2747.82 → 2749.70] And his being
[2749.70 → 2750.86] God is not
[2750.86 → 2751.72] Like us
[2751.72 → 2752.10] I mean he's
[2752.10 → 2752.96] Often described
[2752.96 → 2754.22] Using human language
[2754.22 → 2754.78] You know he has
[2754.78 → 2755.92] Hands and feet
[2755.92 → 2756.72] And a voice
[2756.72 → 2758.16] And so on
[2758.16 → 2759.74] But those are
[2759.74 → 2760.74] Just word pictures
[2760.74 → 2762.02] To help us
[2762.02 → 2763.20] Understand him
[2763.20 → 2763.74] A bit
[2763.74 → 2765.12] But he is
[2765.12 → 2766.20] The holy other
[2766.20 → 2767.48] He is entirely
[2767.48 → 2768.20] Different
[2768.20 → 2769.36] And one of the
[2769.36 → 2770.10] Big ways
[2770.10 → 2771.04] He's entirely
[2771.04 → 2771.72] Different
[2771.72 → 2773.10] Is his
[2773.10 → 2774.56] Sense of time
[2774.56 → 2776.26] A thousand
[2776.26 → 2777.30] Years are like
[2777.30 → 2777.86] A day
[2777.86 → 2778.76] And a day
[2778.76 → 2779.22] Is like
[2779.22 → 2780.18] A thousand years
[2780.18 → 2781.08] He doesn't
[2781.08 → 2782.12] Live in our
[2782.12 → 2783.94] Minute by minute
[2783.94 → 2784.78] Hour by hour
[2784.78 → 2785.76] Day by day
[2785.76 → 2786.78] Year by year
[2786.78 → 2787.76] That frame
[2787.76 → 2788.40] Of time
[2788.40 → 2789.80] It's different
[2789.80 → 2791.98] I don't know
[2791.98 → 2792.34] If you ever
[2792.34 → 2792.82] Had a chance
[2792.82 → 2793.36] To read those
[2793.36 → 2794.78] Those Narnia books
[2794.78 → 2795.82] By C.S. Lewis
[2795.82 → 2796.78] I mean they're
[2796.78 → 2797.22] Actually written
[2797.22 → 2797.98] For children
[2797.98 → 2799.74] I did not
[2799.74 → 2800.42] Discover them
[2800.42 → 2801.06] Until I was
[2801.06 → 2801.76] In university
[2801.76 → 2803.06] And then I
[2803.06 → 2803.78] Consumed them
[2803.78 → 2804.38] They were wonderful
[2804.38 → 2805.86] And C.S. Lewis
[2805.86 → 2806.38] Does a lot
[2806.38 → 2807.14] With that sense
[2807.14 → 2808.98] That God's time
[2808.98 → 2810.20] Is very different
[2810.20 → 2810.72] From ours
[2810.72 → 2811.70] Now Narnia
[2811.70 → 2813.34] Is that other
[2813.34 → 2813.96] World
[2813.96 → 2814.46] That would
[2814.46 → 2814.86] Sort of
[2814.86 → 2815.68] Stand for
[2815.68 → 2816.52] This
[2816.52 → 2817.78] For God's
[2817.78 → 2818.12] World
[2818.12 → 2819.04] And these
[2819.04 → 2819.54] Children
[2819.54 → 2820.84] Leave our
[2820.84 → 2821.24] World
[2821.24 → 2821.64] And go
[2821.64 → 2822.52] Into Narnia
[2822.52 → 2823.24] And they
[2823.24 → 2823.68] Have these
[2823.68 → 2824.60] Great adventures
[2824.60 → 2825.44] And engage
[2825.44 → 2825.88] In great
[2825.88 → 2826.46] Battles
[2826.46 → 2827.12] Against all
[2827.12 → 2827.58] Kinds of
[2827.58 → 2827.86] Wicked
[2827.86 → 2828.32] Forces
[2828.32 → 2829.14] And then
[2829.14 → 2829.48] They come
[2829.48 → 2829.96] Back into
[2829.96 → 2830.64] Our world
[2830.64 → 2831.80] And no
[2831.80 → 2832.34] Time has
[2832.34 → 2832.72] Passed
[2832.72 → 2833.26] At all
[2833.26 → 2836.50] And it's
[2836.50 → 2836.82] His way
[2836.82 → 2837.16] Of kind
[2837.16 → 2838.02] Of communicating
[2838.02 → 2838.40] This
[2838.40 → 2838.92] The sense
[2838.92 → 2839.24] Of the
[2839.24 → 2840.30] Otherness
[2840.30 → 2841.86] You know
[2841.86 → 2842.24] The prophet
[2842.24 → 2842.64] Isaiah
[2842.64 → 2843.10] Said that
[2843.10 → 2843.82] God is
[2843.82 → 2844.56] Enthroned
[2844.56 → 2844.94] Over the
[2844.94 → 2845.26] Circle
[2845.26 → 2845.62] Of the
[2845.62 → 2845.98] Earth
[2845.98 → 2846.74] That all
[2846.74 → 2847.28] The nations
[2847.28 → 2847.78] Are like
[2847.78 → 2848.34] A drop
[2848.34 → 2848.70] In the
[2848.70 → 2849.00] Bucket
[2849.00 → 2849.60] That no
[2849.60 → 2849.84] One
[2849.84 → 2850.52] Can compare
[2850.52 → 2850.90] To him
[2850.90 → 2851.48] That no
[2851.48 → 2851.84] One
[2851.84 → 2852.42] Is his
[2852.42 → 2852.92] Equal
[2852.92 → 2853.60] God's
[2853.60 → 2853.82] Ways
[2853.82 → 2854.36] Are so
[2854.36 → 2854.64] Much
[2854.64 → 2854.92] Higher
[2854.92 → 2855.40] Than our
[2855.40 → 2855.72] Ways
[2855.72 → 2856.38] And his
[2856.38 → 2856.74] Thoughts
[2856.74 → 2857.36] Are so
[2857.36 → 2857.64] Much
[2857.64 → 2858.00] Higher
[2858.00 → 2859.00] Than our
[2859.00 → 2859.32] Thoughts
[2859.32 → 2859.46] So
[2859.46 → 2860.50] Obviously
[2860.50 → 2860.86] His
[2860.86 → 2861.66] Experience
[2861.66 → 2862.62] Of time
[2862.62 → 2863.40] Is different
[2863.40 → 2863.82] For him
[2863.82 → 2864.92] A thousand
[2864.92 → 2865.56] Years
[2865.56 → 2866.36] Is like
[2866.36 → 2866.90] A bit
[2866.90 → 2867.44] Of morning
[2867.44 → 2867.92] Mist
[2867.92 → 2868.58] And a
[2868.58 → 2869.10] Lifetime
[2869.10 → 2869.62] Of waiting
[2869.62 → 2870.42] For us
[2870.42 → 2872.14] Is like
[2872.14 → 2873.02] Just a
[2873.02 → 2873.50] Whisper
[2873.50 → 2874.10] Of time
[2874.10 → 2874.90] For God
[2874.90 → 2877.02] Now those
[2877.02 → 2877.76] Years that
[2877.76 → 2878.50] Have passed
[2878.50 → 2880.10] Since Jesus
[2880.10 → 2880.66] Was a
[2880.66 → 2881.92] Baby in
[2881.92 → 2882.80] Bethlehem
[2882.80 → 2883.34] And a
[2883.34 → 2884.04] Young boy
[2884.04 → 2885.06] In Nazareth
[2885.06 → 2885.66] And then a
[2885.66 → 2886.12] Preacher
[2886.12 → 2886.82] And teacher
[2886.82 → 2887.64] And healer
[2887.64 → 2888.40] In Galilee
[2888.40 → 2888.78] Who was
[2888.78 → 2889.36] Eventually
[2889.36 → 2890.48] Arrested
[2890.48 → 2891.28] In Jerusalem
[2891.28 → 2892.22] And condemned
[2892.22 → 2893.00] And crucified
[2893.00 → 2894.12] And then
[2894.12 → 2894.62] Raised
[2894.62 → 2894.90] Again
[2894.90 → 2895.50] To life
[2895.50 → 2896.10] I mean
[2896.10 → 2896.30] That
[2896.30 → 2897.10] That does
[2897.10 → 2897.56] Feel like
[2897.56 → 2898.00] A long
[2898.00 → 2898.78] Time ago
[2898.78 → 2899.28] Doesn't
[2899.28 → 2899.54] It
[2899.54 → 2901.00] And we
[2901.00 → 2901.60] Know from
[2901.60 → 2902.02] The New
[2902.02 → 2902.48] Testament
[2902.48 → 2903.94] That many
[2903.94 → 2904.72] Christians
[2904.72 → 2905.58] In that
[2905.58 → 2905.94] Time
[2905.94 → 2906.22] In the
[2906.22 → 2906.46] Years
[2906.46 → 2906.80] After
[2906.80 → 2907.24] Jesus
[2907.24 → 2907.92] They
[2907.92 → 2908.46] They
[2908.46 → 2908.86] Believe
[2908.86 → 2909.54] That they
[2909.54 → 2910.18] Would see
[2910.18 → 2910.50] Him
[2910.50 → 2910.90] Coming
[2910.90 → 2911.38] Back
[2911.38 → 2912.00] In
[2912.00 → 2912.50] Their
[2912.50 → 2913.04] Own
[2913.04 → 2914.26] Lifetimes
[2914.26 → 2915.02] Before
[2915.02 → 2915.30] They
[2915.30 → 2915.72] Died
[2915.72 → 2917.44] But it
[2917.44 → 2917.80] Didn't
[2917.80 → 2918.34] Happen
[2918.34 → 2920.44] Those
[2920.44 → 2920.74] First
[2920.74 → 2921.26] Christians
[2921.26 → 2921.70] Grew
[2921.70 → 2922.28] Old
[2922.28 → 2923.60] And they
[2923.60 → 2923.90] Became
[2923.90 → 2924.38] Grey
[2924.38 → 2926.18] And then
[2926.18 → 2926.32] They
[2926.32 → 2926.66] Became
[2926.66 → 2927.30] Stooped
[2927.30 → 2927.78] And weary
[2927.78 → 2929.76] And eventually
[2929.76 → 2930.64] They passed
[2930.64 → 2931.14] And their
[2931.14 → 2931.72] Sons and
[2931.72 → 2932.08] Daughters
[2932.08 → 2932.86] After them
[2932.86 → 2933.14] Grew
[2933.14 → 2933.78] Old
[2933.78 → 2934.70] And they
[2934.70 → 2935.12] Became
[2935.12 → 2935.64] Grey
[2935.64 → 2936.84] And stooped
[2936.84 → 2937.76] And frail
[2937.76 → 2939.04] And eventually
[2939.04 → 2939.92] Their families
[2939.92 → 2940.60] Came together
[2940.60 → 2941.18] To give their
[2941.18 → 2942.32] Last goodbyes
[2942.32 → 2943.58] And so
[2943.58 → 2944.02] It went
[2944.02 → 2944.70] On to
[2944.70 → 2945.60] The children's
[2945.60 → 2946.04] Children
[2946.04 → 2947.08] From generation
[2947.08 → 2948.28] After generation
[2948.28 → 2949.68] The little
[2949.68 → 2950.74] Girls and
[2950.74 → 2951.40] Boys with
[2951.40 → 2951.86] The two
[2951.86 → 2952.60] Front teeth
[2952.60 → 2953.18] Missing
[2953.18 → 2954.62] They became
[2954.62 → 2956.40] White haired
[2956.40 → 2956.88] People
[2956.88 → 2958.52] Waiting for
[2958.52 → 2958.98] God to
[2958.98 → 2959.34] Take them
[2959.34 → 2959.74] Home
[2959.74 → 2960.84] It happened
[2960.84 → 2961.46] Over and
[2961.46 → 2962.18] Over again
[2962.18 → 2963.78] And the
[2963.78 → 2964.74] Time adds
[2964.74 → 2965.42] Up and it
[2965.42 → 2965.88] Can feel
[2965.88 → 2966.48] Very
[2966.48 → 2967.08] Very
[2967.08 → 2967.90] Long
[2967.90 → 2970.36] But
[2970.36 → 2971.06] Says
[2971.06 → 2971.28] Peter
[2971.28 → 2971.80] Don't
[2971.80 → 2972.48] Think of
[2972.48 → 2972.84] That
[2972.84 → 2973.20] As
[2973.20 → 2974.96] Slowness
[2974.96 → 2977.26] Don't
[2977.26 → 2977.60] Think of
[2977.60 → 2977.84] That
[2977.84 → 2978.04] As
[2978.04 → 2978.84] Proof
[2978.84 → 2979.02] That
[2979.02 → 2979.14] It
[2979.14 → 2979.26] Will
[2979.26 → 2979.54] Never
[2979.54 → 2980.14] Happen
[2980.14 → 2982.04] Actually
[2982.04 → 2982.50] Something
[2982.50 → 2983.14] Very
[2983.14 → 2983.92] Different
[2983.92 → 2984.34] Is
[2984.34 → 2984.72] Going
[2984.72 → 2985.34] On
[2985.34 → 2986.22] Peter
[2986.22 → 2986.56] Says
[2986.56 → 2986.96] The
[2986.96 → 2987.30] Lord
[2987.30 → 2987.58] Is
[2987.58 → 2987.98] Not
[2987.98 → 2988.62] Slow
[2988.62 → 2989.10] In
[2989.10 → 2989.42] Keeping
[2989.42 → 2989.70] His
[2989.70 → 2990.14] Promises
[2990.14 → 2990.42] Some
[2990.42 → 2990.94] Understand
[2990.94 → 2991.42] Slowness
[2991.42 → 2991.86] He
[2991.86 → 2992.08] Is
[2992.08 → 2992.70] Patient
[2992.70 → 2993.14] With
[2993.14 → 2993.34] You
[2993.34 → 2993.94] Not
[2993.94 → 2994.38] Wanting
[2994.38 → 2995.14] Anyone
[2995.14 → 2995.42] To
[2995.42 → 2995.78] Perish
[2995.78 → 2996.04] But
[2996.04 → 2996.82] Everyone
[2996.82 → 2997.16] To
[2997.16 → 2997.36] Come
[2997.36 → 2997.56] To
[2997.56 → 2998.24] Repentance
[2998.24 → 2998.78] So
[2998.78 → 2999.40] God
[2999.40 → 3000.04] Knows
[3000.04 → 3000.44] That
[3000.44 → 3000.62] There
[3000.62 → 3000.74] Are
[3000.74 → 3001.04] People
[3001.04 → 3001.40] Who
[3001.40 → 3002.04] Need
[3002.04 → 3003.10] Time
[3003.10 → 3004.42] They
[3004.42 → 3004.58] Are
[3004.58 → 3005.44] Still
[3005.44 → 3006.42] Sheep
[3006.42 → 3006.74] That
[3006.74 → 3006.92] Are
[3006.92 → 3008.02] Lost
[3008.02 → 3008.66] Away
[3008.66 → 3008.96] From
[3008.96 → 3009.16] The
[3009.16 → 3009.46] Fold
[3009.46 → 3009.68] They
[3009.68 → 3009.76] Are
[3009.76 → 3009.94] Still
[3009.94 → 3010.56] Prodigal
[3010.56 → 3010.98] Sons
[3010.98 → 3011.26] And
[3011.26 → 3011.68] Daughters
[3011.68 → 3011.94] Who
[3011.94 → 3012.14] Need
[3012.14 → 3012.26] To
[3012.26 → 3012.46] Come
[3012.46 → 3013.32] Home
[3013.32 → 3013.64] They're
[3013.64 → 3014.36] Wasting
[3014.36 → 3014.68] Their
[3014.68 → 3015.12] Lives
[3015.12 → 3015.30] And
[3015.30 → 3015.50] They're
[3015.50 → 3015.86] In
[3015.86 → 3016.48] Serious
[3016.48 → 3016.98] Trouble
[3016.98 → 3017.58] They
[3017.58 → 3018.10] Should
[3018.10 → 3019.00] Realize
[3019.00 → 3019.26] That
[3019.26 → 3019.44] And
[3019.44 → 3019.62] Come
[3019.62 → 3019.98] Home
[3019.98 → 3020.14] To
[3020.14 → 3020.30] The
[3020.30 → 3020.72] Father
[3020.72 → 3021.56] But
[3021.56 → 3021.74] They
[3021.74 → 3022.00] Need
[3022.00 → 3022.58] Time
[3022.58 → 3024.00] And
[3024.00 → 3024.22] So
[3024.22 → 3024.66] God
[3024.66 → 3026.16] Waits
[3026.16 → 3027.24] He
[3027.24 → 3027.46] Is
[3027.46 → 3027.96] So
[3027.96 → 3028.82] Very
[3028.82 → 3029.40] Patient
[3029.40 → 3029.88] Now
[3029.88 → 3030.02] You
[3030.02 → 3030.28] Might
[3030.28 → 3030.58] Call
[3030.58 → 3030.86] That
[3030.86 → 3031.72] Slowness
[3031.72 → 3032.44] But
[3032.44 → 3032.64] We
[3032.64 → 3032.84] Should
[3032.84 → 3033.08] Be
[3033.08 → 3034.02] Grateful
[3034.02 → 3035.30] For
[3035.30 → 3035.60] That
[3035.60 → 3036.46] Slowness
[3036.46 → 3037.02] The
[3037.02 → 3037.42] World
[3037.42 → 3038.08] Needs
[3038.08 → 3038.34] It
[3038.34 → 3039.98] You
[3039.98 → 3040.22] May
[3040.22 → 3040.52] Need
[3040.52 → 3040.80] It
[3040.80 → 3043.36] You
[3043.36 → 3043.46] Know
[3043.46 → 3043.84] Every
[3043.84 → 3044.30] Day
[3044.30 → 3044.64] That
[3044.64 → 3045.44] Passes
[3045.44 → 3045.60] Is
[3045.60 → 3045.78] A
[3045.78 → 3046.12] Day
[3046.12 → 3047.08] In
[3047.08 → 3047.34] Which
[3047.34 → 3048.48] God
[3048.48 → 3048.84] Is
[3048.84 → 3049.54] Calling
[3049.54 → 3049.96] To
[3049.96 → 3050.26] You
[3050.26 → 3051.66] And
[3051.66 → 3051.92] If
[3051.92 → 3052.16] You're
[3052.16 → 3052.64] Still
[3052.64 → 3053.08] A
[3053.08 → 3053.48] Lost
[3053.48 → 3053.92] Son
[3053.92 → 3054.18] Or
[3054.18 → 3054.62] Daughter
[3054.62 → 3054.90] If
[3054.90 → 3055.08] You're
[3055.08 → 3055.44] Still
[3055.44 → 3056.06] Wasting
[3056.06 → 3056.36] The
[3056.36 → 3056.64] Gifts
[3056.64 → 3056.92] That
[3056.92 → 3057.28] God
[3057.28 → 3057.52] Has

[3222.12 → 3222.94] Unreal
[3222.94 → 3223.16] I
[3223.16 → 3223.24] Mean
[3223.24 → 3223.88] Who
[3223.88 → 3224.38] Really
[3224.38 → 3225.10] Knows
[3225.10 → 3225.36] What
[3225.36 → 3225.68] That's
[3225.68 → 3225.86] Going
[3225.86 → 3226.06] To
[3226.06 → 3226.30] Be

[3242.68 → 3242.98] That's
[3242.98 → 3243.32] Killing
[3243.32 → 3243.68] Me
[3243.68 → 3244.80] Or

[3251.80 → 3252.00] Real
[3252.00 → 3252.38] World
[3252.38 → 3255.52] The

[3255.70 → 3256.12] Thing
[3256.12 → 3257.52] Is

[3263.94 → 3264.10] It
[3264.10 → 3264.26] Will
[3264.26 → 3264.80] Happen

[3287.10 → 3287.46] Then
[3287.46 → 3287.80] More

[3324.74 → 3325.00] That

[3444.76 → 3452.74] Wipe away all tears, for the dawn draws near, and the world is about to turn.
[3455.40 → 3463.74] Though I am small, my God, my all, you work great things in me.
[3463.74 → 3472.74] And your mercy will last from the depths of the past, to the end of the age to be.
[3473.74 → 3480.74] Your Mary name puts the crown to shame, and to those who look for you yearn.

[3566.74 → 3567.94] Please be seated.
[3576.74 → 3579.80] Let's come together to our God in prayer.
[3579.80 → 3591.08] God of glory, Lord of compassion, who came to us humbly in human form, a baby.
[3591.80 → 3594.38] We are in awe of your love for us.
[3595.88 → 3599.90] Everlasting Father, how we need your light in this dark time.
[3601.20 → 3605.86] We wait in these Advent weeks for signs of your presence among us,
[3606.48 → 3608.82] which we are sometimes too blind to see.
[3609.80 → 3617.06] Lord, even in these dark days, with rain, floods, loss of homes, livestock, and livelihood,
[3617.28 → 3623.12] for family and friends not far away, we look to you for help and for strength.
[3624.12 → 3628.34] We thank you for all those who have reached out to help in so many ways.
[3629.30 → 3632.58] We ask for your guidance in the recovery period,
[3633.04 → 3636.56] and that this week's rains may not cause further devastation.
[3636.56 → 3642.30] Shine your light on Abbotsford, Sums, Merritt, Princeton,
[3642.30 → 3646.26] and other communities where destruction has left people feeling hopeless.
[3647.26 → 3649.60] Show us ways that we can be helpful.
[3649.60 → 3656.48] And although the devastation in our province is foremost in our minds because it is so close,
[3656.86 → 3661.82] it serves to remind us of those who have been living in uncertainty for decades.
[3662.70 → 3665.66] Places around the globe where war is always near.
[3666.60 → 3668.90] Where oppression looms large.
[3668.90 → 3673.38] Where both children and their parents don't remember having a home,
[3674.02 → 3677.50] but have lived in refugee camps for as long as they can remember.
[3679.30 → 3683.56] Father, surely you know the aching of our hearts for your return.
[3684.72 → 3688.58] Until that day arrives, make us beacons of help and hope.
[3688.58 → 3694.06] Today we pray for people whom we know are suffering with illness.
[3695.24 → 3700.58] We lift Joan as she and Jerry continue this long and arduous journey with cancer.
[3701.70 → 3704.58] Give comfort for both body and spirit, we pray.
[3705.52 → 3709.70] May Joan's treatments be effective and give her doctor's wisdom in this.
[3709.70 → 3714.92] We thank you along with Doug and Nancy for your grace in Doug's treatments.
[3715.96 → 3718.90] We ask that they may receive good news in due time.
[3720.24 → 3725.08] Bathe both of these couples in your presence and keep them strong in their faith.
[3726.56 → 3732.42] We bring before you Pastor Jason, Christy, and Ellie who continue to deal with the effects of COVID.
[3733.56 → 3738.38] Provide them full recovery soon and give them and their family patience
[3738.38 → 3742.98] until they are able to come back fully to their lives of work and study.
[3744.38 → 3748.82] Today we pray for Delta Christian School, which has been a large part of our history.
[3749.54 → 3752.66] We pray for the leadership and the teachers,
[3753.20 → 3756.36] that they may truly help to shape children into your image,
[3757.08 → 3762.20] imparting knowledge and character that will usher in your kingdom into this world.
[3763.74 → 3766.62] Lord of the universe, you do light our way
[3766.62 → 3768.44] and provide for all we need.
[3769.34 → 3771.40] Give us eyes to see your salvation.
[3772.42 → 3774.66] Give us lives that reflect your character,
[3775.40 → 3777.68] humility, grace, and love.
[3778.52 → 3781.50] Give us faith to believe what our eyes fail to see.
[3782.56 → 3786.62] We pray these things that your glory will be evident to all.
[3787.12 → 3788.76] And we pray them in the name of Jesus,
[3789.02 → 3791.84] our wonderful Counsellor and Prince of Peace.
[3792.50 → 3792.84] Amen.
[3792.84 → 3793.00] Amen.
[3796.62 → 3797.62] Amen.
[3797.62 → 3797.68] Amen.
[3797.68 → 3798.06] Amen.
[3802.56 → 3807.22] Could I ask you to stand please and receive God's blessing.
[3808.92 → 3813.34] People of God, may the Lord bless you and keep you,
[3813.76 → 3816.50] make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[3817.12 → 3820.34] May the Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[3820.40 → 3822.44] And all God's people say, amen.
[3822.44 → 3822.62] Amen.
[3822.62 → 3822.66] Amen.
[3822.66 → 3824.70] Amen.
[3824.70 → 3824.76] Amen.
[3824.76 → 3825.02] Amen.
[3825.02 → 3825.34] Amen.
[3825.34 → 3825.78] Amen.
[3825.78 → 3826.34] Amen.
[3826.34 → 3840.42] Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[3840.42 → 3846.10] Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[3847.16 → 3851.86] Praise Him above, ye, and below.
[3851.86 → 3864.14] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.
[3881.86 → 3883.86] Amen.
