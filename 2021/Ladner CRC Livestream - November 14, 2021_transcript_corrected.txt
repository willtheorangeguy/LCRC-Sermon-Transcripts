[0.00 → 2.00] Oh
[30.00 → 31.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 61.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 91.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 121.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 151.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 181.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 211.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 266.66] Good morning.
[266.66 → 270.78] And welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[270.78 → 271.78] My name is Jason.
[271.78 → 276.98] I'm one of the pastors here along with Nancy and I will be leading us in our worship this
[276.98 → 277.98] morning.
[277.98 → 283.66] Today is a good day because today is our Family Worship Sunday.
[283.66 → 289.62] Family Worship Sunday is when we especially welcome our brothers and sisters from the
[289.62 → 294.58] Chinese ministry, and we also welcome our children to stay in the service with us and there'll
[294.58 → 296.86] be a children's message later on.
[296.86 → 301.94] It also means that we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper together today.
[301.94 → 307.58] And so before we begin our service there are just a few announcements for us.
[307.58 → 313.58] And the first is I'm going to invite Jeff to come up and to talk about Faith Promise Giving.
[313.58 → 314.58] Good morning.
[314.58 → 328.86] Well as Jason said it's that time of year again for Faith Promise Giving.
[328.86 → 330.86] The best part of the year for the Deacons.
[330.86 → 335.54] It's kind of like Christmas.
[335.54 → 341.38] So for those who have taken part in the past we thank you, and you know the drill.
[341.38 → 345.50] But for those who are new or who have never taken part we as Deacons would like to encourage
[345.50 → 348.54] all of you to join us in this.
[348.54 → 354.10] As the Bible talks in numerous places about giving your first fruits and we as a church
[354.10 → 357.02] think this is a good way to accomplish that.
[357.02 → 361.38] We believe that planning ahead with your tithing puts more thought into it and can make it more
[361.38 → 367.78] of a priority than it being maybe a quicker afterthought.
[367.78 → 372.62] So in short Faith Promise Giving is a pledge that you are making to the church and more importantly
[372.62 → 379.94] God about how much you want to fiscally contribute to the church's operation in 2022.
[379.94 → 383.46] Let me note that this pledge is only for the operation of the church.
[383.46 → 387.90] So salaries, maintenance, local church ministries.
[387.90 → 393.96] Not for our secondary offerings like World Renew or Delta Christian.
[393.96 → 399.04] And obviously we understand if circumstances change the church won't hold you to your pledge.
[399.04 → 405.38] But it's a way for you to think and pray about your giving and how much you want to give back.
[405.38 → 410.20] So we encourage you to read your package that you got in your mailbox today.
[410.20 → 414.96] And for those watching at home we emailed you in the connections.
[414.96 → 419.58] And if you could complete these forms and bring them back to us on December 5th where a special
[419.58 → 421.74] offering will take place.
[421.74 → 424.38] Thank you.
[424.38 → 425.38] All right.
[425.38 → 431.38] Thank you, Jeff.
[431.38 → 438.00] So our designated offering for this Sunday, you know, every Sunday we have a special offering
[438.00 → 445.94] that we take that's not only for our church's operations but also for mission, for other organizations
[445.94 → 447.46] that we support.
[447.46 → 451.24] And our designated offering for this Sunday is for Reframe Ministries.
[451.24 → 452.74] It's a ministry of the CRC.
[452.74 → 460.62] And so you can give by, you know, we're still not collecting the tray, the offering bag, but
[460.62 → 465.54] there are some boxes where you can put in a check, or you can drop it off or mail it to
[465.54 → 466.06] the church.
[467.90 → 473.34] Two other quick announcements is that, as you know, on Wednesday mornings we have a coffee
[473.34 → 475.40] break Bible study for men and women.
[475.40 → 477.68] I invite everyone to come to that.
[477.68 → 479.22] We're studying the Gospel of John together.
[479.22 → 483.82] It's been a great time of studying the Word and a fellowship during the week.
[484.58 → 488.54] And also there are, there's a membership class that is coming up.
[488.82 → 493.82] We're going to be doing it on Zoom on Tuesday evenings from about 7 to 8 o'clock.
[493.92 → 494.82] It's three weeks.
[495.16 → 498.14] And this is kind of an introduction to Latin or CRC.
[498.22 → 503.68] If you want to get to know who we are as a church, if you have maybe already been baptized
[503.68 → 507.62] and you're a member, but you want to know more about our denomination and who we are,
[507.72 → 509.20] then this is a class for you.
[509.42 → 510.36] It's really for anybody.
[510.82 → 515.02] So if you'd like to join, you can sign up on the table in the foyer.
[515.28 → 517.04] Or you can just email me as well.
[518.80 → 522.66] So let's now prepare our hearts to worship God.
[522.66 → 528.42] God calls us to worship.
[528.64 → 531.10] He calls us out of our warm beds.
[531.62 → 538.60] He calls us out into this rainy weather, but into this very dry place that we can be in.
[539.10 → 539.96] And he calls us together.
[540.12 → 544.24] He calls us as a family to come before him, to seek our life in him.
[544.24 → 550.90] So our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 104, where it says,
[551.02 → 554.14] Leader, I will read, where it says, People, would you all read along with me?
[555.34 → 557.42] Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[558.36 → 560.58] O Lord, my God, you are very great.
[561.32 → 567.14] You are clothed with splendour and majesty, covering yourself with a light as with a garment,
[567.90 → 570.22] stretching out the heavens like a tent.
[570.22 → 574.60] May the people of the Lord endure forever.
[575.34 → 578.20] May the Lord rejoice in his works.
[579.20 → 582.32] I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.
[582.72 → 586.56] I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
[587.54 → 593.24] May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord.
[593.80 → 595.42] Let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[595.78 → 596.46] Let's pray together.
[596.46 → 602.58] Father, our Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning as your people.
[603.20 → 609.70] Father, we come in the joy, the freedom that we have as your children.
[610.44 → 615.76] We come before you and worship you because you are the mighty God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[616.14 → 619.26] You are robed with majesty and power and righteousness.
[620.38 → 621.66] So, Lord, we worship you.
[621.66 → 627.30] And we worship you and seek our life in you because you are the source of life.
[627.60 → 629.00] You are the source of all good things.
[629.98 → 631.84] Father, meet us now where we are.
[631.94 → 634.26] Be present by your Holy Spirit among us.
[635.06 → 637.60] And bless this time of our worship.
[637.82 → 638.96] We pray in Jesus' name.
[639.42 → 639.68] Amen.
[639.68 → 639.78] Amen.
[640.78 → 641.86] So, let's all stand.
[642.46 → 650.80] And we have a special thing happening today where some of our Chinese members will be leading us in singing the first two songs.
[650.90 → 654.64] They're going to sing first in English, the first stanza.
[654.74 → 655.84] But then they're going to switch to Mandarin.
[655.96 → 656.78] So, you're going to have to keep up.
[657.36 → 657.74] Just kidding.
[658.02 → 659.40] We're going to have the words on the screen.
[659.40 → 661.92] So, just sing their familiar song.
[662.02 → 662.60] Just sing along.
[689.40 → 719.38] And we're going to have to keep up.
[719.40 → 749.38] And we're going to have to keep up.
[749.40 → 779.38] Let's sing along.
[779.40 → 809.38] Let's sing along.
[809.40 → 839.38] Let's sing along.
[839.40 → 869.38] Let's sing along.
[869.40 → 899.38] Let's sing along.
[899.86 → 905.38] God greets us with these words from Psalm 16, verse 11.
[906.40 → 909.14] You make known to me the path of life.
[909.94 → 912.40] In your presence there is fullness of joy.
[913.12 → 916.74] At your right hand are pleasures evermore.
[916.74 → 922.74] Just as God greets us, would you turn and greet one another.
[922.74 → 927.22] Is that one?
[927.22 → 937.22] Good morning.
[937.22 → 937.24] Good morning.
[957.34 → 967.22] Compound that you for directing.

[972.36 → 979.22] You take her off by and pointing those notes.
[979.22 → 992.16] The amazing grace of singing the song,
[992.16 → 1001.30] I sing the flesh, the king,
[1001.30 → 1010.60] The love in' me, the love of Christ,

[1079.42 → 1088.42] I will not be able to live in the world.
[1088.42 → 1099.42] I will not be able to live in the world.
[1099.42 → 1111.42] It will never enough I will know the world.
[1111.42 → 1119.42] But, I will never know the reason I let you find the Cold best.

[1129.42 → 1140.42] With my son, our children happy night.
[1149.42 → 1152.78] You may be seated.
[1167.58 → 1173.92] So this is a very special day, and it's a very special time right now, because we will
[1173.92 → 1181.60] be ordaining Pastor Nancy, Nancy Young, to her position as commissioned pastor in the
[1181.60 → 1182.18] CRC.
[1182.76 → 1183.76] So come on up, Nancy.
[1186.38 → 1193.00] And so we especially today rejoice in Christ's love for his church, because we have this great
[1193.00 → 1194.32] privilege of ordaining Nancy.
[1195.32 → 1203.32] You know, all baptized believers are called to love God, to serve God, and to follow our
[1203.32 → 1204.32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1205.10 → 1210.66] But as the Lord of the church, Jesus also appoints certain people to be leaders and shepherds
[1210.66 → 1211.86] of his people.
[1212.44 → 1218.88] And then by his Holy Spirit, he equips them with all the spiritual gifts that they need
[1218.88 → 1221.80] in order to carry out the ministry that he calls them to.
[1221.80 → 1232.70] We believe that Nancy has, that God has gifted her with gifts for ministry, and we have called
[1232.70 → 1239.12] her to serve as the associate pastor for Chinese ministry at Later Christian Reformed Church.
[1239.62 → 1245.40] So we have extended this call to Nancy, and she has also successfully sustained an examination
[1245.40 → 1251.42] by our classes, BC Southeast, of the Christian Reformed Church just last month.
[1251.82 → 1252.82] She did amazingly.
[1253.00 → 1258.54] Everyone was just so blessed by her answers, and it was amazing.
[1258.64 → 1260.32] Everyone has so many great things to say.
[1260.32 → 1268.82] And so, it is therefore my honour to present our sister in Christ, Nancy Young, for ordination
[1268.82 → 1270.08] as commission pastor.
[1271.42 → 1278.92] In varying ways, every commission pastor is a servant both of Christ and of the church,
[1279.72 → 1287.32] a steward in the household of God, a teacher to explain the mysteries of the faith, a shepherd
[1287.32 → 1293.28] who cares for the flock, and an ambassador and a herald of our king, proclaiming the message
[1293.28 → 1293.90] of the gospel.
[1295.24 → 1301.64] As our associate pastor for Chinese ministry, Nancy will have the privilege and the responsibility
[1301.64 → 1309.20] of extending pastoral care, of preaching God's word, of officiating the sacraments when
[1309.20 → 1315.36] it's called upon, performing marriages, if anybody here is interested, and pronouncing
[1315.36 → 1317.74] God's blessings upon God's people.
[1320.66 → 1324.68] So, now, Nancy, can you turn me on here now?
[1325.28 → 1326.10] Oh, I am on there.
[1326.32 → 1326.44] Okay.
[1327.26 → 1328.36] In order...
[1330.20 → 1330.76] One.
[1332.36 → 1332.84] Two.
[1334.42 → 1339.58] In order that all of God's people assembled here may witness that you, in the strength of
[1339.58 → 1342.72] the Lord, accept the responsibilities of this office.
[1342.72 → 1346.98] You are requested to stand and answer the following questions.
[1347.38 → 1347.72] Sure.
[1351.76 → 1358.26] Do you believe that in the call of this congregation, God calls you to this holy ministry?
[1359.22 → 1359.98] Yes, I believe.
[1360.78 → 1366.90] Do you believe that the Old and New Testaments are the word of God, the only infallible rule
[1366.90 → 1368.20] of faith and life?
[1369.46 → 1370.42] Yes, I do.
[1370.42 → 1376.54] Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all teaching that
[1376.54 → 1377.38] contradicts them?
[1378.76 → 1379.52] Yes, I do.
[1379.70 → 1380.58] God helps me.
[1381.20 → 1386.30] And do you promise to be a faithful servant, to conduct yourself in a manner worthy of your
[1386.30 → 1389.96] calling, and to submit to the government and discipline of the church?
[1390.08 → 1391.06] Nancy, what is your answer?
[1391.78 → 1392.98] Yes, I do.
[1393.40 → 1394.30] God helps me.
[1394.30 → 1394.94] Okay.
[1396.14 → 1402.34] People of God, you have heard the commitment made by Nancy.
[1402.88 → 1409.68] I ask you now to stand in the presence of God and in the presence of one another to make
[1409.68 → 1410.64] these vows.
[1411.10 → 1414.86] Do you, in the name of the Lord, welcome Nancy as your commission pastor?
[1414.86 → 1422.00] Do you promise to pray for her, to encourage her, to join with her in the ministry that
[1422.00 → 1424.06] God has called all of us to?
[1424.52 → 1425.32] What is your answer?
[1426.14 → 1428.50] We do, God helping us.
[1428.68 → 1429.06] Thank you.
[1429.46 → 1430.06] You may be seated.
[1430.06 → 1431.06] Thank you.
[1431.06 → 1432.06] Thank you.
[1432.06 → 1433.06] Thank you.
[1433.06 → 1439.56] So this time we will lay hands on Nancy, and I want to invite all of our elders, if
[1439.56 → 1444.06] any of them are here, to come forward, to come on up.
[1444.06 → 1462.06] Thank you.
[1462.06 → 1463.62] Do you want to?
[1465.46 → 1466.16] Go ahead.
[1467.98 → 1468.40] You can.
[1469.04 → 1469.38] Yeah, sure.
[1469.86 → 1470.04] Okay.
[1470.52 → 1470.72] Okay.
[1470.72 → 1470.78] Okay.
[1474.06 → 1486.26] Nancy, may God, our Father, who has called you to this holy office, enlighten, strengthen,
[1487.26 → 1493.10] and govern you by his word, and equip you with his spirit, so that you may serve faithfully
[1493.10 → 1498.16] and fruitfully in your ministry, to the glory of God's name and the coming of the kingdom
[1498.16 → 1499.90] of his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1499.90 → 1504.14] In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[1504.96 → 1505.24] Amen.
[1505.24 → 1505.38] Amen.
[1514.80 → 1516.88] So Nancy, I will now give you this charge.
[1518.10 → 1520.18] Nancy, we rejoice with you today.
[1520.94 → 1525.44] May you experience much joy in fulfilling your calling.
[1525.44 → 1532.52] As you exercise the authority of the office entrusted to you, may you always remain a humble servant.
[1533.76 → 1540.84] Be faithful in prayer, diligent in your study of God's word, compassionate in your words,
[1541.64 → 1545.40] and an example as you comfort and sustain God's people.
[1546.08 → 1548.86] And use all of your gifts to the utmost of your ability.
[1548.86 → 1554.50] Above all, put on the love of our God and the compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1555.34 → 1559.14] And one day, our chief shepherd will give you the crown of glory, saying,
[1559.26 → 1561.18] Well done, good and faithful servant.
[1563.64 → 1567.62] And to the congregation, congratulations also.
[1568.52 → 1570.64] This truly is a day that the Lord has made.
[1570.74 → 1572.18] Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[1572.18 → 1577.54] Receive Nancy as one of God's leaders among you.
[1578.46 → 1580.46] Pray for her and encourage her.
[1581.28 → 1584.10] Respond to her work among you with love and respect.
[1584.88 → 1587.12] And share with her in the work of the ministry.
[1587.66 → 1592.20] If you do these things, you will receive the blessing of God on our ministry together.
[1593.44 → 1594.46] Let's pray together.
[1594.46 → 1599.82] Thank you, Lord, on this day for your many blessings.
[1600.62 → 1604.08] We rejoice that you have sent Nancy to labour and ministry among us.
[1604.86 → 1609.42] We love to tell the story of the day that Nancy came and knocked on the door.
[1610.52 → 1617.04] And she asked if she could use our church as a place to gather people for an evangelistic Bible study.
[1617.04 → 1625.00] And Lord, ever since you put that call and that burden on Nancy's heart to reach Chinese people in Delta and all around.
[1625.58 → 1630.42] Lord, we thank you for the way you have led us, bringing Nancy here to be our commission pastor.
[1631.04 → 1635.38] Lord, we pray that you would bless her as a servant of Christ in the church.
[1636.14 → 1640.34] Lord, would you strengthen Nancy and all of us in the work that you have called us to do.
[1640.44 → 1644.36] That we may be the salt of the earth and light of the world.
[1644.36 → 1652.74] Help us as congregation and pastor to endure the heat of the day and the darkness of the night.
[1653.40 → 1655.96] Sustained by your healing and guiding presence.
[1656.74 → 1662.08] Together, may we rejoice in the calling you have given us as we serve in your name.
[1662.64 → 1668.04] All of this we ask with thankful hearts in the name of your dear son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1668.76 → 1670.34] We pray. Amen.
[1672.20 → 1673.94] Let's give Nancy a round of applause.
[1674.36 → 1686.60] So as a song of celebration and response, we will sing Be Thou My Vision.
[1687.16 → 1688.94] Would you please rise and let's sing together.
[1688.94 → 1689.08] Amen.
[1689.08 → 1689.12] Amen.
[1704.36 → 1723.94] Be Thou My Vision.
[1723.94 → 1739.38] Thank you.
[1739.38 → 1743.36] I'm behind you.
[1743.94 → 1749.50] Let's sing Scripture.
[1749.50 → 1752.70] my life.
[1754.44 → 1756.80] Be thou my
[1756.80 → 1760.58] wisdom and thou my true
[1760.58 → 1764.76] word. I am here
[1764.76 → 1768.68] with thee and thou with me
[1768.68 → 1772.42] Lord. Thou my
[1772.42 → 1776.46] great Father, thine own may
[1776.46 → 1778.14] I be.
[1779.50 → 1782.50] Thou in me dwelling
[1782.50 → 1784.62] and I'm
[1784.62 → 1787.10] one with thee.
[1790.16 → 1792.22] Riches I
[1792.22 → 1794.22] heed not, nor
[1794.22 → 1797.60] men empty praise.
[1797.60 → 1799.70] Thou mine
[1799.70 → 1801.66] inheritance
[1801.66 → 1803.68] now and
[1803.68 → 1805.60] always.
[1805.60 → 1808.60] Thou and thou
[1808.60 → 1810.60] only first
[1811.22 → 1813.60] in my heart.
[1815.04 → 1815.60] I
[1815.60 → 1817.60] King of heaven,
[1817.60 → 1819.60] my treasure
[1820.32 → 1821.60] thou art.
[1824.60 → 1825.60] I
[1825.60 → 1828.60] King of heaven,
[1828.60 → 1830.60] my victory
[1830.60 → 1831.60] won.
[1831.60 → 1833.60] May I reach heaven to
[1833.60 → 1835.60] frighten the sun.
[1835.60 → 1838.60] Heart of my own heart, whatever we fall.
[1838.60 → 1845.60] Still be thy vision, O ruler of all.
[1845.60 → 1852.60] King of heaven, O ruler of all.
[1852.60 → 1858.60] Still be thy vision, O ruler of all.
[1858.60 → 1865.60] God of heaven, O ruler of all.
[1869.60 → 1870.60] You may be seated.
[1870.60 → 1871.60] Christ.
[1871.60 → 1872.60] Amen.
[1872.60 → 1873.60] Amen.
[1873.60 → 1874.60] Amen.
[1874.60 → 1875.60] Amen.
[1875.60 → 1876.60] Amen.
[1876.60 → 1877.60] Amen.
[1877.60 → 1878.60] Amen.
[1878.60 → 1879.60] Amen.
[1879.60 → 1880.60] Amen.
[1880.60 → 1883.70] We come before the Lord now in a prayer of confession.
[1883.70 → 1889.58] You know, as we just sang, thou and thou only first in my heart.
[1890.58 → 1892.12] That's what we were made for.
[1892.54 → 1895.04] That's what we seek and we desire.
[1895.42 → 1900.08] But the truth is that sometimes we don't put God first and only in our hearts.
[1900.44 → 1903.88] But actually, we look to other things.
[1905.12 → 1908.34] And because of that, we come before the Lord in this prayer of confession.
[1908.60 → 1912.54] I invite you to say it out loud together with me.
[1913.90 → 1918.32] Holy God, you have loved us with an unfailing mercy.
[1918.32 → 1920.64] But we have not loved you.
[1921.38 → 1925.54] Though you have called us to be steadfast in the faith,
[1926.28 → 1929.42] we remain enticed by our many sins,
[1930.18 → 1934.72] forgetting the freedom that you purchased for us at the cross.
[1935.78 → 1940.72] We remain slow in obedience, fickle in prayer,
[1941.50 → 1944.08] and consumed by our sinful desires.
[1944.08 → 1951.24] Our deeds and attitudes do not reflect the gospel that we claim to believe.
[1951.88 → 1959.88] Change us, O Lord, that we may desire purity, holiness, and righteousness instead.
[1960.64 → 1964.86] Help us to live as the people you have called us to be.
[1964.86 → 1968.46] It is in the name of Jesus that we pray.
[1969.14 → 1969.56] Amen.
[1972.40 → 1977.88] I want to give you a moment to come before the Lord in quietness and stillness.
[1978.12 → 1980.06] Come before him in the quietness of your heart.
[1980.92 → 1986.36] Confess your sins to him and also look to him for his mercy because he loves you.
[1986.36 → 2011.74] Father, we thank you this morning for your great compassion, your great mercy.
[2011.74 → 2016.14] Because, Lord Jesus, you have died for us in our place.
[2016.68 → 2019.46] And you have given us life where only we found death.
[2020.10 → 2026.02] You have given us righteousness only when we look in our hearts we find self-righteousness and sin.
[2027.18 → 2034.14] And, Lord, we thank you for that great gift by which you have called us to be your sons and daughters.
[2034.14 → 2040.68] We thank you for the mercy in which we stand and the love that you have for us always.
[2041.26 → 2042.48] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2042.88 → 2043.22] Amen.
[2044.20 → 2049.64] Brothers and sisters, if you confess your sins in Jesus' name and turn to him in faith,
[2049.76 → 2054.44] then these words of assurance are for you this morning.
[2054.66 → 2055.66] Would you please stand?
[2057.12 → 2061.02] And let's say these words of assurance together.
[2061.02 → 2064.24] Brothers and sisters, what can wash away our sins?
[2065.10 → 2067.10] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[2068.18 → 2070.68] We are brothers and sisters through his blood.
[2071.70 → 2073.12] We have died together.
[2073.60 → 2074.92] We will rise together.
[2075.54 → 2076.98] We will live together.
[2077.82 → 2082.58] You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[2083.26 → 2084.76] God's special possession,
[2084.76 → 2091.06] that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[2091.58 → 2095.56] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[2096.36 → 2101.18] Once you have not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[2101.94 → 2102.74] Thanks be to God.
[2103.16 → 2103.98] Let's sing together.
[2103.98 → 2133.96] Let's sing together.
[2133.98 → 2163.96] Let's sing together.
[2163.98 → 2165.18] Amazing love.
[2165.18 → 2173.46] How can it be that you, my King, would die for me?
[2175.46 → 2178.46] Amazing love.
[2178.52 → 2181.18] I know it's true.
[2182.86 → 2186.68] It's my joy to honour you.
[2186.68 → 2187.68] In all I do.
[2187.68 → 2188.68] Amazing love.
[2188.68 → 2190.68] Amazing love.
[2190.68 → 2191.78] Amazing love.
[2191.78 → 2200.16] How can it be that you, my King, would die for me?
[2200.16 → 2201.16] Amazing love.
[2201.16 → 2202.16] I know it's true.
[2202.16 → 2203.16] It's my joy to honour you.
[2203.16 → 2204.16] It's my joy to honour you.
[2204.16 → 2205.16] In all I do.
[2205.16 → 2206.16] I honour you.
[2206.16 → 2208.16] I honour you.
[2208.16 → 2209.16] You are my King.
[2209.16 → 2210.16] You are my King.
[2210.16 → 2213.16] Jesus, you are my King.
[2213.16 → 2214.16] You are my King.
[2214.16 → 2215.16] Jesus, you are my King.
[2215.16 → 2216.16] You are my King.
[2216.16 → 2220.16] You are my King.
[2220.16 → 2221.16] You are my King.
[2221.16 → 2225.16] You are my King.
[2225.16 → 2226.16] Jesus, you are my King.
[2226.16 → 2230.16] You are my King.
[2230.16 → 2231.16] You are my King.
[2231.16 → 2232.16] You are my King.
[2232.16 → 2237.16] You are my King.
[2237.16 → 2242.16] Jesus, you are my King.
[2242.16 → 2246.16] You are my King.
[2246.16 → 2269.16] You are my King.
[2269.16 → 2274.16] It's my joy to honour you.
[2274.16 → 2281.16] In all I do, I honour you.
[2281.16 → 2288.16] In all I do, I honour you.
[2299.16 → 2311.16] So we come now to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2311.16 → 2315.16] We're just saying how, Jesus, you are my king.
[2315.16 → 2321.16] And the way that Jesus can be our king is because he came,
[2321.16 → 2324.16] not as a conquering king, but as a humble king.
[2324.16 → 2332.16] He came and gave up his life and died on the cross so that we could be called his people
[2332.16 → 2337.16] and so that we could turn to him in hearts of faith and gratitude and trust
[2337.16 → 2344.16] and to look to him to be our king, to protect us, to guide us, to lead us in his way,
[2344.16 → 2348.16] and finally to lead us into our eternal home.
[2348.16 → 2352.16] So for that reason, this table is for Christians.
[2352.16 → 2360.16] It's for those who look to Jesus as their king, those who trust in him alone.
[2360.16 → 2367.16] So if you have been baptized, if you look to the Lord Jesus as your saviour and as your redeemer,
[2367.16 → 2373.16] then this table is for you and Jesus bids you to come and to feast with him.
[2373.16 → 2379.16] If you have not yet been baptized or if you have not yet fully trusted in Christ as your saviour,
[2379.16 → 2383.16] then we are glad that you are here.
[2383.16 → 2389.16] We ask that we welcome you to remain with us, but please do not take the elements.
[2389.16 → 2392.16] You can come forward and maybe just keep your hands closed.
[2392.16 → 2398.16] And maybe one of our elders would be glad to pray for you.
[2398.16 → 2404.16] So now hear these words of institution from the Apostle Paul.
[2404.16 → 2406.16] He said,
[2406.16 → 2424.16] In the same way also, he took the cup after supper saying,
[2424.16 → 2428.16] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[2428.16 → 2432.16] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[2432.16 → 2437.16] For as often as you eat this bread, and you drink this cup,
[2437.16 → 2442.16] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[2442.16 → 2450.16] So let us say these words of communion liturgy together.
[2450.16 → 2453.16] Brothers and sisters, lift your hearts.
[2453.16 → 2456.16] We are the God of the Lord.
[2456.16 → 2459.16] We are his people.
[2459.16 → 2462.16] We are redeemed by his grace.
[2462.16 → 2465.16] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[2465.16 → 2467.16] Christ has died.
[2467.16 → 2468.16] Christ has risen.
[2468.16 → 2470.16] Christ will die again.
[2470.16 → 2475.16] Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us.
[2475.16 → 2478.16] Therefore, let us keep the feast.
[2478.16 → 2482.16] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[2482.16 → 2484.16] Feed on him in your hearts by faith.
[2484.16 → 2489.16] Drink, remembering that Christ's blood was shed for you.
[2489.16 → 2493.16] So now let me give you a word of instruction.
[2493.16 → 2497.16] We are still coming forward to receive the elements.
[2497.16 → 2507.16] We think that in this way we can kind of mitigate against contamination and just trying to be a little bit of COVID cautious here.
[2507.16 → 2515.16] So what we will do is we will have an elder at the front of each aisle serving the bread and then the cup.
[2515.16 → 2521.16] And so our ushers will ask you starting in the back to come forward.
[2521.16 → 2525.16] And when you come forward, you can come together as households.
[2525.16 → 2527.16] Come and stand together.
[2527.16 → 2536.16] The elder will give each person in the household, whether it's, you know, a couple or kids or even if you're coming up singly,
[2536.16 → 2539.16] give you the bread, and then you take it there.
[2539.16 → 2540.16] Don't take it back to your seat.
[2540.16 → 2542.16] Go ahead and eat it there.
[2542.16 → 2546.16] And then you will go to the edges, and you'll take the cup and drink it there.
[2546.16 → 2550.16] And then you will go around to the outside aisles back to your seat.
[2550.16 → 2551.16] Okay.
[2551.16 → 2559.16] And also, while we partake of the Lord's Supper together in this way, we will also have some music we can sing along to.
[2559.16 → 2566.16] I also invite you to stay and just meditate and pray in your seats, reflect on what Christ has done for you on the cross.
[2566.16 → 2567.16] Okay.
[2567.16 → 2569.16] So let's celebrate together.
[2569.16 → 2573.16] Would the ushers, the servers, please come forward.
[2589.16 → 2590.16] Can we get the ball?
[2590.16 → 2591.16] I'll have a good one.
[2591.16 → 2592.16] I'll have a good one.
[2592.16 → 2593.16] Okay.
[2593.16 → 2594.16] How about the Lord?
[2594.16 → 2595.16] I'll have a good one.
[2595.16 → 2596.16] Okay.
[2596.16 → 2597.16] Okay.
[2597.16 → 2598.16] So let's prepare.
[2598.16 → 2599.16] You can do the other thing.
[2599.16 → 2600.16] All right.
[2600.16 → 2601.16] Okay.
[2601.16 → 2602.16] Bye.
[2602.16 → 2603.16] Bye.
[2603.16 → 2604.16] Bye.
[2604.16 → 2605.16] Bye.
[2605.16 → 2606.16] Bye.
[2606.16 → 2607.16] Bye.
[2607.16 → 2608.16] Bye.
[2608.16 → 2609.16] Bye.
[2609.16 → 2610.16] Bye.
[2610.16 → 2611.16] Bye.
[2611.16 → 2612.16] Bye.
[2612.16 → 2614.16] Bye.
[2614.16 → 2615.16] Bye.
[2615.16 → 2616.16] Bye.
[2616.16 → 2617.16] Bye.
[2617.16 → 2618.16] Bye.
[2618.16 → 2619.16] Bye.
[2619.16 → 2623.62] We want to mention that we have a verse serving for the benches.
[2625.08 → 2625.54] Oh, okay.
[2625.54 → 2625.60] Okay.
[2649.16 → 2651.16] Amen.
[2651.16 → 2652.16] Amen.
[2652.16 → 2653.16] Amen.
[2653.16 → 2654.16] Amen.
[2679.16 → 2681.16] Amen.
[2709.16 → 2711.16] Amen.
[2739.16 → 2741.16] Amen.
[2769.16 → 2770.16] Amen.
[2770.16 → 2771.16] Amen.
[2771.16 → 2773.16] Amen.
[2773.16 → 2774.16] Amen.
[2774.16 → 2776.16] Amen.
[2778.16 → 2779.16] Amen.
[2779.16 → 2781.16] Amen.
[2781.16 → 2783.16] Amen.
[2783.16 → 2784.16] Amen.
[2784.16 → 2787.16] Amen.
[2787.16 → 2789.16] Amen.
[2789.16 → 2805.18] no wisdom, but I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection.
[2805.18 → 2828.20] Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer, but this I know with all my heart,
[2828.20 → 2836.30] his wounds have made my love small.
[2858.20 → 2882.14] When I survey the wondrous cross,
[2882.14 → 2893.34] On which the Prince of glory died
[2893.34 → 2904.52] My riches they have found and lost
[2904.52 → 2916.52] And poor content of all my pride
[2916.52 → 2928.52] Lord, vivid Lord, that I should not
[2928.52 → 2939.52] Save in the death of Christ my God
[2939.52 → 2950.52] All the vain things that are joyous
[2950.52 → 2962.52] I sacrifice them to His blood
[2962.52 → 2974.52] Were thou realm of eternal life
[2974.52 → 2986.52] That were a present far too small
[2986.52 → 2996.52] Clouds so amazing, so divine
[2996.52 → 3010.52] Cements my soul, my life, my hope
[3010.52 → 3020.52] Am I?
[3020.52 → 3024.52] Am I?
[3024.52 → 3028.52] Am I?
[3028.52 → 3030.52] Am I?
[3030.52 → 3032.52] Am I?
[3032.52 → 3042.52] Am I?
[3042.52 → 3043.52] Am I?
[3043.52 → 3045.52] Am I?
[3045.52 → 3047.52] Am I?
[3047.52 → 3050.52] Am I?
[3051.52 → 3054.52] Am I?
[3054.52 → 3084.50] Thank you.
[3084.52 → 3114.50] Thank you.
[3114.52 → 3144.50] Thank you.
[3144.52 → 3174.50] Thank you.
[3174.52 → 3176.52] Thank you.
[3184.52 → 3185.84] Make sure this is on. There it is.
[3185.84 → 3190.78] Could I invite all the children to come up here?
[3191.32 → 3192.64] We'll have a little children's message.
[3192.64 → 3201.96] Go ahead.
[3201.96 → 3202.64] You guys sit up there.
[3202.64 → 3232.62] How are you all today?
[3232.62 → 3233.62] Hello.
[3233.62 → 3234.62] Hello.
[3234.62 → 3236.22] Come on up.
[3236.22 → 3244.34] So, excuse me.
[3244.34 → 3247.98] Do you guys ever forget things?
[3247.98 → 3251.42] I forget things all the time.
[3251.42 → 3256.36] When I was a kid, my mom would say, clean up your room.
[3257.46 → 3260.74] Then, later she would say, did you clean up your room?
[3260.78 → 3261.40] And what would I say?
[3262.24 → 3263.04] I forgot.
[3264.60 → 3265.64] No, I forgot.
[3265.90 → 3269.38] Or my mom would say, could you please take out the trash?
[3269.38 → 3270.38] And guess what?
[3270.38 → 3271.38] And guess what?
[3271.38 → 3272.66] What would I say?
[3272.66 → 3273.82] I forgot.
[3273.82 → 3274.76] I forgot.
[3274.76 → 3276.22] Exactly.
[3276.22 → 3276.26] Exactly.
[3276.26 → 3278.98] So, do you know what's...
[3278.98 → 3280.12] Do you know what I have on my finger here?
[3280.12 → 3282.96] It's a red thread.
[3282.96 → 3284.80] It's a red thread.
[3285.60 → 3292.32] And so, I've never done this, but a long time ago, people used to tie a red thread on their
[3292.32 → 3294.60] finger to help them remember.
[3294.60 → 3299.44] So, if they saw this thing on their finger, they'd be like, okay, I put that there.
[3299.80 → 3301.20] What am I forgetting?
[3301.42 → 3302.08] Oh, yeah.
[3303.00 → 3304.10] I need to take out the trash.
[3304.60 → 3304.80] Right?
[3304.86 → 3305.52] So, they would do that.
[3305.60 → 3308.46] So, they'd be like, oh, they see it, and they remember there's something there.
[3308.72 → 3311.38] Because we all have such a hard time remembering things.
[3312.64 → 3312.90] Yeah.
[3312.90 → 3322.90] So, now, when Jesus was on the last night before he went to die on the cross, he wanted us to
[3322.90 → 3323.92] remember something.
[3324.50 → 3327.40] But he knows that we have such a hard time remembering.
[3328.02 → 3329.28] He didn't want us to forget.
[3330.20 → 3334.74] So, he gave us this meal that we all just took together.
[3334.86 → 3335.98] He gave us the Lord's Supper.
[3336.62 → 3342.88] And he gave us the bread, and he broke it, and he said, this is like my body.
[3343.04 → 3343.98] I'm going to die for you.
[3344.64 → 3348.38] This broken bread is like, I'm going to heal the world.
[3348.76 → 3350.14] The world won't be broken anymore.
[3351.16 → 3355.64] And then he poured the wine, and he gave it to all of his friends, and he said, just like
[3355.64 → 3363.24] this wine, this is like my blood, which is poured out for you so that your heart can be
[3363.24 → 3363.78] healed again.
[3364.20 → 3371.66] And he said, I want you to celebrate this meal all the time so that you will remember me.
[3371.66 → 3371.80] Okay.
[3372.80 → 3381.34] So, when we celebrate the Lord's Supper, when we eat, and we drink the cup, Jesus said it's so that
[3381.34 → 3382.36] we can remember him.
[3382.66 → 3383.94] So, it's kind of like this ribbon.
[3385.08 → 3385.24] Okay.
[3385.30 → 3386.00] And so, that's why we do it.
[3386.04 → 3386.52] Every week.
[3386.54 → 3390.82] So, every week, we can remember Jesus died for us because he loves us.
[3391.18 → 3391.40] Okay.
[3391.40 → 3392.18] Can you remember that?
[3393.76 → 3394.16] Okay.
[3394.26 → 3394.56] Thanks.
[3394.56 → 3395.36] Let's pray.
[3396.36 → 3399.70] Father, would you bless these children.
[3400.46 → 3404.82] Lord, help us never to forget what you have done for us on the cross.
[3405.54 → 3411.16] Help us to remember every day and every time that we celebrate together.
[3411.84 → 3413.28] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3413.92 → 3414.14] Amen.
[3414.14 → 3421.28] Peace out.
[3427.82 → 3428.26] Okay.
[3428.38 → 3428.76] Who's going to lead them?
[3430.34 → 3430.60] Okay.
[3430.70 → 3431.20] Go with Hannah.
[3434.70 → 3435.08] Break.
[3435.08 → 3437.22] Thank you.
[3437.22 → 3441.56] Thank you.
[3441.64 → 3442.48] Thank you.
[3442.48 → 3443.06] Thank you.
[3443.28 → 3443.56] Thank you.
[3443.56 → 3473.54] Thank you.
[3473.56 → 3503.54] Thank you.
[3503.56 → 3513.18] And we've been considering together God's good design and God's good intentions for marriage, for singleness, for sexuality.
[3513.18 → 3521.38] And these have been some challenging topics to look at and discuss together.
[3521.38 → 3524.54] I feel they have been challenging.
[3524.80 → 3528.30] I don't know if you've also thought they were challenging.
[3528.70 → 3536.30] On the one hand, they're challenging because when it comes to views and beliefs around the issues of sexual identity and sexual ethics,
[3537.10 → 3544.16] Christians are often seen as strange and kind of weird and out of step with our culture.
[3544.96 → 3553.22] And so as Christians, we face the challenge of being faithful to God's word in the midst of a culture that believes and lives very differently.
[3553.36 → 3554.22] That's a challenge.
[3554.22 → 3567.00] But for me, and I think maybe for others of us here, that's not the main reason why it's a challenge to talk about these things.
[3567.00 → 3573.46] I think the real challenge is that we wrestle with these issues ourselves.
[3574.64 → 3578.24] They're challenging for us to live them out.
[3578.56 → 3579.48] Marriage is hard.
[3580.46 → 3582.06] Singleness is hard.
[3582.06 → 3590.26] And all of us have sinned sexually in all sorts of ways, you know, or we have been sinned against.
[3591.06 → 3599.12] And so we carry a deep sense of shame and brokenness in us because, especially because of sexual sin.
[3600.50 → 3605.72] And so while we definitely need clarity from God's word to help us think rightly about these things,
[3605.78 → 3610.66] and so we've gone to the Bible, we want to know what God has to say, we need clarity.
[3610.66 → 3614.30] But friends, we also need compassion, right?
[3614.34 → 3623.28] We need to know not only God's will for how he wants us to live, but we also need to know his heart for the sexually broken.
[3624.24 → 3633.66] And I can't think of a better passage to turn to than this beautiful story of the woman, of Jesus with a woman caught in adultery.
[3634.14 → 3635.60] So let's prepare.
[3635.72 → 3637.16] I think Haley, you're going to read it for us?
[3637.16 → 3641.08] Okay, so invite Haley up and she will read this passage.
[3641.22 → 3643.78] Let's prepare to hear God's word.
[3643.78 → 3663.28] John chapter 8, verse 1 to 11.
[3663.28 → 3668.78] Earlier today, I know you may be on the line.
[3669.00 → 3676.56] At dawn he appeared again at the temple courts where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
[3677.06 → 3681.74] The teacher of laws and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
[3682.90 → 3686.16] They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus,
[3686.16 → 3690.16] Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
[3691.14 → 3694.14] In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such woman.
[3694.90 → 3695.96] What do you say?
[3696.82 → 3703.36] They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[3704.36 → 3707.96] But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with his finger.
[3709.08 → 3712.78] When they kept questioning him, he strained up and said to them,
[3712.78 → 3717.94] Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.
[3719.06 → 3721.96] Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
[3723.84 → 3729.56] And at this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first,
[3730.76 → 3734.38] until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[3735.24 → 3737.04] Jesus strained up and asked her,
[3737.92 → 3741.48] Woman, where are they? Has no one commended you?
[3741.48 → 3744.46] No one, sir, she said.
[3745.14 → 3748.06] Then neither do I commend you, Jesus declared.
[3748.38 → 3750.48] Now go and leave your life of sin.
[3759.38 → 3761.36] Thank you, Haley. Great job.
[3761.36 → 3765.88] So let's pray as we come before the Lord together.
[3766.82 → 3773.46] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this beautiful picture of your great love and your compassion for the sexually broken.
[3774.96 → 3781.72] And Lord, each one of us has sinned in different ways.
[3782.92 → 3785.52] Lord, in often ways that we don't want to share with others.
[3785.52 → 3787.36] But Lord, you know our hearts.
[3788.02 → 3793.88] And we pray that even as we now come before your word, that you would comfort us.
[3794.20 → 3800.78] That you would help us to experience and to know your deep love and your deep compassion for us.
[3801.46 → 3803.12] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3804.00 → 3804.32] Amen.
[3804.32 → 3811.04] Now before we need to, before we kind of look into this passage, there is something we need to deal with.
[3811.92 → 3819.78] And that is, some of you, if you've read this passage in your own Bibles, you may notice that perhaps it is set off in italics,
[3819.80 → 3825.18] or there's like a, you know, a divider, something like that, or something at the top that says,
[3825.52 → 3830.20] something along the lines of, this passage is not in the earliest manuscripts.
[3830.20 → 3839.80] So, many biblical scholars agree that this probably wasn't originally in the Gospel of John.
[3841.24 → 3845.36] Now, some pastors, because of this, they will skip over this passage and say,
[3845.50 → 3847.84] this isn't scripture, I'm not going to preach on it.
[3848.94 → 3857.22] But some other scholars also say that this is very likely an authentic story of the Lord Jesus.
[3857.22 → 3865.84] The story does appear in some early manuscripts, and the church throughout history has regarded it as a part of the canon of scripture,
[3866.16 → 3869.66] which is why it's still in our Bibles, but then they just set it off a bit.
[3870.08 → 3871.06] So it's both.
[3871.82 → 3872.66] It's not original.
[3873.06 → 3875.08] Actually, in some manuscripts, it appears in Luke.
[3875.18 → 3875.64] It's kind of weird.
[3876.58 → 3880.18] They can tell by the grammar, the style, that's probably not John.
[3880.18 → 3886.98] But I believe, and the church believes, that God not only works through the original writers,
[3887.12 → 3890.62] but he also is at work through the process of canonization,
[3890.84 → 3895.12] by which we now collect these scriptures that have come down to us through the ages.
[3895.76 → 3902.82] So I believe that, according to the earliest church, they've looked to this as a true story of Jesus,
[3902.82 → 3906.00] and that's why they maybe stuck it in there.
[3906.92 → 3910.78] And then we also believe that, therefore, we can say of this passage,
[3910.92 → 3912.38] this is the word of the Lord.
[3913.12 → 3915.28] That's what I believe, and if you have any questions about that,
[3915.32 → 3917.74] and you want to kind of talk to me about that later, feel free.
[3918.64 → 3921.04] So I do think this passage has a lot to teach us.
[3921.34 → 3928.88] It's a story that powerfully displays both the grace and the truth of the Lord Jesus,
[3928.88 → 3931.08] and it has a lot that can benefit us.
[3932.84 → 3936.20] And so, here's our question for this morning.
[3937.12 → 3943.62] If someone experiences feelings of brokenness or shame or condemnation in their sexuality,
[3943.98 → 3946.96] as many of us do, how can we be healed?
[3947.54 → 3949.88] How can we be set free?
[3950.52 → 3954.94] How can we experience the forgiveness of God that he has for us?
[3955.68 → 3958.18] How can we be restored in ourselves?
[3959.02 → 3963.42] And I think this passage helps us, and it answers this question, I think, in two ways.
[3963.96 → 3968.82] The first is this, and it begins with recognizing our condemnation.
[3969.44 → 3973.38] That is to say, recognizing this, that God has made us as human beings.
[3973.38 → 3976.66] He made us as sexual creatures.
[3976.86 → 3978.00] He made our sexuality.
[3978.22 → 3978.84] It is good.
[3979.26 → 3982.96] But what we did is that we took this good gift of God,
[3983.10 → 3985.90] and we put it in the place of God.
[3985.90 → 3988.82] We try to make it ultimate in our lives.
[3989.40 → 3996.54] So instead of looking to God for our life and for our joy and for a sense of intimacy and identity,
[3997.12 → 4002.62] instead we turn to our sexuality and sexual experience to give us those things.
[4003.50 → 4008.18] We look to God's gift of sexuality, and we put it in the place of God in our lives.
[4008.18 → 4015.22] And, friends, the result is that we are left unsatisfied and unfulfilled,
[4016.18 → 4020.02] and it ends up that we use our sexuality in all kinds of destructive ways.
[4020.02 → 4024.96] You know, it's been getting colder at night, and I've, you know, at night, Christy says,
[4025.04 → 4026.90] put on a sweatshirt if you're complaining about being cold.
[4028.06 → 4028.42] Yes.
[4028.90 → 4032.72] But also what we love to do is to turn on the fireplace, right?
[4033.72 → 4035.92] I love saying that, turn on the fireplace.
[4037.20 → 4039.68] You know, I grew up hauling in the logs.
[4039.84 → 4042.40] You know, this is more fun, but there's technology.
[4042.80 → 4045.10] But we can turn on the fireplace, and it has the same effect.
[4045.10 → 4047.16] It's fireplace is warm.
[4047.34 → 4048.58] It's life-giving.
[4048.92 → 4049.72] It's beautiful.
[4050.98 → 4054.00] But what happens when the fire is outside the fireplace?
[4055.34 → 4057.24] It can burn your house down, can't it?
[4057.58 → 4057.76] Right?
[4057.80 → 4061.28] It can be incredibly destructive and dangerous.
[4062.40 → 4064.78] And sex works a lot like fire.
[4065.58 → 4068.92] On the one hand, God gave us sex to enjoy and experience in this,
[4069.22 → 4073.88] the fireplace of the covenant of marriage between one man and one woman for life.
[4073.88 → 4080.00] And in that context, it can be delightful and good.
[4080.72 → 4086.54] But when it gets outside that context, it can burn and leave permanent scars and destroy.
[4087.52 → 4090.22] So many people have experienced that.
[4091.20 → 4092.86] Proverbs 14, 12 says,
[4093.44 → 4095.78] There is a way that appears to be right.
[4097.06 → 4097.96] It's up there.
[4098.72 → 4099.20] It will be.
[4099.72 → 4100.18] There it is.
[4100.18 → 4105.56] There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end, it leads to death.
[4107.64 → 4111.48] And friends, that means that if we're going to be healed and restored,
[4111.62 → 4114.08] we need to recognize our own sexual brokenness,
[4114.32 → 4119.52] and we need to recognize our own misdirected desires as human beings.
[4120.20 → 4121.86] And that's what we see in this passage.
[4121.86 → 4125.56] And now to understand this, we need to look at the story,
[4125.74 → 4129.18] and we need to remember the context, and we need to remember what's going on.
[4130.26 → 4132.04] So let's use our imaginations.
[4132.28 → 4133.92] Jesus is in Jerusalem,
[4134.70 → 4138.70] and he is there to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
[4139.94 → 4144.00] And right before this, in chapter 7, there have been all kinds of arguments.
[4144.32 → 4145.48] There have been disputes.
[4145.48 → 4149.32] There are the crowds who are starting to believe,
[4149.48 → 4151.66] well, Jesus, maybe he's really the Messiah,
[4151.78 → 4154.48] the one we have been waiting for and longing for so long.
[4154.86 → 4156.64] Look at how gentle he is.
[4156.70 → 4157.76] Look at his teachings.
[4158.42 → 4160.52] Look at the miracles and healings he has done.
[4161.72 → 4163.64] Some people still doubt and say,
[4163.78 → 4166.04] well, can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[4166.92 → 4171.20] And then you have the Pharisees who do not believe that Jesus is the Messiah,
[4171.66 → 4174.26] and that actually they are trying to find ways to condemn him.
[4174.26 → 4176.14] So that's the setting.
[4176.32 → 4179.12] Now, chapter 8, it begins.
[4179.40 → 4180.58] It's early in the morning.
[4180.96 → 4185.02] The sun is just coming up and breaking over the hills of Jerusalem,
[4185.20 → 4187.06] casting its golden glow.
[4187.46 → 4191.82] All is quiet, but already there are people gathered in the temple courts,
[4191.94 → 4194.32] and they are just waiting for Jesus to show up.
[4194.38 → 4196.24] They know that that's where he usually goes.
[4197.00 → 4198.88] So Jesus was on the Mount of Olives.
[4198.98 → 4200.22] He was praying to his Father.
[4201.02 → 4204.02] Early in the morning, he walks in to the temple.
[4204.26 → 4206.32] Because he knows the people are going to be there.
[4206.82 → 4210.64] And he sits down, and he teaches them.
[4211.28 → 4212.72] He teaches them about God.
[4213.10 → 4215.14] He teaches them about the kingdom of God.
[4216.68 → 4218.10] So you can imagine that scene.
[4218.22 → 4218.76] It's quiet.
[4218.98 → 4220.62] People are just drawn to Jesus.
[4220.62 → 4222.76] They're listening attentively to him.
[4222.76 → 4227.88] And then all of a sudden, we can maybe imagine what happens next.
[4228.24 → 4230.36] There's a commotion, and a woman shouts,
[4230.70 → 4231.56] Let go of me!
[4232.72 → 4235.62] A group of men is dragging this woman,
[4236.18 → 4239.42] and hauls her right in to the middle of this group
[4239.42 → 4241.26] who are gathered around Jesus.
[4241.26 → 4246.60] And just like that, it's now a court-like setting.
[4247.98 → 4251.60] They set Jesus up to act as a judge in the situation,
[4252.36 → 4257.40] asking him to condemn this woman caught being unfaithful in her marriage vows.
[4259.64 → 4262.60] Condemnation hangs heavy in the air.
[4262.60 → 4265.88] Everyone can feel the judgment.
[4267.28 → 4269.22] And when we read this story carefully,
[4269.34 → 4271.94] I think we see three layers of judgment going on.
[4272.34 → 4274.92] The first layer, of course, is the case of the woman.
[4275.70 → 4279.00] Absolutely no one denies her guilt.
[4280.66 → 4283.42] But there's a question that immediately becomes apparent.
[4284.36 → 4285.30] Where's the guy?
[4285.30 → 4288.78] Something very, very fishy is going on,
[4288.84 → 4292.06] because, well, it takes two people to commit adultery.
[4293.04 → 4294.30] And in the law of Moses,
[4294.62 → 4297.72] both the man and the woman were to be punished for their adultery.
[4298.04 → 4299.90] That's what it says in Exodus and Deuteronomy.
[4300.62 → 4302.22] This is totally unjust.
[4303.02 → 4305.14] They are using this woman, right?
[4305.20 → 4308.46] And that tells us the Pharisees, they don't care about righteousness.
[4309.18 → 4311.46] They don't really care about the law of Moses.
[4311.46 → 4315.22] They were just using her to test Jesus.
[4316.02 → 4319.54] So here, Jesus is confronted only with the woman.
[4320.90 → 4323.72] Jesus, do you condemn this guilty woman as guilty?
[4325.72 → 4329.56] And if we know Jesus which we do from the Gospels,
[4329.82 → 4333.70] we can just imagine how furious he is about this situation.
[4335.34 → 4338.48] But there's a second layer of judgment that John tells us about.
[4339.30 → 4340.86] Jesus himself is on trial.
[4341.52 → 4344.38] They are hoping to condemn Jesus.
[4345.30 → 4346.46] Will he let her off?
[4347.10 → 4349.64] Because he is famous for his mercy.
[4350.92 → 4355.06] People are drawn to him for his gentleness and his compassion.
[4355.92 → 4357.20] If he does let her off,
[4357.34 → 4360.20] then they can condemn him for not following the law of Moses.
[4360.20 → 4365.76] But if he does condemn her, if he says, yes, stone her,
[4366.16 → 4369.08] then everyone will think, well, he's not merciful.
[4369.88 → 4373.82] Not only that, he could get in trouble with the Romans who occupied the land
[4373.82 → 4377.50] because the Romans kept capital punishment for themselves.
[4377.50 → 4384.60] So getting Jesus arrested for political insurrection would be a good way to get rid of him also.
[4385.36 → 4386.58] It's a perfect trap.
[4387.20 → 4389.68] No matter what Jesus says, they can condemn him,
[4389.76 → 4393.62] either in the opinion of the crowds or with the Romans.
[4393.62 → 4398.72] But there's a third layer of judgment that we need to talk about.
[4399.36 → 4401.40] The third layer is the courtroom of Jesus.
[4402.24 → 4407.78] And everyone standing there, the woman, the teachers of the law, the Pharisees,
[4407.92 → 4411.68] and all the crowd who are gathered, they are all on trial.
[4411.68 → 4416.36] And I think we see this in a subtle way in this passage.
[4416.64 → 4419.82] So in verse 6, see what it says.
[4420.70 → 4425.86] They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[4427.06 → 4432.90] But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
[4434.40 → 4440.14] Now, the question that we've all had since we were, you know, heard this story in Sunday school,
[4440.14 → 4443.50] why was Jesus writing on the ground?
[4443.64 → 4446.44] And for what on earth could he have been writing?
[4446.72 → 4448.82] There are all kinds of speculation about this.
[4449.34 → 4453.00] Some people say, well, maybe he was just trying to think of something to say, right?
[4453.02 → 4454.18] This is a hard question.
[4454.88 → 4456.30] He just needs a minute to think.
[4456.46 → 4457.64] He's kind of stalling for time.
[4459.32 → 4463.80] Some people say he was trying to get the attention off the woman, right?
[4463.80 → 4467.48] So he was doing something kind of interesting and mysterious,
[4467.80 → 4469.72] and everyone's kind of looking, what's going on?
[4470.14 → 4473.04] Drawing their attention away from the woman to him.
[4474.14 → 4475.40] We don't know for sure.
[4476.14 → 4481.04] But I think the best way that we can understand this is to look at the other places of the Bible
[4481.04 → 4488.24] where it talks about a finger writing in the Bible.
[4488.24 → 4495.86] And there are a couple places, but the most important place with this writing of a finger
[4495.86 → 4501.14] is the finger of God wrote the Ten Commandments onto the tablet of stone.
[4501.60 → 4504.14] So listen to this from Exodus 31.
[4504.14 → 4507.88] When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai,
[4507.88 → 4511.42] he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law,
[4512.10 → 4517.24] the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
[4517.24 → 4523.90] So I think what is happening here is that the teachers of the law and the Pharisees,
[4524.00 → 4527.00] they're quoting the law of Moses to Jesus.
[4527.76 → 4530.26] And Jesus is writing on the ground thinking,
[4530.26 → 4533.10] I wrote that law, right?
[4533.18 → 4536.30] I am the God of the Old Testament.
[4538.24 → 4540.34] Maybe he was writing the Ten Commandments.
[4540.44 → 4542.20] Maybe he was writing, thou shalt not commit adultery.
[4542.28 → 4542.80] We don't know.
[4542.80 → 4550.64] But it's a definite pointer to this reality that it is God who gives the law
[4550.64 → 4553.78] and it is Jesus, the finger of God, who wrote the law.
[4554.22 → 4557.70] See, the law was given to the people of Israel for the good of all humanity.
[4558.44 → 4561.14] That first Israel, then through Israel, the whole world,
[4561.42 → 4563.44] would know God's will for his people
[4563.44 → 4566.74] and that we would actually know what is right and good.
[4566.74 → 4574.62] But the law was given also to reveal our unrighteousness, right?
[4574.74 → 4578.50] Every single Israelite was a breaker of God's law.
[4579.46 → 4583.48] And in the New Testament, we're even taught that even if you keep most of the law,
[4584.14 → 4588.20] but not all of it, we too are lawbreakers.
[4588.70 → 4592.66] We will never be innocent before God because we don't keep the law perfectly
[4592.66 → 4595.84] and we will be found guilty under the law.
[4596.74 → 4597.88] So what happens next?
[4597.92 → 4598.80] What does Jesus do?
[4599.82 → 4600.82] It's brilliant, right?
[4601.20 → 4602.92] The way Jesus gets out of this trap.
[4603.40 → 4604.30] Look at verse 7.
[4605.12 → 4605.86] It says,
[4607.20 → 4610.22] When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,
[4611.02 → 4615.08] Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.
[4616.02 → 4616.82] Then verse 9,
[4616.82 → 4621.56] At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time,
[4622.06 → 4623.16] the older ones first,
[4623.16 → 4628.36] until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[4630.12 → 4631.42] Why did they all leave?
[4633.72 → 4637.38] They left because no one was without sin.
[4638.42 → 4638.56] Right?
[4638.68 → 4642.92] Jesus turns the spotlight off the woman, off of himself,
[4643.00 → 4645.06] and he shines it on every single person there,
[4645.06 → 4649.00] and no one could stand without condemnation.
[4649.70 → 4655.22] No one could stand under the law and say they have not sinned.
[4657.34 → 4663.84] You know, our culture is going through a massive experiment right now.
[4664.60 → 4667.52] We, we, the message is, and we are constantly telling ourselves,
[4667.64 → 4669.28] we're telling one another, we're telling our children,
[4669.28 → 4674.66] the one law that you should live by is follow your heart no matter what.
[4675.72 → 4675.88] Right?
[4675.96 → 4677.10] Follow your heart no matter what.
[4677.40 → 4678.32] Follow your desires.
[4678.68 → 4679.60] Follow your passions.
[4680.28 → 4683.68] Don't let anyone tell you to go against your desires.
[4684.96 → 4691.40] Now that belief goes against the collective wisdom of humanity throughout the ages.
[4691.50 → 4691.62] Right?
[4691.66 → 4694.98] Not just Christian history, but like all cultures have said,
[4694.98 → 4697.82] no, you need to control your desires.
[4698.24 → 4704.24] You need to control your passions because your passions will lead you into all kinds of hurt and trouble,
[4704.50 → 4706.30] and you shouldn't trust them.
[4707.48 → 4713.16] And unfortunately, when we live by this follow your desires wherever they go doctrine,
[4713.82 → 4718.62] the results are often shame and regret and heartache and depression.
[4718.62 → 4728.66] And feelings of condemnation come both from the things we do and from the things that are done to us.
[4728.94 → 4730.20] And that is certainly true of the woman.
[4730.30 → 4731.12] I mean, she was guilty.
[4731.52 → 4732.56] She committed adultery.
[4733.00 → 4733.92] She's not denying it.
[4733.98 → 4734.56] No one is.
[4735.08 → 4736.22] But also, she was used.
[4736.28 → 4740.94] She was being used by these Pharisees in order to prove a point.
[4741.02 → 4742.08] They don't care about justice.
[4742.26 → 4743.34] They're just trying to use her.
[4743.34 → 4749.16] And so when it comes to sexual sin, in the same way, we sin, we are sinned against.
[4752.22 → 4759.12] And as a result, some of us feel the condemnation like we see in this passage.
[4759.38 → 4761.54] Some of us feel condemned by other people.
[4762.86 → 4767.44] Some of us this morning condemn ourselves for the things we have done.
[4767.44 → 4777.30] And for a lot of us, even as Christians, when we think of God, instead of feeling forgiven and free,
[4777.68 → 4780.56] we still feel condemned.
[4781.30 → 4784.62] We think of God maybe as the chief condemner.
[4785.48 → 4788.14] We think that God's disappointed with us too.
[4788.14 → 4797.00] So what John is doing here is he's very intentionally evoking this theme of condemnation.
[4797.70 → 4802.42] It's like, you know, sometimes you watch the, you know, you see these movies and everyone's got their guns drawn.
[4802.64 → 4804.70] And everyone's pointing to everyone else.
[4806.80 → 4808.98] And no one wants to be the first one to lower their weapon.
[4809.78 → 4811.12] That's what's going on in this picture.
[4811.32 → 4814.90] Everyone is being judged and judging.
[4814.90 → 4820.28] And John is saying, if you want to be healed of your sexual brokenness,
[4820.50 → 4822.80] if you want your shame to be removed,
[4823.30 → 4826.34] you have to recognize that you need to be forgiven.
[4827.32 → 4830.12] You need to recognize your condemnation.
[4831.02 → 4834.02] And friends, if this story stopped right here,
[4834.90 → 4836.72] what would, what would it be like?
[4837.12 → 4841.52] It would be that Jesus alone is standing there
[4841.52 → 4845.30] as the true lawgiver.
[4845.74 → 4848.76] The only one who kept the law of God perfectly.
[4848.90 → 4851.44] The only one who has the right to judge.
[4851.54 → 4852.70] And all of us would be gone.
[4853.08 → 4854.36] Jesus would be the righteous judge.
[4854.48 → 4855.06] And that would be it.
[4856.82 → 4859.06] And if that's where we are left with,
[4859.12 → 4860.62] then we are truly in trouble.
[4862.32 → 4863.54] But thanks be to God,
[4863.62 → 4867.08] there is a second part of what it means to be healed of our sexual brokenness.
[4867.08 → 4869.02] It's not just to recognize our condemnation,
[4869.24 → 4872.12] but it's to receive Jesus' compassion.
[4872.68 → 4874.36] And friends, that's the whole point of this passage.
[4874.54 → 4877.06] We see the compassion of the Lord Jesus.
[4878.68 → 4880.40] And so let's consider for a moment,
[4880.56 → 4883.38] what is the kind of compassion that Jesus brings?
[4884.04 → 4886.42] And I want us to think about this passage together.
[4887.12 → 4890.92] First, I want you to see the grace of the compassion.
[4891.32 → 4892.86] The grace of Jesus' compassion.
[4892.86 → 4895.64] And you couldn't have a more beautiful picture
[4895.64 → 4901.04] than of how Jesus silences the shame of this woman's accusers.
[4901.82 → 4902.30] Right?
[4902.38 → 4903.64] They all walk away.
[4904.42 → 4905.52] They all disappear.
[4905.92 → 4909.18] He clears away all of those who are shaming her.
[4910.26 → 4912.96] And then she is left standing alone.
[4915.04 → 4917.00] Now, imagine you're that woman.
[4918.58 → 4919.86] Everyone else is gone now.
[4920.64 → 4922.00] You have Jesus standing there.
[4922.00 → 4923.90] And remember what Jesus said,
[4924.30 → 4926.66] let any one of you who is without sin
[4926.66 → 4928.68] be the first to throw a stone at her.
[4929.94 → 4932.24] Imagine what she must have been thinking.
[4932.72 → 4934.50] I mean, I would think this would be a little bit scary.
[4935.22 → 4937.20] He doesn't say, don't stone her.
[4938.30 → 4941.02] And now the one who is without sin,
[4941.90 → 4946.70] the one who does have the right to throw the first stone,
[4946.70 → 4948.58] the one who wrote the law,
[4949.06 → 4951.14] is the only one standing there.
[4952.00 → 4954.34] He could condemn her.
[4954.94 → 4959.76] But he is also the only one there with the authority to forgive sin.
[4960.86 → 4964.94] And so he says these precious words in these verses.
[4964.94 → 4968.24] Jesus asked, verse 10,
[4968.24 → 4970.36] woman, where are they?
[4970.76 → 4971.94] Has no one condemned you?
[4972.60 → 4973.92] No one, sir, she said.
[4974.44 → 4976.68] Then neither do I condemn you.
[4977.58 → 4977.72] Right?
[4977.88 → 4979.70] The Lord of heaven and earth,
[4979.88 → 4981.48] the God who gave the law,
[4981.60 → 4983.50] says, neither do I condemn you.
[4983.50 → 4986.10] And the reason he is able to look at her
[4986.10 → 4988.24] and to look at you and me and say,
[4988.36 → 4989.60] neither do I condemn you,
[4989.66 → 4990.90] is because on the cross,
[4991.30 → 4993.50] Jesus was condemned for us.
[4994.40 → 4994.62] Right?
[4994.68 → 4995.24] On the cross,
[4995.38 → 4997.08] Jesus was not only the judge,
[4997.12 → 4998.64] but he became the accused.
[4999.80 → 5001.44] Jesus received the judgment
[5001.44 → 5002.92] of the law of Moses
[5002.92 → 5004.26] in our place.
[5004.60 → 5006.86] All of us are guilty of breaking the law,
[5006.86 → 5009.42] but instead of us being stoned,
[5009.78 → 5010.64] he was stoned.
[5011.08 → 5013.42] He took the punishment for our sin
[5013.42 → 5015.14] so that we could be set free.
[5016.46 → 5016.96] And friends,
[5017.02 → 5018.30] it doesn't matter who you are,
[5018.38 → 5020.40] it doesn't matter how you have sinned,
[5020.82 → 5023.78] there are no words that will wash away shame
[5023.78 → 5026.48] and set you free and restore you
[5026.48 → 5028.58] like hearing those words from Jesus
[5028.58 → 5031.00] that he does not condemn you.
[5031.68 → 5032.64] But instead,
[5032.82 → 5033.82] he embraces you
[5033.82 → 5035.02] and he forgives you.
[5035.02 → 5037.84] And if you want to hear those words,
[5038.04 → 5040.30] like if you want to know those words,
[5040.40 → 5041.48] that I do not condemn you
[5041.48 → 5043.08] and know them deep in your heart
[5043.08 → 5044.28] and deep in your soul,
[5044.36 → 5045.36] there is only one way.
[5046.14 → 5048.20] And this story tells us the way.
[5048.76 → 5049.92] Again, it's subtle,
[5050.34 → 5052.68] but after all the accusers are cleared away,
[5052.86 → 5054.20] notice, where is the woman?
[5056.28 → 5058.46] She is with Jesus.
[5059.18 → 5059.94] Did you notice that?
[5060.42 → 5061.76] She's right there with him.
[5061.76 → 5063.46] She was wise enough
[5063.46 → 5064.88] to stay with Jesus
[5064.88 → 5066.48] until everyone else has left.
[5067.14 → 5068.26] What would I have done?
[5068.32 → 5070.78] I probably would have like slinked away.
[5071.58 → 5072.82] Like time to get out of here.
[5073.08 → 5074.16] I see my escape route.
[5075.26 → 5076.84] But no, she stays.
[5077.54 → 5078.88] She turns to Jesus.
[5079.82 → 5081.98] And it means that she is going to live
[5081.98 → 5083.24] by his voice.
[5084.02 → 5086.82] She is going to live by his verdict.
[5087.48 → 5089.40] Not the voice of her own shame
[5089.40 → 5090.36] and regret.
[5090.36 → 5092.32] Not the spite of her neighbours
[5092.32 → 5093.46] and their condemnation.
[5093.84 → 5095.24] Not even the law of Moses.
[5095.62 → 5098.20] But she has decided only to listen
[5098.20 → 5099.92] to the voice of Jesus.
[5100.90 → 5101.36] And friends,
[5101.44 → 5103.40] this is the way to be free of condemnation.
[5104.26 → 5106.26] We go to the real courtroom.
[5106.62 → 5108.16] We go to the real judge
[5108.16 → 5110.74] and we await his judgment over us.
[5111.22 → 5112.84] And we know that this judge,
[5113.02 → 5114.02] because he loved us,
[5114.14 → 5115.70] he took the punishment for us.
[5115.70 → 5117.88] So there is therefore now no condemnation
[5117.88 → 5119.88] for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[5121.68 → 5123.30] So we look to his compassion.
[5125.14 → 5126.76] And he does not condemn
[5126.76 → 5128.56] anyone who comes to him.
[5129.96 → 5130.40] Right?
[5130.52 → 5131.16] I'm going to say that again.
[5131.58 → 5133.56] Jesus does not condemn
[5133.56 → 5135.66] anyone who comes to him.
[5135.76 → 5136.54] He never will.
[5137.66 → 5138.52] He never has.
[5138.52 → 5141.74] But second,
[5142.12 → 5143.04] not only do we see
[5143.04 → 5144.66] the grace of Jesus' compassion,
[5144.88 → 5146.10] but we'll end with this,
[5146.18 → 5148.14] the truth of Jesus' compassion.
[5148.84 → 5149.90] To be a Christian means
[5149.90 → 5150.98] that we receive the grace
[5150.98 → 5152.16] and forgiveness of the Lord.
[5152.66 → 5152.98] Hallelujah.
[5154.34 → 5156.36] But we also receive the truth
[5156.36 → 5158.92] and the call to yield to him
[5158.92 → 5159.58] in obedience.
[5160.52 → 5161.36] And we see that
[5161.36 → 5162.52] in the final words
[5162.52 → 5163.92] of this passage in verse 11.
[5163.92 → 5167.20] Then neither I do
[5167.20 → 5168.14] I condemn you,
[5168.34 → 5169.10] Jesus declared.
[5169.56 → 5170.68] Go now
[5170.68 → 5171.52] and leave
[5171.52 → 5172.52] your life of sin.
[5173.58 → 5174.62] So this is not
[5174.62 → 5175.64] Jesus just saying,
[5176.22 → 5176.92] just follow
[5176.92 → 5178.18] wherever your desires
[5178.18 → 5178.80] take you.
[5179.02 → 5179.78] It doesn't matter
[5179.78 → 5180.56] what you do.
[5181.54 → 5181.82] Right?
[5181.96 → 5182.84] God loves you.
[5182.98 → 5183.78] Do whatever you want.
[5184.10 → 5184.22] Right?
[5184.26 → 5185.22] That's not what happens
[5185.22 → 5187.30] because Jesus loves you
[5187.30 → 5189.16] way too much
[5189.16 → 5189.98] to say that.
[5190.46 → 5191.32] He loves you
[5191.32 → 5192.08] and forgives you
[5192.08 → 5192.70] and that means
[5192.70 → 5194.22] he is going to transform you.
[5194.48 → 5195.82] His love will continue
[5195.82 → 5197.26] all throughout your life.
[5198.22 → 5198.34] You know,
[5198.38 → 5198.92] and right now
[5198.92 → 5199.48] in our culture
[5199.48 → 5200.32] we have the tendency
[5200.32 → 5200.94] to say,
[5201.30 → 5203.02] I like Jesus.
[5203.80 → 5205.60] I like his gentleness.
[5206.06 → 5207.40] I like his compassion,
[5207.74 → 5208.80] but he better not
[5208.80 → 5209.78] touch my sexuality.
[5210.52 → 5211.48] This is an area
[5211.48 → 5212.24] of my life
[5212.24 → 5213.94] that is off limits.
[5215.18 → 5215.40] Right?
[5215.50 → 5216.50] That kind of posture,
[5216.66 → 5216.82] friends,
[5216.88 → 5217.76] is impossible.
[5218.12 → 5218.86] It's impossible
[5218.86 → 5219.58] for a Christian.
[5220.62 → 5220.92] You know,
[5220.98 → 5221.86] we have all come
[5221.86 → 5222.28] to Jesus
[5222.28 → 5223.38] because we are broken.
[5223.52 → 5224.04] That's what it means
[5224.04 → 5224.58] to be a Christian.
[5225.26 → 5225.50] Right?
[5225.56 → 5226.30] You don't come to him
[5226.30 → 5226.56] and say,
[5226.64 → 5227.30] you are my saviour
[5227.30 → 5228.30] unless you are able
[5228.30 → 5229.00] to first say,
[5229.44 → 5230.16] I am a sinner.
[5230.92 → 5231.14] Lord,
[5231.24 → 5232.70] have mercy on me.
[5234.50 → 5235.26] We've all come
[5235.26 → 5236.02] to Jesus broken.
[5236.82 → 5237.62] We struggle
[5237.62 → 5238.48] and we fail
[5238.48 → 5239.32] in our thoughts
[5239.32 → 5240.84] and in our emotions
[5240.84 → 5242.22] and our relationships
[5242.22 → 5243.60] and in every area
[5243.60 → 5244.30] we are broken.
[5244.44 → 5245.18] Then are we going
[5245.18 → 5246.28] to really go to Jesus
[5246.28 → 5247.16] and tell him,
[5247.24 → 5248.06] but I am not broken
[5248.06 → 5248.76] in my sexuality.
[5248.76 → 5249.94] Thank you very much.
[5251.18 → 5251.68] Friends,
[5251.74 → 5252.64] if you want Jesus,
[5252.90 → 5253.80] you have to have
[5253.80 → 5254.40] all of him.
[5255.12 → 5255.82] It includes
[5255.82 → 5256.36] the forgiveness
[5256.36 → 5257.14] and the grace
[5257.14 → 5258.02] and it includes
[5258.02 → 5258.64] the willingness
[5258.64 → 5259.32] to obey
[5259.32 → 5260.14] and to follow him.
[5261.12 → 5261.82] And friends,
[5261.92 → 5262.40] that means
[5262.40 → 5263.12] for this woman,
[5263.32 → 5264.66] she is not able
[5264.66 → 5267.24] to follow her desires anymore.
[5267.50 → 5268.18] She is not able
[5268.18 → 5270.16] to act on them anymore.
[5270.76 → 5271.52] She doesn't get
[5271.52 → 5272.84] to follow her heart anymore
[5272.84 → 5273.64] because Jesus
[5273.64 → 5274.34] is calling her
[5274.34 → 5275.16] to a new life.
[5275.16 → 5276.58] She now has
[5276.58 → 5277.22] a new heart.
[5277.84 → 5278.26] She is given
[5278.26 → 5279.28] new desires.
[5279.92 → 5280.50] It's a desire
[5280.50 → 5281.38] to follow Jesus.
[5283.92 → 5284.48] John,
[5284.76 → 5285.68] in the opening
[5285.68 → 5286.40] of his gospel,
[5287.00 → 5287.74] says these
[5287.74 → 5288.84] amazing words,
[5289.84 → 5290.60] For the law
[5290.60 → 5291.22] was given
[5291.22 → 5291.94] through Moses,
[5293.14 → 5294.22] grace and truth
[5294.22 → 5294.98] came through
[5294.98 → 5295.64] Jesus Christ.
[5296.60 → 5297.40] And we must
[5297.40 → 5298.18] trust Jesus
[5298.18 → 5298.80] for both
[5298.80 → 5299.80] his grace
[5299.80 → 5301.30] and his truth.
[5302.50 → 5303.24] So brothers
[5303.24 → 5303.72] and sisters,
[5303.72 → 5305.34] how can we be healed
[5305.34 → 5306.46] of our sexual brokenness?
[5306.68 → 5307.82] We need to recognize
[5307.82 → 5309.64] our condemnation
[5309.64 → 5310.70] and then we need
[5310.70 → 5311.40] to go to Jesus.
[5312.30 → 5313.26] He forgives you,
[5313.70 → 5314.84] he restores you,
[5315.02 → 5316.32] and he has
[5316.32 → 5317.76] amazing compassion
[5317.76 → 5318.24] on you.
[5319.14 → 5320.16] Let's experience
[5320.16 → 5321.66] that together.
[5322.10 → 5322.26] Okay,
[5322.44 → 5323.04] let's pray.
[5325.40 → 5326.50] Our Heavenly Father,
[5326.72 → 5327.40] we thank you
[5327.40 → 5329.02] for this beautiful story,
[5330.12 → 5330.46] the story
[5330.46 → 5331.02] where we see
[5331.02 → 5331.78] Jesus
[5331.78 → 5333.98] and his compassion
[5333.98 → 5335.70] for the sexually
[5335.70 → 5336.10] broken.
[5337.00 → 5337.32] And Father,
[5337.44 → 5337.94] that is
[5337.94 → 5339.74] all of us
[5339.74 → 5340.60] this morning.
[5342.88 → 5343.54] And Lord,
[5343.60 → 5344.50] we can often feel
[5344.50 → 5345.34] so much shame
[5345.34 → 5346.64] in this area.
[5347.78 → 5348.42] And Lord,
[5348.48 → 5349.26] we can even
[5349.26 → 5350.26] know your grace
[5350.26 → 5351.34] but still think
[5351.34 → 5352.88] that maybe
[5352.88 → 5353.42] you're kind of
[5353.42 → 5354.46] disappointed with us.
[5356.00 → 5356.68] But Lord,
[5356.72 → 5357.36] when we look
[5357.36 → 5358.22] at Jesus,
[5358.84 → 5360.16] we see his eyes
[5360.16 → 5360.88] of compassion
[5360.88 → 5362.46] that are toward us.
[5363.32 → 5364.56] And he restores
[5364.56 → 5365.70] and he forgives us
[5365.70 → 5366.50] because he died
[5366.50 → 5367.20] in our place.
[5367.32 → 5367.84] He took all
[5367.84 → 5368.30] of the shame
[5368.30 → 5369.04] upon himself
[5369.04 → 5370.16] and all the
[5370.16 → 5370.84] condemnation
[5370.84 → 5371.58] upon himself
[5371.58 → 5373.20] to set us free.
[5374.06 → 5375.04] And he calls us
[5375.04 → 5375.68] to trust him
[5375.68 → 5376.74] and he calls us
[5376.74 → 5377.68] to follow him.
[5378.04 → 5378.28] Lord,
[5378.36 → 5379.08] by your spirit,
[5379.16 → 5380.06] would you enable us
[5380.06 → 5380.90] to do those things?
[5381.44 → 5382.72] We pray in Jesus' name.
[5383.22 → 5383.52] Amen.
[5386.52 → 5387.96] So let's stand
[5387.96 → 5389.18] and let's sing
[5389.18 → 5389.98] our song of response.
[5389.98 → 5390.10] Amen.
[5417.96 → 5431.04] In our days
[5431.04 → 5433.72] that God has numbered,
[5434.26 → 5438.76] I was made to walk with him.
[5438.76 → 5443.76] Yet I look for worldly treasure
[5443.76 → 5448.62] and forsake the King of kings.
[5449.04 → 5451.24] One night is holy,
[5451.86 → 5453.82] my Redeemer,
[5454.44 → 5455.90] though I call
[5455.90 → 5458.64] his love is sure.
[5459.00 → 5461.00] For Christ has paid
[5461.00 → 5463.84] for every failing.
[5463.84 → 5468.84] I am his forevermore.
[5468.84 → 5481.06] Mine are tears
[5481.06 → 5483.84] in times of sorrow,
[5484.46 → 5487.86] darkness not yet understood.
[5487.86 → 5491.24] Through the valley
[5491.24 → 5493.78] I must travel
[5493.78 → 5496.06] where I see
[5496.06 → 5498.68] no other day good.
[5499.08 → 5501.06] The might is peace
[5501.06 → 5503.92] that flows from heaven
[5503.92 → 5506.50] and the strength
[5506.50 → 5508.50] in times of me.
[5508.98 → 5511.00] I know my pain
[5511.00 → 5513.64] will not be wasted.
[5513.64 → 5515.54] Christ completes
[5515.54 → 5518.58] his work in me.
[5518.58 → 5531.82] Mine are days here
[5531.82 → 5533.78] as a stranger,
[5534.36 → 5538.80] pilgrim on a narrow way.
[5538.80 → 5540.92] One with Christ
[5540.92 → 5543.80] I will encounter
[5543.80 → 5546.04] harm and hatred
[5546.04 → 5548.48] for his name.
[5548.48 → 5551.14] But mine is armour
[5551.14 → 5553.78] for his battle
[5553.78 → 5555.48] strong enough
[5555.48 → 5558.52] to last the war.
[5558.86 → 5560.96] And he has said
[5560.96 → 5563.52] he will deliver
[5563.52 → 5565.98] safely to
[5565.98 → 5568.48] the golden shore.
[5569.02 → 5570.90] And mine are keys
[5570.90 → 5573.38] to Zion City
[5573.38 → 5575.12] where beside
[5575.12 → 5578.42] the King I walk.
[5578.82 → 5580.82] For there my heart
[5580.82 → 5583.54] has found its treasure.
[5584.10 → 5586.12] Christ is mine
[5586.12 → 5588.30] forevermore.
[5588.30 → 5591.74] I was perhaps
[5591.74 → 5592.86] for His love
[5592.86 → 5608.26] to clear
[5608.26 → 5610.40] and
[5610.40 → 5612.08] for His partisanship
[5612.08 → 5612.46] on the bottom
[5614.46 → 5614.92] OFAC
[5614.92 → 5616.28] provide
[5616.50 → 5625.50] But he has just been Eddie Boom, but he had and made in his water.
[5625.76 → 5633.82] And that there was one another person that we sensed that simply was,
[5634.08 → 5636.58] And that there she had just opened.
[5637.18 → 5640.60] And the man I experienced was didn't say anything,
[5640.60 → 5643.86] I interviewed that in just inches long ago,
[5643.86 → 5648.86] Christ is mine forevermore.
[5651.00 → 5660.58] And by the gates to Zion City, where beside the King I walk,
[5660.58 → 5670.58] for there my heart has found its treasure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[5670.58 → 5675.80] Christ is mine forevermore.
[5676.04 → 5680.50] Christ is mine forevermore.
[5694.90 → 5698.80] Go ahead and be seated. I do know the hour is getting a bit late.
[5698.80 → 5704.72] So let's still come before the Lord in a kind of shorter community prayer,
[5705.06 → 5707.24] and then we'll have our benediction. Let's pray.
[5708.46 → 5712.08] Father, we have so much to give you praise for this morning,
[5712.76 → 5718.04] for the gift of your word, for the gift of song in the Lord's Supper,
[5718.54 → 5723.46] for the gift of children, and also especially, Lord, again, of Nancy.
[5723.46 → 5729.56] Lord, we ask that you would bless her in her ministry, and would you build up your people,
[5730.24 → 5734.98] call more people, our neighbours, to come and know our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5735.38 → 5739.86] that he would also be theirs forevermore, just as he is ours.
[5739.86 → 5747.90] Lord, we give you thanks for Salem and Kia,
[5749.26 → 5753.06] Kenya, and their new child again.
[5753.32 → 5754.54] Lord, we thank you for that great gift.
[5754.64 → 5759.40] And we also give you thanks that the Lump's family is back with little Ezra.
[5759.94 → 5761.78] I met him yesterday. He's a handsome little guy.
[5761.78 → 5767.84] And Lord, we just ask that you would continue to help him to become adjusted to a new family,
[5768.74 → 5773.20] and that he would also know the love, not only of his family,
[5773.34 → 5775.80] but the love of his Lord Jesus Christ as well.
[5776.82 → 5782.92] Lord, we lift those in our church who are suffering with health issues and in many ways.
[5783.08 → 5785.60] Lord, we especially today pray for Joan,
[5785.60 → 5791.88] who has taken a downward turn in her struggle with cancer.
[5792.70 → 5798.20] Lord, we pray for the final treatment that the doctor wants to try.
[5799.30 → 5801.24] Lord, we pray that you would be with her,
[5801.66 → 5804.50] that the treatment would work well, and that you would heal her.
[5805.32 → 5806.94] Lord, we lift her up to you in prayer.
[5808.22 → 5811.46] Lord, we, again, we thank you for a time of worship today,
[5811.58 → 5814.22] and we pray all of these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5814.86 → 5815.14] Amen.
[5816.58 → 5818.46] So brothers and sisters, would you please rise?
[5823.18 → 5825.08] Hear these words of blessing.
[5826.42 → 5831.32] Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5831.32 → 5833.10] the great shepherd of the sheep,
[5833.58 → 5835.62] by the blood of the eternal covenant,
[5836.10 → 5839.32] equip you with everything good, that you may do his will,
[5839.90 → 5842.98] working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[5842.98 → 5847.66] through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[5847.66 → 5848.70] Amen.
[5848.70 → 5848.80] Amen.
[5848.80 → 5849.58] Amen.
[5849.64 → 5850.52] Amen.
[5850.52 → 5850.76] Amen.
[5850.76 → 5851.62] Amen.
[5851.62 → 5852.52] Amen.
[5852.70 → 5853.68] Amen.

[5854.40 → 5855.22] Amen.
[5855.22 → 5855.98] Amen.
[5855.98 → 5858.74] Amen.
[5858.74 → 5859.40] Amen.
[5859.44 → 5860.78] Amen.
[5861.46 → 5861.72] Amen.
[5861.80 → 5861.88] Amen.
[5862.04 → 5863.12] Amen.
[5863.38 → 5863.54] Amen.
[5863.54 → 5863.84] Amen.
[5863.84 → 5864.92] Amen.
[5865.32 → 5866.04] Amen.
[5866.12 → 5866.56] Amen.
[5866.70 → 5867.20] Amen.
[5867.26 → 5867.32] Amen.
[5867.84 → 5870.42] Amen.
[5870.42 → 5870.50] Amen.
[5870.50 → 5871.42] Amen.
[5871.50 → 5872.14] Amen.
