[270.00 → 283.72] Good morning.
[283.72 → 286.46] Thank you.
[286.46 → 290.76] Welcome to our worship service at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[291.70 → 296.88] We're happy you could be with us today, and if you're a visitor, we're especially pleased
[296.88 → 299.52] that you are able to be worshipping with us today.
[300.00 → 306.08] I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader today.
[306.08 → 309.42] Pastor Jason will be bringing us God's message.
[309.42 → 316.20] His sermon is Sacred Calling Sexuality.
[316.20 → 324.66] Today is the last day to see the charity sale of photography by Hans Du in the foyer.
[324.66 → 330.74] All donations from this charity sale will be donated to the Puts Charity, an NGO, a non-government
[330.74 → 338.54] organization based in Shanghai that helps abandoned children and children with special needs or
[338.54 → 339.74] in special need.
[339.74 → 346.54] Please see today's bulletin for details in purchasing a photograph.
[346.54 → 352.62] Today the offering is for Resonate Global Missions.
[352.62 → 360.62] We'll be watching a three-minute video shortly about Resonate Global Missions that we tried to play last week but couldn't.
[360.62 → 366.70] We are still not passing the collection plates.
[366.70 → 379.78] You can give your offering by dropping it off at the church, placing it in the boxes at the back of the church or the sanctuary, mailing it, or giving online.
[379.78 → 386.78] And next week the offering is for World Renew for World Hunger.
[386.78 → 390.78] It starts with the Holy Spirit.
[390.78 → 395.78] When the Holy Spirit works in someone's heart, God completely transforms them.
[395.78 → 400.78] And Christ's love echoes out into all areas of their life.
[400.78 → 402.78] This is God's mission.
[402.78 → 408.78] And the Holy Spirit invites each one of us to join in that mission.
[408.78 → 411.78] That's the work of Resonate Global Mission.
[411.78 → 419.78] The mission agency of the Christian Reformed Church, Resonate works to see more people experience Christ's love and live out their faith.
[419.78 → 424.78] The Christian Reformed Church has a long history of gospel witness.
[424.78 → 432.78] In fact, it started with the very first Christian Reformed congregation living out Christ's love in their community.
[432.78 → 435.78] But God's mission also stretches beyond our communities.
[435.78 → 440.78] And as a denomination group, churches came together to cross-cultural barriers.
[440.78 → 446.78] In 1888, the denomination's churches formed Christian Reformed Home Missions
[446.78 → 451.78] to share the gospel among indigenous populations within the United States.
[451.78 → 457.78] The work soon expanded overseas with a formation of Christian Reformed World Missions
[457.78 → 460.78] and sending missionaries to Nigeria and China.
[460.78 → 465.78] Since then, our involvement in God's mission has only grown.
[465.78 → 467.78] It has also changed.
[467.78 → 472.78] The world looks a lot different today than it did a century and a half ago.
[472.78 → 477.78] With travel and technology, our connected world has broken down barriers.
[477.78 → 480.78] Today, people groups move and relocate.
[480.78 → 485.78] Refugees flee their homes and seek safety in other countries.
[485.78 → 491.78] In many of our neighbourhoods, it's common to hear languages spoken from all over the world,
[491.78 → 497.78] smell food from a variety of cultures, and see different types of clothing.
[497.78 → 501.78] All these changes mean that ministry changes too.
[501.78 → 508.78] That's why in 2017, Christian Reformed Home Missions and Christian Reformed World Missions
[508.78 → 512.78] joined together to become Resonate Global Mission.
[512.78 → 515.78] We are one agency with one mission.
[515.78 → 521.78] To see communities of disciples faithfully proclaiming and living out the good news of Jesus.
[521.78 → 526.78] Through Resonate, the Christian Reformed Church is working in more than 40 countries,
[526.78 → 529.78] including Canada and the United States.
[529.78 → 536.78] We send missionaries and volunteers, plant churches, support campus ministries,
[536.78 → 541.78] and train churches and people to live out the gospel in their own communities.
[541.78 → 544.78] We work through three key strategies.
[544.78 → 551.78] Forming leaders, sending congregations, and connecting networks.
[551.78 → 554.78] You play an important role in this mission too.
[554.78 → 558.78] Jesus sends all of his followers into the world as his witnesses.
[558.78 → 561.78] Some are called down the street.
[561.78 → 564.78] And others to the other side of the world.
[564.78 → 570.78] Resonate is here to help you and your church find your place in God's mission.
[570.78 → 573.78] We will help you deepen your passion for mission.
[573.78 → 577.78] Strengthen your capacity to follow God on mission.
[577.78 → 582.78] And amplify the impact you and your church have in your neighbourhood and around the world.
[582.78 → 590.78] Near and far, our church follows the Holy Spirit's call to share the grace, hope, and love found in Jesus.
[590.78 → 594.78] We join the whole church to share the whole gospel with the whole world.
[594.78 → 598.78] And we can do more together than we can ever do on our own.
[598.78 → 604.78] We join the whole church.
[604.78 → 605.78] Will you join us?
[605.78 → 619.22] Please stand if you are able for our call to worship.
[627.16 → 631.32] Let us worship God, our light and our salvation.
[631.32 → 637.32] The Lord is the stronghold of our lives.
[637.32 → 644.52] We desire to live in God's house and to seek God in His holy temple.
[644.52 → 652.00] We have come with shouts of joy to sing and make music to the Lord.
[652.00 → 656.70] Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[656.70 → 664.52] Teach us your ways and make straight our paths in this hour of worship and always.
[664.52 → 671.52] The Lord greets you with these words from Zephaniah 3 verse 17.
[671.52 → 680.00] The Lord your God is with you, the mighty warrior who saves.
[680.00 → 683.24] He will take great delight in you.
[683.24 → 691.66] In His love, He will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.
[691.66 → 698.66] As God has greeted us, so let us greet each other.
[698.66 → 699.88] from the Lord Holy zip,
[699.88 → 701.66] He will no longer be notations.
[701.66 → 704.12] I am when mile with beam his power up.
[705.32 → 707.34] A program like God star the Lord.
[707.34 → 708.54] A means of ISIP that I am withoutains, above my initial mind.
[708.54 → 711.38] I have to pray for that, and if he expects you to enter us moving.
[712.00 → 714.12] I am.
[714.12 → 717.32] Lady.
[717.32 → 720.64] I know from Jonathan to give a Vélez, as a horse a tiger colour with God,
[720.66 → 722.58] he will hide his lips.
[722.86 → 725.62] 第二 base of God shall not be able for God.
[725.62 → 727.68] One month of faith, because he takes five years to make life.
[727.68 → 751.78] Today is a significant day in our church history.
[751.78 → 761.54] 504 years ago, on October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses on the door of the
[761.54 → 769.26] Kassel Church in Wittenberg, Germany, a move that would begin the Protestant Reformation.
[769.26 → 776.32] We are thankful to God that through His grace, He continues to transform and renew our lives
[776.32 → 779.12] as we worship and honour Him.
[779.12 → 783.24] And for our first song this morning, we're going to sing Martin Luther's powerful hymn,
[783.82 → 785.68] A Mighty Fortress is Our God.
[785.68 → 805.92] A Mighty Fortress is Our God, A whole world never failing.
[805.92 → 816.92] Our Helper, He, A living of love, O mortal is prevailing.
[816.92 → 825.92] For still our ancient foe, does seem to work us whole.
[825.92 → 835.92] His craft and power are great, and armed with rule were made.
[835.92 → 842.92] All earth is not His equal.
[842.92 → 853.92] Did we in our own strength confine, Our striving would be losing?
[853.92 → 865.92] We're not the right man on our side, The man of God's own choosing.
[865.92 → 866.92] We are GORDON South icky, itself is our Lord, and he is in our country.
[866.92 → 867.92] We regard-owned King.
[867.92 → 888.72] You ask boon, man, gave thee ANYMORE THAT'S PERFECTING,
[888.72 → 898.72] And though this holy devil's bear
[898.72 → 904.72] Should battle to undo us
[904.72 → 910.06] We will not fear, nor God has will
[910.06 → 916.08] His truth to triumph through us
[916.08 → 920.98] The Prince of darkness brave
[920.98 → 925.48] We tremble not for him
[925.48 → 930.08] His great dream can endure
[930.08 → 935.08] For though his doom is sure
[935.08 → 940.08] One little word shall peril
[940.08 → 947.98] The kingdom of all earthly crimes
[947.98 → 953.98] No, thanks to them abided
[953.98 → 959.98] The Spirit and the gifts arise
[959.98 → 965.88] Through him who we're not sighted
[965.88 → 971.38] Let the trumpet red gold
[971.38 → 975.88] This mortal life, O soul
[975.88 → 980.78] The body they may kill
[980.78 → 985.78] God's truth abide still
[985.78 → 993.78] His kingdom is forever
[993.78 → 1012.68] Blessing and honour
[1012.68 → 1015.48] Glory and power
[1015.48 → 1020.08] Heal to the ancient of days
[1020.08 → 1025.98] From every nation, all creation

[1039.98 → 1045.88] In worship, you will be exalted, all of God
[1045.88 → 1050.38] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[1050.38 → 1053.28] O ancient of days
[1053.28 → 1055.28] O ancient of days
[1055.28 → 1059.78] Let's sing and honour

[1066.28 → 1072.18] From every nation, all creation
[1072.18 → 1076.18] Poured for the ancient of days
[1076.18 → 1080.18] Every tongue in heaven I long
[1080.18 → 1082.18] Shall declare your glory
[1082.18 → 1085.18] Every knee shall bow at your throne
[1085.18 → 1091.18] In worship, you will be exalted, all of God
[1091.18 → 1095.18] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[1095.18 → 1097.08] O ancient of days
[1097.08 → 1099.58] O ancient of days
[1099.58 → 1102.08] O ancient of days
[1102.08 → 1106.08] A kingdom shall reign over all the earth
[1106.08 → 1110.08] Sing to the ancient of days
[1110.08 → 1112.08] O ancient of days
[1112.08 → 1116.08] O none can come back to your matchless world
[1116.08 → 1120.08] Sing to the ancient of days
[1120.08 → 1121.98] Every tongue in heaven I long
[1121.98 → 1125.98] Every tongue in heaven I long
[1125.98 → 1127.98] Shall declare your glory
[1127.98 → 1130.98] Every knee shall bow at your throne
[1130.98 → 1135.98] In worship, you will be exalted, all of God
[1135.98 → 1140.48] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[1140.48 → 1142.98] O ancient of days
[1142.98 → 1144.88] Amen
[1144.88 → 1146.88] Amen
[1146.88 → 1150.78] Amen
[1150.78 → 1179.22] I cast my eye to Calvary
[1180.78 → 1187.38] Where Jesus bled and died for me
[1187.38 → 1194.18] I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
[1194.18 → 1202.38] My Saviour on that cursed tree
[1202.38 → 1210.98] His body bowed and drenched in tears
[1210.98 → 1217.38] They laid Him down in justice too
[1217.38 → 1223.98] The entrance sealed by heavy snow
[1223.98 → 1231.38] The Messiah still and all alone
[1231.38 → 1242.98] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God
[1242.98 → 1248.98] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[1248.98 → 1255.58] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[1255.58 → 1261.58] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God
[1261.58 → 1272.18] Moon of earth, a great come dawn
[1272.18 → 1279.18] The sun of heaven, rose the earth
[1279.18 → 1285.18] Oh, trample-tell, where is your sting?
[1285.18 → 1295.78] The angels born for Christ the King
[1295.78 → 1302.18] He shall return in robes of white
[1302.18 → 1308.78] The raising song shall pierce the night
[1308.78 → 1315.38] Then I will rise among the saints
[1315.38 → 1322.38] My face transpired on Jesus' face
[1322.38 → 1332.98] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God
[1332.98 → 1338.98] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[1338.98 → 1345.98] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[1345.98 → 1348.58] Oh, Lord our God
[1348.58 → 1354.58] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[1354.58 → 1358.58] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[1358.58 → 1362.58] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[1362.58 → 1364.58] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[1364.58 → 1365.58] Oh, Lord our God
[1365.58 → 1366.58] Praise His name forevermore
[1366.58 → 1373.18] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[1373.18 → 1377.18] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God
[1377.18 → 1379.18] Oh, Lord our God
[1379.18 → 1383.18] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God
[1383.18 → 1385.18] Oh, Lord our God
[1385.18 → 1387.18] Oh, Lord our God
[1387.18 → 1409.78] For our time of confession
[1409.78 → 1415.18] Let us confess our sins before God and one another
[1415.18 → 1421.18] With this prayer of confession from 1 John 1, verses 8 and 9
[1421.18 → 1425.68] We will have a moment of silent prayer at the end
[1425.68 → 1430.08] God's word assures us
[1430.08 → 1432.72] If we say we have no sin
[1432.72 → 1436.98] We deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us
[1436.98 → 1441.18] If we confess our sins
[1441.18 → 1446.82] He who is faithful will forgive our sins
[1446.82 → 1451.18] And cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1451.18 → 1454.30] In humility and faith
[1454.30 → 1457.08] Let us confess our sins to God
[1457.08 → 1459.22] In a moment of silent prayer
[1466.98 → 1475.68] Thank you, our Heavenly Father
[1475.68 → 1477.72] For hearing our prayers
[1477.72 → 1478.82] Amen
[1478.82 → 1487.52] God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of our sin
[1487.52 → 1492.36] Is from Isaiah 44, verses 21 and 22
[1492.36 → 1496.80] Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel
[1496.80 → 1498.62] For you are my servant
[1498.62 → 1500.60] I formed you
[1500.60 → 1502.58] You are my servant
[1502.58 → 1504.24] O Israel
[1504.24 → 1507.26] You will not be forgotten by me
[1507.26 → 1511.10] I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud
[1511.10 → 1513.82] And your sin like a mist
[1513.82 → 1515.82] Return to me
[1515.82 → 1517.96] For I have redeemed you
[1517.96 → 1522.62] We will now have our song of response
[1522.62 → 1524.44] And after the song
[1524.44 → 1527.26] The children ages 3 to grade 7
[1527.26 → 1530.34] Are welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School
[1530.34 → 1551.00] Not what my hands have done
[1551.00 → 1555.64] Can save my guilty soul
[1555.64 → 1562.82] Not what my toiling flesh has bought
[1562.82 → 1568.20] And make my spirit whole
[1568.20 → 1573.68] Not what I feel or do
[1573.68 → 1579.38] Can give me peace with God
[1579.38 → 1585.20] Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
[1585.20 → 1590.58] Can bear my awful hope
[1590.58 → 1597.58] Your voice alone, O Lord
[1597.58 → 1602.66] Will speak to me of praise
[1602.66 → 1609.50] Your power alone, O Son of God
[1609.50 → 1614.88] And all my sin he prays
[1614.88 → 1621.06] No other work but yours
[1621.06 → 1626.68] No other power will do
[1626.68 → 1632.96] No strength of that which is divine
[1632.96 → 1633.96] And all my sin he prays
[1633.96 → 1634.96] And all my sin he prays
[1634.96 → 1635.96] And all my sin he prays
[1635.96 → 1637.96] And all my sin he prays
[1637.96 → 1639.96] And all my sin he prays
[1639.96 → 1646.02] I pray the Christ of God
[1646.02 → 1649.96] I rest on the divine
[1649.96 → 1656.96] And with a cold dream live and hide
[1656.96 → 1662.34] I call this second life
[1662.34 → 1668.34] I know to save my life
[1668.34 → 1673.96] And freely pardoned his
[1673.96 → 1680.34] I love because he first loved me
[1680.34 → 1681.44] Within time I am
[1681.44 → 1684.96] I will give ice
[1684.96 → 1690.88] You are SP Wins
[1690.88 → 1692.72] And too many who cannot forgive you
[1692.72 → 1692.76] I hope I Thy cur
[1692.76 → 1694.46] I'm laid
[1694.46 → 1695.28] I wake up
[1695.28 → 1697.60] You are SP textbook
[1697.60 → 1698.44] God

[1703.38 → 1704.50] A
[1704.50 → 1705.80] We are
[1705.80 → 1706.24] To
[1706.24 → 1736.22] Thank you.
[1736.24 → 1746.44] First, Covenants 6.12-20. New International Version. Sexual Immortality.
[1746.44 → 1758.08] I have the right to do anything, you say, but not everything is beneficial. I have the right to do anything, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[1758.08 → 1766.72] You say, foot for the stomach and the stomach for foot, and God will destroy them both.
[1767.48 → 1772.38] The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the law.
[1773.24 → 1780.58] The law for the body. By his power, God raised the law from the dead, and he will raise us also.
[1780.58 → 1790.96] Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a positive? Never.
[1791.80 → 1798.44] Do you not know that he who unites himself with positive is not one with her in body?
[1798.44 → 1807.92] For it is said, the two will become one flesh, but whoever is united with God is one with him in spirit.
[1808.94 → 1810.96] Free from sexual immorality.
[1811.80 → 1819.92] All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.
[1819.92 → 1828.00] Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you receive from God?
[1828.60 → 1832.28] You are not your own. You were bought at a price.
[1833.14 → 1835.76] Therefore, honour God with your bodies.
[1836.78 → 1838.48] This is the word of the Lord.
[1839.38 → 1840.34] Thank you, Lord.
[1848.70 → 1849.46] Good morning.
[1849.92 → 1854.18] It's great to be with you and to worship the Lord with you this morning.
[1854.94 → 1861.48] So last week we began a shorter four-week series called Sacred Calling.
[1862.08 → 1871.96] It's looking at God's design for marriage, for sex, for singleness, and his great grace to us in all of these areas in the gospel.
[1873.78 → 1877.66] So we began last week first looking at marriage. That's the foundation.
[1877.66 → 1881.84] And we looked at Genesis chapter 2, and we saw kind of two things about marriage.
[1881.92 → 1883.82] That marriage first is complementary.
[1884.58 → 1887.94] It's about a man and a woman singing together in harmony.
[1888.46 → 1895.30] And we also saw that marriage is a picture of Christ's covenantal love for his bride, the church.
[1895.30 → 1902.32] And so with that in mind, today we are going to consider the topic of sex.
[1902.32 → 1910.92] Sometimes, you know, people say, oh, the church is so obsessed with talking about sex.
[1911.28 → 1914.14] I mean, I've been preaching for nine years. I've only preached on it once before.
[1915.40 → 1918.58] So this is, well...
[1918.58 → 1926.88] Before we get into this topic, and before I pray, I just want to say that for a lot of us, this is a really sensitive topic.
[1927.98 → 1935.98] You know, we live in a world with so much brokenness when it comes to our sexuality, and none of us are unaffected.
[1935.98 → 1941.26] So today as we look into this topic of sexuality, you know, we're not going to...
[1941.26 → 1942.44] We can't touch on everything.
[1943.38 → 1949.26] But if this does touch on some particular area that you are personally struggling with,
[1949.32 → 1954.82] whether your experience is as a sexual sinner or a sexual sufferer,
[1955.46 → 1957.74] please know that you can come and talk to me.
[1958.20 → 1960.88] You can come, and you can talk to your elder.
[1960.88 → 1964.00] Father, you know, because we want to be a church that cares for one another,
[1964.70 → 1967.44] that supports one another in this area.
[1968.30 → 1971.48] So let me pray before we begin and as we look into this.
[1973.38 → 1979.82] Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are the God who wants to be with us.
[1981.08 → 1984.34] You are the great lover of our souls.
[1985.60 → 1988.46] You are the one that we were made for.
[1988.46 → 1991.98] And you are the one who truly knows us.
[1992.40 → 1995.28] And you want to draw us to yourself.
[1995.46 → 1996.58] You want to heal us.
[1997.16 → 1998.40] You want to restore us.
[1999.50 → 2002.18] And I pray today that you would do these things in us.
[2002.78 → 2007.38] Lord, would you remove any obstacles in our hearts
[2007.38 → 2010.76] that would prevent us from hearing your word to us.
[2012.28 → 2014.84] Lord, would your Holy Spirit be at work.
[2016.08 → 2017.30] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2018.12 → 2018.40] Amen.
[2018.46 → 2018.60] Amen.
[2021.40 → 2024.04] So, we're in 1 Corinthians.
[2024.46 → 2027.90] The city of Corinth in the ancient world was famous
[2027.90 → 2032.66] for its temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite.
[2033.82 → 2036.62] And connected with the worship of the goddess
[2036.62 → 2040.44] was this whole system of temple prostitution
[2040.44 → 2044.22] where there would actually be 1,000 prostitutes
[2044.22 → 2050.56] who would actually come down from the temple mount into the city every night.
[2050.56 → 2057.30] And so, culturally, the city of Corinth was renowned for its wanton sexuality.
[2057.74 → 2064.48] So much so that to Corinthian actually meant to fornicate.
[2064.48 → 2069.78] The name of the city meant sexual indulgence with no limits.
[2069.78 → 2074.96] And it was a big issue not only in the culture but inside the church as well.
[2075.06 → 2077.18] It was something that the Corinthian church was struggling with.
[2077.18 → 2082.76] So, when it comes to views about sex in our day,
[2082.76 → 2087.50] there are two common views of sex out there.
[2087.50 → 2090.04] First, there's the traditional view.
[2090.04 → 2096.92] The traditional view of sex is that you would find much in the developing world.
[2096.92 → 2099.54] You'd find much in the Muslim world.
[2099.54 → 2103.14] And you would find in the Western world not even too long ago.
[2103.46 → 2104.74] It would have looked like this.
[2104.82 → 2106.18] Go back, Julia, to the picture.
[2108.00 → 2109.96] The world we used to live in looked like this.
[2110.28 → 2111.10] I don't know if you can read it.
[2111.60 → 2115.66] Moses says, well, actually, they are written in stone.
[2116.72 → 2118.20] I think it's hilarious.
[2119.88 → 2124.10] And that is, when it comes to sex, it was written in stone, right?
[2124.18 → 2125.80] No sex outside of marriage.
[2125.80 → 2127.56] That's what the Bible teaches.
[2127.86 → 2132.14] And then, other than that simple fact and teaching,
[2132.58 → 2137.24] sex is often one of those topics that, in churches, we just don't like to talk about.
[2137.82 → 2138.22] Right?
[2138.28 → 2139.70] We don't talk about sex.
[2139.96 → 2140.60] We're Christians.
[2142.14 → 2148.76] But what comes out of that is you come to believe that sex is something dirty
[2148.76 → 2150.72] or is something that's shameful.
[2151.98 → 2154.50] And in the Corinthian church that Paul is writing to,
[2154.50 → 2156.74] there was a group like this.
[2157.24 → 2165.22] And they'd have a slogan where some people would say things like what we see in chapter 7, verse 1.
[2165.32 → 2166.30] So let's put that up there, Julia.
[2166.96 → 2169.08] Where they would say, right, in quote,
[2170.02 → 2173.52] so Paul, you know, there are these slogans that Paul is quoting and then responding to.
[2173.52 → 2178.24] So they would say, it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
[2179.88 → 2181.06] That's what some people were saying.
[2181.68 → 2185.54] And that is very much what a lot of us has grown up with, kind of that impression.
[2185.98 → 2186.66] It's not good.
[2188.14 → 2193.36] Now, opposed to that, in reaction to that, is a progressive view of sex.
[2193.42 → 2196.18] And the progressive view of sex looks like this.
[2196.18 → 2200.32] But the Ten Commandments, do it yourself kit.
[2201.92 → 2207.86] See, not having sex outside of marriage is a Christian virtue.
[2208.50 → 2212.98] But it is the most unpopular Christian virtue there is.
[2214.42 → 2219.96] Sex is to be reserved for marriage with complete faithfulness to your spouse,
[2219.96 → 2222.76] or else, total abstinence.
[2223.48 → 2226.66] And our modern culture says, that's absurd.
[2227.34 → 2229.68] Like, that is repressive.
[2230.80 → 2234.12] Instead, they say, we have something else we need to offer.
[2234.92 → 2238.66] And so this is what our progressive view in our modern culture says about sex.
[2238.66 → 2242.12] That sex is nothing, and that sex is everything.
[2242.96 → 2243.84] Both at the same time.
[2245.28 → 2248.82] First, the progressive view of sex is that sex is nothing.
[2249.96 → 2252.08] And people have this view in Paul's day as well.
[2252.18 → 2254.62] So in verse 12, as we see up here,
[2254.94 → 2258.90] Paul quotes another slogan that some people in the church in Corinth were saying.
[2258.96 → 2261.28] They would say, I have the right to do anything.
[2262.52 → 2265.12] And then in verse 13, they would say,
[2265.30 → 2267.72] food for the stomach and the stomach for food,
[2268.00 → 2269.28] and God will destroy them both.
[2270.56 → 2270.78] Right?
[2270.86 → 2273.04] In other words, sex is nothing.
[2273.82 → 2277.06] Sex is just like food for the stomach.
[2277.18 → 2278.16] It's just an appetite.
[2279.00 → 2279.24] Right?
[2279.24 → 2279.84] You're hungry?
[2280.00 → 2280.46] What do you do?
[2281.12 → 2282.68] You go to the fridge, and you get a snack.
[2283.24 → 2284.14] You want sex?
[2284.56 → 2288.08] Well, you just go out and satisfy that appetite as well.
[2288.18 → 2288.84] That was the view.
[2289.76 → 2291.72] And then this idea that sex is an appetite,
[2292.08 → 2294.94] that is that, what it means is it's just harmless.
[2295.32 → 2297.48] You know, as it says, God's going to destroy them both anyway.
[2298.60 → 2300.90] You know, you eat something, and it passes through your body,
[2300.96 → 2302.28] and there's no real harm to you.
[2303.34 → 2305.00] And sex is the same way, people would say.
[2305.08 → 2307.24] Sex doesn't have any spiritual significance.
[2307.24 → 2308.02] It's harmless.
[2308.12 → 2309.32] It's just a bodily appetite.
[2311.62 → 2314.02] You know, when I was thinking about this,
[2314.12 → 2317.24] this very kind of well-known quote by C.S. Lewis came to mind.
[2317.88 → 2321.14] So this is what C.S. Lewis says about this in his book,
[2321.26 → 2321.84] Mere Christianity.
[2321.84 → 2323.84] He says,
[2323.84 → 2327.64] you can get a large audience together for a striptease act,
[2328.18 → 2330.56] that is, to watch a girl undress on stage.
[2331.64 → 2333.46] Now, suppose you came to a country
[2333.46 → 2335.46] where you could fill a theatre
[2335.46 → 2339.78] by simply bringing a covered plate onto the stage
[2339.78 → 2342.46] and then slowly lifting the cover
[2342.46 → 2346.14] to let everyone see,
[2346.24 → 2347.96] just before the lights went out,
[2348.50 → 2350.14] that it contained a mutton chop
[2350.14 → 2351.68] or a bit of bacon.
[2352.52 → 2354.34] Would you not think that in that country
[2354.34 → 2358.06] something has gone wrong with the appetite for food?
[2359.34 → 2362.24] And would not anyone who had grown up in a different world
[2362.24 → 2365.36] think there was something equally odd
[2365.36 → 2369.20] about the state of the sexual instinct among us?
[2369.20 → 2370.94] So you see what he's saying?
[2371.00 → 2372.96] He's saying that if you could get far enough
[2372.96 → 2375.84] away from our culture to observe it from a distance,
[2376.02 → 2377.34] you would look at it, and you say,
[2377.42 → 2379.60] this is kind of out of control.
[2381.64 → 2383.82] So sex is nothing.
[2384.04 → 2385.14] It's just a bodily need.
[2385.28 → 2388.20] That's what one part of the view is.
[2389.60 → 2392.70] But the other part of the view
[2392.70 → 2395.00] that's just so prevalent in our culture today
[2395.00 → 2397.58] is that sex is everything.
[2397.58 → 2401.38] You see, sex in our culture is seen
[2401.38 → 2404.88] as the ultimate source of happiness
[2404.88 → 2406.86] and self-realization.
[2408.06 → 2411.20] And the idea is that you are given this appetite
[2411.20 → 2414.22] in order to find out what you enjoy
[2414.22 → 2416.86] and then to use that to express yourself
[2416.86 → 2419.86] and to project that onto your identity.
[2420.48 → 2420.82] Right?
[2420.88 → 2423.10] It's part of being yourself and finding yourself.
[2423.54 → 2425.26] Sex is for personal fulfillment
[2425.26 → 2427.14] and self-realization.
[2427.58 → 2429.88] Do you see how it's become everything?
[2430.04 → 2430.88] It's become ultimate.
[2431.02 → 2434.88] It's become so tied up and bound up with who you are.
[2436.12 → 2438.40] So in Paul's day and in our own,
[2438.56 → 2440.20] people were saying those two things.
[2440.26 → 2441.16] That sex is nothing
[2441.16 → 2442.76] and that sex is everything.
[2442.76 → 2448.30] We live in a culture that believes in free sex,
[2448.70 → 2451.40] casual sex, high use of pornography.
[2452.54 → 2456.20] And as our culture screams for this freedom,
[2457.26 → 2460.50] the mere suggestion of restraint
[2460.50 → 2464.96] or moral restriction is met with great offence
[2464.96 → 2466.76] and great outrage.
[2466.76 → 2470.14] But friends, just think about how destructive
[2470.14 → 2472.12] this view of sex is.
[2473.18 → 2477.12] Think about the trail of wreckage in families
[2477.12 → 2481.00] where affairs and porn addiction
[2481.00 → 2484.30] and no-faulted divorce are justified by saying,
[2484.30 → 2486.66] you weren't meeting my needs,
[2486.66 → 2488.46] so I just had to go look elsewhere.
[2490.12 → 2490.22] Right?
[2490.28 → 2493.30] Think of all the singles out there who are dating
[2493.30 → 2495.90] and feel pressured into sex
[2495.90 → 2499.18] because it's expected and even demanded of you.
[2499.60 → 2499.78] Right?
[2499.86 → 2500.96] Even if you don't want it.
[2502.38 → 2505.60] Think about how you are told that your value as a person
[2505.60 → 2509.44] is measured by how much sex appeal you have,
[2509.44 → 2510.92] especially if you are a woman.
[2512.84 → 2515.40] And in this world where we actually have more sex
[2515.40 → 2516.68] readily available to us
[2516.68 → 2518.36] than almost at any other time in history,
[2519.14 → 2521.22] right, you have dating apps,
[2521.48 → 2522.82] you have online hookups,
[2522.92 → 2525.12] you have pornography on your phone,
[2525.18 → 2527.04] you've got everything available to you,
[2527.50 → 2529.14] and yet research is showing that people
[2529.14 → 2531.82] are having less sex than ever before.
[2532.96 → 2534.76] From Japan to Denmark,
[2535.28 → 2536.70] governments are worried about this.
[2537.12 → 2539.42] And studies are showing even younger people
[2539.42 → 2541.38] are not having sex.
[2543.16 → 2545.50] But do you know who research shows
[2545.50 → 2548.06] is the most satisfied with their sex lives?
[2549.60 → 2550.40] Married couples.
[2552.40 → 2554.38] And this progressive view, we're told,
[2554.56 → 2555.94] is sexual liberation.
[2557.20 → 2558.62] But look how Paul responds.
[2559.64 → 2560.62] To those who claim,
[2560.88 → 2562.76] I have the right to do anything,
[2563.12 → 2563.78] Paul says,
[2563.90 → 2567.02] but I will not be mastered by anything.
[2568.14 → 2568.28] Right?
[2568.28 → 2569.74] Christianity is freedom.
[2570.88 → 2571.78] So he's saying,
[2572.38 → 2575.36] look, don't use this freedom that you have
[2575.36 → 2578.34] to actually go back into slavery.
[2578.78 → 2581.74] When you're ruled by your sexual appetizing,
[2581.84 → 2584.00] you just give into those and follow them.
[2584.24 → 2587.92] Or when you do just whatever the surrounding culture
[2587.92 → 2589.28] is expecting and saying,
[2589.36 → 2590.90] what happens is not freedom,
[2591.14 → 2592.46] but actually slavery.
[2592.46 → 2594.68] But friends,
[2594.78 → 2598.10] the Bible has a much more beautiful,
[2598.42 → 2599.90] much more freeing vision
[2599.90 → 2602.08] of sexuality and sex.
[2602.84 → 2605.04] Modern culture tells us that sex is about,
[2605.48 → 2606.58] it's all about how you look
[2606.58 → 2608.30] and what you can do in the bedroom.
[2608.86 → 2609.48] But Paul says,
[2609.62 → 2609.80] no,
[2610.26 → 2611.30] sex is about the gospel.
[2612.58 → 2613.38] In sex,
[2613.48 → 2615.36] you are reenacting the gospel.
[2615.36 → 2616.86] You're saying to your spouse
[2616.86 → 2619.28] what Jesus says to us,
[2619.34 → 2619.84] the church,
[2620.16 → 2622.08] that I see you completely
[2622.08 → 2624.34] and that I love you completely.
[2624.96 → 2626.24] That's what sex is.
[2627.76 → 2629.22] So let's look at this passage
[2629.22 → 2630.74] and see what it tells us
[2630.74 → 2632.06] about God's view of sex.
[2632.58 → 2633.42] Because actually,
[2633.50 → 2633.74] you know what?
[2633.82 → 2634.96] Sex is God's idea.
[2635.80 → 2638.36] It's God's gift to us
[2638.36 → 2641.00] for our flourishing
[2641.00 → 2643.00] when it's used within marriage.
[2644.48 → 2644.64] Okay,
[2644.68 → 2645.04] so just,
[2645.18 → 2646.34] I want to look at three kinds of,
[2646.90 → 2648.06] three simple things.
[2648.14 → 2649.54] We can't say all that much here,
[2649.64 → 2651.78] but three things about sex
[2651.78 → 2652.58] that we see in this passage.
[2652.72 → 2653.38] So the first,
[2654.34 → 2655.98] sex in the Bible is good.
[2657.12 → 2658.02] That's the first thing.
[2658.68 → 2659.04] And friends,
[2659.08 → 2660.74] this is so important for us to hear.
[2661.38 → 2662.62] It's not nothing.
[2663.54 → 2664.68] It's not everything.
[2665.18 → 2666.64] It's not bad or shameful.
[2666.64 → 2666.80] It's not bad or sinful.
[2667.70 → 2669.30] It's very good.
[2670.18 → 2671.02] And you see that
[2671.02 → 2672.42] when God created a man and a woman,
[2672.56 → 2673.36] it says in Genesis
[2673.36 → 2676.06] that they were naked and unashamed.
[2676.16 → 2677.20] There was no shame.
[2677.94 → 2679.66] And they were created by God,
[2679.74 → 2680.76] we are created by God,
[2680.80 → 2681.72] as human beings,
[2682.26 → 2684.14] wired for sexual intimacy.
[2684.92 → 2687.18] Where nothing is hidden,
[2687.86 → 2688.76] this intimacy, right?
[2688.80 → 2689.68] Where nothing is hidden,
[2690.04 → 2691.98] where you feel completely safe,
[2692.08 → 2693.42] at ease in your own body,
[2693.84 → 2694.68] completely known,
[2694.72 → 2695.88] and completely loved.
[2695.88 → 2698.22] That is at the heart
[2698.22 → 2699.94] of God's good design for sex.
[2701.64 → 2702.42] And do you know
[2702.42 → 2703.76] what is the first commandment
[2703.76 → 2704.34] in the Bible?
[2707.04 → 2709.36] Be fruitful and multiply.
[2710.24 → 2711.42] And there's only one way
[2711.42 → 2712.28] you can do that, isn't there?
[2713.86 → 2715.66] When God created Adam and Eve,
[2715.74 → 2716.76] he put them in a garden,
[2716.88 → 2717.68] and he wasn't like,
[2718.70 → 2719.00] you know,
[2719.46 → 2720.72] hey, what are you guys doing?
[2720.94 → 2721.82] Stop doing that.
[2722.76 → 2723.72] He wasn't saying that.
[2723.72 → 2725.14] When God created Adam and Eve,
[2725.56 → 2727.22] he made sex for them,
[2727.30 → 2728.00] and he's saying,
[2728.52 → 2729.58] this is good.
[2731.88 → 2732.70] And look,
[2732.76 → 2733.72] if you don't believe me,
[2734.34 → 2735.10] in the Bible,
[2735.20 → 2737.04] there is a whole book of the Bible,
[2737.22 → 2738.02] the Song of Songs,
[2738.14 → 2740.40] which is an erotic love poem,
[2740.46 → 2741.08] the whole thing.
[2741.86 → 2743.20] And throughout history,
[2743.32 → 2743.94] a lot of people
[2743.94 → 2745.52] were very embarrassed by this.
[2746.22 → 2747.56] Jewish boys were not allowed
[2747.56 → 2748.18] to read it.
[2748.18 → 2750.94] And what it is,
[2750.98 → 2752.80] it's a husband and a wife
[2752.80 → 2754.96] who are delighting
[2754.96 → 2756.42] in each other's bodies.
[2757.52 → 2759.26] And they're feeling joy
[2759.26 → 2760.48] and sexual intimacy.
[2760.98 → 2762.34] And this is in the Bible.
[2764.34 → 2765.94] And God says this is good.
[2767.82 → 2768.90] So for those of us
[2768.90 → 2769.48] who are married,
[2770.18 → 2771.12] let me ask you a question.
[2771.12 → 2775.02] When did you last express
[2775.02 → 2777.26] appreciation for your spouse's body?
[2779.26 → 2779.46] Right?
[2779.58 → 2781.04] When did you maybe say,
[2781.30 → 2781.44] look,
[2781.62 → 2781.88] your,
[2782.32 → 2783.34] you know,
[2783.38 → 2784.48] your eyes are so beautiful.
[2785.24 → 2785.74] Right?
[2785.80 → 2786.04] Or,
[2786.22 → 2787.30] I love your smile.
[2788.34 → 2789.54] That is God honouring.
[2790.18 → 2791.30] Because in saying that,
[2791.36 → 2791.78] you're saying,
[2791.88 → 2793.16] God made you good.
[2794.00 → 2795.88] God is saying to us,
[2796.68 → 2796.94] you know,
[2796.94 → 2797.86] in this passage,
[2798.08 → 2798.92] our bodies,
[2799.88 → 2800.90] our sexuality,
[2801.32 → 2803.16] it is a gift from me
[2803.16 → 2804.00] and it is good.
[2804.86 → 2805.66] That's the first thing
[2805.66 → 2806.62] the Bible shows us
[2806.62 → 2807.76] that sex is good.
[2808.60 → 2808.80] Now,
[2808.90 → 2809.26] second,
[2809.56 → 2811.84] sex is not only good,
[2811.96 → 2813.92] it's not only a married couple
[2813.92 → 2815.16] coming together physically,
[2815.84 → 2816.96] but Paul tells us
[2816.96 → 2818.96] that sex is also spiritual.
[2819.68 → 2820.80] It's not merely
[2820.80 → 2823.18] a physical bodily appetite,
[2823.72 → 2825.44] it is a spiritual reality.
[2826.26 → 2826.54] You know,
[2826.54 → 2827.50] one of the things
[2827.50 → 2828.56] we often ask,
[2828.60 → 2829.24] and we often think,
[2829.30 → 2830.16] even as Christians,
[2830.34 → 2830.58] is,
[2830.84 → 2832.08] what is so bad
[2832.08 → 2833.04] about sex
[2833.04 → 2833.92] outside of marriage?
[2835.42 → 2836.88] In our day and age,
[2836.92 → 2837.66] we often think
[2837.66 → 2838.62] that the basis
[2838.62 → 2841.14] of sexual ethics
[2841.14 → 2842.74] is harm.
[2843.48 → 2844.48] If something is not
[2844.48 → 2845.72] causing harm,
[2846.02 → 2847.10] it should be fine,
[2847.14 → 2847.36] right?
[2848.48 → 2849.60] And one of the problems
[2849.60 → 2851.18] was that in previous
[2851.18 → 2853.08] generations of Christians,
[2853.22 → 2854.78] like 40 or 50 years ago,
[2855.28 → 2856.00] they said,
[2856.08 → 2856.32] you know,
[2856.32 → 2858.46] the greatest dangers
[2858.46 → 2859.24] of having sex
[2859.24 → 2859.94] outside of marriage
[2859.94 → 2860.56] is two things.
[2860.72 → 2860.98] One,
[2861.34 → 2862.36] you can get sexually
[2862.36 → 2863.36] transmitted diseases,
[2863.78 → 2864.98] that's very bad,
[2865.10 → 2865.52] be careful,
[2865.98 → 2866.44] and two,
[2866.52 → 2867.44] you can have unwanted
[2867.44 → 2868.04] pregnancy.
[2869.32 → 2870.32] So you don't want
[2870.32 → 2870.90] to do that.
[2871.02 → 2871.82] Those two things,
[2871.86 → 2872.86] you want to avoid that.
[2873.62 → 2874.00] Now,
[2874.06 → 2875.08] that is true,
[2875.66 → 2876.62] but those aren't
[2876.62 → 2877.42] the reasons
[2877.42 → 2879.06] why God put boundaries
[2879.06 → 2879.96] around sex.
[2880.56 → 2881.56] And the problem is,
[2881.60 → 2882.08] when you think
[2882.08 → 2883.22] that's the only harm
[2883.22 → 2884.24] that sex outside of marriage
[2884.24 → 2884.72] does,
[2885.04 → 2886.10] the minute that you have
[2886.10 → 2887.34] a technical solution,
[2887.66 → 2888.84] or technological solution,
[2889.22 → 2890.10] like the condom,
[2890.70 → 2891.92] suddenly the possibility
[2891.92 → 2892.66] of harm
[2892.66 → 2894.08] is drastically reduced.
[2894.84 → 2895.30] And therefore,
[2895.46 → 2896.64] you're far less likely
[2896.64 → 2897.94] to get a sexually
[2897.94 → 2898.82] transmitted disease,
[2899.00 → 2900.12] and you're far less likely
[2900.12 → 2901.54] to have an unwanted pregnancy.
[2902.22 → 2903.18] So then it becomes,
[2903.34 → 2903.40] well,
[2903.44 → 2904.42] then what's the harm?
[2904.86 → 2905.76] Let's just have sex
[2905.76 → 2906.32] and be married.
[2906.32 → 2909.46] But this is what Paul says
[2909.46 → 2910.28] in verse 16.
[2912.30 → 2912.72] He says,
[2913.06 → 2914.02] Do you not know
[2914.02 → 2915.72] that he who unites himself
[2915.72 → 2916.50] with a prostitute
[2916.50 → 2918.18] is one with her in body?
[2918.86 → 2919.94] For it is said,
[2920.54 → 2921.60] the two will become
[2921.60 → 2922.40] one flesh.
[2923.24 → 2924.50] But whoever is united
[2924.50 → 2925.50] with the Lord
[2925.50 → 2927.12] is one with him
[2927.12 → 2928.08] in spirit.
[2929.68 → 2929.90] Okay,
[2929.94 → 2930.28] and here,
[2930.40 → 2931.24] Paul is quoting
[2931.24 → 2932.58] from Genesis chapter 2,
[2932.80 → 2933.62] which is what we looked
[2933.62 → 2934.26] at last week,
[2934.26 → 2935.62] and he's talking about
[2935.62 → 2937.90] uniting with another person
[2937.90 → 2940.06] in this one flesh union
[2940.06 → 2941.28] that happens in sex.
[2942.52 → 2942.92] And this,
[2943.02 → 2944.44] when it says this word body,
[2944.60 → 2945.26] it's this word
[2945.26 → 2946.48] that doesn't refer only
[2946.48 → 2948.38] to your physical body,
[2948.44 → 2949.60] but it actually refers
[2949.60 → 2951.04] to your whole person,
[2951.40 → 2952.24] body and soul.
[2952.70 → 2953.90] And this word unites,
[2954.10 → 2955.70] it means glued together.
[2956.82 → 2957.88] And it's not just bodies,
[2958.00 → 2958.94] it's this whole person
[2958.94 → 2960.46] of body, mind, and spirit,
[2961.02 → 2961.98] every part of you
[2961.98 → 2962.82] in every way
[2962.82 → 2964.20] coming together.
[2964.26 → 2966.08] You know, friends,
[2966.14 → 2967.06] we so often forget
[2967.06 → 2968.52] that we are created beings
[2968.52 → 2969.88] that we have both
[2969.88 → 2970.86] a physical body
[2970.86 → 2972.54] and a soul.
[2973.20 → 2975.22] We are bodies with souls,
[2975.32 → 2976.42] we're not just bodies.
[2977.24 → 2978.06] And what that means
[2978.06 → 2978.68] is that sex
[2978.68 → 2979.82] is not just physical.
[2980.58 → 2982.18] It is deeply spiritual.
[2982.60 → 2983.24] It is a deeply
[2983.24 → 2984.82] soul-embodying thing.
[2985.96 → 2986.86] When two people
[2986.86 → 2988.12] come together in sex,
[2988.84 → 2989.84] you're coming together
[2989.84 → 2990.80] in a spiritual
[2990.80 → 2992.14] and a sourish way
[2992.14 → 2993.36] that unites you
[2993.36 → 2994.28] to another person.
[2995.16 → 2996.00] And then to do that
[2996.00 → 2996.66] with someone
[2996.66 → 2998.84] outside the context
[2998.84 → 2999.36] of marriage
[2999.36 → 3000.68] is to unite yourself
[3000.68 → 3002.02] in a deep way
[3002.02 → 3004.52] without saying
[3004.52 → 3005.44] everything else
[3005.44 → 3006.20] that sex is meant
[3006.20 → 3006.64] to say,
[3006.72 → 3007.50] which is that
[3007.50 → 3009.24] I am completely for you
[3009.24 → 3010.38] and I completely love you.
[3010.62 → 3011.54] All that I am,
[3011.62 → 3012.44] I give to you.
[3012.44 → 3015.92] In sex,
[3015.98 → 3016.84] you become united
[3016.84 → 3017.86] with another person.
[3018.92 → 3020.72] And then to tear it apart,
[3021.22 → 3023.56] that does cause great harm.
[3025.66 → 3027.18] So Cameron Diaz
[3027.18 → 3028.24] in the movie
[3028.24 → 3029.52] Vanilla Sky,
[3030.74 → 3031.90] the great theologian,
[3032.88 → 3033.60] says this.
[3034.56 → 3034.90] She says,
[3035.00 → 3036.20] don't you realize
[3036.20 → 3037.68] that when you sleep
[3037.68 → 3038.18] with someone,
[3038.32 → 3039.70] your body makes a promise
[3039.70 → 3041.38] even if your mind
[3041.38 → 3042.04] does not?
[3043.44 → 3044.00] Right?
[3044.12 → 3044.48] In sex,
[3044.52 → 3045.20] your body is saying,
[3045.34 → 3046.90] I am totally yours.
[3047.76 → 3049.10] And if that's not happening
[3049.10 → 3049.78] in the context
[3049.78 → 3051.66] of a one flesh marriage union,
[3051.94 → 3053.08] what you're doing
[3053.08 → 3054.78] is you are taking too much
[3054.78 → 3056.44] and you are giving
[3056.44 → 3057.62] too little.
[3058.52 → 3060.96] You're doing the act,
[3061.06 → 3062.26] the outward act,
[3062.74 → 3063.86] but you're not doing
[3063.86 → 3064.98] all that that act
[3064.98 → 3066.40] is meant to symbolize
[3066.40 → 3066.88] and mean.
[3067.12 → 3067.88] Not all that,
[3068.18 → 3069.40] this whole all that I am,
[3069.46 → 3070.10] I give to you,
[3070.14 → 3070.60] part of it.
[3072.44 → 3074.68] But,
[3074.90 → 3077.68] if that promise
[3077.68 → 3078.86] is a reality,
[3079.06 → 3080.92] if in the context of sex
[3080.92 → 3082.00] it is saying
[3082.00 → 3082.60] and expressing
[3082.60 → 3083.56] all that I am,
[3083.62 → 3084.48] I give to you,
[3085.14 → 3086.50] then what it is,
[3086.56 → 3087.30] what sex is,
[3087.34 → 3089.38] it's a regular renewal
[3089.38 → 3090.56] of our wedding vows.
[3090.94 → 3092.68] It's drawing you deeper
[3092.68 → 3094.10] into intimacy
[3094.10 → 3095.04] with one another.
[3095.64 → 3095.92] And friends,
[3096.04 → 3096.72] in this way,
[3096.92 → 3098.14] sex is sacramental.
[3098.14 → 3100.90] It's like the Lord's Supper
[3100.90 → 3102.24] in that it is a physical
[3102.24 → 3103.42] reenactment
[3103.42 → 3104.54] of the oneness
[3104.54 → 3105.62] that we have with God
[3105.62 → 3107.10] and the oneness
[3107.10 → 3107.98] that we have
[3107.98 → 3108.72] with our spouses.
[3109.52 → 3110.98] So it renews
[3110.98 → 3112.16] and it revitalizes
[3112.16 → 3112.88] that commitment
[3112.88 → 3113.68] to one another.
[3113.94 → 3114.92] And it's not about
[3114.92 → 3115.60] getting,
[3116.60 → 3117.68] it's about giving.
[3118.68 → 3119.18] In sex,
[3119.28 → 3120.04] a married couple
[3120.04 → 3121.76] expresses their love
[3121.76 → 3124.48] to make their spouse
[3124.48 → 3125.46] more confident.
[3126.40 → 3127.90] They express their love
[3127.90 → 3129.20] to make their spouse
[3129.20 → 3130.44] more secure,
[3130.78 → 3131.92] to be more known
[3131.92 → 3132.56] and to be able
[3132.56 → 3134.12] to rest in your love
[3134.12 → 3135.28] and to feel more alive.
[3136.66 → 3137.34] Sex is saying
[3137.34 → 3138.16] to your spouse
[3138.16 → 3140.74] what Jesus says to us
[3140.74 → 3141.98] as the church,
[3142.24 → 3143.56] that I will never leave you,
[3144.22 → 3146.42] that I will never reject you,
[3146.86 → 3148.58] that I will never replace you,
[3148.58 → 3150.14] that I love you completely,
[3150.14 → 3151.48] that I am yours
[3151.48 → 3152.36] and you are mine
[3152.36 → 3153.30] and I want you
[3153.30 → 3154.22] and I long for you
[3154.22 → 3155.14] and nothing is going
[3155.14 → 3155.78] to change that
[3155.78 → 3157.24] until death do us part.
[3158.42 → 3160.02] That's what Jesus says
[3160.02 → 3161.00] to us,
[3162.28 → 3163.30] his bride.
[3164.58 → 3165.64] And that's what spouses
[3165.64 → 3167.08] say to each other
[3167.08 → 3167.76] in sex
[3167.76 → 3169.60] as we unite ourselves
[3169.60 → 3170.52] to one another
[3170.52 → 3171.48] in body and soul.
[3171.90 → 3172.02] Right?
[3172.06 → 3172.36] Do you see?
[3172.46 → 3173.22] It's a picture
[3173.22 → 3175.84] of God's love for us.
[3176.40 → 3178.10] And then to take
[3178.10 → 3179.00] that picture
[3179.00 → 3181.38] and to separate
[3181.38 → 3182.24] the act
[3182.24 → 3183.20] from the promise
[3183.20 → 3183.84] it gives
[3183.84 → 3185.26] does damage
[3185.26 → 3186.02] to us,
[3186.16 → 3186.70] Paul says,
[3186.80 → 3187.66] and to the gospel.
[3190.82 → 3192.68] And because sex is good
[3192.68 → 3193.82] and because it is
[3193.82 → 3195.48] spiritual in this way,
[3195.66 → 3196.04] finally,
[3196.38 → 3197.84] it is sacred.
[3198.56 → 3199.16] And that's also
[3199.16 → 3199.52] what we see
[3199.52 → 3200.10] in this passage
[3200.10 → 3200.80] moving on
[3200.80 → 3201.98] in verses 18 to 20.
[3202.64 → 3203.86] So here's what Paul says.
[3204.56 → 3205.02] He says,
[3205.02 → 3206.72] flee from sexual immorality.
[3207.40 → 3208.48] All other sins
[3208.48 → 3209.30] a person commits
[3209.30 → 3210.98] are outside the body,
[3211.08 → 3212.12] but whoever sins sexually
[3212.12 → 3213.36] sins against their own body.
[3213.80 → 3214.42] Do you not know
[3214.42 → 3215.08] that your bodies
[3215.08 → 3215.60] are temples
[3215.60 → 3216.52] of the Holy Spirit
[3216.52 → 3218.92] who is in you,
[3219.42 → 3220.38] whom you have received
[3220.38 → 3220.88] from God?
[3221.60 → 3222.82] You are not your own.
[3223.22 → 3223.74] You were bought
[3223.74 → 3224.38] at a price.
[3224.50 → 3224.70] Therefore,
[3224.86 → 3225.40] honour God
[3225.40 → 3226.04] with your bodies.
[3227.40 → 3228.88] So look what Paul says.
[3230.28 → 3230.76] Flee
[3230.76 → 3232.76] from sexual immorality.
[3232.76 → 3235.06] That's a really strong verb.
[3235.32 → 3236.06] We don't see that much
[3236.06 → 3236.50] in scripture.
[3237.36 → 3237.92] Flee.
[3238.22 → 3239.02] Run away.
[3239.12 → 3239.88] Get as far away
[3239.88 → 3240.70] from it as possible.
[3241.36 → 3241.80] And that word
[3241.80 → 3242.88] sexual immorality
[3242.88 → 3243.64] in Greek
[3243.64 → 3244.94] is cornea.
[3245.78 → 3246.62] It's this
[3246.62 → 3247.98] big umbrella
[3247.98 → 3248.82] word
[3248.82 → 3249.56] that represents
[3249.56 → 3250.82] any departure
[3250.82 → 3252.44] from God's design
[3252.44 → 3253.26] of one man
[3253.26 → 3253.94] and one woman
[3253.94 → 3254.84] in marital union.
[3256.42 → 3257.30] So I heard
[3257.30 → 3257.96] this illustration.
[3258.96 → 3259.72] There's a guy
[3259.72 → 3260.82] who is
[3260.82 → 3261.98] an expert
[3261.98 → 3264.22] in counterfeit currency
[3264.22 → 3265.84] and he works
[3265.84 → 3266.38] for the government
[3266.38 → 3267.08] and so someone
[3267.08 → 3267.80] went up to him
[3267.80 → 3268.32] and said,
[3268.44 → 3268.78] so now,
[3269.44 → 3270.42] let me understand this.
[3270.58 → 3270.70] You know,
[3270.80 → 3271.32] in working
[3271.32 → 3272.56] with counterfeit money,
[3273.16 → 3274.22] you must study
[3274.22 → 3276.20] all the different ways
[3276.20 → 3277.80] people counterfeit money.
[3278.10 → 3278.32] Right?
[3278.36 → 3279.08] You must examine
[3279.08 → 3279.68] what all these
[3279.68 → 3280.54] different counterfeits
[3280.54 → 3281.30] look like
[3281.30 → 3282.12] that are out there.
[3283.58 → 3284.78] And he said,
[3285.48 → 3285.82] no,
[3286.56 → 3287.70] we just study
[3287.70 → 3288.40] one thing,
[3288.40 → 3290.02] which is what
[3290.02 → 3290.68] it's supposed
[3290.68 → 3291.38] to look like.
[3292.00 → 3292.70] And anything
[3292.70 → 3293.50] that is not
[3293.50 → 3294.10] that
[3294.10 → 3295.78] is a counterfeit.
[3296.74 → 3297.34] And friends,
[3297.40 → 3298.42] it's the same way
[3298.42 → 3298.84] here
[3298.84 → 3299.86] with sex.
[3300.50 → 3301.32] When we look
[3301.32 → 3302.12] at this biblical
[3302.12 → 3303.02] vision of sex,
[3303.10 → 3304.16] this beautiful vision,
[3304.84 → 3305.74] anything that is
[3305.74 → 3306.98] not that,
[3307.52 → 3308.60] the Bible says,
[3308.88 → 3310.46] is a counterfeit.
[3310.72 → 3311.28] It's meant
[3311.28 → 3312.08] to look like
[3312.08 → 3312.86] the same thing,
[3313.24 → 3314.12] but it is not
[3314.12 → 3314.82] the same thing.
[3315.06 → 3316.00] And Paul says,
[3316.38 → 3317.40] run away from it.
[3317.40 → 3318.24] It doesn't have
[3318.24 → 3319.00] anything to do
[3319.00 → 3319.28] with it.
[3321.12 → 3321.38] You know,
[3321.50 → 3322.20] but you see,
[3322.34 → 3323.32] all of God's
[3323.32 → 3324.14] knows
[3324.14 → 3325.32] to sex
[3325.32 → 3326.16] outside of marriage,
[3326.24 → 3326.68] and there are
[3326.68 → 3327.52] plenty of them.
[3328.46 → 3329.20] All of his
[3329.20 → 3329.80] knows of sex
[3329.80 → 3330.18] are there
[3330.18 → 3330.94] because God
[3330.94 → 3331.72] is saying
[3331.72 → 3333.16] one huge,
[3333.56 → 3334.50] big yes
[3334.50 → 3335.36] to sex
[3335.36 → 3336.50] within marriage.
[3338.12 → 3338.86] The biblical
[3338.86 → 3339.64] vision of sex
[3339.64 → 3340.20] is not just
[3340.20 → 3341.26] a list of don'tTS.
[3341.70 → 3342.46] It's a story
[3342.46 → 3343.26] of what sex
[3343.26 → 3344.16] is meant to be
[3344.16 → 3344.86] and how God
[3344.86 → 3345.98] wants to protect it
[3345.98 → 3347.52] from becoming
[3347.52 → 3348.92] something cheapened
[3348.92 → 3349.48] and damaged.
[3350.08 → 3350.28] You know,
[3350.32 → 3350.74] I heard about
[3350.74 → 3351.48] this commercial
[3351.48 → 3353.40] where it's a commercial
[3353.40 → 3355.32] for a news app
[3355.32 → 3356.34] that you can
[3356.34 → 3357.86] download on your phone.
[3358.92 → 3359.54] And it'll say
[3359.54 → 3360.64] how great
[3360.64 → 3361.60] this news app is
[3361.60 → 3362.34] and how convenient
[3362.34 → 3362.84] it is.
[3362.90 → 3363.62] It's in your hands
[3363.62 → 3364.24] and you can swipe
[3364.24 → 3365.32] through and kind
[3365.32 → 3366.64] of sort things
[3366.64 → 3367.20] that you're most
[3367.20 → 3368.00] interested in.
[3368.44 → 3369.40] And then in the commercial,
[3369.54 → 3370.16] there's a fly
[3370.16 → 3371.10] buzzing around
[3371.10 → 3372.30] around the guy.
[3373.50 → 3374.12] And, you know,
[3374.20 → 3374.78] he's bothered
[3374.78 → 3375.44] by the fly
[3375.44 → 3376.08] but he's enjoying
[3376.08 → 3376.54] his app
[3376.54 → 3377.08] and the commercial
[3377.08 → 3377.50] says,
[3377.60 → 3377.68] well,
[3377.70 → 3378.64] there's one thing
[3378.64 → 3380.52] that the app
[3380.52 → 3381.26] maybe isn't
[3381.26 → 3382.40] as good at
[3382.40 → 3383.50] compared to
[3383.50 → 3384.28] a regular newspaper.
[3384.70 → 3385.34] And then the guy
[3385.34 → 3386.08] takes his iPad
[3386.08 → 3387.30] and he smashes it
[3387.30 → 3388.82] down onto the fly.
[3389.48 → 3390.24] It kills the fly
[3390.24 → 3390.86] but, of course,
[3390.96 → 3391.14] you know,
[3391.20 → 3392.28] it shatters his iPad.
[3392.40 → 3392.82] It's broken.
[3393.48 → 3394.22] Glasses everywhere.
[3395.56 → 3396.78] And that's what we do
[3396.78 → 3397.72] when we use sex
[3397.72 → 3398.50] in the wrong way.
[3398.50 → 3399.02] Right?
[3399.08 → 3399.84] We end up
[3399.84 → 3401.24] just destroying it.
[3403.14 → 3403.62] So sex,
[3404.34 → 3405.18] God created sex
[3405.18 → 3405.68] to be good.
[3406.74 → 3407.64] He created it
[3407.64 → 3408.42] to be spiritual.
[3408.76 → 3409.38] It is something
[3409.38 → 3410.50] sacred that God
[3410.50 → 3411.30] protects within
[3411.30 → 3411.88] a boundary.
[3413.46 → 3414.66] And all of that
[3414.66 → 3415.16] is great
[3415.16 → 3417.06] except that there's
[3417.06 → 3417.62] something else
[3417.62 → 3418.16] that we need
[3418.16 → 3418.72] to acknowledge
[3418.72 → 3419.76] which is that
[3419.76 → 3420.76] sex is also broken.
[3421.46 → 3422.18] And sex is also
[3422.18 → 3422.86] something that we
[3422.86 → 3423.64] need to be healed.
[3425.06 → 3425.82] We need healing.
[3425.86 → 3426.28] It's an area
[3426.28 → 3426.74] where we need
[3426.74 → 3427.66] healing in our lives.
[3428.50 → 3429.68] So I also want
[3429.68 → 3430.40] to show you
[3430.40 → 3431.34] what Paul says.
[3431.44 → 3432.34] We didn't read this
[3432.34 → 3433.38] or Edgar didn't
[3433.38 → 3433.94] read it for us
[3433.94 → 3435.04] but right before
[3435.04 → 3436.20] in the passage before
[3436.20 → 3437.86] this is what Paul says
[3437.86 → 3438.78] in verses 9 and 10.
[3439.90 → 3440.42] He says,
[3440.54 → 3441.26] Do you not know
[3441.26 → 3442.16] that wrongdoers
[3442.16 → 3442.94] will not inherit
[3442.94 → 3443.88] the kingdom of God?
[3444.56 → 3445.80] Do you not be deceived
[3445.80 → 3447.52] neither the sexually
[3447.52 → 3448.32] immoral
[3448.32 → 3449.60] nor idolaters
[3449.60 → 3451.30] nor adulterers
[3451.30 → 3452.10] nor men
[3452.10 → 3452.64] who have sex
[3452.64 → 3453.12] with men
[3453.12 → 3454.34] nor thieves
[3454.34 → 3455.30] nor the greedy
[3455.30 → 3456.60] nor drunkards
[3456.60 → 3457.48] nor slanderers
[3457.48 → 3458.28] nor swindlers
[3458.28 → 3460.16] basically nobody
[3460.16 → 3461.78] will inherit
[3461.78 → 3463.38] the kingdom of God.
[3464.76 → 3465.64] And what Paul
[3465.64 → 3466.42] is saying here
[3466.42 → 3467.44] is that we have
[3467.44 → 3468.92] all blown it.
[3469.68 → 3470.56] That's a given.
[3471.84 → 3472.42] There is
[3472.42 → 3473.44] no one
[3473.44 → 3474.56] in this room
[3474.56 → 3475.52] above the age
[3475.52 → 3476.16] of 12
[3476.16 → 3477.16] who has not
[3477.16 → 3478.70] blown it
[3478.70 → 3479.26] who has not
[3479.26 → 3480.06] sinned
[3480.06 → 3481.06] in terms of
[3481.06 → 3481.84] our sexuality.
[3482.60 → 3483.80] But the good news
[3483.80 → 3484.42] friends is that
[3484.42 → 3485.06] if you have
[3485.06 → 3485.62] sinned
[3485.62 → 3486.20] sexually
[3486.20 → 3487.36] the gospel
[3487.36 → 3488.84] is for you
[3488.84 → 3489.18] too.
[3490.40 → 3490.64] Right?
[3490.74 → 3491.18] And so Paul
[3491.18 → 3491.84] continues
[3491.84 → 3493.82] in verse 11.
[3494.10 → 3494.54] He says,
[3494.94 → 3495.52] And that is
[3495.52 → 3496.30] what some of you
[3496.30 → 3496.70] were
[3496.70 → 3497.94] but you are
[3497.94 → 3498.50] washed.
[3498.96 → 3499.54] You are
[3499.54 → 3500.16] sanctified.
[3500.36 → 3501.14] You are justified
[3501.14 → 3501.80] in the name
[3501.80 → 3502.42] of the Lord Jesus
[3502.42 → 3502.92] Christ
[3502.92 → 3503.84] and by the
[3503.84 → 3504.48] Spirit of our
[3504.48 → 3504.78] God.
[3505.78 → 3506.22] Right?
[3506.26 → 3507.22] That's the good news.
[3507.78 → 3508.76] Our sexual
[3508.76 → 3509.52] brokenness
[3509.52 → 3510.90] can be healed
[3510.90 → 3512.24] because the
[3512.24 → 3512.74] very thing
[3512.74 → 3513.14] that sex
[3513.14 → 3513.72] is a pointer
[3513.72 → 3514.28] to
[3514.28 → 3515.98] which is
[3515.98 → 3517.08] full disclosure
[3517.08 → 3517.86] and complete
[3517.86 → 3518.44] acceptance
[3518.44 → 3520.06] is what we
[3520.06 → 3520.98] get through
[3520.98 → 3521.56] Jesus Christ
[3521.56 → 3522.08] in the gospel.
[3523.12 → 3523.28] Right?
[3524.46 → 3525.98] Jesus sees you
[3525.98 → 3526.84] completely
[3526.84 → 3527.68] and exactly
[3527.68 → 3528.56] as you are.
[3529.44 → 3530.50] He sees you
[3530.50 → 3531.48] completely naked
[3531.48 → 3532.18] before him.
[3533.02 → 3533.56] Nothing is
[3533.56 → 3534.30] hidden from him.
[3534.88 → 3535.60] There is nothing
[3535.60 → 3536.66] you know
[3536.66 → 3537.66] that you
[3537.66 → 3538.66] he knows
[3538.66 → 3539.42] your thoughts.
[3539.42 → 3540.90] he knows
[3540.90 → 3541.60] your feelings
[3541.60 → 3542.24] he knows
[3542.24 → 3543.00] your weaknesses
[3543.00 → 3543.94] he knows
[3543.94 → 3545.20] your lusts
[3545.20 → 3545.78] he knows
[3545.78 → 3546.24] the things
[3546.24 → 3546.64] that you are
[3546.64 → 3547.34] ashamed of
[3547.34 → 3548.10] he knows
[3548.10 → 3548.50] the things
[3548.50 → 3548.78] that you
[3548.78 → 3549.16] don't want
[3549.16 → 3549.92] anybody else
[3549.92 → 3550.26] to know
[3550.26 → 3550.56] about
[3550.56 → 3551.52] he knows
[3551.52 → 3552.74] all of it
[3552.74 → 3553.90] and he
[3553.90 → 3554.74] still wants
[3554.74 → 3555.06] to be in
[3555.06 → 3555.58] a relationship
[3555.58 → 3556.16] with you.
[3556.92 → 3556.98] Right?
[3557.10 → 3558.24] Jesus offers
[3558.24 → 3559.22] himself to
[3559.22 → 3559.60] you
[3559.60 → 3560.84] completely.
[3561.44 → 3561.90] He's still
[3561.90 → 3562.64] delighting
[3562.64 → 3563.32] over you
[3563.32 → 3563.88] in song.
[3564.74 → 3565.04] Friends,
[3565.14 → 3565.58] that's the
[3565.58 → 3565.94] gospel.
[3566.78 → 3567.88] Full disclosure
[3567.88 → 3568.56] where you say
[3568.56 → 3568.90] Lord,
[3568.90 → 3569.86] I am a
[3569.86 → 3570.50] broken sinner
[3570.50 → 3572.18] in complete
[3572.18 → 3572.88] acceptance
[3572.88 → 3573.48] where Jesus
[3573.48 → 3573.96] says I
[3573.96 → 3574.62] love broken
[3574.62 → 3574.98] sinners.
[3575.88 → 3576.28] And he
[3576.28 → 3576.62] says I
[3576.62 → 3577.20] bought you
[3577.20 → 3577.54] with a
[3577.54 → 3578.02] price.
[3578.90 → 3579.30] Through my
[3579.30 → 3579.84] blood I
[3579.84 → 3580.50] have washed
[3580.50 → 3580.78] you.
[3581.20 → 3581.60] I have
[3581.60 → 3582.04] made you
[3582.04 → 3582.58] holy.
[3582.98 → 3583.26] I have
[3583.26 → 3583.70] made you
[3583.70 → 3584.18] acceptable.
[3584.86 → 3585.28] I have
[3585.28 → 3585.96] covered your
[3585.96 → 3586.42] shame.
[3586.86 → 3587.10] I have
[3587.10 → 3587.84] forgiven your
[3587.84 → 3588.84] guilt and
[3588.84 → 3589.78] you belong
[3589.78 → 3590.26] to me.
[3593.14 → 3593.82] You know
[3593.82 → 3594.44] what we're
[3594.44 → 3595.22] looking for
[3595.22 → 3596.64] insects
[3596.64 → 3597.96] insects is
[3597.96 → 3598.56] often
[3598.56 → 3599.68] God.
[3600.96 → 3601.50] In
[3601.50 → 3601.78] sex,
[3601.88 → 3601.98] we're
[3601.98 → 3602.44] looking for
[3602.44 → 3602.74] God.
[3603.66 → 3604.10] The
[3604.10 → 3604.40] Scottish
[3604.40 → 3605.48] writer Bruce
[3605.48 → 3606.32] Marshall once
[3606.32 → 3606.88] said this,
[3607.20 → 3607.60] the young
[3607.60 → 3608.26] man who
[3608.26 → 3608.86] rings the
[3608.86 → 3609.48] bell of a
[3609.48 → 3610.42] brothel is
[3610.42 → 3611.34] unconsciously
[3611.34 → 3611.80] looking for
[3611.80 → 3612.10] God.
[3613.10 → 3613.62] Right?
[3613.70 → 3614.72] We long
[3614.72 → 3617.24] for this
[3617.24 → 3617.80] intimacy.
[3618.80 → 3619.66] We long
[3619.66 → 3620.70] to be known.
[3621.34 → 3621.98] We long
[3621.98 → 3622.44] to be
[3622.44 → 3623.02] accepted.
[3623.02 → 3624.82] But friends,
[3624.96 → 3625.60] no sexual
[3625.60 → 3626.20] partner is
[3626.20 → 3626.76] ever going
[3626.76 → 3627.26] to be able
[3627.26 → 3627.74] to fulfill
[3627.74 → 3628.32] that duty
[3628.32 → 3628.86] in your
[3628.86 → 3629.18] life.
[3629.72 → 3630.12] That is
[3630.12 → 3630.64] higher than
[3630.64 → 3631.40] anybody's
[3631.40 → 3631.86] pay grade.
[3632.30 → 3632.90] That's only
[3632.90 → 3633.46] something that
[3633.46 → 3633.98] God can
[3633.98 → 3634.26] do.
[3634.76 → 3635.44] To fill
[3635.44 → 3635.80] and to
[3635.80 → 3636.30] validate
[3636.30 → 3636.88] the soul.
[3637.90 → 3638.22] But friends,
[3638.28 → 3638.74] that is what
[3638.74 → 3639.38] Jesus does.
[3640.26 → 3640.84] And when that
[3640.84 → 3641.62] captures your
[3641.62 → 3642.66] heart, and
[3642.66 → 3643.46] when you feel
[3643.46 → 3644.22] yourself loved
[3644.22 → 3644.98] by Jesus in
[3644.98 → 3645.58] that way, and
[3645.58 → 3646.24] you rest in
[3646.24 → 3647.18] his love, and
[3647.18 → 3647.76] it goes deep
[3647.76 → 3649.06] down inside
[3649.06 → 3650.48] of you, that
[3650.48 → 3651.32] is what enables
[3651.32 → 3652.14] you to do the
[3652.14 → 3653.00] hard work,
[3653.02 → 3653.96] of following
[3653.96 → 3655.00] Christ, even
[3655.00 → 3655.46] in your
[3655.46 → 3655.98] sexuality.
[3658.18 → 3658.96] So let's
[3658.96 → 3659.18] pray.
[3663.00 → 3663.80] Father, we
[3663.80 → 3664.48] thank you for
[3664.48 → 3666.10] this good
[3666.10 → 3666.96] gift of
[3666.96 → 3668.36] sex that you
[3668.36 → 3668.70] have given
[3668.70 → 3669.06] us.
[3670.04 → 3670.76] And Lord, you
[3670.76 → 3671.64] have given
[3671.64 → 3672.58] it to us so
[3672.58 → 3673.42] that we could
[3673.42 → 3674.38] know the
[3674.38 → 3676.82] love that you
[3676.82 → 3677.90] have for us.
[3678.36 → 3679.12] And that in
[3679.12 → 3679.94] your eyes,
[3680.10 → 3680.96] through Jesus
[3680.96 → 3681.56] Christ, that we
[3681.56 → 3682.20] are completely
[3682.20 → 3682.86] loved and we
[3682.86 → 3683.48] are completely
[3683.48 → 3683.98] accepted.
[3684.84 → 3685.88] And that as a
[3685.88 → 3686.56] married couple
[3686.56 → 3689.38] experiences sex
[3689.38 → 3690.08] together, we can
[3690.08 → 3690.98] express that to
[3690.98 → 3691.72] one another, and
[3691.72 → 3692.12] that we could
[3692.12 → 3694.20] even then image
[3694.20 → 3696.28] the gospel in
[3696.28 → 3696.98] our marriages
[3696.98 → 3697.62] and in the
[3697.62 → 3697.92] world.
[3699.52 → 3700.06] Lord, would you
[3700.06 → 3700.68] help us?
[3701.86 → 3702.46] This is a
[3702.46 → 3703.14] challenge for all
[3703.14 → 3703.80] of us, married
[3703.80 → 3704.38] and singles
[3704.38 → 3704.82] alike.
[3705.72 → 3706.28] But Lord, would
[3706.28 → 3706.98] you help us?
[3707.90 → 3708.54] And Lord, we
[3708.54 → 3709.20] thank you for your
[3709.20 → 3710.70] grace to us and
[3710.70 → 3711.38] the healing that
[3711.38 → 3712.30] we receive from
[3712.30 → 3713.00] you, even in
[3713.00 → 3713.40] our sexual
[3713.40 → 3713.96] brokenness.
[3714.78 → 3715.26] Lord, we pray
[3715.26 → 3715.74] all these things
[3715.74 → 3716.46] in Jesus' name.
[3716.88 → 3717.10] Amen.
[3721.10 → 3721.70] All right, so
[3721.70 → 3722.48] let's stand and
[3722.48 → 3723.74] let's sing I am
[3723.74 → 3724.30] not my own.
[3724.30 → 3724.44] Amen.
[3724.44 → 3724.78] Amen.
[3724.78 → 3724.88] Amen.

[3727.54 → 3728.44] Amen.
[3728.44 → 3728.48] Amen.
[3728.48 → 3730.64] Amen.
[3730.64 → 3731.28] Amen.
[3731.28 → 3732.36] Amen.
[3732.36 → 3732.46] Amen.
[3732.52 → 3732.96] Amen.
[3732.96 → 3737.46] Amen.
[3737.46 → 3737.48] Amen.
[3737.48 → 3737.74] Amen.
[3737.74 → 3740.18] Amen.
[3740.18 → 3770.16] Your Love
[3770.18 → 3784.50] I dance, even when I struggle to believe, with your precious blood you set me free.
[3784.50 → 3813.50] I am not my own, but below, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3814.50 → 3829.50] You've reserved my life and stashed away the fear that you, not a hair can fall from me unless you will it do.
[3829.50 → 3842.68] Even when I'm lost in desperation, all things work together for salvation.
[3842.68 → 3870.50] I am not my own, but below, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3870.50 → 3885.50] Always by your Holy Spirit you assure me of eternal life that made me willing and ready.
[3885.50 → 3898.94] Even when I can't see my wonder and love, from now on to always in forever.
[3898.94 → 3926.94] I am not my own, but below, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3926.94 → 3955.94] I am not my own, but below, body and soul, in my life and in death, to you, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[3955.94 → 3956.90] I am not my own.
[3969.58 → 3977.16] Let's come together in prayer, especially for some of the things that we've heard about today.

[4019.92 → 4021.66] us for us
[4021.66 → 4024.38] Lord, and we offer you these supplications
[4024.38 → 4025.72] Lord we

[4038.06 → 4039.86] is going forth that your
[4039.86 → 4041.44] gospel is powerful to bring
[4041.44 → 4043.50] renewal in every area
[4043.50 → 4044.14] of life
[4044.14 → 4047.16] Lord we thank you for those whom you have
[4047.16 → 4048.34] called to go
[4048.34 → 4050.04] especially
[4050.04 → 4052.22] and vocationally to bear
[4052.22 → 4054.34] witness to the whole gospel
[4054.34 → 4057.06] around the world Lord we pray for those
[4057.06 → 4058.40] resident global missionaries
[4058.40 → 4059.64] and would you
[4059.64 → 4061.84] supply their needs
[4061.84 → 4063.62] their needs financially
[4063.62 → 4065.70] would you also supply their needs
[4065.70 → 4067.94] for your grace
[4067.94 → 4068.98] and your strength

[4070.88 → 4072.22] step out in faith
[4072.22 → 4072.82] to minister
[4072.82 → 4073.60] in your name
[4073.60 → 4076.68] Lord we also
[4076.68 → 4078.60] want to
[4078.60 → 4079.50] in light of
[4079.50 → 4080.52] of the
[4080.52 → 4082.14] passage we looked at together
[4082.14 → 4083.92] today Lord we want to pray for
[4083.92 → 4085.12] marriage
[4085.12 → 4087.22] Lord we want to lift
[4087.22 → 4088.34] all the
[4088.34 → 4089.08] the married
[4089.08 → 4090.28] couples
[4090.28 → 4091.42] in our church
[4091.42 → 4093.44] those who are married
[4093.44 → 4095.94] of our friends
[4095.94 → 4097.04] and our family members
[4097.04 → 4098.14] who we know and love
[4098.14 → 4100.42] and Lord we
[4100.42 → 4102.54] we need help in our marriages
[4102.54 → 4104.90] it is not easy
[4104.90 → 4106.06] because we are
[4106.06 → 4106.98] broken people
[4106.98 → 4108.66] we are
[4108.66 → 4110.12] not like you
[4110.12 → 4110.68] in your
[4110.68 → 4112.10] self-giving love
[4112.10 → 4112.72] but we are
[4112.72 → 4115.04] as Augustine said
[4115.04 → 4115.40] so
[4115.40 → 4117.04] curved in on ourselves
[4117.04 → 4118.48] we are
[4118.48 → 4119.28] self-focused
[4119.28 → 4120.14] and Lord
[4120.14 → 4121.14] and that causes harm
[4121.14 → 4122.84] Lord would you
[4122.84 → 4124.08] bind up marriages
[4124.08 → 4125.58] would you
[4125.58 → 4126.36] strengthen marriages
[4126.36 → 4126.92] especially Lord
[4126.92 → 4127.66] in our church
[4127.66 → 4129.66] whatever stage of marriage
[4129.66 → 4130.20] we are in
[4130.20 → 4130.86] whether we are
[4130.86 → 4132.00] only being married
[4132.00 → 4132.68] a few years
[4132.68 → 4133.68] or whether we
[4133.68 → 4135.36] are celebrating
[4135.36 → 4135.82] a
