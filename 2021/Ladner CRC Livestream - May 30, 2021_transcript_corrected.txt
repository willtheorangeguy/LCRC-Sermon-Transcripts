[253.30 → 283.28] Thank you.

[324.58 → 328.14] We are pleased to have a guest pastor today.
[329.18 → 337.66] Pastor Todd Stat ham is the BCO campus pastor at the Campus Reformed Okanagan Church in Kelowna.

[360.26 → 366.08] Please register with Dorothy by phone or email to attend.
[366.88 → 371.48] And Kids Life will also be in-person starting at 1030.
[371.48 → 377.08] Today, the offering is for the New Immigrant Support.
[378.22 → 385.18] This ministry provides funds for our two new immigrant families during their first year with us.
[385.18 → 393.04] You can give your offering by dropping it off at the church, mailing it, or giving online.
[393.04 → 401.42] Our call to worship this morning is a responsive litany from Psalm 46.
[402.58 → 404.80] We will all start out together.
[407.20 → 413.12] God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help in distress.
[415.12 → 421.20] Though the earth trembles and mountains slide into the sea, we will not fear.
[421.20 → 434.04] Waters may rise and roar, and mountains shake at their surging, but the Lord of hosts is with us, our stronghold, the God of Israel.
[435.56 → 442.74] Even if nations are in chaos and kingdoms fall, God's voice resounds.
[443.50 → 445.10] The earth melts away.
[446.80 → 448.34] Yahweh is with us.

[461.74 → 469.76] Over all the world, God has stopped wars, breaking bows, splintering spears, burning the shields with fire.
[469.76 → 478.80] Be still and know that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted upon the earth.
[480.42 → 482.80] The Most High is with us.
[483.42 → 486.28] Our stronghold is the God of Israel.
[486.28 → 498.18] God of grace.
[498.18 → 498.22] God of grace.
[498.22 → 499.46] You have made our minds.
[499.46 → 514.26] So help us to know you.
[514.26 → 515.26] You have made our hearts.

[529.20 → 533.32] Fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[533.32 → 536.32] So together we may celebrate your glory.
[536.32 → 541.24] Lord, we ask that you will hear our prayers.
[541.24 → 542.32] Amen.
[542.32 → 557.92] Spirit of the living God, fell afresh on me.
[557.92 → 571.24] Spirit of the living God, fell fresh on me.
[571.24 → 585.24] Melt me, hold me, fill me, use me.

[630.24 → 643.24] Long bone caring, selfless sharing.
[643.24 → 656.24] Spirit of the living God, fill our lives with God.
[656.24 → 669.24] God greets us today with these words from Isaiah 41.
[669.24 → 699.24] 
[699.24 → 712.24] Since we can't meet together right now for our mutual greeting, please think of someone you could call later on and greet them then.
[712.24 → 727.24] We will exalt you, God and King, and bless your holy name.
[727.24 → 737.24] We will exalt you, God and King, and bless your holy name.
[737.24 → 747.24] Day after day we'll sing your praise, forever and forever.
[747.24 → 752.24] One generation will come to the next.
[752.24 → 757.24] Our God is good, and his hand is strong.
[757.24 → 771.24] All the world seems his love on the sand, and all the boys will join with the presence of strong.
[771.24 → 781.24] Great is the Lord in all his ways, his great need to be praised.
[781.24 → 791.24] Were we to search for endless days, his great need to be praised.
[791.24 → 794.24] One generation will come to the next.
[794.24 → 796.24] One generation will come to the next.
[796.24 → 801.24] Our God is good, and his hand is strong.
[801.24 → 814.24] All the world sings his marvellous acts, and all the boys will join with his beautiful song.
[814.24 → 824.24] Three Boy Sc stuffs
[825.24 → 827.24] Such's 될 his action from the guy we see everyone at the next.
[827.24 → 829.24] And the Lord with his sacred absolute, in hisilusir than ever.
[830.24 → 833.24] Minnesota, today we take for three as its miracles, means essayer ness of control from treatments and world of living.
[834.24 → 843.22] sent CI 공
[843.22 → 849.00] One generation will fall to the next
[849.00 → 854.36] Our God is good, and His hand is strong
[854.36 → 859.54] All the world sings His love on our songs
[859.54 → 866.22] And our words will join me in those in a song
[873.22 → 877.92] Following Jesus
[877.92 → 880.48] In Matthew 4 we read
[880.48 → 884.08] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers
[884.08 → 887.90] Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother
[887.90 → 891.12] Casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen
[891.12 → 893.14] And He said to them,
[893.76 → 895.98] Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men
[895.98 → 899.72] Immediately they left their nets and followed Him
[899.72 → 905.26] This serves as a powerful example of what it means to follow Jesus
[905.26 → 907.70] When He calls you to follow Him
[907.70 → 911.20] Nothing matters as much as your relationship with Him
[911.20 → 916.54] For from it, we read in Matthew 6 verse 33
[916.54 → 918.02] Everything else flows
[918.02 → 922.64] So to truly follow Christ is to put Him first in your life
[922.64 → 924.48] And to surrender to His lead
[924.48 → 928.04] As the disciples followed Jesus wherever He went
[928.04 → 929.86] We are to do likewise
[929.86 → 932.76] When you make a commitment to Christ
[932.76 → 936.62] You commit to making His chief aim yours as well
[936.62 → 939.16] And that's to be a fisher of men
[939.16 → 941.28] To point people to God
[941.28 → 944.92] If you love Christ, you will love others too
[944.92 → 947.82] And help them find a relationship with Him
[947.82 → 974.24] Will you call and follow me if I'd like to call your name?
[974.24 → 981.90] Will you go where you don't know and never be the same?
[981.90 → 985.82] Will you let my love be shown?
[985.82 → 989.96] Will you let my name be known?
[989.96 → 997.68] Will you let my light be grown in you and your in me?
[997.68 → 1000.30] Will you let me know, and you will love me and Uh-huh?
[1000.30 → 1003.26] Will you love the you hide?
[1003.26 → 1007.14] If I but call your name?
[1007.14 → 1015.16] Will you quell the fear inside and never be the same?
[1015.16 → 1023.24] Will you use the faith you found to reshape the world around?
[1023.24 → 1031.24] Through my sight and touch and sound in you and your in me.
[1033.24 → 1040.24] Lord, your song has echoes true in you, but call my name.
[1041.34 → 1048.24] Let me turn and follow you and never be the same.
[1048.24 → 1056.44] In your company I'll go, where your love and footsteps show.
[1056.94 → 1064.42] Thus I'll move and live and grow in you and your in me.
[1078.24 → 1086.94] Amen.
[1086.94 → 1113.16] For our time of confession and assurance, let us confess our sin before God and one another with this prayer of confession based on Psalm 51.
[1113.16 → 1143.16] 
[1143.16 → 1148.46] Our God. Have mercy on us, O God, in your loving kindness.
[1148.46 → 1153.16] In your great compassion, cleanse us from sin.
[1153.16 → 1161.16] Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.
[1161.16 → 1167.16] Do not cast us from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from us.
[1167.16 → 1177.16] Restore to us the joy of your salvation and sustain us with your bountiful spirit through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1177.16 → 1178.16] Amen.
[1178.16 → 1187.16] God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of our sin is from Psalm 103.
[1187.16 → 1200.16] The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[1200.16 → 1208.16] As a father has compassion for his children, so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him.
[1208.16 → 1212.16] For he knows how we were made.
[1212.16 → 1215.16] He remembers that we are dust.
[1215.16 → 1225.16] But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting for those who fear him.
[1225.16 → 1234.16] And his righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.
[1234.16 → 1245.16] For everyone among us who teeth among divisions, he is worshipping in whole country to domain- facilitators of his disciples,
[1245.16 → 1250.16] The accepted spirit to live bond againstitage camps outside and uni's ancestors and Report class.
[1250.16 → 1257.16] For every covenant was Levant and complete, and of the leadership of his anti-determinidites.
[1257.16 → 1284.16] piano plays softly
[1284.16 → 1288.64] There's a whiteness in God's mercy
[1288.64 → 1293.16] Like the whiteness of the sea
[1293.16 → 1298.20] There's a whiteness in God's justice
[1298.20 → 1301.84] Which is more than liberty
[1301.84 → 1307.84] There is no place where her sorrows
[1307.84 → 1312.48] All are felt and up in hell
[1312.48 → 1317.72] There is no place where her spirits
[1317.72 → 1322.56] Have such kindly judgment given
[1322.56 → 1334.44] For the love of God is broader
[1334.44 → 1339.68] Than the measures of the mind
[1339.68 → 1344.52] And the heart of the eternal
[1344.52 → 1349.52] His most wonderfully guide
[1349.52 → 1354.76] Make our love, O God, more faithful
[1354.76 → 1359.60] Let us take you out to word
[1359.60 → 1364.56] And our lives will be thanksgiving
[1364.56 → 1369.80] For the goodness of the Lord
[1369.80 → 1379.04] And our lives will be Thanksgiving
[1379.04 → 1382.88] Hey, morning kids
[1382.88 → 1384.88] How many of you have pets?
[1384.88 → 1386.04] Have you a dog or a cat?
[1386.04 → 1387.88] Maybe a fish at home?
[1387.88 → 1389.64] My wife has four horses
[1389.64 → 1391.52] Just giving them some hay
[1391.52 → 1395.52] Do you think we have anything to learn from animals?
[1395.52 → 1397.48] What do you think?
[1397.48 → 1400.86] Does God have anything to teach us through our pets?
[1400.86 → 1402.96] I think it's a great question
[1402.96 → 1404.24] I've thought about it quite a bit
[1404.24 → 1407.70] One thing Jesus says when he's teaching his followers
[1407.70 → 1410.20] Not to have anxiety, not to worry
[1410.20 → 1412.76] Is he says, think about the surrounding birds
[1412.76 → 1414.90] And how your Heavenly Father takes care of them
[1414.90 → 1418.30] And I think by doing that he's showing us
[1418.30 → 1420.18] That we actually have something to learn from animals
[1420.18 → 1421.90] By carefully watching them
[1421.90 → 1423.70] We can learn something about God
[1423.70 → 1425.14] And about ourselves
[1425.14 → 1427.78] So, what can we learn from animals?
[1427.78 → 1428.98] What can we learn from our pets?
[1429.82 → 1431.04] Now, here's one thing I've learned
[1431.04 → 1433.28] See this horse eating behind me?
[1433.88 → 1435.00] He's a great listener
[1435.00 → 1437.32] Looks like he's busy eating
[1437.32 → 1440.02] But this whole time he's actually listening to me
[1440.02 → 1442.52] Horses are amazing listeners
[1442.52 → 1443.96] That's something they do so well
[1443.96 → 1445.20] They're constantly listening
[1445.20 → 1447.08] Even when they're doing other things
[1447.08 → 1448.10] And I've often thought
[1448.10 → 1449.64] I wish I could be like that with God
[1449.64 → 1450.54] And with others
[1450.54 → 1451.94] Just listening better
[1451.94 → 1453.24] What about you?
[1457.18 → 1458.64] See, in the Bible God says
[1458.64 → 1460.46] The most important thing
[1460.46 → 1463.84] Is to love God
[1463.84 → 1465.48] With our heart
[1465.48 → 1466.44] And our soul
[1466.44 → 1467.28] And all our strength
[1467.28 → 1469.74] And we do that
[1469.74 → 1470.88] I think first
[1470.88 → 1472.58] By listening to God's Word
[1472.58 → 1475.00] And then God says
[1475.00 → 1476.52] The second most important thing
[1476.52 → 1478.06] Is to love our neighbour
[1478.06 → 1479.38] Those people around us
[1479.38 → 1481.80] And I think we show them our love
[1481.80 → 1482.64] First
[1482.64 → 1484.22] By listening to them
[1484.22 → 1486.66] Something I've learned from animals anyway
[1486.66 → 1488.62] Maybe during the rest of the service
[1488.62 → 1489.54] You can think a little bit
[1489.54 → 1490.82] As you look at your pet
[1490.82 → 1492.70] What is God teaching me
[1492.70 → 1493.58] Through my pet?
[1493.58 → 1501.72] Our scripture reading this morning
[1501.72 → 1503.14] Comes from the 8th chapter
[1503.14 → 1504.32] Of the book of Acts
[1504.32 → 1506.74] I'm reading from verses 26 to 40
[1506.74 → 1508.54] This is the story of Philip
[1508.54 → 1510.70] And the Ethiopian eunuch
[1510.70 → 1512.12] Hear God's Word
[1512.12 → 1514.48] Then an angel of the Lord
[1514.48 → 1515.14] Said to Philip
[1515.14 → 1516.30] Get up
[1516.30 → 1517.88] And go toward the south
[1517.88 → 1518.54] To the road
[1518.54 → 1519.34] That goes down
[1519.34 → 1520.84] From Jerusalem to Gaza
[1520.84 → 1523.50] This is a wilderness road
[1523.50 → 1526.04] So he got up and went
[1526.04 → 1527.00] Now there was
[1527.00 → 1528.50] An Ethiopian eunuch
[1528.50 → 1529.62] A court official
[1529.62 → 1530.54] Of the Mandate
[1530.54 → 1532.02] Queen of the Ethiopians
[1532.02 → 1534.18] In charge of her entire treasury
[1534.18 → 1536.06] He had come to Jerusalem
[1536.06 → 1536.76] To worship
[1536.76 → 1538.90] And was returning home
[1538.90 → 1541.22] Seated in his chariot
[1541.22 → 1543.40] He was reading the prophet Isaiah
[1543.40 → 1546.06] Then the spirit said to Philip
[1546.06 → 1548.14] Go over to this chariot
[1548.14 → 1549.18] And join it
[1549.18 → 1551.34] So Philip ran up to it
[1551.34 → 1552.54] And heard him reading
[1552.54 → 1553.46] The prophet Isaiah
[1553.46 → 1555.16] He asked
[1555.16 → 1556.46] Do you understand
[1556.46 → 1557.14] What you're reading?
[1558.36 → 1559.34] He replied
[1559.34 → 1560.06] How can I
[1560.06 → 1561.84] Unless someone guides me?
[1562.34 → 1563.60] And he invited Philip
[1563.60 → 1564.38] To get in
[1564.38 → 1566.14] And sit beside him
[1566.14 → 1566.84] Now
[1566.84 → 1568.22] The passage of the scripture
[1568.22 → 1569.44] That he was reading
[1569.44 → 1570.78] Was this
[1570.78 → 1572.56] Like a sheep
[1572.56 → 1574.18] He was led to the slaughter
[1574.18 → 1575.58] And like a lamb
[1575.58 → 1577.42] Silent before his shearer
[1577.42 → 1579.56] So he does not open his mouth
[1579.56 → 1581.38] In his humiliation
[1581.38 → 1583.24] Justice was denied him
[1583.24 → 1585.72] Who can describe his generation?
[1586.48 → 1587.26] For his life
[1587.26 → 1588.88] Is taken away from the earth
[1588.88 → 1591.80] The eunuch asked Philip
[1591.80 → 1592.84] About whom
[1592.84 → 1594.02] May I ask you?
[1594.02 → 1596.06] Does this prophet say this?
[1596.38 → 1597.02] About himself?
[1597.02 → 1599.20] Or about someone else?
[1600.58 → 1601.96] Then Philip began to speak
[1601.96 → 1604.36] And starting with this scripture
[1604.36 → 1605.54] He proclaimed to him
[1605.54 → 1607.36] The good news about Jesus
[1607.36 → 1609.80] As they were going along the road
[1609.80 → 1610.74] They came to water
[1610.74 → 1612.14] And the eunuch said
[1612.14 → 1613.24] Look, here's water
[1613.24 → 1614.50] What is to prevent me
[1614.50 → 1615.34] From being baptized?
[1616.16 → 1617.98] He commanded the chariot to stop
[1617.98 → 1619.04] And both of them
[1619.04 → 1619.96] Philip and the eunuch
[1619.96 → 1621.56] Went down into the water
[1621.56 → 1623.76] And Philip baptized him
[1623.76 → 1626.16] When they came up
[1626.16 → 1626.96] Out of the water
[1626.96 → 1628.02] The spirit of the Lord
[1628.02 → 1629.58] Snatched Philip away
[1629.58 → 1631.08] The eunuch saw him no more
[1631.08 → 1633.10] And he went on his way
[1633.10 → 1634.34] Rejoicing
[1634.34 → 1636.54] But Philip found himself
[1636.54 → 1637.98] At Lotus
[1637.98 → 1639.76] And as he was passing
[1639.76 → 1640.54] Through the region
[1640.54 → 1642.32] He proclaimed the good news
[1642.32 → 1643.72] To all the towns
[1643.72 → 1645.74] Until he came to Caesarea
[1645.74 → 1647.40] Amen
[1647.40 → 1648.76] And may God add
[1648.76 → 1649.38] His blessing
[1649.38 → 1650.14] To the reading
[1650.14 → 1651.66] And to the proclamation
[1651.66 → 1652.52] Of his word
[1652.52 → 1654.68] It's a pleasure for me
[1654.68 → 1656.02] To join with you today
[1656.02 → 1656.94] For online worship
[1656.94 → 1657.96] Thank you for having me
[1657.96 → 1659.52] It gives me a chance
[1659.52 → 1660.52] To thank you
[1660.52 → 1661.14] In person
[1661.14 → 1662.16] Well, not in person
[1662.16 → 1663.24] But over the screen
[1663.24 → 1664.28] For your support
[1664.28 → 1665.58] Of the Christian Reformed
[1665.58 → 1666.44] Campus Ministry
[1666.44 → 1667.56] At UBC Okanagan
[1667.56 → 1669.18] If you don't know
[1669.18 → 1669.60] Who I am
[1669.60 → 1670.62] My name is Todd Stat ham
[1670.62 → 1671.66] And I'm a missionary
[1671.66 → 1673.46] Of the Christian Reformed Church
[1673.46 → 1674.24] Of your church
[1674.24 → 1674.72] In fact
[1674.72 → 1675.24] Working
[1675.24 → 1677.12] On the campus
[1677.12 → 1677.78] At UBC
[1677.78 → 1680.04] In Kelowna
[1680.04 → 1682.96] And today I'm here
[1682.96 → 1684.94] To bring God's word
[1684.94 → 1686.02] To share a message
[1686.02 → 1688.52] And I thought I would
[1688.52 → 1689.06] Preach from one
[1689.06 → 1690.04] Of my favourite stories
[1690.04 → 1691.18] This is one of my
[1691.18 → 1692.66] All-time favourite stories
[1692.66 → 1693.16] In the Bible
[1693.16 → 1694.78] From the book of Acts
[1694.78 → 1695.26] Chapter 8
[1695.26 → 1696.18] Do you know the story?
[1696.60 → 1697.70] Have you heard it before?
[1698.32 → 1699.72] It shows the early church
[1699.72 → 1701.02] After the spirit
[1701.02 → 1702.72] Is poured out at Pentecost
[1702.72 → 1704.00] Reaching out to people
[1704.00 → 1705.60] Of different races
[1705.60 → 1706.36] And places
[1706.36 → 1707.44] With the good news
[1707.44 → 1708.02] Of Jesus
[1708.02 → 1709.14] It's like the gospel
[1709.14 → 1711.16] Is radiating
[1711.16 → 1712.36] From an epicentre
[1712.36 → 1713.48] In Jerusalem
[1713.48 → 1715.06] To new countries
[1715.06 → 1716.14] And new peoples
[1716.14 → 1717.22] The church is sharing
[1717.22 → 1717.96] Its faith
[1717.96 → 1720.16] In the marvellous thing
[1720.16 → 1721.54] That God has done
[1721.54 → 1723.44] In Jesus Christ
[1723.44 → 1725.58] In today's story
[1725.58 → 1726.90] We have the very first
[1726.90 → 1728.50] Black African
[1728.50 → 1729.82] Becoming a follower
[1729.82 → 1730.38] Of Jesus
[1730.38 → 1732.64] He's a powerful bureaucrat
[1732.64 → 1733.64] A diplomat
[1733.64 → 1734.50] We could call him
[1734.50 → 1735.44] From the land
[1735.44 → 1737.64] Called Ethiopia
[1737.64 → 1739.16] In Bible times
[1739.16 → 1740.06] Or Kush
[1740.06 → 1740.80] Nubian
[1740.80 → 1741.72] By the way
[1741.72 → 1743.18] The modern country
[1743.18 → 1743.86] Of Ethiopia
[1743.86 → 1744.82] Takes its name
[1744.82 → 1745.72] From this fellow
[1745.72 → 1747.42] Not the other way around
[1747.42 → 1748.44] He was from
[1748.44 → 1749.76] What is present day
[1749.76 → 1750.52] South Sudan
[1750.52 → 1751.36] As you can see
[1751.36 → 1752.02] From this map
[1752.02 → 1752.60] On your screen
[1752.60 → 1753.90] In any case
[1753.90 → 1754.88] This powerful man
[1754.88 → 1756.02] Who serves at the court
[1756.02 → 1758.06] Of the mighty Nubian queen
[1758.06 → 1758.88] The Mandate
[1758.88 → 1759.88] Sometimes called
[1759.88 → 1760.60] The Bands
[1760.60 → 1761.82] He hears
[1761.82 → 1763.60] For the very first time
[1763.60 → 1765.14] That God's son
[1765.14 → 1765.76] Jesus
[1765.76 → 1767.12] Was crucified
[1767.12 → 1768.14] And resurrected
[1768.14 → 1769.56] Not just for Israel
[1769.56 → 1770.82] But for all people
[1770.82 → 1772.88] Including Africans
[1772.88 → 1773.46] Like him
[1773.46 → 1775.04] Or someone
[1775.04 → 1776.06] Of European descent
[1776.06 → 1776.68] Like me
[1776.68 → 1778.40] He's then baptized
[1778.40 → 1780.04] As a follower
[1780.04 → 1780.92] Of Jesus
[1780.92 → 1782.54] It's just a great story
[1782.54 → 1783.60] To remind us
[1783.60 → 1784.26] That the church
[1784.26 → 1785.08] Has a mission
[1785.08 → 1786.40] In the power
[1786.40 → 1787.16] Of the spirit
[1787.16 → 1789.30] To share the good news
[1789.30 → 1790.46] Of what God has done
[1790.46 → 1792.42] In Jesus
[1792.42 → 1793.62] For the salvation
[1793.62 → 1794.66] Of the world
[1794.66 → 1798.92] We are Christ's ambassadors
[1798.92 → 1801.02] Says the apostle Paul
[1801.02 → 1802.68] As though God
[1802.68 → 1804.14] Were making his appeal
[1804.14 → 1805.96] Through us
[1805.96 → 1808.42] See when we gather
[1808.42 → 1809.58] To worship as a church
[1809.58 → 1810.86] We are proclaiming
[1810.86 → 1811.50] The good news
[1811.50 → 1812.88] When we as the church
[1812.88 → 1813.98] Go out into the world
[1813.98 → 1815.84] And we work for the good
[1815.84 → 1816.64] The true
[1816.64 → 1817.26] The beautiful
[1817.26 → 1818.92] Whether it's at school
[1818.92 → 1820.06] Or in our job place
[1820.06 → 1820.58] Or at home
[1820.58 → 1823.12] We are Christ's ambassadors
[1823.12 → 1823.78] And of course
[1823.78 → 1825.52] When we share our faith
[1825.52 → 1826.28] With family
[1826.28 → 1827.00] Or friends
[1827.00 → 1827.94] A word of truth
[1827.94 → 1828.92] Of justice
[1828.92 → 1829.56] Of grace
[1829.56 → 1832.18] God is making his appeal
[1832.18 → 1834.34] To his broken world
[1834.34 → 1834.64] Through us
[1834.64 → 1837.28] So it's essential
[1837.28 → 1838.34] That we share
[1838.34 → 1839.24] Our faith
[1839.24 → 1840.90] God's kingdom
[1840.90 → 1842.60] Is revealed on earth
[1842.60 → 1844.38] As we share our faith
[1844.38 → 1844.96] With others
[1844.96 → 1846.10] Now
[1846.10 → 1846.56] Whoa
[1846.56 → 1848.28] Don't turn off
[1848.28 → 1848.80] The screen
[1848.80 → 1850.64] Just because I said
[1850.64 → 1851.06] Something
[1851.06 → 1852.94] About sharing faith
[1852.94 → 1854.62] I know reformed folks
[1854.62 → 1855.18] Like us
[1855.18 → 1855.78] We're not always
[1855.78 → 1857.26] Comfortable with the idea
[1857.26 → 1858.82] Of talking to other people
[1858.82 → 1859.94] About faith
[1859.94 → 1860.62] And I know some of you
[1860.62 → 1861.42] Are thinking right now
[1861.42 → 1861.96] Oh come on
[1861.96 → 1863.26] I'm not that kind of person
[1863.26 → 1865.00] I don't have the right answers
[1865.00 → 1866.08] I feel uncomfortable
[1866.08 → 1867.66] When I have to talk about my faith
[1867.66 → 1868.06] With others
[1868.06 → 1869.92] I hear you
[1869.92 → 1871.16] I feel you
[1871.16 → 1872.84] But I want to share with you
[1872.84 → 1873.88] A couple of things
[1873.88 → 1874.74] Simple things
[1874.74 → 1876.20] I've learned from this story
[1876.20 → 1876.76] And Acts
[1876.76 → 1879.14] About how to have conversations
[1879.14 → 1880.02] About faith
[1880.02 → 1882.14] With our friends and family
[1882.14 → 1884.64] Because as a
[1884.64 → 1886.62] You know as a campus pastor
[1886.62 → 1887.90] About
[1887.90 → 1890.14] 60% of my work
[1890.14 → 1891.92] Is having conversations
[1891.92 → 1892.76] About faith
[1892.76 → 1894.02] With students and staff
[1894.02 → 1895.06] Some of whom are lost
[1895.06 → 1896.88] Some of whom are found
[1896.88 → 1898.66] Some of them are running from God
[1898.66 → 1900.36] Some are running to God
[1900.36 → 1902.16] Here's the thing
[1902.16 → 1905.12] I'm an off the chart introvert
[1905.12 → 1907.06] So sharing my faith
[1907.06 → 1908.42] Doesn't come easy
[1908.42 → 1909.58] In fact my wife would say
[1909.58 → 1911.32] Talking doesn't come easy to me
[1911.32 → 1913.30] But I've learned a few things
[1913.30 → 1914.24] About sharing
[1914.24 → 1915.84] The good news of Jesus
[1915.84 → 1916.48] With others
[1916.48 → 1917.42] And I want to
[1917.42 → 1918.58] I want to share them with you
[1918.58 → 1920.14] You know the very
[1920.14 → 1921.16] The very first thing
[1921.16 → 1922.72] I've learned about sharing
[1922.72 → 1923.74] Faith with others
[1923.74 → 1925.10] Is that it definitely
[1925.10 → 1927.24] Takes us out of our comfort zone
[1927.24 → 1928.70] But I think it's okay
[1928.70 → 1929.52] To admit this
[1929.52 → 1931.26] Like let's not pretend otherwise
[1931.26 → 1933.40] Did you notice
[1933.40 → 1934.98] Where this story takes place?
[1935.54 → 1936.66] Very first verse
[1936.66 → 1937.32] 26
[1937.32 → 1939.24] Now an angel of the Lord
[1939.24 → 1939.98] Said to Philip
[1939.98 → 1940.96] Rise
[1940.96 → 1942.74] Go toward the south
[1942.74 → 1943.42] To the road
[1943.42 → 1944.26] That run-downs
[1944.26 → 1945.70] That goes down
[1945.70 → 1946.46] From Jerusalem
[1946.46 → 1947.66] To Gaza
[1947.66 → 1949.24] This is a desert place
[1949.24 → 1950.90] Or this is a wilderness road
[1950.90 → 1954.30] Philip is called by God
[1954.30 → 1955.80] To go out of the cities
[1955.80 → 1957.16] Where he had been working
[1957.16 → 1958.60] To go to the desert
[1958.60 → 1959.80] Which in the Bible
[1959.80 → 1961.96] Is a place nobody ever wants to be
[1961.96 → 1964.22] And it's the middle of the day
[1964.22 → 1965.78] You know this phrase
[1965.78 → 1966.98] Go toward the south
[1966.98 → 1969.28] Also could mean
[1969.28 → 1970.36] Go at noon
[1970.36 → 1971.32] And some of your Bibles
[1971.32 → 1972.46] Might translate it that way
[1972.46 → 1973.36] Because back then
[1973.36 → 1973.76] People
[1973.76 → 1974.80] People
[1974.80 → 1976.66] Use the sun and the sky
[1976.66 → 1978.08] To tell time
[1978.08 → 1979.20] And give direction
[1979.20 → 1979.94] So
[1979.94 → 1981.20] Go at noon
[1981.20 → 1982.40] Into the desert
[1982.40 → 1984.34] What do you know about
[1984.34 → 1985.18] The Middle East
[1985.18 → 1986.04] At noon
[1986.04 → 1987.30] In the desert
[1987.30 → 1988.64] Right
[1988.64 → 1989.48] It's hot
[1989.48 → 1990.68] You don't want to be there
[1990.68 → 1992.20] People avoid travelling
[1992.20 → 1993.70] When the sun is at its peak
[1993.70 → 1994.60] In the desert
[1994.60 → 1996.16] So the point is that
[1996.16 → 1997.22] Philip is being called
[1997.22 → 1998.44] Out of his comfort zone
[1998.44 → 2000.24] To share his faith
[2000.24 → 2001.48] The spirit of God
[2001.48 → 2003.22] Moves his church
[2003.22 → 2005.32] Out of our comfort zone
[2005.32 → 2006.90] To share the good news
[2006.90 → 2007.92] So I actually find that
[2007.92 → 2008.92] This makes me
[2008.92 → 2011.14] As a kind of super introvert
[2011.14 → 2012.64] It makes me feel better
[2012.64 → 2013.56] Just to say it
[2013.56 → 2015.12] Yeah it's a little uncomfortable
[2015.12 → 2017.10] When I share my faith
[2017.10 → 2017.50] With someone
[2017.50 → 2018.42] When I'm talking about
[2018.42 → 2019.32] My faith in Jesus
[2019.32 → 2020.22] With someone else
[2020.22 → 2022.26] It makes me a little uncomfortable
[2022.26 → 2023.58] But that's okay
[2023.58 → 2027.40] Now here's my second point
[2027.40 → 2028.42] The second thing I've learned
[2028.42 → 2030.72] It's God
[2030.72 → 2032.18] Who calls us
[2032.18 → 2033.30] To share our faith
[2033.30 → 2034.06] With others
[2034.06 → 2035.98] He's at work here
[2035.98 → 2038.08] These conversations
[2038.08 → 2039.42] Where we have an opportunity
[2039.42 → 2040.72] To speak about Jesus
[2040.72 → 2041.30] With others
[2041.30 → 2042.52] They don't just
[2042.52 → 2043.64] Happen
[2043.64 → 2045.44] God is before
[2045.44 → 2046.42] The conversation
[2046.42 → 2047.90] He's there
[2047.90 → 2049.10] During the conversation
[2049.10 → 2050.46] And he's responsible
[2050.46 → 2052.08] For what happens after
[2052.08 → 2053.72] I find this is a relief
[2053.72 → 2054.48] In fact it gives me
[2054.48 → 2055.16] Some confidence
[2055.16 → 2056.50] Yeah
[2056.50 → 2057.52] Sharing faith
[2057.52 → 2058.08] With friends
[2058.08 → 2058.88] Or co-workers
[2058.88 → 2059.62] Neighbours
[2059.62 → 2060.54] Strangers
[2060.54 → 2062.08] Can push us
[2062.08 → 2063.48] Out of our comfort zone
[2063.48 → 2064.98] But God is in it
[2064.98 → 2066.10] Through
[2066.10 → 2067.24] And through
[2067.24 → 2068.64] And let me show you
[2068.64 → 2069.38] From our story
[2069.38 → 2072.96] Kind of trick question
[2072.96 → 2074.62] In this
[2074.62 → 2076.20] In our story this morning
[2076.20 → 2077.04] Who do you think
[2077.04 → 2078.32] Is the main character
[2078.32 → 2082.32] Now some of you
[2082.32 → 2083.10] Are probably thinking
[2083.10 → 2083.66] Philip
[2083.66 → 2086.22] He does most of the talking
[2086.22 → 2088.22] Some of you are probably thinking
[2088.22 → 2089.40] Oh it's the Ethiopian
[2089.40 → 2089.88] Right
[2089.88 → 2091.42] He's the kind of subject
[2091.42 → 2092.74] Or the object of the story
[2092.74 → 2093.14] In a way
[2093.14 → 2093.40] He's
[2093.40 → 2094.84] And he's in the driver's seat
[2094.84 → 2095.46] Of the chariot
[2095.46 → 2096.08] Right
[2096.08 → 2097.50] Philip gets to ride shotgun
[2097.50 → 2099.54] Well it was a trick question
[2099.54 → 2101.20] They are important characters
[2101.20 → 2101.72] For sure
[2101.72 → 2103.20] But I think the main character
[2103.20 → 2104.04] In this story
[2104.04 → 2105.00] Is God
[2105.00 → 2107.80] See the story begins with him
[2107.80 → 2109.48] Verse 26
[2109.48 → 2111.72] Now an angel of the Lord
[2111.72 → 2113.06] Said to Philip
[2113.06 → 2115.36] Rise and go
[2115.36 → 2117.04] Begins with
[2117.04 → 2118.62] A divine act
[2118.62 → 2120.70] And long before Philip
[2120.70 → 2121.80] Had even shown up
[2121.80 → 2122.38] On the scene
[2122.38 → 2123.36] The spirit had been
[2123.36 → 2124.68] Preparing the eunuch
[2124.68 → 2126.38] To hear the good news
[2126.38 → 2127.38] I mean why else
[2127.38 → 2127.92] Would a man
[2127.92 → 2129.46] From a culture
[2129.46 → 2131.10] Half a continent away
[2131.10 → 2132.80] Be where he was
[2132.80 → 2134.24] At just that time
[2134.24 → 2135.66] Reading the Bible
[2135.66 → 2137.04] He's seeking
[2137.04 → 2138.34] Truth
[2138.34 → 2139.38] God is already
[2139.38 → 2140.34] At work in his heart
[2140.34 → 2141.16] Just as he is
[2141.16 → 2142.30] In conversations
[2142.30 → 2143.16] We might have
[2143.16 → 2144.06] With a co-worker
[2144.06 → 2145.10] A friend
[2145.10 → 2146.04] Or a child
[2146.04 → 2147.04] Who's drifted away
[2147.04 → 2147.72] From faith
[2147.72 → 2149.64] The conversation
[2149.64 → 2150.44] Between Philip
[2150.44 → 2151.48] And the Ethiopian
[2151.48 → 2152.26] Eunuch
[2152.26 → 2152.98] Happens
[2152.98 → 2154.48] Through the spirit
[2154.48 → 2156.20] Verse 29
[2156.20 → 2157.58] The spirit says
[2157.58 → 2158.24] To Philip
[2158.24 → 2159.20] Go over
[2159.20 → 2160.14] And join
[2160.14 → 2161.06] His chariot
[2161.06 → 2162.92] And then the conversation
[2162.92 → 2163.38] They have
[2163.38 → 2164.28] Centres on
[2164.28 → 2164.78] Jesus
[2164.78 → 2166.74] And his word
[2166.74 → 2168.30] And then of course
[2168.30 → 2169.14] The story ends
[2169.14 → 2170.08] With God
[2170.08 → 2171.46] Verse 39
[2171.46 → 2172.98] When they came up
[2172.98 → 2173.54] Out of the water
[2173.54 → 2174.84] The spirit of the Lord
[2174.84 → 2176.98] Carried Philip away
[2176.98 → 2178.28] And the eunuch
[2178.28 → 2179.08] Saw him no more
[2179.08 → 2180.92] But went on his way
[2180.92 → 2181.88] Rejoicing
[2181.88 → 2184.42] God
[2184.42 → 2185.66] God is building
[2185.66 → 2186.28] His church
[2186.28 → 2187.46] And he's bringing
[2187.46 → 2188.16] His kingdom
[2188.16 → 2189.20] As we share
[2189.20 → 2189.72] Our faith
[2189.72 → 2190.30] With others
[2190.30 → 2191.46] This is a sovereign
[2191.46 → 2192.52] Work
[2192.52 → 2193.66] Of God
[2193.66 → 2194.02] And I think
[2194.02 → 2194.68] This gives us
[2194.68 → 2195.86] Confidence
[2195.86 → 2196.92] I mean
[2196.92 → 2197.74] Imagine you run
[2197.74 → 2198.48] Into your friend
[2198.48 → 2199.32] At Costco
[2199.32 → 2200.64] She's not a believer
[2200.64 → 2201.46] And she tells you
[2201.46 → 2201.94] That she's just
[2201.94 → 2202.72] Really struggling
[2202.72 → 2203.80] And you
[2203.80 → 2204.50] Want to say
[2204.50 → 2205.12] Something hopeful
[2205.12 → 2205.50] In fact
[2205.50 → 2206.22] You want to share
[2206.22 → 2207.10] With her
[2207.10 → 2208.22] About how your faith
[2208.22 → 2208.76] In Jesus
[2208.76 → 2209.74] Has helped you
[2209.74 → 2211.88] In some dark times
[2211.88 → 2212.48] Yeah
[2212.48 → 2213.06] You feel
[2213.06 → 2214.22] Kind of awkward
[2214.22 → 2216.22] But God
[2216.22 → 2217.26] Is behind
[2217.26 → 2218.12] This encounter
[2218.12 → 2219.58] And this conversation
[2219.58 → 2221.04] His providence
[2221.04 → 2222.44] Has bumped you
[2222.44 → 2222.84] Together
[2222.84 → 2223.72] At Costco
[2223.72 → 2224.56] Or wherever
[2224.56 → 2225.84] And he's going
[2225.84 → 2226.24] To use
[2226.24 → 2226.84] Whatever comes
[2226.84 → 2227.64] Out of our mouth
[2227.64 → 2229.16] For her good
[2229.16 → 2230.12] Now I don't know
[2230.12 → 2230.66] If I'd be able
[2230.66 → 2231.80] To handle my work
[2231.80 → 2233.64] On a secular campus
[2233.64 → 2234.14] If I wasn't
[2234.14 → 2235.32] Constantly reminding
[2235.32 → 2235.96] Myself
[2235.96 → 2237.44] That like Philip
[2237.44 → 2239.08] The spirit
[2239.08 → 2240.22] Of the ascended
[2240.22 → 2240.74] Christ
[2240.74 → 2241.80] Is before
[2241.80 → 2243.28] Behind
[2243.28 → 2245.04] And in front
[2245.04 → 2246.92] Of every conversation
[2246.92 → 2247.50] I have
[2247.50 → 2248.38] About faith
[2248.38 → 2249.46] As he is
[2249.46 → 2250.16] For you too
[2250.16 → 2251.64] You know
[2251.64 → 2252.44] God prepares
[2252.44 → 2253.26] These encounters
[2253.26 → 2254.16] For us
[2254.16 → 2255.34] And he prepares
[2255.34 → 2256.50] Us for those
[2256.50 → 2257.12] Encounters
[2257.12 → 2258.00] Even if we don't
[2258.00 → 2258.48] Feel it
[2258.48 → 2259.62] Or know it
[2259.62 → 2260.38] Necessarily
[2260.38 → 2263.98] So what else
[2263.98 → 2264.46] Can we learn
[2264.46 → 2264.94] From this
[2264.94 → 2265.88] Encounter
[2265.88 → 2267.00] In Acts
[2267.00 → 2267.80] 8
[2267.80 → 2268.78] Well a lot
[2268.78 → 2270.14] It's a rich story
[2270.14 → 2270.58] But I want to
[2270.58 → 2271.14] Draw your attention
[2271.14 → 2272.02] To just one more
[2272.02 → 2272.36] Thing
[2272.36 → 2273.36] In the interest
[2273.36 → 2273.84] Of time
[2273.84 → 2274.74] Is it just
[2274.74 → 2275.80] Is it just me
[2275.80 → 2276.78] Or is everyone's
[2276.78 → 2277.48] Attention span
[2277.48 → 2278.28] Kind of shrunk
[2278.28 → 2280.20] During online church
[2280.20 → 2281.14] I feel like I've got
[2281.14 → 2281.98] About a 20 minute
[2281.98 → 2282.54] Max
[2282.54 → 2285.32] I'll stick to
[2285.32 → 2286.00] The 20 minutes
[2286.00 → 2286.32] Then
[2286.32 → 2289.02] So the one
[2289.02 → 2289.74] Really important
[2289.74 → 2290.38] Thing I want to
[2290.38 → 2291.48] Share with you
[2291.48 → 2292.28] About sharing
[2292.28 → 2293.00] Our faith
[2293.00 → 2294.28] Is the power
[2294.28 → 2296.04] Of questions
[2296.04 → 2297.40] Questions
[2297.40 → 2298.10] Questions are keys
[2298.10 → 2298.86] To great
[2298.86 → 2300.36] Conversations
[2300.36 → 2301.12] Genuine
[2301.12 → 2301.94] Conversations
[2301.94 → 2302.94] Especially conversation
[2302.94 → 2303.70] In which we share
[2303.70 → 2304.16] Our faith
[2304.16 → 2306.06] Often Christians
[2306.06 → 2306.46] Hesitate
[2306.46 → 2307.54] To share
[2307.54 → 2308.86] Our faith
[2308.86 → 2309.34] In Jesus
[2309.34 → 2310.18] We share
[2310.18 → 2310.80] The good news
[2310.80 → 2311.52] Because we think
[2311.52 → 2311.98] We don't have
[2311.98 → 2312.78] The right answers
[2312.78 → 2314.16] We get kind of
[2314.16 → 2314.62] Spooked
[2314.62 → 2315.62] What if I don't
[2315.62 → 2316.36] Know what to say
[2316.36 → 2317.10] What am I supposed
[2317.10 → 2317.66] To say to this
[2317.66 → 2318.54] Person's problem
[2318.54 → 2320.18] Or how do I answer
[2320.18 → 2321.28] A difficult question
[2321.28 → 2322.20] That they might
[2322.20 → 2322.82] Have for me
[2322.82 → 2324.52] So we don't say
[2324.52 → 2325.28] Anything at all
[2325.28 → 2326.58] You know what
[2326.58 → 2328.26] Good questions
[2328.26 → 2329.58] Are often more
[2329.58 → 2330.14] Important
[2330.14 → 2331.64] In a conversation
[2331.64 → 2332.80] Than having
[2332.80 → 2334.20] The right answer
[2334.20 → 2335.76] Think how often
[2335.76 → 2336.52] Jesus used
[2336.52 → 2337.26] Questions in
[2337.26 → 2338.12] His ministry
[2338.12 → 2340.08] Watch what
[2340.08 → 2340.58] Happens in
[2340.58 → 2341.44] Our story
[2341.44 → 2343.94] First
[2343.94 → 2345.88] Philip listens
[2345.88 → 2347.68] To the Ethiopian
[2347.68 → 2349.36] He doesn't speak
[2349.36 → 2350.50] He listens
[2350.50 → 2351.64] He really listens
[2351.64 → 2352.58] To the Ethiopian
[2352.58 → 2353.94] Who happens to be
[2353.94 → 2354.70] Reading the Bible
[2354.70 → 2355.24] Out loud
[2355.24 → 2355.96] Which is how
[2355.96 → 2357.16] They read in those days
[2357.16 → 2359.74] And only then
[2359.74 → 2360.82] Does Philip preach
[2360.82 → 2361.14] No
[2361.14 → 2362.26] Not even then
[2362.26 → 2363.88] Then he asks
[2363.88 → 2366.36] Do you understand
[2366.36 → 2367.22] What you're reading
[2367.22 → 2368.82] It's a simple question
[2368.82 → 2369.90] You or I
[2369.90 → 2370.68] Could ask a question
[2370.68 → 2371.18] Like that
[2371.18 → 2371.76] To a friend
[2371.76 → 2372.04] Right
[2372.04 → 2375.18] Then the Ethiopian
[2375.18 → 2375.66] Asks
[2375.66 → 2376.84] Philip a question
[2376.84 → 2378.04] How can I
[2378.04 → 2379.16] Look at all these
[2379.16 → 2379.96] Questions going
[2379.96 → 2380.78] Back and forth
[2380.78 → 2382.52] Then Philip jumps
[2382.52 → 2383.48] Into his chariot
[2383.48 → 2383.82] No
[2383.82 → 2385.48] Then the Ethiopian
[2385.48 → 2386.40] Invites
[2386.40 → 2388.64] Philip into his chariot
[2388.64 → 2390.26] Or to sit down
[2390.26 → 2391.18] At the coffee booth
[2391.18 → 2391.54] With him
[2391.54 → 2392.98] Or to go for a beer
[2392.98 → 2393.92] Or to give him
[2393.92 → 2394.90] His cell phone number
[2394.90 → 2395.62] For a call
[2395.62 → 2395.86] Right
[2395.86 → 2396.76] You get the idea
[2396.76 → 2398.26] A relationship
[2398.26 → 2399.36] Is forming
[2399.36 → 2402.62] More questions
[2402.62 → 2404.40] After reading the passage
[2404.40 → 2405.44] Of scripture from
[2405.44 → 2405.76] Isaiah
[2405.76 → 2407.32] The Ethiopian eunuch
[2407.32 → 2408.16] Asks Philip
[2408.16 → 2409.00] To explain it
[2409.00 → 2410.86] And then he asks
[2410.86 → 2412.72] Philip to baptize him
[2412.72 → 2415.48] And these last two questions
[2415.48 → 2416.10] Are important
[2416.10 → 2417.00] Because they show us
[2417.00 → 2418.62] That Philip isn't
[2418.62 → 2419.42] He's not ramming
[2419.42 → 2420.34] His answers
[2420.34 → 2421.86] Down the eunuch's throat
[2421.86 → 2423.42] He's not got an agenda
[2423.42 → 2425.26] He's not pushing
[2425.26 → 2426.28] A tract at him
[2426.28 → 2428.96] Or knocking on his door
[2428.96 → 2429.94] Uninvited
[2429.94 → 2431.30] That was a little bit
[2431.30 → 2431.98] Of a cheap shot
[2431.98 → 2433.62] At Jehovah Witnesses
[2433.62 → 2434.62] Sorry about that
[2434.62 → 2436.36] Philip's listening
[2436.36 → 2437.22] That's my point
[2437.22 → 2438.36] And then he's responding
[2438.36 → 2440.46] By asking questions
[2440.46 → 2441.74] I think this is great
[2441.74 → 2442.68] All these questions
[2442.68 → 2443.60] Back and forth
[2443.60 → 2444.32] Are the marks
[2444.32 → 2446.30] Of a good conversation
[2446.30 → 2447.24] About faith
[2447.24 → 2447.86] And they show us
[2447.86 → 2448.80] A couple of things
[2448.80 → 2449.84] First
[2449.84 → 2451.32] If the person
[2451.32 → 2452.18] With whom we're talking
[2452.18 → 2453.40] Is asking questions
[2453.40 → 2453.94] Of us
[2453.94 → 2455.76] Like the Ethiopian eunuch
[2455.76 → 2456.00] Did
[2456.00 → 2457.46] It shows us
[2457.46 → 2457.96] That the person
[2457.96 → 2458.70] Is interested
[2458.70 → 2459.90] And open
[2459.90 → 2462.16] To us sharing
[2462.16 → 2463.08] Our faith with them
[2463.08 → 2463.96] Then we're not
[2463.96 → 2465.26] We're not intruding
[2465.26 → 2466.44] Into someone's life
[2466.44 → 2467.22] Or we're wasting
[2467.22 → 2467.74] Our time
[2467.74 → 2468.26] With someone
[2468.26 → 2468.98] Who's not ready
[2468.98 → 2469.84] You know the spirit
[2469.84 → 2470.94] Nudges us
[2470.94 → 2472.64] Into a conversation
[2472.64 → 2473.52] Where we can share
[2473.52 → 2474.08] Our faith
[2474.08 → 2475.62] And one of the marks
[2475.62 → 2476.74] Of that nudging
[2476.74 → 2477.62] From the spirit
[2477.62 → 2478.60] Is when questions
[2478.60 → 2480.30] Are being asked
[2480.30 → 2482.42] And second
[2482.42 → 2483.66] Questions are one of the
[2483.66 → 2485.14] Are one of the main ways
[2485.14 → 2486.52] That the spirit
[2486.52 → 2487.56] Changes people
[2487.56 → 2489.88] What I mean is that
[2489.88 → 2491.20] Is that our questions
[2491.20 → 2493.36] In a conversation
[2493.36 → 2494.90] Might be how Jesus
[2494.90 → 2496.04] Himself speaks
[2496.04 → 2498.08] Into a person's life
[2498.08 → 2499.30] A word of comfort
[2499.30 → 2500.74] Or challenge
[2500.74 → 2502.08] A word that might
[2502.08 → 2503.16] Transform
[2503.16 → 2505.40] Simple questions
[2505.40 → 2506.70] As simple as
[2506.70 → 2508.14] How are you
[2508.14 → 2509.38] How are you really
[2509.38 → 2510.18] Doing
[2510.18 → 2513.22] Questions can be
[2513.22 → 2514.26] Powerful things
[2514.26 → 2515.64] In a conversation
[2515.64 → 2516.36] When we're sharing
[2516.36 → 2516.88] Our faith
[2516.88 → 2520.26] And last
[2520.26 → 2520.80] When Philip
[2520.80 → 2521.64] Asks questions
[2521.64 → 2522.54] Shows that he's
[2522.54 → 2523.32] Really interested
[2523.32 → 2524.02] In the eunuch
[2524.02 → 2525.00] As a
[2525.00 → 2526.56] What can we say
[2526.56 → 2527.70] As a unique
[2527.70 → 2528.78] Person
[2528.78 → 2530.50] And this creates
[2530.50 → 2531.56] A real relationship
[2531.56 → 2532.66] With a person
[2532.66 → 2533.22] With whom we can
[2533.22 → 2534.22] Share our faith
[2534.22 → 2536.12] Some Christians
[2536.12 → 2537.02] Were taught
[2537.02 → 2537.94] To share our faith
[2537.94 → 2538.86] With an agenda
[2538.86 → 2539.74] Or like
[2539.74 → 2540.74] With a lead question
[2540.74 → 2541.92] We've already prepared
[2541.92 → 2542.42] Kind of
[2542.42 → 2543.40] Knock
[2543.40 → 2544.04] Hi there
[2544.04 → 2545.38] I wonder
[2545.38 → 2546.42] If you were to die
[2546.42 → 2546.74] Tonight
[2546.74 → 2547.88] Would you go to heaven
[2547.88 → 2549.46] You know
[2549.46 → 2550.46] I'm not comfortable
[2550.46 → 2551.58] With that
[2551.58 → 2552.64] Kind of approach
[2552.64 → 2553.46] Because then
[2553.46 → 2554.16] Our questions
[2554.16 → 2555.68] Our question
[2555.68 → 2556.40] Doesn't connect
[2556.40 → 2556.80] With that
[2556.80 → 2557.60] Person's
[2557.60 → 2558.54] Unique story
[2558.54 → 2559.96] And their needs
[2559.96 → 2560.64] I think it's far
[2560.64 → 2561.44] Better to listen
[2561.44 → 2562.36] Like Philip did
[2562.36 → 2563.14] And let the
[2563.14 → 2564.72] Conversation unfold
[2564.72 → 2566.14] Asking questions
[2566.14 → 2566.92] That are specific
[2566.92 → 2567.76] To the person
[2567.76 → 2568.90] Then a genuine
[2568.90 → 2570.16] Relationship develops
[2570.16 → 2571.26] That's the platform
[2571.26 → 2572.72] By which we
[2572.72 → 2574.40] Create this
[2574.40 → 2575.12] Connection
[2575.12 → 2576.32] To share our faith
[2576.32 → 2577.96] Philip is doing this
[2577.96 → 2578.98] What are you reading
[2578.98 → 2580.94] Do you understand it
[2580.94 → 2582.18] Can I join you
[2582.18 → 2584.96] We believe as
[2584.96 → 2585.88] Christians
[2585.88 → 2586.54] That Jesus
[2586.54 → 2587.66] Is the answer
[2587.66 → 2588.90] He's the answer
[2588.90 → 2589.62] To questions
[2589.62 → 2591.40] That arise
[2591.40 → 2592.34] From unique
[2592.34 → 2593.02] People
[2593.02 → 2593.84] Who are in
[2593.84 → 2595.02] Particular seasons
[2595.02 → 2595.74] And moments
[2595.74 → 2596.32] Of life
[2596.32 → 2597.32] With very different
[2597.32 → 2597.90] Sins
[2597.90 → 2598.90] And fears
[2598.90 → 2600.14] And burdens
[2600.14 → 2600.94] And hurts
[2600.94 → 2602.44] Listen
[2602.44 → 2603.68] To those stories
[2603.68 → 2604.46] And then ask
[2604.46 → 2605.02] Questions
[2605.02 → 2605.44] That show
[2605.44 → 2606.00] Interest
[2606.00 → 2606.64] And care
[2606.64 → 2609.00] Then share
[2609.00 → 2610.32] How Jesus
[2610.32 → 2610.86] Has touched
[2610.86 → 2611.48] Our lives
[2611.48 → 2612.86] With his grace
[2612.86 → 2613.42] And truth
[2613.42 → 2614.14] How we've
[2614.14 → 2615.38] Experienced Jesus
[2615.38 → 2616.18] Just like
[2616.18 → 2616.98] Philip did
[2616.98 → 2618.26] With the eunuch
[2618.26 → 2619.14] When he tells him
[2619.14 → 2620.50] What Isaiah's
[2620.50 → 2622.24] Story about Jesus
[2622.24 → 2623.00] Means for him
[2623.00 → 2624.28] Then Jesus
[2624.28 → 2624.84] Becomes
[2624.84 → 2625.98] The answer
[2625.98 → 2628.06] It's intimidating
[2628.06 → 2629.50] To think
[2629.50 → 2630.02] We have to
[2630.02 → 2630.72] Share our faith
[2630.72 → 2631.34] With others
[2631.34 → 2633.02] When we think
[2633.02 → 2633.54] We have to have
[2633.54 → 2634.32] All the answers
[2634.32 → 2635.36] Who does
[2635.36 → 2636.94] It's not
[2636.94 → 2637.68] Intimidating
[2637.68 → 2638.74] To share our faith
[2638.74 → 2639.62] If it means
[2639.62 → 2640.34] First
[2640.34 → 2641.32] Listening carefully
[2641.32 → 2642.38] And asking
[2642.38 → 2643.10] Questions
[2643.10 → 2644.28] As a relationship
[2644.28 → 2645.04] Emerges
[2645.04 → 2645.54] We can all
[2645.54 → 2646.06] Do that
[2646.06 → 2647.46] And then we
[2647.46 → 2648.10] Share with our
[2648.10 → 2649.34] Friend or our
[2649.34 → 2650.30] Old family member
[2650.30 → 2650.90] How we've
[2650.90 → 2652.22] Experienced Jesus
[2652.22 → 2653.56] And what we think
[2653.56 → 2654.80] The Bible is telling us
[2654.80 → 2656.90] So those are a couple
[2656.90 → 2657.68] Things I've learned
[2657.68 → 2658.74] From this passage
[2658.74 → 2660.14] And I've applied it
[2660.14 → 2660.90] In my own work
[2660.90 → 2662.92] I'll give you one
[2662.92 → 2664.02] Example just in closing
[2664.02 → 2666.38] This last year
[2666.38 → 2667.58] On campus
[2667.58 → 2668.46] I've been organizing
[2668.46 → 2670.82] Interfaith conversations
[2670.82 → 2672.38] For BCO students
[2672.38 → 2673.56] It's been a great
[2673.56 → 2674.28] Experience
[2674.28 → 2675.98] And the goal is
[2675.98 → 2677.08] To share our faith
[2677.08 → 2678.58] It's mostly Muslims
[2678.58 → 2679.14] And Christians
[2679.14 → 2679.80] Taking part
[2679.80 → 2680.78] In the Muslims
[2680.78 → 2682.16] Share their faith
[2682.16 → 2682.64] With us
[2682.64 → 2684.20] Christians share
[2684.20 → 2684.84] Our faith
[2684.84 → 2685.36] With them
[2685.36 → 2686.62] With whoever else
[2686.62 → 2687.24] Shows up
[2687.24 → 2688.86] And questions
[2688.86 → 2689.96] Are always prominent
[2689.96 → 2691.22] Why do you
[2691.22 → 2692.30] Believe this
[2692.30 → 2693.70] Why do you
[2693.70 → 2694.66] Christians do that
[2694.66 → 2695.90] Why do you Muslims
[2695.90 → 2697.18] Think this
[2697.18 → 2700.42] Now a couple of
[2700.42 → 2701.60] Of the students
[2701.60 → 2702.40] Taking part
[2702.40 → 2703.64] Young
[2703.64 → 2704.80] Christian women
[2704.80 → 2706.40] They're very shy
[2706.40 → 2707.78] They don't speak up
[2707.78 → 2708.30] Very much
[2708.30 → 2709.24] During the sessions
[2709.24 → 2710.10] One of them
[2710.10 → 2710.70] Was mentioning
[2710.70 → 2711.62] To me afterwards
[2711.62 → 2712.28] After one of
[2712.28 → 2713.00] Our conversations
[2713.00 → 2714.96] One of the Muslim
[2714.96 → 2715.66] Participants
[2715.66 → 2716.66] Contacted her
[2716.66 → 2717.44] And her friends
[2717.44 → 2718.18] On Facebook
[2718.18 → 2719.74] Because he wanted
[2719.74 → 2720.52] To follow up
[2720.52 → 2721.58] A question
[2721.58 → 2722.48] She had asked
[2722.48 → 2723.60] That had gone
[2723.60 → 2724.44] Unanswered
[2724.44 → 2726.32] So they start
[2726.32 → 2727.74] Talking on social
[2727.74 → 2728.12] Media
[2728.12 → 2729.32] More questions
[2729.32 → 2730.60] Some answers
[2730.60 → 2731.64] But a lot of
[2731.64 → 2732.02] Questions
[2732.02 → 2733.26] These young
[2733.26 → 2734.10] Christian students
[2734.10 → 2734.90] Are the first
[2734.90 → 2735.44] To admit
[2735.44 → 2736.66] They don't know
[2736.66 → 2737.50] As much about
[2737.50 → 2738.06] The Bible
[2738.06 → 2739.20] Or theology
[2739.20 → 2740.16] As they should
[2740.16 → 2740.72] And they're
[2740.72 → 2741.36] Probably right
[2741.36 → 2741.90] I think they
[2741.90 → 2742.52] Would have trouble
[2742.52 → 2743.54] Passing a
[2743.54 → 2743.72] You know
[2743.72 → 2744.42] Christian reform
[2744.42 → 2745.46] Catechism class
[2745.46 → 2746.46] They're not
[2746.46 → 2747.28] They're not
[2747.28 → 2748.26] Super mature
[2748.26 → 2749.60] But they're enthusiastic
[2749.60 → 2750.64] And they're
[2750.64 → 2751.46] Asking questions
[2751.46 → 2753.60] And they're
[2753.60 → 2754.34] Having a genuine
[2754.34 → 2755.22] Conversation
[2755.22 → 2756.04] With this Muslim
[2756.04 → 2756.42] Student
[2756.42 → 2757.00] And a real
[2757.00 → 2757.74] Relationship
[2757.74 → 2758.38] Forms
[2758.38 → 2760.08] And then a
[2760.08 → 2760.76] Big question
[2760.76 → 2761.48] Comes from
[2761.48 → 2761.92] The Muslim
[2761.92 → 2762.42] Student
[2762.42 → 2764.02] Can I
[2764.02 → 2765.00] Come to church
[2765.00 → 2765.46] With you
[2765.46 → 2766.46] He asks them
[2766.46 → 2767.92] I want to hear
[2767.92 → 2768.46] More about
[2768.46 → 2768.92] Jesus
[2768.92 → 2770.30] And so
[2770.30 → 2770.90] For the past
[2770.90 → 2771.48] Few Sundays
[2771.48 → 2772.10] This Muslim
[2772.10 → 2772.76] Student has
[2772.76 → 2773.30] Gone over
[2773.30 → 2774.06] To the apartment
[2774.06 → 2775.04] Of these
[2775.04 → 2775.94] Christian students
[2775.94 → 2777.32] And they
[2777.32 → 2777.94] Watch their
[2777.94 → 2778.52] Online church
[2778.52 → 2779.18] Service together
[2779.18 → 2780.36] Now we
[2780.36 → 2780.60] Didn't
[2780.60 → 2781.08] We didn't
[2781.08 → 2781.78] Start these
[2781.78 → 2782.34] Interfaith
[2782.34 → 2783.08] Conversations
[2783.08 → 2783.86] With a goal
[2783.86 → 2784.68] Or an agenda
[2784.68 → 2785.16] To try to
[2785.16 → 2786.08] Convert people
[2786.08 → 2786.88] We did it
[2786.88 → 2787.46] To create a
[2787.46 → 2788.14] Space so that
[2788.14 → 2788.84] We could share
[2788.84 → 2789.48] Faith
[2789.48 → 2790.60] But like
[2790.60 → 2790.90] I said
[2790.90 → 2791.34] Before
[2791.34 → 2792.44] God is
[2792.44 → 2793.14] Behind all
[2793.14 → 2793.48] This
[2793.48 → 2794.56] He's at
[2794.56 → 2794.96] Work
[2794.96 → 2796.36] No
[2796.36 → 2796.80] My hope
[2796.80 → 2797.24] And prayer
[2797.24 → 2797.54] Is that
[2797.54 → 2797.90] This one
[2797.90 → 2798.20] Muslim
[2798.20 → 2798.56] Student
[2798.56 → 2799.78] Will also
[2799.78 → 2800.68] Go on
[2800.68 → 2801.10] His way
[2801.10 → 2801.76] Rejoicing
[2801.76 → 2803.02] Like the
[2803.02 → 2803.60] Ethiopian
[2803.60 → 2803.92] Eunuch
[2803.92 → 2804.48] Because he's
[2804.48 → 2805.12] Encountered
[2805.12 → 2806.98] Jesus Christ
[2806.98 → 2808.98] So I hope
[2808.98 → 2809.28] You take
[2809.28 → 2809.64] Heart
[2809.64 → 2811.06] And have
[2811.06 → 2811.90] Courage to
[2811.90 → 2812.28] Share the
[2812.28 → 2812.72] Good news
[2812.72 → 2813.16] We don't
[2813.16 → 2813.52] Have all
[2813.52 → 2814.06] The answers
[2814.06 → 2814.80] We don't
[2814.80 → 2815.20] Have to
[2815.20 → 2815.60] Have all
[2815.60 → 2816.30] The answers
[2816.30 → 2817.42] But we
[2817.42 → 2818.24] Love others
[2818.24 → 2818.78] Enough to
[2818.78 → 2819.36] Listen to
[2819.36 → 2820.24] Them and
[2820.24 → 2820.60] To ask
[2820.60 → 2821.40] Questions that
[2821.40 → 2821.90] Touch their
[2821.90 → 2822.68] Lives and
[2822.68 → 2823.04] In doing
[2823.04 → 2823.46] This we
[2823.46 → 2824.22] Point to
[2824.22 → 2824.86] The answer
[2824.86 → 2826.48] Jesus Christ
[2826.48 → 2826.86] And I
[2826.86 → 2828.16] Hope that
[2828.16 → 2828.80] Our reformed
[2828.80 → 2829.22] Churches
[2829.22 → 2829.78] Would become
[2829.78 → 2830.06] More
[2830.06 → 2830.94] Would become
[2830.94 → 2831.56] Better and
[2831.56 → 2832.48] More enthusiastic
[2832.48 → 2833.42] About sharing
[2833.42 → 2834.12] Our faith
[2834.12 → 2834.72] Because in
[2834.72 → 2835.10] All this
[2835.10 → 2836.30] God makes
[2836.30 → 2837.06] His appeal
[2837.06 → 2838.08] Through us
[2838.08 → 2839.28] To his
[2839.28 → 2840.14] Hurting and
[2840.14 → 2841.08] Sinful world
[2841.08 → 2841.88] And then his
[2841.88 → 2842.86] Son is glorified
[2842.86 → 2844.06] And his
[2844.06 → 2845.34] Kingdom is
[2845.34 → 2845.94] Revealed
[2845.94 → 2847.16] Amen
[2865.10 → 2878.32] I love to tell
[2878.32 → 2882.76] The story of unseen
[2882.76 → 2885.36] Things above
[2885.36 → 2889.90] Of Jesus and his glory
[2889.90 → 2895.48] Of Jesus and his love
[2895.48 → 2899.88] I love to tell the story
[2899.88 → 2905.14] Because I know it's true
[2905.14 → 2910.66] It satisfies my longings
[2910.66 → 2915.60] As nothing else can do
[2915.60 → 2920.58] I love to tell the story
[2920.58 → 2920.76] I love to tell the story
[2920.76 → 2925.80] It will be my theme in glory
[2925.80 → 2930.92] To tell the old story
[2930.92 → 2936.92] Of Jesus and his love
[2936.92 → 2943.90] I love to tell the story
[2943.90 → 2944.90] I love to tell the story
[2944.90 → 2950.08] This pleasant to repeat
[2950.08 → 2955.24] What sins each time I tell it
[2955.24 → 2960.66] Are wonderfully sweet
[2960.66 → 2965.64] I love to tell the story
[2965.64 → 2970.64] For some have never made
[2970.64 → 2975.64] The message of salvation
[2975.64 → 2981.06] From God to holy
[2981.06 → 2983.72] I love to tell the story
[2983.72 → 2986.68] I love to tell the story
[2986.68 → 2991.74] It will be my theme in glory
[2991.74 → 2997.44] To tell the old, old story
[2997.44 → 3003.42] Of Jesus and his love
[3003.42 → 3011.48] I love to tell the story
[3011.48 → 3016.82] For those who know it best
[3016.82 → 3021.26] Seem holy and thirsty
[3021.26 → 3026.44] To hear it like the rest
[3026.44 → 3032.04] And when it sings of glory
[3032.04 → 3037.42] I sing the new hymn star
[3037.42 → 3042.42] It will be the old, old story
[3042.42 → 3048.42] That I have loved so long
[3048.42 → 3053.36] I love to tell the story
[3053.36 → 3058.46] Dwell in our theme in glory
[3058.46 → 3063.96] To tell the old, old story
[3063.96 → 3069.96] Of Jesus and his love
[3069.96 → 3092.62] Shall we pray?
[3092.62 → 3097.20] Lord, our Lord
[3097.20 → 3098.66] Thy glorious name
[3098.66 → 3101.52] All thy wondrous works proclaim
[3101.52 → 3104.54] Thine the name of matchless worth
[3104.54 → 3106.42] Excellent in all the earth
[3106.42 → 3108.56] How great your name
[3108.56 → 3112.18] Creator and sustainer of the universe
[3112.18 → 3113.94] And our Father
[3113.94 → 3116.74] Thank you for inviting us to come
[3116.74 → 3117.68] And worship you
[3117.68 → 3119.42] The King of kings
[3119.42 → 3120.56] And Lord of lords
[3120.56 → 3125.14] We pray for open minds and hearts
[3125.14 → 3126.28] And open hands
[3126.28 → 3127.62] To receive your message
[3127.62 → 3128.88] Spoken to us this morning
[3128.88 → 3129.92] By Pastor Todd
[3129.92 → 3131.72] And to work it out
[3131.72 → 3133.12] In our daily prayer
[3133.12 → 3134.28] And practice
[3134.28 → 3137.36] We have come
[3137.36 → 3138.44] Having experienced
[3138.44 → 3140.38] A wide variety of work
[3140.38 → 3141.62] This week
[3141.62 → 3143.74] A wide variety of experiences
[3143.74 → 3146.62] And it is with those experiences
[3146.62 → 3147.86] As a backdrop
[3147.86 → 3149.92] That we thank you
[3149.92 → 3151.90] For providing for our every need
[3151.90 → 3154.30] And walking with us
[3154.30 → 3155.96] Through difficult circumstances
[3155.96 → 3158.92] In our personal and collective journeys
[3158.92 → 3163.10] We pray for the leadership
[3163.10 → 3165.20] Of our various levels of government
[3165.20 → 3166.94] Be it at the municipal
[3166.94 → 3167.86] Provincial
[3167.86 → 3169.10] And federal levels
[3169.10 → 3171.02] The work is difficult
[3171.02 → 3173.08] And the responsibilities are many
[3173.08 → 3176.08] As is true in our lives
[3176.08 → 3177.96] We pray for the leaders
[3177.96 → 3179.98] That while they will lead with humility
[3179.98 → 3183.30] Will ensure that justice prevails
[3183.30 → 3185.22] And mercy will overflow
[3185.22 → 3186.44] To those in need
[3186.44 → 3189.74] We are very concerned
[3189.74 → 3191.54] About the growing anti-Semitism
[3191.54 → 3193.56] And racism in our countries
[3193.56 → 3195.04] Driven by hate
[3195.04 → 3196.08] And greed
[3196.08 → 3197.18] And envy
[3197.18 → 3199.44] Lord have mercy
[3199.44 → 3202.56] Truth seems to be vanishing
[3202.56 → 3203.34] In the streets
[3203.34 → 3205.36] But Lord we know
[3205.36 → 3206.82] That you are the only truth
[3206.82 → 3208.52] The only way
[3208.52 → 3210.24] And the only light
[3210.24 → 3212.86] We pray for truth
[3212.86 → 3214.42] And reconciliation
[3214.42 → 3216.18] With indigenous people
[3216.18 → 3217.62] Again having heard
[3217.62 → 3218.64] Some horrible news
[3218.64 → 3219.18] This week
[3219.18 → 3222.72] That 215 children's bodies
[3222.72 → 3224.96] Were found in a common grave
[3224.96 → 3226.82] At a residential school
[3226.82 → 3228.64] At a former residential school
[3228.64 → 3229.44] In Kamloops
[3229.44 → 3232.36] And the raw hurts
[3232.36 → 3233.64] That that brings up again
[3233.64 → 3235.46] We pray that those
[3235.46 → 3237.60] Who will work through this
[3237.60 → 3239.98] Recent incident
[3239.98 → 3243.54] Will assist
[3243.54 → 3245.18] In bringing truth
[3245.18 → 3246.58] And reconciliation
[3246.58 → 3247.52] To that
[3247.52 → 3249.60] Incident
[3249.60 → 3252.38] We pray for lasting peace
[3252.38 → 3253.36] Between Israel
[3253.36 → 3254.18] And Palestine
[3254.18 → 3255.76] We wonder
[3255.76 → 3257.00] If we can even hope
[3257.00 → 3258.76] That that will ever happen
[3258.76 → 3260.88] The lives lost
[3260.88 → 3262.40] In the last bombing attacks
[3262.40 → 3263.46] Are so tragic
[3263.46 → 3264.88] And the cycle
[3264.88 → 3266.68] Just keeps on going
[3266.68 → 3267.36] And going
[3267.36 → 3268.90] We know
[3268.90 → 3269.70] That those who live
[3269.70 → 3270.52] By the sword
[3270.52 → 3272.40] Die by the sword
[3272.40 → 3274.72] Lord we pray for peace
[3274.72 → 3277.04] And Lord have mercy
[3277.04 → 3279.10] We thank you
[3279.10 → 3280.38] That the planting season
[3280.38 → 3282.70] For the farming community
[3282.70 → 3284.34] Is coming to an end
[3284.34 → 3286.02] All the seeding is done
[3286.02 → 3287.68] And now we pray Lord
[3287.68 → 3288.58] That we will have
[3288.58 → 3289.76] A good season of growth
[3289.76 → 3291.32] And a good harvest
[3291.32 → 3292.82] This coming fall
[3292.82 → 3294.80] We trust that you will
[3294.80 → 3295.98] Provide the increase
[3295.98 → 3299.40] We are very encouraged
[3299.40 → 3300.50] With the recent announcement
[3300.50 → 3301.74] From the health minister
[3301.74 → 3303.52] That in-person worship
[3303.52 → 3304.30] Will once again
[3304.30 → 3304.90] Be permitted
[3304.90 → 3306.68] Though we know
[3306.68 → 3307.68] It will be with a limited
[3307.68 → 3308.84] Number of worshippers
[3308.84 → 3309.56] At a time
[3309.56 → 3311.54] We are so thankful
[3311.54 → 3312.36] That this will again
[3312.36 → 3313.10] Be possible
[3313.10 → 3314.78] As Sunday worship
[3314.78 → 3315.22] Together
[3315.22 → 3316.02] Is such
[3316.02 → 3317.46] A vital part
[3317.46 → 3318.04] Of fellowship
[3318.04 → 3319.32] And encouragement
[3319.32 → 3321.02] We pray
[3321.02 → 3321.90] That plants
[3321.90 → 3322.54] Can be quickly
[3322.54 → 3323.16] Put together
[3323.16 → 3324.94] So that in-person worship
[3324.94 → 3325.58] Can begin
[3325.58 → 3326.52] Next week
[3326.52 → 3326.86] Sunday
[3326.86 → 3329.62] There are many
[3329.62 → 3330.22] Of our members
[3330.22 → 3331.02] Experiencing
[3331.02 → 3332.24] Various health concerns
[3332.24 → 3332.52] Too
[3332.52 → 3334.32] We pray for
[3334.32 → 3335.28] Julie Belly
[3335.28 → 3336.82] Who is scheduled
[3336.82 → 3338.30] For gallbladder surgery
[3338.30 → 3339.38] On June the 3rd
[3339.38 → 3341.08] We pray that
[3341.08 → 3341.56] The surgery
[3341.56 → 3343.06] Will be successful
[3343.06 → 3344.88] And that Julie
[3344.88 → 3345.50] Will heal
[3345.50 → 3346.30] Well
[3346.30 → 3347.96] We thank you

[3354.40 → 3357.32] Others are struggling
[3357.32 → 3358.22] With cancer too
[3358.22 → 3359.56] And we pray

[3373.50 → 3374.22] So much better
[3374.22 → 3376.58] For Andre Grotendorst

[3482.60 → 3483.46] Who are on the committee
[3483.46 → 3484.64] That work so hard
[3484.64 → 3486.98] To settle these folks in
[3486.98 → 3490.92] Now that we have heard
[3490.92 → 3492.26] And been taught once again
[3492.26 → 3493.86] On how essential it is
[3493.86 → 3495.48] To share our faith with others
[3495.48 → 3497.40] May we go out from here
[3497.40 → 3498.84] Strengthened by your word
[3498.84 → 3499.64] And spirit
[3499.64 → 3501.58] For thine is the kingdom
[3501.58 → 3502.40] And the power
[3502.40 → 3503.20] And the glory
[3503.20 → 3504.14] Forever
[3504.14 → 3505.88] And we pray all this
[3505.88 → 3506.96] In the name of our Saviour
[3506.96 → 3508.14] And Lord
[3508.14 → 3509.80] Jesus Christ
[3509.80 → 3510.66] Amen
[3510.66 → 3517.16] It's an honour for me
[3517.16 → 3519.62] To give us a word of blessing
[3519.62 → 3521.64] As we leave this worship service
[3521.64 → 3522.80] And my hope and prayer
[3522.80 → 3524.62] Is that all of us
[3524.62 → 3525.92] Like our African brother
[3525.92 → 3526.92] That we read about
[3526.92 → 3527.78] In today's story
[3527.78 → 3528.68] From Acts 12
[3528.68 → 3530.34] Will go on our way
[3530.34 → 3531.42] Rejoicing now
[3531.42 → 3532.52] Having encountered
[3532.52 → 3533.40] Jesus Christ
[3533.40 → 3534.84] And his saving word
[3534.84 → 3536.32] In holy scripture
[3536.32 → 3537.44] Through song
[3537.44 → 3538.12] Through prayer
[3538.12 → 3539.08] And through sermon
[3539.08 → 3541.12] So may we leave here
[3541.12 → 3541.82] Rejoicing
[3541.82 → 3544.40] In the grace of our Lord
[3544.40 → 3545.10] Jesus Christ
[3545.10 → 3546.96] And the love of God
[3546.96 → 3547.46] Our Father
[3547.46 → 3548.56] And the fellowship
[3548.56 → 3549.88] Of the Holy Spirit
[3549.88 → 3550.62] Amen
