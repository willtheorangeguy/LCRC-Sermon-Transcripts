[320.00 --> 324.00]  Good morning and welcome to our service here at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[324.00 --> 335.00]  No matter who we are or what's going on in our lives, God invites us to come with open hearts to receive from him and also to bless him this morning.
[335.00 --> 344.00]  Also a special welcome to Pastor Gary Rosma who will bring us God's message today and our greetings to Jenny as well, even though she's not here.
[344.00 --> 353.00]  Our designated offering this morning is for Delta Christian School, providing a Christian worldview education for children in this community.
[353.00 --> 360.00]  We are thankful for educators who take seriously the task of teaching children well.
[360.00 --> 366.00]  You may give your offering online or drop it off at the church during the week.
[366.00 --> 379.00]  This is the first Sunday in Lent and I'd like to draw your attention to the beautiful banner behind me created by Anita DeVos who is a sort of an in-house artist in this church.
[379.00 --> 386.00]  We are thankful for her creativity, her work with colors and just the beauty of the symbolism.
[386.00 --> 400.00]  Lent is the six weeks leading up to the death of Christ, which means that this past Wednesday was Ash Wednesday, the first day marking the Lent season.
[400.00 --> 413.00]  At my workplace years ago we had a courier who would come in every Ash Wednesday with a mark of the cross on his forehead smudged in ashes.
[413.00 --> 419.00]  The first time I saw that I was taken aback because I wasn't familiar with that practice.
[419.00 --> 429.00]  To me it presented a bold, humble and beautiful statement of confession in Christ.
[429.00 --> 436.00]  We too are called to worship our God with humility and boldness in these words from Isaiah 44.
[436.00 --> 444.00]  I am the first and the last. There is no other God who is like me.
[444.00 --> 451.00]  I have swept away your sins like a cloud. I have scattered your offenses like the morning mist.
[451.00 --> 457.00]  Oh, return to me for I have paid the price to set you free.
[457.00 --> 463.00]  Our redeeming God greets us now with grace, mercy and peace.
[463.00 --> 471.00]  I encourage you to call someone after the service to offer a gracious greeting and maybe some caring and warm conversation.
[471.00 --> 474.00]  Let's sing together in worship.
[474.00 --> 492.00]  Let's sing together in worship.
[492.00 --> 502.00]  Oh, return partner with grace, mercy and grace, mercy and voice,
[502.00 --> 508.00]  grace, mercy and respect my family.
[508.00 --> 514.00]  Yes, forget sing.
[514.00 --> 519.00]  But I follow this in worship where you are in worship.
[519.00 --> 522.00]  Blessed be your name
[522.56 --> 528.82]  Every blessing you pour out of
[528.82 --> 532.00]  Turn back to praise
[532.52 --> 537.06]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[537.06 --> 539.00]  Still I will say
[539.74 --> 543.00]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[543.70 --> 547.00]  Blessed be your name
[547.00 --> 552.04]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[552.04 --> 556.88]  Blessed be your glorious name
[556.88 --> 561.44]  Blessed be your name
[561.44 --> 565.46]  When the sun's shining down on me
[565.46 --> 569.00]  When the world's all as it should be
[569.70 --> 572.36]  Blessed be your name
[572.36 --> 577.40]  Blessed be your name
[577.40 --> 581.56]  On road marked with suffering
[581.56 --> 585.64]  Those pain in the offering
[585.64 --> 589.28]  Blessed be your name
[589.28 --> 594.44]  Every blessing you pour out of
[594.44 --> 598.44]  Turn back to praise
[598.44 --> 603.34]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[603.34 --> 605.38]  Still I will say
[605.38 --> 609.38]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[609.38 --> 613.38]  Blessed be your name
[613.38 --> 617.38]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[617.38 --> 622.38]  Blessed be your glorious name
[622.38 --> 627.42]  You give and take away
[627.42 --> 631.42]  You give and take away
[631.42 --> 635.42]  My heart will choose to sing
[635.42 --> 640.42]  Lord blessed be your name
[640.42 --> 644.26]  You give and take away
[644.26 --> 648.30]  You give and take away
[648.30 --> 649.30]  You give and take away
[649.30 --> 652.30]  My heart will choose to sing
[652.30 --> 656.30]  Lord blessed be your name
[656.30 --> 665.34]  Blessed be your name
[665.34 --> 671.50]  Blessed be the name
[671.50 --> 673.34]  Blessed be your glorious name
[673.34 --> 675.34]  Blessed be the name
[675.34 --> 677.34]  Blessed be your name
[677.34 --> 680.34]  Blessed be the name
[680.34 --> 682.26]  You give and deviate
[682.26 --> 686.52]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[686.52 --> 691.28]  Blessed be your glorious name
[712.26 --> 722.48]  The hope is built on nothing less
[722.48 --> 727.06]  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[727.06 --> 734.22]  I dare not trust this sweetest friend
[734.22 --> 740.08]  But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[740.08 --> 748.08]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[748.08 --> 754.12]  Weak made strong in Savior's love
[754.12 --> 760.12]  Through this storm, He is known
[760.12 --> 763.26]  Lord of all
[763.26 --> 773.26]  When darkness seems to hide its face
[773.26 --> 779.26]  I rest on His own changing grace
[779.26 --> 785.26]  In every high and stormy day
[785.26 --> 791.26]  My anchor holds within the veil
[791.26 --> 798.26]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[798.26 --> 805.26]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
[805.26 --> 811.26]  Through this storm, He is Lord
[811.26 --> 815.26]  Lord of all
[815.26 --> 825.26]  When He shall come with troubled sight
[825.26 --> 830.26]  Hold that young man in Him profound
[830.26 --> 836.26]  Dressed in His righteousness alone
[836.26 --> 838.26]  For this storm, He is Lord
[838.26 --> 840.26]  For this storm, He is Lord
[840.26 --> 842.26]  Lord of all
[842.26 --> 846.26]  For this storm, He is Lord
[846.26 --> 852.26]  Lord of all
[852.26 --> 854.26]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[854.26 --> 856.26]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
[856.26 --> 858.26]  Through this storm, He is Lord
[858.26 --> 860.26]  Lord of all
[860.26 --> 862.26]  He is Lord
[862.26 --> 866.26]  Lord of all
[866.26 --> 868.26]  Lord of all
[868.26 --> 870.26]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[870.26 --> 874.26]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[874.26 --> 877.26]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
[877.26 --> 878.26]  Through this storm, He is Lord
[878.26 --> 880.26]  Lord of all
[880.26 --> 882.26]  Lord of all
[882.26 --> 886.26]  Through this storm, He is Lord
[886.26 --> 888.26]  Lord of all
[888.26 --> 890.26]  Lord of all
[890.26 --> 901.26]  Lord to us
[901.26 --> 902.26]  Son, we are being c Mangãe
[902.26 --> 904.26]  Lord of all
[904.26 --> 906.26]  For this storm, He is Lord
[906.26 --> 908.26]  Lord of all
[908.26 --> 910.26]  Lord of all
[910.26 --> 928.22]  Wonderful, so wonderful is your unfailing love
[928.22 --> 935.34]  Your cross has spoken mercy over me
[935.34 --> 943.06]  No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[943.06 --> 947.22]  Your heart can fully know
[947.22 --> 954.26]  How glorious, how beautiful you are
[954.26 --> 960.82]  Beautiful one, I love
[960.82 --> 965.60]  Beautiful one, I adore
[965.60 --> 974.54]  Beautiful one, my soul must see
[974.54 --> 980.54]  Powerful, so powerful
[980.54 --> 985.32]  Your glory fills the skies
[985.32 --> 992.32]  Your mighty words display for all to see
[992.32 --> 1004.36]  The beauty of your majesty awaits my heart to see
[1004.36 --> 1012.14]  How marvelous, how wonderful you are
[1012.14 --> 1018.22]  Beautiful one, I love
[1018.22 --> 1022.14]  Beautiful one, I adore
[1022.14 --> 1030.36]  Beautiful one, my soul must see
[1030.36 --> 1038.14]  You opened my eyes to your wonders and you
[1038.14 --> 1042.20]  You captured my heart with this love
[1042.20 --> 1049.14]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you
[1049.14 --> 1057.36]  You opened my eyes to your wonders and you
[1057.36 --> 1061.14]  You captured my heart with this love
[1061.14 --> 1069.14]  Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as you
[1069.14 --> 1075.14]  Beautiful one, I love
[1075.14 --> 1080.28]  Beautiful one, I adore
[1080.28 --> 1088.06]  Beautiful one, my soul must see
[1088.06 --> 1094.06]  Beautiful one, I love
[1094.06 --> 1099.06]  Beautiful one, I adore
[1099.06 --> 1107.06]  Beautiful one, my soul must see
[1107.06 --> 1121.16]  In his devotional book, Seeking God's Face
[1121.16 --> 1123.94]  Phil Reinders describes Lent as
[1123.94 --> 1127.74]  A somber journey of spiritual preparation and renewal
[1127.74 --> 1131.62]  Marked especially by repentance and prayer
[1131.62 --> 1135.78]  He says that we live in a pain-averse culture
[1135.78 --> 1141.92]  Enjoying religious freedom in which we mostly don't suffer for our faith
[1141.92 --> 1147.38]  Lent invites us to willingly identify with Christ's suffering
[1147.38 --> 1150.86]  Through fasting or other form of self-denial
[1150.86 --> 1155.30]  Now to us, all of this may seem very somber
[1155.30 --> 1158.10]  Solemn or even downright depressing
[1158.10 --> 1163.96]  But Reinders says that the spare and sober nature of Lent
[1163.96 --> 1168.00]  Is healthy for the heart and true to the gospel
[1168.00 --> 1175.74]  Calling us to say no to ourselves in order to experience a greater yes in Jesus
[1175.74 --> 1179.38]  Sorrow for our part in Christ's death
[1179.38 --> 1185.46]  Prepares us for a fuller, more joyous experience of redemption and resurrection
[1185.46 --> 1191.28]  Please read Psalm 130 responsibly with me
[1191.28 --> 1196.66]  Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord
[1196.66 --> 1199.20]  Lord, hear my voice
[1199.20 --> 1203.44]  Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy
[1203.44 --> 1207.02]  If you, Lord, kept a record of sins
[1207.02 --> 1208.84]  Lord, who could stand?
[1208.84 --> 1212.06]  But with you there is forgiveness
[1212.06 --> 1216.56]  So that we can, with reverence, serve you
[1216.56 --> 1220.26]  I wait for the Lord
[1220.26 --> 1222.52]  My whole being waits
[1222.52 --> 1225.44]  And in his word I put my hope
[1225.44 --> 1227.96]  I wait for the Lord
[1227.96 --> 1230.48]  More than watchmen wait for the morning
[1230.48 --> 1233.60]  More than watchmen wait for the morning
[1233.60 --> 1236.84]  Israel, put your hope in the Lord
[1236.84 --> 1239.02]  For with the Lord is unfailing love
[1239.02 --> 1241.32]  And with him is full redemption
[1241.32 --> 1247.08]  He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins
[1247.08 --> 1249.60]  Please pray with me
[1249.60 --> 1253.52]  Gracious, loving God
[1253.52 --> 1255.76]  We can never thank you enough
[1255.76 --> 1258.82]  For drawing us in and loving us unconditionally
[1258.82 --> 1261.92]  Forgive us when we turn away from you
[1261.92 --> 1264.14]  By your Holy Spirit
[1264.14 --> 1266.70]  Turn us toward you during this Lenten season
[1266.70 --> 1270.18]  Give us the courage to confront our own darkness
[1270.18 --> 1272.02]  And lay it bare before you
[1272.02 --> 1275.74]  May this experience bring us great freedom and joy
[1275.74 --> 1277.10]  As you intend
[1277.10 --> 1280.42]  Through Christ, the one who saves us
[1280.42 --> 1281.38]  Amen
[1288.82 --> 1305.86]  I hear the Savior say
[1305.86 --> 1309.86]  Thy strength indeed is small
[1309.86 --> 1313.66]  Child of goodness, won't you pray
[1313.66 --> 1318.14]  Find in me thine all in all
[1318.14 --> 1322.62]  Jesus paid it all
[1322.62 --> 1326.42]  All to him I owe
[1326.42 --> 1330.94]  Sin hath left a crimson stain
[1330.94 --> 1335.18]  He washed it white as snow
[1335.18 --> 1341.00]  Lord, now indeed I find
[1341.00 --> 1345.06]  Thy power and thine alone
[1345.06 --> 1349.28]  Can change the leprous spots
[1349.28 --> 1353.42]  Can man the heart of stone
[1353.42 --> 1357.68]  Jesus paid it all
[1357.68 --> 1361.26]  All to him I owe
[1361.26 --> 1365.96]  Sin hath left a crimson stain
[1365.96 --> 1369.84]  He washed it white as snow
[1369.84 --> 1375.32]  For death and a crimson stain
[1375.32 --> 1376.12]  For death and a crimson stain
[1376.12 --> 1380.24]  Whereby thy grace to claim
[1380.24 --> 1384.24]  I washed my garments white
[1384.24 --> 1388.44]  In the blood of Calvary's death
[1388.44 --> 1393.12]  Jesus paid it all
[1393.12 --> 1394.12]  All to him I owe
[1394.12 --> 1396.60]  All to him I owe
[1396.60 --> 1401.40]  Sin hath left a crimson stain
[1401.40 --> 1405.32]  He washed it white as snow
[1405.32 --> 1411.60]  And when before the throne
[1411.60 --> 1415.60]  I stand in him complete
[1415.60 --> 1419.54]  Jesus died my soul to save
[1419.54 --> 1423.60]  My lips shall still repeat
[1423.60 --> 1428.08]  Jesus paid it all
[1428.08 --> 1431.88]  All to him I owe
[1431.88 --> 1433.88]  All to him I owe
[1433.88 --> 1437.14]  Sin hath left a crimson stain
[1437.14 --> 1441.08]  He washed it white as snow
[1441.08 --> 1459.42]  Well, good morning
[1459.42 --> 1462.00]  And it's good to be with you again
[1462.00 --> 1465.18]  After a bit of a long hiatus
[1465.18 --> 1467.90]  And interesting every time I come
[1467.90 --> 1469.68]  It's a different situation in the church
[1469.68 --> 1471.62]  And because of this whole pandemic
[1471.62 --> 1473.50]  So, but whatever the case
[1473.50 --> 1476.26]  We still gather to worship our Lord and Savior
[1476.26 --> 1479.58]  And a pleasure to be with you here
[1479.58 --> 1482.14]  The passage today
[1482.14 --> 1484.08]  I invite you to turn to that now
[1484.08 --> 1486.52]  Is in 2 Kings chapter 3
[1486.52 --> 1488.68]  And as you're looking for that
[1488.68 --> 1490.86]  I wanted to show you a couple of pictures
[1490.86 --> 1494.78]  Recently from the visiting
[1494.78 --> 1498.12]  The ship visiting that we continue to do
[1498.12 --> 1501.32]  COVID-19 of course continues to mean
[1501.32 --> 1503.78]  Visits to the centers
[1503.78 --> 1508.18]  The seafarer centers are very limited
[1508.18 --> 1509.64]  The number that are allowed
[1509.64 --> 1510.56]  Some are now
[1510.56 --> 1512.26]  But many are still not
[1512.26 --> 1513.98]  But we still are able to visit
[1513.98 --> 1516.60]  And if you could put up the first picture
[1516.60 --> 1519.90]  Recently a small ship
[1519.90 --> 1521.06]  Relatively small
[1521.06 --> 1523.90]  Showed up here in Vancouver
[1523.90 --> 1526.14]  It was at the sugar
[1526.14 --> 1529.02]  BC sugar terminal
[1529.02 --> 1531.50]  And so it was a ship
[1531.50 --> 1533.48]  That's actually bringing in
[1533.48 --> 1536.30]  Bulk items
[1536.30 --> 1537.92]  In sugar from Guatemala
[1537.92 --> 1540.40]  Most of the natural resources
[1540.40 --> 1541.28]  We ship out
[1541.28 --> 1542.50]  Grains and coal
[1542.50 --> 1543.90]  And things like that
[1543.90 --> 1545.50]  But this is one that actually brings it in
[1545.50 --> 1546.52]  But I was struck
[1546.52 --> 1547.56]  I don't know if you can see it on there
[1547.56 --> 1548.76]  But the name of the ship
[1548.76 --> 1549.92]  Was the Frisiana
[1549.92 --> 1552.00]  And I thought
[1552.00 --> 1553.52]  Well that's very interesting
[1553.52 --> 1554.90]  And it's a flag
[1554.90 --> 1555.98]  It's a Dutch flag
[1555.98 --> 1557.84]  So I thought
[1557.84 --> 1559.08]  I've got to go see this ship
[1559.08 --> 1561.16]  And Ernst by the way is here
[1561.16 --> 1562.92]  And he's giving me the thumbs up on this one
[1562.92 --> 1563.94]  He thinks this is awesome
[1563.94 --> 1565.24]  And so I said
[1565.24 --> 1566.48]  I've got to go visit this ship
[1566.48 --> 1567.44]  And I went on
[1567.44 --> 1568.00]  It was just
[1568.00 --> 1568.96]  It was a small ship
[1568.96 --> 1569.32]  As I said
[1569.32 --> 1571.72]  Just three holds
[1571.72 --> 1573.46]  And I went on board
[1573.46 --> 1574.58]  And I met a couple
[1574.58 --> 1577.02]  Of the Filipino chief mate
[1577.02 --> 1577.56]  But I said
[1577.56 --> 1579.10]  Well who's your captain
[1579.10 --> 1579.52]  And he said
[1579.52 --> 1580.64]  Well he's up on the bridge
[1580.64 --> 1582.20]  He's a Dutchman
[1582.20 --> 1582.82]  I said
[1582.82 --> 1584.16]  Well I've got to meet this guy
[1584.16 --> 1585.70]  You don't meet that many Dutch anymore
[1585.70 --> 1586.58]  Not like years ago
[1586.58 --> 1588.86]  It's quite rare actually
[1588.86 --> 1589.62]  So I said
[1589.62 --> 1591.02]  Let him know I'm here
[1591.02 --> 1592.64]  Let him know I'm a Rosma
[1592.64 --> 1594.10]  Because this was the
[1594.10 --> 1596.08]  Boomsma shipping company
[1596.08 --> 1598.08]  And so he
[1598.08 --> 1598.88]  And immediately
[1598.88 --> 1600.10]  I got the call back saying
[1600.10 --> 1602.00]  He must come up on the bridge
[1602.00 --> 1604.08]  And so up I went to the bridge
[1604.08 --> 1606.22]  And again it was a small
[1606.22 --> 1607.42]  Only eight crew
[1607.42 --> 1608.88]  Eight crew
[1608.88 --> 1610.42]  Including the captain
[1610.42 --> 1611.70]  He was the only Dutchman
[1611.70 --> 1612.44]  One Russian
[1612.44 --> 1613.40]  Chief engineer
[1613.40 --> 1614.10]  And the rest were
[1614.10 --> 1615.06]  Six Filipinos
[1615.06 --> 1616.52]  I'd never seen a crew that small
[1616.52 --> 1619.00]  But we had coffee up on the bridge
[1619.00 --> 1620.56]  Physically distanced of course
[1620.56 --> 1622.34]  And I had a wonderful time
[1622.34 --> 1623.36]  I ended up visiting the ship
[1623.36 --> 1624.26]  About three times
[1624.26 --> 1625.30]  And had coffee with him
[1625.30 --> 1625.86]  Several times
[1625.86 --> 1626.90]  So it was great to meet
[1626.90 --> 1628.04]  This Dutchman
[1628.04 --> 1629.56]  And really warm fellowship
[1629.56 --> 1630.76]  Was able to pray with him
[1630.76 --> 1631.40]  At one point
[1631.40 --> 1633.20]  And really had some
[1633.20 --> 1634.30]  Special time
[1634.30 --> 1635.18]  And then
[1635.18 --> 1635.98]  The same day
[1635.98 --> 1637.08]  That I first met them
[1637.08 --> 1638.66]  I came back to the center
[1638.66 --> 1639.62]  There was a
[1639.62 --> 1641.48]  Filipino seafarer
[1641.48 --> 1643.46]  In the seafarer center
[1643.46 --> 1644.82]  Back downtown here
[1644.82 --> 1646.66]  Got chatting with him
[1646.66 --> 1647.70]  We were talking a little bit
[1647.70 --> 1648.72]  And he said
[1648.72 --> 1649.88]  By the way
[1649.88 --> 1651.32]  Do you know anyone
[1651.32 --> 1652.58]  Do you happen to know anyone
[1652.58 --> 1653.60]  Connected with the
[1653.60 --> 1655.82]  Christian Reformed Church?
[1656.66 --> 1657.62]  And I said
[1657.62 --> 1658.98]  Maybe
[1658.98 --> 1660.48]  Of course
[1660.48 --> 1660.92]  I said
[1660.92 --> 1661.30]  Yeah
[1661.30 --> 1661.70]  Yeah
[1661.70 --> 1662.16]  I'm
[1662.16 --> 1662.50]  You know
[1662.50 --> 1662.86]  He said
[1662.86 --> 1663.26]  Really
[1663.26 --> 1663.90]  He said
[1663.90 --> 1664.74]  I'm with the
[1664.74 --> 1665.86]  Christian Reformed Church
[1665.86 --> 1667.14]  In the Philippines
[1667.14 --> 1669.82]  And I had been wondering
[1669.82 --> 1670.30]  A long time
[1670.30 --> 1671.12]  Because I knew there was
[1671.12 --> 1671.98]  A Christian Reformed Church
[1671.98 --> 1672.46]  In the Philippines
[1672.46 --> 1672.80]  And I thought
[1672.80 --> 1673.92]  How long before I actually
[1673.92 --> 1674.70]  Meet somebody from the
[1674.70 --> 1675.30]  Christian Reformed Church
[1675.30 --> 1675.74]  In the Philippines
[1675.74 --> 1677.02]  And here he was
[1677.02 --> 1678.20]  And it turns out
[1678.20 --> 1679.44]  That the
[1679.44 --> 1680.34]  The missionary
[1680.34 --> 1682.02]  Pastor for many years
[1682.02 --> 1683.04]  Of their church
[1683.04 --> 1684.46]  Was a
[1684.46 --> 1685.08]  Gentleman
[1685.08 --> 1685.80]  Who I
[1685.80 --> 1686.90]  Actually
[1686.90 --> 1687.94]  Traveled
[1687.94 --> 1688.74]  For a bit
[1688.74 --> 1690.16]  Through the Philippines
[1690.16 --> 1691.12]  With
[1691.12 --> 1692.46]  Way back in 1986
[1692.46 --> 1693.58]  And we almost got
[1693.58 --> 1694.08]  Mugged
[1694.08 --> 1694.68]  Together
[1694.68 --> 1696.12]  And so I said
[1696.12 --> 1697.26]  How's he doing?
[1697.40 --> 1698.40]  And so I got connected
[1698.40 --> 1699.46]  With this old missionary
[1699.46 --> 1699.84]  Pastor
[1699.84 --> 1700.70]  And I actually
[1700.70 --> 1701.90]  Preached once
[1701.90 --> 1703.16]  In his home church
[1703.16 --> 1703.62]  Years ago
[1703.62 --> 1704.40]  Before he was even
[1704.40 --> 1704.88]  A member there
[1704.88 --> 1706.04]  So that was really special
[1706.04 --> 1706.84]  A couple of
[1706.84 --> 1708.32]  Interesting meetings
[1708.32 --> 1709.36]  Just not this past week
[1709.36 --> 1710.20]  But the week before
[1710.20 --> 1710.88]  That we had
[1710.88 --> 1712.18]  Again
[1712.18 --> 1713.34]  Ship visiting goes on
[1713.34 --> 1714.46]  And thanks for your prayers
[1714.46 --> 1715.34]  And support
[1715.34 --> 1715.92]  There's more
[1715.92 --> 1717.10]  News
[1717.10 --> 1717.70]  A newsletter
[1717.70 --> 1718.48]  Will be coming out
[1718.48 --> 1718.90]  Shortly
[1718.90 --> 1720.84]  Second Kings
[1720.84 --> 1721.72]  Chapter 3
[1721.72 --> 1722.12]  We're going to be
[1722.12 --> 1722.68]  Reading from there
[1722.68 --> 1723.54]  It's a long
[1723.54 --> 1724.70]  Fairly long
[1724.70 --> 1725.46]  Chapter
[1725.46 --> 1727.82]  And it's a difficult one
[1727.82 --> 1728.30]  I tell you
[1728.30 --> 1729.14]  There were a few times
[1729.14 --> 1730.16]  This past few weeks
[1730.16 --> 1730.96]  That I was working on this
[1730.96 --> 1732.60]  That I seriously thought
[1732.60 --> 1734.68]  Maybe I'll just skip this chapter
[1734.68 --> 1735.36]  And go to the next
[1735.36 --> 1735.88]  But anyway
[1735.88 --> 1736.44]  I thought
[1736.44 --> 1737.70]  Let's press on
[1737.70 --> 1738.52]  Before we do that
[1738.52 --> 1739.72]  Let's bow in a word of prayer
[1739.72 --> 1742.76]  Heavenly Father
[1742.76 --> 1744.42]  We thank you for your word
[1744.42 --> 1746.76]  Prepare our hearts
[1746.76 --> 1749.42]  Open our eyes
[1749.42 --> 1751.68]  That we may behold
[1751.68 --> 1753.36]  Wondrous things
[1753.36 --> 1754.84]  From your word
[1754.84 --> 1757.82]  In Jesus Christ
[1757.82 --> 1759.78]  Our Lord and Savior's name
[1759.78 --> 1760.26]  We pray
[1760.26 --> 1761.84]  Amen
[1761.84 --> 1766.94]  I've been doing a series
[1766.94 --> 1767.96]  Through Elisha
[1767.96 --> 1769.30]  Some of you will remember
[1769.30 --> 1770.02]  Hopefully many
[1770.02 --> 1772.20]  That we saw
[1772.20 --> 1773.08]  Last chapter
[1773.08 --> 1773.90]  I spent several
[1773.90 --> 1775.26]  Sermons on that
[1775.26 --> 1776.62]  Going through
[1776.62 --> 1779.86]  Elisha being sort of
[1779.86 --> 1782.00]  Authorized as
[1782.00 --> 1783.62]  The successor
[1783.62 --> 1785.06]  To Elijah
[1785.06 --> 1786.46]  And now Elisha
[1786.46 --> 1787.58]  Is the Lord's prophet
[1787.58 --> 1788.60]  But now
[1788.60 --> 1789.52]  He comes in
[1789.52 --> 1790.80]  In a different context
[1790.80 --> 1795.30]  Second Kings Chapter 3
[1795.30 --> 1796.72]  Joram
[1796.72 --> 1798.56]  And sometimes it's
[1798.56 --> 1799.30]  Yehoram
[1799.30 --> 1800.22]  Or Yoram
[1800.22 --> 1800.96]  Or Yehoram
[1800.96 --> 1802.20]  It's actually
[1802.20 --> 1802.94]  The Hebrew says
[1802.94 --> 1803.44]  Yehoram
[1803.44 --> 1804.40]  But it's hard
[1804.40 --> 1804.92]  To differentiate
[1804.92 --> 1805.88]  From others
[1805.88 --> 1806.72]  And it can go
[1806.72 --> 1807.24]  Either way
[1807.24 --> 1808.00]  So the NIV
[1808.00 --> 1808.84]  Translates as
[1808.84 --> 1809.24]  Joram
[1809.24 --> 1811.04]  Joram son of Ahab
[1811.04 --> 1812.32]  Became king of Israel
[1812.32 --> 1813.00]  In Samaria
[1813.00 --> 1814.14]  In the 18th year
[1814.14 --> 1815.14]  Of Jehoshaphat
[1815.14 --> 1816.00]  King of Judah
[1816.00 --> 1817.16]  And he reigned
[1817.16 --> 1818.36]  Twelve years
[1818.36 --> 1820.00]  He did evil
[1820.00 --> 1820.98]  In the eyes of the Lord
[1820.98 --> 1822.84]  But not as his father
[1822.84 --> 1823.74]  And mother had done
[1823.74 --> 1824.50]  His father remember
[1824.50 --> 1825.34]  Was Ahab
[1825.34 --> 1828.36]  He got rid of
[1828.36 --> 1829.24]  The sacred stone
[1829.24 --> 1829.86]  Of Baal
[1829.86 --> 1830.68]  That his father
[1830.68 --> 1831.36]  Had made
[1831.36 --> 1831.90]  Nevertheless
[1831.90 --> 1833.04]  He clung to
[1833.04 --> 1834.60]  The sins of Jeroboam
[1834.60 --> 1835.40]  Son of Nebat
[1835.40 --> 1836.50]  Which he had
[1836.50 --> 1837.38]  Caused Israel
[1837.38 --> 1837.92]  To commit
[1837.92 --> 1838.84]  He did not
[1838.84 --> 1839.96]  Turn away from them
[1839.96 --> 1842.32]  Now Misha
[1842.32 --> 1843.62]  King of Moab
[1843.62 --> 1844.78]  Raised sheep
[1844.78 --> 1845.58]  And he had to pay
[1845.58 --> 1846.34]  The king of Israel
[1846.34 --> 1846.98]  A tribute
[1846.98 --> 1848.60]  Of a hundred thousand
[1848.60 --> 1849.12]  Lambs
[1849.12 --> 1849.88]  And the wool
[1849.88 --> 1850.74]  Of a hundred thousand
[1850.74 --> 1851.20]  Rams
[1851.20 --> 1853.56]  But after Ahab died
[1853.56 --> 1854.66]  The king of Moab
[1854.66 --> 1856.54]  Rebelled against
[1856.54 --> 1857.44]  The king of Israel
[1857.44 --> 1858.56]  So that the king
[1858.56 --> 1859.44]  So that king
[1859.44 --> 1861.32]  So at that time
[1861.32 --> 1862.02]  King Joram
[1862.02 --> 1863.48]  Set out from Samaria
[1863.48 --> 1864.20]  And mobilized
[1864.20 --> 1865.06]  All Israel
[1865.06 --> 1866.68]  He also sent this message
[1866.68 --> 1867.62]  To Jehoshaphat
[1867.62 --> 1868.42]  King of Judah
[1868.42 --> 1869.82]  The king of Moab
[1869.82 --> 1870.92]  Has rebelled against me
[1870.92 --> 1871.84]  Will you go with me
[1871.84 --> 1873.16]  To fight against Moab
[1873.16 --> 1875.38]  I will go with you
[1875.38 --> 1875.96]  He replied
[1875.96 --> 1877.54]  I am as you are
[1877.54 --> 1878.54]  Your people
[1878.54 --> 1879.04]  As my
[1879.04 --> 1879.68]  My people
[1879.68 --> 1880.34]  As your people
[1880.34 --> 1881.26]  My horses
[1881.26 --> 1882.66]  As your horses
[1882.66 --> 1884.84]  By what route
[1884.84 --> 1885.56]  Shall we attack
[1885.56 --> 1886.06]  He asked
[1886.06 --> 1887.60]  Through the desert
[1887.60 --> 1888.36]  Of Edom
[1888.36 --> 1889.20]  He answered
[1889.20 --> 1890.98]  So the king of Israel
[1890.98 --> 1892.06]  Set out with the king
[1892.06 --> 1892.44]  Of Judah
[1892.44 --> 1893.46]  And the king of Edom
[1893.46 --> 1895.24]  After a roundabout march
[1895.24 --> 1896.08]  Of seven days
[1896.08 --> 1897.34]  The army had no more
[1897.34 --> 1898.28]  Water for themselves
[1898.28 --> 1899.28]  Or for the animals
[1899.28 --> 1899.78]  With them
[1899.78 --> 1900.46]  What?
[1900.76 --> 1901.90]  Exclaimed the king of Israel
[1901.90 --> 1903.22]  Has the lord called us
[1903.22 --> 1904.38]  Three kings together
[1904.38 --> 1905.56]  Only to deliver us
[1905.56 --> 1906.86]  Into the hands of Moab
[1906.86 --> 1909.34]  But Jehoshaphat asked
[1909.34 --> 1911.02]  Is there no prophet
[1911.02 --> 1912.08]  Of the lord here
[1912.08 --> 1913.26]  Through whom we may
[1913.26 --> 1914.44]  Inquire of the lord?
[1915.56 --> 1916.62]  An officer of the king
[1916.62 --> 1917.42]  Of Israel answered
[1917.42 --> 1919.26]  Elisha son of Shaphat
[1919.26 --> 1919.92]  Is here
[1919.92 --> 1921.52]  He used to pour water
[1921.52 --> 1922.88]  On the hands of Elijah
[1922.88 --> 1923.94]  Which is a sign
[1923.94 --> 1925.06]  Of being the
[1925.06 --> 1926.84]  Really the personal servant
[1926.84 --> 1927.60]  Of the
[1927.60 --> 1929.08]  Of Elijah
[1929.08 --> 1931.24]  Jehoshaphat said
[1931.24 --> 1932.12]  The word of the lord
[1932.12 --> 1932.72]  Is with him
[1932.72 --> 1933.70]  So the king of Israel
[1933.70 --> 1934.52]  And Jehoshaphat
[1934.52 --> 1936.20]  And the king of Edom
[1936.20 --> 1937.34]  Went down to him
[1937.34 --> 1938.86]  Elisha said
[1938.86 --> 1939.64]  To the king of Israel
[1939.64 --> 1941.78]  Why do you want
[1941.78 --> 1942.58]  To involve me?
[1942.82 --> 1943.62]  Go to the prophets
[1943.62 --> 1944.42]  Of your father
[1944.42 --> 1945.18]  And the prophets
[1945.18 --> 1945.92]  Of your mother
[1945.92 --> 1947.66]  No
[1947.66 --> 1948.54]  The king of Israel
[1948.54 --> 1949.08]  Answered
[1949.08 --> 1950.20]  Because it was the lord
[1950.20 --> 1951.00]  Who called us
[1951.00 --> 1951.88]  Three kings together
[1951.88 --> 1952.70]  To deliver us
[1952.70 --> 1953.88]  Into the hands of Moab
[1953.88 --> 1955.94]  Elisha said
[1955.94 --> 1957.66]  As surely as the lord
[1957.66 --> 1958.46]  Almighty lives
[1958.46 --> 1959.18]  Whom I serve
[1959.18 --> 1960.44]  If I did not
[1960.44 --> 1961.04]  Have respect
[1961.04 --> 1961.74]  For the presence
[1961.74 --> 1962.60]  Of Jehoshaphat
[1962.60 --> 1963.24]  King of Judah
[1963.24 --> 1964.56]  I would not pay
[1964.56 --> 1966.00]  Any attention to you
[1966.00 --> 1967.40]  But now
[1967.40 --> 1968.78]  Bring me a harpist
[1968.78 --> 1970.20]  While the harpist
[1970.20 --> 1970.78]  Was playing
[1970.78 --> 1971.66]  The hand of the lord
[1971.66 --> 1972.66]  Came on Elisha
[1972.66 --> 1973.18]  And he said
[1973.18 --> 1974.76]  This is what the lord
[1974.76 --> 1975.32]  Says
[1975.32 --> 1977.80]  I will fill this valley
[1977.80 --> 1979.10]  With pools of water
[1979.10 --> 1980.18]  For this is what
[1980.18 --> 1980.90]  The lord says
[1980.90 --> 1981.50]  You will see
[1981.50 --> 1982.28]  Neither wind
[1982.28 --> 1983.12]  Nor rain
[1983.12 --> 1984.14]  Yet this valley
[1984.14 --> 1984.94]  Will be filled
[1984.94 --> 1985.52]  With water
[1985.52 --> 1986.44]  And you
[1986.44 --> 1987.36]  Your cattle
[1987.36 --> 1988.62]  And your other animals
[1988.62 --> 1989.20]  Will drink
[1989.20 --> 1991.80]  This is an easy thing
[1991.80 --> 1995.16]  This is an easy thing
[1995.16 --> 1996.02]  In the eyes of the lord
[1996.02 --> 1997.30]  He will also deliver
[1997.30 --> 1998.68]  Moab into your hands
[1998.68 --> 1999.68]  You will overthrow
[1999.68 --> 2001.10]  Every fortified city
[2001.10 --> 2002.56]  And every major town
[2002.56 --> 2003.48]  You will cut down
[2003.48 --> 2004.32]  Every good tree
[2004.32 --> 2005.62]  Stop up all the springs
[2005.62 --> 2007.22]  And ruin every good field
[2007.22 --> 2007.98]  With stones
[2007.98 --> 2010.24]  The next morning
[2010.24 --> 2011.54]  About the time of offering
[2011.54 --> 2013.30]  The sacrifice
[2013.30 --> 2014.28]  There it was
[2014.28 --> 2015.46]  Water flowing
[2015.46 --> 2016.60]  From the direction of Edom
[2016.60 --> 2017.46]  And the land was
[2017.46 --> 2018.56]  Filled with water
[2018.56 --> 2021.56]  Now all the Moabites
[2021.56 --> 2023.14]  Had heard that the kings
[2023.14 --> 2024.18]  Had come to fight
[2024.18 --> 2024.70]  Against them
[2024.70 --> 2026.14]  So every man
[2026.14 --> 2026.88]  Young and old
[2026.88 --> 2027.68]  Who could bear arms
[2027.68 --> 2028.42]  Was called up
[2028.42 --> 2029.62]  And stationed on the border
[2029.62 --> 2031.18]  When they got up
[2031.18 --> 2031.94]  Early in the morning
[2031.94 --> 2032.88]  The sun was shining
[2032.88 --> 2033.48]  On the water
[2033.48 --> 2034.40]  To the Moabites
[2034.40 --> 2035.08]  Across the way
[2035.08 --> 2035.98]  The water looked red
[2035.98 --> 2036.60]  Like blood
[2036.60 --> 2037.76]  That's blood
[2037.76 --> 2038.40]  They said
[2038.40 --> 2039.46]  Those kings
[2039.46 --> 2040.16]  Must have fought
[2040.16 --> 2041.36]  And slaughtered each other
[2041.36 --> 2042.94]  Now to the plunder
[2042.94 --> 2043.50]  Moab
[2043.50 --> 2046.78]  But when the Moabites
[2046.78 --> 2047.76]  Came to the camp
[2047.76 --> 2048.28]  Of Israel
[2048.28 --> 2049.98]  The Israelites rose up
[2049.98 --> 2050.80]  And fought them
[2050.80 --> 2051.76]  Until they fled
[2051.76 --> 2052.64]  And the Israelites
[2052.64 --> 2053.58]  Invaded the land
[2053.58 --> 2054.88]  And slaughtered the Moabites
[2054.88 --> 2056.78]  They destroyed the towns
[2056.78 --> 2057.64]  And each man
[2057.64 --> 2058.70]  Threw a stone
[2058.70 --> 2059.92]  On every good field
[2059.92 --> 2060.96]  Until it was covered
[2060.96 --> 2062.16]  They stopped up
[2062.16 --> 2062.84]  All the springs
[2062.84 --> 2063.52]  And cut down
[2063.52 --> 2064.64]  Every good tree
[2064.64 --> 2066.72]  Only Kir Haraseth
[2066.72 --> 2067.70]  Was left
[2067.70 --> 2069.22]  With its stones in place
[2069.22 --> 2070.24]  But men
[2070.24 --> 2071.22]  Armed with slings
[2071.22 --> 2072.14]  Surrounded it
[2072.14 --> 2073.04]  And attacked it
[2073.04 --> 2075.24]  When the king of Moab
[2075.24 --> 2076.40]  Saw that the battle
[2076.40 --> 2077.58]  Had gone against him
[2077.58 --> 2078.46]  He took with him
[2078.46 --> 2079.68]  700 swordsmen
[2079.68 --> 2080.86]  To break through
[2080.86 --> 2082.20]  To the king of Edom
[2082.20 --> 2083.30]  But they failed
[2083.30 --> 2084.84]  Then he took
[2084.84 --> 2086.66]  His firstborn son
[2086.66 --> 2088.34]  Who was to succeed him
[2088.34 --> 2089.00]  As king
[2089.00 --> 2091.04]  And offered him
[2091.04 --> 2092.32]  As a sacrifice
[2092.32 --> 2094.24]  On the city wall
[2094.24 --> 2098.18]  The fury against Israel
[2098.18 --> 2099.40]  Was great
[2099.40 --> 2101.10]  They withdrew
[2101.10 --> 2102.42]  And returned
[2102.42 --> 2104.08]  To their own land
[2104.08 --> 2111.80]  In a recent article
[2111.80 --> 2113.62]  In Christianity Today
[2113.62 --> 2115.52]  They shared the story
[2115.52 --> 2116.72]  Of a church
[2116.72 --> 2118.36]  In France
[2118.36 --> 2119.58]  A mega church there
[2119.58 --> 2122.88]  Evangelical Pentecostal background
[2122.88 --> 2125.46]  Back last year
[2125.46 --> 2126.24]  In February
[2126.24 --> 2129.08]  As this pandemic
[2129.08 --> 2130.38]  Was just beginning
[2130.38 --> 2131.64]  But not really
[2131.64 --> 2132.94]  Declared yet a pandemic
[2132.94 --> 2135.14]  But was just breaking out
[2135.14 --> 2137.30]  This church held
[2137.30 --> 2138.42]  Their annual
[2138.42 --> 2140.08]  Worship conference
[2140.08 --> 2142.88]  And it was a
[2142.88 --> 2144.20]  Four day conference
[2144.20 --> 2145.64]  People came from
[2145.64 --> 2146.88]  Across Europe
[2146.88 --> 2148.48]  And even some
[2148.48 --> 2149.82]  Came from Africa
[2149.82 --> 2151.84]  And South America
[2151.84 --> 2153.82]  To attend this conference
[2153.82 --> 2155.62]  Some 2200 people
[2155.62 --> 2156.38]  Attended
[2156.38 --> 2158.74]  It was
[2158.74 --> 2160.52]  According to
[2160.52 --> 2161.66]  The senior pastor
[2161.66 --> 2162.80]  It was a beautiful time
[2162.80 --> 2163.60]  A wonderful time
[2163.60 --> 2165.00]  Of ministry
[2165.00 --> 2166.68]  Of praising God
[2166.68 --> 2167.80]  Of worship together
[2167.80 --> 2169.48]  Even of prayer
[2169.48 --> 2169.98]  For people
[2169.98 --> 2171.00]  Prayer for the sick
[2171.00 --> 2172.26]  Of healings
[2172.26 --> 2175.28]  Beautiful time
[2175.28 --> 2177.00]  Except
[2177.00 --> 2178.66]  It turned into
[2178.66 --> 2179.96]  A super spreader event
[2179.96 --> 2182.12]  Following
[2182.12 --> 2184.24]  That wonderful conference
[2184.24 --> 2186.54]  At least 500 people
[2186.54 --> 2187.16]  Were infected
[2187.16 --> 2188.24]  With COVID-19
[2188.24 --> 2190.20]  82 of them
[2190.20 --> 2191.46]  Including the senior pastor
[2191.46 --> 2192.64]  Ended up in the hospital
[2192.64 --> 2194.60]  32 people died
[2194.60 --> 2197.86]  Wow
[2197.86 --> 2198.76]  How do you come to terms
[2198.76 --> 2199.06]  With that?
[2199.40 --> 2200.02]  Suddenly
[2200.02 --> 2201.06]  Something that seemed
[2201.06 --> 2202.96]  So beautiful
[2202.96 --> 2203.84]  So wonderful
[2203.84 --> 2205.68]  Such a marvelous time
[2205.68 --> 2206.94]  And then it
[2206.94 --> 2208.22]  Completely turned
[2208.22 --> 2208.54]  Into
[2208.54 --> 2209.82]  A nightmare
[2209.82 --> 2211.18]  In fact
[2211.18 --> 2212.36]  While the
[2212.36 --> 2213.28]  The congregation
[2213.28 --> 2214.16]  Many in the congregation
[2214.16 --> 2216.04]  Were self-isolating
[2216.04 --> 2217.68]  And having to
[2217.68 --> 2219.64]  Grieve even
[2219.64 --> 2220.42]  For the losses
[2220.42 --> 2221.52]  That they experienced
[2221.52 --> 2223.04]  They were also
[2223.04 --> 2224.36]  Receiving insults
[2224.36 --> 2225.08]  From the public
[2225.08 --> 2226.28]  And even
[2226.28 --> 2227.16]  Death threats
[2227.16 --> 2228.72]  For their
[2228.72 --> 2229.28]  Supposed
[2229.28 --> 2230.30]  Recklessness
[2230.30 --> 2230.82]  Even though
[2230.82 --> 2231.72]  This was weeks
[2231.72 --> 2232.66]  Before any
[2232.66 --> 2233.40]  Health restrictions
[2233.40 --> 2234.06]  Had set in
[2234.06 --> 2237.80]  Tides
[2237.80 --> 2238.80]  Tides can turn
[2238.80 --> 2240.42]  Really quickly
[2240.42 --> 2240.92]  Can't they?
[2240.96 --> 2241.48]  Now I'm not making
[2241.48 --> 2242.06]  A comparison
[2242.06 --> 2242.86]  Between the senior
[2242.86 --> 2243.72]  Pastor here
[2243.72 --> 2244.62]  And King
[2244.62 --> 2245.22]  Yehoram
[2245.22 --> 2246.08]  Or Joram
[2246.08 --> 2247.32]  Wicked King
[2247.32 --> 2247.78]  Joram
[2247.78 --> 2248.58]  Or between
[2248.58 --> 2249.24]  This church
[2249.24 --> 2249.64]  And Israel
[2249.64 --> 2250.40]  Anything like that
[2250.40 --> 2251.78]  But just that sense
[2251.78 --> 2252.40]  In which something
[2252.40 --> 2253.10]  Can be going
[2253.10 --> 2254.22]  So right
[2254.22 --> 2255.78]  And then it can
[2255.78 --> 2257.24]  Turn on a dime
[2257.24 --> 2257.80]  Seemingly
[2257.80 --> 2259.48]  And just be going
[2259.48 --> 2260.22]  Wrong
[2260.22 --> 2262.72]  And we see that
[2262.72 --> 2263.44]  In this text
[2263.44 --> 2263.72]  Right?
[2264.40 --> 2264.90]  There is
[2264.90 --> 2265.86]  Really in this text
[2265.86 --> 2266.36]  It comes
[2266.36 --> 2267.30]  It's back and forth
[2267.30 --> 2267.76]  And back and forth
[2267.76 --> 2268.42]  Sort of like
[2268.42 --> 2269.72]  COVID-19 right now
[2269.72 --> 2271.10]  We can meet
[2271.10 --> 2272.04]  And then we can meet
[2272.04 --> 2272.86]  And then we can meet
[2272.86 --> 2273.78]  And then we can't
[2273.78 --> 2274.72]  Meet together again
[2274.72 --> 2276.76]  And in this setting
[2276.76 --> 2278.70]  You see this
[2278.70 --> 2279.98]  Rollercoaster
[2279.98 --> 2282.06]  Back and forth
[2282.06 --> 2283.40]  Of how things are going
[2283.40 --> 2284.68]  For Israel
[2284.68 --> 2285.36]  And Judah
[2285.36 --> 2286.10]  Remember it's
[2286.10 --> 2287.12]  Divided at this time
[2287.12 --> 2287.62]  The northern
[2287.62 --> 2288.62]  And the southern
[2288.62 --> 2289.44]  Kingdoms
[2289.44 --> 2291.92]  And so
[2291.92 --> 2293.04]  In that light
[2293.04 --> 2293.88]  Let's look a little bit
[2293.88 --> 2294.32]  Through the story
[2294.32 --> 2294.76]  I want to work
[2294.76 --> 2295.50]  Through the story
[2295.50 --> 2296.30]  And then I want to
[2296.30 --> 2296.76]  Work sort of
[2296.76 --> 2297.58]  Backwards
[2297.58 --> 2298.18]  To try and
[2298.18 --> 2299.04]  Understand it
[2299.04 --> 2301.08]  So three kings
[2301.08 --> 2301.72]  Set out
[2301.72 --> 2303.02]  To quell
[2303.02 --> 2304.28]  The Moabite
[2304.28 --> 2305.42]  Rebellion
[2305.42 --> 2307.06]  Misha
[2307.06 --> 2308.78]  The king of Moab
[2308.78 --> 2310.18]  Has
[2310.18 --> 2310.76]  And we know
[2310.76 --> 2311.30]  About Misha
[2311.30 --> 2312.28]  There's a stone
[2312.28 --> 2312.72]  Actually
[2312.72 --> 2313.04]  From
[2313.04 --> 2314.22]  Dates from this time
[2314.22 --> 2314.58]  From the
[2314.58 --> 2316.22]  Mid 9th century
[2316.22 --> 2316.92]  B.C.
[2317.48 --> 2318.34]  Which is
[2318.34 --> 2318.82]  Is a
[2318.82 --> 2319.34]  It's
[2319.34 --> 2320.02]  Etched in there
[2320.02 --> 2320.74]  It's carved in
[2320.74 --> 2322.04]  Writings of Misha
[2322.04 --> 2322.94]  Declaring some
[2322.94 --> 2323.36]  Of what
[2323.36 --> 2324.08]  He did
[2324.08 --> 2326.46]  He revolted
[2326.46 --> 2327.08]  Against
[2327.08 --> 2328.58]  The son of Ahab
[2328.58 --> 2330.34]  And he built up
[2330.34 --> 2331.08]  Fortresses
[2331.08 --> 2332.36]  In the northern
[2332.36 --> 2334.02]  Part of Moab
[2334.02 --> 2336.24]  And then he
[2336.24 --> 2336.80]  Called
[2336.80 --> 2338.24]  And because of that
[2338.24 --> 2339.46]  He refused to give
[2339.46 --> 2340.12]  His tribute
[2340.12 --> 2340.74]  Any longer
[2340.74 --> 2342.14]  And so it was time
[2342.14 --> 2343.96]  For the Israelite
[2343.96 --> 2344.26]  King
[2344.26 --> 2345.72]  Now to
[2345.72 --> 2346.64]  Jehoram
[2346.64 --> 2347.78]  The son of
[2347.78 --> 2348.82]  Ahab
[2348.82 --> 2349.98]  To set out
[2349.98 --> 2350.26]  And
[2350.26 --> 2352.32]  Bring him
[2352.32 --> 2353.16]  Back into line
[2353.16 --> 2353.62]  Okay
[2353.62 --> 2355.72]  To once again
[2355.72 --> 2356.58]  Defeat
[2356.58 --> 2357.16]  Moab
[2357.16 --> 2358.74]  He calls
[2358.74 --> 2359.20]  On
[2359.20 --> 2360.34]  Jehoshaphat
[2360.34 --> 2361.44]  The king
[2361.44 --> 2362.10]  In Judah
[2362.10 --> 2362.90]  To the south
[2362.90 --> 2364.18]  And
[2364.18 --> 2365.12]  Along with
[2365.12 --> 2365.68]  Edom
[2365.68 --> 2366.28]  And Edom
[2366.28 --> 2366.86]  Is probably
[2366.86 --> 2367.42]  Involved mainly
[2367.42 --> 2367.92]  Because they were
[2367.92 --> 2368.98]  Just a vassal state
[2368.98 --> 2369.64]  At this time
[2369.64 --> 2370.28]  Of Judah
[2370.28 --> 2371.14]  So they're just kind of
[2371.14 --> 2371.64]  And they're going
[2371.64 --> 2372.52]  Through their land
[2372.52 --> 2374.18]  Jehoshaphat
[2374.18 --> 2375.38]  Agrees
[2375.38 --> 2376.82]  To go with him
[2376.82 --> 2378.50]  And
[2378.50 --> 2380.68]  They decide
[2380.68 --> 2381.30]  To
[2381.30 --> 2382.22]  Attack
[2382.22 --> 2382.66]  From the south
[2382.66 --> 2383.10]  If you could put
[2383.10 --> 2383.80]  That map up
[2383.80 --> 2384.44]  Sorry
[2384.44 --> 2385.06]  It's this way
[2385.06 --> 2386.18]  You could put that map
[2386.18 --> 2387.48]  I hope you can see
[2387.48 --> 2388.06]  That clearly
[2388.06 --> 2389.04]  So you see Israel
[2389.04 --> 2389.86]  Right in the center
[2389.86 --> 2390.42]  In the green
[2390.42 --> 2391.58]  And then Judah
[2391.58 --> 2392.34]  Below them
[2392.34 --> 2393.00]  And then to the
[2393.00 --> 2394.44]  To the right of Judah
[2394.44 --> 2394.92]  Is
[2394.92 --> 2396.38]  Moab
[2396.38 --> 2397.94]  Across the Dead Sea
[2397.94 --> 2399.28]  And then to the south
[2399.28 --> 2399.88]  Of Moab
[2399.88 --> 2400.60]  Is Edom
[2400.60 --> 2402.10]  Now if you can
[2402.10 --> 2403.48]  Remember what we said
[2403.48 --> 2405.12]  The northern part
[2405.12 --> 2405.84]  Of Moab
[2405.84 --> 2406.50]  Is where
[2406.50 --> 2408.88]  King Misha
[2408.88 --> 2410.22]  Had really built up
[2410.22 --> 2410.86]  His fortifications
[2410.86 --> 2411.70]  Because that's where
[2411.70 --> 2412.40]  Israel usually
[2412.40 --> 2413.08]  Attacked from
[2413.08 --> 2415.04]  So in order
[2415.04 --> 2416.28]  To kind of
[2416.28 --> 2417.80]  Sneak around that
[2417.80 --> 2419.16]  Israel
[2419.16 --> 2420.72]  Along with Judah
[2420.72 --> 2421.44]  Decided to come
[2421.44 --> 2422.22]  To the south
[2422.22 --> 2423.14]  To the south
[2423.14 --> 2423.88]  Of the Dead Sea
[2423.88 --> 2424.16]  There
[2424.16 --> 2425.14]  And to come
[2425.14 --> 2425.86]  Through Edom
[2425.86 --> 2426.34]  And to give
[2426.34 --> 2426.80]  Sort of a
[2426.80 --> 2427.88]  Surprise attack
[2427.88 --> 2428.60]  From the south
[2428.60 --> 2429.42]  Where there were
[2429.42 --> 2430.88]  Fewer fortifications
[2430.88 --> 2431.92]  So that gives you
[2431.92 --> 2432.48]  A bit of
[2432.48 --> 2433.50]  Of the geography
[2433.50 --> 2433.94]  Of what's
[2433.94 --> 2434.86]  Happening here
[2434.86 --> 2436.28]  And so
[2436.28 --> 2437.38]  As we said
[2437.38 --> 2439.46]  Jehoshaphat agrees
[2439.46 --> 2441.72]  To join in
[2441.72 --> 2442.56]  On this venture
[2442.56 --> 2443.10]  Now
[2443.10 --> 2446.08]  This chapter
[2446.08 --> 2449.26]  Will bring back
[2449.26 --> 2449.86]  Memories
[2449.86 --> 2450.94]  Of another chapter
[2450.94 --> 2451.50]  If you've been
[2451.50 --> 2452.14]  Reading through
[2452.14 --> 2452.88]  If you read
[2452.88 --> 2453.72]  Through this text
[2453.72 --> 2454.72]  With any
[2454.72 --> 2456.20]  Regularity
[2456.20 --> 2457.44]  Because back
[2457.44 --> 2457.70]  Because back in
[2457.70 --> 2458.58]  First Kings
[2458.58 --> 2459.38]  22
[2459.38 --> 2461.38]  The
[2461.38 --> 2462.88]  Once again
[2462.88 --> 2463.74]  King Ahab
[2463.74 --> 2464.38]  This time
[2464.38 --> 2466.12]  Called on
[2466.12 --> 2467.48]  Jehoshaphat
[2467.48 --> 2468.66]  The king
[2468.66 --> 2469.04]  In Judah
[2469.04 --> 2469.94]  To come and
[2469.94 --> 2470.72]  Help him
[2470.72 --> 2471.74]  Fight against
[2471.74 --> 2473.06]  Ramoth Gilead
[2473.06 --> 2473.72]  Do you remember
[2473.72 --> 2474.26]  That story?
[2474.72 --> 2475.62]  And some of
[2475.62 --> 2476.16]  The verses
[2476.16 --> 2477.16]  Are exactly
[2477.16 --> 2477.80]  The same
[2477.80 --> 2478.86]  In verse 7
[2478.86 --> 2479.96]  Here in our text
[2479.96 --> 2481.92]  Where
[2481.92 --> 2482.80]  When he calls
[2482.80 --> 2483.44]  On Jehoshaphat
[2483.44 --> 2483.96]  Jehoshaphat
[2483.96 --> 2484.38]  Says I will
[2484.38 --> 2484.80]  Go with you
[2484.80 --> 2485.86]  I am as you
[2485.86 --> 2486.10]  Are
[2486.10 --> 2486.88]  My people
[2486.88 --> 2487.58]  As your people
[2487.58 --> 2488.42]  My horses
[2488.42 --> 2489.20]  As your horses
[2489.20 --> 2489.86]  He said the
[2489.86 --> 2490.68]  Exact same thing
[2490.68 --> 2491.32]  To king Ahab
[2491.32 --> 2491.92]  Back in
[2491.92 --> 2492.36]  First Kings
[2492.36 --> 2493.08]  22
[2493.08 --> 2495.14]  And then
[2495.14 --> 2495.80]  When they're
[2495.80 --> 2496.22]  Wondering
[2496.22 --> 2496.94]  Whether they
[2496.94 --> 2497.36]  Should go
[2497.36 --> 2497.80]  Or not
[2497.80 --> 2498.84]  It's
[2498.84 --> 2499.92]  Jehoshaphat
[2499.92 --> 2500.26]  Again
[2500.26 --> 2501.66]  Who says
[2501.66 --> 2502.38]  Is there
[2502.38 --> 2502.92]  A prophet
[2502.92 --> 2503.58]  Of the lord
[2503.58 --> 2503.92]  Here?
[2504.34 --> 2504.70]  Now at that
[2504.70 --> 2505.26]  Point he calls
[2505.26 --> 2505.88]  On Micaiah
[2505.88 --> 2506.66]  Another prophet
[2506.66 --> 2507.38]  Here it's
[2507.38 --> 2507.84]  Elisha
[2507.84 --> 2508.58]  But he makes
[2508.58 --> 2509.04]  The same
[2509.04 --> 2509.38]  Reference
[2509.38 --> 2510.00]  So it's
[2510.00 --> 2510.82]  Almost the
[2510.82 --> 2511.86]  Same story
[2511.86 --> 2512.56]  A very
[2512.56 --> 2513.42]  Similar kind
[2513.42 --> 2514.80]  Of a narrative
[2514.80 --> 2515.46]  Going on
[2515.46 --> 2515.72]  Here
[2515.72 --> 2518.24]  So Jehoshaphat
[2518.24 --> 2518.96]  Agrees to go
[2518.96 --> 2519.42]  With him
[2519.42 --> 2520.72]  With the king
[2520.72 --> 2521.30]  Of Israel
[2521.30 --> 2522.24]  Jehoram
[2522.24 --> 2523.14]  They head
[2523.14 --> 2523.54]  Out
[2523.54 --> 2526.92]  What could
[2526.92 --> 2527.50]  Go wrong?
[2529.12 --> 2530.22]  Three kings
[2530.22 --> 2531.14]  Against one
[2531.14 --> 2532.88]  A surprise
[2532.88 --> 2533.58]  Attack from
[2533.58 --> 2534.22]  The south
[2534.22 --> 2535.92]  Everything's
[2535.92 --> 2536.70]  Going great
[2536.70 --> 2537.06]  Right?
[2537.38 --> 2539.18]  And then
[2539.18 --> 2539.58]  The tide
[2539.58 --> 2540.06]  Turns
[2540.06 --> 2542.82]  Because
[2542.82 --> 2543.72]  The desert
[2543.72 --> 2544.24]  Is a pretty
[2544.24 --> 2544.76]  Unforgiving
[2544.76 --> 2545.26]  Environment
[2545.26 --> 2547.08]  And they're
[2547.08 --> 2547.78]  They start
[2547.78 --> 2548.40]  To maybe
[2548.40 --> 2548.88]  Get lost
[2548.88 --> 2549.20]  On their
[2549.20 --> 2549.60]  Way a bit
[2549.60 --> 2549.92]  They don't
[2549.92 --> 2550.24]  Exactly
[2550.24 --> 2550.48]  They're
[2550.48 --> 2551.04]  Wandering
[2551.04 --> 2551.50]  Through the
[2551.50 --> 2551.92]  Desert
[2551.92 --> 2552.94]  And
[2552.94 --> 2554.78]  Seven days
[2554.78 --> 2555.18]  Later
[2555.18 --> 2556.26]  They're
[2556.26 --> 2556.52]  Out of
[2556.52 --> 2556.84]  Water
[2556.84 --> 2559.08]  And suddenly
[2559.08 --> 2559.66]  Instead of
[2559.66 --> 2560.12]  Having this
[2560.12 --> 2560.50]  Sense of
[2560.50 --> 2561.32]  Exuberance
[2561.32 --> 2561.88]  That we're
[2561.88 --> 2562.12]  Going to
[2562.12 --> 2562.48]  Go and
[2562.48 --> 2562.70]  Put
[2562.70 --> 2563.60]  Moab
[2563.60 --> 2563.88]  In their
[2563.88 --> 2564.40]  Place
[2564.40 --> 2565.18]  They're
[2565.18 --> 2565.36]  Now
[2565.36 --> 2565.70]  Going
[2565.70 --> 2566.54]  We're
[2566.54 --> 2566.70]  Going to
[2566.70 --> 2567.10]  Die
[2567.10 --> 2567.88]  Moab
[2567.88 --> 2568.08]  Is going
[2568.08 --> 2568.42]  To attack
[2568.42 --> 2568.60]  Us
[2568.60 --> 2568.94]  And we're
[2568.94 --> 2569.42]  We're
[2569.42 --> 2569.88]  Thirsty
[2569.88 --> 2570.14]  We're
[2570.14 --> 2570.42]  Dying
[2570.42 --> 2570.94]  Of thirst
[2570.94 --> 2571.28]  Here
[2571.28 --> 2572.60]  How could
[2572.60 --> 2572.80]  This
[2572.80 --> 2573.56]  Possibly
[2573.56 --> 2573.98]  Happen
[2573.98 --> 2574.68]  How could
[2574.68 --> 2575.32]  God
[2575.32 --> 2576.16]  Lead us
[2576.16 --> 2576.60]  Into a
[2576.60 --> 2577.08]  Situation
[2577.08 --> 2577.76]  Like this
[2577.76 --> 2580.08]  Now there
[2580.08 --> 2580.68]  Are also
[2580.68 --> 2581.40]  Echoes
[2581.40 --> 2581.78]  Here
[2581.78 --> 2583.92]  Of
[2583.92 --> 2583.94]  Of
[2583.94 --> 2583.96]  Of
[2583.96 --> 2583.98]  Of
[2583.98 --> 2584.42]  Of
[2584.42 --> 2584.46]  Of
[2584.46 --> 2584.78]  Of
[2584.78 --> 2585.98]  Of
[2585.98 --> 2586.54]  Do you
[2586.54 --> 2586.80]  Remember
[2586.80 --> 2587.22]  In the
[2587.22 --> 2587.66]  Exodus
[2587.66 --> 2589.00]  When the
[2589.00 --> 2589.40]  People of
[2589.40 --> 2589.80]  Israel
[2589.80 --> 2590.36]  They're
[2590.36 --> 2590.66]  In the
[2590.66 --> 2591.06]  Desert
[2591.06 --> 2592.18]  They have
[2592.18 --> 2592.78]  Those wandering
[2592.78 --> 2593.40]  Times and
[2593.40 --> 2594.20]  Particularly early
[2594.20 --> 2594.64]  On in
[2594.64 --> 2595.64]  Exodus 16
[2595.64 --> 2596.34]  And 17
[2596.34 --> 2597.64]  Similar
[2597.64 --> 2598.10]  Kind of
[2598.10 --> 2598.72]  Language is
[2598.72 --> 2599.16]  Used
[2599.16 --> 2599.90]  They're
[2599.90 --> 2600.50]  Wandering in
[2600.50 --> 2600.92]  The desert
[2600.92 --> 2601.56]  There's
[2601.56 --> 2601.88]  No
[2601.88 --> 2602.52]  Water
[2602.52 --> 2603.86]  Lord
[2603.86 --> 2605.56]  Why did
[2605.56 --> 2605.90]  You lead
[2605.90 --> 2606.10]  Us
[2606.10 --> 2606.66]  Moses
[2606.66 --> 2607.84]  Why did
[2607.84 --> 2608.16]  You lead
[2608.16 --> 2608.56]  Us away
[2608.56 --> 2608.80]  From
[2608.80 --> 2609.30]  Egypt
[2609.30 --> 2609.68]  We could
[2609.68 --> 2609.92]  Have been
[2609.92 --> 2610.54]  Safe there
[2610.54 --> 2610.80]  And at
[2610.80 --> 2611.26]  Least had
[2611.26 --> 2611.66]  Enough to
[2611.66 --> 2612.10]  Eat and
[2612.10 --> 2612.44]  Drink
[2612.44 --> 2613.30]  And now
[2613.30 --> 2613.56]  We're
[2613.56 --> 2613.96]  We're
[2613.96 --> 2614.58]  Dying of
[2614.58 --> 2614.94]  Thirst
[2614.94 --> 2615.24]  Here
[2615.24 --> 2616.40]  Similar
[2616.40 --> 2617.02]  Kinds
[2617.02 --> 2617.20]  Of
[2617.20 --> 2618.02]  Language
[2618.02 --> 2619.00]  Once again
[2619.00 --> 2619.26]  Now
[2619.26 --> 2619.52]  They're
[2619.52 --> 2620.40]  Wandering in
[2620.40 --> 2620.92]  The desert
[2620.92 --> 2621.82]  And no
[2621.82 --> 2622.26]  Water
[2622.26 --> 2623.62]  And
[2623.62 --> 2624.42]  Jehoram
[2624.42 --> 2624.82]  Has the
[2624.82 --> 2625.06]  Gall
[2625.06 --> 2626.42]  To blame
[2626.42 --> 2626.90]  The
[2626.90 --> 2627.38]  Lord
[2627.38 --> 2628.20]  For it
[2628.20 --> 2630.42]  He
[2630.42 --> 2631.02]  Led us
[2631.02 --> 2631.24]  Here
[2631.24 --> 2631.72]  There's
[2631.72 --> 2631.96]  Actually
[2631.96 --> 2632.78]  No indication
[2632.78 --> 2633.08]  In the
[2633.08 --> 2633.50]  Text at
[2633.50 --> 2633.66]  All
[2633.66 --> 2634.16]  That the
[2634.16 --> 2634.34]  Lord
[2634.34 --> 2634.56]  Led
[2634.56 --> 2634.74]  Them
[2634.74 --> 2635.44]  To do
[2635.44 --> 2635.72]  This
[2635.72 --> 2636.92]  But he
[2636.92 --> 2637.32]  Blames
[2637.32 --> 2638.22]  Yahweh
[2638.22 --> 2640.82]  Well
[2640.82 --> 2641.10]  God
[2641.10 --> 2641.94]  Responds
[2641.94 --> 2642.56]  Through
[2642.56 --> 2643.26]  The prophet
[2643.26 --> 2643.78]  Elisha
[2643.78 --> 2644.34]  And this
[2644.34 --> 2644.62]  Is the
[2644.62 --> 2645.26]  First time
[2645.26 --> 2645.52]  Really
[2645.52 --> 2646.10]  Elisha
[2646.10 --> 2646.68]  Certainly
[2646.68 --> 2646.98]  In this
[2646.98 --> 2647.24]  Chapter
[2647.24 --> 2647.52]  It's the
[2647.52 --> 2647.84]  First time
[2647.84 --> 2648.00]  He's
[2648.00 --> 2648.40]  Introduced
[2648.40 --> 2648.66]  On the
[2648.66 --> 2648.86]  Scene
[2648.86 --> 2649.36]  And
[2649.36 --> 2649.98]  Elisha
[2649.98 --> 2650.46]  Apparently
[2650.46 --> 2651.30]  Is not
[2651.30 --> 2651.60]  Yet
[2651.60 --> 2652.10]  Really
[2652.10 --> 2652.54]  Known
[2652.54 --> 2653.04]  On the
[2653.04 --> 2653.58]  Political
[2653.58 --> 2654.54]  Scene
[2654.54 --> 2655.14]  Yet
[2655.14 --> 2655.94]  Elijah
[2655.94 --> 2656.34]  Had
[2656.34 --> 2656.58]  Been
[2656.58 --> 2656.78]  He
[2656.78 --> 2656.92]  Had
[2656.92 --> 2658.02]  Confrontations
[2658.02 --> 2658.22]  With
[2658.22 --> 2658.84]  Ahab
[2658.84 --> 2659.14]  And so
[2659.14 --> 2659.26]  They
[2659.26 --> 2659.46]  All
[2659.46 --> 2659.66]  Knew
[2659.66 --> 2659.94]  Him
[2659.94 --> 2660.50]  But
[2660.50 --> 2661.18]  Elisha
[2661.18 --> 2661.54]  Is a
[2661.54 --> 2662.06]  Relative
[2662.06 --> 2662.98]  Newcomer
[2662.98 --> 2664.34]  So
[2664.34 --> 2664.92]  And we
[2664.92 --> 2665.04]  Don't
[2665.04 --> 2665.18]  Even
[2665.18 --> 2665.36]  Know
[2665.36 --> 2665.78]  Why
[2665.78 --> 2666.10]  He's
[2666.10 --> 2666.38]  Here
[2666.38 --> 2666.60]  Or
[2666.60 --> 2666.82]  How
[2666.82 --> 2667.20]  Where
[2667.20 --> 2667.68]  Exactly
[2667.68 --> 2667.94]  He
[2667.94 --> 2668.12]  Is
[2668.12 --> 2668.30]  How
[2668.30 --> 2668.46]  He
[2668.46 --> 2668.64]  Gets
[2668.64 --> 2669.02]  Involved
[2669.02 --> 2669.12]  In
[2669.12 --> 2669.24]  This
[2669.24 --> 2669.78]  But
[2669.78 --> 2670.30]  He's
[2670.30 --> 2670.72]  There
[2670.72 --> 2671.46]  And so
[2671.46 --> 2671.64]  They
[2671.64 --> 2672.02]  Go
[2672.02 --> 2672.54]  To
[2672.54 --> 2673.14]  Find
[2673.14 --> 2674.36]  Elisha
[2674.36 --> 2674.88]  The prophet
[2674.88 --> 2675.82]  And
[2675.82 --> 2676.50]  Elisha
[2676.50 --> 2677.10]  The prophet
[2677.10 --> 2678.40]  He's
[2678.40 --> 2679.42]  Incredibly
[2679.42 --> 2680.04]  Rude
[2680.04 --> 2680.40]  To
[2680.40 --> 2680.68]  King
[2680.68 --> 2681.38]  Did
[2681.38 --> 2681.46]  You
[2681.46 --> 2681.66]  Catch
[2681.66 --> 2681.96]  That

[2684.58 --> 2684.76]  Of
[2684.76 --> 2684.92]  Your

[2688.82 --> 2689.02]  With
[2689.02 --> 2689.16]  You
[2689.16 --> 2689.54]  Why
[2689.54 --> 2689.72]  Are
[2689.72 --> 2689.92]  You
[2689.92 --> 2690.72]  Involving
[2690.72 --> 2691.12]  Me
[2691.12 --> 2692.56]  He
[2692.56 --> 2693.10]  Shows
[2693.10 --> 2693.34]  His

[2698.66 --> 2698.92]  Yehor
[2698.92 --> 2700.90]  But
[2700.90 --> 2701.54]  Ultimately
[2701.54 --> 2702.24]  He does
[2702.24 --> 2702.88]  Listen
[2702.88 --> 2703.70]  Why
[2703.70 --> 2705.44]  Because

[2717.20 --> 2717.64]  Prophecy
[2717.64 --> 2717.88]  Really
[2717.88 --> 2718.06]  A

[2726.74 --> 2726.94]  Too
[2726.94 --> 2727.38]  Easy

[2729.12 --> 2729.36]  Easy
[2729.36 --> 2729.80]  Sort
[2729.80 --> 2729.90]  Of

[2738.14 --> 2738.46]  Says
[2738.46 --> 2738.60]  And
[2738.60 --> 2738.82]  Now

[3176.06 --> 3177.34]  They
[3177.34 --> 3177.80]  Just
[3177.80 --> 3178.38]  Break
[3178.38 --> 3178.72]  Camp
[3178.72 --> 3178.90]  And
[3178.90 --> 3179.12]  Leave
[3179.12 --> 3179.32]  They
[3179.32 --> 3179.58]  Just
[3179.58 --> 3180.10]  Can't
[3180.10 --> 3181.08]  Tolerate
[3181.08 --> 3181.28]  It
[3181.28 --> 3183.14]  That's
[3183.14 --> 3183.58]  Probably
[3183.58 --> 3183.86]  The
[3183.86 --> 3184.22]  Theory
[3184.22 --> 3184.48]  Of
[3184.48 --> 3185.08]  More
[3185.08 --> 3185.96]  Many
[3185.96 --> 3186.12]  Of
[3186.12 --> 3186.22]  The
[3186.22 --> 3186.42]  More
[3186.42 --> 3187.54]  Conservative
[3187.54 --> 3188.74]  Commentators
[3188.74 --> 3189.02]  On
[3189.02 --> 3189.16]  This
[3189.16 --> 3189.48]  Text
[3189.48 --> 3192.12]  The
[3192.12 --> 3192.46]  Third
[3192.46 --> 3192.84]  Theory
[3192.84 --> 3193.22]  Is
[3193.22 --> 3193.74]  That
[3193.74 --> 3193.98]  It's
[3193.98 --> 3194.56]  Great
[3194.56 --> 3195.20]  Wrath
[3195.20 --> 3195.42]  But
[3195.42 --> 3195.68]  It's
[3195.68 --> 3196.52]  Divine
[3196.52 --> 3197.58]  Wrath
[3197.58 --> 3198.48]  And
[3198.48 --> 3198.62]  In
[3198.62 --> 3198.88]  This
[3198.88 --> 3199.34]  Case
[3199.34 --> 3200.00]  Maybe
[3200.00 --> 3200.76]  It's
[3200.76 --> 3201.12]  The
[3201.12 --> 3201.54]  Wrath
[3201.54 --> 3202.02]  Of
[3202.02 --> 3203.14]  The
[3203.14 --> 3203.50]  God
[3203.50 --> 3204.36]  Chemosh
[3204.36 --> 3205.14]  Of
[3205.14 --> 3205.26]  The
[3205.26 --> 3205.80]  Moabites
[3205.80 --> 3207.02]  Because
[3207.02 --> 3207.20]  They
[3207.20 --> 3207.36]  Were
[3207.36 --> 3208.10]  Sacrificing
[3208.10 --> 3208.32]  To
[3208.32 --> 3208.88]  Chemosh
[3208.88 --> 3209.60]  And
[3209.60 --> 3210.24]  He's
[3210.24 --> 3210.80]  Hit
[3210.80 --> 3211.12]  It's
[3211.12 --> 3211.30]  The
[3211.30 --> 3212.12]  Son's
[3212.12 --> 3212.64]  King's
[3212.64 --> 3212.88]  Son
[3212.88 --> 3213.14]  Is
[3213.14 --> 3214.00]  Sacrificed
[3214.00 --> 3214.14]  A
[3214.14 --> 3214.40]  Human
[3214.40 --> 3214.98]  Sacrificed
[3214.98 --> 3215.12]  To
[3215.12 --> 3215.26]  The
[3215.26 --> 3215.54]  God
[3215.54 --> 3215.70]  To
[3215.70 --> 3215.80]  The
[3215.80 --> 3215.96]  God
[3215.96 --> 3216.04]  Of
[3216.04 --> 3216.12]  The
[3216.12 --> 3216.42]  Moabites
[3216.42 --> 3216.80]  Chemosh
[3216.80 --> 3217.40]  And
[3217.40 --> 3217.64]  In
[3217.64 --> 3218.26]  Response
[3218.26 --> 3218.80]  He
[3218.80 --> 3219.40]  Makes
[3219.40 --> 3219.66]  This
[3219.66 --> 3220.28]  Attack
[3220.28 --> 3220.86]  But
[3220.86 --> 3221.10]  That's
[3221.10 --> 3221.30]  Really
[3221.30 --> 3221.54]  Hard
[3221.54 --> 3221.70]  To
[3221.70 --> 3222.02]  Fathom
[3222.02 --> 3222.22]  Isn't
[3222.22 --> 3222.44]  It
[3222.44 --> 3223.20]  I
[3223.20 --> 3223.40]  Mean
[3223.40 --> 3223.60]  The
[3223.60 --> 3223.78]  Old
[3223.78 --> 3224.18]  Testament
[3224.18 --> 3224.52]  Never
[3224.52 --> 3224.76]  Gives
[3224.76 --> 3224.98]  Any
[3224.98 --> 3225.50]  Any
[3225.50 --> 3226.40]  Creedence
[3226.40 --> 3226.60]  To
[3226.60 --> 3226.90]  These
[3226.90 --> 3227.26]  Gods
[3227.26 --> 3227.50]  They're
[3227.50 --> 3228.36]  Nothings
[3228.36 --> 3229.50]  How
[3229.50 --> 3229.52]  How
[3229.52 --> 3229.54]  How
[3229.54 --> 3229.56]  How
[3229.56 --> 3229.64]  To
[3229.64 --> 3230.06]  Nothing
[3230.06 --> 3230.74]  God
[3230.74 --> 3232.58]  Accomplish
[3232.58 --> 3232.84]  Something
[3232.84 --> 3233.08]  Like
[3233.08 --> 3233.40]  That
[3233.40 --> 3235.00]  And
[3235.00 --> 3235.18]  So
[3235.18 --> 3235.40]  The
[3235.40 --> 3235.82]  Fourth
[3235.82 --> 3236.42]  Theory
[3236.42 --> 3237.34]  Is
[3237.34 --> 3237.56]  That
[3237.56 --> 3237.72]  It
[3237.72 --> 3238.10]  Actually
[3238.10 --> 3238.66]  Is
[3238.66 --> 3240.14]  Yahweh's
[3240.14 --> 3240.74]  Wrath
[3240.74 --> 3241.46]  The
[3241.46 --> 3242.12]  Lord's
[3242.12 --> 3242.54]  Divine
[3242.54 --> 3242.78]  Wrath
[3242.78 --> 3242.94]  But
[3242.94 --> 3243.12]  It's
[3243.12 --> 3243.46]  The
[3243.46 --> 3243.76]  Lord
[3243.76 --> 3244.50]  God's
[3244.50 --> 3245.20]  Wrath
[3245.20 --> 3246.60]  That
[3246.60 --> 3247.00]  Rises
[3247.00 --> 3247.34]  Up
[3247.34 --> 3248.00]  Somehow
[3248.00 --> 3248.64]  Upon
[3248.64 --> 3249.30]  Against
[3249.30 --> 3250.18]  Israel
[3250.18 --> 3250.80]  Now
[3250.80 --> 3251.34]  A
[3251.34 --> 3251.54]  Lot
[3251.54 --> 3251.68]  Of
[3251.68 --> 3251.94]  People
[3251.94 --> 3253.46]  Oppose
[3253.46 --> 3253.72]  That
[3253.72 --> 3254.00]  Because
[3254.00 --> 3254.20]  They
[3254.20 --> 3254.36]  Say
[3254.36 --> 3254.54]  Well
[3254.54 --> 3254.76]  Why
[3254.76 --> 3254.96]  Would
[3254.96 --> 3255.32]  God
[3255.32 --> 3255.82]  Respond
[3255.82 --> 3256.04]  To
[3256.04 --> 3256.16]  A
[3256.16 --> 3256.36]  Human
[3256.36 --> 3257.16]  Sacrifice
[3257.16 --> 3258.14]  But
[3258.14 --> 3258.58]  It's
[3258.58 --> 3258.74]  Not
[3258.74 --> 3259.28]  Necessarily
[3259.28 --> 3259.50]  That
[3259.50 --> 3259.68]  He
[3259.68 --> 3260.08]  Is
[3260.08 --> 3260.54]  I
[3260.54 --> 3260.70]  Would
[3260.70 --> 3261.00]  Argue
[3261.00 --> 3261.46]  And
[3261.46 --> 3261.86]  I
[3261.86 --> 3262.22]  Tend
[3262.22 --> 3262.40]  To
[3262.40 --> 3262.74]  Think
[3262.74 --> 3263.70]  That
[3263.70 --> 3264.32]  What
[3264.32 --> 3264.46]  The
[3264.46 --> 3264.66]  Text
[3264.66 --> 3264.94]  Really
[3264.94 --> 3265.12]  Is
[3265.12 --> 3265.34]  Leading
[3265.34 --> 3265.66]  Towards
[3265.66 --> 3265.88]  Is
[3265.88 --> 3266.06]  That
[3266.06 --> 3266.20]  It
[3266.20 --> 3266.38]  Is
[3266.38 --> 3266.52]  A
[3266.52 --> 3266.76]  Sort
[3266.76 --> 3266.88]  Of
[3266.88 --> 3267.70]  God's
[3267.70 --> 3268.12]  Divine
[3268.12 --> 3268.66]  Wrath
[3268.66 --> 3271.62]  That
[3271.62 --> 3272.26]  God
[3272.26 --> 3272.84]  Is
[3272.84 --> 3274.10]  Turning
[3274.10 --> 3274.36]  The
[3274.36 --> 3274.82]  Tide
[3274.82 --> 3275.64]  Against
[3275.64 --> 3276.30]  His
[3276.30 --> 3276.72]  People
[3276.72 --> 3278.70]  The
[3278.70 --> 3279.00]  Use
[3279.00 --> 3279.18]  Of
[3279.18 --> 3279.38]  This
[3279.38 --> 3279.82]  Term
[3279.82 --> 3280.34]  Great
[3280.34 --> 3280.86]  Wrath
[3280.86 --> 3281.98]  Comes
[3281.98 --> 3282.16]  Up
[3282.16 --> 3282.72]  Five
[3282.72 --> 3283.14]  Other
[3283.14 --> 3283.64]  Times
[3283.64 --> 3284.00]  In
[3284.00 --> 3284.08]  The
[3284.08 --> 3284.24]  Old
[3284.24 --> 3284.58]  Testament
[3284.58 --> 3286.02]  And
[3286.02 --> 3286.84]  Every
[3286.84 --> 3287.34]  Other
[3287.34 --> 3287.96]  Time
[3287.96 --> 3288.72]  It
[3288.72 --> 3289.26]  Refers
[3289.26 --> 3289.88]  To
[3289.88 --> 3290.50]  Yahweh's
[3290.50 --> 3290.84]  Wrath
[3290.84 --> 3293.18]  Four
[3293.18 --> 3293.36]  Of
[3293.36 --> 3293.46]  The
[3293.46 --> 3293.86]  Times
[3293.86 --> 3294.16]  It's
[3294.16 --> 3294.32]  His
[3294.32 --> 3294.60]  Wrath
[3294.60 --> 3294.94]  Against
[3294.94 --> 3295.46]  Israel
[3295.46 --> 3296.58]  One
[3296.58 --> 3296.92]  Time
[3296.92 --> 3297.24]  It's
[3297.24 --> 3297.40]  His
[3297.40 --> 3297.74]  Wrath
[3297.74 --> 3298.26]  Against
[3298.26 --> 3298.76]  The
[3298.76 --> 3299.14]  Nations
[3299.14 --> 3300.24]  But
[3300.24 --> 3300.64]  Every
[3300.64 --> 3300.84]  Other
[3300.84 --> 3301.20]  Time
[3301.20 --> 3302.26]  Great
[3302.26 --> 3302.94]  Wrath
[3302.94 --> 3304.26]  Is
[3304.26 --> 3304.64]  God's
[3304.64 --> 3304.90]  Wrath
[3304.90 --> 3305.26]  Against
[3305.26 --> 3305.68]  Is
[3305.68 --> 3306.08]  God's
[3306.08 --> 3306.36]  Wrath
[3306.36 --> 3306.70]  The
[3306.70 --> 3306.90]  Lord
[3306.90 --> 3307.24]  God
[3307.24 --> 3308.36]  Now
[3308.36 --> 3309.08]  Admittedly
[3309.08 --> 3309.24]  It
[3309.24 --> 3309.72]  Doesn't
[3309.72 --> 3310.44]  Specify
[3310.44 --> 3310.64]  It
[3310.64 --> 3310.78]  Here
[3310.78 --> 3310.96]  So
[3310.96 --> 3311.10]  It
[3311.10 --> 3311.46]  Could
[3311.46 --> 3311.66]  Be
[3311.66 --> 3311.86]  The
[3311.86 --> 3312.38]  Exception
[3312.38 --> 3313.28]  But
[3313.28 --> 3313.80]  I
[3313.80 --> 3314.62]  Still
[3314.62 --> 3314.90]  Tend
[3314.90 --> 3315.04]  To
[3315.04 --> 3315.22]  Think
[3315.22 --> 3315.40]  In
[3315.40 --> 3315.78]  Some
[3315.78 --> 3316.08]  Way
[3316.08 --> 3317.14]  God's
[3317.14 --> 3317.60]  Wrath
[3317.60 --> 3318.06]  And
[3318.06 --> 3318.28]  Maybe
[3318.28 --> 3318.98]  In
[3318.98 --> 3319.58]  Himself
[3319.58 --> 3319.94]  Also
[3319.94 --> 3320.56]  Disgusted
[3320.56 --> 3320.78]  With
[3320.78 --> 3320.88]  The
[3320.88 --> 3321.08]  Human
[3321.08 --> 3321.62]  Sacrifice
[3321.62 --> 3321.78]  We
[3321.78 --> 3321.96]  Don't
[3321.96 --> 3322.22]  Know
[3322.22 --> 3323.42]  Certainly
[3323.42 --> 3323.62]  He
[3323.62 --> 3324.04]  Was
[3324.04 --> 3324.36]  He
[3324.36 --> 3324.54]  Makes
[3324.54 --> 3324.72]  He
[3324.72 --> 3325.42]  Makes
[3325.42 --> 3325.58]  That
[3325.58 --> 3325.88]  Clear
[3325.88 --> 3326.34]  In
[3326.34 --> 3327.26]  Other
[3327.26 --> 3327.86]  Scriptures
[3327.86 --> 3329.06]  But
[3329.06 --> 3329.44]  Great
[3329.44 --> 3330.02]  Wrath
[3330.02 --> 3330.74]  From
[3330.74 --> 3330.90]  The
[3330.90 --> 3331.12]  Lord
[3331.12 --> 3331.80]  Why
[3331.80 --> 3332.10]  Why
[3332.10 --> 3332.26]  Would
[3332.26 --> 3332.34]  He
[3332.34 --> 3332.44]  Be
[3332.44 --> 3332.60]  So
[3332.60 --> 3332.88]  Mad
[3332.88 --> 3333.20]  Why
[3333.20 --> 3333.40]  Would
[3333.40 --> 3333.48]  He
[3333.48 --> 3333.76]  Rise
[3333.76 --> 3333.96]  Up
[3333.96 --> 3334.90]  Suddenly
[3334.90 --> 3336.32]  Seemingly
[3336.32 --> 3336.90]  And
[3336.90 --> 3337.26]  Turn
[3337.26 --> 3337.76]  Against
[3337.76 --> 3338.16]  Israel
[3338.16 --> 3339.12]  Well
[3339.12 --> 3339.26]  I
[3339.26 --> 3339.48]  Think
[3339.48 --> 3339.86]  If
[3339.86 --> 3339.96]  We
[3339.96 --> 3340.16]  Work
[3340.16 --> 3340.82]  Backwards
[3340.82 --> 3341.50]  Briefly
[3341.50 --> 3342.74]  Some
[3342.74 --> 3343.06]  Hints
[3343.06 --> 3343.32]  Come
[3343.32 --> 3343.50]  Up
[3343.50 --> 3343.68]  In
[3343.68 --> 3343.80]  The
[3343.80 --> 3344.16]  Text
[3344.16 --> 3345.34]  If
[3345.34 --> 3345.44]  You
[3345.44 --> 3345.60]  Go
[3345.60 --> 3345.90]  Back
[3345.90 --> 3346.32]  Again

[3926.32 --> 3926.98]  This
[3926.98 --> 3927.32]  Word
[3927.32 --> 3927.50]  And

[3938.68 --> 3939.00]  Own
[3939.00 --> 3939.84]  Rebellion
[3939.84 --> 3941.12]  And
[3941.12 --> 3941.30]  Our
[3941.30 --> 3941.96]  Desperate
[3941.96 --> 3942.36]  Need
[3942.36 --> 3943.12]  For

[3945.64 --> 3945.86]  Our
[3945.86 --> 3946.42]  Prayers
[3946.42 --> 3948.60]  And
[3948.60 --> 3948.74]  We
[3948.74 --> 3949.18]  Thank
[3949.18 --> 3949.50]  You
[3949.50 --> 3950.00]  And
[3950.00 --> 3950.50]  Praise
[3950.50 --> 3950.76]  You

[3951.92 --> 3952.06]  The
[3952.06 --> 3952.52]  Gift
[3952.52 --> 3953.96]  Of

[3954.18 --> 3954.74]  Son
[3954.74 --> 3956.34]  That
[3956.34 --> 3956.78]  Ultimate
[3956.78 --> 3957.12]  Son
[3957.12 --> 3957.26]  Of
[3957.26 --> 3957.60]  David
[3957.60 --> 3959.00]  Jesus
[3959.00 --> 3959.60]  Christ
[3959.60 --> 3961.52]  Who
[3961.52 --> 3962.08]  Makes
[3962.08 --> 3963.54]  Salvation
[3963.54 --> 3965.20]  Deliverance
[3965.20 --> 3966.58]  Redemption
[3966.58 --> 3967.84]  A
[3967.84 --> 3968.52]  Reality
[3968.52 --> 3969.70]  For
[3969.70 --> 3969.96]  His
[3969.96 --> 3970.34]  People
[3970.34 --> 3972.04]  Lord
[3972.04 --> 3972.28]  Hear
[3972.28 --> 3972.50]  Our
[3972.50 --> 3973.08]  Prayers
[3973.08 --> 3974.96]  Hear
[3974.96 --> 3975.12]  Our
[3975.12 --> 3975.40]  Prayers
[3975.40 --> 3975.54]  On
[3975.54 --> 3975.88]  Behalf
[3975.88 --> 3976.00]  Of
[3976.00 --> 3976.18]  This
[3976.18 --> 3976.56]  World
[3976.56 --> 3978.02]  For
[3978.02 --> 3978.30]  Your
[3978.30 --> 3978.96]  Salvation
[3978.96 --> 3979.76]  To
[3979.76 --> 3980.14]  Spread
[3980.14 --> 3980.34]  To
[3980.34 --> 3980.52]  The
[3980.52 --> 3980.90]  Ends
[3980.90 --> 3981.02]  Of
[3981.02 --> 3981.16]  The
[3981.16 --> 3981.44]  Earth
[3981.44 --> 3982.56]  We
[3982.56 --> 3982.80]  Pray
[3982.80 --> 3983.00]  In
[3983.00 --> 3983.26]  Jesus
[3983.26 --> 3983.64]  Name
[3983.64 --> 3984.54]  Amen
[3984.54 --> 3984.74]  Amen
[4014.54 --> 4025.54]  of loudest praise. Teach me some, the Lord is sonnet, send my flaming tongues above.
[4025.54 --> 4035.54]  Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it, bow down God's redeeming love.
[4035.54 --> 4050.54]  Here I find my greatest treasure, hither by thy help I come, and I hope by thy good pleasure,
[4050.54 --> 4063.54]  safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the fold of God,
[4063.54 --> 4074.54]  he to rescue me from danger, bought me with his precious blood.
[4074.54 --> 4088.54]  Oh, to grace how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be. Let that grace now, like a fetter,
[4088.54 --> 4101.54]  bind my wandering heart to thee. Prone to wander on I feel it, prone to leave the God I love.
[4101.54 --> 4115.54]  Here's my heart, oh take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above. Here's my heart, oh take and seal it,
[4115.54 --> 4120.54]  seal it for thy courts above.
[4120.54 --> 4131.54]  Before we go to our God in prayer, we just have one announcement. We learned from Janet this week
[4131.54 --> 4137.54]  that her husband John had been in hospital, but we received the good news that he has returned home,
[4137.54 --> 4148.54]  and will in due time begin receiving treatment for his multiple myeloma. So we thank God that he is in control of all things.
[4148.54 --> 4151.54]  Let's pray together.
[4151.54 --> 4162.54]  Good and faithful God, we have offered you our praise. Accept these songs, words, and thoughts from the depths of our hearts.
[4162.54 --> 4173.54]  Now we boldly bring our cares, for you have invited us to do so. Because the very nature of prayer and its outcome is a mystery to us.
[4173.54 --> 4182.54]  The best we can do is come as little children, believing that our Father will hear us, and that he cares more than we can imagine.
[4182.54 --> 4190.54]  You know those among us who struggle with disease and illness, physical, mental, or spiritual.
[4190.54 --> 4199.54]  Some have great pain and can't find relief. Some are plagued with dark days that refuse to get brighter.
[4199.54 --> 4209.54]  Some feel that you are far away and can't find you. And yet, we know that you are so much bigger than our lingering emptiness.
[4209.54 --> 4218.54]  Be with those undergoing treatments for cancer. We ask boldly that you, the great physician, would provide healing.
[4218.54 --> 4228.54]  Lord, some know that, humanly speaking, they are being called home. These need comfort and courage for their journey of goodbyes.
[4228.54 --> 4236.54]  Give grace in all these situations, we pray. Give strength to caregivers and families.
[4236.54 --> 4242.54]  Lord, we pray that we may all deal with our own mortality, knowing that you offer infinite mercy.
[4242.54 --> 4251.54]  We know that death is the enemy. We know, too, that for your children, you have provided victory, even in the face of death.
[4251.54 --> 4260.54]  Help us hold these two truths in honest tension. And may we lovingly support those who need a tender word or active service.
[4260.54 --> 4268.54]  Give us ears that are open to your Spirit's leading. Lord of all comfort, enfold those who mourn the loss of loved ones,
[4268.54 --> 4274.54]  whether recently or a long time ago. The pain only dims now and then. It never really leaves.
[4274.54 --> 4279.54]  Only you can heal wounds of loss. We pray for your grace.
[4279.54 --> 4288.54]  Many struggle with the ongoing pandemic and all it brings. Give hope to those who are living alone in care homes or on their own.
[4288.54 --> 4294.54]  May caregivers offer gentleness, empathy and a listening ear for those who have no interaction with anyone else.
[4294.54 --> 4300.54]  Thank you for all who provide health care in this ongoing crisis.
[4300.54 --> 4308.54]  Sustain those who have lost jobs and are in economic freefall. Give us our daily bread, Lord, by the means you choose.
[4308.54 --> 4317.54]  Heal our world, we pray. We see so much that is broken in our nation and our world, Father.
[4317.54 --> 4329.54]  Lead our Prime Minister, his Cabinet and all who govern us. Give wisdom as they deliberate and make decisions about those things that are most important for the wellbeing of Canada and our neighbours.
[4329.54 --> 4338.54]  We ask that the motives of our leadership in government, in military, in healthcare and other public arenas would be for the common good of all.
[4338.54 --> 4350.54]  Give our leaders integrity and courage and may international agencies work together to care for your world and its people with genuine, deep care that is free from pride and self-serving agendas.
[4350.54 --> 4356.54]  We bring this huge request, acknowledging that you, Lord, are God of the nations.
[4356.54 --> 4360.54]  Unite us as Christians to be carriers of your light and love.
[4360.54 --> 4361.54]  Unite us as Christians to be carriers of our lives.
[4361.54 --> 4366.54]  We thank you for schools that prepare children to take up meaningful work in this world.
[4366.54 --> 4372.54]  May teachers be inspired by the knowledge that good education truly makes a difference.
[4372.54 --> 4379.54]  We pray for Delta Christian School and thank you for the privilege to support this school, which has roots in this church.
[4379.54 --> 4384.54]  May the work done at Delta Christian School bring your kingdom closer to fulfilment.
[4384.54 --> 4389.54]  Raise up children with dreams to use their God-given gifts for your glory.
[4389.54 --> 4398.54]  As we end our petitions, we ask fervently that you would instill in us, your church, authentic and lasting joy.
[4398.54 --> 4401.54]  You have commanded us to rejoice.
[4401.54 --> 4410.54]  Give us eyes to see the beauty of our Lord so that our hearts would be overflowing with peace, joy and above all, love.
[4410.54 --> 4417.54]  Dress us in these glorious garments so that when our groom comes for us, we will be ready.
[4417.54 --> 4422.54]  We pray this all in the name of Jesus, who loves us and never leaves us.
[4422.54 --> 4423.54]  Amen.
[4428.54 --> 4439.54]  Hear now a parting word of God's blessing from the psalmist.
[4439.54 --> 4442.54]  The Lord sits enthroned over the flood.
[4442.54 --> 4446.54]  The Lord is enthroned as King forever.
[4446.54 --> 4450.54]  The Lord gives strength to His people.
[4450.54 --> 4454.54]  The Lord blesses His people with peace.
[4454.54 --> 4459.54]  May the peace and strength of the Lord go with you in the week ahead.
[4459.54 --> 4461.54]  Amen.
