[0.00 → 27.00] In the name of our own name, bless and redeemer, Emmanuel, the rescue for sinners, the ransom from heaven.
[27.00 → 38.00] Jesus, Messiah, Lord of all.
[38.00 → 51.00] Jesus, Messiah, Lord of all.
[57.00 → 60.62] You may be seated.
[60.62 → 65.62] Amen.
[65.62 → 70.20] Each week, we come and we worship together.
[71.16 → 77.10] And we begin by praising God for his beauty and his glory and his holiness.
[78.36 → 87.46] And as we do so, when we see God for who he is, it leads us to a place of deep reverence and also humility.
[87.46 → 97.82] And even more, in the light of his glory, we recognize our own brokenness, our own sinfulness, our own stubbornness and rebellion of heart.
[98.86 → 109.00] But we have the great promise from God in and through Jesus Christ that when we are most honest about our sin and brokenness,
[109.68 → 113.66] God's grace and mercy are most real in our lives.
[113.66 → 121.68] And it's as we see our sin and as we repent of it, and as we bring it before the Lord,
[121.80 → 132.38] that it is in that context and moment that we receive his forgiveness, and we experience God's delight to forgive real sinners.
[133.66 → 137.78] So this morning, I want to read a prayer that comes from John Bunyan,
[137.78 → 143.56] the 17th century Puritan preacher and author of The Pilgrim's Progress,
[143.78 → 147.72] which is one of the most well-known and widely read books in the English language.
[148.48 → 154.60] So let's read this confession together, and then we'll go into a time of private, silent prayer
[154.60 → 157.34] where you can share with the Lord your own heart this morning.
[158.36 → 159.60] And then I'll close with some prayer.
[159.74 → 162.80] So let's first read this together in unison.
[162.80 → 171.26] Often, O holy and righteous God, we dare your justice, mock your mercy,
[172.16 → 178.68] jeer your patience, slight your power, and show contempt for your love.
[179.68 → 186.96] We even say, I'm sorry, insincerely, and confess our sin flippantly.
[186.96 → 193.38] We plead your help to own up carefully to how we have wronged you,
[193.92 → 197.34] to admit honestly how we have grieved you,
[197.86 → 201.84] to plead penitently for your mercy and pardon.
[202.54 → 207.48] We beg your forgiveness through Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Lord.
[207.48 → 207.58] Amen.
[207.58 → 207.66] Amen.
[216.96 → 241.26] Father, together as your people, we come to you this morning freshly, deeply conscious of our sin.
[241.26 → 245.46] And Father, it grieves us to grieve you.
[247.08 → 252.94] It harms us to live not according to the way you have created and designed us.
[253.98 → 259.14] And yet, Lord, you shower us with your grace, your mercy, and your forgiveness.
[260.06 → 262.10] Would you meet us this morning with your kindness?
[263.12 → 270.08] Would you reveal to us deeply the love which you have for us through our Lord Jesus Christ?
[270.08 → 276.28] Would you restore us to full fellowship with you that we may live as your children,
[276.86 → 280.90] that we may live for your glory in our lives and in this world?
[281.48 → 283.12] And Lord, would you lead us in your way?
[283.44 → 284.48] In Jesus' name we pray.
[285.22 → 285.62] Amen.
[286.88 → 290.62] Brothers and sisters, hear this word of assurance from Hebrews chapter 4.
[291.10 → 293.34] And again, would you read it responsibly with me?
[293.86 → 296.90] Since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven,
[296.90 → 302.68] Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
[304.18 → 309.62] For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses,
[310.26 → 317.22] but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet he did not sin.
[317.22 → 322.44] Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence,
[323.14 → 329.80] so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[330.40 → 337.12] Would you please rise and let us sing our song of assurance, continuing to worship in song.
[337.12 → 358.82] Salvation belongs to our God, who sits upon the throne.
[358.82 → 374.72] and unto the Lord, praise and glory, wisdom and thanks, honour and power is playing.
[374.72 → 392.78] Peace to our God forever and ever
[392.78 → 404.46] And we the redeemed shall be swung in purpose and unity
[404.46 → 414.86] Declaring God, praise and glory, wisdom and thanks
[414.86 → 419.82] Honour and power is strength
[419.82 → 425.12] Be to our God forever and ever
[425.12 → 430.32] Be to our God forever and ever
[430.32 → 435.30] Be to our God forever and ever
[435.30 → 436.24] Amen
[436.24 → 457.22] At this time the children age 3 to grade 7 are dismissed to go to their classes.
[457.22 → 469.14] And so before the scriptures read for us, I just wanted to also tell you again that today is a special day because we are having our very own pastor Nancy be our guest preacher.
[469.14 → 470.66] She's not a guest. She is one of us.
[470.66 → 479.00] And normally as you all know she is in the fellowship hall leading worship and preaching and discipling our new Mandarin ministry.
[479.00 → 489.04] But what is exciting is that she is under a process to be ordained as a commission pastor in our denomination.
[489.04 → 495.94] And so part of that requirement because her role here does involve regular preaching.
[495.94 → 500.30] And so she is as part of the process it will be evaluated on a sermon.
[500.30 → 507.10] As you also know of course she'll be preaching to us in English in her second language that is really hard.
[507.10 → 513.58] And so I just want to pray for her before she comes up or then before the scripture is read for us.
[514.72 → 517.08] Father we lift Pastor Nancy to you.
[517.82 → 519.52] Father we pray for your special
[519.52 → 522.20] power and grace
[522.20 → 525.20] in her. Lord would you help her to speak
[525.20 → 527.70] your words fluently from her heart.
[528.64 → 530.78] And Lord would you help us all hear
[530.78 → 532.64] your word to us this morning.
[533.04 → 534.78] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[537.10 → 539.10] Amen.
[552.62 → 555.64] I'll be reading a short passage of the Bible.
[555.82 → 556.80] Ephesians 2
[556.80 → 558.00] 8 to 10.
[559.58 → 560.86] For this is
[560.86 → 563.22] for it is by grace you have been saved
[563.22 → 565.22] through faith and this is
[565.22 → 567.08] not from yourselves it is the
[567.08 → 567.98] gift of God.
[568.58 → 571.18] Not by works so that no one can boast.
[571.70 → 573.30] For we are God's handiwork
[573.30 → 575.36] created in Christ Jesus
[575.36 → 576.88] to do good works
[576.88 → 579.02] which God prepared in advance
[579.02 → 579.98] for us to do.
[580.88 → 582.38] This is the word of the Lord.
[583.08 → 583.40] Amen.
[583.40 → 583.72] Thank you.
[583.72 → 599.30] morning brothers and sisters.
[599.30 → 603.98] I'm so thankful to have the chance
[603.98 → 605.56] to speak here.
[605.94 → 608.28] I'm only a broken white soul
[608.28 → 610.90] but Lord is so good.
[610.90 → 612.92] You can see the artwork show
[612.92 → 615.16] and there will be the
[615.16 → 619.12] music worship and testimony
[619.12 → 622.74] from another famous artist
[622.74 → 625.70] this coming Saturday.
[626.62 → 629.68] So the Lord is doing wonderful works here.
[630.58 → 634.68] What I can do is surrender to him.
[634.68 → 635.88] So today
[635.88 → 638.00] I would love to share
[638.00 → 639.56] the passage
[639.56 → 642.06] from Ephesians 2.
[644.58 → 645.34] So
[645.34 → 649.44] the first point is
[649.44 → 652.10] by grace
[652.10 → 654.24] we have been
[654.24 → 655.36] saved
[655.36 → 659.46] through faith.
[659.46 → 662.32] So the first key word
[662.32 → 662.66] is
[662.66 → 663.26] why?
[663.76 → 665.96] Why do we need
[665.96 → 667.36] to be saved?
[669.96 → 670.44] So
[670.44 → 673.84] from Corinthians 2, 1, and 3
[673.84 → 675.46] we can see that
[675.46 → 676.66] because
[676.66 → 678.24] of the fall
[678.24 → 679.90] of Adam and Eve
[679.90 → 681.92] we
[681.92 → 683.68] are
[683.68 → 684.36] dead
[684.36 → 685.78] in Adam.
[686.48 → 687.64] Because of
[687.64 → 689.32] Adam and Eve
[689.32 → 689.92] they choose
[689.92 → 691.36] to disobey God
[691.36 → 693.76] that
[693.76 → 694.54] cause
[694.54 → 695.30] us
[695.30 → 696.94] to fall.
[697.14 → 698.06] So by nature
[698.06 → 700.20] we are sinful
[700.20 → 701.46] and we are
[701.46 → 702.26] disobedient
[702.26 → 703.00] to God.
[703.30 → 704.50] What we need
[704.50 → 705.38] is
[705.38 → 706.58] what we deserve
[706.58 → 708.46] is the punishment
[708.46 → 709.76] the wrath
[709.76 → 710.40] of God.
[712.96 → 713.80] And
[713.80 → 714.70] we are all
[714.70 → 715.22] under
[715.22 → 716.60] the power
[716.60 → 717.88] of
[717.88 → 718.82] the evil
[718.82 → 719.48] spirit
[719.48 → 720.64] who is
[720.64 → 721.24] the ruler
[721.24 → 721.98] of this
[721.98 → 722.50] universe.
[724.10 → 724.50] And
[724.50 → 725.58] we have
[725.58 → 726.52] no power
[726.52 → 728.10] to fight
[728.10 → 729.24] against him.
[729.80 → 730.18] We
[730.18 → 731.16] all have
[731.16 → 732.32] to confront
[732.32 → 733.18] death.
[734.66 → 735.24] So
[735.24 → 736.64] that's our fate.
[737.22 → 737.84] No one
[737.84 → 738.80] can
[738.80 → 740.28] help
[740.28 → 742.02] themselves
[742.02 → 744.00] to be
[744.00 → 744.78] alive by
[744.78 → 745.22] ourselves
[745.22 → 745.94] to save
[745.94 → 746.50] ourselves.
[746.50 → 747.40] We have
[747.40 → 748.10] no power.
[749.20 → 749.64] But God
[749.64 → 750.08] knows
[750.08 → 751.10] that's why
[751.10 → 752.16] he sent
[752.16 → 753.04] his only
[753.04 → 754.10] begotten son.
[754.56 → 755.26] He died
[755.26 → 756.20] on the cross
[756.20 → 757.08] for us
[757.08 → 758.06] in order
[758.06 → 758.50] to
[758.50 → 759.42] redeem
[759.42 → 760.44] us
[760.44 → 762.10] and
[762.10 → 762.66] in order
[762.66 → 763.12] to
[763.12 → 765.06] get us
[765.06 → 765.88] freed
[765.88 → 766.80] from the
[766.80 → 767.44] bondage
[767.44 → 768.14] of the
[768.14 → 768.78] evil one.
[769.30 → 769.88] From the
[769.88 → 770.56] bondage
[770.56 → 772.90] of our
[772.90 → 773.38] sinful
[773.38 → 773.92] nature
[773.92 → 775.92] so that
[775.92 → 777.00] we can
[777.00 → 777.42] be
[777.42 → 779.38] God's
[779.38 → 780.00] son
[780.00 → 780.58] and
[780.58 → 781.00] daughters
[781.00 → 781.44] again.
[781.90 → 782.58] We can
[782.58 → 783.26] reconcile
[783.26 → 784.40] with God
[784.40 → 785.42] and we
[785.42 → 785.80] can
[785.80 → 786.72] regain
[786.72 → 787.66] his
[787.66 → 788.60] blessings.
[789.56 → 790.24] So God
[790.24 → 791.32] so loved
[791.32 → 791.70] us.
[792.24 → 792.70] So it's
[792.70 → 793.44] from
[793.44 → 794.96] his love,
[795.12 → 795.74] it's out of
[795.74 → 796.50] his love,
[797.40 → 798.38] he sent
[798.38 → 799.02] his son.
[799.36 → 800.42] So the
[800.42 → 801.08] salvation
[801.08 → 801.82] is a
[801.82 → 802.40] gift
[802.40 → 803.92] from God.
[804.36 → 805.24] Not only
[805.24 → 806.20] the gift
[806.20 → 807.68] for us
[807.68 → 808.50] to be
[808.50 → 809.00] saved,
[809.50 → 810.60] but also
[810.60 → 812.18] to give
[812.18 → 812.72] us the
[812.72 → 813.18] gift
[813.18 → 814.58] of faith
[814.58 → 815.12] because
[815.12 → 816.68] we need
[816.68 → 817.34] the faith
[817.34 → 818.60] to know
[818.60 → 819.40] God's will,
[820.10 → 820.98] to accept
[820.98 → 821.52] Jesus
[821.52 → 823.58] to accept
[823.58 → 824.82] his salvation.
[826.16 → 826.40] But
[826.40 → 828.02] even the
[828.02 → 829.10] faith itself
[829.10 → 831.02] is from
[831.02 → 831.44] God
[831.44 → 832.68] because we
[832.68 → 833.30] know that
[833.30 → 835.00] the faith
[835.00 → 837.78] we have
[837.78 → 838.44] today
[838.44 → 840.12] is from
[840.12 → 841.36] the Holy
[841.36 → 841.70] One,
[841.90 → 842.40] the Holy
[842.40 → 843.28] Spirit.
[843.76 → 844.54] Because
[844.54 → 845.44] the Holy
[845.44 → 845.90] Spirit
[845.90 → 847.50] will
[847.50 → 848.60] open
[848.60 → 849.06] our
[849.06 → 850.90] eyes
[850.90 → 852.66] so that
[852.66 → 853.42] we know
[853.42 → 856.40] we are
[856.40 → 857.54] doomed
[857.54 → 858.46] to death.
[858.88 → 859.66] We need
[859.66 → 860.82] the salvation
[860.82 → 861.96] from him.
[862.60 → 862.90] So it's
[862.90 → 863.32] the Holy
[863.32 → 863.92] Spirit
[863.92 → 865.16] who enlightened
[865.16 → 866.68] us so
[866.68 → 867.14] that we
[867.14 → 867.52] know
[867.52 → 868.12] God's
[868.12 → 868.34] will.
[869.36 → 869.92] So God
[869.92 → 871.08] has prepared
[871.08 → 872.18] everything
[872.18 → 873.26] beforehand
[873.26 → 874.38] for us.
[875.18 → 875.32] So
[875.32 → 876.44] in Ephesians
[876.44 → 877.90] One,
[879.24 → 879.76] we know
[879.76 → 881.04] that God
[881.04 → 881.88] chose
[881.88 → 882.74] us
[882.74 → 883.72] in him
[883.72 → 884.52] even
[884.52 → 885.24] before
[885.24 → 886.30] the creation
[886.30 → 886.94] of the
[886.94 → 887.26] world
[887.26 → 887.96] to be
[887.96 → 888.58] holy
[888.58 → 889.58] and
[889.58 → 890.34] blameless
[890.34 → 891.00] in his
[891.00 → 892.38] sight.
[893.52 → 894.08] So that
[894.08 → 894.74] means what?
[895.02 → 895.38] Even
[895.38 → 896.16] before
[896.16 → 896.78] God
[896.78 → 897.50] created
[897.50 → 898.30] this universe
[898.30 → 899.20] he knows
[899.20 → 899.66] that
[899.66 → 900.72] Adam
[900.72 → 900.96] and
[900.96 → 901.34] Eve
[901.34 → 902.72] when he
[902.72 → 903.22] first
[903.22 → 904.24] created
[904.24 → 904.60] them
[904.60 → 904.90] they
[904.90 → 905.62] cannot
[905.62 → 908.56] resist
[908.56 → 909.20] the
[909.20 → 909.90] temptation
[909.90 → 910.58] from
[910.58 → 910.80] the
[910.80 → 911.08] evil
[911.08 → 911.38] one.
[912.34 → 912.86] So he
[912.86 → 913.26] knows
[913.26 → 913.62] that
[913.62 → 914.16] they
[914.16 → 914.40] will
[914.40 → 914.76] fall
[914.76 → 915.90] but
[915.90 → 916.62] he
[916.62 → 917.36] has
[917.36 → 917.84] already
[917.84 → 918.66] prepared
[918.66 → 919.02] his
[919.02 → 919.36] son
[919.36 → 920.52] to
[920.52 → 920.94] save
[920.94 → 921.30] us.
[922.90 → 923.08] So
[923.08 → 923.80] God's
[923.80 → 924.08] will
[924.08 → 925.14] is to
[925.14 → 926.18] unite
[926.18 → 927.34] all
[927.34 → 927.54] the
[927.54 → 927.92] things
[927.92 → 928.44] in
[928.44 → 928.86] heaven
[928.86 → 929.18] and
[929.18 → 929.42] on
[929.42 → 929.82] earth
[929.82 → 931.40] in
[931.40 → 931.92] Christ
[931.92 → 933.48] when
[933.48 → 933.80] the
[933.80 → 934.54] times
[934.54 → 935.90] reach
[935.90 → 936.52] his
[936.52 → 937.54] fulfillment.
[938.44 → 939.06] So we
[939.06 → 939.52] are in
[939.52 → 939.70] the
[939.70 → 940.36] process
[940.36 → 941.78] we
[941.78 → 942.18] are in
[942.18 → 942.32] the
[942.32 → 942.74] process
[942.74 → 943.46] because
[943.46 → 943.88] Jesus
[943.88 → 945.00] has died
[945.00 → 945.38] on the
[945.38 → 945.80] cross
[945.80 → 947.04] and
[947.04 → 948.08] when
[948.08 → 949.06] before
[949.06 → 950.28] he's
[950.28 → 950.76] dying
[950.76 → 951.46] he said
[951.46 → 951.94] the last
[951.94 → 952.24] word
[952.24 → 952.68] what?
[954.30 → 955.10] Finished
[955.10 → 957.06] all
[957.06 → 957.64] is
[957.64 → 958.06] done.
[958.94 → 959.08] So
[959.08 → 959.58] Jesus
[959.58 → 959.98] has
[959.98 → 960.98] accomplished
[960.98 → 962.16] his
[962.16 → 962.64] task
[962.64 → 963.22] not just
[963.22 → 963.82] to save
[963.82 → 964.14] us
[964.14 → 965.12] but also
[965.12 → 965.96] bring us
[965.96 → 966.62] back to
[966.62 → 967.08] heaven
[967.08 → 968.02] to be
[968.02 → 968.48] holy
[968.48 → 969.14] and
[969.14 → 970.06] blameless.
[971.40 → 971.52] So
[971.52 → 972.26] that's
[972.26 → 972.90] God's
[972.90 → 973.18] will.
[974.54 → 974.94] That's
[974.94 → 975.30] God's
[975.30 → 975.56] will
[975.56 → 977.12] to
[977.12 → 977.78] unite
[977.78 → 978.56] us
[978.56 → 979.34] all
[979.34 → 980.02] in
[980.02 → 980.38] Jesus
[980.38 → 981.06] Christ
[981.06 → 982.98] so
[982.98 → 983.44] that
[983.44 → 985.60] by
[985.60 → 986.30] the end
[986.30 → 986.90] of the
[986.90 → 987.32] time
[987.32 → 988.68] all
[988.68 → 988.92] the
[988.92 → 989.24] things
[989.24 → 989.50] will
[989.50 → 989.72] be
[989.72 → 990.32] destroyed
[990.32 → 991.48] all
[991.48 → 991.74] the
[991.74 → 992.04] things
[992.04 → 992.74] without
[992.74 → 994.04] eternal
[994.04 → 994.62] value
[994.62 → 996.36] will
[996.36 → 996.62] be
[996.62 → 997.22] destroyed
[997.22 → 998.40] only
[998.40 → 999.44] those
[999.44 → 1000.08] in
[1000.08 → 1000.64] Christ
[1000.64 → 1001.40] will
[1001.40 → 1001.58] be
[1001.58 → 1002.02] lifted
[1002.02 → 1002.40] up
[1002.40 → 1002.88] and
[1002.88 → 1003.18] will
[1003.18 → 1003.72] meet
[1003.72 → 1003.98] the
[1003.98 → 1004.36] Lord
[1004.36 → 1004.76] in
[1004.76 → 1005.14] heaven
[1005.14 → 1006.28] and
[1006.28 → 1006.56] we
[1006.56 → 1006.90] will
[1006.90 → 1008.28] get
[1008.28 → 1008.92] married
[1008.92 → 1010.66] to
[1010.66 → 1011.06] Jesus
[1011.06 → 1011.58] Christ
[1011.58 → 1011.86] our
[1011.86 → 1012.30] Lord
[1012.30 → 1012.76] and
[1012.76 → 1012.90] so
[1012.90 → 1013.42] all
[1013.42 → 1013.84] things
[1013.84 → 1014.46] unite
[1014.46 → 1015.04] together
[1015.04 → 1015.70] that's
[1015.70 → 1016.14] God's
[1016.14 → 1016.44] will
[1016.44 → 1017.28] that's
[1017.28 → 1017.52] the
[1017.52 → 1018.12] mystery
[1018.12 → 1019.86] apostle
[1019.86 → 1020.44] Paul
[1020.44 → 1020.96] is
[1020.96 → 1021.68] revealing
[1021.68 → 1022.02] to
[1022.02 → 1022.46] us
[1022.46 → 1025.56] so
[1025.56 → 1027.42] I think
[1027.42 → 1027.80] God
[1027.80 → 1028.38] is so
[1028.38 → 1028.98] good
[1028.98 → 1029.82] and
[1029.82 → 1030.12] then
[1030.12 → 1030.68] it's
[1030.68 → 1031.12] not
[1031.12 → 1032.10] what
[1032.10 → 1032.68] we can
[1032.68 → 1032.98] do
[1032.98 → 1033.24] to
[1033.24 → 1033.78] save
[1033.78 → 1034.42] ourselves
[1034.42 → 1035.10] we can
[1035.10 → 1035.32] do
[1035.32 → 1035.74] nothing
[1035.74 → 1036.38] we
[1036.38 → 1036.72] even
[1036.72 → 1036.94] do
[1036.94 → 1037.24] not
[1037.24 → 1037.66] have
[1037.66 → 1037.88] the
[1037.88 → 1038.30] will
[1038.30 → 1038.92] to
[1038.92 → 1039.20] be
[1039.20 → 1039.62] saved
[1039.62 → 1040.56] even
[1040.56 → 1040.80] the
[1040.80 → 1041.20] will
[1041.20 → 1041.48] the
[1041.48 → 1041.96] faith
[1041.96 → 1042.20] is
[1042.20 → 1042.60] granted
[1042.60 → 1042.98] by
[1042.98 → 1043.38] God
[1043.38 → 1044.16] and
[1044.16 → 1044.52] we
[1044.52 → 1045.12] cannot
[1045.12 → 1045.98] do
[1045.98 → 1046.82] anything
[1046.82 → 1048.14] to
[1048.14 → 1048.62] please
[1048.62 → 1049.08] God
[1049.08 → 1050.52] through
[1050.52 → 1051.10] our
[1051.10 → 1051.78] flesh
[1051.78 → 1052.82] because
[1052.82 → 1053.88] in
[1053.88 → 1054.14] our
[1054.14 → 1054.60] flesh
[1054.60 → 1055.24] what
[1055.24 → 1055.48] we
[1055.48 → 1055.84] have
[1055.84 → 1056.06] is
[1056.06 → 1056.38] only
[1056.38 → 1056.72] the
[1056.72 → 1057.60] evil
[1057.60 → 1058.16] sauce
[1058.16 → 1060.62] so
[1060.62 → 1062.56] in
[1062.56 → 1062.92] John
[1062.92 → 1063.74] 6
[1063.74 → 1064.92] the
[1064.92 → 1065.26] Jewish
[1065.26 → 1065.70] people
[1065.70 → 1065.96] they
[1065.96 → 1066.38] asked
[1066.38 → 1066.80] Jesus
[1066.80 → 1067.52] what
[1067.52 → 1067.84] we
[1067.84 → 1068.08] can
[1068.08 → 1068.44] do
[1068.44 → 1069.58] to
[1069.58 → 1070.08] please
[1070.08 → 1070.40] God
[1070.40 → 1070.64] to
[1070.64 → 1070.88] do
[1070.88 → 1071.32] God's
[1071.32 → 1071.70] work
[1071.70 → 1072.94] what's
[1072.94 → 1073.20] Jesus
[1073.20 → 1073.74] answer
[1073.74 → 1077.22] to
[1077.22 → 1078.34] believe
[1078.34 → 1078.80] in
[1078.80 → 1079.56] the
[1079.56 → 1079.98] one
[1079.98 → 1081.82] the
[1081.82 → 1082.24] Lord
[1082.24 → 1082.60] has
[1082.60 → 1083.04] sent
[1083.04 → 1083.50] so
[1083.50 → 1083.76] to
[1083.76 → 1084.18] believe
[1084.18 → 1084.50] in
[1084.50 → 1084.88] Jesus
[1084.88 → 1085.76] so
[1085.76 → 1086.08] how
[1086.08 → 1086.34] can
[1086.34 → 1086.54] we
[1086.54 → 1087.06] believe
[1087.06 → 1088.56] only
[1088.56 → 1089.10] after
[1089.10 → 1089.90] our

[1090.50 → 1092.16] are

[1096.54 → 1096.96] us
[1096.96 → 1097.66] what
[1097.66 → 1098.02] is
[1098.02 → 1099.04] the
[1099.04 → 1099.48] good
[1099.48 → 1099.82] will
[1099.82 → 1100.30] of
[1100.30 → 1100.68] God
[1100.68 → 1101.46] what
[1101.46 → 1101.78] we
[1101.78 → 1102.18] should
[1102.18 → 1102.62] do
[1102.62 → 1103.36] to
[1103.36 → 1104.12] please
[1104.12 → 1104.56] God
[1104.56 → 1105.70] so

[1107.46 → 1108.90] assurance
[1108.90 → 1110.30] of
[1110.30 → 1111.30] our
[1111.30 → 1112.46] salvation
[1112.46 → 1113.44] this
[1113.44 → 1114.12] confidence
[1114.12 → 1115.18] in
[1115.18 → 1115.76] hoping
[1115.76 → 1116.64] Jesus
[1116.64 → 1117.28] coming
[1117.28 → 1117.72] back
[1117.72 → 1118.58] is
[1118.58 → 1119.10] all
[1119.10 → 1119.48] from
[1119.48 → 1119.92] God
[1119.92 → 1120.88] he
[1120.88 → 1121.28] is
[1121.28 → 1121.72] so
[1121.72 → 1122.92] wonderful
[1122.92 → 1123.68] he
[1123.68 → 1124.10] is
[1124.10 → 1124.90] almighty
[1124.90 → 1125.24] he
[1125.24 → 1125.90] knows
[1125.90 → 1127.04] everything
[1127.04 → 1128.64] even
[1128.64 → 1129.30] before
[1129.30 → 1130.14] this
[1130.14 → 1130.66] happened
[1130.66 → 1131.92] and

[1134.06 → 1134.86] arranged
[1134.86 → 1135.62] everything
[1135.62 → 1136.40] for us
[1136.40 → 1136.86] so
[1136.86 → 1137.26] what
[1137.26 → 1137.58] we
[1137.58 → 1137.84] should
[1137.84 → 1138.20] do
[1138.20 → 1138.68] in

[1144.92 → 1145.42] we
[1145.42 → 1145.78] are
[1145.78 → 1146.22] like

[1148.74 → 1148.98] can
[1148.98 → 1149.26] do
[1149.26 → 1149.66] is

[1153.66 → 1154.30] praise
[1154.30 → 1154.80] and
[1154.80 → 1155.18] also
[1155.18 → 1155.78] to
[1155.78 → 1156.28] wait
[1156.28 → 1156.78] for
[1156.78 → 1157.16] his

[1432.06 → 1432.42] us
[1432.42 → 1433.48] so
[1433.48 → 1433.90] are
[1433.90 → 1434.02] you
[1434.02 → 1434.48] afraid
[1434.48 → 1434.82] of
[1434.82 → 1435.04] the
[1435.04 → 1435.62] pandemic
[1435.62 → 1439.38] if
[1439.38 → 1439.52] you
[1439.52 → 1439.96] truly
[1439.96 → 1440.52] believe
[1440.52 → 1440.78] in
[1440.78 → 1441.16] God
[1441.16 → 1442.52] even
[1442.52 → 1442.90] the
[1442.90 → 1443.42] pandemic
[1443.42 → 1444.98] will
[1444.98 → 1445.56] cause
[1445.56 → 1446.06] death
[1446.06 → 1447.04] but
[1447.04 → 1447.32] for
[1447.32 → 1447.78] us
[1447.78 → 1448.88] to
[1448.88 → 1449.32] die
[1449.32 → 1449.56] is
[1449.56 → 1449.82] to
[1449.82 → 1450.24] win
[1450.24 → 1450.78] to
[1450.78 → 1451.30] unite
[1451.30 → 1451.88] together
[1451.88 → 1452.16] with
[1452.16 → 1452.60] Jesus
[1452.60 → 1453.84] so
[1453.84 → 1454.16] what
[1454.16 → 1454.38] kind
[1454.38 → 1454.58] of
[1454.58 → 1454.80] fear
[1454.80 → 1455.02] should
[1455.02 → 1455.22] we
[1455.22 → 1455.66] have
[1455.66 → 1456.96] Jesus
[1456.96 → 1457.32] has
[1457.32 → 1457.78] died
[1457.78 → 1458.02] to
[1458.02 → 1458.74] destroy
[1458.74 → 1459.06] the
[1459.06 → 1459.70] power
[1459.70 → 1460.58] of
[1460.58 → 1461.02] death
[1461.02 → 1463.74] so
[1463.74 → 1464.20] that's
[1464.20 → 1464.46] our
[1464.46 → 1464.98] faith
[1464.98 → 1466.80] so
[1466.80 → 1467.16] when
[1467.16 → 1467.56] we
[1467.56 → 1468.30] truly
[1468.30 → 1469.28] know
[1469.28 → 1469.80] this
[1469.80 → 1470.36] know
[1470.36 → 1470.92] God's
[1470.92 → 1471.22] will
[1471.22 → 1471.72] is
[1471.72 → 1471.94] for
[1471.94 → 1472.30] us
[1472.30 → 1472.54] to
[1472.54 → 1473.14] call
[1473.14 → 1473.44] on
[1473.44 → 1473.68] his
[1473.68 → 1474.02] name
[1474.02 → 1474.42] to
[1474.42 → 1475.12] truly
[1475.12 → 1476.64] follow
[1476.64 → 1477.12] him
[1477.12 → 1478.02] even
[1478.02 → 1478.56] through
[1478.56 → 1479.08] the
[1479.08 → 1479.52] valley
[1479.52 → 1479.78] of
[1479.78 → 1480.22] death
[1480.22 → 1482.24] he
[1482.24 → 1482.76] will
[1482.76 → 1484.82] give
[1484.82 → 1485.10] us
[1485.10 → 1485.38] a
[1485.38 → 1485.80] fist
[1485.80 → 1487.32] in
[1487.32 → 1487.72] front
[1487.72 → 1488.02] of
[1488.02 → 1488.78] enemies
[1488.78 → 1490.48] so
[1490.48 → 1490.86] what
[1490.86 → 1491.40] I
[1491.40 → 1491.64] can
[1491.64 → 1492.06] see
[1492.06 → 1493.42] is
[1493.42 → 1493.92] what
[1493.92 → 1494.18] you
[1494.18 → 1494.44] will
[1494.44 → 1494.84] see
[1494.84 → 1495.38] in
[1495.38 → 1495.52] the
[1495.52 → 1495.96] phone
[1495.96 → 1498.36] that's
[1498.36 → 1498.64] the
[1498.64 → 1499.60] art
[1499.60 → 1499.98] show
[1499.98 → 1500.88] by
[1500.88 → 1501.16] so
[1501.16 → 1501.50] many
[1501.50 → 1502.12] artists
[1502.12 → 1502.54] I
[1502.54 → 1502.74] have
[1502.74 → 1503.16] never
[1503.16 → 1503.84] imagined
[1503.84 → 1504.14] that
[1504.14 → 1504.30] they
[1504.30 → 1504.50] will
[1504.50 → 1505.00] change
[1505.00 → 1505.28] our
[1505.28 → 1505.60] phone
[1505.60 → 1505.96] into
[1505.96 → 1506.30] a
[1506.30 → 1507.06] gallery
[1507.06 → 1509.42] but
[1509.42 → 1509.62] they
[1509.62 → 1510.12] did
[1510.12 → 1512.28] to be
[1512.28 → 1512.64] frank
[1512.64 → 1512.96] we
[1512.96 → 1513.20] have
[1513.20 → 1513.94] experienced
[1513.94 → 1514.52] a lot
[1514.52 → 1514.70] of
[1514.70 → 1515.34] struggles
[1515.34 → 1516.04] the
[1516.04 → 1516.58] artists
[1516.58 → 1517.26] they
[1517.26 → 1517.88] are
[1517.88 → 1518.18] self
[1518.18 → 1518.60] centred
[1518.60 → 1519.24] they
[1519.24 → 1519.52] want
[1519.52 → 1520.14] everything
[1520.14 → 1520.56] to be
[1520.56 → 1521.16] perfect
[1521.16 → 1521.64] and
[1521.64 → 1521.98] so
[1521.98 → 1522.38] many
[1522.38 → 1523.20] different
[1523.20 → 1524.24] opinions
[1524.24 → 1525.32] so
[1525.32 → 1525.64] how
[1525.64 → 1525.86] can
[1525.86 → 1526.04] we
[1526.04 → 1526.36] get
[1526.36 → 1526.52] it
[1526.52 → 1526.90] work
[1526.90 → 1527.30] out
[1527.30 → 1528.16] by
[1528.16 → 1528.74] ourselves
[1528.74 → 1529.72] we
[1529.72 → 1529.92] can
[1529.92 → 1530.10] do
[1530.10 → 1530.54] nothing
[1530.54 → 1531.88] look
[1531.88 → 1532.06] at
[1532.06 → 1532.22] the
[1532.22 → 1532.62] weather
[1532.62 → 1533.86] yesterday
[1533.86 → 1535.00] we
[1535.00 → 1535.26] had
[1535.26 → 1535.42] the
[1535.42 → 1535.76] bright
[1535.76 → 1536.22] sunset
[1536.22 → 1536.82] but
[1536.82 → 1537.18] today
[1537.18 → 1537.52] it's
[1537.52 → 1537.88] raining
[1537.88 → 1539.46] so
[1539.46 → 1540.10] God
[1540.10 → 1540.78] prepared
[1540.78 → 1541.36] everything
[1541.36 → 1541.84] God
[1541.84 → 1542.10] is
[1542.10 → 1543.08] opening
[1543.08 → 1543.98] the
[1543.98 → 1544.36] way
[1544.36 → 1544.68] for
[1544.68 → 1545.14] us
[1545.14 → 1546.78] yeah
[1546.78 → 1547.06] the
[1547.06 → 1547.46] new
[1547.46 → 1548.28] creation
[1548.28 → 1549.48] so
[1549.48 → 1549.68] it's
[1549.68 → 1549.92] not
[1549.92 → 1550.36] the
[1550.36 → 1550.78] beauty
[1550.78 → 1551.66] the
[1551.66 → 1552.02] new
[1552.02 → 1552.50] being
[1552.50 → 1553.20] new
[1553.20 → 1553.66] the
[1553.66 → 1554.44] the
[1554.44 → 1555.46] creation
[1555.46 → 1555.82] the
[1555.82 → 1556.20] beauty
[1556.20 → 1556.50] of
[1556.50 → 1557.04] creation
[1557.04 → 1557.74] so
[1557.74 → 1558.10] what
[1558.10 → 1558.28] I
[1558.28 → 1558.46] can
[1558.46 → 1558.78] say
[1558.78 → 1560.72] what
[1560.72 → 1560.92] is
[1560.92 → 1561.10] the
[1561.10 → 1561.28] new
[1561.28 → 1561.48] being
[1561.48 → 1561.74] not
[1561.74 → 1561.92] the
[1561.92 → 1562.46] paintings
[1562.46 → 1563.82] but
[1563.82 → 1564.06] the
[1564.06 → 1564.72] person
[1564.72 → 1566.34] who
[1566.34 → 1566.62] get
[1566.62 → 1567.36] involved
[1567.36 → 1568.32] so
[1568.32 → 1568.64] through
[1568.64 → 1568.90] this
[1568.90 → 1569.50] process
[1569.50 → 1570.14] all
[1570.14 → 1570.34] of
[1570.34 → 1570.72] us
[1570.72 → 1571.46] are
[1571.46 → 1572.32] revamped
[1572.32 → 1572.82] by
[1572.82 → 1573.28] God
[1573.28 → 1575.00] all
[1575.00 → 1575.20] of
[1575.20 → 1575.54] us
[1575.54 → 1576.32] so
[1576.32 → 1577.02] in
[1577.02 → 1577.24] our
[1577.24 → 1577.86] conflicts
[1577.86 → 1578.46] we
[1578.46 → 1578.78] have
[1578.78 → 1579.08] to
[1579.08 → 1579.88] surrender
[1579.88 → 1580.16] to
[1580.16 → 1580.46] God
[1580.46 → 1580.64] we
[1580.64 → 1580.84] have
[1580.84 → 1581.06] to
[1581.06 → 1581.54] repent
[1581.54 → 1582.58] a lot
[1582.58 → 1582.74] of
[1582.74 → 1583.00] things

[1603.98 → 1604.52] understand
[1604.52 → 1604.94] I
[1604.94 → 1605.46] hope
[1605.46 → 1605.90] Pastor

[1611.00 → 1612.20] but
[1612.20 → 1613.34] it's a
[1613.34 → 1613.96] true
[1613.96 → 1615.42] new
[1615.42 → 1615.96] being

[1703.66 → 1704.94] as
[1704.94 → 1705.24] is

[1712.70 → 1713.28] us
[1713.28 → 1714.12] our
[1714.12 → 1715.20] trespasses
[1715.20 → 1718.74] together
[1718.74 → 1732.12] to
[1732.12 → 1732.76] bring
[1732.76 → 1743.20] Lord, your power, your kingdom is upon us today.
[1743.20 → 1745.90] You hear our prayer.
[1746.94 → 1752.92] We love to surrender ourselves into your hands
[1752.92 → 1758.20] because you are good.
[1758.20 → 1770.64] Lord, you have a pleasant will for all of us to inherit the blessings you have prepared
[1770.64 → 1774.72] for us in heaven.
[1774.72 → 1778.06] Remind us we are yours.
[1778.06 → 1781.58] We are your children.
[1781.58 → 1794.02] You want us to truly follow you so that your pleasant will be done in us and through
[1794.02 → 1801.72] us so that we can be the light in this dark world.
[1801.72 → 1813.02] We can draw the lost ones, the hopeless ones to your kingdom.
[1813.02 → 1815.78] Help us.
[1815.78 → 1817.92] Have mercy on us.
[1817.92 → 1820.38] Strengthen our faith.
[1820.38 → 1825.00] Let us truly know your will and follow you.
[1825.00 → 1827.26] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1843.02 → 1855.78] When we walk with the Lord in the light of vision, am full of Jacob's hearts and worth
[1855.78 → 1857.88] the kingdom of God.
[1857.88 → 1860.12] Stand up NASA.
[1860.12 → 1861.28] Amen.
[1861.28 → 1862.42] Amen.
[1862.42 → 1863.58] Amen.
[1863.58 → 1864.32] Amen.
[1864.32 → 1874.36] When we walk with the Lord in the light of His love,
[1874.36 → 1879.48] God and glory He sets on our way.
[1880.76 → 1886.56] While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
[1886.96 → 1890.96] and with all who will trust and obey.
[1890.96 → 1897.96] Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[1897.96 → 1905.52] to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[1908.10 → 1913.96] But we never can prove that He loves the feet of love
[1913.96 → 1919.56] until all on the altar we lay.
[1920.96 → 1927.18] For the favour He shows and the joy He bestows
[1927.18 → 1931.96] for those who will trust and obey.
[1933.08 → 1938.96] Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[1938.96 → 1947.18] to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[1947.18 → 1955.40] When in fellowships we will sit at His feet,
[1955.40 → 1961.62] and will walk by His side and obey.
[1961.62 → 1967.84] Where He says we will do, where He says we will go.
[1967.84 → 1972.62] Never fear, only trust and obey.
[1972.62 → 1979.62] Trust and obey, for there's no other way
[1979.62 → 1988.84] Don't be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[1988.84 → 2009.46] We continue to worship this morning by praying specifically for the needs
[2009.46 → 2013.20] within our own church family, within our community.
[2014.58 → 2017.44] And so let's bring our hearts, let's bring our needs
[2017.44 → 2020.44] before the Lord in this prayer of supplication.
[2020.74 → 2021.90] Would you please pray with me?
[2026.16 → 2031.36] Heavenly Father, would you move our hearts
[2031.36 → 2036.56] that we, that you would reign in us.
[2037.54 → 2041.28] Lord, as we heard this morning, would you cause us
[2041.28 → 2043.92] to surrender ourselves.
[2044.84 → 2047.20] Lord, you have saved us by your grace,
[2047.92 → 2049.94] not because of anything we have done,
[2050.04 → 2051.42] but because of your great mercy.
[2052.28 → 2055.76] And even faith with which we respond to your grace
[2055.76 → 2058.52] is a gift that you bestow upon us.
[2059.38 → 2061.10] And Lord, you call us to yourself
[2061.10 → 2066.54] to do the works that you have prepared for us to do.
[2067.14 → 2069.54] To be your hands and feet in this world,
[2069.66 → 2070.82] to be your vessels,
[2071.66 → 2075.16] carrying your grace and letting it spill out from us
[2075.16 → 2077.66] into all the world around us.
[2079.30 → 2082.26] So Father, we ask that you would continue
[2082.26 → 2084.14] to bless our Chinese ministry.
[2085.48 → 2089.18] Father, we thank you for what we see you doing,
[2089.18 → 2090.56] not from ourselves,
[2091.28 → 2096.38] but you gathering Chinese immigrants
[2096.38 → 2097.86] who are moving into Delta.
[2098.86 → 2100.66] Lord, those who don't know you
[2100.66 → 2102.02] have not heard the gospel,
[2102.60 → 2105.22] but you have put it on their hearts
[2105.22 → 2106.58] to seek you,
[2107.28 → 2111.46] to be interested in what this good news is
[2111.46 → 2112.32] that we trust in.
[2112.84 → 2114.56] And Lord, you are gathering people
[2114.56 → 2116.42] unto yourself.
[2117.84 → 2120.14] Lord, we pray that you continue to do so,
[2120.70 → 2124.26] that we as a church would see your work,
[2124.94 → 2128.26] that we would submit to it and follow it.
[2128.26 → 2130.36] And Father,
[2130.92 → 2134.06] as we think about being one church,
[2134.30 → 2135.68] Ladder Christian Reformed Church,
[2135.80 → 2138.40] with people who have been here a long time,
[2138.76 → 2140.08] with people who are new,
[2141.44 → 2143.56] people who come from different parts of the world,
[2144.20 → 2145.20] Lord, move our hearts
[2145.20 → 2147.68] so that we would be united in you.
[2148.46 → 2149.46] May it be said
[2149.46 → 2152.78] of Ladder Christian Reformed Church
[2152.78 → 2155.14] that we are making every effort
[2155.14 → 2156.80] to keep the unity of the Spirit
[2156.80 → 2157.92] through the bond of peace,
[2158.52 → 2160.64] that we proclaim that there is one Lord,
[2161.42 → 2162.22] one faith,
[2163.26 → 2164.04] one baptism,
[2165.18 → 2166.68] one God and Father of all
[2166.68 → 2169.14] who is over all and through all and in all.
[2169.90 → 2171.16] Lord, reign in us.
[2173.16 → 2175.06] And Father, would you move our hearts
[2175.06 → 2177.38] so that we would be your hands and feet
[2177.38 → 2179.16] here in Ladder and in Delta.
[2180.08 → 2181.40] May we be the church
[2181.40 → 2183.08] that draws others in
[2183.08 → 2184.76] and meets them where they are.
[2185.24 → 2187.20] Would we be a welcoming
[2187.20 → 2188.88] and hospitable church
[2188.88 → 2191.56] that we would listen
[2191.56 → 2193.46] and then speak
[2193.46 → 2195.14] through your words of truth and grace.
[2195.84 → 2197.06] May we be the church
[2197.06 → 2198.36] that pursues your will
[2198.36 → 2199.42] and your purposes
[2199.42 → 2201.22] no matter where it may take us.
[2202.04 → 2203.54] May we be compassionate
[2203.54 → 2204.80] and mission,
[2205.64 → 2207.72] seeking the renewal of all things,
[2208.32 → 2209.14] but ultimately,
[2209.60 → 2211.38] Lord, being transformed by you.
[2211.40 → 2213.80] as we obey you.
[2214.44 → 2215.84] Lord, reign in us.
[2217.14 → 2218.38] And Lord, we lift those
[2218.38 → 2219.54] in our own church family
[2219.54 → 2220.94] who need your healing.
[2221.34 → 2222.92] Lord, we especially pray for Lee
[2222.92 → 2226.46] and her recent diagnosis of melanoma.
[2226.74 → 2228.04] Lord, we pray that you would be
[2228.04 → 2228.90] with the doctors
[2228.90 → 2232.72] in her upcoming surgery
[2232.72 → 2234.20] on October 13th.
[2234.60 → 2236.50] Lord, would you strengthen her family?
[2236.50 → 2240.56] would you be close to them?
[2241.24 → 2242.50] Would you comfort them?
[2243.24 → 2244.56] Would you strengthen them?
[2244.62 → 2246.34] And would you walk with them
[2246.34 → 2247.28] through this valley?
[2248.42 → 2250.12] Lord, we also pray for Honda
[2250.12 → 2253.94] who is in very declining health.
[2255.12 → 2258.24] Lord, would you have mercy on her
[2258.24 → 2259.28] and ease her suffering?
[2260.02 → 2261.12] Lord, for all of those
[2261.12 → 2262.24] in our congregation,
[2262.80 → 2263.96] Lord, who are suffering
[2263.96 → 2264.86] in different ways
[2264.86 → 2266.44] with anxiety
[2266.44 → 2268.60] about the pandemic,
[2269.32 → 2270.62] with those who have real
[2270.62 → 2273.30] physical and medical needs as well.
[2274.62 → 2276.60] Lord, would your healing hand
[2276.60 → 2277.54] be upon us.
[2278.24 → 2279.40] The grace of your spirit
[2279.40 → 2280.28] be within us.
[2280.28 → 2284.02] Father, we ask also,
[2284.62 → 2285.52] will you ask us
[2285.52 → 2286.40] that we would pray
[2286.40 → 2288.04] for our governing authorities.
[2289.38 → 2290.70] So Lord, we pray
[2290.70 → 2292.86] for the newly elected MP,
[2293.22 → 2294.48] Carla Although.
[2295.00 → 2296.40] We pray for Prime Minister

[2297.90 → 2299.14] We pray for all those
[2299.14 → 2300.42] whom you have put in authority
[2300.42 → 2301.08] over us.
[2301.98 → 2302.68] We pray, Lord,
[2302.76 → 2305.14] that you would cause them
[2305.14 → 2307.30] to govern
[2307.30 → 2309.28] according to your revealed will
[2309.28 → 2310.60] and Lord,
[2310.66 → 2311.76] would you bring flourishing
[2311.76 → 2312.90] not only to us
[2312.90 → 2313.76] but to all people
[2313.76 → 2314.30] through them.
[2316.16 → 2317.18] Father, we pray
[2317.18 → 2318.70] for Peter and Kara
[2318.70 → 2320.66] and their family
[2320.66 → 2321.46] as they're travelling
[2321.46 → 2323.32] even now to Africa
[2323.32 → 2326.30] to pick up their adopted son,
[2327.00 → 2327.32] Ezra.
[2328.42 → 2329.34] Lord, we pray
[2329.34 → 2330.60] for a smooth process.
[2331.26 → 2332.74] We pray for safe travels
[2332.74 → 2334.78] through many of the borders
[2334.78 → 2335.94] that they will have to cross,
[2336.32 → 2338.12] many forms of transportation
[2338.12 → 2339.54] that they will have to take.
[2340.94 → 2341.54] And Lord,
[2341.60 → 2342.46] even many dangers
[2342.46 → 2343.10] along the way.
[2343.90 → 2344.54] Lord, we pray
[2344.54 → 2346.14] for your protection.
[2346.54 → 2347.60] We pray that they would
[2347.60 → 2350.48] be able to bring
[2350.48 → 2351.16] their son home
[2351.16 → 2354.04] and that we look forward
[2354.04 → 2355.84] to them coming back
[2355.84 → 2357.82] and celebrating with us.
[2359.10 → 2360.52] Lord, hear the prayers
[2360.52 → 2361.26] of your people
[2361.26 → 2363.70] and we pray all of these things
[2363.70 → 2364.56] in Jesus' name.
