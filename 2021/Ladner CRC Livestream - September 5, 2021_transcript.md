[887.32 --> 888.34]  and perfect
[888.34 --> 890.08]  humans
[890.08 --> 891.08]  are puny
[891.08 --> 892.24]  common
[892.24 --> 893.36]  and sinful
[893.36 --> 895.02]  how can we
[895.02 --> 895.92]  ever presume
[895.92 --> 897.10]  to be accepted
[897.10 --> 898.70]  by such a divine
[898.70 --> 899.14]  other
[899.14 --> 901.28]  so much greater
[901.28 --> 902.00]  than ourselves
[902.00 --> 908.16]  the answer lies
[908.16 --> 908.96]  in our absolute
[908.96 --> 909.52]  honesty
[909.52 --> 910.46]  and God's
[910.46 --> 911.08]  unrelenting
[911.08 --> 911.52]  love
[911.52 --> 913.64]  he invites us
[913.64 --> 914.56]  to tell the
[914.56 --> 914.98]  truth
[914.98 --> 916.62]  so that we
[916.62 --> 917.88]  can experience
[917.88 --> 918.88]  his healing
[918.88 --> 920.34]  and his peace
[920.34 --> 923.08]  please join us
[923.08 --> 924.26]  in this service
[924.26 --> 925.28]  of a
[925.28 --> 925.70]  responsive
[925.70 --> 926.08]  reading
[926.08 --> 926.92]  of confession
[926.92 --> 930.44]  oh what joy
[930.44 --> 931.28]  for those
[931.28 --> 932.36]  whose disobedience
[932.36 --> 933.10]  is forgiven
[933.10 --> 934.68]  whose sin
[934.68 --> 935.52]  is put
[935.52 --> 936.32]  out of sight
[936.32 --> 938.64]  yes
[938.64 --> 939.60]  what joy
[939.60 --> 940.20]  for those
[940.20 --> 940.84]  whose record
[940.84 --> 941.36]  the Lord
[941.36 --> 942.02]  has cleared
[942.02 --> 942.52]  of guilt
[942.52 --> 943.68]  whose lives
[943.68 --> 944.12]  are lived
[944.12 --> 944.84]  in complete
[944.84 --> 945.42]  honesty
[945.42 --> 947.54]  when I
[947.54 --> 948.00]  refuse
[948.00 --> 948.86]  to confess
[948.86 --> 949.64]  my sin
[949.64 --> 951.02]  my body
[951.02 --> 951.96]  wasted away
[951.96 --> 953.10]  and I
[953.10 --> 953.72]  groaned
[953.72 --> 954.18]  all day
[954.18 --> 954.70]  long
[954.70 --> 956.22]  day and
[956.22 --> 956.60]  night
[956.60 --> 957.58]  your hand
[957.58 --> 958.28]  of discipline
[958.28 --> 959.24]  was heavy
[959.24 --> 959.90]  on me
[959.90 --> 961.50]  my strength
[961.50 --> 962.38]  evaporated
[962.38 --> 963.24]  like water
[963.24 --> 964.04]  in the
[964.04 --> 964.92]  summer heat
[964.92 --> 967.64]  finally
[967.64 --> 968.70]  I confessed
[968.70 --> 969.40]  all my sins
[969.40 --> 969.90]  to you
[969.90 --> 971.00]  and stopped
[971.00 --> 971.90]  trying to hide
[971.90 --> 972.48]  my guilt
[972.48 --> 974.06]  I said
[974.06 --> 974.68]  to myself
[974.68 --> 975.58]  I will
[975.58 --> 976.04]  confess
[976.04 --> 976.74]  my rebellion
[976.74 --> 977.26]  to the
[977.26 --> 977.56]  Lord
[977.56 --> 978.56]  Lord
[978.56 --> 1000.46]  now
[1000.46 --> 1002.66]  most people
[1002.66 --> 1003.66]  would not be
[1003.66 --> 1004.48]  willing to die
[1004.48 --> 1005.36]  for an upright
[1005.36 --> 1005.84]  person
[1005.84 --> 1006.66]  though someone
[1006.66 --> 1007.42]  might perhaps
[1007.42 --> 1007.82]  be willing
[1007.82 --> 1008.26]  to die
[1008.26 --> 1009.44]  for a person
[1009.44 --> 1009.72]  who is
[1009.72 --> 1010.24]  especially
[1010.24 --> 1011.00]  good
[1011.00 --> 1013.28]  but God
[1013.28 --> 1013.86]  showed his
[1013.86 --> 1014.64]  great love
[1014.64 --> 1015.26]  for us
[1015.26 --> 1016.16]  by sending
[1016.16 --> 1016.82]  Christ to
[1016.82 --> 1017.66]  die for us
[1017.66 --> 1018.76]  while we
[1018.76 --> 1019.24]  were still
[1019.24 --> 1019.66]  sinners
[1019.66 --> 1022.56]  and since
[1022.56 --> 1023.18]  we have been
[1023.18 --> 1023.96]  made right
[1023.96 --> 1024.80]  in God's
[1024.80 --> 1025.12]  sight
[1025.12 --> 1026.16]  by the blood
[1026.16 --> 1026.80]  of Christ
[1026.80 --> 1027.92]  he will
[1027.92 --> 1028.46]  certainly
[1028.46 --> 1029.44]  save us
[1029.44 --> 1030.40]  from God's
[1030.40 --> 1031.22]  condemnation
[1031.22 --> 1033.40]  and because
[1033.40 --> 1034.00]  you belong
[1034.00 --> 1034.52]  to him
[1034.52 --> 1035.86]  deadly sin
[1035.86 --> 1036.62]  no longer
[1036.62 --> 1037.26]  has any
[1037.26 --> 1038.02]  power over
[1038.02 --> 1038.32]  you
[1038.32 --> 1039.24]  but the
[1039.24 --> 1039.94]  power of
[1039.94 --> 1040.46]  his life
[1040.46 --> 1041.34]  giving spirit
[1041.34 --> 1042.30]  makes you
[1042.30 --> 1042.74]  free
[1042.74 --> 1056.20]  to him
[1056.20 --> 1059.00]  Jesus Christ
[1059.00 --> 1060.82]  I think upon
[1060.82 --> 1062.38]  your sacrifice
[1062.38 --> 1063.74]  you became
[1063.74 --> 1065.22]  nothing
[1065.22 --> 1066.70]  born out to
[1066.70 --> 1068.08]  death
[1068.08 --> 1070.64]  many times
[1070.64 --> 1071.96]  I wondered
[1071.96 --> 1073.18]  at your gift
[1073.18 --> 1073.90]  of life
[1073.90 --> 1074.98]  and I'm in
[1074.98 --> 1076.00]  that place
[1076.00 --> 1077.80]  once again
[1077.80 --> 1080.66]  I'm in
[1080.66 --> 1081.66]  that place
[1081.66 --> 1083.44]  once again
[1083.44 --> 1086.70]  once again
[1086.70 --> 1087.82]  I look up
[1087.82 --> 1088.84]  on the cross
[1088.84 --> 1090.60]  where you died
[1090.60 --> 1091.98]  I'm humbled
[1091.98 --> 1093.32]  by your mercy
[1093.32 --> 1094.72]  and I'm broken
[1094.72 --> 1095.80]  inside
[1095.80 --> 1097.94]  once again
[1097.94 --> 1099.44]  I thank you
[1099.44 --> 1100.98]  once again
[1100.98 --> 1102.10]  I pour out
[1102.10 --> 1104.20]  my life
[1104.20 --> 1110.72]  now you are
[1110.72 --> 1111.88]  exalted
[1111.88 --> 1113.48]  to the highest
[1113.48 --> 1113.98]  place
[1113.98 --> 1116.46]  king of the heavens
[1116.46 --> 1117.98]  where one day
[1117.98 --> 1119.38]  I'll bow
[1119.38 --> 1122.24]  but for now
[1122.24 --> 1123.46]  I marvel
[1123.46 --> 1125.56]  at this saving grace
[1125.56 --> 1127.62]  and I'm full of praise
[1127.62 --> 1129.46]  once again
[1129.46 --> 1133.36]  I'm full of praise
[1133.36 --> 1135.10]  once again
[1135.10 --> 1138.28]  once again
[1138.28 --> 1139.48]  I look up
[1139.48 --> 1140.52]  on the cross
[1140.52 --> 1142.28]  where you died
[1142.28 --> 1143.62]  I'm humbled
[1143.62 --> 1145.00]  by your mercy
[1145.00 --> 1146.46]  and I'm broken
[1146.46 --> 1147.78]  inside
[1147.78 --> 1149.70]  once again
[1149.70 --> 1151.00]  I thank you
[1151.00 --> 1152.58]  once again
[1152.58 --> 1153.84]  I pour out
[1153.84 --> 1155.90]  my life
[1155.90 --> 1160.96]  thank you
[1160.96 --> 1162.10]  for the cross

[1177.68 --> 1178.82]  thank you
[1178.82 --> 1180.26]  for the cross
[1180.26 --> 1182.36]  my friend
[1182.36 --> 1188.36]  Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1188.36 --> 1194.36]  I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside
[1194.36 --> 1203.36]  Once again I thank you, once again I pour out my life
[1203.36 --> 1213.36]  The children age 3 to grade 7 are welcome to go to a kid's life at this point.
[1233.36 --> 1258.36]  I'll be reading a portion of scripture this morning from Psalm 129.
[1258.36 --> 1263.36]  A song of ascents.
[1263.36 --> 1266.36]  They have greatly oppressed me from my youth.
[1266.36 --> 1271.36]  Let Israel say, they have greatly oppressed me from my youth,
[1271.36 --> 1275.36]  but they have not gained the victory over me.
[1275.36 --> 1281.36]  Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
[1281.36 --> 1283.36]  But the Lord is righteous.
[1283.36 --> 1288.36]  He has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
[1288.36 --> 1293.36]  May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
[1293.36 --> 1299.36]  May they be like grass on the roof which withers before it can grow.
[1299.36 --> 1306.36]  A reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.
[1306.36 --> 1311.36]  May those who pass by not say to them,
[1311.36 --> 1314.36]  The blessing of the Lord be on you.
[1314.36 --> 1317.36]  We bless you in the name of the Lord.
[1317.36 --> 1337.36]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1337.36 --> 1338.36]  Good morning.
[1338.36 --> 1339.36]  Good morning.
[1339.36 --> 1341.36]  It's nice to be with you.
[1341.36 --> 1344.36]  Thank you for coming on this long weekend.
[1344.36 --> 1347.36]  And it's always interesting how when the kids go,
[1347.36 --> 1349.36]  I'm like, where did everyone go?
[1349.36 --> 1350.36]  So it's good.
[1350.36 --> 1351.36]  It's good.
[1351.36 --> 1355.36]  We have many children filling up our kids life Sunday school.
[1355.36 --> 1358.36]  So this summer, as many of you will know,
[1358.36 --> 1363.36]  we've been in a sermon series in the Psalms called Songs for the Journey.
[1363.36 --> 1369.36]  And this is from a section of the Psalms called the Songs of Ascent.
[1369.36 --> 1372.36]  And today we are in Psalm 129.
[1372.36 --> 1381.36]  And what you may have noticed when Joan read it for us is that Psalm 129 is a raw passage.
[1381.36 --> 1383.36]  It is honest.
[1383.36 --> 1392.36]  It's a lament that expresses the opposition and the violence that God's people have suffered
[1392.36 --> 1395.36]  throughout their history.
[1395.36 --> 1398.36]  And yet, it is triumphant.
[1398.36 --> 1401.36]  It is a song about perseverance.
[1401.36 --> 1404.36]  And that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[1404.36 --> 1406.36]  And this is the song of perseverance.
[1406.36 --> 1408.36]  So let me pray for us.
[1408.36 --> 1409.36]  And then we'll jump into the passage.
[1409.36 --> 1411.36]  Let's pray.
[1411.36 --> 1417.36]  Our Heavenly Father, you have called us as your children, sons and daughters,
[1417.36 --> 1422.36]  to know you and to be loved by you.
[1422.36 --> 1427.36]  And Father, we come before you this morning asking that you would give us ears to hear
[1427.36 --> 1431.36]  and hearts to trust and believe your word to us.
[1431.36 --> 1436.36]  And Lord, would it change us by the power of your Holy Spirit at work within us.
[1436.36 --> 1439.36]  And we pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[1439.36 --> 1440.36]  Amen.
[1440.36 --> 1450.36]  So my parents are still living in the house in Vermont that I grew up in since I was eight years old.
[1450.36 --> 1453.36]  And so they've lived there for over 30 years.
[1453.36 --> 1462.36]  And over the years when you've lived in a house for a long time, what happens is stuff accumulates, doesn't it?
[1462.36 --> 1465.36]  And it's not all their fault.
[1465.36 --> 1472.36]  My siblings, I'm the oldest of four, and my siblings, we have all moved out and left home.
[1472.36 --> 1478.36]  And some of it is my fault because I've done the same thing.
[1478.36 --> 1489.36]  Because in that house, right, in the attic and in other storage rooms are testimonies of my enthusiasms of youth and childhood.
[1489.36 --> 1499.36]  There are boxes and boxes of baseball cards that I have probably paid way more money than what they are currently worth.
[1499.36 --> 1502.36]  I have a drum set, Harry.
[1502.36 --> 1506.36]  For a while, I played very poorly.
[1506.36 --> 1514.36]  There are some golf clubs, though there probably are no golf balls because I lost them all on the golf course.
[1514.36 --> 1518.36]  And so we have these enthusiasms, right?
[1518.36 --> 1524.36]  Like, you know, have you ever done that where you've been really interested in something, you've been enthusiastic about it,
[1524.36 --> 1527.36]  and then all of a sudden, you know, you've lost interest.
[1527.36 --> 1529.36]  You just don't stick with it.
[1529.36 --> 1531.36]  And we all do this.
[1531.36 --> 1537.36]  Well, believe it or not, this has a lot to do with Psalm 129.
[1537.36 --> 1542.36]  Because what the Psalm is all about, as we've said, is sticking to it.
[1542.36 --> 1550.36]  It's about perseverance and particularly sticking to this journey of faith that we are all on.
[1552.36 --> 1557.36]  As I said, again, Psalm 129 is part of a collection of Psalms called the Songs of Ascent.
[1557.36 --> 1560.36]  And these were sung by God's people.
[1560.36 --> 1569.36]  And they were sung out loud, these kind of songs for the journey, as the people of God made their way up to Jerusalem on pilgrimage a few times a year.
[1569.36 --> 1575.36]  And what we've seen is each one of these Psalms focuses on one aspect of the Christian life.
[1575.36 --> 1576.36]  Right?
[1576.36 --> 1580.36]  They tell us one part of Christian discipleship.
[1580.36 --> 1594.36]  And today, we're talking about perseverance in the Christian life, of sticking to this journey of faith, of following Jesus and walking along with him, even in the face of opposition and oppression.
[1595.36 --> 1597.36]  That's what Psalm 129 is about.
[1597.36 --> 1607.36]  So, as we read this Psalm, you realize that there are these two beautifully broken out sections, two stanzas, each four verses each in the Psalm.
[1607.36 --> 1609.36]  Verses one to four, then five to eight.
[1609.36 --> 1614.36]  So, this morning, I want to draw kind of two main points, one from each of those stanzas.
[1614.36 --> 1618.36]  And then we will end by relating it to our own lives today.
[1618.36 --> 1623.36]  And asking how can we persevere in our own journey of following Jesus.
[1623.36 --> 1624.36]  Okay, so that's what we're going to do.
[1624.36 --> 1627.36]  So, let's look at our first point from the first stanza.
[1627.36 --> 1630.36]  Verses one through four is what we'll look at first.
[1630.36 --> 1632.36]  And here it is.
[1632.36 --> 1633.36]  So, this is the point.
[1633.36 --> 1637.36]  God's children have deep furrows, yet are free.
[1637.36 --> 1638.36]  Okay?
[1638.36 --> 1643.36]  God's children have deep furrows, yet are free.
[1643.36 --> 1648.36]  So, here's how Psalm 129 begins.
[1648.36 --> 1651.36]  In verse one, and we'll keep showing the verses on the screen.
[1651.36 --> 1654.36]  They have greatly oppressed me from my youth.
[1654.36 --> 1655.36]  Right?
[1655.36 --> 1656.36]  So, there's the song leader.
[1656.36 --> 1657.36]  Let Israel say.
[1657.36 --> 1661.36]  So, everyone following along on the journey, the chorus says,
[1661.36 --> 1670.36]  They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
[1670.36 --> 1672.36]  So, I want to share this antidote.
[1672.36 --> 1678.36]  Frederick the Great was the king of Prussia at the end of the 18th century.
[1678.36 --> 1685.36]  And because of what was happening in the culture, because of French rationalist philosophers like Voltaire,
[1685.36 --> 1688.36]  he was becoming skeptical of the Christian faith.
[1688.36 --> 1693.36]  He was becoming a doubter in the truthfulness of the Bible.
[1693.36 --> 1698.36]  So, one day, Frederick the Great was having a discussion with his chaplain.
[1698.36 --> 1701.36]  So, part of the king's court was he actually had a chaplain.
[1702.36 --> 1705.36]  And they were talking about the truthfulness of the Bible.
[1705.36 --> 1707.36]  And he said to the chaplain,
[1707.36 --> 1714.36]  If your Bible is really from God, you should be able to demonstrate the fact simply.
[1714.36 --> 1715.36]  Right?
[1715.36 --> 1719.36]  Forget all these long arguments you theologians do.
[1719.36 --> 1724.36]  Give me the proof of the Bible's inspiration in a word.
[1724.36 --> 1726.36]  So, the chaplain replied,
[1726.36 --> 1732.36]  Your Majesty, it is possible for me to answer your request quite literally.
[1732.36 --> 1736.36]  I can give you the proof you asked for in a single word.
[1736.36 --> 1741.36]  Frederick the Great looked skeptically at the chaplain and asked,
[1741.36 --> 1746.36]  What is this magic word that carries such a weight of proof?
[1746.36 --> 1748.36]  The chaplain answered,
[1748.36 --> 1749.36]  Does anybody know?
[1749.36 --> 1751.36]  Can you guess?
[1751.36 --> 1754.36]  The one word, O king, is Israel.
[1754.36 --> 1756.36]  Israel.
[1756.36 --> 1758.36]  According to the chaplain,
[1758.36 --> 1764.36]  There is really no explanation for the survival of Israel over the centuries,
[1764.36 --> 1769.36]  Except for the existence of God and the truth and the fullness of the Bible,
[1769.36 --> 1773.36]  That was once delivered to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[1773.36 --> 1775.36]  To the forefathers of Israel.
[1775.36 --> 1780.36]  The Old Testament scholar, Derek Kidner, says that,
[1780.36 --> 1786.36]  Whereas most nations tend to look back on what they have achieved as a nation,
[1786.36 --> 1792.36]  Israel looks back on the things that she has survived.
[1792.36 --> 1795.36]  And this Psalm points to that, doesn't it?
[1795.36 --> 1802.36]  They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
[1802.36 --> 1808.36]  And so if you're familiar with the Bible, you might remember that some of Israel's history,
[1808.36 --> 1813.36]  Under normal circumstances, right, without God's constant protection,
[1813.36 --> 1817.36]  Would have caused them to go extinct as a people.
[1817.36 --> 1822.36]  There's this really intriguing verse in the prophet Hosea.
[1822.36 --> 1823.36]  He writes,
[1823.36 --> 1827.36]  When Israel was a youth, I loved him.
[1827.36 --> 1832.36]  And out of Egypt, I called my son.
[1832.36 --> 1837.36]  And so God's people, the Israelites, as we know, they were enslaved in Egypt.
[1837.36 --> 1839.36]  That's from the youth of Israel.
[1839.36 --> 1841.36]  They were enslaved in Egypt for hundreds of years.
[1841.36 --> 1848.36]  There was no way they could have survived those years, centuries, of cruel oppression,
[1848.36 --> 1852.36]  And this hard slave labor, unless God was with them.
[1852.36 --> 1854.36]  But God heard their cries.
[1854.36 --> 1860.36]  He led his people out of slavery, defeated Pharaoh in the armies of Egypt.
[1860.36 --> 1865.36]  Then further on in the book of Judges, in the day of the Judges,
[1865.36 --> 1875.36]  We see Israel, this small, weak nation, surrounded by all of these other stronger, more powerful, hostile nations,
[1875.36 --> 1880.36]  Like the Philistines, the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, and others,
[1880.36 --> 1884.36]  Who are constantly on the attack, constantly seeking Israel's destruction.
[1884.36 --> 1887.36]  There's no reason Israel should have survived that.
[1887.36 --> 1895.36]  In the Old Testament prophets, we read about how the world's superpowers, the empires of Assyria and Babylon,
[1895.36 --> 1904.36]  Actually conquered Jerusalem, conquered Israel, took them into captivity, a small remnant of the people,
[1904.36 --> 1906.36]  And put them into slavery again.
[1906.36 --> 1912.36]  There's no reason, in no way that Israel should have survived that kind of oppression.
[1912.36 --> 1914.36]  And yet they did.
[1914.36 --> 1920.36]  And that's only the history of the Jews up to the time when this psalm was written.
[1920.36 --> 1922.36]  This was written probably after the exile.
[1922.36 --> 1928.36]  Later, when Jesus was born, the Jews were continuing to live under the oppression of the Roman Empire.
[1928.36 --> 1932.36]  And then since biblical times, right, there's been more anti-Semitism.
[1932.36 --> 1937.36]  There's been more violence toward the Jewish people in the Middle Ages with all the powers of Europe,
[1937.36 --> 1942.36]  In more recent times by the Nazi regime, and then even today.
[1942.36 --> 1946.36]  And friends, the same can be said about Christians.
[1946.36 --> 1952.36]  There's no real reason that Christianity should have survived the Roman Empire,
[1952.36 --> 1955.36]  In the state-sponsored persecution of Christians.
[1955.36 --> 1956.36]  Right?
[1956.36 --> 1963.36]  Eleven out of the twelve of Jesus' disciples were martyred for their faith under Rome.
[1963.36 --> 1969.36]  The whole backdrop of the entire New Testament is the church being persecuted by the Roman Empire.
[1969.36 --> 1975.36]  Being put to death, being scattered, and being threatened.
[1975.36 --> 1979.36]  But here we are, two thousand years later.
[1979.36 --> 1982.36]  There are two and a half billion Christians in the world,
[1982.36 --> 1988.36]  In addition to the over a hundred billion Christians who have lived in times past.
[1988.36 --> 1997.36]  And so Psalm 129 is really the prayer and the declaration of God's people in all times and places.
[1997.36 --> 2003.36]  They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
[2003.36 --> 2016.36]  And so what we see next in the psalm in verses three and four is the writer then gives us a very vivid picture and an illustration of the oppression that God's people have faced since their youth.
[2016.36 --> 2019.36]  So look, we'll look at verse three.
[2019.36 --> 2020.36]  It says,
[2020.36 --> 2026.36]  Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
[2026.36 --> 2033.36]  So as many of you will know here, who are farmers, this is a farming terminology.
[2033.36 --> 2040.36]  And what it's talking about is that, you know, they would have an animal, often like an ox, that was attached to a plow.
[2040.36 --> 2050.36]  And the farmer would drive the plow to create a furrow, which was a trench made in the ground by the plow that would be dug very deep.
[2050.36 --> 2057.36]  And so not only were these furrows dug deeply into the ground, but they were long rows across the fields.
[2057.36 --> 2069.36]  And so as we can, you know, imagine this image is a very powerful and very painful image of what's happening to God's people over the centuries due to the persecution that they have faced.
[2069.36 --> 2072.36]  And so their pain was very deep.
[2072.36 --> 2080.36]  And yet, friends, the amazing news is that even though their oppression has been painful and deep, God has been their help.
[2080.36 --> 2083.36]  And so verse four says this,
[2083.36 --> 2086.36]  But the Lord is righteous.
[2086.36 --> 2090.36]  He has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
[2090.36 --> 2093.36]  All right, what a beautiful picture that is.
[2093.36 --> 2097.36]  This verse four is kind of the center of the psalm.
[2097.36 --> 2100.36]  God has cut the cords of the wicked.
[2100.36 --> 2103.36]  And so the image is the same.
[2103.36 --> 2109.36]  In other words, the animal that is pulling the plow, the cords that attach the plow to the animal, has been cut.
[2109.36 --> 2114.36]  So that God has brought an end to the oppression.
[2114.36 --> 2116.36]  The plow no longer works.
[2116.36 --> 2119.36]  The Lord has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
[2119.36 --> 2121.36]  Okay, so that's the first stanza.
[2121.36 --> 2126.36]  How God's children have deep furrows, yet are free.
[2126.36 --> 2131.36]  Now, the second point we see here in Psalm 129 is this.
[2131.36 --> 2133.36]  Looking at the second stanza.
[2133.36 --> 2138.36]  God's enemies are flourishing, yet destined for destruction.
[2138.36 --> 2143.36]  Okay, God's enemies are flourishing, yet destined for destruction.
[2143.36 --> 2149.36]  So now verses five to eight is kind of shifts genres a bit.
[2149.36 --> 2161.36]  And it is one of the 20 or more imprecatory, I don't practice saying that, imprecatory prayers that we see in the Psalms.
[2161.36 --> 2164.36]  Okay, so in imprecatory prayer, what is that?
[2164.36 --> 2173.36]  It is essentially calling on God to judge those who hate God and oppress his people.
[2173.36 --> 2175.36]  It's essentially a curse, a malediction.
[2175.36 --> 2178.36]  A benediction is a good word, a blessing.
[2178.36 --> 2180.36]  A malediction is a curse.
[2180.36 --> 2186.36]  It's essentially saying, asking God for the enemies of Israel to not prosper.
[2186.36 --> 2191.36]  To not be able to continue their oppression, to be turned back in shame.
[2191.36 --> 2193.36]  So let's read it again.
[2193.36 --> 2195.36]  Let's read verses five to eight.
[2195.36 --> 2199.36]  May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
[2199.36 --> 2203.36]  May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow.
[2203.36 --> 2208.36]  A reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.
[2208.36 --> 2213.36]  May those who pass by not say to them, the blessing of the Lord be on you.
[2213.36 --> 2216.36]  We bless you in the name of the Lord.
[2216.36 --> 2221.36]  So the psalmist gives us this another image of farming and growing crops.
[2221.36 --> 2225.36]  In farming, of course, there's a time to sow and a time to harvest.
[2225.36 --> 2231.36]  And what would happen in the sowing is that some of the seed would end up on the rooftops in ancient Israel,
[2231.36 --> 2234.36]  which would have maybe grass or sod on the roof.
[2234.36 --> 2236.36]  And so the seed would actually land there.
[2236.36 --> 2237.36]  It would sprout up and grow.
[2237.36 --> 2244.36]  And it looks like that this seed is growing quickly and that it is flourishing.
[2244.36 --> 2248.36]  But on the roof of the house, it would not have the soil and water that it needs.
[2248.36 --> 2250.36]  And eventually it would wither.
[2250.36 --> 2253.36]  It would not be part of the harvest.
[2253.36 --> 2260.36]  And so it's this kind of very comical image that the psalmist is telling to the people of Israel
[2260.36 --> 2266.36]  who live in this world of agriculture and they would say, yeah, you know, the enemies of God, they're like this grass that lands on the house.
[2266.36 --> 2267.36]  It just withers away.
[2267.36 --> 2278.36]  And so the psalmist, he gives us this image to give us eyes to see what happens when we see that our enemies seemingly flourishing,
[2278.36 --> 2285.36]  but yet, without God, their destiny is destruction.
[2285.36 --> 2293.36]  And what he tells us is that for those who hate God's ways, who are opposed to God's purposes and his people,
[2293.36 --> 2297.36]  they are like grass on the rooftop that will quickly die away.
[2297.36 --> 2303.36]  And the author is saying to us, you know, it looks like the wicked flourish in this life.
[2303.36 --> 2312.36]  It makes you wonder, why am I on this hard and arduous journey of faith when it seems like the wicked are doing just fine, maybe even better.
[2312.36 --> 2319.36]  But what it's reminding us is that just like grass with no roots, it will quickly wither away.
[2319.36 --> 2321.36]  They won't ultimately last.
[2321.36 --> 2324.36]  They are heading to a destiny without God.
[2324.36 --> 2335.36]  And so it's a reminder that those who are turning away from the life of God and the love of God will not find fulfillment on that path.
[2335.36 --> 2339.36]  So in his book, Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis puts it this way.
[2339.36 --> 2342.36]  I think it's a great quote.
[2342.36 --> 2348.36]  He says, if you want to get warm, you must stand near the fire.
[2348.36 --> 2352.36]  If you want to be wet, you must get into the water.
[2352.36 --> 2363.36]  If you want joy, power, peace, eternal life, you must get close to or even into the thing that has them.
[2363.36 --> 2368.36]  Once a man is united to God, how could he not live forever?
[2368.36 --> 2373.36]  Once a man is separated from God, what can he do but wither and die?
[2373.36 --> 2376.36]  And friends, that's something that we all need to remember.
[2376.36 --> 2390.36]  That if God is the source of light and life, and we cut ourselves off from that source of light and life, there's nothing that remains for us other than darkness and death.
[2390.36 --> 2394.36]  We are not attaching ourselves to the source of life.
[2394.36 --> 2405.36]  But on the flip side, when we follow God, when we are united to God by faith through Jesus Christ, then we have his life.
[2405.36 --> 2409.36]  That our destiny is life with God.
[2409.36 --> 2412.36]  And so that's what this psalm is talking about.
[2412.36 --> 2414.36]  It's a psalm about perseverance.
[2414.36 --> 2416.36]  It's about the perseverance of God's people.
[2416.36 --> 2420.36]  And it tells us that God's children have these deep furrows of oppression.
[2420.36 --> 2424.36]  Yet ultimately, because of God's righteousness, they are free.
[2424.36 --> 2428.36]  And that God's enemies are flourishing for now.
[2428.36 --> 2430.36]  Yet they are destined for destruction.
[2430.36 --> 2436.36]  So that's what this psalm says and what it means to ancient Israel.
[2436.36 --> 2438.36]  Now how do we apply it to our lives today?
[2438.36 --> 2440.36]  How do we think about this psalm for us?
[2440.36 --> 2444.36]  And especially as we need to practice perseverance.
[2444.36 --> 2450.36]  How can we persevere, especially when it's hard, especially in the valleys of the Christian life?
[2450.36 --> 2454.36]  So I just want to give two practical thoughts about this.
[2454.36 --> 2456.36]  The first one is this.
[2456.36 --> 2462.36]  So our third point, I'm not sure if you put it up there, is the practices of perseverance.
[2462.36 --> 2466.36]  And then our first practice is to pray your pain.
[2466.36 --> 2468.36]  Okay, pray your pain.
[2468.36 --> 2471.36]  And so as we've said, this is an imprecatory psalm.
[2471.36 --> 2478.36]  But when we read this today as modern people, right, a lot of us can feel very uncomfortable with these kinds of prayers.
[2478.36 --> 2483.36]  With praying kind of a curse on our enemies.
[2483.36 --> 2488.36]  I mean, and we ask, well, is this consistent with Jesus?
[2488.36 --> 2489.36]  Right?
[2489.36 --> 2492.36]  Jesus who said, turn the other cheek when someone strikes you.
[2492.36 --> 2493.36]  Right?
[2493.36 --> 2499.36]  Who Jesus who prayed from the cross, Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.
[2499.36 --> 2502.36]  And Jesus who called himself meek and humble in heart.
[2502.36 --> 2503.36]  Right?
[2503.36 --> 2506.36]  Those are things that we love and admire about Jesus.
[2506.36 --> 2507.36]  And they're amazing.
[2507.36 --> 2512.36]  But what we also sometimes forget is the angry side of Jesus.
[2512.36 --> 2516.36]  Jesus who raged at death at Lazarus' tomb.
[2516.36 --> 2517.36]  Right?
[2517.36 --> 2524.36]  The Jesus who flipped over tables in the temple because he was so steaming mad about corrupted worship.
[2524.36 --> 2526.36]  I mean, imagine if that happened right now.
[2526.36 --> 2529.36]  If Jesus like walked up here and just flipped over the communion table.
[2529.36 --> 2533.36]  That's what, I mean, that's what was happening.
[2533.36 --> 2545.36]  Jesus who called the Pharisees a brood of vipers and whitewashed tombs because he was so furious that they were leading God's people astray and oppressing them spiritually.
[2545.36 --> 2546.36]  Right?
[2546.36 --> 2550.36]  And so what this tells us is that Jesus is fully two things.
[2550.36 --> 2551.36]  He is fully lamb.
[2551.36 --> 2552.36]  Right?
[2552.36 --> 2553.36]  He is gentle.
[2553.36 --> 2555.36]  He is the humble one.
[2555.36 --> 2557.36]  And he's also fully lion.
[2557.36 --> 2560.36]  The fierce, ferocious one.
[2560.36 --> 2567.36]  And so, I want to encourage you not to skip over the imprecatory prayers in the Psalms.
[2567.36 --> 2573.36]  I'll share a personal story of how these kind of prayers took on more meaning for me.
[2573.36 --> 2590.36]  When Christy and I lived in Taiwan, I was serving in a church as a pastor and someone in the church decided, for various reasons, that they were going to attack me and the senior pastor who I worked with.
[2590.36 --> 2593.36]  And it was a very painful experience.
[2593.36 --> 2607.36]  And in that kind of situation, right, where you suddenly have this enemy who is out for your destruction, the imprecatory Psalms that sometimes you kind of read a little like, what's this all about?
[2607.36 --> 2608.36]  And maybe you skip past.
[2608.36 --> 2612.36]  Suddenly, they take on a whole new meaning and relevance.
[2612.36 --> 2619.36]  Suddenly, the Bible kind of in these passages spoke to me in a way that I couldn't relate to before.
[2619.36 --> 2625.36]  And the great thing that these imprecatory Psalms teach us is what we are supposed to do with our anger.
[2625.36 --> 2634.36]  Like, what are we supposed to do with the anger with our circumstances or the anger that we have towards other people because we are being abused in some way?
[2634.36 --> 2636.36]  Sometimes in life, you have enemies.
[2636.36 --> 2643.36]  Oftentimes, in our modern life, we're kind of insulated from those kind of things.
[2643.36 --> 2646.36]  But even now, we have enemies in different ways.
[2646.36 --> 2649.36]  Sometimes God's people face oppression and abuse.
[2649.36 --> 2656.36]  And when we do, we might relate to and bring ourselves to pray these kind of honest cries to God.
[2656.36 --> 2665.36]  And notice about this prayer, it's not asking for God's enemies to be destroyed.
[2665.36 --> 2673.36]  It's not asking that God's enemies would suffer in the same way that Israel was, even.
[2673.36 --> 2675.36]  It's a prayer to God.
[2675.36 --> 2676.36]  It's very mild.
[2676.36 --> 2680.36]  And it just says, look, God, don't let them prosper in what they're doing.
[2680.36 --> 2684.36]  And those are prayers that we can surely pray.
[2684.36 --> 2687.36]  Lord, they have oppressed me from my youth.
[2687.36 --> 2695.36]  And so what does these imprecatory prayers do is invite us in the face of injustice, in the face of oppression,
[2695.36 --> 2700.36]  not to retaliate, not to strike back, but to take it to God.
[2700.36 --> 2705.36]  And so we can pour, cry out to God with what's happening.
[2705.36 --> 2712.36]  And use these psalms, we can use these psalms to ensure ourselves that we are praying godly prayers.
[2712.36 --> 2719.36]  And even as we pray these and we have mixed emotions, right, maybe not perfectly sinless anger,
[2719.36 --> 2722.36]  God is big enough to take it.
[2722.36 --> 2723.36]  Right?
[2723.36 --> 2726.36]  God can hear those prayers and he can work in us through them.
[2726.36 --> 2727.36]  So that's the first thing.
[2727.36 --> 2733.36]  How do we practice perseverance, especially in the face of oppression, especially in the face of just, you know,
[2733.36 --> 2736.36]  let's just forget this thing because obviously it's not working.
[2736.36 --> 2744.36]  What we do is we can take the oppression, the hardship that we face, and we can bring it to God in prayer,
[2744.36 --> 2746.36]  trusting that he is righteous.
[2746.36 --> 2750.36]  And as we do that, we can persevere in the Christian life.
[2750.36 --> 2751.36]  Okay?
[2751.36 --> 2752.36]  So we need prayer pain.
[2752.36 --> 2757.36]  And then just the second, the final thing, to practice perseverance, we need to celebrate God's faithfulness.
[2757.36 --> 2758.36]  Right?
[2758.36 --> 2765.36]  As we look at the whole story of the Bible, the story of the Bible is that the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth, is faithful.
[2765.36 --> 2766.36]  Right?
[2766.36 --> 2767.36]  Right?
[2767.36 --> 2770.36]  Think about our parents, Adam and Eve.
[2770.36 --> 2778.36]  When we rejected our life with God and we rejected God's love for us, did God then in turn reject us?
[2778.36 --> 2779.36]  No.
[2779.36 --> 2780.36]  He didn't.
[2780.36 --> 2783.36]  Instead, God promised to redeem the entire world.
[2783.36 --> 2788.36]  And the whole rest of the Bible is the promise of God.
[2788.36 --> 2791.36]  And what we see is God working to redeem his people.
[2791.36 --> 2792.36]  Right?
[2792.36 --> 2797.36]  How God has stuck with the world that he loves.
[2797.36 --> 2802.36]  And so friends, the key to perseverance in the Christian faith is not that we are able to persevere,
[2802.36 --> 2806.36]  not that we are able to stick with it, but that God sticks with us.
[2806.36 --> 2809.36]  That God is the one who perseveres.
[2809.36 --> 2816.36]  Not only does God give us strength, which he does to stick with the Christian life, but God sticks with us.
[2816.36 --> 2818.36]  And friends, that is good news.
[2818.36 --> 2820.36]  That is the news we need to hear.
[2820.36 --> 2827.36]  And so Eugene Peterson in his book, A Long Obedience in the Same Direction, which we've been kind of drawing from through this sermon series,
[2827.36 --> 2829.36]  he says this,
[2829.36 --> 2831.36]  God sticks to his relationship.
[2831.36 --> 2836.36]  He establishes a personal relationship with us and stays with it.
[2836.36 --> 2848.36]  The central reality for Christians is the unalterable, persevering commitment God makes to us.
[2848.36 --> 2852.36]  Perseverance is not the result of our determination.
[2852.36 --> 2855.36]  It is the result of God's faithfulness.
[2855.36 --> 2863.36]  We survive in the way of faith, not because we have extraordinary stamina, but because God is righteous.
[2863.36 --> 2866.36]  Because God sticks with us.
[2866.36 --> 2870.36]  It's an amazing quote and it's an amazing truth.
[2870.36 --> 2871.36]  Okay?
[2871.36 --> 2872.36]  It's not about our stamina.
[2872.36 --> 2873.36]  We will stumble.
[2873.36 --> 2874.36]  We will fail.
[2874.36 --> 2876.36]  We will be tempted to go astray.
[2876.36 --> 2878.36]  But God sticks with us.
[2878.36 --> 2882.36]  God will never give up on you.
[2882.36 --> 2884.36]  He will never give up on this world.
[2884.36 --> 2893.36]  And friends, we know that because there is one more final, powerful, and vivid image that the Bible lays before us.
[2893.36 --> 2896.36]  And it is not the picture of what happens to God's people.
[2896.36 --> 2899.36]  It is a picture of what happened to God's Son.
[2899.36 --> 2906.36]  Because, you see, there was another who was greatly oppressed and afflicted, wasn't there?
[2906.36 --> 2907.36]  Right?
[2907.36 --> 2911.36]  There was another whose back was plowed with deep furrows.
[2911.36 --> 2913.36]  First Peter says this,
[2913.36 --> 2923.36]  He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.
[2923.36 --> 2927.36]  By his wounds you have been healed.
[2927.36 --> 2932.36]  So here Peter is quoting from the prophet Isaiah about Jesus.
[2932.36 --> 2944.36]  And it is the image of Jesus who gave his life on the cross for us and rose from the dead to set us free from oppression and death.
[2944.36 --> 2945.36]  The oppression of sin and death.
[2945.36 --> 2949.36]  And to bring us finally into the heavenly Zion.
[2949.36 --> 2950.36]  Right?
[2950.36 --> 2951.36]  Right?
[2951.36 --> 2957.36]  It was his destruction that brought us life.
[2957.36 --> 2958.36]  Right?
[2958.36 --> 2965.36]  And Jesus, the Bible says, was cut off from the land of the living so that we could be cut free from sin and death.
[2965.36 --> 2974.36]  Jesus was like that grass on the rooftop that withered so that we could flourish, not just for a time, but for all eternity.
[2974.36 --> 2977.36]  And it's a beautiful picture of the gospel.
[2977.36 --> 2980.36]  And it's a picture of a God who says, I love my children.
[2980.36 --> 2982.36]  And I will stick with my children.
[2982.36 --> 2986.36]  And I will bring them into life with me.
[2986.36 --> 2990.36]  So friends, God answers in Precatory Psalms.
[2990.36 --> 2993.36]  God finally does put down the bully.
[2993.36 --> 2995.36]  He eventually does put down the oppressor.
[2995.36 --> 2998.36]  And he always preserves his beloved children.
[2998.36 --> 2999.36]  Right?
[2999.36 --> 3002.36]  He perseveres for us.
[3002.36 --> 3003.36]  Amen.
[3003.36 --> 3005.36]  Let's pray.
[3005.36 --> 3013.36]  Father, we thank you that you have called us to this life of faith of following you.
[3013.36 --> 3018.36]  And you don't just call us and then leave us to it, Lord.
[3018.36 --> 3020.36]  But you walk with us.
[3020.36 --> 3021.36]  You protect us.
[3021.36 --> 3022.36]  You stick with us.
[3022.36 --> 3029.36]  But, Lord, you also tell us honestly about the valleys of this journey.
[3029.36 --> 3032.36]  About the hardships and the oppression that we will face.
[3032.36 --> 3035.36]  Just like your people have throughout the centuries.
[3035.36 --> 3044.36]  But as we see from the history of Israel, from the testimonies of your people, that you are faithful to us.
[3044.36 --> 3049.36]  And ultimately, we will make it to Jerusalem.
[3049.36 --> 3050.36]  The heavenly Zion.
[3050.36 --> 3053.36]  While we will live with you for all eternity.
[3053.36 --> 3057.36]  Father, walk with us on this path as we leave from here.
[3057.36 --> 3059.36]  Would you empower us?
[3059.36 --> 3060.36]  And would you persevere?
[3060.36 --> 3062.36]  We trust you to do so.
[3062.36 --> 3064.36]  And we know because you promise.
[3064.36 --> 3065.36]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3065.36 --> 3066.36]  Amen.
[3066.36 --> 3067.36]  All right.
[3067.36 --> 3069.36]  I invite you to stand.
[3069.36 --> 3071.36]  Let's sing our song of response.
[3071.36 --> 3072.36]  It's Taste and See.
[3072.36 --> 3074.36]  It's the new song that we have been learning together.
[3074.36 --> 3089.36]  I saw the Lord.
[3089.36 --> 3091.36]  I saw the Lord.
[3091.36 --> 3096.36]  And He answered me.
[3096.36 --> 3101.36]  And delivered me.
[3101.36 --> 3106.36]  From everything.
[3106.36 --> 3107.36]  Those who look on Him.
[3107.36 --> 3112.36]  Those who look on Him.
[3112.36 --> 3116.36]  Are radiant.
[3116.36 --> 3120.36]  They'll never be ashamed.
[3120.36 --> 3125.36]  They'll never be ashamed.
[3125.36 --> 3129.36]  This poor man fried.
[3129.36 --> 3133.36]  And He'll hold her feet.
[3133.36 --> 3140.36]  And save me from my enemies.
[3140.36 --> 3149.36]  The Son of God surrounds with saints.
[3149.36 --> 3153.36]  He will deliver them.
[3153.36 --> 3158.36]  He will deliver them.
[3158.36 --> 3159.36]  He will drive me from His Father.
[3159.36 --> 3160.36] 'll come 약i.
[3160.36 --> 3161.36]  We are ecstasy.
[3161.36 --> 3162.36]  He will deliver them into the hills.
[3162.36 --> 3163.36]  And Musik Lafriack.
[3163.36 --> 3164.36]  날 garter.

[3181.32 --> 3182.36]  The Lord is faithful.

[3193.76 --> 3197.76]  That the Lord is true
[3197.76 --> 3203.06]  Oh, blessed is He
[3203.06 --> 3206.96]  Who hides in Him
[3206.96 --> 3210.76]  Oh, fear the Lord
[3210.76 --> 3215.46]  Oh, all you say is
[3215.46 --> 3218.46]  He'll give you everything
[3218.46 --> 3222.46]  He'll give you everything
[3222.46 --> 3231.46]  Magnify the Lord with me
[3231.46 --> 3239.46]  Come and start this day together
[3239.46 --> 3247.46]  Glorify the Lord with me
[3247.46 --> 3254.46]  Come and start this day forever
[3254.46 --> 3264.46]  Let us bless the Lord
[3264.46 --> 3268.46]  Every day and night
[3268.46 --> 3272.46]  Ever-ending grace
[3272.46 --> 3276.46]  May our incense rise
[3276.46 --> 3280.46]  Let us bless the Lord
[3280.46 --> 3284.46]  Every day and night
[3284.46 --> 3288.46]  Ever-ending grace
[3288.46 --> 3292.46]  May our incense rise
[3292.46 --> 3300.46]  May provide the Lord with me
[3300.46 --> 3306.46]  Come and start this day together
[3306.46 --> 3316.46]  For divine the Lord with me
[3316.46 --> 3321.46]  For His salt is made forever
[3321.46 --> 3325.46]  Forever
[3325.46 --> 3327.46]  Herzog
[3327.46 --> 3330.46]  Number
[3342.46 --> 3343.46]  McMaster
[3343.46 --> 3345.46]  For divine the Lord with me
[3345.46 --> 3346.46]  Not that God can düş
[3346.46 --> 3348.46]  Let us bless the Lord with me
[3348.46 --> 3349.46]  We will make the Lord with you
[3349.46 --> 3351.36]  How will He be forever
[3351.36 --> 3356.84]  we go to God with the prayers of the people, just a few things to be thankful for. We are
[3356.84 --> 3362.60]  thankful, along with Pat and Peter, that Pat has returned home from the hospital this week
[3362.60 --> 3368.44]  and has improved somewhat, although she is still under doctor's care. We're also very
[3368.44 --> 3373.74]  happy to see Joyce with us this morning, along with Michael, who has a birthday today. And
[3373.74 --> 3379.24]  so happy birthday, Michael, and we're glad that both of you are here. Please join me
[3379.24 --> 3390.26]  in prayer. Loving God, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. Your glory
[3390.26 --> 3397.48]  truly is higher than the heavens. When we look at all your creation, the vast number of stars,
[3398.30 --> 3404.82]  how can we comprehend your care for us? And yet you do care more than we know or imagine.
[3404.82 --> 3411.38]  We can approach you in the full knowledge of your love for us through the death and resurrection
[3411.38 --> 3419.84]  of Jesus, your Son. Thank you for your grace that brought us through another week. You have
[3419.84 --> 3428.68]  kept us in your care, walking with us in our joys, our sorrows, our triumphs, our disappointments,
[3428.68 --> 3437.86]  our rest and our struggles. Even when you seem far away, the promise of your presence is so much more
[3437.86 --> 3445.86]  reliable than our own feelings. Help us to trust what you promise. And so we pray for those who feel
[3445.86 --> 3453.78]  alone, who feel that you are distant and that their spirit is in darkness. Shine your light on us,
[3453.78 --> 3461.44]  we pray. Be with those who are ill, those who have lived with sickness for a long time,
[3462.04 --> 3466.40]  or those who have recently been diagnosed or waiting for the results of tests.
[3467.52 --> 3474.70]  Lord, we admit that trusting is hard. Give us peace that passes understanding, as you promise.
[3475.80 --> 3481.64]  We give you thanks for the measure of recovery that Pat has experienced and ask for continued healing.
[3481.64 --> 3489.12]  Gracious Father, be near to those who have been transferred to a new home because they need a
[3489.12 --> 3496.26]  greater level of care. We think of Joyce and of Jerry and of Anne. Give them a sense of belonging
[3496.26 --> 3503.22]  in their new surroundings as they make new friends and get to know their caregivers. We are thankful that
[3503.22 --> 3509.66]  Joyce can be with us today and that she can celebrate with Michael on his birthday. You are good indeed.
[3509.66 --> 3517.80]  As we remember Labor Day tomorrow, we pray for the workforce in our country. So many have lost work
[3517.80 --> 3525.28]  and income due to the COVID pandemic. We pray for an end to this situation, for work to resume,
[3525.78 --> 3530.84]  and for generosity of those who are still able to share in provision of basic needs.
[3532.14 --> 3539.06]  Wherever we work, whatever we do, may we do it in a way that honours you and our neighbour.
[3539.06 --> 3546.30]  We also bring before you those who will be going back to school this week or starting school for the very first time.
[3547.20 --> 3553.94]  Be with the little ones who begin preschool or kindergarten, with students who will be going to a new school or university.
[3554.88 --> 3560.16]  May they find new friends, free them from anxiety, and help them to be eager learners.
[3560.16 --> 3568.54]  May they discover the wonders of your creation, and by extension, may they discover what a marvellous God you are.
[3570.04 --> 3575.00]  Give teachers and professors wisdom, patience, and love for their students.
[3576.04 --> 3579.22]  Give them joy in this, their significant calling.
[3579.22 --> 3585.92]  We pray for our world and leaders of the nations. May there be continual movement towards justice.
[3586.68 --> 3590.16]  Give hope to the millions of people who are seeking refuge from oppression.
[3591.10 --> 3595.84]  We pray especially for the country of Afghanistan and the dire situation there.
[3596.80 --> 3598.10]  Lord, have mercy.
[3599.16 --> 3603.40]  We pray for the continent of Africa, with many developing nations.
[3603.40 --> 3608.34]  We thank you for groups like the African Children's Choir that provides disaster relief.
[3609.22 --> 3611.62]  Rest your hand of blessing on them, we pray.
[3613.30 --> 3616.22]  Be with both this church and your church worldwide.
[3616.86 --> 3620.46]  May your kingdom come, your will be done, in and through us.
[3620.46 --> 3626.06]  With Jesus as our model and strength, we pray, as St. Francis of Assisi prayed,
[3626.58 --> 3629.88]  asking, Lord, that you would make us instruments of your peace.
[3630.92 --> 3633.38]  Where there is hatred, let us so love.
[3634.22 --> 3636.06]  Where there is injury, pardon.
[3636.90 --> 3639.02]  Where there is doubt, faith.
[3640.14 --> 3642.72]  Where there is despair, hope.
[3643.42 --> 3645.42]  Where there is darkness, light.
[3646.24 --> 3648.20]  Where there is sadness, joy.
[3648.20 --> 3654.06]  O Divine Master, grant that we may not so much seek to be consoled as to console,
[3654.86 --> 3657.18]  to be understood as to understand,
[3657.80 --> 3659.42]  to be loved as to love.
[3660.26 --> 3662.36]  For it is in giving that we receive,
[3662.66 --> 3665.40]  it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
[3665.82 --> 3669.12]  and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
[3669.92 --> 3670.24]  Amen.
[3670.24 --> 3670.42]  Amen.
[3678.20 --> 3683.94]  Brothers and sisters, would you please stand, as you are able,
[3685.04 --> 3687.68]  and receive this benediction.
[3688.08 --> 3697.06]  The world sometimes speaks words that are not words of blessing and goodness to us,
[3697.38 --> 3701.40]  but the Lord always speaks words of blessing.
[3701.40 --> 3704.72]  So, please, I invite you to hold out your hands.
[3705.56 --> 3706.62]  May the Lord bless you.
[3707.20 --> 3708.12]  May the Lord keep you.
[3708.88 --> 3711.72]  May the Lord turn his face toward you,
[3711.96 --> 3713.06]  and be gracious to you.
[3713.70 --> 3716.08]  May the Lord shine his countenance upon you,
[3716.34 --> 3717.40]  and give you his peace.
[3718.12 --> 3718.38]  Amen.
[3718.38 --> 3718.48]  Amen.
[3718.48 --> 3718.52]  Amen.
[3718.52 --> 3718.54]  Amen.

[3728.68 --> 3729.64]  Amen.
[3729.64 --> 3730.64]  Amen.
[3730.64 --> 3730.72]  Amen.
[3731.40 --> 3735.02]  Amen.
[3735.36 --> 3736.22]  Amen.
[3737.46 --> 3737.94]  Amen.
[3742.56 --> 3743.64]  Amen.
[3743.64 --> 3744.36]  Amen.
[3744.36 --> 3744.46]  Amen.
[3744.46 --> 3745.10]  Amen.
[3749.10 --> 3749.64]  Amen.
[3749.64 --> 3750.36]  Amen.
[3750.36 --> 3750.44]  Amen.
[3750.44 --> 3751.08]  Amen.
[3751.26 --> 3751.36]  Amen.
[3751.36 --> 3751.70]  Amen.
[3752.24 --> 3753.32]  Amen.
[3753.32 --> 3753.60]  Amen.
[3754.28 --> 3757.34]  Thank you.
[3757.62 --> 3758.18]  Amen.
[3758.20 --> 3759.26]  Amen.
[3759.26 --> 3760.06]  Amen.
[3760.10 --> 3760.24]  Amen.
[3760.24 --> 3760.38]  Amen.
[3760.38 --> 3761.02]  Amen.
[3761.02 --> 3761.32]  Amen.
[3761.32 --> 3774.80]  I am redeemed from all my sin and shame
[3774.80 --> 3784.68]  Now and forever, praise His holy name
[3784.68 --> 3790.68]  Praise His holy name
[3790.68 --> 3806.68]  To God be the glory now and forever, praise His holy name
[3806.68 --> 3816.68]  Praise the Lord from whom all blessings flow
[3816.68 --> 3827.54]  He has washed and made me white as gold
[3827.54 --> 3838.68]  I am redeemed from all my sin and shame
[3838.68 --> 3849.54]  Now and forever, praise His holy name
[3849.54 --> 3860.40]  Praise His holy name
[3860.40 --> 3862.54]  To God be the glory now and forever, praise His holy name
[3862.54 --> 3873.40]  To God be the glory now and forever, praise His holy name
