[213.90 --> 215.90]  Good morning.
[215.90 --> 219.90]  Welcome to this Good Friday service at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[219.90 --> 227.90]  So during Holy Week, beginning with Monday, Thursday, yesterday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday,
[227.90 --> 235.90]  leading to Easter Sunday, we enter into the most sacred days that are at the heart of our faith.
[235.90 --> 242.90]  And today on this Good Friday, we remember that our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified.
[242.90 --> 245.90]  He was pierced for our transgressions.
[245.90 --> 249.90]  He suffered and died for our sins.
[249.90 --> 259.90]  And so we remember the sacrifice of our Lord with deep gratitude and great praise, because his death has brought us life.
[259.90 --> 265.90]  You'll notice today that there will be no benediction at the end of the service,
[265.90 --> 274.90]  symbolizing the judgment of humanity and awaiting the glorious celebration of Easter when the benediction will be restored.
[274.90 --> 280.90]  And so Jesus himself welcomes us to worship him this day.
[280.90 --> 283.90]  So let us join our hearts together in prayer.
[283.90 --> 297.90]  Almighty God, in this holy moment, this darkest of days, we ask in your love and grace to behold this your family,
[297.90 --> 307.90]  for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed and given into the hands of sinners and to suffer death upon the cross,
[307.90 --> 316.90]  who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.
[316.90 --> 321.90]  So our call to worship will be on the screen.
[321.90 --> 325.90]  I invite you to read it out loud where the words say all.
[325.90 --> 332.90]  And one of the themes of our Good Friday service this year is the theme of glory.
[332.90 --> 345.90]  Glory be to the Father. Glory be to the Son. Glory be to the Spirit forever three in one.
[345.90 --> 371.90]  Amen.
[371.90 --> 373.90]  Amen.
[373.90 --> 378.90]  Amen.
[378.90 --> 405.58]  O to see the dawn of the darkest day, Christ on the road to Calvary.
[405.58 --> 420.58]  Tied by sinful men, torn and beaten to them, nilled to a cross of wood.
[420.58 --> 435.84]  This the power of the cross, Christ became sin for us.
[435.84 --> 447.84]  Took the blame, for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[447.84 --> 467.84]  O to see the pain written on your face, bearing the awesome weight of sin.
[467.84 --> 480.84]  Every bitter thought, every evil deed, crowning your blood-chained brow.
[480.84 --> 496.84]  This the power of the cross, Christ became sin for us.
[496.84 --> 509.84]  Took the blame, for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[509.84 --> 529.84]  Now the daylight flows, now the ground beneath quakes as its maker bows his head.
[529.84 --> 542.84]  Hurt and torn in two, dead are raised to life, finished a victory cry.
[542.84 --> 557.84]  This the power of the cross, Christ became sin for us.
[557.84 --> 570.84]  Took the blame, for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[570.84 --> 575.84]  Took the blame, for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[575.84 --> 583.84]  O to see my name, written in the wounds.
[583.84 --> 590.84]  For through your suffering I am free.
[590.84 --> 597.84]  Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live.
[597.84 --> 604.84]  The one through your selfless love.
[604.84 --> 618.84]  This the power of the cross, Son of God, slain for us.
[618.84 --> 636.84]  What a cross, what a cross, what a cross, what a cross, we stand forgiven at the cross.
[640.84 --> 641.84]  Jesus replied,
[641.84 --> 646.84]  The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
[646.84 --> 656.84]  Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed.
[656.84 --> 663.84]  But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
[663.84 --> 666.84]  Anyone who loves their life will lose it.
[666.84 --> 672.84]  While anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
[672.84 --> 677.84]  Whoever serves me must follow me.
[677.84 --> 682.84]  And where I am, my servant also will be.
[682.84 --> 686.84]  My Father will honor the one who serves me.
[686.84 --> 691.84]  Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say?
[691.84 --> 695.84]  Father, save me from this hour?
[695.84 --> 696.84]  No.
[696.84 --> 700.84]  It was for this very reason I came to this hour.
[700.84 --> 704.84]  Father, glorify your name.
[704.84 --> 707.84]  That the Lord highlights His birth to play
[734.84 --> 741.84]  What wondrous love is this, O my soul, O my soul?
[741.84 --> 750.84]  What wondrous love is this, O my soul?
[750.84 --> 759.84]  What wondrous love is this that was the Lord of bliss
[759.84 --> 768.84]  To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul
[768.84 --> 778.84]  To bear the dreadful curse for my soul
[778.84 --> 788.84]  When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down
[788.84 --> 797.84]  When I was sinking down, sinking down
[797.84 --> 807.84]  When I was sinking down, in the thaw's righteous crown
[807.84 --> 816.84]  Christ laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul
[816.84 --> 826.84]  Christ laid aside his crown for my soul
[826.84 --> 837.84]  To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing
[837.84 --> 846.84]  To God and to the Lamb I will sing
[846.84 --> 856.84]  To God and to the Lamb who is the great I Am
[856.84 --> 865.84]  While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing
[865.84 --> 875.84]  While millions join the theme, I will sing
[875.84 --> 885.84]  And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on
[885.84 --> 894.84]  And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on
[894.84 --> 903.84]  And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on joyfully
[903.84 --> 912.84]  And with eternity I'll sing on, I'll sing on
[912.84 --> 921.84]  And with eternity I'll sing on
[921.84 --> 935.84]  Then a voice came from heaven, I have glorified it and I will glorify it again
[935.84 --> 940.84]  The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered
[940.84 --> 942.84]  Others said an angel had spoken to him
[942.84 --> 947.84]  And Jesus said, this voice was for your benefit, not mine
[947.84 --> 950.84]  Now is the time for judgment on this world
[950.84 --> 953.84]  Now the prince of this world will be driven out
[953.84 --> 958.84]  And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself
[958.84 --> 963.84]  He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die
[963.84 --> 978.12]  I am fulfilled out of the earth,티�
[978.12 --> 990.18]  How deep the Father's love for us
[990.18 --> 994.90]  Has found us beyond all measure
[994.90 --> 1001.44]  That he should give his only Son
[1001.44 --> 1006.56]  To make the wretched treasure
[1006.56 --> 1013.94]  How great the pain of searing loss
[1013.94 --> 1020.00]  The Father turns his face away
[1020.00 --> 1026.20]  As bullets which bar the chosen one
[1026.20 --> 1031.12]  Bring many sounds to glory
[1031.12 --> 1046.50]  Behold the man upon that cross
[1046.50 --> 1053.88]  I sing upon his shoulders
[1053.88 --> 1060.26]  As shaped I hear my mocking force
[1060.26 --> 1066.26]  All out of our best offers
[1066.26 --> 1072.64]  It was my sin that held him there
[1072.64 --> 1079.64]  Until it was accomplished
[1079.64 --> 1086.02]  His time as the Lord's love
[1086.02 --> 1092.02]  I know that it is finished
[1092.02 --> 1101.02]  To him anyway
[1101.02 --> 1106.40]  I will not boast in anything
[1106.40 --> 1112.40]  For his bones are no wisdom
[1112.40 --> 1118.40]  But I am lost in Jesus' heart
[1118.40 --> 1124.40]  His blood and resurrection
[1124.40 --> 1129.78]  What should I mean from his reward
[1129.78 --> 1135.78]  I've had a given answer
[1135.78 --> 1141.78]  But this I know with all I've heard
[1141.78 --> 1149.16]  His wounds have paid my ransom
[1149.16 --> 1172.18]  When he, that is Judas, was gone
[1172.18 --> 1173.82]  Jesus said
[1173.82 --> 1176.44]  Now the Son of Man is glorified
[1176.44 --> 1178.60]  And God is glorified in him
[1178.60 --> 1181.10]  If God is glorified in him
[1181.10 --> 1184.32]  God will glorify the Son in himself
[1184.32 --> 1186.72]  And will glorify him at once
[1186.72 --> 1190.58]  My children, I will be with you
[1190.58 --> 1191.66]  Only a little longer
[1191.66 --> 1193.06]  You will look for me
[1193.06 --> 1195.04]  And just as I told the Jews
[1195.04 --> 1196.48]  So I tell you now
[1196.48 --> 1197.84]  Where I am going
[1197.84 --> 1199.34]  You cannot come
[1199.34 --> 1202.90]  A new command I give you
[1202.90 --> 1204.44]  Love one another
[1204.44 --> 1206.30]  As I have loved you
[1206.30 --> 1208.72]  So you must love one another
[1208.72 --> 1211.08]  By this everyone will know
[1211.08 --> 1212.62]  That you are my disciples
[1212.62 --> 1215.00]  If you love one another
[1229.34 --> 1250.90]  Were you there when they were saved by my Lord?
[1250.90 --> 1260.90]  Were you there when they were saved by my Lord?
[1260.90 --> 1272.46]  Were you there when they were saved by my Lord?
[1272.46 --> 1282.66]  Are you there when they were saved by my Lord?
[1282.66 --> 1283.46]  Is the when they were saved by my Lord?
[1283.46 --> 1292.06]  Is the when they were saved by my Lord?
[1292.06 --> 1294.06]  Eden me?
[1294.06 --> 1313.06]  Were you there when they kneeled him to the tree?
[1313.06 --> 1328.06]  Were you there when they kneeled him to the tree?
[1328.06 --> 1342.06]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes it causes people tremble.
[1342.06 --> 1362.06]  Tindle, tendle, are you there when they kneeled him to the tree?
[1362.06 --> 1374.06]  Were you there when they kneeled him to the tree?
[1374.06 --> 1386.06]  Were you there when they kneeled him to the tree?
[1386.06 --> 1414.06]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes it causes people tremble, tremble, tremble.
[1414.06 --> 1416.06]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1416.06 --> 1428.06]  I know that when they kneeled him to the tree.
[1428.06 --> 1445.50]  After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed,
[1446.56 --> 1448.62]  Father, the hour has come.
[1449.66 --> 1453.90]  Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
[1455.10 --> 1457.78]  For you granted him authority over all people,
[1458.40 --> 1462.60]  that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
[1463.68 --> 1469.62]  Now this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God,
[1470.44 --> 1473.70]  and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
[1474.76 --> 1479.62]  I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.
[1480.62 --> 1486.98]  And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you
[1486.98 --> 1489.18]  before the world began.
[1489.18 --> 1494.82]  I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world.
[1495.52 --> 1496.64]  They were yours.
[1496.78 --> 1499.66]  You gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word.
[1500.52 --> 1504.06]  Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
[1504.92 --> 1509.24]  For I gave them the words you gave me, and they accepted them.
[1509.24 --> 1516.22]  They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
[1517.38 --> 1518.68]  I pray for them.
[1519.42 --> 1524.68]  I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.
[1524.68 --> 1528.08]  All I have is yours, and all you have is mine.
[1528.84 --> 1532.30]  And glory has come to me through them.
[1536.44 --> 1540.70]  So this is God's word, and he has given it to us because he loves us.
[1540.70 --> 1547.30]  So we have not yet had a Lord of the Rings illustration in quite a while.
[1547.80 --> 1549.44]  So let me begin with one today.
[1550.70 --> 1557.30]  In the Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf the Wizard and Frodo the Hobbit are in Frodo's Hobbit home
[1557.30 --> 1562.58]  and talking about how they must save the Shire, and indeed save all of Middle Earth,
[1563.12 --> 1567.16]  by destroying the ring of power that has come to Frodo.
[1567.16 --> 1574.42]  So they're making decisions, and they're making plans about this adventure that they're going to take.
[1574.94 --> 1578.52]  But all the while, they're speaking very carefully and quietly
[1578.52 --> 1583.96]  because there are spies of the enemy who would seek to stop them.
[1585.30 --> 1589.66]  So as Gandalf and Frodo are talking together, here's what happens, and I will read.
[1591.32 --> 1594.38]  Suddenly he stopped, as if listening.
[1594.38 --> 1600.92]  Frodo became aware that all is very quiet, inside and outside.
[1602.34 --> 1604.72]  Gandalf crept to one side of the window.
[1605.46 --> 1610.12]  Then with a dart, he sprang to the sill and thrust a long arm out and downwards.
[1610.86 --> 1611.76]  There was a squawk.
[1612.50 --> 1616.66]  And up came Sam Gamgee's curly head, hauled up by one ear.
[1616.66 --> 1620.10]  Well, well, bless my beard, said Gandalf.
[1620.70 --> 1621.80]  Sam Gamgee, is it?
[1622.44 --> 1627.00]  How long have you been eavesdropping, and what have you heard?
[1627.00 --> 1633.52]  And so I think it's such a cool little scene.
[1633.90 --> 1637.20]  And I'm sharing this with you because in this passage from John 17,
[1637.76 --> 1644.76]  we are led into this solemn, intimate, quiet moment in the Bible
[1644.76 --> 1650.46]  as Jesus prays to the Father, and we get to listen in.
[1650.46 --> 1650.90]  Right?
[1651.64 --> 1656.24]  We get to hear this conversation where Jesus is speaking to God the Father
[1656.24 --> 1660.28]  about their plan to save the world through the cross.
[1660.88 --> 1666.00]  But unlike Sam Gamgee, we're not eavesdropping in on a conversation
[1666.00 --> 1667.52]  that we're not supposed to hear.
[1668.36 --> 1671.42]  This prayer has actually been given to us.
[1672.06 --> 1672.26]  Right?
[1672.32 --> 1674.24]  It's been written down in the Bible.
[1674.24 --> 1679.16]  It has come to us, and that means that we are invited.
[1679.92 --> 1683.80]  We're invited to enter in and to listen into this conversation
[1683.80 --> 1686.78]  on the night before Jesus was crucified,
[1687.16 --> 1692.10]  where we get a window into the mystery of what is happening on the cross.
[1692.86 --> 1696.98]  And what we discover in these verses is yet another image,
[1697.08 --> 1701.00]  another picture of what the cross means and why Jesus had to die.
[1701.00 --> 1706.80]  And here we're told that on the cross, Jesus displayed God's glory.
[1707.14 --> 1708.78]  Jesus displayed God's glory.
[1709.84 --> 1711.66]  Look with me at verse 1.
[1713.16 --> 1716.02]  Jesus is praying, and he says,
[1716.42 --> 1717.72]  Father, the hour has come.
[1718.82 --> 1722.84]  Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
[1724.62 --> 1729.78]  So today on this Good Friday, I want to very briefly consider three things with us.
[1729.78 --> 1732.98]  One, what does it mean to glorify someone?
[1733.96 --> 1737.14]  Second, how did Jesus glorify God, the Father?
[1737.80 --> 1739.92]  And then thirdly, how can we glorify God?
[1740.90 --> 1747.34]  So first, what does it mean to give glory or to glorify someone?
[1748.24 --> 1754.16]  Well, the Greek word used here for glorify means to praise and to honor.
[1754.16 --> 1762.44]  And it means to manifest or to acknowledge the dignity and worth of a person or a thing.
[1763.48 --> 1774.46]  And so to glorify God means to display and acknowledge God's majesty and his honor and his splendor and his beauty.
[1774.46 --> 1783.60]  In other words, the glory of God is God's own beauty on display and acknowledged in the world and by his people.
[1784.36 --> 1788.36]  Psalm 19 tells us that creation itself declares the glory of God.
[1789.04 --> 1792.08]  It displays the radiance of God's beauty.
[1792.08 --> 1805.92]  Everything from rocks to hills to mountains to birds and trees, the ocean and the creatures within it, the stars, absolutely everything, was meant to sing the praises of God.
[1806.72 --> 1813.58]  So everything in creation ultimately finds its own purpose and meaning in giving glory to God.
[1813.58 --> 1825.88]  And in the same way, we learn that Jesus is saying that the ultimate purpose and meaning of his own life was also to glorify God.
[1827.10 --> 1834.12]  But not only does Jesus pray that he would glorify the Father, but also that the Father would glorify the Son.
[1835.00 --> 1839.70]  And friends, that is amazing because it reminds us that Jesus is equal with God.
[1839.70 --> 1840.44]  Right?
[1840.54 --> 1845.74]  Jesus is equal with God in glory and splendor and beauty and holiness.
[1846.52 --> 1847.94]  Because Jesus is God.
[1848.02 --> 1849.28]  He was eternal with God.
[1850.32 --> 1852.54]  So Jesus says in verse 5,
[1854.68 --> 1860.70]  Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
[1860.70 --> 1871.32]  Jesus is telling us that the Father and the Son were giving glory and receiving glory from one another from all eternity.
[1873.88 --> 1877.26]  And so that is how Jesus glorifies God.
[1877.38 --> 1883.18]  He displays the wisdom, the power of God, the Father.
[1883.58 --> 1886.34]  And so that leads us then to the question, well, how does he do that?
[1886.34 --> 1891.28]  Secondly, how is the Son going to glorify the Father?
[1892.18 --> 1895.54]  In verse 1 again, Jesus prays,
[1895.72 --> 1897.60]  Father, the hour has come.
[1898.62 --> 1900.92]  Glorify your Son that your Son may glorify you.
[1902.24 --> 1905.12]  You know, Jesus always knew his hour was going to come.
[1906.08 --> 1909.06]  Up until this moment, the hour had not yet come.
[1909.44 --> 1910.62]  Jesus had remained safe.
[1910.62 --> 1915.66]  Nothing could kill or harm him, even though many tried.
[1916.90 --> 1918.46]  But why was he safe?
[1918.80 --> 1922.34]  It's because we read in John 7, verse 30,
[1922.46 --> 1928.62]  they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.
[1929.94 --> 1931.74]  But now the hour has come.
[1932.88 --> 1940.12]  Finally, we get to John chapter 12, and this is the night before Jesus was crucified.
[1940.62 --> 1946.42]  So Monday, Thursday, yesterday, where Jesus shared the Passover meal with his disciples.
[1947.52 --> 1948.64]  And he tells them,
[1949.38 --> 1953.60]  the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
[1954.32 --> 1958.16]  For unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it cannot bear much fruit.
[1959.28 --> 1961.32]  So what is the hour that is to come?
[1961.78 --> 1965.42]  Well, it means that it is time for Jesus to die on the cross.
[1965.42 --> 1971.28]  He will be like a seed that dies and it falls to the ground,
[1971.42 --> 1975.00]  but in doing that, it will actually bear much fruit.
[1975.12 --> 1976.52]  It will grow and give life.
[1977.58 --> 1980.56]  And that is what will bring glory to the Father and the Son.
[1981.34 --> 1985.24]  That Jesus would die on the cross for us so that we might live.
[1985.24 --> 1989.98]  That is what will display God's glory and majesty and wisdom.
[1991.24 --> 1996.38]  That he would accomplish salvation for us, for the world, through the cross.
[1998.24 --> 2000.12]  That's why he says in verse 4,
[2001.32 --> 2006.74]  I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.
[2007.14 --> 2007.28]  Right?
[2007.28 --> 2010.16]  And that's the work is the saving sinners through his death.
[2011.76 --> 2013.36]  So how does that work?
[2013.46 --> 2018.76]  How does sacrifice, how does dying for another bring glory?
[2019.84 --> 2023.30]  And really we see this in so many areas of life.
[2024.42 --> 2030.54]  But one example is the story of the Catholic priest, Maximilian Kolbe.
[2030.54 --> 2038.58]  He was a man who in Poland sheltered in secret 2,000 Jews
[2038.58 --> 2045.56]  until the Nazis found him out, sent him to a Nazi concentration camp in World War II.
[2046.52 --> 2052.08]  The story is that there was a man one day who escaped from the camp.
[2052.94 --> 2057.08]  And the consequence of one man escaping was that 10 men would have to die.
[2057.08 --> 2061.96]  So 10 men were chosen to be starved to death.
[2063.00 --> 2065.94]  One man who was chosen to die had a family.
[2066.12 --> 2068.22]  And he began to weep for his family.
[2068.92 --> 2072.00]  At which point the priest, Maximilian Kolbe, said,
[2072.66 --> 2073.72]  Let me take his place.
[2074.78 --> 2076.60]  So the guards agreed.
[2077.56 --> 2082.86]  And for the next few weeks, as those 10 men were starved to death,
[2082.98 --> 2085.32]  Maximilian Kolbe led them in prayer.
[2085.32 --> 2088.16]  And singing hymns every day.
[2088.94 --> 2090.46]  He was the last to die.
[2092.00 --> 2093.86]  And that is a picture of glory.
[2094.64 --> 2094.86]  Right?
[2094.96 --> 2099.04]  When we hear that story, when we see this, we know that.
[2099.12 --> 2105.38]  It's a display of dignity, of honor, of magnificence.
[2105.50 --> 2106.04]  It's glory.
[2107.30 --> 2110.12]  There's something beautiful that one would give his life for another.
[2110.12 --> 2115.50]  But friends, the message of the gospel is that the creator and king of all the earth
[2115.50 --> 2120.70]  would give himself not just for one person, but for the life of the entire world.
[2122.14 --> 2126.84]  And so this glory that Jesus is to give to God and that he is also to receive
[2126.84 --> 2129.84]  is the glory that comes from the cross.
[2130.34 --> 2134.48]  Where he gave himself sacrificially so that we would have life.
[2134.48 --> 2137.90]  I want to share with you this quote by John Calvin.
[2139.16 --> 2142.68]  John Calvin writes about the glory of the cross in this way.
[2143.22 --> 2143.76]  He says,
[2143.76 --> 2169.90]  I like that last phrase.
[2169.90 --> 2170.02]  Jesus.
[2170.66 --> 2171.22]  Everything.
[2171.42 --> 2174.06]  All the chaos that sin has wrought in the world.
[2174.42 --> 2176.60]  Everything restored to good order.
[2178.50 --> 2181.66]  Jesus came to redeem us and to restore all things broken by sin.
[2182.12 --> 2184.22]  And he did it through his death on the cross.
[2185.28 --> 2188.64]  And that leads us to this last question for us this morning.
[2188.64 --> 2195.20]  Which is if Jesus glorified God the Father through his death on the cross,
[2195.88 --> 2201.10]  how can we, those for whom he died and who have been saved,
[2201.18 --> 2202.42]  how can we glorify God?
[2204.22 --> 2207.38]  Jesus says something remarkable in verse 10.
[2208.76 --> 2209.70]  He says,
[2210.54 --> 2211.64]  All I have is yours.
[2211.78 --> 2212.66]  He's praying to God, right?
[2212.70 --> 2213.78]  All I have is yours.
[2213.90 --> 2214.62]  Referring to us.
[2215.20 --> 2216.40]  All you have is mine.
[2216.40 --> 2220.40]  And glory has come to me through them.
[2221.58 --> 2223.24]  In other words, Jesus says,
[2223.46 --> 2225.80]  I am glorified in them.
[2227.86 --> 2229.66]  I find that so encouraging.
[2230.56 --> 2230.64]  Right?
[2230.74 --> 2233.06]  Jesus is talking about you and me.
[2233.14 --> 2233.66]  And he says,
[2234.06 --> 2236.74]  I am glorified in them.
[2238.14 --> 2238.32]  Right?
[2238.44 --> 2240.20]  And so what it means is,
[2240.28 --> 2241.66]  when Jesus prays to the Father,
[2241.80 --> 2244.02]  he doesn't complain about us.
[2244.02 --> 2245.92]  He doesn't say like, you know,
[2246.16 --> 2248.12]  these people, come on.
[2248.56 --> 2249.80]  They don't keep my word.
[2250.28 --> 2250.42]  Right?
[2250.48 --> 2251.10]  They're stubborn.
[2251.26 --> 2252.10]  They're hard-hearted.
[2252.98 --> 2257.86]  I get more glory from a cow or a flower than from them.
[2258.30 --> 2258.54]  Right?
[2258.60 --> 2259.64]  That's not what he says.
[2259.70 --> 2260.72]  He says, in fact,
[2260.86 --> 2262.22]  they glorify me.
[2264.00 --> 2265.46]  So then how do we do that?
[2265.56 --> 2268.32]  How exactly do we glorify Jesus?
[2268.68 --> 2269.76]  He says that we do.
[2269.76 --> 2272.90]  He tells us in verse 8.
[2275.46 --> 2275.90]  He says,
[2276.06 --> 2278.90]  For I gave them the words that you gave me,
[2278.98 --> 2279.98]  and they accepted them.
[2280.68 --> 2282.74]  They knew a certainty that I came from you,
[2282.78 --> 2285.32]  and they believed that you sent me.
[2286.18 --> 2286.72]  So friends,
[2286.84 --> 2288.10]  Jesus says that the glory,
[2288.22 --> 2289.80]  that you glorify him,
[2290.16 --> 2292.10]  when you accept his words,
[2292.50 --> 2294.24]  and when you believe in him,
[2294.28 --> 2295.86]  and when you know for certainty
[2295.86 --> 2299.36]  of who he is and what he has done for you.
[2300.36 --> 2300.54]  Right?
[2300.58 --> 2302.38]  And that means that if you are a Christian,
[2302.98 --> 2305.12]  by believing in him,
[2305.28 --> 2306.76]  then you glorify God.
[2306.84 --> 2307.34]  Your life,
[2307.42 --> 2308.68]  this is received as a gift.
[2309.04 --> 2310.68]  Not only are you received salvation,
[2311.22 --> 2312.88]  but just in receiving this gift,
[2312.98 --> 2315.72]  you are now a reflection of God's glory,
[2315.80 --> 2318.58]  that God is glorified in you
[2318.58 --> 2319.94]  through your life.
[2320.94 --> 2323.56]  I think we should be amazed at the thought
[2323.56 --> 2325.56]  that we glorify Christ.
[2326.86 --> 2327.26]  And friends,
[2327.32 --> 2329.28]  not only do we glorify Jesus now
[2329.28 --> 2330.86]  by believing in him,
[2330.92 --> 2332.38]  but John also tells us
[2332.38 --> 2333.88]  that in the future,
[2334.04 --> 2335.58]  for those whom Jesus died,
[2336.08 --> 2337.84]  they will stand before him
[2337.84 --> 2340.40]  around his throne in heaven
[2340.40 --> 2341.40]  and give him glory.
[2342.46 --> 2344.66]  So we'll close with this verse here
[2344.66 --> 2346.02]  in Revelation chapter 5.
[2347.54 --> 2348.26]  It says,
[2348.64 --> 2348.74]  Worthy,
[2348.74 --> 2349.64]  this is all of us,
[2349.78 --> 2351.26]  we're standing around the throne,
[2351.42 --> 2352.38]  and we will say,
[2352.96 --> 2354.92]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[2354.92 --> 2357.46]  to receive power and wealth
[2357.46 --> 2359.50]  and wisdom and might
[2359.50 --> 2363.08]  and honor and glory and blessing.
[2364.44 --> 2366.18]  Would you please pray with me?
[2366.18 --> 2372.76]  Father, we thank you for this glimpse
[2372.76 --> 2373.96]  into this conversation
[2373.96 --> 2376.90]  between Jesus and his Father
[2376.90 --> 2380.12]  about their plan to save the world.
[2381.06 --> 2382.60]  And that in saving us,
[2383.20 --> 2385.78]  that it would perfectly display
[2385.78 --> 2388.40]  the glory of God
[2388.40 --> 2390.02]  and the glory of Jesus.
[2390.02 --> 2391.22]  And Lord,
[2391.26 --> 2392.00]  in that receiving
[2392.00 --> 2393.24]  what Jesus accomplished,
[2393.36 --> 2395.22]  that we also can participate
[2395.22 --> 2397.30]  in this glory
[2397.30 --> 2399.48]  as we also reflect
[2399.48 --> 2400.12]  the glory of God
[2400.12 --> 2400.78]  in our lives.
[2401.64 --> 2401.90]  Lord,
[2401.94 --> 2402.78]  we thank you for
[2402.78 --> 2404.24]  the glory that was displayed
[2404.24 --> 2404.86]  on the cross.
[2405.48 --> 2405.86]  And Lord,
[2405.94 --> 2407.30]  would you be glorified in us
[2407.30 --> 2408.64]  through your church
[2408.64 --> 2409.22]  and through us
[2409.22 --> 2409.82]  as individuals.
[2410.60 --> 2412.00]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2412.00 --> 2413.00]  Amen.
[2413.02 --> 2413.12]  Amen.
[2413.12 --> 2413.14]  Amen.
[2413.14 --> 2413.18]  Amen.
[2413.18 --> 2413.20]  Amen.
[2413.20 --> 2413.22]  Amen.
[2413.22 --> 2413.24]  Amen.
[2413.24 --> 2415.12]  Amen.
[2415.12 --> 2415.14]  Amen.
[2415.14 --> 2415.20]  Amen.
[2415.20 --> 2417.14]  Amen.
[2417.14 --> 2417.20]  Amen.
[2417.20 --> 2417.24]  Amen.
[2420.02 --> 2421.02]  Amen.
[2421.02 --> 2422.02]  Amen.
[2422.02 --> 2423.02]  Amen.
[2423.02 --> 2424.02]  Amen.
[2424.02 --> 2425.02]  Amen.
[2425.02 --> 2426.02]  Amen.
[2426.02 --> 2427.02]  Amen.
[2427.02 --> 2428.02]  Amen.
[2428.02 --> 2429.02]  Amen.
[2429.02 --> 2430.02]  Amen.
[2430.02 --> 2431.26]  So we also now come
[2431.26 --> 2432.80]  on this Good Friday
[2432.80 --> 2435.98]  to participate
[2435.98 --> 2437.14]  in this very tangible
[2437.14 --> 2438.92]  display
[2438.92 --> 2440.98]  of Jesus' glory
[2440.98 --> 2441.46]  on the cross
[2441.46 --> 2442.28]  and what he has done.
[2443.46 --> 2443.90]  And so friends,
[2443.96 --> 2444.76]  this is the table
[2444.76 --> 2445.92]  of the Lord Jesus
[2445.92 --> 2447.32]  gained for us
[2447.32 --> 2448.32]  through his service
[2448.32 --> 2448.84]  of love.
[2448.84 --> 2450.88]  It is for those
[2450.88 --> 2452.10]  who call him
[2452.10 --> 2453.22]  Lord and Savior.
[2454.54 --> 2456.10]  So here on this table
[2456.10 --> 2457.42]  we see the truth
[2457.42 --> 2458.78]  about us
[2458.78 --> 2460.56]  and the truth
[2460.56 --> 2461.10]  about him.
[2462.42 --> 2463.78]  Here we taste
[2463.78 --> 2464.60]  mercy
[2464.60 --> 2466.00]  for sinners
[2466.00 --> 2468.40]  and here we find
[2468.40 --> 2469.42]  nourishment
[2469.42 --> 2470.74]  of his grace.
[2471.40 --> 2472.74]  So this table then
[2472.74 --> 2473.42]  is for those
[2473.42 --> 2474.18]  who acknowledge
[2474.18 --> 2474.84]  their sin,
[2475.06 --> 2475.50]  their need
[2475.50 --> 2476.18]  for a Savior.
[2477.24 --> 2477.92]  It's for those
[2477.92 --> 2478.50]  who look
[2478.50 --> 2479.68]  to Jesus' death
[2479.68 --> 2480.42]  for forgiveness.
[2481.88 --> 2482.72]  It's for those
[2482.72 --> 2484.56]  who rest in him
[2484.56 --> 2486.58]  for new life.
[2488.12 --> 2489.18]  It's for those
[2489.18 --> 2489.96]  who have made
[2489.96 --> 2491.02]  all of these things
[2491.02 --> 2491.40]  public
[2491.40 --> 2492.28]  through baptism
[2492.28 --> 2494.50]  into the Christian church.
[2495.54 --> 2496.76]  And so friends,
[2496.84 --> 2498.04]  if this is not your faith,
[2498.12 --> 2498.98]  if you have not yet
[2498.98 --> 2499.90]  believed in Jesus,
[2500.40 --> 2501.52]  then we are grateful
[2501.52 --> 2503.52]  that you are joining us today,
[2503.52 --> 2505.10]  but we would just ask
[2505.10 --> 2506.12]  that you not partake
[2506.12 --> 2506.78]  at this time.
[2508.02 --> 2508.96]  But that you would
[2508.96 --> 2510.06]  in fact consider
[2510.06 --> 2511.06]  what Jesus has done
[2511.06 --> 2511.46]  for you.
[2511.74 --> 2512.54]  Jesus wants you
[2512.54 --> 2513.38]  to trust in him.
[2513.76 --> 2514.28]  He wants you
[2514.28 --> 2515.12]  to believe in him,
[2515.48 --> 2516.84]  to receive his gift
[2516.84 --> 2517.72]  of eternal life
[2517.72 --> 2518.62]  and forgiveness
[2518.62 --> 2519.28]  of sins.
[2519.28 --> 2519.40]  Jesus.
[2521.16 --> 2522.00]  And for all of us,
[2522.04 --> 2522.92]  this table
[2522.92 --> 2523.80]  is a time
[2523.80 --> 2525.26]  to look to Jesus
[2525.26 --> 2526.18]  in his death
[2526.18 --> 2527.70]  and his resurrection
[2527.70 --> 2528.74]  and for all of us
[2528.74 --> 2529.38]  to worship him.
[2531.14 --> 2532.18]  And so right now,
[2532.34 --> 2533.52]  I want to invite you
[2533.52 --> 2534.56]  into a time
[2534.56 --> 2535.32]  of meditation.
[2536.46 --> 2537.68]  We're going to have
[2537.68 --> 2538.78]  some music
[2538.78 --> 2541.04]  and it's also time
[2541.04 --> 2541.82]  for you to prepare
[2541.82 --> 2542.66]  your elements
[2542.66 --> 2543.24]  at home.
[2543.90 --> 2544.56]  And after that,
[2544.62 --> 2545.26]  I will lead you
[2545.26 --> 2546.06]  in taking the bread
[2546.06 --> 2546.88]  and the wine together.
[2576.06 --> 2606.04]  and the wine together.
[2606.06 --> 2607.10]  When the hour came,
[2607.98 --> 2609.38]  Jesus and his apostles
[2609.38 --> 2610.60]  reclined at the table.
[2611.76 --> 2613.10]  And he said to them,
[2613.22 --> 2614.54]  I have eagerly desired
[2614.54 --> 2615.66]  to eat this Passover
[2615.66 --> 2616.24]  with you
[2616.24 --> 2617.26]  before I suffer.
[2618.26 --> 2619.18]  For I tell you,
[2619.28 --> 2620.50]  I will not eat it again
[2620.50 --> 2622.70]  until it finds fulfillment
[2622.70 --> 2623.92]  in the kingdom of God.
[2625.42 --> 2626.80]  After taking the cup,
[2626.86 --> 2627.58]  he gave thanks
[2627.58 --> 2628.14]  and said,
[2628.52 --> 2629.34]  take this
[2629.34 --> 2630.52]  and divide it among you.
[2631.24 --> 2632.12]  For I tell you,
[2632.16 --> 2633.22]  I will not drink again
[2633.22 --> 2634.34]  from the fruit of the vine
[2634.34 --> 2636.06]  until the kingdom
[2636.06 --> 2636.96]  of God comes.
[2638.42 --> 2639.74]  And he took the bread,
[2640.24 --> 2640.90]  gave thanks
[2640.90 --> 2641.60]  and broke it
[2641.60 --> 2642.44]  and said to them,
[2642.54 --> 2643.68]  this is my body
[2643.68 --> 2645.20]  given for you.
[2646.24 --> 2646.92]  Do this
[2646.92 --> 2648.24]  in remembrance of me.
[2650.48 --> 2651.40]  The same way
[2651.40 --> 2652.24]  after supper,
[2653.08 --> 2654.04]  Jesus took the cup
[2654.04 --> 2654.36]  saying,
[2654.46 --> 2654.94]  this cup
[2654.94 --> 2655.96]  is the new covenant
[2655.96 --> 2657.64]  in my blood
[2657.64 --> 2659.52]  which is poured out
[2659.52 --> 2660.58]  for you.
[2660.58 --> 2663.50]  friends,
[2663.58 --> 2663.92]  Christ,
[2664.04 --> 2664.84]  our Passover
[2664.84 --> 2666.30]  has been sacrificed
[2666.30 --> 2667.02]  for us.
[2667.90 --> 2668.68]  These are the gifts
[2668.68 --> 2669.14]  of God
[2669.14 --> 2669.86]  for the people
[2669.86 --> 2670.58]  of God.
[2671.12 --> 2672.20]  I invite you now
[2672.20 --> 2674.08]  to feed on Christ
[2674.08 --> 2675.00]  in your hearts
[2675.00 --> 2676.36]  with thanksgiving
[2676.36 --> 2677.88]  and drink
[2677.88 --> 2678.42]  remembering
[2678.42 --> 2679.52]  that Christ's blood
[2679.52 --> 2680.40]  was shed for you.
[2682.28 --> 2683.24]  So friends,
[2683.72 --> 2684.88]  let's prepare
[2684.88 --> 2685.78]  to take the bread.
[2685.78 --> 2688.38]  this is the body
[2688.38 --> 2688.98]  of Christ
[2688.98 --> 2689.84]  broken for you.
[2711.50 --> 2713.16]  Take and drink
[2713.16 --> 2714.46]  the blood
[2714.46 --> 2715.10]  of Christ
[2715.10 --> 2716.56]  shed for you.
[2725.56 --> 2726.60]  Let's pray together.
[2728.96 --> 2729.44]  Father,
[2729.58 --> 2730.50]  we give you thanks
[2730.50 --> 2731.14]  and praise
[2731.14 --> 2732.40]  that we can build
[2732.40 --> 2733.18]  our hope
[2733.18 --> 2735.26]  on the solid foundation
[2735.26 --> 2736.58]  of Christ the Lord.
[2737.80 --> 2738.74]  We thank you,
[2738.94 --> 2739.00]  Lord,
[2739.10 --> 2739.98]  for this simple
[2739.98 --> 2741.76]  but costly meal.
[2741.76 --> 2743.28]  and we pray,
[2743.48 --> 2743.58]  Lord,
[2743.66 --> 2744.44]  that you would indeed
[2744.44 --> 2745.60]  use it to strengthen us
[2745.60 --> 2746.20]  for the life
[2746.20 --> 2747.14]  you've called us to.
[2748.04 --> 2749.08]  In Christ's name,
[2750.18 --> 2750.58]  Amen.
[2752.80 --> 2754.16]  So we will sing
[2754.16 --> 2755.42]  a final song together.
[2755.42 --> 2755.54]  Amen.
[2771.76 --> 2786.92]  I hear the Savior say,
[2786.92 --> 2791.56]  My strength in me is small,
[2791.56 --> 2794.18]  child of weakness,
[2794.46 --> 2796.42]  watch and play,
[2796.80 --> 2800.92]  find me behind all and all.
[2800.92 --> 2804.70]  Jesus made it all.
[2804.70 --> 2806.78]  Jesus made it all,
[2807.18 --> 2811.60]  all to him I owe.
[2812.42 --> 2814.40]  Sin and life,
[2814.52 --> 2816.58]  the crimson stain,
[2817.30 --> 2822.14]  he washed it by the snow.
[2822.14 --> 2829.56]  For nothing can I hide
[2829.56 --> 2834.06]  Whereby thy ways to claim
[2834.06 --> 2838.92]  I have washed my garments white
[2838.92 --> 2844.28]  In the blood of Calvary's land
[2844.28 --> 2849.38]  Jesus made it all
[2849.38 --> 2854.24]  All to them I owe
[2854.24 --> 2859.74]  Sin, a tenth and princess slain
[2859.74 --> 2865.64]  Being washed in my last stone
[2865.64 --> 2872.24]  And when before the throne
[2872.24 --> 2876.96]  I stand in him complete
[2876.96 --> 2881.94]  Jesus died my selfishness
[2881.94 --> 2887.32]  My lips shall still repeat
[2887.32 --> 2891.96]  Jesus made it all
[2892.66 --> 2896.96]  All to live my own
[2896.96 --> 2903.20]  Sin had left the princess slain
[2903.20 --> 2908.96]  He washed in my last stone
[2908.96 --> 2917.16]  And since the psalm has lain
[2917.16 --> 2947.14]  Thank you.
[2947.16 --> 2977.14]  Thank you.
