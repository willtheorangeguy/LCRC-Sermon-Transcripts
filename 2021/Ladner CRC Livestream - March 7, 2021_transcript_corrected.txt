[1949.50 → 1979.48] You know, you know,
[1979.50 → 2009.48] and you're in the Lord.
[2009.48 → 2039.46] that Jesus was, you know,
[2039.46 → 2069.44] I confess, you know, you're in the Lord.
[2069.44 → 2099.42] like me, you're in the Lord.
[2099.42 → 2129.40] He's in the Lord.
[2129.40 → 2159.40] And you're in the Lord.
[2159.40 → 2189.40] And you're in the Lord.
[2189.40 → 2219.40] And you're in the Lord.
[2219.40 → 2249.40] But you're in the Lord.
[2249.40 → 2279.40] And you're in the Lord.
[2279.40 → 2309.38] I want to do, you're in the Lord.
[2309.38 → 2339.38] And you're in the Lord.
[2339.38 → 2369.36] And you're in the Lord.
[2369.36 → 2399.34] And you're in the Lord.
[2399.34 → 2399.36] And you're in the Lord.
[2429.34 → 2459.34] And you're in the Lord.
[2459.34 → 2489.34] And you're in the Lord.
[2489.34 → 2491.34] And you're in the Lord.
[2491.34 → 2493.34] He's in the Lord.
[2493.34 → 2521.32] And you're in the Lord.
[2521.34 → 2522.34] It was in the Lord.
[2522.34 → 2523.34] It was in the Lord.
[2523.34 → 2551.32] And you're in the Lord.
[2551.32 → 2552.32] And you're in the Lord.
[2552.32 → 2553.32] And you're in the Lord.
[2553.32 → 2581.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2581.30 → 2583.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2583.30 → 2585.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2585.30 → 2587.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2587.30 → 2589.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2589.30 → 2590.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2590.30 → 2592.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2592.30 → 2593.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2593.30 → 2596.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2596.30 → 2598.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2598.30 → 2599.30] And you're in the Lord.
[2599.30 → 2604.04] The perfect righteous one for unrighteous guilty sinners.
[2605.22 → 2609.60] And Peter is telling us that on this central day of all history,
[2610.24 → 2614.32] at this central moment, what was happening was a transfer.
[2615.52 → 2622.40] God treated someone who was righteous as if he was unrighteous.
[2623.26 → 2625.96] Okay, so we need to talk about this for a bit.
[2625.96 → 2634.74] So this word righteous is a word in the New Testament that comes from the legal realm of life.
[2635.32 → 2638.68] Okay, it's talking about legal and justice.
[2639.22 → 2642.88] And it's actually a word that can be also translated as just, righteous or just.
[2643.68 → 2645.44] And it means to be right with the law.
[2646.42 → 2650.90] Or if you are unrighteous, you are not right with the law.
[2651.74 → 2654.92] To be right with the law then also means that you are free.
[2654.92 → 2657.08] Right, it has no claims on you.
[2657.64 → 2661.54] If you are not right with the law, it means that you owe something.
[2661.64 → 2662.60] There's a claim on you.
[2662.96 → 2664.18] Maybe you owe a fine.
[2664.84 → 2667.20] Or maybe you owe jail time.
[2667.68 → 2668.74] Or something like that.
[2668.80 → 2669.72] But you are not free.
[2671.06 → 2674.04] And what this verse tells us that Jesus was righteous.
[2674.78 → 2675.76] He was free.
[2676.38 → 2678.46] The law had no claim against him.
[2678.46 → 2679.38] We saw last time.
[2679.74 → 2682.08] The devil and death had no claim on him.
[2682.68 → 2688.14] But on the cross, God treated him as if he were unrighteous.
[2689.08 → 2694.20] And that means that our liabilities were transferred to him.
[2694.20 → 2700.02] So this week, I received one of those scam phone calls.
[2700.30 → 2701.28] You know, the ones.
[2702.14 → 2706.28] They left a voice message on my phone telling me I owed money to the CRA.
[2706.72 → 2707.90] Well, I've gotten these before.
[2708.34 → 2711.82] This time, they told me that there was a warrant out for my arrest.
[2711.82 → 2716.10] I just feel like that is extra, as we say.
[2716.48 → 2718.32] That's kind of escalating things.
[2719.42 → 2722.74] Anyway, so let's imagine that this is true.
[2723.28 → 2726.14] Let's imagine that the CRA is coming for you.
[2727.00 → 2731.72] And let's say that what you owe is twice what you have.
[2732.10 → 2734.22] You are in debt, and you can't pay.
[2735.36 → 2737.22] So you're telling one of your friends.
[2737.90 → 2739.46] And you tell her your problems.
[2739.46 → 2743.08] And she says, well, you know, I'm worth exactly what you owe.
[2743.86 → 2745.20] And I will pay it for you.
[2745.96 → 2746.80] That's a perfect friend.
[2747.68 → 2752.16] The CRA says, well, that's fine.
[2752.26 → 2753.08] We just want our money.
[2753.16 → 2754.26] We don't really care where it comes from.
[2754.82 → 2756.14] So they go to her.
[2756.68 → 2758.42] And they go in her house.
[2758.48 → 2759.86] They take the paintings off the wall.
[2760.72 → 2763.48] They take the jewellery from around her neck.
[2764.16 → 2765.96] They carry off the furniture.
[2766.30 → 2767.84] They throw her out on the street.
[2767.84 → 2768.96] And they sell the house.
[2769.46 → 2770.46] Empty her bank account.
[2771.68 → 2774.10] She was righteous tax-wise.
[2774.60 → 2774.74] Right?
[2775.00 → 2775.74] No debts.
[2775.98 → 2776.80] No liabilities.
[2777.68 → 2778.94] No claim on her.
[2779.08 → 2781.88] But she is treated as if she is unrighteous.
[2783.02 → 2785.62] Your debts have been transferred to her.
[2785.80 → 2788.20] And she's been wiped out to pay what you owe.
[2788.80 → 2792.36] And this is what the scripture says happened on the cross.
[2792.36 → 2794.30] There was a legal transfer.
[2794.30 → 2796.52] For Christ also suffered once for sins.
[2796.88 → 2798.50] The righteous for the unrighteous.
[2799.18 → 2800.34] To bring you to God.
[2801.42 → 2807.00] And so on of the many images that the Bible gives us for the cross, for the atonement, is substitution.
[2807.00 → 2810.80] Jesus was our substitute.
[2810.80 → 2813.98] He took all of our sin on himself on the cross.
[2814.32 → 2817.80] And standing in our place, he bore the judgment.
[2818.48 → 2820.42] So that our sin is paid for.
[2820.50 → 2821.00] It is gone.
[2821.06 → 2822.46] As far as the east is from the west.
[2822.54 → 2823.84] The debt has been paid.
[2824.22 → 2824.92] We are free.
[2824.92 → 2828.32] And now we are legally righteous.
[2829.58 → 2832.90] All of our sin, past, present, and future, has been forgiven.
[2833.68 → 2836.84] We are completely right in God's sight.
[2837.34 → 2839.28] We have fulfilled the law in Christ.
[2839.42 → 2847.98] We have lived the perfect life of our innocent Saviour who lived it for us and who gave us all the credit for it.
[2847.98 → 2856.98] So when we stand before God, God looks at us and sees us legally in the same way that he sees his perfect son.
[2858.68 → 2865.10] So that is one of the amazing things that happened on the cross as Jesus died.
[2865.92 → 2868.98] And that brings us to the third thing we see in this passage.
[2870.06 → 2873.80] So if Jesus bore our sins, well, what does that mean for us?
[2874.04 → 2874.94] What's the result?
[2874.94 → 2880.76] Christians tend to answer that our sins are forgiven.
[2881.94 → 2883.64] And that is true, right?
[2883.92 → 2887.60] But that is not how Peter says it here.
[2888.58 → 2897.48] Peter teaches that Jesus bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[2898.38 → 2902.14] That is, Jesus gives us a new kind of life.
[2902.14 → 2907.86] It's a life of putting sin to death because it no longer has claim over us.
[2908.28 → 2913.32] We are free to put sin aside, to not let it rule over us.
[2914.02 → 2916.42] And we're to be alive to righteousness.
[2916.66 → 2920.24] We have been made legally righteous, but now we can live that way.
[2921.26 → 2923.44] We can follow all that Jesus done.
[2923.52 → 2924.94] We can obey God's commands.
[2924.94 → 2928.70] And friends, this is so important.
[2929.76 → 2939.34] Because if we only use the language of our sins were forgiven, as important as that is, we are missing a part of our identity and our life in Christ.
[2940.04 → 2942.22] Because, you know, Christians will often ask this.
[2943.06 → 2946.44] Why should I stop sinning when I know that God will forgive me?
[2946.44 → 2949.72] People ask that question all the time, too much.
[2950.58 → 2952.04] You may have asked it before.
[2952.20 → 2953.14] I certainly have.
[2954.36 → 2956.68] The question makes a certain kind of sense.
[2957.70 → 2963.24] But only if the atonement only means that Jesus died on the cross so that I can be forgiven of my sins.
[2963.92 → 2969.18] But when we understand what Peter is saying here, the question is revealed as complete nonsense.
[2969.18 → 2976.52] The answer to the question is, why should I stop sinning because Jesus has forgiven me?
[2976.68 → 2982.66] The answer is because Jesus bore our sins on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[2983.96 → 2989.70] And so now the question is revealed as completely against the purpose of the cross.
[2991.22 → 2994.90] So in this substitution, we are not merely forgiven.
[2995.42 → 2997.12] We are changed.
[2997.24 → 2998.70] We are made new.
[2999.18 → 3005.22] And so, friends, the minute you turn to Christ in faith, you are justified.
[3005.48 → 3006.54] You are made right with God.
[3007.20 → 3009.30] You are legally righteous.
[3010.06 → 3016.12] But also the Spirit of God, like a seed, put into your heart.
[3016.24 → 3017.84] He lives in your heart.
[3018.38 → 3023.28] He comes into your life with his love and with gratitude for what Jesus has done.
[3023.40 → 3026.14] And you begin to grow into actual righteousness.
[3026.14 → 3034.38] And so we say that the gospel accepts us as we are, but it doesn't leave us as we are.
[3035.10 → 3035.54] Right?
[3035.66 → 3041.72] And so on our church website, it says, no matter who you are or where you come from, you are welcome here.
[3041.72 → 3044.48] That is the invitation of the gospel.
[3044.48 → 3048.82] That we don't need to clean ourselves up to come to God.
[3048.82 → 3055.60] God came down in his love while we were still sinners and enemies of God to give his life for us.
[3055.60 → 3063.10] So we come to Jesus sinful, unrighteous, empty-handed, with nothing to commend ourselves to God.
[3064.16 → 3067.48] And we come to him, and we are forgiven by his grace.
[3067.48 → 3075.18] And friends, as a church, people are welcome to come here because they are sinners just like we are.
[3076.92 → 3079.90] But that doesn't mean we stay that way.
[3080.34 → 3083.24] Every single one of us has to change.
[3084.18 → 3089.80] So theologically speaking, we can separate justification, being made as righteous and just in God's sight,
[3089.80 → 3095.88] from sanctification, the actual experience of living that way and growing in Christ.
[3095.88 → 3102.36] These two things can be thought of separately, but here in reality, they are never at odds with one another.
[3104.00 → 3108.24] But when we have a narrow view of the atonement, we end up with nonsense.
[3108.68 → 3112.58] Like pitting being made righteous against living righteously.
[3112.58 → 3121.56] But Jesus bore our sins on the cross so that we might die to sin and to live to righteousness.
[3124.26 → 3129.04] The second image Peter gives us for our salvation is in verse 25.
[3129.92 → 3137.16] For you are like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
[3137.82 → 3140.70] And I think this is a great picture of our problem as humans.
[3140.70 → 3145.38] It tells us that not only are we sinners, but we are wanderers.
[3146.48 → 3148.84] We stray away from God who loves us.
[3149.88 → 3156.36] We are made for fellowship and relationship with God, but we foolishly wander away.
[3157.70 → 3160.02] But God in his love has pursued you.
[3160.56 → 3165.60] He has sent his son, our shepherd, to find us and to bring us back home.
[3165.60 → 3170.78] And God longs for you to come and to know him, to receive his life.
[3171.76 → 3174.86] But in order to do that, you must trust Jesus with your life.
[3175.44 → 3176.76] You must give him your life.
[3177.02 → 3180.40] And in order to give him your life, you must stop wandering.
[3181.52 → 3183.24] And I've heard it put like this.
[3183.24 → 3188.04] So a man would take his trash out to the garbage bins outside.
[3189.72 → 3196.40] And so he would be holding the trash bags in both hands and heading out the door to bring the garbage outside.
[3197.10 → 3201.24] And one time as he was getting the trash and his hands were full, he was leaving the kitchen.
[3201.24 → 3206.68] And his wife said with impeccable timing, hey, give me a kiss.
[3208.00 → 3215.90] So he tried to, holding the trash bags, kind of turned his head and lean over and give her a kiss while holding the trash bags.
[3215.94 → 3221.58] And she said, no, put the trash down, turn around, and give me a kiss.
[3223.12 → 3225.80] And that is what repentance and faith looks like.
[3226.28 → 3228.54] You've got to put the trash down.
[3228.54 → 3230.90] All the things that you're holding on to.
[3231.20 → 3235.68] And you've got to turn around and embrace Christ.
[3237.18 → 3245.52] And so when we repent, and we turn back, we find that our wounds of sin have been healed, as Peter says.
[3246.24 → 3250.18] We have a shepherd who loves us and who cares for us.
[3250.50 → 3256.54] And we find that this shepherd is the same one who bore our sins on the cross.
[3256.54 → 3261.12] So friends, please join me in prayer.
[3265.28 → 3276.78] Father, we ask that you would open our eyes, as you open the eyes of the apostles, to see the cross for what you accomplished for us.
[3276.78 → 3279.94] Father, you bore our sins.
[3279.94 → 3281.54] You healed our wounds.
[3282.32 → 3284.28] You have given us your righteousness.
[3285.12 → 3289.18] And you have given us your life so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[3289.56 → 3293.12] And Lord, we ask for your help to live in light of the cross.
[3293.50 → 3297.72] To live out this life that you have accomplished for us, for your glory.
[3297.72 → 3303.90] We pray for your help and through the Holy Spirit's grace and work within us.
[3304.34 → 3305.54] In Jesus Christ we pray.
[3306.16 → 3306.46] Amen.
[3307.56 → 3311.40] So we will sing our song of response together.
[3311.40 → 3336.46] Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day.
[3336.46 → 3342.46] Christ on the road to glory.
[3342.46 → 3343.46] Christ on the road to glory.
[3343.46 → 3347.30] Tried by sinful men.
[3347.30 → 3350.46] Torn and beaten glen.
[3350.46 → 3356.78] Nailed to a cross of word.
[3356.78 → 3363.46] It is the power of the cross.
[3363.46 → 3370.46] Christ began sin for us.
[3370.46 → 3376.86] To the blame for the wrath.
[3376.86 → 3383.52] We stand forgiven at the cross.
[3383.52 → 3388.82] To the blame for the wrath.
[3388.82 → 3396.90] Oh, to see the pain written on your face.
[3396.90 → 3403.76] Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
[3404.24 → 3406.82] Every bitter thought.
[3407.68 → 3410.82] Every evil deed.
[3411.30 → 3415.74] Rounding your blood-stained crown.
[3415.74 → 3422.74] Is the power of the cross.
[3422.74 → 3430.82] Christ became sin for us.
[3430.82 → 3436.32] To the blame for the wrath.
[3436.74 → 3441.74] We stand forgiven at the cross.
[3441.74 → 3450.74] Now the daylight flees.
[3450.74 → 3454.74] Now the ground beneath.
[3454.74 → 3457.74] Wakes as its maker.
[3457.74 → 3460.74] Blast his fair.
[3460.74 → 3461.74] Good to toil and tear.
[3461.74 → 3464.74] Good to toil and tear.
[3464.74 → 3467.74] Then erase life.
[3467.74 → 3473.74] Finish your victory pride.
[3473.74 → 3480.74] It is the power of the cross.
[3480.74 → 3487.74] Rightly came sin for us.
[3487.74 → 3490.74] To the blame.
[3490.74 → 3491.74] O'er the wrath.
[3491.74 → 3493.74] O'er the wrath.
[3493.74 → 3497.74] We stand forgiven at the cross.
[3497.74 → 3504.74] O'er the wrath.
[3504.74 → 3505.74] The Holy blood shall obey God.
[3505.74 → 3507.74] God struct time.
[3507.74 → 3508.74] That every mess of no stopping.
[3508.74 → 3508.96] They are the wrath.
[3509.74 → 3510.74] Maybe behind the vision.
[3510.74 → 3511.74] All protection.
[3511.74 → 3512.74] Therefore to the CHRISTOPH Circle march.
[3512.74 → 3519.54] For through your suffering I am free
[3519.54 → 3523.60] Death is crushed to death
[3523.60 → 3527.00] Life is mine to live
[3527.00 → 3532.78] Long through your selfless blood
[3532.78 → 3539.78] Is the power of the most
[3539.78 → 3546.62] Son of God, sing for us
[3546.62 → 3551.94] Blood alive, Mara-Cost
[3551.94 → 3559.80] We stand forgiven at the cross
[3569.78 → 3574.16] Before we join in prayer
[3574.16 → 3576.86] I would like to mention that we learned this week
[3576.86 → 3578.00] That Bill Vital
[3578.00 → 3580.20] The former member of this congregation
[3580.20 → 3582.24] The husband of Henry Vital
[3582.24 → 3585.92] And brother to John, Harry, Tony, Jenny Burma
[3585.92 → 3589.08] Has left us to be with the Lord this past week
[3589.08 → 3591.76] And so we want to hold the Vital family in our hearts
[3591.76 → 3594.00] And prayers as they grieve Bill
[3594.00 → 3596.86] Let's pray
[3596.86 → 3603.68] Father, we thank you for the time we could spend together this morning
[3603.68 → 3605.12] As a gathering of your people
[3605.12 → 3608.78] You are great and glorious and eternal
[3608.78 → 3611.34] And it's good to spend time worshipping you
[3611.34 → 3613.30] Both with song and word
[3613.30 → 3616.78] Thank you also for the message from Pastor Jason
[3616.78 → 3622.20] And the reminder of the tremendous sacrifice of substitution that Jesus made for us
[3622.20 → 3625.74] And the life-changing effects that this gift has on our lives
[3625.74 → 3629.78] We thank you also for the changing seasons
[3629.78 → 3633.88] And reminders of spring as days get longer and flowers bloom
[3633.88 → 3637.08] Your creation is amazing and beautiful
[3637.08 → 3639.78] And we praise and thank you for it
[3639.78 → 3643.56] Lord, we also have petitions to bring before you
[3643.56 → 3645.56] Knowing that you have promised to hear them
[3645.56 → 3648.38] Please guide us as a congregation
[3648.38 → 3650.72] As we consider changing the name of our church
[3650.72 → 3654.16] Within the context of how best can we serve you
[3654.16 → 3656.46] Within a changing community and society
[3656.46 → 3660.66] Please also bless Pastor Nancy's ministry work
[3660.66 → 3664.24] Even with the challenges of isolation brought on by the pandemic
[3664.24 → 3665.60] She is reaching many people
[3665.60 → 3668.74] And we praise you for the baptisms we can look forward to at Easter
[3668.74 → 3673.54] We thank you for organizations like the Canadian Food Grains Bank
[3673.54 → 3675.90] We pray that with continued support
[3675.90 → 3679.44] They can continue the work of bringing short and long-term help
[3679.44 → 3680.52] To those facing hunger
[3680.52 → 3685.04] We also pray for healing for those struggling with illness
[3685.04 → 3687.58] Please be near John Ram
[3687.58 → 3689.38] Who has cancer of the blood
[3689.38 → 3691.84] And comfort him and Janet and the family
[3691.84 → 3693.28] As they consider next steps
[3693.28 → 3696.36] We pray for your healing hand
[3696.36 → 3697.90] And your wisdom and peace
[3697.90 → 3699.20] To rest on Annie Ran
[3699.20 → 3700.10] My mother
[3700.10 → 3702.78] As she faces the recurrence of cancer
[3702.78 → 3704.54] In her lymph nodes
[3704.54 → 3715.38] And faces the decisions around treatment options
[3715.38 → 3721.12] We continue to pray for Kim and George Kulun
[3721.12 → 3724.30] May your peace rest on them and their families
[3724.30 → 3726.66] Please be near John Vital
[3726.66 → 3727.66] Greg Vital
[3727.66 → 3729.14] Julie Belly
[3729.14 → 3730.70] And Pat Barman
[3730.70 → 3731.88] As they face illnesses
[3731.88 → 3739.30] Excuse me
[3739.30 → 3746.56] As they face illnesses that are greatly impacting their daily lives
[3746.56 → 3749.80] We pray for healing for each of these brothers and sisters
[3749.80 → 3753.00] Peace me with Henry and Henry Multivane
[3753.00 → 3755.56] With Henry's transition to a care residence in Langley
[3755.56 → 3757.84] It's a difficult transition
[3757.84 → 3758.88] Made even more so
[3758.88 → 3760.70] With limited visiting possible
[3760.70 → 3767.32] We pray also for those planning and executing the COVID vaccine
[3767.32 → 3770.24] Roll out over the coming months
[3770.24 → 3773.30] It's easy to get caught up in the optimism
[3773.30 → 3774.38] As weather improves
[3774.38 → 3776.82] And the end of this pandemic is coming into view
[3776.82 → 3780.18] But we pray that we can still be patient
[3780.18 → 3783.46] And continue efforts to minimize the impact of this virus
[3783.46 → 3786.24] As we wait for the vaccine efforts to make an impact
[3786.24 → 3791.98] We also want to remember regions of the world where violence continues
[3791.98 → 3795.80] Afghanistan in particular is facing a crossroads
[3795.80 → 3798.38] With the pending withdrawal of American forces
[3798.38 → 3801.76] And a precarious peace deal
[3801.76 → 3803.20] Between the Taliban
[3803.20 → 3813.12] Excuse me
[3813.12 → 3819.30] The pending withdrawal of American forces
[3819.30 → 3820.48] And a precarious peace deal
[3820.48 → 3821.82] Between the Taliban and the government
[3821.82 → 3823.88] Threatened by targeted killings
[3823.88 → 3825.18] And the re-emergence of ISIS
[3825.18 → 3827.34] We pray for your intervention
[3827.34 → 3829.18] In this complicated and troubled region
[3829.18 → 3830.74] Please bring wisdom
[3830.74 → 3832.90] And vision to those involved
[3832.90 → 3834.00] That they can forge a future
[3834.00 → 3835.78] That doesn't include extreme violence
[3835.78 → 3838.98] Be near us, Lord, through this coming week
[3838.98 → 3841.60] Help us to be effective servants to you
[3841.60 → 3843.60] And that the focus of our lives
[3843.60 → 3844.60] Is to give you glory
[3844.60 → 3846.04] And advance your kingdom
[3846.04 → 3848.88] Thank you for hearing our prayers, Lord
[3848.88 → 3849.42] Amen
[3849.42 → 3867.16] So having brought our needs
[3867.16 → 3870.84] Our requests before the Lord who hears us
[3870.84 → 3873.78] We entrust our request to him
[3873.78 → 3878.14] And so now we complete our worship service
[3878.14 → 3881.34] We go from here with God's words upon us
[3881.34 → 3882.02] His blessing
[3882.02 → 3884.38] So I invite you to hold out your hands
[3884.38 → 3887.22] Receive the Lord's blessing
[3887.22 → 3890.88] Now may the God of peace himself
[3890.88 → 3892.90] Sanctify you completely
[3892.90 → 3895.70] And may your whole spirit, soul, and body
[3895.70 → 3897.22] Be kept blameless at the coming
[3897.22 → 3899.04] Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3899.04 → 3901.58] He who calls you is faithful
[3901.58 → 3904.16] He will surely do it
[3904.16 → 3905.88] Amen
[3905.88 → 3909.08] So we'll sing our final song
[3909.08 → 3910.80] Together
[3910.80 → 3912.06] Take my life and let it be
[3912.06 → 3929.12] Take my life and let it be
[3929.12 → 3934.26] God's secret and Lord to thee
[3934.26 → 3939.78] Take my promise and my days
[3939.78 → 3945.02] Let them flow in endless grace
[3945.02 → 3951.14] Let them flow in endless grace
[3951.14 → 3957.40] Take my will and make it thine
[3957.40 → 3962.44] It shall be no longer mine
[3962.44 → 3967.68] Take my heart, it is thine all
[3967.68 → 3972.92] It shall be thine royal throne
[3972.92 → 3979.04] It shall be thine royal throne
[3979.04 → 3985.42] Take my land and load thy poor
[3985.42 → 3991.08] And thy feet which treasure star
[3991.08 → 3996.32] Take my self and I will be
[3996.32 → 3996.64] Take my self and I will be
[3996.64 → 4002.18] Ever only all for thee
[4002.18 → 4008.08] Ever only all for thee
[4008.08 → 4027.36] Now may you
