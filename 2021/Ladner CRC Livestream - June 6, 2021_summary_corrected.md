• The psalms were meant to be sung while travelling, but often they are more about dissatisfaction than excitement.
• Dissatisfaction with life can lead people to seek God and follow the path of discipleship.
• Eugene Peterson's book A Long Obedience in the Same Direction discusses how dissatisfaction is a key motivator for faith.
• The psalmist is dissatisfied with living in a broken world and its effects on people.
• There's a longing for peace as a response to this brokenness.

• The psalmist faces distress due to being surrounded by stories that contradict God's truth.

• Psalm 120 is used as an example, highlighting its significance as a reminder of our need for faith and truth in a broken world
• The journey of faith begins with a decision to take one path over another, seeking what is true and good in God
• Living in a broken world causes distress, but the response to this distress is a longing for peace
• This longing for peace begins with prayer, as seen in Psalm 120 where the speaker calls out to the Lord in their distress and receives an answer
• The importance of prayer and going to God in times of distress
• Deliverance from anxiety and feeling trapped by enemies' words
• Deliverance from the need to take vengeance against enemies
• Punishment for enemies through divine intervention (using warrior's arrows and burning coals)
• The psalmist is not seeking revenge against his enemies

• Justice and peace of God found in Jesus
• The weight of sin and deception from the world was poured out on Jesus
