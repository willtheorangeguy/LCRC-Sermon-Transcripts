[62.44 --> 64.44]  Amen.
[92.44 --> 94.44]  Amen.
[122.44 --> 124.44]  Amen.
[152.44 --> 154.44]  Amen.
[182.44 --> 184.44]  Amen.
[212.44 --> 214.44]  Amen.
[242.44 --> 244.44]  Amen.

[332.44 --> 334.44]  Amen.
[334.44 --> 339.08]  here this morning and a special welcome if you're visiting with us this morning. It's
[339.08 --> 346.56]  certainly a blessing to have you amongst us. I'm happy to announce that after this service,
[346.74 --> 353.68]  everyone is invited to stick around for some coffee or tea or juice. And as exciting as
[353.68 --> 357.96]  that is, free coffee isn't the only reason to stick around after the service. Of course,
[357.96 --> 363.56]  it's all about fellowship. We'll get this thing dialed in. That's okay.
[364.44 --> 373.32]  It's all about fellowship and it's an opportunity to get together and to ease that a little bit,
[373.56 --> 377.84]  we're going to add a little twist today where there'll be some name tags that you can make
[377.84 --> 383.42]  up for yourself on the two hallways leading to the coffee hall. So you're encouraged to stop by there,
[383.52 --> 388.06]  take the pen and write your name on the tag. And it's the honor system, folks, so make sure you put
[388.06 --> 396.00]  your own name on the tag. So don't mess with me. It's a good opportunity to make sure that we know
[396.00 --> 399.86]  each other. It's been a while. And if you're like me, I have a tough time with names. So you can just
[399.86 --> 403.46]  reduce some barriers and take some awkwardness out of conversations. And it's a great way to meet
[403.46 --> 410.94]  somebody new. So with Pastor Jason and his family on vacation until August 10th, we have the opportunity
[410.94 --> 416.82]  to welcome many different guest speakers. And today we have Pastor Theo Lauder in our midst today. So
[416.82 --> 422.06]  we'll look forward to hearing from him a bit later. And just a word about Pastor Theo. He serves as the
[422.06 --> 427.62]  pastor at Christ Covenant Church in Langley. And he's also the director of mentorship and community
[427.62 --> 433.08]  development at Servants Anonymous Foundation in Vancouver. So Pastor Theo will share a few words
[433.08 --> 440.90]  about that a bit later. Very worthwhile cause, that one. And lastly, as before, we will not be passing
[440.90 --> 447.56]  any collection plates around in the service. But any donations made in the boxes in the foyer or
[447.56 --> 452.32]  online, we have various means of doing it. But those donations will go toward our Deakin Help Fund,
[452.74 --> 458.36]  which is a fund our deacons can use at their discretion to help those within and without our
[458.36 --> 467.98]  community with financial needs. So God greets us. And God calls us to worship him with these words
[467.98 --> 477.98]  from Psalm 95. Come, bow down in worship. Kneel to the Lord our Maker. This is our God, our Shepherd.
[478.82 --> 485.68]  We are the flock led with care. Let's take a moment to stand up, greet each other, and following that,
[485.68 --> 487.68]  our praise team will lead us in a collection of songs.
[515.68 --> 517.68]  That's why we should connect.
[517.68 --> 534.04]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our King. Make known the power of his grace, the beauty of his peace.
[534.04 --> 545.66]  Remember how his mercy reached and we cried out to him. He lifted us to our feet.
[545.66 --> 551.54]  To freedom from my sin
[551.54 --> 555.88]  Oh sing my song
[555.88 --> 560.04]  And tell all he's done
[560.04 --> 565.90]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory
[565.90 --> 573.22]  Lift high the name of Jesus
[573.22 --> 577.46]  Of Jesus our Lord
[577.46 --> 581.98]  His power in us is greater than
[581.98 --> 586.08]  Is greater than this world
[586.08 --> 590.02]  To share the reason for
[590.02 --> 594.86]  To serve with other grace
[594.86 --> 599.60]  That all who sing and shine through us
[599.60 --> 603.84]  I bring the Father's praise
[603.84 --> 608.36]  Oh sing my song
[608.36 --> 612.36]  And tell all he's done
[612.36 --> 617.84]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory
[617.84 --> 625.96]  Lift high the name of Jesus
[625.96 --> 630.34]  Of Jesus our light
[630.34 --> 635.04]  No other name on earth can sing
[635.04 --> 639.10]  And raise us still to light
[639.10 --> 643.34]  He opens up our eyes to sing
[643.34 --> 647.58]  The harvest he has grown
[647.58 --> 652.76]  We labor in his fields and grace
[652.76 --> 655.64]  As healing sinners
[655.64 --> 661.34]  Oh sing my song
[661.34 --> 665.68]  And tell all he's done
[665.68 --> 671.34]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory
[671.34 --> 677.58]  Sing my song
[677.58 --> 681.84]  And tell all he's done
[681.84 --> 687.84]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory
[687.84 --> 707.84]  Come thou fount of every blessing
[707.84 --> 712.38]  Tune my heart to sing thy grace
[712.38 --> 717.10]  Streams of mercy never ceasing
[717.10 --> 721.48]  All for songs of loudest praise
[721.48 --> 723.84]  Teach me a song
[723.84 --> 726.50]  And early sonnet
[726.50 --> 728.60]  Song by singing
[728.60 --> 730.82]  Tune's a prayer
[730.82 --> 733.28]  Praise and mount
[733.28 --> 736.02]  I'm fixed upon it
[736.02 --> 740.90]  Mount of gods and changing love
[740.90 --> 747.64]  Here I find my greatest treasure
[747.64 --> 748.64]  Together my heart to sing
[748.64 --> 749.64]  Together my heart to sing
[749.64 --> 750.64]  Together my heart to sing
[750.64 --> 751.64]  Together my heart to sing
[751.64 --> 757.02]  And I hope by thy good pleasure
[757.02 --> 760.64]  Safely to a heart to sing
[760.64 --> 767.02]  Jesus saw me when a stranger
[767.02 --> 771.64]  Would you love me of heaven and heaven
[771.64 --> 777.02]  Lead to rescue me from danger
[777.02 --> 782.40]  Little boast his precious blood
[782.40 --> 790.04]  O to grace how great a debtor
[790.04 --> 794.40]  Daily I'm constrained to be
[794.40 --> 799.78]  Let thy goodness like a bitter
[799.78 --> 805.14]  Find my wandering heart to thee
[805.14 --> 810.60]  Won't you wonder Lord I feel it
[810.60 --> 815.60]  Won't you leave the ground not alone
[815.60 --> 821.06]  Is my heart alone taken sealant
[821.06 --> 823.52]  Seal it for thy consent
[823.52 --> 826.90]  I can't stop by
[826.90 --> 829.10]  You are my strength when I am weak
[829.10 --> 834.48]  You are my strength when I am weak
[834.48 --> 842.12]  You are the treasure that I seek
[842.12 --> 847.50]  You are my all in all
[847.50 --> 853.50]  Seeking you as a precious tool
[853.50 --> 858.50]  Lord to give up I be a fool
[858.50 --> 863.88]  You are my all in all
[863.88 --> 864.88]  You are my all in all
[864.88 --> 867.88]  Seeking you as a precious tool
[867.88 --> 871.52]  Lord to give up I be a fool
[871.52 --> 874.88]  You are my all in all
[874.88 --> 880.26]  Jesus
[880.26 --> 881.26]  Jesus
[881.26 --> 885.26]  Lamb of God
[885.26 --> 891.26]  All is your name
[891.26 --> 894.26]  Jesus
[894.26 --> 898.26]  Lamb of God
[898.26 --> 899.26]  Lamb of God
[899.26 --> 905.26]  Lord is your name
[905.26 --> 906.26]  Lord is your name
[906.26 --> 909.26]  Lord is your name
[909.26 --> 913.26]  Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
[913.26 --> 916.64]  Rising again I bless your name
[916.64 --> 919.26]  You are my all in all
[919.26 --> 921.26]  All in all
[921.26 --> 929.26]  When I fall down you pick me up
[929.26 --> 933.26]  When I am dry you fill my cup
[933.26 --> 939.26]  You are my all in all
[939.26 --> 943.26]  Jesus
[943.26 --> 947.26]  Lamb of God
[947.26 --> 954.26]  Holy is your name
[954.26 --> 959.26]  Jesus
[959.26 --> 964.26]  Lamb of God
[964.26 --> 970.26]  Holy is your name
[970.26 --> 974.26]  Jesus
[974.26 --> 981.26]  Lamb of God
[981.26 --> 985.26]  Holy is your name
[985.26 --> 987.26]  Jesus
[987.26 --> 989.26]  Lamb of God
[989.26 --> 992.26]  Holy is your name
[993.26 --> 994.26]  Jesus
[994.26 --> 996.26]  Lamb of God
[996.26 --> 999.26]  Holy is your name
[999.26 --> 1000.26]  Jesus
[1000.26 --> 1007.26]  Holy is your name.
[1017.26 --> 1019.26]  Please be seated.
[1023.26 --> 1025.26]  When we come into the holy presence of God,
[1025.26 --> 1028.26]  our own humanity is laid bare.
[1028.26 --> 1031.26]  When we stand in the living presence of truth,
[1031.26 --> 1033.26]  our own falsehood is revealed.
[1033.26 --> 1036.26]  People of God, let's acknowledge who we are
[1036.26 --> 1039.26]  and ask our ever-present God to forgive us.
[1039.26 --> 1041.26]  Please join me in prayer.
[1043.26 --> 1046.26]  Awesome and compassionate God,
[1046.26 --> 1050.26]  you have loved us with unfailing, self-giving mercy,
[1050.26 --> 1052.26]  but we have not loved you.
[1052.26 --> 1056.26]  You constantly call us, but we do not listen.
[1056.26 --> 1059.26]  You ask us to love, but we walk away from neighbors in need,
[1059.26 --> 1061.26]  wrapped in our own concerns.
[1061.26 --> 1066.26]  We condone evil, prejudice, warfare, and greed.
[1066.26 --> 1069.26]  God of grace, as you come to us in mercy,
[1069.26 --> 1072.26]  we repent in spirit and in truth,
[1072.26 --> 1075.26]  admit our sin, and gratefully receive your forgiveness
[1075.26 --> 1078.26]  through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.
[1078.26 --> 1079.26]  Amen.
[1079.26 --> 1084.26]  To all who turn from sin in sorrow,
[1084.26 --> 1087.26]  to all who turn to God in hope,
[1087.26 --> 1089.26]  this is God's word of grace.
[1089.26 --> 1094.26]  We are accepted, we are forgiven, we are loved.
[1094.26 --> 1098.26]  This gift we have from God, thanks be to God.
[1098.26 --> 1101.26]  Let's sing, Lord, I need you.
[1101.26 --> 1106.26]  Lord, I come, I confess, bowing here, I find my rest.
[1106.26 --> 1108.26]  Without you, I fall upon you,
[1108.26 --> 1113.26]  I find my rest.
[1113.26 --> 1115.26]  Without you, I fall upon you,
[1115.26 --> 1116.26]  You're the one that guides my rest.
[1116.26 --> 1118.26]  Without you, I fall upon you,
[1118.26 --> 1119.26]  You're the one that guides my rest.
[1119.26 --> 1123.26]  I confess, I confess, I confess,
[1123.26 --> 1126.26]  Bowing here, I find my rest.
[1126.26 --> 1129.26]  Without you, I fall upon you,
[1129.26 --> 1132.26]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[1132.26 --> 1137.26]  Without you, I fall upon you,
[1137.26 --> 1142.26]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[1142.26 --> 1157.26]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[1157.26 --> 1164.26]  Every hour I need you.
[1164.26 --> 1172.26]  From my wild defense, my righteousness,
[1172.26 --> 1178.26]  O God, how I need you.
[1182.26 --> 1190.26]  Where sin has deep, your grace is born,
[1190.26 --> 1198.26]  When grace is found, is where you are.
[1198.26 --> 1205.26]  When you are, Lord, I am free.
[1205.26 --> 1213.26]  And loathiness is Christ in me.
[1213.26 --> 1223.26]  Lord, I need you.
[1223.26 --> 1228.26]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you.
[1228.26 --> 1242.30]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1242.30 --> 1250.30]  Every hour I need you
[1250.30 --> 1257.14]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1257.14 --> 1263.80]  Oh, God, how I need you
[1263.80 --> 1275.14]  So teach my song to rise to you
[1275.14 --> 1282.14]  When temptation comes my way
[1282.14 --> 1288.80]  When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1288.80 --> 1295.64]  Jesus, you're my home instead
[1295.64 --> 1302.30]  When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[1302.30 --> 1310.30]  Jesus, you're my home instead
[1310.30 --> 1322.96]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[1322.96 --> 1330.96]  Every hour I need you
[1330.96 --> 1338.62]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1338.62 --> 1345.28]  Oh, God, how I need you
[1345.28 --> 1354.50]  My one defense, my righteousness
[1354.50 --> 1361.16]  Oh, God, how I need you
[1361.16 --> 1374.88]  This time all those grades three through grade
[1374.88 --> 1377.04]  or ages three through grade seven
[1377.04 --> 1379.70]  are welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School.
[1379.70 --> 1384.34]  Also at this point, it's my pleasure
[1384.34 --> 1386.94]  to invite Pastor Theo to come forward
[1386.94 --> 1388.40]  and he's going to lead us in exploring
[1388.40 --> 1390.18]  a bit about the book of Ephesians
[1390.18 --> 1392.02]  So God's blessings on you, Theo,
[1392.14 --> 1393.86]  as you open God's word with us
[1393.86 --> 1409.90]  Thank you very much, Jake
[1409.90 --> 1411.62]  It's very good to be with you
[1411.62 --> 1414.52]  the Saints at Ladner CRC
[1414.52 --> 1415.86]  this morning
[1415.86 --> 1420.10]  It's been a while
[1420.10 --> 1423.84]  but it's very good to see you all again
[1423.84 --> 1426.08]  I want to bring you greetings
[1426.08 --> 1429.04]  from your brothers and sisters
[1429.04 --> 1430.66]  at Christ Covenant Church in Langley
[1430.66 --> 1433.80]  but I also especially want to bring you greetings
[1433.80 --> 1437.54]  from my fellow directors and staff
[1437.54 --> 1438.76]  at the SA Foundation
[1438.76 --> 1440.84]  Servants Anonymous Foundation in Vancouver
[1440.84 --> 1444.98]  We're so grateful for your ongoing support
[1444.98 --> 1447.88]  Every once in a while we get a check in the mail
[1447.88 --> 1449.02]  from Ladner CRC
[1449.02 --> 1450.90]  That's always a wonderful surprise
[1450.90 --> 1453.68]  and as our founder would always do
[1453.68 --> 1455.96]  when receiving a gift like that
[1455.96 --> 1457.10]  in the mail, she'd say
[1457.10 --> 1458.82]  We have to do the mula mula dance
[1458.82 --> 1462.16]  She was a lovely French lady
[1462.16 --> 1462.68]  and she said
[1462.68 --> 1464.32]  We have to do the mula mula dance
[1464.32 --> 1469.18]  Sadly, it just struck me this morning
[1469.18 --> 1471.60]  as we were entering worship
[1471.60 --> 1473.48]  that it's exactly three months ago
[1473.48 --> 1476.50]  that the Lord took our founder Dominique
[1476.50 --> 1477.30]  to himself
[1477.30 --> 1479.82]  We're grieving her loss
[1479.82 --> 1482.58]  She founded the organization
[1482.58 --> 1484.18]  over 30 years ago
[1484.18 --> 1488.76]  and she literally gave her life
[1488.76 --> 1491.50]  for the women and children
[1491.50 --> 1492.92]  that she served
[1492.92 --> 1497.36]  well over, I think the number was 6,000 worldwide
[1497.36 --> 1502.74]  But she trained us well
[1502.74 --> 1505.90]  She knew that her time on earth
[1505.90 --> 1507.56]  was not forever
[1507.56 --> 1509.32]  So she trained us
[1509.32 --> 1512.72]  all as fellow directors and staff
[1512.72 --> 1515.52]  So we're able to carry on the work
[1515.52 --> 1517.12]  So I want to assure you that
[1517.12 --> 1519.46]  in spite of the fact that she's no longer with us
[1519.46 --> 1520.80]  the work goes on
[1520.80 --> 1523.48]  And even through the time of COVID
[1523.48 --> 1525.06]  God has been very good to us
[1525.06 --> 1527.92]  We were able to keep all our programs going
[1527.92 --> 1531.24]  The program in Vancouver is still running strong
[1531.24 --> 1533.68]  And our global programs as well
[1533.68 --> 1536.58]  We're able to continue by God's grace
[1536.58 --> 1540.90]  And in spite of the challenges related to COVID
[1540.90 --> 1542.48]  God has been very good to us
[1542.48 --> 1545.66]  In fact, during this time
[1545.66 --> 1548.66]  we were even able to train a team in Italy
[1548.66 --> 1552.38]  So we're hoping that a program will be opening in Italy
[1552.38 --> 1555.88]  by January of 2022
[1555.88 --> 1560.40]  And they're already talking about opening two more programs in Italy
[1560.40 --> 1562.30]  as soon as they can
[1562.30 --> 1565.14]  So praise God for his wonderful work
[1565.14 --> 1569.28]  And again, I want to thank you very much for your ongoing support
[1569.28 --> 1574.38]  I was told that there will be a collection for the SA Foundation on August the 10th
[1575.08 --> 1578.46]  And so we thank you in advance for your generosity
[1578.46 --> 1581.24]  for your support, for your prayers
[1581.24 --> 1586.56]  Because ultimately it's about the women and children
[1586.56 --> 1590.14]  that we're serving
[1590.14 --> 1593.28]  And God is doing a wonderful work
[1593.28 --> 1601.24]  Jesus had a heart for those who are broken
[1601.24 --> 1603.76]  who have been traumatized
[1603.76 --> 1606.56]  and including the little ones
[1606.56 --> 1609.26]  And they are all very precious to him
[1609.26 --> 1613.16]  And that's why we do this work in his name
[1613.16 --> 1616.22]  Thank you
[1616.22 --> 1622.20]  So this morning we will be opening God's Word
[1622.20 --> 1627.90]  in Ephesians chapter 1
[1628.58 --> 1630.02]  Ephesians chapter 1
[1630.02 --> 1630.04]  Ephesians chapter 1
[1630.04 --> 1633.70]  The verses 13 and 14 we'll be focusing on
[1633.70 --> 1635.98]  But we'll read
[1635.98 --> 1642.00]  The first 14 verses of Ephesians chapter 1
[1642.00 --> 1647.16]  Hear the word of the Lord
[1647.16 --> 1650.08]  Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus
[1650.08 --> 1651.08]  By the will of God
[1651.08 --> 1652.94]  To God's holy people in Ephesus
[1652.94 --> 1653.86]  And Ladner
[1653.86 --> 1656.44]  The faithful in Christ Jesus
[1656.44 --> 1659.10]  Grace and peace to you from God our Father
[1659.10 --> 1660.82]  And the Lord Jesus Christ
[1660.82 --> 1665.50]  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1665.50 --> 1667.30]  Who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
[1667.30 --> 1670.16]  With every spiritual blessing in Christ
[1670.16 --> 1674.64]  For he chose us in him before the creation of the world
[1674.64 --> 1678.00]  To be holy and blameless in his sight
[1678.00 --> 1683.98]  In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship
[1683.98 --> 1685.86]  Through Jesus Christ
[1685.86 --> 1689.84]  In accordance with his pleasure and will
[1689.84 --> 1692.08]  To the praise of his glorious grace
[1692.08 --> 1695.88]  Which he has freely given us in the one he loves
[1695.88 --> 1699.00]  In him we have redemption through his blood
[1699.00 --> 1700.40]  The forgiveness of sins
[1700.40 --> 1702.94]  In accordance with the riches of God's grace
[1702.94 --> 1704.38]  That he lavished on us
[1704.38 --> 1706.96]  With all wisdom and understanding
[1706.96 --> 1709.06]  He made known to us the mystery of his will
[1709.06 --> 1710.54]  According to his good pleasure
[1710.54 --> 1712.42]  Which he purposed in Christ
[1712.42 --> 1715.10]  To be put into effect when the times
[1715.10 --> 1716.40]  Reach their fulfillment
[1716.40 --> 1719.54]  To bring unity to all things in heaven
[1719.54 --> 1721.30]  And on earth and under the earth
[1721.30 --> 1724.34]  In him we were also chosen
[1724.34 --> 1726.28]  Having been predestined
[1726.28 --> 1727.76]  According to the plan of him
[1727.76 --> 1729.00]  Who works out everything
[1729.00 --> 1732.06]  In conformity with the purpose of his will
[1732.06 --> 1734.26]  In order that we
[1734.26 --> 1736.30]  Who were the first to put our hope in Christ
[1736.30 --> 1739.26]  Might be for the praise of his glory
[1739.26 --> 1743.70]  And you also were included in Christ
[1743.70 --> 1745.42]  When you heard the message of the truth
[1745.42 --> 1747.10]  The gospel of your salvation
[1747.10 --> 1749.00]  When you believed
[1749.00 --> 1751.00]  You were marked
[1751.00 --> 1753.74]  In him with a seal
[1753.74 --> 1757.16]  The promised Holy Spirit
[1757.16 --> 1759.12]  Who is a deposit
[1759.12 --> 1761.04]  Guaranteeing our inheritance
[1761.04 --> 1762.36]  Until the redemption
[1762.36 --> 1764.66]  Of those who are God's possession
[1764.66 --> 1768.54]  To the praise of his glory
[1768.54 --> 1771.36]  This is the word of the Lord
[1771.36 --> 1772.98]  Thanks be to God
[1772.98 --> 1792.12]  One of the neatest things to do
[1792.12 --> 1792.66]  I think
[1792.66 --> 1793.48]  In the summer
[1793.48 --> 1794.20]  Is to
[1794.20 --> 1797.28]  Look at waterfalls
[1797.28 --> 1799.64]  To go and visit waterfalls
[1799.64 --> 1801.14]  And you can do that
[1801.14 --> 1801.82]  Here
[1801.82 --> 1804.34]  On the coast
[1804.34 --> 1805.08]  There are many
[1805.08 --> 1806.94]  Beautiful waterfalls to visit
[1806.94 --> 1809.56]  And that's actually what we're going to do
[1809.56 --> 1810.16]  This morning
[1810.16 --> 1812.38]  We're going to visit a waterfall
[1812.38 --> 1815.24]  It's a doxology
[1815.24 --> 1816.06]  That Paul
[1816.06 --> 1816.88]  Paul
[1816.88 --> 1820.48]  Gives to us
[1820.48 --> 1821.18]  At the beginning
[1821.18 --> 1824.10]  Of his letter to the Ephesians
[1824.10 --> 1828.82]  The doxology is really a declaration of praise
[1828.82 --> 1831.82]  It's a declaration of worship to God
[1831.82 --> 1835.14]  And doxology is
[1835.14 --> 1839.02]  Isn't merely what we do on Sunday mornings
[1840.60 --> 1844.72]  It's really what God calls us to every day of our lives
[1844.72 --> 1847.26]  He wants our whole life to be doxology
[1847.26 --> 1850.44]  He wants our whole life to be worship
[1850.44 --> 1855.26]  He wants our whole being to be to the praise of his glory
[1855.26 --> 1864.44]  It's like Paul says in Romans chapter 1
[1864.44 --> 1867.00]  Which I'm sure you are
[1867.00 --> 1869.12]  Rather Romans chapter 12
[1869.12 --> 1871.34]  Which I'm sure you are familiar with
[1871.34 --> 1872.74]  Where he says
[1872.74 --> 1874.42]  Therefore I urge you
[1874.42 --> 1875.60]  Brothers and sisters
[1875.60 --> 1876.76]  In view of God's mercy
[1876.76 --> 1878.30]  To offer your bodies
[1878.30 --> 1880.42]  As a living sacrifice
[1880.42 --> 1881.92]  Holy and pleasing to God
[1881.92 --> 1884.36]  This is your spiritual act of worship
[1884.36 --> 1888.04]  In other words
[1888.04 --> 1890.58]  Offer your whole selves to God
[1890.58 --> 1891.34]  In worship
[1891.34 --> 1896.64]  And so what Paul says here
[1896.64 --> 1897.58]  In Ephesians 1
[1897.58 --> 1903.86]  Is really a summary of what God wants our lives to be
[1903.86 --> 1907.70]  Because Paul begins this letter with a long doxology
[1907.70 --> 1910.30]  With a waterfall doxology
[1910.30 --> 1913.10]  His praise for God
[1913.10 --> 1915.04]  His worship of God
[1915.04 --> 1917.64]  Comes pouring forth like a waterfall
[1917.64 --> 1920.00]  Playfully crashing down
[1920.00 --> 1921.88]  In delightful cascades
[1921.88 --> 1923.98]  Sparkling spray
[1923.98 --> 1927.48]  And thunderous applause
[1927.48 --> 1934.32]  That's exactly what God wants our lives to be
[1934.32 --> 1937.78]  Waterfall
[1937.78 --> 1940.76]  Delightful cascade
[1940.76 --> 1942.48]  Sparkling spray
[1942.48 --> 1943.90]  And thunderous applause
[1943.90 --> 1949.28]  So let's wait at the foot of this waterfall this morning
[1949.28 --> 1953.90]  Here Paul tells us that
[1953.90 --> 1957.70]  And we're going to focus on the verses 13 and 14
[1957.70 --> 1958.70]  Because there's so much here
[1958.70 --> 1962.48]  But we'll just focus on the verses 13 and 14
[1962.48 --> 1966.06]  Where Paul tells us that we are sealed
[1966.06 --> 1969.80]  With the promised Holy Spirit
[1969.80 --> 1975.20]  Aren't those marvelous, marvelous words
[1975.20 --> 1977.40]  And you also were included in Christ
[1977.40 --> 1977.42]  And you also were included in Christ
[1977.42 --> 1978.00]  Paul says
[1978.00 --> 1979.26]  When you heard the word of truth
[1979.26 --> 1980.78]  The gospel of your salvation
[1980.78 --> 1982.84]  Having believed
[1982.84 --> 1985.14]  You were marked in him
[1985.14 --> 1986.72]  With a seal
[1986.72 --> 1991.18]  The promised Holy Spirit
[1991.18 --> 1996.20]  Just think about that
[1996.20 --> 2000.54]  Gaze at this waterfall
[2000.54 --> 2004.32]  You're sealed
[2004.32 --> 2005.52]  With
[2005.52 --> 2007.66]  The promised Holy Spirit
[2007.66 --> 2010.42]  You've been claimed
[2010.42 --> 2011.82]  By Christ
[2011.82 --> 2012.32]  Jesus
[2012.32 --> 2013.90]  The Lamb of God
[2013.90 --> 2015.72]  To whom we sang
[2015.72 --> 2018.62]  This morning
[2018.62 --> 2020.82]  We've been claimed
[2020.82 --> 2022.50]  By Christ
[2022.50 --> 2025.30]  And this claim
[2025.30 --> 2026.36]  Of Christ
[2026.36 --> 2027.28]  Upon us
[2027.28 --> 2028.08]  Is sealed
[2028.08 --> 2029.80]  By the Holy Spirit
[2029.80 --> 2031.68]  It is
[2031.68 --> 2032.72]  Secured
[2032.72 --> 2034.84]  By the Holy Spirit
[2034.84 --> 2037.12]  We belong
[2037.12 --> 2037.88]  To God
[2037.88 --> 2039.96]  And he's made sure
[2039.96 --> 2040.84]  That we
[2040.84 --> 2041.54]  And others
[2041.54 --> 2042.76]  Know this
[2042.76 --> 2047.88]  He wants us
[2047.88 --> 2048.74]  To know this
[2048.74 --> 2049.24]  He wants us
[2049.24 --> 2049.92]  To be certain
[2049.92 --> 2050.98]  Of this
[2050.98 --> 2052.46]  And he does that
[2052.46 --> 2054.06]  By placing his mark
[2054.06 --> 2055.58]  By placing his seal
[2055.58 --> 2057.04]  By placing
[2057.04 --> 2057.78]  To use the words
[2057.78 --> 2059.10]  Of the Belgic Confession
[2059.10 --> 2060.78]  That you're likely familiar with
[2060.78 --> 2062.32]  By placing his emblem
[2062.32 --> 2063.88]  On us
[2063.88 --> 2069.84]  Christ
[2069.84 --> 2071.80]  By his Spirit
[2071.80 --> 2073.12]  Places his emblem
[2073.12 --> 2074.16]  On us
[2074.16 --> 2076.70]  So that we know
[2076.70 --> 2078.78]  So that others know
[2078.78 --> 2081.36]  This person
[2081.36 --> 2083.18]  Belongs
[2083.18 --> 2085.06]  To Christ
[2085.06 --> 2086.64]  Belongs to God
[2086.64 --> 2090.22]  Let's hone in
[2090.22 --> 2090.92]  On that word
[2090.92 --> 2092.18]  Seal
[2092.18 --> 2096.46]  Sealed
[2096.46 --> 2097.76]  By the Holy Spirit
[2097.76 --> 2099.90]  In those days
[2099.90 --> 2100.34]  In the days
[2100.34 --> 2101.08]  That Paul wrote
[2101.08 --> 2101.64]  This letter
[2101.64 --> 2102.86]  Legal documents
[2102.86 --> 2103.36]  Were often
[2103.36 --> 2104.86]  Authenticated
[2104.86 --> 2106.38]  By a wax seal
[2106.38 --> 2109.38]  Like a signature
[2109.38 --> 2110.02]  Now
[2110.02 --> 2110.72]  Nowadays
[2110.72 --> 2111.20]  And now
[2111.20 --> 2112.72]  Electronic signatures
[2112.72 --> 2113.94]  Are sort of
[2113.94 --> 2114.38]  Becoming
[2114.38 --> 2115.20]  The way
[2115.20 --> 2116.24]  Of things
[2116.24 --> 2119.70]  That seal
[2119.70 --> 2121.44]  That God
[2121.44 --> 2121.98]  Gives here
[2121.98 --> 2122.78]  Is unlike
[2122.78 --> 2123.54]  Any other
[2123.54 --> 2124.54]  In Paul's day
[2124.54 --> 2125.88]  Or in our own
[2125.88 --> 2128.60]  You know how it is
[2128.60 --> 2129.56]  When you buy something
[2129.56 --> 2130.20]  And you're given
[2130.20 --> 2131.48]  A guarantee
[2131.48 --> 2134.44]  In fact
[2134.44 --> 2135.14]  To convince you
[2135.14 --> 2135.92]  To buy a certain
[2135.92 --> 2136.38]  Product
[2136.38 --> 2137.26]  The salesperson
[2137.26 --> 2137.58]  Will say
[2137.58 --> 2138.44]  We guarantee
[2138.44 --> 2139.50]  This product
[2139.50 --> 2142.10]  And then
[2142.10 --> 2143.10]  You get
[2143.10 --> 2144.50]  The terms
[2144.50 --> 2145.34]  Of the guarantee
[2145.34 --> 2147.60]  In small print
[2147.60 --> 2149.62]  Ten pages long
[2149.62 --> 2149.94]  Whoever
[2149.94 --> 2151.02]  Is going to read
[2151.02 --> 2151.70]  All that
[2151.70 --> 2153.68]  And then you
[2153.68 --> 2154.74]  Wonder if you
[2154.74 --> 2155.58]  Ever take the time
[2155.58 --> 2156.06]  To read
[2156.06 --> 2157.00]  Through the guarantee
[2157.00 --> 2159.72]  What it's actually worth
[2159.72 --> 2160.54]  How trustworthy
[2160.54 --> 2161.30]  Is it
[2161.30 --> 2162.16]  No
[2162.16 --> 2162.86]  No one
[2162.86 --> 2163.58]  Can actually
[2163.58 --> 2164.88]  100%
[2164.88 --> 2165.54]  Guarantee
[2165.54 --> 2167.30]  Their products
[2167.30 --> 2170.76]  Now compare this
[2170.76 --> 2172.12]  With God's promise
[2172.12 --> 2173.16]  That you are
[2173.16 --> 2174.48]  His possession
[2174.48 --> 2176.98]  The only way
[2176.98 --> 2178.70]  Its terms
[2178.70 --> 2179.74]  Will fail
[2179.74 --> 2183.24]  Is if you
[2183.24 --> 2184.14]  Reject God
[2184.14 --> 2184.96]  And his promises
[2184.96 --> 2190.08]  For his part
[2190.08 --> 2191.02]  God has sealed
[2191.02 --> 2191.52]  It to you
[2191.52 --> 2192.40]  He has secured
[2192.40 --> 2193.00]  It for you
[2193.00 --> 2193.48]  He said
[2193.48 --> 2194.36]  He has said
[2194.36 --> 2195.62]  It's 100%
[2195.62 --> 2196.54]  Guaranteed
[2196.54 --> 2201.40]  And recognize
[2201.40 --> 2201.94]  That this is
[2201.94 --> 2203.04]  No ordinary
[2203.04 --> 2203.56]  Seal
[2203.56 --> 2204.24]  It's not
[2204.24 --> 2205.20]  It's not a human
[2205.20 --> 2205.56]  Seal
[2205.56 --> 2206.38]  It is divine
[2206.38 --> 2207.90]  It's not like
[2207.90 --> 2208.34]  Those
[2208.34 --> 2209.82]  Those guarantees
[2209.82 --> 2210.70]  That you're given
[2210.70 --> 2211.10]  With
[2211.10 --> 2211.98]  10
[2211.98 --> 2213.48]  20 pages
[2213.48 --> 2214.56]  Of small print
[2214.56 --> 2217.74]  In fact
[2217.74 --> 2218.36]  The seal
[2218.36 --> 2219.96]  Of God's
[2219.96 --> 2220.50]  Ownership
[2220.50 --> 2221.02]  Of us
[2221.02 --> 2221.60]  Is
[2221.60 --> 2222.72]  In fact
[2222.72 --> 2223.46]  What Paul says
[2223.46 --> 2224.60]  The Holy Spirit
[2224.60 --> 2225.36]  Himself
[2225.36 --> 2231.56]  Isn't that remarkable
[2231.56 --> 2234.24]  The seal
[2234.24 --> 2234.88]  That Christ
[2234.88 --> 2235.42]  Gives us
[2235.42 --> 2236.20]  The seal
[2236.20 --> 2236.84]  That God
[2236.84 --> 2237.28]  Gives us
[2237.28 --> 2238.02]  That we belong
[2238.02 --> 2238.48]  To him
[2238.48 --> 2239.46]  Is not merely
[2239.46 --> 2241.66]  From the Holy Spirit
[2241.66 --> 2245.96]  The seal
[2245.96 --> 2246.56]  Actually
[2246.56 --> 2247.26]  Is
[2247.26 --> 2249.46]  The Holy Spirit
[2249.46 --> 2252.92]  The Holy Spirit
[2252.92 --> 2253.58]  Is both
[2253.58 --> 2254.38]  The giver
[2254.38 --> 2256.38]  And the gift
[2256.38 --> 2258.92]  He is both
[2258.92 --> 2260.06]  The instrument
[2260.06 --> 2260.78]  Of sealing
[2260.78 --> 2262.18]  And the seal
[2262.18 --> 2262.86]  Itself
[2262.86 --> 2266.90]  Then holy
[2266.90 --> 2267.54]  Baptism
[2267.54 --> 2269.14]  Is the seal
[2269.14 --> 2270.04]  Of that seal
[2270.04 --> 2273.54]  Remember how Paul
[2273.54 --> 2274.60]  Says in 1 Corinthians
[2274.60 --> 2275.72]  6 verse 11
[2275.72 --> 2277.50]  You were washed
[2277.50 --> 2278.96]  You were sanctified
[2278.96 --> 2279.94]  You were justified
[2279.94 --> 2280.70]  In the name
[2280.70 --> 2281.54]  Of the Lord Jesus
[2281.54 --> 2283.70]  And by the spirit
[2283.70 --> 2284.52]  Of our God
[2284.52 --> 2287.46]  And he also says
[2287.46 --> 2288.62]  In 1 Corinthians
[2288.62 --> 2290.14]  13 verse 14
[2290.14 --> 2291.68]  For in one spirit
[2291.68 --> 2293.46]  We are all baptized
[2293.46 --> 2295.30]  Into one body
[2295.30 --> 2298.02]  So holy baptism
[2298.02 --> 2299.26]  Is the seal
[2299.26 --> 2300.20]  Of that
[2300.20 --> 2301.72]  100%
[2301.72 --> 2302.70]  Guaranteed
[2302.70 --> 2303.38]  Seal
[2303.38 --> 2310.32]  This is
[2310.32 --> 2311.66]  Truly astounding
[2311.66 --> 2312.30]  Isn't it
[2312.30 --> 2316.28]  Let's look at this
[2316.28 --> 2316.96]  Waterfall
[2316.96 --> 2322.30]  God gives you
[2322.30 --> 2322.92]  And me
[2322.92 --> 2323.90]  Nothing less
[2323.90 --> 2325.04]  Than himself
[2325.04 --> 2328.32]  The Holy Spirit
[2328.32 --> 2331.12]  As a seal
[2331.12 --> 2332.58]  Of your
[2332.58 --> 2334.00]  And my
[2334.00 --> 2336.06]  Salvation
[2336.06 --> 2340.56]  The Holy Spirit
[2340.56 --> 2341.94]  Has not only placed
[2341.94 --> 2342.82]  His mark
[2342.82 --> 2343.48]  And emblem
[2343.48 --> 2344.44]  On you
[2344.44 --> 2345.20]  And me
[2345.20 --> 2346.46]  In baptism
[2346.46 --> 2349.48]  He is that
[2349.48 --> 2350.08]  Mark
[2350.08 --> 2351.16]  And emblem
[2351.16 --> 2355.32]  And if you
[2355.32 --> 2355.68]  Haven't
[2355.68 --> 2356.72]  Received
[2356.72 --> 2357.74]  That mark
[2357.74 --> 2358.22]  And emblem
[2358.22 --> 2361.74]  Then I would
[2361.74 --> 2363.10]  Invite you to
[2363.10 --> 2364.88]  Do so
[2364.88 --> 2368.76]  God is eager
[2368.76 --> 2369.96]  To place
[2369.96 --> 2370.42]  That
[2370.42 --> 2371.32]  Emblem
[2371.32 --> 2371.82]  On you
[2371.82 --> 2372.34]  As well
[2372.34 --> 2377.56]  The Holy Spirit
[2377.56 --> 2377.80]  Is
[2377.80 --> 2379.00]  Has
[2379.00 --> 2380.06]  I'll say
[2380.06 --> 2380.42]  That again
[2380.42 --> 2381.12]  The Holy Spirit
[2381.12 --> 2382.34]  Has not only
[2382.34 --> 2383.12]  Placed his
[2383.12 --> 2383.40]  Mark
[2383.40 --> 2383.82]  And emblem
[2383.82 --> 2384.40]  On you
[2384.40 --> 2385.08]  He is
[2385.08 --> 2385.80]  That mark
[2385.80 --> 2386.32]  And emblem
[2386.32 --> 2387.72]  You see
[2387.72 --> 2388.52]  The Holy Spirit
[2388.52 --> 2389.86]  Is more
[2389.86 --> 2390.72]  Than an
[2390.72 --> 2391.60]  Inward light
[2391.60 --> 2393.00]  A moral guide
[2393.00 --> 2393.80]  Maybe that's
[2393.80 --> 2394.06]  How we
[2394.06 --> 2394.86]  Sometimes view
[2394.86 --> 2395.16]  Him
[2395.16 --> 2396.76]  And sometimes
[2396.76 --> 2397.48]  That's how
[2397.48 --> 2398.36]  The Holy Spirit
[2398.36 --> 2399.62]  Is portrayed
[2399.62 --> 2403.42]  For you
[2403.42 --> 2403.92]  And me
[2403.92 --> 2404.48]  Who are
[2404.48 --> 2405.70]  In Christ
[2405.70 --> 2409.18]  The Holy Spirit
[2409.18 --> 2410.48]  Is God's
[2410.48 --> 2411.00]  Very
[2411.00 --> 2412.04]  Presence
[2412.04 --> 2412.96]  In you
[2412.96 --> 2415.70]  With you
[2415.70 --> 2417.86]  In your

[2421.86 --> 2422.44]  Leading

[2422.92 --> 2424.98]  To use
[2424.98 --> 2425.46]  The words
[2425.46 --> 2426.12]  Of the
[2426.12 --> 2426.46]  Heidelberg
[2426.46 --> 2427.18]  Catechism

[2428.40 --> 2429.42]  True faith
[2429.42 --> 2430.78]  Uniting you
[2430.78 --> 2432.02]  To Christ

[2436.20 --> 2437.36]  Remaining
[2437.36 --> 2438.80]  With you
[2438.80 --> 2445.16]  One theologian
[2445.16 --> 2445.62]  Has put it
[2445.62 --> 2446.10]  This way
[2446.10 --> 2448.70]  The Spirit
[2448.70 --> 2449.68]  Is to the
[2449.68 --> 2450.16]  Christian
[2450.16 --> 2450.94]  And the
[2450.94 --> 2451.48]  Church
[2451.48 --> 2452.96]  What the

[2462.76 --> 2464.46]  Holy

[2466.54 --> 2467.08]  Lightly

[2476.26 --> 2482.80]  In fact
