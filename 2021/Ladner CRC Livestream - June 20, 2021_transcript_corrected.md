[496.22 → 502.22] We're going to be here with us.
[502.22 → 504.22] In the forum, the sea of the sea and the sea,
[504.22 → 508.22] we're going to be here with us.
[508.22 → 512.22] We're going to be here with us.
[512.22 → 517.14] Our call to worship this morning is from Revelation chapter 15.
[518.16 → 524.52] We'll have it on the screen, and where it is bolded or where it says all, I invite you to say it out loud with me.
[525.14 → 530.18] Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty.
[530.98 → 535.66] Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.
[535.66 → 542.02] Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name?
[542.68 → 544.68] For you alone are holy.
[545.58 → 549.56] All nations will come and worship before you.
[550.02 → 554.38] Let's bow our hearts, bow our heads together in worship this morning in prayer.
[556.96 → 564.80] Our Heavenly Father, Jesus, His Son, the Holy Spirit, Triune God,
[564.80 → 566.94] we give you praise, we give you glory.
[567.18 → 568.28] You are God Almighty.
[569.16 → 576.84] You are holy, holy, holy, three times holy and righteous and just in all of your ways.
[577.92 → 584.22] Father, we come before you seeking to worship you for who you are
[584.22 → 586.80] and who you have revealed yourself to be to us.
[586.80 → 595.00] And Lord, we know that in worshipping you, we are being true to who you have created us to be.
[596.22 → 601.96] So Father, we thank you for calling us into your presence this morning.
[602.18 → 607.62] We thank you for the privilege of being able to gather with one another in a limited extent.
[608.72 → 612.18] And Father, we pray that you would receive and accept our worship
[612.18 → 616.14] and that you would be here present with us by your Holy Spirit.
[616.62 → 618.70] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[619.98 → 623.42] And so God greets us with these words from Revelation chapter 1.
[624.12 → 628.12] To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood
[628.12 → 633.78] and has made us to be a kingdom and priest to serve his God and Father.
[634.40 → 637.58] To him be glory and power forever and ever.
[638.50 → 638.96] Amen.
[638.96 → 644.30] And so the Lord having greeted us and called us to worship him,
[644.84 → 646.40] he's called us as a community.
[647.22 → 649.92] He's called us as one body united together.
[650.06 → 655.26] And so let's turn and greet one another, those who are sitting around us, for you at home.
[655.96 → 659.18] Greet those sitting with you and also maybe take the opportunity later today
[659.18 → 661.22] to reach out to call or text someone.
[661.22 → 661.30] Amen.
[668.96 → 670.02] Amen.
[674.34 → 674.64] Amen.
[674.64 → 700.62] Thank you.
[700.62 → 704.02] Let all the earth rejoice
[704.02 → 706.82] All the earth rejoice
[706.82 → 713.60] He rattles himself in light
[713.60 → 716.92] And darkness tries to hide
[716.92 → 719.28] And trembles at his cross
[719.28 → 723.24] And trembles at his voice
[723.24 → 728.06] Await is our God
[728.06 → 731.08] Sing with me our praise
[731.08 → 732.24] Our God
[732.24 → 735.42] And all the sea our praise
[735.42 → 740.36] Our praise is our God
[740.36 → 750.44] Await is our God
[750.44 → 754.00] Await is our God
[754.00 → 756.14] Be willing at the end
[756.14 → 759.46] Be willing at the end
[759.46 → 765.36] The God has been one
[765.36 → 769.26] Father, Spirit, Son
[769.26 → 771.46] The light and the hell
[771.46 → 775.00] The light and the hell
[775.00 → 780.34] Await is our God
[780.34 → 783.36] Sing with me our praise
[783.36 → 784.36] Our God
[784.36 → 787.70] Call the sea our praise
[787.70 → 792.34] Our praise is our God
[792.34 → 798.34] In the heart of all age
[798.34 → 802.34] Worthy of all praise
[802.34 → 804.36] My heart will sing
[804.36 → 808.16] Our praise is our God
[808.16 → 808.36] My heart will sing
[808.36 → 810.48] Our praise is our God
[810.48 → 812.30] Be willing at the end
[812.30 → 813.26] Be willing at the end
[813.26 → 815.48] In the heart of all age
[815.48 → 819.36] Worthy of all praise
[819.36 → 821.28] My heart will sing
[821.28 → 825.36] Our praise is our God
[825.36 → 827.36] Our praise is our God
[827.36 → 828.38] Sing with me our praise
[828.38 → 829.38] Our praise is our God
[829.38 → 830.38] Sing with me our praise
[830.38 → 838.40] Our praise is our God
[838.40 → 839.40] Our praise is our God
[839.40 → 840.40] Sing with me our praise
[840.40 → 843.40] Our praise is our God
[843.40 → 873.38] Our praise is our God
[873.40 → 903.38] Our praise is our God
[903.40 → 933.38] Our praise is our God
[933.38 → 935.38] O tender voice
[935.38 → 937.38] O tender voice my heart
[937.38 → 943.38] And peace of God
[943.38 → 950.38] I need Thee, O I need Thee
[950.38 → 954.38] Every hour I need Thee
[954.38 → 956.38] O bless me now
[956.38 → 958.38] O bless me now
[958.38 → 959.38] My Saviour
[959.38 → 964.38] I come to Thee
[964.38 → 972.38] I need Thee every hour
[972.38 → 974.38] Stay Thou
[974.38 → 978.38] Stay Thou near my
[978.38 → 980.38] Temptations
[980.38 → 982.38] O bless me now
[982.38 → 984.38] I come to Thee
[984.38 → 988.38] I come to Thee
[988.38 → 990.38] I need Thee
[990.38 → 992.38] I need Thee
[992.38 → 995.80] Oh, I need Thee.
[996.64 → 1000.70] Every hour I need Thee.
[1001.04 → 1005.54] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour.
[1006.38 → 1012.20] I come to Thee.
[1022.38 → 1041.38] I need Thee every hour,
[1041.38 → 1046.68] O holy God.
[1047.28 → 1051.58] Oh, make me Thine in me,
[1051.58 → 1056.58] O blessed Son.
[1057.68 → 1063.48] I need Thee, oh, I need Thee.
[1063.88 → 1067.58] Every hour I need Thee.
[1067.58 → 1072.92] Oh, bless me now, my Saviour.
[1073.74 → 1079.58] I come to Thee.
[1081.58 → 1083.58] I come to Thee.
[1083.58 → 1087.58] I come to Thee.
[1087.58 → 1091.58] I come to Thee.
[1091.58 → 1099.58] Like the people who greeted Jesus as He entered Jerusalem, but then later shouted, crucify Him.
[1099.58 → 1105.58] There are people who often deny Christ in our own thoughts and words and deeds.
[1105.58 → 1114.70] But though we are sinners in need of a Saviour, we have a Saviour indeed in Jesus Christ.
[1114.70 → 1125.30] And so, as part of our worship, we come before our Lord in honesty of our own sin and in our need of a Saviour,
[1125.30 → 1130.20] and also in hope that indeed we do have a Saviour who does forgive us.
[1130.20 → 1133.20] So let's confess now our sins to God.
[1133.20 → 1139.20] We'll have a responsive prayer together on the screen where it says,
[1139.20 → 1141.20] all please join me.
[1141.20 → 1150.20] O righteous God, you have crowned Jesus Christ as Lord of all.
[1150.20 → 1158.20] We confess that we have not bowed before Him and are slow to acknowledge His rule.
[1158.20 → 1170.20] We give allegiance to the powers of this world and fail to be governed by justice and love.
[1170.20 → 1174.20] In Your mercy, forgive us.
[1174.20 → 1187.20] Raise us to acclaim Him as ruler of all, that we may be loyal ambassadors, obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1187.20 → 1190.20] Amen.
[1190.20 → 1197.20] Now hear these words of grace from Revelation chapter 5.
[1197.20 → 1198.20] It says,
[1198.20 → 1199.20] Do not weep.
[1199.20 → 1206.20] See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has triumphed.
[1206.20 → 1214.20] With His blood He has purchased people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[1214.20 → 1222.20] He has made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.
[1222.20 → 1224.20] Thanks be to God.
[1224.20 → 1226.20] Let's sing a song of response together.
[1226.20 → 1255.20] To the river I am calling,
[1255.20 → 1256.20] Johannes of Christ andство!!!!
[1256.20 → 1265.20] From the river I am calling,
[1265.20 → 1272.20] And while Terraria Jupiter Noah is held approval,
[1272.20 → 1275.26] My home Receive of the bridge of sorrow O Israel,
[1275.26 → 1278.20] games of concrete mercy.
[1278.20 → 1283.20] Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1283.20 → 1287.20] Lord, I need you there
[1287.20 → 1294.20] In these waters, feeling mercy
[1294.20 → 1297.20] Close with freedom from despair
[1297.20 → 1302.20] I am going to that river
[1302.20 → 1307.20] Lord, I need you there
[1307.20 → 1313.20] Precious Jesus, I am ready
[1313.20 → 1317.20] To surrender every care
[1317.20 → 1322.20] Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1322.20 → 1326.20] Lord, I need you there
[1326.20 → 1333.20] Come and join us in the river
[1333.20 → 1337.20] Come find life beyond compare
[1337.20 → 1343.20] He is calling, He is waiting
[1343.20 → 1347.20] Jesus longs to meet you there
[1347.20 → 1353.20] Precious Jesus, I am ready
[1353.20 → 1357.20] To surrender every care
[1357.20 → 1361.20] Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1361.20 → 1365.20] Lord, I need you there
[1365.20 → 1371.20] Take my hand now, lead me closer
[1371.20 → 1373.20] Lord, I need you there
[1373.20 → 1377.20] Lord, I need you there
[1377.20 → 1381.20] Lord, I need you there
[1381.20 → 1397.20] Lord, I need you there
[1397.20 → 1399.20] Lord, I need you there
[1399.20 → 1400.20] Lord, I am certainly looking forward
[1400.20 → 1401.20] To when we can all stand
[1401.20 → 1403.20] And sing together
[1409.20 → 1410.20] Um, one second
[1410.20 → 1415.20] Technical difficulties
[1415.20 → 1433.80] Just one more minute.
[1435.24 → 1436.42] I know what I did wrong.
[1445.20 → 1460.16] Okay, we're live.
[1460.16 → 1460.66] Okay.
[1461.94 → 1467.16] So we are in a sermon series this summer on the Songs of Ascent.
[1467.58 → 1470.28] The Songs of Ascent, you can find them in the Psalms.
[1470.58 → 1473.22] It's Psalms 120 through 134.
[1473.22 → 1476.96] So it's a small collection within the whole Psalter, which is 150 Psalms.
[1477.58 → 1483.56] And today, in this series, we are on the third Psalm, Psalm 122.
[1483.76 → 1488.20] So we started with 120, last week 121, today Psalm 122.
[1488.80 → 1494.28] So let's read God's Word together, and then we will pray.
[1495.02 → 1496.38] So Psalm 122.
[1496.38 → 1500.78] A song of ascents of David.
[1500.78 → 1504.30] I rejoiced with those who said to me,
[1504.52 → 1506.78] Let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1507.32 → 1510.68] Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.
[1511.76 → 1515.98] Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.
[1516.68 → 1521.20] That is where the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord,
[1521.72 → 1527.34] to praise the name of the Lord according to the statute given to Israel.
[1527.34 → 1533.54] There stand the thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
[1534.34 → 1535.76] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[1536.80 → 1538.50] May those who love you be secure.
[1539.22 → 1542.72] May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.
[1543.36 → 1546.40] And for the sake of my family and friends, I will say,
[1547.20 → 1548.58] Peace be within.
[1549.28 → 1552.26] For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,
[1552.26 → 1555.64] I will seek your prosperity.
[1556.88 → 1558.48] And this is the Word of the Lord.
[1559.22 → 1560.22] Thanks be to God.
[1560.44 → 1561.20] Let's pray together.
[1562.86 → 1567.30] Father, we come now before you and before your Word.
[1568.60 → 1573.92] And Lord, as you have called us and you have received our praises to you,
[1573.92 → 1578.36] still, Lord, having confessed our sin and heard your forgiveness,
[1579.36 → 1580.38] we need your Word.
[1580.98 → 1583.94] We need your Word to shape us, to teach us,
[1584.22 → 1588.90] how to live this pilgrim life that you have called us on to follow Christ.
[1590.10 → 1592.96] And so, Lord, we pray that you would open our eyes and our hearts
[1592.96 → 1595.26] by the power of your Spirit within us,
[1595.88 → 1597.60] Lord, to see Jesus more clearly.
[1597.96 → 1599.02] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1599.32 → 1599.62] Amen.
[1599.62 → 1599.70] Amen.
[1601.82 → 1604.90] So at my house, in the front yard, kind of on the side,
[1605.06 → 1608.80] there is a there was a large grove of bamboo.
[1609.06 → 1610.56] We didn't put it there, but it was there.
[1610.88 → 1613.42] And it was actually just spreading and spreading and taking over.
[1613.76 → 1615.30] And that's where we have our power meter.
[1615.44 → 1617.28] And so the power meter guy couldn't get to it.
[1617.82 → 1619.96] So finally, my wife Christy got tired of it.
[1620.22 → 1620.88] She went out there.
[1620.96 → 1622.80] She grabbed some old rusty clippers.
[1622.86 → 1624.00] And she just went to work.
[1624.00 → 1627.62] And she is just like, it was, she must have drank a lot of coffee.
[1627.62 → 1629.88] But piles of bamboo.
[1630.00 → 1631.54] I mean, she was just tearing it out of the fence.
[1631.60 → 1632.06] It was everywhere.
[1633.32 → 1634.22] Totally cleared.
[1635.72 → 1636.80] A week later.
[1638.20 → 1639.64] Maybe it was like 10 days.
[1640.10 → 1644.12] Look at how much bamboo has grown right back up.
[1644.26 → 1645.00] It just shoots up.
[1646.04 → 1650.48] The thing is, bamboo is incredibly resilient.
[1651.84 → 1653.04] And I was thinking about this.
[1653.04 → 1660.50] And I was thinking, well, you know, in the same way, the truth about the church is that the church is resilient.
[1661.76 → 1664.54] The church can't be killed ever.
[1665.56 → 1665.68] Right?
[1665.76 → 1673.76] Jesus said he will not allow the gates of hell, even, to prevail against the church.
[1675.14 → 1677.20] You know if we think about the New Testament,
[1677.20 → 1682.12] the whole New Testament church, as we read in Acts last summer,
[1682.46 → 1686.60] it grew under the persecution of the Roman Empire.
[1687.68 → 1692.52] And so the church father, Tertullian, even said that it is the blood of the martyrs
[1692.52 → 1696.66] that has become the sea that gives birth to the church.
[1696.66 → 1703.98] So even when the church has come under attack, as it has throughout history,
[1704.68 → 1707.80] it is resilient, and it will continue to grow.
[1708.60 → 1709.04] Why?
[1709.46 → 1712.40] Because Jesus Christ himself is Lord of the church.
[1712.82 → 1715.40] And he has died for the church.
[1715.50 → 1719.06] He has risen in victory and is seated on the throne,
[1719.32 → 1722.36] having put all things under his authority.
[1722.56 → 1724.04] And he is ruling.
[1724.18 → 1725.94] And he is building his church.
[1726.66 → 1732.20] And so the church grows, despite all opposition and all kinds of attempts to kill it.
[1732.88 → 1738.16] And it's an amazing thing, especially because being a Christian,
[1738.74 → 1742.02] going to church, is completely voluntary.
[1743.18 → 1743.32] Right?
[1743.40 → 1743.94] Think about that.
[1744.66 → 1745.50] The church is growing.
[1745.68 → 1747.72] People are coming in because they want to.
[1747.88 → 1749.30] They want to be a part of this.
[1749.38 → 1750.80] They want to know and worship God.
[1752.36 → 1754.30] Eugene Peterson observes this.
[1754.30 → 1755.96] He says,
[1755.96 → 1757.38] going to church is voluntary.
[1758.44 → 1766.18] And yet, there are more people at worship on any given Sunday than there are at all the football games,
[1766.58 → 1771.96] or on all the golf courses, or fishing, or taking a walk in the woods.
[1772.42 → 1776.22] Worship is the single most popular act in the land.
[1776.22 → 1781.36] And this is true even today.
[1782.04 → 1783.18] It has been true forever.
[1784.06 → 1789.44] And it's because we were created to know God and to worship him.
[1790.30 → 1793.16] God has created human beings.
[1793.30 → 1797.64] He's created creatures that he wants to have a relationship with.
[1797.64 → 1800.54] And he created us to know and worship him.
[1801.54 → 1803.00] The one true and living God.
[1803.30 → 1805.76] And so men, women, and children for centuries and centuries,
[1805.96 → 1808.78] all the way back to our Jewish ancestors,
[1809.72 → 1812.84] have been saying the words of Psalm 122.
[1813.26 → 1815.34] I rejoiced with those who said to me,
[1815.58 → 1818.16] let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1818.16 → 1823.02] So in this series of Psalms, the Songs of Ascent,
[1823.12 → 1825.82] you know, we've talked about how these are pilgrim songs.
[1826.32 → 1831.24] And we believe that they were the songs that God's people would have sung
[1831.24 → 1837.56] as they made their journey up to Jerusalem on pilgrimage
[1837.56 → 1839.88] to go up on the great holy days.
[1839.88 → 1845.50] And today, God has given us these Psalms for us.
[1846.40 → 1850.36] And so they teach us also how to be pilgrims.
[1850.82 → 1853.60] They teach us how to be disciples, how to be followers of Christ.
[1854.06 → 1857.84] They teach us also practices of the Christian life
[1857.84 → 1863.20] that we need to know as each one of us join Jesus
[1863.20 → 1868.52] in our own pilgrimages to our heavenly home.
[1868.52 → 1871.82] And so in this Psalm, Psalm 122,
[1871.92 → 1876.02] we learn about the discipline and the practice of worship.
[1877.36 → 1881.36] It's about what does it mean to be part of a worshipping community
[1881.36 → 1882.90] called the church.
[1883.76 → 1886.58] And so what does the writer David here say
[1886.58 → 1890.58] about what it means to be part of this gathered community in worship?
[1891.26 → 1892.88] And I want to look at this Psalm
[1892.88 → 1895.86] and just look at two kind of main ideas that I see in this Psalm.
[1896.16 → 1896.98] So two headings.
[1896.98 → 1898.70] One, where we worship.
[1899.18 → 1900.48] And then secondly, how we worship.
[1901.08 → 1901.76] Those are the two things.
[1901.84 → 1903.06] Where we worship, how we worship.
[1903.62 → 1905.18] So first, where we worship.
[1905.92 → 1907.62] And what we see in Psalm 122,
[1907.74 → 1910.12] it's not just that God's people worship.
[1910.96 → 1912.38] It's about where they worship.
[1912.88 → 1914.86] And where they worship, we see very clearly,
[1915.38 → 1916.72] is in Jerusalem.
[1917.64 → 1918.70] So that's what we're going to think about.
[1918.70 → 1922.26] Now, the pilgrims of ancient Israel,
[1922.76 → 1925.94] they sang these songs on a journey.
[1926.20 → 1929.08] And where they were going was to the city of Jerusalem,
[1929.08 → 1932.10] up to Mount Zion, where the temple was.
[1932.64 → 1934.62] And this song is, you read it,
[1934.68 → 1936.32] it's full of anticipation
[1936.32 → 1939.70] of seeing this holy city of Jerusalem,
[1940.34 → 1941.66] of standing in its gates
[1941.66 → 1945.62] and beholding the beauty and the splendour of the city.
[1945.62 → 1946.90] So it says,
[1947.02 → 1948.62] I rejoiced with those who said to me,
[1948.72 → 1950.28] let us go to the house of the Lord.
[1950.90 → 1953.70] Our feet are standing in your gates,
[1953.88 → 1954.66] O Jerusalem.
[1955.98 → 1958.92] So the psalmist here is filled with awe
[1958.92 → 1962.44] and wonder at this magnificent and great city.
[1962.66 → 1963.88] He goes on in verse three
[1963.88 → 1966.72] about how it is built tightly together.
[1966.72 → 1969.82] And I think that means it is well-ordered,
[1970.00 → 1970.90] it's well-structured,
[1971.16 → 1973.86] it has these walls all around it,
[1973.94 → 1975.86] which means that it is safe,
[1976.02 → 1977.12] it is protected.
[1978.24 → 1982.48] But not only was the city itself just super impressive,
[1983.18 → 1987.56] it was the centre of the entire Jewish world.
[1988.70 → 1992.18] Politically, it's where the throne of David was.
[1992.30 → 1994.06] In verse five, it says,
[1994.06 → 1998.16] it was where David brought order and peace
[1998.16 → 2000.26] to the people of Israel.
[2000.70 → 2003.48] And so the whole kingship of Israel
[2003.48 → 2006.14] is represented by Jerusalem,
[2006.56 → 2009.56] God's good laws and rule
[2009.56 → 2012.28] that would govern all of his people.
[2013.48 → 2015.68] But mostly, and here's the key point,
[2016.52 → 2019.36] this is the place where the people came to worship.
[2020.34 → 2022.72] It is where the great temple was built.
[2022.72 → 2024.70] You see, that's the main thing
[2024.70 → 2026.24] that's so special about Jerusalem,
[2026.38 → 2027.84] that it is the home of the temple.
[2028.66 → 2030.16] And the temple, of course,
[2030.22 → 2032.58] is the dwelling place of God himself.
[2033.34 → 2036.42] It's sometimes even called the throne of God.
[2036.52 → 2037.96] This is where God sits
[2037.96 → 2040.92] and where he receives the praises of his people
[2040.92 → 2042.26] and from where he rules.
[2043.12 → 2044.78] And one of the features of the temple
[2044.78 → 2048.90] in this time of the singing of these psalms
[2048.90 → 2051.36] is we see that there are different degrees of holiness
[2051.36 → 2055.76] and there are different degrees of access
[2055.76 → 2057.40] to God's throne.
[2057.48 → 2060.46] So I want you to imagine with me the entire world.
[2061.40 → 2062.34] Okay, the entire world.
[2062.62 → 2064.76] And out of the entire world,
[2065.28 → 2067.72] Israel was the holy land.
[2068.70 → 2069.64] Okay, do you have that in mind?
[2069.76 → 2070.42] The whole world,
[2070.50 → 2071.78] and there's this place called Israel,
[2071.94 → 2072.64] it's the holy land.
[2072.92 → 2075.64] And out of the whole holy land of Israel,
[2075.64 → 2078.50] you had the holy city, Jerusalem.
[2079.86 → 2081.96] And then within the holy city,
[2082.22 → 2085.06] there was the holy temple.
[2085.72 → 2087.16] And then within the holy temple,
[2087.16 → 2089.50] there were even degrees of holiness.
[2090.02 → 2092.04] There was the holy place within the temple.
[2092.84 → 2094.72] And then even deeper within,
[2095.12 → 2097.64] there was the most holy place.
[2097.90 → 2099.38] And that was so holy
[2099.38 → 2102.22] that you can only go there,
[2102.22 → 2104.12] only the high priest could go there,
[2104.16 → 2105.16] and only once a year.
[2106.40 → 2107.88] So now most of these pilgrims
[2107.88 → 2109.20] who are making their way to Jerusalem
[2109.20 → 2110.30] to worship the Lord,
[2111.44 → 2114.18] none of them would have ever gone near
[2114.18 → 2115.26] the holy of holies.
[2115.30 → 2117.76] Most of them wouldn't have even gone close.
[2118.46 → 2120.94] And yet they know that they are coming closer
[2120.94 → 2122.26] and closer to God's throne,
[2122.78 → 2124.94] right, which is the ark of the covenant
[2124.94 → 2126.60] inside the holy of holies
[2126.60 → 2128.68] with the wings of the cherubim spread out over it.
[2128.68 → 2133.52] So people are approaching God's throne,
[2133.94 → 2136.60] and though they will never see that throne,
[2137.20 → 2139.80] they are filled with joy and gladness
[2139.80 → 2142.52] because they're going up to where God is.
[2142.62 → 2144.86] They are approaching God in worship.
[2145.90 → 2147.80] I rejoiced with those who said to me,
[2147.88 → 2149.14] let us go to the house of the Lord.
[2149.78 → 2150.86] Hey, they're filled with joy.
[2151.56 → 2153.24] Okay, so now that's the setting of this psalm.
[2154.06 → 2156.08] These pilgrims are going up to Jerusalem
[2156.08 → 2157.06] to worship God
[2157.06 → 2158.66] because that's where the temple was,
[2159.08 → 2161.02] where God dwelt with his people.
[2162.22 → 2163.78] Now, how does this apply to us today?
[2165.12 → 2166.88] You know, we're talking about how it's helpful
[2166.88 → 2169.02] to see the entire Christian life as a pilgrimage.
[2169.88 → 2172.52] And those of us who are pilgrims
[2172.52 → 2173.94] in this Christian life,
[2174.48 → 2179.16] we need to realize that we still go to Jerusalem to worship.
[2180.46 → 2181.36] Okay, that's the big idea.
[2181.96 → 2186.02] We today still go to Jerusalem to worship.
[2186.02 → 2188.00] What do I mean by that?
[2188.82 → 2191.34] One of the things that the writers of the New Testament
[2191.34 → 2194.14] talk about is that the earthly temple, right,
[2194.20 → 2195.52] the earthly city of Jerusalem
[2195.52 → 2198.08] was always meant to be a reflection
[2198.08 → 2201.88] or a type of the heavenly Jerusalem,
[2202.00 → 2203.94] the heavenly city and the heavenly temple.
[2204.62 → 2205.44] And the New Testament,
[2205.66 → 2206.90] especially in the book of Hebrews,
[2207.56 → 2210.34] says that all who are followers of Jesus
[2210.34 → 2212.58] now have access,
[2212.90 → 2216.78] not just to some parts of the earthly Jerusalem,
[2217.14 → 2220.36] not even access to the entire temple of Jerusalem,
[2220.36 → 2223.06] which would have been mind-boggling.
[2223.62 → 2227.94] We have access to the true throne of God
[2227.94 → 2230.04] in heaven itself.
[2230.78 → 2233.20] So here's how the author of Hebrews puts it
[2233.20 → 2234.18] in chapter 12.
[2234.18 → 2236.14] He says,
[2236.14 → 2239.40] But you have come to Mount Zion,
[2240.04 → 2242.16] to the city of the living God,
[2242.48 → 2244.22] the heavenly Jerusalem.
[2245.04 → 2247.44] You have come to thousands upon thousands
[2247.44 → 2250.30] of angels in joyful assembly,
[2250.30 → 2252.58] to the church of the firstborn,
[2252.86 → 2254.46] whose names are written in heaven.
[2254.90 → 2256.68] You have come to God,
[2257.08 → 2258.14] the judge of all,
[2258.50 → 2260.52] to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[2260.52 → 2261.76] to Jesus,
[2262.28 → 2264.04] the mediator of a new covenant.
[2265.10 → 2267.80] And he's saying that this happens
[2267.80 → 2270.62] every time that Christians worship.
[2271.60 → 2274.26] And what that means is that we need to
[2274.26 → 2278.34] have our imaginations reshaped, don't we?
[2279.22 → 2281.70] So that when we come to worship
[2281.70 → 2282.88] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2282.88 → 2284.06] and the power of the Holy Spirit,
[2284.30 → 2285.52] that we, in a sense,
[2285.58 → 2286.58] are caught up
[2286.58 → 2289.18] and are spiritually worshipping,
[2289.18 → 2290.74] not just here in this building,
[2291.40 → 2293.80] not in the earthly Jerusalem in Israel,
[2294.04 → 2297.02] but we are worshipping in heaven itself
[2297.02 → 2298.66] in the heavenly Jerusalem.
[2299.86 → 2301.32] Access to God's throne
[2301.32 → 2302.92] that these early pilgrims
[2302.92 → 2306.48] could never have imagined having
[2306.48 → 2308.96] is ours
[2308.96 → 2311.64] for all of us who follow Jesus Christ.
[2312.46 → 2312.60] Right?
[2312.64 → 2313.44] And so that doesn't matter
[2313.44 → 2314.58] if you are worshipping
[2314.58 → 2316.82] in this big, beautiful cathedral in Europe,
[2316.82 → 2319.14] or if you're in kind of suburban,
[2319.42 → 2321.16] modern church building
[2321.16 → 2322.16] like we are in now,
[2322.22 → 2323.70] or if you are in China
[2323.70 → 2325.24] in a small apartment.
[2325.98 → 2327.94] When Christians gather to worship,
[2328.56 → 2329.80] we need to remember that
[2329.80 → 2332.00] we have access
[2332.00 → 2333.68] to the heavenly Jerusalem.
[2334.44 → 2335.88] And we are participating,
[2336.10 → 2337.32] as Hebrews 12 says,
[2337.66 → 2339.94] with thousands of angels,
[2340.10 → 2341.50] with the great assembly
[2341.50 → 2343.84] of all the church triumphant,
[2343.84 → 2344.98] all of those who have died
[2344.98 → 2346.40] in faith
[2346.40 → 2347.42] and are already
[2347.42 → 2348.40] in God's presence.
[2350.36 → 2351.14] It's amazing.
[2351.70 → 2352.60] Now, the question is,
[2352.80 → 2354.04] how is it possible
[2354.04 → 2355.12] that we have access
[2355.12 → 2356.62] to the Holy of Holies,
[2356.94 → 2359.64] not the physical Holy of Holies,
[2359.72 → 2362.80] but the real Holy of Holies,
[2362.90 → 2363.64] God's presence?
[2364.58 → 2365.80] The answer is
[2365.80 → 2367.16] Jesus.
[2368.34 → 2370.78] It's because Jesus himself
[2370.78 → 2372.50] went up to Jerusalem
[2372.50 → 2373.42] on his own pilgrimage.
[2373.80 → 2374.12] Literally.
[2375.00 → 2376.20] He went up to Jerusalem
[2376.20 → 2377.84] to die on the cross,
[2378.00 → 2379.34] to take away
[2379.34 → 2380.68] all that separates us
[2380.68 → 2381.92] from God's presence.
[2382.34 → 2383.40] And when Jesus died,
[2383.44 → 2384.78] we know the curtain
[2384.78 → 2386.14] that separates the Holy of Holies
[2386.14 → 2387.52] was torn from top to bottom.
[2388.98 → 2390.74] And Jesus brings us
[2390.74 → 2392.86] into our heavenly home.
[2392.94 → 2394.98] We have access to God.
[2396.20 → 2397.42] And so when we gather to worship,
[2397.50 → 2398.72] like we're doing right now,
[2398.72 → 2400.34] we can say,
[2401.08 → 2402.20] I rejoice with those
[2402.20 → 2402.92] who said to me,
[2403.00 → 2403.92] let us go to the house
[2403.92 → 2404.52] of the Lord.
[2404.90 → 2407.50] Let us go to the heavenly Jerusalem.
[2410.54 → 2412.40] So now the second main idea
[2412.40 → 2413.48] we see in this passage
[2413.48 → 2414.32] as we continue
[2414.32 → 2415.32] through the text
[2415.32 → 2416.58] and that I want to look at
[2416.58 → 2417.86] is how we worship.
[2418.14 → 2419.26] So not just where we worship,
[2419.38 → 2420.26] but how we worship.
[2421.14 → 2421.92] So if it's true
[2421.92 → 2422.68] that God's people
[2422.68 → 2423.62] worship in Jerusalem,
[2424.40 → 2426.16] well, it means that God's people
[2426.16 → 2427.38] need to pray for Jerusalem.
[2427.38 → 2429.68] And one of the most important things
[2429.68 → 2430.66] that we can do in worship
[2430.66 → 2432.00] is to pray.
[2433.02 → 2435.10] So notice that the ancient pilgrims
[2435.10 → 2436.00] in this song
[2436.00 → 2438.44] are called to worship in Jerusalem
[2438.44 → 2440.84] and they are called to pray
[2440.84 → 2442.94] for the city of Jerusalem.
[2443.42 → 2444.66] So let's look at it again,
[2444.74 → 2445.82] beginning in verse 6.
[2447.00 → 2447.84] David writes,
[2449.54 → 2451.70] it'll be here in a second.
[2452.94 → 2453.70] There it is.
[2454.02 → 2455.56] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[2455.56 → 2458.26] And then he kind of starts praying,
[2458.42 → 2459.08] right, in the quotes.
[2459.18 → 2459.44] It says,
[2459.94 → 2461.38] may those who love you
[2461.38 → 2462.46] be secure.
[2462.80 → 2463.62] May there be peace
[2463.62 → 2464.40] within your walls
[2464.40 → 2466.14] and security within your citadels.
[2466.68 → 2467.28] Then he says,
[2467.36 → 2468.26] for the sake of my family
[2468.26 → 2468.86] and my friends,
[2468.92 → 2469.58] I will say,
[2470.04 → 2471.20] peace be within you.
[2471.68 → 2472.80] For the sake of the house
[2472.80 → 2473.80] of the Lord our God,
[2473.90 → 2475.42] I will seek your prosperity.
[2476.60 → 2477.68] So first notice
[2477.68 → 2479.38] that this is very emphatic.
[2480.04 → 2480.26] Right?
[2480.30 → 2481.34] It's not like a suggestion.
[2481.44 → 2481.76] It's not like,
[2481.82 → 2482.16] oh, well,
[2482.22 → 2483.32] maybe we should pray
[2483.32 → 2483.90] for Jerusalem.
[2484.44 → 2485.64] It actually just says,
[2486.18 → 2487.64] pray for Jerusalem.
[2489.14 → 2490.26] So for those of us
[2490.26 → 2491.18] who are pilgrims today,
[2492.52 → 2494.00] I think the way we apply this
[2494.00 → 2495.62] is that we actually pray
[2495.62 → 2497.00] for the city of Jerusalem.
[2497.82 → 2498.00] Right?
[2498.02 → 2498.88] When we look at the city
[2498.88 → 2499.74] of Jerusalem today,
[2499.98 → 2501.20] it is a beautiful place
[2501.20 → 2502.62] and it is also a broken place
[2502.62 → 2503.32] that needs prayer.
[2504.48 → 2504.68] You know,
[2504.72 → 2505.86] just even in recent weeks,
[2505.94 → 2507.12] there were renewed hostilities
[2507.12 → 2508.90] between the Israeli
[2508.90 → 2510.22] and Palestinian forces.
[2510.66 → 2511.90] And it's a city also
[2511.90 → 2512.62] that is holy,
[2513.14 → 2514.00] not only to Christians,
[2514.16 → 2515.36] but to Jews and Muslims.
[2515.76 → 2516.56] And so consequently,
[2516.56 → 2518.48] there is a lot of tension.
[2519.76 → 2521.58] And so it is always right
[2521.58 → 2523.76] to pray regularly
[2523.76 → 2525.94] for the peace of Jerusalem.
[2526.94 → 2527.74] We need to pray
[2527.74 → 2530.62] for the people of that place.
[2530.78 → 2531.48] We need to pray
[2531.48 → 2533.88] for the end of hostilities,
[2534.48 → 2536.04] for the healing of wounds,
[2536.14 → 2537.22] and for true justice.
[2537.22 → 2538.72] But most importantly,
[2538.88 → 2539.76] we need to pray for the gospel.
[2540.30 → 2540.42] Right?
[2540.46 → 2541.36] We need to pray for the gospel
[2541.36 → 2543.52] to go forth into that place
[2543.52 → 2544.96] so that all those
[2544.96 → 2546.92] who are part of the city of peace,
[2546.94 → 2547.82] that's what Jerusalem means,
[2547.88 → 2549.82] would know the Prince of Peace,
[2550.24 → 2551.32] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2554.60 → 2556.40] You may know the name Hudson Taylor.
[2556.68 → 2559.68] He was a pioneer missionary
[2559.68 → 2561.38] into the interior of China.
[2561.56 → 2562.56] So he felt called
[2562.56 → 2563.50] to bring the gospel
[2563.50 → 2565.08] to the Chinese people
[2565.08 → 2566.50] where they had never heard
[2566.50 → 2566.98] the gospel.
[2566.98 → 2568.18] Not just the poor cities,
[2568.28 → 2569.08] but into the interior.
[2570.78 → 2572.80] But I read this antidote
[2572.80 → 2574.20] a long time ago,
[2574.66 → 2575.66] and it stuck with me,
[2575.92 → 2576.84] that Hudson Taylor
[2576.84 → 2578.50] would still support missions
[2578.50 → 2580.96] to Israel, to Jerusalem.
[2581.20 → 2582.56] And so he had some friends
[2582.56 → 2583.42] who were missionaries
[2583.42 → 2584.94] to Israel.
[2585.14 → 2587.18] And he would support them financially.
[2587.38 → 2588.02] And so he would kind of
[2588.02 → 2588.82] send a check,
[2589.22 → 2591.00] and he would write on the memo
[2591.00 → 2592.62] or in a letter
[2592.62 → 2594.58] to the Jews first.
[2594.58 → 2596.68] You know where that comes from,
[2596.72 → 2597.66] Romans 1.16.
[2598.08 → 2599.12] The gospel is for the Jews first
[2599.12 → 2600.30] and also to the Gentiles.
[2600.40 → 2601.68] So he would send the money
[2601.68 → 2603.14] and he'd write to the Jews first.
[2603.84 → 2605.04] And he'd send it to his friend.
[2605.86 → 2606.90] And then what would his friend do?
[2607.90 → 2609.04] His friend would write a check
[2609.04 → 2610.66] to support his work
[2610.66 → 2612.06] in China
[2612.06 → 2613.12] and write on the memo
[2613.12 → 2615.42] and also to the Gentiles.
[2615.42 → 2617.74] I think that's so great.
[2618.84 → 2620.70] So it's a call to pray for Jerusalem,
[2620.92 → 2621.88] to care about Jerusalem,
[2621.96 → 2622.82] to seek its prosperity.
[2623.50 → 2624.36] We pray for the gospel
[2624.36 → 2625.20] to go forth there.
[2625.60 → 2627.26] But it's a call to pray also
[2627.26 → 2628.88] for the peace of the church.
[2629.62 → 2631.10] Christians have always read this
[2631.10 → 2631.86] as a call
[2631.86 → 2633.22] not only to pray for
[2633.22 → 2634.90] actual, to save Jerusalem,
[2635.02 → 2636.14] but to pray for the church.
[2636.54 → 2637.74] Because we too
[2637.74 → 2639.66] have a lot of divisions.
[2641.08 → 2641.78] Now it's true
[2641.78 → 2643.16] that on the one hand
[2643.16 → 2644.88] and at the most fundamental level,
[2645.42 → 2647.08] the church is actually united.
[2647.96 → 2649.36] There is only one
[2649.36 → 2650.54] universal church,
[2650.66 → 2651.58] one holy Catholic
[2651.58 → 2652.90] and apostolic church
[2652.90 → 2654.38] of all people
[2654.38 → 2655.84] in all times
[2655.84 → 2656.66] and all places.
[2657.34 → 2658.76] And when we gather to worship,
[2658.88 → 2659.68] we are all gathered
[2659.68 → 2660.82] in the same place
[2660.82 → 2662.42] in the heavenly Jerusalem.
[2663.24 → 2664.36] And we actually see
[2664.36 → 2665.18] a hint of this
[2665.18 → 2666.86] in Psalm 122 as well.
[2667.32 → 2668.50] Verse 4 says,
[2668.88 → 2670.00] Jerusalem is where
[2670.00 → 2671.38] the tribes go up,
[2671.50 → 2672.74] the tribes of the Lord.
[2673.44 → 2674.78] Think about the tribes of Israel.
[2675.42 → 2676.58] The people of ancient Israel
[2676.58 → 2677.48] were divided into
[2677.48 → 2678.56] twelve different tribes.
[2679.20 → 2680.48] They all lived on the same
[2680.48 → 2681.24] law of God,
[2681.36 → 2682.32] but over time,
[2682.62 → 2683.22] they would have
[2683.22 → 2683.90] their own customs,
[2684.02 → 2684.58] their own history,
[2684.74 → 2686.14] there was some hostility
[2686.14 → 2686.88] in different times
[2686.88 → 2688.18] and places between them.
[2688.96 → 2690.24] But when they went up
[2690.24 → 2690.96] to Jerusalem,
[2690.96 → 2692.26] all the tribes
[2692.26 → 2693.96] went up together
[2693.96 → 2695.54] to worship the Lord
[2695.54 → 2696.16] together.
[2697.06 → 2697.56] And likewise,
[2697.84 → 2699.22] when we get to heaven,
[2699.22 → 2702.40] all the tribes
[2702.40 → 2703.30] of the church
[2703.30 → 2704.02] are going up.
[2704.12 → 2704.24] You know,
[2704.28 → 2705.28] there's not going to be
[2705.28 → 2706.40] a place in heaven
[2706.40 → 2708.22] just for Reformed Christians.
[2708.86 → 2709.76] Then over there,
[2709.86 → 2711.22] a place for the Baptist Christians
[2711.22 → 2712.38] and the Anglicans.
[2712.86 → 2714.22] We're all going to be
[2714.22 → 2715.50] one family there
[2715.50 → 2716.12] in heaven
[2716.12 → 2717.14] because we are
[2717.14 → 2717.92] one family
[2717.92 → 2719.22] here now.
[2720.92 → 2722.40] But that unity
[2722.40 → 2723.04] of the church
[2723.04 → 2724.58] is kind of where it ends.
[2724.58 → 2726.58] because here on earth,
[2726.68 → 2727.42] we're much closer
[2727.42 → 2729.06] to what the old hymn says,
[2729.56 → 2731.30] by schisms rent asunder,
[2731.90 → 2733.68] by heresies distressed.
[2735.74 → 2736.46] So friends,
[2736.50 → 2736.96] when we pray
[2736.96 → 2738.12] for the peace of Jerusalem,
[2738.24 → 2738.64] we're praying
[2738.64 → 2739.96] for the unity of the church.
[2740.46 → 2740.88] We're praying
[2740.88 → 2741.46] for the healing
[2741.46 → 2742.24] of the divisions
[2742.24 → 2743.06] of the church
[2743.06 → 2743.88] and the wounds
[2743.88 → 2745.22] that come from that.
[2746.06 → 2746.76] I want to share
[2746.76 → 2747.40] with you a quote
[2747.40 → 2748.86] by the pastor
[2748.86 → 2749.68] Charles Spurgeon.
[2751.12 → 2752.24] This is what he writes.
[2752.46 → 2752.68] He says,
[2752.68 → 2753.66] Note that Israel
[2753.66 → 2755.00] was one people,
[2755.60 → 2756.56] but yet it was
[2756.56 → 2757.68] in a sense divided
[2757.68 → 2759.22] by the mere surface
[2759.22 → 2761.10] distinction of tribes.
[2761.56 → 2762.50] And this may be
[2762.50 → 2763.48] a lesson to us
[2763.48 → 2765.20] that all Christendom
[2765.20 → 2766.30] is essentially one,
[2766.74 → 2767.98] though from various causes
[2767.98 → 2768.76] we are divided
[2768.76 → 2769.50] into tribes.
[2770.16 → 2771.52] Let us as much as possible
[2771.52 → 2772.66] sink the tribal
[2772.66 → 2773.76] individuality
[2773.76 → 2775.98] in the national unity
[2775.98 → 2777.42] so that the church
[2777.42 → 2778.00] may be
[2778.00 → 2779.50] many waves
[2779.50 → 2780.34] but one sea,
[2781.18 → 2781.98] many branches
[2781.98 → 2783.00] but one tree,
[2783.76 → 2784.74] many members
[2784.74 → 2786.18] but one body.
[2788.40 → 2789.36] And so we need
[2789.36 → 2790.18] to pray regularly,
[2790.66 → 2790.98] daily,
[2791.18 → 2792.08] not just for Jerusalem
[2792.08 → 2793.34] but also for
[2793.34 → 2794.70] the church
[2794.70 → 2796.22] that a love
[2796.22 → 2797.28] that transcends
[2797.28 → 2798.64] all of our denominational
[2798.64 → 2799.84] and racial divisions
[2799.84 → 2801.80] would prevail,
[2802.04 → 2802.84] that we would
[2802.84 → 2803.78] in some ways
[2803.78 → 2804.60] experience
[2804.60 → 2806.42] being the church
[2806.42 → 2807.54] of Jesus Christ
[2807.54 → 2808.16] on earth
[2808.16 → 2809.24] together.
[2809.24 → 2809.34] together.
[2810.52 → 2811.74] And why do we do that?
[2811.82 → 2812.78] Why is that so important?
[2812.92 → 2813.42] I mean, of course,
[2813.52 → 2814.38] it makes sense,
[2814.44 → 2815.36] it's the right thing to do,
[2815.46 → 2816.40] but remember also
[2816.40 → 2817.22] what Jesus said.
[2818.04 → 2818.44] Jesus said,
[2818.52 → 2819.38] all people will know
[2819.38 → 2821.00] that you are my disciples
[2821.00 → 2822.40] if what?
[2823.52 → 2825.10] If we kind of maintain
[2825.10 → 2826.24] our doctrinal distinctions?
[2827.34 → 2828.18] That's what we
[2828.18 → 2829.22] sometimes act like,
[2829.26 → 2829.70] he said,
[2829.70 → 2831.08] but what Jesus said
[2831.08 → 2831.38] was,
[2831.38 → 2832.44] all people will know
[2832.44 → 2833.64] that you are my disciples
[2833.64 → 2835.52] if you love one another.
[2836.42 → 2837.32] Talking to
[2837.32 → 2838.28] fellow,
[2839.04 → 2840.46] all those who follow him.
[2841.16 → 2841.98] And our failure
[2841.98 → 2843.26] to obey that command
[2843.26 → 2845.54] has been
[2845.54 → 2846.58] a serious impediment
[2846.58 → 2847.24] to the witness
[2847.24 → 2847.70] and the mission
[2847.70 → 2848.30] of the church.
[2849.80 → 2850.88] So let's pray
[2850.88 → 2852.32] for the church
[2852.32 → 2853.28] and let's seek
[2853.28 → 2854.06] the prosperity
[2854.06 → 2855.86] of the church.
[2856.74 → 2858.12] So let me sum things up here
[2858.12 → 2859.16] and then just talk about
[2859.16 → 2860.26] one more point of application.
[2861.16 → 2861.72] We're studying
[2861.72 → 2862.76] the Psalms of Ascent.
[2863.72 → 2864.54] They're all about
[2864.54 → 2865.82] pilgrim discipleship.
[2866.54 → 2867.12] They're all about
[2867.12 → 2868.12] learning about
[2868.12 → 2868.82] this pilgrimage
[2868.82 → 2869.96] that we are on
[2869.96 → 2871.14] and they're all about
[2871.14 → 2871.90] learning what it means
[2871.90 → 2872.86] to walk with Jesus,
[2873.70 → 2875.36] following the way of Jesus,
[2876.06 → 2877.10] and on the path
[2877.10 → 2878.48] in which Jesus leads us.
[2879.06 → 2879.56] So in here,
[2879.64 → 2880.60] in Psalm 122,
[2880.80 → 2881.98] we're talking about worship.
[2882.94 → 2883.92] One of the most basic
[2883.92 → 2885.28] and foundational
[2885.28 → 2886.42] and most indispensable
[2886.42 → 2887.90] aspects of following Jesus
[2887.90 → 2889.24] is that we are people
[2889.24 → 2890.14] who are worshipping
[2890.14 → 2891.14] in heaven
[2891.14 → 2894.00] as one united family
[2894.00 → 2894.54] of God.
[2895.50 → 2897.16] And we are here
[2897.16 → 2898.68] and now to live that out
[2898.68 → 2899.96] by gathering
[2899.96 → 2901.32] to worship on Sundays
[2901.32 → 2902.44] in which we are
[2902.44 → 2904.06] participating in
[2904.06 → 2904.80] and experiencing
[2904.80 → 2905.94] a foretaste
[2905.94 → 2907.56] of the spiritual reality
[2907.56 → 2908.52] that we are worshipping
[2908.52 → 2909.40] God in heaven
[2909.40 → 2911.02] and by praying
[2911.02 → 2912.60] for the unity
[2912.60 → 2913.38] of the church.
[2913.46 → 2913.92] And even though,
[2914.06 → 2914.16] of course,
[2914.22 → 2915.14] we gather as local
[2915.14 → 2916.00] congregations,
[2916.00 → 2918.20] we have
[2918.20 → 2919.50] our doctrinal
[2919.50 → 2920.06] distinctions
[2920.06 → 2920.86] of what we believe
[2920.86 → 2921.70] that the Bible teaches
[2921.70 → 2922.40] and that's all right
[2922.40 → 2922.82] and good.
[2923.22 → 2924.04] But there's this other
[2924.04 → 2925.02] thing that we also
[2925.02 → 2925.88] need to keep in balance
[2925.88 → 2927.10] is that we are part
[2927.10 → 2928.76] of a larger church
[2928.76 → 2929.96] that extends beyond
[2929.96 → 2930.44] the borders
[2930.44 → 2931.84] of our denomination
[2931.84 → 2932.78] and beyond the borders
[2932.78 → 2933.94] of this building.
[2936.34 → 2937.78] I rejoiced
[2937.78 → 2938.54] with those who said
[2938.54 → 2938.82] to me,
[2938.92 → 2939.84] let us go to the house
[2939.84 → 2940.32] of the Lord.
[2940.52 → 2941.44] So here's my question
[2941.44 → 2942.26] for us this morning.
[2942.26 → 2944.54] Do you rejoice
[2944.54 → 2945.28] to go to the house
[2945.28 → 2945.72] of the Lord?
[2947.00 → 2948.50] Do you rejoice
[2948.50 → 2950.66] to worship
[2950.66 → 2951.26] on Sundays?
[2951.98 → 2953.20] Is that a central
[2953.20 → 2955.42] reality in your life?
[2955.52 → 2955.74] Of course,
[2955.78 → 2956.26] I'm kind of preaching
[2956.26 → 2956.78] to the choir,
[2956.90 → 2957.24] aren't I?
[2959.22 → 2960.38] But Eugene Peterson
[2960.38 → 2961.16] says this,
[2962.16 → 2963.24] one of the afflictions
[2963.24 → 2964.20] of pastoral work
[2964.20 → 2965.98] has been to listen
[2965.98 → 2967.48] with a straight face
[2967.48 → 2968.84] to all the reasons
[2968.84 → 2969.44] people give
[2969.44 → 2970.54] for not going to church.
[2970.54 → 2972.06] There are too many
[2972.06 → 2973.02] hypocrites in the church.
[2973.50 → 2974.18] It's the only day
[2974.18 → 2975.14] I have to sleep in.
[2976.10 → 2976.78] There was a time
[2976.78 → 2977.54] when I responded
[2977.54 → 2978.48] to such statements
[2978.48 → 2980.66] with simple arguments
[2980.66 → 2981.96] that exposed them
[2981.96 → 2983.36] as flimsy excuses.
[2984.30 → 2985.18] Then I noticed
[2985.18 → 2985.88] that it didn't make
[2985.88 → 2986.44] any difference.
[2987.26 → 2987.80] If I showed
[2987.80 → 2988.74] the inadequacy
[2988.74 → 2989.44] of one excuse,
[2989.60 → 2990.86] three more would pop up
[2990.86 → 2992.06] in its place.
[2992.86 → 2994.24] So I don't respond anymore.
[2994.90 → 2995.48] I listen
[2995.48 → 2997.44] and go home
[2997.44 → 2998.08] and pray
[2998.08 → 2999.10] that person
[2999.10 → 3000.10] will one day
[3000.10 → 3001.52] find the one
[3001.52 → 3002.66] sufficient reason
[3002.66 → 3003.72] for going to church,
[3003.94 → 3005.20] which is God.
[3007.02 → 3007.74] And then Peterson
[3007.74 → 3008.86] goes on to say,
[3009.06 → 3010.10] Psalm 122
[3010.10 → 3010.86] is a song
[3010.86 → 3011.50] of a person
[3011.50 → 3012.22] who decides
[3012.22 → 3013.12] to go to church
[3013.12 → 3014.52] and to worship God
[3014.52 → 3015.88] because he or she
[3015.88 → 3016.70] wants to.
[3017.74 → 3018.72] An excellent way
[3018.72 → 3020.24] to test people's values
[3020.24 → 3021.04] is to observe
[3021.04 → 3022.52] what we do
[3022.52 → 3023.26] when we don't
[3023.26 → 3024.42] have to do anything.
[3024.42 → 3026.68] You know,
[3026.72 → 3027.14] I think there's
[3027.14 → 3028.60] a commentary here
[3028.60 → 3030.38] about those days
[3030.38 → 3031.46] when we are not
[3031.46 → 3032.38] feeling it.
[3033.46 → 3033.70] Right?
[3033.76 → 3034.44] All of us have
[3034.44 → 3035.26] those days
[3035.26 → 3036.94] when emotionally
[3036.94 → 3037.62] we don't want
[3037.62 → 3038.16] to be here
[3038.16 → 3039.12] for one reason
[3039.12 → 3039.82] or another.
[3040.66 → 3041.72] I have those days too.
[3041.90 → 3042.68] Don't be surprised.
[3044.80 → 3045.56] I'm not sure
[3045.56 → 3047.36] also that there were,
[3047.46 → 3048.82] I'm sure there were times
[3048.82 → 3049.94] for ancient Israel
[3049.94 → 3050.96] that they would say,
[3051.18 → 3052.20] I don't want to go
[3052.20 → 3052.86] to Jerusalem
[3052.86 → 3054.26] this year.
[3054.90 → 3055.92] We've done this before.
[3057.44 → 3058.70] But it's really
[3058.70 → 3059.60] not about
[3059.60 → 3061.50] what I feel,
[3061.64 → 3061.98] it's not about
[3061.98 → 3062.58] what we feel.
[3063.06 → 3063.18] Right?
[3063.26 → 3063.96] Peterson goes on
[3063.96 → 3064.54] to say that
[3064.54 → 3065.48] our feelings
[3065.48 → 3067.02] can lie to us.
[3067.80 → 3068.54] The real test
[3068.54 → 3069.42] of what we value,
[3069.76 → 3070.38] the real test
[3070.38 → 3071.36] of what we love,
[3071.72 → 3073.04] is not how we feel
[3073.04 → 3074.30] but how we act.
[3075.54 → 3075.66] Right?
[3075.72 → 3076.46] God calls us
[3076.46 → 3077.14] to worship him.
[3078.14 → 3079.14] And when we gather
[3079.14 → 3079.74] in worship,
[3079.94 → 3080.08] right,
[3080.12 → 3080.90] we gather to hear
[3080.90 → 3081.52] God's word,
[3081.88 → 3082.98] we gather around
[3082.98 → 3083.66] his table,
[3083.66 → 3084.22] we gather
[3084.22 → 3085.24] in fellowship
[3085.24 → 3086.24] with one another
[3086.24 → 3087.68] to sing God's praises
[3087.68 → 3089.30] and as we do so
[3089.30 → 3090.44] in obedience to God,
[3090.50 → 3091.94] the statutes of the Lord,
[3092.20 → 3093.20] it says in the psalm,
[3093.62 → 3094.54] as we do so,
[3094.72 → 3095.78] we receive
[3095.78 → 3096.90] and we experience
[3096.90 → 3098.00] God's grace
[3098.00 → 3098.64] in our lives.
[3099.08 → 3099.92] And so worship
[3099.92 → 3101.24] not only is expressive
[3101.24 → 3102.22] of how we feel,
[3102.68 → 3103.70] whether in lament
[3103.70 → 3104.64] or in praise
[3104.64 → 3105.12] and joy,
[3105.62 → 3106.84] it's also formative.
[3106.84 → 3108.62] as we come
[3108.62 → 3110.12] and we enact
[3110.12 → 3110.86] the discipline
[3110.86 → 3111.54] of worship,
[3111.66 → 3112.44] we become
[3112.44 → 3113.44] more and more
[3113.44 → 3115.22] God's worshipping people.
[3115.90 → 3116.50] And so my prayer
[3116.50 → 3117.26] for us is that,
[3117.40 → 3118.72] is that we would
[3118.72 → 3119.82] be the people
[3119.82 → 3120.70] who say,
[3121.08 → 3121.42] I rejoiced
[3122.08 → 3122.82] with those
[3122.82 → 3123.52] who said to me,
[3123.70 → 3124.50] let us go
[3124.50 → 3125.02] to the house
[3125.02 → 3125.44] of the Lord.
[3126.32 → 3126.60] Okay,
[3126.64 → 3127.34] let's pray together.
[3127.34 → 3127.40] Let's pray together.
[3127.40 → 3132.66] Father,
[3132.82 → 3133.38] we thank you
[3133.38 → 3135.02] for this joyful psalm
[3135.02 → 3138.18] and that we can
[3138.18 → 3140.88] take up this cry
[3140.88 → 3143.64] that we've read here
[3143.64 → 3144.54] that has given,
[3144.72 → 3145.34] come down to us
[3145.34 → 3147.10] from so many centuries ago
[3147.10 → 3149.62] that we would rejoice
[3149.62 → 3151.20] to go to the house
[3151.20 → 3151.66] of the Lord.
[3153.28 → 3153.72] And so Lord,
[3153.78 → 3154.88] may that be true of us
[3154.88 → 3156.22] as Ladder CRC
[3156.22 → 3157.88] and Lord,
[3157.94 → 3158.66] we do seek
[3158.66 → 3160.32] the unity
[3160.32 → 3161.24] not only of us
[3161.24 → 3162.04] as a congregation
[3162.04 → 3163.68] which we do need
[3163.68 → 3165.26] and not only
[3165.26 → 3165.88] the unity
[3165.88 → 3166.66] of churches
[3166.66 → 3167.84] here in Ladder
[3167.84 → 3169.62] which would be
[3169.62 → 3170.50] a powerful witness
[3170.50 → 3171.04] to you,
[3171.56 → 3171.88] but Lord,
[3171.94 → 3172.96] we seek the unity
[3172.96 → 3174.04] of your church worldwide
[3174.04 → 3175.76] that you would be
[3175.76 → 3176.94] forming all of us
[3176.94 → 3178.38] into your worshipping people
[3178.38 → 3179.56] as is true already
[3179.56 → 3180.12] right now
[3180.12 → 3180.86] in heaven.
[3181.74 → 3181.96] Lord,
[3182.02 → 3182.82] make that a reality
[3182.82 → 3183.72] in our hearts,
[3183.90 → 3184.52] in our church,
[3184.62 → 3186.14] and around the world.
[3186.80 → 3188.12] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3188.84 → 3189.14] Amen.
[3190.64 → 3191.12] All right,
[3191.18 → 3192.68] so let's sing together
[3192.68 → 3195.02] our song of response
[3195.02 → 3195.62] to our message
[3195.62 → 3197.68] and if you'd like to stand,
[3197.82 → 3198.84] if you've been sitting too long,
[3198.94 → 3199.48] feel free.
[3199.48 → 3213.04] no more of a person
[3213.04 → 3213.74] or so
[3213.74 → 3213.82] we'll have
[3213.82 → 3214.48] you
[3214.48 → 3214.72] don't know
[3214.72 → 3215.20] who's
[3215.20 → 3216.06] but we'll be
[3216.06 → 3216.46] not
[3216.46 → 3217.28] as
[3217.28 → 3217.98] just
[3217.98 → 3218.96] as
[3218.96 → 3220.96] Amen.
[3248.96 → 3250.96] Amen.
[3278.96 → 3287.60] Posting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed,
[3288.12 → 3296.56] finding as we promised perfect peace and rest.
[3298.46 → 3306.46] Hidden in the hollow of His mighty hand,
[3306.46 → 3314.76] where no harm can follow, in His strength we stand.
[3315.50 → 3322.94] We may trust Him fully, all for us to do.
[3323.98 → 3331.28] Those who trust Him wholly, find Him wholly true.
[3331.28 → 3340.64] Posting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed,
[3341.14 → 3349.28] finding as He promised perfect peace and rest.
[3350.32 → 3357.28] Posting in the Father, hearts are fully blessed,
[3357.28 → 3368.24] finding as He promised perfect peace and rest.
[3368.24 → 3371.54] You may be seated.
[3373.80 → 3376.68] So we come now to our time of prayer.
[3377.40 → 3383.00] Let's pray for the church and for the world.
[3383.64 → 3385.08] So we'll pray for a couple of things today.
[3385.20 → 3386.00] We're going to pray for fathers.
[3387.04 → 3388.12] We're going to pray for Jerusalem.
[3389.38 → 3390.82] And so let's pray for those things.
[3390.82 → 3396.00] Dear Heavenly Father, on this Father's Day,
[3397.00 → 3403.44] it is a joy to acknowledge that You are the Father we've always longed for and needed.
[3404.32 → 3411.76] Our most loving and engaged fathers have been a wonderful hint of what it means to be Your beloved children.
[3411.76 → 3415.88] But they can never be to us what You alone can be.
[3416.72 → 3424.28] And our most broken and irresponsible fathers cannot rob our hearts of the joys we find in knowing You and crying,
[3424.62 → 3425.20] Abba, Father.
[3426.32 → 3430.34] Thank You for adopting us through the finished work of Jesus.
[3431.38 → 3436.96] Thank You for freeing us from slavery to sin and our orphan-like ways.
[3436.96 → 3442.82] And for giving us the spirit of son ship, a secure place in Your family,
[3443.54 → 3448.18] and an inheritance that can never spoil or fade, kept in heaven for us.
[3449.58 → 3453.36] Thank You for promising to complete the work You began in us,
[3453.96 → 3459.94] and for always and only discipling us in love, even when it hurts.
[3459.94 → 3468.14] Father, thank You for the grace to forgive our earthly fathers when they have failed us,
[3468.22 → 3474.96] including those who have broken our trust or hurt us and misrepresented You to us.
[3475.90 → 3480.10] Continue to heal us and free us from lingering effects.
[3480.90 → 3487.94] And thank You for grace to acknowledge our own failings as fathers and parents,
[3487.94 → 3494.52] and for promising us the strength we need to humble ourselves before our children,
[3495.06 → 3501.16] and to trust You to write stories of redemption in our families.
[3502.06 → 3504.38] Please do so, Father, to Your glory.
[3506.06 → 3510.42] And lastly, Father, we thank You for the spiritual fathers that You have given us,
[3511.20 → 3512.90] the dads of grace,
[3513.24 → 3517.46] who help us to discover more and more of Your love for us.
[3517.94 → 3524.54] And Father, we also pray for Jerusalem.
[3525.56 → 3527.64] Lord Jesus, You are the Prince of Peace.
[3528.50 → 3535.56] We bring to You our prayers for the land of Your birth and the land of Your ministry.
[3535.56 → 3541.26] As individuals and as part of the body of Christ, we bring these to you.
[3542.02 → 3546.38] As Christians, we share a history rooted in the Holy Land.
[3546.50 → 3550.42] And as we, Your people, are united with them,
[3550.54 → 3554.10] we also share in worship and in prayer.
[3554.10 → 3563.08] And so we are dismayed when we see Jerusalem filled with violence and weeping filling the streets.
[3563.26 → 3571.48] And so whether it is just the conflict that is simmering on without the attracting international attention,
[3571.48 → 3575.06] or when we see it becoming headline news.
[3576.66 → 3580.42] Lord, in all the violence we seek, Lord, we pray for peace to come.
[3580.68 → 3582.76] Lord, we pray that Your justice would prevail.
[3583.22 → 3586.76] And let there be safety and security for all the people in the Holy Land.
[3586.76 → 3589.18] And we pray for peace in the Holy Land.
[3589.88 → 3594.80] A peace that in the short term would bring continual ceasefire.
[3595.46 → 3602.32] And a peace in the long term that would be built on the reign acknowledgement of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3602.42 → 3605.16] In the hearts and minds of all who live and work there.
[3605.16 → 3612.20] And likewise, Lord, we pray for the peace and the unity of Your church around the world.
[3613.06 → 3616.38] But especially, Lord, we ask for unity of the church in Latin or in Delta.
[3617.10 → 3621.32] And even while we hold to our doctrinal distinctions,
[3621.82 → 3626.52] may You also remind us that for most we are one body in Christ.
[3627.20 → 3632.92] Would You give us opportunities to experience this unity that we have here
[3632.92 → 3642.50] so that we might be Your witnesses in Latin or to Your love for us and in our love for one another.
[3644.34 → 3652.06] So, Father, for these things, our fathers, and for the mother city of Jerusalem,
[3652.50 → 3658.26] for the church, all of these things, and many more, Lord, we lift to You.
[3658.68 → 3660.08] And You know all that we need.
[3660.08 → 3662.56] And we pray in Jesus' merciful and mighty name.
[3663.50 → 3663.82] Amen.
[3666.74 → 3669.64] And, so please stand with me, if you are able and willing,
[3670.32 → 3672.84] and receive this blessing from the Lord.
[3672.92 → 3675.34] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture.
[3675.48 → 3678.46] We're receiving this blessing from 1 Timothy.
[3678.88 → 3683.74] To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God,
[3684.40 → 3687.14] be honour and glory forever and ever.
[3687.78 → 3688.12] Amen.
[3688.12 → 3692.28] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[3692.28 → 3713.76] Father, we love you.
[3713.76 → 3718.76] We worship and adore you.
[3718.76 → 3719.16] We worship and adore you.
[3719.16 → 3728.44] Glorify your name and all the earth.
[3728.44 → 3734.14] Glorify your name and all the earth.

[3793.24 → 3798.88] We worship, we adore you.
[3799.46 → 3808.74] Glorify your name in all the ways.
