[345.00 → 347.00] Well, good morning.
[347.00 → 348.00] Good morning.
[348.00 → 352.00] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church, the second Sunday of Advent.
[352.00 → 356.00] My name is Ryan, and I will be helping leading us in worship this morning.
[356.00 → 363.00] Once again, we'll be welcoming Pastor Len to the pulpit to bring us God's word from 1 Thessalonians 5.
[363.00 → 368.00] And just a couple of quick announcements before we get into the service here.
[368.00 → 374.00] First, after much anticipation, we will be collecting our Faith Promise Giving forms.
[374.00 → 378.00] That will happen after the service on the way out at the door.
[378.00 → 384.00] And second, as Jason emailed out earlier this week, masks are mandatory.
[384.00 → 392.00] So, please just respect that, and we'll be keeping them on at all times other than during communion.
[392.00 → 400.00] So, and then lastly, our offering for this morning is for the Abbotsford Disaster Relief Fund.
[400.00 → 406.00] Obviously, a very important offering and something that's close to a lot of people here.
[406.00 → 409.00] So, please give generously to that.
[409.00 → 414.00] As usual, we won't be passing the collection plate, but you know what to do at this point.
[414.00 → 416.00] Offerings at the back or online.
[416.00 → 422.00] So, now, let us come before our God.
[422.00 → 428.00] Whether you're here out of habit, or it's your first time.
[428.00 → 432.00] Whether you're here because you have to be, or because you want to be.
[432.00 → 436.00] We are glad that you answered the call of our Creator.
[436.00 → 440.00] If you are able, I'd ask you to please stand for our call to worship.
[440.00 → 451.00] In Christ, the God of heaven, who has made his home on earth.
[451.00 → 454.00] Christ dwells among us, and is one with us.
[454.00 → 457.00] Highest of all creation, he lives among the least.
[457.00 → 461.00] He journeys with the rejected, and welcomes the weary.
[461.00 → 466.00] Come now, all who thirst, and drink of the water of life.
[466.00 → 470.00] Come now, all who hunger, and be filled with good things.
[470.00 → 474.00] Come now, all who seek, and be warmed with the fire of his love.
[474.00 → 479.00] Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[479.00 → 483.00] who gave himself for our sins, and set us free from the present evil age.
[483.00 → 488.00] According to the will of God our Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever.
[488.00 → 489.00] Amen.
[489.00 → 492.00] Now let us take a moment to greet one another.
[492.00 → 496.00] Say hello to our pew neighbours, and then we'll join together in song.
[519.00 → 520.00] Come excited and welcome again, you sing.
[520.00 → 521.00] Thank you always sing.
[521.00 → 525.00] Thank you.
[525.00 → 543.02] Are you hurting and broken within?
[543.48 → 547.14] Overwhelmed by the ways of your sin?
[547.14 → 549.90] Jesus is calling.
[549.90 → 556.90] Have you come to the end of yourself?
[557.46 → 561.12] Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[561.68 → 563.82] Jesus is calling.
[566.02 → 569.80] O come to the altar.
[570.70 → 575.10] The Father sums our open wide.
[575.10 → 585.44] Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[587.10 → 594.26] Leave behind your regrets and mistakes.
[594.66 → 598.58] Come today, there's no reason to wait.
[598.58 → 601.18] Jesus is calling.
[603.56 → 607.58] Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy.
[608.54 → 612.70] From the ashes a new life is born.
[613.16 → 615.12] Jesus is calling.
[617.44 → 620.58] O come to the altar.
[620.58 → 626.92] The Father sums our open wide.
[627.04 → 636.58] Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[636.58 → 641.58] O what a Saviour.
[643.58 → 647.32] Isn't he wonderful?
[648.32 → 650.76] Sing hallelujah.
[651.84 → 653.92] Christ is risen.
[653.92 → 665.92] Come to the altar.
[665.92 → 668.92] Sing hallelujah.
[668.92 → 671.92] Christ is risen.
[671.92 → 678.92] Come to the altar.
[678.92 → 683.92] The Father's arms are open wide.
[683.92 → 694.92] Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[694.92 → 704.82] Be your cross as you wait for the crown.
[704.92 → 709.92] Tell the world of the treasure you found.
[709.92 → 713.86] God!
[713.92 → 718.92] O Lord...
[718.92 → 736.94] In our days that God has conquered, I was made to walk within.
[736.94 → 746.84] Yet I look for worldly treasure and forsake the King of kings.
[746.84 → 756.70] My mind is hope in my Redeemer, though I fall, His love is sure.
[756.70 → 767.70] For Christ has made for every failing, I am His forevermore.
[767.70 → 769.70] Amen.
[769.70 → 778.76] Mine are tears in times of sorrow, darkness not yet understood.
[778.76 → 789.76] Through the valley I must travel, where I see no earthly good.
[790.16 → 799.96] The mind is peace that flows from heaven, endless strength in times of need.
[799.96 → 810.96] I know my pain will not be wasted, Christ completes His work in me.
[810.96 → 822.96] Mine are days here as a stranger, filled with love on a narrow way.
[822.96 → 833.82] One with Christ I will encounter, arm and hatred for His name.
[833.82 → 843.82] But might His armour for this battle, strong enough to last the war.
[843.82 → 854.82] And He has said He will deliver, safely to the golden shore.
[854.82 → 865.74] And mine are keys to Zion City, where beside the King I walk.
[865.74 → 876.82] For there my heart has found His treasure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[876.82 → 883.82] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[883.82 → 885.82] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[885.82 → 888.82] For His love is my reward.
[888.82 → 894.82] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[894.82 → 895.82] Christ is mine forevermore.
[895.82 → 907.82] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[907.82 → 908.82] For His love is my reward.
[908.82 → 909.82] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[909.82 → 913.82] Christ is mine forevermore.
[913.82 → 916.76] And hope is sure
[916.76 → 919.82] Christ is mine
[919.82 → 921.82] Forevermore
[922.52 → 924.94] And mine are keys
[924.94 → 927.94] To Zion's city
[927.94 → 933.04] Where beside the King I walk
[933.04 → 934.82] For there my heart
[935.68 → 937.82] Has found his treasure
[938.56 → 940.82] Christ is mine
[941.34 → 942.82] Forevermore
[943.82 → 945.82] Christ is mine
[946.88 → 948.82] Forevermore
[949.60 → 951.82] Christ is mine
[952.68 → 955.82] Forevermore
[973.82 → 975.82] Christ is mine
[975.82 → 976.82] Forevermore
[976.82 → 977.82] Christ is mine
[977.82 → 978.82] Forever
[978.82 → 979.82] Christ is mine
[979.82 → 980.82] Forever
[980.82 → 995.82] Every year we light candles as we prepare for the coming of Christ
[995.82 → 998.82] More and more candles we light
[998.82 → 999.82] More and more candles we light
[999.82 → 1000.82] More and more light
[1000.82 → 1001.82] As we watch and wait for Jesus
[1001.82 → 1003.82] Every year we light
[1003.82 → 1008.82] Every year we light candles as we prepare for the coming of Christ
[1008.82 → 1011.82] More and more candles we light
[1011.82 → 1013.82] More and more light
[1013.82 → 1014.82] More and more light
[1014.82 → 1016.82] As we watch and wait for Jesus
[1016.82 → 1018.82] The light of the world
[1018.82 → 1020.82] God of the world
[1020.82 → 1021.82] God of the world
[1021.82 → 1022.82] God of the world
[1022.82 → 1024.82] I'm coming for our heads
[1024.82 → 1025.82] Give me your hope
[1025.82 → 1026.82] And peace
[1026.82 → 1028.82] For you alone
[1028.82 → 1029.82] For you alone
[1029.82 → 1030.82] For the light of the dead
[1030.82 → 1031.82] For the dead
[1031.82 → 1035.82] Receive God's promise of peace from Psalm 4
[1035.82 → 1039.82] Know that the Lord has sent apart the godly for himself
[1039.82 → 1041.82] The Lord will hear when we call to him
[1041.82 → 1045.82] Let the light of the dead
[1045.82 → 1046.82] For the light of the dead
[1046.82 → 1047.82] Shine upon us
[1047.82 → 1048.82] Lord
[1048.82 → 1051.82] We will lie down and be in peace
[1051.82 → 1053.82] For you alone
[1053.82 → 1054.82] Lord
[1054.82 → 1055.82] May the dead
[1055.82 → 1056.82] Be in peace
[1071.82 → 1076.82] Let the Happy
[1076.82 → 1077.82] Forget about that
[1077.82 → 1078.82] May the dead
[1078.82 → 1079.82] May him
[1079.82 → 1080.82] UC
[1080.82 → 1081.82] Louisiana
[1081.82 → 1082.64] May he
[1082.64 → 1084.82] May he
[1084.82 → 1085.66] May he
[1085.66 → 1086.26] May he
[1086.26 → 1086.96] May he
[1086.96 → 1087.76] May he
[1087.76 → 1089.22] May he
[1089.22 → 1089.72] May he
[1089.72 → 1090.22] May
[1090.22 → 1091.52] Mayer
[1091.52 → 1092.66] May
[1092.66 → 1093.64] May he
[1093.64 → 1094.46] May he
[1094.46 → 1095.46] May
[1095.46 → 1098.38] L
[1098.54 → 1099.46] May
[1099.46 → 1100.64] May ch
[1100.64 → 1101.08] May
[1101.08 → 1101.38] May
[1101.38 → 1101.80] May
[1101.80 → 1120.56] Come the long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[1120.56 → 1131.40] From our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
[1131.80 → 1143.72] Israel's strength and consolation, hope of all the earth, thou art.
[1143.72 → 1155.72] Dear desire of every nation, joy of every longing heart.
[1155.72 → 1166.72] By thy people to deliver, born a child and yet a king.
[1166.92 → 1177.72] Born to reign in us forever, now thy gracious kingdom reign.
[1177.72 → 1189.84] By thine own eternal spirit, rule in all our hearts alone.
[1190.20 → 1201.16] By thine all-sufficient merit, raise us to thy glorious throne.
[1201.16 → 1212.72] So at this point, our children are dismissed to kids' life.
[1212.96 → 1215.04] That's ages three through grade seven.
[1215.70 → 1217.48] I guess at this point you probably know who you are.
[1218.48 → 1222.78] So may you and your teachers be blessed as you go and in all you do.
[1222.78 → 1239.26] Brothers and sisters of the Lord, we have been invited to bring our temptations, our failings,
[1239.84 → 1241.64] our sins before our God.
[1241.84 → 1248.56] We do not do this in order to be forgiven, but because we are already forgiven through Christ's
[1248.56 → 1248.84] blood.
[1249.56 → 1252.90] We can always rejoice and give thanks for our pardon.
[1253.46 → 1256.78] For once we were lost and now are found.
[1257.70 → 1263.34] Indeed, Jesus tells us that there is more rejoicing in heaven when one sinner repents than when
[1263.34 → 1266.58] 99 righteous people do not repent.
[1267.58 → 1270.06] Let us come now to our God in prayer.
[1270.06 → 1276.44] Holy God, we come before you this morning to confess our sins.
[1277.16 → 1283.70] As we stray from your kingdom work, we seek idols and plans that reflect our will rather
[1283.70 → 1284.30] than yours.
[1285.12 → 1290.20] Forgive the wickedness we have done and the goodness we have left undone.
[1291.54 → 1297.46] And yet we come to you this morning with joy because you, O Lord, are a merciful God.
[1297.46 → 1299.26] We thank you for the cross.
[1299.86 → 1305.10] We thank you for your son, Jesus, who suffered the justice that our sins deserved.
[1306.08 → 1311.30] Heavenly Father, guide us towards righteousness, the righteousness poured out through our Redeemer.
[1312.02 → 1314.56] Help us to discern what is good and true.
[1315.16 → 1317.62] And may everything we do be to your glory.
[1318.40 → 1318.66] Amen.
[1320.66 → 1326.58] Congregation of our Lord Jesus Christ, please join me in the proclamation of this good news from
[1326.58 → 1327.22] Isaiah 2.
[1327.46 → 1333.22] In the days to come, the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on the highest mountains
[1333.22 → 1337.34] and shall be raised above the hills and all nations shall stream to it.
[1337.90 → 1339.94] Many peoples shall come and say,
[1341.00 → 1346.94] Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of God, Jacob,
[1347.66 → 1352.36] and he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.
[1352.36 → 1358.18] For out of Zion shall go forth instruction and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
[1359.12 → 1360.64] He shall judge between nations.
[1360.80 → 1362.32] He shall arbitrate for many peoples.
[1362.68 → 1366.52] They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
[1367.06 → 1369.34] Nations shall not lift sword against nation.
[1369.92 → 1371.92] Neither shall they learn war anymore.
[1371.92 → 1377.68] For out of Zion shall be raised above the Lord.
[1377.68 → 1403.00] Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to him.
[1403.00 → 1413.00] No one else can satisfy, I should come to him.
[1413.76 → 1424.34] Jesus said if I am weak, I should come to him.
[1424.34 → 1430.96] No one else can be my strength.
[1430.96 → 1435.28] I should come to him.
[1435.90 → 1441.08] For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1441.68 → 1446.48] He will keep us day and night.
[1446.48 → 1452.10] We can always run to Jesus.
[1452.10 → 1457.64] Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1458.36 → 1468.86] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to him.
[1468.86 → 1474.60] No one else can be my shield.
[1474.60 → 1479.10] I should come to him.
[1479.10 → 1484.82] For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1484.82 → 1490.20] He will keep us day and night.
[1490.20 → 1495.74] We can always run to Jesus.
[1495.74 → 1501.48] Jesus strong and kind.
[1501.48 → 1512.32] Jesus said if I am lost, he will come to me.
[1512.32 → 1522.90] And he showed me on that cross, he will come to me.
[1522.90 → 1528.64] For the Lord is good and faithful.
[1528.64 → 1533.64] He will keep us day and night.
[1533.64 → 1539.74] We can always run to Jesus.
[1539.74 → 1545.90] Jesus strong and kind.
[1545.90 → 1551.70] Amen.
[1555.64 → 1558.48] At this point, I'd like to welcome up our scripture reader for this morning.
[1558.48 → 1562.28] I believe it's Hannah and then Pastor Lynn after that.
[1562.28 → 1562.34] Amen.
[1562.34 → 1562.94] Amen.
[1562.94 → 1564.08] Amen.
[1564.08 → 1564.26] Amen.
[1564.26 → 1564.52] Amen.
[1564.52 → 1564.56] Amen.
[1564.56 → 1564.96] Amen.
[1564.96 → 1565.28] Amen.
[1565.28 → 1565.42] Amen.
[1565.42 → 1565.46] Amen.
[1565.46 → 1565.64] Amen.
[1565.64 → 1566.00] Amen.
[1566.00 → 1566.26] Amen.
[1566.26 → 1566.36] Amen.
[1566.36 → 1566.86] Amen.
[1566.86 → 1567.00] Amen.
[1567.00 → 1567.06] Amen.

[1568.16 → 1568.20] Amen.

[1575.90 → 1605.86] Amen.
[1605.86 → 1612.22] 2 Peter. And it told about scoffers who were asking, you know, where is this coming that
[1612.22 → 1620.04] we are supposed to see? Jesus came and lived for a while among us, full of grace and truth.
[1620.64 → 1626.30] He did many wonderful things and taught many wonderful things. And then he died a sacrificial
[1626.30 → 1631.70] death. And then God raised him on the last day with the understanding that he would return.
[1631.70 → 1637.10] And, well, by the time Peter wrote a second letter, there were scoffers saying, well, when's
[1637.10 → 1644.26] it going to happen? And Peter made the point. God's time is different from ours. So it will
[1644.26 → 1650.42] happen. Now, today I want to take up a slightly different question. Understanding that Jesus
[1650.42 → 1659.52] will return, how should we behave? How should we live until he comes again? And to kind of
[1659.52 → 1666.66] draw that out, I'm going to read from the last part of 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5. And
[1666.66 → 1673.34] we'll be beginning at verse 12 and reading to verse 24. So this is kind of the ending of
[1673.34 → 1680.62] the letter. He's kind of giving his final instructions to the Thessalonians. And here's what he said.
[1680.98 → 1687.20] Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for
[1687.20 → 1693.00] you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work.
[1693.70 → 1700.48] Live in peace with each other. And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and
[1700.48 → 1709.58] disruptive. Encourage the disheartened. Help the weak. Be patient with everyone. Make sure that nobody pays
[1709.58 → 1714.58] back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
[1716.08 → 1724.52] Rejoice always. Pray continually. Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you
[1724.52 → 1732.12] in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt, but test them all.
[1732.12 → 1737.98] Hold on to what is good. Reject every kind of evil.
[1738.74 → 1744.92] And now especially this. May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.
[1745.46 → 1752.02] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1752.72 → 1756.82] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[1756.82 → 1758.70] This is the word of the Lord.
[1764.44 → 1769.18] Now, like many of you, I am the child of immigrants.
[1770.08 → 1780.00] My mother and father and my older sister came here to Canada in 1952, and then I was born a few years
[1780.00 → 1784.94] after that. And so, like some of you at least, I imagine,
[1784.94 → 1793.56] I never really got to know my grandparents. I mean, they were not around. They didn't bring me
[1793.56 → 1800.08] presents on my birthday. They didn't visit us at Christmastime. I mean, I did have grandparents,
[1800.38 → 1806.74] obviously. In fact, all of them were alive when I was born, but they were in the Netherlands,
[1806.74 → 1814.66] and I was a boy in Ontario. My mother's parents were actually quite old when I was born. I think my grandfather
[1814.66 → 1822.66] was already 80 at the time, and he never came to Canada, and we never went to the Netherlands and saw him.
[1823.52 → 1830.22] I never met my mother's mother either, and I didn't meet my father's mother.
[1830.22 → 1836.04] They all died in the Netherlands while I was growing up in Ontario.
[1837.66 → 1842.60] The one grandparent I did meet was my grandfather on my dad's side.
[1843.88 → 1850.40] I was his namesake, actually. He was Seifert, or Leo Bade rink, and I became Leonard Bade rink.
[1850.40 → 1859.20] And he came twice to Canada to visit. Now, the first time I don't remember, I was quite small,
[1860.08 → 1866.20] and although I've seen some pictures of him and us together, I have no memory of that.
[1866.98 → 1874.34] The second time he came, I was 10 years old, and I do remember that. He stayed for three months.
[1875.54 → 1879.08] My brother and I had to give up our bedrooms so he'd have a place to stay.
[1879.08 → 1885.96] He was old by then, and he was beginning to forget things already.
[1887.22 → 1892.46] He wore wooden undershirts even in the middle of summer in Ontario.
[1893.32 → 1901.52] He spoke no English. We were not allowed to play cards for the whole three months he was here
[1901.52 → 1907.16] because he objected to playing cards. He made me nervous.
[1907.16 → 1913.38] You know what they say about having the grandkids over for, you know, a couple of days or a week,
[1913.46 → 1918.96] that you're really happy to see them come, and at the end of the week, you're really happy to see them go?
[1920.06 → 1923.66] It was a little bit like that for my grandpa's visit.
[1923.94 → 1929.00] Now, I was so touched. My dad was so excited to have him there, so that made it all better.
[1929.00 → 1931.68] But he did kind of make me nervous.
[1932.80 → 1936.90] And actually, that nervousness began even before he came,
[1937.64 → 1946.60] because I couldn't help noticing that my mother and father had become stricter with us just in the weeks before.
[1946.60 → 1952.30] It wasn't like there were a lot of new rules, just that new rule about playing cards.
[1953.00 → 1957.72] But it's like the old rules were being enforced more.
[1958.92 → 1963.60] And I couldn't help feeling like we were trying to be prepared.
[1964.40 → 1968.84] We had to look good. We had to be presentable to my grandfather.
[1968.84 → 1973.74] Now, I don't remember my mother or father ever saying that,
[1973.86 → 1980.58] but, you know, the message kind of came out that when grandpa is here, you have to behave.
[1983.86 → 1990.98] Now, in our reading, there is a line that we can hear in the same way.
[1991.54 → 1994.10] You know, but it's not grandpa who's coming now.
[1994.26 → 1996.04] It's something much bigger than grandpa.
[1996.04 → 1998.12] But this is Jesus himself.
[1998.26 → 1999.54] He is coming.
[2000.72 → 2005.88] So this baby in Bethlehem, whose birth we celebrate in this time of the year,
[2006.46 → 2010.34] this baby who became a preacher and teacher and healer in Galilee,
[2010.52 → 2014.36] and then went down to Jerusalem and became the Lamb of God,
[2014.42 → 2016.38] who takes away the sin of the world,
[2016.76 → 2019.38] that Jesus will return.
[2020.78 → 2024.44] And so we have to behave.
[2024.44 → 2032.32] We have to behave in what we do, in what we say, and even in our thoughts.
[2033.34 → 2035.84] And Paul kind of points us that way.
[2035.92 → 2036.28] He says,
[2036.66 → 2044.48] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2045.60 → 2048.94] So here is a kind of Advent warning.
[2048.94 → 2054.18] When Jesus comes, you will behave.
[2057.00 → 2058.60] Now, what does that look like?
[2059.44 → 2062.26] Well, we don't hear anything about playing cards.
[2062.96 → 2068.52] But instead, being blameless at the coming of the Lord Jesus will look something like this.
[2068.52 → 2073.84] It means that we will respect those who work hard among us,
[2073.90 → 2078.36] that we will hold them in the highest regard in love.
[2078.36 → 2082.88] It means that we will live at peace with each other.
[2084.00 → 2086.58] It means that we will warn those who are idle,
[2087.12 → 2088.62] encourage the timid,
[2089.14 → 2090.18] help the weak,
[2090.68 → 2092.66] and be patient with everyone.
[2094.06 → 2097.58] It means that we should make sure nobody pays back wrong for wrong,
[2097.88 → 2102.22] but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.
[2102.22 → 2105.04] It means that we should be joyful always,
[2105.36 → 2107.36] that we should pray without ceasing,
[2107.88 → 2110.46] that we should be grateful for every good thing.
[2111.30 → 2113.34] We should not put out the Spirit's fire.
[2113.64 → 2115.82] We should not treat prophecies with contempt.
[2116.32 → 2117.86] We should test everything.
[2119.38 → 2123.48] And then at the end, Paul kind of wraps that all up by saying,
[2123.86 → 2126.02] Hold on to the good.
[2126.74 → 2129.36] Avoid every kind of evil.
[2129.36 → 2135.02] Now this is how we should behave as we wait for Jesus to come.
[2139.16 → 2140.62] Now when I read that,
[2141.12 → 2144.32] there are a couple of things that catch me.
[2145.28 → 2146.44] In the first place,
[2146.60 → 2151.16] I can't help hearing other parts of the Bible.
[2152.26 → 2155.64] I mean, I hear an echo of the Ten Commandments.
[2155.64 → 2159.74] I hear echoes of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
[2160.78 → 2167.40] I hear lines that the Apostle Paul will put into future letters.
[2168.46 → 2169.82] You know, by most reckonings,
[2170.20 → 2173.38] 1 Thessalonians was his first letter, the earliest.
[2174.26 → 2178.34] But he uses lines that keep coming back in later letters.
[2178.34 → 2185.96] It's kind of like we've got this short digest of life lessons from the Bible.
[2186.96 → 2191.82] And that's all included in this mood of constant joy,
[2192.02 → 2195.52] constant prayer, gratitude for every good thing.
[2196.82 → 2198.16] And then that last line,
[2198.38 → 2199.74] Hold on to the good.
[2199.88 → 2202.10] Avoid every kind of evil.
[2202.10 → 2203.94] Now when Jesus returns,
[2204.28 → 2208.62] we should be living by these biblical life lessons.
[2211.56 → 2214.22] Now the second thing that catches me here is that
[2214.22 → 2218.10] so much of this is about character.
[2219.50 → 2222.46] It's about the kind of people we are.
[2223.38 → 2225.06] The way we act.
[2225.26 → 2226.66] And the way we treat others.
[2226.70 → 2228.50] It's about honouring others.
[2228.58 → 2230.40] It's about pursuing peace.
[2230.40 → 2231.96] Even when people wrong us.
[2232.22 → 2233.28] Even when we've been hurt.
[2233.94 → 2237.28] It's about a joyful, positive view of life.
[2237.62 → 2240.20] It's about gratitude for every good gift.
[2240.34 → 2243.70] It's about being open-minded and open-hearted.
[2244.16 → 2247.58] It's about letting God take the lead.
[2249.48 → 2251.30] Now I would not call this
[2251.30 → 2256.02] like a formal job description for Christian people.
[2256.02 → 2259.80] You know, the applicant shall attend church weekly.
[2260.40 → 2263.82] And shall agree to volunteer whenever asked.
[2264.12 → 2266.74] And shall support the church's mission budget.
[2267.16 → 2268.42] And so on and so forth.
[2268.98 → 2271.04] I mean, this is definitely not a ministry plan.
[2271.28 → 2273.78] In year one, the applicant shall do this.
[2273.90 → 2276.02] In year two, the applicant shall do this.
[2276.12 → 2277.06] In year three, this.
[2277.14 → 2277.76] And so on.
[2278.50 → 2281.74] You know, I can remember doing projects like that in the past.
[2281.74 → 2286.90] I mean, experts were telling us that successful churches do this sort of thing.
[2287.02 → 2291.58] They set, they build a mission statement.
[2291.58 → 2294.24] And then they set goals and objectives.
[2294.52 → 2297.80] And these will be measurable goals and measurable objectives.
[2298.24 → 2301.22] And then they will regularly test themselves.
[2301.44 → 2305.94] Look at the numbers to see if they are achieving those goals and objectives.
[2305.94 → 2316.86] And if you think of the church as a sort of business that is marketing the Christian religion,
[2317.36 → 2319.68] then this makes good sense.
[2319.78 → 2321.36] And goals can be helpful.
[2322.22 → 2327.84] And making them measurable goals gives you something to, ways to judge yourself.
[2327.84 → 2333.90] But in our reading, Paul is not pushing a business plan.
[2334.86 → 2340.22] He wants Christian people to demonstrate Christian character.
[2341.22 → 2343.28] And even impressive numbers.
[2343.44 → 2344.84] You know, attendance up 25%.
[2345.60 → 2346.84] Giving up 30%.
[2347.44 → 2350.42] You know, plans for building expansion underway.
[2350.42 → 2359.72] You know, it only matters if the spirit of Jesus is alive in the place.
[2361.30 → 2362.98] So let's start with this.
[2363.10 → 2369.20] That being blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus, it starts with character.
[2369.50 → 2373.40] When he returns, we should be behaving ourselves.
[2373.74 → 2375.32] And it should show.
[2375.32 → 2384.94] Now, having said all that, there is a word that may give you pause.
[2385.96 → 2388.42] It may make you wonder.
[2389.04 → 2390.20] I mean, it's made me wonder.
[2390.66 → 2392.80] And it's that word blameless.
[2392.94 → 2395.98] May your whole spirit, soul, and body.
[2396.10 → 2399.60] May your whole being is kept blameless.
[2399.60 → 2406.08] Now, at this point, I can hear alarms going off.
[2406.42 → 2407.64] And one of them is personal.
[2408.40 → 2411.40] Because I don't think I can do blameless.
[2412.74 → 2413.78] I mean, I can try.
[2414.84 → 2417.14] I can try really hard.
[2418.52 → 2427.12] But trying for blameless is like climbing some, you know, Christian moral Mount Everest.
[2427.12 → 2433.34] Let's say that I try to be the perfect follower of Christ.
[2434.20 → 2440.88] That I try to be the good Samaritan who stops for every wounded stranger on the road.
[2441.10 → 2444.84] Who tries to be the rich man who gives all that he has to the poor.
[2444.84 → 2450.20] That I try to be also the perfect husband and the perfect father.
[2450.90 → 2459.82] And also be the kind of person who gives his spare time to save the world from toxic politics.
[2460.34 → 2465.10] And from global warming while pursuing truth and reconciliation.
[2466.10 → 2473.44] And if I could manage all of that, then I will be blameless before God.
[2473.44 → 2477.16] I don't think I can do it.
[2478.62 → 2481.78] That's just too high to reach.
[2483.24 → 2485.30] I get tired just thinking about it.
[2487.48 → 2490.62] You know, think of Paul's words to the Romans.
[2491.26 → 2495.94] Where he kind of admits that he chronically fails.
[2495.94 → 2501.14] He says, I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
[2502.54 → 2508.56] I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want, that's what I do.
[2510.02 → 2513.82] Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
[2513.88 → 2516.98] What a wretched man I am.
[2516.98 → 2525.94] Now there's been some discussion over the years about whether Paul was writing about himself before his conversion.
[2526.78 → 2529.76] Before that Damascus Road moment.
[2530.12 → 2531.08] Or after.
[2531.08 → 2537.88] Well, when I look at myself, I would say, well, that's sort of me before Damascus.
[2539.16 → 2541.50] But it's still me after Damascus.
[2541.64 → 2542.70] Maybe a little less.
[2543.54 → 2547.30] But I'm still so far from blameless.
[2548.68 → 2554.20] So how could Paul want the Thessalonians to be kept blameless?
[2554.30 → 2556.20] Isn't that a lot to ask?
[2556.64 → 2559.88] Isn't that, you know, like impossible?
[2559.88 → 2560.00] Is that possible?
[2563.84 → 2580.86] Now here it should help to understand that what Paul is asking, is offering here, is not a commandment with, you know, punishments for failures included.
[2581.50 → 2587.88] He's not offering so much a commandment as something between a prayer and a promise.
[2587.88 → 2595.62] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.
[2595.96 → 2601.60] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus.
[2601.82 → 2603.18] And here is the point.
[2603.66 → 2606.72] Being blameless is not your assignment.
[2607.96 → 2609.56] It's God's work.
[2609.56 → 2612.60] It's God's work to sanctify you.
[2612.80 → 2613.96] And he will do it.
[2614.90 → 2616.54] He'll do it now in part.
[2617.66 → 2621.38] And he will do it fully at the coming of our Lord Jesus.
[2621.38 → 2631.62] You might remember the terms justification and sanctification.
[2632.44 → 2637.72] You know, in the past they were a standard part of every lesson in Christian doctrine.
[2639.46 → 2641.70] Justification was originally a legal term.
[2642.60 → 2643.92] It was used in court.
[2643.92 → 2648.22] And it was basically a declaration that you are not guilty.
[2649.78 → 2653.86] Now in the Bible it becomes God's decision about you.
[2654.54 → 2660.54] He makes the decision, the declaration that you are not guilty.
[2660.66 → 2662.78] That you are blameless.
[2662.78 → 2668.04] Now that's kind of against the facts on the ground.
[2668.70 → 2672.46] Because actually you are guilty and so am I.
[2672.98 → 2675.28] You have failed and so have I.
[2675.92 → 2681.42] We do stand before God as people who deserve to be punished.
[2681.42 → 2689.70] And yet God in his sheer grace declares us not guilty.
[2689.90 → 2690.52] Blameless.
[2691.02 → 2701.04] And he does that because Jesus his son has been perfectly obedient to him all the way to a sacrificial death on a cross.
[2701.56 → 2707.60] And then God gives you and me credit for what his son has done.
[2709.00 → 2710.10] That is his gift.
[2710.10 → 2712.76] By grace you are saved through faith.
[2713.10 → 2715.42] And this is not your own doing.
[2715.72 → 2719.42] It is the gift of God in Christ.
[2719.54 → 2721.84] And so you are justified.
[2724.44 → 2726.88] Well, when it comes to sanctification,
[2728.12 → 2732.78] then think of your character catching up to justification.
[2733.84 → 2736.78] You are officially innocent now.
[2736.78 → 2739.24] You are officially blameless.
[2739.24 → 2741.78] And now you have to act like it.
[2742.90 → 2745.56] Bad habits have to die away.
[2745.86 → 2748.46] And good habits have to be born.
[2749.06 → 2753.32] Your temper might need to cool down a little.
[2753.48 → 2758.46] You might have to learn to be more honest and maybe more humble.
[2759.24 → 2761.96] More compassion for others.
[2762.42 → 2763.90] Especially those less fortunate.
[2763.90 → 2765.90] That would be a perfect thing.
[2766.66 → 2770.06] So sanctification is about such things.
[2770.12 → 2771.86] It's about a new you.
[2773.72 → 2775.10] And here's the thing again.
[2775.56 → 2779.52] Just sanctification is God's gift and God's project.
[2779.66 → 2781.94] He declares you blameless.
[2781.94 → 2787.00] But sanctification is also God's project.
[2787.32 → 2789.58] It's not all up to you.
[2790.54 → 2794.30] This is God's work through the Holy Spirit.
[2796.18 → 2798.28] So our reading reflects that.
[2798.36 → 2798.68] Paul says,
[2798.90 → 2800.46] May God himself,
[2801.42 → 2802.20] the God of peace,
[2802.60 → 2803.74] sanctify you.
[2803.82 → 2806.36] So it's him working on you.
[2806.36 → 2808.56] May your whole spirit,
[2808.78 → 2809.00] soul,
[2809.10 → 2809.60] and body
[2809.60 → 2811.58] be kept blameless.
[2812.02 → 2814.22] So here is a prayer
[2814.22 → 2815.90] and a promise together.
[2816.06 → 2818.36] May God change your character.
[2819.24 → 2820.38] May he make you
[2820.38 → 2821.62] into a new person.
[2821.74 → 2822.40] He is able.
[2822.74 → 2824.24] He is working on you
[2824.24 → 2824.98] right now.
[2825.12 → 2826.74] And when Jesus returns,
[2827.48 → 2829.48] he will finish it.
[2829.48 → 2834.22] Some of you,
[2834.34 → 2835.36] excuse me,
[2835.40 → 2836.46] some of you might remember
[2836.46 → 2839.02] the name Joni Erickson.
[2840.14 → 2841.86] Yes, Joni Erickson.
[2842.38 → 2843.70] Maybe I'm showing my age.
[2844.82 → 2846.34] Joni Erickson was,
[2846.68 → 2847.58] many years ago,
[2847.88 → 2848.98] a young woman,
[2849.36 → 2850.42] very active.
[2851.34 → 2852.86] She loved horses
[2852.86 → 2854.36] and tennis
[2854.36 → 2855.52] and swimming.
[2857.10 → 2858.82] And then at age 17,
[2858.82 → 2860.44] she had a diving accident
[2860.44 → 2862.62] and her neck was broken
[2862.62 → 2863.98] between the fourth
[2863.98 → 2865.00] and fifth vertebrae.
[2865.62 → 2867.36] She became a quadriplegic,
[2867.80 → 2870.22] paralyzed from the shoulders down.
[2871.44 → 2873.00] And she's still paralyzed today.
[2873.14 → 2875.58] She has minimal use of her hands.
[2876.46 → 2878.14] But she had resilience.
[2879.30 → 2881.10] And she became,
[2881.24 → 2882.56] actually she became an artist.
[2882.90 → 2883.70] She does paint
[2883.70 → 2885.88] with a paintbrush in her mouth.
[2886.42 → 2888.06] And she became a writer.
[2888.06 → 2890.88] And she became a speaker
[2890.88 → 2892.34] at conferences,
[2892.52 → 2893.56] at retreats.
[2894.64 → 2896.28] Today she's 75 years old.
[2896.50 → 2897.06] 72.
[2897.42 → 2898.60] 72 years old.
[2899.02 → 2900.84] And she's still an inspiration
[2900.84 → 2902.00] to so many people.
[2902.94 → 2904.12] Especially the disabled.
[2906.30 → 2908.20] Now sometime after that accident,
[2909.04 → 2910.70] she tells in one of her books,
[2910.78 → 2912.18] sometime after that accident,
[2912.18 → 2915.24] she and family and friends
[2915.24 → 2917.46] gathered in some retreat cabin
[2917.46 → 2919.96] for a healing service.
[2921.16 → 2923.72] They anointed Joni with oil.
[2924.72 → 2926.82] And they laid hands on her.
[2927.64 → 2930.14] And they prayed for a miracle.
[2931.14 → 2933.12] They prayed that her ruined
[2933.12 → 2934.68] spinal column
[2934.68 → 2936.18] would be restored
[2936.80 → 2939.08] by the power of God.
[2939.08 → 2942.64] And when that service was over,
[2942.76 → 2944.24] they wheeled her back out
[2944.24 → 2945.52] and off to home.
[2946.40 → 2947.56] And then they waited.
[2948.66 → 2950.32] They waited for the miracle.
[2951.90 → 2953.26] And they waited a day
[2953.26 → 2953.98] and a week
[2953.98 → 2954.98] and a month.
[2956.66 → 2958.30] And it didn't happen.
[2959.70 → 2961.52] Joni is still paralyzed today.
[2961.52 → 2963.68] And she's thought
[2963.68 → 2966.04] long and hard about that.
[2966.16 → 2967.38] About healing.
[2967.70 → 2969.44] And about physical healing.
[2969.64 → 2971.38] And about healing of the spirit.
[2971.62 → 2973.06] And healing of the heart.
[2973.60 → 2975.80] And she said some wise things.
[2976.82 → 2977.64] I was online
[2977.64 → 2979.24] and I chased a few of them
[2979.24 → 2980.12] down last week.
[2981.76 → 2982.30] Joni says,
[2982.56 → 2984.36] one problem I have
[2984.36 → 2985.26] with faith healing
[2985.26 → 2987.90] is that it tends to be focused
[2987.90 → 2989.70] only on the physical side
[2989.70 → 2990.26] of healing.
[2990.26 → 2990.42] healing.
[2991.60 → 2993.48] But Jesus backed away
[2993.48 → 2994.96] when people came to him
[2994.96 → 2997.04] only for their physical needs.
[2997.64 → 2998.22] My goodness,
[2998.32 → 2999.40] he was ready to have you
[2999.40 → 3000.72] lop off your hand.
[3001.90 → 3003.38] His real interest
[3003.38 → 3006.00] was in healing the soul.
[3009.10 → 3009.66] Joni writes,
[3009.78 → 3011.36] I'd rather be in this wheelchair
[3011.36 → 3012.72] knowing God
[3012.72 → 3014.76] than on my feet
[3014.76 → 3015.58] without him.
[3017.30 → 3018.34] And she said,
[3018.78 → 3019.64] here I sit.
[3019.64 → 3022.20] glad that I have not been healed
[3022.20 → 3023.22] on the outside
[3023.22 → 3025.86] but healed on the inside.
[3026.10 → 3027.18] Healed from my own
[3027.18 → 3028.84] self-centred wants
[3028.84 → 3030.08] and wishes.
[3032.02 → 3032.50] You know,
[3032.54 → 3033.24] I kind of wonder
[3033.24 → 3033.92] if she's being a bit
[3033.92 → 3034.94] too hard on herself.
[3035.74 → 3035.94] I mean,
[3035.98 → 3036.74] it's okay
[3036.74 → 3039.50] to want to play tennis again
[3039.50 → 3040.24] or swim
[3040.24 → 3041.88] or ride a horse.
[3042.12 → 3042.90] That's only fair,
[3042.98 → 3043.40] isn't it?
[3043.40 → 3046.12] But she also has a point.
[3046.32 → 3048.46] What we must hope for most
[3048.46 → 3050.90] is a new heart.
[3052.14 → 3053.64] We should hope most
[3053.64 → 3055.30] that we will be transformed
[3055.30 → 3056.64] by the renewal
[3056.64 → 3058.20] of our minds
[3058.20 → 3060.08] so that we will know
[3060.08 → 3060.96] God's will
[3060.96 → 3061.84] and do it.
[3062.84 → 3064.24] And when you think about it,
[3064.40 → 3064.76] that,
[3065.52 → 3066.68] that would be
[3066.68 → 3068.00] an even bigger miracle.
[3068.00 → 3073.30] You know,
[3073.34 → 3073.90] when I read through
[3073.90 → 3074.62] the New Testament,
[3074.84 → 3075.94] I'm caught
[3075.94 → 3077.56] at times
[3077.56 → 3078.42] about how
[3078.42 → 3080.48] those early Christians
[3080.48 → 3081.26] were eager
[3081.26 → 3082.72] for Jesus
[3082.72 → 3083.60] to return.
[3084.54 → 3085.92] There's this longing,
[3086.80 → 3087.92] this impatience.
[3088.40 → 3088.92] Here's Paul
[3088.92 → 3089.64] to the Corinthians.
[3090.02 → 3090.32] He said,
[3090.72 → 3091.50] you do not lack
[3091.50 → 3093.06] any spiritual gift
[3093.06 → 3094.40] as you eagerly
[3094.40 → 3094.82] await
[3094.82 → 3095.72] for the Lord Jesus
[3095.72 → 3096.54] to be revealed.
[3096.54 → 3098.78] He told the Philippians,
[3099.14 → 3099.88] our citizenship
[3099.88 → 3100.84] is in heaven
[3100.84 → 3102.72] and we eagerly
[3102.72 → 3103.80] await a Saviour
[3103.80 → 3104.28] from here,
[3104.72 → 3105.12] from there.
[3105.42 → 3106.28] There's this kind
[3106.28 → 3107.52] of mood about it.
[3107.60 → 3107.78] Like,
[3107.92 → 3108.68] come on,
[3108.78 → 3109.82] let's get on
[3109.82 → 3110.82] with this.
[3114.02 → 3114.58] Now,
[3114.66 → 3115.34] you might not
[3115.34 → 3117.02] feel that eagerness.
[3118.42 → 3119.30] You might
[3119.30 → 3120.48] not
[3120.48 → 3122.76] want it so much.
[3122.84 → 3123.36] You might feel
[3123.36 → 3124.18] kind of caution
[3124.18 → 3124.92] and that would be
[3124.92 → 3125.64] understandable.
[3125.80 → 3126.44] After all,
[3126.54 → 3127.44] you know,
[3127.58 → 3128.38] there's
[3128.38 → 3129.80] so much
[3129.80 → 3130.78] we don't know
[3130.78 → 3131.22] about
[3131.22 → 3132.94] what that will be
[3132.94 → 3134.34] like when it happens.
[3135.00 → 3136.12] What really
[3136.12 → 3137.92] will we see
[3137.92 → 3139.56] when Jesus returns?
[3140.94 → 3141.16] You know,
[3141.22 → 3142.10] I once read
[3142.10 → 3143.26] that the Bible's
[3143.26 → 3143.68] picture
[3143.68 → 3145.20] of the future
[3145.20 → 3146.38] is not
[3146.38 → 3147.24] so much
[3147.24 → 3148.24] like a map
[3148.24 → 3150.84] and an itinerary,
[3150.84 → 3152.78] but it's more
[3152.78 → 3154.80] like signs
[3154.80 → 3156.82] pointing into the mist.
[3158.08 → 3158.94] There's a lot
[3158.94 → 3159.66] we don't know
[3159.66 → 3161.80] and we don't
[3161.80 → 3163.06] have to be afraid
[3163.06 → 3164.06] to say so.
[3164.06 → 3168.06] and yet we can still
[3168.06 → 3169.00] be confident
[3169.00 → 3170.10] and hopeful
[3170.10 → 3171.52] and yes,
[3171.64 → 3172.58] even eager
[3172.58 → 3176.02] because we know
[3176.02 → 3177.54] who waits
[3177.54 → 3178.52] for us
[3178.52 → 3181.48] and we know
[3181.48 → 3183.40] that he waits
[3183.40 → 3183.96] for us
[3183.96 → 3185.26] with infinite love.
[3185.26 → 3185.32] love.
[3187.60 → 3188.76] There was a song
[3188.76 → 3189.52] written years ago,
[3189.60 → 3190.68] I think in the 50s,
[3190.72 → 3191.72] 1950s,
[3192.50 → 3195.38] by Ira Stan fill.
[3195.38 → 3197.78] She said,
[3197.88 → 3198.76] many things
[3198.76 → 3199.66] about tomorrow
[3199.66 → 3201.40] I don't seem
[3201.40 → 3202.42] to understand,
[3203.42 → 3204.80] but I know
[3204.80 → 3205.68] who holds
[3205.68 → 3206.34] the future
[3206.34 → 3207.88] and I know
[3207.88 → 3209.12] who holds
[3209.12 → 3210.04] my hand.
[3211.38 → 3212.38] With that,
[3212.46 → 3213.26] we can face
[3213.26 → 3213.98] the future
[3213.98 → 3215.34] when it comes.
[3215.68 → 3216.26] The one
[3216.26 → 3217.30] who waits
[3217.30 → 3218.02] for us
[3218.02 → 3219.10] is making
[3219.10 → 3220.06] all things
[3220.06 → 3220.44] new,
[3221.98 → 3223.08] including
[3223.08 → 3224.62] our own
[3224.62 → 3225.12] hearts.
[3225.38 → 3227.68] So,
[3227.86 → 3228.48] how should
[3228.48 → 3229.38] we behave
[3229.38 → 3231.58] when Jesus
[3231.58 → 3232.02] comes?
[3232.10 → 3232.50] How will
[3232.50 → 3233.40] we behave
[3233.40 → 3234.10] when Jesus
[3234.10 → 3234.66] comes?
[3235.78 → 3236.12] Well,
[3236.58 → 3237.52] we will be
[3237.52 → 3238.12] blameless.
[3239.60 → 3240.06] Jesus will
[3240.06 → 3240.52] make sure
[3240.52 → 3241.16] about that.
[3242.74 → 3243.52] Let's pray
[3243.52 → 3243.90] together.
[3245.24 → 3246.00] Dear Lord,
[3246.06 → 3246.60] in this Advent
[3246.60 → 3247.10] season,
[3247.24 → 3247.86] we think of
[3247.86 → 3249.20] the coming
[3249.20 → 3250.00] of Jesus,
[3250.60 → 3251.62] long expected,
[3252.76 → 3253.40] long hoped
[3253.40 → 3253.74] for,
[3253.74 → 3255.52] even eagerly
[3255.52 → 3256.14] hoped for.
[3257.10 → 3257.60] And now
[3257.60 → 3257.92] we live
[3257.92 → 3258.24] in this
[3258.24 → 3258.84] time of
[3258.84 → 3259.94] waiting again
[3259.94 → 3261.24] for that
[3261.24 → 3261.70] coming.
[3262.06 → 3262.46] And yes,
[3262.56 → 3263.24] there's so much
[3263.24 → 3264.04] we don't know
[3264.04 → 3264.60] about it,
[3265.04 → 3266.14] but we do
[3266.14 → 3266.64] know that he
[3266.64 → 3267.22] will come
[3267.22 → 3268.62] and that we
[3268.62 → 3269.62] will be changed
[3269.62 → 3270.60] deep within.
[3271.56 → 3272.18] So we pray,
[3272.30 → 3272.70] Lord Jesus,
[3272.86 → 3273.52] begin that
[3273.52 → 3274.44] deep change
[3274.44 → 3275.36] already now
[3275.36 → 3277.12] and make us
[3277.12 → 3277.82] eager for it
[3277.82 → 3278.18] to be
[3278.18 → 3278.76] completely
[3278.76 → 3279.44] finished
[3279.44 → 3280.68] when he
[3280.68 → 3281.04] comes.
[3281.20 → 3281.48] We pray
[3281.48 → 3281.84] this in
[3281.84 → 3282.08] Jesus'
[3282.30 → 3282.58] name.
[3283.08 → 3283.34] Amen.
[3283.34 → 3283.48] Amen.
[3295.00 → 3295.92] Please stand.
[3295.92 → 3305.96] Mummy
[3305.96 → 3307.32] Madeira
[3307.32 → 3309.36] See you,
[3309.52 → 3309.92] I'm
[3309.92 → 3310.16] in
[3310.16 → 3310.36] haste
[3310.36 → 3311.08] nose
[3311.08 → 3311.60] a
[3311.60 → 3311.82] arm
[3311.82 → 3312.82] of Zach
[3312.82 → 3313.20] o
[3313.20 → 3313.52] Heaven
[3313.52 → 3314.18] clean
[3314.18 → 3314.42] name
[3314.42 → 3315.16] How
[3315.16 → 3316.68] are you,
[3316.72 → 3316.86] folks?
[3316.86 → 3317.08] I'm
[3317.08 → 3317.52] in
[3317.52 → 3318.06] time
[3318.06 → 3318.30] and
[3318.30 → 3318.98] guest
[3318.98 → 3321.42] for you,
[3321.54 → 3322.68] O Lord,
[3322.68 → 3326.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3326.68 → 3336.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3336.68 → 3340.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3340.68 → 3344.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3344.68 → 3351.68] O Lord of life, our only hope,
[3351.68 → 3355.68] Your radiant shine, your hope.
[3355.68 → 3359.68] Who look through the dark, Emmanuel, come,
[3359.68 → 3363.68] Come, light our hearts.
[3365.68 → 3372.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3373.68 → 3380.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3380.68 → 3384.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3384.68 → 3389.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3389.68 → 3395.68] Our joy above all other loves.
[3395.68 → 3399.68] In you find more than enough.
[3399.68 → 3402.68] We come as we are.
[3402.68 → 3404.68] O heal and restore.
[3404.68 → 3408.68] Come, light our hearts.
[3408.68 → 3414.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3414.68 → 3424.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3424.68 → 3426.68] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[3426.68 → 3430.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3430.68 → 3434.68] Truly our hope is in you.
[3434.68 → 3435.68] Certified.
[3435.68 → 3436.68] O love outside GLC nah meno yeah.
[3436.68 → 3437.68] Joy.
[3444.68 → 3449.68] People already Pollard.
[3449.68 → 3458.60] Let us come before the Lord our God in congregational prayer.
[3461.60 → 3464.96] Almighty God, we stand among your creation.
[3465.88 → 3468.58] We are struck by the wonder of your craftsmanship.
[3469.50 → 3472.60] The whole earth shakes at the thunder of your voice.
[3473.12 → 3476.48] The violence of the raging waters is made calm at your rebuke.
[3476.48 → 3480.04] Yet even the young sparrows are held in your care.
[3481.04 → 3484.76] You are a God that faithfully attends to the suffering of the least.
[3485.70 → 3488.00] We come as a broken, wayward people.
[3488.74 → 3494.26] You come as a shepherd, a healer, a counsellor full of love, mercy and grace.
[3494.78 → 3498.16] An ever-present God who hears and delights in our prayers.
[3498.94 → 3501.66] So we come before you this morning with Thanksgiving.
[3502.72 → 3505.30] We thank you for a safe and peaceful country to live in.
[3505.30 → 3511.96] We are blessed with a stable government that by all accounts works for the betterment and the safety of their people.
[3512.60 → 3514.38] We worship you openly this morning.
[3514.94 → 3519.02] Never for a moment needing to worry about a bomb going off halfway through the service.
[3519.86 → 3523.48] These are luxuries we who are born in the West often forget.
[3524.00 → 3530.42] But for many people in this congregation, it is a luxury that can never be forgotten and never taken for granted.
[3530.42 → 3534.10] Thank you for this congregation of believers here this morning.
[3534.72 → 3538.38] Compassionate, thoughtful people that look to do good in the world.
[3539.12 → 3543.24] And more importantly, are proud to do so in your name and your name alone.
[3544.52 → 3548.14] Thankful for the beautiful, seemingly boundless wilderness that surrounds our city.
[3549.02 → 3552.50] Even while the storms rage around us, you are near.
[3552.50 → 3560.22] And yet, we are also a burdened and a weary people, weighed down by the sin and suffering in this world.
[3561.22 → 3567.16] So we pray for the people devastated by the floods on the Sums Prairie, in Merritt and in Princeton.
[3568.20 → 3573.50] In a few hours' time, livelihoods were destroyed, homes were filled with water, and hope disappeared.
[3573.50 → 3579.22] And all this is coming after a summer of drought and sometimes unbearable heat.
[3580.18 → 3582.68] We pray too for the sick and the shut-in.
[3583.18 → 3586.48] For those suffering the endless battle against lifelong illnesses.
[3587.32 → 3589.40] We think this morning of Jason and his family.
[3589.80 → 3591.68] We are glad they are recovering and well.
[3591.90 → 3594.70] And we look forward to having them back again soon.
[3595.26 → 3600.14] But Lord, there are people in this congregation whom a speedy recovery seems out of reach.
[3600.14 → 3615.24] So we pray for Pat and Doug and Joan and Cor and Joyce and Carl and Grace and Mark and Hank and Jerry and Anne and Shirley and Diane and Jeanette and John and Henry.
[3615.94 → 3617.28] It's a long list, Lord.
[3618.00 → 3620.36] We pray for a day when it is empty.
[3621.06 → 3627.20] But until then, we boldly ask for nothing less than full and complete healing.
[3627.20 → 3630.18] Because their suffering is great, Lord.
[3630.66 → 3632.58] And we feel utterly helpless.
[3633.56 → 3636.86] We ask you, Lord, once again to share in and take in our burdens.
[3637.52 → 3640.12] We are tired, Lord, and in need of rest.
[3640.80 → 3644.44] So for those struggling against daily pain and chronic health issues.
[3644.64 → 3648.50] For those suffering with mental illness, desperation, and loneliness.
[3649.20 → 3652.52] For those among us feeling the daily effects of old age.
[3652.52 → 3653.64] We pray.
[3654.44 → 3655.76] Come, Lord Jesus.
[3656.32 → 3657.24] Come quickly.
[3657.96 → 3659.10] Heal our broken world.
[3659.76 → 3668.34] Deliver us from floods and wars and pandemics and famines and sickness as you did for the Israelites thousands of years ago.
[3670.02 → 3674.48] But if not, we still give you thanks.
[3675.04 → 3676.14] We still praise you.
[3676.40 → 3679.08] We still rejoice daily in your holy name.
[3679.56 → 3681.34] A name above all names.
[3681.34 → 3686.66] For we are redeemed through the precious blood of Jesus.
[3687.44 → 3689.82] May your kingdom come and your will be done.
[3690.34 → 3691.84] In Jesus' powerful name.
[3692.44 → 3692.64] Amen.
[3706.64 → 3707.40] Please stand.
[3707.40 → 3714.06] Go now in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[3714.90 → 3721.94] May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[3722.12 → 3723.94] And God's people say, Amen.
[3723.94 → 3733.24] God bless everyone.
[3733.24 → 3735.84] Amen.
[3739.56 → 3752.10] Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
[3752.10 → 3762.90] Take my moments and my days, let them flow in endless praise.
[3762.90 → 3768.68] Let them flow in endless praise.
[3769.44 → 3780.24] Take my will and make it thine, it shall be no longer mine.
[3780.24 → 3790.90] Take my heart, it is thy heart, it shall be thy royal throne.
[3791.30 → 3796.14] It shall be thy royal throne.
[3798.24 → 3808.16] Take my love, my Lord, I pour, and thy feet is treasured's storm.
[3808.16 → 3818.94] Take myself and I will be ever holy, all for thee.
[3819.16 → 3824.72] Ever holy, all for thee.
[3824.72 → 3826.72] Amen.
[3826.72 → 3827.72] Amen.
[3827.72 → 3829.72] Amen.
[3829.72 → 3831.72] Amen.
[3831.72 → 3833.72] Amen.
[3833.72 → 3835.72] Amen.

[3841.72 → 3843.00] Amen.
[3844.72 → 3845.90] Amen.
[3846.72 → 3848.72] Amen.
[3848.72 → 3849.02] Amen.
[3849.02 → 3849.30] Amen.
[3849.72 → 3852.34] Amen.
[3853.72 → 3854.58] Amen.
[3854.72 → 3855.14] Amen.
[3855.14 → 3855.84] Amen.
[3855.84 → 3856.16] Amen.
[3856.18 → 3856.72] Amen.
[3856.72 → 3857.00] Amen.
[3857.00 → 3857.20] Amen.
[3857.44 → 3857.98] Amen.
[3857.98 → 3858.56] Amen.
[3858.56 → 3859.48] Amen.
[3859.48 → 3859.62] Amen.
[3859.62 → 3859.88] Amen.
[3859.88 → 3860.60] Amen.
[3861.62 → 3861.98] Amen.
[3861.98 → 3862.04] Amen.
[3862.04 → 3862.74] Amen.
[3862.74 → 3863.52] Amen.
[3864.12 → 3864.24] Amen.
