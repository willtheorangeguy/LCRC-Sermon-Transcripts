[792.54 → 799.16] how great is our God
[799.16 → 809.10] come on up
[812.34 → 818.10] okay so we have another baptism on this
[818.10 → 821.20] Sunday still in the season of Easter
[821.20 → 823.38] where we are celebrating the new life
[823.38 → 824.66] that we have in Christ each week
[824.66 → 827.06] and so you didn't
[827.06 → 828.22] you weren't able to
[828.22 → 831.08] meet them
[831.08 → 832.54] because we didn't need to do a video
[832.54 → 834.06] Edgar and Suzanne
[834.06 → 837.88] were part of the Living Waters Church
[837.88 → 839.84] and when they left
[839.84 → 842.80] they decided they wanted to become a part of our congregation
[842.80 → 844.66] and so they were already baptized there
[844.66 → 846.02] they've transferred their membership
[846.02 → 848.48] to us at Lanner CRC
[848.48 → 853.42] and so today we are baptizing this little one
[853.42 → 854.98] and her name is Sienna
[854.98 → 856.68] oh sorry Sylvia
[856.68 → 857.70] Sylvia
[857.70 → 861.98] so let me give this introduction
[861.98 → 865.56] the Holy Scriptures say in the Book of Genesis
[865.56 → 867.42] I will establish my covenant
[867.42 → 869.32] between me and you
[869.32 → 871.50] and your offspring after you
[871.50 → 872.84] throughout their generations
[872.84 → 874.94] for an everlasting covenant
[874.94 → 876.84] to be God to you
[876.84 → 878.70] and to your offspring after you
[878.70 → 881.56] and so we see throughout the scriptures
[881.56 → 883.50] that from the beginning
[883.50 → 885.66] God has graciously included
[885.66 → 887.76] our children in his covenant
[887.76 → 890.76] and all of his promises come to us
[890.76 → 892.60] but also to our children as well
[892.60 → 895.48] and so we are to teach our children
[895.48 → 898.06] that they have been set apart
[898.06 → 899.34] in baptism
[899.34 → 901.08] as belonging to God
[901.08 → 903.76] so that as they grow older
[903.76 → 906.68] they may then respond to him
[906.68 → 908.56] in personal faith
[908.56 → 909.22] and commitment
[909.22 → 911.34] so Edgar and Suzanne
[911.34 → 914.72] having heard God's gracious promises
[914.72 → 916.32] to you through the gospel
[916.32 → 917.96] do you desire today
[917.96 → 919.82] to have your child Sylvia be baptized?
[919.82 → 920.88] yes well
[920.88 → 921.52] okay
[921.52 → 923.88] and so Sylvia
[923.88 → 926.72] hi
[926.72 → 928.36] you look very cute
[928.36 → 929.22] I like this
[929.22 → 931.42] so Sylvia
[931.42 → 933.44] it is for you
[933.44 → 934.56] that Jesus Christ
[934.56 → 935.68] came into this world
[935.68 → 937.02] it is for you
[937.02 → 937.80] that he lived
[937.80 → 938.82] it is for you
[938.82 → 939.94] that he suffered and died
[939.94 → 940.70] it is for you
[940.70 → 942.40] that he rose again from the dead
[942.40 → 943.66] and ascended into heaven
[943.66 → 944.82] it is for you
[944.82 → 945.60] that he promised
[945.60 → 947.32] that he will return
[947.32 → 949.60] and he did this
[949.60 → 950.58] for you
[950.58 → 951.62] even though
[951.62 → 952.98] you know nothing of it yet
[952.98 → 954.08] and truly
[954.08 → 954.86] we love
[954.86 → 955.60] because God
[955.60 → 957.48] first loved us
[957.48 → 960.56] ready
[960.56 → 961.90] this is the water
[961.90 → 962.52] ready
[962.52 → 963.66] Sylvia
[963.66 → 964.54] I baptize you
[964.54 → 965.56] in the name of the Father
[965.56 → 968.04] and of the Son
[968.04 → 970.58] and of the Holy Spirit
[970.58 → 972.14] Amen
[972.14 → 978.04] and Sylvia
[978.04 → 979.08] even though
[979.08 → 980.30] your friends
[980.30 → 981.06] and your parents
[981.06 → 981.74] and your grandparents
[981.74 → 983.08] will call you Sylvia
[983.08 → 984.54] your
[984.54 → 986.26] deep name
[986.26 → 987.14] your true name
[987.14 → 988.40] is Christian
[988.40 → 993.56] and so let me bless you now
[993.56 → 996.56] may the Lord bless you
[996.56 → 997.26] and keep you
[997.26 → 998.48] may the Lord
[998.48 → 999.10] make his face
[999.10 → 999.92] to shine upon you
[999.92 → 1000.96] and be gracious to you
[1000.96 → 1002.16] and may the Lord
[1002.16 → 1003.06] turn his face
[1003.06 → 1003.64] toward you
[1003.64 → 1004.56] and give you
[1004.56 → 1005.48] his peace
[1005.48 → 1007.52] so let's pray together
[1007.52 → 1009.40] our Heavenly Father
[1009.40 → 1009.94] we pray
[1009.94 → 1010.90] for your blessing

[1026.06 → 1026.80] to your promises

[1266.00 → 1267.04] and glory
[1267.04 → 1268.18] forever and ever
[1268.18 → 1268.92] Amen
[1268.92 → 1270.78] now let us sing
[1270.78 → 1271.68] of that assurance
[1271.68 → 1283.64] before the throne
[1283.64 → 1286.00] of God above
[1286.00 → 1303.22] I am a strong and perfect
[1303.22 → 1306.32] a great high priest
[1306.32 → 1308.58] whose name is love
[1308.58 → 1311.32] whoever lives and pleads
[1311.32 → 1312.96] for me
[1312.96 → 1315.28] my name is written
[1315.28 → 1315.34] my name is written
[1315.34 → 1317.62] on his hands
[1317.62 → 1319.66] my name is written
[1319.66 → 1321.94] on his heart
[1321.94 → 1325.10] I know that while in heaven
[1325.10 → 1326.38] he stands
[1326.38 → 1328.44] no tongue can bid me
[1328.44 → 1329.96] friends depart
[1329.96 → 1332.96] no tongue can bid me
[1332.96 → 1334.52] friends depart
[1334.52 → 1343.84] when Satan tempts me
[1343.84 → 1344.84] to despair
[1344.84 → 1349.28] and tells me of the guilt
[1349.28 → 1350.50] within
[1350.50 → 1352.52] a heart I look
[1352.52 → 1354.90] and see him there
[1354.90 → 1356.78] who made an end
[1356.78 → 1359.48] of all my sin
[1359.48 → 1362.16] because the sinless
[1362.16 → 1363.90] the Saviour died
[1363.90 → 1365.96] my sinful soul
[1365.96 → 1368.34] is counted free
[1368.34 → 1370.56] for God the justice
[1370.56 → 1372.84] satisfied
[1372.84 → 1374.72] to look on him
[1374.72 → 1377.42] and pardon me
[1377.42 → 1379.36] to look on him
[1379.36 → 1382.16] and pardon me
[1382.16 → 1390.94] behold him there
[1390.94 → 1393.34] the risen land
[1393.34 → 1397.06] my perfect spotless righteousness
[1397.06 → 1402.38] the great unchangeable I am
[1402.38 → 1404.48] the King of glory
[1404.48 → 1407.08] and of grace
[1407.08 → 1409.00] and with himself
[1409.00 → 1411.00] I cannot die
[1411.00 → 1413.66] my soul is purchased
[1413.66 → 1416.00] by his blood
[1416.00 → 1418.08] my life is hid
[1418.08 → 1420.44] with Christ on high
[1420.44 → 1422.58] with Christ my Saviour
[1422.58 → 1425.28] and my God
[1425.28 → 1427.38] with Christ my Saviour
[1427.38 → 1430.46] and my God
[1430.46 → 1431.80] God
[1431.80 → 1444.12] good morning everyone
[1444.12 → 1448.30] today we are going to continue
[1448.30 → 1450.54] in our sermon series
[1450.54 → 1451.74] during the season of Easter
[1451.74 → 1453.52] it's a series entitled
[1453.52 → 1454.42] You Are
[1454.42 → 1456.24] and so in this series
[1456.24 → 1457.24] we're looking at a few
[1457.24 → 1457.92] of the titles
[1457.92 → 1459.50] that we find in the Bible
[1459.50 → 1460.92] that describe
[1460.92 → 1462.02] who we are
[1462.02 → 1463.78] and who we are becoming
[1463.78 → 1465.66] when we put our faith
[1465.66 → 1466.88] in the risen Christ
[1466.88 → 1468.26] and follow him
[1468.26 → 1470.44] the first title
[1470.44 → 1471.14] we considered
[1471.14 → 1472.46] was that of being
[1472.46 → 1473.20] a disciple
[1473.20 → 1475.34] and we said that
[1475.34 → 1476.38] a disciple is one
[1476.38 → 1476.98] who has heard
[1476.98 → 1477.88] the call of Jesus
[1477.88 → 1479.30] and then who responds
[1479.30 → 1481.08] to that call
[1481.08 → 1482.88] by taking up our crosses
[1482.88 → 1484.02] and denying ourselves
[1484.02 → 1485.08] and following Jesus
[1485.08 → 1486.22] in simple obedience
[1486.22 → 1488.10] then last week
[1488.10 → 1488.98] we looked at the title
[1488.98 → 1489.72] of being a witness
[1489.72 → 1490.98] and we said that
[1490.98 → 1491.50] being a witness
[1491.50 → 1492.64] is not so much
[1492.64 → 1495.16] trying to defend
[1495.16 → 1496.44] the gospel
[1496.44 → 1498.06] or arguing for the faith
[1498.06 → 1498.66] like a lawyer
[1498.66 → 1499.30] but simply
[1499.30 → 1500.82] giving an answer
[1500.82 → 1502.08] as we pray
[1502.08 → 1503.04] for opportunities
[1503.04 → 1504.30] to share
[1504.30 → 1505.50] our own experience
[1505.50 → 1506.38] of God's grace
[1506.38 → 1508.72] and so this week
[1508.72 → 1509.70] what I want to consider
[1509.70 → 1511.12] is the title
[1511.12 → 1513.06] of a servant
[1513.06 → 1513.98] okay the title
[1513.98 → 1514.50] of a servant
[1514.50 → 1515.64] and so today
[1515.64 → 1516.24] we're going to be looking
[1516.24 → 1517.80] at John 13
[1517.80 → 1519.56] and this is a very
[1519.56 → 1520.70] well known passage
[1520.70 → 1521.70] this is where Jesus
[1521.70 → 1523.38] washes his disciples feet
[1523.38 → 1526.06] and it is very moving
[1526.06 → 1527.30] it's very emotional
[1527.30 → 1529.00] because this is
[1529.00 → 1530.46] Jesus' last night
[1530.46 → 1531.36] on earth
[1531.36 → 1532.74] before he goes
[1532.74 → 1533.58] to die on the cross
[1533.58 → 1535.24] and so he is spending
[1535.24 → 1536.16] it with his disciples
[1536.16 → 1537.82] and he wants
[1537.82 → 1539.68] to teach his disciples
[1539.68 → 1540.34] something
[1540.34 → 1543.08] of immense importance
[1543.08 → 1544.86] before he leaves them
[1544.86 → 1546.88] and what's striking here
[1546.88 → 1548.08] is that he doesn't do it
[1548.08 → 1549.02] by talking
[1549.02 → 1550.58] but first
[1550.58 → 1552.38] by showing them
[1552.38 → 1553.30] an example
[1553.30 → 1555.48] by demonstrating it
[1555.48 → 1557.14] and so let's read
[1557.14 → 1558.06] the passage together
[1558.06 → 1558.70] we'll be looking
[1558.70 → 1559.32] again at
[1559.32 → 1560.80] John chapter 13
[1560.80 → 1562.40] and we will be reading
[1562.40 → 1564.14] verses 1 through 17
[1564.14 → 1566.18] and I will read it for us
[1566.18 → 1568.60] it was just before
[1568.60 → 1569.70] the Passover festival
[1569.70 → 1571.02] Jesus knew
[1571.02 → 1571.58] that the hour
[1571.58 → 1572.52] had come for him
[1572.52 → 1573.44] to leave this world
[1573.44 → 1574.56] and go to the father
[1574.56 → 1576.34] having loved his own
[1576.34 → 1577.24] who were in the world
[1577.24 → 1577.88] he loved them
[1577.88 → 1578.54] to the end
[1578.54 → 1580.56] the evening meal
[1580.56 → 1581.52] was in progress
[1581.52 → 1582.76] and the devil
[1582.76 → 1583.50] had already
[1583.50 → 1584.34] prompted Judas
[1584.34 → 1585.28] the son of Simon
[1585.28 → 1585.92] Iscariot
[1585.92 → 1587.76] to betray Jesus
[1587.76 → 1590.20] Jesus knew
[1590.20 → 1590.80] that the father
[1590.80 → 1591.84] had put all things
[1591.84 → 1592.94] under his power
[1592.94 → 1594.32] and that he had
[1594.32 → 1595.34] come from God
[1595.34 → 1596.00] and was returning
[1596.00 → 1596.66] to God
[1596.66 → 1598.32] so he got up
[1598.32 → 1598.88] from the meal
[1598.88 → 1600.88] took off his outer clothing
[1600.88 → 1602.18] and wrapped a towel
[1602.18 → 1603.02] around his waist
[1603.02 → 1604.34] after that
[1604.34 → 1605.12] he poured water
[1605.12 → 1605.90] into a basin
[1605.90 → 1606.92] and began to wash
[1606.92 → 1608.32] his disciples feet
[1608.32 → 1609.64] drying them
[1609.64 → 1610.50] with a towel
[1610.50 → 1611.42] that was wrapped
[1611.42 → 1612.12] around him
[1612.12 → 1615.06] he came to Simon Peter
[1615.06 → 1616.46] who said to him
[1616.46 → 1617.38] Lord are you going
[1617.38 → 1618.36] to wash my feet
[1618.36 → 1620.04] Jesus replied
[1620.04 → 1620.90] you do not realize
[1620.90 → 1622.02] now what I am doing
[1622.02 → 1622.90] but later you will
[1622.90 → 1623.42] understand
[1623.42 → 1624.64] no
[1624.64 → 1625.84] said Peter
[1625.84 → 1626.84] you shall never
[1626.84 → 1627.68] wash my feet
[1627.68 → 1629.40] Jesus answered
[1629.40 → 1630.52] unless I wash you
[1630.52 → 1631.90] you have no part
[1631.90 → 1632.52] with me
[1632.52 → 1634.70] then Lord
[1634.70 → 1635.94] Simon Peter replied
[1635.94 → 1637.32] not just my feet
[1637.32 → 1638.24] but my hands
[1638.24 → 1639.18] and my head
[1639.18 → 1639.86] as well
[1639.86 → 1641.64] Jesus answered
[1641.64 → 1642.40] those who have
[1642.40 → 1643.04] had a bath
[1643.04 → 1643.94] need only to wash
[1643.94 → 1644.44] their feet
[1644.44 → 1645.82] their whole body
[1645.82 → 1646.36] is clean
[1646.36 → 1647.50] and you are clean
[1647.50 → 1648.34] though not every one
[1648.34 → 1648.66] of you
[1648.66 → 1649.92] for he knew
[1649.92 → 1650.46] who was going
[1650.46 → 1651.10] to betray him
[1651.10 → 1652.24] and that was why
[1652.24 → 1652.68] he said
[1652.68 → 1653.60] not every one
[1653.60 → 1654.32] was clean
[1654.32 → 1656.90] when he had finished
[1656.90 → 1657.84] washing their feet
[1657.84 → 1658.94] he put on his clothes
[1658.94 → 1660.14] and returned to his place
[1660.14 → 1661.66] do you understand
[1661.66 → 1662.40] what I have done
[1662.40 → 1662.82] for you
[1662.82 → 1663.70] he asked them
[1663.70 → 1664.78] you call me
[1664.78 → 1665.78] teacher and Lord
[1665.78 → 1667.04] and rightly so
[1667.04 → 1668.10] for that is what I am
[1668.10 → 1669.52] now that I
[1669.52 → 1670.46] your Lord and teacher
[1670.46 → 1671.62] have washed your feet
[1671.62 → 1672.80] you also
[1672.80 → 1674.00] should wash
[1674.00 → 1675.14] one another's feet
[1675.14 → 1677.14] I have set you
[1677.14 → 1677.70] an example
[1677.70 → 1678.70] that you should do
[1678.70 → 1679.56] as I have done
[1679.56 → 1680.08] for you
[1680.08 → 1681.78] very truly I tell you
[1681.78 → 1682.76] no servant is greater
[1682.76 → 1683.52] than his master
[1683.52 → 1684.96] nor is a messenger
[1684.96 → 1685.82] greater than the one
[1685.82 → 1686.48] who sent him
[1686.48 → 1687.86] now that you know
[1687.86 → 1688.58] these things
[1688.58 → 1690.12] you will be blessed
[1690.12 → 1691.20] if you do them
[1691.20 → 1693.74] friends this is the word
[1693.74 → 1694.16] of the Lord
[1694.16 → 1695.74] let's pray together
[1695.74 → 1698.94] Father we come before you
[1698.94 → 1700.12] we come before
[1700.12 → 1701.32] this
[1701.32 → 1703.18] this scene
[1703.18 → 1703.82] this picture
[1703.82 → 1704.88] that you have given us
[1704.88 → 1707.02] and Lord we ask
[1707.02 → 1707.80] that you would
[1707.80 → 1710.22] just as Jesus asked
[1710.22 → 1710.90] you understand
[1710.90 → 1711.42] what I have done
[1711.42 → 1711.76] for you
[1711.76 → 1712.42] Lord would you help
[1712.42 → 1713.54] us to understand
[1713.54 → 1715.46] what you have done
[1715.46 → 1715.98] for us
[1715.98 → 1717.32] and what it would
[1717.32 → 1718.10] mean for us
[1718.10 → 1718.98] to do likewise
[1718.98 → 1721.06] we pray in Jesus name
[1721.06 → 1721.62] Amen
[1721.62 → 1725.00] so a few years ago
[1725.00 → 1726.14] my family and I
[1726.14 → 1727.00] went camping
[1727.00 → 1728.12] at Golden Ears
[1728.12 → 1728.84] Provincial Park
[1728.84 → 1729.48] and we were with
[1729.48 → 1730.22] some other families
[1730.22 → 1731.68] and we were particularly
[1731.68 → 1732.92] excited that day
[1732.92 → 1733.96] not only because
[1733.96 → 1734.84] of the beautiful
[1734.84 → 1735.32] surroundings
[1735.32 → 1736.98] and that we could
[1736.98 → 1737.72] go swimming in the
[1737.72 → 1738.48] lake and for the
[1738.48 → 1739.48] campfire that was
[1739.48 → 1740.86] to come later
[1740.86 → 1741.62] that night
[1741.62 → 1743.38] but because we were
[1743.38 → 1744.08] going to have the
[1744.08 → 1745.02] chance to see a
[1745.02 → 1746.94] total solar eclipse
[1746.94 → 1748.08] do you remember that
[1748.08 → 1748.70] happened a couple
[1748.70 → 1749.20] years ago
[1749.20 → 1750.60] so on this particular
[1750.60 → 1751.10] day
[1751.10 → 1752.66] everyone was making
[1752.66 → 1753.70] sure to have
[1753.70 → 1754.34] these special
[1754.34 → 1754.84] glasses
[1754.84 → 1756.60] because if you
[1756.60 → 1757.30] really wanted to
[1757.30 → 1758.12] take in the full
[1758.12 → 1759.24] glory the full
[1759.24 → 1759.86] uniqueness
[1759.86 → 1761.18] of what was going
[1761.18 → 1762.10] to happen that day
[1762.10 → 1764.10] to really gaze
[1764.10 → 1764.56] at it
[1764.56 → 1765.38] and to watch
[1765.38 → 1766.00] it and look
[1766.00 → 1766.40] at it
[1766.40 → 1767.46] you had to put
[1767.46 → 1768.08] these glasses
[1768.08 → 1768.90] on in order
[1768.90 → 1769.62] to see it
[1769.62 → 1770.54] right
[1770.54 → 1771.14] they gave you
[1771.14 → 1771.72] the ability
[1771.72 → 1772.66] to actually
[1772.66 → 1773.64] look directly
[1773.64 → 1774.54] at the eclipse
[1774.54 → 1775.06] and to see it
[1775.06 → 1775.70] so clearly
[1775.70 → 1777.44] to focus on it
[1777.44 → 1779.62] and for those
[1779.62 → 1780.96] who did
[1780.96 → 1782.12] it was a
[1782.12 → 1783.00] remarkable
[1783.00 → 1784.70] experience
[1784.70 → 1785.42] a remarkable
[1785.42 → 1785.96] glimpse
[1785.96 → 1786.46] of something
[1786.46 → 1787.06] that was
[1787.06 → 1788.40] absolutely amazing
[1788.40 → 1789.08] something that
[1789.08 → 1789.74] you would otherwise
[1789.74 → 1790.98] not be able
[1790.98 → 1791.48] to see
[1791.48 → 1792.86] but if you
[1792.86 → 1793.46] didn't have
[1793.46 → 1794.28] the glasses
[1794.28 → 1795.14] it was easy
[1795.14 → 1795.86] to actually
[1795.86 → 1796.42] just miss
[1796.42 → 1796.90] the entire
[1796.90 → 1797.28] thing
[1797.28 → 1799.26] or at least
[1799.26 → 1799.70] you wouldn't
[1799.70 → 1800.20] be able
[1800.20 → 1800.84] to take it
[1800.84 → 1801.34] in
[1801.34 → 1802.20] and see
[1802.20 → 1802.60] what is
[1802.60 → 1803.02] happening
[1803.02 → 1804.28] to the depth
[1804.28 → 1805.28] that you could
[1805.28 → 1805.84] if you had
[1805.84 → 1806.24] the glasses
[1806.24 → 1806.56] on
[1806.56 → 1807.96] and in the
[1807.96 → 1808.46] same way
[1808.46 → 1809.46] John 13
[1809.46 → 1811.36] there's a
[1811.36 → 1811.96] kind of
[1811.96 → 1813.18] same dynamic
[1813.18 → 1814.10] that is happening
[1814.10 → 1815.12] it's as though
[1815.12 → 1816.12] John is giving
[1816.12 → 1817.82] each one of us
[1817.82 → 1818.78] this pair of
[1818.78 → 1819.14] glasses
[1819.14 → 1819.84] and he's saying
[1819.84 → 1820.44] do you want
[1820.44 → 1821.00] to see
[1821.00 → 1822.28] true glory
[1822.28 → 1823.50] do you want
[1823.50 → 1824.04] to see
[1824.04 → 1825.44] power
[1825.44 → 1827.24] redefined
[1827.24 → 1828.26] and reimagined
[1828.26 → 1828.96] do you want
[1828.96 → 1829.32] to see what
[1829.32 → 1830.08] real love
[1830.08 → 1830.78] looks like
[1830.78 → 1832.24] and he says
[1832.24 → 1833.12] well I want
[1833.12 → 1833.98] you to look
[1833.98 → 1834.92] through these
[1834.92 → 1835.80] right
[1835.80 → 1836.20] I want you
[1836.20 → 1836.80] to see
[1836.80 → 1838.00] as you put
[1838.00 → 1838.56] these glasses
[1838.56 → 1839.16] on something
[1839.16 → 1840.20] absolutely amazing
[1840.20 → 1841.14] and that is
[1841.14 → 1842.30] Jesus washing
[1842.30 → 1843.38] the disciples
[1843.38 → 1843.70] feet
[1843.70 → 1845.42] and it was
[1845.42 → 1846.24] such a powerful
[1846.24 → 1847.18] way for Jesus
[1847.18 → 1848.62] to impress
[1848.62 → 1849.76] upon his followers
[1849.76 → 1850.52] this message
[1850.52 → 1851.58] that he wanted
[1851.58 → 1853.50] to go deep
[1853.50 → 1854.72] into their hearts
[1854.72 → 1856.24] and the message
[1856.24 → 1856.84] is
[1856.84 → 1858.20] I want you
[1858.20 → 1858.70] to become
[1858.70 → 1859.40] foot washers
[1859.40 → 1859.66] too
[1859.66 → 1861.20] I want you
[1861.20 → 1861.84] to become
[1861.84 → 1862.70] people of the
[1862.70 → 1863.14] towel
[1863.14 → 1864.08] right
[1864.08 → 1864.72] I want you
[1864.72 → 1865.20] to love
[1865.20 → 1865.76] and serve
[1865.76 → 1866.42] others
[1866.42 → 1867.36] just as
[1867.36 → 1868.24] I am loving
[1868.24 → 1868.68] and serving
[1868.68 → 1869.00] you
[1869.00 → 1869.82] that's what
[1869.82 → 1870.26] it means
[1870.26 → 1870.82] to be my
[1870.82 → 1871.26] disciple
[1871.26 → 1871.80] it means
[1871.80 → 1872.36] to be
[1872.36 → 1873.30] a servant
[1873.30 → 1875.16] and so
[1875.16 → 1875.74] today I want
[1875.74 → 1876.08] to look at
[1876.08 → 1876.60] three things
[1876.60 → 1877.14] in our passage
[1877.14 → 1877.60] about being
[1877.60 → 1878.00] a servant
[1878.00 → 1879.08] first the
[1879.08 → 1879.76] picture of
[1879.76 → 1880.28] being a servant
[1880.28 → 1880.78] that we're
[1880.78 → 1881.26] given here
[1881.26 → 1882.74] then the
[1882.74 → 1883.46] problem with
[1883.46 → 1883.98] being a servant
[1883.98 → 1884.50] why it's so
[1884.50 → 1885.44] hard for us
[1885.44 → 1887.18] then lastly
[1887.18 → 1888.20] the path
[1888.20 → 1888.78] to being a servant
[1888.78 → 1889.52] how can we
[1889.52 → 1890.74] actually do this
[1890.74 → 1892.74] so first the
[1892.74 → 1893.22] picture of being
[1893.22 → 1893.62] a servant
[1893.62 → 1894.48] you know as
[1894.48 → 1895.64] we often say
[1895.64 → 1896.36] a picture is
[1896.36 → 1897.36] worth a thousand
[1897.36 → 1897.86] words
[1897.86 → 1898.92] and so
[1898.92 → 1900.12] here we're
[1900.12 → 1900.58] basically
[1900.58 → 1901.76] given a
[1901.76 → 1902.40] picture
[1902.40 → 1903.98] that sums
[1903.98 → 1904.52] up the
[1904.52 → 1905.18] entirety
[1905.18 → 1906.10] of Jesus's
[1906.10 → 1906.58] ministry
[1906.58 → 1908.02] really the
[1908.02 → 1909.14] entire character
[1909.14 → 1909.72] of the kingdom
[1909.72 → 1910.30] of God
[1910.30 → 1911.06] and the very
[1911.06 → 1912.48] heart of God
[1912.48 → 1914.00] so let's
[1914.00 → 1914.66] consider this
[1914.66 → 1915.26] picture that
[1915.26 → 1915.84] John is
[1915.84 → 1916.54] showing us
[1916.54 → 1917.70] so Jesus
[1917.70 → 1918.02] and his
[1918.02 → 1918.60] followers are
[1918.60 → 1919.26] gathered together
[1919.26 → 1919.72] in the upper
[1919.72 → 1920.02] room
[1920.02 → 1920.38] it's kind of
[1920.38 → 1920.64] like this
[1920.64 → 1921.34] dining room
[1921.34 → 1922.10] where they
[1922.10 → 1922.76] were sharing
[1922.76 → 1923.78] the last meal
[1923.78 → 1924.70] the last supper
[1924.70 → 1926.54] and right in
[1926.54 → 1926.86] the middle
[1926.86 → 1927.66] of the meal
[1927.66 → 1928.68] Jesus does
[1928.68 → 1929.10] something
[1929.10 → 1930.02] absolutely
[1930.02 → 1930.86] unimaginable
[1930.86 → 1931.30] they would
[1931.30 → 1931.88] never have
[1931.88 → 1932.34] thought that
[1932.34 → 1932.84] Jesus would
[1932.84 → 1933.12] do
[1933.12 → 1933.54] this
[1933.54 → 1934.64] he gets
[1934.64 → 1934.98] up
[1934.98 → 1935.50] and he
[1935.50 → 1935.94] washes
[1935.94 → 1936.44] the feet
[1936.44 → 1937.00] of each
[1937.00 → 1937.44] one
[1937.44 → 1938.02] of his
[1938.02 → 1938.56] followers
[1938.56 → 1938.96] sitting
[1938.96 → 1939.22] around
[1939.22 → 1939.68] the table
[1939.68 → 1940.88] and it
[1940.88 → 1941.62] is shocking
[1941.62 → 1942.86] and it
[1942.86 → 1943.96] is scandalous
[1943.96 → 1945.18] on multiple
[1945.18 → 1945.72] levels
[1945.72 → 1947.42] first culturally
[1947.42 → 1948.68] in Jesus's
[1948.68 → 1949.26] day everyone
[1949.26 → 1949.92] travelled around
[1949.92 → 1950.38] by foot
[1950.38 → 1950.94] and everyone
[1950.94 → 1951.84] wore sandals
[1951.84 → 1952.24] that was the
[1952.24 → 1952.58] fashion
[1952.58 → 1953.98] so when you
[1953.98 → 1954.96] walked around
[1954.96 → 1956.34] all the time
[1956.34 → 1956.72] what would
[1956.72 → 1957.12] happen to
[1957.12 → 1957.58] your feet
[1957.58 → 1959.02] they got
[1959.02 → 1959.70] filthy
[1959.70 → 1962.04] but they
[1962.04 → 1962.90] didn't have
[1962.90 → 1963.64] clean
[1963.64 → 1964.34] kind of
[1964.34 → 1964.96] sanitary
[1964.96 → 1965.96] streets
[1965.96 → 1966.80] like we
[1966.80 → 1967.32] do today
[1967.32 → 1968.06] so not only
[1968.06 → 1968.56] did you get
[1968.56 → 1969.18] dirt on your
[1969.18 → 1969.40] feet
[1969.40 → 1969.78] but guess
[1969.78 → 1970.08] what
[1970.08 → 1971.12] you also
[1971.12 → 1971.70] got human
[1971.70 → 1972.18] excrement
[1972.18 → 1973.24] which was
[1973.24 → 1974.08] thrown out
[1974.08 → 1974.58] of the
[1974.58 → 1974.90] houses
[1974.90 → 1976.14] onto the
[1976.14 → 1976.58] streets
[1976.58 → 1978.10] and animal
[1978.10 → 1978.54] waste
[1978.54 → 1979.04] which was
[1979.04 → 1979.46] left on
[1979.46 → 1979.78] the country
[1979.78 → 1980.08] roads
[1980.08 → 1980.46] and left
[1980.46 → 1981.00] on the
[1981.00 → 1981.76] town streets
[1981.76 → 1982.46] and so
[1982.46 → 1982.84] that's why
[1982.84 → 1983.42] washing your
[1983.42 → 1983.76] feet was
[1983.76 → 1984.40] absolutely
[1984.40 → 1985.10] necessary
[1985.10 → 1986.06] when you
[1986.06 → 1986.42] come into
[1986.42 → 1986.80] a house
[1986.80 → 1987.08] if you
[1987.08 → 1987.30] want to
[1987.30 → 1987.74] come home
[1987.74 → 1987.94] or you
[1987.94 → 1988.20] want to
[1988.20 → 1988.82] be in
[1988.82 → 1989.82] civilized
[1989.82 → 1990.28] company
[1990.28 → 1991.14] you needed
[1991.14 → 1991.66] to wash
[1991.66 → 1992.14] your feet
[1992.14 → 1993.04] and of course
[1993.04 → 1993.50] normally you
[1993.50 → 1993.82] would wash
[1993.82 → 1994.22] your own
[1994.22 → 1994.58] feet
[1994.58 → 1996.48] but
[1996.48 → 1997.88] if you
[1997.88 → 1998.60] were having
[1998.60 → 1999.26] guests
[1999.26 → 2000.14] for dinner
[2000.14 → 2000.84] the task
[2000.84 → 2001.28] of doing
[2001.28 → 2001.82] this as an
[2001.82 → 2002.20] act of
[2002.20 → 2002.62] hospitality
[2002.62 → 2003.34] to your
[2003.34 → 2003.92] guests
[2003.92 → 2005.20] would have
[2005.20 → 2005.56] course
[2005.56 → 2006.28] normally be
[2006.28 → 2006.90] assigned
[2006.90 → 2008.00] to slaves
[2008.00 → 2009.56] or servants
[2009.56 → 2010.34] of the
[2010.34 → 2011.22] the lowest status
[2011.22 → 2012.22] right
[2012.22 → 2012.90] so much
[2012.90 → 2013.72] so that
[2013.72 → 2014.52] foot washing
[2014.52 → 2015.22] was actually
[2015.22 → 2015.62] virtually
[2015.62 → 2016.30] synonymous
[2016.30 → 2018.08] with slavery
[2018.08 → 2019.64] and what
[2019.64 → 2020.26] makes this
[2020.26 → 2020.94] account
[2020.94 → 2022.80] so extraordinary
[2022.80 → 2023.50] is that there
[2023.50 → 2023.90] is actually
[2023.90 → 2024.84] no parallel
[2024.84 → 2026.06] in any
[2026.06 → 2026.98] other ancient
[2026.98 → 2027.46] literature
[2027.46 → 2028.46] of any
[2028.46 → 2029.06] person
[2029.06 → 2030.12] of superior
[2030.12 → 2031.10] status
[2031.10 → 2032.82] voluntarily
[2032.82 → 2034.76] washing the
[2034.76 → 2035.68] feet of
[2035.68 → 2036.22] those with
[2036.22 → 2037.42] inferior status
[2037.42 → 2038.96] and this
[2038.96 → 2039.82] is not just
[2039.82 → 2040.46] you know
[2040.46 → 2041.08] an honoured
[2041.08 → 2041.78] teacher
[2041.78 → 2042.94] performing
[2042.94 → 2043.50] a shameful
[2043.50 → 2044.18] task
[2044.18 → 2045.04] this is
[2045.04 → 2045.98] the divine
[2045.98 → 2046.46] sovereign
[2046.46 → 2046.82] god
[2046.82 → 2047.04] of the
[2047.04 → 2047.42] entire
[2047.42 → 2048.00] universe
[2048.00 → 2049.54] who is
[2049.54 → 2050.18] humbling
[2050.18 → 2050.88] himself
[2050.88 → 2052.42] to such
[2052.42 → 2053.24] a distance
[2053.24 → 2054.62] taking
[2054.62 → 2055.68] the role
[2055.68 → 2056.60] of a
[2056.60 → 2056.94] servant
[2056.94 → 2057.48] at a
[2057.48 → 2057.78] table
[2057.78 → 2060.40] this is
[2060.40 → 2060.94] why the
[2060.94 → 2061.40] disciples
[2061.40 → 2062.40] are so
[2062.40 → 2063.40] shocked
[2063.40 → 2064.76] and so
[2064.76 → 2066.20] scandalized
[2066.20 → 2067.08] so I want
[2067.08 → 2067.52] to show you
[2067.52 → 2068.10] this painting
[2068.10 → 2068.76] by Ford
[2068.76 → 2069.16] Maddox
[2069.16 → 2069.52] Brown
[2069.52 → 2070.82] he was
[2070.82 → 2071.14] an English
[2071.14 → 2071.54] painter
[2071.54 → 2072.34] of the
[2072.34 → 2072.68] romantic
[2072.68 → 2073.12] period
[2073.12 → 2073.60] in the
[2073.60 → 2073.92] mid
[2073.92 → 2075.18] 1800s
[2075.18 → 2076.74] so take
[2076.74 → 2076.94] a look
[2076.94 → 2077.16] at this
[2077.16 → 2077.48] picture
[2077.48 → 2080.80] in particular
[2080.80 → 2081.96] excuse me
[2081.96 → 2082.58] in particular
[2082.58 → 2083.88] notice the
[2083.88 → 2085.16] facial expressions
[2085.16 → 2085.60] of the
[2085.60 → 2086.02] disciples
[2086.02 → 2087.30] and so
[2087.30 → 2087.92] the figure
[2087.92 → 2088.36] on the
[2088.36 → 2088.82] right
[2088.82 → 2089.56] is said
[2089.56 → 2089.92] to be
[2089.92 → 2090.34] John
[2090.34 → 2092.08] and you
[2092.08 → 2092.16] know
[2092.16 → 2092.82] he's just
[2092.82 → 2093.64] taking it
[2093.64 → 2094.12] all in
[2094.12 → 2094.54] he's kind
[2094.54 → 2095.28] of observing
[2095.28 → 2096.30] thinking about
[2096.30 → 2096.56] it
[2096.56 → 2098.00] but then
[2098.00 → 2098.32] when you
[2098.32 → 2098.70] look at
[2098.70 → 2099.06] the other
[2099.06 → 2099.58] disciples
[2099.58 → 2100.08] around the
[2100.08 → 2100.38] back of
[2100.38 → 2100.78] the table
[2100.78 → 2101.28] you see
[2101.28 → 2101.72] that there's
[2101.72 → 2102.44] this sense
[2102.44 → 2103.86] of utter
[2103.86 → 2105.08] dismay
[2105.08 → 2106.68] imagine
[2106.68 → 2107.22] it probably
[2107.22 → 2107.98] took 20
[2107.98 → 2108.38] or 30
[2108.38 → 2108.70] minutes
[2108.70 → 2109.26] for Jesus
[2109.26 → 2109.72] to wash
[2109.72 → 2110.18] all of
[2110.18 → 2110.64] the disciples
[2110.64 → 2110.98] feet
[2110.98 → 2111.60] and so
[2111.60 → 2111.98] they're just
[2111.98 → 2112.70] sitting there
[2112.70 → 2113.80] in this
[2113.80 → 2114.50] awkward
[2114.50 → 2115.50] horrified
[2115.50 → 2116.30] silence
[2116.30 → 2116.76] wondering
[2116.76 → 2117.56] what on
[2117.56 → 2118.22] earth
[2118.22 → 2119.04] is he
[2119.04 → 2119.40] doing
[2119.40 → 2120.82] like why
[2120.82 → 2121.38] is he
[2121.38 → 2122.52] humiliating
[2122.52 → 2122.90] himself
[2122.90 → 2123.72] like that
[2123.72 → 2124.46] right
[2124.46 → 2124.92] this guy
[2124.92 → 2125.30] with his
[2125.30 → 2125.68] hands
[2125.68 → 2126.14] on his
[2126.14 → 2126.60] head
[2126.60 → 2127.16] they're
[2127.16 → 2127.52] looking
[2127.52 → 2127.96] at it
[2127.96 → 2128.22] kind
[2128.22 → 2128.42] of
[2128.42 → 2129.44] glancing
[2129.44 → 2129.96] sideways
[2129.96 → 2130.28] they don't
[2130.28 → 2130.64] even want
[2130.64 → 2131.00] to look
[2131.00 → 2131.32] directly
[2131.32 → 2131.78] at it
[2131.78 → 2132.06] and you
[2132.06 → 2132.32] see the
[2132.32 → 2132.42] guy
[2132.42 → 2132.64] on the
[2132.64 → 2132.98] left
[2132.98 → 2133.74] people say
[2133.74 → 2134.16] it's probably
[2134.16 → 2134.58] Judas
[2134.58 → 2135.04] he's like
[2135.04 → 2135.66] I'm just
[2135.66 → 2135.76] going to
[2135.76 → 2136.00] take off
[2136.00 → 2136.46] my sandals
[2136.46 → 2136.80] so Jesus
[2136.80 → 2137.16] can wash
[2137.16 → 2137.50] my feet
[2137.50 → 2138.00] no problem
[2138.00 → 2139.08] and there's
[2139.08 → 2139.36] his money
[2139.36 → 2139.70] bag on
[2139.70 → 2140.10] the table
[2140.10 → 2142.06] but the
[2142.06 → 2142.40] centre
[2142.40 → 2142.72] of the
[2142.72 → 2143.18] painting
[2143.18 → 2144.24] John
[2144.24 → 2144.50] would you
[2144.50 → 2144.90] grab my
[2144.90 → 2145.62] coffee mug
[2145.62 → 2146.08] for me
[2146.08 → 2146.70] thanks
[2146.70 → 2147.92] the centre
[2147.92 → 2148.24] of the
[2148.24 → 2148.56] painting
[2148.56 → 2149.42] is Jesus
[2149.42 → 2150.30] washing
[2150.30 → 2151.10] Peter's
[2151.10 → 2151.30] feet
[2151.30 → 2152.24] and I
[2152.24 → 2152.54] love
[2152.54 → 2153.02] Peter's
[2153.02 → 2153.44] expression
[2153.44 → 2154.02] he looks
[2154.02 → 2155.62] so upset
[2155.62 → 2156.50] and grumpy
[2156.50 → 2157.00] about the
[2157.00 → 2157.54] situation
[2157.54 → 2158.22] you know
[2158.22 → 2158.60] it's like
[2158.60 → 2159.06] he's saying
[2159.06 → 2159.32] Lord
[2159.32 → 2159.78] this is
[2159.78 → 2160.32] completely
[2160.32 → 2160.76] beneath
[2160.76 → 2161.06] you
[2161.06 → 2162.86] because
[2162.86 → 2163.26] what
[2163.26 → 2163.54] Jesus
[2163.54 → 2164.12] is doing
[2164.12 → 2164.44] is
[2164.44 → 2165.10] culturally
[2165.10 → 2166.20] scandalous
[2166.20 → 2170.84] the
[2170.84 → 2171.14] the
[2171.14 → 2171.62] second
[2171.62 → 2171.94] thing
[2171.94 → 2172.36] is
[2172.36 → 2173.98] this
[2173.98 → 2174.54] is
[2174.54 → 2175.00] also
[2175.00 → 2175.96] theologically
[2175.96 → 2177.26] revolutionary
[2177.26 → 2178.96] Jesus
[2178.96 → 2179.72] in many
[2179.72 → 2180.32] ways
[2180.32 → 2180.68] is
[2180.68 → 2181.94] redefining
[2181.94 → 2182.86] or at
[2182.86 → 2183.02] least
[2183.02 → 2183.22] he's
[2183.22 → 2184.18] helping
[2184.18 → 2184.38] us
[2184.38 → 2184.70] to see
[2184.70 → 2185.00] very
[2185.00 → 2185.56] clearly
[2185.56 → 2186.82] what
[2186.82 → 2187.38] love
[2187.38 → 2188.14] is
[2188.14 → 2188.98] like
[2188.98 → 2189.40] what
[2189.40 → 2189.96] greatness
[2189.96 → 2190.36] is
[2190.36 → 2190.58] what
[2190.58 → 2191.30] power
[2191.30 → 2192.02] is
[2192.02 → 2192.44] actually
[2192.44 → 2193.06] intended
[2193.06 → 2194.26] to be
[2194.26 → 2194.54] used
[2194.54 → 2194.80] for
[2194.80 → 2195.94] and
[2195.94 → 2196.16] he's
[2196.16 → 2196.38] doing
[2196.38 → 2196.52] it
[2196.52 → 2196.64] to
[2196.64 → 2196.94] reveal
[2196.94 → 2197.16] to
[2197.16 → 2197.46] us
[2197.46 → 2197.94] who
[2197.94 → 2198.34] God
[2198.34 → 2198.64] really
[2198.64 → 2199.14] is
[2199.14 → 2200.12] Jesus
[2200.12 → 2200.34] is
[2200.34 → 2200.50] doing
[2200.50 → 2200.74] this
[2200.74 → 2201.10] is
[2201.10 → 2201.50] giving
[2201.50 → 2201.68] us
[2201.68 → 2201.84] a
[2201.84 → 2202.20] picture
[2202.20 → 2203.04] of
[2203.04 → 2203.48] who
[2203.48 → 2204.12] God
[2204.12 → 2204.66] is
[2204.66 → 2205.42] it's
[2205.42 → 2205.58] like
[2205.58 → 2205.78] he's
[2205.78 → 2206.04] saying
[2206.04 → 2206.60] you know
[2206.60 → 2207.02] I don't
[2207.02 → 2207.26] know
[2207.26 → 2207.42] what
[2207.42 → 2207.54] you
[2207.54 → 2208.06] imagine
[2208.06 → 2208.46] God
[2208.46 → 2208.66] to
[2208.66 → 2208.90] be
[2208.90 → 2209.30] like
[2209.30 → 2210.06] but
[2210.06 → 2210.30] I
[2210.30 → 2210.48] am
[2210.48 → 2210.68] going
[2210.68 → 2210.88] to
[2210.88 → 2211.16] show
[2211.16 → 2211.50] you
[2211.50 → 2212.26] and
[2212.26 → 2212.44] so
[2212.44 → 2212.88] Jesus
[2212.88 → 2213.30] Christ
[2213.30 → 2213.50] who
[2213.50 → 2213.66] is
[2213.66 → 2214.02] God
[2214.02 → 2214.20] in
[2214.20 → 2214.36] the
[2214.36 → 2214.76] flesh
[2214.76 → 2215.32] he
[2215.32 → 2215.90] comes
[2215.90 → 2216.36] to
[2216.36 → 2216.82] you
[2216.82 → 2217.58] as
[2217.58 → 2217.92] a
[2217.92 → 2218.30] servant
[2218.30 → 2219.34] by
[2219.34 → 2219.78] leaving
[2219.78 → 2220.00] the
[2220.00 → 2220.36] table
[2220.36 → 2220.54] of
[2220.54 → 2221.06] feasting
[2221.06 → 2222.06] leaving
[2222.06 → 2222.48] the
[2222.48 → 2223.12] seat
[2223.12 → 2223.28] of
[2223.28 → 2223.66] honour
[2223.66 → 2223.92] at
[2223.92 → 2224.06] the
[2224.06 → 2224.42] table
[2224.42 → 2226.52] humiliating
[2226.52 → 2226.98] himself
[2226.98 → 2227.20] by
[2227.20 → 2227.50] taking
[2227.50 → 2227.88] off
[2227.88 → 2228.06] his
[2228.06 → 2228.36] outer
[2228.36 → 2228.92] garments
[2228.92 → 2229.38] which
[2229.38 → 2229.82] culturally
[2229.82 → 2230.34] was
[2230.34 → 2230.84] shameful
[2230.84 → 2232.04] taking
[2232.04 → 2232.26] the
[2232.26 → 2232.60] place
[2232.60 → 2232.78] of
[2232.78 → 2232.98] the
[2232.98 → 2233.44] lowest
[2233.44 → 2234.30] servant
[2234.30 → 2235.54] stooping
[2235.54 → 2235.84] down
[2235.84 → 2236.06] and
[2236.06 → 2236.54] intimately
[2236.54 → 2237.16] washing
[2237.16 → 2237.44] the
[2237.44 → 2237.78] filth
[2237.78 → 2237.98] off
[2237.98 → 2238.12] of
[2238.12 → 2238.36] each
[2238.36 → 2238.50] of
[2238.50 → 2238.64] his
[2238.64 → 2238.94] friend's
[2238.94 → 2239.14] feet
[2239.14 → 2240.34] so
[2240.34 → 2240.48] do
[2240.48 → 2240.60] you
[2240.60 → 2240.78] want
[2240.78 → 2240.90] to
[2240.90 → 2241.12] know
[2241.12 → 2241.28] what
[2241.28 → 2241.52] God
[2241.52 → 2241.68] is
[2241.68 → 2242.12] like
[2242.12 → 2243.64] the
[2243.64 → 2244.20] one
[2244.20 → 2244.94] who
[2244.94 → 2245.38] poured
[2245.38 → 2246.04] waters
[2246.04 → 2246.46] into
[2246.46 → 2246.74] the
[2246.74 → 2247.34] oceans
[2247.34 → 2247.54] and
[2247.54 → 2247.78] filled
[2247.78 → 2247.98] them
[2247.98 → 2248.36] up
[2248.36 → 2249.38] poured
[2249.38 → 2249.78] water
[2249.78 → 2250.04] into
[2250.04 → 2250.28] a
[2250.28 → 2250.52] bowl
[2250.52 → 2250.88] and
[2250.88 → 2251.00] the
[2251.00 → 2251.32] one
[2251.32 → 2251.80] who
[2251.80 → 2252.30] sits
[2252.30 → 2253.26] enthroned
[2253.26 → 2253.50] in
[2253.50 → 2253.90] glory
[2253.90 → 2254.26] over
[2254.26 → 2254.64] all
[2254.64 → 2255.12] things
[2255.12 → 2255.64] got
[2255.64 → 2256.04] down
[2256.04 → 2256.34] on
[2256.34 → 2256.60] his
[2256.60 → 2257.04] knees
[2257.04 → 2257.70] and
[2257.70 → 2258.02] washed
[2258.02 → 2258.34] feet
[2258.34 → 2259.18] right
[2259.18 → 2259.50] that
[2259.50 → 2259.72] is
[2259.72 → 2259.92] who
[2259.92 → 2260.20] God
[2260.20 → 2260.60] is
[2260.60 → 2262.52] but
[2262.52 → 2262.64] in
[2262.64 → 2262.86] showing
[2262.86 → 2263.04] us
[2263.04 → 2263.18] this
[2263.18 → 2263.48] picture
[2263.48 → 2263.64] it's
[2263.64 → 2263.84] not
[2263.84 → 2264.14] only
[2264.14 → 2264.58] about
[2264.58 → 2265.08] Jesus
[2265.08 → 2265.48] washing
[2265.48 → 2265.76] feet
[2265.76 → 2265.98] all
[2265.98 → 2266.10] of
[2266.10 → 2266.22] this
[2266.22 → 2266.38] is
[2266.38 → 2266.70] pointing
[2266.70 → 2267.38] beyond
[2267.38 → 2267.86] itself
[2267.86 → 2268.46] all
[2268.46 → 2268.60] of
[2268.60 → 2268.86] it's
[2268.86 → 2269.00] like
[2269.00 → 2269.28] a
[2269.28 → 2269.66] lived
[2269.66 → 2270.30] parable
[2270.30 → 2271.04] to
[2271.04 → 2271.24] what
[2271.24 → 2271.56] Jesus
[2271.56 → 2271.84] has
[2271.84 → 2272.10] come
[2272.10 → 2272.26] to

[2406.68 → 2407.76] is
[2407.76 → 2408.18] beautiful
[2408.18 → 2408.60] like
[2408.60 → 2408.76] we
[2408.76 → 2409.06] love
[2409.06 → 2409.22] to
[2409.22 → 2409.36] hear
[2409.36 → 2409.76] stories
[2409.76 → 2409.96] about
[2409.96 → 2410.22] people
[2410.22 → 2410.64] serving
[2410.64 → 2411.78] you
[2411.78 → 2411.94] know
[2411.94 → 2412.58] we
[2412.58 → 2412.86] think
[2412.86 → 2413.06] it's
[2413.06 → 2413.56] great
[2413.56 → 2413.96] when
[2413.96 → 2414.28] we
[2414.28 → 2414.96] see
[2414.96 → 2415.60] someone
[2415.60 → 2416.18] serving
[2416.18 → 2416.92] sacrificially
[2416.92 → 2417.86] but
[2417.86 → 2418.16] then
[2418.16 → 2418.36] you
[2418.36 → 2418.78] give
[2418.78 → 2419.22] someone
[2419.22 → 2419.42] an
[2419.42 → 2420.08] actual
[2420.08 → 2420.68] needy
[2420.68 → 2421.14] person
[2421.14 → 2421.94] who
[2421.94 → 2422.20] wants
[2422.20 → 2422.32] you
[2422.32 → 2422.46] to
[2422.46 → 2422.68] do
[2422.68 → 2422.98] things
[2422.98 → 2423.16] for
[2423.16 → 2423.50] them
[2423.50 → 2424.48] even
[2424.48 → 2424.90] when
[2424.90 → 2425.32] you're
[2425.32 → 2425.60] tired
[2425.60 → 2425.78] and
[2425.78 → 2426.04] busy
[2426.04 → 2427.52] and
[2427.52 → 2427.80] they
[2427.80 → 2428.24] might
[2428.24 → 2428.86] not
[2428.86 → 2429.10] even
[2429.10 → 2429.30] say
[2429.30 → 2429.58] thank
[2429.58 → 2429.80] you
[2429.80 → 2430.88] then
[2430.88 → 2431.02] we're
[2431.02 → 2431.38] like
[2431.38 → 2432.34] no
[2432.34 → 2432.62] thank
[2432.62 → 2432.90] you
[2432.90 → 2433.42] right
[2433.42 → 2433.96] I'll
[2433.96 → 2434.36] pass
[2434.36 → 2434.50] I
[2434.50 → 2434.64] don't
[2434.64 → 2434.78] want
[2434.78 → 2434.98] any
[2434.98 → 2435.22] part
[2435.22 → 2435.32] of
[2435.32 → 2435.52] that
[2435.52 → 2436.74] and
[2436.74 → 2436.84] so
[2436.84 → 2437.16] why
[2437.16 → 2437.34] is
[2437.34 → 2437.58] serving
[2437.58 → 2437.78] so
[2437.78 → 2438.18] difficult
[2438.18 → 2439.04] why
[2439.04 → 2439.68] is
[2439.68 → 2439.78] it
[2439.78 → 2439.96] such
[2439.96 → 2440.08] a
[2440.08 → 2440.38] struggle
[2440.38 → 2440.62] and
[2440.62 → 2440.78] you
[2440.78 → 2440.86] know
[2440.86 → 2441.00] I
[2441.00 → 2441.20] think
[2441.20 → 2441.34] if
[2441.34 → 2441.54] we
[2441.54 → 2442.00] talked
[2442.00 → 2442.26] about
[2442.26 → 2442.38] it
[2442.38 → 2442.52] we
[2442.52 → 2442.74] could
[2442.74 → 2443.26] name
[2443.26 → 2443.96] so
[2443.96 → 2444.28] many
[2444.28 → 2444.64] different
[2444.64 → 2445.08] reasons
[2445.08 → 2445.58] why
[2445.58 → 2446.02] serving
[2446.02 → 2446.24] is
[2446.24 → 2446.48] so
[2446.48 → 2446.98] hard
[2446.98 → 2448.14] but
[2448.14 → 2448.48] one
[2448.48 → 2448.66] in
[2448.66 → 2449.14] particular
[2449.14 → 2449.94] comes
[2449.94 → 2450.28] to
[2450.28 → 2450.58] mind
[2450.58 → 2451.64] and
[2451.64 → 2451.90] that
[2451.90 → 2452.14] is
[2452.14 → 2452.32] a
[2452.32 → 2452.58] deep
[2452.58 → 2453.06] down
[2455.78 → 2456.14] rewarded
[2456.14 → 2456.58] when
[2456.58 → 2456.76] we
[2456.76 → 2457.10] serve
[2457.10 → 2457.92] right
[2457.92 → 2458.06] we
[2458.06 → 2458.22] want
[2458.22 → 2458.46] people
[2458.46 → 2458.62] to
[2458.62 → 2458.80] take
[2458.80 → 2459.24] notice
[2459.24 → 2460.12] you
[2460.12 → 2460.18] know
[2460.18 → 2460.32] we
[2460.32 → 2460.58] want
[2460.58 → 2460.78] to
[2460.78 → 2461.18] get
[2461.18 → 2461.66] something
[2461.66 → 2462.02] out
[2462.02 → 2462.14] of
[2462.14 → 2462.24] it
[2462.24 → 2462.38] in
[2462.38 → 2462.68] some
[2462.68 → 2462.96] way
[2462.96 → 2463.14] so
[2463.14 → 2463.28] that
[2463.28 → 2463.40] we
[2463.40 → 2463.54] can
[2463.54 → 2463.78] feel
[2463.78 → 2463.98] that
[2463.98 → 2464.20] it
[2464.20 → 2464.40] is
[2464.40 → 2465.00] not
[2465.00 → 2465.20] just
[2465.20 → 2465.44] us
[2465.44 → 2465.88] pouring
[2465.88 → 2466.36] out
[2466.36 → 2466.58] and
[2466.58 → 2466.88] serving
[2466.88 → 2467.10] but
[2467.10 → 2467.26] that
[2467.26 → 2467.40] we
[2467.40 → 2467.50] are
[2467.50 → 2467.70] kind
[2467.70 → 2467.80] of
[2467.80 → 2468.02] getting
[2468.02 → 2468.18] at
[2468.18 → 2468.32] least
[2468.32 → 2468.86] some
[2468.86 → 2469.60] benefit
[2469.60 → 2470.32] from
[2470.32 → 2470.56] it
[2470.56 → 2471.88] you
[2471.88 → 2471.98] know
[2471.98 → 2472.10] and
[2472.10 → 2472.20] so
[2472.20 → 2472.36] we
[2472.36 → 2472.78] have
[2472.78 → 2472.98] this
[2472.98 → 2473.34] fear
[2473.34 → 2474.08] of
[2474.08 → 2474.86] obscurity
[2474.86 → 2475.92] right
[2475.92 → 2476.18] and
[2476.18 → 2476.68] that
[2476.68 → 2477.28] no
[2477.28 → 2477.40] one
[2477.40 → 2477.54] will
[2477.54 → 2477.84] notice
[2477.84 → 2478.02] no
[2478.02 → 2478.14] one
[2478.14 → 2478.32] will
[2478.32 → 2478.70] know
[2478.70 → 2478.94] what
[2478.94 → 2479.06] we
[2479.06 → 2479.12] are
[2479.12 → 2479.54] doing
[2479.54 → 2480.28] and
[2480.28 → 2480.42] it
[2480.42 → 2480.48] is
[2480.48 → 2480.90] rooted
[2480.90 → 2481.16] in
[2481.16 → 2481.34] this
[2481.34 → 2481.76] fear
[2481.76 → 2482.04] of
[2482.04 → 2482.28] not
[2482.28 → 2482.46] being
[2482.46 → 2482.98] recognized
[2482.98 → 2483.16] and
[2483.16 → 2483.36] not
[2483.36 → 2483.64] being
[2483.64 → 2484.32] rewarded
[2484.32 → 2485.82] behind
[2485.82 → 2486.16] so
[2486.16 → 2486.42] much
[2486.42 → 2486.58] of
[2486.58 → 2486.74] what
[2486.74 → 2486.90] we
[2486.90 → 2487.14] do
[2487.14 → 2487.30] is
[2487.30 → 2487.42] the
[2487.42 → 2487.92] desire
[2487.92 → 2488.14] to
[2488.14 → 2488.34] get
[2488.34 → 2488.72] something
[2488.72 → 2489.08] for
[2489.08 → 2489.22] it
[2489.22 → 2489.44] from
[2489.44 → 2489.90] ourselves
[2489.90 → 2490.34] whether
[2490.34 → 2490.68] we
[2490.68 → 2491.18] just
[2491.18 → 2491.92] post
[2491.92 → 2492.06] it
[2492.06 → 2492.16] on
[2492.16 → 2492.44] social
[2492.44 → 2492.84] media
[2492.84 → 2493.76] let
[2493.76 → 2494.38] people
[2494.38 → 2494.56] know
[2494.56 → 2494.70] what
[2494.70 → 2494.86] we're
[2494.86 → 2495.00] up
[2495.00 → 2495.22] to
[2495.22 → 2496.32] or
[2496.32 → 2496.60] whether
[2496.60 → 2496.82] we
[2496.82 → 2496.94] can
[2496.94 → 2497.08] put
[2497.08 → 2497.16] it
[2497.16 → 2497.26] on
[2497.26 → 2497.42] our
[2497.42 → 2497.78] resume
[2497.78 → 2498.44] or
[2498.44 → 2498.76] whether
[2498.76 → 2499.00] we
[2499.00 → 2499.30] get
[2499.30 → 2499.52] a
[2499.52 → 2499.78] pat
[2499.78 → 2499.92] on
[2499.92 → 2500.02] the
[2500.02 → 2500.36] back
[2500.36 → 2502.28] so
[2502.28 → 2502.66] Charles
[2502.66 → 2503.04] Spurgeon
[2503.04 → 2503.36] was
[2508.70 → 2509.14] struggle
[2509.14 → 2509.70] that
[2509.70 → 2509.84] we
[2509.84 → 2510.26] have
[2510.26 → 2510.82] with
[2510.82 → 2511.20] serving
[2511.20 → 2512.26] it's
[2512.26 → 2512.38] a
[2512.38 → 2512.60] story
[2512.60 → 2512.72] of
[2512.72 → 2512.84] a
[2512.84 → 2513.16] king
[2513.16 → 2514.10] a
[2514.10 → 2514.42] farmer
[2514.42 → 2514.64] and
[2514.64 → 2514.78] a
[2514.78 → 2515.18] nobleman
[2515.18 → 2515.90] and
[2515.90 → 2515.98] it
[2515.98 → 2516.12] goes
[2516.12 → 2516.28] like
[2516.28 → 2516.62] this
[2516.62 → 2517.46] once
[2517.46 → 2517.70] upon
[2517.70 → 2517.86] a
[2517.86 → 2518.08] time
[2518.08 → 2518.22] there
[2518.22 → 2518.34] was
[2518.34 → 2518.48] a
[2518.48 → 2518.76] king
[2518.76 → 2518.96] who
[2518.96 → 2519.32] ruled
[2519.32 → 2519.62] over
[2519.62 → 2520.10] everything
[2520.10 → 2520.32] in
[2520.32 → 2520.42] the
[2520.42 → 2520.76] land
[2520.76 → 2522.00] one
[2522.00 → 2522.34] day
[2522.34 → 2522.76] there
[2522.76 → 2522.84] was
[2522.84 → 2522.98] a
[2522.98 → 2523.50] gardener
[2523.50 → 2524.48] in
[2524.48 → 2524.64] his
[2524.64 → 2524.96] kingdom
[2524.96 → 2525.36] and
[2525.36 → 2525.76] he
[2525.76 → 2526.24] grew
[2526.24 → 2526.90] an
[2526.90 → 2527.70] enormous
[2527.70 → 2528.32] carrot
[2528.32 → 2529.48] and
[2529.48 → 2529.64] he
[2529.64 → 2529.94] took
[2529.94 → 2530.06] it
[2530.06 → 2530.16] to
[2530.16 → 2530.34] the
[2530.34 → 2530.64] king
[2530.64 → 2531.02] because
[2531.02 → 2531.20] he
[2531.20 → 2531.34] was
[2531.34 → 2531.58] so
[2531.58 → 2532.06] proud
[2532.06 → 2532.24] of
[2532.24 → 2532.42] it
[2532.42 → 2533.08] it
[2533.08 → 2533.20] was
[2533.20 → 2533.36] the
[2533.36 → 2533.56] best
[2533.56 → 2533.74] thing
[2533.74 → 2533.88] he
[2533.88 → 2534.02] had
[2534.02 → 2534.34] ever
[2534.34 → 2534.82] grown
[2534.82 → 2535.04] and
[2535.04 → 2535.14] he
[2535.14 → 2535.34] said
[2535.34 → 2535.56] my
[2535.56 → 2535.88] lord
[2535.88 → 2536.16] this
[2536.16 → 2536.30] is
[2536.30 → 2536.48] the
[2536.48 → 2536.84] greatest
[2536.84 → 2537.22] carrot
[2537.22 → 2537.42] I
[2537.42 → 2537.56] have
[2537.56 → 2537.82] ever
[2537.82 → 2538.18] grown
[2538.18 → 2538.80] and
[2538.80 → 2539.12] ever
[2539.12 → 2539.44] will
[2539.44 → 2539.80] grow
[2539.80 → 2540.72] and
[2540.72 → 2541.04] therefore
[2541.04 → 2541.38] I
[2541.38 → 2541.58] want
[2541.58 → 2541.72] to
[2541.72 → 2542.08] present
[2542.08 → 2542.28] it
[2542.28 → 2542.62] to
[2542.62 → 2542.82] you
[2542.82 → 2543.00] as
[2543.00 → 2543.16] a
[2543.16 → 2543.52] token
[2543.52 → 2544.14] of
[2544.14 → 2544.34] my
[2544.34 → 2544.88] love
[2544.88 → 2545.40] for
[2545.40 → 2545.72] you
[2545.72 → 2546.36] and
[2546.36 → 2546.52] the
[2546.52 → 2546.76] king
[2546.76 → 2547.02] was
[2547.02 → 2547.54] touched
[2547.54 → 2548.50] and
[2548.50 → 2548.68] he
[2548.68 → 2549.52] discerned
[2549.52 → 2549.64] the
[2549.64 → 2550.02] man's
[2550.02 → 2550.42] heart
[2550.42 → 2551.18] and
[2551.18 → 2551.32] so
[2551.32 → 2552.46] as
[2552.46 → 2552.60] the

[2568.18 → 2568.34] the
[2568.34 → 2568.82] gardener
[2568.82 → 2569.04] was
[2569.04 → 2569.44] just
[2569.44 → 2570.38] amazed
[2570.38 → 2570.60] and
[2570.60 → 2571.18] delighted

[2571.46 → 2572.28] overjoyed

[2573.04 → 2573.50] home
[2573.50 → 2574.24] rejoicing
[2574.24 → 2575.84] but

[2578.26 → 2578.54] king's
[2578.54 → 2578.76] court
[2578.76 → 2579.18] he
[2579.18 → 2579.66] overheard

[2582.60 → 2582.84] a
[2582.84 → 2583.28] carrot
[2583.28 → 2584.30] what
[2584.30 → 2584.50] if
[2584.50 → 2584.82] I
[2584.82 → 2585.12] give
[2585.12 → 2585.28] the
[2585.28 → 2585.60] king
[2585.60 → 2586.20] something
[2586.20 → 2586.66] even
[2586.66 → 2587.08] better
[2587.08 → 2588.28] so
[2588.28 → 2588.42] the
[2588.42 → 2588.64] next
[2588.64 → 2588.84] day
[2588.84 → 2589.02] the
[2589.02 → 2589.42] nobleman
[2593.88 → 2594.66] and
[2594.66 → 2594.82] he

[2595.22 → 2595.48] low
[2595.48 → 2595.60] and
[2595.60 → 2595.70] he
[2595.70 → 2595.86] said
[2595.86 → 2596.00] my
[2596.00 → 2596.36] lord
[2596.36 → 2596.66] I

[2597.30 → 2597.90] and
[2597.90 → 2598.10] this
[2598.10 → 2598.24] is
[2598.24 → 2598.40] the
[2598.40 → 2598.70] greatest
[2598.70 → 2599.08] horse
[2599.08 → 2599.22] I
[2599.22 → 2599.36] have
[2599.36 → 2599.60] ever
[2599.60 → 2599.98] bred
[2599.98 → 2600.52] or
[2600.52 → 2600.82] ever
[2600.82 → 2601.12] will
[2601.12 → 2601.52] breed
[2601.52 → 2602.32] and
[2602.32 → 2602.44] I
[2602.44 → 2602.82] present
[2602.82 → 2602.98] it
[2602.98 → 2603.16] to
[2603.16 → 2603.32] you
[2603.32 → 2603.48] as
[2603.48 → 2603.60] a
[2603.60 → 2603.86] token
[2603.86 → 2604.06] of
[2604.06 → 2604.24] my
[2604.24 → 2604.54] love
[2604.54 → 2606.26] but
[2606.26 → 2606.54] the
[2606.54 → 2607.04] king
[2607.04 → 2607.66] discerned
[2607.66 → 2607.90] his
[2607.90 → 2608.30] heart
[2608.30 → 2609.02] and
[2609.02 → 2609.14] he
[2609.14 → 2609.48] said
[2609.48 → 2610.48] thank
[2610.48 → 2610.68] you
[2610.68 → 2611.72] and
[2611.72 → 2611.84] he
[2611.84 → 2612.02] took
[2612.02 → 2612.18] his
[2612.18 → 2612.52] horse
[2612.52 → 2613.30] and
[2613.30 → 2613.66] simply
[2613.66 → 2614.16] dismissed
[2614.16 → 2614.40] him
[2614.40 → 2616.34] and
[2616.34 → 2616.46] the
[2616.46 → 2616.88] nobleman
[2616.88 → 2617.18] stood
[2617.18 → 2617.62] there
[2617.62 → 2619.02] perplexed
[2619.02 → 2619.20] he
[2619.20 → 2619.28] was
[2619.28 → 2619.54] wondering
[2619.54 → 2620.30] what's
[2620.30 → 2620.72] going
[2620.72 → 2620.90] on
[2620.90 → 2621.08] here
[2621.08 → 2622.04] so
[2622.04 → 2622.18] the
[2622.18 → 2622.36] king
[2622.36 → 2622.60] said
[2622.60 → 2622.74] let
[2622.74 → 2622.84] me
[2622.84 → 2623.18] explain
[2623.18 → 2623.46] something
[2623.46 → 2623.66] to
[2623.66 → 2623.92] you
[2623.92 → 2624.88] that
[2624.88 → 2625.64] gardener
[2625.64 → 2626.18] gave
[2626.18 → 2626.54] me
[2626.54 → 2626.78] the
[2626.78 → 2627.10] carrot
[2627.10 → 2628.30] but
[2628.30 → 2628.64] you
[2628.64 → 2629.04] gave
[2629.04 → 2629.78] yourself
[2629.78 → 2630.36] the
[2630.36 → 2630.70] horse
[2630.70 → 2632.38] so
[2632.38 → 2632.52] we
[2632.52 → 2632.66] see
[2632.66 → 2632.88] what's
[2632.88 → 2633.20] happening
[2633.20 → 2634.64] he
[2634.64 → 2634.98] is
[2634.98 → 2635.48] shedding
[2635.48 → 2636.00] light
[2636.00 → 2636.46] on
[2636.46 → 2637.10] the
[2637.10 → 2637.88] motives
[2637.88 → 2638.12] of
[2638.12 → 2638.46] so
[2638.46 → 2638.76] much
[2638.76 → 2638.90] of
[2638.90 → 2639.04] what
[2639.04 → 2639.16] we
[2639.16 → 2639.34] do
[2639.34 → 2639.44] in
[2639.44 → 2639.62] this
[2639.62 → 2640.00] world
[2640.00 → 2640.72] that
[2640.72 → 2641.08] we
[2641.08 → 2641.50] often
[2641.50 → 2641.98] want
[2641.98 → 2642.62] public
[2642.62 → 2643.26] recognition
[2643.26 → 2643.84] when
[2643.84 → 2643.96] we
[2643.96 → 2644.14] do
[2644.14 → 2644.56] something
[2644.56 → 2645.08] or
[2645.08 → 2645.26] we
[2645.26 → 2645.44] want
[2645.44 → 2645.52] to
[2645.52 → 2645.64] be
[2645.64 → 2646.08] rewarded
[2646.08 → 2646.44] for
[2646.44 → 2646.66] it
[2646.66 → 2647.38] and
[2647.38 → 2647.68] Jesus
[2647.68 → 2648.28] invites
[2648.28 → 2648.64] us
[2648.64 → 2649.22] instead
[2649.22 → 2649.98] into
[2649.98 → 2650.44] something
[2650.44 → 2650.72] that
[2650.72 → 2650.88] is
[2650.88 → 2651.28] much
[2651.28 → 2652.06] deeper
[2652.06 → 2652.40] and
[2652.40 → 2652.80] truer
[2652.80 → 2653.64] and
[2653.64 → 2654.74] freer
[2654.74 → 2655.52] more
[2655.52 → 2656.18] freeing
[2656.18 → 2656.76] which
[2656.76 → 2657.18] is
[2657.18 → 2657.38] the
[2657.38 → 2657.88] self
[2657.88 → 2658.64] giving
[2658.64 → 2659.36] service
[2659.36 → 2659.76] that
[2659.76 → 2659.94] is
[2659.94 → 2660.06] at
[2660.06 → 2660.20] the
[2660.20 → 2660.36] heart
[2660.36 → 2660.48] of
[2660.48 → 2660.96] reality
[2660.96 → 2662.16] because
[2662.16 → 2662.42] this
[2662.42 → 2662.72] is
[2662.72 → 2662.86] the
[2662.86 → 2663.14] way
[2663.14 → 2663.64] the
[2663.64 → 2663.90] kingdom
[2663.90 → 2664.26] works
[2664.26 → 2664.50] this
[2664.50 → 2664.76] is
[2664.76 → 2664.94] who
[2664.94 → 2665.32] Jesus
[2665.32 → 2665.84] is
[2665.84 → 2666.68] and
[2666.68 → 2667.12] as
[2667.12 → 2667.58] we
[2667.58 → 2668.64] serve
[2668.64 → 2669.00] it
[2669.00 → 2669.46] leads
[2669.46 → 2669.92] us
[2669.92 → 2670.22] into
[2670.22 → 2670.80] deeper
[2670.80 → 2671.50] communion
[2671.50 → 2672.18] with
[2672.18 → 2672.52] Jesus
[2672.52 → 2673.08] Christ
[2673.08 → 2674.34] because
[2674.34 → 2674.80] he
[2674.80 → 2675.20] wants
[2675.20 → 2675.36] our
[2675.36 → 2675.88] hearts
[2675.88 → 2676.38] he
[2676.38 → 2676.62] wants
[2676.62 → 2677.00] us
[2677.00 → 2677.14] to
[2677.14 → 2677.42] be
[2677.42 → 2678.50] freely
[2678.50 → 2679.14] willing
[2679.14 → 2679.84] to
[2679.84 → 2680.30] serve
[2680.30 → 2681.26] with
[2681.26 → 2681.60] no
[2681.60 → 2682.18] reward
[2682.18 → 2682.38] in
[2682.38 → 2682.72] mind
[2682.72 → 2682.94] and
[2682.94 → 2683.22] so
[2683.22 → 2683.72] he
[2683.72 → 2684.02] says
[2684.02 → 2684.16] to
[2684.16 → 2684.30] us
[2684.30 → 2684.44] I
[2684.44 → 2684.72] know
[2684.72 → 2684.94] it's
[2684.94 → 2685.06] going
[2685.06 → 2685.10] to
[2685.10 → 2685.24] be
[2685.24 → 2685.64] hard
[2685.64 → 2685.86] but
[2685.86 → 2686.22] your
[2686.22 → 2686.58] father
[2686.58 → 2687.06] does
[2687.06 → 2687.38] see
[2687.38 → 2687.62] you
[2687.62 → 2688.36] and
[2688.36 → 2688.52] your
[2688.52 → 2688.90] father
[2688.90 → 2689.60] sees
[2689.60 → 2689.76] what
[2689.76 → 2689.88] is
[2689.88 → 2690.08] done
[2690.08 → 2690.22] in
[2690.22 → 2690.48] secret
[2690.48 → 2690.76] and
[2690.76 → 2691.00] he
[2691.00 → 2691.40] will
[2691.40 → 2691.94] reward
[2691.94 → 2692.24] you
[2692.24 → 2693.16] okay
[2693.16 → 2693.38] so
[2693.38 → 2693.72] well
[2693.72 → 2694.12] we
[2694.12 → 2694.36] may
[2694.36 → 2694.70] not
[2694.70 → 2695.26] get
[2695.26 → 2695.48] the
[2695.48 → 2695.94] reward
[2695.94 → 2696.16] that
[2696.16 → 2696.28] we
[2696.28 → 2696.46] would
[2696.46 → 2696.92] hope
[2696.92 → 2697.56] now
[2697.56 → 2698.84] actually
[2698.84 → 2699.40] we
[2699.40 → 2699.66] are
[2699.66 → 2700.26] promised
[2700.26 → 2700.88] an
[2700.88 → 2701.14] even
[2701.14 → 2701.58] greater
[2701.58 → 2702.16] reward
[2702.16 → 2702.58] by
[2702.58 → 2702.74] our
[2702.74 → 2702.96] heavenly
[2702.96 → 2703.36] father
[2703.36 → 2704.82] so
[2704.82 → 2704.98] now
[2704.98 → 2705.46] third
[2705.46 → 2706.06] the
[2706.06 → 2706.40] path
[2706.40 → 2706.52] of
[2706.52 → 2706.64] being
[2706.64 → 2706.80] a
[2706.80 → 2707.02] servant
[2707.02 → 2707.38] what
[2707.38 → 2707.78] does
[2707.78 → 2708.04] this
[2708.04 → 2708.36] mean
[2708.36 → 2708.70] for
[2708.70 → 2709.12] us
[2709.12 → 2710.08] how
[2710.08 → 2710.20] do
[2710.20 → 2710.32] we
[2710.32 → 2710.54] live
[2710.54 → 2710.78] into
[2710.78 → 2711.04] this
[2711.04 → 2711.20] how
[2711.20 → 2711.38] can
[2711.38 → 2711.62] we
[2711.62 → 2712.14] become
[2712.14 → 2712.38] a
[2712.38 → 2712.66] servant
[2712.66 → 2712.92] that
[2712.92 → 2713.14] Jesus
[2713.14 → 2713.38] is
[2713.38 → 2713.62] calling
[2713.62 → 2713.80] us
[2713.80 → 2713.94] to
[2713.94 → 2714.14] be
[2714.14 → 2715.72] and
[2715.72 → 2715.88] as
[2715.88 → 2716.02] we
[2716.02 → 2716.24] look
[2716.24 → 2716.36] at
[2716.36 → 2716.50] this
[2716.50 → 2716.88] passage
[2716.88 → 2717.10] there
[2717.10 → 2717.26] are
[2717.26 → 2717.60] two
[2717.60 → 2718.32] steps
[2718.32 → 2718.66] here
[2718.66 → 2718.90] to
[2718.90 → 2719.34] becoming
[2719.34 → 2719.56] a
[2719.56 → 2719.82] servant
[2719.82 → 2720.80] the
[2720.80 → 2721.18] first
[2721.18 → 2721.42] is
[2721.42 → 2721.60] that
[2721.60 → 2721.82] we
[2721.82 → 2722.08] need
[2722.08 → 2722.24] to
[2722.24 → 2723.24] experience
[2723.24 → 2724.12] Jesus
[2724.12 → 2725.00] serving
[2725.00 → 2725.50] us
[2725.50 → 2726.26] okay
[2726.26 → 2728.04] and
[2728.04 → 2728.22] so
[2728.22 → 2728.38] what
[2728.38 → 2728.52] we
[2728.52 → 2728.76] see
[2728.76 → 2728.98] the
[2728.98 → 2729.34] deepest
[2729.34 → 2730.06] problem
[2730.06 → 2730.26] in
[2730.26 → 2730.44] this
[2730.44 → 2730.80] story
[2730.80 → 2731.02] is
[2731.02 → 2731.42] actually
[2731.42 → 2732.02] displayed
[2732.02 → 2732.20] in
[2732.20 → 2732.46] Peter
[2732.46 → 2733.62] in
[2733.62 → 2733.86] verse
[2733.86 → 2734.22] 6
[2734.22 → 2734.50] Peter
[2734.50 → 2734.98] says
[2734.98 → 2735.56] he
[2735.56 → 2735.76] asked
[2735.76 → 2736.00] Jesus
[2736.00 → 2736.22] Lord
[2736.22 → 2736.40] are you
[2736.40 → 2736.50] going
[2736.50 → 2736.56] to
[2736.56 → 2736.74] wash
[2736.74 → 2736.96] my
[2736.96 → 2737.24] feet
[2737.24 → 2737.72] like
[2737.72 → 2737.90] no
[2737.90 → 2738.16] way
[2738.16 → 2739.00] and
[2739.00 → 2739.12] then
[2739.12 → 2739.24] in
[2739.24 → 2739.42] verse
[2739.42 → 2739.60] 8
[2739.60 → 2739.72] he
[2739.72 → 2740.12] says
[2740.12 → 2740.74] you
[2740.74 → 2740.92] will
[2740.92 → 2741.18] never
[2741.18 → 2741.54] wash
[2741.54 → 2741.72] my
[2741.72 → 2742.02] feet
[2742.02 → 2742.32] it
[2742.32 → 2742.60] literally
[2742.60 → 2742.88] means
[2742.88 → 2743.26] never
[2743.26 → 2743.50] to
[2743.50 → 2744.00] eternity
[2744.00 → 2744.74] like
[2744.74 → 2744.92] this
[2744.92 → 2745.12] isn't
[2745.12 → 2745.24] going
[2745.24 → 2745.32] to
[2745.32 → 2745.62] happen
[2745.62 → 2746.76] so
[2746.76 → 2747.06] Peter
[2747.06 → 2747.30] is
[2747.30 → 2747.94] refusing
[2747.94 → 2748.24] to
[2748.24 → 2748.48] see
[2748.48 → 2748.76] God
[2748.76 → 2749.02] as
[2749.02 → 2749.18] a
[2749.18 → 2749.46] servant
[2749.46 → 2750.60] and
[2750.60 → 2750.80] even
[2750.80 → 2751.06] more
[2751.06 → 2751.34] he's
[2751.34 → 2751.72] refusing
[2751.72 → 2751.92] to
[2751.92 → 2752.04] see
[2752.04 → 2752.20] how
[2752.20 → 2752.58] desperately
[2752.58 → 2752.94] he
[2752.94 → 2753.44] needs
[2753.44 → 2753.64] to
[2753.64 → 2754.12] be
[2754.12 → 2754.90] washed
[2754.90 → 2755.26] by
[2755.26 → 2755.72] Jesus
[2755.72 → 2756.90] and
[2756.90 → 2757.08] that's
[2757.08 → 2757.20] why
[2757.20 → 2757.54] Jesus
[2757.54 → 2757.98] gives
[2757.98 → 2758.24] this
[2758.24 → 2758.74] strong
[2758.74 → 2759.32] response
[2759.32 → 2759.48] in
[2759.48 → 2759.66] verse
[2759.66 → 2759.92] 8
[2759.92 → 2760.58] he
[2760.58 → 2760.82] says
[2760.82 → 2761.20] unless
[2761.20 → 2761.58] I
[2761.58 → 2762.02] wash
[2762.02 → 2762.16] you
[2762.16 → 2762.40] you
[2762.40 → 2762.72] have
[2762.72 → 2762.92] no
[2762.92 → 2763.26] part
[2763.26 → 2763.44] of
[2763.44 → 2763.64] me
[2763.64 → 2764.90] in
[2764.90 → 2765.14] other
[2765.14 → 2765.62] words
[2765.62 → 2766.32] unless
[2766.32 → 2766.58] I
[2766.58 → 2766.94] wash
[2766.94 → 2767.08] you
[2767.08 → 2767.24] you
[2767.24 → 2767.46] have
[2767.46 → 2767.62] no
[2771.54 → 2771.96] relationship
[2771.96 → 2772.28] with
[2772.28 → 2772.42] me
[2772.42 → 2772.72] Peter
[2772.72 → 2774.76] so
[2774.76 → 2774.94] what
[2774.94 → 2775.08] is
[2775.08 → 2775.32] Jesus
[2775.32 → 2775.66] saying
[2775.66 → 2775.90] why
[2775.90 → 2776.08] is
[2776.08 → 2776.18] he
[2776.18 → 2776.40] using
[2776.40 → 2776.74] such
[2776.74 → 2777.28] strong
[2777.28 → 2777.88] language
[2777.88 → 2778.60] and
[2778.60 → 2778.72] it's
[2778.72 → 2779.10] because
[2779.10 → 2779.44] he's
[2779.44 → 2779.60] saying
[2779.60 → 2779.76] to
[2779.76 → 2780.02] Peter
[2780.02 → 2780.22] that
[2780.22 → 2780.42] my
[2780.42 → 2780.84] washing
[2780.84 → 2781.04] of
[2781.04 → 2781.20] your
[2781.20 → 2781.52] feet
[2781.52 → 2781.72] is
[2781.72 → 2781.88] a
[2781.88 → 2782.24] symbolic
[2782.24 → 2782.72] act
[2782.72 → 2783.46] I
[2783.46 → 2783.56] mean
[2783.56 → 2783.66] on
[2783.66 → 2783.78] the
[2783.78 → 2784.08] surface
[2784.08 → 2784.46] level
[2784.46 → 2784.78] yeah
[2784.78 → 2785.02] I'm
[2785.02 → 2785.30] washing
[2785.30 → 2785.74] feet
[2785.74 → 2786.18] but
[2786.18 → 2786.30] on
[2786.30 → 2786.46] the
[2786.46 → 2786.74] deeper
[2786.74 → 2787.18] level
[2787.18 → 2787.46] it's
[2787.46 → 2787.72] about
[2787.72 → 2788.16] cleansing
[2788.16 → 2788.52] your
[2788.52 → 2788.98] sin
[2788.98 → 2790.12] it's
[2790.12 → 2790.26] not
[2790.26 → 2790.42] just
[2790.42 → 2790.62] about
[2790.62 → 2790.90] washing
[2790.90 → 2791.20] dirty
[2791.20 → 2791.46] feet
[2791.46 → 2791.66] it's
[2791.66 → 2791.86] about
[2791.86 → 2792.32] cleansing
[2792.32 → 2793.12] dirty
[2793.12 → 2793.56] sinful
[2793.56 → 2794.12] hearts
[2794.12 → 2794.96] and
[2794.96 → 2795.16] that's
[2795.16 → 2795.44] why
[2795.44 → 2795.84] Jesus
[2795.84 → 2796.24] said
[2796.24 → 2796.64] Peter
[2796.64 → 2797.44] you
[2797.44 → 2797.74] need
[2797.74 → 2797.88] to
[2797.88 → 2798.02] be
[2798.02 → 2798.38] cleaned
[2798.38 → 2798.64] you

[2805.18 → 2805.56] pointing
[2805.56 → 2805.94] to
[2805.94 → 2806.44] unless
[2806.44 → 2806.66] my

[3185.46 → 3185.78] and it's
[3185.78 → 3185.94] this
[3185.94 → 3186.40] glorious
[3186.40 → 3186.88] thing
[3186.88 → 3187.98] and then
[3187.98 → 3188.30] all of a
[3188.30 → 3188.50] sudden
[3188.50 → 3188.96] he's
[3188.96 → 3189.20] struck
[3189.20 → 3189.52] because
[3189.52 → 3189.80] he
[3189.80 → 3190.20] notices
[3190.20 → 3191.14] that
[3191.14 → 3191.36] there's
[3191.36 → 3191.52] a
[3191.52 → 3191.80] woman
[3191.80 → 3192.38] sitting
[3192.38 → 3193.40] in the
[3193.40 → 3193.64] midst
[3193.64 → 3193.80] of
[3193.80 → 3193.92] the
[3193.92 → 3194.44] procession
[3194.44 → 3194.72] and it's
[3194.72 → 3194.92] very
[3194.92 → 3195.34] obvious
[3195.34 → 3195.56] that
[3195.56 → 3195.72] this
[3195.72 → 3195.88] whole
[3195.88 → 3196.08] thing
[3196.08 → 3196.20] is
[3196.20 → 3196.40] about
[3196.40 → 3196.72] her
[3196.72 → 3197.86] and
[3197.86 → 3198.12] she's
[3198.12 → 3199.22] clothed
[3199.22 → 3199.34] in
[3199.34 → 3199.54] these
[3199.54 → 3200.02] beautiful
[3200.02 → 3200.62] robes
[3200.62 → 3201.36] and
[3201.36 → 3201.84] it's
[3201.84 → 3202.18] almost
[3202.18 → 3202.90] blinding
[3202.90 → 3203.34] to look
[3203.34 → 3203.80] at it
[3203.80 → 3204.24] they're
[3204.24 → 3204.60] so
[3204.60 → 3205.32] glorious
[3205.32 → 3206.00] and beautiful
[3206.00 → 3206.28] and it's
[3206.28 → 3206.42] just
[3206.42 → 3206.82] radiant
[3206.82 → 3208.28] and so
[3208.28 → 3209.24] he can't
[3209.24 → 3209.62] imagine
[3209.62 → 3210.14] who
[3210.14 → 3210.96] she must
[3210.96 → 3211.26] be
[3211.26 → 3211.56] and so
[3211.56 → 3211.74] he
[3211.74 → 3212.08] asks
[3212.08 → 3212.22] his
[3212.22 → 3212.46] guide
[3212.46 → 3212.66] like
[3212.66 → 3212.82] is
[3212.82 → 3213.06] this
[3213.06 → 3213.86] so
[3213.86 → 3214.04] and
[3214.04 → 3214.26] so
[3214.26 → 3214.50] is
[3214.50 → 3214.64] it
[3214.64 → 3215.18] this
[3215.18 → 3215.50] person
[3215.50 → 3215.64] is
[3215.64 → 3215.74] it
[3215.74 → 3215.90] that
[3215.90 → 3216.26] person
[3216.26 → 3217.30] he's
[3217.30 → 3217.46] trying
[3217.46 → 3217.78] to guess
[3217.78 → 3217.94] all
[3217.94 → 3218.12] these
[3218.12 → 3218.40] famous
[3218.40 → 3218.76] people
[3218.76 → 3219.90] and
[3219.90 → 3220.04] his
[3220.04 → 3220.30] guide
[3220.30 → 3220.62] says
[3220.62 → 3220.82] oh
[3220.82 → 3221.08] no
[3221.08 → 3221.94] she's
[3221.94 → 3222.38] probably
[3222.38 → 3222.80] someone
[3222.80 → 3223.10] you've
[3223.10 → 3223.32] never
[3223.32 → 3223.56] heard
[3223.56 → 3223.82] of
[3223.82 → 3224.76] you
[3224.76 → 3224.98] don't
[3224.98 → 3225.20] know
[3225.20 → 3225.40] who
[3225.40 → 3225.60] she
[3225.60 → 3226.04] is
[3226.04 → 3226.20] her
[3226.20 → 3226.46] name
[3226.46 → 3226.68] is
[3226.68 → 3226.98] Sarah
[3226.98 → 3227.42] Smith
[3227.42 → 3228.38] she
[3228.38 → 3228.56] was
[3228.56 → 3228.76] a
[3228.76 → 3229.06] widowed
[3229.06 → 3229.44] woman
[3229.44 → 3229.76] who
[3229.76 → 3230.14] simply
[3230.14 → 3230.54] opened
[3230.54 → 3230.74] her
[3230.74 → 3231.10] home
[3231.10 → 3231.28] to
[3231.28 → 3231.62] children
[3231.62 → 3231.90] in
[3231.90 → 3232.08] her
[3232.08 → 3232.48] neighbourhood
[3232.48 → 3233.34] decade
[3233.34 → 3233.80] after
[3233.80 → 3234.20] decade
[3234.20 → 3234.46] after
[3234.46 → 3234.90] decade
[3234.90 → 3237.36] and
[3237.36 → 3237.74] you know
[3237.74 → 3238.04] C.S.
[3238.08 → 3238.20] Lewis
[3238.20 → 3238.54] says
[3238.54 → 3238.78] oh
[3238.78 → 3239.02] well
[3239.02 → 3239.26] she
[3239.26 → 3239.64] seems
[3239.64 → 3239.86] like
[3239.86 → 3240.02] she
[3240.02 → 3240.28] must
[3240.28 → 3240.46] be
[3240.46 → 3240.64] of
[3240.64 → 3241.36] particular
[3241.36 → 3242.20] importance
[3242.20 → 3243.20] and
[3243.20 → 3243.34] his
[3243.34 → 3243.54] guide
[3243.54 → 3243.74] says
[3243.74 → 3243.94] oh
[3243.94 → 3244.16] yeah
[3244.16 → 3244.36] she
[3244.36 → 3244.58] is
[3244.58 → 3245.20] truly
[3245.20 → 3246.16] one
[3246.16 → 3246.30] of
[3246.30 → 3246.44] the
[3246.44 → 3246.72] greatest
[3246.72 → 3247.24] ones
[3247.24 → 3248.62] but
[3248.62 → 3249.16] you've
[3249.16 → 3249.40] heard
[3249.40 → 3249.66] that
[3249.66 → 3250.12] fame
[3250.12 → 3250.78] in
[3250.78 → 3251.06] your
[3251.06 → 3251.68] country
[3251.68 → 3252.74] and
[3252.74 → 3253.10] fame
[3253.10 → 3253.28] in
[3253.28 → 3253.56] this
[3253.56 → 3253.94] one
[3253.94 → 3255.16] are
[3255.16 → 3255.42] two
[3255.42 → 3255.72] very
[3255.72 → 3256.00] different
[3256.00 → 3256.48] things
[3256.48 → 3258.72] and so
[3258.72 → 3258.94] do you
[3258.94 → 3259.12] see
[3259.12 → 3259.38] what is
[3259.38 → 3259.56] being
[3259.56 → 3259.86] said
[3259.86 → 3260.14] here
[3260.14 → 3260.46] he's
[3260.46 → 3260.62] saying
[3260.62 → 3260.82] that
[3260.82 → 3261.16] this
[3261.16 → 3261.54] is
[3261.54 → 3261.70] the
[3261.70 → 3261.98] path
[3261.98 → 3262.12] to
[3262.12 → 3262.44] glory
[3262.44 → 3263.46] and
[3263.46 → 3263.58] it
[3263.58 → 3263.72] may
[3263.72 → 3263.98] not
[3263.98 → 3264.54] look
[3264.54 → 3264.90] like
[3264.90 → 3265.16] what
[3265.16 → 3265.36] you
[3265.36 → 3265.66] think
[3265.66 → 3265.84] it's
[3265.84 → 3265.98] going
[3265.98 → 3266.14] to
[3266.14 → 3266.32] look
[3266.32 → 3266.64] like
[3266.64 → 3267.50] it
[3267.50 → 3267.64] may
[3267.64 → 3267.80] not
[3267.80 → 3267.94] be
[3267.94 → 3268.36] recognized
[3268.36 → 3268.72] it
[3268.72 → 3268.82] may
[3268.82 → 3268.96] not
[3268.96 → 3269.10] be
[3269.10 → 3269.60] rewarded
[3269.60 → 3269.80] the
[3269.80 → 3269.92] way
[3269.92 → 3270.08] you
[3270.08 → 3270.34] hope
[3270.34 → 3270.48] it
[3270.48 → 3270.64] would
[3270.64 → 3270.92] be
[3270.92 → 3271.76] but
[3271.76 → 3271.94] it
[3271.94 → 3272.14] is
[3272.14 → 3272.30] the
[3272.30 → 3272.60] path
[3272.60 → 3272.80] to
[3272.80 → 3273.14] glory
[3273.14 → 3274.26] how
[3274.26 → 3274.40] do
[3274.40 → 3274.52] we
[3274.52 → 3274.74] know
[3274.74 → 3275.00] that
[3275.00 → 3275.16] it's
[3275.16 → 3275.48] because
[3275.48 → 3275.86] this
[3275.86 → 3276.56] is
[3282.74 → 3282.94] very
[3282.94 → 3283.40] nature
[3283.40 → 3283.92] God
[3283.92 → 3284.10] did
[3284.10 → 3284.28] not
[3284.28 → 3284.68] consider
[3284.68 → 3285.28] equality
[3285.28 → 3285.60] with
[3285.60 → 3285.86] God
[3285.86 → 3286.20] something
[3286.20 → 3286.82] to be
[3286.82 → 3287.06] used
[3287.06 → 3287.16] to
[3287.16 → 3287.26] his
[3287.26 → 3287.38] own
[3287.38 → 3287.98] advantage
[3287.98 → 3289.02] rather
[3289.02 → 3289.56] he
[3289.56 → 3289.80] made
[3289.80 → 3290.12] himself
[3290.12 → 3290.52] nothing
[3290.52 → 3290.78] by
[3290.78 → 3291.08] taking
[3291.08 → 3291.28] the
[3291.28 → 3291.62] very
[3291.62 → 3292.30] form
[3292.30 → 3292.48] of
[3292.48 → 3292.66] a
[3292.66 → 3292.96] servant
[3292.96 → 3293.92] being
[3293.92 → 3294.20] made
[3294.20 → 3294.36] in
[3294.36 → 3294.64] human
[3294.64 → 3295.22] likeness
[3295.22 → 3295.40] and
[3295.40 → 3295.54] being
[3295.54 → 3295.86] found
[3295.86 → 3296.02] in
[3296.02 → 3296.42] appearance
[3296.42 → 3296.80] as
[3296.80 → 3296.94] a
[3296.94 → 3297.16] man
[3297.16 → 3297.60] he
[3297.60 → 3297.96] humbled
[3297.96 → 3298.50] himself
[3298.50 → 3299.02] and
[3299.02 → 3299.28] became
[3299.28 → 3299.70] obedient
[3299.70 → 3299.96] to
[3299.96 → 3300.24] death
[3300.24 → 3300.50] even
[3300.50 → 3300.82] death
[3300.82 → 3300.98] on
[3300.98 → 3301.12] a
[3301.12 → 3301.62] cross
[3301.62 → 3302.26] therefore
[3302.26 → 3302.58] God
[3302.58 → 3303.02] exalted
[3303.02 → 3303.32] him
[3303.32 → 3303.86] to
[3303.86 → 3304.06] the
[3304.06 → 3304.42] highest
[3304.42 → 3304.88] place
[3304.88 → 3305.02] and
[3305.02 → 3305.20] gave
[3305.20 → 3305.34] him
[3305.34 → 3305.50] the
[3305.50 → 3305.80] name
[3305.80 → 3305.94] that
[3305.94 → 3306.06] is
[3306.06 → 3306.26] above

[3349.56 → 3349.72] is
[3349.72 → 3349.84] the
[3349.84 → 3350.08] very
[3350.08 → 3350.54] path
[3350.54 → 3350.68] that

[3372.84 → 3372.96] be
[3372.96 → 3373.46] glorified
[3373.46 → 3374.24] we
[3374.24 → 3374.44] pray
[3374.44 → 3374.60] in
[3374.60 → 3374.82] Jesus
[3374.82 → 3375.16] name
[3375.16 → 3375.80] amen
[3375.80 → 3377.86] amen
[3377.86 → 3380.90] so

[3417.96 → 3424.04] I will ever love and trust Him
[3424.04 → 3429.96] In His presence daily live
[3429.96 → 3436.10] I surrender all
[3436.10 → 3441.68] I surrender all
[3441.68 → 3447.66] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour
[3447.66 → 3453.44] I surrender all
[3453.44 → 3460.58] All to Jesus I surrender
[3460.58 → 3467.08] Make me say, Thou holy mind
[3467.08 → 3472.58] Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit
[3472.58 → 3479.58] Truly know that Thou art mine

[3484.72 → 3489.72] I surrender all
[3489.72 → 3496.86] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour

[3552.14 → 3561.40] Now we offer our prayers of thanksgiving and intercession
[3561.40 → 3570.58] May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our rock and redeemer
[3570.58 → 3574.46] Gracious God, You created the world in beauty
[3574.46 → 3576.50] You created us in Your image
[3576.50 → 3580.44] And yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ
[3580.44 → 3586.94] We are thankful for the beauty in creation which we see in abundance during this springtime
[3586.94 → 3591.06] We marvel at the seasons, how You cause the new growth
[3591.06 → 3596.10] Bless those in agriculture who grow the food for us to live
[3596.10 → 3599.80] May we live responsibly, taking care of our environment
[3599.80 → 3604.58] To ensure a reliable food supply for us and future generations
[3604.58 → 3608.34] We are thankful for the communities we live in
[3608.34 → 3610.48] For the services which we take for granted
[3610.48 → 3612.22] For clean water
[3612.22 → 3618.70] For public servants such as police, judges, doctors, nurses, firefighters, teachers
[3618.70 → 3625.92] We ask for your protection for all these and other frontline workers during this pandemic
[3625.92 → 3631.44] We want to pray for your protection over many service workers too
[3631.44 → 3634.52] And be with them, protect them
[3634.52 → 3641.74] We pray for our nation, for our prime minister, our premier, our mayors in the communities we represent
[3641.74 → 3644.38] In Delta, Richmond, and Surrey
[3644.38 → 3646.80] Give them wisdom in their leadership
[3646.80 → 3650.96] Especially during these difficult times of dealing with a pandemic
[3650.96 → 3654.02] As difficult as it is for some
[3654.02 → 3658.80] May we follow health advisories and restrictions put out by our health authorities
[3658.80 → 3665.06] We hope for a day soon where we can once again spend time with family and friends
[3665.06 → 3666.08] And be able to travel
[3666.08 → 3669.82] And especially be able to meet in person to worship
[3669.82 → 3672.46] We pray for our world
[3672.46 → 3677.72] For those in mourning in Israel after such a tragic accident this past week
[3677.72 → 3680.00] And also for the country of India
[3680.00 → 3684.90] Which continues to struggle trying to control the COVID pandemic
[3684.90 → 3688.14] The images we see in our media are heartbreaking
[3688.14 → 3691.90] Of families trying to find medical help for their families
[3691.90 → 3697.06] We pray for your intervention for the academics we brought under control
[3697.06 → 3701.42] There are so many issues of concern around the world
[3701.42 → 3707.04] Tensions with Russia, Iran, China, North Korea
[3707.04 → 3711.04] We pray for wisdom and discernment for those world leaders
[3711.04 → 3713.44] Who attempt to defuse tensions
[3713.44 → 3715.82] We pray for our church
[3715.82 → 3721.60] We are thankful for the technology that we can at least gather via live stream
[3721.60 → 3723.88] Bless our ministry leaders
[3723.88 → 3726.28] For Pastor Jason, Pastor Nancy
[3726.28 → 3729.26] And our children's ministry coordinator, Hannah
[3729.26 → 3732.62] We await the day when we can meet again in person
[3732.62 → 3738.32] We thank you for the baptisms we have been able to witness during these past five weeks
[3738.32 → 3740.44] A sign of your grace
[3740.44 → 3743.80] Bless all those who have received baptism
[3743.80 → 3748.04] Continue to guide them and all of us with your spirit
[3748.04 → 3753.40] We want to bring concerns about persons in our congregation
[3753.40 → 3756.20] We think of those who are living on their own
[3756.20 → 3758.26] Isolated due to the pandemic
[3758.26 → 3762.14] For those living in care homes with limited family visiting
[3762.14 → 3768.14] We pray for Cor, for Carl, for Hank, for Honda
[3768.14 → 3772.10] For Get, Jeanette, and Henry
[3772.10 → 3776.28] And also for those with ongoing health concerns
[3776.28 → 3788.54] For John Ram, John Van Tal, Joan, Pat, Greg, Julie, Grace, Andre, and Shirley Mass
[3788.54 → 3792.20] We pray not only for these individuals
[3792.20 → 3794.62] But also for their families and caregivers
[3794.62 → 3797.22] Remember those who are in mourning
[3797.22 → 3800.34] We pray for George, Art, and Wilma
[3800.34 → 3802.50] And their extended families in the mourning
[3802.50 → 3804.64] Of the recent passing of Kim
[3804.64 → 3807.12] Remember those in our midst
[3807.12 → 3809.50] Who may be struggling with unseen hurts
[3809.50 → 3810.86] Like mental illness
[3810.86 → 3812.86] Broken relationships
[3812.86 → 3814.26] Or addictions
[3814.26 → 3819.58] We pray for the ministries of our classes and denomination
[3819.58 → 3823.72] We pray for the blessing on the meetings of the Council of Delegates
[3823.72 → 3824.64] This coming week
[3824.64 → 3829.92] Setting directions for our CRC North America
[3829.92 → 3835.00] And we think particularly of our ministry to seafarers
[3835.00 → 3838.50] For Pastor Gary Rosa and the other chaplains
[3838.50 → 3842.12] Many seafarers have been separated from their families
[3842.12 → 3843.66] For over a year
[3843.66 → 3846.78] Since they are unable to get off at many ports
[3846.78 → 3848.94] And not able to fly home
[3848.94 → 3852.78] We pray for this almost invisible workforce
[3852.78 → 3857.12] That we rely on to keep the economies of this world going
[3857.12 → 3859.76] Gracious God
[3859.76 → 3863.22] Accept all these prayers in Jesus' name
[3863.22 → 3867.88] And give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer
[3867.88 → 3871.60] And to live faithfully in response to your call
[3871.60 → 3874.36] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord
[3874.36 → 3875.32] Amen
[3875.32 → 3892.96] So just as our Heavenly Father calls us to worship Him
[3892.96 → 3894.68] And greets us
[3894.68 → 3896.34] And speaks to us
[3896.34 → 3897.32] Receives our worship
[3897.32 → 3899.06] He now sends us out
[3899.06 → 3901.10] With His blessing upon us
[3901.10 → 3902.62] So I invite you to
[3902.62 → 3906.18] Extend your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing
[3906.18 → 3909.50] Now to Him who is able to keep you from falling
[3909.50 → 3912.70] And to present you before His glorious presence
[3912.70 → 3913.52] Without fault
[3913.52 → 3915.02] And with great joy
[3915.02 → 3917.20] To the only God, our Saviour
[3917.20 → 3919.44] Be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[3919.44 → 3921.20] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord
[3921.20 → 3922.30] Before all ages
[3922.30 → 3924.30] And now and forevermore
[3924.30 → 3925.18] Amen
[3932.62 → 3946.50] My friends, may you grow in grace
[3946.50 → 3951.14] And in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour
[3951.14 → 3959.14] My friends, may you grow in grace
[3959.14 → 3966.02] In the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[3966.02 → 3968.56] To God be the glory
[3968.56 → 3971.54] Now and forever
[3971.54 → 3974.70] Now and forever
[3974.70 → 3976.02] Amen
[3976.02 → 3981.02] To God be the glory
[3981.02 → 3982.90] Now and forever
[3982.90 → 3983.90] Now and forever
[3983.90 → 3984.90] Now and forever
[3984.90 → 3985.90] Now and forever
[3985.90 → 3986.90] Now and forever
[3986.90 → 3987.90] Now and forever
[3987.90 → 3988.90] Amen
[3988.90 → 3995.90] My friends, may you grow in grace
[3995.90 → 4002.68] And in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
[4002.68 → 4004.46] And in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
[4004.46 → 4008.38] My friends, may you grow in grace
[4008.38 → 4016.10] and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4016.10 → 4027.56] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
