[1052.90 → 1060.66] gospel is that in Christ we are forgiven and reminded of that in first timothy here are words you may
[1060.66 → 1068.98] trust words that merit full acceptance Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners to all who confess
[1068.98 → 1078.26] their sins and resolve to lead a new life he says your sins are forgiven he also says follow me and now to
[1078.26 → 1085.94] the one who rules all worlds immortal invisible the only god the honour and glory forever and ever
[1086.98 → 1099.54] let's celebrate our lord by singing come behold wondrous mystery
[1099.54 → 1114.26] and behold the wondrous mystery in the joining of the king
[1114.26 → 1122.44] god the yo
[1122.44 → 1132.76] In our longing, in our darkness, now the light of my first come.
[1132.76 → 1142.94] Love to Christ who condescended, Lord confess to ransom us.
[1142.94 → 1157.06] Come behold the wondrous mystery, He's the perfect Son of Man.
[1157.06 → 1165.56] In His living, in His suffering, never trace nor stain of sin.
[1165.56 → 1174.84] See the true and bitter Adam come to save the hellhound man.
[1174.84 → 1184.34] Christ the greatest, your fulfillment of the Lord, in Him, we stand.
[1195.56 → 1217.42] So brothers and sisters, we will now, in our worship service, celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[1217.42 → 1223.52] During this Advent season, we celebrate that Jesus, the eternal Son of God, became flesh
[1223.52 → 1226.22] and came into this world for our salvation.
[1226.22 → 1235.34] Then on the cross, His body was broken, His blood was spilled, so that we might have life.
[1235.34 → 1240.02] The light came into the darkness, and we received that light into our hearts by putting our faith
[1240.02 → 1242.46] and our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1242.46 → 1246.66] So that's why this table is a meal for Christians.
[1246.66 → 1252.98] So if you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, if you have been baptized into Christ,
[1252.98 → 1261.36] and if you desire the grace to follow Him in your life, then this meal is for you.
[1261.36 → 1264.74] And Jesus bids you to come.
[1264.74 → 1270.30] This is what the Apostle Paul said to us, that which he heard from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1270.30 → 1276.68] He said, on the night when Jesus was betrayed, He took bread, and when He had given thanks,
[1276.68 → 1277.68] He broke it.
[1277.68 → 1285.06] And Jesus said, this is my body, which is for you.
[1285.06 → 1290.06] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1290.06 → 1297.24] In the same way also, He took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant
[1297.24 → 1299.06] in my blood.
[1299.06 → 1302.44] For as often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1302.44 → 1308.68] For as often as we eat this bread, and we drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's death until
[1308.68 → 1310.04] He comes again.
[1313.08 → 1316.04] So let me just give a word of instruction again.
[1317.16 → 1321.86] Because of our COVID precautions, we don't want to be passing plates and reaching in.
[1321.86 → 1325.70] And so we are going to, like we have over the last few months, come forward.
[1326.26 → 1330.44] So there will be servers here at the head of each aisle.
[1330.96 → 1334.94] And we will have ushers who will dismiss you from the back, kind of row by row, you can
[1334.94 → 1335.54] come forward.
[1335.98 → 1341.52] And as you come forward, come up kind of by household or family.
[1341.52 → 1348.14] And so as you come to the bread, you know, our elders will put a piece of bread into each
[1348.14 → 1348.44] hand.
[1348.52 → 1352.90] Maybe hold your hands like this so they can drop the bread in.
[1353.42 → 1358.90] And then once everyone has it in your family, then you will eat it together.
[1359.48 → 1359.64] Okay?
[1359.70 → 1361.50] And so I hope that we won't feel rushed.
[1361.58 → 1363.66] I know this whole process feels a little awkward.
[1364.10 → 1370.44] But as you come forward, you know, take a moment, celebrate, and remember what Christ
[1370.44 → 1371.20] has done for you.
[1371.78 → 1374.70] And then you can move on to take the cup.
[1374.76 → 1379.22] Once everyone in your little group has it, drink together, and then you can go back to
[1379.22 → 1379.58] your seat.
[1380.40 → 1383.48] Now let me also give a word of instruction about our children.
[1383.94 → 1391.04] We believe that our children are part of the covenant family of God through baptism.
[1392.08 → 1398.60] And so as a denomination, we believe and welcome children to come to the Lord's Supper based
[1398.60 → 1405.40] on an age-appropriate level of faith and understanding of what they're doing.
[1405.48 → 1407.74] They're not going to understand as much as we as adults do.
[1408.26 → 1416.34] But if they, kids, if you trust in the Lord, and if you have been baptized, and if your parents,
[1416.88 → 1421.12] it's a good time for you to do so, then you may come.
[1421.20 → 1424.18] Maybe your parents still want to wait, and that's okay.
[1424.18 → 1424.62] Okay?
[1425.52 → 1429.40] So you can still come forward as a family, and if you don't want to, if you're not ready
[1429.40 → 1432.58] to take the bread or cup, you can just leave your hands down, and that's fine.
[1433.28 → 1433.50] Okay?
[1433.94 → 1438.46] So I will ask our servers to come forward.
[1439.30 → 1444.08] And as a way to prepare our hearts, we're going to sing two more verses of our song.
[1444.76 → 1449.08] And then after we sing those verses, you will be asked to come forward.
[1449.08 → 1479.06] Let's sing those verses, you will be asked to come forward.
[1479.08 → 1486.08] Let's sing those verses, you will be asked to come forward.
[1486.08 → 1502.08] Let's sing those verses, you will be sent moving.
[1502.08 → 1510.96] Come behold the wondrous mystery, slain by death the God of life.
[1511.24 → 1519.62] But no grave could ever strain him, praise the Lord he is alive.
[1519.62 → 1527.62] What a forty of deliverance, how unwavering our hope.
[1527.62 → 1536.96] Christ is power resurrected, as we will be when he comes.
[1536.96 → 1546.58] What a forty of deliverance, how unwavering our hope.
[1546.58 → 1558.00] Christ is power resurrected, as we will be when he comes.
[1558.00 → 1565.00] Amen.

[2168.50 → 2169.50] Amen.
[2169.50 → 2171.50] Let's pray together.
[2171.50 → 2180.30] Our gracious Heavenly Father, we give you praise, and thanks for this Communion Sunday, that
[2180.30 → 2185.32] you have fed us with your broken body and your shed blood, and that by your Holy Spirit,
[2185.32 → 2190.50] you have indwelt our hearts, enabling us to receive you by faith.
[2190.50 → 2197.16] Lord, we thank you for the grace of this meal that helps us to remember our crucified and
[2197.16 → 2198.16] risen Saviour.
[2198.16 → 2204.16] And the grace to follow him as we wait for his return.
[2204.16 → 2208.16] Lord, we give you praise and thanks in Jesus' name.

[2262.14 → 2262.96] You know?
[2263.82 → 2265.70] What's one of your favourite things about Christmas?
[2273.00 → 2275.34] The decorations, yeah, okay, great.
[2275.66 → 2276.10] Who else?
[2277.06 → 2278.10] What's your favourite thing?
[2280.50 → 2281.98] That was Jesus' birthday.
[2282.82 → 2283.44] Anything else?
[2283.44 → 2290.54] Well, one of my favourite things about Christmas is when we get to put up a Christmas tree.
[2290.82 → 2292.92] Who has a Christmas tree in their house?
[2293.56 → 2294.24] You do?
[2294.40 → 2295.58] All right, most of you do.
[2296.10 → 2299.68] My kids aren't raising my hands, their hands, because we don't have ours.
[2300.64 → 2301.72] Your nose is not up yet?
[2301.98 → 2302.44] Well, me neither.
[2302.52 → 2303.44] We're going to do ours today.
[2305.86 → 2306.78] It's in a box.
[2307.22 → 2307.50] Okay.
[2307.96 → 2309.72] Yeah, some Christmas trees come in boxes.
[2309.72 → 2314.70] So, I wanted to tell you, do you know where the Christmas tree came from?
[2315.10 → 2316.96] Why do we put a tree in our house?
[2317.34 → 2318.10] Isn't that kind of silly?
[2319.18 → 2323.88] Well, I want to tell you the story about why we have a Christmas tree in our house.
[2324.52 → 2329.56] It is because, well, okay, I'll tell you my story, and after, later, you can tell me your story.
[2329.56 → 2330.48] Okay?
[2330.98 → 2340.42] So, about 400 years ago, 400 years ago, there was a man named Martin Luther.
[2341.08 → 2345.16] He was one of the Protestant Reformers.
[2345.76 → 2350.70] So, one night, he was working at his church.
[2350.80 → 2357.06] He was a pastor, and he was thinking about his sermon, what he was going to teach the congregation.
[2357.06 → 2361.00] And he was walking home at night, and it was a beautiful, clear night.
[2362.02 → 2368.14] And in Germany, where he lived, they had big, evergreen trees, like our Christmas trees.
[2368.34 → 2375.48] And that night, the sky was clear, and the stars were so bright, and he saw the stars shining through the trees.
[2375.48 → 2376.86] And he thought it was so beautiful.
[2376.86 → 2382.60] And Martin Luther, Mr. Luther, he had six children.
[2383.54 → 2384.36] That's a lot.
[2385.22 → 2394.72] And he wanted to show his children how beautiful it was that he saw the stars shining through the trees.
[2394.80 → 2402.80] So, what he decided to do is he cut down a little tree, and he brought it home, and he tied some candles onto the branches.
[2402.80 → 2408.84] And so, he brought that beauty home, so his children could see it.
[2409.82 → 2417.06] And he told them, it reminds us, it's on the tree, it reminds us that Jesus of the world.
[2417.76 → 2427.64] That on Christmas, we celebrate Jesus' birthday, and that Jesus came into the darkness of our world as the light.
[2427.64 → 2432.34] So, I want to read one verse for you from 1 John.
[2434.04 → 2435.42] This is what it says.
[2438.74 → 2439.74] If I can find it.
[2444.38 → 2445.12] Oh, okay.
[2445.96 → 2446.56] It says,
[2446.56 → 2450.00] This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you.
[2450.56 → 2452.46] God is light.
[2453.20 → 2456.30] In him, there is no darkness at all.
[2456.30 → 2457.62] Okay?
[2457.68 → 2458.38] God is light.
[2458.44 → 2459.92] In him, there is no darkness at all.
[2460.12 → 2463.92] So, whenever you see a Christmas tree, and you see the lights on the tree like we have back there,
[2464.26 → 2466.58] I want you to remember that God is light.
[2467.14 → 2467.46] Okay?
[2467.88 → 2468.42] Can you do that?
[2470.26 → 2470.62] Okay.
[2471.42 → 2471.82] All right.
[2471.86 → 2472.60] Let me pray for us.
[2473.02 → 2478.12] Father, we thank you that on Christmas, that Jesus, the light of the world, came into our darkness.
[2478.48 → 2481.38] And he brought his light and his life into our hearts.
[2481.38 → 2488.00] Lord, help each one of us to receive the light in our hearts, that we would believe in Jesus.
[2488.60 → 2490.00] We pray in his holy name.
[2490.22 → 2490.46] Amen.
[2491.78 → 2492.14] Okay.
[2492.32 → 2494.50] You may, the little guys, you may go to your classes.
[2495.82 → 2498.76] The other, everyone else can go back to their seats with their mom and dad.
[2498.76 → 2510.60] Thank you.
[2510.60 → 2517.24] Amen.
[2517.24 → 2518.16] Amen.
[2518.24 → 2519.24] Amen.
[2519.70 → 2519.84] Amen.
[2519.84 → 2520.20] Amen.
[2520.26 → 2525.74] Amen.
[2525.74 → 2546.40] 1 Peter 1, verses 3 to 9.
[2547.50 → 2551.46] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2551.80 → 2555.42] In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope.
[2555.74 → 2559.28] For the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[2559.94 → 2563.52] And into an inheritance that can never perish, boil, or fade.
[2564.64 → 2568.24] And this inheritance is kept in heaven for you.
[2569.30 → 2577.54] Who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[2578.44 → 2582.00] In all this you greatly rejoice through now.
[2582.00 → 2586.40] For a little while you may have to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[2587.06 → 2601.06] These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith of greater worse than gold, which perishes even through refined by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[2601.06 → 2604.06] Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[2604.56 → 2610.92] And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him, and are filled with an unexpressible and glorious joy.
[2611.54 → 2616.02] For you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your soul.
[2616.68 → 2618.24] This is the word of the Lord.
[2618.24 → 2619.66] Thank you.
[2631.94 → 2633.72] Well, it's great to be with you again.
[2633.80 → 2634.96] I was away for three weeks.
[2636.68 → 2638.24] And so it's great to be back.
[2638.82 → 2641.10] So this is the third Sunday of Advent.
[2641.44 → 2642.90] Already, I missed the first two.
[2644.38 → 2647.58] Advent is the season that begins the church calendar.
[2648.24 → 2650.86] We are a little bit out of step with the rest of our culture.
[2652.24 → 2660.00] Our calendar follows the life and ministry of Jesus, which is the story at the real centre of human history.
[2661.26 → 2663.58] Advent means lots of things.
[2663.76 → 2664.68] You know, it means light.
[2665.82 → 2673.30] It means the evergreens of our faith, which are always green even in the darkest and dreariness of winter.
[2673.30 → 2678.68] But Advent also is a time of waiting and of longing.
[2679.86 → 2683.58] The people of Israel eagerly awaited the first coming of the Messiah.
[2683.92 → 2684.80] It was foretold.
[2685.86 → 2694.46] And now the people of God from every nation eagerly await the second Advent, the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[2694.46 → 2701.34] And it's the second future coming of Jesus that we are considering together this Advent season.
[2702.38 → 2703.70] Why are we considering that?
[2703.78 → 2708.14] Well, that's because that's what Pastor Len Battering started preaching on the last two Sundays.
[2708.26 → 2709.04] So I didn't have a choice.
[2709.58 → 2713.36] But I'm very thankful for Len and his willingness to step in and preach for us.
[2713.38 → 2716.66] And I decided we're just going to continue this theme that he has already started.
[2716.66 → 2724.40] So I've kind of retroactively decided we're going to call this Advent series Come, Lord Jesus.
[2725.26 → 2726.28] Come, Lord Jesus.
[2726.46 → 2730.62] And that is a prayer that the church has been saying over the millennia.
[2730.80 → 2732.12] It's found in the book of Revelation.
[2732.38 → 2738.46] And it's looking forward and longing and hoping for Jesus to return once again.
[2738.46 → 2747.50] And we're considering the question, what does it mean to be God's people today waiting and praying for Jesus to return to renew all things?
[2748.66 → 2754.38] And we're looking to the New Testament letters in particular to teach us.
[2755.16 → 2759.72] After Jesus died, and he rose from the dead, and he ascended into heaven,
[2759.72 → 2769.32] God poured out the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, empowering the early disciples to take the message of Jesus out into the whole world.
[2769.72 → 2773.50] And as a result, people from all the nations were becoming Christians.
[2774.72 → 2779.62] But the problem was they had never met Jesus.
[2780.50 → 2784.34] They had never heard Jesus speak for themselves.
[2785.26 → 2787.38] They never heard him teach.
[2787.38 → 2799.76] So some of Jesus' earliest followers wrote letters to the church telling these new Christians how to live as Christians.
[2800.12 → 2806.72] They passed on Jesus' teachings to them and especially about how to wait for Jesus' return.
[2808.06 → 2811.84] So we're in this series where you'll be looking at a few of the different letters in the New Testament.
[2811.84 → 2818.98] And one of the main themes throughout these letters is that we are a people who are waiting for Jesus to return.
[2820.00 → 2823.32] One of those letters that we have in our Bibles is 1 Peter.
[2823.90 → 2828.62] So before we look at our passage this morning from 1 Peter that Sarah read for us,
[2828.86 → 2831.18] let's pray together and ask for God's help.
[2831.50 → 2831.88] Let's pray.
[2831.88 → 2840.30] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you to hear your word to us.
[2840.40 → 2844.40] Lord, you tell us, even in the book of 1 Peter, that the grass withers and the flower fades,
[2844.48 → 2847.76] but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[2848.76 → 2854.92] Lord, would your word come in and endure in our hearts this morning by your Holy Spirit.
[2855.62 → 2856.98] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2857.36 → 2857.64] Amen.
[2857.64 → 2857.72] Amen.
[2859.52 → 2864.20] So this Sunday, our passage is about hope.
[2865.50 → 2867.42] Our lives are filled with hope.
[2868.16 → 2874.70] The hope of seeing your best friend Sarah on the playground when you were in kindergarten.
[2875.74 → 2881.14] The hope of being asked out on a date or getting onto the sports team.
[2881.72 → 2885.86] The hope of getting good grades on the school paper or a test.
[2885.86 → 2890.34] The hope that you'll get that job or that promotion.
[2891.66 → 2895.32] That your marriage will stay strong and hold together.
[2896.22 → 2902.30] Or that your kids will grow up to be happy and be protected from all the most serious troubles of life.
[2902.30 → 2907.52] We have all these personal hopes for ourselves and our families.
[2907.94 → 2910.36] But not only that, we have hopes for our world.
[2911.32 → 2919.76] During Obama's presidential campaign, an artist made this very iconic poster with just the word hope.
[2919.76 → 2928.50] And during President Obama's inauguration, there was a sense of hope that people felt.
[2929.04 → 2930.46] That we are moving forward.
[2930.88 → 2935.58] There was a sense that there was a new direction coming where we can remove all the difficulties of the past.
[2936.02 → 2938.24] Get rid of the prejudices and injustice.
[2938.24 → 2941.46] And so there was this hope that the world can change.
[2941.56 → 2943.16] There can be a new future.
[2943.76 → 2944.38] There was hope.
[2945.62 → 2950.08] We all carry all sorts of hopes in our hearts, don't we?
[2952.18 → 2955.06] But what happens when hope dies?
[2956.38 → 2962.96] Well, usually when one hope dies, another, we put our, we take that hope, and we put it into something else.
[2962.96 → 2965.98] Another hope eventually takes its place, eventually.
[2968.64 → 2971.80] But sometimes we can lose hope, can't we?
[2973.00 → 2973.20] Right?
[2973.24 → 2978.08] And when a person loses hope, we might say of such people, they've given up hope.
[2978.92 → 2980.86] Sometimes we say that when people die.
[2981.42 → 2986.80] Physically, maybe they could have hung on a little bit longer, but, well, they've given up hope.
[2987.16 → 2988.10] And they just die.
[2988.10 → 2993.00] Sometimes we lose hope that the world can change.
[2993.98 → 3001.18] When the world seems resilient to change and just overrun with things like prejudice and racism and sexism and division,
[3002.06 → 3007.08] we might lose hope and despair and give up fighting for change.
[3008.60 → 3011.48] You know, as people, we need hope.
[3011.48 → 3018.36] It's something that is necessary for our well-being as human beings created in God's image.
[3018.84 → 3020.06] It looks to the future.
[3020.58 → 3022.12] It gives us a reason for living.
[3022.28 → 3025.02] It makes our actions and our choices significant.
[3026.86 → 3030.36] And hell is where there is no hope.
[3032.00 → 3032.10] Right?
[3032.22 → 3034.60] Dante was not wrong in his depiction of hell.
[3035.92 → 3040.18] Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
[3041.48 → 3042.12] Right?
[3042.18 → 3044.32] We desperately need hope.
[3045.16 → 3047.04] And that's why Peter wrote this letter.
[3048.12 → 3053.50] 1 Peter is an epistle of hope, just as the Bible is a book of hope.
[3054.32 → 3062.08] And when the New Testament speaks of hope, there are a couple of wrinkles in that expression that are not quite the same for us in English.
[3062.08 → 3071.08] So when my family is travelling in the car together, if we leave in the morning to go somewhere, one of my kids might say,
[3071.56 → 3075.98] I hope we see a Tim Hortons so we can stop and get a box of Tidbits.
[3077.36 → 3078.48] And what do I say?
[3080.48 → 3081.18] No hope.
[3081.54 → 3083.08] Don't get your hopes up because...
[3083.92 → 3085.08] Yeah.
[3085.08 → 3091.02] But actually, sometimes we do see a Tim Hortons, and they know to hope for this because we've done it before.
[3091.18 → 3091.94] I'm not that bad.
[3092.78 → 3092.90] Okay.
[3093.24 → 3099.92] But in the Bible, hope has the same sense of anticipation or looking forward that the word in English does.
[3100.14 → 3103.66] But the Bible will talk about a certain hope.
[3105.54 → 3106.50] A sure hope.
[3106.60 → 3108.58] Which doesn't quite make sense to us in English.
[3108.58 → 3112.78] And this is the kind of hope that Peter talks about in our passage this morning.
[3113.10 → 3116.46] Peter writes about a sure hope.
[3116.98 → 3123.44] It's a future promise that we can bank on and be absolutely confident in now.
[3124.00 → 3125.88] A sure living hope.
[3126.96 → 3131.54] Now there's a great deal in this passage that Sarah read for us.
[3131.58 → 3132.92] I can barely touch on it.
[3132.92 → 3138.46] But the question I want to ask this morning is, what is this living hope that we have as Christians?
[3138.90 → 3142.56] Especially as we look and wait for Jesus to come again.
[3143.66 → 3146.10] And Peter answers this question in three ways.
[3146.24 → 3149.22] He tells us that our living hope is anchored in the past.
[3149.78 → 3151.50] That it anticipates the future.
[3151.88 → 3154.48] And that it is assured in the present.
[3155.40 → 3156.60] It is anchored in the past.
[3156.98 → 3157.90] Anticipates the future.
[3158.54 → 3160.64] And is assured in the present.
[3160.64 → 3163.54] So first, our hope is anchored in the past.
[3164.64 → 3166.06] Now this may seem a little bit random.
[3166.52 → 3168.32] But humour me a bit.
[3169.56 → 3174.74] Imagine a bunch of boys sitting in a high school cafeteria.
[3176.54 → 3177.64] You've probably seen this.
[3177.82 → 3178.52] So you can imagine it.
[3179.50 → 3182.60] Now one of them, we're going to call Justin.
[3182.72 → 3183.50] That's my brother's name.
[3184.24 → 3185.40] This isn't a true story.
[3185.76 → 3186.74] But Justin.
[3186.74 → 3188.16] Okay, so Justin says,
[3188.16 → 3194.66] You know guys, I'm pretty sure that Emily over there, she's in love with me.
[3195.24 → 3196.82] I can just feel it.
[3197.82 → 3200.38] And they say, come on, what are you talking about?
[3200.66 → 3201.94] Like how do you know that?
[3203.60 → 3206.66] Well, they say, we were, you know, Justin says,
[3206.72 → 3211.86] We were walking down the hall and our arms kind of brushed together.
[3212.24 → 3214.24] And I felt an electric shock.
[3214.58 → 3215.22] Something was there.
[3215.22 → 3216.08] I felt it.
[3217.38 → 3221.12] And then later in PE class, I saw her looking in my direction.
[3222.08 → 3224.00] And the other guys are like, come on.
[3224.22 → 3226.64] Like that doesn't mean she's in love with you.
[3227.62 → 3230.46] Now obviously asking her is not an option.
[3231.58 → 3235.18] Like knowing what her opinion is, is not an option.
[3235.18 → 3238.56] So they're sitting there, these boys, speculating.
[3239.26 → 3239.38] Right?
[3239.52 → 3243.22] And they're not going to know if Emily likes Justin or not.
[3243.54 → 3248.30] They can just kind of go on glances, zings, feelings.
[3249.60 → 3255.34] Now many people in our culture, when they think about religion or spirituality or God or the afterlife,
[3255.34 → 3262.32] similarly, we think about it like it's a speculative endeavour.
[3263.34 → 3263.56] Right?
[3263.60 → 3266.30] We can't see God or angels or heaven.
[3266.90 → 3268.40] We can't know for sure.
[3268.54 → 3271.58] So basically, you can say whatever you think or feel.
[3271.66 → 3272.58] Just go with your gut.
[3273.46 → 3275.46] You can, and no one can say you're wrong.
[3276.08 → 3279.66] That's how people often imagine what discussions about religion are like.
[3279.66 → 3285.12] But now, imagine that all of a sudden, Justin's phone beeps.
[3286.00 → 3287.36] It's a text message from Emily.
[3288.04 → 3292.04] And it says, Justin, would you like to go to Starbucks with me after school?
[3293.22 → 3295.12] Now what happens to the discussion?
[3296.08 → 3296.20] Right?
[3296.24 → 3299.24] What happens to all the speculating and all the doubt?
[3300.02 → 3300.76] It's all over.
[3301.34 → 3303.48] We know what Emily's thinking.
[3303.92 → 3304.08] Right?
[3304.26 → 3305.88] She has revealed herself.
[3305.88 → 3312.36] And the only thing that's left is for Justin to respond to this new reality.
[3313.06 → 3313.16] Right?
[3313.20 → 3317.76] He might not have been prepared at all for the possibility of going on a date.
[3318.52 → 3324.68] But now, the choice is, will I accept the invitation or not?
[3326.02 → 3331.00] Now when we look at this passage in verse 3, Peter begins by saying,
[3331.00 → 3334.36] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3334.48 → 3343.90] In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[3344.98 → 3345.20] Right?
[3345.26 → 3348.42] The early Christians were saying, we have been born again.
[3349.02 → 3351.50] We have found this new life and this new hope.
[3351.60 → 3353.42] We have experienced God.
[3353.42 → 3359.20] And it wasn't based on speculation or feelings or hormones.
[3360.20 → 3362.60] A concrete event happened.
[3363.30 → 3371.40] Jesus rose on a certain day in history and showed that the powers of death that always win on that day did not win.
[3372.52 → 3379.12] And Peter says that our hope is as secure as the fact of Jesus' resurrection.
[3379.12 → 3384.36] And Peter's own experience testifies to this hope.
[3385.22 → 3386.80] When Peter, no, sorry.
[3387.00 → 3392.14] When Jesus died on the cross, where was Peter emotionally?
[3393.28 → 3396.02] He was a man without hope.
[3396.78 → 3401.08] He was not only without hope, he had hoped that Jesus would be the Messiah,
[3401.08 → 3408.16] who would be the conquering hero and free God's people from enslavers to the Romans.
[3409.12 → 3413.34] Instead, it seems like all of their hopes were just dashed to pieces.
[3413.92 → 3419.36] And he was full of sorrow because he had denied Jesus right before he died.
[3420.66 → 3424.22] But then, the first reports came in from the women.
[3424.94 → 3426.94] Jesus is not there.
[3427.06 → 3427.88] He's alive.
[3428.72 → 3429.48] What did Peter do?
[3429.64 → 3431.44] He went running to the tomb.
[3432.30 → 3433.06] And he got there.
[3433.26 → 3434.86] And he discovered Jesus is gone.
[3434.86 → 3439.66] And he left in wonder and in confusion.
[3441.26 → 3443.40] Then Jesus came to Peter.
[3444.30 → 3447.78] Especially before he even appeared to the other disciples.
[3449.16 → 3450.94] And Jesus restored Peter.
[3451.58 → 3453.94] And the hope sparked in his life.
[3454.04 → 3454.96] He had this new hope.
[3455.24 → 3459.76] And it was a hope that was grounded in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[3459.76 → 3465.78] And here, Peter writes this letter to all of these Christians scattered throughout the Roman Empire,
[3465.96 → 3467.64] facing trials and persecution.
[3468.06 → 3474.80] And he says, we have a living hope because Jesus rose again.
[3476.08 → 3479.32] And that means, friends, that the speculation is over.
[3479.78 → 3482.00] God has revealed himself to us.
[3482.48 → 3484.40] He tells us that he loves us.
[3484.76 → 3486.20] That he died for us.
[3486.24 → 3488.42] That he rose again for us.
[3488.42 → 3493.46] And now the choice that each one of us has is, will I accept the invitation?
[3496.00 → 3502.82] If you want a living hope, the only way to get it is through a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[3504.10 → 3506.04] So that's the anchor of our hope.
[3506.60 → 3508.60] It's an anchor that we can rest on.
[3509.18 → 3511.38] And that our hope can be grounded in.
[3512.46 → 3514.60] And secondly, we have a sure and living hope.
[3514.72 → 3518.30] Not only that is anchored in the past, but that anticipates the future.
[3518.42 → 3528.56] The basis of the Christian faith is this wild but wonderful hope that what God did for Jesus,
[3528.64 → 3536.58] when he raised Jesus from the dead, is going to, that he is going to do that for all Christians when Jesus returns.
[3537.22 → 3537.34] Right?
[3537.40 → 3542.94] He is going to raise our bodies to live in God's renewed earth forever.
[3542.94 → 3548.50] Christ's resurrection is the down payment of the fullness that will one day be ours.
[3549.52 → 3555.90] Now the way this passage describes what will happen in the future is like this.
[3555.96 → 3557.74] And he tells us in verses 3 and 4.
[3557.74 → 3559.74] He says,
[3559.74 → 3565.24] He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[3565.24 → 3572.92] and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[3573.36 → 3576.74] This inheritance is kept in heaven for you.
[3578.28 → 3580.90] Peter says we have been born into a living hope.
[3580.90 → 3586.86] And he equates that being born into a living hope as into an inheritance.
[3587.60 → 3591.56] And it's an inheritance that is kept in heaven for us.
[3592.12 → 3597.38] Now this idea of an inheritance is something that Peter is drawing from the Old Testament.
[3598.20 → 3602.40] In the Old Testament, God's people were slaves in Egypt.
[3602.40 → 3606.94] And God came, and he rescued them.
[3607.08 → 3608.10] And then what did God do?
[3610.04 → 3614.54] He, exactly, he brought them to the promised land.
[3615.20 → 3619.14] God gave the land to Israel as an inheritance.
[3620.08 → 3626.94] And in the land, he gave every tribe and every family an inheritance with everlasting right to ownership.
[3627.56 → 3628.88] And that was their inheritance.
[3628.88 → 3638.52] And as they wandered in the wilderness, they were sustained through those trials and those wanderings by the promise of their inheritance.
[3639.74 → 3646.76] And in the same way now, we too are aliens and pilgrims, wandering in the wilderness of a broken and sinful world.
[3647.16 → 3649.82] So Peter calls us in this letter, exiles.
[3650.68 → 3654.68] We are people who are away from our true home.
[3654.68 → 3658.04] We are residing on this earth, but our inheritance is in heaven.
[3658.04 → 3662.56] And then ultimately, in the new heavens and the new earth, when Jesus returns.
[3663.32 → 3665.46] That's where we have our inheritance.
[3667.26 → 3670.58] And about this inheritance, verse 4 tells us,
[3671.22 → 3676.76] it's an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[3678.68 → 3681.26] It's an amazing verse in the Greek.
[3681.44 → 3685.18] Each one of those words, perish, spoil, or fade, starts with the Greek letter A.
[3685.18 → 3689.58] So, three-point sermon, each beginning with the same letter.
[3690.14 → 3690.84] It's in Scripture.
[3691.96 → 3692.76] That's an aside.
[3695.30 → 3696.50] It's an amazing verse.
[3696.58 → 3698.20] And one commentator said this.
[3698.32 → 3700.52] You know, in each one of those words, perish, spoil, or fade,
[3700.70 → 3705.86] has direct connections to this Old Testament imagery of the land and what happened to the land and the inheritance.
[3705.86 → 3708.20] I don't have time to get into each one of those.
[3708.50 → 3711.14] But this is what one commentator said in summary.
[3711.54 → 3717.14] That our inheritance is death-proof, sin-proof, and time-proof.
[3718.02 → 3718.24] Right?
[3718.32 → 3723.68] Those things that most define our earthly existence, death, sin, and time,
[3724.16 → 3728.60] those are the three things that most destroy our hope, humanly speaking.
[3728.60 → 3732.74] But friends, those things cannot touch our inheritance.
[3733.64 → 3733.78] Right?
[3733.86 → 3736.42] Our inheritance is safe.
[3737.34 → 3739.98] Safe from all the uncertainties of this world.
[3740.88 → 3745.02] Safe from all the things that are beyond our control to realize our hopes.
[3745.58 → 3751.18] Safe from being ruined by our own sin and our own failure that so often wrecks our hopes.
[3751.18 → 3754.22] This hope is sure.
[3755.16 → 3760.26] Because our inheritance is kept for us by God.
[3760.32 → 3761.88] We are shielded by faith.
[3762.28 → 3763.84] It is kept by the power of God.
[3763.92 → 3766.94] And we are kept for our inheritance.
[3769.76 → 3773.82] So we anticipate the future with this sure living hope.
[3774.16 → 3778.70] And friends, lastly, our living hope, the hope of our salvation, is assured to us in the present.
[3778.70 → 3781.44] And we see this again in verse 3.
[3781.54 → 3783.94] I know I'm only focusing really on verses 3 to 5.
[3785.06 → 3786.54] In verse 3 again, it says,
[3786.92 → 3792.02] In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope.
[3792.92 → 3800.52] Peter describes these Christians he's writing to as having been born again into a living hope.
[3801.06 → 3805.58] So what Peter is saying here is that when you and I say,
[3805.58 → 3810.20] I want what happened to Jesus in his resurrection to be my life.
[3811.02 → 3811.24] Right?
[3811.28 → 3813.70] I want to receive his invitation of love.
[3813.94 → 3815.42] I want to hold on to him.
[3815.58 → 3821.48] When that happens to you, this whole new life called the new birth happens.
[3821.58 → 3823.66] And this isn't something that only happens to some Christians.
[3824.74 → 3825.72] New birth.
[3826.38 → 3827.84] Being a Christian equals new birth.
[3828.42 → 3830.96] Every Christian has this new birth.
[3830.96 → 3839.38] And this new birth is a work of the Holy Spirit in our lives, bringing eternal life to us now as we put our trust in Jesus Christ.
[3840.32 → 3847.52] And we can be assured of our hope now because God has already begun a good work in us.
[3847.90 → 3850.18] And God always completes what he begins.
[3850.18 → 3858.58] Right now we can have this living hope because God has begun a work in us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[3858.72 → 3860.26] through the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[3860.46 → 3863.50] And he will complete what he began.
[3864.10 → 3866.92] And friends, that is one of the most wonderful things in the Bible.
[3867.04 → 3871.04] That our God, having made a plan, carries it to the end.
[3871.88 → 3874.10] He made a plan to save sinful people.
[3874.10 → 3880.02] And even though that we are tiresome and sinful and rebellious in our hearts,
[3880.34 → 3883.36] having made a plan to save us, God will do it.
[3883.70 → 3884.92] That is who God is.
[3885.72 → 3892.00] It is certain, it is certain, because it's a hope that comes from outside of us.
[3893.42 → 3896.52] Scripture tells us that redemption can't come from humans.
[3897.52 → 3901.02] But it comes from heaven into our world.
[3901.02 → 3905.58] And that tells us, friends, that our hope is not realized.
[3907.52 → 3913.18] Our hope is not in realizing our personal hopes for success.
[3913.78 → 3915.68] That's not ultimately where our hope is.
[3916.12 → 3919.84] Seeing a friend in kindergarten, getting a good grade on a test,
[3919.96 → 3922.06] getting into the university or a job we want.
[3922.84 → 3924.26] That's not where our hope lies.
[3924.54 → 3926.74] Our hope is also not in a political program.
[3927.98 → 3930.06] Our hope is in Jesus.
[3931.02 → 3934.72] And that hope comes into the world as a baby in a manger.
[3936.52 → 3938.98] And it feels so vulnerable.
[3939.98 → 3940.70] Just a baby.
[3941.58 → 3945.08] It feels so small and insignificant,
[3945.82 → 3950.50] especially when we consider how great is our need.
[3950.50 → 3957.56] But actually, that baby grows into the Messiah and the Saviour of the world.
[3958.72 → 3962.44] And friends, what that means is that almost beyond belief,
[3962.82 → 3968.94] the true Christian through Jesus can live with the sure hope of salvation for ourselves
[3968.94 → 3971.14] and ultimately for our world,
[3971.20 → 3974.76] because God has a plan, and he will fulfill it.
[3974.76 → 3978.90] Friends, we live in hope as we wait for Jesus to return.
[3979.78 → 3980.38] Let's pray.
[3980.38 → 3987.62] Father, we thank you for this exuberant letter of Peter,
[3988.16 → 3993.52] who himself has experienced the hope of seeing the resurrected Christ.
[3993.52 → 4000.76] And we know he will come again because he promised to come the first time,
[4000.86 → 4002.40] and he did, and he rose again,
[4002.94 → 4005.36] fulfilling all prophecy and promises.
[4006.36 → 4008.44] And so we put our hope as sure.
[4008.44 → 4013.90] And as Christians, whether living in Peter's time or today,
[4015.00 → 4016.78] wherever we are in our own lives,
[4016.90 → 4021.06] Lord, we have this living hope through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4021.76 → 4024.36] And so because we have that hope, we look forward.
[4025.12 → 4026.12] We don't lose hope.
[4026.60 → 4028.02] We don't despair of hope.
[4028.68 → 4031.90] But we anticipate it because it is true and it is certain.
[4032.54 → 4035.98] Lord, help each of us in our own lives with whatever we're facing,
[4035.98 → 4038.82] whatever trials like these first century Christians we're facing,
[4039.42 → 4043.22] Lord, that we can persevere with them and our faith can be proven genuine
[4043.22 → 4049.02] because we have the hope of salvation and of Christ's return.
[4049.82 → 4051.42] Lord, thank you for your mercy to us.
[4051.58 → 4052.62] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4053.16 → 4053.40] Amen.
[4055.14 → 4059.80] And so appropriately, I believe, our song of response is called Living Hope.
[4060.24 → 4063.34] So would you please rise, and we'll sing our song of response together.
[4065.98 → 4085.34] How great the character that lay between us,
[4085.54 → 4091.18] how high the mountain I could not climb.
[4091.18 → 4096.94] In desperation, I turned to heaven
[4096.94 → 4103.42] And spoke your name into the night
[4103.42 → 4109.18] Then through the darkness, your loving kindness
[4109.18 → 4115.50] Go through the shadows of my soul
[4115.50 → 4118.90] The work is finished
[4118.90 → 4118.94] The work is finished
[4118.94 → 4121.50] The end is written
[4121.50 → 4127.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4127.50 → 4133.50] Who could imagine
[4133.50 → 4136.66] So great a mercy
[4136.66 → 4139.50] What heart could gather
[4139.50 → 4142.50] Such boundless grace
[4142.50 → 4144.50] The God of ages
[4144.50 → 4145.50] The God of ages
[4145.50 → 4148.50] Step down from glory
[4148.50 → 4150.50] To wear my sin
[4150.50 → 4154.50] And bear my shame
[4154.50 → 4157.50] The cross has spoken
[4157.50 → 4160.50] I am forgiven
[4160.50 → 4166.50] The King of kings calls me his home
[4166.50 → 4168.50] Beautiful Saviour
[4168.50 → 4170.50] Beautiful Saviour
[4170.50 → 4172.50] I am forever
[4172.50 → 4174.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4174.50 → 4178.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4178.50 → 4180.50] Alleluia
[4180.50 → 4182.50] Alleluia
[4182.50 → 4184.50] Praise the one who set me free
[4184.50 → 4186.50] Alleluia
[4186.50 → 4188.50] Praise the one who set me free
[4188.50 → 4189.50] Alleluia
[4189.50 → 4191.50] Death has lost his grace upon me
[4191.50 → 4194.50] You have broken every chain
[4194.50 → 4196.50] There's salvation in your name
[4196.50 → 4206.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4206.50 → 4212.50] Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[4212.50 → 4214.50] Your buried body
[4214.50 → 4215.50] Your buried body
[4215.50 → 4216.50] Began to breathe
[4216.50 → 4217.50] Your buried body
[4217.50 → 4219.50] Began to breathe
[4219.50 → 4221.50] Out of the silence
[4221.50 → 4222.50] The roaring lion
[4222.50 → 4223.50] Declared the grave
[4223.50 → 4225.50] Has no claim on me
[4225.50 → 4226.50] The King of kings
[4226.50 → 4227.50] The King of kings
[4227.50 → 4228.50] That sealed the promise
[4228.50 → 4229.50] Your buried body
[4229.50 → 4230.50] Began to breathe
[4230.50 → 4235.50] Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[4235.50 → 4237.50] Your buried body
[4237.50 → 4240.50] Began to breathe
[4240.50 → 4245.50] Out of the silence
[4245.50 → 4248.50] The roaring lion
[4248.50 → 4250.50] Declared the grave
[4250.50 → 4254.50] Has no claim on me
[4254.50 → 4259.50] Jesus, your is the victory
[4259.50 → 4261.50] Alleluia
[4261.50 → 4263.50] Praise the one who set me free
[4263.50 → 4264.50] Alleluia
[4264.50 → 4267.50] Praise the one who set me free
[4267.50 → 4269.50] Alleluia
[4269.50 → 4273.50] Death has lost his grace upon me
[4273.50 → 4276.50] You have broken every chain
[4276.50 → 4279.50] There's salvation in your name
[4279.50 → 4285.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4285.50 → 4288.50] Alleluia
[4288.50 → 4289.50] Alleluia
[4289.50 → 4292.50] Praise the one who set me free
[4292.50 → 4294.50] Alleluia
[4294.50 → 4297.50] Death has lost his grace upon me
[4297.50 → 4299.50] You have broken every chain
[4299.50 → 4301.50] There's salvation in your name
[4301.50 → 4305.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4305.50 → 4310.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4310.50 → 4315.50] Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4315.50 → 4320.50] O God, my living hope
[4320.50 → 4335.50] Let's join together in prayer
[4335.50 → 4347.50] O Lord and Father of the household of faith
[4347.50 → 4349.50] We thank you for the gift of faith
[4349.50 → 4352.50] Worked within us by your Holy Spirit
[4352.50 → 4355.50] We thank you for having called us to yourself
[4355.50 → 4357.50] For consecrating us to your service
[4357.50 → 4360.50] For having set us apart to the sacred ministry of prayer
[4360.50 → 4363.50] We thank you for this day of worship
[4363.50 → 4366.50] And reminder of your promises through the Lord's Supper
[4366.50 → 4367.50] That we could celebrate
[4367.50 → 4370.50] O Lord and Father of the household of faith
[4370.50 → 4374.50] We pray for the church in all her breadth and variety
[4374.50 → 4378.50] Gathered out of every nation, family, people, and tongue
[4378.50 → 4381.50] To be a kingdom of priests serving you
[4381.50 → 4386.50] We pray for those stewards to whom you have entrusted the affairs of your house
[4386.50 → 4389.50] In an increasingly complex world
[4389.50 → 4394.50] For pastors, elders, deacons, lay leaders, volunteers, and committees
[4394.50 → 4398.50] Give them the spirit of willing service and true humility
[4398.50 → 4402.50] Give them a sense of spiritual devotion
[4402.50 → 4406.50] Give them delight in those whom they serve
[4406.50 → 4410.50] Grant them wisdom that they may lead your people in the way of Christ
[4410.50 → 4415.50] And through that be part of advancing your kingdom in all places
[4415.50 → 4419.50] O Lord and Father of the household of faith
[4419.50 → 4421.50] We pray for the leaders of all nations
[4421.50 → 4426.50] That they might know that you have called them to serve their people in your fear
[4426.50 → 4429.50] And for your glory and the good of the peoples
[4429.50 → 4432.50] We especially pray for wise choices
[4432.50 → 4437.50] As our local leaders make decisions around rebuilding of roads and bridges
[4437.50 → 4442.50] And bringing help to all those affected by the devastating floods over the past month
[4442.50 → 4446.50] O Lord and Father of the household of faith
[4446.50 → 4449.50] We pray for those who have special needs
[4449.50 → 4453.50] To all who suffer any sickness or weakness
[4453.50 → 4455.50] Give health and strength
[4455.50 → 4457.50] To all who are disturbed or troubled
