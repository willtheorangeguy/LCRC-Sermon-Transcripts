[542.46 → 544.46] Mackenzie.
[544.46 → 565.08] This is my Father's Word, and to my listening ears,
[565.08 → 575.08] All nature sings and round me rings the music of the spheres.
[575.72 → 585.38] This is my Father's Word, and this we in the thought,
[585.38 → 595.32] Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, with hands of wonders dry.
[597.04 → 606.82] This is my Father's Word, the birds their carols raise,
[606.82 → 616.86] The morning light, the lily light, declares their Maker's praise.
[617.50 → 627.22] This is my Father's Word, He shines in all that's there.
[627.22 → 636.82] In the rustling red sign, in the impasse, He speaks to me everywhere.
[639.24 → 649.10] This is my Father's Word, oh, let me not forget.
[649.10 → 659.24] And though the wrong seems all so strong, God is a ruler yet.
[659.90 → 669.10] This is my Father's Word, why should my heart be set?
[669.10 → 675.26] Oh, Lord, it's free, and the heaven is free.
[675.66 → 680.60] Lord, praise that the earth be glad.
[691.04 → 697.06] So today we will be baptizing Andrew and Jenny and their children.
[697.06 → 701.06] Like the last few weeks, we've had some videos that they prepared.
[701.62 → 705.22] Let you know this week, the video is going to be sideways,
[705.62 → 707.60] and we try to fix it right before the service.
[707.72 → 711.72] We can't do it, but we decided it's still better for you to see it
[711.72 → 713.42] and listen to their testimonies.
[713.78 → 715.30] And so we will watch their videos now.
[727.06 → 750.98] Say, Mommy.
[750.98 → 777.72] Last year, I got pregnant again, and I have NSAID.
[777.72 → 779.72] Now I have two.
[781.42 → 782.44] Hello, everyone.
[782.62 → 783.38] My name is Jenny.
[783.88 → 788.88] I'm so thankful that my families and I are finally able to get baptized today.
[789.52 → 792.66] Before we do so, I would like to share my background
[792.66 → 797.62] so every one of you will have a better understanding about myself and also my family.
[797.62 → 801.56] I came from Hong Kong when I was 12.
[802.48 → 805.92] I have two elder sisters and one younger brother.
[806.50 → 810.78] I studied grade 7, high school, and universities in here.
[811.48 → 818.76] After I graduated from UBC, I worked for a few part-time jobs before entering the banking industry,
[819.62 → 822.06] in which I worked there for 12 years.
[822.06 → 829.48] I met my husband, Andrew, when I was working in a bank, and we got married in 2014.
[830.52 → 836.64] In 2016, I have Jensen, and this is the year when I become a full-time mom.
[837.62 → 841.12] Last year, I got pregnant again, and I have Anson.
[841.46 → 843.24] Now I have two boys at home.
[843.24 → 850.70] In terms of how I encountered Jesus, I believe it's back in 2018.
[852.00 → 857.72] I brought Jensen to the libraries here, and then there's a man approaching me
[857.72 → 860.72] and invited me to their church summer events.
[861.34 → 863.50] I rejected him at that time.
[863.50 → 874.14] But then after I got home, there's a strong message coming back to me telling me to just give it a try.
[875.24 → 880.18] Later on, I realized that this is the Holy Spirit who calls upon me,
[880.54 → 884.58] telling me to go back to Jesus, going back to church.
[884.58 → 893.02] So I went to the event, and I met Susanne and Ages' family, and they brought me to Living Waters.
[894.20 → 897.64] This is how I start going to church every Sunday.
[898.70 → 903.10] In 2019, we joined Let Not CRC.
[904.22 → 907.06] After the previous church moved,
[907.58 → 911.14] in the meanwhile, I also joined the Bible study group.
[911.14 → 916.54] In the Bible, I study words from Jesus,
[917.06 → 924.74] and I'm amazed with how Jesus loved us and sacrificed his life to wash away our sin.
[925.72 → 930.84] I truly believe that he is my only God, Father Almighty.
[931.78 → 936.24] Last year, I attended the baptism class hosted by Pastor Jason.
[936.24 → 941.76] And in the class, I've learned about the gospel and also the Christianity.
[942.56 → 947.06] And now, I feel that I'm ready to profess faith in Christ.
[947.06 → 957.54] My favourite Bible passage is Matthew 4, verse 3 to 4.
[957.54 → 964.72] Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from mouth of God.
[965.40 → 969.02] In this passage, Jesus is being tempted by Satan.
[969.02 → 976.18] We are all tempted by Satan every day, especially when we are weak and lonely.
[976.84 → 982.42] But then we should learn from Jesus on how he resisted temptation,
[983.02 → 987.84] remembering his words with the help of the Holy Spirit, and be obedient.
[987.84 → 989.90] Thank you.
[993.90 → 994.94] Hello, everyone.
[995.46 → 1002.90] I'm Andrew, and today I'm very delightful and happy that my wife and my two boys are getting baptized.
[1003.92 → 1005.90] Just a little bit about myself.
[1006.32 → 1009.54] I joined Latter CRC in 2019,
[1010.34 → 1016.04] and sometimes you will see me in choir as I'm one of the vocalists singing for the choir.
[1016.04 → 1022.70] I'm born in Canada, and actually I was growing up in Hong Kong,
[1023.06 → 1025.48] and returned to Canada when I was 11.
[1026.10 → 1030.80] So I studied my university and high school in Vancouver.
[1031.40 → 1036.00] After graduation, I worked in the bank since 2005 till now.
[1036.18 → 1040.00] So I've been working in the bank for 16 years right now,
[1040.24 → 1044.62] and currently I also own a Japanese restaurant.
[1046.04 → 1048.40] I got baptized in 2011,
[1049.06 → 1053.82] and it was funny that my parents and my dad is,
[1053.96 → 1057.40] my parents are Catholic, so I actually grew up in a Catholic family.
[1058.04 → 1062.10] Never got baptized, and eventually in 2011,
[1062.78 → 1068.94] I started returning to church and believed in God and got baptized.
[1068.94 → 1072.52] Me and Jenny got married in 2014.
[1072.86 → 1074.14] Right now we have two boys.
[1074.74 → 1077.92] We moved to Latter in 2016,
[1078.40 → 1081.96] where we started our family in here.
[1081.96 → 1087.56] So we are happy that after we moved to here,
[1087.82 → 1092.08] and then Jenny is actually my motivation,
[1092.60 → 1097.66] or she's the one that's pushing me to go to church more often,
[1098.04 → 1100.20] and servicing God more.
[1100.20 → 1105.10] And we're happy that today we are finally,
[1105.40 → 1107.26] my family is getting baptized.
[1108.02 → 1115.14] So one of my favourite passages is actually from Corinthians 13.
[1115.14 → 1117.24] So verse 4,
[1118.16 → 1119.28] Love is passion.
[1119.48 → 1120.32] Love is kind.
[1120.56 → 1121.90] It does not envy.
[1122.08 → 1122.86] It does not boast.
[1123.36 → 1124.24] It's not proud.
[1124.54 → 1125.34] It's not rude.
[1125.50 → 1126.66] It's not self-seeking.
[1127.02 → 1128.62] It's not easily angered.
[1129.38 → 1131.22] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[1131.46 → 1133.14] Love does not delay in evil,
[1133.28 → 1134.76] but rejoice with the truth.
[1134.76 → 1135.26] Love.
[1135.26 → 1135.60] Love.
[1135.60 → 1137.36] So that is one of the first that,
[1137.52 → 1139.90] when Jenny and I got married,
[1140.12 → 1147.18] we used it as one of the first during our wedding ceremony.
[1147.62 → 1148.92] So I really like it,
[1149.24 → 1153.02] and I hope everyone enjoys it.
[1153.38 → 1153.76] Thank you.
[1159.14 → 1161.84] And so here they are, right side up.
[1163.04 → 1164.40] Andrew and Jenny.
[1164.76 → 1167.72] And this is their first child, Jensen.
[1168.20 → 1169.98] And this little guy is Anson.
[1171.34 → 1173.84] And so there are a couple of things we need to do this morning.
[1174.12 → 1177.18] One is Andrew will make a profession of faith.
[1177.96 → 1181.48] And then Jenny will be baptized as an adult, of course.
[1181.90 → 1184.48] And then these two boys will also be baptized.
[1185.88 → 1187.56] And so we'll start with Andrew.
[1188.46 → 1188.70] Okay.
[1190.36 → 1193.04] So in the sacrament of holy baptism,
[1193.04 → 1197.26] we are adopted as God's own children in Jesus Christ
[1197.26 → 1199.76] and made members of the body of Christ.
[1199.76 → 1201.76] So that happens even when we are little.
[1202.80 → 1203.62] And in our baptism,
[1203.84 → 1206.90] we are united with Christ in his death and his resurrection
[1206.90 → 1209.54] and are promised the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[1210.68 → 1214.90] And our baptism also calls us to personally respond to God's promises
[1214.90 → 1218.78] by publicly declaring our faith in Jesus Christ
[1218.78 → 1221.54] and promising to live wholeheartedly for him.
[1221.54 → 1223.84] The Apostle Paul declares,
[1223.84 → 1225.24] If you declare with your mouth,
[1225.48 → 1226.44] Jesus is Lord,
[1227.00 → 1229.54] and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[1229.58 → 1230.52] you will be saved.
[1231.16 → 1233.74] For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified.
[1234.40 → 1238.48] And it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
[1239.32 → 1241.02] And public profession is a big
[1241.02 → 1245.00] and a significant step of faith in our lives.
[1245.00 → 1248.46] We profess our faith every Sunday in worship.
[1249.46 → 1251.58] And in every step of faith and commitment,
[1251.78 → 1253.18] we take in our walk with God.
[1253.92 → 1258.64] But today, Andrew is taking another significant step
[1258.64 → 1261.92] of publicly declaring his faith
[1261.92 → 1267.28] and becoming a full participating member of this church
[1267.28 → 1269.98] in the life of this church and in the mission of this church.
[1269.98 → 1273.08] So, Andrew, when you were baptized,
[1273.36 → 1276.36] you were united with Jesus Christ and his church
[1276.36 → 1278.48] by God's gracious covenant promises.
[1279.28 → 1282.36] And we rejoice today that you have now decided
[1282.36 → 1284.20] to respond to your baptism
[1284.20 → 1287.18] by publicly professing your faith in Jesus Christ.
[1288.76 → 1292.26] So, I'm going to ask you a few vows, three of them.
[1293.14 → 1295.94] And with each answer, you can say,
[1296.16 → 1297.58] I do, with God's help.
[1297.58 → 1298.34] Okay?
[1298.64 → 1302.66] So, and this is the way that you will profess your faith.
[1303.58 → 1306.18] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
[1306.18 → 1307.64] sent to redeem the world?
[1308.20 → 1311.26] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1311.86 → 1313.94] And do you, with repentance and joy,
[1314.14 → 1316.14] embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1318.96 → 1322.12] And do you believe that the Bible is the word of God
[1322.12 → 1323.70] revealing Christ and his redemption?
[1323.70 → 1326.50] And that the confessions of this church
[1326.50 → 1328.34] faithfully reflect this revelation?
[1330.34 → 1332.52] Do you accept the gracious promises of God
[1332.52 → 1333.92] sealed to you in your baptism?
[1334.32 → 1336.94] And do you affirm your union with Christ and his church,
[1337.14 → 1338.40] which your baptism signifies?
[1339.84 → 1342.54] Do you promise to accept the spiritual guidance of the church
[1342.54 → 1344.54] in a spirit of Christian love
[1344.54 → 1347.40] and participate in its worship, fellowship, and mission?
[1347.40 → 1348.40] Okay.
[1349.72 → 1350.42] Praise God.
[1350.88 → 1352.74] Andrew has said yes to all of those.
[1353.42 → 1354.84] So let me pray for you now.
[1356.14 → 1356.56] Father,
[1356.96 → 1360.56] your servant, Andrew,
[1361.30 → 1363.74] is here to declare his faith in you.
[1364.40 → 1366.22] Father, with your heavenly grace,
[1367.06 → 1369.74] would you continue to work in his life
[1369.74 → 1371.12] that he may be yours forever
[1371.12 → 1373.66] and may daily increase in your spirit
[1373.66 → 1376.40] until he comes into your eternal kingdom
[1376.40 → 1378.58] through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1380.14 → 1383.50] Father, may you bless him and keep him.
[1384.54 → 1386.26] May you turn your face toward him
[1386.26 → 1387.58] and be gracious to him.
[1388.16 → 1390.88] And Lord, would you lift your face upon him
[1390.88 → 1393.06] and give him your peace.
[1394.02 → 1395.18] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1395.88 → 1396.22] Amen.
[1396.22 → 1396.36] Amen.
[1398.58 → 1400.56] Okay, so Jenny,
[1400.56 → 1405.16] is here to be baptized.
[1405.96 → 1408.40] And Jenny, the sacrament of baptism
[1408.40 → 1409.54] is given by our Lord.
[1409.68 → 1411.04] He commands us to go
[1411.04 → 1412.64] and make disciples of all the nations,
[1413.22 → 1414.56] baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[1414.72 → 1415.48] Son, and Holy Spirit.
[1417.04 → 1418.46] And so the sacrament of baptism
[1418.46 → 1420.48] reminds us and assures us
[1420.48 → 1422.30] that we belong to Christ,
[1422.40 → 1424.74] that we have been baptized with Christ in his death.
[1425.26 → 1426.76] We have been raised again
[1426.76 → 1428.24] with Christ in his resurrection.
[1428.24 → 1430.74] And we, through baptism,
[1430.84 → 1432.34] become part of his church,
[1432.48 → 1433.42] the body of Christ,
[1433.98 → 1434.82] here in Latinx,
[1434.88 → 1436.72] but the universal church all over the world.
[1438.10 → 1439.14] So the water of baptism
[1439.14 → 1441.30] is a sign and seal of God's promise
[1441.30 → 1442.72] to cleanse us from sin
[1442.72 → 1445.22] and to renew us by his grace.
[1446.20 → 1448.18] So Jenny, I'm going to ask you a few questions.
[1448.94 → 1449.06] Okay.
[1450.54 → 1452.20] Jenny, do you renounce sin
[1452.20 → 1453.76] and the power of evil
[1453.76 → 1455.56] in your life and in the world?
[1455.64 → 1457.14] If so, say, I renounce them.
[1457.14 → 1457.54] Okay.
[1460.54 → 1462.76] And who is your Lord and Saviour?
[1464.44 → 1465.28] Jesus Christ.
[1465.92 → 1467.22] And do you promise to accept
[1467.22 → 1468.74] the spiritual guidance of this church,
[1468.92 → 1470.84] to walk in a life of Christian love
[1470.84 → 1472.44] with this congregation
[1472.44 → 1474.04] and with your neighbours?
[1474.76 → 1476.30] Also to seek those things
[1476.30 → 1478.66] that make for purity and peace
[1478.66 → 1480.26] and unity of the church.
[1481.38 → 1481.84] Okay.
[1482.68 → 1483.56] Praise be to God.
[1483.56 → 1486.50] Let me pray for you, Jenny.
[1487.66 → 1488.96] Father, we pray that
[1488.96 → 1491.20] you would be here with us, Lord,
[1491.28 → 1491.72] as we,
[1492.32 → 1493.28] at Jenny's baptism.
[1494.02 → 1495.22] Lord, just as
[1495.22 → 1497.20] when Christ was baptized,
[1498.70 → 1500.62] the Father spoke and said,
[1500.86 → 1501.62] this is my beloved,
[1501.76 → 1503.02] my beloved Son,
[1503.08 → 1504.84] whom I love in the Spirit descended.
[1505.90 → 1506.86] And Lord, just the same,
[1506.94 → 1508.40] we pray, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[1508.40 → 1509.34] that you would be here
[1509.34 → 1511.10] at this moment
[1511.10 → 1512.74] and bless us with your presence
[1512.74 → 1514.00] and with your Spirit
[1514.00 → 1514.72] in Jenny's life.
[1514.86 → 1516.54] We pray in his holy name.
[1516.64 → 1516.86] Amen.
[1518.62 → 1519.30] Okay, so Jenny.
[1521.80 → 1522.20] Okay.
[1523.04 → 1523.88] So you can kneel there.
[1530.30 → 1531.76] Jenny, I baptize you
[1531.76 → 1532.78] in the name of the Father,
[1532.78 → 1535.50] and in the name of the Son,
[1537.26 → 1539.06] and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1540.62 → 1541.02] Amen.
[1544.40 → 1545.30] You may stand.
[1546.90 → 1547.32] There you go.
[1550.70 → 1551.18] Okay.
[1551.42 → 1554.44] And now we do the kids.
[1554.44 → 1555.16] So,
[1557.56 → 1559.94] not only
[1559.94 → 1561.64] are we baptized
[1561.64 → 1563.04] by professing our faith,
[1563.10 → 1563.64] but God
[1563.64 → 1565.34] tells us that he has
[1565.34 → 1565.92] established
[1565.92 → 1566.76] his covenant
[1566.76 → 1567.74] between me and you,
[1567.80 → 1568.30] he says,
[1568.78 → 1570.16] and your offspring after you
[1570.16 → 1571.40] throughout your generations
[1571.40 → 1572.76] for an everlasting covenant
[1572.76 → 1574.22] to be God to you
[1574.22 → 1575.92] and to your offspring after you.
[1575.98 → 1576.66] That's from Genesis.
[1577.78 → 1579.06] So from the beginning,
[1579.24 → 1581.22] God has graciously included
[1581.22 → 1581.94] our children
[1581.94 → 1583.02] in his covenant.
[1583.02 → 1584.56] And all of his promises
[1584.56 → 1585.88] are for them
[1585.88 → 1587.20] as well as for us.
[1588.00 → 1589.22] And so we are to teach them
[1589.22 → 1590.68] that they have been
[1590.68 → 1591.84] set apart by baptism
[1591.84 → 1593.36] as God's own children
[1593.36 → 1595.42] so that as they grow older,
[1595.54 → 1596.78] they may respond to him
[1596.78 → 1598.02] in faith,
[1598.58 → 1599.28] in commitment,
[1599.36 → 1600.16] just like Andrew
[1600.16 → 1601.46] has done also this morning.
[1602.22 → 1603.12] So Andrew and Jenny,
[1603.46 → 1604.38] having heard God's
[1604.38 → 1605.28] gracious promises
[1605.28 → 1606.14] to us in Christ,
[1606.26 → 1606.82] do you desire
[1606.82 → 1607.60] these children,
[1608.20 → 1608.74] your sons,
[1608.86 → 1609.68] Jensen and Anson,
[1610.08 → 1611.52] be baptized today?
[1611.52 → 1612.72] You may answer
[1612.72 → 1613.88] saying we do
[1613.88 → 1614.84] God helping us.
[1616.38 → 1616.90] So?
[1617.80 → 1618.32] Okay.
[1619.16 → 1619.68] Great.
[1620.40 → 1620.72] Okay.
[1620.98 → 1621.44] So Jensen,
[1622.00 → 1623.52] you will go first.
[1623.60 → 1624.38] Would you like to kneel there?
[1624.56 → 1625.06] That's great.
[1625.20 → 1625.46] Sure.
[1627.80 → 1628.32] Jensen,
[1628.70 → 1630.16] it is for you
[1630.16 → 1631.60] that Christ
[1631.60 → 1632.68] came into this world.
[1633.52 → 1634.76] It is for you
[1634.76 → 1636.20] that he suffered
[1636.20 → 1636.66] and died.
[1637.10 → 1637.86] It is for you
[1637.86 → 1639.04] that he rose again
[1639.04 → 1639.78] from the dead.
[1639.78 → 1641.10] and yeah.
[1641.46 → 1642.32] And you are learning
[1642.32 → 1642.94] all about this
[1642.94 → 1643.66] in Sunday school
[1643.66 → 1644.78] and from your mom and dad
[1644.78 → 1645.98] and even though
[1645.98 → 1647.60] you don't understand it perfectly,
[1648.44 → 1649.78] he did all this for you.
[1650.64 → 1651.92] And this shows us
[1651.92 → 1653.60] that we love
[1653.60 → 1654.30] because God
[1654.30 → 1655.36] has loved us first.
[1656.54 → 1656.78] Okay?
[1656.98 → 1657.24] So,
[1658.16 → 1658.44] Jensen,
[1658.62 → 1659.74] I baptize you
[1659.74 → 1661.28] in the name of the Father,
[1662.86 → 1664.40] the name of the Son,
[1664.40 → 1668.16] the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1669.82 → 1670.16] Amen.
[1671.76 → 1672.18] Father,
[1672.32 → 1673.74] bless and keep Jensen.
[1674.84 → 1675.50] Would you
[1675.50 → 1676.88] turn your face toward him
[1676.88 → 1678.04] and be gracious to him
[1678.04 → 1678.74] and bless him
[1678.74 → 1679.58] his whole life.
[1680.42 → 1681.42] And may he grow up
[1681.42 → 1682.70] to know you
[1682.70 → 1683.86] and to become
[1683.86 → 1684.94] your committed follower.
[1685.52 → 1686.52] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1686.64 → 1686.82] Amen.
[1687.88 → 1688.36] Okay.
[1688.58 → 1689.46] You may stand up.
[1691.94 → 1692.88] Great job.
[1692.88 → 1692.92] Great job.
[1694.40 → 1694.84] Okay.
[1696.20 → 1696.64] Okay.
[1696.76 → 1697.12] Anson.
[1697.80 → 1698.50] It's your turn, buddy.
[1702.18 → 1702.94] Jesus Christ
[1702.94 → 1703.88] came into this world
[1703.88 → 1704.58] for you.
[1705.08 → 1706.30] He died for you.
[1706.44 → 1707.50] He was raised
[1707.50 → 1708.08] from the dead
[1708.08 → 1708.74] for you.
[1708.82 → 1709.26] He ascended
[1709.26 → 1710.30] into heaven for you.
[1710.92 → 1711.64] And all of this
[1711.64 → 1712.56] he did for you,
[1713.28 → 1713.68] although
[1713.68 → 1715.20] you can't understand
[1715.20 → 1715.80] any of it
[1715.80 → 1717.44] and like to chew on cars.
[1718.44 → 1719.34] But he did this
[1719.34 → 1720.56] because he loves you.
[1722.54 → 1722.94] Anson,
[1722.94 → 1723.82] I baptize you
[1723.82 → 1724.76] in the name of the Father.
[1726.70 → 1728.14] In the name of the Son.
[1729.04 → 1729.62] One more time.
[1730.10 → 1731.42] In the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1732.24 → 1732.54] Amen.
[1732.54 → 1732.72] Amen.
[1732.72 → 1733.20] All right.
[1733.94 → 1734.34] Amen.
[1734.34 → 1734.36] Amen.
[1734.36 → 1734.40] Amen.
[1734.40 → 1735.00] Amen.
[1735.00 → 1735.64] Amen.
[1739.94 → 1742.78] That was funny.
[1743.46 → 1743.94] Okay.
[1744.06 → 1745.04] Let's pray one more time.
[1745.04 → 1745.68] Holy Spirit.
[1745.68 → 1746.62] Holy Spirit,
[1746.72 → 1747.46] we pray that you would
[1747.46 → 1748.26] come this morning.
[1748.58 → 1749.50] Come on these parents,
[1749.62 → 1750.24] Andrew and Jenny.
[1751.02 → 1751.72] Give them everything
[1751.72 → 1752.38] they need
[1752.38 → 1754.22] so that they may raise
[1754.22 → 1755.52] these children to know you.
[1756.42 → 1756.72] Lord,
[1756.80 → 1757.84] put a hedge of protection
[1757.84 → 1759.18] around this family.
[1760.20 → 1761.48] Work in each of their hearts
[1761.48 → 1762.58] beginning even now
[1762.58 → 1763.64] so that they may know
[1763.64 → 1764.94] that you are their God.
[1765.94 → 1766.44] And Lord,
[1766.52 → 1767.74] empower this congregation
[1767.74 → 1769.02] to also live out
[1769.02 → 1769.72] our calling
[1769.72 → 1771.58] to be the body of Christ,
[1771.68 → 1772.98] to welcome Andrew and Jenny
[1772.98 → 1773.60] and their family
[1773.60 → 1776.18] so that we all may glorify you
[1776.18 → 1776.82] and know you more.
[1777.18 → 1778.34] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1778.62 → 1778.88] Amen.
[1780.16 → 1781.86] I have some presents for you.
[1787.66 → 1788.10] Okay.
[1788.90 → 1789.78] Here we go.
[1789.92 → 1790.20] Jensen,
[1790.48 → 1791.28] this is for you.
[1793.64 → 1794.34] You're welcome.
[1794.66 → 1794.98] Jensen,
[1795.10 → 1795.90] this is for you.
[1797.34 → 1797.72] Okay.
[1802.98 → 1803.58] You can come down.
[1803.80 → 1804.04] It's okay.
[1808.46 → 1809.34] And these are gifts
[1809.34 → 1810.52] for Andrew and Jenny as well.
[1811.08 → 1811.34] Okay.
[1811.34 → 1812.38] I can help you.
[1818.54 → 1819.24] Thank you.
[1819.24 → 1821.24] Amen.
[1849.24 → 1859.64] Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to Him.
[1859.64 → 1869.34] No one else can satisfy, I should come to Him.
[1869.34 → 1879.34] Jesus said if I am weak, I should come to Him.
[1879.34 → 1889.34] No one else can be my strength, I should come to Him.
[1889.34 → 1898.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1898.34 → 1911.34] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1911.34 → 1921.34] Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[1921.34 → 1932.34] No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[1932.34 → 1942.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1942.34 → 1954.34] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1954.34 → 1964.34] Jesus said if I am lost, He will come to me.
[1964.34 → 1973.34] And He showed me on that cross, He will come to me.
[1973.34 → 1984.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[1984.34 → 1995.34] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[1995.34 → 2005.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[2005.34 → 2006.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[2006.34 → 2007.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[2007.34 → 2016.34] We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[2016.34 → 2026.34] For the Lord is good and faithful, He will keep us day and night.
[2026.34 → 2034.34] We will come now to our time of confession and the words of assurance of grace.
[2034.34 → 2038.34] So we will have the words on the screen.
[2038.34 → 2046.34] Our Father, you tell us to be in the world, to love you and our neighbour, to pursue justice,
[2046.34 → 2051.34] to seek the welfare of our city, to make disciples of all nations.
[2051.34 → 2057.34] Forgive us for the times we have despised the world and have withdrawn from those around us.
[2057.34 → 2064.34] Forgive us for the times we have blended into the world and have not lived distinctly Christian lives.
[2064.34 → 2067.34] Forgive us and renew us.
[2067.34 → 2073.34] And now hear these words of grace from 1 John.
[2073.34 → 2077.34] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[2077.34 → 2084.34] If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[2084.34 → 2089.34] In Christ we are forgiven, and our sins are remembered no more.
[2089.34 → 2092.34] Be at peace. Amen.
[2092.34 → 2096.34] And so let's sing our song of renewal.
[2096.34 → 2108.34] In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song.
[2108.34 → 2121.34] His cornerstone, with solid ground, from through the fierce drought and storm.
[2121.34 → 2138.34] What lies above, what depths of peace, when fears are still with shining seas.
[2138.34 → 2143.34] Oh also treads are still with shining seas.
[2143.34 → 2144.34] My love is heard, my all in all.
[2144.34 → 2145.34] Here in the bow of Christ I stand.
[2145.34 → 2150.34] Oh, in Christ alone who took on flesh Furness of God in helpless pain.
[2150.34 → 2164.46] Christ alone, who took on flesh fullness of God in helpless faith,
[2164.46 → 2174.78] his guilt of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones he came to save.
[2174.78 → 2184.78] Till on the cross, as Jesus died, the word of God was set his blood.
[2184.78 → 2195.78] For every sin on him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[2195.78 → 2207.78] There in the ground his body lay, light of the world my darkness slay.
[2207.78 → 2217.78] And bursting forth on glorious day, up from the grave he rose again.
[2217.78 → 2227.78] And as he stands in victory, since curse has lost its grip on me.
[2227.78 → 2238.78] For I am his, and he is mine, come with the precious blood of Christ.
[2238.78 → 2243.78] Lovely Lord
[2243.78 → 2244.78] OK
[2244.78 → 2246.78] Beautiful practitioners

[2259.78 → 2261.44] destiny
[2261.44 → 2265.38] no power of hell
[2265.38 → 2267.52] no human plan
[2267.52 → 2269.06] can ever
[2269.06 → 2270.44] come
[2270.44 → 2272.58] from his name
[2272.58 → 2275.40] till he returns
[2275.40 → 2278.02] or calls me home
[2278.02 → 2279.98] here in the power
[2279.98 → 2281.82] of Christ
[2281.82 → 2283.68] I'll stand
[2289.78 → 2297.86] good morning again
[2297.86 → 2300.00] in this season of Easter
[2300.00 → 2302.40] we are considering what it means for us
[2302.40 → 2303.96] to be people
[2303.96 → 2305.56] defined by Christ
[2305.56 → 2308.04] by who Christ is
[2308.04 → 2309.98] and who we are
[2309.98 → 2310.64] in Christ
[2310.64 → 2313.98] to be defined by the person and purpose
[2313.98 → 2314.56] of Christ
[2314.56 → 2317.58] especially when there are so many things in our culture
[2317.58 → 2319.44] and in our world
[2319.44 → 2321.22] that seek to define who we are
[2321.22 → 2323.98] and the way we're going to consider this
[2323.98 → 2325.84] is through a sermon series called
[2325.84 → 2326.48] You Are
[2326.48 → 2329.26] so each week over the next few weeks
[2329.26 → 2331.10] we will consider one of the titles
[2331.10 → 2333.68] that we are given as Christians
[2333.68 → 2334.64] in the New Testament
[2334.64 → 2338.20] so last week we considered this first title
[2338.20 → 2340.46] the title of disciple
[2340.46 → 2343.72] and so we talked about how being a disciple
[2343.72 → 2345.80] is not about a program that we follow
[2345.80 → 2348.54] but it's simply to hear the call of Jesus
[2348.54 → 2349.98] that comes to us by grace
[2349.98 → 2352.40] and then to submit our lives
[2352.40 → 2354.44] to his lordship
[2354.44 → 2356.42] and to follow him in obedience
[2356.42 → 2358.84] and so that's very essential
[2358.84 → 2360.52] to what it means to be a Christian
[2360.52 → 2362.58] that we are disciples of Jesus
[2362.58 → 2363.82] that we follow Jesus
[2363.82 → 2365.54] that we submit to him
[2365.54 → 2367.12] and now
[2367.12 → 2368.58] as disciples
[2368.58 → 2370.28] when Jesus calls us
[2370.28 → 2372.22] what Jesus calls us to be
[2372.22 → 2373.54] first and foremost
[2373.54 → 2375.28] is witnesses
[2375.28 → 2377.16] and that's the title
[2377.16 → 2378.76] that I want us to look at today
[2378.76 → 2381.44] that we are to be conduits
[2381.44 → 2383.12] by which Jesus is made known
[2383.12 → 2385.22] in a world
[2385.22 → 2386.48] that is lost
[2386.48 → 2388.42] but that he loves
[2388.42 → 2389.08] and is seeking
[2389.08 → 2390.22] to redeem
[2390.22 → 2392.74] in Acts
[2392.74 → 2394.92] chapter 1 verse 8
[2394.92 → 2396.04] which we'll put on the screen
[2396.04 → 2398.20] we're told that the disciples
[2398.20 → 2399.68] gathered around Jesus
[2399.68 → 2401.24] after he was raised from the dead
[2401.24 → 2402.56] this is the day of his ascension
[2402.56 → 2404.94] and Jesus said to his disciples
[2404.94 → 2406.66] you will receive power
[2406.66 → 2408.42] when the Holy Spirit comes on you
[2408.42 → 2411.40] and you will be my witnesses
[2411.40 → 2412.72] in Jerusalem
[2412.72 → 2413.90] and all Judea
[2413.90 → 2414.64] and Samaria
[2414.64 → 2415.84] and to the ends of the earth
[2415.84 → 2417.80] and when Jesus says
[2417.80 → 2419.20] you will be my witnesses
[2419.20 → 2421.32] he means
[2421.32 → 2423.24] that you will proclaim
[2423.24 → 2424.98] to others
[2424.98 → 2426.72] what you have seen
[2426.72 → 2428.50] what you have heard
[2428.50 → 2430.34] and what you have experienced of me
[2430.34 → 2431.88] you know
[2431.88 → 2433.46] because the deep longing
[2433.46 → 2434.98] of the human soul
[2434.98 → 2436.20] is to be connected
[2436.20 → 2437.50] to our ultimate purpose
[2437.50 → 2439.10] our purpose
[2439.10 → 2441.76] is to be reunited to God
[2441.76 → 2443.24] the God who made you
[2443.24 → 2443.90] and loves you
[2443.90 → 2445.76] and so our great dilemma
[2445.76 → 2447.84] is our brokenness
[2447.84 → 2448.92] the broken relationship
[2448.92 → 2450.14] we have with God
[2450.14 → 2451.44] but the great answer
[2451.44 → 2452.20] to that dilemma
[2452.20 → 2453.52] is that we can be restored
[2453.52 → 2454.10] and healed
[2454.10 → 2455.44] through faith in Jesus
[2455.44 → 2457.50] that's the reality
[2457.50 → 2459.00] that Jesus calls us
[2459.00 → 2460.46] to go and be witnesses of
[2460.46 → 2462.14] Jesus said this
[2462.14 → 2463.36] to his first disciples
[2463.36 → 2464.16] in Acts
[2464.16 → 2464.76] he says
[2464.76 → 2465.68] you will be my witnesses
[2465.68 → 2467.22] and friends
[2467.22 → 2468.58] he continues to say that
[2468.58 → 2469.38] to us today
[2469.38 → 2471.52] and so I think
[2471.52 → 2472.30] one of the passages
[2472.30 → 2473.42] that is so helpful
[2473.42 → 2474.14] when it comes
[2474.14 → 2475.36] to what it looks like
[2475.36 → 2476.28] to be a witness
[2476.28 → 2477.34] is this passage
[2477.34 → 2478.30] we're going to look at today
[2478.30 → 2480.94] from Colossians chapter 4
[2480.94 → 2482.52] okay so Colossians chapter 4
[2482.52 → 2483.62] if you have a Bible
[2483.62 → 2484.58] I invite you to open it
[2484.58 → 2485.66] we'll also have it here
[2485.66 → 2486.60] on the screen for you
[2486.60 → 2489.54] so we'll read chapter 4
[2489.54 → 2490.56] verses 2-6
[2490.56 → 2496.12] Devote yourselves to prayer
[2496.12 → 2498.70] being watchful and thankful
[2498.70 → 2500.60] and pray for us too
[2500.60 → 2501.98] that God may open a door
[2501.98 → 2502.94] for our message
[2502.94 → 2504.64] so that we may proclaim
[2504.64 → 2505.88] the mystery of Christ
[2505.88 → 2507.76] for which I am in chains
[2507.76 → 2510.62] pray that I may proclaim it clearly
[2510.62 → 2511.56] as I should
[2511.56 → 2513.34] be wise in the way
[2513.34 → 2514.42] you act toward outsiders
[2514.42 → 2516.88] make the most of every opportunity
[2516.88 → 2519.00] let your conversation
[2519.00 → 2520.26] be always full of grace
[2520.26 → 2521.28] seasoned with salt
[2521.28 → 2522.70] so that you may know
[2522.70 → 2524.26] how to answer everyone
[2524.26 → 2527.30] this is God's word
[2527.30 → 2528.10] let's pray
[2528.10 → 2530.98] Father we come before you
[2530.98 → 2532.20] and we come before
[2532.20 → 2534.18] your holy and inspired word
[2534.18 → 2534.70] this morning
[2534.70 → 2536.18] because we know
[2536.18 → 2537.28] that this is the reality
[2537.28 → 2539.46] that we are witnesses to
[2539.46 → 2541.30] Lord it has come to us
[2541.30 → 2542.04] by your grace
[2542.04 → 2543.12] and it is the reality
[2543.12 → 2544.06] that you have called us
[2544.06 → 2544.94] to share with people
[2544.94 → 2545.94] we love around us
[2545.94 → 2547.68] Lord in this passage
[2547.68 → 2548.46] teach us
[2548.46 → 2550.10] what it would be
[2550.10 → 2551.62] and mean for us
[2551.62 → 2552.66] to be your witnesses
[2552.66 → 2553.30] in this world
[2553.30 → 2554.88] we pray in Jesus name
[2554.88 → 2555.36] Amen
[2555.36 → 2558.26] so my hope
[2558.26 → 2559.36] for us today
[2559.36 → 2560.88] is to talk about
[2560.88 → 2561.50] this topic
[2561.50 → 2562.54] of being witnesses
[2562.54 → 2564.42] in a way that
[2564.42 → 2566.14] makes sense of scripture
[2566.14 → 2567.60] but is also very
[2567.60 → 2568.56] encouraging
[2568.56 → 2569.74] and is life giving
[2569.74 → 2571.22] and I hope
[2571.22 → 2572.32] that through his word
[2572.32 → 2573.14] God would really
[2573.14 → 2574.14] give us a vision
[2574.14 → 2575.36] of what it looks like
[2575.36 → 2576.36] to be his witnesses
[2576.36 → 2578.28] that is normal
[2578.28 → 2579.36] that's just like
[2579.36 → 2580.08] a normal part
[2580.08 → 2580.98] of the Christian life
[2580.98 → 2581.74] and that is actually
[2581.74 → 2582.86] very healthy
[2582.86 → 2584.34] and fun
[2584.34 → 2586.54] and as we talk
[2586.54 → 2587.36] about being witnesses
[2587.36 → 2588.20] another word
[2588.20 → 2588.78] that we have
[2588.78 → 2590.12] in our Christian vocabulary
[2590.12 → 2591.48] to talk about this
[2591.48 → 2593.44] is the word evangelism
[2593.44 → 2595.82] so that's what
[2595.82 → 2596.94] we're talking about today
[2596.94 → 2598.98] so there are two things
[2598.98 → 2600.08] I want us to look at
[2600.08 → 2601.02] from this passage
[2601.02 → 2602.14] first and foremost
[2602.14 → 2603.76] looking at God's sovereignty
[2603.76 → 2605.08] okay God's sovereignty
[2605.08 → 2606.68] what does it mean for us
[2606.68 → 2608.58] to have a firm belief
[2608.58 → 2609.48] in God's sovereignty
[2609.48 → 2610.38] and evangelism
[2610.38 → 2611.66] and then secondly
[2611.66 → 2612.42] we're going to look at
[2612.42 → 2613.42] our responsibility
[2613.42 → 2615.00] and those things
[2615.00 → 2615.92] that are always together
[2615.92 → 2616.34] in scripture
[2616.34 → 2617.14] God's sovereignty
[2617.14 → 2618.18] and our responsibility
[2618.18 → 2619.94] so the first point
[2619.94 → 2620.60] we have there
[2620.60 → 2621.90] is God's sovereignty
[2621.90 → 2623.62] and this is where
[2623.62 → 2625.48] our passage begins
[2625.48 → 2626.98] it begins with
[2626.98 → 2627.60] God's sovereignty
[2627.60 → 2628.50] and a belief
[2628.50 → 2629.32] in God's sovereignty
[2629.32 → 2630.58] in evangelism
[2630.58 → 2631.82] really should be
[2631.82 → 2633.44] profoundly comforting
[2633.44 → 2635.18] and energizing
[2635.18 → 2635.92] and encouraging
[2635.92 → 2636.74] right
[2636.74 → 2637.40] this is what
[2637.40 → 2638.18] should be able
[2638.18 → 2639.02] to actually
[2639.02 → 2640.24] propel us out
[2640.24 → 2641.80] into the world
[2641.80 → 2643.02] with any sort of confidence
[2643.02 → 2643.80] that people
[2643.80 → 2644.78] can truly
[2644.78 → 2646.00] encounter the gospel
[2646.00 → 2647.40] and then be completely
[2647.40 → 2649.26] transformed by it
[2649.26 → 2651.14] we can have confidence
[2651.14 → 2651.80] that God
[2651.80 → 2653.20] is powerful
[2653.20 → 2654.84] and that he is at work
[2654.84 → 2657.36] and this helps us
[2657.36 → 2657.50] you know
[2657.50 → 2658.84] when it comes to evangelism
[2658.84 → 2660.08] to approach it
[2660.08 → 2661.56] and think about it
[2661.56 → 2662.78] with no kind of
[2662.78 → 2664.12] weirdness
[2664.12 → 2666.48] or awkwardness
[2666.48 → 2667.88] but just having
[2667.88 → 2668.90] the sense of
[2668.90 → 2669.54] you know
[2669.54 → 2670.62] God is sovereign
[2670.62 → 2672.64] he is mighty
[2672.64 → 2673.62] and powerful
[2673.62 → 2674.98] in all things
[2674.98 → 2676.08] including
[2676.08 → 2677.98] in talking to
[2677.98 → 2678.54] my friends
[2678.54 → 2679.30] about Jesus
[2679.30 → 2681.08] and we see
[2681.08 → 2681.70] God's sovereignty
[2681.70 → 2682.34] in this passage
[2682.34 → 2683.06] in two ways
[2683.06 → 2684.36] first
[2684.36 → 2686.06] Paul begins here
[2686.06 → 2686.88] with a word
[2686.88 → 2687.66] of encouragement
[2687.66 → 2688.72] for us about prayer
[2688.72 → 2690.48] so in verse 2
[2690.48 → 2692.24] which we'll put up
[2692.24 → 2692.70] on the screen
[2692.70 → 2694.60] Paul says
[2694.60 → 2696.30] devote yourselves
[2696.30 → 2697.16] to prayer
[2697.16 → 2698.58] being watchful
[2698.58 → 2699.86] and thankful
[2699.86 → 2702.30] so a preacher
[2702.30 → 2702.90] was speaking
[2702.90 → 2703.46] on this topic
[2703.46 → 2703.86] of prayer
[2703.86 → 2704.46] one Sunday
[2704.46 → 2705.64] and there was
[2705.64 → 2706.22] a child
[2706.22 → 2707.58] in the back
[2707.58 → 2708.16] who was making
[2708.16 → 2709.72] quite a ruckus
[2709.72 → 2710.96] Anson and Jensen
[2710.96 → 2711.94] are being very quiet
[2711.94 → 2712.40] and listening
[2712.40 → 2713.02] that's great
[2713.02 → 2716.04] but some kid
[2716.04 → 2716.68] was in the back
[2716.68 → 2717.52] was making a ruckus
[2717.52 → 2718.48] and despite repeated
[2718.48 → 2720.12] attempts by the parents
[2720.12 → 2721.72] including bribes
[2721.72 → 2722.98] and threats
[2722.98 → 2724.50] he refused
[2724.50 → 2725.14] to cooperate
[2725.14 → 2727.16] finally the exasperated
[2727.16 → 2728.10] parents picked up
[2728.10 → 2728.60] the child
[2728.60 → 2729.40] and headed
[2729.40 → 2730.18] to the exit
[2730.18 → 2732.00] knowing what
[2732.00 → 2732.76] awaited him
[2732.76 → 2733.86] this clever
[2733.86 → 2734.64] young lad
[2734.64 → 2735.36] called out
[2735.36 → 2736.58] would the congregation
[2736.58 → 2738.00] please pray for me
[2738.00 → 2741.58] and that is
[2741.58 → 2742.26] that moment
[2742.26 → 2743.22] of desperation
[2743.22 → 2744.28] that we sometimes
[2744.28 → 2744.80] experience
[2744.80 → 2746.30] where we are
[2746.30 → 2747.02] facing this
[2747.02 → 2748.08] situation
[2748.08 → 2749.28] we are in trouble
[2749.28 → 2750.06] and we want
[2750.06 → 2750.76] everybody
[2750.76 → 2752.42] to pray for us
[2752.42 → 2754.20] and then our passage
[2754.20 → 2755.02] Paul begins here
[2755.02 → 2756.34] asking the Colossians
[2756.34 → 2757.46] to pray
[2757.46 → 2759.64] and in the context
[2759.64 → 2760.96] of this passage
[2760.96 → 2761.52] and the surrounding
[2761.52 → 2761.90] verses
[2761.90 → 2764.02] we can see
[2764.02 → 2764.82] that he's talking
[2764.82 → 2765.58] about prayer
[2765.58 → 2766.36] that's linked
[2766.36 → 2767.06] to witness
[2767.06 → 2768.88] and what Paul's
[2768.88 → 2770.20] encouraging them
[2770.20 → 2770.82] to do
[2770.82 → 2771.42] is to pray
[2771.42 → 2771.96] that God
[2771.96 → 2772.88] would bring people
[2772.88 → 2774.98] who do not know him
[2774.98 → 2776.58] to know him
[2776.58 → 2777.36] right
[2777.36 → 2778.66] it's very, very simple
[2778.66 → 2780.16] but it's incredibly
[2780.16 → 2781.04] profound
[2781.04 → 2782.76] and this is
[2782.76 → 2784.06] where Paul starts
[2784.06 → 2785.80] and the thing is
[2785.80 → 2786.48] friends
[2786.48 → 2787.58] that if we don't
[2787.58 → 2788.30] start there
[2788.30 → 2789.88] when we go
[2789.88 → 2790.58] to be witnesses
[2790.58 → 2791.76] it kind of all
[2791.76 → 2792.78] goes off the rails
[2792.78 → 2793.74] if we don't start
[2793.74 → 2794.92] where Paul starts
[2794.92 → 2796.12] because think about
[2796.12 → 2796.40] this
[2796.40 → 2797.10] we often
[2797.10 → 2797.96] when we think
[2797.96 → 2798.96] about being witnesses
[2798.96 → 2799.64] about sharing
[2799.64 → 2800.16] our faith
[2800.16 → 2801.96] we often begin
[2801.96 → 2802.46] by thinking
[2802.46 → 2803.12] about our
[2803.12 → 2803.90] responsibilities
[2803.90 → 2805.64] so we think
[2805.64 → 2806.36] well what am I
[2806.36 → 2807.44] supposed to say
[2807.44 → 2808.34] you know
[2808.34 → 2809.26] what if I say
[2809.26 → 2810.10] the wrong thing
[2810.10 → 2811.86] what if I say
[2811.86 → 2812.64] too much
[2812.64 → 2813.62] what if I don't
[2813.62 → 2814.26] say enough
[2814.26 → 2816.56] what if they
[2816.56 → 2817.10] never want to
[2817.10 → 2817.98] talk to me again
[2817.98 → 2818.88] all right
[2818.88 → 2819.50] those are the sort
[2819.50 → 2819.98] of questions
[2819.98 → 2821.02] we ask ourselves
[2821.02 → 2821.94] and that is
[2821.94 → 2822.88] beginning being a
[2822.88 → 2823.44] witness with
[2823.44 → 2823.88] ourselves
[2823.88 → 2826.16] on the other
[2826.16 → 2827.02] side of things
[2827.02 → 2827.78] we can begin
[2827.78 → 2829.98] with the other
[2829.98 → 2830.74] we can begin
[2830.74 → 2831.52] with those
[2831.52 → 2832.16] non-Christian
[2832.16 → 2832.88] friends and
[2832.88 → 2833.76] family members
[2833.76 → 2834.46] co-workers
[2834.46 → 2836.26] that we want
[2836.26 → 2836.94] to share Christ
[2836.94 → 2837.36] with
[2837.36 → 2838.50] and so then we
[2838.50 → 2839.08] can think
[2839.08 → 2840.08] about these
[2840.08 → 2840.48] people
[2840.48 → 2841.02] and we can
[2841.02 → 2841.50] think you know
[2841.50 → 2842.14] they have so
[2842.14 → 2843.38] many questions
[2843.38 → 2844.02] and objections
[2844.02 → 2845.10] to the faith
[2845.10 → 2846.14] you know
[2846.14 → 2846.72] it just doesn't
[2846.72 → 2847.14] seem like
[2847.14 → 2847.80] they're interested
[2847.80 → 2848.64] at all
[2848.64 → 2849.72] in spiritual
[2849.72 → 2850.46] things
[2850.46 → 2851.50] and so we
[2851.50 → 2852.08] begin with
[2852.08 → 2852.64] thinking about
[2852.64 → 2853.46] these people
[2853.46 → 2854.20] that we are
[2854.20 → 2854.68] called to be
[2854.68 → 2855.38] witnesses to
[2855.38 → 2857.60] but when we
[2857.60 → 2858.20] begin with
[2858.20 → 2858.94] ourselves
[2858.94 → 2860.08] or with
[2860.08 → 2860.46] others
[2860.46 → 2860.80] what can
[2860.80 → 2861.60] often happen
[2861.60 → 2862.32] is we
[2862.32 → 2863.26] tie ourselves
[2863.26 → 2863.88] up
[2863.88 → 2864.96] and we
[2864.96 → 2865.50] lose the
[2865.50 → 2865.86] nerve
[2865.86 → 2868.02] and what's
[2868.02 → 2868.66] great about
[2868.66 → 2868.98] what Paul
[2868.98 → 2869.52] says here
[2869.52 → 2870.32] is he says
[2870.32 → 2870.92] no
[2870.92 → 2872.46] where we
[2872.46 → 2872.88] need to
[2872.88 → 2873.32] begin
[2873.32 → 2874.10] is with
[2874.10 → 2874.74] prayer
[2874.74 → 2876.14] basically
[2876.14 → 2876.64] we need
[2876.64 → 2876.98] to begin
[2876.98 → 2877.70] by saying
[2877.70 → 2878.74] Lord
[2878.74 → 2878.80] Lord
[2878.80 → 2880.26] please work
[2880.26 → 2882.14] you are
[2882.14 → 2883.16] the one
[2883.16 → 2883.76] who promises
[2883.76 → 2884.10] that you
[2884.10 → 2884.70] call people
[2884.70 → 2885.34] to yourself
[2885.34 → 2886.42] and we
[2886.42 → 2886.84] need you
[2886.84 → 2887.22] to do
[2887.22 → 2887.72] that right
[2887.72 → 2888.08] now
[2888.08 → 2889.06] do your
[2889.06 → 2889.50] thing
[2889.50 → 2890.14] you're
[2890.14 → 2890.68] the God
[2890.68 → 2891.42] of
[2891.42 → 2892.20] of all
[2892.20 → 2892.62] people
[2892.62 → 2893.22] you can
[2893.22 → 2893.78] call people
[2893.78 → 2894.46] to yourself
[2894.46 → 2895.46] so it's
[2895.46 → 2896.20] very simple
[2896.20 → 2896.66] and very
[2896.66 → 2897.08] beautiful
[2897.08 → 2899.14] and notice
[2899.14 → 2899.76] also Paul
[2899.76 → 2900.48] doesn't say
[2900.48 → 2901.12] just pray
[2901.12 → 2901.70] once
[2901.70 → 2902.42] like just
[2902.42 → 2902.82] to begin
[2902.82 → 2903.36] the process
[2903.36 → 2903.88] and then
[2903.88 → 2904.52] we take
[2904.52 → 2904.86] over
[2904.86 → 2906.42] he says
[2906.42 → 2907.20] devote
[2907.20 → 2907.72] yourselves
[2907.72 → 2908.24] to prayer
[2908.24 → 2909.58] he's saying
[2909.58 → 2910.68] give yourselves
[2910.68 → 2912.22] to prayer
[2912.22 → 2913.32] prayer that
[2913.32 → 2913.98] is so it's
[2913.98 → 2914.34] not only
[2914.34 → 2914.94] the beginning
[2914.94 → 2916.22] of evangelism
[2916.22 → 2917.14] but it's
[2917.14 → 2917.76] the entire
[2917.76 → 2918.52] process
[2918.52 → 2919.58] it's something
[2919.58 → 2920.12] that we need
[2920.12 → 2920.74] to continue
[2920.74 → 2921.16] to do
[2921.16 → 2921.94] and persist
[2921.94 → 2922.72] in doing
[2922.72 → 2923.58] praying
[2923.58 → 2924.84] that God
[2924.84 → 2925.44] would change
[2925.44 → 2926.02] the lives
[2926.02 → 2926.54] and hearts
[2926.54 → 2927.60] of those
[2927.60 → 2928.76] that we
[2928.76 → 2929.24] care about
[2929.24 → 2929.76] and that we
[2929.76 → 2930.18] want to
[2930.18 → 2930.50] come to
[2930.50 → 2930.96] know Jesus
[2930.96 → 2933.32] so you know
[2933.32 → 2933.78] there's a really
[2933.78 → 2934.28] easy way
[2934.28 → 2934.68] to apply
[2934.68 → 2935.10] this
[2935.10 → 2936.38] and that
[2936.38 → 2936.90] is to
[2936.90 → 2937.24] give
[2937.24 → 2937.92] ourselves
[2937.92 → 2938.68] to prayer
[2938.68 → 2939.54] for our
[2939.54 → 2940.24] non-Christian
[2940.24 → 2940.82] friends
[2940.82 → 2941.82] for family
[2941.82 → 2942.22] members
[2942.22 → 2942.70] and for
[2942.70 → 2943.20] co-workers
[2943.20 → 2944.28] pray for
[2944.28 → 2944.62] them by
[2944.62 → 2945.06] name
[2945.06 → 2946.28] pray for
[2946.28 → 2946.66] them on
[2946.66 → 2947.22] a regular
[2947.22 → 2947.98] basis
[2947.98 → 2948.88] and do
[2948.88 → 2949.46] not give
[2949.46 → 2949.76] up
[2949.76 → 2950.44] Paul says
[2950.44 → 2950.66] to be
[2950.66 → 2951.32] watchful
[2951.32 → 2951.70] in it
[2951.70 → 2952.56] that means
[2952.56 → 2953.56] to continue
[2953.56 → 2953.92] to do
[2953.92 → 2954.18] it's like
[2954.18 → 2954.56] a spiritual
[2954.56 → 2955.02] discipline
[2955.02 → 2955.44] that we
[2955.44 → 2955.68] do
[2955.68 → 2956.54] even when
[2956.54 → 2957.60] we feel
[2957.60 → 2958.02] tired
[2958.02 → 2958.66] when we
[2958.66 → 2958.98] feel like
[2958.98 → 2959.48] giving up
[2959.48 → 2959.74] but he
[2959.74 → 2960.00] says
[2960.00 → 2961.10] to be
[2961.10 → 2961.66] watchful
[2961.66 → 2962.12] in prayer
[2962.12 → 2963.88] so that's
[2963.88 → 2964.24] the first
[2964.24 → 2964.38] thing
[2964.38 → 2964.66] that Paul
[2964.66 → 2965.32] gives us
[2965.32 → 2965.74] and I
[2965.74 → 2965.98] think it's
[2965.98 → 2966.54] very helpful
[2966.54 → 2967.84] because we
[2967.84 → 2968.34] can start
[2968.34 → 2968.78] in many
[2968.78 → 2969.38] places
[2969.38 → 2969.94] besides
[2969.94 → 2970.42] prayer
[2970.42 → 2971.28] but Paul
[2971.28 → 2971.74] says where
[2971.74 → 2972.04] you need
[2972.04 → 2972.48] to begin
[2972.48 → 2973.04] and where
[2973.04 → 2973.28] you need
[2973.28 → 2973.50] to keep
[2973.50 → 2974.06] coming back
[2974.06 → 2975.00] to is
[2975.00 → 2975.42] prayer
[2975.42 → 2976.44] coming back
[2976.44 → 2976.96] to God's
[2976.96 → 2977.40] sovereignty
[2977.40 → 2978.68] because God
[2978.68 → 2979.48] is the
[2979.48 → 2980.32] great evangelist
[2980.32 → 2980.70] and we can
[2980.70 → 2981.36] rely on
[2981.36 → 2981.72] him
[2981.72 → 2984.52] now the
[2984.52 → 2985.36] second aspect
[2985.36 → 2985.92] of God's
[2985.92 → 2986.36] sovereignty
[2986.36 → 2987.16] is God's
[2987.16 → 2987.48] word
[2987.48 → 2989.32] God's word
[2989.32 → 2990.06] is what
[2990.06 → 2990.84] is most
[2990.84 → 2991.44] important
[2991.44 → 2992.86] in evangelism
[2992.86 → 2994.74] not our
[2994.74 → 2995.54] abilities
[2995.54 → 2996.38] not our
[2996.38 → 2997.56] cleverness
[2997.56 → 2998.60] our words
[2998.60 → 2999.34] our
[2999.34 → 3000.50] argumentation
[3000.50 → 3001.12] we're not
[3001.12 → 3001.58] called to be
[3001.58 → 3002.20] lawyers
[3002.20 → 3002.70] we're called
[3002.70 → 3003.12] to be
[3003.12 → 3003.86] witnesses
[3003.86 → 3004.78] and the
[3004.78 → 3005.06] witness
[3005.06 → 3005.60] is centred
[3005.60 → 3006.08] on
[3006.08 → 3006.94] God's
[3006.94 → 3007.12] word
[3007.12 → 3007.48] we see
[3007.48 → 3007.84] that here
[3007.84 → 3008.18] in verse
[3008.18 → 3008.56] three
[3008.56 → 3010.22] verse
[3010.22 → 3010.64] three
[3010.64 → 3011.68] Paul says
[3011.68 → 3012.70] at the same
[3012.70 → 3013.38] time pray
[3013.38 → 3014.50] also for us
[3014.50 → 3015.18] that God
[3015.18 → 3015.66] may open
[3015.66 → 3016.04] to us
[3016.04 → 3016.48] a door
[3016.48 → 3017.18] for the
[3017.18 → 3017.46] word
[3017.46 → 3018.96] so Paul
[3018.96 → 3019.40] is asking
[3019.40 → 3019.92] the Colossians
[3019.92 → 3020.46] to pray
[3020.46 → 3021.22] and specifically
[3021.22 → 3021.94] he's asking
[3021.94 → 3022.58] them to pray
[3022.58 → 3023.00] that God
[3023.00 → 3023.36] would open
[3023.36 → 3023.80] a door
[3023.80 → 3025.28] but notice
[3025.28 → 3026.10] when we often
[3026.10 → 3026.62] pray about
[3026.62 → 3027.16] opening a
[3027.16 → 3027.44] door
[3027.44 → 3027.90] what do we
[3027.90 → 3028.36] think about
[3028.36 → 3029.80] well you know
[3029.80 → 3030.42] for those of you
[3030.42 → 3030.78] who are here
[3030.78 → 3031.42] we came through
[3031.42 → 3032.10] several doors
[3032.10 → 3032.76] to get here
[3032.76 → 3034.14] we think about
[3034.14 → 3034.74] us going
[3034.74 → 3035.14] through the
[3035.14 → 3035.48] door
[3035.48 → 3036.36] but notice
[3036.36 → 3036.70] what the
[3036.70 → 3037.34] door's for
[3037.34 → 3038.16] he wants
[3038.16 → 3038.50] an open
[3038.50 → 3038.88] door
[3038.88 → 3039.22] but the
[3039.22 → 3039.76] open door
[3039.76 → 3040.06] is not
[3040.06 → 3040.70] for him
[3040.70 → 3041.74] it's for
[3041.74 → 3042.08] God's
[3042.08 → 3042.38] word
[3042.38 → 3044.42] but Paul
[3044.42 → 3045.36] understands
[3045.36 → 3046.04] that yes
[3046.04 → 3046.72] he has a
[3046.72 → 3047.52] role to play
[3047.52 → 3048.92] but he
[3048.92 → 3049.52] removes
[3049.52 → 3050.06] himself
[3050.06 → 3050.78] from the
[3050.78 → 3051.30] centre
[3051.30 → 3051.86] of this
[3051.86 → 3052.26] entire
[3052.26 → 3052.62] thing
[3052.62 → 3053.00] that God
[3053.00 → 3053.60] is doing
[3053.60 → 3054.94] because ultimately
[3054.94 → 3056.04] what needs
[3056.04 → 3056.46] to come
[3056.46 → 3057.20] onto the
[3057.20 → 3058.26] centre stage
[3058.26 → 3058.84] the most
[3058.84 → 3059.68] important thing
[3059.68 → 3060.96] is God's
[3060.96 → 3061.40] word
[3061.40 → 3062.04] because God's
[3062.04 → 3062.40] word
[3062.40 → 3063.14] has the
[3063.14 → 3063.56] power
[3063.56 → 3064.94] to change
[3064.94 → 3065.44] hearts
[3065.44 → 3066.68] so he
[3066.68 → 3067.30] prays
[3067.30 → 3068.74] for a
[3068.74 → 3069.18] door
[3069.18 → 3069.54] for the
[3069.54 → 3070.00] word
[3070.00 → 3070.50] to go
[3070.50 → 3070.74] through
[3070.74 → 3071.32] the word
[3071.32 → 3071.58] that would
[3071.58 → 3072.22] go out
[3072.22 → 3072.70] into the
[3072.70 → 3073.06] world
[3073.06 → 3074.68] then Paul
[3074.68 → 3075.36] goes on
[3075.36 → 3075.72] in verse
[3075.72 → 3076.08] three
[3076.08 → 3076.70] to say
[3076.70 → 3077.22] this
[3077.22 → 3079.28] so that
[3079.28 → 3079.92] we may
[3079.92 → 3080.38] proclaim
[3080.38 → 3080.96] the mystery
[3080.96 → 3081.60] of Christ
[3081.60 → 3082.80] for which
[3082.80 → 3083.42] I am
[3083.42 → 3084.38] in chains
[3084.38 → 3085.56] okay so
[3085.56 → 3086.16] notice that
[3086.16 → 3086.64] last part
[3086.64 → 3087.08] for which
[3087.08 → 3087.38] I am
[3087.38 → 3087.88] in chains
[3087.88 → 3089.08] so Paul
[3089.08 → 3089.50] has this
[3089.50 → 3089.94] amazing
[3089.94 → 3090.34] sense
[3090.34 → 3091.02] of dramatic
[3091.02 → 3091.52] timing
[3091.52 → 3092.76] because
[3092.76 → 3093.70] in Paul's
[3093.70 → 3094.44] other letters
[3094.44 → 3095.68] he's often
[3095.68 → 3096.22] writing from
[3096.22 → 3096.52] jail
[3096.52 → 3097.02] and so he
[3097.02 → 3097.68] might begin
[3097.68 → 3098.18] a letter
[3098.18 → 3098.76] right at the
[3098.76 → 3099.16] beginning
[3099.16 → 3099.80] saying you
[3099.80 → 3100.16] know I
[3100.16 → 3100.50] am in
[3100.50 → 3100.86] chains
[3100.86 → 3101.34] I'm in
[3101.34 → 3101.64] prison
[3101.64 → 3103.04] sometimes
[3103.04 → 3103.62] like in
[3103.62 → 3104.22] Ephesians
[3104.22 → 3104.76] we see
[3104.76 → 3105.00] it in
[3105.00 → 3105.48] the middle
[3105.48 → 3105.84] of the
[3105.84 → 3106.12] letter
[3106.12 → 3106.48] and he
[3106.48 → 3106.96] uses it
[3106.96 → 3107.34] to make
[3107.34 → 3107.82] this very
[3107.82 → 3108.48] complex
[3108.48 → 3109.70] theological
[3109.70 → 3110.38] point
[3110.38 → 3111.06] that he's
[3111.06 → 3111.36] trying to
[3111.36 → 3111.66] make
[3111.66 → 3113.72] but here
[3113.72 → 3114.72] Paul waits
[3114.72 → 3115.14] until the
[3115.14 → 3115.96] very end
[3115.96 → 3116.44] of the
[3116.44 → 3116.72] letter
[3116.72 → 3117.08] of the
[3117.08 → 3117.62] Colossians
[3117.62 → 3118.32] this is
[3118.32 → 3118.70] right at
[3118.70 → 3119.18] the end
[3119.18 → 3120.88] where he
[3120.88 → 3121.38] says
[3121.38 → 3122.30] oh by
[3122.30 → 3122.94] the way
[3122.94 → 3123.46] I'm in
[3123.46 → 3123.90] prison
[3123.90 → 3124.40] as I'm
[3124.40 → 3124.66] writing
[3124.66 → 3125.24] to you
[3125.24 → 3126.70] so the
[3126.70 → 3127.08] question
[3127.08 → 3127.68] is
[3127.68 → 3128.34] why
[3128.34 → 3129.64] is Paul
[3129.64 → 3130.26] here
[3130.26 → 3131.20] putting
[3131.20 → 3131.44] this
[3131.44 → 3131.68] at the
[3131.68 → 3131.88] very
[3131.88 → 3132.10] end
[3132.10 → 3132.30] of the
[3132.30 → 3132.56] letter
[3132.56 → 3133.98] and I
[3133.98 → 3134.16] think
[3134.16 → 3134.34] it's
[3134.34 → 3134.60] to make
[3134.60 → 3135.10] a point
[3135.10 → 3136.52] he doesn't
[3136.52 → 3136.84] want to
[3136.84 → 3137.40] talk about
[3137.40 → 3137.62] his
[3137.62 → 3138.40] imprisonment
[3138.40 → 3138.88] until the
[3138.88 → 3139.34] moment
[3139.34 → 3140.04] that he's
[3140.04 → 3140.22] going to
[3140.22 → 3140.64] talk about
[3140.64 → 3141.20] witness
[3141.20 → 3142.76] in order
[3142.76 → 3143.14] to make
[3143.14 → 3143.78] a contrast
[3143.78 → 3144.32] between
[3144.32 → 3145.22] his chains
[3145.22 → 3146.14] his imprisonment
[3146.14 → 3146.82] and the
[3146.82 → 3147.30] gospel
[3147.30 → 3148.20] which can
[3148.20 → 3148.72] never be
[3148.72 → 3149.04] chained
[3149.04 → 3149.32] and can
[3149.32 → 3149.76] never be
[3149.76 → 3150.20] imprisoned
[3150.20 → 3151.72] Paul is
[3151.72 → 3152.40] saying I'm
[3152.40 → 3152.92] here in
[3152.92 → 3153.48] chains
[3153.48 → 3154.16] but the
[3154.16 → 3154.54] gospel
[3154.54 → 3155.44] cannot be
[3155.44 → 3155.84] chained
[3155.84 → 3156.56] the gospel
[3156.56 → 3157.04] can never
[3157.04 → 3157.64] be chained
[3157.64 → 3159.34] you know
[3159.34 → 3159.88] and we
[3159.88 → 3160.46] often
[3160.46 → 3161.50] are chained
[3161.50 → 3162.72] by our
[3162.72 → 3163.48] circumstances
[3163.48 → 3164.88] sometimes
[3164.88 → 3165.52] we are
[3165.52 → 3166.18] chained
[3166.18 → 3167.34] by our
[3167.34 → 3167.92] weaknesses
[3167.92 → 3169.22] you know
[3169.22 → 3169.76] maybe we
[3169.76 → 3170.24] don't think
[3170.24 → 3170.62] we know
[3170.62 → 3171.22] enough
[3171.22 → 3171.54] or know
[3171.54 → 3171.94] how to
[3171.94 → 3172.22] explain
[3172.22 → 3172.74] the gospel
[3172.74 → 3173.66] you know
[3173.66 → 3174.06] maybe when
[3174.06 → 3174.34] it comes
[3174.34 → 3174.62] to our
[3174.62 → 3175.18] family
[3175.18 → 3176.14] or friends
[3176.14 → 3176.34] who have
[3176.34 → 3176.76] known us
[3176.76 → 3177.16] for a long
[3177.16 → 3177.62] time
[3177.62 → 3177.86] and they
[3177.86 → 3178.24] know how
[3178.24 → 3178.68] we used
[3178.68 → 3179.10] to be
[3179.10 → 3179.38] and all
[3179.38 → 3180.32] the stupid
[3180.32 → 3180.80] things
[3180.80 → 3181.10] we've
[3181.10 → 3181.42] done
[3181.42 → 3182.40] we think
[3182.40 → 3182.72] that they
[3182.72 → 3183.10] could never
[3183.10 → 3183.64] hear the
[3183.64 → 3184.02] gospel
[3184.02 → 3185.22] from us
[3185.22 → 3186.16] you know
[3186.16 → 3186.52] we have
[3186.52 → 3186.86] all of
[3186.86 → 3187.04] these
[3187.04 → 3187.28] things
[3187.28 → 3187.58] that we
[3187.58 → 3187.72] are
[3187.72 → 3188.24] chained
[3188.24 → 3188.66] by
[3188.66 → 3190.00] but Paul
[3190.00 → 3190.50] is telling
[3190.50 → 3190.80] us that
[3190.80 → 3191.26] the gospel
[3191.26 → 3191.64] is not
[3191.64 → 3192.00] chained
[3192.00 → 3192.78] the gospel
[3192.78 → 3193.54] is free
[3193.54 → 3194.28] the gospel
[3194.28 → 3195.24] is powerful
[3195.24 → 3197.02] and that's
[3197.02 → 3197.36] why he
[3197.36 → 3197.78] starts with
[3197.78 → 3198.16] prayer
[3198.16 → 3199.38] because of
[3199.38 → 3199.70] what is
[3199.70 → 3200.04] prayer
[3200.04 → 3200.38] but the
[3200.38 → 3200.82] acknowledgement
[3200.82 → 3201.48] of our
[3201.48 → 3202.28] insufficiency
[3202.28 → 3203.18] and our
[3203.18 → 3203.58] desperate
[3203.58 → 3204.38] need for
[3204.38 → 3204.84] God's
[3204.84 → 3205.20] spirit
[3205.20 → 3205.74] to work
[3205.74 → 3206.20] in us
[3206.20 → 3206.66] and through
[3206.66 → 3206.88] us
[3206.88 → 3207.14] to do
[3207.14 → 3207.40] God's
[3207.40 → 3207.74] work
[3207.74 → 3209.30] because we
[3209.30 → 3210.04] are weak
[3210.04 → 3211.12] but God
[3211.12 → 3211.72] is powerful
[3211.72 → 3213.04] and that is
[3213.04 → 3213.48] freeing
[3213.48 → 3213.76] that is
[3213.76 → 3214.14] freeing to
[3214.14 → 3214.36] us
[3214.36 → 3214.68] when we
[3214.68 → 3215.30] think about
[3215.30 → 3217.18] what our
[3217.18 → 3218.42] responsibility
[3218.42 → 3219.24] is and our
[3219.24 → 3220.02] call and our
[3220.02 → 3220.88] identity to be
[3220.88 → 3221.32] witnesses
[3221.32 → 3223.72] because ultimately
[3223.72 → 3224.56] the power of the
[3224.56 → 3225.24] gospel is not
[3225.24 → 3226.18] dependent on my
[3226.18 → 3226.60] character
[3226.60 → 3227.66] it's not
[3227.66 → 3228.44] dependent on my
[3228.44 → 3229.54] arguments or my
[3229.54 → 3230.10] personality
[3230.10 → 3231.52] but the power
[3231.52 → 3232.32] of God is the
[3232.32 → 3233.02] word of God
[3233.02 → 3235.10] and that gives us
[3235.10 → 3236.42] confidence to talk
[3236.42 → 3237.02] about Jesus
[3237.02 → 3239.46] it's that God
[3239.46 → 3240.72] can take us
[3240.72 → 3241.38] as imperfect
[3241.38 → 3241.86] people
[3241.86 → 3243.64] and use us
[3243.64 → 3244.26] to declare
[3244.26 → 3244.28] to declare
[3244.28 → 3244.76] to the
[3244.76 → 3245.10] world
[3245.10 → 3246.02] a perfect
[3246.02 → 3246.62] gospel
[3246.62 → 3248.04] and that
[3248.04 → 3248.44] brings these
[3248.44 → 3248.82] two things
[3248.82 → 3249.22] together
[3249.22 → 3249.80] of God's
[3249.80 → 3250.80] sovereignty
[3250.80 → 3252.48] with prayer
[3252.48 → 3253.08] starts with prayer
[3253.08 → 3253.64] because God
[3253.64 → 3253.94] is the one
[3253.94 → 3254.22] who's able
[3254.22 → 3254.64] to work
[3254.64 → 3255.36] and it is
[3255.36 → 3255.98] God's word
[3255.98 → 3256.58] itself
[3256.58 → 3257.42] that is
[3257.42 → 3258.06] the one
[3258.06 → 3258.70] that goes
[3258.70 → 3259.50] forth freely
[3259.50 → 3260.78] goes forward
[3260.78 → 3261.54] out of these
[3261.54 → 3261.92] doors
[3261.92 → 3262.96] into other
[3262.96 → 3263.30] doors
[3263.30 → 3263.80] into the doors
[3263.80 → 3264.08] of our
[3264.08 → 3264.44] hearts
[3264.44 → 3264.90] into the doors
[3264.90 → 3265.40] of people's
[3265.40 → 3265.70] hearts
[3265.70 → 3266.76] and is able
[3266.76 → 3267.56] to powerfully
[3267.56 → 3267.96] work
[3267.96 → 3272.20] and this
[3272.20 → 3272.98] again gives
[3272.98 → 3273.58] us enormous
[3273.58 → 3274.28] freedom
[3274.28 → 3275.32] to live out
[3275.32 → 3275.82] our identity
[3275.82 → 3276.20] and our
[3276.20 → 3276.90] calling
[3276.90 → 3277.72] to be
[3277.72 → 3278.12] witnesses
[3278.12 → 3279.34] so that
[3279.34 → 3279.70] brings us
[3279.70 → 3279.98] to our
[3279.98 → 3280.60] responsibility
[3280.60 → 3282.74] the first
[3282.74 → 3283.32] thing is that
[3283.32 → 3284.04] we believe
[3284.04 → 3284.58] in and we
[3284.58 → 3285.22] cling to
[3285.22 → 3285.56] God's
[3285.56 → 3286.14] responsibility
[3286.14 → 3287.68] and the
[3287.68 → 3288.40] second thing
[3288.40 → 3288.74] that Paul
[3288.74 → 3289.40] talks about
[3289.40 → 3289.88] here then
[3289.88 → 3291.08] is our
[3291.08 → 3291.78] responsibility
[3291.78 → 3292.18] sorry we
[3292.18 → 3292.42] cling to
[3292.42 → 3292.64] God's
[3292.64 → 3293.06] sovereignty
[3293.06 → 3294.04] then he
[3294.04 → 3294.40] turns to
[3294.40 → 3294.54] our
[3294.54 → 3295.20] responsibility
[3295.20 → 3297.44] so now
[3297.44 → 3297.80] what I
[3297.80 → 3298.08] want to
[3298.08 → 3298.62] do here
[3298.62 → 3300.04] is what
[3300.04 → 3300.32] I think
[3300.32 → 3301.18] Paul does
[3301.18 → 3302.70] and hopefully
[3302.70 → 3303.60] this will be
[3303.60 → 3304.28] life-giving as
[3304.28 → 3304.56] well
[3304.56 → 3305.76] because it's
[3305.76 → 3306.80] very clear
[3306.80 → 3307.80] Paul draws
[3307.80 → 3308.52] a distinction
[3308.52 → 3309.18] between what
[3309.18 → 3309.86] he expects
[3309.86 → 3310.70] of himself
[3310.70 → 3312.02] as an
[3312.02 → 3312.42] apostle
[3312.42 → 3312.94] and a
[3312.94 → 3313.42] pastor
[3313.42 → 3314.66] and what
[3314.66 → 3315.38] he expects
[3315.38 → 3315.68] on the
[3315.68 → 3316.20] other hand
[3316.20 → 3316.68] of the
[3316.68 → 3317.28] Colossians
[3317.28 → 3317.82] and of us
[3317.82 → 3318.48] the congregation
[3318.48 → 3320.54] so first
[3320.54 → 3321.12] then what
[3321.12 → 3322.02] are pastors
[3322.02 → 3322.76] and church
[3322.76 → 3323.26] planters
[3323.26 → 3324.24] and missionaries
[3324.24 → 3324.62] and evangelists
[3324.62 → 3325.28] evangelists
[3325.28 → 3326.46] like Paul
[3326.46 → 3327.48] what are they
[3327.48 → 3327.98] to do
[3327.98 → 3329.48] he tells us
[3329.48 → 3330.16] in verse 4
[3330.16 → 3331.08] continuing on
[3331.08 → 3331.72] our passage
[3331.72 → 3332.88] he says
[3332.88 → 3334.20] pray that I
[3334.20 → 3335.16] may proclaim
[3335.16 → 3336.14] it
[3336.14 → 3336.70] that is
[3336.70 → 3337.06] the mystery
[3337.06 → 3337.58] of Christ
[3337.58 → 3338.64] clearly
[3338.64 → 3339.58] as I should
[3339.58 → 3341.02] okay so
[3341.02 → 3341.76] they are
[3341.76 → 3342.36] to do what
[3342.36 → 3343.90] proclaim
[3343.90 → 3345.52] in other words
[3345.52 → 3346.88] they are to
[3346.88 → 3347.32] take the
[3347.32 → 3347.84] initiative
[3347.84 → 3348.24] in the
[3348.24 → 3348.80] conversation
[3348.80 → 3350.14] they are to
[3350.14 → 3351.06] proclaim the
[3351.06 → 3351.54] gospel
[3351.54 → 3353.02] to anyone
[3353.02 → 3353.46] who would
[3353.46 → 3353.84] listen
[3353.84 → 3354.98] and that's
[3354.98 → 3355.38] what Paul
[3355.38 → 3355.68] did
[3355.68 → 3356.66] he went
[3356.66 → 3357.00] on his
[3357.00 → 3357.34] missionary
[3357.34 → 3357.92] journeys
[3357.92 → 3358.80] he's going
[3358.80 → 3359.10] along
[3359.10 → 3359.68] he's planting
[3359.68 → 3360.20] churches
[3360.20 → 3361.42] he's standing
[3361.42 → 3361.86] up in the
[3361.86 → 3362.52] synagogues
[3362.52 → 3362.96] and teaching
[3362.96 → 3363.62] he's going
[3363.62 → 3364.06] to the
[3364.06 → 3364.50] streets
[3364.50 → 3365.62] he's proclaiming
[3365.62 → 3366.08] the gospel
[3366.08 → 3367.38] and then he
[3367.38 → 3368.34] establishes churches
[3368.34 → 3369.22] and he appoints
[3369.22 → 3369.86] elders and
[3369.86 → 3370.30] pastors
[3370.30 → 3371.80] in each
[3371.80 → 3372.46] church to
[3372.46 → 3373.50] continue the
[3373.50 → 3374.26] ministry of
[3374.26 → 3374.90] teaching and
[3374.90 → 3375.66] proclaiming the
[3375.66 → 3375.94] gospel
[3375.94 → 3377.98] that's why I'm
[3377.98 → 3378.42] standing here
[3378.42 → 3378.98] right now
[3378.98 → 3380.40] preaching to you
[3380.40 → 3380.98] because that
[3380.98 → 3381.58] is what
[3381.58 → 3382.12] pastors
[3382.12 → 3382.66] missionaries
[3382.66 → 3383.28] evangelists
[3383.28 → 3383.74] are to
[3383.74 → 3384.14] do
[3384.14 → 3385.20] we proclaim
[3385.20 → 3385.74] Christ
[3385.74 → 3387.28] now what
[3387.28 → 3387.70] about the
[3387.70 → 3388.32] congregation
[3388.32 → 3389.80] what are
[3389.80 → 3390.50] you to
[3390.50 → 3390.84] do
[3390.84 → 3392.40] Paul says
[3392.40 → 3392.72] your
[3392.72 → 3393.48] responsibility
[3393.48 → 3395.04] is to
[3395.04 → 3395.52] answer
[3395.52 → 3396.82] not to
[3396.82 → 3397.52] proclaim
[3397.52 → 3398.86] right not
[3398.86 → 3399.18] to take
[3399.18 → 3399.92] the initiative
[3399.92 → 3401.36] but to
[3401.36 → 3402.08] respond
[3402.08 → 3403.40] and friends
[3403.40 → 3403.96] that makes
[3403.96 → 3404.72] all the
[3404.72 → 3405.28] difference
[3405.28 → 3405.72] in the
[3405.72 → 3406.12] world
[3406.12 → 3406.96] right that
[3406.96 → 3407.66] just changes
[3407.66 → 3408.38] everything
[3408.38 → 3408.80] when it
[3408.80 → 3409.64] comes to
[3409.64 → 3411.20] evangelism
[3411.20 → 3411.86] and being
[3411.86 → 3412.40] a witness
[3412.40 → 3413.70] it means
[3413.70 → 3414.08] that you
[3414.08 → 3414.44] can let
[3414.44 → 3415.10] go of
[3415.10 → 3415.74] the guilt
[3415.74 → 3416.34] of thinking
[3416.34 → 3416.72] you need
[3416.72 → 3416.92] to be
[3416.92 → 3417.46] talking about
[3417.46 → 3417.74] Jesus
[3417.74 → 3418.22] in every
[3418.22 → 3418.74] interaction
[3418.74 → 3419.04] that you
[3419.04 → 3419.48] have
[3419.48 → 3421.20] right some
[3421.20 → 3421.42] of you
[3421.42 → 3421.74] might be
[3421.74 → 3422.20] thinking
[3422.20 → 3423.02] hearing this
[3423.02 → 3423.74] well okay
[3423.74 → 3425.28] I feel a little
[3425.28 → 3425.76] bit off the
[3425.76 → 3426.28] hook now
[3426.28 → 3426.90] I feel a little
[3426.90 → 3427.36] bit like I
[3427.36 → 3427.62] don't need
[3427.62 → 3427.86] to feel
[3427.86 → 3428.26] guilty
[3428.26 → 3429.48] but doesn't
[3429.48 → 3430.06] that sound
[3430.06 → 3430.70] too passive
[3430.70 → 3432.08] like isn't
[3432.08 → 3432.54] that kind
[3432.54 → 3433.50] of retreating
[3433.50 → 3433.92] from our
[3433.92 → 3434.66] responsibilities
[3434.66 → 3437.06] but notice
[3437.06 → 3437.68] that Paul
[3437.68 → 3438.24] what he's
[3438.24 → 3438.66] saying here
[3438.66 → 3439.22] is identical
[3439.22 → 3439.74] to what
[3439.74 → 3440.64] Peter says
[3440.64 → 3442.16] in 1 Peter 3
[3442.16 → 3442.94] so what does
[3442.94 → 3443.76] 1 Peter 3
[3443.76 → 3444.14] say
[3444.14 → 3445.66] always be
[3445.66 → 3446.20] prepared
[3446.20 → 3447.00] to give
[3447.00 → 3448.16] an answer
[3448.16 → 3448.98] to everyone
[3448.98 → 3449.60] who asks
[3449.60 → 3450.00] you to give
[3450.00 → 3450.38] the reason
[3450.38 → 3450.82] for the hope
[3450.82 → 3451.04] that you
[3451.04 → 3451.50] have
[3451.50 → 3452.68] but do
[3452.68 → 3453.06] this with
[3453.06 → 3453.46] gentleness
[3453.46 → 3454.24] and respect
[3454.24 → 3455.84] he says
[3455.84 → 3456.48] be ready
[3456.48 → 3457.58] to give
[3457.58 → 3458.26] an answer
[3458.26 → 3459.28] to give
[3459.28 → 3460.14] a response
[3460.14 → 3461.80] right
[3461.80 → 3462.62] so I hope
[3462.62 → 3463.18] that this
[3463.18 → 3463.76] can really
[3463.76 → 3464.66] sink in
[3464.66 → 3465.74] that you
[3465.74 → 3466.38] do not
[3466.38 → 3467.14] have to
[3467.14 → 3467.64] force
[3467.64 → 3468.50] a conversation
[3468.50 → 3470.12] about Jesus
[3470.12 → 3470.66] to happen
[3470.66 → 3471.52] right
[3471.52 → 3471.94] you do not
[3471.94 → 3472.32] have to
[3472.32 → 3473.46] constantly
[3473.46 → 3474.26] steer
[3474.26 → 3474.98] discussions
[3474.98 → 3475.52] to the
[3475.52 → 3475.88] gospel
[3475.88 → 3476.88] right
[3476.88 → 3477.28] like if
[3477.28 → 3477.48] you're
[3477.48 → 3477.88] sitting
[3477.88 → 3478.20] with a
[3478.20 → 3478.58] friend
[3478.58 → 3479.06] and your
[3479.06 → 3479.24] friend
[3479.24 → 3479.70] takes a
[3479.70 → 3480.00] drink of
[3480.00 → 3480.32] water
[3480.32 → 3480.98] you don't
[3480.98 → 3481.36] have to
[3481.36 → 3481.78] say
[3481.78 → 3482.62] hey
[3482.62 → 3483.02] did you
[3483.02 → 3483.40] know
[3483.40 → 3484.08] Jesus
[3484.08 → 3484.46] is the
[3484.46 → 3484.64] living
[3484.64 → 3485.00] water
[3485.00 → 3485.82] did you
[3485.82 → 3485.92] know
[3485.92 → 3486.24] that Jesus
[3486.24 → 3486.58] walked
[3486.58 → 3487.02] on water
[3487.02 → 3488.18] I've
[3488.18 → 3488.40] actually
[3488.40 → 3488.76] said that
[3488.76 → 3489.06] before
[3489.06 → 3489.30] that's
[3489.30 → 3489.52] why I'm
[3489.52 → 3489.66] using
[3489.66 → 3489.98] this as
[3489.98 → 3490.08] an
[3490.08 → 3490.38] example
[3490.38 → 3491.16] I don't
[3491.16 → 3491.50] recommend
[3491.50 → 3491.78] it
[3491.78 → 3493.06] and you
[3493.06 → 3493.30] know
[3493.30 → 3493.82] you shouldn't
[3493.82 → 3494.28] do that
[3494.28 → 3494.54] you're
[3494.54 → 3494.80] like
[3494.80 → 3495.66] I'm not
[3495.66 → 3495.86] going to
[3495.86 → 3496.40] do that
[3496.40 → 3496.92] right
[3496.92 → 3497.22] that would
[3497.22 → 3497.60] be so
[3497.60 → 3498.00] weird
[3498.00 → 3498.48] that would
[3498.48 → 3498.80] be so
[3498.80 → 3499.50] unhelpful
[3499.50 → 3500.44] I don't
[3500.44 → 3500.62] want to
[3500.62 → 3500.88] be that
[3500.88 → 3501.18] person
[3501.18 → 3501.40] who's
[3501.40 → 3501.62] always
[3501.62 → 3501.82] like
[3501.82 → 3502.36] killing
[3502.36 → 3502.58] the
[3502.58 → 3503.18] conversation
[3503.18 → 3503.76] and creating
[3503.76 → 3504.16] awkward
[3504.16 → 3504.72] moments
[3504.72 → 3505.68] and you
[3505.68 → 3505.92] don't
[3505.92 → 3506.46] have to
[3506.46 → 3507.70] it doesn't
[3507.70 → 3508.34] mean also
[3508.34 → 3508.74] that you
[3508.74 → 3509.34] are ashamed
[3509.34 → 3509.66] of the
[3509.66 → 3509.96] gospel
[3509.96 → 3510.34] if you
[3510.34 → 3510.54] don't
[3510.54 → 3510.98] do that
[3510.98 → 3511.60] that's
[3511.60 → 3512.16] not what
[3512.16 → 3512.40] your
[3512.40 → 3512.86] responsibility
[3512.86 → 3513.42] is
[3513.42 → 3514.78] okay
[3514.78 → 3516.54] but what
[3516.54 → 3517.26] Paul is
[3517.26 → 3517.80] saying
[3517.80 → 3518.48] in that
[3518.48 → 3518.96] what you
[3518.96 → 3519.44] need to
[3519.44 → 3519.78] do
[3519.78 → 3520.64] is you
[3520.64 → 3520.90] need to
[3520.90 → 3521.44] be ready
[3521.44 → 3522.38] to respond
[3522.38 → 3522.78] to these
[3522.78 → 3523.30] questions
[3523.30 → 3523.60] that are
[3523.60 → 3523.74] going to
[3523.74 → 3524.22] be asked
[3524.22 → 3525.38] and that
[3525.38 → 3525.68] is a
[3525.68 → 3525.92] totally
[3525.92 → 3526.20] different
[3526.20 → 3526.76] situation
[3526.76 → 3528.08] like being
[3528.08 → 3528.54] on the
[3528.54 → 3528.94] hook
[3528.94 → 3530.22] to have
[3530.22 → 3531.08] to force
[3531.08 → 3531.88] something
[3531.88 → 3532.40] to happen
[3532.40 → 3532.90] is very
[3532.90 → 3533.46] different
[3533.46 → 3533.92] from being
[3533.92 → 3534.48] responsible
[3534.48 → 3534.90] to give
[3534.90 → 3535.50] an answer
[3535.50 → 3536.50] and to be
[3536.50 → 3536.90] prepared
[3536.90 → 3537.66] to respond
[3537.66 → 3538.60] when you
[3538.60 → 3539.26] are asked
[3539.26 → 3541.14] so Paul
[3541.14 → 3541.68] wants the
[3541.68 → 3542.20] Colossians
[3542.20 → 3542.64] and us
[3542.64 → 3543.22] to see
[3543.22 → 3543.58] our
[3543.58 → 3544.26] responsibility
[3544.26 → 3545.46] in a
[3545.46 → 3545.96] much more
[3545.96 → 3546.62] promising
[3546.62 → 3547.12] light
[3547.12 → 3548.26] and frankly
[3548.26 → 3548.88] a much
[3548.88 → 3549.34] more
[3549.34 → 3550.36] reasonable
[3550.36 → 3551.98] and
[3551.98 → 3553.06] like this
[3553.06 → 3553.28] is a
[3553.28 → 3553.68] reality
[3553.68 → 3554.16] this is
[3554.16 → 3554.48] what we
[3554.48 → 3554.92] live
[3554.92 → 3555.44] in this
[3555.44 → 3555.72] world
[3555.72 → 3556.30] like that
[3556.30 → 3557.96] so our
[3557.96 → 3558.76] privilege
[3558.76 → 3559.98] as Christians
[3559.98 → 3561.88] simply put
[3561.88 → 3562.76] is to
[3562.76 → 3563.06] answer
[3563.06 → 3563.56] everyone
[3563.56 → 3565.82] that is
[3565.82 → 3566.32] to say
[3566.32 → 3567.36] that we
[3567.36 → 3567.90] are simply
[3567.90 → 3568.66] to accept
[3568.66 → 3569.30] openings
[3569.30 → 3569.78] as they
[3569.78 → 3570.18] come
[3570.18 → 3571.64] rather than
[3571.64 → 3572.10] make them
[3572.10 → 3573.02] because we
[3573.02 → 3573.50] believe
[3573.50 → 3574.54] and trust
[3574.54 → 3575.64] in God's
[3575.64 → 3576.10] sovereignty
[3576.10 → 3578.40] and the
[3578.40 → 3579.14] thing is
[3579.14 → 3579.62] Paul
[3579.62 → 3580.68] is assuming
[3580.68 → 3581.56] that plenty
[3581.56 → 3582.34] of opportunities
[3582.34 → 3582.72] are going
[3582.72 → 3583.04] to come
[3583.04 → 3584.16] right
[3584.16 → 3584.66] he's saying
[3584.66 → 3584.96] that there
[3584.96 → 3585.26] will be
[3585.26 → 3585.88] frequent
[3585.88 → 3586.64] chances
[3586.64 → 3587.74] to be
[3587.74 → 3588.44] a witness
[3588.44 → 3589.08] to Jesus
[3589.08 → 3589.70] if you
[3589.70 → 3590.72] are involved
[3590.72 → 3591.54] in the
[3591.54 → 3592.46] lives of
[3592.46 → 3593.28] people who
[3593.28 → 3593.58] do not
[3593.58 → 3593.86] even know
[3593.86 → 3594.18] Jesus
[3594.18 → 3594.80] so that's
[3594.80 → 3595.16] the first
[3595.16 → 3595.50] step
[3595.50 → 3596.96] do you
[3596.96 → 3597.18] know
[3597.18 → 3597.86] non-Christians
[3597.86 → 3598.38] are you
[3598.38 → 3598.70] in their
[3598.70 → 3599.18] lives
[3599.18 → 3599.72] do they
[3599.72 → 3600.28] know you
[3600.28 → 3600.54] do you
[3600.54 → 3600.88] know their
[3600.88 → 3601.46] questions
[3601.46 → 3602.58] their stories
[3602.58 → 3603.52] the things
[3603.52 → 3603.96] they wrestle
[3603.96 → 3604.32] with
[3604.32 → 3604.70] we need
[3604.70 → 3605.12] to be
[3605.12 → 3605.68] involved
[3605.68 → 3605.94] with
[3605.94 → 3606.72] non-Christians
[3606.72 → 3608.04] and then
[3608.04 → 3608.60] when people
[3608.60 → 3609.50] do ask
[3609.50 → 3610.14] questions
[3610.14 → 3611.64] how should
[3611.64 → 3612.26] we respond
[3612.26 → 3614.16] well Paul
[3614.16 → 3614.96] says a couple
[3614.96 → 3615.36] of things
[3615.36 → 3615.64] here
[3615.64 → 3617.26] first he
[3617.26 → 3617.56] says in
[3617.56 → 3618.14] verse 5
[3618.14 → 3620.42] be wise
[3620.42 → 3621.30] in the way
[3621.30 → 3621.84] you act
[3621.84 → 3622.60] toward outsiders
[3622.60 → 3623.88] so what
[3623.88 → 3624.56] scripture calls
[3624.56 → 3624.90] us to
[3624.90 → 3625.34] is to be
[3625.34 → 3625.88] wise
[3625.88 → 3626.82] in the way
[3626.82 → 3627.16] that we
[3627.16 → 3627.66] act
[3627.66 → 3628.52] with those
[3628.52 → 3628.80] who do
[3628.80 → 3629.10] not know
[3629.10 → 3629.58] the faith
[3629.58 → 3631.12] and what
[3631.12 → 3631.64] he's talking
[3631.64 → 3632.16] about here
[3632.16 → 3632.90] is this
[3632.90 → 3633.70] living
[3633.70 → 3634.46] faithfully
[3634.46 → 3634.80] as a
[3634.80 → 3635.10] Christian
[3635.10 → 3635.66] wherever
[3635.66 → 3636.18] God
[3636.18 → 3636.40] has
[3636.40 → 3636.68] placed
[3636.68 → 3637.02] us
[3637.02 → 3637.82] you know
[3637.82 → 3638.46] with
[3638.46 → 3638.96] our
[3638.96 → 3639.50] families
[3639.50 → 3640.82] in our
[3640.82 → 3641.64] workplaces
[3641.64 → 3642.62] in our
[3642.62 → 3643.02] neighbourhoods
[3643.02 → 3643.34] in our
[3643.34 → 3643.70] schools
[3643.70 → 3644.14] just to
[3644.14 → 3644.30] live
[3644.30 → 3644.78] faithfully
[3644.78 → 3645.30] to honour
[3645.30 → 3645.76] God
[3645.76 → 3647.58] to honour
[3647.58 → 3648.04] him
[3648.04 → 3648.60] before
[3648.60 → 3649.28] a world
[3649.28 → 3649.66] that is
[3649.66 → 3650.18] watching
[3650.18 → 3651.16] and will
[3651.16 → 3651.38] take
[3651.38 → 3651.82] notice
[3651.82 → 3653.80] he then
[3653.80 → 3654.38] says
[3654.38 → 3655.34] in the
[3655.34 → 3655.66] rest of
[3655.66 → 3656.26] verse 5
[3656.26 → 3656.88] make the
[3656.88 → 3657.22] most of
[3657.22 → 3657.40] every
[3657.40 → 3658.00] opportunity
[3658.00 → 3659.52] so this
[3659.52 → 3659.92] phrase
[3659.92 → 3660.36] has its
[3660.36 → 3660.76] origin
[3660.76 → 3661.08] in the
[3661.08 → 3661.50] marketplace
[3661.50 → 3662.32] of Paul's
[3662.32 → 3662.52] day
[3662.52 → 3663.98] this idea
[3663.98 → 3664.72] the idea
[3664.72 → 3665.06] is this
[3665.06 → 3665.40] that you're
[3665.40 → 3665.58] in the
[3665.58 → 3666.04] marketplace
[3666.04 → 3667.14] you're
[3667.14 → 3667.50] shopping
[3667.50 → 3668.04] on Amazon
[3668.04 → 3668.90] you're
[3668.90 → 3669.22] shopping
[3669.22 → 3669.70] and you
[3669.70 → 3670.02] see a
[3670.02 → 3670.36] bargain
[3670.36 → 3671.12] or you
[3671.12 → 3671.36] get a
[3671.36 → 3671.80] Groupon
[3671.80 → 3672.14] coupon
[3672.14 → 3672.50] in the
[3672.50 → 3672.74] mail
[3672.74 → 3673.42] you see
[3673.42 → 3673.80] a bargain
[3673.80 → 3674.30] you say
[3674.30 → 3675.04] wow
[3675.04 → 3675.46] this is
[3675.46 → 3676.12] a great
[3676.12 → 3676.66] deal
[3676.66 → 3676.98] I've
[3676.98 → 3677.28] got to
[3677.28 → 3677.60] snap
[3677.60 → 3678.12] this up
[3678.12 → 3678.94] like this
[3678.94 → 3679.32] is not
[3679.32 → 3679.56] going to
[3679.56 → 3680.10] be like
[3680.10 → 3680.30] this
[3680.30 → 3680.66] forever
[3680.66 → 3681.24] I'm
[3681.24 → 3681.58] probably
[3681.58 → 3681.78] not
[3681.78 → 3681.90] going to
[3681.90 → 3682.06] be able
[3682.06 → 3682.28] to get
[3682.28 → 3682.46] this
[3682.46 → 3682.74] at this
[3682.74 → 3682.98] price
[3682.98 → 3683.32] again
[3683.32 → 3683.98] so I'm
[3683.98 → 3684.22] going to
[3684.22 → 3684.48] act
[3684.48 → 3685.10] now
[3685.10 → 3686.52] this
[3686.52 → 3686.96] is the
[3686.96 → 3687.24] idea
[3687.24 → 3687.60] that Paul
[3687.60 → 3687.92] is getting
[3687.92 → 3688.18] at
[3688.18 → 3689.82] so what
[3689.82 → 3690.10] Paul is
[3690.10 → 3690.28] saying
[3690.28 → 3690.50] is
[3690.50 → 3691.04] when those
[3691.04 → 3691.80] opportunities
[3691.80 → 3692.44] happen
[3692.44 → 3693.22] when the
[3693.22 → 3693.72] questions
[3693.72 → 3694.52] do come
[3694.52 → 3696.00] take them
[3696.00 → 3697.30] snap up
[3697.30 → 3698.00] the deal
[3698.00 → 3699.08] there's an
[3699.08 → 3699.74] opportunity
[3699.74 → 3700.24] to talk
[3700.24 → 3700.76] about Jesus
[3700.76 → 3701.72] or to share
[3701.72 → 3702.36] something about
[3702.36 → 3702.80] the hope
[3702.80 → 3703.30] you have
[3703.30 → 3704.00] there's some
[3704.00 → 3704.78] opening to
[3704.78 → 3705.32] talk about
[3705.32 → 3705.94] your relationship
[3705.94 → 3706.54] with God
[3706.54 → 3707.42] and these
[3707.42 → 3707.96] opportunities
[3707.96 → 3708.74] are so
[3708.74 → 3709.42] precious
[3709.42 → 3710.74] you didn't
[3710.74 → 3711.40] create them
[3711.40 → 3712.02] by trying to
[3712.02 → 3712.46] force the
[3712.46 → 3713.02] conversation
[3713.02 → 3713.64] in some
[3713.64 → 3714.00] awkward
[3714.00 → 3714.44] way
[3714.44 → 3715.20] but
[3715.20 → 3715.68] nevertheless
[3715.68 → 3716.14] God
[3716.14 → 3716.56] by his
[3716.56 → 3717.00] grace
[3717.00 → 3717.60] the
[3717.60 → 3718.12] opportunity
[3718.12 → 3718.52] is
[3718.52 → 3718.92] there
[3718.92 → 3720.06] so
[3720.06 → 3720.60] see
[3720.60 → 3720.94] how
[3720.94 → 3721.62] valuable
[3721.62 → 3722.26] that
[3722.26 → 3722.94] is
[3722.94 → 3724.12] see
[3724.12 → 3724.38] how
[3724.38 → 3725.12] fleeting
[3725.12 → 3725.50] it
[3725.50 → 3725.98] is
[3725.98 → 3726.52] because
[3726.52 → 3726.84] that
[3726.84 → 3727.46] opportunity
[3727.46 → 3727.98] isn't
[3727.98 → 3728.18] going to
[3728.18 → 3728.58] be there
[3728.58 → 3729.04] forever
[3729.04 → 3729.92] in a
[3729.92 → 3730.28] moment
[3730.28 → 3730.62] it's
[3730.62 → 3731.00] there
[3731.00 → 3732.12] then
[3732.12 → 3732.32] it's
[3732.32 → 3732.58] gone
[3732.58 → 3733.58] it's
[3733.58 → 3733.90] like
[3733.90 → 3734.42] on a
[3734.42 → 3734.70] cloudy
[3734.70 → 3735.22] day
[3735.22 → 3735.60] and the
[3735.60 → 3735.86] clouds
[3735.86 → 3736.10] kind
[3736.10 → 3736.22] of
[3736.22 → 3736.70] part
[3736.70 → 3737.30] and the
[3737.30 → 3737.62] sun
[3737.62 → 3737.82] just
[3737.82 → 3738.02] kind
[3738.02 → 3738.16] of
[3738.16 → 3738.60] shines
[3738.60 → 3739.00] through
[3739.00 → 3739.62] and it's
[3739.62 → 3739.86] there
[3739.86 → 3740.22] for a
[3740.22 → 3740.48] moment
[3740.48 → 3740.76] and you're
[3740.76 → 3740.92] like
[3740.92 → 3741.62] wow
[3741.62 → 3742.22] it's
[3742.22 → 3742.54] beautiful
[3742.54 → 3742.88] and then
[3742.88 → 3743.16] okay
[3743.16 → 3743.50] now it's
[3743.50 → 3743.78] cloudy
[3743.78 → 3744.14] again
[3744.14 → 3745.54] that's
[3745.54 → 3745.84] what it's
[3745.84 → 3746.18] like
[3746.18 → 3747.28] and so
[3747.28 → 3747.94] we need
[3747.94 → 3748.46] to be
[3748.46 → 3749.56] watchful
[3749.56 → 3750.12] in prayer
[3750.12 → 3750.70] for those
[3750.70 → 3751.32] opportunities
[3751.32 → 3751.88] praying
[3751.88 → 3752.26] for those
[3752.26 → 3752.80] opportunities
[3752.80 → 3754.04] and then
[3754.04 → 3754.50] be on the
[3754.50 → 3754.84] lookout
[3754.84 → 3755.40] for them
[3755.40 → 3756.08] to happen
[3756.08 → 3756.58] and then
[3756.58 → 3757.28] respond
[3757.28 → 3757.90] to them
[3757.90 → 3758.74] when they
[3758.74 → 3759.06] come
[3759.06 → 3762.30] that's
[3762.30 → 3762.52] what we
[3762.52 → 3762.76] do
[3762.76 → 3764.16] then in
[3764.16 → 3764.64] verse 6
[3764.64 → 3765.00] Paul
[3765.00 → 3765.88] elaborates
[3765.88 → 3766.12] a little
[3766.12 → 3766.58] bit more
[3766.58 → 3766.98] about the
[3766.98 → 3767.46] manner
[3767.46 → 3767.96] of our
[3767.96 → 3768.46] response
[3768.46 → 3769.06] he says
[3769.06 → 3769.84] not
[3769.84 → 3770.10] not only
[3770.10 → 3770.42] to see
[3770.42 → 3770.64] these
[3770.64 → 3770.84] things
[3770.84 → 3771.00] as
[3771.00 → 3771.52] valuable
[3771.52 → 3771.88] and
[3771.88 → 3772.52] fleeting
[3772.52 → 3773.14] but
[3773.14 → 3773.22] he
[3773.22 → 3773.40] says
[3773.40 → 3773.54] let
[3773.54 → 3773.66] your
[3773.66 → 3774.28] conversation
[3774.28 → 3774.66] always
[3774.66 → 3774.82] be
[3774.82 → 3774.98] full
[3774.98 → 3775.10] of
[3775.10 → 3775.52] grace
[3775.52 → 3775.96] seasoned
[3775.96 → 3776.46] with salt
[3776.46 → 3777.24] so that
[3777.24 → 3777.60] you know
[3777.60 → 3778.30] how
[3778.30 → 3778.84] to answer
[3778.84 → 3779.26] everyone
[3779.26 → 3780.88] the first
[3780.88 → 3781.18] thing he
[3781.18 → 3781.70] says here
[3781.70 → 3782.06] is that
[3782.06 → 3782.52] we are
[3782.52 → 3783.28] to respond
[3783.28 → 3784.60] graciously
[3784.60 → 3786.00] and this
[3786.00 → 3786.30] kind of
[3786.30 → 3786.66] has a
[3786.66 → 3786.88] dual
[3786.88 → 3787.32] meaning
[3787.32 → 3788.42] first
[3788.42 → 3788.70] on the
[3788.70 → 3788.92] one
[3788.92 → 3789.22] hand
[3789.22 → 3789.66] we need
[3789.66 → 3789.86] to be
[3789.86 → 3790.18] speaking
[3790.18 → 3790.44] words
[3790.44 → 3790.60] about
[3790.60 → 3790.86] God's
[3790.86 → 3791.24] grace
[3791.24 → 3792.16] right
[3792.16 → 3792.68] the gospel
[3792.68 → 3793.18] of grace
[3793.18 → 3793.50] is that
[3793.50 → 3793.92] we are
[3793.92 → 3794.24] broken
[3794.24 → 3795.24] messes
[3795.24 → 3796.02] but despite
[3796.02 → 3796.66] ourselves
[3796.66 → 3797.32] God loves
[3797.32 → 3797.70] us
[3797.70 → 3798.48] anyway
[3798.48 → 3799.36] in Christ
[3799.36 → 3800.00] and he
[3800.00 → 3800.42] makes us
[3800.42 → 3800.64] new
[3800.64 → 3800.82] through
[3800.82 → 3801.04] faith
[3801.04 → 3801.40] in him
[3801.40 → 3802.40] right
[3802.40 → 3803.22] we know
[3803.22 → 3803.78] and worship
[3803.78 → 3804.50] a gracious
[3804.50 → 3805.18] God
[3805.18 → 3806.36] and anyone
[3806.36 → 3807.16] can come
[3807.16 → 3807.98] to him
[3807.98 → 3808.34] and find
[3808.34 → 3808.88] life in
[3808.88 → 3809.12] him
[3809.12 → 3810.16] so our
[3810.16 → 3810.90] words
[3810.90 → 3811.50] when these
[3811.50 → 3811.98] opportunities
[3811.98 → 3812.42] happen
[3812.42 → 3812.92] our words
[3812.92 → 3813.46] need to be
[3813.46 → 3813.80] words of
[3813.80 → 3814.28] grace
[3814.28 → 3815.76] that we
[3815.76 → 3816.04] can talk
[3816.04 → 3816.22] about
[3816.22 → 3816.60] our own
[3816.60 → 3816.94] lives
[3816.94 → 3817.30] like this
[3817.30 → 3817.56] is how
[3817.56 → 3818.10] I struggle
[3818.10 → 3818.50] but this
[3818.50 → 3819.14] is the
[3819.14 → 3819.46] gospel
[3819.46 → 3819.78] that gives
[3819.78 → 3820.28] me hope
[3820.28 → 3821.12] that's
[3821.12 → 3821.70] very authentic
[3821.70 → 3822.44] if it's
[3822.44 → 3822.76] true of
[3822.76 → 3822.98] you
[3822.98 → 3823.72] and you
[3823.72 → 3824.10] can share
[3824.10 → 3824.46] that when
[3824.46 → 3825.00] the opportunity
[3825.00 → 3825.52] comes
[3825.52 → 3827.80] so our
[3827.80 → 3828.10] words
[3828.10 → 3828.40] need to be
[3828.40 → 3829.16] pointing people
[3829.16 → 3829.96] to God
[3829.96 → 3830.42] and his
[3830.42 → 3830.88] grace
[3830.88 → 3832.06] but also
[3832.06 → 3833.22] we need to
[3833.22 → 3833.84] respond in a
[3833.84 → 3834.24] manner that
[3834.24 → 3834.78] is gracious
[3834.78 → 3836.36] so that
[3836.36 → 3836.94] means that
[3836.94 → 3837.44] there is no
[3837.44 → 3837.80] place
[3837.80 → 3838.46] whatsoever
[3838.46 → 3839.66] for
[3839.66 → 3840.36] arrogance
[3840.36 → 3841.52] for
[3841.52 → 3842.70] self-righteousness
[3842.70 → 3843.02] or for
[3843.02 → 3843.74] condemnation
[3843.74 → 3844.94] right
[3844.94 → 3845.42] in being
[3845.42 → 3845.96] witnesses
[3845.96 → 3846.82] we need
[3846.82 → 3847.92] to challenge
[3847.92 → 3848.38] people
[3848.38 → 3849.82] to repent
[3849.82 → 3851.42] to reorient
[3851.42 → 3852.26] their worlds
[3852.26 → 3852.54] and their
[3852.54 → 3852.98] lives
[3852.98 → 3853.52] to put God
[3853.52 → 3854.14] at the centre
[3854.14 → 3855.02] of their
[3855.02 → 3855.46] life
[3855.46 → 3856.68] but that
[3856.68 → 3857.64] challenge
[3857.64 → 3858.90] doesn't come
[3858.90 → 3859.78] from us
[3859.78 → 3860.14] it comes
[3860.14 → 3860.46] from the
[3860.46 → 3860.86] gospel
[3860.86 → 3862.10] and so we
[3862.10 → 3862.36] are to
[3862.36 → 3862.92] communicate
[3862.92 → 3863.54] the gospel
[3863.54 → 3864.20] graciously
[3864.20 → 3864.68] and it's the
[3864.68 → 3865.36] gospel that
[3865.36 → 3866.00] convicts
[3866.00 → 3866.46] it's the
[3866.46 → 3867.00] gospel that
[3867.00 → 3867.40] confronts
[3867.40 → 3867.76] people in
[3867.76 → 3868.18] their sin
[3868.18 → 3868.86] we don't
[3868.86 → 3869.34] need to
[3869.34 → 3870.16] do anything
[3870.16 → 3870.66] extra
[3870.66 → 3871.16] in some
[3871.16 → 3871.46] way
[3871.46 → 3871.66] that
[3871.66 → 3871.80] is
[3871.80 → 3872.32] condemning
[3872.32 → 3874.12] Paul
[3874.12 → 3874.74] also says
[3874.74 → 3875.02] that our
[3875.02 → 3875.46] words are
[3875.46 → 3875.72] to be
[3875.72 → 3876.10] seasoned
[3876.10 → 3876.82] with salt
[3876.82 → 3878.00] and the
[3878.00 → 3878.88] idea there
[3878.88 → 3880.14] is of
[3880.14 → 3880.98] a well
[3880.98 → 3881.80] prepared
[3881.80 → 3882.88] delicious
[3882.88 → 3884.18] meal
[3884.18 → 3885.64] you know
[3885.64 → 3885.92] when you
[3885.92 → 3886.26] cook a
[3886.26 → 3886.52] meal
[3886.52 → 3887.16] if it's
[3887.16 → 3888.28] well seasoned
[3888.28 → 3889.02] if it's
[3889.02 → 3889.48] delicious
[3889.48 → 3890.84] it makes
[3890.84 → 3891.22] you want
[3891.22 → 3891.58] to eat
[3891.58 → 3891.92] more
[3891.92 → 3892.22] right
[3892.22 → 3893.50] you want
[3893.50 → 3893.98] another
[3893.98 → 3894.80] big helping
[3894.80 → 3895.76] because it's
[3895.76 → 3896.30] so good
[3896.30 → 3897.44] but if
[3897.44 → 3897.86] it's
[3897.86 → 3898.80] bland
[3898.80 → 3899.48] if it's
[3899.48 → 3899.96] just like
[3899.96 → 3900.28] you know
[3900.28 → 3900.86] whatever I
[3900.86 → 3901.42] had in
[3901.42 → 3902.64] the cabinet
[3902.64 → 3903.02] and kind
[3903.02 → 3903.22] of threw
[3903.22 → 3903.72] it together
[3903.72 → 3904.06] and it
[3904.06 → 3904.44] just tastes
[3904.44 → 3904.84] bad
[3904.84 → 3906.00] you know
[3906.00 → 3906.58] when I
[3906.58 → 3906.92] do that
[3906.92 → 3907.28] I have
[3907.28 → 3907.72] to force
[3907.72 → 3908.14] my kids
[3908.14 → 3908.38] to eat
[3908.38 → 3908.60] a few
[3908.60 → 3909.02] bites
[3909.02 → 3909.50] and then
[3909.50 → 3909.64] they're
[3909.64 → 3909.94] like
[3909.94 → 3910.84] I'm
[3910.84 → 3911.30] full
[3911.30 → 3911.84] can we
[3911.84 → 3912.00] have
[3912.00 → 3912.44] ice cream
[3912.44 → 3914.28] okay
[3914.28 → 3914.68] in the
[3914.68 → 3915.04] same
[3915.04 → 3915.58] way
[3915.58 → 3915.92] our
[3915.92 → 3916.30] words
[3916.30 → 3916.54] about
[3916.54 → 3916.92] Jesus
[3916.92 → 3917.42] shouldn't
[3917.42 → 3917.76] be
[3917.76 → 3918.60] bland
[3918.60 → 3919.34] they
[3919.34 → 3919.78] shouldn't
[3919.78 → 3920.08] be
[3920.08 → 3920.52] ill
[3920.52 → 3921.18] prepared
[3921.18 → 3921.86] but
[3921.86 → 3922.40] rather
[3922.40 → 3923.54] they should
[3923.54 → 3923.84] be
[3923.84 → 3924.62] compelling
[3924.62 → 3925.42] they should
[3925.42 → 3925.90] be like
[3925.90 → 3926.60] this is
[3926.60 → 3927.00] delicious
[3927.00 → 3927.72] tell me
[3927.72 → 3928.14] more
[3928.14 → 3928.94] I want
[3928.94 → 3929.16] to know
[3929.16 → 3929.36] more
[3929.36 → 3929.60] about
[3929.60 → 3929.90] Jesus
[3929.90 → 3930.26] this is
[3930.26 → 3930.44] kind
[3930.44 → 3930.54] of
[3930.54 → 3930.82] life
[3930.82 → 3931.14] giving
[3931.14 → 3932.02] tell me
[3932.02 → 3932.26] about
[3932.26 → 3932.48] it
[3932.48 → 3933.04] you know
[3933.04 → 3933.40] we want
[3933.40 → 3933.98] our words
[3933.98 → 3934.68] and evangelism
[3934.68 → 3935.28] to pique
[3935.28 → 3935.84] people's
[3935.84 → 3936.50] interest
[3936.50 → 3937.24] in knowing
[3937.24 → 3937.50] more
[3937.50 → 3937.76] about
[3937.76 → 3938.10] Jesus
[3938.10 → 3938.52] with the
[3938.52 → 3938.80] words
[3938.80 → 3939.08] that we
[3939.08 → 3939.42] say
[3939.42 → 3940.02] because
[3940.02 → 3940.26] they're
[3940.26 → 3940.72] gracious
[3940.72 → 3941.64] they're
[3941.64 → 3941.84] full
[3941.84 → 3942.48] of salt
[3942.48 → 3942.90] they're
[3942.90 → 3943.04] full
[3943.04 → 3943.32] of the
[3943.32 → 3943.80] gospel
[3943.80 → 3945.80] so that's
[3945.80 → 3946.10] what Paul
[3946.10 → 3946.44] is getting
[3946.44 → 3946.74] at
[3946.74 → 3948.84] okay
[3948.84 → 3949.12] so
[3949.12 → 3949.58] we've
[3949.58 → 3949.92] looked at
[3949.92 → 3950.24] a lot
[3950.24 → 3950.74] of things
[3950.74 → 3950.98] about
[3950.98 → 3951.80] God's
[3951.80 → 3952.52] sovereignty
[3952.52 → 3953.04] and
[3953.04 → 3953.54] prayer
[3953.54 → 3954.44] we pray
[3954.44 → 3954.76] to him
[3954.76 → 3955.14] because he's
[3955.14 → 3955.30] the one
[3955.30 → 3955.60] that changes
[3955.60 → 3956.02] hearts
[3956.02 → 3956.66] it's his
[3956.66 → 3957.10] word that
[3957.10 → 3957.62] is central
[3957.62 → 3958.88] but we have
[3958.88 → 3959.58] a responsibility
[3959.58 → 3960.40] it's not to
[3960.40 → 3960.82] have to like
[3960.82 → 3961.22] force the
[3961.22 → 3961.80] conversation
[3961.80 → 3962.20] and talk
[3962.20 → 3962.66] about Jesus
[3962.66 → 3963.44] but it's
[3963.44 → 3964.08] to respond
[3964.08 → 3964.76] and to answer
[3964.76 → 3965.82] where we can
[3965.82 → 3966.22] just be
[3966.22 → 3966.74] prayerfully
[3966.74 → 3967.34] watchful
[3967.34 → 3968.06] for opportunities
[3968.06 → 3968.48] that come
[3968.48 → 3968.94] to us
[3968.94 → 3969.72] and that
[3969.72 → 3969.92] with
[3969.92 → 3971.00] graciousness
[3971.00 → 3972.12] we point
[3972.12 → 3972.56] people to
[3972.56 → 3972.94] Jesus
[3972.94 → 3974.20] and in
[3974.20 → 3974.82] hoping that
[3974.82 → 3975.26] they will
[3975.26 → 3976.22] hear the
[3976.22 → 3976.56] hope that
[3976.56 → 3976.90] we have
[3976.90 → 3977.46] in us
[3977.46 → 3977.92] Christ
[3977.92 → 3978.24] in you
[3978.24 → 3978.54] the hope
[3978.54 → 3979.08] of glory
[3979.08 → 3979.86] and that
[3979.86 → 3980.32] they will
[3980.32 → 3981.02] be interested
[3981.02 → 3981.38] to know
[3981.38 → 3981.72] more
[3981.72 → 3983.78] so I
[3983.78 → 3984.00] want to
[3984.00 → 3984.46] conclude
[3984.46 → 3984.82] with this
[3984.82 → 3985.36] illustration
[3985.36 → 3985.80] that I
[3985.80 → 3986.24] heard
[3986.24 → 3987.28] about
[3987.28 → 3988.44] Lenard's
[3988.44 → 3988.94] exchange
[3988.94 → 3989.44] principle
[3989.44 → 3990.72] so if
[3990.72 → 3990.88] you've
[3990.88 → 3991.00] ever
[3991.00 → 3991.38] watched
[3991.38 → 3992.02] CSI
[3992.02 → 3992.64] or if
[3992.64 → 3992.84] you've
[3992.84 → 3993.04] ever
[3993.04 → 3993.42] read
[3993.42 → 3993.74] like a
[3993.74 → 3994.10] crime
[3994.10 → 3994.60] novel
[3994.60 → 3995.00] you know
[3995.00 → 3995.16] by
[3995.16 → 3995.50] P.D.
[3995.56 → 3995.86] James
[3995.86 → 3996.72] you've
[3996.72 → 3997.08] seen
[3997.08 → 3997.74] Lenard's
[3997.74 → 3998.14] exchange
[3998.14 → 3998.62] principle
[3998.62 → 3999.16] at work
[3999.16 → 4000.56] so Dr.
[4001.00 → 4001.42] Edmund
[4001.42 → 4002.26] Lenard
[4002.26 → 4003.50] was born
[4003.50 → 4004.98] in 1877
[4004.98 → 4006.02] and he
[4006.02 → 4006.36] was a
[4006.36 → 4006.66] French
[4006.66 → 4007.46] criminologist
[4007.46 → 4008.66] before there
[4008.66 → 4009.12] really was
[4009.12 → 4009.80] criminology
[4009.80 → 4010.24] he was
[4010.24 → 4010.46] kind of
[4010.46 → 4010.74] like the
[4010.74 → 4011.26] pioneer
[4011.26 → 4012.22] of
[4012.22 → 4012.58] forensic
[4012.58 → 4013.20] science
[4013.20 → 4014.68] and Lenard
[4014.68 → 4015.10] sought to
[4015.10 → 4015.68] apply the
[4015.68 → 4016.08] scientific
[4016.08 → 4016.66] method
[4016.66 → 4017.40] and logic
[4017.40 → 4018.46] to criminal
[4018.46 → 4019.22] investigation
[4019.22 → 4019.70] and came
[4019.70 → 4019.96] up with
[4019.96 → 4020.12] this
[4020.12 → 4020.52] principle
[4020.52 → 4021.66] that is
[4021.66 → 4022.06] now the
[4022.06 → 4022.92] cornerstone
[4022.92 → 4023.64] of forensic
[4023.64 → 4024.72] science
[4024.72 → 4025.40] even today
[4025.40 → 4026.50] and the
[4026.50 → 4026.84] principle
[4026.84 → 4027.44] is
[4027.44 → 4028.46] every
[4028.46 → 4029.60] contact
[4029.60 → 4030.58] leaves
[4030.58 → 4031.24] a trace
[4031.24 → 4033.02] whenever
[4033.02 → 4033.60] you come
[4033.60 → 4033.76] into
[4033.76 → 4034.20] contact
[4034.20 → 4034.60] with a
[4034.60 → 4034.94] person
[4034.94 → 4035.32] or with
[4035.32 → 4035.48] an
[4035.48 → 4035.94] object
[4035.94 → 4036.84] you
[4036.84 → 4037.24] take
[4037.24 → 4037.54] something
[4037.54 → 4037.84] with
[4037.84 → 4038.06] you
[4038.06 → 4039.24] and
[4039.24 → 4039.46] you
[4039.46 → 4039.92] leave
[4039.92 → 4040.24] something
[4040.24 → 4040.76] behind
[4040.76 → 4041.78] right
[4041.78 → 4042.24] so every
[4042.24 → 4042.60] contact
[4042.60 → 4042.92] no matter
[4042.92 → 4043.62] how small
[4043.62 → 4044.38] or how
[4044.38 → 4045.00] significant
[4045.00 → 4046.44] will leave
[4046.44 → 4047.10] a hair
[4047.10 → 4048.10] will leave
[4048.10 → 4048.70] a fingerprint
[4048.70 → 4049.68] dirt
[4049.68 → 4050.12] from your
[4050.12 → 4050.44] shoe
[4050.44 → 4050.86] lint
[4050.86 → 4051.34] from your
[4051.34 → 4051.76] clothing
[4051.76 → 4053.10] you're
[4053.10 → 4053.54] always
[4053.54 → 4053.92] leaving
[4053.92 → 4054.26] things
[4054.26 → 4055.02] behind
[4055.02 → 4056.18] as a
[4056.18 → 4056.66] witness
[4056.66 → 4057.30] that you
[4057.30 → 4057.76] were there
[4057.76 → 4058.72] you're
[4058.72 → 4059.18] always
[4059.18 → 4060.04] taking
[4060.04 → 4060.42] things
[4060.42 → 4060.66] with
[4060.66 → 4060.90] you
[4060.90 → 4062.10] and I
[4062.10 → 4062.30] think
[4062.30 → 4062.80] Placard's
[4062.80 → 4063.18] exchange
[4063.18 → 4063.54] principle
[4063.54 → 4063.94] not only
[4063.94 → 4064.40] applies to
[4064.40 → 4064.70] criminal
[4064.70 → 4065.16] investigation
[4065.16 → 4066.32] but applies
[4066.32 → 4066.82] to us
[4066.82 → 4067.40] as witnesses
[4067.40 → 4068.04] of Jesus
[4068.04 → 4069.06] because in
[4069.06 → 4069.50] our
[4069.50 → 4070.44] human
[4070.44 → 4071.64] relationships
[4071.64 → 4072.28] our human
[4072.28 → 4072.96] interactions
[4072.96 → 4074.22] whenever we
[4074.22 → 4075.04] have contact
[4075.04 → 4075.54] with other
[4075.54 → 4075.94] people
[4075.94 → 4077.48] we leave
[4077.48 → 4077.78] something
[4077.78 → 4078.28] behind
[4078.28 → 4080.22] our
[4080.22 → 4080.80] contact
[4080.80 → 4081.34] with others
[4081.34 → 4081.62] whether
[4081.62 → 4082.12] small
[4082.12 → 4083.04] or significant
[4083.04 → 4083.72] always
[4083.72 → 4084.48] has an
[4084.48 → 4084.94] impact
[4084.94 → 4086.06] so the
[4086.06 → 4086.34] question
[4086.34 → 4086.74] is not
[4086.74 → 4087.24] will you
[4087.24 → 4087.56] have
[4087.56 → 4087.70] an
[4087.70 → 4088.14] influence
[4088.14 → 4089.32] the
[4089.32 → 4089.66] question
[4089.66 → 4089.88] is
[4089.88 → 4090.10] what
[4090.10 → 4090.52] kind
[4090.52 → 4090.64] of
[4090.64 → 4091.04] influence
[4091.04 → 4091.28] will
[4091.28 → 4091.42] you
[4091.42 → 4091.82] have
[4091.82 → 4092.60] will
[4092.60 → 4092.78] you
[4092.78 → 4093.04] be
[4093.04 → 4093.34] a
[4093.34 → 4093.76] witness
[4093.76 → 4094.10] and
[4094.10 → 4094.46] leave
[4094.46 → 4095.04] something
[4095.04 → 4095.40] of
[4095.40 → 4095.88] Jesus
[4095.88 → 4096.36] or the
[4096.36 → 4096.88] aroma
[4096.88 → 4097.20] of
[4097.20 → 4097.52] Jesus
[4097.52 → 4098.22] the
[4098.22 → 4098.82] word
[4098.82 → 4099.36] about
[4099.36 → 4100.06] Christ
[4100.06 → 4100.62] behind
[4100.62 → 4101.00] with
[4101.00 → 4101.60] every
[4101.60 → 4102.10] person
[4102.10 → 4102.66] as
[4102.66 → 4103.16] God
[4103.16 → 4103.74] gives
[4103.74 → 4103.84] you
[4103.84 → 4104.38] opportunity
[4104.38 → 4106.86] or
[4106.86 → 4107.10] will
[4107.10 → 4107.42] you
[4107.42 → 4108.12] maybe
[4108.12 → 4108.38] be
[4108.38 → 4108.68] changed
[4108.68 → 4108.88] by
[4108.88 → 4109.22] them
[4109.22 → 4109.72] where
[4109.72 → 4109.90] you're
[4109.90 → 4110.04] not
[4110.04 → 4110.28] leaving
[4110.28 → 4110.58] anything
[4110.58 → 4110.82] about
[4110.82 → 4111.18] Jesus
[4111.18 → 4112.06] but
[4112.06 → 4112.28] you're
[4112.28 → 4112.62] maybe
[4112.62 → 4114.18] the
[4114.18 → 4114.56] world
[4114.56 → 4114.74] is
[4114.74 → 4114.96] rubbing
[4114.96 → 4115.22] off
[4115.22 → 4115.38] on
[4115.38 → 4115.58] you
[4115.58 → 4117.18] that's
[4117.18 → 4117.30] the
[4117.30 → 4117.64] question
[4117.64 → 4118.86] that
[4118.86 → 4119.44] we need
[4119.44 → 4119.80] to ask
[4119.80 → 4120.28] ourselves
[4120.28 → 4121.36] as
[4121.36 → 4121.92] witnesses
[4121.92 → 4122.34] of
[4122.34 → 4122.54] Jesus
[4122.54 → 4122.88] Christ
[4122.88 → 4123.14] so
[4123.14 → 4123.34] let's
[4123.34 → 4123.56] pray
[4123.56 → 4126.20] father
[4126.20 → 4126.80] you
[4126.80 → 4127.66] have
[4127.66 → 4127.90] called
[4127.90 → 4128.02] us
[4128.02 → 4128.18] to be
[4128.18 → 4128.28] your
[4128.28 → 4128.76] disciples
[4128.76 → 4129.16] and
[4129.16 → 4129.36] you've
[4129.36 → 4129.54] sent
[4129.54 → 4129.70] us
[4129.70 → 4129.84] out
[4129.84 → 4129.94] to
[4129.94 → 4130.04] be
[4130.04 → 4130.20] your
[4130.20 → 4130.58] witnesses
[4130.58 → 4132.32] and
[4132.32 → 4132.58] Lord
[4132.58 → 4132.90] it

[4133.26 → 4133.82] a
[4133.82 → 4134.04] great
[4134.04 → 4134.70] privilege
[4134.70 → 4135.52] because
[4135.52 → 4135.84] we have

[4138.48 → 4138.72] something
[4138.72 → 4139.20] exciting

[4141.90 → 4142.44] found
[4142.44 → 4142.76] this
[4142.76 → 4143.06] grace
[4143.06 → 4143.28] has
[4143.28 → 4143.54] come
[4143.54 → 4143.70] to

[4143.96 → 4144.06] in
[4144.06 → 4144.26] our

[4144.74 → 4145.94] Lord

[4146.28 → 4146.38] to
[4146.38 → 4146.62] share

[4146.74 → 4146.88] with
