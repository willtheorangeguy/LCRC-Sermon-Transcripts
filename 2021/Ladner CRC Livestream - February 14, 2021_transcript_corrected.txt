[0.00 → 2.74] The ν cooperate
[2.74 → 4.44] of the angel
[4.44 → 5.24] with JJ
[5.24 → 7.44] that can only come
[7.44 → 8.12] to this
[8.12 → 18.10] Prepare for the
[18.10 → 20.42] Spirit
[20.42 → 25.52] pass
[25.52 → 26.56] Remember
[26.56 → 28.94] bedtime
[28.94 → 30.94] Amen.
[58.94 → 60.94] Amen.
[88.94 → 90.94] Amen.
[118.94 → 120.94] Amen.
[148.94 → 150.94] Amen.
[178.94 → 180.94] Amen.
[208.94 → 210.94] Amen.
[238.94 → 240.94] Amen.
[268.94 → 270.94] Amen.

[278.94 → 280.94] Amen.
[280.94 → 282.94] Good morning.
[282.94 → 296.94] It's February 14, St. Valentine's Day, and this is the Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[296.94 → 298.94] Welcome.
[298.94 → 303.50] I'm reminded of the phrase, wherever there are two or more gathered, the Lord is with
[303.50 → 304.50] us.
[304.50 → 308.50] Well, as I look around, we have a quorum here, but just.
[308.50 → 311.58] But we have you at home listening in on us as well.
[311.58 → 312.58] Welcome this morning.
[312.58 → 316.90] If you're a regular attender at our church, you know how things will go this morning.
[316.90 → 322.26] If you're our visitor here, welcome to you as well, with us, with those at home, and with
[322.26 → 326.88] God's church throughout this world.
[326.88 → 330.44] With us this morning we have Mel on the organ.
[330.44 → 332.44] That's not Mel in the background that you hear.
[332.44 → 336.00] That's the snow plow working outside.
[336.00 → 338.00] We have Mel on organ.
[338.00 → 340.56] We have Mel on organ.
[340.56 → 344.56] We have Tony on piano this morning.
[344.56 → 348.56] Bart and Jackie and Tony are our praise team this morning.
[348.56 → 352.12] Behind the cameras, we have Julia and Jake and Doug.
[352.12 → 356.12] And I'm John Smith, and I'll be a worship leader for portions of this service this morning.
[356.12 → 361.12] Later, Pastor Jason True will open God's word and will bring a message from John 15.
[361.12 → 364.68] This morning is another in the I Am series.
[364.68 → 368.68] This morning is I Am the True Vine.
[368.68 → 372.68] We will also commemorate the Lord's Supper later in this service.
[372.68 → 380.68] If you're at home, and you desire, have the bread and juice elements ready for later on in this service,
[380.68 → 384.68] shortly after the sermon.
[384.68 → 388.24] Our offering today is for M2W2.
[388.24 → 394.24] Many of you will know that this is a Christian proactive social justice organization working to transform lives,
[394.24 → 396.24] one relationship at a time.
[396.24 → 402.24] Their staff and volunteers are active inside prisons as well as in our communities.
[402.24 → 406.72] Next week, the offering is for a very familiar cause, the Delta Christian School.
[406.72 → 416.28] For our visitors' information, this is our local K-7 school offering a Christ-entered education built on academic excellence.
[416.28 → 422.68] This church has decades of connection and support with that school,
[422.68 → 426.48] and we ask you to contribute generously again today.
[426.48 → 428.48] You can drop off a check at the church.
[428.48 → 432.16] You can mail it in or make an online contribution.
[432.16 → 438.16] Remember, we're in this new environment of one envelope for where you can specify multiple offerings.
[438.16 → 442.72] Oftentimes, you might want to choose just once per month, as I do.
[442.72 → 447.16] And that's what the deacons have arranged for us this year.
[447.16 → 451.72] And once again, we thank you for your solid and continuing support.
[451.72 → 456.72] Our call to worship is a responsive reading.
[456.72 → 464.72] It's inspired by Psalm 20 and 2 Corinthians 5 and was written by a gentleman named Bruce Purer.
[464.72 → 474.72] Some boast of their motor cars and some of their mansions, but we boast of the name of the Lord of hosts.
[474.72 → 479.72] Should all else collapse in a heap, we shall stand up tall.
[479.72 → 487.72] Do not be impressed by the outward appearance of a person, for God does not seem like we do, but looks into the heart.
[487.72 → 492.72] If anyone travels with Christ, there is a new creation.
[492.72 → 494.72] Old things are obsolete.
[494.72 → 496.72] All things become new.
[496.72 → 504.72] Let us worship this God who looks into the human heart and through Christ Jesus makes all things new.
[504.72 → 508.72] Let's open this service with a welcoming song.
[508.72 → 511.72] Now is the time to worship.
[511.72 → 534.72] Come.
[534.72 → 535.72] Come.
[535.72 → 541.72] Now is the time to worship.
[541.72 → 544.72] Come.
[544.72 → 550.72] Now is the time to give your heart.
[550.72 → 551.72] Come.
[551.72 → 552.72] Come.
[552.72 → 553.72] Come.
[553.72 → 558.72] Just as you are to worship.
[558.72 → 559.72] Come.
[559.72 → 566.72] Just as you are before your God.
[566.72 → 567.72] Come.
[567.72 → 568.72] Come.
[568.72 → 569.72] Come.
[569.72 → 572.72] One day every tongue will confess you our God.
[572.72 → 575.72] One day every knee will bow.
[575.72 → 590.72] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[590.72 → 592.72] Come.
[592.72 → 597.72] Now is the time to worship.
[597.72 → 598.72] Come.
[598.72 → 599.72] Come.
[599.72 → 609.72] Now is the time to give your heart.
[609.72 → 611.72] Come.
[611.72 → 617.72] Just as you are to worship.
[617.72 → 620.72] Come.
[620.72 → 625.72] Just as you are before your God.
[625.72 → 626.72] Come.
[626.72 → 627.72] Come.
[627.72 → 628.72] Come.
[628.72 → 631.72] Willingly we choose to surrender our lives.
[631.72 → 632.72] Willingly our needs propound.
[632.72 → 646.72] With all our hearts of light and strength we gladly choose you now.
[646.72 → 647.72] Come.
[647.72 → 648.72] Come.
[648.72 → 649.72] Come.
[649.72 → 653.72] Now is the time to worship.
[653.72 → 654.72] Come.
[654.72 → 659.72] Now is the time to worship.
[659.72 → 660.72] Come.
[660.72 → 666.72] Now is the time to give your heart.
[666.72 → 667.72] Come.
[667.72 → 668.72] Come.
[668.72 → 669.72] Oh.
[669.72 → 670.72] Come.
[670.72 → 671.72] Come.
[671.72 → 675.72] Come.
[675.72 → 676.72] Come.
[676.72 → 678.72] Come.
[678.72 → 689.72] Just as you are before your God.
[689.72 → 694.72] Come.
[694.72 → 708.30] Now that we've come to worship, the Lord's greeting comes from the Apostle Paul's words
[708.30 → 715.60] in 1 Corinthians 1, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[716.40 → 722.00] Paul continues in 1 Corinthians, I always thank my God for you because of his grace
[722.00 → 728.20] given you in Christ Jesus for in you, in him, you have been enriched in every way.
[728.44 → 733.42] And he could be speaking to us this morning, in him, we are enriched in every way.
[735.12 → 741.94] And so as an opening praise to God, I've selected Psalm 145, one of the last psalms that David
[741.94 → 745.38] wrote, and it really is a prayer of adoration.
[745.92 → 748.80] I'm reading the first seven verses and then verse 21.
[748.80 → 753.26] I will exalt you, my God, the King.
[753.94 → 756.12] I will praise your name forever and ever.
[756.90 → 761.04] Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[761.78 → 764.54] Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[764.84 → 767.26] His greatness no one can fathom.
[768.42 → 770.88] One generation commends your works to another.
[771.06 → 772.84] They tell of your mighty acts.
[773.18 → 776.46] They speak of the glorious splendour of your majesty.
[776.46 → 779.60] I will meditate on your wonderful works.
[780.42 → 783.40] They tell of the power of your awesome works.
[783.74 → 786.18] And I will proclaim your great deeds.
[787.16 → 789.72] My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[790.06 → 794.58] Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[795.68 → 800.24] Let's sing of that in a couple of songs of praise beginning with forever.
[800.24 → 800.38] Forever.
[800.38 → 800.44] Forever.
[800.44 → 800.46] Forever.
[800.46 → 800.50] Forever.
[806.46 → 824.38] Give thanks to the Lord, our God and King.
[824.38 → 827.60] His love endures forever.
[829.10 → 833.52] For he is good, he is above all things.
[833.52 → 836.68] His love endures forever.
[836.68 → 836.80] Forever.
[836.80 → 837.80] Sing praise.
[837.80 → 839.68] Sing praise.
[842.30 → 844.80] Sing praise.
[847.34 → 851.80] With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
[852.16 → 855.06] His love endures forever.
[857.28 → 861.06] For the life that's been reborn.
[861.06 → 866.16] This love endures forever.
[866.16 → 867.50] Everybody sing praise.
[867.50 → 868.72] Sing praise.
[869.72 → 872.44] Sing praise.
[874.56 → 875.84] Sing praise.
[875.84 → 876.22] Sing praise.
[876.78 → 877.78] Sing praise.
[877.78 → 883.38] Sing praise
[883.38 → 887.12] Forever God is faithful
[887.12 → 892.06] Forever God is strong
[892.06 → 896.32] Forever God is with us
[896.32 → 897.66] Forever
[897.66 → 901.82] Forever
[901.82 → 910.14] From the rising to the setting sun
[910.14 → 913.32] His love endures forever
[913.32 → 918.88] And by the grace of God we will carry on
[918.88 → 922.12] His love endures forever
[922.12 → 925.44] Sing praise
[925.44 → 929.60] Sing praise
[929.60 → 934.08] Sing praise
[934.08 → 938.08] Sing praise
[938.08 → 940.24] Sing praise
[940.24 → 944.28] Forever God is faithful
[944.28 → 948.86] Forever God is strong
[948.86 → 953.12] Forever God is with us
[953.12 → 954.46] Forever
[954.46 → 957.96] Forever
[957.96 → 986.44] Heavens
[986.44 → 995.02] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[995.02 → 1002.28] that's a measure of our strength,
[1002.78 → 1009.48] rolling as the mighty ocean,
[1009.48 → 1016.48] in exodus over thee.
[1016.48 → 1023.48] Under the sea of the mountain
[1023.48 → 1031.48] is the pure of thy love,
[1031.48 → 1039.92] leading onward, leading onward,
[1040.44 → 1046.48] to thy glorious rest above.
[1050.48 → 1056.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1056.48 → 1063.48] spread his praise from shore to shore.
[1064.48 → 1071.48] How he loves us, ever loves us,
[1071.48 → 1078.48] to teach us never, ever more.
[1078.48 → 1087.48] How he watches for his loved ones,
[1087.48 → 1094.48] died to call them of his own.
[1094.48 → 1102.48] Love for heaven is interceding,
[1102.48 → 1111.48] watching over them from now on.
[1111.48 → 1121.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1121.48 → 1131.48] love of Jesus,
[1131.48 → 1138.48] love of every love of the best.
[1138.48 → 1140.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1140.48 → 1144.48] this our heaven, sweet our best.
[1144.48 → 1150.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1150.48 → 1155.48] this our heaven, sweet our best.
[1155.48 → 1159.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1159.48 → 1161.48] this our heaven, sweet our best.
[1161.48 → 1165.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1165.48 → 1169.48] this our heaven, sweet our best.
[1169.48 → 1171.48] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[1171.48 → 1173.48] this our heaven, sweet our best.
[1173.48 → 1179.48] And it lifts me up to glory,
[1179.48 → 1183.48] glory, glory, glory,
[1183.48 → 1191.48] lets me unto thee.
[1209.48 → 1213.48] In a time of confession,
[1213.48 → 1216.48] I'm reminded of the words of Isaiah 5,
[1216.48 → 1218.48] verses 1 to 7.
[1218.48 → 1221.48] In Isaiah's time, God called him
[1221.48 → 1223.48] to tell the people of Israel
[1223.48 → 1225.48] that they were not doing well.
[1225.48 → 1227.48] They were not obeying his commands.
[1227.48 → 1228.48] They were sinful.
[1228.48 → 1232.48] And he used the analogy of a grape vine
[1232.48 → 1235.48] and grapes as a way to explain that to people,
[1235.48 → 1237.48] that they were not doing well.
[1237.48 → 1239.48] In a time of confession,
[1239.48 → 1240.48] think about these words
[1240.48 → 1243.48] because they relate later on to Jesus' message
[1243.48 → 1245.48] who also similarly
[1245.48 → 1247.48] used the analogy of a grape vine
[1247.48 → 1250.48] and who is the true vine.
[1250.48 → 1253.48] And Jason will later in this service
[1253.48 → 1257.48] hark back to that matter entirely.
[1257.48 → 1261.48] But for now, let's read the words of Isaiah 5.
[1263.48 → 1266.48] I will sing for the one I love,
[1266.48 → 1268.48] a song about his vineyard.
[1268.48 → 1270.48] My loved one had a vineyard
[1270.48 → 1272.48] on a fertile hillside.
[1272.48 → 1274.48] He dug it up, cleared it of stones,
[1274.48 → 1277.48] and planted it with the choicest vines.
[1277.48 → 1279.48] He built a watch tower in it
[1279.48 → 1281.48] and cut out a wine press as well.
[1281.48 → 1284.48] Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
[1284.48 → 1286.48] but it yielded only bad fruit.
[1286.48 → 1288.48] Now you dwellers in Jerusalem
[1288.48 → 1289.48] and people of Judah,
[1289.48 → 1291.48] judge between me and my vineyard.
[1291.48 → 1294.48] What more could have been done in my vineyard
[1294.48 → 1296.48] than I have done for it?
[1296.48 → 1298.48] When I looked for good grapes,
[1298.48 → 1301.48] why did it yield only bad?
[1301.48 → 1305.48] Now I tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard.
[1305.48 → 1307.48] I will take away its hedge
[1307.48 → 1308.48] and it will be destroyed.
[1308.48 → 1310.48] I will break down its wall
[1310.48 → 1312.48] and it will be trampled.
[1312.48 → 1314.48] I will make it a wasteland,
[1314.48 → 1316.48] neither pruned nor cultivated,
[1316.48 → 1319.48] and briars and thorns will grow there.
[1319.48 → 1323.48] I will command the clouds not to rain on it.
[1323.48 → 1326.48] The vineyard of the Lord Almighty
[1326.48 → 1327.48] is the nation of Israel
[1327.48 → 1328.48] and the people of Judah
[1328.48 → 1330.48] are the vines he delighted in.
[1330.48 → 1332.48] And he looked for justice,
[1332.48 → 1334.48] but he saw bloodshed.
[1334.48 → 1336.48] For righteousness,
[1336.48 → 1338.48] but heard cries of distress.
[1341.48 → 1343.48] But Isaiah wasn't finished.
[1343.48 → 1348.48] In 22 chapters later in Isaiah 27,
[1348.48 → 1351.48] he pointed out that God is gracious.
[1351.48 → 1353.48] God does forgive.
[1353.48 → 1355.48] God can restore people.
[1355.48 → 1357.48] And that's our message of assurance this morning,
[1357.48 → 1361.48] reading from Isaiah 27 verses 3 and 6.
[1361.48 → 1365.48] In that day, the deliverance of Israel,
[1365.48 → 1368.48] in that day, sing about a fruitful vineyard.
[1368.48 → 1370.48] I, the Lord, watch over it.
[1370.48 → 1372.48] I water it continually.
[1372.48 → 1374.48] I guard it day and night
[1374.48 → 1376.48] so that no one may harm it.
[1376.48 → 1380.48] In days to come, Jacob will take root.
[1380.48 → 1382.48] Israel will bud and blossom
[1382.48 → 1385.48] and fill all the world with fruit.
[1385.48 → 1389.48] Once again, Isaiah speaks of the long-suffering,
[1389.48 → 1392.48] suffering, grace, and forgiveness of God.
[1392.48 → 1395.48] Through our faith in Jesus our Saviour,
[1395.48 → 1397.48] that also applies to us.
[1397.48 → 1400.48] Shortly, we will sing,
[1400.48 → 1401.48], and can it be?
[1401.48 → 1404.48] And can it be that I should gain?
[1404.48 → 1407.48] No condemnation, now I dread.
[1407.48 → 1412.48] Amazing love, how can it be?
[1412.48 → 1414.48] Listen to these words and sing with us.
[1414.48 → 1416.48] Thanks be to God.
[1416.48 → 1417.48] Thanks be to God,
[1417.48 → 1418.48] I nostrils.
[1418.48 → 1419.48] I love you.
[1419.48 → 1420.48] Thanks be to God.
[1420.48 → 1421.48] Yeah.
[1421.48 → 1422.48] I love you.
[1422.48 → 1423.48] To bee nailed.
[1423.48 → 1425.48] There is a sin.
[1425.48 → 1426.48] See you.
[1426.48 → 1427.48] See you.
[1427.48 → 1430.48] I'll give you all the rich scripture.
[1430.48 → 1431.48] If you do this,
[1431.48 → 1432.48] people intheriquement,
[1432.48 → 1462.46] . . .
[1462.48 → 1492.46] . . .
[1492.48 → 1492.98] . . .
[1492.98 → 1494.48] . . .
[1494.48 → 1500.48] . . .
[1500.48 → 1508.48] That you, my Lord, should die for me.
[1510.48 → 1517.48] He let his Father's throne above,
[1517.48 → 1525.48] So free, so in full, he made his grace,
[1525.48 → 1532.48] And deed himself of hope upon,
[1532.48 → 1540.48] And bled for Adam's helpless grace.
[1540.48 → 1548.48] What mercy is, be blessed and free,
[1548.48 → 1556.48] For all my God, him found out me.
[1556.48 → 1562.48] Amazing love, O King,
[1562.48 → 1573.48] That you, my Lord, should die for me.
[1578.48 → 1597.48] O God, the nations, how wide may,
[1597.48 → 1605.48] For Christ and all, in him is mine,
[1605.48 → 1612.48] Abide in him, my living hell,
[1612.48 → 1620.48] And gloom in righteousness divine.
[1620.48 → 1627.48] Bold I approach the eternal throne,
[1627.48 → 1635.48] And claim the crown to Christ my own.
[1635.48 → 1641.48] Amazing love, O King,
[1641.48 → 1656.48] That you, my Lord, should die for me.
[1665.48 → 1672.48] Well, good morning, friends.
[1672.48 → 1676.48] Here in Ladder, the snow is lightly falling,
[1676.48 → 1678.48] And it's very beautiful.
[1678.48 → 1682.48] Yesterday, my kids and I were able to go out to the local elementary school,
[1682.48 → 1686.48] And do a little sledding down a very small hill.
[1686.48 → 1690.48] But we got a little speed going, and it was a lot of fun.
[1690.48 → 1697.48] And so we've been in a sermon series exploring the am sayings of Jesus from the Gospel of John.
[1697.48 → 1702.48] And today we're going to wrap up with the final I am saying,
[1702.48 → 1705.48] Which is Jesus' great proclamation,
[1705.48 → 1709.48] Where he says, I am the true vine.
[1709.48 → 1710.48] I am the true vine.
[1710.48 → 1713.48] So this morning we're in John chapter 15.
[1713.48 → 1716.48] So if you have a Bible, I invite you to turn there.
[1716.48 → 1722.48] So Jesus and his disciples have eaten the Passover meal,
[1722.48 → 1726.48] And now they have left the upper room.
[1726.48 → 1729.48] They're out walking on the Mount of Olives.
[1729.48 → 1732.48] It was one of their favourite places to go.
[1732.48 → 1738.48] And Jesus here gives them this extraordinary teaching that actually applies to us as well.
[1738.48 → 1742.48] And so here it is, John 15, we'll read verses 1 through 8.
[1742.48 → 1747.48] I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.
[1747.48 → 1751.48] He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit,
[1751.48 → 1755.48] While every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes,
[1755.48 → 1758.48] So that it will be even more fruitful.
[1758.48 → 1763.48] You are already clean because of the word I've spoken to you.
[1763.48 → 1767.48] Remain in me as I also remain in you.
[1767.48 → 1771.48] No branch can bear fruit by itself.
[1771.48 → 1774.48] It must remain in the vine.
[1774.48 → 1779.48] Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
[1779.48 → 1782.48] I am the vine.
[1782.48 → 1784.48] You are the branches.
[1784.48 → 1788.48] If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[1788.48 → 1790.48] Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[1790.48 → 1795.48] If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers.
[1795.48 → 1799.48] Such branches are picked up and thrown into the fire and burned.
[1799.48 → 1808.48] If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
[1808.48 → 1818.48] This is to my Father's glory that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
[1818.48 → 1821.48] This is the word of the Lord.
[1821.48 → 1824.48] Would you join me in a word of prayer?
[1824.48 → 1825.48] Let's pray together.
[1825.48 → 1827.48] Let's pray together.
[1827.48 → 1832.48] Holy Spirit, we pray that you would be present with us.
[1832.48 → 1842.48] And just as Jesus here gave us this extraordinary teaching about us living and abiding and remaining in him and he in us.
[1842.48 → 1846.48] Lord, we pray that that would be true of each of us even this morning.
[1846.48 → 1849.48] That you would be present with us.
[1849.48 → 1851.48] That you would remain in us.
[1851.48 → 1855.48] And as you do so, Lord, would teach us your word.
[1855.48 → 1858.48] Would you open our eyes, our hearts.
[1858.48 → 1862.48] Would you allow us to receive what this means for us today.
[1862.48 → 1865.48] So that we could be your fruitful disciples.
[1865.48 → 1868.48] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[1868.48 → 1874.48] So as you know, most countries have a national symbol.
[1874.48 → 1878.48] The national symbol of the United States is a bald eagle.
[1878.48 → 1883.48] Though growing up in the US, I can't actually remember ever seeing a bald eagle.
[1883.48 → 1892.48] And it's not until I moved here to Richmond where we can look, you know, walk all around the neighbourhood here, walk on the dike, and you can see eagles everywhere.
[1892.48 → 1894.48] You can see them perching on the trees.
[1894.48 → 1896.48] It's just like a common bird.
[1896.48 → 1898.48] So it's quite amazing.
[1898.48 → 1900.48] And so the US has an eagle.
[1900.48 → 1905.48] Now the national symbol of England is a lion.
[1905.48 → 1910.48] Because obviously lions are a very common indigenous creature to England.
[1910.48 → 1921.48] Now Canada, wanting to also show their ferocious, intimidating side, has gone for a maple leaf.
[1921.48 → 1923.48] It's very fitting, I think.
[1923.48 → 1927.48] Now I know at least two people in our church have a connection with Scotland.
[1927.48 → 1935.48] One of them is here and saying for us earlier, well, the emblem of Scotland is a thistle.
[1935.48 → 1942.48] And it may interest you to know that in Genesis chapter 3, the sign that God has cursed the world is a thistle.
[1942.48 → 1946.48] Now I'm just offering that to you as an observation.
[1946.48 → 1951.48] Actually though, I did go online, and I Googled it, and it's a beautiful flower.
[1951.48 → 1953.48] It's very kind of rich purple.
[1953.48 → 1956.48] So all joking aside, it's a nice flower.
[1956.48 → 1964.48] But now in the Old Testament, Israel's national symbol was a vine.
[1964.48 → 1965.48] And that wasn't random.
[1965.48 → 1968.48] It was actually very fitting.
[1968.48 → 1973.48] Because the vine spoke of who they were and what their purpose was.
[1973.48 → 1975.48] What they were all about as a nation.
[1975.48 → 1980.48] It reminded them that God had planted them in the land.
[1980.48 → 1986.48] It reminded them that they were there to bear fruit.
[1987.48 → 1991.48] So now I want to begin this morning with a question for us today.
[1991.48 → 1996.48] That is, what is the goal of the Christian life?
[1996.48 → 2008.48] You know if you had to, in your mind, define what it is to be a follower of Christ, what is it?
[2008.48 → 2013.48] You know, it may be that some of us this morning has been Christians for many years.
[2013.48 → 2023.48] And if that's the case for you, this passage is a beautiful reminder to us of what to expect as we continue as Christians.
[2023.48 → 2029.48] It may be that some of us are looking into the Christian faith.
[2029.48 → 2037.48] In which case, again, it's useful to hear Jesus describe what being a Christian is going to involve for you.
[2039.48 → 2046.48] And I would like to put it to us, either way, wherever we are this morning,
[2046.48 → 2053.48] that just as Israel was to be a fruitful vine for God, the same is true for us today.
[2053.48 → 2062.48] That what it means to be a Christian is that we also are planted in the time and the place that God has placed us,
[2062.48 → 2065.48] in order for us to bear fruit for Him.
[2065.48 → 2074.48] And Jesus is going to promise us that if you are connected to Him, He will produce spiritual fruit in your life.
[2074.48 → 2077.48] So that's what we're looking at today.
[2077.48 → 2079.48] So let's take a look at this passage together.
[2079.48 → 2084.48] And there are three things I'd like us to see from this passage this morning.
[2084.48 → 2088.48] They are, first, about Jesus, that He is the true vine.
[2088.48 → 2094.48] Secondly, the disciples, how they are dependent branches.
[2094.48 → 2097.48] And then we're going to look at what does it mean to be a vine?
[2097.48 → 2098.48] Kind of the life of the vine.
[2098.48 → 2100.48] So the first one, Jesus, the true vine.
[2100.48 → 2107.48] What do we learn here about Jesus and what it means when He says that, I am the true vine?
[2107.48 → 2114.48] So Jesus and the disciples, as I've mentioned already, are likely walking on the Mount of Olives.
[2114.48 → 2118.48] They're probably in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[2118.48 → 2124.48] Geographically speaking, it is outside the old city of Jerusalem, outside the city walls up on the hill.
[2124.48 → 2129.48] And from the top of that hill, you can look down into the temple courts.
[2129.48 → 2136.48] And this is also where Judas, that same night, will find Jesus.
[2136.48 → 2139.48] And it's where Jesus will be arrested.
[2139.48 → 2141.48] That's where they are.
[2141.48 → 2148.48] And so the main thrust of Jesus' teaching in these few chapters in the Gospel of John,
[2148.48 → 2152.48] before Jesus is arrested in His trial and crucifixion,
[2152.48 → 2159.48] what Jesus is trying to teach them is what will happen when He's gone.
[2159.48 → 2166.48] Right? He's trying to prepare the disciples for life without Him, at least without Him physically.
[2166.48 → 2171.48] What does a life connected to Jesus, even if Jesus is physically absent,
[2171.48 → 2178.48] what will that look like for the disciples and for us today as modern Christians?
[2178.48 → 2184.48] And to explain that, Jesus reaches for an agricultural metaphor.
[2184.48 → 2189.48] He says to them, I am the true vine.
[2189.48 → 2195.48] Maybe in the garden, they were standing there and there was a vine right there that He was able to point to.
[2195.48 → 2198.48] Now, it's a short sentence.
[2198.48 → 2199.48] Statement.
[2199.48 → 2200.48] I am the true vine.
[2200.48 → 2202.48] Five little words.
[2202.48 → 2205.48] But it is loaded with significance.
[2205.48 → 2210.48] So this is Jesus' seventh and final I am saying in the Gospel of John.
[2210.48 → 2215.48] Remember, these are definitive claims that He is the God of Israel.
[2215.48 → 2223.48] When God, back in Exodus, was going to send Moses to free His people out of Egypt,
[2223.48 → 2228.48] Moses asked God, whom shall I say sent me to them?
[2228.48 → 2233.48] And God says, say, I am has sent you.
[2233.48 → 2238.48] It's a name that means simply that God is.
[2238.48 → 2241.48] God was always and always will be.
[2241.48 → 2245.48] He is life in Himself.
[2245.48 → 2255.48] And here, Jesus comes, and He's making all of these statements where He is claiming the authority and the identity of who God is.
[2255.48 → 2260.48] And here, He says, I am the true vine.
[2260.48 → 2269.48] Now, this vine metaphor throughout Scripture is actually not used though of God, but of Israel, as we've already read a little bit this morning.
[2269.48 → 2273.48] So let me give you some more Old Testament references.
[2273.48 → 2278.48] In Psalm 80, verse 8, the psalmist writes,
[2278.48 → 2282.48] You, God, transplanted a vine from Egypt.
[2282.48 → 2285.48] You drove out the nations and planted it.
[2285.48 → 2290.48] And so this is a reference to the Exodus, when God brought His people out of slavery,
[2290.48 → 2295.48] and then planted them in the promised land, in Canaan.
[2295.48 → 2300.48] Another passage that we already looked at this morning is Isaiah 5, verse 7.
[2300.48 → 2301.48] It says,
[2301.48 → 2317.48] Okay, so in the Old Testament, Israel is the vine of the Lord.
[2317.48 → 2319.48] Israel was God's chosen people.
[2319.48 → 2327.48] And if you kind of think about what a vine is and how it grows, this metaphor actually makes a lot of sense.
[2327.48 → 2333.48] Because vines take tending, they take cultivation, they take work.
[2333.48 → 2336.48] Right? They require special land.
[2336.48 → 2339.48] And this is how God treated Israel all the way along.
[2339.48 → 2341.48] He planted them in a special place.
[2341.48 → 2343.48] He made space for them.
[2343.48 → 2345.48] He tended them and cultivated them.
[2345.48 → 2347.48] He protected them.
[2347.48 → 2351.48] And God is the vine dresser of Israel.
[2351.48 → 2357.48] But why was Israel chosen to be God's vineyard?
[2357.48 → 2361.48] God says, I have chosen you from among the nations,
[2361.48 → 2368.48] not because you were smart or mighty or special in any way.
[2368.48 → 2375.48] But God says, I chose you because you were actually small and insignificant.
[2375.48 → 2381.48] So that I might reveal through your smallness, my greatness and my glory.
[2381.48 → 2387.48] And that you would then become literally a nation of priests.
[2387.48 → 2393.48] And then by which the world would then come to know me, the true God.
[2393.48 → 2400.48] That as Israel lived under God's protection, as Israel obeyed God's commands,
[2400.48 → 2406.48] that the nations would see what it's like to have this covenant relationship with God
[2406.48 → 2410.48] and that they would be drawn in to become God's people.
[2410.48 → 2412.48] That was their task.
[2412.48 → 2413.48] But what happened?
[2413.48 → 2416.48] Israel failed in that task.
[2416.48 → 2422.48] Israel never realized that it wasn't only about them, that it was about God's love for the nations.
[2422.48 → 2427.48] And that vines are supposed to actually produce fat, juicy grapes.
[2427.48 → 2432.48] The whole reason for having a vineyard is for it to produce fruit.
[2433.48 → 2438.48] But Israel grew mostly weeds, spiritually speaking.
[2438.48 → 2448.48] So in Jeremiah 2, verse 21, God says, I had planted you like a choice vine of sound, reliable stock.
[2448.48 → 2453.48] How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?
[2453.48 → 2454.48] Right?
[2454.48 → 2464.48] Despite having God as their vine dresser, and despite having every spiritual advantage, Israel never fulfilled his purpose.
[2464.48 → 2476.48] And instead of bringing the surrounding nations to come and know the true God, Israel actually broke covenant with God and worshipped the gods of the surrounding nations, breaking the Father's heart.
[2476.48 → 2481.48] So Jesus comes along and says, I am the true vine.
[2481.48 → 2482.48] Right?
[2482.48 → 2486.48] And when Jesus says that he is the true vine, he is saying he is the true Israel.
[2486.48 → 2489.48] He is the people of God.
[2489.48 → 2493.48] He is what God's people were always meant to be, but never were.
[2493.48 → 2502.48] See, Jesus came to fulfill Israel's vocation, their mission to be the true people of God.
[2502.48 → 2506.48] And to lead all the nations to come and to know God.
[2506.48 → 2507.48] That's who Jesus is.
[2507.48 → 2509.48] He is the true vine.
[2509.48 → 2515.48] He came to bear this fruit that would be the nations coming to know and worship God.
[2515.48 → 2528.48] And in fact, the message of Christianity is that it is only possible for us to be part of the people of God by being part of Jesus.
[2528.48 → 2540.48] If he is the true people of God, in other words, the only way that we can become part of the people of God, the only way we can join is through Jesus.
[2541.48 → 2546.48] By being connected to him as the true vine.
[2547.48 → 2549.48] Okay, so that's the first point this morning.
[2549.48 → 2552.48] That Jesus is the true vine.
[2552.48 → 2563.48] And that leads us to the second thing we see here, which is if Jesus is the vine, his disciples, his followers, his people are dependent branches.
[2563.48 → 2565.48] And we see that kind of throughout the passage.
[2565.48 → 2568.48] But here in verse 5 it says, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[2568.48 → 2569.48] Right?
[2569.48 → 2570.48] It's pretty straightforward.
[2570.48 → 2580.48] And branches, if we kind of think about the metaphor, branches, if you cut them off from the main vine, what happens to them?
[2580.48 → 2584.48] If they are disconnected from the vine, they wither and they die.
[2584.48 → 2588.48] Because there is no source of life in them.
[2588.48 → 2592.48] The life of the branch comes from being connected to the vine.
[2592.48 → 2598.48] And the life of the vine passes through the branch and then in the branch bears fruit or flowers.
[2598.48 → 2603.48] And this is what Jesus says at the end of verse 5, where he says,
[2603.48 → 2609.48] Well, apart from me, not being connected to me, if you're separated, you can do nothing.
[2609.48 → 2612.48] If you're cut off from him, there is no fruit.
[2612.48 → 2615.48] The only way to be fruitful is to be connected to the vine.
[2615.48 → 2621.48] And so then if we follow the metaphor, the way that we as Christians produce spiritual fruit,
[2621.48 → 2624.48] the fruit of being a Christian is to be connected to Jesus.
[2624.48 → 2629.48] And over and over, this passage uses this word that you probably noticed.
[2629.48 → 2631.48] Jesus says, remain.
[2631.48 → 2632.48] Okay?
[2632.48 → 2637.48] And he uses this word remain to describe being connected to him.
[2637.48 → 2643.48] In fact, Jesus uses the word remain seven times in eight verses.
[2643.48 → 2648.48] So I think Jesus is telling us something that is really important.
[2648.48 → 2654.48] So we're talking about this idea of remaining or being connected to God.
[2654.48 → 2659.48] And, you know, I think the Christian life can be described in many ways.
[2659.48 → 2662.48] But here's one way to think about it.
[2662.48 → 2665.48] That the Christian life is about three things.
[2665.48 → 2669.48] First, the Christian life is about thinking and knowing.
[2669.48 → 2670.48] Right?
[2670.48 → 2675.48] To be a Christian, you actually have to believe certain things about who God is,
[2675.48 → 2681.48] about who humanity is, excuse me, and about this world.
[2681.48 → 2682.48] Okay?
[2682.48 → 2684.48] So it's about thinking and knowing.
[2684.48 → 2687.48] But secondly, the Christian life is also about living.
[2687.48 → 2694.48] It's about a way of life, of following Jesus' commands, obeying his teachings,
[2694.48 → 2698.48] so that we actually embody the life of Jesus in this world.
[2698.48 → 2700.48] We live it out.
[2700.48 → 2701.48] Okay?
[2701.48 → 2702.48] But that's not the whole of it.
[2702.48 → 2703.48] Right?
[2703.48 → 2706.48] The Christian life is not only about what we believe.
[2706.48 → 2710.48] It's not only about our ethics and our behaviour.
[2710.48 → 2715.48] It's also about experiencing an intimate communion with Jesus Christ.
[2715.48 → 2724.48] Where at this kind of heart level, we have a connection with God himself as a person.
[2724.48 → 2728.48] So that's kind of the third dimension of the Christian life.
[2728.48 → 2730.48] Not only in believing.
[2730.48 → 2731.48] Not only in behaving.
[2731.48 → 2733.48] But in this abiding.
[2733.48 → 2737.48] This communion again of being with Jesus.
[2737.48 → 2741.48] You know, and Christians have used lots of ways to describe this down throughout church history.
[2741.48 → 2746.48] Some people have talked about a mystical union with Christ.
[2746.48 → 2750.48] Some speak of a sense of God's presence in our lives.
[2750.48 → 2753.48] Or maybe in keeping in step with the Spirit.
[2753.48 → 2760.48] But whatever language you use, what's clear is that the Christian life involves remaining in Christ.
[2761.48 → 2765.48] Or as some translations say, abiding in Christ.
[2765.48 → 2768.48] That it's not just about doctrine.
[2768.48 → 2769.48] It's not just about behaving.
[2769.48 → 2773.48] But there's a sense in which your life is with God.
[2773.48 → 2776.48] You in Him and He in you.
[2777.48 → 2780.48] And I know that sounds mysterious.
[2780.48 → 2783.48] But that's what Jesus is describing here.
[2783.48 → 2784.48] Right?
[2784.48 → 2789.48] He says, remain in me as I also remain in you.
[2789.48 → 2792.48] Like, He's really meaning something by that.
[2792.48 → 2798.48] And so if all we're doing is just, say, doing things for God.
[2798.48 → 2802.48] Or if we're just looking to Jesus as our example.
[2802.48 → 2807.48] Or even if we are focused only on believing things about God.
[2807.48 → 2812.48] We are actually missing out on a vital part of what it means to be a Christian.
[2813.48 → 2817.48] So Jesus says that He is the vine, and we are the branches.
[2817.48 → 2820.48] And it's a reminder to us that when we come to Christ.
[2820.48 → 2825.48] And when we put our faith in Him, we're not just like voting for Him from a distance.
[2825.48 → 2829.48] But actually we are becoming joined to Him.
[2830.48 → 2832.48] And we see this throughout the New Testament.
[2832.48 → 2837.48] Like one of the most common ways the New Testament describes being a follower of Jesus.
[2837.48 → 2841.48] Is to describe us as being in Him.
[2841.48 → 2845.48] We are bound together with Christ when we put our trust in Him.
[2845.48 → 2850.48] There is a spiritual union that we have with Him.
[2850.48 → 2856.48] And that means that if we are in Christ, we are part of God's people.
[2857.48 → 2859.48] We are connected to the true vine.
[2859.48 → 2866.48] And so that brings us to kind of the final thing that I want to share from this passage this morning.
[2866.48 → 2869.48] And that is the life of the branch.
[2869.48 → 2870.48] Right?
[2870.48 → 2877.48] If Jesus is the true vine, and we are the branches, well what does it look like to be connected to Jesus?
[2877.48 → 2884.48] And the focus of this passage is to show us what it's going to be like to be connected to Jesus.
[2884.48 → 2886.48] What's involved in being a branch?
[2886.48 → 2891.48] And I just want to point out two main things that I think we see here.
[2891.48 → 2896.48] The first is what Jesus immediately gets to in verse 2.
[2896.48 → 2899.48] And that is that we are pruned.
[2899.48 → 2900.48] Okay?
[2900.48 → 2902.48] Being in Christ involves being pruned.
[2902.48 → 2907.48] So in verse 1, Jesus says, He is the vine and we are the branches.
[2907.48 → 2912.48] And then notice to that God the Father is the gardener.
[2912.48 → 2917.48] And then in the next verse, the role of the gardener, it says, is to prune.
[2918.48 → 2921.48] And actually in verse 2, it's to do two things.
[2921.48 → 2924.48] There are two things that God as the gardener is doing.
[2924.48 → 2933.48] So if we look at what Jesus says, He says, the Father as the gardener cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit.
[2933.48 → 2939.48] While every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes so that it will become even more fruitful.
[2939.48 → 2944.48] So the Father is there to cut off the branches that are fruitless.
[2944.48 → 2948.48] And to cut back the branches that are fruitful.
[2948.48 → 2953.48] Either way, friends, no branch escapes the pruning clippers.
[2953.48 → 2954.48] Right?
[2954.48 → 2961.48] Jesus doesn't give us a third option where we can kind of just check out and pretend that no one is noticing us.
[2961.48 → 2962.48] Okay?
[2962.48 → 2965.48] That's not an option in the Christian life.
[2965.48 → 2970.48] In fact, every branch gets cut.
[2970.48 → 2972.48] So some branches are cut off.
[2972.48 → 2974.48] In verse 6, Jesus says,
[2974.48 → 2979.48] If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers.
[2979.48 → 2982.48] Such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned.
[2982.48 → 2985.48] And this is a reference to the final judgment.
[2985.48 → 2994.48] Where those who are not connected with Jesus, the true vine, will remain forever not connected with Him.
[2994.48 → 2996.48] They will be separated from Him.
[2996.48 → 3000.48] You know, and we just had an example of that in John's Gospel with Judas.
[3000.48 → 3009.48] Someone who looked like they were a part of things, but was actually never truly connected to Jesus.
[3009.48 → 3014.48] But for those of us who are connected to Jesus, who are united to Him by faith,
[3014.48 → 3018.48] Jesus shows us that there will be pruning that happens.
[3018.48 → 3022.48] So at my house, we have a rose bush in the front yard.
[3022.48 → 3027.48] And when we first moved into the house, it was a really sad looking rose bush.
[3027.48 → 3036.48] So the next summer, my wife Christy found some clippers in our shed, and she went to work pruning the rose bush.
[3036.48 → 3046.48] And as I watch her do this, I always find it so shocking to see how much you actually have to cut back or cut off to actually prune a bush.
[3046.48 → 3053.48] Right? It's not like you're just snipping around the edges like you're giving it a haircut, kind of taking some off the sides and back.
[3053.48 → 3057.48] You actually have to cut deeply into the bush.
[3057.48 → 3060.48] Right? Pruning looks really cruel.
[3060.48 → 3062.48] It actually looks like you hate the bush.
[3062.48 → 3064.48] You're just like, you're going at it.
[3064.48 → 3066.48] You're hacking away.
[3066.48 → 3068.48] It looks really severe.
[3068.48 → 3070.48] You know, and it also looks kind of wasteful.
[3070.48 → 3075.48] I mean, you're cutting off good, healthy looking stuff.
[3075.48 → 3079.48] And all you're kind of left with is these short stumps.
[3079.48 → 3083.48] And you kind of say, well, you just killed it.
[3083.48 → 3084.48] What's the point of that?
[3084.48 → 3087.48] But that's actually what pruning is.
[3087.48 → 3090.48] And that, Jesus says, is part of the Christian life.
[3090.48 → 3096.48] If we are connected to Jesus and following him, Jesus says we will be pruned.
[3096.48 → 3098.48] We will be cut back.
[3098.48 → 3103.48] And just like with pruning a tree, sometimes it seems cruel.
[3103.48 → 3107.48] It might even feel that God has got it in for us.
[3107.48 → 3110.48] Like maybe God doesn't love us anymore.
[3110.48 → 3112.48] It feels very severe.
[3112.48 → 3115.48] And it may also look wasteful.
[3115.48 → 3119.48] It may look like God is actually cutting off from our lives things that are good.
[3119.48 → 3120.48] Things that are good.
[3120.48 → 3122.48] Things that we find joy in.
[3122.48 → 3123.48] Things that make us happy.
[3123.48 → 3126.48] Things that are painful to lose.
[3126.48 → 3130.48] But Jesus says that too is part of the Christian life.
[3130.48 → 3136.48] That there are times when it may feel like God is cutting deeply into our lives.
[3136.48 → 3141.48] That the blades of those cutters feel very, very sharp.
[3141.48 → 3146.48] But Jesus also wants us to know that the person who is holding those blades,
[3146.48 → 3151.48] the person doing the cutting, is very good and very loving.
[3151.48 → 3160.48] He is our Father in Heaven who is working in our lives and cultivating his vine so that we would flourish.
[3160.48 → 3166.48] And so we've seen that remaining in Jesus involves being pruned.
[3166.48 → 3171.48] But he shows us next that it also involves being fruitful.
[3171.48 → 3179.48] See, because pruning, though it is very painful, Jesus shows it that it's always going to be worth it.
[3179.48 → 3181.48] Jesus says in verse 2,
[3181.48 → 3189.48] Every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes, he cultivates, so that it will be even more fruitful.
[3189.48 → 3194.48] And I think if you've been a Christian for any length of time, you know that.
[3194.48 → 3201.48] It's often the times in our lives that we felt were most severe, most painful,
[3201.48 → 3206.48] are the times when we have actually drawn closer to God.
[3206.48 → 3214.48] They're the times when we actually bear fruit for him, or we grow in the Christian life.
[3214.48 → 3221.48] And also, my wife Christy, not only is she good at hacking at plants, pruning,
[3221.48 → 3223.48] she's also very good at growing them.
[3223.48 → 3233.48] We have a huge Monster plant in our house that she's actually even taken leaves off of and planted them,
[3233.48 → 3235.48] and now we have lots of Monster plants.
[3235.48 → 3237.48] And they're all growing and thriving.
[3237.48 → 3244.48] So I asked her for a plant that I can bring to my office here at the church.
[3244.48 → 3248.48] So she gave me one, but I forgot to water it for a few weeks.
[3248.48 → 3254.48] And one day I noticed that instead of a green plant, I had a brown, kind of yellow plant.
[3254.48 → 3261.48] Well, now I'm on my third plant, and I am actually very proud to report that it's doing okay.
[3261.48 → 3267.48] And I do water it actually every Sunday afternoon after our service, after everyone's gone.
[3267.48 → 3270.48] The last thing I do before I leave is I water my plant.
[3270.48 → 3275.48] This is all to say that I am not that great with plants.
[3275.48 → 3277.48] I forget to take care of them.
[3277.48 → 3282.48] They don't tend to have a long life expectancy under my care.
[3282.48 → 3287.48] But when it comes to God, our Heavenly Father, that is not the case.
[3287.48 → 3289.48] He is an expert gardener.
[3289.48 → 3294.48] When it comes to us, God knows exactly what He is doing in His care for us.
[3294.48 → 3298.48] He has a green thumb when it comes to His people.
[3298.48 → 3301.48] So with God tending us, you know, the question might be,
[3301.48 → 3304.48] well, what does it look like to bear fruit in the Christian life?
[3304.48 → 3308.48] And actually, Jesus doesn't really tell us exactly what it means.
[3308.48 → 3311.48] Some commentators say, well, it's talking about the fruits of the Spirit,
[3311.48 → 3314.48] like love, joy, patience, peace, and all those.
[3314.48 → 3323.48] Some talk about it kind of as evangelistic fruit of, you know, having people come through us to know God.
[3323.48 → 3325.48] And I think the answer is yes.
[3325.48 → 3328.48] I think it's all of those things.
[3328.48 → 3333.48] So that a person who is producing spiritual fruit will be growing in patience.
[3333.48 → 3336.48] Right? They will be becoming less envious of other people.
[3336.48 → 3341.48] Maybe they will be fighting lust and other temptations in their life.
[3341.48 → 3348.48] You know, a person who is producing fruit will be growing in love for difficult people.
[3348.48 → 3356.48] They'll be becoming maybe increasingly just have this foundation of joy in their lives despite the circumstances.
[3356.48 → 3358.48] And so on.
[3358.48 → 3365.48] Right? Basically, it's the whole of life brought in line with who Jesus is.
[3365.48 → 3369.48] Where your life is shaped by Jesus more and more to be like his life.
[3369.48 → 3374.48] You become to resemble Jesus, maybe kind of like a bonsai tree.
[3374.48 → 3379.48] Where you are just kind of snipping around the edges, and you're being shaped in a certain way.
[3379.48 → 3390.48] Where basically in your thoughts, in your words, in your hands, everything you do is becoming more and more like the vine that you are attached to.
[3390.48 → 3392.48] More like your Lord Jesus.
[3392.48 → 3397.48] And Jesus says, if you remain in him, fruit will come.
[3397.48 → 3399.48] And it's actually a wonderful promise.
[3399.48 → 3403.48] That if we keep on remaining in him and trusting in him,
[3403.48 → 3407.48] Jesus says we will bear fruit.
[3407.48 → 3413.48] Right? Not just that we might or that we have the potential to if we do things right.
[3413.48 → 3415.48] Jesus says we will.
[3415.48 → 3419.48] So if you look at verse 5, he says, I am the vine, you are the branches.
[3419.48 → 3424.48] If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[3424.48 → 3425.48] That's a promise.
[3425.48 → 3431.48] And then in verse 16 that we didn't read, but further on in the chapter, Jesus says,
[3431.48 → 3437.48] You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit.
[3437.48 → 3439.48] Fruit that will last.
[3441.48 → 3447.48] Sometimes in our bearing of fruit in our own lives, it comes in large jumps and leaps.
[3447.48 → 3456.48] Right? Maybe like a toddler taking a first step where suddenly they make this big growth in their abilities.
[3456.48 → 3459.48] And now they're kind of cruising around everywhere.
[3459.48 → 3466.48] Other times fruit kind of seems to come like a tree adding one more ring to its trunk.
[3466.48 → 3471.48] Where it seems like maybe nothing is happening, but when we look back on our lives, we can look and say,
[3471.48 → 3476.48] Look how I've grown. Look at what God has done in my life.
[3476.48 → 3479.48] Even if you can't see it at the moment.
[3479.48 → 3483.48] So friends, over time, you will become more fruitful.
[3483.48 → 3485.48] You will become more gracious.
[3485.48 → 3488.48] You will become more joyful in Christ.
[3488.48 → 3495.48] And it is a wonderful prospect that not only are we united to Christ by faith,
[3495.48 → 3498.48] and that happens when we first put our faith in him,
[3498.48 → 3502.48] but all along with the presence of God's Spirit in us, he sanctifies us.
[3502.48 → 3506.48] He shapes us, and we grow in him.
[3506.48 → 3509.48] But we won't get there without the pruning.
[3509.48 → 3512.48] We can't just skip to the fruitfulness part.
[3513.48 → 3520.48] And so when we do go through those seasons of particular pain where we are cut back,
[3520.48 → 3524.48] as we all will be, because he says we will,
[3524.48 → 3527.48] it's good for us to remember that we are being pruned.
[3527.48 → 3534.48] That our good and loving Father is at work in us, and that he will produce his fruit in us.
[3534.48 → 3540.48] And friends, I want us to remember again where Jesus is when he is saying these things.
[3540.48 → 3543.48] Remember, it's the night before he's crucified.
[3543.48 → 3548.48] In a matter of moments, Jesus is going to be betrayed.
[3548.48 → 3552.48] In a matter of hours, he will be hanging on a cross.
[3552.48 → 3558.48] In other words, Jesus himself, even though he is the true vine of Israel,
[3559.48 → 3564.48] who is bearing all of this good fruit, he's going to be cut off from the Father.
[3565.48 → 3567.48] Jesus himself is about to wither.
[3567.48 → 3574.48] He's about to be picked up and thrown into the fire of God's judgment for our sin.
[3574.48 → 3575.48] Right?
[3575.48 → 3583.48] Jesus is going to be cut off so that in being united to him, we will only be cultivated and cut back
[3583.48 → 3587.48] so that being connected to him, we might be fruitful in him.
[3588.48 → 3595.48] Friends, if Jesus, if you are connected to him, if you are remaining in him and he in you,
[3595.48 → 3598.48] he is producing fruit in your life.
[3598.48 → 3603.48] You are a branch that will bear much fruit to his glory.
[3603.48 → 3608.48] So let's pray that God would do that work in us and that he would help us.
[3608.48 → 3610.48] Let's pray together.
[3610.48 → 3614.48] Father, we do ask that you would do your work in us.
[3614.48 → 3623.48] Lord, it's a scary prayer to say because you promised you will answer that prayer.
[3623.48 → 3632.48] So, Father, we do, knowing that you are good, knowing that you love us, place ourselves in your hands.
[3632.48 → 3633.48] We are your branches.
[3633.48 → 3637.48] We don't belong to ourselves, but we belong to you.
[3637.48 → 3644.48] And Lord, would you do what you're meant to do, to make us who we're meant to be, which is to produce fruit for you,
[3644.48 → 3647.48] to your glory and for the good of the world.
[3647.48 → 3649.48] Would you do that in us?
[3649.48 → 3650.48] Would you make us fruitful?
[3650.48 → 3651.48] We pray in Jesus name.
[3651.48 → 3652.48] Amen.
[3652.48 → 3657.48] So we will sing our song of response.
[3657.48 → 3658.48] Then he is come upon us.
[3662.48 → 3664.48] Nutley our dream.
[3664.48 → 3666.48] O Vii is who cast as a song of song.
[3666.48 → 3668.48] Scripture will be with us.
[3668.48 → 3670.48] On the one we once in him, let's pray and make us into our faithful future.
[3670.48 → 3671.48] We must do better.
[3671.48 → 3673.48] We must pray in this action in the secret grave of peace and hope.
[3673.48 → 3675.48] Let us pray out the several divine faiths and prayer weights.
[3675.48 → 3679.48] And the Holy Father prays rose away in our Transferring of кан making our cinnamon Alexander.
[3679.48 → 3681.48] Amen.
[3709.48 → 3711.48] Amen.
[3739.48 → 3741.48] Amen.
[3769.48 → 3771.48] Amen.
[3799.48 → 3801.48] Amen.
[3829.48 → 3831.48] Amen.
[3859.48 → 3861.48] Amen.
[3889.48 → 3891.48] Amen.
[3891.48 → 3893.48] Amen.
[3893.48 → 3895.48] Amen.
[3895.48 → 3897.48] Amen.
[3897.48 → 3899.48] Amen.
[3899.48 → 3901.48] Amen.
[3901.48 → 3903.48] Amen.
[3903.48 → 3913.48] So friends, we come now to the time when we celebrate the Lord's table in communion.
[3913.48 → 3921.48] And so actually this very word communion is very much about what we just looked at in John chapter 15,
[3921.48 → 3927.48] where we have communion, that we remain, we abide in Christ through faith in Him.
[3927.48 → 3930.48] And so that's why this meal is for Christians.
[3930.48 → 3936.48] And so if this morning, and you're watching this, if you are not yet a follower of Christ,
[3936.48 → 3941.48] if you have not yet been connected with Jesus as the true vine,
[3941.48 → 3948.48] if you have not therefore also been baptized as a sign of being the people of God,
[3948.48 → 3951.48] then this table is not yet for you.
[3951.48 → 3954.48] But if you, through faith, are connected to Christ,
[3954.48 → 3961.48] and if you seek the strength, the sap of Jesus to nourish you and to help you grow in this life,
[3961.48 → 3967.48] then this table is for you and Jesus does invite you to feed on Him by faith.
[3967.48 → 3972.48] So hear now these words from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians.
[3972.48 → 3978.48] Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, He took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it,
[3978.48 → 3982.48] and said, this is my body, which is for you.
[3982.48 → 3985.48] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3985.48 → 3989.48] In the same way also, He took the cup after supper, saying,
[3989.48 → 3992.48] this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[3992.48 → 3996.48] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[3996.48 → 4006.48] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again.
[4006.48 → 4014.48] Friends, would you prepare, wherever you are, your bread and your wine?
[4014.48 → 4018.48] And let's prepare to eat together.
[4020.48 → 4027.48] So I invite you now to take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you.
[4027.48 → 4048.48] Now let's take the cup.
[4048.48 → 4055.48] Take, drink, remember, and proclaim that Jesus is coming again.
[4055.48 → 4058.48] Let's drink it together.
[4062.48 → 4067.48] Would you pray with me now? Let's pray together.
[4067.48 → 4081.48] Father, we thank you again that you, on the cross, died in our place, that the vine spilled out its life,
[4082.48 → 4086.48] that the body was broken so that we could feed on Him.
[4087.48 → 4091.48] Father, we thank you that through Christ that we can be connected with our Heavenly Father
[4091.48 → 4093.48] and that He could be our gardener.
[4093.48 → 4099.48] We thank you that we now can remain in Jesus, not only today on Sundays,
[4099.48 → 4107.48] but even each day that we live in every place that you send us, that we could bear fruit for you.
[4107.48 → 4113.48] Lord, thank you for feeding us by your grace, reminding us who we are in you.
[4113.48 → 4116.48] And Lord, by your Spirit, would you continue to work in our lives?
[4116.48 → 4119.48] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4123.48 → 4135.48] So now let's also, having been fed by Christ, let's come before Him in another prayer, a prayer for our community.
[4135.48 → 4143.48] And a couple of things we're going to pray for are those in our church community who are struggling now with cancer.
[4143.48 → 4151.48] And a former member of our congregation, Bill Van Toll, was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer.
[4151.48 → 4155.48] And he is already receiving care at Abbotsford Hospital.
[4155.48 → 4163.48] So please pray for Bill, his wife Henry also, and their immediate and extended family.
[4163.48 → 4168.48] And let's pray for God's abiding presence and His comfort for them during this difficult time.
[4168.48 → 4175.48] Family members are permitted to visit under strict COVID protocols, but only by appointment.
[4175.48 → 4180.48] And so let's pray for Bill, we'll also continue to pray for Kim.
[4180.48 → 4187.48] Also, Jake informed me that his mother Annie also had a recurrence of cancer
[4187.48 → 4194.48] and that she is also being seen by doctors to evaluate, you know, how to continue treatment for her.
[4194.48 → 4199.48] We also think of Joan, John Ram and John Van Toll.
[4199.48 → 4206.48] And so let's bring all of these requests to our Heavenly Father together.
[4206.48 → 4212.48] Father, we are your children and need you.
[4212.48 → 4214.48] Father, we need your presence.
[4214.48 → 4219.48] You have promised that you will never leave us nor forsake us.
[4219.48 → 4224.48] But much of the time we live as if we forget that you are actually here.
[4224.48 → 4233.48] Father, because we are worried, we are anxious, we live as orphans, even though we have a good and loving Father.
[4233.48 → 4239.48] And Father, whether because of the pressures of this world, the pressures of the idols of the age,
[4239.48 → 4244.48] and the teachings of our culture, they make us feel as if we are alone.
[4244.48 → 4248.48] And it makes it hard to remain connected to you.
[4248.48 → 4261.48] So, Father, we cry out to you when we look at our situations, and we ask, Lord, how long before you intervene in our lives and make all things well?
[4261.48 → 4267.48] And Father, to that you reply to us, be still.
[4267.48 → 4270.48] And you comfort us with your love.
[4270.48 → 4272.48] You comfort us with your word.
[4272.48 → 4274.48] You comfort us with your Holy Spirit.
[4274.48 → 4278.48] And you comfort us with the presence of others.
[4278.48 → 4283.48] Even in the ways that we can, in some ways, stay connected with each other.
[4283.48 → 4290.48] Father, we ask that you would give us, your children, the grace to be able to see what you are doing.
[4290.48 → 4294.48] To be able to know that you are looking upon us.
[4294.48 → 4298.48] That you are here in our lives with us.
[4298.48 → 4302.48] And that we would know your love for us and your care for us.
[4302.48 → 4308.48] So, Father, knowing that, that you are present, that you see us, that you care for us.
[4308.48 → 4311.48] Father, there are many things that we need.
[4311.48 → 4317.48] We bring before you those who need your healing, your healing physically.
[4317.48 → 4320.48] Whether from COVID or from cancer.
[4320.48 → 4324.48] Lord, we pray especially for those we've mentioned already.
[4324.48 → 4331.48] For Kim, for both Johns, for Bill, for Joan, for Annie.
[4331.48 → 4336.48] Lord, we pray that you would be with them.
[4336.48 → 4340.48] Lord, that you would be at work in their lives.
[4340.48 → 4343.48] In that work, you would come with your grace.
[4343.48 → 4345.48] Your healing presence.
[4345.48 → 4350.48] Lord, be with doctors who are attending to them and nurses.
[4350.48 → 4354.48] And Lord, would you also strengthen the families.
[4354.48 → 4358.48] Father, we also need emotional healing.
[4358.48 → 4361.48] We also need relational healing.
[4361.48 → 4365.48] So, Father, in these places also where we are needy.
[4365.48 → 4369.48] Teach us by the power of your spirit to know that you are looking upon us.
[4369.48 → 4375.48] And that we can move into these situations as your children.
[4375.48 → 4379.48] We do not need to turn to the idols of our age.
[4379.48 → 4381.48] We can turn to you.
[4381.48 → 4386.48] Lord, we also pray for the needs of this world.
[4386.48 → 4396.48] There are many areas where, just like Israel, when they are not being fruitful, that there is unrighteousness and there is injustice in the land.
[4396.48 → 4400.48] Lord, the world cries out, Lord, for healing.
[4400.48 → 4406.48] People you created in your image need food and healing and shelter.
[4406.48 → 4409.48] And Lord, there is inequality.
[4409.48 → 4413.48] There are systemic problems.
[4413.48 → 4416.48] Lord, help us to look to you.
[4416.48 → 4420.48] Help us not, Lord, when we read the news to despair.
[4420.48 → 4423.48] Help us not to be apathetic.
[4423.48 → 4430.48] But help us to engage where we can with the strength and power and wisdom that only comes from you.
[4430.48 → 4435.48] Lord, you asked us to be fruitful in particular times and places where you put us.
[4435.48 → 4438.48] Lord, help us to be faithful to you in those places.
[4438.48 → 4446.48] And so, Lord, we ask again that you would come to us and remain in us.
[4446.48 → 4451.48] Help us to remain in you and bear much fruit for your glory and for the good of this world again, we pray.
[4451.48 → 4461.48] In the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour, our vine, we pray. Amen.
[4461.48 → 4464.48] So now, friends, we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4464.48 → 4468.48] The blessing, this good word that he is with us.
[4468.48 → 4470.48] That he does care for us.
[4470.48 → 4474.48] That he promises that in our lives he will be at work.
[4474.48 → 4481.48] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of openness to receive your Father's blessing upon you.
[4481.48 → 4490.48] Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy.
[4490.48 → 4499.48] To the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time.
[4499.48 → 4502.48] And now and forevermore.
[4502.48 → 4503.48] Amen.
[4504.48 → 4533.48] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are worthy.
[4533.48 → 4537.48] Indium, King of Kings, Mr.an Erich, the greater seated, ua ma'am within you.
[4537.48 → 4538.48] Brother, King of Kings, and he is blessed, the greater Wars of America.
[4538.48 → 4539.48] And now and forevermore.

[4541.48 → 4542.48] We both love you, Brother, and Que Grace, King of Kings.
[4542.48 → 4544.48] Jesus Christ, our King of Kings greater than yours, thank you with your God's blessedness and blessedness.
[4544.48 → 4546.48] ету To Him will once more worship yourself and blessedness and blessedness and blessedness,
[4546.48 → 4550.48] God of Kings.
[4550.48 → 4555.48] And you, Jesus Christ, our Holy 아�時候 gifts, our Jesus Christ, our Lord who has helped us understand you.
[4555.48 → 4557.60] And, for you our blood of Judas, faith, our love you, the greaterенный of dorm it,
[4557.60 → 4558.48] and the joy state and falsehood of Jerusalem.
[4558.48 → 4559.48] And the Book of Jesus Christ, our children and Juan are given you who's broken until.
[4563.48 → 4568.14] Praise the Spirit, every one.
[4568.14 → 4572.40] Praise the King of glory.
[4573.40 → 4577.28] Praise Him for eternity.
[4579.14 → 4583.32] Praise the King of glory.
[4584.46 → 4588.88] Praise Him for eternity.
[4593.48 → 4608.40] Praised for the King of glory.
[4608.40 → 4612.60] Praise Him for eternity.
[4613.14 → 4619.28] Praise Him for eternity.
