[0.00 → 13.32] .
[13.32 → 17.66] .
[17.66 → 29.78] .
[29.78 → 30.78] Amen.
[59.78 → 61.78] Amen.
[89.78 → 91.78] Amen.
[119.78 → 121.78] Amen.
[149.78 → 151.78] Amen.
[179.78 → 181.78] Amen.
[209.78 → 211.78] Amen.
[239.78 → 241.78] Amen.
[269.78 → 271.78] Amen.
[299.78 → 301.78] Amen.
[301.78 → 314.78] Well, good morning, everyone.
[314.78 → 318.78] And welcome, of course, to Loner Christ Reformed Church.
[318.78 → 321.78] And a special welcome if you're visiting with us today.
[321.78 → 327.78] We're certainly blessed by everyone's presence among us this morning.
[327.78 → 336.78] As usual these days, we won't be passing a collection plate during our service, but we do have a cause we're supporting through any offerings that we're giving today.
[336.78 → 339.78] And that one this week is Night Shift Ministries.
[339.78 → 353.78] This is a ministry that offers meals, clothing, crisis counselling, basic nursing, mobile library prayer, and loving community contact at their locations in both Surrey and Langley.
[353.78 → 355.78] So very local, very relevant.
[355.78 → 364.78] And, yeah, if you'd like to donate, there's a donation box in the foyer or various online ways of doing that if you're so inclined to do that.
[364.78 → 370.78] At this point, Elaine has a yeah, Elaine has an announcement about cross-training.
[370.78 → 371.78] Good morning.
[371.78 → 372.78] Good morning.
[372.78 → 385.78] I'm sure that all of you have seen this brochure for cross-training already.
[385.78 → 404.78] And if you haven't, don't have one, there's more in the foyer on the oval table along with the sign-up sheet.
[404.78 → 405.78] Okay.
[405.78 → 415.78] Well, the committee is excited this time to offer a course on beauty, art, and the kingdom.
[415.78 → 424.78] Now, with Marian's leadership, we'll be talking about our perceptions of beauty, how art relates to justice,
[424.78 → 427.78] how we can use art in worship,
[427.78 → 430.78] and what we have to watch out for
[430.78 → 433.78] in using art in each of these areas.
[433.78 → 437.78] We'll discuss what beauty's role is in the kingdom,
[437.78 → 440.78] and how we can be good stewards of beauty.
[440.78 → 444.78] Cross training starts at 9.30 next Sunday morning
[444.78 → 447.78] in the fellowship hall.
[447.78 → 449.78] I encourage each of you to attend and participate
[449.78 → 454.78] in this engaging topic, beauty, art, and the kingdom.
[454.78 → 460.78] And also, one more announcement I was just quickly asked to make, too,
[460.78 → 463.78] and that has to do with the announcement in the bulletin
[463.78 → 467.78] about this new midweek adult fellowship and Bible study.
[467.78 → 470.78] I don't know if you've noticed it yet or not,
[470.78 → 474.78] but Wednesday morning's traditionally been a time
[474.78 → 477.78] for the women's coffee break meeting time.
[477.78 → 481.78] So with this time, we're going to change the name,
[481.78 → 483.78] but this isn't going to be the formal name.
[483.78 → 485.78] This is just the name for now.
[485.78 → 488.78] Midweek adult Bible study and fellowship.
[488.78 → 493.78] And this will be for men and women, English and Chinese speaking.
[493.78 → 497.78] So we will meet about 9.30 approximately,
[497.78 → 502.78] just for an informal social time with coffee.
[502.78 → 504.78] At this time, bring your own coffee or tea,
[504.78 → 506.78] but hopefully we'll have coffee and goodies later on.
[506.78 → 509.78] We can share when that comes up.
[509.78 → 514.78] And then at 10 o'clock, we'll break up into our respective classes.
[514.78 → 518.78] We'll have a men's Bible study and a women's Bible study.
[518.78 → 522.78] So it would be wonderful if we could have lots of people join us there
[522.78 → 526.78] for this midweek adult fellowship and Bible study.
[526.78 → 527.78] Thank you.
[527.78 → 540.78] Okay. Thanks, Elaine.
[540.78 → 543.78] And if the changing weather wasn't a clue for you,
[543.78 → 547.78] then the plethora of sign-up sheets in the lobby should tell you that summer's over.
[547.78 → 549.78] Right? We're in fall.
[549.78 → 553.78] You know, in addition to the cross-training sign-up sheets,
[553.78 → 558.78] we do have sign-up sheets for anybody that's interested in doing scripture readings during the service.
[558.78 → 559.78] Very worthwhile.
[559.78 → 562.78] Good to be up here and share in that.
[562.78 → 564.78] Also, if you're interested in being a Sunday school teacher,
[564.78 → 566.78] there's a sign-up sheet for that.
[566.78 → 568.78] And, well, probably other ones too.
[568.78 → 569.78] I don't know.
[569.78 → 570.78] I didn't see any other ones.
[570.78 → 571.78] Do I have any other ones I've got to talk about?
[571.78 → 572.78] That's good.
[572.78 → 574.78] Got the thumbs-up from Pastor Jason.
[574.78 → 577.78] And a couple other things of note before we begin our service.
[577.78 → 583.78] On September 25th, we'll be starting an art exhibition that'll be in the foyer
[583.78 → 585.78] from local Vancouver artists.
[585.78 → 588.78] And that's themed around the beauty of creation.
[588.78 → 590.78] So that's something you definitely just want to take in.
[590.78 → 592.78] You know, there's no obligation.
[592.78 → 594.78] You don't have to spend any money on it.
[594.78 → 598.78] But just to take in some of the work of some of these local artists would be worthwhile.
[598.78 → 605.78] And then October 2nd, we're blessed by having an evening of music, worship,
[605.78 → 608.78] and testimony led by Esther Ha.
[608.78 → 615.78] And she is a very well-known Chinese classical music singer.
[615.78 → 619.78] And so she'll be leading us in an evening of music and testimony, as I said.
[619.78 → 622.78] And that should be a very good event to attend as well.
[622.78 → 627.78] I think that's it for announcements.
[627.78 → 636.78] So God greets us this morning and calls us to worship him with these words from Revelation 15.
[636.78 → 640.78] Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty.
[640.78 → 644.78] Just and true are your ways, King of the ages.
[644.78 → 648.78] Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name?
[648.78 → 651.78] For you alone are holy.
[651.78 → 654.78] All nations will come and worship you.
[654.78 → 659.78] And now our praise team will invite them forward, and they'll lead us in three songs.
[659.78 → 668.78] Lord, our Lord, your glorious name.
[668.78 → 672.78] All your wondrous works proclaim.
[672.78 → 690.78] In the heavens with radiant signs,
[690.78 → 695.78] Health of all your glorious signs,
[695.78 → 699.78] Have great your name.
[699.78 → 704.78] Lord, our Lord, and all the earth,
[704.78 → 708.78] Have great your name.
[708.78 → 713.78] Yours the name of matchless world,
[713.78 → 717.78] Excellent in all the earth,

[727.78 → 732.78] Lightly tell the papers light.
[732.78 → 735.78] When I blew the heavens apart,
[735.78 → 737.78] When I blew the heavens apart,
[737.78 → 742.78] When I know the snow we are,
[742.78 → 747.78] I'll grant your name.
[747.78 → 752.78] Lord, our Lord, and all the earth,
[752.78 → 757.78] I'll grant your name.
[757.78 → 761.78] Yours the name of matchless world,
[761.78 → 766.78] Excellent in all the earth,
[766.78 → 772.78] I'll grant your name.
[772.78 → 777.78] Who are we that we should share,
[777.78 → 782.78] In your love and tender care,
[782.78 → 787.78] Rage to an exalted light,
[787.78 → 791.78] Round with honour in your sight,
[791.78 → 796.78] How great your name.

[801.78 → 806.78] How great your name.
[806.78 → 811.78] Yours the name of matchless world,
[811.78 → 815.78] Excellent in all the earth,
[815.78 → 820.78] How great your name.
[831.78 → 834.78] Jaw, what great real name.
[837.78 → 840.78] Local en royalty and high.
[840.78 → 843.78] Wilt your man and glad you stand,
[843.78 → 845.78] Over the riches of your heaven,
[845.78 → 850.78] After her source and thanks will get,
[850.78 → 852.78] With your weary bum and travails,
[852.78 → 853.78] CHANG,
[853.78 → 856.78] In a sea and form that will blow,

[1271.78 → 1275.56] I surrender all.
[1276.24 → 1282.08] All to the Lord, Lord of the Saviour,
[1282.88 → 1287.52] I surrender all.
[1287.52 → 1302.70] Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1306.28 → 1309.30] Lord, we have not kept watch for you.
[1309.94 → 1312.54] We have occupied ourselves with our own concerns.
[1313.44 → 1316.04] We have not waited to find your will for us.
[1316.04 → 1319.60] We have not noticed the needs of the people around us.
[1320.10 → 1323.54] We have not acknowledged love that has been shown to us.
[1324.64 → 1326.42] Forgive us for our lack of watchfulness.
[1327.40 → 1329.50] Help us to wait to know your will.
[1330.66 → 1333.06] Help us to look out for the needs of others.
[1334.42 → 1337.10] Help us to work and watch for your coming.
[1337.88 → 1338.14] Amen.
[1340.06 → 1343.62] Our confidence as Christians is that in Christ,
[1343.62 → 1345.56] we do have forgiveness of sins.
[1346.04 → 1351.00] And we're reminded of that this morning with these words based on Jeremiah 33.
[1351.00 → 1354.88] The days are surely coming, says the Lord,
[1355.10 → 1359.80] when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
[1360.52 → 1362.42] In those days and at that time,
[1362.48 → 1364.92] I will cause a righteous branch to spring up for David,
[1365.28 → 1368.60] and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
[1369.34 → 1373.64] In those days, Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety.
[1373.64 → 1376.68] And this is the name by which it will be called,
[1377.20 → 1378.86] the Lord is our righteousness.
[1379.52 → 1384.62] People of God, Jesus Christ, our Lord, is our righteousness.
[1385.34 → 1387.66] In Christ, we are made right with God.
[1388.14 → 1389.40] Thanks be to God.
[1390.78 → 1392.74] Let's celebrate our Lord by singing,
[1393.20 → 1395.00] I know not why God's run is grace.
[1395.00 → 1396.10] And after that,
[1396.20 → 1401.34] the children aged three through grade seven are welcome to go to kids' life classes.
[1401.34 → 1425.40] I know not why God's wondrous place,
[1425.40 → 1430.40] to me, it has become.
[1430.40 → 1434.40] Our Lord, unworthy,
[1435.12 → 1437.28] our still love,
[1437.42 → 1442.40] redeeming for its own.
[1443.40 → 1446.40] Our Lord, unworthy,
[1446.40 → 1449.40] our still love,
[1449.40 → 1454.40] redeeming for its own.
[1454.40 → 1468.10] Our Lord,
[1468.10 → 1473.40] And the others,

[1521.90 → 1527.90] I know not how the Spirit moves,
[1527.90 → 1533.90] Convincing us of sin.
[1533.90 → 1539.90] Revealing Jesus through the way,
[1539.90 → 1545.90] Creating faith in Him.
[1545.90 → 1551.90] But I know not how I've believed,
[1551.90 → 1558.90] And am persuaded that He is able.
[1558.90 → 1564.90] To keep love which I permitted,
[1564.90 → 1570.90] Unto Him against the dead.
[1570.90 → 1573.90] To hear them which I Switzerland

[1617.90 → 1619.90] Amen.
[1647.90 → 1649.90] Amen.
[1677.90 → 1679.90] Amen.
[1705.90 → 1706.90] Psalm 130.
[1707.90 → 1709.90] A Song of Ascents.
[1709.90 → 1712.90] Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord.
[1712.90 → 1714.90] Lord, hear my voice.
[1714.90 → 1718.90] Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
[1718.90 → 1723.90] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[1723.90 → 1730.90] But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
[1730.90 → 1736.90] I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
[1736.90 → 1738.90] I wait for the Lord.
[1738.90 → 1741.90] More than watchmen, wait for the morning.
[1741.90 → 1744.90] More than watchmen, wait for the morning.
[1744.90 → 1747.90] Israel, put your hope in the Lord.
[1747.90 → 1753.90] For with the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption.
[1753.90 → 1758.90] He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[1758.90 → 1761.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[1761.90 → 1763.90] Thanks be to God.
[1763.90 → 1773.90] So, good morning.
[1773.90 → 1775.90] It's great to be with you all.
[1775.90 → 1782.90] So, as many of you will know, we are still in our sermon series that we started in the summer.
[1782.90 → 1785.90] And we'll continue in only a couple more weeks.
[1786.90 → 1789.90] And it's a series we're calling Songs for the Journey.
[1789.90 → 1797.90] And what we're doing is we're looking at a small collection of psalms within the Psalter.
[1797.90 → 1802.90] And it's a collection of psalms called the Psalms of Ascent.
[1802.90 → 1812.90] And these are the songs that God's people would sing as they made their way up to the city of Jerusalem several times each year for the great annual feast.
[1812.90 → 1820.90] And what we're doing as we're preaching through these psalms is we're reminding ourselves that we too are on a journey.
[1820.90 → 1830.90] Okay, we too are pilgrims making our way through this life to the heavenly city as we follow our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[1830.90 → 1836.90] And so today, as was read for us, we're looking at Psalm 130, and we're calling it the Song of Hope.
[1836.90 → 1845.90] So first I want to point out one of the interesting things about the Psalms of Ascent is that there are 15 of them.
[1845.90 → 1847.90] Psalm 120 to 134.
[1847.90 → 1852.90] And the first one, Psalm 120, which we looked at many, many weeks ago.
[1852.90 → 1858.90] The psalmist starts off, and if you remember, he's saying, Lord, I need help.
[1858.90 → 1865.90] I need help because there is brokenness and there is evil all around me.
[1865.90 → 1880.90] But now, in Psalm 130, ten psalms later, the psalmist starts to say, Lord, I need help because there is brokenness and there is evil in me.
[1880.90 → 1890.90] So he goes from saying the problems are out there to acknowledging that there are problems in here, in our hearts.
[1890.90 → 1897.90] And so Psalm 130 is different because it's less about this external journey that we're all on,
[1897.90 → 1900.90] and it's more about an internal journey.
[1900.90 → 1907.90] An internal journey from the depths of sin to the heights of hope and forgiveness.
[1907.90 → 1913.90] And so our psalm today addresses this brokenness and the sin that we all have,
[1913.90 → 1923.90] but it offers us the hope and redemption prepared for us in Christ that we simply open our hands to receive,
[1923.90 → 1926.90] that it has been prepared for us.
[1926.90 → 1931.90] So let me pray, and then let's dive into this passage together.
[1931.90 → 1938.90] Father, we come before you as your children, those whom you have purchased and love.
[1938.90 → 1945.90] And Lord, we ask that you would draw us close to yourself through your word, which is true and good,
[1945.90 → 1955.90] and that you have spoken to us long ago and that your people have always listened to and sought because we know it is true.
[1955.90 → 1957.90] Lord, would you speak to us this morning?
[1957.90 → 1963.90] Help us to know how we can walk on this pilgrim journey of faith following you.
[1963.90 → 1965.90] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1965.90 → 1971.90] So, like, two weeks ago, it seemed like summer was just over, right?
[1971.90 → 1974.90] So I think it's technically still summer, but you couldn't tell.
[1974.90 → 1979.90] Just all of a sudden, the weather, like it was this windstorm, the wind blew in, blew summer right out,
[1979.90 → 1981.90] and now it kind of feels like fall.
[1981.90 → 1988.90] But before we move on to the fall, I still need to use one sermon illustration from the summer before it's too late.
[1988.90 → 1992.90] So, how many of you went camping this summer?
[1992.90 → 1994.90] I know a bunch of you.
[1994.90 → 1996.90] How many of you have ever gone camping?
[1996.90 → 1998.90] Hopefully, okay.
[1998.90 → 2003.90] How many of you have ever gone camping and slept in a tent?
[2003.90 → 2004.90] Okay, good.
[2004.90 → 2006.90] So it's not just me.
[2006.90 → 2010.90] So, our family, we love to go camping.
[2010.90 → 2015.90] And one of the great things about camping, of course, is you get to sleep in a tent.
[2015.90 → 2018.90] Well, it's great until you hit the age of 40.
[2018.90 → 2019.90] So now, I'm 41.
[2019.90 → 2020.90] It's not as great.
[2020.90 → 2022.90] But still, you're outside.
[2022.90 → 2024.90] You're in nature.
[2024.90 → 2028.90] You're under the skies, the wind, the breeze, the trees, the dirt, the moss.
[2028.90 → 2030.90] You're just, you know, out in God's creation.
[2030.90 → 2032.90] And it's restoring, right?
[2032.90 → 2036.90] Now, but the bad thing, of course, is its uncomfortable.
[2036.90 → 2043.90] And so, this last trip we were on, I got this air mattress, and the thing had a hole in it.
[2043.90 → 2047.90] So, in the middle of the night, you're lying on the ground.
[2047.90 → 2051.90] And even when the air mattress works, you know, it's only like so thick.
[2051.90 → 2055.90] And so, it just kind of, you don't sleep well.
[2055.90 → 2057.90] You're tossing, and you're turning.
[2057.90 → 2059.90] Like, it seems like every half an hour, I sleep on my side.
[2059.90 → 2061.90] So, I'm this side, and then I'm on that side.
[2061.90 → 2065.90] And at some point, you're just kind of lying there, waiting for the morning to come.
[2065.90 → 2070.90] Waiting we can just get up and get out of the tent and then enjoy the day.
[2070.90 → 2075.90] So, there's this anticipation of the morning.
[2075.90 → 2079.90] This kind of restlessness that you have, waiting for the dawn.
[2079.90 → 2083.90] And similarly, these psalms of ascent were songs of anticipation.
[2083.90 → 2085.90] They were psalms of waiting.
[2085.90 → 2088.90] And they were psalms of hope.
[2088.90 → 2096.90] Of being on this long journey, then looking forward to, and finally arriving in Jerusalem to worship God.
[2096.90 → 2100.90] To be in the place where God dwells with his people.
[2100.90 → 2105.90] And in Psalm 130, we see especially this theme of anticipation.
[2105.90 → 2107.90] And this theme of hope.
[2107.90 → 2112.90] And it's contrasting the night and the day.
[2112.90 → 2116.90] And this psalm begins in the deep darkness of night.
[2116.90 → 2121.90] And yet, by the end of the psalm, we see the dawn arriving.
[2121.90 → 2124.90] We see this, the hope awakening.
[2124.90 → 2129.90] And this hope and this assurance of our relationship with God.
[2129.90 → 2131.90] But it starts in the dark of sin.
[2131.90 → 2135.90] And it ends in the light of the hope of the dawn.
[2135.90 → 2138.90] And friends, that's good news for all of us this morning.
[2138.90 → 2140.90] All of us who struggle with sin.
[2140.90 → 2144.90] And we struggle with brokenness and a sense of failure in our lives.
[2144.90 → 2151.90] And this psalm shows us how we too can move in that same journey that this psalm shows us.
[2151.90 → 2161.90] This journey from waiting in the darkness of sin to the hope and anticipation of forgiveness and mercy that comes through Christ.
[2161.90 → 2166.90] And so the main idea I want to share with you this morning is this.
[2166.90 → 2172.90] That God redeems the waiting in the night with the bright hope of the morning.
[2172.90 → 2177.90] And so let's look at this inward journey the psalmist takes.
[2177.90 → 2179.90] From anticipation to assurance.
[2179.90 → 2184.90] From grief of guilt to hope.
[2184.90 → 2186.90] From sin to forgiveness.
[2186.90 → 2191.90] And then let's look at how we also can take this journey too with the psalmist.
[2191.90 → 2195.90] And so this is kind of the two simple points I have for us this morning.
[2195.90 → 2197.90] The waiting in the night.
[2197.90 → 2199.90] And then the hope of the morning.
[2199.90 → 2202.90] Okay, so first the waiting in the night.
[2202.90 → 2203.90] This is where we begin.
[2203.90 → 2207.90] And you can see from the beginning that this person who wrote the psalm.
[2207.90 → 2209.90] You know, like last psalm we looked at.
[2209.90 → 2211.90] 131 was the psalm of David.
[2211.90 → 2212.90] This one doesn't say.
[2212.90 → 2213.90] But the psalmist.
[2213.90 → 2216.90] He who wrote this psalm.
[2216.90 → 2217.90] It begins where?
[2217.90 → 2219.90] Begins in the depths.
[2219.90 → 2222.90] Okay, so this is what it says in verse 1.
[2222.90 → 2223.90] It begins.
[2223.90 → 2224.90] Out of the depths.
[2224.90 → 2228.90] I cry to you, Lord.
[2228.90 → 2230.90] Lord, hear my voice.
[2230.90 → 2233.90] Now, of course, this is a metaphor.
[2233.90 → 2236.90] The psalmist is not literally in a pit or in a hole.
[2236.90 → 2241.90] But he is, as we might say, down in the dumps.
[2241.90 → 2245.90] I don't know if you this morning are feeling down in the dumps.
[2245.90 → 2253.90] But he's feeling this deep emotional and this deep spiritual discouragement and anguish.
[2253.90 → 2257.90] And this word depths is an interesting word.
[2257.90 → 2259.90] It's used elsewhere in the scripture.
[2259.90 → 2262.90] And it always refers to deep waters.
[2262.90 → 2268.90] And so that is the image that the people of Israel would have had when they read and saying this.
[2268.90 → 2275.90] Is that they would have this image in their mind of sinking into the depths of the waters.
[2275.90 → 2281.90] And not being able to find a foothold and feeling like there are waves crashing over your head.
[2281.90 → 2284.90] And it's a sense of fear and chaos and desperation.
[2287.90 → 2291.90] And so now the question is, why does he feel this way?
[2291.90 → 2297.90] What is the source of the psalmist's despair?
[2297.90 → 2305.90] In different psalms we've looked at, we've seen many psalms of lament and songs of crying out to God for all kinds of different reasons.
[2305.90 → 2308.90] But in this psalm there is a specific reason.
[2308.90 → 2311.90] And so look with me at verses 2 and 3.
[2311.90 → 2312.90] It says,
[2312.90 → 2328.90] So what we see here is he's not just suffering from external threats.
[2328.90 → 2334.90] From bandits in the mountains or heat or lies of his enemies or all these other things.
[2334.90 → 2339.90] But this has to do instead with his own sense of sin.
[2339.90 → 2341.90] His own sense of guilt and shame.
[2341.90 → 2349.90] And he's overwhelmed like sinking into the water by a sense of his own failure and his own mistakes.
[2349.90 → 2353.90] And as we read the Old Testament, you know, especially in the prophets,
[2353.90 → 2360.90] we get a sense of the situation that the people of God, the Israelites, were in.
[2360.90 → 2367.90] Because we see how God is constantly calling Israel out for their unfaithfulness.
[2367.90 → 2368.90] Right?
[2368.90 → 2372.90] For the idolatry of them worshipping other gods.
[2372.90 → 2383.90] Remember, they're on this journey and there are these Canaanite shrines in the hills, and they're tempted to worship and to trust in these other gods.
[2383.90 → 2391.90] And often, God has judgment on Israel because of their lack of faithfulness to worship God alone.
[2391.90 → 2400.90] And so the psalmist here is being confronted with the reality of his own sin and unfaithfulness.
[2400.90 → 2402.90] And he's crying out to God for mercy.
[2402.90 → 2407.90] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[2407.90 → 2411.90] The answer is, no one.
[2411.90 → 2418.90] If God kept a record of sins against you and me, none of us could stand.
[2418.90 → 2423.90] And so it is the spiritual darkness of sin that's in view.
[2423.90 → 2430.90] And, but we know that it's not in this, from the scriptures, it's not just Israel that has a problem with sin.
[2430.90 → 2438.90] We learn that all of humanity has rejected God's goodness and his love, and we fell into sin through Adam and Eve.
[2438.90 → 2447.90] And we have all fallen into this place where every single one of us is inclined in our hearts towards sin and darkness.
[2447.90 → 2449.90] We are all guilty before God.
[2449.90 → 2455.90] Not one of us can stand before God on our own goodness and merit.
[2456.90 → 2463.90] And so what this psalm teaches us is what we can do then with our sin and guilt.
[2463.90 → 2466.90] We all have it. What do we do with it?
[2466.90 → 2476.90] But before we look at what the psalmist says we can do with it, let's first talk about two ways that we tend to all handle our guilt that don't actually work.
[2477.90 → 2484.90] And so the first way that we, is that we, what we do, is we suppress our guilt.
[2484.90 → 2486.90] Or we deny our guilt.
[2486.90 → 2493.90] And really this is the most common way in our modern society today.
[2493.90 → 2499.90] Because we are kind of told throughout our lives that guilt is not healthy.
[2499.90 → 2501.90] Right? That guilt is toxic.
[2501.90 → 2503.90] That we shouldn't feel guilt.
[2503.90 → 2508.90] And so we handle it by just denying the reality of guilt.
[2508.90 → 2520.90] So Sigmund Freud was the first person to say that guilt is essentially a pathological disorder that is given to you by your parents, by religion, by society.
[2520.90 → 2526.90] And the healthy person, Freud said, must reject the concept of guilt and move towards self-acceptance.
[2526.90 → 2534.90] And this has pretty much become the standard doctrine that we all believe today.
[2534.90 → 2535.90] And how we deal with our guilt.
[2535.90 → 2538.90] If you're feeling guilty, it's actually, there's nothing wrong with you.
[2538.90 → 2541.90] It's just something that has been imposed upon you.
[2541.90 → 2545.90] And you have the freedom to define what is right and wrong for yourself.
[2545.90 → 2549.90] You all know what I'm talking about.
[2549.90 → 2554.90] But the problem with this is, it doesn't seem to work.
[2554.90 → 2561.90] Because even if we deny that the things that we do hurt others and hurt ourselves,
[2561.90 → 2565.90] even if we just kind of deny that and push it away,
[2565.90 → 2570.90] we still have the feeling that there is something still deeply wrong with us.
[2570.90 → 2576.90] That we are, I mean, we don't use the word sin, but that we are sinners.
[2576.90 → 2581.90] We truly do cause chaos in our own lives and the lives of other people.
[2581.90 → 2586.90] And so we feel like we're sinners, even if we deny that it's true.
[2586.90 → 2588.90] And so suppressing guilt doesn't work.
[2588.90 → 2590.90] Because guilt is real.
[2590.90 → 2592.90] Because sin is real.
[2592.90 → 2595.90] So that's one way we tend to handle our guilt.
[2595.90 → 2599.90] And the second way, another way, is we say,
[2599.90 → 2602.90] Okay, well, fine. I'm bad.
[2602.90 → 2604.90] I did this. I thought this.
[2604.90 → 2607.90] I know this is not good.
[2607.90 → 2610.90] I've really messed up here.
[2610.90 → 2614.90] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do my best to fix it.
[2614.90 → 2617.90] So we go, and we start to work.
[2617.90 → 2624.90] We try to prove ourselves, and we demonstrate that we're actually not that bad.
[2624.90 → 2629.90] We try to do great things even for God or for other people.
[2629.90 → 2631.90] To atone for our sin.
[2631.90 → 2636.90] Sometimes we even come to church with this mindset that if I worship God on Sundays,
[2636.90 → 2641.90] it will make up for all the ways that I've sinned and failed throughout the week.
[2641.90 → 2646.90] That if I am a churchgoer, that God will accept me.
[2646.90 → 2653.90] We do everything we can then to drag ourselves out of the pit.
[2653.90 → 2655.90] The depths of our sin.
[2655.90 → 2657.90] But do you know what, friends?
[2657.90 → 2659.90] That doesn't work either.
[2659.90 → 2660.90] And this is why.
[2660.90 → 2661.90] Why doesn't that work?
[2661.90 → 2665.90] Because how do you know when you're out of the pit?
[2665.90 → 2667.90] How do you know when you've done enough?
[2667.90 → 2668.90] Right?
[2668.90 → 2675.90] How do you know when you've actually proven yourself, your worth, whether to someone else or to God?
[2675.90 → 2680.90] How do you know that you finally have God's favour and that you're right with God?
[2680.90 → 2685.90] And the problem with religion without grace and without the gospel is that problem.
[2685.90 → 2687.90] How do you prove your moral record?
[2687.90 → 2688.90] You never know.
[2688.90 → 2690.90] You never know when you've arrived.
[2690.90 → 2696.90] So neither of these approaches work with how to deal with our guilt.
[2696.90 → 2698.90] Denying our guilt doesn't work.
[2698.90 → 2701.90] Pulling ourselves up out of this pit ourselves doesn't work.
[2701.90 → 2702.90] So what do we do?
[2702.90 → 2704.90] How do we deal with our guilt?
[2704.90 → 2709.90] Well, let's look at what the psalmist tells us.
[2709.90 → 2713.90] What does the psalmist do with his guilt?
[2713.90 → 2715.90] He admits it.
[2715.90 → 2717.90] That's it.
[2717.90 → 2718.90] It's simple.
[2718.90 → 2721.90] He is honest with God.
[2721.90 → 2725.90] He admits his guilt before God.
[2725.90 → 2729.90] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[2729.90 → 2735.90] It's just this honest admission and acknowledgement of his guilt before God.
[2735.90 → 2736.90] He's not denying it.
[2736.90 → 2738.90] He's not making excuses for it.
[2738.90 → 2740.90] He's not trying to fix it himself.
[2740.90 → 2747.90] He says, Lord, if you kept a record of sins, Lord, there's a record.
[2747.90 → 2748.90] There is a record.
[2748.90 → 2750.90] I have done these things.
[2750.90 → 2755.90] And because of the depths and the darkness of my sin, there's no way I can stand before a holy God.
[2755.90 → 2760.90] So what the psalm teaches us is that we can go to God with our guilt, and we can be honest with him.
[2760.90 → 2761.90] Right?
[2761.90 → 2765.90] We can be honest with God with our struggles of sin and our wrestling with sin.
[2765.90 → 2768.90] Because we are all sinners.
[2768.90 → 2770.90] So we can be honest with God.
[2770.90 → 2775.90] And that's why every week we have a time of confession.
[2775.90 → 2783.90] Because we are saying both individually and collectively that we are in the depths of sin.
[2783.90 → 2787.90] And we do it to remind ourselves that we can speak honestly to God.
[2787.90 → 2794.90] It's not that we say this confession and then God says, oh, okay, now I'll forgive you.
[2794.90 → 2801.90] God has forgiven us once and for all our sins past, present, and future because of the death of Jesus Christ.
[2801.90 → 2808.90] But in our everyday experiential relationship with God on this walk of faith, we need to come before him.
[2808.90 → 2814.90] And admit and be honest with God about the sins that we struggle with.
[2814.90 → 2822.90] And so as long as we deny it, or we try to fix it ourselves, we can't receive the good word of God's mercy and grace.
[2822.90 → 2823.90] That's the problem.
[2823.90 → 2830.90] If we're trying to fix it ourselves or if we're denying it, we're never going to turn to God for his mercy and his grace.
[2830.90 → 2834.90] But once we do, we're honest and open before God.
[2834.90 → 2840.90] We can cry out to him for what only he can provide to us, which is his mercy.
[2840.90 → 2848.90] So every one of us begins this journey of the soul in the darkness of the night because of our sin.
[2848.90 → 2855.90] And the way the psalmist shows us how to deal with our sin is to be honest with God that we need his mercy.
[2855.90 → 2857.90] Okay, so that's the first thing we see.
[2857.90 → 2859.90] That's the waiting in the darkness.
[2859.90 → 2862.90] But friends, what is the good news?
[2862.90 → 2871.90] The good news is that this psalm doesn't leave us lying on the ground on the rocks in the darkness.
[2871.90 → 2877.90] He, because what we do is we see the hope of the morning.
[2877.90 → 2878.90] Okay, we see the hope of the morning.
[2878.90 → 2880.90] That's the second thing we see.
[2880.90 → 2888.90] And so we see this picture of hopeful waiting in verses 5 and 6.
[2888.90 → 2889.90] So we'll put those up here.
[2889.90 → 2890.90] It says,
[2890.90 → 2895.90] I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits.
[2895.90 → 2898.90] Or some translation, my soul waits.
[2898.90 → 2901.90] And in his word, I put my hope.
[2901.90 → 2906.90] I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning.
[2906.90 → 2910.90] So, let's think about the watchman.
[2910.90 → 2917.90] What does someone who watches in the night, what does someone who watches for the morning do?
[2917.90 → 2919.90] What is their role?
[2919.90 → 2922.90] Well, it's a military term.
[2922.90 → 2926.90] And it's a term for someone who is watching out for danger.
[2926.90 → 2935.90] Someone who is on guard in the night, ready to sound the alarm if the enemies are attacking.
[2935.90 → 2939.90] And so with this image of the watchmen,
[2939.90 → 2946.90] first, it connects to this fear of invasion from the surrounding nations that the Israelites would have constantly felt.
[2946.90 → 2951.90] With all these other nations just bent on conquering Israel,
[2951.90 → 2956.90] they would have to have watchmen looking out for this danger constantly.
[2956.90 → 2960.90] But also, there's this idea of a personal watchman.
[2960.90 → 2967.90] Of because, you know, we have these travellers, right, on this pilgrimage, on this journey up to Jerusalem.
[2967.90 → 2969.90] And it was a dangerous road.
[2969.90 → 2970.90] Right?
[2970.90 → 2973.90] There were thieves and there were robbers on the road.
[2973.90 → 2977.90] And if you travelled in the night especially, you had to be careful.
[2977.90 → 2979.90] You had to be on guard.
[2979.90 → 2986.90] So the psalmist is saying, I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning.
[2986.90 → 2991.90] Think about how much the watchmen would wait for the morning.
[2991.90 → 2998.90] How they would just be yearning for the dawn to come and for the danger to dissipate.
[2998.90 → 3008.90] For the watchmen, there is a waiting for the dawn and a great relief in the morning when the dawn has finally come.
[3008.90 → 3013.90] And just as the watchman waits for the dawn, so the psalmist says his whole being waits for the Lord.
[3013.90 → 3017.90] It's this picture of anticipation and hope.
[3017.90 → 3022.90] It's this image of waiting for salvation to come.
[3022.90 → 3025.90] And why is he waiting for the Lord?
[3025.90 → 3029.90] Because he trusts in God's promises of mercy.
[3029.90 → 3034.90] He doesn't look to himself to work his way out of the depths.
[3034.90 → 3036.90] He looks to God.
[3036.90 → 3040.90] And we see this in several places in this psalm.
[3040.90 → 3047.90] So first, there's this amazing turn from verse 3 to 4.
[3047.90 → 3049.90] Okay, so first, verse 3 says,
[3049.90 → 3054.90] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[3054.90 → 3059.90] But with you there is forgiveness.
[3059.90 → 3070.90] I learned as I was kind of reading about this passage that the Puritan theologian and Pastor John Owen wrote a treatise on this one verse.
[3070.90 → 3072.90] 250 pages.
[3072.90 → 3076.90] Because this is the gospel in the Old Testament.
[3076.90 → 3079.90] If you kept a record of sin, Lord, who could stand?
[3079.90 → 3081.90] But with you there is forgiveness.
[3081.90 → 3085.90] This is one of the key verses that converted John Wesley to the faith.
[3085.90 → 3088.90] Martin Luther wrote a hymn about this.
[3088.90 → 3091.90] And he saw the gospel here in the Old Testament.
[3091.90 → 3093.90] It's an amazing thing.
[3093.90 → 3095.90] But with you there is forgiveness.
[3095.90 → 3098.90] And friends, that is the good news of God's grace for us this morning.
[3098.90 → 3103.90] We say, I am a sinner, but with God there is forgiveness.
[3103.90 → 3104.90] Right?
[3104.90 → 3108.90] I deserve condemnation, but God is a God of mercy.
[3109.90 → 3111.90] So then we see that in verse 4.
[3111.90 → 3113.90] Then in verse 7, it says,
[3113.90 → 3118.90] Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love.
[3118.90 → 3119.90] Right?
[3119.90 → 3125.90] And that word unfailing love is that beautiful, wonderful Hebrew word heed.
[3125.90 → 3133.90] Which means God's everlasting, never giving up, always, forever, never stopping love.
[3133.90 → 3136.90] That is the love that God has for us.
[3136.90 → 3140.90] And this God is this God of covenant love.
[3140.90 → 3144.90] And he sees, and he knows our sin.
[3144.90 → 3145.90] Right?
[3145.90 → 3147.90] We are exposed before him.
[3147.90 → 3152.90] Adam and Eve in the garden, when they were confronted with their sin, what do they do?
[3152.90 → 3155.90] He dove head first into the bush.
[3155.90 → 3156.90] And they hid.
[3156.90 → 3158.90] Because we don't want to be exposed.
[3158.90 → 3162.90] But God sees us fully.
[3162.90 → 3167.90] And yet, he loves us completely.
[3167.90 → 3170.90] And he does not hold our sin against us.
[3170.90 → 3173.90] He keeps no record of wrongs.
[3173.90 → 3176.90] His final word over us is love.
[3176.90 → 3179.90] And friends, how do we know that is true?
[3179.90 → 3183.90] How do we know that God loves us like that?
[3183.90 → 3185.90] It's because of Jesus.
[3185.90 → 3187.90] So look at verse 8.
[3187.90 → 3191.90] Jesus is right here in the psalm.
[3191.90 → 3197.90] It says, he himself, God himself, will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[3197.90 → 3198.90] Right?
[3198.90 → 3202.90] God himself will redeem us through his unfailing love.
[3202.90 → 3204.90] God himself does it.
[3204.90 → 3206.90] He sees us down in the pit.
[3206.90 → 3207.90] And what does he do?
[3207.90 → 3214.90] He doesn't deliver us a message with good advice on how we can live.
[3214.90 → 3221.90] He doesn't even let down a rope and tell us to climb on up.
[3221.90 → 3223.90] He, what does he do?
[3223.90 → 3224.90] He comes down.
[3224.90 → 3225.90] Right?
[3225.90 → 3228.90] He sends his son Jesus into the world.
[3228.90 → 3231.90] He enters into the depths and into the darkness.
[3231.90 → 3233.90] He identifies with his people.
[3233.90 → 3237.90] He enters into the deepest sorrows of judgment for us.
[3237.90 → 3252.90] And then he bears our guilt on the cross himself and rising from the dead, he triumphs over sin, guaranteeing that there's nothing in all creation that will separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ.
[3252.90 → 3258.90] So, it reminded me of this well-known quote from Corrie Ten Boom.
[3258.90 → 3259.90] She was a follower of Jesus.
[3259.90 → 3265.90] She and her family in World War II helped save so many lives of Jewish people.
[3265.90 → 3266.90] And this is what she said.
[3266.90 → 3271.90] That there is no pit so deep that God's love is not deeper still.
[3271.90 → 3272.90] Right?
[3272.90 → 3278.90] There is no pit so deep that God's love is not deeper still.
[3278.90 → 3282.90] So, that's how we deal with our guilt.
[3282.90 → 3283.90] Right?
[3283.90 → 3285.90] You don't pretend it's not real.
[3285.90 → 3286.90] You don't suppress it.
[3286.90 → 3293.90] You don't try to work your way out of it by your own records of righteousness.
[3293.90 → 3295.90] You never will.
[3295.90 → 3304.90] You look to Christ alone who has taken our guilt upon himself and has given us instead his favour and glory freely.
[3304.90 → 3308.90] That is the bright hope of God's mercy.
[3308.90 → 3309.90] Right?
[3309.90 → 3312.90] That is the dawn that we are looking forward to.
[3312.90 → 3316.90] This dawn of forgiveness and redemption that is ours in Christ.
[3316.90 → 3320.90] God redeems the waiting of the night with the bright hope of the morning.
[3320.90 → 3325.90] So, now finally, this morning, I want to leave you with this final image of hope.
[3325.90 → 3328.90] And it's the image of the songbird.
[3328.90 → 3329.90] Okay?
[3329.90 → 3330.90] The image of the songbird.
[3330.90 → 3334.90] So, this is, you know, as I mentioned, this summer, beautiful weather.
[3334.90 → 3348.90] And in the summer, my, Christy and I, we like to, at night, just open up all the windows in the house, open up the windows in our bedroom, and you can just feel the breeze kind of blow in, and it's just wonderful.
[3348.90 → 3351.90] But there's a problem.
[3351.90 → 3356.90] Because at 4am, no sunlight yet.
[3356.90 → 3362.90] But with the windows open, I kept getting woken up by birds singing.
[3362.90 → 3367.90] It's not, and they've already begun to sing, and it's not even light out.
[3367.90 → 3379.90] Even though it's super annoying to be woken up, and it feels like the middle of the night, it's a beautiful picture of anticipation of the dawn.
[3379.90 → 3380.90] Right?
[3380.90 → 3382.90] Now, I don't know a lot about songbirds.
[3382.90 → 3385.90] Maybe some of you do, and if you do, I'd love to learn from you.
[3385.90 → 3391.90] But I did a little bit of research, and in BC, we have many different kinds of songbirds.
[3391.90 → 3398.90] We have song sparrows, robins, cardinals, warblers, starlings, and many more.
[3398.90 → 3401.90] Actually, this week, there was a it's not a songbird.
[3401.90 → 3404.90] It was a what do you call those things?
[3404.90 → 3405.90] Seagull.
[3405.90 → 3408.90] Sitting on the roof of the house.
[3408.90 → 3410.90] Just sitting there, squawk.
[3410.90 → 3412.90] But anyway, so that's now.
[3412.90 → 3413.90] The songbirds are gone.
[3413.90 → 3415.90] I actually don't know where they are.
[3415.90 → 3418.90] By there in the summer, beautiful singing of the songbirds.
[3418.90 → 3424.90] And one of the beautiful things about the songbird is they don't have a larynx like we do, or a voice box.
[3424.90 → 3426.90] They have a spring.
[3426.90 → 3432.90] A spring is closer to their chest, is deeper down, and it's the organ that allows birds to sing.
[3432.90 → 3433.90] It's very small.
[3433.90 → 3438.90] And it's actually amazing because the songbird can breathe in and out, do the circular breathing,
[3438.90 → 3446.90] and at the same time, the air circulates through this voice box, and they can actually harmonize with themselves.
[3446.90 → 3448.90] It's incredible.
[3448.90 → 3456.90] And one of the things, though, that was so surprising to me was that people don't know why birds sing in the morning.
[3456.90 → 3460.90] I couldn't find it, my very brief research.
[3460.90 → 3466.90] It mentioned that, okay, well, birds sing because they warn of danger.
[3466.90 → 3471.90] They sing, there's a mating song, right, so they want to attract a mate.
[3471.90 → 3474.90] But people don't know why they sing in the morning.
[3474.90 → 3486.90] And what I would like to think, and even if, you know, of course, scientists, they might find a scientific reason why they sing in the morning, and that's great.
[3486.90 → 3496.90] At the same time, though, I like to think that God who created the sunrise designed the singing of the birds in the morning.
[3496.90 → 3504.90] That God in his creativity not only created this beautiful dawn that we see visually, but he set it to music.
[3504.90 → 3507.90] Right? That's amazing. God is like that.
[3507.90 → 3513.90] And you begin to hear the dawn even before you see the sun coming up.
[3513.90 → 3516.90] You can hear the anticipation of the dawn.
[3516.90 → 3521.90] And so I'd like to leave you with that same hope, the hope of the songbird.
[3521.90 → 3533.90] Right? Just like the bird makes no contribution to the sun rising, there's absolutely nothing we do to contribute to the mercy that God has for us in Christ.
[3533.90 → 3538.90] But like the songbird, our response to the dawn is that we can sing.
[3538.90 → 3546.90] Right? The songbird can sing in the dark because it knows the reliability of the sun coming up.
[3546.90 → 3550.90] If it didn't know, it wouldn't sing, but it knows that the sun is going to come.
[3550.90 → 3562.90] And in the same way, we sing in the hope of the dawn of the new creation based on the reliability and the truthfulness of God's word and his promises.
[3562.90 → 3563.90] Right?
[3563.90 → 3579.90] Our song is a song first of repentance and confession and honesty before God, but also it's a song of hope that no matter what sin we experience during the week and during that day,
[3579.90 → 3584.90] there is grace and there is forgiveness and there is redemption in Christ.
[3584.90 → 3588.90] Okay? We have a great hope in the brightness of the dawn.
[3588.90 → 3589.90] And so we sing.
[3589.90 → 3591.90] Okay? Be a songbird.
[3591.90 → 3592.90] That's the point.
[3592.90 → 3596.90] Okay? Let's pray together.
[3596.90 → 3610.90] Father, we thank you for the great promises that even though, Lord, we are weary and laboured, we are sinful and frail and weak,
[3610.90 → 3627.54] truly, ЕТ MAL
[3627.54 → 3634.90] forgiveness and has given us his righteousness that we couldn't get on our own. And because of
[3634.90 → 3643.00] that, Lord, we sing. We sing for the dawn in the hope that we have. And Lord, just like in this
[3643.00 → 3649.80] last verse, the psalmist calls all of Israel to sing. And because of the hope that we have, Lord,
[3649.80 → 3657.02] would you allow us in our everyday lives to call people around us also to know the hope that you
[3657.02 → 3667.84] have for us. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. So I invite you to stand and we will sing together Amazing Grace.
[3687.02 → 3703.02] Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound.
[3703.02 → 3722.02] Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me.
[3722.02 → 3736.02] I once was lost, but now I'm found. But I'm blind, but now I see.
[3736.02 → 3751.02] T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[3751.02 → 3766.02] How precious did that grace appear, and God my curse believed.
[3766.02 → 3785.02] My chains are gone, I've been set free. My God my Saviour has ransomed me. And like a flood,
[3785.02 → 3811.02] His mercy raised. Unending love, amazing grace. The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope scours.
[3811.02 → 3829.02] He will my shield and portion be, as long as life endures.
[3829.02 → 3844.02] Through many dangers, trials and snares, I am already found.
[3844.02 → 3846.02] And like a flood, I am already found.
[3846.02 → 3851.02] My God my Saviour has ransomed me. And like a flood, I've been set free.
[3851.02 → 3853.02] My God my Saviour has ransomed me. The Lord has ransomed me.
[3853.02 → 3857.02] And like a flood, I've been set free. My God my Saviour has ransomed me.
[3857.02 → 3870.02] And like a flood, I've been set free. My God my Saviour has ransomed me. And like a flood, His mercy reigns.
[3870.02 → 3871.02] Unending love, amazing grace.
[3871.02 → 3877.02] Unending love, amazing grace.
[3877.02 → 3878.02] My God my Saviour has ransomed me.
[3878.02 → 3879.02] I've been set free. My God my Saviour has ransomed me.
[3879.02 → 3880.02] My God my Saviour has ransomed me.
[3880.02 → 3884.02] And like a flood, His mercy reigns.
[3884.02 → 3885.02] Unending love, amazing grace.
[3885.02 → 3893.02] Unending love, amazing grace.
[3893.02 → 3901.26] We've lived ten thousand years,
[3901.26 → 3909.26] I've died in the house of the sun.
[3909.26 → 3917.98] We've no best days to say God's praise,
[3917.98 → 3924.98] When chore his ludicrous will borrow.
[3943.84 → 3947.22] Please join me in prayer.
[3947.98 → 3958.98] O Lord God, creator above us, spirit within us, Lord ahead of us, open us to yourself
[3958.98 → 3962.22] that we may become transparent to ourselves.
[3963.32 → 3967.10] Make us masters of ourselves that we may be the servants of others.
[3968.02 → 3971.96] In the name of Jesus Christ, we bless you for the gift of our lives.
[3971.96 → 3978.88] We bless you for the invisible fibres of loyalty and trust that bind us to the people we love and care for,
[3979.48 → 3983.70] for fidelity in our marriages, for care and love for our children,
[3984.40 → 3987.54] for the gifts you've allowed us to discover within ourselves,
[3987.98 → 3991.76] and for the gifts other people have given us by giving of themselves.
[3993.66 → 3999.62] We bless you for useful jobs to do, for leisure to enjoy, for fun to have,
[3999.62 → 4002.96] for homes to live in, for love to share.
[4004.34 → 4007.70] We pray to you for our friends and the people we care about,
[4008.50 → 4012.34] for people whose life has somehow become boring and lusterless,
[4012.82 → 4016.24] whose marriages have lost their tenderness, whose health is poor,
[4017.10 → 4020.54] whose hope for the years ahead is dim, and whose death is near.
[4022.96 → 4026.62] Lord, we pray to you today for the work of night shift ministry.
[4026.62 → 4029.22] May it be an instrument of change,
[4029.36 → 4033.34] as it reflects your love in tangible ways to the communities it serves.
[4034.34 → 4036.48] We pray also for Lee Vendor.
[4037.30 → 4040.02] As she waits surgery, please give her strength
[4040.02 → 4043.62] and be with Scott, Haley, and Sarah
[4043.62 → 4046.72] as they walk alongside her in this difficult time.
[4047.80 → 4048.84] We pray for Honda.
[4048.84 → 4053.42] Please grant her healing and relief as she struggles with the effects
[4053.42 → 4056.20] of her weight loss and inability to eat.
[4058.96 → 4062.16] Lord, we pray in the week to come for the elections,
[4062.44 → 4066.68] and just pray for your will to be reflected through that,
[4066.82 → 4070.76] and for it to be done in a safe and meaningful manner.
[4070.76 → 4074.80] And we also pray just for civility in our society,
[4074.86 → 4077.80] as we all have different views of restrictions
[4077.80 → 4080.60] and other measures against the pandemic.
[4080.74 → 4083.44] And we just, again, just pray for your grace to be among us,
[4083.48 → 4086.00] that we can have meaningful dialogue, of course,
[4086.24 → 4089.20] but also do it in a respectful and loving way.
[4090.90 → 4093.74] And we pray for peace, Lord, through the world.
[4094.30 → 4096.16] Let all who think lightly of making war
[4096.16 → 4099.54] be converted to think strongly of making peace.
[4100.34 → 4103.00] We pray for people for whom today is another day
[4103.00 → 4104.66] of trying to find something to eat,
