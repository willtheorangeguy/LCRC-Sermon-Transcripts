[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 209.98]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 239.98]  Thank you.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Thank you.
[270.00 --> 276.56]  Please make one New Year's resolution to email, text, or phone another church member
[276.56 --> 280.12]  today with wishes for a blessed New Year.
[280.12 --> 310.10]  Join me in this call to worship.
[310.10 --> 311.10]  Amen.
[311.10 --> 312.10]  Amen.
[312.10 --> 326.44]  Let's praise our Father God with song.
[340.10 --> 370.10]  We praise you, O God, our Redeemer,
[370.10 --> 372.10]  and we bless you.
[372.10 --> 376.10]  We bless you, O God of our fathers and mothers.
[376.10 --> 400.10]  We bless you, O God of our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, you have been.
[400.10 --> 401.10]  When And that's it.
[401.10 --> 402.10]  When we bless you, O God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, our God, you have been.
[402.10 --> 408.26]  Arrows overtake us, you never forsake us.
[408.26 --> 417.20]  And with your help, O Lord, our battles we win.
[418.96 --> 426.60]  With voices united, our praises we offer.
[426.60 --> 434.52]  Our songs of thanksgiving to you we now raise.
[435.04 --> 442.94]  Your strong arm will guide us, our God is beside us.
[443.24 --> 451.12]  To you, our great Redeemer, for every praise.
[456.60 --> 456.90]  The
[456.90 --> 458.90]  Amen.
[486.90 --> 488.90]  Amen.
[516.90 --> 518.90]  Amen.
[546.90 --> 556.68]  Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus Christ is still the same.
[556.68 --> 558.68]  Amen.
[586.68 --> 605.68]  Each new generation hears you, each must find a fresh new way to make known the life you offer to the people in their day.
[605.68 --> 616.68]  On this day we pause and wonder what the future years will bring.
[616.68 --> 625.68]  Let me know you clothe each flower and you make each sparrow sing.
[625.68 --> 634.68]  How much more will you protect us with your guiding care in hand?
[634.68 --> 646.68]  By your spirit lead us boldly in the future you have planned.
[646.68 --> 664.68]  At this time our clerk of council, John, will give us the annual report from the council.
[664.68 --> 682.68]  Good morning. This is the Year in Review 2020 Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[682.68 --> 688.68]  Once again, we as a congregation can testify to God's faithfulness.
[688.68 --> 694.68]  Ladner Christian Reformed Church started off in 2020 with all its usual ministries.
[694.68 --> 712.68]  Single parents, Friendship Coffee House, Cadets, Gems, Coffee Break, Small Groups, Ladies Bible Study, Senior Ministry, Men's Breakfast, and the Spring Cross Training Session.
[712.68 --> 722.68]  In March, COVID-19 changed how we did our ministries. Some have not yet started back and some are meeting via Zoom.
[722.68 --> 726.68]  Last year, this report concluded with the words,
[726.68 --> 736.68]  We praise God for His presence and grace and look forward to what He has in store for our church and our community in 2020.
[736.68 --> 746.68]  Even with the very unexpected arrival of the pandemic, we can still attest to God's presence and grace.
[746.68 --> 752.68]  We would never have thought at the beginning of last year what we would be dealing with.
[752.68 --> 762.68]  We are thankful that even though we are not meeting together physically, we are still a church body with community and connection.
[762.68 --> 771.68]  Some committees of our church had to cease operating because of the pandemic, namely the new moms and nursery maintenance and scheduling.
[771.68 --> 777.68]  And sadly, we were not able to host our basic skills camp last summer.
[777.68 --> 781.68]  In the background, many groups and committees are functioning faithfully.
[781.68 --> 790.68]  Worship committee, hospitality, maintenance committee, accounting committee, and new immigrant support team.
[790.68 --> 793.68]  Thanks to all those volunteering.
[793.68 --> 801.68]  A special thank you to Mel Rass, our treasurer, for keeping our finances and records in such good order.
[801.68 --> 805.68]  Also extra thanks to our audio-visual team.
[805.68 --> 810.68]  Without them, we would not have been able to carry on with worship via live stream.
[810.68 --> 816.68]  Thanks also to our elders and deacons for serving our church this past year.
[816.68 --> 823.68]  Even with some difficult decisions complying with provincial health guidelines.
[823.68 --> 826.68]  Some of the highlights of this year's ministry are,
[826.68 --> 831.68]  Pastor Jason started his ministry with us one year ago today.
[831.68 --> 835.68]  We have been truly blessed by his coming to Ladner.
[835.68 --> 843.68]  Besides Pastor Jason's pastoral work and preaching, he has also started baptism classes,
[843.68 --> 852.68]  conducted mid-week Bible studies via Zoom, led a young men's Bible study, and led a cross-training session on Zoom.
[852.68 --> 859.68]  Pastor Jason has also updated our website and regularly posts a blog on the website.
[859.68 --> 863.68]  We are delighted to have his family join us.
[863.68 --> 869.68]  Nancy Yang was hired as a half-time associate pastor of Chinese ministry.
[869.68 --> 879.68]  She started her ministry in September and was able to meet five Sundays before COVID restrictions prevented meeting together.
[879.68 --> 886.68]  During this start, 15 to 17 persons were attending the Sunday worship service.
[886.68 --> 889.68]  They are now meeting via live stream.
[889.68 --> 892.68]  We also started a parenting course.
[892.68 --> 897.68]  She also started a parenting course and is still doing a Wednesday morning Bible study via Zoom,
[897.68 --> 900.68]  with about 16 people joining in.
[900.68 --> 904.68]  We can see how God has blessed the start of this ministry.
[904.68 --> 911.68]  Hannah Yao was hired as our part-time children's ministry director starting in September.
[911.68 --> 920.68]  During the weeks she was able to have in-person Kids Life, there were about 15 children attending each Sunday.
[920.68 --> 925.68]  Now Nancy is doing Zoom Kids Life classes via Zoom.
[925.68 --> 928.68]  Again, God is blessing Hannah's work.
[928.68 --> 933.68]  The Connections newsletter was developed by Bev and Pastor Jason.
[933.68 --> 940.68]  It comes out twice per month and has helped our community stay informed in the absence of the weekly church bulletin.
[940.68 --> 947.68]  We appreciate Pastor Jason's articles and the interesting interviews.
[947.68 --> 953.68]  Issue number 18 will be published in mid-January.
[953.68 --> 958.68]  In September, Wind and Tide started their preschool in our church.
[958.68 --> 961.68]  Working with Wind and Tide has gone very smoothly.
[961.68 --> 966.68]  Council is thankful for the faithful giving of our congregation.
[966.68 --> 973.68]  Even though we have not been gathering for worship most of the year, we are still meeting our budget.
[973.68 --> 977.68]  Plus, we are contributing a lot to special causes.
[977.68 --> 983.68]  We welcome the following persons who became members of our church in 2020.
[983.68 --> 1006.68]  Pastor Jason, Christy, Ellie, Abram, John and Gabby, Serena Smith, Steven Zhao and Nancy Yang, Joel Smith, and Edgar Wong, Suzanne Su and their children, Serena and Sylvia, who are in the process of transferring their membership to our church.
[1006.68 --> 1026.68]  We also welcome two new immigrant families, Kukuya Arga, Kiya Girma, and their girls, Ulyana and Barkut, originally from Ethiopia, and also Vahid, Kashrafter, Benaz, Bazzadian, and their son Radman, originally from Firan.
[1026.68 --> 1033.68]  The arrival of both families was delayed by several months due to international travel restrictions.
[1033.68 --> 1042.68]  A special thank you to all those on our team who set up two apartments very quickly, and for those who give ongoing support to these folks.
[1042.68 --> 1046.68]  What a blessing to have these friends come to Delta.
[1046.68 --> 1052.68]  Our church will be supporting these two families for most of 2021.
[1052.68 --> 1058.68]  Our congregation was saddened by the death of four of our members during 2020.
[1058.68 --> 1068.68]  Lena Walton, Bill VanDopp, Tim VanTall, and Kathy Slott just last week.
[1068.68 --> 1076.68]  We take comfort with the psalmist, knowing that the Lord heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[1076.68 --> 1082.68]  We look forward to the return of Christ, when God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[1082.68 --> 1086.68]  There shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
[1086.68 --> 1091.68]  There will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.
[1091.68 --> 1094.68]  That's in Revelation 21 verse 4.
[1094.68 --> 1098.68]  Some of our long-time members and friends have moved away.
[1098.68 --> 1101.68]  George and Ada Winklehorst to Abbotsford.
[1101.68 --> 1104.68]  Ernst and Winnie DeRees to Alberta.
[1104.68 --> 1109.68]  Gert Bannermuelen to Elam in Surrey.
[1109.68 --> 1111.68]  The Berries to Belize.
[1111.68 --> 1116.68]  And Justin and Julian, whom we had sponsored, moved to Saskatoon.
[1116.68 --> 1123.68]  Again, we do not know what God has in store for us in 2021.
[1123.68 --> 1130.68]  We pray that during the coming year, we will be able to resume our in-person worship and ministries.
[1130.68 --> 1138.68]  We ask God for his continued blessing and care as we grow in grace together and reach out to our community,
[1138.68 --> 1141.68]  especially during this time of the pandemic.
[1141.68 --> 1143.68]  Thank you.
[1143.68 --> 1171.68]  Thank you.
[1171.68 --> 1179.68]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[1179.68 --> 1187.68]  There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1187.68 --> 1194.68]  Thou changest not, but compassions they fail not.
[1194.68 --> 1202.68]  As thou hast been, thou forever will be.
[1202.68 --> 1211.68]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1211.68 --> 1213.68]  Lord unto me.
[1213.68 --> 1219.68]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1219.68 --> 1227.68]  All I have needed, thy hand has provided.
[1227.68 --> 1235.68]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[1235.68 --> 1236.68]  My God may be.
[1236.68 --> 1245.68]  Any Seeking knowing the men of birth mighty.
[1245.68 --> 1249.68]  I am sleep when there be no right.
[1249.68 --> 1255.18]  Stars in their forces above,
[1255.78 --> 1263.52]  Joined with the nature in manifold witness,
[1263.52 --> 1272.10]  To thy faithfulness, mercy, and love.
[1272.10 --> 1280.64]  Great is thy faithfulness, Great is thy faithfulness,
[1280.64 --> 1288.28]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1288.88 --> 1297.04]  All I have needed, thy hand has grown by head.
[1297.04 --> 1305.44]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[1308.90 --> 1316.40]  Pardon for sin and a peace that endures,
[1316.40 --> 1324.18]  Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[1324.18 --> 1331.26]  Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[1332.64 --> 1338.82]  Blessings, O mine, with ten thousand beside.
[1341.32 --> 1349.24]  Great is thy faithfulness, Great is thy faithfulness,
[1349.24 --> 1357.26]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1357.94 --> 1365.80]  All I have needed, thy hand has grown by head.
[1365.80 --> 1375.88]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[1375.88 --> 1388.12]  Well, happy new year, brothers and sisters.
[1389.72 --> 1391.98]  Again, I do wish that we could be together,
[1392.64 --> 1398.14]  but I also wish you, from afar through the interwebs,
[1398.74 --> 1404.02]  a happy new year, and the hope and the blessing
[1404.02 --> 1406.26]  that this year would be full of joy.
[1406.38 --> 1409.02]  It would be full of joy in the Lord and what God is doing.
[1410.32 --> 1413.34]  And so today, we're actually going to be concluding
[1413.34 --> 1416.82]  the series that we started back at the beginning of Advent.
[1417.86 --> 1420.02]  It's a series that's called King of Our Longing,
[1420.08 --> 1422.24]  looking at the first few chapters in the book of Luke.
[1423.06 --> 1425.36]  And today, we're reading a passage that I think
[1425.36 --> 1427.24]  is very appropriate for New Year's,
[1427.28 --> 1431.44]  a time when we often, maybe the only time of the year,
[1431.44 --> 1436.14]  when we really consider our lives, and is there a vitality,
[1436.34 --> 1439.64]  and is God at work, and where are we going in life?
[1440.32 --> 1442.28]  And so let's give our attention to God's word.
[1442.40 --> 1444.70]  We'll be reading Luke chapter 3,
[1445.20 --> 1449.40]  and we'll read the passage, verses 7 through 18, actually.
[1449.40 --> 1454.66]  John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him,
[1455.28 --> 1459.12]  You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath.
[1460.66 --> 1462.96]  Produce fruit in keeping with repentance,
[1463.48 --> 1465.92]  and do not begin to say to yourselves,
[1466.50 --> 1468.06]  We have Abraham as our father.
[1469.00 --> 1471.34]  For I tell you that out of these stones,
[1471.46 --> 1473.76]  God can raise up children for Abraham.
[1473.76 --> 1477.94]  The axe is already at the root of the trees,
[1478.56 --> 1481.42]  and every tree that does not produce good fruit
[1481.42 --> 1484.16]  will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
[1485.02 --> 1486.38]  What should we do then?
[1486.74 --> 1487.56]  The crowd asked.
[1488.82 --> 1489.50]  John answered,
[1490.16 --> 1493.70]  Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none,
[1494.32 --> 1497.14]  and anyone who has food should do the same.
[1498.20 --> 1500.54]  Even tax collectors came to be baptized.
[1500.94 --> 1502.10]  Teacher, they asked,
[1502.10 --> 1503.34]  What should we do?
[1503.98 --> 1507.52]  Don't collect any more than you are required to, he told them.
[1508.86 --> 1511.12]  Then some soldiers asked him,
[1511.58 --> 1512.66]  And what should we do?
[1513.52 --> 1514.26]  He replied,
[1514.82 --> 1515.80]  Don't extort money,
[1516.30 --> 1518.10]  and don't accuse people falsely.
[1518.62 --> 1519.92]  Be content with your pay.
[1520.86 --> 1522.80]  The people were waiting expectantly,
[1522.92 --> 1524.82]  and were all wondering in their hearts
[1524.82 --> 1528.64]  if John might possibly be the Messiah.
[1529.04 --> 1530.10]  John answered them all,
[1530.10 --> 1531.98]  I baptize you with water,
[1531.98 --> 1535.16]  but one who is more powerful than I will come,
[1535.70 --> 1538.38]  the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
[1538.92 --> 1542.40]  He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
[1543.40 --> 1545.70]  His winnowing fork is in his hand
[1545.70 --> 1547.34]  to clear his threshing floor
[1547.34 --> 1549.80]  and to gather the wheat into his barn,
[1550.24 --> 1553.18]  but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
[1553.18 --> 1555.72]  And with many other words,
[1556.06 --> 1557.38]  John exhorted the people
[1557.38 --> 1560.94]  and proclaimed the good news to them.
[1562.40 --> 1564.18]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1565.18 --> 1566.26]  Thanks be to God.
[1566.72 --> 1568.60]  And friends, it is absolutely true,
[1569.12 --> 1570.64]  and God has given it to us
[1570.64 --> 1571.86]  because he loves us.
[1572.24 --> 1573.80]  So let's come before him together
[1573.80 --> 1576.92]  in this prayer of illumination as we begin.
[1576.92 --> 1579.18]  Father, by your Spirit,
[1579.98 --> 1583.56]  just as you have spoken through the prophet John the Baptist
[1583.56 --> 1585.58]  so long ago,
[1585.84 --> 1588.38]  and Lord, you continue to speak to us now
[1588.38 --> 1589.14]  through your word
[1589.14 --> 1591.30]  because your Holy Spirit is active.
[1592.30 --> 1595.18]  Lord, we ask that your Spirit would be active in our lives.
[1596.00 --> 1598.48]  Lord, would your Spirit be active in our church?
[1599.28 --> 1602.20]  And Lord, would you help us to see Christ clearly?
[1602.70 --> 1603.70]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1604.00 --> 1604.24]  Amen.
[1604.24 --> 1604.34]  Amen.
[1604.34 --> 1604.54]  Amen.
[1606.60 --> 1610.46]  So after my family and I left the mission field from Taiwan
[1610.46 --> 1612.56]  and before coming out here to Vancouver,
[1612.94 --> 1615.42]  we were given a place to stay
[1615.42 --> 1617.26]  by some people in our church,
[1617.86 --> 1621.40]  and it was an old country house in Virginia,
[1621.56 --> 1623.22]  and it had this large acreage.
[1623.76 --> 1624.84]  And it was a beautiful place,
[1624.88 --> 1626.34]  and it was really great for us
[1626.34 --> 1629.34]  because the kids were able to run in the woods
[1629.34 --> 1629.94]  and the fields
[1629.94 --> 1632.04]  and had lots of room to tramp around.
[1632.04 --> 1635.92]  And the best part about the property
[1635.92 --> 1639.32]  was there was a stream that ran all through it.
[1639.66 --> 1642.76]  And so we spent so much time playing in the stream.
[1642.88 --> 1644.38]  I mean, it wasn't deep enough to swim in,
[1644.46 --> 1645.64]  but we would wade in it.
[1645.90 --> 1648.82]  We would make little boats out of bark and things
[1648.82 --> 1650.62]  and race them down the stream.
[1650.98 --> 1654.70]  We would hunt for crawfish and minnows.
[1654.70 --> 1658.32]  And there was actually also a place
[1658.32 --> 1661.44]  where the hill, the property went up
[1661.44 --> 1663.20]  and the stream would flow down it,
[1663.56 --> 1665.74]  and there was even kind of the water would tumble
[1665.74 --> 1667.50]  over some rocks and there was a little waterfall.
[1668.00 --> 1669.44]  So it was a really fun place.
[1670.46 --> 1672.72]  And while we were there, it became winter,
[1673.30 --> 1676.40]  and the temperature was cold enough or long enough
[1676.40 --> 1678.26]  that the stream actually froze over.
[1678.26 --> 1681.66]  And even the waterfall froze.
[1682.52 --> 1684.24]  And I don't know if you've ever seen that before,
[1684.38 --> 1686.34]  if you've ever seen a frozen waterfall.
[1686.98 --> 1688.86]  But what's fascinating about water
[1688.86 --> 1690.38]  when it freezes like that
[1690.38 --> 1694.92]  is that it has all of the appearances of life,
[1695.14 --> 1696.50]  doesn't it, if you've seen it?
[1696.96 --> 1701.36]  It has all these kind of forms and shapes of moving water.
[1701.88 --> 1705.88]  And it kind of looks like there's vitality and energy there.
[1705.88 --> 1711.12]  But the reality is the waterfall is frozen, right?
[1711.20 --> 1713.94]  It's static, it's unmoving, it's lifeless.
[1715.16 --> 1716.78]  Well, during this season of Advent,
[1717.02 --> 1720.86]  we've been looking at Advent as a time of longing.
[1721.68 --> 1724.36]  You know, in the passages in Luke we've looked at,
[1724.42 --> 1727.32]  we've talked about our longing for things like joy,
[1728.18 --> 1731.06]  for grace, for mercy, for peace,
[1731.58 --> 1732.96]  for comfort, and for salvation.
[1732.96 --> 1736.30]  And the last thing we're going to talk about today,
[1736.98 --> 1738.44]  and it's something that's very fitting
[1738.44 --> 1741.14]  for this New Year's Day,
[1741.78 --> 1745.02]  is our longing for life.
[1745.56 --> 1747.88]  Our longing for fruitfulness in life,
[1747.96 --> 1750.76]  for true life that is vital and dynamic,
[1750.98 --> 1753.40]  and that is like a flowing stream.
[1754.70 --> 1756.52]  And our passage for today
[1756.52 --> 1758.56]  is seeking to get underneath
[1758.56 --> 1761.08]  the appearance of life.
[1761.08 --> 1762.00]  Right?
[1762.06 --> 1763.50]  It's seeking to get underneath
[1763.50 --> 1766.26]  the mere look of vitality,
[1766.60 --> 1768.28]  the shape and form of life,
[1768.70 --> 1770.44]  the mere activity of our lives,
[1770.66 --> 1772.86]  to try to break through the frozenness
[1772.86 --> 1774.20]  and stir us up
[1774.20 --> 1777.10]  to offer us true life,
[1777.50 --> 1779.80]  to offer us the source of life.
[1780.78 --> 1781.20]  And friends,
[1781.28 --> 1782.72]  what our passage tells us today
[1782.72 --> 1785.66]  is that our longing for life,
[1785.70 --> 1786.24]  and as Christians,
[1786.24 --> 1789.14]  we long for spiritual life,
[1789.20 --> 1790.36]  where we're not kind of frozen
[1790.36 --> 1791.94]  and stuck in our life with God,
[1792.06 --> 1794.14]  but that we're producing good fruit,
[1794.20 --> 1795.50]  as this passage calls us to.
[1796.04 --> 1797.98]  But just like all of the longings
[1797.98 --> 1798.92]  that we have,
[1799.24 --> 1800.58]  what we see from this passage
[1800.58 --> 1803.16]  is that our longing for life
[1803.16 --> 1805.36]  ultimately, again,
[1805.46 --> 1806.90]  is fulfilled in the person
[1806.90 --> 1807.80]  of Jesus Christ.
[1808.60 --> 1810.22]  So I'd like us to look at our passage
[1810.22 --> 1810.76]  this morning
[1810.76 --> 1812.64]  and see what it has to say to us.
[1812.64 --> 1813.90]  And I just want to look simply
[1813.90 --> 1815.34]  at two points for today.
[1816.34 --> 1816.90]  And first,
[1817.38 --> 1818.44]  our need for life.
[1819.50 --> 1819.90]  Secondly,
[1820.52 --> 1822.08]  where we can get it.
[1822.22 --> 1823.36]  Where does this life come from?
[1824.12 --> 1824.32]  All right,
[1824.40 --> 1825.90]  so our passage for today,
[1826.04 --> 1826.56]  just first,
[1826.68 --> 1827.40]  we're going to look at
[1827.40 --> 1829.38]  the need that we all have
[1829.38 --> 1830.74]  for life.
[1832.22 --> 1832.42]  You know,
[1832.46 --> 1833.24]  this passage,
[1833.58 --> 1834.70]  it's about the ministry
[1834.70 --> 1835.64]  of John the Baptist.
[1835.76 --> 1836.46]  And we looked at him
[1836.46 --> 1837.56]  a little bit last week,
[1837.88 --> 1838.48]  last Sunday.
[1839.40 --> 1840.68]  And now if you look with me
[1840.68 --> 1841.60]  at verse 7,
[1841.60 --> 1842.68]  it tells us
[1842.68 --> 1843.98]  that John is out
[1843.98 --> 1844.58]  in the wilderness
[1844.58 --> 1846.32]  and he's calling everyone,
[1846.44 --> 1847.04]  men and women,
[1847.72 --> 1848.58]  to a baptism
[1848.58 --> 1849.78]  of repentance.
[1851.16 --> 1851.34]  Okay,
[1851.40 --> 1851.74]  so now,
[1851.96 --> 1853.10]  what is John doing?
[1853.80 --> 1854.46]  For us,
[1854.52 --> 1855.72]  as modern readers,
[1856.00 --> 1856.70]  this doesn't seem
[1856.70 --> 1857.26]  that unusual.
[1858.08 --> 1858.78]  But this call
[1858.78 --> 1859.60]  to be baptized
[1859.60 --> 1861.90]  would have been shocking
[1861.90 --> 1862.94]  to anyone
[1862.94 --> 1864.18]  who heard him.
[1864.82 --> 1865.84]  Because baptism,
[1866.04 --> 1866.14]  you know,
[1866.16 --> 1867.00]  it's Christian baptism,
[1867.34 --> 1867.56]  you know,
[1867.56 --> 1868.30]  we're all used to that.
[1868.36 --> 1869.28]  But at that time,
[1869.28 --> 1870.56]  baptism was very different.
[1871.36 --> 1871.82]  Essentially,
[1872.10 --> 1873.64]  it was a cleansing ritual.
[1874.44 --> 1874.90]  But,
[1875.10 --> 1876.34]  it was a ritual
[1876.34 --> 1878.52]  only for Gentiles.
[1879.12 --> 1880.22]  Only for those
[1880.22 --> 1880.84]  who needed
[1880.84 --> 1882.92]  to be ritually cleaned
[1882.92 --> 1884.50]  so that they could convert
[1884.50 --> 1885.66]  to Judaism
[1885.66 --> 1886.10]  to be,
[1886.28 --> 1887.54]  to worship the true God.
[1888.66 --> 1889.48]  And what that means
[1889.48 --> 1890.62]  is that if you were a Jew,
[1891.04 --> 1891.18]  right,
[1891.20 --> 1891.92]  if you were a member
[1891.92 --> 1892.52]  of the covenant
[1892.52 --> 1894.08]  that God had with Abraham,
[1894.82 --> 1895.56]  you wouldn't need
[1895.56 --> 1895.98]  to be,
[1895.98 --> 1897.08]  to receive baptism
[1897.08 --> 1898.20]  because you were
[1898.20 --> 1900.02]  already ceremonially clean.
[1900.56 --> 1901.92]  But now,
[1902.10 --> 1903.52]  here comes John the Baptist
[1903.52 --> 1905.18]  and he says,
[1905.76 --> 1906.98]  everybody in the water,
[1907.54 --> 1907.70]  right,
[1907.80 --> 1909.40]  everybody needs
[1909.40 --> 1910.26]  to be baptized.
[1911.18 --> 1912.08]  Meaning what?
[1913.06 --> 1913.54]  Meaning,
[1914.22 --> 1915.38]  we're all unclean.
[1916.46 --> 1916.66]  Right?
[1916.92 --> 1918.02]  Even you,
[1918.48 --> 1919.78]  children of Israel,
[1920.32 --> 1921.96]  you need to receive
[1921.96 --> 1923.32]  the same baptism.
[1924.06 --> 1925.22]  You need to repent
[1925.22 --> 1927.28]  and you need to receive
[1927.28 --> 1928.46]  God's forgiveness.
[1930.14 --> 1930.58]  So,
[1930.66 --> 1931.52]  in verse 8,
[1932.22 --> 1933.42]  John anticipates
[1933.42 --> 1934.42]  what they're going to say.
[1934.50 --> 1935.54]  He's probably heard
[1935.54 --> 1936.22]  it all before.
[1936.68 --> 1936.78]  So,
[1936.84 --> 1937.42]  he says,
[1937.90 --> 1938.66]  do not begin
[1938.66 --> 1939.70]  to say to yourselves,
[1940.28 --> 1941.06]  we have Abraham
[1941.06 --> 1941.82]  as our father.
[1943.28 --> 1943.74]  So,
[1943.82 --> 1943.98]  now,
[1944.20 --> 1944.56]  again,
[1944.64 --> 1945.24]  this argument
[1945.24 --> 1946.42]  about lineage,
[1946.58 --> 1946.78]  you know,
[1947.02 --> 1948.16]  we're sons of Abraham,
[1948.58 --> 1949.62]  claiming Abraham
[1949.62 --> 1950.54]  as their father,
[1950.54 --> 1952.38]  that also sounds
[1952.38 --> 1953.26]  a little strange
[1953.26 --> 1954.02]  to our ears.
[1955.08 --> 1955.98]  But they're,
[1956.04 --> 1957.22]  they're not trying
[1957.22 --> 1958.04]  to argue
[1958.04 --> 1959.58]  biological facts.
[1960.06 --> 1960.28]  Right?
[1960.32 --> 1961.24]  They're not making
[1961.24 --> 1961.88]  the argument
[1961.88 --> 1962.34]  and saying,
[1962.50 --> 1962.68]  hey,
[1962.86 --> 1963.12]  we,
[1963.28 --> 1964.44]  we are literally
[1964.44 --> 1965.80]  descendants of Abraham.
[1966.08 --> 1966.38]  Like,
[1966.40 --> 1967.48]  we share a genetic
[1967.48 --> 1968.74]  ancestry with him.
[1969.54 --> 1970.10]  Now,
[1970.14 --> 1970.80]  I don't think anybody
[1970.80 --> 1971.98]  would dispute that,
[1972.24 --> 1973.28]  but that's not their point.
[1973.94 --> 1974.76]  What they're doing
[1974.76 --> 1975.52]  is they're making
[1975.52 --> 1976.48]  a moral
[1976.48 --> 1977.84]  and ethical argument.
[1978.50 --> 1979.50]  They're essentially saying,
[1980.28 --> 1981.90]  we measure up
[1981.90 --> 1983.06]  religiously
[1983.06 --> 1984.24]  to this scale
[1984.24 --> 1985.06]  where we can be
[1985.06 --> 1985.70]  considered
[1985.70 --> 1986.54]  worthy
[1986.54 --> 1987.90]  of Abraham,
[1988.16 --> 1988.86]  our father.
[1989.78 --> 1990.50]  In other words,
[1990.54 --> 1991.10]  in their eyes,
[1991.16 --> 1991.72]  they would say,
[1992.12 --> 1993.14]  we're good Jews.
[1993.62 --> 1994.96]  We're doing enough.
[1995.08 --> 1996.20]  We're obeying the law.
[1996.32 --> 1996.98]  We're living up
[1996.98 --> 1997.72]  to expectations.
[1998.26 --> 1999.20]  We're sons of Abraham.
[2000.80 --> 2002.56]  But John is insisting,
[2003.12 --> 2003.88]  you are not
[2003.88 --> 2004.76]  sons of Abraham.
[2005.38 --> 2006.84]  You cannot have Abraham
[2006.84 --> 2007.72]  as your father
[2007.72 --> 2009.54]  because your behavior
[2009.54 --> 2011.46]  disagrees with your claim.
[2012.38 --> 2013.50]  If you want to have
[2013.50 --> 2015.02]  Abraham as your father,
[2015.14 --> 2015.72]  he says,
[2016.10 --> 2017.26]  produce fruit
[2017.26 --> 2018.14]  in keeping
[2018.14 --> 2019.36]  with repentance.
[2020.22 --> 2021.48]  Your life needs to
[2021.48 --> 2022.46]  show
[2022.46 --> 2023.56]  what you're claiming
[2023.56 --> 2024.12]  to be.
[2025.16 --> 2025.46]  And friends,
[2025.54 --> 2026.66]  the underlying principle
[2026.66 --> 2027.52]  here is this.
[2028.32 --> 2028.92]  John is saying
[2028.92 --> 2029.48]  to the crowds
[2029.48 --> 2029.92]  and he's saying
[2029.92 --> 2030.70]  to us today
[2030.70 --> 2032.76]  that what you believe
[2032.76 --> 2034.46]  is not what you say
[2034.46 --> 2035.14]  you believe.
[2035.78 --> 2036.60]  What you believe
[2036.60 --> 2037.38]  is what you do.
[2037.72 --> 2039.68]  This is what John
[2039.68 --> 2040.90]  is arguing with them.
[2041.34 --> 2041.70]  He's saying
[2041.70 --> 2042.44]  your identity,
[2042.68 --> 2043.78]  who you really are,
[2044.26 --> 2045.10]  I know it
[2045.10 --> 2046.50]  through your actions.
[2047.72 --> 2049.22]  So that means
[2049.22 --> 2050.80]  we can say,
[2051.02 --> 2051.16]  you know,
[2051.20 --> 2052.02]  we love Jesus,
[2052.22 --> 2053.02]  we want to
[2053.02 --> 2054.04]  be a Christian,
[2054.54 --> 2056.60]  but if your life
[2056.60 --> 2057.96]  says something different,
[2058.50 --> 2059.98]  you're just deceiving yourself
[2059.98 --> 2061.34]  and you're deceiving others.
[2062.64 --> 2062.96]  And friends,
[2063.00 --> 2063.86]  this tells us that,
[2064.06 --> 2064.70]  kind of the nature
[2064.70 --> 2065.32]  of belief.
[2066.32 --> 2067.36]  Belief and faith
[2067.36 --> 2067.98]  is not some,
[2067.98 --> 2068.40]  you know,
[2068.96 --> 2070.08]  ethereal thing
[2070.08 --> 2071.26]  that is kind of
[2071.26 --> 2072.22]  hard to hold on to,
[2072.32 --> 2073.24]  maybe it just exists
[2073.24 --> 2073.88]  in our hearts
[2073.88 --> 2074.68]  or in our minds.
[2075.18 --> 2076.36]  That's not belief.
[2076.60 --> 2077.88]  Belief is how you live.
[2078.38 --> 2079.48]  And how you live
[2079.48 --> 2082.26]  reveals what you truly believe
[2082.26 --> 2083.20]  and who you are.
[2084.24 --> 2084.58]  And so,
[2084.96 --> 2085.18]  you know,
[2085.24 --> 2085.78]  you can say,
[2086.00 --> 2087.06]  I love the Canucks,
[2087.70 --> 2089.02]  but if you don't
[2089.02 --> 2089.78]  go to their games,
[2090.22 --> 2091.16]  if you don't wear
[2091.16 --> 2091.90]  the cap
[2091.90 --> 2092.46]  in the hoodie,
[2093.10 --> 2094.12]  if you're always
[2094.12 --> 2095.42]  kind of putting them down
[2095.42 --> 2096.54]  and maybe cheering
[2096.54 --> 2097.40]  for other teams,
[2097.92 --> 2098.54]  you don't really
[2098.54 --> 2099.24]  love the Canucks.
[2099.88 --> 2101.14]  You may say you do,
[2101.74 --> 2102.60]  but you don't.
[2103.76 --> 2104.28]  And John,
[2104.42 --> 2105.08]  in the same way,
[2105.16 --> 2105.94]  is basically saying
[2105.94 --> 2106.34]  to them,
[2107.06 --> 2107.66]  you're saying
[2107.66 --> 2108.50]  you're sons of Abraham,
[2109.30 --> 2110.54]  but I don't believe you.
[2110.66 --> 2111.26]  I don't believe
[2111.26 --> 2112.28]  the words that you're saying
[2112.28 --> 2113.38]  because your actions
[2113.38 --> 2115.02]  are saying something different.
[2116.54 --> 2116.78]  You know,
[2116.82 --> 2118.04]  and we all know people
[2118.04 --> 2120.30]  in our culture,
[2120.48 --> 2120.66]  you know,
[2120.68 --> 2121.54]  it's filled with people.
[2121.54 --> 2123.32]  who say one thing
[2123.32 --> 2124.56]  in their mouths,
[2124.64 --> 2125.46]  but their behavior
[2125.46 --> 2127.16]  is something different.
[2128.10 --> 2128.58]  You know,
[2128.60 --> 2129.24]  as an example,
[2129.38 --> 2131.42]  there's the environmental activist
[2131.42 --> 2134.40]  who flies around the world,
[2134.54 --> 2135.68]  drives a big SUV,
[2136.20 --> 2137.22]  and lives in a mansion
[2137.22 --> 2137.96]  that uses way
[2137.96 --> 2138.94]  of too much energy
[2138.94 --> 2139.66]  and, you know,
[2139.72 --> 2140.74]  eats steak for dinner
[2140.74 --> 2141.24]  every night.
[2142.06 --> 2143.20]  And the media loves
[2143.20 --> 2143.94]  to dig up
[2143.94 --> 2145.62]  these kind of exposés.
[2146.26 --> 2146.76]  And really,
[2146.86 --> 2148.28]  whatever area of life
[2148.28 --> 2148.82]  you look at,
[2148.88 --> 2149.86]  whether it's politics
[2149.86 --> 2150.46]  and government,
[2150.46 --> 2151.88]  whether it's business
[2151.88 --> 2152.98]  or academia,
[2153.52 --> 2154.38]  you can find
[2154.38 --> 2155.50]  these kind of stories.
[2156.74 --> 2158.18]  And we need to understand
[2158.18 --> 2158.88]  something, though,
[2159.30 --> 2160.76]  that the difference
[2160.76 --> 2162.06]  between a person
[2162.06 --> 2163.10]  who follows Jesus
[2163.10 --> 2164.74]  and a person
[2164.74 --> 2165.64]  who doesn't
[2165.64 --> 2167.36]  is not that the person
[2167.36 --> 2168.30]  who follows Jesus
[2168.30 --> 2169.38]  is never a hypocrite.
[2170.48 --> 2170.94]  Right?
[2170.94 --> 2171.44]  The difference
[2171.44 --> 2172.18]  between a person
[2172.18 --> 2173.04]  who follows Jesus
[2173.04 --> 2174.78]  is that they are trying
[2174.78 --> 2176.04]  to shorten the distance
[2176.04 --> 2178.00]  between their hypocrisy,
[2178.38 --> 2179.44]  they're not living up
[2179.44 --> 2180.40]  to their own ideals,
[2181.10 --> 2181.82]  and their repentance.
[2183.24 --> 2183.40]  You know,
[2183.46 --> 2184.62]  and so one common objection
[2184.62 --> 2185.24]  to Christianity
[2185.24 --> 2186.10]  that I've heard
[2186.10 --> 2187.20]  and probably you have heard
[2187.20 --> 2188.52]  is that,
[2188.64 --> 2189.00]  oh, you know,
[2189.04 --> 2190.76]  I don't want to come to church
[2190.76 --> 2192.00]  because there are so many
[2192.00 --> 2193.28]  hypocrites in the church.
[2193.28 --> 2195.34]  And the response
[2195.34 --> 2195.98]  to that
[2195.98 --> 2197.34]  is,
[2197.56 --> 2198.68]  of course there are.
[2199.40 --> 2199.52]  Right?
[2199.78 --> 2200.92]  Just like there are
[2200.92 --> 2202.62]  anywhere else in life.
[2203.20 --> 2203.80]  It's part
[2203.80 --> 2205.08]  of being human
[2205.08 --> 2206.78]  not to live up
[2206.78 --> 2207.44]  to our own
[2207.44 --> 2208.26]  greatest ideals.
[2209.26 --> 2210.20]  Of course,
[2210.34 --> 2210.76]  Christians
[2210.76 --> 2212.42]  are sometimes hypocrites.
[2213.18 --> 2214.46]  The difference is
[2214.46 --> 2215.46]  that the church
[2215.46 --> 2216.94]  ought to be
[2216.94 --> 2219.28]  full of recovering hypocrites
[2219.28 --> 2221.94]  or honest hypocrites
[2221.94 --> 2224.14]  who are not in denial
[2224.14 --> 2225.94]  about their hypocrisy.
[2226.80 --> 2227.72]  Christians should be ones,
[2227.78 --> 2228.02]  again,
[2228.14 --> 2228.62]  who are trying
[2228.62 --> 2230.06]  to decrease the distance
[2230.06 --> 2230.96]  between
[2230.96 --> 2232.54]  when they realize
[2232.54 --> 2233.78]  they're not living up
[2233.78 --> 2234.38]  to the life
[2234.38 --> 2235.58]  that God has called them to
[2235.58 --> 2237.72]  and repenting of it.
[2238.24 --> 2238.78]  There should be
[2238.78 --> 2239.70]  a life of
[2239.70 --> 2240.50]  quickly
[2240.50 --> 2241.68]  not only having
[2241.68 --> 2242.72]  these ideals
[2242.72 --> 2244.36]  about what it means
[2244.36 --> 2245.04]  to be a Christian,
[2245.16 --> 2245.40]  what it means
[2245.40 --> 2246.20]  to be a son of Abraham,
[2246.72 --> 2248.08]  but of then repenting
[2248.08 --> 2248.98]  and trying to
[2248.98 --> 2250.10]  follow those things
[2250.10 --> 2251.46]  and produce this life
[2251.46 --> 2252.52]  of repentance.
[2254.46 --> 2255.72]  So what John the Baptist
[2255.72 --> 2256.44]  is doing
[2256.44 --> 2257.36]  here
[2257.36 --> 2258.20]  is he's trying
[2258.20 --> 2259.30]  to wake up
[2259.30 --> 2260.80]  the spiritually complacent.
[2261.98 --> 2262.20]  Right?
[2262.30 --> 2263.06]  The spiritually
[2263.06 --> 2264.58]  self-satisfied.
[2264.76 --> 2265.16]  So he uses
[2265.16 --> 2266.96]  this harsh language
[2266.96 --> 2268.36]  you brood of vipers.
[2268.80 --> 2269.42]  He's trying to
[2269.42 --> 2270.36]  wake them up
[2270.36 --> 2271.30]  and say
[2271.30 --> 2272.40]  all of you
[2272.40 --> 2273.92]  need true repentance.
[2275.98 --> 2276.94]  So the question
[2276.94 --> 2277.78]  for us is
[2277.78 --> 2279.46]  is that
[2279.46 --> 2280.26]  you this morning?
[2281.38 --> 2282.12]  Have you
[2282.12 --> 2283.00]  grown very
[2283.00 --> 2283.62]  comfortable
[2283.62 --> 2285.40]  with the places
[2285.40 --> 2286.20]  that you have
[2286.20 --> 2286.60]  given
[2286.60 --> 2288.14]  to God
[2288.14 --> 2288.76]  in your life?
[2290.04 --> 2290.70]  Have you
[2290.70 --> 2291.36]  grown very
[2291.36 --> 2291.98]  satisfied
[2291.98 --> 2292.88]  with where
[2292.88 --> 2293.80]  Jesus sits
[2293.80 --> 2295.24]  in your life?
[2295.32 --> 2295.84]  You feel like
[2295.84 --> 2296.66]  well I'm
[2296.66 --> 2297.78]  a son of God
[2297.78 --> 2298.62]  it's fine
[2298.62 --> 2299.22]  I'm okay.
[2299.76 --> 2300.76]  Where actually
[2300.76 --> 2301.96]  your life is
[2301.96 --> 2303.32]  maybe a bit
[2303.32 --> 2303.96]  like a frozen
[2303.96 --> 2304.46]  waterfall
[2304.46 --> 2305.44]  where it has
[2305.44 --> 2305.96]  the appearance
[2305.96 --> 2306.50]  of life
[2306.50 --> 2307.60]  but it's
[2307.60 --> 2308.06]  actually
[2308.06 --> 2309.48]  still
[2309.48 --> 2310.08]  and not moving
[2310.08 --> 2310.48]  and we can
[2310.48 --> 2310.88]  all feel
[2310.88 --> 2311.30]  stuck
[2311.30 --> 2312.42]  like this
[2312.42 --> 2313.08]  in our
[2313.08 --> 2313.80]  spiritual lives
[2313.80 --> 2314.90]  but if that
[2314.90 --> 2315.28]  is you
[2315.28 --> 2315.84]  John is
[2315.84 --> 2316.50]  trying to
[2316.50 --> 2317.10]  wake us up.
[2318.18 --> 2318.48]  He's trying
[2318.48 --> 2318.96]  to break
[2318.96 --> 2319.56]  through our
[2319.56 --> 2320.10]  frozen
[2320.10 --> 2320.74]  outward
[2320.74 --> 2321.36]  appearance
[2321.36 --> 2321.84]  of spiritual
[2321.84 --> 2322.28]  life
[2322.28 --> 2323.06]  or frozen
[2323.06 --> 2323.48]  outward
[2323.48 --> 2323.92]  appearance
[2323.92 --> 2324.50]  maybe as
[2324.50 --> 2325.08]  a church
[2325.08 --> 2325.54]  of spiritual
[2325.54 --> 2325.94]  life
[2325.94 --> 2327.10]  or individually
[2327.10 --> 2328.34]  and he's
[2328.34 --> 2328.62]  trying to
[2328.62 --> 2329.02]  call us
[2329.02 --> 2329.46]  to true
[2329.46 --> 2329.96]  repentance
[2329.96 --> 2331.30]  which will
[2331.30 --> 2332.18]  then lead
[2332.18 --> 2333.04]  to producing
[2333.04 --> 2333.72]  fruit
[2333.72 --> 2335.24]  real spiritual
[2335.24 --> 2335.76]  fruit in our
[2335.76 --> 2336.10]  lives.
[2337.94 --> 2338.44]  And so that's
[2338.44 --> 2339.20]  the first point
[2339.20 --> 2340.62]  that we all
[2340.62 --> 2341.80]  need life
[2341.80 --> 2343.30]  but then the
[2343.30 --> 2344.30]  question then
[2344.30 --> 2345.22]  is well where
[2345.22 --> 2345.94]  does this life
[2345.94 --> 2346.44]  come from?
[2346.92 --> 2347.52]  How can we
[2347.52 --> 2349.26]  how can we be
[2349.26 --> 2349.98]  this flowing
[2349.98 --> 2351.26]  stream that
[2351.26 --> 2352.24]  produces life?
[2353.68 --> 2354.64]  And so the
[2354.64 --> 2355.26]  answer I think
[2355.26 --> 2355.92]  is also in this
[2355.92 --> 2356.20]  text.
[2356.30 --> 2356.70]  If you look
[2356.70 --> 2357.54]  at verse 15
[2357.54 --> 2358.54]  you see that
[2358.54 --> 2359.08]  John
[2359.08 --> 2360.00]  sorry you see
[2360.00 --> 2360.32]  that the
[2360.32 --> 2360.80]  people who
[2360.80 --> 2361.66]  are hearing
[2361.66 --> 2362.00]  John's
[2362.00 --> 2362.46]  message
[2362.46 --> 2363.92]  they wonder
[2363.92 --> 2364.86]  if John
[2364.86 --> 2365.34]  might be
[2365.34 --> 2365.86]  the Messiah.
[2367.26 --> 2368.02]  John answers
[2368.02 --> 2369.76]  I baptize
[2369.76 --> 2370.00]  you with
[2370.00 --> 2370.36]  water
[2370.36 --> 2371.78]  but one
[2371.78 --> 2372.32]  who is more
[2372.32 --> 2373.02]  powerful than
[2373.02 --> 2374.08]  I will come
[2374.08 --> 2374.72]  the straps
[2374.72 --> 2375.10]  of whose
[2375.10 --> 2375.66]  sandals I
[2375.66 --> 2376.18]  am not even
[2376.18 --> 2376.74]  worthy to
[2376.74 --> 2377.20]  untie
[2377.20 --> 2378.54]  he will
[2378.54 --> 2379.30]  baptize you
[2379.30 --> 2379.82]  with what?
[2380.58 --> 2381.28]  With the
[2381.28 --> 2382.00]  Holy Spirit
[2382.00 --> 2383.08]  and with
[2383.08 --> 2383.42]  fire.
[2384.90 --> 2385.36]  So friends
[2385.36 --> 2385.78]  what John
[2385.78 --> 2386.28]  is saying
[2386.28 --> 2387.20]  is this
[2387.20 --> 2388.26]  he's saying
[2388.26 --> 2388.92]  look
[2388.92 --> 2389.44]  you all
[2389.44 --> 2389.66]  this
[2389.66 --> 2390.00]  crowds
[2390.00 --> 2390.30]  you have
[2390.30 --> 2390.78]  come to
[2390.78 --> 2391.12]  me
[2391.12 --> 2392.30]  and all
[2392.30 --> 2393.00]  I have
[2393.00 --> 2393.48]  to offer
[2393.48 --> 2393.82]  you
[2393.82 --> 2394.60]  is
[2394.60 --> 2395.14]  baptism
[2395.14 --> 2395.44]  with
[2395.44 --> 2395.84]  water.
[2396.34 --> 2396.72]  It's just
[2396.72 --> 2397.32]  an outward
[2397.32 --> 2397.96]  sign.
[2398.38 --> 2398.60]  It's an
[2398.60 --> 2399.36]  external
[2399.36 --> 2399.90]  cleansing.
[2400.68 --> 2400.90]  And what
[2400.90 --> 2401.42]  he's saying
[2401.42 --> 2402.46]  is this
[2402.46 --> 2403.18]  isn't even
[2403.18 --> 2403.82]  close to
[2403.82 --> 2404.10]  what you
[2404.10 --> 2404.70]  really need.
[2405.40 --> 2406.10]  This dip
[2406.10 --> 2406.66]  in the river
[2406.66 --> 2407.86]  can't change
[2407.86 --> 2408.22]  you from
[2408.22 --> 2409.02]  the inside.
[2409.68 --> 2410.14]  It can't
[2410.14 --> 2410.54]  change the
[2410.54 --> 2411.20]  human heart.
[2412.04 --> 2412.80]  The problem
[2412.80 --> 2413.40]  that we all
[2413.40 --> 2414.20]  have runs
[2414.20 --> 2415.40]  far deeper
[2415.40 --> 2415.92]  than that.
[2416.90 --> 2417.24]  What you
[2417.24 --> 2418.64]  need is a
[2418.64 --> 2419.66]  baptism with
[2419.66 --> 2420.26]  the Spirit
[2420.26 --> 2421.12]  of God
[2421.12 --> 2421.94]  on the
[2421.94 --> 2422.48]  inside.
[2423.18 --> 2423.78]  Not just
[2423.78 --> 2424.04]  to make
[2424.04 --> 2424.72]  you clean
[2424.72 --> 2425.46]  you need
[2425.46 --> 2425.86]  the Spirit
[2425.86 --> 2426.14]  of God
[2426.14 --> 2426.56]  to come
[2426.56 --> 2427.02]  and make
[2427.02 --> 2428.22]  you totally
[2428.22 --> 2428.56]  new.
[2430.44 --> 2430.84]  And notice
[2430.84 --> 2431.46]  what he says
[2431.46 --> 2432.16]  in verse 9
[2432.16 --> 2442.30]  In other
[2442.30 --> 2442.70]  words
[2442.70 --> 2443.24]  unless you
[2443.24 --> 2443.76]  have this
[2443.76 --> 2444.48]  new life
[2444.48 --> 2445.02]  that comes
[2445.02 --> 2445.44]  from the
[2445.44 --> 2445.88]  Spirit's
[2445.88 --> 2446.64]  work within
[2446.64 --> 2446.98]  you
[2446.98 --> 2448.00]  we are
[2448.00 --> 2448.72]  cut off
[2448.72 --> 2449.40]  from God
[2449.40 --> 2450.78]  who is
[2450.78 --> 2451.34]  the source
[2451.34 --> 2451.96]  of life.
[2453.84 --> 2454.10]  And so
[2454.10 --> 2454.62]  again if you
[2454.62 --> 2455.08]  remember that
[2455.08 --> 2455.84]  waterfall we
[2455.84 --> 2456.56]  began with
[2456.56 --> 2457.52]  it had all
[2457.52 --> 2458.36]  the appearances
[2458.36 --> 2459.20]  of life
[2459.20 --> 2460.28]  and yet
[2460.28 --> 2460.70]  there was
[2460.70 --> 2461.26]  deadness.
[2462.16 --> 2462.48]  And the
[2462.48 --> 2463.14]  only way
[2463.14 --> 2463.58]  that you
[2463.58 --> 2463.98]  and I
[2463.98 --> 2464.34]  will be
[2464.34 --> 2465.00]  able to
[2465.00 --> 2465.52]  produce
[2465.52 --> 2465.98]  true
[2465.98 --> 2466.38]  spiritual
[2466.38 --> 2466.88]  fruit
[2466.88 --> 2467.28]  in our
[2467.28 --> 2467.68]  lives
[2467.68 --> 2468.70]  is if
[2468.70 --> 2469.02]  we
[2469.02 --> 2469.62]  become
[2469.62 --> 2470.54]  a whole
[2470.54 --> 2470.88]  new
[2470.88 --> 2471.22]  kind
[2471.22 --> 2471.38]  of
[2471.38 --> 2471.60]  tree.
[2471.72 --> 2471.98]  If we
[2471.98 --> 2472.16]  have
[2472.16 --> 2472.64]  new
[2472.64 --> 2473.58]  roots.
[2474.98 --> 2475.16]  And so
[2475.16 --> 2475.56]  how does
[2475.56 --> 2476.00]  that happen?
[2476.84 --> 2477.38]  We can't
[2477.38 --> 2477.62]  change
[2477.62 --> 2477.96]  ourselves
[2477.96 --> 2478.36]  remember
[2478.36 --> 2479.24]  we all
[2479.24 --> 2479.64]  need
[2479.64 --> 2480.36]  forgiveness.
[2481.12 --> 2482.02]  We can't
[2482.02 --> 2482.90]  claim Abraham
[2482.90 --> 2483.38]  as our
[2483.38 --> 2483.62]  father.
[2483.76 --> 2484.06]  We can't
[2484.06 --> 2484.34]  look to
[2484.34 --> 2484.66]  our own
[2484.66 --> 2484.90]  moral
[2484.90 --> 2485.28]  goodness.
[2485.96 --> 2486.10]  John
[2486.10 --> 2486.44]  is calling
[2486.44 --> 2486.98]  all of
[2486.98 --> 2487.34]  us
[2487.34 --> 2488.50]  to turn
[2488.50 --> 2489.02]  to God
[2489.02 --> 2489.46]  to receive
[2489.46 --> 2489.94]  something that
[2489.94 --> 2490.32]  we do
[2490.32 --> 2490.90]  not have.
[2490.90 --> 2490.94]  life.
[2492.06 --> 2492.44]  And that's
[2492.44 --> 2493.12]  why our
[2493.12 --> 2494.32]  longing for
[2494.32 --> 2495.06]  fruitfulness
[2495.06 --> 2495.96]  for life
[2495.96 --> 2497.32]  is fulfilled
[2497.32 --> 2497.90]  in Jesus.
[2498.92 --> 2499.28]  And our
[2499.28 --> 2499.96]  passage ends
[2499.96 --> 2500.46]  like this.
[2500.54 --> 2500.84]  It says
[2500.84 --> 2501.16]  and with
[2501.16 --> 2501.88]  many other
[2501.88 --> 2502.60]  words John
[2502.60 --> 2503.34]  proclaimed
[2503.34 --> 2504.46]  the good
[2504.46 --> 2504.94]  news
[2504.94 --> 2506.68]  of life.
[2507.68 --> 2508.08]  He didn't say
[2508.08 --> 2508.26]  life.
[2508.32 --> 2508.60]  He says the
[2508.60 --> 2509.24]  good news.
[2509.38 --> 2510.30]  He is proclaiming
[2510.30 --> 2510.84]  the good news.
[2511.22 --> 2511.64]  And the good
[2511.64 --> 2512.14]  news of this
[2512.14 --> 2513.68]  passage is
[2513.68 --> 2514.24]  that Jesus
[2514.24 --> 2515.16]  didn't come
[2515.16 --> 2515.78]  to bring the
[2515.78 --> 2516.80]  acts of God's
[2516.80 --> 2517.40]  divine judgment.
[2517.40 --> 2517.48]  judgment.
[2518.26 --> 2518.90]  But instead
[2518.90 --> 2519.82]  he came to
[2519.82 --> 2520.62]  change us
[2520.62 --> 2521.68]  and to make
[2521.68 --> 2522.04]  us new
[2522.04 --> 2522.40]  from the
[2522.40 --> 2522.88]  inside.
[2524.16 --> 2524.28]  Right?
[2524.36 --> 2524.98]  Jesus came
[2524.98 --> 2525.78]  not to bring
[2525.78 --> 2526.66]  judgment on
[2526.66 --> 2527.38]  us but he
[2527.38 --> 2527.80]  came to
[2527.80 --> 2528.44]  bear judgment
[2528.44 --> 2529.20]  for us.
[2529.76 --> 2530.28]  He came to
[2530.28 --> 2531.36]  place himself
[2531.36 --> 2532.66]  under that
[2532.66 --> 2533.40]  axe that is
[2533.40 --> 2533.88]  at the root
[2533.88 --> 2534.36]  of the tree.
[2535.74 --> 2536.80]  Think about
[2536.80 --> 2537.10]  Jesus'
[2537.30 --> 2537.58]  life.
[2537.76 --> 2539.24]  Jesus was
[2539.24 --> 2539.94]  the only
[2539.94 --> 2541.44]  tree to
[2541.44 --> 2542.62]  ever really
[2542.62 --> 2543.36]  produce good
[2543.36 --> 2543.64]  fruit.
[2544.48 --> 2545.12]  Jesus was
[2545.12 --> 2545.70]  the actual
[2545.70 --> 2546.46]  true and
[2546.46 --> 2547.88]  final son
[2547.88 --> 2548.54]  of Abraham.
[2549.80 --> 2550.94]  Jesus abided
[2550.94 --> 2552.12]  with God
[2552.12 --> 2552.82]  his father
[2552.82 --> 2553.60]  in every
[2553.60 --> 2554.02]  way.
[2554.62 --> 2554.80]  Not
[2554.80 --> 2555.50]  complacently
[2555.50 --> 2556.02]  but giving
[2556.02 --> 2557.02]  every area
[2557.02 --> 2557.64]  in submission
[2557.64 --> 2558.56]  to his
[2558.56 --> 2559.24]  heavenly father.
[2560.24 --> 2560.90]  But on the
[2560.90 --> 2561.54]  cross Jesus
[2561.54 --> 2562.20]  took the
[2562.20 --> 2562.62]  acts of
[2562.62 --> 2562.98]  God's
[2562.98 --> 2563.44]  divine
[2563.44 --> 2564.60]  judgment
[2564.60 --> 2566.14]  so that by
[2566.14 --> 2566.68]  turning to
[2566.68 --> 2567.30]  him we can
[2567.30 --> 2567.94]  receive his
[2567.94 --> 2568.32]  forgiveness
[2568.32 --> 2568.82]  and his
[2568.82 --> 2569.24]  righteousness.
[2570.46 --> 2570.84]  And friends
[2570.84 --> 2571.30]  when we
[2571.30 --> 2572.86]  receive this
[2572.86 --> 2573.54]  baptism with
[2573.54 --> 2573.84]  the Holy
[2573.84 --> 2574.52]  Spirit this
[2574.52 --> 2576.42]  cleansing that
[2576.42 --> 2577.10]  Jesus came to
[2577.10 --> 2578.10]  bring it
[2578.10 --> 2578.86]  makes us new.
[2579.52 --> 2580.26]  It makes us new
[2580.26 --> 2580.82]  where we can
[2580.82 --> 2581.48]  become true
[2581.48 --> 2581.96]  children of
[2581.96 --> 2582.52]  Abraham not
[2582.52 --> 2583.88]  again by our
[2583.88 --> 2584.80]  own living up
[2584.80 --> 2585.24]  to our own
[2585.24 --> 2586.76]  expectations but
[2586.76 --> 2587.30]  because of
[2587.30 --> 2587.56]  Jesus'
[2587.84 --> 2589.88]  righteousness in
[2589.88 --> 2590.36]  his goodness
[2590.36 --> 2590.76]  alone.
[2592.04 --> 2592.56]  And when we
[2592.56 --> 2593.40]  receive this
[2593.40 --> 2594.82]  new life we
[2594.82 --> 2595.72]  will not only
[2595.72 --> 2596.68]  have the
[2596.68 --> 2597.32]  appearance of
[2597.32 --> 2598.68]  life but the
[2598.68 --> 2599.70]  reality of it.
[2600.46 --> 2601.48]  His life
[2601.48 --> 2602.56]  flowing in
[2602.56 --> 2603.30]  us and
[2603.30 --> 2603.96]  flowing through
[2603.96 --> 2604.64]  us producing
[2604.64 --> 2605.44]  beautiful fruit.
[2606.70 --> 2607.10]  So my
[2607.10 --> 2607.80]  friends my
[2607.80 --> 2608.92]  hope and my
[2608.92 --> 2609.52]  wish my
[2609.52 --> 2611.12]  prayer for
[2611.12 --> 2612.82]  this year is
[2612.82 --> 2613.24]  that it would
[2613.24 --> 2613.82]  be a year of
[2613.82 --> 2615.40]  fruitfulness in
[2615.40 --> 2617.32]  our lives in
[2617.32 --> 2618.80]  our church as
[2618.80 --> 2620.32]  we find
[2620.32 --> 2622.20]  Christ to
[2622.20 --> 2622.66]  be the
[2622.66 --> 2623.44]  fulfillment of
[2623.44 --> 2624.24]  our all of
[2624.24 --> 2624.92]  our longings and
[2624.92 --> 2626.26]  our desires and
[2626.26 --> 2627.06]  that he would be
[2627.06 --> 2628.90]  our life that our
[2628.90 --> 2629.52]  life would be in
[2629.52 --> 2629.72]  him.
[2629.72 --> 2631.02]  So that's our
[2631.02 --> 2631.28]  prayer.
[2631.72 --> 2632.44]  Let's pray
[2632.44 --> 2632.90]  together for
[2632.90 --> 2633.10]  that.
[2637.62 --> 2638.68]  Lord we have
[2638.68 --> 2640.76]  no righteousness
[2640.76 --> 2641.56]  of our own.
[2641.70 --> 2642.28]  We look to our
[2642.28 --> 2642.96]  own traditions
[2642.96 --> 2643.74]  maybe as
[2643.74 --> 2645.36]  individuals, our
[2645.36 --> 2646.54]  heritage, our
[2646.54 --> 2647.28]  church.
[2649.06 --> 2650.50]  And Lord it's
[2650.50 --> 2651.44]  not something that
[2651.44 --> 2653.32]  we ultimately can
[2653.32 --> 2654.22]  find our life in
[2654.22 --> 2655.22]  God's
[2655.22 --> 2655.56]  love.
[2655.56 --> 2656.34]  Because ultimately
[2656.34 --> 2657.14]  Lord we need
[2657.14 --> 2657.52]  you.
[2659.16 --> 2660.26]  We need your
[2660.26 --> 2660.78]  forgiveness.
[2661.52 --> 2662.00]  We need to
[2662.00 --> 2663.12]  repent of all the
[2663.12 --> 2663.74]  areas in our
[2663.74 --> 2665.06]  lives where we've
[2665.06 --> 2666.12]  grown complacent,
[2666.78 --> 2667.38]  where we've kind
[2667.38 --> 2670.38]  of assumed that
[2670.38 --> 2670.82]  you would be
[2670.82 --> 2671.20]  there.
[2672.06 --> 2672.74]  But Lord you
[2672.74 --> 2674.42]  require us Lord to
[2674.42 --> 2675.44]  produce fruit in
[2675.44 --> 2675.86]  keeping with
[2675.86 --> 2676.26]  repentance.
[2676.80 --> 2677.88]  That our lives
[2677.88 --> 2678.70]  would match up with
[2678.70 --> 2679.34]  our words.
[2680.18 --> 2680.82]  Lord we can't do
[2680.82 --> 2681.46]  that on our own.
[2681.46 --> 2683.60]  We need this new
[2683.60 --> 2684.50]  life that comes
[2684.50 --> 2685.04]  from our Lord
[2685.04 --> 2685.32]  Jesus.
[2685.70 --> 2686.14]  We need a
[2686.14 --> 2686.80]  righteousness that
[2686.80 --> 2687.44]  is not our own
[2687.44 --> 2688.38]  but comes from the
[2688.38 --> 2688.74]  outside.
[2689.46 --> 2690.38]  We need new
[2690.38 --> 2691.72]  waters of life
[2691.72 --> 2692.74]  welling up within
[2692.74 --> 2693.20]  us.
[2694.08 --> 2694.70]  And so Lord we
[2694.70 --> 2695.30]  look to you.
[2696.02 --> 2696.60]  And Lord would you
[2696.60 --> 2697.34]  fulfill us?
[2698.00 --> 2698.66]  Would you shake
[2698.66 --> 2699.74]  us out this year
[2699.74 --> 2700.52]  of whatever
[2700.52 --> 2701.84]  spiritual complacency
[2701.84 --> 2703.04]  we may have
[2703.04 --> 2703.86]  gotten used to?
[2704.52 --> 2706.08]  And Lord would we
[2706.08 --> 2707.26]  just be devoted to
[2707.26 --> 2708.12]  you as our Lord
[2708.12 --> 2709.68]  and in freedom
[2709.68 --> 2710.44]  live for you in
[2710.44 --> 2711.26]  every area?
[2711.46 --> 2712.68]  We pray for your
[2712.68 --> 2713.44]  health again in
[2713.44 --> 2714.08]  Jesus name.
[2714.70 --> 2715.04]  Amen.
[2715.04 --> 2740.48]  Let Christian friends rejoice
[2740.48 --> 2745.24]  With heart and soul and voice
[2745.24 --> 2749.02]  Give ye heed to what we say
[2749.02 --> 2752.66]  Jesus Christ is born today
[2752.66 --> 2756.52]  Ox and ass before him bow
[2756.52 --> 2760.44]  And he is in the manger now
[2760.44 --> 2763.56]  Christ is born today
[2763.56 --> 2767.40]  Christ is born today
[2767.40 --> 2772.72]  Good Christian friends rejoice
[2772.72 --> 2777.68]  With heart and soul and voice
[2777.68 --> 2781.50]  Now you hear of endless bliss
[2781.50 --> 2785.40]  Jesus Christ was born for this
[2785.40 --> 2789.22]  He has opened heaven's door
[2789.22 --> 2793.22]  And we are blessed forevermore
[2793.22 --> 2797.54]  Christ was born for this
[2797.54 --> 2801.50]  Christ was born for this
[2801.50 --> 2807.22]  Good Christian friends rejoice
[2807.22 --> 2811.22]  With heart and soul and voice
[2811.22 --> 2815.70]  Now you need not fear the grave
[2815.70 --> 2819.72]  Jesus Christ was born to save
[2819.72 --> 2823.60]  Calls you one and calls you all
[2823.60 --> 2827.58]  To gain his everlasting hope
[2827.58 --> 2831.10]  Christ was born to save
[2831.10 --> 2835.58]  Christ was born to save
[2835.58 --> 2845.66]  Please join me as we pray for the new year
[2845.66 --> 2848.44]  Reading the bold print as indicated
[2848.44 --> 2852.82]  God of new life
[2852.82 --> 2855.74]  God of life made new
[2855.74 --> 2859.66]  We begin this new year as we ended the last
[2859.66 --> 2863.34]  Embraced by your spirit of love
[2863.34 --> 2865.54]  Your presence of peace
[2865.54 --> 2867.48]  Your gentle power
[2867.48 --> 2870.98]  We leave behind the old year
[2870.98 --> 2873.60]  In the knowledge that whatever we have done
[2873.60 --> 2875.64]  In the service of selfish desire
[2875.64 --> 2879.68]  Whenever we have participated in injustice
[2879.68 --> 2883.14]  However we have strayed from Jesus' way
[2883.14 --> 2886.14]  You have forgiven us
[2886.14 --> 2891.40]  Lead us now into the abundant life of the new year
[2891.40 --> 2895.74]  Give us eyes to glimpse your presence in each moment
[2895.74 --> 2900.62]  Give us ears to hear the quiet promptings of your spirit
[2900.62 --> 2905.10]  Give us hearts open to the joy and the pain
[2905.10 --> 2907.82]  Of the lives that surround ours
[2907.82 --> 2914.42]  We set our feet once again on the way walked by Jesus
[2914.42 --> 2918.14]  These steps of peace may be difficult
[2918.14 --> 2921.16]  In a terrain that slopes toward violence
[2921.16 --> 2924.56]  These steps of justice may prove tiring
[2924.56 --> 2928.16]  As we walk against the winds of injustice
[2928.16 --> 2931.08]  These steps of love may be painful
[2931.08 --> 2934.30]  With so much hatred to step over and bump up against
[2934.30 --> 2936.84]  Give us the wisdom
[2936.84 --> 2939.00]  Give us the strength
[2939.00 --> 2941.72]  To take these steps anyway
[2941.72 --> 2945.28]  Each day a new step
[2945.28 --> 2949.92]  Each step a faithful movement toward your kingdom
[2949.92 --> 2954.56]  Each step taken only by your grace
[2954.56 --> 2956.56]  Only in your power
[2956.56 --> 2961.16]  Our creator, redeemer, sustainer
[2961.16 --> 2962.32]  Amen
[2962.32 --> 2965.12]  Let's sing
[2965.12 --> 2968.02]  Greet now the swiftly changing year
[2968.02 --> 2973.42]  With joy and penitence
[2973.42 --> 2980.30]  Renown the swiftly changing year
[2980.30 --> 2986.30]  With joy and penitence
[2986.30 --> 2989.02]  Renown the swiftly changing year
[2989.02 --> 2994.42]  Renown the swiftly changing year
[2994.42 --> 2998.92]  With joy and penitence sincere
[2998.92 --> 3001.14]  Rejoice, rejoice
[3001.14 --> 3003.50]  With thanks and grace
[3003.50 --> 3008.22]  Another year of grace
[3008.22 --> 3013.54]  This Jesus came to ensign for
[3013.54 --> 3018.12]  The name of names for us he bore
[3018.12 --> 3020.32]  Rejoice, rejoice
[3020.32 --> 3020.36]  Rejoice, rejoice
[3020.36 --> 3022.74]  With thanks and grace
[3022.74 --> 3027.52]  Another year of grace
[3027.52 --> 3033.12]  His love abundant far exceeds
