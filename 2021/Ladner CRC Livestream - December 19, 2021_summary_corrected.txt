• Two main points from this passage are:
  • What is Paul telling us about the day of his coming?
 • What are the implications for us today?
• The passage discusses a rebellion (apostasy) that must occur before Jesus returns, which is a theme found elsewhere in the New Testament.

• This event is characterized by people abandoning the faith and following deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.

• There are several proposed explanations for what is holding back the Antichrist, including the preaching of the gospel.
• The Antichrist is being held back by God until the gospel is proclaimed to all nations
• Civil authorities can also be seen as restraining lawlessness
• The church, through its actions in the world, may also be holding back lawlessness
• The restraint will eventually be removed and the man of lawlessness will appear
