[210.46 --> 211.38]  Good morning.
[212.56 --> 220.80]  Whether you're here in person or online, you're welcome to join us at this service at Latin Christian Reformed Church here.
[220.80 --> 225.72]  May we all be blessed as we meet together as the Lord's body.
[225.72 --> 255.70]  Before we start, we'll be here in the afternoon.
[255.70 --> 257.70]  We'll be here in the next day.
[257.70 --> 260.62]  We'll be here in the next day.
[260.62 --> 262.62]  We'll be here in the next day.
[262.62 --> 265.54]  We'll be here in the next day.
[265.54 --> 270.46]  We'll be here in the next day.
[270.46 --> 272.46]  We'll be here in the next day.
[272.46 --> 274.46]  We'll be here in the next day.
[274.46 --> 278.38]  We'll be here in the next day.
[278.38 --> 280.38]  Let's pray in the next day.
[280.38 --> 283.30]  Let's pray in the next day.
[283.30 --> 285.30]  We'll be here in the next day.
[285.30 --> 286.30]  We'll be here in the next day.
[286.30 --> 289.22]  We'll be here in the next day.
[289.22 --> 291.22]  We'll be here in the next day.
[291.22 --> 292.22]  Let's pray in the next day.
[292.22 --> 293.22]  We'll be here in the next day.
[293.22 --> 297.22]  Let's pray in the next day.
[297.22 --> 302.22]  This is the Lord's, and all that is in it, the world and those who live in it.
[302.22 --> 309.22]  For we have put it on the sea and established it on the rivers.
[309.22 --> 312.22]  Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord?
[312.22 --> 315.22]  Who shall stand in his holy place?
[315.22 --> 329.22]  Those who have a clean heart and a pure heart, who are false and could swear deceitfully.
[329.22 --> 334.22]  To you who have come now, please rise to receive God's greeting.
[334.22 --> 340.22]  This comes from Revelations 1.
[340.22 --> 358.22]  Grace to you and peace from him who is and was and is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who was the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings of earth.
[358.22 --> 362.22]  And we received God's greeting.
[362.22 --> 368.22]  You may now take a moment to greet each other in whatever way is appropriate in this time of COVID.
[368.22 --> 372.22]  And then remain standing for opening songs.
[372.22 --> 373.22]  Yeah, praise to God's greeting.
[373.22 --> 374.22]  Good morning, Lord.
[374.22 --> 375.22]  Good morning, Lord.
[375.22 --> 375.72]  Good morning, oh mijn her.
[375.72 --> 377.22]  Good morning, Lord.
[377.22 --> 378.22]  Thank you, t.
[378.22 --> 379.22]  Good morning, we all are at P90.
[379.22 --> 382.22]  Great morning, da, till I row myistance.
[382.22 --> 386.22] ť is almost on guard.
[386.22 --> 393.22]  Jesus Christ.
[393.22 --> 395.24]  In the beginning, we'll read our following verse 14 pretty tall by on twenty-uven.
[395.24 --> 396.24]  Amen.
[425.24 --> 427.24]  Amen.
[455.24 --> 457.24]  Amen.
[485.24 --> 487.24]  Amen.
[515.24 --> 517.24]  Amen.
[545.24 --> 547.24]  Amen.
[575.24 --> 577.24]  Amen.
[605.24 --> 607.24]  Amen.
[635.24 --> 637.24]  Amen.
[665.24 --> 667.24]  Amen.
[695.24 --> 697.24]  Amen.
[725.24 --> 727.24]  Amen.
[755.24 --> 757.24]  Amen.
[785.24 --> 787.24]  Amen.
[815.24 --> 817.24]  Amen.
[845.24 --> 847.24]  Amen.
[875.24 --> 877.24]  Amen.
[877.24 --> 884.68]  Having been greeted by God and sung his praise, it is now time to make our confession before
[884.68 --> 885.68]  him.
[885.68 --> 896.32]  Now let us all say together, Almighty and merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from your
[896.32 --> 897.32]  ways.
[897.32 --> 899.32]  We have lost sleep.
[899.32 --> 907.46]  We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts, and we have offended
[907.46 --> 909.46]  against your holy law.
[909.46 --> 916.84]  We have left undone the things we should have done, and we have done the things we should
[916.84 --> 921.84]  not have done, and there is no health in us.
[921.84 --> 929.48]  But you, Lord, have mercy on us, when we confess our faults.
[929.48 --> 938.62]  Restore us that we are penitent according to the promises declared to all mankind in Jesus
[938.62 --> 939.62]  our Lord.
[939.62 --> 949.06]  And grant that from now on we may live godly and righteous life, to the glory of your name.
[949.06 --> 950.06]  Amen.
[950.06 --> 952.62]  Amen.
[952.62 --> 954.12]  Amen.
[954.12 --> 954.84]  Amen.
[954.84 --> 956.98]  Amen.
[956.98 --> 960.16]  Amen.
[960.16 --> 961.28]  Amen.
[961.28 --> 962.56]  Amen.
[962.56 --> 962.72]  Amen.
[962.72 --> 963.18]  Amen.
[963.18 --> 968.72]  Now hear these words from the Apostle John and be comforted.
[968.72 --> 969.72]  Amen.
[969.72 --> 976.14]  If we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[976.14 --> 977.14]  Amen.
[977.14 --> 981.34]  If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just
[981.34 --> 984.22]  and will forgive our sins and purify us
[984.22 --> 986.22]  from all unrighteousness.
[988.56 --> 993.22]  Let us now sing with thankful hearts of our great Savior.
[994.12 --> 997.82]  And after that, the children age three to grade seven
[997.82 --> 1001.60]  are welcome to leave for kids' life, children's worship.
[1007.14 --> 1009.14]  Amen.
[1037.14 --> 1067.14] 
[1067.14 --> 1074.14]  He walks with me and talks with me along once and away.
[1074.14 --> 1082.14]  He lives, He made salvation to impart.
[1082.14 --> 1090.14]  You ask me how I know He lives.
[1090.14 --> 1097.14]  He lives within my soul.
[1097.14 --> 1108.56]  Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, lift up your voice and sing.
[1109.14 --> 1117.28]  Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King.
[1117.28 --> 1125.28]  The hope of all who see Him, the help of all who find.
[1126.28 --> 1134.28]  No other is so loving, so good and kind.
[1134.28 --> 1143.28]  He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today.
[1143.28 --> 1151.28]  He walks with me and talks with me along once and away.
[1151.28 --> 1161.28]  He lives, He lives, salvation to impart.
[1161.28 --> 1166.28]  You ask me how I know He lives.
[1166.28 --> 1176.28]  He lives, He lives within my heart.
[1176.28 --> 1183.28]  always caí untuk memberYou.
[1184.28 --> 1185.70]  Men 1
[1186.32 --> 1189.28] ока be found a comment,
[1191.28 --> 1193.28]  coffee Can be found a place
[1194.28 --> 1197.28]  that ik die
[1198.28 --> 1199.28]  thank you
[1199.28 --> 1201.38] 今日は
[1202.28 --> 1203.08]  where
[1203.08 --> 1223.30]  I'll be reading from Psalm 133, a song of ascents.
[1223.98 --> 1227.68]  How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[1227.68 --> 1237.14]  It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robe.
[1237.72 --> 1241.60]  It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion.
[1242.58 --> 1247.96]  For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.
[1248.86 --> 1250.34]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1250.34 --> 1252.32]  Thanks be to God.
[1257.68 --> 1262.54]  All right, we have a new microphone here, so.
[1267.60 --> 1268.60]  See how it goes.
[1271.40 --> 1277.36]  Well, we are slowly coming to the end of the Psalms of Ascent.
[1277.36 --> 1284.60]  If you've been with us during the summer and now into the early fall, you can maybe imagine we're getting to Jerusalem.
[1285.16 --> 1287.52]  We see it in the distance and we're almost there.
[1288.62 --> 1291.58]  You know, and we're calling this series Songs for the Journey.
[1292.98 --> 1300.42]  And it's that in this journey of life, for followers of Jesus, it is to be a movement towards God.
[1300.42 --> 1307.18]  A movement, I like the phrase in the book of Narnia, further up and further in into our life with God.
[1307.18 --> 1312.74]  But what we also see is that it is a journey together.
[1313.54 --> 1320.32]  It is a journey with our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ on the way.
[1320.32 --> 1333.92]  You can imagine the 12 tribes of Israel with all of their different cultures and languages and clans all making their way together, a diverse group on this pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
[1333.92 --> 1337.76]  And so that is what Psalm 133 is all about.
[1337.84 --> 1338.68]  It's a short Psalm.
[1338.78 --> 1339.62]  It's only three verses.
[1340.02 --> 1341.96]  But oh my goodness, it is so significant.
[1342.44 --> 1345.90]  It is so important for us to hear.
[1345.90 --> 1348.22]  Because it is about unity.
[1349.00 --> 1354.04]  Unity not just in general, not like unity in the world, world peace, anything like that.
[1354.24 --> 1359.88]  But specifically, David here talks about unity in the church family.
[1359.88 --> 1367.04]  Unity in the church that he describes as good and pleasant.
[1368.44 --> 1370.76]  And so friends, this is a song for us as well.
[1370.84 --> 1377.32]  This is a song that we need to take upon our lips and take into our hearts and sing together on our journey.
[1379.10 --> 1383.20]  Especially in this moment when there are, you know, so many challenges.
[1384.12 --> 1386.90]  I think there's always challenges all throughout the ages.
[1387.18 --> 1388.70]  But we have unique challenges.
[1388.70 --> 1390.44]  We have the challenges of COVID.
[1391.60 --> 1397.16]  And the disagreements, the struggles about how do we deal with that as a church.
[1397.88 --> 1403.50]  We have challenges around questions of race, of sexuality, of gender.
[1403.90 --> 1405.28]  These are things in our day.
[1405.60 --> 1409.08]  And there are so many temptations to division and conflict.
[1410.24 --> 1414.62]  So this is a song that God gives us for us to sing together.
[1414.62 --> 1421.52]  We can imagine the ancient pilgrims singing this song together.
[1422.14 --> 1423.48]  Because they needed to.
[1424.04 --> 1428.04]  And they knew that they could not make it to Jerusalem unless they did it together.
[1428.58 --> 1429.90]  So this is the song of unity.
[1430.48 --> 1432.28]  Before we look at it, let's pray together.
[1432.70 --> 1433.42]  Would you pray with me?
[1433.42 --> 1441.50]  Father God, you bless your church with unity.
[1443.26 --> 1447.20]  And Lord, would we experience it among us.
[1447.20 --> 1450.56]  Lord, we ask for it.
[1451.52 --> 1453.26]  We plead for your mercy.
[1454.22 --> 1456.98]  And Lord, it needs to start in our own hearts.
[1457.16 --> 1459.52]  So each one of us, Lord, we come before you.
[1460.56 --> 1467.40]  Asking that you would open our eyes to what you would have us to see from your word about unity.
[1467.40 --> 1468.64]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1468.84 --> 1469.08]  Amen.
[1470.06 --> 1472.00]  So I know we're still only at the end of summer.
[1472.16 --> 1472.94]  But looking ahead.
[1474.24 --> 1476.24]  Have you all seen the Christmas movie?
[1477.08 --> 1478.24]  Christmas Vacation.
[1478.78 --> 1480.40]  The Griswold movie.
[1481.06 --> 1482.04]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[1482.80 --> 1487.14]  It has one very colorful character who is Cousin Eddie.
[1488.08 --> 1488.82]  Cousin Eddie.
[1489.18 --> 1490.48]  You know, we laugh about Cousin Eddie.
[1490.76 --> 1492.00]  He is so different.
[1492.68 --> 1493.40]  He is so strange.
[1494.14 --> 1495.06]  He's kind of a mess.
[1495.06 --> 1500.86]  And Cousin Eddie, you know, he's no problem when he's living 300 miles away.
[1501.62 --> 1506.70]  But then Cousin Eddie in the movie shows up unannounced and says,
[1507.24 --> 1512.02]  I brought my family and we are going to live with you over the holidays.
[1512.56 --> 1514.02]  And maybe even longer than that.
[1515.26 --> 1518.24]  So there's a scene where Clark Griswold says to Cousin Eddie,
[1518.40 --> 1520.96]  you know, after they've been living under the same roof for a while,
[1521.32 --> 1525.00]  he says, Eddie, can I refill your eggnog?
[1525.84 --> 1528.46]  Can I get you something to eat?
[1529.06 --> 1532.04]  Can I take you out into the middle of the desert and leave you for dead?
[1532.38 --> 1534.62]  Does any of those, you know, would any of those serve you?
[1536.06 --> 1539.76]  And I think that's something that we can all relate to.
[1539.86 --> 1541.10]  And not just with family.
[1541.98 --> 1543.34]  But even in the church.
[1543.34 --> 1545.56]  Because what is the church?
[1545.56 --> 1552.22]  The church is a bunch of sinners who have received the grace of the Lord Jesus,
[1552.92 --> 1556.64]  not based on who they are or anything that they have done.
[1557.00 --> 1560.04]  And the church is made up of people of different genders,
[1560.72 --> 1567.74]  of different ethnicities, of classes, of cultures, income levels, personalities, and opinions.
[1567.74 --> 1576.38]  And we have all been called together and bound together in Christ as one.
[1577.18 --> 1578.44]  What could go wrong?
[1578.44 --> 1583.98]  But Jesus, in his high priestly prayer,
[1584.50 --> 1589.02]  hours before he goes to the cross to die for the church,
[1589.54 --> 1591.08]  he prays for us.
[1592.14 --> 1592.98]  And what does he pray?
[1594.06 --> 1595.56]  He prays for our unity.
[1596.96 --> 1599.90]  He prays that we would be one with one another,
[1599.90 --> 1605.32]  just as Christ has made us one with God the Father in himself.
[1606.88 --> 1608.38]  So let's look at this psalm.
[1609.00 --> 1612.30]  This is what was on Jesus' heart,
[1612.78 --> 1614.04]  that we would be one.
[1614.20 --> 1615.40]  He has made us one.
[1616.12 --> 1617.10]  How do we live that out?
[1617.16 --> 1618.22]  How do we experience that?
[1618.38 --> 1619.22]  So let's look at this psalm.
[1619.30 --> 1620.72]  Let's see what it teaches us about unity.
[1621.06 --> 1622.34]  Again, it's only three short verses.
[1622.84 --> 1626.10]  But I think we see here three kind of things I want us to consider together.
[1626.76 --> 1628.48]  First, that unity is difficult.
[1628.48 --> 1630.04]  We have to acknowledge that.
[1630.96 --> 1633.84]  Then that unity is actually delightful.
[1634.70 --> 1637.30]  But most importantly, unity is divine.
[1637.98 --> 1639.16]  So let's look at those.
[1639.52 --> 1641.46]  First, we see that unity is difficult.
[1641.80 --> 1643.64]  Verse one says,
[1644.38 --> 1648.76]  how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[1649.60 --> 1652.50]  And I love how Eugene Peterson puts it in the message.
[1653.00 --> 1653.68]  Go back to that one.
[1654.26 --> 1656.46]  How wonderful and how beautiful
[1656.46 --> 1660.18]  when brothers and sisters get along.
[1661.42 --> 1665.78]  We all know from experience that getting along is wonderful,
[1666.14 --> 1667.98]  but it is also difficult.
[1668.80 --> 1668.96]  Right?
[1669.10 --> 1672.84]  It doesn't come naturally to us.
[1672.84 --> 1675.76]  At the dinner table with my family,
[1676.42 --> 1678.78]  we usually try to hold hands around the table.
[1680.24 --> 1682.84]  And some days that can be incredibly hard.
[1683.00 --> 1684.02]  I don't know if you can imagine.
[1684.56 --> 1686.12]  Some days there is yelling,
[1686.76 --> 1687.52]  there is fighting,
[1687.66 --> 1688.30]  and there is crying
[1688.30 --> 1689.70]  before we eat
[1689.70 --> 1692.06]  because someone's hands feel dirty.
[1692.58 --> 1694.68]  Or someone is being annoying.
[1695.10 --> 1697.04]  Or someone is squeezing too tight
[1697.04 --> 1698.70]  or not tightly enough.
[1698.70 --> 1702.36]  All kinds of things could go off the rails in holding hands.
[1703.86 --> 1704.18]  And you know,
[1704.26 --> 1709.44]  history is stained with accounts and stories of disunity.
[1710.48 --> 1712.12]  It starts all the way back in the beginning,
[1712.30 --> 1713.10]  the Garden of Edom,
[1713.36 --> 1714.56]  where Adam and Eve,
[1714.84 --> 1715.92]  they sin,
[1716.02 --> 1717.68]  they eat the forbidden fruit,
[1717.92 --> 1718.84]  disobeying God.
[1719.40 --> 1720.32]  And then what do they do?
[1720.38 --> 1721.70]  They turn on God,
[1722.12 --> 1723.22]  they turn on one another,
[1723.42 --> 1724.48]  and they even turn on themselves.
[1724.64 --> 1725.64]  And they go off running,
[1726.10 --> 1726.48]  hiding,
[1727.26 --> 1728.36]  covering themselves.
[1729.26 --> 1730.48]  And this is the beginning
[1730.48 --> 1732.78]  of a human history of disunity.
[1734.00 --> 1735.30]  And then we see later in the Bible,
[1735.48 --> 1738.02]  rivalry happens right away with Cain and Abel.
[1738.42 --> 1740.02]  Cain becomes envious of his brother
[1740.02 --> 1741.22]  and murders him.
[1742.66 --> 1743.28]  And then later,
[1743.38 --> 1744.12]  Joseph's brothers,
[1744.12 --> 1745.32]  they become envious of him.
[1745.40 --> 1745.90]  And what do they do?
[1746.12 --> 1747.38]  They sell him into slavery.
[1747.38 --> 1750.62]  And then out in the wilderness,
[1750.92 --> 1752.96]  Moses is trying to fulfill the calling
[1752.96 --> 1754.44]  that God has put on his life
[1754.44 --> 1757.00]  to lead this motley group of Israelites.
[1757.64 --> 1759.86]  And his own brother and sister,
[1760.26 --> 1761.04]  Aaron and Miriam,
[1761.40 --> 1762.26]  they get jealous,
[1762.70 --> 1763.48]  and they turn on him.
[1764.40 --> 1764.92]  And then later,
[1765.00 --> 1766.34]  Israel itself as a people
[1766.34 --> 1768.12]  divides north and south,
[1768.26 --> 1769.68]  the ten tribes of Israel in the north,
[1769.80 --> 1771.02]  the two tribes of Judah in the south.
[1771.28 --> 1772.04]  The Israel itself,
[1772.14 --> 1773.34]  the kingdom itself is divided.
[1775.00 --> 1776.52]  And when the psalmist describes
[1776.52 --> 1777.48]  how great it is
[1777.48 --> 1778.52]  that brothers and sisters
[1778.52 --> 1780.52]  dwell together and get along,
[1780.52 --> 1782.04]  the implication is
[1782.04 --> 1783.32]  that sometimes we don't.
[1784.84 --> 1785.58]  That actually,
[1785.78 --> 1787.50]  we get under each other's skin.
[1787.98 --> 1788.44]  That actually,
[1788.54 --> 1789.50]  unity is difficult.
[1790.48 --> 1792.56]  There's a Peanuts comic strip
[1792.56 --> 1794.74]  where Lucy and Linus
[1794.74 --> 1795.76]  are in their living room.
[1796.76 --> 1798.48]  And Linus is curled up
[1798.48 --> 1799.70]  on the chair
[1799.70 --> 1801.18]  with his book in his lap.
[1801.30 --> 1802.78]  And he's holding his blue blanket,
[1803.20 --> 1804.24]  just minding his own business,
[1804.32 --> 1805.12]  not doing anything.
[1805.12 --> 1806.30]  Like, you know,
[1806.72 --> 1807.34]  obnoxious.
[1808.06 --> 1809.52]  Lucy comes up
[1809.52 --> 1810.80]  and she stands behind him
[1810.80 --> 1812.52]  and she has this irritated look
[1812.52 --> 1813.14]  on her face.
[1814.08 --> 1815.36]  And so she turns to Linus
[1815.36 --> 1815.96]  and says,
[1816.20 --> 1817.70]  it's very strange.
[1818.24 --> 1818.58]  He's like,
[1818.66 --> 1819.62]  what's very strange?
[1820.20 --> 1821.02]  It happens
[1821.02 --> 1822.90]  just by looking at you.
[1823.84 --> 1824.36]  She says,
[1824.38 --> 1824.98]  what happens?
[1825.76 --> 1827.92]  I feel a criticism coming on.
[1827.92 --> 1831.52]  Have you ever felt that
[1831.52 --> 1832.28]  with someone before?
[1832.42 --> 1833.36]  Just looking at them,
[1833.46 --> 1834.36]  just criticism,
[1835.08 --> 1835.82]  welling up.
[1836.78 --> 1838.62]  Maybe spouses with one another
[1838.62 --> 1839.94]  or between siblings
[1839.94 --> 1840.56]  or friends
[1840.56 --> 1841.50]  or classmates.
[1842.90 --> 1844.10]  It can be so easy
[1844.10 --> 1844.72]  to look at someone
[1844.72 --> 1845.62]  you're annoyed with
[1845.62 --> 1847.60]  and feel a criticism coming on.
[1848.08 --> 1849.60]  And it happens in the church too.
[1850.22 --> 1850.44]  Right?
[1850.52 --> 1851.58]  And not just today.
[1852.08 --> 1852.28]  You know,
[1852.32 --> 1854.02]  sometimes we think about
[1854.02 --> 1855.04]  the early church
[1855.04 --> 1855.36]  and like,
[1855.42 --> 1855.56]  oh,
[1855.68 --> 1855.88]  you know,
[1855.92 --> 1856.60]  the early church
[1856.60 --> 1857.92]  when things were pure and good.
[1858.78 --> 1859.96]  But think about
[1859.96 --> 1860.96]  the New Testament.
[1861.18 --> 1861.64]  In Corinth,
[1862.20 --> 1862.96]  members of the church
[1862.96 --> 1863.90]  were suing each other.
[1865.08 --> 1866.14]  Members of the church,
[1866.32 --> 1866.90]  the rich,
[1867.30 --> 1868.26]  were neglecting
[1868.26 --> 1869.74]  and excluding the poor,
[1870.40 --> 1870.54]  right?
[1870.56 --> 1871.86]  So this class division
[1871.86 --> 1874.12]  from the Lord's table.
[1875.20 --> 1876.44]  When Paul talks
[1876.44 --> 1877.24]  to his protege,
[1877.36 --> 1877.68]  Timothy,
[1877.68 --> 1878.24]  he says,
[1878.52 --> 1878.70]  you know,
[1878.74 --> 1879.88]  this church you're going to lead,
[1879.88 --> 1881.88]  they crave controversies
[1882.40 --> 1883.06]  and quarrels.
[1884.02 --> 1884.78]  They crave it.
[1885.04 --> 1885.32]  Right?
[1885.38 --> 1886.60]  They want to fight
[1886.60 --> 1887.24]  with one another.
[1887.50 --> 1887.82]  And he says,
[1887.86 --> 1888.66]  you're going to have to
[1888.66 --> 1889.40]  shepherd that.
[1890.42 --> 1891.68]  In the letter to the Galatians,
[1891.78 --> 1892.68]  Paul has to say,
[1892.98 --> 1893.92]  you Galatian Christians,
[1894.30 --> 1895.80]  stop devouring
[1895.80 --> 1897.98]  and biting one another.
[1898.14 --> 1899.42]  You are going to destroy each other.
[1902.26 --> 1902.94]  This is,
[1903.04 --> 1903.94]  it's right in the Bible.
[1904.86 --> 1907.32]  So what makes unity so hard?
[1908.08 --> 1908.50]  Well,
[1908.50 --> 1909.26]  I think it's right there
[1909.26 --> 1909.82]  in verse one.
[1910.68 --> 1910.90]  It says,
[1911.14 --> 1912.36]  how good and pleasant it is
[1912.36 --> 1913.34]  when God's people
[1913.34 --> 1914.38]  live together in unity.
[1915.04 --> 1915.80]  God's people.
[1916.44 --> 1917.22]  That's the problem.
[1917.58 --> 1918.56]  We are all sinners
[1918.56 --> 1919.82]  living together.
[1920.22 --> 1921.68]  And even in God's people,
[1921.78 --> 1922.72]  we have these seeds
[1922.72 --> 1924.38]  of self-righteousness,
[1924.70 --> 1925.66]  self-centeredness,
[1925.96 --> 1926.70]  self-protection,
[1926.98 --> 1927.90]  self-justification,
[1928.30 --> 1929.02]  self-interest
[1929.02 --> 1931.14]  in every single one of us.
[1931.98 --> 1933.30]  So that's the first point.
[1933.84 --> 1935.14]  That unity is difficult.
[1935.14 --> 1937.64]  And because of disunity,
[1938.26 --> 1939.76]  we miss out
[1939.76 --> 1940.78]  on the blessings
[1940.78 --> 1942.24]  that God intends
[1942.24 --> 1943.26]  for us to have
[1943.26 --> 1944.78]  as we live together
[1944.78 --> 1947.50]  in unity.
[1947.70 --> 1948.64]  We miss out
[1948.64 --> 1949.42]  on that blessing.
[1950.98 --> 1952.00]  And that leads us
[1952.00 --> 1952.94]  to the second point.
[1953.56 --> 1954.70]  Because unity is difficult,
[1954.92 --> 1956.72]  but when we experience it,
[1956.78 --> 1956.92]  you know,
[1957.00 --> 1958.44]  have you ever experienced
[1958.44 --> 1959.40]  the unity
[1959.40 --> 1960.84]  of Christian fellowship?
[1961.68 --> 1962.60]  It is delightful.
[1963.30 --> 1965.44]  Or as David says here,
[1965.86 --> 1966.98]  he's the author of the psalm,
[1966.98 --> 1967.98]  it is good
[1967.98 --> 1969.76]  and it is pleasant.
[1970.54 --> 1971.66]  It is both good and pleasant.
[1971.78 --> 1972.86]  Sometimes things are good,
[1973.72 --> 1974.72]  hamburger, fries.
[1975.16 --> 1975.44]  No, wait.
[1975.90 --> 1976.66]  Good for you.
[1976.78 --> 1977.28]  So not that.
[1977.38 --> 1978.04]  That's pleasant,
[1978.16 --> 1978.90]  but not good.
[1979.66 --> 1980.68]  Going to the dentist
[1980.68 --> 1981.66]  is good,
[1981.72 --> 1982.42]  but not pleasant.
[1983.32 --> 1984.12]  But he says
[1984.12 --> 1984.84]  Christian unity
[1984.84 --> 1986.18]  can actually be both.
[1987.06 --> 1987.76]  Do you believe that?
[1988.62 --> 1990.14]  Good and pleasant.
[1990.34 --> 1990.76]  Good for you
[1990.76 --> 1991.68]  and good.
[1992.06 --> 1992.50]  Fun.
[1993.30 --> 1993.84]  Life-giving.
[1993.84 --> 1993.90]  Life-giving.
[1996.98 --> 1998.30]  So Psalm 133
[1998.30 --> 1999.06]  is really interesting
[1999.06 --> 2000.98]  because it's only three verses.
[2001.26 --> 2002.36]  The entire message
[2002.36 --> 2003.08]  of the psalm
[2003.08 --> 2003.74]  is in verse one.
[2004.70 --> 2005.62]  So then we have
[2005.62 --> 2006.34]  verses two and three.
[2006.48 --> 2007.22]  Well, what are those about?
[2008.00 --> 2009.06]  What they're about
[2009.06 --> 2010.98]  is David then gives us
[2010.98 --> 2012.28]  two images,
[2012.78 --> 2013.48]  two pictures
[2013.48 --> 2015.82]  to illustrate the point,
[2015.90 --> 2016.32]  to illustrate
[2016.32 --> 2017.36]  how good it is
[2017.36 --> 2017.82]  and pleasant
[2017.82 --> 2019.38]  for God's people
[2019.38 --> 2020.00]  to dwell together
[2020.00 --> 2020.44]  in unity.
[2021.28 --> 2022.48]  And these two images,
[2022.48 --> 2024.46]  he talks about oil and dew.
[2025.26 --> 2026.16]  Okay, oil and dew.
[2026.16 --> 2028.20]  So these are the two images
[2028.20 --> 2028.78]  he gives
[2028.78 --> 2029.64]  and let's look at them.
[2030.06 --> 2031.26]  The first one is oil.
[2031.76 --> 2032.82]  And so David says here
[2032.82 --> 2033.46]  in verse two,
[2033.96 --> 2034.86]  this unity
[2034.86 --> 2035.84]  that is good and pleasant,
[2036.08 --> 2036.92]  it is like
[2036.92 --> 2038.82]  precious oil
[2038.82 --> 2039.94]  poured on the head,
[2040.94 --> 2041.50]  running down
[2041.50 --> 2042.16]  on the beard,
[2042.64 --> 2043.34]  running down
[2043.34 --> 2044.44]  on Aaron's beard,
[2044.62 --> 2045.60]  down on the collar
[2045.60 --> 2046.34]  of his robe.
[2048.88 --> 2049.40]  What?
[2050.62 --> 2051.52]  Like this
[2051.52 --> 2052.82]  sounds a little strange
[2052.82 --> 2053.46]  to our ears.
[2053.78 --> 2054.68]  This might not relate
[2054.68 --> 2055.52]  to a lot of us.
[2056.16 --> 2057.44]  I think it might relate
[2057.44 --> 2058.12]  to me a bit more.
[2058.74 --> 2059.78]  And I thought about
[2059.78 --> 2061.18]  pouring oil on my head
[2061.18 --> 2061.94]  just to demonstrate
[2061.94 --> 2062.70]  and then no,
[2062.92 --> 2063.12]  no,
[2063.68 --> 2064.30]  I could do that.
[2064.96 --> 2066.02]  But what in the world
[2066.02 --> 2066.62]  does this mean?
[2067.56 --> 2069.06]  It's actually a reference
[2069.06 --> 2071.14]  to the consecration
[2071.14 --> 2071.86]  of the priests
[2071.86 --> 2072.52]  in the Old Testament.
[2073.48 --> 2073.62]  Right?
[2073.70 --> 2074.50]  So when someone
[2074.50 --> 2075.26]  was called into
[2075.26 --> 2075.86]  the priesthood
[2075.86 --> 2076.98]  out of the line of Aaron,
[2077.08 --> 2078.14]  the Aaronic priests,
[2078.66 --> 2079.94]  they would be anointed
[2079.94 --> 2080.78]  with oil
[2080.78 --> 2081.90]  to signify
[2081.90 --> 2083.74]  that they are set apart
[2083.74 --> 2086.58]  for this holy service,
[2086.98 --> 2087.10]  for,
[2087.28 --> 2088.86]  to serve God's people
[2088.86 --> 2089.68]  and to serve God.
[2090.22 --> 2091.16]  And so the oil
[2091.16 --> 2092.30]  running down the head,
[2092.38 --> 2092.48]  right,
[2092.50 --> 2093.04]  this would happen.
[2093.28 --> 2093.92]  They put the oil
[2093.92 --> 2094.38]  on the head,
[2094.48 --> 2095.00]  consecrate,
[2095.76 --> 2096.64]  and this image
[2096.64 --> 2098.06]  of all of this oil,
[2098.86 --> 2099.16]  right,
[2099.24 --> 2100.82]  it was just running down
[2100.82 --> 2101.52]  on the head,
[2101.60 --> 2101.96]  the beard,
[2102.06 --> 2103.00]  onto his robe,
[2103.46 --> 2103.86]  and this,
[2104.48 --> 2105.50]  and it's a picture,
[2105.68 --> 2106.18]  an image of
[2106.18 --> 2107.80]  total consecration,
[2108.26 --> 2109.14]  totally being,
[2109.54 --> 2109.74]  you know,
[2109.74 --> 2110.78]  it's not just a couple drops.
[2111.54 --> 2112.36]  It's not just a little bit
[2112.36 --> 2113.00]  of holy service.
[2113.10 --> 2113.54]  This is like
[2113.54 --> 2114.92]  your whole life
[2114.92 --> 2116.18]  being consecrated
[2116.18 --> 2116.80]  and set apart
[2116.80 --> 2118.52]  as holy for God.
[2119.82 --> 2120.24]  Okay,
[2120.28 --> 2121.28]  so that's what it means
[2121.28 --> 2122.20]  here.
[2122.40 --> 2123.00]  What does that mean
[2123.00 --> 2123.64]  for us?
[2124.68 --> 2125.02]  Well,
[2125.14 --> 2126.38]  in 1 Peter 2,
[2126.46 --> 2126.94]  verse 9,
[2127.56 --> 2128.50]  when Peter is writing
[2128.50 --> 2129.16]  to the church,
[2129.24 --> 2129.72]  he says,
[2129.86 --> 2130.38]  but you,
[2130.58 --> 2131.42]  in Christ Jesus,
[2131.96 --> 2132.88]  you are
[2132.88 --> 2135.08]  a royal priesthood.
[2136.10 --> 2136.62]  You
[2136.62 --> 2137.70]  are
[2137.70 --> 2138.74]  priests.
[2138.74 --> 2140.84]  So what this means
[2140.84 --> 2141.70]  in terms of unity
[2141.70 --> 2142.24]  is this,
[2142.30 --> 2142.84]  that unity
[2142.84 --> 2143.64]  that is good
[2143.64 --> 2144.06]  and pleasant
[2144.06 --> 2145.68]  comes when we
[2145.68 --> 2146.38]  realize that
[2146.38 --> 2147.12]  in Christ,
[2147.40 --> 2148.34]  every single one
[2148.34 --> 2149.14]  of us in the church
[2149.14 --> 2149.56]  community
[2149.56 --> 2151.36]  is a priest.
[2152.50 --> 2153.48]  All of us
[2153.48 --> 2154.76]  are anointed
[2154.76 --> 2156.10]  by the Holy Spirit.
[2156.50 --> 2157.24]  Every single
[2157.24 --> 2158.44]  member of the church
[2158.44 --> 2159.48]  is set apart
[2159.48 --> 2160.26]  for service
[2160.26 --> 2161.48]  and that we are
[2161.48 --> 2162.06]  to be priests
[2162.06 --> 2162.68]  to one another.
[2163.68 --> 2164.30]  So in terms
[2164.30 --> 2165.04]  of application,
[2165.80 --> 2166.60]  let's think about,
[2167.40 --> 2168.28]  make this real practical,
[2168.28 --> 2168.88]  let's think about
[2168.88 --> 2169.80]  our church right here,
[2169.90 --> 2170.64]  Latin or CRC.
[2171.84 --> 2173.08]  How can we
[2173.08 --> 2174.60]  experience unity
[2174.60 --> 2176.36]  in our
[2176.36 --> 2177.20]  church community?
[2178.20 --> 2179.28]  How does this unity
[2179.28 --> 2179.94]  that is good
[2179.94 --> 2180.40]  and pleasant
[2180.40 --> 2181.10]  come about?
[2182.10 --> 2182.56]  Well,
[2182.60 --> 2183.34]  we have to ask
[2183.34 --> 2184.36]  ourselves a question
[2184.36 --> 2185.48]  and the question
[2185.48 --> 2186.00]  is,
[2186.42 --> 2187.56]  do you see yourself
[2187.56 --> 2188.26]  as a priest?
[2190.04 --> 2191.02]  Maybe you
[2191.02 --> 2191.82]  haven't before,
[2192.88 --> 2193.90]  but do you
[2193.90 --> 2194.92]  see yourself
[2194.92 --> 2196.92]  as a priest?
[2197.64 --> 2198.42]  Do you see
[2198.42 --> 2199.44]  yourself as someone
[2199.44 --> 2200.68]  who is called
[2200.68 --> 2202.58]  to help others
[2202.58 --> 2203.58]  draw near to God?
[2204.62 --> 2205.60]  Do you see
[2205.60 --> 2206.42]  yourself as someone
[2206.42 --> 2207.50]  who is called
[2207.50 --> 2208.70]  to come alongside
[2208.70 --> 2210.54]  and serve
[2210.54 --> 2211.38]  one another?
[2212.32 --> 2213.04]  Are you
[2213.04 --> 2214.24]  praying
[2214.24 --> 2215.72]  and interceding
[2215.72 --> 2216.98]  for each other
[2216.98 --> 2217.68]  in the church?
[2217.68 --> 2219.28]  or
[2219.28 --> 2221.08]  are we
[2221.08 --> 2222.40]  pointing fingers
[2222.40 --> 2223.60]  and criticizing
[2223.60 --> 2224.54]  and fighting?
[2226.34 --> 2227.16]  But not only
[2227.16 --> 2227.38]  that,
[2227.42 --> 2227.80]  when you think
[2227.80 --> 2229.22]  about the other
[2229.22 --> 2229.98]  brothers and sisters
[2229.98 --> 2230.46]  in the church
[2230.46 --> 2231.02]  community,
[2231.50 --> 2232.82]  not only do you
[2232.82 --> 2233.46]  see yourself
[2233.46 --> 2234.02]  as a priest,
[2234.12 --> 2234.60]  do you see
[2234.60 --> 2236.04]  them as a priest?
[2236.42 --> 2236.92]  Not like,
[2237.04 --> 2237.12]  well,
[2237.16 --> 2237.66]  I'm a priest
[2237.66 --> 2238.10]  and I have to
[2238.10 --> 2238.54]  serve them,
[2238.66 --> 2239.80]  but they are a priest
[2239.80 --> 2240.44]  and they have been
[2240.44 --> 2240.90]  called by God
[2240.90 --> 2241.46]  to serve me.
[2242.78 --> 2243.50]  That's different.
[2244.04 --> 2244.96]  That's more humbling
[2244.96 --> 2246.44]  to admit that
[2246.44 --> 2248.26]  they have something
[2248.26 --> 2249.58]  that you don't have
[2249.58 --> 2250.72]  that you need
[2250.72 --> 2251.86]  that God has
[2251.86 --> 2252.48]  called them
[2252.48 --> 2253.42]  to serve you with.
[2254.78 --> 2255.10]  Right?
[2255.14 --> 2255.94]  It's easy to look down
[2255.94 --> 2256.60]  on other people
[2256.60 --> 2257.50]  who differ from you
[2257.50 --> 2259.22]  and to dismiss them,
[2259.28 --> 2260.26]  to roll your eyes
[2260.26 --> 2260.72]  when they have
[2260.72 --> 2261.42]  different takes
[2261.42 --> 2262.54]  on certain things.
[2262.68 --> 2263.64]  But every single
[2263.64 --> 2264.92]  Christian in Jesus Christ
[2264.92 --> 2265.56]  in the church
[2265.56 --> 2266.34]  is anointed.
[2266.68 --> 2267.42]  We all have
[2267.42 --> 2268.34]  the Spirit of God.
[2269.14 --> 2270.80]  We are all set apart
[2270.80 --> 2271.76]  for God
[2271.76 --> 2274.00]  to serve him
[2274.00 --> 2274.62]  and to live
[2274.62 --> 2275.46]  for him
[2275.46 --> 2277.92]  and what that is
[2277.92 --> 2278.70]  that we are called
[2278.70 --> 2279.74]  to do to serve him
[2279.74 --> 2281.02]  is to serve one another.
[2281.88 --> 2282.80]  We are priests
[2282.80 --> 2283.42]  to one another.
[2283.70 --> 2284.40]  And so that should
[2284.40 --> 2285.18]  change the way
[2285.18 --> 2285.94]  we engage
[2285.94 --> 2287.12]  with one another,
[2287.30 --> 2288.08]  change the way
[2288.08 --> 2289.74]  we view each other
[2289.74 --> 2290.82]  and the way
[2290.82 --> 2292.38]  that we should then
[2292.38 --> 2293.34]  maybe listen
[2293.34 --> 2294.10]  to one another,
[2294.38 --> 2295.92]  receive from one another
[2295.92 --> 2297.12]  and learn humbly.
[2299.52 --> 2300.04]  And so let me,
[2300.24 --> 2300.74]  let's just do
[2300.74 --> 2301.64]  a thought experiment
[2301.64 --> 2302.22]  together.
[2304.16 --> 2306.48]  Who comes to mind
[2306.48 --> 2308.04]  when you think
[2308.04 --> 2310.24]  about tension
[2310.24 --> 2312.04]  in the church
[2312.04 --> 2316.06]  or wanting to
[2316.06 --> 2317.80]  maybe distance yourself
[2317.80 --> 2318.46]  a little bit
[2318.46 --> 2319.18]  from someone
[2319.18 --> 2320.08]  in the church family,
[2321.02 --> 2321.24]  right?
[2321.30 --> 2322.30]  Whoever that person is
[2322.30 --> 2323.64]  or whoever those people are,
[2324.64 --> 2327.44]  can I ask for myself
[2327.44 --> 2328.42]  and for all of us
[2328.42 --> 2329.88]  to look at them
[2329.88 --> 2331.48]  through this lens
[2331.48 --> 2332.80]  of Psalm 133
[2332.80 --> 2333.38]  and to ask,
[2333.74 --> 2334.80]  am I being a priest
[2334.80 --> 2335.16]  to them?
[2336.28 --> 2336.74]  Right?
[2336.76 --> 2337.74]  We all have our own
[2337.74 --> 2339.98]  opinions,
[2340.28 --> 2341.34]  our own preferences,
[2342.34 --> 2343.12]  you know,
[2343.16 --> 2343.96]  and it's so easy
[2343.96 --> 2345.34]  in our day
[2345.34 --> 2346.54]  when there's,
[2346.54 --> 2346.80]  you know,
[2346.86 --> 2346.98]  what,
[2347.04 --> 2347.68]  a dozen churches
[2347.68 --> 2348.34]  just in Ladner
[2348.34 --> 2349.34]  and hundreds
[2349.34 --> 2350.98]  to just go
[2350.98 --> 2351.74]  wherever
[2351.74 --> 2353.32]  it will exactly
[2353.32 --> 2354.12]  match your preferences.
[2354.28 --> 2354.94]  That's not unity.
[2355.64 --> 2356.56]  That's uniformity.
[2357.00 --> 2357.72]  It's not the same.
[2359.30 --> 2359.80]  But
[2359.80 --> 2362.08]  in a church
[2362.08 --> 2362.74]  that is
[2362.74 --> 2364.14]  a diverse group
[2364.14 --> 2364.68]  of people
[2364.68 --> 2366.14]  who are committed
[2366.14 --> 2367.34]  to living
[2367.34 --> 2368.14]  the Christian life
[2368.14 --> 2368.58]  together,
[2368.74 --> 2369.24]  even though
[2369.24 --> 2369.84]  we're different
[2369.84 --> 2370.38]  and we have
[2370.38 --> 2371.08]  different opinions,
[2371.72 --> 2373.16]  we have to then
[2373.16 --> 2373.56]  ask,
[2373.56 --> 2373.82]  well,
[2374.72 --> 2376.58]  how can I look out
[2376.58 --> 2377.68]  for someone else's
[2377.68 --> 2378.28]  well-being?
[2379.48 --> 2379.64]  Right?
[2379.74 --> 2380.92]  And shepherd them
[2380.92 --> 2381.54]  toward God
[2381.54 --> 2382.30]  and serve them
[2382.30 --> 2383.48]  even at expense
[2383.48 --> 2384.28]  to myself.
[2387.82 --> 2388.84]  And also
[2388.84 --> 2389.78]  to see,
[2389.90 --> 2389.98]  you know,
[2390.00 --> 2390.80]  as you think about
[2390.80 --> 2391.82]  the people,
[2391.92 --> 2392.42]  the person
[2392.42 --> 2393.16]  that you
[2393.16 --> 2394.16]  maybe kind of
[2394.16 --> 2395.70]  want to distance from,
[2396.66 --> 2398.54]  to also see
[2398.54 --> 2398.98]  that they have
[2398.98 --> 2399.98]  something that you need.
[2400.82 --> 2401.08]  Right?
[2401.42 --> 2402.36]  So let's pursue
[2402.36 --> 2402.94]  that together.
[2403.44 --> 2404.10]  That's how we
[2404.10 --> 2405.02]  experience unity,
[2405.12 --> 2405.28]  right?
[2405.32 --> 2405.88]  Is by serving
[2405.88 --> 2406.40]  one another.
[2407.42 --> 2407.86]  And so that's
[2407.86 --> 2408.54]  the first image
[2408.54 --> 2410.22]  that David gives.
[2410.40 --> 2411.14]  And the second one
[2411.14 --> 2411.82]  he gives is that
[2411.82 --> 2412.26]  of dew.
[2412.82 --> 2413.02]  Okay,
[2413.06 --> 2413.38]  water,
[2413.60 --> 2413.92]  essentially.
[2414.68 --> 2415.54]  So David goes on
[2415.54 --> 2416.10]  in verse 3
[2416.10 --> 2416.54]  and he says,
[2416.68 --> 2417.28]  when God's people
[2417.28 --> 2417.78]  live together
[2417.78 --> 2418.28]  in unity,
[2418.46 --> 2418.98]  he says,
[2419.54 --> 2420.22]  it's as if
[2420.22 --> 2421.52]  the dew of Hermon
[2421.52 --> 2422.70]  were falling
[2422.70 --> 2423.90]  on Mount Zion.
[2425.54 --> 2425.94]  Right?
[2427.00 --> 2427.42]  Okay,
[2427.50 --> 2428.16]  so what does that mean?
[2428.84 --> 2429.40]  I'm going to show you
[2429.40 --> 2429.74]  a photo.
[2429.90 --> 2430.32]  I didn't know
[2430.32 --> 2430.74]  what that means,
[2430.84 --> 2431.80]  so let me show you
[2431.80 --> 2432.16]  what I,
[2432.36 --> 2433.14]  I found
[2433.14 --> 2433.76]  on the internet.
[2434.58 --> 2435.66]  This is Mount Hermon.
[2436.56 --> 2437.70]  So Mount Hermon
[2437.70 --> 2438.92]  is on the border
[2438.92 --> 2439.54]  of Syria
[2439.54 --> 2440.54]  and Lebanon.
[2440.84 --> 2441.16]  It's over
[2441.16 --> 2443.52]  2,800 meters high.
[2443.86 --> 2444.62]  It's a pretty big mountain.
[2444.94 --> 2445.24]  It's taller
[2445.24 --> 2445.96]  than our North Shore
[2445.96 --> 2446.40]  mountains.
[2447.32 --> 2448.20]  And it talks
[2448.20 --> 2449.14]  about how dew
[2449.14 --> 2450.52]  falls on the mountain
[2450.52 --> 2451.28]  and it comes
[2451.28 --> 2452.02]  to find out
[2452.02 --> 2453.28]  it snows.
[2453.70 --> 2454.22]  There's actually
[2454.22 --> 2455.02]  a ski resort there.
[2455.22 --> 2455.84]  I want to go skiing
[2455.84 --> 2456.20]  in Israel.
[2456.42 --> 2456.76]  I didn't know
[2456.76 --> 2457.24]  you could do that.
[2457.90 --> 2458.42]  That would be cool.
[2459.02 --> 2459.96]  So that's Mount Hermon,
[2460.10 --> 2460.28]  right?
[2460.28 --> 2461.66]  It's high
[2461.66 --> 2462.44]  and because of that
[2462.44 --> 2463.08]  there's dew,
[2463.28 --> 2464.08]  there's water
[2464.08 --> 2465.66]  and in the summer
[2465.66 --> 2466.62]  it's flourishing,
[2466.72 --> 2467.28]  it's green.
[2468.50 --> 2469.40]  Now Mount Zion
[2469.40 --> 2470.08]  which is where
[2470.08 --> 2470.84]  the city of Jerusalem
[2470.84 --> 2471.42]  is built
[2471.42 --> 2472.62]  is also a mountain
[2472.62 --> 2473.50]  but it's much shorter,
[2473.74 --> 2475.40]  765 meters high
[2475.40 --> 2476.78]  and it is known
[2476.78 --> 2477.72]  for being dry
[2477.72 --> 2478.58]  and arid.
[2479.12 --> 2479.24]  Right?
[2479.24 --> 2480.14]  It doesn't get
[2480.14 --> 2480.74]  the dew
[2480.74 --> 2481.44]  and rainfall
[2481.44 --> 2482.98]  that the big mountain
[2482.98 --> 2484.14]  north has,
[2484.26 --> 2484.92]  Mount Hermon.
[2485.66 --> 2486.00]  So,
[2486.44 --> 2487.24]  David says
[2487.24 --> 2488.56]  that this unity
[2488.56 --> 2489.42]  that is so good,
[2489.48 --> 2489.68]  he says,
[2489.84 --> 2490.24]  imagine
[2490.24 --> 2491.80]  if the dew
[2491.80 --> 2492.90]  of Mount Hermon
[2492.90 --> 2495.10]  falls
[2495.10 --> 2495.98]  on
[2495.98 --> 2496.94]  Mount Zion,
[2497.66 --> 2497.98]  us.
[2499.06 --> 2499.84]  And this
[2499.84 --> 2500.56]  parched
[2500.56 --> 2501.36]  and arid
[2501.36 --> 2502.64]  ground
[2502.64 --> 2504.90]  that we experience
[2504.90 --> 2505.50]  in this unity
[2505.50 --> 2507.02]  comes alive
[2507.02 --> 2508.82]  with this life
[2508.82 --> 2510.32]  of unity
[2510.32 --> 2512.22]  that is flourishing.
[2512.86 --> 2513.18]  You know,
[2513.28 --> 2514.20]  you know how you go out
[2514.20 --> 2514.76]  in the mornings
[2514.76 --> 2515.72]  and it's really early
[2515.72 --> 2516.10]  and there's still
[2516.10 --> 2516.82]  that heavy dew
[2516.82 --> 2517.90]  on the ground
[2517.90 --> 2518.86]  and when you go out there
[2518.86 --> 2519.90]  and you take a deep breath
[2519.90 --> 2520.90]  and you can smell
[2520.90 --> 2522.46]  the morning,
[2522.66 --> 2523.34]  you can smell
[2523.34 --> 2525.62]  the kind of earthiness
[2525.62 --> 2527.78]  as you breathe in the air,
[2527.92 --> 2528.84]  the freshness
[2528.84 --> 2529.40]  of the morning.
[2530.80 --> 2532.22]  It's this life,
[2532.34 --> 2532.94]  this flourishing
[2532.94 --> 2533.70]  that we smell.
[2534.48 --> 2534.96]  And so what I think
[2534.96 --> 2536.12]  David is getting at here
[2536.12 --> 2537.24]  is that just as this dew
[2537.24 --> 2538.02]  brings fruitfulness
[2538.02 --> 2538.82]  on the earth,
[2538.98 --> 2540.44]  in the same way unity
[2540.44 --> 2541.50]  brings fruitfulness
[2541.50 --> 2542.30]  to God's people.
[2543.52 --> 2544.78]  That we flourish
[2544.78 --> 2545.34]  spiritually
[2545.34 --> 2546.44]  when we are
[2546.44 --> 2547.88]  in community
[2547.88 --> 2548.68]  together.
[2549.74 --> 2550.52]  So what does this
[2550.52 --> 2551.22]  mean for us?
[2552.00 --> 2552.78]  First of all,
[2552.86 --> 2553.14]  it means,
[2553.46 --> 2555.28]  I think we should say this,
[2555.46 --> 2556.50]  for you and for me
[2556.50 --> 2557.14]  individually,
[2557.98 --> 2559.18]  is your soul
[2559.18 --> 2560.30]  feeling parched
[2560.30 --> 2560.78]  and dry?
[2561.68 --> 2562.48]  I think we should
[2562.48 --> 2563.12]  pause
[2563.92 --> 2564.82]  and reflect
[2564.82 --> 2565.66]  on that question.
[2566.26 --> 2567.18]  Are you feeling
[2567.18 --> 2568.10]  parched and dry?
[2568.94 --> 2569.26]  Well,
[2569.30 --> 2570.02]  I want to encourage
[2570.02 --> 2570.58]  you first,
[2570.70 --> 2571.98]  just let the Spirit
[2571.98 --> 2572.50]  of God
[2572.50 --> 2573.80]  be like this dew
[2573.80 --> 2575.52]  and bring refreshment
[2575.52 --> 2576.20]  to your soul.
[2576.72 --> 2577.38]  If you're feeling
[2577.38 --> 2578.24]  parched and dry,
[2579.22 --> 2579.86]  we need to
[2579.86 --> 2580.78]  turn to God.
[2581.58 --> 2582.52]  Let the Holy Spirit
[2582.52 --> 2584.10]  fall on us
[2584.10 --> 2585.28]  and refresh us
[2585.28 --> 2586.20]  that comes from God.
[2587.28 --> 2588.34]  But that being said,
[2588.78 --> 2589.66]  not only that,
[2589.66 --> 2590.04]  as you look
[2590.04 --> 2590.98]  at other people,
[2592.02 --> 2592.62]  that unity
[2592.62 --> 2593.38]  that is good
[2593.38 --> 2593.76]  and pleasant
[2593.76 --> 2594.86]  comes from us
[2594.86 --> 2596.20]  seeing the needs
[2596.20 --> 2597.00]  for refreshing
[2597.00 --> 2597.74]  in others.
[2598.96 --> 2599.16]  Okay,
[2599.22 --> 2599.78]  we have to look
[2599.78 --> 2600.42]  at each other
[2600.42 --> 2602.60]  and see the need
[2602.60 --> 2603.98]  that we all have
[2603.98 --> 2605.82]  for God's
[2605.82 --> 2607.78]  redemption,
[2608.48 --> 2609.42]  his renewal,
[2610.58 --> 2611.18]  and not only
[2611.18 --> 2611.78]  in our lives,
[2611.82 --> 2612.26]  in the lives
[2612.26 --> 2612.84]  of other people
[2612.84 --> 2613.66]  in our church family,
[2614.00 --> 2614.86]  and then to realize
[2614.86 --> 2616.06]  that God is the one
[2616.06 --> 2616.82]  who is faithfully
[2616.82 --> 2617.50]  at work
[2617.50 --> 2618.28]  in the lives
[2618.28 --> 2619.38]  of other people
[2619.38 --> 2620.96]  to bring his renewal
[2620.96 --> 2621.66]  and his hope
[2621.66 --> 2624.06]  because he loves
[2624.06 --> 2624.62]  the church
[2624.62 --> 2625.94]  and he is building
[2625.94 --> 2626.78]  us up in Christ.
[2627.54 --> 2628.18]  And then lastly,
[2628.28 --> 2628.96]  this perspective
[2628.96 --> 2629.70]  is to remember
[2629.70 --> 2631.00]  that Jesus Christ
[2631.00 --> 2632.00]  who died
[2632.00 --> 2632.84]  and rose again
[2632.84 --> 2633.54]  and who ascended
[2633.54 --> 2634.04]  to heaven
[2634.04 --> 2635.84]  is one day
[2635.84 --> 2636.74]  going to return
[2636.74 --> 2637.80]  and when he returns
[2637.80 --> 2638.28]  it will be
[2638.28 --> 2640.28]  the ultimate renewal.
[2640.46 --> 2640.78]  It will be
[2640.78 --> 2642.04]  the ultimate time
[2642.04 --> 2642.80]  of refreshing
[2642.80 --> 2644.16]  and as followers
[2644.16 --> 2644.64]  of Jesus
[2644.64 --> 2645.56]  we live now
[2645.56 --> 2646.38]  in that hope.
[2646.38 --> 2648.44]  we live now
[2648.44 --> 2649.04]  with this hope
[2649.04 --> 2650.18]  that God
[2650.18 --> 2651.98]  will ultimately
[2651.98 --> 2654.50]  bring this
[2654.50 --> 2655.20]  spiritual renewal
[2655.20 --> 2656.10]  that we all need
[2656.10 --> 2658.40]  and that helps us
[2658.40 --> 2659.36]  especially when it
[2659.36 --> 2660.10]  seems hard
[2660.10 --> 2660.76]  and stressful
[2660.76 --> 2662.22]  to live in unity
[2662.22 --> 2662.72]  together.
[2663.20 --> 2663.86]  When we look
[2663.86 --> 2664.54]  at other people
[2664.54 --> 2665.26]  what it means is
[2665.26 --> 2666.26]  that we don't dismiss
[2666.26 --> 2668.18]  them because of
[2668.18 --> 2668.68]  their need
[2668.68 --> 2669.36]  but we know
[2669.36 --> 2670.60]  that God is at work
[2670.60 --> 2672.28]  and that he can
[2672.28 --> 2673.18]  work in that person
[2673.18 --> 2674.76]  just like we need
[2674.76 --> 2675.66]  him to work in us
[2675.66 --> 2676.94]  and we have hope
[2676.94 --> 2678.12]  and that means
[2678.12 --> 2679.00]  we can experience
[2679.00 --> 2679.82]  unity together.
[2680.76 --> 2681.18]  Okay so those
[2681.18 --> 2681.90]  are the two images
[2681.90 --> 2683.42]  that David gives us here.
[2683.80 --> 2684.60]  How good and pleasant
[2684.60 --> 2685.82]  it is when the family
[2685.82 --> 2687.02]  of God dwells in unity
[2687.02 --> 2688.14]  and he says
[2688.14 --> 2689.66]  it's like oil
[2689.66 --> 2691.10]  makes us priests
[2691.10 --> 2691.58]  for one another
[2691.58 --> 2692.14]  it's like this
[2692.14 --> 2693.14]  dew that falls
[2693.14 --> 2694.32]  and brings flourishing
[2694.32 --> 2694.76]  and renewal
[2694.76 --> 2695.56]  to one another
[2695.56 --> 2697.48]  and that's what it looks like
[2697.48 --> 2698.78]  and that's how we pursue it.
[2699.80 --> 2700.76]  So that brings us
[2700.76 --> 2701.74]  to our final point today
[2701.74 --> 2704.20]  that unity is divine.
[2704.20 --> 2706.98]  How do we get this unity?
[2707.98 --> 2709.34]  At the end of verse 3
[2709.34 --> 2710.14]  it says
[2710.14 --> 2712.34]  for there is
[2712.34 --> 2714.60]  for there
[2714.60 --> 2715.70]  on Mount Zion
[2715.70 --> 2716.56]  the Lord
[2716.56 --> 2717.76]  bestows his blessing
[2717.76 --> 2719.74]  even life forevermore.
[2720.90 --> 2721.98]  And what David is saying here
[2721.98 --> 2722.78]  is that this unity
[2722.78 --> 2723.60]  that is beautiful
[2723.60 --> 2724.62]  that is pleasant
[2724.62 --> 2725.28]  that is good
[2725.28 --> 2727.08]  it comes from God.
[2727.94 --> 2728.46]  Right?
[2728.76 --> 2730.02]  It's something that God
[2730.02 --> 2731.38]  blesses us with.
[2731.48 --> 2732.10]  Friends, God
[2732.10 --> 2733.66]  blesses us with unity.
[2733.66 --> 2734.52]  That's who God is.
[2734.62 --> 2735.36]  That's what he does.
[2736.22 --> 2737.46]  And one of the other things
[2737.46 --> 2738.76]  to take note in this psalm
[2738.76 --> 2740.32]  is not only here
[2740.32 --> 2740.82]  where it says
[2740.82 --> 2741.72]  the Lord blesses
[2741.72 --> 2742.90]  bestows blessing
[2742.90 --> 2744.66]  but this image
[2744.66 --> 2745.68]  in these other verses
[2745.68 --> 2747.08]  three times
[2747.08 --> 2748.54]  it uses the same Hebrew word
[2748.54 --> 2749.76]  for something coming down.
[2749.88 --> 2750.56]  Did you notice that?
[2751.08 --> 2752.60]  Oil coming down on the head
[2752.60 --> 2754.38]  down onto his robes
[2754.38 --> 2754.86]  the dew
[2754.86 --> 2755.72]  falling down
[2755.72 --> 2756.56]  onto Mount Zion.
[2758.30 --> 2759.18]  And the message
[2759.18 --> 2760.14]  we're meant to get here
[2760.14 --> 2760.72]  is that unity
[2760.72 --> 2762.18]  comes from God.
[2762.92 --> 2763.48]  It's something
[2763.48 --> 2764.44]  that we pursue
[2764.44 --> 2765.66]  as we are on this
[2765.66 --> 2766.76]  ascent
[2766.76 --> 2768.24]  to God
[2768.24 --> 2769.32]  that we're all in together
[2769.32 --> 2770.14]  something that we need
[2770.14 --> 2770.68]  to pursue
[2770.68 --> 2771.68]  but ultimately
[2771.68 --> 2773.86]  there's this downward movement
[2773.86 --> 2775.58]  of God coming to us.
[2776.28 --> 2777.10]  I love what
[2777.10 --> 2777.84]  the commentator
[2777.84 --> 2778.42]  Derek Kidner
[2778.42 --> 2779.04]  says here.
[2779.46 --> 2779.82]  He says
[2779.82 --> 2780.68]  true unity
[2780.68 --> 2781.94]  like all good gifts
[2781.94 --> 2783.18]  is from above
[2783.18 --> 2784.58]  bestowed
[2784.58 --> 2786.24]  rather than contrived
[2786.24 --> 2787.48]  a blessing
[2787.48 --> 2788.78]  far more
[2788.78 --> 2789.38]  than
[2789.38 --> 2790.46]  an achievement.
[2792.40 --> 2793.26]  And this is what
[2793.26 --> 2794.44]  the Bible says
[2794.44 --> 2795.74]  Jesus accomplished
[2795.74 --> 2797.30]  for us
[2797.30 --> 2798.20]  in his
[2798.20 --> 2798.90]  death
[2798.90 --> 2799.92]  and his resurrection.
[2801.42 --> 2801.66]  And so
[2801.66 --> 2802.54]  in talking about
[2802.54 --> 2803.90]  the early church
[2803.90 --> 2805.16]  the racial
[2805.16 --> 2805.96]  the cultural
[2805.96 --> 2806.58]  division
[2806.58 --> 2807.18]  between
[2807.18 --> 2807.86]  Jews
[2807.86 --> 2808.96]  and Gentiles
[2808.96 --> 2809.82]  in the church.
[2810.42 --> 2811.68]  Paul writes this
[2811.68 --> 2813.72]  put it up there
[2813.72 --> 2814.58]  from Ephesians
[2814.58 --> 2816.80]  Jesus himself
[2816.80 --> 2818.94]  is our peace
[2818.94 --> 2820.32]  who has made
[2820.32 --> 2821.26]  the two groups
[2821.26 --> 2822.18]  Jew and Gentile
[2822.18 --> 2822.70]  one
[2822.70 --> 2824.10]  and has destroyed
[2824.10 --> 2824.84]  the barrier
[2824.84 --> 2826.02]  the dividing wall
[2826.02 --> 2827.26]  of hostility
[2827.26 --> 2829.12]  so then
[2829.12 --> 2830.06]  you are no longer
[2830.06 --> 2831.00]  foreigners and strangers
[2831.00 --> 2832.16]  but fellow citizens
[2832.16 --> 2833.22]  with God's people
[2833.22 --> 2833.98]  and members
[2833.98 --> 2834.74]  of his household.
[2835.28 --> 2835.72]  He's talking about
[2835.72 --> 2836.50]  the church family.
[2838.12 --> 2838.76]  Jesus Christ
[2838.76 --> 2839.68]  in his death
[2839.68 --> 2840.36]  on the cross
[2840.36 --> 2841.62]  tore down
[2841.62 --> 2842.44]  the barrier
[2842.44 --> 2844.00]  that separates us
[2844.00 --> 2844.74]  from God
[2844.74 --> 2845.82]  and he tore down
[2845.82 --> 2846.34]  the barrier
[2846.34 --> 2847.34]  that we erect
[2847.34 --> 2848.10]  that keep us
[2848.10 --> 2849.12]  separated from other people.
[2849.36 --> 2850.26]  He tore it down.
[2851.30 --> 2851.76]  So now
[2851.76 --> 2853.60]  he has united us
[2853.60 --> 2854.70]  to himself
[2854.70 --> 2855.72]  through the cross
[2855.72 --> 2857.18]  and not only that
[2857.18 --> 2859.14]  it's not an individual thing
[2859.14 --> 2860.44]  he has united us
[2860.44 --> 2861.36]  to one another
[2861.36 --> 2862.30]  as his body.
[2862.86 --> 2863.64]  He has created
[2863.64 --> 2864.74]  a new family
[2864.74 --> 2867.08]  of every Christian
[2867.08 --> 2867.94]  that he has called
[2867.94 --> 2868.52]  to himself
[2868.52 --> 2871.36]  and in doing so
[2871.36 --> 2872.80]  he created
[2872.80 --> 2873.60]  a new community
[2873.60 --> 2874.30]  called the church
[2874.30 --> 2874.52]  right?
[2874.60 --> 2875.36]  One that is not built
[2875.36 --> 2876.32]  on any race
[2876.32 --> 2878.24]  not on any class
[2878.24 --> 2879.36]  not on any status
[2879.36 --> 2880.44]  not on money
[2880.44 --> 2881.40]  not on morality
[2881.40 --> 2882.62]  but that is built
[2882.62 --> 2883.44]  on grace alone
[2883.44 --> 2885.42]  where we are all
[2885.42 --> 2886.86]  equally separated
[2886.86 --> 2887.84]  from him
[2887.84 --> 2889.32]  because of our sin
[2889.32 --> 2890.52]  but we are all
[2890.52 --> 2891.72]  profoundly welcomed
[2891.72 --> 2893.68]  into his family
[2893.68 --> 2894.50]  by grace alone.
[2895.66 --> 2896.28]  And so what we see
[2896.28 --> 2896.64]  here friends
[2896.64 --> 2897.52]  is that it's God
[2897.52 --> 2898.26]  who comes down.
[2898.58 --> 2899.34]  It's the Lord
[2899.34 --> 2900.50]  who brings about unity.
[2900.94 --> 2902.14]  It's Jesus
[2902.14 --> 2903.08]  who has done that
[2903.08 --> 2903.72]  for us.
[2904.66 --> 2905.62]  So that's the first
[2905.62 --> 2907.44]  and most important thing
[2907.44 --> 2908.86]  before unity
[2908.86 --> 2909.96]  is a human work
[2909.96 --> 2911.38]  it is a divine gift.
[2913.08 --> 2914.28]  That being said
[2914.28 --> 2916.82]  once we receive
[2916.82 --> 2917.66]  this gift
[2917.66 --> 2919.42]  unity becomes
[2919.42 --> 2920.12]  a responsibility.
[2920.12 --> 2921.94]  It becomes a responsibility
[2921.94 --> 2924.22]  that we receive it
[2924.22 --> 2925.50]  as a gift.
[2925.60 --> 2926.46]  We don't have to work for it
[2926.46 --> 2927.10]  it's ours
[2927.10 --> 2929.02]  but we sure do have to
[2929.02 --> 2929.72]  enjoy it.
[2930.18 --> 2931.30]  We sure do have to
[2931.30 --> 2932.46]  use it
[2932.46 --> 2933.52]  together.
[2934.60 --> 2935.48]  That's why Paul
[2935.48 --> 2936.16]  later says
[2936.16 --> 2936.80]  in Ephesians
[2936.80 --> 2938.22]  chapter 4
[2938.22 --> 2939.34]  make every effort
[2939.34 --> 2941.60]  to keep the unity
[2941.60 --> 2942.48]  of the spirit
[2942.48 --> 2943.52]  through the bond of peace.
[2945.18 --> 2945.42]  Okay.
[2945.84 --> 2947.10]  You have the unity
[2947.10 --> 2947.76]  of the spirit
[2947.76 --> 2949.22]  but you gotta make
[2949.22 --> 2950.10]  every effort
[2950.10 --> 2951.44]  to keep it.
[2952.58 --> 2953.36]  Not that you will
[2953.36 --> 2953.74]  lose it
[2953.74 --> 2954.16]  but to
[2954.16 --> 2956.04]  that you can realize it
[2956.04 --> 2956.92]  it'll be manifest
[2956.92 --> 2957.64]  among you.
[2959.50 --> 2960.04]  And so friends
[2960.04 --> 2960.48]  that means that
[2960.48 --> 2961.38]  it is the responsibility
[2961.38 --> 2962.44]  of every Christian
[2962.44 --> 2963.28]  to put that unity
[2963.28 --> 2964.24]  that Jesus has won
[2964.24 --> 2964.82]  for us
[2964.82 --> 2965.94]  into action
[2965.94 --> 2966.88]  in the community.
[2967.72 --> 2968.66]  So here's
[2968.66 --> 2970.06]  the question
[2970.06 --> 2970.86]  for us
[2970.86 --> 2971.52]  is that
[2971.52 --> 2972.52]  will we
[2972.52 --> 2974.46]  lay down
[2974.46 --> 2975.32]  our lives?
[2975.78 --> 2977.02]  Will we lay down
[2977.02 --> 2978.20]  our agenda?
[2978.80 --> 2980.02]  Will we lay down
[2980.02 --> 2981.40]  seeking our own
[2981.40 --> 2982.12]  way
[2982.12 --> 2984.24]  for others
[2984.24 --> 2985.36]  as Jesus
[2985.36 --> 2986.22]  did for us?
[2988.38 --> 2989.62]  So would you pray
[2989.62 --> 2991.22]  with me?
[2991.28 --> 2991.86]  We need to pray
[2991.86 --> 2993.86]  that the reality
[2993.86 --> 2994.82]  of this psalm
[2994.82 --> 2995.78]  that we receive
[2995.78 --> 2996.40]  by grace
[2996.40 --> 2997.02]  that is true
[2997.02 --> 2997.58]  because God
[2997.58 --> 2998.58]  bestows it to us
[2998.58 --> 2999.72]  that it would be
[2999.72 --> 3001.34]  experienced among us
[3001.34 --> 3001.86]  here
[3001.86 --> 3003.50]  at Land or CRC.
[3004.24 --> 3004.64]  Right?
[3004.64 --> 3005.18]  That we would
[3005.18 --> 3006.10]  see one another
[3006.10 --> 3006.88]  as priests
[3006.88 --> 3007.82]  as priests
[3007.82 --> 3008.64]  to one another.
[3009.38 --> 3010.34]  That this due
[3010.34 --> 3011.12]  this time of
[3011.12 --> 3011.98]  refreshing
[3011.98 --> 3013.28]  and spiritual renewal
[3013.28 --> 3013.86]  would come
[3013.86 --> 3014.80]  that comes from
[3014.80 --> 3015.34]  the Lord
[3015.34 --> 3017.34]  would be at work
[3017.34 --> 3017.76]  in us
[3017.76 --> 3018.46]  and through us
[3018.46 --> 3019.60]  and that we would
[3019.60 --> 3020.60]  also find hope
[3020.60 --> 3021.24]  knowing that
[3021.24 --> 3021.90]  it is
[3021.90 --> 3022.58]  the Lord
[3022.58 --> 3023.78]  who blesses us
[3023.78 --> 3024.34]  with unity
[3024.34 --> 3025.94]  and helps us
[3025.94 --> 3026.40]  to maintain
[3026.40 --> 3026.98]  the unity
[3026.98 --> 3027.46]  and the bond
[3027.46 --> 3027.94]  of peace.
[3028.78 --> 3028.90]  Okay?
[3028.92 --> 3029.26]  Let's pray
[3029.26 --> 3029.88]  for those things.
[3030.04 --> 3030.36]  Let's pray.
[3030.36 --> 3034.42]  Father,
[3034.52 --> 3035.34]  we don't have
[3035.34 --> 3036.42]  the ability
[3036.42 --> 3039.96]  to keep
[3039.96 --> 3040.50]  the unity
[3040.50 --> 3040.96]  and the bond
[3040.96 --> 3041.50]  of peace
[3041.50 --> 3042.62]  in our own strength
[3042.62 --> 3044.46]  but Lord,
[3044.56 --> 3046.10]  only as we look
[3046.10 --> 3048.40]  to Jesus
[3048.40 --> 3050.46]  who has purchased
[3050.46 --> 3051.16]  the church
[3051.16 --> 3051.88]  for himself
[3051.88 --> 3053.70]  who has made us
[3053.70 --> 3054.54]  brothers and sisters
[3054.54 --> 3056.30]  and who has given us
[3056.30 --> 3057.58]  the spirit of God
[3057.58 --> 3058.38]  within us
[3058.38 --> 3060.50]  as we surrender
[3060.50 --> 3061.04]  to that
[3061.04 --> 3061.70]  as we yield
[3061.70 --> 3062.68]  to the spirit's work
[3062.68 --> 3063.16]  in us
[3063.16 --> 3064.04]  and among us
[3064.04 --> 3065.42]  as we put away
[3065.42 --> 3066.42]  selfish ambition
[3066.42 --> 3068.54]  can we then
[3068.54 --> 3070.30]  serve one another
[3070.30 --> 3072.34]  and in serving
[3072.34 --> 3073.44]  and coming
[3073.44 --> 3074.38]  alongside Lord
[3074.38 --> 3075.02]  could we
[3075.02 --> 3076.62]  experience
[3076.62 --> 3077.34]  the unity
[3077.34 --> 3078.64]  that you have
[3078.64 --> 3079.52]  blessed us with.
[3080.62 --> 3081.30]  Lord,
[3081.38 --> 3082.64]  especially as we
[3082.64 --> 3084.24]  invite
[3084.24 --> 3085.06]  our
[3085.06 --> 3086.16]  new immigrant
[3086.16 --> 3086.66]  families
[3086.66 --> 3087.58]  into our church
[3087.58 --> 3089.74]  as we
[3089.74 --> 3091.20]  invite
[3091.20 --> 3092.30]  Chinese
[3092.30 --> 3092.72]  neighbors
[3092.72 --> 3094.00]  into our church
[3094.00 --> 3095.28]  where we're
[3095.28 --> 3095.80]  coming from
[3095.80 --> 3096.54]  different places
[3096.54 --> 3097.64]  different experiences
[3097.64 --> 3098.24]  of God
[3098.24 --> 3099.30]  and different
[3099.30 --> 3099.82]  cultures
[3099.82 --> 3100.60]  and opinions
[3100.60 --> 3100.98]  Lord,
[3101.50 --> 3103.14]  help us
[3103.14 --> 3103.72]  not to see
[3103.72 --> 3104.12]  that they'll
[3104.12 --> 3104.82]  have to conform
[3104.82 --> 3105.66]  to us
[3105.66 --> 3106.52]  but that we'd
[3106.52 --> 3107.42]  all be willing
[3107.42 --> 3108.44]  to yield
[3108.44 --> 3109.10]  to one another
[3109.10 --> 3110.58]  to celebrate
[3110.58 --> 3111.64]  our differences
[3111.64 --> 3112.70]  the gifts
[3112.70 --> 3113.36]  that we bring
[3113.36 --> 3114.74]  and to receive
[3114.74 --> 3115.70]  from one another.
[3115.70 --> 3117.12]  Lord,
[3117.20 --> 3117.64]  we pray
[3117.64 --> 3118.86]  all of these
[3118.86 --> 3119.26]  things
[3119.26 --> 3119.74]  in the name
[3119.74 --> 3120.16]  of Jesus.
[3120.92 --> 3121.16]  Amen.
[3124.70 --> 3125.38]  So let's sing
[3125.38 --> 3126.30]  our song of response
[3126.30 --> 3127.82]  and let's all
[3127.82 --> 3128.72]  stand and sing
[3128.72 --> 3129.02]  together.
[3129.02 --> 3130.02]  Father.
[3159.02 --> 3161.02]  Father.
[3189.02 --> 3195.02]  He is the Lord our God.
[3195.02 --> 3201.02]  We are not consumed by the flood.
[3201.02 --> 3210.02]  Our power will protect the devil and all.
[3210.02 --> 3216.02]  We will flee in the house of Sodom.
[3216.02 --> 3222.02]  We will save with the hearts restored.
[3222.02 --> 3225.02]  He has done with things.
[3225.02 --> 3228.02]  We will stay together.
[3228.02 --> 3236.02]  We will feast and weep no more.
[3238.02 --> 3245.02]  In the dark of night, before the dawn,
[3245.02 --> 3257.02]  My soul be hearted free for the promised morning of God.
[3257.02 --> 3266.02]  O God of Jacob be my strength.
[3266.02 --> 3271.02]  We will feast in the house of Sodom.
[3271.02 --> 3277.02]  We will save with the hearts restored.
[3277.02 --> 3280.02]  He has done great things.
[3280.02 --> 3283.02]  We will stay together.
[3283.02 --> 3289.02]  We will feast and weep no more.
[3289.02 --> 3301.02]  Every vow we've broken and betrayed.
[3301.02 --> 3306.02]  You are the faithful one.
[3306.02 --> 3312.02]  And from the garden to the grave.
[3312.02 --> 3315.02]  And from the garden to the grave.
[3315.02 --> 3321.02]  We will feast and weep no more.
[3321.02 --> 3323.02]  God of Jacob be my strength.
[3323.02 --> 3325.02]  And from the garden to the mountains.
[3325.02 --> 3346.02]  We will sing with our hearts restored. He has done great things, we will stand together. We will praise and weep no more.
[3355.02 --> 3382.02]  It's time for our community prayer. And I would like to ask you that as we pray, that every time I end the section with the words,
[3382.02 --> 3389.02]  Lord in your mercy, you will respond with, hear our prayer.
[3389.02 --> 3400.02]  And before we enter in prayer, I need to share with you that the sister of Stephen Zhu, who is Pastor Nancy's husband, passed away in China.
[3400.02 --> 3411.02]  And that Stephen's friend has also passed away. So clearly there's sorrow and difficulty in that family and we will remember them here.
[3411.02 --> 3416.02]  So let us bow our heads and come to the Lord.
[3416.02 --> 3424.02]  O Lord, our Heavenly Father, we come before you this October morning with thankful hearts.
[3424.02 --> 3443.02]  All around us the harvesters come in, the fields lie prepared for winter. Season follows season, each with its own peculiar beauty and newness, all created by your hands and all a sign of your steadfast love and provision.
[3443.02 --> 3462.02]  So much more. You have redeemed us. You restored us by your Holy Spirit. You called us to be your children. All praise to you. Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3462.02 --> 3481.02]  We thank you, Lord, for our church community. Help us to live as your children, to encourage each other, to be patient and kind to all we meet, to live in such a manner that all who may see your love.
[3481.02 --> 3492.02]  But Lord, we are not without sorrow and troubles. So we pray for Stephen Zhu, that you will comfort him and his family in their loss.
[3492.02 --> 3500.02]  We pray also for leave and up, that the surgery will proceed, the schedule, and that it will go well.
[3500.02 --> 3529.02]  And behold up to you, our sisters and brothers, Pat, and Joan, and Cor, Andre, Carl, Grace, Mark, Hank, Shirley, Hoda, Diane, Gert, Jeanette, and John, and Henry, and Julie.
[3529.02 --> 3538.02]  Surround them with your loving presence. Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3538.02 --> 3547.02]  We pray for Pastor Jason, for Nancy, for Hannah, that you, Lord, will sustain and guide them.
[3547.02 --> 3554.02]  Be with our elders and deacons. Grant them wisdom and love as they go about their task.
[3554.02 --> 3562.02]  Lord, in this time of COVID, many ministries of our church are struggling to start up again or to adapt.
[3563.02 --> 3570.02]  Bless these efforts, we pray. Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3570.02 --> 3580.02]  Lord, we pray for your church worldwide. In many places it suffers persecution. Grant relief, we pray.
[3580.02 --> 3592.02]  Grant us above all unity of love and purpose, that we may speak with one voice and so be your witness to the world.
[3592.02 --> 3600.02]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3600.02 --> 3607.02]  And Lord, we pray for this world. There are wars and oppression, and sometimes it seems that evil triumphs.
[3607.02 --> 3615.02]  The COVID epidemic rages on uncontrolled in many places, causing sickness and death.
[3615.02 --> 3626.02]  Lord, you are the ruler of all the earth and all things are in your hands. Grant us justice. Grant us peace. Grant us relief.
[3626.02 --> 3636.02]  We pray for our country. Be with our prime minister, our premier, our mayor, all involved in the rule of this country.
[3636.02 --> 3643.02]  Grant them wisdom from you and a desire to seek justice and well-being for all.
[3643.02 --> 3649.02]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3649.02 --> 3661.02]  And so, Lord, we confess again that all things are in your fatherly hand. Lead us then and supply us in all our needs.
[3661.02 --> 3671.02]  These things we ask in the name of Jesus. Lord, hear our prayer. Amen.
[3679.02 --> 3691.02]  So, would you please rise?
[3691.02 --> 3700.02]  So, I want to ask you to do two things, kind of as application to this idea of pursuing unity together.
[3700.02 --> 3704.02]  One is right after the benediction, after we sing our song, we go out.
[3704.02 --> 3709.02]  Find someone you don't know as well.
[3709.02 --> 3711.02]  Maybe someone you don't normally talk to.
[3711.02 --> 3714.02]  And greet them and maybe have a conversation with them.
[3714.02 --> 3720.02]  The second thing is, next Sunday is our church family Sunday.
[3720.02 --> 3725.02]  When we try to really experience being one body together, that's a great time to come.
[3725.02 --> 3726.02]  Right?
[3726.02 --> 3733.02]  If many of us would kind of prioritize the church family Sunday as a Sunday when we are going to be here.
[3733.02 --> 3738.02]  I would, I think that would be really wonderful and be a blessing for all of us.
[3738.02 --> 3745.02]  So, I invite you now to hold out your hands, receive the blessing that comes down like dew, falling on Mount Zion.
[3745.02 --> 3750.02]  I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[3750.02 --> 3753.02]  Be completely humble and gentle.
[3753.02 --> 3757.02]  Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
[3757.02 --> 3761.02]  Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace.
[3761.02 --> 3773.02]  For there is one body and one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
[3773.02 --> 3774.02]  Amen.
[3774.02 --> 3787.02]  Lord of lords, sing our praise.
[3787.02 --> 3797.02]  Lord of lords, sing our praise.
[3797.02 --> 3802.02]  You alone are worthy.
[3802.02 --> 3812.02]  All the earth and heaven sing, praise us to your name.
[3812.02 --> 3822.02]  Lamb of God, holy one, precious and forgiving.
[3822.02 --> 3832.02]  Mourning star, rising star, there is none like you.
[3832.02 --> 3843.02]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, anyone.
[3843.02 --> 3854.02]  Praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[3854.02 --> 3869.02]  Praise the King of glory, praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[3884.02 --> 3905.02]  Lord of lords, sing our praise.
