• The church is described as a living temple of God, where the Spirit dwells
• Believers are declared a royal priesthood, with access to God without intermediaries
• Christianity was a new and different religion from others in the ancient world
• Christians were considered atheists by the Romans because they didn't have temples, priests, or sacrifices like other religions did
• Jesus is referred to as the temple, priest, and sacrifice for sin
• Through faith, believers become connected to Christ and therefore become the temple, priests, and sacrifices themselves
• Peter encourages early Christian readers to live for God as a sacrificial offering in their lives.

• Early Christian practices were often seen as strange and foreign compared to the surrounding culture
• Examples include avoiding gladiatorial games in Rome and not participating in the practice of killing infants.
• Christians in the early church accepted and empowered women, who were marginalized in their culture.
• They adhered to a strict sex ethic, reserving sex for marriage only.
• Christians were known for their generosity, especially when it came to sharing resources with the poor and enslaved people.
• They held Holy Communion, where people of all backgrounds drank from one cup, which was considered scandalous at the time.

• The church is a community that reflects God's love through its diverse and multicultural makeup
• Christians are called to be "resident aliens" in their culture, maintaining their values as a community built on Christ
• This requires living for the good of others and acknowledging God's glory through good deeds
• Being "pilgrims" means being priests and ambassadors for God, influencing those around us with our actions
• The foundation for this kind of life is built on Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the cornerstone
• Building lives on various foundations (power, approval, money, possessions, citizenship, ethnicity, gender, sexuality)
• One cornerstone is the foundation that orients identity in the world
• Jesus Christ is the only true cornerstone for a stable and proper life
• Building on other foundations leads to shame and disappointment
• Jesus took on human flesh and lived among people
• He didn't assimilate into the culture but instead maintained his unique identity
• His life was marked by rejection, including being misunderstood and vilified
• Despite this, he continued to live in love and redemption towards others
• As a priest and pilgrim, Jesus calls us to live differently and according to God's reality
