[266.00 → 272.36] Welcome to all who are joining us in our live stream service here at Ladder Christian
[272.36 → 274.24] Reformed Church.
[274.24 → 277.96] My name is John and I will be the worship leader for this service.
[277.96 → 282.76] Pastor Jason will be bringing us the word, and we will be celebrating communion this
[282.76 → 284.34] morning.
[284.34 → 288.94] Even though we are not physically together, we know that we will receive a blessing as
[288.94 → 292.10] a body of Christ.
[292.10 → 298.68] One announcement, just let you know that Kathy Scott's funeral will be this coming Tuesday
[298.68 → 303.56] at 10am at the Valley View Cemetery in Surrey.
[303.56 → 310.56] This is a private service, only family invited, but there will be a viewing at the Valley View
[310.56 → 315.76] as well 9am to 10am on the same day and that's Tuesday.
[315.76 → 320.82] So we will be remembering the Scott family in our prayer.
[320.82 → 327.24] The offering today is for Therefore Go Ministries, formerly Youth Unlimited.
[327.24 → 333.28] This is an organization that focuses on assisting local congregations in their ministry to youth
[333.28 → 335.42] and emerging adults.
[335.42 → 342.58] This ministry is passionate about assisting congregations across Canada and the U.S. in their youth ministry
[342.58 → 349.08] through short-term missions and training.
[349.08 → 355.92] Our call to worship this morning is based on Isaiah 43, 19-21.
[355.92 → 360.02] Let us worship God who has done great things.
[360.02 → 365.70] We rejoice in our God who made a way through the desert in this world.
[365.70 → 371.82] Let us worship God who has caused streams of mercy to flow in the wasteland.
[371.82 → 375.92] We are the people of God formed through Christ.
[375.92 → 379.68] We worship Him and we rejoice.
[379.68 → 383.16] Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[383.16 → 386.10] We praise God for the grace that has saved us.
[386.10 → 387.40] Hallelujah!
[387.40 → 390.06] We rejoice.
[390.06 → 394.36] Now God's greeting, which comes from Jude 1 verse 2.
[394.36 → 400.82] To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ.
[400.82 → 404.30] May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[404.30 → 408.04] Now this is usually the time for mutual greetings.
[408.04 → 415.50] But once again we ask if you could consider phoning or calling or contacting someone within our congregation
[415.50 → 422.84] this week just to connect with them and especially consider those that are alone, living alone or are shut in.
[430.82 → 454.30] Make known the power of His grace, the beauty of His peace.
[454.30 → 462.64] Remember how His mercy reached, and we cried out to Him.
[463.38 → 471.42] He lifted us to solemn ground, to freedom from our sin.
[471.42 → 486.70] O sing my soul and tell on His sound, till the earth and hands are filled with His glory.
[490.04 → 498.48] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[498.48 → 506.48] His power in us is greater than, is greater than this world.
[507.36 → 515.48] To share the reason for our hope, to serve with love and grace.
[516.54 → 524.92] That all who see Him shine through us, I pray the Father praise.
[524.92 → 539.74] O sing my soul and tell on His sound, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[539.74 → 551.62] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our light.
[551.62 → 559.62] No other name on earth can sing, can raise us to life.
[560.96 → 568.98] He opens up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown.
[569.88 → 577.92] We labour in His fields of praise as we lead sinners home.
[577.92 → 592.96] Oh sing my soul and tell on His sound, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[592.96 → 596.96] Sing my soul and tell on His glory.
[596.96 → 608.50] Sing my soul and tell on His sound, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[608.50 → 612.96] Sing my soul and tell on His glory.
[612.96 → 614.96] Sing my soul and tell on His glory.
[614.96 → 643.52] Jesus, all for Jesus
[644.96 → 650.58] All I have and have
[650.58 → 655.26] And ever hope to be
[655.26 → 666.64] All of my ambitions, hopes and plans
[666.64 → 671.66] I surrender these
[671.66 → 675.88] Into your hands
[675.88 → 681.66] For it's only in
[681.66 → 686.84] Your will that I am free
[686.84 → 691.06] For it's only in
[691.06 → 698.78] Your will that I am free
[698.78 → 708.06] Jesus, all for Jesus
[708.06 → 714.54] All I have and have
[714.54 → 718.06] And ever hope to be
[718.06 → 730.06] Jesus, all for Jesus
[730.06 → 735.54] All I have and have
[735.54 → 740.06] And ever hope to be
[740.06 → 752.06] All of my ambitions, hopes and plans
[752.06 → 756.28] I surrender these
[756.28 → 762.28] Into your hands
[762.28 → 768.28] For it's only in
[768.28 → 773.28] Your will that I am free
[773.28 → 777.50] For it's only in
[777.50 → 785.28] Your will that I am free
[785.28 → 794.28] Jesus, all for Jesus
[794.28 → 796.28] All I have and have
[796.28 → 804.28] And ever hope to be
[804.28 → 806.28] Jesus, all I am and have
[806.28 → 808.28] And ever hope to be
[808.28 → 810.28] Jesus, all I am and have
[810.28 → 812.28] And ever hope to be
[812.28 → 814.28] Jesus, all for Jesus
[814.28 → 816.66] Please join me in this prayer
[816.66 → 818.14] Of confession
[818.14 → 820.74] Please read the bold text
[820.74 → 824.08] Almighty and merciful God
[824.08 → 826.06] We confess that we have sinned
[826.06 → 827.98] Against you and one another
[827.98 → 829.54] In both our actions
[829.54 → 831.22] And our inactions
[831.22 → 835.14] We recognize that in Jesus Christ
[835.14 → 836.52] Our light has come
[836.52 → 838.60] Yet often we choose
[838.60 → 839.96] To walk in shadows
[839.96 → 841.40] And ignore the light
[841.40 → 844.60] Gracious God
[844.60 → 845.94] Forgive our sins
[845.94 → 847.22] And remove from us
[847.22 → 848.32] The veil of darkness
[848.32 → 850.52] That shrouds our lives
[850.52 → 852.96] Illumined by your word
[852.96 → 853.74] And sacrament
[853.74 → 855.16] May we rise
[855.16 → 857.56] To the radiance of Christ's glory
[857.56 → 858.42] Amen
[858.42 → 861.28] And our words of assurance
[861.28 → 862.40] This morning come from
[862.40 → 864.88] 1 John 1, verses 5-7
[864.88 → 867.00] This is the message
[867.00 → 868.30] We have heard from him
[868.30 → 869.82] And proclaim to you
[869.82 → 871.50] That God is light
[871.50 → 872.92] And in him there is
[872.92 → 874.28] No darkness at all
[874.28 → 876.46] If we say that we have
[876.46 → 877.66] Fellowship with him
[877.66 → 879.14] While we are walking
[879.14 → 879.86] In the darkness
[879.86 → 881.16] We lie
[881.16 → 882.56] And do not do
[882.56 → 883.34] What is true
[883.34 → 885.20] But if we walk
[885.20 → 885.80] In the light
[885.80 → 886.84] As he himself
[886.84 → 887.62] Is in the light
[887.62 → 889.02] We have fellowship
[889.02 → 889.94] With one another
[889.94 → 892.48] And the blood of Jesus Christ
[892.48 → 893.22] His son
[893.22 → 894.28] Cleanses us
[894.28 → 895.74] From all our sin
[895.74 → 918.62] Good shepherd of my soul
[918.62 → 922.32] Come dwell within me
[922.32 → 925.58] Take all I am
[925.58 → 927.00] And mould
[927.00 → 930.68] Your likeness in me
[930.68 → 935.18] Before the cross of Christ
[935.18 → 939.40] This is my sacrifice
[939.40 → 942.26] A life laid down
[942.26 → 945.12] And ready to follow
[945.12 → 952.08] The troubled find their peace
[952.08 → 954.80] In true surrender
[954.80 → 960.12] The prisoners they release
[960.12 → 963.36] From chains of anger
[963.36 → 968.46] In springs of living grace
[968.46 → 972.92] I find a resting place
[972.92 → 975.84] To rise refreshed
[975.84 → 978.14] Determined to follow
[978.14 → 985.76] I'll walk this narrow road
[985.76 → 989.34] With Christ before me
[989.34 → 991.80] Where thorns and thistles
[991.80 → 993.80] Where thorns and thistles grow
[993.80 → 997.84] And cords ensnare me
[997.84 → 1002.28] Though doubted and denied
[1002.28 → 1006.68] He never leaves my side
[1006.68 → 1009.90] But lifts my head
[1009.90 → 1012.50] And calls me to follow
[1012.50 → 1031.72] And when my days are gone
[1031.72 → 1034.82] My strength is failing
[1034.82 → 1040.00] He'll carry me along
[1040.00 → 1043.84] Through death's unveiling
[1043.84 → 1047.96] Earth's struggles overcome
[1047.96 → 1052.70] Heaven's journey just begun
[1052.70 → 1055.86] To search Christ's steps
[1055.86 → 1058.28] And ever to follow
[1058.28 → 1064.38] To search Christ's steps
[1064.38 → 1067.56] And ever to follow
[1067.56 → 1085.26] We're just waiting for Pastor Jason to come
[1085.26 → 1086.58] He's doing the communion
[1086.58 → 1089.08] with the Chinese church this morning
[1089.08 → 1092.40] So do you think we could sing another song
[1092.40 → 1093.00] while we're waiting
[1093.00 → 1095.46] or repeat one of the songs?
[1097.56 → 1106.32] The the the the
[1106.32 → 1109.04] the the
[1109.04 → 1111.00] who
[1111.00 → 1114.88] Who
[1114.88 → 1126.00] Do
[1126.00 → 1134.38] Good Shepherd of my soul, come dwell within me.
[1134.38 → 1142.38] Take all I am and mould your likeness in me.
[1142.78 → 1150.66] Before the cross of Christ, this is my sacrifice.
[1150.66 → 1155.46] A life laid down and ready to fall.
[1158.36 → 1165.62] The troubled find their peace in true surrender.
[1167.24 → 1173.72] The prisoners there release from chains of anger.
[1173.72 → 1182.70] In springs of living grace, I find a resting place.
[1183.02 → 1187.86] To rise refreshed, determined to follow.
[1191.14 → 1198.90] I'll walk this narrow road with Christ before me.
[1198.90 → 1206.94] Where thorns and thistles grow, and cords ensnare me.
[1207.68 → 1215.26] Though doubted and denied, He never leaves my side.
[1215.72 → 1220.26] But lifts my head and calls me to follow.
[1220.26 → 1241.68] And when my days are gone, my strength is failing.
[1241.68 → 1250.50] He'll carry me along, through death's unveiling.
[1251.46 → 1258.98] Where struggles to overcome, heaven's journey just begun.
[1258.98 → 1264.36] To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1267.76 → 1272.98] To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1288.98 → 1304.18] Let us join in prayer, offering our praise and thanksgiving and intercession to God.
[1305.76 → 1312.64] We praise you, God, our creator, for your handiwork in shaping and sustaining your wondrous creation.
[1312.64 → 1318.22] We especially thank you for the miracle of life and the wonder of living.
[1319.26 → 1321.84] Particular blessings come to us in this day.
[1322.66 → 1324.62] The resources of the earth.
[1325.78 → 1329.12] Gifts of creative vision and skilful craft.
[1329.90 → 1332.24] The treasure stored in every human life.
[1333.36 → 1335.84] We pray for others, God our Saviour.
[1336.84 → 1339.74] Claiming your love in Jesus Christ for the whole world.
[1339.74 → 1344.40] And committing ourselves to care for those around us in his name.
[1345.56 → 1349.14] We especially pray for those who work for the benefit of others.
[1349.48 → 1350.56] Our public servants.
[1351.44 → 1353.54] Firefighters, police and armed forces.
[1354.30 → 1356.90] Those in healthcare during this time of COVID.
[1357.98 → 1362.26] We pray for those who have lost loved ones due to COVID-19.
[1363.08 → 1364.48] Those who cannot work.
[1365.24 → 1366.44] Who have no work.
[1366.54 → 1368.68] Who have lost their jobs during this pandemic.
[1369.74 → 1372.20] Those who teach and those who learn.
[1373.40 → 1374.74] People who are poor.
[1375.44 → 1377.92] Even those in our community and country.
[1379.30 → 1381.18] The church in persecution.
[1382.54 → 1385.10] Particularly Christians in Nigeria.
[1385.82 → 1391.26] Where more Christians have died for their faith than any other country during 2020.
[1391.48 → 1394.44] The nations of the world.
[1394.44 → 1397.32] Especially our neighbour the U.S.
[1397.32 → 1398.66] We pray for healing.
[1398.66 → 1400.48] For this divided country.
[1401.38 → 1402.94] We pray for calm and peace.
[1403.74 → 1408.00] Especially these next few weeks leading up to the inauguration of a new president.
[1408.00 → 1411.60] For our nation and its leaders.

[1418.18 → 1420.88] Providing leadership during this time of pandemic.

[1421.88 → 1422.60] Give them wisdom.
[1422.60 → 1425.96] And may we as your people consider the greater good.
[1426.58 → 1428.26] In following the health guidelines.

[1499.50 → 1500.78] God our creator.
[1500.78 → 1502.94] Years in the morning.
[1502.94 → 1504.26] And years in the evening.
[1504.90 → 1505.84] Let Christ.
[1505.98 → 1506.98] The son of righteousness.
[1507.70 → 1508.40] Shine forever.
[1508.70 → 1509.70] In our hearts.
[1510.38 → 1512.00] And draw us to the light.
[1512.24 → 1513.30] Of your radiant glory.
[1514.08 → 1516.50] We ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ.
[1516.92 → 1517.76] Our redeemer.
[1518.26 → 1518.56] Amen.
[1518.56 → 1518.72] Amen.
[1518.72 → 1531.48] Good morning friends.
[1533.56 → 1538.96] And so we have together come through the season of Advent.
[1538.96 → 1544.56] When we considered the promise and the hope that Jesus the Messiah would come to us.
[1544.56 → 1546.18] And then in Christmas.
[1546.62 → 1550.16] When we celebrate the fact that Jesus has indeed come.
[1551.10 → 1555.66] And so now we are in the church season called Epiphany.
[1555.82 → 1558.34] And this might not be as familiar to some of us.
[1558.98 → 1563.54] But Epiphany is a word that means to manifest or to reveal.
[1563.54 → 1570.66] And so it's the season in which we consider the revelation of Jesus to the entire world.
[1571.14 → 1575.38] It's a time when we consider the life and the ministry of Jesus.
[1575.38 → 1577.02] All that he did and taught.
[1577.98 → 1580.18] And the way that we're going to do this together.
[1580.38 → 1582.74] The way we're going to consider the life of Jesus.
[1583.38 → 1586.92] Is through this sermon series on the seven I am sayings.
[1587.28 → 1589.12] Of Jesus in the Gospel of John.
[1589.12 → 1593.28] And this is where Jesus uses this metaphorical language.
[1593.28 → 1595.18] Where he says things like I am the door.
[1595.56 → 1597.00] I am the shepherd.
[1597.28 → 1598.46] I am the way.
[1599.42 → 1604.56] And all of this is describing to us who he is.
[1605.58 → 1608.22] And what it is he brings to our lives.
[1608.32 → 1610.00] And so on important thing to remember.
[1610.54 → 1615.06] Is that everything that God reveals about himself in the scripture.
[1615.06 → 1619.44] Is directly connected to his relationship with us.
[1620.18 → 1620.54] Right?
[1620.60 → 1623.46] There are many mysteries about God.
[1623.80 → 1625.76] That we do not understand.
[1626.38 → 1627.76] And that we would love to know.
[1628.42 → 1631.28] But what God has chosen to reveal.
[1631.94 → 1635.02] Directly corresponds to his concern.
[1635.46 → 1636.26] And his care.
[1636.38 → 1638.04] And his love for us.
[1639.30 → 1642.22] And so last week we looked at John chapter 8.
[1642.22 → 1644.78] Where Jesus said before Abraham was.
[1645.30 → 1646.30] I am.
[1646.70 → 1647.68] And in saying that.
[1647.76 → 1649.84] He was revealing his true name.
[1649.94 → 1651.46] His true identity in nature.
[1651.90 → 1654.24] And he was telling us that he is actually.
[1654.24 → 1656.76] The faithful covenant keeping God.
[1656.90 → 1659.52] Who has entered into the brokenness of this world.
[1659.66 → 1660.86] In order to save us.
[1661.90 → 1663.32] And today we're going to be looking.
[1664.16 → 1665.24] At where Jesus says.
[1666.38 → 1668.48] I am the bread of life.
[1668.48 → 1671.90] So we will read from John chapter 6.
[1672.04 → 1675.10] And we'll be looking at verses 25 to 35.
[1675.42 → 1677.92] And then 48 to 58.
[1678.12 → 1679.20] Kind of two sections there.
[1680.04 → 1682.26] We'll have it up on the screen in a second.
[1682.56 → 1683.80] But just for some context.
[1684.36 → 1686.88] So what happened just prior to this.
[1687.18 → 1689.92] Is that Jesus had fed a huge crowd of people.
[1690.04 → 1692.00] We call it the feeding of the 5,000.
[1692.00 → 1695.24] And after he had fed them.
[1695.56 → 1696.56] He left them.
[1697.02 → 1699.12] And he went to the other side of the lake.
[1699.22 → 1700.18] The Sea of Galilee.
[1700.80 → 1702.86] And the people there followed him.
[1702.92 → 1704.16] They followed him across the lake.
[1704.86 → 1707.14] And our passage picks up.
[1707.20 → 1709.06] At the moment when they go across.
[1709.14 → 1710.54] And they encounter Jesus again.
[1711.22 → 1711.42] Okay.
[1711.46 → 1714.60] So let's turn our attention to the reading of this passage.
[1714.70 → 1715.46] This is God's word.
[1715.46 → 1719.22] When they found him on the other side of the lake.
[1719.32 → 1719.98] They asked him.
[1720.58 → 1722.26] Rabbi when did you get here?
[1723.10 → 1723.84] Jesus answered.
[1724.54 → 1725.86] Very truly I tell you.
[1726.02 → 1727.08] You are looking for me.
[1727.34 → 1729.66] Not because you saw the signs I performed.
[1730.22 → 1732.04] But because you ate the loaves.
[1732.18 → 1733.00] And had your fill.
[1734.02 → 1735.88] Do not work for food that spoils.
[1736.04 → 1737.58] But for food that endures.
[1737.82 → 1739.04] To eternal life.
[1739.46 → 1741.34] Which the son of man will give you.
[1741.88 → 1742.84] For on him.
[1742.84 → 1744.76] God the father has placed.
[1744.76 → 1746.22] His seal of approval.
[1747.80 → 1749.02] Then they asked him.
[1749.56 → 1750.52] What must we do.
[1750.70 → 1752.54] To do the works God requires.
[1753.68 → 1754.60] Jesus answered.
[1755.24 → 1756.46] The work of God is this.
[1756.56 → 1757.94] To believe in the one.
[1758.16 → 1759.16] He has sent.
[1760.08 → 1760.92] So they asked him.
[1761.54 → 1763.30] Well what sign then will you give.
[1763.52 → 1764.78] That we may see it.
[1765.12 → 1765.96] And believe you.
[1766.54 → 1767.48] What will you do?
[1768.08 → 1770.16] Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness.
[1770.16 → 1771.20] As it is written.
[1771.60 → 1773.72] He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
[1774.70 → 1775.54] Jesus said to them.
[1775.66 → 1776.78] Very truly I tell you.
[1776.84 → 1778.70] It is not Moses who has given you.
[1778.84 → 1779.68] The bread from heaven.
[1780.10 → 1781.44] But it is my father.
[1781.44 → 1783.14] Who gives you the true bread.
[1783.26 → 1783.90] From heaven.
[1784.94 → 1786.02] For the bread of God.
[1786.18 → 1788.02] Is the bread that comes down from heaven.
[1788.16 → 1789.44] And gives life to the world.
[1790.56 → 1791.50] Sir they said.
[1792.18 → 1793.52] Always give us this bread.
[1794.58 → 1795.70] Then Jesus declared.
[1795.86 → 1797.24] I am the bread of life.
[1797.70 → 1798.74] Whoever comes to me.
[1798.74 → 1799.76] Will never go hungry.
[1799.76 → 1801.64] And whoever believes in me.
[1801.76 → 1803.28] Will never be thirsty.
[1805.04 → 1805.96] Verse 48.
[1806.14 → 1807.54] I am the bread of life.
[1808.16 → 1810.38] Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness.
[1810.62 → 1811.34] Yet they died.
[1811.46 → 1813.80] But here is the bread that comes down from heaven.
[1813.96 → 1816.36] Which anyone may eat and not die.
[1817.06 → 1820.14] I am the living bread that came down from heaven.
[1820.52 → 1821.80] Whoever eats this bread.
[1821.92 → 1823.26] Will live forever.
[1823.94 → 1825.78] This bread is my flesh.
[1826.36 → 1829.08] Which I give for the life of the world.
[1829.76 → 1836.80] Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves.
[1837.42 → 1839.60] How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
[1840.82 → 1841.92] Jesus said to them.
[1842.56 → 1843.96] Very truly I tell you.
[1844.10 → 1846.32] Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man.
[1846.42 → 1847.28] And drink his blood.
[1847.84 → 1849.34] You have no life in you.
[1850.16 → 1851.44] Whoever eats my flesh.
[1851.44 → 1852.66] And drinks my blood.
[1852.94 → 1854.06] Has eternal life.
[1854.52 → 1855.82] And I will raise them up.
[1855.94 → 1856.80] At the last day.
[1857.48 → 1859.10] For my flesh is real food.
[1859.10 → 1860.66] And my blood is real drink.
[1861.14 → 1862.36] Whoever eats my flesh.
[1862.46 → 1863.52] And drinks my blood.
[1864.00 → 1864.86] Remains in me.
[1864.96 → 1865.84] And I in them.
[1866.64 → 1868.46] Just as the living father sent me.
[1868.94 → 1870.54] And I live because of the father.
[1870.66 → 1871.98] So the one who feeds on me.
[1872.08 → 1873.18] Will live because of me.
[1873.96 → 1876.32] This is the bread that came down from heaven.
[1877.08 → 1879.70] Your ancestors ate manna and died.
[1879.70 → 1881.76] But whoever feeds on this bread.
[1882.10 → 1883.36] Will live forever.
[1884.72 → 1886.48] This is the word of the Lord.
[1886.74 → 1888.64] And it is absolutely true.
[1889.24 → 1891.20] And God gives it to us because he loves us.
[1891.52 → 1892.92] So let's come before him in prayer.
[1893.14 → 1897.88] As we enter into this time of reflecting on his word together.
[1899.64 → 1901.72] Heavenly Father we come before you.
[1902.86 → 1904.48] Hungry for so many things.
[1904.48 → 1908.76] We come to you searching for life.
[1909.40 → 1913.34] Because we know that you are the source of true life.
[1913.48 → 1917.64] And there is no other life in this world that we can eat of.
[1917.84 → 1919.58] And truly be satisfied.
[1920.22 → 1921.62] And so Lord as we come to you.
[1921.76 → 1923.56] And as we feast on your word.
[1923.68 → 1925.02] And at your table later on.
[1925.24 → 1926.68] Lord we pray that you would feed us.
[1927.22 → 1929.90] That your Holy Spirit would illumine to us.
[1929.90 → 1932.64] And reveal to us in this time of epiphany who you are.
[1933.08 → 1934.52] And what it means to follow you.
[1934.92 → 1936.00] We pray in Jesus name.
[1936.28 → 1936.58] Amen.
[1937.90 → 1943.28] So I want to begin this morning by inviting you to imagine with me for a minute.
[1943.50 → 1946.74] It's an experience that I think we are all familiar with.
[1947.50 → 1952.18] So imagine that you're going to have a meal.
[1952.58 → 1954.20] Maybe you get together with a group of friends.
[1954.28 → 1957.12] And you say, oh what kind of, what restaurant do we want to go to?
[1957.74 → 1959.24] And you throw out some ideas.
[1959.24 → 1961.08] And finally someone says the one restaurant.
[1961.22 → 1962.76] And everyone says, yes that's the one.
[1963.00 → 1963.80] We're all excited.
[1963.98 → 1964.54] So you go.
[1965.06 → 1966.34] You get there at the restaurant.
[1966.58 → 1967.76] And you're sitting at the table.
[1968.30 → 1969.88] The waiter brings you a menu.
[1970.58 → 1971.90] And you're looking at it.
[1971.96 → 1972.82] You're starving.
[1973.44 → 1974.58] But you're looking through.
[1974.72 → 1976.14] And you just don't know what you want to have.
[1976.26 → 1978.62] They have the fish and the burger.
[1978.80 → 1979.88] Which I always kind of go for.
[1980.44 → 1984.68] Or maybe a steak or whatever on the menu.
[1985.02 → 1985.92] And you're looking at it.
[1985.96 → 1986.46] You're hungry.
[1986.46 → 1991.18] You just don't know what it is that will really kind of satisfy your hunger.
[1992.12 → 1994.04] So then you see the waiter walk by.
[1994.28 → 1996.52] And she's carrying a plate.
[1996.64 → 1998.30] And she brings it to the table next over.
[1998.74 → 2002.62] And as the smell of the food kind of comes by you.
[2002.70 → 2003.92] You breathe it in.
[2004.34 → 2005.42] And you see it.
[2005.54 → 2009.02] And you're just like, ooh, what is that?
[2010.02 → 2012.10] And you call the waiter over.
[2012.50 → 2014.24] And you ask her, you know, what are they having?
[2014.40 → 2015.70] And you say, I want one of those.
[2016.68 → 2019.16] And because the smell hits you.
[2019.24 → 2025.42] And at that moment you realize that this is exactly what you were looking for.
[2026.40 → 2029.88] And I think we probably all had kind of an experience similar to that.
[2029.88 → 2037.54] And it's this moment when our hunger, in a way that we did not expect, finally encounters its true object.
[2038.40 → 2043.34] And we say, yes, this is exactly what I wanted.
[2044.50 → 2049.02] You know, in our passage today, Jesus is with a bunch of starving people.
[2049.78 → 2050.02] Right?
[2050.12 → 2051.22] They know they're hungry.
[2051.96 → 2053.16] Jesus knows they're hungry.
[2053.16 → 2057.34] But they don't know exactly what they're hungry for.
[2058.08 → 2060.20] And indeed, they can't even imagine the fullness.
[2060.96 → 2061.98] That's possible.
[2063.12 → 2068.80] But in this passage, what we see happening is that Jesus, in a sense, sits them down at the table.
[2069.56 → 2073.22] And he reveals to them what they're starving for.
[2073.68 → 2079.86] And he reveals to them the fullness and satisfaction that only he can bring.
[2079.86 → 2083.76] And so that's what I want to look at from this passage this morning.
[2084.32 → 2088.26] That in this passage, Jesus seeks to reveal three things to us.
[2088.76 → 2091.24] He seeks to reveal the hunger that we have.
[2092.14 → 2095.46] The fullness, secondly, the fullness that he brings.
[2096.28 → 2101.22] And then thirdly, what we have to do to receive this fullness.
[2101.96 → 2103.20] Okay, so that's what we're going to look at today.
[2103.72 → 2109.12] So the first thing Jesus reveals is the hunger that we have.
[2109.92 → 2116.10] You know, and one of the most consistent things that the Bible tells us about who we are is that we're hungry people.
[2117.10 → 2117.32] Right?
[2117.38 → 2121.68] That in a sense, we are not in ourselves complete.
[2122.24 → 2125.42] That there is actually an absence in us.
[2126.22 → 2133.68] You know, and I think so many times we often admire people who we think have been successful in life.
[2133.68 → 2135.36] Who have kind of made it.
[2135.36 → 2138.64] And we imagine that they have it all.
[2138.74 → 2146.28] That somehow that they have finally kind of eaten of life and have found the satisfaction that all of us are still looking for.
[2146.28 → 2155.08] You know, but even those people, you know, maybe whether they are celebrities in music or sports or whether they're a tech CEO.
[2156.08 → 2158.84] You know, it's kind of like they've made it to the top of a mountain.
[2159.08 → 2162.32] And all of us are down there at the base of the mountain looking up at them.
[2162.32 → 2168.42] But they get to the top of the mountain and what we hear them say is that there's nothing up here.
[2170.22 → 2178.54] Even when we get to the top, there is still a hunger inside of us that cannot be satisfied.
[2178.54 → 2187.58] And I think that in this world of self-sufficiency, when we imagine that we can have everything that we need and want,
[2188.22 → 2194.96] this can be a humbling realization of who we are as men and women, that we are hungry people.
[2194.96 → 2200.80] Now, the people in this passage actually knew that they were hungry.
[2201.42 → 2205.76] I mean, they're actually following Jesus all around because they're hungry.
[2206.24 → 2214.68] And that's why at the beginning of the chapter, Jesus performed the miracle of multiplying the loaves and the fish and feeding thousands of people
[2214.68 → 2219.46] because they were actually hungry, and they didn't have food with them.
[2219.68 → 2221.00] And Jesus fed them.
[2221.00 → 2231.76] But in our passage, Jesus is trying to tell them that while he understands the reality of their true hunger,
[2232.92 → 2239.26] they have not yet come to realize the true object of their hunger.
[2239.76 → 2241.94] In other words, they understand the fact of their hunger,
[2241.94 → 2249.94] but they have not yet come to understand that they can finally be satisfied in what Jesus can give them.
[2251.00 → 2258.18] And so the earlier part of this passage really hinges on these two types of hunger that they have.
[2259.14 → 2265.68] And so the first one that we see here is just the hunger for sustenance, the hunger for food.
[2266.60 → 2267.88] They want to be fed.
[2268.94 → 2272.60] And so remember, Jesus had just fed them on the other side of the lake,
[2272.92 → 2276.16] and he goes across to the other side.
[2276.16 → 2281.52] The people discover he's not there, so they get in some boats, they go across the lake, and they're going to find Jesus.
[2282.32 → 2286.04] And when they get there and find Jesus, they act all surprised.
[2286.16 → 2289.42] They're like, hey, Rabbi, what are you doing here?
[2289.94 → 2291.52] Imagine meeting you like this.
[2292.66 → 2298.10] And so they have this hunger, and they're following Jesus, but they're kind of embarrassed about it,
[2298.10 → 2304.58] and they're trying to hide it, acting like this is just this coincidental meeting that they just find Jesus on the other side of the lake.
[2305.24 → 2307.40] And Jesus says, look, I know why you're here.
[2307.94 → 2310.90] He says you're hungry, and you want some bread.
[2311.70 → 2313.34] And they don't dispute that.
[2314.34 → 2316.46] And so that's the first thing that they're hungry for.
[2317.04 → 2321.88] They want food, and they think that Jesus is going to provide it for them.
[2321.88 → 2329.08] But there's another hunger that they have here that they're also aware of, right?
[2329.16 → 2332.14] And it's a hunger for religious experience.
[2333.00 → 2339.22] Because the miracle of Jesus feeding them with bread, on the one hand, it addressed their material needs.
[2339.22 → 2341.64] Like they were hungry, they needed to be fed.
[2342.20 → 2345.12] But it also spoke to their religious identity.
[2345.64 → 2351.28] Because remember, this crowd who are following Jesus are a Jewish community.
[2351.28 → 2357.68] And they knew the stories about how God had fed his people through Moses in the wilderness.
[2359.44 → 2362.26] But those were old stories.
[2363.00 → 2366.60] I mean, God had not even spoken to his people for like 400 years.
[2367.22 → 2375.24] And now all of a sudden they see someone feeding them miraculously in the wilderness, again, with bread.
[2375.92 → 2380.56] And they think, wait a minute, this is happening again.
[2380.56 → 2382.76] This is the new Moses.
[2383.00 → 2388.20] Or earlier in the passage, they say, this is the new prophet who is to come.
[2389.16 → 2389.46] Right?
[2389.52 → 2391.66] Because they were looking for a second Moses.
[2391.84 → 2399.14] They were looking for a redeemer who, as Psalm 73 says, would make grain abound throughout the land.
[2399.64 → 2401.58] This was their hope and expectation.
[2401.58 → 2412.68] And so after Jesus fed them in this miraculous way, the text tells us earlier that they immediately want to make Jesus their king.
[2413.18 → 2413.82] Right?
[2413.86 → 2417.94] They wanted him to be the Messiah, which he was.
[2418.58 → 2424.78] But they wanted to define what it meant to be the Messiah.
[2424.78 → 2430.90] And to them, the Messiah would be someone who would finally free them from the tyranny of Rome.
[2431.42 → 2435.94] And who would make sure that they could always eat and that they would not starve.
[2437.52 → 2439.46] And I think this is so interesting.
[2440.22 → 2440.32] Right?
[2440.32 → 2447.64] They say, I'm going to take Jesus, and I'm going to make him be the Messiah that I want him to be.
[2448.14 → 2457.16] And friends, I don't think that often we are that far off in our own attempts to make God into our own image.
[2457.16 → 2457.76] Right?
[2457.82 → 2461.16] To make him be the God that we want him to be.
[2461.74 → 2466.64] That, you know, for God to get on board with our plan for our lives.
[2467.06 → 2471.80] Rather than allowing Christ to actually make us in his image.
[2473.32 → 2480.06] So they want to experience again what ancient Israel experienced of having this great prophet from God like Moses.
[2480.06 → 2490.80] And so they're following Jesus thinking that if they follow him, he will provide the religious experience that they're looking for.
[2492.94 → 2497.62] And now, they're not actually wrong about either of those things.
[2498.22 → 2498.38] Right?
[2498.50 → 2505.00] They do need food to meet their hunger, which is why Jesus saw it and provided it.
[2505.60 → 2507.44] He saw their need, and he gave them food.
[2507.44 → 2512.78] They do need an encounter with the living God, which is why Jesus came in the first place.
[2512.84 → 2513.76] So they're not wrong.
[2514.52 → 2517.36] And yet, we see in this passage that Jesus still confronts them.
[2518.04 → 2524.74] And what he does is he tells them that these hungers that they have, while they are real, they are not fundamental.
[2525.92 → 2530.84] There is a deeper hunger that they still have not yet seen.
[2532.02 → 2534.04] And friends, do you know what that hunger is?
[2534.04 → 2538.46] Jesus tells us it is not for bread and fish.
[2539.10 → 2541.40] It is not for religious experience.
[2541.74 → 2543.06] But it's for a person.
[2544.12 → 2548.56] Jesus says, what you're actually hungry for is me.
[2549.92 → 2552.20] And so look at what he says to them in verse 35.
[2552.44 → 2554.80] He says, I am the bread of life.
[2555.44 → 2558.08] Whoever comes to me will never go hungry.
[2558.08 → 2563.84] And don't you think that is unbelievable, what he says to them?
[2564.48 → 2564.68] Right?
[2564.74 → 2571.72] Of all the various hungers that we as human beings can have, Jesus says, actually, what you really want is me.
[2572.56 → 2575.88] I am the true bread that can feed you.
[2577.18 → 2579.18] That's what Jesus came to reveal.
[2579.18 → 2581.00] And so that's what I want us to see here.
[2581.86 → 2585.88] That what Jesus is doing is he's revealing the true hunger that we have.
[2586.42 → 2591.14] He's trying to show them and us that behind all the hungers that we have as people,
[2591.70 → 2596.18] that there is one hunger that is deeper and more fundamental than all of them.
[2596.38 → 2600.76] And that cannot be satisfied by anything that this world has to offer.
[2601.54 → 2602.86] And it's a hunger for Jesus.
[2602.86 → 2608.46] But there's another revelation that Jesus seeks to bring here.
[2608.54 → 2609.60] And this is our second point.
[2610.18 → 2613.40] And it's not just the hunger that we have.
[2614.20 → 2617.48] He also reveals the fullness that he brings.
[2618.46 → 2624.12] Now remember, the people in this passage already knew that Jesus came to give them stuff.
[2624.74 → 2624.86] Right?
[2624.90 → 2629.06] That's why they're following him all around, because they want things from him.
[2629.06 → 2635.88] But they haven't really understood the fullness of what Jesus actually came to bring to them.
[2636.66 → 2639.20] And this is also what Jesus wants to reveal.
[2639.32 → 2641.80] He wants to reveal not only the true hunger that they have,
[2642.08 → 2645.44] but he wants to show them what he can actually give them.
[2646.44 → 2648.70] And so this is also what we want to find out.
[2649.62 → 2655.66] So what Jesus does here is he begins to explain what it means that he is the bread of life.
[2655.66 → 2660.74] Now obviously, he's not literally saying, I am a sourdough.
[2661.42 → 2663.10] He's not saying, I am a pretzel.
[2663.44 → 2664.38] He's using a metaphor.
[2665.10 → 2666.12] I am the bread of life.
[2666.20 → 2669.44] And so we have to understand, well, what does he mean when he says, I am the bread of life?
[2670.60 → 2678.88] And so the main way he does that in this passage is he begins to distinguish between the bread that Moses gave to the people of Israel,
[2679.24 → 2683.02] which is actually from God, that bread, and himself.
[2683.02 → 2685.62] And so he says in verse 48,
[2686.14 → 2687.30] I am the bread of life.
[2688.06 → 2691.66] Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
[2692.46 → 2698.56] But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.
[2699.78 → 2700.00] Right?
[2700.06 → 2705.56] So God had fed the people of Israel in the wilderness for years on manna.
[2705.84 → 2710.66] And so manna was this flake, grain-like substance.
[2710.66 → 2715.34] Well, it was grain, it was a flaky substance, that appeared to them every morning.
[2716.22 → 2720.14] And so every day, except on the Sabbath, the manna would appear when they woke up,
[2720.40 → 2725.22] and the Jews would go and gather it, and they referred to it as bread from heaven.
[2725.22 → 2727.60] And Jesus says,
[2728.28 → 2735.64] I too am something sent by the Father to the people, but I am actually different from that.
[2735.82 → 2740.94] Because the life the manna gave in the desert was always a temporary life.
[2741.70 → 2741.80] Right?
[2741.88 → 2744.04] Every single day, you had to go out and gather.
[2744.40 → 2748.38] And every single day, you had to take that manna, you had to bake bread, and you had to eat.
[2748.38 → 2753.90] And friends, we also have to eat continually every single day, or else we will die.
[2754.80 → 2760.20] But in contrast, Jesus is saying that he can eternally satisfy our hunger.
[2761.00 → 2761.28] He says,
[2761.44 → 2765.94] The fullness with which I've come to feed you is the fullness of eternal life.
[2767.60 → 2771.76] And so, and that's a phrase that we see over and over again in this passage.
[2771.90 → 2774.58] In one way or another, he's talking about eternal life.
[2774.62 → 2776.14] We see it like ten times in this passage.
[2776.14 → 2777.54] That's what this is about.
[2777.70 → 2779.16] Jesus is the bread of life.
[2779.96 → 2780.96] He is eternal life.
[2781.04 → 2784.58] So, now we have to ask, well, what is eternal life?
[2785.42 → 2787.84] You know, this is a phrase that we use all the time in church.
[2789.08 → 2791.84] That Jesus gives us eternal life.
[2792.32 → 2793.58] But what is eternal life?
[2794.80 → 2796.60] Someone once said,
[2797.26 → 2800.52] The idea of eternal life makes me feel tired.
[2800.52 → 2807.38] But I think if the idea of eternal life sounds exhausting,
[2807.76 → 2812.78] like it's just this kind of weary life and all of its struggles forward into eternity,
[2813.00 → 2814.16] like, yeah, that's exhausting.
[2814.66 → 2817.46] But I think that's obviously missing the point.
[2817.82 → 2819.44] That's not what Jesus is talking about.
[2819.74 → 2821.02] So, what is eternal life?
[2821.02 → 2825.78] And to understand this, friends, we have to understand the story of the Bible.
[2826.56 → 2829.78] Okay, so let's, we're going to actually review this story quickly.
[2829.90 → 2830.86] And this is what it is.
[2831.46 → 2833.06] That the Bible begins with God.
[2833.82 → 2837.20] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit living together,
[2837.38 → 2841.86] the eternal life dwelling together from all eternity.
[2841.86 → 2845.32] But because God is so loving,
[2845.56 → 2849.58] this Trinitarian relationship of mutual love and joy,
[2849.98 → 2854.42] there's so much love there that he actually desired to share in his life.
[2855.12 → 2858.94] For his life to, in a sense, overflow into others.
[2859.34 → 2863.86] So he made human beings so that we could share in his life.
[2864.44 → 2866.12] That's what creation is all about.
[2866.72 → 2870.92] That is a very participation in the life and the goodness of God.
[2870.92 → 2873.94] Friends, that is what we were made for.
[2874.66 → 2876.06] In case you wanted to ask,
[2877.32 → 2878.96] this is the meaning of your life.
[2879.50 → 2882.16] To share in God's eternal life.
[2883.16 → 2888.60] But what happened was we rejected the life that God had given us
[2888.60 → 2893.42] and we ceased to feed on and partake of him.
[2894.28 → 2898.48] Instead, we put our hands out and we took lesser fruit.
[2898.48 → 2901.66] And as a result, we were exiled from God's presence.
[2902.48 → 2905.08] And when that happened, what began to happen?
[2906.22 → 2908.14] The Bible says we began to die.
[2909.28 → 2910.60] That's what God said would happen.
[2910.96 → 2912.54] He said, you will surely die.
[2913.54 → 2917.60] And that's what happened because death came into the world.
[2918.00 → 2922.16] And now the eternal life of God was for us the forbidden fruit.
[2922.16 → 2923.72] We were not able to get to it.
[2924.86 → 2927.96] But God, now friends, because he loves us,
[2928.36 → 2931.44] he promised to bring us back to himself.
[2932.00 → 2935.78] To make us once again partakers of his eternal life again.
[2936.38 → 2939.26] That's the original redemptive promise of the Bible
[2939.26 → 2943.12] that we can once again share in the eternal life of God.
[2943.12 → 2946.10] So now, throughout the Old Testament,
[2946.40 → 2948.14] everyone's trying to get to this life.
[2948.82 → 2950.28] We've been exiled from God.
[2950.44 → 2953.10] God is giving us these hints that he is coming
[2953.10 → 2955.22] and he is going to bring this life to us.
[2955.76 → 2958.48] And so we see little manifestations of it here and there.
[2958.74 → 2960.74] You know, we see manna coming in the wilderness.
[2961.20 → 2963.14] We see water flowing from a rock.
[2963.44 → 2965.38] We see flowers blooming in the wilderness.
[2965.38 → 2970.44] All of these are hints of the life that eventually will burst forth.
[2971.34 → 2974.44] But we really never see it come in its fullness.
[2975.44 → 2978.92] God's people are still in exile away from God.
[2979.94 → 2981.42] But then in the New Testament,
[2981.82 → 2984.84] this book of John opens up with these words.
[2986.02 → 2988.40] And so in light of the context of eternal life
[2988.40 → 2989.50] that we're talking about here,
[2989.70 → 2991.98] I want you to listen again to John chapter 1.
[2992.86 → 2993.76] This is what it says.
[2993.76 → 2996.26] In the beginning was the Word.
[2997.04 → 2998.96] And the Word was with God.
[2999.34 → 3000.58] And the Word was God.
[3001.46 → 3003.16] In him was life.
[3003.90 → 3006.84] And that life was the light of all mankind.
[3007.92 → 3011.00] The true light that gives light to everyone
[3011.00 → 3013.30] was coming into the world.
[3014.22 → 3016.24] So friends, what's John saying here?
[3016.68 → 3020.02] He's saying that this triune life that has always existed,
[3020.02 → 3023.76] from which you and I have been separated because of sin,
[3023.96 → 3026.02] is actually coming back to us.
[3026.66 → 3029.88] God is bringing his own eternal life back into this world
[3029.88 → 3032.70] so that you can partake of it again,
[3033.08 → 3035.24] which is what you were created to do.
[3035.24 → 3040.62] C.S. Lewis in Mere Christianity comments that
[3040.62 → 3042.92] what happened at the fall of humanity,
[3042.92 → 3043.92] in his opinion,
[3044.92 → 3046.42] is that when we sinned,
[3046.46 → 3048.42] we retained our physical life
[3048.42 → 3050.44] because we didn't die immediately,
[3051.02 → 3052.74] right, after we ate the forbidden fruit.
[3053.44 → 3057.30] But he says our spiritual life was snatched away from us
[3057.30 → 3058.08] because of sin.
[3058.08 → 3061.50] And he says that we were real creatures
[3061.50 → 3063.48] turned to stone.
[3064.36 → 3067.66] And you can hear hints of Narnia, right, in that,
[3067.82 → 3068.78] if you know the story.
[3069.78 → 3071.92] And what Jesus is doing as the bread of life
[3071.92 → 3073.58] is he's coming to rescue his people
[3073.58 → 3076.34] by coming to us who are only stone,
[3076.90 → 3078.72] and he's turning us back again,
[3078.82 → 3081.10] one by one, into real creatures.
[3081.76 → 3084.40] He's giving us this fullness of life,
[3084.40 → 3088.92] the life that is the true life of God,
[3088.98 → 3090.96] though, the life that only God has,
[3091.90 → 3093.16] and he's giving it to us again.
[3094.84 → 3097.32] And, you know, the crowd knows
[3097.32 → 3099.58] that Jesus has come to bring them something,
[3100.10 → 3102.50] but they don't know what it is.
[3103.16 → 3105.30] And so Jesus comes, and he reveals
[3105.30 → 3107.80] the fullness of life that he came to give to them.
[3108.12 → 3110.14] He says, I'm not just here to feed you.
[3110.32 → 3112.28] I'm not just here to heal you.
[3112.28 → 3114.20] I'm not just here to forgive you.
[3114.40 → 3115.44] And take away your guilt.
[3115.84 → 3117.46] I'm here to bring you the life
[3117.46 → 3118.90] for which you were made.
[3120.02 → 3122.44] And the only way of getting this life
[3122.44 → 3123.94] is through me.
[3125.78 → 3128.00] And we see this throughout the passage.
[3128.12 → 3129.84] This is what Jesus is going on about.
[3130.24 → 3132.22] But in particular, look at what he says
[3132.22 → 3134.46] in the beginning, starting in verse 54.
[3135.36 → 3136.22] This is what he says.
[3136.46 → 3139.74] Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
[3139.74 → 3141.20] has eternal life.
[3141.78 → 3144.24] And I will raise them up at the last day.
[3144.40 → 3146.50] For my flesh is real food
[3146.50 → 3148.64] and my blood is real drink.
[3149.46 → 3151.72] Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
[3151.72 → 3155.02] remains in me and I in them.
[3155.92 → 3156.14] Right?
[3156.22 → 3158.14] Just as the living Father sent me
[3158.14 → 3160.06] and I live because of the Father,
[3160.54 → 3161.88] so the one who feeds on me
[3161.88 → 3164.12] will live because of me.
[3164.28 → 3166.28] Do you see how Jesus is bringing us back
[3166.28 → 3167.86] into the life of God?
[3167.86 → 3170.80] And what he's saying here is so important
[3170.80 → 3173.74] that eternal life means God's own life
[3173.74 → 3175.34] coming back into the world.
[3175.98 → 3177.24] And Jesus is saying,
[3177.48 → 3179.28] this is the life for which you were made.
[3179.72 → 3181.34] And I am bringing it to you.
[3181.58 → 3183.52] And so feed on me by faith.
[3184.02 → 3186.28] Remain in me and I will remain in you.
[3186.28 → 3190.68] And friends, the only way to get to this
[3190.68 → 3192.52] true spiritual life,
[3192.60 → 3195.00] this life where we who are stone creatures
[3195.00 → 3196.74] can become alive again,
[3197.20 → 3199.06] where we are once again united
[3199.06 → 3200.58] to the eternal God,
[3200.66 → 3201.50] is through Jesus.
[3201.50 → 3207.40] And so that leads us now to our third point,
[3208.46 → 3209.58] which is to ask,
[3210.74 → 3212.68] you know, Jesus having revealed to us
[3212.68 → 3214.22] the hunger that we had,
[3214.26 → 3215.26] this fundamental hunger,
[3215.78 → 3217.80] and that he is the fullness of life
[3217.80 → 3219.36] that only he can provide.
[3220.56 → 3221.72] The next question is,
[3221.78 → 3222.92] well, how do we receive it?
[3223.00 → 3224.98] How do we get this life that Jesus came to bring?
[3226.12 → 3228.24] And Jesus answers that in this passage as well.
[3228.86 → 3229.96] In verse 28,
[3229.96 → 3231.88] Then they asked him,
[3231.98 → 3234.68] what must we do to do the works God requires?
[3235.32 → 3236.12] Jesus answered,
[3236.54 → 3237.84] the work of God is this,
[3238.30 → 3240.86] to believe in the one he has sent.
[3242.38 → 3244.64] And so what Jesus is telling us here
[3244.64 → 3249.20] is that the bread of life is not inaccessible.
[3249.98 → 3252.18] He's saying it is not unattainable.
[3252.56 → 3254.30] It's not up on some high mountain
[3254.30 → 3256.32] that we have to climb up and find it,
[3256.56 → 3258.56] but it has been given to us
[3258.56 → 3260.22] so that we can eat.
[3260.88 → 3261.42] He says,
[3261.58 → 3262.56] I am the bread of life
[3262.56 → 3265.70] that has come down from heaven
[3265.70 → 3268.64] that you might eat of it and live.
[3269.18 → 3270.54] See, friends, Jesus has come
[3270.54 → 3272.18] and he has made himself accessible.
[3272.94 → 3273.28] Right?
[3273.34 → 3274.44] And this is why the gospel
[3274.44 → 3276.18] is not about our attempt
[3276.18 → 3277.90] to reach God in the heavens.
[3278.00 → 3278.14] Right?
[3278.20 → 3279.30] Men and women have been trying
[3279.30 → 3280.22] to do that forever.
[3280.68 → 3282.84] But the gospel is down to earth.
[3282.84 → 3286.78] It's good news because God's divine initiative,
[3287.26 → 3290.08] when we couldn't get to God or reach him,
[3290.86 → 3292.36] he came to us.
[3292.98 → 3294.74] He came into our brokenness
[3294.74 → 3296.84] and the predicament of our sinfulness.
[3297.94 → 3300.34] And the way we take this bread and eat of it,
[3300.44 → 3301.12] Jesus says,
[3301.64 → 3303.12] is by believing in him.
[3304.22 → 3306.06] Jesus offers eternal life
[3306.06 → 3308.54] to all who embrace him by faith.
[3308.54 → 3310.78] So as we,
[3311.38 → 3313.82] to understand this idea of faith
[3313.82 → 3314.80] and believing in Jesus,
[3315.32 → 3316.68] I want to share with you a quote
[3316.68 → 3318.72] by Robert Farrah Capone.
[3319.76 → 3321.50] And he defines faith
[3321.50 → 3323.80] and so I want to share this quote with you.
[3323.88 → 3324.58] Here's what he says.
[3325.86 → 3328.80] Faith is something that I shall
[3328.80 → 3331.98] resolutely refuse to let mean anything
[3331.98 → 3334.18] other than trusting Jesus.
[3334.18 → 3338.30] It is simply saying yes to him
[3338.30 → 3339.84] rather than no.
[3340.64 → 3342.52] It does not necessarily involve
[3342.52 → 3344.68] any particular theological structure
[3344.68 → 3345.54] or formulation.
[3346.10 → 3348.68] It does not entail any particular degree
[3348.68 → 3350.08] of emotional fervour.
[3350.76 → 3351.84] And above all,
[3352.12 → 3355.00] it does not depend on any specific repertoire
[3355.00 → 3356.64] of good works,
[3357.02 → 3359.40] physical, mental, or moral.
[3359.86 → 3362.52] It's just yes, Jesus,
[3362.52 → 3364.16] until we die.
[3364.78 → 3367.20] Just letting the power of his resurrection
[3367.20 → 3369.22] do in our deaths
[3369.22 → 3371.84] what it has already done in his.
[3372.76 → 3373.94] Friends, I think this is such
[3373.94 → 3375.70] a powerful proclamation.
[3376.62 → 3378.38] That faith is nothing other
[3378.38 → 3381.16] than saying yes to Jesus.
[3382.38 → 3384.68] And notice that it is all God's work.
[3384.80 → 3385.56] It is not our,
[3385.76 → 3388.22] any repertoire of works that we can do,
[3388.64 → 3391.62] whether physical or mental or moral.
[3391.62 → 3393.64] It is all by God's grace,
[3394.00 → 3394.66] God's initiative,
[3394.98 → 3395.50] God's work.
[3397.10 → 3398.84] You know, the question that the crowds ask
[3398.84 → 3399.32] is plural.
[3399.48 → 3399.70] They say,
[3399.90 → 3402.02] what must we do to do the works of God?
[3402.64 → 3405.02] Jesus' answer is singular,
[3405.88 → 3406.98] trust me,
[3407.48 → 3408.82] I am the answer.
[3410.08 → 3411.78] And so what he is calling us to
[3411.78 → 3413.54] is a relationship with himself.
[3414.08 → 3415.86] It's to say yes
[3415.86 → 3418.08] to the yes that God has already spoken
[3418.08 → 3419.08] over us in Jesus.
[3419.08 → 3423.18] And so as we close,
[3423.28 → 3424.08] I want to kind of,
[3424.28 → 3425.72] I want to ask you a question
[3425.72 → 3427.80] kind of by way of practical application.
[3429.58 → 3431.66] Do you really believe
[3431.66 → 3434.44] that what you hunger for most is Jesus?
[3435.74 → 3436.94] Do you believe that?
[3438.00 → 3440.50] That beneath all the other hungers
[3440.50 → 3441.26] that you have,
[3442.10 → 3442.32] right,
[3442.38 → 3443.44] like hunger for meaning,
[3444.50 → 3445.92] hunger for esteem,
[3445.92 → 3446.76] or for beauty,
[3447.04 → 3447.90] or sex,
[3448.00 → 3448.64] or happiness?
[3449.38 → 3450.88] That these kinds of hungers
[3450.88 → 3451.92] that we have as people,
[3452.06 → 3452.20] right,
[3452.26 → 3453.04] do you believe
[3453.04 → 3455.96] that there is a more fundamental hunger
[3455.96 → 3458.62] that all of these other hungers
[3458.62 → 3459.88] point to?
[3460.60 → 3462.74] And that hunger is for the living God.
[3464.20 → 3466.52] This is what Jesus came to reveal to us,
[3466.56 → 3468.04] that he is the bread of life.
[3468.04 → 3471.04] And he came to offer us life eternal.
[3471.68 → 3473.42] And that everyone who trusts in him
[3473.42 → 3475.08] can enter in
[3475.08 → 3477.14] and not only be forgiven,
[3477.50 → 3478.94] can not only go to heaven,
[3479.26 → 3481.20] but live with God,
[3481.32 → 3484.04] have the eternal life of the triune God
[3484.04 → 3485.88] now and forever.
[3486.82 → 3487.06] Right,
[3487.10 → 3488.20] that's the fullness of life
[3488.20 → 3489.40] that Jesus came to bring.
[3490.38 → 3491.98] And his invitation to you
[3491.98 → 3493.00] and to me this morning
[3493.00 → 3493.80] is,
[3494.28 → 3495.78] would you eat this bread
[3495.78 → 3496.74] and live?
[3497.62 → 3499.30] So let me pray that we would do that.
[3499.78 → 3500.42] Let's pray together.
[3503.42 → 3503.94] Father,
[3504.42 → 3506.98] we come to you empty-handed
[3506.98 → 3509.34] and we go to you
[3509.34 → 3511.20] because only you
[3511.20 → 3512.58] can satisfy.
[3513.22 → 3514.06] Only you
[3514.06 → 3516.44] can bring us back
[3516.44 → 3517.86] into the life of God
[3517.86 → 3519.36] for which we were made.
[3519.86 → 3521.28] Only you can make us once again
[3521.28 → 3522.52] living creatures.
[3522.52 → 3524.48] But Lord,
[3524.54 → 3525.92] we confess that we often
[3525.92 → 3527.76] seek for life in other things.
[3527.86 → 3528.08] And Lord,
[3528.14 → 3529.40] would you constantly
[3529.40 → 3530.86] remind us
[3530.86 → 3531.70] and point us
[3531.70 → 3532.24] to Jesus
[3532.24 → 3534.16] who is our life
[3534.16 → 3535.68], and would we feast on him?
[3536.46 → 3537.16] We pray
[3537.16 → 3538.78] in Jesus' name.
[3539.30 → 3539.60] Amen.
[3541.60 → 3542.40] So we're going to sing
[3542.40 → 3543.38] our song of response.
[3543.98 → 3544.24] And
[3544.24 → 3546.14] this is a new song
[3546.14 → 3547.12] that we're going to learn.
[3547.24 → 3547.70] It's called
[3547.70 → 3549.82] We Will Feast in the House of Zion
[3549.82 → 3551.00] by Sandra McCracken.
[3551.00 → 3552.16] I think it's a great song
[3552.16 → 3554.22] to reveal to us again
[3554.22 → 3555.66] that we are invited
[3555.66 → 3557.06] to feast with God.
[3557.26 → 3558.56] So let's learn this song
[3558.56 → 3559.20] and sing together.
[3559.20 → 3579.86] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[3579.86 → 3586.66] He will feast in the house of Zion.
[3586.66 → 3588.48] He has done great things
[3588.48 → 3591.82] we will say together.
[3592.32 → 3594.70] We will feast
[3594.70 → 3598.48] and weep no more.
[3598.48 → 3607.44] We will not be burned by the fire
[3607.44 → 3613.52] He is the Lord our God
[3613.52 → 3619.74] We are not consumed by the fire
[3619.74 → 3626.96] Of hell protected gathered
[3626.96 → 3633.96] We will feast in the house of Zion
[3634.74 → 3639.96] We will sing with our hearts restored
[3640.48 → 3643.34] He has done great things
[3643.34 → 3646.78] We will sing together
[3646.78 → 3652.96] We will feast and weep no more
[3656.96 → 3663.96] In the dark of night before the dawn
[3663.96 → 3668.96] My soul be not afraid
[3668.96 → 3674.96] For the promised morning oh how long
[3674.96 → 3681.96] Oh God of Jacob be my strength
[3681.96 → 3688.96] We will feast in the house of Zion
[3688.96 → 3693.96] We will sing with our hearts restored
[3693.96 → 3696.96] He has done great things
[3696.96 → 3700.96] We will say together
[3700.96 → 3706.96] We will feast and weep no more
[3706.96 → 3711.96] We will sing with our hearts restored
[3711.96 → 3716.96] Every family broken and betrayed
[3716.96 → 3722.96] You are the faithful one
[3722.96 → 3729.96] And from the garden to the grave
[3729.96 → 3732.96] Find us together
[3732.96 → 3736.96] We will sing with our hearts restored
[3736.96 → 3740.96] He has done great things
[3740.96 → 3744.96] We will say together
[3744.96 → 3746.96] We will feast and weep no more
[3746.96 → 3749.96] We will sing with our hearts restored
[3749.96 → 3764.10] He has done great things we will say together. We will feast and weep no longer.
[3764.10 → 3782.74] So brothers and sisters, we come today to the Lord's table, and we're reminded once again that Jesus is the bread of life.
[3783.70 → 3796.78] And so as an affirmation of the fullness of the life that he came to bring, that he came to feed us not only with bread and cup, but actually with his very self.
[3797.42 → 3799.96] To show us that, he set up this table.
[3801.02 → 3807.74] And he says, when you partake of this, when you eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you are actually abiding with me.
[3807.74 → 3815.54] And that eating and drinking at this table is part of what it means to dwell with God by faith.
[3816.98 → 3829.96] And so if friends, you have put your faith in Jesus, if you have believed in him as he said we must do, and if you have been baptized, then this table is for you.
[3830.04 → 3833.58] And Jesus invites you to come and to feed on him by faith.
[3833.58 → 3843.24] If you are not yet a follower of Jesus, if you are still trying to kind of figure out who Jesus is and what he revealed himself to be,
[3843.96 → 3847.26] then we encourage you to spend this time in prayer.
[3847.88 → 3854.94] And our hope is that this time can be helpful to you as you consider your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[3854.94 → 3861.32] And so hear these words of institution spoken by the Apostle Paul.
[3862.12 → 3865.36] That the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[3865.90 → 3871.82] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you.
[3872.46 → 3874.14] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3876.68 → 3883.54] The same way also he took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[3883.54 → 3887.46] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[3888.98 → 3897.76] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[3898.36 → 3903.48] And so brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God to the people of God.
[3903.48 → 3912.62] And he invites us to feed on him in our hearts by faith with Thanksgiving because Jesus has died for us.
[3917.66 → 3921.58] And so at this time, I invite you to take your bread.
[3921.58 → 3929.12] And friends, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you.
[3929.76 → 3930.70] Let's eat together.
[3930.70 → 3950.62] Now take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of your Lord Jesus Christ was shed for your forgiveness.
[3951.26 → 3952.14] Let's drink together.
[3952.14 → 3952.22] Let's drink together.
[3952.22 → 3960.68] Let's drink together.
[3960.68 → 3967.24] Our Heavenly Father, we praise you, and we thank you, and we proclaim your name until you come again.
[3968.00 → 3972.36] The name that you have spoken, saying, I am the bread of life.
[3972.36 → 3980.12] So Lord, we thank you, and we thank you and that you have fed us.
[3980.68 → 3984.40] And Lord, we ask that you would help us to invite others to this table.
[3984.96 → 3996.72] That you would send us out into the byways, calling all who would hear to come and feast in your house, the house of Zion, for which they were made to do.
[3996.72 → 4005.70] And Lord, give us the strength to follow you, to obey you, to walk with you, to follow as your disciple, our Lord Jesus.
[4006.38 → 4007.74] We pray in his holy name.
[4008.20 → 4008.42] Amen.
[4008.42 → 4008.54] Amen.
[4008.54 → 4017.76] So now let's hear this word of blessing as we go forth from here.
[4018.10 → 4026.30] And I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the blessing, the good words of God the Father.
[4026.30 → 4027.30] Amen.
[4027.30 → 4035.30] To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence, without fault and with great joy.
[4035.90 → 4046.80] To the only God, our Saviour, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore.
[4046.80 → 4047.80] Amen.
[4076.80 → 4077.80] Amen.

[4096.34 → 4098.02] Amen.
[4098.02 → 4106.74] Oh, I love you.
[4106.74 → 4115.14] Great and mighty King, you are faithful.
[4117.22 → 4123.22] Through the ages, you never changed.
[4125.18 → 4128.40] Be my guide for the road ahead.
[4128.40 → 4133.48] Should I feel beside you, are just and good.
[4133.48 → 4143.02] I want to trust in you, and in all I do, bring you honour and praise.
[4143.46 → 4154.88] How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful.
[4154.88 → 4162.28] Through the ages, you never changed.
[4162.36 → 4173.88] How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful.
[4173.88 → 4182.20] Through the ages, you never changed.
[4182.20 → 4191.14] How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful.
[4191.14 → 4195.82] How I love you, great and mighty King, you are faithful.
