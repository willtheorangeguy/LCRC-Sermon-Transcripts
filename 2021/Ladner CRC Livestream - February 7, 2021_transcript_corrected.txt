[0.82 → 4.04] Alexander my Logo
[4.04 → 6.00] Lord, how I'll show you
[6.00 → 8.22] He says to you
[8.32 → 9.70] in Him the Lord
[15.30 → 16.38] one is His name
[17.60 → 21.68] 45
[21.68 → 23.50] John
[23.50 → 25.60] Sir
[25.60 → 26.00] Tooth
[26.00 → 26.64] Ton
[26.64 → 27.60] Awesome
[27.60 → 28.10] Hear
[28.10 → 30.10] Amen.
[58.10 → 60.10] Amen.
[88.10 → 94.86] Are we okay?
[118.10 → 120.10] Amen.
[148.10 → 169.10] Good morning and welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church on a beautiful sunny day.
[169.32 → 177.58] It is good to be with you in spirit wherever you are at home, maybe with family or friends or alone in your house.
[178.10 → 184.00] And we are glad that you are joining with us and that we can share in this time of worship together.
[185.52 → 191.96] One quick announcement, our offering is for North America Indigenous Ministries.
[192.64 → 196.32] Specifically, it is for the work of Howard and Janie Johnson.
[197.38 → 205.14] And funds that are collected are used for their ministry, which is in three different communities around Chase, B.C.
[205.14 → 213.30] And so you can support this ministry and our work as a church, of course, online or by sending in a check.
[215.02 → 219.36] So let's prepare our hearts to worship the Lord together this morning.
[220.16 → 226.06] We are gathered here today because God, our Creator, desires to have a relationship with us.
[226.86 → 232.50] And whether we realize it or not, He is the one who calls us to Himself.
[232.50 → 236.66] Today and every day of our lives.
[237.40 → 241.50] So our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 113.
[241.70 → 244.82] We'll have a call and response here on the screen.
[245.50 → 250.12] So I invite you to participate and read where the words are in bold.
[250.12 → 253.36] Praise the Lord.
[253.36 → 253.42] Praise the Lord.
[254.02 → 256.24] Praise the Lord, you His servants.
[257.02 → 259.42] Praise the name of the Lord.
[260.42 → 265.84] Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.
[266.64 → 273.76] From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[273.76 → 280.12] The Lord is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens.
[281.02 → 290.26] Who is like the Lord our God, the one who sits enthroned on high, who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?
[291.40 → 296.26] He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap.
[296.78 → 301.38] He seats them with princes and the princes of His people.
[302.10 → 303.30] Praise the Lord.
[303.30 → 309.06] And so our Lord has called us to worship Him.
[309.70 → 312.64] And now He greets us with these words from the book of Jude.
[313.70 → 319.78] To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,
[320.54 → 324.74] mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[326.76 → 330.30] So as God has greeted us, let's also greet one another.
[330.30 → 334.56] And maybe you can say these words to those who are sitting with at home.
[335.10 → 340.78] Or also maybe grab your phone and send a text to someone that you know.
[341.30 → 342.60] So here are these words.
[342.66 → 343.34] Let's say them now.
[343.44 → 347.24] The peace of the Lord be with you and also with you.
[347.76 → 353.86] So would you join me in a response to God's call, in a response to His welcome to us this morning?
[353.86 → 356.26] Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[356.62 → 357.48] Let's pray together.
[357.48 → 366.14] Our Heavenly Father, Triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[366.14 → 370.44] Lord, You have called us from death to life.
[370.56 → 379.72] You have called us from coldness to the passion of knowing You and being known by You.
[379.72 → 386.94] And so, Lord, we worship You as the God who has created us, the God who has redeemed us,
[387.44 → 394.26] the God who is at work in this world, undoing all that is broken, healing all that needs to be mended.
[395.40 → 401.40] And so, Lord, we come to worship You this morning, to find our true home, our hearts rest in You.
[401.40 → 406.72] So, Lord, would You be here with us by Your Spirit wherever we are, in our living rooms or wherever.
[407.56 → 412.38] Lord, and would You work in us through this time of prayer and worship and Scripture.
[413.16 → 415.66] Would You make us Your faithful servants.
[416.16 → 417.52] We pray in Jesus' name.
[418.34 → 418.64] Amen.
[419.40 → 422.66] So let's sing some songs of praise together this morning.
[431.40 → 442.30] Let's sing along, glory and power, be unto the nations of kings.
[443.56 → 452.54] From every nation, all creation, bow before the nations of kings.
[453.64 → 458.80] Every tongue in heaven and all shall declare Your glory.
[458.80 → 462.00] Every knee shall bow at pure throne
[462.00 → 467.16] In worship you will be exalted, O God
[467.16 → 471.76] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[471.76 → 476.24] O ancient of days
[476.24 → 483.24] Blessed in honour, glory and power
[483.24 → 487.40] Be unto the ancient of grace
[487.40 → 492.96] From every nation, all creation
[492.96 → 497.40] Bow before the ancient of days
[497.40 → 501.48] Every tongue in heaven and earth
[501.48 → 503.68] Shall declare your glory
[503.68 → 506.86] Every knee shall bow at pure throne
[506.86 → 512.06] In worship you will be exalted, O God
[512.06 → 516.58] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[516.58 → 522.14] O ancient of days
[522.14 → 527.58] Our kingdom shall reign over all the earth
[527.58 → 533.14] Sing unto the ancient of days
[533.14 → 537.66] For none can compare to your angels
[537.66 → 542.70] Sing unto the ancient of days
[542.70 → 546.14] Every tongue in heaven and earth
[546.14 → 548.14] Shall declare your glory
[548.14 → 550.70] Every knee shall bow at pure throne
[550.70 → 556.70] In worship you will be exalted, O God
[556.70 → 560.26] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[560.26 → 565.82] O God
[565.82 → 567.26] And your kingdom shall not pass away
[567.26 → 575.82] O God
[575.82 → 576.82] You are my God
[576.82 → 577.38] You are my God
[577.38 → 578.38] Earnestly I seek you
[578.38 → 580.38] My soul thirsts for you
[580.38 → 581.38] My body longs for you
[581.38 → 582.38] In a dry and weary land
[582.38 → 583.82] In a dry and weary land
[583.82 → 584.94] Where there is no water
[584.94 → 586.94] I have seen you in the sanctuary
[586.94 → 588.54] And your glory and beheld your power
[588.54 → 589.50] And your glory
[589.50 → 590.46] And your glory
[590.46 → 596.50] My soul longs for the Lord
[596.50 → 601.50] In a weary land
[601.50 → 603.06] And your glory and weary land
[603.06 → 604.06] O Lord
[604.06 → 605.06] In a weary land
[605.06 → 606.06] In a weary land
[606.06 → 607.06] In a weary land
[607.06 → 608.06] In a weary land
[608.06 → 609.06] In a weary land
[609.06 → 610.06] In a weary land
[610.06 → 611.06] In a weary land
[611.06 → 611.12] In a weary land
[611.12 → 612.20] How I yearn
[612.20 → 613.60] How I yearn
[613.60 → 615.36] For strength so mercy
[615.36 → 617.06] Where my soul
[617.06 → 619.06] Can be restored
[619.06 → 621.06] Come and drink
[621.06 → 621.62] And your glory
[621.62 → 623.62] Jesus loves me
[623.62 → 626.18] And you will thirst
[626.18 → 627.62] No more
[627.62 → 631.84] All the fullness of Christ
[631.84 → 636.20] Right above one of life
[636.20 → 643.62] Living world
[643.62 → 646.04] You have come upon us
[646.04 → 649.10] Now Emmanuel
[649.10 → 653.98] And you spoke into the darkness
[653.98 → 657.98] Broken powers of heaven
[657.98 → 662.12] Praise and mercy flow from Calvary
[662.12 → 666.08] To the valley of our need
[666.08 → 668.06] In his coming
[668.06 → 670.54] He is finished
[670.54 → 674.12] From every sin set free
[674.12 → 678.12] All the victory of Christ
[678.12 → 683.00] I am the power of God
[683.00 → 692.24] How often in the stillness
[692.24 → 696.00] Have I heard your voice
[696.00 → 698.12] Every whisper
[698.12 → 700.28] Every voice
[700.28 → 704.10] As my heart to rejoice
[704.10 → 708.10] In the quiet of the morning
[708.10 → 712.10] Through the watchers of the night
[712.10 → 714.96] In the far home
[714.96 → 716.54] The struggles
[716.54 → 718.56] The spirit of joy
[718.56 → 720.10] They fight
[720.10 → 724.16] On the power of Christ
[724.16 → 725.94] One of God
[725.94 → 728.28] One of God
[728.28 → 751.16] We will see the battle
[751.16 → 754.16] We will feel the night
[754.16 → 756.90] We will walk the valley
[756.90 → 759.24] With you my son
[759.24 → 762.28] You will go before us
[762.28 → 764.24] You will lead the way
[764.24 → 767.10] We have found a refuge
[767.10 → 769.68] Only you can save
[769.68 → 773.42] Sing with joy now
[773.42 → 775.42] Our God is for us
[775.42 → 775.74] Our God is for us
[775.74 → 777.74] The Father's love
[777.74 → 780.48] Is a strong and mighty fortress
[780.48 → 783.22] They show us now
[783.22 → 785.24] The love is greater
[785.24 → 787.58] You can stand against us
[787.58 → 791.16] If our God is for us
[791.16 → 797.16] Even when I stumble
[797.16 → 799.16] Even when I fall
[799.16 → 802.16] Even when I turn back
[802.16 → 804.16] Still your heart is full
[804.16 → 807.16] You will learn and learn
[807.16 → 809.16] You will not forsake
[809.16 → 812.46] You will cheer me onward
[812.46 → 815.16] Remember I be praised
[815.16 → 818.16] Sing with joy now
[818.16 → 821.16] Our God is for us
[821.16 → 822.24] The Lord
[822.24 → 823.16] The love is
[823.16 → 825.16] The strong and mighty fortress
[825.16 → 828.16] They show us now
[828.16 → 830.16] All our strength
[830.16 → 832.16] Who can stand against us
[832.16 → 836.16] If our God is for us
[836.16 → 846.16] Neither have nor have
[846.16 → 849.16] Considerate us
[849.16 → 851.16] Head and death
[851.16 → 854.16] Will not deceive us
[854.16 → 856.16] If He did
[856.16 → 859.16] His song to free us
[859.16 → 863.16] Calls me in His love
[863.16 → 876.16] He who gave His song
[876.16 → 878.16] He who gave His song to free us
[878.16 → 884.16] Hold me in His love
[884.16 → 887.16] Sing with joy now
[887.16 → 889.16] Our God is for us
[889.16 → 891.16] The honest love
[891.16 → 894.16] Is the strong and mighty fortress
[894.16 → 897.16] Raise your voice now
[897.16 → 899.16] The love is greater
[899.16 → 901.16] Who can stand against us
[901.16 → 904.16] If our God is for us
[904.16 → 920.16] The Lord this morning with a time
[920.16 → 924.16] To bring our confessions before Him
[924.16 → 926.16] Both as a church body
[926.16 → 928.16] And individually
[928.16 → 930.16] You know the Christian life
[930.16 → 933.16] Is a life not only of repenting
[933.16 → 934.16] And turning to Christ
[934.16 → 935.16] For the first time
[935.16 → 937.16] When we become a Christian
[937.16 → 940.16] But it's a whole posture of life
[940.16 → 944.16] Not of grovelling in our sin
[944.16 → 947.16] But to honestly acknowledge our sin
[947.16 → 948.16] The brokenness of our hearts
[948.16 → 950.16] Before our loving Father
[950.16 → 951.16] And turning to Him in trust
[951.16 → 953.16] And seeking His forgiveness
[953.16 → 957.16] And so today we will have a confession
[957.16 → 959.16] That I want to invite all of us to say together
[959.16 → 961.16] And we'll have the words on our screen
[961.16 → 963.16] Let's say this prayer of confession
[963.16 → 965.16] Merciful God
[965.16 → 968.16] We confess that we have sinned against you
[968.16 → 970.16] In thought, word, and deed
[970.16 → 972.16] By what we have done
[972.16 → 974.16] And by what we have left undone
[974.16 → 977.16] We have not loved you with our whole heart
[977.16 → 978.16] And mind and strength
[978.16 → 982.16] We have not loved our neighbours as ourselves
[982.16 → 985.16] Create in us a clean heart, O God
[985.16 → 990.16] And renew a right spirit within us
[990.16 → 993.16] Friends, the Lord is steadfast, merciful
[993.16 → 995.16] And slow to anger
[995.16 → 997.16] He extends His mercy to us
[997.16 → 999.16] And receives us as we are
[999.16 → 1001.16] So let's bring our confessions
[1001.16 → 1003.16] To the Lord silently
[1003.16 → 1025.16] Father, thank you for hearing our prayers
[1025.16 → 1028.16] Through Jesus Christ, Amen
[1028.16 → 1032.16] And now also hear these words of grace
[1032.16 → 1036.16] Hear these words of favour, O children of God
[1036.16 → 1039.16] All these sins you have truly repented of
[1039.16 → 1041.16] He has eternally forgiven
[1041.16 → 1043.16] They will never be held against you
[1043.16 → 1046.16] You are free to love and to serve Him
[1046.16 → 1048.16] In joyful assurance
[1048.16 → 1052.16] Knowing His grace will always be more than sufficient
[1052.16 → 1054.16] To your own failings
[1054.16 → 1056.16] Thanks be to Christ
[1056.16 → 1059.16] For His glorious gift
[1059.16 → 1064.16] So let's sing a song of response and renewal together
[1064.16 → 1065.16] Father, O Lord
[1065.16 → 1066.16] Amen
[1066.16 → 1082.16] This is my only comfort in my life and in my days
[1082.16 → 1089.16] You have fully paid for all my sins and all my debts
[1089.16 → 1095.16] Even when I struggle to believe
[1095.16 → 1101.16] With your precious blood you set me free
[1101.16 → 1105.16] I am not my own
[1105.16 → 1108.16] But belong
[1108.16 → 1111.16] Body and soul
[1111.16 → 1117.16] In my life and in death
[1117.16 → 1119.16] Do you, Lord
[1119.16 → 1120.16] Do you, Lord
[1120.16 → 1123.16] Christ my Lord
[1123.16 → 1125.16] You preserve my life
[1125.16 → 1126.16] You serve my life
[1126.16 → 1127.16] Your sons
[1127.16 → 1129.16] You will live without me
[1129.16 → 1132.16] Not a hair can fall from me
[1132.16 → 1135.16] Unless you will return
[1135.16 → 1139.16] Even when I'm lost in desperation
[1139.16 → 1140.16] In desperation
[1140.16 → 1145.16] All things work together
[1145.16 → 1149.16] For my salvation
[1149.16 → 1152.16] I am not my own
[1152.16 → 1153.16] You must be, Lord
[1153.16 → 1155.16] Peel us up
[1155.16 → 1156.16] Lord Theo
[1156.16 → 1162.16] Crown
[1162.16 → 1171.12] And in day do you know Christ my Lord.
[1171.12 → 1188.96] Lord, with your Holy Spirit you will show me
[1188.96 → 1194.58] Of eternal life and make me willing and ready
[1194.58 → 1199.58] Even when I can't see my way through
[1199.58 → 1205.66] From now on to always be for you
[1205.66 → 1214.52] I am not my own, but be Lord
[1214.52 → 1220.46] Mighty and soul in my life
[1220.46 → 1229.52] And in day do you know Christ my Lord.
[1229.58 → 1237.66] I am not my own, but be Lord
[1237.66 → 1243.52] Mighty and soul in my life
[1243.52 → 1253.60] And in day do you know Christ my Lord.
[1253.60 → 1262.88] Good morning again friends.
[1263.68 → 1266.42] It's good again to be with you.
[1266.94 → 1268.04] Is my microphone on?
[1268.38 → 1268.76] Here we go.
[1269.46 → 1270.32] It's good to be with you again.
[1270.74 → 1271.80] Today is a good day.
[1272.08 → 1273.94] It's the Lord's day.
[1273.94 → 1279.18] We can worship Him together, which is always such a blessing.
[1279.82 → 1282.08] It's not raining, which is also great.
[1282.68 → 1283.88] And today is Super Bowl Sunday.
[1284.62 → 1287.60] So maybe later I don't know if you're going to watch the Super Bowl.
[1287.60 → 1293.44] And also right after the service we will have a time of fellowship.
[1293.62 → 1294.88] So you can join us on Zoom.
[1295.04 → 1296.54] That link was mailed out.
[1297.08 → 1300.84] And it's a time when we can just kind of catch up and see each other.
[1301.58 → 1305.28] And I was thinking about the Super Bowl and the Buccaneers are playing.
[1305.68 → 1307.08] And I have a joke about that.
[1307.08 → 1313.26] So if you join the Zoom fellowship time, I will there share my dad joke.
[1313.96 → 1315.16] So I hope to see you.
[1316.08 → 1322.04] So now we are in a series on the I Am Sayings in the Gospel of John.
[1322.40 → 1325.94] It's where Jesus is telling us about who He really is.
[1326.26 → 1327.76] So that we can know Him.
[1328.14 → 1329.60] So that we can believe in Him.
[1330.14 → 1333.32] And in knowing and believing, have life eternal.
[1333.32 → 1337.38] And so let's turn our attention to our scripture reading this morning.
[1337.60 → 1342.08] We are going to be reading John chapter 14, verses 1 through 6.
[1342.46 → 1344.98] We have the words here up on our screen.
[1346.82 → 1349.10] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[1350.18 → 1351.32] You believe in God.
[1352.10 → 1353.62] Believe also in me.
[1354.62 → 1356.44] My Father's house has many rooms.
[1356.56 → 1362.24] If that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
[1362.24 → 1367.44] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me,
[1367.80 → 1370.76] that you also may be where I am.
[1371.38 → 1374.64] You know the way to the place where I am going.
[1376.18 → 1377.30] Thomas said to Him,
[1377.94 → 1382.24] Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?
[1383.62 → 1384.62] Jesus answered,
[1384.62 → 1396.66] This is the word of the Lord.
[1397.20 → 1402.52] Let's come before the Lord again together in prayer as we look at this passage together.
[1402.62 → 1402.98] Let's pray.
[1402.98 → 1410.48] Father, we come before you again seeking your words of life.
[1412.10 → 1414.80] Lord, would you speak life into our hearts.
[1415.80 → 1420.98] Just like the disciples, our hearts are troubled by many things.
[1420.98 → 1425.90] And Lord, help us to turn to you and trust in you this morning.
[1426.74 → 1430.02] And would you comfort us with your truth and who you are.
[1430.96 → 1434.98] We pray for your Spirit's help in each one of us.
[1435.52 → 1439.24] We thank you that wherever we are, we don't have to be gathered here in one place.
[1439.54 → 1441.52] But that wherever we are, you are there.
[1442.28 → 1444.82] And wherever you are there, we are with you.
[1445.48 → 1447.28] And so we praise you, and thank you for that.
[1447.98 → 1449.08] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1449.54 → 1449.84] Amen.
[1449.84 → 1449.96] Amen.
[1450.92 → 1455.08] So today we're talking about the topic of home.
[1456.08 → 1458.42] It's really this passage is about our home.
[1459.72 → 1462.08] And, you know, I was thinking about this idea of home.
[1462.24 → 1463.38] And, you know, I was thinking about kids.
[1463.48 → 1467.06] Well, kids often miss home when they are away from home.
[1467.52 → 1467.70] Right?
[1467.76 → 1469.38] They get homesick.
[1470.70 → 1473.88] You know, when I was in elementary school,
[1474.10 → 1477.06] I would have a few chances to go to a summer camp.
[1477.12 → 1478.06] It was a Christian summer camp.
[1478.06 → 1482.10] And the first time I went, I went with a perfect friend of mine.
[1482.18 → 1482.92] We went together.
[1483.94 → 1486.28] And, you know, our parents dropped us off.
[1486.56 → 1488.60] And so my parents dropped me off and left.
[1488.76 → 1490.30] And I was feeling pretty brave.
[1490.38 → 1491.24] I was okay with that.
[1491.24 → 1499.30] And so my friend, not to throw him under the bus, but he was not having it.
[1499.40 → 1500.28] He would not go.
[1500.28 → 1507.62] He, you know, sat in the parking lot after his parents left, so upset that his parents had left him.
[1508.20 → 1510.58] He was homesick, and it hadn't even been a minute.
[1512.14 → 1520.62] You know, sometimes when you live in another country, even after many years and even after trying your best to make a home there,
[1520.62 → 1524.44] there's always a sense in which you're never really home.
[1525.52 → 1529.28] Many of us who are immigrants can experience that.
[1529.28 → 1537.18] But I think this feeling of home is actually not even so much a place as it is a person.
[1538.24 → 1544.86] It's being with the one you love is really what we often mean by being home.
[1545.56 → 1549.22] There's a great song I thought of this week as I was preparing this passage.
[1549.22 → 1553.12] It's by a band called Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros.
[1553.12 → 1554.52] And it's a song called Home.
[1555.02 → 1557.86] So I want to just share a few of the lyrics with you.
[1557.96 → 1558.56] They're on the screen.
[1560.64 → 1561.66] It's really catchy.
[1561.78 → 1562.56] I'm not going to sing.
[1562.84 → 1566.08] But Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my ma and pa.
[1566.58 → 1569.16] Not that way that I do love you.
[1570.18 → 1573.66] Well, holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye.
[1574.22 → 1576.80] Girl, I've never loved one like you.
[1577.92 → 1578.96] And then here's the chorus.
[1579.60 → 1581.56] Oh, home, let me come home.
[1581.56 → 1585.14] Home is wherever I'm with you.
[1588.34 → 1590.68] And it's a really lighthearted song.
[1590.78 → 1591.54] It's a love song.
[1591.68 → 1594.90] And it's talking about being with the one you love, right?
[1595.54 → 1598.68] And in the same way, that's really what this passage is about.
[1598.78 → 1601.38] It's about being with the one you love.
[1602.26 → 1606.02] It's about how our true home, the home that we were created for,
[1606.02 → 1612.36] the home that we were exiled from because of our disobedience to God,
[1612.68 → 1616.28] this home that we all long to return to,
[1616.40 → 1620.44] that we have this longing for home deep inside of us.
[1620.44 → 1627.52] It's actually a longing to be at home with our Heavenly Father once again.
[1628.62 → 1631.74] And in today's passage, Jesus is talking to his disciples.
[1632.06 → 1634.94] And he's not talking here to everyone.
[1635.36 → 1637.96] In other times, other passages we've looked at,
[1638.02 → 1641.16] he's talking to the Pharisees, or he's talking to the crowds.
[1641.16 → 1645.28] But here, he's talking to his loved ones,
[1645.84 → 1648.88] the ones who have been with him for three years.
[1649.00 → 1651.04] And so here in chapter 13,
[1651.34 → 1654.22] it's the start of what is called the Upper Room Discourse,
[1654.32 → 1656.18] where Jesus is gathered with his disciples.
[1657.14 → 1660.30] It is the night when Jesus washes their feet
[1660.30 → 1661.82] and they celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[1663.64 → 1667.80] But I wonder if you can imagine what it must have been like
[1667.80 → 1670.64] to have been with Jesus for three years.
[1671.16 → 1671.60] Right?
[1672.40 → 1678.12] They saw Jesus publicly turning water into wine at a party.
[1678.46 → 1679.42] That must have been amazing.
[1680.10 → 1681.90] They saw him feeding crowds,
[1682.02 → 1685.32] thousands and thousands of people with just a few loaves and fish.
[1687.10 → 1689.52] They saw him heal people.
[1691.40 → 1696.68] They saw him teach the crowds about God and the kingdom.
[1697.42 → 1700.88] But not only that, they also had more intimate times with Jesus.
[1701.16 → 1704.52] They walked with him on the road.
[1705.24 → 1706.36] You know, just a few of them.
[1707.30 → 1709.44] They ate meals with Jesus.
[1710.12 → 1716.50] They shared friendship and laughter and embrace with him.
[1716.50 → 1724.30] It must have been an unbelievable experience for them to be with Jesus like that.
[1725.34 → 1729.20] But now they are mere days away from Jesus' death.
[1729.20 → 1737.16] And Jesus has begun to talk to them and tell them things that are deeply troubling for them.
[1737.66 → 1742.30] He has spoken to them about his departure, that he would be crucified.
[1742.30 → 1752.90] And he's mentioned right before this chapter, earlier in chapter 13, how Judas, one who had been with them all of these years,
[1753.34 → 1754.52] will betray them.
[1754.52 → 1760.62] He's spoken about how Peter, one who is so confident in his own ability to follow Jesus,
[1761.14 → 1763.96] how Peter himself will deny Jesus.
[1763.96 → 1771.54] And because of all these things, and probably more than this also, the disciples have troubled hearts.
[1772.56 → 1777.40] The passage opens with the disciples not being okay at all.
[1778.44 → 1783.14] Jesus has to tell them, don't let your hearts be troubled, because in fact they were troubled.
[1783.14 → 1792.36] They were probably confused and hurt and sad and anxious and upset and probably more emotions than these.
[1793.30 → 1796.00] They were uncertain about where Jesus is going.
[1796.60 → 1799.94] They don't understand why they can't follow him.
[1801.16 → 1805.82] And it's in this context where Jesus answers them.
[1805.94 → 1807.20] Jesus tries to comfort them.
[1807.76 → 1812.62] Jesus is going to give them some answers about why, in the midst of everything that seems to be falling apart,
[1812.62 → 1815.86] why they should not be troubled.
[1817.00 → 1822.28] And what Jesus does for them is what he does for all of his people.
[1822.42 → 1825.14] He soothes our troubled hearts.
[1826.38 → 1831.30] And so I want to put it to us this morning that Jesus' response to the disciples,
[1831.30 → 1837.44] even though, you know, some of our troubles and our questions may be different from theirs,
[1838.14 → 1841.98] his response to them holds true for us as well.
[1842.62 → 1848.08] And it's actually the answer to our troubles that we go through, no matter what they are.
[1849.30 → 1851.80] So, two things I want to look at this morning.
[1852.74 → 1855.04] First, how do we deal with a troubled heart?
[1856.32 → 1863.78] And second, we're going to see four things that Jesus tells us that he wants us to believe in and trust him.
[1863.78 → 1870.32] And they're all about what it means that we do have a home with Jesus always.
[1870.74 → 1873.10] So, let's look at those two things together this morning.
[1873.20 → 1877.58] The first one is how to deal with our troubled hearts.
[1878.42 → 1883.72] Okay, so as we've said, right in verse one, we see how to deal with our troubled hearts.
[1883.72 → 1890.46] And Jesus says to his disciples very plainly, do not let your hearts be troubled.
[1892.36 → 1897.24] Now, I know for all of us, you know, if we had the chance to talk together,
[1898.18 → 1904.90] you would be able to very quickly tell me what kind of trouble you have and how your heart might be troubled.
[1904.90 → 1910.98] We all have troubles of all kinds of different troubles.
[1911.88 → 1919.62] And it's interesting, though, how Jesus makes a distinction between facing trouble and letting our hearts be troubled.
[1920.70 → 1924.14] Okay, this is one of the biggest problems that we often face,
[1924.20 → 1927.84] that we fail to see the distinction between our circumstances,
[1927.84 → 1931.24] truly troubling things that we go through,
[1931.80 → 1935.48] and how to respond to those circumstances.
[1936.42 → 1941.64] And so here Jesus says, do not let your hearts be troubled.
[1942.22 → 1945.24] Right, he doesn't say there is no trouble.
[1946.02 → 1948.20] He doesn't say anything's going to go wrong.
[1948.48 → 1952.56] He doesn't say if you're a Christian, you won't have any more troubles for the rest of your life.
[1953.22 → 1955.02] He doesn't say any of that.
[1955.02 → 1958.82] In fact, later on in John chapter 16, Jesus says,
[1959.04 → 1962.94] in this world you will have trouble, but take heart.
[1963.96 → 1964.78] Take heart.
[1965.12 → 1967.08] I have overcome the world.
[1968.42 → 1974.40] And so many of us make the mistake in our troubles of trying to change our circumstances.
[1975.20 → 1978.00] Right, and we think that this is how we deal with our troubles.
[1978.12 → 1979.66] Well, we just need to fix what's wrong.
[1979.66 → 1983.00] Now, if we are very resourceful,
[1983.54 → 1986.98] or if our troubles are small enough,
[1987.38 → 1990.62] it might be possible for us to change our circumstances.
[1991.50 → 1996.70] But there's plenty in life where we can't change our circumstances.
[1996.92 → 2002.48] There's so much in life where it's not in our control to change at all.
[2002.48 → 2007.88] And troubles are there not so that we can change our circumstances,
[2008.54 → 2012.92] but often in the Bible we see God's purpose in them.
[2013.16 → 2016.44] God's purpose is to actually change us.
[2016.86 → 2019.36] That our hearts would be changed.
[2019.80 → 2022.72] You know, they've done surveys of Christians and asked,
[2022.72 → 2027.00] what is it in life that has helped you grow the most as a Christian?
[2027.72 → 2030.58] And the answer is not sermons.
[2031.86 → 2035.38] The answer is not inspiring praise music.
[2035.82 → 2037.10] It's not mission trips.
[2037.40 → 2038.52] It's not Sunday school.
[2038.64 → 2039.72] It's not all these things.
[2040.08 → 2045.16] The thing that most helps us grow in the Christian life is trouble.
[2045.60 → 2051.02] It's trials that we have to face that causes us to change in the trust in God.
[2051.02 → 2057.54] And when we realize that we don't have to change our circumstances
[2057.54 → 2060.24] for our hearts to be at rest,
[2060.74 → 2063.54] then we can begin to come to Jesus.
[2064.46 → 2066.18] And that's what Jesus says here.
[2066.56 → 2067.82] In the midst of their troubles,
[2067.94 → 2070.96] he invites the disciples to believe in him.
[2071.56 → 2073.40] He says, do not let your hearts be troubled.
[2074.26 → 2075.54] You believe in God.
[2076.24 → 2077.78] Believe also in me.
[2079.18 → 2080.86] Now, I want to pause right there.
[2081.88 → 2085.56] Because to say, just believe in Jesus,
[2086.48 → 2089.84] can sound really unhelpful, at least on the surface.
[2089.98 → 2091.94] You know, and this is something we've talked about a bit
[2091.94 → 2094.50] in our cross-training class on anxiety.
[2096.28 → 2100.26] You know, and the reason, though, that this is unhelpful
[2100.26 → 2102.90] is that in some corners of Christianity,
[2103.92 → 2105.30] and you can find this anywhere,
[2105.48 → 2107.96] not picking on any one church,
[2107.96 → 2110.72] but when someone expresses doubt
[2110.72 → 2113.24] or questions about Christianity,
[2113.62 → 2115.44] often what is quickly said is,
[2115.62 → 2116.90] well, you just need to believe.
[2118.92 → 2120.36] Or, excuse me,
[2120.44 → 2122.72] or if you're struggling with anxiety,
[2123.60 → 2124.84] some people might say,
[2124.94 → 2126.72] well, just have more faith.
[2127.14 → 2128.10] And you're like, well,
[2128.18 → 2131.00] if I could just stop being anxious,
[2131.24 → 2131.76] I would.
[2131.76 → 2133.50] If I could just turn it on and off,
[2133.64 → 2134.80] that would be great.
[2135.74 → 2137.64] So just saying, believe in Jesus,
[2138.20 → 2141.70] is rarely helpful or healthy.
[2143.42 → 2144.28] But friends,
[2144.40 → 2147.10] this kind of dismissal
[2147.10 → 2149.82] that we're maybe kind of used to hearing,
[2150.22 → 2151.40] that we're afraid of,
[2151.62 → 2154.74] is really not the sense of Jesus' words here.
[2154.74 → 2158.72] Jesus doesn't ignore their questions.
[2159.06 → 2161.92] He doesn't ignore the troubled heart
[2161.92 → 2163.04] that they are experiencing.
[2163.36 → 2165.16] He's actually about to answer them.
[2165.56 → 2167.64] He's going to give them all kinds of reasons
[2167.64 → 2170.44] that they should believe in him.
[2171.26 → 2171.50] Right?
[2171.54 → 2173.22] He doesn't say just believe.
[2173.80 → 2175.40] He wants them to know something
[2175.40 → 2176.64] and trust something
[2176.64 → 2178.22] and to believe in something.
[2178.64 → 2180.88] So that even in the midst of things going wrong,
[2180.98 → 2183.06] there is something that they can know is true.
[2183.06 → 2185.56] There can be an anchor for their souls
[2185.56 → 2187.78] no matter what they're going through.
[2187.90 → 2190.02] Something that can bring them
[2190.02 → 2192.28] certainty and security.
[2193.78 → 2196.36] So why does he say, believe in me?
[2197.06 → 2198.86] It's because he knows that
[2198.86 → 2201.06] putting their trust in him
[2201.06 → 2204.00] is ultimately what they need.
[2205.14 → 2205.40] Right?
[2205.44 → 2207.10] Let's not miss that the cure
[2207.10 → 2209.70] for a troubled heart is Jesus.
[2210.86 → 2211.08] Right?
[2211.08 → 2213.48] And so the way we deal with our anxieties,
[2213.92 → 2215.54] our worries, our fears,
[2215.82 → 2217.24] confusions, and questions
[2217.24 → 2220.12] is not to run away from Jesus
[2220.12 → 2222.56] but to run toward him.
[2223.48 → 2223.90] Right?
[2223.98 → 2225.56] We approach him
[2225.56 → 2227.34] with all the troubles of our heart
[2227.34 → 2229.38] and ask him for help.
[2229.48 → 2230.48] You know, sometimes we think
[2230.48 → 2231.32] in the Christian life,
[2231.42 → 2233.20] well, if I'm anxious
[2233.20 → 2234.00] or I have troubles,
[2234.12 → 2235.08] well, maybe what I need
[2235.08 → 2237.16] is just kind of a break from church
[2237.16 → 2239.00] or a break from reading our Bibles
[2239.00 → 2241.06] and that is the furthest from the truth.
[2241.98 → 2243.90] It's no good to pretend we're fine
[2243.90 → 2244.96] if we're not fine.
[2245.36 → 2247.36] And Jesus invites us to go to him
[2247.36 → 2249.26] even with our troubles,
[2249.46 → 2251.22] even with our questions and doubts,
[2251.40 → 2253.08] to be honest with him.
[2254.20 → 2256.32] And so we come to Jesus with our troubles.
[2256.32 → 2258.34] And friends,
[2258.38 → 2260.12] that's what Christianity is all about.
[2260.74 → 2260.98] Right?
[2261.04 → 2262.06] It's putting our trust
[2262.06 → 2264.36] in or on Jesus Christ
[2264.36 → 2266.28] and not on some other thing
[2266.28 → 2267.18] that we think
[2267.18 → 2268.64] will give us
[2268.64 → 2270.08] that security we're looking for.
[2270.80 → 2271.90] Jesus is the one
[2271.90 → 2272.72] we believe in
[2272.72 → 2273.54] and trust in
[2273.54 → 2274.44] and live in.
[2276.02 → 2277.82] So let me just ask you this morning,
[2278.32 → 2280.46] what is it that you trust in?
[2281.46 → 2281.72] Right?
[2281.72 → 2284.24] What do you believe in?
[2285.86 → 2287.16] One way to consider
[2287.16 → 2289.56] what you put your confidence in
[2289.56 → 2290.60] is to ask this question.
[2291.72 → 2294.42] If everything was to go wrong,
[2294.80 → 2296.54] what's the one thing you could say,
[2296.86 → 2298.88] well, at least I have this.
[2300.08 → 2300.30] Right?
[2300.36 → 2302.24] So if I do lose my health
[2302.24 → 2304.56] or my relationship
[2304.56 → 2306.12] or my job,
[2306.70 → 2307.52] you can say,
[2307.64 → 2308.74] I have this,
[2308.94 → 2310.04] so I'll be okay.
[2310.04 → 2312.54] And often that thing
[2312.54 → 2313.20] that we say,
[2313.28 → 2315.64] at least I have this,
[2316.36 → 2318.16] is often the thing
[2318.16 → 2319.26] that we are treasuring
[2319.26 → 2320.92] and putting our hope in.
[2321.74 → 2323.66] And Jesus wants us to turn
[2323.66 → 2325.48] from trusting in that,
[2325.56 → 2326.82] whether it's our bank account,
[2327.34 → 2330.40] whether it's a relationship we have,
[2330.94 → 2332.14] whatever it is,
[2332.26 → 2334.78] to turn from trusting in that thing
[2334.78 → 2336.14] as the anchor of our souls
[2336.14 → 2337.36] and to instead turn
[2337.36 → 2338.44] and believe in him.
[2338.44 → 2339.54] We're going to believe in something
[2339.54 → 2341.48] so it's not a problem of belief,
[2341.58 → 2342.54] it's a problem of
[2342.54 → 2344.38] what is the object of our belief.
[2348.38 → 2349.60] And so that is what Jesus
[2349.60 → 2350.54] is calling us to.
[2350.86 → 2351.20] And so,
[2351.64 → 2352.36] and that brings us
[2352.36 → 2353.70] to the second point this morning.
[2355.24 → 2356.40] What is it that Jesus
[2356.40 → 2357.26] wants us to believe?
[2358.54 → 2360.64] What does he want us to trust in
[2360.64 → 2362.88] that is going to soothe our hearts?
[2362.88 → 2365.34] And so we see,
[2365.78 → 2366.18] I think,
[2366.26 → 2367.46] four different things
[2367.46 → 2369.62] here that he wants us
[2369.62 → 2370.40] to believe in
[2370.40 → 2371.94] and put our trust in.
[2372.94 → 2373.18] Okay,
[2373.22 → 2374.10] so we're going to look at,
[2374.28 → 2375.24] kind of go through this passage
[2375.24 → 2376.64] and look at a couple of these things.
[2377.18 → 2378.04] So the first thing
[2378.04 → 2379.38] Jesus wants us to believe
[2379.38 → 2381.84] is that we have a home
[2381.84 → 2382.88] with God,
[2382.98 → 2383.64] our Father.
[2384.52 → 2386.16] So he says in verse 2,
[2386.82 → 2387.88] he begins to say,
[2387.88 → 2389.96] my Father's house
[2389.96 → 2391.06] has many rooms.
[2391.86 → 2392.94] So Jesus begins
[2392.94 → 2393.80] to tell his disciples
[2393.80 → 2394.90] where he is going.
[2395.84 → 2397.32] And he says he's going
[2397.32 → 2399.54] to his Father's house.
[2400.26 → 2400.64] Now,
[2400.82 → 2402.18] what is this place?
[2402.30 → 2403.88] What is the Father's house?
[2404.74 → 2405.56] And the answer is,
[2405.64 → 2407.10] Jesus is talking about heaven.
[2408.70 → 2410.12] And so we need to understand
[2410.12 → 2410.68] this a bit.
[2411.10 → 2412.10] Because in the Bible,
[2412.38 → 2413.74] the ideas of heaven
[2413.74 → 2414.56] and earth
[2414.56 → 2417.30] are ways of talking about
[2417.30 → 2419.06] heaven as God's space
[2419.06 → 2422.12] and earth as our space.
[2422.24 → 2423.42] So where God lives
[2423.42 → 2424.76] and where we live.
[2425.40 → 2425.72] Now,
[2425.80 → 2427.06] we know about our space.
[2427.20 → 2427.32] You know,
[2427.38 → 2428.14] we live here.
[2428.88 → 2429.28] Earth.
[2429.60 → 2431.10] We have trees and mountains,
[2431.84 → 2432.14] rivers,
[2432.70 → 2434.06] and animals.
[2435.02 → 2436.36] But we don't know much
[2436.36 → 2436.90] about heaven.
[2437.62 → 2437.98] Heaven,
[2438.32 → 2438.68] for me,
[2438.76 → 2440.48] I think is quite confusing.
[2441.78 → 2442.74] And the reason is
[2442.74 → 2443.78] because the Bible actually
[2443.78 → 2445.12] doesn't tell us much about it.
[2446.02 → 2447.06] The Apostle Paul
[2447.06 → 2449.10] had a vision of heaven,
[2449.88 → 2451.02] but whether it was
[2451.02 → 2451.70] because it was
[2451.70 → 2453.40] so indescribable
[2453.40 → 2455.10] or for some other reason,
[2456.00 → 2457.30] he doesn't talk about it.
[2458.04 → 2459.02] And God gave him
[2459.02 → 2460.20] this thorn in the flesh
[2460.20 → 2462.00] to keep him humble.
[2463.24 → 2463.92] So here,
[2464.04 → 2465.32] Jesus is giving us,
[2465.68 → 2466.76] and we find many
[2466.76 → 2467.70] kind of metaphors
[2467.70 → 2468.34] and images
[2468.34 → 2469.14] that give us
[2469.14 → 2470.12] these pictures of heaven
[2470.12 → 2470.72] in the Bible.
[2470.84 → 2471.24] And here,
[2471.50 → 2472.36] we have one of these
[2472.36 → 2472.92] metaphors.
[2473.72 → 2474.56] He's talking
[2474.56 → 2475.84] about heaven,
[2475.96 → 2476.64] and he's talking
[2476.64 → 2477.74] about it as
[2477.74 → 2478.70] the Father's house.
[2480.16 → 2480.72] And so,
[2480.86 → 2482.04] he doesn't mean
[2482.04 → 2482.88] kind of like
[2482.88 → 2484.22] what we may have learned
[2484.22 → 2485.08] in Sunday school
[2485.08 → 2486.08] where we have these
[2486.08 → 2487.06] drawings
[2487.06 → 2487.98] or posters
[2487.98 → 2489.66] where heaven
[2489.66 → 2491.36] is this big mansion
[2491.36 → 2492.28] in the sky.
[2493.56 → 2494.88] He's not talking
[2494.88 → 2495.80] about that.
[2496.18 → 2497.36] He's simply saying
[2497.36 → 2498.78] that there is a place
[2498.78 → 2500.34] where God dwells
[2500.34 → 2500.90] eternally.
[2502.54 → 2503.92] And he says,
[2504.52 → 2505.74] my Father's house
[2505.74 → 2507.04] has many rooms.
[2507.54 → 2508.62] And that word rooms
[2508.62 → 2510.14] is used only one other time
[2510.14 → 2511.12] in the entire New Testament,
[2511.46 → 2512.22] and it's used here
[2512.22 → 2512.98] in the same chapter,
[2513.10 → 2513.74] John 14,
[2514.48 → 2515.70] further on in verse 23,
[2516.20 → 2517.42] where Jesus says,
[2518.10 → 2519.12] if anyone loves me,
[2519.26 → 2520.46] he will keep my word,
[2520.90 → 2522.54] and my Father will love him.
[2522.78 → 2523.24] And listen,
[2524.20 → 2524.52] he,
[2524.90 → 2525.20] or we,
[2525.30 → 2526.30] that is Jesus in God,
[2526.36 → 2527.90] will come to him
[2527.90 → 2530.14] and make our home
[2530.14 → 2530.82] with him.
[2530.88 → 2531.60] The word home
[2531.60 → 2532.56] and room is the same.
[2533.04 → 2533.64] He will come
[2533.64 → 2534.82] and make his home
[2534.82 → 2535.24] with him.
[2535.96 → 2537.22] So we see here
[2537.22 → 2538.66] that Jesus
[2538.66 → 2539.46] is not talking
[2539.46 → 2540.44] about going
[2540.44 → 2541.46] somewhere else.
[2542.16 → 2542.92] Jesus is talking
[2542.92 → 2543.46] about God
[2543.46 → 2544.46] coming and making
[2544.46 → 2545.24] his home
[2545.24 → 2546.50] with us.
[2547.54 → 2548.28] And so when we
[2548.28 → 2549.30] understand the metaphor,
[2549.54 → 2550.00] we should think
[2550.00 → 2550.60] not so much
[2550.60 → 2552.08] of rooms
[2552.08 → 2553.16] and some house
[2553.16 → 2554.18] that God has,
[2554.54 → 2555.66] but of this amazing
[2555.66 → 2557.10] privilege of dwelling
[2557.10 → 2558.34] in God's presence.
[2558.84 → 2559.90] Basically of having
[2559.90 → 2560.70] a home
[2560.70 → 2561.96] with God
[2561.96 → 2562.90] as our Heavenly Father.
[2564.60 → 2564.90] You know,
[2564.94 → 2565.84] the Bible talks
[2565.84 → 2566.64] about God
[2566.64 → 2568.22] as being
[2568.22 → 2569.24] our Father.
[2570.16 → 2570.40] Right?
[2570.54 → 2571.36] The Bible talks
[2571.36 → 2571.94] about God
[2571.94 → 2573.52] as a perfect Father.
[2574.20 → 2575.60] A Father who cares
[2575.60 → 2576.20] for us
[2576.20 → 2577.44] and provides
[2577.44 → 2577.88] for us
[2577.88 → 2578.64] as his children.
[2579.20 → 2579.80] He's the Father
[2579.80 → 2580.72] who leads us
[2580.72 → 2581.80] and protects us
[2581.80 → 2582.66] who guides
[2582.66 → 2583.68] and teaches us
[2583.68 → 2585.18] and who loves us.
[2586.82 → 2587.78] And so if you
[2587.78 → 2588.54] are feeling
[2588.54 → 2589.10] troubled
[2589.10 → 2589.96] at this moment,
[2590.14 → 2590.46] friends,
[2591.16 → 2591.82] you should know
[2591.82 → 2592.70] that you have
[2592.70 → 2593.38] a home
[2593.38 → 2594.46] with a loving
[2594.46 → 2595.04] Father
[2595.04 → 2596.48] who made you
[2596.48 → 2597.44] and who loves you.
[2600.42 → 2601.46] Now the second
[2601.46 → 2602.08] thing Jesus
[2602.08 → 2603.28] wants us to believe
[2603.28 → 2604.60] is that
[2604.60 → 2605.82] the Father's house
[2605.82 → 2606.52] has a place
[2606.52 → 2607.22] for all of
[2607.22 → 2608.08] Jesus' disciples.
[2608.90 → 2609.38] Jesus says,
[2609.38 → 2610.24] I'm going there
[2610.24 → 2610.90] to prepare
[2610.90 → 2611.94] a place
[2611.94 → 2612.98] for you.
[2613.88 → 2614.56] And the word
[2614.56 → 2615.58] Jesus uses
[2615.58 → 2616.38] for place
[2616.38 → 2617.34] suggests
[2617.34 → 2618.14] something
[2618.14 → 2619.14] concrete,
[2619.76 → 2620.64] something real
[2620.64 → 2621.74] and lasting.
[2622.24 → 2623.42] He's talking about,
[2623.56 → 2624.32] it's a word
[2624.32 → 2624.94] that refers
[2624.94 → 2626.40] to a permanent dwelling,
[2626.76 → 2627.52] not something
[2627.52 → 2628.16] transient,
[2628.70 → 2629.36] not something
[2629.36 → 2630.32] that can be
[2630.32 → 2630.88] taken away
[2630.88 → 2631.46] from us.
[2632.68 → 2634.16] So Jesus says,
[2634.80 → 2635.60] there is
[2635.60 → 2636.48] a place
[2636.48 → 2637.06] for you.
[2637.66 → 2638.44] Jesus is talking
[2638.44 → 2639.36] to his disciples
[2639.36 → 2640.04] and he's saying
[2640.04 → 2640.52] to them,
[2640.96 → 2641.70] there is a place
[2641.70 → 2642.84] for all of you
[2642.84 → 2643.64] to come.
[2644.42 → 2645.10] It's not
[2645.10 → 2645.96] first come,
[2646.08 → 2646.76] first serve.
[2647.08 → 2647.88] It's not like
[2647.88 → 2648.68] there's vacancy
[2648.68 → 2649.90] and then no vacancy.
[2650.58 → 2651.28] It's not like
[2651.28 → 2651.74] the inn
[2651.74 → 2653.02] that Mary and Joseph
[2653.02 → 2654.02] tried to get into
[2654.02 → 2655.04] where there was
[2655.04 → 2655.90] no space.
[2656.94 → 2658.42] There is space
[2658.42 → 2659.54] for everyone.
[2661.00 → 2661.78] And so to these
[2661.78 → 2663.12] unsure disciples
[2663.12 → 2664.00] who fear
[2664.00 → 2664.56] that everything
[2664.56 → 2665.06] that they have
[2665.06 → 2665.86] staked their lives
[2665.86 → 2666.34] on for these
[2666.34 → 2667.28] past three years
[2667.28 → 2668.66] living with Jesus
[2668.66 → 2669.64] and following Jesus
[2669.64 → 2671.02] is for nothing,
[2671.92 → 2672.64] to them
[2672.64 → 2673.54] he assures them
[2673.54 → 2674.28] that they have
[2674.28 → 2674.76] something
[2674.76 → 2676.56] that is unshakeable,
[2677.46 → 2679.18] that cannot be lost,
[2679.26 → 2680.40] that cannot be broken.
[2681.20 → 2682.44] There is a place
[2682.44 → 2683.38] for you
[2683.38 → 2685.26] in the Father's house.
[2686.00 → 2686.80] And he tells them
[2686.80 → 2687.84] that God wants
[2687.84 → 2689.20] to dwell with you.
[2689.32 → 2690.06] God wants you
[2690.06 → 2690.80] to be there
[2690.80 → 2691.90] with him.
[2692.30 → 2692.98] There's a place
[2692.98 → 2693.36] for you.
[2693.36 → 2696.02] Okay, so
[2696.02 → 2697.64] Jesus is telling us
[2697.64 → 2698.08] these things
[2698.08 → 2698.74] we are to believe
[2698.74 → 2699.22] that there
[2699.22 → 2701.14] is a Father's house,
[2701.68 → 2702.40] that there is
[2702.40 → 2703.06] a Father
[2703.06 → 2703.60] that we can have
[2703.60 → 2704.28] a relationship
[2704.28 → 2705.08] with,
[2705.50 → 2706.12] that where
[2706.12 → 2707.20] our true home is,
[2707.32 → 2707.90] and that there's
[2707.90 → 2708.84] a place for all
[2708.84 → 2709.76] of Jesus' followers.
[2711.18 → 2712.16] Now the issue
[2712.16 → 2712.94] or the question,
[2713.20 → 2713.72] and this is the
[2713.72 → 2714.30] third point,
[2715.46 → 2716.84] is will we be able
[2716.84 → 2717.50] to get there?
[2719.14 → 2720.30] This is the third thing
[2720.30 → 2721.04] Jesus wants us
[2721.04 → 2721.42] to believe
[2721.42 → 2722.36] that he is going
[2722.36 → 2724.06] to prepare the way
[2724.06 → 2725.50] for his disciples.
[2726.02 → 2726.84] So he says,
[2727.28 → 2728.26] I am going there
[2728.26 → 2729.42] to prepare
[2729.42 → 2731.04] a place for you.
[2733.00 → 2734.38] Now when we read
[2734.38 → 2735.68] that Jesus is going
[2735.68 → 2736.62] to heaven
[2736.62 → 2738.46] to prepare a place,
[2738.92 → 2739.94] what do you think of?
[2740.98 → 2742.60] Well what often,
[2742.84 → 2743.66] kind of growing up,
[2743.76 → 2744.98] first came to my mind
[2744.98 → 2746.06] was that Jesus
[2746.06 → 2746.86] has gone to heaven
[2746.86 → 2747.68] and he is now
[2747.68 → 2749.36] using his carpentry skills.
[2749.36 → 2750.72] That he has learned
[2750.72 → 2751.14] on earth
[2751.14 → 2751.86] from his Father
[2751.86 → 2753.24] as a young man
[2753.24 → 2754.46] and that he is now
[2754.46 → 2755.60] building rooms
[2755.60 → 2756.28] in heaven
[2756.28 → 2757.22] for his disciples
[2757.22 → 2757.80] to occupy.
[2758.64 → 2759.24] And that maybe
[2759.24 → 2760.32] he hasn't come back yet
[2760.32 → 2761.22] for the reason that
[2761.22 → 2762.36] he's still at work,
[2762.44 → 2763.06] he's still building
[2763.06 → 2763.74] all of these rooms
[2763.74 → 2764.24] for us.
[2765.64 → 2767.22] Is that what Jesus means?
[2768.70 → 2769.14] No,
[2769.22 → 2770.18] I don't think it is.
[2771.20 → 2772.06] Jesus says,
[2772.70 → 2773.36] I go
[2773.36 → 2774.60] and prepare
[2774.60 → 2775.44] a place for you.
[2776.10 → 2776.30] Okay,
[2776.34 → 2776.88] I go
[2776.88 → 2777.32] and prepare
[2777.32 → 2778.08] a place for you.
[2778.08 → 2779.42] And in John's gospel,
[2779.60 → 2780.22] this idea
[2780.22 → 2780.78] of Jesus
[2780.78 → 2782.62] going or departing
[2782.62 → 2783.70] is spoken of
[2783.70 → 2784.72] many times
[2784.72 → 2785.68] and in every
[2785.68 → 2786.58] single instance
[2786.58 → 2787.66] it's a reference
[2787.66 → 2788.44] to the cross.
[2790.02 → 2791.48] So what this means
[2791.48 → 2793.16] is his going away,
[2793.36 → 2794.12] which refers to
[2794.12 → 2795.10] his going to die
[2795.10 → 2795.78] on the cross,
[2796.42 → 2797.86] is his preparing
[2797.86 → 2798.66] the way.
[2799.36 → 2800.12] By his death
[2800.12 → 2800.80] on the cross,
[2800.94 → 2801.70] Jesus prepares
[2801.70 → 2802.68] a place for us
[2802.68 → 2803.44] with the Father.
[2803.84 → 2804.58] That's how
[2804.58 → 2805.54] we can be
[2805.54 → 2806.16] with God
[2806.16 → 2806.84] and how God
[2806.84 → 2807.62] can be
[2807.62 → 2808.62] with us
[2808.62 → 2809.28] because of this
[2809.28 → 2810.56] way that Jesus
[2810.56 → 2811.52] has prepared.
[2812.56 → 2813.42] So Jesus'
[2813.66 → 2814.18] disciples
[2814.18 → 2816.16] are sad
[2816.16 → 2817.66] and uncertain
[2817.66 → 2819.04] because Jesus
[2819.04 → 2820.32] is going away.
[2820.90 → 2821.76] And to comfort
[2821.76 → 2822.24] them,
[2822.50 → 2823.26] Jesus says,
[2823.38 → 2823.52] look,
[2823.58 → 2824.40] it is better
[2824.40 → 2825.16] that I go
[2825.16 → 2826.06] because in my
[2826.06 → 2826.56] going,
[2827.12 → 2828.06] in my death
[2828.06 → 2828.78] and resurrection,
[2828.78 → 2830.00] I am going
[2830.00 → 2831.06] to make a way
[2831.06 → 2831.50] for you
[2831.50 → 2832.72] to be with me
[2832.72 → 2833.54] forever.
[2834.58 → 2835.26] Right now,
[2835.34 → 2836.08] you can't get
[2836.08 → 2836.92] to where I am
[2836.92 → 2837.28] going,
[2837.68 → 2838.78] but if I go,
[2838.88 → 2839.70] I will make a way
[2839.70 → 2840.36] for you
[2840.36 → 2841.42] that you will
[2841.42 → 2842.08] be with me
[2842.08 → 2842.44] always.
[2843.80 → 2844.98] So in saying
[2844.98 → 2845.24] this,
[2845.28 → 2846.06] he's trying to
[2846.06 → 2846.68] comfort them
[2846.68 → 2846.96] and say,
[2847.06 → 2847.80] I'm going,
[2848.38 → 2849.06] but look,
[2849.94 → 2850.82] it's so that
[2850.82 → 2851.58] you will be
[2851.58 → 2852.76] home with me.
[2852.88 → 2853.56] This friendship,
[2854.16 → 2855.12] this relationship,
[2855.48 → 2856.16] this love
[2856.16 → 2858.00] that we have,
[2858.06 → 2858.74] you will never
[2858.74 → 2859.20] lose.
[2860.70 → 2861.54] And that brings
[2861.54 → 2862.16] us to
[2862.16 → 2863.30] the fourth
[2863.30 → 2863.94] thing that
[2863.94 → 2864.78] Jesus wants
[2864.78 → 2866.08] us to believe,
[2866.58 → 2867.20] wants us to
[2867.20 → 2867.66] trust in.
[2868.18 → 2869.18] Not just that
[2869.18 → 2869.78] there is a
[2869.78 → 2870.42] home with
[2870.42 → 2870.90] the Father,
[2871.74 → 2872.56] not just that
[2872.56 → 2873.00] there is a
[2873.00 → 2873.88] place for us
[2873.88 → 2874.20] there,
[2875.00 → 2875.90] not just that
[2875.90 → 2876.44] Jesus has
[2876.44 → 2877.04] prepared the
[2877.04 → 2877.64] way for the
[2877.64 → 2877.96] Father,
[2879.00 → 2880.06] but also that
[2880.06 → 2881.42] he is
[2881.42 → 2882.38] the way
[2882.38 → 2882.88] itself.
[2884.56 → 2885.62] So this is
[2885.62 → 2886.06] when
[2886.06 → 2887.84] Thomas pipes
[2887.84 → 2888.12] in,
[2888.18 → 2888.56] like he's
[2888.56 → 2888.96] been hearing
[2888.96 → 2889.32] all the
[2889.32 → 2889.78] stuff,
[2890.20 → 2891.02] the Father's
[2891.02 → 2891.30] house,
[2891.40 → 2892.02] there are rooms,
[2892.10 → 2892.30] they're going
[2892.30 → 2892.66] to make a
[2892.66 → 2893.34] way for you.
[2894.30 → 2894.64] And,
[2894.68 → 2894.84] you know,
[2894.88 → 2895.56] it is good
[2895.56 → 2896.10] that there
[2896.10 → 2896.40] is a
[2896.40 → 2896.82] disciple
[2896.82 → 2898.14] like Thomas
[2898.14 → 2899.28] because I
[2899.28 → 2899.78] think he
[2899.78 → 2900.48] is so
[2900.48 → 2901.10] often like
[2901.10 → 2901.34] us.
[2901.42 → 2901.52] You know,
[2901.60 → 2901.84] he,
[2901.96 → 2902.98] he asks,
[2903.32 → 2903.74] he's the
[2903.74 → 2904.12] one that
[2904.12 → 2904.48] asks the
[2904.48 → 2905.24] questions that
[2905.24 → 2905.62] we're all
[2905.62 → 2906.80] thinking in
[2906.80 → 2907.24] the gospel.
[2907.46 → 2907.90] He wants
[2907.90 → 2908.50] to understand,
[2908.62 → 2908.72] you know,
[2908.74 → 2909.06] he hasn't
[2909.06 → 2909.64] quite figured
[2909.64 → 2910.26] it out yet.
[2910.68 → 2911.00] He's like,
[2911.06 → 2911.32] Jesus,
[2911.44 → 2912.10] I still don't
[2912.10 → 2912.60] get it.
[2913.48 → 2914.06] So he
[2914.06 → 2914.48] asks the
[2914.48 → 2915.04] question in
[2915.04 → 2915.66] verse 5.
[2916.92 → 2917.22] He says,
[2917.38 → 2917.62] Lord,
[2917.98 → 2919.12] we don't
[2919.12 → 2919.66] know where
[2919.66 → 2920.42] you're going.
[2921.06 → 2921.72] How can
[2921.72 → 2922.18] we know
[2922.18 → 2922.82] the way?
[2924.08 → 2924.48] Right?
[2924.60 → 2924.98] And the
[2924.98 → 2925.96] disciples don't
[2925.96 → 2926.62] understand,
[2926.76 → 2927.36] they don't
[2927.36 → 2927.76] know why
[2927.76 → 2928.38] Jesus has
[2928.38 → 2928.72] to leave
[2928.72 → 2928.96] them.
[2929.64 → 2930.22] How are
[2930.22 → 2930.74] we supposed
[2930.74 → 2931.26] to know
[2931.26 → 2931.66] the way,
[2931.84 → 2931.98] Jesus?
[2933.84 → 2934.48] And how
[2934.48 → 2935.00] does Jesus
[2935.00 → 2935.44] answer?
[2936.44 → 2937.20] He says,
[2937.84 → 2939.04] I am
[2939.04 → 2939.90] the way
[2939.90 → 2941.08] and the
[2941.08 → 2941.58] truth
[2941.58 → 2942.40] and the
[2942.40 → 2942.70] life.
[2944.30 → 2945.08] So what
[2945.08 → 2945.44] I want
[2945.44 → 2945.76] us to
[2945.76 → 2946.80] see first
[2946.80 → 2947.80] about this
[2947.80 → 2948.66] I am
[2948.66 → 2949.14] saying,
[2949.64 → 2950.12] is that
[2950.12 → 2950.58] when Jesus
[2950.58 → 2951.22] says he
[2951.22 → 2951.50] is the
[2951.50 → 2951.86] way and
[2951.86 → 2952.20] the truth
[2952.20 → 2952.46] and the
[2952.46 → 2952.80] life,
[2953.44 → 2954.28] the context
[2954.28 → 2954.84] in which
[2954.84 → 2955.24] that is
[2955.24 → 2955.62] said,
[2956.44 → 2957.78] is that
[2957.78 → 2958.56] Jesus says
[2958.56 → 2958.88] this to
[2958.88 → 2959.52] people who
[2959.52 → 2960.34] are worried
[2960.34 → 2960.76] that he
[2960.76 → 2961.26] is leaving,
[2961.76 → 2962.18] and they
[2962.18 → 2963.14] won't know
[2963.14 → 2964.12] which way
[2964.12 → 2964.66] to go.
[2964.66 → 2974.86] So that's
[2974.86 → 2975.54] the context.
[2975.72 → 2975.80] You know,
[2975.84 → 2976.06] and we
[2976.06 → 2976.66] always know
[2976.66 → 2977.12] this is a
[2977.12 → 2977.62] verse that
[2977.62 → 2978.16] often we
[2978.16 → 2978.54] can kind
[2978.54 → 2978.94] of put
[2978.94 → 2979.24] on our
[2979.24 → 2979.86] wall or
[2979.86 → 2980.12] we can
[2980.12 → 2980.46] put on
[2980.46 → 2980.86] a coffee
[2980.86 → 2981.24] mug and
[2981.24 → 2981.46] that's
[2981.46 → 2981.90] fine,
[2982.88 → 2983.40] but verses
[2983.40 → 2984.08] make the
[2984.08 → 2984.58] most sense
[2984.58 → 2984.82] in their
[2984.82 → 2985.52] context and
[2985.52 → 2985.86] we have
[2985.86 → 2986.16] to know
[2986.16 → 2986.40] that.
[2986.62 → 2986.94] That's
[2986.94 → 2987.38] the context.
[2987.60 → 2987.88] He's not
[2987.88 → 2988.30] talking to
[2988.30 → 2989.04] the Pharisees,
[2989.18 → 2989.60] he's not
[2989.60 → 2990.06] using this
[2990.06 → 2990.42] as an
[2990.42 → 2991.76] argument to
[2991.76 → 2993.38] prove the
[2993.38 → 2994.30] exclusivity of
[2994.30 → 2994.78] Christianity,
[2995.40 → 2995.84] he is
[2995.84 → 2996.56] comforting
[2996.56 → 2996.94] troubled
[2996.94 → 2997.38] disciples.
[2998.28 → 2998.48] He's
[2998.48 → 2998.66] saying,
[2998.86 → 2999.52] I am
[2999.52 → 2999.96] the way.
[3001.78 → 3002.50] And even
[3002.50 → 3003.16] though this
[3003.16 → 3003.52] statement,
[3003.64 → 3003.78] though,
[3003.84 → 3004.44] is aimed
[3004.44 → 3005.02] at soothing
[3005.02 → 3005.78] their fears,
[3006.44 → 3006.92] it's still
[3006.92 → 3007.76] a powerful
[3007.76 → 3008.40] and rich
[3008.40 → 3008.74] statement,
[3008.84 → 3009.28] of course.
[3009.90 → 3010.38] So let's
[3010.38 → 3011.28] consider briefly
[3011.28 → 3011.82] each part
[3011.82 → 3012.08] of it.
[3012.80 → 3013.28] First,
[3013.48 → 3014.32] Jesus uses
[3014.32 → 3015.28] the am.
[3015.92 → 3016.64] He's claiming
[3016.64 → 3017.46] to be God.
[3018.16 → 3018.68] He's claiming
[3018.68 → 3019.24] to have the
[3019.24 → 3019.96] same identity
[3019.96 → 3020.82] as the God
[3020.82 → 3021.24] who led
[3021.24 → 3021.74] his people
[3021.74 → 3022.30] out of
[3022.30 → 3022.72] Egypt
[3022.72 → 3023.78] into the
[3023.78 → 3024.12] promised
[3024.12 → 3024.60] land.
[3026.40 → 3027.20] But in
[3027.20 → 3027.94] direct answer
[3027.94 → 3028.48] to Thomas'
[3028.64 → 3029.16] question,
[3029.34 → 3030.06] Jesus says
[3030.06 → 3030.70] he is
[3030.70 → 3031.42] the way
[3031.42 → 3032.18] to get
[3032.18 → 3032.76] to God.
[3033.72 → 3034.18] And so
[3034.18 → 3034.58] Thomas'
[3034.80 → 3035.48] question
[3035.48 → 3036.88] portrays a
[3036.88 → 3037.52] fundamental
[3037.52 → 3038.86] lack of
[3038.86 → 3039.56] understanding
[3039.56 → 3040.34] in Jesus'
[3040.72 → 3041.46] purpose.
[3042.28 → 3043.08] Why Jesus
[3043.08 → 3043.56] came.
[3044.30 → 3044.94] He's viewing
[3044.94 → 3045.72] Jesus as
[3045.72 → 3046.36] one who
[3046.36 → 3047.22] must come
[3047.22 → 3048.36] and lead
[3048.36 → 3048.84] the way.
[3049.28 → 3049.96] He's still
[3049.96 → 3050.40] looking at
[3050.40 → 3051.66] Jesus as
[3051.66 → 3052.20] someone who
[3052.20 → 3052.78] must come
[3052.78 → 3053.40] and show
[3053.40 → 3054.04] the way
[3054.04 → 3054.94] kind of
[3054.94 → 3055.22] like to
[3055.22 → 3055.56] be a
[3055.56 → 3056.06] guide
[3056.06 → 3056.76] or to
[3056.76 → 3057.06] be a
[3057.06 → 3057.96] trailblazer
[3057.96 → 3059.18] for others
[3059.18 → 3059.50] to then
[3059.50 → 3059.92] follow.
[3061.32 → 3061.90] So if
[3061.90 → 3062.36] Jesus
[3062.36 → 3063.56] hasn't shown
[3063.56 → 3064.32] the way,
[3064.98 → 3065.48] how will
[3065.48 → 3066.00] Thomas know
[3066.00 → 3066.34] how to
[3066.34 → 3066.72] follow?
[3066.96 → 3067.40] That's what
[3067.40 → 3068.04] he's saying
[3068.04 → 3068.46] to Jesus.
[3069.26 → 3069.68] And Thomas'
[3069.82 → 3070.48] question is
[3070.48 → 3070.98] showing that
[3070.98 → 3071.52] he still
[3071.52 → 3071.92] believes,
[3072.04 → 3072.86] maybe as
[3072.86 → 3073.14] some of
[3073.14 → 3073.52] us do
[3073.52 → 3073.94] still,
[3074.62 → 3075.30] that we
[3075.30 → 3076.16] must follow
[3076.16 → 3077.16] Jesus all
[3077.16 → 3077.72] the way
[3077.72 → 3078.24] to get to
[3078.24 → 3078.68] the Father.
[3079.86 → 3080.40] But friends,
[3080.46 → 3080.88] that is not
[3080.88 → 3081.38] the case.
[3081.38 → 3082.32] It's not
[3082.32 → 3082.64] the case
[3082.64 → 3083.30] for Thomas.
[3083.74 → 3084.16] It's not
[3084.16 → 3084.84] the case
[3084.84 → 3085.82] for anyone.
[3087.14 → 3087.62] Jesus is
[3087.62 → 3087.98] saying,
[3088.84 → 3089.16] I'm not
[3089.16 → 3089.72] the way
[3089.72 → 3090.70] as in
[3090.70 → 3092.04] the example
[3092.04 → 3092.78] you must
[3092.78 → 3093.18] follow.
[3093.58 → 3094.46] I am
[3094.46 → 3095.14] the way
[3095.14 → 3095.70] itself.
[3096.80 → 3097.28] That's why
[3097.28 → 3098.12] Jesus earlier
[3098.12 → 3098.62] told his
[3098.62 → 3099.02] disciples,
[3099.26 → 3099.92] where I am
[3099.92 → 3100.30] going,
[3100.46 → 3101.04] you cannot
[3101.04 → 3101.64] follow.
[3102.14 → 3103.06] Because only
[3103.06 → 3103.58] Jesus,
[3104.38 → 3104.96] only the
[3104.96 → 3105.64] perfect son
[3105.64 → 3106.08] of God,
[3106.16 → 3106.68] is able to
[3106.68 → 3107.10] die in
[3107.10 → 3107.44] the place
[3107.44 → 3107.86] of sinners.
[3108.82 → 3109.56] Only Jesus
[3109.56 → 3110.28] can be the
[3110.28 → 3110.88] sacrificial
[3110.88 → 3111.42] lamb of
[3111.42 → 3111.82] God,
[3111.90 → 3112.56] who takes
[3112.56 → 3113.10] away the
[3113.10 → 3113.48] sin of
[3113.48 → 3114.02] the world.
[3114.60 → 3115.40] Only Jesus
[3115.40 → 3115.90] can seek
[3115.90 → 3116.30] and save
[3116.30 → 3116.90] the lost.
[3118.22 → 3118.86] So Jesus
[3118.86 → 3119.84] has to be
[3119.84 → 3121.26] more than
[3121.26 → 3121.90] our example.
[3122.32 → 3122.76] He has to
[3122.76 → 3123.10] be our
[3123.10 → 3123.42] saviour.
[3124.08 → 3124.60] He has to
[3124.60 → 3125.14] not only
[3125.14 → 3126.08] show us
[3126.08 → 3126.60] the way,
[3127.70 → 3128.26] he has to
[3128.26 → 3128.84] be the way.
[3128.94 → 3129.38] We can't
[3129.38 → 3129.90] just,
[3130.06 → 3130.38] he can't
[3130.38 → 3130.76] show us
[3130.76 → 3131.02] the way
[3131.02 → 3131.28] and us
[3131.28 → 3131.94] follow it.
[3132.18 → 3132.60] We can't
[3132.60 → 3133.04] go die
[3133.04 → 3133.52] for our
[3133.52 → 3134.26] own sins.
[3135.00 → 3135.26] Jesus
[3135.26 → 3135.84] is the
[3135.84 → 3136.12] way.
[3136.26 → 3136.66] There is
[3136.66 → 3137.04] no other
[3137.04 → 3137.42] way.
[3137.92 → 3138.24] And that's
[3138.24 → 3138.98] why he says
[3138.98 → 3139.46] no one
[3139.46 → 3139.82] comes to
[3139.82 → 3140.24] the Father
[3140.24 → 3141.26] except through
[3141.26 → 3141.58] me.
[3142.34 → 3142.74] There is
[3142.74 → 3143.50] one way
[3143.50 → 3144.08] and he
[3144.08 → 3144.58] is it.
[3145.24 → 3145.66] There is
[3145.66 → 3146.10] no other
[3146.10 → 3146.44] way.
[3146.58 → 3146.80] If you
[3146.80 → 3147.32] want God,
[3147.38 → 3147.80] you must
[3147.80 → 3148.42] have Jesus.
[3150.44 → 3151.12] In a
[3151.12 → 3151.72] similar way,
[3151.80 → 3152.22] he says,
[3152.32 → 3152.76] I am the
[3152.76 → 3153.18] truth.
[3154.06 → 3154.52] And that
[3154.52 → 3155.56] means he
[3155.56 → 3156.02] does not
[3156.02 → 3157.04] just speak
[3157.04 → 3157.70] the truth
[3157.70 → 3158.40] like you
[3158.40 → 3158.86] or I
[3158.86 → 3159.94] might if
[3159.94 → 3160.32] we are
[3160.32 → 3161.46] under oath
[3161.46 → 3161.98] at a
[3161.98 → 3162.34] trial.
[3163.02 → 3163.84] He is
[3163.84 → 3164.48] the truth.
[3164.48 → 3165.62] He is
[3165.62 → 3166.14] the very
[3166.14 → 3167.18] word of
[3167.18 → 3167.46] God,
[3167.52 → 3168.08] the eternal
[3168.08 → 3169.18] word that
[3169.18 → 3169.82] created the
[3169.82 → 3170.24] heavens and
[3170.24 → 3170.74] the earth
[3170.74 → 3174.10] come and
[3174.10 → 3175.50] made into
[3175.50 → 3176.20] human flesh.
[3178.00 → 3179.38] Untruth or
[3179.38 → 3181.02] half-truths or
[3181.02 → 3182.08] deception or
[3182.08 → 3183.64] deceit, none
[3183.64 → 3184.12] of this is
[3184.12 → 3184.64] present in
[3184.64 → 3184.88] Jesus.
[3185.06 → 3185.62] There is no
[3185.62 → 3186.40] other truth
[3186.40 → 3187.84] besides Jesus.
[3188.24 → 3188.94] He is it.
[3191.00 → 3191.64] And then
[3191.64 → 3192.20] lastly, he
[3192.20 → 3192.78] says he is
[3192.78 → 3193.28] the life.
[3194.04 → 3194.18] Right?
[3194.18 → 3194.60] And that
[3194.60 → 3195.00] means there
[3195.00 → 3195.28] is no
[3195.28 → 3195.98] life besides
[3195.98 → 3196.34] him.
[3197.40 → 3197.86] He is the
[3197.86 → 3198.36] one who
[3198.36 → 3198.74] has put
[3198.74 → 3199.64] death to
[3199.64 → 3200.68] death in
[3200.68 → 3201.20] his own
[3201.20 → 3201.70] death on
[3201.70 → 3202.16] the cross.
[3202.72 → 3203.56] He is then
[3203.56 → 3204.36] the firstborn
[3204.36 → 3205.06] from the
[3205.06 → 3205.34] dead.
[3205.94 → 3206.36] He is the
[3206.36 → 3207.30] eternal life
[3207.30 → 3208.36] of God who
[3208.36 → 3209.18] became man and
[3209.18 → 3209.92] took on flesh.
[3210.22 → 3210.66] And if you
[3210.66 → 3211.48] want eternal
[3211.48 → 3212.22] life, if you
[3212.22 → 3213.56] want to have
[3213.56 → 3214.54] this home again
[3214.54 → 3215.46] with the God
[3215.46 → 3216.62] who is eternal,
[3217.26 → 3217.98] the life for
[3217.98 → 3218.46] which you were
[3218.46 → 3219.82] made, he is
[3219.82 → 3220.70] the only source
[3220.70 → 3221.48] of that life.
[3222.88 → 3223.08] Okay?
[3223.16 → 3223.96] And so putting
[3223.96 → 3224.66] it all together,
[3226.30 → 3226.84] Jesus is
[3226.84 → 3227.56] assuring his
[3227.56 → 3228.40] disciples and
[3228.40 → 3229.62] us who are
[3229.62 → 3232.28] worried by the
[3232.28 → 3233.18] troubles of
[3233.18 → 3235.50] life, who worry
[3235.50 → 3236.24] also that they
[3236.24 → 3236.88] don't know
[3236.88 → 3237.98] enough or
[3237.98 → 3239.14] understand enough
[3239.14 → 3239.92] or have done
[3239.92 → 3240.38] enough.
[3240.64 → 3241.44] And Jesus says,
[3241.56 → 3242.42] if you have me,
[3242.50 → 3243.08] it's enough.
[3243.96 → 3245.54] I am all the
[3245.54 → 3246.40] way, all the
[3246.40 → 3247.40] truth, all the
[3247.40 → 3248.56] life that you
[3248.56 → 3248.96] need.
[3249.66 → 3250.46] There is no
[3250.46 → 3251.16] other life,
[3251.50 → 3251.90] there is no
[3251.90 → 3252.68] other security,
[3252.94 → 3253.44] there is nothing
[3253.44 → 3254.02] else you can
[3254.02 → 3254.76] ultimately have
[3254.76 → 3256.52] confidence in that
[3256.52 → 3257.68] can hold you in
[3257.68 → 3258.38] the midst of the
[3258.38 → 3259.24] troubles of this
[3259.24 → 3259.60] life.
[3261.18 → 3261.92] So this whole
[3261.92 → 3262.68] passage, friends,
[3262.74 → 3264.46] is intended to
[3264.46 → 3266.60] be a balm to
[3266.60 → 3267.30] soothe our
[3267.30 → 3268.20] troubled hearts and
[3268.20 → 3268.48] souls.
[3269.72 → 3270.78] It doesn't mean
[3270.78 → 3271.44] that we're not
[3271.44 → 3271.90] going to be
[3271.90 → 3272.42] anxious.
[3273.00 → 3273.74] It's not going to
[3273.74 → 3274.22] mean that we
[3274.22 → 3275.08] won't face any
[3275.08 → 3275.46] trouble.
[3275.46 → 3277.64] but it means
[3277.64 → 3279.40] that you have
[3279.40 → 3280.30] a home with
[3280.30 → 3280.84] the Father,
[3281.32 → 3282.32] that Jesus has
[3282.32 → 3283.06] made the way,
[3283.16 → 3283.64] that there's a
[3283.64 → 3284.30] place for you,
[3284.40 → 3285.80] that Jesus, God
[3285.80 → 3286.74] wants to dwell
[3286.74 → 3287.56] with you now
[3287.56 → 3288.70] and forever.
[3290.64 → 3291.00] You know, the
[3291.00 → 3291.88] only command
[3291.88 → 3292.56] really in this
[3292.56 → 3293.26] passage is to
[3293.26 → 3293.70] believe.
[3294.70 → 3295.42] The rest of the
[3295.42 → 3296.20] content here is
[3296.20 → 3297.24] just promise after
[3297.24 → 3298.50] promise of how
[3298.50 → 3299.38] Jesus will take
[3299.38 → 3300.10] care of his
[3300.10 → 3301.86] people in this
[3301.86 → 3303.06] life and in the
[3303.06 → 3303.46] next.
[3303.46 → 3304.50] You know, and
[3304.50 → 3305.16] I mean, what a
[3305.16 → 3306.16] passage for us.
[3306.28 → 3307.12] What a passage for
[3307.12 → 3307.76] our world.
[3308.58 → 3309.58] Because lots of
[3309.58 → 3310.80] us, we face all
[3310.80 → 3311.38] kinds of different
[3311.38 → 3311.70] troubles.
[3312.46 → 3313.54] We face financial
[3313.54 → 3314.94] trouble, health
[3314.94 → 3316.08] trouble, emotional
[3316.08 → 3317.08] trouble, relational
[3317.08 → 3317.50] trouble.
[3317.72 → 3318.40] We face an
[3318.40 → 3319.66] uncertain future.
[3320.26 → 3320.96] We're living
[3320.96 → 3321.92] through a pandemic
[3321.92 → 3323.28] and more.
[3324.08 → 3325.08] And Jesus says,
[3325.90 → 3326.88] here I am.
[3327.80 → 3328.48] He offers
[3328.48 → 3329.22] himself and he
[3329.22 → 3329.92] says, believe in
[3329.92 → 3330.30] me.
[3331.10 → 3332.26] Trust in me.
[3332.26 → 3334.12] home is
[3334.12 → 3336.10] wherever I am
[3336.10 → 3336.54] with you.
[3337.70 → 3338.52] Jesus is
[3338.52 → 3339.06] everything we
[3339.06 → 3339.34] need.
[3339.72 → 3341.68] So friends, let
[3341.68 → 3343.18] not your
[3343.18 → 3343.98] hearts be
[3343.98 → 3344.28] troubled.
[3345.20 → 3345.88] Let's pray
[3345.88 → 3346.22] together.
[3349.82 → 3350.72] Father, we
[3350.72 → 3351.60] thank you that
[3351.60 → 3353.82] in the midst of
[3353.82 → 3354.70] a broken world,
[3354.82 → 3355.54] in the midst of
[3355.54 → 3356.36] hearts that are
[3356.36 → 3358.02] deeply troubled
[3358.02 → 3359.34] and sinful,
[3359.34 → 3361.14] trouble, where
[3361.14 → 3361.92] trouble comes to
[3361.92 → 3362.44] us and we
[3362.44 → 3363.28] cause trouble.
[3364.34 → 3365.28] Lord, into
[3365.28 → 3366.44] this you came
[3366.44 → 3368.66] with life, with
[3368.66 → 3370.54] truth, and that
[3370.54 → 3372.60] you have come and
[3372.60 → 3373.46] brought home to
[3373.46 → 3373.86] us.
[3374.68 → 3376.32] That wherever you
[3376.32 → 3377.22] are and wherever
[3377.22 → 3378.12] we are with you,
[3378.20 → 3379.48] united to Christ by
[3379.48 → 3380.68] faith, that we are
[3380.68 → 3383.22] in heaven now and

[3385.00 → 3386.36] Lord, we pray that
[3386.36 → 3387.94] you would continue to
[3387.94 → 3388.68] soothe and comfort
[3388.68 → 3389.08] us.
[3389.76 → 3390.56] And Lord, not only
[3390.56 → 3391.46] for ourselves, would
[3391.46 → 3393.30] you make us people
[3393.30 → 3394.60] who can then go and
[3394.60 → 3396.42] comfort a world that
[3396.42 → 3397.14] is deeply troubled.
[3398.00 → 3399.28] Father, use us as a
[3399.28 → 3402.50] church to be your
[3402.50 → 3404.38] soothing balm for
[3404.38 → 3405.34] Latina, for Delta,
[3405.50 → 3406.14] for this world.
[3407.50 → 3408.14] Lord, would you do
[3408.14 → 3409.68] your work in us and
[3409.68 → 3410.58] help us to trust in
[3410.58 → 3410.74] you.
[3411.00 → 3411.72] We pray in Jesus'
[3411.92 → 3412.08] name.
[3412.58 → 3412.86] Amen.
[3412.86 → 3412.94] Amen.
[3414.36 → 3415.82] So we will sing our
[3415.82 → 3416.70] song of response.
[3416.70 → 3422.44] silence by
[3422.44 → 3426.56] Dolph Solis.

[3446.32 → 3449.78] Set my heart on things above.
[3450.40 → 3453.66] May my life tell your goodness,
[3454.72 → 3457.98] your way of truth and love.

[3480.00 → 3483.36] hear your shout of jubilation,
[3484.02 → 3487.42] no more tears that for pain.
[3487.42 → 3491.42] Every word at last accomplished,
[3492.08 → 3495.62] heaven saves and earth replies
[3495.62 → 3499.62] To our God be the glory,
[3500.34 → 3503.62] let all creation cry.
[3504.04 → 3507.58] Praise and honour to Christ,
[3508.08 → 3511.90] word of God, word of life.
[3511.90 → 3529.46] So let us know, as God's people,
[3530.32 → 3531.54] together in heart,
[3532.04 → 3533.22] go to the Lord in prayer.
[3533.30 → 3534.50] Would you please pray with me?

[3561.04 → 3565.88] Let us not forget that you hear us and that you see us.
[3565.88 → 3571.22] Father, we pray for those struggling with addictions
[3571.22 → 3575.62] and who long to see change come in their lives.
[3576.88 → 3579.72] Father, we pray for those that live alone
[3579.72 → 3585.00] and who are especially lonely in this time of isolation.

[3590.38 → 3596.74] that you would guide them, protect them, and grow them in the faith.
[3598.44 → 3600.46] We pray for our marriages,
[3601.10 → 3604.32] that you will heal them, deepen them,
[3604.70 → 3608.16] and use them as light in the world.

[3620.98 → 3624.30] and pray that you would continue to provide.
[3626.12 → 3629.82] We pray for those who struggle with depression and anxiety,
[3630.36 → 3631.78] that you would bring healing,
[3632.68 → 3635.96] that you would lift their spirits
[3635.96 → 3638.34] and pray for those who are looking for.
[3638.34 → 3638.78] We pray for those who are looking for.
[3638.78 → 3641.18] We pray that you would heal the world, Lord,
[3641.28 → 3644.18] of this coronavirus by your sovereign hand,
[3644.68 → 3647.20] by vaccines, and by other means.
[3648.78 → 3651.72] And Lord, we ask for our sakes
[3651.72 → 3654.46] and for the sakes of our neighbours
[3654.46 → 3656.10] who we want to reach out to,
[3656.16 → 3660.32] that you would enable us to meet and worship you in person again very soon.
[3662.34 → 3665.78] Father, we pray for those who don't yet believe and trust in you,
[3666.94 → 3667.26] Jesus.
[3668.38 → 3671.60] We pray that we could be the vessels to bring them
[3671.60 → 3674.32] by the work of your Holy Spirit to know you,
[3674.78 → 3677.34] the God who comforts our troubled hearts.
[3679.10 → 3680.78] Jesus, you know our needs.
[3681.56 → 3685.04] We lift them each to you now.
[3686.08 → 3688.20] And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[3689.20 → 3689.52] Amen.
[3689.52 → 3693.66] So now, brothers and sisters,
[3694.08 → 3699.26] we go forth not only having been called to God,
[3699.90 → 3702.18] but we go out being blessed by him.
[3702.32 → 3704.82] We go into the world to live with him,
[3704.82 → 3706.60] and we dwell with him wherever we go,
[3706.68 → 3708.20] in our homes and at work,
[3708.38 → 3709.68] not just here in a sanctuary.
[3710.34 → 3711.70] So receive this blessing.
[3711.70 → 3714.04] I invite you to hold out your hands
[3714.04 → 3717.90] and receive the good word from your Father.
[3718.64 → 3720.60] The Lord bless you and keep you.
