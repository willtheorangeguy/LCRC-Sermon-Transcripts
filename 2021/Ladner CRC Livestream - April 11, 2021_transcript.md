[307.00 --> 309.00]  Good morning.
[309.00 --> 328.00]  We have come together to worship our risen Lord and King.
[328.00 --> 331.72]  If you are spiritually weary and in search of rest,
[332.28 --> 335.54]  if you are mourning and you long for comfort,
[336.26 --> 339.56]  if you are struggling and desire victory,
[340.40 --> 344.56]  if you recognize that you are a sinner and need a savior,
[345.82 --> 348.58]  God welcomes you here in the name of Christ.
[348.58 --> 352.22]  To the stranger, to the curious,
[352.86 --> 355.36]  to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[355.36 --> 358.96]  and to whoever would join us today,
[359.28 --> 362.62]  we welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[363.76 --> 367.76]  Today we also especially welcome Pastor Len,
[367.90 --> 373.54]  who will be joining us today again after a long time not being with us,
[373.56 --> 375.54]  so we're happy to have him bring the message today.
[375.54 --> 379.04]  And today we also welcome two new members through baptism,
[379.36 --> 382.42]  and that's a very wonderful time of celebration,
[382.64 --> 383.84]  so we look forward to that.
[383.84 --> 387.84]  Our offering today is for World Renew,
[388.80 --> 393.16]  who is changing the story for those suffering injustice,
[394.30 --> 396.34]  poverty, and displacement.
[398.38 --> 400.96]  World Renew also offers webinars and training
[400.96 --> 403.96]  for those who would like to become involved in advocacy.
[404.98 --> 408.70]  Cindy Stover leads that and was in this church a few years ago
[408.70 --> 410.06]  offering this training,
[410.06 --> 413.50]  and she will be heading up two workshops in May.
[413.98 --> 418.28]  You can go to the World Renew website to find out more or ask me.
[420.22 --> 425.68]  The risen Christ invites us with open arms through these words from John 10, verse 10.
[426.62 --> 431.90]  I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.
[431.90 --> 434.04]  Please pray with me.
[434.04 --> 438.68]  How graciously you welcome us, Lord Jesus.
[439.48 --> 444.40]  Give us just a glimpse of your glory and the abundant life you have for us.
[445.36 --> 451.22]  May we enjoy honest, humble, and single-minded fellowship with you this day
[451.22 --> 455.68]  to the glory of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[456.52 --> 456.82]  Amen.
[456.82 --> 462.98]  And as we get ourselves ready to worship this morning,
[463.44 --> 467.08]  maybe just in your heads think about somebody that you can call after the service
[467.08 --> 468.94]  to have a little chat with,
[469.04 --> 471.60]  maybe someone you haven't talked to for a long time.
[472.10 --> 475.54]  That kind of helps us to have good fellowship together,
[475.74 --> 478.78]  even in this time of meeting virtually.
[478.78 --> 508.76]  Thank you.
[508.78 --> 524.66]  Come people of the risen King,
[524.66 --> 528.94]  who delight to bring Him praise.
[529.18 --> 533.60]  Come all and tune your hearts to sing
[533.60 --> 537.78]  to the morning star of grace.
[537.78 --> 542.54]  From the shifting shadows of the earth,
[542.66 --> 546.66]  we will lift our eyes to Him.
[546.66 --> 551.42]  Where steady arms of mercy reach
[551.42 --> 555.50]  to gather children in.
[556.66 --> 559.98]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[560.34 --> 563.66]  Let every tongue rejoice!
[563.66 --> 572.54]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[572.54 --> 584.02]  Come those whose joy is morning sun,
[584.02 --> 588.30]  and those weeping through the night.
[588.42 --> 592.88]  Come those who tell of battles won,
[592.88 --> 596.96]  and those struggling in the fight.
[596.96 --> 601.72]  For His perfect love will never change,
[601.72 --> 605.84]  and His mercies never cease.
[605.84 --> 610.60]  But follow us through all our days,
[610.60 --> 614.72]  with a certain hope of peace.
[614.72 --> 615.72]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[615.72 --> 619.48]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[619.48 --> 623.60]  Let every tongue rejoice!

[632.48 --> 637.24]  O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[637.24 --> 638.36]  O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[638.36 --> 643.96]  From young and old, from every land,
[643.96 --> 647.90]  men and women of the faith,
[647.90 --> 652.50]  come those with full or empty hands,
[652.50 --> 656.44]  find the riches of His grace.
[656.44 --> 661.20]  Over all the world His people sing,
[661.20 --> 665.32]  Sure to shore we hear them call,
[665.32 --> 669.92]  The truth that cries through every age,
[669.92 --> 673.92]  Our God is all in all.
[673.92 --> 678.32]  Rejoice! Rejoice!
[678.32 --> 682.32]  Let every tongue rejoice!
[682.32 --> 692.20]  One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[692.20 --> 705.08]  We will feast in the house of Zion,
[705.08 --> 711.08]  We will sing with our hearts,
[711.08 --> 717.08]  We will feast in the house of Zion,

[964.38 --> 968.56]  Again, I think thegment of an 놀�ling of influences basically happening in Kargen just after that.
[969.16 --> 975.30]  author never has to come lately, so the family is also lost and not given to him
[975.78 --> 980.78]  and while also is on the Sunday of policing and all their friends I went to give away with my friends.
[980.78 --> 982.36]  Thank you also for the 되 trov.
[982.36 --> 984.82]  The her new boy started coming into Christian school,
[985.10 --> 988.58]  after that much my true disciples is easier for them
[988.58 --> 992.64]  Also, I think this is very cool.
[992.64 --> 998.06]  Particularly,
[998.26 --> 1000.24]  Let them see,
[1000.24 --> 1003.92]  Jesus collect his help
[1003.92 --> 1006.62]  So it is like this.
[1006.62 --> 1008.38]  I readèdly
[1008.38 --> 1009.50]  that in this gift,
[1009.50 --> 1012.02]  I Pviewed off after
[1012.02 --> 1013.08]  Jesus and The documented
[1013.08 --> 1015.58]  I believe there were
[1015.58 --> 1015.86]  the original
[1015.86 --> 1017.26]  when I was there
[1017.26 --> 1018.36]  in mind Our
[1018.36 --> 1025.36]  I'm still busy, but I will try to read the Bible and listen to Nancy's translation.
[1025.36 --> 1031.36]  Every week I will be able to teach and accept the Bible.
[1036.36 --> 1043.36]  Hello, I'm Alicia. I'm from Guangzhou.
[1043.36 --> 1047.36]  So you can hear me from the Chinese language.
[1047.36 --> 1050.36]  We have a family member of the family.
[1050.36 --> 1053.36]  One is my mother, a Christian.
[1053.36 --> 1057.36]  And my son, and my son, Jayden.
[1057.36 --> 1059.36]  He is 5 years old.
[1059.36 --> 1064.36]  He will go to Delta Christian to study.
[1064.36 --> 1067.36]  We have three children.
[1068.36 --> 1071.36]  How do I know?
[1071.36 --> 1074.36]  16 years ago, I came to温哥华.
[1074.36 --> 1081.36]  He created my brother.
[1081.36 --> 1085.36]  Five years ago, I have crucial lessons.
[1085.36 --> 1092.64]  I will invite my friends to meet up the教会 that I met earlier in the way,
[1092.64 --> 1096.84]  when Iamarva the friend said three years ago,
[1096.84 --> 1100.52]  I callediv hip으로 I became a Christian,
[1100.52 --> 1104.08]  which was the emotional experience.
[1104.08 --> 1107.36]  When it was done then,
[1107.36 --> 1111.82]  I realized something else with the Holy Lord,
[1111.82 --> 1114.82]  Thank you for having me in this 10 years.
[1114.82 --> 1117.82]  I have never thought of me.
[1117.82 --> 1122.82]  I love my child.
[1122.82 --> 1124.82]  Through different people,
[1124.82 --> 1128.82]  I will bring me back to the church.
[1128.82 --> 1129.82]  Thank you.
[1129.82 --> 1143.82]  I love the Bible.
[1143.82 --> 1146.82]  I love the Bible.
[1146.82 --> 1148.82]  I love the Lord.
[1148.82 --> 1150.82]  I love the Lord.
[1150.82 --> 1153.82]  Because this is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1153.82 --> 1156.82]  Jesus Christ has given you the duty.
[1156.82 --> 1161.82]  Why do I love this scripture?
[1161.82 --> 1163.82]  Because I think
[1163.82 --> 1165.82]  when we live in this world,
[1165.82 --> 1167.82]  we must always feel happy,
[1167.82 --> 1169.82]  and feel happy.
[1169.82 --> 1171.82]  And know that we are grateful.
[1171.82 --> 1174.82]  When we are not going to pray for God,
[1174.82 --> 1178.82]  we will receive the blessing.
[1178.82 --> 1181.82]  And when we are getting the blessing of God,
[1181.82 --> 1184.82]  we will be grateful for God.
[1184.82 --> 1186.82]  In this time,
[1186.82 --> 1188.82]  we will know that
[1188.82 --> 1191.82]  what we are doing is good.
[1191.82 --> 1193.82]  It is good.
[1193.82 --> 1195.82]  It is good.
[1195.82 --> 1197.82]  It is good.
[1197.82 --> 1200.82]  When you have this heart,
[1200.82 --> 1205.82]  you will find you will be grateful.
[1205.82 --> 1207.82]  And the heart of God is good.
[1207.82 --> 1209.82]  It is a good attitude.
[1209.82 --> 1211.82]  It is a good attitude.
[1211.82 --> 1212.82]  From These thoughts you will be happy.
[1212.82 --> 1214.82]  My own will not give me.
[1214.82 --> 1216.82]  From These thoughts you don'tacă.
[1216.82 --> 1217.82]  When with ever he comes to olmaz.
[1217.82 --> 1218.82]  One be Awakening and innocent.
[1218.82 --> 1219.82]  esa crenateral.
[1219.82 --> 1220.82]  In this time,
[1220.82 --> 1221.82]  people are unhappy.
[1221.82 --> 1222.82]  Speaking of things which means having moans.
[1222.82 --> 1223.82]  One can yourijnках be.
[1223.82 --> 1224.82]  Even if your world…
[1224.86 --> 1225.82]  There are other things going to be better.
[1225.82 --> 1226.82]  That's because we areиц게.
[1226.82 --> 1227.82]  Hopefully,
[1227.82 --> 1228.82]  the mood will bring more.
[1228.82 --> 1230.94]  And the beauty of fear
[1230.94 --> 1232.82]  this wholeheart situation is true.
[1232.82 --> 1239.14]  常常保持喜乐的心,常祷告,凡事谢恩。
[1241.98 --> 1248.80]  感谢主让我在四月份福祸节这个时间受洗,
[1249.28 --> 1251.78]  这个月也是我的生日,是下周。
[1252.78 --> 1256.36]  感谢主让我在我生日的时候得到重生,
[1257.56 --> 1261.56]  求主带领我,看顾我,走正义的路,
[1261.56 --> 1267.02]  让我继续可以爱主,爱朋友,爱家人。
[1268.02 --> 1268.86]  阿们。
[1280.30 --> 1286.08]  So we had a number of people, adults and their children,
[1286.42 --> 1288.44]  who were all going to be baptized on Easter,
[1288.44 --> 1292.20]  but there were these constantly changing restrictions,
[1292.20 --> 1294.12]  and so it ended up that on Easter,
[1294.24 --> 1296.52]  we still were not able to be in person together.
[1297.52 --> 1300.02]  And so we were going to do all the baptisms that day,
[1300.14 --> 1302.88]  but now we have actually, it's worked out really well,
[1302.94 --> 1306.44]  we have the opportunity to, for five Sundays,
[1306.90 --> 1309.46]  baptize a couple people each week,
[1309.50 --> 1311.98]  and this way we can be within the restrictions that we have,
[1311.98 --> 1317.14]  but it's an opportunity also that we can get to know each person a lot better,
[1317.28 --> 1321.84]  because we've been, they've been recording these testimonies that we will show each week,
[1322.38 --> 1323.78]  and in this way it's more personal.
[1323.94 --> 1325.96]  And so Easter is actually not just one day,
[1326.52 --> 1329.42]  but it's a season in the church calendar of 50 days,
[1330.12 --> 1333.78]  50 days of joy, 50 days of life and celebration.
[1333.78 --> 1337.16]  And so for five weeks during the season of Easter,
[1337.40 --> 1341.86]  we can celebrate the new life that we can experience in Christ.
[1343.08 --> 1345.74]  And so today you've already met on the video,
[1345.92 --> 1347.64]  this is Charles and Alicia,
[1348.06 --> 1349.90]  and so they will be baptized today.
[1351.22 --> 1356.26]  And so because we don't do baptisms very often, usually in the church,
[1356.60 --> 1359.34]  let me say a brief word again of introduction.
[1359.34 --> 1364.44]  So the Apostle Paul says in the book of Romans,
[1365.20 --> 1370.60]  all of us who are baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death.
[1371.64 --> 1375.78]  We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death,
[1375.98 --> 1379.58]  in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead,
[1380.08 --> 1381.42]  through the glory of the Father,
[1382.10 --> 1384.28]  we too may live a new life.
[1384.84 --> 1386.48]  We have a new life through Jesus.
[1386.48 --> 1393.98]  So the sacrament of baptism is a sign and seal of God's promise
[1393.98 --> 1396.30]  to claim us as his own.
[1396.44 --> 1398.16]  We belong to God in baptism.
[1399.36 --> 1402.92]  Through baptism, we are united together with Jesus.
[1403.98 --> 1408.32]  And being united with him, he washes away our sins,
[1408.46 --> 1409.86]  he forgives us through the cross,
[1409.86 --> 1412.74]  and he gives us the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1412.74 --> 1418.04]  as we embrace all of what Jesus has done for us through faith.
[1418.82 --> 1423.04]  Also, through baptism, Christ calls us to live a new life
[1423.04 --> 1424.88]  where we trust and obey him,
[1425.40 --> 1430.24]  where we forsake sin, turn away from sin, and turn toward Christ.
[1430.96 --> 1433.26]  And he gives us a new and holy life
[1433.26 --> 1435.94]  by his power at work within us,
[1435.98 --> 1437.14]  by his own grace.
[1437.14 --> 1441.22]  And so, Charles and Alicia,
[1441.64 --> 1444.26]  you come before us,
[1444.84 --> 1446.66]  all those who are watching at home,
[1447.10 --> 1448.76]  and the few of us who are here,
[1449.20 --> 1451.76]  to publicly profess your faith
[1451.76 --> 1453.98]  and to receive the sacrament of baptism.
[1454.78 --> 1457.16]  So I'm going to ask you the three questions now,
[1457.32 --> 1458.92]  and I'll ask you to respond.
[1458.92 --> 1465.46]  Do you renounce sin and the power of evil
[1465.46 --> 1468.10]  in your life and in the world?
[1469.52 --> 1470.50]  I renounce them.
[1471.44 --> 1471.70]  Great.
[1472.40 --> 1475.22]  Who is your Lord and Savior?
[1478.22 --> 1482.34]  And will you be faithful members of this congregation
[1482.34 --> 1485.06]  and through worship and service
[1485.06 --> 1488.66]  seek to advance God's kingdom here and throughout the world?
[1488.92 --> 1489.18]  Thank you.
[1491.44 --> 1491.92]  Great.
[1492.20 --> 1492.48]  Okay.
[1493.56 --> 1495.14]  So let me pray for us,
[1495.44 --> 1497.00]  and then we will do the baptisms.
[1497.12 --> 1497.96]  Let's pray together.
[1499.14 --> 1500.28]  Our Heavenly Father,
[1500.46 --> 1502.20]  in the beginning of creation,
[1502.40 --> 1504.78]  your Spirit moved over the waters.
[1505.82 --> 1507.50]  In the waters of the flood,
[1507.60 --> 1508.60]  you destroyed evil.
[1509.72 --> 1512.20]  You led the children of Israel through the sea
[1512.20 --> 1514.10]  and into the freedom of the promised land.
[1515.00 --> 1516.38]  And in the river Jordan,
[1516.78 --> 1518.72]  John baptized our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1519.68 --> 1521.22]  And by his death and resurrection,
[1521.50 --> 1522.96]  Jesus Christ, the living water,
[1523.58 --> 1525.68]  forgives us, frees us from sin and death,
[1525.74 --> 1528.06]  and opens the way to everlasting life.
[1528.76 --> 1531.42]  So Father, we ask that you would pour out
[1531.42 --> 1533.74]  your Holy Spirit upon Charles and Alicia,
[1534.48 --> 1537.38]  that they may have right now,
[1537.54 --> 1539.16]  that they might know your presence,
[1539.38 --> 1542.68]  that they would know the joy of your salvation,
[1542.68 --> 1544.64]  and that they belong to you.
[1544.96 --> 1547.94]  They have been sealed in these waters of baptism
[1547.94 --> 1549.16]  as your own children.
[1549.98 --> 1551.64]  Lord, we pray in Jesus' name,
[1551.72 --> 1552.72]  to the glory of God.
[1553.36 --> 1553.72]  Amen.
[1553.72 --> 1553.84]  Amen.
[1554.84 --> 1555.48]  Okay.
[1559.34 --> 1559.90]  So,
[1560.90 --> 1563.62]  there we go.
[1563.62 --> 1572.62]  So,
[1572.72 --> 1573.00]  Alicia,
[1573.26 --> 1574.74]  I baptize you
[1574.74 --> 1576.30]  in the name of the Father,
[1577.34 --> 1579.26]  in the name of the Son,
[1580.38 --> 1582.56]  in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1582.56 --> 1583.92]  Amen.
[1583.92 --> 1588.22]  Let me stand.
[1588.48 --> 1589.16]  Here you go.
[1596.16 --> 1596.64]  Charles,
[1596.84 --> 1597.62]  I baptize you
[1597.62 --> 1598.66]  in the name of the Father,
[1598.66 --> 1601.44]  and of the Son,
[1602.62 --> 1605.12]  and of the Holy Spirit.
[1606.06 --> 1606.44]  Amen.
[1610.90 --> 1611.86]  There you go.
[1617.68 --> 1618.66]  So, friends,
[1618.76 --> 1620.02]  in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1620.50 --> 1622.16]  who is our King,
[1622.64 --> 1624.26]  who is the head of the Church,
[1624.96 --> 1625.80]  Charles and Alicia,
[1626.24 --> 1627.12]  are now received
[1627.12 --> 1628.30]  into the visible membership
[1628.30 --> 1629.22]  of our church,
[1629.78 --> 1631.12]  of Christ's church worldwide.
[1631.68 --> 1633.16]  They are sealed by the Holy Spirit,
[1633.88 --> 1636.24]  and marked as belonging to Christ forever.
[1637.16 --> 1637.50]  Amen.
[1637.72 --> 1637.94]  And so,
[1638.04 --> 1638.98]  let me pray for you again.
[1640.14 --> 1641.06]  Father in heaven,
[1641.24 --> 1642.92]  we pray that you would stir up
[1642.92 --> 1644.82]  in Alicia and in Charles
[1644.82 --> 1646.04]  the gift of your Holy Spirit.
[1647.00 --> 1647.52]  Lord,
[1647.64 --> 1648.98]  help them each day
[1648.98 --> 1650.40]  to look back on this day
[1650.40 --> 1651.70]  to remember their baptism,
[1652.28 --> 1653.64]  that they belong to you.
[1654.26 --> 1654.42]  Lord,
[1654.46 --> 1655.42]  would you confirm them
[1655.42 --> 1656.40]  in their faith?
[1656.50 --> 1657.42]  Would you guide them
[1657.42 --> 1659.24]  along this path of life?
[1660.28 --> 1660.58]  And Lord,
[1660.66 --> 1661.62]  empower them to live
[1661.62 --> 1663.38]  as your faithful followers.
[1664.12 --> 1664.44]  And Lord,
[1664.50 --> 1665.06]  in the end,
[1665.14 --> 1666.32]  bring them to eternal life.
[1666.92 --> 1668.04]  Through Jesus Christ,
[1668.14 --> 1668.66]  our Lord.
[1669.50 --> 1669.92]  Amen.
[1671.14 --> 1671.36]  Amen.
[1672.96 --> 1673.44]  Congratulations.
[1675.52 --> 1677.22]  And we have a present for you.
[1684.98 --> 1687.60]  Thank you.
[1687.60 --> 1688.62]  Thank you.
[1688.72 --> 1689.18]  Okay.
[1689.50 --> 1689.84]  Thanks.
[1691.30 --> 1692.28]  For all of us here,
[1692.38 --> 1693.62]  maybe we can do a little applause.
[1695.06 --> 1695.50]  Okay.
[1695.90 --> 1696.16]  All right.
[1696.16 --> 1726.14]  Thank you.
[1726.16 --> 1729.16]  I love to sing your praises.
[1730.84 --> 1735.76]  I'm so glad you're in my life.
[1737.08 --> 1741.10]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[1742.06 --> 1748.18]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[1748.18 --> 1754.02]  From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay.
[1754.02 --> 1759.74]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky.
[1760.08 --> 1763.02]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1763.02 --> 1769.02]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1769.02 --> 1774.74]  Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[1774.74 --> 1776.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1776.74 --> 1778.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1778.74 --> 1780.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1780.74 --> 1782.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1782.74 --> 1784.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1784.74 --> 1786.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1786.74 --> 1788.74]  I love to sing your praises.
[1788.74 --> 1794.12]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[1794.12 --> 1799.74]  From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay.
[1799.74 --> 1805.42]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky.
[1805.42 --> 1810.42]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[1810.42 --> 1817.30]  Lord, I lift not to люб for the place.
[1817.40 --> 1821.32]  Lord, I lift my praises.
[1821.42 --> 1825.42]  All rise in your cross.
[1825.42 --> 1855.40]  Thank you.
[1855.42 --> 1885.40]  Thank you.
[1885.42 --> 1887.42]  Thank you.
[1888.80 --> 1889.92]  Sorry about that.
[1890.92 --> 1897.42]  Anyways, it is a delight to be with Ladner Church again, although I much prefer the
[1897.42 --> 1901.30]  way we did it before, when you folks were in the building all together.
[1902.36 --> 1909.42]  I think before Pastor Jason arrived, what, 15 months ago or so, I think I was here quite
[1909.42 --> 1911.92]  a bit, and it was a delight to get to know you.
[1913.12 --> 1919.54]  But now, seeing this morning and the baptism of Alyssa and Charles and hearing their testimony,
[1920.26 --> 1925.86]  I can see that God has been at work in this place, and he has exciting things in store
[1925.86 --> 1927.38]  for this congregation.
[1927.38 --> 1933.82]  So, it really was a blessing and a privilege to be here and to see this, which is just
[1933.82 --> 1937.88]  the beginning of a whole season of welcoming people into the church.
[1938.14 --> 1939.36]  So, good.
[1939.36 --> 1944.46]  So, I'm going to read this morning just a few verses from the Gospel of Luke, chapter
[1944.46 --> 1947.36]  10, the last five verses.
[1948.36 --> 1955.18]  Just a little story about Mary and Martha, two people who knew Jesus well, and they appear
[1955.18 --> 1956.34]  in the Gospel of Luke.
[1956.44 --> 1959.72]  They appear also in the Gospel of John with their brother Lazarus.
[1959.72 --> 1965.16]  And it tells about Martha and Mary.
[1965.30 --> 1969.46]  They're not quite the same kind of people, and that comes out in the story.
[1970.14 --> 1974.20]  But before we get started, I would just point out, this short little story comes at the end
[1974.20 --> 1982.06]  of chapter 10 in the Gospel of Luke, and it follows the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[1982.82 --> 1989.62]  And the Good Samaritan is this Samaritan who found a crime victim lying on the road, and
[1989.62 --> 1995.26]  then as Jesus tells the story, he picked this man up, he bandaged his wounds, he brought
[1995.26 --> 1998.76]  him to an inn, he gave him lodging for the night.
[1999.30 --> 2004.58]  The next morning, he paid the bill and said, if there's more, I'll pay it, you know, as
[2004.58 --> 2005.62]  soon as I get a chance.
[2005.62 --> 2011.92]  So, this Samaritan did wonderful things for this poor victim.
[2012.76 --> 2016.86]  And then immediately after that, Jesus tells, we have this story.
[2016.86 --> 2023.14]  As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha
[2023.14 --> 2024.72]  opened her home to him.
[2025.54 --> 2031.06]  She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
[2032.10 --> 2037.58]  But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made, and she came to him and
[2037.58 --> 2042.58]  asked, Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself?
[2042.80 --> 2043.76]  Tell her to help me.
[2043.76 --> 2051.62]  Martha, Martha, the Lord answered, you are worried and upset about many things, but few
[2051.62 --> 2054.36]  things are needed, or indeed only one.
[2055.16 --> 2059.96]  Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken from her.
[2060.88 --> 2062.36]  So, this is the word of the Lord.
[2062.36 --> 2072.80]  Now, I don't know about you, but I can't help feeling bad for Martha in this story.
[2073.38 --> 2080.80]  It seems to me that Jesus was kind of hard on her after everything she did for him.
[2081.40 --> 2086.22]  I mean, she heard that he was coming, and then she got busy.
[2086.22 --> 2093.44]  She prepared a menu, she bought groceries, she spent a long time in the kitchen, and then
[2093.44 --> 2101.30]  when Jesus arrived, and from the sound of it, he may have arrived early, then she had work
[2101.30 --> 2108.38]  left to do, and she wanted some help, and she asked for it, and then Jesus came down hard
[2108.38 --> 2108.98]  on her.
[2109.78 --> 2112.36]  I can't help feeling bad for her.
[2112.44 --> 2115.02]  What was so wrong about what she did?
[2116.14 --> 2121.72]  You know, over the years, I've known a lot of people like Martha in different churches
[2121.72 --> 2122.58]  I have served.
[2123.36 --> 2126.74]  And believe me, the churches depend on people like her.
[2126.90 --> 2130.22]  We'd have to close the door in a week without them.
[2130.22 --> 2137.98]  You know, check any church bulletin or any, well, today, any church website, and you will
[2137.98 --> 2140.26]  find lists of volunteers.
[2140.52 --> 2144.22]  And more often than not, you'll have a note that's asking for still more.
[2145.42 --> 2147.84]  I mean, we need people like Martha.
[2147.88 --> 2150.50]  I have great respect for people like her.
[2152.72 --> 2156.08]  She reminds me, actually, of my own mother.
[2157.28 --> 2159.58]  You know, my mother was always a real doer.
[2159.58 --> 2161.86]  She was one of the willing worker types.
[2161.98 --> 2165.76]  She was always ready to make another pot of coffee.
[2166.52 --> 2172.60]  For years, she prepared these big meals with a group of volunteers as a fundraiser for the
[2172.60 --> 2174.56]  school, for the Christian school.
[2175.50 --> 2176.98]  She would prepare the menu.
[2177.18 --> 2178.86]  She would get volunteers together.
[2179.02 --> 2180.80]  They'd cook this big feast.
[2180.94 --> 2182.96]  They'd serve it sometimes to hundreds of people.
[2183.58 --> 2187.82]  And then the money that that generated would go to the school.
[2187.82 --> 2189.64]  She was really good at that.
[2190.76 --> 2196.28]  And that's what made it hard for us, for the children, to see her age and then begin to slip
[2196.28 --> 2197.38]  into dementia.
[2197.76 --> 2198.94]  She couldn't do it anymore.
[2199.60 --> 2204.30]  And in the end, she couldn't recognize her own children.
[2204.30 --> 2210.70]  But at her best, she was Martha all the way.
[2210.70 --> 2218.48]  So I am going to stick up for the Martha of the Bible because I'm sticking up for my mother.
[2218.98 --> 2223.62]  And I'm sticking up for women like my mother and a whole bunch of gentlemen, too.
[2223.90 --> 2232.98]  In fact, you could say that here are people that have the gift of service and also the gift of hospitality.
[2232.98 --> 2240.14]  And if you look through those lists of New Testament gifts of the Spirit, you will find them there.
[2240.26 --> 2243.56]  The gift of service, the gift of hospitality.
[2244.50 --> 2246.08]  And Martha had that, too.
[2246.40 --> 2250.14]  So where did she go wrong here?
[2250.14 --> 2262.72]  Now, there was a time in the church history of the past when this little story got extra attention.
[2263.78 --> 2268.82]  You have to go back to what they call the beginnings of the monastic period,
[2268.92 --> 2272.02]  the time when the monasteries were just beginning.
[2272.02 --> 2280.82]  You know, this was a time when people would sort of retreat from the world into monasteries.
[2281.60 --> 2286.74]  And they would devote their lives to lives of contemplation.
[2287.00 --> 2294.50]  And the idea that people took from this story was that the best life is the contemplative life.
[2294.80 --> 2296.22]  The merry life.
[2296.34 --> 2299.90]  The life spent, you know, in quiet devotion.
[2299.90 --> 2308.36]  In that way, they said, you sort of died to the world and you came alive to Christ.
[2308.42 --> 2310.06]  It's almost like being a martyr.
[2312.12 --> 2319.10]  Now, before that, you know, beginnings of the monasteries, there were Christian martyrs.
[2319.98 --> 2327.52]  There were people who died simply because they confessed Christ and were loyal to him.
[2327.80 --> 2329.60]  I mean, it happened right at the start.
[2329.60 --> 2334.90]  The book of Acts tells us about the death of Stephen, the first Christian martyr.
[2335.94 --> 2340.60]  And soon after that, they tell us that this great persecution broke out against the church.
[2341.78 --> 2348.76]  And that was just a start because persecution came in wave after wave for the first couple hundred years.
[2348.90 --> 2353.36]  It was like this slow rolling plague with first wave, second wave.
[2353.36 --> 2355.36]  Persecutions followed persecutions.
[2355.36 --> 2356.00]  Persecutions followed persecutions.
[2357.12 --> 2360.28]  Many Christian people died awful deaths.
[2360.40 --> 2362.54]  Many others were driven into hiding.
[2362.80 --> 2364.48]  They became impoverished.
[2367.16 --> 2369.02]  And then it stopped.
[2371.34 --> 2376.54]  The Roman emperor, Constantine, he was converted.
[2376.54 --> 2378.02]  He became a Christian.
[2379.30 --> 2386.88]  And soon after that, he put out a decree that the Christian religion would be tolerated through the empire.
[2388.50 --> 2393.94]  And not long after that, Christianity became the favored religion.
[2393.94 --> 2398.08]  And so the great terror was over.
[2399.88 --> 2401.62]  Christians were safe.
[2403.24 --> 2405.38]  You could do it openly.
[2406.96 --> 2411.06]  And in fact, it became a kind of advantage to be a Christian.
[2411.20 --> 2413.60]  It could get you a good job with the government.
[2414.08 --> 2417.04]  It could bring more customers into your business.
[2417.04 --> 2420.20]  It was profitable to be a Christian.
[2420.56 --> 2423.46]  So in that period, the church grew quickly.
[2424.40 --> 2425.58]  Many people came in.
[2427.30 --> 2432.72]  Although it's fair to ask if their reasons were sort of open to question.
[2435.28 --> 2441.58]  And there were some, and they were, you know, deeply rooted Christian people.
[2441.58 --> 2446.70]  Some that looked at this new thing, and they were not terribly impressed.
[2447.34 --> 2449.90]  I mean, they looked back to the time of persecution.
[2451.26 --> 2453.96]  And they said, yes, that was the worst of times.
[2454.10 --> 2456.32]  But it was also the best of times.
[2456.34 --> 2460.24]  Because it produced this faith that was strong and sturdy.
[2460.96 --> 2463.88]  You know, there was no phoniness here.
[2464.18 --> 2465.52]  It wasn't for show.
[2465.62 --> 2467.28]  And it sure wasn't for the money.
[2467.80 --> 2471.54]  And now we have this new and easier time.
[2472.30 --> 2475.50]  And there's a lot of advantages to being a Christian.
[2475.92 --> 2478.52]  And it's just not the same anymore.
[2479.06 --> 2483.78]  And they somehow wanted to recapture the spirit of the martyrs.
[2485.86 --> 2491.36]  And so many of them moved into the monastic kind of life.
[2491.98 --> 2493.36]  They took vows.
[2494.32 --> 2495.76]  Vows of chastity.
[2495.90 --> 2497.04]  They would never marry.
[2497.76 --> 2501.64]  Vows of obedience to their religious superiors.
[2502.44 --> 2503.52]  Vows of poverty.
[2503.76 --> 2505.72]  They were not in this for the money.
[2505.72 --> 2514.34]  And they said, in this way, they would, you know, escape the temptations of the world.
[2514.88 --> 2518.66]  And spend their lives in devotion to God.
[2518.66 --> 2524.10]  And one proof they used was the story of Mary and Martha.
[2526.50 --> 2529.26]  Martha, they said, she lived in the world.
[2529.38 --> 2533.28]  She was worried and upset about the things of this world.
[2533.28 --> 2538.76]  And meanwhile, Mary, she quietly rested at the feet of Jesus.
[2539.72 --> 2543.50]  She developed this contemplative, quiet life.
[2543.62 --> 2546.46]  And Jesus said, this is the better life.
[2546.46 --> 2551.34]  And so they said, this is the best life for Christian people.
[2553.50 --> 2555.30]  Now, that time has passed.
[2556.30 --> 2559.56]  And now, there still are monasteries in operation.
[2559.56 --> 2564.62]  But even there, they won't tell you that this is the best life.
[2564.70 --> 2566.84]  And no other life is worth having.
[2567.54 --> 2574.00]  You know, everyone recognizes that life in the world can be a very valid Christian life.
[2574.64 --> 2579.12]  And in many ways, we can serve God wherever we may be.
[2579.24 --> 2581.02]  Wherever he has placed us.
[2581.08 --> 2583.70]  After all, all the world belongs to God.
[2583.82 --> 2585.72]  And all of life is religion.
[2585.72 --> 2590.94]  And so wherever we are, we can live lives of devotion to him.
[2592.76 --> 2602.00]  Martin Luther, the great reformer, he once said that every occupation is honorable to God.
[2602.70 --> 2610.26]  Wherever you do your work, whether it's in the farm or in the shop or in the kitchen,
[2610.84 --> 2613.32]  you are serving the Lord.
[2613.32 --> 2616.70]  Because you are meeting the needs of others.
[2616.84 --> 2618.10]  You're providing their food.
[2618.46 --> 2619.72]  You're providing their shelter.
[2620.04 --> 2621.08]  You're educating them.
[2621.14 --> 2622.38]  You're caring for the sick.
[2622.68 --> 2625.88]  These are all ways of service to God.
[2626.16 --> 2628.16]  And he honors everyone.
[2630.26 --> 2633.26]  In other words, you can be busy out there.
[2634.42 --> 2635.60]  And that's okay.
[2635.60 --> 2641.76]  So then, what about Martha?
[2643.44 --> 2644.90]  How did she go wrong?
[2648.12 --> 2654.06]  Now, I'll mention again that this little story follows hard on the story of the Good Samaritan.
[2654.86 --> 2657.04]  Jesus tells a story about this traveler.
[2657.20 --> 2658.38]  He's on the road to Jericho.
[2658.94 --> 2660.26]  He falls among thieves.
[2660.38 --> 2662.46]  They beat him within an inch of his life.
[2662.46 --> 2664.58]  He's lying there, broken on the road.
[2665.58 --> 2667.74]  And then these two people come past.
[2667.88 --> 2669.64]  First a priest and then a Levite.
[2670.42 --> 2671.96]  And they see him there.
[2672.62 --> 2674.50]  And they cross the road.
[2674.94 --> 2676.24]  And they walk past.
[2676.24 --> 2682.32]  Now, these would be two, you could call them religious professionals.
[2683.90 --> 2688.14]  They knew about the things of God and what mattered to God.
[2688.70 --> 2693.54]  And somehow, a crime victim lying on the road wasn't part of that.
[2694.82 --> 2696.06]  And then we get the Samaritan.
[2697.00 --> 2701.96]  And in Jesus' time, the Samaritans were considered, you know, second-rate believers.
[2702.42 --> 2704.00]  Really not believers at all.
[2704.00 --> 2707.40]  And yet, this is the one who stopped.
[2708.30 --> 2712.78]  And as Jesus tells it, this is the one he took pity on the victim.
[2713.00 --> 2718.44]  He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[2718.78 --> 2723.26]  Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn, and took care of him.
[2723.72 --> 2729.38]  The next day, he took out two denarii, like two days' pay, and gave them to the innkeeper.
[2729.38 --> 2736.60]  Look after him, he said, and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.
[2736.60 --> 2748.46]  You could say that this Samaritan was busy with Martha-type things.
[2750.40 --> 2752.60]  And did Jesus approve?
[2752.70 --> 2753.92]  You bet Jesus approved.
[2754.06 --> 2756.88]  And he said, go and do likewise.
[2756.88 --> 2766.22]  So, again, where did Martha go wrong?
[2767.76 --> 2772.72]  Jesus said, you were worried and upset about many things.
[2772.72 --> 2777.10]  And we sort of know what those many things were.
[2777.24 --> 2786.68]  The menu, the groceries, the cooking, you know, the appetizers, the entree, the desserts, the wine.
[2786.68 --> 2800.00]  And if she were busy with such things today, she might worry a whole lot about the centerpiece for the table and getting each place setting just right with the salad forks properly chilled and all that.
[2801.80 --> 2807.48]  And, you know, in their own way, in their own time, such things are good.
[2807.48 --> 2817.08]  Wouldn't it you could say these are the kinds of things someone does when she's an excellent hostess, gifted with the spiritual gift of hospitality?
[2817.08 --> 2835.56]  But at some point, we do have to stop and ask Martha, Martha, do you realize who you have in your house right now?
[2836.88 --> 2840.44]  You have Jesus in your house right now.
[2841.56 --> 2843.32]  And he is teaching.
[2843.32 --> 2843.52]  He is sharing.
[2844.12 --> 2846.58]  He is sharing his great wisdom.
[2847.22 --> 2849.60]  And your sister is sitting at his feet.
[2849.82 --> 2852.68]  And she is soaking it all in.
[2854.84 --> 2859.84]  And yes, Martha, that is the best thing to do.
[2863.52 --> 2868.16]  You know, whenever we read the Gospels and, you know, the stories of Jesus' ministry,
[2868.16 --> 2873.82]  you're caught by how often people were deeply impressed by his teaching.
[2873.92 --> 2876.64]  They said no one ever spoke like he did.
[2876.86 --> 2879.20]  He spoke as one with authority.
[2879.64 --> 2881.22]  His words had power.
[2881.58 --> 2883.46]  The power to change people.
[2884.32 --> 2892.32]  He told stories about seed that was scattered and in some places it didn't grow and in other places it grew and became abundant.
[2892.32 --> 2901.34]  He told about, you know, walking the second mile and turning the other cheek and making peace with those who have hurt you.
[2901.80 --> 2908.92]  He told stories about sheep that were lost and about good shepherds that went out to find them and wouldn't rest until he did.
[2909.52 --> 2914.70]  He told stories about sons who went to far countries and wasted half the family's money.
[2914.70 --> 2919.72]  And then about fathers who kept waiting for that son to come home again.
[2921.36 --> 2925.14]  Jesus taught us how to forgive and to be forgiven.
[2925.80 --> 2929.06]  How to love and how to be loved.
[2929.64 --> 2936.52]  There is this incredible rich treasury that Jesus left us in his words and in his wisdom.
[2938.30 --> 2942.54]  And yes, we must not miss this.
[2942.54 --> 2947.12]  We must learn from this.
[2948.20 --> 2952.72]  So no, that doesn't mean that what Martha did was trivial and useless.
[2953.08 --> 2954.34]  It has its place.
[2954.60 --> 2955.78]  It has its time.
[2957.78 --> 2966.60]  But don't ever let that distract you from the words and the wisdom and the teachings of Jesus.
[2967.36 --> 2968.60]  That's what Mary did.
[2968.60 --> 2973.54]  She let her mind be formed by the wisdom of Jesus.
[2973.68 --> 2976.72]  She let her heart be formed by the spirit of Jesus.
[2977.16 --> 2980.16]  And that was the best thing.
[2980.16 --> 2990.60]  Now I can't help thinking that that is really important then, but it's just as important now.
[2990.60 --> 2995.00]  Because we live in such a distracted, distractible time.
[2995.50 --> 2998.22]  This has often been called the consumer culture.
[2998.22 --> 3004.18]  And by that, you know, the name itself tells you that this is about stuff.
[3004.88 --> 3009.02]  And it's about being worried and anxious about stuff.
[3009.84 --> 3015.00]  About the things we buy and the things we borrow to buy and the things we have on payments.
[3015.38 --> 3020.06]  And, you know, we can say we live from one consumer emergency to the next.
[3020.06 --> 3023.42]  We have this and we have to pay for this.
[3023.50 --> 3026.04]  We have this and it breaks and it has to be fixed.
[3026.16 --> 3027.38]  And that's a bill we can't pay.
[3027.48 --> 3030.94]  On and on our consumer emergencies go.
[3032.86 --> 3039.76]  And we can tell ourselves, I will have time for God when this one is fixed.
[3039.76 --> 3045.18]  But then, of course, there's another one soon after and another one soon after that.
[3045.60 --> 3049.70]  And no, so Jesus, we must make time for him.
[3051.56 --> 3056.36]  Give yourself space to be at his feet.
[3057.04 --> 3059.90]  To listen to his words.
[3060.74 --> 3066.76]  To let them change who you are and how you live.
[3066.76 --> 3072.60]  That is God's will for us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[3076.60 --> 3078.92]  Now, we're in a Christian Reformed church now.
[3079.80 --> 3085.90]  And many Sundays I attend my own Christian Reformed church, Willoughby Church in Langley.
[3087.64 --> 3096.26]  And one of the things that makes me happy and one of the things to be kind of proud to be Christian Reformed is World Renew.
[3096.76 --> 3100.52]  Now, World Renew is our relief and development organization.
[3100.86 --> 3104.68]  It works across the world with partners across the world.
[3105.08 --> 3108.18]  And to address problems like illiteracy.
[3109.04 --> 3111.88]  And HIV AIDS.
[3112.40 --> 3115.12]  And infant and newborn care.
[3115.82 --> 3117.40]  And hunger.
[3117.40 --> 3121.12]  And when there's a disaster somewhere in the world.
[3121.12 --> 3123.94]  A flood or a fire or an earthquake.
[3124.30 --> 3128.12]  They partner with people to bring in emergency supplies.
[3128.90 --> 3133.72]  And after a while to bring in all those people with their green t-shirts to help with the rebuilding.
[3134.18 --> 3136.54]  It's a wonderful project.
[3136.82 --> 3139.24]  This thing we call World Renew.
[3139.24 --> 3143.70]  It does a lot of Martha stuff.
[3144.90 --> 3149.64]  It's worried and upset about this world.
[3150.16 --> 3153.08]  And the pain that so many have to live with in this world.
[3153.34 --> 3156.64]  And the poverty that so many have to live with in this world.
[3157.20 --> 3159.92]  And it wants to bring help.
[3161.28 --> 3162.34]  Now, would Jesus approve?
[3162.34 --> 3164.16]  Of course Jesus would approve.
[3165.24 --> 3169.66]  He wants us to be his hands and his arms in the world.
[3171.86 --> 3176.18]  But he would also say that it is so much better.
[3177.18 --> 3179.78]  When all of this is done.
[3180.78 --> 3184.24]  In my spirit.
[3184.98 --> 3186.66]  And in my way.
[3186.66 --> 3190.76]  So those literacy teachers.
[3191.22 --> 3192.52]  It would be so much better.
[3192.86 --> 3197.28]  When they know the mind and the heart of Jesus.
[3198.22 --> 3201.56]  People providing the infant and newborn care.
[3201.98 --> 3203.68]  It would be so much better.
[3203.92 --> 3206.60]  If they worked in the spirit of Jesus.
[3206.78 --> 3209.74]  All those people in their green t-shirts.
[3210.70 --> 3210.98]  You know.
[3211.30 --> 3213.90]  Their work would be so much more powerful.
[3213.90 --> 3217.32]  It's so much more powerful.
[3217.32 --> 3220.58]  When they reflect the heart of Jesus.
[3220.98 --> 3222.58]  When they are Christ-like.
[3224.20 --> 3228.68]  And share his love in tangible ways.
[3231.20 --> 3235.28]  So this is the lesson we have here.
[3235.44 --> 3239.14]  That yes, we can be busy in the world.
[3239.14 --> 3244.12]  But to really, really make that work.
[3244.36 --> 3246.14]  Truly the work of Christ.
[3246.72 --> 3249.32]  We need to learn the heart of Jesus.
[3249.78 --> 3251.26]  And the mind of Jesus.
[3251.74 --> 3253.84]  To take that into ourselves.
[3254.22 --> 3256.22]  And then take it out into the world.
[3260.60 --> 3264.48]  Now, you may live a quiet life these days.
[3264.48 --> 3268.30]  Your busy years may be behind you.
[3269.38 --> 3273.08]  Or you may have an extremely busy life right now.
[3273.36 --> 3276.38]  Your calendar is chock full of notes.
[3276.74 --> 3280.64]  Your phone is beeping notices all day.
[3280.98 --> 3282.10]  And into the evening.
[3282.50 --> 3284.74]  There's always more to do.
[3284.86 --> 3286.60]  So much to do.
[3286.60 --> 3289.38]  And so much of it is so important.
[3289.62 --> 3290.62]  And so necessary.
[3292.14 --> 3294.58]  I believe Jesus would understand.
[3295.60 --> 3297.32]  But he would insist.
[3297.58 --> 3300.78]  You must make time for me.
[3302.18 --> 3304.60]  Spend time in my presence.
[3305.88 --> 3308.38]  Listen to the words I have given you.
[3309.42 --> 3311.34]  Take them into your hearts.
[3311.34 --> 3314.98]  And then put them into your hands.
[3315.18 --> 3316.94]  And take them into the world.
[3318.30 --> 3320.24]  That is God's will for us.
[3320.80 --> 3322.40]  In Christ Jesus our Lord.
[3323.02 --> 3324.04]  Let's pray together.
[3325.38 --> 3329.28]  Dear Jesus, you taught us the way of compassion.
[3330.56 --> 3333.74]  You told us that we should feed the hungry.
[3333.92 --> 3335.12]  Give drink to the thirsty.
[3335.48 --> 3336.76]  Clothe the naked.
[3336.92 --> 3338.34]  Visit those who are sick in prison.
[3338.46 --> 3341.06]  Lord, you commanded us to be busy.
[3341.34 --> 3347.76]  And yet Lord, you also want us to spend time in your presence.
[3348.52 --> 3349.46]  At your feet.
[3350.48 --> 3350.96]  Learning.
[3352.18 --> 3353.20]  Growing deeper.
[3354.58 --> 3354.96]  Richer.
[3355.06 --> 3356.78]  Becoming richer in spirit.
[3358.04 --> 3362.70]  Lord, give us the way, the time, and the will for such things.
[3362.80 --> 3364.22]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[3364.94 --> 3365.22]  Amen.
[3365.22 --> 3365.36]  Amen.
[3371.34 --> 3372.38]  Amen.
[3385.38 --> 3392.02]  Jesus, all for Jesus.
[3392.52 --> 3399.02]  Jesus, all I am and have.
[3399.02 --> 3403.20]  and ever known to be.
[3405.06 --> 3412.90]  All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans,
[3412.90 --> 3421.46]  I surrender these into your hands.
[3421.46 --> 3430.18]  For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3430.18 --> 3440.82]  For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3441.76 --> 3448.38]  Jesus, all for Jesus,
[3448.38 --> 3457.56]  All I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3460.56 --> 3467.08]  Jesus, all for Jesus,
[3467.08 --> 3476.38]  All I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3478.38 --> 3486.90]  All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans,
[3487.56 --> 3495.40]  I surrender these into your hands.
[3495.40 --> 3504.58]  For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3504.58 --> 3514.92]  For it's only in your will that I am free.
[3516.76 --> 3522.76]  Jesus, all for Jesus,
[3522.76 --> 3532.14]  All I am and have and ever hope to be.
[3532.14 --> 3533.48]  Him and ever look to be.
[3533.48 --> 3541.24]  Am I and ever hope to be."
[3541.32 --> 3549.26]  Him and ever hope to be.
[3549.50 --> 3550.46]  Amen, just pray...
[3550.46 --> 3575.44]  We always have the privilege together as a body of Christ to come to him, to give him thanks, and to bring to him our needs.
[3575.44 --> 3584.06]  And so this morning, let's do that together in communal prayer.
[3584.88 --> 3586.14]  Please pray with me.
[3589.20 --> 3593.72]  Lord of the heavens and the earth, you are holy and true.
[3594.72 --> 3599.36]  You are just and merciful, gentle yet all-powerful.
[3599.36 --> 3605.08]  You are worthy to receive all praise from every creature on land and sea.
[3606.22 --> 3610.66]  Our minds are unable to comprehend your greatness and your infinite compassion.
[3611.94 --> 3614.84]  You see all that goes on in our lives.
