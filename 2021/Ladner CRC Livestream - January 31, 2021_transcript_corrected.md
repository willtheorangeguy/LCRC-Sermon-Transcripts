[240.00 → 245.14] Well, good morning to all of you looking in on our YouTube channel.
[245.14 → 246.88] This is the Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[246.88 → 253.48] It's the 31st of January, and we welcome you to join with us this morning.
[253.48 → 259.68] If you are a regular attender or member at this church, welcome back.
[259.68 → 264.76] Rest assured, it's as gray out there here as it is at your house.
[264.76 → 267.26] I tried to pick a bright tie this morning.
[267.26 → 270.36] Cora was nice enough to bring along some beautiful roses.
[270.36 → 275.20] We do our best to brighten up the day here, but the Lord is here, and we can be thankful
[275.20 → 276.20] for that.
[276.20 → 278.54] He's joining with us this morning.
[278.54 → 281.98] If you are a visitor here, join with us.
[281.98 → 283.60] Sing with us.
[283.60 → 284.68] My name is John Smith.
[284.68 → 288.42] I'll be leading some of the early aspects of this hour.
[288.42 → 292.26] Later on, Pastor Jason True will be up here presenting his sermon.
[292.26 → 295.04] He's in the middle of a series called I Am.
[295.04 → 300.34] This morning is I Am, the Resurrection and the Life.
[300.34 → 302.98] Joining with us is Gatlin on piano.
[302.98 → 306.66] Ashley, Jason, and Harry will be our vocalists this morning.
[306.66 → 315.06] The sound and media team that you don't see are Doug and Don and Jeff.
[315.06 → 319.70] Our offering today is for the new immigrant support.
[319.70 → 324.68] Our members will understand that this provides funds to help support of two immigrant families
[324.68 → 331.34] that we have sponsored, and we are supporting them for their first year of living in Canada.
[331.34 → 333.94] Next week, the offering is for NAME.
[333.94 → 337.06] That's North American Indigenous Ministries.
[337.06 → 340.74] This is the work of Howard and Annie Johnson.
[340.74 → 350.18] Funds collected are for their ministry where they minister in three communities near Chase, BC.
[350.18 → 356.08] You can mail a check, drop off a check at the church, make an online contribution to our website.
[356.08 → 360.42] You can check our connections and the newsletter for all those details.
[360.42 → 364.36] This is a new system that's come in place beginning in January this year.
[364.36 → 371.86] The deacons have come up with a scheme of envelopes where you can actually specify multiple sources
[371.86 → 373.86] of donation on one envelope.
[373.86 → 379.44] If you're like me, once a month, I look at that envelope, fill it out for the entire month
[379.44 → 381.44] and drop it off one time here.
[381.44 → 382.44] Give it a try.
[382.44 → 384.44] I find it very convenient.
[384.44 → 388.54] But once again, thank you for all your solid and continuing support.
[390.42 → 398.10] Our call to worship this morning is a responsive litany based on Psalm 62,
[398.10 → 400.46] portions of verses 1 through 8.
[400.46 → 402.66] There's a section up here that is in bold.
[402.66 → 409.04] Please read aloud along with us when we get to that point.
[409.04 → 411.88] My soul finds rest in God alone.
[411.88 → 414.54] My salvation comes from him.
[414.54 → 418.02] Find rest, oh my soul, in God alone.
[418.02 → 421.36] My hope comes from him.
[421.36 → 425.20] He alone is my rock and my salvation.
[425.20 → 427.46] He alone is my fortress.
[427.46 → 429.60] I will not be shaken.
[429.60 → 433.24] He is my mighty rock, my refuge.
[433.24 → 436.00] Trust in him at all times, oh people.
[436.00 → 442.42] Pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.
[442.42 → 448.46] The Lord's greeting comes to us from a familiar source, Galatians 1, verses 3 to 5.
[448.46 → 454.96] Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[454.96 → 460.84] for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God
[460.84 → 467.98] and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[467.98 → 473.52] To begin our worship this morning, let me lead you in an opening prayer of adoration
[473.52 → 479.32] and asking for God's presence with us this morning.
[479.32 → 480.60] Pray with me.
[480.60 → 486.26] Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the earth and the universe.
[486.26 → 491.58] You have made all creation and made that work known to us so that we can worship and honour
[491.58 → 500.58] you and that we do here today in this place and in this town and with our Christian brothers
[500.58 → 502.92] and sisters worldwide.
[502.92 → 508.34] As we prepare for worship, we pray that you will quiet our hearts, that we may hear your
[508.34 → 514.50] voice in your word and in the words of your servant Jason.
[514.50 → 520.04] We pray that you will stir our hearts, that we may more faithfully follow Jesus and that
[520.04 → 525.52] you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer you.
[525.52 → 529.08] Bless those of us who lead in worship with your spirit.
[529.08 → 534.88] May our worship today be one more step in offering our entire lives to you.
[534.88 → 537.98] Unite us with your whole church throughout the world.
[537.98 → 544.10] We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Spirit is one and
[544.10 → 547.04] only God.
[547.04 → 554.04] Let's continue with some songs of praise beginning with Everlasting God.

[1041.32 → 1044.38] Every vow we've broken
[1044.38 → 1046.20] and betrayed.
[1046.20 → 1052.20] You are the faithful one
[1052.88 → 1056.20] And from the garden
[1056.20 → 1059.20] to the grave.
[1060.02 → 1062.20] Bind us together
[1063.02 → 1066.62] We shall all
[1066.62 → 1070.64] We will feast
[1070.64 → 1074.14] in the house of Zion
[1074.14 → 1078.28] We will sing with our hearts
[1078.28 → 1079.80] Restored.
[1080.30 → 1082.70] His time made things
[1082.70 → 1085.96] We will say together
[1085.96 → 1089.02] We will feast
[1089.02 → 1091.96] and weep no more.
[1091.96 → 1105.16] For our time of confession and assurance this morning, I thought about some words of the Old Testament events.
[1105.16 → 1122.98] First, as words of confession, we have words inspired by 1 Kings 8 verses 23 and 24. This is the occasion of King Solomon's prayer of dedication for the new temple.
[1122.98 → 1136.80] This litany was written by Reverend Quentin Chin.
[1136.80 → 1166.78] We profess that you are God, O Holy One. We have no other gods, and yet we do not always serve you with sincerity and faithfulness. Our other gods are not the ones of our ancestors, the one beyond the river or in Egypt or of the Ammonites. We struggle with the other gods here and now who seek to fulfill us by consumerism and with self-importance.
[1166.78 → 1188.78] We hear gods who instill in us such fear of our enemies that we seek power from weapons of destruction. Help us, O God, to find fulfillment in you. Forgive us when we are skeptical of love's transforming power. We repent of our sins and turn our hearts again to you.
[1188.78 → 1190.78] We repent of our sins and turn our hearts again to you.
[1190.78 → 1200.78] Our assurance of God's pardon that God does hear our admission of failures is inspired by 1 Kings 19.
[1200.78 → 1207.78] Here is where Elijah meets God at Mount Sinai. These words are written by Catherine Hawker.
[1207.78 → 1231.78] Hear the good news of God's love for us, not in the earthquake, not in the storms, not in the mighty deeds, but in the silence, in the gentle touch, in the quiet rain. God says again, you are my beloved. I love you. Thanks be to God.
[1231.78 → 1236.42] Thanks be to God. Our song of response is, oh, praise the name.
[1236.42 → 1238.42] God bless you.
[1238.42 → 1239.42] Amen.
[1239.42 → 1240.42] Amen.
[1240.42 → 1242.42] Amen.
[1242.42 → 1245.42] Thanks be to God.
[1249.34 → 1254.42] Amen.
[1255.48 → 1257.04] Amen.
[1257.04 → 1278.86] I cast my mind to Calvary, where Jesus blood had died for me.
[1278.86 → 1291.20] I see His wounds, His hands, His feet, my Saviour on that cursed tree.
[1294.54 → 1307.16] His body bound and drenched in tears, they laid Him down in Joseph's tomb.
[1307.16 → 1320.16] The entrance sealed by heavy storm, Messiah still and all alone.
[1320.16 → 1330.16] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1330.16 → 1336.16] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1336.16 → 1343.16] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1343.16 → 1349.16] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1349.16 → 1351.16] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1351.16 → 1364.16] And on the third and break of dawn, the Son of heaven rose in vain.
[1364.16 → 1370.16] Oh, temple dead, where is it to sing?
[1370.16 → 1377.16] The angels roared for Christ the King.
[1377.16 → 1387.16] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1387.16 → 1393.16] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1393.16 → 1395.16] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1395.16 → 1396.16] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1396.16 → 1400.16] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1400.16 → 1405.16] Oh, Lord, oh, my God.
[1405.16 → 1415.16] Oh, praise Him.
[1415.16 → 1422.16] Oh, praise His name forever, O Lord our God.
[1422.16 → 1434.32] Till I will rise among the saints, my gaze transposed on Jesus' face.
[1434.32 → 1450.32] O praise the name of the Lord our God, O praise His name forevermore.
[1450.32 → 1463.32] For endless days we will sing Your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1463.32 → 1477.32] O Lord, O Lord our God, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1484.32 → 1486.32] Good morning, friends.
[1486.32 → 1492.32] And today we're going to continue, as John has told us, in our sermon series looking at
[1492.32 → 1496.32] the I Am sayings of Jesus in the Gospel of John.
[1496.32 → 1501.32] And so there are seven I Am sayings that we find in the Gospel
[1501.32 → 1506.32] where Jesus is describing Himself using metaphorical language
[1506.32 → 1511.32] in order to give us a deeper understanding of who He is
[1511.32 → 1516.32] and what it is He brings into our own lives.
[1516.32 → 1521.32] And today we're going to look at John chapter 11 where Jesus famously says,
[1521.32 → 1525.32] I am the resurrection and the life.
[1525.32 → 1533.32] And so we're picking up at verse 17, kind of in the middle of the chapter.
[1533.32 → 1539.32] So I want to orient you to what's happening first leading up to verse 17.
[1539.32 → 1545.32] So at the beginning of John chapter 11, we learn that one of Jesus' best friends,
[1545.32 → 1549.32] it's this man named Lazarus, has become sick.
[1549.32 → 1554.32] And upon hearing the news where He receives this message,
[1554.32 → 1556.32] the one whom you love is sick,
[1556.32 → 1559.32] Jesus actually does this very mysterious thing.
[1559.32 → 1562.32] He stays where He is.
[1562.32 → 1567.32] He actually doesn't go to be with His friend.
[1567.32 → 1571.32] He doesn't rush ahead to go and heal Him.
[1571.32 → 1576.32] So then a few days later, we hear that Lazarus actually dies,
[1576.32 → 1585.32] leaving his two sisters, Mary and Martha, grieving and wondering where in the world is Jesus?
[1585.32 → 1588.32] Like, why didn't He come?
[1588.32 → 1590.32] And so that's where we're at in this text.
[1590.32 → 1595.32] So we will be reading John chapter 11, verses 17 to 44.
[1595.32 → 1597.32] It's a bit of a longer passage.
[1597.32 → 1599.32] We have it here on the screen for us.
[1600.32 → 1606.32] On His arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
[1606.32 → 1609.32] Now, Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
[1609.32 → 1614.32] and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
[1614.32 → 1620.32] When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him.
[1620.32 → 1623.32] But Mary stayed at home.
[1623.32 → 1626.32] Lord, Martha said to Jesus,
[1626.32 → 1630.32] If you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[1630.32 → 1634.32] But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.
[1634.32 → 1638.32] Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.
[1638.32 → 1645.32] Martha answered, I know He will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
[1645.32 → 1650.32] Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.
[1650.32 → 1654.32] The one who believes in me will live even though they die.
[1654.32 → 1658.32] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[1658.32 → 1660.32] Do you believe this?
[1660.32 → 1662.32] Yes, Lord, she replied.
[1662.32 → 1667.32] I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.
[1667.32 → 1673.32] After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside.
[1673.32 → 1677.32] The teacher is here, she said, and is asking for you.
[1677.32 → 1681.32] When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
[1681.32 → 1687.32] Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.
[1687.32 → 1694.32] When the Jews, who had been with Mary in the house comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out,
[1694.32 → 1699.32] they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
[1699.32 → 1706.32] When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said,
[1706.32 → 1711.32] Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[1711.32 → 1718.32] When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping,
[1718.32 → 1721.32] He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
[1721.32 → 1724.32] Where have you laid Him? He asked.
[1724.32 → 1726.32] Come and see, Lord, they replied.
[1726.32 → 1728.32] Jesus wept.
[1728.32 → 1732.32] Then the Jews said, see how He loved Him.
[1732.32 → 1741.32] But some of them said, how couldn't He who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?
[1741.32 → 1745.32] Jesus once more deeply moved came to the tomb.
[1745.32 → 1748.32] It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
[1748.32 → 1751.32] Take away the stone, He said.
[1751.32 → 1759.32] But Lord, said Martha, the sister of the dead man, by this time there is a bad odour, for he has been there four days.
[1759.32 → 1764.32] Then Jesus said, did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?
[1764.32 → 1766.32] So they took away the stone.
[1766.32 → 1772.32] Then Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
[1772.32 → 1781.32] I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.
[1781.32 → 1787.32] When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out.
[1787.32 → 1794.32] The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face.
[1794.32 → 1799.32] Jesus said to them, take off the grave cloths and let him go.
[1799.32 → 1805.32] This is the word of the Lord.
[1805.32 → 1808.32] Let's pray together.
[1808.32 → 1812.32] Father, you are the God of the dead and of the living.
[1812.32 → 1818.32] You are the God who has come to bring life into this world that is broken by sin.
[1818.32 → 1825.32] And Lord, this morning we ask that as we open up your word together, that you would bring your life into our hearts.
[1825.32 → 1831.32] Our hearts that struggle to believe and trust in you.
[1831.32 → 1844.32] And Lord, as we read your passage and as we see who Jesus is, Lord, would you strengthen us to know you and to trust you and to believe with you by the work of your Holy Spirit in us.
[1844.32 → 1847.32] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1847.32 → 1855.32] So, two summers ago I took a class at Regent College on the great Christian poet, George Herbert.
[1855.32 → 1865.32] He was, he's known as one of the great poets of the Christian life, writing about both the lows and the highs of faith.
[1865.32 → 1870.32] So he was a poet, he was a priest, born in 1593 in England.
[1870.32 → 1872.32] He was a contemporary with Shakespeare.
[1872.32 → 1875.32] That helps us to kind of get a sense of when he lived.
[1875.32 → 1878.32] And he had a fascinating life.
[1878.32 → 1887.32] He grew up in an aristocratic family, later went to Cambridge to study, and then later in Cambridge held a very high position in the university.
[1887.32 → 1896.32] He was the public order where he would represent the university, kind of even doing international relations, and gave speeches before kings.
[1896.32 → 1901.32] But he was hardly a happy man.
[1901.32 → 1906.32] Far from it, in fact, even from a young age, he knew death.
[1906.32 → 1908.32] His father died when he was three.
[1908.32 → 1911.32] Later his mother died and many of his good friends.
[1911.32 → 1917.32] And George Herbert was sick for most of his life with tuberculosis.
[1917.32 → 1922.32] He often wrote in letters that he felt to be on death's door.
[1922.32 → 1929.32] And he actually died just before he turned 40.
[1929.32 → 1935.32] And in his poetry, he often wrestled with this reality of suffering.
[1935.32 → 1941.32] The kind of suffering that causes us to cry out to God and ask, where is God?
[1941.32 → 1947.32] And so I want to share with you a poem that he wrote entitled, The Search.
[1947.32 → 1950.32] So just two stanzas from it.
[1950.32 → 1956.32] Wither, O whither art thou fled, my Lord, my love?
[1956.32 → 1961.32] My searches are my daily bread, yet never prove.
[1961.32 → 1972.32] I sent a sigh to seek thee out, deep drawn in pain, winged like an arrow, but my scout returns in vain.
[1972.32 → 1977.32] Wither are thou, Lord, right?
[1977.32 → 1979.32] So where are you, Lord?
[1979.32 → 1980.32] Right?
[1980.32 → 1986.32] And it's a phrase, a cry uttered in deep pain and anguish.
[1986.32 → 1989.32] I know many of you have asked this question before.
[1989.32 → 1992.32] I think all of us have at one time or another.
[1992.32 → 1998.32] Some of you might even be asking that question in this particular season of your life.
[1998.32 → 2004.32] And amidst our common experience of suffering and death in this life, we have to ask ourselves,
[2004.32 → 2012.32] where do we find the resources to actually walk through these trials of life that are often marked by suffering and death?
[2012.32 → 2019.32] Because if the Christian faith that we proclaim has no resources to offer, right?
[2019.32 → 2025.32] If it has nothing to say about suffering and death, then his credibility is lacking, isn't it?
[2025.32 → 2035.32] But for centuries, Christians have been known as people who stand in the face of death and proclaim the mystery of faith.
[2035.32 → 2041.32] That Christ has died, Christ is risen, and Christ will come again.
[2041.32 → 2053.32] And so what I want us to do this morning is I just want to point out really the substance of our faith by first, or just observing two movements of Jesus in this text.
[2053.32 → 2061.32] So first I want us to look at the movement of Jesus toward us in our suffering to comfort us.
[2061.32 → 2068.32] And then secondly, his movement toward death, to conquer death, and to bring life.
[2068.32 → 2071.32] And then we'll end with a couple of points of application.
[2071.32 → 2079.32] So our first main point here is I want us to look at how Jesus moves toward us to comfort us in our suffering.
[2079.32 → 2095.32] So one thing to notice in the passage is, you know, as we mentioned, kind of the length of time between when Jesus receives the message that Lazarus is dying, and when Jesus actually arrives.
[2095.32 → 2101.32] Right? When Jesus first gets the note that Lazarus is sick, he doesn't go right away.
[2101.32 → 2104.32] He waits for two days.
[2104.32 → 2109.32] And then in verse 17, when Jesus finally arrives, it says,
[2109.32 → 2113.32] Lazarus has already been in the tomb for four days.
[2113.32 → 2121.32] And we can sense the pain and the desperation of the sisters during those days of waiting.
[2121.32 → 2122.32] Right?
[2122.32 → 2131.32] Perhaps we can even imagine them, you know, walking to the door of the house, kind of peering out the door, scanning the horizon, searching for Jesus,
[2131.32 → 2134.32] thinking, you know, maybe he's on his way.
[2134.32 → 2136.32] Maybe he's just around the corner.
[2136.32 → 2138.32] Maybe he's over the hill.
[2138.32 → 2144.32] Maybe he's going to come right at the last possible moment and save the day.
[2144.32 → 2148.32] But then Lazarus dies.
[2148.32 → 2149.32] Right?
[2149.32 → 2151.32] Jesus didn't show up.
[2151.32 → 2155.32] There's no miracle coming for Mary and Martha.
[2155.32 → 2159.32] You know, and many of you know this personally,
[2159.32 → 2169.32] that there is this testing of faith for those who stand or sit at the bedside of a dying person.
[2169.32 → 2171.32] And we hear it in their words.
[2171.32 → 2172.32] Right?
[2172.32 → 2176.32] Both Mary and Martha say the same thing to Jesus when he finally gets there.
[2176.32 → 2180.32] They say, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.
[2180.32 → 2181.32] Right?
[2181.32 → 2186.32] And is that not the quintessential question that we ask in our own pain and suffering?
[2186.32 → 2189.32] Where are you, Lord?
[2189.32 → 2191.32] God, where are you?
[2191.32 → 2201.32] And with each of these women, I want us to notice how Jesus compassionately enters into their suffering.
[2201.32 → 2203.32] And we see this in two different ways.
[2203.32 → 2206.32] First, in response to Martha.
[2206.32 → 2207.32] Martha.
[2207.32 → 2212.32] Jesus offers his assurances, the assurance of his promises.
[2212.32 → 2216.32] So in verse 21, Martha goes out to meet Jesus.
[2216.32 → 2220.32] And she says, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[2220.32 → 2231.32] And then in response, in verses 25 and 26, Jesus gives her this assurance where he says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[2231.32 → 2236.32] The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.
[2236.32 → 2239.32] Whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[2239.32 → 2243.32] And then he asks her, do you believe this?
[2243.32 → 2246.32] It's an amazing question.
[2246.32 → 2248.32] Do you believe this?
[2248.32 → 2259.32] And in this brief interaction, we're reminded that more often than not, in the Bible, we don't get answers to our questions as much as we get promises.
[2259.32 → 2269.32] And so with her brother in the tomb, Jesus stands before Martha and he basically asks her, do you believe me now?
[2269.32 → 2270.32] Right?
[2270.32 → 2272.32] Like it was easy before.
[2272.32 → 2278.32] It was a lot easier when everything was going okay, when there was no one sick or dying.
[2278.32 → 2282.32] It was a lot easier when everything was good.
[2282.32 → 2285.32] But death changes things.
[2285.32 → 2288.32] Do you still believe me?
[2288.32 → 2290.32] Jesus asks.
[2290.32 → 2297.32] You know, death forces faith to have to go to deeper depths.
[2297.32 → 2302.32] It forces faith to have to kind of climb to new levels of maturity.
[2302.32 → 2306.32] Jesus tells Martha, your brother will rise again.
[2306.32 → 2313.32] You know, and of course, Martha doesn't quite understand exactly what Jesus is promising and what he's going to do.
[2313.32 → 2319.32] So she makes this reference to her confidence that yes, in the end, her brother will rise again at the final resurrection.
[2319.32 → 2323.32] But she is showing her faith in Jesus.
[2323.32 → 2324.32] She is trusting him.
[2324.32 → 2332.32] And I love here what Mary and Martha and the disciples in the story, you know, they don't understand what Jesus is doing.
[2332.32 → 2337.32] They don't have perfect faith, but they have enough.
[2337.32 → 2338.32] Right?
[2338.32 → 2339.32] They trust Jesus.
[2339.32 → 2340.32] They believe in him.
[2340.32 → 2348.32] You know, in Christians, we are people who stake our lives on the promises of God.
[2348.32 → 2360.32] And here, Jesus is moving toward Martha in her suffering, offering her the assurance of his promise that he is the resurrection and the life.
[2360.32 → 2361.32] Right?
[2361.32 → 2370.32] And he says, basically, if you have me, if you believe in me, if you trust in me, that's enough to conquer death.
[2370.32 → 2376.32] But not only does he offer the assurance of his promises, though, secondly, he offers the comfort of his presence.
[2376.32 → 2381.32] And we see this in his interaction with the other sister, Mary.
[2381.32 → 2389.32] So in beginning in verse 28, we see one of the most beautiful interactions between Jesus and another person in the Bible.
[2389.32 → 2396.32] And so knowing that Mary is suffering deeply, Jesus calls her to come to him.
[2396.32 → 2399.32] And he desires for her to be with him.
[2399.32 → 2401.32] He wants to comfort her.
[2401.32 → 2403.32] And so she runs to him.
[2403.32 → 2408.32] And when she comes to him, she collapses on the ground in front of him, and she is weeping.
[2408.32 → 2418.32] And in the presence of Jesus, right, in the presence of God, in the flesh, directly at his feet, she cries out, where were you?
[2418.32 → 2423.32] And did you notice how Jesus responds to her cry?
[2423.32 → 2425.32] You know, he doesn't say, how dare you?
[2425.32 → 2427.32] Talk to me like that.
[2427.32 → 2428.32] Right?
[2428.32 → 2431.32] He doesn't say, how dare you question the sovereignty of God?
[2431.32 → 2433.32] He doesn't do that.
[2433.32 → 2435.32] It says he wept with her.
[2435.32 → 2436.32] Right?
[2436.32 → 2438.32] He is tender.
[2438.32 → 2441.32] God weeps with his people in their suffering.
[2441.32 → 2442.32] Right?
[2442.32 → 2445.32] And that is so amazing.
[2445.32 → 2450.32] You know, and notice Jesus knows what he's going to do.
[2450.32 → 2455.32] He knows that he's about to raise Lazarus from the dead.
[2455.32 → 2461.32] He's about to take this weeping, this sad day, and he's going to turn it into joy.
[2461.32 → 2467.32] And yet, he doesn't diminish the pain that Mary and Martha are feeling.
[2468.32 → 2471.32] He stops, and he weeps with Mary.
[2472.32 → 2476.32] Because death made Jesus feel what all of us feel.
[2476.32 → 2478.32] That something has gone wrong.
[2478.32 → 2479.32] Right?
[2479.32 → 2482.32] That we were not made for a world like this.
[2482.32 → 2485.32] So, Jesus wept.
[2485.32 → 2489.32] Friends, that is the God that you have.
[2489.32 → 2497.32] You know, and I think it's so easy, it's not easy, for us to know who God is.
[2497.32 → 2498.32] Right?
[2498.32 → 2507.32] It's not easy for us to get a sense of what he's like or what his posture toward us is when we are suffering.
[2507.32 → 2511.32] But in this passage, we see Jesus, and we learn that God actually weeps with people.
[2511.32 → 2514.32] And he comforts us with his presence.
[2514.32 → 2518.32] You know, in Jesus, God has entered into our suffering.
[2518.32 → 2521.32] He has entered into the mire and muck of this world.
[2522.32 → 2526.32] And the ultimate expression of this is his own suffering.
[2527.32 → 2528.32] Right?
[2528.32 → 2529.32] His crucifixion and his death.
[2530.32 → 2535.32] And so, I love what John Stott writes in his book, The Cross of Christ.
[2536.32 → 2538.32] So, I want to read this quote to you.
[2538.32 → 2539.32] He says,
[2539.32 → 2569.32] 
[2569.32 → 2570.32] The Cross.
[2570.32 → 2571.32] Right?
[2571.32 → 2573.32] And so, friends, when it comes to death,
[2574.32 → 2580.32] Jesus, God, does not ask of us anything that he does not accept for himself.
[2581.32 → 2582.32] Right?
[2582.32 → 2590.32] The dying and the rising of Lazarus is a clear foreshadowing that soon, Jesus is also going to die and rise again.
[2590.32 → 2591.32] Right?
[2591.32 → 2597.32] So, Jesus is not only prepared to raise Lazarus from death, he is prepared to enter into death itself.
[2597.32 → 2609.32] You know, and so for each of us, you know, in our own time, as we face our own mortality or the mortality of others, we can know that God did as well.
[2609.32 → 2610.32] Right?
[2610.32 → 2615.32] As we face the death of loved ones, we know that God did as well.
[2615.32 → 2616.32] Right?
[2616.32 → 2618.32] God knows what it's like to lose a son.
[2619.32 → 2624.32] And God doesn't ask of us anything that he did not accept on himself.
[2624.32 → 2629.32] In his death, Jesus made the sufferings of the world his own.
[2629.32 → 2630.32] Right?
[2630.32 → 2639.32] He moves toward us to comfort us in our suffering by assuring us of his promises and by comforting us with his presence.
[2639.32 → 2643.32] Okay, so that's the first movement that we see in this passage.
[2643.32 → 2647.32] But now there's a second movement of Jesus in this passage.
[2647.32 → 2654.32] So not only does he enter into our suffering to comfort us, but he comes to conquer death and bring life.
[2656.32 → 2660.32] You know, the Bible teaches us that we were not made for death.
[2660.32 → 2662.32] That death is unnatural.
[2662.32 → 2665.32] We were made for life with God.
[2665.32 → 2671.32] We were made for this life of flourishing and wholeness and delight with God.
[2671.32 → 2673.32] That's how we were made.
[2673.32 → 2676.32] But the Bible also teaches us that we rejected God.
[2676.32 → 2683.32] We sinned against him, and we turned away from our life with God that we had, and we turned toward death.
[2683.32 → 2691.32] And so as a result of that, we suffer spiritual death because we are estranged from God who is our life.
[2691.32 → 2703.32] And we suffer also then with disordered hearts, with sick bodies, broken relationships, and a corrupted world that ultimately ends in death.
[2703.32 → 2713.32] But God, because he loves you and he loves the world, he promised to come and deliver us from our captivity to death.
[2713.32 → 2721.32] And the story of the whole Bible is actually the story of God coming to bring life into the whole world and to his people again.
[2721.32 → 2728.32] But it's not until we see Jesus that we see the fullness of the life that God intends to bring.
[2728.32 → 2738.32] And that's why throughout the whole, you know, the accounts, the gospels of Jesus' life, we see him regularly coming into contact with people who are suffering,
[2738.32 → 2744.32] with the lame, with the blind, with the deaf, with the unclean, with the sick, and even with the dead.
[2744.32 → 2751.32] And one of the signs that demonstrates who Jesus is, the nature of the kingdom that he came to bring,
[2751.32 → 2757.32] is that suffering is undone wherever Jesus goes.
[2757.32 → 2769.32] Right? Jesus, you know, the blind see, the lame walk, the unclean are made clean, the sick is made well, and even the dead are raised to life.
[2769.32 → 2776.32] That is the effect Jesus has on people. He brings life and healing.
[2776.32 → 2779.32] The Bible says that death is our last enemy.
[2779.32 → 2784.32] It is not natural, it is destructive to the world that God has created.
[2784.32 → 2789.32] And that's why Jesus says in this passage, I am the resurrection and the life.
[2789.32 → 2794.32] He says, I didn't come into this world just to inspire you, I came to resurrect you.
[2794.32 → 2801.32] I didn't come just to improve your life, I came to give you a completely new life.
[2801.32 → 2804.32] Right? He says, I am the God who makes all things new.
[2804.32 → 2811.32] I am the God who takes dead things, resurrects them, and gives new life.
[2811.32 → 2814.32] Friends, this is what we see happening in this passage.
[2814.32 → 2823.32] Right? We're told several times in our passage that Jesus was deeply moved by what is going on.
[2823.32 → 2828.32] In verse 33 it says, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
[2828.32 → 2835.32] And in verse 38 it says, Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb.
[2835.32 → 2848.32] So now, the Greek word translated deeply moved is a word that the commentators often tell us refers to the snorting of a horse as they charge into battle.
[2848.32 → 2852.32] Actually, Harry just this week told me when he was a kid, I don't know if it's okay to tell,
[2852.32 → 2861.32] but he would, when there was a racetrack here in Latinx, he would kind of sneak up under the hedges and watch as the racehorses came running around the track.
[2861.32 → 2865.32] And he said he could hear the snorting, the noise of these horses.
[2865.32 → 2869.32] And you almost can't even imagine it unless you're right there.
[2869.32 → 2879.32] And it's this snorting though, this deeply moved, that suggests actually not grief, but anger.
[2879.32 → 2884.32] Okay, it suggests outrage and indignation.
[2884.32 → 2891.32] When Jesus sees Mary weeping, he feels this deep sense of outrage.
[2891.32 → 2897.32] Right? He's disturbed by what sin and death has done to the people he loves.
[2897.32 → 2904.32] In fact, he's so angry, he's about to throw it down and get into a fight.
[2904.32 → 2908.32] So in his commentary, B.B. Warfield says this,
[2908.32 → 2933.32] Right? That's awesome.
[2933.32 → 2940.32] Right? So not only is Jesus tender, but he is also a fighter.
[2940.32 → 2944.32] He has come to fight for us, not just to comfort us, but to conquer.
[2944.32 → 2952.32] Right? And Jesus confronts what the Bible elsewhere again refers to as our last enemy, death itself.
[2952.32 → 2958.32] And what is often our greatest fear and what we are all helpless to stop,
[2958.32 → 2965.32] Jesus is actually, is that, is actually powerless in the presence of Jesus.
[2965.32 → 2967.32] What does Jesus say?
[2967.32 → 2970.32] He comes to the tomb, and he says,
[2970.32 → 2972.32] Lazarus, come out.
[2972.32 → 2977.32] Right? Three words and death is reversed.
[2977.32 → 2982.32] Lazarus hears and obeys the voice of Jesus.
[2982.32 → 2984.32] He comes out, and he is alive.
[2984.32 → 2989.32] You know, another commentator, somewhat humorously, said this.
[2989.32 → 2990.32] He said,
[2990.32 → 2991.32] This is the power of Jesus.
[2991.32 → 2997.32] Whenever Jesus specifically commands someone or something, there's always a response.
[2997.32 → 3004.32] If Jesus had not been specific in calling Lazarus' name, every dead person would have walked out.
[3004.32 → 3011.32] In raising Lazarus from death to life, he is displaying his purposes.
[3011.32 → 3012.32] Right?
[3012.32 → 3017.32] He is, he intends to rid the world of all suffering and death.
[3017.32 → 3020.32] And, and to wipe every tear from every eye.
[3020.32 → 3022.32] And to make all things new.
[3022.32 → 3028.32] In raising Lazarus from the dead, we see what Jesus intends to do for the whole world.
[3028.32 → 3033.32] I want to come back to George Herbert, who I introduced to you at the beginning.
[3033.32 → 3042.32] His great hope in the midst of suffering was the cross.
[3042.32 → 3051.32] In all of these poems he wrote about affliction and suffering, he always, in those, looked to the cross.
[3051.32 → 3055.32] The reality that Christ has defeated death forever.
[3055.32 → 3058.32] So there's one more poem I want to share with you.
[3058.32 → 3060.32] It's called A Dialogue Anthem.
[3060.32 → 3065.32] And it's a dialogue between Christian and death.
[3065.32 → 3072.32] It's kind of a kind of like a, you know, a basketball game, kind of like taunt back and forth kind of thing.
[3072.32 → 3073.32] So here it is.
[3073.32 → 3074.32] Christian.
[3074.32 → 3078.32] Alas, poor death, where is thy glory?
[3078.32 → 3082.32] Where is thy famous force, thy ancient sting?
[3082.32 → 3083.32] Death.
[3083.32 → 3091.32] Also, oh, alas, poor mortal, void of story, go spell and read how I have killed thy king.
[3091.32 → 3094.32] Poor death, and who is hurt thereby?
[3094.32 → 3099.32] Thy curse being laid on him makes thee a curse.
[3099.32 → 3103.32] Let losers talk, and thou shalt die.
[3103.32 → 3106.32] These arms shall crush thee.
[3106.32 → 3109.32] Spare not to do thy worst.
[3109.32 → 3114.32] I shall one day, I shall be one day better than before.
[3114.32 → 3121.32] Thou so much worse, that thou shall be no more.
[3121.32 → 3125.32] Friends, if you belong to Jesus by faith, right?
[3125.32 → 3132.32] If you are united to him, this one who is the resurrection and the life, then your life with God is secure.
[3132.32 → 3135.32] Death has been defeated.
[3135.32 → 3140.32] And so if this is true, we have to ask ourselves, what does this mean for us today?
[3140.32 → 3141.32] Right?
[3141.32 → 3144.32] How should our lives reflect this reality?
[3144.32 → 3150.32] And so I have three application points to consider together real quickly before we finish.
[3150.32 → 3162.32] First, Christians are to be people who know how to honestly lament our own suffering and the suffering of our neighbours.
[3162.32 → 3163.32] Right?
[3163.32 → 3170.32] As Christians, we can have courage in the face of death and suffering because of our hope in Christ, that Christ has conquered death.
[3170.32 → 3175.32] But that doesn't mean we are to be silent now when we confront it.
[3175.32 → 3176.32] Right?
[3176.32 → 3179.32] God invites us to cry out to him.
[3179.32 → 3185.32] And so when we look at Jesus, right, we see the truest human being that ever lived.
[3185.32 → 3197.32] And if he wept in the presence of suffering and death, the one who has the power to undo all suffering and death, he himself wept.
[3197.32 → 3200.32] So then friends, we ought to do the same.
[3200.32 → 3201.32] Right?
[3201.32 → 3204.32] We can express the reality of suffering in this broken world.
[3206.32 → 3210.32] Secondly, we can be people who enter into the suffering of others.
[3210.32 → 3211.32] Right?
[3211.32 → 3222.32] If what Jesus says here is true, that he is the resurrection and the life, we don't have to be afraid of moving toward suffering and pain in the world and bringing comfort.
[3222.32 → 3233.32] You know, just as Jesus, he entered into the suffering of others, we can do the same because we know that Jesus will bring an end to all suffering.
[3233.32 → 3242.32] We can do the same because we have Jesus' presence with us by his Holy Spirit, empowering us to be the comfort of Jesus to a world that is suffering.
[3242.32 → 3250.32] Finally, we can be people who are eager to share the life that Jesus brings.
[3250.32 → 3251.32] Right?
[3251.32 → 3264.32] By this story, we're to understand not only that Jesus has the power to physically raise the dead, but he's also able to take us who are spiritually dead and bring us to spiritual life.
[3264.32 → 3269.32] And that, friends, is our hope for Canada, for Vancouver, for Ladder.
[3269.32 → 3276.32] Because God can speak to the spiritually dead in the same way he spoke to Lazarus to come out of the grave.
[3276.32 → 3277.32] Right?
[3277.32 → 3283.32] So whether it's death and decay, whether it's sin and skepticism, none of it is a problem for Jesus.
[3283.32 → 3286.32] The dead will hear his voice and will live.
[3286.32 → 3295.32] You know, in Paul, in Philippians 2, he talks about holding out the words of life to the world.
[3295.32 → 3299.32] So that means that we can proclaim Christ to a cynical world.
[3299.32 → 3305.32] You know, and so often we just think, spiritually, people don't have the ears to hear.
[3305.32 → 3306.32] They reject Jesus.
[3306.32 → 3308.32] They reject Christianity.
[3308.32 → 3310.32] It feels hopeless sometimes.
[3310.32 → 3313.32] But Jesus is alive and powerful.
[3313.32 → 3323.32] And the one who can raise the dead can speak and call life forth from spiritual deadness.
[3323.32 → 3328.32] Friends, I just want to read these two verses to you as we conclude.
[3328.32 → 3329.32] Jesus says,
[3329.32 → 3333.32] I am the resurrection and the life.
[3333.32 → 3338.32] The one who believes in me will live even though they die.
[3338.32 → 3342.32] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[3342.32 → 3344.32] What good news that is.
[3344.32 → 3345.32] Let's pray together.
[3345.32 → 3349.32] Let's pray together.
[3349.32 → 3351.32] Jesus, we praise you.
[3351.32 → 3353.32] You are the great God.
[3353.32 → 3356.32] You are the source of all life.
[3356.32 → 3365.32] Not only are you tender to us in our suffering, but you have promised us that you will conquer all death and suffering.
[3365.32 → 3367.32] You are the mighty God.
[3367.32 → 3369.32] And so we praise you.
[3369.32 → 3372.32] Father, we suffer.
[3372.32 → 3375.32] We love those who die.
[3375.32 → 3377.32] And would you comfort us.
[3377.32 → 3387.32] And at the same time, as you comfort and as you hear our cries, would you strengthen us in faith to know that you are the resurrection and the life.
[3387.32 → 3390.32] To take hope in you because you have defeated death.
[3390.32 → 3392.32] Lord, be with us.
[3392.32 → 3396.32] Help us to offer these words of life to the world around us.
[3396.32 → 3398.32] By your Holy Spirit, be with us.
[3398.32 → 3399.32] We pray in Jesus name.
[3399.32 → 3400.32] Amen.
[3400.32 → 3403.32] So let's sing our song of response together.
[3403.32 → 3405.32] And we will sing,
[3405.32 → 3407.32] When Peace Like a River.
[3407.32 → 3413.32] When Peace Like a River
[3413.32 → 3415.32] When Peace Like a River
[3415.32 → 3430.32] When peace like a river attended my way,
[3430.32 → 3437.32] When sorrows like sea-filled fall.
[3437.32 → 3448.32] Whatever my life Thou hast taught me to say,
[3448.32 → 3458.32] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3458.32 → 3467.32] Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
[3467.32 → 3474.32] Let this blessed assurance control.
[3474.32 → 3483.32] That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
[3483.32 → 3492.32] And has shed His own blood for my soul.
[3492.32 → 3513.32] It is well, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[3513.32 → 3522.32] My sin, O the blitz of His glorious heart,
[3522.32 → 3530.32] My sin, not in part, but the whole.
[3530.32 → 3539.32] It's failed to the cross, and I bear it no more.
[3539.32 → 3549.32] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul.
[3549.32 → 3558.32] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3558.32 → 3579.32] O Lord, praise the day, when my faith shall be sighed.
[3579.32 → 3588.32] The clouds behold, O my blood, bless the storm.
[3588.32 → 3596.32] The clouds shall resound, and the Lord shall descend.
[3596.32 → 3607.32] Even so, it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[3607.32 → 3614.10] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3614.10 → 3625.42] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3637.32 → 3645.58] So we continue to worship the Lord by coming to Him and seeking His help on the behalf
[3645.58 → 3649.64] of our world, our community, ourselves.
[3649.64 → 3653.98] First there are some things to pray for.
[3653.98 → 3659.00] Shirley Hulk's mother living in Lethbridge, Alberta passed away last Monday.
[3659.00 → 3664.46] She was 99 years old, didn't quite make it to 100 to get that letter from the Queen.
[3664.46 → 3669.98] She was grandmother to Kevin and Carolyn, great-grandmother to Adam and Ryan, Maggie and
[3669.98 → 3670.98] Owen.
[3670.98 → 3676.02] And Joe and Shirley are in Lethbridge now for her funeral.
[3676.02 → 3682.98] Kim is back from the hospital after a stay that didn't result in some planned treatments,
[3682.98 → 3687.70] but she is resting at home and able to be with immediate family, but does remain very
[3687.70 → 3690.70] sick.
[3690.70 → 3696.76] And lastly, Jake was diagnosed with COVID-19 this week.
[3696.76 → 3702.60] He reports that he is doing quite well, just suffering from some cold symptoms and is feeling
[3702.60 → 3703.88] better.
[3703.88 → 3707.26] But him and his whole family are having to self-isolate.
[3707.26 → 3712.60] And so let's take these things and others to the Lord in prayer.
[3712.60 → 3716.98] Would you pray with me?
[3716.98 → 3726.38] Heavenly Father, we come to you, a God who comforts us in our affliction, who binds up our wounds.
[3726.38 → 3728.98] You are a God of mercy.
[3728.98 → 3731.04] We praise you for who you are.
[3731.04 → 3736.00] And we see your mercy displayed most clearly on the cross.
[3736.00 → 3748.40] We praise you for you.
[3748.40 → 3764.40] We praise you for you have a plan for all creation that is unfolding before our very eyes.
[3764.40 → 3766.46] We often forget this.
[3766.46 → 3772.04] We can't see what you're doing when before us, we see so much suffering and death around
[3772.04 → 3774.10] us.
[3774.10 → 3783.52] We want things done in our own timing with our preferred plan in our own way.
[3783.52 → 3789.86] So Lord, help us to trust in you, to trust in your timing, to trust in your plan.
[3789.86 → 3796.02] Keep our hearts stayed on you, even when we don't feel that you are on the way.
[3796.02 → 3801.30] Remind us of what is true, that you are the resurrection and the life.
[3801.30 → 3805.88] Keep our eyes open so that we can see you at work.
[3805.88 → 3810.52] Send us out into the world as your people to comfort those around us.
[3810.52 → 3816.80] And Lord, because you are a God of mercy and of action, we can bring our requests before
[3816.80 → 3817.06] you.
[3817.86 → 3819.82] So we pray for the whole world.
[3820.74 → 3825.34] It seems that the whole world is sick and is waiting for your healing touch.
[3826.44 → 3828.00] So Lord, come in your mercy.
[3829.56 → 3835.34] Lord, continue to be with our leaders in politics and in medicine.
[3835.34 → 3840.72] Be with companies who are developing vaccines.
[3841.92 → 3846.30] Lord, guide all with your wisdom and with your mercy.
[3846.96 → 3847.68] Lord, have mercy.
[3849.06 → 3852.40] We pray for the hulks and the calves who have lost Shirley's mother.
[3853.32 → 3855.30] Lord, come and comfort those who mourn.
[3856.52 → 3860.36] Give them the assurance of your promises, the comfort of your presence.
[3861.54 → 3863.00] Lord, would you come in your mercy.
[3863.00 → 3867.54] Father, we lift Kim to you, O Lord.
[3868.66 → 3872.12] And we cry out to you, where are you, Lord?
[3873.22 → 3876.72] Would you be close to her and heal her, we ask.
[3876.82 → 3877.70] Be with her family.
[3879.02 → 3880.90] Lord, we ask that you would come in your mercy.
[3882.50 → 3884.24] Lord, be with Jake and Mary Ann.
[3884.36 → 3887.12] Would you heal Jake of this virus?
[3887.32 → 3890.72] And Lord, would you help him to recover from it completely?
[3890.72 → 3894.38] Lord, protect also his family from being infected.
[3895.50 → 3896.98] Lord, would you come in your mercy.
[3898.56 → 3905.28] Lord, again we lift to you all those in our own congregation, those we know and love also,
[3905.50 → 3909.50] who are lonely, cut off from loved ones.
[3909.76 → 3913.68] Lord, those who are anxious for their health and the health of others.
[3914.58 → 3917.32] Lord, for those who mourn, who have recently lost loved ones.
[3917.32 → 3920.08] Lord, be present with us, your people.
[3921.22 → 3922.38] Lord, come in your mercy.
[3923.62 → 3929.14] We pray all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, the good shepherd,
[3929.98 → 3932.90] the one who is the life and the resurrection,
[3933.62 → 3935.26] the one who is the bread of life,
[3936.08 → 3940.32] the great I am, the God who came and took on flesh.
[3940.96 → 3942.40] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3942.94 → 3943.22] Amen.
[3943.22 → 3943.30] Amen.
[3946.24 → 3951.18] So, as friends, we go out to be a blessing to the world,
[3951.24 → 3953.00] we go with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[3953.28 → 3955.98] So I invite you to hold out your hands and again receive this,
[3956.32 → 3958.60] these words of benediction from Hebrews 13.
[3958.60 → 3962.40] Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead,
[3963.12 → 3963.94] our Lord Jesus,
[3964.86 → 3966.60] the great shepherd of the sheep,
[3967.16 → 3969.02] by the blood of the eternal covenant,
[3969.20 → 3971.84] equip you with everything good that you may do his will,
[3972.56 → 3975.14] working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[3975.86 → 3976.84] through Jesus Christ,
[3976.94 → 3978.66] to whom be glory forever and ever.
[3979.58 → 3979.90] Amen.
[3979.90 → 3980.02] Amen.
[3980.02 → 3980.06] Amen.
[3988.60 → 3989.08] Amen.
[3989.08 → 3989.16] Amen.
[3989.56 → 3989.76] Amen.
[3990.14 → 3990.36] Amen.
[3994.50 → 3994.66] Amen.
[3994.66 → 3994.72] Amen.
[3995.10 → 3995.98] Amen.
[3996.34 → 3996.72] Amen.
[3998.80 → 4000.54] Amen.
[4000.56 → 4001.72] Amen.
[4002.26 → 4002.84] Amen.
[4002.84 → 4004.68] Amen.
[4004.68 → 4006.48] Amen.
[4006.48 → 4018.40] Amen.
[4018.60 → 4021.74] Jesus Christ.
[4024.56 → 4035.22] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[4037.36 → 4047.92] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[4048.60 → 4049.60] Amen.
[4050.60 → 4061.66] Friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[4063.12 → 4074.92] Friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4078.60 → 4088.60] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[4088.60 → 4101.60] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[4101.60 → 4102.60] Amen.
[4102.60 → 4103.60] Amen.
[4103.60 → 4104.60] Amen.
[4104.60 → 4106.60] Amen.
[4106.60 → 4107.60] Amen.
[4107.60 → 4108.60] Amen.
[4108.60 → 4108.70] Amen.
[4109.60 → 4110.60] Amen.
[4110.60 → 4112.60] Amen.
[4140.60 → 4142.60] Amen.
