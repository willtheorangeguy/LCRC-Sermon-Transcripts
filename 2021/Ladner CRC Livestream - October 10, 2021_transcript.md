[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 61.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 121.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 151.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 181.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 211.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 241.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  Amen.

[274.00 --> 275.00]  Amen.
[275.00 --> 276.00]  Amen.
[276.00 --> 281.00]  Hear, O Israel, God's people.
[281.00 --> 285.00]  The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[285.00 --> 290.90]  And you shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, and with all of your soul,
[290.90 --> 293.90]  and with all of your strength.
[293.90 --> 298.24]  And so it is beneath these beautiful words of the Shema that I welcome you this morning
[298.24 --> 301.74]  to worship at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[301.74 --> 306.30]  My name is Jason Truel, and I'll be guiding us through the rhythms of our worship this
[306.30 --> 307.86]  morning.
[307.86 --> 311.96]  So before we begin, I just want to make a couple of announcements.
[311.96 --> 317.96]  And so as most of you know already, we will not be collecting the offering during the worship
[317.96 --> 325.36]  service, but you can give by dropping off a check or money in the drop boxes.
[325.36 --> 327.18]  So we don't have one on the table anymore.
[327.18 --> 329.18]  We've moved them to the two doors.
[329.18 --> 331.34]  So that's where you can find them.
[331.34 --> 335.52]  Our designated offering for this morning is for World Renew.
[335.52 --> 340.84]  World Renew offers aid to people around the world who are struggling with hunger, poverty,
[340.84 --> 341.84]  and illness.
[341.84 --> 351.60]  And so this Thanksgiving, please take a moment to consider how richly blessed we are, how richly
[351.60 --> 357.78]  we have been provided for by God, and to give to those who have very little.
[357.78 --> 362.92]  And also, if there's another cause on this Thanksgiving that you would like to give to,
[363.06 --> 369.66]  you can write that on your envelope and designate that offering to a cause that we as a church support.
[369.66 --> 378.22]  Another announcement is that already for two weeks, we have started a new midweek Bible study and fellowship.
[378.34 --> 380.38]  It's actually, we're just going to keep calling it coffee break.
[380.38 --> 388.88]  So we used to have on Tuesdays a ladies Bible study, on Wednesdays coffee break Bible study, Thursdays kind of coffee clets, if you remember that.
[389.22 --> 395.28]  So what we're doing now is we're kind of taking all three of those things and putting them into one.
[395.28 --> 406.96]  So on Wednesday mornings at 9.30, you can come for a time of fellowship, bring your own coffee for now, and it's a great chance to, you know, check in with everyone, fellowship together.
[406.96 --> 411.04]  And then at 10, we'll break off into men's groups and women's groups.
[411.04 --> 412.40]  So it's coffee break expanded.
[412.40 --> 418.10]  We'll have men and women and our Chinese folks are also joining us, and we're studying the Gospel of John.
[418.10 --> 424.62]  So I invite everyone to come in, and you don't have to, like, be there every week and commit, but you can drop in anytime you're available.
[425.80 --> 435.68]  Also, a cross-training class is called This Fall Art, Beauty, and the Kingdom, and that is taking a break today, but it will resume next week.
[435.98 --> 439.86]  So please take note of our cross-training class on Sunday mornings.
[439.86 --> 446.12]  With that, let's prepare our hearts to worship the Lord this morning.
[447.34 --> 457.62]  You know, when God first nudges the human heart, and then when we follow his grace deep down into our souls to that place where we can respond to God and say,
[457.62 --> 463.80]  I believe in Jesus, one of the first things we realize is that all of life comes from God.
[463.80 --> 477.26]  Everything from creation to humanity, from work to rest, family and friends and fellowship, everything is a gift from our Father's hands.
[477.66 --> 488.52]  But it doesn't take long for us to realize it's not always hearts that are full of joy and contentment that sit down in these seats to worship God.
[488.52 --> 495.54]  We have our share of knowing the frustrations of what it means to be human.
[496.84 --> 504.16]  Sometimes it seems we are always just kind of falling short of happiness, what we think will really make us happy.
[504.94 --> 512.40]  And so when we come to worship, our heads are often bowed by what is broken.
[513.80 --> 515.84]  But we come, right?
[515.84 --> 523.36]  And we hear God's welcome to us, his call once again to his life.
[523.92 --> 530.20]  And when we hear that call, we lift up our heads because we sense the undertow of God's majesty.
[530.86 --> 536.28]  And we hear again our creator's invitation to be part of his kingdom.
[537.42 --> 539.14]  And so may it be so for us this morning.
[539.14 --> 546.10]  Will you rise with me in body and in spirit and hear the call of worship from Psalm 100?
[546.66 --> 548.12]  We'll say it responsibly.
[549.22 --> 552.02]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[552.78 --> 554.36]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[554.92 --> 558.02]  Come before him with joyful song.
[559.60 --> 561.92]  Know that the Lord is God.
[561.92 --> 590.80]  Let's pray together.
[590.80 --> 599.26]  Father in heaven, we give you thanks for life and for all of the experiences that life brings us.
[599.92 --> 605.64]  We give you thanks for joy, for hope, for peace, for prayer.
[605.64 --> 613.58]  But we also give you thanks that even in our trials, sorrows and pains that you are also with us.
[614.18 --> 624.98]  We give thanks for our land, for the beauty all around us, for the riches that it provides for the living, for the people and the cultures among us.
[625.78 --> 631.66]  Above all, Lord, we give thanks for our hope in Christ, the life and freedom that will ultimately be ours.
[631.66 --> 635.06]  Father, we gather now for worship.
[636.62 --> 640.68]  Grant us gratitude as we remember your goodness.
[641.78 --> 644.76]  Grant us repentance as we remember our sins.
[645.50 --> 648.30]  And grant us joy as we remember your love.
[649.26 --> 653.10]  Enable us to lift our hearts in prayer and praise to you this morning.
[653.10 --> 655.02]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[655.58 --> 656.22]  Amen.
[657.78 --> 664.02]  God's greeting to us comes from Colossians chapter 2, verses 6 to 7.
[664.02 --> 670.78]  So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him.
[672.06 --> 674.26]  Rooted and built up in him.
[674.84 --> 676.78]  Strengthened in the faith as you were taught.
[677.24 --> 679.66]  And overflowing with thankfulness.
[680.60 --> 685.12]  Now that God has greeted us, he has called us as one church family.
[685.20 --> 687.72]  Let's turn and let's greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[687.72 --> 687.84]  Amen.

[1204.54 --> 1214.26]  So our Father gives us all good gifts, and we respond in praise, and we respond in thanksgiving.
[1215.06 --> 1221.98]  But also we come to this time now of confession, where we come before the Lord and we confess
[1221.98 --> 1228.38]  our struggles, our sinfulness, our shame. But then we turn to our Lord Jesus,
[1228.38 --> 1235.42]  and we look to him for his forgiveness, for his mercy, and for his love that he gives to us
[1235.42 --> 1243.34]  freely through the Lord Jesus Christ. And so would you today say this prayer of confession together
[1243.34 --> 1254.38]  with me? Let's pray together. Holy God, you have given us many good gifts. Today we thank you for
[1254.38 --> 1262.62]  all of them. But we also confess that sometimes we love those gifts more than we love you.
[1263.36 --> 1274.40]  We confess wanting more and more things, food, clothes, toys, and money. Forgive us for not being
[1274.40 --> 1283.52]  content and thankful. Forgive our selfishness. Help us to love you more than everything else.
[1283.52 --> 1292.56]  we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. I want to invite you now to take a moment of silence,
[1293.10 --> 1300.18]  to come before the Lord in your own heart, thanking him for his mercy to us. Let's pray together silently.
[1300.18 --> 1329.56]  Our gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you for a moment of stillness.
[1330.18 --> 1339.94]  A moment to commune with you, to know your presence and your love for us.
[1341.00 --> 1348.10]  Father, on this Thanksgiving, we acknowledge the many blessings that you pour out upon us.
[1348.86 --> 1353.16]  And also confess, Lord, that we don't acknowledge you, that they come from you,
[1353.16 --> 1362.28]  and that all things are yours. Father, we also confess our hearts' longings for things that ultimately
[1362.28 --> 1371.30]  don't satisfy. Lord, we praise you that you are the one who satisfies us, because you have created us
[1371.30 --> 1381.32]  to be satisfied by you alone. And Father, we thank you for the freedom to draw close to you in prayer,
[1381.32 --> 1390.12]  and for the gift of being your sons and daughters through Christ our Savior. We pray in his holy name. Amen.
[1390.12 --> 1398.96]  Would you please stand with me now? And let's hear these words and say these words of assurance of pardon.
[1400.02 --> 1406.28]  Brothers and sisters, what can wash away our sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1407.28 --> 1414.28]  We are brothers and sisters through his blood. We have died together. We will rise together.
[1414.28 --> 1419.86]  We will live together. And hear these words from the book of Titus.
[1422.38 --> 1429.62]  When the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us. Not because of righteous
[1429.62 --> 1437.54]  things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal
[1437.54 --> 1445.22]  by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[1445.22 --> 1449.72]  Thanks be to God. Let's sing our song of renewal together.
[1449.72 --> 1450.32]  verse 12
[1450.32 --> 1460.86]  Oh
[1460.86 --> 1461.36]  Bud
[1461.36 --> 1461.86]  Oh
[1461.86 --> 1467.40]  How great the chasm had made between us
[1467.40 --> 1473.18]  How high the mountain I could not climb
[1473.18 --> 1478.74]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[1478.74 --> 1485.24]  And spoke your name into the night
[1485.24 --> 1490.74]  Through the darkness, your loving kindness
[1491.42 --> 1496.74]  Tore through the shadows of my soul
[1497.40 --> 1503.18]  The work is finished, the end is written
[1503.18 --> 1509.24]  Jesus Christ, my living Lord
[1509.24 --> 1517.94]  Who could imagine so great and mercy
[1517.94 --> 1524.36]  A heart that found all such countless grace
[1524.36 --> 1530.12]  The God of ages, stepped out from glory
[1530.12 --> 1536.00]  To wear my sin and bear my shame
[1536.00 --> 1541.70]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
[1541.70 --> 1547.12]  The King of kings calls me his own
[1547.80 --> 1553.38]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever
[1553.38 --> 1559.26]  Jesus Christ, my living Lord
[1559.26 --> 1566.18]  Hallelujah, praise the world, you set me free
[1566.18 --> 1572.06]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[1572.06 --> 1575.04]  You have broken every chain
[1575.04 --> 1577.88]  There's salvation in your name
[1577.88 --> 1582.92]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1582.92 --> 1592.10]  In the morning that sealed the promise
[1592.10 --> 1597.62]  Your buried body began to breathe
[1597.62 --> 1603.50]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[1603.50 --> 1609.50]  Declared the grave, there's no claim on me
[1609.50 --> 1615.80]  Then in the morning that sealed the promise
[1615.80 --> 1621.18]  Your buried body began to breathe
[1621.18 --> 1627.06]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[1627.06 --> 1633.06]  Declared the grave, there's no claim on me
[1633.06 --> 1637.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1637.06 --> 1638.06]  In the morning that sealed the promise
[1638.06 --> 1639.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1639.06 --> 1645.06]  Hallelujah, praise the world, you set me free
[1645.06 --> 1663.74]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[1663.74 --> 1669.04]  Hallelujah, praise the world, you set me free
[1669.04 --> 1674.64]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[1674.64 --> 1680.36]  You have broken every chain, where salvation in your name
[1680.36 --> 1685.78]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1685.78 --> 1691.64]  Come to all my living hope
[1691.64 --> 1697.68]  Come to all my living hope
[1704.64 --> 1718.48]  Brothers and sisters, the greatest gift
[1718.48 --> 1728.40]  There we are. Hi. The greatest gift of all the gifts that God bestows upon us
[1728.40 --> 1733.32]  is the gift of his son Jesus Christ who died on the cross
[1733.32 --> 1738.02]  giving us his life through his broken body and his shed blood
[1738.02 --> 1741.32]  And Jesus calls us to himself
[1741.32 --> 1745.32]  He calls us together as one body in Jesus
[1745.32 --> 1749.12]  And he has given us this meal
[1749.12 --> 1752.50]  to remember and to celebrate
[1752.50 --> 1754.50]  what he has done for us
[1754.50 --> 1758.64]  And as we celebrate and as we remember and as we proclaim
[1758.64 --> 1761.28]  the Lord's death until he comes again
[1761.28 --> 1764.68]  The Spirit of God is with us
[1764.68 --> 1768.92]  And the Spirit of God uses this bread and this cup
[1768.92 --> 1770.88]  to nourish us spiritually
[1770.88 --> 1773.88]  as we take it in faith
[1773.88 --> 1778.08]  So we come now to the table of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1778.08 --> 1781.94]  And Jesus does call us to feast with him
[1781.94 --> 1784.98]  This is a symbol of our future
[1784.98 --> 1788.78]  when we will feast with him at the wedding banquet of the Lamb
[1788.78 --> 1798.68]  And so this table is for those who have already put their faith in their trust in the Lord Jesus
[1798.68 --> 1801.82]  So friends, if you believe in your hearts
[1801.82 --> 1805.04]  in Jesus that he died for you
[1805.04 --> 1807.14]  that he was raised from the dead for you
[1807.14 --> 1812.50]  then Jesus invites you to come and to feast with him
[1812.50 --> 1816.04]  If you do not yet know Jesus
[1816.04 --> 1821.20]  If you have not yet fully turned your heart to him and trust
[1821.20 --> 1826.02]  If you are not yet at peace with your neighbors
[1826.02 --> 1830.96]  then please do not take the elements right now
[1830.96 --> 1838.96]  Please use this time to consider Christ's invitation of life to you
[1838.96 --> 1843.78]  So let me read these words of institution
[1843.78 --> 1846.14]  from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians
[1846.14 --> 1849.94]  We have the Mandarin
[1849.94 --> 1851.06]  but not the English
[1851.06 --> 1852.06]  I'm not sure what happened
[1852.06 --> 1853.54]  But anyway
[1853.54 --> 1855.08]  So let's see here
[1855.08 --> 1856.42]  The Lord Jesus
[1856.42 --> 1858.44]  On the night when he was betrayed
[1858.44 --> 1859.16]  he took bread
[1859.16 --> 1861.98]  And when he had given thanks to God
[1861.98 --> 1863.66]  he broke it
[1863.66 --> 1864.66]  and said
[1864.66 --> 1865.64]  This is my body
[1865.64 --> 1866.60]  which is for you
[1866.60 --> 1867.94]  Do this
[1867.94 --> 1869.32]  in remembrance of me
[1869.32 --> 1871.28]  In the same way
[1871.28 --> 1872.80]  Jesus also took the cup
[1872.80 --> 1873.88]  after supper
[1873.88 --> 1874.36]  saying
[1874.36 --> 1875.86]  This is the cup
[1875.86 --> 1878.28]  of the new covenant
[1878.28 --> 1879.78]  in my blood
[1879.78 --> 1882.68]  As often as you drink it
[1882.68 --> 1884.64]  do it in remembrance of me
[1884.64 --> 1887.16]  For as often as you eat this bread
[1887.16 --> 1888.50]  and you drink this cup
[1888.50 --> 1890.66]  you proclaim the Lord's death
[1890.66 --> 1892.72]  until he comes again
[1892.72 --> 1896.94]  So let's say this communion liturgy together as well
[1896.94 --> 1899.96]  Brothers and sisters
[1899.96 --> 1901.38]  Lift up your hearts
[1901.38 --> 1904.36]  We lift them up to the Lord
[1904.36 --> 1906.68]  We are his people
[1906.68 --> 1909.90]  We are redeemed by his grace
[1909.90 --> 1913.06]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith
[1913.06 --> 1915.24]  Christ has died
[1915.24 --> 1916.80]  Christ is risen
[1916.80 --> 1918.90]  Christ will come again
[1918.90 --> 1921.08]  Christ our Passover
[1921.08 --> 1923.30]  Passover has been sacrificed for us
[1923.30 --> 1926.58]  Therefore let us keep the feast
[1926.58 --> 1929.82]  These are the gifts of God
[1929.82 --> 1931.42]  for the people of God
[1931.42 --> 1933.92]  Feed on him in your hearts by faith
[1933.92 --> 1935.48]  Drink remembering
[1935.48 --> 1936.64]  that Christ's blood
[1936.64 --> 1938.04]  was shed for you
[1938.04 --> 1940.42]  And now
[1940.42 --> 1942.44]  I'll have to give some words of instruction
[1942.44 --> 1945.66]  Because we are coming forward
[1945.66 --> 1947.96]  Again like we did a month ago
[1947.96 --> 1949.42]  To receive the bread and wine
[1949.42 --> 1951.14]  And so
[1951.14 --> 1952.26]  What we'll do
[1952.26 --> 1954.58]  Is we'll have two stations up front
[1954.58 --> 1956.22]  One here in front of this row
[1956.22 --> 1957.70]  And one in front of the other row
[1957.70 --> 1959.80]  And there's an usher
[1959.80 --> 1960.60]  Who will
[1960.60 --> 1962.86]  Call your row to stand
[1962.86 --> 1964.62]  And then to come forward
[1964.62 --> 1967.72]  And as you wait for
[1967.72 --> 1968.90]  To be called
[1968.90 --> 1970.02]  And you can relax
[1970.02 --> 1971.60]  The usher will tell you when to come
[1971.60 --> 1972.72]  And use this time
[1972.72 --> 1975.76]  Of reflection
[1975.76 --> 1976.92]  Use this time to pray
[1976.92 --> 1979.24]  And use this time to meditate
[1979.24 --> 1981.52]  On what Christ has done
[1981.52 --> 1982.90]  To forgive you of your sins
[1982.90 --> 1983.90]  And so when you come forward
[1983.90 --> 1984.92]  And you're taking the elements
[1984.92 --> 1986.20]  That's not the time
[1986.20 --> 1987.22]  To do that
[1987.22 --> 1988.96]  Because that will kind of hold things up
[1988.96 --> 1991.42]  But do that in your seats
[1991.42 --> 1992.34]  And then when you come forward
[1992.34 --> 1993.66]  You will be offered the bread
[1993.66 --> 1994.28]  And the cup
[1994.28 --> 1995.42]  And just take them
[1995.42 --> 1997.42]  With thanksgiving in your hearts
[1997.42 --> 1999.26]  And then you will go out
[1999.26 --> 2001.22]  And go up around the side
[2001.22 --> 2002.44]  And sit back down
[2002.44 --> 2005.52]  I think that's everything
[2005.52 --> 2009.36]  So let's go ahead and begin
[2009.36 --> 2011.30]  Could we have first the elders
[2011.30 --> 2012.60]  Come forward
[2022.34 --> 2026.84]  Three minute
[2031.74 --> 2033.02]  Two close
[2033.02 --> 2034.42]  Two happy
[2034.42 --> 2035.60]  One better
[2035.60 --> 2035.74]  Two

[2036.38 --> 2036.98]  Other
[2036.98 --> 2037.32]  That your soul

[2037.80 --> 2038.44]  One better
[2038.44 --> 2038.88]  Ah
[2038.88 --> 2039.64]  That your soul
[2039.64 --> 2040.22]  is
[2040.22 --> 2040.92] ồng
[2040.92 --> 2041.42]  One better
[2041.42 --> 2042.04]  Have a that
[2042.04 --> 2043.00]  One better
[2043.00 --> 2043.48]  two and a half
[2043.48 --> 2044.20]  One better
[2045.08 --> 2045.66]  One better
[2045.66 --> 2046.00]  One better
[2046.00 --> 2046.98]  One better

[2047.66 --> 2048.10]  One better
[2048.10 --> 2049.00]  Two better
[2049.00 --> 2049.30]  One better
[2049.30 --> 2050.16]  Three better

[2050.94 --> 2051.00]  One better
[2051.00 --> 2051.72]  Two better
[2051.72 --> 2053.72]  Amen.
[2081.72 --> 2083.72]  Amen.
[2111.72 --> 2113.72]  Amen.
[2141.72 --> 2143.72]  Amen.
[2171.72 --> 2173.72]  Amen.
[2201.72 --> 2203.72]  Amen.
[2231.72 --> 2233.72]  Amen.
[2261.72 --> 2263.72]  Amen.
[2291.72 --> 2293.72]  Amen.
[2321.72 --> 2323.72]  Amen.
[2351.72 --> 2353.72]  Amen.
[2381.72 --> 2383.72]  Amen.
[2411.72 --> 2413.72]  Amen.
[2441.72 --> 2443.72]  Amen.
[2471.72 --> 2473.72]  Amen.
[2499.72 --> 2501.32]  Let's pray together.
[2501.72 --> 2502.72]  Amen.
[2502.72 --> 2510.12]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you again for feeding us at your table, that we could partake
[2510.12 --> 2516.28]  of your broken body and your shed blood, that we can remember and receive your grace to
[2516.28 --> 2518.72]  us through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2518.72 --> 2523.72]  Lord, we lift up our hearts to you and we give you thanks in Jesus name.
[2523.72 --> 2524.72]  Amen.
[2524.72 --> 2536.24]  So at this time, I want to invite anyone who has brought some food donations for the South
[2536.24 --> 2538.68]  Delta Food Bank to bring them forward.
[2538.68 --> 2546.52]  And of course, we all realize that, you know, giving cash is more efficient and, you know,
[2546.52 --> 2547.52]  better.
[2547.52 --> 2551.72]  But I like to think of this as kind of an embodied experience, right?
[2551.72 --> 2552.72]  Where we can bring our donations forward.
[2552.72 --> 2556.24]  Where we can bring our donations forward and it helps us.
[2556.24 --> 2559.18]  It kind of shapes us into people who can give.
[2559.18 --> 2563.72]  And so let's, maybe if the children or if you brought some things, go ahead and bring them
[2563.72 --> 2564.72]  forward.
[2564.72 --> 2572.72]  And also the children can all come and gather up here with me for the children's message.
[2572.72 --> 2573.72]  Okay.
[2573.72 --> 2586.18]  So come on forward now, bring any donations that you have brought forward.
[2586.18 --> 2590.18]  And all the children can come up and meet me up here.
[2590.18 --> 2590.76]  I hear what them do now.
[2609.18 --> 2613.32]  I will push them to a phys to get readyください.
[2616.26 --> 2618.26]  I will push them.
[2618.26 --> 2648.24]  Thank you.
[2648.26 --> 2650.26]  Okay.
[2651.32 --> 2651.90]  All right.
[2652.26 --> 2653.08]  Come on, kids.
[2654.02 --> 2654.74]  Is everyone here?
[2655.04 --> 2655.86]  You can come sit here.
[2657.16 --> 2657.40]  Uh-oh.
[2657.70 --> 2658.10]  Look at them.
[2674.10 --> 2676.72]  That's it.
[2677.12 --> 2677.86]  Come on.
[2678.26 --> 2686.84]  Okay, kids, I have a question for you.
[2687.92 --> 2692.26]  Who knows what is the holiday that is tomorrow?
[2693.30 --> 2695.00]  Does anybody know what holiday it is?
[2695.38 --> 2696.22]  Shout it out.
[2697.22 --> 2698.06]  What's tomorrow?
[2699.38 --> 2699.88]  Go ahead.
[2700.58 --> 2701.14]  Thanksgiving.
[2701.38 --> 2702.20]  Thanksgiving, right?
[2702.26 --> 2703.32]  Do you all know tomorrow is Thanksgiving?
[2703.32 --> 2703.80]  Thanksgiving?
[2705.84 --> 2706.68]  Maybe not.
[2708.00 --> 2708.74]  You know?
[2709.24 --> 2709.64]  Okay.
[2709.74 --> 2710.82]  So tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
[2711.66 --> 2711.82]  Yeah.
[2712.12 --> 2714.66]  And so what is Thanksgiving about?
[2715.06 --> 2717.24]  What do we say when we are thankful?
[2719.74 --> 2720.40]  Do you know?
[2720.52 --> 2721.00]  What do we say?
[2723.70 --> 2724.90]  Yeah, I heard it.
[2724.90 --> 2725.40]  Right?
[2725.94 --> 2726.58]  Say, say, say.
[2727.08 --> 2727.28]  Right?
[2727.66 --> 2728.46]  What do we say?
[2728.82 --> 2729.42]  Thank you.
[2729.86 --> 2730.00]  Right?
[2730.08 --> 2733.28]  When we're, when we, someone gives us something, we say?
[2734.20 --> 2734.66]  Thank you.
[2734.74 --> 2735.26]  Thank you.
[2735.38 --> 2735.88]  That's right.
[2735.94 --> 2736.30]  Good job.
[2736.36 --> 2736.46]  Yeah.
[2736.50 --> 2736.90]  Thank you.
[2737.90 --> 2741.26]  And if you need help, what do you say?
[2743.00 --> 2743.44]  Please.
[2743.74 --> 2744.22]  Please.
[2744.36 --> 2744.76]  Exactly.
[2744.76 --> 2746.18]  So you say, please.
[2746.96 --> 2752.14]  And then if someone helps you, you can respond and say, thank you.
[2752.36 --> 2753.96]  And then what does that person say?
[2755.56 --> 2756.36]  You're welcome.
[2756.74 --> 2757.18]  Exactly.
[2758.08 --> 2759.60]  So let's all try it.
[2759.72 --> 2759.92]  Ready?
[2760.10 --> 2761.82]  I'll say, please help me.
[2763.74 --> 2764.58]  How's that work?
[2764.80 --> 2765.42]  Please help me.
[2765.50 --> 2767.40]  And then we say, thank you.
[2768.24 --> 2770.72]  And then the other person says, you're welcome.
[2771.02 --> 2771.46]  Yeah.
[2771.66 --> 2773.36]  And so I think of it as a circle.
[2773.36 --> 2774.86]  It's kind of like a circle.
[2775.26 --> 2779.38]  And so I brought something today that makes a circle.
[2779.82 --> 2780.00]  Okay?
[2780.12 --> 2781.02]  Can you guys see this?
[2781.84 --> 2782.96]  You know what this is?
[2784.88 --> 2785.54]  Everyone see?
[2785.68 --> 2785.88]  Okay.
[2787.02 --> 2788.22]  This is like a helicopter.
[2789.56 --> 2791.26]  So this is going to make a circuit.
[2791.48 --> 2792.00]  You know a circuit?
[2792.12 --> 2793.76]  A circuit is electrical circle.
[2794.60 --> 2794.86]  Okay?
[2795.46 --> 2796.58]  So watch.
[2796.70 --> 2799.22]  When I put this on here, watch what happens.
[2802.22 --> 2802.58]  Whoop.
[2803.36 --> 2803.92]  Yeah.
[2804.26 --> 2804.74]  Yeah.
[2804.74 --> 2804.84]  Yeah.
[2805.02 --> 2805.36]  Right?
[2805.88 --> 2810.26]  So this made me think about being thankful.
[2810.40 --> 2810.80]  You know why?
[2812.00 --> 2816.02]  Because think about this battery as being thankful.
[2816.70 --> 2820.14]  And it teaches us that being thankful is powerful.
[2820.14 --> 2826.94]  And when somebody does something for you and you don't say thank you, the circle gets broken.
[2827.58 --> 2828.86]  It doesn't connect the circle.
[2829.66 --> 2831.72]  And there's nothing exciting happens.
[2831.72 --> 2838.58]  But when you say thank you, and you put it on here, it makes the circle.
[2838.58 --> 2841.54]  And everyone's happy.
[2841.54 --> 2842.80]  Everyone feels happy.
[2843.34 --> 2844.22]  And when we're thankful.
[2845.02 --> 2847.72]  And I don't know if it flies.
[2847.86 --> 2849.54]  But okay.
[2849.64 --> 2851.40]  So this battery is like thankfulness.
[2851.56 --> 2852.00]  Okay?
[2852.00 --> 2853.40]  And when you're thankful, it's powerful.
[2853.52 --> 2854.46]  This has energy in it.
[2854.80 --> 2857.00]  And when you say thankful, it makes the circle.
[2857.30 --> 2858.94]  And it makes cool things happen.
[2859.40 --> 2859.56]  Okay?
[2859.62 --> 2860.34]  So that's the lesson.
[2861.18 --> 2862.58]  I hope that made sense.
[2862.76 --> 2863.70]  Makes sense to me.
[2864.04 --> 2864.38]  All right.
[2864.38 --> 2866.86]  I want to read a verse from the Bible.
[2867.98 --> 2870.50]  1 Thessalonians 5.18 says.
[2872.12 --> 2872.96]  Where is it?
[2873.06 --> 2873.24]  Okay.
[2874.26 --> 2880.30]  Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[2881.10 --> 2884.44]  Give thanks in all circumstances.
[2884.58 --> 2885.70]  That means all the time.
[2886.58 --> 2887.84]  We can always give thanks.
[2887.84 --> 2889.88]  And it says this is what God wants us to do.
[2890.26 --> 2891.06]  Can you remember that?
[2891.06 --> 2891.46]  Yeah.
[2893.96 --> 2894.40]  Thank you.
[2894.56 --> 2894.84]  Good.
[2895.14 --> 2895.72]  Let's pray.
[2896.58 --> 2898.50]  Lord, help us to always be thankful.
[2899.08 --> 2902.80]  Help us to complete the circle with the power of gratitude.
[2903.26 --> 2904.64]  We thank you in Jesus' name.
[2904.84 --> 2905.12]  Amen.
[2906.42 --> 2906.78]  Okay.
[2907.38 --> 2916.52]  So children, if you are grade three, no, age three to grade one, you can go to a class.
[2916.70 --> 2920.20]  If you are above grade one, you can go sit back down.
[2922.02 --> 2922.86]  It's up to you.
[2924.68 --> 2926.04]  You have to figure that out.
[2927.00 --> 2928.20]  It's hard for me, too.
[2929.22 --> 2929.40]  Okay.
[2929.44 --> 2930.30]  Go back to your seats.
[2930.88 --> 2938.66]  And all of our Chinese brothers and sisters who want to go with Pastor Nancy, you can go
[2938.66 --> 2941.96]  to have your, continue your worship service.
[2942.62 --> 2943.98]  So you are dismissed now, too.
[2943.98 --> 2944.02]  Thank you.
[2944.02 --> 2944.08]  Thank you.
[2944.08 --> 2944.10]  Thank you.
[2944.10 --> 2944.20]  Thank you.
[2944.20 --> 2944.68]  Thank you.
[2944.68 --> 2946.14]  Thank you.
[2946.14 --> 2946.20]  Thank you.
[2946.20 --> 2948.10]  Thank you.
[2948.10 --> 2948.20]  Thank you.
[2948.20 --> 2948.30]  Thank you.
[2948.30 --> 2948.44]  Thank you.
[2948.44 --> 2949.22]  Thank you.
[2949.22 --> 2950.22]  Thank you.
[2950.22 --> 2951.04]  Thank you.
[2951.06 --> 2981.04]  Thank you.
[2981.06 --> 2990.92]  Today, I'll be reading Luke 17, verses 11 to 19.
[2990.92 --> 2997.86]  Now, on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
[2998.64 --> 3002.96]  As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him.
[3003.46 --> 3006.58]  They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice,
[3007.34 --> 3009.28]  Jesus, Master, have pity on us.
[3009.94 --> 3013.52]  When he saw them, he said, Go show yourselves to the priests.
[3014.12 --> 3016.10]  And as they went, they were cleansed.
[3016.10 --> 3021.50]  One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back praising God in a loud voice.
[3022.30 --> 3026.70]  He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him, and he was a Samaritan.
[3027.66 --> 3031.34]  Jesus asked, Why were not all ten cleansed?
[3031.74 --> 3033.06]  Where are all the other nine?
[3033.66 --> 3036.92]  Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?
[3037.68 --> 3039.96]  Then he said to him, Rise and go.
[3040.18 --> 3041.54]  Your faith has made you well.
[3041.98 --> 3043.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3044.06 --> 3044.98]  Thanks be to God.
[3046.10 --> 3054.12]  So good morning again.
[3056.92 --> 3057.54]  Thank you.
[3057.88 --> 3058.20]  Sorry.
[3060.04 --> 3061.98]  I shouldn't have expected.
[3063.26 --> 3063.70]  Necessarily.
[3063.82 --> 3064.18]  It's okay.
[3064.42 --> 3064.90]  It's my fault.
[3065.98 --> 3066.86]  And happy Thanksgiving.
[3067.28 --> 3068.30]  Don't feel like you have to respond.
[3069.86 --> 3074.00]  Today we're taking a break from our sermon series in the Psalms of Ascent
[3074.00 --> 3077.92]  to consider what the Bible has to teach about gratitude.
[3078.74 --> 3081.30]  Actually, there's only one more sermon left in the series.
[3081.50 --> 3082.46]  We'll do it next week.
[3082.74 --> 3083.98]  But still, we're going to take a break.
[3083.98 --> 3088.00]  And as was read for us in Luke 17, this passage.
[3088.10 --> 3095.04]  And what I want to suggest to us this morning is that this beautiful story that was read,
[3095.58 --> 3098.04]  it's only told in the Gospel of Luke.
[3098.04 --> 3100.66]  And it's a story of gratitude.
[3100.66 --> 3106.88]  It's a story of thanksgiving told through the lens of a leper.
[3106.88 --> 3112.32]  So as we come to look at this story together this morning, let me pray for us.
[3112.68 --> 3113.06]  Let's pray.
[3114.98 --> 3122.48]  Our great God and Heavenly Father, we come before you now and ask that you would illumine us
[3122.48 --> 3124.38]  by your Holy Spirit.
[3125.08 --> 3132.46]  Would you speak your words of power into our hearts that we might become people
[3132.46 --> 3138.78]  whose hearts are full of gratitude and thanksgiving because of what you have done for us?
[3139.40 --> 3140.52]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3140.64 --> 3140.86]  Amen.
[3143.28 --> 3145.78]  So I want to tell you about a story I heard.
[3146.16 --> 3149.34]  It's a story about a pastor who has four children.
[3150.64 --> 3155.06]  And so back in the day, and some of you may have remembered back in the day,
[3155.80 --> 3158.20]  the Sabbath day was a special day, wasn't it?
[3158.94 --> 3160.42]  The Sabbath was a special day.
[3160.42 --> 3163.26]  On Sunday, you wore your Sunday best to church.
[3163.38 --> 3164.98]  I see some of you wore your Sunday best.
[3165.16 --> 3165.52]  That's good.
[3166.72 --> 3173.48]  And on Sunday afternoon, you might have the best meal of any meal you would have during that week.
[3174.90 --> 3177.48]  So in this family, they had a tradition.
[3178.24 --> 3182.64]  Each kid would get a Coca-Cola on Sunday afternoon.
[3183.20 --> 3186.50]  They didn't get a soft drink any other day of the week,
[3186.50 --> 3189.88]  but on Sunday afternoon, they got a Coca-Cola.
[3190.42 --> 3190.80]  Right?
[3190.88 --> 3192.24]  And that was a big deal.
[3192.70 --> 3194.62]  That was really special.
[3194.74 --> 3198.62]  That's something that they would look forward to and anticipate and delight in.
[3199.14 --> 3201.04]  And of course, the kids loved it.
[3202.34 --> 3206.86]  So then the pastor moved with his family to Alabama in the United States,
[3207.04 --> 3208.78]  and he took a pastorate there.
[3209.76 --> 3211.40]  And they're getting settled in the church,
[3211.40 --> 3212.74]  and there's this guy in the church.
[3212.80 --> 3214.30]  His name was Mr. Langford.
[3214.30 --> 3220.14]  And Mr. Langford was the president of the Coca-Cola distribution in the area.
[3220.86 --> 3224.74]  So Mr. Langford drops by the house of the new pastor,
[3225.30 --> 3232.34]  and he has a rack of 24 bottles of Coca-Cola,
[3232.62 --> 3234.92]  one whole rack for each kid.
[3235.76 --> 3236.94]  Are you kidding?
[3237.94 --> 3238.26]  Right?
[3238.26 --> 3243.20]  They were used to getting one Coca-Cola on Sundays once a week,
[3243.26 --> 3246.16]  and now they have a whole rack for each of them.
[3247.54 --> 3250.28]  So a couple weeks later, they're pulling out of church,
[3250.48 --> 3252.72]  you know, at the end of the Sunday worship services,
[3253.84 --> 3258.94]  and the pastor sees the man who gave them the Coca-Colas walk by the car.
[3259.02 --> 3261.98]  And so he rolls down the window, and he turns to the kids,
[3261.98 --> 3267.12]  and he says something, you know, I think most of us have heard before.
[3267.92 --> 3270.20]  Kids, that's Mr. Langford.
[3270.96 --> 3273.52]  Mr. Langford gave you the Coca-Colas.
[3274.14 --> 3276.90]  So what do you say to Mr. Langford?
[3278.66 --> 3282.42]  And he said one of his sons stuck his head out of the window and said,
[3282.86 --> 3285.10]  Sir, we're all out of coats.
[3287.44 --> 3287.88]  Right?
[3287.96 --> 3289.90]  Thank you very much, but we need a refill.
[3291.98 --> 3298.00]  And, um, just like those kids, you know, we're all thankless children.
[3299.42 --> 3301.94]  That's our challenge, I think, isn't it?
[3302.70 --> 3310.86]  I have to confess that I am more often complainful than I am thankful.
[3311.62 --> 3314.54]  If you want to know if that's true for you, just ask your family.
[3315.08 --> 3319.62]  I'm sure mine would confirm my analysis.
[3319.62 --> 3329.76]  And, you know, we have faced many dangers over these last months, over this last, you know, year or so.
[3330.84 --> 3333.74]  We've heard of wars all around the world.
[3335.72 --> 3339.24]  Refugees needing refuge.
[3339.24 --> 3342.68]  There have been out-of-control forest fires.
[3343.24 --> 3345.10]  There's been injustice.
[3345.54 --> 3346.70]  There's been a pandemic.
[3348.16 --> 3353.12]  But there is an even greater danger facing us today.
[3354.12 --> 3355.34]  And do you know what it is?
[3356.34 --> 3359.24]  It is the danger of ingratitude.
[3359.24 --> 3361.44]  Now, I know what you're thinking.
[3361.78 --> 3362.16]  Come on.
[3362.74 --> 3363.04]  Right?
[3363.14 --> 3363.74]  Ingratitude?
[3364.68 --> 3367.84]  That's the bigger danger than all of these other things?
[3368.24 --> 3369.32]  The answer is yes.
[3370.16 --> 3378.74]  It's because we see from this account in Luke 17 that it is ingratitude that sends us away from Jesus.
[3379.74 --> 3380.26]  Right?
[3380.30 --> 3385.66]  And there's nothing more dangerous in the entire world than going away from the Savior.
[3385.66 --> 3390.84]  So, you see, ingratitude is dangerous.
[3391.86 --> 3396.58]  But the good news, friends, for us this morning is that Jesus wants to restore us to gratitude.
[3397.48 --> 3397.60]  Right?
[3397.80 --> 3400.80]  Jesus wants to open our eyes to his mercy.
[3401.36 --> 3404.72]  And so that just like the Samaritan leper in this story,
[3404.72 --> 3412.82]  we end up throwing ourselves at Jesus' feet, praising God and thanking him with hearts that are full of gratitude.
[3414.44 --> 3417.74]  And so, and I think this story in Luke 17 can help us.
[3417.80 --> 3420.04]  And so the question for us this morning is this.
[3420.48 --> 3429.08]  How can we become people who respond to God's mercies and his gifts and blessings to us with gratitude?
[3429.08 --> 3439.34]  How can we receive from God and then go to God in gratitude and not receive all of his many mercies that everyone in the world,
[3439.42 --> 3441.78]  whether they acknowledge him or not, do receive?
[3442.72 --> 3447.68]  But to be a Christian means that you respond in gratitude to God.
[3447.68 --> 3450.34]  So we're going to see a couple things.
[3450.42 --> 3455.74]  There's kind of a path or a journey or a trajectory that leads to Jesus.
[3456.68 --> 3461.72]  And the first thing we see that these lepers do is that they cry out to Jesus for mercy.
[3461.78 --> 3462.60]  And that's our first point.
[3462.96 --> 3465.24]  They cry for mercy.
[3465.78 --> 3469.38]  So let's read again verses 11 to 13.
[3469.38 --> 3478.72]  Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
[3479.12 --> 3482.92]  As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him.
[3483.78 --> 3486.62]  They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice,
[3487.34 --> 3491.02]  Jesus, Master, have pity on us.
[3492.76 --> 3494.92]  Okay, and so Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem.
[3495.70 --> 3498.84]  And he walks through a village.
[3498.84 --> 3499.44]  Right?
[3499.56 --> 3503.20]  He actually cuts through the village for a reason.
[3503.82 --> 3506.10]  And it's because there are ten lepers there.
[3506.62 --> 3510.64]  And there's one leper there in particular that he needs to encounter.
[3511.74 --> 3515.10]  So a leper, of course, is a person with leprosy.
[3515.98 --> 3521.66]  It was a skin disease that would cause numbness in your feet, in your hands.
[3521.70 --> 3522.92]  You wouldn't feel pain, actually.
[3524.14 --> 3528.18]  But what would happen is your extremities would fall off.
[3528.18 --> 3529.28]  Your ears would fall off.
[3529.34 --> 3530.44]  Your nose might fall off.
[3530.48 --> 3533.56]  And it would disfigure you horribly.
[3535.26 --> 3539.56]  And leprosy actually required social distancing 2,000 years ago.
[3540.00 --> 3544.80]  They were required to keep 100 paces away from any other person.
[3545.24 --> 3545.36]  Right?
[3545.36 --> 3547.18]  And we notice here in the passage where it says,
[3547.68 --> 3551.62]  They stood at a distance and called to Jesus.
[3553.00 --> 3554.00]  And so what does this mean?
[3554.36 --> 3558.52]  This means if you can place yourself in Jesus' time,
[3559.72 --> 3562.80]  imagine you are a perfectly healthy person.
[3563.40 --> 3564.76]  You're living with your family.
[3565.22 --> 3567.42]  You're working for a living like everyone else.
[3567.42 --> 3573.08]  And then one day you wake up and there is a spot on your hand.
[3573.96 --> 3574.96]  And that's it.
[3575.74 --> 3579.00]  Your life as you knew it is over.
[3579.84 --> 3581.40]  You might wish it was over.
[3581.96 --> 3587.52]  Because at that moment, you will never have intimacy with your spouse ever again.
[3588.28 --> 3590.72]  You won't sleep in the same bed ever again.
[3591.58 --> 3593.96]  You won't live in the same house ever again.
[3594.60 --> 3596.80]  You'll never hug your children again.
[3597.52 --> 3599.02]  You'll never sit at the dinner table.
[3599.80 --> 3602.94]  You are banished outside the village.
[3603.76 --> 3604.56]  You are now a leper.
[3605.46 --> 3609.80]  You are stripped of any ability to work or contribute economically.
[3611.08 --> 3615.42]  You would have to go live in stark poverty and hunger.
[3616.22 --> 3617.96]  Physically, you would become disabled.
[3617.96 --> 3620.48]  Within the religious community,
[3620.90 --> 3624.58]  it would mean that you would be pronounced ritually and ceremonially unclean.
[3624.98 --> 3625.88]  You were defiled,
[3626.20 --> 3630.12]  which means you were cut off from the worship of God in the temple.
[3631.60 --> 3634.82]  And so you see this skin ailment is actually the least of your problems.
[3635.60 --> 3639.18]  And for people who are suffering like these ten lepers were,
[3639.70 --> 3644.48]  they were rejected in every way a human being could possibly be rejected.
[3644.48 --> 3649.04]  And so when Jesus comes to this village,
[3649.90 --> 3652.24]  the lepers are desperate.
[3652.94 --> 3656.84]  You can maybe imagine them in their kind of leper colony,
[3657.30 --> 3659.92]  talking about, you know, they've heard about this Jesus.
[3660.64 --> 3661.98]  Should we go out?
[3662.16 --> 3664.84]  Should we risk it and go out there and expose ourselves
[3664.84 --> 3666.70]  and ask for his help?
[3666.70 --> 3669.70]  And so they do and they cry out,
[3669.86 --> 3674.22]  Master, Jesus, have pity on us.
[3674.82 --> 3675.02]  Right?
[3675.06 --> 3675.98]  I mean, this is it, right?
[3676.06 --> 3677.04]  This is their chance.
[3677.38 --> 3679.26]  How often is Jesus going to pass by?
[3679.82 --> 3682.10]  So they scream and they cry,
[3682.72 --> 3684.40]  have mercy on us.
[3685.54 --> 3687.66]  And what I want us to see here is that the lepers,
[3688.04 --> 3690.08]  they cry out for mercy.
[3690.08 --> 3694.08]  You know, and imagine the shame of it
[3694.08 --> 3696.38]  because, you know, you are outcast from society
[3696.38 --> 3699.08]  and if anyone ventured too close to you,
[3699.16 --> 3700.44]  it was your responsibility
[3700.44 --> 3705.52]  to self-identify the worst thing about yourself
[3705.52 --> 3707.50]  and scream out,
[3707.88 --> 3709.72]  unclean, unclean.
[3710.92 --> 3712.50]  Stay away from me.
[3712.50 --> 3716.28]  But in their need,
[3717.12 --> 3719.66]  they expose themselves before the crowd.
[3719.76 --> 3720.92]  They let everyone see them.
[3721.68 --> 3724.32]  They cry out for mercy, right?
[3724.44 --> 3725.82]  Exposing their shame,
[3726.76 --> 3728.86]  letting their ugliness be seen
[3728.86 --> 3732.28]  and their condition to be named, right?
[3732.38 --> 3734.58]  It's such an act of vulnerability.
[3735.50 --> 3736.22]  They were desperate.
[3737.72 --> 3740.40]  And yet, this was their first step
[3740.40 --> 3741.44]  on the way to gratitude.
[3742.50 --> 3742.94]  Right?
[3743.04 --> 3745.30]  Because when you experience shame and rejection
[3745.30 --> 3747.06]  and a feeling of worthlessness,
[3747.26 --> 3748.66]  like some, you know, all of us do,
[3749.38 --> 3751.80]  what we often want to do is hide.
[3752.26 --> 3752.46]  Right?
[3752.52 --> 3754.44]  Just like think about Adam and Eve in the garden,
[3754.64 --> 3755.68]  hiding from God,
[3756.16 --> 3757.42]  behind the bush,
[3757.62 --> 3759.44]  covering themselves with fig leaves.
[3759.96 --> 3761.34]  The last thing you want to do
[3761.34 --> 3762.46]  is come out into the open
[3762.46 --> 3763.66]  and be known
[3763.66 --> 3766.64]  for the thing that
[3766.64 --> 3768.26]  is broken about you,
[3768.34 --> 3768.92]  for your shame.
[3770.56 --> 3772.08]  But we will never
[3772.08 --> 3773.74]  be thankful
[3773.74 --> 3776.84]  unless we first admit
[3776.84 --> 3777.68]  our deep need.
[3778.34 --> 3778.76]  Right?
[3778.80 --> 3780.00]  We have to cry out and say,
[3780.12 --> 3781.74]  Jesus, have mercy on me.
[3782.34 --> 3784.40]  And that's a scary thing to do.
[3784.94 --> 3786.42]  To admit our need,
[3786.52 --> 3787.66]  to come out in the open,
[3787.92 --> 3789.28]  but that is the first step
[3789.28 --> 3791.04]  on the destination to Jesus.
[3792.32 --> 3793.96]  Before we can thank him,
[3793.96 --> 3795.96]  we have to cry out for mercy.
[3796.02 --> 3797.42]  And that's what these leopards do.
[3797.42 --> 3800.72]  So the question for us this morning is,
[3801.00 --> 3801.36]  what might,
[3801.58 --> 3802.08]  just simply,
[3802.18 --> 3803.50]  what might that look like for you?
[3804.58 --> 3807.08]  What might it look like for you
[3807.08 --> 3810.70]  to expose your need
[3810.70 --> 3812.04]  to Jesus
[3812.04 --> 3814.86]  and to cry out for his mercy?
[3815.58 --> 3817.38]  Because that is the first step.
[3818.26 --> 3819.94]  The second thing we see
[3819.94 --> 3821.72]  the lepers do in this story
[3821.72 --> 3824.16]  is they believe that Jesus sees
[3824.16 --> 3824.88]  and heals.
[3825.98 --> 3826.18]  Okay?
[3826.18 --> 3827.00]  They believe that Jesus
[3827.00 --> 3827.84]  sees and heals.
[3829.80 --> 3830.38]  That's the second point.
[3830.38 --> 3830.46]  Doug?
[3830.76 --> 3831.28]  Second point.
[3832.06 --> 3832.28]  Good.
[3834.76 --> 3836.18]  And I think that
[3836.18 --> 3838.36]  one of the most beautiful phrases
[3838.36 --> 3840.06]  in the whole story
[3840.06 --> 3841.26]  is in verse 13.
[3842.10 --> 3843.58]  It simply says this,
[3843.58 --> 3846.44]  when Jesus saw them.
[3847.44 --> 3848.36]  No, not that one yet.
[3848.44 --> 3848.74]  Go back.
[3849.42 --> 3849.52]  Okay.
[3849.76 --> 3851.12]  When Jesus saw them.
[3852.36 --> 3855.74]  And so these invisible outcasts
[3855.74 --> 3857.60]  who nobody wants to see,
[3857.92 --> 3859.86]  who are hidden away from society,
[3860.74 --> 3862.38]  Jesus saw them.
[3863.36 --> 3864.40]  No one else sees them.
[3864.44 --> 3865.82]  No one else wants to see them.
[3866.38 --> 3867.56]  But Jesus saw them.
[3868.36 --> 3869.34]  You know, there's another story
[3869.34 --> 3869.90]  in the Bible,
[3870.50 --> 3871.86]  in Genesis chapter 16,
[3871.86 --> 3873.96]  about an outcast
[3873.96 --> 3875.28]  who experiences shame.
[3875.90 --> 3876.72]  Her name was Hagar.
[3877.52 --> 3879.70]  She was a young Egyptian slave
[3879.70 --> 3882.30]  purchased by a wealthy couple
[3882.30 --> 3883.88]  struggling with infertility
[3883.88 --> 3885.80]  whose names were Abraham and Sarah.
[3886.74 --> 3888.30]  And Hagar conceived a child
[3888.30 --> 3889.04]  for the couple.
[3890.08 --> 3891.40]  But in doing so,
[3891.50 --> 3893.02]  she gets on the bad side of Sarah
[3893.02 --> 3894.28]  who mistreats her
[3894.28 --> 3896.24]  and eventually kicks her out
[3896.24 --> 3898.34]  to die in the wilderness.
[3898.34 --> 3901.46]  And there in the desert,
[3901.86 --> 3903.72]  as Hagar is huddled up
[3903.72 --> 3905.96]  under a bush preparing to die,
[3906.80 --> 3908.26]  something miraculous happens.
[3908.74 --> 3911.10]  The holy God of Israel
[3911.10 --> 3913.04]  comes to her.
[3914.36 --> 3916.84]  This Egyptian slave woman
[3916.84 --> 3918.68]  who is outcast from God's people.
[3919.74 --> 3921.16]  God comes to her.
[3922.16 --> 3923.34]  And he says,
[3924.14 --> 3925.18]  Hagar, where are you going?
[3925.18 --> 3927.54]  So he comes to her.
[3927.86 --> 3929.06]  He listens to her.
[3929.64 --> 3930.86]  He blesses her.
[3931.22 --> 3934.26]  He offers his protection to her.
[3935.06 --> 3936.38]  And Hagar is so moved
[3936.38 --> 3937.32]  by this experience
[3937.32 --> 3939.64]  that she names this God
[3939.64 --> 3941.18]  who she barely knows
[3941.18 --> 3944.02]  and she names him El Roy.
[3945.18 --> 3948.02]  You are the God who sees me.
[3949.60 --> 3951.68]  This is the first time
[3951.68 --> 3952.50]  in the whole Bible
[3952.50 --> 3954.62]  that anyone gives a name to God.
[3955.38 --> 3956.08]  El Roy,
[3956.44 --> 3957.52]  the God who sees me.
[3959.34 --> 3961.12]  So in Luke 17,
[3961.50 --> 3963.10]  what we see here
[3963.10 --> 3964.18]  is that God is here.
[3964.90 --> 3965.00]  Right?
[3965.42 --> 3967.22]  El Roy is here
[3967.22 --> 3968.32]  in the flesh
[3968.32 --> 3969.26]  in Jesus.
[3969.56 --> 3970.36]  He is the God
[3970.36 --> 3972.12]  who sees the outcasts.
[3972.86 --> 3973.68]  He is the one,
[3975.92 --> 3977.48]  the ones that the world
[3977.48 --> 3978.80]  never sees,
[3979.14 --> 3980.04]  Jesus sees them.
[3980.26 --> 3980.36]  Right?
[3980.36 --> 3981.50]  El Roy sees them.
[3982.98 --> 3984.50]  And so here's the good news for us.
[3984.62 --> 3985.46]  What we see here
[3985.46 --> 3988.32]  is that God sees you as well.
[3988.94 --> 3989.90]  God sees you.
[3991.10 --> 3991.40]  Right?
[3991.46 --> 3992.98]  He sees all of the things
[3992.98 --> 3995.02]  that we hide from other people.
[3996.02 --> 3996.46]  Right?
[3996.50 --> 3999.02]  He sees our deep need
[3999.02 --> 4000.12]  for mercy.
[4000.50 --> 4001.68]  He sees it all.
[4002.22 --> 4003.56]  And he looks at us
[4003.56 --> 4004.86]  when he sees our need.
[4005.56 --> 4006.96]  He doesn't look at us
[4006.96 --> 4008.64]  with eyes of condemnation
[4008.64 --> 4010.10]  or disapproval,
[4010.10 --> 4011.78]  but he looks at us
[4011.78 --> 4013.12]  with eyes of love
[4013.12 --> 4013.60]  and mercy.
[4016.16 --> 4016.64]  Okay,
[4016.68 --> 4018.66]  but not only does he see us,
[4019.46 --> 4020.52]  he then heals.
[4020.98 --> 4021.16]  Right?
[4021.78 --> 4023.16]  And how does Jesus
[4023.16 --> 4024.92]  heal these lepers?
[4025.60 --> 4026.74]  It's very interesting.
[4027.54 --> 4029.22]  He doesn't go over
[4029.22 --> 4030.60]  and pray over them.
[4031.38 --> 4032.58]  He doesn't
[4032.58 --> 4033.92]  touch them.
[4034.92 --> 4035.88]  He doesn't say,
[4036.02 --> 4036.86]  he doesn't even say,
[4037.02 --> 4037.60]  be healed.
[4038.30 --> 4039.28]  He doesn't do any of that.
[4039.50 --> 4040.50]  All he says is,
[4040.90 --> 4041.86]  go and show yourself
[4041.86 --> 4042.54]  to the priests.
[4042.96 --> 4043.34]  That's it.
[4043.38 --> 4044.04]  It's like done deal.
[4044.52 --> 4045.66]  I don't even have to say anything.
[4046.06 --> 4047.04]  Just go show yourselves
[4047.04 --> 4047.68]  to the priest.
[4048.46 --> 4050.10]  And that would have made sense
[4050.10 --> 4052.96]  to these lepers
[4052.96 --> 4054.48]  because the priests
[4054.48 --> 4055.20]  in that time
[4055.20 --> 4056.84]  served as the public health officials.
[4057.22 --> 4058.10]  They were the center
[4058.10 --> 4059.74]  for disease control.
[4060.76 --> 4060.86]  Right?
[4060.96 --> 4062.16]  Jesus was only telling them
[4062.16 --> 4063.62]  to do what the law of Moses
[4063.62 --> 4064.50]  told them to do,
[4064.56 --> 4066.02]  which was to go to the priests,
[4066.02 --> 4067.56]  to show themselves
[4067.56 --> 4069.52]  and to be inspected
[4069.52 --> 4070.18]  by the priests
[4070.18 --> 4071.16]  so that they can see
[4071.16 --> 4072.42]  that the healing is legitimate
[4072.42 --> 4073.50]  and that they can then
[4073.50 --> 4075.42]  become back
[4075.42 --> 4076.46]  into the worship of God
[4076.46 --> 4077.52]  and back into society.
[4078.32 --> 4078.62]  See,
[4078.70 --> 4080.10]  according to the Levitical law,
[4080.34 --> 4081.88]  if you were unclean,
[4082.10 --> 4082.78]  you would actually
[4082.78 --> 4083.56]  have to go through
[4083.56 --> 4084.70]  all of these rites
[4084.70 --> 4085.58]  of purification
[4085.58 --> 4087.66]  to then be readmitted
[4087.66 --> 4088.60]  into the temple
[4088.60 --> 4089.92]  and into the worship of God,
[4089.98 --> 4090.48]  to get back
[4090.48 --> 4091.40]  into God's presence.
[4092.72 --> 4094.26]  But what does Jesus do here?
[4094.26 --> 4097.34]  He completely disregards
[4097.34 --> 4098.42]  all of that.
[4099.38 --> 4100.40]  He doesn't go tell them
[4100.40 --> 4102.04]  to do all of these rituals,
[4102.22 --> 4102.60]  does he?
[4103.18 --> 4103.82]  Why not?
[4105.54 --> 4106.58]  He doesn't tell them
[4106.58 --> 4107.46]  to do all these things.
[4107.54 --> 4107.80]  Instead,
[4107.92 --> 4108.88]  he just heals them.
[4110.58 --> 4112.54]  He makes them clean and whole.
[4112.94 --> 4113.70]  The text says,
[4113.82 --> 4114.68]  as they went,
[4114.90 --> 4115.92]  they were cleansed.
[4116.62 --> 4117.74]  They were made whole.
[4117.86 --> 4119.14]  They were ritually pure.
[4119.14 --> 4121.92]  And that means, friends,
[4121.98 --> 4123.44]  that Jesus has the power
[4123.44 --> 4123.96]  to do
[4123.96 --> 4125.50]  what the entire
[4125.50 --> 4126.68]  temple
[4126.68 --> 4128.46]  and priestly system
[4128.46 --> 4129.88]  was designed
[4129.88 --> 4130.72]  to do.
[4132.36 --> 4132.88]  Jesus
[4132.88 --> 4133.98]  just did it
[4133.98 --> 4134.50]  with a word.
[4136.44 --> 4136.66]  And so,
[4136.74 --> 4137.46]  what do the lepers do?
[4137.94 --> 4139.08]  When Jesus tells them
[4139.08 --> 4139.96]  to go to the priests,
[4140.84 --> 4141.72]  one leper,
[4142.48 --> 4143.72]  the Samaritan leper,
[4144.36 --> 4145.34]  does something amazing.
[4146.06 --> 4146.48]  So,
[4146.56 --> 4146.90]  look with me
[4146.90 --> 4147.64]  at verse 15.
[4147.64 --> 4150.06]  It says,
[4150.34 --> 4150.80]  one of them,
[4150.98 --> 4152.32]  when he saw he was healed,
[4152.96 --> 4153.80]  came back,
[4154.24 --> 4155.04]  praising God
[4155.04 --> 4155.68]  in a loud voice.
[4155.72 --> 4156.14]  And he's making
[4156.14 --> 4156.92]  a fool of himself.
[4157.28 --> 4158.16]  He made a fool of himself
[4158.16 --> 4159.24]  before asking for mercy.
[4159.52 --> 4161.00]  Now he's praising God
[4161.00 --> 4161.64]  in a loud voice.
[4161.68 --> 4162.74]  He's just crying out,
[4163.32 --> 4164.16]  praising God,
[4164.98 --> 4166.00]  throws himself
[4166.00 --> 4167.02]  at Jesus' feet
[4167.02 --> 4168.72]  and thanked him.
[4170.76 --> 4171.36]  And as soon,
[4171.44 --> 4171.56]  right,
[4171.60 --> 4172.54]  as soon as he looks down
[4172.54 --> 4173.52]  and sees his skin
[4173.52 --> 4174.24]  and he realizes
[4174.24 --> 4175.32]  he's cleansed,
[4175.32 --> 4176.28]  what does he do?
[4176.28 --> 4178.82]  Jesus says,
[4179.22 --> 4180.50]  go and show yourself
[4180.50 --> 4181.40]  to the priests.
[4182.36 --> 4183.24]  What does this leper do?
[4183.46 --> 4184.42]  Nine of them go do that.
[4184.50 --> 4185.22]  What does this one do?
[4185.92 --> 4186.84]  He turns around
[4186.84 --> 4187.60]  and he goes right back
[4187.60 --> 4188.02]  to Jesus.
[4188.86 --> 4189.78]  Why does he do that?
[4190.44 --> 4190.56]  Right?
[4190.62 --> 4191.60]  Is he ignoring
[4191.60 --> 4193.04]  Jesus' command?
[4194.52 --> 4194.82]  No.
[4195.44 --> 4196.30]  He is doing
[4196.30 --> 4197.86]  exactly what Jesus
[4197.86 --> 4198.62]  said to do
[4198.62 --> 4200.22]  because he's discovered
[4200.22 --> 4201.86]  the true priest.
[4203.02 --> 4203.30]  Right?
[4203.30 --> 4204.16]  He realizes
[4204.16 --> 4205.08]  that Jesus
[4205.08 --> 4206.54]  is the priest.
[4207.14 --> 4207.74]  He realizes
[4207.74 --> 4208.28]  that Jesus
[4208.28 --> 4209.76]  is the temple.
[4210.12 --> 4211.44]  That he is the place
[4211.44 --> 4213.28]  where God's healing
[4213.28 --> 4214.22]  is.
[4215.52 --> 4216.10]  Right?
[4216.20 --> 4216.90]  And remember
[4216.90 --> 4218.84]  back in
[4218.84 --> 4220.10]  verse 11,
[4220.52 --> 4221.78]  it told us
[4221.78 --> 4222.24]  that Jesus
[4222.24 --> 4222.72]  was going
[4222.72 --> 4223.40]  to Jerusalem.
[4224.40 --> 4224.60]  Now,
[4224.68 --> 4225.64]  why was Jesus
[4225.64 --> 4226.48]  going to Jerusalem?
[4227.18 --> 4228.18]  He was going
[4228.18 --> 4228.56]  there
[4228.56 --> 4229.40]  to die.
[4230.36 --> 4230.64]  Right?
[4230.64 --> 4231.36]  He was going
[4231.36 --> 4232.58]  to Jerusalem
[4232.58 --> 4234.26]  to celebrate
[4234.26 --> 4234.86]  the Passover
[4234.86 --> 4235.50]  but actually
[4235.50 --> 4235.98]  more so
[4235.98 --> 4237.04]  to be the Passover.
[4237.86 --> 4238.56]  He was going
[4238.56 --> 4239.48]  to die
[4239.48 --> 4240.44]  as a sacrifice
[4240.44 --> 4241.00]  that would
[4241.00 --> 4241.86]  cleanse us
[4241.86 --> 4242.54]  and restore
[4242.54 --> 4243.54]  us to God
[4243.54 --> 4244.86]  so that once again
[4244.86 --> 4245.88]  we could
[4245.88 --> 4247.52]  worship God
[4247.52 --> 4248.52]  in his presence.
[4249.62 --> 4250.58]  And on the cross,
[4250.70 --> 4250.86]  friends,
[4250.92 --> 4251.62]  what Jesus did
[4251.62 --> 4252.62]  is he became
[4252.62 --> 4253.24]  the leper.
[4253.66 --> 4254.30]  He became
[4254.30 --> 4255.30]  a leper for us.
[4255.78 --> 4255.96]  Right?
[4256.06 --> 4256.50]  Think about it.
[4256.50 --> 4257.02]  He became
[4257.02 --> 4257.72]  disfigured.
[4257.72 --> 4259.94]  He became
[4259.94 --> 4261.02]  an outcast.
[4262.06 --> 4262.28]  You know,
[4262.32 --> 4262.78]  we were studying
[4262.78 --> 4263.50]  the book of John
[4263.50 --> 4264.94]  in our midweek
[4264.94 --> 4265.60]  Bible study
[4265.60 --> 4266.02]  and it says
[4266.02 --> 4266.60]  he came to
[4266.60 --> 4267.08]  those who were
[4267.08 --> 4267.52]  his own
[4267.52 --> 4268.02]  but his own
[4268.02 --> 4268.70]  did not receive
[4268.70 --> 4268.96]  him.
[4269.26 --> 4270.36]  He was an outcast.
[4270.66 --> 4271.72]  The book of Hebrews
[4271.72 --> 4273.20]  says that he was
[4273.20 --> 4273.98]  banished.
[4274.44 --> 4275.14]  He was crucified
[4275.14 --> 4276.90]  outside the city gates
[4276.90 --> 4279.36]  and he died
[4279.36 --> 4280.94]  a shameful death.
[4282.42 --> 4283.38]  And so on the cross,
[4283.50 --> 4283.96]  Jesus took
[4283.96 --> 4284.94]  all of our shame,
[4285.08 --> 4285.76]  all of our
[4285.76 --> 4286.62]  unworthiness,
[4286.62 --> 4288.54]  our unclean
[4288.54 --> 4289.76]  status before God
[4289.76 --> 4290.92]  that separates us
[4290.92 --> 4292.28]  from God
[4292.28 --> 4295.06]  and he pronounces
[4295.06 --> 4296.12]  us clean and whole.
[4297.58 --> 4299.00]  Jesus alone
[4299.00 --> 4300.22]  has the power
[4300.22 --> 4300.88]  to do that.
[4301.46 --> 4302.42]  He can make you
[4302.42 --> 4303.28]  clean no matter
[4303.28 --> 4305.76]  how stained,
[4306.24 --> 4307.20]  how shamed,
[4307.48 --> 4308.08]  how broken
[4308.08 --> 4308.82]  you feel,
[4308.94 --> 4309.70]  no matter what
[4309.70 --> 4311.32]  your record is,
[4311.50 --> 4312.64]  one word
[4312.64 --> 4313.40]  from Jesus
[4313.40 --> 4314.70]  and you are
[4314.70 --> 4315.04]  clean.
[4315.04 --> 4316.68]  there are no
[4316.68 --> 4317.30]  other rights
[4317.30 --> 4318.00]  of purification,
[4318.32 --> 4318.90]  there is no
[4318.90 --> 4319.96]  other place
[4319.96 --> 4321.52]  to be healed
[4321.52 --> 4322.30]  but Jesus.
[4322.76 --> 4323.74]  He has the power
[4323.74 --> 4325.02]  to heal us.
[4326.66 --> 4327.14]  So friends,
[4327.26 --> 4327.98]  in him,
[4328.46 --> 4328.98]  in Jesus,
[4329.08 --> 4329.62]  you are loved
[4329.62 --> 4330.10]  by God.
[4331.00 --> 4332.26]  You are restored
[4332.26 --> 4334.06]  to God
[4334.06 --> 4335.68]  and you are given
[4335.68 --> 4337.14]  a highly honored
[4337.14 --> 4338.34]  status in the sight
[4338.34 --> 4338.74]  of God.
[4339.68 --> 4340.34]  And friends,
[4340.38 --> 4340.80]  the invitation
[4340.80 --> 4342.02]  for us then
[4342.02 --> 4343.34]  is to believe
[4343.34 --> 4343.84]  that truth,
[4343.96 --> 4344.56]  to believe
[4344.56 --> 4345.16]  that Jesus
[4345.16 --> 4347.16]  sees us,
[4347.44 --> 4348.36]  that when we cry
[4348.36 --> 4349.38]  out for mercy,
[4349.72 --> 4350.64]  he hears,
[4350.82 --> 4352.08]  he sees us,
[4352.72 --> 4353.64]  even us,
[4354.24 --> 4355.26]  and that he
[4355.26 --> 4356.22]  heals.
[4359.02 --> 4359.80]  And so that's
[4359.80 --> 4360.18]  what we see
[4360.18 --> 4360.86]  the lepers do.
[4361.74 --> 4363.00]  They cry to Jesus
[4363.00 --> 4363.58]  for help.
[4364.08 --> 4364.86]  They believe
[4364.86 --> 4366.16]  that Jesus sees them
[4366.16 --> 4367.28]  and that he can
[4367.28 --> 4367.84]  heal them.
[4367.84 --> 4369.58]  And the last thing
[4369.58 --> 4370.66]  we see is the response
[4370.66 --> 4371.38]  to this healing.
[4373.94 --> 4374.90]  One man
[4374.90 --> 4376.90]  returns to give thanks.
[4378.02 --> 4378.86]  And here's what
[4378.86 --> 4379.62]  Jesus says to him
[4379.62 --> 4380.46]  in verse 17.
[4381.08 --> 4381.98]  We'll put it up here.
[4386.08 --> 4387.00]  He says,
[4388.20 --> 4391.54]  what Jesus says here
[4391.54 --> 4392.64]  I find very haunting.
[4393.68 --> 4395.04]  I find it something
[4395.04 --> 4396.26]  that we need to
[4396.26 --> 4397.64]  listen to
[4397.64 --> 4398.66]  and consider.
[4399.68 --> 4400.52]  Were not all
[4400.52 --> 4401.46]  ten cleansed?
[4403.10 --> 4403.98]  Where are
[4403.98 --> 4404.76]  the other nine?
[4405.94 --> 4406.78]  Has no one
[4406.78 --> 4407.58]  returned to give
[4407.58 --> 4408.30]  praise to God
[4408.30 --> 4409.86]  except this
[4409.86 --> 4410.80]  foreigner?
[4411.24 --> 4411.96]  This one
[4411.96 --> 4412.86]  who is
[4412.86 --> 4413.76]  doubly
[4413.76 --> 4414.70]  ostracized,
[4414.78 --> 4415.68]  not only as a leper
[4415.68 --> 4416.64]  but as a Samaritan.
[4418.98 --> 4420.00]  Do you think
[4420.00 --> 4421.22]  those other
[4421.22 --> 4422.12]  nine lepers
[4422.12 --> 4423.32]  who didn't go back
[4423.32 --> 4424.06]  to say thanks,
[4424.56 --> 4425.06]  do you think
[4425.06 --> 4425.62]  that they were
[4425.62 --> 4426.70]  not thankful?
[4428.14 --> 4429.04]  I bet you
[4429.04 --> 4429.64]  they were thankful,
[4429.76 --> 4429.96]  right?
[4430.44 --> 4430.78]  I mean,
[4430.86 --> 4431.84]  they had leprosy,
[4432.84 --> 4433.78]  Jesus heals them,
[4433.88 --> 4434.58]  and they don't have
[4434.58 --> 4435.12]  leprosy,
[4435.68 --> 4435.90]  right?
[4435.94 --> 4436.52]  Of course
[4436.52 --> 4437.26]  they were thankful.
[4438.54 --> 4439.58]  But it wasn't
[4439.58 --> 4440.52]  a high enough
[4440.52 --> 4441.06]  priority,
[4441.88 --> 4442.10]  right?
[4442.20 --> 4443.22]  They ran back
[4443.22 --> 4444.32]  to their families
[4444.32 --> 4445.38]  and their friends.
[4445.88 --> 4446.36]  I don't know,
[4446.44 --> 4447.14]  in one sense.
[4447.76 --> 4448.82]  We can't blame them,
[4448.86 --> 4449.44]  of course.
[4450.74 --> 4451.84]  But thankfulness
[4451.84 --> 4452.86]  wasn't a priority,
[4452.86 --> 4453.36]  was it?
[4453.36 --> 4455.24]  And most importantly,
[4455.64 --> 4456.46]  the mercy
[4456.46 --> 4457.56]  they received
[4457.56 --> 4459.22]  didn't lead them
[4459.22 --> 4460.36]  back to Jesus.
[4462.16 --> 4462.92]  You know,
[4463.08 --> 4464.22]  when we think
[4464.22 --> 4465.08]  about the Gospels
[4465.08 --> 4466.20]  and all the healing
[4466.20 --> 4467.46]  that Jesus ever did,
[4468.64 --> 4469.56]  all of those
[4469.56 --> 4470.50]  whom Jesus healed,
[4470.62 --> 4471.24]  eventually,
[4471.38 --> 4471.88]  what happened?
[4473.62 --> 4474.14]  Eventually,
[4474.46 --> 4475.30]  they died
[4475.30 --> 4476.20]  in the end.
[4477.28 --> 4477.42]  Right?
[4477.50 --> 4477.84]  And so,
[4477.94 --> 4478.86]  if Jesus came
[4478.86 --> 4479.68]  just to bring
[4479.68 --> 4480.82]  healing from disease,
[4480.82 --> 4481.88]  then he would have
[4481.88 --> 4482.58]  failed entirely
[4482.58 --> 4483.70]  because still
[4483.70 --> 4484.52]  everyone would have died.
[4486.00 --> 4486.92]  On the surface,
[4487.40 --> 4488.20]  this story
[4488.20 --> 4489.04]  looks just like
[4489.04 --> 4490.12]  a story about healing.
[4490.94 --> 4491.92]  But this is actually
[4491.92 --> 4492.86]  a story about
[4492.86 --> 4494.28]  God's massive grace
[4494.28 --> 4494.96]  to us
[4494.96 --> 4495.88]  through Jesus Christ.
[4496.60 --> 4497.44]  This story is actually
[4497.44 --> 4498.10]  about Jesus.
[4498.88 --> 4500.14]  That Jesus came
[4500.14 --> 4501.66]  not just to
[4501.66 --> 4502.72]  heal our diseases,
[4502.92 --> 4503.36]  but he came
[4503.36 --> 4504.08]  to be our Savior.
[4504.88 --> 4506.10]  That he is
[4506.10 --> 4506.96]  the gift.
[4507.88 --> 4508.04]  Right?
[4508.04 --> 4508.94]  And that falling down
[4508.94 --> 4509.80]  at his feet
[4509.80 --> 4510.96]  and praising him
[4510.96 --> 4511.82]  and thanking him,
[4512.10 --> 4514.14]  that is the healing.
[4516.00 --> 4517.08]  Being healed by Jesus
[4517.08 --> 4517.92]  and then going away,
[4518.04 --> 4518.48]  well, okay,
[4518.64 --> 4520.50]  you're relieved
[4520.50 --> 4521.34]  from your disease,
[4521.86 --> 4522.84]  but that's not
[4522.84 --> 4523.54]  the true healing.
[4523.64 --> 4524.60]  The true healing
[4524.60 --> 4525.88]  is when we return
[4525.88 --> 4526.92]  back to Jesus.
[4528.46 --> 4529.28]  And that's why
[4529.28 --> 4530.10]  this story ends
[4530.10 --> 4530.70]  the way it does
[4530.70 --> 4531.56]  in verse 19.
[4532.46 --> 4533.30]  Jesus says this
[4533.30 --> 4534.26]  to the Samaritan leper,
[4534.90 --> 4535.72]  Rise and go,
[4535.86 --> 4536.48]  your faith
[4536.48 --> 4537.44]  has made you well.
[4538.92 --> 4540.52]  That word well
[4540.52 --> 4541.72]  can also be translated
[4541.72 --> 4542.72]  saved.
[4543.62 --> 4544.40]  Your faith
[4544.40 --> 4545.48]  has saved you.
[4545.58 --> 4546.14]  It's the same word
[4546.14 --> 4546.50]  in Greek.
[4547.82 --> 4548.48]  Ten people
[4548.48 --> 4548.98]  were delivered
[4548.98 --> 4549.76]  from leprosy.
[4551.44 --> 4552.32]  One person
[4552.32 --> 4552.76]  was what?
[4554.28 --> 4555.32]  Only one person
[4555.32 --> 4555.94]  was delivered
[4555.94 --> 4556.40]  to faith
[4556.40 --> 4557.20]  in Jesus Christ.
[4558.06 --> 4558.40]  And friends,
[4558.48 --> 4559.44]  what this tells us
[4559.44 --> 4560.72]  is that all true faith
[4560.72 --> 4561.38]  in God
[4561.38 --> 4562.44]  leads us back
[4562.44 --> 4563.02]  to Jesus.
[4563.92 --> 4564.02]  Right?
[4564.10 --> 4564.76]  All true,
[4565.46 --> 4566.60]  every mercy
[4566.60 --> 4567.80]  that we receive
[4567.80 --> 4568.70]  is meant
[4568.70 --> 4569.44]  to lead us
[4569.44 --> 4569.86]  to Jesus.
[4570.00 --> 4570.64]  Every gift
[4570.64 --> 4571.30]  that we receive
[4571.30 --> 4571.78]  in this life
[4571.78 --> 4572.08]  is meant
[4572.08 --> 4572.42]  to lead us
[4572.42 --> 4572.80]  to Jesus.
[4573.20 --> 4574.08]  Every joy
[4574.08 --> 4575.08]  leads us
[4575.08 --> 4575.58]  to Him.
[4575.88 --> 4576.38]  The point
[4576.38 --> 4577.60]  of all of reality
[4577.60 --> 4578.80]  is to be
[4578.80 --> 4579.86]  at the feet
[4579.86 --> 4580.24]  of Jesus.
[4581.52 --> 4582.20]  So here's
[4582.20 --> 4582.60]  the question
[4582.60 --> 4583.08]  for us.
[4584.36 --> 4585.92]  Are you thankful?
[4588.00 --> 4588.24]  Right?
[4588.34 --> 4589.14]  Are you thankful?
[4589.14 --> 4591.86]  And has that
[4591.86 --> 4593.40]  mercy
[4593.40 --> 4593.96]  that you have
[4593.96 --> 4594.34]  received
[4594.34 --> 4594.82]  and gifts
[4594.82 --> 4596.08]  and the thankfulness
[4596.08 --> 4596.66]  that you have
[4596.66 --> 4597.20]  does that
[4597.20 --> 4598.12]  lead you
[4598.12 --> 4599.42]  to Jesus?
[4600.28 --> 4601.12]  Where you fall
[4601.12 --> 4602.14]  down at His feet
[4602.14 --> 4603.46]  because He
[4603.46 --> 4604.30]  is the source
[4604.30 --> 4605.06]  of all things.
[4607.44 --> 4608.64]  So in this passage
[4608.64 --> 4609.42]  we are called
[4609.42 --> 4610.42]  to cry out
[4610.42 --> 4611.10]  to Jesus
[4611.10 --> 4611.82]  and expose
[4611.82 --> 4612.34]  our need
[4612.34 --> 4612.82]  for mercy.
[4613.18 --> 4613.68]  We are called
[4613.68 --> 4614.26]  to believe
[4614.26 --> 4614.76]  that Jesus
[4614.76 --> 4615.40]  sees us
[4615.40 --> 4615.78]  and that He
[4615.78 --> 4616.56]  heals us
[4616.56 --> 4618.30]  and pronounces us
[4618.30 --> 4619.42]  whole in the gospel
[4619.42 --> 4621.26]  and we are called
[4621.26 --> 4621.94]  to respond
[4621.94 --> 4622.46]  in gratitude
[4622.46 --> 4623.82]  to Jesus.
[4624.76 --> 4625.60]  And when we do
[4625.60 --> 4626.16]  those things
[4626.16 --> 4627.10]  by God's grace
[4627.10 --> 4628.08]  we will end up
[4628.08 --> 4628.76]  right where
[4628.76 --> 4629.88]  the Samaritan leper
[4629.88 --> 4631.04]  ends up
[4631.04 --> 4632.26]  which is restored
[4632.26 --> 4633.12]  to God
[4633.12 --> 4634.52]  and at the feet
[4634.52 --> 4634.94]  of Jesus
[4634.94 --> 4635.86]  giving Him thanks.
[4636.88 --> 4638.16]  So I want to end
[4638.16 --> 4639.08]  with another story
[4639.08 --> 4640.04]  about gratitude
[4640.04 --> 4641.98]  and it's about
[4641.98 --> 4643.38]  Fanny Crosby.
[4644.08 --> 4644.48]  I don't know
[4644.48 --> 4644.96]  if you've heard
[4644.96 --> 4645.20]  of her.
[4645.28 --> 4645.96]  Fanny Crosby.
[4645.96 --> 4646.60]  She wrote
[4646.60 --> 4647.86]  8,000 hymns.
[4648.46 --> 4649.08]  It's remarkable.
[4649.76 --> 4650.16]  I was reading
[4650.16 --> 4651.22]  about her story.
[4651.34 --> 4651.62]  You can see
[4651.62 --> 4652.26]  a little biography
[4652.26 --> 4652.62]  of her
[4652.62 --> 4653.14]  on Christianity
[4653.14 --> 4653.66]  today.
[4655.24 --> 4655.86]  She wrote
[4655.86 --> 4656.68]  so many hymns
[4656.68 --> 4657.60]  she started
[4657.60 --> 4658.12]  writing in
[4658.12 --> 4659.36]  various pen names
[4659.36 --> 4660.08]  so that the hymnal
[4660.08 --> 4660.50]  wasn't just
[4660.50 --> 4661.16]  all her name.
[4661.78 --> 4661.88]  Right?
[4664.70 --> 4665.78]  Remarkably enough
[4665.78 --> 4666.90]  she was blind.
[4668.22 --> 4668.94]  She wasn't
[4668.94 --> 4669.70]  born blind.
[4670.36 --> 4671.28]  She was blinded
[4671.28 --> 4672.28]  by a quack doctor.
[4673.50 --> 4674.46]  She was a little girl.
[4674.88 --> 4675.50]  She had an eye
[4675.50 --> 4675.92]  infection
[4675.92 --> 4677.24]  and the real doctor
[4677.24 --> 4677.82]  was away
[4677.82 --> 4678.46]  and so this
[4678.46 --> 4679.48]  quack doctor
[4679.48 --> 4680.06]  this guy who just
[4680.06 --> 4680.96]  claimed to be a doctor
[4680.96 --> 4681.62]  who wasn't
[4681.62 --> 4683.18]  he took this
[4683.18 --> 4684.48]  extremely hot
[4684.48 --> 4685.90]  polstice
[4685.90 --> 4686.12]  right
[4686.12 --> 4686.66]  or cloth
[4686.66 --> 4688.02]  put it on her eye
[4688.02 --> 4689.20]  scalded her eyes
[4689.20 --> 4690.02]  leaving her blind.
[4692.02 --> 4692.84]  When she was
[4692.84 --> 4693.86]  eight years old
[4693.86 --> 4696.10]  and already blind
[4696.10 --> 4697.96]  she wrote this poem.
[4698.24 --> 4698.94]  It's very famous.
[4699.16 --> 4699.66]  This is what
[4699.66 --> 4700.38]  it says.
[4700.98 --> 4701.94]  We'll have it up here.
[4701.94 --> 4704.80]  Oh what a happy
[4704.80 --> 4706.16]  soul I am
[4706.16 --> 4707.78]  although I cannot
[4707.78 --> 4708.18]  see
[4708.18 --> 4709.98]  I am resolved
[4709.98 --> 4710.96]  that in this world
[4710.96 --> 4712.34]  contented I will be.
[4712.90 --> 4714.08]  How many blessings
[4714.08 --> 4714.94]  I enjoy
[4714.94 --> 4715.86]  that other people
[4715.86 --> 4716.40]  don't
[4716.40 --> 4718.28]  to weep and sigh
[4718.28 --> 4719.26]  because I'm blind
[4719.26 --> 4720.46]  I cannot
[4720.46 --> 4721.74]  and I won't.
[4724.44 --> 4725.06]  Right?
[4725.12 --> 4725.88]  If we have
[4725.88 --> 4727.02]  the spirit of God
[4727.02 --> 4727.92]  inside us
[4727.92 --> 4729.20]  if we have
[4729.20 --> 4729.72]  found
[4729.72 --> 4730.88]  everything we need
[4730.88 --> 4731.70]  at the feet of Jesus
[4731.70 --> 4733.08]  we can always
[4733.08 --> 4733.82]  choose to rejoice.
[4734.76 --> 4735.96]  We can always
[4735.96 --> 4737.34]  choose to be thankful.
[4738.26 --> 4738.68]  So friends
[4738.68 --> 4739.72]  this Thanksgiving
[4739.72 --> 4741.50]  let us
[4741.50 --> 4742.56]  determine
[4742.56 --> 4744.50]  to rejoice
[4744.50 --> 4745.18]  in Jesus.
[4745.86 --> 4746.62]  Let's determine
[4746.62 --> 4747.62]  to give him thanks
[4747.62 --> 4748.80]  to turn back to him
[4748.80 --> 4749.72]  and thank him.
[4750.48 --> 4751.20]  Would you please
[4751.20 --> 4751.72]  pray with me?
[4755.48 --> 4755.96]  Father
[4755.96 --> 4757.44]  it's only by your grace
[4757.44 --> 4758.22]  and your mercy
[4758.22 --> 4760.66]  that you
[4760.66 --> 4762.32]  call us back
[4762.32 --> 4763.00]  to yourself.
[4764.20 --> 4764.72]  Father
[4764.72 --> 4765.78]  we don't respond
[4765.78 --> 4766.88]  to you
[4766.88 --> 4767.88]  because of
[4767.88 --> 4769.04]  anything in us
[4769.04 --> 4770.64]  but because
[4770.64 --> 4772.06]  you have called us.
[4772.80 --> 4773.74]  You have blessed us
[4773.74 --> 4774.20]  with the gift
[4774.20 --> 4775.04]  of your Holy Spirit
[4775.04 --> 4776.56]  and with new life.
[4778.52 --> 4778.94]  And so Lord
[4778.94 --> 4779.58]  we do ask
[4779.58 --> 4780.16]  that you would
[4780.16 --> 4780.84]  help us
[4780.84 --> 4782.04]  to always find
[4782.04 --> 4782.50]  ourselves
[4782.50 --> 4783.32]  turning back
[4783.32 --> 4783.90]  to you.
[4783.90 --> 4786.00]  and when our
[4786.00 --> 4786.50]  hearts
[4786.50 --> 4787.80]  turn away
[4787.80 --> 4788.96]  and we seek
[4788.96 --> 4790.30]  not you
[4790.30 --> 4791.02]  but the gifts
[4791.02 --> 4791.66]  of this world
[4791.66 --> 4792.14]  or the gifts
[4792.14 --> 4792.64]  that even you
[4792.64 --> 4793.14]  give us
[4793.14 --> 4793.88]  Lord bring us
[4793.88 --> 4794.22]  back
[4794.22 --> 4795.52]  and make us
[4795.52 --> 4795.88]  thankful.
[4796.64 --> 4797.80]  Not so that
[4797.80 --> 4798.46]  you would love us
[4798.46 --> 4798.68]  more
[4798.68 --> 4799.70]  but so that
[4799.70 --> 4800.26]  we would
[4800.26 --> 4800.94]  experience
[4800.94 --> 4801.58]  your love
[4801.58 --> 4801.90]  more
[4801.90 --> 4803.22]  as your
[4803.22 --> 4804.02]  sons and daughters.
[4804.56 --> 4805.30]  We pray for your
[4805.30 --> 4806.18]  help in Jesus name.
[4806.72 --> 4806.98]  Amen.
[4806.98 --> 4809.20]  So today
[4809.20 --> 4809.68]  for our
[4809.68 --> 4810.96]  song of
[4810.96 --> 4811.60]  response
[4811.60 --> 4812.20]  after the sermon
[4812.20 --> 4813.06]  I want us to sing
[4813.06 --> 4813.86]  Blessed Assurance
[4813.86 --> 4814.50]  written by
[4814.50 --> 4814.76]  who?
[4815.82 --> 4816.36]  Vinnie Crosby.
[4836.98 --> 4849.10]  Blessed Assurance
[4849.10 --> 4853.66]  Jesus is mine
[4853.66 --> 4856.10]  Oh what a foretaste
[4856.10 --> 4859.10]  of glory divine
[4859.10 --> 4862.10]  Air of salvation
[4862.10 --> 4865.54]  to love God
[4865.54 --> 4868.28]  born of his spirit
[4868.28 --> 4871.52]  washed in his blood
[4871.52 --> 4874.36]  This is my story
[4874.36 --> 4877.64]  This is my song
[4877.64 --> 4880.40]  Praising my Savior

[4899.06 --> 4902.10]  perfect delight
[4902.10 --> 4904.52]  visions of rapture
[4905.16 --> 4908.32]  now burst on my sight
[4908.32 --> 4910.80]  Angels descending
[4910.80 --> 4914.14]  bring from above
[4914.14 --> 4916.94]  echoes of mercy
[4916.94 --> 4920.06]  whispers of love

[4953.80 --> 4955.80]  and happy and blessed
[4955.80 --> 4959.80]  watching and waiting
[4959.80 --> 4961.80]  looking above

[4963.54 --> 4965.54]  filled with his goodness
[4965.54 --> 4966.54]  filled with his goodness
[4966.54 --> 4967.54]  filled with his goodness
[4967.54 --> 4969.54]  and lost in his love
[4969.54 --> 4972.54]  This is my story
[4972.54 --> 4975.54]  This is my song
[4975.54 --> 4978.94]  Praising my Savior
