[0.00 → 12.42] you
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.

[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[269.98 → 299.96] Thank you.
[299.96 → 329.94] Thank you.
[329.94 → 359.92] Thank you.
[359.94 → 389.92] Thank you.
[389.94 → 419.92] Thank you.
[419.92 → 449.90] Thank you.
[449.92 → 479.90] Thank you.
[479.90 → 509.88] Thank you.
[509.90 → 539.86] Thank you.
[539.86 → 569.84] Thank you.
[570.62 → 580.86] So just as the Lord has greeted us, I invite you now to turn to those around you, socially distanced and give a wave, give a greeting.
[580.86 → 610.84] So let's sing together for those of you, let's sing together.
[610.84 → 640.82] Thank you.
[640.84 → 670.82] Thank you.
[670.84 → 700.82] Thank you.
[700.84 → 730.82] Thank you.
[730.84 → 760.82] Thank you.
[760.84 → 790.82] Thank you.
[790.84 → 820.82] Thank you.
[820.84 → 850.82] Thank you.
[850.84 → 880.82] Thank you.
[880.84 → 910.82] Thank you.
[910.84 → 940.82] Thank you.
[940.84 → 970.82] Thank you.
[970.84 → 1000.82] Thank you.
[1000.84 → 1030.82] Thank you.
[1030.82 → 1060.80] Thank you.
[1060.82 → 1090.80] Thank you.
[1090.82 → 1120.80] Thank you.
[1120.82 → 1150.80] Thank you.
[1150.82 → 1180.82] So right now, so right now, so right now, so right now, so right now, and we'll have our
[1180.82 → 1192.62] Good morning. It is great to be back. In-person worship, just a wonderful thing to experience
[1192.62 → 1199.98] and also see again. It's been way too long and in-person worship has been so missed.
[1199.98 → 1208.50] On behalf of the Council of Ladder CRC, I certainly also want to extend a warm welcome
[1208.50 → 1216.04] to all of you that are here today and yes, also to those that are worshipping us, with
[1216.04 → 1223.84] us on livestream or YouTube. We give thanks to our Heavenly Father that the protocols now
[1223.84 → 1232.50] allow us to worship in person with a maximum of 50 people. And we pray and hope that as
[1232.50 → 1242.74] soon as 1st of July, these restrictions can and will be lifted completely. We are, however,
[1242.74 → 1250.96] also so very thankful for modern technology that allows us and makes it available for us
[1250.96 → 1258.92] to be able to worship via livestreaming and YouTube. As a church community, we have continued
[1258.92 → 1266.72] to be richly blessed, being able to worship each Sunday by these mediums. And we are blessed
[1266.72 → 1273.88] and we continue to know that we are also a blessing to those within our church community, but also
[1273.88 → 1283.88] to those outside of our community and to others that we have talked to, seen, and or heard from.
[1283.88 → 1293.76] I'm Joe Chalk. I'm the Chair of Council at Ladder CRC. Your Council has continued to be busy, active,
[1293.76 → 1302.64] throughout the last very challenging year plus during these COVID times. As a Council, both
[1302.64 → 1311.44] our Elders and Deacons have continued to faithfully serve diligently and with perseverance. Your Council
[1311.44 → 1318.24] members remained active, and we know that from the number of members that they continually were in
[1318.24 → 1327.36] contact with, have sought out, and certainly reached out to within our church community and outside of it.
[1329.76 → 1337.44] I want to go off script, my script, for just a minute. I think we need to acknowledge and be so thankful also
[1337.44 → 1350.16] for Pastor Jason, for Pastor Nancy, for our Children's Ministry Director, Hannah, who have just continued to persevere
[1351.28 → 1360.08] beyond what we can even comprehend, I think, sometimes. They act almost and deal almost anonymously
[1360.08 → 1369.44] in the past year plus. Having very little personal contact with people. And I can't imagine what that's
[1369.44 → 1374.88] like. I know what it's like as a person, just part of this church community, but I can't imagine what
[1374.88 → 1385.84] it's like for a pastor, a minister, a person who needs to reach out in person to people. And we need to be so thankful, and we are. Thank you. Jason.
[1385.84 → 1392.32] Thank you.
[1392.32 → 1400.00] Thank you. Regularly at this time of year, some of our elders and deacons complete their designated terms of
[1400.00 → 1407.92] service. New office bearers are sought through nomination process that the congregation is involved in
[1407.92 → 1416.32] by way of putting forward names, asking for involvement, and also then affirming persons
[1417.12 → 1426.72] in their giftedness and ability to serve as elders and deacons. This year, we were seeking to fill two
[1426.72 → 1437.36] positions each, both elder and deacon. One of our retiring elders, fortunately, graciously accepted our
[1437.36 → 1443.84] request to stay on for another year. And Harry Canthal will be filling one of the elder positions.
[1445.52 → 1451.76] The other elder position will be filled by John Van der Meet, who was affirmed by acclamation by this
[1451.76 → 1459.84] congregation recently. Five nominees for deacons were put forward by the congregation for affirmation.
[1459.84 → 1467.84] In this morning, we will have the privilege of selecting our two new deacons by way of a lot draw.
[1470.00 → 1477.12] Before we have the lot draw, we would be remiss if we did not thank and honour those office bearers
[1477.92 → 1482.08] who have served on council for the past three years.
[1482.08 → 1492.32] Jane Patterson and Johnny Canthal demonstrated mercy and were so faithful in showing their love in their office
[1492.32 → 1501.84] of deacon. Hans Bonks and Ernst de Vries were so caring and constantly in touch with our congregants,
[1502.72 → 1505.60] sharing their love and their care for all of us.
[1505.60 → 1514.40] We want to also have a special remembrance and a word of thanks to Ernst and his wife, Winnie,
[1515.52 → 1524.16] both of whom have played such an important part in our faith community for the last 35 plus years.
[1525.36 → 1530.08] Both of them serving us and the community in so many ways.
[1530.08 → 1536.64] They have moved to Alberta and will be so missed here at Ladder CRC.
[1538.00 → 1547.52] Thank you so much for all of your service to us here and thank you to Hans and Jane and Johnny for
[1547.52 → 1553.20] your terms of service. A break from that service is well deserved. Thank you.
[1553.20 → 1563.92] Before we commence with the ballot draw for the two deacon positions, I would like to lead you
[1564.64 → 1571.92] in a word of prayer. Please join me in prayer of thanks and God's leading in this selection process.
[1571.92 → 1582.64] Father God, we thank you for your faithfulness shown to us in so many ways and so evident to us all
[1583.36 → 1589.84] again this morning. Thank you for the freedom and opportunity to spend time in worship and praise.
[1591.12 → 1598.72] We can so easily forget that we may and can worship in freedom, and we do so in truth and love
[1598.72 → 1606.88] and with much faithfulness. We also give thanks to faithful office bearers here at Ladder CRC,
[1608.00 → 1615.36] those who serve this church community in your service and in your leading. We give thanks for
[1615.36 → 1621.44] the faithfulness and dedication of our retiring servants, for Jane and Johnny who served so willingly
[1621.44 → 1631.04] as deacons, for Hans and Ernst, who you used to show your love and compassion and care for so many.
[1632.32 → 1640.32] Yes, Lord, these persons were your hands and your feet and your voices in our congregation and to our
[1640.32 → 1647.92] congregation. Thank you for them and for their service. Father, we ask that you also lead in this
[1647.92 → 1656.72] nomination process for the new deacon positions and that through this process we too may be able to
[1656.72 → 1664.56] discern your will for those that will continue to serve in our council. Provide us you're blessing on
[1664.56 → 1672.16] this process and on this remainder on the remainder of this worship service. We offer our praise,
[1672.16 → 1680.80] our thanksgiving, our Thanksgiving. May it be found acceptable in your sight. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1684.24 → 1688.08] If I could ask John and Jane to come up, please.
[1688.08 → 1696.08] John and Jane to come up, please.
[1696.08 → 1696.88] JOHN JOSEPH trips
[1696.88 → 1697.08] MS Graves
[1697.08 → 1706.80] DR. We'll be drawing two names for deacon.
[1707.36 → 1709.44] MR.
[1709.44 → 1722.88] first name is Michaela van Rican. Congratulations, Michaela.
[1722.88 → 1726.34] We knew this would happen.
[1727.20 → 1729.04] The second name pulled is Jason Van Ryan,
[1729.16 → 1731.62] so we'll have to discard this, unfortunately,
[1731.68 → 1732.72] because they're from the same family.
[1732.72 → 1734.10] They cannot serve as deacons.
[1734.84 → 1735.98] So, sorry, Jason.
[1747.96 → 1752.30] Our second deacon, Abbas Stalinabad.
[1752.80 → 1754.88] Thank you to those who put their names forward,
[1755.44 → 1759.66] and we thank Michaela and Abbas for the next three years of service.
[1759.66 → 1762.14] And I want to just personally say thanks to Jane
[1762.14 → 1765.60] for her great past three years working alongside you as a deacon.
[1765.72 → 1766.96] It's been a privilege and an honour.
[1769.26 → 1770.42] Thank you very much.
[1770.42 → 1783.94] Thank you, Joe, for your kind words of encouragement to me,
[1784.02 → 1785.42] and also thank you to all of you
[1785.42 → 1790.46] who have been supporting myself and Pastor Nancy and Hannah
[1790.46 → 1793.60] as we've sought to continue to serve the Lord in this time.
[1793.60 → 1796.82] We'll continue our worship this morning,
[1796.82 → 1799.98] and we come now to a time of confession.
[1801.04 → 1804.84] Having worshipped the Lord, remembered his promises,
[1805.26 → 1806.10] heard his call,
[1806.20 → 1810.90] we now come and acknowledge that we fall short of God's glory,
[1811.46 → 1814.56] but that also, because of the gospel,
[1814.68 → 1816.58] we can look to Jesus, our Saviour.
[1816.58 → 1819.34] So this is a kind of simple confession.
[1819.86 → 1821.04] It's a responsive one.
[1821.14 → 1824.22] So where it says all, again, I'll ask you to say it with me.
[1824.22 → 1829.92] From delusion to truth and into your righteous way,
[1831.04 → 1832.78] lead us, Father God.
[1833.42 → 1838.26] From darkness to light and into your gracious will,
[1839.26 → 1841.12] lead us, Saviour Christ.
[1841.98 → 1847.00] From death to immortality and into your joyful presence,
[1848.06 → 1849.80] lead us, powerful spirit.
[1850.50 → 1853.92] I invite you to take a moment in the quietness of your own hearts.
[1853.92 → 1856.40] Come before the Lord, confess your sin to him.
[1871.94 → 1875.84] Brothers and sisters, hear these words of grace from Titus chapter 3.
[1876.60 → 1881.88] He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done,
[1881.88 → 1883.96] but because of his mercy.
[1884.84 → 1887.40] He saved us through the washing of rebirth
[1887.40 → 1889.78] and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
[1890.48 → 1893.20] whom he poured out on us generously
[1893.20 → 1895.58] through Jesus Christ, our Saviour,
[1896.18 → 1898.66] so that having been justified by his grace,
[1899.20 → 1900.64] we might become heirs,
[1901.42 → 1903.48] having the hope of eternal life.
[1904.04 → 1904.88] Thanks be to God.
[1904.88 → 1907.92] Let's sing a song of response together.
[1907.92 → 1932.52] Lord's my shepherd, I'll not walk.
[1932.52 → 1938.86] He makes me high and pass to his green,
[1939.58 → 1944.74] leads me by the still, still waters.
[1945.74 → 1950.34] His goodness restores my soul,
[1951.00 → 1955.40] and I will trust in you alone.
[1955.40 → 1961.46] I will trust in you alone.
[1961.46 → 1968.88] For your endless mercy follows me.
[1968.88 → 1974.56] Your goodness will lead me home.
[1974.56 → 1979.62] He adds my ways to righteousness,
[1979.62 → 1986.92] and he annoys my head with all.
[1986.92 → 1993.66] When my covering overflows in joy,
[1993.66 → 1999.46] I feast on his pure delights,
[1999.46 → 2004.52] and I will trust in you alone.
[2004.52 → 2010.62] And I will trust in you alone.
[2012.10 → 2018.00] For your endless mercy follows me.
[2018.00 → 2023.60] Your goodness will lead me home.
[2023.60 → 2030.04] Though I walk in darkness now,
[2030.04 → 2036.10] I will not fear the evil one.
[2036.10 → 2039.20] For you are with me,
[2039.20 → 2042.88] and your other than stand
[2042.88 → 2047.98] are the comfort I need to know.
[2047.98 → 2052.98] And I will trust in you alone.
[2052.98 → 2054.98] And I will trust in you alone.
[2054.98 → 2059.98] And I will trust in you alone.
[2059.98 → 2066.98] For your endless mercy follows me.
[2066.98 → 2072.98] Your goodness will lead me home.
[2072.98 → 2074.98] Amen.
[2074.98 → 2091.54] So good morning again.
[2091.54 → 2097.38] So today is the beginning of our summer preaching series.
[2097.38 → 2101.54] And this series focuses on pretty much
[2101.54 → 2104.62] what is my favourite section of the book of Psalms.
[2104.62 → 2108.18] It's known as the Psalms of Ascent.
[2108.18 → 2110.38] It's a collection of 15 Psalms.
[2110.38 → 2114.78] Psalm 120 through Psalm 134.
[2114.78 → 2119.26] And they're often known as the Pilgrim Psalms.
[2119.26 → 2122.46] Now we can't be completely sure of this,
[2122.46 → 2126.58] but most scholars believe that these Psalms were sung
[2126.58 → 2131.06] by people as they would make their way.
[2131.06 → 2133.58] They would take a journey to Jerusalem
[2133.58 → 2134.98] for the great holy days,
[2134.98 → 2138.62] for the great festivals of the Jewish calendar,
[2138.62 → 2141.48] three times a year for the festivals of Passover,
[2141.48 → 2144.22] of tabernacles,
[2144.22 → 2148.24] and one more that's not coming to mind.
[2149.84 → 2151.92] But it was kind of like the spring,
[2152.14 → 2153.42] and the summer, and the fall.
[2154.24 → 2156.14] So maybe if we use our imaginations,
[2156.14 → 2160.58] we can imagine these Hebrew men, women, and children
[2160.58 → 2163.10] packing their bags for a trip.
[2164.48 → 2166.28] And then as they made their way,
[2166.42 → 2167.84] leaving their towns and villages,
[2168.00 → 2168.90] heading to Jerusalem,
[2168.90 → 2172.12] they would sing these 15 songs as they went.
[2172.62 → 2174.54] So that is the origin and the background
[2174.54 → 2176.60] for these songs of ascent.
[2176.70 → 2177.68] They were pilgrim songs.
[2177.68 → 2180.62] But they also are given to us,
[2180.66 → 2182.62] and they seem intended to help us,
[2183.10 → 2186.56] not only on this literal journey to Jerusalem,
[2186.68 → 2188.70] but also for our spiritual journeys,
[2189.30 → 2193.04] our journeys upward and closer to God.
[2193.92 → 2194.88] In other words,
[2195.04 → 2198.12] pilgrimage is also the way to understand
[2198.12 → 2200.00] the entirety of the Christian life.
[2200.70 → 2200.80] Right?
[2200.90 → 2202.40] Life is a pilgrimage.
[2202.40 → 2205.44] And in this pilgrimage of life,
[2205.54 → 2207.56] just like on a literal pilgrimage,
[2208.36 → 2210.64] there will be ups and downs.
[2211.34 → 2213.44] There will be peaks and valleys.
[2213.64 → 2214.68] There will be good times,
[2214.76 → 2216.38] and there will be hard times.
[2217.62 → 2220.16] In Mark chapter 10,
[2220.54 → 2221.58] I want to share a quote,
[2222.62 → 2224.84] a passage of scripture we'll have on the screen.
[2225.86 → 2227.48] Jesus was travelling to Jerusalem
[2227.48 → 2229.82] for the feast of Passover with his disciples.
[2229.82 → 2232.26] He was making just this kind of pilgrimage.
[2232.40 → 2234.14] That the Psalms of Ascent talks about.
[2234.74 → 2235.78] He was with his disciples.
[2237.06 → 2239.80] And Mark, the gospel, records this.
[2241.04 → 2241.64] It says,
[2242.22 → 2244.94] And they were on the road going up to Jerusalem,
[2245.64 → 2247.32] and Jesus was walking ahead of them.
[2247.96 → 2250.06] And they were amazed,
[2250.72 → 2252.38] and those who followed were afraid.
[2254.26 → 2256.02] So I want us to think about that.
[2256.86 → 2258.58] You know, I think we can identify
[2258.58 → 2260.20] with these first disciples.
[2260.20 → 2262.04] In the Christian life,
[2262.12 → 2265.64] sometimes we can be amazed by God's grace.
[2265.96 → 2269.08] We can be amazed by his blessings to us in this life.
[2270.20 → 2273.36] You know, we can be amazed by his work in this world.
[2274.36 → 2275.18] But also,
[2275.54 → 2277.14] there's a lot of uncertainty.
[2278.04 → 2279.28] There's a lot of fear.
[2279.94 → 2281.10] There are dangers.
[2281.92 → 2285.46] There are difficult stretches along the way.
[2285.46 → 2290.42] So we too are often amazed and afraid.
[2291.46 → 2293.64] We also experience both of those emotions.
[2294.30 → 2297.16] And the Songs of Ascent capture all of those emotions,
[2297.58 → 2299.30] and they bring us to a place
[2299.30 → 2301.36] where we can express those emotions to God,
[2301.72 → 2305.98] and that we can then grow in our trust in God.
[2307.26 → 2310.12] And so we're calling this series Songs for the Journey.
[2310.12 → 2315.26] Because not only were these songs sung on the actual journey
[2315.26 → 2316.62] that people would take to Jerusalem,
[2316.76 → 2318.88] but they're also sung by Christians today
[2318.88 → 2321.52] on our own spiritual journeys to God.
[2322.20 → 2324.26] So I'm excited to begin this series,
[2324.64 → 2327.92] and my prayer is that we would be formed and shaped
[2327.92 → 2329.48] to walk with God
[2329.48 → 2332.96] through the results of his word.
[2332.96 → 2336.64] So let's read the first psalm of this collection,
[2337.14 → 2338.10] Psalm 120.
[2339.04 → 2340.48] And we have it here on the screen,
[2340.58 → 2341.70] and I will read it for us.
[2342.76 → 2343.98] A Song of Ascents.
[2344.98 → 2347.72] I call on the Lord in my distress,
[2348.36 → 2349.42] and he answers me.
[2350.70 → 2354.80] Save me, Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.
[2355.46 → 2356.96] What will he do to you,
[2356.98 → 2359.12] and what more besides you deceitful tongue?
[2359.80 → 2362.16] He will punish you with a warrior's sharp arrows,
[2362.16 → 2365.16] and with burning coals of the broom tree.
[2366.38 → 2368.46] Woe to me that I dwell in Meshach,
[2368.52 → 2370.52] that I live among the tents of Kadar.
[2371.30 → 2374.58] Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.
[2375.42 → 2377.24] I am for peace,
[2377.78 → 2379.08] but when I speak,
[2380.04 → 2381.64] they are for war.
[2382.82 → 2384.40] Friends, this is the word of the Lord.
[2385.76 → 2386.84] Let's pray together.
[2386.84 → 2390.54] Father, we come before you,
[2390.68 → 2393.56] and we come as your servants
[2393.56 → 2396.36] to hear what you would speak to us.
[2397.14 → 2399.62] Lord, we thank you for these psalms,
[2399.66 → 2400.92] and we thank you for Psalm 120.
[2402.10 → 2403.56] Lord, would you open our eyes
[2403.56 → 2405.38] to see and to hear
[2405.38 → 2406.96] what you would have to say
[2406.96 → 2409.10] to each one of us this morning.
[2410.10 → 2411.56] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2411.94 → 2412.22] Amen.
[2413.78 → 2414.84] So as we read,
[2414.96 → 2417.88] and if you look at the Bible,
[2418.06 → 2419.32] and if you do have a Bible,
[2419.42 → 2420.30] I do encourage you
[2420.30 → 2421.98] to bring it when you come,
[2422.08 → 2422.92] and I have it in front of you.
[2422.98 → 2424.54] We'll be working our way through the passage.
[2424.72 → 2425.64] Maybe you have it on your phones.
[2427.10 → 2429.46] But the superscription at the very top says,
[2429.88 → 2431.50] a song of a sense.
[2432.30 → 2433.38] So, a song.
[2433.50 → 2434.24] These were songs.
[2434.34 → 2436.28] They were meant to be sung.
[2436.28 → 2439.06] And just think about singing
[2439.06 → 2440.64] and the power of singing.
[2440.74 → 2441.94] One of the hardest things
[2441.94 → 2444.72] for us over these last 18 months
[2444.72 → 2446.00] is that we haven't been able
[2446.00 → 2448.04] to come together and to sing.
[2448.10 → 2449.86] Even today, those of us who are here,
[2450.42 → 2452.08] you know, we've had to kind of hold it back.
[2452.16 → 2453.14] We haven't been able to sing.
[2453.94 → 2455.18] It's been, on the other hand,
[2455.48 → 2456.14] kind of blessing
[2456.14 → 2457.22] to be able to sing at home
[2457.22 → 2460.32] unless you have to deal with your spouse,
[2460.44 → 2461.42] who's not a good singer.
[2462.36 → 2462.86] But, um,
[2465.02 → 2466.18] I'm putting myself.
[2466.28 → 2468.06] I'm not thinking about Christy.
[2470.78 → 2472.66] But think about the power of singing.
[2472.82 → 2475.40] Think about the deep emotions
[2475.40 → 2477.70] that are conveyed through song.
[2478.72 → 2480.02] Singing can also be a lot of fun.
[2480.20 → 2481.70] You know, maybe there are times in our lives
[2481.70 → 2484.64] when we sang out loud,
[2484.78 → 2485.90] maybe around a campfire,
[2486.04 → 2487.26] maybe in a family gathering,
[2487.36 → 2488.28] and it was a lot of fun.
[2489.78 → 2490.50] But you know,
[2490.58 → 2491.82] one of the things people do
[2491.82 → 2494.90] is they sing to make jobs easier.
[2494.90 → 2495.94] Right?
[2496.06 → 2497.46] So you can whistle while you work,
[2497.68 → 2499.56] as the old Disney movie,
[2500.10 → 2501.28] the song says.
[2501.74 → 2503.26] And so travelling to Jerusalem
[2503.26 → 2505.98] would have been a lot of work.
[2506.86 → 2508.68] Why is this collection of psalms
[2508.68 → 2510.74] called Songs of Ascent?
[2511.28 → 2512.88] Well, because going up to Jerusalem
[2512.88 → 2514.04] was quite a hike.
[2514.04 → 2518.24] Jerusalem was the highest city in Palestine.
[2518.46 → 2519.44] And so for most people
[2519.44 → 2520.86] living in the surrounding areas,
[2521.42 → 2523.10] they would have to make a journey
[2523.10 → 2525.40] that would be a gain in elevation
[2525.40 → 2527.14] of about 3,000 feet
[2527.14 → 2529.86] as they made their way up to Jerusalem,
[2529.86 → 2531.86] which was on the top of Mount Zion.
[2531.86 → 2534.46] About two weeks ago,
[2534.50 → 2535.74] my family and I went on
[2535.74 → 2538.08] our first backpacking trip as a family.
[2538.18 → 2538.94] So each year,
[2539.00 → 2539.96] as the kids get older,
[2540.14 → 2542.10] we've been going and taking
[2542.10 → 2543.80] one of them and two of them
[2543.80 → 2544.52] and three of them.
[2544.60 → 2545.80] Then this summer, finally,
[2546.24 → 2547.44] my youngest daughter, Gabby,
[2547.44 → 2548.18] is old enough
[2548.18 → 2549.78] to carry her own pack,
[2549.88 → 2551.02] to carry her own sleeping bag.
[2551.50 → 2552.92] And so now Christy was able to come
[2552.92 → 2554.16] and all of us as a family
[2554.16 → 2555.14] went on our first trip.
[2555.64 → 2556.26] It was great.
[2557.30 → 2558.76] It was a fairly easy hike,
[2558.98 → 2560.82] about seven kilometres to the campground.
[2561.82 → 2563.00] So my daughter Gabby, though,
[2563.02 → 2564.02] she's carrying her pack
[2564.02 → 2567.00] and she begins to feel very tired
[2567.00 → 2569.38] because her pack is so heavy.
[2570.08 → 2572.16] And I told her it was probably
[2572.16 → 2574.54] because of all the rocks
[2574.54 → 2575.78] that she was collecting
[2575.78 → 2577.46] and storing in her pack.
[2577.58 → 2578.58] But she insisted
[2578.58 → 2580.32] that it has nothing to do with it.
[2582.58 → 2583.52] But it was, you know,
[2583.56 → 2585.48] a challenging hike for a little kid.
[2585.54 → 2587.00] And so we encouraged the kids
[2587.00 → 2588.36] in order to pass the time,
[2588.70 → 2590.18] in order to make the journey
[2590.18 → 2591.46] more easy,
[2592.32 → 2593.86] we encouraged them to sing.
[2595.00 → 2596.94] So one of the songs we like to sing
[2596.94 → 2598.02] is this children's song,
[2598.10 → 2599.22] The Ants Go Marching.
[2599.44 → 2600.86] One by one, hurrah, hurrah,
[2600.92 → 2602.12] and you go one to ten.
[2602.82 → 2604.18] And so then my son John
[2604.18 → 2605.06] had the great idea,
[2605.16 → 2605.96] well, he was going to sing
[2605.96 → 2607.32] a hundred bottles of pop on the wall.
[2607.88 → 2609.86] So he made it all the way up
[2609.86 → 2611.00] and then the trip,
[2611.16 → 2612.36] you know, we weren't there yet,
[2612.42 → 2613.44] so he sang up to 200.
[2613.44 → 2616.54] And eventually, Christie told me,
[2616.62 → 2619.00] I was, I decided to distance myself
[2619.00 → 2621.90] from that song.
[2623.00 → 2625.12] But eventually, he sang it on the way back,
[2625.18 → 2626.00] he sang the whole thing,
[2626.44 → 2628.08] and in the car on the way home,
[2628.16 → 2628.94] made it up to a thousand.
[2630.14 → 2631.18] That's perseverance.
[2631.18 → 2637.42] So, singing while you go
[2637.42 → 2639.42] certainly makes the journey
[2639.42 → 2640.20] pass much easier.
[2641.00 → 2642.18] And in the same way,
[2642.84 → 2644.44] these psalms were to be sung
[2644.44 → 2645.06] on a journey.
[2645.90 → 2646.72] And you would imagine
[2646.72 → 2648.44] for the first song,
[2649.02 → 2649.78] what would you imagine?
[2649.86 → 2650.68] Well, you might imagine
[2650.68 → 2652.30] it would be kind of an upbeat
[2652.30 → 2653.26] kind of song.
[2653.80 → 2654.02] Right?
[2654.10 → 2654.98] There would be the sense
[2654.98 → 2655.82] of anticipation,
[2656.04 → 2656.76] of excitement,
[2656.96 → 2658.88] about going on a journey,
[2658.88 → 2662.00] but the surprise of this psalm
[2662.00 → 2663.62] is that this first psalm
[2663.62 → 2665.82] is actually really heavy.
[2667.42 → 2670.32] There's this brokenness
[2670.32 → 2673.28] and dissatisfaction with life
[2673.28 → 2674.28] that we read here.
[2675.82 → 2677.60] Eugene Peterson wrote a commentary
[2677.60 → 2679.10] on the songs of ascent
[2679.10 → 2680.34] called A Long Obedience
[2680.34 → 2681.10] in the Same Direction.
[2681.86 → 2684.22] I am sure I will be quoting
[2684.22 → 2685.16] from this book
[2685.16 → 2687.20] probably every Sunday
[2687.20 → 2688.44] over the next couple of weeks.
[2688.88 → 2690.88] He talks about how
[2690.88 → 2691.94] it's not so much
[2691.94 → 2693.84] the excitement of life
[2693.84 → 2695.78] that causes us to follow God
[2695.78 → 2698.22] on the path of discipleship,
[2698.62 → 2700.98] but rather it's oftentimes
[2700.98 → 2702.48] dissatisfaction.
[2703.70 → 2705.68] Dissatisfaction with the status quo.
[2706.42 → 2707.56] Dissatisfaction with the way
[2707.56 → 2708.30] that things are
[2708.30 → 2709.96] is what brings a movement
[2709.96 → 2711.66] of faith to God.
[2712.34 → 2713.60] So listen to what he says.
[2713.66 → 2714.90] I'll put a quote up here
[2714.90 → 2715.38] on the screen.
[2715.38 → 2718.26] Dissatisfaction with the world
[2718.26 → 2719.62] as it is,
[2720.18 → 2721.78] is preparation for travelling
[2721.78 → 2723.36] the way of Christian discipleship.
[2724.28 → 2725.84] The dissatisfaction coupled
[2725.84 → 2727.84] with a longing for peace
[2727.84 → 2731.08] can set us on a pilgrim path
[2731.08 → 2733.22] of wholeness in God.
[2734.82 → 2736.16] And that is what I think
[2736.16 → 2737.66] is happening here in Psalm 120.
[2738.46 → 2739.38] The psalmist is dissatisfied
[2740.12 → 2741.00] because he's living
[2741.00 → 2741.90] in a broken world,
[2741.90 → 2743.60] and because it's a broken world,
[2743.74 → 2745.20] there are broken people in it.
[2745.72 → 2746.48] And that is kind of
[2746.48 → 2747.82] the central thrust of the psalm,
[2747.86 → 2749.70] that there's this dissatisfaction
[2749.70 → 2752.44] with a broken world,
[2752.56 → 2753.42] and that is something
[2753.42 → 2754.38] that we can all relate to.
[2755.52 → 2757.08] But we also see in this psalm
[2757.08 → 2757.98] that in response
[2757.98 → 2759.10] to this brokenness,
[2759.18 → 2760.90] there is a longing for peace.
[2761.94 → 2762.50] And so that's what
[2762.50 → 2763.50] we're going to look at this morning.
[2763.76 → 2764.94] Just those two points.
[2765.10 → 2765.32] First,
[2765.98 → 2767.88] the distress of a broken world,
[2767.94 → 2768.56] and then secondly,
[2768.90 → 2769.78] the response,
[2769.86 → 2771.10] the longing for peace.
[2771.10 → 2773.04] So let's look at this psalm together.
[2773.62 → 2773.94] First,
[2774.08 → 2775.18] the distress of living
[2775.18 → 2776.14] in a broken world.
[2776.40 → 2776.64] Now,
[2776.74 → 2778.54] we don't know who wrote Psalm 120,
[2779.14 → 2780.40] but we do know
[2780.40 → 2782.62] that he is in deep distress.
[2783.62 → 2784.78] So verse 1 says,
[2785.18 → 2786.32] I call on the Lord
[2786.32 → 2787.40] in my distress,
[2788.40 → 2789.38] and he answers me.
[2790.02 → 2790.96] And then in verse 2,
[2791.12 → 2791.96] we're told the reason
[2791.96 → 2793.06] why he is distressed.
[2793.18 → 2793.58] It says,
[2794.16 → 2795.06] Save me, Lord,
[2795.52 → 2796.82] from lying lips
[2796.82 → 2797.98] and deceitful tongues.
[2798.60 → 2799.48] So he's talking about
[2799.48 → 2800.24] lying lips
[2800.24 → 2802.16] and deceitful tongues.
[2802.86 → 2804.08] That word deceit
[2804.08 → 2806.30] has a sense of shooting.
[2807.26 → 2808.84] So a deceitful tongue
[2808.84 → 2810.12] has this idea
[2810.12 → 2812.02] of shooting words.
[2812.56 → 2812.66] Right?
[2812.74 → 2813.30] They're words
[2813.30 → 2814.04] that are being used
[2814.04 → 2814.86] as ammunition
[2814.86 → 2816.12] against him.
[2817.46 → 2818.50] And this word distress,
[2818.72 → 2819.28] I called out
[2819.28 → 2819.98] to the Lord
[2819.98 → 2821.02] in my distress,
[2821.42 → 2822.68] has this idea
[2822.68 → 2824.08] in the Hebrew
[2824.08 → 2825.58] of being confined
[2825.58 → 2827.54] to a narrow place.
[2828.30 → 2829.20] In other words,
[2829.32 → 2830.60] he's feeling trapped
[2830.60 → 2831.54] by their words.
[2831.86 → 2832.86] He's not able
[2832.86 → 2833.52] to fight
[2833.52 → 2834.46] for himself.
[2834.80 → 2835.64] He's not able
[2835.64 → 2836.18] to flee.
[2837.18 → 2838.14] He felt stuck
[2838.14 → 2838.92] like he wasn't able
[2838.92 → 2839.76] to defend himself.
[2840.84 → 2841.32] Now,
[2841.36 → 2841.82] we don't know
[2841.82 → 2842.54] what's going on.
[2842.60 → 2842.98] We don't know
[2842.98 → 2843.96] the context.
[2844.46 → 2845.58] But what's happening
[2845.58 → 2846.68] is he's being attacked.
[2847.18 → 2848.30] Not physically,
[2849.02 → 2849.74] but verbally.
[2850.42 → 2851.20] With lies
[2851.20 → 2852.06] and with deceit.
[2853.42 → 2854.32] And as we look
[2854.32 → 2854.84] at this psalm,
[2854.88 → 2855.72] I think it talks
[2855.72 → 2856.74] about this attack
[2856.74 → 2857.48] of lies here
[2857.48 → 2858.34] in two ways.
[2859.26 → 2860.42] There are individual
[2860.42 → 2861.78] or personal lies
[2861.78 → 2863.12] and there are
[2863.12 → 2864.24] cultural lies.
[2864.68 → 2865.20] So let's look
[2865.20 → 2865.78] at those two.
[2866.24 → 2866.76] Personally,
[2866.98 → 2867.48] the psalmist
[2867.48 → 2868.34] is experiencing
[2868.34 → 2870.04] gossip and slander
[2870.04 → 2870.88] and there's this
[2870.88 → 2872.88] painful misrepresentation.
[2873.30 → 2874.02] There's an attack
[2874.02 → 2874.96] on his character
[2874.96 → 2876.76] because of these words.
[2877.48 → 2878.12] And it seems
[2878.12 → 2878.56] that they're not
[2878.56 → 2879.34] just words spoken
[2879.34 → 2880.02] casually.
[2880.02 → 2882.60] Maybe a hurtful remark
[2882.60 → 2883.30] that was just
[2883.30 → 2884.26] maybe a mistake.
[2884.62 → 2885.60] But they are more
[2885.60 → 2886.78] sinister than that.
[2886.88 → 2887.88] It's deceit.
[2888.50 → 2890.00] They are carefully
[2890.00 → 2891.60] constructed lies.
[2892.96 → 2893.96] Have you experienced
[2893.96 → 2894.60] that before?
[2896.46 → 2897.74] Are you experiencing
[2897.74 → 2898.68] that even now?
[2898.96 → 2899.14] You know,
[2899.16 → 2899.82] just this type
[2899.82 → 2901.24] of painful verbal attack.
[2901.62 → 2901.82] You know,
[2901.86 → 2902.98] maybe at work
[2902.98 → 2903.70] or at school
[2903.70 → 2904.54] or maybe
[2904.54 → 2905.46] in a family setting.
[2907.90 → 2908.60] Reminded me
[2908.60 → 2909.08] of this old
[2909.08 → 2910.24] childhood rhyme.
[2911.40 → 2912.36] You probably know it.
[2912.78 → 2913.72] Sticks and stones
[2913.72 → 2914.94] may break my bones
[2914.94 → 2916.42] but words
[2916.42 → 2917.26] will never hurt me.
[2918.50 → 2919.42] Is that true?
[2920.46 → 2920.90] No.
[2921.46 → 2922.16] What a lie
[2922.16 → 2923.08] that is, right?
[2924.08 → 2924.36] You know,
[2924.42 → 2925.16] we all know
[2925.16 → 2925.76] that words
[2925.76 → 2927.10] can deeply hurt.
[2927.98 → 2928.52] And we've all
[2928.52 → 2929.26] experienced
[2929.26 → 2930.42] hurtful words.
[2931.36 → 2931.50] You know,
[2931.56 → 2932.52] even the New Testament
[2932.52 → 2933.20] tells us.
[2933.84 → 2934.76] James in his letter
[2934.76 → 2935.78] says all kinds
[2935.78 → 2936.32] of animals,
[2936.52 → 2936.78] birds,
[2936.96 → 2937.42] reptiles,
[2937.42 → 2938.18] and sea creatures
[2938.18 → 2939.34] can be tamed
[2939.34 → 2940.26] and have been tamed
[2940.26 → 2941.30] by mankind
[2941.30 → 2943.06] but no human being
[2943.06 → 2943.98] can tame the tongue.
[2944.78 → 2946.06] It is a restless evil
[2946.06 → 2947.68] full of deadly poison.
[2949.22 → 2950.38] So the psalmist here
[2950.38 → 2951.06] is in distress
[2951.06 → 2952.20] because he has been
[2952.20 → 2952.80] slandered,
[2953.02 → 2954.04] he has been attacked,
[2954.20 → 2955.04] he has been severely
[2955.04 → 2956.60] wounded by the lies
[2956.60 → 2958.02] of others.
[2959.16 → 2960.26] And when that happens
[2960.26 → 2960.80] to us,
[2960.82 → 2962.60] when we hear
[2962.60 → 2963.64] these words,
[2963.70 → 2964.56] if you are called
[2964.56 → 2965.16] something,
[2965.66 → 2966.88] if you are belittled,
[2967.36 → 2967.84] you are called
[2967.84 → 2969.08] bald and ugly, maybe.
[2969.82 → 2970.74] Just a personal example.
[2971.34 → 2972.08] No one calls me that.
[2972.28 → 2974.78] But when that happens,
[2974.86 → 2975.44] what do we do?
[2975.48 → 2976.70] We tend to
[2976.70 → 2977.64] listen
[2977.64 → 2979.50] to those criticisms.
[2980.30 → 2980.96] And they have
[2980.96 → 2981.90] a deep impact
[2981.90 → 2982.42] on us
[2982.42 → 2982.90] and they start
[2982.90 → 2983.64] to shape
[2983.64 → 2984.98] the narrative
[2984.98 → 2986.22] that we believe
[2986.22 → 2987.28] about ourselves.
[2988.28 → 2988.78] Unless
[2988.78 → 2990.18] it is addressed
[2990.18 → 2991.08] by the truth
[2991.08 → 2991.76] of God.
[2992.40 → 2993.28] The truth of God
[2993.28 → 2994.14] that tells us
[2994.14 → 2994.94] that you are
[2994.94 → 2995.80] a child of God,
[2996.00 → 2996.86] that you are
[2996.86 → 2997.66] beloved,
[2997.98 → 2998.46] that you are
[2998.46 → 2998.92] precious
[2998.92 → 3000.24] in my sight.
[3001.72 → 3002.72] So as we
[3002.72 → 3003.84] take this journey
[3003.84 → 3006.50] toward God,
[3006.60 → 3007.22] this journey
[3007.22 → 3007.92] into a deeper,
[3008.06 → 3008.56] more intimate,
[3008.74 → 3009.36] more personal
[3009.36 → 3010.68] relationship with God,
[3011.22 → 3011.90] into a more
[3011.90 → 3013.34] truthful relationship
[3013.34 → 3013.88] with God,
[3013.94 → 3014.94] we've got to get
[3014.94 → 3015.58] that truth
[3015.58 → 3016.58] in our hearts right.
[3017.48 → 3018.42] That who we are
[3018.42 → 3019.26] in God's sight.
[3020.06 → 3021.08] Because only what
[3021.08 → 3022.88] He says about us
[3022.88 → 3024.58] ultimately matters.
[3024.84 → 3025.62] Not the lies
[3025.62 → 3026.22] of others,
[3026.44 → 3027.20] not the lies
[3027.20 → 3027.70] that we even
[3027.70 → 3028.50] tell ourselves.
[3029.24 → 3030.00] What God
[3030.00 → 3031.08] says about us
[3031.08 → 3032.26] is the truth
[3032.26 → 3032.86] that matters.
[3034.82 → 3035.46] But there's,
[3035.60 → 3036.52] that was the personal,
[3036.80 → 3037.86] now there's this also,
[3038.30 → 3039.16] this other kind
[3039.16 → 3040.02] of lie and deceit
[3040.02 → 3040.68] that we see here.
[3040.94 → 3041.76] And I think we see
[3041.76 → 3042.54] this in verse 5.
[3043.40 → 3043.88] He says,
[3043.88 → 3044.74] Woe to me
[3044.74 → 3045.42] that I dwell
[3045.42 → 3046.06] in Meshach
[3046.06 → 3046.70] that I live
[3046.70 → 3047.68] among the tents
[3047.68 → 3048.24] of Kadar.
[3049.62 → 3050.38] So Meshach
[3050.38 → 3051.14] and Kadar
[3051.14 → 3052.40] are places
[3052.40 → 3053.24] far away
[3053.24 → 3053.86] from Israel.
[3054.88 → 3055.68] One along
[3055.68 → 3056.54] the Black Sea,
[3057.04 → 3057.64] the other
[3057.64 → 3058.60] in the Arabian
[3058.60 → 3060.42] tribal areas.
[3060.48 → 3061.10] So it's kind of like
[3061.10 → 3061.66] looking at the map
[3061.66 → 3062.10] of Canada.
[3062.24 → 3063.30] It's as far as
[3063.30 → 3064.00] Quebec
[3064.00 → 3065.10] to Vancouver,
[3065.26 → 3065.94] something like that.
[3067.52 → 3068.22] And so these two
[3068.22 → 3069.18] peoples are used
[3069.18 → 3070.28] here just to refer
[3070.28 → 3071.96] to non-Israelite
[3071.96 → 3072.44] people.
[3073.54 → 3074.56] So they would
[3074.56 → 3075.46] be people
[3075.46 → 3076.38] who don't know
[3076.38 → 3076.70] God.
[3076.70 → 3078.06] they would
[3078.06 → 3078.58] be people
[3078.58 → 3079.30] who don't
[3079.30 → 3080.58] have God's
[3080.58 → 3081.14] word.
[3082.04 → 3082.60] And so
[3082.60 → 3083.16] they're not
[3083.16 → 3084.10] living according
[3084.10 → 3084.98] to God's truth.
[3085.98 → 3086.66] So the entire,
[3086.84 → 3087.40] and so this is
[3087.40 → 3088.18] where God's people
[3088.18 → 3088.94] have been scattered
[3088.94 → 3090.36] and they're living
[3090.36 → 3090.82] in,
[3091.02 → 3091.42] they're living
[3091.42 → 3092.62] outside of Jerusalem
[3092.62 → 3093.76] and so they make
[3093.76 → 3094.48] this journey
[3094.48 → 3095.20] to Jerusalem
[3095.20 → 3096.02] to worship.
[3096.40 → 3097.32] So the psalmist
[3097.32 → 3097.96] here is writing
[3097.96 → 3099.80] from outside
[3099.80 → 3100.58] the diaspora,
[3100.70 → 3101.52] outside
[3101.52 → 3102.54] Israel.
[3103.46 → 3104.36] So he's living
[3104.36 → 3105.06] in this environment
[3105.06 → 3106.72] where people,
[3107.08 → 3107.96] his neighbours,
[3108.12 → 3108.70] people around him
[3108.70 → 3109.38] don't know God.
[3109.50 → 3110.16] They're not Jews,
[3110.28 → 3110.68] they don't have
[3110.68 → 3111.20] God's word.
[3111.56 → 3112.20] And so the entire
[3112.20 → 3113.20] culture that he's
[3113.20 → 3113.94] lived in,
[3114.30 → 3115.00] he's living in
[3115.00 → 3115.74] is shaped
[3115.74 → 3117.16] completely by
[3117.16 → 3117.76] a different
[3117.76 → 3118.64] narrative about
[3118.64 → 3119.16] the world.
[3120.08 → 3120.52] And friends,
[3120.64 → 3120.96] I think,
[3120.96 → 3121.10] you know,
[3121.14 → 3121.60] as we think
[3121.60 → 3122.26] about ourselves,
[3122.38 → 3122.98] that is also
[3122.98 → 3123.74] the environment
[3123.74 → 3124.38] that we live
[3124.38 → 3124.82] in today.
[3125.10 → 3125.94] We live in a
[3125.94 → 3126.66] culture that has
[3126.66 → 3127.46] a very different
[3127.46 → 3128.38] story to tell.
[3130.02 → 3130.62] So Eugene
[3130.62 → 3131.74] Peterson says
[3131.74 → 3132.36] that the
[3132.36 → 3133.30] distress that
[3133.30 → 3133.82] the psalmist
[3133.82 → 3134.46] is facing
[3134.46 → 3135.48] and that
[3135.48 → 3136.16] we also
[3136.16 → 3136.96] experience
[3136.96 → 3137.94] is the
[3137.94 → 3138.70] distress of
[3138.70 → 3139.56] being surrounded
[3139.56 → 3140.78] by stories
[3140.78 → 3141.40] that the
[3141.40 → 3142.88] culture tells
[3142.88 → 3143.24] us about
[3143.24 → 3143.58] ourselves,
[3143.68 → 3144.18] about God,
[3144.24 → 3144.56] about the
[3144.56 → 3144.96] world,
[3145.84 → 3146.24] that have
[3146.24 → 3146.88] no reference
[3146.88 → 3147.54] to truth.
[3147.76 → 3147.92] They have
[3147.92 → 3148.44] no reference
[3148.44 → 3149.10] to God's
[3149.10 → 3149.38] word.
[3150.42 → 3150.96] So I want
[3150.96 → 3151.16] to,
[3151.32 → 3151.82] I think
[3151.82 → 3152.28] what Eugene
[3152.28 → 3152.96] Peterson wrote
[3152.96 → 3153.60] is so brilliant,
[3153.74 → 3154.16] I just want
[3154.16 → 3154.56] to read
[3154.56 → 3155.44] this quote
[3155.44 → 3155.90] to you.
[3155.98 → 3156.32] It's a bit
[3156.32 → 3156.74] longer,
[3157.38 → 3157.68] but we'll
[3157.68 → 3158.04] have this.
[3158.06 → 3158.38] This is what
[3158.38 → 3158.84] he says
[3158.84 → 3159.22] and how we
[3159.22 → 3159.60] can apply
[3159.60 → 3160.18] this verse
[3160.18 → 3161.06] to our own
[3161.06 → 3161.70] lives today.
[3161.70 → 3163.58] calling out
[3163.58 → 3164.00] to God,
[3164.10 → 3164.52] he says,
[3165.12 → 3166.22] rescue me
[3166.22 → 3166.80] from the
[3166.80 → 3168.08] lies of
[3168.08 → 3168.86] advertisers
[3168.86 → 3170.02] who claim
[3170.02 → 3170.36] to know
[3170.36 → 3170.62] what I
[3170.62 → 3170.98] need
[3170.98 → 3172.04] and what
[3172.04 → 3172.58] I desire,
[3173.22 → 3174.38] from the
[3174.38 → 3174.98] lies of
[3174.98 → 3175.80] entertainers
[3175.80 → 3176.36] who promise
[3176.36 → 3176.88] a cheap
[3176.88 → 3177.38] way to
[3177.38 → 3177.70] joy,
[3178.50 → 3179.60] from the
[3179.60 → 3180.04] lies of
[3180.04 → 3180.62] politicians
[3180.62 → 3181.64] who pretend
[3181.64 → 3182.28] to instruct
[3182.28 → 3182.68] me in
[3182.68 → 3183.70] power and
[3183.70 → 3184.18] morality,
[3185.18 → 3186.12] from the
[3186.12 → 3186.52] lies of
[3186.52 → 3187.08] psychologists
[3187.08 → 3187.68] who offer
[3187.68 → 3188.14] to shape
[3188.14 → 3188.82] my behaviour
[3188.82 → 3189.22] and my
[3189.22 → 3189.62] morals,
[3189.62 → 3190.54] so that I
[3190.54 → 3191.10] will live
[3191.10 → 3191.48] long,
[3191.62 → 3191.90] happily,
[3191.98 → 3192.54] and successfully,
[3193.38 → 3194.14] from the
[3194.14 → 3194.70] lies of
[3194.70 → 3195.22] moralists
[3195.22 → 3195.74] who pretend
[3195.74 → 3196.46] to promote
[3196.46 → 3196.94] me to the
[3196.94 → 3197.94] office of
[3197.94 → 3198.66] captain of
[3198.66 → 3199.20] my fate.
[3200.36 → 3200.56] Now,
[3200.58 → 3200.88] here's my
[3200.88 → 3201.18] favourite,
[3202.10 → 3202.48] from the
[3202.48 → 3202.94] lies of
[3202.94 → 3203.36] pastors
[3203.36 → 3205.24] who leave
[3205.24 → 3205.94] the commandment
[3205.94 → 3206.50] of God
[3206.50 → 3207.46] and hold
[3207.46 → 3208.12] fast the
[3208.12 → 3208.98] tradition of
[3208.98 → 3209.24] men.
[3210.26 → 3210.62] There's a
[3210.62 → 3210.96] reminder.
[3213.20 → 3213.76] Rescue me
[3213.76 → 3214.08] from the
[3214.08 → 3214.68] person who
[3214.68 → 3215.34] tells me
[3215.34 → 3216.00] of life
[3216.00 → 3217.38] and omits
[3217.38 → 3217.88] Christ,
[3218.14 → 3219.28] who is
[3219.28 → 3219.90] wise in
[3219.90 → 3220.26] the ways
[3220.26 → 3220.54] of the
[3220.54 → 3221.08] world and
[3221.08 → 3221.88] ignores the
[3221.88 → 3222.48] movement of
[3222.48 → 3222.92] the spirit.
[3225.08 → 3225.76] So those
[3225.76 → 3225.98] are the
[3225.98 → 3226.60] kinds of
[3226.60 → 3227.56] cultural
[3227.56 → 3228.04] lies that
[3228.04 → 3228.48] we hear
[3228.48 → 3228.84] all the
[3228.84 → 3229.16] time,
[3229.22 → 3229.36] right?
[3229.42 → 3229.80] This is
[3229.80 → 3230.26] the air
[3230.26 → 3230.98] we breathe.
[3231.40 → 3231.64] We're
[3231.64 → 3232.02] used to
[3232.02 → 3232.24] it.
[3234.08 → 3234.72] So what
[3234.72 → 3234.98] can we
[3234.98 → 3235.26] do?
[3236.08 → 3236.48] How can
[3236.48 → 3236.78] we know
[3236.78 → 3237.24] the truth
[3237.24 → 3237.60] and live
[3237.60 → 3238.16] according to
[3238.16 → 3238.54] the truth,
[3238.66 → 3239.14] live not
[3239.14 → 3239.84] by lies?
[3240.10 → 3240.40] The
[3240.40 → 3240.80] answer,
[3240.94 → 3241.48] the key,
[3241.76 → 3242.60] is this
[3242.60 → 3243.02] word that
[3243.02 → 3243.48] we find
[3243.48 → 3244.06] twice in
[3244.06 → 3244.56] the psalm,
[3245.04 → 3245.48] and it's
[3245.48 → 3245.98] just simply
[3245.98 → 3246.38] the word
[3246.38 → 3246.82] Lord.
[3246.82 → 3246.86] Lord.
[3247.50 → 3247.88] The word
[3247.88 → 3248.26] Lord.
[3249.26 → 3249.70] I call
[3249.70 → 3250.74] on the
[3250.74 → 3251.44] Lord in
[3251.44 → 3252.00] my distress,
[3252.24 → 3252.54] and he
[3252.54 → 3253.08] answers me,
[3253.36 → 3254.00] save me,
[3254.20 → 3254.80] O Lord.
[3255.96 → 3256.20] Right?
[3256.24 → 3256.82] Because once
[3256.82 → 3257.76] we lift
[3257.76 → 3258.22] our hearts
[3258.22 → 3258.50] and our
[3258.50 → 3259.10] minds to
[3259.10 → 3259.74] God,
[3260.86 → 3261.86] the reality
[3261.86 → 3262.78] of God
[3262.78 → 3263.22] and who
[3263.22 → 3264.08] he is
[3264.08 → 3265.34] fills our
[3265.34 → 3265.94] horizon.
[3267.04 → 3267.18] Right?
[3267.32 → 3268.00] Who he
[3268.00 → 3268.74] has revealed
[3268.74 → 3269.34] himself to
[3269.34 → 3269.56] be in
[3269.56 → 3270.18] his creation
[3270.18 → 3271.12] and redemption,
[3271.68 → 3273.12] we can see
[3273.12 → 3273.48] that,
[3273.56 → 3273.82] and that
[3273.82 → 3274.64] exposes it,
[3274.70 → 3275.48] shines a
[3275.48 → 3275.86] light on
[3275.86 → 3276.22] everything,
[3276.36 → 3276.88] exposes
[3276.88 → 3277.96] the lies.
[3278.86 → 3279.28] So I want
[3279.28 → 3279.76] to continue
[3279.76 → 3280.58] this quote
[3280.58 → 3281.12] by Peterson.
[3281.22 → 3281.46] This is
[3281.46 → 3281.68] what he
[3281.68 → 3282.02] says.
[3282.92 → 3283.46] Here's the
[3283.46 → 3283.80] truth.
[3284.22 → 3284.60] The truth
[3284.60 → 3285.14] about me
[3285.14 → 3285.54] is God
[3285.54 → 3286.06] made me
[3286.06 → 3286.44] and loves
[3286.44 → 3286.68] me.
[3287.50 → 3288.16] The truth
[3288.16 → 3288.64] about those
[3288.64 → 3289.38] sitting beside
[3289.38 → 3290.28] me is that
[3290.28 → 3290.72] God made
[3290.72 → 3291.10] them and
[3291.10 → 3291.70] loves them,
[3292.42 → 3292.84] and each
[3292.84 → 3293.26] one is
[3293.26 → 3293.80] therefore my
[3293.80 → 3294.08] neighbour.
[3295.60 → 3296.32] The truth
[3296.32 → 3296.74] about the
[3296.74 → 3297.16] world is
[3297.16 → 3297.64] that God
[3297.64 → 3298.90] rules and
[3298.90 → 3299.58] provides for
[3299.58 → 3299.84] it.
[3300.58 → 3301.26] The truth
[3301.26 → 3301.66] about what
[3301.66 → 3302.08] is wrong
[3302.08 → 3302.46] with the
[3302.46 → 3302.88] world is
[3302.88 → 3303.44] that I
[3303.44 → 3303.80] and the
[3303.80 → 3304.06] neighbour
[3304.06 → 3304.76] sitting beside
[3304.76 → 3305.86] me have
[3305.86 → 3306.52] sinned in
[3306.52 → 3307.26] refusing to
[3307.26 → 3307.72] let God
[3307.72 → 3308.52] before us,
[3308.94 → 3309.76] over us,
[3310.24 → 3310.70] and in
[3310.70 → 3311.02] us.
[3312.10 → 3312.94] The truth
[3312.94 → 3313.42] about what
[3313.42 → 3313.82] is at the
[3313.82 → 3314.48] centre of
[3314.48 → 3315.10] our lives
[3315.10 → 3315.44] and of
[3315.44 → 3316.00] our history
[3316.00 → 3316.92] is that
[3316.92 → 3317.62] Jesus Christ
[3317.62 → 3318.30] was crucified
[3318.30 → 3318.68] on the
[3318.68 → 3319.26] cross for
[3319.26 → 3319.96] our sins
[3319.96 → 3321.10] and raised
[3321.10 → 3321.52] from the
[3321.52 → 3321.98] tomb for
[3321.98 → 3322.80] our salvation
[3322.80 → 3323.52] and that
[3323.52 → 3323.84] we can
[3323.84 → 3324.40] participate
[3324.40 → 3324.94] in new
[3324.94 → 3326.02] life as
[3326.02 → 3326.50] we believe
[3326.50 → 3326.88] in him,
[3327.48 → 3327.88] accept
[3327.88 → 3328.48] his mercy,
[3329.12 → 3329.78] respond to
[3329.78 → 3330.42] his love,
[3331.16 → 3331.92] attend to
[3331.92 → 3332.56] his commands.
[3332.56 → 3335.04] Isn't
[3335.04 → 3335.58] that great?
[3336.42 → 3336.94] As I
[3336.94 → 3337.30] read that,
[3337.38 → 3338.36] this is
[3338.36 → 3338.64] simple,
[3338.84 → 3339.10] but this
[3339.10 → 3339.72] is the
[3339.72 → 3340.24] reminder
[3340.24 → 3341.44] that we
[3341.44 → 3341.76] need.
[3342.54 → 3343.14] This is
[3343.14 → 3343.54] the truth,
[3343.60 → 3343.86] this is
[3343.86 → 3344.34] the story
[3344.34 → 3344.60] of the
[3344.60 → 3344.88] world,
[3345.08 → 3345.60] of whom
[3345.60 → 3345.94] we are,
[3346.00 → 3346.40] who God
[3346.40 → 3346.86] is,
[3347.38 → 3347.90] that we
[3347.90 → 3348.18] need to
[3348.18 → 3348.46] remind
[3348.46 → 3348.78] ourselves
[3348.78 → 3349.14] of.
[3350.50 → 3351.12] And so
[3351.12 → 3351.56] I think
[3351.56 → 3351.88] it makes
[3351.88 → 3352.60] sense for
[3352.60 → 3353.22] Psalm 120
[3353.22 → 3353.84] to start
[3353.84 → 3354.22] where it
[3354.22 → 3354.54] does,
[3355.72 → 3356.42] the first
[3356.42 → 3356.84] of these
[3356.84 → 3357.54] songs of
[3357.54 → 3358.04] ascent,
[3358.44 → 3359.10] because it's
[3359.10 → 3359.54] sort of like
[3359.54 → 3360.04] a fork in
[3360.04 → 3360.40] the road.
[3361.28 → 3361.48] There's
[3361.48 → 3362.02] two paths
[3362.02 → 3362.30] we can
[3362.30 → 3362.56] take.
[3362.62 → 3362.70] It's
[3362.70 → 3362.94] like a
[3362.94 → 3363.64] crossroads.
[3365.16 → 3365.40] This
[3365.40 → 3365.90] journey of
[3365.90 → 3366.80] faith begins
[3366.80 → 3367.78] with a
[3367.78 → 3368.16] decision.
[3369.20 → 3369.50] It's the
[3369.50 → 3370.06] decision to
[3370.06 → 3370.58] take one
[3370.58 → 3371.16] way instead
[3371.16 → 3371.42] of the
[3371.42 → 3371.64] other.
[3372.20 → 3372.46] It's a
[3372.46 → 3373.04] decision to
[3373.04 → 3374.08] start our
[3374.08 → 3375.46] journey of
[3375.46 → 3376.32] faith seeking
[3376.32 → 3377.16] towards what
[3377.16 → 3378.42] is true and
[3378.42 → 3379.04] good in
[3379.04 → 3379.34] God.
[3380.76 → 3381.54] So that
[3381.54 → 3382.04] is the
[3382.04 → 3383.08] distress of
[3383.08 → 3384.06] living in
[3384.06 → 3384.62] a broken
[3384.62 → 3385.06] world.
[3386.52 → 3387.36] So what we
[3387.36 → 3388.06] see next is
[3388.06 → 3388.88] the response
[3388.88 → 3389.42] to this
[3389.42 → 3389.94] distress,
[3389.94 → 3390.52] which is
[3390.52 → 3390.96] a longing
[3390.96 → 3391.76] for peace.
[3392.10 → 3392.48] That's our
[3392.48 → 3393.12] second point.
[3394.98 → 3395.22] And that
[3395.22 → 3396.00] longing for
[3396.00 → 3397.12] peace begins
[3397.12 → 3398.14] with prayer.
[3398.86 → 3399.22] It begins
[3399.22 → 3399.66] with prayer.
[3400.26 → 3400.56] Again,
[3400.68 → 3401.48] verse 1 says,
[3401.96 → 3403.44] I call on
[3403.44 → 3403.90] the Lord in
[3403.90 → 3404.36] my distress,
[3404.74 → 3405.04] and he
[3405.04 → 3405.66] answers me.
[3406.46 → 3407.34] I call on
[3407.34 → 3407.76] the Lord.
[3408.64 → 3409.12] And so when
[3409.12 → 3409.80] we are feeling
[3409.80 → 3411.52] distressed by
[3411.52 → 3412.42] the lies and
[3412.42 → 3413.32] deceit that are
[3413.32 → 3414.50] maybe against
[3414.50 → 3415.12] us personally,
[3415.38 → 3416.12] by the lies and
[3416.12 → 3416.64] deceit of this
[3416.64 → 3417.30] world where we
[3417.30 → 3417.90] don't know what
[3417.90 → 3418.84] is right,
[3418.94 → 3419.40] we don't know
[3419.40 → 3419.72] what to
[3419.72 → 3420.28] believe,
[3420.78 → 3421.60] we're seeking
[3421.60 → 3422.20] for God's
[3422.20 → 3423.10] word to
[3423.10 → 3423.56] speak into
[3423.56 → 3424.28] our situation,
[3424.80 → 3425.46] what can we
[3425.46 → 3425.70] do?
[3425.88 → 3426.62] We call our
[3426.62 → 3426.94] to the
[3426.94 → 3427.20] Lord.
[3428.02 → 3428.80] James says,
[3429.60 → 3430.18] we can ask
[3430.18 → 3430.76] for wisdom
[3430.76 → 3431.52] and God
[3431.52 → 3432.44] will answer
[3432.44 → 3432.98] that prayer.
[3433.74 → 3434.18] And this is
[3434.18 → 3434.52] the right
[3434.52 → 3435.00] approach,
[3435.36 → 3436.02] going first
[3436.02 → 3436.44] to God
[3436.44 → 3437.10] in prayer.
[3437.94 → 3438.72] In our
[3438.72 → 3439.12] prayers,
[3439.24 → 3439.92] we're invited
[3439.92 → 3440.48] to take
[3440.48 → 3441.58] our distress,
[3441.82 → 3442.26] our hearts
[3442.26 → 3442.78] cry,
[3443.40 → 3444.20] to God,
[3444.30 → 3444.92] to give to
[3444.92 → 3445.22] God,
[3445.26 → 3445.82] and to bring
[3445.82 → 3446.52] to God
[3446.52 → 3447.00] all of our
[3447.00 → 3447.44] distress.
[3448.48 → 3448.98] I call
[3448.98 → 3449.32] on the
[3449.32 → 3449.68] Lord in
[3449.68 → 3450.14] my distress
[3450.14 → 3451.70] and he
[3451.70 → 3452.44] answers me.
[3453.28 → 3453.88] How does
[3453.88 → 3454.48] God answer
[3454.48 → 3454.74] him?
[3455.56 → 3455.84] Well,
[3455.92 → 3456.90] he delivers
[3456.90 → 3457.40] him from
[3457.40 → 3458.28] the anxiety
[3458.28 → 3459.12] of being
[3459.12 → 3459.80] trapped by
[3459.80 → 3460.50] his enemy's
[3460.50 → 3460.84] words.
[3461.44 → 3462.04] He doesn't
[3462.04 → 3463.22] feel like he
[3463.22 → 3463.92] can't escape,
[3464.18 → 3464.68] he can't defend
[3464.68 → 3465.20] himself because
[3465.20 → 3465.82] he has God
[3465.82 → 3466.36] to defend
[3466.36 → 3466.62] him.
[3467.40 → 3468.08] He doesn't
[3468.08 → 3469.02] need to
[3469.02 → 3469.56] escape,
[3470.04 → 3470.62] he just needs
[3470.62 → 3470.96] to believe
[3470.96 → 3471.50] the truth.
[3472.10 → 3472.50] So he's
[3472.50 → 3473.50] delivered from
[3473.50 → 3474.06] the lies
[3474.06 → 3474.60] because he
[3474.60 → 3475.00] knows the
[3475.00 → 3475.34] truth.
[3475.96 → 3476.62] But there's
[3476.62 → 3477.00] a second
[3477.00 → 3477.62] deliverance
[3477.62 → 3477.94] that we
[3477.94 → 3478.18] see.
[3478.28 → 3478.68] He's also
[3478.68 → 3479.42] delivered from
[3479.42 → 3479.88] the need
[3479.88 → 3480.48] to take
[3480.48 → 3481.08] vengeance
[3481.08 → 3481.92] against his
[3481.92 → 3482.34] enemies.
[3482.88 → 3483.40] And I
[3483.40 → 3483.68] think we
[3483.68 → 3484.06] see this
[3484.06 → 3484.38] in verses
[3484.38 → 3484.86] 3 and
[3484.86 → 3485.12] 4.
[3485.74 → 3486.32] I'll read
[3486.32 → 3486.60] it for
[3486.60 → 3486.74] us.
[3486.78 → 3487.20] He says,
[3487.20 → 3488.04] What will
[3488.04 → 3488.44] he does
[3488.44 → 3488.94] to you
[3488.94 → 3489.38] and what
[3489.38 → 3489.64] more
[3489.64 → 3490.18] besides
[3490.18 → 3490.38] you
[3490.38 → 3490.92] deceitful
[3490.92 → 3491.30] tongue?
[3491.92 → 3492.14] He will
[3492.14 → 3492.50] punish
[3492.50 → 3492.90] you with
[3492.90 → 3493.62] a warrior's
[3493.62 → 3494.06] sharp
[3494.06 → 3494.52] arrows,
[3495.16 → 3495.78] with burning
[3495.78 → 3496.48] coals
[3496.48 → 3497.52] of the
[3497.52 → 3498.00] broom bush.
[3499.02 → 3499.28] Now,
[3499.42 → 3500.22] the broom
[3500.22 → 3500.78] tree,
[3501.30 → 3502.20] or bush,
[3502.46 → 3503.08] is known
[3503.08 → 3503.78] for having
[3503.78 → 3504.96] wood that
[3504.96 → 3506.06] burns very
[3506.06 → 3507.18] hot and
[3507.18 → 3508.00] stays hot
[3508.00 → 3508.62] for a long
[3508.62 → 3509.04] time.
[3509.16 → 3509.60] It's perfect
[3509.60 → 3510.10] for making
[3510.10 → 3510.62] coals.
[3511.64 → 3512.38] Sounds a bit
[3512.38 → 3512.68] harsh,
[3512.76 → 3513.18] doesn't it?
[3514.58 → 3515.36] But I think
[3515.36 → 3515.86] we need to
[3515.86 → 3516.36] know something
[3516.36 → 3517.02] about this,
[3517.12 → 3517.86] that there's
[3517.86 → 3518.52] a very important
[3518.52 → 3519.58] lesson for
[3519.58 → 3520.60] us here.
[3521.16 → 3521.46] You see,
[3521.54 → 3521.94] the psalmist
[3521.94 → 3522.44] is actually
[3522.44 → 3523.12] not writing
[3523.12 → 3523.74] about how
[3523.74 → 3524.46] he is going
[3524.46 → 3524.88] to take
[3524.88 → 3525.62] revenge on
[3525.62 → 3526.14] his enemies.
[3526.70 → 3526.84] Right?
[3526.88 → 3527.24] That's not
[3527.24 → 3527.54] what he's
[3527.54 → 3527.80] saying.
[3527.88 → 3528.30] He's not
[3528.30 → 3528.80] crying out
[3528.80 → 3529.14] to God,
[3529.26 → 3529.60] Give me
[3529.60 → 3530.32] strength so
[3530.32 → 3531.02] I can get
[3531.02 → 3532.36] even with
[3532.36 → 3532.72] those who
[3532.72 → 3533.04] have hurt
[3533.04 → 3533.24] me.
[3534.04 → 3534.48] No,
[3534.54 → 3534.84] he's not
[3534.84 → 3535.72] taking revenge,
[3535.92 → 3536.74] he's calling
[3536.74 → 3537.80] on the God
[3537.80 → 3538.56] of justice
[3538.56 → 3539.28] to do
[3539.28 → 3539.80] what is
[3539.80 → 3541.32] right and
[3541.32 → 3542.22] to fix
[3542.22 → 3543.22] the situation.
[3544.02 → 3544.26] Right?
[3544.30 → 3544.60] He's not
[3544.60 → 3545.08] calling out
[3545.08 → 3545.80] for revenge,
[3545.98 → 3546.52] he's calling
[3546.52 → 3546.82] out for
[3546.82 → 3547.28] repentance.
[3548.10 → 3548.60] He's praying
[3548.60 → 3549.10] that God
[3549.10 → 3549.70] would cause
[3549.70 → 3550.10] his enemies
[3550.10 → 3550.66] to repent.
[3552.00 → 3552.42] And if
[3552.42 → 3553.08] not,
[3553.64 → 3554.46] that God
[3554.46 → 3555.10] would bring
[3555.10 → 3555.66] his
[3555.66 → 3556.54] restorative
[3556.54 → 3557.08] justice.
[3558.16 → 3558.36] You know,
[3558.40 → 3559.04] because the
[3559.04 → 3560.24] real danger
[3560.24 → 3562.04] of someone
[3562.04 → 3562.86] hurting you
[3562.86 → 3564.54] is that
[3564.54 → 3564.92] you will
[3564.92 → 3565.58] mimic
[3565.58 → 3566.66] that hurt
[3566.66 → 3567.36] and pass
[3567.36 → 3568.14] along
[3568.14 → 3569.08] that cruelty.
[3570.06 → 3570.44] So you
[3570.44 → 3571.68] start to,
[3571.88 → 3572.62] you receive
[3572.62 → 3572.96] that hurt
[3572.96 → 3573.20] and then you
[3573.20 → 3573.80] start to act
[3573.80 → 3574.28] like that
[3574.28 → 3574.78] yourself.
[3575.50 → 3576.22] You start
[3576.22 → 3576.58] to hurt
[3576.58 → 3577.22] other people,
[3577.28 → 3577.72] that's the
[3577.72 → 3578.40] real danger.
[3579.48 → 3580.08] And in a
[3580.08 → 3580.34] way,
[3580.46 → 3581.28] that is the
[3581.28 → 3581.94] inevitable
[3581.94 → 3582.64] pattern
[3582.64 → 3584.32] of sinful
[3584.32 → 3585.32] human behaviour
[3585.32 → 3586.58] unless the
[3586.58 → 3587.34] grace of
[3587.34 → 3587.92] God
[3587.92 → 3588.44] and the
[3588.44 → 3588.94] gospel of
[3588.94 → 3589.60] Jesus Christ
[3589.60 → 3590.82] intervenes
[3590.82 → 3591.72] as it does
[3591.72 → 3591.98] here.
[3593.60 → 3594.28] So he
[3594.28 → 3595.04] turns his
[3595.04 → 3595.92] eyes to
[3595.92 → 3596.14] God,
[3596.20 → 3596.68] he cries
[3596.68 → 3597.08] out to
[3597.08 → 3597.48] God,
[3598.08 → 3598.46] and he
[3598.46 → 3598.96] cries out
[3598.96 → 3599.62] for justice.
[3600.54 → 3600.82] And so
[3600.82 → 3601.24] here's the
[3601.24 → 3601.84] good news,
[3602.24 → 3602.88] you can do
[3602.88 → 3603.28] that too.
[3603.38 → 3603.70] You can
[3603.70 → 3604.56] pour out
[3604.56 → 3605.32] all your
[3605.32 → 3606.10] honest feelings
[3606.10 → 3606.58] to God.
[3607.58 → 3607.76] Right?
[3607.84 → 3608.44] This psalm
[3608.44 → 3609.04] is an
[3609.04 → 3609.94] invitation for
[3609.94 → 3610.28] you this
[3610.28 → 3610.72] morning to
[3610.72 → 3611.70] take all
[3611.70 → 3612.28] the bitterness
[3612.28 → 3613.12] of all
[3613.12 → 3613.60] of those,
[3614.34 → 3614.88] all of that
[3614.88 → 3615.14] you have
[3615.14 → 3615.62] swallowed
[3615.62 → 3616.54] over time,
[3616.58 → 3616.92] all of
[3616.92 → 3617.30] those things
[3617.30 → 3617.58] that you've
[3617.58 → 3618.00] kept in
[3618.00 → 3618.50] your heart
[3618.50 → 3619.10] that have
[3619.10 → 3619.84] been said
[3619.84 → 3620.82] to you
[3620.82 → 3621.40] or about
[3621.40 → 3621.70] you,
[3621.82 → 3622.60] and leave
[3622.60 → 3623.00] them in
[3623.00 → 3623.62] God's hands.
[3623.68 → 3624.22] And sometimes
[3624.22 → 3624.66] maybe it's
[3624.66 → 3624.98] kind of
[3624.98 → 3626.06] confession where
[3626.06 → 3626.44] you say,
[3626.54 → 3626.74] God,
[3626.78 → 3627.16] would you
[3627.16 → 3629.20] shoot sharp
[3629.20 → 3629.76] arrows at
[3629.76 → 3630.24] my enemies?
[3632.00 → 3632.56] So maybe
[3632.56 → 3632.86] that's a
[3632.86 → 3633.32] confession,
[3634.12 → 3634.52] maybe we
[3634.52 → 3634.94] shouldn't feel
[3634.94 → 3635.32] that way,
[3635.38 → 3635.72] but I think
[3635.72 → 3636.44] also what
[3636.44 → 3637.08] is here
[3637.08 → 3637.96] is a cry
[3637.96 → 3638.50] for justice.
[3638.66 → 3638.84] God,
[3638.94 → 3639.78] I leave
[3639.78 → 3640.06] it in
[3640.06 → 3640.76] your hands,
[3640.80 → 3641.08] you know
[3641.08 → 3641.38] what is
[3641.38 → 3641.76] right.
[3643.22 → 3643.98] So pouring
[3643.98 → 3644.66] it out
[3644.66 → 3645.30] to God
[3645.30 → 3645.66] is so
[3645.66 → 3646.26] much safer
[3646.26 → 3647.26] than pouring
[3647.26 → 3647.56] it out
[3647.56 → 3647.84] on your
[3647.84 → 3648.18] enemies,
[3649.08 → 3650.24] or keeping
[3650.24 → 3650.68] it trapped
[3650.68 → 3650.98] in your
[3650.98 → 3651.34] heart,
[3651.64 → 3652.54] where it
[3652.54 → 3653.02] does damage
[3653.02 → 3653.66] to yourself.
[3655.04 → 3655.96] So between
[3655.96 → 3656.50] you and
[3656.50 → 3656.98] God,
[3658.00 → 3658.64] the psalm is
[3658.64 → 3659.36] the invitation
[3659.36 → 3660.32] to have
[3660.32 → 3661.14] confidential
[3661.14 → 3661.72] dealings
[3661.72 → 3662.18] with God.
[3663.18 → 3663.80] You can
[3663.80 → 3664.36] come before
[3664.36 → 3666.06] him and
[3666.06 → 3666.90] be honest,
[3667.02 → 3667.50] open up your
[3667.50 → 3667.92] heart to
[3667.92 → 3668.14] him.
[3668.60 → 3669.18] He knows
[3669.18 → 3670.52] what you're
[3670.52 → 3671.16] feeling and
[3671.16 → 3671.42] thinking,
[3671.50 → 3671.86] he knows what
[3671.86 → 3672.24] you're going
[3672.24 → 3672.52] through.
[3673.36 → 3674.00] You can
[3674.00 → 3674.58] express your
[3674.58 → 3675.10] frustration,
[3675.28 → 3675.76] your anger.
[3676.60 → 3677.20] You can
[3677.20 → 3677.86] cry out to
[3677.86 → 3678.26] him to
[3678.26 → 3678.60] make things
[3678.60 → 3679.00] right.
[3680.08 → 3681.06] That's how
[3681.06 → 3682.24] you can
[3682.24 → 3683.12] emerge on
[3683.12 → 3683.54] the other
[3683.54 → 3684.00] side,
[3684.62 → 3685.30] by crying
[3685.30 → 3685.62] out to
[3685.62 → 3685.92] God.
[3687.16 → 3687.48] You know,
[3687.54 → 3688.16] this isn't a
[3688.16 → 3688.50] one-off
[3688.50 → 3689.16] experience that
[3689.16 → 3689.56] we just do
[3689.56 → 3689.84] it, and it's
[3689.84 → 3690.10] over.
[3690.48 → 3691.04] This is a
[3691.04 → 3691.52] journey of
[3691.52 → 3691.92] peace.
[3692.40 → 3692.78] It's a
[3692.78 → 3694.06] journey of
[3694.06 → 3694.66] forgiving our
[3694.66 → 3695.02] enemies,
[3695.74 → 3696.28] and it's a
[3696.28 → 3696.86] journey to
[3696.86 → 3697.54] see that I
[3697.54 → 3698.46] need forgiveness
[3698.46 → 3699.68] just as much.
[3700.26 → 3701.42] I too have
[3701.42 → 3702.12] hurt people with
[3702.12 → 3702.66] my words.
[3704.54 → 3705.26] So then he
[3705.26 → 3705.66] goes on,
[3705.70 → 3706.12] he says in
[3706.12 → 3706.74] verses 6 and
[3706.74 → 3707.12] 7,
[3707.72 → 3708.68] too long have
[3708.68 → 3709.42] I lived among
[3709.42 → 3709.98] those who
[3709.98 → 3710.66] hate peace.
[3711.24 → 3711.98] I am for
[3711.98 → 3712.44] peace,
[3712.88 → 3713.38] but when I
[3713.38 → 3713.94] speak they
[3713.94 → 3714.56] are for war.
[3715.58 → 3716.30] This is a
[3716.30 → 3716.62] lament,
[3717.54 → 3717.68] right?
[3717.74 → 3718.48] It's a longing
[3718.48 → 3719.80] for peace.
[3720.50 → 3720.94] It's a longing
[3720.94 → 3722.42] for what he's
[3722.42 → 3723.30] not experiencing,
[3723.68 → 3724.60] that there is
[3724.60 → 3725.00] no peace,
[3725.08 → 3725.60] there's war,
[3725.80 → 3726.12] but it's a
[3726.12 → 3726.58] longing for
[3726.58 → 3726.92] peace.
[3727.24 → 3727.54] And this
[3727.54 → 3727.92] word for
[3727.92 → 3728.44] peace is
[3728.44 → 3728.80] shalom.
[3728.80 → 3730.46] And it
[3730.46 → 3731.34] always refers
[3731.34 → 3731.90] to more
[3731.90 → 3732.26] than just
[3732.26 → 3733.12] a ceasefire.
[3733.74 → 3734.18] Shalom
[3734.18 → 3734.98] means
[3734.98 → 3735.74] flourishing.
[3736.42 → 3736.84] It means
[3736.84 → 3737.18] for the
[3737.18 → 3737.96] healing of
[3737.96 → 3738.58] relationships.
[3738.82 → 3739.72] It's a
[3739.72 → 3740.06] prayer for
[3740.06 → 3740.56] the healing
[3740.56 → 3741.06] of God
[3741.06 → 3741.50] to come,
[3741.58 → 3741.82] for the
[3741.82 → 3742.42] blessings of
[3742.42 → 3742.66] God to
[3742.66 → 3742.96] be poured
[3742.96 → 3743.28] out,
[3743.70 → 3744.28] for things
[3744.28 → 3744.68] to be
[3744.68 → 3745.90] made right,
[3746.22 → 3746.78] to be
[3746.78 → 3747.20] healed.
[3747.70 → 3748.28] That's what
[3748.28 → 3748.68] the psalmist
[3748.68 → 3749.12] is longing
[3749.12 → 3749.46] for.
[3749.76 → 3750.26] And it's
[3750.26 → 3750.94] a lament
[3750.94 → 3751.52] that this
[3751.52 → 3752.04] is not
[3752.04 → 3752.68] in sight
[3752.68 → 3753.20] right now.
[3753.20 → 3754.76] I am
[3754.76 → 3755.40] for peace,
[3755.86 → 3756.46] but when
[3756.46 → 3757.12] I speak,
[3757.72 → 3758.12] they are
[3758.12 → 3758.66] for war.
[3759.70 → 3760.26] But friends,
[3760.34 → 3760.68] I have good
[3760.68 → 3761.06] news for
[3761.06 → 3761.28] you.
[3762.12 → 3762.66] And it's
[3762.66 → 3763.44] that we
[3763.44 → 3764.66] can sing
[3764.66 → 3765.48] with this
[3765.48 → 3766.56] psalm not
[3766.56 → 3767.36] only about
[3767.36 → 3768.02] our own
[3768.02 → 3768.84] longing for
[3768.84 → 3769.28] peace,
[3769.42 → 3770.00] but we
[3770.00 → 3770.76] can sing
[3770.76 → 3771.18] of the
[3771.18 → 3772.04] coming of
[3772.04 → 3772.68] the Prince
[3772.68 → 3773.52] of Peace,
[3774.22 → 3774.98] Jesus Christ.
[3776.14 → 3776.84] Because you
[3776.84 → 3776.96] see,
[3777.02 → 3777.50] what we find
[3777.50 → 3777.98] in Jesus
[3777.98 → 3778.48] is that
[3778.48 → 3779.64] justice of
[3779.64 → 3780.10] God that
[3780.10 → 3780.44] we long
[3780.44 → 3780.72] for,
[3780.88 → 3781.32] and the
[3781.32 → 3781.88] peace of
[3781.88 → 3782.24] God that
[3782.24 → 3782.60] we pray
[3782.60 → 3782.96] for,
[3783.20 → 3783.98] come together
[3783.98 → 3784.52] perfectly.
[3784.88 → 3785.32] They come
[3785.32 → 3785.96] together in
[3785.96 → 3786.24] Jesus.
[3786.80 → 3787.34] And that is
[3787.34 → 3787.66] what the
[3787.66 → 3788.12] cross is
[3788.12 → 3788.62] all about.
[3789.58 → 3789.86] It's that
[3789.86 → 3790.32] God is
[3790.32 → 3790.80] just,
[3791.10 → 3791.30] and the
[3791.30 → 3792.04] consequences
[3792.04 → 3792.90] of sin,
[3793.18 → 3793.58] of all
[3793.58 → 3794.46] the lies,
[3795.60 → 3796.28] the deceitfulness
[3796.28 → 3796.84] of the
[3796.84 → 3797.20] world,
[3797.56 → 3798.36] was poured
[3798.36 → 3799.24] out on
[3799.24 → 3799.56] him.
[3799.64 → 3799.96] It was
[3799.96 → 3800.52] all poured
[3800.52 → 3800.84] out on
[3800.84 → 3801.10] Jesus.
[3801.72 → 3802.22] The judgment
[3802.22 → 3802.82] for my
[3802.82 → 3803.34] sin and
[3803.34 → 3803.76] yours,
[3804.16 → 3804.46] Jesus
[3804.46 → 3805.20] freely
[3805.20 → 3805.94] bore on
[3805.94 → 3806.54] the cross,
[3807.18 → 3808.12] so that
[3808.12 → 3808.82] when we
[3808.82 → 3809.10] put our
[3809.10 → 3809.52] faith in
[3809.52 → 3809.72] God,
[3809.80 → 3810.12] we can
[3810.12 → 3810.72] have peace
[3810.72 → 3811.30] with God,
[3811.50 → 3812.02] so that we
[3812.02 → 3812.28] can have
[3812.28 → 3812.74] peace with
[3812.74 → 3813.28] one another,
[3813.90 → 3814.46] and that we
[3814.46 → 3814.96] can,
[3815.26 → 3815.74] in the end,
[3815.82 → 3816.98] experience this
[3816.98 → 3817.58] flourishing,
[3817.68 → 3819.16] this peace that
[3819.16 → 3820.06] Jesus came to
[3820.06 → 3820.40] bring,
[3820.90 → 3821.50] and that he came
[3821.50 → 3822.14] to restore to
[3822.14 → 3822.56] the world.
[3823.20 → 3824.16] So when you and
[3824.16 → 3825.14] I put our faith in
[3825.14 → 3825.44] Jesus,
[3825.80 → 3826.88] we will then be
[3826.88 → 3827.44] able to,
[3827.60 → 3827.90] like the
[3827.90 → 3828.22] psalmist,
[3828.34 → 3828.60] say,
[3829.38 → 3830.22] I am for
[3830.22 → 3830.62] peace.
[3830.76 → 3831.42] Not because of
[3831.42 → 3831.66] our own
[3831.66 → 3832.04] righteousness,
[3832.88 → 3833.72] but because we
[3833.72 → 3834.52] have been united
[3834.52 → 3835.44] to the God of
[3835.44 → 3835.68] peace.
[3835.74 → 3836.40] We can say with
[3836.40 → 3836.56] him,
[3836.80 → 3837.38] I am for
[3837.38 → 3837.78] peace.
[3837.78 → 3837.86] peace.
[3839.10 → 3839.62] Literally,
[3840.22 → 3840.80] it's,
[3840.86 → 3841.40] in the Hebrew,
[3842.04 → 3842.38] I,
[3843.10 → 3843.56] peace.
[3845.10 → 3845.58] I,
[3846.00 → 3846.36] shalom.
[3847.60 → 3848.04] He has
[3848.04 → 3849.22] internalized the
[3849.22 → 3849.74] peace of
[3849.74 → 3850.08] God.
[3850.84 → 3851.24] I,
[3851.72 → 3852.04] peace.
[3853.04 → 3853.64] And when we
[3853.64 → 3854.18] receive the
[3854.18 → 3854.54] peace of
[3854.54 → 3854.76] God,
[3854.84 → 3855.40] when we
[3855.40 → 3856.10] internalize that
[3856.10 → 3856.40] peace,
[3856.94 → 3857.52] it changes
[3857.52 → 3857.86] us,
[3857.94 → 3858.50] it transforms
[3858.50 → 3858.94] us.
[3860.14 → 3860.46] So,
[3860.72 → 3861.14] for the
[3861.14 → 3861.52] psalmist,
[3861.64 → 3862.46] his disposition
[3862.46 → 3863.14] to his
[3863.14 → 3864.52] enemies is
[3864.52 → 3865.16] now one of
[3865.16 → 3865.66] peace,
[3865.66 → 3866.28] right?
[3866.34 → 3866.96] Despite what
[3866.96 → 3867.58] they have said
[3867.58 → 3868.30] about him,
[3868.50 → 3869.00] what they have
[3869.00 → 3869.76] done to him,
[3870.24 → 3871.02] he is giving
[3871.02 → 3872.12] up the right
[3872.12 → 3873.54] to play judge,
[3873.74 → 3873.98] jury,
[3874.08 → 3874.92] and executioner.
[3875.80 → 3876.28] So,
[3876.36 → 3877.16] any response
[3877.16 → 3877.84] he makes is
[3877.84 → 3878.32] now not
[3878.32 → 3878.86] vengeful,
[3879.40 → 3879.96] but peaceful.
[3880.54 → 3881.22] Even for
[3881.22 → 3881.78] their good.
[3883.04 → 3883.60] Not that
[3883.60 → 3884.24] that has
[3884.24 → 3884.82] changed who
[3884.82 → 3885.52] they are yet.
[3886.38 → 3886.92] They're still
[3886.92 → 3887.52] for war.
[3888.52 → 3889.04] But he has
[3889.04 → 3889.50] left them in
[3889.50 → 3890.12] God's hands.
[3891.32 → 3891.76] He's taken
[3891.76 → 3892.14] the most
[3892.14 → 3892.94] important step
[3892.94 → 3893.38] in dealing
[3893.38 → 3893.98] with lies and
[3893.98 → 3894.26] deceit,
[3894.36 → 3895.22] which is to
[3895.22 → 3896.02] put himself
[3896.02 → 3896.76] right before
[3896.76 → 3897.18] God,
[3897.74 → 3898.44] where he can
[3898.44 → 3899.44] then hear
[3899.44 → 3899.90] and listen
[3899.90 → 3900.26] to the
[3900.26 → 3900.62] truth.
[3901.54 → 3901.90] So,
[3901.96 → 3902.52] he's no longer
[3902.52 → 3903.30] defined by
[3903.30 → 3904.02] the lies that
[3904.02 → 3904.46] people say
[3904.46 → 3905.00] about him.
[3905.26 → 3906.00] He no longer
[3906.00 → 3906.78] falls for the
[3906.78 → 3907.78] lies of a
[3907.78 → 3908.30] culture that
[3908.30 → 3908.92] simply doesn't
[3908.92 → 3909.50] know God.
[3910.52 → 3910.92] Instead,
[3911.08 → 3911.62] he's defined
[3911.62 → 3912.32] by the truth
[3912.32 → 3912.84] of what God
[3912.84 → 3913.54] says about him,
[3913.58 → 3913.94] that you are
[3913.94 → 3915.44] beloved and
[3915.44 → 3916.50] loved and
[3916.50 → 3916.84] blessed.
[3917.98 → 3918.44] And now he
[3918.44 → 3918.96] has a longing
[3918.96 → 3919.56] for the whole
[3919.56 → 3920.30] world to
[3920.30 → 3921.08] experience the
[3921.08 → 3921.64] peace of God.
[3922.66 → 3922.98] And the
[3922.98 → 3923.38] psalmist's
[3923.38 → 3924.06] longing for
[3924.06 → 3924.44] shalom,
[3924.66 → 3925.12] for peace,
[3925.12 → 3925.40] and for
[3925.40 → 3925.96] flourishing,
[3926.40 → 3927.64] that's what
[3927.64 → 3928.24] we long
[3928.24 → 3928.96] for today.
[3930.34 → 3931.02] We don't
[3931.02 → 3931.58] always see
[3931.58 → 3931.82] it.
[3933.30 → 3934.16] There are so
[3934.16 → 3934.82] many parts
[3934.82 → 3935.14] of this
[3935.14 → 3936.50] world in
[3936.50 → 3936.84] darkness.
[3938.12 → 3938.82] But we
[3938.82 → 3939.64] know that
[3939.64 → 3940.42] peace has
[3940.42 → 3941.76] dawned in
[3941.76 → 3942.06] Jesus.
[3942.84 → 3943.22] And the
[3943.22 → 3943.90] promise renewal
[3943.90 → 3944.48] of all things
[3944.48 → 3945.26] has begun.
[3945.34 → 3946.04] And one day,
[3946.24 → 3946.96] when Jesus
[3946.96 → 3947.44] returns,
[3947.48 → 3947.80] it will be
[3947.80 → 3948.24] complete.
[3949.16 → 3949.54] Shalom,
[3950.08 → 3950.62] flourishing,
[3951.08 → 3951.52] healing,
[3951.52 → 3953.36] will fill
[3953.36 → 3953.80] the whole
[3953.80 → 3955.08] earth as
[3955.08 → 3955.56] the waters
[3955.56 → 3956.04] cover the
[3956.04 → 3956.34] seas.
[3957.60 → 3957.92] In the
[3957.92 → 3958.20] meantime,
[3958.32 → 3958.44] though,
[3958.48 → 3958.74] we are
[3958.74 → 3959.28] people who
[3959.28 → 3959.72] are sent
[3959.72 → 3960.18] into the
[3960.18 → 3960.48] world.
[3961.62 → 3961.74] Right?
[3961.90 → 3962.62] This world,
[3963.72 → 3964.84] this is where
[3964.84 → 3965.56] not everyone
[3965.56 → 3966.16] is on the
[3966.16 → 3966.54] side of
[3966.54 → 3967.02] peace,
[3967.42 → 3968.06] but we
[3968.06 → 3968.80] are sent
[3968.80 → 3969.54] into the
[3969.54 → 3970.48] world to
[3970.48 → 3971.64] sing the
[3971.64 → 3972.16] message of
[3972.16 → 3972.50] peace.
[3973.50 → 3974.28] That is our
[3974.28 → 3974.92] mission today.
[3975.38 → 3975.94] We're not to
[3975.94 → 3976.66] settle in
[3976.66 → 3977.16] Meshach and
[3977.16 → 3977.56] Kadar.
[3977.64 → 3978.08] If we do,
[3978.18 → 3978.56] we are
[3978.56 → 3980.30] conforming to
[3980.30 → 3980.74] the lies of
[3980.74 → 3981.24] our culture.
[3981.72 → 3982.50] But instead,
[3982.86 → 3983.46] believing the
[3983.46 → 3983.82] truth of
[3983.82 → 3984.12] God,
[3984.66 → 3985.10] we are to
[3985.10 → 3986.72] sing to
[3986.72 → 3987.08] God the
[3987.08 → 3987.46] truth,
[3987.76 → 3988.36] to this
[3988.36 → 3988.66] world,
[3988.76 → 3989.26] the truth of
[3989.26 → 3989.58] who God
[3989.58 → 3989.86] is.
[3990.58 → 3990.92] So let me
[3990.92 → 3991.22] pray that
[3991.22 → 3991.52] God would
[3991.52 → 3992.02] help us.
[3997.06 → 3997.46] This
[3997.46 → 3998.54] prayer comes
[3998.54 → 3998.92] from the
[3998.92 → 3999.38] Lift Your
[3999.38 → 3999.64] Heart
[3999.64 → 4000.24] hymnals.
[4001.64 → 4002.10] God of
[4002.10 → 4002.60] peace,
[4003.24 → 4003.48] in the
[4003.48 → 4004.04] middle of a
[4004.04 → 4005.38] world filled
[4005.38 → 4006.20] with warfare
[4006.20 → 4007.00] and violence.
[4007.76 → 4008.62] We pray for
[4008.62 → 4009.22] the coming of
[4009.22 → 4009.54] the Prince
[4009.54 → 4010.00] of Peace.
[4011.28 → 4012.32] We cling to
[4012.32 → 4012.94] Your promise
[4012.94 → 4013.34] that You
[4013.34 → 4013.86] will break
[4013.86 → 4014.32] the bow
[4014.32 → 4014.94] and shatter
[4014.94 → 4015.46] the spear.
[4016.86 → 4017.86] We long
[4017.86 → 4018.88] to live up
[4018.88 → 4019.44] to our
[4019.44 → 4020.62] calling as
[4020.62 → 4021.48] instruments of
[4021.48 → 4021.84] peace.
[4022.68 → 4023.48] Through our
[4023.48 → 4024.22] prayers and
[4024.22 → 4024.82] through our
[4024.82 → 4025.44] actions,
[4026.36 → 4026.88] help us to
[4026.88 → 4027.74] plant seeds
[4027.74 → 4028.80] of peace.
[4029.36 → 4030.20] Then by Your
[4030.20 → 4030.94] Spirit, turn
[4030.94 → 4031.28] them into
[4031.28 → 4031.96] blossoms of
[4031.96 → 4033.54] hope, the
[4033.54 → 4034.14] fruit of
[4034.14 → 4034.54] righteousness.
[4034.54 → 4034.80] holiness.
[4035.78 → 4036.58] We pray in
[4036.58 → 4037.20] Jesus' name.
[4038.10 → 4038.40] Amen.
[4040.90 → 4041.42] So let's
[4041.42 → 4042.00] sing a song of
[4042.00 → 4042.52] response.
[4042.84 → 4043.40] You can feel free
[4043.40 → 4044.00] to stand if you
[4044.00 → 4044.58] want or remain
[4044.58 → 4044.98] seated.
[4045.36 → 4046.08] It's totally up to
[4046.08 → 4046.24] you.
[4046.24 → 4046.46] Amen.
[4046.46 → 4046.90] Amen.
[4046.90 → 4048.90] Amen.
[4076.90 → 4079.90] We will be the night.
[4080.62 → 4083.08] We will walk around Him.
[4083.28 → 4084.90] We will be by our side.
[4085.84 → 4088.20] You will go before us.
[4088.38 → 4090.18] You will lead the way.
[4090.74 → 4093.26] We have found a refuge.
[4093.44 → 4094.90] Only you can save.
[4097.10 → 4098.90] Sing with joy now.
[4099.82 → 4101.90] Our God is for us.
[4101.90 → 4105.90] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[4106.90 → 4109.70] Raise your voice now.
[4109.90 → 4111.70] Our love is greater.
[4112.14 → 4117.90] Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[4126.42 → 4129.06] Even when I stumble.
[4129.52 → 4131.60] Even when I fall.
[4131.60 → 4134.60] Even when I turn back.
[4134.60 → 4137.00] Still your love is sure.
[4137.40 → 4139.52] You will not abandon.
[4140.02 → 4141.60] You will not forsake.
[4142.56 → 4147.60] You will cheer me onward with never-ending grace.
[4148.98 → 4151.40] Sing with joy now.
[4151.40 → 4153.40] Our God is for us.
[4153.40 → 4153.82] Our God is for us.
[4153.82 → 4158.82] The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[4158.82 → 4161.52] Raise your voice now.
[4161.52 → 4163.60] No love is greater.
[4163.60 → 4169.40] Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[4169.40 → 4171.40] And guide our God can separate us.
[4171.40 → 4186.24] Hell and death will not defeat us.
[4186.24 → 4190.52] He will leave His Son to free us.
[4190.74 → 4194.50] Holds me in His love.
[4194.50 → 4200.00] Neither I nor death can separate us
[4200.00 → 4204.84] Hell and hell will not defeat us
[4204.84 → 4209.28] He who gave His Son to free us
[4209.28 → 4213.44] Holds me in his eye
[4213.44 → 4221.06] Sing with joy now our God is for us
[4221.06 → 4225.06] The Father's love is a strong and bad and gorgeous
[4225.68 → 4230.26] Raise your voice now your love is greater
[4230.26 → 4236.90] You can stand against us if our God is for us
[4236.90 → 4243.84] You may be seated
[4243.84 → 4248.82] So
[4248.82 → 4254.22] You know the sad news that was
[4254.22 → 4257.20] We've been hearing this week was the
[4257.20 → 4260.18] The grave of 215
[4260.18 → 4265.10] Indigenous children
[4265.10 → 4268.22] That was uncovered in Kamloops
[4268.22 → 4271.38] Our denomination has prepared a prayer
[4271.38 → 4272.48] That they've asked the churches
[4272.48 → 4274.34] To pray together
[4274.34 → 4276.92] So that's what we'll do now in our community prayer
[4276.92 → 4289.96] Creator
[4289.96 → 4293.22] Acquainted with all of our griefs
[4293.22 → 4295.38] It is a crime
[4295.38 → 4296.44] A loss
[4296.44 → 4298.18] A shock
[4298.18 → 4298.98] An evil
[4298.98 → 4301.00] And a tragedy
[4301.00 → 4301.68] All in one
[4301.68 → 4305.92] For 215 lives to be cut short
[4305.92 → 4308.70] To have to grieve deaths
[4308.70 → 4311.00] That did not have to be
[4311.00 → 4314.20] The disregard for life
[4314.20 → 4317.22] In clear violation of your good commandment
[4317.22 → 4321.22] O Christ where is the justice
[4321.22 → 4323.10] That could ever make this right
[4323.10 → 4326.48] When no one can restore what has been taken
[4326.48 → 4331.84] We're ever mindful of the harm that can come to others we love
[4331.84 → 4335.84] We surely cannot change what happened or make sense of it
[4335.84 → 4338.22] Or find some lesson in it
[4338.88 → 4343.30] For our indigenous brothers and sisters
[4343.30 → 4347.02] We pray that you would be their shield and defender
[4347.02 → 4349.50] Hold them in this time
[4349.50 → 4352.34] Hold them through this long dark night
[4352.34 → 4355.14] When death's shadow obstructs the light
[4355.14 → 4359.96] Carry them through this veil of sorrows
[4359.96 → 4363.32] Deliver them to higher ground
[4363.32 → 4366.24] Let justice roll down O Christ
[4366.24 → 4371.46] Help us to see where we have sinned individually and collectively
[4371.46 → 4374.68] To identify the causes of injustice
[4374.68 → 4376.38] And to move towards change
[4376.38 → 4381.88] We are too weak to walk this path alone
[4381.88 → 4384.56] Or to power through by force of our own will
[4384.56 → 4387.36] So send your Holy Spirit to strengthen us now
[4387.36 → 4391.54] We know, O God, that you would have
[4391.54 → 4395.06] That you would have us be completely honest
[4395.06 → 4396.20] In our words to you
[4396.20 → 4400.32] Voicing even those discouragements
[4400.32 → 4402.00] And volatile emotions
[4402.00 → 4404.94] And you are more than able to bear their weight
[4404.94 → 4407.98] Never wavering in your constant love and care for us
[4407.98 → 4411.58] For you, O God, watched one you love
[4411.58 → 4413.48] Die violently, your own son
[4413.48 → 4416.34] You sympathize with us
[4416.34 → 4419.22] So we will freely speak to you
[4419.22 → 4421.28] The depths of what we feel
[4421.28 → 4424.02] We would be honest in our pain
[4424.02 → 4426.50] Help us not to become
[4426.50 → 4429.28] The walking sum of all our pain
[4429.28 → 4431.64] Now let us come to you
[4431.64 → 4434.26] Uncovering these wounds as often as we need to
[4434.26 → 4437.08] And learning how to offer them to you
[4437.08 → 4439.84] That you might minister your grace to us
[4439.84 → 4444.22] Now shape us, Lord, through this ache and sorrow
[4444.22 → 4445.14] And awareness
[4445.14 → 4446.58] Into ones
[4446.58 → 4450.20] Who do not let pain turn into apathy
[4450.20 → 4454.32] But who instead are made more tender over time
[4454.32 → 4457.04] Help us to work towards reconciliation
[4457.04 → 4460.24] And so let us grow in our love for others, O Christ
[4460.24 → 4463.62] True justice is in your hands
[4463.62 → 4467.44] Especially when our human systems get it wrong
[4467.44 → 4471.84] Still your eternal judgments will be right
[4471.84 → 4476.40] Help us to hold onto the light of your love
[4476.40 → 4480.48] Even in the darkness of the legacy of residential schools
[4480.48 → 4485.28] Now make your redeeming mercies manifest, O Christ
[4485.28 → 4488.16] Take away the evil of colonization
[4488.16 → 4490.80] And by the movements of your spirit
[4490.80 → 4494.78] Heal the relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous people
[4494.78 → 4498.64] Make a grander narrative display
[4498.64 → 4500.82] Of beauty, grace, and restoration
[4500.82 → 4506.32] O Holy Spirit, hover now over the chaos of this broken world
[4506.32 → 4509.40] This broken situation in our broken hearts
[4509.40 → 4514.96] And from them call forth new mercies and new hope
[4514.96 → 4518.12] Let your eternal glories rise
[4518.12 → 4519.78] Radiant as a dawning sun
[4519.78 → 4521.74] Dispelling a black and tragic night
[4521.74 → 4524.28] From this very heart of death, O God
[4524.28 → 4525.88] Call forth shalom
[4525.88 → 4527.30] For everyone
[4527.30 → 4528.88] In everlasting life
[4528.88 → 4530.00] Amen
[4530.00 → 4537.60] So brothers and sisters
[4537.60 → 4541.92] I invite you to receive the Lord's blessing upon you
[4541.92 → 4543.14] May rise
[4543.14 → 4545.76] I invite you to stretch out your hands
[4545.76 → 4548.10] As a gesture of openness to the Lord's blessing
[4548.10 → 4552.98] For his true words spoken upon you
[4552.98 → 4555.80] May our Heavenly Father
[4555.80 → 4557.72] The God of hope
[4557.72 → 4560.02] Fill you with all joy and peace
[4560.02 → 4560.94] As you trust in him
[4560.94 → 4563.38] So that you may overflow with hope
[4563.38 → 4565.76] By the power of the Holy Spirit
[4565.76 → 4566.82] Amen
[4566.82 → 4590.56] Be my God, God of Abraham
[4590.56 → 4593.10] Lead me by your hand
[4593.10 → 4596.02] Who are strong and wise
[4596.02 → 4598.62] I invite you to trust in you
[4598.62 → 4600.44] And in all I do
[4600.44 → 4603.82] Bring you honour and grace
[4603.82 → 4608.06] The God of Abraham
[4608.06 → 4611.12] Lead me by your hand
[4611.12 → 4613.80] Who are strong and wise
[4613.80 → 4616.24] I invite you to trust in you
[4616.24 → 4618.20] And in all I do
[4618.20 → 4621.56] Bring you honour and grace
[4621.56 → 4626.00] How I love you
[4626.00 → 4631.28] Good and mighty things
[4631.28 → 4634.66] You are me, Lord
[4634.66 → 4637.16] Through the ages
[4637.16 → 4640.70] You never change
[4640.70 → 4648.48] Be my God in the dark of night
[4648.48 → 4650.54] Set all things to fly
[4650.54 → 4653.46] You are hope and truth
[4653.46 → 4653.86] You are hope and truth
[4653.86 → 4655.92] I want to trust in you
[4655.92 → 4657.88] And in all I do
[4657.88 → 4660.26] Bring you honour and grace
[4660.26 → 4665.74] How I love you
[4665.74 → 4669.98] Great and mighty things
[4669.98 → 4674.26] You are me, Lord
[4674.26 → 4677.22] Through the ages
[4677.22 → 4677.98] To the ages
[4677.98 → 4680.80] You have never changed
[4680.80 → 4686.84] Be my God
[4686.84 → 4688.06] Go the road ahead
[4688.06 → 4691.50] The road ahead is real instead
[4691.50 → 4694.50] You are just and good
[4694.50 → 4697.10] But you trust in you
[4697.10 → 4698.92] And in all I do
[4698.92 → 4704.02] You honour and praise
[4704.02 → 4707.92] How I love you
[4707.92 → 4711.92] Great and mighty deeply
[4711.92 → 4715.76] You are faithful
[4715.76 → 4720.10] Through the ages you never change.
[4720.10 → 4724.10] I love you.
[4725.04 → 4731.00] You are faithful.
[4732.76 → 4739.10] Through the ages you never change.
[4745.76 → 4764.76] You are just now making your way outside the doors.
[4764.76 → 4765.76] Yep.
[4775.76 → 4805.74] You are faithful.
[4805.74 → 4835.72] You are faithful.
[4835.74 → 4837.74] You are faithful.
[4837.74 → 4841.74] You are faithful.
[4841.74 → 4845.74] You are faithful.
[4845.74 → 4847.74] You are faithful.
[4847.74 → 4851.74] You are faithful.
