[586.00 → 603.56] Good evening and Merry Christmas.
[605.38 → 606.92] Thank you. I heard one person.
[608.22 → 610.44] Merry Christmas to you too. Thank you.
[611.48 → 614.96] Welcome to our Christmas Eve service at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[614.96 → 617.26] My name is Jason True. I'm the lead pastor here.
[618.12 → 622.38] And I welcome you, especially if you are new with us and just joining us.
[622.56 → 625.66] I'm especially glad to see you here with us tonight.
[626.78 → 636.34] So beloved in Christ, in this season of Christmas, let it be our great joy to hear once more the message of the angels,
[636.94 → 641.12] to go in heart and mind to Bethlehem,
[641.12 → 647.86] and to see this thing which has come to pass, the Son of God lying in a manger.
[649.28 → 657.26] So tonight, may our hearts and our hopes soar as we hear this story once again.
[657.26 → 661.76] And let us make this place glad about our carols of praise.
[663.06 → 666.68] And so tonight, we will be singing many favourite carols.
[666.84 → 672.00] We'll also be hearing the story of Jesus' birth through the Gospel of Luke.
[672.52 → 679.22] And we'll be hearing some narrations of special figures in this birth story,
[679.76 → 682.18] sharing their own story and what they would have experienced.
[682.18 → 688.18] But first, because this of all things would rejoice Jesus' heart,
[688.80 → 694.36] I want to invite us to a time of prayer, of silent prayer.
[694.76 → 698.88] Before we begin this evening, each one of us, kind of in our own hearts,
[699.74 → 702.02] can still ourselves before the Lord.
[702.94 → 704.20] And let's pray for a few things.
[704.26 → 707.04] And I'll say the prayer, and then I'll just give you a moment to pray.
[707.04 → 709.80] Let us pray for the needs of the world,
[710.24 → 713.64] for peace on earth that he came to save,
[714.22 → 717.42] for goodwill, for love and unity,
[717.60 → 720.72] and the one church over which he alone is Lord.
[721.30 → 721.94] Let's pray.
[721.94 → 722.94] Let us pray.
[722.94 → 723.94] Let us pray.
[734.16 → 739.08] And let us remember in his name the helpless and the hungry,
[739.88 → 741.86] the poor and the oppressed,
[742.42 → 744.90] the sick and the sorrowing,
[745.44 → 747.70] the lonely and the unloved,
[748.50 → 751.04] the elderly and the little children.
[751.94 → 769.04] Finally, let us remember before God all of those who rejoice with us this Christmas,
[769.70 → 770.92] but upon another shore.
[771.78 → 773.22] And in a greater light,
[773.92 → 775.60] that great cloud of witnesses,
[775.82 → 777.64] that multitude which no one can number,
[778.32 → 780.62] whose hope was in the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[780.62 → 781.62] Let us pray for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[794.42 → 798.38] These prayers and praises we humbly offer up to the throne of heaven
[798.38 → 801.80] in the words which Christ himself has taught us.
[802.34 → 803.08] The Lord's Prayer.
[803.30 → 804.20] Let's say this together.
[804.20 → 807.72] Our Father, who art in heaven,
[808.38 → 809.78] hallowed be thy name.
[810.42 → 811.52] Thy kingdom come,
[812.06 → 813.08] thy will be done,
[813.38 → 815.20] on earth as it is in heaven.
[815.74 → 818.10] Give us this day our daily bread,
[818.46 → 820.64] and forgive us our trespasses,
[821.14 → 824.34] as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[824.90 → 826.82] And lead us not into temptation,
[827.52 → 829.06] but deliver us from evil.
[829.06 → 831.08] For thine is the kingdom,
[831.68 → 832.32] and the power,
[832.74 → 833.36] and the glory,
[833.94 → 835.02] forever and ever.
[835.84 → 836.28] Amen.
[837.78 → 841.00] So as we celebrate our evening tonight,
[841.06 → 841.74] when we sing,
[841.94 → 843.56] I want to invite everyone to stand,
[844.32 → 845.62] and then afterward,
[845.96 → 846.80] when the song is done,
[846.86 → 847.40] you can sit,
[847.48 → 848.64] and we'll have scripture readings,
[848.90 → 850.44] and then when the next song comes up,
[850.50 → 850.88] just stand,
[850.96 → 851.68] and I'll just kind of,
[851.98 → 853.02] I'll let you do it on your own.
[853.02 → 856.46] So let's sing our first carol this evening,
[856.76 → 858.22] Angels from the Realms of Glory.
[858.30 → 859.14] Would you please stand,
[859.42 → 860.16] and let's sing together.

[1245.34 → 1247.34] Thank you.
[1269.34 → 1275.34] In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of
[1275.34 → 1277.34] the entire Roman world.
[1277.34 → 1283.34] This was the first census that took place while Comenius was governor of Syria.
[1283.34 → 1288.34] And everyone went to their own town to register.
[1288.34 → 1298.34] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[1298.34 → 1302.34] because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[1302.34 → 1311.34] He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[1311.34 → 1317.34] She lets's welcome again about Hamilton after the death of Joseph's meaning to get,
[1318.38 → 1322.34] and to the town and how he angled like this.
[1322.34 → 1325.34] She towards the faith as the porch, επ Sith as of The trophy as the museum.
[1325.34 → 1327.34] Claude Collect.
[1327.34 → 1328.34] An quality savings and and season.
[1328.34 → 1335.80] Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Joseph, a descendant of the famed ruler of Israel, King David.
[1336.98 → 1342.16] I lived in a time when the Jewish people greatly anticipated the promised Messiah.
[1343.50 → 1349.30] We were so tired of being oppressed by other nations, and this time it was the Romans.
[1349.92 → 1355.94] We were waiting for our Saviour to come, the one whom all the prophets had spoken about.
[1355.94 → 1363.58] I, too, waited with longing for this deliverer, but I also had other things on my mind.
[1364.62 → 1370.94] The most gracious and lovely young woman in the entire Roman world had become my betrothed.
[1371.30 → 1375.46] Her name, Mary, reflected her beauty of character.
[1376.76 → 1382.44] One day, shortly after we had pledged ourselves to each other in preparation for our marriage,
[1383.10 → 1385.20] Mary came to me in the middle of my workday.
[1385.94 → 1392.82] My heart first leapt, then sank, as she told me of a glorious visit she'd had from an angel
[1392.82 → 1397.20] who told her that Mary would become the mother of the Messiah.
[1398.20 → 1406.08] This would come by the power of the Holy Spirit, and now, as she came to me, Mary was already with child.
[1406.08 → 1407.08] What was I to think?
[1407.08 → 1413.52] I truly loved her, but how could I believe such a mystery?
[1414.56 → 1416.86] My soul wrestled day and night.
[1418.38 → 1423.26] Perhaps if I broke off our engagement quietly before it was made public.
[1423.26 → 1432.08] Then one night, after struggling in turmoil, I fell into a deep sleep, and I had a dream that changed everything.
[1433.12 → 1440.04] An angel told me not to be afraid to take Mary as my wife, that she would indeed bear the Messiah.
[1441.04 → 1442.04] I was awestruck.
[1442.04 → 1448.06] And not surprisingly, there were some whispers when Mary's pregnancy became obvious.
[1448.06 → 1452.08] And as the gossip spread, there were those who judged.
[1452.98 → 1459.62] But others entertained the possibility that the child might indeed be the coming Messiah.
[1459.62 → 1467.44] As for me, I was already beginning to love this new life growing before my very eyes.
[1468.78 → 1477.64] Mary was very near the end of her pregnancy when we were ordered by decree of the governor to register for the first census to avoid tax evasion.
[1478.84 → 1485.22] The trek from Nazareth to Bethlehem would be at least four days, even with a pack animal.
[1485.22 → 1492.62] Poor Mary, so heavy with child, the journey seemed endless during this last stage of pregnancy.
[1493.96 → 1498.18] Now she walked, and now she rode in grim silence.
[1498.76 → 1501.78] But I sensed how very uncomfortable she was.
[1502.86 → 1507.86] Then finally before us, we saw the sun beginning to set over Bethlehem.
[1515.22 → 1545.20] The sun beginning to set over Bethlehem.
[1545.22 → 1575.20] The sun beginning to set over Bethlehem.
[1575.20 → 1579.64] the blessings of his heaven.
[1579.64 → 1584.68] No ear may hear his coming,
[1585.06 → 1589.36] but in this world of sin,
[1589.92 → 1594.68] where meek souls will receive him still,
[1595.08 → 1598.84] the dear Christ enters thee.
[1598.84 → 1605.22] O holy child of Bethlehem,
[1605.60 → 1609.76] descend to us, we pray.
[1610.48 → 1615.28] Cast up our sin and enter thee,
[1615.66 → 1619.26] be born in us today.
[1620.48 → 1625.20] We hear the Christmas angels,
[1625.20 → 1629.94] the great glad tidings tell.
[1630.42 → 1635.48] O come to us, have thy request,
[1635.86 → 1639.52] the Lord Emmanuel.
[1639.52 → 1652.26] While they were there,
[1653.40 → 1655.80] the time came for the baby to be born,
[1656.36 → 1660.12] and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[1661.22 → 1665.54] She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger
[1665.54 → 1669.26] because there was no guest room available for them.
[1669.26 → 1691.40] Our little town of Bethlehem had never been so crowded.
[1692.48 → 1697.12] Every corner of the inn was full of guests already for days.
[1697.12 → 1700.92] I am Shiva, married to Baruch,
[1701.28 → 1706.52] and together we welcomed guests to our humble yet comfortable inn.
[1707.64 → 1710.76] I will always remember that night
[1710.76 → 1713.46] when the banging started on the door.
[1714.22 → 1715.56] We were already in bed,
[1716.14 → 1719.20] exhausted from a long and hard day's work.
[1720.66 → 1722.02] Baruch finally got up.
[1722.02 → 1728.80] At first, my tired, grumpy husband sent poor Mary and Joseph away.
[1729.62 → 1732.78] He always said that if someone wants a room in the inn,
[1733.30 → 1734.84] they should arrive on time.
[1736.18 → 1739.96] But when he came back to bed and told me
[1739.96 → 1743.64] that the woman was heavy with child,
[1744.30 → 1746.72] it was my turn to get grumpy.
[1746.72 → 1750.58] I took my husband by the sleeve
[1750.58 → 1754.62] and I dragged him back outside to look for the couple.
[1755.38 → 1759.68] We soon found them and took them into our cattle shed
[1759.68 → 1764.04] where we quickly made a bed ready for Mary.
[1765.16 → 1768.10] She was not long away from her delivery.
[1768.74 → 1769.46] Poor girl.
[1769.46 → 1773.08] Well, when we got Mary settled in,
[1773.26 → 1775.32] Baruch went back to the inn to bed,
[1775.40 → 1776.08] as man do,
[1776.62 → 1778.70] and I stayed with Mary and Joseph.
[1779.78 → 1782.98] And I listened to Mary's unbelievable story
[1782.98 → 1785.98] as she told it to me between her birth pains.
[1787.28 → 1788.24] She said,
[1788.44 → 1791.18] an angel told her that she would have a child
[1791.18 → 1794.74] by the Spirit of the Almighty One
[1794.74 → 1798.62] and that the child would be the Messiah.
[1799.76 → 1802.30] The Almighty's love was so great, she said,
[1802.52 → 1805.46] that he was coming into this world
[1805.46 → 1808.06] to walk with hurting people
[1808.06 → 1811.26] and to save the world.
[1812.30 → 1814.70] At first, I thought she was,
[1815.12 → 1816.22] what is your word?
[1816.96 → 1817.56] Delirious.
[1818.34 → 1820.98] Yes, women get that way in childbirth sometimes.
[1820.98 → 1825.90] So, but Mary, she said she believed the angel
[1825.90 → 1827.98] and she trusted the Almighty
[1827.98 → 1830.74] to take care of her and the child and Joseph.
[1831.84 → 1834.10] Well, maybe I would believe too
[1834.10 → 1835.92] if an angel came and visited me.
[1836.08 → 1836.62] Who knows?
[1838.18 → 1840.60] The baby was born in good time.
[1841.22 → 1844.68] Mary was tired, but relieved and joyful.
[1845.58 → 1848.34] I washed the child and gave him back to his mother.
[1848.34 → 1852.08] And together, we wrapped him in strips of cloth
[1852.08 → 1853.38] that I brought from the inn.
[1854.16 → 1857.74] It wasn't much, but it kept him snug and warm.
[1859.20 → 1861.04] After he had a bit of a feeding,
[1862.00 → 1864.50] Mary was tired and wanted to sleep.
[1865.16 → 1866.84] So I took the child from her
[1866.84 → 1869.24] and after a little bit of a cuddle,
[1869.66 → 1872.14] I laid him in the manger with hay.
[1873.50 → 1876.76] Mary said that his name would be Jesus.
[1876.76 → 1881.68] Many strange things happened that night
[1881.68 → 1883.40] and the days that followed.
[1884.02 → 1886.92] There were visitors, shepherds from a nearby field,
[1887.78 → 1891.38] rich, wise men from far away.
[1892.76 → 1896.12] There was talk of angels, of a star,
[1896.58 → 1900.42] and that this child would save us from the Romans.
[1900.42 → 1904.58] I wondered if there was anything else
[1904.58 → 1906.44] we might need saving from.
[1907.86 → 1911.12] Baruch too saw and heard all these things.
[1911.68 → 1914.80] He became certain that this child
[1914.80 → 1917.32] was the one the prophets of old had spoken of,
[1917.42 → 1918.10] the Messiah.
[1919.66 → 1923.16] My husband wept when he thought
[1923.16 → 1925.56] about sending Mary and Joseph away.
[1925.56 → 1928.04] At first, he was so sorry.
[1928.94 → 1930.66] We might never have met them
[1930.66 → 1933.22] or seen the Messiah, he cried.
[1933.62 → 1935.66] I should have given them our bed
[1935.66 → 1938.70] and we should have slept in the shed.
[1940.46 → 1943.08] Baruch became a different man.
[1943.76 → 1945.92] He welcomed people no matter what time
[1945.92 → 1947.42] of day or night they came to the inn.
[1947.60 → 1948.54] For he said,
[1948.54 → 1952.12] perhaps the Almighty has sent them to us.
[1953.28 → 1953.92] And to me,
[1954.56 → 1955.74] from then on,
[1956.10 → 1957.98] I would never have a day
[1957.98 → 1960.68] that I would not think about God's love
[1960.68 → 1962.18] so deep,
[1962.66 → 1963.86] so strong
[1963.86 → 1966.80] that he would come to the earth,
[1967.32 → 1970.12] to us as a child.
[1971.44 → 1973.18] What a mystery.
[1974.78 → 1976.18] What a mystery.
[1978.54 → 2008.52] What a mystery.
[2008.54 → 2013.02] What child is this
[2013.02 → 2016.04] too late to rest
[2016.04 → 2022.04] on Mary's lap is sleeping?
[2022.04 → 2026.68] Whom angels grieve
[2026.68 → 2029.54] with anthems speak
[2029.54 → 2033.68] while shepherds watch
[2033.68 → 2036.48] our King be?
[2036.48 → 2040.96] This, this is
[2040.96 → 2043.50] Christ the King
[2043.50 → 2046.22] O shepherds,
[2046.22 → 2050.70] God and angels sing
[2050.70 → 2053.04] Praise,
[2053.16 → 2055.90] praise to bring
[2055.90 → 2057.24] The King
[2057.24 → 2057.98] The King
[2057.98 → 2058.48] The King
[2058.48 → 2059.48] The King
[2059.48 → 2059.98] The King
[2059.98 → 2060.48] The King
[2060.48 → 2061.48] The King
[2061.48 → 2062.48] The King
[2062.48 → 2063.48] The King
[2063.48 → 2064.48] The King
[2064.48 → 2065.48] The King
[2065.48 → 2066.48] The King
[2066.48 → 2067.48] The King
[2067.48 → 2068.48] The King
[2068.48 → 2069.48] The King
[2069.48 → 2070.48] The King
[2070.48 → 2071.48] The King
[2071.48 → 2072.48] The King
[2072.48 → 2073.48] The King
[2073.48 → 2073.98] The King
[2073.98 → 2075.46] The King
[2075.48 → 2076.48] The King
[2076.48 → 2077.48] The King
[2077.48 → 2091.08] Good Christians, fearful sinners, dear, O silent world is bleeding.
[2092.68 → 2105.36] Lest fears shall pierce him through, The cross be born for me, for you.
[2105.36 → 2118.46] Hail, hail, the worm made flesh, The make of the Son of Mary.
[2118.46 → 2132.88] So bring him incense, gold and blue, A peasant king to all heal,
[2132.88 → 2146.88] The King of kings, salvation brings, Let loving hearts enthrone him.
[2147.94 → 2159.88] Raise, raise the song on high, The Virgin sings her lullaby.
[2159.88 → 2174.30] Joy, joy, for Christ is born, The babe, the Son of Mary.
[2174.30 → 2189.30] Do the falling, heart are breaking,
[2189.30 → 2206.30] How we need to hear from God.
[2206.30 → 2215.30] You've been promised, we've been waiting, Welcome, Holy Child.
[2215.30 → 2231.62] Hope that you don't mind our manger, How I wish we would have known.
[2231.62 → 2240.62] But long-awaited, holy stranger, Make yourself at home.
[2240.62 → 2245.62] Please make yourself at home.
[2245.62 → 2260.62] Bring your peace into our violence, Let our hungry souls be filled.
[2260.62 → 2267.62] We're now breaking, Heaven's silence, Welcome to our world.
[2267.62 → 2269.62] Welcome to our world.
[2269.62 → 2273.62] Welcome to our world.
[2273.62 → 2280.62] Welcome to our world.
[2280.62 → 2290.84] Crud your fingers sent to heal us, tender brow prepared for thorn.
[2290.84 → 2299.90] Tiny heart whose blood will save us, unto us is born.
[2300.64 → 2303.82] Unto us is born.
[2310.62 → 2320.30] So wrap our injured flesh around you, breathe our air and walk our side.
[2320.30 → 2329.24] Rob our sin and make us holy, perfect Son of God.
[2329.68 → 2338.34] Perfect Son of God, welcome to the world.
[2340.62 → 2362.94] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks
[2362.94 → 2363.62] at night.
[2363.62 → 2370.82] An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and
[2370.82 → 2372.22] they were terrified.
[2373.22 → 2376.84] But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid.
[2377.66 → 2382.94] I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[2384.34 → 2388.84] Today, in the town of David, a Saviour has been born to you.
[2388.84 → 2391.70] He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[2392.74 → 2394.46] This will be a sign to you.
[2395.28 → 2400.66] You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
[2402.28 → 2410.44] Suddenly, a great host of heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, Glory
[2410.44 → 2417.24] to God in the highest, in the highest heaven, and on earth, peace to those on whom his favour
[2417.24 → 2417.82] rests.
[2429.96 → 2430.56] Greetings.
[2431.02 → 2432.34] My name is Gabriel.
[2432.34 → 2432.42] Gabriel.
[2433.14 → 2438.60] I am a servant messenger for the Almighty God, an angel, a heavenly being.
[2439.44 → 2441.86] I have been to earth on many occasions.
[2442.44 → 2445.10] Some you may know about, and others you may not.
[2446.28 → 2449.86] I, and others like me, await the bidding of the Almighty.
[2451.06 → 2456.66] Because we stand in the presence of the holy God of heaven and earth, we bring heaven's light
[2456.66 → 2457.30] with us.
[2457.30 → 2463.42] Our brightness often frightens humans, for they are not accustomed to such light, and
[2463.42 → 2465.98] we are not accustomed to earth's sad darkness.
[2467.02 → 2473.00] When I was sent to the shepherds on the night of the Messiah's birth, I was honoured to herald
[2473.00 → 2473.56] that event.
[2474.70 → 2479.12] It was clear that the world was in deep darkness and in need of great saving.
[2479.72 → 2481.24] So much was going wrong.
[2481.88 → 2483.84] Families hurting and hating each other.
[2483.84 → 2488.62] Nations making war, poor people being left to suffer, and children ignored.
[2489.62 → 2492.12] Humans were paying no attention to their creator.
[2492.92 → 2495.54] Perhaps they thought they could manage just fine on their own.
[2496.22 → 2498.16] That did not seem to be working well.
[2499.04 → 2503.62] Now, at last, here is extraordinary news for ordinary people.
[2504.30 → 2507.34] I was not sent to King Herod or even the temple leaders.
[2507.34 → 2515.22] No, I was sent to Mary, a young, ordinary girl, and Joseph, an ordinary carpenter.
[2516.16 → 2520.66] I was sent to ordinary shepherds, but the message was extraordinary.
[2522.26 → 2525.44] Emmanuel, God with us, has come to earth.
[2526.12 → 2527.96] God himself became a baby.
[2528.48 → 2529.36] Imagine that.
[2529.36 → 2538.54] He would identify with ordinary people by being born in a stable instead of the palace he deserved.
[2539.48 → 2543.68] They would see that he understood what they were going through because he would experience
[2543.68 → 2544.70] their suffering too.
[2545.74 → 2551.22] People would see God as a person right beside them instead of imagining him far away.
[2552.10 → 2554.60] I was so excited to bring this news.
[2554.60 → 2559.14] It's like giving someone a very special gift that they had wanted more than anything.
[2560.52 → 2564.32] For that is what all humans want most, to be loved by their maker.
[2565.72 → 2572.30] Now, God's beloved people would have their wonderful counsellor, mighty God, everlasting father,
[2572.46 → 2576.34] and prince of peace all wrapped up in one tiny bundle.
[2577.00 → 2578.82] This truly is a mystery.
[2580.02 → 2583.10] When we got to the shepherds, they were lying half asleep.
[2583.10 → 2586.54] I suppose they were almost finished counting the sheep.
[2587.80 → 2591.24] The heavenly light we brought with us was a bit harsh for them.
[2591.86 → 2594.40] I think we scared the sandals right off their feet.
[2595.80 → 2598.32] The sheep, of course, didn't notice a thing.
[2598.80 → 2600.18] They're a little slow that way.
[2602.02 → 2604.24] I told the shepherds not to be afraid.
[2604.94 → 2607.90] I told them the good news of the child born in Bethlehem.
[2607.90 → 2611.84] I told them where to find him.
[2612.26 → 2614.00] They were still looking quite shocked.
[2614.56 → 2615.76] Other angels joined me.
[2616.18 → 2617.30] We didn't stay long.
[2617.94 → 2620.72] Just long enough to make sure they received this gift
[2620.72 → 2623.96] and long enough to burst into a song of praise to God.
[2624.78 → 2628.18] We left them gaping into the night, wondering what had just happened.
[2628.18 → 2631.76] They wouldn't be going back to sleep, that's for sure.
[2631.76 → 2638.16] I wish we could have stayed and travelled with them to Bethlehem,
[2638.30 → 2641.06] hovering along as they travelled and knelt before the child.
[2642.46 → 2647.32] It was marvellous to imagine the hope, joy, and peace the Messiah would bring
[2647.32 → 2650.18] and how it would change these ordinary shepherds
[2650.18 → 2653.96] into extraordinary witnesses of God's great saving love.
[2654.92 → 2658.88] The change had begun the very moment they heard and believed our message.
[2658.88 → 2686.88] O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
[2686.88 → 2695.88] O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
[2695.88 → 2705.26] Come and behold him, born the King of angels.
[2705.26 → 2714.26] O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him,
[2714.26 → 2724.00] O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
[2724.00 → 2727.00] Sing, all year-астly.
[2727.00 → 2742.96] Sing, all ye
[2742.96 → 2750.66] Glory to God, all glory in the highest.
[2750.66 → 2755.30] O come, let us adore him.
[2755.44 → 2759.78] O come, let us adore him.
[2759.78 → 2769.46] O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
[2769.46 → 2778.58] May God we greet thee on this happy morning.
[2779.36 → 2787.16] Jesus, to thee we all glory give.
[2788.16 → 2795.44] Word of the Father, now in flesh appear.
[2795.44 → 2800.94] O come, let us adore him.
[2800.94 → 2805.44] O come, let us adore him.
[2805.44 → 2810.44] O come, let us adore him.
[2810.44 → 2814.44] Praise the Lord.
[2814.44 → 2832.24] When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said one to another,
[2832.60 → 2838.90] Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[2838.90 → 2846.80] So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[2846.80 → 2854.40] When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.
[2854.40 → 2869.86] Shalom.
[2870.40 → 2871.38] I am Ezra.
[2871.86 → 2873.84] I was a shepherd in the field that night.
[2874.38 → 2875.02] That night.
[2876.90 → 2878.10] Here's how it happened.
[2878.10 → 2885.38] My uncle, my brother, Moshe, and a few of our cousins were tending the sheep.
[2885.38 → 2889.84] We were just about to drift off to sleep when there was a blinding light.
[2891.48 → 2893.28] Well, we think this is the end.
[2894.12 → 2895.16] We think we're dead men.
[2895.60 → 2899.82] We cover our faces with our hands and we shake so hard.
[2900.06 → 2901.52] I can feel my bones rattle.
[2902.06 → 2903.26] I can hear Moshe's too.
[2904.10 → 2906.26] Funny how the sheep just kept sleeping.
[2906.26 → 2913.42] Just when I think we're going to all melt away, I hear a voice that tells us not to be afraid.
[2914.42 → 2917.34] Then it says something about joyful news for us.
[2917.58 → 2919.98] For us, a bunch of raggedy sheep herders.
[2920.76 → 2923.12] And joy, every day is misery.
[2924.56 → 2927.14] All day and night we live with these smelly sheep.
[2927.88 → 2930.66] We sleep under the stars in all kinds of weather.
[2930.94 → 2935.50] We burn in the noontime heat, and we shiver in the freezing night.
[2936.26 → 2937.50] Then there's the Romans.
[2938.12 → 2939.80] They want everything we have.
[2940.12 → 2940.84] What's joy?
[2941.84 → 2946.38] But then the voice tells us there's a new baby who's come to save the world.
[2947.04 → 2951.46] That we will find him in Bethlehem, wrapped in cloth and lying in a manger.
[2952.42 → 2954.56] And slowly it starts to make sense.
[2954.56 → 2958.60] We've been waiting for over 400 years for the Messiah.
[2959.42 → 2961.88] The one who will free the innocent prisoners.
[2962.54 → 2966.36] The one that will make the blind see and the lame walk.
[2967.28 → 2972.46] While this is starting to sink in, all of a sudden there's a bunch of these angels.
[2972.84 → 2975.70] So many that there's no more room in the sky.
[2975.70 → 2978.90] And then they start to sing something beautiful.
[2979.40 → 2983.42] They sing glory to God and peace to all people on earth.
[2984.28 → 2985.88] Now I can hardly breathe.
[2986.36 → 2991.58] I close my eyes and I let the sound wrap me up in everything and in nothing.
[2992.66 → 2995.08] Well, as quick as they come, they're gone.
[2995.58 → 2996.48] Just like that.
[2997.04 → 2998.34] We stumble to our feet.
[2998.64 → 3001.18] We stare into the heavens with our mouths wide open.
[3001.18 → 3004.06] Everything is quiet, just like before.
[3004.62 → 3007.04] Only it's like a holy quiet, you know.
[3008.24 → 3011.76] Finally we pull ourselves together and start talking excited like,
[3011.98 → 3013.48] Did you see? Did you hear?
[3014.08 → 3016.88] Then Moshe says, Let's not stand here. Let's go.
[3017.62 → 3019.66] We can talk on the way. And we do.
[3021.28 → 3023.80] Everything the angel told us is exactly true.
[3024.42 → 3028.02] When we get to Bethlehem, we find an inn with the door still open,
[3028.24 → 3029.40] even though it's still dark.
[3029.40 → 3032.20] The innkeeper woman comes rushing out.
[3032.70 → 3034.30] And we tell her all about the angel.
[3034.84 → 3037.38] And she gets a smile that almost splits her face open.
[3038.32 → 3039.14] Come, she says.
[3039.42 → 3042.30] And inside the stable, we meet Joseph and Mary,
[3042.52 → 3045.18] who tell us that the baby's name is Jesus.
[3046.26 → 3048.78] And then, because we know this baby is the Saviour,
[3049.32 → 3050.52] who will change the world,
[3051.02 → 3053.40] we fall down on our knees in front of him.
[3054.30 → 3056.20] I think of what the angel told us.
[3056.20 → 3057.46] And my heart fills.
[3057.90 → 3059.50] I feel hope for my life,
[3059.94 → 3060.68] for my people,
[3061.08 → 3062.36] even for the whole world.
[3063.36 → 3065.58] And my heart wants to burst with joy
[3065.58 → 3067.04] when I look at this little baby,
[3067.40 → 3068.04] at Jesus.
[3068.58 → 3069.96] And then there's something else.
[3070.26 → 3070.90] There's peace,
[3071.06 → 3072.48] like I've never felt before.
[3072.48 → 3075.04] And I adore this little Saviour,
[3075.52 → 3076.36] this baby king.
[3076.88 → 3078.28] He seems so close to me.
[3078.86 → 3079.76] He's not rich.
[3080.94 → 3082.78] And he's in the shed with the animals.
[3083.42 → 3084.86] He doesn't even have a crib.
[3085.38 → 3087.30] I feel like he knows all about my life.
[3087.86 → 3089.44] I feel like he knows all about me.
[3089.86 → 3090.72] And I adore him.
[3090.72 → 3093.08] We don't stay long.
[3093.36 → 3094.64] We have to go back to the sheep.
[3095.50 → 3096.46] On our way back,
[3096.52 → 3097.32] we're so excited.
[3097.68 → 3099.62] We tell everyone we meet about Jesus.
[3100.82 → 3101.94] The Saviour has come.
[3102.54 → 3103.14] He is here.
[3103.46 → 3104.26] Don't wait for him.
[3104.98 → 3106.30] He will find you.
[3106.52 → 3107.60] He will change the world.
[3108.06 → 3109.34] He will change our lives.
[3110.86 → 3111.90] Praise be to God.
[3112.28 → 3113.36] Praise be to God.
[3113.36 → 3135.36] Angels we have heard on high,
[3135.68 → 3139.70] sweetly singing o'er the plains,
[3139.70 → 3143.70] and the mountains leading wide,
[3144.56 → 3148.54] echoing their joyous strains.
[3148.54 → 3161.46] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3161.46 → 3169.46] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3169.70 → 3176.04] In excels is Do.
[3177.20 → 3181.36] Shepherds, why this truly believe,
[3181.66 → 3185.10] why your joyous strains prolong,
[3186.04 → 3189.96] what the gladsome tidings be,
[3189.96 → 3194.52] which inspire your heavenly song.
[3194.52 → 3207.02] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3207.02 → 3207.52] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3207.52 → 3221.52] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3221.52 → 3223.52] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3223.52 → 3228.52] Gloria in excels is Do.
[3228.52 → 3232.10] whose birth the angels sing
[3232.10 → 3236.60] Commodore on brand-new knee
[3236.60 → 3241.00] Rise, O Lord, the newborn King
[3241.00 → 3249.28] Lord, Gloria
[3249.28 → 3254.18] In excels is Do
[3254.18 → 3262.98] Gloria
[3262.98 → 3269.72] In excels is Do
[3269.72 → 3283.74] And all who heard it,
[3284.18 → 3289.18] And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[3289.18 → 3294.86] But Mary treasured all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[3294.86 → 3305.54] I have been called blessed for centuries.
[3305.54 → 3316.22] The Blessed Virgin, the Blessed Mary, the Blessed Mother.
[3316.22 → 3324.22] But until that day, I was just an ordinary Hebrew girl with an ordinary life.
[3324.22 → 3326.22] Until that day.
[3326.22 → 3330.90] Now, nothing will ever be the same.
[3330.90 → 3334.90] Come, travel back with me in time.
[3334.90 → 3339.90] I am one morning, quietly stitching alone in my room, when an angel appears.
[3339.90 → 3346.90] I am frightened, for I have never seen such a glorious creature.
[3346.90 → 3351.58] But he tells me not to be afraid, that I am favoured by the Almighty.
[3351.58 → 3358.58] He tells me that I will become a mother through the Holy Spirit's power.
[3358.58 → 3363.26] I will bear the Messiah, the Son of God.
[3363.26 → 3369.44] After the angel disappears, I wonder, who am I to be so chosen?
[3369.44 → 3374.04] How is it the Almighty so favours me?
[3374.04 → 3378.74] As time goes by, I am grateful for signs along the way.
[3378.74 → 3386.18] To Elizabeth and Zachariah, to dear Joseph, to shepherds, and to wise men who warn us of
[3386.18 → 3389.86] King Herod's evil intent.
[3389.86 → 3397.70] Throughout this holy journey, these miraculous signs reassure me that Jesus, my Son, is indeed
[3397.70 → 3400.62] the Messiah.
[3400.62 → 3406.64] So when the shepherds come to kneel before the manger, thoughts swirl through my mind,
[3406.64 → 3414.08] as they tell their story of angels, fear and joy, glory and mystery.
[3414.08 → 3421.42] The Almighty's ways are truly mysterious, for he seems pleased to use very ordinary people
[3421.42 → 3424.44] to accomplish his purposes.
[3424.44 → 3426.24] How wonderful!
[3426.24 → 3430.76] He always brings what we need at exactly the right time.
[3430.76 → 3436.24] And always, everything comes about exactly as he has said.
[3436.24 → 3441.38] The shepherds are as amazed by this as am I.
[3441.38 → 3446.64] As I cuddle my newborn son, I wonder how he will affect us all.
[3446.64 → 3453.72] The shepherds, the people out in Bethlehem's streets tonight, the Hebrew nation, even the
[3453.72 → 3457.06] entire Roman world.
[3457.06 → 3462.68] And I can't help but wonder what will it be like to be his mother?
[3462.68 → 3469.18] I feel swept along by the mysterious plans of a holy God.
[3469.18 → 3476.14] But on this day of Jesus' birth, my heart overflows with unspeakable joy.
[3476.14 → 3480.62] As I snuggle him close, I love him so already.
[3480.62 → 3486.08] How can a heart contain such immeasurable love?
[3486.08 → 3488.44] But there is something else.
[3488.44 → 3492.40] A bittersweet lining envelops my heart.
[3492.40 → 3500.20] I feel a foreshadowing of great sorrow that my frail shoulders are unable to bear.
[3500.20 → 3503.64] Might I release this to the Almighty?
[3503.64 → 3506.70] Would he choose me, then leave me?
[3506.70 → 3509.04] Surely not.
[3509.04 → 3512.36] I will watch and wait for the promise to unfold.
[3512.36 → 3514.36] Through this beautiful babe.
[3514.36 → 3519.96] This gift to me and to Joseph and to the world.
[3519.96 → 3522.80] This gift bringing pure joy.
[3522.80 → 3528.82] This gift overcoming the sorrow that greets us all in this life.
[3528.82 → 3534.70] This gift that brings salvation from our sin and all that threatens to undo us.
[3534.70 → 3542.00] I gaze into my son's eyes, recalling the words of the prophet Isaiah.
[3542.00 → 3550.66] He will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[3550.66 → 3556.20] Yes, I have had much to ponder since the angels' visit.
[3556.20 → 3563.62] May my story help you ponder the great glory and mystery of the Saviour come to earth.
[3563.62 → 3564.62] God with us.
[3564.62 → 3575.04] Joy to the world, the Lord is God.
[3575.04 → 3581.04] Let earth receive her gift.
[3581.04 → 3588.98] Joy to the world, the Lord is God.
[3588.98 → 3595.40] Let earth receive her gift.
[3595.40 → 3603.50] Let every heart prepare Him room.
[3603.50 → 3606.90] Let heaven and nature sing.
[3606.90 → 3610.26] Let heaven and nature sing.
[3610.26 → 3617.50] Let heaven and heaven and nature sing.
[3617.50 → 3624.92] Joy to the earth, the Saviour who brings.
[3624.92 → 3631.92] Let all the storms employ.
[3631.92 → 3638.92] Both fields and floods, both fields and plains.
[3638.92 → 3646.34] Repeat the sound of the Lord.
[3646.34 → 3654.34] Repeat, repeat the sound in joy.
[3654.34 → 3655.72] All the storms, the Lord.
[3655.72 → 3661.76] Let the sun and sorrow grow.
[3661.76 → 3668.44] The thorns infest the ground.
[3668.44 → 3676.26] He comes to make His blessings flow.
[3676.26 → 3683.68] For as the curse is found.
[3683.68 → 3691.68] For as the curse is found.
[3691.68 → 3699.10] He rules the world with truth and grace.
[3699.10 → 3706.52] And makes all nations prove.
[3706.52 → 3713.94] The glories of His righteousness.
[3713.94 → 3717.40] And wonders of His love.
[3717.40 → 3721.04] And wonders of His love.
[3721.04 → 3728.94] And wonders, wonders of His love.
[3728.94 → 3733.44] All the same when we come to hell.
[3740.44 → 3743.22] Thank you for joining us this evening.
[3743.22 → 3747.56] And we have a Christmas Day worship service tomorrow morning at 1030,
[3747.56 → 3749.54] and everyone is welcome to join us.
[3749.54 → 3753.22] And our regular service on Sunday is also at 1030 in the morning.
[3754.60 → 3759.56] And before I give the benediction, and before we sing our final song, Silent Night,
[3760.02 → 3761.74] and even though this is a worship service,
[3762.26 → 3766.80] let's give a round of applause to our musician, our pianist, Marion,
[3767.04 → 3770.64] our singers, and our scripture reader, and all the narrators.
[3773.22 → 3782.70] And I know you just sat down, but would you please stand and remain standing
[3782.70 → 3785.76] for the benediction, and then we'll sing Silent Night together.
[3786.58 → 3789.48] Hear this good word, receive God's blessings over you.
[3790.22 → 3794.22] May the joy of the angels, the eagerness of the shepherds,
[3794.80 → 3799.92] the wonder of Mary, and the peace of the Christ child be yours this Christmas.
[3799.92 → 3804.54] The blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be upon you
[3804.54 → 3808.06] and remain with you forever. Amen.
[3808.06 → 3833.88] Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.
[3833.88 → 3841.70] Round yon virgin, mother and child,
[3841.70 → 3849.92] Holy infant so tender and mild,
[3849.92 → 3857.88] Sleep in heavenly peace,
[3857.88 → 3864.94] Sleep in heavenly peace,
[3864.94 → 3874.30] Silent night, holy night,
[3874.30 → 3882.22] Shepherds quake, loud and sigh,
[3882.22 → 3890.32] Glories stream from heaven afar.
[3890.32 → 3898.16] Heavenly hosts sing alleluia.
[3898.16 → 3904.26] Christ the Saviour is born,
[3904.26 → 3906.30] Christ the Saviour is born,
[3906.30 → 3912.90] Christ the Saviour is born,
[3912.90 → 3922.70] Silent night, holy night,
[3922.70 → 3927.02] Son of God,
[3927.02 → 3927.06] Son of God,
[3927.06 → 3930.84] Love's pure light,
[3930.84 → 3938.46] Glorious means from thy holy face,
[3938.46 → 3946.48] With the dawn of redeeming grace,
[3946.48 → 3952.58] Jesus, Lord of the Lord,
[3952.58 → 3956.48] Jesus, Lord of the Lord,
[3956.48 → 3961.02] Jesus, Lord of the Lord,
[3961.02 → 3962.78] come is be upon criers,
[3962.78 → 3967.36] Amen.
[3971.44 → 3973.36] Amen.
