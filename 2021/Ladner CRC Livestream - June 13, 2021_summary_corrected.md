• The journey begins with Psalm 121, which warns that trouble will arise as soon as one hits the road
• The speaker reflects on their own experience of using Psalm 121 for a sermon in Taiwan many years ago
• The main idea of Psalm 121 is that the road is filled with trouble, but God is a greater guardian who watches over us
• The speaker outlines three points to discuss: trouble, temptation, and trust
• The myth of a trouble-free Christian life
• The dangers on the road to discipleship mentioned in Psalm 121, including:
  • Slipping feet (verse 3)

• The reality of sin causing real-world consequences that can trip us up on the road
• The dangers of our own wayward hearts leading to sin
• The conspiracy against us from the world, flesh, and devil
• Uncertainty and instability of life
• Faced with problems, Christians may think God is punishing them or not present
• The psalm is a reminder that God loves and comforts us, and is always present
• Trouble and pain are part of the journey of faith, but what we do with it matters
• There's temptation on the road, and people turn to false sources for help (idols)
• The psalmist asks "where does my help come from?" and questions seeking help in idols
• The speaker discusses common temptations people turn to for help: magic, moralism, and mammon
• Magic is described as relying on knowledge or technique to solve problems, often hidden from non-enlightened individuals
• Moralism is believing that doing good will lead to a comfortable life, with God watching out for the individual
• Mammon is trusting in money for security and comfort
• The speaker argues these temptations are ultimately self-trust, which humans are not capable of fulfilling
• The psalmist in Psalm 121 looks to God as the source of help, rather than creation or human endeavours
• The Hebrew word "shaman" is used to describe God's role as a protector and guardian.
