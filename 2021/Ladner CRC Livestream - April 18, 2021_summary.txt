• The importance of taking on the title of Christian and exploring other titles that define what it means to be a Christian is emphasized
• The first title to be considered is "Disciple" from Mark 8:34-38

• The call to deny oneself and follow Jesus as the essence of discipleship
• The leader dictates what others must do
• Following the leader requires bravery and trust

• The call to discipleship begins with God's revelation of himself to us
• The nature of Jesus Christ as the son of God who died for humanity's sins

• The passage discusses the importance of not being ashamed of Jesus and his words.
• Following Christ requires surrendering to him and following his teachings wholeheartedly.
• Discipleship involves redefining one's relationships, values, and priorities in light of Jesus' lordship.
• The cost of following Christ is everything, including one's identity, purpose, and possessions.
• The story of the rich young ruler in Mark 10 serves as an example of the challenge of discipleship.
• A rich young ruler asks Jesus how to inherit eternal life
• Jesus lists the commandments, including honoring parents and not committing adultery or theft
• The ruler says he has kept these commands since childhood
• Jesus responds by stating that he loved the ruler, indicating a deeper understanding of true discipleship than just following rules
• Jesus' words are hard to hear for some people
• There's a willingness to speak difficult truth into people's lives out of love
• The rich young ruler was unable to accept Jesus' command to give up everything because he valued his wealth too much
• Picking up one's cross means dying to the lie of trying to be what God never intended, and coming alive to the reality of being restored back into fellowship with God.
• The speaker discusses a biblical story where Jesus encounters a young man who is attached to his wealth and possessions.
• Jesus doesn't negotiate with the young man or offer him a compromise, but instead loves him too much to allow him to maintain his attachment to material things.
• The speaker notes that this encounter is an example of how Jesus' message can be challenging for people who are deeply invested in worldly desires.
• The discussion then turns to the idea of denial and death in relation to following Christ, citing a quote from Bonhoeffer.
• The essence of being a disciple of Christ is having one's affections reshaped around the person of Jesus and putting total trust in him.
• Christ as the center of one's life
• Total trust in Jesus
• Contentment found in simple obedience to Jesus
• The importance of following Jesus' teachings, as stated in Mark 8:34
• Obedience being a fundamental aspect of discipleship and faith
• The need for simplicity and surrender in one's relationship with God

• Living a sacrificially generous life because Jesus is better
• Saying no to self-gratification for faithfulness to Jesus
• Valuing relationship with others over personal autonomy and freedom
