[240.00 --> 269.98]  Thank you.
[270.00 --> 299.98]  Thank you.
[299.98 --> 305.78]  Today is another special day because we are still in the church season of Easter and each
[305.78 --> 308.50]  week we have been celebrating a new life in Christ.
[308.62 --> 317.38]  We've been having a baptism and today is our last baptism for this season and so we will
[317.38 --> 319.32]  introduce you to the day we will introduce you to the day we will introduce you to Susan
[319.32 --> 324.38]  and we will show her video right before the baptism.
[324.38 --> 334.62]  Also, happy Mother's Day to all of the moms and so I hope you can not only say happy Mother's
[334.62 --> 340.16]  Day to your own mother and those mothers in your life today but also it's a good time to
[340.16 --> 348.10]  just call the day we will say we will say we will say we will say we will say we will say we will
[348.10 --> 352.02]  and so I hope we can still kind of feel connected as the body of Christ as we reach out to one
[352.02 --> 352.68]  another.
[352.68 --> 358.84]  And so our designated offering for today is for world renew and especially on this Mother's
[358.84 --> 364.78]  Day they have a ministry called maternal and child health.
[364.78 --> 371.74]  And so our designated offering is for world renews maternal and child health programs which
[371.74 --> 378.60]  seeks to support mothers and children where they have great need and lack around the world.
[380.14 --> 387.08]  So with those few announcements let's prepare our hearts to come to the Lord in worship and
[387.08 --> 388.90]  adoration this morning.
[388.90 --> 394.06]  So God calls us to worship him with these words from the Psalms.
[394.14 --> 398.44]  We'll have the words on the screen for you and where it says all I invite you to participate
[398.44 --> 400.62]  and to say it out loud.
[402.62 --> 405.96]  The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[406.84 --> 407.82]  Whom shall I fear?
[408.86 --> 411.50]  The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
[412.02 --> 413.58]  Of whom shall I be afraid?
[413.58 --> 421.44]  One thing have I asked of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house
[421.44 --> 424.36]  of the Lord all the days of my life.
[425.50 --> 429.50]  I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy.
[430.44 --> 433.30]  I will sing and make melody to the Lord.
[434.44 --> 441.26]  The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[441.26 --> 449.06]  That's a good reminder to us this morning that God is gracious, he is abounding in love and
[449.06 --> 451.60]  he loves us and he calls us to worship him.
[451.98 --> 457.00]  So let's come before him in our hearts and together in spirit, in prayer and adoration
[457.00 --> 457.40]  to him.
[457.56 --> 458.30]  Would you pray with me?
[460.56 --> 465.04]  Our Heavenly Father we thank you for this Sunday, this first day of the week.
[465.94 --> 468.22]  Every Sunday is like a mini Easter.
[468.22 --> 474.20]  Father, it's a time that we can celebrate the life that we have in you because you and
[474.20 --> 480.70]  your steadfast love have set your love upon us even when we didn't deserve it and you have
[480.70 --> 482.94]  made us your sons and daughters.
[484.16 --> 490.40]  Father, we praise you for who you are, the holy, the merciful, the just, the righteous God
[490.40 --> 491.74]  of all of the universe.
[491.74 --> 497.88]  So this morning, Father, we pray that you would gather up the praises of your people and that
[497.88 --> 506.12]  you would turn our hearts toward you and praise to hear your word to us to respond to you in
[506.12 --> 506.60]  our lives.
[507.00 --> 508.00]  We pray in Jesus' name.

[774.94 --> 781.06]  Born of his spirit, washed in his blood
[781.06 --> 804.98]  This is my song, Ray, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
[804.98 --> 819.42]  Perfect submission, perfect delight, visions of rapture, no burst at my sight.
[819.42 --> 830.78]  Angels descending, ringing for fire, echoes of mercy, was my son, I.
[830.78 --> 841.78]  This is my song, Ray, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
[841.78 --> 853.78]  This is my story, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
[853.78 --> 863.58]  Perfect submission, all is a rest.
[863.58 --> 874.58]  I am my Savior, I am blessed, Watching and waiting, looking above,
[875.78 --> 880.76]  Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
[880.76 --> 892.76]  This is my song, Ray, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
[892.76 --> 903.76]  This is my song, Ray, this is my song, Praising my Savior all the day long.
[903.76 --> 907.76]  Filled with His goodness, Lord, and waiting, looking above,
[907.76 --> 909.72]  Filled with His goodness, Lord, and waiting, looking above,
[910.76 --> 920.32]  Filled with His goodness, How many of His goodness
[932.32 --> 934.26]  today is my death.
[934.92 --> 938.66]  Filled with Shaien, The Passover with His goodness.
[938.66 --> 949.90]  The feeling of worship is in needful.
[949.90 --> 956.32]  I have always taken out by divorce,
[956.32 --> 968.50]  Even using theche passed by겠�inden mechanizers.
[968.50 --> 980.50]  within 133 months, the highest triumph of the children of Jewish Schoolaltres.
[980.50 --> 1010.48]  Thank you.
[1010.50 --> 1040.48]  Thank you.
[1040.50 --> 1070.48]  Thank you.
[1070.50 --> 1100.48]  Thank you.
[1100.50 --> 1130.48]  Thank you.
[1130.48 --> 1132.48]  Thank you.
[1160.48 --> 1162.78]  And so I'll say a few words of introduction.
[1162.78 --> 1167.96]  So again, brothers and sisters, hear these words from the Apostle Paul.
[1167.96 --> 1173.78]  All of us who are baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death.
[1173.78 --> 1186.36]  We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may rise or may live a new life.
[1186.36 --> 1194.30]  And so baptism is a sign and seal of God's promises to us, his covenant people.
[1194.30 --> 1209.42]  In baptism, God promises by grace alone to forgive our sins, to adopt us into the body of Christ, the church, to send the Holy Spirit daily to renew and cleanse us and to resurrect us to eternal life.
[1209.42 --> 1214.42]  And this promise is made visible in the waters of baptism.
[1214.42 --> 1218.10]  And so water, it cleanses us, right, and purifies us.
[1218.10 --> 1223.10]  When we're thirsty or not, it cleanses us.
[1223.10 --> 1228.02]  And Jesus came and he said, I am the living water.
[1228.02 --> 1236.56]  And so Susan, you have come today to profess your faith and receive the sacrament of baptism.
[1237.20 --> 1241.58]  Susan has been going through the baptism classes with Nancy.
[1242.62 --> 1247.68]  I think the first time she came to our church was on Christmas Eve in 2019.
[1248.30 --> 1250.76]  And she actually came and we had, this was before COVID.
[1250.76 --> 1260.36]  But she's been going through the classes and she was interviewed by Joe and myself and shared her story with us.
[1260.36 --> 1263.68]  And we were very encouraged by what God is doing in her life.
[1263.96 --> 1278.76]  And she, as she told us in her video, she is ready to take this step of faith, to put her trust in Jesus Christ and to receive his forgiveness and his help to walk along this path of life with the Lord's help.
[1278.76 --> 1284.54]  So Susan, I will ask you now before God.
[1284.66 --> 1285.52]  So these are vows.
[1285.74 --> 1294.04]  So we, before God, who is looking upon us, before this church, not just the few of us here, but all of us watching.
[1295.46 --> 1298.02]  I ask you to profess your faith in Jesus Christ.
[1299.56 --> 1304.58]  So do you renounce sin and the power of evil in your life and in the world?
[1305.12 --> 1306.74]  Yes, I renounce them.
[1306.74 --> 1307.22]  Okay.
[1307.50 --> 1309.28]  And who is your Lord and Savior?
[1310.04 --> 1312.14]  Jesus is my Lord and Savior.
[1312.24 --> 1312.50]  Okay.
[1312.92 --> 1315.28]  And will you be a faithful member of this congregation?
[1315.98 --> 1322.20]  And through worshiping and serving, seek to advance God's kingdom here in this church and throughout the world?
[1322.94 --> 1324.32]  Yes, God help me.
[1324.76 --> 1325.58]  Okay, thank you.
[1325.58 --> 1330.54]  So let's pray for God's help and presence with us now.
[1330.64 --> 1331.26]  Let's pray together.
[1331.26 --> 1340.96]  Father, we thank you, Father, that by the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus, who is the living water, that he forgives us by his grace.
[1341.64 --> 1349.20]  He frees us from our slavery to sin and death, and he opens up the way to life eternal.
[1349.20 --> 1353.24]  Father, we thank you for this beautiful gift of baptism.
[1353.24 --> 1367.54]  And in this water, you confirm to us that we are united to you in your life and your death and your resurrection, that we belong to you, that we are being renewed by the Spirit.
[1367.54 --> 1371.66]  So, Father, we pray that you would pour out your Holy Spirit upon Susan.
[1373.14 --> 1387.92]  Lord, would you indwell her with your Spirit so that she may know your presence with her, that she may know your power to live for you, and that she may experience being a daughter of the King.
[1388.70 --> 1390.76]  We pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[1391.42 --> 1391.76]  Amen.
[1391.76 --> 1391.88]  Amen.
[1393.26 --> 1393.72]  Okay.
[1395.28 --> 1395.60]  So.
[1397.54 --> 1399.70]  There we go.
[1404.70 --> 1409.32]  Susan, Jesus chose you before the foundation of the world.
[1410.06 --> 1412.74]  He sent Jesus into this world for you.
[1413.70 --> 1416.46]  Jesus lived for you, and he died for you.
[1417.20 --> 1418.34]  He rose again for you.
[1418.40 --> 1424.88]  He ascended into heaven for you, and one day he will return for you to bring you back into his eternal kingdom.
[1424.88 --> 1435.78]  So, Susan, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1437.24 --> 1437.66]  Amen.
[1438.66 --> 1439.96]  You may stand.
[1439.96 --> 1450.92]  So, now the declaration.
[1450.92 --> 1460.22]  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the only king and the head of the church, Susan is now received into the visible membership of the church.
[1461.00 --> 1466.02]  She has been sealed by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ's own forever.
[1466.02 --> 1466.46]  Amen.
[1466.82 --> 1467.26]  Amen.
[1467.80 --> 1468.58]  So, let me pray.
[1469.06 --> 1473.94]  Father, we pray for your blessing upon Susan and her daughter, Charlotte.
[1474.54 --> 1482.90]  Lord, we pray that you would continue to work in the lives of this family, and especially, Lord, and Susan now on this day of her baptism.
[1483.90 --> 1486.92]  Lord, would you continue to conform her into the image of Christ?
[1486.92 --> 1489.32]  Would you help her to grow in faith?
[1490.20 --> 1491.64]  Would she come to know you?
[1492.20 --> 1499.00]  Would she become a mature child of God who is able to serve others and lead others to know you as well?
[1499.84 --> 1504.72]  Lord, we pray for your mercy and your grace in Susan's life and in Charlotte's life.
[1505.24 --> 1507.32]  We pray in your holy name.
[1507.90 --> 1508.12]  Amen.
[1508.50 --> 1508.76]  Amen.
[1509.80 --> 1510.02]  Okay.
[1513.30 --> 1515.48]  Oh, I have your gifts.
[1515.48 --> 1516.20]  Susan.
[1517.10 --> 1517.52]  Here.
[1518.32 --> 1519.24]  Oh, thank you.
[1519.26 --> 1519.80]  It's a certificate.
[1520.28 --> 1521.00]  Here's a Bible.
[1521.00 --> 1521.52]  Here.
[1521.52 --> 1527.22]  Oh, yeah.
[1527.22 --> 1528.20]  Oh, yeah.
[1529.22 --> 1529.90]  Oh, my.
[1530.16 --> 1530.56]  Oh, yeah.
[1530.94 --> 1532.36]  Oh, yeah.
[1532.36 --> 1532.58]  Oh, yeah.
[1535.20 --> 1536.38]  Oh, yeah.
[1536.44 --> 1537.50]  I'm of love.
[1537.56 --> 1538.24]  So, yeah.
[1538.24 --> 1544.82]  We won't feel the battle, we won't feel the night
[1544.82 --> 1550.12]  We will walk the valley with you by our side
[1550.12 --> 1555.24]  You will go before us, you will lead the way
[1555.24 --> 1561.04]  We have found a refuge, only you can save
[1561.04 --> 1567.16]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1567.16 --> 1571.80]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1571.80 --> 1576.82]  Where's your voice now? No love is greater
[1576.82 --> 1582.72]  One can sit against us if our God is for us
[1582.72 --> 1591.68]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall
[1591.68 --> 1596.76]  Even when I turn back, still your love is sure
[1596.76 --> 1601.40]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake
[1601.40 --> 1607.42]  You will cheer me on with the devil and in grace
[1607.42 --> 1613.40]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1613.40 --> 1618.04]  Live for us, our Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1618.04 --> 1623.06]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater
[1623.06 --> 1629.00]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1629.00 --> 1643.66]  Neither heart nor death can separate us
[1643.66 --> 1648.64]  Hell and death will not defeat us
[1648.64 --> 1657.30]  He who gave his Son to free us
[1657.30 --> 1662.30]  He who gave his Son to free us
[1662.30 --> 1663.30]  Hold me in his love
[1663.30 --> 1667.30]  He who gave his Son to free us
[1667.30 --> 1670.30]  He who gave his Son to free us
[1670.30 --> 1680.96]  Hold me in his arms
[1680.96 --> 1687.30]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us
[1687.30 --> 1691.94]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
[1691.94 --> 1696.86]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater
[1696.86 --> 1702.96]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1702.96 --> 1720.62]  Come now to this time of confession
[1720.62 --> 1723.38]  And to hear God's words of assurance
[1723.38 --> 1726.88]  And the Christian life is a life of repentance and faith
[1726.88 --> 1729.00]  It's to acknowledge that we still are sinners
[1729.00 --> 1732.82]  And it's to confess that before God
[1732.82 --> 1734.96]  But then to look to Jesus Christ
[1734.96 --> 1737.06]  In his grace for us
[1737.06 --> 1738.24]  Which he freely gives
[1738.24 --> 1742.36]  So let me read this prayer of confession
[1742.36 --> 1743.80]  Would you join me in your hearts?
[1745.56 --> 1747.34]  O Lord, great God
[1747.34 --> 1749.08]  Father most gracious
[1749.08 --> 1751.62]  Filled with mercy and steadfast love
[1751.62 --> 1754.32]  We are embarrassed to come before you
[1754.32 --> 1758.00]  For we have preferred the ways of this world to your ways
[1758.00 --> 1760.90]  For we have rebelled against your wisdom
[1760.90 --> 1762.88]  We have gotten into trouble
[1762.88 --> 1766.20]  For we have rejected your fatherly guidance
[1766.20 --> 1768.50]  And have gotten lost altogether
[1768.50 --> 1771.36]  Forgive us in your great mercy
[1771.36 --> 1774.30]  In the gift of your Son, Jesus Christ
[1774.30 --> 1784.08]  And hear these words of grace
[1784.08 --> 1790.60]  Therefore, since we have been justified through faith
[1790.60 --> 1793.22]  We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1793.22 --> 1796.56]  Through whom we have gained access by faith
[1796.56 --> 1799.44]  Into this grace in which we now stand
[1799.44 --> 1802.58]  And we boast in the hope of the glory of God
[1802.58 --> 1806.00]  Brothers and sisters, may the peace of Christ be with you
[1806.00 --> 1808.06]  And also with you
[1808.06 --> 1810.04]  Let's continue to sing
[1810.04 --> 1811.44]  And to rejoice
[1811.44 --> 1813.14]  In the grace that we have received
[1813.14 --> 1830.24]  Men of sorrows, Lamb of God
[1830.24 --> 1834.28]  Men of sorrows, Lamb of God
[1834.28 --> 1838.54]  By his own betray
[1838.54 --> 1851.58]  The sin of men and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.
[1851.58 --> 1866.58]  Silent as he stood and kissed, beaten, mocked, and scorned,
[1866.58 --> 1877.58]  bowing to the Father's will, he took a crown of foes.
[1877.58 --> 1889.58]  O God, my good cross, my salvation, may your love pour now over me.
[1889.58 --> 1901.58]  God, my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[1901.58 --> 1915.58]  The sin of heaven, God's own son, to purchase and redeem.
[1915.58 --> 1927.58]  The lack of salvation, may your love pour now over me.
[1927.58 --> 1939.58]  O God, my good cross, my salvation, may your love pour now over me.
[1939.58 --> 1951.58]  Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[1951.58 --> 1960.58]  Now my death is pain, it is painful.
[1960.58 --> 1966.58]  Now my precious blood, that my Jesus spilled.
[1966.58 --> 1972.58]  Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.
[1972.58 --> 1978.58]  Now the Son is free, oh, is free indeed.
[1978.58 --> 1984.58]  Now my death is pain, it is pain, it is pain, it is pain, it is pain.
[1984.58 --> 1990.58]  Now my precious blood, that my Jesus spilled.
[1990.58 --> 1996.58]  Now their voice of sin has no hold on me.
[1996.58 --> 2002.58]  Now the Son stands free, oh, is free indeed.
[2002.58 --> 2014.58]  Now their blood, that my grace, my salvation, may your love pour now over me.
[2014.58 --> 2025.58]  Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[2026.58 --> 2035.58]  Now my grace, see the stone is washed away.
[2035.58 --> 2041.58]  Behold the empty tomb.
[2041.58 --> 2052.58]  Hallelujah, God be praised, His will as a prophet will be.
[2052.58 --> 2058.26]  All upon you cross my salvation
[2058.26 --> 2064.04]  We are high for the whole of me
[2064.04 --> 2069.22]  Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah
[2069.22 --> 2075.76]  Praise and honor unto me
[2075.76 --> 2082.14]  Praise and honor unto me
[2082.58 --> 2084.58]  Amen
[2084.58 --> 2096.54]  Okay, welcome again.
[2097.98 --> 2104.22]  And so, during the season of Easter, we have been in a sermon series called You Are.
[2104.22 --> 2110.32]  This is kind of the counterpart to the series we did before, which was I Am, where Jesus said,
[2110.32 --> 2119.04]  the seven I Am statements that revealed who He was as the Christ, who is God Himself.
[2119.82 --> 2124.70]  And now, in this season of Easter, we are exploring the series You Are, which is to say,
[2124.70 --> 2129.94]  because Christ has risen from the dead, He has sent the Spirit into our hearts.
[2130.18 --> 2131.34]  Who does that make us?
[2131.36 --> 2138.70]  What are some of the titles that we receive, that we see in the New Testament, that tell us who we are in Jesus Christ?
[2138.70 --> 2146.60]  And so, today, you know, we have looked at, over the last few weeks, we have seen that we are disciples,
[2147.32 --> 2149.56]  that we are witnesses.
[2150.52 --> 2152.58]  Last week, we saw how we are servants,
[2153.12 --> 2158.70]  and today, the title that we are going to consider together is the title of children.
[2159.50 --> 2161.24]  You are a child of God.
[2161.24 --> 2164.72]  So, we will look today at Galatians,
[2165.18 --> 2169.92]  and we will have the scriptures up here on the screen.
[2170.00 --> 2172.22]  Galatians 4, we'll read verses 1 through 7.
[2174.38 --> 2176.36]  What I am saying is that,
[2176.96 --> 2180.66]  as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave.
[2181.50 --> 2183.38]  Although he owns the whole estate,
[2184.22 --> 2188.94]  the heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
[2188.94 --> 2192.08]  So, also, when we were underage,
[2192.42 --> 2193.30]  we were in slavery,
[2193.90 --> 2197.02]  under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.
[2197.92 --> 2199.70]  But when the time set,
[2200.48 --> 2201.26]  the set time,
[2201.64 --> 2202.58]  had fully come,
[2203.32 --> 2204.34]  God sent his son,
[2205.04 --> 2205.86]  born of a woman,
[2206.52 --> 2207.64]  born under the law,
[2207.96 --> 2209.56]  to redeem those under the law,
[2210.06 --> 2213.16]  that we might receive adoption to sonship.
[2213.60 --> 2214.94]  Because you are sons,
[2215.10 --> 2217.94]  God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
[2217.94 --> 2220.00]  the Spirit who calls out,
[2220.52 --> 2221.52]  Abba, Father.
[2222.86 --> 2224.60]  So, you are no longer a slave,
[2225.00 --> 2225.90]  but God's child.
[2226.52 --> 2227.90]  And since you are his child,
[2228.06 --> 2230.74]  God has made you also an heir.
[2233.18 --> 2233.74]  Amen.
[2233.90 --> 2235.56]  This is the word of the Lord,
[2235.88 --> 2238.42]  and God gives it to us because he loves us.
[2239.48 --> 2243.50]  So, I don't know how many of you have read C.S. Lewis'
[2244.12 --> 2246.44]  The Narnia series,
[2246.44 --> 2249.36]  but one of the books in the series is called
[2249.36 --> 2251.00]  The Horse and His Boy.
[2251.70 --> 2252.44]  And in the story,
[2252.54 --> 2254.78]  there's a young boy named Shasta.
[2255.56 --> 2259.00]  And the story begins with young Shasta being at his home
[2259.00 --> 2262.34]  in what he thinks is his father's house.
[2263.72 --> 2266.86]  But Shasta's father is a rough man
[2266.86 --> 2269.82]  who doesn't look after him very well,
[2269.94 --> 2271.44]  who makes him work very hard,
[2271.44 --> 2274.98]  who doesn't speak kindly to Shasta.
[2275.64 --> 2276.38]  And one day,
[2276.46 --> 2278.30]  they have a visitor at their home,
[2278.48 --> 2280.96]  and Shasta's father sends Shasta out,
[2281.36 --> 2282.50]  outside,
[2283.02 --> 2284.64]  while he talks with his visitor.
[2285.22 --> 2287.40]  And Shasta listens in.
[2287.56 --> 2289.18]  He wants to hear the conversation.
[2290.26 --> 2293.36]  And what he hears shocks him.
[2293.92 --> 2295.20]  Because what he discovers
[2295.20 --> 2298.70]  is that he is not actually the son of this man
[2298.70 --> 2300.92]  who he thought was his father.
[2301.48 --> 2304.14]  But this man had found him
[2304.14 --> 2305.48]  and imprisoned him
[2305.48 --> 2308.72]  and is actually treating him like a slave.
[2309.30 --> 2311.30]  And this man he thought was his father
[2311.30 --> 2314.62]  is now negotiating to sell Shasta
[2314.62 --> 2316.04]  to somebody else.
[2317.12 --> 2318.98]  Well, as Shasta hears this,
[2319.04 --> 2321.68]  he realizes that he needs to get away.
[2322.38 --> 2323.40]  He needs to escape.
[2323.40 --> 2325.02]  And in that moment,
[2325.74 --> 2327.02]  the visitor's horse,
[2327.22 --> 2328.44]  and the horse's name is Bree,
[2329.08 --> 2330.30]  begins talking to him.
[2330.92 --> 2331.16]  Right?
[2331.24 --> 2332.70]  He's a talking horse from Narnia.
[2332.80 --> 2334.12]  That's a whole other part of the story.
[2334.66 --> 2336.76]  But they decide to escape together,
[2337.10 --> 2338.64]  and so much of the story
[2338.64 --> 2340.08]  is about their adventure
[2340.08 --> 2342.92]  as they head toward Narnia.
[2343.86 --> 2345.44]  So now along the way,
[2345.78 --> 2347.80]  Shasta comes upon a young boy
[2347.80 --> 2349.46]  who is a prince,
[2349.90 --> 2352.92]  who looks remarkably like him.
[2353.86 --> 2357.20]  And who happens to be the son of King Loon.
[2357.86 --> 2359.08]  And as the story progresses,
[2359.26 --> 2360.34]  we find out that Shasta
[2360.34 --> 2362.10]  is actually the twin brother
[2362.10 --> 2363.80]  of this prince.
[2364.28 --> 2366.30]  And that he himself, Shasta,
[2366.54 --> 2369.00]  is the long-lost son
[2369.00 --> 2371.74]  of King Loon himself.
[2372.90 --> 2374.10]  And so part of the story then
[2374.10 --> 2375.26]  is about this recovery
[2375.26 --> 2376.94]  of Shasta's true identity
[2376.94 --> 2381.32]  as a free-born son of the king.
[2382.32 --> 2382.52]  Right?
[2382.58 --> 2385.22]  What an amazing change of fortunes
[2385.22 --> 2386.32]  for Shasta.
[2386.82 --> 2386.96]  Right?
[2387.04 --> 2389.18]  One day he's the sad slave
[2389.18 --> 2390.50]  of a rough man
[2390.50 --> 2392.96]  who has him enslaved,
[2392.96 --> 2394.42]  and the next day he discovers
[2394.42 --> 2395.94]  that he is actually somebody else.
[2396.26 --> 2398.34]  That there's this entire new life,
[2398.58 --> 2399.62]  this new identity
[2399.62 --> 2401.42]  that is waiting him
[2401.42 --> 2404.12]  as a child of the king.
[2404.12 --> 2406.92]  So now Paul,
[2407.08 --> 2408.94]  in our passage today in Galatians,
[2408.98 --> 2410.72]  is using a similar kind of analogy.
[2411.60 --> 2412.72]  And Paul is saying to us
[2412.72 --> 2413.82]  that like Shasta,
[2414.44 --> 2415.94]  who you really are
[2415.94 --> 2417.64]  is a child of the king.
[2418.34 --> 2420.40]  You are a son
[2420.40 --> 2421.66]  or a daughter
[2421.66 --> 2423.64]  of God Almighty,
[2424.14 --> 2426.04]  the king of the entire universe.
[2426.60 --> 2428.44]  That God is your good
[2428.44 --> 2429.94]  and loving and true father.
[2429.94 --> 2432.52]  Now J.I. Packer,
[2432.58 --> 2433.80]  who is an amazing theologian
[2433.80 --> 2434.22]  and scholar
[2434.22 --> 2435.78]  who passed away just recently,
[2436.40 --> 2437.38]  had this to say
[2437.38 --> 2439.16]  about the Christian's identity
[2439.16 --> 2440.38]  as a child of God.
[2440.68 --> 2441.28]  He says this,
[2441.30 --> 2441.96]  I'm going to put the quote
[2441.96 --> 2442.98]  on the screen for us.
[2442.98 --> 2444.38]  He said,
[2444.44 --> 2445.56]  If you want to judge
[2445.56 --> 2446.84]  how well a person
[2446.84 --> 2448.06]  understands Christianity,
[2448.74 --> 2450.30]  find out how much
[2450.30 --> 2451.48]  he makes of the thought
[2451.48 --> 2453.04]  of being God's child
[2453.04 --> 2454.32]  and having God
[2454.32 --> 2455.32]  as his father.
[2456.08 --> 2457.30]  If this is not the thought
[2457.30 --> 2458.58]  that prompts and controls
[2458.58 --> 2459.82]  his worship and praise
[2459.82 --> 2461.64]  and his whole outlook on life,
[2462.08 --> 2463.54]  it means he does not understand
[2463.54 --> 2464.26]  Christianity
[2464.26 --> 2465.64]  very well at all.
[2466.68 --> 2469.44]  Adoption is the highest privilege
[2469.44 --> 2471.60]  the gospel offers.
[2471.60 --> 2475.78]  I think it's an amazing quote.
[2477.84 --> 2479.92]  And so in our sermon today,
[2479.92 --> 2481.66]  we are going to explore
[2481.66 --> 2483.28]  our certainty,
[2484.30 --> 2486.80]  the certainty of our sonship.
[2487.50 --> 2488.84]  And this word sonship
[2488.84 --> 2489.90]  is a theological term
[2489.90 --> 2491.30]  that really refers to
[2491.30 --> 2492.82]  both men and women,
[2492.98 --> 2493.64]  sons and daughters,
[2493.74 --> 2494.86]  because in that day,
[2495.24 --> 2497.48]  the son was the heir.
[2498.54 --> 2500.82]  But now, with Jesus,
[2500.82 --> 2503.66]  who is the great liberator,
[2503.88 --> 2505.96]  he makes men and women
[2505.96 --> 2507.70]  equally can be sons of God.
[2507.76 --> 2510.50]  We can equally be heirs of God.
[2510.56 --> 2512.04]  And so we use this term sonship.
[2512.08 --> 2514.94]  But it refers to sons and daughters.
[2515.10 --> 2517.04]  It means that we all can be heirs
[2517.04 --> 2518.60]  and children of the Heavenly Father.
[2519.18 --> 2520.36]  So we're going to see first
[2520.36 --> 2521.56]  how Paul describes
[2521.56 --> 2523.40]  our predicament of slaves,
[2524.06 --> 2525.08]  and then secondly,
[2525.22 --> 2526.50]  how God makes us his children.
[2527.22 --> 2527.34]  Right?
[2527.34 --> 2528.50]  So there's this clear movement
[2528.50 --> 2529.24]  in this passage
[2529.24 --> 2531.26]  from slaves to sons,
[2531.32 --> 2532.70]  just like in the story of Shasta,
[2532.90 --> 2534.34]  where he was a slave,
[2534.96 --> 2537.12]  but he became a son of the king.
[2537.18 --> 2539.12]  And that's our story as well.
[2539.50 --> 2540.96]  So let's look at these verses together.
[2541.40 --> 2542.62]  And the first main point
[2542.62 --> 2545.04]  is from slaves.
[2546.34 --> 2547.38]  So we first,
[2547.52 --> 2548.66]  and that's how Paul begins
[2548.66 --> 2550.08]  in verses one through three.
[2550.20 --> 2551.64]  So we will look at those verses now.
[2552.86 --> 2553.68]  Paul says again,
[2553.80 --> 2555.60]  what I am saying is that
[2555.60 --> 2557.96]  as long as an heir is under age,
[2558.00 --> 2559.28]  he is no different from a slave.
[2559.74 --> 2561.32]  Although he owns the whole estate,
[2562.04 --> 2563.46]  the heir is subject to guardians
[2563.46 --> 2564.90]  and trustees until the time
[2564.90 --> 2565.68]  set by his father.
[2565.92 --> 2566.56]  So also,
[2566.74 --> 2567.76]  when we were under age,
[2568.04 --> 2569.02]  we were in slavery
[2569.02 --> 2571.98]  under the elemental spiritual forces
[2571.98 --> 2572.56]  of the world.
[2573.18 --> 2573.32]  Okay?
[2573.36 --> 2574.40]  So in verses one through three,
[2575.00 --> 2575.82]  Paul argues that
[2575.82 --> 2576.92]  whether someone is born
[2576.92 --> 2578.08]  as a son of a slave
[2578.08 --> 2579.76]  or as the son
[2579.76 --> 2581.16]  of a wealthy landowner,
[2581.64 --> 2582.26]  in a sense,
[2582.36 --> 2583.18]  that their childhood
[2583.18 --> 2585.04]  may look quite similar.
[2585.82 --> 2587.06]  Because even the son,
[2587.14 --> 2588.10]  who is the heir
[2588.10 --> 2589.08]  of a great estate,
[2589.68 --> 2591.26]  is still going to be
[2591.26 --> 2592.32]  under guardians
[2592.32 --> 2593.36]  and caretakers
[2593.36 --> 2595.48]  until he comes of age.
[2596.44 --> 2597.32]  And it reminds me
[2597.32 --> 2598.14]  of the Lion King.
[2598.26 --> 2599.26]  I don't know if you've seen
[2599.26 --> 2600.90]  the Disney animated film
[2600.90 --> 2601.52]  The Lion King.
[2601.68 --> 2602.44]  There's this bird
[2602.44 --> 2603.40]  named Zazu
[2603.40 --> 2605.08]  who is entrusted
[2605.08 --> 2606.30]  to look after
[2606.30 --> 2607.62]  young Simba.
[2607.62 --> 2608.10]  Right?
[2608.30 --> 2609.86]  And Simba is the son
[2609.86 --> 2611.84]  of the Lion King.
[2612.48 --> 2613.66]  And one of the first songs
[2613.66 --> 2614.16]  in the movie
[2614.16 --> 2615.44]  is where Simba sings,
[2615.98 --> 2617.18]  I just can't wait
[2617.18 --> 2617.86]  to be king.
[2618.38 --> 2618.86]  Right?
[2618.92 --> 2620.18]  So there's this back and forth
[2620.18 --> 2621.80]  between Simba
[2621.80 --> 2623.40]  who wants to be king now
[2623.40 --> 2625.68]  and Zazu who says,
[2625.94 --> 2626.18]  no,
[2626.40 --> 2627.58]  it is not time yet.
[2628.18 --> 2628.54]  Now,
[2628.72 --> 2629.60]  not yet.
[2629.78 --> 2629.96]  Now,
[2630.04 --> 2630.38]  not yet.
[2631.08 --> 2632.04]  And in many ways,
[2632.74 --> 2634.00]  Simba feels like a slave.
[2634.16 --> 2635.08]  And that is just what Paul
[2635.08 --> 2635.92]  is talking about here.
[2635.92 --> 2637.48]  But then one day,
[2637.60 --> 2638.44]  the day will come
[2638.44 --> 2639.52]  when the guardian's role
[2639.52 --> 2640.22]  is over
[2640.22 --> 2641.62]  and this young child
[2641.62 --> 2642.88]  will move into the fullness
[2642.88 --> 2645.62]  of his planned life
[2645.62 --> 2648.22]  as an heir
[2648.22 --> 2649.32]  and with the inheritance.
[2650.60 --> 2652.52]  Paul says in verses 1-3
[2652.52 --> 2655.56]  that every single one of us
[2655.56 --> 2657.00]  as men and women
[2657.00 --> 2657.52]  and children
[2657.52 --> 2659.56]  are like those
[2659.56 --> 2660.86]  who are under guardians
[2660.86 --> 2662.42]  and that this is,
[2662.60 --> 2662.88]  in fact,
[2662.96 --> 2663.96]  a kind of slavery.
[2665.06 --> 2665.68]  And he says,
[2665.86 --> 2666.40]  this is the case
[2666.40 --> 2667.20]  both for Jews
[2667.20 --> 2668.06]  and Gentiles.
[2668.14 --> 2668.92]  So let's look at that.
[2669.00 --> 2669.66]  For the Jews,
[2670.14 --> 2670.84]  their guardian
[2670.84 --> 2672.74]  would be the Mosaic Law
[2672.74 --> 2673.78]  and the Old Covenant.
[2674.46 --> 2675.46]  The law was given
[2675.46 --> 2677.08]  to teach God's people
[2677.08 --> 2678.82]  how they should live
[2678.82 --> 2680.36]  under God's good rule.
[2681.62 --> 2683.44]  But they weren't able
[2683.44 --> 2684.72]  to keep the law perfectly.
[2684.92 --> 2685.72]  So what God did
[2685.72 --> 2686.40]  was he provided
[2686.40 --> 2687.56]  the sacrificial system
[2687.56 --> 2688.78]  as a means for forgiveness.
[2688.78 --> 2690.42]  So he gave the law
[2690.42 --> 2692.38]  to shepherd his people,
[2692.46 --> 2693.14]  to teach them,
[2693.32 --> 2694.16]  to lead them
[2694.16 --> 2694.70]  to the then,
[2694.78 --> 2696.00]  the coming promise
[2696.00 --> 2697.90]  of salvation
[2697.90 --> 2698.98]  that would come through Christ.
[2699.74 --> 2701.30]  So the law, Paul says,
[2701.38 --> 2701.96]  was intended
[2701.96 --> 2704.20]  to show us our sin,
[2704.54 --> 2705.74]  to show us our inability
[2705.74 --> 2706.82]  to keep the law,
[2707.06 --> 2708.28]  and then to drive us
[2708.28 --> 2709.08]  to God
[2709.08 --> 2710.24]  to receive the promise
[2710.24 --> 2710.92]  of salvation
[2710.92 --> 2711.70]  through faith,
[2711.78 --> 2712.44]  by grace.
[2713.70 --> 2715.70]  So that our promised inheritance
[2715.70 --> 2717.18]  as being the children of God
[2717.18 --> 2718.42]  would come through Jesus Christ.
[2719.26 --> 2720.36]  But instead of the law
[2720.36 --> 2721.08]  being our guardian
[2721.08 --> 2722.16]  to lead us to Christ,
[2722.54 --> 2723.38]  what we did was
[2723.38 --> 2724.12]  we took the law
[2724.12 --> 2725.12]  and we twisted it
[2725.12 --> 2726.68]  as a way that we can have
[2726.68 --> 2727.44]  our own righteousness
[2727.44 --> 2729.32]  and to justify ourselves
[2729.32 --> 2731.28]  by trying to keep the law.
[2731.80 --> 2732.78]  So God's people began
[2732.78 --> 2733.88]  to think that God's promise
[2733.88 --> 2734.66]  of salvation
[2734.66 --> 2736.72]  in our inheritance
[2736.72 --> 2738.44]  as children of God
[2738.44 --> 2740.12]  actually came by keeping the law,
[2740.18 --> 2741.28]  but that was never the intention.
[2742.76 --> 2743.08]  And now,
[2743.28 --> 2745.36]  perhaps some of us today
[2745.36 --> 2746.80]  may have grown up
[2746.80 --> 2747.76]  viewing God this way.
[2747.76 --> 2748.58]  Maybe we have,
[2749.04 --> 2749.26]  kind of,
[2749.30 --> 2750.00]  we see God
[2750.00 --> 2751.16]  as a distant deity
[2751.16 --> 2752.90]  that we have to please
[2752.90 --> 2754.34]  by our own works.
[2755.58 --> 2756.14]  But friends,
[2756.24 --> 2757.48]  if we try to do that,
[2757.54 --> 2758.44]  if we try to
[2758.44 --> 2760.46]  create our own righteousness
[2760.46 --> 2763.76]  by following God's moral law,
[2764.18 --> 2765.52]  by doing what He thinks
[2765.52 --> 2767.08]  He commands us to do,
[2767.14 --> 2768.02]  by living for Him,
[2768.30 --> 2769.10]  we try to seek
[2769.10 --> 2769.76]  our own righteousness
[2769.76 --> 2770.50]  in that way,
[2770.56 --> 2771.28]  what happens is
[2771.28 --> 2772.42]  we live like slaves.
[2772.42 --> 2774.06]  You see,
[2774.16 --> 2775.52]  God doesn't own you
[2775.52 --> 2776.56]  like a slave.
[2777.22 --> 2778.00]  He loves you
[2778.00 --> 2778.64]  like a child.
[2779.48 --> 2780.42]  He doesn't need
[2780.42 --> 2781.60]  our obedience.
[2782.24 --> 2783.30]  He actually doesn't need
[2783.30 --> 2784.26]  our performance
[2784.26 --> 2785.54]  for us to be valuable
[2785.54 --> 2786.30]  to Him
[2786.30 --> 2788.16]  because we are
[2788.16 --> 2789.82]  His beloved children.
[2790.24 --> 2790.96]  He knows
[2790.96 --> 2792.30]  we're going to mess up.
[2792.36 --> 2792.48]  You know,
[2792.48 --> 2793.18]  just like a parent,
[2793.28 --> 2794.14]  we tell our children
[2794.14 --> 2795.00]  the right way,
[2795.08 --> 2795.88]  we try to give them
[2795.88 --> 2796.34]  instruction,
[2796.34 --> 2798.16]  but,
[2798.40 --> 2799.72]  well,
[2799.80 --> 2800.22]  sometimes,
[2800.32 --> 2801.20]  because we're bad parents,
[2801.30 --> 2802.68]  we expect our children
[2802.68 --> 2804.18]  to obey
[2804.18 --> 2805.16]  and if they don't,
[2805.20 --> 2806.80]  then maybe we do actually,
[2807.34 --> 2807.92]  you know,
[2808.12 --> 2808.88]  our relationship
[2808.88 --> 2809.84]  is kind of damaged
[2809.84 --> 2810.40]  in that way.
[2810.54 --> 2811.72]  But it's not that way
[2811.72 --> 2812.30]  for God.
[2812.52 --> 2813.50]  We have been trained
[2813.50 --> 2814.04]  that way.
[2814.48 --> 2815.48]  Maybe we were parented
[2815.48 --> 2815.78]  that way.
[2815.88 --> 2816.64]  Maybe we sometimes
[2816.64 --> 2817.46]  parent our own children
[2817.46 --> 2817.86]  that way.
[2818.32 --> 2819.30]  But in fact,
[2819.98 --> 2820.66]  the inheritance
[2820.66 --> 2821.72]  that we receive
[2821.72 --> 2822.66]  is a gift
[2822.66 --> 2824.32]  to sons and daughters.
[2824.44 --> 2825.58]  It can never be earned
[2825.58 --> 2826.48]  by slaves.
[2827.90 --> 2829.10]  And so we can stop
[2829.10 --> 2830.12]  living our lives
[2830.12 --> 2831.86]  as if we can earn
[2831.86 --> 2832.62]  God's favor
[2832.62 --> 2834.10]  as slaves.
[2835.54 --> 2835.98]  Instead,
[2836.26 --> 2836.80]  what we can do
[2836.80 --> 2837.84]  is we turn to Jesus
[2837.84 --> 2838.94]  and we say,
[2839.22 --> 2839.82]  by faith,
[2840.08 --> 2840.30]  Jesus,
[2840.46 --> 2841.26]  I look to you.
[2841.34 --> 2842.38]  You are my heavenly Father
[2842.38 --> 2843.60]  and I receive
[2843.60 --> 2844.44]  this inheritance
[2844.44 --> 2846.42]  and it is mine.
[2846.68 --> 2847.18]  There's nothing
[2847.18 --> 2848.20]  I could do
[2848.20 --> 2849.50]  to deserve it.
[2849.58 --> 2849.86]  There's nothing
[2849.86 --> 2850.58]  I could have done.
[2850.64 --> 2850.94]  There's nothing
[2850.94 --> 2851.92]  I can do
[2851.92 --> 2852.90]  to achieve it.
[2853.76 --> 2854.80]  So that's kind of
[2854.80 --> 2855.36]  the situation
[2855.36 --> 2856.06]  for Jews
[2856.06 --> 2856.76]  and sometimes
[2856.76 --> 2857.94]  in the church today
[2857.94 --> 2859.74]  we live in the same way
[2859.74 --> 2861.44]  where we try to seek
[2861.44 --> 2862.42]  our own righteousness
[2862.42 --> 2863.80]  and that just,
[2864.48 --> 2865.96]  we lose the gospel,
[2866.16 --> 2867.20]  we go off the rails,
[2867.40 --> 2868.72]  we become self-righteous
[2868.72 --> 2870.14]  and it's an ugly picture.
[2870.56 --> 2871.68]  But we're not slaves,
[2871.76 --> 2872.36]  we're children.
[2873.28 --> 2874.58]  Now for the Gentiles,
[2875.02 --> 2876.82]  they were enslaved
[2876.82 --> 2878.48]  under their own
[2878.48 --> 2879.40]  pagan religions.
[2880.30 --> 2881.64]  This is what Paul means
[2881.64 --> 2882.24]  in verse 3
[2882.24 --> 2882.94]  where he says,
[2882.94 --> 2883.76]  he talks about
[2883.76 --> 2884.58]  these elemental
[2884.58 --> 2885.78]  spiritual forces
[2885.78 --> 2886.64]  of the world.
[2887.78 --> 2889.08]  So these elemental
[2889.08 --> 2889.68]  spirits
[2889.68 --> 2891.18]  are belief systems
[2891.18 --> 2892.08]  that we have,
[2892.26 --> 2893.48]  that we hold onto
[2893.48 --> 2894.74]  and that we believe
[2894.74 --> 2896.62]  as ways for us
[2896.62 --> 2898.42]  to find ourselves,
[2898.78 --> 2900.72]  to save ourselves,
[2901.04 --> 2902.42]  to find the good life.
[2903.48 --> 2903.68]  Right?
[2903.74 --> 2904.48]  And this is,
[2904.54 --> 2904.86]  you know,
[2904.90 --> 2905.70]  what we see in the world
[2905.70 --> 2906.36]  around us.
[2906.90 --> 2907.22]  You know,
[2907.36 --> 2908.42]  most of us
[2908.42 --> 2909.04]  are not Jews
[2909.04 --> 2910.10]  but we are still
[2910.10 --> 2911.62]  enslaved to these
[2911.62 --> 2912.36]  other beliefs
[2912.36 --> 2913.40]  and ideologies
[2913.40 --> 2915.14]  that are not God's
[2915.14 --> 2917.40]  plan for human beings.
[2917.78 --> 2918.60]  But we use these
[2918.60 --> 2919.48]  other beliefs
[2919.48 --> 2921.26]  to try to
[2921.26 --> 2922.72]  find life,
[2922.82 --> 2923.50]  to try to create
[2923.50 --> 2924.44]  life for ourselves.
[2925.60 --> 2926.32]  And Paul says
[2926.32 --> 2927.36]  that you are enslaved
[2927.36 --> 2928.32]  to these things.
[2929.46 --> 2930.52]  So that is the situation
[2930.52 --> 2931.24]  that we all
[2931.24 --> 2932.18]  find ourselves in.
[2932.30 --> 2933.20]  Outside of belonging
[2933.20 --> 2933.84]  to Christ,
[2933.98 --> 2934.86]  the whole world
[2934.86 --> 2935.68]  is enslaved.
[2936.36 --> 2937.10]  But Paul is going
[2937.10 --> 2938.00]  to take the rest
[2938.00 --> 2938.62]  of this passage
[2938.62 --> 2939.32]  now to talk
[2939.32 --> 2940.02]  about how
[2940.02 --> 2941.34]  those of us
[2941.34 --> 2942.50]  who are in Christ
[2942.50 --> 2943.50]  have moved
[2943.50 --> 2944.34]  from this position
[2944.34 --> 2945.40]  of being slaves
[2945.40 --> 2947.44]  either to the law
[2947.44 --> 2947.88]  of Moses
[2947.88 --> 2948.78]  or to pagan
[2948.78 --> 2949.80]  religious beliefs
[2949.80 --> 2951.24]  and have now
[2951.24 --> 2952.80]  become full
[2952.80 --> 2953.52]  sons of God
[2953.52 --> 2953.94]  himself.
[2955.04 --> 2955.26]  Okay?
[2955.30 --> 2955.62]  So we are going
[2955.62 --> 2955.94]  to move from
[2955.94 --> 2956.90]  slaves to sons
[2956.90 --> 2958.14]  and that is where
[2958.14 --> 2958.98]  Paul moves to.
[2959.10 --> 2959.46]  So we are going
[2959.46 --> 2960.24]  to look now
[2960.24 --> 2961.26]  at verses 4-7
[2961.26 --> 2962.74]  and see how
[2962.74 --> 2963.86]  God has made
[2963.86 --> 2965.04]  us sons
[2965.04 --> 2965.90]  of God.
[2965.90 --> 2967.14]  And we are going
[2967.14 --> 2967.74]  to see that
[2967.74 --> 2968.50]  our status
[2968.50 --> 2969.20]  as children
[2969.20 --> 2970.58]  is a work
[2970.58 --> 2971.92]  of the triune
[2971.92 --> 2972.26]  God.
[2972.36 --> 2973.46]  It is really cool
[2973.46 --> 2974.08]  and I hope
[2974.08 --> 2974.52]  we can see
[2974.52 --> 2975.00]  this together.
[2975.46 --> 2976.24]  That this is
[2976.24 --> 2976.98]  the plan,
[2977.42 --> 2978.02]  the deliberate
[2978.02 --> 2979.18]  intentional plan
[2979.18 --> 2979.86]  of the Father.
[2980.76 --> 2981.60]  That it is then
[2981.60 --> 2982.80]  secured
[2982.80 --> 2984.46]  by the work
[2984.46 --> 2985.86]  of redemption
[2985.86 --> 2986.88]  in Jesus.
[2987.70 --> 2988.54]  And that it is
[2988.54 --> 2989.46]  then experienced
[2989.46 --> 2990.44]  by the indwelling
[2990.44 --> 2991.64]  of the Holy Spirit.
[2992.36 --> 2992.52]  Okay?
[2992.80 --> 2993.30]  So we are going
[2993.30 --> 2993.50]  to look at
[2993.50 --> 2994.24]  those three things.
[2994.34 --> 2995.06]  So first,
[2995.06 --> 2996.28]  the plan
[2996.28 --> 2997.28]  of the Father.
[2997.42 --> 2998.10]  So let's read
[2998.10 --> 2999.34]  verses 4-5.
[3000.90 --> 3001.84]  But when the set
[3001.84 --> 3002.84]  time has fully
[3002.84 --> 3003.32]  come,
[3003.78 --> 3004.62]  God sent his
[3004.62 --> 3004.90]  son,
[3005.02 --> 3005.70]  born of a woman,
[3005.84 --> 3006.52]  born under the
[3006.52 --> 3006.78]  law,
[3007.08 --> 3007.64]  to redeem
[3007.64 --> 3008.30]  those under the
[3008.30 --> 3008.90]  law that we
[3008.90 --> 3009.52]  might receive
[3009.52 --> 3010.28]  adoption to
[3010.28 --> 3010.76]  sonship.
[3011.60 --> 3012.08]  Okay, so now
[3012.08 --> 3013.20]  let's have a look
[3013.20 --> 3014.62]  at three of the
[3014.62 --> 3015.58]  clauses here.
[3016.38 --> 3017.60]  First, Paul says,
[3017.74 --> 3018.54]  when the set
[3018.54 --> 3020.16]  time had fully
[3020.16 --> 3020.60]  come.
[3020.90 --> 3021.52]  And what this
[3021.52 --> 3022.20]  phrase means is
[3022.20 --> 3022.86]  that God
[3022.86 --> 3024.58]  planned out
[3024.58 --> 3025.48]  the time.
[3026.14 --> 3026.86]  Okay, God the
[3026.86 --> 3028.08]  Father had an
[3028.08 --> 3029.48]  intentional plan.
[3029.64 --> 3030.30]  God is not
[3030.30 --> 3030.94]  winging it.
[3031.02 --> 3031.70]  He's not making
[3031.70 --> 3032.46]  stuff up as he
[3032.46 --> 3033.06]  goes along.
[3033.20 --> 3034.18]  But God looked
[3034.18 --> 3035.08]  over all of
[3035.08 --> 3035.94]  redemptive history,
[3036.42 --> 3037.48]  this whole timeline
[3037.48 --> 3038.30]  that God was
[3038.30 --> 3039.00]  working with,
[3039.26 --> 3040.48]  and just at the
[3040.48 --> 3041.44]  right time,
[3041.76 --> 3042.58]  God sent
[3042.58 --> 3043.40]  Jesus.
[3044.52 --> 3045.40]  So there was a
[3045.40 --> 3046.52]  plan before him.
[3046.98 --> 3047.18]  Right?
[3047.24 --> 3048.12]  Remember, God
[3048.12 --> 3049.14]  gave the law
[3049.14 --> 3050.38]  that came as a
[3050.38 --> 3051.28]  guardian to lead
[3051.28 --> 3051.98]  us to Christ,
[3052.16 --> 3052.82]  and then at the
[3052.82 --> 3053.58]  right time,
[3054.02 --> 3055.00]  God sent Jesus.
[3055.86 --> 3056.38]  And so then
[3056.38 --> 3057.16]  when Jesus came
[3057.16 --> 3057.72]  in Mark,
[3057.98 --> 3058.44]  chapter 1,
[3058.48 --> 3059.64]  verse 15,
[3060.72 --> 3061.54]  we see Jesus
[3061.54 --> 3062.46]  arrives on the
[3062.46 --> 3063.16]  scene and he
[3063.16 --> 3063.62]  says,
[3064.50 --> 3065.06]  the time has
[3065.06 --> 3065.40]  come.
[3065.52 --> 3065.88]  That's what he
[3065.88 --> 3066.14]  says.
[3066.20 --> 3066.74]  The time has
[3066.74 --> 3067.06]  come.
[3067.40 --> 3067.82]  The kingdom
[3067.82 --> 3068.82]  of God is
[3068.82 --> 3070.38]  now near.
[3070.78 --> 3071.60]  The plan is
[3071.60 --> 3072.64]  being unfolded.
[3072.64 --> 3073.28]  The plan of
[3073.28 --> 3073.70]  the Father.
[3075.74 --> 3076.38]  So secondly,
[3076.54 --> 3077.20]  we see that
[3077.20 --> 3078.22]  when the set
[3078.22 --> 3079.08]  time had fully
[3079.08 --> 3079.84]  come,
[3080.30 --> 3080.82]  God sent
[3080.82 --> 3081.26]  his son.
[3081.86 --> 3082.50]  And when Paul
[3082.50 --> 3083.02]  says God
[3083.02 --> 3083.76]  sent his son,
[3083.82 --> 3084.36]  it's not that
[3084.36 --> 3085.56]  God was ordering
[3085.56 --> 3086.38]  his son around.
[3086.46 --> 3086.94]  It's not like,
[3087.14 --> 3088.16]  son, go,
[3088.72 --> 3088.98]  you know,
[3089.02 --> 3089.42]  and the son
[3089.42 --> 3090.40]  has to obey.
[3090.82 --> 3091.42]  That's not the
[3091.42 --> 3091.98]  case because
[3091.98 --> 3093.14]  Jesus is equal
[3093.14 --> 3094.00]  with God,
[3094.50 --> 3095.32]  and Jesus was
[3095.32 --> 3096.64]  fully committed
[3096.64 --> 3098.20]  to this plan.
[3099.84 --> 3100.48]  And this is
[3100.48 --> 3101.58]  what theologians
[3101.58 --> 3102.54]  call the covenant
[3102.54 --> 3103.24]  of redemption.
[3103.44 --> 3104.12]  That's a theological
[3104.12 --> 3105.02]  term I want you
[3105.02 --> 3106.00]  to take into
[3106.00 --> 3106.74]  your vocabulary.
[3107.10 --> 3107.62]  The covenant
[3107.62 --> 3108.38]  of redemption.
[3109.08 --> 3110.20]  Which is this,
[3110.26 --> 3110.70]  that before
[3110.70 --> 3111.52]  time,
[3111.98 --> 3112.24]  God,
[3112.32 --> 3112.74]  the triune
[3112.74 --> 3113.00]  God,
[3113.10 --> 3113.34]  Father,
[3113.52 --> 3113.78]  Son,
[3113.82 --> 3114.18]  and Holy
[3114.18 --> 3114.52]  Spirit
[3114.52 --> 3115.48]  entered into
[3115.48 --> 3116.24]  an agreement
[3116.24 --> 3117.40]  together
[3117.40 --> 3118.38]  where,
[3118.88 --> 3119.42]  knowing what
[3119.42 --> 3119.96]  was going to
[3119.96 --> 3121.00]  happen in
[3121.00 --> 3121.54]  the world,
[3121.94 --> 3122.74]  they pledged
[3122.74 --> 3123.40]  to redeem
[3123.40 --> 3123.94]  the world
[3123.94 --> 3124.72]  through the
[3124.72 --> 3125.22]  work of
[3125.22 --> 3125.64]  the Son.
[3126.50 --> 3127.04]  And Scripture
[3127.04 --> 3128.06]  itself speaks
[3128.06 --> 3128.60]  to this.
[3128.72 --> 3129.32]  Ephesians chapter
[3129.32 --> 3130.00]  1 talks about
[3130.00 --> 3130.56]  how God
[3130.56 --> 3132.02]  chose us in
[3132.02 --> 3132.78]  Christ before
[3132.78 --> 3133.36]  the creation
[3133.36 --> 3134.02]  of the world
[3134.02 --> 3135.42]  for adoption
[3135.42 --> 3136.22]  to sonship.
[3136.38 --> 3136.66]  That's what
[3136.66 --> 3137.08]  it says.
[3138.46 --> 3139.06]  And so,
[3139.14 --> 3140.16]  we see here
[3140.16 --> 3140.92]  this amazing
[3140.92 --> 3142.58]  intent and
[3142.58 --> 3144.10]  deliberate plan
[3144.10 --> 3145.00]  of God
[3145.00 --> 3146.04]  to make a
[3146.04 --> 3146.66]  people for
[3146.66 --> 3147.54]  himself who
[3147.54 --> 3148.26]  would then be
[3148.26 --> 3149.24]  his children.
[3150.30 --> 3150.42]  Right?
[3150.48 --> 3150.78]  And so,
[3150.92 --> 3151.40]  that means
[3151.40 --> 3153.16]  God's redemption
[3153.16 --> 3155.12]  of you is not
[3155.12 --> 3155.72]  arbitrary.
[3156.78 --> 3157.06]  Right?
[3157.46 --> 3158.92]  God didn't just,
[3159.14 --> 3159.36]  like,
[3160.26 --> 3161.14]  you happen to
[3161.14 --> 3161.92]  have found your way
[3161.92 --> 3162.62]  into this family
[3162.62 --> 3163.16]  and God's like,
[3163.24 --> 3163.36]  oh,
[3163.42 --> 3163.96]  there you are,
[3164.06 --> 3165.22]  I'm so surprised,
[3165.32 --> 3165.50]  you know,
[3165.66 --> 3166.34]  and you are not
[3166.34 --> 3168.16]  plan C or D
[3168.16 --> 3169.40]  or J or anything,
[3169.62 --> 3170.30]  but that God
[3170.30 --> 3171.54]  himself planned
[3171.54 --> 3172.36]  all along that
[3172.36 --> 3173.62]  you would be
[3173.62 --> 3174.52]  his child.
[3176.30 --> 3176.96]  Then the third
[3176.96 --> 3177.72]  phrase we see
[3177.72 --> 3178.50]  in God's plan
[3178.50 --> 3179.50]  is in verse 5,
[3179.90 --> 3180.46]  that we might
[3180.46 --> 3181.22]  receive adoption
[3181.22 --> 3181.90]  as sonship.
[3182.62 --> 3183.34]  The purpose
[3183.34 --> 3184.18]  of Christ's coming,
[3184.80 --> 3185.96]  the reason God
[3185.96 --> 3186.72]  sent his son
[3186.72 --> 3187.34]  into the world
[3187.34 --> 3188.00]  is so that you
[3188.00 --> 3188.90]  and I might
[3188.90 --> 3189.68]  be adopted
[3189.68 --> 3191.62]  as God's children.
[3191.62 --> 3193.42]  And the fact
[3193.42 --> 3194.20]  that Paul uses
[3194.20 --> 3194.80]  this language
[3194.80 --> 3195.52]  of adoption
[3195.52 --> 3196.48]  shows us
[3196.48 --> 3197.22]  something of
[3197.22 --> 3197.90]  God's plan
[3197.90 --> 3198.36]  as well.
[3200.58 --> 3200.86]  You know,
[3200.98 --> 3201.36]  I don't know,
[3201.46 --> 3201.98]  do you know
[3201.98 --> 3202.94]  anybody who has
[3202.94 --> 3203.60]  tried to adopt
[3203.60 --> 3204.04]  a child
[3204.04 --> 3204.64]  or have you
[3204.64 --> 3205.44]  adopted a child?
[3205.90 --> 3206.58]  Do you know
[3206.58 --> 3207.46]  how intentional
[3207.46 --> 3208.44]  adoption is?
[3209.26 --> 3209.46]  Right?
[3209.82 --> 3210.18]  So,
[3210.64 --> 3210.86]  you know,
[3210.90 --> 3211.52]  on the one hand,
[3211.58 --> 3212.40]  it is possible
[3212.40 --> 3213.54]  for some people
[3213.54 --> 3214.18]  to have
[3214.18 --> 3215.46]  unplanned
[3215.46 --> 3216.38]  pregnancies.
[3217.30 --> 3217.82]  Maybe
[3217.82 --> 3218.96]  even to have
[3218.96 --> 3219.68]  unwanted
[3219.68 --> 3220.56]  pregnancies,
[3220.56 --> 3221.28]  but there is
[3221.28 --> 3221.84]  no such thing
[3221.84 --> 3222.16]  as having
[3222.16 --> 3222.98]  an unwanted
[3222.98 --> 3223.52]  adoption.
[3224.32 --> 3224.42]  Right?
[3224.46 --> 3224.94]  No one wakes
[3224.94 --> 3225.58]  up one day
[3225.58 --> 3226.24]  and suddenly
[3226.24 --> 3227.00]  discovers they
[3227.00 --> 3227.92]  adopted somebody
[3227.92 --> 3228.64]  by mistake
[3228.64 --> 3229.18]  and they never
[3229.18 --> 3229.84]  intended to.
[3230.46 --> 3230.60]  Right?
[3231.16 --> 3232.06]  Adoption is a
[3232.06 --> 3233.50]  very long
[3233.50 --> 3234.10]  and hard
[3234.10 --> 3234.70]  process.
[3234.96 --> 3235.26]  It's often
[3235.26 --> 3235.90]  expensive.
[3236.42 --> 3236.68]  There are
[3236.68 --> 3237.34]  social workers
[3237.34 --> 3237.80]  involved.
[3238.08 --> 3238.66]  There's legal
[3238.66 --> 3239.20]  paperwork.
[3239.90 --> 3240.42]  It's very
[3240.42 --> 3240.90]  difficult.
[3241.60 --> 3242.20]  But friends,
[3242.32 --> 3243.02]  this is the
[3243.02 --> 3243.58]  language that
[3243.58 --> 3244.24]  God uses,
[3244.54 --> 3245.04]  that you have
[3245.04 --> 3245.82]  been adopted,
[3246.00 --> 3246.50]  that God
[3246.50 --> 3247.62]  had this plan
[3247.62 --> 3248.34]  that he saw
[3248.34 --> 3249.00]  through at
[3249.00 --> 3249.86]  great expense
[3249.86 --> 3251.24]  to himself
[3251.24 --> 3252.04]  and the
[3252.04 --> 3252.36]  death of
[3252.36 --> 3252.76]  his son,
[3252.80 --> 3253.10]  as we're
[3253.10 --> 3253.32]  going to
[3253.32 --> 3253.66]  see.
[3254.18 --> 3255.00]  God adopted
[3255.00 --> 3256.34]  you as
[3256.34 --> 3257.64]  sons and
[3257.64 --> 3257.96]  daughters.
[3258.88 --> 3259.66]  So here's
[3259.66 --> 3260.02]  the question
[3260.02 --> 3260.40]  for us
[3260.40 --> 3260.80]  this morning.
[3261.66 --> 3262.00]  Do you
[3262.00 --> 3263.20]  know this
[3263.20 --> 3263.80]  morning that
[3263.80 --> 3264.46]  God has
[3264.46 --> 3265.60]  chosen you
[3265.60 --> 3266.64]  to be his
[3266.64 --> 3267.02]  child?
[3268.14 --> 3268.36]  Right?
[3268.46 --> 3269.10]  God has
[3269.10 --> 3269.94]  no unwanted
[3269.94 --> 3270.54]  children.
[3271.72 --> 3272.50]  You weren't
[3272.50 --> 3273.24]  a mistake.
[3273.86 --> 3274.54]  Your father
[3274.54 --> 3275.62]  sought you
[3275.62 --> 3276.54]  out and
[3276.54 --> 3277.36]  planned not
[3277.36 --> 3277.96]  only to bring
[3277.96 --> 3278.46]  you into
[3278.46 --> 3279.06]  this world
[3279.06 --> 3279.42]  but to
[3279.42 --> 3280.08]  adopt you
[3280.08 --> 3280.64]  into his
[3280.64 --> 3280.98]  family.
[3282.74 --> 3283.42]  So that
[3283.42 --> 3284.26]  is the
[3284.26 --> 3284.92]  plan of
[3284.92 --> 3285.36]  the father.
[3286.18 --> 3286.92]  And the
[3286.92 --> 3287.38]  second thing
[3287.38 --> 3287.80]  we see is
[3287.80 --> 3288.10]  not just
[3288.10 --> 3288.44]  the plan
[3288.44 --> 3288.70]  of the
[3288.70 --> 3289.20]  father but
[3289.20 --> 3290.32]  also the
[3290.32 --> 3291.22]  purchase of
[3291.22 --> 3291.76]  the son.
[3292.50 --> 3292.90]  So that's
[3292.90 --> 3293.20]  our next
[3293.20 --> 3293.52]  point.
[3294.82 --> 3295.28]  So in
[3295.28 --> 3295.88]  the ancient
[3295.88 --> 3296.38]  world,
[3296.58 --> 3297.26]  if someone
[3297.26 --> 3297.90]  was a
[3297.90 --> 3298.52]  slave,
[3298.72 --> 3299.28]  to get
[3299.28 --> 3299.98]  their freedom,
[3300.56 --> 3300.98]  they had to
[3300.98 --> 3301.62]  be redeemed.
[3302.22 --> 3302.42]  Right?
[3302.46 --> 3302.94]  That's where
[3302.94 --> 3303.44]  the word
[3303.44 --> 3304.06]  comes from.
[3304.18 --> 3304.56]  It means
[3304.56 --> 3305.58]  redemption
[3305.58 --> 3306.04]  means to
[3306.04 --> 3306.64]  buy someone's
[3306.64 --> 3306.96]  freedom.
[3306.96 --> 3307.94]  And the
[3307.94 --> 3308.76]  idea of
[3308.76 --> 3309.10]  redemption
[3309.10 --> 3309.88]  is essentially
[3309.88 --> 3310.66]  that a
[3310.66 --> 3311.30]  price is
[3311.30 --> 3312.66]  paid so
[3312.66 --> 3314.28]  that ownership
[3314.28 --> 3314.82]  is then
[3314.82 --> 3316.22]  transferred from
[3316.22 --> 3317.04]  one person to
[3317.04 --> 3317.48]  the other.
[3317.64 --> 3317.80]  Right?
[3317.82 --> 3318.00]  And we
[3318.00 --> 3318.52]  understand how
[3318.52 --> 3318.98]  this works.
[3319.04 --> 3319.44]  We understand
[3319.44 --> 3319.92]  the market.
[3320.22 --> 3320.70]  You purchase
[3320.70 --> 3321.22]  something and
[3321.22 --> 3321.98]  now it
[3321.98 --> 3322.32]  belongs to
[3322.32 --> 3322.74]  this person.
[3322.84 --> 3323.32]  You purchased
[3323.32 --> 3323.66]  it.
[3323.96 --> 3324.44]  You paid
[3324.44 --> 3325.50]  the price and
[3325.50 --> 3325.78]  now it
[3325.78 --> 3326.28]  belongs to
[3326.28 --> 3326.54]  you.
[3327.26 --> 3327.66]  Scripture
[3327.66 --> 3328.24]  says that
[3328.24 --> 3328.66]  we have
[3328.66 --> 3329.66]  been redeemed
[3329.66 --> 3330.54]  from under
[3330.54 --> 3331.04]  the curse
[3331.04 --> 3331.58]  of the law
[3331.58 --> 3332.20]  to become
[3332.20 --> 3332.56]  God's
[3332.56 --> 3332.86]  children.
[3333.22 --> 3333.76]  We were
[3333.76 --> 3334.60]  enslaved to
[3334.60 --> 3335.04]  the law.
[3335.72 --> 3336.70]  God paid
[3336.70 --> 3337.38]  the price.
[3337.68 --> 3338.44]  He purchased
[3338.44 --> 3338.76]  us.
[3338.82 --> 3339.42]  He redeemed
[3339.42 --> 3339.82]  us and
[3339.82 --> 3340.14]  now we
[3340.14 --> 3340.66]  belong to
[3340.66 --> 3340.92]  him.
[3341.98 --> 3342.54]  And because
[3342.54 --> 3343.46]  we now
[3343.46 --> 3344.04]  have been
[3344.04 --> 3344.64]  purchased by
[3344.64 --> 3345.74]  God, we
[3345.74 --> 3346.42]  are his
[3346.42 --> 3346.82]  children.
[3347.50 --> 3347.76]  Right?
[3347.82 --> 3348.52]  He is now
[3348.52 --> 3349.90]  responsible for
[3349.90 --> 3350.36]  us.
[3350.64 --> 3351.38]  We are
[3351.38 --> 3352.48]  his.
[3353.60 --> 3354.60]  So I heard
[3354.60 --> 3355.28]  this story
[3355.28 --> 3356.04]  that a
[3356.04 --> 3356.68]  preacher would
[3356.68 --> 3357.28]  tell about
[3357.28 --> 3357.66]  a little
[3357.66 --> 3359.40]  boy and
[3359.40 --> 3359.84]  a little
[3359.84 --> 3361.32]  boat that
[3361.32 --> 3362.08]  this boy
[3362.08 --> 3362.90]  had made
[3362.90 --> 3363.40]  himself,
[3363.50 --> 3363.86]  that he had
[3363.86 --> 3364.28]  crafted.
[3364.28 --> 3365.54]  So this
[3365.54 --> 3366.00]  boy went
[3366.00 --> 3366.66]  down to
[3366.66 --> 3367.52]  a pond
[3367.52 --> 3368.16]  by his
[3368.16 --> 3369.00]  house and
[3369.00 --> 3369.46]  he put
[3369.46 --> 3370.04]  the boat
[3370.04 --> 3370.60]  in the
[3370.60 --> 3371.64]  water and
[3371.64 --> 3371.98]  all of a
[3371.98 --> 3372.50]  sudden a
[3372.50 --> 3373.34]  big gust of
[3373.34 --> 3374.10]  wind blew
[3374.10 --> 3374.76]  and it
[3374.76 --> 3375.42]  carried the
[3375.42 --> 3375.82]  boat to
[3375.82 --> 3376.34]  the other
[3376.34 --> 3377.48]  side of
[3377.48 --> 3377.98]  this big
[3377.98 --> 3378.44]  pond.
[3379.72 --> 3380.42]  And the
[3380.42 --> 3381.30]  boy ran
[3381.30 --> 3382.20]  around the
[3382.20 --> 3382.72]  pond.
[3383.12 --> 3383.44]  It took
[3383.44 --> 3383.86]  him a
[3383.86 --> 3384.50]  while but
[3384.50 --> 3385.00]  he got to
[3385.00 --> 3385.32]  the other
[3385.32 --> 3386.34]  side to
[3386.34 --> 3387.14]  rescue his
[3387.14 --> 3388.46]  boat but
[3388.46 --> 3389.00]  when he got
[3389.00 --> 3390.22]  there it
[3390.22 --> 3390.70]  was gone.
[3391.96 --> 3392.86]  He searched
[3392.86 --> 3393.38]  all around
[3393.38 --> 3393.58]  and he
[3393.58 --> 3393.84]  couldn't
[3393.84 --> 3394.24]  find it.
[3394.32 --> 3395.26]  So tearful
[3395.26 --> 3396.28]  and broken
[3396.28 --> 3397.10]  hearted he
[3397.10 --> 3397.76]  goes home.
[3398.70 --> 3399.00]  But a
[3399.00 --> 3399.42]  couple weeks
[3399.42 --> 3401.00]  later he
[3401.00 --> 3401.64]  to his
[3401.64 --> 3402.62]  surprise he
[3402.62 --> 3403.64]  sees his
[3403.64 --> 3404.48]  little boat
[3404.48 --> 3405.76]  in the
[3405.76 --> 3407.58]  window of
[3407.58 --> 3408.06]  a shop
[3408.06 --> 3410.22]  right in
[3410.22 --> 3410.44]  his
[3410.44 --> 3410.80]  neighborhood.
[3411.10 --> 3411.62]  It's in
[3411.62 --> 3412.02]  the window
[3412.02 --> 3412.50]  and it
[3412.50 --> 3413.60]  says $30.
[3414.94 --> 3415.70]  So he
[3415.70 --> 3416.16]  goes into
[3416.16 --> 3416.64]  the store
[3416.64 --> 3416.96]  and he
[3416.96 --> 3417.88]  says that's
[3417.88 --> 3418.56]  my boat
[3418.56 --> 3420.14]  and the
[3420.14 --> 3420.76]  shop owner
[3420.76 --> 3421.70]  says yes
[3421.70 --> 3422.26]  that is your
[3422.26 --> 3422.78]  boat for
[3422.78 --> 3423.06]  $30.
[3424.42 --> 3425.08]  So the
[3425.08 --> 3425.46]  boy goes
[3425.46 --> 3426.92]  home and
[3426.92 --> 3427.64]  he starts
[3427.64 --> 3428.10]  collecting
[3428.10 --> 3428.70]  recycling.
[3429.08 --> 3429.66]  He mows
[3429.66 --> 3430.34]  the lawn.
[3430.74 --> 3431.24]  He scrapes
[3431.24 --> 3431.84]  together some
[3431.84 --> 3432.82]  money and
[3432.82 --> 3434.00]  every day he's
[3434.00 --> 3434.68]  going by the
[3434.68 --> 3435.20]  store and he's
[3435.20 --> 3436.58]  checking to
[3436.58 --> 3437.00]  see if the
[3437.00 --> 3437.54]  boat is still
[3437.54 --> 3437.86]  there.
[3438.60 --> 3439.16]  Finally he
[3439.16 --> 3439.70]  gets all the
[3439.70 --> 3440.54]  money together
[3440.54 --> 3441.06]  and he goes
[3441.06 --> 3441.44]  into the
[3441.44 --> 3441.96]  shop and he
[3441.96 --> 3442.52]  dumps it on
[3442.52 --> 3442.98]  the counter
[3442.98 --> 3444.42]  and he gets
[3444.42 --> 3445.18]  his boat
[3445.18 --> 3445.96]  back.
[3447.54 --> 3448.84]  And as he
[3448.84 --> 3449.38]  walked out of
[3449.38 --> 3449.98]  the shop he
[3449.98 --> 3450.60]  has heard to
[3450.60 --> 3452.00]  say little
[3452.00 --> 3453.26]  boat I
[3453.26 --> 3453.88]  made you.
[3454.52 --> 3454.98]  Little
[3454.98 --> 3455.48]  boat I
[3455.48 --> 3456.46]  lost you.
[3457.10 --> 3457.52]  But little
[3457.52 --> 3457.96]  boat I
[3457.96 --> 3458.72]  found you
[3458.72 --> 3459.54]  and I
[3459.54 --> 3460.36]  bought you
[3460.36 --> 3461.20]  and you
[3461.20 --> 3462.02]  are now
[3462.02 --> 3462.86]  mine.
[3463.40 --> 3463.76]  You are
[3463.76 --> 3464.58]  back where
[3464.58 --> 3465.28]  you belong.
[3466.74 --> 3467.06]  And friends
[3467.06 --> 3467.58]  that is what
[3467.58 --> 3468.08]  God has done
[3468.08 --> 3468.64]  for us.
[3469.26 --> 3469.36]  Right?
[3469.40 --> 3469.82]  That is a
[3469.82 --> 3470.54]  picture of
[3470.54 --> 3471.06]  the gospel.
[3472.34 --> 3472.92]  When the
[3472.92 --> 3473.76]  set time had
[3473.76 --> 3474.48]  fully come
[3474.48 --> 3475.10]  God sent
[3475.10 --> 3475.88]  his son born
[3475.88 --> 3476.40]  of a woman
[3476.40 --> 3477.00]  born under
[3477.00 --> 3477.58]  the law
[3477.58 --> 3478.72]  to redeem
[3478.72 --> 3479.00]  you.
[3480.02 --> 3480.14]  Right?
[3480.22 --> 3480.76]  Jesus came
[3480.76 --> 3481.12]  into the
[3481.12 --> 3481.78]  world born
[3481.78 --> 3482.42]  of a woman
[3482.42 --> 3483.26]  born under
[3483.26 --> 3483.82]  the law.
[3484.34 --> 3484.56]  Right?
[3484.62 --> 3485.14]  Remember we
[3485.14 --> 3485.76]  are slaves
[3485.76 --> 3486.56]  to the law
[3486.56 --> 3487.38]  so Jesus
[3487.38 --> 3488.30]  came and
[3488.30 --> 3488.76]  he kept
[3488.76 --> 3489.32]  all the
[3489.32 --> 3490.00]  requirements
[3490.00 --> 3490.68]  of the
[3490.68 --> 3490.96]  law.
[3491.32 --> 3491.90]  Jesus kept
[3491.90 --> 3492.28]  the law
[3492.28 --> 3492.58]  of God
[3492.58 --> 3493.18]  perfectly.
[3493.64 --> 3494.00]  We weren't
[3494.00 --> 3494.40]  able to
[3494.40 --> 3494.66]  keep it
[3494.66 --> 3495.08]  perfectly
[3495.08 --> 3495.90]  but Jesus
[3495.90 --> 3496.46]  kept it
[3496.46 --> 3496.88]  perfectly
[3496.88 --> 3498.50]  and not
[3498.50 --> 3499.08]  only did
[3499.08 --> 3499.44]  he keep
[3499.44 --> 3499.88]  the law
[3499.88 --> 3500.54]  for us
[3500.54 --> 3501.10]  on our
[3501.10 --> 3501.46]  behalf
[3501.46 --> 3502.88]  but he
[3502.88 --> 3503.50]  also paid
[3503.50 --> 3504.16]  the debt
[3504.16 --> 3505.26]  of our
[3505.26 --> 3506.40]  inability to
[3506.40 --> 3506.80]  keep the
[3506.80 --> 3507.28]  law by
[3507.28 --> 3507.78]  dying on
[3507.78 --> 3508.38]  the cross
[3508.38 --> 3509.02]  as a
[3509.02 --> 3509.42]  sacrifice
[3509.42 --> 3509.98]  for sin
[3509.98 --> 3510.20]  in our
[3510.20 --> 3510.58]  place.
[3511.56 --> 3511.84]  And Paul
[3511.84 --> 3512.28]  is telling
[3512.28 --> 3512.68]  us that
[3512.68 --> 3513.12]  this is
[3513.12 --> 3514.34]  how we
[3514.34 --> 3515.08]  have gotten
[3515.08 --> 3515.86]  into this
[3515.86 --> 3516.30]  sonship.
[3516.84 --> 3517.08]  Right?
[3517.14 --> 3517.90]  That legally
[3517.90 --> 3519.46]  we have
[3519.46 --> 3520.02]  been transferred
[3520.02 --> 3521.66]  and through
[3521.66 --> 3522.50]  what price?
[3523.12 --> 3523.50]  By the
[3523.50 --> 3524.52]  price of
[3524.52 --> 3524.98]  Christ.
[3526.50 --> 3527.30]  So friends
[3527.30 --> 3527.72]  what this
[3527.72 --> 3528.42]  means is
[3528.42 --> 3528.74]  and what I
[3528.74 --> 3529.02]  want you
[3529.02 --> 3529.34]  to hear
[3529.34 --> 3529.64]  is that
[3529.64 --> 3530.44]  your status
[3530.44 --> 3532.22]  as a
[3532.22 --> 3532.92]  son or
[3532.92 --> 3533.72]  daughter of
[3533.72 --> 3534.18]  God
[3534.18 --> 3535.02]  scripture
[3535.02 --> 3535.58]  is showing
[3535.58 --> 3536.16]  us is
[3536.16 --> 3536.54]  legal.
[3537.28 --> 3537.78]  It is
[3537.78 --> 3538.46]  binding.
[3538.74 --> 3539.00]  It is
[3539.00 --> 3539.90]  irreversible.
[3540.06 --> 3540.32]  Jesus
[3540.32 --> 3541.06]  has paid
[3541.06 --> 3542.00]  the price.
[3542.96 --> 3543.06]  Right?
[3543.14 --> 3543.60]  Paul says
[3543.60 --> 3544.04]  in Romans
[3544.04 --> 3544.42]  8 that
[3544.42 --> 3545.04]  nothing in
[3545.04 --> 3545.78]  all creation
[3545.78 --> 3546.86]  is able
[3546.86 --> 3547.40]  to separate
[3547.40 --> 3547.80]  you from
[3547.80 --> 3548.22]  the love
[3548.22 --> 3548.60]  of God
[3548.60 --> 3549.10]  in Christ
[3549.10 --> 3549.44]  because
[3549.44 --> 3549.86]  legally
[3549.86 --> 3550.10]  the
[3550.10 --> 3550.46]  transfer
[3550.46 --> 3550.98]  is done.
[3551.42 --> 3551.56]  We
[3551.56 --> 3552.24]  are
[3552.24 --> 3553.00]  God's
[3553.00 --> 3553.36]  children.
[3555.54 --> 3555.74]  You know
[3555.74 --> 3556.82]  for some
[3556.82 --> 3557.98]  of us
[3557.98 --> 3558.46]  today
[3558.46 --> 3559.86]  our
[3559.86 --> 3560.58]  relationship
[3560.58 --> 3561.14]  with
[3561.14 --> 3561.60]  God
[3561.60 --> 3562.30]  can
[3562.30 --> 3563.06]  often
[3563.06 --> 3563.52]  times
[3563.52 --> 3564.06]  be
[3564.06 --> 3566.06]  based
[3566.06 --> 3566.28]  on
[3566.28 --> 3566.44]  our
[3566.44 --> 3566.98]  feelings.
[3567.94 --> 3568.04]  Right?
[3568.38 --> 3568.86]  And God
[3568.86 --> 3569.18]  does not
[3569.18 --> 3569.52]  want to
[3569.52 --> 3570.92]  dismiss
[3570.92 --> 3571.28]  our
[3571.28 --> 3571.72]  feelings
[3571.72 --> 3573.02]  but
[3573.02 --> 3573.22]  our
[3573.22 --> 3573.88]  feelings
[3573.88 --> 3574.34]  or how
[3574.34 --> 3575.00]  close
[3575.00 --> 3575.20]  we
[3575.20 --> 3575.44]  feel
[3575.44 --> 3575.64]  to
[3575.64 --> 3575.92]  God
[3575.92 --> 3576.12]  is
[3576.12 --> 3576.40]  not
[3576.40 --> 3576.64]  what
[3576.64 --> 3576.78]  is
[3576.78 --> 3577.02]  most
[3577.02 --> 3577.68]  fundamental
[3577.68 --> 3578.36]  to
[3578.36 --> 3578.58]  our
[3578.58 --> 3579.08]  identity
[3579.08 --> 3579.82]  and
[3579.82 --> 3580.08]  our
[3580.08 --> 3580.64]  position
[3580.64 --> 3581.04]  before
[3581.04 --> 3581.40]  God.
[3582.36 --> 3583.02]  So our
[3583.02 --> 3583.30]  feelings
[3583.30 --> 3584.00]  are important
[3584.00 --> 3584.54]  as we're
[3584.54 --> 3584.72]  going to
[3584.72 --> 3585.08]  see
[3585.08 --> 3585.76]  next
[3585.76 --> 3586.74]  but
[3586.74 --> 3586.92]  the
[3586.92 --> 3587.32]  basis
[3587.32 --> 3587.72]  of
[3587.72 --> 3587.90]  our
[3587.90 --> 3588.60]  relationship
[3588.60 --> 3589.56]  is
[3589.56 --> 3589.76]  the
[3589.76 --> 3590.32]  objective
[3590.32 --> 3591.06]  work
[3591.06 --> 3591.28]  of
[3591.28 --> 3591.76]  Christ
[3591.76 --> 3591.96]  and
[3591.96 --> 3592.10]  what
[3592.10 --> 3592.24]  he
[3592.24 --> 3592.40]  has
[3592.40 --> 3592.66]  done.
[3593.72 --> 3594.34]  So this
[3594.34 --> 3594.58]  means
[3594.58 --> 3594.82]  friends
[3594.82 --> 3594.96]  that
[3594.96 --> 3595.36]  regardless
[3595.36 --> 3595.80]  of how
[3595.80 --> 3596.00]  you
[3596.00 --> 3596.52]  feel
[3596.52 --> 3597.32]  if
[3597.32 --> 3597.60]  you
[3597.60 --> 3598.12]  have
[3598.12 --> 3598.58]  repented
[3598.58 --> 3598.78]  of
[3598.78 --> 3598.96]  your
[3598.96 --> 3599.38]  sins
[3599.38 --> 3600.20]  if
[3600.20 --> 3600.32]  you
[3600.32 --> 3600.46]  have
[3600.46 --> 3600.66]  put
[3600.66 --> 3600.80]  your
[3600.80 --> 3601.04]  faith
[3601.04 --> 3601.22]  in
[3601.22 --> 3601.68]  Christ
[3601.68 --> 3602.32]  you
[3602.32 --> 3602.92]  are
[3602.92 --> 3603.48]  a
[3603.48 --> 3603.86]  son
[3603.86 --> 3604.02]  or
[3604.02 --> 3604.32]  daughter
[3604.32 --> 3604.52]  of
[3604.52 --> 3604.78]  God.
[3605.42 --> 3605.74]  And
[3605.74 --> 3605.96]  that
[3605.96 --> 3606.34]  means
[3606.34 --> 3606.62]  that
[3606.62 --> 3607.00]  God
[3607.00 --> 3607.24]  is
[3607.24 --> 3607.38]  your
[3607.38 --> 3607.70]  father
[3607.70 --> 3608.02]  and
[3608.02 --> 3608.16]  what
[3608.16 --> 3608.30]  that
[3608.30 --> 3608.50]  means
[3608.50 --> 3608.62]  is
[3608.62 --> 3608.76]  that
[3608.76 --> 3608.88]  you
[3608.88 --> 3609.06]  can
[3609.06 --> 3609.28]  draw
[3609.28 --> 3609.52]  near
[3609.52 --> 3609.66]  to
[3609.66 --> 3609.96]  God.
[3610.88 --> 3610.98]  You
[3610.98 --> 3611.42]  have
[3611.42 --> 3611.94]  the
[3611.94 --> 3612.26]  full
[3615.76 --> 3616.08]  especially
[3616.08 --> 3616.36]  in
[3616.36 --> 3616.54]  those
[3616.54 --> 3616.84]  times
[3616.84 --> 3617.08]  when
[3617.08 --> 3617.36]  we
[3617.36 --> 3618.66]  feel
[3618.66 --> 3619.66]  more
[3619.66 --> 3620.06]  distant
[3620.06 --> 3620.32]  from
[3620.32 --> 3620.76]  God
[3620.76 --> 3622.80]  maybe
[3622.80 --> 3623.40]  furthest
[3623.40 --> 3623.82]  from
[3623.82 --> 3624.08]  him
[3624.08 --> 3624.46]  that's
[3624.46 --> 3624.98]  when
[3624.98 --> 3625.78]  you
[3625.78 --> 3626.22]  need
[3626.22 --> 3626.42]  to
[3626.42 --> 3626.78]  draw
[3626.78 --> 3627.24]  close
[3627.24 --> 3627.40]  to
[3627.40 --> 3627.54]  him
[3627.54 --> 3627.72]  by
[3627.72 --> 3628.08]  faith.
[3630.46 --> 3630.70]  Okay
[3630.70 --> 3631.18]  so
[3631.18 --> 3633.60]  thirdly
[3633.60 --> 3634.38]  you know
[3634.38 --> 3634.70]  we've
[3634.70 --> 3635.12]  seen
[3635.12 --> 3635.56]  the
[3635.56 --> 3635.94]  plan
[3635.94 --> 3636.10]  of
[3636.10 --> 3636.24]  the
[3636.24 --> 3636.60]  father
[3636.60 --> 3637.58]  the
[3637.58 --> 3638.04]  work
[3638.04 --> 3638.24]  of
[3638.24 --> 3638.44]  the

[3641.34 --> 3642.34]  and
[3642.34 --> 3642.52]  now
[3642.52 --> 3642.70]  we're
[3642.70 --> 3642.78]  going
[3642.78 --> 3642.88]  to
[3642.88 --> 3643.02]  see
[3643.02 --> 3643.20]  the

[3644.26 --> 3645.46]  and

[3645.58 --> 3645.78]  see

[3646.32 --> 3646.68]  six

[3647.24 --> 3647.36]  it
[3647.36 --> 3647.50]  says
[3647.50 --> 3647.74]  because
[3647.74 --> 3648.24]  you
[3648.24 --> 3648.48]  are

[3668.98 --> 3669.30]  deeply
[3669.30 --> 3669.90]  personal
[3669.90 --> 3670.52]  something

[3801.98 --> 3802.88]  affection
[3802.88 --> 3803.66]  and the
[3803.66 --> 3803.86]  answer
[3803.86 --> 3804.02]  is
[3804.02 --> 3804.50]  no
[3804.50 --> 3805.44]  he

[3805.84 --> 3806.22]  son
[3806.22 --> 3806.42]  when
[3806.42 --> 3806.58]  he

[3806.76 --> 3807.12]  walking

[3813.36 --> 3814.18]  his
[3814.18 --> 3814.66]  status
[3814.66 --> 3815.04]  hasn't
[3815.04 --> 3815.54]  changed
[3815.54 --> 3816.38]  but his
[3816.38 --> 3817.14]  experience
[3817.14 --> 3817.78]  of being
[3817.78 --> 3818.40]  a son
[3818.40 --> 3819.16]  is now
[3819.16 --> 3819.86]  completely
[3819.86 --> 3820.34]  different
[3820.34 --> 3821.70]  and what
[3821.70 --> 3822.14]  Paul is
[3822.14 --> 3822.42]  saying
[3822.42 --> 3822.94]  here
[3822.94 --> 3823.62]  is that
[3823.62 --> 3824.02]  God
[3824.02 --> 3824.72]  gives you
[3824.72 --> 3824.90]  the
[3824.90 --> 3825.12]  Holy
[3825.12 --> 3825.54]  Spirit
[3825.54 --> 3826.74]  and in
[3826.74 --> 3827.46]  doing so
[3827.46 --> 3828.28]  this is
[3828.28 --> 3828.58]  God's
[3828.58 --> 3829.02]  embrace
[3829.02 --> 3829.82]  this is

[3830.18 --> 3830.92]  kissing
[3830.92 --> 3831.34]  you
[3831.34 --> 3832.32]  in this
[3832.32 --> 3832.60]  way
[3832.60 --> 3833.96]  what the
[3833.96 --> 3834.40]  spirit of
[3834.40 --> 3834.94]  God does
[3834.94 --> 3835.50]  is allow

[3838.20 --> 3838.60]  as
[3838.60 --> 3838.96]  father
[3838.96 --> 3840.76]  so
[3840.76 --> 3840.90]  the
[3840.90 --> 3841.24]  question
[3841.24 --> 3842.04]  for

[3846.92 --> 3847.10]  of
[3847.10 --> 3847.38]  God
[3847.38 --> 3848.40]  the
[3848.40 --> 3848.64]  Bible
[3848.64 --> 3848.96]  says

[3849.38 --> 3849.72]  faith
[3849.72 --> 3849.94]  in
[3849.94 --> 3850.38]  Christ
[3850.38 --> 3850.60]  then
[3850.60 --> 3850.94]  God
[3850.94 --> 3851.16]  is
[3851.16 --> 3851.30]  your

[3852.78 --> 3852.94]  the
[3852.94 --> 3853.14]  right

[3858.84 --> 3859.88]  the
[3859.88 --> 3860.18]  question
[3860.18 --> 3860.44]  is
[3860.44 --> 3860.76]  why

[4131.58 --> 4142.58]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4142.58 --> 4155.58]  In my life and in death to your love was my love.
[4155.58 --> 4160.58]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4160.58 --> 4165.58]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4165.58 --> 4170.58]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4170.58 --> 4174.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4174.70 --> 4181.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4181.70 --> 4187.70]  Always by your Holy Spirit you assure me.
[4187.70 --> 4193.70]  I'll return your life and make me willing and ready.
[4193.70 --> 4206.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4206.70 --> 4210.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4210.70 --> 4222.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4222.70 --> 4227.70]  In my life and in death to your love.
[4227.70 --> 4232.70]  I am not my own, but belong body and soul.
[4232.70 --> 4239.54]  I am not my own
[4239.54 --> 4242.62]  But belong
[4242.62 --> 4246.12]  Body and soul
[4246.12 --> 4249.12]  In my life
[4249.12 --> 4252.20]  And in death
[4252.20 --> 4255.46]  To you, Lord
[4255.46 --> 4258.76]  Was my Lord
[4262.70 --> 4268.30]  So we come now to this community prayer
[4268.30 --> 4270.98]  And today I want to do something a little bit different
[4270.98 --> 4274.62]  Which is to pray for mothers
[4274.62 --> 4276.04]  Because it's Mother's Day
[4276.04 --> 4280.24]  And this is actually a prayer written by Jan DeBoer
[4280.24 --> 4283.82]  I found it on the Reformed Worship resource
[4283.82 --> 4286.76]  And it's a prayer that is based on the fruit of the Spirit
[4286.76 --> 4288.46]  From Galatians 5.22
[4288.46 --> 4290.52]  And here is the verse
[4290.52 --> 4293.18]  But the fruit of the Spirit is love
[4293.18 --> 4294.42]  Joy
[4294.42 --> 4295.80]  Peace
[4295.80 --> 4297.30]  Forbearance
[4297.30 --> 4298.62]  Kindness
[4298.62 --> 4299.46]  Goodness
[4299.46 --> 4300.78]  Faithfulness
[4300.78 --> 4302.74]  Gentleness and self-control
[4302.74 --> 4306.14]  So let's bow our hearts
[4306.14 --> 4308.24]  Come together in this time of prayer
[4308.24 --> 4312.10]  Heavenly Father
[4312.10 --> 4313.78]  We thank and praise you
[4313.78 --> 4315.56]  For your gift of the Holy Spirit
[4315.56 --> 4317.80]  Who works in the lives
[4317.80 --> 4319.22]  Of our mothers
[4319.22 --> 4320.46]  And our children
[4320.46 --> 4323.80]  We thank you for the fruit of love
[4323.80 --> 4327.14]  Scripture tells us to love one another
[4327.14 --> 4329.22]  As you have loved us
[4329.22 --> 4331.58]  Help us to love our children
[4331.58 --> 4333.42]  With the unconditional love
[4333.42 --> 4335.40]  You have for us
[4335.40 --> 4337.84]  We thank you, Lord
[4337.84 --> 4339.54]  For the joys of parenthood
[4339.54 --> 4341.58]  For the newborn baby
[4341.58 --> 4343.42]  For first words
[4343.42 --> 4345.38]  For bedtime prayers
[4345.38 --> 4348.08]  For commitments made to serve you
[4348.08 --> 4351.36]  For spiritual growth and maturity in our children
[4351.36 --> 4354.16]  The joy of the Lord is our strength
[4354.16 --> 4357.94]  Some of us don't know this joy, Lord
[4357.94 --> 4360.02]  Our joy has been taken away
[4360.02 --> 4362.28]  By the unfulfilled desire for children
[4362.28 --> 4364.08]  By miscarriage
[4364.08 --> 4365.34]  Or by the loss of a child
[4365.34 --> 4367.50]  Others suffer pain
[4367.50 --> 4369.72]  Because their parents are now in heaven with you
[4369.72 --> 4372.68]  And they are deeply missed today
[4372.68 --> 4375.04]  Restore joy
[4375.04 --> 4377.50]  Where there is sorrow and loss
[4377.50 --> 4380.64]  We long for the peace
[4380.64 --> 4382.32]  That transcends understanding
[4382.32 --> 4386.08]  When situations in our children's lives
[4386.08 --> 4386.90]  Are uncertain
[4386.90 --> 4389.36]  Grant us your peace
[4389.36 --> 4391.84]  To guard our hearts and minds
[4391.84 --> 4394.78]  Instill peace in the hearts of mothers
[4394.78 --> 4396.76]  Who have the overwhelming task
[4396.76 --> 4399.10]  Of raising a family by themselves
[4399.10 --> 4401.50]  Thank you for your promise
[4401.50 --> 4403.90]  To be a father to the fatherless
[4403.90 --> 4407.92]  We confess that we do not always demonstrate
[4407.92 --> 4409.84]  The long-enduring patience
[4409.84 --> 4412.36]  With our own children that you show us
[4412.36 --> 4415.08]  Forgive us when we are too demanding
[4415.08 --> 4417.62]  And expect too much too soon
[4417.62 --> 4421.94]  Thank you for the kindness shown to each of us
[4421.94 --> 4422.78]  By our mothers
[4422.78 --> 4426.22]  As our own parents face the difficulties of aging
[4426.22 --> 4429.32]  Help us to return kindness to them
[4429.32 --> 4430.10]  And honor them
[4430.10 --> 4432.26]  As your word commands
[4432.26 --> 4436.12]  In a world where evil seems to be everywhere
[4436.12 --> 4438.28]  May we demonstrate the goodness
[4438.28 --> 4441.04]  That Christ creates in our hearts
[4441.04 --> 4444.86]  Let our children see us as light in darkness
[4444.86 --> 4448.32]  As salt in a spoiling world
[4448.32 --> 4450.48]  As a shelter in the storm
[4450.48 --> 4453.66]  For your faithfulness to each of us
[4453.66 --> 4454.46]  We give thanks
[4454.46 --> 4456.40]  Thank you for faithful mothers
[4456.40 --> 4459.44]  Who shared their faith with us
[4459.44 --> 4460.78]  Who spent time in prayer
[4460.78 --> 4463.10]  And reading Bible stories to us
[4463.10 --> 4464.06]  In our early years
[4464.06 --> 4466.22]  Teaching us to love and trust you
[4466.22 --> 4470.42]  Let our gentleness be evident to all we meet
[4470.42 --> 4473.32]  Especially to those who share our home
[4473.32 --> 4476.42]  Let the light of Christ shine in our lives
[4476.42 --> 4478.62]  To show our children the way to you
[4478.62 --> 4482.24]  We admit, Lord, that none of us are perfect parents
[4482.24 --> 4485.86]  No matter how hard we may try on our own
[4485.86 --> 4489.58]  We rely on you to keep us from sin
[4489.58 --> 4492.24]  We cannot control ourselves
[4492.24 --> 4494.48]  Without your spirit working in our hearts
[4494.48 --> 4496.56]  Renewing us each day
[4496.56 --> 4498.94]  Since we live by the spirit
[4498.94 --> 4500.68]  Let us keep in step with the spirit
[4500.68 --> 4503.52]  Loving one another in obedience to Christ
[4503.52 --> 4506.98]  In our Savior's name we pray
[4506.98 --> 4508.30]  Amen
[4508.30 --> 4513.48]  So now, brothers and sisters
[4513.48 --> 4514.86]  We go forth from here
[4514.86 --> 4517.86]  With the Lord's blessing upon us
[4517.86 --> 4518.92]  He blesses us
[4518.92 --> 4521.54]  Because we are His children
[4521.54 --> 4522.76]  And He loves us
[4522.76 --> 4525.54]  Now may the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
[4525.54 --> 4526.86]  And God our Father
[4526.86 --> 4529.76]  Who loved us and gave us eternal comfort
[4529.76 --> 4531.72]  And good hope through grace
[4531.72 --> 4534.36]  Comfort your hearts and establish them
[4534.36 --> 4536.50]  In every good work and word
[4536.50 --> 4537.44]  Amen
[4537.44 --> 4557.50]  He is exalted
[4557.50 --> 4561.10]  The King is exalted on high
[4561.10 --> 4563.40]  And the glory is here
[4563.40 --> 4565.14]  He is exalted
[4565.14 --> 4566.04]  He is exalted forever
[4566.04 --> 4568.18]  Exalted in high
[4568.18 --> 4572.68]  And the glory is His name
[4572.68 --> 4578.04]  He is the Lord
[4578.04 --> 4582.18]  For in His joy shall reign
[4582.18 --> 4586.14]  Women and earth
[4586.14 --> 4589.40]  Rejoice is all in me
[4589.40 --> 4595.18]  He is exalted
[4595.18 --> 4596.02]  He is exalted
[4596.02 --> 4597.38]  He is exalted
[4597.38 --> 4597.82] hill
[4597.82 --> 4601.08]  He is exalted
[4601.08 --> 4605.88]  He is exalted, O Lord, and we praise Him.
[4606.16 --> 4610.66]  He is exalted forever, exalted in love.
[4611.10 --> 4614.88]  We'll praise His name.
[4617.68 --> 4624.52]  He is the Lord, forever His church shall reign.
[4624.52 --> 4632.82]  Live and enjoy, rejoice in His love and love.
[4633.32 --> 4638.28]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on earth.
[4640.80 --> 4646.36]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on earth.
[4654.52 --> 4684.50]  He is exalted, the King is exalted.
[4684.52 --> 4714.50]  He is exalted, the King is exalted.
[4714.52 --> 4743.38]  He is exalted, the King is exalted.
