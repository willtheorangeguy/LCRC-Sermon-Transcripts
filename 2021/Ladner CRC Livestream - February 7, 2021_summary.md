• Identifying what one trusts in and believes in
• Recognizing that trusting in something other than God can be an idol
• What Jesus wants us to believe and put our trust in, including:
  • Having a home with God, our Father
  • The concept of the Father's house
• The Bible describes heaven and earth as God's space and our space
• Jesus talks about heaven as the Father's house with many rooms
• Traditional views of heaven as a physical mansion in the sky are not accurate
• The metaphor of rooms represents dwelling in God's presence, not physical location
• This is an opportunity to understand heaven as a privilege of living in God's presence
• God as our Heavenly Father
• The Bible's depiction of God as a perfect, caring Father who provides and guides us
• Jesus' promise of a place in the Father's house for all his disciples
• A permanent, unshakable dwelling that cannot be lost or broken
• God's desire to dwell with each person and have them be with him
• Jesus is going to prepare a place in heaven for his followers
• The idea of Jesus preparing a place refers to his death on the cross, which makes a way for believers to be with God
• Jesus' departure from earth is necessary for him to make a way for his disciples to be with him forever
• Jesus reassures his disciples that there is a home with the Father and he has prepared the way for them.
• Jesus tells Thomas and the other disciples that he is the way itself, not just preparing a path for them.
• The disciples struggle to understand why Jesus must leave them and how they can know the way.
• Jesus answers by saying "I am the way" in response to their questions.
• The context of John 14:6, where Jesus says "I am the way and the truth and the life"
• Jesus is speaking to troubled disciples who are worried about his departure
• He's comforting them by saying he is the only way to God
• This statement has often been taken out of context and used to prove exclusivity of Christianity
• In reality, it was aimed at soothing their fears
• The phrase "I am" is a claim of divine identity, similar to the God who led his people out of Egypt
• Jesus says he is the way to get to God, in response to Thomas' question
• Thomas' question about Jesus showing the way
