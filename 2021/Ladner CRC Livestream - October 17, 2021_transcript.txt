[0.00 --> 7.86]  And hope is sure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[8.28 --> 17.00]  Come rejoice now, oh my soul, for His love is my reward.
[18.38 --> 27.00]  Fear is gone and hope is sure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[30.00 --> 40.06]  Am I not keys to Zion City? Where beside the King I walk?
[40.54 --> 49.76]  For there my heart has found His treasure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[49.76 --> 54.76]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[54.76 --> 59.76]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[59.76 --> 64.76]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[64.76 --> 71.76]  Ooooooh.
[71.76 --> 76.76]  Ooooooh.
[76.76 --> 79.76]  Ooooooh.
[79.76 --> 82.76]  Ooooooh.
[82.76 --> 83.76]  Ooooooh.
[83.76 --> 85.76]  Ooooooh.
[85.76 --> 90.76]  Teach us your ways.
[90.76 --> 95.76]  Teach us your ways.
[95.76 --> 100.76]  As we learn from one another.
[100.76 --> 104.76]  Learn to love each other.
[104.76 --> 108.76]  Teach us your ways.
[108.76 --> 109.76]  Teach us to give.
[109.76 --> 110.76]  Teach us to give.
[110.76 --> 111.76]  Teach us to give.
[111.76 --> 113.76]  Give ourselves for one another.
[113.76 --> 115.76]  Learn to love each other.
[115.76 --> 117.76]  Teach us to give.
[117.76 --> 118.76]  Teach us to give.
[118.76 --> 130.76]  Learn to love each other.
[130.76 --> 140.76]  Teach us to give.
[140.76 --> 146.22]  Teach us to lead.
[147.50 --> 152.44]  Teach us to lead.
[152.44 --> 157.04]  Let us weep with one another.
[157.94 --> 160.52]  Learn to love each other.
[161.40 --> 165.66]  Teach us to lead.
[170.76 --> 173.76]  Hallelujah.
[177.76 --> 179.76]  Hallelujah.
[179.76 --> 181.76]  Hallelujah.
[181.76 --> 186.76]  Let us learn from one another.
[186.76 --> 189.76]  Learn to love each other.
[189.76 --> 194.76]  Teach us your way.
[194.76 --> 201.76]  Do, do.
[201.76 --> 203.76]  Do.
[203.76 --> 205.76]  Do.
[205.76 --> 207.76]  Do.
[207.76 --> 209.76]  Do.
[209.76 --> 211.76]  Do.
[211.76 --> 213.76]  Do.
[213.76 --> 216.76]  Do.
[216.76 --> 218.76]  Do.
[230.76 --> 231.76]  Do.
[231.76 --> 232.76]  Do.
[232.76 --> 253.76]  My worth is not in what I own, not in the strength of flesh and bone, but in the costly wounds of love at the cross.
[253.76 --> 277.76]  My worth is not in skill or name, in win or lose, in pride or shame, but in the blood of Christ that flowed at the cross.
[277.76 --> 290.76]  I rejoice in my Redeemer, greatest treasure, wellspring of my soul.
[290.76 --> 301.76]  And I will trust in Him no other, my soul is satisfied in Him alone.
[301.76 --> 322.76]  As summer flowers we fade and die, fame, youth and beauty hurry by.
[322.76 --> 330.76]  I will trust in Him no other, my soul is satisfied.
[330.76 --> 336.76]  Well good morning, and welcome everyone to Latinx Christian Reformed Church.
[336.76 --> 342.76]  And a special welcome. If you're visiting with us this morning, we're certainly blessed by your presence among us
[342.76 --> 346.76]  and I pray that we in turn can be a blessing to you as we go through this service.
[346.76 --> 351.76]  A couple items I want to draw everybody's attention to from the bulletin.
[351.76 --> 358.76]  And first is, of course, the news that our brother Gert Van der Mühlen did pass away this past week to meet with the Lord.
[358.76 --> 366.76]  And first of all, we definitely grieve along with the Van der Mühlen family and think of Annette and Bill and Kim as they go through a difficult time.
[366.76 --> 373.76]  But note that on Thursday at 2 p.m. we will have a memorial service here in the church for Gert.
[373.76 --> 378.76]  And that's an opportunity to celebrate his life here with us.
[378.76 --> 385.76]  And the second is on Tuesday at Classis we'll be meeting via Zoom, a virtual Classis.
[385.76 --> 389.76]  And we do have two delegates, Pastor Jason and John, that we want to remember in our prayers.
[389.76 --> 395.76]  But very notably, Pastor Nancy will be passing a, or going through a, what do you call that?
[395.76 --> 398.76]  A, my goodness.
[398.76 --> 402.76]  Some kind of exam, a commissioned pastor exam. That's the word I was looking for, commissioned.
[402.76 --> 405.76]  I don't even really know what that is. But it's something significant.
[405.76 --> 409.76]  And so that will be available via Zoom.
[409.76 --> 414.76]  If you wanted to come to the church on Tuesday at 1, I believe there will be some viewing set up somehow.
[414.76 --> 419.76]  Or there's a link. I think you can reach out to Dorothy and she can provide you a link, I believe.
[419.76 --> 422.76]  Is that true, Pastor Jason? I read that somewhere.
[422.76 --> 423.76]  I think so, yeah.
[423.76 --> 424.76]  Yeah.
[424.76 --> 434.76]  So, yeah. We definitely want to keep Pastor Nancy in our prayers as well as she goes through that examination.
[434.76 --> 439.76]  Our greeting and call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 27 and John 4.
[439.76 --> 442.76]  Let us worship God, our light and our salvation.
[442.76 --> 446.76]  The Lord is the stronghold of our lives.
[446.76 --> 450.76]  We desire to live in God's house and to seek God in His holy temple.
[450.76 --> 455.76]  We have come with shouts of joy to sing and to make music to the Lord.
[455.76 --> 458.76]  Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[458.76 --> 464.76]  Teach us your ways and make straight our paths in this hour of worship always.
[464.76 --> 465.76]  Amen.
[465.76 --> 471.76]  And now is a good time to stand, if you can, and take a moment to greet those around you.
[471.76 --> 473.76]  Welcome them to our service.
[473.76 --> 476.76]  And directly after that, our worship team is going to lead us in three songs.
[476.76 --> 481.76]  Let us worship God in spirit and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing.
[481.76 --> 482.76]  09 people, our service team is on fire today.
[482.76 --> 484.76]  But we stand together before and tell you, many more performances.
[484.76 --> 493.04]  They거 Weaver, li Har
[493.04 --> 520.06]  Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
[520.06 --> 524.40]  the King of creation.
[525.72 --> 528.24]  O my soul, praise Him,
[528.24 --> 533.46]  for He is your health and salvation.
[534.96 --> 540.28]  Come, O Him, brothers and sisters,
[540.28 --> 547.44]  join me in my adoration.
[547.44 --> 554.54]  Praise to the Lord, who over all things
[554.54 --> 558.44]  is wondrously reigning,
[559.64 --> 563.18]  sheltering you under His wings,
[563.28 --> 567.34]  O so gently sustaining.
[567.34 --> 574.44]  Have you not seen all that is faithful
[574.44 --> 581.44]  has been sent by His gracious ordaining?
[583.44 --> 587.44]  Praise to the Lord, who will prosper,
[587.44 --> 592.54]  my Lord, and defend you.
[592.54 --> 596.72]  Surely His goodness and mercy
[596.72 --> 601.54]  shall dearly attend you.
[601.54 --> 608.54]  Honor in all, while the Almighty can do,
[608.54 --> 615.64]  as with His love He befriends you.
[615.64 --> 625.64]  Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him.
[625.64 --> 629.90]  All that has eyes and breath,
[629.90 --> 634.74]  come now with praises before Him.
[634.74 --> 642.74]  May the Almighty sound from His people again
[642.74 --> 650.74]  gladly forever adore Him.
[650.74 --> 674.84]  I saw the Lord, and He answered me,
[674.84 --> 683.94]  and deliver me from every fear.
[683.94 --> 690.44]  Those who look on Him are radiant,
[690.44 --> 695.54]  will never be ashamed,
[695.54 --> 699.54]  will never be ashamed.
[699.54 --> 703.54]  This poor man cried,
[703.54 --> 707.54]  and they lagered me,
[707.54 --> 715.54]  and saved me from my enemies.
[715.54 --> 720.64]  This Son of God,
[720.64 --> 724.64]  Surrounding saints,
[724.64 --> 728.64]  He will deliver them.
[728.64 --> 731.64]  He will deliver them.
[731.64 --> 739.64]  Magnify the Lord with me.
[739.64 --> 744.64]  Come and talk to His name,
[744.64 --> 749.74]  forever.
[749.74 --> 756.74]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[756.74 --> 760.74]  Come and talk to His name,
[760.74 --> 764.74]  forever.
[764.74 --> 767.74]  Oh, taste and see,
[767.74 --> 772.84]  Now the Lord is good.
[772.84 --> 776.84]  Oh, blessed is He,
[776.84 --> 779.84]  Who hides in Him.
[779.84 --> 783.84]  Oh, fear the Lord.
[783.84 --> 788.84]  Oh, all you saints,
[788.84 --> 793.94]  He will deliver them.
[793.94 --> 797.94]  You give you everything.
[797.94 --> 804.94]  Magnify the Lord with me.
[804.94 --> 811.94]  Come and talk to His name,
[811.94 --> 813.04]  forever.
[813.04 --> 817.04]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[817.04 --> 821.04]  Come and talk to His name,
[821.04 --> 822.04]  forever.
[822.04 --> 824.04]  Come and talk to His name,
[824.04 --> 825.04]  forever.
[825.04 --> 826.04]  Come and talk to His name,
[826.04 --> 828.04]  forever.
[828.04 --> 841.14]  Let us bless the Lord,
[841.14 --> 844.14]  Every day and night,
[844.14 --> 849.24]  Never-ending praise.
[849.24 --> 853.24]  May our incense rise.
[853.24 --> 856.24]  Let us bless the Lord,
[856.24 --> 860.24]  Every day and night,
[860.24 --> 862.34]  Never-ending praise.
[862.34 --> 864.34]  Never-ending praise.
[864.34 --> 868.34]  May our incense rise.
[868.34 --> 876.34]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[876.34 --> 880.34]  Come and talk to His name,
[880.34 --> 884.44]  Together.
[884.44 --> 892.44]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[892.44 --> 896.44]  Come and talk to His name,
[896.44 --> 901.44]  Forever.
[901.44 --> 927.54]  Who has command
[927.54 --> 931.64]  Who burns all the hosts of Heaven?
[931.64 --> 933.64]  Who else could make
[933.64 --> 937.64]  Every King bow down?
[937.64 --> 939.64]  Who else can whisper
[939.64 --> 943.64]  And darkness trembles?
[943.64 --> 950.64]  Holy and Holy God.
[950.64 --> 953.64]  What other beauty demands
[953.64 --> 956.64]  Such praises?
[956.64 --> 958.74]  What other splendor
[958.74 --> 960.74]  What other splendor
[960.74 --> 963.74]  What other majesty
[963.74 --> 965.74]  Rules with justice?
[965.74 --> 969.74]  Holy and Holy God.
[969.74 --> 974.74]  Come and behold Him,
[974.74 --> 976.74]  The one and the only
[976.74 --> 984.84]  Cry out.
[984.84 --> 986.84]  Sing holy,
[986.84 --> 987.84]  Forever.
[987.84 --> 989.84]  Holy God.
[989.84 --> 992.84]  Come and worship
[992.84 --> 995.56]  worship and holy God.
[1005.00 --> 1010.22]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[1011.58 --> 1015.84]  What other power can raise the dead?
[1015.84 --> 1021.84]  What other name remains undefeated?
[1022.84 --> 1026.70]  Only a holy God.
[1029.48 --> 1037.34]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1038.10 --> 1045.20]  Royals sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1045.20 --> 1049.32]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1052.84 --> 1064.90]  Who else could rescue me from my feelings?
[1064.90 --> 1070.08]  Who else would offer His only Son?
[1070.08 --> 1075.84]  Who else invites me to call Him Father?
[1075.84 --> 1081.48]  Only a holy God.
[1081.48 --> 1085.90]  Only my holy God.
[1085.90 --> 1095.96]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1095.96 --> 1103.82]  Royals sing holy, forever a holy God.

[1132.46 --> 1133.46]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1133.46 --> 1134.46]  Amen.
[1134.46 --> 1136.32]  You may be seated.
[1136.32 --> 1142.42]  What other word yapıl waves ilk times?
[1142.42 --> 1158.94]  Why I teach
[1158.94 --> 1163.52]  to be gracious to you, he rises to show you compassion.
[1163.52 --> 1165.72]  The Lord is God of justice.
[1165.72 --> 1167.54]  Blessed are all who wait for him.
[1169.02 --> 1171.06]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1174.66 --> 1177.52]  Holy and merciful God, in your presence
[1177.52 --> 1180.86]  we confess our sinfulness, our shortcomings,
[1180.86 --> 1182.46]  and our offenses against you.
[1183.56 --> 1186.04]  You alone know how often we have sinned
[1186.04 --> 1187.94]  in wandering from your ways,
[1187.94 --> 1191.62]  in wasting your gifts, in forgetting your love.
[1191.62 --> 1195.88]  Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we are ashamed and sorry
[1195.88 --> 1198.28]  for all we have done to displease you.
[1199.22 --> 1203.46]  Forgive our sins and help us to live in your light
[1203.46 --> 1206.86]  and walk in your ways for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[1206.86 --> 1208.66]  our Savior, amen.
[1210.46 --> 1213.90]  And our confidence as Christians is that in Christ
[1213.90 --> 1215.76]  we have forgiveness of sins.
[1215.76 --> 1217.74]  We're reminded of that this morning with these words
[1217.74 --> 1220.68]  from Romans 8 and Corinthians 5.
[1220.68 --> 1222.48]  Hear the good news.
[1222.48 --> 1225.08]  Who is in a position to condemn?
[1225.08 --> 1226.52]  Only Christ.
[1226.52 --> 1228.28]  And Christ died for us.
[1228.28 --> 1230.08]  Christ rose for us.
[1230.08 --> 1232.88]  Christ reigns in power for us.
[1232.88 --> 1235.16]  Christ prays for us.
[1235.16 --> 1239.36]  Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.
[1239.36 --> 1241.10]  The old life has gone.
[1241.10 --> 1242.10]  A new life has begun.
[1242.10 --> 1245.84]  Know that you are forgiven and be at peace.
[1245.84 --> 1249.04]  Let's celebrate our Lord by singing
[1249.04 --> 1250.88]  How Deep the Father's Love for Us.
[1250.88 --> 1254.34]  And after that, the children aged three through grade seven
[1254.34 --> 1256.78]  and anyone otherwise involved in the kids' life
[1256.78 --> 1258.28]  So, thank you, or welcome to leave.
[1258.28 --> 1259.24]  So, thank you for welcome to leave.
[1260.08 --> 1275.36]  Thanks, honey So opera
[1275.36 --> 1290.80]  deep the father's not for us how vast beyond all measure that he should give his only son
[1292.08 --> 1296.80]  to make a wretch his treasure
[1296.80 --> 1308.40]  how great the pain of searing loss the father turns his face away
[1308.40 --> 1319.52]  as wounds which mother chosen was bring many songs to glory
[1326.80 --> 1338.24]  Do not hold
[1344.32 --> 1347.28]  oh
[1347.28 --> 1355.00]  It was my sin that held him there
[1355.00 --> 1361.24]  Until it was accomplished
[1361.24 --> 1367.64]  His dying breath has brought me life
[1367.64 --> 1373.78]  I know that it is finished
[1377.28 --> 1386.30]  I will not boast in any game
[1386.30 --> 1390.96]  No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[1390.96 --> 1397.36]  But I will boast in Jesus' grace
[1397.36 --> 1401.94]  His death and resurrection
[1401.94 --> 1408.24]  Why should I get from His reward?
[1408.24 --> 1413.96]  I cannot give an answer
[1413.96 --> 1420.24]  But this I know with all my hope
[1420.24 --> 1425.96]  His wounds have made my rest
[1425.96 --> 1435.98]  I will not be able to get from His reward
[1435.98 --> 1438.98]  I will not be able to get from His reward
[1438.98 --> 1442.98]  I will not be able to get from His reward
[1442.98 --> 1458.26]  Our scripture reading this morning is from Psalm 134
[1458.26 --> 1460.48]  The Song of Ascent
[1460.48 --> 1464.84]  Praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord
[1464.84 --> 1468.20]  Who minister by night in the house of the Lord
[1468.20 --> 1471.42]  Lift up your hands in the sanctuary
[1471.42 --> 1473.52]  And praise the Lord
[1473.52 --> 1476.82]  May the Lord bless you from Zion
[1476.82 --> 1481.00]  He who is the maker of heaven and earth
[1481.00 --> 1483.76]  This is the word of the Lord
[1483.76 --> 1497.00]  Good morning
[1497.00 --> 1501.52]  Well friends, we have reached the end of the journey
[1501.52 --> 1502.72]  Did you know that?
[1503.80 --> 1505.16]  Psalm 134
[1505.16 --> 1509.20]  We've been in the series in the Psalms of Ascent
[1509.20 --> 1510.52]  For the last few months
[1510.52 --> 1514.88]  And today, literally and figuratively
[1514.88 --> 1516.70]  We have reached the summit
[1516.70 --> 1517.78]  We've ascended the mountain
[1517.78 --> 1518.72]  We are in the temple
[1518.72 --> 1520.64]  And we're worshiping the Lord
[1520.64 --> 1520.98]  Amen
[1520.98 --> 1524.68]  So if you remember, if you've been with us
[1524.68 --> 1527.74]  You will know that the Psalms of Ascent
[1527.74 --> 1529.56]  Are a collection of 15 psalms
[1529.56 --> 1530.60]  Psalms
[1530.60 --> 1532.94]  It's a test, ready?
[1533.64 --> 1534.76]  120 to
[1534.76 --> 1536.58]  134
[1536.58 --> 1537.64]  Good, that was an easy one
[1537.64 --> 1541.84]  And these are psalms that the Israelites would have sung
[1541.84 --> 1543.72]  On their way to Jerusalem
[1543.72 --> 1545.90]  For one of the annual festivals
[1545.90 --> 1548.58]  And for many of these pilgrims, right?
[1548.62 --> 1551.28]  They would have come from all over Jerusalem
[1551.28 --> 1552.58]  Even outside of Jerusalem
[1552.58 --> 1554.18]  They would have come from far and wide
[1554.18 --> 1558.98]  They would have faced a long, difficult journey
[1558.98 --> 1560.84]  A dangerous journey
[1560.84 --> 1562.86]  With many ups and downs
[1562.86 --> 1565.58]  Many peaks and valleys on the way
[1565.58 --> 1568.68]  And their destination was the temple
[1568.68 --> 1571.54]  They were going to worship God
[1571.54 --> 1572.96]  The temple was the place
[1572.96 --> 1575.46]  Where heaven and earth intersected
[1575.46 --> 1576.74]  The temple was the place
[1576.74 --> 1578.32]  Where God dwelt with his people
[1578.32 --> 1581.86]  And so that's the original context
[1581.86 --> 1584.96]  And setting for this collection of psalms
[1584.96 --> 1586.58]  But what is so beautiful about them
[1586.58 --> 1588.86]  What I love about these psalms
[1588.86 --> 1592.84]  Is that they are God's word to us as well
[1592.84 --> 1594.18]  Right?
[1594.28 --> 1596.30]  They're discipleship psalms
[1596.30 --> 1599.10]  That talk about life as a journey
[1599.10 --> 1600.72]  As we follow Jesus
[1600.72 --> 1604.10]  And so today, you know, we're going to look at Psalm 134
[1604.10 --> 1606.82]  And before we dive in, let's pray together
[1606.82 --> 1608.30]  Would you please pray with me?
[1610.94 --> 1611.76]  Father, we
[1611.76 --> 1614.76]  Have ascended
[1614.76 --> 1617.58]  Here this morning
[1617.58 --> 1619.80]  Lord, in our hearts
[1619.80 --> 1621.28]  Because you have called us
[1621.28 --> 1623.72]  And Lord, we come
[1623.72 --> 1625.44]  In your power
[1625.44 --> 1626.86]  In your grace
[1626.86 --> 1629.64]  Lord, seeking the peace
[1629.64 --> 1630.42]  That you provide
[1630.42 --> 1633.08]  And Lord, also seeking
[1633.08 --> 1634.82]  To meet with our Savior
[1634.82 --> 1636.24]  Would you
[1636.24 --> 1637.66]  Reveal to
[1637.66 --> 1639.62]  Reveal yourself to us
[1639.62 --> 1641.94]  In these words of Psalm 134
[1641.94 --> 1642.98]  These beautiful words
[1642.98 --> 1645.40]  And Lord, tune our hearts
[1645.40 --> 1647.04]  To see and hear from you
[1647.04 --> 1648.40]  We pray in Jesus' name
[1648.40 --> 1648.88]  Amen
[1648.88 --> 1651.90]  So friends, I want to start off
[1651.90 --> 1653.22]  With a question this morning
[1653.22 --> 1656.22]  What are some things
[1656.22 --> 1657.66]  That are really
[1657.66 --> 1659.54]  Quite amazing
[1659.54 --> 1661.62]  But that have become
[1661.62 --> 1662.80]  So commonplace
[1662.80 --> 1663.96]  That we take them for granted
[1663.96 --> 1666.92]  What are some things
[1666.92 --> 1668.54]  That are really quite amazing
[1668.54 --> 1669.64]  But that are so common
[1669.64 --> 1671.00]  That we've actually ceased
[1671.00 --> 1672.56]  To be amazed
[1672.56 --> 1673.52]  By them
[1673.52 --> 1677.08]  Well, I'll give you one
[1677.08 --> 1680.88]  Imagine a grandfather
[1680.88 --> 1682.24]  And a grandson
[1682.24 --> 1684.26]  Are in the kitchen together
[1684.26 --> 1686.08]  And someone asks them
[1686.08 --> 1687.66]  What's the greatest
[1687.66 --> 1690.06]  Modern convenience
[1690.06 --> 1691.92]  That's been added
[1691.92 --> 1694.08]  To the life of a cook
[1694.08 --> 1697.56]  And the young boy says
[1697.56 --> 1699.10]  The microwave
[1699.10 --> 1700.02]  Right?
[1700.24 --> 1701.06]  I want a snack
[1701.06 --> 1702.04]  I just pop it in there
[1702.04 --> 1702.44]  Done
[1702.44 --> 1704.80]  The grandfather says
[1704.80 --> 1706.58]  Running water
[1706.58 --> 1708.64]  Right?
[1708.68 --> 1709.38]  You see the difference
[1709.38 --> 1710.06]  In perspective
[1710.06 --> 1711.20]  Alright?
[1711.32 --> 1712.46]  Just think about it
[1712.46 --> 1714.04]  How many of us
[1714.04 --> 1715.04]  Got up this morning
[1715.04 --> 1717.12]  We stepped into the bathroom
[1717.12 --> 1718.34]  Turned on the shower
[1718.34 --> 1719.24]  And what?
[1720.46 --> 1721.40]  There's water
[1721.40 --> 1722.70]  Right?
[1723.28 --> 1724.96]  Or maybe I should ask
[1724.96 --> 1726.10]  How many of you
[1726.10 --> 1727.58]  Didn't do that this morning?
[1728.88 --> 1731.20]  Don't confess to your neighbor
[1731.20 --> 1734.02]  But just think about it
[1734.02 --> 1735.28]  Every morning in your house
[1735.28 --> 1736.58]  You just turn this little handle
[1736.58 --> 1737.44]  And what comes out?
[1738.40 --> 1738.84]  Water
[1738.84 --> 1739.86]  Right?
[1740.54 --> 1741.40]  Many people
[1741.40 --> 1742.90]  Even today on earth
[1742.90 --> 1744.06]  Don't have that
[1744.06 --> 1745.66]  Right?
[1745.72 --> 1746.28]  Do you realize
[1746.28 --> 1747.42]  That you have water
[1747.42 --> 1748.22]  In your house
[1748.22 --> 1749.46]  And it's clean
[1749.46 --> 1750.94]  Right?
[1750.98 --> 1751.92]  You can drink it
[1751.92 --> 1753.96]  And we even have what?
[1755.16 --> 1756.06]  Hot water
[1756.06 --> 1759.12]  It's a wonder
[1759.12 --> 1760.78]  That's so common now
[1760.78 --> 1762.98]  That we aren't even amazed
[1762.98 --> 1763.32]  By it
[1763.32 --> 1763.62]  Are we?
[1764.90 --> 1766.52]  Well so here's another question
[1766.52 --> 1766.92]  For you
[1766.92 --> 1769.02]  How long do you have
[1769.02 --> 1769.82]  To be a Christian?
[1770.88 --> 1771.02]  Right?
[1771.08 --> 1772.52]  How long do you have
[1772.52 --> 1773.48]  To go to church
[1773.48 --> 1775.16]  Before you lose
[1775.16 --> 1776.44]  The sense of wonder
[1776.44 --> 1778.24]  That you can worship God?
[1779.60 --> 1780.04]  Right?
[1780.06 --> 1781.16]  How long before we cease
[1781.16 --> 1781.96]  To be amazed
[1781.96 --> 1784.06]  At the splendor of God?
[1784.78 --> 1786.40]  The grace of God
[1786.40 --> 1787.26]  And his mercy
[1787.26 --> 1788.96]  His goodness
[1788.96 --> 1789.96]  And his greatness
[1789.96 --> 1790.74]  His holiness
[1790.74 --> 1791.66]  Right?
[1791.72 --> 1792.58]  Until that no longer
[1792.58 --> 1793.64]  Thrills you
[1793.64 --> 1794.90]  Right?
[1794.94 --> 1795.78]  In fact you hardly
[1795.78 --> 1796.88]  Recognize
[1796.88 --> 1798.28]  God
[1798.28 --> 1800.70]  And worship of God
[1800.70 --> 1801.80]  As a wonder
[1801.80 --> 1802.38]  Anymore
[1802.38 --> 1804.52]  But worship
[1804.52 --> 1805.98]  What we're doing here
[1805.98 --> 1806.50]  This morning
[1806.50 --> 1808.14]  Is a weekly invitation
[1808.14 --> 1811.82]  To tremble afresh
[1811.82 --> 1812.82]  At
[1812.82 --> 1814.18]  The glory
[1814.18 --> 1814.94]  Of our God
[1814.94 --> 1816.26]  At who
[1816.26 --> 1817.74]  Our God is
[1817.74 --> 1818.52]  And what he
[1818.52 --> 1819.44]  Is doing
[1819.44 --> 1820.22]  In this world
[1820.22 --> 1821.40]  Friends
[1821.40 --> 1821.96]  And that's what
[1821.96 --> 1823.24]  Psalm 134
[1823.24 --> 1824.76]  Is as well
[1824.76 --> 1825.70]  Is an invitation
[1825.70 --> 1826.50]  To us
[1826.50 --> 1827.38]  Is an invitation
[1827.38 --> 1828.12]  To us
[1828.12 --> 1829.26]  Of a life
[1829.26 --> 1831.36]  Of amazement
[1831.36 --> 1831.82]  Of God
[1831.82 --> 1832.34]  In other words
[1832.34 --> 1833.16]  A life of praise
[1833.16 --> 1834.02]  A life of worship
[1834.02 --> 1836.46]  So it's an invitation
[1836.46 --> 1837.66]  To be amazed again
[1837.66 --> 1838.40]  At God
[1838.40 --> 1839.42]  And that
[1839.42 --> 1840.66]  We can worship him
[1840.66 --> 1843.32]  So Psalm 134
[1843.32 --> 1844.48]  Was most likely sung
[1844.48 --> 1845.46]  At the end
[1845.46 --> 1846.68]  Of the worship service
[1846.68 --> 1847.24]  In the temple
[1847.24 --> 1849.66]  So as the pilgrims
[1849.66 --> 1851.32]  Were there for the festivities
[1851.32 --> 1852.58]  They've been worshiping
[1852.58 --> 1854.04]  For many days
[1854.04 --> 1854.92]  Often these festivals
[1854.92 --> 1855.98]  Would go on for days
[1855.98 --> 1857.72]  They're preparing
[1857.72 --> 1858.78]  To go back home
[1858.78 --> 1860.04]  And scholars
[1860.04 --> 1860.96]  And commentaries
[1860.96 --> 1862.92]  Think that this was
[1862.92 --> 1864.74]  Probably the last thing
[1864.74 --> 1865.96]  That they would have sung
[1865.96 --> 1868.70]  And so they would sing
[1868.70 --> 1869.94]  And they would hear
[1869.94 --> 1871.22]  In this chorus
[1871.22 --> 1872.66]  That says
[1872.66 --> 1874.26]  Praise the Lord
[1874.26 --> 1876.04]  Praise the Lord
[1876.04 --> 1877.86]  God bless you
[1877.86 --> 1878.72]  Right
[1878.72 --> 1879.08]  We can
[1879.08 --> 1880.02]  I put the
[1880.02 --> 1880.98]  The words there
[1880.98 --> 1882.26]  On the screen for us
[1882.26 --> 1883.32]  And though
[1883.32 --> 1884.00]  That's the
[1884.00 --> 1885.78]  The song
[1885.78 --> 1886.48]  The refrain
[1886.48 --> 1887.24]  It's very short
[1887.24 --> 1888.04]  But it's the song
[1888.04 --> 1889.02]  That they would have
[1889.02 --> 1890.56]  On their lips
[1890.56 --> 1891.46]  As they leave
[1891.46 --> 1892.90]  Resounding in their heart
[1892.92 --> 1894.98]  Singing to one another
[1894.98 --> 1896.14]  On their journey
[1896.14 --> 1896.64]  Back home
[1896.64 --> 1897.14]  The Lord
[1897.14 --> 1898.56]  Praise the Lord
[1898.56 --> 1899.60]  Praise the Lord
[1899.60 --> 1900.38]  The Lord bless you
[1900.38 --> 1902.50]  I want to invite you
[1902.50 --> 1902.98]  To say it
[1902.98 --> 1903.64]  With me right now
[1903.64 --> 1904.20]  Maybe turn
[1904.20 --> 1905.54]  To the person
[1905.54 --> 1906.20]  Next to you
[1906.20 --> 1907.54]  And let's say this
[1907.54 --> 1908.68]  Praise the Lord
[1908.68 --> 1910.28]  Praise the Lord
[1910.28 --> 1911.80]  The Lord bless you
[1911.80 --> 1914.50]  So this morning
[1914.50 --> 1915.14]  I just want to look
[1915.14 --> 1916.18]  At these two things
[1916.18 --> 1917.36]  Praise and blessing
[1917.36 --> 1918.12]  Okay
[1918.12 --> 1918.88]  Praise and blessing
[1918.88 --> 1920.34]  And how this psalm
[1920.34 --> 1921.32]  Invites us
[1921.32 --> 1923.76]  Into both of those things
[1923.76 --> 1926.06]  As we take this journey
[1926.06 --> 1926.66]  Of faith
[1926.66 --> 1927.78]  That we are on
[1927.78 --> 1929.02]  A life of praise
[1929.02 --> 1929.78]  And a life of blessing
[1929.78 --> 1930.70]  So first
[1930.70 --> 1931.36]  Those two points
[1931.36 --> 1932.32]  First the invitation
[1932.32 --> 1932.94]  To worship
[1932.94 --> 1933.66]  Excuse me
[1933.66 --> 1934.10]  To worship
[1934.10 --> 1935.68]  The invitation to worship
[1935.68 --> 1936.76]  We are called
[1936.76 --> 1937.58]  To praise God
[1937.58 --> 1939.00]  And here
[1939.00 --> 1939.78]  It mentions it
[1939.78 --> 1940.56]  Two times
[1940.56 --> 1941.62]  In our verses
[1941.62 --> 1942.56]  So you can see
[1942.56 --> 1943.22]  In verse one
[1943.22 --> 1944.46]  We'll have it there
[1944.46 --> 1945.56]  Praise the Lord
[1945.56 --> 1946.58]  All you servants
[1946.58 --> 1947.20]  Of the Lord
[1947.20 --> 1948.96]  And then in verse two
[1948.96 --> 1950.10]  Lift up your hands
[1950.10 --> 1951.08]  In the sanctuary
[1951.08 --> 1952.66]  And praise the Lord
[1952.66 --> 1954.46]  What does it mean
[1954.46 --> 1955.22]  To praise the Lord
[1955.22 --> 1956.30]  It means
[1956.30 --> 1957.56]  With our words
[1957.56 --> 1958.94]  And with our deeds
[1958.94 --> 1960.06]  We're testifying
[1960.06 --> 1961.46]  To the goodness of God
[1961.46 --> 1964.06]  And so when we praise God
[1964.06 --> 1965.22]  Another way of saying that
[1965.22 --> 1966.96]  It's to acknowledge God
[1966.96 --> 1967.98]  For who he is
[1967.98 --> 1969.18]  And what he has done for us
[1969.18 --> 1970.74]  And I want us
[1970.74 --> 1971.42]  To just notice
[1971.42 --> 1972.58]  A couple things
[1972.58 --> 1974.32]  About praising the Lord
[1974.32 --> 1975.72]  From Psalm 134
[1975.72 --> 1977.30]  First notice that
[1977.30 --> 1978.78]  It is an invitation
[1978.78 --> 1981.44]  And it's an invitation
[1981.44 --> 1983.84]  For right now
[1983.84 --> 1985.50]  Praise the Lord
[1985.50 --> 1987.56]  It's not an invitation
[1987.56 --> 1989.22]  For a future date
[1989.22 --> 1991.08]  When you feel like
[1991.08 --> 1991.98]  Praising the Lord
[1991.98 --> 1993.38]  But it's an invitation
[1993.38 --> 1994.16]  For right now
[1994.16 --> 1995.64]  And so friends
[1995.64 --> 1996.14]  That means that
[1996.14 --> 1997.20]  Whatever you are
[1997.20 --> 1998.08]  Going through
[1998.08 --> 2000.32]  Even if life is difficult
[2000.32 --> 2001.64]  Even if you feel like
[2001.64 --> 2002.72]  You are in a valley
[2002.72 --> 2004.96]  Even if your mind
[2004.96 --> 2005.76]  Is elsewhere
[2005.76 --> 2006.62]  And your heart
[2006.62 --> 2007.26]  Is burned
[2007.26 --> 2009.18]  Right now
[2009.18 --> 2010.54]  Is the time
[2010.54 --> 2011.54]  To praise the Lord
[2011.54 --> 2013.78]  Now all along
[2013.78 --> 2014.42]  In this series
[2014.42 --> 2015.46]  I've been reading
[2015.46 --> 2016.44]  And sharing with you
[2016.44 --> 2017.08]  Passages
[2017.08 --> 2018.36]  From this book
[2018.36 --> 2019.36]  By Eugene Peterson
[2019.36 --> 2020.60]  Called A Long Obedience
[2020.60 --> 2021.40]  In the Same Direction
[2021.40 --> 2022.22]  It's his commentary
[2022.22 --> 2023.54]  On the Psalms of Ascent
[2023.54 --> 2025.56]  And what I so appreciate
[2025.56 --> 2027.30]  About the book
[2027.30 --> 2028.60]  And Eugene Peterson's writing
[2028.60 --> 2030.04]  Is he has these
[2030.04 --> 2031.30]  Vivid illustrations
[2031.30 --> 2033.00]  That really just bring
[2033.00 --> 2034.34]  The Psalm to life
[2034.34 --> 2035.52]  And it speaks to our
[2035.52 --> 2036.28]  Everyday lives
[2036.28 --> 2037.74]  So I want to share
[2037.74 --> 2038.56]  With you what he said
[2038.56 --> 2039.66]  About this invitation
[2039.66 --> 2040.18]  To worship
[2040.18 --> 2041.76]  Now keep in mind
[2041.76 --> 2042.70]  That God's people
[2042.70 --> 2043.76]  Are making their way
[2043.76 --> 2044.46]  To Jerusalem
[2044.46 --> 2046.80]  To come to the temple
[2046.80 --> 2047.52]  To worship God
[2047.52 --> 2048.24]  And so in light
[2048.24 --> 2049.34]  Of that invitation
[2049.34 --> 2050.86]  By the Lord
[2050.86 --> 2051.28]  To worship
[2051.28 --> 2052.10]  Here's what it says
[2052.10 --> 2054.66]  Come and join in
[2054.66 --> 2056.36]  Don't be shy
[2056.36 --> 2058.16]  Don't hold back
[2058.16 --> 2060.02]  Did you have a fight
[2060.02 --> 2060.72]  With your spouse
[2060.72 --> 2061.28]  On the way
[2061.28 --> 2063.34]  You are here now
[2063.34 --> 2064.58]  Bless God
[2064.58 --> 2066.50]  Did you quarrel
[2066.50 --> 2067.20]  With your neighbor
[2067.20 --> 2068.64]  While making the trip
[2068.64 --> 2070.62]  You are here now
[2070.62 --> 2071.68]  Bless God
[2071.68 --> 2074.22]  Did you lose touch
[2074.22 --> 2075.80]  With your children
[2075.80 --> 2076.58]  While coming
[2076.58 --> 2077.84]  And aren't sure
[2077.84 --> 2078.64]  Where they are now
[2078.64 --> 2080.10]  Put that aside
[2080.10 --> 2080.64]  For a moment
[2080.64 --> 2082.34]  They have their own
[2082.34 --> 2083.26]  Pilgrimage to make
[2083.26 --> 2085.12]  You are here now
[2085.12 --> 2086.34]  Bless God
[2086.34 --> 2089.02]  Are you ashamed
[2089.02 --> 2089.72]  Of the feelings
[2089.72 --> 2090.26]  You had
[2090.26 --> 2091.06]  While traveling
[2091.06 --> 2092.56]  The grumbling
[2092.56 --> 2093.48]  You indulged in
[2093.48 --> 2094.76]  The resentment
[2094.76 --> 2095.66]  You harbored
[2095.66 --> 2097.40]  You are here now
[2097.40 --> 2098.32]  Bless God
[2098.32 --> 2100.12]  Are you embarrassed
[2100.12 --> 2100.70]  At the number
[2100.70 --> 2101.30]  Of times
[2101.30 --> 2102.44]  You quit
[2102.44 --> 2103.02]  And had
[2103.02 --> 2103.86]  To have someone
[2103.86 --> 2104.70]  Pick you up
[2104.70 --> 2105.84]  And carry you along
[2105.84 --> 2107.24]  No matter
[2107.24 --> 2108.26]  You are here
[2108.26 --> 2109.78]  Bless God
[2109.78 --> 2112.08]  Right
[2112.08 --> 2113.22]  And you know
[2113.22 --> 2114.08]  I so resonate
[2114.08 --> 2114.66]  With that
[2114.66 --> 2116.30]  Because there are
[2116.30 --> 2117.14]  Times in this
[2117.14 --> 2118.40]  Journey of faith
[2118.40 --> 2120.28]  When we have
[2120.28 --> 2121.60]  Negative emotions
[2121.60 --> 2122.46]  Right
[2122.46 --> 2123.60]  When we fight
[2123.60 --> 2125.22]  With our family
[2125.22 --> 2125.62]  Members
[2125.62 --> 2126.34]  And our neighbors
[2126.34 --> 2128.82]  When we feel
[2128.82 --> 2129.16]  Like we have
[2129.16 --> 2130.24]  Let ourselves down
[2130.24 --> 2132.60]  When we sometimes
[2132.60 --> 2133.26]  Just don't have
[2133.26 --> 2134.80]  Excitement for things
[2134.80 --> 2136.14]  In the Christian faith
[2136.14 --> 2137.40]  You know
[2137.40 --> 2137.86]  Maybe
[2137.86 --> 2139.04]  When somebody
[2139.04 --> 2140.06]  Needs to come
[2140.06 --> 2140.96]  And pick us up
[2140.96 --> 2142.92]  But in the midst
[2142.92 --> 2143.82]  Of all of that
[2143.82 --> 2144.74]  The psalm is saying
[2144.74 --> 2146.34]  No matter
[2146.34 --> 2147.64]  We are to praise God
[2147.64 --> 2148.58]  Right
[2148.58 --> 2149.04]  We're invited
[2149.04 --> 2149.58]  To do
[2149.58 --> 2150.46]  What we were
[2150.46 --> 2151.36]  Created
[2151.36 --> 2152.12]  And redeemed
[2152.12 --> 2152.80]  To do
[2152.80 --> 2153.72]  Which is to
[2153.72 --> 2154.76]  Center our lives
[2154.76 --> 2155.28]  On God
[2155.28 --> 2156.54]  And to praise him
[2156.54 --> 2157.26]  For who he is
[2157.26 --> 2157.98]  And what he has done
[2157.98 --> 2160.00]  No matter
[2160.00 --> 2161.52]  And friends
[2161.52 --> 2162.20]  That's an invitation
[2162.20 --> 2163.38]  To us as well
[2163.38 --> 2164.10]  Right
[2164.10 --> 2164.98]  To bring our whole
[2164.98 --> 2166.06]  Selves before God
[2166.06 --> 2167.02]  You know
[2167.02 --> 2167.56]  Whether we're
[2167.56 --> 2168.24]  Dragging ourselves
[2168.24 --> 2168.80]  Up the mountain
[2168.80 --> 2169.58]  To Jerusalem
[2169.58 --> 2170.82]  Whether we are
[2170.82 --> 2171.54]  Dragging ourselves
[2171.54 --> 2172.28]  Out of bed
[2172.28 --> 2173.96]  To church
[2173.96 --> 2174.96]  This morning
[2174.96 --> 2176.12]  And you know
[2176.12 --> 2176.90]  And we come here
[2176.90 --> 2177.78]  We don't arrive
[2177.78 --> 2179.06]  Often very polished
[2179.06 --> 2179.82]  Or put together
[2179.82 --> 2182.60]  We come tired
[2182.60 --> 2183.26]  And weary
[2183.26 --> 2184.58]  We come stressed
[2184.58 --> 2185.64]  Out and anxious
[2185.64 --> 2186.96]  Sinful
[2186.96 --> 2188.08]  And sorrowful
[2188.08 --> 2189.98]  But no matter
[2189.98 --> 2191.56]  Praise the Lord
[2191.56 --> 2193.28]  He calls us
[2193.28 --> 2193.80]  And invites us
[2193.80 --> 2194.42]  To praise him
[2194.42 --> 2196.04]  And so we are
[2196.04 --> 2196.74]  Invited to praise
[2196.74 --> 2197.12]  The Lord
[2197.12 --> 2197.94]  But the second thing
[2197.94 --> 2198.60]  We see here
[2198.60 --> 2198.94]  Is that we're
[2198.94 --> 2199.82]  To praise the Lord
[2199.82 --> 2200.96]  Even when we
[2200.96 --> 2202.72]  Don't feel like it
[2202.72 --> 2204.94]  We're to praise
[2204.94 --> 2205.34]  The Lord
[2205.34 --> 2206.30]  Even when our
[2206.30 --> 2206.86]  Heart
[2206.86 --> 2208.36]  And our feelings
[2208.36 --> 2210.22]  Just aren't
[2210.22 --> 2210.94]  There
[2210.94 --> 2212.54]  You know
[2212.54 --> 2213.58]  Because let's be honest
[2213.58 --> 2214.76]  Some days
[2214.76 --> 2215.74]  Are better than others
[2215.74 --> 2215.98]  Right
[2215.98 --> 2217.60]  Some days
[2217.60 --> 2218.76]  I don't feel
[2218.76 --> 2219.94]  Like worshiping
[2219.94 --> 2220.58]  The Lord
[2220.58 --> 2222.66]  And so some people
[2222.66 --> 2223.16]  Might say
[2223.16 --> 2223.40]  Look
[2223.40 --> 2225.04]  I can't praise God
[2225.04 --> 2226.68]  If I don't feel
[2226.68 --> 2227.18]  Like it
[2227.18 --> 2228.46]  Like they might
[2228.46 --> 2228.70]  You know
[2228.70 --> 2229.18]  We might say
[2229.18 --> 2230.06]  Wouldn't that be
[2230.06 --> 2231.60]  Kind of dishonest
[2231.60 --> 2232.24]  Wouldn't that be
[2232.24 --> 2233.52]  Kind of disingenuous
[2233.52 --> 2234.92]  Maybe inauthentic
[2234.92 --> 2237.80]  I would rather wait
[2237.80 --> 2239.50]  And praise God
[2239.50 --> 2240.64]  When I feel like it
[2240.64 --> 2242.42]  And so what's the response
[2242.42 --> 2243.16]  Of this psalm
[2243.16 --> 2244.98]  It's in verse 2
[2244.98 --> 2246.30]  It says
[2246.30 --> 2247.72]  Lift up your hands
[2247.72 --> 2248.50]  In the sanctuary
[2248.50 --> 2250.10]  And praise the Lord
[2250.10 --> 2252.00]  Now
[2252.00 --> 2253.60]  Sometimes in worship
[2253.60 --> 2256.44]  We lift our hands
[2256.44 --> 2257.62]  Well maybe we don't
[2257.62 --> 2258.08]  As much
[2258.08 --> 2259.26]  I acknowledge that
[2259.26 --> 2260.32]  We're going to work
[2260.32 --> 2260.78]  On this
[2260.78 --> 2263.20]  We lift our hands
[2263.20 --> 2264.00]  Why?
[2265.00 --> 2266.12]  Because our heart
[2266.12 --> 2267.00]  Is impacted
[2267.00 --> 2268.12]  Right
[2268.12 --> 2268.88]  We get
[2268.88 --> 2269.86]  We catch a glimpse
[2269.86 --> 2270.66]  Of God's glory
[2270.66 --> 2272.74]  Our hearts are moved
[2272.74 --> 2274.76]  By the truth
[2274.76 --> 2275.46]  Of the word
[2275.46 --> 2276.80]  By the glory
[2276.80 --> 2277.98]  Of God
[2277.98 --> 2279.04]  We feel it
[2279.04 --> 2279.68]  And as a result
[2279.68 --> 2280.76]  We want to express
[2280.76 --> 2281.64]  How we feel
[2281.64 --> 2283.00]  So we raise our hands
[2283.00 --> 2284.00]  And even if we don't
[2284.00 --> 2284.44]  Raise our hands
[2284.44 --> 2285.68]  We praise God
[2285.68 --> 2286.66]  From our hearts
[2286.66 --> 2287.48]  We're expressing
[2287.48 --> 2289.34]  Our worship to God
[2289.34 --> 2292.14]  And maybe when we do so
[2292.14 --> 2293.04]  We lift our hands
[2293.04 --> 2295.20]  But what do you do
[2295.20 --> 2295.68]  If your heart
[2295.68 --> 2296.90]  Is not engaged?
[2298.50 --> 2299.52]  What the psalm says
[2299.52 --> 2301.08]  Is you still lift your hands
[2301.08 --> 2303.00]  Because God made us
[2303.00 --> 2303.74]  In such a way
[2303.74 --> 2304.36]  Right
[2304.36 --> 2305.40]  There's no dualism here
[2305.40 --> 2306.46]  We are a created
[2306.46 --> 2307.42]  Human beings
[2307.42 --> 2308.98]  Body and soul
[2308.98 --> 2310.36]  That there's no separation
[2310.36 --> 2311.56]  Between those two things
[2311.56 --> 2312.48]  And that means
[2312.48 --> 2313.88]  That if your heart
[2313.88 --> 2315.20]  Is not feeling
[2315.20 --> 2316.24]  Praise to God
[2316.24 --> 2317.18]  What the psalm says
[2317.18 --> 2318.58]  Is lift up your hands
[2318.58 --> 2320.42]  And just maybe
[2320.42 --> 2321.74]  Your heart
[2321.74 --> 2323.00]  Will get the message
[2323.00 --> 2324.32]  And your heart
[2324.32 --> 2325.42]  Will come along
[2325.42 --> 2327.08]  And praise God
[2327.08 --> 2329.22]  So John Calvin
[2329.22 --> 2330.06]  Put it this way
[2330.06 --> 2332.98]  He says
[2332.98 --> 2334.54]  Why do men lift their hands
[2334.54 --> 2335.16]  When they pray?
[2336.14 --> 2336.96]  Is it not
[2336.96 --> 2338.18]  That their hearts
[2338.18 --> 2339.10]  May be raised
[2339.10 --> 2340.40]  At the same time
[2340.40 --> 2340.88]  To God?
[2342.00 --> 2342.22]  Right
[2342.22 --> 2342.90]  You see what he's saying?
[2342.96 --> 2344.26]  We lift up our hearts
[2344.26 --> 2346.14]  In a sense
[2346.14 --> 2347.46]  Go through the motions
[2347.46 --> 2349.76]  Whether you feel like it or not
[2349.76 --> 2350.56]  Because God is worthy
[2350.56 --> 2351.00]  Of our praise
[2351.00 --> 2351.98]  And as we do so
[2351.98 --> 2352.70]  And we put our place
[2352.70 --> 2353.72]  In the way of worship
[2353.72 --> 2356.20]  Our hearts will follow
[2356.20 --> 2359.20]  It's much easier
[2359.20 --> 2359.88]  To lift up our hands
[2359.88 --> 2360.58]  It's just emotion
[2360.58 --> 2360.86]  Right?
[2361.82 --> 2362.92]  Our hearts are a lot
[2362.92 --> 2363.64]  More stubborn
[2363.64 --> 2365.80]  But they will follow
[2365.80 --> 2368.14]  So instead of saying
[2368.14 --> 2368.42]  You know
[2368.42 --> 2369.42]  I don't feel like
[2369.42 --> 2370.08]  Worshiping
[2370.08 --> 2370.58]  Therefore
[2370.58 --> 2371.06]  I'm just
[2371.06 --> 2371.64]  I'm not going to go
[2371.64 --> 2372.46]  To church today
[2372.46 --> 2374.72]  What instead
[2374.72 --> 2375.36]  What we need to tell
[2375.36 --> 2375.80]  Ourselves is
[2375.80 --> 2376.84]  I don't feel like
[2376.84 --> 2377.66]  Worshiping
[2377.66 --> 2378.84]  Therefore
[2378.84 --> 2379.14]  Therefore
[2379.14 --> 2380.64]  I have to go
[2380.64 --> 2381.40]  To church today
[2381.40 --> 2382.64]  Right?
[2382.68 --> 2383.84]  I need to put myself
[2383.84 --> 2385.16]  In the place
[2385.16 --> 2385.76]  Of worship
[2385.76 --> 2387.78]  And in the process
[2387.78 --> 2389.56]  I will be blessed
[2389.56 --> 2390.12]  By God
[2390.12 --> 2391.36]  And I will
[2391.36 --> 2392.42]  Respond to him
[2392.42 --> 2392.88]  In worship
[2392.88 --> 2394.42]  Okay
[2394.42 --> 2395.18]  So we are invited
[2395.18 --> 2396.66]  To praise God
[2396.66 --> 2397.36]  Even when we don't
[2397.36 --> 2398.10]  Feel like it
[2398.10 --> 2400.14]  But even with
[2400.14 --> 2400.92]  That invitation
[2400.92 --> 2402.06]  You know
[2402.06 --> 2402.80]  We still struggle
[2402.80 --> 2403.42]  To praise God
[2403.42 --> 2404.34]  Some days
[2404.34 --> 2405.46]  We feel
[2405.46 --> 2406.68]  Far away
[2406.68 --> 2407.88]  From God's presence
[2407.88 --> 2409.92]  But friends
[2409.92 --> 2410.98]  There is good news
[2410.98 --> 2412.10]  In this passage
[2412.10 --> 2412.84]  For us this morning
[2412.84 --> 2413.82]  And I want us
[2413.82 --> 2414.46]  To see this
[2414.46 --> 2416.06]  That even when
[2416.06 --> 2416.72]  We struggle
[2416.72 --> 2417.38]  To praise God
[2417.38 --> 2417.92]  That there is
[2417.92 --> 2418.72]  Someone praising
[2418.72 --> 2419.64]  God for us
[2419.64 --> 2421.04]  So look with me
[2421.04 --> 2421.68]  At verse 1
[2421.68 --> 2422.60]  Let's see what it says
[2422.60 --> 2423.52]  It says
[2423.52 --> 2424.50]  Praise the Lord
[2424.50 --> 2425.28]  Who?
[2426.18 --> 2427.18]  All you servants
[2427.18 --> 2428.02]  Of the Lord
[2428.02 --> 2429.04]  Who minister
[2429.04 --> 2430.62]  By night
[2430.62 --> 2431.80]  In the house
[2431.80 --> 2432.28]  Of the Lord
[2432.28 --> 2433.38]  Right
[2433.38 --> 2433.94]  The servants
[2433.94 --> 2434.48]  Of the Lord
[2434.48 --> 2434.84]  There
[2434.84 --> 2436.10]  Is talking about
[2436.10 --> 2436.70]  The Levites
[2436.70 --> 2437.42]  The priests
[2437.42 --> 2438.42]  Of the temple
[2438.42 --> 2439.30]  They were the worship
[2439.30 --> 2440.30]  Leaders in Jerusalem
[2440.30 --> 2442.34]  And what they would do
[2442.34 --> 2443.00]  Is they would work
[2443.00 --> 2443.76]  In shifts
[2443.76 --> 2445.92]  Around the clock
[2445.92 --> 2447.52]  Day and night
[2447.52 --> 2448.36]  24-7
[2448.36 --> 2449.02]  So imagine that
[2449.02 --> 2450.28]  Even at 3 a.m.
[2450.40 --> 2451.62]  When all the people
[2451.62 --> 2452.30]  Are sleeping
[2452.30 --> 2453.98]  There is someone
[2453.98 --> 2455.26]  In the temple
[2455.26 --> 2457.46]  Praising God
[2457.46 --> 2459.90]  Actively engaged
[2459.90 --> 2460.20]  In worship
[2460.20 --> 2460.76]  Not just kind of
[2460.76 --> 2461.22]  Standing there
[2461.22 --> 2461.94]  Like the night guard
[2461.94 --> 2462.52]  At the museum
[2462.52 --> 2463.10]  Just kind of
[2463.10 --> 2464.14]  Checking things out
[2464.14 --> 2464.74]  Everything's cool
[2464.74 --> 2466.66]  But actively engaged
[2466.66 --> 2467.54]  In praising God
[2467.54 --> 2470.16]  Someone was there
[2470.16 --> 2470.74]  In the temple
[2470.74 --> 2471.44]  Praising God
[2471.44 --> 2472.14]  On behalf
[2472.14 --> 2473.20]  Of the people
[2473.20 --> 2474.82]  And so here's
[2474.82 --> 2475.38]  What this meant
[2475.38 --> 2476.52]  For these original
[2476.52 --> 2477.12]  Pilgrims
[2477.12 --> 2477.84]  On the journey
[2477.84 --> 2479.34]  They had made
[2479.34 --> 2479.98]  This journey
[2479.98 --> 2481.10]  Perhaps once a year
[2481.10 --> 2482.86]  They made it
[2482.86 --> 2483.94]  Through all the dangers
[2483.94 --> 2485.50]  To be there
[2485.50 --> 2486.68]  And once
[2486.68 --> 2488.42]  They get there
[2488.42 --> 2489.24]  They've completed
[2489.24 --> 2490.24]  Their time of worship
[2490.24 --> 2491.74]  And what would they do
[2491.74 --> 2492.14]  Well they would
[2492.14 --> 2492.92]  Leave
[2492.92 --> 2493.96]  They would go back home
[2493.96 --> 2494.50]  They would leave
[2494.50 --> 2494.92]  The temple
[2494.92 --> 2496.56]  And it must have
[2496.56 --> 2497.38]  Crossed their minds
[2497.38 --> 2498.52]  That they will not
[2498.52 --> 2499.34]  Be able to worship
[2499.34 --> 2500.38]  In the temple again
[2500.38 --> 2502.00]  Until next time
[2502.00 --> 2504.48]  Maybe next year
[2504.48 --> 2506.22]  Maybe even longer
[2506.22 --> 2506.88]  Who knows
[2506.88 --> 2509.80]  But as they depart
[2509.80 --> 2511.20]  What consolation
[2511.20 --> 2512.50]  Would they have
[2512.50 --> 2514.42]  To carry with them
[2514.42 --> 2515.04]  As they go
[2515.04 --> 2516.20]  They would leave
[2516.20 --> 2517.30]  Knowing that the priests
[2517.30 --> 2518.58]  Would remain behind
[2518.58 --> 2520.20]  The priests
[2520.20 --> 2522.18]  Would represent them
[2522.18 --> 2523.32]  In the temple
[2523.32 --> 2524.72]  And so the people
[2524.72 --> 2525.32]  Left knowing
[2525.32 --> 2526.04]  That the worship
[2526.04 --> 2527.14]  That they participated
[2527.14 --> 2528.20]  In in the temple
[2528.20 --> 2530.16]  Would continue on
[2530.16 --> 2531.32]  Around the clock
[2531.32 --> 2532.84]  Right
[2532.84 --> 2534.16]  Day and night
[2534.16 --> 2536.52]  They have
[2536.52 --> 2537.44]  A representative
[2537.44 --> 2538.32]  In the temple
[2538.32 --> 2539.68]  And friends
[2539.68 --> 2540.62]  The good news for us
[2540.62 --> 2541.68]  Is that we
[2541.68 --> 2542.90]  Have a representative
[2542.90 --> 2543.74]  In the temple too
[2543.74 --> 2544.10]  Don't we
[2544.10 --> 2545.16]  Do you know
[2545.16 --> 2546.32]  That right now
[2546.32 --> 2548.58]  Jesus is doing
[2548.58 --> 2549.24]  That for you
[2549.24 --> 2550.96]  Right at this
[2550.96 --> 2551.66]  Very moment
[2551.66 --> 2552.58]  Right now
[2552.58 --> 2554.72]  Jesus
[2554.72 --> 2556.64]  Is doing that
[2556.64 --> 2556.98]  He
[2556.98 --> 2557.68]  Where is he
[2557.68 --> 2558.90]  He is ascended
[2558.90 --> 2559.40]  Into heaven
[2559.40 --> 2559.94]  He is standing
[2559.94 --> 2560.92]  At the right hand
[2560.92 --> 2561.66]  Of the father
[2561.66 --> 2563.88]  In perfect fellowship
[2563.88 --> 2564.50]  With God
[2564.50 --> 2565.26]  And he is standing
[2565.26 --> 2565.90]  There representing
[2566.46 --> 2568.16]  You before God
[2568.16 --> 2569.16]  He says
[2569.16 --> 2569.42]  You know
[2569.42 --> 2570.60]  This man
[2570.60 --> 2571.06]  This woman
[2571.06 --> 2571.86]  This child
[2571.86 --> 2573.30]  I died for them
[2573.30 --> 2574.36]  I rose for them
[2574.36 --> 2575.58]  They belong
[2575.58 --> 2576.86]  To me
[2576.86 --> 2578.06]  They are ours
[2578.06 --> 2581.70]  Here's what we're told
[2581.70 --> 2583.02]  In Hebrews chapter 7
[2583.02 --> 2584.88]  It gives us a picture
[2584.88 --> 2585.62]  Of this
[2585.62 --> 2586.54]  It says
[2586.54 --> 2587.52]  Now there have been
[2587.52 --> 2588.82]  Many of those priests
[2588.82 --> 2589.84]  Right
[2589.84 --> 2590.62]  This is the Old Testament
[2590.62 --> 2591.10]  Priests
[2591.10 --> 2593.10]  Since death
[2593.10 --> 2594.70]  Prevented them
[2594.70 --> 2595.54]  From continuing
[2595.54 --> 2596.32]  In office
[2596.32 --> 2597.50]  But because
[2597.50 --> 2598.72]  Jesus lives forever
[2598.72 --> 2599.82]  He has a permanent
[2599.82 --> 2600.58]  Priesthood
[2600.58 --> 2601.64]  Therefore
[2601.64 --> 2602.38]  He is able
[2602.38 --> 2603.48]  To save completely
[2603.48 --> 2604.36]  Those who come
[2604.36 --> 2604.94]  To God
[2604.94 --> 2606.38]  Through him
[2606.38 --> 2608.26]  Because he always
[2608.26 --> 2609.40]  Lives to do what
[2609.40 --> 2611.42]  Intercede
[2611.42 --> 2611.98]  For them
[2611.98 --> 2614.06]  Friends
[2614.06 --> 2615.60]  Jesus is interceding
[2615.60 --> 2616.18]  For you
[2616.18 --> 2617.58]  Right
[2617.58 --> 2618.48]  Even when
[2618.48 --> 2620.10]  You struggle
[2620.10 --> 2621.06]  To praise God
[2621.06 --> 2622.78]  Even when
[2622.78 --> 2623.36]  You feel
[2623.36 --> 2624.20]  Far away
[2624.20 --> 2625.10]  From God
[2625.10 --> 2629.70]  Or what
[2629.70 --> 2629.96]  What I mean
[2629.96 --> 2630.20]  To say
[2630.20 --> 2630.76]  Even when
[2630.76 --> 2631.06]  You don't
[2631.06 --> 2631.90]  Feel near
[2631.90 --> 2632.46]  To God
[2632.46 --> 2633.02]  You are
[2633.02 --> 2633.80]  You are
[2633.80 --> 2634.46]  Near to God
[2634.46 --> 2635.28]  Even when
[2635.28 --> 2635.54]  You feel
[2635.54 --> 2636.10]  Far away
[2636.10 --> 2636.62]  From God
[2636.62 --> 2637.32]  You're not
[2637.32 --> 2637.64]  You are
[2637.64 --> 2638.02]  Near
[2638.02 --> 2638.76]  Because Jesus
[2638.76 --> 2639.36]  Is standing
[2639.36 --> 2639.74]  There
[2639.74 --> 2640.94]  For you
[2640.94 --> 2642.36]  You have
[2642.36 --> 2642.50]  You have a
[2642.50 --> 2642.88]  Priest who
[2642.88 --> 2643.36]  Remains in
[2643.36 --> 2643.76]  The temple
[2643.76 --> 2645.68]  You come
[2645.68 --> 2646.28]  To God
[2646.28 --> 2646.88]  Through Jesus
[2646.88 --> 2647.48]  In Jesus
[2647.48 --> 2647.80]  You are
[2647.80 --> 2648.40]  Standing in
[2648.40 --> 2648.68]  God's
[2648.68 --> 2649.58]  Very presence
[2649.58 --> 2650.60]  In perfect
[2650.60 --> 2651.10]  Fellowship
[2651.10 --> 2651.46]  With him
[2651.46 --> 2652.50]  In perfect
[2652.50 --> 2653.06]  Praise
[2653.06 --> 2653.72]  In perfect
[2653.72 --> 2654.66]  Enjoyment
[2654.66 --> 2655.74]  Of God
[2655.74 --> 2657.92]  So friends
[2657.92 --> 2658.56]  This week
[2658.56 --> 2660.14]  When you
[2660.14 --> 2660.60]  Wake up
[2660.60 --> 2661.18]  Every morning
[2661.18 --> 2661.72]  When you
[2661.72 --> 2662.26]  Go to bed
[2662.26 --> 2663.00]  Every night
[2663.00 --> 2664.18]  Remember that
[2664.18 --> 2664.76]  This is the
[2664.76 --> 2665.26]  Most important
[2665.26 --> 2665.60]  Thing
[2665.60 --> 2666.90]  Right
[2666.90 --> 2667.26]  There you know
[2667.26 --> 2668.36]  We've looked at
[2668.36 --> 2668.96]  These Psalms of
[2668.96 --> 2669.36]  Ascent and
[2669.36 --> 2670.32]  Everyone has
[2670.32 --> 2670.86]  Given us this
[2670.86 --> 2671.80]  Different aspect
[2671.80 --> 2673.04]  Of discipleship
[2673.04 --> 2673.56]  Of what it means
[2673.56 --> 2674.00]  To live the
[2674.00 --> 2674.68]  Christian life
[2674.68 --> 2676.96]  But this is
[2676.96 --> 2677.80]  The overarching
[2677.80 --> 2678.28]  One
[2678.28 --> 2679.26]  Right
[2679.26 --> 2680.00]  There is a
[2680.00 --> 2680.60]  Purpose
[2680.60 --> 2681.42]  For us
[2681.42 --> 2682.28]  Every day
[2682.28 --> 2683.90]  And so what
[2683.90 --> 2684.38]  Are we called
[2684.38 --> 2684.84]  To do
[2684.84 --> 2685.98]  Praise the
[2685.98 --> 2686.22]  Lord
[2686.22 --> 2687.08]  Right
[2687.08 --> 2687.40]  In the midst
[2687.40 --> 2687.94]  Of everything
[2687.94 --> 2688.60]  Else we have
[2688.60 --> 2688.86]  To do
[2688.86 --> 2689.30]  In the midst
[2689.30 --> 2690.10]  Of everything
[2690.10 --> 2690.56]  Else that
[2690.56 --> 2691.56]  Life is about
[2691.56 --> 2692.36]  Overarching
[2692.36 --> 2693.14]  All of
[2693.14 --> 2693.96]  What life
[2693.96 --> 2694.46]  Is
[2694.46 --> 2694.94]  All that
[2694.94 --> 2695.08]  We're
[2695.08 --> 2695.86]  Engaged in
[2695.86 --> 2696.78]  The purpose
[2696.78 --> 2697.16]  Of our
[2697.16 --> 2697.62]  Life
[2697.62 --> 2698.94]  Is to
[2698.94 --> 2699.54]  Praise the
[2699.54 --> 2699.78]  Lord
[2699.78 --> 2703.78]  So that's
[2703.78 --> 2704.58]  The first
[2704.58 --> 2705.06]  Thing we see
[2705.06 --> 2705.48]  And the second
[2705.48 --> 2706.04]  Thing we see
[2706.04 --> 2706.92]  Here in
[2706.92 --> 2707.86]  Psalm 134
[2707.86 --> 2709.44]  Is not just
[2709.44 --> 2710.00]  The invitation
[2710.00 --> 2710.44]  To worship
[2710.44 --> 2710.80]  But the
[2710.80 --> 2711.34]  Blessing of
[2711.34 --> 2711.62]  Worship
[2711.62 --> 2713.18]  The psalmist
[2713.18 --> 2713.68]  Tells us
[2713.68 --> 2714.54]  This incredible
[2714.54 --> 2715.58]  Truth that
[2715.58 --> 2717.06]  God blesses
[2717.06 --> 2717.38]  Us
[2717.38 --> 2718.24]  Right
[2718.24 --> 2719.28]  God blesses
[2719.28 --> 2719.78]  Us
[2719.78 --> 2720.80]  So in
[2720.80 --> 2721.36]  Verse 3
[2721.36 --> 2722.56]  It says
[2722.56 --> 2723.30]  May the
[2723.30 --> 2723.76]  Lord
[2723.76 --> 2725.44]  Bless you
[2725.44 --> 2726.10]  From Zion
[2726.10 --> 2726.92]  He who
[2726.92 --> 2727.16]  Is the
[2727.16 --> 2727.76]  Maker of
[2727.76 --> 2728.30]  Heaven and
[2728.30 --> 2728.64]  Earth
[2728.64 --> 2730.28]  Okay so
[2730.28 --> 2731.12]  Again here
[2731.12 --> 2731.66]  Is the
[2731.66 --> 2732.36]  Last of
[2732.36 --> 2732.74]  The psalms
[2732.74 --> 2733.22]  Of ascent
[2733.22 --> 2733.94]  In the
[2733.94 --> 2734.66]  Very last
[2734.66 --> 2735.24]  Verse
[2735.24 --> 2736.96]  Of the
[2736.96 --> 2737.24]  Psalms
[2737.24 --> 2737.80]  Of ascent
[2737.80 --> 2738.46]  It talks
[2738.46 --> 2739.24]  About not
[2739.24 --> 2739.88]  How we
[2739.88 --> 2740.20]  Are to
[2740.20 --> 2740.40]  Praise
[2740.40 --> 2740.82]  God
[2740.82 --> 2742.52]  But it
[2742.52 --> 2742.88]  Says that
[2742.88 --> 2743.18]  The Lord
[2743.18 --> 2743.68]  Blesses

[2904.00 --> 2904.30]  That
[2904.30 --> 2904.48]  The
[2904.48 --> 2904.82]  Lord
[2904.82 --> 2905.54]  Provided
[2905.54 --> 2906.80]  And
[2906.80 --> 2907.06]  Friends
[2907.06 --> 2907.30]  This
[2907.30 --> 2907.92]  Story
[2907.92 --> 2908.98]  Echoes
[2908.98 --> 2909.44]  Throughout
[2909.44 --> 2910.22]  The
[2910.22 --> 2910.96]  Entire
[2910.96 --> 2911.86]  Bible
[2911.86 --> 2912.94]  Because
[2912.94 --> 2913.38]  This
[2913.38 --> 2913.68]  Is
[2913.68 --> 2913.86]  A
[2913.86 --> 2914.24]  Pointer
[2914.24 --> 2914.46]  To
[2914.46 --> 2914.62]  The
[2914.62 --> 2915.30]  Sacrifice
[2915.30 --> 2915.56]  That
[2915.56 --> 2915.92]  God
[2915.92 --> 2916.50]  Himself
[2916.50 --> 2916.76]  Would
[2916.76 --> 2917.22]  Provide
[2917.22 --> 2917.94]  His
[2917.94 --> 2918.28]  Own
[2918.28 --> 2919.06]  Sacrifice
[2919.06 --> 2919.36]  Not
[2919.36 --> 2919.98]  Ours
[2919.98 --> 2921.62]  Right
[2921.62 --> 2921.88]  So
[2921.88 --> 2922.16]  Not
[2922.16 --> 2922.38]  The
[2922.38 --> 2922.90]  Sacrifice
[2922.90 --> 2923.14]  Of
[2923.14 --> 2924.08]  Abraham's
[2924.08 --> 2924.34]  Son
[2924.34 --> 2924.90]  But
[2924.90 --> 2925.08]  The
[2925.08 --> 2925.70]  Sacrifice
[2925.70 --> 2925.94]  Of
[2925.94 --> 2926.20]  His
[2926.20 --> 2926.64]  Own
[2926.64 --> 2927.06]  Son
[2927.06 --> 2927.44]  Jesus
[2927.44 --> 2930.06]  And
[2930.06 --> 2930.24]  So
[2930.24 --> 2930.48]  Why
[2930.48 --> 2930.60]  Do
[2930.60 --> 2930.72]  We
[2930.72 --> 2931.02]  Praise
[2931.02 --> 2931.20]  The
[2931.20 --> 2931.44]  Lord
[2931.44 --> 2932.70]  All
[2932.70 --> 2932.80]  Right
[2932.80 --> 2932.96]  Why
[2932.96 --> 2933.08]  Do
[2933.08 --> 2933.20]  We
[2933.20 --> 2933.72]  Respond
[2933.72 --> 2933.86]  To
[2933.86 --> 2934.06]  This
[2934.06 --> 2934.58]  Invitation
[2934.58 --> 2934.82]  Why
[2934.82 --> 2934.94]  Do
[2934.94 --> 2935.06]  We
[2935.06 --> 2935.62]  Ascend
[2935.62 --> 2936.34]  The
[2936.34 --> 2936.70]  Mountain
[2936.70 --> 2937.36]  It's
[2937.36 --> 2937.62]  Because
[2937.62 --> 2937.92]  In
[2937.92 --> 2938.32]  Worship
[2938.32 --> 2938.78]  What
[2938.78 --> 2938.94]  We
[2938.94 --> 2939.36]  See
[2939.36 --> 2939.92]  Is
[2939.92 --> 2940.30]  God
[2940.30 --> 2940.64]  Giving
[2940.64 --> 2941.04]  Himself
[2941.04 --> 2941.32]  To
[2941.32 --> 2941.64]  Us
[2941.64 --> 2943.02]  In
[2943.02 --> 2943.30]  Worship
[2943.30 --> 2943.50]  Is
[2943.50 --> 2943.62]  Not
[2943.62 --> 2943.80]  So
[2943.80 --> 2944.00]  Much
[2944.00 --> 2944.20]  About
[2944.20 --> 2944.50]  What
[2944.50 --> 2944.66]  We
[2944.66 --> 2944.78]  Are
[2944.78 --> 2945.04]  Giving
[2945.04 --> 2945.30]  To
[2945.30 --> 2945.92]  God
[2945.92 --> 2946.42]  It
[2946.42 --> 2946.56]  Is
[2946.56 --> 2946.78]  What
[2946.78 --> 2947.38]  God
[2947.38 --> 2947.84]  Is
[2947.84 --> 2948.26]  Giving
[2948.26 --> 2949.18]  To
[2949.18 --> 2949.66]  Us
[2949.66 --> 2950.36]  Who
[2950.36 --> 2950.88]  Benefits
[2950.88 --> 2951.10]  From
[2951.10 --> 2951.32]  This
[2951.32 --> 2952.02]  Transaction
[2952.02 --> 2954.98]  It's
[2954.98 --> 2955.20]  Not
[2955.20 --> 2955.70]  God
[2955.70 --> 2956.96]  We
[2956.96 --> 2957.30]  Do
[2957.30 --> 2958.12]  We
[2958.12 --> 2958.18]  We're
[2958.18 --> 2958.34]  The
[2958.34 --> 2958.56]  Ones
[2958.56 --> 2958.72]  That
[2958.72 --> 2959.20]  Benefit
[2959.20 --> 2960.04]  Right
[2960.04 --> 2960.22]  Think
[2960.22 --> 2960.42]  About
[2960.42 --> 2960.70]  All
[2960.70 --> 2960.88]  The
[2960.88 --> 2961.54]  Sacrifices
[2961.54 --> 2961.70]  In
[2961.70 --> 2961.82]  The
[2961.82 --> 2961.96]  Old
[2961.96 --> 2962.32]  Testament
[2962.32 --> 2962.54]  That
[2962.54 --> 2962.66]  Would
[2962.66 --> 2962.86]  Take
[2962.86 --> 2963.14]  Place
[2963.14 --> 2963.36]  At
[2963.36 --> 2963.50]  The
[2963.50 --> 2963.80]  Temple
[2963.80 --> 2964.58]  Why
[2964.58 --> 2964.88]  On
[2964.88 --> 2965.18]  Earth
[2965.18 --> 2965.40]  Does
[2965.40 --> 2965.68]  God
[2965.68 --> 2966.08]  Ask
[2966.08 --> 2966.86]  Sacrifices
[2966.86 --> 2967.00]  Of
[2967.00 --> 2967.18]  Things
[2967.18 --> 2967.36]  Like
[2967.36 --> 2967.72]  Bulls
[2967.72 --> 2968.00]  And
[2968.00 --> 2968.36]  Goats
[2968.36 --> 2969.76]  Bulls
[2969.76 --> 2969.92]  And
[2969.92 --> 2970.30]  Goats
[2970.30 --> 2971.14]  Right
[2971.14 --> 2971.38]  He
[2971.38 --> 2971.96]  Owns
[2971.96 --> 2972.12]  The
[2972.12 --> 2972.46]  Cattle
[2972.46 --> 2972.66]  On

[2977.50 --> 2977.74]  On
[2977.74 --> 2978.40]  He
[2978.40 --> 2978.72]  Doesn't
[2978.72 --> 2979.06]  Need
[2979.06 --> 2979.28]  Our

[2981.50 --> 2981.68]  To
[2981.68 --> 2981.88]  Him
[2981.88 --> 2982.24]  God

[2982.76 --> 2983.24]  Sufficient
[2983.24 --> 2983.62]  In

[2985.34 --> 2985.58]  All
[2985.58 --> 2986.16]  Eternity
[2986.16 --> 2986.42]  God
[2986.42 --> 2986.60]  Has
[2986.60 --> 2987.10]  Existed
[2987.10 --> 2987.66]  In

[2990.90 --> 2991.30]  Created
[2991.30 --> 2991.46]  Us
[2991.46 --> 2991.56]  He
[2991.56 --> 2991.78]  Doesn't

[2992.26 --> 2992.94]  Our
