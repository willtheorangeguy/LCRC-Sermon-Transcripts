[302.62 → 306.62] Welcome to our worship service this morning on this hot summer day.
[306.62 → 311.62] Whether you're here in person or you're joining us online, you're very welcome.
[311.62 → 314.62] My name is Marian, and I'll be our worship leader this morning.
[314.62 → 321.62] We extend a special welcome to Pastor Gary Aroma, who will be bringing this morning's
[321.62 → 324.62] message and Jenny is with him too.
[324.62 → 329.62] Pastor Gary and Jenny both are well known and loved here.
[329.62 → 334.62] Pastor Gary is a chaplain for seafarers at the Vancouver and Delta ports, and we enjoy hearing
[334.62 → 337.62] about his work, which I'm sure we will this morning.
[337.62 → 344.62] Our offering today is for a world renews work in India during this hard hitting pandemic.
[344.62 → 348.62] Please pray for this country and its people.
[348.62 → 354.62] Poverty and dense population have resulted in so many deaths and bring so many complexities
[354.62 → 357.62] and struggles in a time like this.
[357.62 → 361.62] You may drop off a check at the church or donate online.
[361.62 → 363.62] Thank you for your generosity.
[363.62 → 370.62] At this time I would like to invite Joe, our chair of council, to come up and make an announcement.
[370.62 → 396.48] Bill
[396.48 → 400.72] Good morning and welcome.
[400.72 → 409.84] It's with deep regret and sadness, but with understanding that the Council of Ladder CRC
[411.12 → 417.76] has accepted the withdrawal of Abbas Sergeant Lunala as a deacon nominee.
[418.96 → 425.36] Abbas's withdrawal comes about as a result of unforeseen and extenuating matters.
[426.48 → 436.24] Following this withdrawal, we were also in contact with Marianne Iron, another affirmed deacon nominee.
[437.44 → 444.88] Marianne also advised that due to very recent circumstances and situations in her life,
[445.52 → 451.28] she too is no longer able to let her name stand as a deacon nominee.
[451.28 → 463.04] The Council has accepted these withdrawals, at this time fully recognizing that we hope and pray that both Abbas and Marianne
[463.04 → 471.60] will be able to consider serving in ministry here with us in future when circumstances allow them to do so.
[471.60 → 482.16] We have one remaining affirmed deacon nominee, Kevin Chalk, who will now be appointed as a deacon,
[482.16 → 489.76] along with Michaela Van Ridge, whose name was drawn in a ballot draw a couple of weeks ago.
[489.76 → 497.20] The nomination process has been a long and arduous journey.
[498.56 → 507.52] We just know that you, as a congregation, will fully support and endorse these decisions.
[507.52 → 514.96] It is planned that the installation of our office bearers, John Windermere as elder,
[515.68 → 526.16] Michaela Van Ridge and Kevin Chalk for deacon, to take place on Saturday, July 11th in our worship service.
[526.16 → 527.68] Thank you.
[537.68 → 545.28] On Sundays, we pause from the hectic pace of our week for rest and to worship our Creator and Keeper.
[546.40 → 549.36] This is kind of like pushing the reset button on our lives.
[550.16 → 554.08] Today, our invitation comes from these words of Jesus in John 4.
[554.08 → 563.36] A time is coming and has now come when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
[566.64 → 569.44] For they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.
[570.56 → 576.40] God is spirit and his worshippers must worship in the spirit and in truth.
[577.92 → 583.36] God welcomes us with his grace, mercy and peace in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[584.08 → 588.06] As God greets us, we too extend greetings to one another.
[589.02 → 594.96] Give a wave to someone nearby or perhaps a call or visit later today or in the week.
[594.96 → 614.78] I should mention that when we came in, one of our ushers, Johnny, said that there was no limit on ice caps today.
[614.84 → 615.96] And I said, well, where are they?
[615.96 → 622.60] I thought he should bring in those cold coffees for us all to have in hand during the service.
[622.68 → 623.78] That would have been helpful, I think.
[624.26 → 626.16] We'll get him to do that maybe next time.
[626.16 → 652.30] How lovely, Lord, how lovely is your abiding place.
[652.30 → 661.48] My soul is longing, fainting to feast upon your grace.
[661.48 → 670.72] The sparrow finds a shelter, a place to build her nest.
[670.72 → 680.66] And so your temple calls us within its walls to rest.
[681.76 → 691.24] In your blessed courts to worship, O God, a single day
[691.24 → 700.24] Is better than a thousand if I from you should stray.
[700.24 → 709.76] I'd rather keep the entrance and claim you as my Lord
[709.76 → 718.60] Than revel in the riches the ways of sin afford.
[718.60 → 730.52] A shone and shield forever Are you, O Lord, most high
[730.52 → 739.60] You shower us with blessings No good will you deny
[739.60 → 748.60] The saints your grace receiving From strength to strength shall go
[748.60 → 757.68] And from their life shall rivers A blessing overflow
[757.68 → 766.68] Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[766.68 → 772.68] Who else can make every king bow down?
[772.68 → 791.68] Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[791.68 → 802.68] Holy of holy God What other you do demand such praises?
[802.68 → 807.68] What other splendour outshines the sun?
[807.68 → 814.68] What other majesty rules with justice?
[814.68 → 822.68] Only of holy God Come and behold Him
[822.68 → 834.68] The one and the only Cry out, sing holy Forever a holy God
[834.68 → 841.68] Come and worship the holy God Come and worship the holy God
[841.68 → 854.68] What other glory consumes like fire What other power can raise the dead
[854.68 → 861.68] What other name remains undefeated What other name remains undefeated
[861.68 → 865.68] Only a holy God Come and behold Him
[865.68 → 867.68] What other heart can raise the pure God Come and behold Him
[867.68 → 868.68] Come and behold Him Come and behold Him
[868.68 → 871.68] Come and behold Him The one and the only Cry out, sing holy
[871.68 → 873.68] the holy
[878.32 → 885.68] forever a holy god come and worship the holy god
[885.68 → 905.44] who else could rescue me from my failing who else would offer his only son
[905.44 → 919.44] who else invites me to call him father only a holy god
[919.44 → 921.44] only a holy god
[921.44 → 933.44] and behold him the one and the only cry out sing holy
[933.44 → 945.44] forever a holy god come and worship the holy god
[945.44 → 957.44] come to the lord on the earth let us sing power and majesty praise to the king
[957.44 → 969.44] mountains bow down, and the seas will roar at the sound of your name
[969.44 → 979.44] forever I'll love you forever I'll stand
[979.44 → 991.44] nothing compares to the promise I have in you
[991.44 → 1001.44] my Jesus my saviour lord there is none like you
[1001.44 → 1013.44] all of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love
[1013.44 → 1023.44] my comfort my shelter tower of refuge and strength
[1023.44 → 1035.44] let every breath all that I am never cease to worship you
[1035.44 → 1047.44] shout to the lord on the earth let us sing power and majesty praise to the king
[1047.44 → 1059.44] mountains bow down, and the seas will roar at the sound of your name
[1059.44 → 1061.44] singing the earth let us sing for joy
[1061.44 → 1063.44] sing for joy at the work of your hands
[1063.44 → 1069.44] forever I'll love you forever I'll stand
[1069.44 → 1073.44] nothing compares to the promise I have in you
[1073.44 → 1076.44] I have in you.
[1076.44 → 1080.44] Nothing compares to the promise I have.
[1080.44 → 1089.44] Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1097.44 → 1101.44] Because our human condition comes with selfishness,
[1101.44 → 1105.44] wanting to do things our own way rather than God's way,
[1105.44 → 1110.44] we are compelled to confess our sins when we get together as part of our worship.
[1110.44 → 1115.44] Please join in the bold parts of the responsive prayer.
[1115.44 → 1120.44] Gracious God, our sins are too heavy to carry,
[1120.44 → 1125.44] too real to hide, and too deep to undo.
[1125.44 → 1128.44] Forgive what our lips tremble to name,
[1128.44 → 1131.44] what our hearts can no longer bear,
[1131.44 → 1137.44] and what has become for us a consuming fire of judgment.
[1137.44 → 1141.44] Set us free from a past that we cannot change.
[1141.44 → 1145.44] Open us to a future in which we can be changed,
[1145.44 → 1150.44] and grant us grace to grow more and more in your likeness and image
[1150.44 → 1153.44] through Jesus Christ, the light of the world.
[1153.44 → 1157.44] We will pause now for a silent personal confession.
[1157.44 → 1175.44] This saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance.
[1175.44 → 1180.44] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[1180.44 → 1184.44] He bore our sins in his body on the cross,
[1184.44 → 1189.44] so that free from sins we might live for righteousness.
[1189.44 → 1192.44] By his wounds we are healed.
[1192.44 → 1196.44] Alleluia. Amen.
[1196.44 → 1210.44] I will sing of my Redeemer and his wondrous love to me.
[1210.44 → 1223.44] I will sing of my Redeemer and his wondrous love to me.
[1223.44 → 1228.44] On the cruel cross he suffered,
[1228.44 → 1235.44] From the cursed he set me free.
[1235.44 → 1241.44] Sing, O sing of my Redeemer,
[1241.44 → 1247.44] With his blood he purchased me.
[1247.44 → 1253.44] On the cross he sealed my pardon,
[1253.44 → 1259.44] Paid the debt and made me free.
[1259.44 → 1267.44] I will praise my dear Redeemer,
[1267.44 → 1273.44] His triumphant power I'll tell,
[1273.44 → 1279.44] How the victory he given,
[1279.44 → 1285.44] Over sin and death and hell.
[1285.44 → 1291.44] Sing, O sing of my Redeemer,
[1291.44 → 1296.44] With his blood he purchased me.
[1296.44 → 1300.44] On the cross he sealed my pardon,
[1300.44 → 1301.44] Paid the debt and saved me free.
[1301.44 → 1304.44] On the cross he sealed my pardon,
[1304.44 → 1310.44] Paid the debt and saved me free.
[1310.44 → 1319.44] I will sing of my Redeemer,
[1319.44 → 1324.44] And his heavenly love to me.
[1324.44 → 1330.44] He from death to life has brought me,
[1330.44 → 1335.44] Son of God with him to be.
[1335.44 → 1340.44] Sing, O sing of my Redeemer,
[1340.44 → 1343.44] Sing, O sing of my Redeemer,
[1343.44 → 1349.44] With his blood he purchased me.
[1349.44 → 1355.44] On the cross he sealed my pardon,
[1355.44 → 1360.44] Paid the debt and made me free.
[1360.44 → 1367.44] My God with his blood he purchased me,
[1367.44 → 1369.44] My God with the heart,
[1369.44 → 1370.44] And his love unto you.
[1370.44 → 1375.44] And his way the love that he 실�待 me free.
[1375.44 → 1376.44] Alright.
[1376.44 → 1378.44] My God with his great eyes.
[1378.44 → 1381.44] I'me my God everything by me.
[1381.44 → 1383.44] I'll probably mention my words just
[1383.44 → 1384.44] by her eyes,
[1384.44 → 1385.86] Good morning,
[1385.86 → 1387.44] Good to be here with you.
[1387.44 → 1392.84] We never got to really connect with you in the context of Malaysia, but it actually almost
[1392.84 → 1395.00] feels like that today, huh?
[1395.84 → 1402.40] So it's perfect to be here with you, even with those few who can be here and as well
[1402.40 → 1405.22] as those of you who are attending online.
[1405.98 → 1407.76] Would you bow with me in a word of prayer?
[1408.88 → 1413.16] Heavenly Father, thank you for the opportunity to worship.
[1413.16 → 1421.76] And as we prepare to open your word, lead and guide our thoughts and our reflections
[1421.76 → 1425.64] by the presence of your spirit, the spirit of Jesus.
[1426.52 → 1426.96] Amen.
[1428.50 → 1432.16] I'd invite you to turn in your Bibles to Psalm 73.
[1433.34 → 1437.68] If you have a Bible, you might want to keep that open because we'll be looking at a lot
[1437.68 → 1438.10] of the verses.
[1439.04 → 1441.84] But Psalm 73, before we do that though, I want to share a few pictures.
[1441.84 → 1445.30] Or while you're doing that, looking it up.
[1447.26 → 1455.68] It's been the work at the port continues, and it's sort of been adjusting with the whole
[1455.68 → 1456.80] COVID situation.
[1457.78 → 1459.66] Just wanted to tell a quick story.
[1459.82 → 1461.36] A couple of months ago, this was back in April.
[1462.28 → 1463.48] I was on board a ship.
[1464.04 → 1465.96] It was all Chinese crew.
[1465.96 → 1470.10] And sometimes the English, the language issue can be a bit of a struggle there.
[1470.20 → 1473.84] But at this time, it was a very, very friendly crew.
[1473.94 → 1480.56] They just had some unique people on there who were funny and could just really change the
[1480.56 → 1481.60] whole atmosphere of the ship.
[1481.84 → 1485.08] And I met these two officers and I got chatting with them.
[1485.12 → 1486.18] They had actually very good English.
[1486.18 → 1488.32] So we were in the office chatting.
[1488.90 → 1492.38] And while we were in there, having a perfect conversation, while we were in there,
[1492.80 → 1496.38] guys kept coming in, and they'd say, oh, you're from the Siemens Club.
[1496.86 → 1499.08] I need toothpaste, toothbrush.
[1499.90 → 1500.84] I need soap.
[1501.22 → 1503.48] I need some moisturizing cream.
[1503.56 → 1505.46] You know, because they need this when they're out at sea.
[1505.50 → 1506.22] And all these things.
[1506.28 → 1508.16] And I kept thinking, oh, I didn't bring any of that stuff.
[1508.20 → 1509.62] And they couldn't get off the ship.
[1509.68 → 1512.16] And I'm trying to think, how can I help these guys out?
[1512.96 → 1515.48] So afterwards, I said, well, you know, I'll see if I get a chance.
[1515.56 → 1517.04] So we'll see what we can do for you guys.
[1517.04 → 1520.52] And I went, I was head back to our centre.
[1521.12 → 1524.68] And I was kind of thinking and praying, Lord, how can I help these guys?
[1525.28 → 1530.86] As I arrived at the centre, this is April, remember, middle to later April.
[1531.66 → 1534.90] I arrived at the centre, in pulled another car.
[1535.94 → 1541.68] And it was one of our chief, he had volunteers really with the centre and a big,
[1541.68 → 1544.18] he's very involved from Victoria.
[1545.18 → 1551.62] And he came, and he said, oh, I brought back some Christmas presents.
[1551.86 → 1553.44] And I thought, Christmas presents?
[1554.20 → 1555.98] Because we do have Christmas at sea, right?
[1556.78 → 1560.90] But he had been one of those who had helped with distributing Christmas presents
[1560.90 → 1566.00] for the ships out in Gulf Islands area and some of the anchorages out there.
[1566.00 → 1571.82] And he happened to have a bunch of Christmas gifts left over.
[1572.04 → 1574.80] And that day, he brought them back.
[1575.44 → 1580.20] And I said, Robert, I think you're an answer to prayer.
[1580.60 → 1585.60] Because he had almost 30 new Christmas, of these Christmas bags.
[1585.94 → 1591.14] And every one of them has a toothbrush and toothpaste and soap and moisturizing cream
[1591.14 → 1594.18] and toque and socks and all kinds of other things.
[1594.88 → 1597.72] And so the next day, early in the morning, I said, I'm going to take these.
[1597.80 → 1599.52] And I brought them on board that ship.
[1599.56 → 1600.50] You can show the next picture.
[1601.06 → 1603.82] And I said, guys, you won't believe what happened.
[1604.88 → 1606.24] And I brought this.
[1606.38 → 1610.28] And you could see their mouths just about drop open.
[1610.78 → 1613.44] As I brought these, and I say, I know it's not Christmas.
[1613.44 → 1618.62] But these just showed up, of all things, yesterday when you needed them.
[1618.98 → 1621.08] I said, isn't God good?
[1622.34 → 1625.44] And the one guy kind of said, well, I know, but you worked hard too.
[1625.52 → 1628.62] I said, yeah, but I had nothing to do with providing these.
[1628.80 → 1630.04] I'm just bringing them on board.
[1631.08 → 1633.76] And I thought, what a great testimony to our good God.
[1634.22 → 1636.70] And I hope they're still thinking about that.
[1637.74 → 1639.88] Anyway, it was a beautiful experience.
[1639.88 → 1643.20] I'll go on to the next slide.
[1644.18 → 1646.98] Now, a couple of weeks ago, just about two weeks ago,
[1647.42 → 1653.16] things are changing in the port with COVID vaccinations.
[1653.82 → 1656.48] And especially ships that are coming up from the U.S.
[1656.48 → 1659.74] The U.S. is vaccinating seafarers like crazy.
[1660.08 → 1663.68] They're giving them all the one-shot J&J, Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
[1663.98 → 1666.94] And they're doing it free of charge by the thousands.
[1666.94 → 1672.88] And so almost every ship that comes up, or at least many of them that come up here from,
[1673.02 → 1678.02] say, Seattle, Tacoma, Long Beach, or anything like that, these guys have already been vaccinated.
[1678.40 → 1684.12] And that is actually, and I can tell them, I've been doubly vaccinated.
[1684.12 → 1693.14] And so it's creating an atmosphere on at least more and more ships of a bit more of an openness,
[1693.70 → 1701.20] willingness to come sometimes to the centre, but also inviting me in for amazing meals.
[1701.62 → 1704.20] We used to eat on board all the time.
[1704.96 → 1705.96] You know, it was regular.
[1706.10 → 1709.22] You'd go, and then if it's lunchtime, they say, have lunch with us.
[1709.22 → 1711.04] And that hasn't happened at all.
[1711.16 → 1716.56] It's starting to happen again, which is perfect, not just because I get good meals on board ships,
[1716.76 → 1720.44] but because it's a sign of the way things are changing.
[1720.54 → 1721.74] So we're excited about that.
[1721.98 → 1723.12] And then one more picture.
[1724.00 → 1729.88] This past week, actually Thursday, June 25th, was International Day of the Seafarer.
[1729.98 → 1736.38] It's a day that in the port we remember seafarers, and we try to celebrate them and do something special.
[1736.38 → 1741.24] So usually we have a barbecue, one downtown and one here at Roberts Bank,
[1741.58 → 1747.26] and we have burgers and hot dogs and chips and salad and all kinds, cookies and everything.
[1747.60 → 1750.36] And we have a big party, and we invite all the crew.
[1750.46 → 1751.98] Come on, come on, as many as you can.
[1752.04 → 1754.72] We pick them up when we can and invite them to the centre.
[1755.10 → 1758.56] That didn't happen last year, and it wasn't going to happen this year as far as we can see
[1758.56 → 1761.56] because still most ships aren't allowed to leave their ship.
[1761.60 → 1763.18] Most crews aren't allowed to leave their ships.
[1763.18 → 1768.36] So what we did this year, we said we're going to bring Day of the Seafarer to them.
[1768.88 → 1773.84] And so we got a big donation from the ILWU, the International Longshore Workers Union,
[1774.28 → 1776.08] and we put in a bunch.
[1776.40 → 1783.22] And so we brought pizzas, big, extra-large pizzas to many, many ships in the port.
[1783.48 → 1784.86] And we didn't do it just on Friday.
[1785.04 → 1786.56] We did it all week long.
[1786.56 → 1788.72] And so this was one of the first ones.
[1788.78 → 1792.30] I brought it on to these guys, and they love their pizza.
[1793.20 → 1796.40] And one of our workers, Vincent, he's a Chinese guy,
[1796.58 → 1803.02] he actually brought a whole meal of Peking duck to a crew with Chinese,
[1803.18 → 1805.34] and they were just over the moon about this.
[1805.38 → 1809.30] So it was really a fun week just this past week and sort of topped it off,
[1809.38 → 1810.52] just finished it up yesterday.
[1810.70 → 1811.52] So that's been exciting.
[1811.70 → 1812.90] That's what's happening in the port.
[1812.90 → 1814.12] It's continuing.
[1814.26 → 1815.00] The work is going on.
[1815.08 → 1817.76] So thanks for your prayers and your continued support.
[1817.96 → 1818.54] It's perfect.
[1818.96 → 1820.14] We appreciate it.
[1821.48 → 1822.92] Psalm 73.
[1826.66 → 1828.52] A psalm of Asaph.
[1830.86 → 1836.26] Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
[1837.28 → 1841.24] But as for me, my feet had almost slipped.
[1841.24 → 1847.96] I had nearly lost my foothold, for I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[1848.96 → 1850.18] They have no struggles.
[1850.32 → 1852.14] Their bodies are healthy and strong.
[1852.24 → 1854.58] They are free from common human burdens.
[1854.96 → 1856.88] They are not plagued by human ills.
[1857.76 → 1859.54] Therefore, pride is their necklace.
[1859.94 → 1861.74] They clothe themselves with violence.
[1862.30 → 1864.52] From their callous hearts comes iniquity.
[1865.02 → 1867.46] Their evil imaginations have no limits.
[1867.46 → 1869.80] They scoff and speak with malice.
[1869.92 → 1871.74] With arrogance they threaten oppression.
[1872.40 → 1876.60] Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.
[1877.32 → 1880.78] Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
[1881.02 → 1883.46] They say, how would God know?
[1883.86 → 1886.00] Does the Most High know anything?
[1886.00 → 1888.96] This is what the wicked are like.
[1889.68 → 1893.58] Always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.
[1895.22 → 1901.38] Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure, and have washed my hands in innocence.
[1901.60 → 1906.60] All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.
[1906.60 → 1911.36] If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children.
[1912.06 → 1915.68] When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply.
[1916.64 → 1923.02] Till I entered the sanctuary of God, then I understood their final destiny.
[1924.10 → 1926.52] Surely you place them on slippery ground.
[1926.84 → 1928.38] You cast them down to ruin.
[1928.60 → 1933.70] How suddenly they are destroyed, completely swept away by terrors.
[1933.70 → 1936.38] They are like a dream when one awakes.
[1936.90 → 1941.06] When you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.
[1942.38 → 1947.34] When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant.
[1947.86 → 1951.42] I was a brute beast before you, yet I am always with you.
[1951.76 → 1953.58] You hold me by my right hand.
[1953.70 → 1957.94] You guide me with your counsel, and afterward, you will take me into glory.
[1959.32 → 1961.50] Whom have I in heaven but you?
[1961.50 → 1966.00] And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
[1966.12 → 1972.82] My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[1973.78 → 1976.30] Those who are far from you will perish.
[1977.28 → 1979.82] You destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
[1981.08 → 1984.56] But as for me, it is good to be near God.
[1985.08 → 1987.52] I have made the sovereign Lord my refuge.
[1987.52 → 1990.44] I will tell of all your deeds.
[1992.48 → 1998.98] A while back, I was on a ship, and I got into a conversation with a couple of Ukrainian officers.
[1999.64 → 2004.58] I don't know the Ukrainian situation all that well personally, but they were sharing a little bit,
[2004.82 → 2007.68] and I'm just giving their perspective what they shared.
[2007.68 → 2012.40] But they were complaining about the situation back in Ukraine.
[2012.50 → 2016.22] They said the economy is a disaster.
[2017.86 → 2023.68] Those of us, if you want to find work, at least work that pays anything worthwhile,
[2023.84 → 2025.76] you basically have to leave the country.
[2026.14 → 2030.88] And you have to go to other countries, or you have to get on board a ship.
[2030.88 → 2036.52] And you have to do the jobs that no one else wants to do.
[2037.34 → 2042.14] We have to go, we go to these other countries in Europe and do a lot of the manual labour.
[2042.22 → 2045.50] Now, I'm sure there are other places that feel the same way, but that was their sense.
[2045.62 → 2049.02] We're the ones that have to go on ships because nobody else wants to do this job,
[2049.78 → 2053.38] but because we're the ones who are desperate almost to have to do it.
[2053.38 → 2054.30] And that was their sense.
[2054.64 → 2057.78] And then they said, and what really gets us is,
[2058.50 → 2071.58] it's these corrupt politicians who live so well and who are profiting while we struggle.
[2072.72 → 2075.70] It's just not fair.
[2075.70 → 2084.40] Well, that, at least in the sense of the feeling that those seafarers were sharing,
[2085.18 → 2089.48] is quite similar to what the psalmist is sharing here.
[2091.54 → 2094.72] In fact, the psalmist is saying, I've kept my heart pure.
[2095.34 → 2096.90] I've done all I can.
[2096.90 → 2106.04] And Lord, why do those who reject you prosper while we are struggling?
[2107.20 → 2113.90] The righteous, those who are being faithful to your Torah, your law, your instructions.
[2116.60 → 2120.58] Interesting, the psalm begins, and if you have your Bibles open, you can see this.
[2120.58 → 2129.00] The psalm begins in verse 1 with this really powerful confession of faith and of the goodness of God.
[2129.50 → 2132.76] Surely God is good to Israel.
[2137.12 → 2140.90] To those who are pure in heart.
[2142.20 → 2146.20] And the key in this psalm really is the heart.
[2146.20 → 2151.52] Because if you look carefully, the word heart comes up six times in this psalm.
[2152.60 → 2159.96] And his point is, it's so much more important, the attitude of our hearts,
[2160.30 → 2164.94] rather than the circumstances of our lives.
[2165.54 → 2169.46] It's the heart that is the really important.
[2169.46 → 2171.14] Not that the circumstances don't matter,
[2171.14 → 2176.18] but it's really the heart that is the most important part.
[2176.62 → 2177.74] Keep our focus there.
[2179.54 → 2187.92] But the psalm then quickly shifts to what the biblical scholar Walter Brueggemann refers to as disorientation.
[2188.92 → 2195.64] It's right away, it's just in this place of almost despair
[2195.64 → 2199.64] about how the wicked and the arrogant,
[2200.80 → 2202.32] those who are rejecting God,
[2202.46 → 2204.38] how they thrive.
[2205.62 → 2206.40] Verse 12,
[2207.42 → 2209.30] this is what the wicked are like.
[2209.86 → 2211.92] Always free of care,
[2212.36 → 2215.28] they go on amassing wealth.
[2216.78 → 2217.90] And not only that,
[2218.28 → 2221.76] they flaunt their rejection of God.
[2222.08 → 2223.52] They boast about it.
[2223.52 → 2224.16] Verse 11,
[2224.50 → 2225.00] they say,
[2225.26 → 2226.78] how would God know?
[2227.08 → 2229.32] Does the Most High know anything?
[2230.84 → 2231.92] We're good.
[2232.40 → 2234.04] Everything's great for us.
[2234.56 → 2235.30] Who cares?
[2236.16 → 2240.18] Why are you bothering following this God of yours?
[2240.18 → 2249.82] And so the psalmist here reflects this feeling of,
[2250.40 → 2255.00] it's in vain that I've lived righteously before God.
[2255.08 → 2255.84] Verse 13,
[2256.36 → 2259.22] surely in vain I have kept my heart pure.
[2259.32 → 2260.04] Remember the heart.
[2260.54 → 2261.94] I've kept my heart pure
[2261.94 → 2264.98] and have washed my hands in innocence.
[2264.98 → 2266.50] And not only that,
[2266.70 → 2267.66] things seem to,
[2267.86 → 2272.20] even in the midst of me maintaining that purity,
[2272.90 → 2275.58] things seem to be going from bad to worse.
[2276.08 → 2276.82] Verse 14,
[2277.24 → 2280.18] all day long I have been inflicted
[2280.18 → 2284.24] and every morning brings new punishments.
[2285.74 → 2289.48] It's just going in the totally wrong direction, he says.
[2289.48 → 2292.54] Now then he catches himself,
[2293.68 → 2294.52] the psalmist does.
[2295.24 → 2295.86] And he says,
[2296.14 → 2298.06] but I can't say that.
[2298.76 → 2302.28] Because to do that would be so damaging to God's people.
[2302.42 → 2303.10] Verse 15,
[2303.38 → 2304.82] if I had spoken out like that,
[2304.96 → 2306.76] I would have betrayed your children.
[2307.02 → 2307.26] It just,
[2307.88 → 2308.54] I would,
[2308.66 → 2310.26] it would be so hard on everybody.
[2310.64 → 2312.28] I can't really say this.
[2312.34 → 2313.82] I can't even confess it.
[2314.06 → 2315.80] But it is my experience.
[2315.80 → 2317.20] It's how I feel.
[2319.48 → 2323.70] It feels so unfair,
[2324.56 → 2325.50] says the psalmist.
[2326.52 → 2330.38] Leading one writer to describe Psalm 73
[2330.38 → 2333.68] as the book of Job in a nutshell.
[2336.38 → 2338.00] That's the feeling here.
[2338.38 → 2339.40] Why, Lord?
[2339.82 → 2340.44] Why?
[2341.80 → 2342.22] Now,
[2342.58 → 2345.08] around the middle of the psalm,
[2345.08 → 2347.58] it begins to shift
[2347.58 → 2350.80] from this disorientation,
[2351.08 → 2351.78] Lord, why?
[2352.44 → 2354.28] To a new perspective,
[2354.46 → 2356.84] a new or a reorientation.
[2357.34 → 2359.00] It takes a little time though,
[2359.06 → 2359.58] as you notice.
[2359.72 → 2361.22] He kind of goes back and forth for a bit
[2361.22 → 2363.72] until he finally shifts into that.
[2364.68 → 2367.02] It begins really at verse 17.
[2367.02 → 2371.50] And this is the crucial turning point.
[2372.08 → 2372.60] Until.
[2373.78 → 2375.34] Until, he says.
[2375.82 → 2376.72] Verse 17.
[2377.92 → 2381.88] Until I entered the sanctuary of God,
[2381.96 → 2384.86] the holy place of God.
[2387.36 → 2389.18] Then I understood.
[2390.06 → 2391.98] Then I understood their destiny.
[2391.98 → 2395.46] It wasn't until he entered the holy place.
[2395.96 → 2396.10] Now,
[2396.28 → 2397.22] the sanctuary,
[2397.70 → 2399.54] the holy place that he's referring to,
[2399.86 → 2401.40] specifically in that context,
[2401.50 → 2403.30] refers basically to the temple,
[2403.76 → 2405.32] the original tabernacle,
[2405.80 → 2408.10] the place of God's presence.
[2408.88 → 2409.58] In other words,
[2409.80 → 2412.02] instead of looking around
[2412.02 → 2414.02] at the surrounding circumstances,
[2414.26 → 2415.84] he shifts his gaze, right?
[2415.84 → 2418.10] He begins to look up.
[2418.74 → 2420.04] To look to God.
[2420.16 → 2422.78] To get his perspective renewed.
[2423.10 → 2427.44] His orientation repaired and fixed
[2427.44 → 2430.24] and refreshed before God.
[2430.46 → 2432.52] He puts his eyes on God.
[2433.86 → 2434.30] Now,
[2434.40 → 2435.36] there are other psalms
[2435.36 → 2439.70] that have a similar kind of reflection.
[2440.68 → 2441.02] You know,
[2441.04 → 2441.62] it's not fair,
[2441.78 → 2443.20] but wait a minute.
[2443.96 → 2445.20] If I keep my eyes on God,
[2445.20 → 2445.78] it's okay.
[2446.96 → 2447.30] Psalm,
[2447.52 → 2448.52] just the opposite of this,
[2448.56 → 2449.34] instead of 73,
[2449.68 → 2450.92] Psalm 37.
[2451.66 → 2452.74] In Psalm 37,
[2453.06 → 2455.80] it has many of the same themes
[2455.80 → 2456.74] as this psalm,
[2456.84 → 2459.36] except more from the perspective of
[2459.36 → 2461.18] after he realizes it
[2461.18 → 2463.24] and he can really praise God
[2463.24 → 2464.42] in the midst of all that.
[2464.68 → 2464.82] So,
[2464.92 → 2465.34] for example,
[2465.50 → 2466.34] Psalm 37,
[2466.74 → 2468.26] beginning at verse 35,
[2469.54 → 2473.18] I have seen a wicked and ruthless man
[2473.18 → 2477.60] flourishing like a luxurious native tree,
[2478.60 → 2479.58] but soon,
[2480.22 → 2482.00] he soon passed away
[2482.00 → 2483.46] and was no more.
[2484.08 → 2485.06] Though I looked for him,
[2485.40 → 2486.38] he could not be found.
[2486.70 → 2487.96] Consider the blameless.
[2488.50 → 2489.50] Observe the upright.
[2489.50 → 2491.74] A future awaits those
[2491.74 → 2493.36] who seek peace,
[2493.58 → 2495.64] but all sinners will be destroyed.
[2496.18 → 2498.26] There will be no future for the wicked.
[2498.38 → 2500.06] This is sort of after the fact.
[2500.16 → 2501.12] He's realized,
[2501.50 → 2502.24] oh God,
[2503.00 → 2504.24] this is really,
[2504.42 → 2505.94] this is what it's really about.
[2506.36 → 2508.00] But his focus is on the Lord.
[2508.96 → 2510.40] And then another,
[2510.58 → 2511.10] just briefly,
[2511.24 → 2511.86] Psalm 92,
[2512.42 → 2513.82] that famous Sabbath psalm,
[2514.12 → 2515.28] 92 verse 7.
[2515.28 → 2518.76] Though the wicked spring up like grass
[2518.76 → 2521.60] and all evildoers flourish.
[2521.70 → 2522.74] I don't know if that's totally true,
[2522.80 → 2523.90] but you get the point, right?
[2524.06 → 2526.26] Evildoers do often flourish.
[2527.06 → 2530.14] They will be destroyed forever.
[2531.80 → 2533.24] So that theme comes up
[2533.24 → 2534.58] throughout the Psalms,
[2534.66 → 2536.02] but here in Psalm 73,
[2536.28 → 2537.98] it's particularly in that sense
[2537.98 → 2540.10] of the struggle.
[2540.10 → 2546.36] He enters the holy place,
[2546.94 → 2548.70] the sanctuary,
[2549.56 → 2552.08] the presence of God.
[2552.88 → 2554.10] I don't have this verse.
[2554.18 → 2555.04] I came up with it later
[2555.04 → 2556.40] after we'd done all the slides,
[2556.52 → 2558.46] but I was reading just recently
[2558.46 → 2560.44] in 2 Kings
[2560.44 → 2563.16] and the Hezekiah story.
[2563.80 → 2565.56] And you remember when Sennacherib,
[2565.82 → 2566.64] the Assyrian,
[2567.02 → 2568.26] and the Assyrians come
[2568.26 → 2569.94] and they threaten Jerusalem.
[2570.90 → 2572.68] And they say,
[2572.88 → 2573.18] you know,
[2573.26 → 2574.36] who's this God?
[2574.48 → 2574.70] You know,
[2574.76 → 2576.06] actually he sent us
[2576.06 → 2577.84] and why are you placing your faith?
[2578.06 → 2580.12] And they have all these threats.
[2581.00 → 2583.04] And then those who met
[2583.04 → 2584.06] with their leaders
[2584.06 → 2585.30] come and report
[2585.30 → 2587.16] to King Hezekiah.
[2587.70 → 2590.62] And in 2 Kings 19,
[2590.82 → 2591.86] verse 1,
[2592.14 → 2593.26] we're told this.
[2593.42 → 2595.42] When Hezekiah receives
[2595.42 → 2597.40] that threatening report,
[2597.40 → 2599.74] and I love,
[2599.80 → 2600.26] I'm going to read it
[2600.26 → 2601.12] from the ESV,
[2601.46 → 2602.30] the English Standard Version,
[2602.40 → 2603.40] because I think they do it better.
[2603.98 → 2607.02] As soon as Hezekiah heard it,
[2607.52 → 2609.44] he tore his clothes
[2609.44 → 2610.92] and covered himself
[2610.92 → 2611.76] with sackcloth
[2611.76 → 2614.16] and went into the house
[2614.16 → 2615.00] of the Lord.
[2617.10 → 2618.86] Later, they send a letter even,
[2619.06 → 2619.60] and it says,
[2619.74 → 2620.86] he brought the letter
[2620.86 → 2621.86] to the house of the Lord,
[2621.86 → 2623.26] and he opened it up
[2623.26 → 2624.22] before God.
[2624.64 → 2624.90] It's like,
[2625.06 → 2625.66] look, Lord,
[2626.62 → 2627.42] have you heard?
[2627.72 → 2628.52] Have you seen
[2628.52 → 2629.42] what they're saying?
[2630.68 → 2631.04] Lord.
[2631.46 → 2632.82] But I just love that story.
[2632.92 → 2633.58] He goes right
[2633.58 → 2634.70] to the house of the Lord.
[2635.40 → 2635.98] Here, Lord.
[2636.52 → 2636.84] Here.
[2638.66 → 2640.50] And it's through that
[2640.50 → 2641.86] that he finds
[2641.86 → 2643.86] consolation
[2643.86 → 2646.48] and hope.
[2648.70 → 2649.84] Like the psalmist says
[2649.84 → 2651.00] in Psalm 122,
[2651.24 → 2652.16] I was glad
[2652.16 → 2653.16] when they said to me,
[2653.56 → 2654.26] let us go
[2654.26 → 2655.40] to the house
[2655.40 → 2656.50] of the Lord.
[2657.28 → 2658.08] Let us go
[2658.08 → 2659.70] and meet God.
[2662.60 → 2663.80] I was thinking about this
[2663.80 → 2664.56] in the context
[2664.56 → 2665.58] of COVID
[2665.58 → 2667.72] and the lack
[2667.72 → 2670.16] of the opportunity
[2670.16 → 2671.58] for a long time
[2671.58 → 2673.14] for most of us
[2673.14 → 2676.14] to go in person
[2676.14 → 2677.50] and in a sense
[2677.50 → 2678.60] say come to
[2678.60 → 2679.20] the place of worship.
[2679.32 → 2680.44] Now, I'm not equating
[2680.44 → 2682.16] our church buildings
[2682.16 → 2683.26] with the temple
[2683.26 → 2684.28] or anything like that.
[2684.34 → 2685.48] I think the temple
[2685.48 → 2686.60] is much more a type
[2686.60 → 2687.50] for us
[2687.50 → 2689.04] of Jesus himself
[2689.04 → 2690.84] as the true temple,
[2691.28 → 2692.34] the true presence
[2692.34 → 2692.76] of God.
[2693.10 → 2693.38] Nonetheless,
[2693.70 → 2695.24] this is an important place
[2695.24 → 2696.86] where we gather
[2696.86 → 2699.92] and we worship God.
[2700.16 → 2701.82] we hear from God
[2701.82 → 2704.22] and for a long time
[2704.22 → 2705.48] we have not been able
[2705.48 → 2706.36] to do that,
[2707.10 → 2708.56] at least not
[2708.56 → 2710.34] in the usual way.
[2711.06 → 2711.58] Fortunately,
[2711.58 → 2712.78] we have things like
[2712.78 → 2713.58] Zoom
[2713.58 → 2714.76] and live streams
[2714.76 → 2715.92] and all that kind of stuff
[2715.92 → 2716.60] that we can use
[2716.60 → 2717.86] and that's been a
[2718.08 → 2719.14] it's been an okay
[2719.14 → 2720.26] fill-in,
[2720.62 → 2721.94] but it's not the same thing.
[2721.94 → 2723.44] And what worries me
[2723.44 → 2723.86] a little bit
[2723.86 → 2726.02] is when this COVID thing
[2726.02 → 2726.82] finally,
[2727.12 → 2728.00] at least we get back
[2728.00 → 2730.20] to some sense of normalcy
[2730.20 → 2731.44] and we can gather again,
[2731.92 → 2732.80] are there going to be
[2732.80 → 2733.62] some people who will say,
[2733.70 → 2734.38] yeah, why bother?
[2735.38 → 2736.12] I don't know.
[2736.98 → 2739.02] I hope it will be
[2739.02 → 2740.30] this sense of relief
[2740.30 → 2741.22] like, wow,
[2741.60 → 2744.08] we can gather again
[2744.08 → 2746.00] as God's people.
[2746.00 → 2749.32] we can really be together
[2749.32 → 2751.76] and seek the Lord,
[2751.98 → 2753.14] seek our God.
[2753.14 → 2757.54] But particularly,
[2757.74 → 2758.98] I want to look at
[2758.98 → 2760.08] real briefly here,
[2760.28 → 2761.78] beginning at verse 23,
[2761.92 → 2763.34] when this psalm
[2763.34 → 2765.70] switches to this,
[2766.08 → 2767.40] this sense of
[2767.40 → 2768.90] the hopefulness.
[2769.72 → 2770.56] Now God,
[2770.96 → 2772.00] His orientation
[2772.00 → 2773.36] is repaired,
[2773.52 → 2774.32] it's fixed again.
[2774.60 → 2775.30] Verse 23,
[2775.78 → 2777.26] yet I am,
[2777.32 → 2778.00] and I like the word,
[2778.32 → 2780.78] continually with you.
[2780.78 → 2781.64] I'm always with you.
[2781.72 → 2782.88] I'm continually
[2782.88 → 2784.20] with you.
[2784.30 → 2785.80] You hold me by my right hand.
[2786.08 → 2787.48] Now that little term,
[2787.84 → 2789.84] I am with you,
[2790.62 → 2791.68] is a key one
[2791.68 → 2793.16] also in this psalm.
[2794.06 → 2795.42] I am continually
[2795.42 → 2797.68] with you.
[2797.78 → 2799.56] The sense of communion
[2799.56 → 2800.26] with God,
[2800.94 → 2802.64] the psalmist in Psalm 105
[2802.64 → 2803.20] says,
[2803.52 → 2804.08] look to the Lord
[2804.08 → 2804.86] in His strength,
[2805.28 → 2806.60] seek His face
[2806.60 → 2808.14] continually,
[2809.34 → 2810.88] continually,
[2811.10 → 2812.74] always seeking,
[2812.88 → 2813.70] His face,
[2814.00 → 2814.98] His presence,
[2815.34 → 2816.64] to be with God.
[2816.80 → 2817.78] And then we come down
[2817.78 → 2819.04] to verse 25.
[2820.14 → 2821.30] This was the verse
[2821.30 → 2821.96] when I was reading
[2821.96 → 2822.64] through this psalm
[2822.64 → 2823.24] a while back.
[2823.36 → 2823.50] I got,
[2823.94 → 2825.58] it just struck me.
[2826.08 → 2827.88] Whom have I in heaven
[2827.88 → 2828.90] but you,
[2829.30 → 2830.00] and earth
[2830.00 → 2832.36] has nothing I desire
[2832.36 → 2833.54] besides you.
[2833.54 → 2834.92] Now what struck me
[2834.92 → 2836.32] especially was
[2836.32 → 2838.06] the literal translation,
[2838.24 → 2839.52] what the Hebrew says
[2839.52 → 2840.72] in that verse.
[2841.02 → 2841.94] And this is what it
[2841.94 → 2842.92] literally says.
[2843.58 → 2844.22] It's a bit wooden
[2844.22 → 2844.52] but
[2844.52 → 2846.38] just
[2846.38 → 2847.84] bear with me
[2847.84 → 2848.66] and follow me here.
[2849.18 → 2850.38] It literally says this,
[2851.24 → 2851.62] who
[2851.62 → 2853.18] to me
[2853.18 → 2855.20] in the heavens
[2855.20 → 2859.20] and with you
[2859.20 → 2861.18] there is not
[2861.18 → 2862.68] that I desire
[2862.68 → 2863.72] on earth.
[2865.22 → 2865.82] Who
[2865.82 → 2866.44] to me
[2866.44 → 2867.22] in the heavens
[2867.22 → 2867.96] and
[2867.96 → 2869.36] with you
[2869.36 → 2870.16] and it picks up
[2870.16 → 2870.80] that sense of
[2870.80 → 2872.46] the with you
[2872.46 → 2873.22] Lord.
[2874.16 → 2875.22] With you
[2875.22 → 2876.54] there is not
[2876.54 → 2877.46] that I desire
[2877.46 → 2878.02] on earth.
[2878.08 → 2878.82] There's nothing else
[2878.82 → 2879.78] for me.
[2879.78 → 2882.04] And that sense
[2882.04 → 2882.52] again of
[2882.52 → 2883.72] God's presence
[2883.72 → 2884.04] and
[2884.04 → 2886.66] being in
[2886.66 → 2887.56] God's presence
[2887.56 → 2888.32] is
[2888.32 → 2889.18] continually
[2889.18 → 2890.80] this is what I need
[2890.80 → 2891.14] to be
[2891.14 → 2892.28] with you
[2892.28 → 2892.80] Lord.
[2893.50 → 2893.92] And so
[2893.92 → 2895.00] over down in
[2895.00 → 2896.08] verse 27
[2896.08 → 2897.92] those who
[2897.92 → 2898.32] are
[2898.32 → 2899.38] far
[2899.38 → 2900.68] from you
[2900.68 → 2902.26] will perish.
[2904.10 → 2904.66] And
[2904.66 → 2905.26] actually
[2905.26 → 2905.84] literally
[2905.84 → 2906.54] the next line
[2906.54 → 2906.82] says
[2906.82 → 2907.96] you destroy
[2907.96 → 2909.32] all who are
[2909.32 → 2909.74] faithful
[2909.74 → 2911.06] the translation
[2911.06 → 2911.80] is to you
[2911.80 → 2912.36] but literally
[2912.36 → 2912.74] it says
[2912.74 → 2914.02] you destroy
[2914.02 → 2914.66] all those
[2914.66 → 2915.24] who are
[2915.24 → 2917.74] unfaithful
[2917.74 → 2919.30] from you.
[2920.00 → 2920.38] And it's
[2920.38 → 2920.98] that sense
[2920.98 → 2922.22] of distance
[2922.22 → 2923.36] from God.
[2923.64 → 2924.32] That's what
[2924.32 → 2924.70] it's like
[2924.70 → 2925.20] for those
[2925.20 → 2925.62] who are
[2925.62 → 2926.28] unfaithful.
[2926.86 → 2927.20] But
[2927.20 → 2928.72] as for me
[2928.72 → 2930.02] it is good
[2930.02 → 2930.66] to be
[2930.66 → 2931.94] near
[2931.94 → 2933.20] God.
[2935.12 → 2936.12] To be
[2936.12 → 2936.88] with
[2936.88 → 2937.86] you.
[2937.86 → 2941.70] And
[2941.70 → 2941.98] notice
[2941.98 → 2942.46] that he
[2942.46 → 2943.08] says
[2943.08 → 2943.58] it is
[2943.58 → 2944.34] good.
[2944.82 → 2945.10] He
[2945.10 → 2945.46] picks up
[2945.46 → 2945.90] the good
[2945.90 → 2946.42] from verse
[2946.42 → 2946.78] one.
[2947.30 → 2947.50] It's an
[2947.50 → 2948.10] inclusion.
[2948.60 → 2948.96] And he
[2948.96 → 2949.44] picks up
[2949.44 → 2949.72] it's
[2949.72 → 2950.10] to.
[2950.14 → 2950.34] It's
[2950.34 → 2950.92] good
[2950.92 → 2952.36] to be
[2952.36 → 2953.06] near
[2953.06 → 2954.02] God.
[2954.36 → 2954.96] And then
[2954.96 → 2955.24] he goes
[2955.24 → 2955.54] on to
[2955.54 → 2955.98] refer to
[2955.98 → 2956.12] the
[2956.12 → 2957.28] sovereign
[2957.28 → 2957.60] Lord.
[2957.72 → 2957.90] It's
[2957.90 → 2958.16] actually
[2958.16 → 2958.92] the only
[2958.92 → 2959.60] reference
[2959.60 → 2960.34] in this
[2960.34 → 2960.98] psalm
[2960.98 → 2961.54] to
[2961.54 → 2962.48] the name
[2962.48 → 2963.00] Yahweh
[2963.00 → 2963.82] to the
[2963.82 → 2964.14] Lord
[2964.14 → 2964.64] God
[2964.64 → 2965.68] Yahweh
[2965.68 → 2965.98] his
[2965.98 → 2966.84] divine
[2966.84 → 2967.62] name.
[2972.30 → 2973.16] And then
[2973.16 → 2973.48] I thought
[2973.48 → 2973.90] about this
[2973.90 → 2974.82] verse 25.
[2975.74 → 2975.92] There's
[2975.92 → 2976.64] nothing
[2976.64 → 2977.30] else
[2977.30 → 2977.82] I
[2977.82 → 2978.54] desire
[2978.54 → 2979.06] on
[2979.06 → 2979.44] earth.
[2981.82 → 2982.70] Is that
[2982.70 → 2983.06] true?
[2983.06 → 2984.22] Is that
[2984.22 → 2985.16] true?
[2985.52 → 2986.32] Is that
[2986.32 → 2986.98] really
[2986.98 → 2987.52] true
[2987.52 → 2989.04] for us?
[2989.04 → 2992.14] We
[2992.14 → 2992.48] made a
[2992.48 → 2992.72] habit
[2992.72 → 2993.06] during
[2993.06 → 2993.36] COVID.
[2994.48 → 2994.86] It
[2994.86 → 2995.28] started
[2995.28 → 2995.58] I don't
[2995.58 → 2995.72] know
[2995.72 → 2995.96] a while
[2995.96 → 2996.32] back
[2996.32 → 2996.58] and I
[2996.58 → 2997.10] would
[2997.10 → 2997.42] walk
[2997.42 → 2997.64] out
[2997.64 → 2997.84] on
[2997.84 → 2998.18] Sunday
[2998.18 → 2998.64] mornings
[2998.64 → 2999.74] and I
[2999.74 → 2999.92] would
[2999.92 → 3000.44] pick up
[3000.44 → 3000.70] we have
[3000.70 → 3000.88] this
[3000.88 → 3001.28] great
[3001.28 → 3001.78] bakery
[3001.78 → 3002.40] near us
[3002.40 → 3003.26] and they
[3003.26 → 3003.44] make
[3003.44 → 3003.70] some
[3003.70 → 3004.80] divine
[3004.80 → 3006.86] cinnamon
[3006.86 → 3007.36] buns.
[3008.12 → 3008.94] And I
[3008.94 → 3009.52] started
[3009.52 → 3010.10] doing this
[3010.10 → 3010.58] and now
[3010.58 → 3010.78] it's
[3010.78 → 3011.06] become
[3011.06 → 3011.26] this
[3011.26 → 3011.84] tradition
[3011.84 → 3012.52] it's
[3012.52 → 3012.64] an
[3012.64 → 3013.38] expectation
[3013.38 → 3015.22] and you
[3015.22 → 3015.72] pick up
[3015.72 → 3016.16] these
[3016.16 → 3016.72] and we
[3016.72 → 3016.90] get
[3016.90 → 3017.24] cinnamon
[3017.24 → 3017.62] buns
[3017.62 → 3018.64] on Sunday
[3018.64 → 3018.98] morning.
[3019.04 → 3019.56] This is
[3019.56 → 3020.02] really a
[3020.02 → 3020.24] nice
[3020.24 → 3020.70] tradition
[3020.70 → 3021.82] and this
[3021.82 → 3022.12] morning
[3022.12 → 3022.62] I just
[3022.62 → 3022.98] picked up
[3022.98 → 3023.44] these fresh
[3023.44 → 3023.76] cinnamon
[3023.76 → 3024.04] buns
[3024.04 → 3024.26] again
[3024.26 → 3024.56] I brought
[3024.56 → 3024.84] them back
[3024.84 → 3026.02] and Sam
[3026.02 → 3026.46] was there
[3026.46 → 3026.76] at the
[3026.76 → 3027.00] table
[3027.00 → 3027.30] eating
[3027.30 → 3027.58] and he
[3027.58 → 3027.80] said
[3027.80 → 3029.42] oh these
[3029.42 → 3030.34] are so
[3030.34 → 3031.58] good
[3031.58 → 3033.30] fresh
[3033.30 → 3034.56] warm
[3034.56 → 3035.08] cinnamon
[3035.08 → 3035.38] buns
[3035.38 → 3036.18] nothing
[3036.18 → 3036.70] else I
[3036.70 → 3037.10] desire
[3037.10 → 3037.60] on earth
[3037.60 → 3038.10] there's a
[3038.10 → 3038.62] few things
[3038.62 → 3039.08] I actually
[3039.08 → 3039.60] desire
[3039.60 → 3040.20] and enjoy
[3040.20 → 3040.68] on earth
[3040.68 → 3040.96] right
[3040.96 → 3042.60] there's a
[3042.60 → 3043.42] few other
[3043.42 → 3044.06] things
[3044.06 → 3045.58] and I
[3045.58 → 3045.78] was thinking
[3045.78 → 3046.52] how do
[3046.52 → 3046.90] you live
[3046.90 → 3047.60] like this
[3047.60 → 3048.20] who
[3048.20 → 3049.04] who really
[3049.04 → 3049.86] lives like
[3049.86 → 3050.22] this
[3050.22 → 3050.52] you know
[3050.52 → 3051.28] nothing
[3051.28 → 3051.82] else I
[3051.82 → 3052.12] desire
[3052.12 → 3053.42] and in
[3053.42 → 3053.68] fact
[3053.68 → 3054.22] that's
[3054.22 → 3054.94] an okay
[3054.94 → 3055.30] thing
[3055.30 → 3055.52] you know
[3055.52 → 3055.96] there's
[3055.96 → 3056.68] good stuff
[3056.68 → 3057.04] but then
[3057.04 → 3057.24] there's
[3057.24 → 3057.74] other stuff
[3057.74 → 3058.18] that people
[3058.18 → 3058.90] I think
[3058.90 → 3059.54] all the
[3059.54 → 3060.42] consumerism
[3060.42 → 3060.88] and just
[3060.88 → 3061.82] the desires
[3061.82 → 3062.42] out there
[3062.42 → 3063.78] and some
[3063.78 → 3064.12] things that
[3064.12 → 3064.56] are not
[3064.56 → 3064.94] good
[3064.94 → 3065.32] and not
[3065.32 → 3065.86] healthy
[3065.86 → 3066.52] and are
[3066.52 → 3066.86] really
[3066.86 → 3067.34] in
[3067.34 → 3068.92] almost
[3068.92 → 3069.48] rejection
[3069.48 → 3069.84] of God
[3069.84 → 3070.52] unfaithful
[3070.52 → 3070.90] to God
[3070.90 → 3071.18] and
[3071.18 → 3073.52] nothing
[3073.52 → 3073.94] else
[3073.94 → 3074.16] I
[3074.16 → 3074.70] desire
[3074.70 → 3076.36] who
[3076.36 → 3076.72] really
[3076.72 → 3077.06] lives
[3077.06 → 3077.36] like
[3077.36 → 3077.84] this
[3077.84 → 3078.78] and
[3078.78 → 3078.98] this
[3078.98 → 3079.16] is
[3079.16 → 3079.42] where
[3079.42 → 3079.64] I
[3079.64 → 3079.90] think
[3079.90 → 3081.90] Jesus
[3081.90 → 3082.40] is the
[3082.40 → 3082.58] one
[3082.58 → 3082.76] who
[3082.76 → 3083.14] fulfills
[3083.14 → 3083.58] scripture
[3083.58 → 3084.76] way more
[3084.76 → 3084.96] than
[3084.96 → 3085.30] any
[3085.30 → 3085.68] of us
[3085.68 → 3086.00] ever
[3086.00 → 3086.54] do
[3086.54 → 3086.78] and
[3086.78 → 3087.02] will
[3087.02 → 3088.20] he's
[3088.20 → 3088.34] the
[3088.34 → 3088.58] one
[3088.58 → 3089.02] he's
[3089.02 → 3089.12] the
[3089.12 → 3089.28] one
[3089.28 → 3089.40] who
[3089.40 → 3089.92] really
[3089.92 → 3090.54] lives
[3090.54 → 3090.86] this
[3090.86 → 3091.22] out
[3091.22 → 3092.62] this
[3092.62 → 3093.56] devotion
[3093.56 → 3094.46] to his
[3094.46 → 3094.84] father
[3094.84 → 3095.68] total
[3095.68 → 3096.56] devotion
[3096.56 → 3097.28] to his
[3097.28 → 3097.62] father
[3097.62 → 3099.22] but
[3099.22 → 3099.66] nonetheless
[3099.66 → 3100.36] how do
[3100.36 → 3100.68] we
[3100.68 → 3101.14] grow
[3101.14 → 3101.48] into
[3101.48 → 3101.82] that
[3101.82 → 3102.18] as
[3102.18 → 3102.66] God's
[3102.66 → 3103.02] people
[3103.02 → 3104.90] and
[3104.90 → 3105.20] the
[3105.20 → 3105.56] best
[3105.56 → 3106.02] analogy
[3106.02 → 3106.18] of
[3106.18 → 3106.36] how
[3106.36 → 3106.46] to
[3106.46 → 3106.94] understand
[3106.94 → 3107.20] this
[3107.20 → 3107.66] because
[3107.66 → 3108.12] you know
[3108.12 → 3108.46] there are
[3108.46 → 3108.74] things
[3108.74 → 3108.92] I
[3108.92 → 3109.38] desire
[3109.38 → 3109.66] and
[3109.66 → 3110.06] there's
[3110.06 → 3110.70] good
[3110.70 → 3111.14] stuff
[3111.14 → 3111.30] on
[3111.30 → 3111.48] this
[3111.48 → 3111.76] earth
[3111.76 → 3113.30] is
[3113.30 → 3113.60] the
[3113.60 → 3114.18] analogy
[3114.18 → 3114.38] of
[3114.38 → 3114.80] marriage
[3114.80 → 3117.06] you know
[3117.06 → 3117.92] in
[3117.92 → 3118.18] this
[3118.18 → 3118.60] world
[3118.60 → 3119.22] there
[3119.22 → 3119.74] are
[3119.74 → 3120.44] I'm
[3120.44 → 3120.54] a
[3120.54 → 3120.80] man
[3120.80 → 3121.02] and
[3121.02 → 3121.16] there
[3121.16 → 3121.24] are
[3121.24 → 3121.34] a
[3121.34 → 3121.50] lot
[3121.50 → 3121.60] of
[3121.60 → 3121.76] other
[3121.76 → 3122.00] women
[3122.00 → 3122.48] about
[3122.48 → 3122.82] half
[3122.82 → 3123.02] the
[3123.02 → 3123.44] world
[3123.44 → 3124.04] actually
[3124.04 → 3124.32] probably
[3124.32 → 3124.56] a little
[3124.56 → 3124.74] bit
[3124.74 → 3124.90] more
[3124.90 → 3125.02] than
[3125.02 → 3125.22] that
[3125.22 → 3126.70] but
[3126.70 → 3126.94] in
[3126.94 → 3127.24] another
[3127.24 → 3127.84] sense
[3127.84 → 3128.76] for
[3128.76 → 3129.10] me
[3129.10 → 3129.40] in
[3129.40 → 3129.60] my
[3129.60 → 3129.92] life
[3129.92 → 3131.00] there's
[3131.00 → 3131.24] only
[3131.24 → 3131.60] one
[3131.60 → 3134.14] only
[3134.14 → 3134.54] one
[3134.54 → 3137.18] and
[3137.18 → 3137.40] that's
[3137.40 → 3137.58] where
[3137.58 → 3137.92] I think
[3137.92 → 3138.08] the
[3138.08 → 3138.28] Old
[3138.28 → 3138.56] Testament
[3138.56 → 3139.14] picks up
[3139.14 → 3139.52] on that
[3139.52 → 3139.88] picture
[3139.88 → 3140.18] that
[3140.18 → 3140.58] analogy
[3140.58 → 3140.82] of
[3140.82 → 3141.00] the
[3141.00 → 3141.48] marriage
[3141.48 → 3142.24] with
[3142.24 → 3142.60] God
[3142.60 → 3143.48] between
[3143.48 → 3143.84] God
[3143.84 → 3144.04] and
[3144.04 → 3144.20] his
[3144.20 → 3144.56] people
[3144.56 → 3146.16] hey
[3146.16 → 3147.82] ultimately
[3147.82 → 3149.46] there's
[3149.46 → 3149.64] no
[3149.64 → 3149.98] other
[3149.98 → 3151.96] it's
[3151.96 → 3152.62] only
[3152.62 → 3154.30] our
[3154.30 → 3154.66] Lord
[3154.66 → 3158.38] and
[3158.38 → 3158.90] learning
[3158.90 → 3159.24] to
[3159.24 → 3159.82] live
[3159.82 → 3160.10] like
[3160.10 → 3160.66] that
[3160.66 → 3161.18] in
[3161.18 → 3161.54] a
[3161.54 → 3163.06] lifelong
[3163.06 → 3163.66] process
[3163.66 → 3163.92] it's
[3163.92 → 3164.12] something
[3164.12 → 3164.34] we
[3164.34 → 3164.62] grow
[3164.62 → 3164.92] into
[3164.92 → 3165.18] and
[3165.18 → 3165.78] we
[3165.78 → 3166.18] develop
[3166.18 → 3166.54] more
[3166.54 → 3166.68] and
[3166.68 → 3166.88] more
[3166.88 → 3167.02] in
[3167.02 → 3167.20] but
[3167.20 → 3167.48] that
[3167.48 → 3168.26] sense
[3168.26 → 3168.44] of
[3168.44 → 3169.16] there
[3169.16 → 3169.40] is
[3169.40 → 3169.84] no
[3169.84 → 3170.54] other
[3170.54 → 3171.60] for
[3171.60 → 3172.10] me
[3172.10 → 3175.52] and
[3175.52 → 3175.74] again
[3175.74 → 3176.02] I think
[3176.02 → 3176.34] this is
[3176.34 → 3176.76] especially
[3176.76 → 3177.08] true
[3177.08 → 3177.46] for us
[3177.46 → 3177.58] in
[3177.58 → 3177.70] the
[3177.70 → 3177.98] person
[3177.98 → 3178.16] of
[3178.16 → 3178.64] Jesus
[3178.64 → 3180.54] Jesus
[3180.54 → 3181.58] the
[3181.58 → 3181.98] true
[3181.98 → 3182.88] sanctuary
[3182.88 → 3184.18] the
[3184.18 → 3184.58] true
[3184.58 → 3185.18] temple
[3185.18 → 3185.82] the
[3185.82 → 3186.30] true
[3186.30 → 3187.30] God
[3187.30 → 3188.06] with
[3188.06 → 3189.16] us
[3189.16 → 3192.24] he
[3192.24 → 3192.92] is
[3192.92 → 3193.92] God
[3193.92 → 3194.18] with
[3194.18 → 3194.56] us
[3194.56 → 3197.52] and
[3197.52 → 3197.78] that's
[3197.78 → 3198.12] why
[3198.12 → 3199.66] Colossians
[3199.66 → 3200.04] 3
[3200.04 → 3201.32] I love
[3201.32 → 3201.54] that
[3201.54 → 3202.28] passage
[3202.28 → 3202.62] and it's
[3202.62 → 3203.08] a familiar
[3203.08 → 3203.60] passage
[3203.60 → 3204.06] the beginning
[3204.06 → 3204.26] of
[3204.26 → 3204.88] Colossians
[3204.88 → 3205.26] chapter
[3205.26 → 3205.70] 3
[3205.70 → 3207.80] since
[3207.80 → 3208.30] then
[3208.30 → 3208.90] you
[3208.90 → 3209.20] have
[3209.20 → 3209.48] been
[3209.48 → 3210.10] raised
[3210.10 → 3210.48] with
[3210.48 → 3211.06] Christ
[3211.06 → 3212.44] set
[3212.44 → 3212.72] your
[3212.72 → 3213.06] heart
[3213.06 → 3213.34] on
[3213.34 → 3213.66] things
[3213.66 → 3214.10] above
[3214.10 → 3215.10] where
[3215.10 → 3215.60] Christ
[3215.60 → 3216.04] is
[3216.04 → 3217.18] seated
[3217.18 → 3217.44] at
[3217.44 → 3217.60] the
[3217.60 → 3217.88] right
[3217.88 → 3218.18] hand
[3218.18 → 3218.34] of
[3218.34 → 3218.58] God
[3218.58 → 3219.16] set
[3219.16 → 3219.40] your
[3219.40 → 3219.90] minds
[3219.90 → 3220.24] on
[3220.24 → 3220.68] things
[3220.68 → 3221.04] above
[3221.04 → 3221.30] not
[3221.30 → 3221.50] on
[3221.50 → 3221.94] earthly
[3221.94 → 3222.54] things
[3222.54 → 3224.06] for
[3224.06 → 3224.24] you
[3224.24 → 3224.78] died
[3224.78 → 3226.40] and
[3226.40 → 3226.56] your
[3226.56 → 3227.02] life
[3227.02 → 3227.40] is
[3227.40 → 3227.64] now
[3227.64 → 3228.16] hidden
[3228.16 → 3228.82] with
[3228.82 → 3229.48] Christ
[3229.48 → 3230.36] in
[3230.36 → 3230.80] God
[3230.80 → 3231.76] when
[3231.76 → 3232.28] Christ
[3232.28 → 3232.74] who
[3232.74 → 3233.26] is
[3233.26 → 3233.58] your
[3233.58 → 3234.24] life
[3234.24 → 3235.06] appears
[3235.06 → 3236.48] then
[3236.48 → 3236.70] you
[3236.70 → 3237.12] also
[3237.12 → 3237.50] will
[3237.50 → 3237.90] appear
[3237.90 → 3238.84] with
[3238.84 → 3239.16] him
[3239.16 → 3239.92] in
[3239.92 → 3240.36] glory
[3240.36 → 3241.74] what
[3241.74 → 3241.84] a
[3241.84 → 3242.12] great
[3242.12 → 3242.70] promise
[3242.70 → 3244.42] but
[3244.42 → 3244.54] you
[3244.54 → 3244.68] know
[3244.68 → 3245.32] ultimately
[3245.32 → 3247.64] it's
[3247.64 → 3247.84] still
[3247.84 → 3248.18] God
[3248.18 → 3248.32] who
[3248.32 → 3248.48] has
[3248.48 → 3248.62] to
[3248.62 → 3248.78] do
[3248.78 → 3249.00] this
[3249.00 → 3249.16] in
[3249.16 → 3249.34] us
[3249.34 → 3249.60] isn't
[3249.60 → 3249.80] it
[3249.80 → 3250.76] it's
[3250.76 → 3251.42] God
[3251.42 → 3251.78] who
[3251.78 → 3252.02] has
[3252.02 → 3252.20] to
[3252.20 → 3252.42] bring
[3252.42 → 3252.66] that
[3252.66 → 3253.18] change
[3253.18 → 3253.48] about
[3253.48 → 3254.34] just
[3254.34 → 3254.66] one
[3254.66 → 3254.86] more
[3254.86 → 3255.10] little
[3255.10 → 3255.42] verse
[3255.42 → 3255.60] here
[3255.60 → 3255.80] it's
[3255.80 → 3256.24] interesting
[3256.24 → 3256.46] in
[3256.46 → 3256.64] verse
[3256.64 → 3257.08] 20
[3257.08 → 3258.18] in
[3258.18 → 3258.42] this
[3258.42 → 3259.04] in
[3259.04 → 3259.26] this
[3259.26 → 3260.10] psalm
[3260.10 → 3260.94] the
[3260.94 → 3261.32] NIV
[3261.32 → 3262.12] unfortunately
[3262.12 → 3262.92] does a
[3262.92 → 3263.34] bit of
[3263.34 → 3264.58] editorializing
[3264.58 → 3264.78] here
[3264.78 → 3265.00] and I
[3265.00 → 3265.12] think
[3265.12 → 3265.26] they
[3265.26 → 3265.44] make
[3265.44 → 3265.54] a
[3265.54 → 3266.06] mistake
[3266.06 → 3267.12] in
[3267.12 → 3267.38] verse
[3267.38 → 3267.98] 20
[3267.98 → 3268.20] they
[3268.20 → 3268.62] say
[3268.62 → 3269.32] it's
[3269.32 → 3269.56] talking
[3269.56 → 3269.82] about
[3269.82 → 3270.00] the
[3270.00 → 3270.22] wicked
[3270.22 → 3270.46] and then
[3270.46 → 3270.60] they
[3270.60 → 3270.80] say
[3270.80 → 3271.28] they
[3271.28 → 3271.70] are
[3271.70 → 3272.02] like
[3272.02 → 3272.22] a
[3272.22 → 3272.66] dream
[3272.66 → 3272.92] when
[3272.92 → 3273.24] one
[3273.24 → 3273.86] awakes
[3273.86 → 3274.30] when
[3274.30 → 3274.44] you
[3274.44 → 3274.76] arise
[3274.76 → 3275.00] Lord
[3275.00 → 3275.22] now
[3275.22 → 3275.38] the
[3275.38 → 3275.94] Hebrew
[3275.94 → 3276.40] literally
[3276.40 → 3276.82] just
[3276.82 → 3277.22] says
[3277.22 → 3278.44] like
[3278.44 → 3278.76] a
[3278.76 → 3279.52] dream
[3279.52 → 3279.96] when
[3279.96 → 3280.32] one
[3280.32 → 3280.88] awakes
[3280.88 → 3281.54] you
[3281.54 → 3282.40] arise
[3282.40 → 3283.08] Lord
[3283.08 → 3284.08] God
[3284.08 → 3284.14] and
[3284.14 → 3284.70] God

[3288.82 → 3293.26] wake up
[3293.26 → 3294.76] arise
[3294.76 → 3296.16] and
[3296.16 → 3296.42] when
[3296.42 → 3297.10] God
[3297.10 → 3297.58] brings
[3297.58 → 3297.80] that
[3297.80 → 3298.22] about
[3298.22 → 3299.24] when
[3299.24 → 3299.76] God
[3299.76 → 3300.10] does
[3300.10 → 3300.32] his
[3300.32 → 3300.70] work
[3300.70 → 3301.76] then
[3301.76 → 3302.78] then
[3302.78 → 3303.04] we
[3303.04 → 3303.26] can

[3903.66 → 3904.28] family
[3904.28 → 3905.46] as
[3905.46 → 3905.62] they
[3905.62 → 3906.08] remember
[3906.08 → 3906.52] Annie

[3907.82 → 3908.06] this

[3911.74 → 3911.96] they
[3911.96 → 3912.16] be
[3912.16 → 3912.54] certain
[3912.54 → 3912.90] that
[3912.90 → 3913.14] although
[3913.14 → 3913.56] grief
[3913.56 → 3913.80] is
[3913.80 → 3914.04] never
[3914.04 → 3914.36] done
[3914.36 → 3915.04] we
[3915.04 → 3915.24] look
[3915.24 → 3915.56] forward
[3915.56 → 3915.74] to

[3915.88 → 3916.26] promised
[3916.26 → 3916.80] future
[3916.80 → 3917.26] that
[3917.26 → 3917.40] will
[3917.40 → 3917.64] one
[3917.64 → 3917.80] day
[3917.80 → 3918.28] dissolve
[3918.28 → 3918.62] all
[3918.62 → 3919.10] suffering
[3919.10 → 3919.46] and
[3919.46 → 3919.82] sorrow
[3919.82 → 3921.90] finally
[3921.90 → 3922.28] lord
[3922.28 → 3922.46] we
[3922.46 → 3922.78] pray
[3922.78 → 3922.98] a
[3922.98 → 3923.34] blessing
[3923.34 → 3923.66] on
[3923.66 → 3923.94] Edward
[3923.94 → 3924.16] and
[3924.16 → 3924.44] Joyce
[3924.44 → 3924.68] who
[3924.68 → 3924.88] have
[3924.88 → 3925.14] left
[3925.14 → 3925.38] us
[3925.38 → 3925.56] for
[3925.56 → 3925.88] greener
[3925.88 → 3926.30] pastures
[3926.30 → 3926.48] on
[3926.48 → 3926.62] the
[3926.62 → 3927.00] island
[3927.92 → 3932.82] Keep them, give them joy in their new home and a strong fellowship of believers.
[3934.20 → 3937.74] Now, as we leave this hour we've spent in your presence,
[3938.24 → 3944.50] may others see that we've been with Jesus, in whose precious name we pray. Amen.
[3957.00 → 3965.96] Yes, you can rise. I meant to mention earlier, and I forgot,
[3967.04 → 3971.68] many of you will remember Reverend Dresselheis, who was the first chaplain.
[3972.02 → 3975.02] His wife, Mina, passed away this past Monday.
[3975.56 → 3978.62] So remember the Dresselheis family as well in your prayers.
[3980.26 → 3986.08] Hear this word of parting blessing from the psalmist again, Psalm 134.
[3987.32 → 3992.72] Praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord who minister by night in the house of the Lord.
[3992.90 → 3996.26] Lift your hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord.
[3996.84 → 4003.56] May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who is the maker of heaven and earth.
[4004.06 → 4004.50] Amen.
[4017.00 → 4032.46] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[4032.46 → 4047.26] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4047.26 → 4059.32] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever. Amen.
[4059.32 → 4072.22] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever. Amen.
[4072.22 → 4086.66] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[4086.66 → 4101.46] My friends, may you grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4101.46 → 4113.46] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever. Amen.
[4113.46 → 4126.42] To God be the glory, now and forever, now and forever. Amen.

[4135.02 → 4138.06] Amen.
[4138.06 → 4142.14] Amen.
[4142.14 → 4144.02] Amen.
[4144.02 → 4145.02] Amen.
[4174.02 → 4175.02] Amen.
