[303.50 → 305.72] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[305.88 → 310.82] Welcome to worship at Lanner Christian Reformed Church on this Pentecost Sunday.
[311.22 → 314.98] This day marks the birth of the church.
[315.56 → 323.62] It's the day when the Spirit of God came in power, when the gospel was proclaimed miraculously
[323.62 → 329.48] in all of these different languages, and when thousands were saved and were added to the
[329.48 → 335.10] church, and then they were sent out as witnesses to the ends of the earth.
[336.42 → 342.24] And as a church, we believe that we also are called and bound together by that same Spirit.
[343.34 → 351.62] So even while we are still separated, even across this digital divide, the Holy Spirit who gave
[351.62 → 356.10] birth to the church even now binds us together.
[356.10 → 364.74] And so we come together, even wherever we are seated, we come together to worship our Lord this morning.
[365.72 → 368.98] Today, our designated offering is for Resonate Global Mission.
[369.98 → 376.74] And part of our worship is to give our tithes and offerings to the Lord to support the work of the gospel
[376.74 → 380.06] here in Lanner, but also throughout the whole world.
[380.96 → 384.52] And so you could give online on our website.
[384.68 → 386.74] You could also mail in or drop off a check.
[388.10 → 392.00] And so let's prepare our hearts this morning to come before the Lord in worship.
[392.20 → 400.00] And we hear the call of worship describing the fulfillment of Pentecost in the book of Revelation.
[400.00 → 402.28] So we'll have the words on the screen for you.
[402.68 → 405.08] And where it says all, please read it out loud.
[409.82 → 415.68] After this, I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count,
[416.02 → 423.50] from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.
[423.50 → 428.88] They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.
[429.82 → 432.74] And they cried out in a loud voice,
[433.80 → 439.36] Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[440.04 → 441.26] Let's pray together.
[443.02 → 449.58] Lord Jesus, promised Holy Spirit, glorious Heavenly Father,
[449.58 → 454.94] Father, we praise you that you are a God that is worthy, immensely worthy,
[455.60 → 457.26] of all of our praises.
[458.04 → 461.24] The praises of your people and the praises of your creation.
[462.08 → 468.00] We praise you as the God who calls those who are weak and weary to come to you.
[468.40 → 471.24] That we would find strength, that we would find grace,
[471.82 → 473.96] and that we would find rest and hope.
[475.02 → 477.34] And so, Lord, we do place our hope in you,
[477.34 → 479.10] our mighty God.
[480.18 → 481.74] We pray that this morning,
[482.46 → 485.54] that you would be glorified in our hearts,
[485.94 → 487.84] with our lips, and with our lives.
[488.36 → 489.72] We pray in Jesus' name.
[490.66 → 491.04] Amen.
[492.32 → 494.34] So God greets us with these words,
[494.44 → 496.58] continuing on in Revelation chapter 7.
[497.20 → 497.58] It says,
[497.58 → 498.58] Let us praise and glory,
[499.42 → 499.90] and wisdom,
[500.42 → 501.00] and thanks,
[501.54 → 502.08] and honour,
[502.52 → 503.00] and power,
[503.12 → 503.90] and strength,
[504.54 → 505.62] be to our God,
[506.04 → 507.14] forever and ever.
[507.84 → 508.24] Amen.
[508.24 → 508.32] Amen.
[508.32 → 526.16] Come away from Russian hurry,
[526.16 → 530.32] to the stillness of God's peace.
[530.32 → 534.58] From our vain ambition's worry,
[535.08 → 538.78] come to Christ to find release.
[539.36 → 543.28] Come away from noise and clamour,
[543.76 → 547.58] life's demands and frenzies please.
[548.08 → 551.94] Come to join the people gathered,
[551.94 → 553.94] in the pastures of God's goodness.
[553.94 → 561.94] In the pastures of God's goodness,
[563.14 → 566.90] we lie down to rest our soul.
[567.28 → 571.36] From the waters of God's mercy,
[571.78 → 574.94] we drink deeply, are made whole.
[576.16 → 580.14] At the tables of God's presence,
[580.14 → 584.26] all the saints are richly fed.
[584.26 → 588.26] With the oil of God's anointing,
[589.26 → 593.26] each whose service we are led.
[595.66 → 597.38] Come, there are children,
[598.04 → 599.26] with your burdens,
[600.20 → 603.26] lives, confusions, fears, and pains.
[604.34 → 608.12] Leave them at the cross of Jesus,
[608.12 → 612.32] take and stay His kingdom's reign.
[613.04 → 614.46] Bring your thirst,
[614.58 → 616.94] for He will quench them,
[617.30 → 620.36] He alone will satisfy.
[621.44 → 623.12] All our longings,
[623.96 → 625.12] find attainment,
[626.20 → 629.94] when to self we gladly die.
[629.94 → 646.62] with thanks to the Lord,
[646.62 → 648.70] our God and King,
[649.06 → 652.12] His love enjoys forever.
[652.12 → 655.50] For He is good,
[655.50 → 657.96] He is an unlawful thing,
[658.46 → 661.44] His love enjoys forever.
[661.44 → 665.52] Sing praise,
[665.52 → 670.82] sing praise.
[670.82 → 676.18] With the mighty hand and outstretched arm,
[676.70 → 679.64] His love enjoys forever.
[679.64 → 687.50] The Lord my faithfulness,
[688.00 → 688.02] and belonging to the Father.
[688.02 → 688.44] It's a prayer,
[688.44 → 689.16] in their love,
[689.16 → 689.58] His love of love,
[689.58 → 690.36] his love of love.
[690.36 → 691.50] It is not for heaven,
[691.50 → 692.40] for yet next will be a grace,
[692.40 → 706.98] Sing praise, sing praise, sing praise
[706.98 → 711.60] Forever God is faithful
[711.60 → 716.58] Forever God is strong
[716.58 → 721.66] Forever God is with us
[721.66 → 727.74] Forever, forever
[727.74 → 740.36] From the rising tune and the setting sun
[740.36 → 743.94] His love endures forever
[743.94 → 749.68] For the grace of love He will carry on
[749.68 → 753.16] His love endures forever
[753.16 → 761.60] Sing praise, sing praise
[761.60 → 769.76] Sing praise, sing praise
[769.76 → 775.84] Forever God is faithful
[775.84 → 780.24] Forever God is strong
[780.24 → 785.64] Forever God is with us
[785.64 → 786.84] Forever
[786.84 → 793.92] Forever God is faithful
[793.92 → 798.76] Forever God is strong
[798.76 → 804.12] Forever God is with us
[804.12 → 804.92] Forever
[804.92 → 808.92] Forever
[808.92 → 814.40] Forever
[814.40 → 820.08] Today is another very special day
[820.08 → 822.44] Because we will be having another baptism
[822.44 → 824.28] In this season of Easter
[824.28 → 825.80] It's the last Sunday of Easter
[825.80 → 827.98] So we have a chance for one more baptism
[827.98 → 829.46] On this Pentecost Sunday
[829.46 → 832.52] And so we will introduce you to Zara Lee in a moment
[832.52 → 836.30] But before we do so
[836.30 → 837.96] I thought this would be a good opportunity
[837.96 → 841.44] For us to profess our faith as a church
[841.44 → 845.18] And renew our own baptismal covenant
[845.18 → 849.80] And so we will do that by saying the Apostles' Creed together
[849.80 → 852.38] And we'll have the words here on the screen
[852.38 → 856.08] So we'll do it in a question and answer format
[856.08 → 858.96] So brothers and sisters
[858.96 → 860.62] Do you believe in God the Father?
[862.24 → 864.94] I believe in God the Father Almighty
[864.94 → 867.74] Creator of heaven and earth
[867.74 → 870.82] Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
[871.66 → 873.64] I believe in Jesus Christ
[873.64 → 875.54] His only Son, our Lord
[875.54 → 877.84] Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
[877.84 → 879.52] And born of the Virgin Mary
[879.52 → 881.96] He suffered under Pontius Pilate
[881.96 → 884.70] Was crucified, died, and was buried
[884.70 → 886.46] He descended to hell
[886.46 → 889.34] The third day he rose again from the dead
[889.34 → 890.94] He ascended to heaven
[890.94 → 894.80] And is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty
[894.80 → 897.74] From there he will come to judge
[897.74 → 899.84] The living and the dead
[899.84 → 903.92] Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?
[904.80 → 906.98] I believe in the Holy Spirit
[906.98 → 909.06] The Holy Catholic Church
[909.06 → 911.00] The communion of saints
[911.00 → 913.02] The forgiveness of sins
[913.02 → 914.84] The resurrection of the body
[914.84 → 916.86] And the life everlasting
[916.86 → 918.18] Amen
[918.18 → 920.64] So now let's meet Zara Li
[920.64 → 922.34] And hear her profession of faith
[922.34 → 925.72] Hi
[925.72 → 925.74] Hi
[925.74 → 926.60] Hi
[926.60 → 926.94] 大家好
[926.94 → 928.24] 我是 Zara
[928.24 → 932.36] 我是2019年的时候
[932.36 → 934.16] 跟儿子来到加拿大的
[934.16 → 937.04] 目前儿子在读中学
[937.04 → 939.12] 我家先生呢
[939.12 → 940.16] 因为工作的原因
[940.16 → 941.54] 在中国
[941.54 → 944.26] 下面我说一下
[944.26 → 946.28] 我是如何信靠上帝的
[946.28 → 947.12] 一个过程
[947.12 → 975.12] Warm?
[975.12 → 1002.18] uh
[1002.18 → 1007.82] Also helped me to arrive at the hospitals
[1007.82 → 1029.10] With Nancy's Viterbi
[1029.10 → 1058.40] Okay.
[1058.40 → 1062.40] After that, I found some strange changes.
[1062.40 → 1067.40] My own personal attitude is better than before,
[1067.40 → 1075.40] more than before, more than before, more than before, more than before.
[1075.40 → 1080.40] I will often discuss my own problems,
[1080.40 → 1084.40] and discuss my own problems.
[1084.40 → 1091.40] After that, I found my own relationship with my own relationship.
[1091.40 → 1095.40] It became more, more and more.
[1095.40 → 1101.40] I think this is my own personal work.
[1101.40 → 1111.40] I also know that the is a very beginning to do my own.
[1111.40 → 1126.40] Youngest place village.
[1126.40 → 1131.40] God's words, read the Bible every day.
[1131.40 → 1133.40] And with the brothers and sisters,
[1133.40 → 1135.40] we pray to God and to worship God,
[1135.40 → 1139.40] and to worship God, and to love God.
[1139.40 → 1144.40] We pray to God's joy and to do it.
[1144.40 → 1148.40] We thank God's choice.
[1148.40 → 1150.40] Thank you, God.
[1156.40 → 1159.40] That was Zara's testimony. She did a wonderful job.
[1159.40 → 1162.40] And here she is in person.
[1162.40 → 1164.40] I guess it's still digital for you.
[1164.40 → 1169.40] So it is a joy today to baptize Zara Li
[1169.40 → 1172.40] and to receive her into our fellowship.
[1178.40 → 1182.40] And so Zara has completed the baptism classes
[1182.40 → 1184.40] with Pastor Nancy.
[1184.40 → 1187.40] And this week she has met with Nancy and myself
[1187.40 → 1191.40] and two of our elders to hear her profession of faith.
[1191.40 → 1195.40] Zara already completed this program with Pastor Nancy.
[1195.40 → 1199.40] And this week she has met with Pastor Jason and me,
[1199.40 → 1201.40] and two of our elders,
[1201.40 → 1205.40] and she has recognized her faith.
[1205.40 → 1207.40] And so brothers and sisters,
[1207.40 → 1210.40] hear the words of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1210.40 → 1215.40] as he instituted the holy sacrament of baptism.
[1215.40 → 1216.40] Jesus said,
[1216.40 → 1218.40] After he rose again from the dead,
[1218.40 → 1221.40] all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1221.40 → 1225.40] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
[1225.40 → 1227.40] baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[1227.40 → 1229.40] and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
[1229.40 → 1233.40] and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.
[1233.40 → 1238.40] And remember I am with you always to the end of the age.
[1238.40 → 1241.40] The Bible is full of instructions about the meaning.
[1241.40 → 1271.40] 
[1271.40 → 1274.40] In the Bible, there are many things about the meaning of the Holy Spirit.
[1274.40 → 1279.40] Baptism is a sign and seal of God's promises to his covenant people.
[1279.40 → 1290.40] In baptism, God promises by grace alone to forgive our sins.
[1290.40 → 1294.40] In baptism, God promises by grace alone to forgive our sins.
[1294.40 → 1300.40] In baptism, He adopts us into the body of Christ, the church.
[1300.40 → 1313.40] He sends the Holy Spirit daily to renew and cleanse us,
[1313.40 → 1315.40] and to resurrect us to eternal life.
[1315.40 → 1322.40] He sends the Holy Spirit daily to eternal life.
[1322.40 → 1326.40] And all these promises are made visible to us in the waters of baptism.
[1326.40 → 1330.40] All of this is all the blessings in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1330.40 → 1335.40] Through baptism, Christ calls us to a new life and a new obedience.
[1335.40 → 1340.40] Through baptism, Jesus calls us to a new life and a new obedience.
[1340.40 → 1344.40] He calls us to love and to trust God completely,
[1344.40 → 1347.40] to forsake the evil of the world and to live a new and holy life.
[1347.40 → 1349.40] He calls us to love and to trust God completely,
[1349.40 → 1355.40] to forsake the evil of the world and to live a new and holy life.
[1355.40 → 1360.40] And yet, when we do fall into sin as we all will as sinners,
[1360.40 → 1365.40] we must not despair of God's mercy nor continue in sin,
[1365.40 → 1371.40] because baptism is a sign and seal of God's eternal covenant of grace with us.
[1371.40 → 1374.40] But because we are all sinners, when we are sinners,
[1374.40 → 1378.40] we cannot be ashamed of the shame of God's mercy and sin.
[1378.40 → 1380.40] We must not be guilty of sin.
[1380.40 → 1386.40] Because the Holy Spirit is the name of God's holy and holy of the eternal grace.
[1386.40 → 1392.40] And so, now we will ask Zahra some vows.
[1392.40 → 1395.40] She has already shared her testimony on the video.
[1395.40 → 1398.40] But we will ask you, Zahra, a few questions.
[1398.40 → 1401.40] 下面我们要问Zahra几个问题。
[1401.40 → 1405.40] 她刚才已经在这个video当中做了一个见证。
[1405.40 → 1408.40] 那现在我们还是请她宣布一些誓言。
[1408.40 → 1415.40] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[1415.40 → 1421.40] 你相信耶稣基督是上帝的儿子被差遣来赎回这个世界的吗?
[1421.40 → 1423.40] 是的, 我信。
[1423.40 → 1429.40] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1429.40 → 1433.40] And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1433.40 → 1439.40] 你是否爱他并相信他是从罪中拯救你的那一位?
[1439.40 → 1443.40] 你是否愿意以悔改和喜乐来拥抱他?
[1443.40 → 1446.40] 是他为你生命的主宰?
[1446.40 → 1448.40] 是的, 我愿意。
[1448.40 → 1453.40] And do you promise to do all you can with the help of the Holy Spirit
[1453.40 → 1455.40] to strengthen your love and your commitment to Christ
[1455.40 → 1458.40] by sharing faithfully in the life of this church?
[1458.40 → 1462.40] 你是否承诺在圣灵的帮助下竭尽所能?
[1462.40 → 1466.40] 通过忠实地来分享这个教会的生活
[1466.40 → 1468.40] 来加强对基督的爱和承诺?
[1468.40 → 1470.40] 是的。
[1470.40 → 1477.40] Okay, and this Sunday we have a vow for you, the congregation.
[1477.40 → 1479.40] And we'll put that on the screen as well.
[1479.40 → 1484.40] 这一周我们也有对慧众的一个誓言要求。
[1484.40 → 1487.40] 在这个屏幕上有。
[1487.40 → 1492.40] And maybe let's count this vow, this is the first time we've done it,
[1492.40 → 1497.40] for not only Zara, but for all those whom we have baptized over these weeks.
[1497.40 → 1502.40] 这个不仅仅是对Zara的, 也是对这几周以来所有的
[1502.40 → 1506.40] 受洗加入基督身体的弟兄姐妹。
[1506.40 → 1511.40] So brothers and sisters, do you, the people of the Lord, promise to receive Zara into your fellowship
[1511.40 → 1513.40] as a member of the body of Christ?
[1513.40 → 1520.40] And do you promise to encourage her in the Christian faith and help her in doing the work of the Lord?
[1520.40 → 1530.40] 弟兄姐妹们, 作为耶和华的子民,你们是否答应接受 Zara作为基督身体的一部分, 加入你们的团契中?
[1530.40 → 1536.40] 你们是否承诺鼓励她的基督信仰并帮助她完成主的工作?
[1536.40 → 1539.40] And so let's all respond again together.
[1539.40 → 1541.40] We do, God helping us.
[1541.40 → 1544.40] 是的, 我们承诺上帝帮助我们。
[1544.40 → 1550.40] Okay, and let's pray for God's presence here with us as we have this baptism.
[1550.40 → 1554.40] 让我们一起祷告, 让上帝临在我们中间。
[1554.40 → 1560.40] We thank you, Father, that by the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus, the living water,
[1560.40 → 1566.40] that he forgives us, frees us from sin and death, and opens the way of life everlasting.
[1566.40 → 1568.40] 天父上帝, 我们感谢赞美你。
[1568.40 → 1574.40] 因耶稣基督这生命的活水, 他的死与复活,您赦免我们。
[1574.40 → 1581.40] 使我们从罪恶和死亡中解脱出来, 并开辟了通往永生的道路。
[1581.40 → 1584.40] We thank you, O God, for the gift of baptism.
[1584.40 → 1589.40] In this water, you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death,
[1589.40 → 1595.40] and are raised to share in his resurrection, and are being renewed by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1595.40 → 1599.40] 上帝啊, 我们感谢赞美你赐下洗礼。
[1599.40 → 1602.40] 在这洗礼的水中, 你向我们确认。
[1602.40 → 1607.40] 我们与耶稣基督一同被埋葬, 受死,被提,
[1607.40 → 1614.40] 来分享他的复活, 并被圣灵的能力更新。
[1614.40 → 1617.40] Send your Holy Spirit, we pray upon Zahra,
[1617.40 → 1622.40] that this water of baptism may be a spring gushing up to eternal life.
[1622.40 → 1628.40] Wash away her sin, raise her to new life, and graft her into the body of Christ.
[1628.40 → 1634.40] 请赐下圣灵, 让我们向Zahra祷告。
[1634.40 → 1639.40] 愿你这受洗的泉水直流到永生。
[1639.40 → 1647.40] 洗尽她的罪过, 使她从获新生,并且将它嫁接到基督的身体上。
[1647.40 → 1652.40] We pray all of this in Jesus' name to the glory of God. Amen.
[1652.40 → 1657.40] 愿一切荣耀归于上帝, 奉耶稣基督的名祈祷。Amen.
[1657.40 → 1666.40] And I think it's especially appropriate on this Pentecost Sunday to be having translation in Mandarin spoken.
[1666.40 → 1671.40] So we will now do the baptism, Zahra.
[1671.40 → 1674.40] 现在我们要说施洗的洗礼。
[1674.40 → 1675.40] Here we go.
[1675.40 → 1687.40] So Zahra, God chose you before the foundation of the world.
[1687.40 → 1693.40] Zahra, 上帝在世界建立以前就已经拣选了你。
[1693.40 → 1696.40] Jesus Christ came into this world for you.
[1696.40 → 1699.40] 耶稣基督来到世上是为了你。
[1699.40 → 1701.40] He lived for you.
[1701.40 → 1702.40] 他为你而活。
[1702.40 → 1704.40] He suffered and died for you.
[1704.40 → 1706.40] 他为你而受苦受死。
[1706.40 → 1708.40] He rose from the dead for you.
[1708.40 → 1710.40] 他死而复活也是为了你。
[1710.40 → 1714.40] He ascended into heaven and poured out his Holy Spirit for you.
[1714.40 → 1715.40] 他生天。
[1715.40 → 1716.40] 他从死里复活。
[1716.40 → 1720.40] 他从死里复活。
[1720.40 → 1725.40] And he promises to come again to bring you into his eternal kingdom.
[1725.40 → 1730.40] 他承诺有一天他会再来, 把你带入他永恒的国度。
[1730.40 → 1735.40] So Zahra, I baptize you in the name of the Father.
[1735.40 → 1742.40] Zahra, 我奉天父、圣子和圣灵的名为你施洗。
[1742.40 → 1743.40] 祝福祿。
[1743.40 → 1744.40] 祝福祭。
[1744.40 → 1745.40] 祝福祭。
[1745.40 → 1747.40] 祝福祭。
[1747.40 → 1748.40] 祝福祭。
[1748.40 → 1750.40] 祝福祭。
[1750.40 → 1751.40] 祝福祭。
[1751.40 → 1752.40] 祝福祭。
[1752.40 → 1753.40] 祝福祭。
[1753.40 → 1755.40] 祝福祭。
[1755.40 → 1756.40] 祝福祭。
[1756.40 → 1758.40] 祝福祭。
[1758.40 → 1760.40] 祝福祭。
[1760.40 → 1761.40] 祝福祭。
[1761.40 → 1765.40] So in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the king and the head of the church,
[1765.40 → 1770.40] Zahra is now received into the membership of the Holy Catholic Church,
[1770.40 → 1776.40] engaged to confess Christ and to be God's faithful servant until the end of life.
[1776.40 → 1781.40] 以耶稣基督的名, 独一的君王,教会的元首的名,
[1781.40 → 1787.40] Zahra has already been joined to the,
[1787.40 → 1793.40] 致力于承认基督 and become the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord.
[1793.40 → 1794.40] 直到生命的尽头。
[1794.40 → 1795.40] 让我们一起祷告。
[1795.40 → 1796.40] 让我们一起祷告。
[1796.40 → 1803.40] Our Father in heaven, we thank you for Jesus Christ, for the new life given in him.
[1803.40 → 1805.40] 我们在天上的父母。
[1805.40 → 1807.40] 我们因耶稣基督感谢你。
[1807.40 → 1810.40] 因他带来的新生命感谢你。
[1810.40 → 1826.40] 我们为你给我们的同一的信仰, 盼望和洗礼,历代圣徒所同详的这个信仰感谢你。
[1826.40 → 1833.40] We rejoice that you have claimed Zahra as your own and that she belongs to you and to your church.
[1833.40 → 1835.40] 我们感谢你。
[1835.40 → 1842.40] 我们开心地看到你接受耶稣基督, 你接受Zahra成为你自己的一部分。
[1842.40 → 1845.40] 它是属于你的, 也是属于你的教会。
[1845.40 → 1847.40] We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.
[1847.40 → 1849.40] 奉耶稣基督的名祷告, Amen.
[1849.40 → 1851.40] Okay, round of applause.
[1851.40 → 1853.40] Thank you.
[1853.40 → 1855.40] Oh, and Zahra.
[1855.40 → 1857.40] Oh, and Zahra, here you are.
[1857.40 → 1859.40] This is your certificate.
[1859.40 → 1861.40] And there's a Bible.
[1861.40 → 1863.40] Thank you very much.
[1863.40 → 1865.40] Okay.
[1885.40 → 1895.40] Holy Spirit, living breath of God.
[1895.40 → 1901.40] Bring you life into my willing soul.
[1901.40 → 1915.40] Bring the presence of the risen Lord to renew my heart and make me whole.
[1915.40 → 1919.40] Cause your heart to come alive in me.
[1919.40 → 1925.40] Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[1925.40 → 1931.40] Give me passion for your purity.
[1931.40 → 1935.40] Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me.
[1935.40 → 1941.40] Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me.
[1941.40 → 1945.40] Holy Spirit, come abide with me.
[1945.40 → 1955.40] May your joy be seen in all our due.
[1955.40 → 1959.40] Love enough to cover every sin.
[1959.40 → 1971.40] In each thought and deed and attitude.
[1971.40 → 1973.40] God is to the greatest and the peace.
[1973.40 → 1978.40] God is to the greatest and the peace.
[1978.40 → 1985.40] Gentleness and souls in path of peace.
[1985.40 → 1992.40] Turn my striving into works of grace.
[1992.40 → 1999.40] With of God show, Christ in all I do.
[1999.40 → 2006.40] Holy Spirit, from creation's birth.
[2006.40 → 2007.40] In Holy Spirit, from salvation's birth.
[2007.40 → 2008.40] Give me love and77 HOUSE, plays fans of God with me.
[2008.40 → 2015.36] As one song for prayer.
[2015.36 → 2021.40] Show your strength once again, O Lord.
[2021.40 → 2028.52] Cause your church to honker for His ways.
[2028.52 → 2037.16] Let the fragrance of our praise arise
[2037.16 → 2043.78] Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[2043.78 → 2051.32] That in unity the face of Christ
[2051.32 → 2057.58] May be before all thou want to see
[2057.58 → 2066.92] Continue to worship the Lord in this time of confession and renewal.
[2067.52 → 2074.76] Because we believe that God the Father Almighty sent His only Son, our Lord, to die for us.
[2075.30 → 2077.78] And He sent His Holy Spirit to fill us.
[2078.60 → 2081.48] We can come to God confessing our sins.
[2082.12 → 2083.04] And so let's pray together.
[2083.04 → 2092.08] Father, we confess to you, our Heavenly Father, and before one another as your body,
[2092.78 → 2096.20] that we have sinned greatly in thought, word, and deed.
[2096.80 → 2099.10] We have offended your holiness.
[2100.12 → 2107.42] We have followed the devices of our own hearts and have spurned the promptings of your Holy Spirit.
[2107.42 → 2112.40] Through our own fault, we have deserved your judgment.
[2114.10 → 2119.56] O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, who takes away the sin of the world,
[2120.06 → 2122.82] have mercy on us and hear our prayer.
[2123.62 → 2123.94] Amen.
[2125.84 → 2128.92] But friends, the Lord has not cast us from His presence,
[2128.92 → 2134.56] but He has cast our sins from us as far as the east is from the west.
[2135.36 → 2141.38] Know then that the Lord your God has freely and fully forgiven your sins.
[2142.06 → 2148.80] And let's sing a song of renewal and thanks, gratitude to God for His grace to us.
[2148.80 → 2171.76] OF doing them wondrous mystery,
[2172.32 → 2176.14] rise their heart upon the tree,
[2176.14 → 2185.42] In this day the fallen sinners has an endless victory.
[2186.68 → 2195.14] See the price of our intention, see the Father's plans unfold.
[2195.14 → 2205.14] Bringing many sons to glory, grace unmeasured love untold.
[2207.14 → 2217.38] Come behold them, wondrous mystery, send my death the God of life.
[2217.38 → 2226.38] But no great could any strength, the risen army is alive.
[2226.38 → 2236.62] What a forty of deliverance, how unmade they make our way.
[2237.22 → 2246.70] Christ in power resurrected, as we will be when he comes.
[2246.70 → 2247.70] Amen.
[2247.70 → 2248.70] Amen.
[2248.70 → 2249.70] Amen.
[2249.70 → 2250.70] Amen.
[2250.70 → 2251.70] Amen.
[2251.70 → 2252.70] Amen.
[2252.70 → 2253.70] Amen.
[2253.70 → 2254.70] Amen.
[2254.70 → 2255.70] Amen.
[2255.70 → 2256.70] Amen.
[2256.70 → 2258.70] Amen.
[2258.70 → 2259.70] Amen.
[2259.70 → 2260.70] Amen.
[2260.70 → 2262.70] Amen.
[2262.70 → 2272.42] In their stead of human sinners, makes the Lamb in victory.
[2273.84 → 2282.22] See the price of our redemption, see their Father's plans unfold.
[2282.22 → 2293.22] Bringing many sons to glory, raised unmeasured love untold.
[2298.90 → 2309.28] Come behold the wondrous mystery, saved by death the God of life.
[2309.28 → 2318.36] But no grace, good and restraining, is the Lord, He is alive.
[2319.00 → 2327.62] What a forty of deliverance, how unwavering our hope.
[2328.24 → 2337.10] Christ in power resurrected, as we will be when He comes.
[2337.10 → 2347.10] What a forty of deliverance, how unwavering our hope.
[2349.10 → 2359.10] Christ in power resurrected, as we will be when He comes.
[2359.10 → 2369.28] So again, today is Pentecost Sunday.
[2370.16 → 2377.42] And that, of course, is the day when there was this amazing outpouring of God's Spirit on His people.
[2377.42 → 2384.34] And that Spirit, when it comes into the lives of a Christian, it changes us in such profound ways.
[2384.64 → 2389.48] And it gives us a whole new identity and a whole new purpose of life.
[2389.48 → 2396.98] So I think it is very fitting that on this Pentecost Sunday, we come to an end of our series called You Are.
[2397.56 → 2400.02] That's reminded us of who we are as Christians.
[2400.64 → 2405.68] And it's reminded us of this new life that we have been brought into.
[2405.68 → 2416.26] So we've been looking at these various titles given to us in God's Word that shape our faith and shape our identity as Christians.
[2416.64 → 2420.76] And actually serve to make us who we are.
[2421.78 → 2430.80] And those titles have included being a disciple of Jesus, where we follow Jesus in our lives and submit to Him.
[2430.80 → 2436.32] Being witnesses to the grace of Jesus in our lives to other people.
[2437.38 → 2443.76] Being servants of God and others as we know that Christ has served us.
[2444.20 → 2446.82] Being children of our loving Heavenly Father.
[2447.32 → 2451.02] And last week we saw how we are members of the body of Christ.
[2451.14 → 2452.38] Members one of another.
[2453.50 → 2460.40] And so today we're going to look at a passage that speaks to our identity of being priests and pilgrims.
[2460.80 → 2461.58] Priests and pilgrims.
[2461.64 → 2463.56] So it's kind of a two for one deal today.
[2464.30 → 2466.52] I couldn't decide which one I wanted to do.
[2466.74 → 2467.42] So we're going to do both.
[2468.86 → 2471.00] So this passage is found in 1 Peter.
[2471.00 → 2475.10] We will read together 1 Peter 2, verses 4-12.
[2476.14 → 2478.92] And please give your attention to the reading of God's Word.
[2478.92 → 2487.46] As you come to Him, the living stone, rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to Him,
[2488.14 → 2496.08] you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood,
[2496.62 → 2501.58] offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[2501.58 → 2505.04] For in Scripture it says,
[2505.04 → 2510.64] See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone,
[2511.26 → 2514.84] and the one who trusts in Him will never be put to shame.
[2515.86 → 2518.70] Now to you who believe, this stone is precious.
[2519.54 → 2525.12] But to those who do not believe, the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[2525.12 → 2531.28] And a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.
[2531.70 → 2536.94] They stumble because they disobey the message, which is also what they were destined for.
[2538.72 → 2546.18] But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[2546.74 → 2552.30] that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wondrous light.
[2552.30 → 2556.12] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[2556.52 → 2559.94] Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[2560.78 → 2568.48] Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[2569.38 → 2573.98] Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[2574.56 → 2580.50] they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits us.
[2580.50 → 2586.98] This is God's word, and He gives it to us to build us up in faith and in hope and in love.
[2587.48 → 2588.28] Let's pray together.
[2590.92 → 2597.08] Father, we come before you in your word seeking to know who we are,
[2597.86 → 2600.50] seeking to know how you have called us to live in this world.
[2600.50 → 2605.20] So, Father, help us to lay aside all the other voices,
[2606.22 → 2612.64] those other stones that we seek to stand upon and help us to stand upon Christ,
[2613.34 → 2614.74] the cornerstone of our lives.
[2615.84 → 2619.72] And Lord, open up our eyes by the work of your Pentecost spirit this morning,
[2620.38 → 2625.50] that you would instruct us and guide us by your word.
[2625.84 → 2627.52] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2627.52 → 2627.60] Amen.
[2629.66 → 2632.64] So, as you are sitting in your homes or wherever you are sitting,
[2633.48 → 2635.38] I want to ask you a question.
[2635.54 → 2639.42] Do you remember the words of someone who cared for you?
[2639.90 → 2647.12] Do you remember words that they might have used to encourage you along the way?
[2647.12 → 2653.96] I think many, you know, probably a lot of us can think to a certain word that was said
[2653.96 → 2658.30] or a certain person who said it at a certain time in our lives
[2658.30 → 2662.70] that really encouraged us and lifted us up.
[2662.84 → 2666.48] And I've been thinking about this recently because of the encouragement I received
[2666.48 → 2671.70] from the professor at Regent College who was supervising my thesis paper.
[2671.70 → 2675.80] And so, he was just encouraging to me all along the way.
[2676.08 → 2679.22] And so, for instance, I sent him a draft of the paper,
[2679.72 → 2682.18] and he just responded in his email,
[2683.06 → 2686.44] Wow! Hero! I can't wait to read it.
[2686.44 → 2689.50] And it wasn't anything profound.
[2689.58 → 2690.86] He hadn't even read my paper yet.
[2690.92 → 2692.62] It could have stunk for all he knew.
[2693.48 → 2694.60] But it was just this,
[2695.68 → 2700.66] it struck me as this encouraging manner of speaking
[2700.66 → 2702.62] that was also from the heart.
[2703.46 → 2704.88] And it lifted me up,
[2704.90 → 2709.60] and it helped me rise to the challenge of finishing the paper.
[2711.18 → 2712.84] And encouragement does that.
[2712.84 → 2717.58] You know, encouragement builds us up to overcome the challenges of life.
[2718.36 → 2725.92] Encouragement reminds us who we are and what we are doing when things seem uncertain.
[2727.22 → 2732.34] And similarly, 1 Peter is a letter that Paul has written
[2732.34 → 2735.88] to encourage people in their faith.
[2736.78 → 2740.22] And this is called one of the Catholic epistles.
[2740.22 → 2744.48] And all that means is that it was widely circulated to all the churches
[2744.48 → 2747.08] in the Roman province of Asia Minor,
[2747.32 → 2751.70] rather than written specifically to a particular church.
[2753.06 → 2755.64] And here, Peter is writing to Christians
[2755.64 → 2761.60] who were suffering hostility and harassment from their neighbours.
[2762.28 → 2766.28] They were making such remarkable changes in their lives
[2766.28 → 2768.02] that people were taking notice,
[2768.60 → 2773.88] and they had become the targets of slander and social ostracism.
[2774.64 → 2778.24] And this is why Peter calls them foreigners and aliens.
[2778.36 → 2782.48] And he refers to them as people in exile and strangers in the world.
[2783.46 → 2786.66] So Peter wrote to encourage them in the midst of these trials
[2786.66 → 2792.34] by reminding them who they are and the calling that they have received
[2792.34 → 2795.14] by the grace of a loving and gracious God.
[2796.52 → 2800.78] And as we read these words written to our brothers and sisters
[2800.78 → 2802.94] in the first century so long ago,
[2803.14 → 2805.42] we know that they were also written to us.
[2805.92 → 2808.04] They were written to encourage us today.
[2808.04 → 2810.42] So as we look at this passage,
[2810.42 → 2816.06] I just want to focus on two titles that we find in this passage,
[2816.06 → 2818.20] not only that tell us who we are,
[2818.48 → 2819.88] but can also encourage us
[2819.88 → 2823.60] as we live for Jesus in this world,
[2823.68 → 2826.98] in this time and place that he has placed us.
[2826.98 → 2833.76] So we're going to look at the titles again of priest and of pilgrim.
[2834.02 → 2838.54] How do we take on this title of a priest first?
[2839.58 → 2840.64] So that's our first point.
[2840.72 → 2843.36] Priest in verse 5 says this,
[2843.50 → 2846.72] You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house
[2846.72 → 2848.54] to be a holy priesthood,
[2849.18 → 2853.02] offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[2853.02 → 2858.46] So now notice here he uses the word stones
[2858.46 → 2861.92] in building in a spiritual house.
[2862.40 → 2865.46] And all of this is referring back to the temple,
[2866.08 → 2870.14] which was the dwelling place of God among his people,
[2870.46 → 2871.96] starting from the Garden of Eden,
[2872.44 → 2874.04] then to the tabernacle,
[2874.52 → 2876.14] then to the temple,
[2876.68 → 2879.62] then to Jesus Christ in the church.
[2880.26 → 2881.84] But this all refers to the temple.
[2881.84 → 2884.96] And then here, Peter declares that they,
[2885.12 → 2886.50] the church of Jesus Christ,
[2886.96 → 2888.94] is being built into a temple,
[2889.10 → 2893.38] that they are becoming the living temple of God.
[2893.74 → 2898.22] They are the place where the Spirit now dwells in this world.
[2899.60 → 2902.44] Notice also that he doesn't say to the church,
[2903.28 → 2906.96] as the temple you have a priesthood.
[2907.70 → 2909.00] But what does he say?
[2909.00 → 2910.34] He says,
[2910.34 → 2910.36] He says,
[2910.74 → 2913.72] You are a royal priesthood.
[2914.90 → 2916.02] What difference does that make?
[2916.12 → 2917.76] It makes all the difference in the world.
[2919.02 → 2920.80] So in ancient times,
[2921.46 → 2925.16] basically every culture had a sense of God,
[2925.26 → 2927.34] they had a sense of the divine.
[2928.16 → 2929.62] And they also knew, though,
[2929.70 → 2931.16] that there was a separation,
[2931.70 → 2932.58] or a chasm,
[2932.72 → 2934.94] or a gap between human beings and God.
[2934.94 → 2938.72] And you needed something to bridge that gap.
[2938.82 → 2941.60] You needed some way to interact
[2941.60 → 2944.08] and to converse with the gods.
[2944.72 → 2947.24] And that's why every culture had temples
[2947.24 → 2950.12] and priests and sacrifices.
[2950.94 → 2953.16] You had temples where you would go to worship.
[2953.56 → 2956.88] You had priests who were the spiritual elite.
[2957.30 → 2960.70] They were these people who were kind of closer to God in some way.
[2960.70 → 2964.14] So they would take your offerings to the gods.
[2964.94 → 2966.80] And so people were very happy about this,
[2967.04 → 2968.86] that they had these priests
[2968.86 → 2972.18] because they could then connect to God
[2972.18 → 2975.10] with their gods on their behalf.
[2976.02 → 2978.22] And so every culture, including Israel,
[2978.78 → 2981.28] had a spiritual elite who would do the ministry.
[2981.28 → 2984.62] So now this is one of the reasons
[2984.62 → 2987.44] why these Christians that Peter is writing to
[2987.44 → 2991.38] were treated with such hostility.
[2991.76 → 2993.98] It's because, you know,
[2994.04 → 2995.24] amidst all of these cultures
[2995.24 → 2997.34] and these religions of the ancient world,
[2997.46 → 2999.48] along comes Christianity.
[3000.44 → 3002.34] And it was totally different
[3002.34 → 3003.96] from all the other religions
[3003.96 → 3005.58] that people had ever known.
[3006.34 → 3009.00] And the Romans even considered Christians
[3009.00 → 3010.44] to be atheists.
[3011.34 → 3014.56] Now, why would Romans consider Christians atheists?
[3015.36 → 3016.28] It's because,
[3016.94 → 3018.30] even like with the Jews,
[3018.42 → 3020.12] even though the Romans thought the Jews
[3020.12 → 3021.58] were kind of strange,
[3022.08 → 3023.40] at least they had a temple,
[3023.86 → 3025.84] at least they had priests and sacrifices.
[3026.10 → 3027.18] We can understand that.
[3028.44 → 3030.70] But the Christians had no temple,
[3031.42 → 3032.56] they had no priests,
[3032.86 → 3033.94] they had no sacrifices.
[3034.44 → 3034.98] So they're like,
[3035.06 → 3037.02] well, what God do you believe in?
[3037.06 → 3038.28] We don't see your religion.
[3039.16 → 3040.46] So if you asked a Christian,
[3040.94 → 3042.04] where is your temple?
[3042.42 → 3043.86] What would a Christian say to you?
[3044.54 → 3046.26] They'd say, well, Jesus is our temple.
[3047.30 → 3047.50] Right?
[3047.56 → 3048.70] The Gospel of John says,
[3048.88 → 3049.24] in Jesus,
[3049.36 → 3050.78] the eternal word of God
[3050.78 → 3053.66] was made flesh and tabernacle,
[3054.24 → 3054.74] templed,
[3054.88 → 3055.92] dwelt among us.
[3056.46 → 3057.60] And then Jesus claims that
[3057.60 → 3058.96] he himself is the true temple.
[3059.06 → 3059.44] He says,
[3059.78 → 3060.68] destroy this temple,
[3060.78 → 3062.28] in three days I will rise it again,
[3062.38 → 3063.20] referring to himself.
[3063.20 → 3066.00] So Jesus is the temple.
[3066.86 → 3067.86] Now when people ask,
[3067.96 → 3069.68] well, who is your priest?
[3070.48 → 3071.52] How would they respond?
[3072.48 → 3072.90] They would say,
[3072.98 → 3073.96] Jesus is our priest.
[3074.60 → 3077.42] He's the one who has interceded for us,
[3078.02 → 3079.72] between us and God.
[3080.46 → 3081.86] And when Jesus died on the cross,
[3081.98 → 3082.92] Matthew tells us
[3082.92 → 3085.06] that the veil in the temple was,
[3085.54 → 3087.78] that was separating the holy place,
[3088.28 → 3090.40] where God dwelt from people,
[3090.40 → 3092.48] it was torn from top to bottom.
[3093.36 → 3094.20] That in Jesus,
[3094.36 → 3094.98] the barrier,
[3095.16 → 3095.68] this gap,
[3095.76 → 3097.34] this chasm between God and humans
[3097.34 → 3098.34] was removed.
[3100.16 → 3101.96] Jesus is the priest.
[3102.96 → 3103.32] Well then,
[3103.38 → 3104.42] how about your sacrifices?
[3105.82 → 3106.74] There aren't any,
[3106.90 → 3108.44] because Jesus has offered
[3108.44 → 3111.14] the final sacrifice for sin.
[3111.94 → 3114.00] So we don't need any more temples,
[3114.30 → 3115.48] we don't need any more priests,
[3115.54 → 3116.64] we don't need any more sacrifices.
[3117.76 → 3118.76] But then Peter,
[3118.76 → 3120.24] here,
[3120.24 → 3120.28] here,
[3120.56 → 3122.30] says that because Jesus
[3122.30 → 3123.58] is the final temple,
[3123.78 → 3125.18] and the final priest,
[3125.28 → 3126.44] and the final sacrifice,
[3127.10 → 3128.06] as we,
[3128.36 → 3130.12] his body on earth,
[3130.16 → 3131.78] are connected to him
[3131.78 → 3132.50] through faith,
[3132.98 → 3134.08] we become the temple.
[3134.76 → 3136.34] We become the priests,
[3136.92 → 3139.12] we are the sacrifices,
[3139.12 → 3140.74] as we live for God
[3140.74 → 3142.06] as a sacrificial offering
[3142.06 → 3143.44] in our lives.
[3144.44 → 3145.40] He says,
[3145.40 → 3146.20] you also,
[3146.20 → 3147.50] like living stones,
[3147.60 → 3148.20] are being built
[3148.20 → 3149.52] into a spiritual house,
[3149.70 → 3150.10] the temple,
[3150.42 → 3151.96] to be a holy priesthood,
[3152.02 → 3152.70] you are the priests,
[3153.12 → 3155.32] offering spiritual sacrifices
[3155.32 → 3156.52] acceptable to God
[3156.52 → 3157.42] through Jesus Christ.
[3158.52 → 3160.08] So in the midst of
[3160.08 → 3161.04] their trials,
[3161.36 → 3162.38] their anxiety,
[3162.54 → 3163.38] their fears,
[3164.18 → 3165.68] Peter wants to encourage them
[3165.68 → 3167.22] in their identity and purpose.
[3167.56 → 3167.96] He says,
[3168.08 → 3169.72] you are the temple of God on earth.
[3170.08 → 3172.14] God dwells among you
[3172.14 → 3173.02] and in you.
[3173.02 → 3174.14] And he says,
[3174.44 → 3175.16] every one of you
[3175.16 → 3176.08] is a priest.
[3176.86 → 3177.92] What is a priest?
[3178.58 → 3179.56] A priest is someone
[3179.56 → 3181.16] who has access to God.
[3181.78 → 3182.60] A priest is someone
[3182.60 → 3184.72] who can commune
[3184.72 → 3185.88] with God directly,
[3186.14 → 3187.80] and a priest is someone
[3187.80 → 3189.30] who draws other people
[3189.30 → 3192.02] in to know God
[3192.02 → 3193.38] and to worship him.
[3194.80 → 3196.32] And that's why Peter says
[3196.32 → 3197.20] in verse 9,
[3197.28 → 3198.32] which we'll have on the screen,
[3199.12 → 3199.52] he says,
[3199.52 → 3201.46] but you are a chosen people,
[3201.96 → 3203.24] a royal priesthood,
[3203.56 → 3204.56] a holy nation,
[3204.74 → 3206.34] God's special possession,
[3206.90 → 3207.96] that you may declare
[3207.96 → 3208.90] the praises of him
[3208.90 → 3209.48] who called you
[3209.48 → 3210.18] out of darkness
[3210.18 → 3211.36] into his wonderful light.
[3212.86 → 3213.72] They are living
[3213.72 → 3214.72] in troubled times,
[3214.82 → 3215.62] but Peter wants
[3215.62 → 3216.30] to remind them
[3216.30 → 3218.90] how loved they are.
[3219.50 → 3220.10] He says,
[3220.16 → 3220.86] you are God's
[3220.86 → 3221.94] special possession.
[3223.04 → 3223.26] Right?
[3223.34 → 3223.88] In this word,
[3223.98 → 3224.80] special possession,
[3224.96 → 3225.92] it's kind of translated
[3225.92 → 3226.38] differently
[3226.38 → 3227.24] in different translations,
[3227.24 → 3228.70] but it's a word
[3228.70 → 3229.60] that basically means
[3229.60 → 3230.10] treasure.
[3230.82 → 3231.58] And it means
[3231.58 → 3234.64] a most treasured possession,
[3234.84 → 3236.26] special treasure.
[3237.42 → 3238.54] So imagine
[3238.54 → 3239.96] that you have
[3239.96 → 3241.62] almost no assets
[3241.62 → 3242.46] to your name.
[3243.84 → 3244.46] But let's say
[3244.46 → 3245.66] a relative comes
[3245.66 → 3246.70] and gives you
[3246.70 → 3248.68] a diamond necklace
[3248.68 → 3249.40] that's worth
[3249.40 → 3250.88] like five million dollars.
[3251.62 → 3252.94] Is that your most
[3252.94 → 3253.88] special possession?
[3254.98 → 3255.58] Probably.
[3255.98 → 3256.30] Yes.
[3256.38 → 3257.08] Let's just say yes.
[3257.08 → 3257.62] That is.
[3257.88 → 3258.48] You have this
[3258.48 → 3259.62] special treasure.
[3259.94 → 3260.98] It's worth more
[3260.98 → 3261.92] than anything else
[3261.92 → 3262.50] put together.
[3263.68 → 3264.66] So what God is saying
[3264.66 → 3266.32] is that you are
[3266.32 → 3267.70] my special possession.
[3268.42 → 3269.44] You are my treasure.
[3269.62 → 3270.72] Like the whole universe
[3270.72 → 3271.26] is mine.
[3271.32 → 3272.12] I made it all.
[3272.72 → 3273.48] The mountains,
[3273.74 → 3274.34] the land,
[3274.74 → 3275.44] the oceans,
[3275.52 → 3276.96] all of it belongs to me.
[3277.12 → 3278.72] And yet out of all of that,
[3278.82 → 3280.54] you are my most
[3280.54 → 3281.84] prized possession.
[3281.84 → 3285.30] And when we know
[3285.30 → 3287.18] how loved we are,
[3287.32 → 3288.80] how special we are
[3288.80 → 3289.42] to God,
[3289.42 → 3291.34] it also gives us
[3291.34 → 3292.78] a whole new purpose
[3292.78 → 3293.40] in life.
[3294.08 → 3294.74] So Peter says,
[3294.84 → 3294.88] well,
[3294.94 → 3296.72] in response to that,
[3298.32 → 3299.00] that you have been
[3299.00 → 3300.36] chosen by God,
[3300.78 → 3301.72] not that you are
[3301.72 → 3302.60] choice people,
[3302.74 → 3303.34] there's a difference,
[3303.44 → 3303.64] right?
[3303.88 → 3305.00] You're not choice people,
[3305.00 → 3305.76] but you are chosen
[3305.76 → 3306.52] by God.
[3306.70 → 3307.22] That means it's
[3307.22 → 3307.86] His grace
[3307.86 → 3308.64] and His mercy,
[3309.96 → 3310.72] that He has made you
[3310.72 → 3311.86] wholly separated,
[3312.46 → 3313.80] part for Him,
[3314.12 → 3315.34] His special possession,
[3315.50 → 3316.18] whom He loves.
[3316.50 → 3317.26] Because of that,
[3317.32 → 3318.46] our response,
[3319.12 → 3319.84] what are we to do?
[3320.02 → 3320.78] We declare
[3320.78 → 3321.92] the praises of God.
[3322.92 → 3324.36] We are to declare
[3324.36 → 3325.64] the character of God,
[3326.44 → 3327.90] the love of God,
[3328.00 → 3329.12] the grace of God,
[3329.44 → 3330.16] His mercy
[3330.16 → 3331.44] that we have received
[3331.44 → 3332.02] that called us
[3332.02 → 3332.72] out of darkness
[3332.72 → 3334.50] into His wonderful light.
[3336.26 → 3337.10] That's what we do.
[3337.10 → 3338.32] We declare God's praises,
[3338.42 → 3339.56] but declaring God's praises
[3339.56 → 3340.72] is not the sum total
[3340.72 → 3342.20] of our response,
[3342.24 → 3342.90] because then
[3342.90 → 3344.68] Peter moves on
[3344.68 → 3345.64] in the next section.
[3346.94 → 3347.64] Peter links
[3347.64 → 3349.22] the worship of our lips
[3349.22 → 3350.56] as we declare God's praises
[3350.56 → 3351.34] as priests.
[3352.42 → 3353.84] As we worship God
[3353.84 → 3354.48] and call others
[3354.48 → 3355.48] to worship Him,
[3356.32 → 3357.48] he then connects that
[3357.48 → 3358.12] to the worship
[3358.12 → 3359.02] of our lives.
[3359.84 → 3360.58] Our faith
[3360.58 → 3362.28] becomes a reality
[3362.28 → 3363.70] to others
[3363.70 → 3364.20] when
[3364.20 → 3365.52] not only do we
[3365.52 → 3366.50] declare it with our lips,
[3366.50 → 3367.24] but we live it out
[3367.24 → 3367.90] in our lives.
[3368.32 → 3369.04] So that leads us
[3369.04 → 3369.90] to the second point,
[3370.02 → 3370.82] the second identity
[3370.82 → 3371.86] that we receive,
[3372.34 → 3373.36] that we are pilgrims.
[3374.60 → 3375.48] So not only
[3375.48 → 3376.36] are we priests,
[3376.72 → 3377.62] we also read
[3377.62 → 3379.12] about our special place
[3379.12 → 3379.92] in the world
[3379.92 → 3381.72] and how we are
[3381.72 → 3382.32] to interact
[3382.32 → 3382.96] with the world
[3382.96 → 3384.04] as pilgrims.
[3384.82 → 3386.00] So the word pilgrim
[3386.00 → 3386.90] is not in this passage,
[3387.06 → 3388.50] but it's often been used
[3388.50 → 3389.70] in the Christian imagination
[3389.70 → 3391.02] to refer to
[3391.02 → 3392.14] what Peter talks about here.
[3392.14 → 3393.74] So in verse 11,
[3394.34 → 3395.70] Peter refers to the Christian
[3395.70 → 3396.84] as a foreigner
[3396.84 → 3398.34] and an exile.
[3399.26 → 3400.00] A foreigner
[3400.00 → 3400.78] and an exile.
[3401.32 → 3401.62] Now,
[3401.68 → 3402.06] what does it mean
[3402.06 → 3402.70] to be a foreigner
[3402.70 → 3403.70] and to be an exile?
[3405.08 → 3405.36] You know,
[3405.42 → 3405.96] if you,
[3406.80 → 3408.60] as maybe Zara did,
[3409.02 → 3409.92] moved from China
[3409.92 → 3411.00] to here in Canada,
[3411.40 → 3413.00] or I came from the U.S.
[3413.00 → 3415.54] and a SIFE came from Africa,
[3415.74 → 3416.30] we come from these
[3416.30 → 3416.98] different places,
[3417.10 → 3417.84] we all kind of
[3417.84 → 3419.32] experience what it means
[3419.32 → 3420.00] to be a foreigner
[3420.00 → 3420.86] and an exile.
[3422.08 → 3422.90] What it means
[3422.90 → 3423.52] is to live
[3423.52 → 3424.80] in a particular country,
[3424.98 → 3425.98] but to be a citizen
[3425.98 → 3426.98] somewhere else.
[3427.68 → 3429.32] So you live in a place,
[3429.88 → 3430.70] but you come from
[3430.70 → 3431.20] somewhere else.
[3431.24 → 3431.60] You come from
[3431.60 → 3432.22] a different culture.
[3432.78 → 3433.66] You come from
[3433.66 → 3434.82] a place where
[3434.82 → 3435.92] they speak a different language,
[3436.16 → 3436.52] where there are
[3436.52 → 3437.70] different cultural norms
[3437.70 → 3438.44] and habits,
[3439.18 → 3440.72] different cultural expectations.
[3441.72 → 3442.32] And as someone
[3442.32 → 3443.20] who is a foreigner
[3443.20 → 3444.94] or someone who is exiled,
[3445.20 → 3446.04] which means you're living
[3446.04 → 3447.10] away from your home,
[3447.52 → 3448.16] it means that
[3448.16 → 3448.76] you will never
[3448.76 → 3450.28] fully feel at home
[3450.28 → 3450.96] in the place
[3450.96 → 3452.14] where you are now
[3452.14 → 3453.20] that you currently call home.
[3454.08 → 3454.60] You'll speak
[3454.60 → 3455.54] with something of an accent.
[3456.44 → 3457.24] You'll live
[3457.24 → 3459.40] by different cultural habits,
[3459.68 → 3460.60] different expectations
[3460.60 → 3461.20] and practices.
[3462.38 → 3463.40] And what's fascinating
[3463.40 → 3463.92] is the way
[3463.92 → 3464.96] that Peter speaks here.
[3465.88 → 3466.74] Peter doesn't say,
[3467.12 → 3467.72] well, you know
[3467.72 → 3469.44] there are some cultures
[3469.44 → 3470.30] and some places
[3470.30 → 3471.12] where you will feel
[3471.12 → 3472.14] perfectly at home
[3472.14 → 3472.88] as a Christian.
[3473.58 → 3474.84] No, that doesn't exist.
[3475.18 → 3475.74] Peter says,
[3475.92 → 3477.24] you are a foreigner
[3477.24 → 3478.56] and an exile.
[3478.76 → 3480.56] regardless of your culture,
[3480.94 → 3482.36] regardless of the time
[3482.36 → 3483.06] and the place
[3483.06 → 3484.18] that you grow up in
[3484.18 → 3485.48] and where you are from,
[3485.82 → 3487.10] you won't fit in
[3487.10 → 3487.98] perfectly
[3487.98 → 3488.98] when you become
[3488.98 → 3489.42] a Christian.
[3490.56 → 3491.46] And notice,
[3491.58 → 3492.72] Peter is not writing
[3492.72 → 3494.26] to ethnic minorities.
[3494.96 → 3495.34] Right?
[3495.38 → 3495.96] He's not writing
[3495.96 → 3496.82] to a specific
[3496.82 → 3497.62] ethnic group
[3497.62 → 3498.66] within the larger
[3498.66 → 3500.44] culture that they're in.
[3501.00 → 3501.72] The Christians
[3501.72 → 3502.42] who are receiving
[3502.42 → 3503.06] this letter
[3503.06 → 3503.96] culturally
[3503.96 → 3505.04] and ethnically
[3505.04 → 3506.64] are the same
[3506.64 → 3507.50] as their neighbours.
[3507.50 → 3508.14] they are Greeks
[3508.14 → 3509.06] living in Greek cities.
[3509.18 → 3509.64] They are Romans
[3509.64 → 3510.72] living in Roman cities.
[3511.30 → 3512.18] So what this means
[3512.18 → 3512.88] is that when you
[3512.88 → 3513.56] become a Christian,
[3513.68 → 3514.42] you become
[3514.42 → 3516.62] wherever you are,
[3516.72 → 3517.32] a foreigner
[3517.32 → 3518.36] and an exile
[3518.36 → 3519.36] in that place.
[3521.76 → 3522.72] So as people
[3522.72 → 3523.64] who live here
[3523.64 → 3524.66] in greater Vancouver,
[3524.94 → 3525.10] right,
[3525.14 → 3526.00] in the lower mainland,
[3526.16 → 3527.30] on the one hand,
[3527.70 → 3528.72] you may have grown up here.
[3529.44 → 3530.56] You may speak
[3530.56 → 3531.40] the language
[3531.40 → 3532.70] with the accent.
[3533.42 → 3534.10] You may
[3534.10 → 3536.08] have gone to school
[3536.08 → 3536.46] here.
[3536.68 → 3537.88] You may have friends
[3537.88 → 3539.00] here.
[3539.12 → 3540.38] You may work here.
[3541.12 → 3542.02] And yet,
[3542.12 → 3543.18] if you don't see
[3543.18 → 3544.10] yourself as
[3544.10 → 3544.78] different
[3544.78 → 3546.08] from what
[3546.08 → 3546.64] the surrounding
[3546.64 → 3547.74] culture values,
[3547.90 → 3548.70] from what the
[3548.70 → 3549.34] surrounding culture
[3549.34 → 3550.42] lives for
[3550.42 → 3551.18] and sees as
[3551.18 → 3552.32] the purpose of life
[3552.32 → 3553.22] and the values
[3553.22 → 3553.90] of life,
[3554.24 → 3554.92] and if you don't
[3554.92 → 3555.88] live in a distinctive
[3555.88 → 3556.52] way,
[3556.70 → 3557.82] you have essentially
[3557.82 → 3559.06] assimilated
[3559.06 → 3559.88] and you don't see
[3559.88 → 3560.72] yourself as a foreigner.
[3560.72 → 3563.38] And what we know
[3563.38 → 3564.64] of the early church
[3564.64 → 3565.68] is that they had
[3565.68 → 3566.90] particular practices
[3566.90 → 3568.06] and particular
[3568.06 → 3569.12] ways of being
[3569.12 → 3570.42] that were very,
[3570.56 → 3571.26] very foreign
[3571.26 → 3572.16] and strange
[3572.16 → 3573.30] and out of place
[3573.30 → 3573.94] compared to
[3573.94 → 3574.74] the surrounding culture.
[3575.16 → 3575.94] So here are a few
[3575.94 → 3576.40] examples.
[3577.08 → 3577.54] For instance,
[3577.66 → 3578.38] in Rome,
[3578.58 → 3579.50] when there were
[3579.50 → 3581.04] the gladiatorial games,
[3581.34 → 3582.22] we know that Christians
[3582.22 → 3583.00] did not attend
[3583.00 → 3583.64] those games.
[3583.80 → 3584.34] Why not?
[3584.52 → 3585.46] Because they were
[3585.46 → 3586.44] enslaved people
[3586.44 → 3587.76] that were
[3587.76 → 3589.92] put in the games
[3589.92 → 3591.12] and, you know,
[3591.16 → 3592.08] sent to be killed.
[3593.54 → 3594.12] Christians were
[3594.12 → 3594.90] against the killing
[3594.90 → 3595.68] of infants
[3595.68 → 3597.32] because in a culture
[3597.32 → 3598.16] of that day,
[3598.32 → 3598.98] it was common
[3598.98 → 3599.52] that if you had
[3599.52 → 3600.24] a child that
[3600.24 → 3601.06] had a physical
[3601.06 → 3601.72] deformity
[3601.72 → 3602.94] or was a gender
[3602.94 → 3603.70] that you did not
[3603.70 → 3604.16] want,
[3604.38 → 3605.34] you might just
[3605.34 → 3605.98] leave it out
[3605.98 → 3606.48] on the street
[3606.48 → 3606.94] to die.
[3607.04 → 3607.58] And so Christians
[3607.58 → 3608.28] would go out
[3608.28 → 3608.86] in the night,
[3609.58 → 3610.66] they would bring
[3610.66 → 3612.32] in these infants
[3612.32 → 3613.68] and raise them
[3613.68 → 3614.54] as their own.
[3615.78 → 3616.54] We know that
[3616.54 → 3617.40] Christians didn't
[3617.40 → 3618.68] serve in the military
[3618.68 → 3620.32] as much as
[3620.32 → 3620.86] they were able
[3620.86 → 3621.48] to because
[3621.48 → 3622.32] of Caesar's
[3622.32 → 3623.76] war of conquest
[3623.76 → 3624.58] of other nations.
[3625.82 → 3626.42] We know that
[3626.42 → 3627.06] Christians in the
[3627.06 → 3627.62] early church
[3627.62 → 3628.20] acknowledged
[3628.20 → 3628.84] and empowered
[3628.84 → 3629.26] women
[3629.26 → 3630.66] in a culture
[3630.66 → 3631.26] where women
[3631.26 → 3632.58] were typically
[3632.58 → 3633.48] marginalized.
[3634.72 → 3635.60] We know that
[3635.60 → 3636.22] Christians held
[3636.22 → 3636.78] to a very
[3636.78 → 3637.94] particular sex
[3637.94 → 3638.42] ethic,
[3638.98 → 3639.48] that sex
[3639.48 → 3640.16] was reserved
[3640.16 → 3641.04] for the context
[3641.04 → 3641.92] of marriage alone.
[3642.60 → 3643.40] And so we read
[3643.40 → 3643.98] these letters
[3643.98 → 3645.14] where people
[3645.14 → 3645.68] are observing
[3645.68 → 3646.26] these Christians
[3646.26 → 3646.86] and how they're
[3646.86 → 3647.50] so generous
[3647.50 → 3648.16] in sharing
[3648.16 → 3648.92] of everything
[3648.92 → 3650.04] but their spouses.
[3650.82 → 3651.50] This is very odd.
[3653.54 → 3654.76] Christians at that time
[3654.76 → 3655.68] were advocates
[3655.68 → 3656.38] for the poor
[3656.38 → 3657.04] and they cared
[3657.04 → 3657.88] for the poor
[3657.88 → 3660.18] and for enslaved people
[3660.18 → 3662.12] which was very odd
[3662.12 → 3662.90] in a culture
[3662.90 → 3664.52] that was very used
[3664.52 → 3665.46] to using power
[3665.46 → 3666.62] to subjugate people.
[3667.68 → 3668.88] And when they gathered
[3668.88 → 3669.88] we know that
[3669.88 → 3670.58] they included
[3670.58 → 3672.00] all races,
[3672.50 → 3673.40] all classes
[3673.40 → 3674.12] of people
[3674.12 → 3675.04] unheard of,
[3675.04 → 3676.58] men and women
[3676.58 → 3677.58] unheard of,
[3678.04 → 3679.34] children and adults
[3679.34 → 3680.08] unheard of,
[3680.52 → 3681.98] all kinds of people
[3681.98 → 3682.66] together
[3682.66 → 3683.62] as the body
[3683.62 → 3684.10] of Christ.
[3684.76 → 3685.78] And they would all
[3685.78 → 3686.82] drink
[3686.82 → 3687.88] from one
[3687.88 → 3688.90] cup
[3688.90 → 3690.08] as a celebrated
[3690.08 → 3691.78] Holy Communion.
[3692.06 → 3692.68] That was
[3692.68 → 3693.34] scandalous
[3693.34 → 3693.74] as well.
[3695.08 → 3695.84] And perhaps
[3695.84 → 3696.76] what was most
[3696.76 → 3697.48] scandalous
[3697.48 → 3698.50] was the belief
[3698.50 → 3699.38] that there was only
[3699.38 → 3700.02] one way
[3700.02 → 3700.62] of salvation.
[3701.72 → 3702.34] Christians believed
[3702.34 → 3702.90] that there was only
[3702.90 → 3703.68] one true God
[3703.68 → 3704.22] in one way
[3704.22 → 3704.80] of salvation,
[3705.36 → 3707.08] not a separate God
[3707.08 → 3707.78] for every different
[3707.78 → 3708.42] ethnic group,
[3708.64 → 3709.50] not a bunch
[3709.50 → 3710.10] of gods,
[3710.66 → 3711.76] but one God
[3711.76 → 3713.08] for all people,
[3713.54 → 3714.56] all were invited
[3714.56 → 3715.40] to worship Him.
[3716.80 → 3717.92] So all of these
[3717.92 → 3718.78] things made
[3718.78 → 3719.52] Christians
[3719.52 → 3720.74] foreigners
[3720.74 → 3722.06] and exiles.
[3722.74 → 3723.50] And in fact,
[3723.60 → 3724.30] those things
[3724.30 → 3725.74] continue to make
[3725.74 → 3726.40] Christians foreigners
[3726.40 → 3727.12] and exiles
[3727.12 → 3728.32] in the world
[3728.32 → 3729.16] in every time
[3729.16 → 3729.70] and place.
[3730.44 → 3731.86] Because as Christians,
[3731.98 → 3732.88] as we follow Jesus
[3732.88 → 3733.46] in the world,
[3733.78 → 3734.62] there will be
[3734.62 → 3735.48] some things
[3735.48 → 3737.52] that we believe
[3737.52 → 3738.44] and hold to
[3738.44 → 3739.80] that we believe
[3739.80 → 3740.36] that God
[3740.36 → 3742.18] wants us to
[3742.18 → 3742.74] practice
[3742.74 → 3743.22] and follow
[3743.22 → 3743.76] and believe
[3743.76 → 3744.74] that will come
[3744.74 → 3745.64] up against
[3745.64 → 3746.40] the prevailing
[3746.40 → 3747.62] norms of
[3747.62 → 3748.40] the culture
[3748.40 → 3749.08] in which we live.
[3749.94 → 3750.68] And that will be
[3750.68 → 3751.78] considered very odd
[3751.78 → 3752.94] and out of place.
[3754.04 → 3754.56] And yet,
[3754.64 → 3755.04] what you see
[3755.04 → 3755.58] in these verses
[3755.58 → 3756.96] is that at the same
[3756.96 → 3758.26] time as Christians
[3758.26 → 3758.94] are called foreigners
[3758.94 → 3759.68] and exiles,
[3760.00 → 3761.78] they're not called
[3761.78 → 3762.60] to leave,
[3763.12 → 3763.86] but they are called
[3763.86 → 3765.20] to work for the good
[3765.20 → 3766.04] of the place
[3766.04 → 3766.88] in which they live.
[3767.42 → 3768.32] And so the concept
[3768.32 → 3770.24] of being a foreigner
[3770.24 → 3771.12] and an alien,
[3771.74 → 3773.16] the way to understand it
[3773.16 → 3774.34] is that we are
[3774.34 → 3775.34] resident aliens.
[3776.32 → 3777.02] In other words,
[3777.16 → 3778.30] we are not visitors
[3778.30 → 3779.32] or tourists
[3779.32 → 3780.34] who do not belong
[3780.34 → 3781.06] to that place,
[3781.06 → 3782.34] but we are residents
[3782.34 → 3783.20] of a place
[3783.20 → 3784.16] even though we don't
[3784.16 → 3784.84] belong there.
[3785.90 → 3786.56] Because that's why
[3786.56 → 3787.70] we read in verse 12,
[3789.58 → 3790.28] Peter says,
[3790.80 → 3792.30] live such good lives
[3792.30 → 3793.36] among the pagans
[3793.36 → 3793.94] that though they
[3793.94 → 3795.34] accuse you of doing wrong,
[3795.92 → 3797.28] yet they may see
[3797.28 → 3798.02] your good deeds
[3798.02 → 3799.36] and glorify God
[3799.36 → 3799.74] on the day
[3799.74 → 3800.54] he visits us.
[3801.20 → 3801.86] Peter says,
[3802.06 → 3804.60] live such good lives.
[3805.38 → 3806.28] Live lives
[3806.28 → 3807.24] of generosity.
[3808.26 → 3808.76] Live lives
[3808.76 → 3809.86] of hospitality.
[3810.44 → 3811.00] Live lives
[3811.00 → 3812.30] of service.
[3813.40 → 3814.02] And do it
[3814.02 → 3814.90] in the midst
[3814.90 → 3816.08] of the people
[3816.08 → 3817.56] for the good
[3817.56 → 3818.54] of the people
[3818.54 → 3819.34] around you,
[3819.40 → 3819.98] not just for the good
[3819.98 → 3820.36] of Christians,
[3820.46 → 3821.26] for the good of all,
[3821.64 → 3822.42] in such a way
[3822.42 → 3823.88] that people will notice
[3823.88 → 3825.78] and that they will be seen.
[3827.86 → 3828.80] And we see here
[3828.80 → 3829.48] a couple of things.
[3829.60 → 3830.04] First,
[3830.06 → 3830.88] it says that they may
[3830.88 → 3832.76] accuse you of doing wrong.
[3833.24 → 3834.14] That means that
[3834.14 → 3835.72] you might be vilified,
[3836.08 → 3837.18] you might be misunderstood.
[3838.14 → 3839.36] In our day,
[3840.58 → 3841.96] Christians are vilified
[3841.96 → 3843.94] for our sexual ethics
[3843.94 → 3845.28] because it is
[3845.28 → 3846.40] out of step
[3846.40 → 3847.80] with our culture.
[3848.26 → 3848.98] And that exerts
[3848.98 → 3850.46] tremendous pressure
[3850.46 → 3851.32] on Christians
[3851.32 → 3852.22] and on churches
[3852.22 → 3853.42] to conform,
[3853.58 → 3854.36] to assimilate
[3854.36 → 3855.40] because we don't like
[3855.40 → 3855.94] to be accused
[3855.94 → 3856.68] of doing wrong.
[3856.94 → 3857.34] We don't like
[3857.34 → 3857.74] to be seen
[3857.74 → 3858.80] as evildoers.
[3859.04 → 3859.60] We don't want
[3859.60 → 3860.50] to be misunderstood.
[3862.14 → 3863.82] But that is part
[3863.82 → 3864.94] of what it means
[3864.94 → 3865.94] to be a foreigner
[3865.94 → 3866.66] and an alien.
[3867.38 → 3868.30] But we also see
[3868.30 → 3868.88] that as Christians
[3868.88 → 3869.78] live together
[3869.78 → 3870.70] as the community
[3870.70 → 3871.40] of the church,
[3871.40 → 3873.64] in whatever place
[3873.64 → 3874.14] and time
[3874.14 → 3875.40] God pulls us together,
[3875.68 → 3877.28] we are salt and light.
[3877.66 → 3878.40] We are witnesses
[3878.40 → 3879.22] to God
[3879.22 → 3880.54] through our care
[3880.54 → 3881.48] and love for one another,
[3882.00 → 3882.72] through being
[3882.72 → 3883.64] a diverse
[3883.64 → 3885.34] multicultural community
[3885.34 → 3886.04] of people
[3886.04 → 3888.04] from different
[3888.04 → 3889.76] classes,
[3890.10 → 3891.18] different economic
[3891.18 → 3892.10] statuses,
[3892.22 → 3893.80] different occupations,
[3893.98 → 3895.28] from different places
[3895.28 → 3896.58] speaking in different languages,
[3897.32 → 3898.28] inviting in those
[3898.28 → 3899.08] with disabilities
[3899.08 → 3899.98] of different kinds,
[3900.34 → 3901.10] inviting in those
[3901.10 → 3901.82] who are marginalized.
[3902.36 → 3903.26] And these deeds
[3903.26 → 3903.92] in this community
[3903.92 → 3904.70] is so beautiful
[3904.70 → 3906.00] that it will be
[3906.00 → 3907.46] recognized as good
[3907.46 → 3909.02] and God
[3909.02 → 3910.12] will receive the glory.
[3911.86 → 3913.20] So Peter's calling
[3913.20 → 3914.34] here is remarkable.
[3915.08 → 3915.50] He says,
[3915.60 → 3916.10] on the one hand,
[3916.20 → 3917.02] don't assimilate,
[3917.14 → 3918.00] don't simply adopt
[3918.00 → 3918.58] the values
[3918.58 → 3919.22] of the culture
[3919.22 → 3919.96] you're in.
[3921.12 → 3922.86] You are resident aliens.
[3923.66 → 3924.52] So instead,
[3924.68 → 3926.24] maintain your own values
[3926.24 → 3927.62] as a community
[3927.62 → 3929.42] built on Christ
[3929.42 → 3930.60] whom you serve.
[3931.10 → 3932.32] But on the other hand,
[3932.36 → 3933.56] you live for the good
[3933.56 → 3934.10] of the people
[3934.10 → 3934.78] and for the city
[3934.78 → 3935.54] around you
[3935.54 → 3937.18] so that your good deeds
[3937.18 → 3937.90] are acknowledged
[3937.90 → 3938.94] as a benefit
[3938.94 → 3940.28] to all.
[3942.32 → 3943.14] That's what it means
[3943.14 → 3943.94] to be a pilgrim.
[3944.60 → 3945.50] So we are priests
[3945.50 → 3946.36] and we are pilgrims.
[3947.84 → 3949.02] How do we do that?
[3949.68 → 3950.28] And that leads us
[3950.28 → 3951.28] to the last thing today,
[3951.36 → 3952.04] the foundation
[3952.04 → 3952.82] of it all.
[3953.42 → 3954.58] The last thing we see
[3954.58 → 3956.06] in these verses
[3956.06 → 3957.18] is the foundational
[3957.18 → 3957.98] cornerstone
[3957.98 → 3959.12] for this kind of life
[3959.12 → 3959.86] that God has called us
[3959.86 → 3960.26] to live.
[3960.58 → 3961.24] This identity
[3961.24 → 3961.72] and life
[3961.72 → 3962.70] is built on
[3962.70 → 3963.80] a cornerstone.
[3964.76 → 3965.98] So verse 7 says,
[3966.34 → 3967.26] the stone the builders
[3967.26 → 3967.74] rejected
[3967.74 → 3968.42] has become
[3968.42 → 3969.14] the cornerstone.
[3969.88 → 3970.90] So what is a cornerstone?
[3971.00 → 3971.58] The cornerstone
[3971.58 → 3972.18] is typically
[3972.18 → 3972.82] the stone
[3972.82 → 3973.78] on which
[3973.78 → 3974.68] the entire structure
[3974.68 → 3975.26] is built.
[3976.26 → 3976.80] And make sure
[3976.80 → 3978.06] all the walls
[3978.06 → 3979.04] are straight
[3979.04 → 3980.20] and aligned
[3980.20 → 3981.16] so that the entire
[3981.16 → 3982.36] building can be built up
[3982.36 → 3983.66] and stand firm
[3983.66 → 3984.60] in one place.
[3985.76 → 3985.96] Right?
[3986.02 → 3987.36] It's that first stone
[3987.36 → 3988.14] that orients
[3988.14 → 3989.86] all the other stones.
[3990.94 → 3991.82] And so what that means
[3991.82 → 3992.44] is,
[3992.90 → 3993.10] right,
[3993.14 → 3994.00] this is an analogy,
[3994.60 → 3995.14] what it means
[3995.14 → 3996.22] is that we are all
[3996.22 → 3998.66] building our lives
[3998.66 → 3999.80] on some kind
[3999.80 → 4000.34] of foundation.
[4000.96 → 4001.90] All of us do.
[4002.54 → 4003.22] We're all building
[4003.22 → 4003.74] our lives
[4003.74 → 4004.54] on some kind
[4004.54 → 4005.16] of cornerstone.
[4005.96 → 4007.08] We all have something
[4007.08 → 4008.44] that grounds our lives
[4008.44 → 4010.02] and that we are building
[4010.02 → 4011.34] our lives upon.
[4012.46 → 4014.02] So whether it is
[4014.02 → 4015.52] power or approval,
[4016.10 → 4017.58] whether it is money
[4017.58 → 4018.46] or possessions
[4018.46 → 4020.68] that is our foundation,
[4021.10 → 4022.08] whether it is
[4022.08 → 4022.98] our citizenship
[4022.98 → 4024.16] or our ethnicity,
[4024.50 → 4025.24] our gender
[4025.24 → 4026.40] or our sexuality,
[4026.66 → 4027.84] we're all building
[4027.84 → 4028.86] our identity
[4028.86 → 4030.44] on a sense of self
[4030.44 → 4032.20] as some kind
[4032.20 → 4032.98] of foundation
[4032.98 → 4034.96] that orients us
[4034.96 → 4035.66] into the world
[4035.66 → 4036.72] and who we are.
[4037.40 → 4038.72] But Peter is telling us
[4038.72 → 4039.48] that there is ultimately
[4039.48 → 4040.88] only one cornerstone
[4040.88 → 4042.08] that we should build
[4042.08 → 4042.86] our lives on
[4042.86 → 4043.66] and that gives us
[4043.66 → 4044.26] an identity
[4044.26 → 4045.30] and orients us
[4045.30 → 4045.82] in the world.
[4046.50 → 4047.32] In verse 6,
[4047.42 → 4048.08] he says,
[4048.80 → 4049.04] see,
[4049.20 → 4050.40] I lay a stone
[4050.40 → 4051.08] in Zion,
[4051.74 → 4052.48] a chosen
[4052.48 → 4053.20] and precious
[4053.20 → 4053.96] cornerstone,
[4054.44 → 4055.78] the one who trusts
[4055.78 → 4056.48] in him,
[4056.66 → 4057.72] the one who builds
[4057.72 → 4058.62] his or her life
[4058.62 → 4059.84] on this cornerstone
[4059.84 → 4060.96] will never be put
[4060.96 → 4061.32] to shame.
[4062.48 → 4063.32] What does it mean
[4063.32 → 4064.14] to be put to shame?
[4065.42 → 4066.38] What it means
[4066.38 → 4067.28] is to build your life
[4067.28 → 4067.74] on something
[4067.74 → 4068.74] and to trust in something
[4068.74 → 4070.08] as a foundational
[4070.08 → 4071.24] piece of your life
[4071.24 → 4073.02] to have it then
[4073.02 → 4074.18] crumble under you
[4074.18 → 4076.26] so that you discover,
[4076.64 → 4077.48] even maybe after
[4077.48 → 4078.90] obtaining it,
[4078.98 → 4080.58] that it actually disappoints,
[4080.70 → 4082.10] that it fails to give you
[4082.10 → 4082.72] what it hoped
[4082.72 → 4083.48] it would give you.
[4083.82 → 4085.40] It doesn't actually
[4085.40 → 4086.18] make you happy
[4086.18 → 4087.04] once you have it.
[4087.56 → 4088.68] You are left empty.
[4089.52 → 4090.90] It doesn't give you
[4090.90 → 4092.08] the purpose of life
[4092.08 → 4092.96] that you are seeking.
[4093.52 → 4094.46] It doesn't tell you
[4094.46 → 4095.56] who you truly are
[4095.56 → 4096.36] and the true purpose
[4096.36 → 4096.96] of your life.
[4097.90 → 4098.82] And when we build
[4098.82 → 4099.68] our lives on anything
[4099.68 → 4100.44] but God
[4100.44 → 4101.42] as that foundation,
[4101.60 → 4102.34] we will be put
[4102.34 → 4103.30] to shame.
[4104.02 → 4105.60] But there is a cornerstone
[4105.60 → 4106.60] that is precious.
[4107.44 → 4108.40] And by definition,
[4108.60 → 4109.36] a building can only
[4109.36 → 4110.72] have one cornerstone.
[4110.80 → 4111.86] There's only one stone
[4111.86 → 4113.74] that will orient
[4113.74 → 4114.96] all the walls
[4114.96 → 4115.74] and keep everything
[4115.74 → 4116.58] else lined up.
[4117.46 → 4118.08] And to have
[4118.08 → 4119.34] a precious cornerstone
[4119.34 → 4120.02] means that there is
[4120.02 → 4121.66] one particular stone
[4121.66 → 4123.38] that can do that.
[4123.38 → 4125.48] That can provide
[4125.48 → 4126.28] that stability
[4126.28 → 4127.72] and that puts everything
[4127.72 → 4129.18] else in the proper order.
[4130.04 → 4131.18] And Peter is telling us
[4131.18 → 4132.70] that that cornerstone
[4132.70 → 4134.18] is Jesus Christ.
[4135.66 → 4136.90] And think about Jesus.
[4137.24 → 4139.88] Jesus was a foreigner
[4139.88 → 4141.20] and an alien,
[4141.30 → 4141.70] wasn't he?
[4142.48 → 4144.44] He left his home
[4144.44 → 4144.92] in heaven,
[4145.72 → 4146.92] his native land.
[4147.00 → 4147.62] He came into
[4147.62 → 4148.46] a far country.
[4149.22 → 4150.10] He came and dwelt
[4150.10 → 4151.08] among us,
[4151.62 → 4152.62] took on flesh,
[4152.62 → 4155.08] spoke in a particular way,
[4155.14 → 4156.38] in a particular culture,
[4156.92 → 4158.50] wore the cultural clothing,
[4158.68 → 4159.76] spoke the language,
[4160.46 → 4161.76] used the idioms.
[4162.62 → 4164.26] But he lived
[4164.26 → 4165.72] as a resident alien.
[4165.88 → 4166.68] He lived according
[4166.68 → 4167.94] to his father's will.
[4168.54 → 4169.50] He lived in a way
[4169.50 → 4170.12] that was often
[4170.12 → 4171.00] not in step
[4171.00 → 4171.62] with the culture.
[4172.26 → 4173.54] Jesus didn't assimilate,
[4173.68 → 4174.22] but he lived
[4174.22 → 4176.00] such a good life
[4176.00 → 4176.72] among us
[4176.72 → 4177.40] that everyone
[4177.40 → 4178.52] witnessed it,
[4178.88 → 4179.58] everyone who did
[4179.58 → 4180.12] witness it,
[4180.64 → 4181.64] they praised God.
[4182.62 → 4183.46] They might not
[4183.46 → 4184.56] have always understood him,
[4184.64 → 4185.30] but it led them
[4185.30 → 4186.00] to praise God.
[4186.80 → 4187.62] No one understood
[4187.62 → 4188.70] more than Jesus
[4188.70 → 4189.38] what it means
[4189.38 → 4190.20] to do good,
[4190.32 → 4191.46] but to be misunderstood,
[4191.76 → 4192.68] to be vilified
[4192.68 → 4193.48] for what he did.
[4194.16 → 4196.04] He was the ultimate priest
[4196.04 → 4197.84] who call us all
[4197.84 → 4198.86] to God.
[4199.94 → 4200.56] He is also
[4200.56 → 4201.84] the ultimate pilgrim,
[4202.24 → 4203.40] rejected by his family,
[4203.76 → 4204.88] rejected by his friends,
[4205.06 → 4206.38] ultimately on the cross,
[4206.92 → 4207.82] receiving the wrath
[4207.82 → 4208.50] and rejection
[4208.50 → 4209.14] of God
[4209.14 → 4209.94] on our behalf.
[4209.94 → 4211.68] But though he was
[4211.68 → 4212.92] rejected and discarded,
[4213.12 → 4213.96] he didn't assimilate.
[4214.50 → 4215.36] He didn't also,
[4215.48 → 4215.62] though,
[4215.74 → 4216.22] withdraw.
[4216.96 → 4217.92] He didn't turn
[4217.92 → 4220.00] in hostility toward us.
[4220.06 → 4220.38] Instead,
[4220.78 → 4222.62] he moved toward us
[4222.62 → 4223.56] in love,
[4223.66 → 4224.76] in redeeming love,
[4225.12 → 4226.30] by giving his life
[4226.30 → 4226.84] for us
[4226.84 → 4229.08] so that we could be,
[4229.82 → 4230.60] so that he could be
[4230.60 → 4232.40] our precious cornerstone,
[4232.52 → 4233.60] so that we could build
[4233.60 → 4234.84] our lives on him
[4234.84 → 4236.44] and not be put to shame.
[4236.44 → 4238.86] To be a Christian
[4238.86 → 4240.66] means that your life
[4240.66 → 4241.40] is built
[4241.40 → 4243.16] on Jesus Christ,
[4243.24 → 4243.98] the cornerstone,
[4244.36 → 4246.12] and what he did for you.
[4247.02 → 4247.92] In Jesus,
[4248.08 → 4249.04] we have a pilgrim
[4249.04 → 4249.40] saviour.
[4251.36 → 4252.86] And in Christ,
[4253.86 → 4255.34] we hear this call
[4255.34 → 4256.60] to live differently,
[4257.34 → 4258.90] to live according
[4258.90 → 4260.82] to a different reality.
[4261.58 → 4262.06] Yes,
[4262.08 → 4262.76] we're called to live
[4262.76 → 4263.52] in this world,
[4264.18 → 4264.98] but we're called
[4264.98 → 4266.30] to be resident aliens,
[4266.30 → 4266.88] that belong
[4266.88 → 4268.02] to another country,
[4268.02 → 4269.42] and we work
[4269.42 → 4270.40] for different goals
[4270.40 → 4271.46] and for a different kingdom.
[4272.46 → 4274.82] And as the holy priesthood
[4274.82 → 4275.44] of God,
[4276.06 → 4278.02] indwelt by the Spirit,
[4278.68 → 4279.48] as we're reminded
[4279.48 → 4280.56] on this Pentecost Sunday,
[4281.22 → 4283.88] we also welcome
[4283.88 → 4286.32] others to find
[4286.32 → 4287.90] their ultimate home
[4287.90 → 4288.72] in Christ,
[4289.12 → 4291.24] to find a cornerstone
[4291.24 → 4292.26] on Christ,
[4292.36 → 4293.44] and to find their home
[4293.44 → 4294.32] in a new creation.
[4294.32 → 4296.46] You are a priest,
[4296.58 → 4297.38] you are a pilgrim.
[4298.08 → 4298.62] Let's pray.
[4301.76 → 4302.20] Father,
[4302.28 → 4302.98] we thank you for
[4302.98 → 4304.12] these words of encouragement
[4304.12 → 4305.18] from Peter.
[4305.94 → 4306.32] And Lord,
[4306.36 → 4307.18] we also lived
[4307.18 → 4308.44] in troubled times
[4308.44 → 4310.64] and a troubled place
[4310.64 → 4312.84] because we also
[4312.84 → 4314.04] are seen
[4314.04 → 4315.56] as very strange.
[4315.56 → 4317.64] Lord,
[4317.70 → 4319.18] help us to stand
[4319.18 → 4319.74] firm
[4319.74 → 4320.94] on Christ,
[4321.72 → 4322.50] but also
[4322.50 → 4323.78] to move
[4323.78 → 4325.22] with love
[4325.22 → 4326.54] toward our culture
[4326.54 → 4327.38] for their good
[4327.38 → 4329.62] so that you may be glorified
[4329.62 → 4330.78] and more people
[4330.78 → 4331.74] brought into the church.
[4332.34 → 4332.58] Lord,
[4332.66 → 4333.68] help us by your Spirit
[4333.68 → 4334.20] always.
[4334.66 → 4335.76] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4336.00 → 4336.22] Amen.
[4336.22 → 4336.32] Amen.
[4336.32 → 4337.06] Amen.
[4338.06 → 4338.18] Amen.
[4339.08 → 4339.58] Amen.
[4339.58 → 4341.88] Amen.
[4343.96 → 4344.20] Amen.
[4344.20 → 4344.28] Amen.
[4344.28 → 4345.28] Amen.
[4374.28 → 4375.28] Amen.
[4404.28 → 4405.28] Amen.
[4434.28 → 4436.28] Amen.
[4464.28 → 4465.28] Amen.
[4494.28 → 4495.28] Amen.
[4524.28 → 4525.28] Amen.
[4554.28 → 4555.28] Amen.
[4555.28 → 4556.28] Amen.
[4556.28 → 4557.28] Amen.
[4557.28 → 4558.28] Amen.
[4558.28 → 4561.86] So please join me in a community prayer.
[4561.86 → 4571.52] One thing we will pray for is just the sad news that Annie Crohn went to be with the Lord
[4571.52 → 4577.62] Friday evening or in the night at some point with her family there with her.
[4577.62 → 4582.20] And so let's pray for the family and for God's comfort upon them.
[4582.20 → 4585.74] Let's pray together.
[4585.74 → 4592.78] Our Heavenly Father, it is your kindness that leads us to repentance.
[4592.78 → 4600.42] And it is your grace that breaks down the barriers of sin and shame that would separate us from
[4600.42 → 4603.64] you and from one another.
[4603.64 → 4609.14] And though we may be great sinners, you are even a greater Saviour.
[4609.14 → 4612.10] And so, Lord, we bring our burdens to you.
[4612.10 → 4615.18] The things that would break our hearts.
[4615.18 → 4622.48] And we enter into your throne room with confidence because of the grace in which we stand.
[4622.48 → 4626.98] So Lord, we mourn with many around this country and around the world.
[4626.98 → 4636.66] We mourn for all those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, all those who struggle with sickness.
[4637.36 → 4644.66] We mourn with the elderly who have lived still in isolation and loneliness.
[4644.66 → 4655.04] Lord, though we thank you for the vaccines that have been rolling out, and that things are opening up and families are being able to see and be with one another.
[4655.04 → 4656.54] Lord, we thank you for that.
[4656.54 → 4663.54] Lord, we pray that you would also break our hearts with the things that break yours.
[4665.54 → 4671.34] And Lord, we pray that you'd be with our dear brother, Jake Iron, as he mourns the loss of his mom, Annie.
[4671.34 → 4674.16] Come for him and all the family.
[4675.70 → 4681.36] Lord, be present with them and speak tenderly to them with all of your words of grace.
[4681.36 → 4690.88] And Lord, would you break our hearts in the same way that your heart is broken because of your love for this world.
[4693.36 → 4696.84] By grace, we have been created in your image.
[4697.92 → 4705.06] And so we mourn all of those struggles, those things that, Lord, would harm us, your people.
[4705.06 → 4713.08] Lord, help your church to proclaim the gospel of a gracious God who loves us.
[4714.30 → 4719.32] And Lord Jesus, there is much sorrow in this world, but do not let it overwhelm us.
[4719.64 → 4720.58] Do not let it take us.
[4720.70 → 4727.98] We also, though, do not want to minimize or ignore it because you have told us that in this world we will have trouble.
[4728.92 → 4733.32] You also told us to take heart, for you have overcome this world.
[4733.32 → 4741.52] So, Lord, we pray that we, your church, would be conduits of your mercy and your justice and your hope in this world.
[4741.64 → 4744.94] That we would be your priests in your temple.
[4746.04 → 4751.18] That we would live in this world for your glory and the good of those around us.
[4751.72 → 4760.88] Equip this congregation not to be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds and by the filling of your Holy Spirit.
[4760.88 → 4767.24] Lord, we pray in the name of Jesus, our Lord, our gracious and kind Saviour.
[4768.06 → 4768.46] Amen.
[4770.50 → 4783.56] So, brothers and sisters, let's go forth into the world following our Lord Jesus with the presence of God, the Holy Spirit, in us and with us and with his blessing upon us.
[4783.56 → 4787.30] So, I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the benediction.
[4788.38 → 4795.96] May the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope,
[4796.62 → 4804.86] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, give you the Holy Spirit to dwell with you today and always.
[4805.58 → 4805.92] Amen.
[4805.92 → 4806.00] Amen.
[4806.30 → 4809.58] teens sung by
[4816.98 → 4820.74] to God
[4820.74 → 4824.52] To God be the glory.
[4825.38 → 4830.44] To God be the glory.
[4831.28 → 4836.62] To God be the glory.
[4837.10 → 4842.84] For the things he has done.
[4842.84 → 4849.22] With his blood he has sent me.
[4849.22 → 4855.68] With his blood he has raised me.
[4856.24 → 4861.12] To God be the glory.
[4861.90 → 4867.24] For the things he has done.
[4879.22 → 4885.68] To God be the glory.
[4885.68 → 4887.68] To God be the glory.
[4887.68 → 4889.68] To God be the glory.
[4889.68 → 4896.14] For the things he has done.
[4896.14 → 4898.14] To God be the glory.
[4898.14 → 4900.60] To God be the glory.
[4900.60 → 4930.58] Thank you.
