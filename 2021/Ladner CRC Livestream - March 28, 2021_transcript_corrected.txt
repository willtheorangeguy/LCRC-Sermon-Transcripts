[280.00 → 289.00] Good morning and welcome to our service this morning on this Palm Sunday.
[289.00 → 296.00] A little blustery, I think the meteorologists did not realize it was Palm Sunday, or they might have given us a little bit nicer weather.
[296.00 → 313.00] However, Palm Sunday is the day that brings us or leads us into Holy Week, the historical events in which God turned the world upside down, or perhaps I should say right side up again.
[313.00 → 324.00] And so this is the week when we can reflect on those events in history and what they mean to us and for our faith.
[324.00 → 331.00] I encourage you today to call someone after the service since we can't greet one another.
[331.00 → 341.00] Call someone, maybe that you haven't spoken to for a long time and just see how they're doing and have a little bit of fellowship together on the phone and maybe with a cup of coffee in your hand.
[341.00 → 359.00] Our offering today is for UBC Okanagan University and Chaplain Todd Stat ham has sent us a video that he would like to catch us up on his work, and thank us for our support.
[359.00 → 372.00] Hey folks, always glad for an opportunity to drop in, say thank you for your support for the campus ministry and to share a little bit about what I've been up to of late.
[372.00 → 385.00] I've got a question for you though. Bill C-7. Have you heard of it? Yes? No? Maybe? Bill C-7. It's before Parliament right now.
[385.00 → 401.00] It's a bill that aims to enlarge Canadians' access to medical assistance in dying, largely by removing restrictions like a foreseeable death or insufferable pain.
[401.00 → 416.00] The idea being its our life, we can do with it as we want. Bill C-7 raises all sorts of questions for Christians who believe life as a gift from God and is ultimately accountable to him.
[416.00 → 423.00] It also raises some concerns for Christians about the most vulnerable persons in our society.
[423.00 → 436.00] It's a heavy topic. Why am I talking about it this morning with you? Well, usually I share a little bit about what I'm doing with students. Today I want to just take a second and share a little bit about what I do with faculty.
[436.00 → 444.00] The campus ministry facilitates a research cluster of Christian professors from different disciplines in the university.
[444.00 → 455.00] And we're working on a project together on death, suffering, and palliative care with an eye on some of the policy decisions that are being made in Canada.
[455.00 → 460.00] Because we believe as Christians and as academics, we need to have a voice debate in this discussion.
[460.00 → 477.00] That's what's exciting about campus ministry. That's what's exciting about campus ministry. Something I really thank God for is this opportunity to be part of a conversation that's shaping policy and to take part in some of the big ideas that are cooked up on campus and have an impact on all of our lives.
[477.00 → 482.00] So thank you for being part of this too through your support of your campus ministry.
[482.00 → 497.00] If you ever want to hear more about what I'm doing, just talk to me. I'm having to send you a newsletter, update, or even better, have a chat in person or on Zoom. God bless. God bless. Thank you.
[497.00 → 503.00] Please join me for our invitation to worship, which is a responsive reading.
[503.00 → 504.00] Thank you.
[504.00 → 505.00] Let's read.
[505.00 → 524.00] Come, worship the king who approached his people not on a war horse, but on a donkey, who did not raise a sword to the Romans, but silently submitted to their torture, whose kingdom is not of this world, yet is being built among the broken and wounded.
[524.00 → 527.66] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[528.68 → 534.46] People of God, if we don't praise our King, even the stones will cry out.
[535.40 → 538.96] Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.
[539.72 → 540.86] Would you pray with me?
[542.80 → 549.22] God of all time, as we prepare to worship you today and in this upcoming Holy Week,
[549.22 → 556.38] may we bring to mind these past events in Jesus' life and reflect on their significance for our lives today
[556.38 → 559.96] and for the future you are preparing for all creation.
[560.56 → 562.58] In Jesus' name, amen.
[563.76 → 568.76] God greets us with his grace, mercy, and peace this morning.
[570.42 → 573.12] Let's respond with praise and worship.
[579.22 → 592.18] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our King.
[592.18 → 600.84] Make known the power of his grace, the beauty of his grace.
[600.84 → 609.18] Remember how his mercy reached, and we cried out to him.
[609.88 → 618.04] He lifted us too solemn to freedom from our sin.
[618.04 → 626.74] Oh, save my soul, and tell all he's done,
[627.08 → 632.50] Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory.
[635.24 → 644.04] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord.
[644.04 → 652.70] His power in us is greater than, is greater than this world.
[652.70 → 661.64] To share the reason for our hope, to serve with love and grace.
[661.64 → 670.40] That all who see him shine through us, might bring the Father praise.
[670.40 → 679.06] Oh, save my soul, and tell all he's done,
[679.06 → 684.92] Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory.
[687.60 → 696.66] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our light.
[696.66 → 705.40] No other name on earth can save, can raise a soul to life.
[705.40 → 714.00] He opens up our eyes to see the harvest he has grown.
[714.66 → 722.86] We labour in his fields of grace, as he leads sinners home.
[722.86 → 731.52] Oh, save my soul, and tell all he's done,
[731.52 → 737.92] Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory.
[739.60 → 747.30] Save my soul, and tell all he's done,
[747.30 → 753.54] Till the earth and heavens are filled with his glory.
[753.54 → 757.02] He is great and times to love us,
[757.06 → 762.24] Villain, all sudden competency
[762.24 → 763.42] Ho, ho, ho.
[763.42 → 764.46] Hosanna!
[765.08 → 766.66] Hallelujah!
[766.92 → 770.46] Paranoia, say great.

[837.38 → 839.38] Hosanna
[839.38 → 844.26] Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[845.60 → 853.26] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[855.44 → 863.26] Lord, we lift your name with hearts full of praise.
[864.26 → 868.68] Be exalted, O Lord my God.
[868.68 → 872.06] Hosanna in the highest.
[873.98 → 882.46] Glory, glory, glory to the King of Kings.
[883.22 → 891.70] Glory, glory, glory to the King of Kings.
[892.50 → 898.56] Lord, we lift your name with hearts full of praise.
[898.68 → 905.90] Be exalted, O Lord my God.
[905.90 → 910.90] Glory to the King of Kings.
[910.90 → 920.00] How great the chasm that lay between us.
[920.00 → 933.06] How great the chasm that lay between us.
[933.06 → 939.06] How high the mountain I could not climb.
[939.28 → 952.06] In desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[952.06 → 959.06] Lord, we lift your name with hearts full of praise.
[959.06 → 964.28] Torn through the shadows of my soul.
[964.28 → 968.06] The work is finished.
[968.28 → 971.06] The end is written.
[971.06 → 978.06] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[978.06 → 988.06] Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[988.06 → 994.28] What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[994.28 → 995.28] The God of angels.
[995.28 → 997.28] The God of angels.
[997.28 → 998.28] The God of angels.
[998.28 → 1001.28] Step down from glory.
[1001.50 → 1004.28] To bear my sin.
[1004.28 → 1007.28] And bear my shame.
[1007.28 → 1011.28] The cross has spoken.
[1011.28 → 1012.28] I am forgiven.
[1012.28 → 1013.28] I am forgiven.
[1013.28 → 1014.28] I am forgiven.
[1014.28 → 1020.28] The King of kings calls me his own.
[1020.28 → 1023.28] Beautiful Saviour.
[1023.28 → 1028.28] I'm yours forever.
[1028.28 → 1034.28] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1034.28 → 1035.28] Hallelujah.
[1035.28 → 1041.28] Praise the one who set me free.
[1041.28 → 1042.28] Hallelujah.
[1042.28 → 1047.28] Death has lost its grip on me.
[1047.28 → 1051.28] I am unbroken every chain.
[1051.28 → 1054.28] There's salvation in your name.
[1054.28 → 1060.28] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1060.28 → 1065.28] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1065.28 → 1070.28] Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[1070.28 → 1077.28] Your buried body began to breathe.
[1077.28 → 1086.28] Out of the silence the roaring lion
[1086.28 → 1091.28] The grave has no claim on me
[1091.28 → 1094.86] Then came the morning
[1094.86 → 1098.94] That sealed the promise
[1098.94 → 1102.02] Your buried body
[1102.02 → 1104.94] Began to breathe
[1104.94 → 1108.52] Out of the silence
[1108.52 → 1111.90] The roaring lion
[1111.90 → 1115.10] Declare the grave
[1115.10 → 1118.60] There's no claim on me
[1118.60 → 1124.78] Jesus, yours is the victory
[1124.78 → 1128.30] Hallelujah
[1128.30 → 1133.86] Praise the one who set me free
[1133.86 → 1135.30] Hallelujah
[1135.30 → 1140.76] Death has lost its grip on me
[1140.76 → 1144.24] You have broken every chain
[1144.24 → 1147.64] This salvation in your name
[1147.64 → 1153.74] Jesus Christ, our living heart
[1153.74 → 1156.76] Hallelujah
[1156.76 → 1161.46] Praise the one who set me free
[1161.46 → 1162.76] Hallelujah
[1162.76 → 1167.76] Death has lost its grip on me
[1167.76 → 1171.24] You have broken every chain
[1171.24 → 1173.24] You have broken every chain
[1173.24 → 1174.64] This salvation in your name
[1174.64 → 1178.64] Jesus Christ, our living heart
[1178.64 → 1180.74] Jesus Christ, our living heart
[1180.74 → 1184.74] Jesus Christ, our living heart
[1184.74 → 1188.74] God, you are my living heart
[1188.74 → 1194.22] God, you are my living heart
[1194.22 → 1213.56] Jesus, our Lord, we shout hosannas to praise you
[1213.56 → 1216.64] With eager hands we place our cloaks
[1216.64 → 1219.60] And palms on the path before you
[1219.60 → 1223.32] Yet, Lord, we confess that from our mouths
[1223.32 → 1224.92] Come words that praise you
[1224.92 → 1228.52] Then often deny or defy you
[1228.52 → 1233.62] And we confess that the hands that seek to serve you
[1233.62 → 1236.14] Often become fists
[1236.14 → 1239.56] Lord, hear us as we silently confess
[1239.56 → 1258.18] Hosanna to the Son of David
[1258.18 → 1262.34] Please read our assurance with me
[1262.34 → 1265.20] Hosanna to the Son of David
[1265.20 → 1268.04] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[1268.04 → 1271.02] For Christ came into the world
[1271.02 → 1272.56] Not to condemn the world
[1272.56 → 1275.76] But that the world through him should be saved
[1275.76 → 1279.58] Therefore, be imitators of God
[1279.58 → 1283.78] As beloved children, and walk in love
[1283.78 → 1285.66] As Christ loved us
[1285.66 → 1288.78] And gave himself up for us
[1288.78 → 1292.56] A fragrant offering and a sacrifice to God
[1292.56 → 1295.44] Hosanna, amen
[1295.44 → 1309.38] Jesus Christ
[1309.38 → 1327.50] I think upon your sacrifice
[1327.50 → 1330.82] You became nothing
[1330.82 → 1334.44] Poured out to death
[1334.44 → 1336.44] Many times
[1336.44 → 1337.70] Many times
[1337.70 → 1341.68] I've wondered at your gift of life
[1341.68 → 1346.56] And I'm in that place once again
[1346.56 → 1353.44] I'm in that place once again
[1353.44 → 1362.44] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1362.44 → 1366.42] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1366.42 → 1369.44] And I'm broken inside
[1369.44 → 1373.66] Once again I thank you
[1373.66 → 1379.30] Once again I pour out my life
[1379.30 → 1387.68] Now you are
[1387.68 → 1392.20] Exalted to the highest place
[1392.20 → 1395.24] King of the heavens
[1395.24 → 1398.80] Where one day I'll bow
[1398.80 → 1401.90] But for now
[1401.90 → 1406.30] I marvel at this saving grace
[1406.30 → 1408.30] I'm full of grace
[1408.30 → 1408.74] And I'm full of grace
[1408.74 → 1413.30] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1413.30 → 1416.30] I'm humbled by your mercy
[1416.30 → 1421.30] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1421.30 → 1427.30] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1427.30 → 1433.30] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside
[1433.30 → 1435.30] Once again I thank you
[1435.30 → 1440.30] Once again I pour out my life
[1440.30 → 1444.30] Once again I pour out my life
[1444.30 → 1451.30] Thank you for the cross
[1451.30 → 1453.30] Thank you for the cross
[1453.30 → 1456.30] Thank you for the cross
[1456.30 → 1459.30] Thank you for the cross
[1459.30 → 1461.30] My friend
[1461.30 → 1468.30] Thank you for the cross
[1468.30 → 1472.30] Thank you for the cross
[1472.30 → 1474.30] Thank you for the cross
[1474.30 → 1475.30] Thank you for the cross
[1475.30 → 1479.30] My friend
[1479.30 → 1484.30] Once again I look upon the cross where you died
[1484.30 → 1491.30] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside
[1491.30 → 1494.30] Once again I thank you
[1494.30 → 1499.30] Once again I pour out my life
[1499.30 → 1502.30] Once again I pour out my life
[1502.30 → 1503.30] When I pour out my life
[1503.30 → 1506.30] When I pour out my life
[1506.30 → 1508.30] When I pour out my life
[1508.30 → 1512.30] When I pour out my life
[1512.30 → 1514.30] When I pour out my life
[1514.30 → 1516.30] When I pour out my life
[1516.30 → 1517.30] Good morning everyone
[1517.30 → 1521.30] It was really great to see some of the kids in that video
[1521.30 → 1525.30] And our children's director Hannah Lao put that together
[1525.30 → 1529.30] Also of course with the help of the parents who made the videos at home
[1529.30 → 1531.30] And, so thank you for everyone who was involved
[1531.30 → 1536.30] So we are in a sermon series during this season of Lent
[1536.30 → 1540.30] Considering the significance of Jesus' death on the cross
[1540.30 → 1542.30] And kind of every week just as we say
[1542.30 → 1546.30] Once again we're looking upon the cross where you died
[1546.30 → 1551.30] You know, and we said how the cross is the very logo of Christianity
[1551.30 → 1556.30] And so the question we're asking is just what does that symbol mean?
[1556.30 → 1565.30] And I want to begin by doing a review with you for a moment of the things that we have been talking about already
[1565.30 → 1570.30] You know there's a saying from early Christianity
[1570.30 → 1576.30] That the scriptures are like a river that a lamb can walk in
[1576.30 → 1580.30] And that an elephant can swim in
[1580.30 → 1584.30] Right so simple and deep both at the same time
[1584.30 → 1588.30] And likewise the message of the cross is simple
[1588.30 → 1590.30] Christ died for us
[1590.30 → 1593.30] Right while we were still sinners
[1593.30 → 1595.30] Christ died for us
[1595.30 → 1603.30] But the message is also rich and deep and has many aspects to it
[1603.30 → 1608.30] So Jesus lived trusting and obeying God
[1608.30 → 1612.30] And so Jesus knows what it's like from the inside
[1612.30 → 1616.30] What it means to be human because Jesus entered into our humanity
[1616.30 → 1619.30] But he was without sin
[1619.30 → 1623.30] And so he is completely unique in that regard
[1623.30 → 1628.30] Jesus is the only one in all of human history who was actually sinless and righteous
[1628.30 → 1632.30] And since he was without sin
[1632.30 → 1636.30] He was not under the curse
[1636.30 → 1638.30] He owed no debt to anyone
[1638.30 → 1640.30] The devil had no claim on him
[1640.30 → 1646.30] No one could take his life away from him unless he offered it freely
[1646.30 → 1650.30] So Jesus said to Pontius Pilate at his trial
[1650.30 → 1654.30] You would have no authority over me at all
[1654.30 → 1658.30] Unless it was given to you from above
[1658.30 → 1662.30] And yet Jesus offered his life freely
[1662.30 → 1666.30] And by his willingness to suffer at the hands of his enemies
[1666.30 → 1668.30] Jesus was our example
[1668.30 → 1675.30] He was a moral example for us of not reviling when we are abused
[1675.30 → 1678.30] Of not threatening when we suffer
[1678.30 → 1680.30] And Christians throughout history
[1680.30 → 1685.30] Have always looked to that example of suffering and how Jesus bore it
[1685.30 → 1692.30] But friends, Jesus was so much more than our example, wasn't he?
[1692.30 → 1694.30] He was our substitute
[1694.30 → 1696.30] Jesus died on the cross
[1696.30 → 1699.30] But he didn't die for his own sin
[1699.30 → 1701.30] He was innocent and righteous
[1701.30 → 1705.30] So rather, on the cross, Jesus died for our sin
[1705.30 → 1709.30] He bore our sins in his body on the tree
[1709.30 → 1712.30] That we might die to sin and live to righteousness
[1712.30 → 1714.30] Our sin was placed upon him
[1714.30 → 1716.30] And he took it in our place
[1716.30 → 1719.30] He was condemned
[1719.30 → 1721.30] So that we could be forgiven
[1721.30 → 1727.30] And Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice
[1727.30 → 1733.30] That all the other sacrifices throughout the Old Testament pointed to
[1733.30 → 1736.30] And his death on the cross was an atonement
[1736.30 → 1740.30] That is, it was a satisfaction of God's anger
[1740.30 → 1748.30] The Bible tells us that God is angry about sin and evil and injustice in the world
[1748.30 → 1751.30] He is always angry at evil
[1751.30 → 1753.30] And we want him to be that way
[1753.30 → 1754.30] Right?
[1754.30 → 1757.30] But our problem is that we are sinners
[1757.30 → 1760.30] The problem with the world isn't just something out there
[1760.30 → 1762.30] The problem is in here
[1762.30 → 1765.30] We have sinned and done what is evil in God's sight
[1765.30 → 1769.30] And God's judgment against sin is therefore toward us
[1769.30 → 1771.30] That's our great dilemma
[1771.30 → 1775.30] But in his love, God solved this problem
[1775.30 → 1777.30] Because he sent the Son
[1777.30 → 1778.30] And the Son freely came
[1778.30 → 1781.30] And he satisfied the justice against evil
[1781.30 → 1784.30] That we all as human beings cry out for
[1784.30 → 1789.30] And so God's anger shows us that he is good
[1789.30 → 1791.30] He is against evil
[1791.30 → 1795.30] But the atonement proves that he is also loving
[1795.30 → 1797.30] And he is merciful
[1797.30 → 1801.30] And so when we are covered by Christ and stand beneath the cross
[1801.30 → 1804.30] By faith we are safe, we are covered
[1804.30 → 1808.30] And there is therefore no more threat of punishment
[1808.30 → 1810.30] The punishment has been settled
[1810.30 → 1812.30] The debts have been paid on Jesus
[1812.30 → 1813.30] And we are free
[1813.30 → 1817.30] God is never going to look at us and demand a second payment for sin
[1817.30 → 1819.30] It's been settled
[1819.30 → 1821.30] And so when God looks at us
[1821.30 → 1823.30] He is not angry anymore
[1823.30 → 1827.30] He looks on us in love and in delight
[1827.30 → 1830.30] And we are declared righteous in God's sight
[1830.30 → 1832.30] We have been bought with a price
[1832.30 → 1834.30] So we have been redeemed
[1834.30 → 1836.30] The stain of sin has been washed away
[1836.30 → 1838.30] And we are made clean
[1838.30 → 1842.30] Jesus set us free by breaking the chains of the fear of death
[1842.30 → 1845.30] Jesus saw us while we were wandering
[1845.30 → 1847.30] And he brought us home
[1847.30 → 1851.30] That's some of the things we have looked at already
[1851.30 → 1855.30] And all of these words and images help us understand the richness
[1855.30 → 1858.30] And the depth of what the cross means
[1858.30 → 1861.30] So again, the message of the cross is simple enough
[1861.30 → 1864.30] That even a lamb can walk in it
[1864.30 → 1868.30] And yet it is also deep enough for an elephant to swim
[1868.30 → 1871.30] And I think it is wonderful that it is both
[1871.30 → 1875.30] So on the one hand, we can be like that lamb
[1875.30 → 1879.30] We can kind of walk confidently in these gentle streams
[1879.30 → 1881.30] In the simple truth of the gospel
[1881.30 → 1883.30] Jesus died for me
[1883.30 → 1885.30] And that message is powerful
[1885.30 → 1886.30] Right?
[1886.30 → 1888.30] When we proclaim that message
[1888.30 → 1890.30] Jesus died for sinners
[1890.30 → 1892.30] And someone hears that message
[1892.30 → 1894.30] And the Holy Spirit can use that
[1894.30 → 1896.30] In a person's life
[1896.30 → 1898.30] To cause them to turn to Christ in faith
[1898.30 → 1899.30] To be saved
[1901.30 → 1903.30] But then as we grow in the Christian life
[1903.30 → 1906.30] We can begin to swim out further
[1906.30 → 1909.30] And maybe into those deeper waters of the river
[1910.30 → 1912.30] Now for some of us, for good reason
[1912.30 → 1914.30] We might be a little bit leery of theology
[1914.30 → 1919.30] Maybe, you know, it seems to kind of take the simple truth of the gospel
[1919.30 → 1922.30] And needlessly complicate it
[1923.30 → 1926.30] Theology can kind of seem abstract and not very practical
[1927.30 → 1929.30] But let me say a word in defence of theology
[1931.30 → 1937.30] As we become more and more aware of the meaning of Jesus' death
[1937.30 → 1942.30] This leads us to become more and more aware of the depths of God's love for us
[1943.30 → 1945.30] And it leads us to praise and to wonder
[1946.30 → 1950.30] So, for instance, my wife, Christy, studied chemistry in university
[1951.30 → 1953.30] It's something that I do not pretend to understand
[1954.30 → 1960.30] And when she talks about chemical reactions and chemical compounds
[1960.30 → 1966.30] Sometimes I will hear her say something about how amazing God's design in creation is
[1967.30 → 1971.30] That when you can understand the intricacies and the beauty
[1972.30 → 1974.30] It leads you to praise God
[1975.30 → 1979.30] Right? I can't be astounded at God for those things
[1980.30 → 1981.30] Because I don't understand them
[1982.30 → 1986.30] But her deeper knowledge leads her to a greater awe of God
[1987.30 → 1991.30] Right? Her greater knowledge of chemistry makes her more amazed, not less
[1992.30 → 1995.30] And this is how learning a bit of theology can help us
[1996.30 → 1999.30] Not to puff us up in pride to say, look at how much I know
[2000.30 → 2007.30] But in humility to say, look at all that Jesus has done for us on the cross
[2008.30 → 2014.30] And so over these last few weeks we've talked about a few things about the meaning of the cross
[2014.30 → 2017.30] But friends, we have not even begun to exhaust it
[2018.30 → 2023.30] There is so much more that was happening on the cross for us as God's children
[2024.30 → 2026.30] And so today we're going to look at yet another angle
[2027.30 → 2029.30] So would you turn with me to Colossians chapter 1
[2030.30 → 2032.30] We're just going to look at a small passage
[2033.30 → 2035.30] Colossians 1 verses 19 to 23
[2035.30 → 2043.30] For God was pleased to have all of his fullness dwell in him, that is Jesus
[2044.30 → 2048.30] And through him to reconcile to himself all things
[2049.30 → 2052.30] Whether things on earth or things in heaven
[2053.30 → 2056.30] By making peace through his bloodshed on the cross
[2057.30 → 2062.30] Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behaviour
[2062.30 → 2071.30] But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight
[2072.30 → 2074.30] Without blemish and free from accusation
[2075.30 → 2080.30] If you continue in your faith, established and firm and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel
[2081.30 → 2086.30] This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven
[2087.30 → 2090.30] And of which I, Paul, have become a servant
[2090.30 → 2092.30] This is God's word
[2093.30 → 2094.30] So let's pray together as we
[2095.30 → 2097.30] Dive into this passage a bit
[2098.30 → 2099.30] Let's pray
[2100.30 → 2104.30] Father, again, would you help us to look upon the cross where you died
[2105.30 → 2112.30] Lord, would you help us see what it means for us as your children
[2113.30 → 2114.30] And help us, Lord, to be astounded
[2114.30 → 2118.30] Help us to see your beauty, the beauty of Christ
[2119.30 → 2120.30] And lead us into worship
[2121.30 → 2122.30] We pray for your help in Jesus' name
[2123.30 → 2124.30] Amen
[2125.30 → 2129.30] And so today we want to talk about what Jesus accomplished on the cross
[2130.30 → 2133.30] Particularly as it relates to restoring broken relationships
[2134.30 → 2136.30] This is another aspect of the cross
[2137.30 → 2139.30] Another aspect of what Jesus accomplished
[2139.30 → 2143.30] You know, when all of us have experienced the pain of broken relationships
[2144.30 → 2149.30] Right? We've experienced the pain when there is a break, a separation, a division
[2150.30 → 2151.30] In a relationship
[2152.30 → 2158.30] You know, and it can span from all the way from a simple annoyance that we all experience almost daily
[2158.30 → 2160.30] You know, like, or maybe something like this
[2161.30 → 2163.30] When you are supposed to meet someone for coffee
[2164.30 → 2167.30] And you forget, and you leave them stranded
[2168.30 → 2169.30] Hypothetically, I've never done this, I don't think
[2170.30 → 2171.30] But just as an example
[2172.30 → 2176.30] Something kind of small like that where it's annoying, but it's not that big of a deal
[2177.30 → 2182.30] But now, because of that, there's some small relational damage there that's been done
[2182.30 → 2186.30] And you need to apologize and maybe say, hey, next time I will buy lunch
[2187.30 → 2188.30] Something like that
[2189.30 → 2192.30] But of course, the pain of broken relationships can move all the way to the other side
[2193.30 → 2196.30] Where there is a painful separation between us and another person
[2197.30 → 2203.30] And we've all have our own experiences, many of them deeply painful, where the relationship has been broken
[2204.30 → 2207.30] There's been hurt, there's been harm
[2207.30 → 2213.30] Some of us have been reconciled and some of us have not
[2214.30 → 2218.30] Well, we all know that feeling of being distant from someone
[2219.30 → 2220.30] Relationally and emotionally
[2221.30 → 2222.30] And it doesn't matter your age
[2223.30 → 2224.30] You understand that feeling of shame
[2225.30 → 2227.30] So kids, you know this as well
[2228.30 → 2230.30] You know, when you disobey your parents
[2231.30 → 2232.30] It's hard to look at them, isn't it?
[2232.30 → 2236.30] It's hard to look at them in the eye
[2238.30 → 2242.30] Because you have that feeling of shame
[2243.30 → 2244.30] You have a feeling of distance
[2245.30 → 2248.30] And it feels bad because you want to feel close
[2249.30 → 2250.30] You want to feel loved and accepted
[2251.30 → 2253.30] You want to feel at right in the relationship
[2253.30 → 2260.30] And the Bible tells us that just as all of us experience broken relationships horizontally with other people
[2261.30 → 2269.30] All of us, without exception, have a broken relationship vertically between us and God
[2270.30 → 2274.30] God was distant from us because we sinned
[2274.30 → 2277.30] But in Christ, He moved toward us
[2278.30 → 2281.30] So that we don't have to have that feeling of being far away from God
[2282.30 → 2288.30] We don't have to have that feeling of division and emotional separateness from Him
[2289.30 → 2295.30] Because Jesus has made a way for our relationship with God to be healed and to be restored
[2295.30 → 2300.30] So this morning, I want to look at this brief passage
[2301.30 → 2302.30] And look at three things
[2302.30 → 2303.30] Very simply
[2304.30 → 2305.30] The need for reconciliation
[2306.30 → 2307.30] The way of reconciliation
[2307.30 → 2308.30] And then the result of reconciliation
[2309.30 → 2311.30] Okay, so the need, the way, and the result
[2312.30 → 2313.30] So let's look at these
[2313.30 → 2314.30] First, the need for reconciliation
[2315.30 → 2316.30] So when Paul's speaking about being reconciled to God
[2317.30 → 2318.30] He's saying, first
[2319.30 → 2320.30] That there's a problem in the relationship
[2321.30 → 2323.30] That's why we need to be reconciled
[2323.30 → 2326.30] Because we are estranged from God
[2327.30 → 2328.30] So think back with me
[2329.30 → 2330.30] All the way back to Genesis
[2331.30 → 2332.30] To the story of the original creation
[2333.30 → 2337.30] And in particular, to the brokenness that then entered into our lives
[2338.30 → 2340.30] Right, so in the beginning, Adam and Eve
[2341.30 → 2342.30] Had a perfect relationship with God
[2343.30 → 2345.30] I mean, we can't even imagine what that was like
[2346.30 → 2348.30] But the Bible tells us as human beings
[2348.30 → 2350.30] That we were created to enjoy
[2351.30 → 2353.30] A intimacy
[2354.30 → 2356.30] And a delight and a joy
[2357.30 → 2358.30] In our relationship with God
[2359.30 → 2361.30] Where we lived in his presence
[2362.30 → 2363.30] With his blessing upon us
[2364.30 → 2366.30] In this relational closeness with God
[2367.30 → 2368.30] We enjoyed the delight of our Heavenly Father
[2369.30 → 2372.30] But then this perfect relationship was shattered
[2372.30 → 2373.30] Because Adam and Eve
[2373.30 → 2374.30] Because Adam and Eve
[2375.30 → 2376.30] Began to pull away
[2377.30 → 2379.30] And they began to question and doubt God's goodness
[2380.30 → 2383.30] And as soon as they turned their backs on God
[2384.30 → 2387.30] And ignored his word to them
[2388.30 → 2389.30] What happened?
[2390.30 → 2393.30] Well, what happened is that creation began to unravel
[2394.30 → 2395.30] Brokenness entered the world
[2395.30 → 2396.30] We were sent out of the garden
[2396.30 → 2398.30] Away from God's presence
[2399.30 → 2400.30] We were exiled from him
[2401.30 → 2404.30] So if you look at verse 21 in our passage
[2405.30 → 2406.30] It says
[2407.30 → 2408.30] Once you were alienated from God
[2409.30 → 2411.30] And were enemies in your minds
[2412.30 → 2415.30] Right, that's been our spiritual condition ever since
[2416.30 → 2418.30] This lifelong alienation and estrangement from God
[2419.30 → 2421.30] So what I want us to see this morning
[2421.30 → 2423.30] Is that our relationship with God has been broken
[2424.30 → 2426.30] And that there is a need for reconciliation
[2427.30 → 2429.30] So I heard this illustration
[2430.30 → 2435.30] It's from, originally it's from, Pastor Andy Stanley
[2436.30 → 2437.30] So he said this
[2438.30 → 2439.30] He said, I used to do a lot of marriage counselling
[2440.30 → 2442.30] And often one spouse would come into the office
[2443.30 → 2444.30] And they would just start ranting and raving
[2445.30 → 2446.30] My husband does this
[2446.30 → 2448.30] Or my wife, you know, she never does that
[2448.30 → 2451.30] And it would go on and on
[2452.30 → 2453.30] And Pastor Stanley says
[2454.30 → 2455.30] He would sit there and think
[2455.30 → 2457.30] Like this counselling isn't going to be very effective
[2458.30 → 2460.30] Because the person who apparently needs to change
[2461.30 → 2462.30] Isn't in the room
[2463.30 → 2464.30] And so he says
[2465.30 → 2466.30] I would get a pad of paper
[2467.30 → 2468.30] And I would draw a circle on it
[2469.30 → 2471.30] And say this is a pie
[2472.30 → 2473.30] That represents all the chaos
[2474.30 → 2475.30] In your relationship
[2475.30 → 2479.30] Now 100% of all the blame
[2480.30 → 2481.30] Is represented in this pie
[2482.30 → 2483.30] This is where all the problem is
[2484.30 → 2485.30] And then he would
[2486.30 → 2487.30] Excuse me, he would give them a pen
[2488.30 → 2489.30] And say
[2490.30 → 2491.30] I want you to draw
[2492.30 → 2493.30] A slice of the pie
[2494.30 → 2496.30] That you think represents your responsibility
[2497.30 → 2498.30] For all the problems
[2499.30 → 2500.30] And of course, you know
[2500.30 → 2502.30] The piece of the pie that they drew
[2503.30 → 2504.30] Would never be very big
[2505.30 → 2506.30] And then he would say
[2506.30 → 2507.30] Okay, so
[2507.30 → 2509.30] Why don't we talk about that?
[2510.30 → 2511.30] Let's just focus on
[2512.30 → 2513.30] That slice of the pie
[2514.30 → 2515.30] However big it is
[2516.30 → 2517.30] That you are responsible for
[2518.30 → 2519.30] Right? Let's talk about your slice of the pie
[2520.30 → 2521.30] And he says, you know
[2522.30 → 2523.30] My approach never worked
[2524.30 → 2526.30] I can never get anybody to stay focused
[2526.30 → 2528.30] On his or her slice of the pie
[2529.30 → 2531.30] And in the same way
[2532.30 → 2533.30] Our relationship with God
[2534.30 → 2536.30] Can be represented by a pie
[2537.30 → 2539.30] And God wants you
[2540.30 → 2543.30] To focus on your slice of the pie
[2544.30 → 2546.30] And if you were going to draw that slice
[2547.30 → 2548.30] What would it look like?
[2549.30 → 2550.30] It's a big one
[2551.30 → 2553.30] In fact, if we are honest
[2553.30 → 2554.30] It's the entire slice
[2554.30 → 2555.30] It's the entire slice
[2556.30 → 2557.30] It's the entire pie
[2557.30 → 2558.30] Right? 100% of it
[2559.30 → 2560.30] Is our responsibility
[2561.30 → 2563.30] And so Paul continues in verse 21
[2564.30 → 2565.30] And he says
[2566.30 → 2567.30] We'll put it up on the screen
[2568.30 → 2570.30] Once you are alienated from God
[2571.30 → 2572.30] And were enemies in your minds
[2573.30 → 2574.30] Why?
[2575.30 → 2576.30] Because of your evil behaviour
[2577.30 → 2578.30] Right?
[2579.30 → 2580.30] Because of your evil behaviour
[2581.30 → 2582.30] That's why we're alienated from God
[2582.30 → 2583.30] That's why we're enemies with God
[2583.30 → 2584.30] That's why we're enemies with God
[2585.30 → 2586.30] So we need to ask ourselves
[2587.30 → 2590.30] Have I taken responsibility for my sin
[2591.30 → 2593.30] That is causing the chaos and the brokenness
[2594.30 → 2595.30] In my relationship with God?
[2596.30 → 2600.30] Or am I pointing fingers at someone else?
[2601.30 → 2602.30] Or making excuses?
[2603.30 → 2606.30] And friends, unless we get to the point where we can see
[2607.30 → 2609.30] That our slice is the whole pie
[2609.30 → 2614.30] That we will never have a breakthrough in our relationship with God
[2615.30 → 2618.30] But when we realize that we are more sinful
[2619.30 → 2620.30] That our slice is the whole thing
[2621.30 → 2623.30] More sinful than we ever dared to believe
[2624.30 → 2625.30] Once we realize that
[2626.30 → 2627.30] And own that
[2628.30 → 2631.30] Then we will have an incredible breakthrough in our relationship with God
[2631.30 → 2635.30] And we will be then astounded and amazed by the Gospel
[2636.30 → 2642.30] That though we are entirely at fault for the hostility and the enmity in our relationship with God
[2643.30 → 2647.30] Yet, nevertheless, God loves you, and He pursues you
[2648.30 → 2651.30] And He has done everything to bridge that relationship
[2651.30 → 2653.30] He has done everything to reconcile us to Himself
[2654.30 → 2659.30] So this is the need of reconciliation
[2660.30 → 2661.30] But God has done everything
[2661.30 → 2663.30] And so that leads us to the second point
[2664.30 → 2665.30] The way of reconciliation
[2666.30 → 2668.30] How did Jesus do everything?
[2669.30 → 2671.30] What did Jesus do to reconcile us to God?
[2672.30 → 2677.30] Because God didn't let Adam and Eve's decision to turn away from Him be the last word
[2677.30 → 2678.30] What is the last word?
[2679.30 → 2681.30] God spoke another word
[2682.30 → 2685.30] He made a promise that one day through the seed of the woman
[2686.30 → 2687.30] A Saviour would come
[2688.30 → 2691.30] And so in our passage in verse 20
[2692.30 → 2693.30] It says
[2694.30 → 2700.30] That the Saviour would come making peace through His bloodshed on the cross
[2701.30 → 2705.30] And what this means is that God took the initiative
[2705.30 → 2707.30] Right? God came to us
[2708.30 → 2711.30] God pursued us in His love
[2712.30 → 2713.30] And He provided the way
[2714.30 → 2716.30] And so what's the way of reconciliation that Paul talks about?
[2717.30 → 2722.30] When Paul talks here about this shedding of His blood on the cross
[2723.30 → 2728.30] He is clearly talking about the way that God's people have approached God
[2729.30 → 2731.30] Would always approach God in the Old Testament
[2731.30 → 2734.30] You know, and over the last few weeks we've been kind of looking at this in different ways
[2734.30 → 2736.30] But Paul talks about it here again
[2736.30 → 2738.30] So let's just look at it again briefly
[2739.30 → 2740.30] So again, in Israel
[2741.30 → 2742.30] In the tabernacle, then in the temple
[2743.30 → 2744.30] There was a place
[2745.30 → 2749.30] That was the place where God dwelt with His people
[2750.30 → 2752.30] God, we were separated from Him
[2752.30 → 2753.30] We were cast out of the garden
[2754.30 → 2755.30] But God pursued us
[2756.30 → 2758.30] He started to gather people for Himself
[2758.30 → 2761.30] It still wasn't perfect, the relationship
[2761.30 → 2763.30] But there was a process of healing going on
[2763.30 → 2765.30] And God would dwell in the midst of His people
[2766.30 → 2767.30] In the tabernacle
[2769.30 → 2771.30] And if you wanted to go and be with God
[2772.30 → 2773.30] To be in His presence
[2773.30 → 2776.30] To kind of, you know, put your sin away
[2777.30 → 2780.30] And to feel accepted by God
[2781.30 → 2782.30] And reconciled with Him
[2783.30 → 2784.30] You would go, and you would bring a sacrifice
[2784.30 → 2788.30] And so we see this all throughout the Old Testament
[2789.30 → 2790.30] But especially in Leviticus
[2790.30 → 2793.30] It's very specific about all of these ceremonies and rituals
[2794.30 → 2798.30] That were involved in restoring our relationship with God
[2799.30 → 2800.30] So I want to read a short passage
[2801.30 → 2802.30] Leviticus chapter 1
[2803.30 → 2805.30] So this is what it says right at the beginning of Leviticus
[2806.30 → 2807.30] It says,
[2807.30 → 2808.30] It says,
[2808.30 → 2809.30] It says,
[2809.30 → 2810.30] It says,
[2810.30 → 2811.30] It says,
[2811.30 → 2832.30] Okay, so to be restored in your relationship with God
[2832.30 → 2833.30] What you would do
[2833.30 → 2834.30] What you would do
[2835.30 → 2837.30] Is you would bring with you an animal sacrifice
[2838.30 → 2839.30] Like a goat
[2840.30 → 2843.30] And when you, then you would lay your hands on the goat
[2844.30 → 2846.30] And that means that it represented you
[2847.30 → 2848.30] And when you touch the sacrifice
[2849.30 → 2850.30] And when you lay your hands on it
[2851.30 → 2855.30] It says that it is accepted on your behalf
[2856.30 → 2859.30] In your place to make atonement for you
[2859.30 → 2861.30] To reconcile you
[2862.30 → 2863.30] To make you at one
[2864.30 → 2865.30] Atonement with God
[2866.30 → 2867.30] And the Bible tells us in other words
[2868.30 → 2869.30] See this is all these sacrifices
[2870.30 → 2872.30] When we then move forward and look at Colossians
[2872.30 → 2874.30] Paul is saying that to be a Christian
[2875.30 → 2876.30] That this is what it means
[2877.30 → 2878.30] This is what it means to be a Christian
[2879.30 → 2881.30] That you see that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice
[2882.30 → 2883.30] Without defect
[2884.30 → 2885.30] And it means that you spiritually
[2886.30 → 2887.30] You lay your hands upon Him
[2887.30 → 2888.30] Right?
[2888.30 → 2891.30] So just like every Israelite
[2892.30 → 2894.30] Who ever offered a sacrifice to God
[2895.30 → 2896.30] It's the same thing
[2896.30 → 2897.30] You lay your hands on Him
[2898.30 → 2901.30] And He gets what your sins deserve
[2902.30 → 2904.30] And now you can stand in God's presence
[2905.30 → 2906.30] Now you can be returned to God
[2907.30 → 2909.30] Because you are represented and accepted
[2910.30 → 2912.30] By the sacrifice by Jesus Christ
[2912.30 → 2915.30] And then that's why Paul says in verse 22
[2916.30 → 2917.30] He says
[2918.30 → 2922.30] But now He has reconciled you by Christ's physical body
[2923.30 → 2924.30] Through death
[2925.30 → 2926.30] To present you holy in His sight
[2927.30 → 2928.30] Without blemish and free from accusation
[2929.30 → 2930.30] Right?
[2930.30 → 2933.30] All of your sin was transferred to this spotless sacrifice
[2934.30 → 2936.30] So now you are presented without blemish
[2937.30 → 2938.30] You are presented as holy
[2939.30 → 2940.30] Free from accusation
[2940.30 → 2941.30] There is no more condemnation
[2941.30 → 2942.30] There is no more condemnation
[2943.30 → 2944.30] And notice this is present tense
[2945.30 → 2947.30] Now as a Christian when you put your faith in Christ
[2948.30 → 2951.30] You now stand holy in His sight
[2952.30 → 2955.30] So we were at enmity with God
[2956.30 → 2959.30] But on the cross Jesus shed His blood in our place
[2960.30 → 2961.30] So that we can have peace with God
[2961.30 → 2965.30] And if you trust in what He has done for you by faith
[2966.30 → 2968.30] If you will lay your hands upon Him
[2969.30 → 2971.30] You can be reconciled to God once again
[2972.30 → 2973.30] Okay, that's the way of reconciliation
[2974.30 → 2976.30] So now what is the result?
[2977.30 → 2979.30] So we have this word
[2980.30 → 2981.30] Well the result of course is reconciliation
[2982.30 → 2983.30] That's what we're talking about
[2984.30 → 2985.30] But this word to reconcile
[2986.30 → 2988.30] If you look it up in the Greek
[2988.30 → 2989.30] The Greek word, you know
[2989.30 → 2991.30] So it needs to be filled out a little bit
[2992.30 → 2993.30] What it actually means
[2993.30 → 2994.30] This word reconciled
[2995.30 → 2996.30] Means to be brought back again
[2997.30 → 2998.30] And you know I think we have a sense of what that
[2999.30 → 3000.30] This word in English
[3001.30 → 3002.30] Reconcile has that meaning
[3003.30 → 3004.30] Right?
[3005.30 → 3007.30] To reconcile means that something is to be brought back
[3008.30 → 3009.30] To a former state of harmony
[3009.30 → 3016.30] And so Jesus' death on the cross is about restoring the former state of harmony
[3017.30 → 3019.30] That God had created originally
[3020.30 → 3021.30] But here's the question
[3022.30 → 3026.30] What exactly does Paul say is being reconciled?
[3027.30 → 3028.30] Okay, what is being reconciled?
[3029.30 → 3033.30] In this passage where Paul is trying to teach us about the meaning of the gospel
[3034.30 → 3035.30] And what Jesus is doing
[3036.30 → 3037.30] What phrase does he use?
[3037.30 → 3038.30] What does he say?
[3038.30 → 3040.30] Let's look at verse 19 again
[3041.30 → 3046.30] For God was pleased to have all of his fullness to dwell in Jesus
[3047.30 → 3049.30] And through Jesus to reconcile to himself what?
[3050.30 → 3051.30] All things
[3052.30 → 3054.30] Whether things on heaven
[3055.30 → 3057.30] Things on earth or things in heaven
[3058.30 → 3061.30] So Paul is saying that the reconciliation of the gospel involves all things
[3062.30 → 3064.30] Right? Things on earth, things in heaven
[3064.30 → 3068.30] That means everything in all of God's creation
[3069.30 → 3073.30] Through the cross, God is reconciling to himself
[3074.30 → 3075.30] So let's think
[3076.30 → 3079.30] God made the world back in Genesis chapters 1 and 2
[3080.30 → 3083.30] And he said seven times in that chapter that it is good
[3084.30 → 3089.30] Right? The harmony that God had made with his creation was good
[3089.30 → 3090.30] Everything was in harmony
[3090.30 → 3091.30] Everything was in harmony
[3091.30 → 3092.30] Nothing was broken
[3092.30 → 3093.30] Everything was good
[3094.30 → 3095.30] But human beings sinned
[3096.30 → 3098.30] And when we did, we plunged not only ourselves
[3099.30 → 3101.30] But the whole creation into captivity
[3102.30 → 3106.30] Paul tells us in Romans that the creation itself is groaning
[3106.30 → 3109.30] So now we are estranged from God
[3109.30 → 3110.30] But we are also under his judgment
[3111.30 → 3118.30] But also we ourselves as people are broken messes
[3119.30 → 3120.30] We are broken messes
[3121.30 → 3122.30] We know that about ourselves
[3123.30 → 3127.30] Our relationships and our communities are destroyed
[3128.30 → 3130.30] And creation itself is in disarray
[3130.30 → 3133.30] The Bible says that we live under this terrible curse
[3134.30 → 3136.30] But then over and over again throughout the Bible
[3137.30 → 3138.30] Starting in Genesis 3
[3139.30 → 3140.30] God makes the promise that one day
[3141.30 → 3142.30] He is going to send a saviour
[3143.30 → 3145.30] That saviour is going to come and make everything new
[3146.30 → 3148.30] And all creation will be restored
[3149.30 → 3151.30] So that means harmony with God
[3152.30 → 3154.30] That we have with God as people will be restored
[3154.30 → 3159.30] But it also means that we as people can be made new
[3160.30 → 3161.30] As Paul says in 2 Corinthians
[3162.30 → 3163.30] New creations
[3164.30 → 3166.30] It means that human relationships can be healed
[3167.30 → 3169.30] And it means that the world itself can be restored
[3170.30 → 3172.30] That the desert of this world
[3173.30 → 3178.30] The curse that is under will blossom and flourish like an orchard
[3179.30 → 3182.30] So the Bible tells us that this is the promised future
[3182.30 → 3184.30] The restoration of all things
[3185.30 → 3186.30] And listen to this
[3187.30 → 3189.30] Paul says we can be a part of it
[3190.30 → 3193.30] Right? That's why he moves from verse 20
[3194.30 → 3195.30] Talking about Christ reconciling all things
[3196.30 → 3197.30] To then verse 21
[3198.30 → 3200.30] Talking about how Christ reconciles us
[3201.30 → 3205.30] So there is this incredible grace of personal reconciliation
[3206.30 → 3211.30] Paul says Jesus reconciles individual sinners to God through his cross
[3212.30 → 3214.30] God came to save sinners
[3215.30 → 3216.30] Who truly need to be reconciled to God
[3217.30 → 3221.30] By grace through faith in Christ shed blood for them
[3222.30 → 3223.30] But
[3224.30 → 3227.30] Jesus also came to do other things as well
[3228.30 → 3231.30] Jesus has come to restore and redeem all things to himself
[3232.30 → 3236.30] So that the God and Paul talks about this in the verses before what we read
[3236.30 → 3243.30] He says how God who created all things in Christ came to indwell all things in this world he made
[3244.30 → 3248.30] And now is reconciling all things by his grace through Christ
[3249.30 → 3250.30] That's the movement of the passage
[3251.30 → 3252.30] God through Christ created all things
[3253.30 → 3255.30] God in Christ indwelt all things
[3255.30 → 3260.30] And because through Christ he wants to redeem all things
[3261.30 → 3262.30] In heaven and on earth
[3263.30 → 3266.30] Now why is this such good news?
[3267.30 → 3273.30] It's because it is at the same time both humbling and exciting
[3274.30 → 3279.30] Okay, what God is doing through Jesus' death on the cross is bigger than you
[3279.30 → 3281.30] So it is humbling
[3282.30 → 3283.30] And yet
[3284.30 → 3285.30] You get to be a part of it
[3286.30 → 3287.30] That's exciting
[3288.30 → 3289.30] If you put your faith in Christ
[3289.30 → 3290.30] It's not just about you, it's about all things
[3291.30 → 3292.30] But you get to be a part of it
[3293.30 → 3296.30] And what this means for us individually and for us as a church
[3297.30 → 3299.30] Is that there is no part of creation that God doesn't care about
[3300.30 → 3303.30] Because Jesus cares for all of it
[3303.30 → 3308.30] And that means as Christians we can work to restore spiritual brokenness in the world
[3309.30 → 3312.30] And we can also work to restore social brokenness in the world
[3313.30 → 3317.30] It means that we can get out there and seek for people to be reconciled to God
[3318.30 → 3326.30] And we can get out there to work for reconciliation between races, between families, between marriages and in neighbours
[3327.30 → 3330.30] Because Jesus is reconciling all things to himself
[3330.30 → 3332.30] So on the cross
[3333.30 → 3334.30] It's not just about you
[3335.30 → 3336.30] It's about all things
[3337.30 → 3338.30] But it's also about you
[3339.30 → 3340.30] It's about me
[3341.30 → 3343.30] Because Jesus loves you, and he loves the world
[3344.30 → 3345.30] Would you pray with me?
[3349.30 → 3351.30] Lord, we thank you for this expansive
[3351.30 → 3358.30] Beautiful sight that you have given us
[3359.30 → 3360.30] In Colossians 1
[3361.30 → 3363.30] That we can look at this, and we can step back
[3364.30 → 3367.30] And we can see your plan for the entire universe
[3368.30 → 3370.30] Your plan to take everything that was broken
[3371.30 → 3374.30] And to restore it all through Jesus' death at one point in history
[3375.30 → 3377.30] That would undo the curse
[3377.30 → 3380.30] And would turn the world right side up again
[3381.30 → 3383.30] And Lord, because you love us
[3384.30 → 3385.30] You want us to be a part of this
[3386.30 → 3390.30] You want, you pursued us to restore us to relationship with yourself
[3391.30 → 3395.30] And Lord, you also in doing so make us agents of renewal in the world
[3396.30 → 3397.30] You make us ambassadors of Christ
[3397.30 → 3399.30] And Lord, would you help us
[3400.30 → 3402.30] To seek reconciliation with you
[3403.30 → 3404.30] With others
[3405.30 → 3406.30] And in this world, wherever we find it
[3407.30 → 3408.30] Lord, help us by your spirit
[3409.30 → 3410.30] We pray in Jesus' name, Amen
[3411.30 → 3414.30] So let's sing our song of response
[3414.30 → 3415.30] A song of response
[3415.30 → 3416.30] For the word of God the Father
[3416.30 → 3417.30] From before the world began
[3418.30 → 3421.30] The word of God the Father
[3422.30 → 3425.30] From before the world began
[3425.30 → 3434.78] Oh, the word of God the Father
[3434.78 → 3438.62] From before the world began
[3438.62 → 3442.72] Every star and every planet
[3442.72 → 3447.16] Has been fashioned by your hand
[3447.16 → 3450.60] All creation holds together
[3450.60 → 3455.18] By the power of your voice
[3455.18 → 3458.82] Let the skies declare your glory
[3458.82 → 3463.00] Let the land and seas rejoice
[3463.00 → 3466.58] O the author of creation
[3466.58 → 3470.64] O the Lord of everyone
[3470.64 → 3474.30] And your cry of love rings out
[3474.30 → 3477.54] Across the lands
[3477.54 → 3482.80] Yet you left the gaze of angels
[3482.80 → 3486.70] Aim to seek and save the lost
[3486.70 → 3490.62] And exchange the joy of heaven
[3490.62 → 3494.42] For the anguish of our cross
[3494.42 → 3498.16] With a prayer you fed the hungry
[3498.16 → 3502.06] With a word you calm the sea
[3502.06 → 3505.98] Yet how silently you suffer
[3505.98 → 3509.98] That the guilty may hold free
[3509.98 → 3513.94] You're the author of creation
[3513.94 → 3517.58] You're the Lord of everyone
[3517.58 → 3521.62] And your cry of love rings out
[3521.62 → 3524.86] Across the lands
[3524.86 → 3529.76] With a shout you rose victorious
[3529.76 → 3534.18] Resting victory from the grave
[3534.18 → 3538.10] And ascended into heaven
[3538.10 → 3541.86] Leading captives in your way
[3541.86 → 3545.76] Now you stand before the Father
[3545.76 → 3549.94] Interceding for your all
[3549.94 → 3553.84] From each tribe and tongue and nation
[3553.84 → 3557.90] You are leading sinners home
[3557.90 → 3561.60] You're the author of creation
[3561.60 → 3565.58] You're the Lord of everyone
[3565.58 → 3569.48] And your cry of love rings out
[3569.48 → 3572.48] Across the lands
[3572.48 → 3581.64] In our prayer this morning
[3581.64 → 3583.30] Before we go to God in prayer
[3583.30 → 3585.48] I'd just like to let you know
[3585.48 → 3588.24] That Jake's mom, Annie
[3588.24 → 3591.96] Has had some reprieve
[3591.96 → 3593.44] And she's feeling much better
[3593.44 → 3594.64] Than she was
[3594.64 → 3596.58] And our prayers have been answered
[3596.58 → 3598.78] Her prognosis is also very hopeful
[3598.78 → 3601.32] So for that we praise and thank God
[3601.32 → 3603.20] Let's go to God in prayer
[3603.20 → 3607.04] Lord, our Lord
[3607.04 → 3609.26] How majestic is your name
[3609.26 → 3609.96] In all the earth
[3609.96 → 3613.62] We thank you for this season of new life
[3613.62 → 3615.52] Spring that refreshes us
[3615.52 → 3616.94] With its unfolding beauty
[3616.94 → 3620.60] How incredible your creative works are
[3620.60 → 3622.82] The stars at night
[3622.82 → 3624.28] The budding trees
[3624.28 → 3626.66] And snow-capped mountains by day
[3626.66 → 3629.84] You are holy, O God of majesty
[3629.84 → 3633.44] And blessed is Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord
[3633.44 → 3637.02] As one of us, he knew our joys and sorrows
[3637.02 → 3638.94] And our struggles with temptation
[3638.94 → 3642.48] He was like us in every way except sin
[3642.48 → 3646.32] In him we see what you created us to be
[3646.32 → 3648.62] Though blameless he suffered
[3648.62 → 3651.18] And died willingly for our sin
[3651.18 → 3654.12] On the cross he offered himself
[3654.12 → 3656.00] A perfect sacrifice for the life
[3656.00 → 3657.16] And freedom of the world
[3657.16 → 3659.34] Risen from the grave
[3659.34 → 3662.36] He leads us to the joy of new life
[3662.36 → 3665.34] We come to you boldly
[3665.34 → 3667.34] Because of the work Jesus has done
[3667.34 → 3670.14] You are the great physician
[3670.14 → 3672.24] So we bring before you
[3672.24 → 3673.42] Those who are sick
[3673.42 → 3677.30] Lord, we ask for pain to subside
[3677.30 → 3679.38] Illness to be cured
[3679.38 → 3681.92] For patience in suffering
[3681.92 → 3684.14] And for great compassion
[3684.14 → 3685.22] From this community
[3685.22 → 3688.22] We bring especially before you
[3688.22 → 3689.18] Kim and George
[3689.18 → 3691.82] And the family members that sit with them
[3691.82 → 3696.32] As Kim is given palliative care at home
[3696.32 → 3698.66] Lord, have mercy
[3698.66 → 3700.48] And bring grace
[3700.48 → 3702.24] In those moments
[3702.24 → 3706.22] Even as we walk
[3706.22 → 3708.24] Through the valley of the shadow of death
[3708.24 → 3709.86] You are with us
[3709.86 → 3712.38] We praise you
[3712.38 → 3714.22] For the updated encouraging prognosis
[3714.74 → 3716.42] Given to Annie, Jake's mother
[3716.42 → 3717.92] We praise you
[3717.92 → 3719.64] Not only for what you do
[3719.64 → 3722.00] But for who you are, Lord
[3722.00 → 3723.62] For you have promised never
[3723.62 → 3725.42] To leave or forsake us
[3725.42 → 3728.80] We bring to you those who are lonely
[3728.80 → 3731.20] It's easy to feel forgotten
[3731.20 → 3733.08] As we are separated from one another
[3733.08 → 3735.70] May we all take part as a community
[3735.70 → 3736.72] To call each other
[3736.72 → 3738.38] And to call on those
[3738.38 → 3739.48] Who would love a smile
[3739.48 → 3741.48] And an encouraging word
[3741.48 → 3744.40] Blessed are those who mourn
[3744.40 → 3745.06] You said
[3745.06 → 3746.74] Comfort them
[3746.74 → 3750.48] Lift those struggling with grief
[3750.48 → 3751.48] Of all kinds
[3751.48 → 3754.04] Almighty, powerful God
[3754.04 → 3755.24] Remind us always
[3755.24 → 3756.96] That you are on your throne
[3756.96 → 3758.90] That you have defeated evil
[3758.90 → 3760.64] No matter what our eyes see
[3760.64 → 3762.38] Of conflict and broken spirits
[3762.38 → 3764.20] Bodies and even entire nations
[3764.20 → 3767.06] We trust that the wounds of Christ
[3767.06 → 3767.84] Are sufficient
[3767.84 → 3770.58] For the redemption of all creation
[3770.58 → 3774.60] Continue to be with this church, Lord
[3774.60 → 3777.32] With Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy
[3777.32 → 3777.98] And Hannah
[3777.98 → 3780.60] May our words to them be uplifting
[3780.60 → 3782.32] And may we always be ready
[3782.32 → 3783.56] To encourage one another
[3783.56 → 3785.80] To do the work you have planned for us to do
[3785.80 → 3788.50] In humility and selflessness
[3788.50 → 3791.84] Lead us, O God, in the way of Christ
[3791.84 → 3794.62] Give us courage to take up our cross
[3794.62 → 3797.46] And in full reliance upon your grace
[3797.46 → 3798.38] To follow him
[3798.38 → 3801.64] Help us to love you above all else
[3801.64 → 3802.54] And to love our neighbour
[3802.54 → 3803.94] As we love ourselves
[3803.94 → 3806.80] Demonstrating that love in deed and word
[3806.80 → 3808.26] By the power of your spirit
[3808.26 → 3811.82] Give us strength to serve you faithfully
[3811.82 → 3813.88] Until the promised day of resurrection
[3813.88 → 3816.68] When, with the redeemed of all ages
[3816.68 → 3818.30] We will feast with you
[3818.30 → 3820.10] At your table in glory
[3820.10 → 3822.08] Through Christ
[3822.08 → 3824.04] All glory and honour are yours
[3824.04 → 3824.92] Almighty Father
[3824.92 → 3826.40] With the Holy Spirit
[3826.40 → 3827.70] In the Holy Church
[3827.70 → 3828.46] Now and forever
[3828.46 → 3830.30] Come quickly, Lord Jesus
[3830.30 → 3831.48] Amen
[3831.48 → 3839.86] So brothers and sisters
[3839.86 → 3840.34] We
[3840.34 → 3843.80] Come to the end of our time of worship together
[3843.80 → 3844.62] But we go
[3844.62 → 3846.52] Forth into the world
[3846.52 → 3848.84] As agents of reconciliation
[3848.84 → 3850.30] With first
[3850.30 → 3852.50] The blessing of our Heavenly Father
[3852.50 → 3854.00] The delight of God
[3854.00 → 3855.18] Upon us
[3855.18 → 3857.14] Because we have been restored to him
[3857.14 → 3857.70] Through Christ
[3857.70 → 3859.50] So I invite you to hold out your hands
[3859.50 → 3861.70] And receive these words of blessing
[3861.70 → 3864.02] Now to him who is able
[3864.02 → 3865.90] To do far more abundantly
[3865.90 → 3867.54] Than all that we ask or think
[3867.54 → 3870.40] According to the power at work within us
[3870.40 → 3872.64] To him be glory in the church
[3872.64 → 3873.74] And in Christ Jesus
[3873.74 → 3875.58] Throughout all generations
[3875.58 → 3877.60] Forever and ever
[3877.60 → 3878.70] Amen
[3889.50 → 3891.50] Father in heaven
[3891.50 → 3891.52] Father in heaven
[3891.52 → 3894.66] How we love you
[3894.66 → 3902.00] We lift your name in all the earth
[3902.00 → 3908.64] May your kingdom be established in our praises
[3908.64 → 3916.38] As your people declare your mighty words
[3916.38 → 3923.38] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[3923.38 → 3930.78] Who was in his and is to come
[3930.78 → 3938.58] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[3938.58 → 3945.58] Who reigns forevermore
[3945.58 → 3953.90] Father of mercy be exalted
[3953.90 → 3961.36] In Jesus' name be lifted high
[3961.36 → 3965.88] For the sacrifice of love
[3965.88 → 3966.92] For the sacrifice of love
[3966.92 → 3969.88] Has won my pardon
[3969.88 → 3974.68] And his resurrection power
[3974.68 → 3977.52] Gives me life
[3977.52 → 3984.88] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[3984.88 → 3991.88] Who was in his and is to come
[3991.88 → 3999.88] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[3999.88 → 4006.88] Who reigns forevermore
[4006.88 → 4021.88] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[4021.88 → 4023.88] Who was in his and is to come
[4023.88 → 4028.88] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[4028.88 → 4039.64] Almighty, who reigns forevermore.
[4058.88 → 4060.88] Amen.
