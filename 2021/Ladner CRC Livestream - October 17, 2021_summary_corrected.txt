• The Psalms of Ascent are a collection of 15 psalms
• They were sung by Israelites on their way to Jerusalem for annual festivals
• The psalms reflect the journey and pilgrimage to worship in the temple
• The original context is one of travel, danger, and seeking God's presence
• The psalms can also be seen as discipleship psalms, discussing life as a journey with Jesus
• Examples are given to illustrate how people take common things for granted
• The speaker reflects on the wonder and amazement that should be felt when worshipping God
• The importance of maintaining a sense of awe and reverence for God's splendour, mercy, and greatness
• Psalm 134 is discussed as an invitation to experience a life of amazement, praise, and worship
• The psalm was likely sung at the end of a worship service in the temple during the pilgrims' visit
• The refrain "Praise the Lord" is highlighted as a short but powerful song that can be sung on one's journey back home

• Discussion of whether it's dishonest or disingenuous to lift hands in worship without feeling a heart connection
• Explaining that the psalm says "Lift your hands" even if one doesn't feel a heart connection, because God made humans as body and soul with no separation between the two
• John Calvin's quote on lifting hands when praying being a way to raise one's heart to God simultaneously
• Emphasis on worshipping even without feeling like it, because God is worthy of praise and hearts will follow as we put ourselves in the way of worship
• Worship in the temple was a continuous process, with Levites and priests working in shifts around the clock

• Examples of God's blessing in biblical context (Genesis 22)
• Abraham's ascension to the hill where he planned to sacrifice Isaac
• The hill is actually a place of worship, not sacrifice
• Abraham's obedience and faith in God are being tested
• Abraham tells his servants to stay behind while he takes Isaac up the mountain to worship
• Abraham says he will come back to them, but it is actually a test of his faith and willingness to obey God
• Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac as an offering to God
• God intervened and provided a ram as the sacrifice instead of Isaac
• The story echoes throughout the Bible as a pointer to God's willingness to provide His own sacrifice, not humanity's
• The sacrifice is seen in Jesus Christ, where God sacrificed His own Son for humanity's sins
• Worship is giving God himself to us
• The focus of worship is not what we give, but what God gives to us
• God's sufficient in himself and doesn't need our sacrifices or offerings
• He owns everything and doesn't benefit from our bulls and goats
• The idea of sacrifice is a way of thinking about the relationship between God and humans
• The concept of sacrifice in worship, particularly the idea that God gives Himself to men through these sacrifices.
• C.S. Lewis' essay on praising God and the essence of a sacrifice in Judaism.
• The distinction between man giving to God versus God giving Himself to men through their actions.
• The true nature of sacrifice as an act of worship where God involves humans in His own essential act.
• God gives blessings that we can't earn or deserve
• God is gracious and gives far more than we could ask for
• Discipleship is a journey of following Jesus in the ups and downs of life
• It's not easy, but the final word is blessing from God
• God blesses us with His presence, power to sustain, salvation, commitment, and movement towards us, always of grace
• Worship and reverence for God
