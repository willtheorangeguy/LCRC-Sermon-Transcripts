[282.00 → 285.00] Good morning.
[285.00 → 286.00] Good morning.
[286.00 → 287.00] Good morning.
[287.00 → 294.36] We'd like to welcome you all to Ladder Christian Reformed Church, for all those that are here
[294.36 → 300.08] with us in the sanctuary and also for those that are joining us on the live stream.
[300.24 → 300.52] Welcome.
[301.46 → 305.20] My name is John and I will be leading the service this morning.
[305.66 → 308.96] Pastor Jason will be bringing us the word this morning.
[309.78 → 312.88] We invite you to a time of fellowship after the service.
[313.54 → 320.30] Refreshments will be served in the fellowship room, which is straight to the back of the
[320.30 → 320.70] sanctuary.
[320.70 → 325.28] So you're free to grab your coffee and if you want to come out in the foyer to go outside
[325.28 → 329.14] to feel more comfortable, you're welcome to do so to enjoy your coffee.
[330.08 → 333.10] Our offering this morning is for Servants Anonymous.
[334.54 → 341.14] Servants Anonymous provides long-term care, housing, recovery, and training for women and
[341.14 → 345.42] their children escaping from human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
[345.42 → 351.76] The local director of Servants Anonymous, Theo Lauder, preached in our church a few Sundays
[351.76 → 352.20] ago.
[352.92 → 354.86] So he spoke about the ministry at that time.
[354.94 → 356.10] So he's a local director.
[356.78 → 358.24] This is a worldwide organization.
[358.24 → 369.12] So as usual, we're not taking offering in person yet, but online and I think we all know how
[369.12 → 370.76] it's done now after a year and a half.
[372.92 → 375.32] Could I ask you to rise, please, for our call to worship?
[375.32 → 384.50] Our call to worship comes from Matthew 11, verses 28 and 29.
[384.50 → 391.02] Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[391.70 → 398.60] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will
[398.60 → 400.64] find rest for your souls.
[400.64 → 406.20] And now God's greeting comes to us from Jude 1, verse 2.
[407.40 → 413.36] To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ,
[414.16 → 417.62] mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[419.72 → 425.64] Now as God has greeted us, let's just greet each other with a wave or a hello or...
[425.64 → 449.46] So I'm going to call the music team up.
[451.32 → 452.32] Please be seated.
[452.32 → 453.32] Please.
[453.32 → 454.32] I don't worry.
[454.32 → 455.32] No, no.
[455.32 → 456.32] What?
[456.32 → 457.32] What do I know?
[457.32 → 460.42] What do I know?
[460.42 → 461.42] What do I know?
[461.42 → 462.42] I know.
[462.42 → 463.42] I know.
[463.42 → 464.42] I know.
[464.42 → 465.42] But I know.
[465.42 → 466.42] I know.
[466.42 → 467.42] I know.
[467.42 → 468.42] I know.
[468.42 → 469.42] I know.
[469.42 → 489.82] From the depths of the sea
[489.82 → 494.32] From the heights of the heavens
[494.32 → 497.14] Your name we pray
[497.14 → 502.18] From the hearts of the weak
[502.18 → 506.38] From the shouts of the strong
[506.38 → 510.62] From the lips of all people
[510.62 → 515.28] This song we raise, Lord
[515.28 → 519.82] Throughout the endless ages
[519.82 → 524.58] You will be crowned with praises, Lord
[524.58 → 527.58] Most high
[527.58 → 531.94] Exalted in every nation
[531.94 → 536.82] Soren of all creation, Lord
[536.82 → 538.94] Most high
[538.94 → 540.62] Be magnified
[540.62 → 544.58] Be magnified
[544.58 → 551.58] From the depths of the sea
[551.58 → 556.58] From the depths of the sea
[556.58 → 560.58] From the heights of the heavens
[560.58 → 564.58] Your name we pray
[564.58 → 569.62] From the hearts of the weak
[569.62 → 571.38] From the shouts of the strong
[571.38 → 575.62] From the lips of all people
[575.62 → 577.74] From the lips of all people
[577.74 → 582.62] This song we raise, Lord
[582.62 → 587.66] Throughout the endless ages
[587.66 → 591.66] You will be crowned with praises, Lord
[591.66 → 594.66] Most high
[594.66 → 598.66] Exalted in every nation
[598.66 → 603.66] Sovereign of all creation, Lord
[603.66 → 604.66] Lord
[604.66 → 606.66] Most high
[606.66 → 610.66] Be magnified
[610.66 → 614.66] Be magnified
[614.66 → 618.64] Sovereign of all 감
[618.64 → 619.66] Be magnified
[619.66 → 621.66] You are with Vile
[621.66 → 623.66] Be magnified
[623.66 → 625.66] You must have a heart
[625.66 → 626.66] Be magnified
[626.66 → 627.66] You may blame
[627.66 → 630.26] Have a large
[630.26 → 631.50] Be magnified
[631.50 → 632.52] You may blame
[633.86 → 635.16] You may believe
[635.16 → 649.82] As morning dawns and evening haves
[649.82 → 656.16] We'll inspire songs of praise
[656.16 → 662.66] That rise from earth to touch your heart
[662.66 → 668.12] And glorify your name
[668.12 → 675.14] Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[675.14 → 681.78] Your name is a shelter like no other
[681.78 → 688.48] Your name let the nations sing it louder
[688.48 → 693.94] As nothing has a power to say
[693.94 → 697.40] But your name
[697.40 → 707.86] Jesus in your name we pray
[707.86 → 714.86] Come and fill our hearts today
[714.86 → 721.32] Lord give us strength to live for you
[721.32 → 727.32] And glorify your name
[727.32 → 734.32] Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[734.32 → 739.78] And glorify your name
[739.78 → 740.78] And glorify your name
[740.78 → 743.78] And glorify your name
[743.78 → 747.78] Let the nations sing it louder
[747.78 → 752.78] There's nothing has a power to say
[752.78 → 757.24] But your name
[757.24 → 764.38] This next song we're going to sing is actually a new one.
[764.92 → 769.52] We had sung it a couple of times last year, but I wanted to make sure we properly learn it.
[769.64 → 774.38] So it's based off Psalm 34, so I'm just going to read that passage to you.
[774.38 → 777.98] I will extol the Lord at all times
[777.98 → 780.04] His praise will always be on my lips
[780.04 → 782.28] My soul will boast in the Lord
[782.28 → 784.42] Let the afflicted hear and rejoice
[784.42 → 786.48] Glorify the Lord with me
[786.48 → 788.34] Let us exalt his name together
[788.34 → 791.16] I sought the Lord, and he answered me
[791.16 → 793.52] He delivered me from all my fears
[793.52 → 795.94] Those who look to him are radiant
[795.94 → 798.82] Their faces are never covered with shame
[798.82 → 801.76] The poor man called, and the Lord heard him
[801.76 → 804.04] He saved him out of all his troubles
[804.04 → 807.50] The angels of the Lord encamp around those who fear him
[807.50 → 808.80] And he delivers them
[808.80 → 812.00] Taste and see that the Lord is good
[812.00 → 814.54] Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him
[814.54 → 816.80] Fear the Lord, you saints
[816.80 → 818.86] For those who fear lack nothing
[818.86 → 821.26] The lion may grow weary and weak
[821.26 → 823.00] Sorry, grow weak and hungry
[823.00 → 825.92] But those who seek the Lord lack no good thing
[825.92 → 828.42] The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous
[828.42 → 830.66] His ears are attentive to their cry
[830.66 → 833.70] The face of the Lord is against those who do evil
[833.70 → 836.90] To cut off the memory of them from the earth
[836.90 → 839.46] The righteous cry out and the Lord hears them
[839.46 → 841.54] He delivers them from all their troubles
[841.54 → 844.38] The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
[844.38 → 846.86] And he saves those who are crushed in spirit
[846.86 → 849.66] A righteous man may have many troubles
[849.66 → 851.66] But the Lord delivers them from them all
[851.66 → 857.42] I sought the Lord
[857.42 → 860.66] And he answered me
[860.66 → 861.42] And delivered me
[861.42 → 865.42] I sought the Lord
[865.42 → 871.36] And he answered me
[871.36 → 881.36] And delivered me
[881.36 → 882.36] And delivered me
[882.36 → 886.36] From every fear
[886.36 → 890.36] Those who look on him
[890.36 → 893.36] Are radiant
[893.36 → 898.36] They'll never be ashamed
[898.36 → 902.36] They'll never be ashamed
[902.36 → 907.36] This poor man cried
[907.36 → 909.36] And the Lord could be
[909.36 → 910.36] And saved me
[910.36 → 914.36] And saved me
[914.36 → 919.36] From my enemies
[919.36 → 924.36] The Son of God
[924.36 → 928.36] Surround this place
[928.36 → 930.36] You will deliver them
[930.36 → 931.36] You will deliver them
[931.36 → 933.36] You will deliver them
[933.36 → 937.36] You will deliver them
[937.36 → 947.36] May be fly, the Lord with me
[947.56 → 950.36] For his soldiers stay together
[950.36 → 962.36] Together, the reply will go in the name.
[963.36 → 969.36] God's the world is made forever.
[971.36 → 978.36] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[978.36 → 986.36] Oh, blessed is He who hides in Him.
[987.36 → 991.36] Oh, fear the Lord.
[992.36 → 998.36] Oh, all you saints, He'll give you everything.
[999.36 → 1003.36] He'll give you everything.
[1003.36 → 1011.36] May we find the Lord with me.
[1012.36 → 1020.36] God exalts His name together.
[1020.36 → 1028.36] Glorify the Lord with me.
[1029.36 → 1035.36] God exalts His name forever.
[1035.36 → 1050.36] Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[1050.36 → 1054.36] Never-ending praise.
[1055.36 → 1059.36] May our incense rise.
[1059.36 → 1067.36] Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[1067.36 → 1072.36] Never-ending praise.
[1072.36 → 1076.36] May our incense rise.
[1076.36 → 1083.36] May defy the glory of me.
[1083.36 → 1085.36] God exalts His name forever.
[1085.36 → 1088.36] God exalts His name forever.
[1088.36 → 1090.36] Lord Saviour.
[1090.36 → 1094.36] Lord praise the Lord with me.
[1094.36 → 1098.36] God exalts His name forever.
[1098.36 → 1099.36] Torments rise.
[1099.36 → 1102.36] Fa'er ever-ending praise.
[1102.36 → 1109.36] and exalt his name forever.
[1126.96 → 1131.86] I'd like you to join me in our prayer of confession.
[1131.86 → 1137.54] It's follow along on the overhead, and then the last portion where it says family,
[1137.74 → 1139.68] that we could all say that together.
[1142.02 → 1147.68] Merciful God, you pardon all who truly repent and turn to you.
[1148.12 → 1151.24] We humbly confess our sins and ask for your mercy.
[1152.16 → 1157.20] We have not loved you with a pure heart, nor have we loved our neighbour as ourselves.
[1157.20 → 1163.88] We have not done justice, loved kindness, or walked humbly with you, our God.
[1165.08 → 1172.24] Have mercy in us, O God, in your loving kindness, in your great compassion, cleanse us from our sin.
[1172.24 → 1181.28] Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.
[1182.04 → 1187.60] Do not cast us from your presence, or take your Holy Spirit from us.
[1188.50 → 1195.14] Restore to us the joy of your salvation, and sustain us with your bountiful spirit.
[1195.14 → 1198.76] Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[1198.76 → 1208.52] And now the assurance of pardon, which is based on Psalm 130, which is one of the Psalms of Ascent.
[1208.52 → 1215.14] If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?
[1215.90 → 1219.82] But there is forgiveness with you, so that you may be revered.
[1220.40 → 1222.50] O Israel, hope in the Lord.
[1223.26 → 1228.74] For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is great power to redeem.
[1229.60 → 1233.50] It is he who will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
[1238.52 → 1265.08] Just as I am without one plea,
[1265.08 → 1272.82] God, that the other blood was shared for me,
[1272.82 → 1291.20] And that thou beards me up to thee, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
[1291.20 → 1300.68] Just as I am the just of hope,
[1300.94 → 1304.72] With man you come, with man you come,
[1304.72 → 1308.66] With man you come, with man you come,
[1308.66 → 1313.38] Thy dreams and fears come,
[1313.38 → 1327.12] Lead me, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
[1327.12 → 1334.86] Just as I am the way,
[1334.86 → 1336.86] Just as I am the way,
[1336.86 → 1339.86] Will God come,
[1339.86 → 1344.80] And as we leave,
[1344.80 → 1349.72] Because I promise,
[1349.72 → 1363.46] I believe, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
[1363.46 → 1379.20] As I am the love,
[1379.20 → 1392.94] As I am the love,
[1392.94 → 1396.68] As I am the love,
[1396.68 → 1410.30] For God, I come, I come, I come.
[1410.30 → 1412.42] As I am the love,
[1412.42 → 1414.92] I am the love,
[1414.92 → 1420.68] I come, I come.
[1420.68 → 1436.00] At this time we'd like to dismiss the kids' life children from age 3 to grade 7 and along
[1436.00 → 1441.92] with their teachers. So we bless you on your way that you have a blast of time with the
[1441.92 → 1443.18] students.
[1450.68 → 1477.38] Psalm 126, a song of essence. When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like
[1477.38 → 1482.60] those who dreamed. Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy.
[1483.22 → 1488.90] Then it was said among the nations, the Lord has done great things for them. The Lord has
[1488.90 → 1495.04] done great things for us, and we are filled with joy. Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams
[1495.04 → 1501.40] in the Negev. Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy. Those who go out weeping,
[1501.40 → 1508.40] carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them. This
[1508.40 → 1509.62] is the word of the Lord.
[1510.36 → 1511.40] Thank you, John.
[1511.40 → 1524.82] Thank you, John. So as I mentioned last week, we're trying a new thing and encouraging any
[1524.82 → 1532.94] of you who would like to, and maybe some of you who I will call on, be ready, to read the
[1532.94 → 1537.82] scripture for us, and we'll try that and see if it kind of adds to our life together and
[1537.82 → 1543.18] our worship. And so during this summer, we've been going through a series called Songs for
[1543.18 → 1548.14] the Journey, right? And we've been looking at the Psalms of Ascent. It's a beautiful collection
[1548.14 → 1556.08] of psalms in the Psalter, 15 psalms. And they're often known as the travel psalms because they
[1556.08 → 1560.96] were the songs that God's people sang every year, three times a year, as they made their
[1560.96 → 1568.48] way up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple and to feast with God's people. And as travel
[1568.48 → 1578.56] songs, they remind us that life is a journey. And in this journey, there are peaks and there
[1578.56 → 1585.58] are valleys, right? There are peaks, these mountaintop experiences where things are going
[1585.58 → 1594.12] great in life. But we also know that in life, there are valleys where things are really hard,
[1594.30 → 1600.72] where things, when things are difficult. And yet, even with that reality in mind, right,
[1600.74 → 1607.10] that there is much in life that is fraught with difficulty, today's Psalm, Psalm 126, dares
[1607.10 → 1614.02] to say something pretty radical. Because it dares to say that one of the key marks of the Christian
[1614.02 → 1620.86] pilgrim on this journey of discipleship, of following Jesus in this life, the mark of a
[1620.86 → 1629.94] Christian pilgrim is joy. That a person who is following Jesus will be a person marked by joy.
[1630.50 → 1636.52] That's what the psalm is all about, and we're calling it the song of joy. And so let me pray for
[1636.52 → 1643.82] us as we look at God's word together. Would you pray with me? Heavenly Father, we come to you this
[1643.82 → 1653.80] morning, each one of us on our own journeys, having experienced mountaintops, where things are going
[1653.80 → 1660.88] well, but also, Lord, walking through valleys when things are hard. But Lord, we thank you that you
[1660.88 → 1667.20] are with us, and that you give us your word to guide us, so that we know you and know your promises
[1667.20 → 1674.30] to us. And Lord, would you, by your Holy Spirit, illumine our hearts today and help us, Lord, to see
[1674.30 → 1684.46] Christ, to be nourished by his word, and to be his obedient and joyful followers. We pray in his holy
[1684.46 → 1692.62] name. Amen. So friends, Christianity is about joy. I hope that's not a surprising statement.
[1692.62 → 1701.00] In Philippians 4.4, the Apostle Paul says, Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again, rejoice.
[1701.72 → 1706.82] I will say it again, rejoice. I like how he does that. Rejoice in the Lord always. And he says,
[1707.16 → 1711.04] you know, you probably just missed it. I will say it again, rejoice. He's trying to emphasize,
[1711.70 → 1717.72] rejoice in the Lord, the joy of our salvation that we have. But the image of Christians that people often
[1717.72 → 1724.78] have is that Christians are kind of dour people. Christians can be kind of sombre people, or they're
[1724.78 → 1732.04] not much fun, or they can be kind of judgmental. That's what many people think of Christians as.
[1733.04 → 1740.58] And to be honest, maybe we get that fairly in some regards, right? There are Christians, so-called,
[1740.58 → 1749.98] who never crack a smile, who never laugh, or show any outward evidence of the inward joy that we have
[1749.98 → 1758.44] as Christians. Ellen Glasgow wrote about her father, who was a Presbyterian elder. She said,
[1758.88 → 1765.64] he was entirely unselfish. And in his long life, he never committed a pleasure.
[1765.64 → 1776.00] I never committed a pleasure. And it reminds me of another story with Martin Luther, his good friend,
[1776.18 → 1782.10] Philip Melanchthon. Melanchthon wrote the Oberg Confession. Melanchthon's personality was just very
[1782.10 → 1791.84] cool, very reserved. And Luther, as you may know, is known to be very hot and very kind of out there.
[1791.84 → 1797.72] And so on day, Luther lost patience with his friend Melanchthon, and he said, for heaven's sake, Philip,
[1797.94 → 1804.70] why don't you just go out and sin a little? God deserves to have something to forgive you for,
[1805.72 → 1811.10] right? Because he had this sense of like this virtuous reserve where it would be a so-called sin
[1811.10 → 1821.20] to even show pleasure in life. You know, but when I think about mature Christians, right? Christians
[1821.20 → 1827.96] I've known, people who just for years have been resting in the gospel and who have been abiding in
[1827.96 → 1835.66] Jesus, they're not like that at all. Oftentimes, they are humble, right? They are just exuded this
[1835.66 → 1843.90] kindness and graciousness. They are filled with joy. And that should be true of every Christian,
[1844.20 → 1849.46] every follower of Jesus. You know, and when we read the fruits of the Spirit in Galatians 5,
[1849.46 → 1855.48] the fruit of the Spirit begins with love. And then what's the second one? Joy. Love, joy, peace,
[1855.82 → 1863.04] patience, kindness. Okay? And so the Holy Spirit produces joy in us, and Christians grow in that
[1863.04 → 1869.60] over the course of a lifetime. We grow in joy. Now, before we go any farther, what do we mean by joy?
[1869.60 → 1881.72] What is joy? And I think when the Bible talks about joy, what it's talking about is a deep,
[1882.36 → 1893.00] settled pattern of life of being able to look at the world with trust, with hope, and with reliance
[1893.00 → 1900.80] upon God. Right? It's that joyfulness that comes from knowing that things in Him will turn out
[1900.80 → 1908.58] differently than maybe the circumstances in front of us might suggest. And, you know, of course, you know,
[1908.64 → 1915.38] we can have the emotion of joy, right, that comes from something fun or something that's exciting.
[1915.86 → 1920.50] Right? We experience all kinds of different joy in life, this emotion of joy. And so, you know,
[1920.50 → 1928.36] eating a Sunday, or what do you call it? An ice cream cone, there are Sundays too. Eating a Sunday
[1928.36 → 1937.34] on a hot sunny day. Eating an ice cream, right? Joy. Having a beautiful dinner and food with good
[1937.34 → 1943.90] friends or family, right? And we feel joyful in those times. And that's all fine, right? That's great even.
[1943.90 → 1952.56] Right? To have these momentary highs of joyfulness. But when the Bible, and certainly, you know, there is
[1952.56 → 1958.50] that, you know, Paul says rejoice. And there's a sense of actually, in the word, literally means to jump.
[1959.58 → 1966.04] So there's this exuberance and this emotion of joy. But oftentimes, when the Bible uses joy,
[1966.04 → 1975.78] it's talking about a settled joy. This state of the soul that remains kind of buoyed up regardless
[1975.78 → 1984.30] of the circumstances. And, you know, we think of that kid's song, right? I've got the joy, joy, joy,
[1984.46 → 1992.48] joy, where? Down in my heart. Right? It's this down in your heart to stay. It's that kind of joy.
[1992.48 → 1998.48] And so the question is, well, how do we get this kind of deep, settled joy? How do we get it? You
[1998.48 → 2003.68] know, because it's one thing to have joy, to experience joy in the mountaintops of life, but
[2003.68 → 2011.40] it's another thing to experience joy in the valley when things are hard. And for many of us, you know,
[2011.42 → 2016.90] that's, you know, with COVID and so many things going on in our world, that's the season that it
[2016.90 → 2025.86] kind of feels like we're in, this valley. So how do we have that deep, settled joy in our hearts
[2025.86 → 2032.90] that buoys us up despite the circumstances, the peaks or the valleys of this journey? That's the
[2032.90 → 2039.20] question for us today. And from our passage, I'd like to show us three things, consider three thoughts
[2039.20 → 2048.00] about joy. We're going to look at how joy, how do we get it? It's nurtured by remembrance of the past.
[2048.62 → 2054.24] Joy is nurtured by anticipation of the future. And then we're going to talk about how we can
[2054.24 → 2059.44] experience joy in the present. Okay? So past, future, present. So let's look at our first point
[2059.44 → 2066.60] for today. Joy is nurtured through remembrance. And so the psalm begins, and we're following the
[2066.60 → 2072.38] structure of the psalm. It's very clear. Verses one through three, the psalmist begins by reflecting,
[2072.84 → 2082.66] reflecting this way, on past joy, by remembering past joy. So let's, we'll have verses one and two here.
[2083.16 → 2090.32] This is what it says. When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed.
[2090.32 → 2098.46] Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Okay? So now, many commentators
[2098.46 → 2106.20] suggest that the original context for this psalm is the return from exile. And so in the Old Testament,
[2106.42 → 2114.28] one of the bleakest, one of the darkest periods in the history of God's people were when they were led
[2114.28 → 2122.28] away from the promised land and into exile. And they were led into exile because of their rebellion,
[2122.68 → 2129.98] of their turning away from God. And this is known as the Babylonian captivity. And it was a sign of
[2129.98 → 2138.92] judgment. But then, 70 years later, under the edict of King Cyrus, they were returned out of exile and
[2138.92 → 2144.24] brought back into their native land. And when they came back to Jerusalem, it was like coming home.
[2144.80 → 2148.20] Maybe some of you know what that's like. You've been away for a long time. You feel like you're in
[2148.20 → 2156.34] exile. And you come home and that's that feeling of joy that you have. And they were just overwhelmed
[2156.34 → 2162.82] by this sudden turn of fortunes. Right? And it says they were rejoicing. They were filled with laughter.
[2162.82 → 2169.88] I love how Anne Lamont says laughter is carbonated joy. Joy that's bubbling up out of us.
[2169.88 → 2177.16] They almost couldn't believe it. It was like they were dreaming. It was so good. And then in verse 2,
[2177.34 → 2184.40] going on, it said among the nations, it was said among the nations, the Lord has done great things
[2184.40 → 2190.54] for them. So this is other people talking about God's people, the Israelites. Right? Their deliverance
[2190.54 → 2198.40] from captivity was such an amazing thing that even the Gentiles were looking at this, and they recognized
[2198.40 → 2207.00] that it was accomplished by God. So one of the commentaries I've been reading for this series is
[2207.00 → 2212.34] by James Boyce on the Psalms. And this is what he says. I just wanted to share this quote with you
[2212.34 → 2221.38] because I thought it was so good. Their deliverance was entirely of God. For only God could bring about
[2221.38 → 2229.98] the sudden return of a formally exiled people. No nation carried into exile has ever returned
[2229.98 → 2237.12] to reconstitute itself as Israel did. This event was so evidently of God that even the Gentiles
[2237.12 → 2244.02] knew it. Right? I just think that's such a great historical insight that this doesn't just happen.
[2244.52 → 2251.50] Right? God did something that was beyond all expectations when he brought his people out of
[2251.50 → 2257.52] Babylon, this strong empire, by their blessing, working in the heart of the king to return his people.
[2257.52 → 2263.62] And it was so incredible that the nations are looking at it like this God that the Israelites
[2263.62 → 2270.58] worship, he is doing amazing things. And so the nations praise God. So what's happening here though
[2270.58 → 2278.22] is that the present joy that the Israelites experience, the people of God experience in this
[2278.22 → 2286.22] Psalm, what it is this drawing from, and it's building upon joy remembered. Okay? And so here's what we
[2286.22 → 2293.36] learn. We learn. We learn that one of the ways that we experience joy in the present is to remember the
[2293.36 → 2302.02] works of God. The things that God has done in the past. Right? And have you ever noticed this? That when
[2302.02 → 2311.12] you read the Bible, how often it exhorts the people of God to remember. Right? Remember that you were slaves
[2311.12 → 2318.78] in Egypt. Remember how I provided for you in the wilderness. And then, you know, it has this verse,
[2318.88 → 2326.32] on my bed, I remember you. I think of you through the watches of the night. And when we celebrate the
[2326.32 → 2335.96] Lord's Supper, what does Jesus tell us? Do this in remembrance of me. This remembrance of what I have
[2335.96 → 2343.92] accomplished, the works and acts of God. So, and when we do that, when we remember what God has done,
[2344.38 → 2351.36] we nurture joy. Okay? We Savoy the goodness of God when we think upon him, and we remember him.
[2351.60 → 2360.42] And that gives us joy as we remember those things now in the present. And so how do we do this in our
[2360.42 → 2368.36] lives? Two things. First, we have to read the Bible. Okay? We have to read the Bible. Because in the Bible,
[2368.36 → 2376.66] we read about God's works in the past. Because everything that happens in the scriptures is part
[2376.66 → 2383.96] of your story. It is part of your story as the people of God. You have been brought into this history,
[2383.96 → 2392.48] this family line and tree of what God has done for us. And so we read the Bible, and we remember these
[2392.48 → 2398.62] things. And secondly, we can remember the ways that God has acted faithfully in your life.
[2399.38 → 2407.02] In your own life, right? Do you remember moments when God just showed up in your life? Do you remember
[2407.02 → 2414.10] moments when God came through for you? Right? When God suddenly provided or he intervened?
[2415.66 → 2423.54] And when God acted to bring about something that you didn't expect? So often, we forget those things.
[2424.28 → 2430.44] And so we need to be people who are immersed in God's past acts of deliverance and the word and to
[2430.44 → 2435.88] think about what God has done in our own lives, in the life of our church. There's so much that we can
[2435.88 → 2441.96] point to, to see what God has done. So let me share with you, you know, I have a couple quotes I want
[2441.96 → 2447.32] to share also from Eugene Peterson. And I've mentioned this book. It's called A Long Obedience
[2447.32 → 2451.66] in the Same Direction. It's a commentary on the Psalms of Ascent. So this is what he says.
[2452.54 → 2461.92] We'll put it here. We are to fill our minds with the stories of God's acts. Joy has a history.
[2461.92 → 2470.96] Joy is the verified, repeated experience of those involved in what God is doing. It is as real as a
[2470.96 → 2476.98] day in history. Joy is nurtured by living in such a history, building on such a foundation.
[2478.92 → 2480.58] What a great quote that is.
[2483.26 → 2489.30] So Peterson is saying, in order to have present joy, look back on joy remembered. Right? And so that's
[2489.30 → 2495.38] what the first thing that we see this psalmist doing here. But there's another movement in this
[2495.38 → 2503.78] psalm, and that's our second point, that we find in verses four to six. God's people don't just remember
[2503.78 → 2510.50] the past, but they also anticipate what God will do in the future. Right? They have a future hope that
[2510.50 → 2517.72] joy will come. It's not just left in the past, but joy, but it will come. God will continue to work.
[2517.72 → 2526.14] And then those psalmists use these two very striking metaphors here. And he likens future joy
[2526.14 → 2538.16] to a drought and to sowing in tears. Okay? And so we feel this tension in this psalm. It's about joy,
[2538.30 → 2544.24] but the whole context of the psalm is joy in the valley. It's joy when life is hard. And how do we do
[2544.24 → 2549.84] that? And this is what he gets into. So first, the first metaphor is in verse four. And we'll put it up
[2549.84 → 2559.10] here on the screen. He says, restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev. So what's the Negev?
[2559.14 → 2566.36] The Negev was a vast desert. It was to the south of Israel. And for most of the year, it's just
[2566.36 → 2576.26] incredibly dry. It's just baking in the hot, dry sun. And the land, it gets all cracked and hard and
[2576.26 → 2586.12] parched. And then there are these stream beds, but they're dried up all the time. And so you look at
[2586.12 → 2592.40] it, and it looks like nothing is alive. Except every once in a while, a storm, a rain kind of blows through.
[2592.40 → 2600.22] And the water quickly fills up these dry stream beds. And all the hidden life under that hardened
[2600.22 → 2606.90] dirt, all of those little seeds, they instantly spring up. And so a day or two after a big rain,
[2606.96 → 2611.94] you go out there into the desert, and it's alive. There's all of these grasses and all these flowers
[2611.94 → 2618.74] blooming, and it's beautiful. And it's this happens suddenly. And so what they're saying is sometimes
[2618.74 → 2627.08] joy is like that. There can be a season of hard, hot barrenness, and then suddenly this drought is
[2627.08 → 2633.56] interrupted by an outpouring of God's grace where everything suddenly is blooming. Right? Sometimes
[2633.56 → 2639.86] joy comes into our life like that. But there's a second metaphor that the psalmist uses as well.
[2639.86 → 2652.90] Second, he gives us an agricultural metaphor. It says, those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.
[2653.24 → 2661.24] Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
[2661.48 → 2667.08] Right? Carrying the harvest. And so while the first metaphor is about a sudden interruption of joy,
[2667.08 → 2676.04] the second metaphor is not sudden at all, but rather it is slow. Okay? It's the image of farming.
[2676.22 → 2682.38] And I know many of you here are farmers, and so you can relate to this. Where a farmer goes out day after day
[2682.38 → 2690.82] sowing seed, cultivating the land, not seeing a harvest yet, but continuing to sow, continuing to cultivate
[2690.82 → 2702.32] because one day patiently the harvest will come. And so sometimes, and usually more often,
[2703.24 → 2711.64] joy is like that. Right? Where you take your tears and sow them into the ground. And the Bible is talking
[2711.64 → 2719.08] about you plant the seeds into the dryness of this desert. The dryness of just heartache and grief
[2719.08 → 2725.78] and loss and the shame that we have, and we plant them in God. And when the time comes, that they're
[2725.78 → 2732.32] going to grow up, and you'll have a harvest of joy and delight. Because everything that you've given to
[2732.32 → 2739.68] God, you've planted these tears, God will restore. God will bring a harvest out of them. So listen to what
[2739.68 → 2749.28] Peter said, Peter said, says about this. He wrote this, if the joy producing acts of God are characteristic
[2749.28 → 2756.76] of our past as God's people, they will also be characteristic of our future as God's people.
[2757.96 → 2764.00] There is no reason to suppose that God will arbitrarily change his way of working with us.
[2764.00 → 2772.02] What we have known of him, we will know of him. Just as joy builds on the past, it borrows from the future.
[2772.54 → 2781.18] It expects certain things to happen. Right? So in terms of anticipating joy, here's the point.
[2782.22 → 2789.88] That no matter how deep the valley is that we are in, the promise of every single Christian
[2789.88 → 2793.54] is that joy will always have the last word in your life.
[2795.62 → 2802.20] Joy is, sorrow, sorry, is always temporary. Of course, it doesn't always feel like that.
[2802.36 → 2810.82] But what the Bible promises is that sorrow is temporary. And it will always give way to permanent joy.
[2811.86 → 2817.44] Right? Sometimes it could be a sudden flood. More often, it is like a slow harvest, but it will come.
[2817.44 → 2824.70] And sometimes we do get these tastes of joy on this side now of the new creation. Right?
[2824.78 → 2831.96] Sometimes we will see God doing amazing things in our lives, in amazing things in our church, or in our world.
[2833.70 → 2841.22] You know, we see him restoring what is lost to us, even now. We see him healing what is sick,
[2841.30 → 2845.74] and mending what is broken. And sometimes we will experience that joy in this life.
[2845.74 → 2853.12] But so much of our ultimate joy will come, not now, but in the new creation, when Jesus himself
[2853.12 → 2859.84] restores our world and restores everything to the fullness of joy. Right? So everything that we have
[2859.84 → 2868.44] lost in this life will be regained. Everything that, it talks about these tears, all tears will be dried.
[2869.06 → 2873.24] Some of them will now, but in the future, all of them will be. All burdens will be lifted.
[2873.24 → 2877.32] All brokenness will be mended. And eventually, all death will be wiped away.
[2878.78 → 2885.38] And so what that means, friends, is that when you follow Jesus, what it tells us is that your best days
[2885.38 → 2893.46] are ahead of you. Right? The very best season of your life is not behind you. It is ahead of you
[2893.46 → 2896.78] because joy will have the final word.
[2896.78 → 2905.58] So how do we cultivate joy? According to the psalm, we look back and remember what God has done.
[2906.08 → 2914.02] We look forward, and we anticipate what God will do. And so we get an equation, don't we?
[2914.02 → 2923.74] Here's the equation for joy that this psalm gives us. Memory plus hope is joy. Right?
[2924.14 → 2927.90] This is how we get joy now. We remember the past, we have hope in the future,
[2928.52 → 2932.84] because God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that gives us joy.
[2932.84 → 2942.04] Okay. So now, here's our third point. Experiencing joy in the present. And there are a few things,
[2942.10 → 2947.20] just two main things I want to point out in terms of how we can experience joy now in the present.
[2947.68 → 2953.44] And the first thing we see is this, that God's faithfulness extends past, present, and future.
[2953.44 → 2962.46] And this helps us because sometimes we can have this myopic vision, and our focus can rob us of joy.
[2962.78 → 2970.30] So here's what I mean. For some of us, we focus on the past, and we make the past an idol.
[2970.92 → 2976.60] So for instance, you know, we get so caught up in the past in terms of nostalgia that we say,
[2976.60 → 2984.12] oh, remember the good old days, right? Remember this golden age we have in our mind of where,
[2984.52 → 2992.32] you know, the world as it should be. So much so that you can't rejoice in what God is doing
[2992.32 → 2999.02] now in the present. Because you're focusing on the past, when it was good, when God was doing amazing
[2999.02 → 3004.52] things, and you're so focused there that when God is still at work, it's different, but it's still at
[3004.52 → 3009.86] work, and you can't rejoice in it because you're focused on the past, right? We do that in all
[3009.86 → 3015.52] sorts of ways. You know, we think about maybe, gosh, when I was young. I mean, I even do that now.
[3015.98 → 3023.28] When I was young, the good days. Or we think about maybe the heyday of the church. Or that time,
[3023.70 → 3032.34] you know, in our political or our social life. The golden age. But if we locate our joy in the past,
[3032.34 → 3038.76] that's where it will stay. And it makes it hard to be joyful in the present. Now, for some of us,
[3038.76 → 3044.88] we don't focus on the past. We focus on the future. But we focus on the future in such a way that it
[3044.88 → 3050.58] brings anxiety and the uncertainty of what will happen. And so, you can't experience joy in the
[3050.58 → 3056.50] present because you're anxious about the future. You can't even see what God is doing now because
[3056.50 → 3062.44] you're so worried about what might happen in the future. So, and Jesus talks about this in Matthew 6,
[3062.76 → 3067.76] where he says, don't be anxious about, you know, what you're going to wear, what you're going to eat.
[3068.12 → 3076.36] Do not be anxious about tomorrow. God cares for you. And for some of us, also, we don't think about
[3076.36 → 3082.36] the past. We don't think about the future. What are we thinking about? The present. Because we're so,
[3082.36 → 3088.92] we're so focused on the present. Because when life is difficult, it is so easy to only stay focused on
[3088.92 → 3094.44] the present. Because life is hard, there are challenges, and that's it. It's that this is the
[3094.44 → 3099.98] end all be all. I don't remember God's faithfulness in the past. I have no hope for the future because
[3099.98 → 3108.92] I'm so caught up in the present. And so, Psalm 126, what it does for us is it expands our vision of God
[3108.92 → 3116.82] so that we can experience joy? Because it's telling us that God cares for you, that God governs all
[3116.82 → 3124.96] things, that he is always faithful, that he loves you, and his promises are true in every season of
[3124.96 → 3131.32] your life. In the past, the present, and the future. God is the God of the past. He is the God of the
[3131.32 → 3138.34] present, and he is the God of the future. So God's got you covered, right? And when we believe deep down
[3138.34 → 3146.36] in our hearts, that is true, that God has got you covered, that enables us to become people marked
[3146.36 → 3156.80] by joy. Here's the second thing that I want us to note about experiencing joy. That you are not at
[3156.80 → 3167.48] the centre of the story, but God is. You are not the centre of the story, but God is. In verse 1,
[3167.48 → 3175.76] remember, it says, when the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion. When the Lord restored the fortunes of
[3175.76 → 3183.90] Zion. And we have to be careful when we see this image, restore the fortunes, not to inject a modern
[3183.90 → 3190.10] understanding thinking that the psalmist is talking about some sort of material prosperity. Restore our
[3190.10 → 3193.40] fortunes, right? And that means everything is going to be easy, everything is going to be comfortable,
[3193.40 → 3199.38] and all of this. Like, you know, the stock market is down, but it rebounded. God restored our fortunes.
[3200.02 → 3205.88] Or, you know, we were sick, but we want healing. God's going to restore our fortunes. That's not the
[3205.88 → 3213.98] understanding here. Rather, the literal translation here is that the Lord will turn our turnings.
[3213.98 → 3219.92] That's the literal translation. And it's used throughout the prophets, and it always refers
[3219.92 → 3230.02] to God turning from judgment to favour. From turning to judging his people to turning and having favour
[3230.02 → 3236.16] on them and restoring them to himself. And so the language here is the language of salvation.
[3236.52 → 3243.12] It's the language of redemption. It's the language of God doing this. And so when we think about the
[3243.12 → 3250.46] great works of God, of redemption, it has a past, and it has a future. We look back at the past, and when
[3250.46 → 3258.22] we consider Jesus coming into this world, it's like a dream. It's so incredible. It's amazing.
[3258.58 → 3266.26] It's almost too good to be true. That God sends his son out of his love for us to address our sin
[3266.26 → 3274.52] and to give us eternal life. That in Jesus, God loves you, and God forgives you, and he has saved you,
[3274.60 → 3283.30] and he upholds you. And this is so stunning that it should lead us to rejoice, right? To have this joy
[3283.30 → 3289.52] of our salvation. And so much so that the people around us, just like the nations here, see it,
[3289.52 → 3297.00] and they give thanks to God. And then when we look at the future, what do we see? Jesus's promised
[3297.00 → 3303.64] return. So in Revelation, the last book of the Bible, when it speaks of Jesus's return, there's this
[3303.64 → 3310.44] language in chapter 22 when it talks about the future. And there's this river that flows from the
[3310.44 → 3316.78] throne of God, and it goes out to the nations. And then when we compare that to Psalm 126, where this
[3316.78 → 3321.54] is the streams of water that will flow over parched land where everything is going to bloom.
[3321.88 → 3329.46] That is a picture of our future that God promises. And in Revelation 19, it talks about the marriage
[3329.46 → 3335.52] supper of the Lamb. Thinking back at our passage, right? There's this harvest of abundance, where all
[3335.52 → 3341.76] this harvest is going to be brought in, and the people of God just carrying this bounty are going to be,
[3341.76 → 3347.88] they sowed in tears, but they're going to reap with joy, carrying their sheaves with them. And we look
[3347.88 → 3354.88] in the future, and what do we see? The marriage supper of the Lamb, with this bounty and abundance of joy,
[3355.54 → 3362.16] where every people from every tongue, tribe, and nation gathered around the throne, and there's a place
[3362.16 → 3373.86] for you at the table. So to wrap things up, you know, it's one thing to experience joy when we're in the
[3373.86 → 3378.48] mountaintops, in the peaks, when everything is beautiful, and everything's going great. It's another
[3378.48 → 3385.16] thing to experience joy in the valleys, when things are hard, when things are difficult. So how do we
[3385.16 → 3394.14] experience joy? The psalm tells us that we are to remember God's acts in the past, ultimately in the
[3394.14 → 3400.04] cross of Jesus Christ, and we are to look ahead and anticipate the hope and the joy that God will do in
[3400.04 → 3408.40] the future. And right now, we are on a journey. The journey is often hard, it's long, it's difficult,
[3408.40 → 3415.80] it's arduous, but ultimately it's a journey of joy. Why is it a journey of joy? It's because we follow
[3415.80 → 3428.00] Jesus, the joy giver. He gives joy to his people. And so may the Holy Spirit mark us with joy. Would we
[3428.00 → 3437.70] be people of joy? Okay, would you pray with me? Father, we thank you for the work that you do in your
[3437.70 → 3444.12] Holy Spirit. That we can have this hope that despite everything that's happening in our lives,
[3444.20 → 3450.14] all the difficulties that we have faced and will continue to face. Lord, that by your Holy Spirit,
[3450.36 → 3460.96] you are able to give us this deep stability of soul, this deep joy that buoys us despite whatever
[3460.96 → 3468.90] circumstances come across. And Lord, so that like your saints throughout all times and places,
[3468.90 → 3476.40] people who truly know and follow you, that when people would see us, that we're even having experienced
[3476.40 → 3484.56] so much hardship, that we would still be people who shine with joy because we know you and because
[3484.56 → 3491.34] you are at work in our lives. And Lord, would that joy help us in the peaks and in the valleys?
[3492.18 → 3497.10] We pray for your help by your Holy Spirit. In Jesus' name, amen.
[3497.10 → 3497.22] Amen.
[3506.50 → 3507.74] Please stand with us.
[3507.74 → 3508.52] Amen.
[3508.52 → 3510.52] Amen.
[3538.52 → 3543.88] We will sing with our hearts restored.

[3549.98 → 3555.48] We will feast and weep no more.
[3558.24 → 3563.64] We will not be burned by the fire.
[3563.64 → 3569.16] He is the Lord, our God.
[3569.46 → 3575.06] We are now consumed by the fire.
[3575.88 → 3581.88] A well protected, gathered.
[3583.18 → 3588.22] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[3588.22 → 3593.60] We will sing with our hearts restored.

[3599.72 → 3605.06] We will feast and weep no more.
[3607.52 → 3613.46] In the dark of night before the dawn.
[3613.46 → 3622.92] My soul be not afraid for the promised morning.
[3622.92 → 3624.68] Oh, how long.
[3625.78 → 3631.50] Oh, God of Jacob, be my strength.
[3631.50 → 3642.96] We will feast and weep no more.
[3642.96 → 3654.96] He will feast and weep no more.
[3654.96 → 3663.10] Every time you've broken and betrayed.
[3663.10 → 3669.20] You are the faithful one.
[3669.20 → 3674.20] And from the garden to the grave.
[3674.20 → 3676.20] Find us together.
[3676.20 → 3678.20] Find us together.
[3678.20 → 3681.20] We will feast and weep no more.
