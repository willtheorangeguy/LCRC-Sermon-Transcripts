[294.86 → 299.86] Good morning and welcome to Latin and Christ Reformed Church.
[299.86 → 313.86] Whether you're watching live now on YouTube or later, we want you to be blessed by the presence of our Lord among us, even though we're physically separated at this time of COVID.
[313.86 → 320.86] This morning we have a special service of baptism with Lyra Gabrielle and Maggie Behan.
[320.86 → 324.86] Pastor Jason will open the scriptures for us.
[324.86 → 330.86] The collection today is for the support of new immigrants.
[330.86 → 335.86] You can make a donation online or drop it off at the church anytime.
[335.86 → 345.86] We heard this morning that John Ram was transferred to Sarah Memorial Hospital for some further tests, but the doctors are very optimistic.
[345.86 → 351.86] I am Bart. I haven't been up here for many years, so bear with me.
[351.86 → 361.86] Our call to worship this morning comes from the words of our Lord Jesus himself, taken from Matthew 11.
[361.86 → 362.86] And he comes from the church as well.
[362.86 → 363.86] And he says,
[363.86 → 368.86] Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[368.86 → 381.86] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[381.86 → 386.86] As we enter his presence, the Lord greets us with these words.
[386.86 → 403.86] Grace and peace to you from him who is and was and is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.
[403.86 → 416.86] Grace and peace to you from him, and the Lord be with you, and the Lord be with you.
[416.86 → 422.86] And to all of you who are by themselves, I say, the Lord be with you.
[422.86 → 437.86] All of you who are by ourselves, etc Lord is with you.
[437.86 → 442.86] What do you always say?
[442.86 → 445.86] Control the claim of Jesus Christ.
[445.86 → 449.86] unveil throttle
[449.86 → 479.20] Come now and worship the Lord.
[479.86 → 494.26] Come all your people, come praise the Spirit.
[494.26 → 500.26] Come now and worship the Lord.
[509.86 → 526.74] From the ends of the earth, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens, your name be praised.
[526.74 → 544.74] From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we read is all.
[544.74 → 556.74] Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[556.74 → 567.88] Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[568.26 → 574.74] Be magnified, be magnified.
[574.74 → 592.74] From the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens, your name be praised.
[592.74 → 610.74] From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we read is all.
[610.74 → 622.74] Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[622.74 → 634.74] Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[634.74 → 642.74] Be magnified, be magnified.
[652.74 → 663.74] My name is Maggie, and I was born in China, Beijing in the year 2006.
[663.74 → 665.74] This year, I will turn 15 years old.
[665.74 → 669.74] My mom and I moved to Canada when I was just about 4 years old.
[669.74 → 675.74] There was never a time in my life where I did not identify as a Christian, as I grew up in a Christian home and environment.
[675.74 → 678.74] I was always taught to pray and not sin.
[678.74 → 682.74] When I was in kindergarten, my mom started taking me to church.
[682.74 → 686.74] But at that point in my life, I couldn't quite understand what was going on.
[686.74 → 689.74] I didn't really know the idea of Christianity.
[689.74 → 693.74] All I really knew was to not sin and when people die, they go to heaven.
[693.74 → 696.74] I never had an idea of whom this Jesus person was.
[696.74 → 705.74] But as I slowly grew up, and I could understand better what Christianity was, I had many doubts of does God even exist?
[705.74 → 709.74] I felt like a fake Christian at the time because I had these unclean thoughts.
[709.74 → 715.74] But then I grew up a little bit more, and I started reading the Bible more and communicating with my friends and family more.
[715.74 → 720.74] This helped me better understand God's word and my doubts started to slowly fade away.
[720.74 → 727.74] I don't have an exact date or moment to say I really accepted Christ in my life for myself and not for my family or others.
[727.74 → 731.74] But it was probably going to be around my middle school years.
[731.74 → 737.74] My favourite verse in the Bible is 1 Peter 5-7.
[737.74 → 741.74] Cast all your anxieties on him because he cares for you.
[741.74 → 747.74] The reason this is my favourite verse is that in this verse, Peter gives this idea to humble ourselves and resist the devil.
[747.74 → 751.74] While putting out all our anxieties, negative feelings, and stress on God.
[751.74 → 763.74] For me personally, I cast out my anxieties by praying to God each night and just telling him the things that may be feeling stressed, anxious, or even just telling him the things that may be making me feel unhappy.
[763.74 → 769.74] As a community, I pray that we can grow together in faith and move forward as a community.
[769.74 → 783.74] Hi, I'm Lauren Gabrielle, and I'm 13 years old. Last year I graduated from Delta Christian School.
[787.74 → 793.74] This year I'm in grade 8 in Delta Secondary School, but I'm learning online.
[793.74 → 798.74] Next year I will be in grade 9 in South Delta Secondary School in Wasson.
[798.74 → 812.74] I was born in Egypt and moved to Cyprus with my parents and my brother when I was 9 months old and studied Cypriot schools until grade 3.
[812.74 → 834.86] My father is Armenian Egyptian and my mother is Egyptian.
[834.86 → 841.42] So I'm Egyptian, Armenian, Canadian with a superior background.
[841.42 → 848.30] I was raised in a Christian family, and we were attending a home church in Cyprus and all
[848.30 → 857.76] was speaking about miracles happening in our life and how God is with us always and loves
[857.76 → 859.04] us.
[859.04 → 865.04] So speaking about God and Jesus was always a part of my life.
[865.04 → 871.68] Then we came to Canada and I attended Delta Christian school, Sunday schools and summer
[871.68 → 873.76] camps with CRC Church.
[873.76 → 881.36] I read two versions of the Children's Bible, and we always pray before food and at night.
[881.36 → 888.56] My faith is Father God loves me and the whole world and what Jesus has died on the cross
[888.56 → 889.56] for us.
[889.56 → 897.38] Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour and I wanted to be part of the church and all its activities
[897.38 → 901.74] and also to receive the internal life.
[901.74 → 908.94] When I heard about the baptism classes with Pastor Jason, I was eager to attend the classes
[908.94 → 914.08] so I can get baptized and start my journey.
[914.08 → 922.80] My preferred verse is about happiness as I always like to be happy, so the verse is from Philippians
[922.80 → 927.02] 4 which says, Rejoice in the Lord always.
[927.02 → 929.08] I will say it again, Rejoice.
[929.08 → 929.58] Amen.
[944.08 → 945.08] Okay.
[945.08 → 953.16] So everyone, you've just gotten to hear from Maggie and Laura.
[953.16 → 959.14] And they did, I think you will agree, a wonderful job making their videos and I think they were
[959.14 → 962.72] a little bit nervous, but they did a really great job.
[962.72 → 967.86] And I have gotten to know Maggie and Laura doing the baptism class.
[967.86 → 972.10] And they are very smart young women.
[972.10 → 978.00] They ask great questions and I had a perfect time studying and learning about God with
[978.00 → 979.80] them.
[979.80 → 985.46] And so I'm excited for now and that this is the day when you can be baptized.
[985.46 → 988.72] So this is very exciting.
[988.72 → 994.54] Now I'm going to say some words and give an introduction about baptism.
[994.54 → 1001.04] So these words from Jesus are familiar to us, and they are an invitation and a promise
[1001.04 → 1003.52] to all of us.
[1003.52 → 1009.30] All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, Jesus says.
[1009.30 → 1016.12] Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[1016.12 → 1019.06] of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1019.06 → 1025.30] And teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you, and surely I am with you always
[1025.30 → 1029.12] to the end of the age.
[1029.12 → 1035.40] So in obedience to this command that Jesus gave right before he left earths, the church
[1035.40 → 1038.06] baptizes believers.
[1038.06 → 1044.62] And so our gracious God has always desired to hold on to his people through this covenant
[1044.62 → 1046.38] of baptism.
[1046.38 → 1052.62] The Lord declares over and over in the scriptures that I will be your God and you will be my
[1052.62 → 1054.20] people.
[1054.20 → 1061.14] And so in baptism, God claims us as his own, as his sons and his daughters.
[1061.14 → 1064.48] He marks us to be his own people.
[1064.48 → 1073.32] And he seals us with the Holy Spirit as a sign of our membership into the body of Christ.
[1073.32 → 1077.00] So we put water on us, and it's a sign of cleansing.
[1077.00 → 1085.32] It's a sign throughout the Bible of the cleansing and being set apart for God, holy to him.
[1085.70 → 1086.76] And that's what we see in the Bible.
[1088.38 → 1098.68] And so also in baptism, it is a call to us to then give ourselves to God, to love him,
[1098.68 → 1101.98] to trust him, to follow Jesus our whole lives.
[1103.24 → 1112.82] And so Maggie and Laura, you are coming today to publicly confess your faith before us here
[1112.82 → 1114.44] and all those watching at home.
[1115.08 → 1118.84] And also to receive the sacrament of baptism that Jesus gave us.
[1119.14 → 1124.70] And so I'm going to ask you a couple questions as a way to take vows and publicly profess your
[1124.70 → 1125.70] faith.
[1125.70 → 1132.44] So the first question, do you renounce sin and the power of evil in your life and in the
[1132.44 → 1132.84] world?
[1135.10 → 1135.62] Great.
[1136.66 → 1136.82] Oh.
[1138.10 → 1138.96] Well, okay.
[1140.30 → 1142.70] Who is your Lord and Saviour?
[1145.70 → 1152.10] And will you be a faithful member of this congregation and through worship and service seek to advance
[1152.10 → 1153.94] God's kingdom here and throughout the world?
[1155.38 → 1155.74] Okay.
[1155.94 → 1156.20] Great.
[1156.56 → 1160.54] I know you all can't hear very well, but they've answered the questions perfectly.
[1161.54 → 1166.52] So let me pray for God's spirit to be with us.
[1166.78 → 1167.16] Let's pray.
[1168.30 → 1175.44] Father, we thank you for this glorious day, a day of new life, a new beginning for Maggie
[1175.44 → 1176.22] and for Laura.
[1177.02 → 1180.74] Lord, would you in this time be present with us?
[1180.74 → 1187.72] Would you put upon their hearts a sense of your love for them, your care for them, and
[1187.72 → 1189.68] your claim upon their lives?
[1190.32 → 1191.96] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[1192.60 → 1192.96] Amen.
[1194.96 → 1197.70] So, Maggie, I guess you can go first.
[1201.96 → 1203.10] So just kneel here.
[1203.10 → 1203.16] Thank you.
[1203.16 → 1203.22] Thank you.
[1210.74 → 1220.02] So, Maggie, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1220.84 → 1221.14] Amen.
[1221.14 → 1221.28] Amen.
[1225.28 → 1226.30] You may stand up.
[1226.40 → 1226.76] Yeah, here.
[1227.86 → 1228.34] There you go.
[1231.54 → 1232.20] And Laura.
[1232.20 → 1232.28] Laura.
[1232.28 → 1233.24] Laura.
[1237.80 → 1238.24] Laura.
[1238.42 → 1245.82] I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1246.76 → 1247.06] Amen.
[1247.06 → 1247.18] Amen.
[1251.68 → 1252.58] You may stand.
[1254.76 → 1255.68] And there you are.
[1255.68 → 1264.50] So, again, I will make this pronouncement that in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1264.66 → 1271.18] who is the King and the head of the church, Maggie and Laura, you are now received into
[1271.18 → 1272.52] the membership of Christ's church.
[1273.22 → 1277.04] You have been sealed by the Holy Spirit, and you belong to Christ forever.
[1277.72 → 1278.00] Amen.
[1278.32 → 1279.50] So let me pray again for us.
[1279.50 → 1287.86] Father, we thank you for this sacrament of baptism as we can sense and feel the water
[1287.86 → 1288.82] upon us.
[1289.22 → 1294.00] Lord, we know that it's a reminder to us that you have sealed us with your Holy Spirit,
[1294.46 → 1299.78] that you have washed away our sins, that you have claimed us to belong to you.
[1300.56 → 1304.40] Lord, I pray for Maggie and Laura that throughout their whole lives, that they would be able to
[1304.40 → 1309.98] look back on this day, and no matter what they face going forward, that they would remember
[1309.98 → 1314.00] that they are precious children of God and that they belong to you.
[1314.80 → 1320.74] We pray for Christ's image to be formed in them through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1321.36 → 1322.74] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1323.48 → 1323.82] Amen.
[1326.58 → 1327.82] Okay, I'll take those.
[1329.30 → 1330.50] And hold tight.
[1334.40 → 1340.82] There you are.
[1341.00 → 1346.10] This is a NIV study Bible, so you can continue to learn about Jesus.
[1346.48 → 1346.86] There you go.
[1347.80 → 1348.44] All right, thanks.
[1348.44 → 1348.54] Thank you.
[1364.40 → 1379.60] Beautiful Saviour, King of creation,
[1379.60 → 1393.80] Beautiful Saviour, King of creation,
[1394.80 → 1404.04] Son of God and Son of man,
[1404.04 → 1409.64] Truly I love Thee,
[1409.64 → 1414.80] Truly I serve Thee,
[1414.80 → 1419.32] Light of my soul,
[1419.32 → 1424.64] My joy, my crown.
[1424.64 → 1430.82] There are the meadows,
[1430.82 → 1436.68] There are the God of God's sights,
[1436.68 → 1440.80] Hope, and fasted,
[1441.60 → 1442.86] Thee,
[1442.86 → 1444.92] Which in springs.
[1447.02 → 1451.42] Jesus is fair and night,
[1451.42 → 1456.14] Jesus is pure,
[1456.14 → 1466.14] He makes us all experience sing.
[1466.14 → 1488.00] Beautiful city, Lord, God of the nations, Son of God and Son of Man.
[1488.00 → 1510.30] Glory and honour, praise and honour, and forevermore be Thine.
[1518.00 → 1541.00] We come now to a time of confession.
[1541.00 → 1546.00] Please pray with me the words that are on the screen.
[1546.00 → 1553.00] Eternal God, we confess that often we have failed to be obedient children.
[1553.00 → 1556.00] We have not done your will.
[1556.00 → 1559.00] We have broken your law.
[1559.00 → 1562.00] We have rebelled against your love.
[1562.00 → 1566.00] We have not loved our neighbour as ourselves.
[1566.00 → 1570.00] We have ignored the cry of the needy.
[1570.00 → 1573.00] Forgive us, we pray.
[1573.00 → 1580.00] Set us free so that we can follow you obediently through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1580.00 → 1581.00] Amen.
[1581.00 → 1594.00] Now to all who share this confession, hear these words from our Lord and be at peace.
[1594.00 → 1601.00] Our Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in love.
[1601.00 → 1607.00] He will not always accuse, nor will he harbour his anger forever.
[1607.00 → 1612.00] He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1612.00 → 1620.00] For as high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1620.00 → 1626.00] As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1626.00 → 1635.00] As the Father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1635.00 → 1637.00] Amen.
[1637.00 → 1638.00] Amen.
[1638.00 → 1639.00] Amen.
[1639.00 → 1640.00] Amen.
[1640.00 → 1641.00] Amen.
[1641.00 → 1642.00] Amen.
[1642.00 → 1643.00] Amen.
[1643.00 → 1644.00] Amen.
[1644.00 → 1645.00] Amen.
[1645.00 → 1649.00] Amen.
[1649.00 → 1662.00] I lift my eyes up to the mountains, where does my help come from?
[1662.00 → 1665.00] My help comes from you, we hear us from you.
[1665.00 → 1674.22] We are of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1676.36 → 1680.02] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[1680.18 → 1683.00] You are my only hope.
[1684.06 → 1687.82] You are my only prayer.
[1687.82 → 1697.94] Oh, I'm a way for you to love and bless you me.
[1698.42 → 1702.10] Come and lead me, Lord.
[1704.84 → 1712.10] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1712.10 → 1717.10] Where does my help come from?
[1718.72 → 1731.06] My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1733.20 → 1737.58] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[1737.98 → 1741.78] You are my only hope.
[1742.26 → 1745.72] You are my only prayer.
[1747.82 → 1756.76] So I will wait for you to come and bless you me.
[1757.18 → 1761.06] Come and give me life.
[1761.06 → 1771.42] I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1771.42 → 1776.06] Where does my help come from?
[1776.06 → 1797.12] Good morning again, everyone.
[1797.12 → 1801.38] I hope you are very well wherever you are at home.
[1802.76 → 1807.36] And so we are in the church season of Epiphany.
[1807.74 → 1809.12] Sorry, of Easter.
[1810.32 → 1812.06] We're in the church season of Easter.
[1812.80 → 1814.82] And see, I'm trying to get you to pay attention.
[1814.82 → 1827.86] And so Easter is not just one Sunday, the day we celebrate Christ's resurrection, but it's actually a season of 50 days, leading from Easter Sunday all the way up to Pentecost.
[1827.86 → 1831.58] It's the celebration that Jesus is alive.
[1831.58 → 1836.96] Because Jesus, when he rose, he spent time with his disciples, teaching them.
[1837.96 → 1842.44] And so the church has always celebrated Easter as a season of 50 days.
[1842.44 → 1850.68] And today we are going to begin a new series for the next six weeks, six Sundays of Easter.
[1851.22 → 1854.14] And it's a series entitled You Are.
[1855.04 → 1864.54] So if you remember back in Epiphany, we did a series called I Am, looking at the seven I Am sayings of Jesus from the Gospel of John.
[1864.54 → 1870.24] And so this series called You Are kind of goes along with that.
[1870.72 → 1882.12] Because we want to know who Jesus is, but we also want to learn who we are when we are united to the risen Christ by faith.
[1882.20 → 1887.56] Who does that make us as men and women who are united to Christ?
[1887.56 → 1894.42] So what we're going to do is we're going to look at some of the titles that are given to Christians in the New Testament.
[1895.42 → 1897.72] Because titles do something really profound.
[1898.00 → 1904.14] Titles are given as a way of defining who and what we are.
[1905.04 → 1915.74] And I think the various titles that are ascribed to us are meant to explain us to ourselves and to the world around us.
[1915.74 → 1916.84] So here are some examples.
[1917.56 → 1919.50] The titles, not yet.
[1919.78 → 1920.78] Not yet on that one.
[1921.58 → 1924.14] So for example, mother and father.
[1925.12 → 1928.84] So if you have the title of mother and father, that means you have children.
[1929.52 → 1935.56] If you have the title of brother or sister, that means you have siblings.
[1936.68 → 1940.84] And then also, as we look at the workforce, we have various titles.
[1940.84 → 1946.92] So we have teacher, nurse, builder, farmer, artist.
[1947.00 → 1951.74] All of these are titles that tell us who we are and what our place is in the world.
[1952.60 → 1957.46] And all of these different titles do that for us.
[1957.46 → 1963.16] One place that we really see our love for titles, I think, is Instagram.
[1964.12 → 1966.52] So that's where you'll have a name.
[1967.38 → 1971.28] And then under that name, sometimes people will put all of these titles,
[1971.68 → 1976.16] these titles that they claim for themselves.
[1976.16 → 1979.08] So I do want to show you this one example here.
[1979.50 → 1980.98] This is Kelly Clark.
[1981.34 → 1984.46] She is a professional snowboarder from Vermont, where I'm from.
[1984.88 → 1986.72] And I really admire her.
[1987.54 → 1990.38] And as you can see, she's won some Olympic medals.
[1990.38 → 1995.90] So her Instagram profile says, you know, it's Kelly Clark and underneath,
[1996.34 → 2002.80] snowboarder, lover of God, author, she's written a book, Olympian.
[2003.30 → 2006.84] And then I love this one at the end, dog mom.
[2008.28 → 2009.96] Okay, and so these are all these titles.
[2010.66 → 2018.52] And so I think titles are important because they can help us to identify what it is that we are to be.
[2018.52 → 2024.22] When we put our faith in Christ, we take on the title of Christian.
[2024.92 → 2032.70] But if we look to the New Testament, there are other titles that are given to really define for us
[2032.70 → 2035.76] what it means to be a Christian.
[2036.14 → 2042.14] All of these other titles help us to kind of flesh out really who we are in Christ.
[2042.58 → 2045.14] And so that's what we're going to be exploring in this series.
[2045.14 → 2050.02] Some of the titles that define for us who we are in Christ.
[2050.86 → 2057.08] And the first title of this series I want us to consider today is the title of Disciple.
[2057.80 → 2058.50] Okay, Disciple.
[2058.78 → 2061.24] Disciple is a really important one.
[2061.92 → 2064.50] So we will read our passage for today.
[2064.66 → 2069.98] It is going to be in Mark 8, verses 34 to 38.
[2069.98 → 2078.30] Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said,
[2079.10 → 2085.54] Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
[2086.16 → 2089.50] For whoever wants to save their lives will lose it.
[2090.08 → 2095.04] But whoever loses their lives for me and for the gospel will save it.
[2095.04 → 2101.12] What good is it for someone to gain the whole world yet forfeit their soul?
[2101.80 → 2104.26] Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
[2104.62 → 2108.94] If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
[2109.64 → 2116.12] the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels.
[2117.08 → 2118.68] This is God's word.
[2118.82 → 2119.68] It is true.
[2119.68 → 2124.98] And he gives it to us because he loves us, and he wants us to follow him.
[2125.60 → 2128.76] So let me pray for us as we open up the word together.
[2129.56 → 2133.90] Father God, we thank you for these words of truth and life.
[2134.04 → 2138.40] Lord, without your word we are in darkness, in ignorance, in sin.
[2139.70 → 2141.94] Lord, we thank you that you have revealed yourself.
[2141.94 → 2150.06] And Lord, would you help us to hear your word in scripture that we might know you more and follow you closely.
[2150.54 → 2152.26] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2153.62 → 2158.22] And so this morning, what I want to do today is really just focus on verse 34.
[2158.46 → 2166.28] Because this is a great, concise verse that really defines for us what a disciple is.
[2166.28 → 2174.92] So here's how Jesus himself defines how we become a disciple and what is the essence of being a disciple.
[2175.50 → 2181.64] What we're told, we're told that Jesus called the crowds to himself and there in verse 34 says,
[2182.14 → 2188.24] whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves, take up the cross, and follow me.
[2189.26 → 2191.30] So this is what we're going to focus on today.
[2191.30 → 2199.04] Now the word disciple in the Greek literally just means a learner or a student.
[2199.98 → 2203.58] So a disciple is someone who is learning who Jesus is.
[2204.32 → 2211.36] Someone who is seeking to absorb all that Jesus taught, all that is true that he told us.
[2212.42 → 2218.56] So last Sunday, Pastor Len talked about Mary who sat at the feet of Jesus
[2218.56 → 2221.44] and listened to everything that he said.
[2221.78 → 2224.06] She was a follower of Jesus.
[2224.18 → 2224.92] She was a disciple.
[2225.86 → 2229.46] But being a disciple is not just about the mind.
[2229.58 → 2231.92] It's not just about learning things intellectually.
[2232.14 → 2235.44] It's actually a holistic life.
[2235.84 → 2238.50] Because we as people are holistic.
[2238.72 → 2239.56] So here's what I mean.
[2240.00 → 2245.88] Being a disciple involves three things that very helpfully start with H.
[2245.88 → 2249.44] the head, the heart, and the hands.
[2250.30 → 2253.66] So your head, what you know and believe,
[2254.18 → 2260.44] your heart refers to your affections, your loves, your virtues, who you are,
[2260.44 → 2265.80] and your hands is your actions and how you live in the world.
[2265.90 → 2267.50] Your head, your heart, your hands.
[2267.92 → 2271.32] This is all-encompassing of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.
[2271.32 → 2276.88] So now, if someone was to come to you and ask,
[2277.36 → 2282.18] how does Ladder CRC go about doing discipleship?
[2283.12 → 2285.64] How would you answer that?
[2287.06 → 2291.16] One reason it might be somewhat hard to answer
[2291.16 → 2294.58] is that people often have different ideas about what they mean
[2294.58 → 2298.76] when they say the word to be a disciple or discipleship.
[2298.76 → 2301.20] There's actually a good amount of confusion about that.
[2301.90 → 2304.24] Often when people talk about discipleship,
[2304.44 → 2307.18] they mean they want to be mentored.
[2308.04 → 2313.84] Like what they're saying is they want someone to personally care for them.
[2313.92 → 2319.18] They want someone else to pour into their spiritual growth.
[2320.10 → 2325.12] And of course, that can be really helpful as a way to grow in Christ.
[2325.12 → 2327.82] So sometimes, I think somewhat erroneously,
[2328.02 → 2330.54] but we'll use the word, I am being discipled,
[2330.58 → 2332.26] which means just I'm being mentored.
[2333.58 → 2336.62] But that's not exactly how the Bible talks about it.
[2337.48 → 2341.54] And so what I want us to understand is what the Bible means,
[2341.62 → 2344.84] especially here by this word disciple or being a disciple.
[2345.26 → 2348.82] From a biblical perspective, a disciple or discipleship
[2348.82 → 2351.74] is being a follower of Christ.
[2352.30 → 2356.50] And therefore, it involves everything that happens for a believer.
[2357.06 → 2359.22] So whether it is the Sunday gathering,
[2360.02 → 2363.34] whether it is being involved in community like a small group,
[2363.86 → 2367.48] whether it's in the morning you're doing your devotional time,
[2367.64 → 2371.98] or whether you have a mentor, and you're having one-on-one conversations,
[2371.98 → 2382.18] whatever it is that you do with intentionality to know Jesus and to follow Jesus is discipleship.
[2383.38 → 2384.44] So Jesus says,
[2385.02 → 2390.04] whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.
[2390.90 → 2392.92] So notice what is not in this verse.
[2393.32 → 2394.88] There is no ministry program.
[2394.88 → 2400.04] There is no focus also on spiritual disciplines,
[2400.24 → 2402.72] what the church has practiced throughout the ages,
[2402.94 → 2408.08] such as prayer, Bible reading, service, fasting, giving,
[2408.16 → 2415.30] all of these things that are good in the natural outcome of being a follower of Jesus,
[2415.60 → 2419.86] but these are not things that define a Christian.
[2419.86 → 2424.66] What defines a Christian, Jesus tells us,
[2425.18 → 2429.54] is just beginning with the only possible beginning point for a Christian,
[2429.92 → 2431.70] and that is Jesus Christ himself.
[2432.70 → 2435.62] So being a disciple is all about following Jesus.
[2436.58 → 2437.64] And this is important.
[2439.52 → 2441.64] Notice he does not say where he's going.
[2442.80 → 2445.16] He does not tell us what he is doing.
[2446.16 → 2447.62] So maybe as a kid,
[2447.62 → 2450.48] I remember this,
[2450.64 → 2451.38] and I'm not sure,
[2451.44 → 2453.26] but I can't remember my kids ever doing this,
[2453.30 → 2453.78] so I don't know,
[2453.84 → 2455.88] maybe it's not like popular anymore,
[2456.10 → 2458.06] but there's a kid's game called Follow the Leader.
[2458.90 → 2460.18] I don't know if you've ever played this,
[2460.52 → 2461.76] where one kid,
[2461.84 → 2462.58] you get a bunch of kids,
[2462.64 → 2463.22] and one kid is like,
[2463.28 → 2464.06] okay, I'm going to be the leader,
[2464.18 → 2465.60] and everyone else gets in line,
[2465.78 → 2466.84] and they have to follow.
[2467.06 → 2468.94] And so wherever the leader goes,
[2469.80 → 2470.88] everyone else has to go.
[2470.96 → 2471.90] Whatever they do,
[2472.20 → 2474.06] you have to do as well.
[2474.06 → 2474.64] You know,
[2474.70 → 2475.50] so the kid might,
[2475.84 → 2476.12] you know,
[2476.22 → 2478.42] slide down the stairs on his belly head first,
[2478.50 → 2479.76] and everyone has to go behind.
[2480.14 → 2482.50] Or the kid might climb up into a tree,
[2482.62 → 2483.98] so everyone has to climb the tree.
[2484.70 → 2485.34] Or, you know,
[2485.38 → 2486.46] jump across a stream,
[2486.62 → 2486.98] and everyone,
[2487.14 → 2487.32] you know,
[2487.40 → 2487.76] follows,
[2487.92 → 2488.48] and, you know,
[2488.50 → 2489.16] you have to be brave,
[2489.24 → 2489.94] you have to follow,
[2490.08 → 2490.84] you can't question,
[2491.30 → 2492.32] you got to follow the leader.
[2493.22 → 2494.76] You have to do whatever they do,
[2494.80 → 2496.04] and go wherever they go.
[2496.66 → 2499.38] And I think that gets to the heart of what it means to be a disciple.
[2499.94 → 2500.32] Right?
[2500.32 → 2502.14] We've heard the call of Jesus,
[2502.76 → 2508.36] and then we commit ourselves so fully to him that wherever he goes,
[2509.32 → 2510.76] we are with him,
[2511.10 → 2513.38] and he is with us.
[2514.92 → 2515.92] And so let's take,
[2516.10 → 2516.28] you know,
[2516.32 → 2520.98] those are some topics that we need to talk about when it comes to discipleship,
[2521.06 → 2523.32] to get to the essence of what a disciple is,
[2523.52 → 2524.50] a follower of Jesus.
[2525.04 → 2527.56] But now let's dig into this passage some more,
[2527.56 → 2532.94] and I want to see briefly three things about what a disciple is.
[2533.90 → 2534.34] First,
[2534.82 → 2536.86] a disciple is someone who is called by Jesus.
[2538.08 → 2538.54] Second,
[2538.82 → 2540.24] in hearing that call,
[2540.76 → 2542.96] we then commit our whole lives to him.
[2543.88 → 2544.76] And then third,
[2545.34 → 2548.32] in committing ourselves in radical trust to Jesus,
[2548.58 → 2551.32] we learn this sense of contentment,
[2551.64 → 2555.24] where we find that Jesus is better than everything else.
[2555.24 → 2557.94] So let's look at this.
[2558.88 → 2561.42] Looking at this passage in Mark chapter 8,
[2561.52 → 2564.14] we begin with the call of a disciple.
[2564.36 → 2565.38] So that's our first point,
[2565.46 → 2566.52] the call of a disciple.
[2567.54 → 2568.70] And the point here,
[2569.20 → 2571.78] that there is no becoming a disciple
[2571.78 → 2575.06] unless you've heard the call of Jesus.
[2576.42 → 2577.32] Our passage says,
[2577.44 → 2577.62] again,
[2577.62 → 2581.24] then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples
[2581.24 → 2582.30] and said,
[2582.42 → 2584.02] whoever wants to be my disciple
[2584.02 → 2585.42] must deny themselves,
[2585.64 → 2586.30] take up the cross,
[2586.34 → 2586.92] and follow me.
[2587.42 → 2588.74] So look at what Jesus is doing.
[2589.12 → 2592.30] Jesus has this large group of people,
[2592.44 → 2593.46] maybe hundreds of people,
[2593.46 → 2594.76] who are following him
[2594.76 → 2597.24] and wanting to listen to what he has to say
[2597.24 → 2599.14] and wants to be fed by him
[2599.14 → 2600.00] and see miracles.
[2600.24 → 2602.34] This is like high entertainment for that day.
[2602.70 → 2604.18] Jesus is amazing and attractive.
[2604.44 → 2605.24] They're following him.
[2605.24 → 2606.90] But then he stops.
[2607.24 → 2608.66] He turns to the crowd
[2608.66 → 2611.84] who are already, in a sense, following him.
[2612.22 → 2615.08] But then he invites them into a relationship
[2615.08 → 2617.34] of being a disciple.
[2618.00 → 2619.98] So that automatically tells us
[2619.98 → 2621.74] that there's a difference here
[2621.74 → 2623.86] between merely being attracted to Jesus,
[2624.06 → 2625.04] interested in Jesus,
[2625.48 → 2628.08] and being a disciple of Jesus.
[2629.10 → 2632.24] Jesus himself said in John 6, verse 44,
[2632.24 → 2634.54] No one can come to me
[2634.54 → 2638.28] unless the Father who sent me draws them,
[2638.74 → 2640.52] and I will raise them up on the last day.
[2641.18 → 2642.94] So the gospel always begins
[2642.94 → 2644.92] with God's initiative,
[2645.08 → 2646.62] God's pursuit of us.
[2647.22 → 2648.72] And the call to discipleship
[2648.72 → 2650.20] is by grace,
[2650.98 → 2653.18] whereby Jesus reveals himself
[2653.18 → 2654.96] to us
[2654.96 → 2657.80] in order to claim us
[2657.80 → 2658.78] as his own.
[2658.78 → 2660.60] So in the call,
[2660.70 → 2660.82] then,
[2660.90 → 2662.02] it always involves
[2662.02 → 2663.36] a revelation
[2663.36 → 2664.86] of who Jesus is.
[2664.86 → 2665.70] Not just to see him
[2665.70 → 2666.90] as this interesting guy,
[2667.20 → 2668.22] but you see
[2668.22 → 2670.32] that he is the son of God.
[2671.18 → 2673.04] That he died for humanity,
[2673.62 → 2674.70] carrying the weight
[2674.70 → 2675.60] of our sin.
[2676.18 → 2677.20] Dying on the cross,
[2677.26 → 2678.64] the death that we deserve to die.
[2679.32 → 2680.64] And then conquering death,
[2681.08 → 2681.78] conquering the dominion
[2682.40 → 2683.34] of darkness,
[2683.78 → 2684.86] on the third day,
[2684.98 → 2686.36] rising again from the dead,
[2686.46 → 2687.50] ascending into heaven
[2687.50 → 2688.64] at the right hand of the Father,
[2688.78 → 2690.32] where he reigns and rules,
[2691.08 → 2693.66] and seeing that he sends his spirit
[2693.66 → 2696.42] to those who put their trust in him.
[2697.48 → 2699.08] We can't follow Jesus
[2699.08 → 2701.06] unless we know who he is
[2701.06 → 2701.94] and what he has done.
[2703.26 → 2704.00] But then,
[2704.18 → 2706.44] when we individually,
[2707.06 → 2708.50] through the preaching of the word,
[2708.64 → 2710.16] we hear that call,
[2710.16 → 2712.30] and the Holy Spirit
[2712.30 → 2714.68] does that work in our hearts,
[2714.74 → 2715.76] not by ourselves,
[2715.94 → 2717.04] but by his grace
[2717.04 → 2718.32] and his divine initiative,
[2719.14 → 2721.54] then our eyes are opened,
[2722.24 → 2723.58] we can see Jesus,
[2724.06 → 2726.06] and then our proper response
[2726.06 → 2726.96] to this call
[2726.96 → 2729.22] is not simply to believe
[2729.22 → 2731.10] everything that Jesus said he is,
[2731.14 → 2732.96] because even the demons do that.
[2733.50 → 2735.60] The call of Christ
[2735.60 → 2736.74] is the call
[2736.74 → 2737.98] to radically
[2737.98 → 2739.66] trust in him.
[2740.20 → 2741.22] It's a complete
[2741.22 → 2742.58] change
[2742.58 → 2743.52] of direction,
[2743.88 → 2744.70] a complete turning
[2744.70 → 2745.48] upside down
[2745.48 → 2746.36] and inside out,
[2746.44 → 2748.14] and a complete reorientation
[2748.14 → 2749.82] of our heart,
[2749.88 → 2751.18] of complete trust.
[2752.26 → 2752.82] That's why
[2752.82 → 2753.74] when Peter preaches
[2753.74 → 2754.50] on Pentecost,
[2754.56 → 2755.68] he's declaring the gospel,
[2756.40 → 2757.02] and it says
[2757.02 → 2758.04] the people were cut
[2758.04 → 2759.02] to the heart
[2759.02 → 2760.20] and convicted,
[2760.62 → 2761.32] and they say,
[2761.52 → 2762.34] what must we do
[2762.34 → 2763.14] to be saved?
[2763.80 → 2764.84] So that's the response.
[2764.90 → 2765.80] They heard the call,
[2766.74 → 2767.74] they see Jesus,
[2767.88 → 2768.76] they see their sin,
[2769.50 → 2770.56] what must we do?
[2770.66 → 2771.62] What's the response?
[2771.82 → 2772.42] Peter says,
[2772.54 → 2772.90] repent
[2772.90 → 2774.24] and be baptized.
[2775.32 → 2775.50] Right?
[2775.60 → 2777.00] Turn away from yourself,
[2777.40 → 2778.16] following yourself,
[2778.24 → 2779.06] being your own Lord,
[2779.16 → 2779.58] which is
[2779.58 → 2780.86] what we have been doing
[2780.86 → 2782.06] ever since Adam and Eve
[2782.06 → 2783.28] disobeyed God,
[2783.36 → 2784.24] decided they will
[2784.24 → 2785.98] make their own way,
[2786.06 → 2787.14] they will be their own leader,
[2787.82 → 2788.92] and they are baptized
[2788.92 → 2790.04] into Christ,
[2790.30 → 2791.54] meaning we identify
[2791.54 → 2792.88] with Christ
[2792.88 → 2793.64] in his death
[2793.64 → 2794.24] and resurrection.
[2795.68 → 2796.32] And basically,
[2796.48 → 2796.60] then,
[2796.66 → 2797.18] what it means
[2797.18 → 2798.60] is to allow God
[2798.60 → 2800.52] the right to be God
[2800.52 → 2802.40] in and through our lives.
[2803.02 → 2804.44] It's to turn away
[2804.44 → 2805.54] from us being
[2805.54 → 2806.84] the centre of everything,
[2807.20 → 2808.38] the centre of our lives,
[2808.52 → 2809.30] in our families,
[2809.42 → 2810.02] in our workplace,
[2810.22 → 2810.86] in our school,
[2811.52 → 2813.36] where it's self-absorption,
[2813.62 → 2815.14] and instead giving Christ
[2815.14 → 2817.22] the right to be himself
[2817.22 → 2818.56] because he is Lord
[2818.56 → 2820.90] in and through us.
[2820.90 → 2823.56] So here's the question
[2823.56 → 2824.32] for us this morning.
[2825.80 → 2827.18] Have you heard the call
[2827.18 → 2829.18] of Christ in your life?
[2830.40 → 2831.82] Have you heard the gospel?
[2832.66 → 2833.96] Have you seen that it's
[2833.96 → 2834.94] God's initiative
[2834.94 → 2836.10] and his grace
[2836.10 → 2837.86] whereby he saves you
[2837.86 → 2839.22] and makes you a child of God?
[2840.18 → 2840.50] Then,
[2840.72 → 2842.48] has he revealed himself to you
[2842.48 → 2843.72] and have you responded
[2843.72 → 2844.48] to his call?
[2844.92 → 2846.62] In seeing that,
[2846.62 → 2848.46] have you said yes
[2848.46 → 2849.34] and that means
[2849.34 → 2850.60] I must totally
[2850.60 → 2852.16] turn my life over to him?
[2852.26 → 2852.50] Not,
[2852.96 → 2853.34] yes,
[2853.62 → 2854.16] but,
[2854.82 → 2856.22] I kind of want to
[2856.22 → 2858.32] still be my own Lord.
[2858.50 → 2859.66] I have all these identities
[2859.66 → 2861.62] that are so important to me
[2861.62 → 2863.28] where Christ,
[2863.44 → 2863.66] therefore,
[2863.76 → 2864.70] is not the centre
[2864.70 → 2865.36] of your life.
[2867.88 → 2869.32] We can't follow Jesus
[2869.32 → 2870.18] as a disciple
[2870.18 → 2871.30] if we have not heard
[2871.30 → 2872.22] his call.
[2872.98 → 2874.40] So that's how it begins,
[2874.48 → 2875.50] with the call of grace.
[2875.50 → 2876.88] But the grace of Jesus
[2876.88 → 2878.40] demands total
[2878.40 → 2879.44] and absolute
[2879.44 → 2880.60] allegiance.
[2881.02 → 2881.60] And this is why
[2881.60 → 2882.50] we must move to
[2882.50 → 2883.56] the second thing we see,
[2884.36 → 2884.88] which is
[2884.88 → 2885.74] the commitment
[2885.74 → 2886.52] of a disciple.
[2887.10 → 2888.16] And that's the second point,
[2888.62 → 2889.24] the commitment
[2889.24 → 2890.14] of a disciple.
[2891.84 → 2893.56] It begins with God's call,
[2894.32 → 2895.96] but then what does Jesus do?
[2896.14 → 2896.92] He says,
[2897.06 → 2898.20] whoever wants to be
[2898.20 → 2899.08] my disciple,
[2899.28 → 2900.12] so there's the call,
[2901.08 → 2901.38] and, you know,
[2901.44 → 2902.52] it's to anyone,
[2902.84 → 2904.04] anyone can be my disciple,
[2904.04 → 2905.72] what's the response?
[2906.58 → 2908.10] They must deny themselves,
[2909.10 → 2910.18] take up their cross,
[2910.28 → 2910.90] and follow me.
[2911.92 → 2913.00] When Jesus calls us
[2913.00 → 2913.68] to be a disciple,
[2913.84 → 2914.52] he calls us
[2914.52 → 2915.96] to deny ourselves
[2915.96 → 2917.24] and put all
[2917.24 → 2918.06] of our trust
[2918.06 → 2918.64] in him.
[2920.26 → 2921.18] This is something
[2921.18 → 2922.16] Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[2922.16 → 2923.44] stresses in his
[2923.44 → 2924.66] classic book,
[2924.74 → 2926.82] The Call of Discipleship.
[2927.00 → 2928.06] Bonhoeffer writes this,
[2928.12 → 2929.22] and I have this one
[2929.22 → 2930.16] for you on the screen.
[2930.16 → 2933.76] He says,
[2933.98 → 2934.62] the cross
[2934.62 → 2936.46] is not the terrible end
[2936.46 → 2937.34] to an otherwise
[2937.34 → 2938.84] God-fearing and happy life,
[2939.22 → 2940.12] but it meets us
[2940.12 → 2940.86] at the beginning
[2940.86 → 2941.82] of our communion
[2941.82 → 2942.46] with Christ.
[2942.96 → 2944.50] When Christ calls a man,
[2945.00 → 2945.80] he bids him
[2945.80 → 2947.44] come and die.
[2948.56 → 2949.54] In other words,
[2949.60 → 2951.24] if Jesus is the Messiah
[2951.24 → 2952.04] who came
[2952.04 → 2953.98] to deny himself,
[2954.30 → 2954.60] right,
[2954.66 → 2956.04] and give his life
[2956.04 → 2957.16] to save us,
[2957.16 → 2958.20] it makes sense
[2958.20 → 2959.24] that it will also
[2959.24 → 2960.14] mean dying
[2960.14 → 2961.28] ourselves
[2961.28 → 2963.06] in order to follow him.
[2964.02 → 2965.00] The same Jesus
[2965.00 → 2965.64] who said,
[2965.80 → 2966.96] I came, and I want
[2966.96 → 2967.42] to give you
[2967.42 → 2968.42] abundant life
[2968.42 → 2969.78] also says,
[2970.26 → 2970.72] follow me
[2970.72 → 2972.00] into that life
[2972.00 → 2973.94] by denying yourself.
[2975.38 → 2976.32] What Jesus
[2976.32 → 2977.02] is saying here
[2977.02 → 2977.94] is that the response
[2977.94 → 2978.64] to grace
[2978.64 → 2979.96] is a radical trust
[2979.96 → 2981.22] that recognizes
[2981.22 → 2982.36] that you can't
[2982.36 → 2983.04] hold on
[2983.04 → 2984.54] to your old life
[2984.54 → 2986.32] and have Jesus too.
[2987.16 → 2989.22] As we read
[2989.22 → 2989.82] the Gospels,
[2989.90 → 2990.78] we begin to see
[2990.78 → 2992.88] as Jesus is unpacking
[2992.88 → 2993.94] and explaining
[2993.94 → 2994.66] what it means
[2994.66 → 2995.38] to be a disciple,
[2995.84 → 2996.64] we start to see
[2996.64 → 2997.22] more and more
[2997.22 → 2999.00] about what he means
[2999.00 → 2999.48] by that.
[3001.16 → 3002.78] So in a parallel passage
[3002.78 → 3003.78] in Luke 14,
[3003.96 → 3004.86] Jesus says this.
[3005.68 → 3006.68] It's a very shocking
[3006.68 → 3007.12] statement.
[3007.12 → 3008.50] If anyone
[3008.50 → 3009.50] comes to me
[3009.50 → 3011.42] and does not hate
[3011.42 → 3012.88] father and mother,
[3013.40 → 3014.32] wife and children,
[3014.48 → 3015.30] brothers and sisters,
[3015.50 → 3015.70] yes,
[3015.76 → 3016.88] even their own life,
[3017.16 → 3017.92] such a person
[3017.92 → 3019.22] cannot be
[3019.22 → 3020.28] my disciple.
[3021.48 → 3022.18] So now,
[3022.26 → 3022.92] is he really
[3022.92 → 3023.78] calling us
[3023.78 → 3024.42] to hate
[3024.42 → 3025.40] our parents,
[3025.88 → 3026.48] to hate
[3026.48 → 3027.16] our spouses,
[3027.30 → 3027.66] to hate
[3027.66 → 3028.26] our children,
[3028.82 → 3029.20] to hate
[3029.20 → 3029.66] ourselves?
[3030.70 → 3030.94] Right?
[3031.00 → 3031.34] For instance,
[3031.44 → 3032.16] isn't the fifth
[3032.16 → 3032.72] commandment
[3032.72 → 3033.62] to honour
[3033.62 → 3034.58] our father
[3034.58 → 3035.08] and mother?
[3035.72 → 3036.18] So what does
[3036.18 → 3036.82] Jesus mean?
[3037.76 → 3038.00] Well,
[3038.06 → 3038.78] he's using
[3038.78 → 3039.98] a Jewish idiom
[3039.98 → 3041.36] that's
[3041.36 → 3042.50] a declaration
[3042.50 → 3044.04] of preference.
[3045.32 → 3045.50] Right?
[3045.90 → 3046.14] So,
[3046.82 → 3049.26] Jacob,
[3049.62 → 3050.76] I loved.
[3051.12 → 3051.48] Esau,
[3051.56 → 3052.08] I hated.
[3052.54 → 3053.48] So it's this
[3053.48 → 3054.40] idiom where you're
[3054.40 → 3055.22] saying there's a
[3055.22 → 3056.08] preference for one
[3056.08 → 3056.52] thing over the
[3056.52 → 3056.80] other.
[3056.90 → 3057.44] It's not the same
[3057.44 → 3058.14] way as we use
[3058.14 → 3058.52] hate,
[3058.98 → 3060.48] but it's just a
[3060.48 → 3061.40] matter of ordering
[3061.40 → 3061.98] and preference.
[3062.62 → 3063.50] And what it shows
[3063.50 → 3065.24] us is that one of
[3065.24 → 3066.50] the central components
[3066.50 → 3067.44] of what it means
[3067.44 → 3068.38] to be a disciple
[3068.38 → 3070.26] is that discipleship
[3070.26 → 3071.60] is a reformation,
[3072.06 → 3073.00] a reordering
[3073.00 → 3073.84] of one's
[3073.84 → 3074.52] affections.
[3075.40 → 3076.12] What holds
[3076.12 → 3077.16] the central place
[3077.16 → 3077.70] in your heart?
[3078.64 → 3079.42] That's the question
[3079.42 → 3080.86] that we need to ask.
[3081.56 → 3082.50] What is the most
[3082.50 → 3083.52] important thing
[3083.52 → 3084.46] in your existence?
[3085.34 → 3086.16] And what we're told
[3086.16 → 3086.64] in Scripture
[3086.64 → 3087.68] is that a true
[3087.68 → 3088.40] disciple
[3088.40 → 3089.76] is someone who
[3089.76 → 3090.84] takes the life
[3090.84 → 3091.42] of Jesus,
[3091.62 → 3092.66] the person of Jesus,
[3093.02 → 3094.12] the way of Jesus,
[3094.12 → 3095.86] to be the centre
[3095.86 → 3097.12] of who they are.
[3097.18 → 3097.62] They take on
[3097.62 → 3098.12] a whole new
[3098.12 → 3098.56] identity.
[3100.00 → 3100.90] And it's an
[3100.90 → 3101.66] identity that
[3101.66 → 3104.30] replaces the
[3104.30 → 3105.68] former sense
[3105.68 → 3106.82] of who they are.
[3106.96 → 3107.72] So Paul says,
[3107.86 → 3108.78] if anyone is in
[3108.78 → 3109.26] Christ,
[3109.86 → 3110.94] the new creation
[3110.94 → 3111.84] has come.
[3112.00 → 3112.98] If anyone is in
[3112.98 → 3113.46] Christ,
[3114.12 → 3114.92] new creation.
[3115.72 → 3116.74] The old has
[3116.74 → 3117.30] gone,
[3117.48 → 3118.68] the new has
[3118.68 → 3119.06] come.
[3119.76 → 3120.52] And that means
[3120.52 → 3121.16] we can't have
[3121.16 → 3121.96] Jesus as our
[3121.96 → 3123.56] Saviour and still
[3123.56 → 3125.04] reject his total
[3125.04 → 3126.12] authority over us.
[3126.12 → 3127.12] God is in
[3127.12 → 3127.56] God.
[3127.56 → 3127.82] And I think
[3127.82 → 3128.12] that's what
[3128.12 → 3128.92] Jesus is saying
[3128.92 → 3129.66] in verse 38
[3129.66 → 3130.38] in our passage,
[3130.72 → 3131.46] where he says,
[3131.60 → 3132.16] if anyone is
[3132.16 → 3133.02] ashamed of me
[3133.02 → 3133.82] and my words
[3133.82 → 3134.64] in this adulterous
[3134.64 → 3135.06] and sinful
[3135.06 → 3135.68] generation,
[3136.40 → 3137.02] the Son of Man
[3137.02 → 3137.58] will be ashamed
[3137.58 → 3138.22] of them
[3138.22 → 3139.12] when he comes
[3139.12 → 3139.78] in his Father's
[3139.78 → 3140.26] glory.
[3141.74 → 3142.56] So how do we
[3142.56 → 3143.46] not be ashamed
[3143.46 → 3143.96] of Jesus
[3143.96 → 3144.80] and his words?
[3145.54 → 3146.10] And the answer
[3146.10 → 3147.60] is by surrendering
[3147.60 → 3148.76] to them
[3148.76 → 3149.82] and following
[3149.82 → 3151.14] them wholeheartedly.
[3151.14 → 3152.88] And that's
[3152.88 → 3153.50] why we have
[3153.50 → 3154.04] to reckon
[3154.04 → 3154.84] with the question
[3154.84 → 3155.70] of what will
[3155.70 → 3156.88] it cost me
[3156.88 → 3158.32] to follow Christ?
[3159.32 → 3159.88] What will it
[3159.88 → 3160.56] cost me to
[3160.56 → 3161.10] follow Christ?
[3161.42 → 3162.04] And the only
[3162.04 → 3162.72] honest,
[3163.20 → 3163.72] realistic,
[3164.50 → 3165.24] but ultimately
[3165.24 → 3165.98] life-giving
[3165.98 → 3167.44] answer is
[3167.44 → 3167.86] everything.
[3168.86 → 3169.92] It will take
[3169.92 → 3170.90] everything to
[3170.90 → 3171.52] follow Christ.
[3172.56 → 3173.36] It's going to
[3173.36 → 3174.80] redefine how
[3174.80 → 3175.38] I relate to
[3175.38 → 3175.96] my family.
[3176.92 → 3177.70] It's going to
[3177.70 → 3178.36] change how I
[3178.36 → 3178.74] view my
[3178.74 → 3179.28] sexuality.
[3179.28 → 3180.94] it's going
[3180.94 → 3181.42] to change
[3181.42 → 3182.18] how I
[3182.18 → 3182.62] see my
[3182.62 → 3183.32] purpose,
[3184.50 → 3184.98] the purpose
[3184.98 → 3185.62] of my work
[3185.62 → 3186.36] in the world.
[3187.22 → 3188.02] How I think
[3188.02 → 3189.28] about politics
[3189.28 → 3190.74] and race
[3190.74 → 3191.72] and justice,
[3192.14 → 3192.92] how I use
[3192.92 → 3193.44] my money,
[3193.62 → 3194.24] how I use
[3194.24 → 3195.24] my words,
[3195.62 → 3196.24] how I spend
[3196.24 → 3196.86] my time,
[3197.06 → 3197.50] everything.
[3198.26 → 3199.04] Everything gets
[3199.04 → 3199.74] rearranged
[3199.74 → 3200.62] under the
[3200.62 → 3201.30] lordship of
[3201.30 → 3201.64] Jesus.
[3202.30 → 3203.06] And that is
[3203.06 → 3204.72] so challenging
[3204.72 → 3205.46] to us.
[3207.00 → 3207.78] There's an
[3207.78 → 3208.54] example of
[3208.54 → 3209.28] the challenge
[3209.28 → 3210.02] that this
[3210.02 → 3210.54] is,
[3210.66 → 3211.30] this call
[3211.30 → 3212.24] of discipleship,
[3213.00 → 3213.92] two chapters
[3213.92 → 3214.52] later in
[3214.52 → 3215.00] Mark chapter
[3215.00 → 3215.30] 10.
[3215.82 → 3216.26] We read
[3216.26 → 3216.62] about the
[3216.62 → 3217.06] rich young
[3217.06 → 3217.38] ruler.
[3218.80 → 3219.08] And it
[3219.08 → 3219.68] gives us a
[3219.68 → 3220.28] picture of
[3220.28 → 3220.98] a man who
[3220.98 → 3221.86] is disciplined
[3221.86 → 3222.76] in the ways
[3222.76 → 3223.54] of God,
[3224.18 → 3224.90] but who
[3224.90 → 3226.06] refuses to
[3226.06 → 3226.96] deny himself
[3226.96 → 3228.02] and therefore
[3228.02 → 3228.98] loses the
[3228.98 → 3229.92] very goal of
[3229.92 → 3230.26] being a
[3230.26 → 3230.60] disciple,
[3230.76 → 3231.08] which is to
[3231.08 → 3231.56] have Jesus
[3231.56 → 3232.72] as the centre
[3232.72 → 3233.52] of your
[3233.52 → 3233.98] life.
[3234.64 → 3235.34] So remember
[3235.34 → 3235.90] the story.
[3236.90 → 3237.40] There's this
[3237.40 → 3237.90] young,
[3238.04 → 3238.40] rich,
[3239.02 → 3239.46] probably
[3239.46 → 3239.98] handsome
[3239.98 → 3240.44] guy,
[3241.08 → 3241.68] runs up
[3241.68 → 3242.16] to Jesus.
[3242.46 → 3242.98] He says,
[3243.46 → 3244.02] good teacher,
[3244.18 → 3244.84] what must I
[3244.84 → 3245.18] do to
[3245.18 → 3245.90] inherit eternal
[3245.90 → 3246.36] life?
[3246.92 → 3247.64] And he's
[3247.64 → 3248.22] running up.
[3248.28 → 3248.60] He is
[3248.60 → 3249.40] sincere.
[3250.14 → 3250.80] He's a
[3250.80 → 3251.50] seeker of
[3251.50 → 3251.88] God.
[3253.20 → 3253.46] And then
[3253.46 → 3254.00] how does
[3254.00 → 3254.72] Jesus respond?
[3254.78 → 3255.08] He goes
[3255.08 → 3255.34] through this
[3255.34 → 3255.74] whole list
[3255.74 → 3256.30] of commands.
[3256.42 → 3256.78] He says,
[3256.88 → 3257.00] well,
[3257.04 → 3257.24] you know
[3257.24 → 3257.80] the commandments.
[3258.48 → 3258.70] You shall
[3258.70 → 3259.22] not murder.
[3259.34 → 3259.54] You shall
[3259.54 → 3259.96] not commit
[3259.96 → 3260.42] adultery.
[3260.54 → 3260.70] You shall
[3260.70 → 3261.22] not steal.
[3261.36 → 3261.54] You shall
[3261.54 → 3261.86] not give
[3261.86 → 3262.52] false testimony.
[3262.98 → 3263.22] You shall
[3263.22 → 3263.90] not defraud.
[3264.02 → 3264.36] Honour your
[3264.36 → 3264.80] father and
[3264.80 → 3265.04] mother.
[3265.04 → 3266.92] And we
[3266.92 → 3267.56] might think
[3267.56 → 3269.20] that discipleship
[3269.20 → 3270.26] is like that.
[3270.54 → 3271.18] That basically
[3271.18 → 3271.88] being a Christian
[3271.88 → 3272.28] is about
[3272.28 → 3273.64] keeping the
[3273.64 → 3274.10] rules,
[3274.50 → 3275.32] following the
[3275.32 → 3275.80] commands.
[3276.60 → 3277.56] If so,
[3278.02 → 3278.78] this rich
[3278.78 → 3279.44] young ruler
[3279.44 → 3280.44] must be
[3280.44 → 3281.46] an amazing
[3281.46 → 3282.30] disciple.
[3283.10 → 3283.90] Because after
[3283.90 → 3284.82] Jesus lists out
[3284.82 → 3285.46] these commands,
[3285.60 → 3286.06] he says,
[3286.56 → 3287.50] all of these
[3287.50 → 3288.52] I have kept
[3288.52 → 3289.60] since I was
[3289.60 → 3290.06] a boy.
[3290.06 → 3291.80] And notice,
[3292.06 → 3292.60] Jesus does
[3292.60 → 3293.44] not deny
[3293.44 → 3294.70] what the
[3294.70 → 3295.32] man said.
[3296.02 → 3296.38] And I
[3296.38 → 3297.20] believe the
[3297.20 → 3297.68] man was
[3297.68 → 3298.56] absolutely
[3298.56 → 3299.52] honest.
[3300.60 → 3301.28] Did he
[3301.28 → 3301.78] keep them
[3301.78 → 3302.34] as well
[3302.34 → 3302.80] as he
[3302.80 → 3303.54] thought he
[3303.54 → 3303.84] did?
[3303.96 → 3304.14] Well,
[3304.26 → 3304.54] no,
[3304.66 → 3305.00] probably
[3305.00 → 3305.52] not,
[3305.76 → 3306.22] especially
[3306.22 → 3307.24] according to
[3307.24 → 3307.48] the way
[3307.48 → 3308.30] Jesus taught
[3308.30 → 3308.66] us.
[3309.76 → 3310.34] But how
[3310.34 → 3311.00] does Jesus
[3311.00 → 3311.82] respond to
[3311.82 → 3312.20] the rich
[3312.20 → 3312.86] young ruler?
[3313.42 → 3314.10] He doesn't
[3314.10 → 3314.54] say,
[3315.16 → 3315.34] look,
[3315.42 → 3315.64] dude,
[3315.72 → 3316.42] you haven't
[3316.42 → 3317.30] really kept
[3317.30 → 3317.94] these commands.
[3318.14 → 3318.44] You need
[3318.44 → 3318.82] to be
[3318.82 → 3319.14] even
[3319.14 → 3319.90] more
[3319.90 → 3320.70] disciplined
[3320.70 → 3321.70] in keeping
[3321.70 → 3322.30] the commands.
[3322.48 → 3322.62] No,
[3322.68 → 3323.06] that's not
[3323.06 → 3323.46] what he
[3323.46 → 3323.92] says.
[3324.96 → 3325.68] He says,
[3325.84 → 3326.58] the passage
[3326.58 → 3326.86] says,
[3326.96 → 3327.56] Jesus looked
[3327.56 → 3327.96] at him
[3327.96 → 3328.42] and loved
[3328.42 → 3328.64] him.
[3329.36 → 3329.82] And first,
[3330.40 → 3330.76] that's,
[3330.86 → 3331.88] that's just,
[3332.00 → 3332.32] isn't that
[3332.32 → 3332.64] great?
[3333.38 → 3333.64] Right?
[3333.74 → 3334.60] His love
[3334.60 → 3334.98] is a
[3334.98 → 3335.50] willingness.
[3336.22 → 3336.76] It loves
[3336.76 → 3337.04] him.
[3337.12 → 3337.36] He's going
[3337.36 → 3337.72] to speak
[3337.72 → 3338.92] words that
[3338.92 → 3339.44] are hard
[3339.44 → 3339.80] for this
[3339.80 → 3340.12] man to
[3340.12 → 3340.42] hear,
[3341.20 → 3342.20] but there's
[3342.20 → 3342.72] a willingness
[3342.72 → 3343.26] to speak
[3343.26 → 3343.88] difficult
[3343.88 → 3345.60] truth into
[3345.60 → 3346.30] people's
[3346.30 → 3347.24] lives out
[3347.24 → 3348.42] of love.
[3349.44 → 3349.94] And it's
[3349.94 → 3351.68] not that
[3351.68 → 3352.24] you haven't
[3352.24 → 3352.66] been keeping
[3352.66 → 3353.24] the commands,
[3353.30 → 3353.64] you are
[3353.64 → 3354.14] keeping the
[3354.14 → 3354.54] commands,
[3354.88 → 3355.40] but there
[3355.40 → 3355.90] is something
[3355.90 → 3356.32] at the
[3356.32 → 3357.18] very centre
[3357.18 → 3358.50] that is
[3358.50 → 3358.82] missing.
[3359.28 → 3359.48] You're
[3359.48 → 3359.90] missing the
[3359.90 → 3360.28] point,
[3360.38 → 3360.84] Jesus says.
[3360.86 → 3361.02] There's
[3361.02 → 3361.66] something vital
[3361.66 → 3362.02] that is
[3362.02 → 3362.38] missing.
[3363.40 → 3363.88] One thing
[3363.88 → 3364.44] you lack,
[3364.58 → 3365.20] Jesus said,
[3365.48 → 3366.36] go sell
[3366.36 → 3366.98] everything you
[3366.98 → 3367.34] have and
[3367.34 → 3367.70] give to the
[3367.70 → 3368.66] poor and
[3368.66 → 3368.88] you will
[3368.88 → 3369.34] have treasure
[3369.34 → 3369.90] in heaven.
[3370.48 → 3370.82] And then
[3370.82 → 3371.38] here's the
[3371.38 → 3371.76] call to
[3371.76 → 3372.48] discipleship,
[3372.82 → 3373.70] then come
[3373.70 → 3375.20] follow me.
[3375.20 → 3377.46] And what
[3377.46 → 3377.72] are we
[3377.72 → 3378.26] told about
[3378.26 → 3378.62] the rich
[3378.62 → 3379.10] young ruler?
[3380.50 → 3381.06] It says,
[3381.22 → 3381.76] at this
[3381.76 → 3382.36] the man's
[3382.36 → 3383.12] face fell,
[3383.30 → 3383.70] he went
[3383.70 → 3384.46] away sad,
[3385.00 → 3386.12] because he
[3386.12 → 3387.50] had great
[3387.50 → 3387.90] wealth.
[3389.10 → 3389.44] Right?
[3389.50 → 3389.68] And so
[3389.68 → 3390.14] when Jesus
[3390.14 → 3391.00] says deny
[3391.00 → 3391.90] yourself and
[3391.90 → 3392.52] pick up your
[3392.52 → 3393.02] cross,
[3393.16 → 3393.84] he's not
[3393.84 → 3394.76] saying pick
[3394.76 → 3395.28] up my
[3395.28 → 3395.76] cross.
[3396.24 → 3396.68] We're not
[3396.68 → 3397.90] to die
[3397.90 → 3398.30] the way
[3398.30 → 3399.20] Jesus died,
[3399.40 → 3399.88] he's saying
[3399.88 → 3400.56] pick up your
[3400.56 → 3401.10] cross.
[3401.10 → 3401.14] cross.
[3401.76 → 3402.18] And what
[3402.18 → 3402.54] does that
[3402.54 → 3402.96] mean?
[3403.58 → 3404.10] Picking up
[3404.10 → 3404.60] your cross
[3404.60 → 3405.22] is dying
[3405.22 → 3406.14] to the
[3406.14 → 3408.00] lie of
[3408.00 → 3408.60] trying to
[3408.60 → 3409.02] be what
[3409.02 → 3409.58] God never
[3409.58 → 3410.32] intended you
[3410.32 → 3410.80] to be,
[3410.92 → 3411.58] so that you
[3411.58 → 3411.96] then can
[3411.96 → 3412.84] come alive
[3412.84 → 3413.38] to the
[3413.38 → 3414.72] reality of
[3414.72 → 3415.32] being restored
[3415.32 → 3415.92] back into
[3415.92 → 3416.44] fellowship with
[3416.44 → 3416.84] God,
[3418.06 → 3418.58] the God who
[3418.58 → 3419.12] made you and
[3419.12 → 3419.54] loves you.
[3420.48 → 3420.68] And so
[3420.68 → 3421.28] picking up your
[3421.28 → 3421.90] cross is this
[3421.90 → 3422.44] willingness to
[3422.44 → 3422.94] go through this
[3422.94 → 3424.06] painful stripping
[3424.06 → 3425.92] away of all
[3425.92 → 3426.56] the things that
[3426.56 → 3427.90] rob us of our
[3427.90 → 3429.40] ability to see
[3429.40 → 3430.20] Jesus clearly
[3430.20 → 3431.42] and to follow
[3431.42 → 3432.56] him fully.
[3433.48 → 3433.92] For the rich
[3433.92 → 3434.44] young ruler,
[3434.62 → 3435.34] his particular
[3435.34 → 3436.48] God was his
[3436.48 → 3436.82] wealth,
[3437.04 → 3437.86] his identity
[3437.86 → 3438.86] was his
[3438.86 → 3439.34] wealth.
[3440.06 → 3440.50] He went
[3440.50 → 3441.14] away sad
[3441.14 → 3441.72] because he
[3441.72 → 3442.22] had great
[3442.22 → 3442.48] wealth.
[3442.58 → 3442.86] This was
[3442.86 → 3443.46] central to
[3443.46 → 3444.78] his self-conception.
[3446.10 → 3446.68] Jesus didn't
[3446.68 → 3447.50] then chase him
[3447.50 → 3448.08] down and say,
[3448.24 → 3449.30] wait, okay,
[3449.44 → 3450.28] so I see that
[3450.28 → 3451.02] you want salvation
[3451.02 → 3452.08] and you want to
[3452.08 → 3452.74] keep your stuff.
[3453.26 → 3453.84] Look, we can
[3453.84 → 3454.34] work it out,
[3454.40 → 3454.86] we can make a
[3454.86 → 3455.08] deal.
[3455.58 → 3456.44] That's not what
[3456.44 → 3457.14] Jesus does.
[3457.54 → 3458.30] Jesus loves
[3458.30 → 3458.88] the man
[3458.88 → 3460.44] too much
[3460.44 → 3461.46] to allow him
[3461.46 → 3462.36] to maintain
[3462.36 → 3463.52] in his heart
[3463.52 → 3464.26] the idol
[3464.26 → 3465.20] and worship
[3465.20 → 3466.22] of a false
[3466.22 → 3466.58] God,
[3466.66 → 3467.24] of mammon.
[3467.96 → 3468.36] For that
[3468.36 → 3469.24] young man,
[3469.62 → 3470.16] riches was
[3470.16 → 3470.62] his God.
[3472.32 → 3473.34] For each
[3473.34 → 3474.66] one of us,
[3474.82 → 3475.48] picking up
[3475.48 → 3476.48] our cross
[3476.48 → 3477.62] is different.
[3479.00 → 3479.94] Here's another
[3479.94 → 3480.84] quote by
[3480.84 → 3481.46] Bonhoeffer.
[3481.52 → 3481.94] I'm sorry I
[3481.94 → 3482.42] don't have it
[3482.42 → 3482.92] on the screen,
[3483.16 → 3483.44] but I will
[3483.44 → 3483.98] read it to you.
[3484.84 → 3485.22] And he's
[3485.22 → 3485.66] talking about
[3485.66 → 3486.24] the idea
[3486.24 → 3487.04] of denying
[3487.04 → 3487.98] ourselves.
[3488.14 → 3488.64] He says,
[3489.30 → 3490.00] it may be
[3490.00 → 3490.58] a death
[3490.58 → 3491.78] like that
[3491.78 → 3492.38] of the first
[3492.38 → 3492.90] disciples
[3492.90 → 3493.70] who had
[3493.70 → 3494.10] to leave
[3494.10 → 3494.74] home and
[3494.74 → 3495.56] work to
[3495.56 → 3496.10] follow him.
[3496.92 → 3497.96] Or it
[3497.96 → 3498.46] may be a
[3498.46 → 3498.90] death like
[3498.90 → 3499.66] Luther's,
[3499.78 → 3500.32] Martin Luther,
[3500.76 → 3501.32] who had
[3501.32 → 3501.80] to leave
[3501.80 → 3502.42] the monastery
[3502.42 → 3503.04] and go
[3503.04 → 3503.64] into the
[3503.64 → 3504.00] world.
[3504.76 → 3505.28] But it
[3505.28 → 3505.80] is the
[3505.80 → 3506.68] same death
[3506.68 → 3507.82] every time.
[3508.58 → 3509.14] Death in
[3509.14 → 3509.96] Jesus Christ,
[3510.30 → 3510.76] the death
[3510.76 → 3511.52] of the old
[3511.52 → 3512.68] man at
[3512.68 → 3513.86] his call.
[3513.86 → 3516.30] So friends,
[3516.40 → 3516.78] what is the
[3516.78 → 3517.34] essence of
[3517.34 → 3517.64] being a
[3517.64 → 3518.42] disciple of
[3518.42 → 3518.86] Christ?
[3519.86 → 3520.54] It's having
[3520.54 → 3521.44] the central
[3521.44 → 3522.70] affections of
[3522.70 → 3523.48] our hearts
[3523.48 → 3525.60] reshaped around
[3525.60 → 3526.74] the person
[3526.74 → 3527.54] of Jesus
[3527.54 → 3528.80] and putting
[3528.80 → 3529.82] our total
[3529.82 → 3530.36] trust,
[3530.82 → 3531.58] finding our
[3531.58 → 3532.54] full identity
[3532.54 → 3533.82] in him
[3533.82 → 3534.22] alone.
[3534.38 → 3535.06] That is what
[3535.06 → 3535.64] a disciple
[3535.64 → 3536.14] is.
[3536.54 → 3537.28] They've heard
[3537.28 → 3538.06] the call,
[3538.40 → 3538.94] they've seen
[3538.94 → 3539.42] who Jesus
[3539.42 → 3539.98] is,
[3540.76 → 3541.38] and kind
[3541.38 → 3541.58] of, you
[3541.58 → 3541.66] know,
[3541.72 → 3542.16] the old
[3542.16 → 3543.08] four spiritual
[3543.08 → 3543.52] laws.
[3543.60 → 3543.86] They had
[3543.86 → 3544.34] the picture
[3544.34 → 3546.28] of a
[3546.28 → 3546.92] chair in
[3546.92 → 3547.22] the middle
[3547.22 → 3547.50] of a
[3547.50 → 3547.84] circle,
[3548.02 → 3548.34] and around
[3548.34 → 3548.76] the circle
[3548.76 → 3549.28] are all
[3549.28 → 3549.58] of the
[3549.58 → 3550.04] things of
[3550.04 → 3550.40] life,
[3550.48 → 3550.98] or job,
[3551.12 → 3551.42] family,
[3551.56 → 3551.80] friends,
[3551.86 → 3552.12] all this
[3552.12 → 3552.48] stuff,
[3552.80 → 3553.48] with you
[3553.48 → 3553.80] at the
[3553.80 → 3554.08] centre.
[3554.60 → 3554.86] This is
[3554.86 → 3555.10] how they
[3555.10 → 3555.50] explain the
[3555.50 → 3555.82] gospel.
[3556.60 → 3556.92] And then
[3556.92 → 3557.12] there's
[3557.12 → 3557.40] another
[3557.40 → 3557.92] circle
[3557.92 → 3559.58] where the
[3559.58 → 3560.12] cross is
[3560.12 → 3560.42] at the
[3560.42 → 3560.68] centre.
[3561.26 → 3561.76] That is
[3561.76 → 3561.98] it.
[3562.50 → 3562.90] That's
[3562.90 → 3563.16] what it
[3563.16 → 3563.44] means to
[3563.44 → 3563.68] be a
[3563.68 → 3564.06] disciple.
[3565.52 → 3565.98] Total
[3565.98 → 3566.38] trust,
[3566.52 → 3566.80] total
[3566.80 → 3567.98] realignment
[3567.98 → 3568.54] to put
[3568.54 → 3569.58] Christ as
[3569.58 → 3569.88] the
[3569.88 → 3570.24] centre,
[3570.38 → 3570.82] controlling
[3570.82 → 3571.36] centre of
[3571.36 → 3571.78] your life.
[3571.78 → 3572.98] And then
[3572.98 → 3573.52] that leads
[3573.52 → 3574.06] us to
[3574.06 → 3574.50] something
[3574.50 → 3574.76] really
[3574.76 → 3575.26] powerful.
[3575.78 → 3576.04] And that's
[3576.04 → 3576.66] our last
[3576.66 → 3577.02] point.
[3577.70 → 3578.20] Something that
[3578.20 → 3578.64] is ultimately
[3578.64 → 3579.36] freeing,
[3579.98 → 3580.38] and that
[3580.38 → 3580.88] is the
[3580.88 → 3581.94] contentment
[3581.94 → 3583.48] of simple
[3583.48 → 3584.02] obedience.
[3585.74 → 3586.98] So in
[3586.98 → 3588.22] Mark 8,
[3588.30 → 3589.04] verse 34,
[3589.30 → 3589.96] Jesus says,
[3590.10 → 3590.64] whoever wants
[3590.64 → 3591.10] to be my
[3591.10 → 3592.26] disciple must
[3592.26 → 3593.16] deny themselves,
[3593.72 → 3594.20] take up their
[3594.20 → 3594.64] cross,
[3594.96 → 3595.42] and follow
[3595.42 → 3595.70] me.
[3595.70 → 3597.72] obedience.
[3597.72 → 3599.98] Follow me.
[3600.94 → 3601.64] Obedience is
[3601.64 → 3602.98] simple when
[3602.98 → 3603.68] we do just
[3603.68 → 3604.18] what Jesus
[3604.18 → 3604.90] asks us to
[3604.90 → 3605.20] do.
[3605.96 → 3606.32] Nothing
[3606.32 → 3606.86] more,
[3607.96 → 3608.74] nothing less,
[3609.46 → 3609.88] and nothing
[3609.88 → 3610.34] different.
[3611.68 → 3612.28] And when we
[3612.28 → 3612.82] make things
[3612.82 → 3613.68] complicated
[3613.68 → 3614.38] instead of
[3614.38 → 3615.42] simple,
[3615.74 → 3616.66] when we
[3616.66 → 3617.66] get off
[3617.66 → 3618.22] track,
[3619.16 → 3619.56] what does
[3619.56 → 3620.18] Jesus do?
[3620.36 → 3621.58] He gently
[3621.58 → 3623.08] calls us
[3623.08 → 3623.86] again and
[3623.86 → 3624.44] again to
[3624.44 → 3625.30] return to
[3625.30 → 3626.50] him as
[3626.50 → 3627.04] our first
[3627.04 → 3627.40] love.
[3627.48 → 3627.76] He says
[3627.76 → 3628.10] again,
[3628.50 → 3629.52] follow me,
[3629.96 → 3630.84] be with
[3630.84 → 3631.34] me,
[3631.56 → 3632.32] learn from
[3632.32 → 3632.74] me,
[3633.14 → 3633.88] trust in
[3633.88 → 3634.20] me.
[3635.72 → 3636.20] And this
[3636.20 → 3637.04] contentment
[3637.04 → 3637.44] that we
[3637.44 → 3638.14] find in
[3638.14 → 3638.68] simple
[3638.68 → 3639.70] obedience to
[3639.70 → 3641.84] Jesus is
[3641.84 → 3642.54] also part of
[3642.54 → 3643.18] our mission
[3643.18 → 3644.18] and our
[3644.18 → 3644.84] witness in
[3644.84 → 3645.28] the world.
[3645.60 → 3645.96] And I want
[3645.96 → 3646.34] us to see
[3646.34 → 3646.72] this.
[3647.24 → 3647.94] That it is
[3647.94 → 3648.60] through our
[3648.60 → 3649.70] radical trust
[3649.70 → 3650.58] and then our
[3650.58 → 3651.54] simple obedience
[3651.54 → 3652.98] that we bear
[3652.98 → 3653.80] witness to
[3653.80 → 3654.14] the more
[3654.14 → 3655.00] excellent way
[3655.00 → 3655.42] of Jesus
[3655.42 → 3655.74] in the
[3655.74 → 3656.08] gospel.
[3656.74 → 3657.10] And therefore
[3657.10 → 3658.34] show the
[3658.34 → 3658.94] world that
[3658.94 → 3659.50] Jesus is
[3659.50 → 3659.86] better,
[3661.10 → 3661.96] that his
[3661.96 → 3662.90] steadfast love
[3662.90 → 3663.28] is better
[3663.28 → 3663.80] than life.
[3664.92 → 3665.22] In the
[3665.22 → 3666.08] words of the
[3666.08 → 3666.78] apostle Paul,
[3667.20 → 3667.58] we count
[3667.58 → 3668.60] everything as
[3668.60 → 3669.94] loss for
[3669.94 → 3670.94] the surpassing
[3670.94 → 3671.86] worth of
[3671.86 → 3672.64] knowing Christ
[3672.64 → 3673.26] Jesus as
[3673.26 → 3673.54] Lord.
[3674.08 → 3674.58] So here's
[3674.58 → 3674.84] what it
[3674.84 → 3675.20] means.
[3676.20 → 3676.68] In a
[3676.68 → 3678.12] world of
[3678.12 → 3679.92] materialism and
[3679.92 → 3680.72] greed and
[3680.72 → 3681.58] consumerism,
[3681.90 → 3682.28] it means
[3682.28 → 3682.98] becoming a
[3682.98 → 3683.84] people who
[3683.84 → 3684.96] are sacrificially
[3684.96 → 3686.72] generous because
[3686.72 → 3687.36] Jesus is
[3687.36 → 3687.70] better.
[3689.02 → 3689.48] In a
[3689.48 → 3690.32] world bent
[3690.32 → 3691.30] on immediate
[3691.30 → 3693.26] self-gratification,
[3693.60 → 3694.04] it means
[3694.04 → 3694.90] becoming people
[3694.90 → 3695.50] who actually
[3695.50 → 3696.10] know how to
[3696.10 → 3697.06] say no to
[3697.06 → 3698.02] certain desires
[3698.02 → 3699.20] for the sake of
[3699.20 → 3699.96] faithfulness to
[3699.96 → 3700.88] Jesus because
[3700.88 → 3702.62] it's worth it.
[3702.72 → 3703.56] Jesus is
[3703.56 → 3704.06] better.
[3705.18 → 3705.92] In a
[3705.92 → 3706.80] world that
[3706.80 → 3708.28] idolizes our
[3708.28 → 3709.56] personal autonomy
[3709.56 → 3710.40] and freedom,
[3710.98 → 3711.42] it means
[3711.42 → 3712.44] becoming people
[3712.44 → 3712.76] who are
[3712.76 → 3713.78] willing to
[3713.78 → 3714.84] give ourselves
[3714.84 → 3715.78] in relationship
[3715.78 → 3716.38] with others,
[3716.54 → 3716.96] bear one
[3716.96 → 3717.34] another's
[3717.34 → 3717.64] burdens,
[3718.42 → 3719.08] even when
[3719.08 → 3719.66] it's hard
[3719.66 → 3720.34] and costly
[3720.34 → 3721.88] because Jesus
[3721.88 → 3722.52] is better.
[3723.54 → 3724.42] And in a
[3724.42 → 3725.08] world that
[3725.08 → 3725.50] is so
[3725.50 → 3726.74] politicized,
[3727.24 → 3728.94] where people
[3728.94 → 3731.16] today seem
[3731.16 → 3731.64] to just want
[3731.64 → 3732.38] to diminish
[3732.38 → 3733.10] one another
[3733.10 → 3734.12] with our
[3734.12 → 3734.64] words and
[3734.64 → 3735.44] our actions,
[3736.02 → 3736.44] it means
[3736.44 → 3737.16] instead becoming
[3737.16 → 3737.78] people who
[3737.78 → 3738.66] see our
[3738.66 → 3739.32] neighbours as
[3739.32 → 3740.56] image bearers
[3740.56 → 3741.24] of God,
[3742.02 → 3742.74] and we do
[3742.74 → 3743.12] that because
[3743.12 → 3743.70] Jesus is
[3743.70 → 3743.98] better.
[3745.72 → 3746.30] Jesus is
[3746.30 → 3746.98] the one who
[3746.98 → 3747.94] has our
[3747.94 → 3749.04] loyalty and
[3749.04 → 3749.92] our love,
[3750.46 → 3751.34] and therefore,
[3751.58 → 3752.58] come what may,
[3752.72 → 3753.68] we don't live
[3753.68 → 3754.28] by the same
[3754.28 → 3755.36] logic of the
[3755.36 → 3755.72] world.
[3756.16 → 3756.70] We follow
[3756.70 → 3757.60] Jesus even
[3757.60 → 3758.22] when it means
[3758.22 → 3758.86] carrying our
[3758.86 → 3759.80] cross, denying
[3759.80 → 3761.00] ourselves, because
[3761.00 → 3761.76] following Jesus
[3761.76 → 3762.36] is better than
[3762.36 → 3762.60] life.
[3762.70 → 3763.22] Following Jesus
[3763.22 → 3764.50] is life, it
[3764.50 → 3765.06] is the abundant
[3765.06 → 3765.56] life that he
[3765.56 → 3766.30] promised us.
[3766.30 → 3767.38] That is our
[3767.38 → 3768.06] witness to the
[3768.06 → 3768.36] world.
[3769.82 → 3770.86] So we have to
[3770.86 → 3771.42] keep asking
[3771.42 → 3773.74] this, what
[3773.74 → 3775.38] does self-denial,
[3775.76 → 3776.50] what does denying
[3776.50 → 3777.28] ourselves and
[3777.28 → 3777.86] taking up our
[3777.86 → 3778.72] cross look like
[3778.72 → 3779.10] for me?
[3780.14 → 3781.06] What are some
[3781.06 → 3781.80] things in my
[3781.80 → 3782.60] life that Jesus
[3782.60 → 3783.78] is inviting me
[3783.78 → 3784.26] to learn to
[3784.26 → 3785.10] say no to,
[3785.40 → 3786.20] so that we
[3786.20 → 3786.98] can say a
[3786.98 → 3787.94] greater yes
[3787.94 → 3789.70] to him?
[3790.24 → 3791.04] And in doing
[3791.04 → 3791.54] so, to
[3791.54 → 3792.56] experience and
[3792.56 → 3793.66] taste more
[3793.66 → 3794.82] of his
[3794.82 → 3795.44] goodness and
[3795.44 → 3795.92] more of his
[3795.92 → 3796.26] life.
[3797.14 → 3797.88] This is what
[3797.88 → 3798.20] it means to
[3798.20 → 3798.40] be a
[3798.40 → 3799.02] disciple, to
[3799.02 → 3799.44] hear the
[3799.44 → 3800.92] call, to
[3800.92 → 3802.44] commit ourselves
[3802.44 → 3803.22] in radical
[3803.22 → 3803.82] trust to
[3803.82 → 3804.64] him, then
[3804.64 → 3805.82] it is a
[3805.82 → 3806.90] simple obedience
[3806.90 → 3807.70] in which we
[3807.70 → 3809.04] find contentment
[3809.04 → 3810.36] in our life
[3810.36 → 3811.16] in Christ and
[3811.16 → 3812.04] in doing so,
[3812.72 → 3813.78] we bear witness
[3813.78 → 3814.90] to the goodness
[3814.90 → 3815.58] of Jesus in
[3815.58 → 3815.92] the world.
[3816.90 → 3817.62] So let me
[3817.62 → 3818.34] pray for
[3818.34 → 3818.78] us.
[3819.82 → 3820.44] Would you
[3820.44 → 3820.86] join me in
[3820.86 → 3821.06] prayer?
[3821.06 → 3822.54] Father, we
[3822.54 → 3824.50] pray that you
[3824.50 → 3825.02] would help us
[3825.02 → 3825.88] to hear your
[3825.88 → 3827.06] call above the
[3827.06 → 3827.76] noise of the
[3827.76 → 3829.70] world, that
[3829.70 → 3830.40] you would help
[3830.40 → 3832.20] us to radically
[3832.20 → 3833.28] trust in you
[3833.28 → 3834.56] in ways that
[3834.56 → 3835.28] would seem foolish
[3835.28 → 3836.00] to the world,
[3836.64 → 3837.74] and Lord, in
[3837.74 → 3838.40] doing so, that
[3838.40 → 3839.48] we would find
[3839.48 → 3842.10] that your
[3842.10 → 3842.64] burden is
[3842.64 → 3844.36] light, that
[3844.36 → 3845.02] we would find
[3845.02 → 3846.12] true contentment,
[3846.12 → 3847.80] peace, and
[3847.80 → 3848.42] life, and
[3848.42 → 3849.34] joy that
[3849.34 → 3850.22] would be a
[3850.22 → 3850.82] witness to
[3850.82 → 3851.28] the world.
[3852.88 → 3853.98] Lord, search
[3853.98 → 3854.86] us and teach
[3854.86 → 3855.42] us what we
[3855.42 → 3856.14] need to deny
[3856.14 → 3856.76] in ourselves
[3856.76 → 3858.14] so that we
[3858.14 → 3858.74] might find our
[3858.74 → 3859.40] life in Christ.
[3859.90 → 3861.24] We pray for
[3861.24 → 3861.66] the work of
[3861.66 → 3862.26] your Holy Spirit
[3862.26 → 3863.24] in each one of
[3863.24 → 3863.56] us.
[3864.02 → 3864.62] In the name of
[3864.62 → 3865.84] Christ, amen.
[3876.12 → 3892.38] Lord, as we
[3892.38 → 3894.60] come to you
[3894.60 → 3896.60] to receive
[3896.60 → 3898.18] the food
[3898.18 → 3899.58] of the
[3899.58 → 3901.08] holy
[3901.08 → 3902.10] birth,
[3902.98 → 3903.60] say
[3903.60 → 3904.60] your
[3904.60 → 3905.34] truth
[3905.34 → 3907.76] and redeem
[3907.76 → 3908.62] us,
[3908.96 → 3910.00] shape and
[3910.00 → 3912.26] fashion us
[3912.26 → 3913.58] in your
[3913.58 → 3915.52] love and
[3915.52 → 3915.88] peace.
[3916.34 → 3917.28] And the
[3917.28 → 3919.10] light of
[3919.10 → 3919.80] Christ
[3919.80 → 3920.56] might
[3920.56 → 3921.84] receive
[3921.84 → 3923.12] today
[3923.12 → 3924.68] in our
[3924.68 → 3925.68] exodus
[3925.68 → 3928.28] and our
[3928.28 → 3929.22] deeds
[3929.22 → 3930.08] and our
[3930.08 → 3931.04] faith.
[3931.90 → 3932.36] Speak,
[3933.08 → 3933.90] O
[3933.90 → 3935.38] Lord, and
[3935.38 → 3938.16] fulfill us
[3938.16 → 3939.56] all your
[3939.56 → 3941.30] purposes
[3941.30 → 3943.22] for your
[3943.22 → 3945.26] glory.
[3945.26 → 3947.54] teach us
[3947.54 → 3955.46] for you
[3955.46 → 3956.58] teach us
[3956.58 → 3958.90] that
[3958.90 → 3960.30] in your
[3960.30 → 3960.84] vide
[3960.84 → 3961.74] and
[3961.74 → 3964.42] follow us
[3964.42 → 3964.64] to
[3964.64 → 3966.54] human ta-
[3966.54 → 3967.68] upon them
[3967.68 → 3975.10] Test our thoughts and our attitudes
[3975.10 → 3981.88] In the radiance of your beauty
[3981.88 → 3989.72] Cause our way to rise, cause our eyes to see
[3989.72 → 3996.92] Your majestic love and authority
[3996.92 → 4005.30] Spurs of power that can never fail
[4005.30 → 4012.50] Let the truth prevail over on me
[4012.50 → 4028.42] Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds
[4028.42 → 4036.80] Help us grasp the heights of your past cross
[4036.80 → 4043.18] Choose unchanged from the dawn of time
[4043.18 → 4049.18] Love will ever down through eternity
[4049.18 → 4057.56] And my grace will stand on your promises
[4057.56 → 4065.56] And my faith will walk as you walk with us
[4065.56 → 4072.56] Speak, O Lord, till your churches build
[4072.56 → 4080.94] And the earth is still with your glory
[4080.94 → 4097.94] Join me in a congregational prayer
[4097.94 → 4104.58] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning
[4104.58 → 4107.78] With thanksgiving, with a contrite heart
[4107.78 → 4110.80] With praise for your glory and your love
[4110.80 → 4112.80] And with our petitions
[4112.80 → 4117.38] We thank you for keeping us safe all this week
[4117.38 → 4120.24] And providing for us in all our needs
[4120.24 → 4122.56] We see your creation
[4122.56 → 4125.74] And the new life that springs up all around us
[4125.74 → 4127.38] And we stand amazed
[4127.38 → 4130.68] Each morning we wake up
[4130.68 → 4132.72] And we know that you are near
[4132.72 → 4135.80] That you never slumber nor sleep
[4135.80 → 4137.34] As you watch over us
[4137.34 → 4143.26] Yet you know, Lord, that we often fall short
[4143.26 → 4144.76] Not only as individuals
[4144.76 → 4146.22] But also as families
[4146.22 → 4148.12] As sets of friends
[4148.12 → 4149.78] And as a congregation
[4149.78 → 4154.34] Sins of community are so hard to see
[4154.34 → 4158.14] Open our eyes, Lord, to our pride
[4158.14 → 4159.74] And our self-serving
[4159.74 → 4161.80] Help us to see the tasks
[4161.80 → 4163.10] For which you have called us
[4163.10 → 4165.64] As individuals and as families
[4165.64 → 4168.66] And also as a congregation in this place
[4168.66 → 4174.40] Father, we pray for the needs of our congregation
[4174.40 → 4179.36] Bless the ministry of Jason and Nancy and Hannah among us
[4179.36 → 4182.84] Watch over the elders and deacons that you have appointed
[4182.84 → 4185.10] And all who labour in this church
[4185.10 → 4188.14] For without you, we labour in vain
[4188.14 → 4193.56] Lord, many among us struggle with illness
[4193.56 → 4198.06] Be with Joan and John Ram and John Van Tull
[4198.06 → 4204.76] And Julie and Diane and Mark and Pat and Greg
[4204.76 → 4210.32] And Annie and Andre and Shirley and Grace
[4210.32 → 4213.74] Grant healing and restoration
[4213.74 → 4218.38] But above all, your loving presence in their lives
[4218.38 → 4223.40] We pray for George Cullen and the larger family around him
[4223.40 → 4225.06] In this time of their loss
[4225.06 → 4229.40] Remember, Lord, and be near them
[4229.40 → 4233.46] Many, many members of our congregation
[4233.46 → 4235.40] Have been isolated in various homes
[4235.40 → 4236.68] And only very recently
[4236.68 → 4239.14] Has some visitation been allowed
[4239.14 → 4241.52] Behold up before you
[4241.52 → 4243.98] Cor and Hank and Carl
[4243.98 → 4245.52] And Honda Davit
[4245.52 → 4247.62] And Get and Jeanette
[4247.62 → 4249.42] And Henry and Joyce
[4249.42 → 4250.62] And Jerry and Anne
[4250.62 → 4254.28] And besides that, many of us live alone
[4254.28 → 4257.18] And more or less isolated from family and friends
[4257.18 → 4259.10] Be near them all
[4259.10 → 4263.92] We thank you, Lord, for the recent loosening of visiting rules
[4263.92 → 4266.50] So that we can see some in person again
[4266.50 → 4271.28] But Lord, bring an end to this COVID epidemic
[4271.28 → 4276.16] So much death, suffering, and isolation around the world
[4276.16 → 4280.00] And we all long to be together again in church
[4280.00 → 4281.54] To sing your praise here
[4281.54 → 4283.38] To partake in communion
[4283.38 → 4286.44] To greet each other with a smile and a hug
[4286.44 → 4288.90] Lord, have mercy on this world
[4288.90 → 4293.44] We bring before you
[4293.44 → 4294.88] The needs of this world
[4294.88 → 4298.06] March over the Queen and the Royal Family
[4298.06 → 4299.56] As they mourn Prince Philip
[4299.56 → 4302.54] Be with Prime Minister Trudeau
[4302.54 → 4303.76] And Premier Horgan
[4303.76 → 4305.12] And Mayor Harvey
[4305.12 → 4307.64] They rule at your command
[4307.64 → 4310.32] And we pray that you will also fill them
[4310.32 → 4312.08] With all wisdom and insight
[4312.08 → 4314.04] So that they may rule this justice
[4314.04 → 4318.86] Lord, you know all about war
[4318.86 → 4321.26] And threats of war in various places
[4321.26 → 4323.20] In the Middle East
[4323.20 → 4325.66] In Myanmar, in Ukraine, Afghanistan
[4325.66 → 4330.16] There's unrest and violence in many other places
[4330.16 → 4333.32] Lord, bring peace and equity
[4333.32 → 4336.06] You know about the millions
[4336.06 → 4338.84] Actually tens of millions of refugees
[4338.84 → 4340.82] Scattered in camps around the globe
[4340.82 → 4343.14] Have mercy on them
[4343.14 → 4346.86] And guide us, too, in ways that will release suffering
[4346.86 → 4351.64] Father, all things are in your hands
[4351.64 → 4354.60] Guide us by your Holy Spirit
[4354.60 → 4356.52] Keep us from evil
[4356.52 → 4358.32] And provide for us
[4358.32 → 4361.68] Until we appear before your throne of mercy
[4361.68 → 4365.04] Lord, hear our prayers
[4365.04 → 4367.24] Accept our thanksgiving
[4367.24 → 4369.52] And keep us in your care
[4369.52 → 4372.04] For the sake of Jesus, your Son
[4372.04 → 4373.24] Our Lord
[4373.24 → 4374.54] Amen
[4374.54 → 4393.78] So friends, receive these good words
[4393.78 → 4396.00] The benediction from your God
[4396.00 → 4398.02] I invite you to hold out your hands
[4398.02 → 4400.06] As a gesture of receiving his blessing
[4400.06 → 4403.24] Brothers and sisters
[4403.24 → 4404.52] May the Lord bless you
[4404.52 → 4405.80] And keep you
[4405.80 → 4408.90] May the Lord turn his face toward you
[4408.90 → 4410.64] And be gracious to you
[4410.64 → 4413.52] May he lift his countenance upon you
[4413.52 → 4415.42] And give you his peace
[4415.42 → 4416.24] Amen
[4416.24 → 4416.92] Amen
[4416.92 → 4419.74] Amen
[4419.74 → 4421.88] Amen
[4421.88 → 4423.20] Amen
[4423.20 → 4433.70] Amen
[4433.70 → 4435.84] Amen
[4435.84 → 4438.92] Amen
[4442.86 → 4443.76] Amen
[4443.76 → 4453.32] Day after day we sing your praise
[4453.32 → 4458.96] Forever and forever
[4458.96 → 4466.16] Our generation will come to the next
[4466.16 → 4472.96] Our God is good, and His hand is strong
[4472.96 → 4479.16] Love and God sings his marvellous hands
[4479.16 → 4488.16] And our voice will join in this song
[4488.16 → 4495.16] Praise the Lord in all His ways
[4495.76 → 4501.56] He's waiting to be praised
[4501.56 → 4507.76] Were we to search for mistakes
[4507.76 → 4511.76] His weight is not good
[4511.76 → 4517.76] We've had the one generation
[4517.76 → 4521.76] And all of our lives
[4521.76 → 4527.76] Our God is good, and His hand is strong
[4527.76 → 4533.96] All who all sings his marvellous eyes
[4533.96 → 4537.96] And all voices will join in this song
[4537.96 → 4546.16] And all of our lives
[4546.16 → 4552.36] From the Lord's name
[4552.36 → 4554.36] We sing in every time
[4554.36 → 4558.36] In every place
[4558.36 → 4564.56] We sing in every time
[4564.56 → 4570.76] We sing in every time
[4570.76 → 4572.76] We sing in every time
[4572.76 → 4574.76] We sing in every time
[4574.76 → 4576.96] Every time
[4576.96 → 4580.96] We sing in every time
[4580.96 → 4582.96] We sing in every time
[4582.96 → 4584.96] We sing in every time
[4584.96 → 4586.96] And all of our lives
[4586.96 → 4589.16] We sing in every time
