[314.84 --> 321.12]  Please just sing as you're sitting to prepare your hearts for worship this morning.
[321.12 --> 327.34]  We're going to sing a gathering song, a prayer to ready ourselves for this time of worship.

[329.84 --> 330.84]  Amen.

[345.84 --> 351.84]  Here is this place the new light is streaming.
[351.84 --> 356.84]  Now is the darkness banished away.
[356.84 --> 367.56]  See in this space our fears and our dreamings brought here to you in the light of this day.
[367.56 --> 380.84]  Gather us in the lost and forsaken, gather us in the blind and the lame.
[380.84 --> 391.00]  Call to us now and we shall awaken, we shall arise at the sound of our name.
[391.00 --> 404.00]  We are the young, our lives are a mystery, we are the old who yearn for your face.
[404.00 --> 414.00]  We have been sung throughout all of history, called to be light to the whole human race.
[414.00 --> 426.00]  Gather us in the rich and the haughty, gather us in the proud and the strong.
[426.00 --> 437.00]  Give us the heart so meek and so lowly, give us the courage to enter the song.
[437.00 --> 449.00]  Not in the dark of buildings confining, not in some heaven light years away.
[449.00 --> 460.00]  Here in this place the new light is shining, now is the kingdom and now is the day.
[460.00 --> 472.00]  Gather us in and hold us forever, gather us in and make us your own.
[472.00 --> 483.00]  Gather us in, all peoples together, fire of love in our flesh and our bone.
[483.00 --> 504.00]  Gather us in, all peoples together, fire of love in our hearts.
[504.00 --> 508.00]  There is a wind blowing through this place this morning.
[508.00 --> 513.00]  I might have to hold some things down.
[513.00 --> 514.00]  Welcome.
[514.00 --> 524.00]  Wow, it's nice to be here and see all these faces together this morning on this beautiful, sunny summer day.
[524.00 --> 529.00]  Welcome whether you're here in person or whether you are joining us online today.
[529.00 --> 535.00]  We extend a special welcome to Pastor Bert and Diane.
[535.00 --> 538.00]  I know there they are.
[538.00 --> 541.00]  Coming to us all the way down the valley from Abbotsford today.
[541.00 --> 547.00]  Got back from Ontario last night and had a good sleep I understand.
[547.00 --> 549.00]  So he's raring to go.
[549.00 --> 553.00]  He will be bringing us a message from Psalm 91 a little bit later in the service.
[553.00 --> 556.00]  So thank you very much both of you for being here.
[556.00 --> 563.00]  Our offering today is for Raise Up Global Ministries.
[563.00 --> 575.00]  And by supporting this cause, we are enabling local lay people to be trained Christian leaders in their churches and in their communities and Christian education for kids.
[575.00 --> 578.00]  And this happens all around the globe.
[578.00 --> 584.00]  Lay people trained to be leaders in their communities and their churches.
[584.00 --> 594.00]  So you may drop off a check into the boxes at the back today or you may drop off a check at the church or you can give online.
[594.00 --> 598.00]  And thank you for your generosity in this cause.
[598.00 --> 603.00]  Everyone is invited to remain after the service for a time of fellowship and coffee.
[603.00 --> 607.00]  And that will be in the fellowship hall.
[607.00 --> 609.00]  Okay, in the fellowship hall.
[609.00 --> 611.00]  Just walk straight through back there.
[611.00 --> 613.00]  That's where the coffee will be served today.
[613.00 --> 623.00]  A good time to reacquaint ourselves with each other, what we've been up to in the last year and a half.
[623.00 --> 634.00]  And maybe meet some new faces, maybe some of our new immigrants or some of the people from the Chinese ministry who would like to meet and greet us as well.
[634.00 --> 645.00]  If you are able, would you please rise to hear our words of invitation to worship.
[645.00 --> 652.00]  This is Psalm 63 verses 1 to 4 from the message paraphrase.
[652.00 --> 655.00]  God, you're my God.
[655.00 --> 657.00]  I can't get enough of you.
[657.00 --> 666.00]  I've worked up such hunger and thirst for God traveling across dry and weary deserts.
[666.00 --> 676.00]  So here I am in the place of worship, eyes open, drinking in your strength and glory.
[676.00 --> 681.00]  In your generous love, I am really living at last.
[681.00 --> 686.00]  My lips bring brim praises like fountains.
[686.00 --> 690.00]  I bless you every time I take a breath.
[690.00 --> 694.00]  My arms wave like banners of praise to you.
[694.00 --> 697.00]  Please pray with me.
[697.00 --> 702.00]  God, our God, it's true we have all walked a dry desert.
[702.00 --> 711.00]  It is also true that some of us are hungering and thirsting for you this morning, ready to drink you in, ready to bless you and praise you.
[711.00 --> 717.00]  Others of us are too weak from the wilderness to even notice our hunger or thirst any longer.
[717.00 --> 722.00]  We don't have the energy left to wave our arms like banners to you.
[722.00 --> 729.00]  Great healer, slake our thirst, satisfy even the hunger that we don't recognize.
[729.00 --> 743.00]  Bring us all to your living water and the banquet of your extravagance so that we will become truly alive, able to praise you with all our being and filled with wonder at your greatness.
[743.00 --> 745.00]  Amen.
[745.00 --> 753.00]  People of God, He gathers us and waits for us, extending His arms in welcome.
[753.00 --> 760.00]  He greets us with His grace, mercy and peace through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[760.00 --> 768.00]  And just as God greets us, wave to somebody, yell somebody's name across the way if you want to greet them.
[768.00 --> 775.00]  Just take a few minutes to greet one another and maybe this week think about someone that you might be able to call or visit.
[775.00 --> 776.00]  Thank you.
[805.00 --> 806.00]  Father in heaven how we love you.
[806.00 --> 807.00]  Father in heaven how we love you.
[807.00 --> 819.00]  Father in heaven how we love you.
[819.00 --> 824.00]  We love you.
[824.00 --> 836.00]  Father in heaven, how we love you
[836.00 --> 841.96]  We have lived our land in all the earth
[841.96 --> 848.00]  May your kingdom be established in our praises
[848.00 --> 854.00]  As your people declare your mighty words
[854.64 --> 860.86]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[860.86 --> 867.00]  Who was and is and is to come
[867.68 --> 873.88]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[873.88 --> 880.88]  Who reigns forevermore
[880.88 --> 887.02]  Father of mercy be exalted
[887.02 --> 893.88]  May Jesus' name be lifted high
[893.88 --> 900.88]  For the sacrifice of love has won my pardon
[900.88 --> 906.88]  And His resurrection power gives me life
[906.88 --> 913.88]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[913.88 --> 919.88]  Who was and is and is to come
[919.88 --> 926.88]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[926.88 --> 932.88]  Who reigns forevermore
[932.88 --> 935.88]  Lord God Almighty
[935.88 --> 939.88]  Lord God Almighty
[939.88 --> 949.88]  Alexandre
[949.88 --> 969.50]  Some trust in chariots, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[969.50 --> 975.56]  Some trust in horses, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[975.56 --> 981.40]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[981.80 --> 986.82]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[987.96 --> 994.26]  His love never fails, his name will always prevail.
[994.26 --> 999.46]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1000.52 --> 1003.62]  Some trust in the work they do.
[1003.62 --> 1006.98]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1007.10 --> 1009.88]  By his grace all the work is proved.
[1009.90 --> 1013.14]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1013.40 --> 1017.32]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1017.32 --> 1023.96]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1023.96 --> 1031.84]  His love never fails, his name will always prevail.
[1031.84 --> 1037.32]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1037.32 --> 1049.52]  Oh glory to the name of the Lord our God.
[1049.52 --> 1055.88]  Oh glory to the name of the Lord our God.
[1055.88 --> 1059.36]  His love never fails, his name will always prevail.
[1059.36 --> 1061.36]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1061.36 --> 1064.84]  Some trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1064.84 --> 1068.84]  Some trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1068.84 --> 1072.32]  The name worth more than anything.
[1072.32 --> 1075.38]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1075.38 --> 1079.86]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1079.86 --> 1083.34]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1083.34 --> 1087.34]  We trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[1087.34 --> 1111.54]  You may be seated.
[1117.34 --> 1122.34]  Amen.
[1122.34 --> 1124.84]  As we trust in the name of the Lord.
[1124.84 --> 1128.42]  We also entrust all things to him.
[1129.48 --> 1132.38]  Today we will pray a corporate confession.
[1133.30 --> 1136.82]  Knowing that we have not always been eager to cooperate
[1136.82 --> 1140.94]  with Christ's body in this world.
[1141.50 --> 1143.94]  Please join me in a responsive prayer.
[1143.94 --> 1151.48]  Almighty God, we confess how hard it is to be your people.
[1151.48 --> 1155.04]  You have called us to be the church,
[1155.04 --> 1158.28]  to continue the mission of Jesus Christ
[1158.28 --> 1161.44]  to our lonely and confused world.
[1163.58 --> 1167.80]  Yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active,
[1168.88 --> 1170.58]  isolated than involved,
[1171.60 --> 1173.38]  callous than compassionate,
[1173.94 --> 1176.20]  obstinate than obedient,
[1177.20 --> 1179.26]  legalistic than loving.
[1180.26 --> 1183.36]  Gracious Lord, have mercy upon us
[1183.36 --> 1185.32]  and forgive our sins.
[1191.04 --> 1193.92]  Remove the obstacles preventing us
[1193.92 --> 1197.16]  from being your representatives to a broken world.
[1198.36 --> 1201.12]  Awaken our hearts to the promised gift
[1201.12 --> 1203.38]  of your spirit of your indwelling spirit.
[1203.38 --> 1207.04]  This we pray in Jesus' powerful name.
[1207.76 --> 1208.14]  Amen.
[1210.14 --> 1212.50]  Christ is our peace.
[1213.56 --> 1214.88]  Those who are divided,
[1215.54 --> 1216.52]  he has made one.
[1217.80 --> 1220.78]  He has broken down the barriers of separation
[1220.78 --> 1221.94]  by his death
[1221.94 --> 1223.88]  and has built us up
[1223.88 --> 1226.50]  into one body with God.
[1226.50 --> 1229.68]  To all who repent and believe,
[1230.18 --> 1231.78]  he has promised reconciliation.
[1232.82 --> 1235.78]  So live as people reconciled.
[1235.78 --> 1237.02]  Amen.
[1237.02 --> 1237.22]  Amen.
[1237.22 --> 1238.22]  Amen.
[1238.38 --> 1238.76]  Amen.
[1238.76 --> 1239.16]  Amen.
[1239.16 --> 1239.56]  Amen.
[1239.56 --> 1239.82]  Amen.
[1239.82 --> 1246.50]  Amen.
[1251.60 --> 1252.92]  Amen.
[1252.92 --> 1266.42]  This my only comfort in my life and in my death,
[1266.42 --> 1272.92]  You have fully paid for all my sins and all my debts,
[1273.12 --> 1277.32]  Even when I struggle to believe,
[1277.32 --> 1283.72]  With Your precious blood You set me free.
[1283.72 --> 1295.72]  I am not my own, but belong, body and soul,
[1295.72 --> 1301.72]  In my life and in death,
[1301.72 --> 1310.12]  To You, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1310.12 --> 1316.12]  You preserve my life in such a way that without You,
[1316.12 --> 1322.12]  Not a hair can fall from me unless You will it too.
[1322.12 --> 1352.12] 
[1352.12 --> 1374.52]  I am not my own, but belong,
[1374.52 --> 1380.92]  Always with Your Holy Spirit You assure me
[1380.92 --> 1386.92]  All eternal life and make me willing and ready,
[1386.92 --> 1393.92]  Even when I can see my way through,
[1393.92 --> 1400.52]  From now on to always live for You.
[1400.52 --> 1408.92]  I am not my own, but belong,
[1408.92 --> 1418.52]  Body and soul, in my life and in death,
[1418.52 --> 1426.52]  To You, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1426.52 --> 1434.92]  I am not my own, but belong,
[1434.92 --> 1445.32]  Body and soul, in my life and in death,
[1445.32 --> 1454.52]  To You, Lord, Christ my Lord.
[1454.52 --> 1460.92]  The children are invited at this time,
[1460.92 --> 1462.92]  Ages three to grade four,
[1462.92 --> 1465.92]  To go to kids life.
[1465.92 --> 1471.92]  So we wish you, oh, grade seven,
[1471.92 --> 1474.92]  Sorry, three years old to grade seven.
[1474.92 --> 1476.92]  Sorry I got that wrong.
[1476.92 --> 1480.52]  May you have a good time together.
[1480.52 --> 1498.52]  Father.
[1498.52 --> 1500.92]  Well, good morning everyone.
[1500.92 --> 1502.92]  For the record, we were home by noon yesterday,
[1502.92 --> 1506.32]  So that's why I'm as wide awake as I am.
[1506.32 --> 1509.32]  So don't worry, we're not here half asleep.
[1509.32 --> 1511.32]  So we're good.
[1511.32 --> 1511.72]  We're good.
[1511.72 --> 1514.32]  We were just in Ontario visiting our daughter and five,
[1514.32 --> 1516.32]  Six grandchildren,
[1516.32 --> 1518.32]  whom we hadn't seen of course since two years ago.
[1518.32 --> 1519.32]  Right?
[1519.32 --> 1523.32]  And so good to be in a sanctuary where there are more than
[1523.32 --> 1526.32]  Ten people, I think.
[1526.32 --> 1528.72]  Yeah, it's weird preaching to a camera.
[1528.72 --> 1529.72]  It really is.
[1529.72 --> 1531.72]  And it's so, it's good to be here.
[1531.72 --> 1532.72]  Good to see you all.
[1532.72 --> 1535.72]  And, you know, we're all wondering what's going to happen
[1535.72 --> 1537.72]  when the pandemic is over.
[1537.72 --> 1538.72]  Are people coming back?
[1538.72 --> 1540.72]  And our experience has been,
[1540.72 --> 1543.72]  I'm working in the Maple Ridge for the summer while their
[1543.72 --> 1544.72]  pastors on sabbatical.
[1544.72 --> 1547.72]  But our experience has been that people are eager to get back
[1547.72 --> 1550.72]  together, you know, just to fellowship the community part.
[1550.72 --> 1554.12]  And so I'm not really that worried about the church.
[1554.12 --> 1556.92]  Besides, the church is Jesus' business, not mine.
[1556.92 --> 1558.72]  So he knows what he's doing.
[1558.72 --> 1559.92]  So I don't have to worry about it.
[1559.92 --> 1560.92]  Right?
[1560.92 --> 1564.12]  Anyway, this morning we're going to read from the Psalms.
[1564.12 --> 1567.72]  I'm currently preaching every Sunday and have been since
[1567.72 --> 1571.12]  last November in Smithers who they don't have a pastor.
[1571.12 --> 1573.92]  So I record all these services and send them flash drives.
[1573.92 --> 1576.12]  And anyway, I'm working on a series on the Psalms.
[1576.12 --> 1580.52]  And I know that Jason has been too on the Psalms of the sense.
[1580.52 --> 1585.52]  But anyway, I had actually sent in three different passages
[1585.52 --> 1588.92]  I was going to preach on and I was rebuffed every time.
[1588.92 --> 1590.92]  You can't do that because so and so did it.
[1590.92 --> 1591.92]  Can't do that one.
[1591.92 --> 1592.92]  No, that was done three months ago.
[1592.92 --> 1593.92]  Can't do that.
[1593.92 --> 1594.92]  That was last year.
[1594.92 --> 1598.92]  Anyway, so this is number four on the list.
[1598.92 --> 1601.92]  I'm going to read with you Psalm 91.
[1601.92 --> 1605.92]  Very familiar Psalm, I'm sure to at least some of you,
[1605.92 --> 1606.92]  if not many of you.
[1606.92 --> 1609.92]  Beautiful Psalm and it reads like this.
[1609.92 --> 1617.32]  Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[1617.32 --> 1624.32]  I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[1624.32 --> 1629.92]  Surely He will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.
[1629.92 --> 1634.92]  He will cover you with His feathers and under His wings you will find refuge.
[1634.92 --> 1640.32]  His faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
[1640.32 --> 1642.32]  You will not fear the terror of night,
[1642.32 --> 1645.32]  nor the arrow that flies by day,
[1645.32 --> 1648.32]  nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,
[1648.32 --> 1652.32]  nor the plague that destroys at midday.
[1652.32 --> 1656.32]  A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand,
[1656.32 --> 1659.72]  but it will not come near you.
[1659.72 --> 1666.72]  You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
[1666.72 --> 1667.72]  If you say,
[1667.72 --> 1671.72]  The Lord is my refuge, and you make the Most High your dwelling,
[1671.72 --> 1679.12]  no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent.
[1679.12 --> 1685.12]  For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
[1685.12 --> 1690.12]  They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against the stone.
[1690.12 --> 1693.12]  You will tread on the lion and the cobra.
[1693.12 --> 1698.12]  You will trample the great lion and the serpent.
[1698.12 --> 1703.12]  Because He loves me, says the Lord, I will rescue Him.
[1703.12 --> 1706.12]  I will protect Him, for He acknowledges my name.
[1706.12 --> 1708.72]  He will call on me and I will answer Him.
[1708.72 --> 1710.52]  I will be with Him in trouble.
[1710.52 --> 1712.92]  I will deliver Him and honor Him.
[1712.92 --> 1718.72]  With long life I will satisfy Him and show Him my salvation.
[1718.72 --> 1722.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1722.52 --> 1723.52]  Let's pray together.
[1723.52 --> 1729.32]  Gracious God, we thank you for this beautiful psalm.
[1729.32 --> 1732.32]  And it may be, Lord, that some people are sitting here thinking,
[1732.32 --> 1737.12]  I have some questions about what we just read.
[1737.12 --> 1742.22]  We pray, Lord, that as we look at the psalm part of your word,
[1742.22 --> 1746.22]  that you will help us to understand what it is that you are teaching us,
[1746.22 --> 1748.42]  and that you will help us to hear it,
[1748.42 --> 1754.02]  and as we leave this place to be comforted and encouraged by what we have learned today.
[1754.02 --> 1758.42]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1758.42 --> 1760.52]  So I have a simple question for you this morning.
[1760.52 --> 1766.42]  If you could be any age you wanted,
[1766.42 --> 1768.52]  any age you wanted,
[1768.52 --> 1773.02]  what age would you wish to be?
[1773.02 --> 1781.62]  In an old banner article on Psalm 91,
[1781.62 --> 1786.62]  Dr. Neil Plantinga, who used to be president of Calvin Seminary,
[1786.62 --> 1791.62]  recalls an interview from the old Candid Camera TV show.
[1791.62 --> 1792.62]  Remember that one?
[1792.62 --> 1795.62]  If you do, you're over 65 for sure.
[1795.62 --> 1805.22]  Anyway, it was a show in which this big, tough, tattooed truck driver was asked that question.
[1805.22 --> 1809.22]  Well, there was silence for a while as the man thought about it.
[1809.22 --> 1814.82]  And, you know, it made people wonder, well, was he longing for 65 and retirement
[1814.82 --> 1819.82]  so he could trade in his Kenworth truck for a John Deere riding mower?
[1819.82 --> 1827.82]  Or was he wishing for 18 and the chance to go back and take some road that he had passed by back then?
[1827.82 --> 1838.42]  Well, finally he turned to the interviewer and he said that if it was up to me, I would like to be three.
[1838.42 --> 1842.42]  Well, why three, he was asked.
[1842.42 --> 1851.42]  Because he said, when you are three, you don't have any responsibilities.
[1851.42 --> 1854.02]  He was not trying to be cute.
[1854.02 --> 1863.02]  He was remembering that certain childhood feeling that we tend to lose when we become adults.
[1863.02 --> 1870.02]  He knew that when you are a child and your family is functioning the way it is supposed to,
[1870.02 --> 1875.62]  your burdens are usually very small.
[1875.62 --> 1881.82]  You can go to bed without worrying about sub-zero temperatures freezing the water pipes,
[1881.82 --> 1889.22]  or a wildfire claiming your home and all your possessions forcing you to evacuate.
[1889.22 --> 1898.02]  You don't have to wonder if that tingling feeling in your leg might be a symptom of some horrible nerve disease.
[1898.02 --> 1902.22]  You don't struggle half the night with a tax deduction you claimed,
[1902.22 --> 1908.82]  wondering whether Revenue Canada might find it a little too creative.
[1908.82 --> 1918.82]  No, you wriggle warmly in your bed with the white noise of adult conversation elsewhere in the house as background music,
[1918.82 --> 1923.82]  and you let go and you fall asleep.
[1923.82 --> 1931.22]  And you dare to do it because you are sleeping under the wings of your parents.
[1931.22 --> 1938.82]  If parents take proper care of you, you can give yourself up to sleep secure in the knowledge that somebody else,
[1938.82 --> 1943.82]  somebody big and strong and experienced is in charge.
[1943.82 --> 1949.82]  As far as many children know at age three, I think, parents stay up all night long, don't they?
[1949.82 --> 1957.62]  Checking doors and windows regularly, adjusting temperature controls, fearlessly driving away any and all robbers.
[1957.62 --> 1960.22]  They never go off duty.
[1960.22 --> 1963.22]  They neither slumber nor sleep.
[1963.22 --> 1970.22]  If a shadow falls over the house, demons begin to stir them, a big storm rises up.
[1970.22 --> 1974.22]  Mom and dad will handle it.
[1974.22 --> 1981.22]  Which is one reason why most children in general sleep so deep and so well.
[1981.22 --> 1988.82]  Their nest is sheltered and feathered.
[1988.82 --> 1997.82]  How alarmed our children might be if they knew just how much we as adults crave that same sense of security, right?
[1997.82 --> 1998.82]  Isn't that true?
[1998.82 --> 2005.82]  As adults, we also need to be embraced and sheltered and warned.
[2005.82 --> 2010.42]  Some of us have been betrayed.
[2010.42 --> 2015.42]  Some of us have grown old and are not very happy about it.
[2015.42 --> 2022.42]  Some of us are deeply disappointed that our lives have not turned out as we had hoped.
[2022.42 --> 2029.42]  Others have been shocked by a report that just came back from a pathology lab.
[2029.42 --> 2035.02]  Others have been painfully ignored by people we treasure.
[2035.02 --> 2040.02]  Some of us are just high tension and stressed people.
[2040.02 --> 2047.62]  To all such people, Psalm 91 speaks a word of comfort.
[2047.62 --> 2053.62]  Echoing one of the Bible's great themes, God is our shelter.
[2053.62 --> 2064.62]  The psalmist says, He will cover you with His feathers and under His wings you will find refuge.
[2064.62 --> 2075.22]  The image here is that of a mother hen who senses danger and then protectively spreads its wings over her young.
[2075.22 --> 2082.22]  Any expert on birds will tell you that this move is a very common one.
[2082.22 --> 2094.82]  A bird senses the approach of a predator or the threat of something falling from above and instinctively spreads out its wings like a canopy.
[2094.82 --> 2099.82]  Then the baby birds scurry underneath for shelter.
[2099.82 --> 2109.82]  For an adult bird, the move is so deeply instinctive that it will spread its wings even when none of its chicks are around.
[2109.82 --> 2116.42]  And the psalmist who has seen this very thing happen thinks about God.
[2116.42 --> 2124.42]  He will cover you with His feathers and under His wings you will find refuge.
[2124.42 --> 2127.42]  God is our shelter when the storms begin to rise.
[2127.42 --> 2132.42]  Under God's care we are defended, protected and safe.
[2132.42 --> 2139.02]  God who never goes off duty, who neither slumbers nor sleeps is in charge.
[2139.02 --> 2145.02]  And who is bigger, stronger and more experienced than Him.
[2145.02 --> 2160.02]  Just before Herbert Vissers, a former member of my last congregation died in the late 1990's, he told me this story that happened during World War II.
[2160.02 --> 2166.62]  When the Vissers family still lived in the Netherlands and were occupied by Nazi Germany.
[2166.62 --> 2179.62]  One by one, he told me, with no one receiving advance warning, the Nazis were forcibly removing all eligible men of their town to work in labor camps throughout Europe.
[2179.62 --> 2186.22]  One night, as the Vissers family was having dinner, the whole family gathered around the table.
[2186.22 --> 2192.22]  Soldiers knocked on the door and Mr. Vissers was ordered to come with them immediately.
[2192.22 --> 2210.82]  Assuring them that he would come without resistance, he asked them in a gentle voice, because he was a gentle man, for permission to have devotions with his wife and his children one more time.
[2210.82 --> 2213.82]  They agreed.
[2213.82 --> 2228.82]  And as the family sat around the table, the soldiers standing around them, Mr. Vissers took out the family Bible and he read Psalm 91.
[2228.82 --> 2232.82]  Then he prayed and he concluded with these words,
[2232.82 --> 2239.82]  Oh God, in the shadow of your wings, we take refuge.
[2239.82 --> 2242.82]  And what refuge?
[2242.82 --> 2251.82]  For when Mr. Vissers died in July of 1998, he was just two days shy of his 93rd birthday.
[2251.82 --> 2258.82]  God spread his wings over him, spreads his wings over us.
[2258.82 --> 2262.82]  He spreads his wings over our children.
[2262.82 --> 2265.82]  Every baptism signifies and seals it.
[2265.82 --> 2273.82]  Here is a picture that generations of believers have loved.
[2273.82 --> 2281.82]  In part because it invites us to recover our childhood feeling of security in the nest.
[2281.82 --> 2288.82]  Or if we have had a painful or abusive childhood, to discover it for the very first time.
[2288.82 --> 2296.82]  It is a picture that offers such wonderful comfort, you would have to be a pretty numb Christian not to be touched by it.
[2296.82 --> 2310.82]  But, but, there is a troubling, disturbing question that nags here, isn't there?
[2310.82 --> 2315.82]  Just how true is this picture of a sheltering God?
[2315.82 --> 2322.82]  Just how secure, really, are we in the nest?
[2322.82 --> 2327.82]  I wonder whether the same night, well, I know, I think.
[2327.82 --> 2336.82]  The same night that Mr. Vissers prayed, some other Dutch farmer in another town begged God to spread his wings over him and his family.
[2336.82 --> 2345.82]  Except that sometime during the next several years, a Nazi bullet pierced those wings and a family waited in vain for their father's return.
[2345.82 --> 2352.82]  You read Psalm 91 and you cannot help but wonder, can you?
[2352.82 --> 2355.82]  It offers such comprehensive coverage.
[2355.82 --> 2360.82]  He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge.
[2360.82 --> 2369.82]  You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.
[2369.82 --> 2370.82]  Really?
[2370.82 --> 2371.82]  Really?
[2371.82 --> 2375.82]  I need not fear any of these things?
[2375.82 --> 2384.82]  I can sleep in any neighborhood in my town or my city with my windows wide open and my doors unlocked and I shall not fear the terror of night?
[2384.82 --> 2391.82]  My child's temperature soars and her blood count plunges and I shall not fear the pestilence that stalks in the darkness?
[2391.82 --> 2403.82]  I volunteer for work at an AIDS clinic or I go to my regular job at Savon this past year and a half and I shall not fear the plague that wastes at midday?
[2403.82 --> 2410.82]  I shall not fear the arrow, the suicide bomber, the IED that flies by day?
[2410.82 --> 2416.82]  Could a believer say this in Baghdad or Kandahar or Kabul or in Damascus?
[2416.82 --> 2430.82]  Even after you've made some allowances for poetic exaggeration, is there a level of faith that can honestly claim such things no matter the circumstances?
[2430.82 --> 2435.82]  Let's be honest.
[2435.82 --> 2445.82]  Faith in God's sheltering wings doesn't remove physical danger or the need for precaution against it.
[2445.82 --> 2450.82]  We cannot ignore tourist advisories when it comes to visiting Mexican border towns.
[2450.82 --> 2454.82]  Don't feed the bears on your camping trip.
[2454.82 --> 2460.82]  Don't jump a hot motorbike over a row of parked cars and trust God to keep you safe.
[2460.82 --> 2466.82]  You cannot smoke cigarettes like the Marlboro Man or salute Captain Morgan as the captain of your soul
[2466.82 --> 2474.82]  and then claim the promises of Psalm 91 for protection against lung cancer or liver disease.
[2474.82 --> 2481.82]  A person who did these things would be a foolish believer and a very foolish reader of Psalm 91.
[2481.82 --> 2493.82]  In Matthew's Gospel, you remember, Satan attempts Jesus to prove who he is by jumping from the highest point of the temple and the devil quotes this song.
[2493.82 --> 2498.82]  If you are the son of God, he said, throw yourself down for it is written.
[2498.82 --> 2506.82]  He will command his angels concerning you and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against the stone.
[2506.82 --> 2512.82]  And Jesus replies, it's not good to put God to the test.
[2512.82 --> 2513.82]  It's not right.
[2513.82 --> 2518.82]  His protection is good for many things, but certain restrictions apply.
[2518.82 --> 2523.82]  You cannot act foolishly or recklessly and then count on God to bail you out.
[2523.82 --> 2524.82]  Now, God may do so.
[2524.82 --> 2527.82]  I suspect most of us can recall such times in our lives.
[2527.82 --> 2533.82]  I know I can, but you may not count on it.
[2533.82 --> 2540.82]  Most of us know, however, that some believers get hurt badly, hurt by no folly of their own.
[2540.82 --> 2546.82]  Suppose some crazy driver driving 150 kilometers an hour smashes into the rear of your family minivan,
[2546.82 --> 2549.82]  or a mudslide hits the highway just as you're passing by,
[2549.82 --> 2555.82]  or a human predator snatches your daughter never to be found alive.
[2555.82 --> 2561.82]  Or suppose you are a faithful Christian man approaching middle age and one day you start to feel a little sick.
[2561.82 --> 2566.82]  You visit your doctor who sends you for tests and then to a specialist, then more tests,
[2566.82 --> 2572.82]  and finally your family doctor sits you down and says, I'm sorry, you need to get your affairs in order.
[2572.82 --> 2578.82]  She says a whole lot more about treatments and research and making you as comfortable as possible.
[2578.82 --> 2581.82]  All of it well meant, but you have grown deaf.
[2581.82 --> 2586.82]  All you can think of is that you're 40 years old and you're going to die before your parents do,
[2586.82 --> 2592.82]  before your kids get married and you will never know the joy and fun of being a grandfather.
[2592.82 --> 2598.82]  Whatever happened to the wings of God then?
[2598.82 --> 2603.82]  Can you get brain cancer under those wings?
[2603.82 --> 2605.82]  Or leukemia?
[2605.82 --> 2608.82]  Or cystic fibrosis?
[2608.82 --> 2610.82]  Or COVID-19?
[2610.82 --> 2613.82]  Can you get sexually abused by a family member?
[2613.82 --> 2618.82]  Can you get shot by some indifferent gangster because you are in the right place?
[2618.82 --> 2619.82]  Oh yeah.
[2619.82 --> 2621.82]  At the wrong time.
[2621.82 --> 2626.82]  Can you find suddenly one summer that your own 17-year-old daughter has become a stranger
[2626.82 --> 2629.82]  and that everything in your family seems to be going out of control?
[2629.82 --> 2634.82]  Where are those everlasting wings then?
[2634.82 --> 2646.82]  And you know, it's not the simple fact that believers suffer along with everybody else that troubles us so much, is it?
[2646.82 --> 2654.82]  C.S. Lewis, thinking about this whole subject, once suggested that if the children of God were always saved from floods,
[2654.82 --> 2664.82]  like believing Noah and his family, if every time somebody pointed a gun at a Christian the gun turned to salami and bent over,
[2664.82 --> 2672.82]  if we really had a money back guarantee against hatred, against disease, against terrorist acts, you name it,
[2672.82 --> 2676.82]  we'd never have to worry about church growth.
[2676.82 --> 2683.82]  Churches would fill with people attracted to the faith, but for what reasons?
[2683.82 --> 2687.82]  Because they want a five-star general.
[2687.82 --> 2693.82]  They want an insurance agent, not necessarily God.
[2693.82 --> 2698.82]  And where is the integrity in such faith?
[2698.82 --> 2709.82]  If becoming a believer really did give you blanket protection against poverty, against accident, and all the wages of sin.
[2709.82 --> 2722.82]  Remember, this was Satan's question to God, as together they observed the righteousness of Job.
[2722.82 --> 2724.82]  But no.
[2724.82 --> 2730.82]  It is not the fact that we have to take our share of the world's suffering that surprises us.
[2730.82 --> 2735.82]  After all, our experience and the Bible itself have taught us to expect hardship.
[2735.82 --> 2743.82]  What is troubling in Psalm 91, on first reading, is that it tells us there's no reason to worry.
[2743.82 --> 2744.82]  Listen again.
[2744.82 --> 2751.82]  A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
[2751.82 --> 2755.82]  Man, that's advertising that sounds too good to be true.
[2755.82 --> 2759.82]  In fact, says the psalmist, if you make the Lord your refuge, listen to this,
[2759.82 --> 2765.82]  no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent.
[2765.82 --> 2766.82]  Really.
[2766.82 --> 2772.82]  What about the apostle Paul?
[2772.82 --> 2775.82]  What about Stephen, the first Christian martyr?
[2775.82 --> 2780.82]  What about the disciple James, put to death by the sword by order of King Herod?
[2780.82 --> 2787.82]  What about Peter, crucified upside down for the entertainment of Emperor Nero?
[2787.82 --> 2792.82]  What about the Lord Jesus himself, who wept over Jerusalem, who cried out,
[2792.82 --> 2799.82]  how often I have longed to gather your children together, as the hen gathers her chicks under her wings.
[2799.82 --> 2802.82]  But you were not willing.
[2802.82 --> 2808.82]  No, what they wanted and what they did instead was they took him outside of town one Friday
[2808.82 --> 2812.82]  and they nailed his wings to a couple of four by fours.
[2812.82 --> 2819.82]  So what is going on in Psalm 91?
[2819.82 --> 2827.82]  How can its extravagant promises possibly be God's word to us?
[2827.82 --> 2833.82]  Well, you see, this is what Psalm 91 does.
[2833.82 --> 2836.82]  It expresses one.
[2836.82 --> 2842.82]  One of the most beautiful and treasured, but just one of the moods of faith.
[2842.82 --> 2854.82]  It is a mood of exuberant confidence in the sheltering providence of God that we have all experienced at one time or another.
[2854.82 --> 2861.82]  While we are not given the specific details, it is obvious the psalmist has been protected by God in some dangerous incident,
[2861.82 --> 2865.82]  and now he is celebrating.
[2865.82 --> 2871.82]  On other days, in other moods, in other and darker seasons of his life,
[2871.82 --> 2877.82]  this same psalmist might have called out to God out of despair and a sense of abandonment.
[2877.82 --> 2881.82]  You remember after all, right?
[2881.82 --> 2886.82]  That when our Lord Jesus was crucified, when he cried out to heaven,
[2886.82 --> 2889.82]  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[2889.82 --> 2894.82]  When Jesus shouted this out in astonishment, maybe even with a note of accusation,
[2894.82 --> 2898.82]  remember he was quoting another psalm.
[2898.82 --> 2900.82]  Psalm 22.
[2900.82 --> 2906.82]  Despair or astonishment at what can happen to us under God's providence,
[2906.82 --> 2909.82]  that too is natural.
[2909.82 --> 2912.82]  That too is biblical.
[2912.82 --> 2917.82]  Psalm 91 gives us only a part of the picture,
[2917.82 --> 2919.82]  and only one of the moods of faith.
[2919.82 --> 2926.82]  With a kind of quiet amazement, the psalmist bears witness that under the wings of God,
[2926.82 --> 2931.82]  good things happen to bad people.
[2931.82 --> 2935.82]  You need another psalm or two to fill in the whole picture,
[2935.82 --> 2942.82]  to cry out that under those same wings, bad things sometimes happen to good people.
[2942.82 --> 2945.82]  Psalm 91 says,
[2945.82 --> 2950.82]  No harm or evil shall befall us.
[2950.82 --> 2954.82]  When we have stripped away some of the poetic license,
[2954.82 --> 2958.82]  and then added in the witness of the rest of the Bible,
[2958.82 --> 2963.82]  the one certain conclusion you get is this.
[2963.82 --> 2970.82]  No final evil shall befall you.
[2970.82 --> 2975.82]  We know that we can believe in God with all of our heart,
[2975.82 --> 2979.82]  and yet have our heart broken by the loss of a child,
[2979.82 --> 2982.82]  or the betrayal of a spouse,
[2982.82 --> 2985.82]  or the menace of a fatal disease.
[2985.82 --> 2988.82]  All of us know this is true.
[2988.82 --> 2995.82]  And yet generation after generation of bruised saints have known something else,
[2995.82 --> 2999.82]  and spoken of it as well.
[2999.82 --> 3005.82]  In the mystery of faith, we find a hand on us in the darkness,
[3005.82 --> 3008.82]  a voice that calls our name,
[3008.82 --> 3014.82]  and the deep certainty that nothing can ever separate us from the love of God,
[3014.82 --> 3020.82]  not in this life, nor in the life to come.
[3020.82 --> 3024.82]  We may be scarred, we may be shaken,
[3024.82 --> 3026.82]  but in the words of Lewis Smeeds,
[3026.82 --> 3029.82]  we come to know that it's all right,
[3029.82 --> 3033.82]  even when everything is all wrong.
[3033.82 --> 3041.82]  We are like baby chicks who scurry under the wings of their parent.
[3041.82 --> 3044.82]  The forces of evil, merciless and cruel,
[3044.82 --> 3046.82]  beat on those wings with everything they have.
[3046.82 --> 3049.82]  When the evil one is finished, when evil had done its worst,
[3049.82 --> 3054.82]  those wings are all bloodied and broken and hanging at all kinds of crazy angles.
[3054.82 --> 3062.82]  But we are all right because those wings have never folded.
[3062.82 --> 3066.82]  They are spread out to be wounded for our transgressions,
[3066.82 --> 3069.82]  bruised for our iniquities.
[3069.82 --> 3072.82]  And when the feathers quit flying,
[3072.82 --> 3075.82]  we peep out and we discover
[3075.82 --> 3080.82]  that we have been in the only place that was not leveled.
[3080.82 --> 3083.82]  Yes, we have been bumped, we have been bruised,
[3083.82 --> 3087.82]  we have been hurt sometimes so badly.
[3087.82 --> 3093.82]  But the other option was to break out of God's embrace in Christ Jesus,
[3093.82 --> 3097.82]  our only comfort in life and death.
[3097.82 --> 3099.82]  If we had not stayed under those wings,
[3099.82 --> 3104.82]  we would never, never have felt the body shudders,
[3104.82 --> 3109.82]  nor heard the groans of the one who loved us so much
[3109.82 --> 3116.82]  that those wings stayed out there no matter what devilish arrows came flying in.
[3116.82 --> 3122.82]  This is the one who protects us from final evil,
[3122.82 --> 3125.82]  now and in the life to come,
[3125.82 --> 3134.82]  the life in which at last it will be safe for God to fold His wings.
[3134.82 --> 3138.82]  And so we sing in the words of songwriter Chris Tomlin,
[3138.82 --> 3140.82]  a song that maybe you know,
[3140.82 --> 3142.82]  Whom shall I fear?
[3142.82 --> 3145.82]  I know who goes before me.
[3145.82 --> 3147.82]  I know who stands behind.
[3147.82 --> 3153.82]  The God of angel armies is always by my side.
[3153.82 --> 3156.82]  Again, in the words of the psalmist,
[3156.82 --> 3159.82]  He will cover you with His feathers,
[3159.82 --> 3165.82]  and under His wings you will find refuge.
[3165.82 --> 3168.82]  It is not a simple truth,
[3168.82 --> 3170.82]  but it is the truth,
[3170.82 --> 3175.82]  a truth confirmed in our baptisms.
[3175.82 --> 3181.82]  May each of us always believe it with everything that is in us.
[3181.82 --> 3185.82]  In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[3185.82 --> 3186.82]  Let's pray.
[3186.82 --> 3190.82]  Gracious God, we thank you for this song.
[3193.82 --> 3199.82]  We thank you Lord for its reminder of the words we sang just a little while ago
[3200.82 --> 3203.82]  about our only comfort in life and in death,
[3203.82 --> 3205.82]  that we belong to you.
[3205.82 --> 3207.82]  And so we know,
[3207.82 --> 3210.82]  no final harm, no final evil,
[3210.82 --> 3213.82]  will ever get the better of us.
[3213.82 --> 3217.82]  We are safe, we are protected for now forever,
[3217.82 --> 3219.82]  under your wings,
[3219.82 --> 3223.82]  because of what Christ has suffered for us.
[3224.82 --> 3225.82]  Thank you.
[3225.82 --> 3227.82]  In Jesus name.
[3227.82 --> 3228.82]  Amen.
[3228.82 --> 3243.82]  I used to sing our song of response.
[3243.82 --> 3254.82]  We won't fear the battle,
[3254.82 --> 3256.82]  we won't fear the night,
[3256.82 --> 3261.82]  we will walk the valley with you by our side.
[3261.82 --> 3264.82]  You will go before us,
[3264.82 --> 3266.82]  you will lead the way.
[3266.82 --> 3269.82]  We have found a refuge,
[3269.82 --> 3272.82]  only you can sing.
[3272.82 --> 3275.82]  Sing with joy now,
[3275.82 --> 3278.82]  our God is for us.
[3278.82 --> 3282.82]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[3282.82 --> 3285.82]  Raise your voice now,
[3285.82 --> 3287.82]  no love is greater.
[3287.82 --> 3293.82]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3293.82 --> 3305.82]  Even when I stumble,
[3305.82 --> 3307.82]  even when I fall,
[3307.82 --> 3310.82]  even when I turn back,
[3310.82 --> 3312.82]  still your love is sure.
[3312.82 --> 3314.82]  You will not abandon,
[3314.82 --> 3317.82]  you will not forsake,
[3317.82 --> 3319.82]  you will cheer me on,
[3319.82 --> 3323.82]  you will not wander with never-ending grace.
[3323.82 --> 3326.82]  Sing with joy now,
[3326.82 --> 3328.82]  our God is for us.
[3328.82 --> 3333.82]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[3333.82 --> 3335.82]  Raise your voice now,
[3335.82 --> 3338.82]  no love is greater.
[3338.82 --> 3344.82]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3344.82 --> 3357.82]  Neither heart nor death can separate us.
[3357.82 --> 3362.82]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[3362.82 --> 3367.82]  He who gave his Son to free us
[3367.82 --> 3371.82]  holds me in his love.
[3371.82 --> 3395.82]  Sing with joy now,
[3395.82 --> 3398.82]  our God is for us.
[3398.82 --> 3403.82]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[3403.82 --> 3405.82]  Raise your voice now,
[3405.82 --> 3407.82]  no love is greater.
[3407.82 --> 3412.82]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3412.82 --> 3414.82]  Sing with joy now,
[3414.82 --> 3417.82]  our God is for us.
[3417.82 --> 3421.82]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[3421.82 --> 3424.82]  Raise your voice now,
[3424.82 --> 3426.82]  no love is greater.
[3426.82 --> 3431.82]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3431.82 --> 3445.82]  You may be seated.
[3445.82 --> 3447.82]  We are asking you first...
[3447.82 --> 3448.82]  Lord questions.
[3448.82 --> 3449.82]  You may be seated.
[3449.82 --> 3451.82]  Could you please follow us if we are here at church?
[3451.82 --> 3452.82]  And please Jacob?
[3452.82 --> 3461.48]  Because the Father's love and diesen
[3461.48 --> 3465.82]  Sally are asking from the First Lady as we wake up of your in the day.
[3465.82 --> 3467.32]  So, do you want to go out and generalize this evening for our community?
[3467.32 --> 3471.94]  As we come to God in prayer this morning, there is one announcement.
[3472.86 --> 3483.58]  Hannah, our children's ministry director, got news last week that her brother in China passed away.
[3484.36 --> 3492.86]  And so we pray for comfort for both Hannah and her mother, Linda, who is also in our Chinese ministry group.
[3492.86 --> 3500.24]  So also we will remember Jerry and Anne.
[3500.40 --> 3507.10]  Anne has been moved to Peace Portal Seniors Village as Jerry continues his journey of recovery as well.
[3510.00 --> 3511.18]  Let's pray together.
[3511.18 --> 3523.90]  Eternal God, Father, Son, and Spirit, our Creator, our Lover, our Everything,
[3524.84 --> 3528.80]  we have come to bring our best worship and praise to you this morning.
[3529.26 --> 3532.88]  And even though it's far from perfect, we know you delight in it,
[3533.22 --> 3537.70]  as we often delight in the imperfect gift of a child given from the heart.
[3537.70 --> 3545.30]  We acknowledge you as the author and giver of all good, true and beautiful in our world.
[3546.44 --> 3551.76]  More than that, you invite us to come to you with the fragments of our lives.
[3552.54 --> 3556.18]  We lean into your compassion on so many levels.
[3556.18 --> 3564.62]  Thank you for the word this morning that allows us to come to you and to understand
[3564.62 --> 3569.34]  that even in the darkest times, you cover us with your wings.
[3570.62 --> 3579.16]  We bring you our world injured by racial tension, disease, environmental and climatic disaster,
[3579.74 --> 3582.04]  and resurfacing painful history.
[3582.04 --> 3590.86]  Almighty, all-knowing God, we lay before you these cares and give you thanks for those who work to alleviate their effects.
[3591.78 --> 3597.84]  Bless the peacemakers and justice workers who strain towards equality of race and gender.
[3598.96 --> 3604.96]  May we recognize our own biases and learn to adopt a Christ-like perspective on humanity.
[3604.96 --> 3611.04]  Sustain medical researchers and administrators, physicians and frontline workers,
[3611.18 --> 3613.10]  especially those in the nursing profession,
[3613.58 --> 3617.68]  whose efforts to stem the tide of this global pandemic seem endless.
[3618.56 --> 3622.40]  May others rise up to help or step in where rest is needed.
[3624.00 --> 3628.32]  Keep firefighters safe, Lord, as they work so hard to protect lives and property.
[3629.12 --> 3632.48]  We ask for rain to help end the fires that rage out of control.
[3632.48 --> 3637.26]  We ask for generous provision and care for those who have lost homes and goods.
[3638.78 --> 3642.10]  We also remember those affected by the floods in Europe, and again,
[3642.38 --> 3645.38]  we pray for an end to loss of life in that disaster,
[3645.62 --> 3650.46]  and comfort for those who have lost loved ones, homes or livelihood because of it.
[3651.42 --> 3656.14]  May your kingdom be evident everywhere through those who bring your love in various ways.
[3656.14 --> 3664.22]  Across this nation, there is deep division because of the harm done during the residential school era not so very long ago.
[3665.12 --> 3669.70]  May the ongoing work of reconciliation be carried out with sensitivity and compassion,
[3670.18 --> 3673.14]  with love laying the foundation beneath it all.
[3673.92 --> 3681.18]  Give us understanding hearts and wisdom to engage in conversations and actions of justice, mercy, and wholeness.
[3681.18 --> 3685.16]  We give you thanks for Raise Up Global Ministries,
[3685.60 --> 3689.92]  training leaders in educational and spiritual leadership so that your kingdom can flourish.
[3690.86 --> 3694.96]  Guide those who develop the training material as well as the trainers and students.
[3695.82 --> 3699.30]  Thank you for the opportunity to be involved in supporting this vital ministry.
[3700.46 --> 3705.16]  In this, we desire to respond to your extravagant grace in our lives.
[3705.16 --> 3711.86]  Loving God, you know and see the pain that lives in this church community.
[3713.00 --> 3718.04]  Be near those who are undergoing treatment for various physical ailments.
[3719.14 --> 3722.46]  Extend your hand of healing through these treatments, we pray.
[3723.44 --> 3727.20]  We also ask for your grace as Dawn goes through another eye surgery tomorrow.
[3727.96 --> 3730.00]  May all go well with no complications.
[3730.56 --> 3734.18]  And in boldness, we ask for full restoration of sight.
[3735.16 --> 3739.74]  Great physician, there are those who are engaged in emotional and spiritual battles.
[3740.54 --> 3742.36]  You know our minds and our hearts.
[3743.30 --> 3746.24]  Jesus, you offer peace that passes all understanding.
[3746.94 --> 3748.14]  This is our prayer for them.
[3749.26 --> 3751.12]  We remember Jerry and Anne.
[3751.34 --> 3753.86]  May they encounter your peace as they are apart.
[3754.70 --> 3759.90]  We pray that Anne may settle well into her new home where she can receive the full care she requires.
[3759.90 --> 3764.54]  Continue to care for Jerry as he convalesces from his stroke.
[3765.08 --> 3772.26]  And for both of them in their separation, which is surely painful after so many years together.
[3773.84 --> 3778.12]  Lord, you have made us for community and communion with you and with each other.
[3778.12 --> 3782.28]  We bring before you those who suffer broken relationships.
[3783.14 --> 3786.06]  That, too, can be a long journey toward healing.
[3786.88 --> 3792.32]  Bring redemption and reconciliation through your Holy Spirit, whatever that may look like.
[3792.32 --> 3801.24]  Finally, God of all consolation, we lay before you Linda and Hannah who are grieving the loss of their son and brother in China.
[3801.88 --> 3807.34]  We pray that you will comfort them there as well as Yangong's family overseas.
[3808.20 --> 3812.08]  Being so far away from each other adds extra complexity to their grief.
[3812.86 --> 3816.20]  May they all experience your loving presence in the days to come.
[3816.20 --> 3821.84]  For all in our midst who grieve losses of loved ones, we ask that you would carry them daily.
[3822.52 --> 3824.90]  Sometimes it feels like such a long journey.
[3826.26 --> 3829.42]  O God who knows our sorrows and suffers with us,
[3829.70 --> 3835.38]  we long for the day when you will gather up all our fragments into something beautiful and make all things new.
[3836.10 --> 3844.80]  As we abide in the now and not yet, give us eyes to see what is good, pure, lovely, honorable, and worthy of praise.
[3844.80 --> 3852.36]  Give us hearts that believe you are able to do far more than anything we can ask or even imagine.
[3853.16 --> 3859.36]  We pray all this in your name, Jesus, the name higher than any other name ever was or ever will be.
[3859.92 --> 3860.26]  Amen.
[3869.08 --> 3872.70]  Please rise for God's parting blessing and then our closing song.
[3874.80 --> 3881.32]  As we leave this place and enter another week, God blesses us with these words.
[3881.42 --> 3884.50]  The embrace of the Father be the comfort you desire.
[3885.40 --> 3888.24]  The name of the Son be the one on whom you rely.
[3889.12 --> 3892.06]  The presence of the Holy Spirit be with you every hour.
[3892.96 --> 3895.80]  The three in one be the focus of all you are.
[3895.80 --> 3902.00]  And the blessing of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit rest upon you now and always.
[3902.28 --> 3904.28]  And all God's people say, Amen.
[3904.80 --> 3922.32]  Your peace within us, Lord, will stand.
[3923.32 --> 3927.56]  Surpassing all we understand.
[3927.56 --> 3937.78]  Even when peace surround our land, you fill our lives with peace.
[3937.78 --> 3948.60]  Salam, salam, the peace of God to every race.
[3948.60 --> 3960.78]  Salam, salam, salam, the peace of God in every place.
[3960.78 --> 3975.78]  When walking we are led astray.
[3975.78 --> 3976.78]  Your spirit, your spirit in us, Lord, will stand.
[3976.78 --> 3977.78]  Your spirit in us, Lord, will stand.
[3977.78 --> 3978.78]  Your spirit in us, Lord, will stand.
[3978.78 --> 3980.78]  You fill our lives with peace.
[3980.78 --> 3990.78]  You fill our lives with peace.
[3990.78 --> 4002.50]  Salam, salam, salam, salam, the peace of God in every race.
[4002.50 --> 4014.46]  Salam, salam, salam, the peace of God in every race.
[4014.46 --> 4015.46]  God's peace.
[4015.46 --> 4029.68]  God's peace you offer us to live.
[4029.68 --> 4034.68]  A peace the world can never give.
[4034.68 --> 4035.68]  A peace the world can never give.
[4035.68 --> 4044.68]  And while your spirit in us, let you fill our lives with peace.
[4044.68 --> 4067.68]  Salam, salam, salam, the peace of God in every race.
[4067.68 --> 4083.68]  A peace of God in every race.
[4083.68 --> 4087.68]  God's peace.
[4087.68 --> 4091.18]  Amen?
[4091.18 --> 4094.68]  Amen?
[4094.68 --> 4124.66]  Thank you.
[4124.68 --> 4154.66]  Thank you.
[4154.68 --> 4184.66]  Thank you.
