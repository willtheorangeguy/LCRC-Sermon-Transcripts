[944.60 → 949.60] Round him the Lord of life,
[949.60 → 953.60] behold his hands and side.
[953.60 → 957.60] Rich wounds, death is above,
[957.60 → 961.60] in beauty glorified.
[961.60 → 966.60] No angels in the sky,
[966.60 → 970.60] can fully bear that sight.
[970.60 → 974.60] But down would bend their burning eyes,
[974.60 → 980.60] act mystery so bright.
[980.60 → 989.60] Let's pray.
[989.60 → 994.60] Please join in this responsive reading as we do so.
[994.60 → 999.60] Almighty God, you have raised Jesus from death to life,
[999.60 → 1001.60] and crowned him Lord of all.
[1001.60 → 1004.60] We confess that we have not bowed before him,
[1004.60 → 1007.60] or acknowledged his rule in our lives.
[1007.60 → 1010.60] We have gone along with the ways of the world,
[1010.60 → 1013.60] and failed to give him glory.
[1013.60 → 1016.60] Forgive us, and raise us from sin,
[1016.60 → 1019.60] that we may be your faithful people,
[1019.60 → 1022.60] obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1022.60 → 1024.60] who rules the world,
[1024.60 → 1027.60] and is head of the church, his body.
[1027.60 → 1028.60] Amen.
[1037.60 → 1048.60] There's a wideness in God's mercy,
[1048.60 → 1053.60] like the wideness of the sea.
[1053.60 → 1058.60] There's a kindness in God's justice,
[1058.60 → 1062.60] which is more than liberty.
[1062.60 → 1066.60] There is no place where our sorrows
[1066.60 → 1071.60] are more felt than our beheld.
[1071.60 → 1075.60] There is no place where our feelings
[1075.60 → 1081.60] have such kindly judgment given.
[1081.60 → 1092.60] For the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind,
[1092.60 → 1100.60] and the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind.
[1100.60 → 1105.60] Make our love, O God, more faithful,
[1105.60 → 1110.60] let us take you at your word,
[1110.60 → 1114.60] and our lives will be thanksgiving
[1114.60 → 1120.60] for the goodness of the Lord.
[1120.60 → 1131.60] In the Bible, in Ephesians 2,
[1131.60 → 1135.60] we are told that because we are joined with Christ,
[1135.60 → 1139.60] God forgives us, raises us from the dead,
[1139.60 → 1143.60] and seats us with Christ in the heavenly realms.
[1143.60 → 1148.60] The world sees us as examples of God's incredible love and grace,
[1148.60 → 1152.60] shown in all he's done for us in Jesus.
[1152.60 → 1155.60] We are God's masterpiece.
[1155.60 → 1158.60] None of us can boast about our own goodness.
[1158.60 → 1160.60] It's all God's doing.
[1160.60 → 1163.60] He has renewed us in Jesus,
[1163.60 → 1165.60] so we can do the good things he planned,
[1165.60 → 1168.60] especially for us long ago.
[1168.60 → 1186.60] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[1186.60 → 1189.60] It's a beautiful day,
[1189.60 → 1193.60] and it's good to worship the Lord with you,
[1193.60 → 1198.60] even though we are still scattered as the body of Christ.
[1198.60 → 1202.60] So we are, as you know, in the church season of Easter,
[1202.60 → 1206.60] and Easter is the season when we join with the church around the world
[1206.60 → 1210.60] to reflect upon the risen Jesus Christ
[1210.60 → 1212.60] and the hope that he brings.
[1212.60 → 1215.60] And our hope is that because Christ rose again,
[1215.60 → 1219.60] we will also with him rise again.
[1219.60 → 1222.60] And that hope is sure.
[1222.60 → 1227.60] And even in the midst of all the uncertainty that we face in our lives and in the world,
[1227.60 → 1230.60] that is our hope, that Christ is risen,
[1230.60 → 1232.60] and we too will rise with him.
[1232.60 → 1236.60] So in this series, we're in a sermon series entitled,
[1236.60 → 1237.60] You Are.
[1237.60 → 1244.60] It is only as we keep our eyes fixed upon Jesus
[1244.60 → 1248.60] that we truly discover who we really are.
[1248.60 → 1254.60] And so far in this series, we've considered our identity as Christians,
[1254.60 → 1258.60] and we've looked at these different titles of being disciples of Jesus Christ,
[1258.60 → 1260.60] where we follow him.
[1260.60 → 1264.60] We've looked at how we are witnesses to Jesus,
[1264.60 → 1268.60] how we are servants of God and of one another,
[1268.60 → 1272.60] how we are children of the Heavenly Father.
[1272.60 → 1277.60] And today we're going to consider our identity as members of the body of Christ,
[1277.60 → 1279.60] that we are members one of another.
[1279.60 → 1282.60] And so let's look at our text this morning.
[1282.60 → 1285.60] It's in 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
[1285.60 → 1289.60] a very kind of familiar passage to us.
[1289.60 → 1292.60] We'll read verses 12 to 27.
[1292.60 → 1299.60] Just as a body, though one, has many parts,
[1299.60 → 1303.60] but all its many parts form one body,
[1303.60 → 1305.60] so it is with Christ.
[1305.60 → 1307.60] For we were all baptized by one Spirit,
[1307.60 → 1309.60] to form one body,
[1309.60 → 1312.60] whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free,
[1312.60 → 1316.60] and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
[1316.60 → 1321.60] Even so, the body is not made up of one part, but of many.
[1321.60 → 1324.60] Now if the foot should say,
[1324.60 → 1328.60] Well, because I am not a hand, I don't belong to the body,
[1328.60 → 1333.60] it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
[1333.60 → 1335.60] And if the ear should say,
[1335.60 → 1338.60] Well, because I'm not an eye, I do not belong to the body,
[1338.60 → 1341.60] it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
[1341.60 → 1346.60] If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[1346.60 → 1350.60] If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
[1350.60 → 1353.60] But in fact, God has placed the parts in the body,
[1353.60 → 1357.60] every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
[1357.60 → 1360.60] If they were all one part, where would the body be?
[1360.60 → 1365.60] As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
[1365.60 → 1368.60] The eye cannot say to the hand, I don't need you.
[1368.60 → 1371.60] The head cannot say to the feet, I don't need you.
[1371.60 → 1375.60] On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker
[1375.60 → 1378.60] or indispensable are indispensable.
[1378.60 → 1381.60] And the parts that we think are less honourable,
[1381.60 → 1383.60] we treat with special honour.
[1383.60 → 1389.60] And the parts that are unrepresentable are treated with special modesty.
[1389.60 → 1394.60] Well, our presentable parts need no special treatment.
[1394.60 → 1399.60] But God has put the body together, giving greater honour to the parts that lacked it,
[1399.60 → 1402.60] so that there should be no division in the body,
[1402.60 → 1407.60] but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
[1407.60 → 1410.60] If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[1410.60 → 1413.60] If one part is honoured, every part rejoices with it.
[1413.60 → 1418.60] Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
[1418.60 → 1423.60] Friends, this is the word of the Lord.
[1423.60 → 1425.60] He gives it to us because he loves us.
[1425.60 → 1429.60] He wants to teach us what it means to be his followers in this world.
[1429.60 → 1433.60] So let's come before the Lord in prayer as we open up this passage together.
[1433.60 → 1439.60] Father, we come before you as members of you,
[1439.60 → 1445.60] of being part in a mystical and spiritual sense of being united to Christ by faith,
[1445.60 → 1448.60] where we also are united to one another.
[1448.60 → 1453.60] And Lord, especially in this season of COVID, when we don't really experience that,
[1453.60 → 1455.60] Lord, we need to be reminded.
[1455.60 → 1457.60] We need to know who we are.
[1457.60 → 1460.60] So Lord, would you open up your word to us?
[1460.60 → 1467.60] Would you teach us and instruct us so that we might know you and live for you?
[1467.60 → 1470.60] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1470.60 → 1477.60] So one of the stories I would read to my kids is this children's book.
[1477.60 → 1480.60] And it's the story of Swimmy.
[1480.60 → 1490.60] So Swimmy is a small fish, and he lived in a larger school of fish, you know, with his brothers and sisters,
[1490.60 → 1493.60] and they all lived in this vast ocean together.
[1493.60 → 1502.60] But one very sad day, a big fish came along and ate the entire school of fish that Swimmy was a part of,
[1502.60 → 1507.60] including all of his brothers and sisters, and only Swimmy escaped.
[1507.60 → 1514.60] And so Swimmy, as you can imagine, right, if you are a little fish all alone in a dark, wet world,
[1514.60 → 1520.60] he is frightened, he is sad, he is all alone.
[1520.60 → 1526.60] And the point in the story, Swimmy, swimming through the ocean,
[1526.60 → 1531.60] and he comes upon another school of fish, much like his own.
[1531.60 → 1540.60] And they are also afraid because of all the other big fish out there in the ocean that can eat them.
[1540.60 → 1546.60] So Swimmy and the other fish eventually discover, we'll show you on the next page of the book,
[1546.60 → 1557.60] that if they swim together, and if they would band together and live together and kind of form themselves in such a way,
[1557.60 → 1565.60] that they can look like a big fish and then scare away all the other big fish, because they're actually even bigger.
[1565.60 → 1576.60] And so as you look at the picture, some fish are the tail, some are the fin, some are kind of part of the body, and Swimmy is the eye.
[1576.60 → 1581.60] And so even though they are many, they become one.
[1581.60 → 1587.60] Because of this, they are able to swim freely in this vast ocean and scare away all the other large fish.
[1587.60 → 1601.60] And so as they decide to swim as a community, each one of them individually finds safety and freedom and connection and purpose for their lives.
[1601.60 → 1610.60] And so I think this is a picture of what this passage in 1 Corinthians is all about.
[1610.60 → 1620.60] When God saves us, it's not only about bringing us into relationship with himself, we're also made a part of a community called the church.
[1620.60 → 1630.60] And especially in this time of COVID-19 and the way we are forced, this very odd way of being scattered and apart for a very long time,
[1630.60 → 1639.60] we need this reminder about who we are and who we are meant to be as the church, which is members of the body of Christ.
[1639.60 → 1648.60] And so as we look at this passage, I just want us to consider together these three dimensions of what it means that we are members of the body.
[1648.60 → 1651.60] So just upward, inward, and outward.
[1651.60 → 1653.60] Okay, upward, inward, outward.
[1653.60 → 1667.60] We are members of Christ's body in terms of our upward relationship with God, our inward relationship with one another, and then also our outward relationship in the world.
[1667.60 → 1672.60] So, let's think first about the upward.
[1672.60 → 1674.60] And so that's our first point this morning.
[1674.60 → 1677.60] So in verses 12 and 13, Paul writes,
[1677.60 → 1703.60] So Paul begins this passage with a metaphor of the church as the body of Christ.
[1703.60 → 1712.60] And he begins this extended reflection on what it means to be the body of Christ in this passage, 1 Corinthians 12.
[1712.60 → 1724.60] And he starts off by saying that who we are as the body is fundamentally grounded and is based on our relationship with the living Jesus Christ himself.
[1724.60 → 1733.60] And so then notice how he uses the sacramental imagery of water that we drink and of baptism.
[1733.60 → 1743.60] And he's saying that what makes us members of the body of Christ is being united to Christ through the Spirit, this baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1743.60 → 1746.60] And so what does that mean? What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit?
[1746.60 → 1756.60] The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the inward work of the Holy Spirit coming into our lives to show us our sin and our need for a Saviour.
[1756.60 → 1769.60] So we were once outside the body of Christ, not united to Christ, but because of God's grace, the Holy Spirit comes, He enters our lives, He takes our heart of stone and makes it a heart of flesh.
[1769.60 → 1772.60] While we were dead in sin, He makes us alive to Christ.
[1772.60 → 1778.60] So then we see Jesus by His grace, and we can put our trust in Him.
[1778.60 → 1791.60] And then we become not only Christians where we become part of Jesus, where we have a relationship with Him through the Holy Spirit, but we also become part of the church.
[1791.60 → 1795.60] So then we have the sacrament of baptism.
[1795.60 → 1799.60] You know, we have been celebrating all of these baptisms over the last week.
[1799.60 → 1810.60] And with the waters of baptism that are a sign and a seal of this inward reality of regeneration of the Holy Spirit, where we are made alive to God.
[1810.60 → 1813.60] So then this water is a sign of that.
[1813.60 → 1816.60] And so this is how we become a member of the body of Christ.
[1816.60 → 1818.60] We are united to Jesus through the Spirit.
[1818.60 → 1823.60] And this Spirit is given to Jew and Gentile, to slave and free.
[1823.60 → 1832.60] There is no distinction, but all are united equally and freely by this grace of the Spirit.
[1832.60 → 1845.60] So another thing, you know, when we look at Paul's writings, in Ephesians chapter 4, he clarifies this image even a bit more, where he says that Christ Himself is the head of the body.
[1845.60 → 1847.60] So he says it like this,
[1847.60 → 1857.60] We will grow to become in every respect the mature body of Him who is the head, that is, Christ.
[1857.60 → 1861.60] From Him the whole body is joined and held together.
[1861.60 → 1869.60] Okay, so that means that when we think about the church as a body, Jesus is the head.
[1869.60 → 1881.60] The church then is a place where every part in the body plays a role in the health of that body, but no member of the body is the head except Jesus.
[1881.60 → 1886.60] Which means that Jesus is the controlling force of the church.
[1886.60 → 1894.60] And friends, this is incredibly important for us to understand, that the church at its core, as a community of men and women and boys and girls,
[1894.60 → 1905.60] who have been redeemed by Jesus, whose lives are then built around Jesus, and who we see Jesus as the centre of everything that we do.
[1905.60 → 1910.60] And that means that our unity that we have with one another is in Christ.
[1910.60 → 1917.60] Our unity that we have is in together knowing Christ, following Christ, and serving Christ.
[1917.60 → 1923.60] Living according to His will and agenda, and not anything that we can kind of make up on our own.
[1923.60 → 1927.60] That is the foundation and the centre of who we are as a church.
[1927.60 → 1931.60] Because without Christ as the head of the church, it is not a church.
[1931.60 → 1934.60] It is a social club or something else.
[1934.60 → 1941.60] And this is why the church is not a place that is constantly driven by fads or whatever is popular in the culture,
[1941.60 → 1944.60] where we look to the culture to tell us who we should be.
[1944.60 → 1946.60] But instead we look to Christ.
[1946.60 → 1951.60] The church is continually a place that gathers around the person of Christ,
[1951.60 → 1957.60] in accordance with the gospel, under the authority of the scriptures, empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[1957.60 → 1963.60] That means we are not a people who create a new message or change the message,
[1963.60 → 1969.60] but we give the same message and that same message as is proclaimed and as we hear it,
[1969.60 → 1970.60] creates new life.
[1970.60 → 1972.60] And it gives newness of life.
[1972.60 → 1975.60] And that is the essence of the gospel.
[1975.60 → 1978.60] This is what the gospel has been doing for thousands of years.
[1978.60 → 1983.60] So the main way that we need to conceive of our life together and our union with one another
[1983.60 → 1986.60] is through this vertical union with Christ himself.
[1986.60 → 1989.60] He is the head. We are the body.
[1989.60 → 1992.60] We become members of the body of Christ.
[1992.60 → 1994.60] And so that is the first dimension.
[1994.60 → 1996.60] Upward to Jesus.
[1996.60 → 1998.60] This is important.
[1998.60 → 2005.60] So then, Paul also though talks about in this passage this other dimension,
[2005.60 → 2007.60] which is the inward dimension.
[2007.60 → 2015.60] And it is in this inward dimension that we actually most profoundly experience being the church together.
[2015.60 → 2018.60] So moving on to verse 14, Paul says,
[2018.60 → 2022.60] Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
[2022.60 → 2025.60] Okay, so there is this unity and diversity.
[2025.60 → 2027.60] There is this one and many.
[2027.60 → 2032.60] Paul says that when you become a Christian, you become part of a new community.
[2032.60 → 2038.60] And he gives us again, you know, he is talking about this illustration of the body to help us understand what that means.
[2038.60 → 2042.60] So let's, you know, think about the body for a moment.
[2042.60 → 2045.60] So a body is composed of individual parts.
[2045.60 → 2051.60] So when we look at a body, we can talk about the hand, the nose, the eyes, the ears, the feet, all of these things.
[2051.60 → 2054.60] But we also know that it's one body.
[2054.60 → 2057.60] The ear by itself doesn't make any sense.
[2057.60 → 2060.60] But it only makes sense as part of the body.
[2060.60 → 2069.60] And so when you have a healthy body, all the parts are functioning harmoniously, and they are interdependent on one another.
[2069.60 → 2071.60] Each part needs the other.
[2071.60 → 2077.60] The body can't really function in a healthy way if one part is sick or missing or something like that.
[2077.60 → 2084.60] So what Paul is saying is that it's the same way in the church, which is the body of Christ.
[2084.60 → 2091.60] So as we look at this passage, there are two things I want us to note in this kind of longer part of the text.
[2091.60 → 2093.60] And it's this.
[2093.60 → 2101.60] That our life together as the body means that the church is a place of connection and a place of contribution.
[2101.60 → 2105.60] Okay, so connection and contribution.
[2105.60 → 2108.60] So first, it's a place of contribution.
[2108.60 → 2117.60] Jesus wants to use you to utilize you to be a healthy contributing member of the body.
[2117.60 → 2126.60] So one of Paul's main points here is that every single part of the body matters.
[2126.60 → 2127.60] Right?
[2127.60 → 2132.60] He is so adamant about this point that, you know, he uses this exaggerated language.
[2132.60 → 2134.60] So in verse 15, he says,
[2134.60 → 2138.60] Now if the foot should say, because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body,
[2138.60 → 2142.60] it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
[2142.60 → 2144.60] In other words, that doesn't make any sense.
[2144.60 → 2148.60] Every part is unique and different from the other.
[2148.60 → 2152.60] And that doesn't make it any less a part of the body.
[2152.60 → 2155.60] So then in verse 17, he says,
[2155.60 → 2159.60] If the whole body were just an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[2159.60 → 2162.60] If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
[2162.60 → 2169.60] So a couple of years ago, my son John came home from school with this kind of game that they had done.
[2169.60 → 2172.60] Where you make a monster.
[2172.60 → 2175.60] So they have all the body parts of the monster cut out.
[2175.60 → 2180.60] So you have a bunch of pile of ears, a pile of eyes, hands, all these parts of the body.
[2180.60 → 2182.60] And so you roll a die.
[2182.60 → 2186.60] And you know, maybe the eye is number one, ear number two, whatever.
[2186.60 → 2192.60] So you roll a die and whatever number, you add that body part to the body of the monster.
[2192.60 → 2198.60] But one time, you actually might end up rolling five times in a row.
[2198.60 → 2202.60] So you actually end up with a monster with like no nose and no ears.
[2202.60 → 2206.60] But you have like, you know, whatever, five mouths or something like that.
[2206.60 → 2208.60] And that would be really weird.
[2208.60 → 2213.60] But that's not the way that God has made the body of Christ.
[2213.60 → 2217.60] God doesn't want a monster with five mouths or five ears.
[2217.60 → 2221.60] Each part has a part to play.
[2221.60 → 2224.60] Then in verse 18, he underscores that.
[2224.60 → 2229.60] He says, God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
[2229.60 → 2236.60] So friends, what that means is that Jesus looks at you and says, you are a part of my body.
[2236.60 → 2244.60] You belong to me and I have appointed you to be a part of the body uniquely.
[2244.60 → 2246.60] This is who we are.
[2246.60 → 2256.60] This is one of these identities that comes to us as a Christian when we put our faith in Christ.
[2256.60 → 2262.60] That you become a life-giving, life-sustaining member of the body of Jesus.
[2262.60 → 2268.60] And as part of the body, you come with, into the church, you come as a unique person.
[2268.60 → 2272.60] You come with, you know, all of your strengths and weaknesses.
[2272.60 → 2276.60] You come with all of your gifts and all of your mistakes.
[2276.60 → 2282.60] Each one of our stories has beauty and brokenness in it.
[2282.60 → 2285.60] Because he has made you to be a member of the body, though.
[2285.60 → 2293.60] You know, I think sometimes we can feel kind of insecure when we think about our usefulness to the kingdom of God.
[2293.60 → 2298.60] Sometimes we come to the church and feel like, you know, maybe I'm not that useful.
[2298.60 → 2303.60] Maybe I'm not making, you know, a very obvious contribution.
[2303.60 → 2305.60] But here's the thing.
[2305.60 → 2312.60] Paul says every person in the body of Christ has something to contribute to the body of Christ.
[2312.60 → 2317.60] Right? And that means that Jesus knew exactly what he was doing when he chose you.
[2317.60 → 2318.60] Right?
[2318.60 → 2331.60] God chose you before the foundation of the world, not only to be united to him by faith, but also for the purpose that you would become part of his body.
[2331.60 → 2334.60] Right? So you didn't just end up here on your own accord.
[2334.60 → 2337.60] You came here because the spirit drew you.
[2337.60 → 2342.60] And you are a part of this body because God wants to therefore use you in the body.
[2342.60 → 2346.60] Every member of the body plays a significant role.
[2346.60 → 2353.60] And we need to let that reality shape the way that we look at one another in the body of Christ.
[2353.60 → 2359.60] Because, you know, when we think about our church, we think about this local congregation,
[2359.60 → 2366.60] the Latin or Christian Reformed Church, every single person, you know, if you think back before COVID,
[2366.60 → 2370.60] when we were all here, and you think about where you sit.
[2370.60 → 2374.60] You know, Dorothy sometimes said, oh, you know that person, they sit in that spot.
[2374.60 → 2379.60] And I'm saying, you know, I really haven't been here long enough in person to know where everyone sits yet.
[2379.60 → 2380.60] I'll get there.
[2380.60 → 2385.60] But if you think about where you sit and those on a Sunday who are near you,
[2385.60 → 2392.60] or if you think about those people whom you would greet and chat with in the fellowship hall,
[2392.60 → 2398.60] or those that you might gather with in Bible studies or small groups,
[2398.60 → 2401.60] or maybe even those people who used to bother you,
[2401.60 → 2410.60] they are desired and loved and invited by Jesus to be a valuable part of this church.
[2410.60 → 2412.60] Every single one of them.
[2412.60 → 2416.60] You know, I like to think about a puzzle.
[2416.60 → 2419.60] So maybe you have a thousand-piece puzzle.
[2419.60 → 2421.60] Three thousand-piece puzzle.
[2421.60 → 2424.60] And when you do that, you're starting out, what do you have is,
[2424.60 → 2428.60] you open the box and dump it out, and you have a pile of puzzle pieces.
[2428.60 → 2435.60] And when you have this pile of puzzle pieces, each piece by itself doesn't look like a big deal.
[2435.60 → 2437.60] I mean, you have a whole pile of them, thousands.
[2437.60 → 2439.60] They all kind of look alike, actually.
[2439.60 → 2445.60] But after you start putting the puzzle together, and the whole puzzle is complete, except for what?
[2445.60 → 2448.60] The one piece that is missing.
[2448.60 → 2456.60] And when you have that one missing piece, you can really see the significance of each individual puzzle piece.
[2456.60 → 2463.60] And in the same way, sometimes in the church, we can sometimes feel like, you know, amongst everyone, we might not matter that much,
[2463.60 → 2468.60] but every single Christian is as unique as a puzzle piece.
[2468.60 → 2471.60] God created you with a unique contribution to make to the church.
[2471.60 → 2474.60] No other person is like you.
[2474.60 → 2479.60] No other person has the same abilities, the same ideas, the same experiences.
[2479.60 → 2491.60] And just like a puzzle piece, when you go missing under the rug, if you know, if you don't show up, if you don't make that contribution of who you are in the body,
[2491.60 → 2499.60] there's a hole in the picture, and the overall picture is less beautiful because you're not there.
[2499.60 → 2505.60] God made you to be a part of this beautiful picture that is the church.
[2505.60 → 2514.60] And that, more than anything, should shape how we view one another in the body of Christ, that we each have a contribution to make.
[2514.60 → 2524.60] But not only that, Paul also says that there's this, not only that we're each unique, but there's this connection that we have with one another.
[2524.60 → 2528.60] So that's the next point, this contribution, this connection.
[2528.60 → 2532.60] So in verses 21 and 22, Paul says,
[2532.60 → 2536.60] The eye cannot say to the hand, I don't need you.
[2536.60 → 2540.60] The head cannot say to the feet, I don't need you.
[2540.60 → 2545.60] On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem weaker are indispensable.
[2545.60 → 2548.60] In other words, we need one another.
[2548.60 → 2554.60] Paul says no member can look at another and say, I actually don't need you.
[2554.60 → 2555.60] I am self-sufficient.
[2555.60 → 2561.60] I don't need other brothers and sisters in the body because I have all the ideas.
[2561.60 → 2565.60] I have all of, you know, what I need to live the Christian life.
[2567.60 → 2571.60] That is completely foreign to the scriptures.
[2571.60 → 2574.60] There is no such thing as an isolated Christian life.
[2574.60 → 2580.60] Christianity, kind of going back to swimming, there's no such thing as a lone fish swimming in the ocean by yourself.
[2580.60 → 2585.60] That we all are part of this larger school of fish.
[2585.60 → 2593.60] And when we look at the Bible, all of theare in the New Testament are, for the most part, plural.
[2593.60 → 2597.60] Right? It's addressing the body of Christ together.
[2597.60 → 2603.60] And so what we need to hear from this is that we actually need one another.
[2603.60 → 2614.60] That other people in the body have things that, apart from them, our experience of Christ is incomplete.
[2614.60 → 2624.60] Right? We all have our different perspectives, our own gifts, our own inclinations, the way of experiencing God and living the Christian life.
[2624.60 → 2626.60] We need each other.
[2626.60 → 2637.60] And that is why Jesus is building this one large body of people from every tongue, tribe, people, and nation to honour and glorify him in the fullness of who he is.
[2637.60 → 2642.60] Right? We love everyone for the contribution they make.
[2642.60 → 2643.60] And we need one another.
[2643.60 → 2645.60] We need to be connected to the body.
[2645.60 → 2651.60] Because only then can we truly glorify God in being the body of Christ.
[2651.60 → 2665.60] So friends, this means that anything that divides the body, whether it is gossip, whether it is bitterness or discrimination against one person, or resentment for whatever reason.
[2665.60 → 2670.60] Maybe you are thinking, well, I value this, and no one is paying attention to what I value or something.
[2670.60 → 2674.60] Or discounting someone, or even deviating from sound doctrine.
[2674.60 → 2679.60] Any of this is like a cancer in the body because it harms the entire body.
[2679.60 → 2686.60] But at the same time, Paul tells us to exhort one another.
[2686.60 → 2694.60] To rebuke and correct and to sharpen one another so that in love we may be built up to become more and more like Jesus.
[2694.60 → 2695.60] Right?
[2695.60 → 2705.60] And because it is not this squishy relativism that unites us where we put aside biblical truth and biblical ethics for the sake of just getting along,
[2705.60 → 2708.60] that is not what connects us in the body.
[2708.60 → 2716.60] Rather, it is a common desire and willingness to submit ourselves to God, to pursue truth and holiness,
[2716.60 → 2720.60] where we receive our identity from Jesus, not from anything else.
[2720.60 → 2727.60] So at the same time, we are also invited to understand that when one part of the body is hurting,
[2727.60 → 2730.60] it should be the case that we all hurt.
[2730.60 → 2732.60] Because we are connected.
[2732.60 → 2737.60] And when one part of the body is rejoicing, even if we are not personally,
[2737.60 → 2743.60] we should be able to celebrate and be glad because that part of the body is rejoicing.
[2743.60 → 2745.60] So we all rejoice together.
[2745.60 → 2748.60] To weep with those who weep, to rejoice with those who rejoice.
[2748.60 → 2756.60] So what this passage is saying is that we are a people who are connected to one another by Jesus.
[2756.60 → 2758.60] That we are one people of God.
[2758.60 → 2763.60] That we are not just redeemed individually, we are redeemed together.
[2763.60 → 2765.60] We are forgiven together.
[2765.60 → 2767.60] We are growing in Christ together.
[2767.60 → 2769.60] We are loved by God together.
[2769.60 → 2773.60] And we are on mission in this world together as the body.
[2773.60 → 2775.60] And it's a beautiful picture of the church.
[2775.60 → 2780.60] Because it reminds us that not only does each person have a unique contribution to make,
[2780.60 → 2790.60] but our uniqueness is actually discovered and highlighted and comes out in connection and in relationship with one another.
[2790.60 → 2796.60] Otherwise, if you're just by yourself, your uniqueness isn't, doesn't have a purpose.
[2796.60 → 2799.60] Because it's not in connection with the body.
[2799.60 → 2804.60] Where you're here to serve and to contribute.
[2805.60 → 2810.60] So this is this inward dimension that we have with the body of Christ.
[2810.60 → 2815.60] So not only is it upward with God, where Christ is the head of the body, we are united to him.
[2815.60 → 2821.60] But also, because we're united to Christ, we have this experience of being the body,
[2821.60 → 2824.60] where we can all contribute and connect with one another.
[2824.60 → 2831.60] So then finally, I want us to consider briefly the outward dimension of being members of the body of Christ.
[2831.60 → 2833.60] And that is simply this.
[2833.60 → 2845.60] That we as the body are a public, invisible witness to an expression of the living Jesus Christ in the world.
[2845.60 → 2848.60] Right? We are his body in the world.
[2848.60 → 2851.60] Okay? And that is the outward dimension of it.
[2851.60 → 2854.60] So I want to share this quote from Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[2854.60 → 2857.60] It's from his book called The Cost of Discipleship.
[2857.60 → 2864.60] So Bonhoeffer has an extremely high view of the church and of the importance of the church.
[2864.60 → 2866.60] And he said this.
[2866.60 → 2874.60] Since the ascension, Christ's place on earth has been taken by his body, the church.
[2874.60 → 2879.60] The church is the real presence of Christ in the world.
[2879.60 → 2880.60] Right?
[2880.60 → 2886.60] So that's why in the book of Acts, Luke is writing to this guy named Theophilus.
[2886.60 → 2887.60] And he says,
[2887.60 → 2894.60] In my former book, which is the Gospel of Acts, I wrote all about what Jesus began to do and to teach.
[2894.60 → 2897.60] He began to do, which is just his life on earth.
[2897.60 → 2898.60] Because that's the gospel.
[2898.60 → 2904.60] It's all about Jesus's life on earth up until the day he was taken up into heaven.
[2904.60 → 2908.60] And then in the book of Acts, Luke is continuing the story.
[2908.60 → 2911.60] And it starts with Jesus's ascension.
[2911.60 → 2920.60] But before Jesus ascends to heaven, he sends his followers out into the world to be his witnesses, to continue his work.
[2920.60 → 2927.60] And what that tells us is that the church as the body of Christ in the world continues the work of Jesus in the world.
[2927.60 → 2930.60] And that means the church involves incarnation.
[2930.60 → 2931.60] Right?
[2931.60 → 2938.60] The eternal word of God, Jesus Christ, became flesh and made his dwelling amongst us.
[2938.60 → 2947.60] And so if you want to know what it means to be the body of Christ, we just have to look to the life of Jesus when he walked on earth.
[2947.60 → 2954.60] And Jesus defined incarnational living really in two ways.
[2954.60 → 2961.60] Complete identification with the Father and complete identification with humanity.
[2961.60 → 2973.60] So for us then, as the body of Christ in the world, because Jesus has left, but we are the body, his body, continuing in the world to carry out his mission.
[2973.60 → 2981.60] What that means for us in the same way is complete identification with Jesus and complete identification with a broken and lost world.
[2981.60 → 2986.60] So we are bringing Jesus to a lost world.
[2986.60 → 2999.60] The ministry of Jesus when he was alive on earth is continued in his ministry through his body, the church, in the world, which is indwelt and empowered by the Spirit of Christ.
[2999.60 → 3000.60] It's the same ministry.
[3000.60 → 3012.60] And he invites us now again to follow him, to bear witness to who he is in our life together, both individually and corporately.
[3012.60 → 3023.60] So friends, what that means is that one of the great invitations of the gospel to the church is for our life together in the world to be what Leslie Newborn calls a hermeneutic of the gospel.
[3023.60 → 3030.60] And what that means is that our life as the body is to explain to the world who Christ is.
[3030.60 → 3040.60] So when the world sees us, the church, as the body of Christ, it sees who Jesus is, it sees what he's like, it sees what he cares about.
[3040.60 → 3050.60] And what that means is that Jesus actually intends for our neighbours in Ladder and Delta and Richmond to encounter him through us.
[3050.60 → 3057.60] That people come to faith, they discover what it means to be a Christian and who Jesus is through the church.
[3057.60 → 3060.60] So that means we're constantly reaching out.
[3060.60 → 3079.32] We're constantly inviting and welcoming in so that people, as they are among us in a worshipping community, in a community that cares for one another, in a community that is living as the body of Christ together, that they become attracted as we live out the gospel together.
[3079.32 → 3084.32] And then they put their faith in Christ and become part of the body.
[3084.32 → 3090.32] People encounter Christ through the church, through our life together, for our care for one another, through true community.
[3090.32 → 3100.32] We love people well because we are loved so well by God, by Jesus Christ, who is the head of the church.
[3100.32 → 3101.32] Okay?
[3101.32 → 3104.32] So let's pray together.
[3104.32 → 3118.32] Father, we thank you for this passage that tells us who we are as the body of Christ, that we are not individual lone rangers when it comes to the Christian faith.
[3118.32 → 3121.32] But you have made us part of this body.
[3121.32 → 3131.32] Lord, would you, even in this time of COVID when we are so scattered, we feel lonely, we feel isolated, would you help us to know this reality?
[3131.32 → 3138.32] Would you help us as the body find creative ways to connect with one another, to contribute to one another?
[3138.32 → 3145.32] And Lord, would you help us be the body of Christ in this community that you have placed us in?
[3145.32 → 3151.32] We pray for your help by the Spirit's power and work within us to the glory of God.
[3151.32 → 3154.32] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3154.32 → 3175.32] The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ, the Lord,
[3175.32 → 3185.64] the church's one foundation is Jesus Christ
[3185.64 → 3192.52] creation by water and the world
[3192.52 → 3201.32] from heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride
[3201.32 → 3211.32] with his own blood he bought her and for her life he died
[3211.32 → 3225.00] from every nation yet one o'er all the earth her charter of salvation
[3225.00 → 3238.20] one wonder faith one birth one holy name she blesses heartaches one holy food
[3238.20 → 3248.68] and to what hope she presses with every praise and good
[3248.68 → 3257.24] in toil and tribulation and to moms of her war
[3257.24 → 3264.28] she waits the consummation of peace forever
[3264.28 → 3267.72] more
[3267.72 → 3276.60] which is
[3285.88 → 3286.68] before
[3286.68 → 3311.20] Just before we go to God in prayer, just an announcement that Jake's mom Annie is not well,
[3311.20 → 3316.20] and she is under palliative care in her home, so please add her to your prayer list as well.
[3316.68 → 3318.24] Let's pray together.
[3318.24 → 3328.82] Almighty Creator, Ascended Jesus, Holy Comforter, we praise and thank you for all you have given us through Christ.
[3329.60 → 3339.20] We are your adopted children, redeemed, made holy and whole, and ushered into loving relationship with you.
[3339.20 → 3348.46] We are deeply humbled to think on your love for us and that you delight in us more than the most doting parent or grandparent.
[3349.36 → 3355.32] Thank you for hearing us when we come to you with our worship and also our most pressing concerns.
[3355.32 → 3363.54] You know, Lord, how deeply this earth and its creatures have fallen from the glory in which you created them.
[3364.60 → 3369.34] We are in a mess, Lord, from the environment to our morality.
[3370.16 → 3373.26] We are sick, we are sinful, and we are selfish.
[3373.26 → 3380.88] Lord, we pray for peace in relationships in our homes, in our country, and around the world.
[3381.78 → 3387.52] Bring an end to conflict, especially the Palestinian-Israeli situation.
[3388.52 → 3393.12] May the long-standing issues be resolved and leaders seek peace.
[3393.90 → 3399.54] May peace replace violence wherever there is civil or international tension or war.
[3399.54 → 3401.54] May the long-standing issues be resolved and the same thing.
[3401.54 → 3410.04] Again, we ask that the recent surge of deaths, either through drug abuse or gang violence, would end here in the Lower Mainland.
[3411.32 → 3417.40] Lord, these young people have families who are mourning them and their choices that ended their lives.
[3418.22 → 3423.60] We pray for these families and urgently pray that this terrible onslaught might end.
[3424.60 → 3427.78] Give strength to those who work on the streets to help.
[3427.78 → 3432.00] First responders, social workers, and health providers.
[3432.70 → 3436.92] We lay this tragic situation before you, the giver of life.
[3437.90 → 3442.32] We ask again that the COVID pandemic might end all over the globe.
[3443.12 → 3447.26] We pray for India and the unspeakable loss and devastation there.
[3448.18 → 3449.36] Lord, have mercy.
[3450.56 → 3454.50] Here at home, we pray for those we know who are dealing with this virus.
[3454.50 → 3462.82] We ask healing especially for Greg and Julianne, especially since Greg has underlying conditions that could be concerning.
[3463.78 → 3469.00] Bring swift and complete healing for them and assurance for their children that all will be well.
[3469.82 → 3470.78] Be their rock.
[3470.78 → 3476.26] We also pray for those families who suffer financially because of this pandemic.
[3477.22 → 3484.94] May we all learn to trust you for our every need and make us generous people towards those who are struggling in a variety of ways.
[3486.70 → 3491.80] Bring healing and comfort, Lord, to those in our church who are sick or mourning.
[3491.80 → 3496.18] Lord, we remember Annie and ask that you would be with her.
[3496.88 → 3501.80] Give her a sense of your presence every day and also her family.
[3503.40 → 3508.06] O great physician, we yearn for complete healing of all our sorrows and ills.
[3509.24 → 3511.18] Walk with us and renew our faith.
[3512.18 → 3519.60] Give us new hope with every new day and eyes to see how great you are and how much we need you above all else.
[3519.60 → 3523.34] Give us a deep longing and love for you.
[3524.20 → 3529.62] Jesus, we look eagerly for that day when all sorrow, sickness, and tears will be wiped away.
[3530.76 → 3533.44] Prepare your bride to greet you soon.
[3534.30 → 3535.88] In your precious name we pray.
[3536.62 → 3536.94] Amen.
[3536.94 → 3537.08] Amen.
[3549.60 → 3554.28] Brothers and sisters, we come now to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3554.72 → 3564.86] And so this Sunday we're going to do things a little bit different whereas we come to the table and as we hear the words of institution and the invitation to eat and drink,
[3564.86 → 3572.28] we're actually going to intersperse that with a hymn that we can sing together as a way for us to kind of slow down,
[3572.60 → 3577.74] to meditate upon this time and upon Christ as we feed together.
[3577.74 → 3582.94] So first, this invitation.
[3584.70 → 3586.26] We are the body of Christ.
[3587.16 → 3590.14] But how can we become members of Christ's body?
[3590.14 → 3607.84] It is because Jesus himself came and took on flesh, and it was his body that was broken for us that we might be joined together as one and united together with Christ.
[3607.84 → 3615.52] And one of the fullest expressions of being the body of Christ that we get to experience is when we come to this table,
[3615.92 → 3622.00] this table of our Lord Jesus, and when we feed on his broken body that was given for us.
[3623.10 → 3626.46] But friends, this invitation is not for everyone.
[3627.40 → 3636.26] It is for those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ, who have received his broken body on their behalf and are united to him in faith.
[3636.26 → 3644.38] And so if that is you, if you have put your trust in Jesus and if you have been baptized as a sign of your union with Christ and with his body,
[3644.62 → 3650.52] then Jesus invites you to come and to commune with him and one another at this table.
[3651.10 → 3657.98] If you are not yet a follower of Jesus or if you have not yet been baptized, then this meal is not yet for you.
[3657.98 → 3660.14] But we hope that it would be soon.
[3660.50 → 3668.90] That you would take this opportunity to turn to Christ in faith to receive what he has done for you by his grace.
[3669.68 → 3673.22] So let's now sing the first verse of our song together.
[3673.22 → 3694.40] We hold the Lamb who bears our sins away, slain for us.
[3694.40 → 3709.56] And we remember the promise made that all who come in faith find forgiveness at the cross.
[3709.56 → 3733.76] So we share in this bread of life, and we drink of his sacrifice as a sign of our bonds of peace around the table of the King.
[3733.76 → 3739.16] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[3739.60 → 3741.86] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[3741.98 → 3745.82] This is my body, which is broken for you.
[3746.34 → 3747.88] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3748.84 → 3752.00] The same way also he took the cup after supper, saying,
[3752.10 → 3754.38] This cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[3755.10 → 3758.74] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[3758.74 → 3766.40] For as often as you eat this bread, and you drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[3767.30 → 3770.84] Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[3771.32 → 3775.28] Feed on him in your hearts by faith with Thanksgiving,
[3775.44 → 3780.14] knowing that Jesus Christ has died for you to make you part of his body.
[3780.14 → 3794.70] The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ, dawned for you.
[3796.10 → 3804.04] Meet and remember the wounds that heal, the death that brings us life.
[3804.38 → 3808.78] Pay the price to make us one.
[3808.78 → 3815.66] So we share in this bread of life.
[3815.66 → 3824.22] And we drink of his sacrifice as a sign.
[3824.68 → 3832.30] Of our wants of love around the table of the King.
[3832.30 → 3838.46] Time you may take your bread.
[3839.66 → 3844.48] Brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you.
[3845.04 → 3845.88] Let's eat together.
[3845.88 → 3845.92] Let's eat together.
[3845.92 → 3845.96] Let's eat together.
[3862.30 → 3875.92] Let's eat together.
[3875.92 → 3877.18] Let's eat together.
[3877.18 → 3879.18] Drink and remember.
[3879.18 → 3880.42] Drink and remember.
[3880.42 → 3891.30] Be drained as cup that all may enter in to receive the life of God.
[3891.30 → 3897.42] So we share in this bread of life.
[3897.42 → 3905.96] And we drink of his sacrifice as a sign.
[3905.96 → 3914.86] Of our wants of grace around the table of the King.
[3914.86 → 3921.16] So we will now drink together.
[3921.74 → 3927.94] Take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for you.
[3928.48 → 3929.40] Let's drink together.
[3929.40 → 3959.38] Let's drink together.
[3959.40 → 3963.72] A song for you.
[3963.72 → 3966.44] Let's drink together.
[3966.44 → 3972.28] Put your Wonky'so of God and as a sign.
[3972.44 → 3973.72] In the kingdom of God antalkaline.
[3973.72 → 3978.14] Live again droplet, May the Lord Jesus Christ was blessed as thorn and freedom you come out.
[3978.14 → 3982.36] We pray that the Lord ISO for you.
[3982.36 → 3987.22] They pray to many others that He Ba'nose them.
[3987.22 → 3991.38] Around the table of the king
[3991.38 → 4003.34] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have ministered to us in word and in sacrament.
[4004.12 → 4009.38] Lord, that you have called us to be one body through your broken body and your shed blood.
[4009.76 → 4014.54] Father, we praise you, we thank you for your amazing love, your amazing mercy,
[4014.54 → 4018.96] your amazing goodness to us, though we do not deserve it.
[4019.22 → 4024.12] We receive it gladly from your hands, and we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4026.20 → 4034.46] So friends, let's hear God's blessing over us as we go out to be his body in the world.
[4036.58 → 4041.20] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine,
[4041.20 → 4045.54] according to his power that is at work within us,
[4046.00 → 4050.42] to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
[4051.26 → 4053.38] forever and ever. Amen.
[4053.38 → 4075.36] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are worthy.
[4075.36 → 4085.42] All the earth and heaven sing praises to your name.
[4085.42 → 4095.08] Lamb of God, Holy One, righteous and forgiving.
[4096.36 → 4105.04] Morning star, rising sun, there is none like you.
[4105.36 → 4115.20] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4116.04 → 4124.90] Praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[4125.36 → 4135.04] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4135.36 → 4145.14] Praise the King of glory, praise Him for eternity.
[4145.14 → 4154.92] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son, praise the Son, praise the Son, praise the Son.
[4154.92 → 4164.70] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son, praise the Son.
[4164.70 → 4167.70] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son.
[4167.70 → 4180.48] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son.
[4180.48 → 4187.48] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son.
[4187.48 → 4195.74] When was the greatest of God?
[4195.74 → 4197.34] The worst of the person I could be the Lord
[4198.42 → 4202.34] Society, Matthew sends the letter to the faculty
