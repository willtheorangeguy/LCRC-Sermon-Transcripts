[38.68 --> 68.66]  Thank you.
[68.68 --> 98.66]  Thank you.
[98.68 --> 128.66]  Thank you.
[128.68 --> 158.66]  Thank you.
[158.68 --> 188.66]  Thank you.
[188.68 --> 218.66]  Thank you.
[218.68 --> 248.66]  Thank you.
[248.68 --> 278.66]  Thank you.
[278.68 --> 308.66]  Thank you.
[308.66 --> 338.64]  Thank you.
[338.66 --> 368.64]  Thank you.
[368.66 --> 398.64]  Thank you.
[398.64 --> 428.62]  Thank you.
[428.62 --> 458.60]  Thank you.
[458.60 --> 488.58]  Thank you.
[488.60 --> 489.90]  Amen.
[489.90 --> 496.50]  So today we light the Christmas, the Christ candle.
[497.44 --> 500.18]  So we'll invite our Advent readers to come up.
[518.60 --> 548.58]  Thank you.
[548.60 --> 578.58]  Thank you.
[578.60 --> 608.58]  Thank you.
[608.60 --> 638.58]  Thank you.
[638.60 --> 668.58]  Thank you.
[668.58 --> 698.56]  Thank you.
[698.58 --> 728.56]  Thank you.
[728.58 --> 758.56]  Thank you.
[758.56 --> 788.54]  Thank you.
[788.56 --> 818.54]  Thank you.
[818.56 --> 848.54]  It is Christmas.
[848.54 --> 878.52]  We feel a little bit, we feel a gentil, we feel a gentil, we feel a gentil, and we feel
[878.52 --> 908.50]  we breathe.
[908.50 --> 938.50]  Thank you.
[938.50 --> 968.48]  Thank you.
[968.50 --> 998.48]  Thank you.
[998.50 --> 1028.50]  And to the earth, we're
[1028.50 --> 1058.48]  And we'll see.
[1058.48 --> 1064.90]  For a king was their intent
[1064.90 --> 1069.58]  And to follow the star
[1069.58 --> 1073.48]  Wherever it went
[1074.02 --> 1078.48]  Noel, Noel
[1079.00 --> 1083.48]  Noel, Noel
[1083.48 --> 1091.48]  Born is the king of Israel
[1091.48 --> 1100.52]  Then entered in
[1100.52 --> 1104.48]  Those wise men three
[1104.48 --> 1108.94]  Fell reverently
[1108.94 --> 1114.30]  Upon their knee
[1114.30 --> 1119.20]  And offer there
[1119.20 --> 1123.82]  In his presence
[1123.82 --> 1127.94]  Their golden birth
[1127.94 --> 1133.16]  And frankincense
[1133.16 --> 1137.80]  Noel, Noel
[1137.80 --> 1143.16]  Noel, Noel
[1143.16 --> 1150.36]  Born is the king of Israel
[1150.36 --> 1165.90]  Ba.
[1165.90 --> 1195.88]  Thank you.
[1195.90 --> 1225.88]  Thank you.
[1225.90 --> 1234.74]  The stars in the bright sky look down where he lay.
[1235.28 --> 1244.82]  The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
[1244.82 --> 1256.08]  The cattle are lowly, the baby awakes.
[1256.08 --> 1265.24]  But little Lord Jesus, the crying he makes.
[1265.74 --> 1269.74]  I love you, Lord Jesus.
[1270.42 --> 1274.34]  Look down from the sky.
[1274.34 --> 1284.42]  And stay by my side until morning is nigh.
[1284.42 --> 1291.36]  Be near me, Lord Jesus.
[1291.96 --> 1295.42]  I ask you to stay.
[1296.46 --> 1300.36]  Close by me forever.
[1300.36 --> 1304.36]  And love me, I pray.
[1305.50 --> 1314.30]  Bless all the dear children in your tender care.
[1314.30 --> 1324.74]  Prepare us for heaven to live with you there.
[1324.74 --> 1332.12]  A prayer for Christmas Day.
[1332.40 --> 1333.04]  Let us pray.
[1333.04 --> 1344.96]  Lord Jesus, we lift up our voices of prayer and praise today as we think especially of your birth on that first Christmas morning.
[1344.96 --> 1357.18]  Lord, many people today will be celebrating Christmas Day with little or no understanding that in coming to earth in the form of a man, you came to die.
[1357.18 --> 1364.82]  So that all who believe on your name might be saved from their sins and have life and have life and have it more abundantly.
[1364.82 --> 1373.08]  We pray that your Holy Spirit will convict the hearts of many who have dismissed the truth of Christmas as a nice little story.
[1374.28 --> 1377.88]  Bring many, we pray, to see Christmas in a new light this year.
[1378.78 --> 1383.30]  And may they come to an understanding of the real meaning of your birth at Bethlehem.
[1384.10 --> 1391.08]  So that they may see along with us that the Christmas story this year in all of its glorious beauty.
[1391.08 --> 1396.70]  May your holy name be lifted up and may Jesus Christ be glorified this Christmas.
[1397.58 --> 1400.88]  For you alone deserve all honor and glory.
[1401.64 --> 1402.92]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[1404.14 --> 1404.42]  Amen.
[1407.30 --> 1408.92]  Let's stand for this song, shall we?
[1421.08 --> 1451.06]  Let's stand for this song, shall we?
[1451.08 --> 1481.06]  Let's stand for this song, shall we?
[1481.06 --> 1485.52]  study to the newborn King.
[1487.88 --> 1498.96]  Christ by highest heaven adore, Christ the everlasting Lord.
[1499.50 --> 1509.76]  Late in time behold him come, offspring of the virgin's womb.
[1509.76 --> 1514.76]  Hail the flesh, the Godhead see.
[1515.72 --> 1519.76]  Hail the incarnate Deity.
[1521.20 --> 1526.00]  Pleased as man with us to dwell,
[1526.66 --> 1530.70]  Jesus our Emmanuel.
[1532.14 --> 1537.06]  Hark the herald angels sing,
[1537.06 --> 1543.84]  Glory to the newborn King.
[1545.94 --> 1551.06]  Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace.
[1551.94 --> 1556.06]  Hail the Son of Righteousness.
[1557.46 --> 1562.52]  Light and life to all He brings,
[1562.52 --> 1567.52]  Risen with healing in His wings.
[1568.60 --> 1573.86]  Mild He lays His glory by,
[1574.22 --> 1578.52]  Born that we no more may die.
[1579.82 --> 1584.98]  Born to raise us from the earth,
[1585.52 --> 1590.68]  Born to give us second birth.
[1590.68 --> 1596.42]  Hark the herald angels sing,
[1596.92 --> 1602.68]  Glory to the newborn King.
[1602.68 --> 1627.80]  Merry Christmas again.
[1627.80 --> 1630.00]  Thank you.
[1631.28 --> 1635.90]  At Christmas, I really love singing these carols.
[1638.06 --> 1642.36]  They're so amazingly profound in what they say,
[1642.62 --> 1645.42]  and what they teach us about the Christian faith.
[1646.32 --> 1648.92]  And so at Christmas, through these carols that we sing,
[1648.92 --> 1653.22]  through Scripture, a story is told.
[1654.30 --> 1657.32]  A story that we need to hear.
[1658.20 --> 1659.46]  A story that we need to hear.
[1660.14 --> 1663.12]  In fact, Christmas is actually a tale of two stories.
[1664.08 --> 1667.22]  There's the big story that grabs the headlines,
[1667.66 --> 1672.72]  and then there's the small story that changes the world.
[1672.72 --> 1677.28]  So let's hear this story once again from the Gospel of Luke,
[1678.06 --> 1679.68]  beginning in chapter 2, verse 1.
[1681.46 --> 1685.76]  In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[1685.76 --> 1689.06]  that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[1690.06 --> 1693.74]  This was the first census that took place
[1693.74 --> 1695.88]  while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
[1695.88 --> 1710.54]  This is the big story that would have grabbed the headlines of the day.
[1711.42 --> 1714.72]  It's a story of chaos.
[1715.46 --> 1717.78]  Produced by Caesar Augustus.
[1718.70 --> 1720.82]  Lives were disrupted
[1720.82 --> 1727.10]  as he exercised military, political, and economic control
[1727.10 --> 1729.44]  over the entire Roman Empire.
[1729.60 --> 1733.68]  Think about all of the ancient world around the Mediterranean.
[1734.22 --> 1735.92]  About 45 million people.
[1737.54 --> 1738.84]  We would have seen people
[1738.84 --> 1741.70]  all over that world
[1741.70 --> 1743.12]  packing their bags.
[1744.16 --> 1748.00]  Not for a Christmas vacation to Hawaii
[1748.00 --> 1749.36]  to rest,
[1749.36 --> 1752.52]  but to travel to a place
[1752.52 --> 1754.08]  to register.
[1754.46 --> 1756.90]  To register for a government
[1756.90 --> 1758.90]  that would use that information
[1758.90 --> 1760.22]  to tax them
[1760.22 --> 1763.56]  or to impose other obligations.
[1764.84 --> 1767.08]  We would have heard the complaints
[1767.08 --> 1769.86]  of people as they traveled on those journeys.
[1771.22 --> 1773.50]  Who does Caesar think he is?
[1775.04 --> 1777.76]  How can I afford
[1777.76 --> 1780.48]  to be gone for weeks on end
[1780.48 --> 1782.54]  without work?
[1783.46 --> 1785.28]  Who is going to care
[1785.28 --> 1787.32]  for the livestock and the crops?
[1788.98 --> 1790.14]  How is
[1790.14 --> 1791.82]  granny
[1791.82 --> 1793.76]  going to make the trip?
[1795.08 --> 1795.68]  Right?
[1795.72 --> 1796.46]  We would have felt
[1796.46 --> 1797.66]  deep in our spirits
[1797.66 --> 1799.32]  this choking grasp
[1799.32 --> 1800.30]  of the Roman Empire
[1800.30 --> 1801.42]  that reached deep
[1801.42 --> 1802.66]  into the daily lives
[1802.66 --> 1803.84]  of the people.
[1803.84 --> 1803.90]  people.
[1805.12 --> 1806.18]  We would have understood
[1806.18 --> 1807.08]  that there was
[1807.08 --> 1808.38]  a big story
[1808.38 --> 1809.00]  that was grabbing
[1809.00 --> 1810.20]  all of the headlines
[1810.20 --> 1811.66]  that everyone was talking about
[1811.66 --> 1813.26]  and every step on the journey
[1813.26 --> 1814.36]  that all of these people
[1814.36 --> 1815.12]  made
[1815.12 --> 1816.88]  every step
[1816.88 --> 1818.48]  was a reminder.
[1819.00 --> 1820.28]  Every step was a
[1820.28 --> 1822.20]  stark reminder
[1822.20 --> 1823.38]  of just
[1823.38 --> 1824.68]  how much
[1824.68 --> 1825.44]  our lives have been
[1825.44 --> 1825.82]  disrupted.
[1825.82 --> 1828.80]  in many ways
[1828.80 --> 1829.64]  it kind of sounds
[1829.64 --> 1830.68]  like our story
[1830.68 --> 1831.94]  over the last
[1831.94 --> 1833.48]  18 months.
[1834.64 --> 1835.42]  For us
[1835.42 --> 1835.96]  we are living
[1835.96 --> 1837.40]  through a big story
[1837.40 --> 1838.06]  that is grabbing
[1838.06 --> 1838.84]  all the headlines
[1838.84 --> 1839.62]  almost every day.
[1839.74 --> 1840.16]  We read
[1840.16 --> 1841.30]  the headlines.
[1842.58 --> 1843.42]  It's a big story
[1843.42 --> 1844.10]  that is
[1844.10 --> 1844.92]  likewise
[1844.92 --> 1846.28]  disrupting
[1846.28 --> 1847.62]  our lives
[1847.62 --> 1849.00]  that is producing
[1849.00 --> 1849.56]  chaos
[1849.56 --> 1850.96]  and we
[1850.96 --> 1851.60]  certainly
[1851.60 --> 1852.46]  feel it
[1852.46 --> 1853.98]  every day
[1853.98 --> 1855.36]  and every week
[1855.36 --> 1855.94]  that goes by.
[1857.14 --> 1858.42]  But as is so often
[1858.42 --> 1858.92]  the case
[1858.92 --> 1860.32]  God is at work
[1860.32 --> 1862.24]  behind the scenes.
[1863.28 --> 1863.98]  God used
[1863.98 --> 1864.60]  the decree
[1864.60 --> 1865.16]  of a pagan
[1865.16 --> 1865.92]  Roman emperor
[1865.92 --> 1867.06]  to fulfill
[1867.06 --> 1868.06]  the prophecy
[1868.06 --> 1869.36]  of Micah.
[1870.26 --> 1870.70]  But you
[1870.70 --> 1871.38]  Bethlehem
[1871.38 --> 1872.06]  Ephrathah
[1872.06 --> 1873.16]  though you
[1873.16 --> 1873.86]  are small
[1873.86 --> 1874.82]  among the clans
[1874.82 --> 1875.26]  of Judah
[1875.26 --> 1876.74]  out of you
[1876.74 --> 1877.14]  will come
[1877.14 --> 1877.46]  for me
[1877.46 --> 1877.84]  one
[1877.84 --> 1878.30]  who will be
[1878.30 --> 1878.90]  the ruler
[1878.90 --> 1880.18]  of Israel.
[1881.70 --> 1882.52]  So friends
[1882.52 --> 1883.44]  Christmas is a time
[1883.44 --> 1884.26]  of two stories.
[1885.14 --> 1886.10]  The big story
[1886.10 --> 1886.66]  that grabs
[1886.66 --> 1887.42]  all the headlines
[1887.42 --> 1889.38]  but a small
[1889.38 --> 1890.24]  story
[1890.24 --> 1891.44]  that is
[1891.44 --> 1892.58]  changing the world.
[1893.90 --> 1894.54]  And so we read
[1894.54 --> 1895.10]  on in Luke's
[1895.10 --> 1895.46]  gospel.
[1897.46 --> 1898.36]  So Joseph
[1898.36 --> 1899.26]  also went up
[1899.26 --> 1899.90]  from the town
[1899.90 --> 1900.62]  of Nazareth
[1900.62 --> 1901.46]  in Galilee
[1901.46 --> 1902.46]  to Judea
[1902.46 --> 1903.90]  to Bethlehem
[1903.90 --> 1904.28]  the town
[1904.28 --> 1904.74]  of David
[1904.74 --> 1906.04]  because he
[1906.04 --> 1906.78]  belonged to
[1906.78 --> 1907.22]  the house
[1907.22 --> 1907.62]  in the line
[1907.62 --> 1908.04]  of David.
[1908.62 --> 1909.42]  He went there
[1909.42 --> 1909.96]  to register
[1909.96 --> 1910.60]  with Mary
[1910.60 --> 1911.40]  who was
[1911.40 --> 1911.78]  pledged
[1911.78 --> 1912.08]  to be
[1912.08 --> 1912.42]  married
[1912.42 --> 1913.50]  to him
[1913.50 --> 1914.36]  and was
[1914.36 --> 1914.90]  expecting
[1914.90 --> 1916.06]  a child.
[1918.88 --> 1919.52]  Imagine
[1919.52 --> 1920.48]  the hardship.
[1922.14 --> 1922.40]  I mean
[1922.40 --> 1922.72]  it was hard
[1922.72 --> 1923.36]  for everybody
[1923.36 --> 1925.64]  but imagine
[1925.64 --> 1926.76]  the extra
[1926.76 --> 1927.26]  burden
[1927.26 --> 1928.66]  for Joseph
[1928.66 --> 1929.32]  with Mary
[1929.32 --> 1930.52]  expecting a child
[1930.52 --> 1931.68]  right having
[1931.68 --> 1932.40]  to leave their
[1932.40 --> 1933.30]  home in Galilee
[1933.30 --> 1933.88]  and Nazareth
[1933.88 --> 1934.54]  and travel to
[1934.54 --> 1935.06]  Bethlehem
[1935.06 --> 1936.18]  a journey
[1936.18 --> 1936.58]  that would
[1936.58 --> 1936.96]  have been
[1936.96 --> 1938.26]  about 140
[1938.26 --> 1939.06]  kilometers
[1939.06 --> 1941.30]  walking
[1941.30 --> 1943.54]  at least
[1943.54 --> 1944.22]  a few days
[1944.22 --> 1944.62]  journey
[1944.62 --> 1946.44]  with Mary
[1946.44 --> 1946.90]  being so
[1946.90 --> 1947.26]  pregnant
[1947.26 --> 1947.74]  maybe
[1947.74 --> 1948.64]  five,
[1948.74 --> 1948.94]  six,
[1949.10 --> 1949.64]  seven days.
[1951.16 --> 1952.44]  From Galilee
[1952.44 --> 1953.52]  they headed
[1953.52 --> 1954.06]  south
[1954.06 --> 1955.84]  across the
[1955.84 --> 1956.42]  forests
[1956.42 --> 1957.12]  and the
[1957.12 --> 1957.86]  flatlands
[1957.86 --> 1958.50]  near the
[1958.50 --> 1959.16]  Jordan River
[1959.16 --> 1960.48]  places that
[1960.48 --> 1961.16]  actually had
[1961.16 --> 1961.86]  lions and
[1961.86 --> 1962.24]  bears.
[1963.30 --> 1964.02]  In fact
[1964.02 --> 1964.30]  there were
[1964.30 --> 1964.94]  even signs
[1964.94 --> 1965.50]  warning
[1965.50 --> 1966.04]  travelers
[1966.04 --> 1966.52]  of those
[1966.52 --> 1967.26]  wild animals
[1967.26 --> 1968.46]  and once
[1968.46 --> 1968.76]  they made
[1968.76 --> 1969.04]  it through
[1969.04 --> 1969.58]  the forest
[1969.58 --> 1970.02]  surrounding
[1970.02 --> 1970.46]  the Jordan
[1970.46 --> 1970.80]  River
[1970.80 --> 1971.30]  they had
[1971.30 --> 1971.68]  to go
[1971.68 --> 1972.54]  uphill.
[1972.68 --> 1972.92]  That's why
[1972.92 --> 1973.20]  it says
[1973.20 --> 1973.54]  they went
[1973.54 --> 1974.88]  up to
[1974.88 --> 1975.26]  Bethlehem.
[1975.36 --> 1975.92]  They went
[1975.92 --> 1976.30]  they were
[1976.30 --> 1976.84]  heading south
[1976.84 --> 1977.20]  but going
[1977.20 --> 1977.70]  uphill
[1977.70 --> 1978.40]  up
[1978.40 --> 1979.34]  through the
[1979.34 --> 1979.80]  mountains
[1979.80 --> 1980.26]  surrounding
[1980.26 --> 1980.92]  Jerusalem
[1980.92 --> 1982.10]  past
[1982.10 --> 1982.68]  Jerusalem
[1982.68 --> 1983.98]  and on
[1983.98 --> 1984.60]  to Bethlehem
[1984.60 --> 1985.62]  just south.
[1987.56 --> 1987.92]  And even
[1987.92 --> 1988.52]  though Caesar
[1988.52 --> 1989.10]  Augustus
[1989.10 --> 1990.08]  had inaugurated
[1990.08 --> 1991.06]  the Pax Romana
[1991.06 --> 1992.12]  bringing
[1992.12 --> 1993.38]  unprecedented
[1993.38 --> 1994.18]  peace and
[1994.18 --> 1994.58]  stability
[1994.58 --> 1995.02]  to the
[1995.02 --> 1995.86]  entire region
[1995.86 --> 1997.22]  making travel
[1997.22 --> 1997.80]  relatively
[1997.80 --> 1998.24]  safer
[1998.24 --> 1999.48]  and yet
[1999.48 --> 1999.86]  there would
[1999.86 --> 2000.22]  still be
[2000.22 --> 2000.94]  the constant
[2000.94 --> 2001.58]  threat
[2001.58 --> 2002.72]  of thieves
[2002.72 --> 2003.66]  and bandits
[2003.66 --> 2004.30]  on the
[2004.30 --> 2004.56]  road.
[2005.84 --> 2006.46]  What a
[2006.46 --> 2007.26]  difficult
[2007.26 --> 2008.70]  what a
[2008.70 --> 2009.28]  disruptive
[2009.28 --> 2010.18]  journey
[2010.18 --> 2011.52]  and to
[2011.52 --> 2011.98]  do it
[2011.98 --> 2012.40]  all while
[2012.40 --> 2012.76]  pregnant.
[2014.40 --> 2014.86]  And yet
[2014.86 --> 2015.24]  again
[2015.24 --> 2016.18]  behind the
[2016.18 --> 2016.66]  scenes
[2016.66 --> 2017.30]  God
[2017.30 --> 2018.56]  orchestrated
[2018.56 --> 2019.54]  this Pax Romana
[2019.54 --> 2020.50]  that enabled
[2020.50 --> 2021.18]  the gospel
[2021.18 --> 2022.04]  to spread
[2022.04 --> 2022.78]  after
[2022.78 --> 2023.48]  Pentecost
[2023.48 --> 2024.86]  all over
[2024.86 --> 2025.60]  the ancient
[2025.60 --> 2026.26]  Roman world
[2026.26 --> 2027.22]  bringing the
[2027.22 --> 2027.74]  gospel to
[2027.74 --> 2028.66]  many different
[2028.66 --> 2029.28]  peoples
[2029.28 --> 2030.42]  and cultures.
[2032.02 --> 2032.78]  Friends
[2032.78 --> 2033.52]  Christmas is a
[2033.52 --> 2034.12]  time of two
[2034.12 --> 2034.58]  stories.
[2035.34 --> 2036.08]  The big
[2036.08 --> 2036.70]  story is
[2036.70 --> 2037.24]  grabbing all
[2037.24 --> 2037.74]  the headlines
[2037.74 --> 2039.48]  but the
[2039.48 --> 2040.34]  small story
[2040.34 --> 2040.86]  that's often
[2040.86 --> 2041.54]  unseen
[2041.54 --> 2042.68]  and unnoticed
[2042.68 --> 2044.24]  but that is
[2044.24 --> 2044.86]  changing the
[2044.86 --> 2045.16]  world.
[2045.16 --> 2047.54]  And so
[2047.54 --> 2048.22]  we go on
[2048.22 --> 2049.04]  in the
[2049.04 --> 2049.36]  story
[2049.36 --> 2049.62]  and we
[2049.62 --> 2049.92]  read
[2049.92 --> 2052.46]  while they
[2052.46 --> 2052.94]  were there
[2052.94 --> 2053.46]  the time
[2053.46 --> 2054.10]  came for
[2054.10 --> 2054.64]  the baby
[2054.64 --> 2055.36]  to be
[2055.36 --> 2055.66]  born
[2055.66 --> 2057.22]  and she
[2057.22 --> 2057.90]  gave birth
[2057.90 --> 2058.48]  to her
[2058.48 --> 2059.56]  firstborn
[2059.56 --> 2060.14]  a son.
[2060.82 --> 2061.56]  She wrapped
[2061.56 --> 2061.84]  him in
[2061.84 --> 2062.24]  cloths
[2062.24 --> 2062.64]  and placed
[2062.64 --> 2062.88]  him in
[2062.88 --> 2063.24]  a manger
[2063.24 --> 2064.34]  because
[2064.34 --> 2065.10]  there was
[2065.10 --> 2065.74]  no guest
[2065.74 --> 2066.06]  room
[2066.06 --> 2067.12]  available
[2067.12 --> 2068.18]  for them.
[2070.08 --> 2071.24]  The story
[2071.24 --> 2071.82]  of Jesus
[2071.82 --> 2072.62]  began
[2072.62 --> 2074.78]  so modestly
[2074.78 --> 2077.10]  a simple
[2077.10 --> 2077.76]  couple
[2077.76 --> 2079.58]  from a
[2079.58 --> 2080.58]  small town
[2080.58 --> 2082.16]  on a
[2082.16 --> 2082.60]  dangerous
[2082.60 --> 2083.16]  journey
[2083.16 --> 2084.66]  preparing
[2084.66 --> 2085.40]  to give
[2085.40 --> 2086.06]  birth to
[2086.06 --> 2086.76]  their child
[2086.76 --> 2088.10]  placed in
[2088.10 --> 2088.58]  a manger
[2088.58 --> 2090.82]  a feeding
[2090.82 --> 2091.34]  trough
[2091.34 --> 2092.20]  for animals
[2092.20 --> 2093.52]  wrapped in
[2093.52 --> 2094.20]  some cloths
[2094.20 --> 2094.74]  whatever they
[2094.74 --> 2095.40]  could find.
[2096.52 --> 2097.76]  This story
[2097.76 --> 2098.68]  wouldn't have
[2098.68 --> 2099.64]  even made
[2099.64 --> 2100.42]  the local
[2100.42 --> 2100.88]  news.
[2102.10 --> 2103.42]  Yet this
[2103.42 --> 2104.46]  small story
[2104.46 --> 2104.84]  is the
[2104.84 --> 2105.40]  story that
[2105.40 --> 2105.72]  changed
[2105.72 --> 2106.14]  the world.
[2107.08 --> 2107.48]  This is
[2107.48 --> 2107.96]  the story
[2107.96 --> 2108.54]  of God
[2108.54 --> 2109.50]  reaching out
[2109.50 --> 2110.20]  to us
[2110.20 --> 2110.48]  in the
[2110.48 --> 2110.80]  midst
[2110.80 --> 2111.94]  of all
[2111.94 --> 2112.66]  of our
[2112.66 --> 2113.48]  disruption
[2113.48 --> 2114.08]  and all
[2114.08 --> 2114.34]  of our
[2114.34 --> 2114.78]  chaos
[2114.78 --> 2115.42]  and all
[2115.42 --> 2115.72]  of our
[2115.72 --> 2116.06]  hurts
[2116.06 --> 2116.52]  and all
[2116.52 --> 2116.86]  of our
[2116.86 --> 2117.32]  hopes
[2117.32 --> 2118.76]  in the
[2118.76 --> 2119.02]  midst
[2119.02 --> 2119.34]  of the
[2119.34 --> 2119.90]  big story
[2119.90 --> 2120.22]  that is
[2120.22 --> 2120.56]  grabbing
[2120.56 --> 2121.24]  the headlines.
[2122.52 --> 2123.18]  A census
[2123.18 --> 2123.94]  that disrupted
[2123.94 --> 2124.52]  the entire
[2124.52 --> 2125.00]  world.
[2126.04 --> 2126.68]  A pandemic
[2126.68 --> 2127.44]  that continues
[2127.44 --> 2128.14]  to disrupt
[2128.14 --> 2128.66]  the entire
[2128.66 --> 2129.14]  world.
[2129.14 --> 2132.04]  hopes and
[2132.04 --> 2132.50]  hurts that
[2132.50 --> 2133.06]  every step
[2133.06 --> 2133.38]  of the
[2133.38 --> 2133.74]  way
[2133.74 --> 2134.82]  would be
[2134.82 --> 2135.58]  rehearsed.
[2137.16 --> 2137.76]  Social
[2137.76 --> 2138.58]  isolation
[2138.58 --> 2139.92]  boo
[2139.92 --> 2141.42]  right
[2141.42 --> 2143.14]  distancing
[2143.14 --> 2145.48]  mass
[2145.48 --> 2147.14]  vaccines
[2147.14 --> 2148.96]  working
[2148.96 --> 2149.86]  from home
[2149.86 --> 2151.16]  learning
[2151.16 --> 2151.94]  from home
[2151.94 --> 2153.46]  plans
[2153.46 --> 2154.24]  deferred
[2154.24 --> 2155.66]  maybe never
[2155.66 --> 2156.14]  to be picked
[2156.14 --> 2156.60]  up again.
[2158.34 --> 2158.88]  Challenges
[2158.88 --> 2159.30]  that the
[2159.30 --> 2159.56]  world
[2159.56 --> 2160.60]  has faced
[2160.60 --> 2160.96]  then
[2160.96 --> 2161.78]  and challenges
[2161.78 --> 2162.22]  that the
[2162.22 --> 2162.52]  world
[2162.52 --> 2162.94]  faces
[2162.94 --> 2163.32]  today.
[2164.36 --> 2165.02]  These are
[2165.02 --> 2165.60]  the stories
[2165.60 --> 2166.64]  that grab
[2166.64 --> 2167.50]  the headlines
[2167.50 --> 2169.60]  but God
[2169.60 --> 2170.24]  into
[2170.24 --> 2171.60]  that story
[2171.60 --> 2172.10]  and into
[2172.10 --> 2173.02]  our story
[2173.02 --> 2173.62]  today
[2173.62 --> 2174.60]  spoke
[2174.60 --> 2175.52]  a small
[2175.52 --> 2176.00]  story
[2176.00 --> 2177.56]  that changed
[2177.56 --> 2177.96]  the entire
[2177.96 --> 2178.38]  world
[2178.38 --> 2180.12]  because Christmas
[2180.12 --> 2180.64]  is the
[2180.64 --> 2181.38]  tale of two
[2181.38 --> 2181.82]  stories
[2181.82 --> 2183.40]  and when
[2183.40 --> 2183.76]  events
[2183.76 --> 2184.24]  these past
[2184.24 --> 2184.94]  18 months
[2184.94 --> 2185.60]  just kind
[2185.60 --> 2185.88]  of seem
[2185.88 --> 2186.56]  to swallow
[2186.56 --> 2187.18]  us up
[2187.18 --> 2187.96]  and to
[2187.96 --> 2188.34]  weave a
[2188.34 --> 2188.76]  tale that
[2188.76 --> 2189.20]  is so
[2189.20 --> 2190.20]  confusing
[2190.20 --> 2191.56]  and so
[2191.56 --> 2192.04]  chaotic
[2192.04 --> 2194.10]  we come
[2194.10 --> 2194.84]  into this
[2194.84 --> 2195.36]  Christmas
[2195.36 --> 2196.06]  yearning
[2196.06 --> 2196.46]  to hear
[2196.46 --> 2197.08]  this small
[2197.08 --> 2197.54]  story
[2197.54 --> 2198.18]  of a
[2198.18 --> 2198.58]  baby
[2198.58 --> 2199.16]  born
[2199.16 --> 2199.88]  2,000
[2199.88 --> 2200.56]  years ago
[2200.56 --> 2201.76]  in another
[2201.76 --> 2202.36]  part of the
[2202.36 --> 2202.66]  world
[2202.66 --> 2203.82]  that wouldn't
[2203.82 --> 2204.40]  even have
[2204.40 --> 2204.74]  made the
[2204.74 --> 2205.36]  local news
[2205.36 --> 2207.12]  but it's a
[2207.12 --> 2207.98]  story that
[2207.98 --> 2208.72]  was declared
[2208.72 --> 2209.48]  by the
[2209.48 --> 2209.98]  angels
[2209.98 --> 2211.02]  of heaven
[2211.02 --> 2212.14]  to a
[2212.14 --> 2212.68]  group of

[2217.98 --> 2218.84]  for all

[2249.90 --> 2250.24]  that are

[2251.20 --> 2251.58]  and grabbing

[2252.14 --> 2253.34]  would this
[2253.34 --> 2254.16]  small story
