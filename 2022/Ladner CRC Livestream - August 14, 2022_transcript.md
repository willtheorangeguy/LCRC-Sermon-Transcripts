[2302.24 --> 2303.24]  Thank you.
[2331.58 --> 2332.24]  You I'm sons of
[2332.24 --> 2338.24]  I'múlt通ара Metroid.
[2338.24 --> 2341.28]  And you cut you today.
[2341.28 --> 2341.86]  I think you boys see.
[2341.86 --> 2342.24]  Thank you.
[2342.24 --> 2348.82]  You know what »s told me.
[2348.82 --> 2356.78]  with some real hard stuff, and for some more than others, it seems, and more often.
[2358.44 --> 2364.42]  Life, and one of the things I've thought about in this is, I used to think when I was younger
[2364.42 --> 2371.40]  that, you know, by the time you get old, I mean, faith's just easy then, right?
[2372.18 --> 2373.92]  You've been doing it all those years.
[2375.70 --> 2377.12]  It's not true.
[2377.12 --> 2379.98]  It isn't, seriously.
[2380.54 --> 2387.12]  The bumps and the bruises don't make life and faith easier.
[2387.42 --> 2389.18]  In some ways, it's more challenging.
[2391.34 --> 2395.40]  Faith doesn't necessarily get easier, and if you think about some examples, I was thinking
[2395.40 --> 2400.10]  about the example of King Solomon, one of the classic stories, right?
[2400.10 --> 2406.86]  King Solomon, who we're told by 1 Kings 11, the beginning of 1 Kings is all about Solomon
[2406.86 --> 2413.22]  and the building of the temple and all these magnificent things that happen to and through
[2413.22 --> 2418.72]  Solomon, including he has two visions from the Lord.
[2418.72 --> 2419.72]  God.
[2419.72 --> 2432.52]  And yet, by 1 Kings 11, we're told his heart drifts away from God because of marriages and being
[2432.52 --> 2434.22]  drawn away to other gods.
[2434.22 --> 2435.22]  God.
[2435.22 --> 2440.58]  His heart was not wholly dedicated to his God in his old age.
[2440.58 --> 2441.58]  God's love.
[2441.58 --> 2451.30]  And the challenge that age, aging presents, I just think of Jesus' words when the Son of
[2451.30 --> 2452.22]  Man returns.
[2452.22 --> 2461.58]  will he find faith on the earth over time will he or you think of the letter to the angel of
[2461.58 --> 2468.30]  the church at ephesus you know you've lost your first love it happens all too easily
[2470.14 --> 2477.02]  these enemies come at us whatever of whatever nature whatever sort life bombards us so what
[2477.02 --> 2484.38]  does the psalmist do in that regard how does he how does he deal with the challenges and i think he
[2484.38 --> 2490.62]  does a few things we'll just look at those at least there's probably more but one of the things that
[2490.62 --> 2500.94]  the psalmist reflects in this psalm that i i read as i read it is he reflects on his total dependence
[2500.94 --> 2509.58]  on god his complete reliance on god did you notice how often he says on you alone lord you alone
[2511.74 --> 2519.18]  completely reliant now that's a common theme again all through the psalms this idea of reliance and
[2519.18 --> 2526.14]  these metaphors that come up you're my rock you're my refuge you're my fortress you know you've heard
[2526.14 --> 2532.14]  these terms come up over and over again in fact if you look at this psalm the opening few verses
[2532.14 --> 2539.74]  they're almost identical to the opening verses of psalm 31. it's almost almost exactly they're very
[2539.74 --> 2546.86]  very close and so these are these are common themes but again that's what he's reflecting on that he he is
[2546.86 --> 2561.66]  totally dependent on god alone to save him through god's profound power which is his only hope and confidence
[2562.86 --> 2572.22]  now a lot of people don't it's not probably not natural to us to want to depend on someone else
[2572.22 --> 2580.14]  right we want to be self-reliant i read a good friend who but he's a complete atheist we've had
[2580.14 --> 2586.94]  we've had long conversations but i remember at one point talking about faith and trusting god and he said
[2586.94 --> 2598.22]  to me directly he said i never want to have a crutch i never want to depend on anyone else i'll stand on my
[2598.22 --> 2608.22]  own i thought well that's easy to say at some times in life but we don't naturally want to depend
[2609.10 --> 2616.46]  watched a movie a while back it was a movie uh stars andrew garfield and the name of the movie is breathe
[2617.90 --> 2625.26]  breathe and it's the story it's based on a true story of an englishman named robin cavendish
[2625.26 --> 2637.98]  and cavendish in the 1950s when he was 28 years old very active adventurous uh individual and he was
[2638.86 --> 2651.34]  full of life at 28 he was struck down by polio and ended up in hospital in a bed on an iron lung
[2651.34 --> 2662.30]  a breathing apparatus completely helpless and all he can do is move his head a little bit and he can
[2662.30 --> 2670.54]  sort of talk and make facial expressions that's it now cavendish the reason there's a movie about him
[2670.54 --> 2676.70]  is because he became an advocate for disability people with disabilities and he developed well with his
[2676.70 --> 2682.46]  friends with the support of his friends which he always relied on uh they developed a wheelchair
[2682.46 --> 2687.26]  that had a breathing apparatus so he could get up and go around and he does all these adventurous times
[2687.26 --> 2693.74]  and and there's a comedic parts where you know he's out uh they have to transfer him from bed to to
[2693.74 --> 2700.70]  somewhere else and and in the middle somebody's using uh fireplace bellows to and and and he says oh
[2700.70 --> 2708.78]  you're getting excited slow down i'm not a balloon you know i i do blow up and and uh but but he you
[2708.78 --> 2714.62]  know he becomes this this uh this advocate for disabilities but one of the things that struck me in
[2714.62 --> 2730.06]  that was how totally dependent he was on for everything he could do nothing he couldn't even breathe
[2730.86 --> 2741.82]  on his own now there's not very often it's not very often that we realize just how dependent we are
[2743.18 --> 2754.22]  as human beings we can feel really self-reliant but the reality is we are entirely dependent
[2754.22 --> 2766.30]  and we would confess on god the creator for our very breath we really can do nothing apart from him
[2767.50 --> 2777.02]  the psalmist is totally dependent the second thing he does in this psalm is he focuses on one of the
[2777.02 --> 2780.86]  things he focuses on he focuses on a lot of things but one of the things he really highlights is
[2780.86 --> 2792.78]  god's righteousness the term your righteousness is repeated five times through this psalm it's repeated
[2792.78 --> 2802.94]  once in verse two it starts in verse two in your righteousness rescue me and deliver me then in verse
[2802.94 --> 2812.62]  verse 15 my mouth will tell of your and literally in the hebrew it's your righteousness the niv says your
[2812.62 --> 2820.14]  righteous deeds of your saving acts all day long 16 i will come and proclaim your mighty acts sovereign
[2820.14 --> 2825.90]  lord i will proclaim your again righteous deeds but literally it's your righteousness
[2825.90 --> 2837.98]  verse 19 your righteousness god reaches to the heavens you who have done great things who is like you god
[2837.98 --> 2848.62]  and then verse 24 my tongue will tell of your again righteous acts your righteous acts literally your
[2848.62 --> 2855.02]  righteousness it's the same tzedakah is the the hebrew word your righteousness all the day long
[2856.70 --> 2865.10]  and and it um so it's god's saving redeeming acts on behalf of his people now again this theme of god's
[2865.10 --> 2870.06]  righteousness i was trying to think okay what does this have to do what's god's righteousness how does
[2870.06 --> 2875.82]  that what does that mean god's righteousness uh and it comes up several times but one of the times i was
[2875.82 --> 2881.58]  just reading the other day in psalm 40 did we did i get this one to you psalm 40 i think yeah no i
[2882.30 --> 2887.02]  sorry you just i just read through it the other day and i thought oh this is really i'll just read it
[2887.02 --> 2897.74]  verses 9 and 10 of psalm 40 i proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly i think i underlined it
[2897.74 --> 2905.42]  here okay i wrote it here i proclaim and and the word proclaim is i good news as a verb i tell out the
[2905.42 --> 2912.62]  news i tell out the good news of righteousness is literally what the hebrew says in the great assembly
[2912.62 --> 2922.86]  i do not seal my lips lord as you know i do not hide your righteousness same term in my heart i speak
[2922.86 --> 2928.22]  of your faithfulness and your saving help one of the things that struck me here is how often god's
[2928.22 --> 2933.58]  righteousness i mean we tend to think of that as you know righteousness and doing righteous deeds but
[2933.58 --> 2941.90]  it very much is god's work on behalf of his people it's all about his righteousness is always
[2941.90 --> 2951.42]  here tied in with his saving his delivering his rescuing his redeeming his people but it's god
[2951.42 --> 2960.38]  working on behalf of his people his righteousness is is active he's at work for us and the psalmist
[2960.38 --> 2970.78]  is reflecting on that particularly in verse 24 of psalm 71 again my tongue the english says will tell
[2970.78 --> 2978.62]  of your righteousness all day long but what it literally says is my tongue
[2981.42 --> 2992.30]  will and then the word isn't tell the word is literally will meditate on your righteousness all the
[2992.30 --> 3000.46]  day my tongue will it's the same word as is is in psalm one the about the righteousness of the
[3000.46 --> 3009.10]  righteous man and on your law he meditates day and night so it's got this idea of meditation but it
[3009.10 --> 3021.98]  sometimes has the sense of to moan or groan isaiah in isaiah 31 talks of the lord speaking he says i'm like
[3022.70 --> 3027.58]  or he says he's talking about the lord he says he's like the lion who
[3029.98 --> 3037.26]  and and i think the depends on the translation but he's like he growls he moans over his prey
[3038.14 --> 3043.74]  is the lord coming in his righteousness to rescue his people he's like this this lion
[3043.74 --> 3052.54]  the lion growling but it's uh eugene peterson uses the the the metaphor the picture of a dog with a bone
[3053.26 --> 3062.06]  you know but he's he's really focusing on it getting everything he can but just working it and kind of
[3062.06 --> 3071.18]  moaning in the midst of it so when i translated this i i said my tongue all the day will meditatively
[3071.18 --> 3080.46]  moan of your righteousness i just dwell on it and i i moan i meditate but i i'm also kind of
[3081.42 --> 3092.94]  growling over it in this savoring sort of way god's righteousness now think about that in terms of
[3092.94 --> 3099.82]  as you go on because this idea of god's righteousness comes up repeatedly throughout
[3099.82 --> 3104.86]  the scriptures one verse i think you do have is isaiah 46
[3107.18 --> 3114.94]  isaiah 46 verses 12 to 13 this is in the context of the exile now listen to me you stubborn of heart
[3114.94 --> 3123.82]  you who are far from righteousness speaking to the people i bring near my righteousness this is god
[3123.82 --> 3135.66]  speaking it is not far off and salvation will not delay i will put salvation in zion for israel my glory
[3135.66 --> 3148.62]  god says i'll step in with my righteousness now again the context there is the the exile the immediate
[3148.62 --> 3158.46]  context but if we think now forward to the new testament and another text in romans chapter 3
[3158.46 --> 3168.38]  again the righteousness of god but now apart from the law the righteousness of god has been made known
[3168.38 --> 3177.42]  to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness is given through faith in jesus christ
[3177.42 --> 3181.82]  to all who believe there is no difference between jew and gentile for all have sinned and fall short of
[3181.82 --> 3188.54]  the glory of the glory of god and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came
[3188.54 --> 3201.42]  by christ jesus god's righteousness revealed in jesus and then given to us and how that that that jesus fulfills
[3202.38 --> 3211.66]  in such a fuller way god's salvation plan god's righteousness coming in and and saving saving his people
[3212.22 --> 3220.38]  what a beautiful picture and so the psalmist here is reflecting on on god's righteousness and and we can
[3220.38 --> 3231.34]  reflect on it even more fully because in jesus christ oh my goodness god's righteousness revealed for us his people
[3235.66 --> 3241.66]  so he reflects on his dependence he reflects on god's righteousness and then i think overall
[3241.66 --> 3253.02]  you know we talked about aging is kind of tough but it's also there's a profound blessing in walking
[3253.02 --> 3263.02]  through life with god there is a blessing in and i i recognize that not everybody has this experience and
[3263.02 --> 3268.70]  some come to faith later and it's but it's all part of the maturing process but when you have that history
[3268.70 --> 3275.34]  of walking with god and seeing his faithfulness all through life when we come to those
[3276.94 --> 3282.30]  down times those challenges those enemies those difficulties
[3282.30 --> 3294.38]  looking back at god's faithfulness reflecting on that is a is a hope-filling experience that that enables us
[3294.38 --> 3296.70]  in confidence to press on
[3296.70 --> 3301.10]  the psalmist to be the psalmist to be the psalmist to be the psalmist to be the psalmist
[3301.10 --> 3310.54]  the psalmist here is constantly reminding himself of god's goodness the words come up we won't get into it
[3310.54 --> 3317.58]  because i don't think we have the time but he talks continually and all the day long and always and ever he says
[3317.58 --> 3324.86]  i'm i'm reminding myself of this because god has been faithful from birth on and he knows he will
[3324.86 --> 3331.42]  continue to do so and i was just thinking of that in terms of you know i when we got into the council
[3331.42 --> 3337.10]  room in the back we're gonna have prayer and joe says to me hey gary good to have you back it must feel
[3337.10 --> 3345.66]  a bit like coming home doesn't it i thought wow it really does we've we've kind of been walking with
[3345.66 --> 3354.14]  you guys a long time it's coming up to 30 years and just it is a bit like coming home in fact i'll
[3354.14 --> 3359.18]  be i'm gonna tell you a little secret here when i first i was reading this song i thought i'm gonna
[3359.18 --> 3365.58]  preach on this psalm some sometime this was like a few years ago and i thought you know what i'm gonna
[3365.58 --> 3373.18]  preach on this psalm when i turn 60 and i'm gonna preach it at ladner crc that's what i said to myself
[3373.18 --> 3379.90]  literally now i missed it by a year i'm 61. covet we'll blame that on covet but i said and that was
[3379.90 --> 3385.50]  the first thought that came to mind i want to preach it when i turn 60 when i'm 60 or or so and i want to
[3385.50 --> 3394.22]  preach it at ladner crc because we've walked through life quite a while quite a long time i think it helps
[3394.22 --> 3398.54]  that i didn't come as your pastor i just came as one of the parishioners you know let's keep it that
[3398.54 --> 3406.46]  way no no no we're friends right but it's it's uh it's been this walk and we've done it sort of
[3406.46 --> 3412.54]  together we've come and gone as you know we come we're in and out and going here and there but still
[3412.54 --> 3419.90]  we always come back and it's just like sort of like it's like an old friend right when you you know
[3419.90 --> 3429.34]  this friend this faithful friend all through the years it's really good it's just good these those
[3429.34 --> 3435.50]  friends are like an old shoe well maybe not quite like an old shoe you know take it right away but
[3436.30 --> 3444.86]  it it's it fits it's comfortable it's good i i or the other example i like is it's like a good marriage
[3444.86 --> 3451.02]  and i don't want to make light of the fact that not all marriages work out and they're not always
[3451.02 --> 3457.66]  necessarily good but and there are always challenges but when when a marriage is good it's like it's just
[3458.30 --> 3465.90]  you have those years you know each other like when you first get married remember think back when you
[3465.90 --> 3473.18]  first get married it's really exciting it's also a little terrifying isn't it because who is this person
[3473.18 --> 3482.38]  i'm getting married too and you know jennifer is is she a covert international spy i know and you know
[3482.38 --> 3490.38]  what honestly i still can't categorically prove that she isn't but i'm really confident that she isn't
[3490.38 --> 3497.82]  i know who she is right and she's faithful and she's true and she's loving and we've walked for 30 plus
[3497.82 --> 3509.74]  years and it's been a huge blessing and that's that's just a human picture of this walk with god
[3510.46 --> 3517.74]  all through life and and you know when god this is why it's so challenging friends for the jewish people
[3518.86 --> 3520.30]  dealing with the holocaust
[3520.30 --> 3529.26]  because it feels it can feel very much like being forsaken by god or when someone does have those
[3529.26 --> 3535.50]  feelings of forsakenness and that's why it's important that we we remember back we hearken back
[3535.50 --> 3545.66]  to those times of god's faithfulness in our lives in our midst as a community in history in jesus
[3545.66 --> 3557.74]  and we look back at that time and time only confirms the choice i i love the phrase you've probably heard
[3557.74 --> 3565.34]  it before again eugene peterson when he he one of his books he entitles it's a quote from nietzsche
[3565.34 --> 3574.14]  a long obedience in the same direction always moving in that direction and and that builds that is a
[3574.14 --> 3580.62]  blessing it's a profound blessing aging has its challenges but it also has its blessings
[3582.22 --> 3591.26]  because we have the history especially with god now i was trying to get another graphic i did it come

[3621.82 --> 3632.22]  my hope i will always have hope and what this psalm underscores more than anything is that sense
[3633.34 --> 3646.62]  of hope hope hope in the risen lord hope in the faithful god who holds us would you bow with me in
[3646.62 --> 3655.90]  prayer father thank you for the hope you give because of your righteousness your righteous acts and deeds

[3839.36 --> 3846.32]  For by my side the Savior he will stay
[3846.32 --> 3852.58]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing
[3852.58 --> 3858.32]  For in my need his power is to stay
[3858.32 --> 3865.28]  To this I hope, my shepherd will defend me
[3865.28 --> 3872.28]  For the deepest valley he will lead
[3872.28 --> 3875.86]  Oh, the night has been won
[3875.86 --> 3878.32]  And I shall overcome
[3878.32 --> 3885.28]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me

[3897.58 --> 3903.32]  A future should, a price to grasp and pay
[3903.32 --> 3910.28]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[3910.28 --> 3917.24]  And he was raised to overflow the grave
[3917.24 --> 3924.20]  To this I hope, my sin has been defeated
[3924.20 --> 3926.74]  Jesus now and ever, Jesus now and ever
[3926.74 --> 3929.16]  And ever is my plea
[3929.16 --> 3933.16]  All the chains are released

[3942.20 --> 3955.16]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[3955.16 --> 3961.16]  For he has said that he will bring me home
[3961.16 --> 3968.16]  And day by day I know he will renew me
[3968.16 --> 3974.12]  Until I stand with joy before the throne

[4035.58 --> 4039.38]  And the offering this morning is for our Christian Education Fund,
[4039.38 --> 4044.58]  which has been used to sponsor youth for short-term missions.
[4045.14 --> 4048.44]  That fund is available to those in our church.

[4167.46 --> 4179.46]  Before we have our community prayer, I'd like to invite Vahid, Benez, and their family up.
[4179.46 --> 4185.46]  If you remember, we, Vahid and Benez, come on up.
[4185.46 --> 4191.46]  Our church sponsored them and they arrived in Canada about a year and a half ago, December of 2020.
[4191.46 --> 4195.46]  So they've been with us for a while and they just wanted to say a few words.
[4195.46 --> 4198.46]  Is Violet coming as well?
[4198.46 --> 4199.46]  Yeah.
[4199.46 --> 4206.46]  So, Violet, Vahid's going to speak in Farsi and then Violet's going to translate.
[4206.46 --> 4210.46]  And Vahid's English is just fine.
[4210.46 --> 4220.46]  So I asked him why and he said, well, there's family and friends of theirs in Turkey and in Iran who are watching our service.
[4220.46 --> 4228.46]  Thank you.

[4370.46 --> 4380.46]  And thank God because you give a beautiful family in the church to us.
[4380.46 --> 4391.46]  To the place that we don't know and don't know anybody here.
[4391.46 --> 4398.46]  They help us and support us with kindness and.
[4398.46 --> 4401.46]  And, and not.
[4401.46 --> 4403.46]  Okay, continue.
[4405.46 --> 4418.46]  Thank you God that you give your son in your Christ and give his body to us.
[4418.46 --> 4433.46]  And, and we have a new life here.
[4433.46 --> 4448.46]  Thank you for everyone.

[4545.46 --> 4546.46]  Amen.

[4595.46 --> 4608.46]  Thank you so much for your time and take your time to listen to me.
[4625.46 --> 4630.46]  Thank you, Vahid and Benez and family and Violet.
[4632.46 --> 4637.46]  This time we'll ask you to join in our community prayer.
[4637.46 --> 4641.46]  And the opening line in the prayer is from Psalm 5.
[4641.46 --> 4643.46]  Let's pray.
[4643.46 --> 4646.46]  We pray to you, O Lord, you hear our voice in the morning.
[4646.46 --> 4650.46]  At sunrise we offer our prayers and wait for your answer.
[4650.46 --> 4653.46]  Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[4653.46 --> 4658.46]  You created us in your image and you're yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[4658.46 --> 4664.46]  We are thankful for the communities we live in, for the services we sometimes take for granted,
[4664.46 --> 4677.46]  for clean water, for public servants such as police, doctors, judges, nurses, firefighters, military personnel and paramedics, among others.
[4677.46 --> 4680.46]  May we be mindful of all these services we have.
[4680.46 --> 4685.46]  Bless all workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[4685.46 --> 4691.46]  We pray for those who work in agriculture, including farmers in our own church,
[4691.46 --> 4696.46]  for a continued good growing season and the weather to bring in the crops.
[4696.46 --> 4700.46]  We pray for our nation, for our Prime Minister, our Premier,
[4700.46 --> 4705.46]  and the mayors from the communities we represent, Delta and Richmond.
[4705.46 --> 4710.46]  Give them a sense of justice and provide them with wisdom for leadership.
[4710.46 --> 4714.46]  We pray for a broken world, for Christians around this world,
[4714.46 --> 4720.46]  we want to especially remember Christians in the country of Iran.
[4720.46 --> 4722.46]  Protect your church there.
[4722.46 --> 4729.46]  We pray for a change of heart in the leadership of Iran to give more freedom to Christian believers.
[4729.46 --> 4735.46]  We thank you for these words we heard this morning from Vahid about the church in Iran.
[4735.46 --> 4743.46]  And we thank you that we have had the opportunity to get to know Vahid and Banez and Abbas and Violet
[4743.46 --> 4747.46]  and Mustafa and Fahou and their families.
[4747.46 --> 4750.46]  And obviously their concern for the church in Iran.
[4750.46 --> 4752.46]  We ask you to be with them.
[4752.46 --> 4755.46]  And may we keep them in your prayers.
[4755.46 --> 4763.46]  We also pray for believers in Ethiopia and Nigeria and bless your church in these countries.
[4763.46 --> 4772.46]  And just this morning, just recently we heard in the news about a terrible fire in Cairo in a church where over 40 persons died.
[4772.46 --> 4778.46]  And we pray for comfort for this community and the families of those affected.
[4778.46 --> 4782.46]  Very much in our hearts is the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
[4782.46 --> 4787.46]  We see the images in the media and our hearts go out to all those who are uprooted,
[4787.46 --> 4791.46]  millions who have fled their homes and have become refugees.
[4791.46 --> 4796.46]  We pray for those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[4796.46 --> 4801.46]  Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating this violence to bring it to an end.
[4801.46 --> 4808.46]  Bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable problems, conflicts.
[4808.46 --> 4814.46]  We pray for the nations as we see our rise in authoritarian power in many countries.
[4814.46 --> 4821.46]  Afghanistan has dropped off the front page news, but there is still a crisis happening there.
[4821.46 --> 4824.46]  Protect those who were promised to exit from that country.
[4824.46 --> 4834.46]  And bless our government who are working on trying to fulfill a promise of bringing those who had worked with our Canadian military.
[4834.46 --> 4837.46]  And we pray that these families may come out safely.
[4837.46 --> 4840.46]  We pray for our church.
[4840.46 --> 4847.46]  Bless our ministry leaders for Pastor Jason, Associate Pastor Nancy, and our children's coordinator Hannah.
[4847.46 --> 4849.46]  We ask for a blessing.
[4849.46 --> 4853.46]  On basic skills this week, we are thankful for all those who are leading this camp.
[4853.46 --> 4859.46]  We pray that the camp may be used to introduce the gospel to those who have not yet heard.
[4859.46 --> 4864.46]  Keep all 55 children and leaders safe during this week.
[4864.46 --> 4868.46]  Continue to bless the work of Pastor Nancy and the Chinese ministry.
[4868.46 --> 4874.46]  May we continue to grow together so that we can become one body, getting to know each other better.
[4874.46 --> 4879.46]  We pray for the ministries of our CRC denomination and our classes.
[4879.46 --> 4883.46]  In particular, we want to pray for the ministry to seafarers.
[4883.46 --> 4887.46]  Bless Gary and the other chaplains as they minister to the seafarers.
[4887.46 --> 4896.46]  The past few years have been very difficult for seafarers, having to be away from home with difficult working situations for up to a year at a time.
[4896.46 --> 4904.46]  We are thankful for this ministry that meets the physical and spiritual needs of the seafarers.
[4904.46 --> 4911.46]  We want to remember and bring before you the needs of our congregation, for those living in care or facing long-term illnesses.
[4911.46 --> 4924.46]  We are thankful for those, for Pat, for Ellie, for Joyce, for Carl, for Grace, for Mark, for Jerry and Anne, for Shirley, for Jeanette, for John and Henry.
[4924.46 --> 4929.48]  And we pray for young Richie Hendrickson as he has had his final chemo treatment.
[4930.18 --> 4932.44]  May his little body be completely healed.
[4933.34 --> 4937.66]  We are thankful with Doug and Nancy Anderson that Doug is feeling much better
[4937.66 --> 4940.14]  and has finished his series of radiation.
[4940.78 --> 4943.02]  We pray for continued healing for Doug.
[4944.10 --> 4948.20]  Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts
[4948.20 --> 4954.24]  like mental illness and depression, addictions, and broken relationships in family
[4954.24 --> 4955.34]  and marriages.
[4956.38 --> 4960.08]  Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name
[4960.08 --> 4963.46]  and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer
[4963.46 --> 4966.72]  and to live faithfully in response to your call.
[4967.36 --> 4969.70]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
[4971.70 --> 4974.38]  So I'll ask Gary to come up for the benediction.
[4985.24 --> 4988.58]  And I'll ask you to rise to receive God's parting blessing.
[4988.82 --> 4993.66]  Now I made one little mistake before the service.
[4993.88 --> 4998.56]  Bev told me to say the right words after I read the scripture.
[4999.38 --> 5001.86]  And but it's not too late.
[5002.06 --> 5002.38]  Okay.
[5002.54 --> 5007.00]  So you all know what to say because we've been reflecting on God's word.
[5007.46 --> 5008.78]  This is the word of the Lord.
[5009.38 --> 5010.52]  Thanks be to God.
[5010.52 --> 5012.54]  We're going to their place for lunch afterwards.
[5012.62 --> 5013.64]  I want to make sure I get fed.
[5015.90 --> 5018.72]  But it has been good to hear, to receive God's word.
[5018.88 --> 5022.34]  Would you hear, receive these parting words of blessing.
[5023.42 --> 5025.46]  We've already in some ways been blessed.
[5025.46 --> 5029.32]  Thank you for Vahid sharing that and giving the blessing.
[5029.44 --> 5031.22]  But hear these words as well.
[5031.88 --> 5036.96]  And the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ.
[5036.96 --> 5040.24]  After you have suffered a little while.
[5040.66 --> 5047.36]  Will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.
[5047.88 --> 5050.40]  To him be the power forever and ever.
[5050.96 --> 5051.34]  Amen.
[5051.34 --> 5051.48]  Amen.
[5051.48 --> 5051.52]  Amen.
[5051.52 --> 5051.54]  Amen.
[5066.96 --> 5069.72]  Amen.
[5069.72 --> 5069.74]  Amen.
[5069.74 --> 5069.96]  Amen.
[5069.96 --> 5070.32]  Amen.
[5070.78 --> 5071.14]  Amen.
[5071.14 --> 5071.96]  Amen.
[5071.96 --> 5073.20]  Amen.
