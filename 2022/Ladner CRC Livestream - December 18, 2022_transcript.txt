[270.00 --> 281.70]  There are a few announcements today before we get started in our time of worship, and that is, for one, this Saturday we have our Christmas Eve service.
[281.82 --> 285.82]  And so that is Saturday, Christmas Eve, at 6.30.
[286.24 --> 287.06]  Is that right?
[287.82 --> 288.06]  Okay.
[289.44 --> 291.48]  I felt like it should be 7, but it's 6.30.
[292.56 --> 295.98]  So that will be here, and that will be Christmas Eve.
[295.98 --> 302.56]  And then also we do have a regular Christmas Sunday worship service on Sunday.
[303.16 --> 306.54]  And so we also have these invitation cards that are out on the foyer table.
[306.96 --> 313.96]  So this is an amazing opportunity to welcome friends and family to come along, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
[314.24 --> 322.36]  So please do consider picking up those cards, thinking, praying about who you could invite to come to church, to come and know God.
[323.64 --> 324.90]  A few other announcements.
[324.90 --> 331.64]  In your bulletin, you will see an announcement about the Gloria Day Chorale concert.
[332.26 --> 334.92]  There was one last night, which I hear was a great success.
[335.30 --> 336.54]  The one tonight has been canceled.
[337.06 --> 342.22]  So if you were saving it for tonight, I'm sorry, but the one tonight is canceled because of the snow.
[342.22 --> 357.28]  And lastly, I wanted to just encourage everyone, as we head into this week before Christmas, it's a good time to consider kind of reengaging and spending some more time with God in his word.
[357.40 --> 359.66]  And so we have these today devotionals.
[359.72 --> 361.40]  Many of you are very familiar with these.
[361.40 --> 368.28]  So this is a little scripture verse that you can read and it has a devotional and these are available on the table and there's one for each day.
[368.28 --> 376.54]  And we also have just a Bible reading plan where every day it can tell you what, you know, you could read and we can do it together.
[376.70 --> 378.60]  So you can read along in the Bible with us.
[378.60 --> 381.00]  So both of these are available on the foyer table.
[388.62 --> 397.78]  So let's join together now in here God's gracious invitation to know him and to worship him.
[398.04 --> 405.16]  Our call to worship today comes from Luke chapter 2, verses 13 to 14, a familiar passage.
[405.80 --> 407.52]  So let us say this together.
[408.60 --> 410.24]  Peace be with you.
[410.94 --> 412.36]  And also with you.
[413.16 --> 420.58]  Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
[421.50 --> 429.92]  Glory to God in the highest heaven and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[430.68 --> 432.12]  Would you please join me in prayer?
[432.12 --> 439.98]  Lord God, we remember the king of glory who came.
[440.76 --> 447.08]  And we look and we wait with hope that the same king of glory, we are waiting for him to come again.
[447.08 --> 454.44]  And we wait for him to reveal that glory to all of creation and to make all things right.
[455.40 --> 458.30]  So Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, meet with us this morning.
[459.04 --> 462.30]  Help us to worship you with glad and believing hearts.
[462.30 --> 465.36]  Father, would you fill our hearts.
[465.36 --> 475.34]  Would you open our ears and our eyes to see and save your Jesus, the seed who crushed the serpent's head and the alpha and omega.
[475.34 --> 478.86]  It is in and through his name that we pray.
[479.52 --> 479.94]  Amen.
[480.80 --> 486.32]  Brothers and sisters, please stand for God's greeting to us comes from Isaiah chapter 40.
[486.32 --> 494.98]  See, the sovereign Lord comes with power and he rules with a mighty arm.
[495.92 --> 497.84]  He tends his flock like a shepherd.
[498.70 --> 504.14]  He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart.
[505.26 --> 508.22]  Would you turn and would you greet those around you?
[508.70 --> 510.60]  In the name of Christ and then we will sing together.
[510.60 --> 511.16]  Amen.

[864.70 --> 887.24]  Today is the fourth Sunday of Advent, and on this day we light the fourth candle in our Advent wreath, the candle of love.
[887.24 --> 897.64]  God's steadfast love has been made known to us through his Son, Jesus Christ, who laid down his life for all people.
[898.58 --> 911.24]  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son to the end that all that believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[911.24 --> 919.34]  We cannot comprehend how vast, high, deep, and wide is the love of God.
[920.84 --> 923.90]  Restore us, O Lord God of hosts.
[925.22 --> 929.74]  Show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
[941.24 --> 946.52]  Ever-loving God, you made in us your image.
[947.58 --> 951.82]  You made us in your image, and you have called us to be your people, marked by your love.

[959.34 --> 962.76]  that the world might know your vast and unrelenting love.
[963.62 --> 964.04]  Amen.

[1023.32 --> 1030.22]  O come, O come, Emmanuel
[1030.22 --> 1042.58]  Can you hear the angels sing?
[1042.58 --> 1051.52]  Long, long, to the Lord of the Lord
[1051.52 --> 1062.86]  Long, to the Lord of the Lord is here
[1062.86 --> 1069.84]  The drought breaks within tears of my love
[1069.84 --> 1073.96]  A baby's cry is the sound of love
[1073.96 --> 1079.84]  Come down, come down, Emmanuel
[1079.84 --> 1087.28]  He is the song for the suffering
[1087.28 --> 1092.18]  He is the Messiah, the Prince of Peace
[1092.18 --> 1099.62]  Has come, He has come, Emmanuel
[1099.62 --> 1110.06]  No glory to the Lord of the Lord
[1110.06 --> 1119.06]  No glory to the Lord of the Lord
[1119.06 --> 1127.50]  No glory to the Lord of the Lord
[1127.50 --> 1136.50]  No glory to the Lord of the Lord
[1136.50 --> 1140.94]  The world waits for a miracle
[1140.94 --> 1145.94]  And heartthomes for a little bit of hope
[1145.94 --> 1151.94]  O come, O come, Emmanuel
[1151.94 --> 1169.24]  So we began this morning singing the song, Come Ali Faithful
[1169.24 --> 1173.92]  There's another hymn that I love called, Come Ye Sinners
[1173.92 --> 1175.64]  This is what it says
[1175.64 --> 1180.36]  Come ye sinners, poor and needy
[1180.36 --> 1184.52]  Weak and wounded, sick and sore
[1184.52 --> 1188.12]  Jesus ready stands to save you
[1188.12 --> 1192.68]  Full of pity, love and power
[1192.68 --> 1195.50]  Friends, that is the good news of Christmas
[1195.50 --> 1197.68]  That is the good news of the gospel
[1197.68 --> 1201.52]  That we don't come to church pretending to be good and religious
[1201.52 --> 1207.06]  Putting our best selves forward so that God would receive us
[1207.06 --> 1208.98]  But we come as we are
[1208.98 --> 1213.94]  We come with all of our pain, our brokenness, our neediness
[1213.94 --> 1219.10]  And God is here to receive us in kindness
[1219.10 --> 1222.62]  With his mercy, with his grace
[1222.62 --> 1225.84]  So now as we come to this time of confession
[1225.84 --> 1227.94]  Let's be honest with ourselves before God
[1227.94 --> 1233.24]  Trusting that he receives us in love because of his son Jesus Christ
[1233.24 --> 1237.24]  And for our words of confession today
[1237.24 --> 1238.20]  Our prayer of confession
[1238.20 --> 1240.18]  We will be using Psalm 51
[1240.18 --> 1243.52]  This was written by David
[1243.52 --> 1246.56]  When the prophet Nathan came to him
[1246.56 --> 1250.16]  After David had committed adultery with Bathsheba
[1250.16 --> 1252.46]  Let's pray this together
[1252.46 --> 1253.44]  I'll begin
[1253.44 --> 1257.10]  Have mercy on me, O God
[1257.10 --> 1259.74]  According to your unfailing love
[1259.74 --> 1262.52]  According to your great compassion
[1262.52 --> 1266.04]  Blot out my transgressions
[1266.04 --> 1268.68]  Wash away all my iniquity
[1268.68 --> 1270.80]  And cleanse me from my sin
[1270.80 --> 1273.38]  For I know my transgressions
[1273.38 --> 1277.16]  And my sin is always before me
[1277.16 --> 1281.24]  Against you, you only have I sinned
[1281.24 --> 1283.56]  And done what is evil in your sight
[1283.56 --> 1285.86]  So you are right in your verdict
[1285.86 --> 1288.92]  And justified when you judge
[1288.92 --> 1290.02]  Please join me
[1290.02 --> 1293.80]  Create in me a pure heart, O God
[1293.80 --> 1297.68]  And renew a steadfast spirit within me
[1297.68 --> 1301.14]  Do not cast me from your presence
[1301.14 --> 1304.40]  Or take your Holy Spirit from me
[1304.40 --> 1308.32]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation
[1308.32 --> 1313.14]  And grant me a willing spirit to sustain me
[1313.14 --> 1314.56]  Let's pray
[1314.56 --> 1319.14]  Lord, we do thank you
[1319.14 --> 1322.54]  That you don't come hiding the worst parts
[1322.54 --> 1324.80]  About ourselves
[1324.80 --> 1326.40]  In order to be approved by you
[1326.40 --> 1328.54]  But Father, we come
[1328.54 --> 1330.86]  Naming the truth about everything
[1330.86 --> 1331.84]  About who we are
[1331.84 --> 1334.26]  Knowing that you receive us
[1334.26 --> 1335.28]  With arms of mercy
[1335.28 --> 1338.60]  So now we come
[1338.60 --> 1340.68]  In the quietness of our own hearts
[1340.68 --> 1341.60]  Lord, before you
[1341.60 --> 1344.92]  Naming those things
[1344.92 --> 1347.26]  We know that we need your help with
[1347.26 --> 1348.78]  Our shame
[1348.78 --> 1350.76]  Our sin
[1350.76 --> 1351.56]  Our guilt
[1351.56 --> 1352.18]  Our bitterness
[1352.18 --> 1352.98]  Our fear
[1352.98 --> 1355.52]  And Father, we come before you
[1355.52 --> 1358.02]  Naming those things to you now
[1358.02 --> 1387.10]  Father, you receive us
[1387.10 --> 1387.96]  For Christ's sake
[1387.96 --> 1389.96]  And we praise you
[1389.96 --> 1390.48]  And thank you
[1390.48 --> 1391.94]  In Jesus' name we pray
[1391.94 --> 1392.74]  Amen
[1392.74 --> 1394.74]  So brothers and sisters
[1394.74 --> 1395.58]  Will you please stand
[1395.58 --> 1397.12]  For these words of assurance
[1397.12 --> 1397.94]  And grace
[1397.94 --> 1400.62]  From John chapter 10
[1400.62 --> 1403.54]  This is what our Lord Jesus says to us
[1403.54 --> 1404.60]  He says
[1404.60 --> 1405.56]  I am the good shepherd
[1405.56 --> 1407.62]  I know my sheep
[1417.96 --> 1418.40]  And thank you
[1418.40 --> 1419.50]  God bless
[1419.50 --> 1419.96]  The Lord Jesus
[1419.96 --> 1435.52]  And he knows
[1435.52 --> 1436.02]  Amen
[1436.02 --> 1436.62]  Peace

[2494.58 --> 2524.58]  Thank you.
[2524.58 --> 2554.56]  Thank you.
[2554.58 --> 2584.58]  Last week.
[2584.58 --> 2614.56]  We don't know.
[2614.56 --> 2644.54]  One thing.
[2644.54 --> 2674.52]  You're in a private place.
[2674.52 --> 2704.52]  David would have known.
[2704.52 --> 2734.50]  Just to get you.
[2734.50 --> 2764.50]  Bathsheba.
[2764.50 --> 2794.48]  She's a heart.
[2794.48 --> 2824.48]  She arrives.
[2824.48 --> 2854.46]  You're in a higher authority.
[2854.46 --> 2884.46]  And it speaks.
[2884.46 --> 2914.46]  And got him.
[2914.46 --> 2944.44]  And it's a man.
[2944.44 --> 2974.44]  And she's taken.
[2974.44 --> 3004.44]  And who now.
[3004.44 --> 3034.42]  God sent you.
[3034.42 --> 3064.40]  And he's a daughter.
[3064.40 --> 3094.38]  And he's a man.
[3094.38 --> 3124.36]  And he's a man.
[3124.36 --> 3154.34]  You know, and maybe as it's a man.
[3154.34 --> 3184.32]  David was a man.
[3184.32 --> 3214.32]  And I think we need to ask.
[3214.32 --> 3244.30]  And he's a man.
[3244.30 --> 3274.30]  Right?
[3274.30 --> 3304.28]  And he's a man.
[3304.28 --> 3334.26]  And he's a man.
[3334.26 --> 3364.24]  And he's a man.
[3364.24 --> 3394.22]  He loves and love.
[3394.22 --> 3398.72]  of the lines that Jesus could have taken to come
[3398.72 --> 3401.98]  throughout the centuries, the generations,
[3401.98 --> 3405.06]  he chose a lineage with sinners
[3405.06 --> 3406.74]  and those who are sinned against,
[3406.74 --> 3409.56]  who are broken shards and who are cracked
[3409.56 --> 3412.94]  to display his grace, right?
[3412.94 --> 3416.16]  Because our God is a master potter
[3417.18 --> 3420.18]  and his specialty is Kintsuji, right?
[3420.18 --> 3425.18]  He doesn't choose to make beautiful pots with perfect clay.
[3425.18 --> 3429.18]  He chooses as his medium broken pieces
[3429.18 --> 3433.18]  that others maybe would have just discard and throw away
[3433.18 --> 3436.18]  and he puts it together and he doesn't hide the cracks
[3436.18 --> 3441.18]  as imperfections, but he makes them the very beauty of his art.
[3441.18 --> 3443.18]  Thanks be to God.
[3443.18 --> 3445.18]  Let's pray.
[3445.18 --> 3454.18]  Father, we thank you that even in this genealogy
[3454.18 --> 3457.18]  and even through these stories of the Old Testament
[3457.18 --> 3460.18]  that are almost embarrassing to read,
[3460.18 --> 3462.18]  that these are your people.
[3462.18 --> 3468.18]  Lord, even in and through your broken people,
[3468.18 --> 3472.18]  Lord, you shine forth your grace and your glory.
[3472.18 --> 3476.18]  Lord, you take the broken pieces
[3476.18 --> 3479.18]  and you make something beautiful out of it.
[3479.18 --> 3481.18]  Lord, you are God who heals
[3481.18 --> 3484.18]  and you restore and you redeem.
[3484.18 --> 3487.18]  And we thank you, Lord, that Jesus came
[3487.18 --> 3491.18]  through a line of sinners to be the sinless one
[3491.18 --> 3495.18]  who would die for all of these mothers and fathers
[3495.18 --> 3497.18]  listed in this genealogy
[3497.18 --> 3500.18]  and for us, Lord, who need a savior.
[3500.18 --> 3504.18]  Lord, we thank you for this message of Christmas
[3504.18 --> 3506.18]  of why Jesus came.
[3506.18 --> 3509.18]  And Lord, would you help us to turn to him in faith,
[3509.18 --> 3514.18]  to see our own lives in all of its brokenness
[3514.18 --> 3517.18]  and all the cracks, Lord, mended and made well
[3517.18 --> 3520.18]  and made part of the story of what you are doing in the world.
[3520.18 --> 3524.18]  We pray through Jesus and in his name. Amen.
[3524.18 --> 3530.18]  Let's stand and let's sing our song.
[3530.18 --> 3534.18]  For you, Lord, our souls and stillness
[3534.18 --> 3536.18]  will, you Lord, our souls and stillness
[3536.18 --> 3538.18]  will.
[3538.18 --> 3560.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3560.50 --> 3569.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3569.50 --> 3574.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3574.50 --> 3579.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3579.50 --> 3584.50]  O Lord of life, our only hope.
[3584.50 --> 3588.50]  Your radiance shines along, O Lord.
[3588.50 --> 3592.50]  Till you in the dark, Emmanuel come.
[3592.50 --> 3597.50]  Come light our hearts.
[3597.50 --> 3605.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3605.50 --> 3613.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3613.50 --> 3617.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3617.50 --> 3622.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3622.50 --> 3627.50]  Joy our hope, how that there lives.
[3627.50 --> 3631.50]  In you we find more than enough.
[3631.50 --> 3633.50]  We come as you are.
[3633.50 --> 3640.50]  Go heal and restore and light our hearts.
[3640.50 --> 3649.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3649.50 --> 3657.50]  For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness way.
[3657.50 --> 3660.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3660.50 --> 3664.50]  Truly our hope is in you.
[3664.50 --> 3686.50]  We continue to worship the Lord today through the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3686.50 --> 3695.20]  And remember that Jesus came and in giving us Jesus, God didn't withhold his own son, it says, right?
[3696.40 --> 3701.34]  And so in response to God's gracious and lavish love for us,
[3701.34 --> 3707.20]  we give a bit of what God has given us as a sign of worship, a sign of trust in him.
[3708.56 --> 3713.12]  And so as we collect our offering, also our designated offering is for the house of Omid.
[3713.12 --> 3716.92]  I think this might be a new one that's been added to our deacons roster.
[3717.36 --> 3724.52]  This is a local ministry to Iranians, refugees, they help Iranian refugees come and settle.
[3725.04 --> 3731.14]  They also do, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but they also work over there doing ministry.
[3731.52 --> 3734.76]  So, sorry, just edit, I don't know.
[3735.62 --> 3738.96]  Anyway, I invite the deacons to come forward and collect our morning offering.
[3743.12 --> 3744.12]  Amen.
[3764.74 --> 3765.60]  Amen.
[3765.60 --> 3767.60]  Amen.
[3795.60 --> 3797.60]  Amen.
[3825.60 --> 3827.60]  Amen.
[3827.60 --> 3829.60]  Amen.
[3829.60 --> 3831.60]  Amen.
[3837.60 --> 3847.60]  Now also in this time of Advent leading up to Christmas, another way that we can bless others is through this world renewed gift tag.
[3847.60 --> 3855.60]  So you'll see a tree out there and there are some tags there hanging and you can take one and give to a cause to help a needy family in the world.
[3855.60 --> 3863.60]  I think if you have any questions, direct to you to Marion, who is our World Renew liaison or something like that.
[3863.60 --> 3864.60]  Yeah. Okay.
[3864.60 --> 3870.60]  So that's another way that we can we can give and worship God through our giving this Christmas season.
[3870.60 --> 3877.60]  Would you join me in a prayer for the world and for our own community?
[3877.60 --> 3883.60]  And a couple times I'll pause and I will say the words Lord in your mercy.
[3883.60 --> 3886.60]  I invite you to respond by saying hear our prayer.
[3886.60 --> 3892.60]  And also we will conclude our prayer with reciting the Lord's Prayer together.
[3892.60 --> 3894.60]  So please join me in prayer.
[3894.60 --> 3899.60]  God, you are the God who sees.
[3899.60 --> 3909.60]  We thank you that you see people like Bathsheba, people like David, and people like us.
[3909.60 --> 3914.60]  Jesus you are the gentle Shepherd of peace.
[3914.60 --> 3921.60]  You are the true King who protects and guards and defends his people.
[3921.60 --> 3928.54]  We pray that you would join to Jesus' own suffering in his earthly life and on the cross,
[3928.62 --> 3933.08]  the pain of all those who have been hurt in body, mind, and spirit,
[3933.78 --> 3936.66]  by those who betrayed the trust that was placed in them.
[3938.16 --> 3942.32]  Hear the cries, Lord, of our sisters and brothers who have been harmed.
[3943.86 --> 3945.72]  Soothe their broken hearts with hope.
[3947.10 --> 3949.48]  Steady their shaken spirits with faith.
[3949.48 --> 3952.96]  Grant them justice for their cause.
[3953.92 --> 3958.54]  And Holy Spirit, comforter of hearts, heal your people's wounds.
[3959.82 --> 3962.76]  And Lord, make brokenness into wholeness.
[3964.10 --> 3967.04]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3968.88 --> 3975.28]  O God who sees, would you break into our lives and the places where we struggle with sickness and distress.
[3975.28 --> 3980.68]  O God, would you tend the sick, give rest to the weary.
[3981.72 --> 3988.56]  Would you bless those in their maybe final span of time of their lives.
[3989.50 --> 3994.68]  Would you soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, and shield the joyless.
[3994.68 --> 4002.38]  Father, we especially lift up Pat Bauman, who will have an operation on Monday to remove cancer.
[4003.34 --> 4005.00]  Lord, would you be with her.
[4005.74 --> 4007.82]  Would you help the doctors their hands.
[4008.86 --> 4012.16]  Lord, would it be a successful surgery, Lord, and would you have mercy on Pat.
[4012.16 --> 4015.92]  Father, we lift up Pastor Nancy to you.
[4016.64 --> 4022.10]  As she is even now at home across the street recovering from her surgery.
[4023.12 --> 4027.04]  Lord, I thank you that she is getting better every day.
[4027.18 --> 4032.50]  She is able to kind of be up and about and move around and even do a little cooking.
[4032.74 --> 4035.94]  Because she prefers her own cooking.
[4036.88 --> 4041.34]  Lord, we thank you for the many brothers and sisters who bring them food.
[4041.34 --> 4043.90]  And Lord, for all of us who pray for her.
[4044.12 --> 4046.18]  Lord, would you continue to heal her fully.
[4046.88 --> 4047.82]  Give her full recovery.
[4047.94 --> 4051.90]  And Lord, in this time of rest, would you help her to rest in her spirit.
[4052.92 --> 4056.88]  And in her body, would you heal her body and soul during this time.
[4057.56 --> 4060.02]  Lord, we pray also for grace.
[4060.26 --> 4062.06]  Lord, you know her, her needs.
[4062.62 --> 4064.02]  We know that you see her.
[4064.86 --> 4068.04]  And that you are able, Lord, to intervene in her situation.
[4068.04 --> 4072.48]  Lord, we pray for Jordan and his struggle with cancer.
[4073.12 --> 4077.06]  Lord, would you wrap your arms around him and their whole family.
[4077.72 --> 4079.48]  And Lord, would you heal him.
[4079.90 --> 4083.44]  And Lord, through this, Lord, would you also work in his life.
[4083.44 --> 4092.36]  So, Lord, come from heaven with your power and glory.
[4093.48 --> 4099.94]  Lift us up to meet you that we may live and reign with you in your new creation.
[4100.78 --> 4103.50]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4103.50 --> 4106.10]  Oh, God, you are the God who sees.
[4107.22 --> 4110.64]  You see our world heaving under so much trouble and disaster.
[4111.82 --> 4117.56]  This Advent season sees once again a world of war and rumors of war.
[4118.78 --> 4120.56]  And yet the Lord Jesus has come.
[4121.14 --> 4122.68]  And he promises to come again.
[4123.70 --> 4130.74]  God, you are coming in power to bring all nations and all peoples under the rule of your lordship through Jesus Christ.
[4130.74 --> 4136.88]  And so we cry out with all of God's people throughout the centuries and say,
[4137.18 --> 4137.82]  Come, Lord Jesus.
[4138.94 --> 4140.30]  Come and do not delay.
[4141.02 --> 4143.36]  And give courage to your people as we wait.
[4144.22 --> 4146.74]  And hasten the day of your coming.
[4147.68 --> 4151.26]  By your coming, would you raise us to share in the joy of your kingdom.
[4151.82 --> 4154.24]  That we might see it come on earth as it is in heaven.
[4154.82 --> 4159.78]  Where you live and reign with the Father and Spirit, one God, forever and ever.
[4160.74 --> 4163.44]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4164.04 --> 4168.58]  And we lift up all of these prayers, oh God, in the name of Jesus, our high priest and king,
[4168.98 --> 4172.20]  who taught us to pray, saying with him together.
[4173.06 --> 4177.02]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4177.56 --> 4181.80]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4181.80 --> 4184.60]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[4185.10 --> 4190.04]  And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4190.50 --> 4194.34]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4194.98 --> 4200.42]  For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever.
[4201.14 --> 4201.66]  Amen.
[4201.66 --> 4209.54]  Would you please rise, and we will go out with the Lord's benediction, his good word upon us.
[4209.80 --> 4213.52]  For those of you who are in the choir, I'm assuming that's still on.
[4213.66 --> 4214.52]  I don't know about the snow.
[4214.92 --> 4217.76]  But we want to do that pretty much right away.
[4217.86 --> 4221.58]  We have a lot of rehearsing to do for next week.
[4221.58 --> 4226.16]  And so please kind of stay behind, and we will rehearse together.
[4227.42 --> 4231.74]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing upon you.
[4232.28 --> 4237.20]  Now to him who loves us, and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
[4237.74 --> 4242.12]  and has made us to be a kingdom and priest to serve him, God and Father.
[4242.62 --> 4245.34]  To him be glory and power forever and ever.
[4245.98 --> 4246.32]  Amen.
[4251.58 --> 4266.20]  To God be the glory
[4266.20 --> 4271.96]  To God be the glory
[4271.96 --> 4276.58]  To God be the glory
[4276.58 --> 4282.74]  For the sins he has done
[4282.74 --> 4288.74]  With his blood he has sent me
[4288.74 --> 4294.76]  With his power he has raised me
[4294.76 --> 4299.38]  To glory, the glory
[4299.38 --> 4306.38]  For the sins he has done
[4306.38 --> 4310.04]  For the sins he has done
[4310.16 --> 4310.64]  Shкого
[4311.24 --> 4311.52]  To him
[4311.62 --> 4313.08]  To here
[4313.56 --> 4315.38]  To him
[4315.70 --> 4316.26]  To him
[4323.76 --> 4324.36]  when he was
[4325.40 --> 4326.18]  To come
[4327.18 --> 4328.30]  To la
[4333.00 --> 4333.14]  Miss
[4333.14 --> 4363.12]  Thank you.
