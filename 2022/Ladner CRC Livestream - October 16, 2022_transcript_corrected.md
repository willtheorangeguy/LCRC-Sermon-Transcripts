[210.00 → 211.00] Good morning, everyone.
[211.00 → 212.00] Good morning.
[212.00 → 215.00] I want to welcome you to Lander Christian Reformed Church.
[215.00 → 219.00] And especially if this is your first time here or if you just recently started coming,
[219.00 → 223.00] I especially want to extend a very warm welcome to you.
[223.00 → 227.00] We are delighted that you are here with us.
[227.00 → 235.00] So today is a special day because it is Ali Hack lander's 97th birthday.
[240.00 → 246.00] And so we want to celebrate with her.
[246.00 → 250.00] And so right after the worship service today as we go into the Fellowship Hall for Coffee,
[250.00 → 251.00] there will also be some cake.
[251.00 → 258.00] And everyone is invited, and we will celebrate God's blessing and Ali's life over 97 years.
[258.00 → 261.00] So today we are going to do something a little bit different,
[261.00 → 265.00] which is we are going to start after our welcome here with a song.
[265.00 → 268.00] We are going to sing, and then we will go to the call to worship.
[268.00 → 272.00] So let's prepare our hearts, and you can remain seated for now.
[272.00 → 276.00] And let's sing our first song, All Creatures of Our God and King.
[298.00 → 318.00] All Creatures of Our God and King, Lift your voice with us and sing, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[318.00 → 346.00] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[346.00 → 353.00] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[353.00 → 354.00] Alleluia so this all show.
[354.00 → 355.00] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[355.00 → 358.00] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Allen genre.
[358.00 → 366.00] is
[372.56 → 382.00] now
[388.00 → 396.00] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[400.00 → 406.40] All you who are of tender heart,
[407.00 → 412.40] forgiving others take your part.
[412.40 → 419.40] Alleluia, Alleluia.
[419.40 → 425.40] All you who came and sorrowed there,
[425.40 → 430.40] praise God and on Him cast your care.
[431.40 → 436.40] Oh, praise Him, Oh, praise Him.
[436.40 → 448.40] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[448.40 → 456.40] Let all things their Creator bless,
[457.40 → 462.40] and worship Him in humble best.
[463.40 → 468.40] Alleluia, Alleluia.
[468.40 → 475.40] Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
[476.40 → 481.40] and praise the Spirit through the heart.
[482.40 → 487.40] Oh, praise Him, Oh, praise Him.
[487.40 → 499.40] Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
[499.40 → 513.40] When we come together on a Sunday morning,
[514.40 → 516.40] we begin with a call to worship.
[516.40 → 518.40] And what that means is that, amazingly,
[518.40 → 522.40] God Himself invites us to come
[522.40 → 526.40] and to understand Him and to know Him.
[526.40 → 529.40] God wants to be known,
[529.40 → 531.40] and He reveals Himself to us.
[531.40 → 534.40] Yes, He reveals Himself in all creation,
[535.40 → 537.40] but ultimately and supremely,
[537.40 → 540.40] He reveals Himself to us in and through Jesus Christ,
[541.40 → 543.40] as He is revealed in His Word.
[544.40 → 546.40] And that's what worship is all about,
[547.40 → 551.40] is to say that we are here to meet with God.
[551.40 → 554.40] And so I want to invite you to stand,
[554.40 → 560.40] and let's both hear and respond to the call to worship this morning.
[560.40 → 565.40] Our call to worship is from Psalm 124 and Psalm 9.
[565.40 → 568.40] Our help is in the name of the Lord,
[568.40 → 571.40] the Maker of heaven and earth.
[572.40 → 577.40] I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my heart.
[577.40 → 580.40] I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
[581.40 → 584.40] I will be glad and rejoice in you.
[585.40 → 589.40] I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.
[589.40 → 592.40] The mercy of the Lord is everlasting.
[592.40 → 595.40] O come and ask the Lord.
[596.40 → 597.40] Would you please pray with me?
[599.40 → 600.40] Our gracious Father,
[601.40 → 602.40] our help,
[603.40 → 604.40] the one in whom we trust,
[605.40 → 607.40] the one who is ever available to us,
[608.40 → 611.40] thank you that you have taken the initiative in our lives,
[612.40 → 615.40] and you have taken the initiative in this world by revealing yourself.
[615.40 → 618.40] You are the perfection of beauty.
[619.40 → 621.40] You are the fount of all blessings.
[622.40 → 623.40] You are the source of life itself.
[624.40 → 630.40] And yet you are not so far off from us that we can't say that you are my God.
[631.40 → 635.40] So, Father, we come together as your people to worship you today.
[636.40 → 641.40] May we come with a sense of seeking the greatest treasure that we could ever find,
[642.40 → 644.40] which is being in a relationship with you.
[644.40 → 652.40] And we pray, Holy Spirit, that you would turn our eyes, our hearts, and our minds to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[653.40 → 656.40] And we pray that we would leave this time of worship later,
[657.40 → 661.40] not simply having been inspired or even having been informed,
[662.40 → 663.40] but having been transformed,
[664.40 → 668.40] made more and more in the image of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[668.40 → 669.40] in whose name we pray.
[670.40 → 671.40] Amen.
[672.40 → 676.40] So, God's greeting to us comes this morning from Psalm 37 7.
[677.40 → 678.40] And it simply says this,
[679.40 → 681.40] Be still before the Lord,
[682.40 → 683.40] and wait patiently for Him.
[684.40 → 686.40] Be still before the Lord,
[687.40 → 688.40] and wait patiently for Him.
[688.40 → 693.40] As you are able, then, let's turn and greet those around us,
[693.40 → 695.40] especially someone maybe you haven't met.

[866.98 → 878.74] All our longings find attainment when to self we gladly die.
[878.74 → 884.04] Our next song is Christ Be Our Light.
[884.28 → 886.16] Let's be seated for that song.
[908.74 → 910.74] Amen.
[910.74 → 912.74] Amen.
[912.74 → 914.74] Amen.
[918.28 → 918.74] Amen.
[919.28 → 924.82] Longing for light, we wait in darkness.
[925.92 → 931.12] Longing for truth, we turn to you.
[931.12 → 937.28] Make us your own, your holy people.
[938.14 → 943.18] Light for the world to see.
[944.04 → 947.94] Rise be our light.
[948.42 → 950.86] Shine in our hearts.
[951.24 → 954.04] Shine through the darkness.
[954.04 → 959.30] Rise be our light.
[959.72 → 962.06] Shine in your church.
[962.52 → 964.04] Gather today.
[967.04 → 972.24] Longing for peace, our world is troubled.
[973.28 → 977.70] Longing for hope, let it despair.
[977.70 → 984.64] Your word alone has come to save us.
[984.64 → 990.14] Make us your living voice.
[990.70 → 994.80] Rise be our light.
[995.26 → 997.76] Shine in our hearts.
[998.08 → 1000.86] Shine through the darkness.
[1002.22 → 1006.04] Rise be our light.
[1006.04 → 1008.80] Shine in your church.
[1008.80 → 1008.86] Shine in your church.
[1008.86 → 1010.86] Gather today.
[1014.38 → 1017.44] Many the gifts.
[1017.82 → 1019.86] Many the people.
[1020.94 → 1023.38] Many the hearts.
[1023.76 → 1025.44] That you to belong.
[1026.88 → 1031.56] Let us be servants to one another.
[1031.56 → 1036.56] Making your kingdom come.
[1036.56 → 1037.56] Making your kingdom come.
[1037.56 → 1042.72] Christ be our light.
[1042.72 → 1045.62] Shine in your hearts.
[1045.62 → 1048.84] Shine through the darkness.
[1049.84 → 1054.06] Rise be our light.
[1054.06 → 1056.80] Shine in your church.
[1057.34 → 1059.04] Gather today.
[1059.04 → 1061.54] May our hearts.
[1061.54 → 1061.92] Amen.
[1067.86 → 1070.22] Amen.
[1070.22 → 1070.30] Amen.
[1071.90 → 1077.60] So we come now to a time when after acknowledging God's call to us to worship him,
[1078.06 → 1085.48] and after having sung his praises and kind of tuned our hearts and lifting our hearts to worship him,
[1085.48 → 1098.34] We now seek his face and ask him to search our hearts and to grant us forgiveness for all the ways that we have sinned against him and against one another.
[1099.18 → 1104.34] Our call to confession is from Psalm 34, verses 17 and 18.
[1105.52 → 1106.66] So this is what it says.
[1107.56 → 1112.78] The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.
[1112.78 → 1115.64] He rescues them from all their troubles.
[1116.50 → 1118.68] The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[1119.66 → 1123.30] He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.
[1124.94 → 1126.34] So let's pray together.
[1127.32 → 1135.64] Most merciful God, we confess that we get overwhelmed with life and fail to trust you.
[1136.58 → 1137.42] Forgive us.
[1137.42 → 1146.04] Capture our minds with your love, your provision and abundance you give in your son, Jesus.
[1146.94 → 1151.60] Renew us through your spirit to rest in you alone.
[1152.78 → 1157.72] So let's acknowledge these things silently before the Lord.
[1158.80 → 1164.20] In the quietness of our own hearts, knowing forgiveness and rest are freely available in Jesus.
[1164.20 → 1194.18] Our Lord Jesus, you call all of us who are weary.
[1194.18 → 1198.64] And heavy laden to come and to take your yoke.
[1200.14 → 1202.54] Because you are gentle and lowly in heart.
[1204.34 → 1209.30] So Father, when our hearts are anxious, we often fail to trust in you.
[1210.02 → 1216.68] And we often, Lord, speak or cause harm to those around us.
[1217.66 → 1218.92] And so, Lord, would you renew us?
[1219.00 → 1228.26] Would you enable us to truly rest in what Jesus has accomplished for us and who he is for us as our Lord and Saviour?
[1229.30 → 1232.36] And Lord, who you have made us to be, your beloved children.
[1232.36 → 1238.72] Lord, help us to turn to you, Lord, by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[1238.92 → 1242.88] Work in us and make us more after the image of our Lord Jesus.
[1243.64 → 1248.90] We thank you for his great love, your great love, and your grace to us, even in our sin.
[1249.60 → 1250.86] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[1251.18 → 1251.44] Amen.
[1251.44 → 1251.52] Amen.
[1254.48 → 1256.08] So I want to invite you to stand.
[1256.08 → 1262.78] Only by the blood of Christ have we been declared righteous in God's eyes.
[1263.32 → 1266.90] He has raised to new life those whose trust is in him.
[1267.58 → 1269.78] And so we remember the hope of his grace.
[1270.34 → 1272.92] From Titus, chapter 3, verses 4 and 5.
[1273.92 → 1274.60] It says this,
[1274.60 → 1299.76] Let's sing now our song of response.
[1299.92 → 1301.78] Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
[1304.60 → 1334.58] Father in heaven, how we love you.
[1334.60 → 1349.96] of you we lift your name in all the earth may your kingdom be established in our praises
[1351.96 → 1353.08] as your people
[1364.60 → 1372.36] who was and is and is to come
[1372.36 → 1375.80] blessed be the lord
[1375.80 → 1380.84] god almighty
[1380.84 → 1394.84] who reigns forever
[1402.52 → 1408.84] for the sacrifice of love has won my pardon
[1408.84 → 1414.84] and his resurrection power gives me life
[1415.72 → 1418.84] blessed be the lord
[1418.84 → 1422.84] god almighty
[1424.20 → 1428.84] who was and is and is to come
[1428.84 → 1432.84] blessed be the lord
[1432.84 → 1436.84] god almighty
[1438.84 → 1444.84] who reigns forever
[1444.84 → 1460.04] so it is time that we dismiss the children to go to their Sunday school classes
[1460.04 → 1464.68] in our bulletin it says ages three to kindergarten, but that's just a typo it's actually
[1464.68 → 1469.88] grades five and under anyone whose grades five and under may go to their Sunday school classes
[1469.88 → 1483.88] and for us let's prepare our hearts now to hear the reading of god's word
[1483.88 → 1489.88] we will be reading from Ephesians 5 verses 21 through 33
[1489.88 → 1503.72] we will be reading from Ephesians 5 verses 21 through 33
[1503.72 → 1505.72] 23
[1533.72 → 1539.60] Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
[1540.02 → 1546.20] to make her holy, cleansing her by washing the water through the word,
[1547.02 → 1550.28] and to present her to himself as the radiant church,
[1550.76 → 1555.58] without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
[1555.58 → 1563.92] In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
[1564.78 → 1568.44] He who loves his wife loves himself.
[1569.24 → 1572.24] After all, no one ever hated their own body,
[1572.64 → 1576.80] but they feed and care for their body just as Christ does the church.
[1577.86 → 1581.64] For we are all members of his body.
[1581.84 → 1584.96] For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother,
[1584.96 → 1589.32] and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.
[1590.24 → 1594.60] This is a profound mystery, but I am talking about Christ and the church.
[1595.38 → 1601.56] However, each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself,
[1601.92 → 1604.18] and the wife must respect her husband.
[1605.00 → 1606.42] This is the word of the Lord.
[1606.42 → 1607.60] Amen.
[1614.96 → 1618.08] Thank you, Kevin and Nadia.
[1620.38 → 1621.46] So good morning.
[1623.84 → 1630.10] The Bible teaches that in Jesus Christ, God is making all things new.
[1630.10 → 1636.66] And all who are separated from God because of sin can, in Jesus Christ,
[1637.14 → 1641.28] through faith in him, be brought back into relationship with God.
[1641.66 → 1642.96] And that is our hope.
[1643.80 → 1647.36] That through Christ and through faith in him, we are reconciled to God.
[1647.56 → 1649.96] We are brought back into relationship with God.
[1649.96 → 1654.32] And so we come now to this letter of Ephesians.
[1654.32 → 1657.48] It's written to the church in the ancient Roman city of Ephesus,
[1657.88 → 1662.90] in which Jews and Gentiles, who had become Christians,
[1663.18 → 1664.82] both of them reconciled to God,
[1665.46 → 1669.02] were now struggling to live together.
[1669.56 → 1673.04] They were struggling to live together in peace and in unity as a church.
[1674.00 → 1677.30] And so Paul is trying to teach them how to do that.
[1677.30 → 1681.82] And today we come to the highlight of the letter
[1681.82 → 1688.74] because this is the clearest vision of how a people who are redeemed
[1688.74 → 1693.44] and transformed by the gospel can live together in Christ.
[1694.70 → 1699.02] So as we look at this passage together,
[1699.18 → 1702.74] let's come before the Lord asking for his help in prayer.
[1702.90 → 1703.26] Let's pray.
[1703.26 → 1710.02] Heavenly Father, we pray right now that the words of my mouth
[1710.02 → 1713.06] in the meditation of all of our hearts
[1713.06 → 1716.08] would be pleasing and acceptable in your sight.
[1717.66 → 1721.20] Father, as we open up your word, would you show us Jesus?
[1722.58 → 1724.06] And Lord, would you be glorified?
[1724.88 → 1727.00] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1727.00 → 1731.58] So I want to begin by asking you to submit to a test.
[1732.60 → 1734.64] It's actually more like a quiz.
[1735.48 → 1737.30] It actually, technically, is called a pop quiz.
[1738.62 → 1743.44] It only has one question, and it will not be marked.
[1744.04 → 1746.26] It's very low stakes.
[1746.94 → 1748.38] I don't even know what your answers will be.
[1748.56 → 1749.40] But here's the quiz.
[1749.40 → 1753.88] When you found out that our sermon today was on marriage,
[1754.64 → 1756.06] you said to yourself,
[1757.56 → 1760.08] A, I'm glad I'm not the preacher.
[1762.64 → 1766.00] B, is it too late to sign up for nursery duty?
[1768.24 → 1773.16] C, why did I choose this Sunday to bring a friend to church?
[1773.16 → 1779.04] D, I'd better make a dinner reservation for later tonight.
[1780.78 → 1783.00] E, all of the above.
[1784.98 → 1788.42] Or you can do what my wife did, which is not come.
[1790.62 → 1793.38] She isn't here, but actually, the real reason is
[1793.38 → 1796.26] my daughter Ellie is playing guitar at another church,
[1796.32 → 1799.58] and so my wife went to watch her and support her.
[1799.58 → 1803.58] But marriage is a difficult topic.
[1805.04 → 1808.78] It's such a difficult topic because there is so much about marriage
[1808.78 → 1810.38] that is a mystery.
[1811.62 → 1813.86] This week, I ran across some advice
[1813.86 → 1817.26] that captures the reality of this mystery of marriage.
[1818.16 → 1822.32] It says, there are only two ways to handle your spouse,
[1822.78 → 1825.56] and no one knows either of them.
[1827.76 → 1828.92] It's really true.
[1829.58 → 1831.22] Even Paul, in this passage,
[1831.78 → 1835.80] describes marriage as a profound mystery.
[1836.88 → 1838.78] But actually, what he means by that
[1838.78 → 1840.66] is that marriage reveals something.
[1841.38 → 1843.26] In the Bible, that's what a mystery is.
[1843.36 → 1846.52] It reveals something previously hidden.
[1848.42 → 1851.38] Marriage reveals something profound.
[1852.38 → 1854.38] Throughout Scripture, we are given marriage
[1854.38 → 1859.94] marriage as this grand metaphor for God's relationship to his people.
[1861.08 → 1864.02] Marriage for us is a revelation of the gospel.
[1865.46 → 1868.26] But the other thing that we learn in this passage
[1868.26 → 1874.62] is that the gospel redeems our very experience of marriage as well.
[1875.44 → 1875.52] Right?
[1875.52 → 1876.88] God reveals the gospel,
[1877.16 → 1878.38] that through Jesus Christ,
[1878.44 → 1880.86] we can be reconciled to God and reconciled to one another.
[1880.96 → 1881.60] That's the gospel.
[1882.08 → 1884.08] And when we live into that,
[1884.14 → 1888.52] that transforms our very approach to marriage.
[1888.52 → 1892.32] And so those are the two key ideas
[1892.32 → 1894.66] I want us to consider together this morning,
[1894.74 → 1897.74] that the gospel redeems our experience of marriage,
[1897.74 → 1903.10] and in turn, marriage actually reveals the mystery of the gospel.
[1903.10 → 1909.36] Now, I will say now that this is kind of a complicated passage.
[1909.64 → 1911.44] I don't understand everything in here,
[1911.48 → 1913.50] and I'm not going to be able to cover everything in here.
[1914.18 → 1917.40] But I think those are the two main things I mentioned
[1917.40 → 1919.60] that Paul wants us to see.
[1919.78 → 1922.56] And I think we can, all of us,
[1922.62 → 1924.28] whether we're married, whether we're single,
[1925.12 → 1927.86] all of us can learn about what relationships
[1927.86 → 1930.52] in the body of Christ really should look like.
[1930.58 → 1931.64] So this is for all of us.
[1931.64 → 1933.94] Remember, as Paul is reading this letter,
[1934.02 → 1936.90] he's reading it to a group of people sitting in a church
[1936.90 → 1939.12] with husbands and wives, with children,
[1939.68 → 1942.26] with singles and masters and slaves and everyone.
[1942.50 → 1945.92] And we're all learning together what this looks like.
[1946.56 → 1949.74] So first, the gospel redeems marriage.
[1951.78 → 1954.82] And let's look here about what Paul says
[1954.82 → 1956.64] about how the gospel redeems marriage.
[1956.82 → 1957.68] And to understand this,
[1957.74 → 1960.38] we need to know something of the cultural context
[1960.38 → 1962.58] in which Paul is writing.
[1963.68 → 1965.86] Both in the Greco-Roman world
[1965.86 → 1968.06] and in the Jewish world,
[1968.72 → 1972.92] women were severely disadvantaged socially,
[1973.48 → 1975.76] even to the point of oppression.
[1976.64 → 1978.64] Massive injustices were done
[1978.64 → 1981.54] by husbands against wives.
[1981.54 → 1984.28] There was a Jewish morning prayer,
[1984.28 → 1985.26] maybe you've heard of it,
[1985.76 → 1987.70] where Jewish men would say,
[1988.22 → 1990.08] blessed are you, Lord our God,
[1990.20 → 1991.30] ruler of the universe,
[1991.80 → 1993.82] who has not made me a woman.
[1996.30 → 1997.88] And they would pray that
[1997.88 → 2000.98] because of the great disadvantages
[2000.98 → 2002.82] of being a woman.
[2003.98 → 2006.26] The Greco-Roman world was even worse.
[2006.26 → 2008.94] Baby girls were often put out
[2008.94 → 2011.62] to be exposed to the elements and die
[2011.62 → 2014.04] because in that time and place,
[2014.18 → 2015.66] girls would not be able
[2015.66 → 2018.34] to bring financial resources and family honour.
[2019.38 → 2021.96] There was no social security back then.
[2022.28 → 2024.72] Parents had to rely on their sons to care for them.
[2024.72 → 2028.78] So this was the world for women.
[2028.96 → 2031.44] It was a lamentable history.
[2032.44 → 2034.34] But now the Me Too movement
[2034.34 → 2036.64] that has exposed sexual abuse
[2036.64 → 2039.14] and sports and Hollywood and politics
[2039.14 → 2040.48] and in the church
[2040.48 → 2044.50] demonstrates that this is still an issue today.
[2046.00 → 2047.78] And so we have this passage
[2047.78 → 2051.74] where there's a collision of gospel impulses.
[2052.54 → 2053.36] On the one hand,
[2053.36 → 2054.54] we have the gospel impulse
[2054.54 → 2056.28] to stand against injustice,
[2057.04 → 2058.16] right, to protect women.
[2058.86 → 2059.56] And that is good.
[2059.62 → 2060.20] That is right.
[2060.74 → 2062.56] And we also have the gospel impulse
[2062.56 → 2064.68] to obey scripture.
[2065.48 → 2067.70] And that too is right.
[2068.38 → 2069.46] And here it feels like
[2069.46 → 2070.64] these two things are colliding
[2070.64 → 2071.42] because Paul,
[2072.04 → 2073.62] doesn't he say in verse 22,
[2073.98 → 2075.26] wives, submit yourselves
[2075.26 → 2076.14] to your own husbands?
[2077.04 → 2078.22] And so what do we do with that?
[2079.44 → 2081.24] Because some throughout the history
[2081.24 → 2082.38] of the church
[2082.38 → 2084.48] have argued that Paul,
[2084.98 → 2085.38] in fact,
[2085.46 → 2086.40] does advocate
[2086.40 → 2088.58] the subjugation of wives here.
[2089.88 → 2091.34] Because in this passage,
[2091.50 → 2092.70] Paul clearly mirrors
[2092.70 → 2093.94] what are called
[2093.94 → 2096.02] the Stoic household codes.
[2096.84 → 2098.10] These were early Greek
[2098.10 → 2099.86] and later Roman teachings
[2099.86 → 2101.66] that were to instruct men
[2101.66 → 2103.38] how to use their authority
[2103.38 → 2104.14] in the house
[2104.14 → 2106.08] to rule over their wives
[2106.08 → 2108.06] and how to rule over their children
[2108.06 → 2108.96] and their slaves.
[2110.10 → 2111.52] And Paul does use
[2111.52 → 2113.26] those household codes
[2113.26 → 2114.70] as a model
[2114.70 → 2116.78] for what he's talking about here.
[2117.00 → 2119.54] It's very much a literary pattern
[2119.54 → 2120.48] that he is following
[2120.48 → 2122.46] that everyone in that time
[2122.46 → 2123.48] would have recognized.
[2124.12 → 2125.36] He uses this as a pattern.
[2126.64 → 2128.30] But it's also true
[2128.30 → 2131.90] that Paul completely subverts
[2131.90 → 2134.06] these household codes.
[2134.06 → 2135.68] And the way he does that,
[2135.76 → 2136.10] first,
[2136.50 → 2137.88] is by expanding them.
[2138.52 → 2139.98] Because those household codes,
[2140.58 → 2141.10] originally,
[2141.26 → 2142.20] they only spoke
[2142.20 → 2143.20] to the patriarch
[2143.20 → 2144.68] of the household.
[2145.24 → 2146.50] They talked to the husbands
[2146.50 → 2148.48] and they didn't really think
[2148.48 → 2149.04] that the women
[2149.04 → 2150.30] were even worth addressing.
[2151.44 → 2152.10] But then here,
[2152.22 → 2153.26] in verse 22,
[2154.20 → 2155.84] Paul also speaks
[2155.84 → 2157.14] to the wives,
[2157.64 → 2159.36] which was unheard of,
[2159.96 → 2161.34] suggesting that they, too,
[2161.34 → 2162.50] are worthy
[2162.50 → 2164.00] of being addressed.
[2164.84 → 2165.32] They, too,
[2165.38 → 2166.78] were a dignified
[2166.78 → 2167.70] part of the household.
[2167.86 → 2168.54] They were full
[2168.54 → 2170.34] and equal participants
[2170.34 → 2172.40] in the people of God.
[2173.38 → 2174.28] This is revolutionary.
[2174.60 → 2175.82] We take it for granted now,
[2175.88 → 2176.44] but this was
[2176.44 → 2178.18] totally transformative
[2178.18 → 2179.02] in that time.
[2179.98 → 2180.76] In Galatians,
[2180.92 → 2181.88] chapter 3,
[2181.94 → 2182.48] verse 28,
[2182.64 → 2183.30] Paul says,
[2183.66 → 2184.86] there is neither Jew
[2184.86 → 2185.66] nor Gentile,
[2185.84 → 2187.06] neither slave nor free,
[2187.36 → 2188.22] nor is there
[2188.22 → 2189.24] male and female,
[2189.24 → 2190.12] for you are all
[2190.12 → 2191.32] one in Christ.
[2192.20 → 2192.74] He's not saying
[2192.74 → 2193.44] that we don't have
[2193.44 → 2194.02] these roles,
[2194.16 → 2195.66] but that we have
[2195.66 → 2196.64] equal dignity.
[2197.44 → 2198.16] We are fully
[2198.16 → 2199.38] in Christ together
[2199.38 → 2200.58] as the body of Christ
[2200.58 → 2201.12] in the world.
[2202.70 → 2204.10] Now, Paul doesn't only
[2204.10 → 2205.28] expand these
[2205.28 → 2206.24] ancient Stoic
[2206.24 → 2207.12] household tables,
[2207.28 → 2208.10] but he also
[2208.10 → 2210.54] completely redirects them.
[2211.34 → 2212.32] Because in those
[2212.32 → 2213.16] household codes,
[2213.36 → 2214.86] the primary subject
[2214.86 → 2215.90] addressing men
[2215.90 → 2216.78] was authority.
[2216.96 → 2217.82] You are in charge,
[2217.82 → 2218.74] and here is how
[2218.74 → 2219.70] to use your authority
[2219.70 → 2220.50] in the household
[2220.50 → 2221.66] to manage
[2221.66 → 2223.12] your wife
[2223.12 → 2223.92] and your children
[2223.92 → 2224.78] and your slaves.
[2225.58 → 2226.94] But in this passage,
[2227.28 → 2228.20] when he's talking
[2228.20 → 2228.76] to men,
[2228.94 → 2229.84] what does he talk about?
[2230.94 → 2231.46] Love.
[2232.74 → 2233.26] Service.
[2234.18 → 2235.04] Self-giving.
[2236.46 → 2236.60] Right?
[2236.66 → 2237.16] So clearly,
[2237.28 → 2238.08] Paul is not simply
[2238.08 → 2239.36] towing the cultural line
[2239.36 → 2240.06] and advocating
[2240.06 → 2241.28] the subjugation of wives.
[2241.64 → 2242.10] Rather,
[2242.28 → 2243.00] what he's doing
[2243.00 → 2244.50] is he's applying
[2244.50 → 2245.98] the principle,
[2245.98 → 2247.14] the gospel principle
[2247.14 → 2248.58] of oneness in Christ
[2248.58 → 2250.66] to the everyday
[2250.66 → 2251.74] relationships
[2251.74 → 2252.68] in which
[2252.68 → 2255.30] people find themselves.
[2257.26 → 2258.84] And especially here
[2258.84 → 2259.80] in the context
[2259.80 → 2260.84] of marriage.
[2261.08 → 2261.88] How do we
[2261.88 → 2263.00] take this oneness
[2263.00 → 2263.66] of the gospel
[2263.66 → 2264.34] that we have,
[2264.38 → 2264.92] that we are
[2264.92 → 2266.22] neither male nor female,
[2266.32 → 2267.10] but one in Christ,
[2267.16 → 2268.52] and how do we live this out
[2268.52 → 2269.88] in life,
[2269.94 → 2270.56] in marriage?
[2270.66 → 2271.74] This is everyday stuff.
[2271.82 → 2272.70] How do we even
[2272.70 → 2273.44] do this together?
[2275.22 → 2276.22] And so he's applying
[2276.22 → 2276.86] the gospel
[2276.86 → 2278.30] to marriage
[2278.30 → 2279.14] in this passage.
[2280.78 → 2281.80] So our passage
[2281.80 → 2283.26] begins in verse 21.
[2284.22 → 2284.98] It says,
[2285.74 → 2287.30] submit to one another
[2287.30 → 2288.36] out of reverence
[2288.36 → 2289.02] for Christ.
[2290.78 → 2291.84] Now actually,
[2292.56 → 2293.88] in chapter 5,
[2293.96 → 2294.56] verse 1,
[2294.62 → 2295.44] right at the beginning
[2295.44 → 2296.84] of this entire chapter,
[2297.76 → 2299.26] Paul commands us
[2299.26 → 2300.64] to love.
[2301.42 → 2302.28] So he says
[2302.28 → 2302.98] in chapter 5,
[2303.00 → 2303.52] verse 1,
[2304.30 → 2305.66] follow God's example,
[2305.88 → 2306.14] therefore,
[2306.34 → 2307.48] as dearly loved children
[2307.48 → 2308.50] and walk in the way
[2308.50 → 2309.04] of love,
[2309.60 → 2310.80] just as Christ loved us
[2310.80 → 2311.62] and gave himself up
[2311.62 → 2312.16] for us
[2312.16 → 2313.64] as a fragrant offering
[2313.64 → 2314.88] and sacrifice to God.
[2315.54 → 2317.46] And so all of chapter 5
[2317.46 → 2318.40] has been describing
[2318.40 → 2318.88] what?
[2319.60 → 2320.58] The relationships
[2320.58 → 2321.62] between brothers
[2321.62 → 2322.62] and sisters
[2322.62 → 2323.58] in Christ
[2323.58 → 2324.94] who are now called
[2324.94 → 2326.40] to love one another
[2326.40 → 2327.56] and to submit
[2327.56 → 2328.56] to one another
[2328.56 → 2330.52] as the body
[2330.52 → 2331.30] of Christ together.
[2331.30 → 2332.16] all of us
[2332.16 → 2333.38] are loving one another.
[2333.52 → 2334.10] We're submitting
[2334.10 → 2334.92] to one another.
[2335.84 → 2336.42] And so Paul,
[2336.58 → 2337.30] in the inspiration
[2337.30 → 2337.80] of Scripture,
[2337.98 → 2338.60] is making a very
[2338.60 → 2339.52] important point here
[2339.52 → 2341.70] that more fundamental
[2341.70 → 2342.80] than the husband-wife
[2342.80 → 2343.40] relationship
[2343.40 → 2345.04] is the brother
[2345.04 → 2346.30] and sister relationship
[2346.30 → 2346.86] in Christ.
[2348.62 → 2349.14] Now,
[2349.26 → 2349.84] I don't get
[2349.84 → 2350.92] how this works,
[2351.36 → 2352.78] but Jesus says
[2352.78 → 2353.60] that in heaven,
[2354.22 → 2355.32] there will not be marriage.
[2356.70 → 2356.94] Right?
[2356.94 → 2357.64] In heaven,
[2357.74 → 2358.66] I will not be married
[2358.66 → 2359.30] to my wife,
[2359.40 → 2359.72] Christy.
[2359.82 → 2359.92] Well,
[2359.92 → 2360.66] I hope I get
[2360.66 → 2362.56] to be next,
[2362.76 → 2363.76] in an adjacent room,
[2363.96 → 2364.20] maybe.
[2364.76 → 2365.38] I hope to be able
[2365.38 → 2365.98] to see her
[2365.98 → 2366.90] a lot.
[2367.76 → 2369.06] But I will not be married
[2369.06 → 2370.60] in heaven.
[2371.44 → 2371.92] But,
[2372.96 → 2374.14] Christy and I
[2374.14 → 2375.88] will eternally
[2375.88 → 2377.38] be brother and sister
[2377.38 → 2377.92] in Christ.
[2378.86 → 2380.28] We are only now
[2380.28 → 2381.02] temporarily
[2381.02 → 2382.30] husband and wife.
[2382.30 → 2383.82] So the greater
[2383.82 → 2385.12] context of our
[2385.12 → 2386.36] relationships in marriage
[2386.36 → 2388.06] is as fellow Christians,
[2388.64 → 2389.66] loving one another
[2389.66 → 2390.30] and submitting
[2390.30 → 2391.14] to one another.
[2392.34 → 2392.58] Now,
[2392.64 → 2393.50] that being said,
[2393.62 → 2394.46] what then does
[2394.46 → 2395.66] this look like
[2395.66 → 2396.04] in marriage?
[2396.14 → 2396.60] How does
[2396.60 → 2397.80] the wife submit
[2397.80 → 2398.28] to the husband
[2398.28 → 2398.98] and the husband
[2398.98 → 2399.92] submit to the wife?
[2400.66 → 2401.88] That's verse 21 says.
[2402.50 → 2403.34] So let's look
[2403.34 → 2404.08] at verse 22.
[2405.26 → 2406.44] Verse 22 says,
[2406.88 → 2407.34] wives,
[2407.48 → 2408.18] submit yourselves
[2408.18 → 2409.14] to your own husbands
[2409.14 → 2409.92] as you do
[2409.92 → 2410.62] to the Lord.
[2411.52 → 2412.10] Here's what
[2412.10 → 2412.64] this means.
[2413.34 → 2413.94] The meaning
[2413.94 → 2414.38] of the word
[2414.38 → 2414.74] submit
[2414.74 → 2417.18] is to arrange
[2417.18 → 2417.70] under,
[2417.82 → 2418.54] to order
[2418.54 → 2420.08] yourself
[2420.08 → 2420.82] under
[2420.82 → 2422.14] for the good
[2422.14 → 2423.18] of your husband
[2423.18 → 2424.34] so that you
[2424.34 → 2425.32] can support him
[2425.32 → 2426.28] and help him
[2426.28 → 2427.54] to flourish
[2427.54 → 2429.22] in the Lord,
[2429.32 → 2430.10] in life.
[2431.44 → 2432.22] Then when it says
[2432.22 → 2433.14] in verse 24,
[2433.36 → 2434.34] wives should submit
[2434.34 → 2435.00] to their husbands
[2435.00 → 2435.76] in everything,
[2436.32 → 2436.82] that phrase
[2436.82 → 2437.38] in everything
[2437.38 → 2438.08] doesn't just mean
[2438.08 → 2439.14] that he's in charge
[2439.14 → 2439.58] of what colour
[2439.58 → 2440.42] the car should be
[2440.42 → 2441.86] or what you're
[2441.86 → 2442.22] going to eat
[2442.22 → 2442.66] for dinner.
[2442.90 → 2443.44] It means that
[2443.44 → 2444.14] in every single
[2444.14 → 2445.54] part of his life,
[2445.98 → 2446.86] the wife is to
[2446.86 → 2448.00] arrange herself
[2448.00 → 2449.44] so that he
[2449.44 → 2450.58] can flourish.
[2451.48 → 2452.30] So it's in
[2452.30 → 2453.30] every part
[2453.30 → 2454.04] of your life
[2454.04 → 2455.08] you ask,
[2455.50 → 2456.50] how can I
[2456.50 → 2457.76] give myself
[2457.76 → 2459.20] for his good?
[2461.40 → 2462.68] And so to be clear,
[2462.78 → 2463.30] this is not
[2463.30 → 2464.16] a loss
[2464.16 → 2465.04] of the wife's
[2465.04 → 2465.78] agency,
[2465.78 → 2467.18] but it's actually
[2467.18 → 2468.32] a redirection
[2468.32 → 2469.20] of her agency
[2469.20 → 2470.62] towards the
[2470.62 → 2471.26] flourishing
[2471.26 → 2472.52] of her husband
[2472.52 → 2474.04] so that this
[2474.04 → 2474.98] man can grow
[2474.98 → 2475.72] to become more
[2475.72 → 2476.70] and more like Christ
[2476.70 → 2477.80] and wives,
[2477.86 → 2478.54] you help him
[2478.54 → 2479.10] do that.
[2479.64 → 2480.56] He learns that
[2480.56 → 2481.18] from you.
[2481.60 → 2482.70] You are his helper
[2482.70 → 2483.96] and you submit
[2483.96 → 2484.76] to him
[2484.76 → 2486.40] by pointing him
[2486.40 → 2487.70] toward the Lord Jesus.
[2489.34 → 2490.32] That's what it means
[2490.32 → 2491.06] for a wife to submit
[2491.06 → 2491.68] to her husband.
[2491.84 → 2492.16] It's for her
[2492.16 → 2493.88] to deny herself
[2493.88 → 2495.80] to serve him
[2495.80 → 2497.04] so that he would
[2497.04 → 2498.00] flourish in Christ.
[2499.92 → 2500.90] But we should also
[2500.90 → 2501.52] be clear about
[2501.52 → 2502.30] what this passage
[2502.30 → 2503.22] is not saying
[2503.22 → 2504.08] because it's been
[2504.08 → 2506.42] so frequently abused.
[2507.24 → 2507.80] First,
[2507.90 → 2508.52] it is not
[2508.52 → 2509.66] a general statement
[2509.66 → 2510.88] about male-female
[2510.88 → 2511.52] relationships
[2511.52 → 2512.20] in society.
[2512.44 → 2513.02] It says,
[2513.20 → 2513.60] wives,
[2513.84 → 2514.58] submit to
[2514.58 → 2515.82] your own
[2515.82 → 2516.60] husbands.
[2517.66 → 2518.44] So this passage
[2518.44 → 2519.14] is not asking
[2519.14 → 2520.32] for women in general
[2520.32 → 2521.30] to submit to men
[2521.30 → 2521.84] in general.
[2522.50 → 2523.14] The passage
[2523.14 → 2523.66] is not
[2523.66 → 2524.60] prohibiting women
[2524.60 → 2525.68] from taking positions
[2525.68 → 2526.28] of leadership
[2526.28 → 2527.34] in society
[2527.34 → 2527.96] or even
[2527.96 → 2528.62] in the church.
[2530.34 → 2530.86] Second,
[2531.04 → 2531.56] this passage
[2531.56 → 2532.10] is not about
[2532.10 → 2533.20] gender stereotypes.
[2534.00 → 2534.62] It's not about
[2534.62 → 2535.62] wives doing laundry
[2535.62 → 2536.64] and husbands
[2536.64 → 2537.76] changing the light bulbs.
[2538.60 → 2539.34] It's not just like
[2539.34 → 2540.42] the 1950s
[2540.42 → 2540.84] just kind of
[2540.84 → 2541.40] pop right out
[2541.40 → 2542.04] of this passage.
[2542.74 → 2543.22] In fact,
[2543.26 → 2544.22] there's hardly anything
[2544.22 → 2544.88] in this passage
[2544.88 → 2545.92] that actually seeks
[2545.92 → 2547.30] to culturally define
[2547.30 → 2548.40] what submission
[2548.40 → 2549.00] looks like
[2549.00 → 2550.30] because how we
[2550.30 → 2551.14] live this out
[2551.14 → 2552.12] is different
[2552.12 → 2553.02] in every culture
[2553.02 → 2554.06] and every time
[2554.06 → 2554.90] and every place
[2554.90 → 2556.68] and every marriage
[2556.68 → 2557.98] will look differently.
[2559.94 → 2560.10] You know,
[2560.18 → 2561.32] in Proverbs 31
[2561.32 → 2562.36] is this passage
[2562.36 → 2563.44] that describes
[2563.44 → 2564.60] the noble wife.
[2565.36 → 2565.74] It describes
[2565.74 → 2566.18] a woman
[2566.18 → 2566.98] who is actively
[2566.98 → 2568.34] engaged in business
[2568.34 → 2569.26] and in trade.
[2569.52 → 2570.00] A woman
[2570.00 → 2570.82] whose wisdom
[2570.82 → 2571.50] is sought
[2571.50 → 2572.76] in the public square.
[2573.90 → 2574.34] And so there's
[2574.34 → 2575.64] no gender stereotyping
[2575.64 → 2576.30] going on here.
[2578.26 → 2578.90] Third,
[2579.22 → 2580.28] to clarify,
[2581.14 → 2582.34] Paul is not
[2582.34 → 2583.16] addressing the husband.
[2583.88 → 2584.42] He's talking
[2584.42 → 2585.00] to the wife.
[2586.06 → 2586.84] Paul never says
[2586.84 → 2587.60] to the husband,
[2588.16 → 2589.44] make your wife submit.
[2590.94 → 2591.50] Submission
[2591.50 → 2593.00] is her gift
[2593.00 → 2594.22] to give.
[2594.94 → 2596.12] It's about her
[2596.12 → 2597.24] submitting
[2597.24 → 2598.20] to the Lord Jesus
[2598.20 → 2599.64] by submitting
[2599.64 → 2600.52] to her husband.
[2601.28 → 2602.00] So submission
[2602.00 → 2602.94] is her gift to give.
[2603.00 → 2603.82] It's not the husband's
[2603.82 → 2604.46] to demand.
[2605.18 → 2605.58] Right?
[2605.62 → 2605.98] It's something
[2605.98 → 2606.50] that the wife
[2606.50 → 2607.62] does voluntarily.
[2607.62 → 2609.94] And actually,
[2610.02 → 2610.78] what's fascinating
[2610.78 → 2611.86] is that Paul
[2611.86 → 2613.48] never even uses
[2613.48 → 2614.46] the imperative
[2614.46 → 2616.06] when asking
[2616.06 → 2616.52] the wife
[2616.52 → 2616.94] to submit
[2616.94 → 2617.68] to her husband.
[2617.90 → 2618.60] In other words,
[2618.70 → 2619.92] Paul never actually
[2619.92 → 2620.54] commands
[2620.54 → 2621.62] the wife
[2621.62 → 2622.24] to do anything.
[2622.90 → 2624.54] In the original Greek,
[2624.98 → 2625.70] verse 22
[2625.70 → 2626.56] doesn't even have
[2626.56 → 2626.88] the word
[2626.88 → 2627.76] to submit.
[2628.24 → 2629.38] It has to borrow it
[2629.38 → 2630.28] from verse 21.
[2631.00 → 2631.82] So literally,
[2632.82 → 2634.10] verses 21 and 22
[2634.10 → 2634.82] say this,
[2634.82 → 2637.10] submitting to one another
[2637.10 → 2637.78] out of reverence
[2637.78 → 2638.38] for Christ.
[2639.40 → 2639.74] Now,
[2640.30 → 2641.00] that submitting
[2641.00 → 2642.04] connects to
[2642.04 → 2643.50] earlier up
[2643.50 → 2644.14] where it says,
[2644.52 → 2645.08] do not be drunk
[2645.08 → 2645.62] with wine,
[2645.74 → 2646.44] but be filled
[2646.44 → 2647.24] with the Spirit.
[2647.32 → 2647.98] That's the key word,
[2648.26 → 2649.14] the key verb.
[2649.48 → 2650.28] Filled with the Spirit.
[2650.70 → 2651.18] And then it gives
[2651.18 → 2652.38] a list of five
[2652.38 → 2652.90] parables.
[2653.76 → 2654.06] Singing,
[2654.82 → 2655.64] making music,
[2656.94 → 2657.50] what else was that?
[2657.50 → 2658.20] Being thankful.
[2660.24 → 2660.68] Submitting
[2660.68 → 2662.32] to one another
[2662.32 → 2662.88] out of reverence
[2662.88 → 2663.26] for Christ
[2663.26 → 2663.72] is part of that
[2663.72 → 2664.24] whole list.
[2664.24 → 2665.12] What it looks like
[2665.12 → 2665.52] to be filled
[2665.52 → 2665.94] with the Spirit.
[2666.34 → 2667.16] Submitting to one another
[2667.16 → 2667.68] out of reverence
[2667.68 → 2668.10] for Christ.
[2668.20 → 2668.84] And then it says,
[2669.52 → 2671.00] wives to your own
[2671.00 → 2672.30] husbands as to the Lord.
[2672.86 → 2673.08] Now,
[2673.16 → 2674.14] in our translations,
[2674.30 → 2674.80] it'll bring in
[2674.80 → 2675.62] the verb submit
[2675.62 → 2676.40] just for clarity.
[2678.92 → 2679.28] Why am I,
[2679.62 → 2680.64] so in contrast,
[2681.38 → 2681.92] the husband
[2681.92 → 2683.16] is commanded
[2683.16 → 2684.12] with the imperative
[2684.12 → 2685.44] verb twice
[2685.44 → 2687.04] to love his wife.
[2688.34 → 2688.82] Okay,
[2688.82 → 2690.72] so I think
[2690.72 → 2691.62] that's fascinating.
[2691.62 → 2693.36] fourthly,
[2694.22 → 2694.96] wives submitting
[2694.96 → 2695.70] to their husbands
[2695.70 → 2697.56] is not an indication
[2697.56 → 2698.82] of inferiority.
[2699.48 → 2700.28] It is actually
[2700.28 → 2701.06] Christ-like.
[2702.02 → 2702.90] Wives follow
[2702.90 → 2703.66] in the footsteps
[2703.66 → 2704.56] of Jesus
[2704.56 → 2705.44] described
[2705.44 → 2706.90] in Philippians
[2706.90 → 2707.60] chapter 2
[2707.60 → 2709.70] where it says this,
[2710.40 → 2711.34] in your relationships
[2711.34 → 2712.22] with one another,
[2712.30 → 2712.42] right,
[2712.46 → 2712.58] again,
[2712.64 → 2713.40] talking to the church,
[2713.46 → 2714.14] in your relationships
[2714.14 → 2715.00] with one another,
[2715.24 → 2716.30] have the same mindset
[2716.30 → 2717.22] as Christ Jesus
[2717.22 → 2718.36] who being in the very
[2718.36 → 2719.22] nature God
[2719.22 → 2720.36] did not consider
[2720.36 → 2721.80] equality with God
[2721.80 → 2723.22] something to be used
[2723.22 → 2724.20] to his own advantage.
[2724.78 → 2725.10] Rather,
[2725.24 → 2726.08] he made himself
[2726.08 → 2726.70] nothing
[2726.70 → 2728.24] taking the very
[2728.24 → 2728.70] nature
[2728.70 → 2730.06] of a servant.
[2731.38 → 2731.48] Right,
[2731.56 → 2732.10] so submission
[2732.10 → 2732.74] of the wife
[2732.74 → 2734.08] is a spirit-filled
[2734.08 → 2736.02] act of discipleship
[2736.02 → 2736.80] that follows
[2736.80 → 2737.88] in the footsteps
[2737.88 → 2738.70] of Jesus
[2738.70 → 2739.46] who himself
[2739.46 → 2740.38] did not grasp
[2740.38 → 2741.22] honour
[2741.22 → 2742.86] but gives away
[2742.86 → 2743.34] honour.
[2743.34 → 2746.34] So wives,
[2747.58 → 2748.08] it's one
[2748.08 → 2749.72] practical application
[2749.72 → 2752.08] but really
[2752.08 → 2753.02] this is for all of us.
[2753.12 → 2753.22] You know,
[2753.28 → 2753.66] this is true
[2753.66 → 2754.34] for all of our
[2754.34 → 2755.08] relationships
[2755.08 → 2757.68] and the practical
[2757.68 → 2758.70] application is this,
[2758.72 → 2759.56] just about honour.
[2760.38 → 2761.66] How do you use
[2761.66 → 2762.52] your words
[2762.52 → 2764.18] especially
[2764.18 → 2765.96] in public
[2765.96 → 2768.46] around other people?
[2769.20 → 2770.24] Do you use
[2770.24 → 2771.02] your words
[2771.02 → 2772.58] to uplift
[2772.58 → 2773.46] your husband
[2773.46 → 2775.32] to honour him?
[2777.14 → 2777.66] Now,
[2777.76 → 2778.18] do you know
[2778.18 → 2778.94] what will happen
[2778.94 → 2780.48] if you do that?
[2781.08 → 2781.94] What will happen
[2781.94 → 2782.56] when you speak
[2782.56 → 2783.50] words of honour
[2783.50 → 2784.62] to him?
[2784.82 → 2785.04] Do you know
[2785.04 → 2785.54] what will happen?
[2786.12 → 2786.78] Your husband
[2786.78 → 2788.24] will want to live
[2788.24 → 2789.24] up to those words.
[2790.28 → 2790.50] Right,
[2790.54 → 2791.74] he will be inspired
[2791.74 → 2794.06] to live up
[2794.06 → 2795.26] to these words
[2795.26 → 2795.70] of honour.
[2798.70 → 2799.54] So what would it
[2799.54 → 2799.96] look like
[2799.96 → 2800.76] for you as wives
[2800.76 → 2801.60] to talk about
[2801.60 → 2802.14] your husbands
[2802.14 → 2802.78] in such a way
[2802.78 → 2803.20] that they would
[2803.20 → 2804.02] be inspired
[2804.02 → 2805.38] to live up
[2805.38 → 2806.64] to those words?
[2807.50 → 2808.44] That's one way
[2808.44 → 2809.60] that you submit
[2809.60 → 2810.02] to him
[2810.02 → 2810.94] by denying yourself
[2810.94 → 2811.42] in order that
[2811.42 → 2812.16] he might flourish
[2812.16 → 2813.22] and grow in Christ.
[2813.94 → 2814.76] So now let's
[2814.76 → 2816.00] look at husbands.
[2817.32 → 2818.18] Paul says,
[2818.48 → 2819.30] submit to one another
[2819.30 → 2819.92] out of reverence
[2819.92 → 2820.38] for Christ.
[2820.46 → 2821.22] So then what does
[2821.22 → 2822.02] the submission
[2822.02 → 2822.58] of the husband
[2822.58 → 2823.18] look like?
[2825.08 → 2825.52] Well,
[2825.62 → 2826.08] there is an
[2826.08 → 2827.22] equally arduous
[2827.22 → 2828.26] command to husbands
[2828.26 → 2829.20] in verse 25.
[2829.20 → 2831.40] Husbands,
[2832.18 → 2833.52] love your wives
[2833.52 → 2834.72] just as Christ
[2834.72 → 2835.54] loved the church
[2835.54 → 2836.90] and gave himself
[2836.90 → 2838.30] up for her.
[2839.86 → 2841.24] The very fact
[2841.24 → 2841.82] that Paul
[2841.82 → 2842.56] is issuing
[2842.56 → 2843.50] a command
[2843.50 → 2844.26] to husbands
[2844.26 → 2845.34] is already
[2845.34 → 2847.08] culturally transformative.
[2848.04 → 2849.52] In the Jewish context
[2849.52 → 2850.18] of the time,
[2850.28 → 2850.86] there were plenty
[2850.86 → 2852.62] of instructions
[2852.62 → 2853.66] written
[2853.66 → 2855.22] for how to be
[2855.22 → 2856.22] a good Jewish wife.
[2856.22 → 2857.62] but there was
[2857.62 → 2858.64] almost never
[2858.64 → 2860.10] an exhortation
[2860.10 → 2861.22] for how to be
[2861.22 → 2862.30] a good Jewish husband.
[2863.56 → 2864.50] And not only
[2864.50 → 2865.08] are there
[2865.08 → 2866.22] instructions here
[2866.22 → 2867.60] for the husband
[2867.60 → 2868.36] but the longest
[2868.36 → 2869.78] part of this passage
[2869.78 → 2871.22] is husbands
[2871.22 → 2872.08] being told
[2872.08 → 2872.70] how to help
[2872.70 → 2873.16] their wives
[2873.16 → 2873.72] to flourish.
[2874.40 → 2875.20] And it does not
[2875.20 → 2875.84] take a genius
[2875.84 → 2876.58] to figure out
[2876.58 → 2877.30] why he had
[2877.30 → 2877.62] to spend
[2877.62 → 2878.24] so much time
[2878.24 → 2878.64] on that.
[2880.24 → 2881.16] But notice
[2881.16 → 2881.74] the command.
[2882.04 → 2882.38] In order
[2882.38 → 2883.06] to interpret
[2883.06 → 2883.74] this command,
[2884.20 → 2884.92] we need to think
[2884.92 → 2885.94] about word pairs.
[2886.72 → 2886.88] Okay,
[2886.96 → 2887.62] so word pairs.
[2888.00 → 2889.00] Day and night,
[2889.26 → 2889.44] right?
[2889.82 → 2891.70] Up and down.
[2892.06 → 2893.38] In and out.
[2893.66 → 2893.80] Right?
[2893.82 → 2894.44] These are natural
[2894.44 → 2895.02] word pairs.
[2895.74 → 2896.72] In the ancient world
[2896.72 → 2897.70] and even in today,
[2898.18 → 2898.90] when we hear
[2898.90 → 2899.94] wives submit,
[2900.84 → 2901.46] you would naturally
[2901.46 → 2902.16] think the pairing
[2902.16 → 2902.90] is husbands
[2902.90 → 2905.02] lead,
[2905.38 → 2905.82] probably.
[2906.42 → 2906.66] Right?
[2906.96 → 2907.72] But that's not
[2907.72 → 2908.24] Paul's command.
[2908.34 → 2909.08] He doesn't say that.
[2909.30 → 2910.18] It's not wives submit,
[2910.28 → 2911.04] husbands lead.
[2911.50 → 2912.74] It's wives submit,
[2912.88 → 2913.66] husbands do what?
[2913.66 → 2913.74] Love.
[2914.94 → 2915.54] Love.
[2917.36 → 2918.74] Your concern
[2918.74 → 2919.52] as husbands
[2919.52 → 2920.20] should not be
[2920.20 → 2920.94] to exercise
[2920.94 → 2921.70] your leadership,
[2922.30 → 2923.42] but you should
[2923.42 → 2924.08] exercise
[2924.08 → 2925.48] your love ship.
[2926.02 → 2926.80] It's not about
[2926.80 → 2927.38] putting down
[2927.38 → 2927.82] your foot,
[2927.88 → 2928.52] it's about putting
[2928.52 → 2930.14] down your life.
[2931.14 → 2932.08] That is the
[2932.08 → 2932.74] command
[2932.74 → 2934.38] to husbands.
[2935.80 → 2936.62] What does it
[2936.62 → 2937.32] mean for a husband
[2937.32 → 2939.18] to lay down
[2939.18 → 2939.72] his life
[2939.72 → 2940.18] in love?
[2940.18 → 2941.98] our model
[2941.98 → 2943.86] is Jesus Christ.
[2944.48 → 2945.08] Husbands,
[2945.18 → 2946.46] love your wives
[2946.46 → 2947.48] just as
[2947.48 → 2948.40] Christ
[2948.40 → 2949.78] loved the church
[2949.78 → 2951.64] and gave himself
[2951.64 → 2952.58] up for her.
[2954.02 → 2954.94] So husbands,
[2955.08 → 2955.94] how do you
[2955.94 → 2957.26] use
[2957.26 → 2959.22] your agency?
[2960.38 → 2961.40] Do you use it
[2961.40 → 2962.04] in the manner
[2962.04 → 2963.12] of the Gentiles
[2963.12 → 2964.18] who lord it over
[2964.18 → 2965.10] those under
[2965.10 → 2965.74] their authority?
[2965.74 → 2966.92] or do you
[2966.92 → 2967.44] follow the
[2967.44 → 2968.14] example of
[2968.14 → 2968.86] Jesus who
[2968.86 → 2969.32] said in
[2969.32 → 2969.72] Matthew
[2969.72 → 2971.14] chapter 20
[2971.14 → 2971.82] verse 28,
[2972.32 → 2972.74] he says,
[2972.82 → 2973.66] the son of man
[2973.66 → 2974.14] did not come
[2974.14 → 2975.36] to be served,
[2975.96 → 2976.96] but to
[2976.96 → 2978.52] serve
[2978.52 → 2979.56] and give
[2979.56 → 2980.30] his life
[2980.30 → 2981.46] as a ransom
[2981.46 → 2982.02] for many.
[2982.02 → 2984.64] the call
[2984.64 → 2985.40] here is for
[2985.40 → 2985.82] husbands
[2985.82 → 2986.94] to give
[2986.94 → 2987.40] themselves
[2987.40 → 2987.84] to their
[2987.84 → 2988.30] wives
[2988.30 → 2989.34] so that
[2989.34 → 2989.84] their wives
[2989.84 → 2990.90] might grow
[2990.90 → 2991.80] in wholeness
[2991.80 → 2993.30] and in beauty
[2993.30 → 2993.74] and to be
[2993.74 → 2994.42] nurtured
[2994.42 → 2994.92] towards the
[2994.92 → 2995.80] full glory
[2995.80 → 2997.14] in which
[2997.14 → 2997.68] God has
[2997.68 → 2998.66] created them
[2998.66 → 2999.74] as women.
[3001.18 → 3001.88] The husband's
[3001.88 → 3002.44] whole life
[3002.44 → 3002.98] is now to be
[3002.98 → 3003.64] given to
[3003.64 → 3004.06] using the
[3004.06 → 3004.74] authority that
[3004.74 → 3005.22] his wife
[3005.22 → 3005.90] bestows on
[3005.90 → 3006.36] him
[3006.36 → 3008.58] to cause
[3008.58 → 3009.18] his wife
[3009.18 → 3009.90] to grow
[3009.90 → 3010.48] in the image
[3010.48 → 3010.96] of God.
[3010.96 → 3012.22] You see
[3012.22 → 3013.08] this partnership
[3013.08 → 3014.56] that Paul's
[3014.56 → 3015.16] talking about.
[3017.16 → 3018.00] So that's
[3018.00 → 3018.48] what it looks
[3018.48 → 3018.80] like for
[3018.80 → 3019.34] husbands and
[3019.34 → 3020.16] wives to
[3020.16 → 3020.70] submit to
[3020.70 → 3021.22] one another
[3021.22 → 3021.74] in marriage.
[3021.84 → 3022.40] The wife
[3022.40 → 3023.22] seeks to
[3023.22 → 3023.64] honour,
[3023.94 → 3024.70] to defer,
[3024.88 → 3025.50] to please
[3025.50 → 3026.10] her husband
[3026.10 → 3027.72] before herself,
[3027.96 → 3028.42] to in a
[3028.42 → 3029.12] sense deny
[3029.12 → 3030.40] herself so
[3030.40 → 3030.74] that he
[3030.74 → 3031.42] might flourish.
[3032.18 → 3032.66] And the
[3032.66 → 3033.70] husband seeks
[3033.70 → 3034.80] to nurture
[3034.80 → 3036.16] his wife
[3036.16 → 3036.76] and to
[3036.76 → 3038.02] deny himself
[3038.02 → 3039.50] to love
[3039.50 → 3040.62] her so
[3040.62 → 3041.10] that she
[3041.10 → 3041.38] might
[3041.38 → 3041.88] flourish
[3041.88 → 3043.10] and grow
[3043.10 → 3043.34] in the
[3043.34 → 3043.66] image of
[3043.66 → 3044.04] Christ.
[3046.22 → 3047.20] So remember
[3047.20 → 3047.76] our passage
[3047.76 → 3048.42] begins in
[3048.42 → 3049.18] verse 21.
[3050.34 → 3050.90] Submit to
[3050.90 → 3051.52] one another
[3051.52 → 3051.88] out of
[3051.88 → 3052.20] reverence
[3052.20 → 3052.82] for Christ.
[3054.26 → 3055.30] And that
[3055.30 → 3055.98] phrase,
[3056.98 → 3057.88] out of
[3057.88 → 3058.30] reverence
[3058.30 → 3059.00] for Christ,
[3059.54 → 3060.80] that really
[3060.80 → 3061.56] provides the
[3061.56 → 3062.80] key for
[3062.80 → 3063.48] interpretation.
[3064.30 → 3065.44] It indicates
[3065.44 → 3066.24] the reason,
[3066.88 → 3068.00] the motivation,
[3068.00 → 3068.92] for wives
[3068.92 → 3069.36] and husbands
[3069.36 → 3069.90] to submit
[3069.90 → 3070.22] to one
[3070.22 → 3070.54] another.
[3071.34 → 3072.26] They submit
[3072.26 → 3073.52] as an
[3073.52 → 3074.12] act of
[3074.12 → 3074.94] discipleship,
[3075.68 → 3076.18] out of
[3076.18 → 3076.72] reverence
[3076.72 → 3077.34] for Christ.
[3078.78 → 3079.00] Right?
[3079.04 → 3079.38] One of the
[3079.38 → 3080.06] main features
[3080.06 → 3080.64] of Paul's
[3080.64 → 3081.14] whole letter
[3081.14 → 3081.52] to the
[3081.52 → 3082.02] Ephesians
[3082.02 → 3082.68] is the
[3082.68 → 3083.38] insistence
[3083.38 → 3083.92] that we
[3083.92 → 3084.58] dwell
[3084.58 → 3085.34] with
[3085.34 → 3086.02] Jesus.
[3086.84 → 3087.84] We dwell
[3087.84 → 3088.42] with Jesus
[3088.42 → 3088.84] in this
[3088.84 → 3089.48] intimate
[3089.48 → 3090.66] communion
[3090.66 → 3091.48] with him
[3091.48 → 3092.04] at all
[3092.04 → 3092.62] times in
[3092.62 → 3093.18] every part
[3093.18 → 3093.42] of our
[3093.42 → 3093.82] lives.
[3094.58 → 3095.00] And that
[3095.00 → 3095.40] is why
[3095.40 → 3095.84] Paul is
[3095.84 → 3096.54] so careful
[3096.54 → 3096.86] in this
[3096.86 → 3097.38] passage
[3097.38 → 3099.00] to remind
[3099.00 → 3099.54] both wives
[3099.54 → 3100.04] and husbands
[3100.04 → 3100.70] that Jesus
[3100.70 → 3102.04] is present
[3102.04 → 3103.26] with them
[3103.26 → 3104.34] and that
[3104.34 → 3104.96] their submission
[3104.96 → 3105.38] to one
[3105.38 → 3105.90] another is
[3105.90 → 3106.42] a form
[3106.42 → 3107.20] of intimacy
[3107.20 → 3108.18] with Jesus.
[3109.34 → 3109.84] As we
[3109.84 → 3110.28] submit to
[3110.28 → 3110.78] one another,
[3111.06 → 3111.94] we do so
[3111.94 → 3112.98] in and
[3112.98 → 3113.56] with
[3113.56 → 3114.74] Jesus Christ.
[3115.60 → 3116.34] This is why
[3116.34 → 3116.64] in verse
[3116.64 → 3117.24] 22,
[3117.76 → 3118.08] it says,
[3118.24 → 3118.42] wives,
[3118.52 → 3119.40] submit yourself
[3119.40 → 3120.08] to your own
[3120.08 → 3120.98] husbands as
[3120.98 → 3121.44] you do to
[3121.44 → 3121.90] the Lord.
[3122.68 → 3122.92] Right?
[3122.96 → 3123.32] That doesn't
[3123.32 → 3123.60] mean the
[3123.60 → 3124.06] husbands are
[3124.06 → 3124.88] like Christ,
[3125.34 → 3125.82] stand in,
[3125.84 → 3126.40] for Christ
[3126.40 → 3126.78] to their
[3126.78 → 3127.02] wives.
[3127.12 → 3127.46] It means
[3127.46 → 3127.98] that Jesus
[3127.98 → 3129.22] is there.
[3129.96 → 3130.44] Jesus is
[3130.44 → 3130.90] present.
[3131.60 → 3131.96] And when
[3131.96 → 3132.52] wives submit
[3132.52 → 3132.82] to their
[3132.82 → 3133.60] husbands to
[3133.60 → 3134.04] help him
[3134.04 → 3134.40] flourish,
[3134.52 → 3134.78] they are
[3134.78 → 3135.80] submitting to
[3135.80 → 3136.18] Jesus.
[3136.32 → 3136.88] They're serving
[3136.88 → 3137.30] Jesus.
[3137.44 → 3138.04] They're following
[3138.04 → 3138.58] in Jesus'
[3138.80 → 3139.28] footsteps.
[3140.76 → 3141.28] And that's
[3141.28 → 3142.30] why in
[3142.30 → 3143.16] verse 25,
[3143.42 → 3143.94] husbands are
[3143.94 → 3144.88] told that
[3144.88 → 3145.52] their love
[3145.52 → 3146.26] is a reflection
[3146.26 → 3147.02] of Christ's
[3147.02 → 3147.68] own love.
[3148.20 → 3149.62] As they die
[3149.62 → 3150.02] for their
[3150.02 → 3150.58] wives,
[3151.44 → 3152.16] they're actually
[3152.16 → 3153.34] participating in
[3153.34 → 3153.86] what Jesus
[3153.86 → 3154.52] is doing
[3154.52 → 3155.78] to sanctify
[3155.78 → 3156.48] their wives.
[3159.18 → 3159.42] And so
[3159.42 → 3159.86] what I want
[3159.86 → 3160.34] us to see
[3160.34 → 3160.72] is that
[3160.72 → 3161.20] as we
[3161.20 → 3161.68] submit to
[3161.68 → 3162.24] one another
[3162.24 → 3162.50] in the
[3162.50 → 3163.10] context of
[3163.10 → 3163.48] marriage,
[3164.08 → 3164.66] Jesus is
[3164.66 → 3164.92] there.
[3166.36 → 3166.62] Jesus
[3166.62 → 3168.02] is helping
[3168.02 → 3168.48] us.
[3169.54 → 3170.24] We have
[3170.24 → 3170.82] the pleasure
[3170.82 → 3171.32] of really
[3171.32 → 3172.08] giving ourselves
[3172.08 → 3172.82] to Jesus
[3172.82 → 3173.40] in the midst
[3173.40 → 3173.78] of marriage.
[3173.84 → 3174.02] And that's
[3174.02 → 3174.24] what can
[3174.24 → 3174.58] help us
[3174.58 → 3174.96] do it
[3174.96 → 3175.78] when it's
[3175.78 → 3176.26] so often
[3176.26 → 3176.86] hard to
[3176.86 → 3177.10] do.
[3178.88 → 3179.32] Because
[3179.32 → 3180.74] we're loving
[3180.74 → 3181.22] Jesus.
[3181.22 → 3181.82] we're
[3181.82 → 3182.18] submitting
[3182.18 → 3182.46] to
[3182.46 → 3182.76] Jesus.
[3182.92 → 3183.04] We're
[3183.04 → 3183.42] following
[3183.42 → 3183.84] him.
[3184.86 → 3185.22] And that's
[3185.22 → 3185.54] what gives
[3185.54 → 3185.82] us the
[3185.82 → 3186.98] power to
[3186.98 → 3187.58] lay down
[3187.58 → 3188.12] our lives,
[3188.18 → 3188.68] both husbands
[3188.68 → 3189.40] and wives,
[3189.82 → 3190.34] for the
[3190.34 → 3190.54] other.
[3192.30 → 3192.94] So that's
[3192.94 → 3193.24] the first
[3193.24 → 3193.78] point that I
[3193.78 → 3194.10] wanted us
[3194.10 → 3194.36] to see
[3194.36 → 3194.66] from this
[3194.66 → 3195.08] passage,
[3195.66 → 3196.02] that the
[3196.02 → 3196.34] gospel
[3196.34 → 3197.08] completely
[3197.08 → 3197.80] transforms
[3197.80 → 3198.94] and redeems
[3198.94 → 3199.98] the experience
[3199.98 → 3200.98] of marriage
[3200.98 → 3201.28] that is
[3201.28 → 3201.86] often so
[3201.86 → 3202.24] broken.
[3202.82 → 3203.12] This
[3203.12 → 3203.66] completely
[3203.66 → 3204.66] transforms
[3204.66 → 3205.44] marriage.
[3207.40 → 3208.16] And here's
[3208.16 → 3208.52] the second
[3208.52 → 3208.86] point,
[3209.00 → 3209.38] and this
[3209.38 → 3209.58] will be
[3209.58 → 3209.82] much
[3209.82 → 3210.12] shorter.
[3210.12 → 3211.70] The second
[3211.70 → 3212.82] point is
[3212.82 → 3213.42] that marriage
[3213.42 → 3214.10] reveals the
[3214.10 → 3214.44] gospel.
[3216.44 → 3217.44] So Paul
[3217.44 → 3218.18] is talking
[3218.18 → 3219.68] about husbands
[3219.68 → 3220.44] and wives
[3220.44 → 3221.02] submitting to
[3221.02 → 3221.56] one another.
[3222.34 → 3222.82] And then
[3222.82 → 3224.04] he quotes
[3224.04 → 3225.08] Genesis
[3225.08 → 3225.80] chapter 2
[3225.80 → 3226.50] verse 24,
[3226.98 → 3227.64] which is
[3227.64 → 3228.24] the main
[3228.24 → 3229.60] Old Testament
[3229.60 → 3230.54] passage about
[3230.54 → 3230.98] marriage.
[3232.06 → 3232.56] So in
[3232.56 → 3233.36] verse 31,
[3233.90 → 3234.42] it says
[3234.42 → 3234.88] this,
[3236.10 → 3236.96] for this
[3236.96 → 3237.52] reason,
[3237.68 → 3238.10] a man
[3238.10 → 3238.60] will leave
[3238.60 → 3239.12] his father
[3239.12 → 3239.58] and mother
[3239.58 → 3240.24] and be
[3240.24 → 3240.58] united
[3240.58 → 3240.96] to his
[3240.96 → 3241.28] wife,
[3241.28 → 3242.32] and the
[3242.32 → 3242.96] two will
[3242.96 → 3243.68] become one
[3243.68 → 3244.16] flesh.
[3245.04 → 3246.20] This is a
[3246.20 → 3247.24] profound mystery,
[3247.88 → 3249.00] but I'm
[3249.00 → 3249.62] talking about
[3249.62 → 3251.04] Christ and
[3251.04 → 3251.60] the church.
[3252.76 → 3253.54] In other
[3253.54 → 3254.20] words,
[3254.92 → 3255.46] marriage is
[3255.46 → 3256.02] not about
[3256.02 → 3256.56] marriage.
[3258.16 → 3259.24] Marriage is
[3259.24 → 3259.62] about the
[3259.62 → 3259.94] gospel.
[3260.96 → 3261.16] Right?
[3261.20 → 3261.94] The profound
[3261.94 → 3263.56] mystery is
[3263.56 → 3264.28] what marriage
[3264.28 → 3265.88] shows about
[3265.88 → 3266.42] the gospel.
[3266.42 → 3266.54] gospel.
[3267.30 → 3267.90] And what
[3267.90 → 3268.62] it shows
[3268.62 → 3269.90] is absolutely
[3269.90 → 3270.82] astounding.
[3271.58 → 3272.40] Because in
[3272.40 → 3272.94] Genesis 2
[3272.94 → 3273.40] 24,
[3273.56 → 3274.16] this is right
[3274.16 → 3274.44] at the
[3274.44 → 3274.78] beginning
[3274.78 → 3276.62] of the
[3276.62 → 3277.70] biblical story,
[3277.82 → 3278.14] there is
[3278.14 → 3278.70] absolutely
[3278.70 → 3279.22] this stunning
[3279.22 → 3279.60] statement
[3279.60 → 3280.46] of how
[3280.46 → 3281.08] greatly
[3281.08 → 3281.84] God loves
[3281.84 → 3282.32] us,
[3282.94 → 3283.44] that he
[3283.44 → 3283.96] would move
[3283.96 → 3285.00] towards us,
[3285.50 → 3286.24] how greatly
[3286.24 → 3287.04] a man
[3287.04 → 3288.54] would love
[3288.54 → 3289.26] his bride,
[3289.80 → 3290.28] that he
[3290.28 → 3290.84] would leave
[3290.84 → 3291.46] his father
[3291.46 → 3292.56] to be united
[3292.56 → 3293.38] to his wife.
[3293.38 → 3295.36] Do you see
[3295.36 → 3295.84] what's happening
[3295.84 → 3296.18] here?
[3296.90 → 3297.58] Marriage is a
[3297.58 → 3297.98] picture of
[3297.98 → 3298.28] how the
[3298.28 → 3299.06] God-man,
[3299.20 → 3299.98] Jesus Christ,
[3300.28 → 3300.74] would leave
[3300.74 → 3301.28] his heavenly
[3301.28 → 3303.54] father to
[3303.54 → 3304.20] be united
[3304.20 → 3304.72] to his
[3304.72 → 3305.64] beautiful bride,
[3305.90 → 3306.40] the church.
[3307.78 → 3308.70] This is a
[3308.70 → 3309.24] picture of
[3309.24 → 3309.70] the gospel.
[3310.74 → 3310.78] Right?
[3311.00 → 3311.68] In defying
[3311.68 → 3312.50] all social
[3312.50 → 3313.24] expectations,
[3313.76 → 3314.42] the one true
[3314.42 → 3314.82] and living
[3314.82 → 3315.36] God,
[3315.80 → 3316.16] socially,
[3316.42 → 3316.64] we would
[3316.64 → 3317.42] expect that
[3317.42 → 3318.20] the people
[3318.20 → 3319.14] serve God.
[3319.88 → 3320.22] That's what
[3320.22 → 3320.44] all the
[3320.44 → 3320.98] Greco-Roman
[3320.98 → 3321.76] religions did.
[3322.28 → 3322.82] But here,
[3322.82 → 3323.62] the creator
[3323.62 → 3324.24] of heaven
[3324.24 → 3324.70] and earth,
[3324.78 → 3325.02] the one
[3325.02 → 3325.26] true and
[3325.26 → 3325.84] living God,
[3326.46 → 3326.80] submitted
[3326.80 → 3328.30] himself in
[3328.30 → 3329.74] love to
[3329.74 → 3331.28] marry you
[3331.28 → 3332.14] and me.
[3334.48 → 3335.82] God designed
[3335.82 → 3337.22] marriage to
[3337.22 → 3337.86] reveal the
[3337.86 → 3338.28] mystery of
[3338.28 → 3338.70] the gospel,
[3339.32 → 3339.78] and he
[3339.78 → 3340.30] designed the
[3340.30 → 3341.62] gospel to
[3341.62 → 3342.20] redeem the
[3342.20 → 3342.64] mystery of
[3342.64 → 3343.00] marriage.
[3343.78 → 3344.54] Let's pray.
[3348.64 → 3349.26] Heavenly
[3349.26 → 3349.60] Father,
[3349.86 → 3350.70] what a
[3350.70 → 3351.18] profound
[3351.18 → 3351.58] mystery.
[3352.82 → 3354.22] Father,
[3354.34 → 3355.34] we experience
[3355.34 → 3357.60] the profundity,
[3357.84 → 3358.52] the mystery
[3358.52 → 3359.12] of marriage,
[3359.26 → 3359.44] Lord,
[3360.32 → 3361.48] because so
[3361.48 → 3363.32] often it
[3363.32 → 3365.08] is hard.
[3365.96 → 3367.08] It is hard
[3367.08 → 3367.96] to deny
[3367.96 → 3368.52] ourselves.
[3369.52 → 3370.58] It is hard
[3370.58 → 3372.24] to submit
[3372.24 → 3373.14] ourselves for
[3373.14 → 3373.74] the good of
[3373.74 → 3374.38] another person.
[3374.56 → 3374.98] Lord, we are
[3374.98 → 3376.22] naturally self-centred.
[3377.22 → 3377.74] But Lord,
[3377.78 → 3378.38] we thank you for
[3378.38 → 3379.18] marriage, which is
[3379.18 → 3380.18] the crucible that
[3380.18 → 3381.04] enables us to
[3381.04 → 3381.48] grow in
[3381.48 → 3383.04] Christlikeness by
[3383.04 → 3383.80] not focusing on
[3383.80 → 3384.70] ourselves, but by
[3384.70 → 3386.52] focusing on the
[3386.52 → 3386.76] other.
[3388.82 → 3389.48] And Lord, it's
[3389.48 → 3390.12] also difficult
[3390.12 → 3393.16] because we in
[3393.16 → 3393.64] marriage have
[3393.64 → 3395.06] experienced loss,
[3396.00 → 3396.24] we have
[3396.24 → 3397.10] experienced divorce,
[3398.04 → 3398.44] we have
[3398.44 → 3399.94] experienced perhaps
[3399.94 → 3401.10] abuse, and there
[3401.10 → 3402.08] are singles, Lord,
[3402.18 → 3403.42] who desire to be
[3403.42 → 3403.80] married.
[3405.38 → 3405.62] And so,
[3405.72 → 3406.74] Lord, have mercy.
[3406.74 → 3408.76] Lord, would you
[3408.76 → 3409.68] help us to
[3409.68 → 3410.96] redeem marriage
[3410.96 → 3412.66] as a picture of
[3412.66 → 3413.10] the gospel.
[3413.54 → 3414.12] And Lord, would
[3414.12 → 3414.94] our marriages be
[3414.94 → 3416.24] transformed by the
[3416.24 → 3417.72] gospel so that we
[3417.72 → 3418.68] might live faithfully
[3418.68 → 3420.26] in them to your
[3420.26 → 3421.02] honour and glory.
[3422.56 → 3423.54] We pray in Jesus'
[3423.76 → 3423.94] name.
[3424.22 → 3424.48] Amen.
[3426.04 → 3427.22] Now, our song of
[3427.22 → 3428.70] response today is
[3428.70 → 3430.12] the church's one
[3430.12 → 3430.64] foundation.
[3430.76 → 3431.08] It was kind of
[3431.08 → 3431.46] hard.
[3432.16 → 3432.66] Mel and I were
[3432.66 → 3433.22] talking about it.
[3433.26 → 3433.92] We didn't know what
[3433.92 → 3434.74] song of response we
[3434.74 → 3436.04] should sing for this
[3436.04 → 3436.34] passage.
[3437.06 → 3437.98] But the church's
[3437.98 → 3438.92] one foundation has
[3438.92 → 3439.72] this one stanza.
[3441.20 → 3441.76] It says,
[3441.92 → 3443.14] from heaven he came
[3443.14 → 3444.64] and sought her to
[3444.64 → 3445.82] be his holy bride.
[3446.34 → 3447.38] With his own blood
[3447.38 → 3448.84] he bought her, and
[3448.84 → 3450.28] for her life he
[3450.28 → 3450.58] died.
[3450.66 → 3450.80] Right?
[3450.88 → 3451.38] And that's the
[3451.38 → 3451.90] mystery of the
[3451.90 → 3453.30] gospel that marriage
[3453.30 → 3454.34] demonstrates.
[3454.94 → 3456.20] So let's stand and
[3456.20 → 3458.02] let's sing this song,
[3458.12 → 3458.74] the church's one
[3458.74 → 3459.20] foundation.
[3466.04 → 3482.20] The church's one
[3482.20 → 3486.24] foundation is Jesus
[3486.24 → 3489.18] Christ, her Lord.
[3489.18 → 3492.40] she is his new
[3492.40 → 3496.38] creation, my water
[3496.38 → 3499.46] and the word.
[3499.46 → 3502.82] From heaven he came
[3502.82 → 3506.74] and sought her to be
[3506.74 → 3510.20] his holy bride.
[3510.20 → 3514.08] with his own blood he
[3514.08 → 3518.16] bought her, and for her
[3518.16 → 3521.60] life he died.
[3523.60 → 3528.82] He led from every nation,
[3528.82 → 3533.68] yet one o'er all the earth.
[3533.68 → 3538.78] her charter of salvation,
[3538.78 → 3544.30] one Lord, one faith, one birth.
[3544.30 → 3549.78] one holy name she blesses,
[3550.22 → 3554.58] partings one holy food,
[3555.48 → 3560.14] and to one hope she presses,
[3560.14 → 3565.62] with every grace and doom.
[3568.44 → 3573.46] With toil and tribulation,
[3573.46 → 3574.46] her glory and tribulation,
[3574.46 → 3575.46] and to one hope she sends,
[3575.46 → 3576.46] her glory and tribulation,
[3576.46 → 3578.46] and to one hope she sends,
[3578.46 → 3580.46] she waits the consternation,
[3580.46 → 3583.46] of peace forevermore.
[3583.46 → 3588.46] of peace forevermore.
[3588.46 → 3593.46] Till with the vision glorious,
[3593.46 → 3598.46] her longing eyes are blessed,
[3598.46 → 3602.46] and the great church victory,
[3602.46 → 3604.46] the church victorious,
[3604.46 → 3609.46] shall be the church at rest.
[3609.46 → 3612.46] and the great church at rest.
[3612.46 → 3617.46] Yes, she on earth has union,
[3617.46 → 3622.46] with God the three in one.
[3622.46 → 3626.46] And misty's sweet communion,
[3626.46 → 3631.46] with those whose rest is one.
[3631.46 → 3638.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3638.46 → 3644.46] Lord, give us grace that we,
[3644.46 → 3650.46] like them the meek and lowly,
[3650.46 → 3656.46] may live eternally.
[3656.46 → 3658.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3658.46 → 3659.46] may live eternally.
[3659.46 → 3660.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3660.46 → 3661.46] may live eternally.
[3661.46 → 3662.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3662.46 → 3664.46] may live eternally.
[3664.46 → 3666.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3666.46 → 3667.46] may live eternally.
[3667.46 → 3668.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3668.46 → 3669.46] may live eternally.
[3669.46 → 3675.46] o happy ones and holy,
[3675.46 → 3676.46] will our tithes and offerings.
[3676.46 → 3677.46] O happy ones and holy.
[3677.46 → 3678.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3678.46 → 3679.46] may live eternally.
[3679.46 → 3680.46] O happy ones and holy,
[3680.46 → 3683.46] may live eternally.
[3683.46 → 3684.46] O happy one.
[3684.46 → 3687.88] There's a verse from the Psalms, Psalm 96, that says this,
[3687.88 → 3693.92] Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name, bring an offering, and come into His courts.
[3695.40 → 3699.56] So this time we will continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[3699.76 → 3705.64] Our designated offering for today is for Bethesda.
[3707.54 → 3712.28] Bethesda is a ministry of World Renew, part of our Christian Reformed Church denomination.
[3712.28 → 3717.60] So that's a designated offering, and would the deacons come forward to collect the offering?

[3879.28 → 3885.28] Would you please join me in prayer as we lift the needs, the concerns of
[3885.28 → 3888.28] our world and of our own community.
[3888.28 → 3891.28] Let's pray together.
[3891.28 → 3901.28] Lord, we pray first that you would multiply all of our gifts to serve you in your kingdom's work in the world.
[3901.28 → 3905.28] Lord, we lift to you the ministry of Bethesda House.
[3905.28 → 3915.28] Lord, and pray that through them, you would heal and help, Lord, and bring your love to people who
[3915.28 → 3917.28] need it.
[3917.28 → 3924.28] And Father, we come before you, praising you because you have made all things.
[3924.28 → 3928.28] You providentially govern all things.
[3928.28 → 3931.28] And in Christ, you are redeeming all things.
[3931.28 → 3934.28] Praise be to you.
[3934.28 → 3947.28] Father, we ask that you would show your presence and your compassion in the many places around the world that are experiencing the brokenness and the sin of the world.
[3947.28 → 3953.28] Father, would you please bring order and peace to the chaos of this world.
[3953.28 → 3962.28] We pray for the people of Ukraine, for each person who has been uprooted, displaced, devastated by war.
[3962.28 → 3970.28] We pray for the people of Iran, in this fifth week of protests against tyranny and oppression.
[3970.28 → 3973.28] And we pray for your church in both of those places.
[3973.28 → 3977.28] That your people will continue to hold onto you.
[3977.28 → 3981.28] And would they continue to hope in you?
[3981.28 → 3988.28] Because their life is in you, even in the midst of all that is happening around them.
[3988.28 → 3996.28] Lord, would you enable them by your spirit to be salt and light, bearing witness to you and your kingdom in times of darkness and fear.
[3996.28 → 4001.28] Grant wisdom, we pray, Lord, to the many political leaders.
[4001.28 → 4005.28] Please provide food, shelter and comfort to the desperate.
[4005.28 → 4013.28] And use your church as around the world to be messengers of your kingship and your love.
[4016.28 → 4025.28] Lord Jesus, we pray for the elections in our own cities here that have just finished.
[4025.28 → 4029.28] And Lord, for those new leaders who have been elected.
[4029.28 → 4035.28] Lord, you direct the hearts of kings and princes and those in authority over us politically.
[4035.28 → 4041.28] Lord, would you help them by your wisdom to govern well.
[4041.28 → 4052.28] Lord, that they might through governmental policies enable the flourishing of people made in your image in every area of life.
[4052.28 → 4060.28] Lord Jesus, we pray that you would be near to those who are in anguish, those who are sad, or those who are lonely.
[4061.28 → 4065.28] For those of us who need healing, please touch and heal, good Father.
[4065.28 → 4075.28] Lord, we pray especially for Faux, as she, I believe, is still in the hospital, in ICU for serious health concerns with her heart.
[4075.28 → 4079.28] Lord, we pray for your healing upon her.
[4079.28 → 4084.28] Lord, would you help the doctors to mend what is broken.
[4084.28 → 4087.28] And Lord, would you bring her home in good health.
[4087.28 → 4098.28] Lord, we lift to you Pat Barman, as she was diagnosed with cancer, on top of her kidney problems and so many other things.
[4098.28 → 4102.28] Lord, would you sustain her?
[4102.28 → 4104.28] Would you put your arms around her?
[4104.28 → 4107.28] And Lord, would you heal?
[4107.28 → 4111.28] Lord, we thank you for a doctor that she likes and trusts.
[4111.28 → 4119.28] And Lord, would you help this doctor, Lord, to give the right diagnosis and the right treatment.
[4119.28 → 4131.28] Lord, we continue to lift Quinn to you, Terry and Lori's son-in-law, and their whole family, especially his wife, as he continues to recover from his accident.
[4131.28 → 4141.28] Lord, would you restore full mobility so that he could carry on in life to provide and care for his wife and his family.
[4141.28 → 4160.28] Lord, would you pray for those who are lost, those who do not know you and your love.
[4160.28 → 4163.28] Please bring them to you.
[4163.28 → 4166.28] Father, we pray for marriages in this congregation.
[4166.28 → 4177.28] Lord, for marriages that are fraught with disappointment and frustration and loneliness, would you bring the gospel to transform those marriages.
[4177.28 → 4182.28] For those who have lived through bad marriages or divorces, would you bring healing.
[4182.28 → 4190.28] For those who are missing a loved, beloved spouse who has already died and gone to be in your presence,
[4190.28 → 4193.28] Lord, bring comfort and hope.
[4193.28 → 4202.28] Lord, would you, Lord, strengthen all of our marriages to be a reflection of the gospel and of Jesus' great love for us, his bride.
[4202.28 → 4206.28] Lord, we need your help to be at work in our marriages.
[4206.28 → 4211.28] Lord, we lift to you those who want to be married and who are not.
[4211.28 → 4214.28] Lord, would you also give them your special blessing.
[4214.28 → 4220.28] Lord, give them contentment right now in this place in their lives of singleness.
[4220.28 → 4226.28] And if it is your will, Lord, and it's their heart's desire, would you provide them a spouse.
[4226.28 → 4233.28] But ever faithful God, we thank you for your bride, the church.
[4233.28 → 4240.28] You have knit together as one body in Christ those who have been your people in all times and places.
[4240.28 → 4253.28] Keep us in communion with your saints, following their example of faith and life, until that day when all of your saints will dwell together in the joy of your eternal kingdom.
[4253.28 → 4265.28] In your holy name, with the church on earth and the church in heaven, we ascribe all honour and glory to you now and forever. Amen.
[4265.28 → 4270.28] Brothers and sisters, please stand.
[4270.28 → 4278.28] And we go forth from here with God's last word upon us, his good word, his benediction.
[4278.28 → 4290.28] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the fellowship or the love of God, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all today and forevermore. Amen.
[4290.28 → 4297.28] We will sing our final song. And again, you were invited to join us for a time of coffee and cake in the fellowship hall.
[4297.28 → 4305.28] And especially, I want to encourage everyone to initiate and to welcome those who maybe you don't know as well.
[4305.28 → 4308.28] Okay, please do that and let's sing together.
[4308.28 → 4310.28] Thank you.
[4310.28 → 4311.28] Thank you.
[4311.28 → 4323.28] Thank you.
[4323.28 → 4326.28] Thank you.
[4326.28 → 4332.28] Thank you.
[4332.28 → 4341.28] Thank you.
[4341.28 → 4344.28] Thank you.
[4344.28 → 4350.52] The Lord is born, precious and forgiving.
[4351.68 → 4359.48] Morning star, rising sun, there is none like you.
[4361.32 → 4369.90] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4369.90 → 4379.60] Praise the King of glory, praise him for eternity.
[4381.04 → 4389.88] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4389.88 → 4398.96] Praise the King of glory, praise him for eternity.
[4399.90 → 4401.90] Amen.
[4429.90 → 4435.90] Praise the King of glory, praise the Son.
[4435.90 → 4437.90] Praise the King of glory.
[4437.90 → 4439.90] Amen.
[4439.90 → 4441.90] Amen.
