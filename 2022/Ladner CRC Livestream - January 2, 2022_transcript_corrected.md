[0.00 → 22.30] over ah
[22.30 → 23.30] Amen.
[52.30 → 54.30] Amen.
[82.30 → 84.30] Amen.
[112.30 → 114.30] Amen.
[142.30 → 144.30] Amen.
[172.30 → 174.30] Amen.
[202.30 → 204.30] Amen.
[232.30 → 234.30] Amen.
[262.30 → 264.30] Amen.
[292.30 → 317.32] Good morning.
[317.32 → 318.62] Good morning.
[318.62 → 322.62] And welcome to Ladder Christian Forum Church and a special welcome.
[322.62 → 326.62] If you're visiting with us this morning, we're blessed by your presence,
[326.62 → 328.62] whether it's in person or online,
[328.62 → 332.62] and we pray that we can in turn be a blessing to you.
[332.62 → 335.62] Our offering this morning, again, we won't be passing the plate,
[335.62 → 336.62] but we will have offerings,
[336.62 → 340.62] and that's for the South Delta Meals on Wheels Society.
[340.62 → 343.62] And that's a program under the umbrella of the Delta Assist,
[343.62 → 347.62] and it seeks to provide home-delivered meals to those in our community,
[347.62 → 349.62] that are unable to do so themselves,
[349.62 → 352.62] whether through illness or other reasons.
[352.62 → 354.62] So it's a very worthy one to support.
[354.62 → 357.62] And also, it's a new year,
[357.62 → 360.62] and a lot of programs start up again in January,
[360.62 → 362.62] but there is one new one I wanted to draw your attention to,
[362.62 → 364.62] and that's this listening circle.
[364.62 → 368.62] And this is a new group we're forming this year,
[368.62 → 374.62] and it's in response to the report coming out of Tynan this year on sexuality.
[374.62 → 377.62] And it's a group that's really in the seek-to-understand kind of realm,
[377.62 → 379.62] where we're just trying to understand issues,
[379.62 → 381.62] not necessarily debate them as I understand it,
[381.62 → 383.62] but just try to understand.
[383.62 → 387.62] And that would be a new one that would be worth joining.
[387.62 → 389.62] Sign-up sheets are in the lobby for that,
[389.62 → 392.62] and other programs starting up this year as well.
[395.62 → 397.62] God greets us this morning,
[397.62 → 401.62] and calls us to worship Him with these words from Isaiah 60.
[401.62 → 417.62] Now that God has greeted us, we have a moment to greet each other,
[417.62 → 422.62] and then after that our praise to him is to be.
[422.62 → 424.62] We'll invite them up, they'll lead us in three songs,
[424.62 → 438.62] and I believe John Bester is going to regale us with a 2021 year in review.
[438.62 → 440.62] Thank you.
[440.62 → 442.62] Thank you.
[442.62 → 444.62] Thank you.
[452.62 → 478.62] Thank you.
[478.62 → 496.80] O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
[496.80 → 524.46] Come and behold him, born the king of angels, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
[524.46 → 542.46] Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation, Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above.
[542.46 → 570.46] Glory to God, all glory in the highest, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
[570.46 → 572.46] Amen.
[600.46 → 602.46] Amen.
[602.46 → 604.46] Amen.
[604.46 → 605.46] Amen.
[605.46 → 606.46] Amen.
[606.46 → 608.46] Amen.
[608.46 → 612.46] Amen.
[612.46 → 617.46] Amen.
[617.46 → 621.46] the everlasting god
[621.46 → 625.46] the everlasting god
[625.46 → 629.46] you do not faint you won't
[629.46 → 633.46] grow weary you're the
[633.46 → 637.46] kings and are of the weak
[637.46 → 641.46] you comfort those in me
[641.46 → 645.46] you lift us up on wings
[645.46 → 649.46] like eagles
[649.46 → 653.46] strength will rise
[653.46 → 655.46] as we wait upon
[655.46 → 657.46] the lord
[657.46 → 659.46] we will wait upon
[659.46 → 661.46] the lord

[685.28 → 687.46] everlasting God

[690.74 → 691.46] God
[692.46 → 693.54] you do
[693.54 → 695.24] not faint you
[695.24 → 697.46] won't grow
[697.46 → 698.68] weary
[698.68 → 700.70] you're the
[700.70 → 703.20] defender of the
[703.20 → 704.50] weak
[704.50 → 705.82] you comfort
[705.82 → 707.86] those in me
[707.86 → 710.24] you lift us
[710.24 → 712.42] upon wings
[712.42 → 714.86] like eagles
[714.86 → 736.18] it's been the tradition in this church that on new years which we're celebrating today the new year's first service of the new year is that the clerk presents the new year and the church
[736.18 → 741.28] It's been the tradition in this church that on New Year's, which we're celebrating today,
[741.40 → 746.72] the New Year's first service of the New Year, is that the clerk presents a year in review
[746.72 → 747.58] for our church.
[749.00 → 754.84] And even now, you're expecting a lot because Jake said, I'm going to regale you.
[755.08 → 757.22] So I hope I don't disappoint.
[760.26 → 761.14] Anyway, here it goes.
[761.14 → 764.82] Once again, we as a congregation can testify to God's faithfulness.
[765.38 → 769.92] We were able to hear God's word preached to us each Sunday of this past year.
[770.60 → 775.06] From January to June, we were not able to meet in person due to the pandemic.
[776.02 → 778.64] Our first in-person service was June 6.
[779.38 → 785.20] We are thankful for the faithful preaching and shepherding of Pastor Jason, who has now
[785.20 → 786.88] been our pastor for two years.
[787.66 → 794.80] Some of the sermon series Pastor Jason preached this year were the I Am Sayings of Jesus, On
[794.80 → 802.72] the Cross, a Lenten series, Psalms of Ascent, Sacred Calling, and an Advent series.
[803.30 → 805.74] We have been blessed by Pastor Jason's preaching.
[806.96 → 811.52] Many of our ministries did not meet until September due to the COVID restrictions.
[812.30 → 815.88] In September, friendship, gems, and cadets resumed.
[815.88 → 822.24] A new ministry started this September was a youth group led by Pastor Jason, Lorna Hamming,
[822.40 → 823.96] and Michaela Van Ridge.
[824.74 → 830.12] Two of our long-term ministries will no longer be meeting, ladies' Bible study and single
[830.12 → 831.06] parents' ministry.
[831.90 → 836.12] We would like to acknowledge that those who have led these ministries several for many
[836.12 → 838.84] years, we'd like to thank them.
[839.66 → 842.80] Midweek Bible study is something new that we started in September.
[842.80 → 846.60] This replaces the coffee break and women's Bible study.
[847.62 → 853.18] This Wednesday morning social and study is open to both men and women and is currently
[853.18 → 855.74] being attended by 15 to 20 persons.
[856.32 → 859.72] This is a drop-in study, and we would love to see more participants.
[861.20 → 865.10] In the background, many groups and committees function faithfully.
[865.68 → 871.28] Worship committee, hospitality, maintenance, counting, and new immigrant support.
[871.28 → 877.08] Also singing at Delta Hospital extended care resumed in the fall.
[877.72 → 879.50] Thank you to all those who volunteered.
[880.68 → 886.60] A special thank you to Mel Mass, our treasurer, for keeping our finances and records in such
[886.60 → 887.24] good order.
[888.18 → 890.86] Also extra thanks to our audiovisual team.
[890.86 → 895.28] Without them, we would not have been able to live stream our services.
[895.28 → 902.24] And we appreciate those who serve in the worship ministry of our church, worship leaders, musicians,
[902.50 → 903.24] and vocalists.
[904.04 → 910.18] Ashley Windermere deserves a special thanks for being our worship coordinator, music coordinator
[910.18 → 911.46] for the worship services.
[911.46 → 916.32] Thanks also to our deacons and elders for serving our church.
[917.10 → 921.70] There have been many difficult decisions complying with provincial health guidelines.
[923.06 → 926.88] We were able to take part in three sessions of cross-training this past year.
[927.60 → 931.14] One on anxiety by Zoom, led by Linda SCSI.
[931.14 → 937.62] One on the presence of God in everyday life, led by Pastor Jason, also by Zoom.
[938.26 → 944.00] And then one led by Marion Mandrel on beauty, art, and the kingdom, which was in person.
[945.14 → 951.02] Our associate pastor, Nancy, continues to be a blessing with our Chinese ministry.
[951.02 → 959.84] Her ministry consists of Sunday morning worship, prayer meetings, gospel classes, which lead
[959.84 → 963.70] to baptism, Bible study, and parenting classes.
[964.78 → 971.30] This past year, Pastor Nancy was examined before our classes to become a commissioned pastor in
[971.30 → 971.86] our church.
[973.44 → 978.50] Nancy sustained her examination and was confirmed by a unanimous vote of our classes.
[978.50 → 985.72] Hannah Lao, our children's ministry director, blesses the children with her work with Kids
[985.72 → 986.08] Life.
[986.80 → 993.34] From January to June, Hannah used Zoom to meet with the children, and since then, and since
[993.34 → 995.62] June, the classes have been able to meet in person.
[996.56 → 1001.98] We would like to thank those who are involved in teaching and helping in the Kids Life classes.
[1003.16 → 1007.48] Several people transferred their church membership to our church this past year.
[1007.48 → 1014.70] We would like to thank our students, and we would like to thank our students, and we would like to thank our students, and we would like to thank our students.
[1014.70 → 1020.48] One of the highlights of the year was the many baptisms we were able to witness.
[1021.00 → 1028.02] The original plan was to do all the baptisms on Easter Sunday, but due to meeting limits, these
[1028.02 → 1031.16] were spread out over several Sundays after Easter.
[1031.16 → 1060.52] Children baptized were Anson and Jensen Tsai, Sylvia Wong, Jasper and Adam Sang.
[1060.52 → 1067.00] And just a few weeks ago, we witnessed the baptisms of Jenny Wong and Tracy Hugh.
[1068.36 → 1075.08] Another highlight of Nancy's ministry was the Christian art show and gospel concert this past fall.
[1075.74 → 1081.84] It was well attended with many people coming to our church to see the art and attend the gospel concert.
[1081.84 → 1091.52] Once per month, we now have a family service where we worship together with our Chinese brothers and sisters until it is time for the sermon.
[1092.08 → 1095.14] We celebrate communion together during these services.
[1096.00 → 1100.64] These services are a blessing to all, and all appreciate this communion of the saints.
[1100.64 → 1116.88] We completed our one-year sponsorship of two new immigrant families this year, Valid, Benz, and Bradman, from Iran, and Kikuyu, Salem, Leana, Barchan, and Grace, originally from Ethiopia.
[1116.88 → 1125.32] Both families are still in our communities, and we look forward to being able to continue to help them to transition into life in Canada.
[1126.36 → 1134.36] Our congregation was saddened by the death of two of our long-term members, John Ram and Get Van Mile.
[1134.36 → 1141.34] We take comfort from the psalmist, knowing that the Lord heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[1142.02 → 1147.08] We look forward to the return of Christ, when God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[1148.00 → 1150.90] There shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
[1151.64 → 1155.64] There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.
[1155.98 → 1157.42] That's from Revelation 21.
[1158.50 → 1162.14] Again, we do not know what God has in store for us in 2022.
[1162.14 → 1173.50] We pray that during this year, the pandemic may subside, so that we all will feel safe to resume worshipping in person with our entire congregation.
[1174.66 → 1184.96] We ask God for his continued blessing and care as we grow together in grace, and reach out to our community, especially during this time of the pandemic.
[1185.60 → 1186.10] Thank you.
[1192.14 → 1222.12] Thank you.
[1222.14 → 1224.14] Thank you.
[1224.14 → 1252.12] Thank you.
[1252.14 → 1254.14] Thank you.
[1254.14 → 1255.14] Thank you.
[1255.14 → 1256.14] Thank you.
[1256.14 → 1257.14] Thank you.
[1282.14 → 1290.14] Thank you.
[1312.14 → 1314.00] shine bright.
[1314.34 → 1316.02] Oh, shine
[1316.02 → 1318.20] all around us
[1318.20 → 1320.14] by day and
[1320.14 → 1322.06] by night.
[1322.52 → 1323.20] Jesus,
[1324.10 → 1326.10] the light of the
[1326.10 → 1327.20] world.
[1329.58 → 1331.40] Hail the
[1331.40 → 1332.96] hell, Lord,
[1333.10 → 1334.72] Prince of
[1334.72 → 1337.14] Kings. Jesus,
[1337.14 → 1339.14] the light of
[1339.70 → 1341.14] the world.
[1342.14 → 1344.94] Hail the
[1344.94 → 1346.68] Son of
[1346.68 → 1348.68] Righteousness.
[1350.14 → 1350.80] Jesus,
[1351.66 → 1353.40] the light of
[1353.40 → 1354.82] the world.
[1355.40 → 1356.96] We'll
[1356.96 → 1359.26] walk in the light,
[1360.40 → 1361.18] beautiful
[1361.18 → 1362.68] light.
[1363.78 → 1365.38] Come where
[1365.38 → 1366.76] the dew drops,
[1366.76 → 1369.16] the mercy shine
[1369.16 → 1370.76] bright. Oh,
[1370.76 → 1373.72] shine all around us
[1373.72 → 1375.66] by day and
[1375.66 → 1377.56] by night.
[1377.96 → 1378.66] Jesus,
[1379.50 → 1381.34] the light of
[1381.34 → 1382.50] the world.
[1382.56 → 1382.76] Jesus,
[1382.76 → 1383.44] the light of the world.
[1383.44 → 1384.10] the light of the world.
[1398.10 → 1399.54] Okay, and if you're
[1399.54 → 1401.38] ages 3 through
[1401.38 → 1402.46] grade 7,
[1403.06 → 1403.92] here's your chance.
[1404.20 → 1405.16] You can go to
[1405.16 → 1406.00] Kids Life if you like.
[1406.00 → 1406.74] of course,
[1406.74 → 1407.32] you're welcome to stay
[1407.32 → 1407.86] here as well
[1407.86 → 1408.54] with us.
[1408.54 → 1408.74] But
[1408.74 → 1430.60] please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1430.60 → 1434.56] God of grace,
[1434.86 → 1436.54] you have given us
[1436.54 → 1438.22] Jesus, the light of the world,
[1438.84 → 1440.12] but we choose darkness
[1440.12 → 1442.76] and cling to things that hide the brightness
[1442.76 → 1443.60] of your love.
[1444.56 → 1445.54] Immersed in ourselves,
[1445.74 → 1447.72] we have not risen to new life.
[1449.18 → 1450.72] Baptize us with your spirit
[1450.72 → 1451.22] that,
[1451.78 → 1452.84] forgiven and renewed,
[1453.06 → 1454.58] we may preach your word
[1454.58 → 1455.52] to the nations
[1455.52 → 1457.16] and tell of your glory
[1457.16 → 1458.34] shining in the face
[1458.34 → 1459.22] of Jesus Christ,
[1459.72 → 1460.34] our Lord,
[1460.86 → 1461.54] and our light
[1461.54 → 1462.16] forever.
[1462.80 → 1463.10] Amen.
[1463.10 → 1463.24] Amen.
[1463.24 → 1486.20] Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1486.20 → 1490.36] in the dawning of the King.
[1490.36 → 1494.56] Be the theme of heaven's praises,
[1494.96 → 1497.82] robbing frail humanity.
[1499.12 → 1500.80] In our longing,
[1501.34 → 1503.04] in our darkness,
[1503.52 → 1507.44] now the light of life has come.
[1507.84 → 1511.42] Look to Christ who God descended,
[1512.08 → 1516.14] took on flesh to ransom us.
[1516.14 → 1517.14] Amen.
[1520.36 → 1526.38] Come, behold the wondrous mystery,
[1526.84 → 1530.56] be the perfect Son of man.
[1530.98 → 1532.58] In His living,
[1533.00 → 1534.56] in His suffering,
[1535.10 → 1538.66] never trace nor stain of sin.
[1539.28 → 1543.18] See this rule in the land of
[1543.18 → 1547.40] come to save the human man.
[1547.40 → 1551.50] Christ, the greater sure fulfillment,
[1551.50 → 1556.30] of the law in Him, we stand.
[1561.88 → 1566.28] Come, behold the wondrous mystery,
[1566.28 → 1570.40] Christ the Lord upon the tree.
[1570.40 → 1574.78] Heedless dead of cruel and sinners,
[1574.78 → 1578.28] thanks to them in victory.
[1579.28 → 1582.78] See the price of our redemption,
[1583.46 → 1587.28] see the Father's plan unfold,
[1587.76 → 1591.54] bringing many sons to glory,
[1592.08 → 1595.54] grace on edge and have atoned.
[1595.54 → 1610.42] One John chapter 1 reminds us of the good news of the gospel.
[1611.24 → 1612.18] Hear these words.
[1613.02 → 1615.64] This is the message we have heard from Him
[1615.64 → 1617.10] and proclaim to you,
[1617.50 → 1618.70] that God is light,
[1619.14 → 1621.36] and in Him there is no darkness at all.
[1621.36 → 1624.68] If we say that we have fellowship with Him
[1624.68 → 1626.56] while we are walking in darkness,
[1627.00 → 1630.02] we lie and do not do what is true.
[1630.76 → 1632.24] But if we walk in the light,
[1632.48 → 1634.28] as He Himself is in the light,
[1634.56 → 1636.32] we have fellowship with one another,
[1636.68 → 1638.66] and the blood of Jesus, His Son,
[1639.24 → 1640.58] cleanses us from all sin.
[1640.58 → 1657.54] Come, behold the wondrous mystery,
[1657.96 → 1661.68] slain by death the thought of life,
[1662.06 → 1665.82] but no grave could ever restrain Him,
[1665.82 → 1669.66] praise the Lord, He is alive.
[1669.66 → 1673.94] What a foretaste of deliverance,
[1674.26 → 1677.90] how unwavering our hope,
[1678.30 → 1681.74] Christ in power resurrected,
[1682.34 → 1686.06] as we will be when He comes.
[1686.44 → 1689.66] What a foretaste of deliverance,
[1690.58 → 1694.66] how unwavering our hope,
[1694.66 → 1700.10] Christ in power resurrected,
[1700.10 → 1705.58] as we will be when He comes.
[1724.66 → 1735.74] We're reading Scripture from Revelations 22,
[1736.20 → 1737.34] verse 12 to 20.
[1738.30 → 1740.06] Look, I am coming soon.
[1740.48 → 1741.90] My reward is with me,
[1742.14 → 1743.84] and I will give each person
[1743.84 → 1745.46] according to what they have done.
[1745.98 → 1747.74] I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[1748.30 → 1749.52] the first and the last,
[1749.52 → 1750.72] the beginning and the end.
[1750.72 → 1753.74] Blessed are those who wash their robes,
[1753.80 → 1754.88] that they may be right,
[1755.32 → 1757.02] have the right to the tree of life,
[1757.20 → 1759.52] and may go through the gates into the city.
[1760.46 → 1761.58] Outside are the dogs,
[1761.68 → 1763.36] those who practice magic arts,
[1763.86 → 1764.78] sexually immoral,
[1764.92 → 1765.64] the murderers,
[1766.00 → 1766.74] the adulterers,
[1766.82 → 1768.00] and everyone who loves
[1768.00 → 1769.36] and practices falsehood.
[1770.18 → 1770.82] I, Jesus,
[1771.18 → 1772.90] have sent my angel to give you
[1772.90 → 1774.50] this testimony to the churches.
[1774.50 → 1776.26] I am the root
[1776.26 → 1777.90] and the offspring of David,
[1778.30 → 1779.84] the bright and morning star.
[1781.08 → 1782.52] The Spirit and the bride say,
[1782.70 → 1782.92] Come,
[1783.74 → 1785.48] and let him who says,
[1785.86 → 1786.14] Come,
[1786.38 → 1788.06] let the one who is thirsty,
[1788.36 → 1788.60] come,
[1789.14 → 1790.20] let the one who wishes
[1790.20 → 1791.48] to take these gifts
[1791.48 → 1793.22] to the waters of life.
[1794.22 → 1796.30] I warn everyone who hears the word
[1796.30 → 1798.28] of the prophecy of this scroll,
[1798.54 → 1800.10] if anyone adds to them,
[1800.40 → 1802.14] the Lord will add to that person
[1802.14 → 1804.22] the plagues described in this scroll.
[1804.98 → 1806.58] If anyone takes the words away
[1806.58 → 1807.90] from the scroll of prophecy,
[1808.60 → 1810.28] God will take away from that person
[1810.28 → 1812.18] any share of the tree of life
[1812.18 → 1813.90] and in the holy city
[1813.90 → 1815.90] which is described in this scroll.
[1816.92 → 1818.84] He who testifies these things says,
[1819.20 → 1821.10] Yes, I am coming soon.
[1821.72 → 1822.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[1822.98 → 1823.98] Amen.
[1834.50 → 1837.04] Good morning.
[1838.92 → 1842.32] So as John reminded us
[1842.32 → 1843.16] and reminded me,
[1843.40 → 1845.74] I have been here for two years.
[1847.02 → 1849.88] Since January 1st, 2020.
[1850.66 → 1851.94] So two years in a day.
[1856.46 → 1857.38] Well, thank you.
[1857.38 → 1860.56] Praise the Lord.
[1862.40 → 1864.40] It's been a topsy-turvy two years,
[1865.20 → 1866.28] but at the same time,
[1866.32 → 1867.26] just hearing all the things
[1867.26 → 1868.32] that God has been at work in,
[1868.36 → 1871.36] I'm just delighted to be with you
[1871.36 → 1873.98] and to see the way God has been doing
[1873.98 → 1875.10] all these amazing things.
[1875.46 → 1876.98] So it's been good to review
[1876.98 → 1878.86] God's mercies to us.
[1878.86 → 1882.26] So we have for the past several weeks
[1882.26 → 1883.38] been in a sermon series
[1883.38 → 1885.26] called Come Lord Jesus.
[1885.74 → 1886.46] Come Lord Jesus.
[1887.34 → 1888.38] We've been studying
[1888.38 → 1890.56] some of the New Testament letters
[1890.56 → 1892.48] and what they tell us
[1892.48 → 1894.84] about Jesus' future return.
[1895.58 → 1896.42] The second advent
[1896.42 → 1898.96] that we are all waiting for
[1898.96 → 1901.34] and longing for as God's children.
[1901.56 → 1903.28] We're waiting for Jesus to return.
[1904.80 → 1907.38] So now today we have one last sermon
[1907.38 → 1908.32] in this series
[1908.32 → 1909.20] because it is still
[1909.20 → 1910.14] the season of Christmas
[1910.14 → 1912.42] until we get to Epiphany
[1912.42 → 1914.34] and that's why we have the trees up
[1914.34 → 1915.30] and it's why we still sing
[1915.30 → 1916.24] some Christmas songs.
[1917.78 → 1919.18] And the sermon today
[1919.18 → 1919.98] is going to come,
[1920.08 → 1921.68] as it was read for us,
[1921.88 → 1925.10] from the last chapter of the Bible.
[1926.16 → 1928.30] And it's a word that we all need to hear
[1928.30 → 1930.58] because it's a word of assurance
[1930.58 → 1932.46] that Jesus speaks to us.
[1933.38 → 1934.26] Do you hear that Jesus
[1934.26 → 1936.08] in that passage
[1936.08 → 1937.64] is speaking to us?
[1938.32 → 1940.00] And he gives us a word of assurance
[1940.00 → 1942.04] as we wait for him.
[1942.82 → 1944.20] So let me pray for us
[1944.20 → 1946.46] and then let's hear this word of assurance.
[1948.22 → 1949.04] Heavenly Father,
[1950.04 → 1951.38] we are your people
[1951.38 → 1952.18] and we are waiting.
[1953.98 → 1956.10] Lord, we join your people,
[1956.94 → 1958.72] the church around the world
[1958.72 → 1959.70] and throughout the centuries
[1959.70 → 1960.66] who have been waiting
[1960.66 → 1962.04] and crying out
[1962.04 → 1964.64] for you to come
[1964.64 → 1966.28] and to set all things right,
[1966.28 → 1968.32] to heal and renew all things,
[1968.54 → 1970.72] to reign over all.
[1971.88 → 1975.00] Father, we join that chorus
[1975.00 → 1976.50] and we also lift our cry
[1976.50 → 1978.64] that you would come.
[1979.06 → 1980.32] But Lord, we thank you that
[1980.32 → 1982.36] even as we wait,
[1982.44 → 1983.74] you have poured out your Holy Spirit.
[1983.96 → 1984.66] And so we ask,
[1985.04 → 1985.54] Holy Spirit,
[1985.60 → 1986.90] that you would illumine our hearts,
[1986.90 → 1988.90] that you would teach us more
[1988.90 → 1989.98] what it means for us
[1989.98 → 1991.06] to be a people who wait.
[1992.06 → 1992.58] And Lord,
[1992.62 → 1993.78] would you speak to us
[1993.78 → 1994.64] this morning,
[1994.78 → 1995.64] each one of us.
[1996.20 → 1998.44] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1998.88 → 1999.20] Amen.
[2000.66 → 2001.68] So when I was growing up,
[2001.74 → 2002.48] there was a song
[2002.48 → 2003.20] as, you know,
[2003.24 → 2004.28] as we're riding in the car
[2004.28 → 2004.82] with my dad
[2004.82 → 2006.08] that we would hear fairly often
[2006.08 → 2007.76] on the radio.
[2007.76 → 2009.32] And it's a song called
[2009.32 → 2010.56] Cats in the Cradle.
[2011.24 → 2012.58] Does anyone know this song?
[2013.14 → 2014.48] Yes, probably many of you do.
[2015.52 → 2017.06] It's a song about a child
[2017.06 → 2018.68] that says, you know,
[2019.20 → 2019.62] he asks,
[2019.68 → 2020.66] when are you coming home, Dad?
[2021.82 → 2023.20] And the dad will answer,
[2023.40 → 2024.34] I don't know when,
[2024.86 → 2026.48] but we'll be together then.
[2027.22 → 2028.20] And it's a story
[2028.20 → 2029.66] about how the child grows up
[2029.66 → 2031.38] longing for his dad
[2031.38 → 2032.10] to come home
[2032.10 → 2033.20] and spend time with him.
[2033.68 → 2036.38] And it's a really sad song.
[2037.38 → 2037.50] Right?
[2037.76 → 2039.34] And it speaks to something
[2039.34 → 2040.96] a lot of us can relate to,
[2041.16 → 2042.78] that no matter how much
[2042.78 → 2044.72] we try to arrange our time,
[2044.96 → 2045.98] no matter how much
[2045.98 → 2047.64] we work to be present,
[2048.14 → 2049.48] there's still those times,
[2049.56 → 2052.08] even more than we would hope,
[2052.82 → 2054.72] when we hear those words,
[2055.46 → 2057.28] Daddy, when are you coming home?
[2058.28 → 2058.48] Right?
[2058.60 → 2061.18] Will you come home, please?
[2063.00 → 2064.94] And so when I leave the house
[2064.94 → 2066.36] in the morning
[2066.36 → 2067.34] or different times,
[2067.34 → 2069.10] my daughter Gabby
[2069.10 → 2070.84] and I will often have
[2070.84 → 2071.66] this interaction,
[2071.80 → 2073.60] this kind of call and response.
[2074.98 → 2075.92] First it will be,
[2076.70 → 2076.92] you know,
[2076.94 → 2077.78] she sees me kind of
[2077.78 → 2078.58] getting my shoes ready,
[2078.66 → 2078.94] she'll say,
[2079.02 → 2079.66] Dad, where are you going?
[2080.98 → 2081.78] Can I come?
[2082.92 → 2083.92] And sometimes,
[2084.04 → 2085.14] if I'm just going out
[2085.14 → 2085.80] on an errand,
[2085.92 → 2086.18] I'll say,
[2086.26 → 2087.02] sure, you can come.
[2087.28 → 2087.44] Right?
[2087.46 → 2088.28] And this is very exciting.
[2088.28 → 2090.26] But sometimes,
[2090.38 → 2090.54] you know,
[2090.54 → 2091.52] I'm going to work
[2091.52 → 2092.54] or I'm going to a meeting
[2092.54 → 2093.70] or something like that,
[2094.42 → 2094.74] and then,
[2094.82 → 2096.32] do you know what the next question is?
[2096.88 → 2097.50] She says,
[2098.10 → 2098.50] well,
[2098.54 → 2099.48] when are you coming home?
[2100.44 → 2101.36] And I'll say,
[2101.50 → 2102.54] don't worry,
[2103.28 → 2104.26] I'll be home soon.
[2105.74 → 2107.02] And those few words,
[2107.08 → 2107.82] when are you coming home?
[2107.90 → 2108.80] I'll be home soon.
[2109.52 → 2111.46] They actually mean a lot to me,
[2111.50 → 2112.66] and I like to console myself
[2112.66 → 2114.08] that they mean a lot to her as well.
[2115.20 → 2116.66] Because they assure us
[2116.66 → 2117.96] that this waiting
[2117.96 → 2120.12] is soon going to be over.
[2120.68 → 2120.90] Right?
[2120.94 → 2121.60] And that the life
[2121.60 → 2122.82] that we both long for,
[2122.90 → 2123.84] which is to be together,
[2123.96 → 2124.90] will soon be the life
[2124.90 → 2126.72] that we can have
[2126.72 → 2128.30] and enjoy together.
[2129.42 → 2131.30] And the reason I'm talking about this
[2131.30 → 2132.30] is that this is
[2132.30 → 2134.42] kind of what is going on
[2134.42 → 2135.86] in our passage today.
[2136.70 → 2138.52] So let me tell you about the church.
[2138.80 → 2140.38] That first received
[2140.38 → 2141.54] this letter
[2141.54 → 2143.32] of the book of Revelation.
[2143.48 → 2144.54] Actually, it's a group of churches.
[2145.34 → 2146.56] And so this group of churches,
[2146.56 → 2147.46] they were going through
[2147.46 → 2148.42] a hard time.
[2149.28 → 2150.32] On the one hand,
[2150.82 → 2152.46] they had seen the glory of God.
[2153.72 → 2155.88] They know that Jesus
[2155.88 → 2157.30] is raised from the dead.
[2157.42 → 2159.48] They know that Jesus forgives sins.
[2160.14 → 2162.04] They know that he is ultimately
[2162.04 → 2163.60] going to triumph over evil.
[2163.86 → 2164.76] And that one day,
[2164.86 → 2166.06] he's going to come
[2166.06 → 2167.00] and he's going to make
[2167.00 → 2167.96] everything new.
[2168.80 → 2170.52] But on the other hand,
[2170.64 → 2171.56] they are a church
[2171.56 → 2172.58] that is struggling
[2172.58 → 2175.04] with all kinds of grief.
[2175.60 → 2177.12] Because of their faith,
[2177.92 → 2179.34] because of their own allegiance
[2179.34 → 2182.44] to Jesus as Lord and King,
[2182.88 → 2184.34] they are being slandered.
[2184.78 → 2185.70] They are suffering.
[2185.88 → 2186.82] They're being scattered
[2186.82 → 2187.82] throughout the world.
[2188.20 → 2189.88] A lot of them are sliding away
[2189.88 → 2190.84] from their faith.
[2191.34 → 2192.22] And their pastor,
[2192.36 → 2193.22] the Apostle John,
[2193.38 → 2194.78] is writing this letter
[2194.78 → 2195.96] from exile.
[2195.96 → 2197.08] He is not with them.
[2198.08 → 2199.82] And so their own lives
[2199.82 → 2201.26] as Christians in the world
[2201.26 → 2201.88] is characterized
[2201.88 → 2203.68] by this distress
[2203.68 → 2204.98] that they're all experiencing.
[2205.54 → 2206.92] There's this painful gap
[2206.92 → 2209.28] between what they want
[2209.28 → 2211.44] and what they currently have.
[2212.80 → 2214.10] And their longing
[2214.10 → 2216.08] is expressed in this cry,
[2216.20 → 2216.92] this plea,
[2217.92 → 2219.88] come, Lord Jesus.
[2219.88 → 2222.70] Will you come, please?
[2224.58 → 2227.36] And for those of us
[2227.36 → 2228.42] who are Christians
[2228.42 → 2229.38] here this morning,
[2229.82 → 2232.14] we also have this cry.
[2233.42 → 2235.26] We want Jesus to come back.
[2235.74 → 2237.76] We just want him to come
[2237.76 → 2241.12] and to make our lives different.
[2242.30 → 2242.98] You know, sometimes
[2242.98 → 2245.30] we look at our own hearts
[2245.30 → 2247.58] and we see the selfishness
[2247.58 → 2248.30] inside of us.
[2248.38 → 2249.36] We see our addictions,
[2249.72 → 2250.36] all the stuff
[2250.36 → 2251.28] that we struggle with
[2251.28 → 2251.72] and we think,
[2251.80 → 2252.68] Jesus, I just need you
[2252.68 → 2253.90] to come back right now
[2253.90 → 2255.54] and fix me.
[2257.76 → 2259.06] Other times, you know,
[2259.12 → 2260.68] we just get so tired
[2260.68 → 2261.78] of feeling like
[2261.78 → 2264.28] God isn't here.
[2265.34 → 2265.60] Right?
[2265.64 → 2267.12] We just want his presence.
[2267.24 → 2268.06] We just want to be able
[2268.06 → 2269.20] to see him,
[2269.26 → 2270.46] to see his face.
[2270.94 → 2271.94] And so we have this cry
[2271.94 → 2272.68] inside of us,
[2272.76 → 2273.60] Jesus, would you just
[2273.60 → 2274.28] please come?
[2275.18 → 2277.08] Let us see you
[2277.08 → 2277.94] just for a second.
[2278.98 → 2279.10] Right?
[2279.18 → 2280.22] Why, you know,
[2280.26 → 2281.26] we pray with the psalmist,
[2281.38 → 2282.24] why do you seem
[2282.24 → 2283.76] so far off?
[2286.50 → 2288.08] And so we have
[2288.08 → 2289.38] these struggles within us.
[2289.58 → 2290.16] We want Jesus
[2290.16 → 2291.06] to come and change us
[2291.06 → 2291.86] and we also just want
[2291.86 → 2292.90] him to be with us
[2292.90 → 2295.00] and into this situation
[2295.00 → 2296.82] that we all experience,
[2297.82 → 2299.50] all the promises of God
[2299.50 → 2300.30] that we see
[2300.30 → 2301.76] throughout the entire Bible
[2301.76 → 2303.44] come down to this
[2303.44 → 2304.44] one phrase
[2304.44 → 2306.28] that Jesus says to us
[2306.28 → 2307.56] two times in this passage.
[2308.86 → 2309.40] Did you notice
[2309.40 → 2310.08] what it is?
[2311.08 → 2311.70] He says,
[2312.36 → 2313.40] I am coming soon.
[2314.76 → 2316.60] I am coming soon.
[2317.12 → 2317.66] And friends,
[2317.76 → 2319.06] the whole Bible
[2319.06 → 2320.82] essentially
[2320.82 → 2322.66] kind of boils down
[2322.66 → 2324.60] to that one phrase.
[2325.44 → 2326.86] It's Jesus' word
[2326.86 → 2327.44] of assurance
[2327.44 → 2328.60] to his people
[2328.60 → 2329.34] who are waiting
[2329.34 → 2330.14] for him to come.
[2331.60 → 2332.14] And so what I want
[2332.14 → 2332.72] to do this morning
[2332.72 → 2333.22] is I just want
[2333.22 → 2335.80] to look at that phrase
[2335.80 → 2337.00] and I want to talk
[2337.00 → 2337.72] about what it means
[2337.72 → 2338.36] when Jesus says,
[2338.52 → 2339.28] I am coming soon.
[2339.36 → 2340.74] What does Jesus intend
[2340.74 → 2342.60] to assure us of
[2342.60 → 2344.96] when he says that to us?
[2345.96 → 2347.32] When we hear Jesus say,
[2347.40 → 2348.26] I'm coming soon,
[2348.30 → 2349.20] what is he trying
[2349.20 → 2350.28] to assure us of?
[2351.28 → 2352.56] And in this passage,
[2353.02 → 2354.10] Jesus said it twice.
[2354.66 → 2355.36] I don't know if you noticed,
[2355.58 → 2356.34] in verse 12,
[2356.48 → 2356.78] look,
[2356.82 → 2357.76] I am coming soon.
[2358.06 → 2358.94] And then right at the end
[2358.94 → 2359.52] of verse 20,
[2360.34 → 2361.30] I am coming soon.
[2362.38 → 2363.26] He says it twice.
[2363.38 → 2363.92] And so what I want
[2363.92 → 2364.38] to do is look
[2364.38 → 2365.46] at two different aspects
[2365.46 → 2367.56] of what this promise is,
[2367.60 → 2368.80] this assuring promise
[2368.80 → 2369.94] that he gives to us.
[2370.12 → 2370.86] There's a lot more
[2370.86 → 2372.14] going on in this passage
[2372.14 → 2372.92] that, you know,
[2372.94 → 2373.76] we can't cover everything,
[2373.86 → 2374.40] but this is the way
[2374.40 → 2375.02] I want to look at it
[2375.02 → 2375.44] this morning.
[2377.10 → 2378.18] And so the first is this.
[2378.20 → 2378.94] When Jesus says,
[2379.02 → 2379.86] I am coming soon,
[2379.88 → 2380.76] what he is doing
[2380.76 → 2382.82] is he is assuring us
[2382.82 → 2384.50] that he will renew
[2384.50 → 2385.08] his people.
[2386.36 → 2387.76] And that is our first point.
[2387.76 → 2388.82] There it is.
[2389.60 → 2389.76] Okay.
[2389.92 → 2392.38] God promises to renew you.
[2393.80 → 2395.84] God promises to renew me.
[2396.18 → 2398.68] He promises to renew us.
[2399.62 → 2401.06] Now, one of the amazing things
[2401.06 → 2402.26] about this passage,
[2402.82 → 2405.44] in a truly masterful way,
[2405.64 → 2408.04] John is tying the entire story
[2408.04 → 2408.90] of the Bible together.
[2409.50 → 2410.42] In this passage,
[2410.62 → 2413.34] he is drawing back to Genesis
[2413.34 → 2414.80] and he is showing,
[2414.88 → 2415.70] you see all the imagery
[2415.70 → 2416.90] of the tree of life.
[2416.90 → 2419.34] all of these things.
[2419.42 → 2420.42] And he's bringing them
[2420.42 → 2422.14] right into the very last chapter
[2422.14 → 2422.80] of the Bible.
[2423.48 → 2424.74] And he's showing us
[2424.74 → 2425.42] and demonstrating
[2425.42 → 2427.16] how in one final act
[2427.16 → 2428.32] of God's grace,
[2428.84 → 2430.14] God will restore
[2430.14 → 2431.60] everything lost in the fall.
[2432.26 → 2433.68] And he's going to bring it together
[2433.68 → 2434.80] under the full
[2434.80 → 2435.98] and the beautiful reign
[2435.98 → 2437.28] of Jesus Christ.
[2438.56 → 2440.08] And so that is what John's doing.
[2440.22 → 2441.54] So let me remind you
[2441.54 → 2443.24] of the story of the Bible.
[2443.76 → 2444.98] That's what I want to do this morning.
[2444.98 → 2447.40] The Bible begins
[2447.40 → 2448.98] with God.
[2449.94 → 2452.02] And it begins with a God
[2452.02 → 2453.20] whose glory
[2453.20 → 2455.86] we cannot even imagine.
[2456.74 → 2456.96] Right?
[2457.00 → 2458.52] You just can't imagine
[2458.52 → 2459.72] the glory
[2459.72 → 2461.14] of God.
[2461.96 → 2462.64] And yet,
[2462.76 → 2463.60] God chooses
[2463.60 → 2465.08] to place an image
[2465.08 → 2466.18] of his glory
[2466.18 → 2467.46] in the world.
[2468.14 → 2469.16] And do you know what it is?
[2469.20 → 2470.12] What is the image
[2470.12 → 2470.80] of God's glory
[2470.80 → 2471.36] in the world?
[2471.36 → 2474.68] It's you.
[2475.64 → 2476.36] It's me.
[2477.12 → 2477.70] It's people.
[2477.80 → 2478.22] The glory
[2478.22 → 2479.40] that we can't fully imagine
[2479.40 → 2480.16] is image
[2480.16 → 2480.98] in the people
[2480.98 → 2482.14] that God has made.
[2482.22 → 2483.72] And when God made people,
[2484.04 → 2484.90] he made us
[2484.90 → 2486.00] with glory.
[2486.56 → 2487.22] And he made us
[2487.22 → 2487.94] with dignity
[2487.94 → 2488.78] and beauty
[2488.78 → 2490.24] as human beings.
[2491.66 → 2492.50] But the Bible
[2492.50 → 2493.06] tells us
[2493.06 → 2494.04] that because of sin,
[2494.14 → 2494.84] this image
[2494.84 → 2495.82] of God
[2495.82 → 2497.02] that we all have
[2497.02 → 2497.86] was marred.
[2497.86 → 2499.66] It wasn't lost,
[2500.10 → 2502.22] but it was tarnished.
[2503.50 → 2504.16] And so now,
[2505.16 → 2507.08] we who were supposed
[2507.08 → 2508.92] to govern creation
[2508.92 → 2510.52] as God's stewards
[2510.52 → 2511.16] in the world
[2511.16 → 2512.52] are now actually,
[2512.76 → 2513.90] we're not governing
[2513.90 → 2514.92] anything hardly,
[2515.08 → 2516.06] we are enslaved
[2516.06 → 2517.70] to all kinds of things.
[2518.54 → 2519.46] And now the dignity
[2519.46 → 2521.04] that we were created with,
[2521.16 → 2522.96] we often doubt
[2522.96 → 2524.22] that it is even there.
[2524.22 → 2527.92] But the Bible
[2527.92 → 2528.46] tells us
[2528.46 → 2529.82] that God loves us.
[2529.96 → 2530.56] God loves you.
[2531.18 → 2532.56] And he loves his people
[2532.56 → 2533.48] and he promises
[2533.48 → 2534.68] that he is going
[2534.68 → 2536.18] to renew his people.
[2536.58 → 2537.18] He is going
[2537.18 → 2538.16] to restore
[2538.16 → 2539.60] his image in you.
[2540.54 → 2541.70] And that is a part
[2541.70 → 2542.24] of the theme
[2542.24 → 2543.00] that's going on
[2543.00 → 2544.36] in the entire Bible.
[2545.34 → 2546.68] In the Old Testament,
[2547.12 → 2548.02] this is what God
[2548.02 → 2548.48] is doing.
[2548.78 → 2549.54] He is intending
[2549.54 → 2550.30] to renew
[2550.30 → 2551.46] his people.
[2552.32 → 2553.14] So when he comes
[2553.14 → 2554.16] and he makes
[2554.16 → 2554.88] a covenant
[2554.88 → 2556.00] with Abraham,
[2556.62 → 2557.56] when he gathers
[2557.56 → 2558.18] a people
[2558.18 → 2559.48] from slavery
[2559.48 → 2560.14] and Exodus
[2560.14 → 2561.08] and then makes them
[2561.08 → 2562.36] into a nation,
[2563.00 → 2564.04] when he gives them
[2564.04 → 2564.92] his law
[2564.92 → 2565.58] to teach them
[2565.58 → 2566.28] how to live
[2566.28 → 2567.10] as his people,
[2567.78 → 2568.22] and then when he
[2568.22 → 2569.46] establishes his kingdom
[2569.46 → 2570.16] through David
[2570.16 → 2571.38] and the kings
[2571.38 → 2572.04] that follow,
[2572.96 → 2574.02] then when he gives
[2574.02 → 2575.74] this prophetic image
[2575.74 → 2576.98] of these dry bones
[2576.98 → 2578.30] rising up
[2578.30 → 2579.32] and becoming alive
[2579.32 → 2580.46] again with the joy
[2580.46 → 2581.04] of God,
[2581.04 → 2582.98] this is an image
[2582.98 → 2583.58] of people
[2583.58 → 2584.76] being remade
[2584.76 → 2585.64] by God.
[2587.78 → 2588.58] But let me ask
[2588.58 → 2589.10] you a question.
[2590.44 → 2591.28] When we come
[2591.28 → 2591.76] to the end
[2591.76 → 2592.66] of the Old Testament,
[2593.80 → 2595.08] were we remade?
[2597.54 → 2598.02] No.
[2599.16 → 2600.70] Because as the Old Testament
[2600.70 → 2601.16] ends,
[2601.30 → 2602.00] people were still
[2602.00 → 2603.02] waiting to be renewed.
[2603.78 → 2604.02] Right?
[2604.06 → 2605.02] They're still struggling
[2605.02 → 2606.04] with all kinds
[2606.04 → 2606.88] of idolatry
[2606.88 → 2607.82] and violence
[2607.82 → 2608.66] and injustice.
[2608.66 → 2611.78] So the New Testament
[2611.78 → 2612.44] opens up
[2612.44 → 2613.10] and all of a sudden
[2613.10 → 2613.90] Jesus comes
[2613.90 → 2614.62] and one of the things
[2614.62 → 2615.28] he says is,
[2615.64 → 2616.54] I am here
[2616.54 → 2617.36] to make you new.
[2618.36 → 2619.28] And this is why
[2619.28 → 2620.22] he begins to gather
[2620.22 → 2620.80] his disciples.
[2621.28 → 2621.98] This is an image
[2621.98 → 2623.00] of the regathering
[2623.00 → 2623.48] of Israel.
[2624.30 → 2625.16] This is why he
[2625.16 → 2626.86] comes, and he forgives
[2626.86 → 2627.26] sin.
[2627.84 → 2628.66] This is why Jesus
[2628.66 → 2629.66] comes, and he removes
[2629.66 → 2630.82] shame from people.
[2631.42 → 2632.70] This is why he heals
[2632.70 → 2633.44] people's bodies.
[2634.08 → 2634.98] It's why he raises
[2634.98 → 2635.94] people from the dead
[2635.94 → 2636.72] and he pours out
[2636.72 → 2637.56] his Holy Spirit
[2637.56 → 2638.76] on people.
[2639.50 → 2640.72] Because he is committed
[2640.72 → 2642.36] to renewing you
[2642.36 → 2643.18] and renewing me
[2643.18 → 2644.40] and renewing all of us.
[2646.10 → 2646.72] And so let me ask
[2646.72 → 2647.20] you a question.
[2648.62 → 2649.64] Is anybody
[2649.64 → 2650.82] in this room
[2650.82 → 2653.38] fully renewed?
[2655.84 → 2656.56] If you are,
[2656.62 → 2657.26] I'd love to meet you.
[2659.18 → 2659.62] No.
[2660.76 → 2661.46] Or not.
[2662.24 → 2662.84] And I know
[2662.84 → 2663.40] what that's like
[2663.40 → 2664.44] because I am
[2664.44 → 2665.94] a long way
[2665.94 → 2666.80] from being
[2666.80 → 2667.48] fully renewed.
[2668.80 → 2670.20] We're still waiting,
[2670.40 → 2670.80] aren't we?
[2671.88 → 2672.62] We're still waiting
[2672.62 → 2673.24] to be renewed.
[2674.46 → 2675.06] And part of what
[2675.06 → 2675.56] this passage
[2675.56 → 2676.30] is telling us
[2676.30 → 2677.38] is to assure us
[2677.38 → 2678.34] that our waiting
[2678.34 → 2679.28] is not in vain.
[2679.68 → 2681.12] Because in this passage
[2681.12 → 2681.96] Jesus says,
[2682.18 → 2683.04] I am going
[2683.04 → 2684.38] to renew you.
[2685.12 → 2686.22] And we see that
[2686.22 → 2687.28] in verse 14.
[2688.40 → 2689.08] It says,
[2689.08 → 2690.42] Blessed are those
[2690.42 → 2692.10] who wash their robes
[2692.10 → 2693.76] in the blood of the Lamb,
[2693.84 → 2694.90] as earlier Revelation
[2694.90 → 2695.56] tells us,
[2695.80 → 2697.06] that they may have
[2697.06 → 2697.68] the right
[2697.68 → 2698.84] to the tree of life
[2698.84 → 2699.94] and may go through
[2699.94 → 2700.56] the gates
[2700.56 → 2702.08] into the city.
[2703.10 → 2703.60] See,
[2703.68 → 2704.08] this is
[2704.08 → 2705.84] an image
[2705.84 → 2706.32] that we are
[2706.32 → 2707.52] invited into the city.
[2707.94 → 2708.84] But where are
[2708.84 → 2709.56] our sins?
[2711.20 → 2712.16] They're outside
[2712.16 → 2712.70] the city,
[2712.78 → 2713.14] aren't they?
[2714.12 → 2715.00] And we are made
[2715.00 → 2715.54] clean
[2715.54 → 2716.32] by the blood
[2716.32 → 2717.10] of Christ.
[2717.10 → 2718.56] And we have access
[2718.56 → 2719.30] to the tree
[2719.30 → 2720.14] of life again.
[2720.48 → 2721.36] And this is the image
[2721.36 → 2722.00] of a people
[2722.00 → 2723.30] who are now renewed
[2723.30 → 2725.36] by the work
[2725.36 → 2726.46] of Jesus Christ.
[2727.40 → 2728.04] That all of this
[2728.04 → 2728.72] waiting
[2728.72 → 2730.42] to be renewed
[2730.42 → 2731.32] as God's people
[2731.32 → 2733.48] will be realized.
[2734.54 → 2735.78] That we will be renewed.
[2737.18 → 2737.98] And this is
[2737.98 → 2738.60] God's assurance
[2738.60 → 2739.16] to you.
[2739.66 → 2740.16] Jesus says,
[2740.32 → 2741.12] I am coming soon
[2741.12 → 2742.10] and when I do
[2742.10 → 2742.58] I am going
[2742.58 → 2743.42] to renew my people.
[2744.30 → 2745.80] I want you
[2745.80 → 2746.64] to be assured
[2746.64 → 2747.14] of that.
[2748.80 → 2749.24] And so friends,
[2749.30 → 2749.78] this morning,
[2749.98 → 2751.48] maybe you're
[2751.48 → 2752.64] struggling with doubt
[2752.64 → 2753.46] over whether
[2753.46 → 2754.36] you can finally
[2754.36 → 2754.94] be renewed.
[2757.80 → 2758.04] You know,
[2758.10 → 2758.74] I think almost,
[2758.98 → 2759.16] you know,
[2759.24 → 2760.12] a day doesn't go by
[2760.12 → 2760.96] when I think,
[2761.96 → 2763.74] how am I still
[2763.74 → 2764.86] struggling with this thing?
[2764.92 → 2765.40] I'm struggling
[2765.40 → 2766.64] with this relationship,
[2766.80 → 2767.60] with this desire.
[2768.60 → 2769.42] When am I going
[2769.42 → 2770.02] to be renewed?
[2772.42 → 2773.88] But listen to these words.
[2773.88 → 2776.24] in Christ,
[2777.04 → 2778.24] you will be renewed.
[2779.92 → 2780.56] And so that's
[2780.56 → 2781.10] the first thing.
[2781.20 → 2782.66] But there's a second thing.
[2782.74 → 2783.44] There's more than that.
[2783.52 → 2784.88] But for our purposes
[2784.88 → 2785.40] this morning,
[2785.48 → 2786.40] there's a second thing,
[2787.44 → 2788.42] a second part here.
[2788.42 → 2789.62] When Jesus says,
[2789.76 → 2790.46] I am coming soon,
[2790.50 → 2791.58] it's not just about
[2791.58 → 2792.62] a people being renewed.
[2792.62 → 2794.38] it's also about
[2794.38 → 2795.16] God's presence
[2795.16 → 2795.86] being restored.
[2796.56 → 2798.44] And this is the best part.
[2799.06 → 2800.34] Because the presence
[2800.34 → 2801.66] that God restores
[2801.66 → 2804.00] is his own presence.
[2805.20 → 2806.80] And that is what we want,
[2806.86 → 2807.20] isn't it?
[2807.40 → 2808.40] This is what you want
[2808.40 → 2808.96] as a woman
[2808.96 → 2809.74] or a man
[2809.74 → 2811.12] more than anything else,
[2811.12 → 2812.48] is to be in God's presence.
[2812.88 → 2813.58] That's what you want,
[2813.64 → 2815.14] whether you realize it
[2815.14 → 2815.58] or not.
[2816.94 → 2817.64] So friends,
[2817.74 → 2818.50] remember the Bible
[2818.50 → 2819.36] begins with God.
[2819.36 → 2820.80] Father,
[2821.16 → 2821.34] Son,
[2821.40 → 2822.12] and Holy Spirit.
[2822.88 → 2825.42] Before anything else existed,
[2825.54 → 2826.52] before God created
[2826.52 → 2828.60] the universe
[2828.60 → 2829.90] from all eternity,
[2830.30 → 2831.78] he is the only one present.
[2832.56 → 2834.10] There is nothing else present.
[2835.32 → 2836.90] And when he made us,
[2837.58 → 2838.72] he made us
[2838.72 → 2840.64] for his presence.
[2841.74 → 2842.58] It was God.
[2842.96 → 2844.26] And then he created us
[2844.26 → 2846.50] so that he would be with us
[2846.50 → 2847.56] and that we would be with him.
[2847.62 → 2848.70] That's what we were made for.
[2848.70 → 2849.90] That we would be
[2849.90 → 2850.74] in God's presence.
[2851.38 → 2852.26] And God creates
[2852.26 → 2853.18] the world
[2853.18 → 2854.24] and he creates a garden.
[2854.40 → 2855.02] It's called Eden,
[2855.16 → 2856.16] which means delight.
[2857.04 → 2858.34] And it's in this garden
[2858.34 → 2859.44] that God intends
[2859.44 → 2860.92] to dwell forever
[2860.92 → 2862.64] with his people.
[2863.66 → 2864.90] And this is telling us
[2864.90 → 2866.94] that God is your true home.
[2868.24 → 2869.70] That you were made
[2869.70 → 2872.32] to dwell with God.
[2873.34 → 2874.66] And that is why
[2874.66 → 2875.96] sin is so terrible.
[2875.96 → 2879.42] because when we rejected God
[2879.42 → 2880.72] as our home,
[2880.80 → 2882.16] our true and ultimate home,
[2882.40 → 2885.12] we were actually exiled
[2885.12 → 2885.98] from his presence.
[2886.44 → 2888.38] We lost the presence of God.
[2888.48 → 2889.58] That's what sin did to us.
[2889.82 → 2890.54] And because we are
[2890.54 → 2891.78] no longer with God,
[2892.12 → 2893.16] human beings now
[2893.16 → 2894.58] in a fundamental sense,
[2894.64 → 2895.44] in a deep way,
[2895.74 → 2897.00] are truly homeless.
[2897.36 → 2898.58] And we all feel that.
[2899.42 → 2901.28] We feel like we're wanderers.
[2902.26 → 2903.22] We're always seeking.
[2903.36 → 2904.14] We're always searching
[2904.14 → 2906.14] to attain something,
[2906.26 → 2907.14] to be somewhere,
[2907.22 → 2908.84] to find our true home.
[2909.20 → 2910.52] Our home is meant
[2910.52 → 2911.24] to be with God.
[2911.64 → 2912.96] And that eludes us.
[2914.24 → 2915.92] But God loves you.
[2916.68 → 2917.76] And because of his love,
[2917.82 → 2918.58] the Bible tells us
[2918.58 → 2919.72] not only that God wants
[2919.72 → 2921.42] you to dwell with him,
[2921.72 → 2923.10] but he wants to dwell
[2923.10 → 2923.98] with you.
[2925.20 → 2926.42] So much, in fact,
[2926.48 → 2927.54] that he intends
[2927.54 → 2928.72] to come and dwell
[2928.72 → 2930.06] with humanity.
[2930.06 → 2930.18] humanity.
[2930.92 → 2931.44] And again,
[2931.50 → 2932.56] this is part of the story
[2932.56 → 2933.48] of the entire Bible.
[2934.06 → 2935.34] And when we read
[2935.34 → 2935.98] the Old Testament,
[2936.12 → 2936.22] you know,
[2936.26 → 2937.02] which can always be
[2937.02 → 2938.56] so confusing.
[2938.68 → 2939.48] How does this whole thing
[2939.48 → 2940.02] go together?
[2940.14 → 2941.40] How do all these stories connect?
[2942.04 → 2942.86] I want you to have
[2942.86 → 2943.88] this lens in mind
[2943.88 → 2945.44] that God is seeking
[2945.44 → 2946.12] to be present
[2946.12 → 2947.20] with his people again.
[2948.50 → 2949.56] That's why God
[2949.56 → 2951.54] sits with Abraham and Sarah
[2951.54 → 2953.18] at their table
[2953.18 → 2954.86] and shares a meal with them.
[2955.64 → 2956.74] That's why God comes
[2956.74 → 2957.46] and he wrestles
[2957.46 → 2958.68] with Jacob in the dark.
[2960.06 → 2962.50] This is why he leads Israel
[2962.50 → 2964.58] as a pillar of fire.
[2965.68 → 2967.06] That's why his glory
[2967.06 → 2969.14] descends on the temple
[2969.14 → 2970.40] and fills the temple.
[2971.44 → 2973.18] It's why he speaks
[2973.18 → 2974.08] through the mouths
[2974.08 → 2974.98] of his prophets.
[2975.48 → 2976.92] Because in the Old Testament,
[2977.48 → 2978.98] God intends to restore
[2978.98 → 2980.22] his presence to his people.
[2981.40 → 2983.36] God makes a covenant with us.
[2983.36 → 2985.06] And he says,
[2985.38 → 2986.78] I will take you
[2986.78 → 2988.44] as my own people
[2988.44 → 2990.92] and I will be your God.
[2991.82 → 2994.30] He comes, and he establishes
[2994.30 → 2995.54] a covenantal relationship
[2995.54 → 2996.18] with us.
[2997.02 → 2998.50] It's not based on us
[2998.50 → 2999.24] and what we can do
[2999.24 → 2999.78] or accomplish.
[3000.06 → 3001.38] It's based on his promises
[3001.38 → 3002.26] and his character.
[3004.12 → 3005.56] But let me ask you a question.
[3005.66 → 3007.22] Does this fully happen
[3007.22 → 3008.04] in the Old Testament?
[3008.04 → 3010.24] Are God's people
[3010.24 → 3011.32] fully restored
[3011.32 → 3012.06] to God's presence?
[3012.96 → 3014.58] No, they're not.
[3015.44 → 3016.88] And one of the saddest parts
[3016.88 → 3017.44] of the Bible
[3017.44 → 3018.32] is that the Old Testament
[3018.32 → 3019.02] actually ends
[3019.02 → 3019.80] in the book of Malachi
[3019.80 → 3021.50] with God's people
[3021.50 → 3023.30] not dwelling with God
[3023.30 → 3024.90] but instead
[3024.90 → 3026.42] living in exile
[3026.42 → 3029.14] away from God's presence.
[3029.14 → 3032.16] But then what happens?
[3033.04 → 3034.72] The New Testament opens up
[3034.72 → 3036.30] and John,
[3037.44 → 3038.96] the author of Revelation,
[3039.18 → 3040.38] in the first chapter
[3040.38 → 3041.62] of the Gospel,
[3041.78 → 3042.28] he says,
[3042.48 → 3043.98] now God has come
[3043.98 → 3045.10] to dwell with us
[3045.10 → 3046.34] in Jesus Christ.
[3046.68 → 3046.86] Right?
[3046.90 → 3047.70] He says the word,
[3048.26 → 3048.94] the eternal word
[3048.94 → 3049.42] that existed
[3049.42 → 3050.38] from all eternity
[3050.38 → 3052.50] has made,
[3052.96 → 3054.08] has taken on flesh
[3054.08 → 3056.60] and he now dwells with us.
[3057.20 → 3057.84] That's Jesus.
[3057.84 → 3059.66] Jesus offers
[3059.66 → 3060.24] the promise
[3060.24 → 3061.34] of God's presence
[3061.34 → 3062.64] fully restored to us.
[3063.58 → 3063.90] And friends,
[3064.14 → 3065.04] that is why Jesus
[3065.04 → 3066.44] left the glory of heaven
[3066.44 → 3067.64] and he entered
[3067.64 → 3068.74] into a human womb.
[3069.76 → 3070.72] This is why Jesus
[3070.72 → 3072.04] took on flesh
[3072.04 → 3074.30] and was born in a manger
[3074.30 → 3075.04] as we celebrate
[3075.04 → 3075.48] in Christmas.
[3075.60 → 3076.74] He came to be
[3076.74 → 3078.10] with us.
[3079.12 → 3080.32] This is why he then
[3080.32 → 3081.64] gathered and called
[3081.64 → 3082.98] disciples to follow him.
[3083.44 → 3084.32] This is why he
[3084.32 → 3085.24] ate with sinners
[3085.24 → 3086.52] and this is why
[3086.52 → 3087.28] he went to weddings
[3087.28 → 3087.86] and dinners.
[3088.86 → 3089.88] It's why he entered
[3089.88 → 3090.90] into human suffering
[3090.90 → 3091.44] and death
[3091.44 → 3092.84] and it's why he
[3092.84 → 3093.86] was raised
[3093.86 → 3095.00] as a human being
[3095.00 → 3095.90] and then he pours
[3095.90 → 3096.66] out his spirit
[3096.66 → 3098.06] into human hearts
[3098.06 → 3099.76] because God
[3099.76 → 3100.86] wants to dwell with you.
[3101.94 → 3102.86] He wants to restore
[3102.86 → 3104.02] his presence to you
[3104.02 → 3106.20] and your presence
[3106.20 → 3106.82] to him.
[3108.12 → 3108.60] Friends,
[3108.68 → 3109.32] do you know this morning
[3109.32 → 3109.96] that God wants
[3109.96 → 3110.54] to be with you?
[3110.54 → 3113.48] If that's all you hear
[3113.48 → 3113.94] this morning,
[3114.06 → 3114.48] hear that.
[3115.46 → 3117.72] God wants to be with you.
[3119.30 → 3120.38] But let me ask you,
[3121.00 → 3122.92] is your experience
[3122.92 → 3124.70] of God's presence
[3124.70 → 3126.64] as full as you want it to be?
[3129.14 → 3129.58] Right?
[3129.70 → 3131.12] Is your experience
[3131.12 → 3132.46] of God's presence today
[3132.46 → 3134.78] as full as it will
[3134.78 → 3136.28] one day be?
[3136.28 → 3137.48] Right?
[3137.56 → 3138.38] Are any of us
[3138.38 → 3139.80] totally content
[3139.80 → 3140.82] with our experience
[3140.82 → 3141.52] of God's presence
[3141.52 → 3142.12] in our lives?
[3143.18 → 3143.74] No.
[3145.36 → 3145.96] Right?
[3146.02 → 3146.38] Actually,
[3146.54 → 3147.78] so often we feel
[3147.78 → 3149.58] half-driven crazy
[3149.58 → 3151.14] by the sense
[3151.14 → 3152.26] of his absence.
[3154.80 → 3155.82] But Jesus
[3155.82 → 3157.64] spoke these words.
[3157.74 → 3158.26] The purpose
[3158.26 → 3159.08] of this passage
[3159.08 → 3160.20] is to assure you
[3160.20 → 3161.70] and to assure us
[3161.70 → 3163.70] that God will
[3163.70 → 3164.52] in time
[3164.52 → 3165.62] restore his presence
[3165.62 → 3166.10] to you
[3166.10 → 3167.66] in a way
[3167.66 → 3168.70] that you can see.
[3169.80 → 3169.92] Right?
[3169.98 → 3170.64] So in verse 4,
[3170.70 → 3171.46] we didn't read it,
[3171.54 → 3172.90] but earlier in chapter 22
[3172.90 → 3173.54] in verse 4,
[3173.92 → 3175.20] this is what it says.
[3175.30 → 3175.68] He says,
[3175.90 → 3177.96] they will see his face.
[3179.94 → 3181.66] They will see his face
[3181.66 → 3183.32] and his name
[3183.32 → 3185.08] will be on their foreheads.
[3185.86 → 3186.08] Right?
[3186.12 → 3187.28] We will finally see him.
[3188.34 → 3189.44] Faith will give way
[3189.44 → 3190.02] to sight.
[3190.02 → 3191.66] We will be
[3191.66 → 3192.60] reunited
[3192.60 → 3194.40] to God forever.
[3194.52 → 3195.64] We will dwell with him.
[3196.62 → 3197.96] And then in verses 17
[3197.96 → 3198.56] and 20
[3198.56 → 3199.28] in our passage,
[3199.42 → 3200.28] we cry our
[3200.28 → 3200.98] for him to come
[3200.98 → 3201.92] and what does Jesus
[3201.92 → 3202.60] finally say?
[3204.12 → 3205.16] I am coming.
[3206.84 → 3207.82] I am coming.
[3209.60 → 3210.12] Right?
[3210.18 → 3210.80] We experience
[3210.80 → 3211.66] that absence.
[3212.46 → 3212.94] We say,
[3213.06 → 3213.44] come,
[3214.30 → 3214.56] Jesus.
[3215.14 → 3215.74] And he says,
[3215.80 → 3216.52] I am coming.
[3216.92 → 3217.78] I'm on my way.
[3217.84 → 3218.84] I'm going to be with you.
[3218.84 → 3219.48] My presence
[3219.48 → 3220.20] is going to be
[3220.20 → 3221.52] restored to you.
[3221.64 → 3222.84] This is the essential
[3222.84 → 3224.46] assurance of this passage
[3224.46 → 3225.68] that one day
[3225.68 → 3226.50] God will restore
[3226.50 → 3227.46] his presence to us.
[3228.52 → 3228.92] And so friends,
[3228.96 → 3229.96] when you hear these words
[3229.96 → 3230.60] in this passage,
[3231.06 → 3232.34] I am coming soon,
[3233.34 → 3234.46] it's Jesus saying
[3234.46 → 3235.20] to us
[3235.20 → 3236.38] that I am coming
[3236.38 → 3237.22] and when I come
[3237.22 → 3238.18] I am going to
[3238.18 → 3239.32] renew my people.
[3239.82 → 3240.76] All the sin
[3240.76 → 3242.16] that we struggle with
[3242.16 → 3243.54] is going to be
[3243.54 → 3244.28] finally
[3244.28 → 3246.14] taken away from us.
[3246.14 → 3246.84] We are going to be
[3246.84 → 3247.68] with God
[3247.68 → 3249.18] in the new creation,
[3249.32 → 3250.26] in the new Jerusalem
[3250.26 → 3252.06] and we're going
[3252.06 → 3252.62] to be with him.
[3253.28 → 3254.06] I'm going to restore
[3254.06 → 3254.62] my presence.
[3255.36 → 3256.00] And he says,
[3256.10 → 3256.86] I am coming.
[3257.66 → 3258.88] I am coming.
[3260.78 → 3261.52] And so friends,
[3261.56 → 3262.22] that's the assurance
[3262.22 → 3264.42] that Jesus gives us here.
[3264.74 → 3265.86] In the very last
[3265.86 → 3266.96] verses of the Bible,
[3267.38 → 3268.04] Jesus Christ,
[3268.16 → 3268.86] the one who is risen
[3268.86 → 3269.48] from the dead,
[3269.62 → 3270.74] speaks to you and me
[3270.74 → 3271.74] from the future
[3271.74 → 3272.56] and tells us,
[3272.80 → 3274.96] I will be back soon.
[3275.96 → 3276.62] And the life
[3276.62 → 3277.70] that we long for,
[3278.06 → 3279.28] which is to be together,
[3279.52 → 3280.60] will be the life
[3280.60 → 3281.80] that we have.
[3284.26 → 3285.04] So lastly,
[3285.20 → 3285.76] what does that mean
[3285.76 → 3286.36] for us today?
[3287.34 → 3288.38] What does this mean
[3288.38 → 3291.08] for how we live
[3291.08 → 3292.00] and how we wait
[3292.00 → 3292.70] as a people?
[3293.00 → 3294.38] We are a waiting people.
[3294.48 → 3295.78] That's what we are
[3295.78 → 3296.50] reminded of
[3296.50 → 3297.50] in this season of Advent.
[3298.62 → 3299.86] That we are a waiting people.
[3300.30 → 3301.56] We're waiting for Jesus
[3301.56 → 3303.20] to come home.
[3304.90 → 3305.86] And this passage
[3305.86 → 3306.50] in Revelation
[3306.50 → 3307.86] clarifies for us
[3307.86 → 3309.02] what we are waiting for.
[3309.38 → 3310.74] We're waiting to be renewed
[3310.74 → 3312.28] as his people.
[3312.74 → 3313.22] We are being,
[3313.34 → 3314.08] we're waiting to
[3314.08 → 3316.12] have his presence
[3316.12 → 3317.02] renewed to us.
[3317.68 → 3318.38] But you know what?
[3318.62 → 3319.60] The good news, friends,
[3319.64 → 3320.46] is not only that
[3320.46 → 3321.56] this is a future promise
[3321.56 → 3322.22] that's going to happen,
[3322.34 → 3323.58] but that this is something
[3323.58 → 3325.44] that we don't have to wait for,
[3325.52 → 3326.48] but that we can experience
[3326.48 → 3326.96] right now.
[3327.74 → 3328.56] So look with me
[3328.56 → 3329.32] at verse 17.
[3331.56 → 3332.48] There it is.
[3333.08 → 3333.66] It's,
[3334.02 → 3335.46] the Bible ends
[3335.46 → 3338.36] with this beautiful invitation.
[3339.42 → 3340.24] This is what it says.
[3340.66 → 3341.30] The Spirit
[3341.30 → 3342.70] and the Bride
[3342.70 → 3343.58] say come.
[3343.84 → 3345.04] The Bride is the church,
[3345.16 → 3346.12] the Holy Spirit.
[3346.42 → 3347.40] Through the church,
[3348.02 → 3348.72] empowering us
[3348.72 → 3350.10] to cry out and say,
[3350.64 → 3351.10] come.
[3351.90 → 3352.12] Right?
[3352.18 → 3353.16] We're praying for Jesus
[3353.16 → 3353.58] to come.
[3353.84 → 3355.20] Let the one who hears
[3355.20 → 3356.28] say come.
[3356.28 → 3356.72] Now,
[3356.72 → 3358.58] now it switches.
[3360.04 → 3361.24] Let the one
[3361.24 → 3362.74] who is thirsty
[3362.74 → 3363.28] come.
[3363.42 → 3364.00] It's kind of a
[3364.32 → 3365.28] we're crying out to Jesus.
[3365.40 → 3365.60] Now,
[3365.80 → 3366.62] this is an invitation
[3366.62 → 3367.48] to us.
[3368.20 → 3369.06] Not for Jesus
[3369.06 → 3369.66] to come to us,
[3369.70 → 3370.12] but for us
[3370.12 → 3370.94] to come to Jesus.
[3371.70 → 3372.28] Let the one
[3372.28 → 3372.72] who is thirsty
[3372.72 → 3373.16] come.
[3373.24 → 3373.68] Let the one
[3373.68 → 3374.20] who wishes
[3374.20 → 3375.74] take the gift
[3375.74 → 3376.40] of the water
[3376.40 → 3377.72] of life.
[3378.42 → 3378.96] And notice
[3378.96 → 3379.68] that this is
[3379.68 → 3380.32] in the present.
[3381.20 → 3381.82] This is saying
[3381.82 → 3382.36] that anyone
[3382.36 → 3383.06] who is thirsty
[3383.06 → 3383.64] is invited
[3383.64 → 3384.30] to come
[3384.30 → 3385.30] and receive
[3385.30 → 3386.16] from God
[3386.16 → 3386.82] the water
[3386.82 → 3387.42] of life.
[3388.34 → 3389.42] This is a gift
[3389.42 → 3390.22] that is available
[3390.22 → 3391.56] to us right now.
[3392.38 → 3392.58] Right?
[3392.64 → 3393.64] You don't have to wait
[3393.64 → 3394.86] for Jesus to return.
[3396.52 → 3397.58] And Jesus said
[3397.58 → 3398.12] this himself,
[3398.22 → 3398.60] didn't he?
[3399.02 → 3400.52] In John chapter 4,
[3400.98 → 3401.48] Jesus said,
[3401.58 → 3402.32] whoever drinks
[3402.32 → 3403.68] the water I give
[3403.68 → 3404.14] them
[3404.14 → 3405.66] will never thirst
[3405.66 → 3407.40] in the present.
[3408.52 → 3408.88] Indeed,
[3408.98 → 3409.94] the water I give
[3409.94 → 3410.86] them will become
[3410.86 → 3411.34] in them
[3411.34 → 3412.46] a spring of water
[3412.46 → 3413.10] welling up
[3413.10 → 3414.04] to eternal life.
[3415.10 → 3415.20] Right?
[3415.26 → 3416.32] The water of life
[3416.32 → 3418.20] that belongs
[3418.20 → 3419.40] in the new creation
[3419.40 → 3420.58] is available
[3420.58 → 3421.68] already
[3421.68 → 3422.80] in the present
[3422.80 → 3424.48] to all of us
[3424.48 → 3425.94] who heed
[3425.94 → 3426.68] this invitation
[3426.68 → 3427.60] to come to Jesus.
[3429.28 → 3430.28] Or as John,
[3430.42 → 3431.36] or as Jesus says
[3431.36 → 3432.22] in John 15,
[3432.72 → 3433.38] he says,
[3433.50 → 3434.50] I am the vine,
[3434.88 → 3435.86] you are the branches.
[3436.60 → 3438.26] If you remain
[3438.26 → 3438.90] in me
[3438.90 → 3440.80] and I in you,
[3441.06 → 3441.58] you will bear
[3441.58 → 3442.08] much fruit
[3442.08 → 3443.10] apart from me,
[3443.30 → 3444.64] you can do nothing.
[3445.58 → 3446.66] What's he saying here?
[3448.66 → 3449.64] If you remain
[3449.64 → 3450.12] in me,
[3450.48 → 3451.72] we can remain
[3451.72 → 3452.44] in Jesus
[3452.44 → 3453.04] right now.
[3454.52 → 3455.40] Are you talking about,
[3455.44 → 3455.96] he's talking about
[3455.96 → 3456.62] his presence.
[3456.76 → 3458.02] Apart from me,
[3458.24 → 3459.46] you cannot have
[3459.46 → 3460.16] any life in you.
[3460.24 → 3461.22] You cannot bear fruit,
[3461.62 → 3463.26] but if you remain
[3463.26 → 3463.96] in me,
[3464.04 → 3464.52] you will bear
[3464.52 → 3465.08] much fruit.
[3465.24 → 3465.92] What does that mean?
[3465.92 → 3466.88] It's an invitation.
[3469.46 → 3470.92] It's inviting Jesus
[3470.92 → 3472.66] to plant
[3472.66 → 3473.96] that imperishable seed
[3473.96 → 3474.74] of eternal life
[3474.74 → 3475.76] in your soul
[3475.76 → 3477.26] so that a new man,
[3477.34 → 3477.88] a new woman,
[3477.96 → 3478.66] a new child
[3478.66 → 3479.52] can become
[3479.52 → 3480.96] to start to grow in us.
[3481.50 → 3482.84] As we receive
[3482.84 → 3484.22] the life of Jesus,
[3484.66 → 3485.62] as we root
[3485.62 → 3486.92] our life
[3486.92 → 3487.84] in his love,
[3488.22 → 3488.84] as we are
[3488.84 → 3489.76] connected with him,
[3489.82 → 3491.38] as a little branch
[3491.38 → 3491.98] you are connected
[3491.98 → 3492.50] with Jesus
[3492.50 → 3493.38] as the vine,
[3493.88 → 3494.56] what happens?
[3495.74 → 3496.28] His fruit
[3496.28 → 3497.28] starts to grow in you.
[3497.94 → 3498.78] His life
[3498.78 → 3499.82] starts to grow in you.
[3500.08 → 3500.62] His love
[3500.62 → 3501.36] starts to spread
[3501.36 → 3502.06] through you
[3502.06 → 3504.02] and through you
[3504.02 → 3505.18] into the desert
[3505.18 → 3505.94] of this world.
[3507.34 → 3507.60] Friends,
[3507.70 → 3508.24] that's the final
[3508.24 → 3509.28] invitation of the Bible.
[3510.54 → 3511.36] Jesus invites you
[3511.36 → 3511.98] to come
[3511.98 → 3513.22] and be with him
[3513.22 → 3514.20] even now.
[3515.46 → 3516.18] We long
[3516.18 → 3517.12] for his presence.
[3518.98 → 3519.84] We long
[3519.84 → 3520.46] for it to come
[3520.46 → 3521.04] in his fullness
[3521.04 → 3521.94] and he assures us
[3521.94 → 3522.62] that it will come
[3522.62 → 3523.10] in his fullness
[3523.10 → 3524.16] but we can start
[3524.16 → 3524.98] to experience
[3524.98 → 3526.36] God's presence now.
[3526.94 → 3527.80] We can be with him
[3527.80 → 3528.34] and it's free.
[3528.66 → 3529.56] It's a gift
[3529.56 → 3530.02] of grace.
[3531.02 → 3531.86] And we can be
[3531.86 → 3532.56] renewed now.
[3533.52 → 3534.56] We don't have to wait
[3534.56 → 3535.32] until he comes
[3535.32 → 3536.42] to start being renewed
[3536.42 → 3539.50] by the Spirit's work
[3539.50 → 3539.90] in you,
[3540.06 → 3540.90] bearing fruit
[3540.90 → 3541.74] in your life.
[3541.84 → 3542.56] You can begin
[3542.56 → 3543.24] to be renewed
[3543.24 → 3543.80] right now.
[3544.42 → 3545.88] And you can bear fruit
[3545.88 → 3547.60] for a world
[3547.60 → 3548.62] that is in great need.
[3549.76 → 3550.82] And that's the invitation.
[3551.94 → 3552.28] Let's pray.
[3555.70 → 3556.62] Our Heavenly Father,
[3556.84 → 3558.34] we thank you
[3558.34 → 3558.98] for these words
[3558.98 → 3559.52] of assurance
[3559.52 → 3560.42] that we have
[3560.42 → 3561.84] your word spoken
[3561.84 → 3562.30] to us.
[3562.36 → 3563.10] Our Lord Jesus
[3563.10 → 3565.86] is promised
[3565.86 → 3567.22] and when in our hearts
[3567.22 → 3568.00] and our souls
[3568.00 → 3570.68] we have this cry
[3570.68 → 3571.20] in us
[3571.20 → 3571.72] that says,
[3571.98 → 3573.06] come Lord Jesus.
[3574.22 → 3575.48] There's a response.
[3575.48 → 3577.48] It's a cry
[3577.48 → 3578.30] that is heard.
[3578.48 → 3579.04] It's a cry
[3579.04 → 3579.96] that is attended
[3579.96 → 3581.10] to
[3581.10 → 3582.80] because our Lord
[3582.80 → 3584.70] quickly answers,
[3584.92 → 3585.48] I'm coming.
[3585.94 → 3586.58] I'm coming.
[3588.48 → 3589.26] So Lord,
[3589.34 → 3589.74] we pray,
[3589.90 → 3590.56] would you come?
[3591.48 → 3592.08] Would you come
[3592.08 → 3593.48] to us even today?
[3594.28 → 3595.40] By your Holy Spirit,
[3595.54 → 3596.00] you promise
[3596.00 → 3596.90] to dwell with us,
[3596.94 → 3597.38] your people.
[3597.80 → 3598.34] You promise
[3598.34 → 3599.64] to begin your work
[3599.64 → 3600.22] of renewal
[3600.22 → 3601.04] in us.
[3601.76 → 3602.46] You promise
[3602.46 → 3603.40] that you will be
[3603.40 → 3604.88] with us
[3604.88 → 3606.40] even today
[3606.40 → 3606.76] no matter
[3606.76 → 3607.68] what we go through.
[3608.76 → 3608.98] So Lord,
[3609.02 → 3609.44] we thank you
[3609.44 → 3610.24] for your presence.
[3611.04 → 3611.56] We thank you
[3611.56 → 3612.28] for your renewal
[3612.28 → 3613.26] that we can have
[3613.26 → 3613.80] even now
[3613.80 → 3614.78] as we await
[3614.78 → 3615.20] the fullness
[3615.20 → 3616.04] of those things
[3616.04 → 3616.84] when you return.
[3617.78 → 3619.20] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3619.60 → 3619.86] Amen.
[3623.40 → 3624.14] Please stand.
[3624.14 → 3624.92] Let's sing
[3624.92 → 3625.78] our song
[3625.78 → 3626.74] of response.
[3633.40 → 3645.20] Come broken,
[3646.04 → 3647.36] come captive,
[3647.36 → 3648.74] come,
[3648.88 → 3651.36] all you who mourn,
[3651.36 → 3653.36] all groaning,
[3653.36 → 3657.36] creation rejoice.
[3657.36 → 3662.72] a child,
[3663.06 → 3664.14] a Saviour,
[3664.14 → 3668.82] our healing He brings.
[3669.50 → 3670.60] What freedom,
[3671.70 → 3674.14] what consolation.
[3677.26 → 3679.00] He shall reign.
[3679.00 → 3680.94] He shall reign.
[3680.94 → 3684.54] He shall reign.
[3697.42 → 3699.46] He shall reign.
[3701.46 → 3702.30] He shall reign.
[3702.30 → 3705.44] He shall reign.
[3705.44 → 3710.44] He shall reign
[3710.44 → 3715.98] He'll order His kingdom
[3715.98 → 3720.40] With justice and peace
[3720.40 → 3723.10] O merciful one
[3723.10 → 3727.50] O heaven of God
[3727.50 → 3730.84] All nations
[3730.84 → 3732.24] All people
[3732.24 → 3736.66] All heaven and earth
[3736.66 → 3738.94] We'll bow down
[3738.94 → 3741.68] And to Him proclaim
[3741.68 → 3746.54] He shall reign
[3746.54 → 3748.36] He shall reign
[3748.36 → 3751.70] He shall reign
[3751.70 → 3754.62] He shall reign
[3754.62 → 3756.38] He shall reign
[3756.38 → 3759.70] He shall reign
[3759.70 → 3764.42] He shall reign
[3764.42 → 3767.72] He shall reign
[3768.16 → 3770.30] He shall reign
[3770.30 → 3772.36] He shall reign
[3772.36 → 3775.62] He shall reign
[3775.62 → 3800.18] Before we join in prayer, there is one note I wanted to mention that did not make the bulletin.
[3800.18 → 3806.82] And just informed us before the service that Cor de Bruin is in Peace Arch Hospital with COVID.
[3807.68 → 3809.16] And apparently it's quite serious.
[3809.36 → 3813.64] He's receiving oxygen, but of course he's in intensive care there.
[3813.72 → 3817.76] So we want to keep Cor and his family in prayers.
[3818.84 → 3820.72] Both today and this coming week.
[3822.96 → 3823.74] Let's pray.
[3823.74 → 3823.76] Let's pray.
[3823.76 → 3853.74] Let's pray.
[3853.82 → 3854.76] Let's pray.
[3855.86 → 3858.88] Help us to live.
[3858.88 → 3864.32] And to worship in such a way that we become like magnifying glasses through which our neighbours.
[3864.32 → 3865.42] And co-workers.
[3865.42 → 3871.28] And children and friends can see you come into focus in ways they may not have seen before.
[3871.54 → 3879.48] When people ask for an explanation of the hope we have, give us the words to answer thoughtfully and well.
[3879.48 → 3887.46] When people wonder out loud who Jesus is and why he matters, help us to reply in
[3887.46 → 3893.70] words that will echo the sweetness of your gospel. Help us to magnify your
[3893.70 → 3899.40] name, O Lord, so that you may be glorified in all the earth. And as we look
[3899.40 → 3905.88] ahead in this new year, please bless our congregation. Heal those who are ill,
[3905.88 → 3911.74] comfort those who are grieving, reassure those who feel troubled and frightened
[3911.74 → 3918.72] by what the future may hold. Bless the leadership of our congregation, anoint
[3918.72 → 3925.08] them by your Spirit, and may they really feel that anointing. As they sometimes do
[3925.08 → 3930.54] difficult, sometimes joyful, but always holy work, may they sense your anointing.
[3930.54 → 3936.60] Be in the words they speak, the cards they send, the visits they make. Be in the
[3936.60 → 3941.30] meetings they attend and the committees they work on. Make each of us in this
[3941.30 → 3946.94] congregation a bearer of Pentecost flame, warming hearts, providing hope, lending
[3946.94 → 3952.78] comfort, and so in all these ways contributing to your glory. We pray for
[3952.78 → 3956.94] patience as we face a year starting out with continued uncertainty about the
[3956.94 → 3962.70] pandemic. We pray for an end to the cycle of new variants and wise decisions from
[3962.70 → 3967.70] world leadership as they consider how to get vaccines to countries and peoples that
[3967.70 → 3974.38] can ill afford them. We pray for relief from the cycles of natural disasters we saw
[3974.38 → 3983.16] in 2021. Deadly cold, extreme heat, fires, and torrential rains have affected us all, and we pray for your
[3983.16 → 3990.92] intervention in 2022. We pray for healing for Cory de Bruyne suffering the effects of COVID.
[3990.92 → 3996.20] We just pray that you'll be with all the staff that are trying to help them as best they can.
[3996.20 → 4003.72] We also pray for continued healing for Doug Anderson and all those others dealing with long-term health issues.
[4005.56 → 4011.24] We pray for comfort for Joan Barman, and we pray that you'll be near her and Jerry in the days ahead.
[4011.24 → 4019.56] And we also pray for you to be near all those suffering loss or dealing with fears for the year ahead.
[4020.20 → 4037.00] Please provide comfort and peace. Of course all this we pray ever and only in Jesus name. Amen.
[4037.00 → 4047.96] So please rise and hear these words of blessing upon you.
[4049.32 → 4055.80] And benediction will come right from the very last verse in the Bible.
[4056.68 → 4063.96] Revelation chapter 22 verse 21 is a word of blessing. So I invite you to hold out your hands
[4063.96 → 4074.92] and receive this word of blessing. He who testifies to these things says, yes, I am coming soon. Amen.
[4074.92 → 4081.16] Come Lord Jesus, the grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen.
[4081.16 → 4110.20] Let your light of your face shine on us.
[4110.20 → 4123.06] Lord, let your light, light of your face shine on us
[4123.06 → 4129.78] That we may be saved
[4129.78 → 4136.10] That we may have light
[4136.10 → 4143.16] To find our way in the darkest night
[4143.16 → 4150.10] Let your light shine on us
[4150.10 → 4163.32] Lord, let your grace, grace from your hand fall on us
[4163.32 → 4176.22] Lord, let your grace, grace from your hand fall on us
[4176.22 → 4182.50] That we may be saved
[4182.50 → 4188.86] That we may have light
[4188.86 → 4195.22] To find our way in the darkest night
[4195.22 → 4202.22] Let your grace, grace from your hand fall on us
[4202.22 → 4212.22] Lord, let your love, love with no end come over us
[4212.22 → 4216.64] Lord, let your love, love with no end come over us
[4216.64 → 4228.24] Lord, let your love, love with no end come over us
[4228.24 → 4235.22] That we may be saved
[4235.22 → 4242.28] That we may have life
[4242.28 → 4249.44] To find our way in the darkest night
[4249.44 → 4256.56] Let your love come over us
[4256.56 → 4264.22] Let your light shine on us
[4264.22 → 4294.20] Let your light shine on us
[4294.22 → 4324.20] Let your light shine on us
[4324.20 → 4354.18] Let your light shine on us
