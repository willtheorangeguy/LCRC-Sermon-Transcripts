[739.60 → 757.06] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[757.06 → 763.50] fast on measure, boundless and free,
[763.50 → 777.18] rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me.
[777.88 → 790.50] Underneath me, all around me, is the current of my love,
[790.50 → 797.78] leading onward, leading onward,
[798.24 → 804.18] to thy glorious rest above.
[808.52 → 814.74] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[814.74 → 821.74] spread His praise from shore to shore.
[822.22 → 828.56] How He loves us, ever loves us,
[828.96 → 835.00] changes ever, never more.
[835.00 → 842.12] How He watches for His loved ones,
[842.48 → 849.12] dying to call them on His own.
[849.78 → 856.08] How for them, He's interceding,
[856.08 → 863.14] marching o'er them from the throne.
[865.82 → 873.08] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[874.08 → 880.58] love of every love the best.
[880.58 → 887.44] This an ocean, fast of blessing,
[887.86 → 894.42] this a haven sweet of rest.
[894.96 → 901.58] O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
[901.58 → 908.92] this a haven of heavens to me,
[908.92 → 916.90] and it lifts me up to glory,
[916.90 → 925.78] for it lifts me up to Thee.
[925.78 → 931.52] You may be seated.
[931.52 → 931.62] Thank you.
[941.06 → 944.12] In all the excitement, I forgot to mention that my name is Ernest de Vries.
[944.38 → 946.98] My wife and I and family were members here for 36 years,
[947.10 → 949.80] and I feel right at home again, so my apologies.
[949.80 → 955.54] And it really feels like home again.
[955.86 → 957.62] I just really, really appreciate it,
[957.70 → 959.90] and to see this beautiful congregation now.
[961.16 → 962.06] Praising God.
[963.26 → 965.20] For the confession and assurance of pardon,
[965.32 → 967.70] I like to read one scripture verse,
[967.80 → 970.92] because I think this puts it all together,
[971.02 → 972.18] the confession and assurance,
[972.30 → 973.74] and it's from Titus chapter 2.
[975.14 → 976.62] And this is what it says.
[977.26 → 978.78] The Apostle Paul writes to Titus,
[978.78 → 1001.76] And then verse 3.
[1001.76 → 1004.20] At one time we too were foolish,
[1004.58 → 1006.72] disobedient, deceived,
[1006.98 → 1010.00] and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.
[1011.00 → 1013.04] We lived in malice and envy,
[1013.66 → 1016.02] being hated and hating one another.
[1017.02 → 1019.34] But when the kindness and love of God,
[1019.42 → 1020.46] our Saviour, appeared,
[1021.06 → 1021.90] He saved us,
[1022.38 → 1025.24] not because of righteous things we had done,
[1025.74 → 1027.76] but because of His mercy.
[1027.76 → 1033.42] He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
[1034.14 → 1038.58] whom we poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ,
[1039.18 → 1039.92] our Saviour,
[1040.46 → 1041.14] so that,
[1042.78 → 1044.66] having been justified by His grace,
[1045.16 → 1046.72] we might become heirs,
[1047.22 → 1050.02] having the hope of eternal life.
[1050.02 → 1052.42] And then Paul finishes with this,
[1052.42 → 1055.24] this is a trustworthy saying.
[1056.04 → 1058.20] And let us sing our response in Christ alone.
[1058.20 → 1071.58] In Christ alone,
[1071.58 → 1074.28] my hope is found,
[1074.28 → 1075.78] He is my light,
[1075.88 → 1077.28] my strength,
[1077.38 → 1078.62] my song,
[1079.08 → 1080.90] His cornerstone,
[1081.42 → 1083.40] His solid ground,
[1083.94 → 1085.40] firm through the fiercest
[1085.40 → 1087.90] strand and stone,
[1088.30 → 1090.62] what heights of love,
[1090.72 → 1092.62] what depths of peace,
[1092.92 → 1095.20] when fears are still,
[1095.32 → 1097.28] my striving cease,
[1097.66 → 1099.70] my comforter,
[1099.70 → 1101.70] my all in all,
[1102.82 → 1104.70] here in the love of Christ,
[1105.62 → 1106.70] I stand.
[1106.70 → 1118.20] In Christ alone,
[1118.20 → 1120.90] who took on flesh,
[1120.90 → 1125.30] fullness of God in helpless bay,
[1125.60 → 1129.18] His gift of love and righteousness,
[1130.62 → 1134.66] scorned by the ones He came to save,
[1134.66 → 1137.48] till on the cross,
[1137.48 → 1139.38] as Jesus died,
[1139.84 → 1143.62] the wrath of God was satisfied,
[1144.56 → 1149.52] for every sin on Him was laid,
[1149.52 → 1154.64] here in the death of Christ I live.
[1154.64 → 1166.46] There in the ground,
[1166.46 → 1169.32] His body lay,
[1169.46 → 1173.82] light of the world by darkness slain,
[1174.16 → 1178.78] and bursting forth in glorious day,
[1179.16 → 1183.08] up from the grave He rose again,
[1183.08 → 1187.30] and as He stands in victory,
[1188.14 → 1192.46] sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
[1192.46 → 1195.10] for I am His,
[1195.34 → 1197.76] and He is mine,
[1198.26 → 1203.56] bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[1203.56 → 1214.60] No guilt in life,
[1214.60 → 1216.88] no fear in death,
[1216.88 → 1221.30] this is the power of Christ in me,
[1221.44 → 1226.44] from life's right to final breath,
[1226.44 → 1230.06] Jesus commands my destiny,
[1230.06 → 1233.60] no power of hell,
[1233.66 → 1235.56] no human plan,
[1235.92 → 1240.60] can ever block me from His hand,
[1240.76 → 1243.18] till He returns,
[1243.50 → 1245.88] or calls me home,
[1246.40 → 1249.46] here in the power of Christ,
[1249.46 → 1257.10] Zoom callers and
[1257.10 → 1257.92] in the end,
[1257.96 → 1262.58] you come now,
[1262.58 → 1264.78] and you come now,
[1264.78 → 1271.24] you come now,
[1271.24 → 1283.96] we come now to the celebration of the lord's supper at this table
[1283.96 → 1291.38] before we come to this table we confess our faith together this friends what we're about
[1291.38 → 1298.18] to confess is the true story about who we are before the lord if we put our trust in him
[1298.18 → 1304.62] from the Heidelberg catechism question and answer one let's say it together brothers and sisters
[1304.62 → 1314.86] what is your only comfort in life and in death that I am not my own but belong body and soul
[1314.86 → 1324.82] in life and in death to my faithful saviour Jesus Christ he has fully paid for all my sins
[1324.82 → 1334.76] with his precious blood and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil he also watches over me
[1334.76 → 1342.94] in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my father in heaven
[1342.94 → 1355.02] in fact all things must work together for my salvation because I belong to him Christ by his
[1355.02 → 1365.14] Holy Spirit assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live
[1365.14 → 1365.88] for him
[1365.88 → 1378.04] Moses was pressing god for a symbol of his presence to be with him and to go with him
[1378.04 → 1385.66] and friends that is what this table is the lord Jesus Christ gave us this bread and this cup to say
[1385.66 → 1393.84] every time you eat this is a symbol it is a sign that I am with you that I am going with you
[1393.84 → 1401.24] that my glory abides with you and because it's a sign it's only meant for those who have given
[1401.24 → 1408.72] themselves to the lord this table is for those who by faith have repented and put their trust in the
[1408.72 → 1415.48] lord Jesus and who have expressed that trust and faith through the sacrament of baptism this table is
[1415.48 → 1421.16] for those who belong to Jesus and if that is, you then friends this table is meant to nourish you
[1421.16 → 1429.26] it's meant to nourish you in the grace of following the lord Jesus because in these elements he does
[1429.26 → 1431.40] abide with us, he is spiritually present
[1431.40 → 1442.22] the lord knows that you fall short of his glory, and yet he comes to you, and he invites you to this table
[1442.22 → 1449.18] the apostle Paul gave these words of institution
[1449.18 → 1461.38] they are there okay the lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given
[1461.38 → 1468.68] thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me

[2096.92 → 2097.48] There's your leaf.
[2098.00 → 2098.62] All right.
[2099.62 → 2101.72] All right, everyone, come have a seat.
[2105.68 → 2107.62] Hi, Alex.
[2108.68 → 2112.38] Hello, Alex.
[2112.38 → 2120.16] That sounds great.
[2120.70 → 2120.98] Okay.
[2121.38 → 2122.06] Everyone's here.
[2123.80 → 2125.34] You guys want to come over or are you okay?
[2126.34 → 2126.78] Hi.
[2131.18 → 2131.70] Okay.
[2132.38 → 2133.12] All right, guys.
[2133.22 → 2135.66] Now, how many eyes do you have?
[2136.66 → 2137.10] Okay.
[2137.44 → 2139.32] How many eyes do we want to have when we're done?
[2140.76 → 2141.12] Two.
[2142.96 → 2143.36] Okay.
[2144.26 → 2147.02] So, let's keep our leaves down.
[2147.16 → 2148.58] I'll tell you when to wave them.
[2148.94 → 2149.18] Okay.
[2149.88 → 2151.18] I want to tell you a story.
[2151.96 → 2152.36] Okay.
[2152.44 → 2153.96] So, the story is about Jesus.
[2160.96 → 2161.54] He's fine.
[2161.98 → 2162.24] Okay.
[2163.04 → 2163.44] Okay.
[2163.52 → 2164.56] Listen to this story.
[2164.64 → 2165.10] Ready, guys?
[2165.66 → 2167.48] Do you know what today is called?
[2169.94 → 2170.88] It is Sunday.
[2171.14 → 2174.88] It's a special Sunday called Palm Sunday, right?
[2174.98 → 2175.80] So, you have palm branches.
[2175.94 → 2176.58] It's Palm Sunday.
[2176.96 → 2179.02] Now, what happened with these palm branches?
[2179.94 → 2180.54] I'm going to tell you.
[2180.58 → 2188.28] What happened is Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem.
[2189.78 → 2191.16] Have you ever ridden a donkey?
[2192.56 → 2192.96] No.
[2193.12 → 2193.54] No.
[2193.54 → 2193.86] No.
[2193.86 → 2194.34] No.
[2194.46 → 2198.14] But Jesus rode a donkey, and all the people, they said, Hosanna.
[2198.74 → 2201.02] And they waved their palm branches to Jesus.
[2201.16 → 2201.84] Can you guys try that?
[2202.22 → 2202.46] Ready?
[2202.98 → 2203.42] Hosanna.
[2205.06 → 2205.50] Hosanna.
[2205.74 → 2205.86] Right?
[2205.92 → 2206.40] And you wave it.
[2207.24 → 2207.54] Yeah.
[2207.78 → 2208.12] Okay.
[2209.28 → 2211.58] Now, I'm going to tell you something really.
[2211.76 → 2213.44] I'm going to read a passage from the Bible.
[2214.28 → 2214.70] Okay.
[2214.70 → 2215.12] All right.
[2219.60 → 2220.12] All right.
[2220.18 → 2220.84] Everyone, look here.
[2221.06 → 2221.58] Look here.
[2221.96 → 2222.38] Look here.
[2222.84 → 2223.20] Watch.
[2223.88 → 2224.24] Shh.
[2224.34 → 2224.58] Ready?
[2226.34 → 2226.78] Stop.
[2227.98 → 2228.38] Okay.
[2228.92 → 2229.38] All right.
[2229.42 → 2230.28] You just hold it, okay?
[2230.44 → 2231.00] Just hold it.
[2232.52 → 2232.92] Ready?
[2233.02 → 2234.04] I'm going to read from the Bible.
[2234.04 → 2243.10] Well, as Jesus approached Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent out two
[2243.10 → 2244.02] of his disciples.
[2245.02 → 2247.82] And he said, go to the village ahead of you.
[2247.82 → 2255.86] And as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.
[2256.70 → 2258.80] Untie it and bring it here.
[2259.46 → 2262.06] If anyone asks you, why are you untying it?
[2262.16 → 2264.38] Tell him, the Lord needs it.
[2265.26 → 2266.00] Did you guys listen?
[2266.36 → 2267.00] Did you guys hear?
[2267.14 → 2270.24] What did Jesus' disciples go to get for Jesus?
[2270.86 → 2271.72] I don't know.
[2272.00 → 2272.36] Listen.
[2272.84 → 2273.54] I know.
[2273.64 → 2274.06] You couldn't hear.
[2274.38 → 2274.60] Listen.
[2274.70 → 2274.84] Ready?
[2275.30 → 2275.90] A colt.
[2275.90 → 2277.92] Who knows what a colt is?
[2280.38 → 2280.90] Yeah.
[2281.04 → 2282.06] A colt is a donkey.
[2282.74 → 2283.30] But you know what?
[2283.38 → 2285.36] A colt is a baby donkey.
[2285.74 → 2289.40] And it says, no one has ever ridden it before.
[2290.14 → 2291.46] So let me ask you a question.
[2292.50 → 2300.06] Do you think if there was a baby donkey that has never been ridden ever before by a human
[2300.06 → 2304.76] being, how would they feel about Jesus trying to ride him?
[2305.90 → 2308.98] What happens when you try to ride a horse?
[2308.98 → 2310.64] It's never been ridden before.
[2312.44 → 2313.30] It's hard.
[2313.46 → 2314.90] It jumps around.
[2315.04 → 2315.52] It bucks.
[2315.64 → 2316.80] It doesn't want you to ride it.
[2317.12 → 2318.82] Animals are afraid of people.
[2319.24 → 2319.90] Did you know that?
[2320.26 → 2323.00] Animals are afraid of people.
[2323.00 → 2334.10] But what we learn about Jesus is that he does something that no one can do.
[2334.48 → 2335.18] It's impossible.
[2335.80 → 2338.14] You can't ride a baby colt who's never been ridden.
[2339.14 → 2341.42] But Jesus does this impossible thing.
[2341.48 → 2342.08] And you know why?
[2342.70 → 2346.18] Because he, like walking on water, exactly.
[2346.50 → 2348.28] Because he is the humble king.
[2348.28 → 2352.58] Jesus is so gentle that the animals know it.
[2352.98 → 2353.94] They trust him.
[2354.60 → 2360.50] That donkey trusted Jesus even though he's never been ridden before.
[2361.38 → 2363.16] And here's what I want you to remember.
[2364.16 → 2371.26] That if that donkey can trust Jesus because he's so gentle, then we can trust Jesus too.
[2371.26 → 2371.74] Okay?
[2373.92 → 2379.32] Jesus can come into our lives, and we can trust him because he is gentle.
[2380.68 → 2381.12] Okay?
[2381.72 → 2382.80] That's what I want you to remember.
[2383.24 → 2383.64] Yes?
[2387.64 → 2388.86] What else can Jesus do?
[2391.12 → 2392.60] He can raise people from the dead.
[2392.78 → 2393.10] That's right.
[2393.62 → 2394.94] And that's what we'll talk about next week.
[2395.78 → 2396.04] Okay.
[2396.28 → 2397.20] So, thanks.
[2397.20 → 2399.54] And go ahead.
[2399.66 → 2401.88] If you're really young, you can go to your class.
[2401.96 → 2403.24] Otherwise, you can go back to your seats.
[2403.24 → 2403.88] Yeah.
[2404.12 → 2404.44] Yeah.
[2404.94 → 2405.98] Let's do it now.
[2407.14 → 2408.68] Let's do it now.
[2409.04 → 2409.24] Okay.
[2427.20 → 2457.18] Let's do it now.
[2457.18 → 2458.18] Let's do it now.
[2458.18 → 2459.18] Let's do it now.
[2459.18 → 2460.18] Let's do it now.
[2460.18 → 2461.18] Let's do it now.
[2461.18 → 2462.18] Let's do it now.
[2462.18 → 2464.18] Let's do it now.
[2464.18 → 2466.18] Let's do it now.
[2466.18 → 2468.18] Let's do it now.
[2468.18 → 2472.22] A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it.
[2472.68 → 2477.84] Put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
[2478.50 → 2482.10] When he had received the drink, Jesus said, It is finished.
[2482.90 → 2486.00] With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
[2486.50 → 2487.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[2487.98 → 2489.78] Thanks be to God.
[2498.18 → 2505.34] Let's pray together.
[2508.10 → 2512.20] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have again fed us at your table,
[2512.36 → 2513.92] and now, Lord, you feed us with your word.
[2515.50 → 2520.10] Lord, would you make our hearts, our ears, our minds attentive
[2520.10 → 2524.64] to what you would have to say from your word this morning to us, Lord.
[2524.92 → 2527.14] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2528.18 → 2534.36] So we have been in a series looking at the seven last words that Jesus spoke
[2534.36 → 2536.30] as he was hanging on the cross.
[2536.68 → 2539.68] Because as was mentioned, this is the season of Lent,
[2539.98 → 2544.94] the season when we consider the suffering and the death of Jesus Christ
[2544.94 → 2548.42] for us because of his great love for us.
[2549.84 → 2553.34] Now, I think in terms of Jesus' final words from the cross,
[2553.34 → 2556.18] that this is one of the most familiar.
[2556.18 → 2558.26] Jesus says,
[2558.86 → 2560.78] It is finished.
[2561.48 → 2562.48] It is finished.
[2563.44 → 2565.70] And we might read this story in the Bible,
[2566.06 → 2567.20] and we might just say,
[2567.36 → 2570.08] Okay, Jesus died.
[2570.74 → 2571.84] It's over with.
[2572.12 → 2572.82] It's finished.
[2573.64 → 2575.10] And then we might just read that.
[2575.22 → 2575.62] Jesus says,
[2575.68 → 2576.16] It is finished.
[2576.22 → 2577.30] And just pass on.
[2577.30 → 2581.32] But to do that would be to miss a gem
[2581.32 → 2585.22] that John has put right in front of us here.
[2586.02 → 2587.68] In the Gospel of John,
[2588.22 → 2590.82] the words and the language and the imagery
[2590.82 → 2593.20] in the final chapters of the Gospel,
[2593.56 → 2598.08] they're all summing up the ideas and motifs
[2598.08 → 2602.10] that as a reader, we've already read in the book.
[2602.10 → 2605.80] So when John tells us here in verse 28,
[2606.48 → 2611.36] Jesus knew that everything had now been finished.
[2611.88 → 2613.40] And then Jesus says,
[2613.74 → 2615.54] It is finished.
[2616.10 → 2617.88] He repeats the word twice.
[2618.66 → 2619.84] And do you know what he's doing?
[2621.12 → 2622.84] He's winking at us.
[2623.56 → 2626.12] He's hinting at something.
[2626.26 → 2626.72] And he's saying,
[2626.84 → 2627.86] Do you remember this?
[2628.26 → 2628.96] It's finished.
[2628.96 → 2629.88] It's finished.
[2630.78 → 2632.70] You've read it a couple of times already
[2632.70 → 2634.14] in the Gospel of John
[2634.14 → 2637.70] about Jesus needing to finish a work.
[2638.74 → 2641.56] So often, we read over it.
[2642.18 → 2644.10] But there is a story here
[2644.10 → 2647.14] that John wants us to explore.
[2648.94 → 2651.10] So what is Jesus getting at here?
[2652.16 → 2654.50] Well, it has profound implications
[2654.50 → 2656.04] for how we think about
[2656.04 → 2657.62] how to be a follower of Christ
[2657.62 → 2660.32] and how to live in the light,
[2660.44 → 2663.02] in light of the finished work of Jesus Christ.
[2663.76 → 2666.78] So I want us to consider this last word of Jesus.
[2666.94 → 2667.80] It is finished.
[2668.52 → 2671.12] From the perspective of an experience
[2671.12 → 2672.64] that I think a lot of us
[2672.64 → 2674.16] have probably had before.
[2674.30 → 2675.60] Now I'm going to give you an example
[2675.60 → 2678.00] of the kind of experience I'm talking about.
[2678.00 → 2684.76] It involves the word rip rap.
[2685.32 → 2687.34] I don't know if any of you know what rip rap is.
[2687.96 → 2690.10] Something I have become all too familiar with.
[2690.64 → 2691.38] Well, there it is.
[2692.54 → 2693.58] It's the rocks.
[2694.20 → 2698.96] So my wife, her parents,
[2699.08 → 2700.60] so my mother and father-in-law,
[2701.04 → 2703.14] they live, well, they have a cabin
[2703.14 → 2705.72] on a lake in Virginia called Smith Mountain Lake.
[2705.72 → 2707.98] And so what happened was
[2707.98 → 2710.34] there was going to be a by law put into place
[2710.34 → 2713.18] where you weren't allowed to touch the bank.
[2713.26 → 2714.84] It's like an environmental protection thing.
[2715.34 → 2717.58] But before the by law went into effect,
[2717.68 → 2720.94] my father-in-law wanted to line the bank with rocks
[2720.94 → 2722.24] called rip rap.
[2722.58 → 2723.50] And this is so, you know,
[2723.54 → 2726.18] it protects the bank from eroding into the lake.
[2726.72 → 2728.30] And so I go to visit.
[2728.46 → 2729.44] You know, we're living in Taiwan.
[2729.60 → 2730.48] We go home, we visit.
[2730.48 → 2732.38] And he puts me right to work.
[2733.54 → 2735.84] So we drive his pickup truck
[2735.84 → 2737.76] down into a neighbouring field.
[2738.60 → 2739.38] You know, and I mean,
[2739.46 → 2741.20] the truck was like going steep down.
[2741.30 → 2742.40] I really thought we were going to roll over.
[2742.66 → 2743.26] But we didn't.
[2743.36 → 2744.04] He knew what he was doing.
[2744.44 → 2746.14] We drove the thing down into a field.
[2746.20 → 2746.76] And what do we do?
[2747.20 → 2748.24] We dug for rocks.
[2748.94 → 2751.74] It's not quite as fun as hunting for Easter eggs.
[2752.16 → 2754.54] But we would dig out these big rocks.
[2754.62 → 2755.64] Some of them are quite huge.
[2755.72 → 2757.86] We'd load them into his pickup truck.
[2757.86 → 2759.54] We'd drive it back to the lake,
[2759.64 → 2760.86] down to the lakeside,
[2760.98 → 2765.78] and unload the rocks and pile them along the shore.
[2767.56 → 2770.56] Now, it felt like it took us forever.
[2770.72 → 2771.08] I don't know.
[2771.26 → 2772.50] I can't remember how long.
[2772.60 → 2774.50] We were at this, I think, for about two weeks.
[2774.74 → 2775.98] I don't think we did it every day.
[2776.68 → 2779.40] But, you know, we spent the good many days
[2779.40 → 2782.02] of my vacation hauling rocks.
[2782.60 → 2784.84] At the time, I think I was a seminary student.
[2784.96 → 2786.44] So actually, it was a good change of pace
[2786.44 → 2788.72] from sitting at a desk to being active.
[2789.20 → 2790.40] So I didn't mind it too much.
[2791.24 → 2794.14] But then finally, we're lining the shoreline.
[2794.26 → 2795.54] We're moving from one end to the other.
[2795.62 → 2796.92] And finally, we get to the end.
[2797.12 → 2798.88] And my father-in-law, Jimmy, says,
[2798.96 → 2800.36] I think we have enough rocks.
[2800.62 → 2801.68] And we were finished.
[2803.04 → 2803.26] Ah.
[2805.54 → 2807.80] Have you ever had an experience like that before?
[2808.44 → 2810.48] Finishing a big project of some kind
[2810.48 → 2813.24] than just having a deep sense of relief.
[2813.50 → 2814.02] It's over.
[2815.46 → 2818.18] Maybe you've had something hanging over your head
[2818.18 → 2820.54] for months, maybe years.
[2821.24 → 2822.98] You have dreams about it.
[2823.30 → 2824.18] Bad dreams.
[2825.04 → 2828.50] You dream of the things that you still need to accomplish
[2828.50 → 2830.66] to complete the chore.
[2830.78 → 2832.24] I was working on that shoreline.
[2832.50 → 2834.44] I dreamed of hauling rocks.
[2834.44 → 2837.58] But then you finally finish it.
[2838.62 → 2842.02] And there's this just deep sense of a work is done.
[2842.14 → 2842.84] It's completed.
[2843.40 → 2844.76] It's such a huge relief.
[2844.86 → 2846.02] You know if you're a student,
[2846.64 → 2849.16] it comes after that big test is over.
[2849.86 → 2851.82] If you have a debt and a loan,
[2851.94 → 2854.08] maybe it comes when you finally paid it off.
[2854.52 → 2857.24] Or maybe you're working on a new house or a renovation.
[2857.62 → 2859.38] And it all comes together.
[2859.38 → 2862.20] And you can think about different kinds of scenarios
[2862.20 → 2864.36] when you've had an experience like this.
[2865.82 → 2867.64] And you might think of it again.
[2868.62 → 2870.68] But that would be a waste of energy.
[2870.68 → 2871.90] Because it's finished.
[2872.48 → 2875.74] You don't have to think about it anymore.
[2876.96 → 2879.12] And if you, right now,
[2879.20 → 2881.98] can kind of lock into an experience like this
[2881.98 → 2882.84] that you have had,
[2883.30 → 2886.00] you will be able to read this passage
[2886.00 → 2887.80] with a fresh set of eyes.
[2887.80 → 2889.88] Jesus said,
[2891.12 → 2892.70] it is finished.
[2893.68 → 2897.02] So here's the word that John uses.
[2897.30 → 2898.22] And that Jesus uses.
[2898.30 → 2899.22] And we'll see it up here.
[2899.62 → 2902.26] It's a Greek word that's pronounced telex.
[2903.14 → 2904.10] Everyone say it with me.
[2904.26 → 2904.78] Telex.
[2905.54 → 2906.10] Telex.
[2906.54 → 2908.28] It's translated here as,
[2908.50 → 2909.36] it is finished.
[2909.88 → 2911.86] But in Greek, it has a different nuance
[2911.86 → 2915.20] than our English word, finish,
[2915.20 → 2918.70] that it may or may not have in the word finish.
[2918.70 → 2921.80] It has to do, in Greek, with purpose.
[2922.56 → 2923.26] With a goal.
[2924.76 → 2927.70] You know, we dug up and hauled those rocks
[2927.70 → 2930.78] and poured them on the shore for a purpose.
[2931.18 → 2933.22] Not just to have a good time.
[2933.94 → 2937.46] But to protect the shoreline from eroding into the lake.
[2937.46 → 2941.38] And when we cover the whole length of the shoreline,
[2941.50 → 2942.54] it's finished.
[2942.60 → 2946.06] Because the goal has come to an end.
[2946.12 → 2948.70] It's about completion of an intent.
[2950.08 → 2953.46] Now Jesus knows that everything that was supposed to happen,
[2954.42 → 2954.88] happened.
[2955.78 → 2956.92] It's telex.
[2957.20 → 2957.94] It's finished.
[2958.06 → 2958.92] It's done.
[2959.06 → 2960.18] It has been accomplished.
[2960.34 → 2961.82] It's reached its purpose.
[2961.82 → 2964.70] So now the question is,
[2964.82 → 2965.56] well, what is it?
[2966.26 → 2969.02] What is it that Jesus knows and declares
[2969.02 → 2971.52] has come to its completion?
[2973.18 → 2976.34] What purpose has Jesus accomplished
[2976.34 → 2978.94] with his death on the cross?
[2980.04 → 2982.46] Of course, his life is going to be finished,
[2982.98 → 2983.86] though not for long.
[2984.80 → 2986.84] But what else is being finished?
[2987.56 → 2988.88] And to answer that question,
[2988.88 → 2993.56] we need to do a little tour of the theme of finished
[2993.56 → 2995.02] in the Gospel of John.
[2996.08 → 2998.18] So are you ready to join me
[2998.18 → 3001.46] as we follow some breadcrumbs through the Gospel of John?
[3002.90 → 3003.72] Just say yes.
[3003.76 → 3004.88] I mean, we're going to be anyway, but just...
[3005.88 → 3006.88] I mean...
[3007.56 → 3008.30] Okay.
[3008.66 → 3010.98] First, in chapter 4,
[3011.54 → 3013.04] Jesus is talking with a woman.
[3013.84 → 3015.70] Which in that culture of the day
[3015.70 → 3017.02] is a big no-no.
[3017.54 → 3018.18] A taboo.
[3018.18 → 3020.98] A man talking to a woman he's not married to,
[3021.32 → 3022.80] who he's not related to,
[3023.12 → 3024.72] you don't do that kind of thing.
[3025.00 → 3027.70] You might bring yourself and the woman into disrepute.
[3028.76 → 3030.06] But not only that,
[3030.48 → 3031.60] she's not even Jewish.
[3032.38 → 3033.60] She's a Samaritan,
[3033.88 → 3035.18] which is somewhat similar,
[3035.90 → 3037.36] but they were very many outcasts
[3038.28 → 3040.64] and ostracized by the Jewish people.
[3041.90 → 3044.98] And Jesus has a whole conversation with this woman.
[3044.98 → 3047.58] He knows her heart
[3047.58 → 3050.46] and he speaks right into her life.
[3051.52 → 3054.30] And she comes to believe in him as the Messiah.
[3054.80 → 3055.64] It's amazing.
[3056.74 → 3058.28] And then in verse 31,
[3059.04 → 3063.12] Jesus' disciples return from going on a trip to go get some food.
[3063.12 → 3065.36] And they come back, and they say,
[3065.98 → 3066.30] Rabbi,
[3066.74 → 3067.70] eat something.
[3069.00 → 3069.26] You know,
[3069.30 → 3070.16] you've been talking to people,
[3070.34 → 3070.62] I'll stay,
[3070.74 → 3071.50] why don't you have something to eat.
[3071.86 → 3072.84] But he said to them,
[3073.10 → 3075.64] I have food to eat that you know nothing about.
[3076.46 → 3078.26] Then his disciples said to each other,
[3078.66 → 3080.04] did we miss something?
[3080.54 → 3081.02] Like what?
[3081.64 → 3083.52] Could someone have brought him food?
[3083.52 → 3084.12] My food,
[3084.12 → 3086.20] my food,
[3086.34 → 3087.10] Jesus said,
[3087.74 → 3090.54] is to do the will of him who sent me
[3090.54 → 3092.44] and to what?
[3093.68 → 3095.38] Finish his work.
[3095.54 → 3096.10] To lay.
[3100.12 → 3101.28] In other words,
[3101.36 → 3102.04] Jesus is saying,
[3102.16 → 3103.00] my food,
[3103.74 → 3103.96] right,
[3104.02 → 3105.32] what motivates me
[3105.32 → 3106.90] and energizes me
[3106.90 → 3107.92] and drives me
[3107.92 → 3108.98] is not bread,
[3109.62 → 3111.56] it's to follow the will of my father.
[3111.56 → 3113.06] I am going,
[3113.46 → 3114.18] I am here,
[3114.30 → 3114.98] I have come
[3114.98 → 3116.52] to bring to completion
[3116.52 → 3118.30] the work that he has given me to do.
[3119.54 → 3120.80] And then Jesus continues
[3120.80 → 3121.98] in verse 35
[3121.98 → 3122.62] and he says,
[3123.42 → 3124.48] don't you have a saying,
[3124.60 → 3126.08] it's still four months until the harvest?
[3126.86 → 3127.82] I tell you,
[3128.18 → 3129.52] open your eyes
[3129.52 → 3131.00] and look at the fields,
[3131.30 → 3132.32] they are ripe
[3132.32 → 3133.64] for harvest.
[3134.52 → 3136.36] And this is a very Jewish image.
[3136.56 → 3137.80] It's drawn from the prophets
[3137.80 → 3139.78] that at the end of the age
[3139.78 → 3141.48] that there would be a great harvest
[3141.48 → 3143.24] of God's people.
[3143.48 → 3144.14] All of those
[3144.14 → 3145.64] who have repentant hearts,
[3146.04 → 3148.22] who recognize God's rescue of them,
[3148.52 → 3150.28] will be gathered in
[3150.28 → 3151.88] to the kingdom of God.
[3153.10 → 3154.14] And so Jesus says,
[3154.26 → 3155.32] this Samaritan woman,
[3156.32 → 3158.10] this outcast to you guys,
[3158.56 → 3161.08] has just been brought in
[3161.08 → 3162.30] to the harvest.
[3162.78 → 3164.10] That's what I'm here to do.
[3164.70 → 3166.70] That is what I have come to accomplish.
[3167.42 → 3168.26] And so he says to them,
[3168.52 → 3169.42] open your eyes,
[3169.42 → 3171.00] we are in a Samaritan village.
[3171.66 → 3173.68] There's lots more Samaritans around.
[3173.82 → 3175.26] This is part of the mission
[3175.26 → 3177.72] to gather even them
[3177.72 → 3180.42] into the harvest of God's kingdom.
[3183.42 → 3185.88] So one thing that Jesus is doing on the cross
[3185.88 → 3187.74] is he's finishing this work
[3187.74 → 3189.00] of gathering people
[3189.00 → 3190.10] into the kingdom of God.
[3190.74 → 3192.86] That's part of what he's finishing here.
[3193.56 → 3195.78] He's here to finish that work.
[3195.78 → 3199.70] So let's follow the breadcrumb trail
[3199.70 → 3200.72] one step further.
[3201.24 → 3202.24] In chapter five,
[3203.10 → 3203.90] Jesus heals.
[3204.50 → 3205.74] He heals a man
[3205.74 → 3206.92] who cannot walk.
[3207.64 → 3208.64] He's in Jerusalem
[3208.64 → 3209.76] and it's the Sabbath.
[3210.54 → 3211.84] It's the day of rest.
[3212.34 → 3213.86] Now you're not supposed to work.
[3213.98 → 3215.46] That's the whole point.
[3216.30 → 3218.16] It's a way of symbolically demonstrating
[3218.16 → 3219.94] that my worth as a human being
[3219.94 → 3220.98] made in God's image
[3220.98 → 3224.72] is not reliant on my ability to produce
[3224.72 → 3227.74] but to rest in the energy
[3227.74 → 3229.30] and the grace that God gives.
[3230.46 → 3232.32] So what happened was
[3232.32 → 3234.16] a bunch of religious traditions
[3234.16 → 3235.88] in Jewish culture
[3235.88 → 3237.48] had grown up around the Sabbath.
[3238.94 → 3241.24] And so Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath
[3241.24 → 3243.44] and it sparks controversy.
[3243.44 → 3247.68] Is Jesus working on the Sabbath?
[3247.80 → 3248.56] That's the question.
[3249.50 → 3250.72] Now look what Jesus says here
[3250.72 → 3253.80] beginning in verse 16 of chapter 5.
[3255.30 → 3257.58] So because Jesus was doing these things
[3257.58 → 3258.24] on the Sabbath,
[3258.46 → 3260.50] the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.
[3261.06 → 3261.86] In his defence,
[3262.02 → 3262.82] Jesus said to them,
[3263.40 → 3266.48] my father is always at his work
[3266.48 → 3267.96] to this very day
[3267.96 → 3272.54] and I too am working.
[3273.44 → 3275.22] For this reason,
[3276.42 → 3278.00] they tried all the more to kill him.
[3278.10 → 3279.76] Not only was he breaking the Sabbath
[3279.76 → 3282.50] but he was even calling God his own father
[3282.50 → 3285.48] making himself equal with God.
[3287.04 → 3290.14] So Jesus is saying that God is opposed
[3290.14 → 3294.50] to these man-made human religious traditions
[3294.50 → 3297.54] that have become more oppressive
[3297.54 → 3300.98] than actually giving life
[3300.98 → 3303.58] and being filled with grace.
[3305.08 → 3306.56] And who does Jesus say
[3306.56 → 3307.42] is working on the Sabbath?
[3308.30 → 3308.94] He says,
[3309.32 → 3310.30] I'm working on the Sabbath.
[3310.66 → 3311.74] I just healed this guy.
[3311.90 → 3312.34] You bet.
[3312.54 → 3313.54] I am working on the Sabbath.
[3314.48 → 3315.18] And you know who else
[3315.18 → 3315.98] is working on the Sabbath?
[3317.34 → 3317.82] God.
[3318.96 → 3319.22] Right?
[3319.54 → 3320.36] Jesus is saying,
[3320.68 → 3321.66] God's here working
[3321.66 → 3323.80] in and through me.
[3323.80 → 3326.62] And then look at verse 36.
[3328.46 → 3330.02] For the works
[3330.02 → 3332.08] that the Father has given me to do,
[3332.54 → 3333.08] what?
[3334.66 → 3335.14] Finish.
[3335.70 → 3336.92] He has given me to finish.
[3337.30 → 3338.72] The very works that I am doing
[3338.72 → 3341.02] testify that the Father has sent me.
[3342.10 → 3343.38] So despite the fact
[3343.38 → 3344.46] that Jesus is breaking
[3344.46 → 3345.56] their religious customs,
[3345.68 → 3346.42] not the law of God
[3346.42 → 3347.10] but their customs,
[3347.48 → 3348.82] he's finishing the work
[3348.82 → 3350.48] that the Father has sent him to do.
[3350.48 → 3352.80] Now what work has Jesus done
[3352.80 → 3354.12] in the context of the story?
[3355.52 → 3356.86] Well, he's healed a man.
[3357.68 → 3357.88] Right?
[3357.98 → 3358.68] He's healed a man.
[3359.12 → 3360.20] The man was crippled.
[3360.42 → 3361.34] He couldn't walk.
[3362.14 → 3363.22] And not only that,
[3363.30 → 3364.36] as a crippled man,
[3364.46 → 3365.50] he was an outsider.
[3365.88 → 3367.44] He was not allowed
[3367.44 → 3368.82] into the temple area
[3368.82 → 3370.16] to worship God.
[3371.12 → 3374.22] So Jesus is physically healing this man,
[3374.42 → 3376.16] but he's also restoring him
[3376.16 → 3377.28] to community,
[3377.72 → 3378.48] into the community
[3378.48 → 3380.28] the community of his followers.
[3380.88 → 3381.98] So he's healing.
[3382.90 → 3384.68] He's bringing shalom.
[3385.80 → 3387.70] Restoration in body and soul.
[3388.66 → 3390.46] This is part of the work
[3390.46 → 3393.10] that Jesus comes to finish.
[3393.74 → 3395.00] He says it right here.
[3395.54 → 3396.60] I've come to do this.
[3396.80 → 3397.94] I've come to bring healing.
[3398.82 → 3400.22] I've come to bring shalom.
[3401.18 → 3402.86] So Jesus comes to include
[3402.86 → 3405.16] all of these in the harvest
[3405.16 → 3406.92] who might not otherwise be included.
[3406.92 → 3409.00] And he comes to bring healing.
[3409.46 → 3410.78] And this is all part of the work
[3410.78 → 3412.14] that needs to be finished
[3412.14 → 3414.04] that he is here for.
[3415.20 → 3418.44] The last stop on our trail of breadcrumbs
[3418.44 → 3419.50] is in chapter 17.
[3420.28 → 3422.40] Now this is Jesus' final hour
[3422.40 → 3424.46] with his closest disciples.
[3424.64 → 3425.56] They had just finished
[3425.56 → 3427.04] this Passover meal.
[3428.62 → 3429.96] It's the last night
[3429.96 → 3431.40] before he's arrested
[3431.40 → 3433.12] and nailed to the cross.
[3433.12 → 3435.28] And here in chapter 17
[3435.28 → 3437.00] we find this beautiful prayer
[3437.00 → 3438.42] that Jesus prays
[3438.42 → 3440.16] on behalf of his followers.
[3441.10 → 3442.14] So we're just going to read
[3442.14 → 3442.96] this first paragraph
[3442.96 → 3445.42] of the prayer that Jesus says.
[3446.04 → 3447.28] John chapter 17.
[3448.08 → 3449.72] After Jesus said this
[3449.72 → 3451.14] he looked toward heaven
[3451.14 → 3451.58] and prayed
[3451.58 → 3452.96] Father
[3452.96 → 3455.08] the hour has come.
[3456.02 → 3457.28] Glorify your son
[3457.28 → 3458.50] that your son
[3458.50 → 3459.66] may glorify you.
[3459.66 → 3461.50] For you granted him authority
[3461.50 → 3462.56] over all people
[3462.56 → 3463.74] that he might give
[3463.74 → 3464.62] eternal life
[3464.62 → 3465.72] to all those
[3465.72 → 3468.88] you have given him.
[3470.14 → 3470.70] Now
[3470.70 → 3471.94] this is
[3471.94 → 3473.30] eternal life.
[3473.84 → 3474.98] That they know you
[3474.98 → 3476.34] the only true God
[3476.34 → 3477.36] in Jesus Christ
[3477.36 → 3478.34] whom you have sent.
[3478.68 → 3479.98] I have brought you glory
[3479.98 → 3480.68] on earth
[3480.68 → 3481.42] by
[3481.42 → 3482.66] finishing
[3483.28 → 3485.06] the work you gave me to do.
[3485.06 → 3488.00] Now
[3488.00 → 3489.00] there is like
[3489.00 → 3490.46] 20
[3490.46 → 3491.22] different
[3491.22 → 3492.10] awesome things
[3492.10 → 3493.44] going on in this passage.
[3493.80 → 3495.42] But let's just point out one.
[3496.36 → 3497.06] He says
[3497.06 → 3497.70] I'm now
[3497.70 → 3499.04] finishing this work.
[3499.60 → 3500.68] This mission
[3500.68 → 3501.88] that God
[3501.88 → 3502.82] has given me
[3502.82 → 3503.92] that you have given me
[3503.92 → 3504.74] I
[3504.74 → 3505.60] am I finishing.
[3506.26 → 3507.70] And what does he say
[3507.70 → 3508.66] is the work
[3508.66 → 3509.86] that he is finishing here?
[3510.98 → 3511.88] He is giving
[3511.88 → 3513.14] eternal life
[3513.14 → 3513.86] to those
[3513.86 → 3514.88] who turn to him.
[3515.06 → 3516.92] Now
[3516.92 → 3517.36] it's interesting
[3517.36 → 3518.16] how does Jesus
[3518.16 → 3518.96] define
[3518.96 → 3520.16] eternal life?
[3520.64 → 3521.46] Right here
[3521.46 → 3522.02] Jesus says
[3522.02 → 3522.70] eternal life
[3522.70 → 3523.16] is to
[3523.16 → 3524.04] know
[3524.04 → 3525.44] the only true God
[3525.44 → 3526.82] in Jesus Christ
[3526.82 → 3527.64] whom you have sent.
[3528.54 → 3528.68] Right?
[3528.90 → 3529.62] So Jesus came
[3529.62 → 3530.32] to include
[3530.32 → 3530.96] in the harvest
[3530.96 → 3531.60] all those
[3531.60 → 3532.22] who would enter
[3532.22 → 3533.02] into the kingdom
[3533.02 → 3534.46] with repentant hearts.
[3534.76 → 3535.58] He came to bring
[3535.58 → 3536.16] healing
[3536.16 → 3537.12] and restoration
[3537.12 → 3538.42] and he came
[3538.42 → 3539.02] to give
[3539.02 → 3540.06] eternal life
[3540.06 → 3541.24] life now
[3541.24 → 3542.64] and life
[3542.64 → 3543.76] to come
[3543.76 → 3545.34] in God's
[3545.34 → 3546.24] eternal kingdom
[3546.24 → 3546.80] that will come
[3546.80 → 3547.78] when Jesus returns
[3547.78 → 3548.98] and renews
[3548.98 → 3550.02] all things.
[3551.02 → 3551.70] And this life
[3551.70 → 3552.60] what is this life
[3552.60 → 3553.34] that Jesus comes
[3553.34 → 3553.78] to give?
[3554.00 → 3554.94] Is to know
[3554.94 → 3556.56] God
[3556.56 → 3557.62] and be known
[3557.62 → 3558.80] by him.
[3559.94 → 3560.92] That's the heart
[3560.92 → 3561.70] of being a Christian.
[3562.36 → 3563.52] It's not to do
[3563.52 → 3564.32] religious duties
[3564.32 → 3565.86] it's to be
[3565.86 → 3566.30] invited
[3566.30 → 3567.80] into a relationship
[3567.80 → 3568.96] with the one
[3568.96 → 3569.86] who has made you.
[3570.48 → 3571.04] To know
[3571.04 → 3571.90] the one true God
[3571.90 → 3572.94] and to be fully
[3572.94 → 3574.44] known by your creator.
[3574.64 → 3575.34] That is life.
[3575.80 → 3576.24] And that's what
[3576.24 → 3577.38] Jesus came to accomplish.
[3578.64 → 3579.46] And so we follow
[3579.46 → 3580.42] the breadcrumbs
[3580.42 → 3581.38] to chapter 19
[3581.38 → 3582.62] and Jesus is now
[3582.62 → 3583.68] hanging on a cross.
[3584.34 → 3585.08] And somehow
[3585.08 → 3586.06] Jesus knows
[3586.06 → 3586.88] that in this
[3586.88 → 3587.72] very moment
[3587.72 → 3589.10] his work
[3589.10 → 3590.16] is being brought
[3590.16 → 3590.90] to completion.
[3591.60 → 3592.48] He's dying
[3592.48 → 3593.24] to remove
[3593.24 → 3594.12] that great barrier
[3594.12 → 3596.02] between broken people
[3596.02 → 3597.90] and their creator God
[3597.90 → 3599.16] so that they
[3599.16 → 3600.00] so that we can
[3600.00 → 3601.32] experience eternal life.
[3601.44 → 3602.70] So that we can be healed.
[3602.94 → 3603.98] So that we can be
[3603.98 → 3605.26] included in the harvest.
[3606.76 → 3607.96] And as we
[3607.96 → 3609.76] hear Jesus say
[3609.76 → 3610.90] it is finished.
[3611.30 → 3612.46] All of that
[3612.46 → 3614.04] should be ringing
[3614.04 → 3615.06] in our ears.
[3618.14 → 3619.22] Now lastly
[3619.22 → 3620.50] what does it mean
[3620.50 → 3621.18] for us
[3621.18 → 3622.92] what is it
[3622.92 → 3623.98] what is the work
[3623.98 → 3625.14] of the cross
[3625.14 → 3627.18] where Jesus says
[3627.18 → 3627.96] it is finished
[3627.96 → 3628.66] what does it mean
[3628.66 → 3629.40] for us personally?
[3630.18 → 3630.98] How do we live
[3630.98 → 3631.58] in light
[3631.58 → 3633.16] of the finished work
[3633.16 → 3634.84] of Jesus on the cross?
[3637.28 → 3638.58] Well how many of us
[3638.58 → 3639.76] actually live
[3639.76 → 3641.06] every part
[3641.06 → 3641.86] of our lives
[3641.86 → 3643.88] our relationships
[3643.88 → 3645.92] our work
[3645.92 → 3647.16] our rest
[3647.16 → 3649.10] from a place
[3649.10 → 3649.96] of deep
[3649.96 → 3651.26] rest
[3651.26 → 3653.12] where we know
[3653.12 → 3654.84] deep in our bones
[3654.84 → 3656.12] in our souls
[3656.12 → 3657.04] that Jesus
[3657.04 → 3657.80] has finished
[3657.80 → 3658.72] everything for us.
[3660.02 → 3660.26] You know
[3660.26 → 3661.04] even though Jesus
[3661.04 → 3662.10] says it here
[3662.10 → 3662.68] he says
[3662.68 → 3663.62] it is finished
[3663.62 → 3665.52] I live
[3665.52 → 3667.64] in so many ways
[3667.64 → 3668.44] that proclaim
[3668.44 → 3669.38] that his work
[3669.38 → 3670.32] is not finished.
[3671.24 → 3672.06] And I think
[3672.06 → 3673.02] we all do this.
[3673.48 → 3673.98] Right?
[3674.06 → 3674.74] We live as if
[3674.74 → 3675.62] the work is not finished
[3675.62 → 3676.42] because many of us
[3676.42 → 3677.02] we have this
[3677.02 → 3678.16] compulsive desire
[3678.16 → 3679.34] to finish
[3679.34 → 3680.02] what Jesus
[3680.02 → 3680.62] was doing
[3680.62 → 3681.26] on the cross
[3681.26 → 3681.86] for us.
[3682.66 → 3683.06] You know
[3683.06 → 3683.42] we're trying
[3683.42 → 3683.78] to finish
[3683.78 → 3684.38] it ourselves.
[3685.58 → 3686.32] We have been
[3686.32 → 3686.74] given this
[3686.74 → 3688.00] beautiful lakeside
[3688.00 → 3689.04] complete
[3689.04 → 3690.44] with rocks
[3690.44 → 3691.56] the best
[3691.56 → 3692.12] of rip rap.
[3692.46 → 3693.20] It's all there
[3693.20 → 3693.96] the rocks
[3693.96 → 3694.58] are in place
[3694.58 → 3695.54] and we feel
[3695.54 → 3695.86] the need
[3695.86 → 3696.34] to go into
[3696.34 → 3696.72] fields
[3696.72 → 3697.42] digging up
[3697.42 → 3697.96] more rocks
[3697.96 → 3698.74] hauling them
[3698.74 → 3699.38] to the lakeside
[3699.38 → 3700.18] and putting
[3700.18 → 3700.56] them there
[3700.56 → 3701.04] ourselves
[3701.04 → 3702.40] instead of
[3702.40 → 3702.74] just
[3702.74 → 3704.12] going for
[3704.12 → 3704.50] a swim
[3704.50 → 3706.74] relaxing
[3706.74 → 3707.68] it's done
[3707.68 → 3708.44] it's finished
[3708.44 → 3710.40] and this
[3710.40 → 3710.90] happens in
[3710.90 → 3711.28] all kinds
[3711.28 → 3711.54] of different
[3711.54 → 3711.88] ways
[3711.88 → 3713.58] but one
[3713.58 → 3714.00] way is
[3714.00 → 3714.92] we continue
[3714.92 → 3715.46] to carry
[3715.46 → 3716.10] this burden
[3716.10 → 3716.76] of guilt
[3716.76 → 3717.54] and shame
[3717.54 → 3718.86] because of
[3718.86 → 3719.38] the ways
[3719.38 → 3719.78] that maybe
[3719.78 → 3720.08] we have
[3720.08 → 3720.58] hurt other
[3720.58 → 3721.00] people
[3721.00 → 3721.88] or the way
[3721.88 → 3722.18] we have
[3722.18 → 3722.80] hurt ourselves
[3722.80 → 3724.46] and we
[3724.46 → 3725.08] continue to
[3725.08 → 3725.66] live under
[3725.66 → 3726.50] this shadow
[3726.50 → 3728.34] and carry
[3728.34 → 3728.98] that burden
[3728.98 → 3729.68] around with
[3729.68 → 3730.06] us
[3730.06 → 3731.42] I do
[3731.42 → 3731.78] that
[3731.78 → 3732.76] we all
[3732.76 → 3732.92] do
[3732.92 → 3733.16] that
[3733.16 → 3735.04] but friends
[3735.04 → 3735.88] I don't
[3735.88 → 3736.46] have deep
[3736.46 → 3736.80] enough
[3736.80 → 3737.38] pockets
[3737.38 → 3738.44] to pay
[3738.44 → 3739.52] off the
[3739.52 → 3739.82] debt
[3739.82 → 3740.24] that I
[3740.24 → 3740.48] have
[3740.48 → 3740.72] towards
[3740.72 → 3741.02] God
[3741.02 → 3742.58] neither
[3742.58 → 3743.22] do you
[3743.22 → 3745.20] and what
[3745.20 → 3745.74] Jesus is
[3745.74 → 3746.56] pronouncing
[3746.56 → 3746.94] here
[3746.94 → 3747.94] the finished
[3747.94 → 3748.26] work of
[3748.26 → 3748.68] the cross
[3748.68 → 3749.20] is a word
[3749.20 → 3749.72] of grace
[3749.72 → 3750.44] to people
[3750.44 → 3751.44] who live
[3751.44 → 3751.84] under the
[3751.84 → 3752.26] cloud of
[3752.26 → 3752.66] their own
[3752.66 → 3752.88] guilt
[3752.88 → 3753.14] and their
[3753.14 → 3753.62] own shame
[3753.62 → 3754.40] it's a
[3754.40 → 3754.66] word of
[3754.66 → 3755.00] grace
[3755.00 → 3756.64] he's saying
[3756.64 → 3757.46] you cannot
[3757.46 → 3758.24] finish what
[3758.24 → 3758.80] Jesus finished
[3758.80 → 3759.18] for you
[3759.18 → 3760.02] that's why
[3760.02 → 3760.48] he had to
[3760.48 → 3760.68] do it
[3760.68 → 3760.94] that's the
[3760.94 → 3761.34] whole point
[3761.34 → 3761.96] it's impossible
[3761.96 → 3763.40] he finished
[3763.40 → 3763.98] it for you
[3763.98 → 3766.16] the word
[3766.16 → 3766.74] of the cross
[3766.74 → 3767.36] it is
[3767.36 → 3767.84] finished
[3767.84 → 3768.94] is putting
[3768.94 → 3769.88] its arm
[3769.88 → 3771.06] around you
[3771.06 → 3772.52] it's telling
[3772.52 → 3772.94] you that
[3772.94 → 3773.58] Jesus has
[3773.58 → 3774.16] died for
[3774.16 → 3774.36] you
[3774.36 → 3774.92] that he
[3774.92 → 3775.62] has gathered
[3775.62 → 3776.06] you into
[3776.06 → 3776.58] his kingdom
[3776.58 → 3777.36] that he
[3777.36 → 3778.16] has healed
[3778.16 → 3779.24] your soul
[3779.24 → 3780.26] and restored
[3780.26 → 3780.68] you to
[3780.68 → 3781.20] worship of
[3781.20 → 3781.54] God
[3781.54 → 3782.20] that you
[3782.20 → 3783.08] are known
[3783.08 → 3785.26] and loved
[3785.26 → 3786.58] you are
[3786.58 → 3787.12] known
[3787.12 → 3787.98] deeply
[3787.98 → 3789.48] all the
[3789.48 → 3789.94] way through
[3789.94 → 3790.26] you are
[3790.26 → 3790.58] known
[3790.58 → 3792.16] all the
[3792.16 → 3792.50] stuff you
[3792.50 → 3793.32] are guilty
[3793.32 → 3793.84] and ashamed
[3793.84 → 3794.10] of
[3794.10 → 3794.96] he knows
[3794.96 → 3796.54] and he
[3796.54 → 3796.98] loves you
[3796.98 → 3798.56] it's done
[3798.56 → 3800.76] here's the
[3800.76 → 3801.24] question for
[3801.24 → 3801.42] us
[3801.42 → 3802.00] can you
[3802.00 → 3802.62] believe that
[3802.62 → 3804.10] are you
[3804.10 → 3804.68] willing
[3804.68 → 3806.36] to receive
[3806.36 → 3807.08] that
[3807.08 → 3808.24] and rest
[3808.24 → 3808.66] in it
[3808.66 → 3810.56] it's grace
[3810.56 → 3811.64] it's what he
[3811.64 → 3811.94] has done
[3811.94 → 3812.22] for you
[3812.22 → 3812.62] it is
[3812.62 → 3813.02] finished
[3813.02 → 3813.64] you are
[3813.64 → 3814.32] an object
[3814.32 → 3814.84] of God's
[3814.84 → 3815.12] love
[3815.12 → 3816.88] he sees
[3816.88 → 3817.06] you
[3817.06 → 3817.62] he knows
[3817.62 → 3817.88] you
[3817.88 → 3818.62] he loves
[3818.62 → 3818.88] you
[3818.88 → 3820.32] let the
[3820.32 → 3820.80] finished
[3820.80 → 3821.24] work of
[3821.24 → 3821.70] the cross
[3821.70 → 3822.54] speak that
[3822.54 → 3822.90] word of
[3822.90 → 3823.20] grace
[3823.20 → 3824.10] to you
[3824.10 → 3824.60] this morning
[3824.60 → 3826.34] let me
[3826.34 → 3826.66] pray for
[3826.66 → 3827.34] us
[3827.34 → 3832.68] father
[3832.68 → 3833.32] help us
[3833.32 → 3834.02] to believe
[3834.02 → 3836.10] we claim
[3836.10 → 3836.70] to believe
[3836.70 → 3838.40] so often
[3838.40 → 3838.74] we don't
[3838.74 → 3839.14] live it
[3839.14 → 3840.58] it is

[4248.62 → 4251.32] So we are all in contact, and we love it.
[4251.48 → 4252.90] And so we have become Officers.
[4252.90 → 4258.02] It's good to be here.
[4258.16 → 4259.14] Wonderful time of worship.
[4259.42 → 4259.90] Let us pray.
[4259.90 → 4260.90] Thank you.
[4260.90 → 4261.90] Thank you.
[4261.90 → 4264.40] Father in heaven, triune God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
[4264.40 → 4269.08] We began this morning with Psalm 100, with a psalm of thanks.
[4269.58 → 4281.42] And what a wonderful hour of worship it has been to give you thanks for singing and the children and the message and also the Lord's Supper.
[4281.42 → 4294.72] Lord, what a picture that one day from every tribe and every nation, we will eat the bread and drink the wine and celebrate the supper of the Lamb in the presence of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour.
[4294.72 → 4300.48] Lord, we thank you again for everything already this morning.
[4300.56 → 4304.30] We also thank you, Lord, for the week that has passed us.
[4304.30 → 4313.28] And even though we began with thanks, that within that context of Thanksgiving to you, we also know that there is sadness.
[4313.72 → 4316.90] We experienced that on Friday and yesterday.
[4317.40 → 4328.16] And we will experience that again this coming Tuesday with the final words of comfort when Joan Barman is being laid to rest.
[4328.16 → 4342.52] And Lord God, we sorrow, but we have that glorious hope of that resurrection, which we will again celebrate this coming Friday, your death, and then the resurrection on Easter Sunday.
[4344.02 → 4352.62] Lord, we thank you for a week of work you gave us and of food and fellowship.
[4353.92 → 4355.72] Lord, you have been very good to us.
[4355.72 → 4365.36] Lord, at the same time, as we talk to farmers in this area, we pray, Lord, that you will give sunshine so that they can work the fields again.
[4365.48 → 4369.36] We are so dependent upon your grace, also in terms of the weather.
[4371.32 → 4373.76] And Lord, we pray for the church family here.
[4373.94 → 4375.12] And there's a long list.
[4376.50 → 4379.70] And Lord God, these names are all mentioned on that list.
[4379.70 → 4395.56] And so we ask that as members we may pray for all of us here who are suffering, who are lonely, who are maybe depressed, who have all kinds of problems, physical problems they have to deal with.
[4395.72 → 4398.22] Lord God, may we bring it all to you.
[4399.40 → 4404.16] Lord, we pray for your church, not only here, but also the rest of this nation.
[4404.16 → 4407.34] Lord God, we pray for your church worldwide.
[4409.00 → 4413.08] Especially where there is persecution.
[4415.72 → 4419.00] Where the church is in Ukraine and in Russia.
[4420.80 → 4423.96] And Lord God, you have taught us to pray for our enemies.
[4423.96 → 4428.86] And so Lord, we pray for the church in Ukraine.
[4431.08 → 4432.86] That they have to pray for their enemies.
[4434.48 → 4435.58] But also in Russia.
[4437.04 → 4438.78] And also in other parts of the world.
[4441.38 → 4442.92] Lord, have mercy upon us.
[4444.60 → 4450.18] As we somehow also, because of technology, see everything that happens in this world.
[4450.18 → 4456.22] Lord God, we begin again this morning with the fact that you are the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[4456.62 → 4457.56] Will you bring peace?
[4459.80 → 4464.44] Heavenly Father, we pray that you will go with us then.
[4465.36 → 4468.06] Again, you gave us a wonderful time of worship.
[4469.00 → 4471.08] And what a blessing it is to be here today.
[4471.66 → 4474.58] To see so many people from different nations.
[4475.32 → 4478.68] What a beautiful picture of the future that is awaiting us.
[4478.68 → 4480.56] Hear our prayer, Lord.
[4480.64 → 4482.28] Give us a good day and give us a good week.
[4482.58 → 4484.02] Together with family and friends.
[4484.68 → 4486.08] And protect us when we work.
[4486.64 → 4487.38] And when we travel.
[4488.30 → 4490.48] We ask this all in the blessed name of Jesus Christ.
[4491.42 → 4494.18] The one we will celebrate is coming Friday again.
[4494.78 → 4495.94] And coming Sunday.
[4496.82 → 4498.32] Praise and glory to your name.
