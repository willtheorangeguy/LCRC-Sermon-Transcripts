[262.66 --> 278.66]  Good morning, everyone.
[278.66 --> 280.66]  Good morning.
[280.66 --> 286.66]  So wherever you are, whether you've come this morning or whether you are online live stream,
[286.66 --> 291.66]  and why ever you have come, we're glad you're here.
[291.66 --> 292.66]  I'm Jason Truel.
[292.66 --> 295.66]  I'm the lead pastor here at Ladner CRC.
[295.66 --> 300.66]  And I'm grateful that you're here, especially if you haven't been here in a long time, or
[300.66 --> 302.66]  if you are joining us for the first time.
[302.66 --> 308.66]  We're just grateful that we can be together to worship the Lord this morning.
[308.66 --> 316.66]  And especially as we are now entering into this important season of Lent together.
[316.66 --> 317.66]  Right?
[317.66 --> 325.66]  This is that season where we focus on anticipating the death of Jesus Christ, and then after that,
[325.66 --> 327.66]  his resurrection.
[327.66 --> 336.66]  And we're also inviting God to renew his work of death and resurrection in us.
[336.66 --> 337.66]  Right?
[337.66 --> 343.66]  That God would reveal what he wants to be changed and transformed in our own lives and in our church.
[343.66 --> 350.66]  And I really hope that you will use this season to invite God to do that work in us.
[350.66 --> 356.66]  And so today is Family Worship Sunday, so we welcome our Chinese brothers and sisters with us this morning.
[356.66 --> 360.66]  We also welcome the children to worship with us as well.
[360.66 --> 370.66]  So we're going to prepare our hearts for worship this morning by hearing God's call to worship from Psalm 115.
[370.66 --> 377.66]  So I invite you to join me in reading where it has the two arrows.
[377.66 --> 378.66]  reading chapter 17, verse 1, verse 1.
[378.66 --> 388.66]  Blessed be God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who bears our burdens and forgives our sins.
[388.66 --> 398.66]  Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.
[398.66 --> 401.90]  Why do the nations say, where is their God?
[402.80 --> 404.52]  Our God is in heaven.
[405.22 --> 407.78]  He does whatever he pleases him.
[409.46 --> 412.66]  You who fear him, trust in the Lord.
[413.20 --> 415.70]  He is our help and shield.
[416.82 --> 421.86]  He will bless those who fear the Lord, small and great alike.
[422.60 --> 427.32]  We who bless the Lord, both now and forevermore.
[427.32 --> 428.92]  Please pray with me.
[430.58 --> 435.54]  O God, we worship you this morning because there is no one like you.
[436.60 --> 445.58]  We turn from every idol and worship you alone because nothing created is as good and perfect as you are.
[446.38 --> 450.84]  To your name be the glory because of your love and faithfulness.
[450.84 --> 458.38]  And we worship your only son, our Lord Jesus Christ, because he is the way, the truth, and the life.
[459.16 --> 461.20]  He is the way through the wilderness.
[462.48 --> 468.74]  He is the way to what we were created for, which is to know you and to be known by you.
[468.74 --> 474.86]  And we worship the Holy Spirit because he pours your very love into our hearts.
[475.72 --> 478.36]  The Spirit is present and active among us.
[478.96 --> 484.28]  The Spirit guides us through our wilderness and abides with us each step of the way.
[484.28 --> 495.26]  And so we ask that you would hear the words of our mouths and that you would take joy in our love for you and of our praise of you.
[495.74 --> 498.42]  We pray all of this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[499.06 --> 499.46]  Amen.
[499.46 --> 504.76]  So would you please rise in body or in spirit for God's greeting.
[504.92 --> 507.38]  God greets us with these words from the letter of Jude.
[508.28 --> 508.58]  He says,
[508.72 --> 514.12]  To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,
[514.88 --> 519.68]  mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[519.68 --> 529.46]  So as a family united under Jesus Christ, our Savior, we have peace with God and we have peace with one another.
[530.10 --> 533.58]  So let's turn now and greet one another.
[549.68 --> 561.30]  Loan and falsely with ye apostles.
[561.46 --> 565.40]  Baby, the Son of man 38, mercy, peace, and even the Son of man 38, mercy, peace, and eventh late in spirit.

[1010.06 --> 1012.06]  Amen.
[1024.82 --> 1037.32]  We continue to worship the Lord this morning in a time of confession where we come before the Lord with the honesty of our own hearts, our own sin, our brokenness that we struggle with.
[1037.32 --> 1045.78]  And we look to the Lord Jesus Christ for his extravagant grace that he pours out upon us.
[1047.20 --> 1050.16]  So let's say this confession together.
[1050.30 --> 1050.82]  I'll begin.
[1051.92 --> 1060.08]  We praise you, holy God, for your steadfast love given to us in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1060.08 --> 1069.52]  Hold us by your grace, even as we have sinned against it and marred our relationship with you and our neighbor.
[1070.44 --> 1075.16]  We repent of our sins and long for you to restore us.
[1075.16 --> 1090.64]  In your great love, come, cleanse, heal, and help us, that we may live out our days to the praise of your grace and to the glory of your holy name.
[1091.20 --> 1091.80]  Amen.
[1091.80 --> 1105.92]  Hear us now, Father, as we come before you in the private quietness of our hearts, looking to Christ, who bore our sin and our shame in our place.
[1105.92 --> 1121.46]  Brothers and sisters, our heavenly Father is merciful.
[1122.42 --> 1127.72]  And much to our relief and delight, his mercy is freely given.
[1128.68 --> 1132.02]  But though it is free, it came at a great cost.
[1132.02 --> 1140.44]  We have the hope of holiness because through Jesus' death, God forgives us our sins.
[1141.90 --> 1146.38]  So let us hear these words of assurance of pardon from Psalm 103.
[1146.94 --> 1153.72]  For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1153.72 --> 1162.70]  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1163.82 --> 1171.32]  As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1172.18 --> 1173.48]  Thanks be to God.
[1174.26 --> 1179.18]  As those who have been forgiven and set free by the saving work of Christ on the cross,
[1179.18 --> 1183.58]  let's stand and let's sing together of his grace.
[1183.58 --> 1204.46]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1204.46 --> 1215.46]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1215.46 --> 1245.44]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1245.44 --> 1247.44]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1247.44 --> 1249.44]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1249.44 --> 1250.44]  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me.
[1250.44 --> 1255.44]  Make us one in heart and mind.
[1255.44 --> 1260.44]  Make us one in love.
[1260.44 --> 1271.44]  Humble, caring, selfless, sharing.
[1271.44 --> 1283.44]  Spirit of the living God, fill our lives with love.
[1283.44 --> 1309.64]  We are invited to the table today, friends.
[1309.64 --> 1316.64]  And this table is for all who claim the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.
[1316.64 --> 1321.64]  All those who have been baptized into his family are welcome.
[1321.64 --> 1322.64]  Am I on?
[1322.64 --> 1324.64]  Yes, you are.
[1324.64 --> 1325.64]  Yeah, okay.
[1325.64 --> 1326.64]  It's hard to tell.
[1326.64 --> 1336.64]  You know, this table reminds us that at the center of our life together is a crucified Savior.
[1336.64 --> 1349.64]  And as we come to the table today, you're invited to believe that in the death and resurrection of this crucified man, that your salvation is found.
[1349.64 --> 1356.64]  You're being invited to claim his death for the sake of our sin.
[1356.64 --> 1365.64]  You're being invited to die to yourself, to die to your sin, to no longer live for yourself and your own kingdom.
[1365.64 --> 1370.64]  And that itself is a kind of death.
[1370.64 --> 1378.64]  So would you please join me in prayer as we prepare our hearts to come and celebrate at the table.
[1378.64 --> 1387.64]  Lord Jesus Christ, this is indeed a hard call, the call to follow you and to carry our own cross.
[1387.64 --> 1390.64]  To renounce our sin and our selfishness.
[1390.64 --> 1396.64]  To turn away from a life that is centered upon ourselves and upon our own kingdoms.
[1396.64 --> 1400.64]  To turn instead to you and take up our cross and follow you.
[1400.64 --> 1403.64]  It is a hard call.
[1403.64 --> 1406.64]  And yet, Lord, it is an easy call.
[1406.64 --> 1413.64]  Because what we get in following you is life and everlasting hope.
[1413.64 --> 1416.64]  The fellowship of the triune God.
[1416.64 --> 1423.64]  Father, we thank you that what we get is far more precious than anything that we could lose.
[1423.64 --> 1430.64]  Would you give us faith today to see all that we gain in Christ through his cross.
[1430.64 --> 1436.64]  And that we would come to this table ready to receive the gift of our crucified Lord.
[1436.64 --> 1439.64]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1439.64 --> 1449.64]  Would you stand with me and let us confess our hope, our faith in Christ in the reading of the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1449.64 --> 1452.64]  Question and answer one.
[1452.64 --> 1456.64]  What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[1456.64 --> 1458.64]  Let's say it together.
[1458.64 --> 1468.64]  That I am not my own, but belong, body and soul, in life and in death, to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[1468.64 --> 1474.64]  He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood.
[1474.64 --> 1479.64]  And has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.
[1479.64 --> 1490.64]  He also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven.
[1490.64 --> 1496.64]  In fact, all things must work together for my salvation.
[1496.64 --> 1512.64]  Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him.
[1512.64 --> 1515.64]  You may be seated.
[1515.64 --> 1533.64]  Today, as we hear the words of institution, we're going to look not today to 1 Corinthians, but instead to the Last Supper in Matthew 26.
[1533.64 --> 1536.64]  So let me read this for us.
[1536.64 --> 1540.64]  While they were eating, Jesus took bread.
[1540.64 --> 1547.64]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said to his disciples, saying,
[1547.64 --> 1548.64]  Take and eat.
[1548.64 --> 1550.64]  This is my body.
[1550.64 --> 1559.64]  Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink from it, all of you.
[1559.64 --> 1569.64]  This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[1569.64 --> 1580.64]  I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of this cup, fruit of the vine, from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.
[1580.64 --> 1585.64]  And friends, as we come to the Lord's table, would you turn your eyes again to the screen?
[1585.64 --> 1588.64]  And we're going to approach the Lord's table today.
[1588.64 --> 1591.64]  Be ready to receive this meal with these words.
[1591.64 --> 1594.64]  Brothers and sisters, lift up your hearts.
[1594.64 --> 1597.64]  We lift them up to the Lord.
[1597.64 --> 1599.64]  We are his people.
[1599.64 --> 1601.64]  We are redeemed.
[1601.64 --> 1603.64]  Go ahead.
[1603.64 --> 1604.64]  We are redeemed.
[1604.64 --> 1605.64]  Is it there?
[1605.64 --> 1607.64]  Oh, okay.
[1607.64 --> 1608.64]  That's okay.
[1608.64 --> 1611.64]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1611.64 --> 1612.64]  Hallelujah.
[1612.64 --> 1613.64]  Hallelujah.
[1613.64 --> 1618.64]  Friends, these are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[1618.64 --> 1619.64]  Hallelujah.
[1619.64 --> 1625.64]  So this last time, this Sunday, we are going to continue to come forward to receive the elements.
[1625.64 --> 1633.64]  We're going to consider maybe next month, seeing how things go, to maybe go back to our traditional way of taking the elements seated.
[1633.64 --> 1635.64]  But today, again, we will come forward.
[1635.64 --> 1641.64]  We will have ushers who will invite you to come forward row by row, beginning in the back.
[1641.64 --> 1643.64]  And so you'll come forward.
[1643.64 --> 1649.64]  In families, or one by one, they just take the bread, and you can eat it, take the cup and drink it.
[1649.64 --> 1652.64]  And then go back along the sides to your table.
[1652.64 --> 1656.64]  If you would prefer to remain seated, we also have some ushers.
[1656.64 --> 1661.64]  You know, you can just indicate to them, and they can come and serve you in your seats as well.
[1661.64 --> 1662.64]  Okay.
[1662.64 --> 1671.64]  So would the servers, the elders, now please come forward, and we will prepare to take the elements together.
[1671.64 --> 1675.64]  What, what, what do others do floods people fall?

[2237.94 --> 2242.94]  We thank you that we can taste your love and smell it and feel it.

[2262.94 --> 2265.94]  And I want to share something with you.
[2267.94 --> 2272.94]  Don't be afraid.
[2273.94 --> 2274.94]  Some of you.
[2274.94 --> 2278.94]  We do Shrimp Phoenix Town Res bet she lives.
[2279.94 --> 2281.94]  Come on up here?
[2282.94 --> 2284.94]  That was very similar.
[2284.94 --> 2285.94]  You know.
[2285.94 --> 2286.94]  Have a seat.
[2286.94 --> 2298.02]  Come on up.
[2298.90 --> 2299.50]  You want to sit here?
[2300.84 --> 2301.20]  Okay.
[2301.58 --> 2301.96]  Right here.
[2303.72 --> 2303.92]  Oh.
[2304.76 --> 2305.68]  You got it.
[2307.24 --> 2307.94]  Good job.
[2308.74 --> 2309.38]  That's a good climb.
[2309.82 --> 2310.60]  Yep, you can sit here.
[2312.34 --> 2313.02]  All right.
[2314.40 --> 2315.34]  So, good morning.
[2315.34 --> 2317.18]  How are you all today?
[2319.90 --> 2320.76]  Okay, ready?
[2320.86 --> 2321.32]  We're going to listen.
[2321.70 --> 2321.88]  Okay.
[2322.40 --> 2329.90]  I want to share something that Jesus said.
[2331.00 --> 2332.24]  Jesus said this.
[2333.74 --> 2340.84]  In this world you will have trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world.
[2341.70 --> 2342.68]  Jesus said those things.
[2343.04 --> 2343.72]  What did he say?
[2343.72 --> 2345.90]  He said, in this world you will have what?
[2347.44 --> 2347.88]  Trouble.
[2348.84 --> 2352.62]  Do you guys know of any trouble that's happening in the world right now?
[2354.50 --> 2355.88]  Maybe you guys are too young.
[2355.96 --> 2356.68]  I should have thought of this.
[2356.68 --> 2364.64]  So, right now in the world there's a bad thing that's happening and it's called a war.
[2364.94 --> 2368.36]  It's when one country fights against another country.
[2368.66 --> 2370.48]  Have you heard about this?
[2371.28 --> 2372.52]  Some of you may have.
[2372.74 --> 2373.58]  Not you, I guess.
[2373.58 --> 2383.58]  Yeah, well, the Bible tells us and history shows us that, you know, people turned away from God.
[2384.22 --> 2387.22]  God made people, but people turned away.
[2387.86 --> 2393.22]  And when that happened, it made people want to fight with each other.
[2393.64 --> 2395.46]  That's what happens because of sin.
[2395.56 --> 2396.76]  People want to fight with each other.
[2396.76 --> 2401.50]  And so, Jesus tells us that wars will happen.
[2402.74 --> 2405.46]  Now, when bad things happen in the world, how does that make us feel?
[2408.12 --> 2409.22]  Sad, right?
[2410.56 --> 2412.58]  Who else feels sad when bad things happen?
[2412.76 --> 2413.16]  Mommy.
[2413.74 --> 2414.04]  No?
[2414.30 --> 2414.60]  Okay.
[2414.78 --> 2416.88]  Does anybody else feel sad when bad things happen?
[2416.88 --> 2417.80]  I do.
[2418.76 --> 2420.16]  Because I can...
[2420.16 --> 2421.60]  I can...
[2421.60 --> 2422.02]  You're...
[2422.02 --> 2422.64]  I can...
[2422.64 --> 2423.46]  I can...
[2423.46 --> 2423.50]  I can...
[2423.50 --> 2423.52]  I can...
[2423.52 --> 2423.54]  I can...
[2423.54 --> 2423.92]  I can...
[2423.92 --> 2424.42]  I can...
[2424.42 --> 2424.44]  I can...
[2424.44 --> 2425.42]  I can...
[2425.42 --> 2425.92]  I can...
[2425.92 --> 2426.26]  I can...
[2426.26 --> 2426.56]  Okay.
[2427.56 --> 2428.04]  Yeah.
[2428.40 --> 2428.76]  Right.
[2430.76 --> 2431.84]  That's another discussion.
[2433.64 --> 2436.00]  But first, Jesus says that when we...
[2436.00 --> 2437.98]  It's okay to feel sad when people get hurt.
[2439.18 --> 2441.96]  It's okay to feel sad when bad things happen.
[2442.12 --> 2443.08]  And that's called lament.
[2443.22 --> 2444.12]  We can feel sad.
[2445.50 --> 2445.70]  And...
[2445.70 --> 2446.30]  But you know what else?
[2446.30 --> 2447.40]  Jesus says in our passage.
[2447.52 --> 2450.96]  He says, take heart, for I have overcome the world.
[2452.26 --> 2456.74]  So, Jesus says, war is bad, and we can feel sad about it.
[2457.26 --> 2459.02]  But we don't have to do what?
[2459.94 --> 2461.14]  Do we have to be afraid?
[2463.04 --> 2463.80]  What do you think?
[2464.38 --> 2465.38]  We don't have to.
[2465.84 --> 2466.26]  That's right.
[2466.30 --> 2467.26]  We don't have to be afraid.
[2467.36 --> 2467.80]  Why not?
[2468.90 --> 2471.82]  Because if you're not afraid, you don't have to be afraid.
[2471.84 --> 2472.28]  That's true.
[2473.24 --> 2475.48]  And Jesus is the king.
[2475.48 --> 2476.92]  Jesus is the true king.
[2477.40 --> 2479.18]  And he will make everything right.
[2479.70 --> 2480.98]  That's why we don't have to be afraid.
[2481.50 --> 2481.64]  Okay?
[2481.70 --> 2482.90]  Jesus is the true king.
[2483.24 --> 2484.42]  And he is...
[2484.42 --> 2485.58]  He will make everything right.
[2485.58 --> 2488.70]  And Jesus also told us we can pray.
[2488.70 --> 2490.56]  So we don't have to be afraid.
[2491.08 --> 2492.68]  We can feel sad.
[2493.72 --> 2495.02]  We can trust in God.
[2495.14 --> 2495.68]  And we can pray.
[2495.76 --> 2498.02]  That's what Christians do when things go bad in the world.
[2498.10 --> 2498.56]  We pray.
[2499.00 --> 2500.30]  So let's pray together.
[2500.30 --> 2506.46]  I want to say some words and I want you to repeat what I say.
[2506.66 --> 2507.42]  Can we try that?
[2508.04 --> 2508.52]  Everyone?
[2509.16 --> 2509.72]  Okay.
[2510.00 --> 2510.28]  Awesome.
[2510.38 --> 2510.52]  Ready?
[2511.84 --> 2512.60]  Dear Lord.
[2513.06 --> 2513.86]  Dear Lord.
[2514.36 --> 2516.30]  Help the Ukrainians.
[2516.54 --> 2518.28]  Help the Ukrainians.
[2518.66 --> 2520.10]  Make them brave.
[2520.52 --> 2521.94]  Make them brave.
[2522.10 --> 2523.66]  Make us brave too.
[2524.06 --> 2525.90]  Make us brave too.
[2525.90 --> 2527.82]  Bring your judgment.
[2530.74 --> 2531.66]  Bring your peace.
[2533.70 --> 2535.12]  Let good prevail.
[2537.52 --> 2538.92]  Hold us fast.
[2541.16 --> 2542.50]  Lord, have mercy.
[2545.10 --> 2545.58]  Amen.
[2547.40 --> 2547.86]  Okay.
[2549.30 --> 2551.00]  Thanks for joining me.
[2552.38 --> 2552.94]  See you.
[2552.94 --> 2554.06]  You guys can go to your class.
[2554.06 --> 2554.16]  Okay.
[2555.90 --> 2571.16]  Thank you.
[2571.16 --> 2590.82]  so it's great to be with you again this morning today is the second sunday in the church season
[2590.82 --> 2600.56]  of lent during these six weeks the church considers the suffering of jesus right the
[2600.56 --> 2612.82]  suffering that jesus endured in his love for the world and lent lent is a dark season and it is a
[2612.82 --> 2620.88]  penitential season it's dark because when you love someone you don't like to slow down and think about
[2620.88 --> 2628.78]  their suffering do you you know jesus you know he tried to talk to his disciples about his suffering
[2628.78 --> 2636.84]  before it happened but they refused to listen they thought that if jesus was the long-awaited king
[2636.84 --> 2644.26]  then his wonderful kingdom was about to begin and they didn't want to listen to this frightening talk
[2644.26 --> 2650.92]  about being delivered to the authorities and about dying on a cross their ears were closed
[2650.92 --> 2658.08]  maybe for some of us today as we enter into the season of lent we don't want to think about
[2658.08 --> 2660.48]  the suffering of jesus on the cross
[2660.48 --> 2668.28]  lent is also a penitential season because when we remember how christ suffered on our behalf
[2668.28 --> 2673.26]  it makes us want to repent and to turn away from evil
[2673.26 --> 2681.90]  so lent is a dark season it's a penitential season but friends there is room for joy even here
[2681.90 --> 2685.70]  because the sufferings of that cross are over
[2685.70 --> 2687.26]  and
[2687.26 --> 2688.26]  sobia
[2688.26 --> 2688.32] ords
[2688.32 --> 2688.90]  okay
[2688.90 --> 2693.24]  holy shit
[2693.24 --> 2693.86]  awesome
[2693.86 --> 2693.98]  oh
