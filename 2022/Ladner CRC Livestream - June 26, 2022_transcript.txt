[997.66 --> 999.52]  Lead me closer.
[1000.98 --> 1005.50]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1007.50 --> 1012.72]  Come and join us in the river.
[1012.72 --> 1018.12]  Come find life beyond compare.
[1018.58 --> 1022.50]  He is calling.
[1023.70 --> 1025.88]  He is waiting.
[1027.38 --> 1032.26]  Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1033.88 --> 1039.32]  Precious Jesus, I am ready.
[1039.32 --> 1045.32]  To surrender every care.
[1045.32 --> 1049.24]  Take my hand now.
[1049.24 --> 1052.28]  Lead me closer.
[1052.28 --> 1058.12]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1058.12 --> 1062.04]  Take my hand now.
[1062.04 --> 1065.96]  Lead me closer.
[1065.96 --> 1071.88]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1071.88 --> 1075.64]  Please be seated.
[1075.64 --> 1075.66]  Please be seated.
[1075.66 --> 1081.58]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1081.58 --> 1092.78]  This is the time for the children, ages three to now grade four, just the younger group, to be dismissed for Kids Life Children's Worship.
[1092.78 --> 1095.58]  So if you have your children, the way they go.
[1095.58 --> 1120.50]  In our time of confession and assurance this morning, I thought I'd spend a few moments for a few thoughts on the greatness of God and how often we have an inadequate response to that.
[1120.50 --> 1126.42]  Your God is too small.
[1126.42 --> 1132.34]  That was the title of a book written in 1987 by a fellow named J.B. Phillips.
[1132.34 --> 1142.18]  And the book had several points, but one of the major ones was that maybe from our childhood we have thought of God in a constrained way.
[1142.18 --> 1151.30]  We think of God as a man with flowing beards, white hair, long robe, who sits right there.
[1151.30 --> 1158.26]  And in some ways he might be that, but God is so much more.
[1158.26 --> 1159.94]  And that is the point of the book.
[1159.94 --> 1161.78]  Your God is too small.
[1166.34 --> 1173.06]  Let me start by reading some verses from Job 38, pointing out that God is God of heaven and earth.
[1173.06 --> 1176.66]  Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm.
[1176.66 --> 1178.10]  He said, brace yourself.
[1178.10 --> 1181.46]  I will question you and you shall answer me.
[1181.46 --> 1184.50]  Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation?
[1184.50 --> 1186.34]  Tell me if you understand.
[1186.34 --> 1188.34]  Who marked off its dimensions?
[1188.34 --> 1191.22]  Who stretched a measuring line across it?
[1191.22 --> 1196.02]  Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb?
[1196.02 --> 1201.38]  When I said, this far you may come and no further, here is where your proud waves halt.
[1201.38 --> 1206.50]  Have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place?
[1207.62 --> 1210.50]  The earth takes shape like clay under a seal.
[1210.50 --> 1213.30]  Its features stand out like those of a garment.
[1214.02 --> 1217.70]  Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?
[1217.70 --> 1219.22]  Tell me if you know this.
[1220.18 --> 1227.22]  It's kind of fun to read Job being taught by God as I ran this place.
[1227.22 --> 1230.34]  I created this incredible universe that you live in.
[1231.38 --> 1234.58]  God of heaven and earth.
[1234.58 --> 1239.46]  The Old Testament writers assumed that the heaven and earth were approximately equal things.
[1239.46 --> 1245.22]  I mean, you could walk or ride your camel for weeks at a time and not reach the ends of the earth.
[1245.22 --> 1247.14]  And we heard the tales of how far they went.
[1247.14 --> 1253.22]  Or you could get on a ship and sail to the edges of the earth and you didn't know what would happen when you got there.
[1253.22 --> 1255.46]  Maybe you would fall off.
[1255.46 --> 1260.50]  When Jonah was trying to get away from God and Nineveh, he hired a ship and said,
[1260.50 --> 1263.06]  take me to the farthest place that you can possibly go.
[1263.06 --> 1265.62]  And the guy that ran the ship says, well, that's Tarshish.
[1265.62 --> 1266.26]  Let's go there.
[1267.14 --> 1268.42]  And so Jonah said, okay.
[1268.42 --> 1272.50]  Now, most people believe Tarshish was actually on the south coast of Spain.
[1272.50 --> 1274.74]  So there was a whole lot more earth out there.
[1274.74 --> 1281.62]  But the whole point was the earth was a big place and the heavens was about the same size.
[1281.62 --> 1283.62]  I mean, it goes from here to here.
[1283.62 --> 1287.70]  And we all know that God glued those points of light up there.
[1287.94 --> 1290.58]  And wherever I go, it's still from here to here.
[1290.58 --> 1293.30]  So the heavens and the earth are about the same.
[1295.06 --> 1296.10]  That's not reality.
[1301.30 --> 1305.56]  A couple months ago, Len Batarank, the pastor, joined us.
[1305.94 --> 1311.48]  And part of his sermon was to show us a picture taken from one of these satellites as it was,
[1311.48 --> 1316.92]  I think it was Voyager 2, leaving the heliosphere, the area around the sun.
[1316.92 --> 1319.64]  And it was a tiny little blue dot.
[1319.64 --> 1321.64]  And that blue dot was the earth.
[1322.92 --> 1329.08]  Everything that ever happened to humanity has happened on that tiny blue dot.
[1330.60 --> 1333.16]  And then the Hubble telescope looked in the other direction.
[1334.12 --> 1340.44]  And that blue dot is circling around one star, which is one of 10,000 stars in our particular galaxy.
[1340.44 --> 1346.12]  And Hubble has figured out that there are 50 billion more galaxies.
[1348.04 --> 1350.20]  Huge universe out there.
[1351.16 --> 1352.68]  God runs all this.
[1352.68 --> 1355.00]  That's a half a quadrillion stars.
[1355.00 --> 1357.24]  That even exceeds the U.S. national debt.
[1360.76 --> 1363.40]  The heavens is a very large place.
[1363.88 --> 1365.32]  God was there at the beginning.
[1365.32 --> 1367.40]  Many think that was 13 billion years ago.
[1367.88 --> 1369.00]  He's there now.
[1370.36 --> 1374.04]  He could be here in both places simultaneously.
[1374.60 --> 1379.00]  God is a very large and important being.
[1379.00 --> 1387.88]  Is it any wonder he said, repeated by Isaiah 55,
[1388.44 --> 1392.76]  for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways?
[1394.20 --> 1398.44]  Or is it any wonder that he focused on the first two commandments by saying,
[1398.60 --> 1400.28]  I am the Lord your God.
[1400.28 --> 1403.48]  Do not worship any other gods than the one true God.
[1403.48 --> 1405.08]  Other gods are false gods.
[1405.88 --> 1407.08]  Worship me alone.
[1407.64 --> 1412.28]  You shall have no other gods before me, nor shall you make unto thee any graven image.
[1412.28 --> 1419.00]  Now we don't believe in Buddha or Baal, or we don't worship a golden calf,
[1419.56 --> 1424.60]  or any of a thousand other gods that humans have created, may imagine.
[1424.60 --> 1430.76]  But an idol can also be anything or anyone you worship by making it more important than God.
[1430.76 --> 1435.56]  If something has your time, attention, and affections, it has your worship and could be an idol.
[1436.12 --> 1444.92]  Don't allow music, TV, computers, sports, or any other thing, activity, or person to be more important in our life than God.
[1444.92 --> 1456.20]  It's a mystery to me, actually, why God puts up with human beings and why it didn't just start over after the fall,
[1456.20 --> 1461.24]  because it didn't seem that human beings don't seem to recognize him for the greatness that he is.
[1462.12 --> 1464.60]  Instead, using our current language, he doubled down.
[1465.72 --> 1467.16]  He said, no, I won't do that.
[1468.04 --> 1471.80]  He sent a portion of his being as a human being called Jesus.
[1471.80 --> 1478.60]  He sent a spirit, a comforter, to inform us of many things and to guide us in many ways.
[1479.16 --> 1481.40]  God stuck there with us.
[1483.32 --> 1485.64]  And he kept the rules really very simple.
[1485.64 --> 1491.80]  He said, you need only to acknowledge my existence and act like it on a daily basis.
[1493.40 --> 1496.36]  This God knows that we will do it imperfectly,
[1496.36 --> 1501.48]  but he's still willing to let us try and to validate that.
[1502.36 --> 1508.04]  To finish off, it's the words of David in Psalm 103 that I found valuable.
[1508.04 --> 1513.76]  God, Jehovah, is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
[1514.44 --> 1517.94]  He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever.
[1517.94 --> 1524.82]  He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us appropriately after our iniquities.
[1527.30 --> 1534.50]  For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving kindness towards them that fear him.
[1535.46 --> 1539.56]  So thanks be to God of the heavens and the earth.
[1539.56 --> 1542.36]  We're going to sing of that right now.
[1543.08 --> 1546.38]  The first verse of the song we will sing has a line,
[1546.50 --> 1548.86]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1549.56 --> 1552.34]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[1553.02 --> 1554.26]  Only a holy God.
[1554.26 --> 1578.26]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1578.26 --> 1590.68]  Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?
[1590.68 --> 1595.58]  Only a holy God.
[1597.58 --> 1602.30]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[1602.30 --> 1608.46]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[1608.46 --> 1613.66]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[1614.86 --> 1619.34]  Only a holy God.
[1619.34 --> 1630.08]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1630.08 --> 1638.54]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1638.54 --> 1643.12]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1652.12 --> 1657.00]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[1657.00 --> 1663.00]  What other power can raise the dead?
[1663.00 --> 1668.60]  What other name remains undefeated?
[1668.60 --> 1674.48]  Only a holy God.
[1674.48 --> 1685.00]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1685.00 --> 1693.00]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1693.00 --> 1698.38]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1698.38 --> 1723.64]  Who else could rescue me from my daily?
[1723.64 --> 1729.64]  Who else would offer his only son?
[1729.64 --> 1734.96]  Who else invites me to call him father?
[1734.96 --> 1740.80]  Only a holy God.
[1740.80 --> 1744.64]  Only my holy God.
[1744.64 --> 1754.64]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1754.64 --> 1756.64]  Come and be holy, the one and the only.
[1756.64 --> 1758.64]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1758.64 --> 1764.36]  Sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1764.36 --> 1768.86]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1769.94 --> 1778.06]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[1778.88 --> 1786.72]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1786.72 --> 1792.16]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1815.04 --> 1816.00]  Suzanne here.
[1816.72 --> 1817.80]  Okay.
[1818.10 --> 1819.82]  Come on up and read the passage for us.
[1819.82 --> 1820.60]  Okay.
[1830.60 --> 1831.76]  Good morning.
[1832.54 --> 1838.22]  Our scripture reading is from Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1 to 3.
[1838.22 --> 1868.22] 
[1868.22 --> 1874.26]  Let's pray.
[1874.26 --> 1887.10]  Let's pray.
[1887.10 --> 1899.02]  Our God and our Heavenly Father, we are thankful for your word, that it is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.
[1899.02 --> 1903.56]  We give thanks, Father, that you have revealed yourself to us.
[1903.56 --> 1908.58]  And as we look at your word this morning, Father, would you bless us in it.
[1908.58 --> 1918.00]  Bring us even now to a place where we can confess sin so that our minds would not be clouded by it.
[1918.00 --> 1921.48]  And that we might benefit from your word.
[1921.48 --> 1923.66]  We ask this in Jesus' name.
[1923.66 --> 1924.58]  Amen.
[1924.58 --> 1924.70]  Amen.
[1925.90 --> 1927.96]  So we've been studying the book of Ephesians.
[1927.96 --> 1928.96]  Ephesians.
[1928.96 --> 1939.52]  And this is a letter written by Paul, who was a Jewish man, who's writing to the church in the city of Ephesus that had both Jews and Gentiles in it.
[1939.52 --> 1951.08]  And the thing we need to know about this is that Jews and Gentiles, there was this racial and religious tension between these two groups.
[1951.18 --> 1953.54]  There was a history of hostility.
[1956.00 --> 1958.52]  But they were trying to learn how to live together.
[1959.62 --> 1963.74]  They were trying to learn what it meant to be the church of Jesus Christ.
[1964.16 --> 1967.52]  One body of people from all tongues, tribes, and nations.
[1967.52 --> 1967.70]  Ephesians.
[1968.48 --> 1969.86]  But it was hard.
[1971.00 --> 1971.88]  It was very hard.
[1972.58 --> 1978.22]  And so we're looking at Ephesians, which is this letter written to the church about the church.
[1979.08 --> 1986.18]  And we're looking to Jesus to teach us about what it means for us today to live as the church.
[1986.86 --> 1990.14]  How can we live as the church together?
[1991.36 --> 1993.82]  So we started a couple weeks ago in chapter 1.
[1994.26 --> 1996.10]  And we're turning today to chapter 2.
[1996.10 --> 1999.16]  And we're just looking at a couple verses, verses 1 through 3.
[1999.64 --> 2006.92]  But before we get into the passage, I want to tell you about something that happened on my recent trip to Jordan, Egypt, and Israel.
[2007.38 --> 2013.50]  I know that, well, maybe some of you have expressed interest in hearing some of it.
[2013.56 --> 2016.34]  And I'll try to weave it in as we go.
[2016.68 --> 2018.34]  So let me share a bit about this.
[2018.66 --> 2019.92]  First, we'll put up the first photo.
[2019.92 --> 2024.06]  Okay, I don't see it there.
[2024.30 --> 2027.16]  So that guy standing up is George.
[2027.34 --> 2028.60]  He was our trip leader.
[2029.14 --> 2031.30]  And we here are in Israel.
[2031.74 --> 2034.06]  We are on top of Mount Arbel.
[2034.06 --> 2042.58]  And so you can see the Galilee there below from the top of the mountain.
[2042.90 --> 2043.92]  It's a very beautiful place.
[2044.76 --> 2046.60]  And we'll look at the next one.
[2047.44 --> 2049.24]  This is a very short video clip.
[2049.24 --> 2052.60]  Just to kind of show you the scenery.
[2052.82 --> 2054.22]  And that is, you know what that is?
[2055.82 --> 2056.90]  That's the Sea of Galilee.
[2058.08 --> 2058.28]  Right?
[2059.32 --> 2060.68]  It's the sea.
[2060.80 --> 2061.48]  It's a big lake.
[2061.54 --> 2063.60]  We're used to big bodies of water around here in BC.
[2063.86 --> 2064.54]  It's a lake.
[2064.62 --> 2066.40]  But it's quite large.
[2066.58 --> 2068.02]  And they call it the Sea of Galilee.
[2068.02 --> 2076.00]  Now, where we are standing on Mount Arbel, maybe this is the place from which Jesus gave the Great Commission.
[2076.90 --> 2078.52]  Because in Matthew it says,
[2079.10 --> 2084.44]  Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them.
[2085.28 --> 2086.00]  Is it that mountain?
[2086.76 --> 2087.48]  We have no idea.
[2087.72 --> 2090.10]  But it's the biggest mountain around Galilee, so maybe.
[2092.74 --> 2096.48]  And also we think maybe it was where Jesus gave the Great Commission.
[2096.48 --> 2097.64]  Because Jesus said,
[2098.00 --> 2100.36]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[2100.46 --> 2103.44]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations.
[2104.62 --> 2107.16]  And what's interesting is, from the top of the mountain,
[2107.98 --> 2114.32]  you can imagine Jesus pointing to all of the cities surrounding the Sea of Galilee.
[2114.62 --> 2115.70]  There's Tiberias.
[2116.30 --> 2118.58]  Tiberias was a classic Roman city,
[2118.94 --> 2123.14]  which had Romans, but also Jews who were called the Hellenists.
[2123.14 --> 2128.68]  The Hellenists, they were Jews who were kind of like secularized Jews or acculturated Jews.
[2128.76 --> 2132.84]  They were just Jews who were just part of the Roman culture.
[2133.42 --> 2135.94]  They benefited from their connection to Herod.
[2137.38 --> 2140.22]  Then across the sea was the Decapolis,
[2140.74 --> 2142.54]  a cluster of ten Roman cities.
[2142.74 --> 2145.52]  They had a legion of Roman soldiers stationed there,
[2145.94 --> 2149.26]  whose job it was to maintain Pax Romana in the Galilee.
[2149.26 --> 2152.28]  It was a Roman city.
[2152.98 --> 2156.22]  It had pagan temples and pagan worship and worldview.
[2157.00 --> 2159.96]  It was known by the Jews as the other side,
[2160.46 --> 2161.92]  or a far country.
[2162.68 --> 2163.80]  So Jesus sometimes said,
[2163.90 --> 2165.20]  I'm going to the other side.
[2165.30 --> 2166.00]  That's where he went.
[2166.70 --> 2168.14]  The prodigal son went to a far country.
[2168.28 --> 2169.26]  That's probably where he went.
[2171.04 --> 2172.90]  So Jesus spent time in these places.
[2173.48 --> 2175.80]  And across the way, there was the city of the Zealots.
[2176.20 --> 2177.18]  So all these different people,
[2177.18 --> 2180.68]  and he's standing there, he's pointing to these cities,
[2180.84 --> 2182.00]  all these different worldviews,
[2182.04 --> 2184.28]  the Jews, the Zealots, the Roman pagans,
[2184.32 --> 2184.78]  and he's saying,
[2184.98 --> 2187.36]  go make disciples of all the nations.
[2190.12 --> 2191.36]  Maybe that's where he was.
[2193.16 --> 2194.64]  But he definitely said those words.
[2195.44 --> 2196.16]  He was there somewhere.
[2198.12 --> 2199.98]  But that's not why I'm telling you this story at all.
[2200.28 --> 2203.32]  So what happened was that we were on top of Mount Arbel,
[2203.52 --> 2204.82]  we're hiking on the top of the mountain,
[2204.82 --> 2209.26]  and we heard the distinctive sound of a helicopter.
[2210.20 --> 2213.76]  And we could see it approaching from the distance,
[2213.86 --> 2215.76]  coming closer, flying right toward us.
[2217.72 --> 2219.16]  And as it approached,
[2219.36 --> 2222.36]  it came in lower, below where we were standing,
[2222.72 --> 2224.36]  and it just stood right there,
[2224.42 --> 2224.98]  and it was hovering.
[2225.10 --> 2226.48]  You could see the chopper blades.
[2226.56 --> 2227.38]  It was very loud.
[2227.38 --> 2230.14]  And of course,
[2230.82 --> 2232.10]  as we saw,
[2232.22 --> 2233.30]  as the helicopter came closer,
[2233.40 --> 2235.02]  we saw what kind of helicopter it was.
[2235.16 --> 2236.48]  It was a rescue helicopter.
[2237.50 --> 2238.06]  And of course,
[2238.12 --> 2239.24]  you know that someone
[2239.24 --> 2241.20]  was in trouble,
[2241.50 --> 2243.74]  because they only send the rescue helicopter
[2243.74 --> 2245.68]  into the mountains
[2245.68 --> 2248.00]  if someone is badly hurt
[2248.00 --> 2249.50]  and in need of rescue.
[2250.50 --> 2252.16]  And so here's a photo.
[2252.28 --> 2253.04]  I did not take this.
[2253.10 --> 2253.66]  This was from
[2253.66 --> 2255.32]  Israel News.
[2255.32 --> 2257.62]  So what happened was
[2257.62 --> 2260.04]  we found out that a 12-year-old boy
[2260.04 --> 2261.14]  who was hiking below,
[2261.26 --> 2262.64]  there's these natural caves
[2262.64 --> 2263.88]  and hiking trails,
[2264.60 --> 2266.48]  a rock had fallen from the cliff
[2266.48 --> 2267.92]  and struck him in the head.
[2268.56 --> 2269.64]  It was very serious.
[2271.18 --> 2272.48]  So his friends called,
[2272.56 --> 2272.72]  you know,
[2272.76 --> 2273.20]  emergency,
[2273.52 --> 2275.08]  they flew the helicopter in,
[2275.26 --> 2276.76]  and they got to him very quickly
[2276.76 --> 2278.72]  and brought him to the hospital.
[2278.72 --> 2281.52]  And I hadn't thought about this
[2281.52 --> 2282.30]  since this week,
[2282.34 --> 2283.44]  and I looked it up online
[2283.44 --> 2285.50]  and found out from the news report
[2285.50 --> 2286.52]  that he was okay.
[2287.10 --> 2287.52]  So, yay.
[2288.00 --> 2288.98]  He was saved.
[2290.22 --> 2290.70]  But you know,
[2290.78 --> 2292.06]  if a rescue helicopter
[2292.06 --> 2293.98]  swoops down and rescues you,
[2294.52 --> 2296.10]  that's an amazing experience.
[2296.52 --> 2296.66]  Right?
[2296.70 --> 2297.92]  You'll never forget that
[2297.92 --> 2298.84]  the rest of your life.
[2299.70 --> 2301.26]  But what had to happen first?
[2302.26 --> 2302.74]  First,
[2302.86 --> 2303.64]  you had to be
[2303.64 --> 2306.22]  in serious trouble.
[2307.38 --> 2307.64]  Right?
[2307.68 --> 2308.48]  To tell the story
[2308.48 --> 2309.50]  that you were rescued,
[2310.26 --> 2311.70]  you have to first realize,
[2312.26 --> 2313.24]  I was in trouble,
[2313.48 --> 2314.98]  I couldn't save myself,
[2315.20 --> 2315.72]  in fact,
[2315.78 --> 2316.90]  I would have died,
[2317.70 --> 2318.66]  and I can't believe
[2318.66 --> 2319.58]  someone came
[2319.58 --> 2320.92]  and rescued me.
[2322.22 --> 2323.54]  And the reason I'm telling you
[2323.54 --> 2324.48]  this story is because
[2324.48 --> 2325.88]  I think that's somewhat
[2325.88 --> 2326.74]  what is happening
[2326.74 --> 2327.98]  in our passage this morning.
[2328.84 --> 2331.42]  Paul begins Ephesians chapter 2
[2331.42 --> 2332.56]  verses 1 to 3
[2332.56 --> 2333.88]  by giving us
[2333.88 --> 2336.52]  the bad news first.
[2337.54 --> 2338.86]  So that we can then
[2338.86 --> 2340.56]  be absolutely astonished
[2340.56 --> 2341.52]  and amazed
[2341.52 --> 2342.96]  by the good news
[2342.96 --> 2344.90]  that God came to rescue us.
[2345.20 --> 2346.02]  That he has come
[2346.02 --> 2346.96]  and saved us
[2346.96 --> 2348.52]  as an act of incredible
[2348.52 --> 2349.32]  grace and mercy
[2349.32 --> 2350.90]  just because he loved us.
[2352.10 --> 2352.58]  But friends,
[2352.90 --> 2355.18]  sin is the first part
[2355.18 --> 2355.88]  of the message
[2355.88 --> 2356.96]  of the Christian gospel.
[2357.98 --> 2358.54]  You know,
[2358.58 --> 2359.26]  when Jesus
[2359.26 --> 2362.04]  began his public ministry
[2362.04 --> 2362.90]  in Capernaum,
[2363.26 --> 2365.22]  the first words he spoke
[2365.22 --> 2367.14]  were repent
[2367.14 --> 2369.30]  for the kingdom of God
[2369.30 --> 2370.04]  is at hand.
[2370.82 --> 2370.94]  Right?
[2371.00 --> 2372.00]  Those were the first three
[2372.00 --> 2372.96]  words recorded
[2372.96 --> 2373.96]  Jesus speaking
[2373.96 --> 2375.78]  right after his baptism.
[2376.34 --> 2376.88]  Repent
[2376.88 --> 2378.28]  for the kingdom of God
[2378.28 --> 2378.86]  is at hand.
[2379.96 --> 2380.66]  And that means
[2380.66 --> 2381.22]  that the church
[2381.22 --> 2382.04]  in this world
[2382.04 --> 2383.66]  cannot proclaim
[2383.66 --> 2385.16]  the gospel accurately
[2385.16 --> 2386.74]  unless it starts
[2386.74 --> 2387.76]  with the thunder
[2387.76 --> 2389.52]  and the storm clouds
[2389.52 --> 2390.46]  of our sin
[2390.46 --> 2391.18]  and the problem
[2391.18 --> 2391.98]  that our sin
[2391.98 --> 2394.02]  has brought to us.
[2395.18 --> 2396.22]  The Bible
[2396.22 --> 2397.22]  tells us
[2397.22 --> 2397.94]  that we are
[2397.94 --> 2399.84]  Adam's fallen race.
[2400.52 --> 2402.30]  That we are blinded
[2402.30 --> 2403.28]  to the truth
[2403.28 --> 2404.30]  of God.
[2405.08 --> 2406.52]  That our appetite
[2406.52 --> 2408.12]  is not for God
[2408.12 --> 2408.58]  but rather
[2408.58 --> 2409.60]  our appetites
[2409.60 --> 2411.14]  are for ourselves
[2411.14 --> 2412.74]  and not him.
[2413.72 --> 2414.22]  And sometimes
[2414.22 --> 2415.04]  people,
[2415.18 --> 2416.08]  even Christians
[2416.08 --> 2416.78]  in pews
[2416.78 --> 2417.48]  on Sunday mornings
[2417.48 --> 2418.34]  like we are
[2418.34 --> 2420.28]  want to say,
[2420.48 --> 2420.84]  well, you know,
[2420.88 --> 2422.28]  we all have problems
[2422.28 --> 2424.24]  but it's not that bad.
[2425.56 --> 2426.28]  But friends,
[2426.36 --> 2427.16]  the Bible says
[2427.16 --> 2428.22]  that it is
[2428.22 --> 2430.08]  that bad.
[2430.08 --> 2432.42]  It's so bad
[2432.42 --> 2433.40]  that God the Father
[2433.40 --> 2435.26]  sent his beloved son
[2435.26 --> 2436.26]  into the world
[2436.26 --> 2439.04]  to be despicably treated,
[2439.26 --> 2440.18]  to be mauled
[2440.18 --> 2441.12]  and beaten
[2441.12 --> 2442.08]  almost to death
[2442.08 --> 2443.08]  and then crucified
[2443.08 --> 2444.58]  where he gave up
[2444.58 --> 2445.18]  his life
[2445.18 --> 2446.52]  for us
[2446.52 --> 2447.42]  for those
[2447.42 --> 2448.18]  who believe in him.
[2449.06 --> 2450.78]  That's how bad
[2450.78 --> 2452.20]  it was.
[2453.48 --> 2454.54]  And the problem
[2454.54 --> 2454.90]  is though
[2454.90 --> 2455.52]  that we have
[2455.52 --> 2456.44]  a strong tolerance
[2456.44 --> 2457.02]  for sin.
[2458.06 --> 2458.18]  Right?
[2458.30 --> 2458.54]  Our,
[2458.78 --> 2459.64]  we have this casual
[2459.64 --> 2460.06]  attitude
[2460.06 --> 2461.44]  towards sin
[2461.44 --> 2462.24]  in ourselves,
[2463.00 --> 2463.48]  not so much
[2463.48 --> 2464.12]  in other people,
[2464.54 --> 2465.38]  in ourselves
[2465.38 --> 2466.68]  and in the culture
[2466.68 --> 2467.24]  at large.
[2468.38 --> 2469.32]  And what the problem
[2469.32 --> 2470.08]  is that makes it
[2470.08 --> 2471.14]  hard for us
[2471.14 --> 2471.82]  to hear
[2471.82 --> 2472.64]  what the Bible
[2472.64 --> 2473.26]  says
[2473.26 --> 2474.78]  is the serious
[2474.78 --> 2475.42]  problem
[2475.42 --> 2476.28]  that sin is.
[2477.64 --> 2478.62]  So in this passage
[2478.62 --> 2479.08]  this morning
[2479.08 --> 2479.92]  let's look at
[2479.92 --> 2480.40]  what the Bible
[2480.40 --> 2481.24]  actually says
[2481.24 --> 2482.36]  about the human condition.
[2482.94 --> 2484.06]  Because the Holy Spirit
[2484.06 --> 2485.36]  uses the Bible,
[2485.46 --> 2485.84]  the Holy Spirit
[2485.84 --> 2487.04]  uses the Word of God
[2487.04 --> 2488.62]  to convict us
[2488.62 --> 2489.92]  of our sin
[2489.92 --> 2491.10]  to bring us
[2491.10 --> 2491.96]  to a place
[2491.96 --> 2492.80]  where we can see
[2492.80 --> 2493.42]  the gospel
[2493.42 --> 2495.18]  for the good news
[2495.18 --> 2496.32]  that it is.
[2498.44 --> 2499.40]  So what do we need
[2499.40 --> 2500.38]  to be rescued from?
[2501.80 --> 2502.76]  Paul says
[2502.76 --> 2504.04]  in verse 1
[2504.04 --> 2505.62]  which we'll put here
[2505.62 --> 2507.38]  you need to be
[2507.38 --> 2508.38]  rescued from death.
[2509.64 --> 2510.06]  Okay,
[2510.08 --> 2511.00]  that's pretty serious.
[2512.16 --> 2513.32]  He says in verse 1
[2513.32 --> 2514.28]  as for you
[2514.28 --> 2516.18]  plural
[2516.18 --> 2517.98]  as for y'all
[2517.98 --> 2520.38]  you were dead
[2520.38 --> 2521.88]  in your transgressions
[2521.88 --> 2522.28]  and sins
[2522.28 --> 2522.88]  in which
[2522.88 --> 2524.48]  you used to live.
[2525.52 --> 2526.12]  Remember he says
[2526.12 --> 2526.88]  you were.
[2527.42 --> 2528.12]  Remember this is
[2528.12 --> 2529.60]  what we were.
[2530.68 --> 2531.30]  Paul is writing
[2531.30 --> 2531.86]  to the church
[2531.86 --> 2532.34]  in Ephesus
[2532.34 --> 2534.72]  who he addressed
[2534.72 --> 2535.50]  in chapter 1
[2535.50 --> 2536.90]  to God's holy people.
[2537.90 --> 2537.96]  Right,
[2538.02 --> 2538.48]  so he's writing
[2538.48 --> 2538.94]  to people
[2538.94 --> 2539.62]  who believe
[2539.62 --> 2540.12]  the gospel
[2540.12 --> 2541.52]  who are now
[2541.52 --> 2542.26]  made alive
[2542.26 --> 2542.92]  in Christ
[2542.92 --> 2544.96]  but who need
[2544.96 --> 2545.60]  to remember
[2545.60 --> 2548.14]  who they were.
[2549.02 --> 2549.80]  How they used
[2549.80 --> 2550.26]  to live.
[2550.56 --> 2550.88]  He says
[2550.88 --> 2551.50]  you were dead
[2551.50 --> 2552.66]  in your transgressions
[2552.66 --> 2553.28]  and sins
[2553.28 --> 2554.28]  in which you used
[2554.28 --> 2554.70]  to live.
[2555.68 --> 2556.50]  This is,
[2556.64 --> 2556.80]  friends,
[2556.92 --> 2557.86]  what we are never
[2557.86 --> 2558.50]  to forget.
[2559.16 --> 2559.90]  That apart
[2559.90 --> 2560.76]  from God's grace
[2560.76 --> 2561.72]  we would still
[2561.72 --> 2562.70]  be on the path
[2562.70 --> 2563.60]  to condemnation
[2563.60 --> 2564.76]  under the wrath
[2564.76 --> 2565.22]  of God
[2565.22 --> 2567.04]  absolutely deserving
[2567.04 --> 2567.92]  of the hell
[2567.92 --> 2568.68]  that is coming
[2568.68 --> 2569.40]  toward us.
[2570.12 --> 2570.96]  But then
[2570.96 --> 2571.86]  it's the Christian's
[2571.86 --> 2572.88]  testimony to say
[2572.88 --> 2575.20]  this is what I was
[2575.20 --> 2577.28]  but thanks be to God
[2577.28 --> 2578.46]  in verse 4
[2578.46 --> 2579.08]  Paul will say
[2579.08 --> 2579.86]  but God
[2579.86 --> 2581.58]  because of his
[2581.58 --> 2582.44]  great love for us
[2582.44 --> 2584.12]  made us alive
[2584.12 --> 2585.04]  with Christ.
[2586.16 --> 2586.96]  And we're going
[2586.96 --> 2587.38]  to look at that
[2587.38 --> 2587.92]  next week.
[2588.40 --> 2589.22]  But first
[2589.22 --> 2590.36]  Paul wants us
[2590.36 --> 2591.04]  to understand
[2591.04 --> 2592.38]  what we have
[2592.38 --> 2593.38]  been rescued from.
[2594.84 --> 2595.96]  So we were dead
[2595.96 --> 2596.76]  in transgressions
[2596.76 --> 2597.38]  and sins.
[2598.16 --> 2599.34]  So he says here
[2599.34 --> 2600.00]  we're not talking
[2600.00 --> 2601.42]  about physical death.
[2601.98 --> 2602.46]  He says yeah
[2602.46 --> 2602.98]  of course
[2602.98 --> 2603.34]  you're all
[2603.34 --> 2604.52]  walking around
[2604.52 --> 2607.88]  and actually
[2607.88 --> 2608.98]  having been made
[2608.98 --> 2609.88]  in the image of God
[2609.88 --> 2610.60]  we all continue
[2610.60 --> 2611.68]  to bear that glory.
[2613.10 --> 2613.92]  Glimmers of glory
[2613.92 --> 2615.06]  are still seen
[2615.06 --> 2616.80]  in our lives.
[2617.58 --> 2618.68]  But Paul says
[2618.68 --> 2619.88]  you were dead.
[2620.70 --> 2621.38]  And what he means
[2621.38 --> 2621.94]  by that
[2621.94 --> 2622.82]  is that we are not
[2622.82 --> 2623.98]  able to respond
[2623.98 --> 2624.82]  to God
[2624.82 --> 2625.70]  spiritually.
[2625.70 --> 2627.88]  we are utterly
[2627.88 --> 2628.74]  unable
[2628.74 --> 2629.92]  in and of
[2629.92 --> 2630.56]  ourselves
[2630.56 --> 2631.62]  to decide
[2631.62 --> 2632.64]  to believe
[2632.64 --> 2633.20]  in Jesus.
[2634.22 --> 2635.22]  We are blind
[2635.22 --> 2636.02]  to his beauty.
[2636.74 --> 2637.44]  We are deaf
[2637.44 --> 2638.50]  to his truth.
[2638.76 --> 2639.30]  Our lips
[2639.30 --> 2640.08]  cannot taste
[2640.08 --> 2640.98]  his sweetness.
[2642.08 --> 2643.24]  We are dead
[2643.24 --> 2644.40]  to God.
[2645.56 --> 2646.38]  And when theologians
[2646.38 --> 2647.12]  talk about this
[2647.12 --> 2647.98]  they talk about
[2647.98 --> 2649.32]  the freedom
[2649.32 --> 2649.98]  of the will.
[2650.70 --> 2651.28]  The freedom
[2651.28 --> 2651.88]  of the will.
[2651.88 --> 2653.82]  And that comes
[2653.82 --> 2654.40]  from what Jesus
[2654.40 --> 2655.50]  says in John
[2655.50 --> 2656.18]  chapter 8
[2656.18 --> 2657.38]  which we'll put up
[2657.38 --> 2657.54]  here.
[2657.64 --> 2658.46]  In John chapter 8
[2658.46 --> 2659.30]  Jesus says
[2659.30 --> 2660.48]  very truly I tell you
[2660.48 --> 2661.80]  everyone who sins
[2661.80 --> 2663.24]  is a slave to sin
[2663.24 --> 2665.02]  so if the son
[2665.02 --> 2666.06]  sets you free
[2666.06 --> 2667.34]  you will be free
[2667.34 --> 2667.76]  indeed.
[2669.02 --> 2669.60]  There's a lot
[2669.60 --> 2670.48]  in that passage.
[2672.54 --> 2673.28]  He says
[2673.28 --> 2673.88]  we are all
[2673.88 --> 2674.96]  slaves to sin
[2674.96 --> 2676.88]  and if we are free
[2676.88 --> 2677.46]  we are made free
[2677.46 --> 2678.00]  by Jesus.
[2678.72 --> 2679.52]  So here's a helpful
[2679.52 --> 2680.56]  way to think about this.
[2680.56 --> 2682.38]  I heard a theologian
[2682.38 --> 2683.24]  put it like this.
[2684.00 --> 2685.00]  You're only free
[2685.00 --> 2685.72]  to do what you
[2685.72 --> 2686.54]  are able to do.
[2687.60 --> 2688.38]  Let me say that again.
[2689.24 --> 2690.16]  You are only
[2690.16 --> 2691.94]  free to do
[2691.94 --> 2693.66]  what you are
[2693.66 --> 2694.62]  able
[2694.62 --> 2695.76]  to do.
[2697.10 --> 2697.98]  Are you able
[2697.98 --> 2698.84]  to fly like a bird?
[2700.48 --> 2700.96]  No.
[2702.18 --> 2703.66]  God didn't give us wings
[2703.66 --> 2704.42]  therefore
[2704.42 --> 2705.58]  I am not
[2705.58 --> 2706.54]  free
[2706.54 --> 2707.64]  to fly.
[2708.06 --> 2708.62]  Don't tell me
[2708.62 --> 2709.12]  to fly
[2709.12 --> 2710.20]  because I can't.
[2710.56 --> 2711.10]  I am not
[2711.10 --> 2711.72]  able to fly.
[2712.26 --> 2713.00]  I am not
[2713.00 --> 2713.60]  free to
[2713.60 --> 2714.30]  bench press
[2714.30 --> 2715.24]  200 pounds.
[2716.54 --> 2717.42]  I cannot
[2717.42 --> 2718.88]  get that much
[2718.88 --> 2719.36]  weight up.
[2720.48 --> 2721.32]  So you're only
[2721.32 --> 2722.36]  free to do
[2722.36 --> 2722.98]  what you are
[2722.98 --> 2723.66]  able to do.
[2723.70 --> 2723.96]  If you're not
[2723.96 --> 2724.52]  able to do it
[2724.52 --> 2724.80]  you're not
[2724.80 --> 2725.40]  free to do it.
[2725.46 --> 2725.96]  You don't have
[2725.96 --> 2726.40]  that freedom.
[2727.48 --> 2728.02]  So when Paul
[2728.02 --> 2728.96]  says here in verse 1
[2728.96 --> 2729.62]  you are dead
[2729.62 --> 2730.54]  in your transgressions
[2730.54 --> 2731.18]  and sins
[2731.18 --> 2732.42]  and if I am
[2732.42 --> 2733.34]  spiritually dead
[2733.34 --> 2733.92]  to God
[2733.92 --> 2734.66]  I am not
[2734.66 --> 2735.62]  free
[2735.62 --> 2736.92]  to move
[2736.92 --> 2738.04]  in his direction.
[2738.04 --> 2739.30]  I don't
[2739.30 --> 2739.68]  have that
[2739.68 --> 2740.04]  ability.
[2740.18 --> 2740.40]  I don't
[2740.40 --> 2740.74]  have that
[2740.74 --> 2741.06]  freedom.
[2742.20 --> 2742.64]  Nobody
[2742.64 --> 2743.60]  ever got up
[2743.60 --> 2743.98]  one day
[2743.98 --> 2744.46]  and said
[2744.46 --> 2745.36]  you know
[2745.36 --> 2745.86]  that's it.
[2745.98 --> 2746.70]  I am tired
[2746.70 --> 2747.24]  of my life.
[2747.32 --> 2747.62]  I'm going to
[2747.62 --> 2748.02]  turn over
[2748.02 --> 2748.68]  a new leaf.
[2749.20 --> 2749.62]  I am
[2749.62 --> 2750.52]  walking
[2750.52 --> 2751.18]  toward God.
[2752.18 --> 2752.70]  Nobody
[2752.70 --> 2753.38]  ever
[2753.38 --> 2754.30]  does that
[2754.30 --> 2755.24]  because nobody
[2755.24 --> 2756.12]  can
[2756.12 --> 2757.02]  do that.
[2757.76 --> 2758.16]  Nobody
[2758.16 --> 2758.76]  is free
[2758.76 --> 2759.30]  to do that.
[2759.36 --> 2759.54]  No one
[2759.54 --> 2760.26]  has the ability
[2760.26 --> 2761.00]  to do that.
[2761.00 --> 2761.98]  They first
[2761.98 --> 2762.68]  have to be
[2762.68 --> 2763.30]  changed
[2763.30 --> 2764.22]  by God.
[2764.42 --> 2764.74]  They have
[2764.74 --> 2764.94]  to be
[2764.94 --> 2765.56]  given the
[2765.56 --> 2766.00]  ability.
[2766.40 --> 2766.64]  They have
[2766.64 --> 2766.90]  to be
[2766.90 --> 2767.66]  set free
[2767.66 --> 2768.86]  by Jesus.
[2770.14 --> 2770.48]  And so
[2770.48 --> 2771.20]  the difference
[2771.20 --> 2771.70]  between a
[2771.70 --> 2772.20]  person over
[2772.20 --> 2772.56]  here
[2772.56 --> 2774.22]  who is not
[2774.22 --> 2774.96]  free to
[2774.96 --> 2775.58]  believe in
[2775.58 --> 2776.24]  Christ as
[2776.24 --> 2776.76]  her Savior
[2776.76 --> 2777.52]  and the
[2777.52 --> 2778.06]  person over
[2778.06 --> 2778.52]  here who
[2778.52 --> 2779.46]  does believe
[2779.46 --> 2779.88]  in Christ
[2779.88 --> 2780.52]  as her Savior
[2780.52 --> 2782.22]  and who is
[2782.22 --> 2783.20]  in communion
[2783.20 --> 2783.72]  with God
[2783.72 --> 2784.36]  and who reads
[2784.36 --> 2784.96]  God's word
[2784.96 --> 2785.54]  and prays
[2785.54 --> 2786.08]  to God
[2786.08 --> 2787.76]  is that
[2787.76 --> 2788.88]  this person
[2788.88 --> 2789.62]  has the
[2789.62 --> 2790.12]  ability to
[2790.12 --> 2790.48]  do it.
[2790.62 --> 2791.26]  I get confused.
[2791.26 --> 2792.68]  And the
[2792.68 --> 2793.22]  other person
[2793.22 --> 2793.72]  does not.
[2795.22 --> 2795.98]  The person
[2795.98 --> 2797.26]  who believes
[2797.26 --> 2797.70]  in God
[2797.70 --> 2798.88]  has the
[2798.88 --> 2799.44]  ability to
[2799.44 --> 2799.82]  do it.
[2800.12 --> 2800.76]  This person
[2800.76 --> 2801.32]  does not
[2801.32 --> 2801.82]  have the
[2801.82 --> 2802.22]  ability.
[2803.28 --> 2803.64]  And what
[2803.64 --> 2804.10]  gives this
[2804.10 --> 2804.60]  person the
[2804.60 --> 2805.24]  ability to
[2805.24 --> 2805.56]  do it
[2805.56 --> 2805.96]  is the
[2805.96 --> 2806.54]  Holy Spirit
[2806.54 --> 2807.50]  that God
[2807.50 --> 2808.18]  sent into
[2808.18 --> 2808.78]  that person's
[2808.78 --> 2809.94]  life enabling
[2809.94 --> 2811.20]  them to
[2811.20 --> 2811.60]  do it.
[2813.38 --> 2814.44]  So the
[2814.44 --> 2814.96]  Bible says
[2814.96 --> 2815.22]  there are
[2815.22 --> 2815.68]  fundamentally
[2815.68 --> 2816.80]  two kinds
[2816.80 --> 2817.22]  of people
[2817.22 --> 2817.58]  in the
[2817.58 --> 2817.94]  world.
[2818.84 --> 2819.34]  Spiritually
[2819.34 --> 2820.20]  alive people
[2820.20 --> 2820.70]  who have
[2820.70 --> 2821.32]  the Holy Spirit
[2821.32 --> 2821.92]  in them
[2821.92 --> 2823.28]  giving them
[2823.28 --> 2824.12]  spiritual life
[2824.12 --> 2826.04]  restoring their
[2826.04 --> 2827.52]  ability to
[2827.52 --> 2828.16]  then freely
[2828.16 --> 2829.26]  choose
[2829.26 --> 2830.28]  Christ.
[2831.14 --> 2831.80]  And people
[2831.80 --> 2832.24]  who because
[2832.24 --> 2832.64]  of sin
[2832.64 --> 2833.26]  have lost
[2833.26 --> 2833.80]  the ability
[2833.80 --> 2834.24]  to choose
[2834.24 --> 2834.70]  Christ
[2834.70 --> 2835.76]  who Paul
[2835.76 --> 2836.18]  says are
[2836.18 --> 2836.52]  spiritually
[2836.52 --> 2836.88]  dead.
[2839.38 --> 2840.26]  And Paul
[2840.26 --> 2841.04]  is reminding
[2841.04 --> 2841.92]  us that
[2841.92 --> 2842.74]  this is
[2842.74 --> 2843.52]  what we
[2843.52 --> 2844.36]  were.
[2844.94 --> 2845.48]  We were
[2845.48 --> 2846.18]  all
[2846.18 --> 2847.16]  spiritually
[2847.16 --> 2848.10]  dead in
[2848.10 --> 2848.26]  our
[2848.26 --> 2848.88]  transgressions
[2848.88 --> 2849.34]  and sins
[2849.34 --> 2849.84]  but when
[2849.84 --> 2850.12]  the Holy
[2850.12 --> 2850.34]  Spirit
[2850.34 --> 2851.12]  comes into
[2851.12 --> 2851.56]  a man
[2851.56 --> 2852.18]  or woman
[2852.18 --> 2853.00]  making them
[2853.00 --> 2853.70]  alive to
[2853.70 --> 2854.18]  Christ
[2854.18 --> 2856.68]  we can
[2856.68 --> 2857.22]  hear the
[2857.22 --> 2857.66]  gospel
[2857.66 --> 2859.58]  and then
[2859.58 --> 2859.86]  we can
[2859.86 --> 2860.26]  say
[2860.26 --> 2861.58]  wow
[2861.58 --> 2863.20]  I am
[2863.20 --> 2863.72]  the sinner
[2863.72 --> 2864.64]  God says
[2864.64 --> 2865.32]  I am
[2865.32 --> 2867.04]  and thank
[2867.04 --> 2867.72]  God
[2867.72 --> 2868.52]  because Jesus
[2868.52 --> 2869.24]  has died
[2869.24 --> 2869.78]  for me
[2869.78 --> 2870.86]  because if
[2870.86 --> 2871.36]  he hadn't
[2871.36 --> 2871.72]  I would
[2871.72 --> 2872.36]  still be
[2872.36 --> 2872.68]  under the
[2872.68 --> 2873.32]  condemnation
[2873.32 --> 2874.18]  of God.
[2874.18 --> 2875.18]  God
[2875.18 --> 2876.26]  now how
[2876.26 --> 2876.84]  does a
[2876.84 --> 2877.22]  person
[2877.22 --> 2878.64]  say that?
[2879.12 --> 2879.42]  How are
[2879.42 --> 2880.02]  they able
[2880.02 --> 2880.38]  to say
[2880.38 --> 2880.72]  that?
[2881.20 --> 2881.46]  Did they
[2881.46 --> 2882.74]  just get
[2882.74 --> 2883.20]  smart
[2883.20 --> 2884.30]  and like
[2884.30 --> 2884.80]  wake up
[2884.80 --> 2885.26]  one morning
[2885.26 --> 2886.74]  and able
[2886.74 --> 2886.96]  to do
[2886.96 --> 2887.14]  that?
[2887.20 --> 2887.42]  No.
[2888.02 --> 2888.56]  What happened
[2888.56 --> 2889.12]  is God
[2889.12 --> 2889.92]  has moved
[2889.92 --> 2890.80]  them from
[2890.80 --> 2891.70]  the not
[2891.70 --> 2892.58]  able camp
[2892.58 --> 2893.14]  to the
[2893.14 --> 2893.88]  able camp
[2893.88 --> 2895.28]  and now
[2895.28 --> 2895.62]  that they're
[2895.62 --> 2896.06]  spiritually
[2896.06 --> 2896.86]  alive and
[2896.86 --> 2897.70]  responsive to
[2897.70 --> 2898.04]  God
[2898.04 --> 2899.36]  when the
[2899.36 --> 2899.74]  gospel
[2899.74 --> 2901.06]  is heard
[2901.06 --> 2902.20]  they feel
[2902.20 --> 2902.74]  the guilt
[2902.74 --> 2903.12]  of their
[2903.12 --> 2903.48]  sin
[2903.48 --> 2904.32]  and they
[2904.32 --> 2905.20]  run to
[2905.20 --> 2905.52]  Jesus
[2905.52 --> 2906.26]  as fast
[2906.26 --> 2906.58]  as they
[2906.58 --> 2906.86]  can
[2906.86 --> 2907.32]  and they
[2907.32 --> 2907.80]  plunge
[2907.80 --> 2908.42]  themselves
[2908.42 --> 2909.32]  under the
[2909.32 --> 2909.76]  waterfall
[2909.76 --> 2910.38]  of his
[2910.38 --> 2910.76]  grace.
[2913.34 --> 2914.04]  So we
[2914.04 --> 2914.46]  were dead
[2914.46 --> 2914.70]  in our
[2914.70 --> 2915.28]  transgressions
[2915.28 --> 2915.74]  and sins
[2915.74 --> 2916.26]  we can't
[2916.26 --> 2916.62]  come to
[2916.62 --> 2916.88]  God
[2916.88 --> 2917.84]  on our
[2917.84 --> 2918.24]  own.
[2920.44 --> 2921.28]  Then Paul
[2921.28 --> 2921.80]  goes on
[2921.80 --> 2922.02]  in this
[2922.02 --> 2922.62]  passage to
[2922.62 --> 2923.08]  describe
[2923.08 --> 2923.52]  three
[2923.52 --> 2924.32]  implications
[2924.32 --> 2924.98]  of being
[2924.98 --> 2925.20]  dead
[2925.20 --> 2925.60]  in sin
[2925.60 --> 2926.54]  three
[2926.54 --> 2927.20]  problems
[2927.20 --> 2927.62]  three
[2927.62 --> 2928.68]  results
[2928.68 --> 2929.28]  of our
[2929.28 --> 2929.74]  state
[2929.74 --> 2930.32]  of being
[2930.32 --> 2930.92]  spiritually
[2930.92 --> 2931.28]  dead.
[2932.40 --> 2933.26]  The first
[2933.26 --> 2933.68]  is that
[2933.68 --> 2934.38]  we have
[2934.38 --> 2935.54]  disordered
[2935.54 --> 2936.32]  desires.
[2936.68 --> 2937.46]  Disordered
[2937.46 --> 2938.00]  desires.
[2939.32 --> 2939.92]  We see
[2939.92 --> 2940.24]  this in
[2940.24 --> 2940.42]  verse
[2940.42 --> 2940.76]  three.
[2941.90 --> 2942.12]  Paul
[2942.12 --> 2942.64]  says
[2942.64 --> 2943.72]  all of
[2943.72 --> 2944.12]  us
[2944.12 --> 2944.72]  also
[2944.72 --> 2945.16]  lived
[2945.16 --> 2945.62]  among
[2945.62 --> 2946.00]  them
[2946.00 --> 2946.26]  those
[2946.26 --> 2946.38]  who
[2946.38 --> 2946.46]  are
[2946.46 --> 2946.72]  spiritually
[2946.72 --> 2947.00]  dead
[2947.00 --> 2947.30]  at
[2947.30 --> 2947.50]  one
[2947.50 --> 2947.94]  time
[2947.94 --> 2949.40]  gratifying
[2949.40 --> 2949.60]  the
[2949.60 --> 2950.10]  cravings
[2950.10 --> 2950.32]  of our
[2950.32 --> 2950.66]  flesh
[2950.66 --> 2950.90]  and
[2950.90 --> 2951.26]  following
[2951.26 --> 2951.66]  its
[2951.66 --> 2952.32]  desires
[2952.32 --> 2952.90]  and
[2952.90 --> 2953.34]  thoughts.
[2954.76 --> 2955.50]  Do you
[2955.50 --> 2955.82]  see the
[2955.82 --> 2956.06]  language
[2956.06 --> 2956.72]  of desire
[2956.72 --> 2957.06]  there?
[2958.48 --> 2958.84]  Following
[2958.84 --> 2959.08]  our
[2959.08 --> 2959.62]  desires
[2959.62 --> 2960.56]  gratifying
[2960.56 --> 2961.30]  the cravings
[2961.30 --> 2961.54]  of our
[2961.54 --> 2961.92]  flesh.
[2962.70 --> 2963.38]  Now I
[2963.38 --> 2963.84]  want you
[2963.84 --> 2964.66]  to understand
[2964.66 --> 2966.74]  that desire
[2966.74 --> 2968.16]  in and of
[2968.16 --> 2968.84]  itself
[2968.84 --> 2970.44]  is not
[2970.44 --> 2970.96]  bad.
[2973.96 --> 2974.60]  Sometimes
[2974.60 --> 2974.98]  among
[2974.98 --> 2975.38]  Christians
[2975.38 --> 2976.28]  or people
[2976.28 --> 2976.72]  can have
[2976.72 --> 2978.92]  this idea
[2978.92 --> 2979.48]  about Christians
[2979.48 --> 2979.76]  that we
[2979.76 --> 2980.26]  think desire
[2980.26 --> 2980.72]  is bad.
[2980.82 --> 2981.02]  It's not
[2981.02 --> 2981.36]  true.
[2982.24 --> 2982.60]  Desire
[2982.60 --> 2983.08]  is good.
[2983.14 --> 2983.42]  The Bible
[2983.42 --> 2984.08]  teaches us
[2984.08 --> 2984.40]  that we
[2984.40 --> 2985.20]  were made
[2985.20 --> 2986.44]  by God's
[2986.44 --> 2987.00]  own desire.
[2987.00 --> 2988.08]  We
[2988.08 --> 2988.58]  were made
[2988.58 --> 2989.34]  for
[2989.34 --> 2989.78]  desire.
[2989.92 --> 2990.00]  We
[2990.00 --> 2990.14]  were
[2990.14 --> 2990.40]  made
[2990.40 --> 2990.66]  to
[2990.66 --> 2991.14]  desire
[2991.14 --> 2991.48]  God
[2991.48 --> 2991.80]  and
[2991.80 --> 2991.96]  to
[2991.96 --> 2992.30]  desire
[2992.30 --> 2992.56]  one
[2992.56 --> 2992.90]  another.
[2994.02 --> 2994.24]  You
[2994.24 --> 2994.44]  were
[2994.44 --> 2994.92]  created
[2994.92 --> 2995.36]  to
[2995.36 --> 2995.90]  desire.
[2996.68 --> 2997.24]  That's
[2997.24 --> 2997.52]  good.
[2998.72 --> 2999.20]  But when
[2999.20 --> 2999.42]  we
[2999.42 --> 3000.14]  sinned
[3000.14 --> 3000.34]  we
[3000.34 --> 3000.74]  turned
[3000.74 --> 3001.48]  away
[3001.48 --> 3001.78]  from
[3001.78 --> 3002.16]  God
[3002.16 --> 3002.50]  and as
[3002.50 --> 3002.94]  a result
[3002.94 --> 3003.30]  instead
[3003.30 --> 3003.66]  of our
[3003.66 --> 3004.14]  desires
[3004.14 --> 3004.62]  facing
[3004.62 --> 3005.04]  outward
[3005.04 --> 3005.84]  up to
[3005.84 --> 3006.24]  God
[3006.24 --> 3007.30]  outward
[3007.30 --> 3007.60]  to
[3007.60 --> 3008.12]  others
[3008.12 --> 3008.84]  our
[3008.84 --> 3009.28]  desires
[3009.28 --> 3009.72]  what
[3009.72 --> 3010.06]  happened?
[3010.74 --> 3010.96]  They
[3010.96 --> 3011.34]  began
[3011.34 --> 3011.78]  to
[3011.78 --> 3012.82]  turn
[3012.82 --> 3013.24]  inward
[3013.24 --> 3014.54]  towards
[3014.54 --> 3015.14]  ourselves.
[3015.14 --> 3016.52]  Martin
[3016.52 --> 3016.90]  Luther
[3016.90 --> 3017.30]  said
[3017.30 --> 3017.42]  it
[3017.42 --> 3017.64]  this
[3017.64 --> 3017.86]  way.
[3019.36 --> 3020.04]  He
[3020.04 --> 3020.24]  said
[3020.24 --> 3020.36]  the
[3020.36 --> 3020.62]  human
[3020.62 --> 3021.06]  heart
[3021.06 --> 3021.92]  is
[3021.92 --> 3022.28]  curved
[3022.28 --> 3022.64]  in
[3022.64 --> 3022.92]  upon
[3022.92 --> 3023.42]  itself.
[3024.80 --> 3025.12]  The
[3025.12 --> 3025.38]  human
[3025.38 --> 3025.68]  heart
[3025.68 --> 3025.90]  is
[3025.90 --> 3026.64]  profoundly
[3026.64 --> 3027.60]  self
[3027.60 --> 3028.24]  absorbed
[3028.24 --> 3029.22]  and
[3029.22 --> 3029.68]  self
[3029.68 --> 3030.40]  centered.
[3031.40 --> 3031.66]  It's
[3031.66 --> 3031.90]  like we
[3031.90 --> 3032.00]  have
[3032.00 --> 3032.14]  this
[3032.14 --> 3032.32]  little
[3032.32 --> 3032.80]  computer
[3032.80 --> 3034.66]  in the
[3034.66 --> 3034.84]  very
[3034.84 --> 3035.18]  center
[3035.18 --> 3035.40]  of
[3035.40 --> 3035.56]  our
[3035.56 --> 3035.96]  hearts
[3035.96 --> 3036.36]  and
[3036.36 --> 3036.54]  it's
[3036.54 --> 3036.86]  always
[3036.86 --> 3037.38]  online
[3037.38 --> 3037.68]  and
[3037.68 --> 3037.84]  it's
[3037.84 --> 3038.08]  always
[3038.08 --> 3038.40]  going
[3038.40 --> 3038.80]  24
[3038.80 --> 3039.16]  7
[3039.16 --> 3039.32]  and
[3039.32 --> 3039.48]  what
[3039.48 --> 3039.70]  it's
[3039.70 --> 3040.02]  doing
[3040.02 --> 3040.74]  is
[3040.74 --> 3040.86]  that
[3040.86 --> 3041.02]  it's
[3041.02 --> 3041.40]  looking
[3041.40 --> 3041.80]  at
[3041.80 --> 3042.24]  everything
[3042.24 --> 3042.64]  around
[3042.64 --> 3043.06]  us
[3043.06 --> 3043.82]  and
[3043.82 --> 3043.98]  it's
[3043.98 --> 3044.16]  looking
[3044.16 --> 3044.34]  at
[3044.34 --> 3044.62]  every
[3044.62 --> 3045.30]  situation
[3045.30 --> 3046.06]  every
[3046.06 --> 3046.58]  person
[3046.58 --> 3047.02]  every
[3047.02 --> 3047.68]  encounter
[3047.68 --> 3048.48]  every
[3048.48 --> 3049.10]  interaction
[3049.10 --> 3049.80]  and it's
[3049.80 --> 3050.26]  asking the
[3050.26 --> 3050.64]  question
[3050.64 --> 3051.38]  what's
[3051.38 --> 3051.60]  in it
[3051.60 --> 3051.94]  for me?
[3053.08 --> 3053.46]  How
[3053.46 --> 3053.66]  does
[3053.66 --> 3053.84]  this
[3053.84 --> 3054.16]  benefit
[3054.16 --> 3054.48]  me?
[3054.80 --> 3055.04]  How
[3055.04 --> 3055.24]  does
[3055.24 --> 3055.38]  this
[3055.38 --> 3055.60]  serve
[3055.60 --> 3055.86]  my
[3055.86 --> 3056.20]  interest?
[3056.28 --> 3056.38]  How
[3056.38 --> 3056.52]  does
[3056.52 --> 3056.66]  this
[3056.66 --> 3056.86]  make
[3056.86 --> 3057.04]  me
[3057.04 --> 3057.40]  happy?
[3058.58 --> 3058.70]  And
[3058.70 --> 3058.88]  so
[3058.88 --> 3059.36]  all
[3059.36 --> 3059.68]  of
[3059.68 --> 3060.16]  us
[3060.16 --> 3060.78]  instead
[3060.78 --> 3061.06]  of
[3061.06 --> 3061.76]  desiring
[3061.76 --> 3062.22]  God
[3062.22 --> 3062.40]  and
[3062.40 --> 3062.88]  desiring
[3062.88 --> 3063.50]  other
[3063.50 --> 3063.92]  people
[3063.92 --> 3064.12]  we
[3064.12 --> 3064.36]  started
[3064.36 --> 3064.56]  to
[3064.56 --> 3064.90]  desire
[3064.90 --> 3065.50]  ourselves
[3065.50 --> 3066.56]  and
[3066.56 --> 3066.78]  now
[3066.78 --> 3067.68]  we
[3067.68 --> 3068.32]  use
[3068.32 --> 3068.78]  God
[3068.78 --> 3069.16]  and
[3069.16 --> 3069.36]  we
[3069.36 --> 3069.78]  use
[3069.78 --> 3070.32]  others
[3070.32 --> 3071.14]  to
[3071.14 --> 3071.40]  feed
[3071.40 --> 3071.96]  ourselves
[3071.96 --> 3073.60]  and
[3073.60 --> 3073.74]  so
[3073.74 --> 3073.94]  this
[3073.94 --> 3074.42]  desire
[3074.42 --> 3074.68]  to
[3074.68 --> 3075.30]  love
[3075.30 --> 3075.82]  which
[3075.82 --> 3075.94]  is
[3075.94 --> 3076.08]  a
[3076.08 --> 3076.42]  good
[3076.42 --> 3076.88]  desire
[3076.88 --> 3077.52]  becomes
[3077.52 --> 3077.86]  because
[3077.86 --> 3078.04]  of

[3137.66 --> 3138.44]  now
[3138.44 --> 3138.64]  there's
[3138.64 --> 3138.78]  a
[3138.78 --> 3139.04]  second
[3139.04 --> 3139.64]  implication
[3139.64 --> 3139.94]  of

[3140.34 --> 3140.52]  in
[3140.52 --> 3140.68]  sin
[3140.68 --> 3140.96]  here
[3140.96 --> 3141.48]  it's
[3141.48 --> 3141.68]  not
[3141.68 --> 3141.84]  just
[3141.84 --> 3142.00]  that
[3142.00 --> 3142.14]  our
[3142.14 --> 3142.58]  desires
[3142.58 --> 3142.76]  are
[3142.76 --> 3143.40]  disordered
[3143.40 --> 3144.98]  but
[3144.98 --> 3145.12]  it's
[3145.12 --> 3145.38]  also
[3145.38 --> 3145.72]  that
[3145.72 --> 3146.32]  we
[3146.32 --> 3146.48]  are
[3146.48 --> 3147.24]  disobedient
[3147.24 --> 3149.00]  that
[3149.00 --> 3149.14]  is

[3149.28 --> 3149.60]  say
[3149.60 --> 3150.14]  we
[3150.14 --> 3150.58]  live
[3150.58 --> 3151.10]  out
[3156.44 --> 3156.58]  let's
[3156.58 --> 3156.84]  look
[3156.84 --> 3157.22]  back
[3157.22 --> 3157.50]  at
[3157.50 --> 3157.72]  verses

[3158.24 --> 3158.36]  of
[3158.36 --> 3158.44]  our
[3158.44 --> 3158.90]  passage
[3158.90 --> 3159.74]  it
[3159.74 --> 3160.16]  says
[3160.16 --> 3160.88]  you
[3160.88 --> 3161.02]  were
[3161.02 --> 3161.40]  dead

[3162.28 --> 3162.48]  and
[3162.48 --> 3162.76]  sins
[3162.76 --> 3162.94]  in
[3162.94 --> 3163.12]  which
[3163.12 --> 3163.28]  you
[3163.28 --> 3163.48]  used
[3163.48 --> 3163.68]  to
[3163.68 --> 3164.12]  live
[3164.12 --> 3164.28]  when
[3164.28 --> 3164.38]  you
[3164.38 --> 3164.86]  followed
[3164.86 --> 3165.12]  the
[3165.12 --> 3165.38]  ways
[3165.38 --> 3165.50]  of
[3165.50 --> 3165.66]  this

[3169.20 --> 3169.40]  who
[3169.40 --> 3169.60]  is
[3169.60 --> 3169.90]  now
[3169.90 --> 3170.26]  at
[3170.26 --> 3170.54]  work
[3170.54 --> 3170.80]  in
[3170.80 --> 3171.08]  those
[3171.08 --> 3171.26]  who
[3171.26 --> 3171.50]  are
[3171.50 --> 3172.30]  disobedient
[3172.30 --> 3174.22]  Paul
[3174.22 --> 3174.66]  saying
[3174.66 --> 3175.60]  we
[3175.60 --> 3175.82]  are
[3175.82 --> 3176.02]  not
[3176.02 --> 3176.38]  interested
[3176.38 --> 3176.60]  in
[3176.60 --> 3176.74]  the
[3176.74 --> 3177.16]  truth
[3177.16 --> 3178.10]  of
[3178.10 --> 3178.50]  God
[3178.50 --> 3179.12]  or
[3179.12 --> 3179.34]  the

[3179.68 --> 3179.90]  of
[3179.90 --> 3180.22]  God
[3180.22 --> 3181.52]  instead
[3181.52 --> 3183.40]  in
[3183.40 --> 3183.58]  our
[3183.58 --> 3184.60]  disobedience
[3184.60 --> 3184.80]  to
[3184.80 --> 3185.12]  God
[3185.12 --> 3185.30]  we
[3185.30 --> 3185.46]  are
[3185.46 --> 3185.82]  following
[3185.82 --> 3186.02]  the
[3186.02 --> 3186.26]  ways
[3186.26 --> 3186.38]  of
[3186.38 --> 3186.52]  the
[3186.52 --> 3186.84]  world
[3186.84 --> 3187.02]  and
[3187.02 --> 3187.16]  of
[3187.16 --> 3187.52]  demons
[3187.52 --> 3188.10]  that's
[3188.10 --> 3188.16]  what
[3188.16 --> 3188.24]  he
[3188.24 --> 3188.42]  says
[3188.42 --> 3188.68]  there
[3188.68 --> 3191.18]  and
[3191.18 --> 3191.32]  it
[3191.32 --> 3191.56]  says
[3191.56 --> 3191.74]  it
[3191.74 --> 3191.92]  uses
[3191.92 --> 3192.20]  the
[3192.20 --> 3192.44]  word
[3192.44 --> 3193.30]  followed
[3193.30 --> 3194.50]  you
[3194.50 --> 3194.58]  know
[3194.58 --> 3194.68]  when
[3194.68 --> 3194.76]  we
[3194.76 --> 3194.88]  think
[3194.88 --> 3195.04]  about
[3195.04 --> 3195.54]  followed
[3195.54 --> 3195.82]  it's
[3195.82 --> 3196.02]  very
[3196.02 --> 3196.54]  passive
[3196.54 --> 3197.10]  I
[3197.10 --> 3197.18]  mean
[3197.18 --> 3197.34]  we're
[3197.34 --> 3197.66]  following
[3197.66 --> 3197.92]  but
[3197.92 --> 3198.08]  it's
[3198.08 --> 3198.28]  not
[3198.28 --> 3199.20]  like
[3199.20 --> 3199.40]  we're
[3199.40 --> 3199.64]  it's
[3199.64 --> 3199.84]  that
[3199.84 --> 3200.18]  active
[3200.18 --> 3201.20]  but
[3201.20 --> 3201.38]  it's
[3201.38 --> 3201.56]  really
[3201.56 --> 3201.78]  kind
[3201.78 --> 3201.84]  of
[3201.84 --> 3201.96]  a
[3201.96 --> 3202.16]  weak
[3202.16 --> 3202.52]  word
[3202.52 --> 3202.70]  in
[3202.70 --> 3202.86]  the
[3202.86 --> 3203.16]  Greek
[3203.16 --> 3203.44]  it's
[3203.44 --> 3203.62]  much
[3203.62 --> 3204.08]  stronger
[3204.08 --> 3204.30]  it
[3204.30 --> 3204.50]  means
[3204.50 --> 3204.66]  we
[3204.66 --> 3204.82]  were
[3204.82 --> 3205.46]  enslaved
[3210.22 --> 3210.64]  pastors
[3210.64 --> 3213.18]  and
[3213.18 --> 3213.28]  the
[3213.28 --> 3213.64]  important
[3213.64 --> 3214.02]  part
[3214.02 --> 3214.32]  here
[3214.32 --> 3214.54]  is
[3214.54 --> 3214.76]  that
[3214.76 --> 3215.18]  sin
[3215.18 --> 3215.40]  is
[3215.40 --> 3215.66]  not
[3215.66 --> 3215.86]  just
[3215.86 --> 3216.12]  something
[3216.12 --> 3216.38]  that's
[3216.38 --> 3216.64]  inside
[3216.64 --> 3216.80]  of
[3216.80 --> 3217.08]  us
[3217.08 --> 3218.58]  it's
[3218.58 --> 3218.70]  not
[3218.70 --> 3218.82]  just
[3218.82 --> 3219.04]  something
[3219.04 --> 3219.36]  inside
[3219.36 --> 3219.52]  of
[3219.52 --> 3219.68]  us
[3219.68 --> 3220.54]  in
[3220.54 --> 3220.70]  our
[3220.70 --> 3221.20]  disordered
[3221.20 --> 3221.68]  desires
[3221.68 --> 3222.04]  it's
[3222.04 --> 3222.32]  actually
[3222.32 --> 3222.62]  something
[3222.62 --> 3223.06]  that we
[3223.06 --> 3223.30]  then
[3223.30 --> 3223.98]  extend
[3223.98 --> 3224.52]  into
[3224.52 --> 3224.78]  the
[3224.78 --> 3225.16]  world
[3225.16 --> 3226.80]  but
[3226.80 --> 3226.96]  let's
[3226.96 --> 3227.30]  remember
[3227.30 --> 3227.54]  what
[3227.54 --> 3227.70]  the

[3242.88 --> 3243.10]  part
[3243.10 --> 3243.20]  of

[3393.02 --> 3393.22]  yet
[3393.22 --> 3393.44]  this
[3393.44 --> 3393.62]  can
[3393.62 --> 3393.78]  make
[3393.78 --> 3393.88]  it
[3393.88 --> 3394.04]  very
[3394.04 --> 3394.44]  confusing
[3394.44 --> 3394.72]  for
[3394.72 --> 3395.04]  us
[3395.04 --> 3395.62]  when
[3395.62 --> 3395.74]  we
[3395.74 --> 3395.90]  talk

[3396.36 --> 3396.68]  judgment
[3396.68 --> 3397.58]  right
[3397.58 --> 3397.94]  because
[3397.94 --> 3398.68]  we like
[3398.68 --> 3399.00]  to talk
[3399.00 --> 3399.16]  about
[3399.16 --> 3399.32]  the
[3399.32 --> 3399.54]  love
[3399.54 --> 3399.90]  part
[3399.90 --> 3400.14]  but
[3400.14 --> 3400.86]  the
[3400.86 --> 3401.20]  judgment
[3401.20 --> 3401.42]  of
[3401.42 --> 3401.56]  God
[3401.56 --> 3401.72]  the
[3401.72 --> 3401.96]  wrath
[3401.96 --> 3402.10]  of
[3402.10 --> 3402.44]  God
[3402.44 --> 3403.10]  that
[3403.10 --> 3403.32]  makes
[3403.32 --> 3403.66]  us
[3403.66 --> 3404.40]  uncomfortable
[3404.40 --> 3405.60]  but
[3405.60 --> 3405.76]  the
[3405.76 --> 3406.02]  Bible
[3406.02 --> 3406.56]  insists
[3406.56 --> 3406.92]  on

[3409.36 --> 3409.70]  judgment
[3409.70 --> 3410.02]  go
[3410.02 --> 3410.44]  together
[3410.44 --> 3411.54]  right
[3411.54 --> 3411.70]  that
[3411.70 --> 3411.96]  love
[3411.96 --> 3412.14]  and
[3412.14 --> 3412.44]  judgment
[3412.44 --> 3413.08]  have

[3413.28 --> 3413.52]  go
[3413.52 --> 3413.96]  together
[3413.96 --> 3414.70]  and
[3414.70 --> 3414.98]  here's
[3414.98 --> 3415.26]  why
[3415.26 --> 3416.88]  remember
[3416.88 --> 3417.20]  God
[3417.20 --> 3417.58]  made
[3417.58 --> 3417.82]  the
[3417.82 --> 3418.04]  world
[3418.04 --> 3418.42]  good
[3418.42 --> 3419.02]  God
[3419.02 --> 3419.32]  made
[3419.32 --> 3419.50]  this
[3419.50 --> 3419.78]  world
[3419.78 --> 3419.94]  he
[3419.94 --> 3420.18]  called
[3420.18 --> 3420.30]  it
[3420.30 --> 3420.48]  good
[3420.48 --> 3420.62]  he
[3420.62 --> 3420.82]  made
[3420.82 --> 3420.90]  it
[3420.90 --> 3421.02]  in
[3421.02 --> 3421.54]  wholeness
[3421.54 --> 3421.66]  it
[3421.66 --> 3421.76]  was
[3421.76 --> 3422.08]  beautiful
[3422.08 --> 3422.28]  and
[3422.28 --> 3422.66]  perfect
[3422.66 --> 3423.28]  it
[3423.28 --> 3423.38]  was
[3423.38 --> 3423.96]  expression
[3423.96 --> 3424.28]  of
[3424.28 --> 3424.52]  his
[3424.52 --> 3424.80]  own
[3424.80 --> 3425.28]  goodness
[3425.28 --> 3425.78]  his

[3426.10 --> 3426.74]  wholeness
[3426.74 --> 3427.48]  reflected
[3427.48 --> 3427.88]  into
[3427.88 --> 3428.08]  the
[3428.08 --> 3428.54]  creation
[3428.54 --> 3429.76]  but
[3429.76 --> 3429.94]  when
[3429.94 --> 3430.14]  we
[3430.14 --> 3430.86]  sinned
[3430.86 --> 3431.68]  we
[3431.68 --> 3432.94]  divided
[3432.94 --> 3433.60]  ourselves
[3433.60 --> 3434.10]  from
[3434.10 --> 3434.58]  God
[3434.58 --> 3435.44]  we

[3440.50 --> 3440.92]  and
[3440.92 --> 3441.10]  there was
[3441.10 --> 3441.48]  division
[3441.48 --> 3441.96]  everywhere
[3441.96 --> 3442.80]  not
[3442.80 --> 3443.26]  wholeness

[3534.60 --> 3535.46]  confronted
[3535.46 --> 3535.78]  him
[3535.78 --> 3535.92]  in
[3535.92 --> 3536.28]  public
[3536.28 --> 3536.74]  and
[3536.74 --> 3536.98]  made
[3536.98 --> 3537.18]  him
[3537.18 --> 3537.42]  a
[3537.42 --> 3537.92]  prisoner
[3537.92 --> 3538.22]  and
[3538.22 --> 3538.58]  Paul
[3538.58 --> 3539.64]  called
[3539.64 --> 3540.00]  himself
[3540.00 --> 3540.20]  a
[3540.20 --> 3540.58]  prisoner
[3540.58 --> 3540.90]  of
[3540.90 --> 3541.06]  the
[3541.06 --> 3541.34]  Lord
[3541.34 --> 3541.54]  for
[3541.54 --> 3541.64]  the
[3541.64 --> 3541.80]  rest
[3541.80 --> 3541.92]  of
[3541.92 --> 3542.04]  his
[3542.04 --> 3542.36]  life
[3542.36 --> 3543.48]  right
[3543.48 --> 3543.76]  Paul
[3543.76 --> 3544.20]  knows
[3544.20 --> 3544.68]  judgment
[3544.68 --> 3545.16]  Paul
[3545.16 --> 3545.56]  was
[3545.56 --> 3546.28]  judged
[3546.28 --> 3546.50]  by
[3546.50 --> 3546.86]  God
[3546.86 --> 3547.64]  and
[3547.64 --> 3547.86]  he's
[3547.86 --> 3548.18]  writing
[3548.18 --> 3548.52]  to
[3548.52 --> 3548.76]  the
[3548.76 --> 3549.04]  church
[3549.04 --> 3549.64]  about
[3549.64 --> 3550.00]  the
[3550.00 --> 3550.30]  judgment
[3550.30 --> 3550.56]  that
[3550.56 --> 3550.72]  we
[3550.72 --> 3550.88]  were
[3550.88 --> 3551.22]  all
[3551.22 --> 3551.78]  under
[3551.78 --> 3552.54]  he
[3552.54 --> 3552.76]  says
[3552.76 --> 3553.06]  because
[3553.06 --> 3553.38]  of
[3553.38 --> 3553.56]  our
[3553.56 --> 3553.86]  sin
[3553.86 --> 3554.30]  we
[3554.30 --> 3554.90]  deserve
[3554.90 --> 3555.46]  judgment
[3555.46 --> 3556.90]  and
[3556.90 --> 3557.16]  judgment
[3557.16 --> 3557.34]  is
[3557.34 --> 3557.68]  hard
[3557.68 --> 3558.54]  because
[3558.54 --> 3558.82]  sin
[3558.82 --> 3558.98]  is
[3558.98 --> 3559.26]  hard
[3559.26 --> 3560.64]  and
[3560.64 --> 3560.78]  the
[3560.78 --> 3560.96]  world
[3560.96 --> 3561.10]  that
[3561.10 --> 3561.26]  God
[3561.26 --> 3561.66]  made
[3561.66 --> 3562.28]  matters
[3562.28 --> 3562.50]  too
[3562.50 --> 3562.86]  much
[3562.86 --> 3563.20]  for
[3563.20 --> 3563.54]  judgment
[3563.54 --> 3564.26]  not
[3564.26 --> 3564.50]  to
[3564.50 --> 3564.72]  be
[3564.72 --> 3565.10]  hard
[3565.10 --> 3568.10]  but
[3568.10 --> 3568.22]  the
[3568.22 --> 3568.42]  Bible
[3568.42 --> 3568.74]  also
[3568.74 --> 3568.98]  says
[3568.98 --> 3569.16]  if
[3569.16 --> 3569.32]  we
[3569.32 --> 3569.68]  confess
[3569.68 --> 3570.02]  that
[3570.02 --> 3570.18]  we
[3570.18 --> 3570.62]  deserve
[3570.62 --> 3571.16]  judgment
[3571.16 --> 3572.30]  as
[3572.30 --> 3572.42]  the
[3572.42 --> 3572.70]  apostle
[3572.70 --> 3573.06]  John
[3573.06 --> 3573.36]  says
[3573.36 --> 3573.62]  God
[3573.62 --> 3573.78]  is
[3573.78 --> 3574.00]  both
[3574.00 --> 3574.38]  faithful
[3574.38 --> 3574.88]  and
[3574.88 --> 3575.78]  just
[3575.78 --> 3576.78]  to
[3576.78 --> 3577.12]  forgive
[3577.12 --> 3577.34]  us
[3577.34 --> 3577.46]  of
[3577.46 --> 3577.62]  our
[3577.62 --> 3577.84]  sins
[3577.84 --> 3578.02]  and
[3578.02 --> 3578.30]  cleanse
[3578.30 --> 3578.50]  us
[3578.50 --> 3578.68]  of
[3578.68 --> 3578.90]  all
[3578.90 --> 3579.62]  unrighteousness
[3579.62 --> 3580.10]  because
[3580.10 --> 3580.34]  of
[3580.34 --> 3580.44]  the
[3580.88 --> 3581.02]  Jesus
[3581.02 --> 3581.44]  Christ
[3581.44 --> 3582.00]  who
[3582.00 --> 3582.30]  died
[3582.30 --> 3582.48]  in
[3582.48 --> 3582.62]  our
[3582.62 --> 3583.08]  place
[3583.08 --> 3584.88]  so
[3584.88 --> 3585.12]  on
[3585.12 --> 3586.14]  Jesus
[3586.14 --> 3586.74]  Jesus
[3586.74 --> 3587.22]  got
[3587.22 --> 3588.06]  judgment
[3588.06 --> 3590.58]  and
[3590.58 --> 3590.72]  we
[3590.72 --> 3590.88]  got
[3590.88 --> 3591.24]  mercy
[3591.24 --> 3592.26]  we
[3592.26 --> 3592.42]  got
[3592.42 --> 3592.54]  what
[3592.54 --> 3592.76]  we
[3592.76 --> 3593.02]  don't
[3593.02 --> 3593.48]  deserve
[3593.48 --> 3596.06]  so
[3596.06 --> 3596.24]  as
[3596.24 --> 3596.38]  we
[3596.38 --> 3596.74]  conclude
[3596.74 --> 3596.96]  here
[3596.96 --> 3597.08]  I
[3597.08 --> 3597.20]  want
[3597.20 --> 3597.32]  us
[3597.32 --> 3597.44]  to
[3597.44 --> 3597.64]  think
[3597.64 --> 3597.82]  about
[3597.82 --> 3597.98]  some
[3597.98 --> 3598.48]  application
[3598.48 --> 3600.98]  why
[3600.98 --> 3601.18]  did
[3601.18 --> 3601.44]  Paul
[3601.44 --> 3601.74]  write
[3601.74 --> 3602.18]  this
[3602.18 --> 3604.12]  right
[3604.12 --> 3604.26]  why
[3604.26 --> 3604.38]  did
[3604.38 --> 3604.46]  he
[3604.46 --> 3604.70]  write
[3604.70 --> 3605.06]  this
[3605.06 --> 3607.18]  does
[3607.18 --> 3607.38]  he
[3607.38 --> 3607.80]  want
[3607.80 --> 3608.32]  us
[3608.32 --> 3608.48]  to
[3608.48 --> 3609.06]  understand
[3609.06 --> 3609.24]  the
[3609.24 --> 3609.68]  doctrines
[3609.68 --> 3609.86]  of
[3609.86 --> 3610.10]  sin
[3610.10 --> 3610.26]  and
[3610.26 --> 3610.70]  salvation
[3610.70 --> 3611.92]  well
[3611.92 --> 3612.10]  yeah
[3612.10 --> 3612.28]  I
[3612.28 --> 3612.44]  think
[3612.44 --> 3612.90]  he
[3612.90 --> 3613.24]  does
[3613.24 --> 3613.40]  he
[3613.40 --> 3613.62]  wants
[3613.62 --> 3613.76]  us
[3613.76 --> 3613.84]  to
[3613.84 --> 3614.20]  understand
[3614.20 --> 3614.42]  these
[3614.42 --> 3614.70]  things
[3614.70 --> 3615.08]  but
[3615.08 --> 3615.20]  I
[3615.20 --> 3615.38]  don't
[3615.38 --> 3615.56]  think
[3615.56 --> 3615.72]  that's
[3615.72 --> 3615.86]  the
[3615.86 --> 3616.34]  primary
[3616.34 --> 3617.04]  reason
[3617.04 --> 3617.82]  why
[3617.82 --> 3618.18]  Paul
[3618.18 --> 3618.62]  wrote
[3618.62 --> 3618.96]  these
[3618.96 --> 3619.32]  verses
[3619.32 --> 3620.86]  because
[3620.86 --> 3621.20]  as
[3621.20 --> 3621.34]  we
[3621.34 --> 3621.48]  will
[3621.48 --> 3621.70]  see
[3621.70 --> 3622.06]  later
[3622.06 --> 3622.38]  on
[3622.38 --> 3622.52]  in
[3622.52 --> 3622.80]  chapter

[3624.98 --> 3625.34]  about
[3625.34 --> 3625.64]  what
[3625.64 --> 3625.84]  we
[3625.84 --> 3626.20]  were
[3626.20 --> 3626.40]  that
[3626.40 --> 3626.50]  we
[3626.50 --> 3626.62]  were
[3626.62 --> 3626.82]  all
[3626.82 --> 3627.02]  dead
[3627.02 --> 3627.22]  in
[3627.22 --> 3627.56]  sin
[3627.56 --> 3628.28]  to
[3628.28 --> 3628.64]  help
[3628.64 --> 3628.80]  us
[3628.80 --> 3628.98]  to
[3628.98 --> 3629.18]  live
[3629.18 --> 3629.52]  together
[3629.52 --> 3629.74]  as
[3629.74 --> 3629.88]  the
[3629.88 --> 3630.26]  church
[3630.26 --> 3630.74]  that'll
[3630.74 --> 3630.96]  become
[3630.96 --> 3631.40]  clearer
[3631.40 --> 3631.72]  later
[3631.72 --> 3632.06]  on

[3634.54 --> 3634.98]  church
[3634.98 --> 3636.76]  so

[3642.30 --> 3642.50]  writing
[3642.50 --> 3642.64]  to
[3642.64 --> 3642.76]  us
[3642.76 --> 3642.96]  about
[3642.96 --> 3643.14]  how
[3643.14 --> 3643.22]  we
[3643.22 --> 3643.34]  were
[3643.34 --> 3643.60]  all
[3643.60 --> 3643.88]  dead

[3646.28 --> 3646.48]  he's
[3646.48 --> 3646.62]  saying
[3646.62 --> 3646.76]  that
[3646.76 --> 3646.90]  for

[3649.60 --> 3649.88]  deeper
[3649.88 --> 3650.28]  truth
[3650.28 --> 3650.50]  is
[3650.50 --> 3650.68]  that
[3650.68 --> 3650.92]  we
[3650.92 --> 3651.34]  all
[3651.34 --> 3651.60]  are
[3651.60 --> 3652.20]  judged

[3653.42 --> 3653.76]  our
[3653.76 --> 3654.38]  judge
[3654.38 --> 3655.10]  is
[3655.10 --> 3655.50]  God

[4243.30 --> 4250.30]  Our God and our Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for this beautiful world that you have.
[4250.30 --> 4260.30]  That when we look around, we can be reminded of your power and your majesty, your might and your goodness.
[4260.30 --> 4271.30]  Lord, help us to have not just a small view of who you are, but Lord, have a biblical view, a large view, that you are the God, our Creator.
[4271.30 --> 4279.30]  But we also thank you, Lord, that even though you are immense, that you rule this entire world, Lord, according to your goodness and love.
[4279.30 --> 4283.30]  Yet, you are mindful of us.
[4283.30 --> 4287.30]  You are close to those who are brokenhearted.
[4287.30 --> 4291.30]  You care about each life that you've created.
[4291.30 --> 4301.30]  You care about each little congregation all over the world that you've brought together to be your people, to know and to worship you.
[4301.30 --> 4307.30]  Lord, we thank you for your care over us and our lives.
[4307.30 --> 4323.30]  And so, Father, because of your great mercy by which you have adopted us to be your sons and daughters, and you have become our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege to respond to you.
[4323.30 --> 4325.30]  Because you have softened our hearts.
[4325.30 --> 4326.30]  Because you have softened our hearts.
[4326.30 --> 4329.30]  You have made us responsive to the Gospel.
[4329.30 --> 4331.30]  Father, we don't take that for granted.
[4331.30 --> 4338.30]  So, Father, we come before you as our King and our God, and also as our Heavenly Father.
[4338.30 --> 4345.30]  And we pour out to you those things in our hearts, Lord, that trouble us.
[4345.30 --> 4348.30]  Those things that we need help with.
[4348.30 --> 4356.30]  Father, we especially this morning, we just want to think about the needs of our own congregation.
[4356.30 --> 4363.30]  Lord, first of all, we thank you for the birth of little Steven Parker to Mike and Marion.
[4363.30 --> 4366.30]  Lord, we thank you for this new child.
[4366.30 --> 4372.30]  We pray that you would continue to help Mike and Marion to welcome a new child into their family.
[4372.30 --> 4373.30]  Help also.
[4373.30 --> 4375.30]  We pray for Peter and Natalie.
[4375.30 --> 4380.30]  Lord, would you also just give little Steven good health?
[4380.30 --> 4383.30]  Help Marion to recover well.
[4383.30 --> 4392.30]  Lord, in a similar way, we pray for a Sif away and Emmanuel as they're expecting their child very soon in the middle of July.
[4392.30 --> 4396.30]  Lord, would you just continue to be with a Sif away as she nears the end of her pregnancy.
[4396.30 --> 4398.30]  Be with them as a family.
[4398.30 --> 4402.30]  Strengthen them in love for one another and for you.
[4402.30 --> 4405.30]  For graciousness, Lord, to one another.
[4405.30 --> 4415.30]  And because having a baby is a joy, but also, Lord, can create some new challenges.
[4415.30 --> 4418.30]  So, Lord, would you have mercy on both of these families.
[4418.30 --> 4420.30]  And, Lord, we think about those who are sick.
[4420.30 --> 4430.30]  We especially, Lord, continue to pray for little Richie who is still facing more treatments, more health issues.
[4430.30 --> 4433.30]  Lord, would you have mercy on him?
[4433.30 --> 4443.30]  Would you rescue him physically, Lord, so that you can also, Lord, rescue him?
[4443.30 --> 4446.30]  And we thank you that you have, Lord, rescued him spiritually.
[4446.30 --> 4452.30]  Lord, would you also be with Janet as she is back in the hospital for a bit, nothing too serious.
[4452.30 --> 4454.30]  But, Lord, she wants to return home.
[4454.30 --> 4458.30]  Help her to be healed of all the remaining medical issues that she is facing.
[4458.30 --> 4465.30]  And, Lord, we also pray for Angela and Perry, for Lorna and the loss of Angela's dad.
[4465.30 --> 4471.30]  Lord, we thank you for a good church community where they, where her dad was from.
[4471.30 --> 4477.30]  For the pastor there who is willing to serve and to officiate this memorial service.
[4477.30 --> 4483.30]  Lord, we pray that it would be a time, Lord, to remember your goodness and graciousness.
[4483.30 --> 4485.30]  And the life that you've given to Angela's dad, Lord.
[4485.30 --> 4492.30]  But would you comfort Angela in this time of sorrow and all the family, Lord, who mourn.
[4492.30 --> 4502.30]  Lord, we thank you again that you care for each one of us and that not a hair can fall from our heads without the will of our Father in heaven.
[4502.30 --> 4509.30]  And so, Lord, we look to you, to your strength and to your might, to your goodness and your love as your children.
[4509.30 --> 4513.30]  And we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4513.30 --> 4519.30]  Please rise and receive these words of blessing and benediction.
[4519.30 --> 4527.30]  May God our Father bless you.
[4527.30 --> 4531.30]  Jesus Christ, by his grace, save you.
[4531.30 --> 4536.30]  And the Holy Spirit, enliven you to know him, to love him, to follow him.
[4536.30 --> 4540.30]  In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
[4549.30 --> 4563.30]  Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[4563.30 --> 4572.30]  Praise him, all creatures here below.
[4572.30 --> 4582.30]  Praise him above, ye heavenly hosts.
[4582.30 --> 4597.30]  Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.
[4597.30 --> 4599.30]  Amen.
[4599.30 --> 4600.30]  Amen.
[4600.30 --> 4601.30]  Amen.
[4601.30 --> 4602.60]  Amen.
