[718.48 → 719.48] All right.
[719.48 → 721.48] And it sounds like you've done this before in the church.

[976.44 → 978.52] the power to say

[1095.56 → 1102.44] but your name
[1104.44 → 1116.44] is
[1117.80 → 1123.96] as a denomination we have designated the fourth Sunday in September abuse awareness Sunday
[1124.68 → 1130.28] it's an opportunity to recognize an important issue that we as individuals and as part of the
[1130.28 → 1136.84] body of Christ have in the past failed to properly address or simply were unsure how to take action
[1137.72 → 1143.40] we've kept silent when we should have spoken out we have kept at a distance when we should have
[1143.40 → 1150.60] stepped in to comfort and walk alongside with this in mind our call to confession comes from Isaiah 30
[1150.60 → 1158.44] this is what the sovereign lord the holy one of Israel says in repentance and rest is your salvation
[1159.16 → 1165.24] in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it yet the lord longs to be
[1165.24 → 1171.40] gracious to you therefore he will rise up to show you compassion for the lord is a god of justice
[1171.40 → 1179.64] blessed are all who wait for him please bow your heads with me as I pray almighty god we confess how
[1179.64 → 1186.60] hard it is to be your people you have called us to be the church to continue the mission of Jesus Christ
[1186.60 → 1194.12] to our lonely and confused world, yet we acknowledge we are more apathetic than active isolated than
[1194.12 → 1203.24] involved callous than compassionate obstinate than obedient legalistic than loving gracious lord have
[1203.24 → 1209.96] mercy upon us and forgive our sins remove the obstacles preventing us from being your representatives to

[1227.40 → 1234.52] are assured that there is no sin so terrible that god can forgive no hurt so terrible that god cannot heal

[1246.92 → 1250.76] god bless you
[1250.76 → 1257.40] this next song was introduced in the summer and has wonderful words of encouragement for any time but
[1257.40 → 1269.40] especially with the prayer and the focus that Ashley has presented and let's enjoy this song and the words of it this morning

[1529.80 → 1531.72] oh
[1531.72 → 1533.72] oh
[1533.72 → 1534.72] oh
[1534.72 → 1539.72] but through Christ in me.
[1539.72 → 1546.72] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1546.72 → 1565.72] The kids are dismissed for children's worship.
[1576.72 → 1594.72] Well, good morning everyone.
[1594.72 → 1601.72] It's great to worship with you and the singing was just lovely this morning.
[1601.72 → 1604.72] So praise be to God.
[1604.72 → 1610.72] Before we read the passage today, I wanted to take a moment to kind of orient us.
[1610.72 → 1614.72] So where are we in this kind of long series that we're in, in the book of Ephesians?
[1614.72 → 1619.72] And so to help us think about that, I want you to think about travelling.
[1619.72 → 1623.72] I love to travel, as I'm sure many of you do as well.
[1623.72 → 1628.72] So imagine with me that you are flying to visit a new place.
[1628.72 → 1631.72] You know, somewhere maybe you've never been before.
[1631.72 → 1635.72] And maybe you're lucky enough to get a window seat.
[1635.72 → 1641.72] And as you're flying, you look through the window, and you see the beautiful skyline of this city that you've heard so much about.
[1641.72 → 1646.72] And you've seen pictures of, but now you get to finally see it for yourself.
[1646.72 → 1649.72] And so you take out your phone, and you take a photo.
[1649.72 → 1656.72] You know, it's got that kind of iconic, you know, airplane wing, you know, with the skyline of the city behind it.
[1656.72 → 1657.72] It's a beautiful shot.
[1657.72 → 1662.72] And then you land on the ground, and maybe you take a taxi to your hotel.
[1662.72 → 1668.72] And for the first time, you begin to take in some of the new sights and sounds and smells.
[1668.72 → 1673.72] You sense the heat or the coldness or whatever the environment is.
[1673.72 → 1678.72] And you start to get a sense of what life on the ground in that city looks like.
[1678.72 → 1685.72] And then maybe, you know, you've unpacked your bags, you've gotten settled a bit, and you head out on the street.
[1685.72 → 1689.72] And you visit all those places that you've Googled and that you've been looking forward to seeing.
[1689.72 → 1697.72] You know, you find those restaurants in those small alleys, and you visit all these special sites that you've wanted to explore.
[1697.72 → 1702.72] Now, the book of Ephesians is a little similar to this.
[1702.72 → 1708.72] The first half of the letter is really chapters one through three, and it is up in the sky.
[1708.72 → 1717.72] It is super cosmic, big themes, and it's focusing on the unity that we have with God and with one another in Jesus Christ.
[1717.72 → 1722.72] Right? That's the airplane window, high up view.
[1722.72 → 1727.72] You know, God has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and all these things.
[1727.72 → 1736.72] But then the second half of the book, in chapters really kind of four through six, is where we touch down on the ground.
[1736.72 → 1744.72] And we get to see firsthand what this unity with others looks like on the street level.
[1744.72 → 1749.72] Right? In the real relationships of life that we are all in.
[1749.72 → 1754.72] Because it's one thing to talk about the unity of the church, and it's another thing to be in the church.
[1754.72 → 1758.72] And to work that out in real life.
[1758.72 → 1761.72] And so the second half of the book is very practical.
[1761.72 → 1764.72] It's about the practices of unity.
[1764.72 → 1767.72] And that's where we are right now.
[1767.72 → 1771.72] Okay? This is our third week in the second half of the letter.
[1771.72 → 1774.72] So now let's read the passage this morning.
[1774.72 → 1776.72] It's Ephesians chapter 4.
[1776.72 → 1781.72] And we'll read verses 25 through chapter 5 verse 2.
[1781.72 → 1787.72] So please give your attention to the reading of God's word while I read it for us.
[1787.72 → 1797.72] You are taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires,
[1797.72 → 1806.72] to be made new in the attitude of your mind, and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[1806.72 → 1814.72] Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbour.
[1814.72 → 1816.72] For we are all members of one body.
[1816.72 → 1818.72] In your anger, do not sin.
[1818.72 → 1821.72] Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.
[1821.72 → 1824.72] And do not give the devil a foothold.
[1824.72 → 1831.72] Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their hands,
[1831.72 → 1835.72] that they may have something to share with those in need.
[1835.72 → 1840.72] Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful,
[1840.72 → 1845.72] for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
[1845.72 → 1852.72] And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[1852.72 → 1858.72] Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander.
[1858.72 → 1867.72] Along with every form of malice, be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you.
[1867.72 → 1879.72] Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children, and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us,
[1879.72 → 1883.72] as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[1883.72 → 1885.72] This is the word of the Lord.
[1885.72 → 1886.72] Amen.
[1886.72 → 1888.72] Let's pray.
[1888.72 → 1892.72] Our Father, we come before your word this morning.
[1892.72 → 1893.72] We thank you for it.
[1893.72 → 1903.72] We thank you for the truth, the beauty, the light that it reveals about who you are and who you call us to be.
[1903.72 → 1913.72] So, Father, would you do your work in our hearts now by the work of your Holy Spirit, opening our ears, our eyes, our minds, our hearts,
[1913.72 → 1918.72] or that we might be your faithful followers.
[1918.72 → 1919.72] We pray in Jesus name.
[1919.72 → 1920.72] Amen.
[1920.72 → 1927.72] So now, earlier in chapter 4, Paul began talking about unity.
[1927.72 → 1934.72] He says, you've been called to one Lord, to one faith, to one baptism.
[1934.72 → 1943.72] And the main emphasis of the book of Ephesians is this, how the gospel unites people from all these different places.
[1943.72 → 1951.72] He unites people who are different from one another, especially those who before had actually been hostile to one another.
[1951.72 → 1957.72] And exhibit A for this is the Jews and the Gentiles.
[1957.72 → 1964.72] Chapter 2 talked about this dividing wall of hostility that historically had been between the Jews and the Gentiles.
[1964.72 → 1969.72] But that now how it has been torn down through the cross of Jesus.
[1969.72 → 1980.72] And so historically, the Jews and the Gentiles had been hostile to one another along ethnic lines, their cultures and their language.
[1980.72 → 1984.72] They had been hostile to each other religiously along moral lines.
[1984.72 → 1989.72] Their traditions, their sensibilities were often in contrast to one another.
[1989.72 → 1995.72] And yet, here we have Jesus calling them to be together as family.
[1995.72 → 1996.72] Right?
[1996.72 → 1999.72] Kind of like a blended family in a sense.
[1999.72 → 2011.72] But because of this historical dynamic of differences between the two groups, things like, Paul says here, bitterness, anger, slander, malice.
[2011.72 → 2020.72] All of these things are on the tips of people's tongues in this blended community as they learn how to live together as the church.
[2020.72 → 2034.72] And yet, positively, what this represents is Jews and Gentiles coming and living together as one family is actually an opportunity for the people of Jesus to demonstrate in their life together the logic of grace.
[2034.72 → 2037.72] And the logic of grace is this.
[2037.72 → 2042.72] Because Christ has forgiven us, so we forgive one another.
[2042.72 → 2043.72] Right?
[2043.72 → 2047.72] As Christ has loved us, so we are to love one another.
[2047.72 → 2058.72] Because Christ pursued us, not when we were his friends, but actually when we were his enemies, so we pursue one another.
[2058.72 → 2062.72] The Reformed biblical scholar D.A. Carson put it this way.
[2062.72 → 2066.72] We'll have a quote up here.
[2066.72 → 2067.72] It says,
[2067.72 → 2075.72] Christians are a natural band of enemies who love one another now for Jesus' sake.
[2075.72 → 2076.72] Right?
[2076.72 → 2077.72] That's the image of the church.
[2077.72 → 2080.72] What he means there is that the church, you know, we're not an affinity group.
[2080.72 → 2083.72] You know, we're all not a bunch of people who, you know, love to go skiing together.
[2083.72 → 2086.72] Or we're all just one thing or another.
[2086.72 → 2094.72] But we're a band of people who naturally are not friends, enemies in a sense, but who love one another for Jesus' sake.
[2094.72 → 2095.72] Right?
[2095.72 → 2098.72] That's the image of the church.
[2098.72 → 2099.72] All these different people.
[2099.72 → 2103.72] Things that we wouldn't normally get together, but here we are.
[2103.72 → 2105.72] Here we are together.
[2105.72 → 2107.72] Centred around the gospel.
[2107.72 → 2108.72] Jesus.
[2108.72 → 2111.72] So now the question is, well, how do we do this?
[2111.72 → 2114.72] How do we walk in the way of love?
[2114.72 → 2116.72] As Paul says here.
[2116.72 → 2119.72] Well, as you can guess, he's going to tell us.
[2119.72 → 2127.72] And the way Paul talks about this is he mentions in this passage a bunch of different vices and a bunch of different virtues.
[2127.72 → 2134.72] And what they are is I don't think they're a random list of different vices and virtues.
[2134.72 → 2137.72] Because you look at that, and you might say, well, why does he say this and not that?
[2137.72 → 2138.72] Right?
[2138.72 → 2140.72] Why is he talking about these things and not some other things?
[2140.72 → 2155.72] But the reason he chooses these that he mentions is that they are all illustrations of how we either build community up in the way that we live with one another or how we burn it down.
[2155.72 → 2159.72] So, for instance, in verse 25, Paul says this.
[2159.72 → 2165.72] Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbour.
[2165.72 → 2167.72] But notice why.
[2167.72 → 2169.72] Notice the motivation he gives here.
[2169.72 → 2174.72] He says, for we are all members of one another.
[2174.72 → 2179.72] So that's what is underlying all of these vices and virtues that he lists here.
[2179.72 → 2185.72] They are things that either build community up or actually harm community and burn it down.
[2185.72 → 2188.72] And so we're going to look at this morning in these two ways.
[2188.72 → 2195.72] First, Paul calls us to put off these ways of living that actually burn community down.
[2195.72 → 2202.72] And second, Paul calls us, on the other hand, to learn practices that build community up.
[2202.72 → 2204.72] So let's look at these two things.
[2204.72 → 2214.72] First, let's look at these practices that we are told to put off, to no longer do, get rid of these things in our life together.
[2214.72 → 2219.72] And first is the habit of nursing anger.
[2219.72 → 2221.72] Look here at verse 26.
[2221.72 → 2223.72] In your anger do not sin.
[2223.72 → 2229.72] Now, when he's talking about anger here, he's not talking about the good kind of anger.
[2229.72 → 2231.72] Did you know there's a good kind of anger?
[2231.72 → 2236.72] That's the anger we feel when, about the things that harm the world.
[2236.72 → 2241.72] When things are harming the world or harming people we love, we feel angry.
[2241.72 → 2242.72] Rightly so.
[2242.72 → 2243.72] Right?
[2243.72 → 2246.72] This is because it's anger that's motivated by love.
[2246.72 → 2248.72] God has that kind of anger.
[2248.72 → 2253.72] He wants the church to have that kind of anger, but that's not the anger he's talking about here.
[2253.72 → 2257.72] The anger he's talking about here is resentment.
[2257.72 → 2259.72] This is the bad kind of anger.
[2259.72 → 2270.72] It's bitterness and indignation that you feel, and I feel by some personal slight or personal snub that somebody did to you.
[2270.72 → 2281.72] This is the kind of anger that deliberately nurses grudges and hurts in our hearts, and it stays up late in the night thinking about it and brewing over it.
[2281.72 → 2290.72] And the focus of this anger, when it's not just on the hurt that you've received, it's on the failure of another person because of what they've done.
[2290.72 → 2292.72] And that's what resentment is.
[2292.72 → 2297.72] It's this bitter anger that's entirely focused on the flaws of another person.
[2297.72 → 2302.72] Have you ever had this done to you?
[2302.72 → 2304.72] Well, how does it feel?
[2304.72 → 2306.72] It feels terrible, right?
[2306.72 → 2308.72] And have you ever done this to another person?
[2308.72 → 2311.72] Of course you have.
[2311.72 → 2312.72] I have.
[2312.72 → 2317.72] Now, why is this destructive to community?
[2317.72 → 2324.72] Because what it is, it is refusing to give someone else grace in their failures.
[2324.72 → 2330.72] It's refusing to stop nursing anger so that there can be reconciliation with another person.
[2330.72 → 2333.72] And it absolutely burns community to the ground.
[2333.72 → 2342.72] And I'm guessing some of you here are estranged from people because they have done this to you or that you have done it to them.
[2342.72 → 2346.72] But Paul then adds something to this in verses 26 and 27.
[2346.72 → 2347.72] He says,
[2347.72 → 2353.72] In your anger do not sin, do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.
[2353.72 → 2355.72] And that line struck me.
[2355.72 → 2359.72] Because remember, this is a very practical section, right?
[2359.72 → 2365.72] Paul's talking, he's not talking about the Christ ruling over the principalities and the rulers in the heavenly places.
[2365.72 → 2366.72] Right?
[2366.72 → 2367.72] This cosmic view.
[2367.72 → 2371.72] Rather, this is like really normal stuff he's talking about.
[2371.72 → 2374.72] Just like anger and bitterness that we all kind of struggle with.
[2374.72 → 2378.72] And then here is the devil thrown right into the mix of it.
[2378.72 → 2385.72] And this is a reminder that normal Christian living is spiritual warfare.
[2385.72 → 2388.72] The devil is trying to encourage you to sin.
[2388.72 → 2398.72] And when you're full of bitterness and rage and anger, as Paul talks about here, do you know what the devil loves to do?
[2398.72 → 2399.72] Nothing.
[2399.72 → 2402.72] The devil doesn't want you to do a thing.
[2402.72 → 2407.72] He wants you to sit there and stay mad.
[2407.72 → 2414.72] Because when you stay mad, when you're kind of full of this anger, you don't think you're sinning.
[2414.72 → 2415.72] Right?
[2415.72 → 2417.72] You think it's the other person that's sinning.
[2417.72 → 2419.72] And so you just stay mad.
[2419.72 → 2421.72] And you don't seek reconciliation.
[2421.72 → 2425.72] And that's why Paul says, do not let the sun go down while you are angry.
[2425.72 → 2432.72] Because by doing that, you're doing exactly what the devil wants you to do, which is damage community.
[2432.72 → 2434.72] That's what he loves.
[2434.72 → 2437.72] So Paul says, don't let the sun go down your anger.
[2437.72 → 2439.72] Don't do anything.
[2439.72 → 2442.72] But we'll talk about what you do.
[2442.72 → 2444.72] So that's the first habit that breaks down community.
[2444.72 → 2446.72] It's the habit of nursing anger.
[2446.72 → 2447.72] Now here's the second.
[2447.72 → 2449.72] It's the habit of taking advantage.
[2449.72 → 2451.72] So listen to verse 28.
[2451.72 → 2454.72] Anyone who has been stealing must no longer steal.
[2454.72 → 2457.72] Now, it's not clear exactly what Paul is talking about here.
[2457.72 → 2460.72] What's going on in the church in Ephesus.
[2460.72 → 2464.72] One possibility is that maybe people in the church were actually stealing things from one another.
[2464.72 → 2465.72] Right?
[2465.72 → 2468.72] But Paul doesn't say who they are or what they're stealing.
[2468.72 → 2474.72] Now, can you imagine coming to church and being like, hey, that's my blue jacket.
[2474.72 → 2476.72] What are you doing with my blue jacket?
[2476.72 → 2477.72] Right?
[2477.72 → 2479.72] That'd be kind of awkward.
[2479.72 → 2481.72] Maybe that's what's happening.
[2481.72 → 2488.72] But I think it's more likely that people in the congregation are just simply taking advantage of one another.
[2488.72 → 2492.72] They're presuming on the gifts and the generosity of other people.
[2492.72 → 2496.72] And so in Acts chapter 2, we get this look at the early church community.
[2496.72 → 2497.72] And it says this.
[2497.72 → 2498.72] All the believers were together.
[2498.72 → 2500.72] They had everything in common.
[2500.72 → 2506.72] They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[2506.72 → 2512.72] When people were changed by the gospel, it immediately made them generous.
[2512.72 → 2513.72] They sought to bless.
[2513.72 → 2517.72] They sought to care for one another out of the abundance.
[2517.72 → 2523.72] Probably not a lot of abundance the way we think about it, but out of the extra that they had to share.
[2523.72 → 2528.72] But here in the church of Ephesus, there were people who were just taking advantage.
[2528.72 → 2531.72] And they're just doing nothing but receiving.
[2531.72 → 2534.72] And Paul sees this, and he calls it theft.
[2534.72 → 2537.72] He says, stop stealing from people.
[2537.72 → 2540.72] And this is something that all churches struggle with.
[2540.72 → 2546.72] You know, where, you know, any church you would go to, there'll be people who say, you know, it's 20% of us doing 8% of the work.
[2546.72 → 2552.72] But like resentment, taking advantage of one another harms' community.
[2552.72 → 2556.72] So there's this habit of nursing anger and taking advantage.
[2556.72 → 2560.72] And finally, there's this, this final habit is the habit of speaking harm.
[2560.72 → 2561.72] The habit of speaking harm.
[2561.72 → 2568.72] And so if you look in verse 29, it says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths.
[2568.72 → 2572.72] Now, this language of unwholesome talk, it's very broad.
[2572.72 → 2578.72] It can mean insults, criticisms, just being unkind.
[2578.72 → 2582.72] It can mean dirty language, you know, like cussing or off colour jokes.
[2582.72 → 2587.72] But verse 31 uses this language of slander.
[2587.72 → 2590.72] So that's probably what Paul is talking about here.
[2590.72 → 2592.72] And what is slander?
[2592.72 → 2601.72] Slander is this habit of speaking about someone else in a way that brings harm to that person in the eyes of others.
[2601.72 → 2602.72] Right?
[2602.72 → 2610.72] It's refusing to let other people think more highly of that person than you think they should.
[2610.72 → 2613.72] And so you have to take them down a notch.
[2613.72 → 2623.72] So this unwholesome talk, it's actually the same word used in the Gospels to talk about rotten fruit and putrid fish.
[2623.72 → 2625.72] That's a gross image.
[2625.72 → 2628.72] But you just take that and you kind of throw that into the community, right?
[2628.72 → 2635.72] But it's this corrupting speech that breaks things down, that rots and corrupts and it stinks.
[2635.72 → 2640.72] And we all do this, but it destroys community.
[2640.72 → 2649.72] So whether it's this nursing of anger or this taking advantage or speaking harm, they each are terrible in their own way.
[2649.72 → 2658.72] And Paul summarizes all of this in verse 31, which is right in the middle of this passage is just this awful verse.
[2658.72 → 2665.72] Because it says, get rid of all bitterness and rage and anger, brawling and slander along with every form of malice.
[2665.72 → 2667.72] From the church.
[2667.72 → 2669.72] This is stuff in the church.
[2669.72 → 2680.72] So Paul calls the Ephesians, and he calls each one of us to recognize how destructive these behaviours are and to get rid of these things from among us.
[2680.72 → 2683.72] So that's the first thing we see here.
[2683.72 → 2688.72] It's just to put off these infernal habits that burn community down.
[2688.72 → 2694.72] And in their place to learn these new habits, these new practices that build community up.
[2694.72 → 2700.72] Right? Because, you know, you don't just take something away because then you have a vacuum, but you have to put something in.
[2700.72 → 2704.72] Now, why are we to do this? Why are we to build community up?
[2704.72 → 2706.72] It's because of the logic of grace.
[2706.72 → 2713.72] Right? Remember, God created us to live together in community with him.
[2713.72 → 2716.72] Right? With fellowship with God and with one another.
[2716.72 → 2723.72] And when we sinned, we destroyed that relationship that God created us to have with him and with others.
[2723.72 → 2726.72] And when we did that, right, we broke the relationship with God.
[2726.72 → 2735.72] God didn't view us as enemies then to cast down, but rather he saw us as children to build up.
[2735.72 → 2739.72] And that's how God sees us.
[2739.72 → 2747.72] Okay? God looks at us with compassion in our sin while we were still his enemies.
[2747.72 → 2752.72] And this fact frees us from the need that we sometimes feel to burn each other down.
[2752.72 → 2756.72] And it frees us instead to do the work of building one another up.
[2756.72 → 2766.72] And so part of the work of the church that we do together as Jesus' body is to be the community in the world that puts on compassion.
[2766.72 → 2768.72] That puts on the compassion of God.
[2768.72 → 2776.72] And it's through putting on habits of compassion with one another, with our neighbours, that we bear witness to the life of God.
[2776.72 → 2778.72] We bear witness to the compassion of God in the world.
[2778.72 → 2781.72] So now what are these habits of compassion?
[2781.72 → 2784.72] Well, there's three of them, of course.
[2784.72 → 2787.72] Nursing forgiveness is the first.
[2787.72 → 2789.72] Listen to verse 32.
[2789.72 → 2795.72] He says, be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as Christ forgave you.
[2795.72 → 2796.72] Right?
[2796.72 → 2799.72] So remember this nursing anger and resentment.
[2799.72 → 2806.72] It burns community down by refusing to forget other people's failures.
[2806.72 → 2818.72] But compassion, on the other hand, builds community up by refusing to remember other people's failures.
[2818.72 → 2823.72] It's not like we forget what people do to us, to hurt us.
[2823.72 → 2827.72] We don't forget that, but we forgive them.
[2827.72 → 2832.72] And we refuse to let those failures determine our relationship with them.
[2832.72 → 2834.72] And why do we do that?
[2834.72 → 2836.72] Why would we do that?
[2836.72 → 2839.72] Because this is what God has done for us.
[2839.72 → 2840.72] Right?
[2840.72 → 2843.72] God had every right to be angry with us.
[2843.72 → 2846.72] He could have left us to die in our sin.
[2846.72 → 2851.72] And he would have been perfectly right and just to do so.
[2851.72 → 2854.72] But out of his love, he forgave us.
[2854.72 → 2861.72] He sent his son to die in our place to bear our sin on himself so that we could be forgiven.
[2861.72 → 2866.72] And he tells us that this is now how we must treat one another.
[2866.72 → 2869.72] We must be constantly forgiving each other.
[2869.72 → 2876.72] And you know, this isn't just a passive thing that we can just let happen because it's not going to just automatically happen.
[2876.72 → 2878.72] Forgiveness is an active work.
[2878.72 → 2882.72] It's being tenderhearted toward others.
[2882.72 → 2883.72] It's being loving to them.
[2883.72 → 2889.72] It's not holding a grudge, but treating them how God has treated us.
[2889.72 → 2894.72] And when we do this, when we do this, we see community being built up.
[2894.72 → 2895.72] Right?
[2895.72 → 2896.72] So that's the first habit.
[2896.72 → 2900.72] The habit of nursing, not anger, but nursing forgiveness.
[2900.72 → 2901.72] Cultivating it.
[2901.72 → 2904.72] Brewing it up and giving it to others.
[2904.72 → 2909.72] Okay, so then secondly, the habit of giving advantage.
[2909.72 → 2911.72] Look at verse 28 again.
[2911.72 → 2913.72] It says,
[2913.72 → 2918.72] Anyone who has been stealing must no longer steal, but must work.
[2918.72 → 2924.72] Doing something useful with their hands so that they may have something to share with those in need.
[2924.72 → 2932.72] Okay, so taking advantage destroys community because everyone's out for themselves at the expense of others.
[2932.72 → 2937.72] But compassion builds up by using its advantage for other people.
[2937.72 → 2938.72] Right?
[2938.72 → 2940.72] That's what it does.
[2940.72 → 2942.72] And God wants us to work.
[2942.72 → 2947.72] He wants us to labour faithfully, honestly, in the world with our hands.
[2947.72 → 2949.72] Why not?
[2949.72 → 2951.72] You know, it's okay to provide for yourselves.
[2951.72 → 2953.72] It's okay to have a little comfort.
[2953.72 → 2961.72] But the point is not to ensure everything just for our own advantage, but rather so that we can ensure the well-being of other people.
[2961.72 → 2963.72] Now, why would we do that?
[2963.72 → 2966.72] Why would we ensure the well-being of other people?
[2966.72 → 2968.72] Because that's what Jesus has done for us.
[2968.72 → 2969.72] Right?
[2969.72 → 2972.72] In chapter 5, verse 2, Paul says,
[2972.72 → 2977.72] And walk in the way of love just as Christ loved us and did what?
[2977.72 → 2983.72] Gave himself for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[2983.72 → 2984.72] Right?
[2984.72 → 2994.72] And so just as Jesus gave himself for our advantage to build us up, that's what we now do as the people of God.
[2994.72 → 3000.72] We replace this habit of taking advantage with this habit of giving advantage.
[3000.72 → 3003.72] And that builds up community.
[3003.72 → 3005.72] Here's the third habit.
[3005.72 → 3008.72] It's the habit of speaking grace.
[3008.72 → 3011.72] And verse 29 says this,
[3011.72 → 3023.72] Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
[3023.72 → 3024.72] Right?
[3024.72 → 3037.72] So instead of using our words to harm other people by tearing them down, destroying their dignity, compassion, right, the compassion of God actually builds community by speaking dignity back into existence.
[3037.72 → 3042.72] By naming it and bestowing it benediction on other people.
[3042.72 → 3045.72] That's what God wants us to do.
[3045.72 → 3048.72] He wants us to speak words that build each other up.
[3048.72 → 3057.72] And that's not just to avoid saying that mean thing that you could have said, but you didn't say, you know.
[3057.72 → 3064.72] Instead, it's actually to learn a new way of speaking.
[3064.72 → 3077.72] To learn how to speak so that the goal and the purpose of our speech is to build up by speaking words of encouragement, by naming the good and the beautiful things that we see in one another.
[3077.72 → 3079.72] Now, why would we do this?
[3079.72 → 3084.72] Why would we go out of our way to speak words of encouragement, to build other people up?
[3084.72 → 3087.72] It's because this is what Jesus has done for us.
[3087.72 → 3088.72] Right?
[3088.72 → 3091.72] When Jesus came into this broken world, what did he say?
[3091.72 → 3096.72] Did he come and say, what a mess.
[3096.72 → 3100.72] I cannot believe you guys, what you have done, right?
[3100.72 → 3101.72] All these things.
[3101.72 → 3102.72] He didn't come down on us.
[3102.72 → 3103.72] What did he do?
[3103.72 → 3106.72] He obviously could have done that, but that's not what Jesus does.
[3106.72 → 3109.72] Instead, he speaks words of compassion.
[3109.72 → 3111.72] Think of Jesus' words.
[3111.72 → 3113.72] What does he say?
[3113.72 → 3118.72] He says to a crippled man, rise up and walk.
[3118.72 → 3123.72] He says to a leper, be clean.
[3123.72 → 3128.72] He says to a woman caught in adultery, neither do I condemn you.
[3128.72 → 3134.72] He says to a bunch of fishermen who can't catch a fish, cast your nets over there.
[3134.72 → 3137.72] He says, take and eat.
[3137.72 → 3141.72] He says, today you will be with me in paradise.
[3141.72 → 3144.72] He says, I'm going to come to your house today.
[3144.72 → 3146.72] He says, peace be with you.
[3146.72 → 3148.72] He says, do not be afraid.
[3148.72 → 3151.72] All of these words of compassion.
[3151.72 → 3152.72] Right?
[3152.72 → 3155.72] These are Jesus' compassionate words to us.
[3155.72 → 3158.72] And this is what we have to do with each other.
[3158.72 → 3164.72] To learn to speak in a way that is rooted in love, is rooted in the compassion of God.
[3164.72 → 3166.72] Does this come easily?
[3166.72 → 3167.72] No, it doesn't.
[3167.72 → 3169.72] I'm terrible at this.
[3169.72 → 3172.72] It takes practice.
[3172.72 → 3178.72] But when we speak this way, it does build up community.
[3178.72 → 3183.72] So these are the practices and habits that God calls us to put on.
[3183.72 → 3187.72] Instead of nursing anger and bitterness, to nurse forgiveness.
[3187.72 → 3193.72] Instead of taking advantage, it's to give advantage.
[3193.72 → 3198.72] Instead of speaking words of harm, to speak words of grace.
[3198.72 → 3204.72] Can you just imagine how those vices destroy community?
[3204.72 → 3206.72] Because you've seen it.
[3206.72 → 3214.72] And can you imagine how these virtues of compassion build community up?
[3214.72 → 3217.72] And you've seen that too.
[3217.72 → 3222.72] Now to wrap up, I just want to take a moment to consider some application.
[3222.72 → 3223.72] Get ready.
[3223.72 → 3224.72] Okay.
[3224.72 → 3229.72] I want to ask you to think about your own interactions with people.
[3229.72 → 3232.72] And I'm going to ask you some questions.
[3232.72 → 3235.72] And I just want you to consider them.
[3235.72 → 3238.72] Ask God to open your heart to them.
[3238.72 → 3239.72] To be honest.
[3239.72 → 3240.72] Okay.
[3240.72 → 3244.72] So first, who are you angry with?
[3244.72 → 3249.72] Who do you need to forgive?
[3249.72 → 3252.72] Are you just delighting the devil?
[3252.72 → 3253.72] Right?
[3253.72 → 3263.72] By letting days or months or years go by, go down on your anger.
[3263.72 → 3264.72] Right?
[3264.72 → 3266.72] Not only does this make the devil happy.
[3266.72 → 3269.72] Paul says here that it grieves the Holy Spirit of God.
[3269.72 → 3272.72] Because it is contrary to the gospel.
[3272.72 → 3274.72] The logic of grace.
[3274.72 → 3276.72] And it burns community down.
[3276.72 → 3279.72] So who do you need to forgive?
[3279.72 → 3284.72] Secondly, are you taking advantage of others in the church?
[3284.72 → 3285.72] Right?
[3285.72 → 3291.72] Do you come here expecting to be served for other people to serve you?
[3291.72 → 3297.72] Or do you come looking to see how can I serve others?
[3297.72 → 3298.72] Right?
[3298.72 → 3301.72] Do you come and ask, who's going to be my friend?
[3301.72 → 3305.72] Or do you come and say, who can I be a friend to?
[3305.72 → 3315.72] And lastly, I want you to think of someone in this church who is doing something really great.
[3315.72 → 3316.72] Right?
[3316.72 → 3319.72] Maybe they are better at you at something.
[3319.72 → 3325.72] And don't be envious of that person, but give thanks to God that he has given them that gift.
[3325.72 → 3326.72] And go tell them.
[3326.72 → 3327.72] Right?
[3327.72 → 3333.72] Speak a word of encouragement to honour God and to recognize the dignity in another person.
[3333.72 → 3338.72] Who can you speak a word of grace to today?
[3338.72 → 3340.72] Let me pray that God would help us.
[3340.72 → 3347.72] Father, this passage is revealing.
[3347.72 → 3348.72] It is convicting.
[3348.72 → 3353.72] But Lord, it is the medicine that we need.
[3353.72 → 3358.72] It is the solution for all of humanity's problems.
[3358.72 → 3369.72] And Lord, you have called us as the church to put on the compassion of God, a compassion that makes no sense to our selfish individual hearts.
[3369.72 → 3372.72] But Lord, it is the logic of the kingdom of God.
[3372.72 → 3375.72] So Lord, you have given us your spirit.
[3375.72 → 3376.72] You are transforming us.
[3376.72 → 3378.72] And you will help us to do this.
[3378.72 → 3387.72] You will build up your church by people being transformed by the gospel and speaking words of love and forgiving and seeking to serve one another.
[3387.72 → 3390.72] Lord, would you make that true here at Lander CRC?
[3390.72 → 3395.72] Would we be a church that is a witness to the compassion of God in the world?
[3395.72 → 3398.72] Lord, we pray for your help in Jesus name.
[3398.72 → 3399.72] Amen.
[3399.72 → 3401.72] Friends, let's stand.
[3401.72 → 3403.72] Let's sing a song of response.
[3403.72 → 3405.72] It's called Speak, O Lord.
[3405.72 → 3428.72] Speak, O Lord.
[3428.72 → 3430.72] Speak, O Lord.
[3430.72 → 3440.72] As we come to you to receive the fruit of your holy word.
[3440.72 → 3446.72] Take your earth, plant it deep in us.
[3446.72 → 3448.72] Shape, O Lord.
[3448.72 → 3450.72] Shape, O Lord.
[3450.72 → 3452.72] Shape, O Lord.
[3452.72 → 3454.72] As the light of Christ.
[3454.72 → 3456.72] As we see in us.
[3456.72 → 3458.72] In the hands of love and our needs of faith.
[3458.72 → 3460.72] Speak, O Lord.
[3460.72 → 3464.72] And fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory.
[3464.72 → 3466.72] Teach us all your glory.
[3466.72 → 3468.72] Teach us all full obedience.
[3468.72 → 3470.72] Holy reverence.
[3470.72 → 3472.72] Holy reverence.

[3551.56 → 3558.40] Help us cross the heights of your plans for us
[3558.40 → 3564.46] Truths not change from the dawn of time
[3564.46 → 3570.54] That will echo down through eternity
[3570.54 → 3577.12] And by grace we'll stand on your promises
[3577.12 → 3584.90] And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us
[3584.90 → 3590.76] Speak, O Lord, till your church is built
[3590.76 → 3597.04] And the earth is built with your glory
[3597.04 → 3615.42] I invite the deacons to come up.

[3779.44 → 3787.44] I'll be praying with you our church community prayer this morning, but before I start, I
[3787.44 → 3795.44] would like to share with you that Serena Said let us know this morning in council that Hank
[3795.44 → 3801.44] Grünewald, who was a previous member at this church, has died.
[3801.44 → 3804.44] I think it was yesterday.
[3804.44 → 3812.44] And he was living with Mike and BEV, Serena's daughter and son-in-law.
[3812.44 → 3818.44] And so I will remember that family in my prayer.
[3818.44 → 3824.44] So would you pray with me?
[3824.44 → 3833.44] Loving God and Father, creator of the universe and shepherd of your people, your loving presence
[3833.44 → 3840.44] is among us, and we can talk with you about our lives as a church community.
[3840.44 → 3849.44] We are the body of Christ and have been purchased at a great price, provided for and protected,
[3849.44 → 3853.44] guarded and guided.
[3853.44 → 3859.44] We pray for worship that glorifies you and that unites your people and blesses them.
[3859.44 → 3864.44] May your unfailing love give us hope.
[3864.44 → 3872.44] As a church body, we pray for spiritual renewal as we plan and prepare our activities for the
[3872.44 → 3874.44] coming year.
[3874.44 → 3884.44] We think of our leadership, pastors, elders, deacons, teachers and helpers, all requiring creative,
[3884.44 → 3896.44] risk-taking abilities and with your presence among us to be confident and able to meet the challenges presented.
[3896.44 → 3911.44] Give our leaders a love of the people and children they will come in contact with and together experience a rich blessing from you as they learn more about your presence in their lives together.
[3911.44 → 3921.44] May many more volunteers and volunteer and may this create unity and enthusiasm in this church.
[3921.44 → 3936.44] May many of us also experience this unity and blessing in joining a small group where we can learn from each other how to live as a rich and caring community with you in our lives.
[3936.44 → 3952.44] May many more volunteers and may we thank you for the opportunity to study your word in the Psalms, in the cross-training classes, the opportunity to immerse ourselves in life enriching lessons from your holy word.
[3952.44 → 3966.44] May many more volunteers and may many more volunteers and may we thank you for the opportunity of coming together in a hospitality event this morning at a barbecue as a bonding event, a blessing for all after our church service.
[3966.44 → 3968.44] May many more volunteers and may we thank you for the opportunity to join us in the community.
[3968.44 → 3976.44] May many more volunteers and may we thank you for our visitors from Iran this evening who will share with us the challenges Christians face in that country.
[3976.44 → 3983.44] May, would you thank you for would you so much.
[3983.44 → 3986.44] salades and may such happy!

[3993.44 → 3995.44] We pray for the bravery of that group in the face of persecution and a redemption from persecution in their land.
[3995.44 → 3999.94] ask an extra measure of your grace in their lives,
[3999.94 → 4005.14] for Quinn and baby Richie and their families surrounding them,
[4005.14 → 4010.44] and Lena's brother John and Pat waiting for a kidney.
[4012.34 → 4017.34] We also think of Diane, Shirley, John, and Henry
[4018.68 → 4023.68] battling illnesses, Ellie waiting for a new home,
[4023.68 → 4028.68] Joyce, Carl, Grace, Jerry and Anne,
[4029.78 → 4033.88] Jeanette in their twilight years seeking your nearness.
[4035.72 → 4039.28] And we pray for comfort for those who are mourning
[4039.28 → 4041.98] the loss of a life of a dear one.
[4041.98 → 4045.86] Recently, Martin and Anne and Jerry,
[4045.86 → 4050.50] and also Mike and BEV and the Grünewald family.
[4050.50 → 4055.50] May God give comfort and strength to carry on.
[4055.50 → 4060.70] And now each one of us can think of one person in our mind
[4060.70 → 4065.50] that is broken and far away from you, someone close to us.
[4065.50 → 4071.50] And we lay those names on your altar for your intervention,
[4071.50 → 4076.50] that they may come to know you as their saviour.
[4076.50 → 4080.50] They need your saving grace in their lives.
[4080.50 → 4085.70] Your redemptive power given as a gift to each one.
[4085.70 → 4091.50] Lord, bring back those persons that have fallen away from our fellowship
[4091.50 → 4094.50] due to COVID or other reasons,
[4094.50 → 4099.50] that we may once again become one body and one spirit as your people.
[4099.50 → 4107.50] With a love and commitment to the community God has placed us
[4107.50 → 4113.50] and equip us to serve in a uniquely Christian way in the public arena.
[4113.50 → 4120.50] May we as your church, along with other Christian churches in this community,
[4120.50 → 4127.50] become a light in the darkness and a blessing to all we come in contact with.
[4127.50 → 4132.50] To work for the common good and benefit of all people,
[4132.50 → 4137.50] that we may be able to help our people and a rich community be experienced in the church.
[4137.50 → 4141.50] I pray that out of his glorious riches,
[4141.50 → 4148.50] he may strengthen us with power through his spirit in our inner being,
[4148.50 → 4153.50] so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith.
[4153.50 → 4157.50] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[4162.50 → 4174.50] Please stand.
[4174.50 → 4176.50] The small group sign-ups are still ongoing.
[4176.50 → 4179.50] I want to encourage everyone to consider being in a small group,
[4179.50 → 4182.50] and then soon we'll kind of look at that list
[4182.50 → 4184.50] and start to help people connect into groups.
[4184.50 → 4186.50] So thank you if you've already signed up.
[4186.50 → 4188.50] We haven't forgotten that you're there.
[4188.50 → 4190.50] Also, you know, we're having our barbecue.
[4190.50 → 4192.50] The barbecue is going to be set up out front,
[4192.50 → 4195.50] but those setting up asked for just a couple of minutes.
[4195.50 → 4202.50] So maybe get your coffee first, and after a few minutes we'll be able to start having our lunch.
[4202.50 → 4206.50] So I invite you to hold out your hands and receive the blessing of the Lord.
[4206.50 → 4211.50] Now to him who is able to keep you from falling,
[4211.50 → 4214.50] and to present you before his glorious presence,
[4214.50 → 4217.50] without fault and with great joy.
[4217.50 → 4223.50] To the only God, our Saviour, be glory, majesty, power, and authority,
[4223.50 → 4229.50] through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages, now and forevermore. Amen.
[4229.50 → 4232.50] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[4232.50 → 4237.50] Like a river of Lord us is God's perfect peace.
[4237.50 → 4239.50] Over all victorious it is brightening grace.
[4239.50 → 4240.50] Perfect and glorious it is brightening grace.
[4240.50 → 4242.50] Perfect and glorious it is brightening grace.
[4242.50 → 4247.50] Perfect and glorious it is brightening grace.
[4247.50 → 4249.50] Perfect and glowing, fuller every day.
[4249.50 → 4251.50] Like a river of Lord us is God's perfect peace.
[4251.50 → 4253.50] Like a river of Lord us is God's perfect peace.
[4253.50 → 4255.50] Over all victorious it is brightening grace.
[4255.50 → 4259.50] Over all victorious it is brightening grace.
[4259.50 → 4273.38] extend
[4273.38 → 4281.50] Perfect and glorious it is brightening grace.
[4281.50 → 4284.06] Perfect and glowing, fuller every day.
[4284.06 → 4293.94] In the Father's hearts are fully vast,
[4293.94 → 4304.32] Finding as He promised perfect peace and rest.
[4304.32 → 4314.60] Hidden in the hollow of this earthly hand,
[4314.60 → 4324.80] Where no one can follow, in His strength we stand.
[4324.80 → 4334.50] We may trust Him holy, all for us to do.
[4334.50 → 4344.26] Those who trust Him holy, find Him only true.
[4344.26 → 4356.96] Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully vast,
[4356.96 → 4368.96] Finding as He promised perfect peace and rest.
[4368.96 → 4380.82] Have you?
[4380.82 → 4391.76] Good and Blessed Yes which is not He will,
[4391.76 → 4421.74] Thank you.
