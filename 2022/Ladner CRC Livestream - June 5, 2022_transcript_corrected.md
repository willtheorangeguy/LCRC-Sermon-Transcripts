[301.56 → 303.56] Amen.
[303.56 → 307.56] Please stand with us as we sing our first song.
[307.56 → 331.56] We were waiting for he rose up to heaven.
[331.56 → 341.56] Not sure of what was to happen, but they stayed there together and prayed.
[341.56 → 348.56] Lord and Mary, coming and calling on each day,
[348.56 → 352.56] hoping in the healing empty,
[352.56 → 357.56] but believing in this will soon change.
[357.56 → 364.56] Holy Spirit, Holy, Holy Spirit,
[364.56 → 372.56] you filled up their hearts and gave them words of truth.
[372.56 → 379.56] Of their Jesus, Holy, Holy Jesus,
[379.56 → 387.56] you empowered them and breathed in them to move.
[387.56 → 394.56] Then the sound came, a violent wind after ten days,
[394.56 → 402.56] rushing, filling up that place, and cries like tongues were amazed.
[402.56 → 409.56] And you called for them, cutting their hearts when there was doubt,
[409.56 → 413.56] breathing in them as they bowed down,
[413.56 → 417.56] declaring for Jesus this day.
[417.56 → 422.56] Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,
[422.56 → 427.56] Holy Spirit, Holy, Holy Spirit,
[428.56 → 435.56] You filled up their hearts and gave them words of truth.
[435.56 → 449.40] Father Jesus, holy, holy Jesus, you empower them and breathe in them to move.
[451.34 → 461.70] And now you come, Spirit, you come here among us, rushing and filling up our hearts,
[461.70 → 466.46] and the fire in us is the place.
[467.46 → 473.46] There's the door out, counting our hearts where there is doubt,
[473.92 → 480.82] breathing in us as we melt down, declaring that Jesus is dead.
[480.82 → 496.98] Holy Spirit, holy, Holy Spirit, you fill up our hearts and gave us words of truth.
[496.98 → 511.26] Of our Jesus, holy, holy Jesus, you empower God to stand and breathe in us to move.
[513.24 → 523.62] We are waiting for he rose up to heaven, unsure of what is to happen,
[523.62 → 528.40] but we stay here together and pray.
[530.26 → 530.92] You may be seated.
[536.62 → 537.98] Good morning to you all.
[538.30 → 538.84] Good morning.
[539.18 → 541.34] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[541.50 → 542.68] My name is Jason True.
[542.78 → 543.96] I'm the lead pastor here.
[544.38 → 547.78] And it is great to be gathered together in worship.
[548.46 → 552.86] Our Lord, God and Saviour, the Holy Spirit has called us together.
[552.86 → 555.88] He has made us one people through Christ.
[557.04 → 563.56] So before we continue our worship this morning, there are just a few announcements to share.
[564.04 → 568.96] And first, I'm just going to invite Tony to come up and share one announcement.
[568.96 → 583.44] As many of you have read in the bulletin the last couple of weeks,
[583.58 → 591.58] there will be an affirmation vote next week for three new members of council.
[591.58 → 600.46] For the deacons, we will be affirming Brian Grotendorst, Elaine Smith and Edgar Wong,
[600.90 → 603.00] and for Elder Jack Mantra.
[604.14 → 607.88] As I said, that vote will take place after the service next week.
[607.88 → 616.72] What's important to stress, I guess, this morning is that for those of us who will not be able to make next week's service,
[617.34 → 620.62] there are absentee ballots available on the table in the foyer.
[621.50 → 624.78] You can fill them out and bring them back.
[624.78 → 631.14] Put the signature just on the envelope, not on the ballot that you would fill out,
[631.30 → 639.86] and then return it to the office in the clerk's mail slot or in the mailbox just outside the front doors.
[639.86 → 651.78] And then on the 19th, we will, because there are three deacons and only two required,
[651.90 → 659.50] we will pull those out of a hat, I guess, see which two ultimately will serve for the next three years.
[660.06 → 661.68] Okay? Thank you.
[661.68 → 674.28] Just one more announcement for this morning, which is that on June 19th,
[674.42 → 675.32] which is going to be a busy day,
[675.96 → 680.14] we will have Anzac and Ajee Imran come and share their ministry.
[680.80 → 684.14] And so they'll be with us for worship, but then after our worship service,
[684.14 → 686.02] we're all going to gather in the fellowship hall.
[686.32 → 689.76] They're going to take the opportunity to share about their ministry while we're gathered there.
[689.76 → 694.16] And also we wanted to show some hospitality and have lunch together.
[694.30 → 698.88] It also has been so long since we've been able to eat together after our worship service.
[699.12 → 706.92] So we're asking if there are any who would be willing to sign up to make some soup or bring some buns.
[707.00 → 708.94] So it's going to be a soup and buns lunch.
[709.36 → 711.34] So there is a sign-up sheet in the foyer table,
[711.66 → 716.52] and I've never experienced yet the soup lunch of Lander CRC.
[716.52 → 720.06] So I expect to be impressed.
[720.26 → 720.60] Just kidding.
[721.14 → 724.94] No, I think it will be a fun time of fellowship together
[724.94 → 728.52] and hearing about what God is doing all over the world, especially in the Middle East.
[729.88 → 734.50] So with that, let's come before the Lord and hear this call to worship.
[734.72 → 738.76] I want to begin by reading from Acts chapter 2,
[739.08 → 741.52] because today is the day of Pentecost.
[741.52 → 742.04] Pentecost.
[742.44 → 748.26] In the church calendar, we celebrate Pentecost Sunday as the day when the promised Holy Spirit
[748.26 → 752.14] was poured out upon his church, empowering the church,
[752.20 → 755.68] even from the beginning of Acts all the way up until today.
[756.10 → 761.20] The Holy Spirit is among us, empowering us to follow Jesus, to know him, to live as his people.
[761.84 → 763.26] And so we remember that day today.
[763.46 → 766.42] So let me read Acts chapter 2, verses 1 to 4,
[767.36 → 768.80] and then we'll go into our call to worship.
[768.80 → 774.40] When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
[775.46 → 780.66] Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven
[780.66 → 784.02] and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
[785.18 → 791.44] They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
[791.44 → 799.48] All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
[801.64 → 802.96] Now please, let's say this.
[803.14 → 804.18] Call to worship together.
[804.40 → 805.46] Where is the double arrow?
[805.88 → 807.04] I'll invite you to respond.
[808.16 → 814.40] Spirit of the living God, visit us again on this day of Pentecost.
[814.40 → 816.54] Come Holy Spirit.
[816.98 → 820.26] Like a rushing wind that sweeps away all barriers.
[821.08 → 822.46] Come Holy Spirit.
[823.08 → 826.34] Like tongues of fire that set our hearts aflame.
[827.00 → 828.34] Come Holy Spirit.
[829.00 → 832.02] With speech that unites the babble of our tongues.
[832.70 → 833.92] Come Holy Spirit.
[833.92 → 838.44] With love that overlaps the boundaries of race and nation.
[839.10 → 840.36] Come Holy Spirit.
[840.88 → 845.14] With power from above to make our weakness strong.
[845.70 → 847.28] Come Holy Spirit.
[847.80 → 848.28] Amen.
[848.88 → 850.10] Would you please join me in prayer?
[851.96 → 853.46] Our Father in heaven,
[854.46 → 860.24] you surprised and amazed your disciples at Pentecost with the gift of your Holy Spirit.
[860.24 → 867.20] We praise you for the Spirit who still fills our lives and hearts.
[868.02 → 872.98] Father, send your mighty Spirit on us as we worship you this morning.
[874.04 → 883.02] Fill us with joy and excitement that comes from knowing you and having a covenant relationship with you through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[883.66 → 886.02] In whose name we pray.
[886.52 → 886.88] Amen.
[886.88 → 887.00] Amen.
[887.00 → 887.08] Amen.
[890.58 → 900.42] And so now, please stand in spirit or in body as you are able and hear God's greetings to us from Romans 5, chapter 5, verse 5.
[901.02 → 908.36] Paul writes, God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
[909.18 → 910.00] Thanks be to God.
[910.26 → 913.72] Now as the Lord has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another this morning.
[913.72 → 913.76] Amen.
[917.00 → 917.72] Amen.
[917.72 → 917.84] Amen.
[919.60 → 921.62] Amen.
[921.62 → 922.66] Amen.
[923.92 → 924.34] Amen.
[924.34 → 925.66] Cheers.
[925.82 → 926.58] Amen.
[928.58 → 928.84] Cheers.
[929.02 → 930.68] Amen.
[931.36 → 933.22] Amen.
[933.22 → 933.52] Amen.
[933.52 → 934.06] Amen.
[934.06 → 934.54] Amen.
[934.68 → 935.06] Amen.
[935.84 → 936.28] Amen.

[938.40 → 938.58] Amen.
[938.60 → 938.92] Amen.
[938.92 → 939.60] Amen.
[939.60 → 941.02] Amen.
[941.02 → 941.60] Amen.
[942.00 → 942.62] Amen.
[942.62 → 943.02] Amen.
[943.02 → 944.66] Amen.
[944.66 → 945.40] Amen.
[945.54 → 946.00] Amen.
[946.00 → 946.94] Amen.
[946.94 → 946.98] Amen.
[947.00 → 966.26] O people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise,
[966.26 → 974.32] Come all, and tune your hearts to sing to the Lord His Son of praise.
[974.32 → 982.44] From the shining shadows of the earth, we will live for us to live,
[982.94 → 989.66] Where Saviour's a mercy to gather to bring.
[991.88 → 998.80] Rejoice, rejoice, let every God rejoice,
[998.80 → 1006.42] One heart, one voice, O church of Christ, rejoice.
[1006.42 → 1020.54] Come those who join His morning sun and His way through the night,
[1020.54 → 1028.04] Come those who tell the man's work in the sun and the night.
[1028.04 → 1036.52] For His perfect love will never change, and His mercies never cease.
[1037.24 → 1044.04] Our love will watch through our days with a certain peace.
[1044.04 → 1052.84] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[1053.24 → 1060.04] One heart, one voice, O church of Christ, rejoice.
[1060.04 → 1069.24] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue and the night.
[1069.24 → 1074.16] Come young and old from every man, men and women of the free.
[1074.16 → 1082.24] Come those who fall, O Lord, and dear to the riches of His grace.
[1082.24 → 1087.44] Over all the world, His people, sin and the truth of His glory.
[1087.44 → 1091.44] Come those who pray, O church of Christ, O church of Christ,
[1091.44 → 1098.44] The truth that writes through every angel, our God is all beyond.
[1098.44 → 1107.44] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[1107.44 → 1115.64] One heart, one voice, O church of Christ, rejoice.
[1115.64 → 1123.64] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[1123.64 → 1131.64] One heart, one voice, O church of Christ, rejoice.
[1131.64 → 1153.84] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice,
[1153.84 → 1160.84] O Lord my God, when I am in awesome honour,
[1160.84 → 1168.04] Consider all the firsts I am to pay.
[1168.04 → 1175.04] I see the stars, I hear the mighty wonder,
[1175.04 → 1182.04] Thy power throughout the universe display.
[1182.04 → 1189.04] When through the woods and forest plains I wander,
[1189.04 → 1196.24] I hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
[1196.24 → 1203.24] When I look down from lofty mountain red dirt,
[1203.24 → 1210.24] And hear them look and feel the gentle breeze.
[1210.24 → 1212.44] When I look down from lofty mountain red dirt,
[1212.44 → 1217.44] And hear them look and feel the gentle breeze.
[1217.44 → 1224.64] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1224.64 → 1230.64] And sing my soul, my Saviour God's feet.
[1230.64 → 1237.84] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1237.84 → 1239.04] And sing my soul, my Saviour God's feet.
[1239.04 → 1246.04] But when I think that God is sun-lots bearing,
[1246.04 → 1253.04] Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in.
[1253.04 → 1260.24] That on my cross, my burden gladly bearing,
[1260.24 → 1267.44] He let them die to take it in.
[1267.44 → 1274.64] And sing my soul, my Saviour God's feet.
[1274.64 → 1276.84] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1276.84 → 1284.84] And sing my soul, my Saviour God's feet.
[1284.84 → 1287.84] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1287.84 → 1291.84] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1291.84 → 1296.84] I'll bring the light of the earth.
[1296.84 → 1299.04] When Christ shall come,
[1299.04 → 1300.04] When Christ shall come,
[1300.04 → 1304.04] We shall the baffling nation,
[1304.04 → 1307.04] And pray it's all,
[1307.04 → 1311.04] But joy shall fill my heart.
[1311.04 → 1314.04] Then I shall bow,
[1314.04 → 1318.04] In humble adoration,
[1318.04 → 1321.04] And there proclaim,
[1321.04 → 1326.04] My God, I'll bring the light.
[1326.04 → 1328.24] Then sing my soul,
[1328.24 → 1333.24] My Saviour God's feet.
[1333.24 → 1340.24] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1340.24 → 1343.24] Then sing my soul,
[1343.24 → 1347.24] My Saviour God's feet.
[1347.24 → 1351.24] I'll bring the light of the earth,
[1351.24 → 1358.44] The great light of the earth.
[1358.44 → 1360.64] You may be seated.
[1360.64 → 1362.84] Amen.
[1362.84 → 1363.84] Amen.
[1363.84 → 1364.84] Amen.
[1364.84 → 1365.84] Amen.
[1365.84 → 1366.84] Amen.
[1366.84 → 1367.84] Amen.
[1367.84 → 1368.84] Amen.
[1368.84 → 1369.84] Well, before we sing our next song,
[1369.84 → 1371.84] Holy Spirit, Breath of God,
[1371.84 → 1376.84] Our worship committee has the idea to read together this,
[1376.84 → 1379.84] this poem by Malcolm Gwent,
[1379.84 → 1381.84] about Pentecost.
[1381.84 → 1383.84] So when I say read together,
[1383.84 → 1384.84] I'll read it for us.
[1384.84 → 1388.04] It says this,
[1388.04 → 1393.04] Today, we feel the wind beneath our wings.
[1393.04 → 1397.04] Today, the hidden fountain flows and plays.
[1397.04 → 1402.04] Today, the church draws breath at last and sings,
[1402.04 → 1406.04] As every flame becomes a tongue of praise.
[1406.04 → 1412.24] This is the feast of fire, air, and water,
[1412.24 → 1416.24] Poured out and breathed and kindled into earth.
[1416.24 → 1420.24] The earth herself awakens to her maker
[1420.24 → 1424.24] And is translated out of death to birth.
[1424.24 → 1428.44] The right words come today in their right order.
[1428.44 → 1432.44] And every word spells freedom and release.
[1432.44 → 1435.44] Today, the gospel crosses every border.
[1435.44 → 1440.44] All tongues are loosened by the Prince of Peace.
[1440.44 → 1445.44] Today, the lost is found in his translation,
[1445.44 → 1449.44] Whose mother tongue is love in every nation.
[1449.44 → 1453.64] So let's stand one more time and let's sing,
[1453.64 → 1456.64] Holy Spirit, living breath of God.
[1456.64 → 1457.64] Let's sing together.
[1457.64 → 1463.84] Holy Spirit, living breath of God,
[1463.84 → 1471.84] Bring new life into my willing soul.
[1471.84 → 1476.84] Holy Spirit, living breath of God,
[1476.84 → 1483.84] Bring new life into my willing soul.
[1483.84 → 1490.04] Bring the presence of the risen Lord,
[1490.04 → 1496.04] To renew my heart and make me whole.
[1496.04 → 1503.04] Cause the word to love alive in me,
[1503.04 → 1510.04] Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[1510.04 → 1516.24] Give me passion for your purity.
[1516.24 → 1522.24] Holy Spirit, breathe new life into me.
[1522.24 → 1529.24] Holy Spirit, come abide with Him.
[1529.24 → 1535.24] May your joy be seen in all I do.
[1535.24 → 1541.44] Love be not to cover every sin,
[1541.44 → 1547.44] In each thought and deed and aptitude.
[1547.44 → 1554.44] Kindness through the greatest and the least,
[1554.44 → 1561.44] Gentleness that slows the path of peace.
[1561.44 → 1567.64] Turn my striving into works of grace.
[1567.64 → 1573.64] Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[1573.64 → 1580.64] Holy Spirit, from creation's birth,
[1580.64 → 1586.64] Giving life to all that God has made.
[1586.64 → 1592.84] Show your power once again on earth.
[1592.84 → 1598.84] Cause your church to hunger for your grace.
[1598.84 → 1606.84] Let the frivolous of our prayers arise.
[1606.84 → 1613.04] Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[1613.04 → 1619.04] That in unity the face of Christ
[1619.04 → 1626.04] May be here for all the world to see.
[1626.04 → 1636.24] Let the frivolous of our prayers.
[1636.24 → 1640.24] Okay, so at this time children grade three through,
[1640.24 → 1646.24] Age three through grade seven are welcome to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1646.24 → 1666.44] So go ahead.
[1666.44 → 1669.44] Let's give them a moment.
[1669.44 → 1672.44] Okay.
[1672.44 → 1677.64] So let's, well we now here come to the moment in our,
[1677.64 → 1682.64] in our worship service where after having been called by God into his presence and worship
[1682.64 → 1687.64] and being invited to lift our hearts and our voices in song and to adore God.
[1687.64 → 1691.84] We now come before him with his prayer of confession.
[1691.84 → 1694.84] Seeing how, how great and mighty God is,
[1694.84 → 1702.84] it causes us to realize that we actually in his sight fall short of the life that he has called us to.
[1702.84 → 1705.84] And so we practice repentance as a church together.
[1705.84 → 1710.84] So let's say these, this prayer of confession in unison,
[1710.84 → 1714.84] and then it'll give us a moment to quietly confess our sins before the Lord.
[1714.84 → 1720.04] Almighty God, to whom all hearts are open,
[1720.04 → 1722.04] all desires known,
[1722.04 → 1725.04] and from whom no secrets are hid,
[1725.04 → 1728.04] cleanse the thoughts of our hearts
[1728.04 → 1731.04] by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit,
[1731.04 → 1734.04] that we may perfectly love you
[1734.04 → 1737.04] and worthily magnify your holy name
[1737.04 → 1740.04] through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1740.04 → 1741.04] Amen.
[1741.04 → 1769.24] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you with humble and contrite hearts.
[1769.24 → 1775.44] Because, Lord, you made us to know you and love you and worship you
[1775.44 → 1783.44] and to have our hearts totally focused and centred on who you are.
[1783.44 → 1789.44] And yet, Lord, we confess that in so many ways we disobey your law.
[1789.44 → 1794.24] We fail to love you with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[1794.24 → 1796.44] and to love our neighbour as ourselves.
[1796.44 → 1802.64] But, Father, we thank you for your great salvation that saves us from the wrath of God against our sin.
[1802.64 → 1806.64] And, Lord, even now as we wait for the completion of our redemption,
[1806.64 → 1811.64] we still have the sinful nature within us and your Holy Spirit.
[1811.64 → 1813.64] And so, Lord, we struggle.
[1813.64 → 1814.64] We struggle to follow you.
[1814.64 → 1823.44] But, Lord, we struggle under the umbrella of your grace that is so freely given to us through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[1823.44 → 1826.64] who has forgiven us of our sins.
[1826.64 → 1830.64] Lord, help us to continue to walk in your truth and in your light.
[1830.64 → 1831.84] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1831.84 → 1832.84] Amen.
[1832.84 → 1839.84] Here are these words of assurance from the Old Testament prophet of Ezekiel.
[1839.84 → 1841.04] He says,
[1841.04 → 1842.04] He says,
[1842.04 → 1872.04] 
[1872.04 → 1874.24] Here we are united with Christ.
[1874.24 → 1876.24] We are given a new spirit.
[1876.24 → 1882.24] Live in the joy and the peace of the assurance of that truth.
[1882.24 → 1886.24] Let's rise one more time and let's sing our song of response.
[1886.24 → 1888.24] There is a Redeemer.
[1888.24 → 1889.24] Please stand.
[1889.24 → 1901.44] There is a Redeemer.
[1901.44 → 1906.44] Jesus Christ, O Son.
[1906.44 → 1915.44] Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[1915.44 → 1923.64] Thank you, O Father, for giving us your Son,
[1923.64 → 1932.64] And leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[1932.64 → 1942.64] Jesus, my Redeemer, name of all names,
[1942.64 → 1946.84] Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[1946.84 → 1948.84] Jesus, my Redeemer, name of all names,
[1948.84 → 1952.84] And leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[1952.84 → 1954.84] Jesus, my Redeemer, name of all names,
[1954.84 → 1955.84] Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[1955.84 → 1960.84] Thank you, O Father, for giving us your Son,
[1960.84 → 1969.84] And leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[1969.84 → 1980.04] When I stand in glory, I will see His face.
[1980.04 → 1989.04] There I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
[1989.04 → 1999.24] Thank you, O Father, for giving us your Son,
[1999.24 → 2009.24] And leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[2009.24 → 2019.44] As we come to the preaching and hearing of God's word,
[2019.44 → 2034.44] Let me pray for the Holy Spirit to illumine our hearts.
[2034.44 → 2036.64] Let's pray together.
[2036.64 → 2041.64] O Lord, open our hearts and minds by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[2041.64 → 2045.64] That as the scriptures are read and your word is proclaimed,
[2045.64 → 2048.64] We may hear with joy what you say to us today.
[2048.64 → 2050.64] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2050.64 → 2052.64] Amen.
[2052.64 → 2058.64] So, I am excited that today we are starting a new sermon series
[2058.64 → 2063.84] on the letter to the Ephesians, the letter to the Ephesians in the New Testament.
[2063.84 → 2067.84] And we are calling this series Life Together.
[2067.84 → 2069.84] A Life Together.
[2069.84 → 2073.84] Because Ephesians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul
[2073.84 → 2077.84] to the church about the church.
[2077.84 → 2080.84] It is written to the church about the church.
[2080.84 → 2087.04] And before we read the passage, what I want to do is just talk for a little bit,
[2087.04 → 2090.04] by way of introduction, about this letter,
[2090.04 → 2094.04] and about what I hope we can do in this series.
[2094.04 → 2101.04] So, you need to know a little bit about life in ancient Ephesus.
[2101.04 → 2105.04] Ephesus is a city in the Roman Empire.
[2105.04 → 2108.04] So, go there with me.
[2108.04 → 2109.04] Okay?
[2109.04 → 2112.04] Use your imaginations.
[2112.04 → 2116.24] The Roman Empire, Asia Minor, 2,000 years ago.
[2116.24 → 2121.24] This is important for us to know because one of the ambitions of the Roman Empire
[2121.24 → 2128.24] was to conquer all of these far-reaching lands, all of these people,
[2128.24 → 2134.24] and to unite them under imperial rule.
[2134.24 → 2142.44] And in the time of Paul, it would be under the reign of one Caesar, Caesar Augustus.
[2142.44 → 2147.44] And as you can imagine, this caused tremendous upheaval.
[2147.44 → 2148.44] Right?
[2148.44 → 2154.24] Everything that gave all of these different peoples spread all over the Mediterranean,
[2154.24 → 2156.44] in Europe, right?
[2156.44 → 2161.44] And in what is now Turkey, Asia Minor, and all in the Middle East and into Africa.
[2161.44 → 2162.64] All of these different peoples.
[2162.64 → 2168.64] And what gave all of these peoples meaning and identity was a shared custom, a shared language,
[2172.64 → 2173.64] and shared stories.
[2174.64 → 2175.24] Right?
[2175.24 → 2178.44] But all of this was disrupted.
[2178.44 → 2186.44] And the goal of Rome was to take all of these different peoples that they had conquered and make them one.
[2186.44 → 2188.44] That's what they were trying to do.
[2188.44 → 2191.44] But this was always a fragile situation.
[2191.44 → 2194.44] That's why they had so many soldiers.
[2194.44 → 2198.44] Because it wasn't an enforced oneness.
[2198.44 → 2204.64] And in many Roman cities, like Ephesus, the Jews were one of these minority peoples.
[2204.64 → 2208.64] And they lived together with these Gentiles, different peoples from all over the world,
[2208.64 → 2213.64] in this uneasy unity under the eye of Roman soldiers.
[2213.64 → 2216.64] So can you imagine that?
[2216.64 → 2220.64] Imagine the mass migrations of people.
[2220.64 → 2225.84] Because they built these Roman roads that connected all of these different places.
[2225.84 → 2227.84] They united people under one common currency.
[2227.84 → 2233.84] People moving into the cities, like Ephesus, one of the most magnificent cities in the ancient world.
[2233.84 → 2235.44] All of these different people.
[2235.44 → 2238.84] Globalization, 2000 years ago, living together.
[2238.84 → 2243.04] With all of these different religions and worldviews and beliefs.
[2243.04 → 2248.04] Under the cult of imperial worship where they worshipped the emperor.
[2248.04 → 2251.04] Under all these different pagan religions.
[2251.04 → 2259.04] And into that context, what happened in the first century is something amazing.
[2259.04 → 2265.04] That all kinds of people defying the stated wishes of the Roman Empire started to become Christians.
[2265.04 → 2274.24] And these Christians believed that in Jesus Christ, God had revealed himself as the one true God.
[2274.24 → 2277.24] And they believed that God was calling all kinds of people.
[2277.24 → 2280.24] Jew and Gentile.
[2280.24 → 2282.24] Man and woman.
[2282.24 → 2283.24] Slave and free.
[2283.24 → 2285.24] Child and parent.
[2285.24 → 2286.24] That God was calling them all.
[2286.24 → 2287.24] Bringing them all.
[2287.24 → 2293.24] Uniting them all into one new community called the church.
[2293.24 → 2299.44] And they believed that the church was where true unity among all these different peoples was to be found.
[2299.44 → 2307.44] That it would not be found as subjects of Rome, but as citizens of God's kingdom.
[2307.44 → 2312.44] And so these different people, they began to meet in one another's homes.
[2312.44 → 2314.44] Which they had never done before.
[2314.44 → 2318.44] They began to sit at one another's tables.
[2318.44 → 2320.44] Which they had never done before.
[2320.44 → 2323.64] And they began to eat one another's food.
[2323.64 → 2326.64] And how do you think it tasted?
[2326.64 → 2327.64] Weird.
[2327.64 → 2328.64] Right?
[2328.64 → 2333.64] So they began to sing together.
[2333.64 → 2335.64] They began to pray for one another.
[2335.64 → 2337.64] They began to bear one another's burdens.
[2337.64 → 2339.64] It was completely radical.
[2339.64 → 2341.64] And it was really hard.
[2341.64 → 2347.84] And the reason it was so hard was because they were coming together from all of these different cultural backgrounds.
[2347.84 → 2351.84] And they had all these different stories about who they were.
[2351.84 → 2353.84] Where they had come from.
[2353.84 → 2356.84] And so they're trying to live together.
[2356.84 → 2361.84] And the question that came in the early church that we read about in the book of Acts.
[2361.84 → 2368.04] Is how can all of these different people live together as one new community?
[2368.04 → 2371.04] What does it mean to be the church?
[2371.04 → 2374.04] This beautiful and diverse community of God's people.
[2374.04 → 2375.04] Right?
[2375.04 → 2377.04] What does it mean to be the body of Christ?
[2377.04 → 2378.44] The bride of Christ?
[2378.44 → 2380.04] The temple of Christ?
[2380.04 → 2385.04] These wonderful metaphors that Paul gives us about the family of God.
[2385.04 → 2388.44] And it was to answer these questions.
[2388.44 → 2390.44] How is this possible?
[2390.44 → 2395.14] That Paul wrote, I believe, the book of Ephesians.
[2395.14 → 2398.84] And he wrote this letter not only to the church in Ephesus.
[2398.84 → 2402.54] And it was a circular letter said to the churches all in Asia Minor.
[2402.54 → 2406.44] But by the inspiration of God's spirit, it was written to us as well.
[2406.44 → 2409.44] And so trust in God to lead us.
[2409.44 → 2411.54] We're going to turn to Ephesians.
[2411.54 → 2416.24] To learn what God's glorious and thrilling design is for the church.
[2416.24 → 2420.44] And friends, I want to talk about this now because I think it's so timely.
[2420.44 → 2424.64] How can we live together as a church?
[2424.64 → 2428.14] Not only as a local church, maybe, but as a denomination.
[2428.14 → 2431.94] As the body of Christ around the world.
[2431.94 → 2433.94] Paul tells us in this letter.
[2433.94 → 2436.84] So let's turn our attention to the first passage.
[2436.84 → 2439.14] We're just going to be going passage by passage.
[2439.14 → 2441.24] Over the summer in the book of Ephesians.
[2441.24 → 2443.94] So I'll invite Ashley to read the passage for us.
[2443.94 → 2452.74] Ephesians 1, 1 to 14.
[2452.74 → 2458.74] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God.
[2458.74 → 2461.04] To God's holy people in Ephesus.
[2461.04 → 2462.74] The faithful in Christ Jesus.
[2462.74 → 2467.54] Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2467.54 → 2475.84] Praise be to the God and Father for Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[2475.84 → 2479.64] For he chose us in him before the creation of the world.
[2479.64 → 2482.64] To be holy and blameless in his sight.
[2482.64 → 2487.64] In love he predestined us for the adoption to son ship through Jesus Christ.
[2487.64 → 2490.64] In accordance with his pleasure and will.
[2490.64 → 2496.64] To the praise of his glorious grace which he has freely given us in the one he loves.
[2496.64 → 2499.44] In him we have redemption through his blood.
[2499.44 → 2505.44] The forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of God's grace that he lavished on us.
[2505.44 → 2510.44] With all wisdom and understanding he made known to us the mystery of his will.
[2510.44 → 2514.44] According to his good pleasure which he purposed in Christ.
[2514.44 → 2519.44] Christ to be put into effect when the time times reach their fulfillment.
[2519.44 → 2524.24] To bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
[2524.24 → 2527.24] In him we were also chosen.
[2527.24 → 2531.24] Having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything.
[2531.24 → 2534.24] In conformity with the purpose of his will.
[2534.24 → 2538.24] In order that we who were the first to put our hope in Christ.
[2538.24 → 2541.24] Might be for the praise of his glory.
[2541.24 → 2545.24] And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth.
[2545.24 → 2547.24] The gospel of your salvation.
[2547.24 → 2551.04] When you believed you were marked in him with the seal.
[2551.04 → 2553.04] The promised Holy Spirit.
[2553.04 → 2556.04] Who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance.
[2556.04 → 2559.04] Until the redemption of those who are in God's possession.
[2559.04 → 2561.04] To the praise of his glory.
[2561.04 → 2563.04] This is the word of the Lord.
[2563.04 → 2565.04] Thanks be to God.
[2571.04 → 2574.04] It's quite an amazing passage, and I'll get to that in a moment.
[2574.04 → 2576.84] But first.
[2576.84 → 2579.84] I wanted to tell you about Larry Walters.
[2579.84 → 2582.84] When Larry Walters was 13 years old.
[2582.84 → 2584.84] He went to a local shop.
[2584.84 → 2587.84] And in this shop he saw.
[2587.84 → 2588.84] Some weather balloons.
[2588.84 → 2590.84] Hanging from the ceiling.
[2590.84 → 2594.84] And it was at that moment that a plan was hatched in his mind.
[2594.84 → 2596.84] A plan that he nurtured.
[2596.84 → 2599.84] And kept and held onto for the next 20 years.
[2599.84 → 2604.64] Until he found himself one afternoon in the backyard of his house.
[2604.64 → 2606.64] Sitting on a lawn chair.
[2606.64 → 2611.64] Connected to 42 helium filled weather balloons.
[2611.64 → 2615.64] And his plan was that he was going to float up into the air.
[2615.64 → 2617.64] Sitting in his lawn chair.
[2617.64 → 2618.64] Connected to all these balloons.
[2618.64 → 2621.64] And he was going to float from California.
[2621.64 → 2624.64] East across the Mojave Desert.
[2624.64 → 2629.44] But things didn't quite work out that way.
[2629.44 → 2631.44] Surprising right?
[2631.44 → 2634.44] When his friends cut the first tether.
[2634.44 → 2636.44] The force was so great.
[2636.44 → 2638.44] That all the other tethers just snapped.
[2638.44 → 2641.44] And Larry found himself shooting up into the air.
[2641.44 → 2643.44] At over 1,000 feet per minute.
[2643.44 → 2647.24] We know this because 15 minutes later.
[2647.24 → 2649.24] There was a call to air traffic control.
[2649.24 → 2651.24] A pilot flying through the air.
[2651.24 → 2654.24] Saw him at 16,000 feet.
[2654.24 → 2658.24] And said air traffic control.
[2658.24 → 2659.24] We have a situation.
[2659.24 → 2663.24] Now Larry was so freaked out.
[2663.24 → 2665.24] By how this unfolded.
[2665.24 → 2667.24] That he dropped his BB gun.
[2667.24 → 2671.24] So you see the BB gun was supposed to be used.
[2671.24 → 2675.04] To shoot down the balloons one by one.
[2675.04 → 2678.04] To then enable him to have a nice gentle descent.
[2678.04 → 2681.04] But he dropped the BB gun.
[2681.04 → 2684.04] Fortunately, at that altitude.
[2684.04 → 2687.04] The balloons started losing air on their own.
[2687.04 → 2688.04] In a matter of hours.
[2688.04 → 2691.04] Larry found himself gently floating back.
[2691.04 → 2693.04] To Laguna Beach, California.
[2693.04 → 2696.04] Where he became entangled in some telephone wires.
[2696.04 → 2699.04] But otherwise was completely uninjured.
[2699.04 → 2701.84] When injured.
[2701.84 → 2703.84] I tell you this story.
[2703.84 → 2707.84] Because I think we all have a little bit of Larry in us.
[2707.84 → 2710.84] We all want something that tells us our life.
[2710.84 → 2713.84] Is more than just this earthly ground.
[2713.84 → 2715.84] That we stand on.
[2717.84 → 2718.84] We all long.
[2718.84 → 2719.84] Because God made us this way.
[2719.84 → 2722.84] We all long for a taste of glory.
[2722.84 → 2726.84] We long to be involved in something that is much larger.
[2726.84 → 2729.24] Than who we are.
[2729.24 → 2729.64] Right?
[2729.64 → 2731.64] We want to shoot up in the atmosphere.
[2731.64 → 2734.64] We want to be caught up in glory.
[2734.64 → 2735.84] In what is true.
[2735.84 → 2736.64] And beautiful.
[2736.64 → 2737.64] And good.
[2737.64 → 2741.14] And I think that's exactly what Paul has in mind.
[2741.14 → 2743.64] As he writes this opening to this letter.
[2743.64 → 2747.64] He's telling us that we can find our place in this cosmic story.
[2747.64 → 2749.64] That God is unfolding.
[2749.64 → 2753.44] And he's telling us that it is not the story of Rome.
[2753.44 → 2755.44] It is not the story of the Jews.
[2755.44 → 2757.44] Or of the Gentiles.
[2757.44 → 2759.44] But it is another story.
[2759.44 → 2761.44] A story about God.
[2761.44 → 2763.44] And about God's people.
[2763.44 → 2771.44] And why do you suppose Paul would begin his letter about the church with this story?
[2771.44 → 2775.24] It's because he's writing to people.
[2775.24 → 2776.24] Jews and Gentiles.
[2776.24 → 2781.24] Who understand themselves and one another as coming from completely different stories.
[2781.24 → 2785.24] And often mutually hostile stories.
[2785.24 → 2790.84] And he wants to show them that actually they share a story.
[2790.84 → 2792.84] They have a common story.
[2792.84 → 2798.24] And it is the true story that actually stands behind all of their other individual stories.
[2798.24 → 2802.24] It's the true story of the entire world.
[2802.24 → 2811.04] And he's saying that it is only when each person finds their place in this larger beautiful story of God.
[2811.04 → 2816.04] That they can live together as the people of God.
[2816.04 → 2820.04] So today all I want to do is I want to point out two things about this story that we see.
[2820.04 → 2824.04] The story of God and the church.
[2824.04 → 2829.04] And the first thing is that it is a story that begins with the God of love.
[2829.04 → 2832.54] And then secondly it's a story that ends with the people of love.
[2832.54 → 2837.04] But first a story that begins with the God of love.
[2837.04 → 2843.04] J.I. Packer in his book Knowing God said this.
[2843.04 → 2845.04] I have the quote there.
[2845.04 → 2847.04] J.I. Packer wrote,
[2847.04 → 2853.04] Knowing God is a relationship calculated to thrill a person's heart.
[2853.04 → 2855.04] Isn't that awesome?
[2855.04 → 2862.04] Knowing God is a relationship calculated to thrill a person's heart.
[2862.04 → 2875.04] And as Paul writes these words, his heart must have been thrilled by knowing God and knowing who he is and knowing his plan of redemption through Jesus Christ.
[2875.04 → 2883.04] And I say that because one thing that is really incredible about this passage is that in the original Greek verses 3 through 14,
[2883.04 → 2888.04] it's a long stretch that Ashley read for us, is one sentence.
[2888.04 → 2890.04] One sentence.
[2890.04 → 2895.04] Have you ever experienced something that is so over the top, that's so extraordinary and beautiful,
[2895.04 → 2900.04] that you just want to talk about everything that you're thinking and feeling?
[2900.04 → 2903.04] It's kind of like what Paul is going on with Paul here.
[2903.04 → 2909.04] It's this one, it's one of the most overwhelming passages in the entire New Testament.
[2909.04 → 2912.04] Like as Ashley read it for us, did you feel yourself overwhelmed?
[2912.04 → 2922.04] Paul talks about nearly all the great mysteries of the Christian faith.
[2922.04 → 2924.04] He talks about the Trinity.
[2924.04 → 2935.04] He talks about election, incarnation, crucifixion, faith, justification, sanctification, the nature of time itself, and the goal of human history.
[2935.04 → 2938.04] In one sentence.
[2938.04 → 2941.04] One scholar, William Hendrickson, said this,
[2941.04 → 2948.04] this passage is like a snowball tumbling down a hill, picking up volume, getting bigger as it descends.
[2948.04 → 2954.04] And it's this outpouring of praise to God who is the author of this story.
[2954.04 → 2957.04] So let's look at what Paul tells us about God.
[2957.04 → 2964.04] And did you notice that all the action in this passage is being done by God?
[2964.04 → 2966.04] God is the author.
[2966.04 → 2969.04] He is the one doing all of these things that Paul writes about.
[2969.04 → 2974.04] It's all done by God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[2974.04 → 2976.04] It's the story of the triune God.
[2976.04 → 2981.04] And so the story that Paul tells is a story that begins with this triune God of love.
[2981.04 → 2986.04] And we see that naturally in three ways, right?
[2986.04 → 2995.04] So first, it's a story that existed from all eternity in the love of the Father.
[2995.04 → 3004.04] One of the first things that Paul teaches us about this is that this story he's going to tell originates in the will of the Father.
[3004.04 → 3005.04] The Father's plan.
[3005.04 → 3009.04] And we see this in a few places in these verses.
[3009.04 → 3016.04] So in verse 1, Paul describes himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God.
[3016.04 → 3019.04] In verse 5, he says,
[3019.04 → 3028.04] In love, he predestined us for adoption to son ship through Jesus Christ in accordance with his pleasure and will.
[3028.04 → 3032.04] In other words, because he wanted to.
[3032.04 → 3037.04] In verse 9, he made known to us the mystery of his will.
[3037.04 → 3047.04] See, God has this eternal will and has planned everything in accordance to accomplish his will.
[3047.04 → 3054.04] So what I want us to see is that for Paul, the story of the world begins in the will and the plan of God the Father.
[3054.04 → 3058.04] This is where the story starts in this loving heart of the Father.
[3058.04 → 3063.04] But then, secondly, it's expressed through the love of the Son.
[3063.04 → 3070.04] And one of the main features of the letter to Ephesians is the centrality of Jesus.
[3070.04 → 3073.04] Yeah, put the next one on there for me.
[3073.04 → 3076.04] Expressed in the love of the Son, yeah.
[3076.04 → 3082.04] So in this passage alone, in these couple verses that we read, the phrase,
[3082.04 → 3088.04] In Christ, or in him, referring to Christ, occurs 11 times.
[3088.04 → 3095.04] In the book of Ephesians itself, it will occur nearly 40 times.
[3095.04 → 3099.04] And so whatever Ephesians is about, and there are different ways to understand Ephesians,
[3099.04 → 3101.04] and there's so much we can get out of it.
[3101.04 → 3105.04] But whatever it's about, it's about a lot of things, it is about Jesus.
[3105.04 → 3108.04] It is about Jesus.
[3108.04 → 3112.04] And we see this in this passage.
[3112.04 → 3114.04] In verse 3, it says,
[3114.04 → 3117.04] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3117.04 → 3124.04] who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[3124.04 → 3129.04] The blessings of the Father come to us in Christ.
[3129.04 → 3134.04] In verse 5, we're brought into the family of God through Christ.
[3134.04 → 3139.04] In verse 7, we have redemption and the forgiveness of our sins through Christ.
[3139.04 → 3142.04] In verse 9, God's will is revealed to us in Christ.
[3142.04 → 3145.04] In verse 10, all things are going to be reconciled in Christ.
[3145.04 → 3148.04] In verse 11, our inheritance is in Christ.
[3148.04 → 3153.04] Verse 12, we exist for the glory of Christ.
[3153.04 → 3160.04] Paul is being caught up in wonder, and he wants to overwhelm us with Christ.
[3160.04 → 3161.04] Do you see that?
[3161.04 → 3164.04] He wants to overwhelm us with Christ.
[3164.04 → 3180.04] And what he's saying is, Jews and Gentiles, your story is not most clearly expressed and seen in Judaism, or in the Gentile cultures, or in Rome.
[3180.04 → 3183.04] It is most clearly seen and expressed in Christ Jesus.
[3183.04 → 3188.04] God's story, the true story of the entire world, is about Jesus.
[3188.04 → 3195.04] And then there's this third aspect of the story, that it's a story experienced through the love of the Spirit.
[3195.04 → 3197.04] That's the third aspect.
[3197.04 → 3211.04] For Paul, while this story originates in the love of the Father, it's the Father's will to accomplish it, it's then expressed in the fullness of time by the coming of Jesus Christ, and all that he accomplishes for our salvation.
[3211.04 → 3220.04] It's actually then experienced by each one of us, you and me, through the love of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[3220.04 → 3224.04] And we see this all throughout this chapter, this passage.
[3224.04 → 3231.04] So in verse 3, Paul talks about how God has blessed us with spiritual blessings.
[3231.04 → 3233.04] What are spiritual blessings?
[3233.04 → 3239.04] What that means is that they are blessings that are found in and given to us by the Holy Spirit.
[3241.04 → 3250.04] Then later, at the end of the passage, verse 13, he says that we are all sealed, we are marked, we are stamped by the Holy Spirit.
[3250.04 → 3253.04] Each one of us.
[3253.04 → 3260.04] And then in verse 14, the Holy Spirit is the guarantee of our common inheritance.
[3260.04 → 3271.04] And so what he's saying is that this common story that you all share as Christians is a story that you can experience right now by the Holy Spirit.
[3271.04 → 3275.04] That he is with you, that he is doing this right now in your life.
[3275.04 → 3293.04] And so what he wants to see in this amazing passage is that Paul begins this letter of Ephesians by anchoring his readers, not in their Jewish stories, not in their Gentile stories, nor in the story that Rome is telling, but rather in God's story.
[3293.04 → 3296.04] Okay, this is the story of the story.
[3296.04 → 3297.04] Okay, this is the story of the story.
[3297.04 → 3299.04] He is the author of the story.
[3299.04 → 3300.04] He is the actor of the story.
[3300.04 → 3305.04] He is accomplishing his will through Jesus Christ and applied to us by the Holy Spirit.
[3305.04 → 3306.04] Right?
[3306.04 → 3310.04] And Paul is enthralled by this.
[3310.04 → 3319.04] But there's a second whole part of the story that Paul is talking about.
[3319.04 → 3331.04] And what Paul says is that it's a story that not only begins in the love of God, the triune God of love, but it's a story that culminates in the people of love, the church.
[3331.04 → 3336.04] And what he is saying is that we have a place in God's story.
[3336.04 → 3340.04] He chose us to receive his redemption.
[3340.04 → 3348.04] And so as we go through this passage, I didn't show the whole passage again, but look at all the pronouns.
[3348.04 → 3356.04] Maybe you have the passage in front of you, or go home and just look at all the pronouns, all of theare, the's, the US's.
[3356.04 → 3358.04] Let me just share a couple.
[3358.04 → 3366.04] In verse one, he refers to all of them as God's holy people, faithful in Christ Jesus.
[3366.04 → 3367.04] Right?
[3367.04 → 3370.04] Jew and Gentile alike, you are holy.
[3370.04 → 3372.04] You are faithful.
[3372.04 → 3375.04] In verse two, he says, grace and peace to you.
[3375.04 → 3386.04] Okay, now, one of the unfortunate things in the English language is that we don't distinguish between singular you and plural you all.
[3386.04 → 3387.04] Right?
[3387.04 → 3395.04] And this can get us into trouble when we read the Bible because we think often like we read the book of the letter of Ephesians, and naturally we read it as singular.
[3395.04 → 3397.04] Grace and peace to you.
[3397.04 → 3398.04] Well, thank you.
[3398.04 → 3399.04] Right?
[3399.04 → 3404.04] But if we read it that way, we're actually missing the point.
[3404.04 → 3408.04] The point is grace and peace to all of you.
[3408.04 → 3411.04] Grace and peace to all of you.
[3411.04 → 3416.04] And then in verse four, it says God has chosen all of them.
[3416.04 → 3421.04] Verse five, God has adopted all of them to be his sons and daughters.
[3421.04 → 3424.04] In verse seven, he has forgiven all of them.
[3424.04 → 3429.04] In verse nine, God has revealed himself to them in Jesus.
[3429.04 → 3441.04] In verse 12 and 13, he says that all of them, the Jews who were the first to believe, and then the Gentiles who would believe later, all of them have received the same Holy Spirit.
[3441.04 → 3444.04] So you read in the book of Acts, right?
[3444.04 → 3449.04] In the Holy Spirit, the gospel is going out to all these different peoples.
[3449.04 → 3450.04] Right?
[3450.04 → 3456.04] And then these people believe, and the Holy Spirit comes upon them.
[3456.04 → 3461.04] And some of the apostles go out, and they're like, well, we weren't expecting this.
[3461.04 → 3465.04] These people are very different from us, but they have the Holy Spirit too.
[3465.04 → 3468.04] Who are we to argue with that?
[3470.04 → 3472.04] All of them receive the same Holy Spirit.
[3472.04 → 3476.04] And in verse 14, all of them share the same inheritance.
[3476.04 → 3480.04] All of them are God's possession.
[3480.04 → 3482.04] We belong to God.
[3482.04 → 3486.04] You belong to God, and the person sitting next to you belongs to God.
[3487.04 → 3494.04] So Paul is writing this letter to the church, and he's reminding them of this story that they share together.
[3494.04 → 3496.04] And why does Paul do this?
[3496.04 → 3498.04] Why is Paul writing it this way?
[3498.04 → 3505.04] It's because he knows that it is very possible for people to believe
[3505.04 → 3508.04] that there is a God of love.
[3508.04 → 3509.04] Right?
[3509.04 → 3516.04] It is very possible for us today to talk about this God of love that we believe in.
[3516.04 → 3518.04] To pray about it.
[3518.04 → 3519.04] To sing about it.
[3519.04 → 3526.04] And yet, not believe that they or we actually have to love each other.
[3526.04 → 3533.04] But let's remember what Jesus told us in John chapter 13.
[3533.04 → 3535.04] This is what our Lord Jesus said.
[3535.04 → 3538.04] He said,
[3538.04 → 3540.04] A new command I give you.
[3540.04 → 3541.04] Love one another.
[3541.04 → 3545.04] As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
[3545.04 → 3552.04] By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.
[3552.04 → 3555.04] You know, things that are important are repeated.
[3555.04 → 3559.04] How many times does he say love one another?
[3559.04 → 3561.04] Three times, right?
[3561.04 → 3566.04] That's the challenge the churches were facing in Paul's day in the first century.
[3566.04 → 3567.04] Right?
[3567.04 → 3572.04] Jews and Gentiles, they both believed that God loved them in Jesus Christ.
[3572.04 → 3574.04] Well, that's how you become a Christian, right?
[3574.04 → 3577.04] That's why they were Christians.
[3577.04 → 3578.04] They believed that.
[3578.04 → 3581.04] But they didn't love one another.
[3581.04 → 3584.04] Instead, they were fighting with one another.
[3584.04 → 3586.04] And we see this throughout the New Testament.
[3586.04 → 3590.04] They're fighting with one another about food, about social status, about leadership.
[3590.04 → 3595.04] They're having conflicts about how God calls us to live, what he calls us to believe.
[3595.04 → 3604.04] And so, in order to lead them toward unity, Paul reminds them that the story that they share
[3604.04 → 3608.04] doesn't only just begin with this God of love whom they all believe in,
[3608.04 → 3615.04] but it actually, it culminates in being a people of love.
[3615.04 → 3618.04] And that's a little harder.
[3618.04 → 3623.04] And Paul begins the letter of Ephesians by saying that we can live together as one church
[3623.04 → 3627.04] when we see ourselves as part of a common story that we share.
[3627.04 → 3633.04] You know, we all have our own stories from our cultures, from our individual experiences.
[3633.04 → 3637.04] And sometimes when we come together, these cultures, these stories,
[3637.04 → 3642.04] if we anchor our primary identity in those stories, they are stories that can actually keep us apart.
[3642.04 → 3649.04] And Paul is saying we need to see ourselves as sharing a common story.
[3649.04 → 3654.04] So he's asking us to expand our imaginations in a new way.
[3654.04 → 3659.04] Right? To see ourselves and others not as opposing groups of people, but as one people.
[3659.04 → 3663.04] Right? Not as having different stories that set us apart from each other,
[3663.04 → 3667.04] but having one new and overwhelming story that brings us together.
[3667.04 → 3669.04] That's the gospel.
[3669.04 → 3679.04] So I want to ask us today, this morning, how do you imagine yourself?
[3679.04 → 3682.04] How do you imagine this church?
[3682.04 → 3692.04] Right? And when you imagine this church, and your place in it and our life together,
[3692.04 → 3696.04] in 10 years, what does your imagination see?
[3696.04 → 3699.04] Right? Do you see a Dutch church?
[3699.04 → 3702.04] Or do you see a Chinese church?
[3702.04 → 3706.04] Or do you see a multicultural church? Or an Iranian church?
[3706.04 → 3711.04] Who do you see in church leadership as elders and deacons?
[3711.04 → 3714.04] Right? What do you see?
[3714.04 → 3718.04] And the reason I'm asking this is that Paul is trying to expand our imaginations
[3718.04 → 3727.04] by helping us to see our individual stories as part of a larger and greater story of what God is doing in the church.
[3727.04 → 3733.04] Right? Far greater than sitting on a lawn chair being launched up into the air by balloons.
[3733.04 → 3748.04] We are being launched up into the heavenly places and given the opportunity to see the world from God's 16,000 foot view.
[3748.04 → 3762.04] And he's inviting each of us to have this new vision and to find our individual stories, our story as a church, within this larger story of God.
[3762.04 → 3774.04] The story that begins in the heart of the Father, is expressed through the Son, is experienced by each of us, by the Holy Spirit, that makes us into a new people of God.
[3774.04 → 3776.04] Let's pray together.
[3776.04 → 3784.04] God on high, hear our prayer.
[3784.04 → 3788.04] And bring us into the story that we long for.
[3788.04 → 3790.04] Bring us to Christ.
[3790.04 → 3792.04] Bring us together.
[3792.04 → 3795.04] In Jesus name we pray.
[3795.04 → 3796.04] Amen.
[3796.04 → 3803.04] So let's stand and let's sing our song of respect.
[3803.04 → 3805.04] And I'm going to tell you what it is.
[3805.04 → 3807.04] Oh yeah.
[3807.04 → 3809.04] The church is one foundation.
[3809.04 → 3811.04] It's different from what's in your bulletin.
[3811.04 → 3812.04] I changed it at the last minute.
[3812.04 → 3813.04] So it's my fault.
[3813.04 → 3815.04] The church is one foundation.
[3815.04 → 3816.04] Is Jesus Christ our Lord.
[3816.04 → 3817.04] Jesus is the creation.
[3817.04 → 3821.04] The church is one foundation.

[3876.14 → 3884.74] Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one earth.
[3885.28 → 3893.18] One holy name she blesses, or takes one holy food,
[3893.68 → 3901.68] And to one hope she passes, with every grace and truth.
[3901.68 → 3910.68] In toil and tribulation, and to all suffer more,
[3911.72 → 3918.68] She makes the conservation of peace forevermore,
[3920.10 → 3928.08] Till with the vision glorious, her loving eyes are blessed,
[3928.08 → 3937.08] And the great church victorious, shall be the church at rest.
[3939.08 → 3947.08] And she on earth has union, with God the three in one,
[3948.08 → 3956.26] And mystics in communion, with those whose rest is one.

[3961.02 → 3964.26] Lord, give us grace that we,
[3965.36 → 3969.52] Like them, the weak and lowly,
[3969.88 → 3973.14] May live eternally.
[3981.26 → 3982.88] Go ahead and be seated.
[3982.88 → 3996.16] All right, so we will continue to worship the Lord by giving our tithes and offerings,
[3996.40 → 4003.80] And the designated mission ministry that we support for this Sunday is Resonate Global Mission.

[4125.16 → 4128.54] for the world, for our church, for ourselves before the Lord.
[4128.54 → 4132.54] Please join me in this prayer.
[4132.54 → 4140.88] Our loving God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you, and we praise you for
[4140.88 → 4147.92] raising Jesus from the dead, the first fruits of your new creation, and for sending your
[4147.92 → 4157.24] Spirit that we too may have this new life in Christ, new resurrected life.
[4157.24 → 4163.36] We thank and praise you for the power and the promise of your Holy Spirit to lead and guide
[4163.36 → 4172.24] us in all our ways, both individually, as families, and as a church community.
[4172.24 → 4175.00] Help us to live in accordance with your Spirit.
[4175.00 → 4181.80] Lord, help us to follow the leading of your Spirit wherever it goes, setting our minds on
[4181.80 → 4189.42] what the Spirit desires, whose desire is one with the Father and the Son, the triune God,
[4189.42 → 4196.68] so that we may joyfully be alive in Christ.
[4196.68 → 4202.92] We thank and praise you that the Spirit testifies to us that we are your children, and that through
[4202.92 → 4210.60] your Spirit we can approach you with confidence as our compassionate Father who hears our prayers,
[4210.60 → 4214.68] who inclines, Lord, your ear to us.
[4214.68 → 4220.76] Lord, comfort us with the knowledge that your Spirit also helps us in our weaknesses and intercedes
[4220.76 → 4226.52] for us according to your will, Lord, because sometimes our prayers are so weak we don't know
[4226.52 → 4230.36] what to pray as we ought.
[4230.36 → 4235.40] Father, there are many things on our hearts as we come before you this morning, Lord, especially
[4235.40 → 4238.92] for people in our own church community.
[4238.92 → 4244.52] Lord, we pray for Perry and Angela, as we just found out this morning that Angela's dad had a
[4244.52 → 4247.72] massive heart attack and has passed away.
[4247.72 → 4253.88] Lord, would you comfort Angela, especially, Lord, to be with their family.
[4253.88 → 4257.80] We're in here and wherever they are, Lord, as they go and they gather together.
[4259.80 → 4263.32] Lord, would you bind up broken hearts.
[4263.96 → 4267.80] Would you be present, Lord, with the peace that you provide.
[4269.48 → 4277.40] Lord, we also pray for young Richie, who is still in the Children's Hospital in Vancouver,
[4277.40 → 4280.92] undergoing many tests for very serious medical problems.
[4280.92 → 4285.64] Lord, would you be with their parents, Cody and Tara, with the grandparents.
[4287.88 → 4291.48] And Lord, would you just have your mercy upon them.
[4291.48 → 4297.32] Lord, be with Rick and Roberta and be with all of their family, Lord, as they seek you and
[4297.32 → 4300.28] they lift their cries to you for your healing help.
[4301.16 → 4305.48] Lord, we pray for Janet, who is still in Delta Hospital.
[4305.48 → 4309.00] Lord, we pray that you would give her a full recovery.
[4310.04 → 4314.52] And Lord, remember Ellie as well, who, Lord, still is recovering from a broken hip
[4315.24 → 4318.60] and also adjusting to living in a new facility in White Rock.
[4319.24 → 4321.08] Lord, would you be with these.
[4321.08 → 4328.36] Also with Pat Bowman, who needs wisdom from the doctors, also about when and if to have a surgery that
[4328.36 → 4329.32] might be needed.
[4329.32 → 4332.36] But there are complications with other medical health problems.
[4333.16 → 4336.04] Lord, would you guide her doctors and guide her.
[4337.56 → 4339.88] Lord, for all of these things, Lord, we look to you.
[4340.68 → 4348.04] And Lord, when we look around the world, there's still so much pain, suffering and conflict.
[4348.92 → 4351.32] Lord, we cry out to you as the Prince of Peace.
[4351.32 → 4360.52] Lord, would you be with those who have lost children, family members, loved ones in the United States
[4360.52 → 4362.20] because of recent mass shootings.
[4363.32 → 4372.52] Lord, would you give wisdom, hearts of compassion to leaders and as a country, as they discuss what it means,
[4373.24 → 4376.92] Lord, to reduce gun violence in the country.
[4377.80 → 4385.16] Lord, we ask that you'd be with the people of Ukraine as the war continues to drag on, not knowing when the end may be in sight.
[4385.88 → 4393.24] Lord, sustain all those who are caught up in much turmoil.
[4394.36 → 4397.64] Lord, we ask for wisdom of world leaders.
[4398.68 → 4405.24] Lord, that together we might seek the peace that ultimately, Lord, only comes through you through the Gospel.
[4407.88 → 4413.62] Lord, we pray that you'd be with students and teachers in these last couple weeks before the end of the semester.
[4415.32 → 4418.12] And Lord, would you be with so many needs in this world.
[4419.40 → 4424.60] And Lord, for all the things also that each one of us brings and bears to you.
[4424.60 → 4430.20] Lord, we each have struggles in our own lives.
[4431.48 → 4438.00] But Lord, you promised and said to us, take comfort because I, our Lord Jesus, has overcome the world.
[4438.76 → 4443.68] And Lord, we know your promise that one day you will return to renew all things.
[4443.68 → 4452.06] So we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns, Father, with you in the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
[4452.96 → 4453.30] Amen.
[4453.30 → 4457.54] Please rise.
[4458.26 → 4466.18] And as we prepare to go out from here, we go with the blessing of our Heavenly Father upon us, his children.
[4466.62 → 4470.10] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4471.10 → 4476.30] May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him,
[4476.92 → 4481.36] so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[4481.36 → 4482.48] Amen.
[4482.48 → 4482.62] Amen.
