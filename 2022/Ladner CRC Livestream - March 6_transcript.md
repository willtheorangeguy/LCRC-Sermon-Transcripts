[0.00 --> 4.76]  and agreed to preach. I looked in the camera, I said, oh, this is the first Sunday of Lent. So I
[4.76 --> 12.56]  emailed Pastor Jason, or I asked through email, I may not have been him directly,
[13.22 --> 17.54]  are you doing a series for Lent? And so he said, yeah, we're doing the seven words,
[18.00 --> 24.34]  pick whichever one you want, which was very kind of him. So the order isn't exactly the same,
[24.34 --> 30.44]  but I thought this one would be the least disruptive. And I chose the words of Jesus
[30.44 --> 43.64]  to his mother from the cross, accorded in John 19. And the order isn't as important as the
[43.64 --> 53.04]  significance of each of the sayings. So here's John 19, beginning at verse 17. And the verses
[54.34 --> 65.18]  25 to 7 are the key ones. Carrying his own cross, Jesus went out to the place of the skull,
[65.34 --> 71.88]  which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him and with him two others,
[71.88 --> 80.50]  one on each side and Jesus in the middle. Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross.
[80.50 --> 88.30]  It read, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. Many of the Jews read this sign for the place where
[88.30 --> 94.74]  Jesus was crucified was near the city. And the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.
[95.36 --> 100.94]  The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, do not write the King of the Jews,
[101.34 --> 106.50]  but that this man claimed to be King of the Jews. Pilate answered,
[106.50 --> 136.48]  Pilate said,
[136.50 --> 138.08]  Pilate said,
[138.08 --> 142.92]  He said,
[142.92 --> 145.74]  He said,
[145.74 --> 151.16]  they divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.
[153.86 --> 160.26]  So this is what the soldiers did. Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother. His mother's sister,
[160.26 --> 168.58]  mother, his mother's sister, Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
[170.10 --> 176.66]  When Jesus saw his mother there and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her,
[177.46 --> 185.78]  Woman, here is your son, and to the disciple, here is your mother.
[185.78 --> 192.82]  From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
[194.96 --> 204.66]  Well, family of God, brothers and sisters in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the very normal
[204.66 --> 210.24]  order of things, a parent dies before a child.
[210.24 --> 219.12]  So it's not very likely, but it does happen, and it may have happened to you, that a son
[219.12 --> 226.00]  or daughter ends up in a similar situation that Jesus found himself in, where he's dying
[226.00 --> 232.60]  as the eldest son responsible for his mother, and he needs to care for her.
[232.60 --> 243.42]  Now, what does normally happen is that parents need to decide what they will do for their
[243.42 --> 247.38]  children in the likely or unlikely event, rather, that they die.
[248.10 --> 250.16]  I mean, that's what wills are for.
[250.36 --> 258.72]  We need to decide who will care for our children, which close relative, or might it have to be
[258.72 --> 262.52]  a friend that will step in in case we die.
[264.32 --> 273.70]  Now, we, my wife Lynn and I, can somewhat identify with Jesus in that we had a difficult decision
[273.70 --> 279.06]  to make when my father, Cecil Tuninga, former pastor of this church, died.
[279.06 --> 286.08]  We were in Winnipeg at the time, and after Dad's funeral, we realized that there was not
[286.08 --> 291.16]  one of us children that lived even remotely close to my mom.
[292.38 --> 296.32]  So who would be there for her in her failing years?
[296.46 --> 298.12]  She was 93 at the time.
[299.60 --> 304.52]  One of my brothers, I'll mention his name because some of you will remember Don, he and his wife
[304.52 --> 308.80]  had already, they thought, sold their house and were on the way to Edmonton to move and
[308.80 --> 311.54]  help out, and the realtor said, sorry, it fell through.
[311.70 --> 315.08]  And as it turned out, it didn't work out well for them.
[315.18 --> 325.06]  So my wife Lynn and I got what we thought was the call to go to Edmonton, and I asked permission
[325.06 --> 328.14]  for the church in Winnipeg, Covenant, to leave.
[328.92 --> 338.38]  And that move in spending seven of mom's last years in Edmonton was a tremendous blessing in our lives.
[338.80 --> 348.84]  Jesus, from the cross, is taking care of the business of his mother before he dies.
[349.08 --> 357.30]  He's kind of putting his last will and testament in order, and he's making sure that when he's
[357.30 --> 362.74]  gone, someone will be there to properly care for him.
[362.74 --> 368.20]  He's showing how much he cares from the cross.
[369.52 --> 373.06]  John is the only gospel that catches this.
[374.36 --> 380.92]  Now perhaps to avoid drawing undue attention to himself, he describes himself as the disciple
[380.92 --> 382.46]  whom Jesus loved.
[382.46 --> 391.20]  John's the disciple who writes so much about love, and he was so very close to Jesus.
[392.18 --> 394.10]  A deep trust had developed.
[395.04 --> 401.90]  It is John in particular in his gospel also who shows how Jesus is both God and man.
[402.02 --> 408.92]  He begins his gospel by showing how he's the word that created this vast creation that's
[408.92 --> 411.72]  come into the flesh for our sake.
[411.82 --> 415.72]  He's the God through whom the world was made.
[415.82 --> 424.58]  At the end of his gospel, he has this confession of Jesus, my Lord and my God.
[424.58 --> 438.22]  And John is also the one who captures little human details, like his clothing and who takes
[438.22 --> 440.34]  care of his mother.
[442.66 --> 448.42]  It's a little hard for us, I think, to imagine the scene around the cross.
[448.42 --> 452.26]  There's some value in trying, at least.
[453.34 --> 456.58]  There are those four Roman soldiers.
[458.02 --> 463.44]  They've been assigned to the task of putting Jesus on the cross.
[464.84 --> 474.18]  Soldiers, police, are often given tasks, put in positions where they simply have to carry
[474.18 --> 477.80]  out the orders that they get from their superiors.
[478.98 --> 485.96]  We know there was one around the cross, the centurion, who realized in the end this was a
[485.96 --> 486.92]  great injustice.
[487.78 --> 489.26]  This was an innocent man.
[490.56 --> 497.18]  But apparently these four soldiers haven't had to exercise or didn't such discernment skills.
[498.24 --> 501.68]  They're, shall we say, part of the regime.
[501.68 --> 508.76]  They're doing their work, it seems, quite happily as they roll the dice.
[509.10 --> 515.18]  They gamble over what is their legitimate booty, the clothing of Jesus.
[515.94 --> 524.12]  One for each of them, except that inner garment, which is really a tunic.
[524.12 --> 533.30]  Not your average piece of clothing, because like the priest's clothing in the Old Testament,
[533.54 --> 539.26]  it is woven in one piece from top to bottom.
[540.58 --> 546.74]  You see, John is saying the one that they're crucifying is not only the king of the Jews,
[546.74 --> 558.68]  but he's the priest, or as he says earlier in his gospel, the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[558.68 --> 566.36]  So here are these four soldiers doing their job, and there are four women as well.
[567.70 --> 574.60]  Their lives have been touched, well, really changed by Jesus.
[575.50 --> 578.54]  And they've followed him throughout his life.
[579.44 --> 580.56]  They've cared for him.
[580.56 --> 582.98]  There's the mother of Jesus.
[584.66 --> 587.62]  There's her sister, or Jesus' aunt.
[588.32 --> 593.46]  We know from the other gospels it's Salome, or the mother of James and John.
[595.38 --> 597.98]  There's Mary, the wife of Clopas.
[598.06 --> 599.40]  We don't know who she is.
[599.52 --> 606.70]  And there's Mary Magdalene, the woman out of whom Jesus cast seven evil spirits.
[606.70 --> 616.16]  And these four women, for varying reasons, not only love Jesus, but they believe in him.
[617.10 --> 622.26]  And they're willing to risk their lives being there.
[623.42 --> 630.00]  They are a testimony to this truth, that love casts out fear.
[630.00 --> 639.12]  Surely these women must have wondered, why is Jesus on that cross?
[640.22 --> 641.54]  They do not know.
[643.42 --> 646.78]  They are not standing there thinking theologically.
[647.08 --> 650.76]  You know, Jesus is here dying for the sins of his people.
[651.40 --> 654.96]  They're not saying, oh, what a good Friday this is.
[654.96 --> 662.82]  Our sins are going to be taken care of, and in a couple days he's going to rise from the dead, and we're going to rise with him.
[663.10 --> 665.26]  Won't that be a glorious day?
[666.88 --> 667.36]  No.
[668.10 --> 670.24]  That's not how they're thinking.
[671.90 --> 675.78]  To them, this is a senseless crucifixion.
[676.74 --> 678.04]  It's immoral.
[678.04 --> 679.04]  It's illegal.
[679.04 --> 680.22]  It's illegal.
[681.22 --> 687.32]  An act carried out by both the religious and the political authorities.
[688.44 --> 696.02]  Simply because they didn't want anyone challenging their ideology and their authority.
[697.44 --> 703.98]  You know, people who enjoy power will do anything to squelch dissidents.
[705.16 --> 706.38]  We see it today.
[706.38 --> 713.90]  Here's Jesus, however, willing, as it were, to take it on the chin.
[715.06 --> 723.70]  He's in immense pain, and he has every reason to complain, to lash out, because this is simply unfair.
[725.30 --> 732.64]  But he's accepting this as the Father's way of dealing with human injustice.
[732.64 --> 736.48]  Oh, he wished there could be another way.
[737.38 --> 740.46]  Lord, would you please take this cup from me?
[740.54 --> 743.06]  But no, this is God's way.
[743.06 --> 749.12]  And so it's in obedience that Jesus is on this cross.
[750.12 --> 759.50]  And while he's doing it, he's exposing and disarming the powers and authorities that be,
[760.78 --> 764.76]  while providing for the salvation of the world.
[764.76 --> 765.76]  He's doing it.
[765.76 --> 766.76]  He's doing it.
[766.76 --> 767.76]  He's doing it.
[767.76 --> 768.76]  He's doing it.
[768.76 --> 769.88]  But we could go further.
[769.88 --> 774.58]  We want to focus our attention now on the mother of Jesus.
[774.58 --> 778.24]  Her name isn't mentioned in the Gospel of John.
[778.36 --> 781.18]  She's defined by her role.
[781.18 --> 794.58]  Remember, this is the mom who already, when she was very young, was treasuring what she knew about Jesus
[794.58 --> 798.44]  and storing these things up in her heart.
[798.44 --> 809.74]  This is the mother who, at the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Cana, already recognizing that he's a special boy,
[811.94 --> 813.92]  said to them, go talk to Jesus.
[814.06 --> 815.22]  He can fix your problem.
[815.40 --> 819.16]  And Jesus said to her, woman, why get me involved?
[819.62 --> 821.12]  My hour has not come.
[821.12 --> 828.54]  This is the mother who, with her other boys, her sons, had once thinking,
[828.92 --> 833.68]  it's getting to Jesus, this ministry, and went and knocking on the door of this house he was in.
[834.28 --> 836.16]  And he didn't even go to the door and answer.
[836.26 --> 839.60]  He simply said to those in the crowd, and the message got out,
[839.82 --> 842.10]  who is my mother and who are my brothers?
[844.12 --> 845.92]  Here are my mother and brothers.
[846.82 --> 850.06]  Whoever does the Father's will.
[851.12 --> 855.38]  is my mother and brother and sister.
[857.60 --> 861.78]  Well, Jesus' hour has come.
[862.82 --> 864.44]  He's gone public.
[864.86 --> 868.22]  You might say he has stepped up to the plate,
[868.40 --> 873.56]  and he's ready to take now whatever the authorities will throw at him.
[873.56 --> 877.48]  And there in the stands is Mary,
[878.60 --> 880.46]  with nothing to cheer about.
[881.12 --> 883.04]  But so help me.
[883.62 --> 884.48]  She's a mother.
[885.26 --> 887.38]  She will be true to her son,
[887.60 --> 890.92]  like any mother would be to her son,
[891.18 --> 894.70]  even if he was accused of being a criminal.
[894.70 --> 899.88]  And from the cross, Jesus looks down,
[900.04 --> 902.98]  and he sees his mother, heartbroken,
[903.62 --> 904.82]  surely weeping,
[906.02 --> 908.16]  probably inconsolably,
[908.54 --> 911.02]  and he's moved with compassion,
[911.74 --> 913.72]  imagining her confusion
[913.72 --> 917.26]  and the desolation that's filling her soul.
[917.26 --> 921.18]  Her husband Joseph is gone.
[921.18 --> 924.64]  We don't find out whatever happened to him,
[924.76 --> 925.52]  so that night,
[925.76 --> 927.82]  she's going to go home,
[928.76 --> 929.30]  alone,
[930.18 --> 932.32]  no one to comfort her.
[933.60 --> 935.70]  Life will not be easy for her.
[935.70 --> 938.92]  And there he looks,
[939.04 --> 940.00]  and there's John.
[942.12 --> 944.68]  Oh, the one he so loved and trusted,
[945.56 --> 948.12]  the one he knew he could rely on,
[949.44 --> 951.42]  evidenced by the fact that he's there.
[951.42 --> 953.86]  He's the only one of the twelve
[953.86 --> 956.38]  standing near the cross,
[957.18 --> 959.74]  courageous enough to show up.
[959.74 --> 963.80]  And so Jesus, in love,
[964.40 --> 965.54]  from that cross,
[965.72 --> 966.82]  speaks to his mother.
[968.48 --> 969.20]  Woman,
[970.30 --> 972.70]  behold, look,
[974.18 --> 975.12]  see your son.
[978.46 --> 979.84]  Woman there is,
[980.34 --> 981.50]  in our language,
[981.72 --> 982.72]  it sounds rude,
[982.94 --> 984.48]  but it's endearing term.
[984.60 --> 986.32]  It really is my dear lady.
[986.32 --> 990.90]  Perhaps Jesus is being legal at this point,
[991.00 --> 991.60]  because, you know,
[991.68 --> 993.90]  when you're using legal language,
[994.00 --> 995.34]  you don't talk personally.
[996.64 --> 998.18]  Maybe he's doing his,
[998.18 --> 999.76]  you know,
[999.82 --> 1001.82]  his will from the cross,
[1001.88 --> 1003.70]  as he's being responsible
[1003.70 --> 1004.82]  as the oldest son.
[1005.68 --> 1007.36]  Woman, here's your son.
[1008.18 --> 1009.90]  And then he turns to John,
[1010.06 --> 1011.32]  and he says to him,
[1011.74 --> 1012.90]  look, or see,
[1014.04 --> 1015.30]  behold your mother.
[1016.32 --> 1021.54]  John knew what Jesus meant,
[1022.44 --> 1024.64]  and from that time,
[1024.76 --> 1026.28]  he assumed responsibility
[1026.28 --> 1028.18]  for Mary.
[1029.68 --> 1031.18]  And later that afternoon,
[1032.16 --> 1033.62]  surely they walked away
[1033.62 --> 1037.44]  from that execution site together.
[1037.44 --> 1044.16]  We learn from this story,
[1044.92 --> 1047.02]  we learn from our Lord,
[1047.96 --> 1050.22]  as he speaks through his actions
[1050.22 --> 1052.88]  and words from the cross,
[1053.16 --> 1056.10]  that we too are to care
[1056.10 --> 1057.38]  for our family,
[1057.84 --> 1058.72]  in particular,
[1059.84 --> 1060.64]  our parents.
[1060.64 --> 1065.48]  All of us are sons and daughters.
[1066.54 --> 1068.48]  Not all of us have parents anymore,
[1068.68 --> 1070.02]  but we're called always,
[1070.70 --> 1071.98]  while we still have them,
[1072.16 --> 1073.30]  to love them,
[1074.48 --> 1075.40]  and care for them.
[1076.56 --> 1077.90]  It will happen inevitably
[1077.90 --> 1080.14]  that they misunderstand us
[1080.14 --> 1083.14]  or disapprove of things that we do,
[1083.14 --> 1086.82]  and sometimes we can hurt our parents
[1086.82 --> 1088.54]  and sometimes our parents
[1088.54 --> 1089.70]  can hurt us,
[1089.92 --> 1091.46]  even grievously.
[1091.82 --> 1095.38]  Sometimes parents can be so cruel,
[1095.58 --> 1096.84]  even abusive,
[1097.10 --> 1098.24]  that it's necessary
[1098.24 --> 1100.96]  to take distance from them.
[1102.44 --> 1105.08]  Yet we're called always to love them
[1105.08 --> 1107.98]  and to pray for them,
[1109.04 --> 1110.42]  and if possible,
[1111.50 --> 1112.56]  to care for them.
[1114.58 --> 1115.74]  Jesus was misunderstood
[1115.74 --> 1117.20]  by his family,
[1118.22 --> 1119.52]  including his mother.
[1121.42 --> 1123.72]  Yet he loved her deeply
[1123.72 --> 1125.40]  and cared for her.
[1127.08 --> 1128.36]  But there's something else
[1128.36 --> 1130.10]  Jesus is doing from the cross,
[1130.22 --> 1132.10]  something more significant.
[1132.32 --> 1134.66]  I believe he's letting his mother know
[1134.66 --> 1139.52]  that she's now to view him differently,
[1140.50 --> 1143.02]  no longer as her son,
[1143.94 --> 1145.56]  but as her savior.
[1147.56 --> 1149.82]  He addresses her as a woman
[1149.82 --> 1152.14]  because she's no longer
[1152.14 --> 1155.48]  to view herself as his mother,
[1156.32 --> 1159.02]  but actually as she becomes
[1159.02 --> 1161.70]  one of his disciples.
[1161.70 --> 1166.68]  Jesus is not being rude.
[1167.44 --> 1169.62]  This is a defining moment,
[1169.72 --> 1170.74]  as we call it.
[1170.90 --> 1171.54]  He's saying,
[1172.06 --> 1173.06]  your task,
[1173.36 --> 1175.06]  as my mother is over,
[1175.44 --> 1176.96]  you're no longer my mom.
[1177.56 --> 1181.08]  You're now simply among all those
[1181.08 --> 1183.26]  for whom I am dying.
[1183.26 --> 1186.78]  And then,
[1187.42 --> 1188.84]  in sync with that,
[1188.90 --> 1191.30]  and it may strike us as odd,
[1191.40 --> 1193.50]  as it would have any Jewish observer,
[1194.34 --> 1196.42]  Jesus does not turn his mother over
[1196.42 --> 1197.68]  to his younger brother,
[1198.50 --> 1199.50]  the one under him,
[1200.50 --> 1203.08]  but to somebody outside the family.
[1203.08 --> 1208.48]  What about the other sons?
[1209.66 --> 1210.48]  His brothers?
[1212.12 --> 1213.56]  It was their legal duty.
[1215.30 --> 1216.14]  Well, yes,
[1216.76 --> 1218.84]  but here's the crux of the matter.
[1219.80 --> 1221.08]  We know from John
[1221.08 --> 1222.36]  that at this point,
[1222.52 --> 1224.70]  his brothers do not believe in him.
[1225.98 --> 1228.66]  Later in the book of Acts,
[1228.92 --> 1229.76]  they end up,
[1230.54 --> 1231.48]  his brothers do,
[1231.48 --> 1233.00]  joining the church.
[1234.86 --> 1236.02]  And so this situation
[1236.02 --> 1237.04]  brings us back
[1237.04 --> 1238.74]  to the one we started with.
[1240.02 --> 1241.50]  When it's time
[1241.50 --> 1243.34]  to turn your dad or mom
[1243.34 --> 1245.88]  over to someone else's care,
[1246.88 --> 1249.92]  who do you turn them over to?
[1252.12 --> 1252.74]  You know,
[1252.80 --> 1253.90]  I could digress here
[1253.90 --> 1254.72]  for some time,
[1254.82 --> 1256.56]  but if there's a regret
[1256.56 --> 1258.42]  I or we have
[1258.42 --> 1260.14]  is that we turned our mom
[1260.14 --> 1261.86]  over to a home
[1261.86 --> 1263.50]  in the last half year
[1263.50 --> 1263.98]  of her life
[1263.98 --> 1265.46]  that was not a Christian home
[1265.46 --> 1267.28]  and the conditions
[1267.28 --> 1268.16]  were not good.
[1271.64 --> 1273.64]  Jesus turns his mom
[1273.64 --> 1274.82]  over to the care
[1274.82 --> 1275.66]  of the one
[1275.66 --> 1277.26]  he knows
[1277.26 --> 1278.48]  and trusts
[1278.48 --> 1280.42]  will care for her
[1280.42 --> 1282.16]  in the right way.
[1284.08 --> 1285.40]  Mom, here's John.
[1285.40 --> 1287.76]  treat him like he's
[1287.76 --> 1288.94]  your eldest son
[1288.94 --> 1290.26]  and let him care for you
[1290.26 --> 1292.82]  and watch how he cares
[1292.82 --> 1293.50]  for you
[1293.50 --> 1295.28]  as I have
[1295.28 --> 1297.00]  with a love
[1297.00 --> 1298.56]  that is from above.
[1299.66 --> 1300.46]  He'll love you
[1300.46 --> 1301.22]  like his son.
[1302.62 --> 1303.28]  And John,
[1304.00 --> 1305.06]  care for her mom
[1305.06 --> 1308.16]  as if she was your own.
[1309.54 --> 1310.70]  And he does.
[1310.70 --> 1315.04]  I believe Jesus
[1315.04 --> 1316.08]  is here
[1316.08 --> 1318.04]  redefining
[1318.04 --> 1319.50]  what it means
[1319.50 --> 1321.26]  to be family
[1321.26 --> 1324.08]  and at the same time
[1324.08 --> 1326.22]  he's giving
[1326.22 --> 1328.16]  eternal significance
[1328.16 --> 1329.08]  to what
[1329.08 --> 1331.04]  we who are in
[1331.04 --> 1332.66]  our natural families
[1332.66 --> 1333.52]  are called
[1333.52 --> 1334.36]  to be and do.
[1336.98 --> 1338.78]  God's family is
[1338.78 --> 1340.34]  as Jesus said earlier
[1340.34 --> 1341.96]  in his earthly ministry
[1341.96 --> 1343.42]  all those children
[1343.42 --> 1344.10]  of his
[1344.10 --> 1344.84]  who do
[1344.84 --> 1345.66]  the will
[1345.66 --> 1346.58]  of the father
[1346.58 --> 1348.42]  which Jesus
[1348.42 --> 1349.40]  helps us to do.
[1350.86 --> 1351.92]  And that's why
[1351.92 --> 1353.12]  there's no greater
[1353.12 --> 1354.74]  care for
[1354.74 --> 1356.22]  that we can
[1356.22 --> 1358.06]  give to our family
[1358.06 --> 1359.50]  than to show
[1359.50 --> 1361.08]  and be for them
[1361.08 --> 1362.72]  who Jesus is.
[1366.06 --> 1367.58]  Now this is not
[1367.58 --> 1368.04]  or at least
[1368.04 --> 1368.82]  it need not
[1368.82 --> 1369.48]  be a matter
[1369.48 --> 1370.88]  of either or.
[1371.00 --> 1371.58]  In other words
[1371.58 --> 1371.86]  you know
[1371.86 --> 1372.82]  I'm either part
[1372.82 --> 1374.24]  of the fleshly family
[1374.24 --> 1375.56]  this is my family
[1375.56 --> 1377.80]  or this is my family.
[1378.42 --> 1379.48]  It's put that way
[1379.48 --> 1380.04]  for some
[1380.04 --> 1381.50]  and in some cultures
[1381.50 --> 1382.80]  if you become
[1382.80 --> 1383.44]  a Christian
[1383.44 --> 1384.24]  the family
[1384.24 --> 1385.50]  puts you out.
[1386.36 --> 1387.56]  But the design
[1387.56 --> 1388.14]  of God
[1388.14 --> 1389.44]  from the very beginning
[1389.44 --> 1390.08]  is that
[1390.08 --> 1391.64]  human flesh
[1391.64 --> 1392.86]  and divine spirit
[1392.86 --> 1393.74]  would always be
[1393.74 --> 1394.54]  one beginning
[1394.54 --> 1395.94]  in our families.
[1396.18 --> 1396.84]  In other words
[1396.84 --> 1397.86]  there's no more
[1397.86 --> 1399.34]  desired thing
[1399.34 --> 1400.76]  than that as we're
[1400.76 --> 1401.98]  brought into this world
[1401.98 --> 1403.06]  we're given parents
[1403.06 --> 1404.12]  who teach us
[1404.12 --> 1405.50]  how to trust
[1405.50 --> 1406.30]  and obey
[1406.30 --> 1407.94]  the Lord Jesus
[1407.94 --> 1410.56]  and who nurture us
[1410.56 --> 1411.84]  in whose love
[1411.84 --> 1412.98]  and in the truth
[1412.98 --> 1414.06]  of God's word.
[1416.28 --> 1417.94]  Earthly families
[1417.94 --> 1419.22]  are God's
[1419.22 --> 1420.86]  primary means
[1420.86 --> 1421.56]  for us
[1421.56 --> 1422.80]  to experience
[1422.80 --> 1424.26]  and be drawn
[1424.26 --> 1427.32]  into God's family.
[1429.88 --> 1431.00]  So Jesus
[1431.00 --> 1432.30]  makes it
[1432.30 --> 1433.50]  very clear
[1433.50 --> 1434.80]  that his disciples
[1434.80 --> 1436.36]  like with
[1436.36 --> 1437.72]  Mary and John
[1437.72 --> 1438.50]  are to put
[1438.50 --> 1439.28]  commitment
[1439.28 --> 1440.98]  to him
[1440.98 --> 1443.12]  over
[1443.12 --> 1444.44]  family
[1444.44 --> 1446.18]  relationships.
[1448.18 --> 1449.80]  Now there's a caveat
[1449.80 --> 1450.42]  to that
[1450.42 --> 1453.30]  because sometimes
[1453.30 --> 1454.00]  it happens
[1454.00 --> 1454.60]  that those
[1454.60 --> 1455.64]  there are those
[1455.64 --> 1456.60]  who can use
[1456.60 --> 1457.22]  devotion
[1457.22 --> 1459.38]  to church
[1459.38 --> 1460.30]  faith
[1460.30 --> 1461.58]  or even
[1461.58 --> 1462.14]  perhaps
[1462.14 --> 1463.04]  Christ
[1463.04 --> 1465.16]  as
[1465.16 --> 1466.14]  an excuse
[1466.14 --> 1467.30]  to not
[1467.30 --> 1467.96]  care
[1467.96 --> 1469.22]  for their families.
[1469.40 --> 1470.20]  Jesus addressed
[1470.20 --> 1470.60]  that
[1470.60 --> 1471.70]  in his gospel
[1471.70 --> 1473.28]  and he says
[1473.28 --> 1474.82]  no you can't
[1474.82 --> 1475.94]  use religion
[1475.94 --> 1476.80]  ever
[1476.80 --> 1477.84]  ever as a way
[1477.84 --> 1478.68]  to get out
[1478.68 --> 1479.12]  of your
[1479.12 --> 1479.94]  responsibility
[1479.94 --> 1481.48]  for caring
[1481.48 --> 1482.70]  for your family.
[1482.84 --> 1483.40]  That would be
[1483.40 --> 1484.54]  false religion.
[1485.74 --> 1486.54]  Anyone who is
[1486.54 --> 1487.42]  in Christ
[1487.42 --> 1488.74]  will love
[1488.74 --> 1489.82]  those who are
[1489.82 --> 1490.56]  around them
[1490.56 --> 1491.52]  at all points
[1491.52 --> 1492.18]  in time.
[1493.10 --> 1494.50]  But at the same
[1494.50 --> 1495.42]  time
[1495.42 --> 1496.90]  our faith
[1496.90 --> 1497.72]  in Jesus
[1497.72 --> 1499.22]  is never
[1499.22 --> 1500.18]  to give
[1500.18 --> 1503.08]  our being
[1503.08 --> 1504.58]  in the fleshly
[1504.58 --> 1505.22]  family
[1505.22 --> 1506.42]  priority
[1506.42 --> 1508.26]  over being
[1508.26 --> 1508.96]  in the
[1508.96 --> 1509.86]  spiritual
[1509.86 --> 1510.54]  or heavenly
[1510.54 --> 1510.90]  one.
[1512.98 --> 1513.68]  Our
[1513.68 --> 1514.16]  obedience
[1514.16 --> 1514.90]  to Christ
[1514.90 --> 1515.96]  must always
[1515.96 --> 1516.84]  be primary
[1516.84 --> 1518.06]  and not
[1518.06 --> 1518.48]  to our
[1518.48 --> 1519.08]  parents
[1519.08 --> 1520.32]  secondary
[1520.32 --> 1522.50]  as with
[1522.50 --> 1522.94]  all in
[1522.94 --> 1523.42]  authority.
[1525.28 --> 1526.20]  For once
[1526.20 --> 1526.58]  again
[1526.58 --> 1529.64]  who really
[1529.64 --> 1530.04]  is our
[1530.04 --> 1530.78]  true family?
[1532.78 --> 1533.60]  Is it
[1533.60 --> 1534.30]  not those
[1534.30 --> 1535.06]  men,
[1535.46 --> 1535.74]  women,
[1535.98 --> 1536.54]  and children
[1536.54 --> 1537.80]  who like
[1537.80 --> 1538.48]  John and
[1538.48 --> 1538.88]  Mary
[1538.88 --> 1540.22]  are willing
[1540.22 --> 1541.20]  to stand
[1541.20 --> 1542.26]  at the
[1542.26 --> 1542.78]  foot of the
[1542.78 --> 1543.30]  cross
[1543.30 --> 1545.62]  looking up
[1545.62 --> 1546.24]  to Jesus?
[1547.58 --> 1548.20]  You see
[1548.20 --> 1549.04]  it is here
[1549.04 --> 1550.04]  from the
[1550.04 --> 1550.66]  cross
[1550.66 --> 1552.08]  that Jesus
[1552.08 --> 1553.78]  is establishing
[1553.78 --> 1555.16]  the basis
[1555.16 --> 1557.28]  for true
[1557.28 --> 1558.58]  community.
[1558.58 --> 1561.18]  unity, a
[1561.18 --> 1561.70]  unity
[1561.70 --> 1563.46]  that runs
[1563.46 --> 1564.36]  deeper than
[1564.36 --> 1565.20]  knowing we
[1565.20 --> 1566.26]  came from
[1566.26 --> 1566.90]  the same
[1566.90 --> 1567.24]  womb
[1567.24 --> 1569.04]  because we
[1569.04 --> 1569.74]  are those
[1569.74 --> 1570.86]  born of
[1570.86 --> 1571.42]  God,
[1572.22 --> 1573.06]  says John,
[1573.52 --> 1574.60]  born from
[1574.60 --> 1575.14]  above
[1575.14 --> 1576.24]  by the
[1576.24 --> 1576.62]  Spirit.
[1576.62 --> 1581.26]  unity.
[1581.26 --> 1582.18]  Unity is
[1582.18 --> 1583.06]  so important
[1583.06 --> 1584.70]  in the
[1584.70 --> 1585.28]  family of
[1585.28 --> 1585.68]  God,
[1586.36 --> 1588.24]  but I
[1588.24 --> 1588.72]  might add
[1588.72 --> 1589.26]  never at
[1589.26 --> 1589.72]  the price
[1589.72 --> 1590.00]  of the
[1590.00 --> 1590.44]  gospel.
[1592.06 --> 1592.56]  Remember
[1592.56 --> 1593.46]  Jesus said
[1593.46 --> 1593.86]  at one
[1593.86 --> 1594.18]  point,
[1594.28 --> 1594.66]  I didn't
[1594.66 --> 1595.20]  come to
[1595.20 --> 1596.14]  bring peace,
[1596.88 --> 1597.42]  but division.
[1598.84 --> 1599.24]  And then
[1599.24 --> 1599.82]  to make it
[1599.82 --> 1600.34]  clear, he
[1600.34 --> 1600.86]  said even
[1600.86 --> 1601.58]  division in
[1601.58 --> 1602.24]  families,
[1603.28 --> 1604.20]  father against
[1604.20 --> 1604.82]  son and
[1604.82 --> 1605.74]  daughter against
[1605.74 --> 1606.12]  mother.
[1607.86 --> 1608.28]  You may
[1608.28 --> 1608.90]  remember the
[1608.90 --> 1609.44]  time on
[1609.44 --> 1609.90]  the way to
[1609.90 --> 1610.52]  the cross.
[1611.58 --> 1612.06]  There was a
[1612.06 --> 1612.52]  fellow who
[1612.52 --> 1612.74]  said,
[1612.84 --> 1613.40]  Jesus, I'd
[1613.40 --> 1613.72]  like to
[1613.72 --> 1614.20]  follow you,
[1614.28 --> 1614.70]  but first
[1614.70 --> 1615.34]  let me say
[1615.34 --> 1616.26]  goodbye to
[1616.26 --> 1617.22]  my family.
[1618.38 --> 1618.82]  And what
[1618.82 --> 1619.28]  did Jesus
[1619.28 --> 1619.74]  say?
[1620.74 --> 1621.40]  He said,
[1621.92 --> 1622.60]  no one who
[1622.60 --> 1623.04]  puts a
[1623.04 --> 1623.46]  hand to
[1623.46 --> 1624.04]  the plow
[1624.04 --> 1624.54]  and looks
[1624.54 --> 1625.76]  back is
[1625.76 --> 1626.58]  fit for
[1626.58 --> 1628.04]  service in
[1628.04 --> 1628.72]  the kingdom
[1628.72 --> 1630.04]  of God.
[1633.38 --> 1634.08]  You know,
[1634.12 --> 1634.58]  it has been
[1634.58 --> 1635.58]  sad for me,
[1635.58 --> 1636.30]  during this
[1636.30 --> 1636.80]  pandemic,
[1637.32 --> 1638.36]  to see how
[1638.36 --> 1639.12]  families,
[1639.36 --> 1640.82]  including God's
[1640.82 --> 1641.34]  family,
[1642.14 --> 1642.82]  has been
[1642.82 --> 1643.52]  divided,
[1645.04 --> 1645.80]  some not
[1645.80 --> 1646.58]  wanting to
[1646.58 --> 1647.28]  associate
[1647.28 --> 1648.98]  with other
[1648.98 --> 1650.76]  family members.
[1653.28 --> 1654.42]  Oh, we are
[1654.42 --> 1655.14]  to take one
[1655.14 --> 1655.94]  another's health
[1655.94 --> 1656.76]  seriously.
[1658.92 --> 1659.82]  But it
[1659.82 --> 1661.40]  seems to me
[1661.40 --> 1662.38]  that somehow,
[1662.38 --> 1662.94]  and I
[1662.94 --> 1663.62]  don't want
[1663.62 --> 1664.56]  to create
[1664.56 --> 1665.34]  something in
[1665.34 --> 1666.06]  as a guest
[1666.06 --> 1666.74]  pastor,
[1667.12 --> 1668.50]  but this
[1668.50 --> 1670.14]  seems so
[1670.14 --> 1670.66]  universal.
[1670.86 --> 1671.44]  It seems
[1671.44 --> 1672.38]  that somehow,
[1672.38 --> 1675.38]  over time,
[1675.38 --> 1677.74]  how we have
[1677.74 --> 1679.42]  responded to
[1679.42 --> 1681.46]  COVID has
[1681.46 --> 1682.40]  become more
[1682.40 --> 1684.64]  important than
[1684.64 --> 1685.34]  how we
[1685.34 --> 1687.28]  respond to
[1687.28 --> 1688.00]  Christ.
[1690.00 --> 1691.54]  How does
[1691.54 --> 1693.10]  that happen?
[1695.10 --> 1696.92]  I think
[1696.92 --> 1698.68]  some fear
[1698.68 --> 1699.94]  more what
[1699.94 --> 1701.74]  COVID will do
[1701.74 --> 1704.06]  than what
[1704.06 --> 1706.30]  sin will do.
[1706.30 --> 1710.56]  and when we
[1710.56 --> 1711.78]  no longer see
[1711.78 --> 1713.12]  the deadliness
[1713.12 --> 1714.36]  of our
[1714.36 --> 1716.06]  own sin,
[1716.36 --> 1716.98]  we will
[1716.98 --> 1717.86]  fail to
[1717.86 --> 1718.74]  appreciate
[1718.74 --> 1720.28]  the cure
[1720.28 --> 1721.76]  or vaccine
[1721.76 --> 1722.98]  of the
[1722.98 --> 1723.62]  cross.
[1723.62 --> 1727.98]  I don't
[1727.98 --> 1728.26]  want to
[1728.26 --> 1729.12]  oversimplify
[1729.12 --> 1729.76]  something.
[1730.96 --> 1731.40]  It's been
[1731.40 --> 1731.98]  challenging.
[1732.20 --> 1732.80]  Our family
[1732.80 --> 1733.26]  has been,
[1734.20 --> 1735.16]  we have
[1735.16 --> 1737.00]  five children.
[1738.42 --> 1738.86]  Two of the
[1738.86 --> 1739.66]  families are,
[1740.34 --> 1740.88]  they're not
[1740.88 --> 1741.74]  anti-vaxxers,
[1741.84 --> 1742.10]  but they're
[1742.10 --> 1743.12]  not vaxxed.
[1743.82 --> 1744.56]  One's lost
[1744.56 --> 1746.32]  a fairly
[1746.32 --> 1747.64]  good government
[1747.64 --> 1748.38]  job over
[1748.38 --> 1748.78]  this.
[1750.18 --> 1750.50]  We've
[1750.50 --> 1750.68]  stood
[1750.68 --> 1751.20]  together.
[1752.58 --> 1752.94]  We haven't
[1752.94 --> 1753.40]  divided.
[1753.62 --> 1753.74]  it.
[1754.94 --> 1756.06]  And others,
[1756.72 --> 1757.70]  they've been
[1757.70 --> 1758.98]  vaccinated and
[1758.98 --> 1760.00]  seen the
[1760.00 --> 1760.62]  value of
[1760.62 --> 1760.80]  it.
[1762.24 --> 1763.08]  So I don't
[1763.08 --> 1763.28]  want to
[1763.28 --> 1764.24]  oversimplify.
[1764.40 --> 1764.76]  It's not
[1764.76 --> 1765.40]  always been
[1765.40 --> 1767.62]  easy, the
[1767.62 --> 1768.32]  challenge of
[1768.32 --> 1768.82]  knowing how
[1768.82 --> 1769.38]  to deal
[1769.38 --> 1769.84]  with it.
[1771.14 --> 1772.24]  I've just
[1772.24 --> 1773.18]  come to
[1773.18 --> 1774.00]  think that
[1774.00 --> 1774.64]  we have
[1774.64 --> 1776.98]  overestimated
[1776.98 --> 1777.94]  what COVID
[1777.94 --> 1778.76]  can do
[1778.76 --> 1779.14]  and
[1779.14 --> 1780.68]  underestimated
[1780.68 --> 1781.38]  what the
[1781.38 --> 1782.42]  sin virus
[1782.42 --> 1783.60]  can do.
[1783.60 --> 1785.48]  and the
[1785.48 --> 1786.28]  sin virus
[1786.28 --> 1786.94]  has gotten
[1786.94 --> 1787.54]  to us
[1787.54 --> 1787.92]  and the
[1787.92 --> 1788.38]  devil's
[1788.38 --> 1788.78]  uses
[1788.78 --> 1790.24]  and we've
[1790.24 --> 1790.68]  forgotten
[1790.68 --> 1791.50]  who Jesus
[1791.50 --> 1792.04]  is,
[1793.04 --> 1793.40]  the one
[1793.40 --> 1794.10]  who cares
[1794.10 --> 1795.38]  and loves
[1795.38 --> 1796.06]  us from
[1796.06 --> 1796.88]  the cross,
[1797.88 --> 1800.42]  the one
[1800.42 --> 1801.14]  who saves
[1801.14 --> 1801.66]  us and
[1801.66 --> 1802.50]  calls us
[1802.50 --> 1803.38]  together
[1803.38 --> 1803.98]  to be
[1803.98 --> 1804.68]  his children.
[1804.68 --> 1808.06]  every crisis,
[1808.06 --> 1808.08]  every crisis,
[1809.08 --> 1810.00]  even the
[1810.00 --> 1810.38]  world
[1810.38 --> 1811.26]  crises,
[1812.96 --> 1813.46]  is a
[1813.46 --> 1814.86]  call to
[1814.86 --> 1815.58]  gather at
[1815.58 --> 1816.08]  the foot
[1816.08 --> 1817.10]  of the
[1817.10 --> 1817.72]  cross,
[1818.56 --> 1819.46]  where we're
[1819.46 --> 1820.40]  reminded of
[1820.40 --> 1821.50]  what our
[1821.50 --> 1822.46]  true
[1822.46 --> 1823.78]  allegiance
[1823.78 --> 1825.12]  in life
[1825.12 --> 1826.14]  and in
[1826.14 --> 1826.64]  death
[1826.64 --> 1827.50]  is.
[1827.50 --> 1828.68]  here at
[1828.68 --> 1829.58]  the cross,
[1829.58 --> 1830.96]  we become
[1830.96 --> 1832.28]  the true
[1832.28 --> 1833.68]  family
[1833.68 --> 1835.02]  of God.
[1835.98 --> 1836.78]  Brothers,
[1837.64 --> 1838.24]  sisters,
[1839.42 --> 1839.94]  in our
[1839.94 --> 1841.24]  Lord Jesus
[1841.24 --> 1842.06]  Christ,
[1843.06 --> 1843.82]  who will
[1843.82 --> 1845.78]  always care
[1845.78 --> 1846.24]  for,
[1846.80 --> 1847.64]  listen to,
[1847.92 --> 1848.76]  and be true
[1848.76 --> 1849.74]  to one another
[1849.74 --> 1850.94]  in love,
[1850.94 --> 1852.52]  because we
[1852.52 --> 1854.58]  know how
[1854.58 --> 1855.90]  much we
[1855.90 --> 1856.52]  have been
[1856.52 --> 1858.02]  loved and
[1858.02 --> 1859.02]  cared for
[1859.02 --> 1860.06]  by our
[1860.06 --> 1860.44]  Savior.
[1861.96 --> 1862.66]  We know
[1862.66 --> 1863.94]  that there's
[1863.94 --> 1865.36]  nothing that
[1865.36 --> 1866.12]  can separate
[1866.12 --> 1867.34]  us from
[1867.34 --> 1868.16]  his love
[1868.16 --> 1870.28]  and therefore
[1870.28 --> 1871.50]  nothing that
[1871.50 --> 1872.38]  can separate
[1872.38 --> 1873.84]  us in the
[1873.84 --> 1874.48]  family of
[1874.48 --> 1876.00]  God from
[1876.00 --> 1877.40]  loving one
[1877.40 --> 1877.82]  another.
[1878.96 --> 1879.52]  Pray with
[1879.52 --> 1879.76]  me.
[1880.94 --> 1883.36]  Lord Jesus,
[1883.58 --> 1884.04]  you have
[1884.04 --> 1884.98]  come into
[1884.98 --> 1885.72]  this world
[1885.72 --> 1886.54]  many years
[1886.54 --> 1887.18]  ago to
[1887.18 --> 1888.52]  identify with
[1888.52 --> 1888.98]  all the
[1888.98 --> 1890.18]  brokenness
[1890.18 --> 1891.40]  on so
[1891.40 --> 1892.24]  many levels
[1892.24 --> 1893.04]  that we
[1893.04 --> 1894.02]  experience,
[1894.40 --> 1895.36]  in order to
[1895.36 --> 1897.20]  call us
[1897.20 --> 1897.96]  to yourself,
[1898.62 --> 1899.28]  to see
[1899.28 --> 1900.20]  your incredible
[1900.20 --> 1901.40]  love and
[1901.40 --> 1902.52]  grace for
[1902.52 --> 1903.74]  us sinners,
[1904.92 --> 1905.62]  and to
[1905.62 --> 1906.64]  invite us
[1906.64 --> 1908.06]  to be part
[1908.06 --> 1908.92]  of your
[1908.92 --> 1910.12]  eternal
[1910.12 --> 1911.28]  family.
[1912.48 --> 1913.42]  Lord Jesus,
[1913.58 --> 1914.50]  help us to
[1914.50 --> 1915.26]  see the
[1915.26 --> 1917.02]  seriousness of
[1917.02 --> 1917.76]  our own
[1917.76 --> 1918.76]  sin so
[1918.76 --> 1919.20]  that we
[1919.20 --> 1920.16]  might very
[1920.16 --> 1921.38]  humbly
[1921.38 --> 1923.76]  and daily
[1923.76 --> 1925.60]  take up
[1925.60 --> 1926.58]  our cross
[1926.58 --> 1928.48]  and along
[1928.48 --> 1929.10]  with all
[1929.10 --> 1929.74]  those who
[1929.74 --> 1930.44]  call you
[1930.44 --> 1931.10]  Lord and
[1931.10 --> 1931.48]  Savior,
[1932.48 --> 1933.54]  follow you
[1933.54 --> 1935.22]  arm in
[1935.22 --> 1935.58]  arm,
[1936.58 --> 1937.08]  together
[1937.08 --> 1938.52]  serving
[1938.52 --> 1938.96]  you.
[1940.22 --> 1941.04]  Help us
[1941.04 --> 1942.62]  to so
[1942.62 --> 1944.08]  not only
[1944.08 --> 1944.72]  believe,
[1944.84 --> 1945.18]  but to
[1945.18 --> 1945.84]  walk with
[1945.84 --> 1946.06]  you,
[1946.22 --> 1946.80]  Lord Jesus,
[1947.26 --> 1947.80]  and to
[1947.80 --> 1948.78]  find us
[1948.78 --> 1949.54]  faithful
[1949.54 --> 1951.10]  to you
[1951.10 --> 1952.02]  and each
[1952.02 --> 1952.36]  other.
[1953.76 --> 1954.80]  We pray
[1954.80 --> 1955.60]  this in
[1955.60 --> 1955.96]  Jesus'
[1956.22 --> 1956.52]  name.
[1957.02 --> 1957.42]  Amen.
[1957.42 --> 1957.56]  Amen.
[1957.56 --> 1957.60]  Amen.

[1957.70 --> 1957.72]  Amen.
[1957.72 --> 1957.74]  Amen.
[1957.74 --> 1959.70]  Amen.
[1959.70 --> 1959.74]  Amen.
[1959.74 --> 1961.70]  Amen.
[1961.70 --> 1961.74]  Amen.
[1961.74 --> 1962.26]  Amen.

[1968.20 --> 1968.38]  Amen.
[1968.38 --> 1968.98]  We're going to sing
[1968.98 --> 1972.56]  and I'll let them call us to that.
[1993.50 --> 1993.64]  Amen.
[1995.10 --> 1996.00]  Amen.
[1996.00 --> 1996.68]  Amen.
[1996.68 --> 2013.50]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus, fast unmeasured, boundless free,
[2013.50 --> 2028.50]  rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me.
[2028.50 --> 2044.44]  Underneath me, all around me, is the current of thy love.
[2044.44 --> 2059.64]  Leading onward, leading onward, to thy glorious rest above.
[2059.64 --> 2078.36]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread his praise from shore to shore.
[2078.36 --> 2094.32]  How he loves us, ever loves us, changes never, nevermore.
[2094.32 --> 2110.34]  How he watches for his loved ones, dying to call them all his own.
[2110.34 --> 2126.42]  How for them he's interceding, watching o'er them from the throne.
[2126.42 --> 2144.50]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus, love of every love the best.
[2144.50 --> 2160.50]  Tis an ocean first of blessing, tis a haven sweet of rest.
[2160.50 --> 2177.50]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus, tis a haven of heavens to me.
[2177.50 --> 2194.04]  And it lifts me up to glory, for it lifts me up to thee.
[2207.50 --> 2214.04]  And it is a point in the service where we have the opportunity to bring our financial gifts to God.
[2214.58 --> 2220.64]  And any funds offered today will go towards the Chaplain and Refugee Support Mobilizer.
[2221.28 --> 2224.82]  And that is a ministry out of the Vancouver Christian Reformed Church
[2224.82 --> 2229.70]  that provides chaplaincy and other support services to refugee families
[2229.70 --> 2233.54]  as they try to adjust to life locally here in Canada.
[2233.54 --> 2239.14]  And while the deacons are coming up, there's a preview also they asked me to talk about
[2239.14 --> 2242.94]  is that on 27th of March, we will be having a special offering
[2242.94 --> 2245.06]  for something in the forefront of many of our minds
[2245.06 --> 2249.86]  is that the humanitarian crisis that's unfolding in Ukraine
[2249.86 --> 2251.26]  with all the victims of war there.
[2251.40 --> 2255.06]  So watch for some more information on that in the days and weeks to come.
[2263.54 --> 2277.56]  Come into my heart, blessed Jesus.
[2277.56 --> 2284.16]  Come into my heart, I pray.
[2284.16 --> 2314.14]  Come into my heart, Lord.
[2314.16 --> 2316.48]  Lord Jesus.
[2316.48 --> 2318.32]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2318.32 --> 2321.16]  Come in today.
[2321.16 --> 2325.56]  Come in to stay.
[2325.56 --> 2334.16]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2334.16 --> 2339.16]  Come in today.
[2339.16 --> 2341.16]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2341.16 --> 2347.16]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2347.16 --> 2353.16]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2353.16 --> 2357.16]  Come in today.
[2357.16 --> 2361.16]  Come in to stay.
[2361.16 --> 2384.16]  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.
[2384.16 --> 2391.16]  Please join me in prayer.
[2391.16 --> 2392.16]  Lord Jesus.
[2392.16 --> 2393.16]  Lord Jesus.
[2393.16 --> 2394.16]  Lord Jesus.
[2394.16 --> 2395.16]  Lord Jesus.
[2395.16 --> 2397.16]  God of our salvation, we praise you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer for our sins
[2397.16 --> 2400.64]  so we may be redeemed.
[2400.64 --> 2405.48]  We are thankful for the reminders of that redemption visible in creation with the beginnings of spring
[2405.48 --> 2407.48]  all around us.
[2407.48 --> 2408.48]  We are thankful for the reminders of our sins.
[2408.48 --> 2416.48]  We are thankful for the reminders of that redemption visible in our own lives as we experience your saving grace each and every day.
[2416.48 --> 2433.48]  We also ask that, as the source of the world's hope and redemption, you hear our prayers on behalf of all creation as we try to understand what it means to be stewards of your creation and how that colors our actions every day.
