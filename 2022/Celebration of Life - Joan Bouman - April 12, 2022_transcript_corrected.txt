[11.00 → 13.00] Amen.
[41.00 → 43.00] Amen.
[71.00 → 73.00] Amen.
[101.00 → 103.00] Amen.
[131.00 → 133.00] Amen.
[161.00 → 163.00] Amen.
[191.00 → 193.00] Amen.
[221.00 → 223.00] Amen.
[251.00 → 253.00] Amen.
[281.00 → 283.00] Amen.
[311.00 → 313.00] Amen.

[433.00 → 435.00] Amen.
[435.00 → 437.00] Good afternoon.
[437.00 → 448.00] We are here to celebrate the life of Joan Barman and to look to Jesus Christ as our hope
[448.00 → 450.00] in the face of death.
[450.00 → 457.00] So hear these words from scripture that proclaim the good news of the resurrection.
[457.00 → 459.00] Jesus said,
[459.00 → 461.00] the resurrection and the life.
[461.00 → 467.00] The one who believes in me will live even though they die.
[467.00 → 471.00] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[471.00 → 473.00] Do you believe this?
[473.00 → 474.00] The one who believes in me will never die.
[474.00 → 478.00] And Job foretold the resurrection in the Old Testament.
[478.00 → 479.00] He said,
[479.00 → 480.00] He said,
[480.00 → 485.00] I know that my redeemer lives and that he shall stand in the last days upon the earth.
[485.00 → 495.00] And though this body be destroyed, I shall see God, who I shall see for myself, how my heart yearns within me.
[495.00 → 497.00] The apostle Paul writes,
[497.00 → 499.00] I have fought the good fight.
[499.00 → 501.00] I have finished the race.
[501.00 → 504.00] I have kept the faith.
[504.00 → 513.00] Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day.
[513.00 → 518.00] And not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
[518.00 → 523.00] The apostle John writes in the book of Revelation,
[523.00 → 527.00] Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on.
[527.00 → 532.00] Even so says the spirit for they rest from their labours.
[532.00 → 534.00] Let us pray.
[534.00 → 539.00] Our loving God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit,
[539.00 → 549.00] we praise you that even in our grief, even in our sorrow, that you give us a sure and certain hope.
[549.00 → 558.00] Father, we praise you that you are the maker of the heavens and the earth, that you formed each one of us out of the dust.
[558.00 → 562.00] And you say that to dust, we return to you.
[562.00 → 564.00] Father, we praise you.
[564.00 → 568.00] Lord Jesus Christ, you are the resurrection in the life.
[568.00 → 572.00] You tasted death for every one of us.
[572.00 → 580.00] And you rose from the grave, putting death to death, and opening the way of eternal life for us.
[580.00 → 583.00] Our Lord Jesus, we praise you.
[583.00 → 589.00] And Holy Spirit, you are the counsellor and the comforter of everyone who grieves in sorrow.
[589.00 → 592.00] So Holy Spirit, we praise you.
[592.00 → 595.00] We praise you, our loving God, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[595.00 → 600.00] To you be all glory and honour forever and ever.
[600.00 → 601.00] Amen.
[601.00 → 609.00] Friends, we're going to open our service today singing praise to the God who we just addressed in prayer.
[609.00 → 613.00] So let's stand, and we'll sing together as the deer.
[613.00 → 614.00] Please stand.
[614.00 → 615.00] Please stand.
[615.00 → 625.00] ана
[625.00 → 631.00] San Finn
[631.00 → 632.00] Amen.
[661.00 → 662.00] Amen.
[691.00 → 692.00] Amen.
[721.00 → 723.00] Amen.
[751.00 → 752.00] Amen.
[752.00 → 753.00] Amen.
[753.00 → 754.00] Amen.
[754.00 → 773.76] You may be seated.
[773.76 → 774.72] Amen.
[774.72 → 776.16] Amen.
[776.16 → 777.16] Amen.
[777.16 → 778.16] Amen.
[778.16 → 779.16] Amen.
[779.16 → 780.16] Amen.
[780.16 → 786.62] So in this time, we will grieve in sadness.
[786.62 → 792.32] We will lift our hearts in hope because of the resurrection that's promised to us.
[792.32 → 796.16] And it's also a time to celebrate the life of Joan and to remember all that she meant
[796.16 → 797.16] to us.
[797.16 → 799.28] And so we're going to have some family come up.
[799.28 → 803.16] We'll have Al and Courtney, and they will share some family memories with us.
[803.16 → 804.16] Okay.
[804.16 → 828.06] So I recently found a journal excerpt of mine written from when I was in grade nine.
[828.06 → 833.64] It says, most teenagers hate visiting their grandparents, but going to grandma Joan and
[833.64 → 836.90] grandpa Jerry's is the highlight of my summer.
[836.90 → 840.10] We go lots of places and also do crafts.
[840.10 → 844.92] We go to Granville Island, Rifle Island, swimming, make crafts.
[844.92 → 849.04] And our biggest trip is when we go to Victoria for the day.
[849.04 → 851.06] Sometimes we just hang out and play games.
[851.06 → 858.18] They are the most caring, kind, happy, friendly, and helpful grandparents in the world.
[858.18 → 861.02] They also listen to us and our ideas.
[861.02 → 867.44] And they also have yummy food, Dutch cheese, Nutella, and aka slough.
[867.44 → 873.14] I think this simply sums up how I think of Grammy when I sat down to write this speech.
[873.14 → 876.06] The memories, the kindness, and the listening ear.
[876.06 → 881.44] There are a few important lessons that I have learned from Grammy.
[881.44 → 885.58] The first one was how to be present and make good memories.
[885.58 → 891.20] She always had a way of making our days feel fun and special.
[891.20 → 895.46] I think of taking the Sky Train or the sea bus somewhere for a picnic.
[895.46 → 900.30] I think of building rock dams along the water banks at Lynn Canyon.
[900.30 → 904.56] I think of hunting for blackberries on our bikes in Ladder.
[904.56 → 911.18] I think of trips to Victoria with a visit to the Dutch café and then off to the miniature museum.
[911.18 → 915.82] I think of playing a Nokia, Fiddler, and all sorts of games at Beachwood.
[915.82 → 918.76] And of course, the happy hour snacks.
[918.76 → 924.18] I think of looking for sand dollars during the low tides at Centennial Beach.
[924.18 → 928.42] I think of the endless crafts she brought over to create with us.
[928.42 → 933.64] I think of baking her famous apple muffins together.
[933.64 → 934.64] Grammy...
[934.64 → 946.30] I looked at Danielle and...
[946.30 → 950.08] Grammy was always looking for ways to connect with us.
[950.08 → 954.86] She was the first one to be on the floor playing or out the door for an adventure.
[954.86 → 959.08] I'm grateful to have so many happy ways to remember her.
[959.08 → 964.74] As I got older and went to university, Grammy and I exchanged many emails.
[964.74 → 967.08] I will miss those.
[967.08 → 972.08] Sorry.
[972.08 → 973.08] Okay.
[973.08 → 994.02] She always wanted to hear all the details about what I was up to and emailed back quickly
[994.02 → 996.18] with so much enthusiasm.
[996.18 → 1002.60] As I got older, the emails had more unnecessary periods and spaces, but the enthusiasm remained
[1002.60 → 1003.86] the same.
[1003.86 → 1011.48] I learned that simply being interested and curious about the lives of the people you love
[1011.48 → 1013.40] makes relationships stronger.
[1013.40 → 1018.16] And lastly, I learned a lot about being a loving couple.
[1018.16 → 1022.90] When I think of Grammy, it was actually quite difficult to separate her in my head from Grandpa
[1022.90 → 1024.56] Jerry.
[1024.56 → 1028.78] Whenever... wherever Grammy was, Grams was never far behind.
[1028.78 → 1034.86] I picture them both in the front seat driving us back from youth group or Grams waiting on
[1034.86 → 1038.12] a mall bench for us girls to finish shopping.
[1038.12 → 1042.04] They were a package deal and a beautiful partnership to witness.
[1042.04 → 1049.94] I think of this fondly as an example as I begin my own marriage very soon.
[1049.94 → 1055.38] One of my favourite funny memories was when Grammy would say something to us kids and then Grandpa
[1055.38 → 1061.12] would say the exact same thing word for word one minute later.
[1061.12 → 1066.74] Grammy turns back to us, rolls her eyes and says, it's like he's mocking me.
[1066.74 → 1071.90] Of course, Grandpa had no idea as he didn't hear with his hearing aids.
[1071.90 → 1079.12] But it shows how well they knew one another as they were often thinking the exact same thing.
[1079.12 → 1085.62] As cancer became a reality these past five years, it included lots of pain and suffering.
[1085.62 → 1088.86] But as we all know, Grammy was a little warrior.
[1088.86 → 1092.90] She stayed positive through it all, hopeful for the future.
[1092.90 → 1098.14] She took each day and made the most of it, still visiting, sending emails, and keeping
[1098.14 → 1100.30] up with her peeps.
[1100.30 → 1104.70] There were numerous times we thought she wouldn't be able to walk again, but she continued to
[1104.70 → 1109.20] surprise us in her resiliency amidst the disease.
[1109.20 → 1114.42] Even sneaking to the bathroom by herself when Grams wasn't looking.
[1114.42 → 1120.48] As the end came, it was so evident that Grammy took comfort in her saviour to care for her.
[1120.48 → 1125.64] As I think of facing my own pain, and even in this season of grieving, I am encouraged by
[1125.64 → 1130.32] Grammy's faith and hope in God that endured till the end.
[1130.32 → 1148.88] She was a brave, caring, and resilient Grammy, and I'm grateful for all she taught me.
[1148.88 → 1159.32] So awesome to see all my mom's friends and family here.
[1159.32 → 1175.84] Joan Bowman was many things as we all are, grandma, aunt, sister, friend.
[1175.84 → 1181.96] But to me, she was my mom.
[1181.96 → 1192.28] So I'm going to talk about her being my mom.
[1192.28 → 1194.54] We are here to remember her.
[1194.54 → 1200.30] And I am simply going to read out a list of things my sisters and I remember.
[1200.30 → 1205.94] The list will probably be similar to the things you remember about your mom.
[1205.94 → 1208.52] So by all means, think about Joan.
[1208.52 → 1217.52] But feel free to think about your own mom and the things she did for you.
[1217.52 → 1223.34] Cinnamon and sugar toast when we were sick.
[1223.34 → 1228.28] In my elementary school years, coming home for lunch and watching All My Children with
[1228.28 → 1231.28] her.
[1231.28 → 1235.74] Talking about All My Children at the dinner table.
[1235.74 → 1241.78] For those of you that don't know, All My Children was a soap opera.
[1241.78 → 1246.68] Calling our names from the kitchen window for dinner and doing it loud because she didn't
[1246.68 → 1250.02] know where we were.
[1250.02 → 1254.50] Hiking the West Coast Trail with her and my dad.
[1254.50 → 1259.96] Cross-country skiing with her and my dad.
[1259.96 → 1267.84] I remember her in the garden wearing her wooden shoes and pulling weeds.
[1267.84 → 1272.32] This one cleaning our backyard pond in her underwear.
[1272.32 → 1279.32] I never saw this, but Care says she saw it.
[1279.32 → 1284.72] Waking up on our birthdays to a birthday parade.
[1284.72 → 1287.96] Cutting my hair.
[1287.96 → 1291.38] Riding her Honda Passport scooter.
[1291.38 → 1298.00] Actually it was Care's, but since she wasn't riding it, well off goes Joan.
[1298.00 → 1301.42] I remember her shoes at O.K. Falls.
[1301.42 → 1304.48] I remember her lasagna.
[1304.48 → 1315.38] I remember her buying me a malt at the malt stop when she took me shopping.
[1315.38 → 1320.40] Sewing me parachute pants for break dancing.
[1320.40 → 1326.00] Sewing her grandkids' baby blankets, which they adored and named Lulu.
[1326.00 → 1328.42] I remember her clothes.
[1328.42 → 1332.00] We remember her creativity.
[1332.00 → 1337.10] Making cards and selling them at craft fairs with care.
[1337.10 → 1341.00] Candle making was a thing for a while.
[1341.00 → 1346.28] When Age and I returned from our honeymoon in Africa, we showed Mom a roll of African toilet
[1346.28 → 1348.00] paper.
[1348.00 → 1353.00] And instead of using it, she made Christmas ornaments out of it.
[1353.00 → 1359.58] I remember her selling her Christmas mice at the Country Mouse.
[1359.58 → 1363.18] The Country Mouse was a craft store, a consignment craft store in Stevenson.
[1363.18 → 1371.02] And she used to sew little mice in Christmas clothing to hang on your Christmas tree.
[1371.02 → 1374.84] So the teachers used to be so happy they got me as a student because it meant they got her
[1374.84 → 1381.38] special Christmas mice as a Christmas gift.
[1381.38 → 1384.46] She sewed our Halloween costumes.
[1384.46 → 1389.24] She made me a bear costume, which I wore all year round.
[1389.24 → 1397.62] And then she made Caleb a dinosaur costume, which he quickly outgrew.
[1397.62 → 1405.62] As I write this list, I'm realizing all the ways she influenced me and how easy it will be
[1405.62 → 1409.70] to remember her.
[1409.70 → 1414.34] Uncle Ted remarked last night that when he was making the picture boards, she seemed so proud
[1414.34 → 1417.84] and happy to have her kids around.
[1417.84 → 1425.02] And then it occurred to me that we like to be around her too.
[1425.02 → 1428.88] They say when you write a speech, it's always good to throw in a quote.
[1428.88 → 1434.22] The author Andy Nelson wrote, Grief and love are conjoined.
[1434.22 → 1437.96] You don't get one without the other.
[1437.96 → 1460.54] So I cried today because I loved you mom and I love you still.
[1460.54 → 1463.04] Let's rise and let's sing together when peace like a river.
[1467.96 → 1486.78] Let's sing together when peace like a river.
[1486.78 → 1492.96] Let's sing together when peace like a river.
[1492.96 → 1522.94] Let's sing together when peace like a river.
[1522.96 → 1552.94] Let's sing together when peace like a river.
[1552.94 → 1557.90] His children still fall in deed of his death
[1557.90 → 1561.92] For my God's grace residing
[1561.92 → 1566.38] I love Jesus named
[1566.38 → 1572.94] And that shins his own harm for us
[1572.94 → 1573.94] after
[1573.94 → 1582.92] His death is filled with my soul
[1582.92 → 1593.12] Every heart so low, it is well, it is well in my soul.
[1594.98 → 1603.90] I sing all that praise, the best glory is done.
[1603.90 → 1611.90] I sing all that praise, the best glory is done.
[1611.90 → 1620.80] His name to the cross, and I'm there in no more.
[1621.26 → 1628.62] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, all of us all.
[1628.62 → 1636.62] It is well, it is well, it is well in my soul.
[1636.62 → 1646.52] And my soul, it is well, it is well in my soul.
[1646.52 → 1656.52] Praise the Lord.
[1656.52 → 1658.52] Praise the Lord.
[1658.52 → 1659.52] Praise the Lord.
[1659.52 → 1660.52] Praise the Lord.
[1660.52 → 1662.52] Praise the Lord.
[1662.52 → 1664.52] Praise the Lord.
[1664.52 → 1668.52] Praise the Lord.
[1668.52 → 1670.52] Praise the Lord.
[1670.52 → 1672.52] Praise the Lord.
[1672.52 → 1674.52] Praise the Lord.
[1674.52 → 1676.52] Praise the Lord.
[1676.52 → 1678.52] Praise the Lord.
[1678.52 → 1679.52] Praise the Lord.
[1679.52 → 1682.52] And your soul, it is well in my soul.
[1682.52 → 1683.52] Amen.
[1683.52 → 1686.32] It is well in my soul.
[1686.32 → 1700.28] It is now, it is now, with my soul, with my soul.
[1700.28 → 1708.82] It is now, it is now, with my soul.
[1716.32 → 1720.06] You may be seated.
[1720.06 → 1723.78] So thank you so much Courtney and Al for sharing those memories of Joan.
[1723.78 → 1726.66] They are very special.
[1726.66 → 1731.54] And now we will invite Caleb and Alina to come up and read Psalm 23 from us.
[1731.54 → 1742.56] This morning at the burial site, Jerry shared how much Psalm 23 gave Joan so much comfort,
[1742.56 → 1745.14] especially just over the last several weeks.
[1745.14 → 1759.64] So let's turn our attention and listen to God's word.
[1759.64 → 1762.78] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[1762.78 → 1768.58] He machete me lie down in green pastures, he leader me beside still waters.
[1768.58 → 1773.90] He restored my soul, he leader me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[1773.90 → 1782.66] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[1782.66 → 1788.40] For thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[1788.40 → 1792.50] Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
[1792.50 → 1796.78] Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runner over.
[1798.22 → 1802.84] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
[1803.06 → 1805.92] and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1805.92 → 1827.08] Would you please pray with me?
[1827.08 → 1833.36] Father, we thank you that in Psalm 23, you tell us who you are.
[1833.36 → 1837.16] And you tell us who we are to you.
[1838.04 → 1840.68] And Father, most of all, you show us Jesus.
[1841.54 → 1845.46] So help us, Lord, to fix our eyes on him as we consider this psalm.
[1845.94 → 1847.56] And we ask in Jesus' name.
[1848.28 → 1848.66] Amen.
[1848.66 → 1848.74] Amen.
[1850.98 → 1853.32] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1854.46 → 1854.66] Right?
[1854.72 → 1862.64] There are a few phrases that are as familiar and more comforting to those who know and love the Bible.
[1863.94 → 1870.68] You know, Psalm 23 is often one of the very first passages that finds a place in the heart of a new believer.
[1870.68 → 1876.50] It's among the first passages that we teach our children.
[1877.66 → 1885.12] You know, I like to think of the Lord Jesus as a young boy, right, learning to recite Psalm 23.
[1885.26 → 1886.10] He prayed this prayer.
[1887.80 → 1895.48] And it's also among the last words that many of us hear as we depart this life and death.
[1895.48 → 1909.02] And because of this vivid picture of the Lord's care for us, it's also one of the best passages to give us comfort in times of trial and sorrow.
[1909.02 → 1918.30] Psalm 23 tells us that despite the sorrows and the dangers that we face in a fallen world,
[1918.86 → 1926.52] by trusting in Jesus, we will arrive safely to live forever in the house of the Lord.
[1928.32 → 1934.12] One of the most remarkable pictures of Psalm 23 is the description it gives us of God.
[1934.84 → 1935.30] It says,
[1935.30 → 1937.72] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1939.02 → 1942.74] You might know that the Lord is Yahweh.
[1943.08 → 1946.08] It's the personal covenant name of God.
[1947.04 → 1953.44] It comes from the great I am statement that God spoke to Moses at the burning bush where he says,
[1953.62 → 1955.28] I am that I am.
[1956.46 → 1961.64] And it just means that the Lord is the eternal, self-sufficient, almighty God.
[1961.64 → 1974.82] And yet David, the writer of the psalm, he looks to the Lord, and he speaks casually about his personal relationship with this God.
[1975.78 → 1983.12] He says this one true living God, the creator, redeemer of all things, he cares for me.
[1983.86 → 1985.64] He is my shepherd.
[1985.64 → 1986.64] He says this one true love.
[1986.64 → 1987.64] He says this one true love.
[1987.64 → 1988.64] He is my shepherd.
[1988.64 → 1993.42] He says, faith is a matter of personal pronouns.
[1993.42 → 1999.24] In other words, it's one thing to say, sure, the Lord is a shepherd.
[2000.24 → 2005.86] And it is another thing to be able to say, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2005.86 → 2013.84] One of the things I loved about visiting Joan over these last few months is that every time I would visit her,
[2013.98 → 2017.78] I would come prepared to read a passage of scripture.
[2018.04 → 2021.94] And so I'd say, you know, may we read a passage together?
[2022.12 → 2025.38] And she would say, yes, I would like that very much.
[2026.38 → 2030.94] And she said it with such a big, joyful smile on her face.
[2030.94 → 2034.50] And that smile, I think, said it all.
[2035.16 → 2036.56] Yes, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2037.48 → 2042.62] She just had this exuberance of love to reading God's word.
[2044.10 → 2048.04] And it's amazing that we can call the Lord my shepherd.
[2048.88 → 2055.38] Because in Israel, as in most ancient societies, a shepherd was looked down upon as a low class worker.
[2055.38 → 2062.24] You know, being a shepherd was dirty, exhausting, 24 hours a day work.
[2063.58 → 2072.56] And yet here we find that God himself takes up this place of a humble shepherd for us.
[2074.62 → 2081.08] So now Psalm 23 describes this journey that the sheep would take.
[2081.08 → 2084.72] It starts in the low hinterlands.
[2085.44 → 2091.02] It goes then through the dangerous valley and up to the high tablelands of the summer grazing.
[2092.02 → 2093.70] And in this way, there's a metaphor here.
[2094.56 → 2096.68] David here is discussing the believer's life.
[2097.48 → 2102.46] As we are led by the Lord in life and then through the valley of the shadow of death
[2102.46 → 2105.32] and then into the rich pastures of heaven above.
[2105.32 → 2112.68] So I want us to just consider these three stages of our journey that David talks about here in Psalm 23.
[2113.08 → 2117.02] And look at each way how God as our shepherd cares for us.
[2117.94 → 2120.70] So first in the first couple verses, the opening section,
[2121.62 → 2125.20] here David rejoices that because the Lord is his shepherd,
[2125.72 → 2128.54] it says that he won't lack anything.
[2128.66 → 2130.34] He has everything he needs.
[2130.34 → 2137.30] And David himself, who wrote this psalm, when he was a young boy, he also was a shepherd.
[2138.74 → 2141.28] He watched over his sheep.
[2141.82 → 2143.12] He provided for them.
[2143.44 → 2144.88] He tended his flock.
[2145.48 → 2147.80] He led them to the greenest pastures.
[2148.68 → 2154.22] He guided them to find gentle waters that they could drink from without falling in.
[2154.22 → 2162.92] He guided them on the right paths by day, and he protected them from dangerous wild animals by night.
[2164.60 → 2171.62] And David, as he writes this, he feels that he is under the same care as a tender, watchful shepherd.
[2173.26 → 2178.52] And even though David had been through many dangers and trials and sorrows himself,
[2179.02 → 2182.44] he knew that even all along the Lord was with him.
[2182.44 → 2185.56] So that's the opening scene that he talks about.
[2186.52 → 2191.84] But the second scene is perhaps what we most often think of in regard to Psalm 23.
[2192.38 → 2193.34] Verse 4 says,
[2193.96 → 2200.22] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[2200.86 → 2202.80] Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[2204.64 → 2209.82] So David knew that he would not lack anything in life with the shepherd's care over him,
[2209.82 → 2213.06] but he also knew that he would not fear in death.
[2213.96 → 2214.54] Why not?
[2215.24 → 2216.36] Because of his shepherd.
[2218.04 → 2225.22] Now in terms of the metaphor, this verse describes the sheep's journey from the lowland in the winter grazing
[2225.22 → 2227.66] to the high pastures of the summer feeding,
[2227.66 → 2230.98] and they had to go through valleys along the way.
[2231.04 → 2232.42] And these valleys were dangerous.
[2232.92 → 2236.50] Wild animals would lurk in the canyons and in the shadows.
[2237.66 → 2242.64] Floods would suddenly come up and unexpectedly sweep through the canyon.
[2244.22 → 2248.42] David sees this valley as the believer's passage through death.
[2248.42 → 2253.96] So let me point out a couple of things about the Christian's passage through this valley.
[2254.98 → 2259.66] The first is that David sees the Christian passing through the valley.
[2260.58 → 2263.72] Not into it, but through it.
[2264.88 → 2265.10] Right?
[2265.46 → 2271.72] It's a wonderful thing that the valley of the shadow of death is in the middle of Psalm 23.
[2272.32 → 2273.26] Not at the end.
[2274.54 → 2277.54] And what that tells us is that death is not the final destination.
[2277.54 → 2279.96] It is the passage that we make.
[2280.58 → 2284.68] And it leads the follower of Christ into these greener fields beyond.
[2286.28 → 2291.04] And so friends, Joan has not passed into death there to remain.
[2291.38 → 2299.24] She has passed briefly through death into this good land where her good shepherd has led her.
[2300.90 → 2306.86] We also notice that David speaks of this valley as possessing only the shadow.
[2307.54 → 2310.38] of death for the sheep who are led by Jesus.
[2312.20 → 2316.68] And that means on the one hand, we grieve the reality of death as it appears to us.
[2318.24 → 2320.80] Because of sin that has come into the world,
[2321.06 → 2324.82] God didn't create the world with death to be in it.
[2324.96 → 2327.64] But now there is death and death is our enemy.
[2328.78 → 2329.96] Death affects us deeply.
[2329.96 → 2336.66] and it is an offence against this good world that was made by our loving God.
[2337.88 → 2339.76] And so we grieve, and we feel grief.
[2341.14 → 2346.70] Every one of us, every family member and friend of Joan will have times when we deeply grieve.
[2348.14 → 2352.36] But friends, Jesus has removed the sting of death.
[2353.00 → 2356.48] So it will cannot actually harm us.
[2357.40 → 2359.52] Paul writes in 1 Corinthians,
[2359.96 → 2364.40] Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?
[2366.22 → 2369.80] Matthew Henry has a little comment on this verse, and he says this,
[2370.60 → 2373.22] It is but the shadow of death.
[2373.96 → 2378.42] The shadow of a serpent will not sting, nor the shadow of a sword slay.
[2379.86 → 2381.62] Do you hear that? It's a shadow.
[2382.36 → 2383.84] It can't actually harm us.
[2383.84 → 2387.94] The harm of death has been taken away by the resurrection of Jesus.
[2389.74 → 2393.90] And then thirdly, notice that no believer is ever alone in this passage through death.
[2394.02 → 2394.64] David says,
[2395.20 → 2396.58] My shepherd will be with me.
[2397.66 → 2401.22] He will provide comfort and protection from any harm.
[2402.76 → 2405.94] He is with us in the valley as we pass through it.
[2405.94 → 2410.34] And it is Jesus' presence with us that enables us to say,
[2410.54 → 2411.82] In the face of the shadow of death,
[2412.12 → 2414.94] I will fear no evil.
[2415.18 → 2415.70] Why not?
[2416.38 → 2417.74] Because you are with me.
[2420.18 → 2423.40] When Joan passed through this valley, like we all will one day,
[2423.98 → 2425.04] she was not alone.
[2425.90 → 2427.24] She was not at all alone.
[2428.32 → 2429.34] Jesus was with her.
[2429.34 → 2437.28] And then the final verses of the psalm show the sheep's journey coming to its final destination.
[2438.36 → 2439.24] In verse 5 it says,
[2439.36 → 2442.24] You prepare a table before me.
[2443.38 → 2443.84] Right?
[2443.90 → 2448.82] The tablelands were these highlands where the sheep would enjoy the cool summer pasture.
[2450.10 → 2453.22] And the shepherd would go on ahead of the sheep.
[2453.64 → 2456.32] It would prepare those fields well in advance.
[2456.54 → 2458.58] It would weed out any poisonous plants.
[2458.58 → 2463.06] It would, you know, vanquish and drive away any predators.
[2464.38 → 2468.64] It's an amazing picture of the finished work of Jesus Christ for us.
[2469.00 → 2471.16] He has prepared those lands for us.
[2471.34 → 2474.38] And it reminds us of what Jesus himself says in John 14.
[2475.40 → 2476.16] Jesus says,
[2476.56 → 2478.56] My father's house has many rooms.
[2479.32 → 2484.72] If that were not so, would I have told you that I am going to there to prepare a place for you.
[2484.72 → 2494.38] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
[2496.06 → 2496.50] Right?
[2496.70 → 2504.14] Friends, Joan has a place prepared for her by her good shepherd.
[2504.14 → 2510.82] And then David ends the psalm in verse 6 with these beautiful words of confidence.
[2511.46 → 2515.06] He tells us that everyone who follows Jesus will arrive safely home.
[2516.16 → 2516.68] It says,
[2516.68 → 2523.48] Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[2523.48 → 2527.80] Now, when we read that, the question we might ask is,
[2528.90 → 2537.34] Okay, so what is it about the sheep that enables them to take this journey and finally make it to that pasture?
[2537.80 → 2544.62] How can I be that kind of sheep who passes through those dark valleys and enters into the pastures above?
[2544.62 → 2545.62] How can I be that kind of sheep?
[2545.62 → 2546.62] How can I be that kind of sheep?
[2546.62 → 2548.94] Now, we might think, well, is it the strength of the sheep?
[2550.06 → 2554.12] Is it the wisdom of the sheep or the skill of the sheep?
[2554.28 → 2557.10] Is it just about being a good, kind sheep?
[2558.98 → 2559.46] No.
[2560.36 → 2566.84] The thing about sheep is that sheep are especially known for being an animal that has none of these qualities.
[2567.50 → 2571.86] It is the weakest, the most foolish, the most vulnerable of creatures.
[2571.86 → 2579.44] The sheep's entry into the house of the Lord forever is not because of the merit, the strength, or the character of the sheep.
[2579.58 → 2590.64] The only answer is that it is based on the merit and the strength and the character in what he has accomplished, our Lord Jesus, the shepherd, the great shepherd who saves his sheep.
[2592.00 → 2592.90] Jesus says,
[2592.90 → 2595.24] I lay down my life for the sheep.
[2596.10 → 2599.18] I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.
[2599.18 → 2601.94] No one will snatch them out of my hand.
[2603.94 → 2609.94] And so, friends, if you are able to say, like Joan was, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2610.14 → 2612.22] If you can say that, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2612.88 → 2616.68] Then you will also be able to say with joy and confidence,
[2617.24 → 2620.52] I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[2622.12 → 2622.98] Okay, let's pray.
[2622.98 → 2633.68] Our Father in heaven, our good shepherd, we thank you that Joan was a sheep of your flock,
[2634.68 → 2639.74] a lamb of your own choosing, who knew your voice,
[2640.74 → 2647.34] a sinner who has been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[2647.34 → 2651.32] And we thank you, Lord, that you are the good shepherd.
[2652.26 → 2657.04] And as we reflect on these things, help us to turn in faith to Jesus,
[2657.40 → 2659.64] so that each one of us here today can say,
[2660.06 → 2661.96] the Lord is my shepherd.
[2662.50 → 2663.54] I shall not want.
[2664.00 → 2664.98] I shall not fear.
[2665.70 → 2668.18] And I will surely dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[2668.98 → 2670.54] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2671.32 → 2671.64] Amen.
[2671.64 → 2679.04] Let's all stand and let's sing another song chosen by the family that is very meaningful.
[2679.50 → 2681.32] Precious Lord, take my hand.
[2681.56 → 2682.02] Let's stand.
[2682.02 → 2682.06] Let's stand.
[2682.06 → 2683.06] Amen.
[2712.06 → 2713.06] Amen.
[2742.06 → 2743.06] Amen.
[2772.06 → 2774.06] Amen.
[2802.06 → 2803.06] Amen.
[2803.06 → 2804.06] Amen.
[2804.06 → 2808.06] Precious Lord, be God.
[2808.06 → 2809.06] Amen.
[2809.06 → 2810.06] Amen.
[2810.06 → 2811.06] Amen.
[2811.06 → 2812.06] Amen.
[2812.06 → 2813.06] Amen.
[2813.06 → 2814.06] Amen.
[2814.06 → 2815.06] Amen.
[2815.06 → 2816.06] Amen.
[2816.06 → 2817.06] Amen.
[2817.06 → 2819.06] Amen.
[2819.06 → 2820.06] Amen.
[2820.06 → 2823.06] You may be seated.
[2823.06 → 2829.06] So let me lead us in a prayer.
[2829.06 → 2836.06] Before we prepare to go with God's blessing, let's pray together.
[2836.06 → 2850.06] Our Father, in this hour, this time of Christian victory for Joan, we join also our hearts with hers in praising your name.
[2850.06 → 2859.06] We lift our hearts in praise for the love that you showed in giving your son, our Lord Jesus, for Joan's salvation and for our own.
[2859.06 → 2867.06] And for the promises in your word that through faith in our Redeemer, we have the unshakeable assurance of eternal life.
[2867.06 → 2872.06] Because Jesus lives and has died and has risen again for us.
[2872.06 → 2877.06] We thank you that in Jesus Christ we have a living hope.
[2877.06 → 2881.06] A hope not in ourselves, not in our behaviour, not in our religion.
[2881.06 → 2886.06] But we have hope in Jesus Christ and what he has accomplished for us.
[2886.06 → 2889.06] We have hope in the promise to come again.
[2889.06 → 2892.06] That he will come again.
[2892.06 → 2894.06] And that he will destroy death forever.
[2894.06 → 2901.06] We thank you, Heavenly Father, that in your providence you called Joan to yourself.
[2901.06 → 2905.06] And now she receives this gift of eternal life.
[2905.06 → 2912.06] For those of us who are still here in this veil of tears, we ask that you would bring comfort.
[2912.06 → 2921.06] And with the thought that in Christ, Joan is in your presence and that she lives forever with no more pain or sorrow.
[2921.06 → 2937.06] We especially pray that you would bring comfort in these coming days to Jerry, to their children, to their grandchildren, to their great-grandchildren, to her siblings, all of her family.
[2937.06 → 2943.06] Father, would you continue your ministry of comfort in this family in their time of grief.
[2943.06 → 2950.06] Lord, give us a quiet and confident faith in the one who loved us and who gave his life for us.
[2950.06 → 2955.06] And help us in the coming days to lift our hearts to our shepherd, Jesus Christ.
[2955.06 → 2958.06] We pray in his holy name.
[2958.06 → 2959.06] Amen.
[2959.06 → 2965.06] Now would you stand and let's receive the blessing of the Lord, the benediction.
[2965.06 → 2970.06] And after that we will sing one final song, Because He Lives.
[2970.06 → 2972.06] Now receive the benediction.
[2972.06 → 2975.06] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[2975.06 → 2979.06] The Lord turn his face toward you and be gracious to you.
[2979.06 → 2983.06] And the Lord lift his face upon you and give you peace.
[2983.06 → 2986.06] Let's sing again, Because He Lives.
[2986.06 → 2987.06] Let's sing again, Because He Lives.
[2987.06 → 2989.06] Let's sing again, Because He Lives.
[2989.06 → 2991.06] Let's sing again, With all of Jesus.
[2991.06 → 2993.06] Amen.
[3021.06 → 3023.06] Amen.
[3051.06 → 3053.06] Amen.
[3081.06 → 3083.06] Amen.
[3111.06 → 3113.06] Amen.
[3141.06 → 3163.00] You may be seated.
[3163.00 → 3172.76] On behalf of the family, I want to thank you for coming and joining us for the celebration
[3172.76 → 3174.42] of life.
[3174.42 → 3178.18] And the family would like to invite you for a time of refreshments, right through the
[3178.18 → 3181.14] doors in the fellowship hall in the back.
[3181.14 → 3186.58] And right now we will have the ushers dismiss everyone row by row beginning in the front.
[3186.58 → 3189.44] So thank you again for coming.
[3193.00 → 3194.00] Amen.
[3223.00 → 3224.00] Amen.
[3253.00 → 3255.00] Amen.
