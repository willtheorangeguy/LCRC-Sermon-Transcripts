[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[270.00 → 299.98] Thank you.
[300.00 → 329.98] Thank you.
[330.00 → 359.98] Thank you.
[359.98 → 389.96] Thank you.
[389.96 → 391.14] In Jesus' name we pray.
[391.14 → 392.34] Amen.
[419.96 → 449.96] 
[449.96 → 479.94] Thank you.
[479.94 → 509.92] Why are you so far from saving me?
[509.92 → 539.90] Thank you.
[539.90 → 545.90] What wondrous love is this, O my soul.
[545.90 → 575.88] What wondrous love is this, that cost the Lord of bliss, that cost the Lord of bliss, to bear the dreadful curse for my soul.
[575.88 → 605.86] Thank you.
[605.86 → 618.78] When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down.
[618.78 → 626.78] When I was sinking down, sinking down.
[626.78 → 636.78] When I was sinking down beneath God's righteous frown,
[637.98 → 646.78] Christ laid aside his crown for my soul, for my soul.
[646.78 → 655.78] Christ laid aside his crown for my soul.
[656.78 → 661.78] Yet you brought me out of the womb.
[661.78 → 666.78] You made me trust in you, even at my mother's breast.
[666.78 → 669.78] From birth I was cast on you.
[669.78 → 673.78] From my mother's womb you have been my God.
[673.78 → 680.78] Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
[686.78 → 695.78] To God and to the Lamb I will sing. I will sing.
[695.78 → 713.78] To God and to the Lamb I will sing. To God and to the Lamb who is the great I am.
[713.78 → 732.78] While millions join the theme, I will sing. I will sing.
[732.78 → 741.78] I will declare your name to my people. In the assembly I will praise you.
[741.78 → 744.78] You who fear the Lord, praise him.
[744.78 → 748.78] All you descendants of Jacob, honour him.
[748.78 → 752.78] Revere him, all you descendants of Israel.
[752.78 → 760.78] For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one.
[760.78 → 766.78] He has not hidden his face from him, but has listened to his cry for help.
[766.78 → 772.78] From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly.
[772.78 → 776.78] Before those who fear you, I will fulfill my vows.
[776.78 → 779.78] The poor will eat and be satisfied.
[779.78 → 782.78] Those who seek the Lord will praise him.
[782.78 → 785.78] May your hearts live forever.
[785.78 → 793.78] All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord.
[793.78 → 799.78] And all the families of the nations will bow down before him.
[799.78 → 805.78] For dominion belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.
[805.78 → 810.78] All the rich of the earth will feast and worship.
[810.78 → 815.78] All who go down to the dust will kneel before him.
[815.78 → 819.78] Those who cannot keep themselves alive.
[819.78 → 832.78] And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on, I'll sing on.
[832.78 → 841.78] And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on.
[841.78 → 850.78] And when from death I'm free, I'll sing in joyful peace.
[850.78 → 857.78] And through eternity I'll sing on.
[857.78 → 860.78] I'll sing on.
[860.78 → 869.78] And through eternity I'll sing on.
[880.78 → 892.78] Thanks.
[892.78 → 896.78] Thank you.
[896.78 → 915.98] When I surveyed the wondrous cross
[915.98 → 925.20] On which the brims of glory died
[925.20 → 935.14] My riches gained I count but loss
[935.14 → 945.20] And bore contempt on all my pride
[945.20 → 954.66] Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
[954.66 → 964.60] Save in the death of Christ my God
[964.60 → 974.60] All the late things that are repost
[974.60 → 984.54] I sacrifice them through His blood
[984.54 → 994.54] Seed from His head, His hands, His feet
[994.54 → 1006.48] Sorrow and love flow may go down
[1006.48 → 1016.42] Till there such love and sorrow meet
[1016.42 → 1026.42] For thorns come, O soul, rich of God
[1026.42 → 1036.36] Were the whole realm of nature mine
[1036.36 → 1046.36] That were a present far too small
[1046.36 → 1056.30] Love so amazing, so divine
[1056.30 → 1066.30] Demands my soul, my life, my all
[1066.30 → 1076.24] Amen
[1076.24 → 1086.18] Amen
[1086.18 → 1088.18] Amen
[1088.18 → 1110.62] This is God with a man's beating heart
[1110.62 → 1114.40] Who bleeds from open wounds of a man's skin
[1114.40 → 1116.60] While nailed to a tree
[1116.60 → 1119.56] Considering his torturers below
[1119.56 → 1121.56] And forgives them
[1121.56 → 1129.50] This is God with a man's heart
[1129.50 → 1131.50] Who ensures his love for us
[1131.50 → 1133.50] Will never run dry
[1133.50 → 1151.44] Our eyes are turned to the Lord God our Saviour
[1151.44 → 1157.38] This is God with a man's compassion
[1157.38 → 1160.38] Who grants grace to another
[1160.38 → 1163.44] Who confesses his guilt and shame
[1163.44 → 1168.50] This is God with a son's love for his mother
[1168.50 → 1173.78] Who entrusts her future to the care of his beloved friend
[1173.78 → 1200.82] This is God with a man's debt to carry
[1200.82 → 1202.52] Who pays it all
[1202.52 → 1204.90] Finished and done
[1204.90 → 1210.22] This is God with a man's frailty and fear
[1210.22 → 1214.62] Feeling forsaken, conquering death and hatred
[1214.62 → 1216.96] By dying for us
[1216.96 → 1230.00] Arise, I turn to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1230.00 → 1238.00] Arise, I turn to the Lord God our Saviour
[1238.00 → 1244.86] This is God with a man's last breath
[1244.86 → 1248.88] Giving his spirit into the hands of his Father
[1248.88 → 1251.02] And in so doing
[1251.02 → 1253.26] Ensures we live forever
[1253.26 → 1253.86] Forever
[1253.86 → 1268.24] O crucified Jesus
[1268.24 → 1270.12] Ruler of every heart
[1270.12 → 1273.04] If you are the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[1273.04 → 1276.26] In you dwell all the fullness of the Godhead
[1276.26 → 1278.76] We worship you
[1278.76 → 1278.96] We worship you
[1278.96 → 1283.96] Jesus, Lamb of God
[1283.96 → 1285.96] Have mercy on us
[1285.96 → 1286.58] Have mercy on us
[1286.58 → 1291.86] Jesus, Bearer of our sins
[1291.86 → 1294.58] Have mercy on us
[1294.58 → 1299.74] Jesus, Redeemer of the world
[1299.74 → 1302.16] Grant us peace
[1302.16 → 1320.86] Almighty God
[1320.86 → 1323.22] Look with mercy on your family
[1323.22 → 1326.76] For whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed
[1326.76 → 1330.04] And to be given over to the hands of sinners
[1330.04 → 1332.60] And to suffer death on the cross
[1332.60 → 1336.28] Through him who now lives and reigns with you
[1336.28 → 1337.42] And the Holy Spirit
[1337.42 → 1338.78] One God
[1338.78 → 1340.08] Forever and ever
[1340.08 → 1340.76] Amen
[1340.76 → 1341.62] Amen
[1341.62 → 1366.12] Your only Son
[1366.12 → 1369.18] No sin to hide
[1369.18 → 1375.60] But you have sent him from your side
[1375.60 → 1382.18] To walk upon this guilty song
[1382.18 → 1388.76] And to become the Lamb of God
[1388.76 → 1395.02] Your gift of love
[1395.02 → 1397.04] They crucified
[1397.04 → 1404.54] They laughed and scorned him as he died
[1404.54 → 1411.12] The humble king they raped a fraud
[1411.12 → 1417.62] And sacrificed the Lamb of God
[1417.62 → 1420.96] O Lamb of God
[1420.96 → 1424.20] Sweet Lamb of God
[1424.20 → 1430.68] I love the Holy Lamb of God
[1430.68 → 1437.26] O wash me in his precious blood
[1437.26 → 1444.26] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[1444.26 → 1450.54] I was so lost
[1450.54 → 1453.68] I should have died
[1453.68 → 1460.20] But you have brought me to your side
[1460.20 → 1466.78] To be led by your staff and rod
[1466.78 → 1473.44] And to become the Lamb of God
[1473.44 → 1476.78] O Lamb of God
[1476.78 → 1478.78] O Lamb of God
[1478.78 → 1483.78] I love the Holy Lamb of God
[1483.78 → 1493.10] O wash me in his precious blood
[1493.10 → 1499.68] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[1499.68 → 1503.02] O Lamb of God
[1503.02 → 1505.02] O Lamb of God
[1505.02 → 1505.06] O Lamb of God
[1505.06 → 1507.30] O Lamb of God
[1507.30 → 1511.02] O Lamb of God
[1511.02 → 1512.02] O Lamb of God
[1512.02 → 1517.02] O wash me in his precious blood
[1517.02 → 1521.52] My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God
[1521.52 → 1526.02] O Lamb of God
[1526.02 → 1528.02] Amen.
[1556.02 → 1557.24] That he spoke from the cross.
[1558.40 → 1563.84] And we're looking this morning at Luke 23, verse 46.
[1564.54 → 1571.34] Where Luke gives us Jesus' very last words from the cross before he dies.
[1571.34 → 1572.26] Is this it?
[1572.78 → 1573.24] Hold on.
[1574.40 → 1575.46] Should I switch to my...
[1575.46 → 1581.64] How's that?
[1583.66 → 1584.40] Hello, hello?
[1584.80 → 1585.24] There we go.
[1586.02 → 1586.78] Now you can hear me.
[1587.56 → 1587.84] Okay.
[1588.50 → 1594.76] Well, what I was saying was that this morning we'll finish up the series we've been going
[1594.76 → 1596.36] through on the seven last words of Jesus.
[1596.36 → 1600.92] Looking today at Luke 23, verse 46.
[1601.88 → 1607.22] This is Jesus' very last statement from the cross before he dies.
[1607.22 → 1617.12] And I believe that in these words of Jesus, we have a word of complete confidence.
[1617.56 → 1618.84] Complete confidence.
[1620.50 → 1623.36] Jesus called out with a loud voice,
[1623.36 → 1624.70] Father, into your hands.
[1624.70 → 1629.24] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[1629.24 → 1634.08] When he had said this, he breathed his last.
[1634.08 → 1635.08] Let's pray.
[1635.08 → 1637.22] Let's pray.
[1637.22 → 1645.68] Our Father, we thank you for gathering us on this Good Friday.
[1645.68 → 1646.68] Lord, we pray.
[1646.68 → 1647.68] Amen.
[1647.68 → 1648.68] Amen.
[1648.68 → 1649.68] Amen.
[1649.68 → 1650.68] Amen.
[1650.68 → 1651.68] Amen.
[1651.68 → 1652.68] Amen.
[1652.68 → 1653.68] Amen.
[1653.68 → 1654.68] Amen.
[1654.68 → 1655.68] Amen.
[1656.00 → 1656.86] I love you.
[1656.86 → 1657.68] Amen.
[1657.68 → 1657.76] Amen.
[1657.76 → 1658.26] Amen.
[1658.26 → 1658.38] Amen.
[1658.38 → 1658.84] Amen.
[1658.84 → 1667.02] Lord, would you minister to each one of us this morning through your word and the confidence that Jesus declared.
[1667.46 → 1669.44] We pray in his holy name. Amen.
[1671.26 → 1678.70] So as I was reading these words this week, I was struck by the mystery of last words.
[1679.74 → 1682.64] I mean, last words are truly mysterious.
[1682.64 → 1689.32] And at times they can illuminate the heart of the individual who speaks them.
[1690.10 → 1692.46] So I was looking up some famous last words.
[1692.82 → 1693.90] Have you ever done that?
[1694.02 → 1700.30] Have you ever read some famous last words of famous individuals?
[1701.30 → 1707.26] Because there are a multitude of expressions of the heart as one faces death.
[1708.42 → 1712.48] Sometimes words can be, last words can be realistic.
[1713.54 → 1717.02] Frank Sinatra said to his wife, I'm losing.
[1719.36 → 1721.28] Sometimes last words can be angry.
[1722.26 → 1725.72] Karl Marx said to those near him, go on, get out.
[1726.28 → 1729.56] Last words are for fools who have not said enough.
[1731.50 → 1733.10] Sometimes they are humorous.
[1733.76 → 1738.42] Oscar Wilde said, either the wallpaper goes or I do.
[1740.00 → 1740.90] That's a good one.
[1740.90 → 1742.80] Witty right to the end.
[1744.76 → 1746.34] Sometimes last words are sweet.
[1747.80 → 1753.74] Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, turned to his wife and said,
[1754.12 → 1755.34] you are wonderful.
[1755.34 → 1761.56] Sometimes last words can be beautiful.
[1763.24 → 1766.52] Mother Teresa said, Jesus, I love you.
[1767.10 → 1768.12] Jesus, I love you.
[1768.12 → 1773.30] But in the last words of Jesus, we find something more.
[1774.30 → 1775.90] We find something profound.
[1777.06 → 1781.22] It's amazing to me that Jesus, as he's hanging on the cross in utter agony,
[1781.22 → 1787.30] is able to say with a calm confidence in a loud voice,
[1787.86 → 1792.90] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[1792.90 → 1797.68] So I want to ask this morning, on this Good Friday,
[1798.06 → 1800.66] what can we learn from Christ's last words?
[1801.26 → 1806.58] And how can we gain that same absolute confidence in the face of death?
[1806.58 → 1812.64] There are many things we can mention, but today I want to briefly consider a few things
[1812.64 → 1815.10] that are quite important for us as believers.
[1817.68 → 1822.28] First, Jesus had confidence in his finished work.
[1823.24 → 1829.52] He was confident that the work his father had given him was absolutely complete.
[1829.52 → 1830.50] It was done.
[1831.44 → 1835.66] It was Leonardo da Vinci, the artist, the scientist, the inventor,
[1835.98 → 1838.38] who said in his last words,
[1838.78 → 1841.32] I have offended God and mankind
[1841.32 → 1846.70] because my work did not reach the quality it should have.
[1848.06 → 1848.58] Really?
[1851.22 → 1855.08] It's not many of us who will go to the grave and be able to say,
[1855.26 → 1858.30] I have accomplished everything I have set my heart to do.
[1858.30 → 1862.00] Probably all of us, when we stand before a holy God,
[1862.24 → 1865.16] will find our work done in this life incomplete
[1865.16 → 1868.22] and incompatible with God's perfection.
[1869.66 → 1871.04] But not Jesus.
[1872.62 → 1878.30] Jesus had a calm confidence that he can go to the Father with a clear conscience
[1878.30 → 1883.32] and a satisfaction that his work was perfectly accomplished.
[1884.12 → 1887.70] Because as we explored last Sunday, what did Jesus say from the cross?
[1888.30 → 1890.12] He said, it is finished.
[1891.36 → 1897.02] In fact, what I find very fascinating is the first words that we have of Jesus
[1897.02 → 1898.50] that are recorded for us.
[1899.10 → 1901.14] He said to his parents, do you remember Jesus?
[1901.84 → 1903.40] And his family had gone to Jerusalem,
[1904.40 → 1906.90] and Jesus disappeared in the big city.
[1907.10 → 1907.94] They couldn't find him.
[1907.94 → 1910.92] And they found him in the temple.
[1911.32 → 1915.30] And I like, actually, how the New King James translates this verse.
[1915.38 → 1917.28] In Luke 2, verse 49,
[1917.90 → 1920.56] Jesus says to his parents, as a small boy,
[1921.68 → 1922.82] why did you seek me?
[1923.68 → 1927.94] Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?
[1927.94 → 1932.20] And Jesus, on the cross, had finished that business.
[1932.58 → 1933.68] He had completed the work.
[1934.54 → 1936.58] And here, as he hangs on the cross, he is able to say,
[1936.66 → 1940.64] Father, I now, I just commit myself into your hands
[1940.64 → 1944.26] because I have done all that you have sent me to do.
[1944.26 → 1950.42] So I want to ask myself and each one of us this morning,
[1951.08 → 1953.94] as you ponder the confidence of Jesus on the cross,
[1954.80 → 1958.28] what are you placing your confidence in?
[1959.18 → 1961.52] What will justify you before God?
[1963.30 → 1966.64] When Jesus says, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit,
[1967.24 → 1968.72] he is saying to you and to me,
[1968.72 → 1972.16] I have completed the work that is necessary for you
[1972.16 → 1976.00] to have a father-child relationship with God.
[1977.36 → 1980.62] And our confidence should never be in what we bring to the table.
[1981.66 → 1986.74] Our confidence should always be in what Jesus so confidently accomplished.
[1988.30 → 1991.14] You know, Leonardo da Vinci was one of the greatest artists that ever lived,
[1991.36 → 1993.74] and he can say that his work was incomplete.
[1994.22 → 1995.52] It was not satisfactory.
[1995.52 → 2000.68] He knew that he did not achieve what his heart had hoped to achieve.
[2001.86 → 2003.94] So his life came to an end with him saying,
[2004.08 → 2008.06] Lord, forgive me for not accomplishing all that I should have accomplished.
[2009.08 → 2015.40] But I am so grateful that it is Christ's work that opens the door to life and not mine.
[2016.38 → 2020.32] And we find confidence in his confidence,
[2021.06 → 2022.64] in his completed work.
[2022.64 → 2028.16] Secondly, Jesus was confident in his father's care.
[2029.40 → 2033.04] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[2034.80 → 2037.34] This just makes me think of a little child
[2037.34 → 2042.06] falling asleep in their father's arms.
[2043.48 → 2045.72] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[2045.72 → 2050.18] And I think there's an interesting contrast in this passage,
[2050.18 → 2054.84] because Jesus had voluntarily delivered himself into the hands of men.
[2056.70 → 2061.10] Speaking to his disciples in Matthew 26, verse 45,
[2061.32 → 2061.90] Jesus says,
[2062.26 → 2064.44] Look, the hour has come,
[2064.64 → 2066.70] and the Son of Man is delivered,
[2067.06 → 2067.56] where?
[2067.56 → 2071.10] delivered into the hands of sinners.
[2072.74 → 2075.10] And it's by the hands of sinners
[2075.10 → 2079.14] that he experienced so much pain and violence
[2079.14 → 2080.64] and so much anguish.
[2081.84 → 2083.24] But then there comes a time
[2083.24 → 2085.36] when the hands of men can do nothing more to him,
[2086.30 → 2088.68] and God's hands have the final say,
[2089.22 → 2091.08] and hear Jesus entrusts himself
[2091.08 → 2092.38] into the hands of God.
[2092.38 → 2095.38] So what about you?
[2097.14 → 2098.88] Have you trusted
[2098.88 → 2101.36] your eternal soul
[2101.36 → 2103.14] into the hands of God the Father?
[2104.82 → 2108.20] The Apostle Paul writes in 2 Timothy 1, verse 12,
[2108.30 → 2110.30] about his confidence before God.
[2110.98 → 2111.34] He says,
[2111.52 → 2112.98] I know whom I have believed,
[2113.14 → 2114.64] and I am convinced
[2114.64 → 2117.02] that he is able to guard
[2117.02 → 2118.92] what I have entrusted him
[2118.92 → 2120.12] until that day.
[2120.12 → 2123.16] Paul here is talking about two things.
[2123.26 → 2123.88] He's talking about
[2123.88 → 2125.16] the message of the gospel,
[2125.66 → 2127.62] but he's also talking about his own life.
[2128.40 → 2128.88] Paul says,
[2129.34 → 2130.82] I can entrust my life
[2130.82 → 2132.06] to God's care.
[2134.58 → 2135.10] Friends,
[2135.20 → 2137.20] if you have entrusted your spirit
[2137.20 → 2138.60] into the hands of God
[2138.60 → 2139.82] like Jesus does here,
[2140.32 → 2142.54] it is absolutely in safe hands.
[2143.22 → 2144.96] So much so that Jesus can say
[2144.96 → 2146.94] of Christians in John 10, 29,
[2146.94 → 2149.44] my Father who has given them to me
[2149.44 → 2150.90] is greater than all,
[2151.16 → 2153.34] no one can snatch them
[2153.34 → 2154.54] out of my Father's hands.
[2157.14 → 2159.00] We can have that same confidence
[2159.00 → 2161.38] as we commit our spirits
[2161.38 → 2162.26] to God our Father.
[2164.58 → 2165.82] So Jesus was confident
[2165.82 → 2166.56] that he had finished
[2166.56 → 2167.44] his Father's work
[2167.44 → 2169.72] and that he could then commit
[2169.72 → 2170.38] his spirit
[2170.38 → 2172.04] to the care of his Father.
[2172.64 → 2173.12] And lastly,
[2173.26 → 2174.52] Jesus was confident
[2174.52 → 2176.04] in where he was going.
[2176.04 → 2178.80] The night of his betrayal,
[2179.62 → 2181.10] when he was celebrating
[2181.10 → 2182.68] the Passover with his disciples,
[2183.30 → 2184.60] it says in John 13,
[2185.66 → 2187.42] Jesus knew that the Father
[2187.42 → 2188.62] had put all things
[2188.62 → 2189.68] under his power,
[2190.28 → 2191.78] that he had come from God,
[2191.82 → 2192.88] and that he was returning
[2192.88 → 2194.16] to God.
[2195.94 → 2197.34] So when Jesus says,
[2198.34 → 2199.16] Father, into your hands
[2199.16 → 2200.12] I commit my spirit,
[2200.24 → 2201.46] he knew exactly
[2201.46 → 2203.54] where he was going.
[2203.54 → 2205.38] He was confident
[2205.38 → 2206.28] that he was going to
[2206.28 → 2208.46] return to the Father's right hand,
[2208.52 → 2209.70] that he was going home
[2209.70 → 2212.38] to the presence of God.
[2214.00 → 2216.36] Do you have the same confidence
[2216.36 → 2217.42] Jesus had
[2217.42 → 2218.80] that you know
[2218.80 → 2219.76] where you are going?
[2221.00 → 2223.00] So many people go through life
[2223.00 → 2224.06] with a lack
[2224.06 → 2225.42] of confidence
[2225.42 → 2227.70] because they don't know
[2227.70 → 2228.72] their eternal destiny.
[2229.44 → 2230.72] Sometimes even Christians
[2230.72 → 2231.56] struggle with this.
[2231.56 → 2233.76] But if you put
[2233.76 → 2234.86] your confidence
[2234.86 → 2236.26] in Jesus' finished work,
[2236.58 → 2237.84] and you entrust yourself
[2237.84 → 2239.14] to God as your heavenly Father,
[2239.84 → 2241.26] you know where you are going.
[2242.30 → 2243.18] And you can know
[2243.18 → 2243.76] where you're going
[2243.76 → 2244.92] because Jesus was
[2244.92 → 2246.12] our trailblazer.
[2246.74 → 2247.50] He was the one
[2247.50 → 2248.62] who went before us.
[2248.86 → 2250.20] He pioneered the way.
[2251.94 → 2253.82] Hebrews 6, verse 19,
[2253.94 → 2254.34] it says,
[2254.78 → 2256.12] We have this hope
[2256.12 → 2257.50] as an anchor
[2257.50 → 2259.26] for the soul.
[2259.64 → 2260.44] I love that phrase.
[2260.44 → 2260.54] It says,
[2261.24 → 2261.90] An anchor
[2261.90 → 2263.30] for the soul.
[2264.00 → 2265.46] Firm and secure.
[2266.12 → 2266.84] It enters
[2266.84 → 2268.20] the inner sanctuary
[2268.20 → 2269.52] behind the curtain
[2269.52 → 2271.60] where our forerunner,
[2271.74 → 2271.96] Jesus,
[2272.74 → 2273.52] has entered
[2273.52 → 2274.58] on our behalf.
[2276.52 → 2277.72] When Jesus cried,
[2277.82 → 2278.42] It is finished,
[2278.46 → 2279.48] in the Gospel of Mark,
[2279.54 → 2280.06] it tells us
[2280.06 → 2280.68] that the curtain
[2280.68 → 2281.24] in the temple
[2281.24 → 2282.82] was torn in two
[2282.82 → 2284.64] from top to bottom.
[2285.62 → 2286.52] And in the pictures,
[2286.66 → 2288.32] Jesus has torn
[2288.32 → 2289.34] the wall apart
[2289.34 → 2290.52] that separated us
[2290.52 → 2292.14] from our heavenly Father.
[2292.32 → 2294.02] We now have total access
[2294.02 → 2294.84] to the Father
[2294.84 → 2296.52] through Jesus' death.
[2297.78 → 2298.34] And Jesus,
[2298.50 → 2299.54] crying out these words,
[2299.66 → 2299.90] Father,
[2300.06 → 2300.74] into your hands
[2300.74 → 2301.72] I commit my spirit,
[2302.28 → 2303.08] is showing us
[2303.08 → 2304.14] that this relationship
[2304.14 → 2305.60] is now possible for us.
[2306.56 → 2309.26] We too can call God Father.
[2309.26 → 2309.36] Father,
[2310.12 → 2311.04] and we can know
[2311.04 → 2311.86] as we face
[2311.86 → 2312.80] our own deaths
[2312.80 → 2314.94] that we are going home.
[2317.94 → 2319.28] So I want to close
[2319.28 → 2320.00] with a story
[2320.00 → 2321.72] about the death
[2321.72 → 2322.80] and the last words
[2322.80 → 2324.66] of Lady Jane Grey.
[2325.66 → 2326.62] Lady Jane Grey
[2326.62 → 2328.40] was an 18-year-old girl
[2328.40 → 2330.42] who was a Protestant.
[2330.42 → 2333.38] And in 1553,
[2333.38 → 2334.62] she was proclaimed
[2334.62 → 2336.46] to be the Queen of England
[2336.46 → 2338.64] at 18 years old.
[2339.90 → 2341.20] But her reign lasted
[2341.20 → 2343.20] a mere nine days.
[2343.94 → 2345.40] Because Mary Tudor,
[2345.86 → 2346.80] who's commonly known
[2346.80 → 2347.62] as Bloody Mary,
[2348.30 → 2348.84] took over,
[2349.78 → 2350.30] sentenced her
[2350.30 → 2351.28] to death for treason,
[2352.26 → 2353.14] death by beheading
[2353.14 → 2353.84] by an axe.
[2355.70 → 2356.68] And I think
[2356.68 → 2357.98] she is a glorious example
[2357.98 → 2358.46] of someone
[2358.46 → 2359.58] who looked at
[2359.58 → 2361.18] how Christ died
[2361.18 → 2362.90] and followed
[2362.90 → 2364.50] his example
[2364.50 → 2365.40] in her death.
[2366.06 → 2366.96] Because on the day
[2366.96 → 2367.68] of her execution,
[2367.82 → 2368.38] after placing
[2368.38 → 2370.02] her own head
[2370.02 → 2370.80] on the block,
[2371.32 → 2371.98] as she waited
[2371.98 → 2372.66] for the axe,
[2372.76 → 2373.82] her last words were,
[2373.82 → 2374.22] Lord,
[2374.56 → 2376.14] into thy hands
[2376.14 → 2378.06] I commend my spirit.
[2379.06 → 2380.02] Repeating the words
[2380.02 → 2380.50] of Jesus.
[2381.86 → 2382.20] And then when
[2382.20 → 2383.12] the executioner
[2383.12 → 2384.16] swung the axe
[2384.16 → 2384.90] and Jane's body
[2384.90 → 2385.46] was dead,
[2386.64 → 2387.44] her spirit
[2387.44 → 2388.62] was still safe
[2388.62 → 2389.18] in the hands
[2389.18 → 2390.72] of her father,
[2391.42 → 2392.04] the Lord.
[2394.04 → 2394.74] See, on the cross
[2394.74 → 2395.62] not only did Jesus
[2395.62 → 2396.32] open the door
[2396.32 → 2396.94] to salvation,
[2397.76 → 2398.60] but he has given
[2398.60 → 2399.50] each one of us
[2399.50 → 2400.08] as Christians
[2400.08 → 2401.48] the very last things
[2401.48 → 2402.14] we also need
[2402.14 → 2402.94] in the Christian life.
[2403.24 → 2403.88] He teaches us
[2403.88 → 2404.62] how to die well.
[2407.20 → 2408.02] When you come
[2408.02 → 2408.48] to the end
[2408.48 → 2409.26] of your life,
[2409.96 → 2410.68] what will your
[2410.68 → 2411.48] last words be?
[2411.48 → 2415.00] I pray that
[2415.00 → 2416.42] whatever you may say
[2416.42 → 2417.68] that in your heart
[2417.68 → 2418.24] you would have
[2418.24 → 2418.88] the confidence
[2418.88 → 2420.44] through Jesus Christ
[2420.44 → 2421.22] to be able to say,
[2421.94 → 2422.14] Father,
[2422.30 → 2423.08] into your hands
[2423.08 → 2424.40] I commit my spirit
[2424.40 → 2425.76] and have that
[2425.76 → 2426.66] same confidence
[2426.66 → 2428.44] that Jesus had
[2428.44 → 2429.68] and that through him
[2429.68 → 2430.68] that we can also have.
[2431.46 → 2432.10] Let's pray.
[2436.00 → 2436.56] Father,
[2436.66 → 2437.12] we thank you
[2437.12 → 2438.06] for our Lord Jesus
[2438.06 → 2440.18] who not only
[2440.18 → 2441.04] was the eternal
[2441.04 → 2441.80] son of God
[2441.80 → 2442.42] who came
[2442.42 → 2443.40] and gave his life,
[2443.48 → 2443.96] but even
[2443.96 → 2445.96] in his death
[2445.96 → 2447.60] he was the perfect
[2447.60 → 2449.02] son of man.
[2450.18 → 2450.98] That with
[2450.98 → 2452.96] such confidence
[2452.96 → 2454.30] he was able
[2454.30 → 2455.74] to entrust himself
[2455.74 → 2456.84] into the hands
[2456.84 → 2457.44] of his father.
[2459.28 → 2459.60] And Father,
[2459.74 → 2460.56] we thank you
[2460.56 → 2461.50] that through Christ
[2461.50 → 2462.30] we can have
[2462.30 → 2463.26] that same confidence
[2463.26 → 2464.86] and that
[2464.86 → 2465.86] that can change
[2465.86 → 2466.82] the way we live
[2466.82 → 2467.32] now
[2467.32 → 2469.04] we can experience
[2469.04 → 2470.04] heaven on our way
[2470.04 → 2470.44] to heaven
[2470.44 → 2471.50] by keeping heaven
[2471.50 → 2473.72] before our eyes.
[2475.02 → 2475.90] We thank you,
[2476.00 → 2476.16] Lord,
[2476.76 → 2477.58] in Jesus' name.
[2477.94 → 2478.18] Amen.
[2479.70 → 2480.62] Let's stand
[2480.62 → 2481.58] and let's sing
[2481.58 → 2483.02] O to See the Dawn.
[2484.36 → 2485.10] Please rise.
[2485.10 → 2497.86] O to See the Dawn
[2497.86 → 2501.82] of the darkest day,
[2501.82 → 2519.54] Christ on the road
[2519.54 → 2523.08] to Galilee.
[2523.08 → 2524.70] Christ below
[2524.70 → 2539.18] Dried by sinful men, torn and beaten men, nailed to our cross of wood.
[2539.18 → 2569.16] This the blood of the cross, Christ's grace in frost, took the blame for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[2569.18 → 2586.52] Oh, to see the pain written on your face, bearing the awesome weight of sin.
[2586.52 → 2600.52] Every bitter thought, every evil deed, crowning a blasting brow.
[2600.52 → 2628.52] This the blood of the cross, Christ's grace in frost, took the blame for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[2628.52 → 2649.52] Now the dead like trees, now the crown beneath, which the sick's maker bows his head.
[2649.52 → 2663.52] Curtain torn in two, dead or raised to life, finish the victory cry.
[2663.52 → 2691.52] This the blood of the cross, Christ's grace in frost, took the blame for the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross.
[2691.52 → 2694.52] The blood of the cross.
[2695.52 → 2703.52] Oh, to see my name written in the wounds.
[2703.52 → 2711.52] For through your suffering, I am free.
[2711.52 → 2715.52] Death is crushed to death.
[2715.52 → 2719.52] Life is mine to live.
[2719.52 → 2733.52] What through your selfless love.
[2733.52 → 2742.92] Son of God, sing for us.
[2743.82 → 2749.40] What a love, what a God.
[2749.40 → 2757.42] We stand forgiven at the cross.
[2763.52 → 2788.38] Giver of life, we wait with you to offer the hope that comes from the cross to earth's
[2788.38 → 2795.38] the darkest places, where pain is deep and affection is denied.
[2795.38 → 2799.38] Let love break through.
[2799.38 → 2803.38] Where justice is destroyed.
[2803.38 → 2808.38] Let sensitivity to Christ spring on.
[2808.38 → 2811.38] Where hope is crucified.
[2811.38 → 2815.38] Let faith persist.
[2815.38 → 2818.38] Where peace has no chance.
[2818.38 → 2822.38] Let passion live on.
[2822.38 → 2826.38] Where truth is trampled underfoot.
[2826.38 → 2830.38] Let sorrow continue.
[2830.38 → 2833.38] Where fear paralyzes.
[2833.38 → 2838.38] Let forgiveness break through.
[2838.38 → 2847.38] Eternal God, reach into the silent darkness of our souls with the radiance of the cross.
[2847.38 → 2852.38] O you who are the bearer of all pain.
[2852.38 → 2856.38] Have mercy on us.
[2856.38 → 2858.38] Giver of life.
[2858.38 → 2861.38] Have mercy on us.
[2861.38 → 2863.38] Merciful God.
[2863.38 → 2865.38] Have mercy on us.
[2865.38 → 2866.38] Amen.
[2866.38 → 2890.38] Amen.
[2890.38 → 2903.00] How beautiful the hands that served the wine and the bread and the sons of the earth.
[2903.00 → 2917.96] How beautiful the feet that walked the long dusty roads and the hills to the cross.
[2917.96 → 2942.82] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[2942.82 → 2961.82] How beautiful the hands that stood that took all my sin and bore it instead.
[2961.82 → 2977.68] How beautiful the tender eyes that chose to forgive and never despise.
[2977.68 → 3001.68] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[3001.68 → 3015.42] And as he laid down his life, we offer this sacrifice.
[3015.42 → 3023.60] That we will live just as he died.
[3024.02 → 3029.46] Willing to pay the price.
[3030.38 → 3035.98] Willing to pay the price.
[3035.98 → 3053.80] How beautiful, how beautiful the radiant bride who waits for her groom with his light in her eyes.
[3053.80 → 3056.80] How beautiful, how beautiful.
[3056.80 → 3068.54] When humble hearts give the fruit of pure lies so that others may live.
[3068.54 → 3092.54] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[3092.54 → 3104.32] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful the feet that breathe.
[3104.32 → 3111.50] The sound of good news and the love of the King.
[3111.50 → 3141.48] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful.
[3141.48 → 3148.48] How beautiful is the body of Christ.
[3148.48 → 3154.48] How beautiful is the body of Christ.
[3154.48 → 3160.48] How beautiful is the body of Christ.
[3160.48 → 3183.48] How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful.
[3183.48 → 3187.48] Come now to the Lord's table on this Good Friday.
[3187.48 → 3190.48] This meal, of course, was instituted by the Lord Jesus.
[3190.48 → 3191.48] This meal, of course, was instituted by the Lord Jesus.
[3191.48 → 3197.48] And is the fulfillment of all the Passovers that the Jews have observed before that.
[3197.48 → 3204.48] And so there is a need to come to this table with faith for it to be efficacious for us.
[3204.48 → 3207.48] For it to have the effect it's meant to.
[3207.48 → 3217.48] So if you are here this morning, but you have not been baptized into the Lord Jesus and have not yet received by faith the finished work of Christ for you.
[3217.48 → 3219.48] We are glad that you are here.
[3219.48 → 3222.48] But this table is not yet for you.
[3222.48 → 3227.48] For dear ones, the Lord Jesus, in the night before he died, he took bread.
[3227.48 → 3229.48] After giving thanks, he broke it.
[3229.48 → 3231.48] And he said to his disciples,
[3231.48 → 3234.48] Take, eat.
[3234.48 → 3236.48] This is my body given for you.
[3236.48 → 3238.48] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3238.48 → 3242.48] The same night, Jesus took the cup, saying,
[3242.48 → 3249.48] This cup is the new covenant sealed in my blood, shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.
[3249.48 → 3253.48] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3253.48 → 3260.48] Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, the people of God.
[3260.48 → 3270.48] Feed on him in your hearts by faith, and with Thanksgiving, remembering that Jesus died for you because he loves you.
[3270.48 → 3275.48] May I ask our elders and deacons who are serving to please come forward.
[3290.48 → 3306.48] Lord Jesus, please come forward.
[3306.48 → 3307.48] Amen.
[3307.48 → 3309.48] Amen.
[3309.48 → 3311.48] Amen.
[3311.48 → 3312.48] Amen.
[3312.48 → 3315.48] Amen.
[3315.48 → 3317.48] Amen.
[3317.48 → 3318.48] Amen.
[3347.48 → 3349.48] Amen.
[3377.48 → 3379.48] Amen.
[3407.48 → 3409.48] Amen.
[3437.48 → 3438.48] Amen.
[3462.20 → 3467.24] People of God, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was broken for you.
[3467.48 → 3468.48] Amen.
[3497.48 → 3498.48] Amen.
[3498.48 → 3499.48] Amen.
[3499.48 → 3500.48] Amen.
[3500.48 → 3501.48] Amen.
[3501.48 → 3502.48] Amen.
[3503.48 → 3504.48] Amen.
[3504.48 → 3505.48] Amen.
[3505.48 → 3506.48] Amen.
[3506.48 → 3507.48] Amen.
[3507.48 → 3508.48] Amen.
[3508.48 → 3509.48] Amen.
[3509.48 → 3510.48] Amen.
[3510.48 → 3511.48] Amen.
[3511.48 → 3512.48] Amen.
[3512.48 → 3513.48] Amen.
[3513.48 → 3514.48] Amen.
[3543.48 → 3544.48] Amen.
[3573.48 → 3575.48] Amen.
[3603.48 → 3604.48] Amen.
[3633.48 → 3634.48] Amen.
[3648.48 → 3655.58] Brothers and sisters, take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for us.
[3655.58 → 3663.58] Amen.
[3663.58 → 3667.58] Please join me in prayer.
[3667.58 → 3682.58] Thank you, loving God, for sending to us your Son, Jesus, to whom we belong, body and soul, in life and in death, and who bore our infirmities and carried our sorrows.
[3682.58 → 3694.58] Thank you, loving God, for sending to us your Son, Jesus, who became sin for us and suffered the punishment due to us, that we might stand forgiven at the cross.
[3695.58 → 3697.58] In Jesus' name we pray.
[3697.58 → 3698.58] Amen.
[3698.58 → 3702.58] So please remain seated.
[3702.58 → 3708.58] We will sing our final song, O Sacred Head Now Wounded.
[3708.58 → 3715.58] And it is traditional, I think, to not have a word of benediction on Good Friday.
[3716.58 → 3723.58] But please do, after the song, remain seated for as long as you'd like and have a time of silent prayer and meditation.
[3723.58 → 3726.58] And then also, please leave in silence.
[3726.58 → 3741.58] O Sacred Head Now Wounded,
[3741.58 → 3759.58] With grief and shame weighed down, Now scornfully surrounded, With grief and shame weighed down,
[3759.58 → 3783.58] Now scornfully surrounded, With thorns your holy crown, O Sacred Head of glory, And blessing you have known.
[3783.58 → 3796.58] Yet though despised and glory, I cleared you as my own.
[3796.58 → 3809.58] My Lord, what you did suffer, Was of our sinners' gain.
[3809.58 → 3822.58] My mind was a transgression, But yours the deadly pain.
[3822.58 → 3835.58] So here I kneel, my Saviour, For I deserve your place.
[3835.58 → 3848.58] Look on me with your favour, And sing me by your praise.
[3848.58 → 3861.58] What language shall I borrow, To thank you dear O'er pain?
[3861.58 → 3874.58] For this your dying sorrow, Your mercy without end.
[3874.58 → 3886.58] Lord, make me yours forever, A loyal servant true.
[3886.58 → 3901.58] And let me never, never Outlive my love for you.
[3901.58 → 3908.58] So Lord, that you friend.
[3908.58 → 3912.58] Stop talking.
[3912.58 → 3914.58] WO Все from here.
[3914.58 → 3919.58] Let me know tribes.
[3919.58 → 3928.58] When you learn my live hymn of life, Let me know our love!
[3928.58 → 3958.56] Thank you.
