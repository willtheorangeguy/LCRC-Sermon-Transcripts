[380.66 → 381.66] Good morning.
[381.66 → 382.66] Good morning.
[382.66 → 387.66] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[387.66 → 390.66] It's great to be here together to worship the Lord.
[390.66 → 396.66] We especially welcome newcomers and those who are here to witness the baptism of little William.
[396.66 → 407.66] And so I was reminded this week that Ladder CRC is but a small part of God's church, both through time across the centuries and in space.
[407.66 → 412.66] And as part of this global church, we keep the church calendar.
[412.66 → 418.66] But wherever you find the local church, it also keeps the local calendar.
[418.66 → 423.66] And so today we are celebrating that it is Father's Day.
[423.66 → 426.66] So happy Father's Day.
[430.66 → 431.66] Thank you.
[431.66 → 436.66] I do hope that it is an occasion of real joy.
[436.66 → 441.66] But I was also reminded this week that in the gospel every day is Father's Day.
[441.66 → 444.66] Because we have a loving and gracious Heavenly Father.
[444.66 → 450.66] And so today let's love, let's thanks, let's forgive our earthly fathers.
[450.66 → 456.66] But also let's together adore and love and trust and worship our Abba Father.
[456.66 → 462.66] There are also many other things going on today.
[462.66 → 467.66] So as I mentioned, we are celebrating a baptism, the baptism of Jason and Michaela's little boy William.
[467.66 → 474.66] Today we welcome Ajee and Anne who serve in Egypt.
[474.66 → 480.66] And they are, we partner with them as a church in their ministry there.
[480.66 → 486.66] And right after the service, we will be having lunch, soup and buns together in the fellowship hall.
[486.66 → 490.66] Where they will have an opportunity to speak about their ministry.
[490.66 → 493.66] So we can find out what's going on in that part of the world.
[493.66 → 495.66] Also, Ajee will be preaching for us today.
[495.66 → 503.66] Oh, and also I wanted to announce so we can all celebrate together that Anne, where's Anne?
[503.66 → 504.66] I haven't met Anne yet, hi.
[504.66 → 509.66] Recently graduated with her doctorate degree from Fuller Theological Seminary.
[509.66 → 512.66] So praise the Lord for that.
[517.66 → 520.66] And also today, no there's more.
[520.66 → 524.66] The CRC has designated today Indigenous Ministries Day.
[524.66 → 528.66] There's not a lot we can do today to recognize that day.
[528.66 → 536.66] But we are, our designated offering is for the missionaries that we support with Native American Indigenous missionaries.
[536.66 → 539.66] So we'll speak about that later.
[539.66 → 544.66] Lastly, today, later in the service, we will have a drawing of lots.
[544.66 → 549.66] All three deacon candidates received the affirmation of this congregation.
[549.66 → 555.66] But we will draw lots to select two deacons who will then serve on the church council.
[555.66 → 556.66] Okay.
[558.66 → 565.66] So now, let's prepare our hearts to come before our Heavenly Father in worship.
[565.66 → 571.66] Here to call the worship, and I invite you to say it with me, where it's bolded and there's the double arrow.
[571.66 → 573.66] This is from Psalm 104.
[573.66 → 576.66] Oh Lord, how manifold are your works!
[576.66 → 578.66] In wisdom you have made them all.
[578.66 → 581.66] The earth is full of your creatures.
[581.66 → 586.66] When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
[586.66 → 590.66] When you send your spirit, they are created.
[590.66 → 592.66] And you renew the face of the ground.
[592.66 → 598.66] Oh come, let us bless the Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[598.66 → 601.66] Please join me in a prayer of adoration.
[603.66 → 607.66] Three in one, one in three, God of our salvation.
[607.66 → 610.66] This morning we gather to praise and worship you.
[610.66 → 617.66] Heavenly Father, you lead us from delusion to truth and into your righteous ways.
[617.66 → 624.66] Christ our Saviour, you lead us from darkness to light and into your gracious will.
[624.66 → 631.66] Spirit of creation, you lead us from death to life and into your joyful presence.
[631.66 → 635.66] Triune God, creator and sustainer of us all.
[635.66 → 638.66] It is you we worship and adore.
[638.66 → 641.66] We pray in the name of Jesus our Lord.
[641.66 → 642.66] Amen.
[642.66 → 646.66] Brothers and sisters, would you please rise in body or in spirit.
[647.66 → 650.66] God greets us with these words from Zephaniah.
[650.66 → 651.66] God greets us with these words from the Lord.
[651.66 → 656.66] They will call upon my name and I will answer them.
[656.66 → 658.66] I will say they are my people.
[658.66 → 663.66] And they will say, the Lord is my God.
[663.66 → 668.66] The Lord having greeted us and welcomed us this morning, why don't we turn and greet one another.
[668.66 → 676.64] And we will guy so much, and let's thank you all, my dear grace be amazed and

[1052.00 → 1062.00] just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father so too we can walk in newness of life

[1341.00 → 1343.00] for the Bible tells me so
[1343.00 → 1346.00] Jesus loves me this I know
[1346.00 → 1348.00] for the Bible tells me so
[1348.00 → 1351.00] little ones to him belong
[1351.00 → 1355.00] they are weak, but he is strong
[1355.00 → 1357.00] yes Jesus loves me
[1357.00 → 1359.00] yes Jesus loves me
[1359.00 → 1361.00] yes Jesus loves me
[1361.00 → 1363.00] yes Jesus loves me
[1363.00 → 1365.00] yes Jesus loves me
[1365.00 → 1380.00] the Bible tells me so
[1380.00 → 1393.00] Jesus loves me
[1393.00 → 1395.00] Jesus loves me
[1395.00 → 1397.00] Jesus love me
[1397.00 → 1399.00] he who died
[1399.00 → 1409.20] He will wash away my sin, let his little child come in.
[1409.64 → 1412.96] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1413.78 → 1417.44] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1418.48 → 1422.02] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1422.38 → 1425.88] The Bible tells me so.
[1425.88 → 1435.88] Jesus loves me, this I know, as he loved so long ago.
[1436.90 → 1444.88] Taking children on his feet, saying, let them come to me.
[1445.98 → 1448.88] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1450.36 → 1453.80] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1453.80 → 1457.80] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[1458.76 → 1462.62] The Bible tells me so.
[1462.62 → 1476.08] So at this time, the little children are invited to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1476.68 → 1480.20] Today, we just have the youngest and middle class, not the older one.
[1480.20 → 1481.24] So I think up to grade five.
[1485.16 → 1485.72] All right.
[1492.86 → 1501.04] So as the children go, we will continue our worship with a time of confession and the assurance of God's grace to us.
[1501.04 → 1508.86] So please join me in this prayer of confession while I will begin, and then I'll ask you to join me.
[1509.86 → 1516.94] Almighty God, who freely pardons all who repent and turn to him, forgive us our sins.
[1517.94 → 1519.54] Cleanse us from an evil conscience.
[1519.54 → 1524.40] We come to you through the perfect sacrifice of Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[1525.08 → 1534.90] Recognizing that though Christ works through us, we left to ourselves are full of pride, quick to judge and slow to forgive.
[1534.90 → 1539.54] Create in us a new heart, O God.
[1540.22 → 1546.46] Make us anew in the image of your son who died so that we might live.
[1547.04 → 1547.42] Amen.
[1548.24 → 1554.64] I invite you to take a moment in the quietness of your own hearts to come before the Lord in a prayer confession.
[1554.64 → 1554.76] Amen.
[1554.76 → 1554.80] Amen.

[1555.00 → 1555.04] Amen.
[1555.04 → 1555.06] Amen.
[1555.06 → 1555.10] Amen.
[1555.10 → 1557.04] Amen.
[1557.04 → 1557.10] Amen.
[1557.10 → 1557.16] Amen.
[1557.16 → 1559.10] Amen.

[1563.16 → 1564.88] Amen.
[1564.90 → 1571.04] Amen.
[1571.04 → 1572.86] Heavenly Father, you know all things.
[1573.86 → 1575.36] Lord, you know our hearts.
[1576.62 → 1581.90] You know the wicked ways that are in each one of us, myself included.
[1583.04 → 1589.26] But Lord, we thank you that even though you invite us to come to you and to confess our sins to you,
[1589.26 → 1597.08] we thank you that in Christ we are forgiven because of his death on the cross on our behalf,
[1597.08 → 1603.72] in his resurrection to eternal life, which we can partake in as we are united to Jesus,
[1603.90 → 1605.86] our Saviour, through faith in him.
[1606.48 → 1608.28] Father, we praise you and we thank you.
[1608.28 → 1610.28] In his holy name we pray.
[1610.28 → 1611.12] Amen.
[1612.56 → 1616.48] Brothers and sisters, hear these words of assurance from Romans.
[1616.48 → 1623.98] You do not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption.
[1625.44 → 1633.96] When you cry, Abba, Father, it is that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
[1634.52 → 1639.20] And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
[1639.20 → 1644.06] In Christ, by the power of the Spirit, we are forgiven.
[1645.14 → 1645.46] Amen.
[1646.70 → 1649.74] Let's sing Holy Spirit, Living Breath of God.
[1649.74 → 1671.22] Purify my heart, let me be as gold and precious silver.
[1671.22 → 1678.62] Purify my heart, let me be as gold.
[1678.62 → 1685.62] Pure gold, refiner's wine
[1685.62 → 1690.62] My heart's one desire
[1691.30 → 1695.62] Is to be holy
[1695.62 → 1701.06] Set apart for you, Lord
[1701.06 → 1705.48] My choose to be holy
[1705.48 → 1711.36] Set apart for you, my Master
[1711.36 → 1716.38] Ready to do your thing
[1716.38 → 1720.64] Purify my heart
[1720.64 → 1722.88] Cleanse me from within
[1722.88 → 1726.80] And make me holy
[1726.80 → 1730.52] Purify my heart
[1730.52 → 1734.00] Cleanse me from my sin
[1734.00 → 1740.88] Deep within, refiner's wine
[1740.88 → 1744.90] My heart's one desire
[1744.90 → 1749.90] Is to be holy
[1749.90 → 1755.22] Set apart for you, Lord
[1755.22 → 1760.10] I choose to be holy
[1760.10 → 1765.22] Set apart for you, my Master
[1765.22 → 1769.16] Ready to do your way
[1769.16 → 1791.32] All right, so this time, let's prepare our hearts for the hearing of God's Holy Word. I will invite
[1791.32 → 1798.20] Ajee Imran to come up, and he will deliver God's Word for us. As he comes up, let me lead us in a prayer of illumination
[1798.20 → 1810.20] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that though the flower fades, your Word stands forever
[1810.20 → 1818.08] Father, we thank you for your Word. We pray for the blessing upon it, the illumination of the Holy Spirit in each one of our hearts
[1818.08 → 1826.08] And Lord for the unction of the Spirit upon Ajee as he expounds your Word to us
[1826.08 → 1831.08] Lord open our ears and our hearts, we pray in Jesus name, Amen
[1831.08 → 1833.08] Amen
[1853.64 → 1855.80] So good morning
[1855.80 → 1866.36] Really, it's a pleasure to be here again. It's been what three years since we were here and lots has happened to all of us
[1867.88 → 1870.68] It has been a full three years
[1871.96 → 1873.08] I
[1873.32 → 1880.84] Can't imagine exactly how it happened, but I would say it was busier than any of the previous seven years
[1880.84 → 1885.00] Actually this summer we celebrate 10 years working with resonate and
[1885.96 → 1889.64] world mission with the CRC in Egypt and
[1890.36 → 1894.60] So there's something special about being able to come and share with you today
[1898.36 → 1904.84] I'm going to share from first Corinthians and from Psalm 119 and I'm going to make you a little deal
[1904.84 → 1911.40] Probably won't like it, but it's its it's pretty good. I'm going to reduce the number of verses
[1912.12 → 1914.12] That I read from first Corinthians
[1914.36 → 1915.80] But I will
[1915.80 → 1920.20] increase the number of verses from first from Psalm 119 so
[1921.32 → 1927.96] But I would like to just begin by reading that passage that is mentioned in first Corinthians
[1929.08 → 1930.36] Looking at chapter 2
[1931.16 → 1933.00] We'll actually just start at verse 7
[1933.00 → 1937.48] We speak
[1939.00 → 1940.76] of God's secret wisdom
[1941.32 → 1947.00] Wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began
[1948.52 → 1948.84] None
[1950.52 → 1952.84] of the rulers of this age understood it
[1953.72 → 1957.32] For if they had, they would not have crucified the lord of glory
[1957.64 → 1961.72] However, as it is written no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind
[1961.72 → 1963.72] No mind has conceived
[1963.96 → 1966.44] What God has prepared for those who love him
[1967.40 → 1971.64] But God has revealed it to us by his spirit
[1974.76 → 1977.00] I'm going to pause there and
[1977.00 → 1983.00] Thank pastor Jason right now for praying that prayer of illumination
[1983.00 → 1990.44] I just read god has revealed it to us by his spirit and Paul is talking about
[1991.24 → 1993.16] god's word and
[1993.16 → 1997.80] The message of god that comes to us and comes through us to others and
[1998.28 → 2003.40] And it is only by grace and by the power of the Holy Spirit that that message
[2004.04 → 2008.60] Actually comes through it is only when the Holy Spirit sheds light
[2009.00 → 2012.12] Illumination I'll keep going the spirit
[2012.12 → 2015.08] The spirit searches like a searchlight
[2016.04 → 2020.28] The spirit searches all things even the deep things of god
[2022.44 → 2027.16] For who among us knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him
[2027.16 → 2032.52] In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of god except the spirit of god
[2033.80 → 2038.68] We have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god
[2040.04 → 2041.24] That so that
[2041.96 → 2045.72] We may understand what god has freely given us
[2047.24 → 2052.28] This is what we speak not in words taught to us by human wisdom
[2052.28 → 2055.16] But in words taught by the Holy Spirit
[2056.28 → 2059.64] expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words
[2061.48 → 2065.40] The man without the spirit does not accept the things that come from the spirit of god
[2066.28 → 2070.20] For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them
[2070.92 → 2073.32] Because they are spiritually discerned
[2074.92 → 2076.04] The spiritual man
[2076.84 → 2079.08] Makes judgments about all things
[2079.96 → 2083.80] But he himself is not subject to any man's judgment
[2084.68 → 2088.52] For who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him
[2090.20 → 2093.48] But we have the mind of Christ
[2096.68 → 2096.92] Now
[2096.92 → 2106.60] I chose this passage because it does sort of highlight it does give us a little bit of a taste of the direction that I want us to go
[2107.40 → 2109.40] As we think about
[2109.64 → 2111.64] The Holy Spirit today
[2111.64 → 2112.52] um
[2112.52 → 2114.52] A couple of weeks ago
[2115.00 → 2117.16] Jason and others at the church were asking
[2117.56 → 2120.04] You know, what are you what are you planning to preach on and?
[2120.92 → 2121.64] You know
[2121.80 → 2125.64] Two weeks ago. We celebrated Pentecost, and so I was starting to think about
[2126.20 → 2128.12] the Holy Spirit and what
[2129.32 → 2130.12] What is it that?
[2131.16 → 2138.44] We maybe have learned like I have experienced about the Holy Spirit over the last year a couple of years
[2139.16 → 2141.16] And as I reflected on that
[2141.88 → 2147.32] The subject that actually I felt like god was pointing me to about the Holy Spirit
[2148.04 → 2151.72] Was the way that god by the Holy Spirit working in us?
[2152.20 → 2159.16] Actually makes his word come alive come to light make sense to us or make sense even to other people
[2160.04 → 2163.72] So I said I know, I want to maybe preach on something to do with that
[2164.52 → 2167.48] and uh, and then I know, I gave this passage as
[2168.20 → 2171.64] one of the passages that I've been working with and
[2172.44 → 2175.64] Psalm 9 119 as well, and we'll come to that
[2176.76 → 2177.88] but I
[2177.88 → 2184.76] Last night I came kind of face to face with an example of what we hear in first Corinthians 2
[2186.04 → 2188.04] that sometimes
[2188.36 → 2189.64] We are
[2189.64 → 2194.92] face to face with words, or we are reading words, but we don't understand
[2195.64 → 2197.64] They don't make any sense
[2197.64 → 2202.28] We were at the rental car company
[2203.88 → 2204.28] and
[2204.28 → 2204.68] uh
[2205.80 → 2207.80] You know, we had just
[2208.52 → 2211.80] Made our trip from actually we visited California
[2213.08 → 2215.80] a little bit of a reunion with ann's family as she was
[2216.36 → 2219.48] graduating and there was a wedding, and then we came
[2220.20 → 2223.48] our flight was delayed like a lot of things were happening
[2224.20 → 2229.96] And it just felt like there was kind of accumulating stress and then my credit card didn't work and
[2230.28 → 2236.68] It you know, it wasn't totally not working, but it was just a mystery why it wouldn't work this one time
[2238.60 → 2239.64] and
[2239.64 → 2242.04] The woman across the person behind the counter
[2243.32 → 2245.96] Had these words tattooed like a necklace
[2247.08 → 2248.68] uh right here on her neck
[2248.68 → 2250.68] And written in Arabic
[2253.08 → 2255.08] Uh something to the effect of
[2256.12 → 2256.28] um
[2256.28 → 2257.08] quill Haifa
[2257.64 → 2258.04] ill
[2258.04 → 2258.84] but hustle
[2260.04 → 2260.68] uh
[2260.68 → 2262.04] Fee ha see
[2262.04 → 2262.92] Does that make sense to you?
[2263.88 → 2270.36] Yeah, and it makes just as much sense to her because she doesn't know any Arabic she said to us, you know, she's actually she knows some Spanish
[2271.08 → 2274.20] Uh, but that didn't she said I want to learn in Arabic
[2274.20 → 2276.76] It you know, it'd be really helpful if I could read this
[2277.48 → 2278.68] But I know what it means
[2279.72 → 2280.76] And it does mean
[2281.72 → 2284.44] Everything that happens for a reason
[2289.64 → 2293.80] What I wanted to I felt like that's a perfect illustration because
[2294.36 → 2300.92] Sometimes we read god's word, or we read the events of stress and challenge that we kind of go through and
[2300.92 → 2308.60] Without a good message kind of coming through it just doesn't result in anything helpful
[2311.40 → 2314.44] Sometimes god's word can be like that we need
[2315.32 → 2325.00] Someone to interpret or to put light or to help us to understand what is being read or what is being lived in life
[2325.00 → 2337.72] Everything that happens for a reason we uh about a month ago had a retreat where we got together our team and this is like our whole Middle East team
[2338.68 → 2346.52] We were on our way to Lebanon from Egypt and one member of our team an Egyptian young man named rams
[2346.52 → 2351.64] And he had to get permission from the authorities, and he had to get permission from the authorities in Egypt
[2351.64 → 2361.16] And he got like I pushed him really hard to get a bunch of things done
[2361.16 → 2363.96] But I hadn't realized that he needed to get permission
[2364.52 → 2366.52] From the authorities in Egypt
[2367.08 → 2371.24] Because he's in the age range where he needs to serve in the military
[2372.04 → 2374.28] He had to get permission to travel
[2375.48 → 2380.76] And so we got to the check-in counter, and you know most of us got through and then there was rams
[2380.76 → 2384.20] He kind of showed up late, and he had some other things that went happened
[2384.44 → 2389.96] But he presented his ticket, and they said actually it looks like you know you don't have the permission to travel yet
[2390.60 → 2395.08] So we can't let you have you know your ticket your uh your
[2396.36 → 2397.64] um
[2397.72 → 2399.72] Whatever the stub thing is
[2401.24 → 2404.92] And he was shocked, and we were shocked, and then they said you know
[2405.40 → 2409.08] You can go and try to deal with it maybe get another flight another day or something
[2409.88 → 2410.52] and
[2410.52 → 2415.48] We were all feeling like what we've been planning on this for I know especially with covid you know
[2415.64 → 2419.16] There are so many things that we had to deal with this was not on our radar
[2420.04 → 2422.04] um
[2422.12 → 2423.24] So
[2423.24 → 2427.96] Ann went into full gear you know trying to phone people that you know might help us
[2427.96 → 2437.80] Uh connections and things and the end result after almost an hour and a half and this was cutting it very close with the flight was that
[2438.68 → 2439.88] miraculously
[2440.76 → 2442.76] Rama's in
[2442.76 → 2444.76] unprecedented time
[2444.76 → 2451.32] And over the phone, and you know digitally and sending things and his brother going and helping pay things and all kinds of stuff happening
[2452.20 → 2455.88] He got the permission, and he was able to join us for that retreat
[2457.40 → 2463.72] And we reflected on that and by the presence of the Holy Spirit we thought everything happens for a reason
[2463.72 → 2465.72] This was a miracle
[2468.60 → 2474.20] This miracle thing of how the Holy Spirit just illumines or puts light on
[2475.08 → 2476.68] circumstances and scripture
[2478.12 → 2483.56] It's its such an important part of our lives that we celebrate it
[2485.24 → 2487.08] Regularly right here
[2487.08 → 2490.84] On this podium every time we're in church
[2491.72 → 2495.56] When the bible is read we hear that prayer of illumination
[2496.28 → 2499.56] Do you notice there are three things up here on this uh stage?
[2500.28 → 2500.60] There's
[2501.48 → 2508.20] Three miracles that are being reminded you're being reminded every week of three miracles, right?
[2508.36 → 2512.04] You've got the miracle that we celebrated this morning the miracle of baptism
[2512.60 → 2513.08] someone
[2513.72 → 2515.16] coming into life
[2516.52 → 2521.64] By faith a gift of grace and faith given to this person
[2522.12 → 2523.72] Maybe it's its a gift in waiting
[2524.04 → 2529.80] But there's a certain miracle that happens, and we pray that that miracle will happen
[2529.88 → 2536.52] And we trust that that miracle actually comes into being, and I heard someone behind me saying after the
[2537.16 → 2539.64] baptism occurred do we clap
[2542.04 → 2547.96] Really we should clap when we hear a miracle when we see a miracle when dramas gets his permission
[2548.68 → 2552.28] When these things in our lives are orchestrated
[2553.64 → 2560.92] That would not be possible if it wasn't for the intervention of god the other thing that we do regularly every month
[2561.64 → 2566.68] Probably with maybe some churches more frequently we celebrate communion, right?
[2567.16 → 2569.16] we
[2569.16 → 2571.16] We say god
[2571.16 → 2575.00] transform this substance into something spiritual
[2576.44 → 2579.16] Let us experience nourishment through this
[2580.04 → 2582.92] It's a miracle, and we pray for that, and it happens
[2583.64 → 2588.44] So when we pray asking god illumine give light to your word
[2589.56 → 2594.20] And we don't just do that when we sit when we talk you know when we hear a sermon
[2595.00 → 2601.00] This is the reminder that says you ought to be doing this we all can be doing this constantly every day
[2603.24 → 2607.64] If you went to psalm 119 one of the verses in that psalm
[2608.44 → 2610.92] he says seven times a day
[2612.44 → 2614.44] I read your word
[2614.44 → 2619.80] I'm going to read the verse, and I'm not going to read that verse
[2619.80 → 2621.56] But I'm not actually going to read
[2622.52 → 2624.84] I'm going to have you read and tell me what you're finding
[2625.16 → 2627.64] Okay a little bit of interaction here for you
[2629.00 → 2632.44] Can everyone skip over to psalm 119
[2633.64 → 2634.44] and help me
[2634.44 → 2636.44] By
[2636.44 → 2638.44] By
[2639.16 → 2641.16] Let's see what page that is for
[2643.00 → 2645.56] 458 in the pew bible
[2647.96 → 2653.80] And the paper bible is more helpful than the app if you're skimming and trying to find
[2654.52 → 2656.52] What I'm asking you for here
[2656.52 → 2664.36] Um, so I encourage you to open one of those paper bibles and look for psalm 119 it happens over several pages
[2665.72 → 2667.16] um
[2667.16 → 2669.88] the longest chapter in the bible and
[2671.24 → 2673.56] Tell me just like shout out words
[2674.20 → 2675.80] that have to do with
[2676.84 → 2678.20] the law
[2678.20 → 2679.08] or
[2679.08 → 2681.24] what is it what are those things that
[2682.12 → 2684.12] the writer
[2684.28 → 2685.88] Is referring to that he's
[2686.84 → 2688.76] reading and reflecting on and
[2689.32 → 2695.64] uh engaging and asking god to give him understanding about can you guys just give me some words
[2698.44 → 2698.92] Decrees
[2700.28 → 2700.92] commands
[2701.96 → 2702.52] precepts
[2703.56 → 2705.56] statutes
[2705.88 → 2706.12] Sorry
[2707.88 → 2708.28] Obey
[2709.32 → 2711.72] I thought you said way is another one
[2711.72 → 2713.72] Yes way
[2715.40 → 2717.48] That's a perfect one. No keep going
[2719.48 → 2719.80] Sorry
[2720.84 → 2721.72] Teach good
[2722.12 → 2728.04] So don't go with verbs go with the things that that god is that god has for us
[2729.88 → 2730.52] Precepts
[2732.68 → 2736.04] Okay delight is more of that verb right and
[2736.04 → 2737.00] And so
[2737.96 → 2741.08] Way truth there's a life there's promises
[2741.96 → 2746.60] I actually went through this and found like 15 16 different words
[2747.56 → 2754.44] Let's see some of the ones that maybe you can find later knowledge judgment god's judgment good judgment
[2754.44 → 2755.24] uh
[2755.24 → 2759.40] God's ways insight understanding statutes
[2760.04 → 2760.36] um
[2762.44 → 2763.40] Your promises
[2764.52 → 2765.72] And your righteousness
[2767.08 → 2769.80] Knowledge so a lot of different things
[2770.52 → 2774.76] And this was really useful and helpful for me to do because
[2775.48 → 2777.96] Usually when I've read psalm 119
[2778.76 → 2781.40] I kind of don't like the writer
[2782.12 → 2784.28] I don't know why but I feel like
[2784.84 → 2786.44] He's he's all focused on
[2787.32 → 2791.88] Holiness and trying to kind of strive and become this like perfect person
[2792.36 → 2798.28] But when you really read it you realize no he's just trying to go deep with god in his word
[2798.92 → 2802.52] And if you read the verbs you come to realize
[2803.80 → 2808.84] He's asking god over and over to give light to this word
[2809.24 → 2811.24] Understanding to this word
[2811.24 → 2813.88] Reality in his life to this word and
[2814.44 → 2820.76] He's striving he's doing some things, but he also recognizes that he's failing he's not doing a lot of things
[2822.28 → 2824.52] It's actually a beautiful psalm
[2825.32 → 2828.12] I haven't spent that much time with this song before
[2829.00 → 2833.64] I encourage you to do that to actually sit with it and go through it and look for
[2834.20 → 2836.52] Some of the things that maybe we'll talk about today
[2837.32 → 2839.24] Because this psalm in some sense
[2840.44 → 2841.48] ought to be
[2841.48 → 2844.04] something that our lives are a reflection of
[2844.60 → 2846.04] uh
[2846.12 → 2851.32] A bunch and you know you could probably take one section at a time and
[2851.32 → 2855.08] And you know because there's about 28 I think Hebrew letters
[2855.72 → 2856.20] um
[2856.20 → 2860.92] And you could take one basically for four weeks in a row and just kind of like
[2861.48 → 2865.24] sit with this psalm for a month and let this sort of shape
[2865.96 → 2867.96] how you approach god's word
[2869.24 → 2873.40] Not just laws but all the parts of god's word
[2874.36 → 2880.68] And how those things begin to infuse your life how you understand god's word
[2881.32 → 2889.96] So I'm going to stop there with the word understanding because in this psalm the word understanding happens seven times
[2889.96 → 2891.96] He says
[2892.52 → 2893.00] He says
[2893.80 → 2901.96] both that he wants understanding, and he sees god's people are being filled with understanding that god gives
[2902.92 → 2904.92] understanding to us
[2904.92 → 2906.76] um
[2906.76 → 2910.36] He is he delights in and is shaped by
[2910.36 → 2911.64] He says
[2911.64 → 2913.56] Having this kind of understanding
[2914.36 → 2922.52] Understanding is kind of the theme of this psalm, and it goes very well with the idea that the Holy Spirit
[2923.32 → 2927.08] gives us understanding puts light on god's word
[2929.32 → 2930.44] So understanding
[2931.32 → 2933.88] In the context of stress
[2933.88 → 2942.20] Whether it's a little thing like you know, you know, we fly in late and the things don't go right with the credit card or a big thing
[2942.20 → 2947.96] Like you didn't see that coming. It was a really important thing that you should have done
[2948.60 → 2954.44] And now like your whole plan is ruined like Rama's had travelling to Lebanon
[2955.56 → 2957.24] or if it's
[2957.24 → 2961.40] These other things that we've been heavy with for years now
[2962.44 → 2965.96] You know like all of that stuff that is in our culture
[2967.08 → 2972.68] That uh and stuff that's in our geography like the stuff of
[2973.88 → 2975.64] You know floods and fires
[2976.20 → 2978.04] This the stuff of disease
[2979.00 → 2981.00] The stuff of division
[2981.24 → 2988.44] Where people are divided over cultural issues and moral issues, and it divides churches
[2989.48 → 2994.60] Even masks divide churches and you just don't know what the right thing to do is
[2996.28 → 2999.72] And you wish it would just be clear and easy
[3002.60 → 3006.76] There are so many things in our lives that we need
[3008.20 → 3010.20] God to shed his light on
[3011.16 → 3012.84] And speak his word into
[3013.64 → 3015.72] To give us understanding
[3018.68 → 3020.92] Understanding of what his will is
[3021.80 → 3023.88] And understanding about how to live
[3024.76 → 3025.96] With understanding
[3027.88 → 3028.60] With peace
[3030.20 → 3032.76] Despite mystery
[3035.24 → 3036.20] Despite division
[3037.72 → 3039.80] To hope to hold on to unity
[3041.00 → 3046.44] It's its it even creeps into family life
[3047.96 → 3049.08] Or work life
[3050.20 → 3050.44] Where
[3051.32 → 3052.36] Relationships
[3053.24 → 3055.48] Just need so much understanding
[3056.28 → 3057.24] So much wisdom
[3061.80 → 3062.76] How do we gain
[3064.20 → 3064.92] Understanding
[3064.92 → 3069.16] Through the power of the Holy Spirit
[3071.08 → 3074.68] I've said you know we should be praying for that miracle
[3074.68 → 3077.16] Not just maybe once a week but
[3077.88 → 3079.48] Maybe seven times a day but
[3080.52 → 3081.80] Like we should really be
[3081.80 → 3090.12] Maybe there's more to this, and I think that part of as I was reflecting on it, and you know reflecting on all the stuff in this psalm
[3090.12 → 3092.76] I thought you know
[3092.76 → 3097.80] There's something that we have in the reform tradition which can maybe help us
[3098.92 → 3099.32] Um
[3100.04 → 3102.60] Help us as kind of way of remembering
[3102.60 → 3106.12] What we can do to help ourselves
[3106.92 → 3107.08] To
[3109.08 → 3110.84] Gain understanding and
[3110.84 → 3115.32] To lean on and to ask the Holy Spirit to help us
[3116.12 → 3117.80] Grow in understanding
[3118.76 → 3121.32] That thing that we have in the reformed tradition is
[3122.04 → 3122.28] Uh
[3123.24 → 3125.08] A thing called tulip
[3125.56 → 3128.76] You guys heard of tulip a few of you raise your hand
[3129.64 → 3131.40] Okay, we've got a few
[3132.28 → 3136.84] Tulip people okay, I'm going to have to explain this let me take a little commercial break
[3136.84 → 3138.84] I
[3144.36 → 3148.68] Was at uh our hosts home this morning
[3150.36 → 3150.52] and
[3150.52 → 3152.52] I
[3153.24 → 3155.80] Happen to be in their bathroom, and they have some tulips
[3157.32 → 3159.08] Okay, this is relevant
[3159.88 → 3161.08] All right
[3161.08 → 3162.60] Tulips in their bathroom
[3163.16 → 3165.56] I don't think they're real but they're always there
[3166.20 → 3171.88] And they're on one side on the other side. They've got if you blow this up this framed picture of
[3172.44 → 3174.84] smelly and company and that's a
[3175.72 → 3182.76] Building that was established in 1895. I don't know you're welcome to talk to the banisters about the history of that
[3183.08 → 3185.08] um
[3185.24 → 3186.12] but
[3186.12 → 3188.12] tulips
[3188.12 → 3195.64] Are a thing that you know they have in Holland, and so they use this as a mnemonic a thing like an acronym
[3195.96 → 3198.52] You know to help you remember some theology
[3198.52 → 3207.56] So the five points of Calvinism and tulip are total depravity
[3208.84 → 3215.16] I'm going to go into this a little bit more and relate it to how we understand or how we can live with
[3215.56 → 3220.28] Growing understanding and depending on the Holy Spirit total depravity
[3220.28 → 3222.28] And so we're going to talk to the people of the Holy Spirit
[3223.40 → 3225.40] Just a second
[3225.40 → 3229.64] Unconditional election limited atonement
[3230.44 → 3231.56] uh
[3231.56 → 3233.56] irresistible grace and
[3234.20 → 3237.64] Perseverance of the saints is that right Jason? Yes, thank you
[3239.56 → 3242.92] It's actually in if you have a gray hymnal it's somewhere in the back in one of those
[3243.48 → 3245.48] Confessions that we have
[3246.52 → 3250.20] But these five things actually are really useful
[3250.84 → 3255.00] Not just for your big heady theology, but your practical daily living
[3256.12 → 3256.84] and
[3256.84 → 3258.44] submitting and
[3258.44 → 3260.44] seeking the Holy Spirit to
[3260.68 → 3266.44] Put light on situations and on god's word to give you understanding
[3267.16 → 3269.32] So let me go into those just really quickly
[3269.96 → 3272.20] Total depravity this has to do with
[3273.00 → 3275.00] This little baby William
[3275.88 → 3282.60] Beautiful and perfect and wonderful, and you know easy to deal with as he may be in some ways
[3285.32 → 3286.76] He isn't perfect
[3287.72 → 3289.88] He's totally depraved
[3290.60 → 3293.88] Okay, he can't choose goodness
[3295.32 → 3298.36] Even if he wanted to even if we trained him perfectly
[3299.00 → 3304.52] He would not be able to choose to be in this good relationship with god and
[3305.32 → 3311.08] Just recognizing that we every single one of us has issues
[3311.80 → 3318.04] has problems has pain has struggles has temptations has personality defects
[3318.04 → 3321.64] This is a really important starting point
[3322.20 → 3323.96] to reading god's word
[3324.60 → 3325.56] to
[3325.56 → 3327.16] being willing to be wrong
[3327.80 → 3329.08] when we read god's word
[3329.80 → 3330.12] and
[3330.12 → 3335.56] That means that then sometimes when there's division in interpretation of god's word
[3336.12 → 3338.12] We come with enough humility
[3338.12 → 3344.12] And we really do depend on god not on ourselves
[3344.84 → 3345.08] for
[3345.08 → 3348.04] helping us understand god's word
[3349.08 → 3351.08] No matter how well educated we are
[3351.08 → 3355.16] No matter how mature we are because Paul uses that word mature
[3355.16 → 3357.88] You know it's for the mature, and you are mature
[3357.88 → 3362.76] And you have the mind of Christ, and you know you sometimes hear some of that stuff
[3362.76 → 3365.72] And you start to think well I've got it I've got the whole thing
[3365.72 → 3367.88] No, you're still totally depraved
[3368.52 → 3369.64] You still need
[3371.24 → 3372.68] A lot of humility here
[3374.04 → 3376.12] So that's the first one the second one
[3377.40 → 3378.84] Unconditional election
[3380.20 → 3382.84] I'm sorry William I'm just going to have to pick on you all morning here
[3385.64 → 3388.28] Unconditional election it means that
[3388.28 → 3391.80] Without meeting any special condition
[3393.24 → 3394.12] We're elected
[3395.00 → 3395.48] To be
[3396.36 → 3397.24] God's children
[3399.00 → 3400.44] We have been
[3401.40 → 3409.88] Included adopted into god's family, and we are treated as sons not as slaves we are free
[3411.24 → 3413.88] We have something that is
[3414.68 → 3416.20] You know it's a mystery
[3416.20 → 3422.92] It's something every person that ever lived wanted, and suddenly it's become a reality for us and
[3423.40 → 3427.32] We ought to live again, you know, it's kind of those two things balance each other
[3427.80 → 3435.72] That on one level we have to keep in mind. We're totally depraved on the other level. We are children of god
[3436.68 → 3444.04] And god the spirit resides within us, and he stays with us, and he's there to help us
[3444.04 → 3447.24] To grow into truth
[3447.24 → 3449.96] To remind us of what Jesus knew
[3451.16 → 3455.40] That's what Jesus telling us in john 14 to 16 about the spirit
[3457.56 → 3460.28] Not only is he the way the truth and the life
[3461.64 → 3467.16] He leads us into by the power of the spirit in us the way the truth and the life
[3467.16 → 3470.76] More and more truth that we never knew
[3471.56 → 3474.44] Continue to bloom in our lives
[3477.08 → 3478.68] The third thing limited
[3479.56 → 3483.16] Atonement only says there is right and wrong
[3485.16 → 3489.72] There it's not relativism there are absolutes there's an actual
[3489.72 → 3499.80] Way of thinking that isn't right and there's an actual way of thinking that is right and so only those who actually submit and
[3500.44 → 3504.76] Live with faith accepting what god's word what is truth
[3505.64 → 3511.88] Only those people actually are atoned for even though the atonement could cover all people we just know
[3512.76 → 3514.76] It's possible to not
[3515.24 → 3518.60] Accept this thing and that's a hard reality
[3519.24 → 3522.04] But this psalm over and over is
[3522.76 → 3531.88] Accepting the fact that there are people working against us speaking against us making fun of us telling us that our way of thinking is weird and wrong and
[3533.56 → 3536.76] If we can't recognize that it makes life
[3536.76 → 3539.64] Too complicated and confusing
[3540.52 → 3546.92] But to know that it is possible that there's a person in front of us or a culture in front of us that is
[3548.20 → 3549.56] against god
[3549.56 → 3551.00] sometimes
[3551.00 → 3558.68] Even if it has some good things going through rep general revelation of god somehow works through culture to shape us and fix us in good ways
[3559.40 → 3561.40] He does he's not doing
[3561.48 → 3563.48] Only what culture wants him to do
[3564.20 → 3568.12] He's not saying that everything about culture is true. No, it's not
[3569.88 → 3571.88] And we need to know that
[3572.68 → 3574.68] It's limited
[3576.20 → 3578.20] The fourth thing
[3578.76 → 3580.76] Irresistible grace and the fifth
[3580.84 → 3584.44] Perseverance of the saints these things are like
[3585.56 → 3592.28] Amazing wonderful realities that even though every day I mess up even though I don't
[3593.16 → 3596.68] Look into god's word seven times a day even though I don't
[3597.72 → 3599.16] thoughtfully
[3599.16 → 3601.16] recognize miracles and
[3601.72 → 3604.20] Understand god's word study god's word
[3605.00 → 3608.12] This is the first time I've actually gone into depth with this passage
[3609.00 → 3613.88] And even though I'm going to mess up this sermon you're not going to take away from it what I wanted you
[3613.88 → 3618.20] God is just taking care of things he assures us
[3619.64 → 3624.20] That he's going to bring his message into every life
[3625.56 → 3627.56] irresistibly
[3627.96 → 3631.64] And he's going to preserve all of us
[3633.96 → 3638.44] Those ideas are in this psalm over and over
[3638.44 → 3641.88] It's a beautiful song
[3641.88 → 3644.36] It'll help you
[3645.40 → 3647.00] To practically think about
[3648.68 → 3649.48] Asking god
[3649.48 → 3650.36] God
[3650.36 → 3651.80] To shed light
[3653.40 → 3655.16] On his word in your life
[3658.20 → 3660.68] This year has been a tough year for me
[3662.20 → 3667.72] And yet it's been like a perfect growing year and a year of assurances
[3668.28 → 3669.48] In ministry in life
[3670.12 → 3670.36] I
[3671.32 → 3671.64] Over
[3672.52 → 3674.60] I would say I would extend it even
[3675.40 → 3677.96] You know through the period of covid
[3678.60 → 3679.32] I would say
[3679.88 → 3683.64] There were many times when I really struggled personally
[3684.60 → 3685.72] To understand
[3687.32 → 3689.40] Why do I struggle with depression or
[3690.12 → 3693.72] Where is this stuff coming from that's like it, you know it comes up and
[3693.72 → 3698.36] Stress brings out some of the worst parts of our personalities
[3700.92 → 3703.32] In my leadership sometimes and
[3704.04 → 3705.72] You're you're struggling
[3706.44 → 3710.20] But god was so faithful, and I felt like
[3710.92 → 3712.12] The more time I
[3713.08 → 3718.92] Brought my full self into god's word with all the mess and the problems and
[3718.92 → 3723.64] The faith the ways that I felt like I just don't have what it takes
[3725.00 → 3729.32] The more faithfully he shed light and helped me to experience
[3730.04 → 3736.20] His assurance his presence his guiding and the relevance of his word
[3738.36 → 3739.24] We need to do that
[3741.96 → 3744.92] Another thing that I noticed this year just in ministry was
[3744.92 → 3751.40] Amazingly that one of my responsibilities it's not a work thing, but you know
[3751.40 → 3755.08] I'm also involved in our local international church
[3756.36 → 3758.92] In the leadership team in the pastoral ministry team and
[3761.40 → 3763.16] We've struggled as a church
[3763.88 → 3769.16] With there's one major issue that's like sort of dividing the congregation
[3769.16 → 3770.92] And
[3771.80 → 3773.80] I've been trying to find like a middle
[3774.76 → 3777.88] But it's really hard, and you know people said to me
[3778.36 → 3781.00] Angie other people haven't managed to do this for like
[3781.56 → 3784.36] Hundreds of years. What makes you think that we can do this as a church?
[3786.44 → 3789.24] But really just struggling and trying
[3790.28 → 3792.52] Reading god's word and trying to
[3793.32 → 3796.44] Hold both sides and trying to understand
[3797.16 → 3801.00] The perspective of others trying to maintain unity
[3801.96 → 3806.92] I like I really felt god opened my eyes and at the same time
[3807.48 → 3810.36] He gave me so much grace and favour with others
[3811.16 → 3814.04] As I was sharing my perspective
[3814.52 → 3818.76] Because they knew that I was really trying to understand at the same time
[3820.04 → 3820.28] So
[3821.16 → 3824.20] Sometimes there's no like clear message in scripture
[3824.20 → 3826.44] Sometimes there is a sort of
[3827.40 → 3832.76] Well in this case yes and in this case yes and both yes, yes, and it's not clear
[3833.88 → 3837.24] But God calls us together to be the body of Christ
[3837.96 → 3840.68] It's hard, and yet I felt like
[3841.48 → 3845.64] By grace I've experienced that in his word this year
[3845.64 → 3851.56] Just one more little snapshot in my experience this year
[3852.12 → 3854.92] I've also had a wonderful time
[3857.40 → 3859.00] Spending time with a new believer
[3859.88 → 3863.48] Not we always call them new believers. It's a person that came from
[3864.20 → 3865.32] um
[3865.32 → 3871.24] uh, you know the majority background and uh, you know, he's quite educated to
[3871.88 → 3877.32] speak against the bible and um, you know leading a lot of other people in that way
[3879.00 → 3880.44] He became a Christian
[3881.32 → 3883.08] And this was what five ten years ago
[3883.80 → 3888.44] I've been working with him and had some wonderful conversations
[3888.44 → 3892.68] And experienced Christ experienced the Holy Spirit
[3893.24 → 3896.60] Illuminating his word as we talk like
[3898.04 → 3905.40] You know that verse in uh, I think it's in Luke Jesus is uh wrapping up the parables of the kingdom, and he says that
[3906.28 → 3908.28] um
[3909.00 → 3911.56] When we read god's word we're like scribes
[3912.92 → 3915.80] Pulling out new treasures and old
[3916.68 → 3920.76] Like things that we've understood and new things
[3921.64 → 3926.84] God brings more and more new things out of his word into our lives
[3927.40 → 3932.36] The more we're willing to bring his word into our lives and into
[3933.48 → 3934.92] every aspect of our lives
[3938.44 → 3942.20] It's hard to do. I have the easy job compared to most of you
[3943.40 → 3945.32] I have a religious occupation
[3946.52 → 3949.56] Right? I don't uh envy any of you
[3950.76 → 3952.20] Except for the nine to five thing
[3955.24 → 3957.40] But I really do believe that
[3958.04 → 3958.76] God wants
[3959.64 → 3960.36] His word
[3961.32 → 3965.08] To come and shed light and to have its place
[3965.08 → 3973.56] And my wife works sort of nine to five but then kind of overlaps with some other nine to fives
[3974.76 → 3980.44] But she has an office, and she has lots of words in her office at her desk
[3981.32 → 3981.72] words
[3982.60 → 3984.20] scriptures
[3984.20 → 3984.68] thoughts
[3986.76 → 3993.00] I feel like that's some of the way that we can do this we can put you know sticky notes on our computers, and we can put them
[3993.00 → 3993.64] on our
[3993.64 → 3994.84] in
[3994.84 → 4000.36] in our car and in all kinds of places that remind us of the things that God is saying and
[4001.24 → 4001.88] teaching us
[4001.88 → 4007.72] I'm not going to ask you to tattoo anything on your body that reminds you especially if it's not in your language
[4007.96 → 4011.40] But like really there are things that you can do
[4012.28 → 4013.40] That will help you
[4013.40 → 4018.76] Like David or whoever actually wasn't David wrote this psalm 119
[4020.20 → 4021.32] Seven times a day
[4022.20 → 4023.40] letting God's word
[4024.12 → 4026.44] come before you and pray
[4027.48 → 4027.80] God
[4028.84 → 4029.80] shed your light
[4030.76 → 4032.52] and let me have understanding
[4034.92 → 4037.80] Help me here in this hard relationship
[4037.80 → 4039.64] Give me wisdom
[4039.64 → 4041.32] Give me grace
[4041.32 → 4045.48] So that's my word god's word to you today
[4047.08 → 4049.16] I trust something will come in
[4050.44 → 4051.24] encourage you
[4052.12 → 4053.64] comfort you challenge you
[4055.48 → 4057.16] That we can live better
[4058.04 → 4058.52] this week
[4059.96 → 4061.96] Would you pray with me?
[4061.96 → 4064.84] Jesus we thank you
[4066.28 → 4069.00] That you do have this miraculous power
[4070.04 → 4070.28] And
[4071.08 → 4072.60] Like those first disciples
[4073.24 → 4074.60] Who were walking on that road
[4075.88 → 4077.48] To Emmaus after your
[4078.04 → 4078.76] resurrection
[4080.60 → 4082.76] You can open our eyes
[4083.32 → 4084.20] To the scriptures
[4085.32 → 4087.32] You can open our minds
[4087.32 → 4091.72] You can give us the mind of Christ
[4092.44 → 4093.08] Your mind
[4093.72 → 4094.76] By your Holy Spirit
[4094.76 → 4096.28] It's a miracle
[4096.28 → 4098.36] Jesus we thank you that you are
[4098.36 → 4099.80] Doing miracles
[4100.60 → 4101.16] Every day
[4101.96 → 4103.32] We thank you for your word
[4104.04 → 4105.56] And we ask Jesus that you
[4107.00 → 4109.72] You are the word the truth and the life
[4109.72 → 4111.00] We ask that you lord
[4111.48 → 4112.44] Would be more
[4113.72 → 4114.92] You would be greater
[4114.92 → 4116.12] And we would become less
[4117.64 → 4119.00] Until we all reach
[4119.56 → 4121.16] Maturity in you
[4123.00 → 4123.80] To your glory
[4125.24 → 4125.88] In your name
[4126.92 → 4136.92] Amen
[4147.32 → 4149.00] Sing
[4149.00 → 4150.00] Amen.
[4179.00 → 4185.00] To renew my heart and make me whole.
[4186.00 → 4191.00] Watch your word to come alive in me.
[4192.00 → 4197.00] Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[4198.00 → 4202.00] Give me passion for your purity.
[4203.00 → 4208.00] Holy Spirit, renew life in me.
[4209.00 → 4218.00] Holy Spirit, come abide within.
[4219.00 → 4223.00] May your joy be seen in all I do.
[4224.00 → 4230.00] Love enough to cover every sin.
[4231.00 → 4234.00] In each thought and deed and attitude.
[4234.00 → 4242.00] Kindness to the greatest and the least.
[4243.00 → 4248.00] Gentleness that solves the path of peace.
[4248.00 → 4254.00] Turn my striving into works of grace.
[4254.00 → 4259.00] Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[4259.00 → 4260.00] Amen.
[4260.00 → 4261.00] Amen.
[4261.00 → 4262.00] Amen.

[4265.00 → 4266.00] Amen.
[4266.00 → 4267.00] Amen.
[4267.00 → 4274.56] Let the nations' birth, giving life to all that God has made.
[4275.56 → 4286.72] Show your power once again on earth, cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[4286.72 → 4299.08] Let the fragrance of our prayers arise, lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[4299.56 → 4309.40] Let in unity the peace of Christ, rain be clear for all the world to see.
[4316.72 → 4330.14] So we continue to worship this morning with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4330.14 → 4341.02] Our designated offering for this morning is for the Johnson family who work with North American Indigenous Ministries up in the interior of BC,
[4341.02 → 4347.20] working with First Nations communities, doing outreach, teaching, and encouraging them.
[4347.86 → 4351.68] So I'll ask the deacons to come forward and collect the offering.
[4351.68 → 4352.76] Um, let's pray about when we are back one me,

[4474.38 → 4476.38] Let's pray together.
[4476.38 → 4484.38] Our Heavenly Father, thank you for being the Father we long for.
[4484.38 → 4490.38] Thank you for being the Father we desperately need.
[4490.38 → 4494.38] Thank you for adopting us as your sons and daughters,
[4494.38 → 4498.38] for making your heart our home,
[4498.38 → 4502.38] and for making Jesus our righteousness.
[4502.38 → 4506.38] Thank you for giving us the spirit of son ship,
[4506.38 → 4511.38] who every day is telling us who we are in Jesus,
[4511.38 → 4517.38] and the spirit that reminds us that we really are your beloved children,
[4517.38 → 4522.38] the spirit that opens up your word to us,
[4522.38 → 4526.38] to teach us you, about you,
[4526.38 → 4530.38] and Lord, to teach us how to be in this world.
[4530.38 → 4535.38] Thank you for being the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
[4535.38 → 4540.38] Lord, we need both in large amounts, compassion and comfort.
[4540.38 → 4546.38] Lord, we need both in our hearts, and the spirit that we are in our hearts.
[4546.38 → 4548.38] Thank you for promising to complete the work you began in us,
[4548.38 → 4550.38] to conform us into the image of your Son.
[4550.38 → 4554.38] And Father, until that day, thank you for only disciplining us in your love.
[4554.38 → 4558.38] Thank you for grace to forgive our earthly fathers,
[4558.38 → 4562.38] none of whom could be or replace you.
[4562.38 → 4566.38] And Lord, help us fathers be the fathers you have called us to be.
[4566.38 → 4574.38] So Father, we do pray for the earthly fathers today as we celebrate Father's Day.
[4574.38 → 4578.38] Thank you for these men who lead our children with love.
[4578.38 → 4582.38] We pray that you would grant them wisdom and grace,
[4582.38 → 4588.38] and use them as your ambassadors to the children you've placed in our lives.
[4588.38 → 4596.38] Father, we also pray for those of us who are in broken and painful relationships with our fathers or our children.
[4596.38 → 4606.38] We ask you for your healing and reconciliation through the same power who raised Jesus from the dead.
[4606.38 → 4612.38] Father, we pray for baby William and the rest of the children in our congregation.
[4612.38 → 4619.38] We pray over these little hearts that they would come to know that you are our creator,
[4619.38 → 4625.38] whose power and goodness is used to provide for us and to redeem us from sin and death.
[4625.38 → 4633.38] May our children's identities and worth be forever rooted in the love of their heavenly Father.
[4633.38 → 4640.38] Father, we thank you for Ajee and Anne, for their visit with us today,
[4640.38 → 4645.38] and for the opportunity to hear later on about their ministry in Egypt.
[4645.38 → 4650.38] Lord, we celebrate with them 10 years of ministry there.
[4650.38 → 4655.38] And Lord, for the fruitful work that you have done through them.
[4655.38 → 4660.38] But Lord, we know there are always challenges, setbacks, frustrations.
[4660.38 → 4665.38] So would you sustain them, Lord, in all of their work.
[4665.38 → 4672.38] Father, we pray as a church for some of the needs that we have.
[4672.38 → 4676.38] Father, we especially pray and raise up to you little Richie.
[4676.38 → 4682.38] Father, we just ask, we thank you that he is home now.
[4682.38 → 4689.38] But Father, there is still more healing that needs to happen.
[4689.38 → 4691.38] So we pray for him.
[4691.38 → 4692.38] So we pray for him.
[4692.38 → 4696.38] We pray that his treatments and his recovery would be successful.
[4696.38 → 4699.38] Father, we pray especially for his parents, Cody and Tara,
[4699.38 → 4701.38] grandparents Rick and Roberta.
[4701.38 → 4705.38] Father, we pray for all of them in the midst of this enormous trial,
[4705.38 → 4711.38] that you would comfort them and that your spirit would be especially close to them.
[4711.38 → 4717.38] And Father, also we pray for Angela as she mourns the passing of her father.
[4717.38 → 4726.38] Father, we pray for Angela and Perry as they are kind of back home, being with family.
[4726.38 → 4730.38] Lord, we pray that you would comfort them as they grieve.
[4730.38 → 4734.38] And that you would remind them especially, Lord, of your love for them.
[4734.38 → 4740.38] Father, we thank you that Janet Ram was able to leave the hospital on Friday.
[4740.38 → 4746.38] We thank you that she is home and that you have enabled her to come to a place of healing
[4746.38 → 4748.38] when she was able to leave.
[4748.38 → 4755.38] But Lord, would you continue to heal her in all the different ways that she needs healing.
[4755.38 → 4759.38] Lord, would you give her full recovery of mobility.
[4759.38 → 4771.38] And Father, we also give you thanks and praise for the godly leadership that you raise up for us as a church.
[4771.38 → 4775.38] Lord, by the work of your Holy Spirit, we thank you for our elders and our deacons.
[4775.38 → 4783.38] And Father, as we draw lots today for two deacons, we know that your spirit will be at work.
[4783.38 → 4789.38] And Father, we pray that you would equip them and all of us to join you in your mission in this world.
[4789.38 → 4794.38] Especially, Lord, where we are here in Ladder and in Delta.
[4794.38 → 4799.38] Heavenly Father, your love, kindness, and generosity are overwhelming.
[4799.38 → 4803.38] We love and bless you in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, we pray.
[4803.38 → 4804.38] Amen.
[4804.38 → 4811.38] And so before we receive the benediction and leave, let me call up our chair of council, Joe,
[4811.38 → 4813.38] and he will lead us in the drawing of the ballots.
[4813.38 → 4814.38] Thank you.
[4814.38 → 4816.38] Thank you.
[4816.38 → 4817.38] We are!
[4817.38 → 4823.38] Thank you, Lord.
[4823.38 → 4825.38] Thank you so much for your 여ありがとう.
[4825.38 → 4843.98] So today is a continuation of and really the culmination of the nomination process for
[4843.98 → 4853.06] elders and deacons to serve what generally is a three-year term within leadership in
[4853.06 → 4857.10] this church.
[4857.10 → 4864.58] We mentioned our last week we had the affirmation vote that was taken where we as a congregation
[4864.58 → 4871.72] affirmed the gifts and abilities of the persons that had been nominated.
[4871.72 → 4880.54] One of those persons that was affirmed was Jack Mantra who was the single nominee and
[4880.54 → 4889.76] acclaimed as an elder and what we will now do is we will draw lots as has been our custom
[4889.76 → 4897.58] for a number of years now, draw lots to determine the two deacon nominees that will serve as
[4897.58 → 4902.00] deacons in our congregation.
[4902.00 → 4916.82] Historically, we also let retiring members that will be leaving draw the lots.
[4916.82 → 4918.82] God chooses one deacon.
[4918.82 → 4928.60] Here is Brian Grote endorsed.
[4928.60 → 4933.20] And also the other deacon, the second position would be gone to Elaine Smith.
[4933.20 → 4937.82] Okay, thank you.
[4937.82 → 4947.44] We give thanks to God for leading us through this process.
[4947.44 → 4956.80] And we also want to be thankful for those that are retiring.
[4956.80 → 4964.30] Retiring as elders this year will be Harry Van Tull and Marion Van Dried.
[4964.30 → 4971.14] And also retiring as deacons this year will be Rick Henriksen and Peter Flops.
[4971.14 → 4978.30] And we thank God again for the leadership they show.
[4978.30 → 4982.30] Thank you.
[4982.30 → 4985.98] So as a reminder, please do join us right in the fellowship hall through the doors into
[4985.98 → 4986.98] the other room.
[4986.98 → 4993.82] I know there are at least seven pots of soup that are ready to be drunk and buns.
[4993.82 → 5000.22] And we will also hear an update from the Ajee and Ann.
[5000.22 → 5003.80] So I invite you to stand, receive the blessing of God.
[5003.80 → 5007.82] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing upon you.
[5007.82 → 5013.68] May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow
[5013.68 → 5020.68] with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[5020.68 → 5022.68] Amen.
[5022.68 → 5029.68] My friends, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[5029.68 → 5031.68] My friends, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus.
[5031.68 → 5037.68] My friends, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus.
[5037.68 → 5044.68] Do God be the glory now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5044.68 → 5051.68] To God be the glory now and forever, amen.
[5051.68 → 5066.68] To God be the glory now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5066.68 → 5078.68] To God be the glory now and forever, now and forever, amen.
[5078.68 → 5079.68] Amen.
[5079.68 → 5091.68] My friends, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[5091.68 → 5104.68] My friends, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5104.68 → 5106.68] Good sing unto God.
[5106.68 → 5107.68] Oh, may you go in grace and in His own way.
[5107.68 → 5108.68] Thank you, may ma'am for your kingdom.
[5108.68 → 5109.68] May you go in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5109.68 → 5110.68] Amen.
[5110.68 → 5130.68] Si holy, may you go in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5130.68 → 5160.66] Thank you.
[5160.68 → 5190.66] Thank you.
[5190.68 → 5220.66] Thank you.
