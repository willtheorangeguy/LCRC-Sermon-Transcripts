[0.00 --> 15.44]  .
[15.44 --> 23.90]  .
[23.90 --> 28.94]  .
[28.94 --> 29.94]  Amen.
[58.94 --> 59.94]  Amen.
[88.94 --> 89.94]  Amen.
[118.94 --> 119.94]  Amen.
[148.94 --> 149.94]  Amen.
[178.94 --> 179.94]  Amen.
[208.94 --> 209.94]  Amen.
[238.94 --> 239.94]  Amen.
[268.94 --> 269.94]  Amen.
[298.94 --> 302.06]  Good morning.
[302.06 --> 303.06]  Good morning.
[303.06 --> 309.42]  Welcome to Latinx Christian Reformed Church on this beautiful, sunny Sunday morning.
[309.42 --> 310.42]  My name is Jason Truel.
[310.42 --> 313.28]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[313.28 --> 316.12]  And also we welcome everyone who is joining us on livestream.
[316.12 --> 319.58]  So thank you for joining us this morning.
[319.58 --> 321.26]  I also just have a quick announcement.
[321.26 --> 322.40]  Well, two things.
[322.40 --> 327.16]  One is in the seat pocket in front of you, in the pew, you will find a welcome card.
[327.16 --> 332.46]  So if you are new, we'd love to get to know you, to welcome you to our congregation and
[332.46 --> 333.80]  find out how we can serve you.
[333.80 --> 338.78]  So feel free to fill that out with your name and contact information and we will try to
[338.78 --> 340.72]  follow up with you.
[340.72 --> 345.96]  The other thing is, as we've been saying kind of for many weeks now, we have a, our annual
[345.96 --> 351.52]  basic skills camp is back on this summer after a couple of weeks off because of COVID, a couple
[351.52 --> 353.04]  of years off.
[353.04 --> 357.32]  And we have over 55 kids signed up, so we're very excited.
[357.32 --> 361.08]  But there's still a few spots where we could really use some more help.
[361.08 --> 366.38]  And so I encourage you to consider how you might be able to serve.
[366.38 --> 369.98]  And there are some sign up sheets on the foyer table.
[369.98 --> 370.98]  So please do take a look.
[370.98 --> 375.00]  Or if you have any questions about that, you can talk to me, you can talk to Hannah, our
[375.00 --> 378.68]  children's coordinator.
[378.68 --> 382.24]  Let's prepare our hearts to worship this morning.
[382.24 --> 386.80]  Our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 100.
[386.80 --> 392.30]  Part of what it says is this, it says, enter his gates with thanksgiving in his courts with
[392.30 --> 394.90]  praise.
[394.90 --> 395.96]  And we're going to read this whole Psalm.
[395.96 --> 399.32]  It's only a couple of verses in a moment.
[399.32 --> 402.04]  But as we read this, enter his gates with thanksgiving.
[402.04 --> 408.32]  Think about the ancient Israelites as pilgrims going to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
[408.32 --> 412.56]  Think about all believers entering heaven.
[412.56 --> 414.94]  Because this is what we do in worship.
[414.94 --> 416.88]  We draw near to God's presence.
[416.88 --> 422.88]  We actually go to heaven in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[422.88 --> 428.82]  And indeed, through the Spirit, our hearts always remain in heaven, even as our bodies
[428.82 --> 430.14]  walk here on earth.
[431.08 --> 437.68]  It's this sort of mysterious life of the Christian continuing in this life here and now, but knowing
[437.68 --> 439.54]  that we are with Christ in heaven.
[440.34 --> 447.50]  Because as Paul says in Ephesians, God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in
[447.50 --> 449.24]  the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.
[449.24 --> 452.66]  So let's enter heaven together, friends.
[452.96 --> 453.80]  Say this together.
[454.14 --> 454.58]  I'll begin.
[455.26 --> 457.46]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[458.42 --> 460.24]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[460.68 --> 463.82]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[465.58 --> 467.84]  Know that the Lord is God.
[468.40 --> 470.06]  It is he who made us.
[470.46 --> 471.80]  And we are his.
[472.40 --> 473.84]  We are his people.
[474.42 --> 476.30]  The sheep of his pasture.
[476.30 --> 481.76]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[481.88 --> 482.92]  Give thanks to him.
[483.58 --> 484.38]  Praise his name.
[486.00 --> 490.00]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[490.84 --> 494.92]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[495.84 --> 498.10]  Please join me in a prayer of adoration.
[498.10 --> 504.78]  Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the universe, sovereign over all.
[505.84 --> 513.82]  Not by our might, not by our power, but by your spirit do we come to worship you this morning.
[515.28 --> 517.74]  Father, would you send your spirit among us?
[517.74 --> 521.12]  You are the fire.
[521.26 --> 522.24]  We are the temple.
[523.24 --> 524.36]  You are our God.
[524.46 --> 525.50]  We are your people.
[525.98 --> 527.04]  The sheep of your pasture.
[527.56 --> 530.38]  You are holy and we stand in awe of you.
[531.34 --> 535.12]  We praise you, Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[535.24 --> 536.94]  One God, now and forever.
[537.74 --> 538.10]  Amen.
[538.10 --> 540.54]  Brothers and sisters, please rise.
[541.70 --> 549.02]  In spirit or in body, as you are able, and hear this greeting from 1 Peter 5, verses 6-7.
[549.86 --> 561.70]  Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.
[562.96 --> 566.20]  As the Lord has called us and has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another.
[568.10 --> 598.08]  Thank you.
[598.10 --> 598.90]  Amen.
[598.90 --> 599.32]  Amen.
[600.14 --> 600.54]  Amen.
[600.54 --> 600.92]  Amen.
[601.06 --> 602.92]  Amen.
[602.92 --> 603.92]  Amen.
[632.92 --> 633.92]  Amen.
[662.92 --> 664.92]  Amen.
[692.92 --> 694.92]  Amen.
[722.92 --> 724.92]  Amen.
[752.92 --> 754.92]  Amen.
[782.92 --> 784.92]  Amen.
[812.92 --> 814.92]  Amen.
[842.92 --> 844.92]  Amen.
[872.92 --> 874.92]  Amen.
[902.92 --> 904.92]  Amen.
[932.92 --> 934.92]  Amen.
[962.92 --> 963.92]  Amen.
[963.92 --> 964.92]  Amen.
[964.92 --> 966.92]  Amen.
[966.92 --> 968.92]  Amen.
[968.92 --> 969.92]  Amen.
[971.92 --> 973.92]  Amen.
[973.92 --> 974.92]  Amen.
[974.92 --> 975.92]  Amen.
[975.92 --> 976.92]  Amen.
[976.92 --> 977.92]  Amen.
[977.92 --> 982.92]  We continue to worship the Lord by coming to him in a time of confession.
[982.92 --> 986.92]  And our prayer of confession this morning is called the Agnes Dei.
[986.92 --> 988.92]  It's a very simple prayer.
[988.92 --> 989.92]  It's a very ancient prayer.
[989.92 --> 994.24]  and so when we say this we in a sense join the church throughout the centuries
[995.28 --> 1001.76]  of confessing our need for god's mercy so we will say this together and then i will lead us
[1001.76 --> 1009.20]  in a prayer so let's say this lamb of god you take away the sins of the world
[1009.20 --> 1017.76]  lamb of god you take away the sins of the world
[1021.76 --> 1028.64]  lamb of god you take away the sins of the world please pray with me
[1031.20 --> 1038.40]  o generous god you send us the spirit of courage but we have been afraid
[1040.00 --> 1046.48]  you send us the spirit of truth but we so often cling to our illusions
[1048.48 --> 1054.64]  you send us the spirit of healing but we cannot let go of our hurts
[1058.24 --> 1067.36]  father send your holy spirit to come to us again set our souls on fire with your love
[1068.32 --> 1072.32]  and send us out into the world rejoicing in your forgiveness
[1075.28 --> 1080.00]  in this time of confession we hold out to you all of our particular burdens
[1080.00 --> 1095.92]  of guilt sin and shame confessing them before you now
[1095.92 --> 1096.88]  our love
[1096.88 --> 1107.28]  father we ask for your help to live according to your ways your truth and your love through christ
[1107.28 --> 1116.08]  our lord we pray amen and now god promises his forgiveness with these words of comfort
[1116.08 --> 1123.20]  and assurance from first corinthians chapter 5 christ our passover lamb has been sacrificed
[1123.20 --> 1129.36]  for the love of christ let us therefore celebrate the festival not with the old leaven the leaven of malice
[1129.36 --> 1136.00]  and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth praise be to god
[1136.00 --> 1151.92]  in response let's sing a song of praise and response together
[1152.72 --> 1156.72]   genetic
[1156.72 --> 1165.22]  He passed the kingdom of all and his righteousness.
[1167.26 --> 1173.22]  And all these deeds shall be added unto you.
[1175.08 --> 1179.22]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1179.22 --> 1186.22]  As when it shall be given unto you.
[1186.68 --> 1191.16]  Seek and you shall find.
[1192.62 --> 1197.86]  Not that the door shall be opened unto you.
[1198.86 --> 1203.66]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1203.66 --> 1210.98]  We do not live that well alone.
[1211.08 --> 1216.72]  But by every word.
[1217.14 --> 1222.84]  That proceeds from the birth of God.
[1222.84 --> 1227.84]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1227.84 --> 1235.84]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1235.84 --> 1239.84]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1240.84 --> 1247.84]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1247.84 --> 1251.84]  Allelu, alleluia.
[1251.84 --> 1252.84]  Alleluia.
[1252.84 --> 1253.84]  Alleluia.
[1253.84 --> 1254.84]  Alleluia.
[1254.84 --> 1255.84]  Alleluia.
[1255.84 --> 1256.84]  Alleluia.
[1256.84 --> 1257.84]  Alleluia.
[1257.84 --> 1258.84]  Alleluia.
[1258.84 --> 1259.84]  Alleluia.
[1259.84 --> 1260.84]  Alleluia.
[1260.84 --> 1261.84]  Alleluia.
[1261.84 --> 1262.84]  Alleluia.
[1262.84 --> 1263.84]  Alleluia.
[1263.84 --> 1264.84]  Alleluia.
[1264.84 --> 1265.84]  Alleluia.
[1265.84 --> 1266.84]  Alleluia.
[1266.84 --> 1268.84]  So I was meant to dismiss the kids.
[1268.84 --> 1269.84]  So I forgot to do that.
[1269.84 --> 1274.84]  So children, ages three to grade four, if you would like, we have a combined Sunday school
[1274.84 --> 1275.84]  during the summer months.
[1275.84 --> 1278.84]  And so you may go to that.
[1278.84 --> 1284.84]  And for us remaining here, let's prepare our hearts for the reading of God's word.
[1284.84 --> 1309.84]  Today's scripture reading will come to you from, to us, from Ephesians 2 verses 19 to 22.
[1309.84 --> 1313.84]  Please follow along with me as I read for you.
[1313.84 --> 1318.84]  Ephesians 2 verses 19 to 22.
[1318.84 --> 1325.84]  Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people,
[1325.84 --> 1333.84]  and also members of his household, built on the foundation of apostles and prophets,
[1333.84 --> 1338.84]  with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
[1338.84 --> 1347.84]  In him, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[1347.84 --> 1358.84]  And in him, you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[1358.84 --> 1361.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1361.84 --> 1362.84]  Amen.
[1362.84 --> 1375.84]  What an amazing passage.
[1375.84 --> 1379.84]  Let's come before the Lord in prayer together.
[1379.84 --> 1382.84]  Father, we thank you for your word.
[1382.84 --> 1388.84]  We pray that your Holy Spirit who inspired it, the same spirit who indwells us,
[1388.84 --> 1394.84]  would open our minds and hearts to know you through it, and to move us to joyful obedience.
[1394.84 --> 1402.84]  And Lord, I also ask that you might comfort those here this morning who need to be comforted by the gospel that they already know.
[1402.84 --> 1410.84]  And awaken those who need to receive Christ, and to know that only in him is life found.
[1410.84 --> 1412.84]  We ask this in Jesus' name.
[1412.84 --> 1413.84]  Amen.
[1413.84 --> 1418.84]  So this summer, my wife Christi and I have a very new experience.
[1418.84 --> 1422.84]  We sent our four children to the States to visit their grandparents.
[1422.84 --> 1427.84]  So we have been empty nesters for over three weeks now.
[1427.84 --> 1429.84]  They come back next Wednesday.
[1429.84 --> 1432.84]  And we got used to it very quickly.
[1432.84 --> 1436.84]  And they were having a great time with grandparents.
[1436.84 --> 1445.84]  So while they were away, one of the projects I've been wanting to work on this summer is to go through all of our photos from the last 15 years.
[1445.84 --> 1448.84]  You know, they're all on the computer, unorganized.
[1448.84 --> 1451.84]  And so I've been wanting to go through them.
[1451.84 --> 1459.84]  And as I've, you know, taken this trip down memory lane, thinking back to our time in Taiwan, where my family and I were missionaries.
[1459.84 --> 1462.84]  And so we lived in the city of Taipei.
[1462.84 --> 1464.84]  It's this very busy, bustling city.
[1464.84 --> 1470.84]  And one of the things that is always going on in the city is building and construction.
[1470.84 --> 1475.84]  Nearly everywhere you turn, there is something being built.
[1475.84 --> 1483.84]  Cranes, dump trucks, cement trucks, jackhammers, construction workers all the time.
[1483.84 --> 1489.84]  And this actually was a major source of entertainment for the kids when they were young.
[1489.84 --> 1496.84]  And so since I've been missing my children, looking at these photos, I decided I'm just going to share a few of them with you.
[1496.84 --> 1499.84]  Don't worry, it's not too many.
[1499.84 --> 1508.84]  So here they are, very young, looking at this gigantic crane, right, building this big building there.
[1508.84 --> 1515.84]  And the next one, the four of them, looking at this, what is that, a bucket loader?
[1515.84 --> 1516.84]  I don't know the terminology.
[1516.84 --> 1517.84]  But they're checking this out.
[1517.84 --> 1520.84]  And actually right there, they're looking at this construction site.
[1520.84 --> 1523.84]  And they were standing there for so long waiting for the cement truck to come.
[1523.84 --> 1526.84]  So they've got the cement truck and it's filling the hole.
[1526.84 --> 1527.84]  And this is all very exciting.
[1527.84 --> 1529.84]  You know, big moving stuff.
[1529.84 --> 1532.84]  And then the next one is just one more picture.
[1532.84 --> 1534.84]  There they are, sitting in the bucket.
[1534.84 --> 1539.84]  So this is, you know, for kids, very exciting stuff.
[1539.84 --> 1543.84]  Now, I wanted to share this with you because, you know, I miss my kids.
[1543.84 --> 1544.84]  I miss my kids.
[1544.84 --> 1552.84]  But the other reason I'm sharing this with you is because in our passage this morning, there's another kind of building taking place.
[1552.84 --> 1567.84]  In Ephesians chapter 2, verses 19 to 22, Paul is helping us realize that in the midst of all the building that is going on in the world, the living God is actively building something else.
[1567.84 --> 1568.84]  Right?
[1568.84 --> 1583.84]  In every village, every town, every city of the world, God is, through Jesus Christ, building a new dwelling place for himself in the world.
[1583.84 --> 1586.84]  And do you know what that dwelling place is that God is building?
[1586.84 --> 1588.84]  It's the church.
[1588.84 --> 1591.84]  But he's not talking about the building.
[1591.84 --> 1592.84]  Right?
[1592.84 --> 1594.84]  The church meets him.
[1594.84 --> 1596.84]  He's talking about the actual people.
[1596.84 --> 1597.84]  Right?
[1597.84 --> 1599.84]  Where we are sitting right now is not a church.
[1599.84 --> 1601.84]  I mean, we call it that.
[1601.84 --> 1602.84]  But it's not.
[1602.84 --> 1604.84]  This is a house of worship.
[1604.84 --> 1608.84]  The church is seated in the house of worship.
[1608.84 --> 1613.84]  And when we are done this morning, the church will exit the doors and leave.
[1613.84 --> 1624.84]  The church is the men, women, and children in this world whom God, by the Holy Spirit, makes alive and causes them to believe the gospel when they hear it.
[1624.84 --> 1631.84]  And in believing it, to cling to it and to walk with him who gave it to them.
[1631.84 --> 1636.84]  And God is building the church to be his spiritual dwelling place.
[1636.84 --> 1645.84]  And to be honest, it is a weird and wonderful thing that God dwells among us, his people.
[1645.84 --> 1646.84]  Right?
[1646.84 --> 1650.84]  Where believers exist, that is where God lives.
[1650.84 --> 1653.84]  That's where he can be seen.
[1653.84 --> 1654.84]  Right?
[1654.84 --> 1657.84]  That's where his testimony among his people is heard.
[1657.84 --> 1661.84]  And that is where the character of God is fleshed out.
[1661.84 --> 1662.84]  It is embodied.
[1662.84 --> 1676.84]  We embody the living God in our life as believers, as we live, as we walk, and speak, and carry out our lives through the Holy Spirit,
[1676.84 --> 1681.84]  and dwelling us, and sanctifying us, and empowering us.
[1681.84 --> 1689.84]  And so in our passage this morning, Paul gives us two pictures that describe the church as God's spiritual dwelling.
[1689.84 --> 1695.84]  The first picture is the picture of a family, because we have this word in our passage, household.
[1695.84 --> 1701.84]  And then the second picture is the picture of a people rising up to be this holy temple.
[1701.84 --> 1709.84]  And it's a temple that is rising up, it's building, so it's alive, it's moving, it's growing, it's vibrant.
[1709.84 --> 1713.84]  And these are two metaphors of the church that Paul gives us.
[1713.84 --> 1717.84]  The church as a household, and the church as a temple.
[1719.84 --> 1726.84]  So one question I had as I was looking at this passage is, why is Paul mixing his metaphors?
[1726.84 --> 1735.84]  Because in Greek it's all one sentence, and he's talking about this household that then is being built up and rising as a temple.
[1735.84 --> 1740.84]  So what does a household and a temple have in common?
[1740.84 --> 1745.84]  And what I discovered this week from a commentary I read is that actually in the Greek,
[1745.84 --> 1750.84]  the word for household and the word for temple share the same root word.
[1750.84 --> 1753.84]  It's part of the same family of word.
[1753.84 --> 1756.84]  These two words are closely related.
[1756.84 --> 1767.84]  And there's another place in the scriptures where these two metaphors of a building and a family are intentionally combined to give us a fuller picture.
[1767.84 --> 1774.84]  So in 2 Samuel chapter 7, David wants to build God a temple.
[1774.84 --> 1778.84]  Do you remember that story? David wants to build God a temple.
[1778.84 --> 1792.84]  David decides that it is actually a disgrace that he, the king, should live in this nice palace made of cedar while God dwells in a tent, the tabernacle.
[1792.84 --> 1795.84]  So David decides, I want to build a house for God.
[1795.84 --> 1798.84]  Here's how, here's what God says.
[1798.84 --> 1800.84]  We'll read some of it here.
[1800.84 --> 1805.84]  God says to David, are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
[1805.84 --> 1811.84]  I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day.
[1811.84 --> 1816.84]  I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
[1816.84 --> 1821.84]  So God says, no, David, you're not going to build me a house.
[1821.84 --> 1827.84]  But then God says this in a couple of verses later in verses 11 to 14.
[1827.84 --> 1835.84]  It says this, the Lord declares to you, David, that the Lord himself will establish a house for you.
[1835.84 --> 1848.84]  When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and I will establish his kingdom.
[1848.84 --> 1856.84]  He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
[1856.84 --> 1861.84]  I will be his father, he will be my son.
[1861.84 --> 1866.84]  So God says to David, I will build you a house.
[1866.84 --> 1868.84]  But what kind of house is God talking about?
[1868.84 --> 1871.84]  He's not talking about a physical house.
[1871.84 --> 1873.84]  He's talking about a household.
[1873.84 --> 1876.84]  He's talking about a royal dynasty.
[1876.84 --> 1879.84]  So Solomon, David's son, will build the temple.
[1879.84 --> 1885.84]  But God says, before you, David, build me a house, I am going to build you a house.
[1885.84 --> 1894.84]  And so you can see the two meanings, a temple that God is going to build, and a household there together.
[1894.84 --> 1905.84]  And as we continue to read in the scriptures, we find out that actually the temple, the physical temple that Solomon built, was itself a symbol of the real temple, Jesus Christ.
[1905.84 --> 1908.84]  Jesus is the real temple.
[1908.84 --> 1918.84]  And so in John chapter 1, 14, John tells us the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[1918.84 --> 1923.84]  And that word dwelling, as probably you've heard before, is the word tabernacle.
[1923.84 --> 1927.84]  The eternal word of God tabernacled among us.
[1927.84 --> 1931.84]  Jesus Christ became the place where God dwells with his people.
[1931.84 --> 1938.84]  So when you see Jesus Christ, think the temple, the temple, this is God dwelling with his people.
[1938.84 --> 1942.84]  He has the glory of God dwelling within him.
[1942.84 --> 1947.84]  He is our great high priest who makes the full propitiation for our sins.
[1947.84 --> 1950.84]  And he is what?
[1950.84 --> 1953.84]  He is the son of David.
[1953.84 --> 1957.84]  So you see how the two meanings come back together.
[1957.84 --> 1966.84]  Jesus Christ, who is the temple, is the offspring of David, the house that God promised in 2 Samuel that he would build for David.
[1966.84 --> 1967.84]  Cool, right?
[1967.84 --> 1969.84]  I don't know if you're getting this.
[1969.84 --> 1973.84]  So we have the temple and we have the household of God.
[1973.84 --> 1976.84]  Two pictures both united in Christ Jesus.
[1976.84 --> 1978.84]  The true temple, the true son of David.
[1978.84 --> 1983.84]  The house, hold the temple of God.
[1983.84 --> 1989.84]  And now, here's the important point, now the same is true of the church.
[1989.84 --> 2001.84]  Paul says, you are now members of God's household, joined together to become a holy temple in the Lord, built together to become God's dwelling place.
[2001.84 --> 2002.84]  Right?
[2002.84 --> 2004.84]  The church is now the temple.
[2004.84 --> 2007.84]  The church is now where God dwells among his people.
[2007.84 --> 2012.84]  And the church now is the household of God.
[2012.84 --> 2020.84]  So let's reflect upon the ways that we both are the household of God and the temple of God.
[2020.84 --> 2025.84]  That's what Paul is talking about and teaching us about the church in this passage.
[2025.84 --> 2028.84]  So the first picture is the picture of a family.
[2028.84 --> 2029.84]  The household of God.
[2029.84 --> 2034.84]  So look here at what it says in verse 19, our passage this morning.
[2034.84 --> 2039.84]  He says, consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, especially talking to the Gentiles.
[2039.84 --> 2043.84]  Remember, God had torn down that dividing wall of hostility.
[2043.84 --> 2051.84]  The Gentiles who were formerly strangers to God, alienated from the promises of Israel, have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
[2051.84 --> 2056.84]  So Paul says, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens of God's people.
[2056.84 --> 2060.84]  And you have been made members of his household.
[2060.84 --> 2071.84]  Now, in the ancient world, the word household meant family like we often think of it, but also meant a lineage.
[2071.84 --> 2077.84]  It meant a dynasty, kind of like a tribe, like we saw in 2 Samuel.
[2077.84 --> 2082.84]  So for instance, in the book of Genesis, Abraham is said to have a household.
[2082.84 --> 2090.84]  And the house of Abraham includes his wife, his children, his grandchildren, but also his servants.
[2090.84 --> 2093.84]  Also, all of the soldiers that fight with him.
[2093.84 --> 2095.84]  This is Abraham's household.
[2095.84 --> 2110.84]  When Joseph invites his father, Jacob, to move to the land of Goshen in Egypt, it says the members of Jacob's family, which went to Egypt, were 70 in all.
[2110.84 --> 2111.84]  Seventy people.
[2111.84 --> 2114.84]  Okay, this is a big household.
[2114.84 --> 2119.84]  In the book of Acts, there are a few occasions where there are household baptisms.
[2119.84 --> 2126.84]  And this means that not only is the individual baptized, but anyone who is part of the household is also baptized.
[2126.84 --> 2131.84]  So the parents, the kids, the relatives, and servants.
[2131.84 --> 2136.84]  And you hear this idea of household in ancient history.
[2136.84 --> 2138.84]  So you might think the house of Caesar, right?
[2138.84 --> 2144.84]  Everyone who is a member of Caesar's household has a status because of that.
[2144.84 --> 2148.84]  So if you're walking around ancient Rome and you are a member of Caesar's household, you are untouchable.
[2148.84 --> 2150.84]  Okay, you have this status.
[2150.84 --> 2152.84]  They're part of the household.
[2152.84 --> 2158.84]  You know, and I thought of the feuding families of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
[2158.84 --> 2164.84]  There's the house of Capulet and the house of Montague.
[2164.84 --> 2170.84]  Maybe you'll notice just last year, a new movie came out called the house of Gucci.
[2170.84 --> 2172.84]  I don't know if you pay attention to this kind of thing.
[2172.84 --> 2173.84]  The house of Gucci, right?
[2173.84 --> 2175.84]  So we have this idea, this house.
[2175.84 --> 2177.84]  You might think of your own families, right?
[2177.84 --> 2179.84]  The household of Banstra.
[2179.84 --> 2182.84]  The household of Cron or of Hamming.
[2182.84 --> 2188.84]  And maybe you even have a coat of arms or a tartan to signify your lineage.
[2188.84 --> 2193.84]  And so this word here, household, has this connotation.
[2193.84 --> 2197.84]  And Paul's saying God is taking both Jews and Gentiles.
[2197.84 --> 2206.84]  He's bringing them together, people from all kinds of different races, tongues, nations, tribes, bringing them together as his household.
[2206.84 --> 2209.84]  The household of God.
[2209.84 --> 2210.84]  The house of Yahweh.
[2210.84 --> 2216.84]  And so if you are a believer, if you trust in Christ for your salvation, you are a child of God.
[2216.84 --> 2218.84]  You are a member of his family.
[2218.84 --> 2221.84]  You are his household.
[2221.84 --> 2225.84]  Galatians chapter 3 verse 26.
[2225.84 --> 2232.84]  So in Christ Jesus, you are all children of God through faith.
[2232.84 --> 2238.84]  You know, and if we are his children, this means that God loves us.
[2238.84 --> 2239.84]  Right?
[2239.84 --> 2240.84]  Right?
[2240.84 --> 2246.84]  God said of his son Jesus, this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.
[2246.84 --> 2252.84]  And when we are united to Christ by faith, this becomes true of us.
[2252.84 --> 2254.84]  God loves you.
[2254.84 --> 2256.84]  God is pleased with you.
[2256.84 --> 2263.84]  Even when you are at your worst, God is crazy about you because you are his child.
[2263.84 --> 2266.84]  God loves you and he is a precious child.
[2266.84 --> 2271.84]  As children of God, we are given the Spirit of God.
[2271.84 --> 2273.84]  You now have his life.
[2273.84 --> 2276.84]  You even start to look a little bit like him.
[2276.84 --> 2282.84]  And it's just like how your own kids look like you.
[2282.84 --> 2286.84]  And I find this to be a profound mystery.
[2286.84 --> 2291.84]  How our kids are just like us on a smaller scale.
[2292.56 --> 2298.68]  Sometimes I look at my own kids and I think, wow, you know, my son or daughter really looks like
[2298.68 --> 2304.52]  Christy. Sometimes I'll think, wow, they really look like me. And it kind of changes as they grow
[2304.52 --> 2310.86]  older. But more than just looking like us, they also have a lot of our personality traits.
[2311.50 --> 2317.68]  They have our same interests. They also have a lot of our same sins. And when they sin,
[2317.68 --> 2323.38]  it's like a mirror. It shows a lot of the things that I do or the things that I say.
[2325.36 --> 2329.78]  Children really are a mirror of their parents. You know, of course, they are their own people.
[2330.18 --> 2334.16]  But I think all of us would admit that when we look at our children, we see a lot of ourselves
[2334.16 --> 2341.80]  in them physically, but also spiritually. This can be a great blessing. It can also be extremely
[2341.80 --> 2351.38]  scary. But the good news is that when we become children of God, we get his spirit. Right? His
[2351.38 --> 2358.48]  Holy Spirit comes into us and begins to change us. He changes our hearts. He changes our desires,
[2358.98 --> 2364.78]  our thoughts, so that we begin to walk like him and talk like him and to reflect his love
[2364.78 --> 2372.32]  as a light into the world. Here's how Paul puts it in 1 Timothy 3, verse 15. He says,
[2372.66 --> 2380.62]  you know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living
[2380.62 --> 2387.74]  God. So as a church, we literally are the household of God. We are his family. We are his children,
[2388.30 --> 2394.32]  indwelled by his spirit, growing up to look like our father. So that's the household image that Paul
[2394.32 --> 2402.20]  talks about. The second picture is the picture of the temple. The house of God is the temple of God.
[2403.04 --> 2411.76]  So look at what Paul says, moving through here in verse 21 in our passage. It says, in him,
[2412.48 --> 2419.14]  that's Christ, the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[2419.14 --> 2428.30]  Now think about what temples are. If you grew up in, well, any place outside of Richmond,
[2428.62 --> 2434.66]  you might not really know what a temple is or be very familiar with it. If you live in Richmond,
[2434.88 --> 2438.64]  we could go on number five road and you see all kinds of temples. Now, Steveson Highway,
[2438.76 --> 2442.60]  we drove by a big Buddhist temple on our way here. So actually, living here in Vancouver,
[2442.60 --> 2449.66]  we kind of have an idea of what temples are like. But what they are is they are physical locations
[2449.66 --> 2458.04]  where a God lives. It's essentially what a temple is. So I'll show you this photo in ancient Ephesus,
[2458.52 --> 2465.72]  where Paul lived and wrote this letter. There was one of the most famous temples in the world.
[2465.72 --> 2472.16]  It was the temple of Artemis. This was, at the time, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
[2473.04 --> 2479.28]  It was built on a platform measuring more than 100,000 square feet, twice the size of a football
[2479.28 --> 2486.56]  field, with 100 stone columns, all made from marble, each 55 feet high.
[2486.56 --> 2497.60]  This was a magnificent temple. People living in the Roman Empire of the first century knew all about
[2497.60 --> 2502.72]  temples. Everywhere you traveled, not only in Ephesus, there's had this world-famous temple,
[2503.32 --> 2513.70]  everywhere had temples. And in the Old Testament, God indeed had a temple. And when Solomon,
[2513.70 --> 2518.86]  remember David's son Solomon, built the temple and he consecrated the temple, do you know what happened?
[2519.58 --> 2526.72]  Fire from heaven came down and filled the temple. The very same fire that was in the cloud leading
[2526.72 --> 2534.32]  Israel through the wilderness. God's own glory filled the temple, right? The temple became the place
[2534.32 --> 2541.02]  where God filled it and dwelt with his people. But now in the New Testament, we know that it was
[2541.02 --> 2547.00]  fulfilled ultimately in Jesus Christ. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. And when we are
[2547.00 --> 2552.78]  united to Christ through faith, this also is true of us. We become the dwelling place of God.
[2554.14 --> 2561.22]  And it's easy to see, right, how God dwelt in Christ, of course. The glory of God in John 1
[2561.22 --> 2571.40]  was full in Christ. But now the question is, if we are the new temple, Christ lived, died, rose again,
[2571.50 --> 2577.98]  ascended into heaven, we now are the temple of God. We are the place on earth where God dwells.
[2578.94 --> 2587.16]  How does God dwell in us? Can you think of a way that it might make sense that God is said to dwell
[2587.16 --> 2597.52]  in us? Well, what happened at Pentecost? The fire from heaven came down once more onto the people there
[2597.52 --> 2603.14]  and they were filled with the Holy Spirit, right? And Jesus said, when he leaves, I will send another
[2603.14 --> 2609.34]  helper, the counselor who will lead you into all truth. He sent the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit
[2609.34 --> 2617.14]  is God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity. And so by the power of the Spirit,
[2617.14 --> 2625.22]  God himself dwells in his people, the church, making them the temple. And so that's what Paul says here
[2625.22 --> 2634.70]  in verse 22. It says, and in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives
[2634.70 --> 2642.92]  by his Spirit. Okay, the same Spirit of God who lived in the tabernacle, who then filled the temple
[2642.92 --> 2650.52]  when it was consecrated, who was in Christ Jesus, and who Christ now poured out upon the church.
[2650.92 --> 2660.22]  The church is the temple of God. And in Galatians 4, 6, Paul says this, because you are his sons,
[2660.34 --> 2667.08]  God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit of him who calls out, Abba, Father.
[2667.08 --> 2676.92]  The Holy Spirit sent to believers, filling their hearts. So if the Spirit of God is in our hearts,
[2677.48 --> 2688.16]  then God is in our hearts. This is a mystery. God is spiritual and infinite, so he can do this. He can
[2688.16 --> 2696.30]  be in all places, and he can be in certain places. By the power of his Spirit, though, he dwells in his
[2696.30 --> 2705.94]  people, the church, making us the temple, the place where God exists on earth. And if we are a temple,
[2706.32 --> 2711.12]  what else does that mean? Paul talks about this. It means that we have a foundation.
[2711.12 --> 2719.56]  So look what it says here in verse 20. It says, built, this temple, built on the foundation of the
[2719.56 --> 2727.46]  apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him, the whole building
[2727.46 --> 2735.20]  is joined together. Okay, so he's talking about a cornerstone, foundation stones, and all of these
[2735.20 --> 2740.72]  other stones being raised up to become this building. All kinds of stones he's talking about here.
[2741.48 --> 2748.60]  So let's look at them for a moment. So it says, Jesus Christ himself is the chief cornerstone. Now, I'm not a
[2748.60 --> 2754.88]  builder. I know some of you in this congregation are builders. I'm not a stonemason. But I do know that in the
[2754.88 --> 2764.00]  ancient world, the first block put in the ground was the cornerstone, and it had to be totally perfect.
[2764.00 --> 2772.56]  The angles, every angle had to be perfect. It had to be just in the right exact place because every other
[2772.56 --> 2781.58]  stone is lined up according to that cornerstone. And any error in that cornerstone would compromise the
[2781.58 --> 2788.64]  entire structure of the building. It may falter or fall. The whole point Paul is making here is he's saying,
[2788.64 --> 2799.36]  Christ is the cornerstone. Christ alone is strong enough. Christ alone is true enough. Christ alone
[2799.36 --> 2806.58]  is just enough to be the cornerstone of the church. And that means that everything that we are about as a
[2806.58 --> 2813.24]  church is founded on Jesus. It is measured by Jesus. It is aligned with Jesus. It is built upon Jesus. And if
[2813.24 --> 2819.66]  we are building anything else as a church that's not built on Jesus, we're totally off base.
[2819.66 --> 2826.92]  If we don't get Jesus right, we're not going to get the church right. If we don't get Jesus right,
[2826.98 --> 2833.58]  how are we even going to know how we are supposed to be as the church? Friends, we have to get Jesus
[2833.58 --> 2839.00]  right. Jesus is the cornerstone. And without the cornerstone, you can't build a foundation. The
[2839.00 --> 2845.06]  foundation, Paul tells us, is the apostles and prophets. That's the word of God, the scriptures.
[2845.06 --> 2852.58]  And so God builds the church and raises up the church on the foundation of God's word, which
[2852.58 --> 2859.46]  testifies to the truthfulness of that cornerstone, Jesus Christ, in the gospel. And this is the way
[2859.46 --> 2866.04]  God works. He sent Jesus and the apostles and prophets to tell us about him, and he builds the church
[2866.04 --> 2872.20]  as all of these other stones, all those, what is the church? It's those who confess Christ Jesus as
[2872.20 --> 2879.36]  Lord, who know that he is their savior. And without him, that they wouldn't even be part of the church.
[2881.12 --> 2886.72]  So this is the way God works. He's building his church, his household, into a holy temple, each of us
[2886.72 --> 2894.18]  individually, and especially when we are together. We are truly the dwelling place of God in Christ Jesus
[2894.18 --> 2904.88]  by his spirit. What a great God we have, right? Friends, do you know this cornerstone? Right? Do you
[2904.88 --> 2913.14]  know Jesus Christ? The invitation of this passage to you and to me is to hop up onto that cornerstone.
[2913.60 --> 2917.52]  And when you do that, and you stand upon this cornerstone, and you check it out, and you say,
[2917.52 --> 2928.28]  this stone is solid. This stone is not going to go anywhere. I think I am going to build my life
[2928.28 --> 2937.34]  on this cornerstone. I want to conclude with a reading from C.S. Lewis. I think it captures
[2937.34 --> 2945.54]  well the message of this passage, Ephesians 2, 19 to 22. Now, Lewis is talking about the individual
[2945.54 --> 2950.50]  Christian in his book, Mere Christianity, but I want us to think, because Paul's talking about this,
[2950.84 --> 2956.26]  the church together. Think about the church, the household of God. So when I read this, think about
[2956.26 --> 2963.02]  not just you, also you individually, but also the household of God. So here's what he says.
[2964.40 --> 2972.84]  He says, imagine yourself, so imagine the church, as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house.
[2972.84 --> 2979.92]  At first, perhaps, you can understand what he is doing. He is getting the drains right, and stopping
[2979.92 --> 2986.56]  the leaks in the roof, and so on. You knew that those jobs needed doing, and so you're not surprised.
[2987.58 --> 2992.16]  But presently, he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably,
[2992.70 --> 3000.12]  and does not seem to make any sense. What on earth is he up to? The explanation is that he is building
[3000.12 --> 3007.42]  quite a different house from the one you thought of, throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra
[3007.42 --> 3013.94]  floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were being made into a decent little
[3013.94 --> 3023.88]  cottage, but he is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it himself. Let's pray.
[3023.88 --> 3041.18]  Father, we praise you for what you are doing in this world. Father, we thank you for Ephesians, which tells us
[3041.18 --> 3049.06]  when we think about what is our God doing in this world, that the answer is God is building his church.
[3049.06 --> 3057.82]  He is building it from living stones, as first Peter tells us, from all over the world, and he is
[3057.82 --> 3064.98]  fashioning us together to become this living temple in which he dwells by his spirit, making us the
[3064.98 --> 3074.36]  household of God, a lineage, a dynasty of his kingdom. But it's not an exclusive kingdom, Lord. We invite all
[3074.36 --> 3082.76]  of those who would find their lives also on the word of God and on the cornerstone Jesus Christ.
[3084.32 --> 3090.80]  Lord, help us to expand our imaginations, to know this identity that we have. And Lord, help us to live
[3090.80 --> 3097.66]  it out, to live out our identity as your children, whom you love and with whom you are well-pleased,
[3097.66 --> 3104.84]  and to be the temple, the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, that we would know how to conduct
[3104.84 --> 3112.20]  ourselves as the holy temple, because we are being made in your likeness, the likeness of our Heavenly
[3112.20 --> 3119.90]  Father. Lord, we pray for your help by your Holy Spirit, and we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3122.40 --> 3125.70]  All right, please rise and let's sing our song of response together.
[3127.66 --> 3129.72]  Amen.
[3130.12 --> 3130.76]  Amen.
[3134.24 --> 3134.46]  Amen.
[3134.94 --> 3135.52]  Amen.
[3135.52 --> 3135.90]  Amen.
[3135.90 --> 3137.78]  Amen.
[3137.80 --> 3138.34]  Amen.
[3138.46 --> 3138.70]  Amen.
[3138.70 --> 3165.78]  We are people of our journey.
[3165.78 --> 3177.62]  We are people of our journey.
[3177.62 --> 3184.48]  In the shadow of the cross.
[3184.48 --> 3190.64]  God commands the face of Jesus.
[3190.64 --> 3196.72]  Who protects our faithful God.
[3197.16 --> 3202.88]  He who checks the world of service.
[3203.36 --> 3208.64]  Christ the Lord unnestified.
[3208.64 --> 3220.64]  We are people of our journey.
[3220.64 --> 3227.22]  Taking off the cross of Christ.
[3227.66 --> 3232.48]  We are people of our journey.
[3233.68 --> 3238.64]  Loading up from death to life.
[3238.64 --> 3244.64]  We release the house that we know.
[3245.32 --> 3250.64]  We relinquish all of them.
[3250.64 --> 3256.64]  We receive just a free saver.
[3256.64 --> 3262.64]  We are people of our journey.
[3262.64 --> 3274.64]  We are people of our journey.
[3274.64 --> 3280.64]  Rising up in life every home.
[3280.64 --> 3287.64]  We are people of our journey.
[3287.64 --> 3292.64]  Speaking peace and peace.
[3292.64 --> 3296.64]  We are people of our journey.
[3296.64 --> 3298.64] 합니다.
[3298.64 --> 3299.64]  And one...
[3299.64 --> 3302.64]  Our journey will be wonderful.
[3302.64 --> 3319.48]  We are the Lord, to the kingdom, the wind will be, to the light of God's overjoyed.
[3332.64 --> 3350.48]  So, in response to God's word, who he has made us and what he has done for us, we also respond with the giving of our tithes and offerings as our sacrifice, as priests of the temple.
[3350.48 --> 3373.36]  And so, our designated offering this morning is for the chaplain and refugee support mobilizer. This is something our church and our classes in Northwest and Southeast supports ministry out of First Vancouver, First CRC Vancouver, to support the work of refugee and immigrant ministry.
[3373.78 --> 3378.56]  So, that's our designated offering, and we will ask the deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[3380.48 --> 3410.46]  Thank you.
[3410.48 --> 3412.48]  Thank you.
[3412.48 --> 3414.48]  Thank you.
[3414.48 --> 3416.48]  Amen.
[3444.48 --> 3446.48]  Amen.
[3474.48 --> 3476.48]  Amen.
[3492.48 --> 3498.72]  Our Lord is the God of all creation, and he is our Father.
[3499.80 --> 3503.24]  And as our Father, he listens to us when we call on his name.
[3503.24 --> 3508.02]  He promises to rid the world of the shadows of death.
[3509.24 --> 3511.14]  So in the meantime, we pray.
[3512.00 --> 3516.40]  We name those things that we need him to make new.
[3517.44 --> 3519.12]  So please join me in prayer.
[3519.34 --> 3524.32]  And after each prayer, I will say, Lord, hear our prayer.
[3525.06 --> 3526.64]  And I'll ask you to respond.
[3527.52 --> 3528.98]  You make all things new.
[3529.80 --> 3530.08]  Okay?
[3530.30 --> 3531.14]  So let's do that together.
[3531.14 --> 3533.10]  Let's pray.
[3533.24 --> 3545.24]  God, our Father, the world you created for good is ravaged by greed, consumption, and exploitation.
[3546.88 --> 3551.60]  Disease and hunger and violence threaten to swallow the world in death.
[3551.60 --> 3564.50]  Rise up, O God, and hear the cries of those who suffer, so that your goodness and justice may be done and may be seen and heard in all the earth.
[3564.50 --> 3572.46]  We pray, Lord, for the refugee ministry supported by our classes out of 1st CRC in Vancouver.
[3573.42 --> 3583.50]  Lord, would you help this ministry, Lord, to be your hands and feet in the world, to be a tangible expression of your own love for the refugee.
[3583.50 --> 3584.50]  Lord, you told your church.
[3584.50 --> 3593.34]  Lord, you told your church to care for refugees because we ourselves were without a home.
[3593.68 --> 3594.98]  And we know what it is like.
[3594.98 --> 3599.70]  So, Lord, would you support the refugees.
[3599.82 --> 3602.94]  Lord, we thank you for the refugee families that you have brought to our own congregation.
[3603.58 --> 3606.24]  We ask that you would help us to continue to be a blessing to them.
[3606.64 --> 3610.26]  Help them to be a blessing to us and a part of our church.
[3612.18 --> 3613.88]  Lord, hear our prayer.
[3613.88 --> 3624.50]  Jesus, our Savior, you gave the blind sight and you raised the dead.
[3625.66 --> 3629.60]  We confess that we are weak, but you are strong.
[3630.88 --> 3640.88]  Shepherd your church to confront the brokenness in ourselves and in our world through confidence and trust in you, the restorer of broken things.
[3640.88 --> 3653.10]  Our Heavenly Father, we pray that you would bring comfort to the sick, to the grieving, the dying, the suffering, the frail, and the lonely.
[3654.22 --> 3660.66]  Father, this morning we lift up to you many in our own congregation who need our prayers as we all do.
[3661.62 --> 3669.44]  We pray specifically, Lord, for Pat, whose kidneys are close to having to be replaced through a donor.
[3670.88 --> 3677.56]  We pray for Ted and Ali, our two dear eldest members of our church.
[3678.74 --> 3685.36]  We pray for those who are struggling with various forms of cancer and ongoing treatment and recovery.
[3686.38 --> 3688.74]  Lord, we especially pray for little Richie.
[3689.64 --> 3697.90]  Lord, we pray for your mercy, your tenderness, and your healing hand upon him and all of those who need your healing in their lives.
[3697.90 --> 3707.54]  Father, for those who also suffer chronic pain, for those who are living in care homes where they might feel loneliness,
[3708.30 --> 3709.90]  Father, we lift them all up to you.
[3710.66 --> 3715.52]  But Father, we also praise you for the good things that you give us, Lord.
[3715.56 --> 3721.04]  We thank you for the birth of Abriel Burren to Emmanuel and Sifahue.
[3721.40 --> 3723.48]  Lord, we thank you for a beautiful young girl.
[3723.48 --> 3732.84]  We pray that you would grow her up, raise her up to be blessed in the Lord and to know you as her personal Savior.
[3734.24 --> 3735.58]  Lord, hear our prayer.
[3736.84 --> 3738.50]  You make all things new.
[3739.66 --> 3743.82]  Holy Spirit, in your power, we pray that you would strengthen the bonds of your church
[3743.82 --> 3750.02]  in a time marked by confusion and division within the church
[3750.02 --> 3755.44]  about the foundation of truth that you gave us through your apostles and prophets and Holy Scripture.
[3756.44 --> 3761.02]  Would you give us courage and wisdom to stand upon the only sure foundation there is?
[3762.08 --> 3765.36]  And at the same time, would you animate our love for one another
[3765.36 --> 3773.24]  and stir us to be a radical, stir us up to a radical hope in our identity as your temple and your household?
[3774.84 --> 3779.62]  And Lord, give us a hope for our future together at your heavenly banquet.
[3781.02 --> 3782.38]  Lord, hear our prayer.
[3783.46 --> 3784.88]  You make all things new.
[3785.78 --> 3788.12]  And now gathering our prayers into one,
[3788.80 --> 3792.02]  we're going to pray as Jesus taught us.
[3792.02 --> 3794.94]  The Lord's Prayer, which we'll have up on the screen,
[3796.02 --> 3796.98]  we're saying together,
[3797.86 --> 3799.84]  Our Father, who art in heaven,
[3800.74 --> 3802.32]  hallowed be thy name.
[3802.98 --> 3804.00]  Thy kingdom come.
[3804.72 --> 3805.84]  Thy will be done
[3805.84 --> 3808.44]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[3809.46 --> 3811.68]  Give us this day our daily bread
[3811.68 --> 3813.98]  and forgive us our debts
[3813.98 --> 3816.24]  as we forgive our debtors.
[3816.74 --> 3819.02]  And lead us not into temptation,
[3819.74 --> 3821.26]  but deliver us from evil.
[3821.26 --> 3823.28]  For thine is the kingdom
[3823.28 --> 3824.54]  and the power
[3824.54 --> 3826.46]  and the glory forever.
[3827.34 --> 3827.82]  Amen.
[3830.76 --> 3831.68]  Brothers and sisters,
[3831.82 --> 3833.06]  please rise
[3833.06 --> 3834.20]  and body your spirit
[3834.20 --> 3834.96]  as you are able.
[3835.96 --> 3836.72]  And we go from here
[3836.72 --> 3837.54]  with the Lord's blessing.
[3838.16 --> 3840.74]  As soon as we receive the benediction
[3840.74 --> 3841.96]  and we sing our final song,
[3842.04 --> 3843.54]  we're invited to a time of fellowship
[3843.54 --> 3844.56]  right through the doors
[3844.56 --> 3845.74]  in the fellowship hall
[3845.74 --> 3848.66]  to be the household of God.
[3849.30 --> 3849.98]  Meet one another,
[3850.10 --> 3850.64]  greet one another,
[3850.64 --> 3851.92]  catch up in fellowship.
[3852.66 --> 3854.08]  So I invite you to hold out your hands
[3854.08 --> 3855.68]  as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[3856.20 --> 3859.04]  Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself
[3859.04 --> 3860.88]  and God our Father,
[3861.50 --> 3862.58]  who loved us
[3862.58 --> 3864.50]  and gave us eternal comfort
[3864.50 --> 3866.02]  and good hope through grace,
[3866.82 --> 3867.70]  comfort your hearts
[3867.70 --> 3869.08]  and establish them
[3869.08 --> 3871.74]  in every good work and word.
[3871.74 --> 3872.70]  Amen.
[3872.70 --> 3893.48]  Be thou my vision,
[3893.48 --> 3894.62]  O Lord,
[3894.62 --> 3895.22]  O Lord,
[3895.22 --> 3898.04]  love my heart,
[3898.04 --> 3900.36]  not be all else
[3900.36 --> 3903.34]  to be safe and loud.
[3903.34 --> 3906.74]  Am I best,
[3906.86 --> 3909.06]  love my day,
[3909.06 --> 3911.68]  O my night,
[3911.92 --> 3912.72]  waking,
[3912.72 --> 3914.40]  I sleeping,
[3914.92 --> 3916.50]  and present,
[3916.70 --> 3918.98]  my light.
[3918.98 --> 3923.32]  Be thou my wisdom,
[3923.32 --> 3927.22]  and thou my true world.
[3927.22 --> 3930.62]  I ever will be,
[3930.84 --> 3934.42]  and thou with me, Lord.
[3934.42 --> 3937.42]  Thou my great Father,
[3937.42 --> 3938.98]  Thou my love,
[3938.98 --> 3939.54]  and thou with me,
[3939.54 --> 3943.66]  and thou with me,
[3943.66 --> 3944.82]  tell thee,
[3944.82 --> 3948.48]  that I one will be.
[3948.48 --> 3949.48]  O Lord,
[3949.48 --> 3953.52]  my King of heaven,
[3953.52 --> 3957.66]  my victory won,
[3957.66 --> 3961.38]  may I reach heaven's charge,
[3961.38 --> 3964.78]  O bright heaven's sun,
[3964.78 --> 3967.54]  all of all,
[3967.54 --> 3971.02]  and all ever before.
[3971.02 --> 3975.04]  Still be my vision,
[3975.44 --> 3979.96]  O ruler of all.
[3994.78 --> 3998.10]  Amen.
[4002.12 --> 4003.52]  Amen.
[4003.62 --> 4004.60]  Amen.
[4004.60 --> 4005.36]  Amen.
[4005.36 --> 4005.54]  Amen.
[4005.58 --> 4006.08]  Amen.
[4006.10 --> 4006.36]  Amen.
[4006.36 --> 4011.58]  Amen.
[4020.86 --> 4021.42]  Amen.
[4021.78 --> 4022.26]  Amen.
[4022.26 --> 4023.18]  Amen.
[4023.18 --> 4023.40]  Amen.
