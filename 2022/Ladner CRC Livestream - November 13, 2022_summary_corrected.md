• In Western culture, the idea of spiritual forces of evil is considered primitive, but in many other cultures it's widely accepted
• Christians are in a spiritual battle against evil entities, including demons and Satan
• This battle can be thought of as a wrestling match, where Satan seeks to find vulnerabilities in individuals' souls

• If confident in one's righteousness before God, they are invincible to Satan's accusations
• The gospel of peace is essential for having the right shoes (or protection) on our feet as we live life with God
• The gospel reconciles us to God, giving us peace and a shield against Satan's attempts at division.
• There are two types of shields in the Roman army: small round shields and large oblong shields that cover a soldier's entire body.

• It's a part of our armour that is most dangerous to him
• Satan's goal is to keep people from reading the Bible
• The armour of God in Ephesians is a call to live with God in Jesus Christ and fight against spiritual forces
• Paul warns that we are in a constant wrestling match with Satan, who seeks to exploit our weaknesses
• We must put on this armour and stand in the life of God in Christ to resist evil
