[981.56 --> 989.34]  Thou my great Father, oh may I be
[989.34 --> 997.34]  Thou in thee dwelling, and I run with thee
[997.34 --> 1011.76]  Riches I heed, not of vain and deep praise
[1011.76 --> 1019.76]  Thou my inheritance, now and always
[1019.76 --> 1027.92]  Thou and thou only, first in my heart
[1027.92 --> 1035.76]  My King of heaven, my treasure thou art
[1035.76 --> 1049.76]  High King of heaven, my victory won
[1049.76 --> 1057.62]  May I reach heaven's doors, I'll wear them strong
[1057.62 --> 1065.62]  Part of my own heart, whatever me fall
[1065.62 --> 1074.62]  Still be my vision, O ruler of all
[1074.62 --> 1097.98]  Well today is a great day
[1097.98 --> 1101.58]  Because right now we have the privilege to
[1101.58 --> 1105.16]  Administer the baptism of Ezra Nala Klumps
[1105.16 --> 1107.84]  So maybe I can invite Peter, Kara
[1107.84 --> 1111.38]  And any other kids who want to come up, it's fine
[1111.38 --> 1136.46]  So let me say first a word about baptism
[1136.46 --> 1142.16]  In baptism, God seals the promises that he gave
[1142.16 --> 1145.20]  When he made his covenant with us
[1145.20 --> 1148.90]  Calling us and our children to put our faith
[1148.90 --> 1153.86]  And our trust in Jesus Christ for both our life and our death
[1153.86 --> 1158.70]  So from the beginning, from God's first calling of his people
[1158.70 --> 1163.16]  God graciously included our children in the covenant that he made
[1163.16 --> 1166.10]  In the promises that he made with his people
[1166.10 --> 1167.80]  That he would be for us
[1167.80 --> 1171.00]  That he would be our God and we would be his people
[1171.00 --> 1174.74]  So here's what God says in Genesis chapter 17
[1174.74 --> 1179.40]  He says, I will establish my covenant between me and you
[1179.40 --> 1183.00]  And your offspring after you throughout their generations
[1183.00 --> 1188.10]  For an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after you
[1188.10 --> 1193.56]  And so just as children of the old covenant received the sign of circumcision
[1193.56 --> 1197.62]  Our children also now receive the sign of baptism
[1197.62 --> 1202.40]  And we are therefore to teach our little ones that they have been set apart in baptism
[1202.40 --> 1203.98]  As God's own children
[1203.98 --> 1207.96]  So that they may then grow up to be committed to the Lord
[1207.96 --> 1209.68]  And to grow in faith in him
[1209.68 --> 1213.84]  And so Peter and Kara and older sisters
[1213.84 --> 1218.36]  Having heard God's gracious promises to us in Christ
[1218.36 --> 1222.24]  Do you desire that your child, Ezra and Nala, be baptized today?
[1223.74 --> 1224.34]  Okay
[1224.34 --> 1228.78]  So now I'm going to ask them to make some vows
[1228.78 --> 1230.80]  And then I will ask all of you to make a vow
[1230.80 --> 1233.48]  So first, Peter and Kara
[1233.48 --> 1237.44]  Do you believe that your child, though sinful by nature
[1237.44 --> 1242.04]  Is received by God in Christ as a member of his covenant
[1242.04 --> 1244.34]  And therefore ought to be baptized?
[1246.74 --> 1249.70]  And do you promise a reliance on the Holy Spirit
[1249.70 --> 1251.78]  And with the help of the Christian community
[1251.78 --> 1256.04]  To do all in your power to instruct this child in the Christian faith
[1256.04 --> 1261.04]  And to lead him, by your example, into a life of Christian discipleship
[1261.04 --> 1265.88]  Congregation, may I ask you to please rise
[1265.88 --> 1271.82]  And please make this promise
[1271.82 --> 1274.80]  Do you promise to love, encourage, and support
[1274.80 --> 1276.60]  These brothers and sisters
[1276.60 --> 1279.20]  By teaching the gospel of God's grace
[1279.20 --> 1282.72]  By being an example of Christian faith and character
[1282.72 --> 1286.34]  And by giving the strong support of God's family
[1286.34 --> 1289.54]  In fellowship, prayer, and service
[1289.54 --> 1291.24]  Thank you
[1291.24 --> 1294.86]  You may be seated
[1294.86 --> 1299.42]  Okay, Ezra
[1299.42 --> 1301.64]  I'm coming over
[1301.64 --> 1309.08]  Ezra
[1309.08 --> 1309.68]  Ezra
[1309.68 --> 1312.72]  It is for you that Jesus came into this world
[1312.72 --> 1314.98]  It is for you that he lived
[1314.98 --> 1317.88]  It is for you that he suffered on this cross and died
[1317.88 --> 1321.68]  It is for you that he then rose again from the dead
[1321.68 --> 1324.72]  And he did all this for you, little one
[1324.72 --> 1327.26]  Though you know nothing of it yet
[1327.26 --> 1329.74]  And it shows us that truly
[1329.74 --> 1332.88]  God loved us first
[1332.88 --> 1335.80]  And that we love because of his love for us
[1335.80 --> 1338.52]  So Ezra
[1338.52 --> 1341.30]  See this
[1341.30 --> 1343.98]  I baptize you
[1343.98 --> 1346.24]  In the name of the Father
[1346.24 --> 1347.54]  And of the Son
[1347.54 --> 1349.30]  And of the Holy Spirit
[1349.30 --> 1350.08]  Amen
[1350.08 --> 1357.64]  And though your parents
[1357.64 --> 1358.94]  And your sisters
[1358.94 --> 1360.70]  And maybe your grandparents
[1360.70 --> 1362.12]  They will call you Ezra
[1362.12 --> 1364.94]  Your deep and true name
[1364.94 --> 1366.12]  Is Christian
[1366.12 --> 1369.06]  May you become and be
[1369.06 --> 1370.42]  Who you are in Christ
[1370.42 --> 1372.18]  And may the Lord bless you
[1372.18 --> 1372.76]  And keep you
[1372.76 --> 1373.54]  And may the Lord
[1373.54 --> 1375.70]  Shine his face upon you
[1375.70 --> 1376.82]  And be gracious to you
[1376.82 --> 1378.08]  And may the Lord
[1378.08 --> 1379.58]  Turn his face toward you
[1379.58 --> 1380.72]  And give you peace
[1380.72 --> 1383.62]  Would you all pray with me?
[1385.26 --> 1386.10]  Holy Spirit
[1386.10 --> 1387.66]  We pray that you would come
[1387.66 --> 1390.08]  And be with us this morning
[1390.08 --> 1391.62]  We thank you Lord
[1391.62 --> 1392.86]  For this sign
[1392.86 --> 1393.56]  And the seal
[1393.56 --> 1395.86]  Of your grace
[1395.86 --> 1397.00]  And your love for us
[1397.00 --> 1398.56]  That even while we were sinners
[1398.56 --> 1399.54]  And we had no ability
[1399.54 --> 1400.70]  To respond to you
[1400.70 --> 1402.50]  Yet you set your promises
[1402.50 --> 1403.74]  Of grace upon us
[1403.74 --> 1405.72]  Lord would you help
[1405.72 --> 1406.36]  These parents
[1406.36 --> 1407.22]  Peter and Kara
[1407.22 --> 1408.30]  And give them everything
[1408.30 --> 1409.76]  They stand in need of
[1409.76 --> 1412.42]  That they may raise Ezra
[1412.42 --> 1413.82]  To know and worship you
[1413.82 --> 1416.06]  Lord would you protect Ezra
[1416.06 --> 1417.98]  Would you work in his heart
[1417.98 --> 1419.08]  By your Holy Spirit
[1419.08 --> 1420.78]  Beginning even now
[1420.78 --> 1421.70]  So that he would know
[1421.70 --> 1422.96]  That you are his God
[1422.96 --> 1425.14]  And Lord also empower
[1425.14 --> 1426.80]  All of us in this congregation
[1426.80 --> 1428.80]  To live out our calling
[1428.80 --> 1430.50]  As the covenant body of Christ
[1430.50 --> 1432.00]  So that you would be glorified
[1432.00 --> 1435.00]  And that Ezra would know you
[1435.00 --> 1436.68]  We pray all these things
[1436.68 --> 1437.50]  In Jesus name
[1437.50 --> 1438.42]  Amen
[1438.42 --> 1441.06]  Now in the name
[1441.06 --> 1442.76]  Of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1442.76 --> 1444.24]  The only king
[1444.24 --> 1445.28]  And head of the church
[1445.28 --> 1447.08]  Ezra is now received
[1447.08 --> 1447.92]  Into the membership
[1447.92 --> 1449.30]  Of the Holy Catholic Church
[1449.30 --> 1451.54]  Engaged to confess Christ
[1451.54 --> 1453.44]  And to be God's faithful servant
[1453.44 --> 1454.94]  Until Christ's end
[1454.94 --> 1457.42]  Ezra
[1457.42 --> 1465.70]  Look at this
[1465.70 --> 1468.34]  Yeah there's
[1468.34 --> 1469.60]  Noah
[1469.60 --> 1471.04]  And lots of animals
[1471.04 --> 1471.28]  Here
[1471.28 --> 1472.38]  You can have that
[1472.38 --> 1473.14]  Okay
[1473.14 --> 1474.88]  And here's your cart
[1474.88 --> 1478.10]  Let's praise the Lord
[1478.10 --> 1488.42]  So let's all stand
[1488.42 --> 1489.12]  And we will sing
[1489.12 --> 1490.50]  A song response together
[1495.70 --> 1511.86]  We are a moment
[1511.86 --> 1515.10]  You are forever
[1515.10 --> 1518.92]  Lord of the ages
[1518.92 --> 1522.82]  God before time
[1522.82 --> 1525.86]  We are a vapor
[1525.86 --> 1529.48]  You are eternal
[1529.48 --> 1533.06]  Love everlasting
[1533.06 --> 1538.90]  Reigning on high
[1538.90 --> 1542.58]  Holy, holy
[1542.58 --> 1545.48]  Lord God almighty
[1545.48 --> 1550.78]  Worthy is the Lamb
[1550.78 --> 1553.34]  Who was slain
[1553.34 --> 1557.02]  Highest praises
[1557.02 --> 1560.12]  Honor and glory
[1560.12 --> 1566.78]  Be unto your name
[1566.78 --> 1573.78]  Be unto your name
[1573.78 --> 1578.22]  We are the broken
[1578.22 --> 1578.24]  You are the broken
[1578.24 --> 1582.44]  You are the healer
[1582.44 --> 1585.74]  Jesus redeemer
[1585.74 --> 1589.94]  Mighty to save
[1589.94 --> 1593.58]  You are the love song
[1593.58 --> 1596.62]  We'll sing forever
[1596.62 --> 1600.78]  Bowing before you
[1600.78 --> 1603.86]  Blessed in your name
[1603.86 --> 1606.10]  Blessed in your name
[1606.10 --> 1610.04]  Holy, holy
[1610.04 --> 1612.96]  Lord God almighty
[1612.96 --> 1618.54]  Worthy is the Lamb
[1618.54 --> 1620.54]  Who was slain
[1620.54 --> 1621.30]  Who was slain
[1621.30 --> 1624.86]  Highest praises
[1624.86 --> 1626.20]  Believe in your grace
[1626.20 --> 1627.46]  Lord ever said
[1627.60 --> 1629.98]  Felic in your name
[1629.98 --> 1630.68]  enorme
[1630.68 --> 1631.14]  God is the Lamb
[1631.14 --> 1635.34]  your name
[1635.34 --> 1638.58]  be unto
[1638.58 --> 1642.76]  your name
[1642.76 --> 1647.26]  holy holy
[1647.26 --> 1650.26]  Lord God almighty
[1650.26 --> 1654.64]  worthy is
[1654.64 --> 1657.10]  the lamb who was
[1657.10 --> 1658.58]  slain
[1658.58 --> 1662.28]  highest praises
[1662.28 --> 1665.36]  honor and glory
[1665.36 --> 1668.58]  be unto
[1668.58 --> 1672.58]  your name
[1672.58 --> 1675.96]  be unto
[1675.96 --> 1680.32]  your name
[1680.32 --> 1688.08]  the children are dismissed
[1688.08 --> 1690.54]  for some children's worship
[1690.54 --> 1707.00]  we come now to a time of confession
[1707.00 --> 1719.58]  we come now to a time of confession
[1719.58 --> 1723.06]  and the confession this morning
[1723.06 --> 1724.88]  comes from words of
[1724.88 --> 1727.04]  Isaiah 1 and Isaiah 2
[1727.04 --> 1730.18]  so
[1730.18 --> 1732.70]  let me start
[1732.70 --> 1734.90]  and you join as indicated
[1734.90 --> 1738.72]  Lord we acknowledge
[1738.72 --> 1740.60]  that you have been with us
[1740.60 --> 1741.66]  from the beginning
[1741.66 --> 1744.32]  that we belong to you
[1744.32 --> 1745.28]  and yet
[1745.28 --> 1748.16]  we have rebelled against you
[1748.16 --> 1752.24]  the ox knows its master
[1752.24 --> 1753.68]  a donkey
[1753.68 --> 1754.70]  place
[1754.70 --> 1756.78]  but we have acted
[1756.78 --> 1758.98]  as if we did not know you
[1758.98 --> 1760.62]  as a people
[1760.62 --> 1762.46]  who do not understand
[1762.46 --> 1765.74]  we have forsaken you
[1765.74 --> 1767.50]  and spurned your commands
[1767.50 --> 1769.44]  and turned our backs on you
[1769.44 --> 1773.68]  Lord have mercy on us
[1773.68 --> 1775.50]  and restore us
[1775.50 --> 1776.64]  to your presence
[1776.64 --> 1781.30]  now hear these words of comfort
[1781.30 --> 1784.14]  come now
[1784.14 --> 1785.42]  let us reason together
[1785.42 --> 1786.52]  says our God
[1786.52 --> 1788.60]  though your sins
[1788.60 --> 1789.72]  are like scarlet
[1789.72 --> 1791.20]  they shall be white
[1791.20 --> 1791.82]  as snow
[1791.82 --> 1793.92]  though they are red
[1793.92 --> 1794.72]  as crimson
[1794.72 --> 1796.08]  they shall be
[1796.08 --> 1796.84]  like wool
[1796.84 --> 1799.06]  and together
[1799.06 --> 1800.16]  come
[1800.16 --> 1801.80]  O people of God
[1801.80 --> 1803.58]  let us walk
[1803.58 --> 1804.52]  in the light
[1804.52 --> 1805.38]  of the Lord
[1805.38 --> 1827.08]  O demon
[1827.08 --> 1829.28]  father's love
[1829.28 --> 1831.50]  for us
[1831.50 --> 1833.50]  how fast
[1833.50 --> 1836.66]  beyond all measure
[1836.66 --> 1839.80]  that he
[1839.80 --> 1841.06]  should give
[1841.06 --> 1844.24]  his only son
[1844.24 --> 1846.56]  to make
[1846.56 --> 1847.50]  the wretch
[1847.50 --> 1849.66]  his treasure
[1849.66 --> 1852.98]  a grave
[1852.98 --> 1853.94]  that paid
[1853.94 --> 1855.50]  not searing
[1855.50 --> 1857.32]  lost
[1857.32 --> 1859.60]  the father
[1859.60 --> 1860.44]  that turns
[1860.44 --> 1862.04]  his face
[1862.04 --> 1863.60]  away
[1863.60 --> 1864.96]  as
[1864.96 --> 1865.88]  moves
[1865.88 --> 1866.24]  bridge
[1866.24 --> 1868.16]  by the chosen
[1868.16 --> 1870.00]  one
[1870.00 --> 1872.44]  bring many
[1872.44 --> 1873.12]  sons
[1873.12 --> 1875.40]  to glory
[1875.40 --> 1880.60]  behold
[1880.60 --> 1882.46]  the men
[1882.46 --> 1883.60]  upon
[1883.60 --> 1885.86]  their cross
[1885.86 --> 1887.72]  my sin
[1887.72 --> 1888.72]  upon
[1888.72 --> 1890.72]  his shoulders
[1890.72 --> 1892.72]  ashamed
[1892.72 --> 1894.72]  I hear
[1894.72 --> 1896.72]  my mocking
[1896.72 --> 1897.72]  voice
[1897.72 --> 1899.72]  called
[1899.72 --> 1900.72]  up
[1900.72 --> 1901.72]  among
[1901.72 --> 1903.72]  their scoffers
[1903.72 --> 1905.72]  it was
[1905.72 --> 1906.72]  my sin
[1906.72 --> 1908.72]  that held
[1908.72 --> 1909.72]  in there
[1909.72 --> 1910.72]  until
[1910.72 --> 1911.72]  it was
[1911.72 --> 1912.72]  accomplished
[1912.72 --> 1919.72]  his dying
[1919.72 --> 1920.72]  breath
[1920.72 --> 1921.72]  has brought
[1921.72 --> 1923.72]  me life
[1923.72 --> 1925.72]  I know
[1925.72 --> 1926.72]  that it
[1926.72 --> 1927.72]  is
[1927.72 --> 1928.72]  finished
[1928.72 --> 1929.72]  I
[1929.72 --> 1931.72]  will not
[1931.72 --> 1932.72]  boast
[1932.72 --> 1933.72]  in anything
[1933.72 --> 1935.72]  no gifts
[1935.72 --> 1936.72]  no power
[1936.72 --> 1940.72]  no wisdom
[1940.72 --> 1941.72]  no gifts
[1941.72 --> 1942.72]  no power
[1942.72 --> 1944.72]  no wisdom
[1944.72 --> 1946.72]  but I
[1946.72 --> 1948.72]  will boast
[1948.72 --> 1949.72]  in Jesus
[1949.72 --> 1950.72]  God
[1950.72 --> 1951.72]  his death
[1951.72 --> 1952.72]  and resurrection
[1952.72 --> 1954.72]  his death
[1954.72 --> 1955.72]  and resurrection
[1955.72 --> 1959.72]  why should
[1959.72 --> 1961.72]  I get
[1961.72 --> 1962.72]  it
[1962.72 --> 1963.72]  from his
[1963.72 --> 1964.72]  reward
[1964.72 --> 1965.72]  I
[1965.72 --> 1967.72]  cannot
[1967.72 --> 1968.72]  give
[1968.72 --> 1969.72]  an answer
[1969.72 --> 1973.72]  but this
[1973.72 --> 1974.72]  I know
[1974.72 --> 1975.72]  with all
[1975.72 --> 1976.72]  my heart
[1976.72 --> 1978.72]  his wounds
[1978.72 --> 1979.72]  have
[1979.72 --> 1980.72]  gained
[1980.72 --> 1981.72]  my ransom
[1981.72 --> 1983.72]  and
[1983.72 --> 1984.72]  gain
[1984.72 --> 1985.72]  my ransom
[1985.72 --> 2002.72]  in
[2003.72 --> 2004.72]  love
[2006.20 --> 2006.70]  new
[2006.72 --> 2007.14]  new
[2007.14 --> 2007.72]  new
[2007.72 --> 2008.34]  new
[2008.34 --> 2010.72]  new
[2010.72 --> 2012.48]  new
[2012.96 --> 2013.22]  new
[2013.72 --> 2015.50]  new
[2015.50 --> 2025.68]  Luke 23, 39-43.
[2026.58 --> 2030.98]  One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him.
[2031.48 --> 2032.60]  Aren't you the Messiah?
[2033.42 --> 2035.10]  Save yourself and us.
[2035.78 --> 2037.92]  But the other criminal rebuked him.
[2037.92 --> 2043.28]  Don't you fear God, he said, since you are under the same sentence.
[2043.28 --> 2048.44]  We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve.
[2048.92 --> 2051.22]  But this man has done nothing wrong.
[2051.94 --> 2056.94]  Then he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
[2057.72 --> 2063.66]  Jesus answered him, truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.
[2064.36 --> 2066.30]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2066.88 --> 2068.16]  Thanks be to God.
[2073.28 --> 2081.64]  Let's pray together.
[2081.64 --> 2099.30]  Our gracious God, our Heavenly Father, we give you praise this morning because of your amazing, extravagant grace to us.
[2100.06 --> 2103.40]  Your promises that you bestow upon us.
[2103.40 --> 2113.38]  And Lord, we pray that in this time, as we open your word together, that your Holy Spirit would take your word of truth and would illumine our hearts.
[2114.02 --> 2115.18]  Sanctify us completely.
[2116.00 --> 2119.88]  And Lord, help us, instruct us, and strengthen us to follow you.
[2120.40 --> 2121.56]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2121.86 --> 2122.10]  Amen.
[2122.10 --> 2122.20]  Amen.
[2123.56 --> 2127.80]  So friends, we are in the church season of Lent, as was said.
[2128.38 --> 2135.50]  And today we're continuing in our series on the seven last words of Jesus from the cross.
[2136.50 --> 2140.18]  You remember last week we considered Jesus' words where he said,
[2140.60 --> 2143.96]  Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.
[2144.26 --> 2147.20]  And we saw in that statement a word of forgiveness.
[2147.20 --> 2151.64]  And this morning we see something amazing and profound.
[2152.22 --> 2155.44]  We see Jesus offering a word of redemption.
[2156.04 --> 2156.94]  A word of redemption.
[2158.54 --> 2163.50]  You know, and as we go through all of our various seasons of life,
[2165.30 --> 2170.74]  we go into them with different ambitions and different priorities.
[2171.24 --> 2173.78]  And that these things shift along the way.
[2173.78 --> 2181.32]  So in the early stages of life, maybe when we are teens or when we are young adults,
[2182.16 --> 2186.14]  we're in this stage of anticipation and preparation.
[2186.82 --> 2189.38]  We're planning for what we're going to do in the future.
[2189.66 --> 2194.68]  We're dreaming about what our life will look like and what relationships we might have,
[2194.76 --> 2197.84]  what work we might do, where we might live.
[2197.84 --> 2202.96]  And then in the second stage of life, the middle stage,
[2203.52 --> 2208.50]  for some people, it's not the life that we were anticipating and dreaming of, is it?
[2209.92 --> 2216.16]  But in this middle stage, we're living into the life that God has given us.
[2216.30 --> 2219.90]  We're seeking to be faithful with the relationships and the jobs
[2219.90 --> 2224.84]  and everything that God has put us in.
[2225.70 --> 2227.98]  All the demands of the middle.
[2229.66 --> 2232.02]  Well, then comes the third stage.
[2232.56 --> 2233.46]  The third third.
[2234.38 --> 2236.02]  And this is the final season of life.
[2236.12 --> 2240.36]  And it's a season when often our work, or at least our paid employment,
[2240.72 --> 2242.10]  often comes to an end.
[2242.10 --> 2247.08]  Your kids, hopefully, have moved out of the house.
[2247.58 --> 2249.60]  Not always, but that's okay.
[2251.18 --> 2253.96]  And you also, you start to ask different kinds of questions.
[2254.74 --> 2257.16]  You know, on the one hand, you might look back.
[2257.84 --> 2259.70]  And you start asking questions like,
[2259.88 --> 2262.22]  what impact has my life made on the world?
[2263.22 --> 2265.02]  How will I be remembered?
[2265.02 --> 2271.50]  But not only do you look back, you're also looking forward.
[2272.10 --> 2275.74]  You're thinking more about that question that all of us have to face.
[2275.84 --> 2278.96]  The question of, what about death?
[2280.10 --> 2282.12]  You know, what happens when I die?
[2282.96 --> 2286.66]  And how do I prepare myself for the reality of death
[2286.66 --> 2290.10]  and the eventuality of my dying?
[2291.24 --> 2292.94]  You know, the reason I'm talking about this
[2292.94 --> 2294.82]  is because in this passage this morning,
[2295.26 --> 2301.30]  there are two others there that day being crucified beside Jesus.
[2302.10 --> 2305.02]  One on his right and one on his left.
[2305.68 --> 2306.74]  And Jesus in the center.
[2307.10 --> 2312.60]  And they are referred to in the Gospels as thieves, as criminals, as robbers.
[2313.58 --> 2318.64]  And as Jesus and these other two hang bleeding on their cross,
[2319.34 --> 2323.84]  they're having a conversation about death and dying.
[2323.84 --> 2329.18]  And of all the people in all of the world,
[2329.88 --> 2332.88]  these two, have you realized this?
[2333.00 --> 2337.98]  These two have a unique perspective on the cross of Jesus, don't they?
[2338.92 --> 2339.18]  Right?
[2339.24 --> 2341.58]  They're not looking up at Jesus,
[2341.64 --> 2345.00]  like the soldiers and Jesus' mom
[2345.00 --> 2347.16]  and maybe some of the disciples who are standing there.
[2347.22 --> 2348.30]  And they're not looking up at him.
[2348.30 --> 2350.30]  They're not looking down on Jesus,
[2350.46 --> 2353.14]  like that great company of angels and prophets.
[2354.50 --> 2356.84]  They hang with him.
[2357.36 --> 2359.52]  Kind of like our painting shows here.
[2360.38 --> 2361.90]  Often when we think about the cross, right,
[2361.92 --> 2364.02]  we think about Jesus on the cross,
[2364.10 --> 2365.54]  but there were two others there with him.
[2365.72 --> 2368.50]  And these two others are beside him.
[2368.56 --> 2369.74]  And when they speak,
[2369.82 --> 2372.42]  they have to look and speak across Jesus.
[2372.42 --> 2378.80]  Of course, the robbers are preoccupied with their own troubles, aren't they?
[2379.92 --> 2382.56]  But they've been watching Jesus all along.
[2383.62 --> 2387.10]  They walked with him that same road out of the city
[2387.10 --> 2389.28]  up to the place of the skull.
[2390.52 --> 2394.50]  They had to drag their own crosses up the hill.
[2395.82 --> 2399.76]  They read what the Romans had written over Jesus' head,
[2399.84 --> 2401.60]  this strange charge against him.
[2401.60 --> 2403.20]  King of the Jews.
[2404.54 --> 2408.04]  They heard the taunts of the crowd passing by.
[2408.92 --> 2412.12]  They saw that there was enormous interest in Jesus,
[2412.64 --> 2415.00]  but that no one was interested much in them.
[2417.58 --> 2422.26]  Both robbers had seen and heard all of this
[2422.26 --> 2427.30]  from the perspective of knowing that they had to die beside him.
[2427.30 --> 2432.76]  But the two robbers, we'll note in this passage,
[2433.28 --> 2435.82]  respond differently to all that they see.
[2437.18 --> 2440.44]  And as we consider the suffering of Jesus on the cross,
[2440.54 --> 2445.00]  I believe that these two robbers stand in for us.
[2445.98 --> 2447.40]  They stand in for us.
[2447.80 --> 2450.94]  Because there are two ways to see Christ
[2450.94 --> 2452.42]  as he hangs there on the cross.
[2452.42 --> 2457.72]  On the one side, we have a cross of rebellion and fear.
[2458.48 --> 2461.38]  On the other side, we have a cross of repentance and faith.
[2461.68 --> 2465.04]  And in the center, we have a cross of redemption and friendship,
[2465.36 --> 2468.34]  where Jesus was offering up his life to God
[2468.34 --> 2470.96]  out of his love for us.
[2470.96 --> 2474.36]  And so here's our question for us this morning.
[2475.56 --> 2478.82]  Which robber resides in my heart?
[2481.06 --> 2484.14]  Which robber resides in my heart?
[2484.82 --> 2487.62]  Which robber voices my words?
[2488.26 --> 2491.58]  Which robber do I think like?
[2492.30 --> 2495.54]  And let's not take it for granted that we are the better of the two.
[2496.26 --> 2497.58]  Not automatically.
[2497.58 --> 2502.44]  This choice of how we respond to Jesus
[2502.44 --> 2507.14]  reminds me of this verse in Deuteronomy 30, verse 19,
[2507.66 --> 2509.82]  where Moses stands before the people and he says,
[2509.92 --> 2513.40]  I've set before you life and death, blessings and curses.
[2514.12 --> 2517.68]  Now choose life so that you may love the Lord your God,
[2518.42 --> 2522.00]  listen to his voice, and hold fast to him.
[2522.00 --> 2528.58]  Do you see that there is before us this tremendous choice?
[2529.36 --> 2532.66]  The two robbers, they had seen the exact same things.
[2533.16 --> 2536.62]  They had heard Jesus speak the exact same words just moments before.
[2536.76 --> 2538.10]  Father, forgive them.
[2538.56 --> 2543.38]  But their responses to Jesus are drastically different.
[2543.38 --> 2546.68]  There is a choice before us.
[2547.76 --> 2549.34]  That as Jesus is lifted up,
[2549.46 --> 2552.00]  you and I are confronted with the heart of Christ
[2552.00 --> 2553.84]  and with the words of Christ.
[2554.06 --> 2555.60]  What is your response?
[2556.88 --> 2559.24]  So this morning, I just wanted us to consider
[2559.24 --> 2561.78]  these three crosses this morning
[2561.78 --> 2563.26]  and ask ourselves this question,
[2563.82 --> 2566.64]  how am I responding to Jesus?
[2566.64 --> 2571.44]  So let's begin by considering the cross of rebellion.
[2573.00 --> 2573.70]  First one.
[2573.82 --> 2576.12]  And so then it says in verse 39,
[2576.48 --> 2577.44]  this is what it says.
[2578.36 --> 2580.22]  One of the criminals who hung there
[2580.22 --> 2582.22]  hurled insults at him.
[2582.34 --> 2583.54]  Aren't you the Messiah?
[2584.20 --> 2587.06]  Save yourself and us.
[2588.20 --> 2590.64]  This first robber thinks that the three of them
[2590.64 --> 2593.18]  hanging on this cross are unlucky.
[2593.18 --> 2596.42]  That they are victims.
[2597.28 --> 2599.94]  That they just got caught
[2599.94 --> 2601.54]  when so many others didn't.
[2601.98 --> 2602.58]  Bad luck.
[2604.56 --> 2607.28]  And the first robber's desire is pretty simple.
[2608.04 --> 2609.98]  Jesus, if you have the power,
[2610.56 --> 2611.64]  end the suffering.
[2612.74 --> 2614.06]  If you have the power,
[2614.52 --> 2615.34]  end the suffering.
[2616.80 --> 2618.92]  Save us from it now.
[2619.78 --> 2620.86]  Let's get down from here.
[2620.94 --> 2621.46]  Let's escape.
[2621.56 --> 2622.24]  Use your power.
[2622.24 --> 2624.26]  Remember, if you have it.
[2627.32 --> 2631.00]  As I listen to those words of the robber,
[2631.70 --> 2633.80]  sometimes I hear those echoes in my own heart.
[2636.54 --> 2638.56]  But notice with this first robber,
[2639.50 --> 2641.02]  there is no repentance.
[2642.52 --> 2642.74]  Right?
[2642.80 --> 2644.26]  If there was no pain and suffering
[2644.26 --> 2645.20]  that he was experiencing,
[2645.58 --> 2648.10]  he would have given no thought
[2648.10 --> 2649.88]  of who Jesus is.
[2649.88 --> 2653.64]  And if he got delivered from this cross,
[2653.70 --> 2654.56]  he's going to make sure
[2654.56 --> 2657.06]  that he's not going to get caught again.
[2657.74 --> 2659.28]  He's going to disappear into the crowd.
[2659.36 --> 2662.28]  He doesn't care about this offer of friendship and love.
[2662.44 --> 2664.58]  He only wants to be delivered back
[2664.58 --> 2666.38]  to his old life.
[2666.38 --> 2669.50]  And it says,
[2669.58 --> 2670.40]  as he hung there,
[2670.54 --> 2672.40]  he hurled insults at him.
[2673.06 --> 2673.26]  Right?
[2673.32 --> 2674.28]  Can you believe that?
[2674.50 --> 2675.18]  Think about that.
[2675.38 --> 2676.12]  This man,
[2676.22 --> 2678.28]  who is facing his own death,
[2678.34 --> 2679.36]  is so bitter,
[2679.64 --> 2680.82]  he is so angry,
[2681.34 --> 2683.74]  that even in his agony,
[2684.74 --> 2685.02]  right,
[2685.08 --> 2686.90]  where it is painful to even speak,
[2687.12 --> 2688.64]  in his last moments of life,
[2688.64 --> 2690.24]  he bothers,
[2690.54 --> 2691.44]  he has the energy
[2691.44 --> 2694.56]  to hurl insults at Jesus.
[2695.64 --> 2695.80]  Right?
[2695.86 --> 2697.92]  To insult the Savior of the world.
[2699.14 --> 2700.58]  That's the state of his heart.
[2702.72 --> 2703.80]  William Sangster
[2703.80 --> 2705.46]  was a Methodist preacher in England.
[2705.64 --> 2707.18]  And he said this of this man,
[2708.82 --> 2710.40]  and I'll have the quote here.
[2710.52 --> 2711.92]  He says that this man
[2711.92 --> 2713.60]  twisted the cross,
[2714.16 --> 2715.22]  doubled its pain,
[2715.58 --> 2716.66]  and missed its ministry.
[2716.66 --> 2717.30]  Right?
[2718.54 --> 2719.54]  Just think about how
[2719.54 --> 2722.02]  the tragedy of that,
[2723.32 --> 2724.78]  that he twisted the cross,
[2725.48 --> 2726.44]  doubled its pain,
[2726.94 --> 2728.12]  and missed its ministry.
[2729.28 --> 2729.78]  Right?
[2729.82 --> 2730.66]  And we can just listen
[2730.66 --> 2731.76]  to the mockery
[2731.76 --> 2734.24]  and the unbelief in his words.
[2734.64 --> 2736.00]  Aren't you the Messiah?
[2737.64 --> 2737.96]  Not,
[2738.08 --> 2740.04]  he's not saying that out of faith.
[2740.38 --> 2741.14]  Aren't you the Messiah?
[2741.26 --> 2741.36]  Right?
[2741.38 --> 2741.68]  He's saying,
[2741.94 --> 2742.60]  aren't you the Messiah?
[2743.54 --> 2745.84]  Save yourself and us.
[2746.66 --> 2747.06]  Right?
[2747.14 --> 2748.78]  But Jesus didn't come here
[2748.78 --> 2749.38]  to save himself,
[2749.48 --> 2749.70]  did he?
[2750.90 --> 2752.34]  He came to save those
[2752.34 --> 2754.00]  who were hurling insults at him,
[2754.08 --> 2755.64]  those who were crucifying him.
[2756.34 --> 2758.18]  And if he had come down
[2758.18 --> 2759.00]  off that cross,
[2759.18 --> 2761.08]  there could be no possibility
[2761.08 --> 2761.78]  of salvation.
[2762.54 --> 2762.70]  Right?
[2762.80 --> 2764.40]  And this robber didn't understand
[2764.40 --> 2765.60]  that it was necessary
[2765.60 --> 2767.12]  that Jesus die there.
[2767.12 --> 2767.22]  Right?
[2767.22 --> 2771.66]  Friends,
[2771.80 --> 2773.34]  God will not be mocked.
[2774.66 --> 2776.32]  And it's important to note here
[2776.32 --> 2776.92]  that Jesus
[2776.92 --> 2778.96]  has absolutely
[2778.96 --> 2780.62]  nothing to say
[2780.62 --> 2781.80]  to this man.
[2782.48 --> 2782.62]  Right?
[2782.68 --> 2783.24]  Did you notice that?
[2783.28 --> 2784.40]  He doesn't say anything to him.
[2784.44 --> 2785.12]  He doesn't respond.
[2785.42 --> 2787.28]  Not a word is given to this man
[2787.28 --> 2789.08]  because this man's heart is hard.
[2790.18 --> 2791.82]  He wasn't looking for forgiveness.
[2792.46 --> 2794.04]  He certainly wasn't looking
[2794.04 --> 2795.18]  for a relationship
[2795.18 --> 2796.84]  and love from Jesus.
[2797.40 --> 2798.74]  He didn't want Jesus
[2798.74 --> 2800.42]  to change him.
[2801.14 --> 2801.82]  And I'm certain that
[2801.82 --> 2803.14]  if Jesus did rescue him
[2803.14 --> 2804.26]  from that cross in some way,
[2804.58 --> 2805.78]  the man still wouldn't have
[2805.78 --> 2806.54]  believed in Jesus.
[2807.10 --> 2809.46]  Because he didn't want Jesus,
[2809.72 --> 2810.96]  he just wanted something
[2810.96 --> 2811.62]  from Jesus.
[2811.62 --> 2815.68]  And so as we think
[2815.68 --> 2816.96]  about this first robber,
[2817.68 --> 2818.50]  does this robber
[2818.50 --> 2819.36]  represent you
[2819.36 --> 2820.36]  in some way?
[2821.92 --> 2823.18]  Do you want Jesus
[2823.18 --> 2824.28]  to end the suffering
[2824.28 --> 2825.78]  in your life,
[2826.02 --> 2827.96]  to prove himself to you,
[2828.60 --> 2829.50]  and then you say,
[2829.60 --> 2830.72]  okay, I will believe in you
[2830.72 --> 2831.84]  and I will follow you?
[2832.92 --> 2834.38]  Are you making demands
[2834.38 --> 2834.90]  of Jesus
[2834.90 --> 2835.70]  that he give you
[2835.70 --> 2836.44]  this or that,
[2836.50 --> 2837.66]  but deep down in your heart
[2837.66 --> 2838.60]  you're not interested
[2838.60 --> 2840.04]  in the Savior?
[2841.62 --> 2842.38]  Because friends,
[2842.52 --> 2843.44]  Jesus is not,
[2843.84 --> 2844.06]  you know,
[2844.10 --> 2845.02]  I've heard this phrase,
[2845.82 --> 2847.44]  the cosmic Santa Claus.
[2848.20 --> 2848.44]  Right?
[2848.48 --> 2849.22]  He didn't come
[2849.22 --> 2850.38]  to give us everything
[2850.38 --> 2851.64]  that we ever wanted
[2851.64 --> 2852.28]  and dreamed.
[2852.38 --> 2853.92]  That's not his role.
[2854.86 --> 2855.80]  He came to show us
[2855.80 --> 2856.32]  that everything
[2856.32 --> 2857.26]  we ever wanted
[2857.26 --> 2857.94]  or dreamed of
[2857.94 --> 2860.00]  is found totally,
[2861.12 --> 2862.72]  absolutely in him
[2862.72 --> 2864.18]  and in him alone.
[2865.18 --> 2865.38]  Right?
[2865.42 --> 2866.38]  That the greatest gift
[2866.38 --> 2867.44]  that God can give us
[2867.44 --> 2869.30]  is God himself.
[2869.30 --> 2871.34]  And this man
[2871.34 --> 2872.18]  didn't want God.
[2872.40 --> 2873.14]  That's the problem,
[2873.22 --> 2873.38]  right?
[2874.46 --> 2875.64]  The greatest gift
[2875.64 --> 2876.86]  is God
[2876.86 --> 2878.86]  and he had no interest
[2878.86 --> 2879.58]  in that.
[2880.22 --> 2881.24]  He wanted rescue
[2881.24 --> 2882.16]  if it was possible,
[2882.46 --> 2883.26]  but he didn't even
[2883.26 --> 2883.82]  believe that.
[2884.66 --> 2885.88]  He was just mocking him.
[2887.10 --> 2888.02]  This is the cross
[2888.02 --> 2888.52]  of rebellion.
[2889.52 --> 2890.76]  This is what we have
[2890.76 --> 2891.64]  in this first cross,
[2891.72 --> 2892.62]  but in this passage,
[2893.04 --> 2893.20]  you know,
[2893.24 --> 2893.90]  that's kind of the,
[2893.98 --> 2894.74]  this kind of depressing
[2894.74 --> 2895.68]  side of things.
[2895.68 --> 2896.82]  It's very tragic.
[2896.82 --> 2899.14]  But also in this passage,
[2899.26 --> 2900.44]  we see on the other hand
[2900.44 --> 2902.26]  this beautiful picture
[2902.26 --> 2903.54]  of hope and possibility.
[2904.50 --> 2905.20]  And that's what we see
[2905.20 --> 2906.00]  in the second cross,
[2906.46 --> 2907.72]  the cross of repentance.
[2909.00 --> 2910.40]  So let's look here
[2910.40 --> 2912.70]  at the next passage
[2912.70 --> 2913.62]  or the next verses
[2913.62 --> 2914.38]  going forward.
[2915.72 --> 2917.26]  Verses 40 and 41.
[2917.38 --> 2918.00]  It says this.
[2918.84 --> 2919.88]  But the other criminal
[2919.88 --> 2921.26]  rebuked him.
[2921.70 --> 2922.80]  Don't you fear God,
[2922.86 --> 2923.26]  he said,
[2923.88 --> 2924.80]  since you are under
[2924.80 --> 2925.70]  the same sentence.
[2925.70 --> 2927.68]  We are punished justly
[2927.68 --> 2928.92]  for we are getting
[2928.92 --> 2930.60]  what our deeds deserve,
[2931.04 --> 2931.82]  but this man
[2931.82 --> 2934.06]  has done nothing wrong.
[2935.46 --> 2935.66]  All right?
[2935.70 --> 2937.00]  See how different this is.
[2937.26 --> 2938.02]  Night and day,
[2938.52 --> 2939.18]  the response
[2939.18 --> 2940.10]  of this other robber.
[2941.50 --> 2942.86]  And notice the effect
[2942.86 --> 2944.30]  that Jesus has on him.
[2945.42 --> 2946.44]  There is something
[2946.44 --> 2948.32]  beautiful about Jesus.
[2948.70 --> 2949.50]  There is something
[2949.50 --> 2951.88]  so kind in Jesus,
[2952.00 --> 2952.70]  so otherworldly.
[2953.56 --> 2955.02]  He has this magnetism,
[2955.02 --> 2956.02]  this graciousness
[2956.60 --> 2957.48]  about him.
[2958.08 --> 2959.24]  I would have loved
[2959.24 --> 2960.08]  to see that.
[2962.04 --> 2963.24]  That it actually,
[2963.50 --> 2964.68]  in Jesus' presence,
[2964.80 --> 2965.60]  for this robber,
[2965.74 --> 2966.60]  it softens
[2966.60 --> 2968.14]  and it changes his heart.
[2969.52 --> 2970.30]  Because what does
[2970.30 --> 2970.94]  this man do?
[2971.04 --> 2972.02]  He actually rebukes
[2972.60 --> 2973.52]  the other robber.
[2974.22 --> 2974.42]  Right?
[2974.46 --> 2975.74]  He cries out to him
[2975.74 --> 2976.12]  and says,
[2976.28 --> 2977.82]  don't you fear God?
[2979.26 --> 2979.74]  Right?
[2979.82 --> 2980.60]  Isn't that interesting?
[2981.42 --> 2981.92]  He says,
[2982.06 --> 2984.08]  don't you fear God?
[2984.08 --> 2987.72]  The fear of the Lord.
[2988.34 --> 2988.56]  Right?
[2988.64 --> 2989.50]  What does the fear
[2989.50 --> 2990.22]  of the Lord do?
[2990.30 --> 2991.10]  What happens
[2991.10 --> 2992.42]  when the fear
[2992.42 --> 2992.94]  of the Lord
[2992.94 --> 2994.34]  comes into a person's
[2994.34 --> 2995.70]  heart and mind?
[2996.78 --> 2997.70]  Well, listen to this.
[2998.38 --> 2999.28]  Here's how the book
[2999.28 --> 3000.02]  of Proverbs
[3000.02 --> 3001.14]  talks about the fear
[3001.14 --> 3001.66]  of the Lord.
[3003.12 --> 3004.04]  Proverbs 8,
[3004.14 --> 3004.88]  verse 13.
[3005.30 --> 3006.46]  To fear the Lord
[3006.46 --> 3008.42]  is to hate evil.
[3009.76 --> 3010.24]  Right?
[3010.24 --> 3011.14]  Notice that unlike
[3011.14 --> 3012.18]  the first thief,
[3012.58 --> 3013.42]  this thief
[3013.42 --> 3014.96]  sees his own sin.
[3016.12 --> 3016.52]  He says,
[3016.72 --> 3017.58]  we are getting
[3017.58 --> 3019.42]  what we deserve.
[3020.42 --> 3021.52]  He saw the evil
[3021.52 --> 3022.52]  in himself
[3022.52 --> 3024.70]  and in the other thief.
[3026.90 --> 3027.98]  Proverbs 9,
[3028.14 --> 3028.68]  verse 10.
[3029.56 --> 3030.50]  The fear of the Lord
[3030.50 --> 3031.28]  is the beginning
[3031.28 --> 3032.38]  of wisdom.
[3033.38 --> 3033.96]  Right?
[3034.02 --> 3034.80]  The fear of the Lord
[3034.80 --> 3035.66]  gave him wisdom
[3035.66 --> 3038.04]  about who Jesus is.
[3038.04 --> 3039.20]  He says,
[3039.56 --> 3040.72]  this man is innocent.
[3041.14 --> 3041.88]  This man has done
[3041.88 --> 3042.58]  nothing wrong.
[3044.02 --> 3044.18]  Right?
[3044.22 --> 3045.04]  The fear of the Lord
[3045.04 --> 3046.14]  opened his eyes.
[3046.28 --> 3047.04]  He gave him insight
[3047.04 --> 3048.42]  into who Jesus is.
[3049.24 --> 3049.68]  Then,
[3050.16 --> 3051.42]  Proverbs 14,
[3051.52 --> 3052.16]  27.
[3053.72 --> 3055.10]  The fear of the Lord
[3055.10 --> 3056.78]  is the fountain,
[3057.26 --> 3058.86]  is a fountain of life,
[3059.20 --> 3060.14]  turning a person
[3060.14 --> 3062.14]  from the snares of death.
[3063.42 --> 3063.86]  He,
[3064.06 --> 3066.12]  he sees life in Jesus.
[3066.12 --> 3066.28]  Jesus.
[3067.64 --> 3068.54]  Something that
[3068.54 --> 3069.74]  he did not have.
[3069.80 --> 3071.22]  He's dying on the cross.
[3072.02 --> 3073.06]  He's thinking about
[3073.06 --> 3073.86]  life,
[3074.24 --> 3074.76]  rescue,
[3074.90 --> 3075.54]  and salvation,
[3075.54 --> 3077.06]  and he sees
[3077.06 --> 3077.98]  that this man,
[3078.06 --> 3078.74]  Jesus Christ,
[3079.22 --> 3079.86]  has it.
[3080.80 --> 3082.20]  He wants the life
[3082.20 --> 3083.22]  of the eternal kingdom
[3083.22 --> 3084.56]  where Jesus will reign
[3084.56 --> 3085.22]  as king.
[3085.94 --> 3086.96]  He wants to be delivered
[3086.96 --> 3087.72]  from the suffering,
[3087.84 --> 3088.68]  but he doesn't want to go back
[3088.68 --> 3089.72]  to his old life.
[3090.18 --> 3091.54]  He wants to go forward.
[3091.64 --> 3092.24]  He wants to go into
[3092.24 --> 3093.18]  a new life.
[3094.02 --> 3095.52]  He wants true salvation.
[3095.52 --> 3096.90]  He wants restoration
[3096.90 --> 3099.40]  of his life with God.
[3100.08 --> 3101.42]  He wants to remain
[3101.42 --> 3102.24]  with Jesus
[3102.24 --> 3103.56]  even after the suffering
[3103.56 --> 3104.10]  is over.
[3104.68 --> 3106.28]  He wants this offering
[3106.28 --> 3107.04]  of love
[3107.04 --> 3108.12]  and friendship.
[3109.88 --> 3110.62]  So we see
[3110.62 --> 3111.70]  in the second,
[3111.86 --> 3113.28]  Robber's response
[3113.28 --> 3113.78]  to Jesus
[3113.78 --> 3114.34]  in awareness
[3114.34 --> 3115.20]  of his own sin,
[3115.86 --> 3116.56]  in acknowledgement
[3116.56 --> 3117.78]  of who Christ is
[3117.78 --> 3118.54]  as the Messiah,
[3119.06 --> 3120.08]  the king who has come,
[3120.82 --> 3121.60]  in a desire
[3121.60 --> 3122.90]  to be changed
[3122.90 --> 3124.92]  and to be with Jesus.
[3126.30 --> 3126.88]  And then listen
[3126.88 --> 3127.94]  to his request
[3127.94 --> 3128.94]  in verse 32.
[3130.52 --> 3131.48]  Then he said,
[3132.02 --> 3132.30]  Jesus,
[3133.02 --> 3134.50]  remember me
[3134.50 --> 3135.34]  when you come
[3135.34 --> 3136.48]  into your kingdom.
[3137.40 --> 3137.62]  Right?
[3137.70 --> 3138.34]  Isn't that interesting?
[3138.46 --> 3139.16]  Notice he doesn't,
[3139.28 --> 3140.70]  he doesn't even ask
[3140.70 --> 3141.12]  for anything,
[3141.12 --> 3141.60]  does he?
[3143.68 --> 3144.90]  He just says,
[3145.00 --> 3146.22]  will you remember me?
[3148.16 --> 3148.34]  Right?
[3148.44 --> 3149.78]  He knows his sin.
[3149.98 --> 3151.40]  He sees who Jesus is.
[3151.46 --> 3152.26]  He doesn't presume
[3152.26 --> 3153.22]  anything that he could
[3153.22 --> 3154.32]  ask anything of God.
[3154.58 --> 3155.04]  He just says,
[3155.10 --> 3156.00]  would you remember me?
[3157.64 --> 3159.06]  And there must have been
[3159.06 --> 3160.56]  in Jesus something,
[3161.38 --> 3163.14]  a look in Jesus' eyes,
[3163.78 --> 3165.50]  a look of love
[3165.50 --> 3166.54]  and compassion
[3166.54 --> 3168.32]  that would just draw
[3168.32 --> 3169.00]  this man
[3169.00 --> 3170.44]  as Jesus is lifted up
[3170.44 --> 3172.70]  where he sees Jesus saying,
[3173.00 --> 3174.10]  this is what I'm here for.
[3174.28 --> 3175.28]  That I am here
[3175.28 --> 3175.98]  to give you something
[3175.98 --> 3177.28]  that you don't deserve.
[3177.38 --> 3178.54]  I'm here to give you life.
[3178.54 --> 3179.88]  And this man
[3179.88 --> 3180.88]  just receives it.
[3183.32 --> 3184.62]  He believed Jesus
[3184.62 --> 3185.50]  was the way
[3185.50 --> 3187.12]  and he entered
[3187.12 --> 3187.98]  through him.
[3189.50 --> 3190.58]  And so let me ask you
[3190.58 --> 3191.08]  this morning,
[3191.54 --> 3192.50]  is yours
[3192.50 --> 3194.04]  a cross of repentance?
[3196.42 --> 3197.60]  We're all going to suffer.
[3197.74 --> 3198.52]  We're all going to hang
[3198.52 --> 3199.12]  on a cross
[3199.12 --> 3200.14]  at some point
[3200.14 --> 3201.00]  in our lives.
[3201.34 --> 3202.62]  And when that happens,
[3203.02 --> 3205.02]  what is your response?
[3205.08 --> 3206.24]  Is it a response
[3206.24 --> 3207.84]  where you say
[3207.84 --> 3209.02]  that there is
[3209.02 --> 3210.70]  nothing in me,
[3210.82 --> 3212.26]  there is no ability
[3212.26 --> 3213.18]  to save myself?
[3214.18 --> 3215.02]  And I have nothing
[3215.02 --> 3215.98]  to bring before God,
[3216.04 --> 3216.16]  right?
[3216.22 --> 3217.26]  This thief had nothing
[3217.26 --> 3220.40]  to bring to Jesus.
[3220.76 --> 3221.48]  He had nothing to bring.
[3221.56 --> 3222.44]  His hands were literally
[3222.44 --> 3223.32]  nailed to a cross.
[3224.34 --> 3226.04]  He was a convicted criminal.
[3226.18 --> 3226.82]  The only thing
[3226.82 --> 3227.80]  he could simply do
[3227.80 --> 3229.90]  is respond in faith
[3229.90 --> 3231.14]  to the beauty
[3231.14 --> 3231.92]  and the forgiveness
[3231.92 --> 3232.56]  and the love
[3232.56 --> 3233.26]  of Jesus Christ
[3233.26 --> 3234.06]  that the Holy Spirit
[3234.06 --> 3235.06]  was working
[3235.06 --> 3235.88]  in his heart.
[3237.96 --> 3238.88]  That's the cross
[3238.88 --> 3239.94]  of repentance.
[3240.64 --> 3241.28]  And that's why
[3241.28 --> 3241.92]  we look to this
[3241.92 --> 3242.66]  third cross
[3242.66 --> 3243.60]  because it brings
[3243.60 --> 3245.06]  explanation
[3245.06 --> 3246.10]  to all of these
[3246.10 --> 3246.66]  other crosses
[3246.66 --> 3248.36]  and it is the cross
[3248.36 --> 3248.84]  of redemption,
[3248.98 --> 3249.80]  the cross of Christ.
[3250.96 --> 3251.80]  Because what does
[3251.80 --> 3252.98]  Jesus say to him
[3252.98 --> 3253.76]  in verse 43?
[3254.40 --> 3255.82]  He turns to this robber
[3255.82 --> 3256.60]  and you can imagine
[3256.60 --> 3258.02]  this heart full of compassion
[3258.02 --> 3259.30]  and he says,
[3259.90 --> 3261.12]  truly I tell you,
[3261.44 --> 3262.28]  the next verse,
[3262.28 --> 3263.70]  truly I tell you,
[3263.76 --> 3264.48]  today you will be
[3264.48 --> 3265.20]  with me in paradise.
[3267.44 --> 3269.46]  Jesus has the authority
[3269.46 --> 3271.28]  and the power
[3271.28 --> 3273.36]  to promise redemption.
[3275.30 --> 3276.38]  The robber asked
[3276.38 --> 3277.06]  that Jesus would
[3277.06 --> 3278.50]  simply remember him
[3278.50 --> 3279.12]  and Jesus says,
[3279.32 --> 3280.32]  I can do better than that.
[3280.84 --> 3283.48]  I can grant immediate access
[3283.48 --> 3285.42]  into paradise with me.
[3285.56 --> 3286.24]  When you die,
[3286.32 --> 3287.32]  you will wake up in paradise.
[3288.00 --> 3288.98]  That's what Jesus is saying.
[3288.98 --> 3290.10]  He welcomes this man
[3290.10 --> 3291.96]  into paradise itself.
[3292.54 --> 3293.30]  And this is amazing
[3293.30 --> 3294.84]  because think about this.
[3296.12 --> 3297.72]  The Jews of Jesus' day,
[3297.86 --> 3298.66]  their understanding
[3298.66 --> 3299.74]  of paradise was that
[3299.74 --> 3301.08]  it was a dwelling place
[3301.08 --> 3301.72]  for who?
[3302.54 --> 3303.32]  The righteous.
[3304.54 --> 3305.38]  It's a dwelling place
[3305.38 --> 3305.84]  for the righteous.
[3306.32 --> 3307.52]  The place the righteous
[3307.52 --> 3308.92]  would go to dwell
[3308.92 --> 3309.80]  after death.
[3310.88 --> 3311.64]  In the Old Testament,
[3312.00 --> 3312.28]  if you,
[3312.90 --> 3314.12]  the place of the dead
[3314.12 --> 3315.06]  where you would go
[3315.06 --> 3316.32]  is called paradise.
[3317.82 --> 3318.38]  Now,
[3318.38 --> 3319.98]  who is Jesus
[3319.98 --> 3321.32]  letting into paradise?
[3322.28 --> 3324.22]  someone righteous?
[3325.32 --> 3325.76]  No.
[3326.66 --> 3326.92]  Right?
[3327.08 --> 3328.18]  Not someone righteous,
[3328.34 --> 3329.58]  not someone who kept the law,
[3329.78 --> 3330.94]  but a convicted criminal.
[3333.38 --> 3334.28]  Is that amazing?
[3334.28 --> 3335.74]  For the Jews,
[3335.80 --> 3336.34]  that would have been
[3336.34 --> 3337.12]  astonishing.
[3337.12 --> 3338.38]  A convicted criminal.
[3339.38 --> 3339.88]  And this is,
[3339.98 --> 3341.48]  this is the extravagant
[3341.48 --> 3342.72]  grace of the gospel.
[3343.62 --> 3344.58]  And this final word
[3344.58 --> 3345.68]  of Jesus from the cross
[3345.68 --> 3346.56]  is just,
[3346.70 --> 3346.84]  you know,
[3346.88 --> 3347.38]  it's one of these
[3347.38 --> 3348.56]  amazing verses.
[3349.62 --> 3350.04]  Right?
[3350.08 --> 3350.60]  It's one of those,
[3350.72 --> 3351.42]  these verses
[3351.42 --> 3351.96]  in the,
[3351.96 --> 3352.90]  in the Christian life
[3352.90 --> 3353.38]  that we,
[3353.54 --> 3354.94]  that we hold on to,
[3355.30 --> 3356.74]  that we love,
[3356.80 --> 3357.86]  that comforts us,
[3357.86 --> 3358.82]  and gives us courage.
[3358.82 --> 3360.38]  Right?
[3360.60 --> 3362.10]  Jesus says that anyone,
[3362.48 --> 3363.46]  even a criminal
[3363.46 --> 3364.76]  who is hanging on the cross,
[3365.10 --> 3366.44]  anyone who puts their trust
[3366.44 --> 3367.04]  in Jesus,
[3367.74 --> 3370.78]  is granted immediate access
[3370.78 --> 3372.24]  into paradise with him.
[3373.32 --> 3374.58]  All the man did
[3374.58 --> 3375.94]  is recognize his need
[3375.94 --> 3376.24]  and say,
[3376.34 --> 3376.60]  Jesus,
[3376.76 --> 3377.34]  remember me.
[3377.84 --> 3379.56]  And he was instantly saved.
[3381.10 --> 3382.74]  And so I hope that you would,
[3382.90 --> 3383.60]  this morning,
[3384.54 --> 3385.60]  receive that promise.
[3386.30 --> 3387.64]  Receive that promise of Jesus.
[3387.64 --> 3388.08]  Right?
[3389.08 --> 3390.42]  Allow that to speak
[3390.42 --> 3392.84]  into the fears
[3392.84 --> 3393.92]  that you may have
[3393.92 --> 3395.04]  about death and dying.
[3396.50 --> 3397.44]  Often when we're in that
[3397.44 --> 3398.42]  first stage of life
[3398.42 --> 3399.06]  I talked about,
[3399.12 --> 3400.08]  we're thinking about the future,
[3400.20 --> 3400.90]  we're thinking about
[3400.90 --> 3402.08]  just the life that God
[3402.08 --> 3402.80]  might have for us,
[3402.84 --> 3404.04]  we're not thinking about death.
[3406.22 --> 3407.30]  Maybe some of you
[3407.30 --> 3409.08]  are in kind of the second
[3409.08 --> 3410.52]  or third stage of life
[3410.52 --> 3411.66]  and increasingly,
[3412.26 --> 3414.52]  that question is on your mind.
[3415.92 --> 3417.54]  What's going to happen to me
[3417.54 --> 3418.54]  when I die?
[3419.54 --> 3421.20]  And we have all kinds of fears
[3421.20 --> 3422.00]  and anxieties
[3422.00 --> 3423.32]  about that,
[3423.38 --> 3423.74]  don't we?
[3424.86 --> 3426.80]  But allow this promise
[3426.80 --> 3427.44]  of Jesus
[3427.44 --> 3430.32]  to speak
[3430.32 --> 3431.96]  words of peace
[3431.96 --> 3433.46]  into your fear.
[3435.86 --> 3437.80]  Because what Jesus promises here
[3437.80 --> 3438.68]  is that death
[3438.68 --> 3440.64]  is just more life.
[3441.64 --> 3442.04]  Right?
[3442.04 --> 3443.04]  for those who look
[3443.04 --> 3443.72]  to Jesus,
[3444.16 --> 3445.82]  dying is waking up.
[3446.62 --> 3447.88]  Our final breath
[3447.88 --> 3448.72]  in this life
[3448.72 --> 3449.58]  as we know it
[3449.58 --> 3450.72]  is followed by
[3450.72 --> 3452.16]  our first breath
[3452.16 --> 3453.76]  in the presence
[3453.76 --> 3454.76]  of God.
[3455.82 --> 3456.76]  Just like that.
[3458.52 --> 3459.58]  So what does that mean?
[3459.82 --> 3460.64]  It means that Christians
[3460.64 --> 3461.98]  do not need to fear death.
[3461.98 --> 3465.86]  And even though
[3465.86 --> 3467.06]  these words of Jesus
[3467.06 --> 3467.88]  are comforting,
[3468.28 --> 3469.06]  they still leave us
[3469.06 --> 3469.78]  many questions.
[3470.84 --> 3471.42]  On the one hand,
[3471.46 --> 3472.28]  we could be comforted,
[3472.52 --> 3473.54]  but, you know,
[3473.70 --> 3473.96]  man,
[3474.10 --> 3475.64]  we sure have questions.
[3475.72 --> 3475.86]  Like,
[3476.02 --> 3477.30]  what is this paradise
[3477.30 --> 3478.62]  that Jesus is talking about?
[3478.98 --> 3479.74]  Where is it?
[3480.20 --> 3481.36]  What will it be like?
[3482.02 --> 3482.84]  And we wish
[3482.84 --> 3483.40]  that Jesus,
[3483.56 --> 3484.22]  in this passage,
[3484.22 --> 3485.24]  as much as we love
[3485.24 --> 3486.70]  this little pithy verse,
[3486.98 --> 3487.86]  today you will be with me
[3487.86 --> 3488.34]  in paradise,
[3488.34 --> 3488.72]  we're like,
[3489.24 --> 3489.60]  okay,
[3490.10 --> 3491.30]  maybe if you could have
[3491.30 --> 3493.24]  elaborated just a moment longer
[3493.24 --> 3494.06]  on that,
[3494.26 --> 3495.54]  we would have appreciated it.
[3496.66 --> 3496.96]  You know,
[3497.04 --> 3497.88]  and there's all kinds
[3497.88 --> 3498.54]  of speculation
[3498.54 --> 3500.78]  about what Jesus means here
[3500.78 --> 3501.60]  by this word paradise.
[3501.72 --> 3502.06]  There are books
[3502.06 --> 3502.78]  written about it.
[3503.10 --> 3503.74]  There are other books
[3503.74 --> 3506.20]  written in conversation
[3506.20 --> 3507.48]  with others.
[3508.60 --> 3509.68]  But I would argue
[3509.68 --> 3511.86]  that all of those discussions
[3511.86 --> 3512.76]  are not significant.
[3513.22 --> 3514.54]  That what is significant,
[3514.76 --> 3516.06]  what is most important
[3516.06 --> 3517.84]  about paradise
[3517.84 --> 3520.10]  is that it is face-to-face
[3520.10 --> 3520.66]  with Jesus.
[3522.16 --> 3523.26]  That's the most important
[3523.26 --> 3523.84]  thing, isn't it?
[3524.80 --> 3525.46]  Jesus says,
[3525.70 --> 3527.02]  today you will be what?
[3528.36 --> 3529.52]  With me.
[3530.30 --> 3531.74]  With me in paradise.
[3532.86 --> 3533.72]  In other words,
[3533.78 --> 3534.52]  what makes paradise
[3534.52 --> 3535.66]  paradise is the fact
[3535.66 --> 3536.86]  that Jesus is going
[3536.86 --> 3537.28]  to be there.
[3538.24 --> 3538.98]  And this means,
[3539.10 --> 3540.40]  this means that this man
[3540.40 --> 3542.02]  has the companionship,
[3542.48 --> 3543.48]  the relationship,
[3544.04 --> 3546.00]  the love restored to God
[3546.00 --> 3547.36]  with Jesus.
[3547.36 --> 3547.84]  Jesus.
[3547.84 --> 3549.08]  That's what makes
[3549.08 --> 3549.74]  heaven heaven,
[3550.26 --> 3551.08]  is being with Jesus.
[3553.74 --> 3554.80]  So let me sum up
[3554.80 --> 3555.76]  what we've been talking about.
[3556.42 --> 3557.42]  What I want us to see
[3557.42 --> 3557.92]  this morning
[3557.92 --> 3558.50]  is that there are
[3558.50 --> 3559.86]  three crosses before us
[3559.86 --> 3561.08]  and that in these
[3561.08 --> 3561.62]  three crosses
[3561.62 --> 3562.76]  we find ourselves
[3562.76 --> 3564.30]  faced with two choices.
[3565.08 --> 3565.98]  On the one hand,
[3566.04 --> 3566.58]  there's the cross
[3566.58 --> 3567.28]  of rebellion
[3567.28 --> 3569.26]  and on the other side
[3569.26 --> 3570.00]  we have the cross
[3570.00 --> 3570.60]  of repentance
[3570.60 --> 3571.64]  but in the center
[3571.64 --> 3572.38]  we have the cross
[3572.38 --> 3572.96]  of redemption,
[3573.66 --> 3574.40]  Jesus crucified,
[3574.40 --> 3575.44]  Jesus our savior,
[3575.62 --> 3576.72]  Jesus who bore
[3576.72 --> 3577.64]  our sins
[3577.64 --> 3579.14]  in our place
[3579.14 --> 3580.36]  and who calls us
[3580.36 --> 3581.94]  to look to him
[3581.94 --> 3582.52]  in faith
[3582.52 --> 3585.00]  and to be redeemed,
[3585.24 --> 3586.36]  to be delivered.
[3586.90 --> 3587.44]  That's what both
[3587.44 --> 3588.18]  of those robbers want.
[3588.24 --> 3589.06]  They want to be delivered
[3589.06 --> 3590.90]  and Jesus offers
[3590.90 --> 3591.72]  that deliverance.
[3592.84 --> 3594.72]  The question for us is
[3594.72 --> 3596.02]  which voice
[3596.02 --> 3597.10]  of these robbers
[3597.10 --> 3598.14]  sounds most
[3598.14 --> 3599.12]  like my voice?
[3599.12 --> 3601.78]  Do I resist
[3601.78 --> 3602.68]  the love of God
[3602.68 --> 3603.28]  and the friendship
[3603.28 --> 3603.90]  of God?
[3604.70 --> 3605.46]  Do I just want
[3605.46 --> 3606.46]  my old life?
[3606.52 --> 3607.04]  Do I want Jesus
[3607.04 --> 3607.94]  to come into my life
[3607.94 --> 3608.80]  so I can live
[3608.80 --> 3610.06]  my old life
[3610.06 --> 3611.06]  of self-protection
[3611.06 --> 3612.60]  in my old ways?
[3613.96 --> 3615.20]  Or do I long
[3615.20 --> 3616.20]  for what the love
[3616.20 --> 3617.66]  of God offers me
[3617.66 --> 3618.54]  in Jesus Christ
[3618.54 --> 3620.08]  not only restored
[3620.08 --> 3620.54]  to God
[3620.54 --> 3621.28]  but that Jesus
[3621.28 --> 3622.18]  would change me?
[3622.46 --> 3623.32]  That I wouldn't go back
[3623.32 --> 3623.98]  to my old life
[3623.98 --> 3624.92]  but I would go forward
[3624.92 --> 3626.20]  to a new life
[3626.20 --> 3627.02]  and be changed
[3627.02 --> 3628.08]  by this relationship
[3628.08 --> 3630.10]  that Jesus offers us.
[3631.52 --> 3632.32]  You know because
[3632.32 --> 3633.64]  forgiveness of our sins
[3633.64 --> 3634.22]  as we looked at
[3634.22 --> 3634.98]  last point
[3634.98 --> 3635.76]  last time
[3635.76 --> 3636.82]  where Jesus says
[3636.82 --> 3637.80]  Father forgive them
[3637.80 --> 3638.80]  they know not what they do.
[3638.92 --> 3639.84]  That is part of
[3639.84 --> 3640.96]  the Christian life
[3640.96 --> 3642.12]  that is part of salvation
[3642.12 --> 3644.34]  but it's not the only thing.
[3644.74 --> 3645.14]  Salvation
[3645.14 --> 3646.86]  is also restoration
[3646.86 --> 3648.70]  of our friendship
[3648.70 --> 3649.26]  with God.
[3650.34 --> 3651.30]  This is what
[3651.30 --> 3652.28]  Jesus offers us
[3652.28 --> 3653.74]  and you have a choice
[3653.74 --> 3654.70]  before you today.
[3655.42 --> 3656.18]  You have a choice
[3656.18 --> 3656.70]  before you.
[3656.70 --> 3658.62]  Jesus stands before us
[3658.62 --> 3658.96]  and he says
[3658.96 --> 3659.54]  come to me
[3659.54 --> 3660.38]  all who are weary
[3660.38 --> 3661.70]  and heavy laden
[3661.70 --> 3663.62]  and I will give rest
[3663.62 --> 3664.64]  for your souls.
[3665.96 --> 3666.40]  So friends
[3666.40 --> 3667.50]  if you are weary
[3667.50 --> 3668.72]  and if you are suffering
[3668.72 --> 3671.22]  come to Jesus.
[3671.94 --> 3673.92]  And if you are walking
[3673.92 --> 3675.06]  away from Jesus
[3675.06 --> 3676.88]  come to Jesus.
[3677.68 --> 3678.96]  And if you don't yet
[3678.96 --> 3680.28]  know who Jesus is
[3680.28 --> 3681.22]  he invites you
[3681.22 --> 3682.12]  right now
[3682.12 --> 3683.40]  to come to him
[3683.40 --> 3684.64]  and to receive him
[3684.64 --> 3685.20]  by faith.
[3686.32 --> 3687.22]  Let's pray together.
[3693.40 --> 3693.88]  Father
[3693.88 --> 3694.40]  when
[3694.40 --> 3696.44]  I first
[3696.44 --> 3697.22]  read this passage
[3697.22 --> 3697.92]  I would always
[3697.92 --> 3698.84]  make the mistake
[3698.84 --> 3699.42]  of thinking
[3699.42 --> 3700.94]  automatically
[3700.94 --> 3702.38]  I'm the second thief.
[3704.78 --> 3705.50]  But Lord
[3705.50 --> 3706.78]  would you help me
[3706.78 --> 3707.64]  and help each one
[3707.64 --> 3708.18]  of us Lord
[3708.18 --> 3709.60]  to consider
[3709.60 --> 3712.16]  these two perspectives
[3712.16 --> 3713.28]  on the cross of Christ.
[3713.84 --> 3714.72]  Lord to repent
[3714.72 --> 3716.32]  of our rebellion
[3716.32 --> 3717.20]  wherever we may
[3717.20 --> 3718.24]  find that in ourselves.
[3719.72 --> 3720.34]  And Lord
[3720.34 --> 3721.36]  to turn to you
[3721.36 --> 3721.94]  in trust
[3721.94 --> 3722.62]  and repentance.
[3723.18 --> 3723.46]  And Lord
[3723.46 --> 3724.18]  most of all
[3724.18 --> 3724.88]  Lord we thank you
[3724.88 --> 3725.50]  for the
[3725.50 --> 3727.48]  mercy of our Lord Jesus
[3727.48 --> 3728.48]  that even as he
[3728.48 --> 3729.58]  hung on the cross
[3729.58 --> 3730.48]  spoke
[3730.48 --> 3732.16]  these astounding
[3732.16 --> 3732.94]  words
[3732.94 --> 3734.24]  of promise
[3734.24 --> 3735.14]  and hope
[3735.14 --> 3736.62]  that
[3736.62 --> 3737.72]  for all
[3737.72 --> 3738.14]  those
[3738.14 --> 3738.44]  even
[3738.44 --> 3739.24]  criminals
[3739.24 --> 3739.76]  nailed
[3739.76 --> 3740.42]  to a cross
[3740.42 --> 3741.42]  condemned
[3741.42 --> 3743.42]  that in your sight
[3743.42 --> 3744.78]  there's no condemnation
[3744.78 --> 3746.36]  and that if we would
[3746.36 --> 3747.08]  just turn
[3747.08 --> 3748.96]  our hearts
[3748.96 --> 3750.20]  in faith
[3750.20 --> 3750.82]  toward Jesus
[3750.82 --> 3751.42]  he says
[3751.42 --> 3752.10]  today
[3752.10 --> 3753.26]  immediately
[3753.26 --> 3754.68]  you will be
[3754.68 --> 3755.14]  with me
[3755.14 --> 3755.72]  in paradise.
[3755.90 --> 3756.50]  Lord we thank you
[3756.50 --> 3757.26]  for the gospel
[3757.26 --> 3758.04]  that is unlike
[3758.04 --> 3759.24]  anything else.
[3760.84 --> 3761.04]  And Lord
[3761.04 --> 3761.64]  help us to
[3761.64 --> 3762.58]  respond to it
[3762.58 --> 3764.58]  by your Holy Spirit
[3764.58 --> 3765.70]  in faith.
[3765.84 --> 3766.82]  We pray in Jesus name.
[3767.26 --> 3767.48]  Amen.
[3769.60 --> 3770.50]  Let's all stand
[3770.50 --> 3771.74]  and let's sing

[3805.58 --> 3808.04]  taste of glory
[3808.04 --> 3809.90]  divine
[3809.90 --> 3812.50]  There has salvation
[3812.50 --> 3815.90]  purchase of God
[3815.90 --> 3818.62]  Born of his spirit
[3818.62 --> 3821.42]  washed in his blood
[3821.42 --> 3824.60]  This is my story

[3850.58 --> 3853.58]  Vision of rapture
[3853.58 --> 3856.58]  The first on thy side
[3856.58 --> 3859.58]  Angels descending
[3859.58 --> 3860.58]  Rage from above
[3860.58 --> 3861.58]  Rage from above
[3861.58 --> 3862.58]  Rage from above

[3901.58 --> 3904.58]  I am happy and blessed
[3904.58 --> 3907.58]  Watching and waiting
[3907.58 --> 3908.58]  Looking above
[3908.58 --> 3911.58]  Filled with his goodness
[3911.58 --> 3912.58]  Lost in his love
[3912.58 --> 3914.58]  With his goodness
[3914.58 --> 3917.58]  Lost in his love
[3917.58 --> 3920.58]  This is my story

[3939.58 --> 3943.58]  All the day long
[3960.58 --> 3963.58]  We come now to our time of offering
[3963.58 --> 3966.58]  This is written in the Old Testament
[3966.58 --> 3969.58]  No one shall come before me empty handed
[3971.58 --> 3973.58]  The offering today is for Regent College
[3973.58 --> 3975.58]  A place many of us know well
[3975.58 --> 3977.58]  A place many of us have attended
[3977.58 --> 3980.58]  Several people in our congregation
[3980.58 --> 3982.58]  They have gotten their degrees from that place
[3982.58 --> 3983.58]  They are now pastors
[3985.58 --> 3987.58]  And a place, if you don't know it
[3987.58 --> 3990.58]  I would invite you to attend sometime
[3990.58 --> 3991.58]  There are summer lectures
[3991.58 --> 3992.58]  And evening lectures
[3992.58 --> 3994.58]  And short courses
[3994.58 --> 3995.58]  And long courses
[3995.58 --> 3997.58]  A great place
[3997.58 --> 3998.58]  Right on campus at UBC
[3998.58 --> 4001.58]  So our collection is for
[4001.58 --> 4005.58]  The Regent College
[4005.58 --> 4010.58]  And it will be the normal thing
[4010.58 --> 4011.58]  We will pass the baskets
[4011.58 --> 4013.58]  But you can also donate in the back
[4013.58 --> 4017.58]  Or via electronically
[4017.58 --> 4019.58]  Whatever way you choose
[4019.58 --> 4031.58]  Again that we were introduced to last week
[4031.58 --> 4032.58]  His mercy is more
[4032.58 --> 4034.58]  So please join in as you feel comfortable
[4034.58 --> 4035.58]  Be comfortable
[4035.58 --> 4050.58]  Praise the Lord
[4050.58 --> 4051.58]  His mercy is more
[4051.58 --> 4052.58]  His mercy is more
[4052.58 --> 4053.58]  His mercy is more
[4053.58 --> 4057.58]  His mercy is more
[4057.58 --> 4063.58]  Stronger the darkness
[4063.58 --> 4067.58]  Through every room
[4067.58 --> 4069.58]  Our sins they already
[4069.58 --> 4071.58]  His mercy is more
[4071.58 --> 4072.58]  His mercy is more
[4072.58 --> 4073.58]  But love could remember
[4073.58 --> 4074.58]  His mercy is more
[4074.58 --> 4075.58]  But love could remember
[4075.58 --> 4076.58]  No wrongs we have done
[4076.58 --> 4077.58]  But love could remember
[4077.58 --> 4078.58]  But love could remember
[4078.58 --> 4079.58]  But love could remember
[4079.58 --> 4081.58]  No wrongs we have done
[4081.58 --> 4082.58]  But love could remember
[4082.58 --> 4083.58]  No wrongs we have done
[4083.58 --> 4085.58]  Omnish and all knowing
[4085.58 --> 4086.58]  He counts not the song
[4086.58 --> 4087.58]  No wrongs we have done
[4087.58 --> 4088.58]  To love could remember
[4088.58 --> 4089.58]  He counts not the song
[4089.58 --> 4091.58]  Though the angel has seen
[4091.58 --> 4093.58]  Without love or shore
[4093.58 --> 4095.58]  Our sins they are many
[4095.58 --> 4098.58]  His mercy is more
[4098.58 --> 4099.58]  Our sins they are many
[4099.58 --> 4103.58]  His mercy is more
[4103.58 --> 4114.58]  What patience would wait
[4114.58 --> 4117.58]  As we constantly roam
[4117.58 --> 4120.58]  What Father so tender
[4120.58 --> 4123.58]  Is calling us home
[4123.58 --> 4126.58]  He welcomes the weakest
[4126.58 --> 4130.58]  The violence of all
[4130.58 --> 4134.58]  Our sins they are many
[4134.58 --> 4137.58]  His mercy is more
[4137.58 --> 4142.58]  Praise the Lord
[4142.58 --> 4149.58]  His mercy is more
[4149.58 --> 4153.58]  Stronger the darkness
[4153.58 --> 4155.58]  You will remind
[4155.58 --> 4159.58]  Our sins they are many
[4159.58 --> 4162.58]  His mercy is more
[4162.58 --> 4166.58]  For riches of kindness
[4166.58 --> 4169.58]  He lavished on us
[4169.58 --> 4172.58]  His love was a payment
[4172.58 --> 4175.58]  His life was a cost
[4175.58 --> 4178.58]  We stood with the debt
[4178.58 --> 4182.58]  We could never afford
[4182.58 --> 4186.58]  Our sins they are many
[4186.58 --> 4187.58]  His mercy is more
[4187.58 --> 4191.58]  His mercy is more
[4191.58 --> 4196.58]  Praise the Lord
[4196.58 --> 4201.58]  His mercy is more
[4201.58 --> 4207.58]  Stronger the darkness
[4207.58 --> 4209.58]  You will remind
[4209.58 --> 4212.58]  Our sins they are many
[4212.58 --> 4213.58]  His mercy is more
[4213.58 --> 4215.58]  His mercy is more
[4215.58 --> 4217.58]  Praise the Lord
[4217.58 --> 4219.58]  His mercy is more
[4219.58 --> 4221.58]  His mercy is more
[4221.58 --> 4222.58]  His mercy is more
[4222.58 --> 4225.58]  His mercy is more
[4225.58 --> 4226.58]  Stronger the darkness
[4226.58 --> 4227.58]  His mercy is more
[4227.58 --> 4228.58]  His mercy is more
[4228.58 --> 4233.58]  His mercy is more
[4233.58 --> 4234.58]  His mercy is more
[4234.58 --> 4243.58]  His mercy is more
[4243.58 --> 4246.58]  Than you
[4246.58 --> 4250.58]  We come now to a time of prayer
[4250.58 --> 4253.58]  A prayer of all of us together
[4253.58 --> 4255.58]  So let us pray
[4255.58 --> 4261.58]  Our Lord and Father
[4261.58 --> 4264.58]  We come before you this Sunday morning
[4264.58 --> 4266.58]  And outside spring comes on
[4266.58 --> 4269.58]  All the birds, the animals, the plants
[4269.58 --> 4272.58]  Know what to do since you have created them
[4272.58 --> 4275.58]  And amidst all that new beauty
[4275.58 --> 4279.58]  We also remember the suffering of our Lord Jesus
[4279.58 --> 4282.58]  How he, through whom all this beauty was made
[4282.58 --> 4286.58]  Faced humiliation and death for our sake
[4286.58 --> 4291.58]  Lord, we thank you for all the beauty around us
[4291.58 --> 4295.58]  That we thank you even more for what you did to save us
[4295.58 --> 4298.58]  And to make us your own
[4298.58 --> 4304.58]  Lord, in your mercy together, hear our prayer
[4304.58 --> 4310.58]  Lord, we thank you for this congregation
[4310.58 --> 4313.58]  For mutual support and encouragement
[4313.58 --> 4315.58]  That comes from your spirit at work
[4315.58 --> 4319.58]  We thank you for the baptism of Ezra Klomps
[4319.58 --> 4325.58]  Be with him and Peter and Carrie and all of us, Lord
[4325.58 --> 4329.58]  We know him as a member of us
[4329.58 --> 4333.58]  Be with our pastors, Nancy and Jason
[4333.58 --> 4335.58]  And with all the elders and deacons
[4335.58 --> 4338.58]  And many more who are active in one way or another
[4338.58 --> 4339.58]  In our church
[4339.58 --> 4342.58]  Fill us all with your spirit
[4342.58 --> 4345.58]  We pray for the lonely among us
[4345.58 --> 4349.58]  Widows, and widowers, singles
[4349.58 --> 4352.58]  Those who are in institutions and hospitals
[4352.58 --> 4354.58]  And the sick among us
[4354.58 --> 4363.58]  Especially we pray for Joan
[4363.58 --> 4365.58]  May your presence and love surround her
[4365.58 --> 4367.58]  As she lies in hospice
[4367.58 --> 4370.58]  And be with Jerry and all the family around her
[4370.58 --> 4373.58]  May hold up to you
[4373.58 --> 4379.58]  Doug and Pat and Joyce and Carl
[4379.58 --> 4385.58]  And Grace and Mark and Hank and Jerry and Anne
[4385.58 --> 4391.58]  And Shirley and Diane and Jeanette and John and Henry
[4391.58 --> 4396.58]  Father, we ask for your healing and comfort
[4396.58 --> 4398.58]  Such as only you can give
[4398.58 --> 4401.58]  They are all in your hands
[4401.58 --> 4402.58]  Be near them
[4402.58 --> 4407.58]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer
[4407.58 --> 4413.58]  Lord, we pray for your church worldwide
[4413.58 --> 4417.58]  We confess that there are divisions among us
[4417.58 --> 4419.58]  That have no place in your kingdom
[4419.58 --> 4422.58]  Grant us the wisdom and love
[4422.58 --> 4425.58]  To seek true reconciliation
[4425.58 --> 4427.58]  And make us one
[4427.58 --> 4430.58]  In many places around the world
[4430.58 --> 4433.58]  Your brothers and sisters face persecution
[4433.58 --> 4435.58]  Father, sustain them
[4435.58 --> 4438.58]  That they may be your witnesses
[4438.58 --> 4440.58]  In other places
[4440.58 --> 4442.58]  The worries of this life
[4442.58 --> 4444.58]  And the deceitfulness of wealth
[4444.58 --> 4446.58]  Lure people away from you
[4446.58 --> 4449.58]  Lord, lead us not into temptation
[4449.58 --> 4450.58]  But protect us
[4450.58 --> 4453.58]  From the vows of the evil one
[4453.58 --> 4457.58]  Bless the work of missionaries
[4457.58 --> 4458.58]  And evangelists
[4458.58 --> 4459.58]  And doctors
[4459.58 --> 4460.58]  And aid workers
[4460.58 --> 4463.58]  And Lord, we pray for this world
[4463.58 --> 4466.58]  There is a terrible war going on in Ukraine
[4466.58 --> 4468.58]  There are famines
[4468.58 --> 4471.58]  Wars and oppression in other places
[4471.58 --> 4475.58]  Lord, grant relief
[4475.58 --> 4477.58]  We pray
[4477.58 --> 4480.58]  Lord, in your mercy
[4480.58 --> 4482.58]  Hear our prayer
[4482.58 --> 4486.58]  Father, we pray for our nation
[4486.58 --> 4489.58]  Guide our prime minister and premier
[4489.58 --> 4491.58]  And mayors
[4491.58 --> 4493.58]  And their governments
[4493.58 --> 4495.58]  In the way of righteousness
[4495.58 --> 4497.58]  So that justice and peace
[4497.58 --> 4500.58]  May prevail for all peoples of this land
[4501.58 --> 4503.58]  Father, supply in all our needs
[4503.58 --> 4505.58]  As we seek your kingdom
[4506.58 --> 4508.58]  Lord, we wait
[4509.58 --> 4511.58]  For the return of our Lord Jesus
[4512.58 --> 4514.58]  And the establishment of your kingdom
[4514.58 --> 4515.58]  In all its fullness
[4516.58 --> 4518.58]  All this we ask in his name
[4520.58 --> 4521.58]  Lord, in your great mercy

[4565.58 --> 4567.58]  And to present you before his glorious presence

[4608.86 --> 4615.86]  Who sits upon their throne
[4615.86 --> 4621.86]  And unto their land
