[236.94 --> 238.94]  Amen.
[266.94 --> 268.94]  Amen.
[296.94 --> 298.94]  Amen.
[326.94 --> 328.94]  Well, good morning.
[328.94 --> 329.94]  Good morning.
[329.94 --> 330.94]  Good morning.
[330.94 --> 333.94]  And welcome, everyone, to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[333.94 --> 334.94]  My name is Jake Cron.
[334.94 --> 340.94]  I'll be leading the portion of the service this morning, and certainly want to welcome
[340.94 --> 341.94]  everyone.
[341.94 --> 346.94]  Especially if you're a guest here, we're blessed by your presence among us and hope that we
[346.94 --> 348.94]  in turn can bless you.
[348.94 --> 354.94]  Just a few announcements before we begin our service.
[354.94 --> 360.94]  Next weekend is Thanksgiving already, right?
[360.94 --> 363.94]  And just an encouragement for everyone.
[363.94 --> 365.94]  It's a busy time.
[365.94 --> 367.94]  A lot of people, a lot of us, have family.
[367.94 --> 369.94]  We want to get together with that weekend.
[369.94 --> 374.94]  And just an encouragement for us to remember that there might be some among us that don't
[374.94 --> 379.94]  have any place to go for Thanksgiving, any family or friends to be with.
[379.94 --> 384.94]  Just, you know, if it's on your heart, if you're aware of somebody, you know, please just invite them over
[384.94 --> 389.94]  and just have a good day fellowship with them as well and include them in your day.
[389.94 --> 394.94]  Also, next week, our offering is for South Delta Food Bank.
[394.94 --> 399.94]  So we're encouraged to bring a food item with us for donation to that cause.
[399.94 --> 402.94]  And lastly, two general announcements.
[402.94 --> 405.94]  There are still sign-up sheets on that table in the foyer.
[405.94 --> 409.94]  I know it's a busy table, but if you look for them, there's two sign-up sheets for ESL classes,
[409.94 --> 413.94]  if you or anyone you know could benefit from those.
[413.94 --> 420.94]  And also for our small groups ministry, which we're starting to rekindle this fall.
[420.94 --> 426.94]  And lastly, cross-training is ongoing, 9.30 in the morning in the church.
[426.94 --> 430.94]  So if you've got it on your heart to come to that, no need to sign up.
[430.94 --> 432.94]  You can just show up.
[432.94 --> 434.94]  I think that was it.
[434.94 --> 442.94]  When we see clearly, our lives are transformed.
[442.94 --> 453.94]  But seeing God clearly, recognizing Christ, and perceiving the anointing of God requires the work and light of the Holy Spirit.
[453.94 --> 459.94]  When we have the light of the Spirit, we see God and understand things more fully.
[459.94 --> 464.94]  We see others with the eyes of Christ.
[464.94 --> 467.94]  God does not value us for what we look like.
[467.94 --> 472.94]  God sees into our hearts and knows what we feel and believe.
[472.94 --> 476.94]  Anyone can be called by God to achieve greatness.
[476.94 --> 482.94]  And everyone is cared for by the Good Shepherd who gives us all that we need.
[482.94 --> 490.94]  For we are all children of light, created by the one who is light, and in whom there is no darkness at all.
[490.94 --> 504.94]  Yet, we are also all blind and in need of healing, so that we might be the sight of God, clear and undistorted by our sin, our hurts, our agendas, and our prejudices.
[504.94 --> 510.94]  The light of the world shines, and the darkness that is in the world has not overcome it.
[510.94 --> 512.94]  Not in our individual lives.
[512.94 --> 514.94]  Not in our collective lives.
[514.94 --> 517.94]  Not in the history of the world as a whole.
[517.94 --> 519.94]  The light will not be extinguished.
[519.94 --> 522.94]  We must let it shine through us.
[522.94 --> 529.94]  With that in mind, hear this call of worship based on readings in Ephesians 5 and John 9.
[529.94 --> 534.94]  When the world is dark and full of hate and fear.
[534.94 --> 536.94]  When we cannot see God.
[536.94 --> 540.94]  When we cannot find our way back to love and peace.
[540.94 --> 544.94]  When our vision dims due to the darkness within.
[544.94 --> 547.94]  Christ opens our eyes with the gift of sight.
[547.94 --> 551.94]  Come and worship the one who brings sight to the blind.
[551.94 --> 556.94]  Now is a good time to stand if you can.
[556.94 --> 559.94]  Take a moment, greet those around you, welcome them to our service.
[559.94 --> 561.94]  Then our praise teams will lead us in three songs.
[574.94 --> 577.30]  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, this is the time
[577.30 --> 607.28]  Thank you.
[607.30 --> 637.28]  Thank you.
[637.30 --> 639.30]  Thank you.
[667.30 --> 669.30]  Thank you.
[697.30 --> 699.30]  Thank you.
[699.30 --> 701.30]  Thank you.
[701.30 --> 703.30]  Thank you.
[703.30 --> 705.30]  Thank you.
[705.30 --> 707.30]  Thank you.
[707.30 --> 737.30] 
[737.30 --> 739.30]  Thank you.
[739.30 --> 741.30]  Thank you.
[741.30 --> 743.30]  Thank you.
[743.30 --> 745.30]  Thank you.
[745.30 --> 747.30]  Thank you.
[747.30 --> 749.30]  Thank you.
[749.30 --> 751.30]  Thank you.
[751.30 --> 753.30]  Thank you.
[753.30 --> 755.30]  Thank you.
[755.30 --> 760.88]  But God shall so rejoice.
[766.34 --> 772.32]  I'm just going to read a passage from Timothy 3.16.
[774.96 --> 778.78]  Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great.
[779.44 --> 782.98]  He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit,
[782.98 --> 786.36]  was seen by angels, was preached among the nations,
[786.62 --> 790.64]  was believed on in the world, and was taken up into glory.
[796.22 --> 797.80]  Behold the wondrous mystery.
[807.42 --> 812.12]  Come behold the wondrous mystery
[812.12 --> 816.82]  in the dawning of the King.
[817.32 --> 821.50]  Be the flame of heaven's praises,
[822.00 --> 825.12]  roamed in frail humanity.
[826.58 --> 830.74]  In our longing, in our darkness,
[831.42 --> 835.12]  now the light of thy past power.
[835.12 --> 840.46]  Looked to Christ who condescended,
[840.82 --> 845.50]  took on flesh to ransom us.
[851.50 --> 856.60]  Come behold the wondrous mystery.
[856.60 --> 861.48]  Be the perfect Son of man.
[861.48 --> 865.98]  In his living, in his suffering,
[865.98 --> 870.72]  never trace nor save of sin.
[870.72 --> 875.76]  See the true and better Adam,
[875.76 --> 879.98]  come to save the hell of them.
[879.98 --> 885.18]  Christ the great and true fulfillment,
[885.18 --> 890.36]  of the law in him we stand.
[896.36 --> 901.68]  Come behold the wondrous mystery.
[901.68 --> 906.38]  Christ the Lord upon the tree.
[906.38 --> 911.28]  In the stead of wounded sinners,
[911.56 --> 914.98]  thanks the Lamb of victory.
[916.38 --> 920.34]  See the price of our redemption.
[920.34 --> 925.54]  See the waters to the road.
[925.54 --> 930.26]  Bring in many sons to glory.
[930.26 --> 935.54]  Grace unmeasured, love untorned.
[935.54 --> 946.86]  Come behold the wondrous mystery.
[947.42 --> 951.88]  Slain by death the God of life.
[951.88 --> 956.78]  But no grave could ever slain him.
[957.14 --> 961.38]  Praise the Lord, he is alive.
[961.38 --> 966.38]  What a foretaste of deliverance.
[966.38 --> 971.04]  How unwavering our hope.
[971.04 --> 975.58]  Worse and power, resurrection,
[975.58 --> 980.62]  as we will be when he comes.
[980.62 --> 985.64]  What a foretaste of deliverance.
[985.64 --> 990.30]  How unwavering our hope.
[991.38 --> 996.38]  Christ in power, resurrection,
[996.38 --> 1003.38]  as we will be when he comes.
[1010.38 --> 1012.58]  You may be seated for our next song.
[1012.58 --> 1034.58]  The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[1034.58 --> 1041.58]  His mercies never come to a hell.
[1041.58 --> 1046.58]  They are new every morning.
[1046.58 --> 1049.58]  New every morning.
[1049.58 --> 1055.58]  Great is your faithfulness, O Lord.
[1055.58 --> 1059.58]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[1059.58 --> 1060.58]  O Lord.
[1060.58 --> 1061.58]  Sing that again.
[1061.58 --> 1066.58]  The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[1066.58 --> 1067.58]  His mercies never come to a hell.
[1067.58 --> 1073.58]  His mercies never come to a hell.
[1073.58 --> 1075.58]  They are new every morning.
[1075.58 --> 1077.58]  New every morning.
[1077.58 --> 1079.58]  New every morning.
[1079.58 --> 1081.58]  Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[1081.58 --> 1088.58]  Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[1088.58 --> 1094.58]  Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[1094.58 --> 1099.58]  Father, we thank you for your blessings overnight and this morning as we have gotten up and been
[1099.58 --> 1101.58]  free to come here and worship.
[1101.58 --> 1102.58]  Thank you for the sun.
[1102.58 --> 1105.58]  We thank you for all that you provide for us.
[1105.58 --> 1110.58]  And we praise and thank you for that in Jesus name.
[1110.58 --> 1111.58]  Amen.
[1111.58 --> 1126.58]  Our call to confession this morning comes from Isaiah 55.
[1126.58 --> 1133.58]  Hear the word of God that calls to us to our confession of sin.
[1133.58 --> 1135.58]  Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[1135.58 --> 1138.58]  Call on him while he is near.
[1138.58 --> 1142.58]  Let the wicked forsake their way and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[1142.58 --> 1148.58]  Let them return to the Lord that he may have mercy on them and to our God for he will abundantly
[1148.58 --> 1149.58]  pardon.
[1149.58 --> 1152.58]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1152.58 --> 1158.58]  O Lord, we seek you today.
[1158.58 --> 1161.58]  We seek you for your grace and mercy for us.
[1161.58 --> 1166.58]  We ask for mercy on us as individuals for we are sinful.
[1166.58 --> 1171.58]  We ask for mercy on us as a group for many of our sins are corporate.
[1172.58 --> 1177.58]  In your mercy, forgive our sins and lead us to forsake our evil ways.
[1177.58 --> 1182.58]  We come in the name of your son, our savior, Jesus Christ.
[1182.58 --> 1183.58]  Amen.
[1183.58 --> 1190.58]  We can all be assured that as God has promised in the words of Isaiah 55, if we turn to him,
[1190.58 --> 1194.58]  he will have mercy and will abundantly pardon.
[1194.58 --> 1199.58]  So we can have confidence from the word of God, our sins are forgiven.
[1199.58 --> 1203.58]  Let's celebrate by singing the river.
[1203.58 --> 1208.58]  And after that, our kids, for kids life, I think it's three through grade seven.
[1208.58 --> 1209.58]  Yeah.
[1209.58 --> 1210.58]  Are welcome to go to kids life.
[1210.58 --> 1211.58]  Oh, sorry.
[1211.58 --> 1212.58]  Five.
[1212.58 --> 1213.58]  I think I got the sign.
[1213.58 --> 1214.58]  Yeah.
[1214.58 --> 1215.58]  Three through grade five.
[1215.58 --> 1217.58]  We Systems would deliver not all the Coupleślzy
[1217.58 --> 1220.58]  But should all come here with us, for the presentation of our Bible begins.
[1220.58 --> 1224.58]  As we are continuing, the Lordкр andứiąxs by changing our soul, our collision of our Selfdom.
[1224.58 --> 1226.58]  He must take us sideways under the weight of He� and service to the Mauliancu.
[1226.58 --> 1240.04]  To the river I am going, winning sins I cannot bear.
[1240.04 --> 1253.12]  Come and cleanse me, come forgive me, Lord I need to meet you there.
[1256.58 --> 1267.28]  In these waters, healing mercy flows with freedom from despair.
[1267.28 --> 1281.08]  I am going to that river, Lord I need to meet you there.
[1281.08 --> 1293.08]  Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1294.64 --> 1299.70]  Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1301.08 --> 1305.08]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1305.08 --> 1315.08]  Come and join us in the river.
[1316.36 --> 1320.08]  Come and fight beyond compare.
[1320.08 --> 1333.08]  He is calling, he is waiting, Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1333.08 --> 1346.08]  He is calling, he is waiting, Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1346.08 --> 1358.08]  Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1358.08 --> 1364.08]  Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1364.08 --> 1371.08]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1371.08 --> 1377.08]  Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1377.08 --> 1383.08]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1383.08 --> 1408.08]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1408.08 --> 1413.08]  The scripture reading today is from Ephesians 5, verse 1 to 14.
[1413.08 --> 1416.08]  You can find it on page 871 in your pew Bibles.
[1416.08 --> 1421.08]  It is a slightly different version, but it is the same gist there.
[1421.08 --> 1427.08]  Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children, and walk in the way of love,
[1427.08 --> 1434.08]  just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[1434.08 --> 1444.08]  But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed,
[1444.08 --> 1447.08]  because these are improper for God's holy people.
[1447.08 --> 1456.08]  Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
[1456.08 --> 1466.08]  For of this you can be sure, no immoral, impure, or greedy person, such a person is an idolater,
[1466.08 --> 1471.08]  has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[1471.08 --> 1479.08]  Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
[1479.08 --> 1483.08]  Therefore, do not be partners with them.
[1483.08 --> 1488.08]  For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[1488.08 --> 1490.08]  Live as children of light.
[1490.08 --> 1495.08]  For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
[1495.08 --> 1498.08]  And find out what pleases the Lord.
[1498.08 --> 1504.08]  Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
[1504.08 --> 1509.08]  It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
[1509.08 --> 1517.08]  But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.
[1517.08 --> 1519.08]  This is why it is said,
[1519.08 --> 1525.08]  Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
[1525.08 --> 1527.08]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1527.08 --> 1529.08]  Thanks be to God.
[1529.08 --> 1530.08]  Amen.
[1534.08 --> 1543.08]  Good morning.
[1543.08 --> 1550.08]  So that song we just sang, By the River, it's written by Brian something.
[1550.08 --> 1551.08]  Dirkster.
[1551.08 --> 1552.08]  Dirkster, okay.
[1552.08 --> 1554.08]  So he's having a concert tonight.
[1554.08 --> 1555.08]  Maybe you saw it in The Optimist.
[1555.08 --> 1557.08]  It's at 7 p.m. in Swanson Alliance.
[1557.08 --> 1560.08]  He's a Juno winning songwriter.
[1560.08 --> 1562.08]  And so we can come see it.
[1562.08 --> 1564.08]  So participate in that time of worship.
[1564.08 --> 1566.08]  It's tonight at 7 p.m.
[1566.08 --> 1567.08]  I think you can find tickets.
[1567.08 --> 1569.08]  If you just Google it, I'm sure you'll find it.
[1569.08 --> 1581.08]  So today we are continuing to read a letter that the Apostle Paul wrote from prison to his friends in the ancient Roman city of Ephesus.
[1581.08 --> 1590.08]  Now Paul was a Jew who persecuted Christians because he was zealous for his own culture and his religion.
[1590.08 --> 1596.08]  But then he encountered Jesus in a vision and he became a follower of Christ.
[1596.08 --> 1602.08]  His friends in Ephesus were from a very different religious and cultural background.
[1602.08 --> 1606.08]  They were Gentiles.
[1606.08 --> 1614.08]  But now they also believe that Jesus is the Savior, the Messiah sent by God into the world.
[1614.08 --> 1627.08]  And since they are not from a Jewish background, lots of things that were just normal, a normal part of life for the Ephesians were not the will of God.
[1627.08 --> 1633.08]  So Paul wrote to them to tell them how to please God with their lives.
[1633.08 --> 1638.08]  He told them that there were some things that they needed to stop doing.
[1638.08 --> 1643.08]  They needed to, Paul uses this language of put off and put on.
[1643.08 --> 1646.08]  There are some things that they needed to put off.
[1646.08 --> 1650.08]  And instead there were some new practices that they needed to learn.
[1650.08 --> 1652.08]  Now it makes sense.
[1652.08 --> 1655.08]  It makes sense that Paul had to write to them about this.
[1655.08 --> 1664.08]  Because you see, the love of God and the change that divine love expects is part of a bigger story.
[1664.08 --> 1675.08]  It's a story about how God's good creation, how good it is, his creation, but how messed up it has become.
[1675.08 --> 1681.08]  It's a story about how good it is to be made in the image of God as men and women.
[1681.08 --> 1683.08]  But how we messed that up too.
[1683.08 --> 1690.08]  Our reflection of God's glory is now dimmed and distorted because of our sin.
[1690.08 --> 1694.08]  And the Jews knew more of this story than the Gentiles.
[1694.08 --> 1695.08]  Right?
[1695.08 --> 1698.08]  Because God had revealed himself in a special way to the Jews.
[1698.08 --> 1703.08]  And through the law, he taught his people how to live in a way that truly flourishes.
[1703.08 --> 1707.08]  How God created us to live as men and women in the world.
[1707.08 --> 1715.08]  And then God sent Jesus into the world to be savior of all people, both Jews and Gentiles.
[1715.08 --> 1719.08]  And to bring everyone into this covenant relationship with God.
[1719.08 --> 1724.08]  In which they could also learn how to live in the light of God's holy purity.
[1724.08 --> 1732.08]  So Paul wrote this long ago to a people in a culture that is very different from ours.
[1732.08 --> 1735.08]  But the story is still for us.
[1735.08 --> 1736.08]  We're part of this story.
[1736.08 --> 1741.08]  And this letter is still for us today.
[1741.08 --> 1746.08]  Paul needed to teach the Ephesians because God's story wasn't natural to them.
[1746.08 --> 1751.08]  And we need to learn many of the same things.
[1751.08 --> 1753.08]  So let's pray.
[1753.08 --> 1759.08]  And let's ask for God's help as we hear his word to us this morning.
[1759.08 --> 1761.08]  Please join me in prayer.
[1761.08 --> 1764.08]  Holy and good Lord.
[1764.08 --> 1771.08]  Father, our master, our king, and our friend, and our savior.
[1771.08 --> 1775.08]  We thank you for the truth and the beauty of your word.
[1775.08 --> 1780.08]  And Father, we thank you that you have given us your word because you love us.
[1780.08 --> 1788.08]  Father, this morning, right now, and in this place, we ask for your spirit to be at work among us, your people.
[1788.08 --> 1791.08]  Father, help us not to resist you.
[1791.08 --> 1801.08]  Help us to trust that when you ask us to change, it is always for the best.
[1801.08 --> 1802.08]  Even if it hurts.
[1802.08 --> 1803.08]  Even if it hurts.
[1803.08 --> 1804.08]  Even if it's hard.
[1804.08 --> 1809.08]  And we pray all this with joy and with confidence.
[1809.08 --> 1810.08]  In Jesus' name.
[1810.08 --> 1811.08]  Amen.
[1811.08 --> 1814.08]  So I am from the East Coast.
[1814.08 --> 1817.08]  Anybody else from the East Coast?
[1817.08 --> 1818.08]  Just get a show of hands.
[1818.08 --> 1819.08]  Okay, one person.
[1819.08 --> 1820.08]  Two.
[1820.08 --> 1821.08]  Okay, good.
[1821.08 --> 1830.08]  Now, the fashion back where I'm from on the East Coast is khakis, khaki pants, and polo shirts.
[1830.08 --> 1835.08]  Usually kind of bright colored shirts and brown khaki colored pants.
[1835.08 --> 1837.08]  So that's what I wore in high school.
[1837.08 --> 1838.08]  That's what I wore in university.
[1838.08 --> 1844.08]  But in university, I had a professor who wore black jeans.
[1844.08 --> 1847.08]  Now, I thought this was really cool.
[1847.08 --> 1853.08]  But I wasn't brave enough to follow him and wear black jeans because that's not what my classmates wore.
[1853.08 --> 1859.08]  Now, it turns out he had his PhD from Berkeley on the West Coast.
[1859.08 --> 1864.08]  And he was a politics professor, so I think he fashioned himself as kind of like a revolutionary.
[1864.08 --> 1869.08]  But he was very cool in his black jeans on the East Coast.
[1869.08 --> 1870.08]  Very countercultural.
[1870.08 --> 1874.08]  Now, here I am on the West Coast.
[1874.08 --> 1879.08]  People wear black jeans and dark shirts.
[1879.08 --> 1885.08]  And almost no one wears polo shirts or khaki pants.
[1885.08 --> 1891.08]  And if I, when I first moved here, I used to wear my khaki pants, and I just felt so out of place.
[1891.08 --> 1893.08]  I didn't feel like I belonged.
[1893.08 --> 1896.08]  You could tell I'm an outsider.
[1896.08 --> 1910.08]  But whether you wear a polo shirt or a black t-shirt, whether you wear khakis or black jeans, it's still fashion.
[1910.08 --> 1914.08]  And we are still following the example of other people.
[1914.08 --> 1918.08]  Here on the West Coast, we don't dress like people on the East Coast.
[1918.08 --> 1922.08]  And we don't dress like first century Ephesians either.
[1922.08 --> 1927.08]  We keep to the fashion of our own community to show that we belong.
[1927.08 --> 1932.08]  And to show whose example we want to follow.
[1932.08 --> 1943.08]  As there are fashions in our clothes, there are also fashions in more important things in life, in more important ways.
[1943.08 --> 1949.08]  There are fashions in what we approve of and what we disapprove of.
[1949.08 --> 1956.08]  What counts as a virtue and what counts as a flaw.
[1956.08 --> 1964.08]  What is right speech, right sexual behavior, right things to believe.
[1964.08 --> 1968.08]  Like fashions, these things change over time.
[1968.08 --> 1971.08]  And they're different depending on where you are from.
[1971.08 --> 1973.08]  But we influence each other.
[1973.08 --> 1976.08]  We are all following examples.
[1976.08 --> 1981.08]  So whose example should we follow?
[1981.08 --> 1987.08]  Well, Paul writes to his friends in Ephesus this advice in verse 1.
[1987.08 --> 1990.08]  He says, follow God's example.
[1990.08 --> 1995.08]  Therefore, as dearly loved children, and walk in the ways of love.
[1995.08 --> 1998.08]  Right? Doesn't it make sense?
[1998.08 --> 2002.08]  God should be the example of what we approve.
[2002.08 --> 2005.08]  Right? No matter what culture we belong to.
[2005.08 --> 2008.08]  No matter what century we live in.
[2008.08 --> 2013.08]  Our role model for the way of love is Jesus Christ.
[2013.08 --> 2020.08]  And this is as true for the Ephesians as it is for our brothers and sisters on the East Coast.
[2020.08 --> 2023.08]  As it is for us today.
[2023.08 --> 2025.08]  As God's holy people.
[2025.08 --> 2027.08]  And that is who you are.
[2027.08 --> 2029.08]  That is what Paul calls us.
[2029.08 --> 2031.08]  God's holy people.
[2031.08 --> 2036.08]  As God's holy people, we should let him influence us.
[2036.08 --> 2038.08]  By his example.
[2038.08 --> 2040.08]  In every way.
[2040.08 --> 2046.08]  We are to show in every fashion that we belong to Christ.
[2046.08 --> 2049.08]  And what is the example of Christ?
[2049.08 --> 2050.08]  What is the way of love?
[2050.08 --> 2052.08]  Paul continues in verse 2.
[2052.08 --> 2055.08]  He says, follow God's example.
[2055.08 --> 2057.08]  Therefore, as dearly loved children.
[2057.08 --> 2058.08]  Walk in the way of love.
[2058.08 --> 2061.08]  Just as Christ loved us.
[2061.08 --> 2066.08]  And gave himself for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[2066.08 --> 2070.08]  See, look at those words of an offering and a sacrifice.
[2070.08 --> 2075.08]  See, the Ephesians knew all about sacrificing at temples.
[2075.08 --> 2080.08]  They knew all about burning incense to the old gods.
[2080.08 --> 2085.08]  This was immensely important for first century Roman Christians.
[2085.08 --> 2086.08]  Or for Romans.
[2086.08 --> 2087.08]  Everybody.
[2087.08 --> 2089.08]  Everybody worshiped the gods.
[2089.08 --> 2090.08]  Right?
[2090.08 --> 2091.08]  Right?
[2091.08 --> 2095.08]  It was so deeply ingrained into their culture and their way of life.
[2095.08 --> 2096.08]  It wasn't just a personal choice.
[2096.08 --> 2098.08]  Am I going to worship at this temple or not?
[2098.08 --> 2101.08]  Everybody worshiped at the temples.
[2103.08 --> 2110.08]  But for these first century Christians, when they became followers of Jesus, they stopped worshiping at the temples.
[2110.08 --> 2114.08]  They no longer offered the sacrifices to their household gods.
[2114.08 --> 2116.08]  Or to their city gods.
[2116.08 --> 2121.08]  Or to the gods of their professional guilds.
[2121.08 --> 2128.08]  And this put them as outsiders of their own culture.
[2128.08 --> 2133.08]  Because by participating in temple worship, you showed that you belonged to the community.
[2133.08 --> 2136.08]  That you shared their values and beliefs.
[2136.08 --> 2145.08]  And not only that, but the common belief was that by worshiping the gods, you secured the blessing and the favor of the gods on the whole community.
[2145.08 --> 2154.08]  And if you didn't do that, if we didn't worship the gods, get their blessing, well, bad things are going to happen.
[2154.08 --> 2156.08]  There might be crop failures.
[2156.08 --> 2157.08]  There might be war.
[2157.08 --> 2165.08]  So by not joining in the temple worship, Christians were seen as unloving and uncaring of their neighbors.
[2165.08 --> 2169.08]  People didn't care that they worshiped another god, Jesus.
[2169.08 --> 2173.08]  But they did care that they stopped worshiping the other gods as well.
[2173.08 --> 2178.08]  It was very hard for Christians to give up this former way of life.
[2178.08 --> 2181.08]  It required an enormous sacrifice.
[2181.08 --> 2188.08]  But now, like the example of Christ, their very lives were to become a sacrifice of worship.
[2188.08 --> 2192.08]  And the same is true of us.
[2192.08 --> 2193.08]  Right?
[2193.08 --> 2201.08]  What sacrifice are we not willing to make because we don't want to be out of step with our culture?
[2201.08 --> 2205.08]  Some fashions don't matter.
[2205.08 --> 2206.08]  Right?
[2206.08 --> 2209.08]  And we can just look like everyone else around us in our culture.
[2209.08 --> 2210.08]  It's no big deal.
[2210.08 --> 2211.08]  I can wear black jeans.
[2211.08 --> 2220.08]  But there are some things that are always to be part of Christian communities culture.
[2220.08 --> 2221.08]  Right?
[2221.08 --> 2226.08]  Wherever and whenever you find it, our very lives are to be sacrifices of worship to God.
[2226.08 --> 2232.08]  And this is to be true wherever Christians are found, no matter how they dress.
[2232.08 --> 2233.08]  Some things change.
[2233.08 --> 2235.08]  Some things don't.
[2235.08 --> 2242.08]  But what does living as a sacrifice of worship to God look like?
[2242.08 --> 2250.08]  See, we need the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to know the precise shape this should take.
[2250.08 --> 2254.08]  So Paul goes on to tell us some things that we have to give up.
[2254.08 --> 2256.08]  And there are three things that he lists here.
[2256.08 --> 2259.08]  He tells us in verse 3.
[2259.08 --> 2264.08]  He says, but among you there must not be even a hint.
[2264.08 --> 2270.08]  Even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed.
[2270.08 --> 2272.08]  Because these are not proper.
[2272.08 --> 2275.08]  These are improper for God's holy people.
[2275.08 --> 2281.08]  He tells them they have to put off sexual immorality and impurity and greed.
[2281.08 --> 2286.08]  The Ephesians knew they had to give up worshiping idols.
[2286.08 --> 2287.08]  If they're going to follow Jesus.
[2287.08 --> 2290.08]  They had learned that much already.
[2290.08 --> 2298.08]  But now Paul tells them that real idolatry remains among them if they tolerate sexual immorality, impurity, or greed.
[2298.08 --> 2300.08]  So that's what he says in verse 5.
[2300.08 --> 2307.08]  Verse 5 says, for of this you can be sure.
[2307.08 --> 2311.08]  No immoral, impure, or greed person.
[2311.08 --> 2315.08]  Such a person is an idolater.
[2315.08 --> 2320.08]  Has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[2320.08 --> 2322.08]  How are we to understand this?
[2322.08 --> 2336.08]  How is it that greed, sexual immorality, which is any sexual behavior outside of God's vision for marriage, how does that make us an idolater?
[2336.08 --> 2338.08]  Well, what is an idolater?
[2338.08 --> 2342.08]  An idolater is a person who worships a false God.
[2342.08 --> 2352.08]  See, the story of the Bible that we know is that we were made by God to find our fullness in God and to look for our life in Him.
[2352.08 --> 2354.08]  We were made to worship God.
[2354.08 --> 2366.08]  But when we rejected this life with God, what ends up happening is that we don't just reject God and then leave this void, but we try to actually fill it up.
[2366.08 --> 2368.08]  We replace God with these other things.
[2368.08 --> 2372.08]  We try to find fullness instead of in our life with God.
[2372.08 --> 2375.08]  We try to find fullness in something else instead.
[2375.08 --> 2379.08]  Now, let's just think about sex for a moment.
[2379.08 --> 2383.08]  Sex is a good gift that God has given us.
[2383.08 --> 2389.08]  Sexuality and sexual desire on their own are not evil or sinful.
[2389.08 --> 2398.08]  God created us as male and female and our sexuality is an expression of God's good design for us and His generosity to us.
[2398.08 --> 2410.08]  But sex, which God made good, becomes immoral when we look to it to take the place of God in our lives.
[2410.08 --> 2421.08]  We do this when we look for sex to fulfill a deep need in us for intimacy and love and acceptance and joy that we can only find in God.
[2421.08 --> 2431.08]  And we see sex as this earthly thing that just for a moment can actually give us this experience and this glimpse of what we long for.
[2431.08 --> 2438.08]  But sex was not designed to fulfill that need that we all have to be truly loved and accepted as we are by God.
[2438.08 --> 2447.08]  So in a sense, any kind of sexual immorality is actually just overvaluing the gift of sex by trusting in it too much.
[2447.08 --> 2450.08]  We try to elevate it to the place of God in our lives.
[2450.08 --> 2452.08]  That's what the Bible calls idolatry.
[2452.08 --> 2455.08]  Putting something else in the place of God in our hearts.
[2455.08 --> 2464.08]  So instead of our hearts finding their fullness and satisfaction in God alone, we seek to fill our hearts with these other things.
[2464.08 --> 2468.08]  But here's the other part of this that's even so sad, I think.
[2468.08 --> 2481.08]  That in the act of idolizing something and taking that thing out of its God-given purpose, what happens is that it fails to satisfy all of our hopes for happiness and fulfillment.
[2481.08 --> 2484.08]  And what happens is we then despise it.
[2484.08 --> 2485.08]  Right?
[2485.08 --> 2488.08]  We set this thing up and we put all of our hopes in it.
[2488.08 --> 2490.08]  And it lets us down.
[2490.08 --> 2494.08]  And so we treat it as something trivial.
[2494.08 --> 2496.08]  As something common.
[2496.08 --> 2499.08]  As something not precious that God has given us.
[2499.08 --> 2502.08]  So there's this interplay.
[2502.08 --> 2505.08]  In one sense, we're putting too much hope in it.
[2505.08 --> 2510.08]  And in another sense, when it doesn't truly satisfy us, it becomes meaningless to us.
[2510.08 --> 2512.08]  And we joke about it.
[2512.08 --> 2514.08]  What Paul calls is crude joking.
[2514.08 --> 2518.08]  Instead of it being something holy and beautiful from God.
[2518.08 --> 2523.08]  This is the pattern of every form of idolatry.
[2523.08 --> 2526.08]  Our use of God's good gifts is broken.
[2526.08 --> 2529.08]  And it ends up breaking us.
[2529.08 --> 2532.08]  And it's essentially worshiping a false god.
[2532.08 --> 2535.08]  And that's why in verse 6, Paul says,
[2535.08 --> 2539.08]  For because of such things, God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
[2539.08 --> 2541.08]  Therefore, do not be partners with them.
[2541.08 --> 2553.08]  Now, in the next paragraph in our passage that we have this morning, Paul tells us, instead, he says, you know, put off sexual immorality and greed and impurity.
[2553.08 --> 2556.08]  Don't even hint.
[2556.08 --> 2558.08]  Those things shouldn't have a hint among us.
[2558.08 --> 2560.08]  We should not be partners with them.
[2560.08 --> 2564.08]  But instead, in the next paragraph, there's some things we need to put on.
[2564.08 --> 2567.08]  To walk in the way of love and the example of Christ.
[2567.08 --> 2570.08]  And he says something absolutely amazing here.
[2570.08 --> 2572.08]  In verse 8, he says,
[2572.08 --> 2580.08]  For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[2580.08 --> 2582.08]  Live as children of light.
[2582.08 --> 2587.08]  He says, you were darkness, and now you are light.
[2587.08 --> 2588.08]  Right?
[2588.08 --> 2592.08]  He's not saying you just, you were in the light, now that God has saved you.
[2592.08 --> 2594.08]  He says, you are light.
[2594.08 --> 2596.08]  You have become light yourselves.
[2596.08 --> 2597.08]  Right?
[2597.08 --> 2599.08]  Jesus said to his disciples, what did he say?
[2599.08 --> 2602.08]  I am the light of the world.
[2602.08 --> 2603.08]  Right?
[2603.08 --> 2604.08]  Jesus is the light of the world.
[2604.08 --> 2608.08]  Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[2608.08 --> 2609.08]  Right?
[2609.08 --> 2613.08]  Jesus came into our dark world.
[2613.08 --> 2616.08]  He's shown his light into our hearts.
[2616.08 --> 2618.08]  And his light is always with us.
[2618.08 --> 2619.08]  Right?
[2619.08 --> 2620.08]  That's a wonderful promise.
[2620.08 --> 2626.08]  But what is really amazing is that then Jesus tells his disciples in the Sermon on the Mount,
[2626.08 --> 2629.08]  You are the light of the world.
[2629.08 --> 2631.08]  Right?
[2631.08 --> 2633.08]  Earlier he said, I am the light of the world.
[2633.08 --> 2638.08]  And then he says, you are the light of the world.
[2638.08 --> 2639.08]  Right?
[2639.08 --> 2642.08]  This is the change that happens when you become a follower of Christ.
[2642.08 --> 2646.08]  Not only does God's light shine upon you, but you are transformed.
[2646.08 --> 2648.08]  You become light yourself.
[2648.08 --> 2650.08]  And Paul says, you've got to remember who you are.
[2650.08 --> 2652.08]  You were once darkness.
[2652.08 --> 2654.08]  Now you are light in the Lord.
[2654.08 --> 2656.08]  You have this new identity, this new nature.
[2656.08 --> 2663.08]  And so, since your very nature and identity has been radically changed, your lifestyle should reflect that.
[2663.08 --> 2667.08]  So he says now, live as children of light.
[2667.08 --> 2672.08]  Live in a way that corresponds to who you are.
[2672.08 --> 2678.08]  And so in the rest of the passage, Paul talks about what it looks like to live as children of light.
[2678.08 --> 2685.08]  So just there's three things I want to point out here about how to live as the light in the world.
[2685.08 --> 2688.08]  So the first one is that light bears fruit.
[2688.08 --> 2689.08]  Light bears fruit.
[2689.08 --> 2691.08]  So we see this in verse 9.
[2691.08 --> 2698.08]  He says, for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
[2698.08 --> 2701.08]  How many of you like to garden?
[2701.08 --> 2703.08]  I know a couple.
[2703.08 --> 2707.08]  We used to have a little plot in our backyard and then we just let it go to seed.
[2707.08 --> 2710.08]  It's like our lettuce is this tall plant now.
[2710.08 --> 2711.08]  It's like branching out.
[2711.08 --> 2712.08]  It's very interesting.
[2712.08 --> 2714.08]  I didn't know lettuce could do that.
[2714.08 --> 2717.08]  We've left it for a couple of years.
[2717.08 --> 2724.08]  But now when the sun rises over the garden, it doesn't just make it possible to see the garden.
[2724.08 --> 2727.08]  The light affects change in the garden.
[2727.08 --> 2729.08]  It causes plants to grow.
[2729.08 --> 2733.08]  They reach maturity and they bear fruit.
[2733.08 --> 2740.08]  In the same way, when Christ shines his light on you, it brings about fruitfulness.
[2740.08 --> 2741.08]  Right?
[2741.08 --> 2744.08]  It produces a harvest of goodness and righteousness and truth.
[2744.08 --> 2745.08]  Right?
[2745.08 --> 2750.08]  And these are things that actually reflect the character of God himself.
[2750.08 --> 2752.08]  They're the fruit of light.
[2752.08 --> 2757.08]  And as we follow the example of Christ, these fruits start to grow in us as well.
[2757.08 --> 2760.08]  We live as the light and we bear this fruit.
[2760.08 --> 2762.08]  So that's the first thing.
[2762.08 --> 2765.08]  Second, Paul next says in verse 10,
[2765.08 --> 2770.08]  And find out what pleases the Lord.
[2770.08 --> 2775.08]  See, following the example of Christ means that we want to please the Lord.
[2775.08 --> 2786.08]  Jesus said, I have come down from heaven not to do my own will, but to do the will of him who sent me.
[2786.08 --> 2790.08]  I like to think about a young child, maybe a toddler.
[2790.08 --> 2795.08]  They're playing with Lego or they're drawing a picture or they're painting something.
[2795.08 --> 2797.08]  And they pour themselves into it.
[2797.08 --> 2798.08]  Right?
[2798.08 --> 2799.08]  They're intense.
[2799.08 --> 2803.08]  They're making this thing until something else grabs their attention.
[2803.08 --> 2809.08]  But before they kind of leave what they're doing and they go on to something else, they often do one thing, don't they?
[2809.08 --> 2813.08]  They proudly take what they've made and they bring it to a parent.
[2813.08 --> 2817.08]  And they show it with this great excitement and they say, look what I made.
[2817.08 --> 2824.08]  And then there's this universal reaction from the parents where we say, wow, that's wonderful.
[2824.08 --> 2826.08]  What is it?
[2826.08 --> 2827.08]  What is it?
[2827.08 --> 2832.08]  And I've learned actually you're supposed to say, tell me about it, which is a nicer way.
[2832.08 --> 2835.08]  But I used to say, what is it?
[2835.08 --> 2839.08]  And they point out, well, this blob thing is daddy.
[2839.08 --> 2841.08]  That's usually the way it goes.
[2841.08 --> 2848.08]  But whatever it is, you know, they pour themselves into it and they bring it to the parent to share in the parent's delight.
[2848.08 --> 2855.08]  And in the same way, to walk as children of light means we want to bear fruit that's pleasing to our heavenly father.
[2855.08 --> 2856.08]  And we bring it to him.
[2856.08 --> 2859.08]  We want to share in the delight of our heavenly father.
[2859.08 --> 2862.08]  Sometimes the things we produce, though, look like dark blobs.
[2862.08 --> 2864.08]  But it doesn't matter.
[2864.08 --> 2868.08]  Because when you bear fruit to please God, he is pleased with it.
[2868.08 --> 2871.08]  Because you are his child.
[2871.08 --> 2876.08]  Lastly, verse 11 says,
[2876.08 --> 2883.08]  Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
[2883.08 --> 2887.08]  See, darkness keeps things hidden in secret.
[2887.08 --> 2890.08]  But light brings them out.
[2890.08 --> 2892.08]  Light exposes things.
[2892.08 --> 2898.08]  And this is what happens when God's holy people walk in the way of love in the example of Christ.
[2898.08 --> 2904.08]  We offer a distinct picture to the world of what is good and true and beautiful.
[2904.08 --> 2911.08]  We don't expose darkness by standing up on our holy hill and shouting down at people.
[2911.08 --> 2913.08]  How do we expose darkness?
[2913.08 --> 2916.08]  We offer a different image.
[2916.08 --> 2922.08]  So, I read once about the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.
[2922.08 --> 2927.08]  The president of the Czech Republic is Vaclav Havel.
[2927.08 --> 2929.08]  He was an artist.
[2929.08 --> 2930.08]  He was a playwright.
[2930.08 --> 2942.08]  And he was once asked why the Velvet Revolution against the Communist government in the former Czechoslovakia was so successfully non-violent.
[2942.08 --> 2945.08]  Here's how Havel answered.
[2945.08 --> 2946.08]  He said,
[2946.08 --> 2950.08]  We had our parallel society.
[2950.08 --> 2966.08]  And in that parallel society, we wrote our plays and sang our songs and read our poems until we knew the truth so well that we could go out in the streets of Prague and say,
[2966.08 --> 2969.08]  We don't believe your lies anymore.
[2969.08 --> 2971.08]  And he said,
[2971.08 --> 2974.08]  Communism had a fall.
[2974.08 --> 2976.08]  And this is what our church is to do as well.
[2976.08 --> 2977.08]  Right?
[2977.08 --> 2987.08]  We're called to be a parallel society in the world, strengthened by holy words and corporate songs,
[2987.08 --> 2994.08]  so that we know the truth and we don't follow the fashions of our culture, but instead we follow the example of Christ.
[2994.08 --> 2998.08]  We reflect Christ in our day in our culture.
[2998.08 --> 3000.08]  The glory is not ours.
[3001.08 --> 3002.08]  It is God's.
[3003.08 --> 3006.08]  But people have to see it through us.
[3007.08 --> 3012.08]  You know, one of the things about cultural fashions is that it makes it easy to know what to do.
[3012.08 --> 3013.08]  Right?
[3013.08 --> 3015.08]  It makes it easy to know what to do.
[3015.08 --> 3016.08]  We follow the fashions.
[3016.08 --> 3020.08]  I didn't think very hard about what clothes to put on this morning.
[3020.08 --> 3022.08]  Some of you are going,
[3022.08 --> 3023.08]  Yeah.
[3023.08 --> 3025.08]  Quite obviously.
[3025.08 --> 3028.08]  But we do just what fits in.
[3028.08 --> 3030.08]  We do whatever everybody else is doing.
[3030.08 --> 3031.08]  Right?
[3031.08 --> 3032.08]  We sound like them.
[3032.08 --> 3034.08]  We dress like them.
[3034.08 --> 3036.08]  We believe like them.
[3036.08 --> 3037.08]  It's easy.
[3037.08 --> 3042.08]  But when a Christian community figures out how to fit in its surrounding culture,
[3042.08 --> 3045.08]  there are these two mistakes that we make.
[3045.08 --> 3048.08]  And so what I mean is we do have to live here.
[3048.08 --> 3049.08]  Right?
[3049.08 --> 3050.08]  We don't live somewhere else.
[3050.08 --> 3051.08]  We live here.
[3052.08 --> 3058.08]  But wherever we live as God's people, there are two mistakes that we can make.
[3058.08 --> 3063.08]  The first mistake is to make something important that isn't.
[3063.08 --> 3067.08]  There's something not very important, but we make it important.
[3067.08 --> 3068.08]  Here's an example.
[3068.08 --> 3073.08]  On the East Coast in Pennsylvania, there's a Christian community called the Amish.
[3073.08 --> 3078.08]  They have made the horse and buggy too important.
[3078.08 --> 3088.08]  I could never become Amish because that is too strong of a fashion for acceptance into their Christian community.
[3088.08 --> 3089.08]  We do the same thing.
[3089.08 --> 3099.08]  Sometimes we make the way we speak or our dress or our style or our political cause or something else that's not the gospel too important.
[3099.08 --> 3105.08]  And as a result, others in our community can't become Christian.
[3105.08 --> 3107.08]  It is too hard of a barrier.
[3107.08 --> 3109.08]  So we do that sometimes.
[3109.08 --> 3111.08]  We make something important that isn't.
[3111.08 --> 3114.08]  So that's the first mistake.
[3114.08 --> 3117.08]  And that isolates the church from the surrounding culture.
[3117.08 --> 3121.08]  The second mistake, though, is, in my opinion, worse.
[3121.08 --> 3129.08]  And that is for the church to accept things as normal from the surrounding culture that Christ in the way of love actually abhors.
[3129.08 --> 3131.08]  I'll say it again.
[3131.08 --> 3135.08]  The second mistake is for the church to accept things as normal from the surrounding culture.
[3135.08 --> 3138.08]  Like, hey, this is just what we do here.
[3138.08 --> 3146.08]  To accept that as normal for ourselves that Christ in the way of love actually abhors.
[3146.08 --> 3152.08]  Church history is full of the church swallowing things in its surrounding culture that it should not have.
[3152.08 --> 3160.08]  Instead of being a parallel society, it becomes just like everyone else in the wrong ways.
[3160.08 --> 3166.08]  So what are we accepting as 21st century Canadians as just the normal status quo?
[3166.08 --> 3169.08]  Well, that's what everyone else believes.
[3169.08 --> 3172.08]  But that God our Father actually really cannot tolerate.
[3172.08 --> 3178.08]  We can list a lot of things and you wouldn't want to hear them.
[3178.08 --> 3181.08]  But I'll give you one example.
[3181.08 --> 3195.08]  That it is normal that I treat people who are physically attractive, whether they're men or women, just physically attractive people, I treat them better than people who are not physically attractive.
[3195.08 --> 3196.08]  Right?
[3196.08 --> 3198.08]  God hates that.
[3198.08 --> 3200.08]  So I have to stop.
[3200.08 --> 3202.08]  I've got to change.
[3202.08 --> 3203.08]  Is it easy?
[3203.08 --> 3204.08]  No.
[3204.08 --> 3205.08]  It is hard.
[3205.08 --> 3207.08]  But is it glorious?
[3207.08 --> 3208.08]  Yes.
[3208.08 --> 3211.08]  It is like Jesus.
[3211.08 --> 3216.08]  You cannot just do what comes naturally to you.
[3216.08 --> 3217.08]  Right?
[3217.08 --> 3221.08]  Not necessarily to our sinful hearts or to our sinful culture.
[3221.08 --> 3223.08]  The Ephesians couldn't do that.
[3223.08 --> 3227.08]  And Paul says also to us, you can't do that anymore.
[3228.08 --> 3233.08]  Following the example of Christ is rarely doing what seems normal in any setting.
[3233.08 --> 3236.08]  It wasn't even in his setting.
[3237.08 --> 3242.08]  We have to work at learning what the Lord's will is so we can imitate him.
[3242.08 --> 3249.08]  That's true of us as individual Christians, and it is true of us as a church.
[3249.08 --> 3252.08]  Let me pray for us.
[3256.08 --> 3261.08]  Heavenly Father, you have called us out of darkness into your marvelous light.
[3261.08 --> 3264.08]  Lord, that is by your mercy and your grace.
[3264.08 --> 3268.08]  Not because of anything that we have done or could do.
[3268.08 --> 3271.08]  No goodness or righteousness on our part.
[3271.08 --> 3278.08]  But Lord, in calling us to be your children, you also give us your good law.
[3278.08 --> 3281.08]  You want us to live in your own light and purity.
[3281.08 --> 3284.08]  And so, Lord, you change us.
[3286.08 --> 3287.08]  And it's not easy.
[3287.08 --> 3291.08]  We don't know sometimes what it is we should follow.
[3292.08 --> 3294.08]  Lord, we get confused so often.
[3294.08 --> 3305.08]  But Lord, would you reveal to us, your people, through your word, how you want us to live as a parallel society to reflect the glory of God.
[3306.08 --> 3307.08]  Lord, would you help us?
[3307.08 --> 3309.08]  Would you do your work in us?
[3309.08 --> 3313.08]  Even when it's hard, would we remember that we are your beloved?
[3313.08 --> 3317.08]  And that we have this joy that we can do.
[3317.08 --> 3318.08]  We can do what you call us to do.
[3318.08 --> 3320.08]  We ask for your help in Jesus' name.
[3320.08 --> 3321.08]  Amen.
[3323.08 --> 3325.08]  So, would you please stand?
[3325.08 --> 3326.08]  We'll sing our song of response.
[3326.08 --> 3327.08]  We are a people on a journey.
[3327.08 --> 3328.08]  We are people on a journey.
[3328.08 --> 3329.08]  We are people on a journey.
[3329.08 --> 3330.08]  Falling with a master floor.
[3330.08 --> 3332.08]  We are people on a journey.
[3332.08 --> 3334.08]  Falling with a master floor.
[3334.08 --> 3335.08]  We are people on a journey.
[3335.08 --> 3353.02]  We are people on a journey
[3353.02 --> 3359.38]  Falling where the Master was
[3359.38 --> 3364.94]  We are people on a journey
[3364.94 --> 3371.38]  In the shadow of the cross
[3371.38 --> 3376.64]  In the palace, the place of Jesus
[3376.64 --> 3383.30]  In the touch, the faithful God
[3383.30 --> 3389.64]  We tread the road of service
[3389.64 --> 3396.08]  As the Lord the crucifix
[3396.08 --> 3404.52]  We are people on a journey
[3404.52 --> 3410.96]  Taking up the cross of Christ
[3410.96 --> 3416.08]  We are people on a journey
[3416.08 --> 3422.96]  Moving on from death to death
[3422.96 --> 3429.40]  We release the sin that takes us
[3429.40 --> 3434.40]  We breathe in which all are clean
[3434.40 --> 3440.40]  We receive the suffering Savior
[3440.40 --> 3454.84]  We are people on a journey
[3454.84 --> 3461.28]  Rising up in life and life
[3461.28 --> 3466.80]  We are people on a journey
[3466.80 --> 3472.28]  Speaking peace, attempting scorn
[3472.28 --> 3474.72]  We are people on a journey
[3474.72 --> 3476.72]  We are people on a journey
[3476.72 --> 3478.72]  We are people on a journey
[3478.72 --> 3479.72]  We are people on a journey
[3479.72 --> 3483.72]  To a mystery yet unknown
[3483.72 --> 3490.62]  To a kingdom coming quickly
[3490.62 --> 3496.06]  To the light of God's throne
[3496.06 --> 3502.50]  We are people on a journey
[3502.50 --> 3512.94]  We are people on a journey
[3512.94 --> 3514.94]  To a kingdom come to death
[3514.94 --> 3516.86]  It is time for our offering
[3516.86 --> 3518.78]  And our offering this morning
[3518.78 --> 3521.36]  Is for ABBA Canada
[3521.36 --> 3522.90]  And this is an organization
[3522.90 --> 3524.76]  Not a rock group I'm told
[3524.76 --> 3526.86]  It's an actual ABBA
[3526.86 --> 3528.54]  ABBA Canada
[3528.54 --> 3530.30]  And they are an organization
[3530.30 --> 3532.36]  Dedicated to providing
[3532.36 --> 3533.84]  Financial assistance
[3533.84 --> 3535.42]  To Christian families
[3535.42 --> 3537.94]  That feel led to adopt children
[3537.94 --> 3539.44]  Either locally or internationally
[3539.44 --> 3540.94]  And there are considerable costs
[3540.94 --> 3541.72]  Associated with that
[3541.72 --> 3543.88]  So this is a good cause to donate to
[3543.88 --> 3545.24]  We'll take your offerings at this time
[3558.54 --> 3587.60]  Listen to the
[3587.60 --> 3617.58]  Thank you.
[3617.60 --> 3647.58]  Thank you.
[3647.60 --> 3649.60]  Thank you.
[3649.60 --> 3651.60]  Thank you.
[3651.60 --> 3653.60]  Thank you.
[3653.60 --> 3654.60]  Thank you.
[3654.60 --> 3655.60]  Thank you.
[3655.60 --> 3657.60]  Thank you.
[3658.60 --> 3662.60]  Thank you.
[3662.60 --> 3663.60]  Thank you.
[3663.60 --> 3664.60]  Thank you.
[3664.60 --> 3665.60]  Thank you.
[3665.60 --> 3671.60]  Before we come together in prayer, just one note that did not make it in the bulletin,
[3671.60 --> 3678.60]  and that is that Scott Van Dopp is in hospital with a recurrence, I believe it is, of an infection
[3678.60 --> 3679.60]  in his leg.
[3679.60 --> 3686.60]  It is quite severe, so we want to keep Scott and Lee and the kids in our prayers.
[3686.60 --> 3688.60]  Please join me in prayer.
[3688.60 --> 3689.60]  Thank you.
[3689.60 --> 3690.60]  Thank you.
[3690.60 --> 3691.60]  Thank you.
[3691.60 --> 3692.60]  Thank you.
[3692.60 --> 3693.60]  Thank you.
[3693.60 --> 3694.60]  Thank you.
[3694.60 --> 3695.60]  Thank you.
[3695.60 --> 3696.60]  Thank you.
[3696.60 --> 3697.60]  Thank you, Lord.
[3697.60 --> 3698.60]  Thank you, Lord.
[3698.60 --> 3699.60]  Thank you.
[3699.60 --> 3700.60]  Thank you, Lord.
[3700.60 --> 3701.60]  Thank you.
[3701.60 --> 3712.60]  Thank you for the great mercies you show forth to us day by day, food, clothing, shelter,
[3712.60 --> 3714.60]  family and work and rest.
[3714.60 --> 3720.58]  Of all that you have blessed us with, the greatest is that you have given your Son for us and given us to him.
[3721.36 --> 3728.00]  We thank you for the salvation brought through the atoning sacrifice and glorious ascension of Jesus Christ
[3728.00 --> 3732.24]  and the benefits that are ours in adoption as your children in him.
[3733.50 --> 3738.74]  We pray for others, God our Savior, claiming your love in Jesus Christ for the whole world
[3738.74 --> 3742.40]  and committing ourselves to care for those around us in his name.
[3743.16 --> 3747.78]  We especially pray for those feeling lonely or disconnected within our own church community.
[3748.70 --> 3753.92]  Help us be intentional in reaching out and building relationships with those around us
[3753.92 --> 3758.16]  so that we can be of help to each other whenever and wherever needed.
[3759.26 --> 3762.00]  We pray for those suffering from sickness or injury.
[3762.88 --> 3763.56]  Please be near Quinn.
