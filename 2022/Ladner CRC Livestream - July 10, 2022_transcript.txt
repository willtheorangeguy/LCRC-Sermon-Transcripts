[296.04 --> 314.04]  Good morning.
[317.04 --> 323.54]  Welcome to all of you that are here in person and those of you who may be joining us by
[323.54 --> 324.30]  live stream.
[325.06 --> 328.96]  My name is John Banstra and I will be leading our service this morning.
[329.88 --> 336.40]  A special welcome to all of those who are visiting with us and I'd like to invite you
[336.40 --> 343.22]  after our service we have a time of refreshments straight back in the fellowship room and we
[343.22 --> 345.46]  love to get to know you if you are a visitor.
[345.46 --> 346.72]  You can get to know us.
[347.50 --> 350.86]  Also a special welcome to Todd Statham right here.
[351.80 --> 358.76]  Todd is the last two times he preached he was on Zoom so now we know he's an actual person.
[359.82 --> 368.96]  He's come to join us and he is from he's the UBC Horkenagan chaplain for the Christian Reformed
[368.96 --> 370.44]  church in Kelowna.
[370.78 --> 371.60]  So welcome Todd.
[372.42 --> 377.50]  And you'll hear more about his ministry during his sermon.
[378.24 --> 380.70]  Could I ask you to rise please for those who are able?
[380.70 --> 385.84]  Our call to worship is from Psalm 100.
[387.46 --> 389.94]  Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth.
[390.42 --> 392.02]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[392.48 --> 394.56]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[395.12 --> 396.60]  Know that the Lord is God.
[396.60 --> 399.48]  It is he who made us and we are his.
[399.78 --> 400.82]  We are his people.
[401.42 --> 402.62]  The sheep of his pasture.
[403.62 --> 407.04]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[407.98 --> 410.44]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[410.74 --> 413.42]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[414.08 --> 417.32]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[417.32 --> 422.56]  Now we're going to sing as a deer.
[426.46 --> 428.22]  Actually before we do that I would just
[428.22 --> 429.74]  we've got
[429.74 --> 431.82]  no that's afterwards sorry.
[432.52 --> 432.98]  Carry on.
[432.98 --> 435.86]  All right.
[447.32 --> 456.46]  As the deer bends on the water so much so long I've had to you.
[458.28 --> 467.58]  You alone are my lost desire and I long to worship you.
[468.58 --> 474.34]  You alone are my strength my shield.
[474.34 --> 480.04]  To you alone may my spirit be.
[481.82 --> 491.52]  You alone are my Lord's desire and I long to worship you.
[493.92 --> 502.90]  You are my friend and you are my brother's even though you are a king.
[504.34 --> 513.32]  I love you more than any other so much more than anything.
[515.32 --> 520.72]  You alone are my strength my shield.
[520.72 --> 526.82]  To you alone may my spirit be.
[526.82 --> 530.44]  You alone are my heart I'll for you.
[543.18 --> 547.52]  Oh, Lord, that's all dear.
[547.52 --> 549.98]  is mine
[549.98 --> 553.40]  you alone
[553.40 --> 554.22]  are the
[554.22 --> 556.10]  joy giver
[556.10 --> 556.88]  and the
[556.88 --> 557.88]  apple
[557.88 --> 559.64]  of my
[559.64 --> 560.88]  eye
[560.88 --> 563.88]  you alone
[563.88 --> 565.14]  are my
[565.14 --> 565.84]  strength
[565.84 --> 567.36]  my shield
[567.36 --> 568.84]  to you
[568.84 --> 569.88]  alone
[569.88 --> 570.94]  be my
[570.94 --> 571.76]  spirit
[571.76 --> 573.02]  dear
[573.02 --> 575.94]  you
[575.94 --> 577.46]  alone
[577.46 --> 578.30]  are my
[578.30 --> 579.40]  heart's
[579.40 --> 580.30]  desire
[580.30 --> 581.12]  and I
[581.12 --> 581.96]  long
[581.96 --> 582.74]  to
[582.74 --> 584.08]  worship
[584.08 --> 584.88]  you
[584.88 --> 597.00]  God's
[597.00 --> 597.24]  greeting
[597.24 --> 597.82]  comes to us
[597.82 --> 598.22]  this morning
[598.22 --> 599.06]  from Revelation
[599.06 --> 599.60]  1
[599.60 --> 601.08]  grace to
[601.08 --> 601.48]  you and
[601.48 --> 602.08]  peace from
[602.08 --> 602.44]  him who
[602.44 --> 603.28]  is and
[603.28 --> 603.78]  who was
[603.78 --> 604.06]  and who
[604.06 --> 604.38]  is to
[604.38 --> 604.72]  come
[604.72 --> 605.72]  and from
[605.72 --> 606.18]  the seven
[606.18 --> 606.90]  spirits who
[606.90 --> 607.32]  are before
[607.32 --> 607.92]  his throne
[607.92 --> 608.90]  and from
[608.90 --> 609.72]  Jesus Christ
[609.72 --> 610.32]  the faithful
[610.32 --> 610.86]  witness
[610.86 --> 612.24]  the firstborn
[612.24 --> 612.90]  of the dead
[612.90 --> 613.88]  and the ruler
[613.88 --> 615.02]  of the kings
[615.02 --> 615.72]  of the earth
[615.72 --> 616.82]  now as God
[616.82 --> 617.52]  has greeted us
[617.52 --> 617.98]  let's just
[617.98 --> 619.10]  take our time
[619.10 --> 620.20]  to greet each
[620.20 --> 620.54]  other
[620.54 --> 621.64]  those around
[621.64 --> 621.90]  you
[621.90 --> 635.30]  we
[635.30 --> 646.14]  so at this point
[646.14 --> 646.92]  we were to have
[646.92 --> 653.50]  the children from the kids camp singing now, but unfortunately the kids couldn't make it.
[654.00 --> 656.26]  So we're going to go right into our song.
[657.56 --> 659.14]  The praise team is going to lead us.
[660.46 --> 663.22]  And then we'll just have the one song.
[663.22 --> 663.64]  All right.
[665.76 --> 666.28]  All right.
[666.28 --> 668.10]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[668.10 --> 679.02]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[680.52 --> 683.98]  Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[685.58 --> 689.40]  I'm so glad you're in my life.
[690.96 --> 695.34]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[695.34 --> 701.40]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[701.80 --> 706.70]  From the earth to the cross, I dare to pay.
[707.10 --> 712.18]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sun.
[712.54 --> 715.94]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[718.04 --> 721.34]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[721.34 --> 726.34]  Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[726.34 --> 731.34]  I'm so glad you're in my life.
[733.34 --> 737.34]  I'm so glad you came to save us.
[737.34 --> 742.34]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[742.34 --> 747.34]  From the earth to the cross, I dare to pay.
[747.34 --> 754.34]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky.
[754.34 --> 759.34]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[759.34 --> 760.34]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[760.34 --> 765.76]  You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[765.76 --> 771.28]  From the earth to the cross, I dare to pay.
[771.28 --> 776.78]  From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky.
[777.14 --> 779.94]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[779.94 --> 782.50]  Lord, I lift your name on high.
[782.50 --> 785.94]  Let's sing your praises.
[791.94 --> 796.22]  At this point, the children ages 3 through grade 4 are dismissed for kids' life.
[796.22 --> 799.76]  and we bless them on their way to their class.
[808.86 --> 811.20]  At this point, we're going to have our confession,
[812.26 --> 813.24]  prayer of confession.
[826.22 --> 828.94]  Is that going to be projected?
[832.30 --> 833.22]  There we go.
[834.26 --> 835.16]  Prayer of confession.
[835.86 --> 839.74]  So as usual, the two little arrows, that's the congregation.
[840.64 --> 843.70]  Most merciful God, whose Son, Jesus Christ,
[843.78 --> 846.84]  was tempted in every way, yet was without sin.
[847.38 --> 850.88]  We confess before you our own sinfulness.
[852.04 --> 855.44]  We have hungered after that which does not satisfy.
[856.22 --> 858.66]  We have compromised with evil.
[859.70 --> 862.68]  We have doubted your power to protect us.
[863.52 --> 865.16]  Forgive our lack of faith.
[865.68 --> 867.58]  Have mercy on our weakness.
[868.94 --> 872.82]  Restore in us such trust and love that we may walk in your ways
[872.82 --> 874.80]  and delight in doing your will.
[877.32 --> 883.36]  And now our assurance of pardon, which is taken from Psalm 103, 8-13.
[884.26 --> 886.16]  The Lord is merciful and gracious.
[886.22 --> 889.62]  Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
[889.62 --> 902.24]  He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
[902.60 --> 906.12]  For as the heavens are high above the earth,
[906.12 --> 911.08]  so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him.
[912.08 --> 917.92]  As far as the east is from the west, so far he removes our transgressions from us.
[917.92 --> 926.00]  As far as the Lord has compassion for his children, so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him.
[927.88 --> 930.12]  At this point, we'll sing of that assurance.
[932.32 --> 933.06]  Faithful one.
[933.06 --> 936.06]  Faithful one.
[936.06 --> 938.06]  So unchanging.
[938.06 --> 940.06]  Faithful one.
[940.06 --> 942.06]  So unchanging.
[942.06 --> 943.06]  Faithful one.
[943.06 --> 944.06]  So unchanging.
[944.06 --> 945.06]  Faithful one.
[945.06 --> 946.06]  So unchanging.
[946.06 --> 947.06]  Faithful one.
[947.06 --> 949.06]  Faithful one.
[949.06 --> 950.06]  So unchanging.
[950.06 --> 951.06]  Faithful one.
[951.06 --> 952.06]  So unchanging.
[952.06 --> 953.06]  Faithful one.
[953.06 --> 954.06]  Faithful one.
[954.06 --> 956.06]  So unchanging.
[956.06 --> 958.06]  Faithful one.
[958.06 --> 959.06]  So unchanging.
[959.06 --> 961.06]  Faithful one.
[961.06 --> 962.06]  So unchanging.
[962.06 --> 963.06]  So unchanging.
[963.06 --> 964.06]  So unchanging.
[964.06 --> 965.06]  So unchanging.
[965.06 --> 966.06]  So unchanging.
[966.06 --> 968.06]  So unchanging.
[968.06 --> 969.06]  Anxious one.
[969.06 --> 970.06]  You're my one of peace.
[970.06 --> 971.06]  Anxious one.
[971.06 --> 972.06]  You're my one of peace.
[972.06 --> 973.06]  Born of all.
[973.06 --> 974.06]  I depend on you.
[974.06 --> 975.06]  I call up to you.
[975.06 --> 976.06]  Again and again.
[976.06 --> 977.06]  My love to you.
[977.06 --> 979.06]  You're my one of peace.
[979.06 --> 980.06]  You're my one of peace.
[980.06 --> 981.06]  You're my one of peace.
[981.06 --> 984.06]  Born of all.
[984.06 --> 989.06]  I depend on you.
[989.06 --> 994.06]  I call up to you.
[994.06 --> 998.06]  I call up to you.
[998.06 --> 1003.06]  Again and again.
[1003.06 --> 1006.06]  I call up to you.
[1006.06 --> 1010.06]  Again and again.
[1010.06 --> 1016.06]  You are my rock.
[1016.06 --> 1022.06]  In times of trouble.
[1022.06 --> 1028.06]  You lift me up.
[1028.06 --> 1033.06]  When I fall down.
[1033.06 --> 1038.06]  All through the storm.
[1038.06 --> 1049.06]  Your love is the anchor.
[1049.06 --> 1059.06]  My love is in you alone.
[1059.06 --> 1065.06]  Faithful one.
[1065.06 --> 1070.06]  So unchanging.
[1070.06 --> 1071.06]  You are my one of peace.
[1071.06 --> 1072.06]  We call up to you.
[1072.06 --> 1074.06]  I call up to you.
[1074.06 --> 1075.06]  Yes.
[1075.06 --> 1076.06]  You are my one of peace.
[1076.06 --> 1079.06]  You are my one of peace.
[1079.06 --> 1080.06]  You are my one of peace.
[1080.06 --> 1085.06]  All of all.
[1085.06 --> 1091.06]  I depend on you.
[1094.20 --> 1103.06]  I call out to you again and again.
[1105.06 --> 1113.06]  I call out to you again and again.
[1115.06 --> 1124.06]  You are my bride in times of trouble.
[1126.06 --> 1135.06]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[1135.06 --> 1150.06]  All through the storm, your love is the anchor.
[1150.06 --> 1159.06]  My hope is in you alone.
[1159.06 --> 1189.06] 
[1189.06 --> 1195.06]  My hope is the anchor.
[1196.06 --> 1203.06]  My hope is in you alone.
[1203.06 --> 1215.06]  My hope is in you alone.
[1215.06 --> 1227.06]  My hope is in you alone.
[1227.06 --> 1233.06]  My hope is in you alone.
[1234.06 --> 1236.06]  Good morning, Ladner Church.
[1237.06 --> 1238.06]  Good morning.
[1238.06 --> 1243.06]  It is good to be here in person and not just on your screen, although some of you are watching me on your screen.
[1244.06 --> 1252.06]  But it's been a couple of years and I'm grateful for an opportunity to come down and preach and share a little bit about my work.
[1252.06 --> 1259.06]  And also, also just thank you for supporting the Christian Reformed Campus Ministry to the University of British Columbia.
[1260.06 --> 1261.06]  It's a campus in the Okanagan.
[1261.06 --> 1265.06]  I've been the campus pastor there for, I guess, I'm coming on six years now.
[1266.06 --> 1279.06]  And this is a strategic mission to the students and the professors and the staff at this university where we try to be a catalyst for thoughtful Christian engagement with university culture.
[1279.06 --> 1282.06]  And this is a strategic mission.
[1282.06 --> 1290.06]  It's a place where students are being formed and where some of the important ideas in our society are being formed.
[1290.06 --> 1297.06]  And this is wonderful to be part of a church denomination that wants the gospel on our university campuses.
[1298.06 --> 1301.06]  Helping students, helping young people grow in faith.
[1301.06 --> 1303.06]  Sometimes helping them keep faith.
[1303.06 --> 1310.06]  And also being a pastor and an encourager to professors who are Christians as well.
[1310.06 --> 1316.06]  So thank you for supporting this ministry through your classical shares and also through taking offerings.
[1316.06 --> 1322.06]  And if you ever want to talk more about what I do, what I'm up to, please send me an email or text me.
[1323.06 --> 1329.06]  I don't have my card with me today, but Pastor Jason or Bev and John Bannster have my contact information.
[1329.06 --> 1334.06]  And a couple of times a year, I try to send an update out and I hope it finds its way into your church mailboxes.
[1335.06 --> 1338.06]  If it doesn't, I'll mention that to Pastor Jason.
[1338.06 --> 1340.06]  But thank you again for having me this morning.
[1340.06 --> 1342.06]  And it's a pleasure to be here.
[1342.06 --> 1345.06]  I'm going to bring God's word today from Mark's gospel.
[1346.06 --> 1354.06]  I'm reading from Mark chapter 9, verses 14 to 29.
[1354.06 --> 1361.06]  Hear what the Holy Spirit has to say to this church this morning.
[1361.06 --> 1371.06]  When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
[1371.06 --> 1377.06]  As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
[1377.06 --> 1380.06]  What are you arguing with them about? He asked.
[1380.06 --> 1382.06]  A man in the crowd answered,
[1382.06 --> 1388.06]  Teacher, I brought you my son who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
[1388.06 --> 1392.06]  Whenever it seizes him, it throws him on the ground.
[1392.06 --> 1398.06]  He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid.
[1398.06 --> 1404.06]  I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.
[1404.06 --> 1409.06]  Oh, unbelieving generation, Jesus replied.
[1409.06 --> 1411.06]  How long shall I stay with you?
[1411.06 --> 1413.06]  How long shall I put up with you?
[1413.06 --> 1414.06]  Bring the boy to me.
[1414.06 --> 1416.06]  So they brought him.
[1416.06 --> 1420.06]  When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion.
[1420.06 --> 1424.06]  He fell to the ground and he rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
[1424.06 --> 1427.06]  Jesus asked the boy's father,
[1427.06 --> 1429.06]  How long has he been like this?
[1429.06 --> 1431.06]  From childhood, he answered.
[1431.06 --> 1436.06]  It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him.
[1436.06 --> 1443.06]  But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.
[1443.06 --> 1453.06]  If you can, said Jesus, everything is possible for him who believes.
[1453.06 --> 1456.06]  Immediately, the boy's father exclaimed,
[1456.06 --> 1459.06]  I do believe.
[1459.06 --> 1462.06]  Help me overcome my unbelief.
[1462.06 --> 1467.06]  When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit.
[1467.06 --> 1469.06]  You deaf and mute spirit, he said,
[1469.06 --> 1472.06]  I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.
[1472.06 --> 1476.06]  The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently, and came out.
[1476.06 --> 1479.06]  The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said,
[1479.06 --> 1480.06]  He's dead.
[1480.06 --> 1485.06]  But Jesus took him by the hand, lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
[1485.06 --> 1488.06]  After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately,
[1488.06 --> 1490.06]  Why couldn't we drive it out?
[1490.06 --> 1494.06]  He replied, This can only come out by prayer.
[1494.06 --> 1495.06]  Amen.
[1495.06 --> 1521.06]  May God add his blessing to the reading and to the proclamation of his word.
[1521.06 --> 1529.06]  The story from Mark's Gospel drops us right smack dab into the middle of a conflict.
[1529.06 --> 1531.06]  There's thick tension in the air.
[1531.06 --> 1534.06]  It hangs over the whole story.
[1534.06 --> 1536.06]  Jesus had been off stage.
[1536.06 --> 1541.06]  You can kind of imagine as the story starts, he comes back into the story,
[1541.06 --> 1543.06]  and the camera's following him.
[1543.06 --> 1544.06]  He's been away.
[1544.06 --> 1546.06]  He comes back into scene.
[1546.06 --> 1550.06]  Mark has us following him into this scene of tension, of turmoil.
[1550.06 --> 1555.06]  Jesus' followers are arguing with scribes and the whole crowd.
[1555.06 --> 1558.06]  It's a very uncomfortable story to be in.
[1558.06 --> 1560.06]  Don't walk out though.
[1560.06 --> 1562.06]  Something important's happening.
[1562.06 --> 1565.06]  What are you arguing about?
[1565.06 --> 1566.06]  Jesus asks.
[1566.06 --> 1568.06]  And a man in the crowd answers as we read.
[1568.06 --> 1570.06]  Teacher, I brought you my son.
[1570.06 --> 1573.06]  He's possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of his speech.
[1573.06 --> 1574.06]  It seizes him.
[1574.06 --> 1575.06]  It throws him to the ground.
[1575.06 --> 1576.06]  He gnashes his teeth.
[1576.06 --> 1578.06]  He foams at the mouth.
[1578.06 --> 1582.06]  I asked your disciples to drive out this spirit, but they couldn't do it.
[1582.06 --> 1588.06]  Ah, so there's tension in the air.
[1588.06 --> 1594.06]  Harsh words flying back and forth because of a problem.
[1594.06 --> 1598.06]  Indeed, because of failure.
[1598.06 --> 1604.06]  Jesus' disciples had been, had been on a roll.
[1604.06 --> 1606.06]  They were out and about.
[1606.06 --> 1608.06]  They were proclaiming the good news.
[1608.06 --> 1610.06]  They were, they were healing.
[1610.06 --> 1615.06]  They were driving out demons that were holding people down in despair and in death.
[1615.06 --> 1616.06]  There were crowds.
[1616.06 --> 1618.06]  There was success.
[1618.06 --> 1619.06]  There was momentum.
[1619.06 --> 1621.06]  They were on a roll.
[1621.06 --> 1623.06]  But now they fail.
[1623.06 --> 1624.06]  And they fail bad.
[1624.06 --> 1626.06]  In front of everybody.
[1626.06 --> 1632.06]  This poor father had brought his son to the disciples to be healed of a demon that had
[1632.06 --> 1635.06]  tormented this poor child since youth.
[1635.06 --> 1642.06]  I asked your disciples to drive this spirit out, he says, but they couldn't do it.
[1642.06 --> 1645.06]  Jesus' followers failed.
[1645.06 --> 1649.06]  And understandably, they're very disappointed.
[1649.06 --> 1657.06]  We all know that disappointment often lays seeds of doubt, right?
[1657.06 --> 1658.06]  Self-doubt.
[1658.06 --> 1663.06]  And doubt begins to grow like a weed.
[1663.06 --> 1667.06]  And it grows like a weed through this whole story.
[1667.06 --> 1672.06]  The disciples and the crowds are fighting because, you know, when you're disappointed
[1672.06 --> 1675.06]  and you're full of doubt, you get defensive, right?
[1675.06 --> 1679.06]  And then the crowds begin to doubt Jesus.
[1679.06 --> 1683.06]  So much so that Jesus gets exasperated and says, you know, how long do I have to put up
[1683.06 --> 1684.06]  with you guys?
[1684.06 --> 1685.06]  Come on.
[1685.06 --> 1692.06]  And then the boy's father, the boy's father, so full of disappointment, also can't get by
[1692.06 --> 1693.06]  his doubt.
[1693.06 --> 1702.06]  He says to Jesus, if you can do anything, take pity and help us.
[1702.06 --> 1703.06]  If.
[1703.06 --> 1709.06]  One of those enormous two-letter words.
[1709.06 --> 1717.06]  And then when Jesus drives out the demon, the crowd still doubt that the child is alive.
[1717.06 --> 1719.06]  I don't know if you caught that in the story.
[1719.06 --> 1721.06]  It's very subtle.
[1721.06 --> 1726.06]  Jesus drives out the demon and the crowd says, it looks like that kid's dead.
[1726.06 --> 1727.06]  A corpse.
[1727.06 --> 1736.06]  He says, it's a disappointment and doubt have, they seep throughout this story.
[1736.06 --> 1741.06]  Again, it's not a comfortable story for us to be in.
[1741.06 --> 1748.06]  I think, I think when we're honest with ourselves, some of us might realize that this isn't the
[1748.06 --> 1752.06]  kind of story we necessarily look at from the outside.
[1752.06 --> 1756.06]  We, some of us feel like we're kind of part of this story.
[1756.06 --> 1758.06]  Like we're in it.
[1758.06 --> 1762.06]  Jesus' disciples, like I said, they've been flying high.
[1762.06 --> 1763.06]  They were on a roll.
[1763.06 --> 1766.06]  And then things got hard and they failed.
[1769.06 --> 1771.06]  That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[1771.06 --> 1778.06]  Being on a roll, things get hard, we fail, doubt begins to creep in.
[1778.06 --> 1781.06]  Sounds familiar for me anyway.
[1781.06 --> 1782.06]  I don't know about you.
[1782.06 --> 1785.06]  Sounds like a bit of a pattern actually.
[1785.06 --> 1793.06]  Following Jesus, which for all of us begins when we're baptized, it can go easy for a while.
[1793.06 --> 1794.06]  Right?
[1794.06 --> 1799.06]  We can be on a roll, upward and onward, success.
[1799.06 --> 1804.06]  But at some point, it gets hard and we fail.
[1804.06 --> 1805.06]  We flop.
[1805.06 --> 1810.06]  Maybe we flop in front of everybody else too, just like the disciples did.
[1810.06 --> 1814.06]  Either way, at some point we mess up, we slip.
[1814.06 --> 1817.06]  And then disappointment creeps in.
[1817.06 --> 1820.06]  And with that, often doubt.
[1820.06 --> 1823.06]  Am I cut out for this?
[1823.06 --> 1826.06]  What if it happens again?
[1826.06 --> 1829.06]  Following Jesus is hard.
[1829.06 --> 1831.06]  Can I do it?
[1831.06 --> 1844.06]  Now I work with a demographic, 18 to 25, where this dynamic of disappointment and doubt is rampant.
[1844.06 --> 1846.06]  It's endemic.
[1846.06 --> 1848.06]  Now, of course, everyone's a little different.
[1848.06 --> 1851.06]  We all experience life differently.
[1851.06 --> 1857.06]  That moment we realize where life with Jesus isn't always a walk in the park.
[1857.06 --> 1860.06]  Sometimes it's a sojourn in the wilderness.
[1860.06 --> 1861.06]  Right?
[1861.06 --> 1867.06]  But for this age group, emerging adults, the kind of people we found on university campuses,
[1867.06 --> 1871.06]  this is a time when this realization often hits them hard.
[1871.06 --> 1876.06]  They leave the shelter of home and their family, their home church, and they face life on their own.
[1876.06 --> 1880.06]  And I hear this constantly from students, especially in their first and second year.
[1880.06 --> 1889.06]  Like, wow, I didn't realize it was so hard to be a Christian when I left home in this very secular environment.
[1889.06 --> 1892.06]  Disappointment happens.
[1892.06 --> 1895.06]  And then doubt follows.
[1895.06 --> 1899.06]  Maybe you had a similar experience if you went off to university or college.
[1899.06 --> 1901.06]  Or when you moved away from home.
[1901.06 --> 1905.06]  Maybe you're going through that right now.
[1905.06 --> 1913.06]  In fact, studies suggest that when people retire, it's often a moment when they begin to experience something of a spiritual crisis.
[1913.06 --> 1915.06]  They get reflective.
[1915.06 --> 1918.06]  Disappointment follows by doubt.
[1918.06 --> 1920.06]  We all fail.
[1920.06 --> 1921.06]  We all fail.
[1921.06 --> 1923.06]  And somehow we will all mess up.
[1923.06 --> 1926.06]  And we'll end up disappointed with ourselves.
[1926.06 --> 1927.06]  Disappointed with God.
[1927.06 --> 1930.06]  And then unbelief creeps in.
[1930.06 --> 1933.06]  Just like the father of this poor child.
[1933.06 --> 1937.06]  If you are able, he says.
[1937.06 --> 1939.06]  If you are able.
[1939.06 --> 1942.06]  We can't contain this doubt.
[1942.06 --> 1943.06]  Our doubt.
[1943.06 --> 1944.06]  Unbelief.
[1944.06 --> 1947.06]  Our doubts.
[1947.06 --> 1948.06]  Yeah.
[1948.06 --> 1949.06]  I've said it out loud.
[1949.06 --> 1951.06]  Some of you are looking indignant.
[1951.06 --> 1952.06]  What?
[1952.06 --> 1953.06]  Doubt?
[1953.06 --> 1954.06]  Me?
[1954.06 --> 1955.06]  Never.
[1955.06 --> 1956.06]  Come on.
[1956.06 --> 1958.06]  I don't believe you.
[1958.06 --> 1960.06]  I've been a Christian for too long.
[1960.06 --> 1962.06]  I've been a pastor for too long.
[1962.06 --> 1965.06]  We all have doubts at some point.
[1965.06 --> 1967.06]  We all struggle with these disappointments.
[1967.06 --> 1970.06]  And sometimes with outright unbelief.
[1970.06 --> 1975.06]  Some of us doubt, sometimes, that there's a God.
[1975.06 --> 1979.06]  Some of us doubt that God cares for us.
[1979.06 --> 1983.06]  And that he can really make something good of our lives.
[1983.06 --> 1988.06]  Some of us struggle with doubt because we're naturally skeptical kind of people.
[1988.06 --> 1991.06]  I'm one of those people actually.
[1991.06 --> 1994.06]  I think that's what makes me a good chaplain on campus.
[1994.06 --> 1996.06]  Because I find it hard to believe often.
[1996.06 --> 1999.06]  I'm just hardwired to be skeptical.
[1999.06 --> 2001.06]  Some of you are like that, right?
[2001.06 --> 2010.06]  I met a grad student a couple years ago who, in engineering, and she had left the faith.
[2010.06 --> 2013.06]  She said, I grew up going to Sunday school.
[2013.06 --> 2015.06]  But I had too many doubts.
[2015.06 --> 2017.06]  She said, I'm skeptical.
[2017.06 --> 2019.06]  I'm like Thomas in the Bible.
[2019.06 --> 2021.06]  You remember Thomas, right?
[2021.06 --> 2023.06]  Doubting Thomas, as we call him.
[2023.06 --> 2028.06]  He said, show me the proof that Jesus is raised from the dead.
[2028.06 --> 2037.06]  Other people are crushed by doubt because life has crushed them.
[2037.06 --> 2039.06]  Life is hard.
[2039.06 --> 2046.06]  One professor I've been working with for a couple of years, when I met her, said she lost her faith.
[2046.06 --> 2050.06]  She said, quite frankly, I'm not a Christian anymore.
[2050.06 --> 2054.06]  And her life had played out like a Hank Williams song.
[2054.06 --> 2059.06]  Disappointment, betrayal, adultery, death in the family.
[2059.06 --> 2064.06]  It was too much for her to bear, so she walked away from the faith.
[2064.06 --> 2072.06]  And I know from being a pastor and also from being a university chaplain that a lot of good Christians struggle with doubt.
[2072.06 --> 2081.06]  We might not doubt that God exists, but during this pandemic, I think a lot of us were wondering if he really had the whole world in his hands.
[2081.06 --> 2084.06]  And now there's war going on.
[2084.06 --> 2086.06]  We're not doubting God's existence.
[2086.06 --> 2089.06]  We're doubting his promises, we could say.
[2089.06 --> 2098.06]  I just know for a fact that on any given Sunday, in any congregation, there are people here with a deep, strong faith.
[2098.06 --> 2100.06]  And we say hallelujah to that.
[2100.06 --> 2106.06]  But there are also people here who are just hanging on by their fingernails.
[2106.06 --> 2113.06]  And then most of us are probably somewhere in between, I think.
[2113.06 --> 2117.06]  And this key question is, what do we do with these doubts?
[2117.06 --> 2124.06]  What do we do when we struggle with these feelings of unbelief, born of disappointment, born of skepticism?
[2124.06 --> 2128.06]  What do we do with these as Christians?
[2128.06 --> 2130.06]  We hide them, right?
[2130.06 --> 2133.06]  Don't let anyone see.
[2133.06 --> 2135.06]  No.
[2135.06 --> 2142.06]  What I love about this story is that Jesus brings the doubt right out into the open.
[2142.06 --> 2147.06]  He flushes it out into the open so that his light shines on it.
[2147.06 --> 2149.06]  And this is so important.
[2149.06 --> 2158.06]  If I can help you, he says, everything is possible for the person believes.
[2158.06 --> 2163.06]  And then the boy's father gives this answer.
[2163.06 --> 2166.06]  This may be one of the best sentences in the Bible.
[2166.06 --> 2171.06]  I believe, he says, full of emphasis.
[2171.06 --> 2179.06]  And then right afterwards, maybe as a whisper, Jesus, help my unbelief.
[2179.06 --> 2184.06]  You've said that in your heart, haven't you?
[2184.06 --> 2185.06]  I know I have.
[2185.06 --> 2186.06]  I believe.
[2186.06 --> 2190.06]  Jesus, help my unbelief.
[2192.06 --> 2198.06]  We don't want to hide doubt like it's a dirty secret, as if God can't see it.
[2198.06 --> 2207.06]  We need to bring it out into the open and let God's grace encounter it, confront it, help our unbelief.
[2207.06 --> 2215.06]  This is so good for us to do, rather than to pretend that we're super Christians who never doubt, never waver, never struggle.
[2215.06 --> 2218.06]  The fact is, faith can be hard at times.
[2218.06 --> 2222.06]  And hard times make belief more difficult.
[2222.06 --> 2229.06]  Having faith in Jesus Christ doesn't mean we never struggle with doubt or with unbelief.
[2229.06 --> 2236.06]  It means we choose to follow Jesus Christ despite that doubt, despite that unbelief.
[2236.06 --> 2244.06]  Like the father who says, I believe, and follows that by saying, I'm struggling with my unbelief, though.
[2244.06 --> 2245.06]  Jesus, help me.
[2245.06 --> 2250.06]  A leap of faith is required.
[2250.06 --> 2252.06]  We have to choose.
[2252.06 --> 2256.06]  We have to be courageous and choose to follow Jesus despite our doubts.
[2256.06 --> 2260.06]  In this way, we can't be like the crowd in this morning's story.
[2260.06 --> 2269.06]  They see Jesus exorcise this demon, and they still only see death.
[2269.06 --> 2275.06]  The boy was like a corpse, we read, so that most of the people said, he's dead.
[2275.06 --> 2281.06]  Only then does Jesus lift him up and raise him up.
[2281.06 --> 2287.06]  Sometimes everything we look at, everything we experience will look like death.
[2287.06 --> 2296.06]  It's only by the risk of faith that our doubts are overcome and our eyes are opened.
[2296.06 --> 2314.06]  And what we do every Sunday by going to church is we're actually training ourselves to look at this, to look at this scene of death and to see in it life and victory and peace and hope.
[2314.06 --> 2317.06]  This is something we have to practice.
[2317.06 --> 2321.06]  It requires training.
[2321.06 --> 2329.06]  One of my favorite theologians, a great missionary to India in the 20th century named Leslie Newbigin, he says,
[2329.06 --> 2336.06]  Faith is the courage to confidently believe that which can be doubted.
[2336.06 --> 2342.06]  Faith is the courage to confidently believe that which can be doubted.
[2342.06 --> 2344.06]  We believe in something.
[2344.06 --> 2358.06]  We stake our lives on something that can be doubted, which means we have to act with courage and commit ourselves every day to Jesus, to believing God's promise, to overcoming our doubts.
[2358.06 --> 2360.06]  Faith doesn't deny doubt.
[2360.06 --> 2365.06]  It's overcoming it, sometimes daily, by the grace of God.
[2365.06 --> 2370.06]  And I think something really practical follows from this for a congregation.
[2370.06 --> 2373.06]  We want to bring our doubts out into the open before God.
[2373.06 --> 2379.06]  And we want to do this while we're still part of the Christian community, while we're still part of the church.
[2379.06 --> 2382.06]  Here's what I mean.
[2382.06 --> 2390.06]  Remember that grad student in engineering I just told you about, the one who said she was like Thomas.
[2390.06 --> 2392.06]  She was a doubter.
[2392.06 --> 2395.06]  I had a great conversation with her.
[2395.06 --> 2398.06]  So I said, you went to Sunday school.
[2398.06 --> 2401.06]  Remind me, what happened?
[2401.06 --> 2403.06]  What did Thomas do, actually?
[2403.06 --> 2405.06]  And she said, well, I remember the story.
[2405.06 --> 2407.06]  Jesus appeared to his disciples.
[2407.06 --> 2408.06]  You know this story, right?
[2408.06 --> 2409.06]  Many of you do.
[2409.06 --> 2412.06]  Jesus appears to his disciples after he's raised from the dead.
[2412.06 --> 2415.06]  They see him, but Thomas isn't there.
[2415.06 --> 2420.06]  And so a week later, Thomas says, I don't believe.
[2420.06 --> 2422.06]  I don't believe that Jesus is raised from the dead.
[2422.06 --> 2423.06]  This isn't true.
[2423.06 --> 2425.06]  It can't be true.
[2425.06 --> 2430.06]  A week later, Jesus appears to them again, and Thomas is with them.
[2430.06 --> 2433.06]  So she remembers the story.
[2433.06 --> 2434.06]  She's telling it to me.
[2434.06 --> 2435.06]  So I said, hold on, hold on.
[2435.06 --> 2441.06]  So you're saying to me that Thomas doesn't believe that Jesus is raised from the dead.
[2441.06 --> 2444.06]  Where is he on the next Sunday?
[2444.06 --> 2446.06]  And she says, well, he's with the other Christians.
[2446.06 --> 2449.06]  I said, oh, so he went to church.
[2449.06 --> 2452.06]  And she sort of realized where I was going with this.
[2452.06 --> 2455.06]  She didn't really like where I was going with this.
[2455.06 --> 2460.06]  Thomas brought his doubts with him to church.
[2460.06 --> 2462.06]  This student hasn't done that yet.
[2462.06 --> 2463.06]  Not yet.
[2463.06 --> 2466.06]  But I hope God is working on her heart.
[2466.06 --> 2470.06]  I think this story is remarkable, actually.
[2470.06 --> 2475.06]  Thomas doesn't believe in Jesus' resurrection, yet he still is coming out.
[2475.06 --> 2479.06]  He's bringing his doubt with him to the community, to the church.
[2479.06 --> 2483.06]  We want to be that kind of a church community, don't we?
[2483.06 --> 2488.06]  Some of the things that he's going to think today, where people who are struggling still feel like they
[2488.06 --> 2489.06]  can come and worship with us.
[2489.06 --> 2491.06]  They're still part of us.
[2491.06 --> 2494.06]  We want to bring our doubts into the open before God.
[2494.06 --> 2500.06]  We want to do that, not apart from the church, but part of the church.
[2500.06 --> 2504.06]  And that means we always need to make space for people who are struggling.
[2504.06 --> 2510.06]  And hold them in prayer, and love them, and listen to them, and trust that in time,
[2510.06 --> 2514.10]  God will address their doubts and their struggle to believe.
[2515.78 --> 2519.08]  Like this professor that I mentioned earlier,
[2519.22 --> 2523.78]  the one who'd lost her faith because of this almost perfect storm
[2523.78 --> 2526.20]  of terrible circumstances in her life.
[2527.06 --> 2529.26]  I spent quite a bit of time with this professor.
[2529.40 --> 2532.14]  We'd go out for coffee, sometimes for a beer.
[2532.24 --> 2533.02]  We'd have a chat.
[2533.54 --> 2535.16]  I didn't put any pressure on her.
[2535.16 --> 2540.28]  I would just listen to her stories and talk to her about everything,
[2540.52 --> 2542.28]  philosophy, books, whatever.
[2543.26 --> 2544.96]  Just tried to be a friend to her.
[2545.36 --> 2548.56]  And then about two years ago at Easter, I dropped by her office,
[2548.56 --> 2552.30]  and she said, oh, I went to church on Sunday.
[2553.42 --> 2554.18]  I said, did you?
[2555.08 --> 2556.36]  She said, I'm not a Christian.
[2556.50 --> 2559.12]  I'm still not a Christian, but I went to church on Sunday.
[2559.22 --> 2560.46]  I felt like I needed to pray.
[2561.36 --> 2563.24]  And I thought in my head, oh, you're not a Christian yet.
[2563.30 --> 2564.58]  We'll see about that.
[2565.16 --> 2570.00]  So two years later, she does call herself a Christian.
[2571.32 --> 2574.78]  It's like the faith of all the people in church rubbed off on her.
[2575.46 --> 2581.72]  She was going to church scarred but experienced love from the community.
[2582.66 --> 2585.36]  The whole while she's singing psalms.
[2586.44 --> 2589.56]  She's saying the creed.
[2590.52 --> 2591.44]  She's hearing scripture.
[2591.44 --> 2596.88]  She's experiencing Jesus in the bread and the wine.
[2596.88 --> 2597.40]  She's singing.
[2599.08 --> 2603.56]  This is where we want doubters to be.
[2603.92 --> 2605.16]  We want them among us.
[2605.74 --> 2609.32]  We want them singing with us.
[2609.68 --> 2611.58]  We want our faith rubbing off on them.
[2612.24 --> 2615.08]  This is how the Holy Spirit actually brings healing to people
[2615.08 --> 2618.14]  who are struggling with doubt, with unbelief.
[2620.54 --> 2624.58]  You know, a recent report on Generation Z,
[2625.14 --> 2629.92]  so the people who are, the demographic
[2629.92 --> 2633.10]  who's sort of between 18 and 25, Gen Z,
[2633.58 --> 2635.90]  a recent study said that one of the reasons
[2635.90 --> 2638.72]  they leave church when they go off to university
[2638.72 --> 2641.54]  is they don't feel like their churches are often places
[2641.54 --> 2642.96]  where they can bring their questions
[2642.96 --> 2646.32]  and where they can struggle with their doubts openly.
[2648.12 --> 2650.66]  They think we're afraid of their doubts
[2650.66 --> 2653.68]  or that will encourage them to paper over
[2653.68 --> 2655.18]  some of their problems.
[2656.78 --> 2658.34]  I come across this often,
[2658.84 --> 2661.18]  particularly with younger students.
[2661.50 --> 2664.28]  One young man I was mentoring this past year
[2664.28 --> 2667.92]  said he went to a group in an evangelical church
[2667.92 --> 2668.84]  and went to youth group,
[2668.96 --> 2672.92]  and they always told him that following Jesus was great,
[2672.96 --> 2674.58]  and was an amazing adventure,
[2674.88 --> 2676.14]  and he'd have the time of his life,
[2676.56 --> 2678.26]  and Jesus would solve all his problems.
[2678.68 --> 2679.88]  And then he got to university,
[2679.88 --> 2682.78]  and he realized that life was actually kind of difficult,
[2682.78 --> 2684.34]  and he failed at a few things,
[2684.34 --> 2686.72]  and he felt like he was having a crisis of faith.
[2687.30 --> 2689.56]  He said, no, you're just growing up,
[2689.90 --> 2691.08]  just getting used to life.
[2691.08 --> 2694.04]  But he felt like his church wasn't a place
[2694.04 --> 2696.46]  where he could be frank and honest and genuine
[2696.46 --> 2698.36]  about what he was struggling with.
[2698.94 --> 2701.26]  We want to be the kind of community
[2701.26 --> 2703.08]  where people can fail,
[2703.20 --> 2704.16]  where we can fail,
[2704.96 --> 2706.66]  where we can struggle with doubt
[2706.66 --> 2708.28]  and say,
[2708.64 --> 2709.74]  I believe,
[2711.42 --> 2713.22]  and help my unbelief, God.
[2713.22 --> 2716.12]  people who can say amen
[2716.12 --> 2718.74]  with a loud, strong voice
[2718.74 --> 2722.10]  or with just a whisper.
[2725.70 --> 2727.90]  Right now in our world and our culture,
[2728.02 --> 2730.48]  it can feel like the foundations of our lives
[2730.48 --> 2732.14]  is being rattled,
[2732.78 --> 2734.38]  and that can make it very hard
[2734.38 --> 2735.84]  for some of us to follow Jesus.
[2737.74 --> 2740.42]  Disappointment and doubt can creep in,
[2740.42 --> 2742.80]  but let it.
[2744.30 --> 2745.56]  Bring it to church, though.
[2746.38 --> 2747.30]  Bring it to church.
[2748.04 --> 2748.88]  Bring it to God.
[2749.70 --> 2750.88]  Bring it before the cross.
[2751.52 --> 2752.14]  And confess.
[2752.28 --> 2754.20]  Sometimes daily, confess.
[2754.92 --> 2755.62]  I believe.
[2757.18 --> 2759.50]  Jesus, help my unbelief.
[2761.04 --> 2762.84]  Both those things can be true
[2762.84 --> 2764.40]  at the same time
[2764.40 --> 2767.42]  because doubt isn't the opposite of faith.
[2768.06 --> 2769.02]  It's a condition
[2769.02 --> 2772.00]  that makes us daily choose
[2772.00 --> 2774.18]  to follow Jesus Christ with joy
[2774.18 --> 2777.44]  and confess him with confidence.
[2778.94 --> 2779.50]  Amen.
[2784.76 --> 2785.82]  Let's respond
[2785.82 --> 2788.16]  with the words
[2788.16 --> 2790.64]  of the Heidelberg Catechism,
[2791.16 --> 2792.44]  question 129.
[2793.50 --> 2795.30]  If you grew up in the Christian Reformed Church,
[2795.30 --> 2798.68]  you know the Heidelberg Catechism well,
[2798.78 --> 2801.16]  especially Lord's Day 1, right?
[2801.42 --> 2802.68]  We've all memorized that.
[2803.02 --> 2803.88]  For my money,
[2804.02 --> 2804.72]  I actually think
[2804.72 --> 2806.28]  the very last question
[2806.28 --> 2806.78]  and answer
[2806.78 --> 2808.00]  of the Heidelberg Catechism
[2808.00 --> 2809.00]  is the best one,
[2809.52 --> 2811.24]  question 129,
[2811.80 --> 2813.40]  because it's pitched
[2813.40 --> 2814.06]  for people
[2814.06 --> 2815.22]  who struggle with doubt.
[2816.12 --> 2817.62]  It's a reminder to us
[2817.62 --> 2819.24]  that when I end a sermon
[2819.24 --> 2820.06]  with the word amen,
[2820.68 --> 2821.52]  or we end a prayer
[2821.52 --> 2822.42]  with the word amen,
[2823.34 --> 2824.24]  it's true,
[2824.50 --> 2826.90]  not because we happen
[2826.90 --> 2827.62]  to believe it,
[2828.42 --> 2830.04]  but because it's sealed
[2830.04 --> 2831.08]  in Jesus Christ,
[2831.78 --> 2832.90]  who's the foundation
[2832.90 --> 2833.60]  of our faith.
[2836.68 --> 2838.68]  So Heidelberg question 129
[2838.68 --> 2839.90]  says,
[2840.50 --> 2842.28]  what does this little word
[2842.28 --> 2844.42]  amen express?
[2844.42 --> 2847.40]  and we respond together,
[2848.50 --> 2849.36]  amen means,
[2850.04 --> 2851.38]  this shall truly
[2851.38 --> 2852.58]  and surely be,
[2853.42 --> 2854.86]  it is even more sure
[2854.86 --> 2857.16]  that God listens to my prayer
[2857.16 --> 2859.36]  than that I really desire
[2859.36 --> 2860.86]  what I pray for.
[2864.16 --> 2865.60]  Lord, I believe,
[2866.68 --> 2867.78]  help my unbelief.
[2869.00 --> 2871.24]  That's the Heidelberg Catechism's
[2871.24 --> 2873.40]  version of this Bible verse.
[2873.40 --> 2875.56]  Amen.
[2876.38 --> 2877.86]  Let's join together in worship.
[2891.42 --> 2892.98]  Let's stand for this hymn.
[2903.40 --> 2908.40]  voice if ye cupless,
[2908.40 --> 2908.44]  let's sing and sing and sing
[2908.44 --> 2909.06]  to Him on our ama.
[2909.06 --> 2910.28]  Our home, our holy name
[2910.28 --> 2910.54]  is a pure love of prisoners.
[2910.64 --> 2911.52]  ciento stand by manage the addition
[2911.52 --> 2912.36]  of the passage
[2912.44 --> 2912.68]  that Heidelberg Catechism's
[2912.70 --> 2913.58]  well end of our viruses.
[2913.60 --> 2914.38]  Do it, never an election
[2914.38 --> 2914.40]  is the only way to say
[2914.40 --> 2916.24]  that we could teve no error
[2918.42 --> 2918.96]  or void in our riot Hijabbal?
[2919.02 --> 2919.94]  It is aろ!

[2980.84 --> 2990.84]  Blessed is the righteousness of all, All us to stand before the throne.
[2990.84 --> 3005.84]  All our love is singing sound, All our love is singing sound, All our love is singing sound.
[3011.84 --> 3016.84]  At this point we're going to take our offering, and this morning's offering is for Raise Up Global Ministries,
[3016.84 --> 3019.84]  which is a ministry of the Christian Reformed Church.
[3019.84 --> 3025.84]  In your bulletin there's a little flyer about it, and it supports Coffee Break,
[3025.84 --> 3031.84]  encourages Coffee Break, Timothy training programs and educational initiatives.
[3031.84 --> 3038.84]  So I'll call upon the deacons to take our offering.
[3038.84 --> 3057.56]  My Sugar Refugeitating
[3057.56 --> 3058.56]  Amen.
[3087.56 --> 3089.56]  Amen.
[3117.56 --> 3119.56]  Amen.
[3147.56 --> 3149.56]  Amen.
[3177.56 --> 3179.56]  Amen.
[3179.56 --> 3181.56]  Amen.
[3181.56 --> 3183.56]  Amen.
[3183.56 --> 3187.56]  Please join me in our community prayer.
[3187.56 --> 3191.56]  Now we offer our prayers and thanksgivings and intercession.
[3191.56 --> 3196.56]  May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in your sight,
[3196.56 --> 3199.56]  O Lord, our rock and redeemer.
[3199.56 --> 3204.56]  Gracious God, you created the world in beauty, you created us in your image,
[3204.56 --> 3209.56]  and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[3209.56 --> 3211.56]  We are thankful for the communities we live in,
[3211.56 --> 3214.56]  for the services which we sometimes take for granted,
[3214.56 --> 3220.56]  for clean water, for public servants such as police, judges, doctors, nurses,
[3220.56 --> 3225.56]  firefighters, paramedics, education, many others.
[3225.56 --> 3229.56]  Lord, we pray for our nation, for our prime minister, our premier,
[3229.56 --> 3234.56]  and the mayors of the communities we represent in Delta and Richmond.
[3234.56 --> 3237.56]  Give them wisdom in their leadership.
[3237.56 --> 3239.56]  We pray for our broken world.
[3239.56 --> 3245.56]  For Christians around this world, we want to especially remember Christians in the country of Iran.
[3245.56 --> 3248.56]  Many persons are coming to faith there.
[3248.56 --> 3250.56]  Protect your church there.
[3250.56 --> 3257.56]  We pray for change of heart in the leadership of Iran to give more freedoms to Christian believers.
[3257.56 --> 3259.56]  We also pray for the church in Nigeria.
[3259.56 --> 3265.56]  Christians have suffered much through violence and terrorism in this country.
[3265.56 --> 3266.56]  Please uphold this.
[3266.56 --> 3269.56]  We ask you to uphold this church.
[3269.56 --> 3273.56]  Plus, ongoing efforts to bring relief to refugees around the world.
[3273.56 --> 3280.56]  It seems to have dropped off the front pages, but there is still an ongoing crisis happening in Afghanistan.
[3280.56 --> 3283.56]  We pray for this country and its people.
[3283.56 --> 3289.56]  Very much in our heart and mind is the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
[3289.56 --> 3294.56]  We see the images in the media, and our hearts go out to all those uprooted,
[3294.56 --> 3297.56]  millions who have fled their homes and have become refugees.
[3297.56 --> 3303.56]  We pray for those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[3303.56 --> 3308.56]  Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating this violence and bring an end to this.
[3308.56 --> 3315.56]  Bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable conflicts.
[3315.56 --> 3322.56]  We pray for our world as we see a rise in authoritarian power in many countries.
[3322.56 --> 3324.56]  We pray for our church.
[3324.56 --> 3330.56]  Bless our ministry leaders for Pastor Jason, Associate Pastor Nancy,
[3330.56 --> 3335.56]  and our children's ministry coordinator, Hannah, and our deacons and elders.
[3335.56 --> 3341.56]  We are thankful for all those children and teachers involved in kids' life.
[3341.56 --> 3346.56]  We are thankful for the kids' camp this past week organized by our Chinese ministry.
[3346.56 --> 3351.56]  I also bless the planning for kids' camp coming up in August.
[3351.56 --> 3357.56]  May young lives be touched by the gospel in both of these camps.
[3357.56 --> 3366.56]  We pray for our denomination and ask a blessing on all the ministries like World Renew, Resonate, amongst many others.
[3366.56 --> 3372.56]  We want to particularly pray for Todd this morning in his work at UBC Okanagan.
[3372.56 --> 3381.56]  Bless his continued witness on campus and the conversations he is able to have with students and faculty there who are searching.
[3381.56 --> 3383.56]  Bless him there.
[3383.56 --> 3387.56]  We want to remember and bring before you the needs in our own congregation.
[3387.56 --> 3389.56]  For young Richie Hendrickson.
[3389.56 --> 3393.56]  Bless his ongoing care and we pray for healing.
[3393.56 --> 3396.56]  Uphold Richie's family during this stressful time.
[3396.56 --> 3400.56]  For those who are living in care or facing long-term illness.
[3400.56 --> 3411.56]  For Joyce, Carl, Grace, Jerry and Anne, Shirley, Jeanette, John, Henry, Ellie, and Jeanette Ram.
[3411.56 --> 3414.56]  We pray for their families and their caregivers.
[3414.56 --> 3421.56]  Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts like mental illness and depression,
[3421.56 --> 3427.56]  addictions and broken relationships in families, friendships, and marriages.
[3427.56 --> 3436.56]  Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer
[3436.56 --> 3453.56]  and to live faithfully in response to your call through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[3453.56 --> 3457.56]  Please rise for God's benediction.
[3457.56 --> 3458.56]  Jesus Christ says,
[3458.56 --> 3465.56]  In this world you will have trouble, but don't lose heart because I have overcome the world.
[3465.56 --> 3472.56]  May these words be sealed on our spirits this week as we leave with the blessing of God.
[3472.56 --> 3483.56]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God our Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be upon each of us this day and forever. Amen.

[3503.56 --> 3504.56]  Let's pray for our final song.
[3504.56 --> 3505.76]  Let's pray for our final song.
[3505.76 --> 3507.56]  Let's pray for our final song.
[3507.56 --> 3514.10]  But Does the more greed in life they face?
[3514.10 --> 3520.76]  We'll lay there you share with him of everyone hearing
[3520.84 --> 3527.44]  Embracing our sin, the whole human race
[3527.44 --> 3532.78]  Come from Fees, you away us and privacy
[3532.78 --> 3540.78]  The Lord has to light us and shine in this earth that we share.
[3541.38 --> 3546.92]  When we are the living in praise and grace,
[3546.92 --> 3555.20]  we give honor to Christ in this name that we bear.
[3562.78 --> 3580.46]  Sh stereo.
[3580.98 --> 3583.84]  So
[3583.84 --> 3613.82]  Thank you.
