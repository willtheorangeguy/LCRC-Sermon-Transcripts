[782.98 → 788.08] I'll worship your holy name.
[791.36 → 796.88] The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[797.36 → 801.48] It's time to sing a song again.
[802.28 → 806.80] Over may pass, whatever might be falling.
[806.80 → 813.80] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[816.40 → 820.60] Bless the Lord of my souls.
[823.04 → 826.88] Worship his holy name.
[827.60 → 830.46] Sing like never before.
[830.46 → 836.76] All my soul, I worship your holy name.
[836.80 → 837.80] Amen.
[840.66 → 845.80] For rich you are and your soul to gain.
[846.40 → 850.88] Your name is great, and your heart is kind.
[851.38 → 856.18] For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[857.40 → 862.74] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[862.74 → 868.74] Bless the Lord of my soul.
[868.74 → 870.74] Oh, my soul.
[870.74 → 874.74] Worship his holy name.
[874.74 → 878.74] Sing like never before.
[878.74 → 880.74] All my soul.
[880.74 → 882.08] All my soul.
[882.40 → 885.74] I'll worship your holy name.
[885.74 → 895.06] And on that day when my strength is made.
[895.74 → 899.84] The end was near, and my time has gone.
[900.74 → 905.38] Still my soul will sing your praise unending.
[905.38 → 912.38] Ten thousand years and then forevermore.
[912.38 → 914.38] Bless the Lord of my soul.
[914.38 → 918.38] Bless the Lord of my soul.
[918.38 → 920.38] Oh, my soul.
[920.38 → 922.38] Worship his holy name.
[922.38 → 924.38] Worship his holy name.
[924.38 → 927.38] Sing like never before.
[927.38 → 928.38] Oh, my soul.
[928.38 → 930.38] I'll worship your holy name.
[930.38 → 932.38] Oh, my soul.
[932.38 → 936.38] I'll worship your holy name.
[936.38 → 937.38] Worship your holy name.
[937.38 → 938.38] Worship your holy name.
[938.38 → 943.38] Worship your holy name.
[943.38 → 947.38] Worship your holy name.
[947.38 → 949.38] Oh, my soul.
[949.38 → 964.38] Worship your holy name.
[968.38 → 973.38] This is my Father's womb
[973.38 → 978.50] And to my listening ears
[978.50 → 983.12] All nature sings and found me
[983.12 → 987.74] The music of the spheres
[987.74 → 993.12] This is my Father's world
[993.12 → 997.76] I'm next in the thought
[997.76 → 1003.00] Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
[1003.00 → 1007.52] And the wonder is why
[1007.52 → 1013.08] This is my Father's world
[1013.08 → 1018.02] The birds and arrows raise
[1018.02 → 1023.52] The morning light, the living body
[1023.52 → 1027.76] Where their makers praise
[1027.76 → 1032.72] This is my Father's world
[1032.72 → 1037.24] He shines in all that's fair
[1037.24 → 1042.50] In the rustling glass I hear them
[1042.50 → 1047.40] As He speaks to me every day
[1047.40 → 1052.92] This is my Father's world
[1052.92 → 1057.44] All let me not forget
[1057.44 → 1063.90] The love of the wrong seems up so strong
[1063.90 → 1066.66] God is a ruler
[1066.66 → 1072.44] This is my Father's world
[1072.44 → 1076.96] I'm sure my heart is glad
[1076.96 → 1081.22] The Lord is King
[1081.22 → 1083.42] Let heaven speak
[1083.42 → 1086.72] God brings and earth to me
[1086.72 → 1088.18] That last phrase again
[1088.18 → 1091.18] The Lord is King
[1091.18 → 1091.70] The Lord is King
[1091.70 → 1093.70] Let heaven speak
[1093.70 → 1097.96] God brings and earth to me
[1097.96 → 1103.74] You may be seated
[1103.74 → 1103.78] You may be seated
[1103.78 → 1115.42] So one of the several very exciting things happening today
[1115.42 → 1121.44] Is that we are installing and ordaining our new office bearers for elder and deacon
[1121.44 → 1123.98] And so before we do that
[1123.98 → 1125.96] Let me give an explanation
[1125.96 → 1129.24] According to the form of the CRC
[1129.24 → 1132.28] So congregation of Jesus Christ
[1132.28 → 1136.82] Today we celebrate God's gift of faithful leadership for His people
[1136.82 → 1141.36] We joyfully thank Him for the elders and deacons
[1141.36 → 1144.50] Who have served us so well and completed their terms of office
[1144.50 → 1152.48] So those who have completed their terms of office are Harry Van Toll, Marion Van Drill, Peter Glimpse, and Rick Henderson
[1152.48 → 1158.20] So we praise the Lord for all that they have done for us over the last few years
[1158.20 → 1162.48] And we thank Him just for the work that He has done through them
[1162.48 → 1168.24] And we also praise God for providing successors
[1168.24 → 1172.30] So in the office bearers of the church
[1172.30 → 1174.92] We see the love of Christ for His people
[1174.92 → 1177.32] As the Lord of the church
[1177.32 → 1180.50] He appoints leaders to govern in His name
[1180.50 → 1184.76] And to promote the spiritual well-being of His people
[1184.76 → 1186.36] By His Spirit
[1186.36 → 1188.40] He equips these leaders
[1188.40 → 1191.88] So that believers may grow in faith
[1191.88 → 1194.58] Develop disciplined Christian living
[1194.58 → 1197.30] Serve others in selfless love
[1197.30 → 1200.24] And share with all the good news of salvation
[1200.24 → 1205.28] The Apostle Paul stated this most clearly when he wrote to the church
[1205.28 → 1208.62] So Christ Himself gave the Apostles
[1208.62 → 1209.54] The prophets
[1209.54 → 1211.04] The evangelists
[1211.04 → 1212.62] The pastors and teachers
[1212.62 → 1215.00] To equip His people
[1215.00 → 1216.66] For works of service
[1216.66 → 1219.48] So that the body of Christ may be built up
[1219.48 → 1222.06] Until we reach unity in the faith
[1222.06 → 1224.24] And in the knowledge of the Son of God
[1224.24 → 1225.56] And become mature
[1225.56 → 1229.24] Attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ
[1229.24 → 1230.26] That's in Ephesians 4
[1230.26 → 1235.88] And Jesus Christ taught us the spirit of true leadership
[1235.88 → 1237.22] When He said
[1237.22 → 1240.80] Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
[1240.80 → 1244.62] And whoever wants to be first must be your slave
[1244.62 → 1247.92] Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served
[1247.92 → 1248.82] But to serve
[1248.82 → 1252.18] And to give His life as a ransom for many
[1252.18 → 1256.32] So elders and deacons
[1256.32 → 1261.80] Elders serve by exercising oversight of the church in Christ's name
[1261.80 → 1265.94] The Apostle Paul told the elders at Ephesus
[1265.94 → 1268.42] Keep watch over yourselves
[1268.42 → 1273.40] And all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers
[1273.40 → 1276.30] Be shepherds of the church of God
[1276.30 → 1278.90] Which He bought with His own blood
[1278.90 → 1283.06] Elders must provide for the true preaching of the word
[1283.06 → 1287.34] Instruction for faith formation for both youth and adults
[1287.34 → 1290.42] Regular celebration of the sacraments
[1290.42 → 1293.58] And faithful counsel and discipline
[1293.58 → 1297.26] While keeping in confidence those matters entrusted to them
[1297.26 → 1301.58] And they must promote fellowship and hospitality among believers
[1301.58 → 1304.06] Ensure good order in the church
[1304.06 → 1305.70] And stimulate witness to all people
[1305.70 → 1307.84] That's a lot of tasks
[1307.84 → 1310.40] Deacons likewise
[1310.40 → 1313.56] They serve by leading and equipping the church
[1313.56 → 1315.12] To minister to its members
[1315.12 → 1316.22] And the world
[1316.22 → 1319.28] In a rich diversity of ministries
[1319.28 → 1321.24] Awakening compassion
[1321.24 → 1323.04] Demonstrating mercy
[1323.04 → 1324.66] Seeking justice
[1324.66 → 1327.30] And collaborating with God's Spirit
[1327.30 → 1330.72] For the transformation of persons and communities
[1330.72 → 1333.88] In imitation of Christ's mercy
[1333.88 → 1336.52] Deacons teach us to love God
[1336.52 → 1337.70] Our neighbours
[1337.70 → 1339.58] And the creation
[1339.58 → 1341.86] With acts of generous sharing
[1341.86 → 1343.42] Joyful hospitality
[1343.42 → 1344.92] Thoughtful care
[1344.92 → 1348.18] And wise stewardship of all of God's gifts
[1348.18 → 1351.42] Deacons offer holistic responses
[1351.42 → 1353.88] That respect the dignity of all people
[1353.88 → 1357.56] Working to change exploitative structures and systems
[1357.56 → 1361.40] Equipping the church for ministries of reconciliation and peacemaking
[1361.40 → 1363.68] And seeking opportunities for advocacy
[1363.68 → 1366.38] To help them accomplish these tasks
[1366.38 → 1369.46] Deacons are to identify and develop gifts
[1369.46 → 1371.16] In both the church and the community
[1371.16 → 1375.64] By adding to all this words of encouragement and hope
[1375.64 → 1377.70] Deacons demonstrate in word and deed
[1377.70 → 1379.74] The care of the Lord himself
[1379.74 → 1383.40] Also quite a job description
[1383.40 → 1386.50] So the deacons and the elders
[1386.50 → 1388.10] Together with the ministers
[1388.10 → 1391.18] Are responsible for the general administration of the church
[1391.18 → 1393.82] These tasks of elders and deacons
[1393.82 → 1395.72] Call for believers who are Christ-like
[1395.72 → 1397.84] Who are mature in the faith
[1397.84 → 1399.58] And who exercise their offices
[1399.58 → 1402.42] With prayer, patience, and humility
[1402.42 → 1405.48] And so
[1405.48 → 1406.32] I still want to
[1406.32 → 1408.68] Be ordained
[1408.68 → 1411.30] Today
[1411.30 → 1414.22] We intend to ordain
[1414.22 → 1414.98] An elder
[1414.98 → 1416.30] And two deacons
[1416.30 → 1418.44] And to install them for terms of service
[1418.44 → 1419.20] In this congregation
[1419.20 → 1419.94] So
[1419.94 → 1421.46] The one appointed
[1421.46 → 1423.00] To the office of elder
[1423.00 → 1423.88] Is Jack Mantra
[1423.88 → 1425.82] And the two
[1425.82 → 1427.90] Appointed to the office of deacon
[1427.90 → 1429.34] Are Brian Grot endorse
[1429.34 → 1430.32] And Elaine Smith
[1430.32 → 1433.10] To express
[1433.10 → 1435.04] Their acceptance of these offices
[1435.04 → 1436.82] I want to invite them to come up front
[1436.82 → 1437.38] Now
[1437.38 → 1440.66] And they will be asked to stand
[1440.66 → 1442.14] And hear in the presence of God
[1442.14 → 1442.94] And his church
[1442.94 → 1443.62] To answer
[1443.62 → 1445.38] A few questions
[1445.38 → 1455.82] Do you believe
[1455.82 → 1458.58] So I'll ask you several questions
[1458.58 → 1459.02] And then
[1459.02 → 1459.98] One by one
[1459.98 → 1460.92] I'll ask you to respond
[1460.92 → 1462.92] Do you believe that
[1462.92 → 1463.68] In the call
[1463.68 → 1464.80] Of this congregation
[1464.80 → 1466.36] God himself
[1466.36 → 1467.82] Is calling you
[1467.82 → 1469.72] To these holy offices
[1469.72 → 1472.04] Do you believe that
[1472.04 → 1473.74] The old and new testaments
[1473.74 → 1474.98] Are the word of God
[1474.98 → 1477.38] The only infallible rule
[1477.38 → 1478.66] Of faith and life
[1478.66 → 1480.48] Do you subscribe
[1480.48 → 1482.02] To the doctrinal standards
[1482.02 → 1483.00] Of this church
[1483.00 → 1484.84] Rejecting all teaching
[1484.84 → 1486.12] Which contradicts them
[1486.12 → 1487.96] Do you promise
[1487.96 → 1488.64] To do the work
[1488.64 → 1489.88] Of your offices faithfully
[1489.88 → 1491.40] In a way worthy
[1491.40 → 1492.28] Of your calling
[1492.28 → 1493.30] In its submission
[1493.30 → 1493.98] To the government
[1493.98 → 1494.64] And discipline
[1494.64 → 1496.02] Of the church
[1496.02 → 1499.20] So Jack
[1499.20 → 1500.08] What is your answer
[1500.08 → 1502.60] And Elaine
[1502.60 → 1503.50] What is your answer
[1503.50 → 1505.98] And Brian
[1505.98 → 1506.74] What is your answer
[1506.74 → 1508.76] Okay
[1508.76 → 1511.92] And so let me now
[1511.92 → 1512.64] Invite up
[1512.64 → 1513.64] All of our
[1513.64 → 1515.04] Current and outgoing
[1515.04 → 1516.70] Elders and deacons
[1516.70 → 1517.70] Will you please come up
[1517.70 → 1518.84] And we are going to lay hands
[1518.84 → 1520.04] On our new office bearers
[1520.04 → 1521.54] And pray for them
[1521.54 → 1546.82] Okay
[1546.82 → 1548.12] Let's pray
[1548.12 → 1551.68] God our heavenly father
[1551.68 → 1553.54] Who has called you
[1553.54 → 1554.90] To these sacred offices
[1554.90 → 1556.44] Guide you
[1556.44 → 1557.42] By his word
[1557.42 → 1559.30] Equip you
[1559.30 → 1560.38] With his spirit
[1560.38 → 1561.80] And so prosper
[1561.80 → 1562.64] Your ministries
[1562.64 → 1563.56] That his church
[1563.56 → 1564.82] May increase
[1564.82 → 1566.22] In his name
[1566.22 → 1567.50] Be praised
[1567.50 → 1569.04] Amen
[1569.04 → 1571.36] All right
[1571.36 → 1571.86] Thank you
[1571.86 → 1573.56] No you guys stay
[1573.56 → 1575.44] You all can go back

[1585.80 → 1586.68] And then the deacons
[1586.68 → 1588.14] I charge you
[1588.14 → 1588.78] Elder

[1962.38 → 1963.72] To all
[1963.72 → 1969.96] I will weep

[1979.88 → 1981.34] Your joy
[1981.34 → 1982.64] And sorrow
[1982.64 → 1985.02] Till we've seen
[1985.02 → 1986.50] This journey
[1986.50 → 1993.10] Will you let me
[1993.10 → 1993.38] Let me be
[1993.38 → 1993.60] Will you let me
[1993.60 → 1995.34] Be as servant
[1995.34 → 1997.60] Let me be
[1997.60 → 1998.74] As Christ
[1998.74 → 2000.00] To you
[2000.00 → 2002.88] Pray that I'm
[2002.88 → 2004.02] In heaven
[2004.02 → 2005.32] For Christ
[2005.32 → 2007.84] Let you be
[2007.84 → 2009.32] My servant
[2009.32 → 2013.24] That our family life
[2013.24 → 2043.22] Thank you.
[2043.54 → 2048.46] Our confession of faith is quite simple this morning, but profound.
[2049.32 → 2054.12] It comes from the Westminster Shorter Catechism, question and answer one, and it's here on the screen.
[2055.00 → 2055.72] Let's say it together.
[2055.88 → 2056.56] It's my question.
[2057.54 → 2059.78] What is the chief end of man?
[2061.14 → 2061.64] The answer.
[2062.62 → 2068.44] Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[2068.44 → 2076.24] However, God's purpose is that you would find enjoyment in his love for you.
[2077.04 → 2083.66] That you would find enjoyment in his grace for you and the sacrifice of his son for you at this table.
[2083.66 → 2100.38] So far beyond the taste of the juice and the taste of the bread, these are pointers to the Lord's desire that your soul would find satisfaction in tasting and seeing that the Lord himself is good.
[2100.38 → 2107.20] And so this table is for those whom Jesus has made his worshippers.
[2107.92 → 2112.44] Those whom Jesus has called out of darkness into his marvellous light.
[2113.00 → 2119.78] Those whom Jesus has shown mercy who have acknowledged their sin and turned to Jesus as their saviour.
[2119.78 → 2124.36] If this is not you yet, we would love to talk to you about that.
[2125.04 → 2128.92] But for today, refrain from taking the elements as they are past.
[2132.52 → 2137.56] So here's how the scripture frames our feasting at this table.
[2138.56 → 2143.34] The apostle Paul wrote this in 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[2145.34 → 2146.44] He said this,
[2146.44 → 2173.62] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying this is the blood, this is the cup of the new covenant in my blood.
[2173.62 → 2177.62] Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[2178.18 → 2186.24] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[2189.18 → 2197.26] So brothers and sisters, let's say the quorum day, our words of liturgy, which we'll have up on the screen.
[2198.04 → 2199.42] Friends, lift your hearts.
[2200.42 → 2202.10] We lift them up to the Lord.
[2202.10 → 2204.04] We are his people.
[2204.66 → 2207.02] We are redeemed by his grace.
[2207.46 → 2209.44] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[2210.26 → 2211.24] Christ has died.
[2211.76 → 2212.72] Christ is risen.
[2213.28 → 2214.70] Christ will come again.
[2215.12 → 2217.90] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[2218.20 → 2218.52] Hallelujah.
[2220.66 → 2224.24] These are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[2224.24 → 2225.98] Take these.
[2225.98 → 2226.02] Take these.
[2226.02 → 2230.94] And feed upon him by faith in your hearts with Thanksgiving.
[2231.44 → 2233.16] Knowing, trusting, and believing.
[2233.90 → 2238.66] And taking great joy in the fact that Christ has died for you.
[2238.66 → 2246.80] Now may I invite our elders to come forward and help serve the elements.
[2246.80 → 2248.00] And maybe we can reach your your as tonight.
[2248.00 → 2248.78] Because we bring the needs to be Delta 다음에.
[2248.78 → 2248.98] Say, we're supposed to be after this.

[2694.18 → 2695.40] Please join me in prayer.
[2697.28 → 2698.42] Our Heavenly Father,
[2699.32 → 2702.48] we thank you that you have created us,
[2703.10 → 2704.74] that the purpose of our lives
[2704.74 → 2707.80] would be to enjoy you forever
[2707.80 → 2709.04] and to glorify you
[2709.04 → 2712.78] in every time and place and area of our lives.
[2713.52 → 2714.36] And we thank you, Lord,
[2714.42 → 2715.60] that you have called us to this
[2715.60 → 2717.76] and you haven't left us alone,
[2717.86 → 2719.48] but you equip us to do so
[2719.48 → 2721.20] by the calling of your grace,
[2721.78 → 2723.14] by the indwelling of your spirit.
[2723.96 → 2726.68] And Lord, as you have fed us this morning at your table,
[2727.38 → 2728.66] would you go forth with us
[2728.66 → 2729.90] and help us to live for you,
[2729.98 → 2731.58] to enjoy and glorify you
[2731.58 → 2734.26] as we leave from here and go about our week.
[2734.74 → 2736.20] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2736.56 → 2736.84] Amen.
[2747.86 → 2749.64] Okay, may I invite the children,
[2750.60 → 2751.78] if there's a couple of you here,
[2751.98 → 2752.34] I hope,
[2752.80 → 2754.58] to come and sit with me
[2754.58 → 2756.22] and I want to share something with you.
[2756.22 → 2770.36] Come on.
[2770.36 → 2772.50] Come on.
[2772.50 → 2784.40] Come on.
[2784.40 → 2784.42] Come on.
[2785.78 → 2788.38] All right.
[2788.48 → 2788.92] Hello.
[2789.10 → 2789.34] Hello.
[2790.90 → 2791.88] How are you all today?
[2793.14 → 2795.06] Did all of you come to the camp last week?
[2797.06 → 2798.56] Did you come to the camp this week?
[2798.56 → 2799.18] I don't know.
[2799.68 → 2800.38] I don't know.
[2800.56 → 2800.98] Maybe not.
[2801.56 → 2802.54] Maybe some of you did.
[2802.66 → 2803.56] Maybe some of you didn't.
[2804.06 → 2805.12] Maybe some of you were too young.
[2805.36 → 2805.58] Yeah.
[2805.98 → 2806.56] Yeah, it's okay.
[2808.44 → 2810.38] I want to share something with you.
[2811.34 → 2812.78] Does anybody know what this is?
[2814.26 → 2815.26] Do you know what this is?
[2815.34 → 2815.66] Camera?
[2816.20 → 2817.00] It's not a camera.
[2817.10 → 2817.82] That's a good guess.
[2818.96 → 2819.74] Well, I'll show you.
[2820.28 → 2821.84] It's something to do with camping.
[2822.10 → 2823.16] Does anybody like camping here?
[2823.16 → 2823.48] Yeah.
[2824.14 → 2824.92] You guys like camping?
[2824.92 → 2829.12] Well, sometimes when you're camping, you like camping?
[2829.24 → 2829.32] Yeah.
[2829.98 → 2833.74] The thing about camping is at night, what happens at night?
[2834.44 → 2835.12] It gets up.
[2835.16 → 2835.80] It sure does.
[2836.62 → 2844.20] And what if you, what if you go to the bathroom at night, and you have to walk along a dark path
[2844.20 → 2849.58] in the woods to find the bathroom or to, or maybe you're just walking in the woods at
[2849.58 → 2852.48] night, and maybe you're walking along, and I can't see anything.
[2852.48 → 2853.64] I might run into a tree.
[2853.74 → 2854.76] I might trip on a root.
[2855.38 → 2857.20] I might run into a skunk.
[2857.44 → 2857.84] Who knows?
[2857.92 → 2859.30] I don't know, but I can't see.
[2859.90 → 2860.54] I know.
[2860.90 → 2863.82] And then what if all of a sudden I remember something?
[2863.94 → 2864.68] What do I remember?
[2866.32 → 2868.16] I'm wearing a flashlight.
[2868.74 → 2869.14] See?
[2869.90 → 2871.18] Try not to put in your eyes.
[2871.72 → 2872.02] Yeah.
[2872.12 → 2872.84] I have a flashlight.
[2873.30 → 2876.80] And if I put this on, I can see, I can see the path.
[2876.80 → 2877.28] Right?
[2878.72 → 2878.86] So.
[2880.96 → 2882.64] Now, this reminded me of a verse.
[2882.78 → 2883.90] Sorry, I won't shine on your eye anymore.
[2885.24 → 2886.94] Maybe, I think you might know this verse.
[2887.04 → 2890.86] It's a very special verse that children love, and I loved when I was a kid.
[2893.24 → 2893.40] Yeah.
[2894.46 → 2894.78] Yeah.
[2895.02 → 2895.48] What was that?
[2898.04 → 2899.54] There might be a bear too, right?
[2899.64 → 2901.76] And if you have a light, maybe it'll scare it away.
[2901.76 → 2902.20] Okay.
[2902.20 → 2902.56] Okay.
[2902.80 → 2904.98] So here's what God says in his Bible.
[2905.94 → 2911.32] Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.
[2911.62 → 2916.68] I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws.
[2917.56 → 2920.84] The Bible says that the Bible is like this lamp.
[2921.62 → 2926.52] The Bible is God's word, and it is our light in the darkness.
[2927.12 → 2930.60] So when we don't know which way to go, and we're walking in the dark,
[2930.60 → 2931.94] you know what we can do?
[2932.40 → 2933.78] We can open up this Bible.
[2934.70 → 2940.16] And this Bible, by reading the Bible, we are able to carry a flashlight with us all the time.
[2940.58 → 2943.08] We can always know the way to go.
[2943.74 → 2944.00] Right?
[2945.64 → 2947.80] And this also talked about an oath.
[2947.98 → 2948.88] Do you know what an oath is?
[2949.24 → 2951.60] If you take an oath, it's like you make a promise.
[2951.60 → 2954.18] You know?
[2954.36 → 2961.44] And the person who wrote this, the psalmist, he took an oath to always follow God's ways.
[2963.38 → 2964.34] It's a promise.
[2964.96 → 2965.16] Yeah.
[2965.38 → 2965.68] It's good.
[2965.78 → 2970.74] He made a promise, an oath, a promise to say I will always follow God's ways.
[2971.20 → 2972.38] And we have God's ways.
[2972.48 → 2974.36] We know how to follow God because of the Bible.
[2974.68 → 2975.08] Okay?
[2975.40 → 2976.32] Can you remember that?
[2976.40 → 2977.04] What is this like?
[2977.12 → 2977.88] What's the Bible like?
[2977.88 → 2980.02] A lamp.
[2980.28 → 2981.16] What's the Bible like?
[2982.32 → 2983.08] A lamp.
[2983.32 → 2983.84] Can you say a lamp?
[2985.44 → 2985.84] Okay.
[2986.18 → 2986.66] Let's pray.
[2987.42 → 2988.76] Can we pray together like this?
[2988.78 → 2990.18] You have to fold your hands like this.
[2990.26 → 2990.78] Can you do this?
[2991.20 → 2991.86] Good job.
[2992.22 → 2992.40] Yeah.
[2993.76 → 2998.44] Father, thank you for giving us the Bible to be our light.
[2999.08 → 3000.46] In Jesus' name we pray.
[3000.76 → 3001.14] Amen.
[3002.10 → 3002.46] All right.
[3002.52 → 3003.60] Go ahead back to your seats.
[3003.72 → 3004.66] Thank you for joining me.
[3004.66 → 3004.72] Thank you.
[3004.72 → 3004.80] Thank you.
[3004.80 → 3004.86] Thank you.
[3007.88 → 3008.30] That's okay.
[3009.50 → 3011.12] Thank you for watching out for your little sister.
[3011.98 → 3012.14] Okay?
[3012.62 → 3013.28] You got it?
[3013.98 → 3015.02] Yeah, I need a rascal.
[3015.52 → 3016.68] It's a little rascal.
[3016.68 → 3044.50] The children, you may go to Sunday school,
[3044.50 → 3048.70] ages three to grade one, and our Chinese brothers and sisters,
[3048.70 → 3052.06] you may go with Pastor Nancy and hear your sermon.
[3052.06 → 3054.06] So you are all dismissed.
[3074.50 → 3090.86] Today's scripture reading is from Ephesians 3, verse 14 to 19.
[3090.86 → 3097.22] For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven derives its name.
[3097.74 → 3103.98] I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being,
[3104.40 → 3107.00] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[3107.24 → 3111.26] And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[3111.76 → 3114.48] may have power together with all the Lord's holy people,
[3114.48 → 3118.92] to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
[3119.28 → 3122.22] and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[3122.50 → 3126.18] that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
[3126.86 → 3128.44] This is the word of the Lord.
[3128.44 → 3129.66] Thank you.
[3129.66 → 3144.68] Very well-read.
[3144.68 → 3146.40] It's a wonderful passage.
[3159.66 → 3160.66] Thank you.
[3162.28 → 3162.76] Okay.
[3163.06 → 3164.06] Please bow with me in prayer.
[3165.64 → 3168.06] Our Father, our God,
[3168.62 → 3174.68] I pray for the Holy Spirit's conviction, comfort, and guidance as we open up your word.
[3175.30 → 3178.30] We thank you for what Paul has prayed here concerning the church.
[3178.96 → 3183.66] And Lord, would you help us to learn from it this morning and help us to be changed by it.
[3184.04 → 3185.48] We ask in Christ's name.
[3186.20 → 3186.52] Amen.
[3186.52 → 3186.60] Amen.
[3187.56 → 3194.20] So today we're picking back up in our sermon series that we started in June on the letter of the Ephesians.
[3194.56 → 3200.84] And we're calling this series Life Together because the letter of Ephesians is all about the church.
[3201.42 → 3208.88] It's about God bringing both Jew and Gentile together as one new humanity that he calls the church.
[3208.94 → 3213.18] He calls the body of Christ and the temple, this thing that God is building.
[3213.18 → 3223.24] And it is, the church is a sign of his own triumph over the spiritual powers and authorities in the heavenly places.
[3223.82 → 3232.28] And it's a foretaste of what God is doing in the world to unite all things in heaven and on earth in Christ.
[3233.48 → 3235.12] Did you know that you are all of that?
[3235.12 → 3242.34] That means what we are doing here matters a lot.
[3242.76 → 3246.68] Not because of us, but because of what God intends for the church.
[3247.04 → 3250.82] We are the sign of his triumph over the powers.
[3251.22 → 3254.90] We are a foretaste of what he is doing, he will do in all the world.
[3254.90 → 3261.26] Now, as we look at this passage this morning, I want to begin by asking you two questions.
[3262.34 → 3264.60] And I ask you to really engage with them.
[3265.58 → 3267.66] They are two big questions.
[3268.90 → 3272.08] First, we'll have it on the screen.
[3272.54 → 3277.18] If you could experience one thing, what would it be?
[3278.28 → 3281.24] What's the best thing to experience?
[3281.24 → 3287.14] Some of us might think of winning a gold medal in the Olympics.
[3287.92 → 3290.84] We might think that would just be the most amazing experience.
[3292.34 → 3298.78] Some of us might think someone saying that they love you would be the most amazing experience.
[3299.96 → 3302.82] My wife Christy and I have always wanted to live in Switzerland.
[3303.60 → 3303.82] Right?
[3303.88 → 3306.74] To ski and to hike in the Alps and swim in the lakes.
[3306.74 → 3313.10] So given your personality, what would be the best thing to experience?
[3314.54 → 3316.00] Now here's the second question.
[3317.56 → 3321.22] If you could know one thing, what would it be?
[3322.90 → 3326.66] What is the most important thing to know?
[3327.68 → 3329.80] Well, maybe it depends on your circumstances.
[3329.80 → 3335.22] Once when I was a kid, I had built a tree fort, tree house in the woods.
[3336.52 → 3341.32] And I was up there, and I thought, you know, it would be really cool to light a candle.
[3342.58 → 3344.78] And I put the candle a little too close to the wall.
[3344.78 → 3353.10] And that candle, which at one moment was just creating this very cool vibe and caught the wall on fire.
[3353.32 → 3355.60] And the flames slowly started to spread.
[3356.12 → 3361.26] And at that moment, what I most wanted to know was where is the nearest garden hose?
[3362.92 → 3367.70] Now I ask these questions because truly this is what Paul is talking about this morning.
[3367.70 → 3379.92] What is the one great experience, whatever your personality, and the one great thing to know, whatever your circumstances.
[3380.88 → 3384.36] And you may have noticed that this passage is actually a prayer.
[3385.48 → 3389.66] Paul says, for this reason, I kneel before the Father.
[3390.82 → 3392.98] And so we know that this is a passionate prayer.
[3393.26 → 3396.52] Because usually people in those days prayed how?
[3396.52 → 3398.56] He actually prayed standing.
[3399.88 → 3402.74] So to kneel was always a sign of great emotion.
[3403.54 → 3410.16] In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus knelt to pray on the night before his crucifixion.
[3410.96 → 3412.78] So Paul is deeply moved.
[3412.92 → 3414.64] He's kneeling before God.
[3415.20 → 3420.04] And he is praying something for these new believers in the church in Ephesus.
[3421.24 → 3423.82] But not only does Paul pray with this great passion,
[3423.82 → 3426.42] he also prays with great confidence.
[3427.40 → 3430.96] You know, there are lots of times when we have to say,
[3431.60 → 3434.30] if it is your will, God, at the end of a prayer.
[3434.32 → 3437.22] Because we don't really know if it's God's will or not.
[3437.58 → 3440.12] So we pray, and we say, this is what I'm praying for.
[3440.34 → 3441.30] Lord, if it is your will.
[3441.30 → 3450.66] But there are lots of things that we absolutely know is God's will for every single Christian.
[3451.66 → 3458.22] So if you are a believer in Christ, I know that, and if I know that to be the case,
[3458.22 → 3463.28] that you are a believer in Christ, I can pray for lots of things for you with confidence.
[3463.28 → 3468.64] Because God has already said in his word that this is his will for you.
[3468.64 → 3473.26] So I can look at any Christian here, you know, I can just pick Jack.
[3473.82 → 3476.74] And I can, looking at Jack, I can go home this afternoon,
[3477.00 → 3484.36] and I can say, Lord, I pray that Jack would be strengthened with power through the Holy Spirit in his inner being.
[3484.36 → 3491.74] I'm praying something for what that I already know God wants, and that God will do.
[3492.68 → 3494.80] And so I can pray that with great confidence.
[3495.92 → 3502.16] I can pray something that is not God's will with all the passion and energy in the world,
[3502.60 → 3504.62] and it will accomplish nothing.
[3505.54 → 3512.06] But I can pray one simple prayer, led by the Holy Spirit, according to the promises of God's word,
[3512.06 → 3516.52] that one of you here would be strengthened by God's power this week,
[3516.90 → 3520.72] just to live the life that God has called you to be his witness in the world,
[3520.94 → 3523.76] and that can happen.
[3524.32 → 3525.60] God will answer that prayer.
[3526.12 → 3530.56] Because God has already said that's something he wants to happen.
[3532.08 → 3537.54] So Paul's prayer, as we listen to these prayers, are not vague hopes and wishes.
[3537.54 → 3541.44] He is kneeling before the Father of us all,
[3541.58 → 3547.36] who promises that he will do and accomplish what Paul is praying for us in this passage.
[3547.80 → 3550.24] So now let's look at what this prayer says.
[3551.72 → 3553.76] And we're just going to look at these two things.
[3553.90 → 3559.18] First, Paul prays, asking that his friends might have an experience.
[3560.78 → 3565.32] It's a prayer for one great experience.
[3565.32 → 3568.24] Now what is the experience that Paul is praised for?
[3568.34 → 3571.44] Let's look at the passage, verse 16.
[3572.24 → 3576.08] If you have a Bible in a pew, you're welcome to open it up.
[3576.12 → 3576.90] I don't have the page number.
[3577.46 → 3579.76] But we are in Ephesians chapter 3.
[3580.18 → 3582.90] And we're in verse 16, but here it is up on the overhead.
[3584.00 → 3584.46] He says,
[3584.46 → 3587.84] See, I pray.
[3588.02 → 3588.42] He's praying.
[3588.80 → 3590.68] I pray that out of his glorious riches,
[3591.28 → 3595.32] he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being,
[3595.68 → 3600.34] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[3600.96 → 3603.44] That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[3603.70 → 3606.72] That is the experience that he prays for.
[3607.56 → 3610.48] Now there are two words in Greek for dwelling.
[3610.78 → 3611.54] This word dwell.
[3611.54 → 3616.12] One means to dwell in a place as a stranger.
[3617.20 → 3619.56] It's the word used of a foreigner like Abraham,
[3620.16 → 3622.36] dwelling in a land not his own.
[3622.86 → 3623.90] That's one word to dwell.
[3624.64 → 3628.24] But the other word means to dwell in the sense of settling down,
[3628.62 → 3631.18] putting down roots, having a permanent home.
[3632.58 → 3634.68] And that is the word that Paul uses here.
[3634.68 → 3635.08] He says,
[3635.16 → 3639.72] I pray that Jesus Christ will settle down in your hearts.
[3639.82 → 3642.02] That he will dwell permanently.
[3642.62 → 3644.56] That he would unpack his bags.
[3644.64 → 3646.10] That he would make himself a home.
[3646.44 → 3651.68] That he would put down roots in your heart through faith.
[3652.86 → 3654.52] Now, dwell in your hearts.
[3654.60 → 3657.06] That's very religious kind of language.
[3657.34 → 3659.60] We know, as Christians, we know what that means, we think.
[3659.60 → 3663.28] But what exactly is this heart that Paul is talking about?
[3663.92 → 3668.26] Well, it's not that fabulously complicated muscle that pumps blood
[3668.26 → 3670.82] and keeps all of your other organs going.
[3671.58 → 3675.66] But what it means is that Christ can be present
[3675.66 → 3679.36] at the very deepest part of your inner being.
[3679.94 → 3683.74] The most intimate place that makes you, you.
[3683.74 → 3686.38] That's where Christ dwells.
[3687.66 → 3690.06] And so, we all have memories.
[3690.48 → 3693.04] Where you have memories that are part of you,
[3693.50 → 3698.10] his presence can affect their power over you.
[3699.18 → 3703.28] Where you have a will and volition to act in this world,
[3703.68 → 3707.96] his presence can inform your decisions and choices and priorities.
[3707.96 → 3712.72] Where you generate love,
[3713.90 → 3716.20] his presence can influence what you value
[3716.20 → 3719.10] and what you aspire to and those things that you love.
[3720.44 → 3725.18] Where you judge things to be good and beautiful and true and important,
[3726.02 → 3729.84] his presence can change the way you see the world and see everything in it.
[3731.70 → 3734.40] That's what it means when Christ dwells in your hearts.
[3734.40 → 3738.04] He settles there, puts down deep roots,
[3738.12 → 3742.62] and starts to change everything about who you deeply are.
[3743.32 → 3745.76] I heard this illustration about cucumbers and pickles,
[3746.14 → 3747.50] which I think is helpful.
[3748.26 → 3752.94] With a cucumber, you rinse the cucumber to get the dirt off.
[3753.94 → 3757.54] But when you put that rinsed cucumber into a jar
[3757.54 → 3761.30] with a vinegar solution, with garlic and herbs
[3761.30 → 3764.00] and all this lovely, delicious spices,
[3764.40 → 3766.10] and you put the jar of that lid on.
[3766.52 → 3767.40] The jar of that lid.
[3768.38 → 3770.42] The lid of the jar on.
[3770.86 → 3773.66] And if you leave it there for a while, what happens?
[3774.32 → 3777.88] The cucumber takes on the characteristics of the solution
[3777.88 → 3779.42] into which you put it,
[3779.76 → 3781.58] and it becomes a delicious pickle.
[3783.26 → 3785.68] Now, the image doesn't quite work,
[3785.72 → 3787.18] but if we kind of invert the image,
[3787.52 → 3789.26] the Holy Spirit comes into a person,
[3789.26 → 3791.44] the Holy Spirit is that solution,
[3792.04 → 3794.56] and we start taking on the characteristics
[3794.56 → 3798.16] of the God who came into us.
[3798.60 → 3801.10] He is the solution, kind of from the inside out.
[3801.42 → 3804.06] We begin to become pickles.
[3804.54 → 3805.84] We begin to become Christians.
[3807.22 → 3811.48] Our whole self just becomes transformed
[3811.48 → 3813.90] into something which we were not
[3813.90 → 3816.18] by God's work in us.
[3816.18 → 3818.28] He dwells in our hearts by faith.
[3819.36 → 3821.18] This happens at the centre of who we are.
[3821.28 → 3823.46] And so Paul is praying that every Christian,
[3823.66 → 3825.60] every human being into whom the Holy Spirit
[3825.60 → 3827.56] comes and takes up residence,
[3828.10 → 3830.52] that we would grow in him.
[3831.08 → 3831.30] Right?
[3831.38 → 3834.10] That we would settle down into what it means
[3834.10 → 3836.86] that the Spirit of Christ dwells in our hearts.
[3837.52 → 3841.30] And that we would absorb who he is.
[3841.30 → 3845.62] I have to admit that this is very mysterious.
[3846.70 → 3848.80] But there's no other way to package it.
[3849.84 → 3852.76] But friends, it can be experienced.
[3853.28 → 3854.44] It can be experienced.
[3855.40 → 3857.62] Christ can dwell in your heart by faith.
[3857.92 → 3860.06] And this experience, Paul says,
[3860.14 → 3861.00] is the best,
[3861.16 → 3863.18] no matter what your personality is.
[3863.34 → 3865.02] It is better than winning a gold medal.
[3865.28 → 3866.62] It is better than living in Switzerland.
[3867.62 → 3868.50] Do you believe that?
[3868.50 → 3873.02] And the longer you live with Jesus,
[3873.22 → 3875.06] or the longer Jesus lives in you,
[3875.10 → 3878.24] the more he settles down
[3878.24 → 3880.92] and dwells in every part of your life.
[3882.00 → 3882.72] Transforming you.
[3883.02 → 3884.24] And it's not your own power.
[3884.38 → 3885.60] It's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[3885.72 → 3886.80] We just open ourselves up
[3886.80 → 3889.26] and we cooperate with what the Spirit is doing
[3889.26 → 3890.62] by his grace.
[3891.68 → 3893.14] This is Paul's prayer
[3893.14 → 3895.16] for the Ephesian church.
[3895.26 → 3896.50] And it's Paul's prayer for us.
[3896.56 → 3898.14] And God will do it.
[3898.14 → 3900.16] He promises that this is what he's doing.
[3900.26 → 3901.10] We look at our lives,
[3901.46 → 3901.72] and we're like,
[3901.78 → 3903.12] well, it's kind of taking a while,
[3903.38 → 3904.08] at least for me.
[3905.06 → 3906.14] But God will do it.
[3906.18 → 3907.14] And he is doing it.
[3907.42 → 3909.22] And, you know,
[3909.24 → 3910.18] you can look back at your life
[3910.18 → 3911.60] and you can see the ways you've grown.
[3911.70 → 3914.26] You can see maybe faith you've had
[3914.26 → 3916.52] or struggles you've trusted God for.
[3917.88 → 3918.84] It is not easy,
[3918.98 → 3921.18] but when we come to the end of our lives,
[3921.22 → 3922.12] we'll be glorified,
[3922.34 → 3923.34] and we will become
[3923.34 → 3924.98] completely delicious pickles.
[3925.58 → 3926.54] That's God's promise.
[3926.54 → 3926.94] Amen.
[3927.94 → 3928.38] Now,
[3928.58 → 3929.84] if that's the experience,
[3929.96 → 3930.96] what about the knowledge?
[3932.08 → 3935.36] What is the most important thing to know?
[3936.12 → 3937.72] Let's listen again to Paul's prayer,
[3938.08 → 3940.10] beginning in the second part of verse 17.
[3940.10 → 3943.06] He says,
[3943.06 → 3945.80] I pray that you,
[3946.32 → 3948.84] being rooted and established in love,
[3949.46 → 3950.34] may have power,
[3950.50 → 3952.44] together with all the Lord's holy people,
[3952.86 → 3956.90] to grasp how wide and long and high
[3956.90 → 3958.58] and deep is the love of Christ,
[3959.14 → 3960.42] and to know this love
[3960.42 → 3962.52] that surpasses knowledge,
[3963.16 → 3965.52] that you may be filled to the measure
[3965.52 → 3967.60] of all the fullness of God.
[3967.60 → 3970.04] Here is the knowledge.
[3970.62 → 3971.82] The most important thing to know,
[3971.88 → 3973.22] whatever your circumstances,
[3973.42 → 3975.14] even if your treehouse is on fire,
[3975.52 → 3976.38] this is more important.
[3977.26 → 3978.26] People need to know
[3978.26 → 3979.52] that they are loved by God.
[3980.20 → 3980.60] Right?
[3980.66 → 3982.36] It's like sunlight for tomato plants.
[3982.74 → 3983.44] They know that,
[3983.70 → 3984.32] and they grow,
[3984.86 → 3986.10] and they become delicious tomatoes.
[3986.50 → 3987.32] We're mixing our metaphors.
[3988.78 → 3989.92] People need to know
[3989.92 → 3990.96] that they are loved by God.
[3990.96 → 3993.84] But we also suspect,
[3994.18 → 3995.40] when we think about this,
[3995.50 → 3996.44] that, well,
[3996.66 → 3998.40] we are unloveable.
[3999.40 → 4002.86] If someone really knew us
[4002.86 → 4004.04] at our depths,
[4004.36 → 4005.26] our inner being,
[4005.84 → 4006.70] they would find,
[4007.08 → 4007.34] perhaps,
[4007.48 → 4009.12] a mixture of goodness
[4009.12 → 4011.96] and also toxic selfishness.
[4011.96 → 4016.36] And what a pain that is.
[4017.12 → 4018.62] To need love,
[4018.98 → 4020.50] but to be cut off from it.
[4021.32 → 4021.74] And really,
[4021.86 → 4022.96] all of human pain
[4022.96 → 4024.46] is right here.
[4025.58 → 4027.08] But here's what Paul says.
[4027.74 → 4028.10] He says,
[4028.24 → 4030.32] the solution for our deepest struggles
[4030.32 → 4032.24] is to grasp
[4032.24 → 4034.04] how wide and long
[4034.04 → 4034.92] and high and deep
[4034.92 → 4037.68] is the love of Christ for us.
[4037.68 → 4041.82] When my daughter Ellie
[4041.82 → 4043.98] was three years old,
[4044.70 → 4046.42] I would love to sing her
[4046.42 → 4047.42] the alphabet song
[4047.42 → 4047.98] every night
[4047.98 → 4048.96] before she went to sleep.
[4049.64 → 4051.02] She always asked for a song,
[4051.12 → 4051.66] so I figured,
[4051.78 → 4051.84] well,
[4051.88 → 4052.84] may as well be educational.
[4053.68 → 4054.76] So we sing the alphabet song.
[4054.84 → 4055.14] And of course,
[4055.20 → 4056.42] I sing her other songs as well.
[4056.60 → 4058.10] But she learned her alphabet
[4058.10 → 4059.42] really well,
[4059.58 → 4060.94] just through sheer repetition.
[4062.56 → 4063.90] And before long,
[4063.98 → 4065.20] we noticed her sing
[4065.20 → 4066.80] this interesting little phrase.
[4066.80 → 4068.76] she would use the letter,
[4069.32 → 4070.14] I almost said Z,
[4070.96 → 4071.44] Zed,
[4072.38 → 4073.74] as a superlative
[4073.74 → 4075.30] to say something
[4075.30 → 4076.58] that is the most
[4076.58 → 4077.76] or best.
[4078.04 → 4078.60] So for example,
[4078.70 → 4079.56] she would say things like,
[4079.98 → 4080.68] I am,
[4080.82 → 4081.68] I'll just use Z,
[4081.76 → 4082.22] she said Z.
[4082.78 → 4084.16] I am Z thirsty.
[4085.10 → 4086.00] Or she would say,
[4086.10 → 4087.80] I'm Z tired.
[4088.24 → 4089.46] Or this is Z fun.
[4089.82 → 4090.48] She would say this,
[4090.54 → 4091.46] it's so interesting.
[4092.30 → 4093.06] And so Christy and I
[4093.06 → 4094.10] started to say it too.
[4094.26 → 4095.32] And I would say to Ellie,
[4095.42 → 4095.64] Ellie,
[4095.64 → 4097.38] I love you Z much.
[4098.42 → 4099.58] And she would smile
[4099.58 → 4100.28] and she would say,
[4100.48 → 4100.84] wow,
[4101.54 → 4102.82] that's a lot.
[4104.42 → 4105.82] That's what communicated
[4105.82 → 4106.58] my love to her.
[4106.68 → 4107.68] I reached the extent
[4107.68 → 4108.82] of her knowledge
[4108.82 → 4110.72] to express the measure
[4110.72 → 4111.90] of my love
[4111.90 → 4113.30] for her.
[4114.16 → 4114.86] And friends,
[4114.92 → 4115.54] that is what God
[4115.54 → 4117.02] is doing here for us.
[4118.70 → 4119.90] The love of Jesus
[4119.90 → 4121.22] is wide.
[4121.82 → 4122.70] How wide?
[4122.70 → 4124.02] It means that it stretches
[4124.02 → 4125.12] from horizon
[4125.12 → 4126.00] to horizon.
[4126.64 → 4127.96] That there is no part
[4127.96 → 4128.50] of your life
[4128.50 → 4129.24] that God's love
[4129.24 → 4130.18] cannot reach.
[4130.98 → 4132.10] Everything must come
[4132.10 → 4133.04] under the width
[4133.04 → 4133.84] of God's love.
[4134.78 → 4135.82] And God in his grace
[4135.82 → 4136.84] can accept you
[4136.84 → 4137.56] and love you
[4137.56 → 4139.40] for who you are,
[4139.70 → 4140.44] where you are,
[4140.52 → 4140.98] but of course,
[4141.04 → 4142.18] because he loves you,
[4142.72 → 4144.30] he will not leave you
[4144.30 → 4145.26] where you are.
[4145.44 → 4146.54] Everything must come
[4146.54 → 4147.22] under the love.
[4147.22 → 4149.30] And we're told
[4149.30 → 4149.98] that God's love
[4149.98 → 4150.74] is long.
[4151.30 → 4152.12] That means it reaches
[4152.12 → 4153.20] back in time
[4153.20 → 4153.80] and it reaches
[4153.80 → 4155.22] ahead in time.
[4156.16 → 4156.80] He has seen
[4156.80 → 4158.28] everything in your past.
[4158.46 → 4159.24] He knows it all.
[4159.74 → 4160.62] He knows everything
[4160.62 → 4161.50] that is in store
[4161.50 → 4162.44] for you in your future
[4162.44 → 4163.92] and he loves you.
[4164.34 → 4165.68] Nothing in your story
[4165.68 → 4166.36] means that God
[4166.36 → 4167.14] cannot love you.
[4167.92 → 4169.28] There are no secrets
[4169.28 → 4169.94] from him.
[4170.62 → 4172.28] So when he proclaims
[4172.28 → 4173.04] his love to you,
[4173.04 → 4174.22] you can try to tell
[4174.22 → 4175.58] yourselves that,
[4175.86 → 4176.14] you know,
[4176.14 → 4177.76] yeah, but he wouldn't
[4177.76 → 4179.18] love me if he knew
[4179.18 → 4180.20] about this thing.
[4180.92 → 4182.16] But that doesn't work
[4182.16 → 4183.52] because he does
[4183.52 → 4184.34] know about it
[4184.34 → 4186.00] and he still proclaims
[4186.00 → 4186.66] his love for you.
[4187.70 → 4189.30] And we have the power
[4189.30 → 4191.16] to grasp how God's love
[4191.16 → 4192.18] is high.
[4193.14 → 4194.12] That means nothing
[4194.12 → 4195.20] can get over it.
[4195.30 → 4196.56] Nothing is bigger
[4196.56 → 4197.72] than the love of God.
[4198.34 → 4199.44] Every other love
[4199.44 → 4201.24] actually finds its glory
[4201.24 → 4202.22] as a reflection
[4202.22 → 4204.60] of the love of God.
[4204.60 → 4204.80] God.
[4205.48 → 4206.88] Every healthy love
[4206.88 → 4207.58] is trying to
[4207.58 → 4209.34] become more like
[4209.34 → 4210.78] that love of God
[4210.78 → 4212.66] or it's not healthy love.
[4213.80 → 4215.14] And we are to experience
[4215.14 → 4216.42] how God's love is deep.
[4216.92 → 4217.70] That means that
[4217.70 → 4218.98] nothing can get under it.
[4219.10 → 4219.80] His love goes
[4219.80 → 4220.74] to the deepest needs
[4220.74 → 4221.98] and pains of our existence.
[4222.46 → 4223.28] His love is deeper
[4223.28 → 4224.28] than our sins.
[4224.82 → 4226.48] It reaches all the way down.
[4226.82 → 4227.76] And if we desire
[4227.76 → 4228.84] also a foundation,
[4229.46 → 4230.64] something unshakeable
[4230.64 → 4232.60] in this sharable world,
[4232.60 → 4234.70] it is God's love
[4234.70 → 4235.56] where we can find this.
[4235.64 → 4236.90] It reaches so deep down
[4236.90 → 4238.12] we can stand upon it
[4238.12 → 4239.32] and be solid.
[4239.52 → 4240.46] We can stand firmly
[4240.46 → 4241.38] on the love of God
[4241.38 → 4242.44] when everything else
[4242.44 → 4243.34] around us is shaking.
[4244.70 → 4245.50] God says,
[4245.74 → 4246.38] that is how much
[4246.38 → 4247.12] I love you.
[4247.20 → 4248.46] I love you Z much.
[4248.74 → 4250.26] How wide and long
[4250.26 → 4251.18] and high and deep.
[4252.22 → 4253.58] And knowledge of this love
[4253.58 → 4254.78] comes with the dwelling
[4254.78 → 4256.26] of Christ in our hearts.
[4256.76 → 4258.10] This love is what
[4258.10 → 4259.16] we were created for.
[4259.16 → 4260.92] And so Paul,
[4261.04 → 4262.32] who has tasted this himself,
[4263.60 → 4264.94] prays it for the church.
[4266.36 → 4267.30] He prays that we would be
[4267.30 → 4268.80] filled to the measure
[4268.80 → 4270.58] of all the fullness of God
[4270.58 → 4272.16] to experience God's spirit
[4272.16 → 4273.34] dwelling in our hearts
[4273.34 → 4274.36] and transforming us
[4274.36 → 4275.58] and that we would know
[4275.58 → 4276.22] Christ's love
[4276.22 → 4277.46] and surpass his knowledge.
[4279.00 → 4280.20] Now I want to close
[4280.20 → 4281.72] by sharing this stanza
[4281.72 → 4282.40] from a hymn
[4282.40 → 4283.36] that I really love.
[4283.42 → 4284.02] It's a hymn about
[4284.02 → 4284.86] the love of God.
[4285.74 → 4286.76] So the hymn is called
[4286.76 → 4287.38] The Love of God
[4287.38 → 4288.16] is Great or Far.
[4288.16 → 4290.86] Maybe you're familiar with it.
[4290.96 → 4291.74] I couldn't find
[4291.74 → 4292.58] there a great hymnal though.
[4293.34 → 4294.46] Anyway, here's what it says.
[4296.52 → 4299.16] Could we with ink
[4299.16 → 4300.84] the ocean fill,
[4301.06 → 4302.02] you have to use your imagination,
[4302.16 → 4303.12] ocean filled with ink,
[4303.58 → 4304.38] and where the skies
[4304.38 → 4305.70] of parchments made,
[4306.22 → 4307.80] where every stock on earth
[4307.80 → 4308.52] a quill,
[4309.14 → 4310.02] and every one
[4310.02 → 4311.68] a scribe by trade,
[4312.10 → 4314.88] to write the love of God above
[4314.88 → 4316.76] would drain the ocean dry,
[4316.76 → 4318.70] nor could the scroll
[4318.70 → 4320.10] contain the whole
[4320.10 → 4321.30] that was stretched
[4321.30 → 4323.04] from sky to sky.
[4324.26 → 4325.08] That's how big
[4325.08 → 4326.10] God's love is for us.
[4326.72 → 4327.20] Praise him.
[4327.76 → 4328.24] Let's pray.
[4331.96 → 4333.10] Father, we thank you
[4333.10 → 4336.52] for this lens,
[4337.32 → 4338.38] this word
[4338.38 → 4340.84] from the Apostle Paul
[4340.84 → 4341.82] writing from prison,
[4341.82 → 4343.88] telling us
[4343.88 → 4346.70] about his prayer
[4346.70 → 4347.86] for us,
[4348.38 → 4348.70] the church,
[4348.78 → 4349.60] that we would be filled
[4349.60 → 4350.78] with the fullness of Christ.
[4352.04 → 4352.44] Father,
[4352.52 → 4353.20] that we would know
[4353.20 → 4353.98] your love for us.
[4354.24 → 4355.58] This is the most important thing
[4355.58 → 4356.46] any of us need,
[4356.86 → 4358.40] to be filled with Christ,
[4358.74 → 4359.80] to know the love of God.
[4360.34 → 4360.58] Lord,
[4360.62 → 4361.64] would you make it so
[4361.64 → 4362.40] in our lives
[4362.40 → 4363.84] increasingly by measure.
[4364.82 → 4365.14] Lord,
[4365.14 → 4366.06] we pray for the work
[4366.06 → 4366.56] of your spirit
[4366.56 → 4367.36] in each one of us.
[4367.44 → 4368.46] We pray for the church
[4368.46 → 4369.56] of all the things
[4369.56 → 4370.12] we could pray.
[4371.60 → 4372.44] This is what we need
[4372.44 → 4373.68] to pray for one another,
[4373.86 → 4374.72] that we would know
[4374.72 → 4375.48] the love of God,
[4375.80 → 4376.76] that we would be filled
[4376.76 → 4377.36] with the dwelling
[4377.36 → 4377.90] of the spirit.
[4378.64 → 4378.94] So Lord,
[4378.98 → 4379.98] we do pray it for us.
[4380.80 → 4381.16] And Lord,
[4381.20 → 4381.74] would you do it
[4381.74 → 4382.70] because it is your will.
[4383.30 → 4384.38] We pray in his holy name.
[4384.52 → 4384.72] Amen.
[4384.72 → 4387.68] I invite you to stand
[4387.68 → 4388.86] and we'll sing together.
[4389.00 → 4389.88] Shout to the Lord,
[4390.20 → 4390.86] my Jesus,
[4391.02 → 4391.62] my Saviour,
[4391.80 → 4392.06] Lord,
[4392.18 → 4393.24] there is none like you.
[4393.60 → 4394.62] All of my days,
[4394.72 → 4395.68] I want to praise
[4395.68 → 4396.36] the wonders
[4396.36 → 4398.22] of your mighty love.
[4398.22 → 4423.74] all of my days,
[4423.74 → 4426.70] I want to praise
[4426.70 → 4427.96] the wonders
[4427.96 → 4431.70] of your mighty love.
[4434.98 → 4436.94] I comfort,
[4438.30 → 4439.84] I shelter,
[4440.46 → 4442.80] power of refuge
[4442.80 → 4444.44] and strength,
[4444.90 → 4447.06] that every breath,
[4447.78 → 4450.08] all that I am,
[4450.08 → 4456.02] never cease to worship you.
[4456.70 → 4459.58] shout to the Lord,
[4459.58 → 4462.32] all the earth and sea,
[4462.98 → 4465.52] power and majesty,
[4465.52 → 4468.52] praise to the King,
[4468.52 → 4470.80] mountain bow down
[4470.80 → 4473.46] and the seas will hold
[4473.46 → 4478.70] up the sun of your name.
[4478.70 → 4481.58] I sing for joy
[4481.58 → 4484.92] and the work of your hands.
[4484.92 → 4487.82] Forever I'll love you,
[4487.90 → 4489.92] forever I'll sing.
[4490.92 → 4494.80] Nothing compares to the promise
[4494.80 → 4499.02] I have in you.
[4499.02 → 4505.12] my Jesus,
[4505.12 → 4508.02] my Saviour,
[4508.02 → 4509.12] Lord,
[4509.22 → 4511.90] there is none like you.
[4511.90 → 4514.78] all of my days,
[4514.78 → 4517.78] I want to praise
[4517.78 → 4522.78] the wonders of your mighty love.
[4522.78 → 4527.78] my comfort,
[4527.78 → 4528.78] my comfort,
[4528.78 → 4530.78] my shelter,
[4530.78 → 4534.78] tower of refuge and strength,
[4534.78 → 4537.78] let every breath,
[4537.78 → 4540.78] all that I am,
[4540.78 → 4545.60] never cease to worship you.
[4545.60 → 4547.48] I sing for joy
[4547.48 → 4550.48] and the Lord,
[4550.48 → 4552.48] all the earth,
[4552.48 → 4554.14] let us sing.
[4554.14 → 4557.34] Power and majesty,
[4557.62 → 4560.24] praise to the King,
[4560.24 → 4562.70] mountains bow down
[4562.70 → 4565.46] and the seas will hold
[4565.46 → 4571.78] at the sun of your name.
[4571.78 → 4573.98] I sing for joy
[4573.98 → 4576.92] and the work of your hands.
[4577.46 → 4579.82] Forever I'll love you,
[4579.92 → 4582.40] forever I'll stand.
[4583.20 → 4586.68] Nothing compares to the promise
[4586.68 → 4616.66] I'll love you,
[4616.66 → 4617.78] our offering,
[4617.96 → 4618.76] designated offering today
[4618.76 → 4620.74] is for Service Anonymous.
[4621.30 → 4622.84] There are a foundation
[4622.84 → 4624.78] that helps women
[4624.78 → 4626.74] who have been victims
[4626.74 → 4627.96] of sex trafficking
[4627.96 → 4629.80] get back on their feet,
[4629.94 → 4631.12] find healing and hope
[4631.12 → 4633.64] and feel loader.
[4633.80 → 4634.44] We remember him,
[4634.52 → 4635.60] he's come and preached for us.
[4635.72 → 4637.62] He works with this organization
[4637.62 → 4639.38] and so it's also an organization
[4639.38 → 4640.64] that we like to support
[4640.64 → 4641.40] as a church
[4641.40 → 4643.60] and so I'll ask the deacons
[4643.60 → 4644.34] to come forward
[4644.34 → 4645.48] and collect the offering.
[4646.66 → 4672.28] Back to Break the
[4672.28 → 4702.26] Thank you.
[4702.28 → 4732.26] Thank you.
[4732.28 → 4762.26] Thank you.
[4762.28 → 4763.92] Let's pray.
[4792.28 → 4800.36] And Lord, send out the good news of your Son from this church, that many would come to know you.
[4800.86 → 4802.06] Lord, in your mercy.
[4802.06 → 4816.32] Father, whatever the hurts and the pains, whatever the hopes that each one of us here carries this day, we yield them up to you.
[4816.32 → 4822.54] We give you our lives as the greatest offering, the true offering.
[4823.38 → 4825.06] May they be acceptable to you.
[4825.06 → 4831.48] And give to us an increase of faith, hope, and love through your Spirit at work within us.
[4832.34 → 4837.20] Grant to us the eyes of faith that know deeply the love of Christ for us.
[4837.20 → 4842.34] And would your love heal our deepest wounds and satisfy our deepest longings.
[4843.48 → 4846.90] And Lord, grant to us that our hearts would be your dwelling place.
[4847.54 → 4853.66] That dwelling in us, that you would change us and transform us into your own image and likeness.
[4854.06 → 4858.54] That we may glorify you in every area of our lives.
[4858.54 → 4861.82] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4863.24 → 4868.58] Father, we thank you so much for our basic skills camp that was such a great success last week.
[4868.58 → 4877.28] We praise you that so many children were able to come and not only have a great time, but also hear the gospel and to know God's love for them.
[4878.10 → 4882.40] Holy Spirit, would you be at work in each of their hearts.
[4882.92 → 4886.34] And we pray, Jesus, that you would indeed be their good shepherd.
[4887.14 → 4890.30] That they would hear your voice and follow you.
[4890.30 → 4899.00] We thank you for all the volunteers and helpers who put in so much time and effort and commitment to serve the children who came to the camp.
[4899.38 → 4905.04] To be your hands and feet and words to help form these little ones to know you.
[4905.78 → 4911.14] We pray that through their service, that they might, these volunteers, have grown in their own faith.
[4911.88 → 4914.66] And experienced you working through them as they served.
[4915.08 → 4917.60] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4917.60 → 4926.98] And Lord, also this morning we remember Fowl, who I heard recently also has continued to have some health struggles.
[4928.24 → 4932.26] Father, we pray continually for little Richie, Rick and Roberta's grandson.
[4933.38 → 4942.84] We pray, Lord God, that you would give both Fowl and little Richie help in their journeys in this world at whatever stage they are at.
[4942.84 → 4946.96] That you would give her and him complete and full health.
[4947.66 → 4951.94] And that you would give help and stamina to their families.
[4952.42 → 4954.82] That you would be in ever-present health in times of trouble.
[4956.08 → 4957.96] Jesus, we lift these prayers to you.
[4958.66 → 4963.94] Mindful that you are able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through you.
[4964.78 → 4967.42] Since you always live to make intercession for us.
[4968.14 → 4971.28] We place our trust and confidence in you.
[4971.28 → 4977.36] And we pray all of these things in your name, O Lord Jesus, our priest forever.
[4978.18 → 4978.56] Amen.
[4980.18 → 4981.34] Would you all please rise?
[4983.44 → 4988.40] And right after our benediction and our closing song, I invite you to join us for our time of fellowship.
[4989.14 → 4991.36] Right outside through the doors in the fellowship room.
[4991.36 → 4998.34] Now I invite you to hold out your hands and I will be using as the blessing Ephesians 3 verses 20 to 21.
[4998.52 → 5000.16] Which is this great benediction.
[5001.32 → 5005.98] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.
[5006.48 → 5009.60] According to his power that is at work within us.
[5010.18 → 5011.92] To him be glory in the church.
[5012.34 → 5014.52] And in Christ Jesus throughout all generations.
[5015.32 → 5016.40] Forever and ever.
[5016.96 → 5017.28] Amen.
[5017.28 → 5017.38] Amen.
[5017.38 → 5017.40] Amen.

[5040.90 → 5042.02] Amen.
[5042.02 → 5042.24] Amen.
[5042.24 → 5042.64] Amen.
[5042.64 → 5044.62] Amen.
[5044.62 → 5048.46] Amen.
[5048.48 → 5049.46] Amen.
[5049.46 → 5049.70] Amen.
