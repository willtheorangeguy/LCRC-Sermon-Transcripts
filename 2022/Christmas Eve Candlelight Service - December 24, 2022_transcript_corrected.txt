[1567.74 → 1577.80] that has been made. When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, I am the light of the world.
[1578.30 → 1585.70] Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[1589.62 → 1601.30] Jesus is the true light of the world, and he entered into the darkness of our sinful and broken world.
[1601.30 → 1606.90] The Christmas story is full of light from the light of the angels who appeared to the shepherds
[1606.90 → 1613.96] to the light of the star that the magi followed in order to find Jesus. At Christmas, we worship
[1613.96 → 1619.56] Jesus as the light who shines in the darkness and gives light to all the nations.

[2307.50 → 2313.26] prefer the darkness and in an act of amazing grace Jesus descends into the
[2313.26 → 2325.76] darkness for us so that we might know the light of God's presence from noon
[2325.76 → 2333.64] until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land about three in the
[2333.64 → 2338.76] afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice Eli
[2338.76 → 2353.30] lemma sabachthani which means my god why have you forsaken me even though
[2353.30 → 2357.56] we have rejected the light of God's presence Jesus the light of the world
[2357.56 → 2363.34] entered into the darkness for us on the cross he experienced the for darkness of
[2363.34 → 2369.08] rejection from God the father turned his face away from his son leaving him in
[2369.08 → 2374.84] utter darkness Jesus endured the deepest darkness so that we might know the light
[2374.84 → 2380.62] of God's presence he triumphed over the darkness so that the curse of sin might
[2380.62 → 2383.62] be defeated
[2410.62 → 2415.62] but
[2415.62 → 2416.62] remember
[2416.62 → 2417.62] but
[2417.62 → 2419.40] so

[2525.60 → 2527.60] Is a big joy
[2527.60 → 2557.18] God shines his light upon us.
[2557.60 → 2565.96] God uses light and is tied to light in amazing ways all through God's grand story.
[2565.96 → 2572.12] When we encounter God's saving grace through faith, we prefer Jesus rather than the darkness
[2572.12 → 2580.92] and God shines God's light upon us.
[2580.92 → 2589.02] May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine upon us so that your ways
[2589.02 → 2594.20] may be known on earth, your salvation among the nations.
[2594.20 → 2596.92] May peoples praise you, God.
[2596.92 → 2603.92] May all the peoples praise you.
[2603.92 → 2610.04] The psalmist prayed that the light of God's face would shine upon God's people so that
[2610.04 → 2615.06] God's people might in turn shine God's light to the world.
[2615.06 → 2620.66] Jesus tells us that we are the light of the world, and we are to make known God's goodness
[2620.66 → 2622.92] to everyone we meet.
[2622.92 → 2629.92] May God help us each day to be a light in this dark world.
[2629.92 → 2636.92] God bless you.

[2705.86 → 2711.20] His love is here.
[2711.20 → 2718.56] Have you heard the news that they bring from heaven
[2718.56 → 2727.52] to the humble shepherds who have waited long?
[2727.52 → 2737.22] Gloria, and it shall cease to be.
[2737.22 → 2743.22] Angels sing their trifle song.
[2743.22 → 2759.22] He is in the winter's day nest, like a gentle snow flower.
[2759.22 → 2767.22] In a gentle night, he is coming joy.
[2767.22 → 2773.92] At the sun and morning, we'll be on the moon.
[2773.92 → 2775.92] We'll be on the moon.
[2775.92 → 2779.92] He is coming joy.
[2779.92 → 2787.92] So may life, the truth of the Mary,
[2787.92 → 2796.92] in simple stable, may I see this way.
[2796.92 → 2800.92] We are all Jesus' dear.
[2800.92 → 2804.92] Gloria, and it shall cease to be.
[2804.92 → 2814.92] We are all Jesus' dear.
[2814.92 → 2822.92] We bring new light to the world in darkness.
[2822.92 → 2831.92] And the bright stars shining in the skies above.
[2831.92 → 2839.92] Who bring new light to the bay of the M PARKING.
[2839.92 → 2843.12] And the true light to the sun.
[2843.12 → 2846.92] Let you pray.
[2846.92 → 2849.92] Dear Ancient era,
[2849.92 → 2854.92] solos of the Saviour's adding,
[2854.92 → 2860.12] And the mountains and the mountains
[2860.12 → 2864.32] are all the way.
[2865.12 → 2868.72] Glory on in the chassis' name.
[2869.12 → 2872.82] Glory on in the chassis' name.
[2873.82 → 2878.72] Angels sing in Christ's glory.
[2878.72 → 2887.92] Angels sing in Christ's glory.
[2908.72 → 2922.72] Angels sing in Christ's glory.
[2924.72 → 2931.92] Angels sing in Christ's glory.
[2931.92 → 2955.72] The light of heaven.
[2955.72 → 2963.14] God uses light and is tied to light in amazing ways all through God's grand story.
[2964.80 → 2966.32] God creates light.
[2967.06 → 2968.04] God is light.
[2968.74 → 2971.00] God sends God's light to the nations.
[2971.78 → 2974.02] And Jesus came as the light.
[2975.08 → 2979.82] In Christ, we experience God's shining God's light upon us,
[2979.82 → 2984.44] and we long for the day when God will bring God's redemption plan to fullness.
[2984.44 → 2989.22] In that day, we will forever be in the light of heaven.
[2994.56 → 2997.90] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[2998.46 → 3001.70] For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
[3002.36 → 3004.44] and there was no longer any sea.
[3005.20 → 3010.58] I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
[3010.90 → 3014.42] prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
[3014.44 → 3022.46] I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[3023.32 → 3027.88] The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it,
[3028.24 → 3033.78] for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
[3035.08 → 3041.10] The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of earth will bring their splendour into it.
[3041.10 → 3049.24] On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
[3049.24 → 3057.58] One day, night will be no more.
[3058.12 → 3062.68] The darkness of our land and broken world will forever be done away with.
[3063.08 → 3068.24] In place of darkness, we will enjoy the radiance of God's presence for the rest of time.
[3068.66 → 3071.02] Until that day, we live in hope.
[3071.02 → 3077.72] Light has triumphed over darkness, and we await the day when the light will shine forevermore.
[3078.24 → 3083.62] We leave this place tonight as those who have experienced the light of God's presence,
[3084.12 → 3088.54] and we are sent out as those who are the light of the world.
[3088.54 → 3088.74] Amen.
[3088.74 → 3090.74] Amen.
[3118.74 → 3120.74] Amen.

[3328.74 → 3330.74] Amen.
[3358.74 → 3360.74] Amen.
[3388.74 → 3389.74] Let's pray together.
[3391.50 → 3394.74] Our Heavenly Father, we do proclaim your glory.
[3395.44 → 3399.24] You are the God of light and life, and yet you humbled yourself.
[3400.14 → 3403.74] You did not consider equality with God something to be held onto.
[3404.44 → 3405.74] But Lord, you came.
[3406.54 → 3408.74] You were born among us as one of us.
[3409.54 → 3417.74] That you might stand in our place and that you might bring us to God through your death, your resurrection, and your ascension.
[3417.74 → 3421.20] Lord, we thank you for being here with each one of us tonight.
[3421.98 → 3430.42] Lord, we pray that each one of us would, by your grace in us, make room in our hearts to worship you, to receive you.
[3430.94 → 3438.94] And Lord, for those of us who have friends and family who are maybe stuck in airports or stuck in hotels or on the road,
[3439.02 → 3442.34] Lord, would you be with them and help them continue on their journey?
[3442.34 → 3448.42] Lord, be with each one of us tonight as we go home and as we prepare to worship you tomorrow.
[3448.68 → 3449.70] We pray in Jesus' name.
[3450.00 → 3450.20] Amen.
[3451.56 → 3454.42] So, friends, thank you so much for worshipping with us this evening.
[3454.82 → 3460.30] We do actually have a worship service tomorrow at 1030, Christmas Day, Sunday.
[3460.30 → 3465.22] So, we will be worshipping here, and I invite you to join with us tomorrow at 1030.
[3466.08 → 3473.82] Now, as we prepare to go out, hear these words of blessing and benediction from our Heavenly Father spoken over us.
[3474.14 → 3477.94] I invite you to hold out your hands and receive God's good word.
[3477.94 → 3489.50] May the joy of the angels, the eagerness of the shepherds, the wonder of Mary, the peace of the Christ child be yours this Christmas.
[3490.58 → 3497.40] And may the blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be upon you and remain with you now and forever.
[3497.94 → 3498.24] Amen.
[3499.00 → 3502.30] And let's stay standing, and we'll sing our final song, Silent Night.
[3507.94 → 3508.94] Amen.
[3508.94 → 3509.94] Amen.

[3616.12 → 3624.58] Son of God, love's good night.
[3624.58 → 3632.98] Rain and peace from thy holy face,
