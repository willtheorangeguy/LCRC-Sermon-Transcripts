[1439.70 --> 1469.68]  Thank you.
[1469.68 --> 1499.66]  Thank you.
[1499.66 --> 1529.64]  God.
[1529.66 --> 1559.64]  Thank you.
[1559.64 --> 1589.62]  Thank you.
[1589.62 --> 1619.62]  Thank you.
[1619.62 --> 1649.60]  Thank you.
[1649.60 --> 1679.58]  Thank you.
[1679.58 --> 1709.56]  Thank you.
[1709.56 --> 1739.54]  Thank you.
[1739.54 --> 1769.52]  Thank you.
[1769.52 --> 1799.50]  Thank you.
[1799.52 --> 1829.50]  Thank you.
[1829.52 --> 1859.50]  Thank you.
[1859.52 --> 1889.50]  Thank you.
[1889.52 --> 1919.50]  Thank you.
[1919.52 --> 1949.50]  Thank you.
[1949.52 --> 1979.50]  Thank you.
[1979.52 --> 2009.50]  I'm going to read.
[2009.50 --> 2039.48]  Thank you.
[2039.48 --> 2069.46]  Thank you.
[2069.46 --> 2099.44]  Let's pray.
[2099.44 --> 2129.44]  Thank you.
[2129.44 --> 2159.42]  Thank you.
[2159.42 --> 2189.40]  So, you know, you're going to do, you know,
[2189.40 --> 2219.38]  and what you're going to do, you know, you're going to do, you know, and you're going to do, you know,
[2219.38 --> 2220.38]  and cent you're going to do a, you know, if they're moving in, you see, and you're going through,
[2228.64 --> 2230.16]  you're going to do at, you know, and you're doing, you know, you're moving in, you're going to transform, you know, you're saying, "' swap, and you're doing things, they're, okay, you're doing, right, but you're facing, you know, you're going to do,eros Hey, you're sitting now, you're
[2230.16 --> 2244.38] 해�干, you're doing, and you're doing, you're going to do things on the 지�, but you're moving, okay, you're doing, you're doing, you're doing it, and you're going to do, and you're doing, you're taking, yeah.
[2244.38 --> 2248.04]  So all we have to do, anytime we want, wherever we are,
[2248.04 --> 2251.64]  and if we have a data plan, is we press the button,
[2251.64 --> 2254.60]  and in that app, we have everything we need.
[2254.60 --> 2257.80]  Except, you know what, about these maps, there's no scale.
[2259.00 --> 2263.06]  There is also no compass rows.
[2263.06 --> 2266.60]  And you actually don't need an external reference point,
[2266.60 --> 2268.60]  because the reference point is what?
[2270.74 --> 2271.88]  Me.
[2271.88 --> 2272.64]  It's you.
[2272.64 --> 2276.82]  Because on my map, I am the center of the world.
[2276.82 --> 2279.98]  And it's from here, with myself as the reference point,
[2279.98 --> 2281.82]  myself as the standard,
[2281.82 --> 2285.32]  that I make sense of what direction I am moving.
[2285.32 --> 2289.32]  And then I try to discern if I'm moving toward my goal.
[2291.16 --> 2295.44]  Now, I don't intend to ever start carrying a paper map with me
[2295.44 --> 2296.90]  wherever I go.
[2296.90 --> 2301.14]  But in many ways, the change in how we use maps,
[2301.14 --> 2306.32]  and how we navigate in our world offers a kind of decent analogy or a parable
[2306.32 --> 2310.48]  for some of the larger shifts going on in our cultural life,
[2310.82 --> 2315.52]  and in particular, in the ways that we imagine and live out our moral lives.
[2316.32 --> 2320.66]  You see, for most of human history, most of the world even today,
[2320.66 --> 2324.84]  when we think of what it means to pursue what is good,
[2324.84 --> 2329.18]  or to live the good life or to be or to become good,
[2329.18 --> 2334.32]  there's always this external reference point that sets the standard.
[2335.32 --> 2340.60]  It determines the end goal and even the way of how you're going to get there.
[2340.60 --> 2343.84]  And you live your life according to this external reality.
[2343.84 --> 2350.02]  The goodness is out there, and I need to orient my life and live in the world
[2350.02 --> 2354.02]  in such a way as to live accordingly and to reach that goal.
[2355.86 --> 2359.18]  And in that standard, this external reference point,
[2359.18 --> 2366.00]  in many ways, offers both affirmation and critique of us on our journey.
[2366.00 --> 2370.54]  It shows us when we're moving in the wrong direction or the right direction.
[2370.54 --> 2376.38]  And it invites us to keep moving to what the goal of goodness actually is.
[2377.54 --> 2381.04]  And many would say that in our current cultural moment,
[2381.16 --> 2385.52]  we are in the height of what is often called expressive individualism.
[2386.30 --> 2388.96]  And that's just a way of saying that we are all being formed
[2388.96 --> 2393.98]  to live under this never-ending and often very self-defeating task
[2393.98 --> 2397.74]  of constructing our own moralities, right?
[2397.74 --> 2399.82]  Of defining what goodness is.
[2400.54 --> 2405.54]  Coming up with our own visions of the good life for ourselves,
[2405.54 --> 2408.76]  with ourselves, as the reference point.
[2409.30 --> 2413.56]  With our feelings, our thoughts, and our own definitions of what is good.
[2415.50 --> 2420.28]  But friends, to be a Christian means that we don't try to create
[2420.28 --> 2422.96]  our own ideas of what goodness is.
[2423.32 --> 2426.12]  But rather, we try to live in reference to God
[2426.12 --> 2428.86]  and what He tells us goodness is.
[2428.86 --> 2429.86]  Right?
[2429.86 --> 2434.98]  To be a Christian is to be called into a particular way of living in the world
[2434.98 --> 2436.56]  with Jesus.
[2437.62 --> 2442.36]  And with and towards a particular goal of following Jesus.
[2442.46 --> 2444.62]  Jesus says, follow me.
[2444.62 --> 2450.22]  So that's what we're going to explore this morning from this passage, Micah 6.
[2451.30 --> 2455.24]  And as we look at this together, I want us to consider a few questions this morning.
[2456.34 --> 2459.10]  First, where does goodness come from?
[2460.12 --> 2461.44]  What's the source of goodness?
[2461.44 --> 2464.84]  Secondly, what is good?
[2465.74 --> 2468.46]  And then thirdly, how can I become good?
[2469.12 --> 2470.32]  How can we become good?
[2471.44 --> 2473.10]  So where does goodness come from?
[2474.12 --> 2475.36]  That's our first question.
[2475.88 --> 2477.96]  And notice something this passage says,
[2478.28 --> 2481.12]  first, about who God is and who we are.
[2481.50 --> 2481.64]  Okay?
[2481.64 --> 2482.22]  This is important.
[2482.32 --> 2483.48]  Who God is and who we are.
[2483.48 --> 2489.46]  And so on the next slide there, in verse 6, Micah asks,
[2489.68 --> 2494.44]  what shall I do to stand before the exalted God?
[2494.94 --> 2497.68]  What shall I do to stand before this exalted God?
[2498.40 --> 2501.70]  And then in verse 8, he answers the question.
[2501.82 --> 2506.36]  He says, he has shown you, O mortal, what is good.
[2507.40 --> 2513.40]  So the first thing we see here is that there is this huge gap between God and us.
[2514.26 --> 2514.38]  Right?
[2514.50 --> 2515.68]  God is exalted.
[2515.92 --> 2517.54]  We are mortal.
[2518.22 --> 2519.90]  God is eternal.
[2520.60 --> 2521.72]  We are not.
[2521.82 --> 2523.84]  We are mortal.
[2524.86 --> 2526.64]  God is immense.
[2527.36 --> 2528.20]  We are small.
[2529.10 --> 2530.56]  God is pure and holy.
[2530.82 --> 2532.12]  We are flawed and sinful.
[2532.54 --> 2535.08]  So there is a chasm that lays between us.
[2536.04 --> 2540.68]  And the implication here is that God himself has to show us what goodness is.
[2540.68 --> 2545.38]  That God himself, he is the one who defines what goodness is.
[2546.20 --> 2549.02]  Psalm 106, verse 1, puts it this way.
[2550.50 --> 2553.78]  He says, give thanks to the Lord for he is what?
[2554.64 --> 2555.22]  Good.
[2556.14 --> 2557.76]  His love endures forever.
[2557.76 --> 2563.30]  And so we see here, even in the attributes of God, God's attributes are always tied to
[2563.30 --> 2566.04]  and activated by love.
[2566.64 --> 2568.12]  And by all the other attributes.
[2568.24 --> 2569.14]  They're all bound up together.
[2569.54 --> 2572.82]  But here we see that goodness is moving towards other people in love.
[2572.82 --> 2577.34]  So God has to show us what good is.
[2578.02 --> 2582.26]  And that means that the external standard of goodness is the very character of God.
[2582.52 --> 2583.72]  How do we know what goodness is?
[2584.02 --> 2584.50]  God.
[2585.42 --> 2586.70]  He is the standard.
[2588.08 --> 2589.76]  You know, and Jesus tells us the same thing.
[2589.86 --> 2595.58]  In Luke, chapter 18, when the rich young ruler shows up and he says to Jesus, he says this,
[2595.58 --> 2599.50]  good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[2601.02 --> 2602.18]  And what does Jesus say to him?
[2603.30 --> 2605.00]  Why do you call me good?
[2606.46 --> 2608.88]  No one is good except God alone.
[2609.74 --> 2614.06]  Then immediately in the very next verse, Jesus points to the Ten Commandments.
[2614.58 --> 2617.46]  To say, this is the goodness of God.
[2617.64 --> 2618.48]  The Ten Commandments.
[2618.48 --> 2627.18]  The goodness of God codified in the Ten Commandments, which tells us how to live in the world as God's people.
[2627.98 --> 2628.08]  Right?
[2628.18 --> 2630.30]  This is what it means to live the good life.
[2630.90 --> 2632.52]  It comes from God himself.
[2632.88 --> 2635.70]  And he teaches us and shows us in the Ten Commandments.
[2635.78 --> 2639.44]  And then we obey those commandments and live accordingly.
[2640.60 --> 2642.04]  And so friends, here's the point.
[2642.60 --> 2646.12]  The idea that everybody gets to define goodness for themselves.
[2646.12 --> 2646.60]  Right?
[2646.70 --> 2649.18]  That you get to live by what goodness is for you.
[2649.34 --> 2652.20]  And I get to pursue my own idea of goodness.
[2652.38 --> 2657.46]  And it doesn't matter what each of us decide as long as, you know, we don't hurt anybody.
[2657.98 --> 2658.80]  It's a myth.
[2659.42 --> 2660.48]  It's a complete myth.
[2660.78 --> 2662.54]  It doesn't work.
[2663.36 --> 2664.52]  It doesn't work.
[2664.56 --> 2666.00]  As we can see all around the world.
[2668.26 --> 2669.72]  Because why doesn't it work?
[2669.94 --> 2673.60]  It's because you are making yourself the reference point.
[2674.44 --> 2676.04]  And what's the problem with that?
[2676.12 --> 2680.86]  The problem with making yourself the reference point is that you are not God.
[2681.44 --> 2682.18]  That's the problem.
[2682.98 --> 2683.80]  You're not God.
[2684.26 --> 2686.82]  It's above your pay grace, you know, as we say.
[2688.40 --> 2694.44]  And the thing is, anything truly good in us as mere mortals, as God's creatures,
[2695.12 --> 2698.30]  simply mirrors God's own goodness.
[2698.30 --> 2703.44]  God is the fountain and spring of all goodness.
[2703.44 --> 2708.76]  And without God as the reference point that we are orienting our lives toward,
[2709.76 --> 2713.50]  we often struggle and fail to reflect God's goodness.
[2713.50 --> 2718.92]  And friends, this is the context into which Micah comes.
[2718.92 --> 2730.80]  And Micah is speaking, he's prophesying to the people of God in a time when both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah are prospering.
[2730.80 --> 2735.82]  Everything's going great during this time in the history of Israel.
[2735.82 --> 2743.08]  And as often has been the case in the story of God's people, when prosperity comes, what happens?
[2744.80 --> 2746.16]  Faithfulness departs.
[2746.60 --> 2749.60]  When prosperity comes, faithfulness departs.
[2749.60 --> 2756.94]  And they are already back to their old ways of worshiping the local gods of the land of Canaan.
[2758.04 --> 2764.72]  And now God, through Micah, his prophet, what he's doing is, if you read the whole book of Micah in a short,
[2764.82 --> 2770.24]  and I encourage you all to read it, he's bringing a lawsuit against his people.
[2771.38 --> 2777.30]  For idolatry, for injustice, and for not keeping the law.
[2777.30 --> 2783.88]  And he boils down the charges in Micah 3, verses 1 and 2.
[2787.40 --> 2788.54]  He says this,
[2788.64 --> 2794.14]  Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, should you not embrace justice?
[2794.84 --> 2798.62]  You who hate good and love evil.
[2799.76 --> 2800.88]  You see what's happening here?
[2801.58 --> 2806.14]  That when we cease to let God define goodness for us,
[2806.14 --> 2808.24]  the definitions become muddled.
[2808.84 --> 2812.84]  We say, well, what may be good for you is not necessarily good for me.
[2813.78 --> 2816.36]  What's good for me is not necessarily what's good for you.
[2817.56 --> 2819.72]  That may be right for you, but it's wrong for me.
[2819.92 --> 2822.24]  We say things like that, and God says,
[2822.48 --> 2824.96]  what you're doing is you're hating good and loving evil.
[2825.76 --> 2829.60]  It completely muddles the picture when we make ourselves the reference.
[2829.60 --> 2835.40]  And so that leads us to the second question this morning,
[2835.84 --> 2837.70]  which is, what is good?
[2838.64 --> 2841.18]  You know, we've seen that God is the source of goodness.
[2842.34 --> 2848.00]  He is the external reference point that we orient our lives to in this world.
[2848.36 --> 2852.22]  And then in verse 8, Micah says what goodness is.
[2852.22 --> 2856.88]  And friends, how God wants us to live in this world is not a mystery.
[2857.94 --> 2858.06]  Right?
[2858.10 --> 2861.04]  It's not a puzzle that we need to figure out.
[2861.50 --> 2864.12]  Because Micah says in verse 8,
[2864.58 --> 2866.80]  he has shown you.
[2867.30 --> 2870.02]  He has shown you, oh mortal, what is good.
[2870.46 --> 2872.18]  And what does the Lord require of you?
[2872.78 --> 2873.72]  To act justly.
[2874.04 --> 2875.08]  To love mercy.
[2875.48 --> 2877.70]  To walk humbly with your God.
[2877.70 --> 2878.34]  Right?
[2878.46 --> 2884.08]  And this is what God has always meant when he wants us to live a life of goodness in the world.
[2884.20 --> 2886.12]  Goodness that is reflecting his own goodness.
[2887.52 --> 2894.22]  And so let's just briefly look at each of these three characteristics of goodness that Micah shows us here.
[2895.04 --> 2898.36]  So first, goodness means to act justly.
[2898.82 --> 2899.82]  To act justly.
[2899.82 --> 2908.60]  This is a word that is almost always connected with four vulnerable groups in the Old Testament.
[2909.38 --> 2915.92]  People in the Old Testament who are widows, orphans, immigrants, and the poor.
[2916.84 --> 2927.68]  And so to reflect God's goodness in the world that God is saying means that you are committed to helping and caring for the most vulnerable people in your society.
[2927.68 --> 2934.70]  But to act, so that's kind of like to act justly is particularly oriented to those four groups of people.
[2934.80 --> 2936.60]  But there's a broader meaning as well.
[2936.70 --> 2941.94]  The general meaning, simply the behavior, the way of life that brings shalom.
[2942.42 --> 2945.94]  That brings goodness and wholeness and flourishing in God's world.
[2947.04 --> 2951.88]  So Zechariah chapter 8 verses 16 to 17 says this.
[2952.82 --> 2954.58]  These are the things you are to do.
[2955.58 --> 2957.40]  Speak the truth to each other.
[2958.54 --> 2961.28]  Render true and sound judgment in your courts.
[2962.02 --> 2965.38]  Do not plot evil against each other and do not love to swear falsely.
[2965.70 --> 2968.22]  I hate all of this, declares the Lord.
[2969.62 --> 2971.24]  So God wants us to act justly.
[2971.94 --> 2978.26]  That is to respect one another, to live with integrity, to treat people well and fairly.
[2978.82 --> 2981.32]  That's how we can live in the world, act justly.
[2981.76 --> 2985.94]  Second, God tells us that goodness is to love mercy.
[2985.94 --> 2994.56]  The word for mercy is the Hebrew word hesed, which is usually translated as steadfast love.
[2994.56 --> 3003.94]  And when it's associated with God, excuse me, it's associated with God, this hesed love means that he is the one that loves us.
[3004.38 --> 3004.78]  Right?
[3004.82 --> 3006.44]  Not because of anything in us.
[3006.52 --> 3008.76]  Not because of the good things that we have done.
[3008.76 --> 3011.74]  But he loves us because he loves us.
[3011.78 --> 3013.30]  He loves us for his own sake.
[3013.58 --> 3014.86]  He's committed to us.
[3014.90 --> 3018.04]  He's promised that he will love us.
[3018.10 --> 3021.50]  It's his covenant, faithful love.
[3021.50 --> 3028.06]  And so for you and I to love mercy, what does it mean?
[3028.18 --> 3031.62]  Well, it's to love the way that God has loved us.
[3033.96 --> 3034.70]  That's hard.
[3034.70 --> 3042.08]  But it means that we engage with others and we love others not just because we can get something out of it.
[3042.48 --> 3044.04]  That we can get something in return.
[3044.58 --> 3050.38]  It means that we are constantly and persistently loving people even though maybe they drain us.
[3050.98 --> 3053.82]  Even if they are the hardest people to love.
[3054.54 --> 3054.98]  Why?
[3055.62 --> 3057.30]  Because that is how God loves us.
[3057.30 --> 3060.48]  We are the hardest people to love.
[3061.06 --> 3064.94]  But God is persistent in his steadfast love for us.
[3065.30 --> 3066.78]  That's what it means to love mercy.
[3068.00 --> 3070.22]  And third, goodness is to walk humbly with your God.
[3070.98 --> 3076.20]  Now walking in the Bible is a metaphor for a few things, one of which is intimacy.
[3078.02 --> 3083.34]  Remember how Adam and Eve walked with God in the Garden of Eden.
[3084.32 --> 3085.92]  I think it's a beautiful picture.
[3085.92 --> 3090.78]  And just imagine it's this picture of intimacy in our relationship with God.
[3090.88 --> 3092.36]  Where we let him in.
[3092.94 --> 3094.84]  Where we are exposed to him.
[3095.34 --> 3098.34]  And he knows us deeply.
[3098.54 --> 3100.08]  And we seek to know God.
[3101.66 --> 3107.54]  And so the implication here is that there's a sense in which you bring everything in your life to God.
[3108.32 --> 3110.40]  That's what it means to walk humbly with God.
[3110.46 --> 3113.26]  Where you let everything in your life open to God.
[3113.56 --> 3114.74]  Not only parts of it.
[3114.74 --> 3116.54]  So imagine this with me.
[3117.48 --> 3118.90]  Girls, imagine this.
[3119.10 --> 3119.26]  Ready?
[3120.12 --> 3122.76]  Imagine your life as a house.
[3123.24 --> 3124.00]  Okay, you have a house.
[3124.54 --> 3127.62]  And there are all kinds of different rooms in the house.
[3128.24 --> 3131.10]  Each room in the house represents a different part of your life.
[3132.00 --> 3133.22]  Okay, so think about your house.
[3134.32 --> 3137.90]  Maybe, now we all don't have all of these rooms in our houses.
[3138.04 --> 3139.82]  But, you know, we're just trying to think of some different rooms.
[3139.82 --> 3142.08]  So maybe you have an office in your house.
[3142.72 --> 3145.76]  And the office, maybe for you, gems represents school.
[3146.38 --> 3147.56]  It represents learning.
[3148.14 --> 3148.28]  Right?
[3148.30 --> 3151.96]  Or maybe for the adults, it represents our work or our finances.
[3151.96 --> 3157.70]  Now, the living room in your house, maybe the living room represents your friends.
[3158.82 --> 3160.40]  Your social relationships.
[3161.44 --> 3162.22]  The kitchen.
[3163.36 --> 3164.24]  What you eat.
[3164.56 --> 3165.66]  How we treat our bodies.
[3165.78 --> 3167.14]  How do we take care of ourselves.
[3167.14 --> 3169.46]  Maybe your bedroom.
[3170.06 --> 3172.96]  If you have a bedroom, maybe that represents your heart.
[3173.14 --> 3174.10]  Your private thoughts.
[3174.30 --> 3175.24]  The things you care about.
[3175.56 --> 3176.62]  Things you're interested in.
[3177.66 --> 3181.54]  Maybe if you have other bedrooms in the house, they represent your parents.
[3181.78 --> 3182.82]  Or your siblings.
[3183.74 --> 3184.78]  Other family members.
[3185.78 --> 3189.22]  The front porch represents how you treat your neighbors.
[3189.22 --> 3191.52]  The family room.
[3191.62 --> 3192.70]  What you watch on TV.
[3193.66 --> 3193.80]  Right?
[3193.88 --> 3194.66]  Or video games.
[3194.76 --> 3195.64]  Or social media.
[3195.82 --> 3197.88]  Or whatever entertainment you're into.
[3198.92 --> 3207.12]  Now, if Jesus came to your house to visit, which rooms in your house does Jesus get to see?
[3208.76 --> 3212.10]  If Jesus knocked on the door and he came in and he says,
[3212.46 --> 3213.22]  Can I come in?
[3214.18 --> 3216.44]  Which rooms would you bring him to?
[3216.44 --> 3219.66]  Which rooms do you show him?
[3220.64 --> 3226.08]  And if you're like an average person like myself, you might start with the rooms that you're the most proud of.
[3226.44 --> 3227.94]  The ones that aren't too messy.
[3230.30 --> 3232.94]  Let's start with the rooms where I'm doing well.
[3233.44 --> 3234.26]  Things are tidy.
[3234.54 --> 3235.60]  They're not too gross.
[3236.66 --> 3238.16]  You know, they're in good repair.
[3238.54 --> 3239.38]  They're well decorated.
[3241.00 --> 3241.62]  Excuse me.
[3241.68 --> 3243.12]  The question Micah asks is,
[3243.12 --> 3247.32]  Does God get to go in every room of my house?
[3248.54 --> 3254.24]  Does he get to say how you live on the front porch with your neighbors?
[3255.04 --> 3256.92]  Does he get to walk around in your bedroom?
[3257.64 --> 3260.82]  And open up all the drawers and look inside and poke around?
[3263.16 --> 3265.58]  He has told you what he wants.
[3265.58 --> 3268.76]  So don't just show him the good rooms of your house and say,
[3269.04 --> 3270.88]  Look at this good part of my life.
[3271.80 --> 3276.70]  But to walk humbly with your God means you open up your whole life to him.
[3276.80 --> 3278.90]  Every single part of your life is exposed to God.
[3279.28 --> 3281.02]  We often don't live like that or believe it.
[3282.48 --> 3285.54]  You don't let God just into parts of your life.
[3286.12 --> 3288.92]  You bring him into every part of your life.
[3289.80 --> 3291.70]  That's what it means to walk humbly with your God.
[3291.70 --> 3294.06]  And what's really interesting about this passage,
[3294.18 --> 3296.48]  You know, such a famous passage, Micah 6, 8.
[3297.58 --> 3299.32]  You know, it's a summary of the law.
[3299.74 --> 3302.64]  It's a summary of the law that even as Jesus teaches it.
[3303.02 --> 3303.16]  Right?
[3303.24 --> 3304.20]  Because Jesus says this,
[3304.26 --> 3307.76]  That we are to love God with all of our hearts,
[3308.00 --> 3308.84]  With all of our souls,
[3308.92 --> 3310.48]  With all of our strength and our minds.
[3311.44 --> 3314.68]  For Micah, that is walking humbly with God.
[3314.84 --> 3315.44]  That's what it means.
[3315.52 --> 3316.40]  Walk humbly with God.
[3317.28 --> 3319.24]  And that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.
[3319.24 --> 3320.32]  That's how Jesus says it.
[3320.38 --> 3321.04]  And Micah says,
[3321.40 --> 3322.16]  Act justly.
[3322.88 --> 3323.56]  Love mercy.
[3324.30 --> 3325.10]  It's the whole law.
[3326.46 --> 3331.28]  And Micah says that this is the good that God calls us to orient our lives around.
[3331.40 --> 3332.14]  Loving God.
[3332.40 --> 3333.04]  Walking with him.
[3333.30 --> 3334.20]  In humility.
[3335.12 --> 3338.82]  Not telling him what we think goodness is.
[3339.06 --> 3340.90]  Not saying, like the devil,
[3341.34 --> 3342.84]  Did God really say?
[3343.96 --> 3345.00]  But in humility.
[3345.00 --> 3349.92]  God has told us what is good.
[3350.98 --> 3352.86]  And that really brings us to the final question.
[3353.54 --> 3354.84]  Well, how can I live this way?
[3355.02 --> 3356.32]  How can I walk in goodness?
[3356.74 --> 3361.26]  How can I orient my life on this map that God has given me?
[3362.86 --> 3365.06]  How can I become good?
[3366.50 --> 3368.66]  You know, because if we stop the sermon right here,
[3368.72 --> 3370.52]  And if we would just end on this note,
[3370.60 --> 3371.06]  It would say,
[3371.14 --> 3373.42]  Okay, now go do it.
[3373.72 --> 3373.90]  Right?
[3373.90 --> 3374.56]  That's what it would be.
[3374.64 --> 3375.06]  Go do it.
[3375.16 --> 3375.84]  Go and do likewise.
[3376.74 --> 3378.44]  Go and act justly.
[3378.54 --> 3379.24]  And love mercy.
[3379.36 --> 3380.52]  And walk humbly with God.
[3381.80 --> 3383.42]  But what if we left it at that?
[3384.68 --> 3385.76]  If we left it at that,
[3385.84 --> 3386.98]  We wouldn't last a day.
[3387.70 --> 3389.18]  We wouldn't make it out of here.
[3390.18 --> 3391.96]  I wouldn't make it out of here.
[3392.04 --> 3394.32]  The gap between the exalted God,
[3394.88 --> 3397.94]  That we are called to follow and orient our lives around,
[3397.94 --> 3402.96]  And my mortal, sinful, self-focused heart.
[3402.96 --> 3404.44]  The gap is too great.
[3405.10 --> 3406.32]  The gap is too great.
[3407.32 --> 3412.74]  We can't live up to what God requires of us in our own strength and in our own ability.
[3412.74 --> 3418.30]  So what we find here in this passage is not the how, but the who.
[3418.88 --> 3423.24]  Not how can I become good, but who is good.
[3424.36 --> 3431.48]  And what's so interesting about Micah is that the name Micah means who is like Yahweh.
[3432.34 --> 3432.96]  Is that interesting?
[3433.52 --> 3434.36]  Hey girls, did you hear that?
[3435.18 --> 3439.12]  The name Micah, you know, sometimes names have a meaning.
[3439.12 --> 3442.32]  The name Micah means who is Yahweh.
[3442.72 --> 3443.60]  You know who Yahweh is?
[3444.06 --> 3445.32]  The Lord, God.
[3445.86 --> 3446.52]  Okay, yeah.
[3446.72 --> 3448.00]  So who is God?
[3449.48 --> 3451.10]  Or who is like God?
[3451.94 --> 3453.58]  Who is like this God?
[3454.04 --> 3456.86]  In other words, it's not about what you bring.
[3457.06 --> 3458.26]  That's the question in verse 6.
[3458.30 --> 3461.02]  It's not about what we bring to this exalted God.
[3461.18 --> 3465.50]  It's about who this God is who will make you right with him.
[3465.50 --> 3469.68]  Because listen to this at the end of the book of Micah 7.
[3469.84 --> 3472.02]  And we had this as our assurance of pardon.
[3472.76 --> 3473.94]  But here's the passage again.
[3474.04 --> 3474.92]  I want to read it to us.
[3475.60 --> 3480.32]  It asks the question, basically, Micah, who is like you, O God?
[3481.18 --> 3486.20]  Who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?
[3487.00 --> 3491.70]  You do not stay angry forever, but delight to show mercy.
[3491.70 --> 3496.56]  You will again have compassion on us.
[3496.88 --> 3502.12]  You will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
[3502.64 --> 3504.08]  You will be faithful to Jacob.
[3504.48 --> 3511.56]  You will show love to Abraham as you pledged an oath to our ancestors in days long ago.
[3512.42 --> 3513.96]  Who is like this God?
[3514.70 --> 3517.34]  He is the one who does justice.
[3518.14 --> 3518.26]  Right?
[3518.36 --> 3520.80]  He is the one who shows mercy.
[3520.80 --> 3525.34]  He is the one who will show steadfast love to his people.
[3526.70 --> 3530.24]  And that's why God says to us, walk humbly with your God.
[3531.02 --> 3532.32]  Put that up there for me.
[3532.60 --> 3533.18]  Walk humbly.
[3533.56 --> 3534.56]  It's not just God.
[3535.52 --> 3537.14]  Your God.
[3537.44 --> 3538.72]  That is the key, friends.
[3539.38 --> 3539.98]  Your God.
[3540.60 --> 3548.00]  The only reason you and I can do the good that God requires is because God has already made us his own.
[3548.96 --> 3549.16]  Right?
[3549.16 --> 3559.06]  This is covenantal language where the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of Jesus Christ, invites us to be his daughters and sons.
[3560.28 --> 3562.50]  God says, you can call me your God.
[3563.18 --> 3563.62]  Right?
[3563.68 --> 3565.36]  Because I have saved you by grace.
[3565.50 --> 3567.16]  I have forgiven you.
[3567.16 --> 3569.24]  I have cast your sins into the depths of the sea.
[3569.64 --> 3577.24]  And if you understand that you are a sinner saved by grace, you can now stand before the exalted God by his grace.
[3577.24 --> 3589.08]  And the more we stand rooted in this grace and the mercy of God, stand rooted in his covenantal, never ending, never stopping, never giving up love for us.
[3589.08 --> 3595.30]  And the more we are sure of that love, the more we will become obedient and faithful to God.
[3595.30 --> 3607.36]  Because, friends, once you have been redeemed and you have been restored and forgiven and you have this renewed heart where you are receiving the whispers of the Holy Spirit and the thunders of God's grace in your life,
[3607.36 --> 3617.86]  your heart starts to tell you that whatever you are doing in this life, in this world, you can do it loving God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[3618.36 --> 3619.88]  Walking humbly with your God.
[3620.22 --> 3621.62]  Loving your neighbor as yourself.
[3621.76 --> 3622.40]  Doing justice.
[3623.20 --> 3623.68]  Acting.
[3624.00 --> 3625.48]  Doing justice and loving mercy.
[3625.48 --> 3626.48]  Doing justice.
[3626.48 --> 3627.48]  Doing justice.
[3627.48 --> 3629.26]  That's how you and I can become good.
[3630.22 --> 3630.46]  Right?
[3630.66 --> 3634.46]  We become good by looking to the God who is good toward us.
[3635.24 --> 3636.82]  God was so good to us.
[3638.38 --> 3642.26]  And I'll end with this quote by C.S. Lewis from his book, Mere Christianity.
[3643.02 --> 3643.92]  This is what he says.
[3645.96 --> 3653.62]  God will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling, radiant, immortal creature,
[3653.62 --> 3660.20]  pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine.
[3663.38 --> 3664.08]  Next.
[3667.00 --> 3673.58]  A bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly, though of course on a smaller scale.
[3674.50 --> 3677.78]  His own boundless power and delight in what?
[3678.68 --> 3679.26]  Goodness.
[3679.26 --> 3686.56]  The process will be long and in parts very painful, but that is what we are in for.
[3687.40 --> 3687.98]  Nothing less.
[3689.14 --> 3690.04]  God makes us good.
[3690.98 --> 3692.34]  He shows us what is good.
[3693.24 --> 3694.66]  He calls us to follow him.
[3695.46 --> 3696.26]  Let's pray together.
[3696.26 --> 3709.30]  Father, we thank you that you did not create us and leave us in a world casting us from your presence and not knowing what good is.
[3710.24 --> 3711.68]  But you have shown us.
[3712.82 --> 3714.78]  You have revealed to us what is good.
[3716.48 --> 3721.62]  And Lord, you have brought us into relationship with yourself and you have empowered us by your Holy Spirit.
[3721.62 --> 3725.38]  You have sent your Son, Jesus Christ, to die and rise again for us.
[3726.08 --> 3729.58]  Standing in this grace, Lord, you enable us to follow you.
[3730.32 --> 3737.34]  You enable us to orient our lives around what is good and call us to reflect it out into the world.
[3737.88 --> 3739.36]  Lord, would you help us by your Spirit?
[3739.72 --> 3740.74]  Would you sanctify us?
[3740.80 --> 3747.62]  Would you cause us to grow into this resplendent light of holiness that you are working in each one of us?
[3748.20 --> 3749.58]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3749.96 --> 3750.24]  Amen.
[3750.24 --> 3750.34]  Amen.
[3751.62 --> 3753.34]  Let's all stand.
[3754.12 --> 3755.76]  Let's sing our song of response.
[3755.76 --> 3756.14]  Amen.
[3772.14 --> 3773.38]  Amen.
[3773.38 --> 3774.04]  für're.
[3774.24 --> 3775.02]  We walk with us.
[3775.02 --> 3779.98]  Wide as we walk with the Lord in the line of His word.
[3779.98 --> 3785.38]  What a glory He sheds on our earth.
[3785.38 --> 3794.52]  That we do His good with, He abides with us still.
[3794.52 --> 3799.80]  And with all who will trust and obey
[3799.80 --> 3803.38]  Trust and obey
[3803.38 --> 3807.28]  For there's no other way
[3807.28 --> 3811.14]  To be happy in Jesus
[3811.14 --> 3816.18]  But to trust and obey
[3816.18 --> 3820.30]  But we never do
[3820.30 --> 3824.78]  The delights of His love
[3824.78 --> 3830.44]  And to all the altar we lay
[3830.44 --> 3835.54]  For the favor He shows
[3835.54 --> 3839.24]  And the joy He restores
[3839.24 --> 3844.38]  Over those who will trust and obey
[3844.38 --> 3848.06]  Trust and obey
[3848.06 --> 3852.08]  For there's no other way
[3852.08 --> 3856.12]  To be happy in Jesus
[3856.12 --> 3861.06]  But to trust and obey
[3861.06 --> 3866.44]  And in fellowship sweet
[3866.44 --> 3870.12]  You will sit at His feet
[3870.12 --> 3876.18]  All of our pride is tied in the way
[3876.18 --> 3881.18]  What He says we will do
[3881.18 --> 3884.12]  What He says we will go
[3884.12 --> 3887.14]  Never fear only
[3887.14 --> 3890.18]  Trust and obey
[3890.18 --> 3894.18]  Trust and obey
[3894.18 --> 3898.12]  For there's no other way
[3898.12 --> 3902.14]  To be happy in Jesus
[3902.14 --> 3907.20]  To trust and obey
[3907.20 --> 3908.20]  To trust and obey
[3908.20 --> 3916.92]  At this point we'll be taking our offering
[3916.92 --> 3918.90]  which is for the Gems Ministry
[3918.90 --> 3921.54]  and I think the Gems are going to be
[3921.54 --> 3921.84]  No?
[3922.38 --> 3922.62]  Okay.
[3923.18 --> 3926.04]  The Deacons will be collecting the offering.
[3926.04 --> 3950.08]  No?
[3950.08 --> 3952.08]  Amen.
[3980.08 --> 3982.08]  Amen.
[4010.08 --> 4012.08]  Amen.
[4040.08 --> 4042.08]  Amen.
[4070.08 --> 4072.08]  Amen.
[4100.08 --> 4102.08]  Amen.
[4102.08 --> 4104.08]  Amen.
[4104.08 --> 4106.08]  Amen.
[4106.08 --> 4108.08]  Amen.
[4108.08 --> 4110.08]  Amen.
[4110.08 --> 4112.08]  Amen.
[4112.08 --> 4114.08]  Please join me in prayer.
[4114.08 --> 4120.08]  Now we offer our prayers and thanksgiving and intercession.
[4120.08 --> 4127.08]  May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our rock and redeemer.
[4127.08 --> 4130.08]  Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[4130.08 --> 4136.08]  You created us in your image and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[4136.08 --> 4145.08]  We are thankful for the communities we live in, for the services which we sometimes take for granted, for clean water, for public servants,
[4145.08 --> 4153.08]  such as our police, our judges, doctors, nurses, firefighters, paramedics, and those involved in education.
[4153.08 --> 4162.08]  We pray for us for a blessing in all those frontline workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[4162.08 --> 4167.08]  We pray for our farmers as it is soon time to plant.
[4167.08 --> 4174.08]  We ask for a good growing season, hopefully with weather getting warmer to get the crop in.
[4174.08 --> 4184.08]  We pray for our nation, for our prime minister, our premier, and the mayors of the communities we represent in Delta, Richmond, and Surrey.
[4184.08 --> 4188.08]  We pray for them, for our nations of the world for the world, give them wisdom in their leadership.
[4188.08 --> 4189.08]  We pray for our broken world.
[4189.08 --> 4199.08]  For Christians around the world, we want to especially remember Christians in the country of Iran, and many persons are coming to faith in Iran.
[4199.08 --> 4200.08]  Protect your church there.
[4200.08 --> 4207.08]  We pray for a change of heart in the leadership, to give more freedoms to Christian believers.
[4207.08 --> 4212.08]  We hear about the ongoing refugee crisis around the world.
[4212.08 --> 4217.08]  Very much in our heart and mind is the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
[4217.08 --> 4222.08]  We see the images in the media and our hearts go out to all those uprooted,
[4222.08 --> 4226.08]  millions who have fled their homes and have become refugees.
[4226.08 --> 4231.08]  We pray for those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[4231.08 --> 4236.08]  Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating this violence.
[4236.08 --> 4243.08]  Bless world leaders as they grapple with these insurmountable, seemingly insurmountable conflicts.
[4243.08 --> 4250.08]  We pray for our world as we see a rise in authoritarian power in many countries.
[4250.08 --> 4252.08]  We want to pray for our church.
[4252.08 --> 4256.08]  Bless our ministry leaders, for Pastor Jason,
[4256.08 --> 4262.08]  and we also want to remember him as he takes a study leave the first two weeks of May
[4262.08 --> 4265.08]  as he travels to the Middle East.
[4265.08 --> 4269.08]  And Lord, we pray that may be a time of refreshment and a time of learning and a blessing
[4269.08 --> 4271.08]  and safety in traveling.
[4271.08 --> 4275.08]  We pray for our Pastor, Associate Pastor Nancy,
[4275.08 --> 4280.08]  and our Children's Ministry Coordinator Hannah, and our deacons and elders.
[4280.08 --> 4285.08]  We are thankful for all the children and teachers involved in kids' life.
[4285.08 --> 4288.08]  We are especially thankful this morning for our GEMS ministry,
[4288.08 --> 4292.08]  for all the girls and counselors involved.
[4292.08 --> 4298.08]  And we are thankful that our ministries have been able to resume since restrictions are being lifted.
[4298.08 --> 4302.08]  We continue to bless the Chinese ministry in our church.
[4302.08 --> 4307.08]  May we continue to grow together so that we may be one body getting to know each other better.
[4307.08 --> 4314.08]  We are thankful with Fahid and Benez in the safe arrival of their daughter, Avinah, this past Friday.
[4314.08 --> 4322.08]  Bless them as they raise our new daughter and also as they are still adjusting to life in Canada.
[4322.08 --> 4326.08]  We want to remember others in our congregation.
[4326.08 --> 4329.08]  We pray for those who have recently lost loved ones.
[4329.08 --> 4332.08]  We pray for Jean, for Jerry, for Noreen.
[4332.08 --> 4338.08]  We pray for those who are living in care, are facing long-term illnesses.
[4338.08 --> 4357.08]  And we pray for Joyce, for Carl, for Grace, for Mark, for Jerry and Anne, for Shirley, for Diane, for Jeanette, for John, for Henry and Ellie and Jeanette Ram.
[4357.08 --> 4362.08]  Lord, this is a long list of people, but we know that you care for each one.
[4362.08 --> 4365.08]  And we pray for their families and their caregivers.
[4365.08 --> 4373.08]  Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts like mental illness or depression,
[4373.08 --> 4378.08]  addictions and broken relationships in families and marriages.
[4378.08 --> 4387.08]  Gracious God, accept all these prayers in Jesus' name, and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer,
[4387.08 --> 4390.08]  and to live faithfully in response to your call.
[4390.08 --> 4393.08]  Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[4393.08 --> 4405.08]  Please rise.
[4405.08 --> 4407.08]  We'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4407.08 --> 4411.08]  God always gets the last word in our worship service.
[4411.08 --> 4418.08]  And I want to share first a verse from Micah chapter 4, verse 5.
[4418.08 --> 4419.08]  It says,
[4419.08 --> 4432.08]  All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, forever and ever.
[4432.08 --> 4438.08]  Friends, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing upon you.
[4438.08 --> 4445.08]  May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus,
[4445.08 --> 4451.08]  that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[4451.08 --> 4461.08]  And may he work in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
[4461.08 --> 4466.08]  So remain standing and we'll sing our final song as we prepare to go.
[4466.08 --> 4493.08]  We receive your blessing, we receive your grace, as we walk in light shining from your face.
[4493.08 --> 4498.08]  May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4498.08 --> 4508.08]  We receive your blessing as we lead this place.
[4508.08 --> 4514.08]  Praise God, O God, O God, from whom all blessings flow.

[4532.08 --> 4533.08]  Praise God, O God, from whom all blessings flow.
[4533.08 --> 4537.08]  We receive your blessing, we receive your grace.
[4537.08 --> 4543.08]  As we walk in light shining from your face.
[4543.08 --> 4548.08]  May the peace that you give change the way that we live.
[4548.08 --> 4553.08]  We receive your blessing, we receive your blessing as we live.
[4553.08 --> 4555.08]  We receive your blessing as we live.
[4555.08 --> 4557.08]  We receive your blessing as we leave this place.
[4557.08 --> 4558.08]  We receive your blessing as we live.
[4558.08 --> 4564.08]  Praise God, O God, from whom all blessings flow.
[4564.08 --> 4570.08]  Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[4570.08 --> 4576.08]  Praise Him, above you heavenly host.
[4576.08 --> 4581.08]  Praise Father, Son, and praise the Holy Ghost.
[4581.08 --> 4591.08]  We receive your blessing as we leave this place.
[4591.08 --> 4611.08]  Praise God, O God, from whom all blessings flow.
