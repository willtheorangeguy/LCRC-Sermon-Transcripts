[305.00 → 306.00] Good morning.
[306.00 → 312.00] Welcome to this worship service here together and also on the livestream.
[312.00 → 316.00] May the Lord bless us as we come together and worship His holy name.
[316.00 → 318.00] I have three announcements.
[318.00 → 321.00] The first one is Pastor Jason, welcome back.
[321.00 → 326.00] I'm sure that Pastor Jason will have many stories to tell the next weeks and months ahead.
[326.00 → 333.00] The other one is next week Sunday, a reminder that there is no worship service here, but
[333.00 → 337.00] it will be on May Day, call it May Day in the park.
[337.00 → 344.00] And then in your bulletin, and I was just reminded again that you have to be ready for making soup
[344.00 → 354.00] and sandwiches because, or luncheon because the, the Ajee, the Imran family is coming here on the June the 19th.
[354.00 → 355.00] Is that correct?
[355.00 → 356.00] Okay.
[356.00 → 358.00] That's what it says.
[358.00 → 363.00] And now we will have the Lord's greeting.
[363.00 → 370.00] We are still in the important 40 days between the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord.
[370.00 → 372.00] And He's coming back again.
[372.00 → 377.00] And then after that, ten more days for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[377.00 → 384.00] The disciples, the apostles and us have to go into the world to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to all the nations.
[384.00 → 396.00] And so I like to, it's again in the Psalms and in the prophets, two parts, two verses of scripture that speak about the coming of the Lord and the blessing to the nations.
[396.00 → 399.00] And the first one comes from Psalm 86.
[399.00 → 407.00] There it says, all the nations you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord.
[407.00 → 413.00] They will bring glory to your name, for you are great and do marvellous deeds.
[413.00 → 416.00] You alone are God.
[416.00 → 422.00] And then in the last prophets in the Old Testament, before our Lord comes, we hear these words.
[422.00 → 427.00] My name will be great among the nations.
[427.00 → 435.00] From the rising to the setting of the sun, in every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name.
[436.00 → 442.00] Because my name will be great among the nations, says the Lord Almighty.
[442.00 → 448.00] May I ask you who all of you are able to stand, to receive God's greeting.
[448.00 → 454.00] Congregation of our Lord Jesus Christ, grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[454.00 → 457.00] And from the seven spirits who are before his throne.
[457.00 → 463.00] And from Jesus Christ, the faithful saviour and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[463.00 → 465.00] And let us all say, Amen.
[465.00 → 468.00] And let us now greet one another.
[495.00 → 496.00] Amen.
[496.00 → 514.00] All hail the power of Jesus, Name that angels cross-strained call,
[514.00 → 515.50] Record the royal DI Ав so that you shall remain free from tenha cells.
[515.50 → 520.00] 1914 is the pattern of the issue of the nations you have experienced.
[520.00 → 531.94] Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[531.94 → 543.94] Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[543.94 → 553.70] Let every tongue and every tribe of his terrestrial love.
[553.70 → 564.70] To him all majesty has bright and crown him Lord of all.
[564.70 → 576.70] To him all majesty has bright and crown him Lord of all.
[576.70 → 587.70] Oh that with all the sacred from thee at his feet may fall.
[587.70 → 599.70] We'll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all.
[599.70 → 613.70] We'll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all.
[613.70 → 631.70] From the depths of the sea.
[631.70 → 638.70] From the depths of the sea.
[638.70 → 642.70] From the heights of the heaven.
[642.70 → 646.70] Let your name be praised.
[646.70 → 649.70] From the hearts of the weak.
[649.70 → 651.70] From the hearts of the weak.
[651.70 → 653.70] From the shouts of the strong.
[653.70 → 655.70] From the shouts of the strong.
[655.70 → 656.70] From the lips of the people.
[656.70 → 657.70] From the lips of the people.
[657.70 → 658.70] From the lips of the people.
[658.70 → 660.70] From the lips of the people.
[660.70 → 665.70] This song we raise whole.
[665.70 → 670.70] Throughout the endless ages.
[670.70 → 673.70] You will be crowned with praises.
[673.70 → 674.70] Lord most high.
[674.70 → 675.70] Lord most high.
[675.70 → 680.70] Exalted in every nation.
[680.70 → 685.70] Sour of all creation.
[685.70 → 688.70] Lord most high.
[688.70 → 689.70] Be magnified.
[689.70 → 690.70] Be magnified.
[690.70 → 691.70] Be magnified.
[691.70 → 695.70] Be magnified.
[695.70 → 701.70] On the ends of the earth.
[701.70 → 706.70] The depths of the sea.
[706.70 → 708.70] From the depths of the sea.
[708.70 → 734.12] The hearts of the weak, the shouts of the strong, from the lips of old me, this song we raise on.
[734.12 → 746.38] Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[746.38 → 757.88] Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[757.88 → 759.88] Be magnified.
[761.88 → 763.88] Be magnified.
[763.88 → 769.88] Be magnified.
[769.88 → 770.88] Amen.
[799.88 → 800.88] Amen.
[829.88 → 830.88] Amen.
[859.88 → 860.88] Amen.
[889.88 → 890.88] Amen.
[919.88 → 920.88] Amen.
[949.88 → 950.88] Amen.
[979.88 → 980.88] Amen.
[1009.88 → 1014.88] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1014.88 → 1019.88] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1019.88 → 1024.88] Christ is mine forevermore.
[1024.88 → 1037.88] Amen.
[1037.88 → 1045.52] The children ages 3 to 7, grade 7, are welcome now to Kids Club and continue to worship in
[1045.52 → 1046.52] the children's worship.
[1046.52 → 1051.52] May the Lord bless you.
[1051.52 → 1058.52] Amen.
[1058.52 → 1064.52] Amen.
[1064.52 → 1069.52] Amen.
[1069.52 → 1080.52] Today this nation is honouring Queen Victoria.
[1080.52 → 1085.52] I found out that this only happens in Canada and in parts of Scotland.
[1085.52 → 1090.52] I thought it would be in England and every other country that's connected to England, only
[1090.52 → 1093.52] in Canada and in parts of Scotland.
[1093.52 → 1097.52] Queen Victoria, of course, was an amazing queen, incredible leader.
[1097.52 → 1098.52] She reigned for more than 60 years.
[1098.52 → 1104.52] The thing is with worldly leaders, no matter how good they are, we have a tendency and a
[1104.52 → 1112.52] temptation to worship worldly leaders, just like us, you and me.
[1112.52 → 1113.52] And scripture is warning us against that.
[1113.52 → 1119.52] And I would like to read to you a few verses from Psalm 146.
[1119.52 → 1126.52] And that says, do not put your trust in princes, which might be kings and queens, politicians,
[1126.52 → 1129.52] you can fill in the blank.
[1129.52 → 1132.52] In mortal men who cannot save.
[1132.52 → 1139.52] And when their spirit departs, they return to the ground.
[1139.52 → 1143.52] On that very day, their plans come to nothing.
[1143.52 → 1149.52] And Queen Victoria, by the way, died in 1901.
[1149.52 → 1158.52] Blessed are you whose help is in the name of the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord,
[1158.52 → 1170.52] and is or is his God, the maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them, and the Lord,
[1170.52 → 1173.52] who remains faithful forever.
[1173.52 → 1178.52] Now, of course, in the name Victoria, you find the name Victor or victory.
[1178.52 → 1185.52] And that means conquering someone else, conquer about life, life over death.
[1185.52 → 1191.52] And so, I'd like to go back again, and I quoted last week from 1 Corinthians 15.
[1191.52 → 1198.52] It's a very important chapter, where Paul ends with these words about victory in Jesus Christ.
[1198.52 → 1204.52] He says at the end, death has been swallowed up in victory.
[1204.52 → 1207.52] Where, O death, is your sting?
[1207.52 → 1210.52] Or where, O death, is your victory, rather?
[1210.52 → 1213.52] Where, O death, is your sting?
[1213.52 → 1218.52] The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[1218.52 → 1220.52] But thanks be to God.
[1220.52 → 1225.52] He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1225.52 → 1228.52] And after this comes the application.
[1228.52 → 1233.52] The Apostle Paul then says, therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm.
[1233.52 → 1235.52] Let nothing move you.
[1235.52 → 1244.52] Always give yourselves to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.
[1244.52 → 1245.52] Let's pray.
[1245.52 → 1257.52] Heavenly Father, we come to you with maybe broken hearts, but also with joyful hearts, because again of the message that you give us from your word.
[1257.52 → 1261.52] Thank you, Lord, for the victory that is in Jesus Christ.
[1261.52 → 1266.52] Even though kingdoms may arise, they also will fall.
[1266.52 → 1271.52] And everything that will happen, and is happening even today in the world, your rule supreme.
[1271.52 → 1277.52] Above all, through Jesus Christ, who shed out his blood for our sins.
[1277.52 → 1281.52] And so that one day, and today, we will be forever with him.
[1281.52 → 1284.52] And so we praise you, and we glorify your holy name.
[1284.52 → 1288.52] Be with us, Lord, as we continue this morning to worship you.
[1288.52 → 1291.52] Be with Pastor Jason as he brings you your message.
[1291.52 → 1292.52] Be with all of us.
[1292.52 → 1300.52] And Lord God, we give you the praise and the glory through Jesus Christ, our Lord, the one who gained the victory.
[1300.52 → 1302.52] In his name we pray.
[1302.52 → 1303.52] Amen.
[1303.52 → 1307.52] And then we'll have our hymn of response.
[1307.52 → 1309.52] Thank you, thanks.
[1309.52 → 1324.88] What love could remember no wrongs we have done
[1324.88 → 1330.10] Omnis and tall knowing he counts what their son
[1330.10 → 1336.02] Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
[1336.02 → 1342.26] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1342.26 → 1349.54] He's alive his mercy is more
[1349.54 → 1357.22] Stronger than darkness through every morn
[1357.22 → 1362.42] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1362.42 → 1370.48] What patience would wait as we constantly roam
[1370.48 → 1375.62] What father, so tender is calling us home
[1375.62 → 1380.66] He welcomes the weakness to rile us the poor
[1380.66 → 1386.90] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1386.90 → 1394.90] Praise the Lord his mercy is more
[1394.90 → 1402.96] Stronger than darkness through every morn
[1402.96 → 1408.10] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1408.10 → 1416.16] What riches of kindness he lavished on us
[1416.16 → 1421.30] His blood was the payment his life was the cost
[1421.30 → 1426.16] We stood beneath the dead we could never afford
[1426.16 → 1428.40] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1428.40 → 1434.40] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1434.40 → 1440.64] Praise the Lord his mercy is more
[1440.64 → 1444.46] Praise the Lord his mercy is more
[1444.46 → 1449.52] Stronger than darkness through every morn
[1449.52 → 1454.52] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1454.52 → 1464.58] Praise the Lord his mercy is more
[1464.58 → 1469.58] Stronger than darkness through every morn
[1469.58 → 1476.58] Our sins they are many his mercy is more
[1476.58 → 1481.56] Our sins they are many his mercy it would not be
[1481.56 → 1497.60] We are many his mercy is more
[1497.60 → 1501.66] Our scripture reading this morning is from Luke 8 verses 4 to 15
[1501.66 → 1509.40] While a large crowd was gathered and people were coming to Jesus from town after town,
[1509.66 → 1510.86] he told this parable.
[1511.86 → 1514.08] A farmer went out to sow his seed.
[1515.08 → 1518.74] As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path.
[1519.60 → 1522.26] It was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.
[1522.80 → 1524.90] Some fell on rocky ground.
[1525.62 → 1530.16] And when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.
[1530.16 → 1536.16] Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.
[1537.12 → 1539.54] Still other seed fell on good soil.
[1540.32 → 1544.10] It came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown.
[1545.22 → 1547.24] When he said this, he called out,
[1547.88 → 1550.64] Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.
[1551.82 → 1554.96] His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
[1554.96 → 1556.30] He said,
[1556.82 → 1560.56] The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you.
[1561.00 → 1563.66] But to others I speak in parables so that,
[1564.36 → 1566.60] Though seeing, they may not see.
[1567.20 → 1569.68] Though hearing, they may not understand.
[1571.02 → 1573.08] This is the meaning of the parable.
[1573.88 → 1575.70] The seed is the word of God.
[1576.62 → 1578.98] Those along the path are the ones who hear.
[1578.98 → 1583.14] And then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts,
[1583.38 → 1586.22] So that they may not believe and be saved.
[1587.30 → 1591.96] Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it.
[1592.54 → 1593.96] But they have no root.
[1594.92 → 1598.64] They believe for a while, but in times of testing they fall away.
[1598.64 → 1603.56] The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear.
[1604.34 → 1605.86] But as they go on their way,
[1606.12 → 1609.00] They are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures,
[1609.38 → 1610.98] And they do not mature.
[1612.24 → 1616.84] But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart,
[1617.38 → 1619.76] Who hear the word, retain it,
[1620.10 → 1622.58] And by persevering, produce a crop.
[1623.38 → 1624.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[1624.98 → 1626.82] Thanks be to God.
[1628.64 → 1637.56] Good morning.
[1638.28 → 1640.50] It's great to be with you again.
[1640.88 → 1644.76] As some of you will know, I've been away for three Sundays
[1644.76 → 1650.48] on a trip with other CRC pastors throughout Canada
[1650.48 → 1653.14] to Egypt and Jordan and Israel.
[1653.88 → 1656.92] And so here is a group photo.
[1657.06 → 1658.14] There are about 30 of us.
[1658.14 → 1663.22] And this is on the Mount of Olives overlooking the city of Jerusalem.
[1663.78 → 1665.68] And you see that gold is the Dome of the Rock.
[1666.02 → 1668.06] And that's kind of the temple complex right there.
[1668.06 → 1674.96] So they told us, when you get back to your churches, do not show a slideshow,
[1675.50 → 1680.26] because what it looks like to all of you would be,
[1680.64 → 1681.60] And here's a rock.
[1682.26 → 1683.72] And then here's another rock.
[1684.84 → 1687.94] When you're there, there's special, there's meaning.
[1688.06 → 1688.76] We talk about it.
[1688.80 → 1691.58] When I come back and show you, it really just looks like a bunch of rocks.
[1691.58 → 1695.22] So I will, and it was very formative.
[1695.22 → 1699.84] And a couple of things I took away, and I can't spend a lot of time-sharing all of them right now.
[1701.00 → 1703.86] One thing was just to get a sense of the geography.
[1704.34 → 1709.10] You know, it was kind of following the redemptive history and story of God's people from Egypt
[1709.10 → 1713.62] and into the Sinai, then up the Jordan, and then into the Promised Land,
[1713.68 → 1717.38] and just kind of walking that journey on buses and planes, and some walking.
[1719.50 → 1721.94] Well, it just really helps with understanding.
[1721.94 → 1729.24] Another thing I experienced, which was special, especially after COVID, for two years,
[1729.36 → 1733.70] of all of us not really experiencing Christian community like we are meant to,
[1734.40 → 1739.68] being together with this group of people, we really started as a group but became a community.
[1740.30 → 1743.78] And that was really special, and it reminded me the importance of the church
[1743.78 → 1746.28] and what it means for us to be a community together.
[1747.48 → 1751.14] So with that said, there's so much I could say, but I just wanted to quickly share.
[1751.14 → 1753.44] I know many of you will be wondering, how was it?
[1753.62 → 1754.80] So it was a great trip.
[1754.92 → 1755.58] I learned a lot.
[1755.90 → 1760.38] Maybe over the coming weeks, months, I'll be able to share some things here and there.
[1760.98 → 1761.14] Okay.
[1762.52 → 1767.64] So as we kind of turn our attention to God's word, let me pray for us as we begin.
[1767.86 → 1768.24] Let's pray.
[1771.26 → 1779.30] Living God, help us this morning to so hear your holy word that we may truly understand.
[1779.30 → 1786.72] And in understanding we may believe, and believing we may follow in all faithfulness and obedience,
[1787.74 → 1790.84] seeking your honour and glory in all that we do.
[1791.32 → 1794.16] We ask through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1794.82 → 1795.20] Amen.
[1798.40 → 1800.52] Do you have ears to hear?
[1801.76 → 1802.06] Right?
[1802.12 → 1804.86] That's what Jesus asked, didn't he, in the passage that we read.
[1804.86 → 1808.64] Do you have ears to hear God's word?
[1810.48 → 1815.22] Joshua Bell is one of the great masters of the violin.
[1816.06 → 1819.66] And back in 2007, he did a sort of social experiment.
[1820.10 → 1821.46] Maybe you have heard about this.
[1821.96 → 1823.86] Sometimes you can see it on the internet.
[1823.86 → 1834.16] So what happens is Joshua Bell went in and stood into kind of the entrance foyer of the metro system in Washington, D.C.
[1834.34 → 1841.38] on a busy Friday morning when all the people are commuting during rush hour, going to work.
[1842.64 → 1844.52] And he dressed like a normal guy.
[1844.74 → 1850.94] He wore a t-shirt and jeans and a Washington Nationals cap on his head.
[1850.94 → 1862.24] But two nights before, he was playing at the Boston Symphony Hall, where people paid hundreds of dollars for a ticket.
[1863.06 → 1868.00] And now he was going to play in the metro station as people were just passing by.
[1869.04 → 1874.86] And the experiment was to see how many people would stop and listen.
[1874.86 → 1883.00] And so they counted 1,097 people who passed by in 45 minutes.
[1883.94 → 1888.28] And they asked the maestro of the National Symphony there in Washington, D.C.,
[1888.28 → 1895.66] they asked him to guess, how many people do you think would stop and listen to this music being played?
[1895.66 → 1905.86] And he guessed, you know, out of 1,000 people, probably about 150 would stop and listen and appreciate the music.
[1906.70 → 1909.92] Now guess how many people stopped to listen?
[1912.90 → 1913.46] Seven.
[1914.12 → 1914.52] Seven.
[1915.50 → 1916.36] Maybe, yeah, seven.
[1916.48 → 1917.66] So maybe some of you know this one.
[1919.02 → 1919.18] Yeah.
[1919.18 → 1922.90] Now one of the so here's the situation.
[1923.04 → 1929.54] It's one of the finest musicians in the world playing some of the most elegant music ever written
[1929.54 → 1934.74] on one of the most valuable violins that was ever made.
[1934.82 → 1935.96] It's worth over $3 million.
[1937.56 → 1941.02] He is filling concerts all over the world.
[1941.18 → 1943.50] People are paying to hear him play the violin.
[1943.50 → 1951.32] But 1,000 people walk by just completely oblivious to the music that is being offered to them absolutely free.
[1953.16 → 1955.52] People didn't even slow their gait.
[1955.60 → 1959.14] Of course they're going to work, but you just watch this video and people just rushing by.
[1959.52 → 1960.36] No pause.
[1960.66 → 1962.68] No turning of the ear to listen.
[1963.72 → 1965.56] They didn't have ears to hear.
[1965.56 → 1975.88] Jesus came announcing the most beautiful sound, the most beautiful words that anybody had ever heard,
[1975.96 → 1981.54] that God was intervening into this broken world, and he's coming to make it new again.
[1982.30 → 1987.38] And yet many people did not have the ears to hear.
[1987.38 → 1993.98] So what's going on here is that Jesus has been travelling with his disciples.
[1994.78 → 1998.96] And Jesus has been going around preaching from town to town, preaching the word of God,
[1999.34 → 2001.20] preaching that the kingdom of God has come.
[2002.04 → 2007.00] And now what he's doing here in this parable is he's helping his disciples
[2007.00 → 2012.60] to understand the different kinds of responses to his teaching.
[2013.94 → 2015.24] And so Jesus tells a parable.
[2015.24 → 2017.48] It's his favourite way to teach.
[2018.22 → 2021.60] And this is also one of the most well-known parables.
[2022.16 → 2024.38] Maybe many of us here are familiar with it.
[2025.08 → 2028.02] It's often referred to as the parable of the sower.
[2028.80 → 2032.18] But a better name would be the parable of the soils.
[2034.02 → 2036.80] Jesus compares the word of God to seed.
[2037.80 → 2040.26] He sees himself as the farmer.
[2040.90 → 2043.68] And he's sowing that seed through his preaching.
[2043.68 → 2049.54] And now whether the seed grows into a healthy plant that produces fruit
[2049.54 → 2054.98] depends entirely upon the type of soil upon which the seed falls.
[2055.66 → 2058.56] So he tells this parable about four types of soil.
[2058.94 → 2063.34] And they correspond to four different conditions of the heart.
[2063.34 → 2067.96] And the question for us this morning as we listen to this parable is to ask,
[2068.72 → 2069.94] which one am I?
[2071.86 → 2073.64] And I know that's a challenge to us.
[2073.68 → 2074.56] You know why it's a challenge?
[2075.42 → 2077.76] Because we've heard this parable before, haven't we?
[2078.82 → 2080.54] We're so familiar with this.
[2080.54 → 2081.60] If you've been a Christian.
[2082.98 → 2089.48] The challenge for us is to listen to what Jesus is saying and to ask,
[2089.72 → 2093.78] what is the soil condition of my heart?
[2094.40 → 2097.16] Do I have ears to hear God's word?
[2098.02 → 2100.56] So let's give ourselves to those questions.
[2100.68 → 2104.50] Let's hear Jesus speaking to us in this parable this morning.
[2104.50 → 2109.24] And what I'd like to do is just kind of look at each of these four conditions of the heart
[2109.24 → 2111.12] that Jesus talks about here this morning.
[2111.86 → 2115.04] And the first one is a hardened heart.
[2115.74 → 2116.64] A hardened heart.
[2117.42 → 2120.68] So Jesus says that some of the seed fell along the path.
[2121.70 → 2124.14] And so what happened is these paths were hard
[2124.14 → 2126.92] because they were usually in the middle of the field
[2126.92 → 2130.28] and the farmer would be walking up and down the path.
[2130.28 → 2134.96] And so the ground has become compacted and is turned rock hard
[2134.96 → 2138.72] by the steady foot traffic of the people walking along the path.
[2139.52 → 2141.96] And here, as he scatters the seed,
[2142.08 → 2145.58] the seed doesn't even make a dent on the earth.
[2146.18 → 2150.64] As soon as it hits that path, it is crushed underfoot and is eaten by birds.
[2151.60 → 2155.32] The seed doesn't even make it into the soil at all.
[2156.02 → 2157.94] You see it just kind of bouncing right off.
[2157.94 → 2162.52] So this is talking about people who listen to the word that Jesus brings,
[2162.94 → 2164.72] but it doesn't sink in.
[2165.60 → 2167.52] And Jesus says this is the work of the devil.
[2167.64 → 2172.88] He comes, and he seeks to discredit and undermine God's word anywhere he can.
[2174.62 → 2176.30] And today we see this kind of response
[2176.30 → 2179.24] when the word of God is immediately discarded
[2179.24 → 2183.36] before it is given any sort of consideration at all.
[2183.98 → 2186.58] I heard another pastor talk about a girl.
[2186.58 → 2192.20] He knew who loved reading the Narnia stories when she was growing up.
[2193.64 → 2198.76] But as she got older, she discovered that Aslan the lion was patterned after Jesus.
[2200.08 → 2205.74] And then in learning that, it led her to not want to read those stories anymore
[2205.74 → 2209.76] because she didn't want anything to do with Jesus.
[2211.70 → 2216.82] And friends, this is what happens when the word of God falls on this hard path.
[2217.44 → 2219.20] It's filtered out immediately.
[2219.38 → 2222.96] It has no effect whatsoever on a person's life.
[2222.96 → 2227.60] And if you look at verse 10,
[2228.86 → 2230.50] listen to what Jesus says here.
[2231.70 → 2232.26] Jesus said,
[2232.42 → 2235.84] The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you,
[2235.98 → 2238.28] but to others I speak in parables.
[2239.00 → 2240.16] So that, quote,
[2240.80 → 2242.42] Though seeing they may not see,
[2242.64 → 2244.84] though hearing they may not understand.
[2244.84 → 2248.70] And here Jesus is quoting from Isaiah chapter 6, verse 9,
[2249.40 → 2251.52] where God spoke to the prophet Isaiah
[2251.52 → 2256.88] when he called Isaiah to preach to God's people.
[2257.00 → 2260.70] So this is kind of Isaiah's ordination commission here.
[2261.60 → 2264.34] And God tells Isaiah that his preaching and his prophecies
[2264.34 → 2266.58] will actually have the effect,
[2266.90 → 2268.84] not of calling people to know God,
[2268.90 → 2269.68] but the opposite,
[2270.30 → 2273.26] it will have the effect of hardening people in their unbelief.
[2273.26 → 2274.22] Right?
[2274.30 → 2275.10] So it's like, you know,
[2275.40 → 2276.42] God is saying to Isaiah,
[2276.56 → 2277.84] Isaiah, go out there,
[2278.30 → 2279.50] preach the good news,
[2279.96 → 2282.42] because nobody is going to listen.
[2283.08 → 2283.86] And actually,
[2284.06 → 2285.94] it's only going to make it worse.
[2288.36 → 2291.20] One of my favourite comics is,
[2291.54 → 2292.16] in the newspaper,
[2292.28 → 2293.34] has always been The Far Side.
[2293.80 → 2295.26] Does anybody like Far Side by Gary Larson?
[2296.80 → 2297.68] Here's one of them.
[2298.56 → 2299.26] We'll put it up.
[2299.72 → 2300.84] So I don't know if you can see it,
[2300.86 → 2301.60] but I'll read it for you.
[2302.10 → 2303.22] What we say to dogs,
[2303.36 → 2303.90] I'll have to turn.
[2304.72 → 2305.40] Okay, Ginger,
[2305.96 → 2307.02] I've had it.
[2307.60 → 2309.52] You stay out of the garbage.
[2309.62 → 2310.32] Understand, Ginger?
[2310.42 → 2312.28] Stay out of the garbage or else.
[2313.70 → 2314.98] Okay, what does the dog hear?
[2316.10 → 2317.60] Blah, blah, Ginger.
[2318.60 → 2320.36] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Ginger.
[2321.12 → 2321.72] Blah, blah, blah.
[2323.80 → 2324.16] Okay.
[2324.16 → 2324.24] Okay.
[2324.80 → 2325.54] So now,
[2326.10 → 2327.70] there's a woman speaking to her cat.
[2328.86 → 2330.10] Here's what the cat says.
[2330.10 → 2331.96] Well, fluffy,
[2332.12 → 2334.24] you've clawed the furniture for the last time.
[2334.30 → 2337.02] I will not tolerate that behaviour any longer.
[2338.08 → 2339.42] And what does the cat hear?
[2343.10 → 2344.36] Absolutely nothing.
[2345.36 → 2345.76] Right.
[2345.76 → 2349.62] It's so like cats.
[2349.80 → 2351.52] Just totally tuning her out.
[2352.92 → 2356.14] And that's the effect Jesus says his parables have on people.
[2356.14 → 2359.18] For those who have ears to hear,
[2359.60 → 2361.48] the parables help them in their belief.
[2361.92 → 2365.46] They see windows into the meaning of the kingdom of God.
[2365.46 → 2370.34] But for people who already have an estranged relationship from God,
[2370.98 → 2372.96] and who already refuse to hear,
[2373.30 → 2376.30] hearing God's word only makes it worse.
[2376.68 → 2379.52] They just hear blah, blah, blah.
[2380.42 → 2381.82] Or they hear nothing at all.
[2383.00 → 2385.60] And it just confirms them in their hardness of heart.
[2385.86 → 2390.92] Because they have already mastered the art of filtering out God's voice.
[2390.92 → 2395.82] This is what God's word did when Isaiah preached it.
[2396.78 → 2400.56] It is what God's word did when Jesus preached it.
[2402.20 → 2405.56] And this is what God's word does today when it is preached.
[2407.34 → 2408.72] Okay, so that's the first kind of heart.
[2408.80 → 2409.80] It's a hardened heart.
[2409.98 → 2412.02] Where the word of God just gets filtered out.
[2412.08 → 2413.08] It just bounces right off.
[2413.08 → 2417.60] Now the second kind of heart Jesus talks about is a shallow heart.
[2418.72 → 2422.38] So Jesus says some of the seed landed on rocky soil.
[2423.20 → 2424.42] And when it says rocky,
[2424.70 → 2427.20] it doesn't mean that it's a field with lots of rocks in it.
[2427.24 → 2430.58] Of course that's kind of something a farmer would not like.
[2431.32 → 2435.56] But actually what's going on here is that the soil looks amazing.
[2436.44 → 2438.96] It looks rich and great for planting.
[2439.48 → 2441.76] But what the problem is that it is shallow.
[2441.76 → 2445.66] Because what you have is a very thin layer of good topsoil
[2445.66 → 2451.22] on top of a thick layer of bedrock, of chalk or limestone.
[2452.50 → 2454.30] And so what happens is the soil is not deep.
[2454.36 → 2457.54] It's not deep enough to retain the moisture
[2457.54 → 2461.46] that would be sufficient to produce fruit-bearing plants.
[2462.76 → 2464.44] And so a seed would fall on this soil
[2464.44 → 2467.34] and immediately it would spring up.
[2467.34 → 2470.78] But the heat of the sun would kill it
[2470.78 → 2472.00] because it has no roots.
[2472.36 → 2473.44] And it withers away.
[2475.28 → 2477.56] And Jesus says this kind of, this second soil,
[2477.72 → 2480.20] it refers to those who hear the word of God
[2480.20 → 2483.50] and they respond positively.
[2484.48 → 2484.64] Right?
[2484.88 → 2486.40] The seeds shoot right up.
[2486.48 → 2489.84] And Jesus even says they receive the word with joy.
[2489.84 → 2495.18] Some of the commentators say that this likely refers to the crowds
[2495.18 → 2497.18] who are following Jesus.
[2497.78 → 2498.30] Right?
[2498.36 → 2499.58] They're responding, aren't they?
[2500.44 → 2501.76] They're following Jesus.
[2502.48 → 2503.54] He's feeding them.
[2503.64 → 2504.56] He's healing them.
[2504.82 → 2505.70] He's doing miracles.
[2505.90 → 2507.22] They're amazed by his teachings.
[2507.48 → 2508.78] They're singing Hosanna.
[2509.74 → 2513.06] And there's great enthusiasm about Jesus.
[2513.06 → 2516.58] But a man comes along, and he says,
[2516.72 → 2518.32] I will follow you wherever you go.
[2519.52 → 2520.48] And Jesus says,
[2521.00 → 2522.12] Are you sure?
[2523.30 → 2525.98] Do you know that foxes have holes to sleep in
[2525.98 → 2527.94] and birds of the air have nests to sleep in?
[2528.28 → 2530.80] But I don't even have a bed to call my own.
[2532.20 → 2534.22] Do you have any idea what it means to follow me?
[2535.10 → 2536.78] Another man came up and said,
[2537.84 → 2539.70] Lord, what must I do?
[2539.76 → 2541.12] And he says, go and sell everything.
[2541.12 → 2544.46] And he went away sad.
[2546.44 → 2549.66] To follow Jesus means to deny yourself and take up your cross.
[2550.70 → 2551.54] And so in this parable,
[2551.66 → 2554.96] Jesus says this person encounters a time of testing.
[2556.32 → 2557.78] And by this, he means a season
[2557.78 → 2560.86] when it's no longer easy and exciting to be a Christian.
[2561.78 → 2561.96] Right?
[2562.12 → 2563.30] No more free meals.
[2563.48 → 2564.24] No more healing.
[2564.90 → 2565.82] No more entertainment.
[2567.34 → 2569.90] Instead, there is a significant price to be paid
[2569.90 → 2573.46] if one is going to continue to be faithful to God's ways.
[2574.54 → 2575.34] You know, it may be today,
[2575.38 → 2578.00] as we think about our lives and people we know,
[2578.58 → 2579.70] someone becomes a Christian,
[2579.94 → 2581.98] but, well, their spouse isn't interested.
[2583.06 → 2586.12] So they're not willing to bear the difficulty of that.
[2587.46 → 2590.46] Or maybe you're studying the Word of God
[2590.46 → 2593.86] and it says something that kind of rubs you the wrong way
[2593.86 → 2596.54] or rubs against the grain of our culture.
[2598.60 → 2599.54] Or you may,
[2600.16 → 2602.76] following Jesus may involve taking a stand on something
[2602.76 → 2605.80] when doing so will bring difficulty into your life.
[2607.30 → 2607.42] Right?
[2607.46 → 2609.48] And so the person follows Jesus for a time,
[2609.60 → 2611.28] but then they will slowly wither
[2611.28 → 2613.08] when the cost of discipleship
[2613.08 → 2615.20] is something that they are no longer willing to pay.
[2615.20 → 2619.06] Okay, so that's the shallow heart.
[2619.98 → 2621.72] Now let's look at the third type of soil,
[2622.26 → 2624.82] and this is what we can call the divided heart.
[2626.62 → 2628.68] So here we're told that some soil,
[2629.28 → 2631.06] some soil falls on the hardened path
[2631.06 → 2632.38] and it just kind of pings right off.
[2632.50 → 2634.22] Some falls on the shallow soil,
[2634.34 → 2635.66] it grows up quickly but withers.
[2636.64 → 2639.60] Here, the seed falls among the thorns.
[2639.60 → 2643.02] And what happens is the seed takes root
[2643.02 → 2644.36] and it grows.
[2645.48 → 2649.10] But the thorns also grow up beside it.
[2649.38 → 2650.98] And they're choking the plant
[2650.98 → 2652.58] and they're preventing growth.
[2654.10 → 2656.58] And this one's more challenging
[2656.58 → 2659.18] because the plant may even take root
[2659.18 → 2660.40] and it may grow
[2660.40 → 2664.48] and it may develop for an extended period of time.
[2665.16 → 2665.38] Right?
[2665.42 → 2666.62] It doesn't just wither away.
[2666.62 → 2668.98] It's not going to turn brown
[2668.98 → 2670.96] like the plant on the rocky soil.
[2672.48 → 2673.22] So in other words,
[2673.28 → 2676.10] there's no obvious stop to following Jesus.
[2676.26 → 2677.50] There's no obvious termination
[2677.50 → 2679.02] to this person's discipleship.
[2680.42 → 2682.96] But Jesus says there is a profound problem here.
[2684.12 → 2685.94] Though it stays alive,
[2686.52 → 2687.62] the plant never matures.
[2688.86 → 2692.88] By this, Jesus means it fails to yield any fruit.
[2692.88 → 2695.88] And as for fruit,
[2695.98 → 2697.18] I think it's best here to think
[2697.18 → 2699.16] in terms of Christian virtues.
[2699.66 → 2699.80] Right?
[2699.86 → 2701.70] Like faith and hope and love.
[2702.78 → 2705.16] These things never really take hold
[2705.16 → 2707.90] and grow and manifest in a person's life.
[2709.34 → 2709.82] Right?
[2709.90 → 2711.16] So the plant is there
[2711.16 → 2713.52] but the thorns are taking up all the space.
[2713.74 → 2715.34] They're absorbing all the nutrients
[2715.34 → 2718.10] and they're choking out the life of the plant.
[2718.10 → 2721.92] So there's a Super Bowl commercial
[2721.92 → 2723.82] from a couple of years ago
[2723.82 → 2724.76] where there's a couple
[2724.76 → 2726.40] who walk into a pet store.
[2727.94 → 2729.92] And one of the couple,
[2730.16 → 2730.96] the husband or the wife,
[2731.06 → 2731.58] whichever one,
[2731.76 → 2734.16] one of them wants a Doberman.
[2734.68 → 2734.78] Right?
[2734.84 → 2735.74] Doberman is a big,
[2735.78 → 2736.78] kind of ferocious dog.
[2737.44 → 2739.50] The other wants a Chihuahua.
[2740.00 → 2740.10] Right?
[2740.12 → 2741.72] Those are the little kind of dogs
[2741.72 → 2742.48] you can carry around.
[2743.58 → 2744.44] And so they're in there,
[2744.52 → 2745.54] they're having this conversation,
[2745.66 → 2746.78] this argument in the pet store,
[2746.78 → 2749.60] and the employee of the pet store says,
[2750.02 → 2750.44] well look,
[2750.54 → 2751.62] you can always compromise
[2751.62 → 2753.60] and breed them together.
[2755.42 → 2757.72] And so we're introduced in the commercial to,
[2758.64 → 2761.26] sorry this was bothering me.
[2761.38 → 2761.54] Okay.
[2761.84 → 2762.94] We're introduced in the commercial
[2762.94 → 2765.14] to the Doberman.
[2766.14 → 2767.40] I don't know if you can see it there.
[2768.46 → 2770.90] So this is a dog that has a Chihuahua body,
[2771.06 → 2771.62] a little body,
[2772.24 → 2773.62] and a Doberman head.
[2773.62 → 2776.44] But it turns out that this thing
[2776.44 → 2777.60] is an absolute terror.
[2778.30 → 2779.00] And in the commercial,
[2779.22 → 2780.70] people are running and screaming
[2780.70 → 2781.38] through the streets
[2781.38 → 2782.70] that this thing is tearing along,
[2783.24 → 2784.72] and it starts chasing people,
[2785.04 → 2787.26] and it's just not a good situation.
[2788.16 → 2789.30] And so this commercial is actually
[2789.30 → 2790.44] for the carmaker, Audi.
[2791.60 → 2792.84] And the point of the commercial
[2792.84 → 2794.48] is where they introduce the new car,
[2794.58 → 2795.22] and they say,
[2795.88 → 2797.76] compromise scares us too.
[2797.76 → 2800.32] There are just some things
[2800.32 → 2802.04] you don't compromise on.
[2803.00 → 2803.68] Buy Audi.
[2804.22 → 2804.30] Right.
[2805.86 → 2807.60] And friends, similarly,
[2808.24 → 2809.92] this third soil is someone
[2809.92 → 2811.82] who compromises in their hearts.
[2812.78 → 2813.42] Right.
[2813.48 → 2814.72] It's someone who hears
[2814.72 → 2815.68] the word of the gospel.
[2816.16 → 2817.74] They even make a commitment
[2817.74 → 2818.90] to Christ,
[2819.04 → 2820.66] and some growth is seen.
[2820.66 → 2822.96] But Jesus says
[2822.96 → 2824.30] that worries,
[2825.68 → 2826.02] riches,
[2826.98 → 2828.38] and pleasures of life
[2828.38 → 2830.18] crowd out faith,
[2830.28 → 2831.48] and they slowly choke
[2831.48 → 2832.74] the possibility
[2832.74 → 2834.06] of fruit
[2834.06 → 2835.48] growing to maturity
[2835.48 → 2836.36] in the person's life.
[2837.44 → 2837.94] And friends,
[2838.04 → 2838.50] here's the thing.
[2838.58 → 2839.14] Listen to this.
[2840.08 → 2841.34] This could be
[2841.34 → 2843.26] anyone
[2843.26 → 2844.44] of us in this room.
[2845.84 → 2847.76] A regular churchgoer
[2847.76 → 2849.40] who appears
[2849.40 → 2850.24] to be a disciple.
[2851.78 → 2851.98] You know,
[2852.02 → 2852.60] but we have
[2852.60 → 2854.12] these deep-seated worries.
[2854.76 → 2854.90] You know,
[2854.94 → 2855.72] we have questions like,
[2855.88 → 2856.88] will I have enough money?
[2857.54 → 2858.56] Will I ever have
[2858.56 → 2859.40] the kind of house
[2859.40 → 2860.14] I desire,
[2860.32 → 2861.50] or job I desire,
[2861.62 → 2862.80] or retirement I desire,
[2862.96 → 2864.82] or relationship I desire?
[2865.70 → 2866.42] Will my kids
[2866.42 → 2867.20] or my grandchildren
[2867.20 → 2868.20] be okay?
[2868.98 → 2869.68] And these are not
[2869.68 → 2870.36] bad questions
[2870.36 → 2871.26] in and of themselves,
[2871.80 → 2873.02] but in the parable,
[2873.12 → 2874.42] it's this sort of worries,
[2874.62 → 2875.40] these questions
[2875.40 → 2876.96] that begin to occupy
[2876.96 → 2878.58] too much acreage
[2878.58 → 2879.44] in our hearts,
[2879.66 → 2881.14] and they consume
[2881.14 → 2882.68] all of our attention
[2882.68 → 2883.72] and our energy,
[2884.32 → 2885.88] instead of that energy
[2885.88 → 2886.32] and attention
[2886.32 → 2887.20] being devoted
[2887.20 → 2887.98] to growing
[2887.98 → 2889.36] in the spiritual life
[2889.36 → 2890.20] and following Christ
[2890.20 → 2891.08] and producing fruit.
[2892.76 → 2893.74] Or maybe,
[2893.90 → 2894.48] it could be someone
[2894.48 → 2895.64] who professes faith,
[2895.74 → 2897.02] but their real allegiance
[2897.02 → 2897.94] is actually
[2897.94 → 2899.18] to pleasure and money.
[2901.12 → 2901.38] Right?
[2901.42 → 2902.32] There are just certain things
[2902.32 → 2903.24] in the Christian life
[2903.24 → 2904.42] that they're not willing
[2904.42 → 2905.22] to give up,
[2905.32 → 2906.28] and what they're really
[2906.28 → 2906.96] living for
[2906.96 → 2908.18] is not God,
[2908.32 → 2910.48] but these other things.
[2911.74 → 2912.04] And so,
[2912.22 → 2913.12] whether it's being
[2913.12 → 2914.28] overrun by worries
[2914.28 → 2915.42] or being consumed
[2915.42 → 2916.14] in our hearts
[2916.14 → 2916.88] by this quest
[2916.88 → 2918.00] for pleasure or riches,
[2918.72 → 2919.70] in both cases,
[2919.80 → 2920.68] the common root
[2920.68 → 2921.48] of the problem
[2921.48 → 2922.42] is a drive
[2922.42 → 2923.68] for security
[2923.68 → 2925.02] and comfort
[2925.02 → 2926.04] apart
[2926.04 → 2927.26] from faithfulness
[2927.26 → 2927.70] to God.
[2929.74 → 2930.78] So that is
[2930.78 → 2932.72] the divided heart,
[2932.82 → 2934.14] the compromised heart.
[2934.14 → 2936.38] And lastly,
[2936.50 → 2937.14] the fourth type
[2937.14 → 2937.60] of soil
[2937.60 → 2938.86] is the fertile heart.
[2939.96 → 2940.70] Jesus says,
[2941.22 → 2942.16] still other seed
[2942.16 → 2943.58] fell on good soil.
[2944.14 → 2944.90] It came up
[2944.90 → 2945.94] and yielded a crop
[2945.94 → 2947.62] a hundred times more
[2947.62 → 2948.96] than what was sown.
[2951.10 → 2951.84] And, you know,
[2951.88 → 2952.68] I really love this
[2952.68 → 2954.46] because just think about
[2954.46 → 2955.76] the picture
[2955.76 → 2956.46] that Jesus
[2956.46 → 2957.32] is showing us here.
[2957.56 → 2957.96] Think about
[2957.96 → 2958.74] a little seed,
[2959.38 → 2960.54] a tiny little seed.
[2960.54 → 2962.66] it's a small piece
[2962.66 → 2963.72] of God's word.
[2964.92 → 2965.44] Sometimes
[2965.44 → 2967.58] it seems so insignificant.
[2967.82 → 2968.42] Maybe it's something
[2968.42 → 2969.20] someone said,
[2970.30 → 2970.92] a sermon
[2970.92 → 2971.88] or a song
[2971.88 → 2972.46] that quotes
[2972.46 → 2973.08] from scripture.
[2973.34 → 2974.38] Just a little piece
[2974.38 → 2975.06] of God's word.
[2975.82 → 2976.78] But like a seed,
[2976.86 → 2978.28] it goes into the ground
[2978.28 → 2979.38] and it disappears
[2979.38 → 2980.42] into our hearts.
[2981.32 → 2981.44] Right?
[2981.48 → 2982.28] Every time the word
[2982.28 → 2983.56] is spoken
[2983.56 → 2984.24] and preached,
[2984.42 → 2985.08] the seeds are being
[2985.08 → 2986.48] scattered into hearts.
[2987.20 → 2987.72] And the seed,
[2987.82 → 2988.66] it enters deep
[2988.66 → 2989.44] into our hearts
[2989.44 → 2990.30] and it disappears.
[2990.42 → 2991.28] But then quietly,
[2992.34 → 2993.12] sometimes without us
[2993.12 → 2993.68] even knowing
[2993.68 → 2994.34] and slowly
[2994.34 → 2995.72] but invisibly,
[2996.40 → 2997.12] through the power
[2997.12 → 2997.94] of God's spirit,
[2998.26 → 2998.88] the word begins
[2998.88 → 2999.52] to take root.
[3000.02 → 3001.26] And it begins to grow.
[3002.20 → 3002.78] And it begins
[3002.78 → 3003.78] to produce fruit.
[3005.14 → 3005.92] And Jesus says
[3005.92 → 3007.36] a hundred times
[3007.36 → 3008.10] what was sown.
[3009.32 → 3010.22] And if you're a farmer,
[3010.36 → 3010.80] you know
[3010.80 → 3012.70] that that's impossible.
[3013.66 → 3014.46] A hundred times.
[3015.00 → 3015.14] You know,
[3015.18 → 3016.02] a ten would be
[3016.02 → 3017.66] an abundant harvest.
[3017.66 → 3019.78] Ten,
[3019.86 → 3020.08] you know,
[3020.14 → 3020.72] for those people
[3020.72 → 3021.44] listening to that,
[3021.52 → 3021.80] they would say
[3021.80 → 3022.60] a hundred times
[3022.60 → 3023.90] that's unimaginable.
[3024.74 → 3025.74] But Jesus says
[3025.74 → 3026.56] it is possible.
[3027.48 → 3028.68] And it's not possible
[3028.68 → 3029.74] because of the sower,
[3030.02 → 3030.40] the farmer.
[3030.64 → 3031.34] It's not possible
[3031.34 → 3033.06] just because of the seed
[3033.06 → 3034.26] by itself.
[3034.50 → 3035.32] It's not possible
[3035.32 → 3036.12] because of the soil.
[3036.44 → 3037.02] It is possible
[3037.02 → 3038.04] because God
[3038.04 → 3039.22] gives the growth.
[3039.22 → 3043.86] So now let's step back
[3043.86 → 3046.14] and let me just,
[3046.32 → 3047.18] I want to encourage us
[3047.18 → 3048.02] to think about this.
[3049.38 → 3050.34] That one of the challenges
[3050.34 → 3051.10] of this parable,
[3051.28 → 3052.28] as I said in the beginning,
[3052.40 → 3054.12] is that it is so familiar,
[3054.32 → 3055.36] it is so known to us.
[3055.42 → 3056.92] And it is easy for us
[3056.92 → 3058.14] as Christians to say,
[3058.80 → 3059.10] oh yeah,
[3059.18 → 3060.22] the parable of the sower.
[3060.30 → 3061.28] I've heard that one before.
[3062.02 → 3062.78] I'm the good soil,
[3063.12 → 3063.92] of course.
[3064.76 → 3064.88] Right?
[3064.96 → 3065.14] We don't,
[3065.80 → 3066.38] obviously,
[3066.54 → 3067.08] I'm the good soil.
[3067.08 → 3068.40] And then we just kind of
[3068.40 → 3068.90] move on.
[3069.66 → 3069.80] Okay.
[3071.52 → 3072.34] But there's something
[3072.34 → 3073.68] sobering about this passage.
[3073.90 → 3074.60] Sometimes we think
[3074.60 → 3075.62] every time Jesus
[3075.62 → 3076.38] opens his mouth,
[3076.52 → 3078.08] it's like super encouraging.
[3079.02 → 3080.38] But there's not a lot
[3080.38 → 3080.86] of encouragement
[3080.86 → 3081.94] in this parable.
[3082.94 → 3083.98] Notice that three
[3083.98 → 3085.06] out of the four
[3085.06 → 3086.00] types of soil
[3086.00 → 3087.04] don't bear fruit.
[3088.72 → 3090.02] The farmer wants fruit,
[3090.10 → 3090.32] right?
[3091.44 → 3093.52] If the plant doesn't grow
[3093.52 → 3094.66] and produce fruit,
[3095.24 → 3096.34] well, that's a failed crop.
[3097.08 → 3100.36] There's a 75%
[3100.36 → 3101.04] failure rate
[3101.04 → 3101.72] going on here.
[3102.76 → 3103.90] And it's also sobering
[3103.90 → 3105.52] because three
[3105.52 → 3106.28] out of the four
[3106.28 → 3107.90] grow to some extent
[3107.90 → 3110.14] so we can be deceived.
[3112.24 → 3113.34] And that means,
[3113.52 → 3113.68] friends,
[3113.74 → 3114.84] that we need to
[3114.84 → 3116.08] take this to heart.
[3116.96 → 3117.28] Right?
[3117.30 → 3118.08] We need to listen.
[3118.64 → 3119.38] We need to ask,
[3119.52 → 3120.82] what is the soil condition
[3120.82 → 3121.64] of my heart?
[3121.64 → 3124.30] And if we're honest,
[3124.76 → 3125.36] in the hearts
[3125.36 → 3126.48] of each one of us
[3126.48 → 3127.16] in this room,
[3127.26 → 3128.04] myself included,
[3128.32 → 3129.24] we have parts
[3129.24 → 3129.80] of our hearts
[3129.80 → 3130.52] that are like
[3130.52 → 3131.90] each type of soil
[3131.90 → 3132.94] in this parable.
[3134.02 → 3134.20] Right?
[3134.26 → 3135.58] Our hearts can be hardened
[3135.58 → 3136.86] at times to God's voice,
[3136.92 → 3137.28] can't they?
[3138.32 → 3140.68] We have shallow soil
[3140.68 → 3141.56] in our hearts
[3141.56 → 3142.72] and we wilt
[3142.72 → 3144.30] when trials come.
[3144.30 → 3147.22] The worries
[3147.22 → 3147.84] and the pleasures
[3147.84 → 3148.58] of this world
[3148.58 → 3150.04] can also have a hold
[3150.04 → 3150.98] on our hearts.
[3151.98 → 3152.54] And so the question
[3152.54 → 3153.44] of this parable is,
[3153.78 → 3154.82] how is it even possible
[3154.82 → 3155.74] that any of us
[3155.74 → 3156.84] can have ears to hear?
[3158.58 → 3159.78] How can we hear
[3159.78 → 3160.58] the beautiful music
[3161.14 → 3162.40] of God's voice
[3162.40 → 3163.64] and have a heart
[3163.64 → 3164.38] that can receive
[3164.38 → 3164.90] his word
[3164.90 → 3165.44] and grow
[3165.44 → 3166.48] and bear fruit?
[3166.80 → 3167.76] How can that happen?
[3167.76 → 3170.04] And the answer
[3170.04 → 3171.04] is that for anyone,
[3171.24 → 3172.30] whether inside the church
[3172.30 → 3173.58] or outside the church,
[3173.86 → 3175.14] to hear and receive
[3175.14 → 3176.08] the word of God
[3176.08 → 3177.78] is like seeing
[3177.78 → 3178.42] a turtle
[3178.42 → 3179.94] on a fence post.
[3181.04 → 3181.72] Have you ever
[3181.72 → 3182.28] heard that before?
[3182.96 → 3183.72] A turtle?
[3184.14 → 3185.48] It's a favourite thing
[3185.48 → 3186.32] of, I didn't make this up,
[3186.40 → 3186.66] it's like,
[3186.86 → 3187.58] preachers love this.
[3188.00 → 3188.54] A turtle
[3188.54 → 3189.74] on a fence post.
[3190.44 → 3191.22] If you see a turtle
[3191.22 → 3192.02] on a fence post,
[3192.34 → 3193.26] what do you know?
[3193.26 → 3197.88] How did he get up there?
[3198.36 → 3199.04] Did he get up there
[3199.04 → 3199.56] by himself?
[3200.68 → 3201.28] No.
[3203.42 → 3204.62] Paul tells us
[3204.62 → 3205.62] in Galatians 5,
[3206.98 → 3207.50] the fruit
[3207.50 → 3209.06] of the spirit
[3209.06 → 3211.28] is love,
[3211.92 → 3212.22] joy,
[3212.94 → 3213.40] peace,
[3213.72 → 3214.16] patience,
[3214.52 → 3214.80] kindness,
[3215.00 → 3215.26] goodness,
[3215.42 → 3215.80] faithfulness,
[3215.90 → 3216.30] gentleness,
[3216.80 → 3217.62] and self-control.
[3218.40 → 3219.36] And if this fruit
[3219.36 → 3219.86] is growing
[3219.86 → 3220.90] in your life,
[3221.78 → 3222.80] it's like a turtle
[3222.80 → 3223.24] on a fence post.
[3223.26 → 3225.70] You didn't climb
[3225.70 → 3226.82] up there yourself.
[3227.86 → 3228.94] You didn't
[3228.94 → 3230.10] produce
[3230.10 → 3231.02] that fruit
[3231.02 → 3232.02] because you
[3232.02 → 3233.80] are such good soil.
[3236.84 → 3238.58] God has to do
[3238.58 → 3238.98] something
[3238.98 → 3239.92] in order for that
[3239.92 → 3240.32] to happen.
[3240.68 → 3241.68] God has to do it.
[3241.90 → 3243.12] It's his grace.
[3244.18 → 3244.92] And that's just
[3244.92 → 3245.92] what Jesus says here.
[3246.50 → 3247.16] In verse 10,
[3247.28 → 3247.50] again,
[3247.60 → 3248.40] Jesus says to his
[3248.40 → 3249.12] disciples,
[3249.60 → 3250.10] the knowledge
[3250.10 → 3250.66] of the kingdom
[3250.66 → 3251.12] of God
[3251.12 → 3251.82] has been what?
[3251.82 → 3254.42] given to you.
[3256.32 → 3257.20] Open ears
[3257.20 → 3257.86] that truly
[3257.86 → 3259.28] hear and believe
[3259.28 → 3259.88] God's word
[3259.88 → 3260.72] and receive it
[3260.72 → 3261.40] in our hearts.
[3261.54 → 3262.40] It is a gift
[3262.40 → 3262.88] of God.
[3263.30 → 3263.84] It's a gift
[3263.84 → 3264.66] of God's grace.
[3265.56 → 3266.24] The reality
[3266.24 → 3266.92] is that none
[3266.92 → 3267.82] of us can change
[3267.82 → 3268.88] the conditions
[3268.88 → 3269.80] of soil in our hearts.
[3270.14 → 3270.64] None of us
[3270.64 → 3271.54] can improve
[3271.54 → 3272.02] the soil
[3272.02 → 3272.84] in our hearts
[3272.84 → 3274.08] that we can,
[3274.30 → 3275.10] by our own efforts,
[3275.26 → 3276.14] produce more fruit
[3276.14 → 3276.66] for God.
[3276.66 → 3279.38] but we can be
[3279.38 → 3279.94] encouraged
[3279.94 → 3281.24] because we
[3281.24 → 3282.12] have a good
[3282.12 → 3282.78] gardener.
[3284.32 → 3285.50] Can I get an amen?
[3286.76 → 3288.16] We have a good
[3288.16 → 3288.64] gardener.
[3289.60 → 3290.92] Jesus alone
[3290.92 → 3291.70] is able
[3291.70 → 3292.72] to till up
[3292.72 → 3293.40] the soil
[3293.40 → 3294.34] in our hearts
[3294.34 → 3295.72] and he is able
[3295.72 → 3297.20] to bring fruitfulness
[3297.20 → 3299.10] from his word
[3299.10 → 3300.68] in our hearts.
[3301.44 → 3302.56] And that means
[3302.56 → 3303.64] that what we can do,
[3303.70 → 3304.84] we can go to the gardener,
[3305.00 → 3305.64] we can go to him
[3305.64 → 3306.06] in prayer,
[3306.98 → 3307.64] and we can say,
[3307.76 → 3308.00] Jesus,
[3308.14 → 3309.70] my heart is hard.
[3310.24 → 3311.06] Would you please
[3311.06 → 3311.76] soften it?
[3313.08 → 3313.52] We can say,
[3313.62 → 3313.92] Jesus,
[3314.26 → 3315.48] sometimes I just
[3315.48 → 3316.22] tune you out.
[3317.24 → 3318.14] Would you break
[3318.14 → 3319.00] through and would you
[3319.00 → 3319.84] speak to me?
[3321.64 → 3322.12] Jesus,
[3323.00 → 3324.90] the soil of my heart
[3324.90 → 3325.42] is shallow.
[3325.58 → 3326.24] Sometimes I feel
[3326.24 → 3326.80] like I might
[3326.80 → 3327.70] wilt away.
[3328.40 → 3329.26] Would you grow
[3329.26 → 3330.08] the roots
[3330.08 → 3330.70] of your word
[3330.70 → 3331.68] deep in my heart?
[3333.86 → 3334.34] Jesus,
[3334.48 → 3335.26] sometimes I see
[3335.26 → 3335.98] that worries
[3335.98 → 3337.06] and comforts
[3337.06 → 3338.32] are competing
[3338.32 → 3339.42] for space
[3339.42 → 3340.20] in my heart.
[3341.10 → 3341.76] My heart
[3341.76 → 3342.48] is thorny.
[3342.88 → 3343.22] Would you
[3343.22 → 3344.34] weed out
[3344.34 → 3344.96] those thorns?
[3345.62 → 3345.92] Would you
[3345.92 → 3346.62] make space
[3346.62 → 3347.34] for you
[3347.34 → 3348.88] to rule
[3348.88 → 3350.36] in my heart?
[3351.32 → 3351.78] And when we
[3351.78 → 3352.42] pray these things,
[3352.48 → 3352.86] what will the
[3352.86 → 3353.78] gardener say to us?
[3354.56 → 3355.28] He will say,
[3355.34 → 3355.94] of course,
[3356.82 → 3357.34] of course,
[3357.40 → 3357.90] I will do
[3357.90 → 3358.56] that for you.
[3359.38 → 3359.72] Friends,
[3359.82 → 3360.60] God loves you
[3360.60 → 3361.76] and he is
[3361.76 → 3362.16] willing
[3362.16 → 3362.64] and he is
[3362.64 → 3363.26] able to
[3363.26 → 3363.70] produce
[3363.70 → 3364.64] his fruit
[3364.64 → 3366.04] in our lives
[3366.04 → 3366.64] when we rely
[3366.64 → 3367.00] on him
[3367.00 → 3367.34] and when we
[3367.34 → 3367.88] look to him.
[3370.22 → 3370.88] So I want
[3370.88 → 3371.38] to conclude
[3371.38 → 3372.66] with this
[3372.66 → 3373.06] poem
[3373.06 → 3374.54] by Malcolm
[3374.54 → 3374.88] Gwent.
[3376.28 → 3376.96] This is what
[3376.96 → 3377.30] it says.
[3377.40 → 3378.50] It's a sonnet.
[3379.64 → 3379.98] He says,
[3379.98 → 3380.92] So deep in me
[3380.92 → 3382.06] where I am
[3382.06 → 3383.06] thin and shallow,
[3383.96 → 3384.92] uproot in me
[3384.92 → 3385.62] the thistle
[3385.62 → 3386.38] and the thorn.
[3387.48 → 3388.24] Keep far
[3388.24 → 3388.94] from me
[3388.94 → 3389.72] that swiftly
[3389.72 → 3390.86] snatching shadow
[3390.86 → 3392.18] that seizes
[3392.18 → 3393.18] on your seed
[3393.18 → 3394.14] to mock
[3394.14 → 3394.74] and scorn.
[3395.94 → 3396.08] Oh,
[3396.14 → 3396.90] break me open,
[3397.02 → 3397.22] Jesus,
[3397.40 → 3398.08] set me free.
[3398.84 → 3399.64] Then find
[3399.64 → 3400.34] and keep
[3400.34 → 3401.16] your own
[3401.16 → 3401.88] good ground
[3401.88 → 3402.90] in me.
[3404.52 → 3405.08] Okay,
[3405.14 → 3405.58] let's pray.
[3409.98 → 3411.72] Father,
[3411.82 → 3412.18] we come
[3412.18 → 3412.84] before you
[3412.84 → 3415.00] and when we
[3415.00 → 3415.42] look at our
[3415.42 → 3415.98] own hearts
[3415.98 → 3416.70] we find
[3416.70 → 3417.98] all kinds
[3417.98 → 3418.36] of different
[3418.36 → 3418.78] soils.
[3419.44 → 3420.10] We can relate
[3420.10 → 3420.58] to each
[3420.58 → 3421.16] one
[3421.16 → 3422.24] in this
[3422.24 → 3422.64] parable.
[3424.72 → 3425.54] But Lord,
[3425.74 → 3426.60] we thank you
[3426.60 → 3427.34] that even
[3427.34 → 3428.70] by your grace
[3428.70 → 3429.22] you have
[3429.22 → 3429.84] given us
[3429.84 → 3430.46] the eyes
[3430.46 → 3430.84] to see,
[3430.94 → 3431.28] the ears
[3431.28 → 3431.88] to hear
[3431.88 → 3432.88] what you
[3432.88 → 3433.42] are saying
[3433.42 → 3433.84] and Lord,
[3434.50 → 3435.50] we desire
[3435.50 → 3436.08] to hear your
[3436.08 → 3436.62] word and Lord
[3436.62 → 3437.62] that's a sign,
[3437.84 → 3439.20] that's an
[3439.20 → 3439.74] assurance
[3439.74 → 3441.20] that your
[3441.20 → 3441.86] word is
[3441.86 → 3442.52] planted in
[3442.52 → 3443.02] our hearts.
[3444.40 → 3444.76] But Lord,
[3444.80 → 3445.16] we want to
[3445.16 → 3445.38] grow,
[3445.50 → 3445.78] we want to
[3445.78 → 3446.58] produce fruit
[3446.58 → 3448.62] in maturity.
[3449.88 → 3450.12] Lord,
[3450.16 → 3450.56] we need your
[3450.56 → 3451.48] help in this
[3451.48 → 3452.04] Christian life
[3452.04 → 3452.94] to follow you
[3452.94 → 3453.64] faithfully.
[3454.54 → 3454.98] So Lord,
[3455.04 → 3455.52] would you by
[3455.52 → 3456.10] your spirit
[3456.10 → 3457.06] hear our
[3457.06 → 3457.40] prayer
[3457.40 → 3458.64] and work
[3458.64 → 3458.98] in our
[3458.98 → 3459.36] hearts.
[3460.44 → 3460.82] Would you
[3460.82 → 3461.52] till us
[3461.52 → 3462.52] and garden
[3462.52 → 3463.22] us because
[3463.22 → 3463.64] you are the
[3463.64 → 3464.32] good gardener.
[3465.78 → 3466.28] And Lord,
[3466.34 → 3466.92] we look to you
[3466.92 → 3467.44] and we trust
[3467.44 → 3467.90] you in Jesus'
[3468.08 → 3468.26] name.
[3468.86 → 3469.16] Amen.
[3469.74 → 3470.26] Amen.
[3471.88 → 3472.56] All right,
[3472.62 → 3473.14] so let's
[3473.14 → 3473.48] stand.
[3473.66 → 3474.46] Let's sing
[3474.46 → 3475.04] our song
[3475.04 → 3475.50] of response.
[3475.64 → 3475.92] Speak,
[3476.06 → 3476.40] O Lord.
[3476.40 → 3476.98] Speak,
[3489.36 → 3494.36] O Lord.
[3494.36 → 3504.14] Speak, O Lord, as we come to you
[3504.14 → 3511.32] To receive the food of your holy word
[3511.32 → 3517.72] Take your truth, plant it deep in us
[3517.72 → 3524.62] Shame and fashion us in your likeness
[3524.62 → 3531.48] Let the light of Christ be seen today
[3531.48 → 3539.22] In our acts of love and our deeds of faith
[3539.22 → 3545.42] Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
[3545.42 → 3552.22] All your purposes for your glory
[3552.22 → 3566.22] Teach us, Lord, full obedience
[3566.22 → 3572.62] Holy reverence, true humility
[3572.62 → 3579.42] Test our thoughts and our attitudes
[3579.42 → 3586.42] In the radiance of your purity
[3586.42 → 3590.52] Cause our faith to rise
[3590.52 → 3593.42] Cause our eyes to see
[3593.42 → 3600.22] Your majesty, love, and authority
[3600.22 → 3607.42] Words of power that can never fail
[3607.42 → 3614.22] Let their truth reveal all around me
[3614.22 → 3629.02] Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds
[3629.02 → 3633.02] Help us grasp the heights of our plans for us
[3633.02 → 3639.82] True sun change
[3639.82 → 3642.62] From the dawn of time
[3642.62 → 3646.62] That will echo down through eternity
[3646.62 → 3657.42] And my grace to stand on your promises
[3657.42 → 3665.42] And my faith will walk as you walk with us
[3665.42 → 3672.22] Speak, O Lord, till your church is built
[3672.22 → 3679.02] And the earth is filled with your glory
[3679.02 → 3693.82] And the earth is filled with your glory
[3693.82 → 3696.02] I will continue our worship this morning
[3696.02 → 3697.22] By the giving of our tithes and offerings
[3697.22 → 3699.36] Our designated offering for this Sunday
[3699.36 → 3701.16] Is for a Delta Christian School
[3701.16 → 3705.88] An institution right down the street
[3705.88 → 3708.42] That has been very important to us
[3708.42 → 3710.40] And our church has been deeply involved in
[3710.40 → 3711.48] Over the decades
[3711.48 → 3716.12] And so, yeah, so we'll have the offering bag

[3780.88 → 3781.88] Amen.
[3810.88 → 3838.34] Please join me in prayer as we come before the Lord and pray for our community, our church, the world.
[3838.34 → 3839.34] Amen.
[3839.34 → 3840.34] Amen.
[3840.34 → 3848.34] Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the universe, sovereign over all things.
[3848.34 → 3854.06] Lord, first we give you thanks for Delta Christian School that has been in our community and serving
[3854.06 → 3856.06] our families for many decades.
[3856.06 → 3859.90] Lord, would you continue to grow that school.
[3859.90 → 3863.78] We thank you for the good growth we've seen over the recent years.
[3863.78 → 3872.06] And Lord, we pray that you would help them to equip children to know you and to live and
[3872.06 → 3874.78] follow you in this world.
[3874.78 → 3883.78] Lord, we also ask that you would help us as a community, Lord, to be hearers of your word.
[3883.78 → 3889.00] Would you walk with us each day as our shield and our strength?
[3889.00 → 3895.28] Would you teach us your truth and allow it to be written upon our hearts?
[3895.28 → 3901.56] Help us, Lord, to be a community that spurs one another on to love and good deeds.
[3901.56 → 3908.34] Help us to listen to your word and submit ourselves to live as you call us.
[3908.34 → 3916.10] Help us to recognize and hear your still soft voice when it urges us to humility and to love
[3916.10 → 3920.20] one another and to love our neighbours as ourselves.
[3920.20 → 3928.50] And help us, dear Lord, to experience your palpable presence and your everlasting peace.
[3928.50 → 3935.34] Lord, we also come before you and we lift the many needs of our community.
[3935.34 → 3941.62] Lord, many of your flock, your sheep, Lord, are struggling.
[3941.62 → 3951.26] Lord, we pray for Ian Klein as he recovers from his surgery.
[3951.26 → 3958.54] Lord, we pray for the baby son of Cody and Tara, who is in the Children's Hospital in Vancouver.
[3958.54 → 3966.82] Lord, would you come around that family, also be with the Hendrickson's as they look to you for healing.
[3967.82 → 3969.54] Lord, we pray for good treatments.
[3969.54 → 3970.88] We pray for full recovery.
[3972.32 → 3976.06] And Lord, we pray for all the family, that you would bless them and be with them,
[3976.48 → 3979.48] and that they would look to you for their strength in this time.
[3980.78 → 3982.36] Lord, be with Janet and her.
[3982.36 → 3990.92] Lord, as she recovers from her medical procedure she had, Lord, also be with Ellie as she recovers from her hip.
[3991.38 → 3994.38] Lord, would you grant her recovery and movement.
[3995.46 → 3999.28] Lord, be with her in her new home in White Rock.
[4000.80 → 4005.18] Lord, for all of us, Lord, you know the needs that we have.
[4005.62 → 4008.00] You know the worries of our hearts.
[4008.00 → 4014.34] You know the things that occupy our imaginations and our thoughts.
[4015.70 → 4019.86] And Lord, for each one of us, you know what we need, and would you come and meet us.
[4021.98 → 4025.76] Lord, we ask that you would hear all of our prayers.
[4026.44 → 4029.04] We pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4029.64 → 4029.98] Amen.
[4032.94 → 4033.70] Please stand.
[4033.70 → 4039.44] And our benediction today comes from Isaiah 55.
[4040.78 → 4041.78] It says this.
[4042.40 → 4044.80] As the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
[4045.46 → 4049.20] and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish,
[4049.98 → 4053.22] so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
[4053.78 → 4056.72] so, says the Lord, is my word that goes out from my mouth.
[4057.26 → 4058.86] It will not return to me empty,
[4058.86 → 4064.70] but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
[4065.12 → 4068.88] Brothers and sisters, go out in joy and be led forth in peace.

[4144.88 → 4146.88] Amen.
[4146.88 → 4152.50] Let your grace raise from your hand
[4152.50 → 4156.50] Fall on us
[4156.50 → 4165.38] Lord, let your grace raise from your hand
[4165.38 → 4169.00] Fall on us
[4169.00 → 4175.42] That we may be saved
[4175.42 → 4180.78] That we may apply

[4249.48 → 4252.48] Let your love
[4252.48 → 4257.54] Shine on us
[4257.54 → 4263.02] That we may have love
[4263.02 → 4267.04] That we may have life
[4267.82 → 4274.08] Be saved
[4274.08 → 4304.06] Thank you.
