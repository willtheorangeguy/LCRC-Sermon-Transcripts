[1649.62 → 1679.62] Thank you.
[1679.62 → 1709.60] Thank you.
[1709.60 → 1739.58] Good.
[1739.60 → 1769.58] Christ is born today.
[1769.58 → 1799.56] Thank you.
[1799.56 → 1829.54] Christ, you.
[1829.54 → 1859.52] Here we are.
[1859.52 → 1889.50] which is to have a B
[1889.50 → 1919.50] And so we are,
[1919.50 → 1949.48] Thank you.
[1949.48 → 1979.46] We pray.
[1979.46 → 2009.44] We'll see you.
[2009.44 → 2019.12] One of the reasons that's so surprising is that Matthew's genealogy mentions the names of five women.
[2028.24 → 2032.12] This is pretty unheard of in the ancient world.
[2032.12 → 2044.62] And what makes this even more surprising is that these are not the women you would have expected.
[2051.12 → 2055.32] These particular women are somewhat eye-bow raising.
[2055.32 → 2065.32] They are not the revered matriarchs of Israel, like Sarah or Rebecca.
[2065.32 → 2072.32] But instead, these women were outsiders in some way.
[2072.32 → 2079.32] They were outsiders, people like Tamar and Rehab and Ruth and Bathsheba.
[2079.32 → 2101.32] And over the last couple of weeks, we've looked at each one of their stories from the Old Testament during this Advent season.
[2101.32 → 2108.32] In the past few weeks, we've already understood the story of the Old Testament about the Old Testament.
[2108.32 → 2119.04] And so today, we are finishing up our series on the mothers of Jesus by looking at the fifth woman that Matthew mentions, who is, of course, Mary.
[2119.04 → 2126.04] Today, we're going to use the fifth woman's family.
[2126.04 → 2133.14] And it is the Gospel of Luke that gives us the fullest picture of Mary.
[2133.14 → 2137.44] In the Luke's book, we've also explained the whole story of Mary.
[2137.44 → 2140.08] So, let's turn our attention to God's word.
[2140.44 → 2142.54] If you have a Bible, I welcome you to open it.
[2143.44 → 2146.70] And if you have the Bibles in your pews, we will also have the words up on the screen.
[2147.94 → 2154.06] So, we will read 1 Matthew 1, verse 16.
[2155.94 → 2160.14] It says this, continuing the very last bit of the genealogy.
[2160.14 → 2169.28] It says, and Jacob, the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus, who was called the Messiah.
[2171.90 → 2172.84] Oh, sorry. Go back.
[2173.90 → 2175.28] Oh, yeah. Do you want to do Chinese?
[2175.84 → 2176.94] No, you guys can read it. Never mind.
[2176.94 → 2177.06] Yeah.
[2177.22 → 2178.00] Okay, Luke. Luke.
[2178.56 → 2179.34] Here we go, Luke.
[2180.00 → 2187.42] And in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
[2187.42 → 2192.46] to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[2193.22 → 2195.24] The virgin's name was Mary.
[2196.32 → 2198.14] The angel went to her and said,
[2198.44 → 2200.90] Greetings, you who are highly favoured.
[2201.48 → 2203.36] The Lord is with you.
[2204.48 → 2209.06] Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[2209.92 → 2211.14] But the angel said to her,
[2211.70 → 2212.92] Do not be afraid, Mary.
[2213.00 → 2214.68] You have found favour with God.
[2214.68 → 2220.58] You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[2221.54 → 2225.20] He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[2225.64 → 2232.36] The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[2232.92 → 2235.36] His kingdom will never end.
[2235.36 → 2240.90] How will this be, Mary asked, since I am a virgin?
[2242.02 → 2243.14] The angel answered,
[2243.52 → 2245.02] The Holy Spirit will come on you.
[2245.38 → 2247.98] The power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[2248.48 → 2252.54] So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[2252.54 → 2257.30] Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.
[2257.76 → 2262.18] And she, who is said to be unable to conceive, is in her sixth month.
[2262.66 → 2265.76] For no word from God will ever fail.
[2267.14 → 2270.36] I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.
[2270.88 → 2272.50] May your word to me be fulfilled.
[2273.48 → 2274.90] Then the angel left her.
[2275.54 → 2276.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[2277.64 → 2278.92] Thanks be to God.
[2278.92 → 2286.40] One of the Christmas books I remember reading as a kid is called the best Christmas,
[2286.98 → 2289.10] I should say word, the best, yeah, the best.
[2289.28 → 2291.28] The best Christmas pageant ever.
[2292.46 → 2298.24] I read a book about the Christmas book called the World's greatest Christmas book.
[2298.42 → 2299.24] Have you read it?
[2299.90 → 2301.00] Has anyone ever read it?
[2302.38 → 2303.12] Yeah, some people?
[2303.52 → 2303.76] A couple?
[2304.24 → 2304.44] No?
[2304.80 → 2305.30] Mostly not.
[2305.42 → 2305.94] Yeah, okay.
[2306.46 → 2307.48] A couple of yeses, a couple of noes.
[2307.54 → 2307.68] Good.
[2308.92 → 2313.50] The book is about a family of six kids named the Herman's.
[2314.14 → 2315.60] This book is about a family of six kids named the Herman's.
[2315.60 → 2317.32] This book is about a family of six kids named the Herman's.
[2317.32 → 2322.84] They are the worst kids ever.
[2323.60 → 2325.62] This家的小孩糟糕透了.
[2325.96 → 2328.00] So kids, don't be like the Herman's.
[2328.78 → 2329.22] Okay.
[2329.22 → 2331.62] They lie.
[2332.26 → 2333.62] They lie.
[2333.62 → 2334.26] They cheat.
[2334.60 → 2335.32] They cheat.
[2335.54 → 2336.30] They steal.
[2336.30 → 2337.92] They cuss.
[2337.92 → 2337.98] They cuss.
[2338.52 → 2341.52] They punch little kids.
[2341.52 → 2346.02] They burned down a building.
[2346.52 → 2348.10] They burned down a building.
[2348.10 → 2348.96] They burned down a building.
[2348.96 → 2350.62] And they smoke cigars.
[2350.62 → 2351.76] They smoke cigars.
[2352.54 → 2354.66] They are the most terrible kids ever.
[2354.86 → 2356.80] They are the most terrible kids ever.
[2356.80 → 2367.48] So it is with great shock and dismay of everyone when the Herman's decide that they're going to sign up for the annual local church Christmas pageant.
[2367.48 → 2380.64] When the Herman's does not know that this is going to be a complete disaster.
[2380.64 → 2391.48] This is going to be the worst Christmas pageant ever.
[2391.86 → 2391.94] Yeah.
[2392.78 → 2395.44] This is going to be the worst Christmas pageant ever.
[2395.44 → 2409.56] But too much to everyone's surprise, the Herman's, it turns out, actually suddenly bring all of this life and authenticity to the pageant, making it one of the best pageants ever.
[2409.56 → 2423.94] But the most important thing is that Herman's is the most terrible people's experience.
[2423.94 → 2426.08] So here's what the narrator says in the story.
[2426.08 → 2437.06] Instead of ruining it, it seems like the Herman's had improved the pageant a lot, just by doing what came naturally.
[2438.70 → 2443.06] Herman's' family, they were not able to make this production.
[2443.06 → 2445.06] They were able to make this production.
[2445.06 → 2452.44] They did things like burping the baby Jesus.
[2452.44 → 2482.42] They were just real people.
[2482.44 → 2484.44] What is the real people?
[2484.44 → 2485.44] Real people.
[2485.44 → 2485.94] Real people.
[2485.94 → 2486.44] Real people.
[2486.44 → 2487.44] Real people.
[2487.44 → 2488.44] Real people.
[2488.44 → 2489.44] Real people.
[2489.44 → 2490.44] Real people.
[2490.44 → 2491.44] Real people.
[2491.44 → 2492.44] Real people.
[2492.44 → 2493.44] Real people.
[2493.44 → 2494.44] And we've heard this Christmas story.
[2494.44 → 2495.44] If you've been a Christian for a while, we've heard this so many times.
[2495.44 → 2496.44] We've heard this so many times.
[2496.44 → 2497.44] Right?
[2497.44 → 2505.44] And we get, and these stories are so wrapped up in the holidays, in the romanticism of the Christmas holiday celebration.
[2505.44 → 2510.44] They were given a holiday, or a holiday.
[2510.44 → 2516.44] And so because of that, we sometimes forget that the people in these stories were real people.
[2516.44 → 2529.44] And so these people that we read about are just like us.
[2529.44 → 2536.44] We actually look at Mary in the scriptures.
[2536.44 → 2540.44] We see that she is a real person.
[2540.44 → 2547.44] When we read about Mary's Bible, she is a real person.
[2547.44 → 2555.44] And yet, Mary becomes the first person not only to hear the Christmas message, but to receive it.
[2555.44 → 2561.44] And Mary is the first person who hears the message, and is the first person who hears the message.
[2561.44 → 2568.44] So one of the things I love about Luke's account is that in this passage, we get Mary's perspective.
[2568.44 → 2571.44] In the book of Luke's book, I love the most.
[2571.44 → 2575.44] We can feel that Mary's perspective.
[2575.44 → 2580.44] We hear Mary's thoughts, and we hear her feelings.
[2580.44 → 2583.44] We hear Mary's thoughts, and we hear her feelings.
[2583.44 → 2590.44] We hear Mary's response to the message, and to the meaning of Christmas.
[2590.44 → 2592.44] We hear Mary's thoughts, and songs and feelings.
[2592.44 → 2594.44] We hear Mary's thoughts, and we hear Mary's thoughts, and to the meaning of Christmas.
[2594.44 → 2596.44] We hear Mary's thoughts, and we hear Mary's thoughts.
[2596.44 → 2601.44] And if there is anyone who can help us grasp the meaning, and the significance of Christmas, it is Mary.
[2601.44 → 2608.44] If there is a Christmas message, it is Mary.
[2608.44 → 2616.44] Because she is the first person to receive the Christmas message herself.
[2616.44 → 2622.44] Because she is the first person to receive the Christmas message herself.
[2622.44 → 2626.44] So this morning, let's look at this astonishing woman, Mary.
[2626.44 → 2630.44] And let's look at her response to the Christmas message.
[2630.44 → 2635.44] Today, let's look at this young woman, Mary.
[2635.44 → 2639.44] Let's look at her response to the message.
[2639.44 → 2648.44] Let's look at how we can respond and how we can receive this message in the same way.
[2648.44 → 2655.44] First, we see in Mary a response of wonder.
[2655.44 → 2658.44] So we actually don't know much about Mary.
[2658.44 → 2665.44] We know that she is a young girl, probably 14 or 15 years old.
[2665.44 → 2674.44] She lives in an insignificant village.
[2674.44 → 2683.44] Right? Far away from the centres of power and of piety.
[2683.44 → 2689.44] Her family of origin is never mentioned.
[2689.44 → 2691.44] Her family of origin is never mentioned.
[2691.44 → 2699.44] And the way that Luke tells the story, the most significant thing about Mary is her insignificance.
[2699.44 → 2704.44] In the Vacuumarah boxes in secret heatedness only, the most significant thing about Mary's decorate is his, too.
[2704.44 → 2709.34] And yet, she is the one given favour by God.
[2713.30 → 2715.56] So verse 28 says this.
[2715.56 → 2717.46] The angel went to her and said,
[2717.60 → 2719.30] Greetings, you who are highly favoured.
[2719.40 → 2720.34] The Lord is with you.
[2721.02 → 2724.14] Mary was greatly troubled at his words
[2724.14 → 2726.48] and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[2727.76 → 2731.64] So notice that she hasn't gotten the news yet
[2731.64 → 2734.00] that she is going to bear God's child.
[2734.44 → 2743.18] So why does it say that Mary is troubled?
[2743.70 → 2747.34] What is she trying to make sense of?
[2750.08 → 2752.78] It says she is troubled by the greeting.
[2757.80 → 2759.80] She says, Who, me?
[2759.80 → 2762.48] She asks, Who, me?
[2762.86 → 2763.10] Right?
[2763.46 → 2765.14] I am favoured by God?
[2765.56 → 2766.30] Why me?
[2766.54 → 2766.60] Sorry.
[2766.60 → 2774.10] I don't deserve this at all.
[2774.30 → 2775.94] I'm just a girl living in the country.
[2776.40 → 2778.46] I am not anybody important.
[2778.46 → 2779.06] I am a servant.
[2779.06 → 2779.80] I am a servant.
[2779.80 → 2780.80] I am a servant.
[2781.28 → 2781.52] I am a servant.
[2781.52 → 2782.20] I am a servant.
[2782.20 → 2783.12] I am a servant.
[2783.12 → 2783.74] I am a servant.
[2783.74 → 2784.82] I am a servant.
[2785.82 → 2787.80] And yet, God comes to Mary.
[2788.16 → 2792.88] And he says, Mary, I am giving you my favour and grace.
[2792.96 → 2794.28] I have come to be with you.
[2794.28 → 2814.42] So friends, the true miracle of Christmas, the true miracle of this story is that God comes, and he makes his home among us in this world.
[2815.18 → 2829.20] This story, which is
[2829.20 → 2836.20] with dirt and manure on the floor.
[2836.20 → 2846.20] God comes to an insignificant girl from a no-name family in a nothing village.
[2846.20 → 2858.20] God doesn't choose the one who has a position of prestige and power.
[2858.20 → 2865.20] He chooses Mary.
[2865.20 → 2874.20] And so on a cultural scale of value, her gender, her age, her family background, her possessions,
[2874.20 → 2878.20] all of this makes Mary rank the lowest.
[2878.20 → 2895.20] And yet, God chooses to love Mary, and He chooses to bestow His grace on her.
[2895.20 → 2910.20] God chooses Mary as it were for no good reason other than to display His grace.
[2910.20 → 2917.20] And friends, that's how grace comes to us as well.
[2917.20 → 2924.20] The message of Christmas is that we don't do anything to deserve it.
[2924.20 → 2931.20] The message of Jesus is that we don't need to do anything to deserve it.
[2931.20 → 2939.20] God just simply gives us His love and mercy freely.
[2939.20 → 2942.20] So friend, here is the question for us.
[2942.20 → 2946.20] Does that cause you to wonder?
[2946.20 → 2959.20] When you think about God coming to you, saving you, pardoning your sins, coming into your life,
[2959.20 → 2974.20] do you say, who me?
[2974.20 → 2975.20] Why me?
[2975.20 → 2976.20] I don't deserve this.
[2976.20 → 2981.20] I don't deserve God's favour to come to me.
[2981.20 → 2992.20] We will say, God comes to you the same way He came to Mary.
[2992.20 → 2996.20] He comes to us as you are, not as you should be.
[2996.20 → 3005.20] God comes to us as you are, not as you should be.
[3005.20 → 3009.20] And friends, that is the greatest gift that any of us can ever receive on this Christmas
[3009.20 → 3014.20] or any other Christmas, that God's favour has come to us.
[3014.20 → 3020.20] The Lord's grace and the presence of the Lord's grace is the best gift we received.
[3020.20 → 3027.20] So the second response that we see in Mary is a response of honest questioning.
[3027.20 → 3031.20] The second response that we see in Mary is a response of honest questioning.
[3031.20 → 3035.20] So this response can seem a little surprising to us.
[3035.20 → 3042.20] We see Mary questioning this message.
[3042.20 → 3051.20] So after the angel Gabriel meets Mary, he greets her, he gives her this message.
[3051.20 → 3058.20] So in verse 31, Gabriel said,
[3058.20 → 3064.20] You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[3064.20 → 3067.20] He will be great and will be called the son of the most high.
[3067.20 → 3070.20] The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
[3070.20 → 3073.20] and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[3073.20 → 3075.20] His kingdom will never end.
[3075.20 → 3082.20] Now, try to put yourself in Mary's shoes.
[3082.20 → 3087.20] Now, try to put yourself in Mary's shoes.
[3087.20 → 3091.20] What would she have heard when she heard these words?
[3091.20 → 3093.20] Malaya, she heard these words.
[3093.20 → 3095.20] She will be like, what would she have heard?
[3095.20 → 3101.20] Unlike Ruth and Bathsheba and Rehab and Tamar, Mary is Jewish.
[3101.20 → 3103.20] Malaya, she is a Jewish.
[3103.20 → 3108.20] And thousands of years before this, God had made a promise to the great king David.
[3108.20 → 3117.20] In 2 Samuel chapter 7, God made a promise to David.
[3117.20 → 3121.20] In 2 Samuel chapter 7, God made a promise to David.
[3121.20 → 3123.20] In 2 Samuel chapter 7, God made a promise to David.
[3123.20 → 3130.20] He said, Out of your line, I am going to bring a special king, the Messiah.
[3130.20 → 3149.20] This king was going to be a good and righteous king, who would bring true justice and true healing and true joy and peace into the world.
[3149.20 → 3167.20] This king would come to make the world right again, and he would reign forever.
[3167.20 → 3176.20] So this promise was given all of those years ago.
[3176.20 → 3179.20] This is a few years ago.
[3179.20 → 3192.20] And for generations, after generations, after generations, after generations, after generations, after generations, the Jewish people have been waiting and longing for God to fulfill this promise.
[3192.20 → 3199.20] And Mary herself has been waiting for God to fulfill this promise.
[3199.20 → 3202.20] Malaya, he is also not a miracle.
[3202.20 → 3206.20] She has been hearing this promise ever since she was a little girl.
[3206.20 → 3211.20] She has been hearing this promise ever since she was a little girl.
[3211.20 → 3214.20] She has heard it from the scriptures being read.
[3214.20 → 3219.20] She has heard it from her parents, from her grandparents.
[3219.20 → 3221.20] She has heard it from the grandparents.
[3221.20 → 3224.20] She has heard it from the grandparents.
[3224.20 → 3231.20] So Mary, as a Jew, she is waiting for God to fulfill this promise given so long ago.
[3231.20 → 3238.20] We can imagine that as a Jew, as a Jew, Mary has been waiting for her.
[3238.20 → 3244.20] So you can imagine her shock when this angel appears to her.
[3244.20 → 3246.20] So we can imagine when the angel appears to her.
[3246.20 → 3249.20] And this angel comes and says,
[3249.20 → 3256.20] Mary, this king that you and your people have been waiting for a thousand years is about to show up.
[3256.20 → 3257.20] And guess what?
[3257.20 → 3262.20] You are going to be his mother.
[3262.20 → 3277.20] What would you have said to that?
[3277.20 → 3278.20] What?
[3278.20 → 3288.20] What would she be feeling at this moment?
[3288.20 → 3291.20] Probably scared?
[3291.20 → 3295.20] Maybe just overwhelmed or confused, amazed.
[3295.20 → 3298.20] Probably had a thousand questions.
[3298.20 → 3300.20] Right?
[3300.20 → 3307.20] And the thing about Mary that I love is she is not afraid.
[3307.20 → 3310.20] to ask a question.
[3310.20 → 3312.20] She says in verse 34, she says,
[3312.20 → 3317.20] How will this be since I am a virgin?
[3317.20 → 3320.20] Good question.
[3320.20 → 3326.20] And it shows us that Mary is a sharp young woman.
[3326.20 → 3331.20] You can imagine Mary is a sharp young woman.
[3331.20 → 3336.20] She cannot simply draw her.
[3336.20 → 3339.20] She cannot simply just believe what she is hearing.
[3339.20 → 3342.20] And she is reacting the way that you or I might react.
[3342.20 → 3345.20] She is reacting the way that you or I might react.
[3345.20 → 3348.20] You know, like, what in the world?
[3348.20 → 3350.20] This is what in the world?
[3350.20 → 3352.20] God, what are you doing?
[3352.20 → 3353.20] God, what are you doing?
[3353.20 → 3356.20] How can I make sense of this?
[3356.20 → 3358.20] I can understand this.
[3358.20 → 3359.20] Right?
[3359.20 → 3361.20] So, Mary is not this primitive pushover.
[3361.20 → 3362.20] So, Mary is not this primitive pushover.
[3362.20 → 3366.20] Aaliyah, 她并非是古代那种逆来顺受的女子.
[3366.20 → 3367.20] Right?
[3367.20 → 3368.20] She is wrestling with this news.
[3368.20 → 3369.20] She is wrestling with this news.
[3369.20 → 3370.20] She is asking questions.
[3370.20 → 3372.20] She is asking questions.
[3372.20 → 3375.20] She is thinking it through.
[3375.20 → 3376.20] She is asking questions.
[3376.20 → 3377.20] She is asking questions.
[3377.20 → 3378.20] And she is very bold.
[3378.20 → 3382.20] She is pushing back on the angel.
[3382.20 → 3385.20] She is pushing back on the angel.
[3385.20 → 3386.20] Would you do that?
[3386.20 → 3387.20] I don't know.
[3387.20 → 3392.20] She is trying to get to the truth.
[3392.20 → 3393.20] She is asking questions.
[3393.20 → 3394.20] Right?
[3394.20 → 3395.20] No nonsense.
[3395.20 → 3396.20] Like, what are we talking about?
[3396.20 → 3397.20] What does this mean?
[3397.20 → 3398.20] What's going on?
[3398.20 → 3406.20] So, we're so used to this message that God became a man and dwelt among us.
[3406.20 → 3413.20] We're so used to seeing this message that God became a man and dwelt among us.
[3413.20 → 3414.20] Right?
[3414.20 → 3419.20] We're so used to seeing this message that the creator became the created.
[3419.20 → 3424.20] close then, the god who created the universe entered into it.
[3424.20 → 3426.20] The god who created the universe entered into it.
[3426.20 → 3427.20] Who created the universe entered into it.
[3427.20 → 3431.20] But when we stop and think about it, this is a wild claim.
[3431.20 → 3432.20] So, we'll be so silent to say it.
[3432.20 → 3433.20] That's a wild claim!
[3433.20 → 3436.20] This is an awesome statement.
[3436.20 → 3437.20] Yeah, friends.
[3437.20 → 3440.20] So, it would make sense that you have questions about it.
[3440.20 → 3443.20] That might tell you if we were wondering.
[3443.20 → 3444.20] A question about it.
[3444.20 → 3446.20] May Allah have as many questions.
[3446.20 → 3448.20] That recognition that you would have some doubts.
[3448.20 → 3455.20] You can do this sometimes.
[3455.20 → 3467.20] So friends, if that is you this morning, you have good company with Mary.
[3467.20 → 3472.20] She is boldly seeking after the truth.
[3472.20 → 3484.20] So the challenge that Mary confronts us with is not just to be a person who shows up for Christmas, for worship on Christmas Day, maybe just simply had a tradition.
[3484.20 → 3491.20] 玛利亚给我们带来的挑战不仅仅是作为一个遵循圣诞传统参加敬拜的人。
[3491.20 → 3500.20] If this Christmas message is true, that God became a man in order to save us, then everything has changed.
[3500.20 → 3507.20] 如果神成了人的形象是为了拯救, 那么一切都将发生变化。
[3507.20 → 3518.20] And if this is true, you need to give everything you have to respond to this God who has given everything to come to you.
[3518.20 → 3522.20] 如果这是真的, 那么一切都将改变。
[3522.20 → 3530.20] 我们需要献上我们自己的一切来回应神, 因为神付出的一切来到我们的面前。
[3530.20 → 3540.20] 让我们像玛利亚一样追寻真理, 诚实地说出自己的疑惑。
[3540.20 → 3549.20] 最后我们来看看玛利亚她回应的勇气, 也是勇气的回应。
[3549.20 → 3556.20] 最后呢, 虽然玛利亚她还在纠结神为什么讲恩典于她。
[3556.20 → 3564.20] 她提问, 她也内心很挣扎。
[3564.20 → 3569.20] 但是在决定的时刻, 她还是选择了降服于她。
[3569.20 → 3579.20] 但是在决定的时刻, 她还是选择了降服于神。
[3579.20 → 3586.20] 她说, 我也是神的徒徒,可你的言为我来自成功。
[3586.20 → 3590.20] 这些是很名的词。
[3590.20 → 3595.20] 我们有时会看起来, 他们真的有很吓励。
[3595.20 → 3598.20] 这是非常著名的章节。
[3598.20 → 3600.20] 因为真的有时候我们会忽略她的话。
[3600.20 → 3603.20] 因为在我们看来, 她肯定会这么说。
[3603.20 → 3608.20] 因为她将成为弥赛亚的母亲。
[3608.20 → 3613.20] 但是事实如何呢?
[3613.20 → 3627.20] 实际上呢, 玛利亚是在本质上同意将她的生活完全地扩养。
[3627.20 → 3629.20] 她允许自己的生活完全地改变。
[3629.20 → 3643.20] 她允许自己的生活被打乱, 并且放弃了自己对生活的控制权。
[3643.20 → 3648.20] 她将会在她的生活上。
[3648.20 → 3653.20] 她将会向她的未婚夫约瑟来解释这件事呢?
[3653.20 → 3659.20] 她将会向她的父母公婆来解释这个事。
[3659.20 → 3664.20] 她如何面对她的朋友和生活的社区?
[3664.20 → 3665.20] 她如何面对她的朋友和生活的社区?
[3665.20 → 3668.20] 她将会在她的生活中的生活中的这个阻力,
[3668.20 → 3670.20] 这些疑惊在她的身体里面,
[3670.20 → 3680.20] 未婚先孕将会成为她一身的污点。
[3680.20 → 3682.20] 这个问题将一直在她的心头营绕。
[3682.20 → 3688.20] 更不要提我们可以抚养弥赛亚吗?
[3688.20 → 3693.20] 她可以胜任这份工作吗?
[3693.20 → 3694.20] 她可以胜任这份工作吗?
[3694.20 → 3707.20] 可能会有更加合适的, 更加有资格的人来承担这份义务。
[3707.20 → 3711.20] 尽管她有这些担心和不确定性。
[3711.20 → 3715.20] 她有这些担心和不确定性。
[3715.20 → 3722.20] 她仍然有胆量和勇气回应。
[3722.20 → 3727.20] 让我们这样做吧, 让我做神的使女。
[3727.20 → 3731.20] 我让我做神的使女。
[3731.20 → 3735.20] 她在那一刻, 她相信了,她也幸福了。
[3735.20 → 3739.20] 神看顾她, 神看顾她,神看顾她。
[3739.20 → 3744.20] 她相信了, 她也幸福了。
[3744.20 → 3749.20] 神看顾她, 神爱她,神来, 是为与她同在。
[3749.20 → 3754.20] 因此她倚靠于神。
[3754.20 → 3756.20] 她说, 她是主的使女。
[3756.20 → 3766.20] 她说, 她是主的使女。
[3766.20 → 3768.20] 她说, 她是主的使女。
[3768.20 → 3770.20] 她说, 玛利亚。
[3770.20 → 3780.20] 她不仅仅是耶稣基督的母亲, 她也是第一位基督徒。
[3780.20 → 3781.20] 玛利亚。
[3781.20 → 3786.20] 她向我们展示基督徒要怎么做。
[3786.20 → 3788.20] 她说, 她说,她说, 她说,我没有什么意思。
[3788.20 → 3789.20] 她说, 我没有什么意思。
[3789.20 → 3790.20] 我没有什么意思。
[3790.20 → 3791.20] 我没有什么意思。
[3791.20 → 3792.20] 我没有什么意思。
[3792.20 → 3793.20] 我没有什么意思。
[3793.20 → 3794.20] 但我看到你所做的事。
[3794.20 → 3796.20] 她说, 我给你我的生命。
[3796.20 → 3798.20] 我是神的使女。
[3798.20 → 3799.20] 我的口 Ashoka。
[3799.20 → 3801.20] 她说他向我们展示。
[3801.20 → 3804.20] 即使我们不明白神有和神义。
[3804.20 → 3807.20] 我们也不知道我们向何种结果而相浮。
[3807.20 → 3810.20] 但是我们凭着主对我们所做的。
[3810.20 → 3812.20] 祝上我们的生命。
[3812.20 → 3813.20] 我是主的仆人。
[3813.20 → 3815.20] 她们诞衩送我们我 Deus。
[3815.20 → 3816.20] 她说的仵佛。
[3816.20 → 3819.20] 佣湾就是额永远,
[3819.20 → 3820.20] 佣湾成人类仁。
[3820.20 → 3821.20] 努香。
[3821.20 → 3823.20] 佣湾成人。
[3823.20 → 3827.20] 佣湾成人会。
[3827.20 → 3828.20] 佣湾成人。
[3828.20 → 3838.20] 当我们把我们的命运从我们人的小手中交到主的大手中, 我们才会明白万事都会向好的方面发展。
[3838.20 → 3847.20] 因为它不在于你手中, 结局在于神的手中。
[3847.20 → 3854.20] 你会如何地回应呢?
[3854.20 → 3858.20] 会如何地回应呢?
[3858.20 → 3866.20] 你会像玛利亚一样降服, 让主掌握你的生活吗?
[3866.20 → 3870.20] 会像玛利亚一样降服吗?
[3870.20 → 3878.20] 会把我们的生活完全交托于主的手中吗?
[3878.20 → 3882.20] 会说我们是主的仆人吗?
[3882.20 → 3886.20] 这就是基督徒的意义。
[3886.20 → 3892.20] 让我们再次回到史上最棒的圣诞演出, 以她做今天的结尾。
[3892.20 → 3898.20] 让我们再次回到史上最棒的圣诞演出, 以她做今天的结尾。
[3898.20 → 3906.20] 在赫德曼家族中, 一抹金是最糟糕的那个孩子。
[3906.20 → 3909.20] 她口吐芬芳。
[3909.20 → 3912.20] 她霸凌恶心。
[3912.20 → 3917.20] 并且她是这群小恶霸的首脑。
[3917.20 → 3926.20] 自然呢, 她演出的时候,她就要求演出那个最重要的角色。
[3926.20 → 3929.20] 哪个角色?
[3929.20 → 3931.20] 玛利亚。
[3931.20 → 3947.20] 在卓西服彩排时, 当智者试图靠近婴儿借苏,送她礼物的时候, 一抹金一拳倒向他们的鼻子。
[3947.20 → 3953.20] 让他们远离自己的宝宝。
[3953.20 → 3959.20] 没有人想到这个演出会成功。
[3959.20 → 3971.20] 但是呢, 令大家震惊的是,当一抹金搬成玛利亚抱着婴儿耶稣的时候。
[3971.20 → 3977.20] 当她开始哼唱平安夜歌之时,
[3977.20 → 3980.20] 一抹金开始哭了。
[3980.20 → 3983.20] 叙述者说,
[3983.20 → 3993.20] 她坐在包裹她的面纱之中, 止不住地哭泣。
[3993.20 → 3998.20] 圣诞就如一阵寒意般, 向她掠过。
[3998.20 → 4002.20] 圣诞就如一阵寒意般, 向她掠过。
[4002.20 → 4014.20] 她突然领受了神的心意, 就是圣诞的奇迹。
[4014.20 → 4021.20] 圣诞的神迹就是我们所期望和祷告的。
[4021.20 → 4030.20] 圣诞的福音不在于为那些拥有一切的人聚集在一起。
[4030.20 → 4044.20] 她是为那些将自己掩面在面纱之中灰心丧气的人,
[4044.20 → 4049.20] 是为了那些需要被救赎的人而准备的。
[4049.20 → 4050.20] 。
[4050.20 → 4051.20] 和我们所谓的。
[4051.20 → 4056.20] 当我们所谓的在面纱之中呐, 那是我们所有的。
[4056.20 → 4058.20] 这些是我们所谓的。
[4058.20 → 4059.20] 我们就是这所有的人。
[4059.20 → 4060.20] 。
[4060.20 → 4061.20] 。
[4061.20 → 4062.20] 。
[4062.20 → 4063.20] 。
[4063.20 → 4066.20] 。
[4066.20 → 4067.20] 。
[4067.20 → 4068.20] 。
[4068.20 → 4069.20] 。
[4069.20 → 4070.20] 。
[4070.20 → 4071.20] 。
[4071.20 → 4074.20] 。
[4074.20 → 4076.20] 。
[4076.20 → 4090.06] If you want to accept our own grace, would you honestly wrestle and struggle with the Christian faith?
[4090.18 → 4093.26] Will you ask your questions? Will you seek the truth?
[4098.12 → 4105.06] And then would you surrender your life to this baby king as your Lord?
[4106.20 → 4114.40] Let's pray.
[4116.88 → 4118.38] We praise you, God, for Mary.
[4122.94 → 4127.96] We praise you for this astonishing young woman and for the example she is to us.
[4133.08 → 4135.48] She shows us what it means to be a Christian.
[4135.48 → 4140.48] They show us what it means to know that we need rescue.
[4143.38 → 4146.42] And then despite all of our questions, we trustingly surrender.
[4146.42 → 4152.16] And regardless of what we have to be concerned, we will be able to give ourselves to the Lord.
[4152.32 → 4158.70] So I pray that you would give each one of us this morning the same kind of faith that you gave Mary.
[4158.70 → 4165.98] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4165.98 → 4166.06] Amen.
[4166.26 → 4166.64] Amen.
[4166.64 → 4169.28] All right.
[4170.34 → 4176.32] I hope that slow sermon gave you lots of time to think.
[4176.32 → 4180.26] But let's stand now and let's sing our song of response.
[4180.26 → 4180.46] Amen.
[4180.46 → 4180.48] Amen.
[4180.48 → 4180.52] Amen.
[4180.52 → 4180.76] Amen.
[4180.76 → 4181.62] Amen.
[4181.62 → 4182.22] Amen.
[4182.22 → 4182.52] Amen.
[4182.52 → 4182.54] Amen.
[4182.54 → 4182.60] Amen.
[4182.60 → 4182.66] Amen.
[4182.66 → 4186.48] Amen.
[4190.02 → 4190.98] p problems.
[4191.12 → 4192.90] Amen.
[4192.90 → 4193.06] Amen.
[4197.02 → 4197.78] Amen.
[4203.78 → 4206.28] Amen.
[4206.28 → 4216.28] .
[4236.28 → 4240.72] While shepherds kept their watching,
[4240.72 → 4245.62] O silent flocks by night,
[4246.18 → 4249.72] Behold, throughout the heavens
[4250.32 → 4256.88] There shone a holy light.
[4257.66 → 4261.44] Go down there on the mountain,
[4261.44 → 4266.80] Over the hills and every day,
[4266.80 → 4271.24] Go down there on the mountain,
[4271.24 → 4276.60] That Jesus Christ is born.
[4276.60 → 4280.34] The shepherds' fear,
[4280.34 → 4282.24] Gains' rumble,
[4282.24 → 4287.00] When low above the earth,
[4287.00 → 4292.36] Rack the age of glory,
[4292.36 → 4295.24] Thy hail, your Saviour,
[4295.24 → 4298.80] Is birthed.
[4298.80 → 4304.16] Go down there on the mountain,
[4304.16 → 4309.16] Over the hills and every way,
[4309.16 → 4313.56] Go down there on the mountain,
[4313.56 → 4318.92] That Jesus Christ is born.
[4318.92 → 4322.92] Go down there on the mountain,
[4322.92 → 4325.36] The sea of the mountain,
[4325.36 → 4329.60] Our humble Christ was born,
[4329.60 → 4333.92] And God sent us salvation,
[4333.92 → 4339.92] That blessed Christmas born.
[4339.92 → 4345.28] Go down there on the mountain,
[4345.28 → 4351.28] Over the hills and every way,
[4351.28 → 4356.28] Go down there on the mountain,
[4356.28 → 4361.28] That Jesus Christ is born.
[4361.28 → 4373.64] So we'll continue our worship this morning
[4373.64 → 4376.64] by the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4376.64 → 4380.14] Of course, God gave us the greatest gift ever.
[4380.96 → 4384.88] And so we respond by becoming gift givers as well,
[4384.96 → 4386.68] as we're transformed by his grace.
[4386.68 → 4393.04] So I've invited Marian to come up and just give us a quick explanation of our designated offering for today.
[4393.04 → 4398.04] A minute ago he asked me to do this.
[4398.04 → 4400.04] So I haven't really given it a lot of thought.
[4400.04 → 4401.04] But as you know,
[4401.04 → 4405.04] I am champion for World Renew in this congregation.
[4405.04 → 4406.04] And as you know,
[4406.04 → 4414.04] We have had tags on the tree out in the foyer that you could take and use for your gift giving using the World Renew catalogue.
[4414.04 → 4420.40] Today you could do the same thing, and perhaps you've come prepared with a designated gift.
[4420.40 → 4424.40] If not, you can still give whatever you'd like.
[4424.40 → 4426.80] And I would like to suggest to the deacons,
[4426.80 → 4428.80] And I think maybe this is a good idea for today,
[4428.80 → 4433.80] That we would take whatever we get that is not designated to a specific gift.
[4433.80 → 4436.00] And then we will pick one of the big ones.
[4436.00 → 4437.28] What do you think?
[4437.28 → 4444.64] We'll just pick something huge for a community and out of the catalogue that whatever we can do.
[4444.64 → 4448.28] Okay, so however that works for you,
[4448.28 → 4454.04] Whether you've already designated a gift or you just want to be part of a bigger gift today.
[4454.04 → 4456.28] Thank you for your giving.
[4456.28 → 4462.28] While the offering is being taken,
[4462.28 → 4465.28] We're going to sing together a song called,
[4465.28 → 4468.28] What Can I Give Him?
[4468.28 → 4472.28] May will lead by singing the first stanza.
[4472.28 → 4474.28] And then we'll sing together,
[4474.28 → 4478.28] First stanza one again, as well as two.
[4478.28 → 4498.28] What can I give him?
[4498.28 → 4503.28] Poor I sighed.
[4503.28 → 4515.28] If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb.
[4515.28 → 4525.28] If I were a west man, I would do my part.
[4525.28 → 4531.28] Yes, what can I give him?
[4531.28 → 4537.28] Give him my heart.
[4537.28 → 4544.28] What can I give him?
[4544.28 → 4550.28] Poor as I am.
[4550.28 → 4562.28] If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb.
[4562.28 → 4573.28] If I were a west man, I would do my part.
[4573.28 → 4574.28] If I were a shepherd, I would do my part.
[4574.28 → 4588.28] If I were a shepherd, I would do my part.
[4588.28 → 4589.28] But I would do my part.
[4589.28 → 4592.28] Or I would give him, Lord Jesus,
[4592.28 → 4597.28] Or as we would offer you.
[4597.28 → 4603.24] And all this Christmas morning
[4603.24 → 4607.08] Express your gratitude
[4607.08 → 4614.48] Praise to you, O Jesus
[4614.48 → 4620.84] Praise to Christ, our King
[4620.84 → 4627.08] Glory in the highest
[4627.08 → 4633.26] Spirit will be saved
[4633.26 → 4647.86] You know, one of the things that Christmas tells us
[4647.86 → 4650.50] is that God is not aloof.
[4651.88 → 4653.52] He is not far off.
[4653.52 → 4657.30] He is not blind to our pain and the pain of this world.
[4658.42 → 4659.70] But he has seen it
[4659.70 → 4661.60] He has felt it
[4661.60 → 4663.70] And he has entered into it
[4663.70 → 4665.50] Ultimately to heal it
[4665.50 → 4667.78] And to heal the world and to make it right again.
[4668.54 → 4669.66] So one of the things we do
[4669.66 → 4671.36] as Christians when we worship God
[4671.36 → 4673.24] is we don't ignore the pain of the world
[4673.24 → 4676.10] but we bring it in here, we bring it into our hearts
[4676.10 → 4677.30] and we lift it up to God
[4677.30 → 4680.20] who tells us that he loves us
[4680.20 → 4681.96] that he loves the world
[4681.96 → 4684.64] that he will make all things new.
[4685.48 → 4687.04] So let's pray for this world
[4687.04 → 4688.32] this world that needs hope.
[4688.44 → 4689.50] Would you please join me in prayer?
[4690.16 → 4691.52] And after I pray
[4691.52 → 4693.28] I will say, Lord in your mercy
[4693.28 → 4694.88] and when you hear that
[4694.88 → 4695.86] please respond
[4695.86 → 4697.36] Hear our prayer
[4697.36 → 4704.38] Eternal God, we bow before the mystery of your incarnation
[4704.38 → 4708.68] We praise you that you entered into the darkness of our world
[4708.68 → 4710.16] to be our light
[4710.16 → 4712.72] to be God with us
[4712.72 → 4716.72] We lift to you all those who are in darkness
[4716.72 → 4719.98] So many people today in our world
[4719.98 → 4720.98] are weary
[4720.98 → 4723.84] exhausted, worried, burned out
[4723.84 → 4726.62] We pray for anyone
[4726.62 → 4728.34] who is bearing
[4728.34 → 4730.46] this morning, today
[4730.46 → 4732.24] here and everywhere
[4732.24 → 4733.74] Lord, the heaviness of the world
[4733.74 → 4735.58] The lonely
[4735.58 → 4737.50] the fearful
[4737.50 → 4739.50] the suffering
[4739.50 → 4740.62] and the grieving
[4740.62 → 4742.58] Father, we especially pray
[4742.58 → 4743.94] this morning for Robin
[4743.94 → 4745.68] who continues to
[4745.68 → 4747.10] feel deep sadness
[4747.10 → 4748.26] over the loss of her mother
[4748.26 → 4750.72] We pray for the sick
[4750.72 → 4752.84] and those who are tending them
[4752.84 → 4755.02] especially, Lord, for Pat
[4755.02 → 4756.28] Nancy
[4756.28 → 4757.30] Jordan
[4757.30 → 4758.50] and Grace
[4758.50 → 4761.16] Father, we pray in hope
[4761.16 → 4762.62] Lord, in your mercy
[4762.62 → 4764.32] hear our prayer
[4764.32 → 4767.20] God, we remember those facing
[4767.20 → 4768.90] eviction from their homes
[4768.90 → 4771.50] We remember the homeless
[4771.50 → 4773.08] the lost
[4773.08 → 4774.42] the displaced
[4774.42 → 4777.16] the hundreds of millions of refugees
[4777.16 → 4781.12] We thank you that you have shared these experiences
[4781.12 → 4783.42] in the life of your son
[4783.42 → 4786.20] who was laid in a manger
[4786.20 → 4788.86] who was a refugee in Egypt
[4788.86 → 4790.32] in the first years of his life
[4790.32 → 4792.40] and who in his ministry
[4792.40 → 4794.68] said he has nowhere to lay his head
[4794.68 → 4796.78] Lord, in your mercy
[4796.78 → 4798.48] hear our prayer
[4798.48 → 4800.72] Lord, our hearts are heavy
[4800.72 → 4802.06] with the suffering of this world
[4802.06 → 4803.90] We remember the many
[4803.90 → 4805.62] victims of political power
[4805.62 → 4806.18] and greed
[4806.18 → 4808.08] the many innocent
[4808.08 → 4808.90] who are killed
[4808.90 → 4809.50] by war
[4809.50 → 4810.28] or violence
[4810.28 → 4812.64] We remember
[4812.64 → 4813.24] the church
[4813.24 → 4813.90] persecuted
[4813.90 → 4815.64] our brothers and sisters
[4815.64 → 4816.36] in Christ
[4816.36 → 4817.54] who are tortured
[4817.54 → 4818.62] and even put to death
[4818.62 → 4820.60] We pray for all
[4820.60 → 4821.12] of those
[4821.12 → 4822.00] whose experience
[4822.00 → 4823.04] your son shared
[4823.04 → 4823.98] when he was born
[4823.98 → 4824.74] under the reign
[4824.74 → 4825.46] of King Herod
[4825.46 → 4827.08] and who was himself
[4827.08 → 4827.62] a victim
[4827.62 → 4829.20] and put to death
[4829.20 → 4830.26] by political violence
[4830.26 → 4832.04] Lord, in your mercy
[4832.04 → 4833.68] hear our prayer
[4833.68 → 4835.44] So we thank you, God
[4835.44 → 4837.18] for coming to light our darkness
[4837.18 → 4839.06] for opening a way
[4839.06 → 4840.14] to eternal life
[4840.14 → 4842.06] We thank you for the power
[4842.06 → 4843.04] that you gave us
[4843.04 → 4844.38] through your son Jesus Christ
[4844.38 → 4846.40] to become children of God
[4846.40 → 4849.54] children of the living Father
[4849.54 → 4852.36] And we thank you for the access
[4852.36 → 4853.52] that he has given us
[4853.52 → 4854.76] that we might pray
[4854.76 → 4856.62] along with him
[4856.62 → 4857.06] sharing
[4857.06 → 4858.62] in his prayer
[4858.62 → 4859.52] and saying together
[4859.52 → 4860.18] these words
[4860.18 → 4861.06] of the Lord's prayer
[4861.06 → 4862.54] Our Father
[4862.54 → 4863.66] who art in heaven
[4863.66 → 4865.88] hallowed be your name
[4865.88 → 4867.64] Thy kingdom come
[4867.64 → 4868.96] Thy will be done
[4868.96 → 4869.84] on earth
[4869.84 → 4870.84] as it is in heaven
[4870.84 → 4872.68] Give us this day
[4872.68 → 4873.70] our daily bread
[4873.70 → 4875.80] and forgive us our debts
[4875.80 → 4877.92] as we forgive our debtors
[4877.92 → 4879.34] and lead us not
[4879.34 → 4880.24] into temptation
[4880.24 → 4882.42] but deliver us from evil
[4882.42 → 4884.36] For thine is the kingdom
[4884.36 → 4885.74] and the power
[4885.74 → 4886.96] and the glory
[4886.96 → 4887.82] forever
[4887.82 → 4889.08] Amen
[4889.08 → 4890.70] Friends, please rise
[4890.70 → 4893.42] On this Christmas day
[4893.42 → 4894.18] receive
[4894.18 → 4896.44] this word of blessing
[4896.44 → 4897.32] I invite you to hold out
[4897.32 → 4897.96] your hands
[4897.96 → 4901.76] from Isaiah chapter 9
[4901.76 → 4904.90] For to us a child is born
[4904.90 → 4908.74] To us a son is given
[4908.74 → 4910.96] And the government will be
[4910.96 → 4912.14] on his shoulders
[4912.14 → 4913.86] And he will be called
[4913.86 → 4915.12] Wonderful Counsellor
[4915.12 → 4916.38] Mighty God
[4916.38 → 4917.82] Everlasting Father
[4917.82 → 4918.90] Prince of Peace
[4918.90 → 4921.00] Of the increase of his government
[4921.00 → 4921.56] and peace
[4921.56 → 4922.76] there will be no end
[4922.76 → 4924.78] He will reign on David's throne
[4924.78 → 4926.06] and over his kingdom
[4926.06 → 4928.40] establishing and upholding it
[4928.40 → 4929.70] with justice and righteousness
[4929.70 → 4932.18] from this time on
[4932.18 → 4933.34] and forever
[4933.34 → 4935.42] The zeal of the Lord Almighty
[4935.42 → 4937.04] will accomplish this
[4937.04 → 4937.84] Amen
