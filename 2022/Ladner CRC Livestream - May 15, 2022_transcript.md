[454.00 --> 455.00]  Good morning.
[455.00 --> 456.00]  Good morning.
[456.00 --> 459.00]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church this Sunday.
[459.00 --> 465.00]  It is truly a joyous occasion to gather together and worship the Lord Jesus Christ, who suffered,
[465.00 --> 470.00]  was crucified, and died on the cross for our sins, and then rose from the dead on the third
[470.00 --> 473.00]  day, victorious over death.
[473.00 --> 477.00]  Whether it's the first time or the thousandth time you've heard that, you have to admit,
[477.00 --> 479.00]  it's energizing.
[479.00 --> 485.00]  My name is Ryan, and I will help lead us this morning in worship, along with our former
[485.00 --> 488.00]  Pastor Ernst, who will be bringing us our message today.
[488.00 --> 492.00]  And if you haven't already noticed, I am dealing with a face issue this morning.
[492.00 --> 496.00]  It's a paralysis on the left side, so don't panic.
[496.00 --> 500.00]  I'm not having a stroke or anything, but I'll do my best to speak clearly.
[500.00 --> 503.00]  So, yeah, just bear with me.
[503.00 --> 508.00]  But now let's turn our attention to the purpose for what we gathered, and that is to worship
[508.00 --> 509.00]  our Lord.
[509.00 --> 514.00]  If you are able, I'd ask you to please stand as we turn our hearts and minds towards the
[514.00 --> 518.00]  worship of our perfect Father in heaven, who welcomes us with these words.
[518.00 --> 524.00]  Lord, this is the message we have heard from God and proclaim to you, that God is light,
[524.00 --> 527.00]  and in God there is no darkness at all.
[527.00 --> 532.00]  If we walk in the light as God is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[532.00 --> 536.00]  And the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
[536.00 --> 541.00]  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[541.00 --> 547.00]  for our sins to set us free from the present evil age, according to the will of our God
[547.00 --> 550.00]  and Father, to whom be the glory forever and ever.
[550.00 --> 551.00]  Amen.
[551.00 --> 556.00]  Now let us take this opportunity to greet each other and our few neighbours and just say
[556.00 --> 558.00]  good morning and pass the peace.
[558.00 --> 571.00]  Thank you.
[575.00 --> 580.00]  Here we go.
[580.00 --> 582.00]  A Ng�ic Ch pages
[582.00 --> 606.40]  Come all you people, come raise your maker.
[606.40 --> 611.20]  Come all you people, come raise your maker.
[611.20 --> 615.96]  Come all you people, come raise your maker.
[616.42 --> 619.56]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[620.66 --> 625.46]  Come all you people, come raise your maker.
[629.82 --> 634.22]  Come all you people, come raise your maker.
[634.22 --> 637.54]  Come now and worship the Lord.
[637.54 --> 643.38]  Come all you people, come raise the Spirit
[643.38 --> 648.00]  Come all you people, come raise the Spirit
[648.00 --> 652.66]  Come all you people, come raise the Spirit
[652.66 --> 656.42]  Come now and worship the Lord
[667.54 --> 678.52]  It will lift all the blood of God and King
[678.52 --> 683.48]  And bless your holy name
[683.48 --> 690.14]  Day after day we'll sing your praise
[690.14 --> 695.12]  Forever and forever
[695.12 --> 701.78]  One generation will come to the net
[701.78 --> 708.00]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[708.00 --> 713.78]  All of the world stands His marvelous land
[713.78 --> 721.98]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[721.98 --> 728.64]  Praise the Lord in all His ways
[728.64 --> 734.36]  He's greatly to be praised
[734.36 --> 739.64]  Worry to search for endless days
[739.64 --> 746.30]  His greatness none could fathom
[746.30 --> 752.02]  One generation will call to the net
[752.02 --> 758.08]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[758.08 --> 764.74]  All of the world stands His marvelous land
[764.74 --> 771.46]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[771.46 --> 779.74]  We want to play the splendor of the world
[779.74 --> 786.74]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[786.74 --> 788.40]  All of the world His hands has made
[788.40 --> 790.40]  Far here to steal the majesty
[790.40 --> 796.12]  We see in the creation
[796.12 --> 802.78]  One generation will come to the net
[802.78 --> 808.50]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[808.50 --> 810.16]  God of the world
[810.16 --> 814.28]  God of the world sings His marvelous land
[814.28 --> 823.16]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[823.16 --> 830.16]  Now may your name be sung in every tongue
[830.16 --> 833.82]  In every place
[833.82 --> 840.82]  Sing the faith of your great love
[840.82 --> 845.82]  In every generation
[845.82 --> 851.82]  One generation will call to the net
[851.82 --> 857.82]  Our God is good and His hand is strong
[857.82 --> 864.18]  All of the world sings His marvelous land
[864.18 --> 871.48]  And our voice will join with theirs in the song
[871.48 --> 897.62]  I saw the Lord
[897.62 --> 901.98]  And He answered me
[901.98 --> 905.98]  And delivered me
[905.98 --> 909.16]  From everything
[909.16 --> 913.98]  Those who call me
[913.98 --> 917.02]  Our radiant
[917.02 --> 921.62]  They'll never be ashamed
[921.62 --> 925.48]  They'll never be ashamed
[925.48 --> 929.84]  This poor man cry
[929.84 --> 933.84]  And the Lord heard me
[933.84 --> 936.64]  And saved me
[936.64 --> 941.28]  From my enemies
[941.28 --> 945.84]  The Son of God
[945.84 --> 949.84]  Surround His name
[949.84 --> 954.20]  He will deliver me
[954.20 --> 958.20]  He will deliver me
[958.20 --> 959.20]  He will deliver me
[959.20 --> 965.20]  Magnify the Lord with me
[965.20 --> 970.20]  Come and start His name
[970.20 --> 971.56]  Together
[971.56 --> 973.56]  Together
[973.56 --> 976.56]  Glorify the Lord
[976.56 --> 978.56]  Glorify the Lord
[978.56 --> 980.56]  With me
[980.56 --> 984.56]  Come and start His name
[984.56 --> 988.92]  Forever
[988.92 --> 990.92]  And see
[990.92 --> 994.92]  That the Lord is good
[994.92 --> 998.92]  Oh, blesses me
[998.92 --> 1002.92]  Who lives in Him
[1002.92 --> 1006.92]  Oh, fear the Lord
[1006.92 --> 1010.28]  All of all you saints
[1010.28 --> 1012.28]  You'll give me
[1012.28 --> 1015.28]  He'll give you everything
[1015.28 --> 1018.28]  You'll give you everything
[1018.28 --> 1018.96]  He'll give you everything
[1018.96 --> 1024.16]  Magnify the Lord
[1024.16 --> 1025.98]  With me
[1025.98 --> 1035.54]  Come and salt his name together
[1035.54 --> 1042.50]  Glorify the Lord with me
[1042.50 --> 1050.64]  Come and salt his name forever
[1050.64 --> 1058.46]  Let us bless the Lord
[1058.46 --> 1062.60]  Every day and night
[1062.60 --> 1066.30]  Never-ending praise
[1066.30 --> 1070.18]  May our incense rise
[1070.18 --> 1073.64]  Let us bless the Lord
[1073.64 --> 1077.68]  Every day and night
[1077.68 --> 1081.34]  Never-ending praise
[1081.34 --> 1085.18]  May our incense rise
[1085.18 --> 1088.50]  Let us bless the Lord
[1088.50 --> 1092.44]  Every day and night
[1092.44 --> 1096.30]  Never-ending praise
[1096.30 --> 1100.14]  May our incense rise
[1100.14 --> 1106.22]  Magnify the Lord with me
[1106.22 --> 1114.50]  Come and salt his name together
[1114.50 --> 1120.78]  Glorify the Lord with me
[1120.78 --> 1129.12]  Come and salt his name forever
[1129.12 --> 1135.40]  Glorify the Lord with me
[1135.40 --> 1143.68]  Come and salt his name together
[1143.68 --> 1150.40]  Glorify the Lord with me
[1150.40 --> 1158.68]  Come and salt his name forever
[1158.68 --> 1176.34]  At this point the kids can head off to kids life
[1176.34 --> 1179.20]  So please be blessed as you go along with your teachers
[1179.20 --> 1181.84]  May you be filled up with all good things
[1181.84 --> 1197.74]  At this point I'd like to ask you guys to join me
[1197.74 --> 1199.94]  In a response of reading of Psalm 90
[1199.94 --> 1201.56]  For our confession and assurance
[1201.56 --> 1204.06]  As usual there will be two arrows to indicate
[1204.06 --> 1205.62]  The congregations part
[1205.62 --> 1206.96]  And I'll read the part with one arrow
[1206.96 --> 1210.88]  You have set our iniquities before you
[1210.88 --> 1214.00]  Our secret sins in the light of your presence
[1214.00 --> 1217.86]  All our days pass under your wrath
[1217.86 --> 1220.18]  We finish our years with a moan
[1220.18 --> 1223.06]  Our days may come to seventy years
[1223.06 --> 1224.96]  Or eighty if our strength endures
[1224.96 --> 1228.08]  Yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow
[1228.08 --> 1231.24]  For they quickly pass and we fly away
[1231.24 --> 1235.76]  If only we knew the power of your anger
[1235.76 --> 1238.98]  Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due
[1238.98 --> 1241.14]  Teach us to number our days
[1241.14 --> 1243.50]  That we may gain a heart of wisdom
[1243.50 --> 1246.70]  Relent Lord
[1246.70 --> 1248.76]  How long can it be
[1248.76 --> 1251.50]  Have compassion on your servants
[1251.50 --> 1254.30]  Satisfy us in mourning
[1254.30 --> 1256.32]  With your unfailing love
[1256.32 --> 1258.86]  That we may be sing joy
[1258.86 --> 1261.48]  And be glad in all our days
[1261.48 --> 1271.90]  For as many years as we have seen trouble
[1271.90 --> 1275.40]  May your deeds be shown to your servants
[1275.40 --> 1277.90]  Your splendor to their children
[1277.90 --> 1281.68]  May the beauty of the Lord our God rest on us
[1281.68 --> 1284.30]  And establish the work of our hands for us
[1284.30 --> 1287.52]  Yes, establish the work of our hands
[1287.52 --> 1288.68]  Let us pray
[1288.68 --> 1291.58]  Heavenly Father
[1291.58 --> 1294.50]  We are often more than happy to let
[1294.50 --> 1296.62]  The sinfulness of the world flourish
[1296.62 --> 1298.84]  Like weeds in an untended garden
[1298.84 --> 1303.16]  Our sins of omission are all too easy to excuse
[1303.16 --> 1305.00]  We ask you Lord
[1305.00 --> 1307.58]  Challenge our indifference and our apathy
[1307.58 --> 1310.44]  May the light of Christ be reflected
[1310.44 --> 1312.22]  In the work of our hands
[1312.22 --> 1314.06]  In Jesus' powerful name
[1314.06 --> 1315.08]  Amen
[1315.08 --> 1317.80]  People of God
[1317.80 --> 1320.84]  What exactly is the work of our hands?
[1321.06 --> 1321.82]  What are they to do?
[1322.48 --> 1323.60]  Well fortunately for us
[1323.60 --> 1324.82]  We have the answer
[1324.82 --> 1325.98]  Straight from Jesus
[1325.98 --> 1329.88]  Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee
[1329.88 --> 1331.40]  To the mountain where Jesus
[1331.40 --> 1333.86]  The mountain where Jesus had told them to go
[1333.86 --> 1335.18]  When they saw him
[1335.18 --> 1336.26]  They worshipped him
[1336.26 --> 1338.18]  But some doubted
[1338.18 --> 1340.38]  Then Jesus came to them and said
[1340.38 --> 1342.92]  All authority in heaven and on earth
[1342.92 --> 1343.98]  Has been given to me
[1343.98 --> 1347.10]  Therefore go and make disciples of all nations
[1347.10 --> 1349.52]  Baptizing them in the name of the Father
[1349.52 --> 1350.62]  And of the Son
[1350.62 --> 1352.02]  And of the Holy Spirit
[1352.02 --> 1353.96]  Teaching them to obey everything
[1353.96 --> 1355.28]  I have commanded you
[1355.28 --> 1357.82]  And surely I am with you always
[1357.82 --> 1360.02]  To the very end of the age
[1360.02 --> 1362.22]  Let us sing now
[1362.22 --> 1364.72]  Of this glorious assurance
[1364.72 --> 1374.60]  I am forgiven
[1374.60 --> 1378.50]  Because you are forsaken
[1378.50 --> 1382.22]  I am accepted
[1382.22 --> 1386.40]  You will work on them
[1386.40 --> 1390.58]  I am alive and well
[1390.58 --> 1393.58]  Your spirit is within me
[1393.58 --> 1399.32]  Because you died and rose again
[1399.32 --> 1404.42]  I am forgiven
[1404.42 --> 1408.32]  Because you were forsaken
[1408.32 --> 1412.06]  I am accepted
[1412.06 --> 1414.06]  You are forsaken
[1414.06 --> 1415.06]  You are forsaken
[1415.06 --> 1416.06]  You are forsaken
[1416.06 --> 1417.06]  You are forsaken
[1417.06 --> 1418.06]  You are forsaken
[1418.06 --> 1420.44]  I am alive and well
[1420.44 --> 1423.06]  Your spirit is within me
[1423.06 --> 1425.06]  Because you are forsaken
[1425.06 --> 1430.06]  Because you died and rose again
[1430.06 --> 1434.94]  Amazing love
[1434.94 --> 1438.06]  How can it be
[1438.06 --> 1441.48]  That you my King
[1441.48 --> 1444.06]  Will die for me
[1444.06 --> 1448.94]  Amazing love
[1448.94 --> 1453.94]  How can it be
[1453.94 --> 1454.94]  That you my King
[1454.94 --> 1458.82]  Would die for me
[1458.82 --> 1460.94]  Amazing love
[1460.94 --> 1464.94]  How can it be
[1464.94 --> 1465.94]  That you my King
[1465.94 --> 1467.94]  Would die for me
[1467.94 --> 1470.94]  Amazing love
[1470.94 --> 1471.94]  How can it be
[1471.94 --> 1476.94]  Amazing love
[1476.94 --> 1477.94]  Amazing love
[1477.94 --> 1480.94]  I know it's true
[1480.94 --> 1486.94]  It's my joy to honor you
[1486.94 --> 1489.94]  In all I do
[1489.94 --> 1493.94]  I honor you
[1493.94 --> 1496.94]  You are my King
[1496.94 --> 1497.94]  You are my King
[1497.94 --> 1500.94]  You are my King
[1500.94 --> 1511.94]  You are my King
[1515.94 --> 1518.94]  Jesus you are my King
[1518.94 --> 1524.40]  You are my King.
[1526.34 --> 1533.00]  Amazing love, how can we
[1533.00 --> 1538.80]  that you are my King and I will die for me?
[1541.10 --> 1546.66]  Amazing love, I know it's true.
[1546.66 --> 1552.36]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1555.06 --> 1560.36]  Amazing love, how can we
[1560.36 --> 1566.20]  that you are my King and I will die for me?
[1568.80 --> 1574.36]  Amazing love, I know it's true.
[1574.36 --> 1580.06]  It's my joy to honor you
[1580.06 --> 1584.06]  in all I do.
[1584.06 --> 1587.06]  I honor you
[1587.06 --> 1590.76]  in all I do.
[1590.76 --> 1594.76]  I honor you.
[1594.76 --> 1604.46]  I honor you.
[1604.46 --> 1606.46]  I honor you.
[1606.46 --> 1608.16]  I honor you.
[1608.16 --> 1611.56]  My spiritual readings this morning come from the book of Acts, followed by the Gospel of John.
[1611.56 --> 1624.52]  In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up into heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
[1624.52 --> 1630.82]  After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave them many convincing proofs that he was alive.
[1630.82 --> 1636.52]  He appeared to them over the period of forty days and spoke to them about the kingdom of God.
[1636.52 --> 1638.52]  And now from John 20.
[1638.52 --> 1646.22]  Now Thomas, also known as Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
[1646.22 --> 1648.22]  See, the other disciples told him,
[1648.22 --> 1650.22]  We have seen the Lord.
[1650.22 --> 1652.22]  But he said to them,
[1652.22 --> 1660.22]  Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
[1660.22 --> 1665.22]  A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.
[1665.22 --> 1672.22]  Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, Peace be with you.
[1672.22 --> 1680.22]  Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here, see my hands, reach out your hand and put it into my side.
[1680.22 --> 1683.22]  Stop doubting and believe.
[1683.22 --> 1688.22]  Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God.
[1688.22 --> 1692.22]  Then Jesus told him, Because you have seen me, you have believed.
[1692.22 --> 1698.22]  Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.
[1698.22 --> 1704.22]  Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
[1704.22 --> 1714.22]  But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
[1714.22 --> 1717.22]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1717.22 --> 1719.22]  Thanks be to God.
[1719.22 --> 1724.22]  At this point I would like to invite up Brother Ernest to bring us God's word.
[1724.22 --> 1729.22]  Good morning.
[1729.22 --> 1745.22]  It's good to be back again, but when I read the, on the first page it says, Guest Pastor Ernest de Vries, my wife and I, Winnie, who is here, we were sitting for 34 years in a third pew.
[1745.22 --> 1747.22]  Not in the second or the fourth, but in the third pew.
[1747.22 --> 1750.22]  We raised five children there.
[1750.22 --> 1752.22]  And now Winnie sits in the back.
[1752.22 --> 1753.22]  I don't know.
[1757.22 --> 1758.22]  Anyways.
[1758.22 --> 1770.22]  Dear congregation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1770.22 --> 1785.22]  We have just read, or Ryan just read, that Jesus appeared to his disciples and many others for over a period of 40 years between his resurrection and, as you already heard this morning, the ascension.
[1785.22 --> 1791.22]  This is next week on the 26th, always on a Thursday, the 26th of May.
[1791.22 --> 1795.22]  A significant period of 40 days.
[1796.22 --> 1802.22]  Did you know that the number 40 appears 146 times in the scripture?
[1802.22 --> 1804.22]  Mostly in the Old Testament.
[1804.22 --> 1809.22]  And it's a number that signifies the great acts of God.
[1809.22 --> 1811.22]  That is one reason.
[1811.22 --> 1815.22]  And the other is about testing and trial in the Bible.
[1815.22 --> 1825.22]  Remember the flood, 40 days and 40 nights, rain, the ark and Noah.
[1825.22 --> 1837.22]  When Moses sent the spies to Cana, to the new land, the land of milk and honey, they had to explore that land, Canaan, for 40 days.
[1837.22 --> 1847.22]  When Goliath challenged the Israelites, he did it twice a day for 40 days before David defeated him.
[1847.22 --> 1858.22]  And Moses went three times climbing Mount Sinai, three times for 40 days to receive, of course, the Ten Commandments.
[1858.22 --> 1868.22]  I understand that Pastor Jason has been, he was in the Middle East and they also climbed Mount Sinai for one night.
[1868.22 --> 1870.22]  And I've read, I read his blog.
[1870.22 --> 1872.22]  It was bitterly, bitterly cold.
[1872.22 --> 1876.22]  So you can imagine Moses three times 40 days.
[1876.22 --> 1877.22]  That's a long time.
[1877.22 --> 1881.22]  Jonah and Nineveh.
[1881.22 --> 1889.22]  Jonah warned Nineveh that 40 more days, and if you don't repent, your city shall be overthrown.
[1889.22 --> 1894.22]  Israel spent 40 days, 40 years in the desert.
[1894.22 --> 1903.22]  And before Jesus was tempted by Satan, he spent 40 days and nights in the Judean desert.
[1903.22 --> 1915.22]  And now we are, this morning, we are in this very important 40 day period from the resurrection of our Lord till his ascension into heaven.
[1915.22 --> 1923.22]  So what then is the significance of this particular 40 day period?
[1923.22 --> 1928.22]  Well, the answer comes straight from the scriptures and Ryan just read it.
[1928.22 --> 1936.22]  That Jesus himself gave many convincing proof that he was alive.
[1936.22 --> 1938.22]  He didn't just appear once.
[1938.22 --> 1940.22]  He didn't just appear to his disciples.
[1940.22 --> 1944.22]  Over the 40 days course, he appeared to many, many days.
[1944.22 --> 1954.22]  Proving again and again from the scriptures that he, the Christ, must suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.
[1954.22 --> 1957.22]  This is from Luke chapter 24.
[1957.22 --> 1962.22]  The Apostle Paul, later on, wrote in 1 Corinthians 15.
[1962.22 --> 1968.22]  He wrote, and this letter was written, they think, about 55 years later.
[1968.22 --> 1980.22]  And in this letter, he stresses that many of the witnesses were still alive and could verify the resurrection of our Lord.
[1980.22 --> 1990.22]  Now, right from the beginning, after Jesus had risen from the dead and through the epistles, and then of course the whole history of the church,
[1990.22 --> 1999.22]  this resurrection of Jesus has been disputed and denied outside of the church, but also within the church.
[1999.22 --> 2006.22]  During the early 90s, that's a long time ago, I used to listen to a very popular program.
[2006.22 --> 2012.22]  It was on TV, on CBC, where two theologians would debate each other.
[2012.22 --> 2016.22]  The one was a conservative and the other one was more progressive liberal.
[2016.22 --> 2023.22]  And the liberal one was, if I may use the term, was Tom Harper, P-U-R.
[2023.22 --> 2026.22]  Tom Harper was a brilliant Anglican theologian.
[2026.22 --> 2030.22]  He taught the Greek, New Testament Greek for many years.
[2030.22 --> 2035.22]  He was for many years the religious editor of the Toronto Star.
[2035.22 --> 2038.22]  And he wrote several books.
[2038.22 --> 2040.22]  His most famous book was The Pagan Christ.
[2040.22 --> 2041.22]  I've never read it.
[2041.22 --> 2044.22]  I always loved listening to him.
[2044.22 --> 2052.22]  In a later interview, we were visiting my aunt on the Sunshine Coast, and she was a member of the United Church there,
[2052.22 --> 2058.22]  and there was the church magazine, and there was an interview with Tom Harper, much later age.
[2058.22 --> 2061.22]  And in it he said this,
[2061.22 --> 2063.22]  I love reading the Bible every day.
[2063.22 --> 2067.22]  In fact, he read his Bible from the New Testament Greek.
[2067.22 --> 2070.22]  You and I read it in English, he would read it in Greek.
[2070.22 --> 2074.22]  Very smart, intelligent man.
[2074.22 --> 2079.22]  But I've come to the conclusion, he said, that Jesus never existed.
[2079.22 --> 2084.22]  He says he's a fictional or mythological figure.
[2084.22 --> 2089.22]  And so according, we have to believe, according to Tom Harper,
[2089.22 --> 2093.22]  Jesus never rose then also from the dead.
[2093.22 --> 2107.22]  And yet this morning we read the words of Luke, who wrote the book of Acts, that Jesus gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.
[2107.22 --> 2114.22]  Also again, later on, the Apostle Paul, from the same letter, 1 Corinthians, and this is very important.
[2114.22 --> 2121.22]  And I'd like to read this to you, 1 Corinthians 15, where he speaks about the resurrection of the dead.
[2121.22 --> 2125.22]  And this is Paul.
[2125.22 --> 2137.22]  But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[2137.22 --> 2143.22]  If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
[2143.22 --> 2152.22]  And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless, and so is your faith.
[2152.22 --> 2157.22]  More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God.
[2157.22 --> 2162.22]  For we have testified about God, that he raised Christ from the dead.
[2162.22 --> 2167.22]  But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
[2167.22 --> 2173.22]  For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
[2173.22 --> 2182.22]  And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins.
[2182.22 --> 2187.22]  Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
[2187.22 --> 2196.22]  If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
[2196.22 --> 2203.22]  And so this morning with Paul, we have to conclude then that the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2203.22 --> 2208.22]  this 40-day period, are the foundation of our faith.
[2208.22 --> 2212.22]  It is the heart of the Christian message.
[2212.22 --> 2215.22]  It is central to the gospel, the good news.
[2215.22 --> 2222.22]  And this is all reflected in our creeds, in our confessions, our theology, our doctrine, whatever you want to call it.
[2222.22 --> 2227.22]  This is where Christianity stands or falls compared with anything else.
[2227.22 --> 2230.22]  So that's part one.
[2230.22 --> 2233.22]  Now we come to part two.
[2233.22 --> 2242.22]  What about the people who first experienced those 40 days between the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord?
[2242.22 --> 2249.22]  Well, when you read in the gospels, especially Luke and John, we read words like fear.
[2249.22 --> 2252.22]  There is fear amongst the followers of Jesus.
[2252.22 --> 2253.22]  There is confusion.
[2253.22 --> 2258.22]  There is great disappointment and doubt.
[2258.22 --> 2267.22]  But when we go on, there is also forgiveness, great amazement and praising God and great joy.
[2267.22 --> 2274.22]  And so one of the persons we meet here this morning, we read it in the text, is of course, Thomas.
[2274.22 --> 2281.22]  And I'm sure that over the centuries, much has been written about him and many, many sermons have been preached about him,
[2281.22 --> 2285.22]  concerning him and his doubt about the risen Lord.
[2285.22 --> 2295.22]  I think, I have to be careful here, I think Thomas has been kind of given a bad rap here in terms of doubting.
[2295.22 --> 2300.22]  For 2000 years now, he is still the doubting Thomas.
[2300.22 --> 2301.22]  Think of that.
[2301.22 --> 2306.22]  Because we all, all the other disciples, they doubted, and we sometimes doubt.
[2306.22 --> 2311.22]  But we have doubting Thomas in the scriptures now for more than 2000 years.
[2311.22 --> 2319.22]  Did you know that Thomas' name, Thomas called Didymus, his real name was Judas?
[2319.22 --> 2324.22]  And there were three disciples with the name Judas.
[2324.22 --> 2333.22]  And so some people think that they gave him or Jesus gave him the name Thomas, because that is in the Hebrew, it means twin.
[2333.22 --> 2337.22]  And called Didymus is in the Greek called twin.
[2337.22 --> 2341.22]  So that's where we have the name Thomas.
[2341.22 --> 2347.22]  And the reason why there were so many Judas is because they were all named at that time,
[2347.22 --> 2354.22]  now not a popular name of course Judas, but at that time was the most popular name after Judas Maccabee,
[2354.22 --> 2359.22]  the freedom fighter, who at one point for a while delivered Israel from the enemy.
[2359.22 --> 2363.22]  And so there were lots of Judas's during the time of Jesus.
[2363.22 --> 2366.22]  Now for his character.
[2366.22 --> 2372.22]  We really don't know that much about Thomas called Didymus.
[2372.22 --> 2380.22]  But some writers have called him, and this morning we were in our discussion group, and it was already kind of mentioned.
[2380.22 --> 2385.22]  Some writers call him a 21st century man.
[2385.22 --> 2386.22]  Skeptical.
[2386.22 --> 2388.22]  He wants to know things.
[2388.22 --> 2394.22]  A man who demands proof all the time, and he wants answers.
[2394.22 --> 2399.22]  For example, and this is again from the Gospel of John.
[2399.22 --> 2406.22]  When Jesus comforts his disciples about his imminent departure, ultimately going to be with the Father.
[2406.22 --> 2412.22]  In John 14 he says, you know the way to the place I am going.
[2412.22 --> 2419.22]  To which it is Thomas who answers, Lord, we don't know where you are going.
[2419.22 --> 2422.22]  So how can we know the way?
[2422.22 --> 2424.22]  It's quite a question.
[2424.22 --> 2428.22]  Even in a tense moment like this, Thomas is looking for an explanation.
[2428.22 --> 2431.22]  That's Thomas the disciple.
[2431.22 --> 2444.22]  The Bible scholar, some of you know that name, Herman Bavinck, he lived a long time ago, called him the born and chronic pessimist.
[2444.22 --> 2448.22]  So here you have a critical mind and a pessimistic mind.
[2448.22 --> 2450.22]  What a combination.
[2450.22 --> 2464.22]  And he, in his writing, he refers to John 11, where the story recorded of the raising of Lazarus, which takes place near Jerusalem.
[2464.22 --> 2471.22]  It's a dangerous place to be because his disciples are saying, when you go there, we know they want to kill you.
[2471.22 --> 2473.22]  That's how it was.
[2473.22 --> 2477.22]  And here comes only Thomas' response.
[2477.22 --> 2482.22]  Let us all go, that we may die with him.
[2482.22 --> 2485.22]  Now, you can interpret this in both ways.
[2485.22 --> 2491.22]  Either he is a hero like Peter, you know, we go, I want to go with you and I'm going to die with you.
[2491.22 --> 2494.22]  Or this is Thomas the pessimist.
[2494.22 --> 2496.22]  Let's go.
[2496.22 --> 2498.22]  Everything is lost anyways.
[2498.22 --> 2501.22]  The whole mission is a lost cause.
[2501.22 --> 2506.22]  Quite often we forget to understand that these disciples,
[2506.22 --> 2518.22]  they held a very strong hope that Jesus would be the deliverer, the Messiah, who would deliver Israel from the Romans.
[2518.22 --> 2523.22]  With all the other nations about 400 years of occupation and in between John Maccabee.
[2523.22 --> 2525.22]  That's a long time.
[2525.22 --> 2529.22]  This month in Europe they have celebrated the delivery of Nazi Germany.
[2529.22 --> 2531.22]  That was only four or five years.
[2531.22 --> 2533.22]  And what a celebration that was.
[2533.22 --> 2537.22]  This is hundreds of years of occupation.
[2537.22 --> 2539.22]  So this was very strong.
[2539.22 --> 2547.22]  They even say that Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Jesus, was so disappointed because of this belief.
[2547.22 --> 2555.22]  And even John the Baptist, remember, he sends his disciples to Jesus and he's asking the question, or asked Jesus the question,
[2555.22 --> 2561.22]  are you the one or do we have to look for someone else?
[2561.22 --> 2567.22]  During those 40 days, there's also these two men going to Emmaus.
[2567.22 --> 2569.22]  And you know the story probably.
[2569.22 --> 2570.22]  Jesus joins him.
[2570.22 --> 2571.22]  They don't know him.
[2571.22 --> 2573.22]  They say, don't you know what happened in Israel?
[2573.22 --> 2575.22]  And Jesus says, not really.
[2575.22 --> 2587.22]  And then they say, and they stop and they have their face downcast and they say, we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.
[2587.22 --> 2593.22]  Even moments before his death, and we heard it this morning already, people doubted.
[2593.22 --> 2603.22]  And there was still the question, Lord, are you now, is it now this time, are you now this time going to restore the kingdom of Israel?
[2603.22 --> 2607.22]  So there was a very strong, understandable belief.
[2607.22 --> 2617.22]  Now going back to the text, or to Thomas, and the text that earns him the name Doubting Thomas.
[2617.22 --> 2622.22]  Where is he after Jesus' resurrection?
[2622.22 --> 2632.22]  It's been said, and I can say this here because last month I was here, and we had two funerals and a memorial in this church,
[2632.22 --> 2635.22]  of loved ones who passed away.
[2635.22 --> 2644.22]  And when a loved one passes away, there is so much pain, then quite often people do either, they seek company all the time in their pain,
[2644.22 --> 2650.22]  or they are going, live a time of solitude away from people.
[2650.22 --> 2655.22]  They have to be by themselves during this time of grief.
[2655.22 --> 2665.22]  So most likely, Thomas, very depressed and extremely disappointed in Jesus' crucifixion and death.
[2665.22 --> 2669.22]  Thomas seeks solitude.
[2669.22 --> 2678.22]  But notice though, when you look again at the text, that though he is gone, the other disciples, they seek him out, and they tell him,
[2678.22 --> 2681.22]  we have seen the Lord.
[2681.22 --> 2687.22]  And in fact, if you go to the original text in the Greek, it says, they keep on telling him,
[2687.22 --> 2691.22]  Thomas, Thomas, he really has risen.
[2691.22 --> 2694.22]  The Lord has really risen from the dead.
[2694.22 --> 2703.22]  But Thomas, with this critical mind, as we know him, 21st century man, he says, unless I see,
[2703.22 --> 2710.22]  Thomas again demands to see and feel before he can believe, will believe.
[2710.22 --> 2713.22]  Thomas demands evidence.
[2713.22 --> 2716.22]  He's a critical thinker that he is.
[2716.22 --> 2723.22]  I want to put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side.
[2723.22 --> 2726.22]  Only then will I believe.
[2726.22 --> 2730.22]  Thomas needs absolute proof of the risen Lord.
[2730.22 --> 2736.22]  So then one week later, the disciples meet again, and once again, Jesus appears before them,
[2736.22 --> 2744.22]  and Jesus invites them, him, Thomas, to do exactly what he demanded as proof.
[2744.22 --> 2749.22]  So that he too could believe in the resurrected Lord.
[2749.22 --> 2756.22]  Now, when you read his text over and over again, you notice the love shining through this conversation.
[2756.22 --> 2761.22]  Jesus does not give Thomas a lecture, O ye of little faith.
[2761.22 --> 2762.22]  He doesn't tell him off.
[2762.22 --> 2766.22]  He doesn't condemn him for his hesitation.
[2766.22 --> 2770.22]  Rather, he provides his evidence, saying, Thomas, here I am.
[2770.22 --> 2772.22]  Check it out.
[2772.22 --> 2773.22]  Go ahead.
[2773.22 --> 2774.22]  Do what you want.
[2774.22 --> 2783.22]  But after you have done it, please stop unbelieving and believe that it is me, the resurrected one.
[2783.22 --> 2791.22]  Now, whether Thomas actually checked out the hands or put his hand in Jesus' side is not good.
[2791.22 --> 2795.22]  Jesus' side is not mentioned and really is not important at all.
[2795.22 --> 2800.22]  What is important is his confession.
[2800.22 --> 2804.22]  My Lord and my God.
[2804.22 --> 2807.22]  Thomas saw and believed.
[2807.22 --> 2813.22]  And they were all witnesses of the fact that Jesus had risen from the dead.
[2813.22 --> 2820.22]  But again, only Thomas' confession is being mentioned in the Gospels, in the Gospel of John.
[2820.22 --> 2822.22]  My Lord and my God.
[2822.22 --> 2834.22]  So now we find, this is still all between the resurrection and the ascension of the 40 days.
[2834.22 --> 2835.22]  That's why it's so important.
[2835.22 --> 2841.22]  We find him at the Sea of Galilee with the six other disciples.
[2841.22 --> 2844.22]  Now, this is a whole sermon in itself.
[2844.22 --> 2846.22]  Think of it, what they have gone through.
[2846.22 --> 2848.22]  Three years of miracles.
[2848.22 --> 2850.22]  One after another.
[2850.22 --> 2851.22]  Quieting the sea.
[2851.22 --> 2854.22]  All the, everything that Jesus did.
[2854.22 --> 2855.22]  Healing the sick.
[2855.22 --> 2856.22]  Raising the dead.
[2856.22 --> 2858.22]  He dying.
[2858.22 --> 2860.22]  Raising again to life.
[2860.22 --> 2863.22]  And here we find these seven disciples.
[2863.22 --> 2864.22]  The Sea of Galilee.
[2864.22 --> 2873.22]  And Peter says, and I thought about this text when we had the celebration here of Tim.
[2873.22 --> 2874.22]  I go fishing.
[2874.22 --> 2877.22]  Peter says, I go fishing.
[2877.22 --> 2879.22]  And the other one says, we'll go with you.
[2879.22 --> 2880.22]  Think of it.
[2880.22 --> 2882.22]  It's almost like it was just a dream.
[2882.22 --> 2883.22]  It was an experience.
[2883.22 --> 2886.22]  Here we go back where we came from.
[2886.22 --> 2889.22]  Commercial fishermen.
[2889.22 --> 2891.22]  While Jesus, when he called them, he called them out.
[2891.22 --> 2893.22]  Make you fishers of man.
[2893.22 --> 2896.22]  They're back to the thing that they best.
[2896.22 --> 2901.22]  And then of course, the story goes on with the man standing on the seashore.
[2901.22 --> 2903.22]  And that is Jesus.
[2903.22 --> 2910.22]  And then we have this wonderful other confession of Peter three times saying, yes, Lord, you know all things.
[2910.22 --> 2911.22]  I love you.
[2911.22 --> 2916.22]  And Thomas was there during that confession as well.
[2916.22 --> 2926.22]  And then we find Thomas again with the disciples when Jesus is going to heaven.
[2926.22 --> 2929.22]  And yes, some still doubted.
[2929.22 --> 2933.22]  It doesn't say whether Thomas was one of the doubters.
[2933.22 --> 2934.22]  I doubted.
[2934.22 --> 2936.22]  I'm sure Thomas was a real believer there.
[2936.22 --> 2941.22]  But then it also says, yet they worshipped him.
[2941.22 --> 2947.22]  And then after this, Thomas along with the others, returns to Jerusalem.
[2947.22 --> 2951.22]  And it says, with great joy, praising God.
[2951.22 --> 2952.22]  What a change.
[2952.22 --> 2960.22]  Yes, Thomas is there when the Holy Spirit is also poured out, ten days later, on the day of Pentecost.
[2960.22 --> 2964.22]  What a life-changing story this is, people of God.
[2964.22 --> 2966.22]  From doubt to praise.
[2966.22 --> 2973.22]  From the hope of redeeming one nation of Israel to the hope of redeeming all nations.
[2973.22 --> 2974.22]  What a glorious gospel this is.
[2974.22 --> 2976.22]  What a glorious gospel this is.
[2976.22 --> 2986.22]  The Christian church turning the world upside down for the gospel of Jesus Christ, the resurrected Lord.
[2986.22 --> 2991.22]  And then Pentecost.
[2991.22 --> 2993.22]  The Holy Spirit has been poured out.
[2993.22 --> 2997.22]  The church starts to move on to the ends of the earth.
[2997.22 --> 3000.22]  Thomas has never been mentioned again.
[3000.22 --> 3004.22]  It's not important, I guess, according to the Lord.
[3004.22 --> 3005.22]  It's now Paul.
[3005.22 --> 3006.22]  It's now Peter.
[3006.22 --> 3007.22]  It's John.
[3007.22 --> 3008.22]  It's James.
[3008.22 --> 3009.22]  It's Timothy.
[3009.22 --> 3013.22]  Where did the Apostle Thomas land up?
[3013.22 --> 3015.22]  You may notice already.
[3015.22 --> 3027.22]  And if not, apparently the most reliable writings are that he also, just like the other ones, died a violent death.
[3027.22 --> 3030.22]  He went apparently east.
[3030.22 --> 3032.22]  Paul went west.
[3032.22 --> 3036.22]  Thomas went east, mostly to India.
[3036.22 --> 3054.22]  And when the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, arrived in India at around 1500 AD, they found a church that identified itself as the Christians of St. Thomas.
[3054.22 --> 3057.22]  There was a church in India.
[3057.22 --> 3068.22]  And a sixth century book tells that a traveler in India found a church in Malabar, as well as a bishop in Galiana, south of Bombay.
[3068.22 --> 3077.22]  A major church body in India has for centuries been called or carried the name the Mar Thoma Church.
[3077.22 --> 3088.22]  And over the years when I was a seafarers chaplain, I met many, many Christians from India, also connected to this name, Thomas.
[3088.22 --> 3092.22]  And so we thank God for this 40 day period.
[3092.22 --> 3095.22]  We thank God for this man called Thomas.
[3095.22 --> 3105.22]  Thomas, the believer in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is our only hope, our only hope to glory.
[3105.22 --> 3108.22]  Let us pray.
[3108.22 --> 3110.22]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gospel.
[3110.22 --> 3117.22]  We thank you for the good news that we may be here together, worship you already as people from all nations.
[3117.22 --> 3120.22]  What a wonderful sight that is this morning.
[3120.22 --> 3127.22]  And so, Lord, we pray that you will continue to bless your church also here in Ladner.
[3127.22 --> 3140.22]  That you will go with us, that you will protect us against the thoughts that you never rose from the dead, but that he is our only hope.
[3140.22 --> 3149.22]  And so, Lord, with that confidence and with that joy, may we continue to worship you here this morning and in the days and weeks and months ahead.
[3149.22 --> 3156.22]  Till, as it says, that you have promised you will come again in glory with all your angels.
[3156.22 --> 3158.22]  And what a day that will be.
[3158.22 --> 3163.22]  We ask it all in the holy and blessed name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
[3163.22 --> 3164.22]  Amen.
[3164.22 --> 3165.22]  Amen.
[3165.22 --> 3166.22]  Amen.
[3166.22 --> 3167.22]  Amen.
[3167.22 --> 3172.22]  Amen.
[3172.22 --> 3174.22]  Amen.
[3174.22 --> 3180.22]  Amen.
[3180.22 --> 3193.46]  We will feast in the house of Zion.
[3193.46 --> 3198.46]  We will sing with our hearts restored.
[3199.46 --> 3201.72]  We have done great things.
[3201.84 --> 3204.62]  We will sing together.
[3204.62 --> 3210.82]  We will feast and wait no more.
[3213.62 --> 3218.66]  We will not be burned by the fire.
[3220.18 --> 3224.66]  He is the Lord our God.
[3225.06 --> 3229.62]  We are not consumed by the flood.
[3229.62 --> 3235.70]  A well-protected God.
[3237.78 --> 3243.78]  We will feast in the house of Zion.
[3244.30 --> 3248.62]  We will sing with our hearts restored.
[3248.62 --> 3252.00]  He has done great things.
[3252.12 --> 3254.98]  We will sing together.
[3255.70 --> 3260.62]  We will feast and wait no more.
[3260.62 --> 3269.70]  In the dark of night before the dawn.
[3270.52 --> 3274.78]  My soul be not afraid.
[3275.78 --> 3280.78]  For the promised morning will I go.
[3280.78 --> 3288.98]  O God of Jacob be my strength.
[3288.98 --> 3295.18]  We will feast in the house of Zion.
[3295.54 --> 3299.98]  We will sing with our hearts restored.
[3300.98 --> 3303.38]  He has done great things.
[3303.50 --> 3306.30]  We will sing together.
[3306.98 --> 3311.98]  We will feast and wait no more.
[3311.98 --> 3341.96]  We will sing together.
[3341.96 --> 3371.94]  We will feast and wait no more.
[3371.96 --> 3373.96]  We will sing together.
[3373.96 --> 3374.96]  We will sing together.
[3374.96 --> 3378.52]  At this point I would like to ask the deacons to come up and take the collection.
[3378.52 --> 3383.46]  This morning's offering is for the African Children's Choir.
[3383.54 --> 3385.96]  I am not sure if we have a slide to go up there.
[3385.96 --> 3390.58]  But the African Children's Choir promotes the beauty, dignity and unlimited ability of the
[3390.58 --> 3394.44]  African child around the world being a voice for the millions of suffering children
[3394.44 --> 3395.96]  who cannot speak for themselves.
[3395.96 --> 3401.46]  The program provides the children's well-being and quality education utilizing the transforming
[3401.46 --> 3402.96]  power of music.
[3402.96 --> 3404.96]  So please give us your will.
[3404.96 --> 3405.96]  Thank you.
[3405.96 --> 3406.96]  Thank you.
[3406.96 --> 3408.96]  Thank you.
[3408.96 --> 3412.96]  Thank you.
[3412.96 --> 3413.96]  Thank you.
[3413.98 --> 3417.56]  Thank you.
[3417.96 --> 3418.46]  Thank you.
[3418.96 --> 3438.96]  Thank you.
[3438.96 --> 3440.96]  Amen.
[3468.96 --> 3470.96]  Amen.
[3498.96 --> 3500.96]  Amen.
[3500.96 --> 3502.96]  Amen.
[3502.96 --> 3504.96]  Amen.
[3504.96 --> 3506.96]  Amen.
[3506.96 --> 3508.96]  Amen.
[3508.96 --> 3510.96]  Amen.
[3510.96 --> 3512.96]  Amen.
[3512.96 --> 3514.96]  Amen.
[3514.96 --> 3518.96]  Before we come to God in prayer, a brief update on Richie Hendrickson.
[3518.96 --> 3528.96]  Unfortunately, the doctors have discovered an additional infection, which has required Richie to be moved to a different part of the hospital and be attended by a family member for 24 hours a day.
[3528.96 --> 3530.96]  So, it's quite serious.
[3530.96 --> 3534.96]  So, please keep little Richie in your prayers.
[3534.96 --> 3536.96]  So, let us pray.
[3539.96 --> 3546.96]  Almighty God, we stand among your creation and we are struck by the wonder of your craftsmanship.
[3546.96 --> 3549.96]  The whole earth shakes at the thunder of your voice.
[3549.96 --> 3554.96]  The violence of the raging waters is made calm by your rebuke.
[3554.96 --> 3558.96]  Yet, even the young sparrows are held in your care.
[3558.96 --> 3564.96]  For you are a God that faithfully attends to the suffering of the very least.
[3564.96 --> 3567.96]  We come as a broken, wayward people.
[3567.96 --> 3573.96]  You come as a shepherd, a healer, a counselor full of love, mercy, and grace.
[3573.96 --> 3577.96]  An ever-present God who hears and delights in our prayers.
[3577.96 --> 3580.96]  So, we come before you this morning.
[3580.96 --> 3588.96]  Indeed, we are compelled to worship you, to praise you, to give you thanks from the very depths of our souls.
[3588.96 --> 3592.96]  We thank you for a safe and peaceful country to live in.
[3592.96 --> 3598.96]  We are blessed with stable governments that by all accounts work for the betterment and safety of our people.
[3598.96 --> 3601.96]  We worship you openly this morning.
[3601.96 --> 3606.96]  Never for a moment needing to worry about an artillery shell going off halfway through the service.
[3606.96 --> 3608.96]  These are luxuries, Lord.
[3608.96 --> 3610.96]  We, who are born here, often forget.
[3610.96 --> 3616.96]  But for many people in this congregation, our new immigrants and our elderly members,
[3616.96 --> 3620.96]  it is a luxury that can never be forgotten and never taken for granted.
[3620.96 --> 3623.96]  Thank you for this family of believers here this morning.
[3623.96 --> 3628.96]  Compassionate, thoughtful, energetic people that look to do good in the world.
[3628.96 --> 3633.96]  And more importantly, are proud to do so in your name and your name alone.
[3633.96 --> 3638.96]  We thank you for the new life in Avena and Richie.
[3638.96 --> 3641.96]  The new children and grandchildren to members of this congregation.
[3641.96 --> 3649.96]  We also lift up Marion and Asifuwe as they are expecting to add to their families and our church family in the next few months.
[3649.96 --> 3654.96]  Thank you for the beautiful and seemingly boundless wilderness that surrounds our city.
[3654.96 --> 3661.96]  Though it has rained a lot these past few weeks, we pray that that will help stave off wildfires this summer.
[3661.96 --> 3668.96]  And yet, Lord, we are also a burdened and weary people, weighed down by the sin and suffering of this world.
[3668.96 --> 3675.96]  We pray for Ukraine, Ethiopia, Yemen, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.
[3675.96 --> 3681.96]  Deliver the peoples of these countries from violence that seems to never end.
[3681.96 --> 3684.96]  We pray for our sick and our shut-in.
[3684.96 --> 3688.96]  For those suffering the endless battle against lifelong illnesses.
[3688.96 --> 3692.96]  For those struggling against daily pain and chronic health issues.
[3692.96 --> 3702.96]  For those suffering with mental illnesses, depression, loneliness, and for those among us facing the daily effects of old age.
[3702.96 --> 3704.96]  We pray.
[3704.96 --> 3724.96]  In particular, Lord, we lift up Pat, Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Mark, Jerry and Ann, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, and Henry.
[3724.96 --> 3731.96]  Lord, we especially pray for Jan, who has had surgery to remove skin cancer.
[3731.96 --> 3734.96]  And for Janet, who will be undergoing a procedure this week.
[3734.96 --> 3738.96]  We also ask you for healing for Richie.
[3738.96 --> 3740.96]  Just a few weeks old.
[3740.96 --> 3748.96]  And now we have learned of an additional infection which requires a family member to be present 24 hours a day.
[3748.96 --> 3750.96]  This is heavy news for us.
[3750.96 --> 3755.96]  And it is such a hard start to a new life and a new family.
[3755.96 --> 3761.96]  Be near to Cody and Tara and the rest of the Hendrickson family.
[3761.96 --> 3764.96]  Lord, this is a long list.
[3764.96 --> 3766.96]  And their suffering is great.
[3766.96 --> 3768.96]  And we feel utterly helpless.
[3768.96 --> 3774.96]  Indeed, we pray for a day when this list of suffering and afflicted members of our congregation is empty.
[3774.96 --> 3778.96]  We pray for a day for a new heaven and a new earth.
[3778.96 --> 3782.96]  And for a day where you will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[3782.96 --> 3787.96]  A day when there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain.
[3787.96 --> 3790.96]  We ask you, Lord Jesus, come quickly.
[3790.96 --> 3793.96]  Heal our broken world.
[3793.96 --> 3798.96]  Deliver us from the rains and the floods and the wars and the famines and the pandemics.
[3798.96 --> 3802.96]  Just as you did for the Israelites thousands of years ago.
[3802.96 --> 3804.96]  We pray for you.
[3804.96 --> 3808.96]  But if not, we still give you thanks.
[3808.96 --> 3810.96]  We still praise you.
[3810.96 --> 3815.96]  We still rejoice in your holy name, which is a name above all names.
[3815.96 --> 3821.96]  May your kingdom come and your will, not ours, be done.
[3821.96 --> 3824.96]  Only in Jesus' powerful name we pray.
[3824.96 --> 3825.96]  Amen.
[3827.96 --> 3831.96]  At this point, I'd like to invite Ernest back up to the pulpit to bring us our parting blessing.
[3831.96 --> 3832.96]  Will you all rise, please?
[3832.96 --> 3848.96]  The parting blessing, or what we call it, the doxology, comes from Jude.
[3848.96 --> 3853.96]  To him who is able to keep you from falling.
[3853.96 --> 3859.96]  And to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[3859.96 --> 3866.96]  To the only God and our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority.
[3866.96 --> 3872.96]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore.
[3872.96 --> 3875.96]  And let us all say, Amen.
[3875.96 --> 3882.96]  This place has travelled to one by the plain-ago that I ask for this day
[3882.96 --> 3885.96]  And always proclaim to the praise of God.
[3885.96 --> 3892.96]  This present, the face fell between the abundance and the Herren,
[3892.96 --> 3894.96]  with His ministry is theấc card from Eurovisionan.
[3894.96 --> 3900.16]  All blessings flow,
[3900.56 --> 3907.20]  Prince Him, all creatures here below.
[3907.20 --> 3915.34]  Prince Him, above the heavenly host,
[3915.60 --> 3924.00]  Prince Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[3924.00 --> 3929.12]  Prince Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[3954.00 --> 3960.30]  Prince Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[3960.30 --> 3962.58]  Prince Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[3962.58 --> 3967.72]  Prince Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[3967.72 --> 3968.72]  Amen.
[3997.72 --> 3999.72]  Amen.
[4027.72 --> 4028.72]  Amen.
