[320.24 --> 322.24]  Good morning.
[322.24 --> 323.24]  Welcome to worship.
[323.24 --> 331.24]  I'm Jason Truel and it is my privilege and pleasure to worship with you this morning and to lead us in worship this morning.
[331.24 --> 337.24]  In the scriptures, the Gospel of John begins with this story.
[337.24 --> 343.24]  John the Baptist is preaching and Jesus passes by and John says,
[343.24 --> 347.24]  Look, behold the Lamb of God.
[347.24 --> 349.24]  What?
[349.24 --> 355.24]  Then two of John's disciples go up to Jesus and turning around, Jesus says to them,
[355.24 --> 357.24]  What do you want?
[357.24 --> 359.24]  What do you want?
[359.24 --> 361.24]  What do you want?
[361.24 --> 367.24]  I suppose that through the ages Jesus has repeated this question and is repeating it this morning.
[367.24 --> 369.24]  What do you want?
[369.24 --> 371.24]  What do you want?
[371.24 --> 373.24]  He is ready to meet us.
[373.24 --> 377.24]  He invites us to come to him.
[377.24 --> 389.24]  And so if it is forgiveness, if it is hope, if it is mercy, if it is his presence in the midst of our trials, Jesus is ready.
[389.24 --> 391.24]  So what is it that you want?
[391.24 --> 393.24]  So what is it that you want?
[393.24 --> 401.24]  People of God, whatever it is that you think you need, we come here to find it in Jesus.
[401.24 --> 405.24]  This morning, he is ready to meet you.
[405.24 --> 413.24]  So please join me as we respond to the Lord's call from Psalm 34.
[413.24 --> 416.24]  And where has the single arrow, I will read.
[416.24 --> 419.24]  And where has the double arrow, I invite you to join along.
[419.24 --> 422.24]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[422.24 --> 425.24]  Let us exalt his name together.
[425.24 --> 430.24]  I sought the Lord and he answered me.
[430.24 --> 434.24]  He delivered me from all my fears.
[434.24 --> 441.24]  The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry.
[441.24 --> 450.24]  But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil to blot out their name from the earth.
[450.24 --> 454.24]  The righteous cry out and the Lord hears them.
[454.24 --> 458.24]  He delivers them from all their troubles.
[458.24 --> 466.24]  The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all.
[466.24 --> 468.24]  Please join me in prayer.
[470.24 --> 481.24]  Glory be to you, our great God, the Alpha and the Omega, our Creator, our Redeemer, the one who sustains us,
[481.24 --> 484.24]  the Lamb of God who has come into the world.
[484.24 --> 490.24]  Our Counselor that draws near to us in moments of darkness.
[490.24 --> 495.24]  You, Lord, are the highest delight of our hearts.
[495.24 --> 499.24]  Every joy we have ever known comes from you.
[499.24 --> 504.24]  Every sorrow can be brought to you as our suffering servant.
[504.24 --> 510.24]  You, Lord, hold power and tenderness, both humility and holiness together.
[510.24 --> 513.24]  And so we exalt you this morning.
[513.24 --> 521.24]  Just as the sun rose and dispelled the darkness, we lift you up as the light of the world.
[521.24 --> 526.24]  Your creation praises you and your people do as well.
[526.24 --> 530.24]  So, Lord, in this service, be exalted.
[530.24 --> 532.24]  Draw us to yourself.
[532.24 --> 540.24]  And then send us out, Lord, this coming week to be your worshipers who bear witness to the light that indeed has come.
[540.24 --> 543.24]  It is in the name of Jesus we pray.
[543.24 --> 544.24]  Amen.
[544.24 --> 549.24]  Now, brothers and sisters, I invite you to rise in body or in soul.
[549.24 --> 554.24]  Our God now greets us with these words from Jeremiah 17.
[554.24 --> 559.24]  Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him.
[559.24 --> 565.24]  They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream.
[565.24 --> 567.24]  It does not fear when heat comes.
[567.24 --> 569.24]  Its leaves are always green.
[569.24 --> 574.24]  So, friends, as the Lord has greeted us this morning, I invite you to turn to one another.
[574.24 --> 576.24]  Greet one another in the name of the Lord.
[576.24 --> 583.24]  Congratulations,IX.
[583.24 --> 590.24]  You can change your mind to the Lord.
[590.24 --> 605.24]  Let us see the words insere into the Lord for being a star list instead of washing.
[605.24 --> 622.40]  Come away from rush and hurry
[622.40 --> 626.82]  To the stillness of God's peace
[626.82 --> 631.32]  From our vain ambitions, worry
[631.32 --> 635.72]  Come to rise to find release
[635.72 --> 640.68]  Come away from noise and clamor
[640.68 --> 645.12]  Life's demands and friends in peace
[645.12 --> 649.84]  Come to join the people gathered
[649.84 --> 654.74]  Here to see and find God's grace
[654.74 --> 660.16]  In the pastures of God's goodness
[660.16 --> 664.56]  We lie down to rest our souls
[664.56 --> 669.12]  From the waters of God's mercy
[669.12 --> 673.60]  We drink deeply, are made whole
[673.60 --> 678.70]  At the table of God's presence
[678.70 --> 683.10]  All the saints are richly filled
[683.10 --> 687.50]  With the oil of God's anointing
[687.50 --> 693.50]  Into service we are led
[693.50 --> 698.50]  Come then, children, with your burdens
[698.50 --> 703.50]  Life's confusions, fears, and pain
[703.50 --> 708.06]  Leave them at the cross of Jesus
[708.06 --> 712.46]  Take instead his kingdom's way
[712.46 --> 717.58]  Bring your thirst for they will quench them
[717.58 --> 722.46]  He alone will satisfy
[722.46 --> 726.46]  All our longings find attainment
[726.46 --> 732.86]  When to self we gladly die
[732.86 --> 741.26]  Christ is the Lord, O my soul
[741.26 --> 742.14]  The Lord of God, I cry
[742.14 --> 742.20]  Thanks all roll of the Father
[742.20 --> 744.24]  Love a prayer, I cry
[744.24 --> 744.26]  And the Lord of God, I cry
[744.26 --> 745.26]  I'll die todas vedades
[745.26 --> 745.66]  Do that with your команд or day
[745.66 --> 746.38]  O my soul, I cry
[746.38 --> 746.54]  You pray, O my soul, your Lord of your spirit
[746.54 --> 765.38]  Praise the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[765.38 --> 776.38]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[776.54 --> 791.54]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning, it's time to sing your song again.
[791.54 --> 805.54]  Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me, let me be singing when the evening comes.
[806.54 --> 821.54]  Praise the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[821.54 --> 833.54]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[833.54 --> 842.54]  You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
[842.54 --> 854.54]  Your name is great and your heart is kind. For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[854.54 --> 861.54]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[861.54 --> 876.54]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship his holy name.
[876.54 --> 891.54]  Sing like never before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[891.54 --> 903.54]  And on that day when my strength is failing, the end draws near and my time has come.
[903.54 --> 910.54]  Still, my soul, I'll sing your praise unending.
[910.54 --> 912.54]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[912.54 --> 917.54]  Ten thousand years and then forever more.
[917.54 --> 926.64]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
[926.64 --> 931.88]  Worship His holy name
[931.88 --> 938.36]  Sing like never before, O my soul
[938.36 --> 943.44]  I'll worship Your holy name
[943.44 --> 949.48]  I'll worship Your holy name
[949.48 --> 955.78]  I'll worship Your holy name
[973.44 --> 983.48]  How great the chasm that lay between us
[983.48 --> 990.48]  How high the mountain I could not climb
[990.48 --> 997.18]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[997.18 --> 1004.48]  And spoke Your name into the night
[1005.04 --> 1010.48]  Through the darkness Your loving kindness
[1011.02 --> 1017.48]  Tore through the shadows of my soul
[1017.48 --> 1022.02]  The work is finished
[1022.02 --> 1025.24]  The end is written
[1025.24 --> 1032.36]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1032.36 --> 1042.02]  Who could imagine so great a mercy
[1042.02 --> 1048.56]  What heart could fathom such boundless grace
[1048.56 --> 1055.68]  The God of ages stepped down from glory
[1055.68 --> 1062.56]  To wear my sin and bear my shame
[1062.56 --> 1066.10]  The cross has spoken
[1066.10 --> 1069.30]  I am forgiven
[1069.30 --> 1076.10]  The King of kings calls me His own
[1076.10 --> 1079.56]  Beautiful Savior
[1079.56 --> 1082.92]  I'm Yours forever
[1082.92 --> 1089.56]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1089.56 --> 1094.10]  Hallelujah
[1094.10 --> 1097.60]  Praise the one who set me free
[1097.60 --> 1099.02]  Hallelujah
[1099.02 --> 1104.22]  Death has lost His spirit upon me
[1104.22 --> 1107.10]  You have broken every shame
[1107.10 --> 1110.96]  There's salvation in Your name
[1110.96 --> 1116.44]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1116.44 --> 1123.64]  Then came the morning
[1123.64 --> 1127.74]  That sealed the promise
[1127.74 --> 1130.60]  Your buried body
[1130.60 --> 1133.98]  Began to breathe
[1133.98 --> 1137.98]  Out of the silence
[1137.98 --> 1138.98]  The roaring lion
[1138.98 --> 1140.98]  The roaring lion
[1140.98 --> 1143.78]  Declared the grave
[1143.78 --> 1147.52]  Has no claim on me
[1147.52 --> 1151.02]  Then came the morning
[1151.02 --> 1155.14]  That sealed the promise
[1155.14 --> 1158.18]  Your buried body
[1158.18 --> 1161.14]  Began to breathe
[1161.14 --> 1164.68]  Out of the silence
[1164.68 --> 1165.24]  Out of the silence
[1165.24 --> 1168.14]  The roaring lion
[1168.14 --> 1170.68]  Declared the grave
[1170.68 --> 1174.80]  Has no claim on me
[1174.80 --> 1180.90]  Jesus, yours is the victory
[1180.90 --> 1184.34]  Hallelujah
[1184.34 --> 1189.80]  Praise the one who set me free
[1189.80 --> 1191.14]  Hallelujah
[1191.14 --> 1193.34]  Hallelujah
[1193.34 --> 1196.54]  Death has lost its grip on me
[1196.54 --> 1200.00]  You have broken every chain
[1200.00 --> 1203.34]  There's salvation in Your name
[1203.34 --> 1208.96]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1208.96 --> 1211.34]  Hallelujah
[1211.34 --> 1216.86]  Praise the one who set me free
[1216.86 --> 1218.20]  Hallelujah
[1218.20 --> 1218.40]  Hallelujah
[1218.40 --> 1219.40]  Hallelujah
[1219.40 --> 1223.52]  Death has lost its grip on me
[1223.52 --> 1227.06]  You have broken every chain
[1227.06 --> 1230.50]  There's salvation in Your name
[1230.50 --> 1236.10]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1236.10 --> 1243.20]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[1243.20 --> 1267.14]  Well, things are exciting this morning
[1267.14 --> 1272.50]  We continue to worship the Lord this morning
[1272.50 --> 1275.38]  In a time of confession
[1275.38 --> 1278.84]  Because though Jesus is our living hope
[1278.84 --> 1280.94]  So often we don't put our hope in Him
[1280.94 --> 1284.30]  We tend to put our hope in other things instead
[1284.30 --> 1287.72]  And so let us come before the Lord
[1287.72 --> 1290.44]  Acknowledging our wayward hearts
[1290.44 --> 1292.38]  And seeking the Spirit's help
[1292.38 --> 1296.64]  To turn our faces and turn our hearts back toward Him
[1296.64 --> 1298.68]  And lift up our hearts to Him
[1298.68 --> 1300.20]  And look to Him for forgiveness
[1300.20 --> 1304.34]  So let's say this short prayer of confession together
[1304.34 --> 1306.46]  And then it will give us a moment of silence
[1306.46 --> 1309.24]  Let's pray this together
[1309.24 --> 1310.42]  Good Lord
[1310.42 --> 1313.52]  Let us abound in love for You
[1313.52 --> 1314.90]  And for one another
[1314.90 --> 1317.64]  May You strengthen our hearts
[1317.64 --> 1320.86]  So that we will be blameless and holy
[1320.86 --> 1323.64]  In the presence of our God and Father
[1323.64 --> 1328.44]  When our Lord Jesus comes with all His holy ones
[1328.44 --> 1332.64]  And now, O Lord, in this moment of silence
[1332.64 --> 1336.78]  Hear us as we confess our sins to You
[1336.78 --> 1357.36]  Brothers and sisters
[1357.36 --> 1360.70]  We serve a God of limitless power and might
[1360.70 --> 1363.80]  Yet in all of His power
[1363.80 --> 1366.64]  He looks upon us in mercy
[1366.64 --> 1369.44]  And He draws us into His family
[1369.44 --> 1372.32]  Because of what Jesus Christ has done
[1372.32 --> 1377.00]  So God assures us of His grace
[1377.00 --> 1378.46]  Of His forgiveness, of His mercy
[1378.46 --> 1381.18]  With these words from Romans chapter 8
[1381.18 --> 1383.06]  And let's say these together
[1383.06 --> 1385.92]  Who then is the one who condemns?
[1386.98 --> 1387.96]  No one
[1387.96 --> 1390.30]  Christ Jesus who died
[1390.30 --> 1391.72]  More than that
[1391.72 --> 1393.32]  Who was raised to life
[1393.32 --> 1395.86]  Is at the right hand of God
[1395.86 --> 1399.28]  And is also interceding for us
[1399.28 --> 1403.24]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[1404.76 --> 1408.26]  I am convinced that neither death nor life
[1408.26 --> 1410.76]  Neither angels nor demons
[1410.76 --> 1413.74]  Neither the present nor the future
[1413.74 --> 1415.54]  Nor any powers
[1415.54 --> 1417.76]  Neither height nor depth
[1417.76 --> 1420.20]  Nor anything else in all creation
[1420.20 --> 1422.76]  Will be able to separate us
[1422.76 --> 1424.54]  From the love of God
[1424.54 --> 1427.72]  That is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1427.72 --> 1429.04]  Praise be to God
[1429.04 --> 1431.66]  Friends, as those who have been forgiven
[1431.66 --> 1434.44]  As those who have been made whole
[1434.44 --> 1438.34]  Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[1438.34 --> 1439.88]  Let us stand
[1439.88 --> 1441.26]  And let us sing together
[1441.26 --> 1442.76]  Of His grace to us
[1442.76 --> 1443.70]  Please stand
[1443.70 --> 1445.02]  And let us sing
[1445.02 --> 1462.44]  Amazing grace
[1462.44 --> 1465.44]  How sweet the sound
[1465.44 --> 1472.44]  That saved a wretch like me
[1472.44 --> 1476.44]  I once was lost
[1476.44 --> 1480.44]  But now I'm found
[1480.44 --> 1482.44]  Was blind
[1482.44 --> 1486.44]  But now I see
[1486.44 --> 1495.06]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1495.06 --> 1501.44]  And grace my fears relieved
[1501.44 --> 1509.66]  How precious did that grace appear
[1509.66 --> 1514.66]  The hour I first believed
[1514.66 --> 1519.66]  My chains are gone
[1519.66 --> 1522.66]  I've been set free
[1522.66 --> 1526.04]  My God, my Savior
[1526.04 --> 1529.66]  Has wrestled me
[1530.34 --> 1534.00]  And like a flood
[1534.00 --> 1536.66]  His mercy reigns
[1536.66 --> 1540.66]  Unending love
[1541.18 --> 1544.66]  Amazing grace
[1545.38 --> 1559.90]  The Lord has promised good to me
[1559.90 --> 1563.98]  His word my hope
[1563.98 --> 1569.98]  He will my shield
[1569.98 --> 1573.98]  And portion be
[1573.98 --> 1579.98]  As long as life endures
[1580.98 --> 1584.98]  Through many dangers
[1584.98 --> 1587.98]  Toils and snares
[1587.98 --> 1594.98]  I have already come
[1594.98 --> 1598.98]  T'is grace has brought me
[1598.98 --> 1601.98]  He saved thus far
[1601.98 --> 1607.98]  And grace will lead me home
[1607.98 --> 1611.98]  My chains are gone
[1611.98 --> 1614.98]  I've been set free
[1614.98 --> 1618.98]  My God, my Savior
[1618.98 --> 1621.98]  Has wrestled me
[1621.98 --> 1625.98]  And like a flood
[1625.98 --> 1629.98]  His mercy reigns
[1629.98 --> 1632.98]  Unending love
[1632.98 --> 1635.98]  Amazing grace
[1635.98 --> 1642.98]  When we've been there
[1642.98 --> 1644.98]  When we've been there
[1644.98 --> 1647.98]  Ten thousand years
[1647.98 --> 1652.98]  Right shining as the sun
[1652.98 --> 1656.98]  We've no less days
[1656.98 --> 1658.98]  To sing God's praise
[1658.98 --> 1668.98]  Than when we've first begun
[1668.98 --> 1669.98]  Amen
[1669.98 --> 1687.98]  So the children are now dismissed to go to their classes
[1687.98 --> 1689.98]  Let's pray for them
[1689.98 --> 1690.98]  Our Father
[1690.98 --> 1691.98]  Our Father we pray
[1691.98 --> 1692.98]  And thank you
[1692.98 --> 1693.98]  That you call the children
[1693.98 --> 1694.98]  To yourself
[1694.98 --> 1696.98]  And Lord we pray now
[1696.98 --> 1697.98]  That you would be with them
[1697.98 --> 1698.98]  As they go to their classes
[1698.98 --> 1700.98]  Would you help the teachers
[1700.98 --> 1702.98]  And Lord would each child
[1702.98 --> 1703.98]  Meet
[1704.98 --> 1705.98]  Jesus our Savior
[1705.98 --> 1707.98]  We pray in his holy name
[1707.98 --> 1708.98]  Amen
[1708.98 --> 1710.98]  So now we here
[1710.98 --> 1711.98]  Will turn our attention
[1711.98 --> 1712.98]  To God's word this morning
[1712.98 --> 1714.98]  And I will invite Emmanuel
[1714.98 --> 1719.98]  To come and read the passage for us this morning
[1719.98 --> 1724.98]  So let's pause for the next time
[1741.98 --> 1746.98]  So come back to the被rite Usually
[1746.98 --> 1748.98]  who are numaareous
[1748.98 --> 1755.74]  9, 13, inasema hivyo.
[1756.60 --> 1762.28]  Baba etu uliembingoni, jina lako takatifu uli tukuzwe.
[1763.06 --> 1766.88]  Ufalmwa kooje, mapenzi yako yatimizwe.
[1767.60 --> 1769.24]  Hapa dunya ni kama mbingoni.
[1770.94 --> 1775.56]  Utupeleo riziki etu, utusamee makosa etu.
[1775.56 --> 1778.48]  Kama sisi nasi tunawasamehivyo.
[1778.98 --> 1807.92]  I think it's been wonderful hearing all these different languages read each week as we've studied the Lord's Prayer.
[1807.92 --> 1819.40]  And it's a foretaste of what heaven will be like as people from every language, tribe, tongue, and nation will be gathered around the throne of God in worship of him.
[1820.64 --> 1825.70]  So also, as we've been in this series, we've been reading through the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1826.04 --> 1829.14]  And so today we will read question 127.
[1830.14 --> 1832.64]  What does the sixth petition mean?
[1833.72 --> 1834.40]  Together.
[1834.40 --> 1842.52]  And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one means.
[1844.28 --> 1849.88]  By ourselves, we are too weak to hold our own, even for a moment.
[1849.88 --> 1858.02]  And our sworn enemies, the devil, the world, and our own flesh, never stop attacking us.
[1859.58 --> 1865.78]  And so, Lord, uphold us and make us strong with the strength of your Holy Spirit,
[1865.78 --> 1870.74]  so that we may not go down to defeat in this spiritual struggle,
[1871.28 --> 1877.72]  but may firmly resist our enemies until we finally win the complete victory.
[1877.72 --> 1879.40]  Amen.
[1880.40 --> 1881.50]  Let's pray together.
[1885.04 --> 1888.18]  Our Heavenly Father, we are in a spiritual battle.
[1891.22 --> 1900.42]  There's a battle going on for our hearts, for your church, for this very world.
[1900.42 --> 1907.48]  Lord, we come to you this morning and pray that you would reign as king over us,
[1908.16 --> 1910.50]  that you would help us to win this battle.
[1911.72 --> 1915.22]  And so, Lord, we look to you and we look to your word
[1915.22 --> 1921.02]  to teach us, to shape us and sharpen us, to strengthen us in faith.
[1921.74 --> 1926.88]  So, Lord, would you meet us in this word and in this moment?
[1926.88 --> 1929.50]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1931.66 --> 1935.18]  So, today is the last Sunday in the church season of Epiphany,
[1935.30 --> 1941.64]  which is the season when the church looks to the life and ministry and teachings of Jesus Christ.
[1942.52 --> 1946.28]  And the way that we have been doing that over these last several weeks
[1946.28 --> 1951.00]  is in a sermon series on the Lord's Prayer from Matthew chapter 6.
[1951.00 --> 1955.64]  And what we've been doing is each week just going petition by petition,
[1956.16 --> 1959.54]  going deeper into the prayer to understand what it means
[1959.54 --> 1962.02]  and how Jesus is teaching us to pray.
[1963.36 --> 1967.10]  And today we come to the end of the Lord's Prayer, sadly,
[1967.80 --> 1969.76]  the sixth and final petition.
[1970.28 --> 1973.96]  And we're going to take some time to reflect on that this morning.
[1973.96 --> 1980.70]  Before we get into it, you know, probably, I'm sure many of us are familiar with the composer,
[1981.26 --> 1982.54]  Johann Sebastian Bach.
[1982.66 --> 1985.12]  And we'll put his beautiful portrait up.
[1985.60 --> 1986.24]  There he is.
[1987.12 --> 1991.66]  He wrote such great hits as Ode to Joy, Ave Maria,
[1992.48 --> 1997.66]  the Brandenburg Concertos, and many, many other things, about a thousand works.
[1997.66 --> 2003.12]  I read that two-thirds of them, or three-fourths, actually, three-fourths were written for worship.
[2005.14 --> 2007.14]  And I also discovered something else.
[2007.30 --> 2011.50]  I discovered recently that he was known for jotting down initials
[2011.50 --> 2016.70]  on both the top and bottom of the sheets of music that he was writing.
[2017.82 --> 2021.68]  He regularly signed his works on the bottom of the sheet,
[2021.68 --> 2028.24]  both with his name, as you can see there, and with the initials SDG,
[2029.22 --> 2030.90]  which stands for a Latin phrase,
[2031.72 --> 2032.92]  Soli Deo Gloria,
[2033.76 --> 2036.32]  which means to God alone be the glory.
[2038.30 --> 2040.60]  Bach's idea was that his music was intended
[2040.60 --> 2043.48]  to express something about God,
[2043.88 --> 2046.32]  not just something about himself.
[2047.64 --> 2050.94]  But then, on the top of the sheets of music,
[2050.94 --> 2056.70]  as he was beginning to sit down and to compose a new piece of music,
[2056.90 --> 2058.86]  Bach put a different set of initials.
[2059.08 --> 2060.74]  He put the initials JJ.
[2061.08 --> 2063.08]  This might be harder to see, but up there on the left,
[2063.66 --> 2064.74]  you can see JJ.
[2065.80 --> 2066.72]  There's the blocks around it.
[2068.10 --> 2071.06]  It stands for Jesu Juva.
[2071.88 --> 2073.28]  It's also a Latin phrase,
[2073.28 --> 2074.30]  and it simply means,
[2075.26 --> 2076.60]  Jesus, help me.
[2076.60 --> 2082.36]  Even Bach, with his incredible talent
[2082.36 --> 2084.30]  and his genius for composition,
[2085.02 --> 2088.24]  he appealed to God for help
[2088.24 --> 2090.92]  when he sat down to write his music.
[2091.02 --> 2093.06]  He believed that without Jesus helping him,
[2093.18 --> 2095.32]  it just wasn't going to happen.
[2096.12 --> 2098.98]  He wouldn't be able to write this amazing music
[2098.98 --> 2101.14]  without Jesus helping him.
[2101.20 --> 2102.44]  So he wrote this prayer,
[2104.20 --> 2105.40]  Jesu Juva,
[2106.40 --> 2107.90]  Jesus, help me.
[2109.28 --> 2112.76]  Well, today, as we finish our series in the Lord's Prayer,
[2113.02 --> 2115.68]  Jesus teaches us in this final petition,
[2115.90 --> 2117.28]  lead us not into temptation,
[2117.78 --> 2120.06]  but deliver us from the evil one.
[2120.06 --> 2122.08]  And Jesus is saying here,
[2122.20 --> 2125.02]  across the top of each of our lives,
[2125.50 --> 2127.90]  he's teaching us to write this phrase,
[2128.32 --> 2129.74]  Jesus, help me.
[2130.98 --> 2132.14]  Jesus, help me.
[2133.10 --> 2135.48]  There is something that's not going to be done
[2135.48 --> 2140.10]  unless God intervenes and he helps.
[2141.92 --> 2144.48]  Jesus is telling us that there are powers,
[2145.10 --> 2147.62]  there are forces at work in our world,
[2147.72 --> 2149.04]  far beyond our control.
[2149.04 --> 2152.98]  And that we need intervention.
[2153.50 --> 2155.10]  We need rescue.
[2155.88 --> 2156.92]  We need God's help.
[2157.62 --> 2159.12]  So Jesus teaches us to pray,
[2159.28 --> 2160.08]  Jesus, help.
[2160.76 --> 2161.88]  Deliver us, Lord,
[2162.58 --> 2165.68]  from temptation and from the tempter.
[2166.96 --> 2169.66]  Jesus is teaching us we can't do it on our own.
[2170.32 --> 2173.64]  We are not spiritual superheroes,
[2174.30 --> 2177.72]  therefore, we must be prayer warriors.
[2177.72 --> 2180.08]  We must pray,
[2180.50 --> 2183.28]  Jesus, help.
[2184.56 --> 2186.34]  Now to pray this prayer well,
[2186.42 --> 2188.04]  this final petition of the Lord's Prayer,
[2188.44 --> 2190.62]  I think we need to understand two things.
[2190.76 --> 2192.88]  This is kind of the way we've been looking at each petition.
[2193.38 --> 2195.14]  First, just what does this petition mean?
[2195.14 --> 2200.30]  What are we asking God for when we pray this petition?
[2201.30 --> 2204.26]  And then secondly, knowing what it means,
[2204.34 --> 2206.30]  how does that shape our prayers?
[2206.36 --> 2208.68]  Remember, this is a model that Jesus gives us
[2208.68 --> 2210.06]  that we are to riff on,
[2210.12 --> 2211.00]  that we are to take,
[2211.66 --> 2213.78]  to teach us what God's own heart is,
[2214.08 --> 2215.86]  to shape our own desires,
[2215.98 --> 2217.74]  to desire what God desires,
[2217.74 --> 2220.32]  and then to use that to pray to him
[2220.32 --> 2222.36]  for all of the concerns of our lives.
[2223.14 --> 2224.32]  How should we then pray?
[2224.82 --> 2225.82]  That's our second question.
[2226.34 --> 2227.76]  So that's what I want to look at this morning.
[2228.32 --> 2230.60]  First, let's get deeper into this prayer
[2230.60 --> 2232.22]  to try to understand it.
[2232.68 --> 2235.12]  Because as we look at this last petition,
[2235.38 --> 2236.00]  in particular,
[2236.44 --> 2237.96]  a lot of people wonder,
[2238.52 --> 2239.52]  what in the world
[2239.52 --> 2242.14]  does that first part of the petition mean?
[2242.14 --> 2247.08]  Lead us not into temptation.
[2248.26 --> 2250.44]  As soon as we consider that
[2250.44 --> 2253.76]  and take those words into our own prayer,
[2254.22 --> 2254.82]  we ask,
[2255.54 --> 2258.62]  does that suggest that God perhaps does
[2258.62 --> 2260.34]  sometimes lead us into temptation?
[2261.68 --> 2261.90]  Right?
[2262.00 --> 2263.90]  Would our Heavenly Father,
[2264.02 --> 2266.66]  the Heavenly Father that Jesus teaches us to pray to,
[2267.38 --> 2270.30]  would he lead us into situations
[2270.30 --> 2273.04]  that tempt us into sin?
[2274.76 --> 2276.08]  Well, the answer is,
[2276.20 --> 2276.90]  no, he doesn't.
[2277.76 --> 2278.96]  The scriptures are clear
[2278.96 --> 2281.62]  that God is not a tempter.
[2282.88 --> 2285.16]  James 1, 13 says,
[2285.96 --> 2286.64]  when tempted,
[2286.88 --> 2287.66]  no one should say,
[2287.76 --> 2288.78]  God is tempting me,
[2288.84 --> 2290.66]  for God cannot be tempted by evil,
[2290.92 --> 2292.66]  nor does he tempt anyone.
[2294.28 --> 2295.98]  So then the question becomes,
[2296.14 --> 2296.32]  well,
[2297.00 --> 2298.64]  if God does not tempt anyone,
[2298.92 --> 2299.56]  why pray,
[2299.56 --> 2300.86]  lead us not into temptation?
[2302.08 --> 2302.30]  Right?
[2302.34 --> 2304.24]  Why bother asking God to do something
[2304.24 --> 2306.38]  that God says he will never do?
[2307.12 --> 2307.34]  Right?
[2307.36 --> 2308.62]  Are we just wasting our breath?
[2309.86 --> 2310.90]  And I think, you know,
[2310.94 --> 2311.92]  the key to understanding
[2311.92 --> 2313.12]  what Jesus means here
[2313.12 --> 2315.96]  is that the Greek word translated temptation
[2315.96 --> 2317.82]  has two different meanings.
[2318.92 --> 2320.82]  One meaning is test,
[2321.80 --> 2322.44]  or trial.
[2322.94 --> 2324.38]  The other is temptation.
[2324.88 --> 2326.90]  And those are two very different things.
[2327.56 --> 2327.74]  Right?
[2327.80 --> 2328.60]  What's a test?
[2328.60 --> 2330.90]  A test is something meant
[2330.90 --> 2333.02]  to prove one's character
[2333.02 --> 2335.22]  and in the process
[2335.22 --> 2337.52]  to strengthen and improve
[2337.52 --> 2338.96]  one's character.
[2339.66 --> 2340.92]  But a temptation
[2340.92 --> 2344.24]  is meant to entice a person to sin.
[2345.54 --> 2346.32]  A test,
[2346.38 --> 2347.16]  you can think of it like this,
[2347.20 --> 2349.26]  a test is meant to build you up.
[2350.06 --> 2350.70]  A temptation
[2350.70 --> 2353.16]  is meant to tear someone down
[2353.16 --> 2353.84]  in some way.
[2353.84 --> 2355.86]  You know,
[2355.96 --> 2357.88]  and I think all of us here
[2357.88 --> 2358.26]  can attest
[2358.26 --> 2360.82]  to the fact
[2360.82 --> 2361.98]  that when we look around
[2361.98 --> 2362.74]  at our lives,
[2363.26 --> 2365.58]  that we are not given a pass
[2365.58 --> 2368.00]  at facing challenging situations
[2368.00 --> 2369.84]  and suffering in our life
[2369.84 --> 2371.60]  just because we are Christians,
[2372.14 --> 2373.62]  just because we believe in Jesus.
[2374.52 --> 2374.72]  Right?
[2374.72 --> 2376.14]  We here are not given
[2376.14 --> 2378.58]  a pass on cancer,
[2379.26 --> 2380.50]  on joblessness,
[2380.94 --> 2382.18]  on conflicts
[2382.18 --> 2383.40]  in our marriages
[2383.40 --> 2384.40]  or with our children.
[2384.78 --> 2386.20]  We are not given a pass
[2386.20 --> 2387.64]  on war and persecution.
[2388.84 --> 2389.06]  Right?
[2389.14 --> 2389.94]  You name it,
[2390.94 --> 2392.26]  we do not get a pass
[2392.26 --> 2393.56]  on the pain and difficulty
[2393.56 --> 2395.78]  in the trials of this life.
[2395.78 --> 2398.46]  And in these situations
[2398.46 --> 2400.76]  that all of us
[2400.76 --> 2402.62]  will face in our lives
[2402.62 --> 2404.20]  can either be a test
[2404.20 --> 2406.58]  to strengthen our faith in God
[2406.58 --> 2408.58]  or a temptation
[2408.58 --> 2410.62]  enticing us to sin
[2410.62 --> 2412.24]  against God and doubt Him.
[2413.36 --> 2415.06]  And whether it's a test
[2415.06 --> 2416.18]  or a temptation
[2416.18 --> 2418.08]  depends on us,
[2418.56 --> 2419.98]  depends on how we respond.
[2421.12 --> 2422.96]  So God is never a tempter,
[2423.80 --> 2425.68]  but He does allow us
[2425.68 --> 2427.58]  to go through tests
[2427.58 --> 2430.00]  and trials for our good.
[2431.14 --> 2432.72]  James 1 says very clearly
[2432.72 --> 2434.78]  in verses 2 to 4,
[2436.10 --> 2436.40]  He says,
[2436.48 --> 2438.20]  Consider it pure joy,
[2438.78 --> 2439.88]  my brothers and sisters,
[2440.54 --> 2442.26]  whenever you face trials
[2442.26 --> 2443.62]  of many kinds,
[2443.96 --> 2444.92]  because you know
[2444.92 --> 2446.46]  that the testing of your faith
[2446.46 --> 2447.56]  produces perseverance.
[2448.22 --> 2450.24]  Let perseverance finish its work
[2450.24 --> 2451.56]  so that you may be mature
[2451.56 --> 2452.28]  and complete,
[2452.84 --> 2454.20]  not lacking in anything.
[2454.62 --> 2454.74]  Right?
[2454.74 --> 2456.56]  This is God's good intentions
[2456.56 --> 2457.28]  and desires
[2457.28 --> 2458.82]  in our trials,
[2459.00 --> 2460.42]  that He would use them
[2460.42 --> 2461.98]  to strengthen us in faith,
[2462.06 --> 2464.96]  to make us beautiful believers
[2464.96 --> 2466.12]  and followers of Him.
[2467.86 --> 2468.46]  You know,
[2468.52 --> 2470.74]  this reminds me of diamonds.
[2471.46 --> 2472.80]  Do you know how diamonds are formed?
[2473.48 --> 2474.30]  They're formed
[2474.30 --> 2476.38]  with pressure,
[2476.46 --> 2476.84]  that's right.
[2477.20 --> 2478.58]  Crushing pressure
[2478.58 --> 2480.26]  pressure and intense heat.
[2480.26 --> 2485.06]  And so when the trials
[2485.06 --> 2486.60]  and the tests come upon you,
[2486.84 --> 2487.92]  which they will
[2487.92 --> 2489.26]  for each and every one of us,
[2489.46 --> 2490.56]  if you respond
[2490.56 --> 2491.80]  to that test
[2491.80 --> 2492.60]  with honesty
[2492.60 --> 2493.90]  and faithfulness
[2493.90 --> 2494.62]  and perseverance
[2494.62 --> 2495.58]  and compassion,
[2495.90 --> 2496.86]  if you're faithful,
[2497.18 --> 2498.02]  what happens?
[2498.68 --> 2499.90]  It will just turn you
[2499.90 --> 2500.86]  into a diamond.
[2500.86 --> 2503.32]  But if you respond
[2503.32 --> 2505.04]  in this trial
[2505.04 --> 2507.24]  with impatience
[2507.24 --> 2508.40]  and with bitterness
[2508.40 --> 2510.04]  and with selfishness,
[2510.24 --> 2511.80]  it will ruin you.
[2512.88 --> 2514.08]  You won't become a diamond,
[2514.20 --> 2514.94]  you will be crushed
[2514.94 --> 2515.78]  into coal dust.
[2517.08 --> 2517.56]  See,
[2517.64 --> 2518.72]  so it's not the suffering
[2518.72 --> 2519.72]  that will defeat you,
[2519.78 --> 2520.40]  it's sin.
[2521.50 --> 2522.72]  It's how you respond
[2522.72 --> 2523.50]  to the test.
[2524.46 --> 2524.62]  You know,
[2525.00 --> 2527.08]  10,000 tons of suffering
[2527.08 --> 2527.66]  and trial
[2527.66 --> 2529.44]  will not hurt you,
[2529.70 --> 2530.64]  but one ounce
[2530.64 --> 2531.78]  of sin will crush you.
[2533.74 --> 2534.22]  Eventually,
[2534.56 --> 2535.80]  the trial will pass.
[2536.64 --> 2537.56]  But as long
[2537.56 --> 2538.54]  as you are obeying
[2538.54 --> 2539.46]  and trusting in God,
[2539.56 --> 2540.80]  you're growing spiritually.
[2541.34 --> 2542.94]  Your faith is like gold
[2542.94 --> 2544.26]  that is being purified.
[2545.08 --> 2546.22]  You're being conformed
[2546.22 --> 2547.62]  into the image of Christ.
[2549.84 --> 2551.04]  And so we pray,
[2551.96 --> 2552.30]  Father,
[2552.52 --> 2553.62]  as you lead us
[2553.62 --> 2555.22]  into the time of testing,
[2555.72 --> 2557.02]  do not let the test
[2557.02 --> 2557.90]  become a temptation.
[2559.18 --> 2560.06]  That's what we pray.
[2562.14 --> 2563.26]  And so that's the first part
[2563.26 --> 2563.90]  of this petition,
[2564.58 --> 2565.66]  but this petition
[2565.66 --> 2566.56]  has two parts.
[2566.90 --> 2567.92]  And the second part
[2567.92 --> 2568.74]  helps us understand
[2568.74 --> 2569.34]  the first part.
[2570.14 --> 2570.96]  The second part
[2570.96 --> 2572.20]  of the temptation says,
[2572.70 --> 2573.54]  yeah, not that yet,
[2573.62 --> 2573.82]  sorry.
[2574.96 --> 2575.60]  The second part
[2575.60 --> 2576.64]  of the temptation says,
[2576.64 --> 2577.98]  but deliver us
[2577.98 --> 2578.84]  from the evil one.
[2581.06 --> 2581.96]  Deliver us
[2581.96 --> 2582.80]  from the evil one.
[2583.86 --> 2584.72]  Jesus here
[2584.72 --> 2586.78]  is naming a reality.
[2586.78 --> 2587.50]  It's a reality
[2587.50 --> 2588.64]  that we in our
[2588.64 --> 2589.66]  Western modern world
[2589.66 --> 2592.06]  often do not think of.
[2593.02 --> 2593.90]  And that reality
[2593.90 --> 2595.54]  is not just that it is
[2595.54 --> 2597.38]  that we give in easily
[2597.38 --> 2598.16]  to temptation,
[2598.60 --> 2600.60]  but that behind the temptation
[2600.60 --> 2601.94]  is a tempter.
[2603.16 --> 2603.28]  Right?
[2603.34 --> 2605.02]  Behind the evil in the world,
[2605.02 --> 2606.02]  the Bible says,
[2606.42 --> 2607.66]  is an evil one.
[2607.66 --> 2610.34]  1 Peter 5a
[2610.34 --> 2611.24]  calls the devil
[2611.24 --> 2612.30]  our adversary.
[2613.30 --> 2614.80]  It says he's prowling
[2614.80 --> 2615.94]  around like a lion
[2615.94 --> 2617.54]  trying to devour us.
[2618.64 --> 2620.36]  In John 10,
[2620.44 --> 2620.98]  verse 10,
[2621.14 --> 2621.94]  Jesus calls him
[2621.94 --> 2622.48]  a thief
[2622.48 --> 2623.98]  who is trying
[2623.98 --> 2624.66]  to steal
[2624.66 --> 2625.28]  and kill
[2625.28 --> 2626.00]  and destroy.
[2627.58 --> 2629.00]  Revelation 12,
[2629.12 --> 2629.54]  9
[2629.54 --> 2630.46]  calls him
[2630.46 --> 2631.46]  the ancient serpent,
[2632.18 --> 2632.94]  the deceiver
[2632.94 --> 2634.24]  of the whole world.
[2634.24 --> 2637.38]  There's a book
[2637.38 --> 2638.24]  by C.S. Lewis
[2638.24 --> 2638.82]  called
[2638.82 --> 2640.14]  The Screwtape Letters.
[2640.62 --> 2641.68]  Has anybody ever read it?
[2642.74 --> 2643.28]  A couple.
[2643.46 --> 2643.96]  A couple of you.
[2645.06 --> 2646.14]  It's a fiction.
[2647.62 --> 2648.82]  It's written as a fiction.
[2649.68 --> 2650.16]  It's about
[2650.16 --> 2651.18]  an older demon,
[2651.42 --> 2652.02]  Screwtape,
[2652.06 --> 2652.84]  who writes
[2652.84 --> 2654.00]  to his young nephew,
[2654.46 --> 2654.70]  demon,
[2655.34 --> 2656.42]  whose name is Wormwood.
[2656.42 --> 2657.36]  And Wormwood
[2657.36 --> 2658.72]  has been assigned
[2658.72 --> 2660.46]  to a certain young man
[2660.46 --> 2661.30]  who has just become
[2661.30 --> 2661.80]  a Christian.
[2662.70 --> 2663.58]  And Screwtape,
[2663.68 --> 2664.06]  the uncle,
[2664.20 --> 2665.04]  gives Wormwood,
[2665.18 --> 2665.62]  the nephew,
[2666.38 --> 2666.98]  instructions
[2666.98 --> 2668.78]  for how
[2668.78 --> 2670.30]  to pull this young man
[2670.30 --> 2671.36]  away from Christ.
[2671.78 --> 2672.68]  That's their job.
[2673.86 --> 2674.52]  And Wormwood
[2674.52 --> 2675.04]  is given
[2675.04 --> 2676.10]  some strategies
[2676.10 --> 2677.56]  in how to do this.
[2678.32 --> 2679.08]  He's told,
[2679.80 --> 2681.56]  remind this young man
[2681.56 --> 2683.32]  about the health concerns
[2683.32 --> 2683.94]  of his mother.
[2683.94 --> 2686.88]  Don't let him forget.
[2688.38 --> 2689.80]  Plant in his mind
[2689.80 --> 2691.06]  how unjust
[2691.06 --> 2691.90]  and frustrating
[2691.90 --> 2692.86]  and fruitless
[2692.86 --> 2693.80]  is his work
[2693.80 --> 2694.68]  from nine to five.
[2695.84 --> 2697.00]  Give him reasons
[2697.00 --> 2698.56]  to get mad at God.
[2700.56 --> 2702.40]  It's an amazing book.
[2702.50 --> 2703.02]  It's insightful.
[2703.28 --> 2704.40]  I recommend it.
[2705.18 --> 2706.40]  And it reminds us
[2706.40 --> 2707.34]  that as we go
[2707.34 --> 2708.90]  through trials and tests,
[2709.40 --> 2710.28]  all the challenges
[2710.28 --> 2711.96]  that we face in life,
[2712.58 --> 2713.92]  there is a tempter
[2713.92 --> 2715.06]  who would seek
[2715.06 --> 2716.34]  to lead us away
[2716.34 --> 2717.18]  from trusting
[2717.18 --> 2718.32]  our Heavenly Father.
[2720.06 --> 2721.78]  So what the tempter does,
[2722.38 --> 2723.58]  what the evil one does,
[2723.62 --> 2724.56]  is he seeks
[2724.56 --> 2725.82]  to turn tests
[2725.82 --> 2727.62]  into temptations.
[2728.82 --> 2729.06]  Right?
[2729.14 --> 2729.94]  There are events
[2729.94 --> 2730.62]  and experiences
[2730.62 --> 2731.26]  in life
[2731.26 --> 2732.06]  through which
[2732.06 --> 2732.94]  our Heavenly Father
[2732.94 --> 2733.58]  desires
[2733.58 --> 2735.30]  to grow our faith,
[2735.38 --> 2736.32]  to sharpen us,
[2736.38 --> 2737.40]  to purify us,
[2737.48 --> 2738.56]  but the evil one
[2738.56 --> 2739.32]  sneaks in
[2739.32 --> 2739.90]  and desires
[2739.90 --> 2741.50]  to use those same tests
[2741.50 --> 2743.26]  to destroy our faith.
[2743.26 --> 2745.80]  So we pray.
[2746.06 --> 2746.80]  Jesus teaches us
[2746.80 --> 2747.18]  to pray.
[2747.72 --> 2747.88]  Pray,
[2748.08 --> 2748.36]  Father,
[2748.52 --> 2749.34]  as you lead us
[2749.34 --> 2750.14]  into the time
[2750.14 --> 2750.72]  of testing,
[2751.10 --> 2752.76]  do not let the test
[2752.76 --> 2753.78]  become a temptation,
[2754.36 --> 2755.52]  but deliver us
[2755.52 --> 2756.28]  from the evil one
[2756.28 --> 2756.80]  who seeks
[2756.80 --> 2758.14]  to destroy our faith.
[2758.76 --> 2760.02]  Help us to trust you
[2760.02 --> 2761.34]  and not turn away
[2761.34 --> 2761.80]  from you.
[2763.16 --> 2764.04]  That's what Jesus
[2764.04 --> 2764.82]  is teaching us
[2764.82 --> 2765.46]  to pray here.
[2767.40 --> 2768.42]  And that leads us
[2768.42 --> 2769.46]  to the second thing
[2769.46 --> 2770.28]  that I want us
[2770.28 --> 2771.08]  to look at this morning,
[2771.08 --> 2772.68]  which is exactly
[2772.68 --> 2773.30]  what does it mean
[2773.30 --> 2773.80]  then to pray
[2773.80 --> 2774.38]  this petition?
[2774.82 --> 2775.80]  How do we pray this?
[2776.64 --> 2777.52]  And in particular,
[2777.52 --> 2778.76]  when we pray
[2778.76 --> 2779.96]  that last part,
[2780.04 --> 2781.24]  deliver us from evil,
[2782.08 --> 2782.30]  well,
[2782.38 --> 2782.90]  what are some
[2782.90 --> 2783.44]  of the ways
[2783.44 --> 2784.90]  that the scriptures
[2784.90 --> 2785.76]  talk about
[2785.76 --> 2786.62]  us being delivered
[2786.62 --> 2787.22]  from evil?
[2787.90 --> 2788.76]  And then what
[2788.76 --> 2790.26]  does that teach us
[2790.26 --> 2791.04]  for how we can
[2791.04 --> 2792.10]  shape our own prayers?
[2792.10 --> 2794.70]  So let's think
[2794.70 --> 2795.78]  together about
[2795.78 --> 2796.96]  how the scriptures
[2796.96 --> 2798.28]  speak about God
[2798.28 --> 2799.14]  delivering us
[2799.14 --> 2799.60]  from evil.
[2800.42 --> 2801.54]  And then what ideas
[2801.54 --> 2802.30]  does that spark
[2802.30 --> 2802.88]  in us
[2802.88 --> 2804.04]  for how we can pray?
[2805.76 --> 2806.28]  First,
[2806.48 --> 2807.84]  God delivers us
[2807.84 --> 2808.88]  by helping us
[2808.88 --> 2809.96]  to recognize evil,
[2810.90 --> 2811.46]  to help us
[2811.46 --> 2812.16]  recognize it.
[2812.76 --> 2812.96]  You know,
[2813.06 --> 2813.84]  in the scriptures,
[2814.02 --> 2814.78]  God's presence
[2814.78 --> 2815.88]  is often described
[2815.88 --> 2816.60]  as a light.
[2817.74 --> 2818.38]  And of course,
[2818.48 --> 2819.48]  the primary function
[2819.48 --> 2820.26]  of light
[2820.26 --> 2822.26]  is to illuminate
[2822.26 --> 2823.30]  that which is hidden.
[2824.32 --> 2825.32]  If you're camping
[2825.32 --> 2826.14]  and you're walking
[2826.14 --> 2827.48]  along a dark path
[2827.48 --> 2828.46]  at night,
[2828.60 --> 2829.66]  you click on
[2829.66 --> 2830.42]  the headlight
[2830.42 --> 2832.56]  and your path
[2832.56 --> 2833.26]  is illumined.
[2833.32 --> 2833.88]  You can see
[2833.88 --> 2834.58]  so you don't trip
[2834.58 --> 2835.18]  on a root
[2835.18 --> 2835.74]  and also
[2835.74 --> 2836.84]  so that you can see
[2836.84 --> 2837.90]  if there are any bears.
[2839.78 --> 2841.58]  One of the first ways
[2841.58 --> 2842.26]  then that God
[2842.26 --> 2843.28]  helps deliver us
[2843.28 --> 2843.78]  from evil
[2843.78 --> 2844.72]  is to help us
[2844.72 --> 2845.68]  to see it clearly,
[2846.24 --> 2847.48]  to recognize it.
[2847.56 --> 2848.76]  He turns on
[2848.76 --> 2849.80]  the light.
[2851.00 --> 2851.16]  You know,
[2851.22 --> 2851.88]  when challenges
[2851.88 --> 2852.62]  and trials
[2852.62 --> 2853.16]  and tests
[2853.16 --> 2854.36]  come into our lives,
[2854.72 --> 2856.60]  sometimes we can't
[2856.60 --> 2857.36]  see clearly.
[2858.04 --> 2859.38]  But if we can see
[2859.38 --> 2859.94]  underneath
[2859.94 --> 2861.64]  and behind the trial,
[2862.00 --> 2863.70]  recognize the temptations
[2863.70 --> 2864.82]  that could come
[2864.82 --> 2865.68]  to us
[2865.68 --> 2866.18]  in the midst
[2866.18 --> 2866.90]  of that trial,
[2867.32 --> 2867.82]  temptations
[2867.82 --> 2868.54]  to doubt
[2868.54 --> 2869.60]  God's presence,
[2869.72 --> 2870.10]  to doubt
[2870.10 --> 2870.70]  his goodness,
[2871.32 --> 2872.72]  that can actually
[2872.72 --> 2873.40]  help us
[2873.40 --> 2874.88]  be delivered from it.
[2875.48 --> 2876.48]  If we can just be,
[2877.16 --> 2878.18]  if we can recognize
[2878.18 --> 2878.68]  the evil,
[2878.82 --> 2879.56]  we can recognize
[2879.56 --> 2880.18]  the temptation,
[2880.48 --> 2881.26]  that's one way
[2881.26 --> 2882.38]  God delivers us.
[2883.72 --> 2884.70]  Because evil,
[2884.90 --> 2885.14]  friends,
[2885.30 --> 2886.26]  is trying
[2886.26 --> 2887.60]  to deceive us.
[2888.24 --> 2888.86]  It's trying
[2888.86 --> 2890.18]  to go unnoticed
[2890.18 --> 2891.58]  and to get
[2891.58 --> 2892.46]  into the background
[2892.46 --> 2893.66]  and seem normal.
[2894.94 --> 2895.54]  But if God
[2895.54 --> 2896.56]  will shine
[2896.56 --> 2897.24]  his spotlight
[2897.24 --> 2897.84]  on it
[2897.84 --> 2899.02]  so we can see evil
[2899.02 --> 2900.06]  and we can see
[2900.06 --> 2900.76]  the temptation,
[2901.80 --> 2902.84]  we can be delivered.
[2902.84 --> 2905.94]  So we pray
[2905.94 --> 2906.40]  that God
[2906.40 --> 2906.92]  would help us
[2906.92 --> 2907.46]  to recognize
[2907.46 --> 2908.52]  evil and temptation,
[2908.64 --> 2909.28]  to be aware of it,
[2909.30 --> 2910.38]  to see it for what it is.
[2911.02 --> 2911.44]  Second,
[2911.72 --> 2912.62]  God delivers us
[2912.62 --> 2913.38]  by helping us
[2913.38 --> 2914.36]  to resist evil.
[2915.64 --> 2916.54]  God intends
[2916.54 --> 2917.30]  for us not simply
[2917.30 --> 2918.42]  to recognize evil,
[2918.66 --> 2918.96]  to say,
[2919.12 --> 2919.22]  okay,
[2919.34 --> 2919.74]  there it is,
[2919.76 --> 2920.32]  there's temptation.
[2920.84 --> 2921.86]  He says you actually
[2921.86 --> 2923.20]  have to resist it.
[2923.20 --> 2926.84]  How do we resist
[2926.84 --> 2927.34]  the devil?
[2929.56 --> 2930.34]  This passage
[2930.34 --> 2931.66]  I mentioned earlier,
[2931.72 --> 2932.00]  remember,
[2932.12 --> 2932.66]  about Satan
[2932.66 --> 2933.80]  as a roaring lion.
[2934.92 --> 2935.80]  Peter immediately
[2935.80 --> 2936.46]  follows up
[2936.46 --> 2937.24]  that passage
[2937.24 --> 2938.26]  and says this
[2938.26 --> 2939.74]  in 1 Peter 5-9,
[2940.26 --> 2941.12]  resist him.
[2942.44 --> 2943.58]  He's a roaring lion,
[2943.82 --> 2944.50]  resist him,
[2944.92 --> 2945.64]  stand firm
[2945.64 --> 2946.26]  in the faith.
[2947.30 --> 2947.90]  That's how he can
[2947.90 --> 2948.52]  resist the devil.
[2949.62 --> 2950.48]  And then James,
[2950.78 --> 2951.44]  chapter 4,
[2951.52 --> 2951.96]  verse 7,
[2952.08 --> 2952.30]  says,
[2952.30 --> 2954.06]  submit yourselves
[2954.06 --> 2955.18]  then to God.
[2955.78 --> 2956.44]  Submit yourselves
[2956.44 --> 2956.88]  to God
[2956.88 --> 2957.24]  in the midst
[2957.24 --> 2957.86]  of your trials.
[2958.38 --> 2959.24]  Resist the devil
[2959.24 --> 2960.12]  and he will flee
[2960.12 --> 2960.66]  from you.
[2962.12 --> 2962.78]  In the midst
[2962.78 --> 2963.38]  of trials,
[2963.66 --> 2964.16]  when temptation
[2964.16 --> 2964.66]  comes,
[2964.88 --> 2965.56]  when the evil one
[2965.56 --> 2966.50]  is trying to deceive,
[2967.28 --> 2967.96]  submit yourselves
[2967.96 --> 2968.54]  to God.
[2969.46 --> 2970.36]  Resist the devil,
[2970.98 --> 2971.62]  he will flee
[2971.62 --> 2972.02]  from you.
[2972.32 --> 2972.84]  He will see
[2972.84 --> 2973.86]  he has no chance.
[2976.46 --> 2977.44]  One of the ways
[2977.44 --> 2978.52]  God delivers us
[2978.52 --> 2979.84]  is by filling us
[2979.84 --> 2981.04]  with the power
[2981.04 --> 2982.06]  to resist.
[2983.16 --> 2984.08]  And that actually
[2984.08 --> 2986.18]  takes several forms
[2986.18 --> 2986.90]  of its own.
[2987.58 --> 2988.58]  One is by praying.
[2988.70 --> 2989.36]  How do we resist?
[2989.52 --> 2990.44]  We resist by prayer.
[2991.44 --> 2992.32]  To resist evil,
[2992.44 --> 2993.14]  we need to be
[2993.14 --> 2994.18]  constantly,
[2994.70 --> 2995.80]  steadfastly
[2995.80 --> 2997.50]  praying against evil
[2997.50 --> 2999.10]  wherever we see it.
[3000.38 --> 3001.86]  And God has promised us,
[3001.90 --> 3002.50]  and one of the things
[3002.50 --> 3003.24]  we're talking about
[3003.24 --> 3004.22]  in this whole series
[3004.22 --> 3005.02]  on the Lord's Prayer
[3005.02 --> 3006.78]  is that God promises
[3006.78 --> 3007.72]  to act
[3007.72 --> 3008.54]  in response
[3008.54 --> 3009.28]  to our prayer.
[3009.28 --> 3009.34]  prayer.
[3011.02 --> 3012.00]  It's one of the great
[3012.00 --> 3013.46]  mysteries of the Christian life.
[3013.84 --> 3014.94]  He is often waiting
[3014.94 --> 3015.84]  for us to pray,
[3016.48 --> 3017.54]  and he seems
[3017.54 --> 3018.38]  to even have
[3018.38 --> 3019.50]  bound himself
[3019.50 --> 3021.06]  to our prayers
[3021.06 --> 3022.14]  to respond to them.
[3024.00 --> 3024.80]  And so when we find
[3024.80 --> 3025.64]  ourselves in a time
[3025.64 --> 3026.20]  of testing,
[3026.34 --> 3027.08]  we're tempted to say,
[3027.14 --> 3028.32]  God, do you really love me?
[3029.32 --> 3031.20]  God, are you really good?
[3031.20 --> 3031.24]  God, are you good?
[3032.36 --> 3033.86]  We can pray for help.
[3034.96 --> 3035.98]  James goes on
[3035.98 --> 3037.06]  in the very next verse,
[3037.64 --> 3038.30]  in verse 8,
[3038.40 --> 3038.88]  to say,
[3039.76 --> 3041.66]  come near to God,
[3042.08 --> 3042.88]  and he will come
[3042.88 --> 3043.46]  near to you.
[3045.44 --> 3046.44]  But of course,
[3046.56 --> 3047.62]  we also resist evil
[3047.62 --> 3048.52]  in the evil one
[3048.52 --> 3049.34]  and temptation,
[3049.96 --> 3050.94]  not only through prayer,
[3051.80 --> 3053.08]  but by hating it
[3053.08 --> 3055.24]  and working against it.
[3055.24 --> 3057.60]  The Bible calls us
[3057.60 --> 3059.78]  to resist evil
[3059.78 --> 3061.28]  by hating it.
[3062.60 --> 3063.56]  In another one
[3063.56 --> 3064.92]  of C.S. Lewis' works,
[3065.02 --> 3066.02]  the Space Trilogy,
[3066.76 --> 3068.06]  one of the main characters,
[3068.16 --> 3069.18]  whose name is Ransom,
[3069.54 --> 3070.28]  meets Satan.
[3071.80 --> 3072.88]  And when Ransom
[3072.88 --> 3074.12]  meets Satan,
[3074.90 --> 3076.72]  he has this strong
[3076.72 --> 3078.72]  internal experience,
[3078.80 --> 3079.46]  this reaction,
[3080.12 --> 3081.14]  and he says
[3081.14 --> 3083.30]  it is a strong feeling
[3083.30 --> 3084.76]  of joy.
[3086.46 --> 3087.18]  Weird, right?
[3088.04 --> 3088.80]  It's kind of strange.
[3089.16 --> 3090.22]  Why would Ransom
[3090.22 --> 3091.26]  feel joy
[3091.26 --> 3093.22]  at meeting Satan?
[3094.28 --> 3095.50]  Here's what Lewis writes.
[3096.90 --> 3097.32]  And I'm going to,
[3097.32 --> 3097.92]  I put the whole,
[3098.08 --> 3098.66]  the quote up here
[3098.66 --> 3099.48]  so you can follow along.
[3102.48 --> 3103.80]  Then an experience
[3103.80 --> 3104.52]  that perhaps
[3104.52 --> 3105.54]  no good man
[3105.54 --> 3106.46]  can ever have
[3106.46 --> 3107.30]  in our world
[3107.30 --> 3108.72]  came over Ransom.
[3109.86 --> 3110.58]  A torrent
[3110.58 --> 3112.18]  of perfectly unmixed
[3112.18 --> 3113.06]  and lawful
[3113.06 --> 3113.82]  hatred
[3113.82 --> 3115.14]  came over him.
[3116.30 --> 3117.42]  It is perhaps
[3117.42 --> 3118.96]  difficult to understand
[3118.96 --> 3120.34]  why this feeling,
[3121.08 --> 3122.58]  why this filled Ransom,
[3122.64 --> 3123.46]  not with horror,
[3124.26 --> 3125.28]  but with a kind of joy.
[3126.86 --> 3127.92]  The joy came
[3127.92 --> 3129.52]  from finding at last
[3129.52 --> 3131.18]  what hatred
[3131.18 --> 3132.16]  is made for.
[3133.16 --> 3134.04]  As a boy
[3134.04 --> 3134.90]  with an axe
[3134.90 --> 3135.62]  rejoices
[3135.62 --> 3136.68]  at finding a tree,
[3137.62 --> 3138.22]  or a boy
[3138.22 --> 3138.80]  with a box
[3138.80 --> 3140.34]  of colored crayons
[3140.34 --> 3141.24]  rejoices
[3141.24 --> 3142.10]  on finding
[3142.10 --> 3142.86]  a pile
[3142.86 --> 3143.58]  of perfectly
[3143.58 --> 3144.30]  white paper,
[3145.30 --> 3146.52]  so he
[3146.52 --> 3147.56]  rejoiced
[3147.56 --> 3148.78]  in the perfect
[3148.78 --> 3149.68]  congruity
[3149.68 --> 3151.28]  between his emotion
[3151.28 --> 3152.84]  and his object.
[3155.60 --> 3157.68]  I love that passage.
[3158.96 --> 3160.48]  Hatred is made
[3160.48 --> 3161.64]  for evil.
[3161.64 --> 3161.68]  evil.
[3163.48 --> 3164.40]  What we're supposed
[3164.40 --> 3164.98]  to feel
[3164.98 --> 3165.58]  when we come
[3165.58 --> 3166.34]  across evil
[3166.34 --> 3167.44]  in our world,
[3167.82 --> 3168.36]  when we come
[3168.36 --> 3169.22]  across evil
[3169.22 --> 3169.88]  and sin
[3169.88 --> 3170.84]  in our own hearts,
[3171.68 --> 3172.98]  is a desire
[3172.98 --> 3174.48]  to despise it,
[3174.70 --> 3176.06]  to combat it,
[3176.26 --> 3177.34]  and to destroy it.
[3178.80 --> 3179.70]  And so when we pray
[3179.70 --> 3180.18]  that God would
[3180.18 --> 3180.78]  deliver us
[3180.78 --> 3181.16]  from evil,
[3181.24 --> 3182.18]  we're asking him
[3182.18 --> 3183.10]  to help us
[3183.10 --> 3184.10]  to hate
[3184.10 --> 3185.10]  that which
[3185.10 --> 3185.92]  he hates,
[3186.14 --> 3187.00]  which is sin
[3187.00 --> 3187.56]  and evil
[3187.56 --> 3188.52]  that is destroying
[3188.52 --> 3189.38]  us
[3189.38 --> 3190.08]  and his good
[3190.08 --> 3190.40]  world.
[3193.40 --> 3194.20]  We're asking
[3194.20 --> 3195.26]  him to produce
[3195.26 --> 3195.94]  in us
[3195.94 --> 3196.90]  a resistance,
[3198.16 --> 3199.08]  a resilience,
[3199.84 --> 3200.50]  a rebellion
[3200.50 --> 3201.76]  against evil,
[3202.32 --> 3203.24]  not just passively
[3203.24 --> 3203.60]  be like,
[3203.68 --> 3204.30]  oh, look,
[3204.36 --> 3204.98]  that's bad,
[3205.46 --> 3206.54]  but a desire
[3206.54 --> 3208.72]  to resist it
[3208.72 --> 3209.28]  and to rebel
[3209.28 --> 3209.90]  against it.
[3210.74 --> 3211.02]  Friends,
[3211.10 --> 3211.82]  we are recruited
[3211.82 --> 3212.64]  into God's
[3212.64 --> 3213.72]  cosmic resistance
[3213.72 --> 3215.18]  against evil
[3215.18 --> 3216.48]  when we pray
[3216.48 --> 3216.98]  this prayer.
[3218.78 --> 3219.48]  So God
[3219.48 --> 3220.24]  delivers us
[3220.24 --> 3220.58]  from evil
[3220.58 --> 3221.24]  by helping us
[3221.24 --> 3222.16]  to recognize it
[3222.16 --> 3223.54]  and to resist it,
[3223.86 --> 3224.50]  but thirdly,
[3224.56 --> 3225.60]  God delivers us
[3225.60 --> 3227.94]  simply by rescuing us.
[3229.18 --> 3229.88]  And really,
[3230.06 --> 3230.66]  this is probably
[3230.66 --> 3231.44]  the most important
[3231.44 --> 3232.04]  of the three,
[3232.42 --> 3233.24]  because to pray
[3233.24 --> 3234.10]  for deliverance
[3234.10 --> 3235.52]  means we are unable
[3235.52 --> 3236.54]  to deliver ourselves.
[3236.66 --> 3237.20]  That's what we're asking.
[3237.50 --> 3238.04]  Lord, help,
[3238.20 --> 3238.68]  rescue me,
[3239.00 --> 3239.60]  deliver me.
[3240.18 --> 3240.68]  And what we're
[3240.68 --> 3241.76]  acknowledging is that
[3241.76 --> 3242.76]  we can't deliver
[3242.76 --> 3243.38]  and rescue
[3243.38 --> 3244.48]  ourselves.
[3244.48 --> 3247.02]  And we just
[3247.02 --> 3248.02]  simply need to write
[3248.02 --> 3249.12]  Jesus help
[3249.12 --> 3250.46]  across the top
[3250.46 --> 3251.20]  of our lives.
[3252.46 --> 3253.34]  Jesus help.
[3253.44 --> 3254.26]  We don't have
[3254.26 --> 3255.10]  what it takes
[3255.10 --> 3255.64]  to overcome
[3255.64 --> 3256.36]  the evil
[3256.36 --> 3257.44]  that we see
[3257.44 --> 3258.42]  around us
[3258.42 --> 3260.68]  or the sin
[3260.68 --> 3261.54]  within us.
[3262.20 --> 3263.22]  We don't have
[3263.22 --> 3263.84]  the strength
[3263.84 --> 3264.46]  to overcome
[3264.46 --> 3265.22]  temptation.
[3266.42 --> 3267.22]  Jesus help.
[3268.42 --> 3269.12]  And that's what
[3269.12 --> 3269.52]  we pray
[3269.52 --> 3270.34]  in the face of evil.
[3270.44 --> 3271.12]  We ask that God
[3271.12 --> 3271.92]  would deliver us.
[3272.16 --> 3272.88]  And we know
[3272.88 --> 3274.10]  that God can deliver us
[3274.10 --> 3274.40]  and we know
[3274.40 --> 3274.72]  that God
[3274.72 --> 3275.76]  will deliver us
[3275.76 --> 3276.98]  because Jesus
[3276.98 --> 3278.26]  who taught us
[3278.26 --> 3279.06]  to pray this prayer
[3279.06 --> 3279.70]  is not only
[3279.70 --> 3280.40]  our teacher,
[3281.10 --> 3281.88]  he is
[3281.88 --> 3283.16]  our deliverer.
[3284.30 --> 3285.02]  Listen to what
[3285.02 --> 3286.38]  Hebrews 4.15
[3286.38 --> 3286.86]  says.
[3287.86 --> 3288.30]  It says,
[3288.44 --> 3288.92]  For we do not
[3288.92 --> 3289.88]  have a high priest
[3289.88 --> 3290.46]  who is unable
[3290.46 --> 3291.30]  to sympathize
[3291.30 --> 3291.96]  with our weaknesses,
[3292.30 --> 3293.22]  but we have one
[3293.22 --> 3293.68]  who has been
[3293.68 --> 3295.22]  tempted in every way
[3295.22 --> 3296.48]  just as we are
[3296.48 --> 3298.48]  yet did not sin.
[3299.88 --> 3301.04]  Thanks be to God.
[3301.56 --> 3302.46]  He did not sin.
[3302.46 --> 3305.10]  See,
[3305.20 --> 3305.90]  we will always
[3305.90 --> 3306.70]  be able to face
[3306.70 --> 3307.54]  up to the challenges
[3307.54 --> 3308.56]  and tests of life.
[3309.48 --> 3310.52]  We fall
[3310.52 --> 3311.36]  into temptation.
[3312.58 --> 3315.10]  We disobey God.
[3315.44 --> 3316.16]  We doubt
[3316.16 --> 3317.08]  his presence
[3317.08 --> 3317.68]  and his goodness.
[3318.12 --> 3318.64]  But Jesus
[3318.64 --> 3320.02]  never did.
[3321.08 --> 3322.14]  Jesus was always
[3322.14 --> 3323.12]  faithful to God.
[3323.60 --> 3325.22]  He always resisted
[3325.22 --> 3325.78]  the schemes
[3325.78 --> 3326.34]  of the devil.
[3326.66 --> 3327.86]  He never doubted
[3327.86 --> 3328.64]  for a moment
[3328.64 --> 3330.38]  God's care
[3330.38 --> 3332.22]  and his concern
[3332.22 --> 3332.66]  and goodness
[3332.66 --> 3333.10]  for him.
[3334.02 --> 3334.28]  Right?
[3334.38 --> 3334.72]  Remember,
[3334.84 --> 3335.46]  right at the beginning
[3335.46 --> 3336.58]  of Jesus' ministry,
[3336.98 --> 3337.86]  the Spirit of God
[3337.86 --> 3338.96]  led Jesus
[3338.96 --> 3340.14]  into a time
[3340.14 --> 3340.70]  of testing
[3340.70 --> 3341.66]  in the wilderness.
[3342.48 --> 3343.14]  And Jesus
[3343.14 --> 3343.70]  endured
[3343.70 --> 3344.86]  every temptation
[3344.86 --> 3345.78]  that the devil
[3345.78 --> 3346.52]  could throw at him.
[3347.52 --> 3347.96]  And then,
[3348.14 --> 3348.74]  at the end
[3348.74 --> 3349.52]  of his ministry,
[3349.90 --> 3351.16]  God led him
[3351.16 --> 3352.08]  into the Garden
[3352.08 --> 3352.90]  of Gethsemane.
[3353.78 --> 3354.44]  And Jesus
[3354.44 --> 3355.82]  makes this prayer,
[3355.92 --> 3356.80]  the sixth petition,
[3357.40 --> 3357.86]  personal.
[3358.72 --> 3359.04]  Father,
[3359.22 --> 3360.34]  lead me not
[3360.34 --> 3361.26]  into the time
[3361.26 --> 3361.68]  of testing,
[3361.76 --> 3362.50]  but deliver me
[3362.50 --> 3362.98]  from evil.
[3363.86 --> 3364.62]  It's a personal
[3364.62 --> 3365.22]  prayer now.
[3366.12 --> 3366.68]  And Jesus
[3366.68 --> 3367.46]  stood before
[3367.46 --> 3368.72]  the fiery furnace
[3368.72 --> 3370.08]  of the cross
[3370.08 --> 3370.98]  and he prayed
[3370.98 --> 3371.70]  to his Father,
[3372.08 --> 3372.76]  deliver me
[3372.76 --> 3373.30]  from evil.
[3374.66 --> 3375.50]  And what does
[3375.50 --> 3376.14]  the Father say?
[3377.20 --> 3378.24]  The Father says,
[3378.36 --> 3378.50]  no.
[3380.90 --> 3381.88]  Jesus prayed,
[3382.04 --> 3382.70]  lead me not
[3382.70 --> 3383.42]  into temptation,
[3383.76 --> 3384.56]  but deliver me
[3384.56 --> 3385.30]  from the evil one.
[3385.70 --> 3386.58]  And the Father says,
[3386.78 --> 3387.66]  no to Jesus
[3387.66 --> 3389.20]  so that he can say
[3389.20 --> 3390.22]  yes to us
[3390.22 --> 3391.44]  and so that he
[3391.44 --> 3392.24]  could deliver us.
[3393.78 --> 3394.78]  On the cross,
[3394.84 --> 3395.82]  even as the devil
[3395.82 --> 3396.68]  thought that he was
[3396.68 --> 3397.84]  getting the upper hand,
[3398.64 --> 3399.94]  Jesus was taking
[3399.94 --> 3401.06]  upon himself,
[3401.16 --> 3402.08]  onto his own body,
[3402.40 --> 3404.48]  the sins of the world,
[3404.54 --> 3405.86]  the evil of the world,
[3406.52 --> 3407.50]  and he was putting
[3407.50 --> 3408.24]  it to death.
[3409.78 --> 3410.62]  He was crushing
[3410.62 --> 3411.84]  the serpent's head
[3411.84 --> 3412.96]  dealing
[3412.96 --> 3414.62]  his final blow.
[3415.98 --> 3416.30]  And friends,
[3416.36 --> 3417.14]  that's the confidence
[3417.14 --> 3418.20]  now that we have
[3418.20 --> 3418.80]  to go to our
[3418.80 --> 3419.34]  Heavenly Father
[3419.34 --> 3419.74]  in prayer
[3419.74 --> 3420.78]  and to ask him
[3420.78 --> 3421.84]  to deliver us
[3421.84 --> 3422.82]  because
[3422.82 --> 3424.78]  Jesus is
[3424.78 --> 3426.06]  our deliverer.
[3427.12 --> 3428.06]  He will answer
[3428.06 --> 3428.68]  our prayer
[3428.68 --> 3429.32]  to deliver us
[3429.32 --> 3429.74]  from evil.
[3431.48 --> 3432.90]  I just want to finish
[3432.90 --> 3434.14]  with these words
[3434.14 --> 3435.86]  from the great hymn,
[3435.98 --> 3436.68]  A Mighty Fortress
[3436.68 --> 3437.34]  This is Our God
[3437.34 --> 3439.62]  by Martin Luther.
[3441.10 --> 3442.56]  And though this world
[3442.56 --> 3443.66]  with devils filled
[3443.66 --> 3444.50]  should threaten
[3444.50 --> 3445.34]  to undo us,
[3445.42 --> 3446.40]  we will not fear,
[3447.18 --> 3449.14]  for God has willed
[3449.14 --> 3450.30]  his truth
[3450.30 --> 3451.50]  to triumph
[3451.50 --> 3452.50]  through us.
[3453.50 --> 3455.14]  The prince of darkness
[3455.14 --> 3455.64]  grim,
[3455.96 --> 3457.24]  we tremble not for him.
[3458.00 --> 3458.74]  His rage
[3458.74 --> 3459.66]  we can endure,
[3460.10 --> 3460.56]  for lo,
[3460.70 --> 3461.56]  his doom is sure.
[3461.56 --> 3462.92]  and one little
[3462.92 --> 3463.94]  word
[3463.94 --> 3465.02]  shall
[3465.02 --> 3466.26]  tell him.
[3467.32 --> 3468.34]  Let's pray together.
[3474.40 --> 3474.96]  Jesus,
[3475.14 --> 3475.96]  our deliverer,
[3476.68 --> 3478.28]  we cry out to you
[3478.28 --> 3478.74]  for help.
[3478.74 --> 3481.46]  Lord,
[3481.56 --> 3483.16]  this world
[3483.16 --> 3484.96]  is still
[3484.96 --> 3485.90]  yet filled
[3485.90 --> 3486.50]  with evil,
[3487.34 --> 3488.38]  with sin,
[3488.80 --> 3490.24]  with the schemes
[3490.24 --> 3490.84]  of the devil
[3490.84 --> 3491.20]  who
[3491.20 --> 3493.42]  has been defeated
[3493.42 --> 3495.28]  but not yet
[3495.28 --> 3495.96]  finally
[3495.96 --> 3496.88]  destroyed.
[3497.48 --> 3498.14]  But we know
[3498.14 --> 3498.78]  one day
[3498.78 --> 3500.04]  we will never
[3500.04 --> 3500.68]  have to pray
[3500.68 --> 3501.18]  this prayer
[3501.18 --> 3502.04]  deliver us from evil
[3502.04 --> 3503.48]  because we will
[3503.48 --> 3504.68]  have been
[3504.68 --> 3505.38]  delivered
[3505.38 --> 3506.50]  fully and finally.
[3507.28 --> 3507.74]  Lord,
[3507.74 --> 3508.96]  we yearn for that day
[3508.96 --> 3509.90]  and in the meanwhile
[3509.90 --> 3511.12]  we thank you
[3511.12 --> 3512.12]  that you deliver us.
[3513.02 --> 3513.32]  Lord,
[3513.38 --> 3514.28]  would you deliver us,
[3514.42 --> 3515.16]  deliver this world
[3515.16 --> 3516.82]  and Lord,
[3516.96 --> 3517.70]  deliver this world
[3517.70 --> 3518.40]  through us
[3518.40 --> 3519.06]  as your spirit
[3519.06 --> 3519.92]  works within us
[3519.92 --> 3520.60]  and through us
[3520.60 --> 3522.30]  to be resistors
[3522.30 --> 3522.76]  of evil
[3522.76 --> 3524.36]  for the sake
[3524.36 --> 3524.92]  of your kingdom
[3524.92 --> 3525.54]  and your glory.
[3525.72 --> 3526.78]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3527.26 --> 3527.52]  Amen.
[3530.12 --> 3531.14]  Let's stand together
[3531.14 --> 3532.34]  and we will sing
[3532.34 --> 3533.74]  Good Shepherd of My Soul.
[3537.74 --> 3558.38]  Good Shepherd of My Soul,
[3558.38 --> 3562.10]  Come dwell within me.
[3562.10 --> 3564.34]  Take all I am
[3564.34 --> 3565.66]  and mold
[3565.66 --> 3568.98]  your likeness in me.
[3569.20 --> 3572.70]  Before the cross of Christ
[3572.70 --> 3576.26]  this is my sacrifice
[3576.26 --> 3578.62]  A life laid down
[3578.62 --> 3581.00]  and ready to follow
[3581.00 --> 3587.26]  The troubled find their peace
[3587.26 --> 3589.48]  In true surrender
[3589.48 --> 3594.22]  The prisoners there release
[3594.22 --> 3596.94]  From chains of anger
[3596.94 --> 3601.40]  In springs of living grace
[3601.40 --> 3605.08]  I find a resting place
[3605.08 --> 3607.40]  To rise refreshed
[3607.40 --> 3608.40]  determined
[3608.40 --> 3609.84]  To follow
[3609.84 --> 3616.26]  I'll walk this narrow road
[3616.26 --> 3619.34]  With Christ before me
[3619.34 --> 3623.24]  Where thorns and thistles grow
[3623.24 --> 3626.80]  And cords ensnare me
[3626.80 --> 3630.78]  Though doubted and denied
[3630.78 --> 3634.48]  He never leaves my side
[3634.48 --> 3636.96]  But lifts my head
[3636.96 --> 3639.38]  And calls me to follow
[3639.38 --> 3645.64]  And when my days are done
[3645.64 --> 3648.30]  My strength is failing
[3648.30 --> 3653.04]  He'll carry me alone
[3653.04 --> 3656.14]  Through death's unveiling
[3656.14 --> 3659.76]  Where struggles overcome
[3659.76 --> 3664.04]  Heaven's journey's just begun
[3664.04 --> 3666.52]  To search Christ's death
[3666.52 --> 3669.30]  And ever to follow
[3669.30 --> 3674.42]  To search Christ's death
[3674.42 --> 3677.52]  And ever to follow
[3677.52 --> 3689.98]  We will continue to worship
[3689.98 --> 3691.00]  The Lord this morning
[3691.00 --> 3692.80]  By giving of our tithes and offerings
[3692.80 --> 3695.28]  And maybe the deacons can come now
[3695.28 --> 3697.84]  And begin to pass the offering baskets
[3697.84 --> 3700.32]  So here's a reminder
[3700.32 --> 3701.66]  So here's a reminder from scripture
[3701.66 --> 3703.08]  It says
[3703.08 --> 3704.60]  Ascribe to the Lord the glory
[3704.60 --> 3705.46]  Due his name
[3705.46 --> 3707.00]  Bring an offering
[3707.00 --> 3708.38]  And come into his courts
[3708.38 --> 3709.78]  Worship the Lord
[3709.78 --> 3711.04]  In holy splendor
[3711.04 --> 3712.44]  Tremble before him
[3712.44 --> 3713.10]  All the earth
[3713.10 --> 3716.54]  So our offering today
[3716.54 --> 3717.78]  Our designated offering
[3717.78 --> 3719.76]  Is for Cascade Christian Counseling
[3719.76 --> 3721.10]  Which offers
[3721.10 --> 3722.16]  As it says here
[3722.16 --> 3723.64]  A caring faith-based approach
[3723.64 --> 3724.48]  To helping people
[3724.48 --> 3726.40]  Move towards healing
[3726.40 --> 3730.14]  From healing
[3730.14 --> 3733.38]  A think sekad
[3733.38 --> 3735.38]  Amen.
[3763.38 --> 3765.38]  Amen.
[3793.38 --> 3795.38]  Amen.
[3795.38 --> 3797.38]  Amen.
[3797.38 --> 3799.38]  Amen.
[3799.38 --> 3801.38]  Amen.
[3801.38 --> 3803.38]  Amen.
[3803.38 --> 3807.38]  Let's pray.
[3807.38 --> 3813.38]  God of all creation, through your goodness we have these gifts to share.
[3813.38 --> 3818.38]  Accept and use our offerings for your glory in the service of your kingdom.
[3818.38 --> 3821.38]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3821.38 --> 3827.38]  Friends, so now we come to a time that we call our community prayers,
[3827.38 --> 3829.38]  when we pray for the needs.
[3829.38 --> 3833.38]  We lift up our supplications, our intercessions on behalf of the world
[3833.38 --> 3835.38]  and the needs of the world.
[3835.38 --> 3842.38]  And, you know, many of our hearts are heavy this week with what is happening in Ukraine.
[3842.38 --> 3849.38]  And so I'm going to use a prayer written by a Resonate Global Mission missionary
[3849.38 --> 3855.38]  in the Ukraine, the Rev. George DeVoist, I think is how you say his name.
[3855.38 --> 3857.38]  And so he's written this prayer.
[3857.38 --> 3862.38]  And the churches of our denomination are all praying this prayer this Sunday.
[3862.38 --> 3868.38]  So we will join our voices with our brothers and sisters to pray for the people of Ukraine.
[3868.38 --> 3870.38]  Let's pray together.
[3870.38 --> 3882.38]  Heavenly Father, we come to you with heavy hearts as we see movements toward war in Ukraine.
[3882.38 --> 3888.38]  We pray that you would be merciful on the people of Ukraine and Russia and prevent this war.
[3888.38 --> 3892.38]  Grant wisdom to world leaders to effectively stop evil.
[3892.38 --> 3902.38]  Allow for the truth to be known, for lies to be shown for what they are, and for evildoers to be thwarted.
[3902.38 --> 3909.38]  Lord, we pray for those who have already lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods.
[3909.38 --> 3914.38]  Comfort and provide for the needs of those who have been displaced.
[3914.38 --> 3919.38]  Lord, we ask for mercy and we seek justice.
[3919.38 --> 3924.38]  We pray that you would be at work in both.
[3924.38 --> 3931.38]  We pray for the day when all wars will cease and when your peaceful reign will come fully.
[3931.38 --> 3938.38]  But in the meantime, we pray that you would use us to facilitate the coming of your kingdom here and now.
[3938.38 --> 3945.38]  Help us to take action to bring peace, to care for the victims of war, and to work for justice.
[3945.38 --> 3949.38]  Help us to live according to the principles of your kingdom today.
[3949.38 --> 3955.38]  And to remain faithful until your kingdom comes fully at your return.
[3955.38 --> 3963.38]  Grant courage to your church in Russia, in Ukraine, and here to speak truth to power.
[3963.38 --> 3971.38]  To prophetically proclaim the truths of your kingdom, as well as the day of grace that still remains for those who repent.
[3971.38 --> 3974.38]  Lord, we pray for President Putin.
[3974.38 --> 3981.38]  We pray that you would change his heart and work your miracle of salvation in his life.
[3981.38 --> 3990.38]  If he continues in his wicked ways, we pray that you would restrain his evil and have mercy on those who suffer because of it.
[3990.38 --> 3996.38]  Lord, we pray for the leaders of Ukraine, especially its president.
[3996.38 --> 4001.38]  We pray for your strength to resist evil.
[4001.38 --> 4007.38]  In all these things we trust you, Lord, because you are our loving Father.
[4007.38 --> 4014.38]  We ask that you would keep us faithful by the power of your spirit, and that you would be with your church in Ukraine.
[4014.38 --> 4022.38]  That in times of war, it would faithfully follow you and represent you before the nations.
[4022.38 --> 4038.38]  Reconcile the nations with you and with each other by the power of the cross of our reigning Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray.
[4038.38 --> 4039.38]  Amen.
[4039.38 --> 4040.38]  Amen.
[4040.38 --> 4049.38]  Let's stand now and we prepare to go out into the world resisting evil with our Father's blessing upon us.
[4049.38 --> 4057.26]  us. Please rise. I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the benediction. May the God of
[4057.26 --> 4063.50]  all grace who called us to his eternal glory in Christ after we have suffered a little while
[4063.50 --> 4072.60]  will himself restore us and make us strong, firm, and steadfast. To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.
[4079.38 --> 4107.06]  Be my God of Abraham. Lead me by your hand. You are strong and wise. I want to trust in you
[4107.06 --> 4122.40]  and in all I do bring you honor and praise. Be my God in the dark of night. Set a fear to flight. You are hope and truth.
[4123.76 --> 4132.42]  I want to trust in you and in all I do bring you honor and praise.
[4132.42 --> 4152.08]  Oh I love you. Great and mighty. You are faithful. Through the ages you never change.
[4152.08 --> 4174.90]  Be my God for the road ahead. Should I feel misled, you are just and good. I want to trust in you and in all I do bring you honor and praise.
[4174.90 --> 4194.12]  How I love you. Great and mighty. You are faithful. Through the ages you never change.
[4194.12 --> 4214.12]  How I love you. Great and mighty. You are faithful. Through the ages you never change.
[4224.12 --> 4229.12]  What you are faithful. Through the ages of Christ. Do you catch anything?
[4229.12 --> 4230.12]  I love you. He looks naprawdę. Through the ages you never change.
