[20.00 → 25.00] Size Kishore
[26.00 → 27.00] Kishore
[27.00 → 29.00] Amen.
[57.00 → 59.00] Amen.
[87.00 → 89.00] Amen.
[117.00 → 119.00] Amen.
[147.00 → 149.00] Amen.
[177.00 → 179.00] Amen.
[207.00 → 209.00] Amen.
[237.00 → 240.22] Good morning, everybody.
[240.76 → 242.64] It's nice to see you all here.
[243.20 → 245.96] What a wonderful day to sleep in an extra hour.
[247.24 → 251.06] For those who didn't notice that there was a times change,
[251.16 → 254.08] I hope you enjoyed the music team rehearsing at 9.15.
[255.44 → 257.74] We welcome you all who are here,
[257.74 → 261.02] and of course there are still quite a few coming in by streaming,
[261.18 → 263.66] and we welcome you this morning as well.
[264.12 → 266.70] If you are visiting our church in that manner,
[266.70 → 267.56] I'm John Smith.
[267.66 → 270.34] The rest of you folks here very likely know who I am.
[271.02 → 272.58] Stay for coffee if you're here,
[272.90 → 274.24] or other refreshments.
[274.34 → 276.06] There's tea and some juice and so forth.
[276.10 → 279.00] We'd like to get to know you if we've not met you before.
[281.98 → 285.48] Our guest pastor today is Pastor Walsh Brouwer.
[286.20 → 290.94] He's here because Pastor Jason is off doing a classist appointment
[290.94 → 293.40] at the bridge and preaching there this morning.
[293.98 → 295.66] Pastor Brouwer is currently retired.
[295.66 → 297.08] Well, sort of.
[297.16 → 298.08] He's here after all.
[299.06 → 301.30] And in a quick discussion with him this morning,
[301.38 → 303.70] I discovered how a retired person feels this week,
[303.90 → 305.38] and trust me, it's filled.
[306.02 → 309.32] He has served a variety of churches in the past in B.C. and Alberta,
[309.88 → 312.20] and most recently, or Alberta,
[313.08 → 318.32] he most recently had a pastoral role at Elam Village for several years
[318.32 → 320.36] until 2021.
[322.78 → 324.68] Today is World Hunger Sunday,
[324.88 → 326.82] and we're singing a variety of songs,
[326.94 → 327.68] taking a collection,
[327.82 → 333.30] and doing a number of things that emphasize that reality this morning.
[333.30 → 336.86] The world is still reeling from COVID-19.
[337.06 → 341.20] The conflict in Ukraine is causing considerable disruption in the food supply.
[341.78 → 343.12] You can see it on the daily news.
[343.20 → 348.34] For example, delivering grain supplies to North Africa from Crimea is disrupted by this war.
[348.72 → 350.36] Climate change is affecting the world.
[350.50 → 354.14] Worldwide food production is affected in unpredictable ways.
[354.14 → 359.62] Over 1.6 billion people face profound food insecurity.
[359.92 → 364.14] They are hungry today and will still be hungry tomorrow and next week.
[365.06 → 368.94] Marian Mandrel is our contact person for World Renew,
[369.42 → 373.74] under which the World Hunger Sunday is auspices.
[374.08 → 378.92] She has a number of things to say this morning about her role as contact person,
[379.28 → 381.18] and Marian can come up now.
[384.14 → 393.70] Good morning.
[394.54 → 395.94] Actually, I don't have a lot to say.
[396.60 → 397.12] Surprise.
[398.94 → 402.62] Just as John mentioned, it is World Hunger Sunday.
[402.80 → 406.86] Take note of the liturgy that we're using in connection to that and the songs.
[407.76 → 409.68] And also, during the offering this morning,
[409.96 → 413.98] we will have a video that will give you more information on what's going on
[413.98 → 416.12] with World Renew and what they're doing,
[416.80 → 419.94] helping people around the world, around the globe,
[420.18 → 424.96] and those that really depend on us for their daily sustenance.
[425.96 → 430.38] And often to start their own businesses, give them opportunities.
[430.38 → 436.80] So it's a wonderful thing to be involved and have the privilege of sharing what we have with them
[436.80 → 438.36] so that they can move forward as well.
[439.44 → 443.30] The other thing regarding World Renew, I'm called the champion,
[443.46 → 446.64] and as a champion, I'm afraid I have fallen down on the job a little bit.
[446.64 → 451.28] But you will notice you have gotten your catalogues for Christmas.
[451.46 → 457.32] I know it seems early, but it's fun just to maybe sit by the fire this afternoon in your living room or whatever
[457.32 → 464.94] and peruse and decide how you would like to share a gift with someone and what you'd like it to be.
[464.94 → 467.86] There are a lot of different possibilities here.
[468.00 → 472.44] So wherever your heart resonates, you can choose a gift to give.
[472.92 → 476.46] And just to let you know, we usually have, and I forgot to bring mine from home,
[476.52 → 481.34] but we have these lovely tags with these silk ribbons that I still have to put on the tags.
[481.82 → 484.40] So in the next few weeks, we'll have those available,
[484.40 → 488.26] and you can pick one according to the gift that you want to purchase,
[488.26 → 495.26] either from yourself or they make a lovely gift to put in a card to someone that's dear to you
[495.26 → 497.58] that you want to give a gift on behalf of.
[498.06 → 500.06] So you could put the tag in and say,
[500.22 → 505.90] I provided this gift for someone across the world on your behalf.
[506.48 → 511.06] And I was just thinking it might be a good way to show our grandkids
[511.06 → 516.82] how sharing is important for people, for us, with people around the world.
[516.82 → 520.26] So maybe you can get creative in that way as well.
[522.40 → 530.80] And my last announcement is that tonight we have a hymn sing.
[531.40 → 538.84] And I know many of you hold many of the faith-forming hymns that we've sung for years very dear.
[539.16 → 541.96] And so we're going to have a time of singing and scripture.
[542.44 → 543.52] Hope you can be here.
[545.02 → 546.76] You are the worship team.
[547.24 → 550.46] We don't have a worship team, but we have some musicians.
[550.46 → 552.18] Mel is going to be here on the organ.
[552.34 → 553.12] I'll be on piano.
[553.54 → 554.34] Henry on percussion.
[554.70 → 556.86] And Jim is coming with his violin.
[557.62 → 563.72] So they are going to help us sing these songs in between some scripture readings.
[564.14 → 565.60] So I hope you can be here.
[565.60 → 570.96] And if you are coming, and you think of someone that maybe feels challenged to come
[570.96 → 575.60] because of nighttime driving or because they don't have a ride, please keep that in mind
[575.60 → 578.86] and talk to them after the service or give somebody a call and say, would you like to go?
[579.38 → 579.62] Okay.
[579.86 → 580.72] Hope to see you.
[580.72 → 589.24] Mary Ann.
[589.24 → 591.12] Mary Ann may have mentioned it, but it missed the bulletin.
[591.12 → 593.32] That hymn sing is at 7 o'clock tonight.
[593.32 → 596.98] So not 7.30 standard Dutch time.
[597.18 → 597.50] Oops, sorry.
[597.50 → 608.40] Finally, World Renew is actually celebrating 60 years this year.
[608.72 → 615.30] For those of us like me, we've been calling it CRWRC for about 60 years,
[615.30 → 619.58] and it's the Christian Reform World Relief Committee now known as World Renew.
[620.90 → 621.66] Other announcements.
[622.02 → 626.82] Thursday morning, last Thursday morning, we had our opening again of this morning coffee time
[626.82 → 631.96] where all of us can get together, drink coffee, eat too many cookies and cake.
[632.52 → 635.04] And we had a huge crowd last week.
[635.44 → 637.22] It may have been as many as 20 people.
[638.00 → 639.92] It will probably settle down over time.
[639.92 → 644.20] But Thursday mornings at 10 o'clock, if you've got a few minutes or an hour,
[644.20 → 649.92] drop by, get a free cup of coffee, and see who else is there.
[651.58 → 656.08] The hospitality committee is organizing a soup and buns lunch next Sunday.
[656.20 → 656.98] That's in the bulletin.
[657.40 → 660.20] Sign up for what you're able to bring to that lunch.
[660.36 → 665.68] Not everyone needs to bring something, but if you are that person who always does,
[665.68 → 670.46] well, thank you in advance, and we look forward to trying out what you have prepared.
[670.62 → 672.70] That's next Sunday after the service.
[674.20 → 680.28] Our final announcement is from the deacons, reinforcing some things that are already written for you,
[680.34 → 684.42] and Elaine will come up and mention the issue of faith promise giving.
[684.42 → 693.40] Good morning.
[695.40 → 702.32] The deacons would like to make you aware that the faith promise giving pledge for 2023 is in your mailbox
[702.32 → 711.08] and can also be found as an attachment in the Connections Weekly Online newsletter, or it can be mailed to you.
[712.24 → 717.56] Please prayerfully reflect on what you can give in the coming year.
[717.56 → 724.20] The pledges will be collected in a special offering during our December 4th worship service.
[724.70 → 734.96] If you're not able to be here on December 4th, we would like to have all the forms either dropped off or mailed in by Wednesday, December 9.
[734.96 → 745.48] If you use PAR, pre-authorized remittance, you do not have to reenter your information on the form if there are no changes.
[746.18 → 751.52] Thank you for your contributions to and support of Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[751.94 → 752.44] Thank you.
[752.44 → 761.58] Well, that's it for announcements.
[761.82 → 764.06] If you can stand, please do so this morning.
[768.28 → 773.26] Our call to worship was inspired by 2 Timothy 1, verses 9 and 10.
[774.70 → 780.02] God has saved us and called us to a holy life, not because of anything we have done,
[780.02 → 783.36] but because of his own purpose and grace.
[783.88 → 786.68] This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus,
[787.00 → 793.40] who has destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light throughout the gospel.
[794.90 → 802.46] The Lord's greeting comes from the words of Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 1, verse 2.
[803.94 → 808.66] Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[808.66 → 815.06] I chose that because Pastor Broker is going to remind us of that later on in the text this morning.
[816.62 → 821.34] May I lead you in an opening prayer of adoration, asking for God's presence here this morning.
[821.76 → 822.58] Please pray with me.
[823.76 → 827.80] Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the earth and the universe.
[828.00 → 834.62] You have made all creation and made that work known to us so that we can worship and honour you.
[834.62 → 840.62] And that we do here today in this place, joining with Christians worldwide.
[841.42 → 845.14] As we prepare for worship, we pray that you will quiet our hearts,
[845.62 → 851.78] that we may hear your voice in your word and in the words of your servant, Pastor Broker.
[852.58 → 856.96] We pray that you will be glorified by the praise and prayers we offer to you.
[857.14 → 861.90] May our worship today be another step in offering our entire lives to you.
[861.90 → 869.40] We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Spirit is the only true God.
[869.80 → 870.24] Amen.
[872.58 → 875.98] Turn around and greet the person behind you and those around you.
[875.98 → 878.20] Walk the distance.
[878.32 → 880.02] Amen.
[882.12 → 883.18] Shed Wizards.
[883.36 → 887.12] And sit down and and his travels within Pi when meeting it is live from working for
[887.12 → 889.36] His suffering to return and his empowerment to encourage in the livingness steams to comfort
[889.64 → 891.24] and keep on Pole Kong.
[892.22 → 895.18] Let's say that to our Farewell 었 and J usher will be Ezra.
[898.06 → 904.42] Several
[904.42 → 934.40] Thank you.
[934.42 → 944.68] Faithful one, so unchanging.
[947.68 → 956.08] Ageless one, you're my rock of peace.
[956.08 → 963.36] Lord of all, I depend on you.
[964.42 → 973.34] I call out to you again and again.
[975.34 → 982.42] I call out to you again and again.
[982.42 → 991.72] You are my rock in times of trouble.
[991.72 → 1000.72] You lift me up when I fall down.
[1000.72 → 1013.24] All through the storm, your love is the anchor.
[1013.24 → 1021.48] My hope is in you alone.
[1021.48 → 1030.48] Faithful one, so unchanging.
[1030.48 → 1041.58] Ageless one, you're my rock of peace.
[1041.58 → 1048.58] Lord of all, I depend on you.
[1048.58 → 1058.58] I call out to you again and again.
[1058.58 → 1067.58] I call out to you again and again.
[1067.58 → 1076.58] You are my rock in times of trouble.
[1076.58 → 1085.58] You lift me up when I fall down.
[1085.58 → 1097.58] All through the storm, your love is the anchor.
[1097.58 → 1104.58] My hope is in you alone.
[1104.58 → 1105.22] You are my hots of arrows and family.
[1105.22 → 1116.56] You are my friends who lead me in you.
[1116.56 → 1118.76] Amount of all your dreams.
[1118.76 → 1140.94] Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee.
[1140.94 → 1155.06] Take my moments and my days, let them flow in endless praise.
[1157.20 → 1167.06] Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love.
[1167.06 → 1177.84] Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee.
[1178.16 → 1182.66] Swift and beautiful for thee.
[1184.02 → 1194.26] Take my voice and let me sing, always only for my King.
[1194.26 → 1204.32] Take my lips and let them be filled with messages from thee.
[1204.32 → 1209.94] Filled with messages from thee.
[1209.94 → 1222.94] My silver and my gold, not a mind could I withhold.
[1224.20 → 1233.94] Take my intellect and use every power as thou shalt choose.
[1233.94 → 1238.94] Every power as thou shalt choose.
[1238.94 → 1254.94] Take my love, my Lord, I pour.
[1255.90 → 1260.42] At thy feet is treasure stored.
[1260.42 → 1270.52] Take myself and I will be ever only, all for thee.
[1270.52 → 1276.34] Ever only, all for thee.
[1276.34 → 1306.32] Take my life and let them be.
[1306.32 → 1311.32] Let righteousness flow down, down like a river.
[1311.32 → 1316.38] Down to the valleys where the helpless pride.
[1316.38 → 1321.32] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1321.32 → 1327.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run out.
[1327.38 → 1341.38] Let righteousness flow down, down like a river.
[1341.38 → 1342.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1342.38 → 1343.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run.
[1343.38 → 1344.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1344.38 → 1345.38] Lead us to the home.
[1345.38 → 1346.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1346.38 → 1347.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1347.38 → 1351.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1351.38 → 1352.38] Down like a river.
[1352.38 → 1353.38] Down like a river down, down like a river.
[1353.38 → 1358.38] Down to the valleys where the helpless cry.
[1358.38 → 1359.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1359.38 → 1360.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1360.38 → 1361.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1361.38 → 1362.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run out.
[1362.38 → 1363.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1363.38 → 1364.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run out.
[1364.38 → 1365.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run out.
[1365.38 → 1370.38] Lead us to the stream that will never run out.
[1370.38 → 1375.38] Lead us to the streets of the homeless.
[1375.38 → 1380.38] Find in no place they can go.
[1380.38 → 1385.38] Lead us to the cells of the prisoners.
[1385.38 → 1387.38] Lead us to the streets of the homeless.
[1387.38 → 1390.38] Finding no place they can go.
[1390.38 → 1393.38] Lead us to the cells of the prisoners.
[1393.38 → 1395.38] And down like a river down.
[1395.38 → 1399.38] Down like a river down to the valleys where the helpless cry.
[1399.38 → 1405.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever.
[1405.38 → 1410.38] Lead us to the streams that will never run out.
[1410.38 → 1413.38] Go to the courts of the nation.
[1413.38 → 1416.38] Lead us in love to Christ.
[1416.38 → 1419.38] Lead us in love to Christ.
[1419.38 → 1421.38] Lead us in love to Christ.
[1421.38 → 1431.38] Lead us to the streams of salvation, fill our land with peace.
[1431.38 → 1441.38] Let justice flow down, down by the river, down to the valleys where the helpless thrive.
[1441.38 → 1454.38] Let righteousness flow through us forever. Lead us to the stream that will never run dry.
[1454.38 → 1474.38] In our time of confession and assurance, I've chosen a litany for World Hunger Sunday, and it's prepared by World Renew.
[1474.38 → 1485.38] While not purely confessional, there is a strong implication or confession that we can do more and think more about those less fortunate than us.
[1485.38 → 1492.38] This is a focus on food insecurity, hunger, and a striving for justice for those living with hunger and oppression.
[1492.38 → 1499.38] The scripture references will be up there, but will not be read aloud.
[1499.38 → 1508.38] Read with me in the usual manner that I read the first thing, and when you see the double arrows, you read yours.
[1508.38 → 1510.38] Let's begin.
[1510.38 → 1516.38] O Lord, what love you have lavished on us that we can call you ourselves your children.
[1516.38 → 1522.38] You have made us good, and you have invited us to join you in your good work.
[1522.38 → 1526.38] Today, may we listen to your words.
[1526.38 → 1535.38] May we come to deeply understand your heart for justice, and may we cultivate justice in the world around us.
[1535.38 → 1539.38] Jesus has taught us to offer living water to the thirsty.
[1539.38 → 1543.38] Jesus has shown us how to fill the hungry with good things.
[1543.38 → 1552.38] We desire to follow in the way of Jesus, doing your will and accomplishing your work.
[1552.38 → 1557.38] We desire to faithfully carry one another's burdens.
[1557.38 → 1561.38] Lord, we know the suffering of the world matters to you.
[1561.38 → 1570.38] Lord, we know the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering.
[1570.38 → 1572.38] From empty bellies to the evils of racism, your heart aches for those who experience ongoing harm and need.
[1572.38 → 1577.38] The psalmist says you collect each tear in a bottle and record it in your book.
[1577.38 → 1580.94] we will stand on these promises as a rock.
[1581.68 → 1583.82] Let your love flow through us
[1583.82 → 1586.22] and do immeasurably more
[1586.22 → 1589.18] than we can even ask or imagine.
[1590.34 → 1592.20] Let us share your love,
[1592.44 → 1593.92] not in words or speech,
[1594.22 → 1595.96] but in truth and action.
[1596.74 → 1598.30] Let us not withhold good
[1598.30 → 1600.90] when it is in our power to act.
[1601.94 → 1604.26] And to you, God of plenty,
[1605.04 → 1606.48] be glory in the church
[1606.48 → 1608.34] and in Christ Jesus
[1608.34 → 1610.76] throughout all generations
[1610.76 → 1612.82] forever and ever.
[1613.30 → 1613.90] Amen.
[1619.18 → 1623.06] Our assurance comes from selected verses
[1623.06 → 1624.52] of Psalm 103.
[1625.22 → 1627.48] Now, I know many of you like the cadence
[1627.48 → 1628.88] and poetry of 103.
[1628.88 → 1631.08] We learned that during Bart Vander's
[1631.08 → 1632.58] sessions on the Psalms.
[1632.96 → 1635.18] But I have picked several verses in here
[1635.18 → 1639.38] that really do focus on God's love for us,
[1639.50 → 1640.92] his desire for justice,
[1640.92 → 1642.62] and how we should honour him.
[1643.48 → 1647.34] Listen as I choose selected verses of Psalm 103.
[1647.34 → 1650.00] Praise the Lord, my soul,
[1650.16 → 1651.54] in my inmost being.
[1651.66 → 1652.96] Praise his holy name.
[1654.02 → 1655.38] Praise the Lord, my soul,
[1655.44 → 1657.40] and forget not all his benefits.
[1657.94 → 1660.00] Who forgives all your sins
[1660.00 → 1662.14] and heals all your diseases?
[1662.14 → 1665.86] The Lord works righteousness and justice
[1665.86 → 1666.82] for all the oppressed.
[1666.98 → 1669.48] He does not treat us as our sins deserve.
[1670.10 → 1672.80] For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[1673.12 → 1675.92] so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1676.68 → 1678.96] The Lord has established his throne in heaven,
[1679.30 → 1681.82] and his kingdom rules over all.
[1682.80 → 1683.64] Praise the Lord,
[1683.76 → 1685.42] all his heavenly hosts,
[1685.66 → 1686.66] you his servants,
[1687.14 → 1688.12] who do his will.
[1688.68 → 1690.40] Praise the Lord, my soul.
[1690.40 → 1697.46] Let's sing another song after this assurance.
[1697.60 → 1699.76] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[1699.76 → 1728.78] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[1728.78 → 1729.78] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[1729.78 → 1731.60] We will feast in the house of Zion.
[1731.60 → 1734.24] With our hearts restored.
[1734.50 → 1736.88] He has done great things.
[1736.98 → 1739.74] We will say together.
[1740.20 → 1745.36] We will feast and weep no more.
[1745.36 → 1746.36] We will feast and weep no more.
[1746.36 → 1747.36] Lord, we will feast and weep no more.
[1747.36 → 1748.36] We will feast and weep no more.
[1748.36 → 1749.02] We will feast and weep no more.
[1749.02 → 1753.68] We will not be burned by the flood.
[1753.68 → 1759.14] He is the Lord our God.
[1759.14 → 1771.68] We are not consumed by the flow, upheld, protected, gathered.
[1771.68 → 1782.64] We will feast in the house of sorrow, we will sing with our hearts restored.
[1782.64 → 1794.52] He has done great things, we will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[1795.74 → 1811.32] In the dark of night, before the dawn, my soul be not afraid, for the promised holy go home.
[1812.64 → 1819.80] O God of Jacob, be my strength.
[1820.46 → 1830.58] We will feast in the house of Zion, we will sing with our hearts restored.
[1830.58 → 1842.58] He has done great things, we will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[1842.64 → 1849.52] Every vow we've broken and betrayed.
[1849.52 → 1859.52] You are the faithful one, and from the garden to the grave.
[1861.12 → 1865.60] Find us together, bring joy.
[1865.60 → 1878.40] We will feast in the house of Zion, we will sing with our hearts restored.
[1878.40 → 1890.40] He has done great things, we will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[1890.40 → 1907.14] As best I understand it, the children are now dismissed ages 3 to grade 5.
[1907.28 → 1910.58] They're dismissed for kids' life and you folks can leave now.
[1910.58 → 1913.50] Must be right, they're thundering out of here.
[1913.50 → 1920.44] At this moment, I will welcome Pastor Walt Broker up, and he will hold forth this morning.
[1921.46 → 1922.38] Lord's blessing.
[1922.38 → 1938.52] Thank you for the invitation to fill your pulpit this morning.
[1938.52 → 1949.18] And I must say that it's been a long time since I've been in a congregation that sang so well.
[1949.18 → 1953.16] You have wonderful congregational singing.
[1953.16 → 1968.84] I, you know, in many churches, including my own, there's so much music from the band that it really drowns out the voices, which I think is, they want to be critical, but I think it's unfortunate.
[1968.84 → 1974.30] It's wonderful to sing with you here.
[1974.30 → 1980.92] I'd like to unwrap for you really one verse this morning, but I want to read scripture in context.
[1980.92 → 1984.08] I just want to say a few things to help us understand the scriptures.
[1984.88 → 1991.80] The scripture I want to read is 2 Corinthians 1, verses 1 to 11.
[1991.80 → 1999.72] And you might know how Paul established the church in Corinth.
[1999.96 → 2003.62] He spends a year and a half there, as it says in Acts 18.
[2004.64 → 2009.44] And he wrote the letter about 22 years after the resurrection, about the year 55.
[2009.82 → 2014.56] And in this letter, more than anywhere else, Paul is most vulnerable.
[2014.56 → 2024.80] He reveals more about his heartaches, his challenges, both emotional and spiritual, than he does anywhere else.
[2025.78 → 2039.76] And so when Paul starts his letter, he doesn't talk about his accomplishments, how many churches he planted, the travels that he went through, the number of people that he perhaps led to Christ.
[2039.76 → 2049.00] Instead, he begins his letter with an admission of his deep need for the comfort of God.
[2050.62 → 2053.40] Comfort is a major theme in this book.
[2053.48 → 2055.24] It occurs 29 times.
[2055.74 → 2062.84] In the first 11 verses, in fact, in verses 3 to 7, the word comfort occurs 11 times.
[2062.84 → 2071.86] And I'd like you to notice those times when that word is used and also the vulnerability with which Paul speaks.
[2073.06 → 2074.50] So here's the scripture.
[2074.72 → 2075.42] Do we have it up?
[2075.42 → 2075.44] Do we have it up?
[2075.44 → 2093.82] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout Achaea, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2093.82 → 2110.56] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
[2111.54 → 2117.88] For just as we share in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
[2117.88 → 2121.98] If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation.
[2122.22 → 2129.90] If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in your patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
[2130.46 → 2138.62] And our hope for you is firm because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
[2139.74 → 2145.74] We do not want you to be an informed brothers and sisters about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia.
[2145.74 → 2151.62] We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure.
[2152.14 → 2155.52] Now notice what it says, we even despaired of life.
[2158.78 → 2162.22] Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death.
[2162.32 → 2169.66] But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves, but on God, who raises the dead.
[2169.66 → 2175.44] He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again.
[2176.00 → 2180.32] On him, we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us.
[2180.58 → 2191.30] As you help us by your prayers, then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favour granted us in the answer to the prayers of many.
[2191.70 → 2192.54] Let's pray together.
[2192.54 → 2199.08] Heavenly Father, may the words of my mouth and meditation of my heart be pleasing to you.
[2199.84 → 2203.32] O God, our rock and redeemer, through Christ our Lord.
[2203.56 → 2203.92] Amen.
[2208.26 → 2218.24] You know, we have gathered here in this worship space, this sanctuary, because that is what we do.
[2218.36 → 2219.46] We worship here.
[2219.46 → 2223.18] And the question is, why do we worship God?
[2223.26 → 2234.86] In fact, it might be a good exercise for you, maybe on a quiet moment this afternoon, or if you're in a small group, Bible study group, to think of all the reasons you worship God.
[2235.32 → 2240.68] And if you would do that, and again, I would encourage you to do that, to think of two ways in worship God.
[2240.88 → 2247.16] We worship God for who he is, and we worship God for what he does.
[2247.16 → 2257.18] And again, just take a few moments, some reflective prayerful moments, and think of all the ways in which you worship God for who he is, and what he does.
[2257.26 → 2262.22] Here's what it says in Revelation, where there's a lot of worship happening.
[2262.64 → 2268.50] Praise, and glory, and wisdom, and thanks, and honour, and power, and strength.
[2268.96 → 2271.42] Be to our God forever and ever.
[2271.60 → 2271.92] Amen.
[2271.92 → 2272.12] Amen.
[2272.12 → 2272.16] Amen.
[2277.16 → 2290.92] And when Paul begins his second letter to Corinthians, and he's thinking of a reason for which he ought to praise God,
[2291.92 → 2298.58] he thinks of the comfort God provides.
[2299.76 → 2303.88] Notice the scripture, the next one, please.
[2303.88 → 2306.82] Here's what he says.
[2306.82 → 2314.16] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of all compassion, and the God of all comfort,
[2314.34 → 2322.12] who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the same comfort we receive from God.
[2325.48 → 2332.74] One important reason we worship, folks, is because God is a God of comfort.
[2333.88 → 2335.54] I mean, think about it.
[2335.58 → 2341.96] Don't you agree that if there's one need, and there are many needs we all have, but certainly among the needs that we have,
[2342.62 → 2347.38] don't you agree we have all a need for comfort as we go through life?
[2350.08 → 2356.60] Let's be sure that we live in a remarkable time in history and a remarkable place here in Canada,
[2356.60 → 2360.38] where our lives are incredibly comfortable.
[2360.38 → 2368.38] The kings and queens of yesteryear would have loved to trade their comforts with our comforts today.
[2369.32 → 2375.24] And just think of modern dentistry, painkillers, and flushing toilets.
[2375.24 → 2381.34] It goes on and on and on and on, warm, instant hot water, warm homes instantly.
[2382.64 → 2384.60] And yet our lives, too, aren't they?
[2384.96 → 2388.84] Are filled with difficulty and stress through the years.
[2388.84 → 2395.86] You know, I'll never forget something that just blew me away.
[2395.86 → 2403.94] About 10 years ago, my son, who had just graduated from the King's University in Edmonton, a great school, by the way.
[2405.74 → 2411.08] Yeah, I really highly encourage young people to attend the King's University.
[2411.08 → 2418.24] He had graduated, and he said, Dan, do you still have your Dutch citizenship?
[2419.48 → 2425.54] I finished high school in the Netherlands, and so I became a Canadian by choice,
[2425.64 → 2430.14] and so I had to give up my Dutch citizenship, and I told him that.
[2430.22 → 2430.74] I said, why?
[2430.90 → 2436.72] Well, he wanted to do graduate work in the European Union,
[2436.72 → 2441.10] and he found a school that was really attractive to him,
[2441.12 → 2445.22] and he said, you know, if you are still Dutch or have a Dutch passport,
[2445.64 → 2450.04] then I can get to the EU really cheap and study really cheap.
[2450.70 → 2455.26] If I cannot have a Dutch passport, then it's going to be really expensive.
[2456.48 → 2460.94] And so, well, I'll look into it, and eventually he went to graduate school in Ottawa,
[2461.10 → 2464.50] but I initially looked into it, and in order to do that,
[2464.50 → 2468.98] I got in touch with the Dutch consulate in Vancouver,
[2469.20 → 2472.04] and they asked me to fill out a number of forms, including,
[2473.04 → 2478.68] they asked me to trace my ancestry back three generations.
[2479.34 → 2484.18] So my parents, my grandparents, and their parents.
[2485.86 → 2491.60] Now, I had a wonderful relationship with my father's mother.
[2491.60 → 2496.14] I lived in the same town, even from a child as a toddler.
[2496.40 → 2497.88] I remember walking.
[2498.48 → 2499.94] We don't allow kids to do that anymore,
[2500.10 → 2504.18] but I walked three blocks to her house to play Lego, very primitive Lego.
[2506.24 → 2509.94] And we'd have at the church, we'd have a big dinner there,
[2510.02 → 2513.00] and as a teenager, I loved visiting here once a week.
[2513.08 → 2514.60] We had a wonderful relationship,
[2514.60 → 2520.08] unlike her husband who was involved in the underground during the war.
[2520.18 → 2520.84] He was imprisoned.
[2520.98 → 2524.32] He was starved, beaten, and he came back a broken man.
[2524.70 → 2527.86] He was emotionally unavailable, but not his wife.
[2527.86 → 2536.88] And so when I did some research on her family,
[2536.88 → 2539.54] I found something that she never talked to me about.
[2539.78 → 2540.84] She had three sisters.
[2543.20 → 2544.96] One died at age 19.
[2545.84 → 2548.56] Another died at age 21.
[2548.56 → 2552.52] And a third died at age 24.
[2553.68 → 2555.36] And I never knew this.
[2556.26 → 2558.18] She never talked to me about them.
[2558.62 → 2560.52] This did happen about 100 years ago.
[2560.84 → 2564.48] She was born in 1897.
[2566.06 → 2570.22] And so I reached out to my family to see if they had any answers,
[2570.32 → 2573.24] and it appears that the 19, the 21-year-old died of TB.
[2574.06 → 2577.30] Nobody knew what the 24-year-old died of.
[2578.24 → 2579.42] But she was married.
[2580.94 → 2584.66] And I'm sure, we cannot be sure,
[2584.66 → 2588.24] but my guess is that she died in childbirth.
[2591.02 → 2593.90] Today, we take it for granted
[2593.90 → 2596.84] that that's not an issue for us anymore.
[2597.04 → 2599.50] In fact, if it wasn't for Cesarean sections,
[2599.62 → 2601.66] I would have been widowed 36 years ago.
[2603.24 → 2607.58] I can only, I can't even imagine
[2607.58 → 2610.96] what my grandmother's parents went through
[2610.96 → 2617.16] when they lost three daughters,
[2617.66 → 2619.84] or what my grandmother went through.
[2622.94 → 2624.16] But they were Christians.
[2624.16 → 2626.88] And I'm sure they heard,
[2627.82 → 2629.94] praise be to the God and Father
[2629.94 → 2633.14] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2633.22 → 2636.84] the Father of all compassion
[2636.84 → 2638.38] and the God of all comfort.
[2642.70 → 2645.74] You know, back in the 80s,
[2645.74 → 2646.94] when I started ministry
[2646.94 → 2648.74] in the Christian Forum Church,
[2648.74 → 2650.94] pretty well,
[2651.04 → 2653.98] all churches had evening service.
[2654.90 → 2656.90] And the evening service was devoted
[2656.90 → 2658.68] as a teaching service,
[2659.10 → 2660.96] and we preachers were expected
[2660.96 → 2662.40] to expound the scriptures
[2662.40 → 2664.48] through the Crees and confessions.
[2664.62 → 2665.66] And so I did too,
[2666.04 → 2667.30] and especially the Hyde of the Catechism.
[2667.38 → 2669.68] And I remember coming to the Hyde of the Catechism,
[2669.84 → 2670.66] Lord's Day One.
[2670.74 → 2673.30] What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[2673.30 → 2675.66] And I looked at that,
[2676.38 → 2677.44] and I said to myself,
[2677.58 → 2679.56] well, if I wrote the Catechism
[2679.56 → 2681.16] as a young preacher,
[2681.94 → 2683.46] I wouldn't ask,
[2683.58 → 2685.80] what is your only comfort in life and in death?
[2686.08 → 2687.40] I would ask,
[2687.54 → 2691.08] what is your only joy in life and in death?
[2692.16 → 2693.76] And theologically and biblically,
[2693.86 → 2694.72] this is defensible,
[2695.32 → 2697.92] but I totally forgot the day
[2697.92 → 2700.14] in which the Catechism was written.
[2700.84 → 2702.26] Life was brutal.
[2702.26 → 2704.62] Even up to 100 years ago,
[2705.06 → 2706.78] life expectancy for men
[2706.78 → 2708.50] was about 37 years,
[2708.82 → 2710.14] for women about the same.
[2711.14 → 2712.16] Life was brutal.
[2712.74 → 2714.80] And so it is no surprise at all
[2714.80 → 2717.80] that the Catechism should start,
[2717.94 → 2721.98] what is your only comfort in life and in death?
[2722.08 → 2723.16] And the answer, of course,
[2723.22 → 2725.68] is that we belong to our faithful Saviour,
[2725.84 → 2726.52] Jesus Christ.
[2727.06 → 2729.52] In my years of pastoral ministry,
[2729.52 → 2732.24] and I first started ministry 40 years ago,
[2733.04 → 2737.48] I discovered that every home has a hidden hurt.
[2738.92 → 2740.46] Every home has a hidden hurt.
[2740.90 → 2741.90] We come to church,
[2742.00 → 2743.96] and maybe we don't dress up the way we used to,
[2744.38 → 2746.38] but at least in our posture,
[2746.52 → 2747.18] in our attitude,
[2747.32 → 2749.38] we dress up.
[2749.72 → 2751.36] But it wouldn't be difficult for me
[2751.36 → 2754.08] to ask you some pastoral questions
[2754.08 → 2755.62] to hear you, too,
[2755.72 → 2757.32] admit that there is a hidden hurt
[2757.32 → 2759.32] somewhere in your family.
[2763.88 → 2766.88] Do you know of the most successful series of books
[2766.88 → 2768.44] ever published in history?
[2768.44 → 2773.26] It's called the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.
[2774.04 → 2774.80] Have you heard of that?
[2775.90 → 2776.34] Sure.
[2776.84 → 2778.64] I'm sure most of us have.
[2779.36 → 2780.80] Back in 1993,
[2781.10 → 2783.10] when Mark Hanson and Jack Canfield
[2783.10 → 2788.10] decided to collect 101 encouraging stories
[2788.10 → 2789.88] for publication,
[2790.08 → 2792.08] they had no idea what they started.
[2792.50 → 2794.66] They thought they'd just published a single volume,
[2794.66 → 2797.94] and it went right to the number one spot
[2797.94 → 2799.74] in the New York Times bestsellers list,
[2799.94 → 2800.42] and he said,
[2800.50 → 2801.78] I think we're on to something.
[2803.56 → 2806.38] And so they began to add another title
[2806.38 → 2807.24] and another one.
[2807.34 → 2809.58] There's over 200 titles
[2809.58 → 2813.12] in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.
[2814.40 → 2818.46] They're translated in 54 different languages
[2818.46 → 2822.54] in 117 different countries.
[2822.54 → 2827.80] It is by far the most successful series of books
[2827.80 → 2828.96] in publishing history,
[2829.06 → 2830.06] but here's my point.
[2831.94 → 2833.44] What is chicken soup?
[2835.24 → 2839.18] Is chicken soup just not a phrase for comfort
[2839.18 → 2841.06] and encouragement?
[2842.44 → 2845.14] The success of this series of books
[2845.14 → 2850.70] is simply an expression of the need
[2850.70 → 2853.48] that people have for encouragement
[2853.48 → 2855.02] and for comfort.
[2857.86 → 2858.84] And Paul says,
[2858.96 → 2860.68] Praise be to the God and Father
[2860.68 → 2861.78] of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2861.86 → 2862.94] the God of all comfort.
[2863.06 → 2864.34] And I want you to notice something
[2864.34 → 2866.64] that is really remarkable.
[2868.10 → 2869.62] John 14, 16.
[2869.74 → 2870.62] Can we have that?
[2871.88 → 2873.24] Here's what Jesus says.
[2873.24 → 2874.10] Jesus says,
[2874.58 → 2876.12] I will ask the Father.
[2876.24 → 2877.26] This is in the upper room.
[2878.16 → 2879.36] I will ask the Father,
[2880.16 → 2883.40] and He shall give you another comforter.
[2884.00 → 2885.76] The word comforter is the same word
[2885.76 → 2888.76] that Paul uses in 2 Corinthians 1, verse 3.
[2889.44 → 2891.40] And here's what I want us to note.
[2892.74 → 2894.64] If we look at this verse
[2894.64 → 2897.74] through the prism of the Trinity,
[2897.74 → 2900.74] then who is Jesus in the Trinity?
[2900.92 → 2901.56] Which person?
[2903.10 → 2904.64] The second person, right?
[2905.12 → 2905.94] So He says,
[2906.38 → 2908.16] I will ask the Father who is what?
[2908.36 → 2909.34] The first person.
[2910.18 → 2911.76] And who is Jesus referring to
[2911.76 → 2914.44] when He's referring to another comforter?
[2914.62 → 2915.24] You tell me.
[2916.22 → 2917.12] The Holy Spirit.
[2918.12 → 2919.70] So, get this.
[2921.26 → 2923.06] Jesus, the second person of the Trinity,
[2923.20 → 2924.80] asked the first person of the Trinity
[2924.80 → 2926.98] that He will send the Holy Spirit,
[2927.56 → 2928.70] the third person of the Trinity,
[2929.06 → 2930.60] as a comforter.
[2932.12 → 2935.06] The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
[2935.06 → 2939.26] are all involved in a comforting ministry
[2939.26 → 2940.58] to believers.
[2940.98 → 2943.84] And to me, that is a wow verse.
[2945.50 → 2948.86] You see, what sets you and me apart as believers?
[2948.86 → 2951.74] One of the big things on this side of eternity
[2951.74 → 2954.84] is that we have a God who comforts us,
[2955.62 → 2958.04] who comes alongside of us.
[2959.96 → 2961.96] My wife and I both retired.
[2962.86 → 2966.92] Last year, she retired after 40 years of family medicine.
[2967.84 → 2968.74] And two weeks ago,
[2969.38 → 2971.08] one of her colleagues at the clinic
[2971.08 → 2973.72] where she works in Fort Langley,
[2973.72 → 2974.56] where we live,
[2975.84 → 2977.48] lost a 20...
[2977.48 → 2981.16] His 29-year-old son
[2981.16 → 2983.48] in a single motor vehicle accident
[2983.48 → 2984.70] on the Coquihalla Highway.
[2985.66 → 2991.92] He had slipped on some black ice,
[2992.62 → 2994.12] went across the median,
[2994.32 → 2995.40] and hit a truck.
[2995.40 → 3000.90] This man is a Christian.
[3002.58 → 3007.20] And he wrote to his friends and colleagues,
[3007.34 → 3008.18] Christian colleagues,
[3009.12 → 3010.74] about what had happened.
[3012.00 → 3015.50] And he mentions how he draws upon
[3015.50 → 3019.70] the presence and the comfort of God.
[3019.70 → 3023.66] And then he also wrote
[3023.66 → 3027.36] a communication to his colleagues.
[3028.54 → 3029.74] And I saw that one, too.
[3030.84 → 3037.08] And he doesn't expressly talk about divine comfort,
[3037.46 → 3037.98] but he said,
[3038.46 → 3040.10] I want you to know
[3040.10 → 3043.52] we are okay.
[3043.52 → 3043.64] Okay.
[3049.70 → 3053.76] And I wonder that those who read that
[3053.76 → 3057.66] and who don't know that he's a Christian,
[3059.32 → 3060.52] how they reconcile
[3060.52 → 3063.30] the loss of a 29-year-old son
[3063.30 → 3064.94] and saying we're okay.
[3065.38 → 3066.90] It doesn't make any sense.
[3067.74 → 3069.04] Unless you know
[3069.04 → 3070.70] that he's a sincere,
[3071.12 → 3072.30] wholehearted believer
[3072.30 → 3074.46] and the God of all comfort.
[3074.46 → 3080.22] Now, I want us to notice
[3080.22 → 3082.02] two things,
[3082.18 → 3084.02] what the Apostle Paul says
[3084.02 → 3085.30] about God's comfort.
[3085.48 → 3086.66] And I want to unwrap this
[3086.66 → 3088.28] really briefly for you.
[3088.34 → 3088.64] First,
[3089.44 → 3092.40] Paul talks about God's comfort to us,
[3092.84 → 3094.92] and then he talks about God's comfort
[3094.92 → 3095.90] through us.
[3096.18 → 3096.40] Okay?
[3096.76 → 3098.30] So that's what I want to look at.
[3098.30 → 3100.22] So let's look at how God's comfort
[3100.22 → 3102.28] comes to us.
[3102.28 → 3107.04] Can we have the next slide, please?
[3107.94 → 3108.90] The next one.
[3110.28 → 3110.68] All right.
[3110.78 → 3111.76] So here, again,
[3112.00 → 3113.64] praise be to the God and Father
[3113.64 → 3115.02] of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3115.24 → 3116.88] the God of all comfort,
[3117.02 → 3118.00] who comforts us
[3118.00 → 3119.08] in all our troubles.
[3119.20 → 3120.26] I want you to notice
[3120.26 → 3121.38] the two times
[3121.38 → 3123.02] the word all occurs here.
[3123.16 → 3123.78] First,
[3124.22 → 3126.26] it's the God of all comfort.
[3127.86 → 3128.62] So in other words,
[3128.82 → 3130.50] Paul says that
[3130.50 → 3133.60] that all comfort
[3133.60 → 3135.64] that truly restores the soul
[3135.64 → 3136.90] finds its origin
[3136.90 → 3138.42] in the divine being
[3138.42 → 3139.84] who wants us
[3139.84 → 3141.28] to be encouraged
[3141.28 → 3142.64] and comforted
[3142.64 → 3144.30] in the face
[3144.30 → 3145.64] of life's adversities.
[3149.34 → 3150.28] And then,
[3150.80 → 3151.42] Paul says,
[3151.50 → 3152.24] he's the God
[3152.24 → 3154.28] who comforts us
[3154.28 → 3155.50] in all our troubles.
[3155.50 → 3156.50] In other words,
[3156.80 → 3157.56] Paul says that
[3157.56 → 3159.26] there is no pain
[3159.26 → 3160.16] or setback
[3160.16 → 3160.94] we go through,
[3161.32 → 3162.30] no matter how
[3162.30 → 3163.70] heartrending or deep,
[3163.78 → 3164.68] that is beyond
[3164.68 → 3165.62] God's ability
[3165.62 → 3166.84] through the Holy Spirit
[3166.84 → 3168.86] to reach out to us
[3168.86 → 3170.68] in order to help us.
[3172.46 → 3173.22] You know,
[3173.32 → 3174.04] there's some people
[3174.04 → 3174.96] have a composite picture
[3174.96 → 3176.44] of God as a heartless boss
[3176.44 → 3177.42] or a judgmental,
[3177.50 → 3178.30] conniving man
[3178.30 → 3179.30] with a short fuse,
[3179.38 → 3180.58] and Paul blows that away.
[3180.58 → 3180.98] No.
[3182.78 → 3183.86] Our God and Father
[3183.86 → 3185.02] is a gracious God
[3185.02 → 3185.54] who is a God
[3185.54 → 3186.30] of all comfort
[3186.30 → 3187.14] who comforts us
[3187.14 → 3188.18] in all our troubles.
[3192.28 → 3193.28] So the question is,
[3193.36 → 3194.60] how does God do that?
[3194.96 → 3196.98] How does God manifest
[3196.98 → 3199.10] his comforting promise
[3199.10 → 3199.74] to us?
[3199.78 → 3200.52] And I will offer you
[3200.52 → 3201.46] these insights.
[3202.22 → 3202.74] First,
[3203.30 → 3204.18] God wants us
[3204.18 → 3205.10] to know him
[3205.10 → 3207.40] in our grief
[3207.40 → 3208.36] and our pain.
[3210.32 → 3211.52] Notice those verses
[3211.52 → 3213.22] again from the same letter,
[3213.38 → 3214.62] 2 Corinthians 4,
[3214.72 → 3215.40] 8 and 9.
[3216.04 → 3216.72] We are pressed
[3216.72 → 3217.54] on every side
[3217.54 → 3218.14] by troubles
[3218.14 → 3218.78] but we are not
[3218.78 → 3219.72] crushed and broken.
[3220.24 → 3221.40] We are perplexed
[3221.40 → 3222.34] but we don't give up
[3222.34 → 3222.84] and quit.
[3223.24 → 3224.24] We are hunted down
[3224.24 → 3225.46] but God never
[3225.46 → 3226.44] abandons us.
[3226.52 → 3227.52] We got knocked down
[3227.52 → 3228.46] but we got up again
[3228.46 → 3229.30] and keep going.
[3229.90 → 3230.84] It is an amazing
[3230.84 → 3232.18] admission of Paul.
[3232.32 → 3232.66] He says,
[3232.66 → 3233.76] we were crushed
[3233.76 → 3234.40] and broken.
[3234.78 → 3235.88] You read other passages
[3235.88 → 3237.14] in particularly
[3237.14 → 3237.80] this letter
[3237.80 → 3238.56] and Paul admits
[3238.56 → 3238.90] that he,
[3239.38 → 3240.28] in today's words
[3240.28 → 3240.54] says,
[3240.64 → 3241.52] I was depressed.
[3242.66 → 3243.26] But he says,
[3243.34 → 3244.34] I never give up
[3244.34 → 3245.18] and here's the reason,
[3245.42 → 3247.98] God never abandons us.
[3252.78 → 3254.38] When everything fell apart
[3254.38 → 3256.92] including his emotional stability,
[3257.40 → 3259.24] he knew he could
[3259.24 → 3260.20] take it to Christ
[3260.20 → 3263.08] and recentre his life
[3263.08 → 3264.22] on the things
[3264.22 → 3265.18] that truly matter.
[3266.74 → 3268.02] Notice the next verse.
[3268.22 → 3269.14] It is a beautiful,
[3269.30 → 3270.04] beautiful text.
[3270.18 → 3270.48] In fact,
[3270.56 → 3271.98] we sang about it.
[3272.02 → 3272.60] Can we have that?
[3272.60 → 3272.64] Can we have that?
[3276.42 → 3277.58] Psalm 56.
[3279.16 → 3280.04] You have collected
[3280.04 → 3281.04] all my tears
[3281.04 → 3281.92] in your bottle.
[3282.64 → 3283.42] You have recorded
[3283.42 → 3284.00] each one
[3284.00 → 3284.68] in your book.
[3284.68 → 3287.72] I want you to notice
[3287.72 → 3288.36] all
[3288.36 → 3289.32] and each one.
[3289.48 → 3290.10] God has collected
[3290.10 → 3291.34] all our tears
[3291.34 → 3292.58] and made a record
[3292.58 → 3293.96] of each one
[3293.96 → 3294.74] of those tears.
[3295.32 → 3295.46] Now,
[3295.56 → 3296.52] does God literally
[3296.52 → 3297.28] have a vial,
[3297.76 → 3298.18] you know,
[3298.58 → 3299.96] with my tears in it
[3299.96 → 3300.74] and your tears?
[3300.84 → 3302.04] Does he have a ledger
[3302.04 → 3303.02] that he writes in
[3303.02 → 3303.64] the hardships?
[3303.84 → 3304.10] No.
[3305.32 → 3306.98] This is metaphorical speech
[3306.98 → 3307.98] in order for us
[3307.98 → 3309.80] to be given
[3309.80 → 3310.44] the picture
[3310.44 → 3311.06] that God is
[3311.06 → 3312.16] a God of compassion
[3312.16 → 3313.30] and God of comfort
[3313.30 → 3314.52] who does not forget
[3314.52 → 3315.06] the pain
[3315.06 → 3316.60] we are going through.
[3317.28 → 3319.18] We are never alone
[3319.18 → 3319.98] in the midst
[3319.98 → 3320.84] of our hardship.
[3322.52 → 3324.04] Notice Psalm 66,
[3324.38 → 3325.08] the next one.
[3329.60 → 3332.74] And this is so tender
[3332.74 → 3333.38] and beautiful
[3333.38 → 3336.32] that I want you
[3336.32 → 3337.74] to capture this with me.
[3338.10 → 3338.90] God says,
[3339.48 → 3340.12] as a mother
[3340.12 → 3341.44] comforts her child,
[3341.44 → 3343.46] so I will comfort you.
[3344.00 → 3345.12] As a mother
[3345.12 → 3346.28] comforts her child,
[3346.42 → 3348.46] so I will comfort you.
[3349.72 → 3350.34] Imagine,
[3351.22 → 3353.76] in your holy imagination,
[3354.04 → 3355.14] here's a young mother
[3355.14 → 3356.90] cradling in her arms
[3356.90 → 3360.40] her infant child
[3360.40 → 3361.42] at her breast.
[3363.30 → 3364.22] And I can think
[3364.22 → 3364.70] of a picture
[3364.70 → 3365.64] that is more tender,
[3365.80 → 3366.52] more protective,
[3366.74 → 3368.20] more wholly devoted
[3368.20 → 3371.84] than among human relationships
[3371.84 → 3373.08] than a picture
[3373.08 → 3374.20] of such a mother
[3374.20 → 3376.74] cradling her infant child.
[3378.62 → 3379.72] And God says,
[3379.82 → 3380.96] when you go through troubles,
[3381.28 → 3383.56] think of me
[3383.56 → 3387.00] as a mother like that
[3387.00 → 3388.22] and think of yourself
[3388.22 → 3390.36] as that infant child.
[3391.64 → 3391.90] You know,
[3391.94 → 3392.72] it is interesting
[3392.72 → 3395.60] that young children,
[3396.14 → 3399.66] they cannot be encouraged
[3399.66 → 3401.00] in hardship,
[3401.74 → 3403.68] but they can be comforted.
[3404.40 → 3405.30] And here's the reason.
[3406.22 → 3407.58] If you were to go
[3407.58 → 3408.74] through a difficulty,
[3408.92 → 3409.98] you go to your pastor,
[3410.20 → 3411.86] your pastor may be able
[3411.86 → 3414.00] to ask some pastoral questions
[3414.00 → 3415.24] and help you unwrap
[3415.24 → 3416.28] the hardship
[3416.28 → 3417.14] you're going through
[3417.14 → 3417.94] and help you come
[3417.94 → 3418.92] to an understanding
[3418.92 → 3421.32] of why you are experiencing
[3421.32 → 3422.80] what you are experiencing.
[3423.30 → 3424.18] You may leave
[3424.18 → 3425.20] with a sense of hope
[3425.20 → 3426.12] after a little while
[3426.12 → 3426.92] because you've come
[3426.92 → 3427.84] to an understanding
[3427.84 → 3428.96] and having come
[3428.96 → 3429.78] to an understanding,
[3430.20 → 3432.58] you may have a cause
[3432.58 → 3437.38] or a plan of action
[3437.38 → 3439.00] whereby you can handle
[3439.00 → 3439.94] your disappointment.
[3441.38 → 3443.20] It comes through understanding.
[3444.08 → 3444.92] But when you think
[3444.92 → 3445.70] of little children,
[3445.84 → 3446.56] they don't have
[3446.56 → 3447.46] the capacity
[3447.46 → 3449.80] capacity to understand adversity.
[3451.50 → 3452.56] So what do you do
[3452.56 → 3453.98] with little children like that
[3453.98 → 3454.72] when you cannot
[3454.72 → 3455.62] help them understand?
[3456.82 → 3458.14] You comfort them.
[3459.18 → 3460.78] And how do you comfort them?
[3461.38 → 3462.90] Well, here's one way.
[3463.80 → 3464.52] As a mother,
[3465.06 → 3466.08] comforts her child.
[3466.68 → 3468.16] So I will comfort you.
[3468.96 → 3470.28] And there are times
[3470.28 → 3471.62] when our grief is so deep
[3471.62 → 3472.86] and so inexplicable
[3472.86 → 3474.92] that we can never understand
[3474.92 → 3476.90] why life is so deeply unfair
[3476.90 → 3478.68] and why it should affect us.
[3479.52 → 3481.50] And we ask why
[3481.50 → 3483.02] and we never get an answer.
[3483.16 → 3483.78] Then God says,
[3483.94 → 3484.68] think of me
[3484.68 → 3486.38] as a mother
[3486.38 → 3487.16] and you
[3487.16 → 3488.62] as a child
[3488.62 → 3489.42] that I cradle
[3489.42 → 3490.42] in my arms.
[3495.42 → 3495.98] Secondly,
[3497.00 → 3499.30] God helps us
[3499.30 → 3502.52] to go through the pain.
[3502.52 → 3508.76] God is not just compassionate,
[3508.94 → 3509.52] but he is able
[3509.52 → 3510.86] to hold us up.
[3510.98 → 3512.74] Notice this wonderful verse.
[3512.90 → 3513.34] And also,
[3513.66 → 3515.32] and I give credit
[3515.32 → 3516.94] to the designers
[3516.94 → 3517.58] of the service
[3517.58 → 3519.54] because this too
[3519.54 → 3520.36] we have sung
[3520.36 → 3522.04] just before the message.
[3522.84 → 3525.00] It says in Isaiah 43,
[3525.00 → 3526.14] O Israel,
[3526.40 → 3528.98] the Lord
[3528.98 → 3529.86] who created you
[3529.86 → 3530.34] says,
[3530.88 → 3532.54] do not be afraid.
[3533.60 → 3534.52] I have called you
[3534.52 → 3534.98] by name.
[3535.04 → 3535.66] You are mine
[3535.66 → 3536.54] when you go through
[3536.54 → 3537.18] deep waters
[3537.18 → 3537.90] in great trouble.
[3538.68 → 3539.86] I will be with you.
[3540.56 → 3541.30] And when you go
[3541.30 → 3541.82] through rivers
[3541.82 → 3542.50] of difficulty,
[3542.50 → 3543.66] you will not drown.
[3544.74 → 3545.50] When you walk
[3545.50 → 3546.12] through the fire
[3546.12 → 3546.66] of oppression,
[3546.66 → 3547.92] you will not be burned up.
[3547.98 → 3548.82] The flames will not
[3548.82 → 3549.58] consume you.
[3549.92 → 3550.56] And here's why.
[3550.68 → 3552.02] For I am the Lord
[3552.02 → 3552.48] your God.
[3552.56 → 3553.66] You are precious to me
[3553.66 → 3555.24] and I love you.
[3557.66 → 3558.42] And here,
[3558.54 → 3559.38] I want you to notice
[3559.38 → 3560.38] the three times
[3560.38 → 3562.36] the word through occurs.
[3562.60 → 3563.56] And what the Lord
[3563.56 → 3564.24] here says,
[3564.30 → 3564.78] when you go
[3564.78 → 3565.70] through deep waters,
[3566.48 → 3567.66] you're going to get wet
[3567.66 → 3568.18] and you're going
[3568.18 → 3569.06] to get cold.
[3569.84 → 3570.70] And I'm not going
[3570.70 → 3571.24] to fish you
[3571.24 → 3572.06] out of those waters,
[3572.26 → 3573.60] but I will be with you
[3573.60 → 3574.72] to make sure
[3574.72 → 3575.36] that you're going
[3575.36 → 3575.98] to come out
[3575.98 → 3577.52] through those waters.
[3578.08 → 3579.06] And when you go
[3579.06 → 3580.00] through great trouble
[3580.00 → 3581.16] and you just give
[3581.16 → 3582.10] that any meaning
[3582.10 → 3582.80] in your life
[3582.80 → 3583.60] what you want.
[3585.38 → 3586.16] When you go
[3586.16 → 3587.12] through great trouble,
[3588.22 → 3588.62] God says,
[3588.76 → 3589.68] I'm not going
[3589.68 → 3590.54] to fish you
[3590.54 → 3591.04] out of that.
[3591.40 → 3592.12] Often our prayers
[3592.12 → 3593.00] that way aren't.
[3593.16 → 3593.34] You know,
[3593.44 → 3594.06] God,
[3594.22 → 3594.46] you know,
[3594.46 → 3595.02] take this trouble
[3595.02 → 3595.66] away from me.
[3595.72 → 3596.10] And God says,
[3596.20 → 3596.48] no,
[3597.12 → 3598.66] but I will lead
[3598.66 → 3599.28] you through it.
[3599.90 → 3601.06] I will prove
[3601.06 → 3602.28] myself who I am
[3602.28 → 3603.20] by leading you
[3603.20 → 3604.32] through that great trouble,
[3604.46 → 3605.58] whatever that might
[3605.58 → 3606.44] mean in your life.
[3606.52 → 3607.46] And then he says,
[3607.60 → 3609.06] make sure that we get it
[3609.06 → 3610.04] when you go
[3610.04 → 3610.88] through the fires
[3610.88 → 3611.56] of oppression
[3611.56 → 3612.60] and again give that
[3612.60 → 3613.90] the content you want.
[3615.50 → 3616.24] God says,
[3616.30 → 3617.20] it's going to get hot,
[3617.34 → 3617.90] it's going to get
[3617.90 → 3618.44] uncomfortable,
[3618.66 → 3619.20] your hair's going
[3619.20 → 3620.08] to get singed.
[3621.40 → 3622.10] But I'm going
[3622.10 → 3622.80] to be with you.
[3623.66 → 3624.22] I'm going
[3624.22 → 3625.34] to make sure
[3625.34 → 3628.00] there'll be a shield
[3628.00 → 3628.98] around you
[3628.98 → 3630.96] and that you'll survive.
[3633.34 → 3633.98] God says,
[3634.06 → 3634.70] I will help you
[3634.70 → 3635.12] to go through
[3635.12 → 3635.90] hard times.
[3635.90 → 3637.06] You will not
[3637.06 → 3638.20] have to bear them
[3638.20 → 3638.90] alone.
[3639.88 → 3640.62] And here's why.
[3641.16 → 3641.76] Because I have
[3641.76 → 3643.02] called you by name.
[3643.72 → 3644.94] I've created you.
[3645.36 → 3646.06] You are precious
[3646.06 → 3646.70] to me.
[3647.10 → 3648.08] And I love you.
[3649.26 → 3650.00] Now you notice
[3650.00 → 3651.06] that I put a blank
[3651.06 → 3651.82] there after
[3651.82 → 3652.38] O Israel.
[3653.64 → 3655.02] And I did it
[3655.02 → 3655.72] for a reason
[3655.72 → 3656.78] because I want us
[3656.78 → 3658.38] to own this promise.
[3658.58 → 3658.76] You know,
[3658.80 → 3659.90] Paul says elsewhere
[3659.90 → 3660.76] to the Corinthians
[3660.76 → 3662.56] that because of Christ,
[3662.88 → 3663.84] every promise
[3663.84 → 3665.26] that God has made
[3665.26 → 3666.42] in the whole scripture
[3666.42 → 3667.94] is yes.
[3668.04 → 3668.48] That means
[3668.48 → 3669.88] we can claim that.
[3669.98 → 3671.02] We can own that.
[3671.40 → 3672.40] And so that is true
[3672.40 → 3673.38] of this verse.
[3673.72 → 3674.94] It has a different context.
[3675.20 → 3675.48] Sure.
[3675.92 → 3677.88] But the promise
[3677.88 → 3678.78] has a principle.
[3678.94 → 3679.64] And the principle
[3679.64 → 3680.68] is that God
[3680.68 → 3681.76] will be with us
[3681.76 → 3682.98] and to comfort
[3682.98 → 3684.14] and encourage us.
[3684.20 → 3684.96] And so what I'd like
[3684.96 → 3685.66] us to do
[3685.66 → 3686.74] is I'd like us
[3686.74 → 3687.54] to read this
[3687.54 → 3688.50] out loud together.
[3688.50 → 3689.64] But instead of reading
[3689.64 → 3690.58] O Israel,
[3691.00 → 3692.48] to insert your own name.
[3692.48 → 3694.18] So if your name
[3694.18 → 3694.60] is John,
[3694.66 → 3694.94] you say,
[3695.02 → 3695.46] O John.
[3695.54 → 3695.90] If your name
[3695.90 → 3696.32] is Janet,
[3696.40 → 3696.68] you say,
[3696.80 → 3697.24] O Janet.
[3697.32 → 3697.72] So I'm going
[3697.72 → 3698.62] to read OW out.
[3699.00 → 3700.00] Are you with me?
[3700.54 → 3701.58] So let's read it
[3701.58 → 3702.64] together out loud,
[3703.24 → 3704.32] inserting your name
[3704.32 → 3707.50] and claiming
[3707.50 → 3708.18] this promise
[3708.18 → 3708.96] for ourselves.
[3709.50 → 3710.32] Here we go.
[3711.46 → 3712.22] OW out,
[3712.70 → 3713.42] the Lord
[3713.42 → 3714.36] who created you
[3714.36 → 3714.86] says,
[3715.24 → 3716.32] do not be afraid.
[3716.32 → 3717.46] I have called
[3717.46 → 3718.28] you by name.
[3718.72 → 3719.52] You are mine.
[3719.72 → 3720.50] When you go
[3720.50 → 3721.44] through deep waters
[3721.44 → 3722.36] and great trouble,
[3722.56 → 3723.76] I will be with you.
[3724.14 → 3724.82] When you go
[3724.82 → 3725.50] through the rivers
[3725.50 → 3726.28] of difficulty,
[3726.46 → 3727.78] you will not drown.
[3728.18 → 3729.02] When you walk
[3729.02 → 3729.80] through the fires
[3729.80 → 3730.40] of oppression,
[3730.78 → 3731.60] you will not be
[3731.60 → 3732.16] burned up.
[3732.60 → 3733.06] The flames
[3733.06 → 3734.26] will not consume you
[3734.26 → 3735.52] for I am the Lord
[3735.52 → 3736.08] your God.
[3736.48 → 3737.22] You are precious
[3737.22 → 3737.78] to me
[3737.78 → 3739.16] and I love you.
[3740.14 → 3740.90] And next time
[3740.90 → 3741.42] you go through
[3741.42 → 3742.02] difficulty
[3742.02 → 3742.82] and some of you
[3742.82 → 3743.48] are going through
[3743.48 → 3744.38] difficult times
[3744.38 → 3744.98] right now,
[3745.10 → 3746.28] I want you to cling
[3746.28 → 3747.14] to this promise
[3747.14 → 3747.92] as a believer
[3747.92 → 3749.24] and brother in Christ.
[3749.24 → 3751.54] But that's not
[3751.54 → 3752.06] the end of it.
[3752.12 → 3753.12] There's a third thing
[3753.12 → 3755.22] in which God's comfort
[3755.22 → 3756.12] comes to us
[3756.12 → 3756.86] and it is this.
[3757.16 → 3758.16] God helps us
[3758.16 → 3758.80] to grow
[3758.80 → 3760.48] through our pain.
[3762.86 → 3763.54] Later on
[3763.54 → 3763.98] in this letter,
[3764.10 → 3764.70] Paul has a very
[3764.70 → 3765.44] famous passage
[3765.44 → 3766.64] where Paul goes
[3766.64 → 3768.00] through incredible
[3768.00 → 3769.52] hardship and pain.
[3770.88 → 3771.48] In fact,
[3771.62 → 3774.64] it is so nasty
[3774.64 → 3776.54] that he refers to it
[3776.54 → 3777.70] not only as a thorn
[3777.70 → 3778.64] in the flesh,
[3779.02 → 3779.22] you know,
[3779.30 → 3780.36] we can relate to that,
[3780.68 → 3782.12] but he also calls it
[3782.12 → 3783.76] a messenger of Satan.
[3784.22 → 3785.38] No one knows
[3785.38 → 3786.06] for sure
[3786.06 → 3787.44] what Paul is talking about
[3787.44 → 3789.10] except that we agree
[3789.10 → 3790.58] that what Paul went through
[3790.58 → 3793.64] must be extraordinarily difficult.
[3796.32 → 3797.16] And so when Paul
[3797.16 → 3798.00] had this messenger
[3798.00 → 3798.52] of Satan
[3798.52 → 3799.82] tormenting him,
[3799.94 → 3800.48] he says,
[3800.74 → 3801.98] I pray that God
[3801.98 → 3802.90] would take it away.
[3803.02 → 3803.50] And you know what?
[3803.56 → 3803.96] God said,
[3804.10 → 3804.36] no,
[3804.84 → 3805.48] I'm not.
[3805.48 → 3806.94] And Paul said,
[3806.98 → 3807.06] well,
[3807.06 → 3807.78] I prayed again.
[3807.86 → 3808.38] And God said,
[3808.46 → 3808.72] no,
[3808.84 → 3809.42] I'm not.
[3811.02 → 3812.10] And for a
[3812.10 → 3814.14] third time,
[3815.26 → 3816.22] Paul pleaded
[3816.22 → 3818.40] with God,
[3818.46 → 3818.94] his Saviour,
[3820.30 → 3821.04] deliver me
[3821.04 → 3822.06] from this messenger
[3822.06 → 3822.62] of Satan.
[3824.18 → 3824.72] And God said,
[3824.80 → 3825.00] no.
[3826.38 → 3826.82] Instead,
[3826.96 → 3828.02] here's what God said.
[3828.02 → 3831.24] God said to me,
[3831.32 → 3832.52] my grace is sufficient
[3832.52 → 3833.18] for you,
[3833.72 → 3835.02] for my power
[3835.02 → 3836.24] is made perfect
[3836.24 → 3837.36] in weakness.
[3838.40 → 3839.32] And so Paul says,
[3839.52 → 3840.46] so I delight
[3840.46 → 3841.26] in weaknesses
[3841.26 → 3842.32] and insults
[3842.32 → 3842.90] and hardships
[3842.90 → 3844.00] and persecutions
[3844.00 → 3844.72] and difficulties.
[3844.94 → 3846.60] For when I am weak,
[3846.74 → 3848.12] I am strong.
[3848.12 → 3849.68] And by this statement,
[3850.06 → 3852.30] Paul turns upside down
[3852.30 → 3854.42] every leadership principle
[3854.42 → 3855.40] you can think of
[3855.40 → 3856.28] because it always
[3856.28 → 3857.46] wants to capitalize
[3857.46 → 3858.40] on our strengths
[3858.40 → 3859.22] and our abilities.
[3859.34 → 3859.92] But Paul says,
[3860.06 → 3860.32] no,
[3860.68 → 3861.68] when I am weak,
[3861.86 → 3862.76] then spiritually,
[3863.04 → 3864.22] I am powerful.
[3868.90 → 3870.14] Because it is through
[3870.14 → 3871.68] this horrible experience
[3871.68 → 3873.50] that God has been able
[3873.50 → 3874.40] to teach me
[3874.40 → 3875.94] and help me grow
[3875.94 → 3876.64] in ways
[3876.64 → 3878.32] I would never have been able
[3878.32 → 3879.74] to without them.
[3879.74 → 3885.44] So why would God
[3885.44 → 3886.16] allow us to go
[3886.16 → 3886.78] through hardship?
[3887.30 → 3887.92] And sometimes,
[3888.18 → 3888.98] as I said earlier,
[3889.10 → 3889.92] we don't know.
[3890.46 → 3891.04] But maybe,
[3891.18 → 3892.52] maybe God allows us
[3892.52 → 3893.46] through a difficulty
[3893.46 → 3895.20] in order for us
[3895.20 → 3898.68] to learn
[3898.68 → 3900.28] a greater dependence
[3900.28 → 3901.48] and trust
[3901.48 → 3902.52] in God our Saviour.
[3904.40 → 3904.88] You know,
[3904.94 → 3905.48] as a pastor,
[3905.48 → 3907.38] I've come to pray
[3907.38 → 3908.22] for people
[3908.22 → 3910.26] who are ill.
[3910.54 → 3911.76] And I pray
[3911.76 → 3913.22] also in congregations,
[3913.42 → 3913.62] Lord,
[3913.74 → 3914.08] may they,
[3914.72 → 3915.04] sure,
[3915.18 → 3915.82] may they,
[3916.00 → 3916.74] will you heal them?
[3916.86 → 3918.12] That's an appropriate prayer,
[3918.28 → 3918.74] of course,
[3918.80 → 3919.18] to pray.
[3919.30 → 3920.42] But I also add,
[3920.60 → 3920.86] Lord,
[3920.96 → 3922.32] may they see something,
[3922.94 → 3924.36] discover something about you
[3924.36 → 3925.34] through this illness
[3925.34 → 3926.98] they would never have been able
[3926.98 → 3927.70] to see otherwise.
[3929.02 → 3930.48] Sometimes God allows us
[3930.48 → 3931.24] through difficulty
[3931.24 → 3932.40] in order that we may learn
[3932.40 → 3933.08] something about God
[3933.08 → 3933.78] we'd never be able
[3933.78 → 3934.16] to learn
[3934.16 → 3935.38] any other way.
[3936.12 → 3936.86] Another reason
[3936.86 → 3938.26] why God may lead us
[3938.26 → 3938.92] through difficulty
[3938.92 → 3941.10] is to put a damper
[3941.10 → 3941.80] on our pride.
[3944.10 → 3944.56] You know,
[3944.62 → 3945.40] sometimes we become
[3945.40 → 3946.04] too proud
[3946.04 → 3947.06] and we act
[3947.06 → 3947.64] in ways
[3947.64 → 3948.16] that are
[3948.16 → 3949.84] unchristlike.
[3950.78 → 3951.58] I've noticed
[3951.58 → 3952.46] in the last years
[3952.46 → 3953.28] of my ministry,
[3953.48 → 3954.14] I've been saying,
[3954.32 → 3955.40] don't you agree with me
[3955.40 → 3956.22] that all of us
[3956.22 → 3957.28] could go through life
[3957.28 → 3957.94] with a little bit
[3957.94 → 3958.64] more humility?
[3959.30 → 3960.06] Isn't that true?
[3961.38 → 3962.18] And sometimes
[3962.18 → 3962.94] adversity
[3962.94 → 3964.14] will teach us that.
[3964.16 → 3967.02] there's another reason
[3967.02 → 3968.72] why God may lead us
[3968.72 → 3969.70] through difficult times
[3969.70 → 3970.54] or allow us
[3970.54 → 3971.88] to go through difficult times
[3971.88 → 3973.02] and that is to,
[3973.16 → 3974.40] in order to remind us
[3974.40 → 3975.42] that we're not meant
[3975.42 → 3976.76] to go through life alone,
[3976.76 → 3979.80] that we need other people.
[3980.66 → 3980.84] You know,
[3980.90 → 3981.44] there is no,
[3981.50 → 3982.84] there is no such thing
[3982.84 → 3984.06] as a self-made man
[3984.06 → 3985.78] or a self-made woman.
[3986.64 → 3987.78] When you think about it,
[3987.82 → 3988.90] and I'm not going to unwrap that,
[3988.96 → 3989.88] but you think about that.
[3989.88 → 3990.88] And by the way,
[3991.46 → 3992.68] a self-made person
[3992.68 → 3994.06] always worships
[3994.06 → 3994.86] their own maker.
[3995.62 → 3996.08] Get it?
[4000.04 → 4001.56] Difficulties have a way
[4001.56 → 4002.58] to remind us
[4002.58 → 4004.14] that we need other people,
[4004.62 → 4005.48] our family,
[4005.64 → 4006.20] our friends,
[4006.34 → 4007.06] our congregation.
[4008.34 → 4009.60] There is one more reason
[4009.60 → 4012.08] why Paul may allow us to go,
[4012.28 → 4013.26] why God may allow us
[4013.26 → 4014.16] to go through difficulties.
[4014.56 → 4015.80] And that is in order
[4015.80 → 4019.76] to give us a ministry
[4019.76 → 4022.06] after we have transcended
[4022.06 → 4022.84] the pain,
[4023.04 → 4024.34] and that is what Paul
[4024.34 → 4025.46] hears all about.
[4025.46 → 4026.80] Because he says this,
[4026.80 → 4029.38] Praise be to God,
[4029.48 → 4030.78] Father of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[4030.84 → 4032.48] the Father of all compassion,
[4032.60 → 4033.52] the God of all comfort,
[4033.60 → 4034.30] who comforts us
[4034.30 → 4035.04] in all our troubles.
[4035.22 → 4035.54] Why?
[4037.46 → 4039.22] In order that we may comfort
[4039.22 → 4040.80] those in any trouble
[4040.80 → 4042.60] with the comfort
[4042.60 → 4043.56] we ourselves
[4043.56 → 4045.06] have received
[4045.06 → 4046.22] from God.
[4047.42 → 4048.04] And so,
[4048.22 → 4049.64] one reason why God
[4049.64 → 4051.26] chooses to comfort us
[4051.26 → 4052.72] is that we may
[4052.72 → 4054.20] be able to turn around
[4054.20 → 4055.10] and help people
[4055.10 → 4056.36] in the similar need
[4056.36 → 4057.36] that we were
[4057.36 → 4058.42] in order to be
[4058.42 → 4059.38] God's comfort
[4059.38 → 4060.38] through us.
[4061.02 → 4062.44] That you become
[4062.44 → 4063.10] God's comfort
[4063.10 → 4064.08] to other people.
[4064.90 → 4065.36] You know,
[4066.78 → 4067.76] George Fruit
[4067.76 → 4068.94] was a minister
[4068.94 → 4070.82] in one congregation
[4070.82 → 4072.00] for 47 years.
[4072.16 → 4073.64] I envy those pastors.
[4073.84 → 4075.14] I wish I had been able
[4075.14 → 4075.72] to do that.
[4078.06 → 4079.26] Few pastors do,
[4079.60 → 4080.28] but he did.
[4080.70 → 4081.56] And he wrote a memoir.
[4082.70 → 4083.48] And in that memoir,
[4083.66 → 4084.86] he recounts how
[4084.86 → 4086.66] a young family
[4086.66 → 4088.02] in his neighbourhood
[4088.02 → 4092.04] lost a small child.
[4093.34 → 4094.50] Didn't go to his church.
[4095.04 → 4095.72] But because he was
[4095.72 → 4096.54] so well known,
[4096.68 → 4097.86] he reached out to them
[4097.86 → 4099.00] and they were receptive
[4099.00 → 4101.38] to his council.
[4102.72 → 4106.84] And through his pastoral ministry
[4106.84 → 4107.94] to this family,
[4108.54 → 4109.60] he shared the gospel.
[4110.02 → 4111.02] They became Christians
[4111.02 → 4112.36] and joined his church.
[4115.62 → 4116.56] And then he says,
[4116.62 → 4117.22] a while later,
[4117.34 → 4118.94] another young family,
[4119.28 → 4120.76] this time from his own church,
[4120.88 → 4122.32] also lost an infant.
[4122.50 → 4122.92] And he says,
[4123.12 → 4125.18] after the funeral,
[4125.18 → 4128.50] I was with this second mother
[4128.50 → 4131.18] who lost her child
[4131.18 → 4133.88] and I didn't know what to say.
[4135.70 → 4139.56] She was in such pain and grief.
[4139.56 → 4141.62] But then all of a sudden,
[4141.70 → 4143.42] the first mother shows up.
[4144.56 → 4145.74] And she joined us,
[4145.98 → 4146.60] came alongside,
[4147.38 → 4148.34] and she turned
[4148.34 → 4150.24] to the second mother
[4150.24 → 4150.80] and said,
[4150.80 → 4154.52] I know what you're going through.
[4156.30 → 4158.16] And God has helped me
[4158.16 → 4160.80] to transcend the pain
[4160.80 → 4161.66] of the loss.
[4162.62 → 4163.14] And so,
[4163.38 → 4164.68] he will help you too.
[4168.58 → 4169.78] Ambassador Fruit
[4169.78 → 4171.80] comments
[4171.80 → 4173.14] and says,
[4173.26 → 4173.82] with those
[4173.82 → 4175.56] simple words
[4175.56 → 4178.24] that the first mother spoke,
[4179.38 → 4180.18] she did more
[4180.18 → 4181.12] to reach out
[4181.12 → 4182.10] to the second mother
[4182.10 → 4183.96] than I would have been able
[4183.96 → 4184.58] to do
[4184.58 → 4185.86] in months
[4185.86 → 4187.12] of pastoral visiting.
[4189.62 → 4190.50] You see,
[4190.60 → 4191.08] Paul says,
[4191.20 → 4192.18] praise be to God,
[4192.26 → 4193.70] the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4193.76 → 4194.58] the God of comfort
[4194.58 → 4195.46] who comes in all the trouble,
[4195.80 → 4196.96] so that we can comfort
[4196.96 → 4197.96] those in any trouble
[4197.96 → 4198.58] with the comfort
[4198.58 → 4199.22] we ourselves
[4199.22 → 4200.66] have received from God.
[4201.42 → 4201.78] Wow.
[4201.80 → 4204.84] And so,
[4204.96 → 4205.96] what does that look like?
[4206.96 → 4208.10] How do we comfort
[4208.10 → 4209.64] other people?
[4210.06 → 4210.80] Very quickly,
[4211.20 → 4211.96] three insights.
[4212.16 → 4212.86] First,
[4215.02 → 4215.48] can we,
[4216.86 → 4218.18] first,
[4218.22 → 4218.84] be helpful.
[4219.40 → 4220.10] I mean,
[4220.20 → 4221.64] simply be available.
[4221.98 → 4223.00] Notice what Paul says
[4223.00 → 4223.68] in the same letter,
[4223.78 → 4224.28] chapter 7,
[4224.34 → 4224.78] verse 6,
[4225.22 → 4226.34] God who comforts
[4226.34 → 4227.30] the downcast
[4227.30 → 4228.72] comforted us
[4228.72 → 4229.48] by the coming
[4229.48 → 4230.36] of Titus.
[4231.02 → 4231.50] Paul says,
[4231.50 → 4232.44] I was downcast.
[4232.66 → 4233.16] Let's call it
[4233.16 → 4233.68] what it was will.
[4233.80 → 4234.60] I was depressed.
[4235.94 → 4237.48] And God sent Titus
[4237.48 → 4238.06] to me
[4238.06 → 4240.06] in order to lift me up
[4240.06 → 4240.50] out of that.
[4241.86 → 4242.52] Paul doesn't say
[4242.52 → 4243.18] what he did
[4243.18 → 4244.76] and Paul doesn't say
[4244.76 → 4245.66] what he said.
[4246.34 → 4247.32] It was simply,
[4247.76 → 4249.14] Titus showed up
[4249.14 → 4250.58] and that was good enough.
[4250.58 → 4253.26] Do you remember the story
[4253.26 → 4253.80] of Job?
[4254.80 → 4255.04] Right?
[4255.20 → 4255.44] Job,
[4255.56 → 4256.10] horrible,
[4256.30 → 4257.10] horrible things
[4257.10 → 4257.92] happened to him
[4257.92 → 4258.62] so much so
[4258.62 → 4260.00] that his friends
[4260.00 → 4260.48] came
[4260.48 → 4262.66] and were to comfort him
[4262.66 → 4264.64] and they came to him
[4264.64 → 4266.02] and for seven days,
[4266.10 → 4266.76] remember that?
[4267.24 → 4268.34] For seven days,
[4268.38 → 4269.08] they were with him
[4269.08 → 4270.08] not saying a word.
[4270.94 → 4272.80] They simply showed up.
[4273.54 → 4274.54] Just be there.
[4275.50 → 4276.08] As pastors,
[4276.28 → 4278.68] we talk about
[4278.68 → 4280.56] the incarnational presence
[4280.56 → 4281.72] that we are Christ
[4281.72 → 4282.24] with others
[4282.24 → 4284.22] simply by being there.
[4284.60 → 4285.22] Being there
[4285.22 → 4287.48] is half the help.
[4288.28 → 4288.90] Elsewhere he says,
[4288.98 → 4289.32] you're helping
[4289.32 → 4290.20] by praying for us.
[4290.28 → 4290.98] Never stop praying
[4290.98 → 4291.78] for one another, folks.
[4292.14 → 4292.96] Only eternity
[4292.96 → 4294.08] will indicate
[4294.08 → 4295.04] the difference
[4295.04 → 4295.92] our prayers made.
[4296.06 → 4296.40] Secondly,
[4296.52 → 4297.24] let's be humble.
[4297.24 → 4299.46] you know,
[4299.54 → 4300.40] don't pretend
[4300.40 → 4301.38] you got it all together
[4301.38 → 4302.06] when you reach out
[4302.06 → 4302.94] to people in pain.
[4303.12 → 4303.58] Paul says,
[4303.66 → 4304.54] I think you ought to know.
[4305.00 → 4305.96] We were crushed
[4305.96 → 4306.88] and overwhelmed
[4306.88 → 4307.50] and we thought
[4307.50 → 4308.66] we'd never lived through it.
[4308.76 → 4309.16] See that?
[4309.44 → 4310.52] He despaired of life.
[4311.16 → 4311.82] Paul didn't say,
[4311.94 → 4312.32] well, you know,
[4312.40 → 4313.36] I don't need God's comfort.
[4313.44 → 4314.34] I'm a spiritual giant.
[4314.48 → 4314.66] No.
[4319.20 → 4320.42] And then third,
[4320.56 → 4321.16] be hopeful.
[4321.88 → 4322.52] Be hopeful.
[4323.96 → 4324.80] Paul says,
[4324.80 → 4327.62] our hope for you is firm
[4327.62 → 4329.78] because we have put
[4329.78 → 4330.58] our hope in him.
[4330.62 → 4332.26] And I put these two verses together
[4332.26 → 4334.04] for a very important reason.
[4334.20 → 4335.12] Sometimes we try
[4335.12 → 4335.88] to encourage people
[4335.88 → 4336.74] by saying,
[4336.86 → 4337.86] well, buckle up.
[4338.78 → 4339.82] Think positively.
[4340.38 → 4342.02] But that's not what Paul
[4342.02 → 4342.82] is doing here.
[4342.88 → 4343.10] He says,
[4343.16 → 4343.34] yes,
[4343.76 → 4344.52] there's hope.
[4345.44 → 4346.22] But there's hope
[4346.22 → 4347.00] not because I,
[4347.84 → 4349.72] or we think positively.
[4350.40 → 4351.24] There's hope
[4351.24 → 4352.40] because our hope
[4352.40 → 4353.44] is in Christ.
[4353.44 → 4355.30] He is our hope.
[4356.64 → 4357.48] It's not by,
[4357.48 → 4358.62] by pulling your own,
[4358.86 → 4360.14] by your own bootstraps,
[4360.26 → 4361.66] but by having our faith
[4361.66 → 4362.82] in the Saviour
[4362.82 → 4363.90] who's the God
[4363.90 → 4364.60] of all comfort.
[4365.78 → 4366.18] And so,
[4366.32 → 4367.46] my concluding question
[4367.46 → 4368.70] to you is simply this.
[4368.82 → 4370.44] Where are you at in life?
[4371.20 → 4372.42] Are you in need
[4372.42 → 4373.52] of God's comfort?
[4374.30 → 4375.68] Then allow God's comfort
[4375.68 → 4377.40] to flow to you
[4377.40 → 4378.72] through the ministry
[4378.72 → 4379.86] of the Holy Spirit.
[4380.00 → 4381.38] That is what He is for.
[4381.38 → 4383.80] Or are things
[4383.80 → 4385.14] pretty well in your life?
[4385.26 → 4386.46] Things are going smoothly.
[4386.98 → 4388.06] Well, if that is the case,
[4388.14 → 4388.60] then...
[4388.60 → 4389.46] I have a question for you.
[4389.60 → 4390.32] Yeah, go ahead.
[4390.32 → 4391.82] I will say a prayer
[4391.82 → 4393.64] until He's worried God
[4393.64 → 4395.14] to deliver us
[4395.14 → 4396.10] from evil
[4396.10 → 4397.32] and suffering.
[4398.02 → 4398.28] Okay?
[4398.58 → 4400.18] Instead of talking about it,
[4400.38 → 4400.84] let's do that.
[4400.84 → 4401.68] I will do that.
[4402.08 → 4402.88] I will do that.
[4403.38 → 4403.74] And so,
[4404.20 → 4404.40] or,
[4404.52 → 4405.46] or do we,
[4405.46 → 4406.76] or do we need
[4406.76 → 4407.32] to reach out
[4407.32 → 4408.02] to other people
[4408.02 → 4408.58] and pay
[4408.58 → 4410.68] and be God's comfort
[4410.68 → 4411.66] to them?
[4411.82 → 4412.76] Let's pray together.
[4415.92 → 4416.36] Father,
[4416.46 → 4417.28] we want to thank you
[4417.28 → 4418.26] that you have made
[4418.26 → 4419.08] yourself known
[4419.08 → 4419.84] as the God
[4419.84 → 4420.84] of all compassion
[4420.84 → 4421.72] and the Father
[4421.72 → 4422.56] of all comfort
[4422.56 → 4423.38] who comforts us
[4423.38 → 4424.46] in all of our troubles.
[4426.34 → 4427.22] And we pray
[4427.22 → 4428.78] that we may include you
[4428.78 → 4429.48] in our pain
[4429.48 → 4430.68] when we go through that
[4430.68 → 4432.38] and become accessible
[4432.38 → 4433.24] to the ministry
[4433.24 → 4433.66] of you,
[4433.66 → 4434.34] Holy Spirit.
[4436.32 → 4436.98] And Father,
[4437.04 → 4437.98] we pray for those
[4437.98 → 4438.88] of us who are going
[4438.88 → 4439.72] through difficulties
[4439.72 → 4441.02] and some of them are.
[4441.18 → 4441.84] I don't know them,
[4441.90 → 4442.50] but you do.
[4444.42 → 4445.70] And whatever it is,
[4445.82 → 4446.74] maybe it is a messenger
[4446.74 → 4447.28] of Satan
[4447.28 → 4449.10] that Paul talks about
[4449.10 → 4451.00] as a spiritual giant,
[4451.92 → 4452.78] a thorn in the flesh,
[4452.90 → 4453.92] or whatever it may be,
[4453.98 → 4455.34] a relational crisis.
[4456.94 → 4457.38] Father,
[4457.50 → 4458.10] we pray
[4458.10 → 4459.98] that you will help them
[4459.98 → 4462.38] to reach out to you
[4462.38 → 4463.10] in faith
[4463.10 → 4463.82] and that you will
[4463.82 → 4464.46] show them
[4464.46 → 4465.40] to be the God
[4465.40 → 4466.20] of compassion
[4466.20 → 4466.86] and comfort
[4466.86 → 4469.24] that you promised to be.
[4469.34 → 4469.84] And that is why
[4469.84 → 4470.74] we worship you.
[4472.64 → 4472.94] And so,
[4473.10 → 4473.38] Father,
[4473.88 → 4474.92] praise be to you
[4474.92 → 4476.40] and to the Son
[4476.40 → 4477.98] and to the Holy Spirit
[4477.98 → 4479.12] through Christ Jesus
[4479.12 → 4479.88] our Lord.
[4480.20 → 4480.54] Amen.
[4480.54 → 4480.68] Amen.
[4486.64 → 4487.90] We are going to sing
[4487.90 → 4488.50] a song
[4488.50 → 4490.32] in response
[4490.32 → 4490.94] and that is
[4490.94 → 4499.22] Cornerstone.
[4499.22 → 4499.28] Cornerstone.
[4499.28 → 4526.76] My hope is built on nothing less
[4526.76 → 4532.76] Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[4532.76 → 4538.76] I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
[4538.76 → 4545.76] But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[4547.76 → 4553.76] My hope is built on nothing less
[4553.76 → 4559.76] Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[4559.76 → 4564.76] I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
[4564.76 → 4571.76] But wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[4571.76 → 4577.76] Christ alone, cornerstone,
[4577.76 → 4582.76] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love,
[4582.76 → 4593.76] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
[4593.76 → 4601.76] When darkness seems to hide His face,
[4601.76 → 4606.76] I rest on His unchanging grace.
[4606.76 → 4612.76] In every high and stormy gale,
[4612.76 → 4618.76] My anchor holds within the veil.
[4618.76 → 4626.76] My anchor holds within the veil.
[4626.76 → 4632.76] Christ alone, cornerstone,
[4632.76 → 4638.76] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love,
[4638.76 → 4651.76] Through the storm He is Lord, Lord of all.
[4651.76 → 4656.76] When He shall come with trumpets sound,
[4656.76 → 4662.76] Oh, may I then in Him be found,
[4662.76 → 4667.76] Dressed in His righteousness alone,
[4667.76 → 4674.76] Faultless to stand before the throne.
[4674.76 → 4685.76] For me?
[4685.76 → 4686.76] Offerings?
[4686.76 → 4687.76] Right, yes.
[4694.76 → 4696.76] Not surprising, the offering this morning is for world hunger,
[4696.76 → 4698.76] And there will be a video shown during the offering.
[4698.76 → 4705.76] The deacons can come forward now.
[4705.76 → 4707.76] Food can always tell a story.
[4707.76 → 4710.76] In Bangladesh, food is the story of our mothers,
[4710.76 → 4713.76] Tending to compost and turning waste into nutrients.
[4713.76 → 4715.76] As they care for the earth,
[4715.76 → 4716.76] So they care for our bodies,
[4716.76 → 4718.76] Building our strength and intellect.
[4718.76 → 4721.76] Milan knows the power of food in our village.
[4721.76 → 4724.76] Her chickens and cows help send her son to university,
[4724.76 → 4725.76] Transforming his future.
[4725.76 → 4727.76] Because food educates.
[4727.76 → 4730.76] In Honduras, food is hospitality.
[4730.76 → 4732.76] A way for us to create plenty.
[4732.76 → 4736.76] Together we grow peppers and raise fish to feed our families.
[4736.76 → 4739.76] Together we deepen Myra's joy,
[4739.76 → 4741.76] Bring stability to the Areas,
[4741.76 → 4743.76] And crowd outside of Merlin's tortilla shop
[4743.76 → 4745.76] To support her bold new dream.
[4745.76 → 4748.76] Because food brings income.
[4748.76 → 4751.76] In Malawi, food means resilience.
[4751.76 → 4753.76] Beneath the hot sun we battle the climate.
[4753.76 → 4756.76] But our new farming methods have prevented disaster.
[4756.76 → 4759.76] Now, McDonald's children have a chance for life.
[4759.76 → 4762.76] There are beacons of hope for tomorrow.
[4762.76 → 4765.76] Because food saves.
[4765.76 → 4767.76] Once our stories were defined by hunger.
[4767.76 → 4772.76] But now, with churches like yours sharing the love of God through the right tools and training,
[4772.76 → 4775.76] Our stories are inspired by a hunger for good.
[4775.76 → 4779.76] Every story of hunger changed through world renew was made possible by someone like you.
[4779.76 → 4788.76] A gift of $200 gives a farmer the tools, training, and supplies needed to feed their family for a year.
[4788.76 → 4790.76] Give to meet their hunger today.
[4790.76 → 4805.76] It's the time now for our morning community prayer.
[4805.76 → 4808.76] Many of you have been wondering what's been happening with Fou Vanzetti.
[4808.76 → 4813.76] And since she had a significant surgery on Friday, and it was too late for the bulletin.
[4813.76 → 4814.76] She had open-heart surgery.
[4814.76 → 4816.76] She's not young at VGH.
[4816.76 → 4824.76] And the news is really quite good that I had this morning.
[4824.76 → 4826.76] They made her get up the next day.
[4826.76 → 4828.76] And the surgery went well.
[4828.76 → 4829.76] Got her up.
[4829.76 → 4831.76] Made her eat.
[4831.76 → 4835.76] There was a text between Joe and her husband, Mustafa, this morning.
[4835.76 → 4840.76] And apparently all the evidence so far is that she's recovering very normally.
[4840.76 → 4844.76] So we have reason to be thankful this morning.
[4844.76 → 4847.76] Shall we come to God in prayer?
[4850.76 → 4853.76] God, as we come to you this morning, we testify.
[4853.76 → 4855.76] You are the almighty God.
[4855.76 → 4859.76] You are present in all things, yet in no way limited by them.
[4859.76 → 4866.76] You remain unaffected by place, untouched by time, undeceived by words.
[4866.76 → 4873.76] You are unseen, yet you have been known to all of us who seek you with hope and love.
[4873.76 → 4881.76] You created a universe with 200 billion galaxies, each of them about 100 million stars.
[4881.76 → 4887.76] Here we are, one small blue dot, circling around one star.
[4887.76 → 4900.76] Yet you have chosen to create, sustain, love, and stay close to a people that are in some mysterious way made in your likeness.
[4900.76 → 4906.76] And when we fail to live up to your standards in so many sinful ways, you still abide us.
[4906.76 → 4916.76] It must be in part because there are some who continue to call on you and honour you even imperfectly.
[4916.76 → 4923.76] That we do this morning as one small group in your worldwide church.
[4923.76 → 4934.76] We therefore approach your throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to find help for us in times of need.
[4934.76 → 4942.76] All we have said and read this morning, Lord, that we know the suffering of the world matters to you from empty bellies to the evils of racism.
[4942.76 → 4949.76] Your heart aches for those who experience ongoing harm and need.
[4949.76 → 4955.76] Let us share your love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.
[4955.76 → 4962.76] Let us not withhold good and goods when it is within our power to act.
[4962.76 → 4964.76] We have concerns throughout the world.
[4964.76 → 4970.76] There is much unrest throughout the world right now, not all of us makes the news every day.
[4970.76 → 4973.76] You know of the war in Ukraine.
[4973.76 → 4976.76] We worry about the suffering that happens there.
[4976.76 → 4980.76] We ask for peace and restoration in a war-torn country.
[4980.76 → 4990.76] Similarly, there is unrest in Iran for those that we see reacting to unfair oppression by an Islamic theocratic government.
[4990.76 → 4993.76] Similar problems in Afghanistan.
[4993.76 → 5001.76] There are civil wars going on in Ethiopia and Yemen and the ends are not entirely in sight.
[5001.76 → 5011.76] And while there are combatants involved in all these areas of unrest, the biggest sufferers are those people who have nothing to do with the war who are just trying to survive and eat.
[5011.76 → 5018.76] We pray for resolution, for peace, for justice in these countries.
[5018.76 → 5021.76] We pray for the help that World Renew can provide them.
[5021.76 → 5028.76] We pray for our own government leaders, and we ask for just leadership here in Canada.
[5028.76 → 5033.76] We also are aware that there is an upcoming election in the U.S.
[5033.76 → 5043.76] And there too, we pray for peaceful elections and for voting with discernment, searching out reliable facts before deciding on candidates.
[5043.76 → 5057.76] In these times of significant economic uncertainty, we ask for wisdom and justice as our leaders are charged with finding solutions to not simple but very complex problems.
[5057.76 → 5059.76] We hold up our own church leaders.
[5059.76 → 5062.76] We are thankful for the willingness of our elders and deacons to serve.
[5062.76 → 5067.76] And we ask that you guide them as they make decisions in the life of this church.
[5067.76 → 5081.76] Work through them and Pastor Jason as he does your work as a spiritual leader, dealing with individuals during the week and then bringing your word to us each Sunday.
[5081.76 → 5087.76] Unstable weather has harmful effects, and we have seen and heard of them in our own cities in British Columbia.
[5087.76 → 5095.76] But elsewhere, Hurricane Fiona in the Canadian East Coast has still people recovering with significant damage.
[5095.76 → 5112.76] Similarly, Hurricane Ian in Florida has created even greater devastation, and we pray for the efforts of World Renew and others in helping especially low income people recover from those impacts.
[5112.76 → 5118.76] We have local concerns in our own congregation for those with health and treatment and medical issues.
[5118.76 → 5126.76] The word about Fowl and Vanzetti this morning is really positive, and we are thankful for you for your healing hand.
[5126.76 → 5134.76] We look to doctors to fix problems, but you are the great healer, and we are thankful for that measure of healing we have already seen here.
[5134.76 → 5141.76] Pat Barman is still being treated for breast cancer, and we pray for her successful treatment and recovery.
[5141.76 → 5158.76] Jordan is still dealing with cancer treatment and its treatment, but the outcome appears positive, and we can offer him up to you for complete healing with positive thoughts.
[5158.76 → 5161.76] There are other ongoing health and aging concerns.
[5161.76 → 5176.76] Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Mark, Jerry and Ann, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, Henry.
[5176.76 → 5189.76] We pray for all these people as they are dealing with the effects of old age, ongoing chronic illness and other things that they could draw comfort from their knowledge and understanding of you.
[5189.76 → 5201.76] There may be others with chronic or hidden hurts or concerns or other loved ones of our members who are also having very real needs of guidance, assistance or healing.
[5201.76 → 5216.76] Though we don't mention all their names this morning, we approach your throne of grace with confidence so that we may, that we and they may receive mercy and find grace to help us and them in our times of need.
[5216.76 → 5228.76] Despite our sins and shortcomings and at times forgetfulness and looking first to you in all things, we still approach you with humility to ask for these things.
[5228.76 → 5235.76] Where needs are met and you're healing and guiding hand is evident, we will return to give thanks for you.
[5235.76 → 5238.76] For in the end, to whom else shall we go?
[5238.76 → 5250.76] Finally, as Paul wrote to the Ephesians, to you, God of plenty, be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.
[5250.76 → 5252.76] And we say amen.
[5252.76 → 5253.76] Amen.
[5253.76 → 5263.76] All right.
[5263.76 → 5264.76] What do we say?
[5264.76 → 5265.76] Well, the Lord, the Lord will make us feel in love for you, and it is not to be thankful for you.
[5265.76 → 5266.76] And you repent, each day you will never come again.
[5266.76 → 5267.76] We'll rise.
[5267.76 → 5275.76] We'll rise with me as we prepare to go into a brand-new week, a week that's never been before and a week that will never come again.
[5275.76 → 5277.76] And so the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5277.76 → 5280.76] The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5280.76 → 5286.76] The Lord lift His countenance upon you and grant you comfort and peace through Christ.
[5286.76 → 5287.76] Amen.
[5287.76 → 5306.82] Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
[5306.82 → 5314.06] Brought me all else to be saved at the heart.
[5314.06 → 5321.54] Thou my birth, thaw out by day or by night,
[5321.94 → 5328.86] Wicking or sweeping thy presence, my light.
[5331.02 → 5337.72] Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word,
[5337.72 → 5344.90] I ever with thee, and thou with me, Lord.
[5345.40 → 5352.14] Thou my great Father, thine own may I be,
[5352.68 → 5359.48] Thou in me dwelling, and I one with thee.
[5359.48 → 5368.88] My King of Heaven, my victory won,
[5369.42 → 5375.48] May I be challenged to your bright heaven's sun,
[5375.48 → 5382.48] Heart upon all heart, whatever befall,
[5382.48 → 5391.48] Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
[5391.48 → 5398.48] My King of Heaven, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God.
[5398.48 → 5407.74] Alec the Lord, my God, my Son of then, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my house.
[5407.76 → 5408.48] Made.
[5408.48 → 5410.48] Amen.
[5438.48 → 5440.48] Amen.
[5468.48 → 5470.48] Amen.
