[297.80 --> 298.80]  Good morning, everyone.
[298.80 --> 299.80]  Good morning.
[299.80 --> 303.80]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[303.80 --> 307.80]  It's great to be gathered with God's people to worship the Lord together.
[307.80 --> 314.80]  If you are new here today, we especially welcome you, and we're so glad you're here.
[314.80 --> 319.80]  And also welcome to all of our regular attenders and those online and everyone who has gathered.
[319.80 --> 325.80]  Just a few announcements today before we begin our worship service.
[325.80 --> 332.80]  One is that today, right after the service, everyone is invited to share a time of coffee and fellowship.
[332.80 --> 337.80]  And that is actually going to happen right outside these doors in the foyer, not in the fellowship room.
[337.80 --> 345.80]  And the reason is because actually today or yesterday is a very special holiday in the Chinese calendar.
[345.80 --> 348.80]  Mid-autumn festival, Zhongqiujie.
[348.80 --> 354.80]  And our Chinese ministry is going to host a lunch.
[354.80 --> 360.80]  So I'm very excited because there will be dumplings and there will be noodles and there will be mooncakes.
[360.80 --> 364.80]  And they want to invite all of us to join.
[364.80 --> 367.80]  So that will be in the fellowship hall at 1230.
[367.80 --> 369.80]  So after the service, have some coffee.
[369.80 --> 375.80]  And if you are available and would like to stay at 1230, you can join for lunch.
[375.80 --> 381.80]  So this is the fall and it's a time when many ministries get started up again.
[381.80 --> 384.80]  And so if you, I would just encourage you to look at the bulletin.
[384.80 --> 389.80]  There are just a bunch of announcements about all kinds of different ministries starting up.
[389.80 --> 393.80]  Our GEMS and Cadets and Youth Group.
[393.80 --> 397.80]  Our cross training adult Sunday school class will be beginning.
[397.80 --> 399.80]  Our Friendship Club has begun.
[399.80 --> 405.80]  And also we want to reboot our small group ministry.
[405.80 --> 411.80]  So I want to encourage everyone to consider being in community.
[411.80 --> 413.80]  Finding a group that you can belong to.
[413.80 --> 416.80]  And so I want to invite you to sign up.
[416.80 --> 419.80]  And there's a sign up sheet right on the table in the foyer.
[419.80 --> 422.80]  And even if you've been in a group in the past,
[422.80 --> 424.80]  and even if you want to stay in that group going forward,
[424.80 --> 426.80]  just go ahead and put your name down.
[426.80 --> 429.80]  And so we can kind of figure out everyone who's going to be involved
[429.80 --> 431.80]  and how we might best configure that.
[431.80 --> 433.80]  So please do that.
[433.80 --> 439.80]  Lastly, I feel like there's a weird exo, right?
[439.80 --> 445.80]  Anyway, lastly, look at my notes.
[445.80 --> 447.80]  Ah, yes.
[447.80 --> 450.80]  Two Sundays ago, we had a baptism.
[450.80 --> 453.80]  We had seven baptisms of men and women from our Chinese ministry.
[453.80 --> 455.80]  Martin and Anne Hamming hosted it.
[455.80 --> 456.80]  It was a wonderful time.
[456.80 --> 459.80]  For those of you who were there, know.
[459.80 --> 461.80]  And for those of you who weren't there,
[461.80 --> 462.80]  we want to share a couple photos.
[462.80 --> 464.80]  So you can see what happened.
[464.80 --> 466.80]  So we're going to have a quick slide.
[480.80 --> 481.80]  Thank you.
[481.80 --> 482.80]  Thank you.
[482.80 --> 483.80]  Thank you.
[483.80 --> 485.80]  Thank you.
[485.80 --> 503.86]  foreign
[504.28 --> 508.74]  foreign
[513.70 --> 515.24]  foreign
[515.24 --> 517.56]  with me, on me great year.
[533.32 --> 535.24]  It really was a wonderful time.
[535.68 --> 537.56]  And I want to share why for a couple of reasons.
[537.74 --> 540.26]  One is we were able to share fellowship
[540.26 --> 541.52]  with our Mandarin congregation,
[541.66 --> 543.20]  our English congregation to be together.
[543.20 --> 545.68]  And not only was it a baptism,
[545.86 --> 546.86]  but it was a celebration.
[547.12 --> 549.56]  We ate great food, we danced, we sang.
[550.16 --> 551.02]  It was a party.
[551.12 --> 551.80]  It was a lot of fun.
[552.16 --> 553.76]  So I hope we can do these kind of things
[553.76 --> 554.48]  more in the future.
[555.28 --> 557.10]  So now let's prepare our hearts
[557.10 --> 558.92]  to come before the Lord in worship.
[559.26 --> 561.12]  You know, the reason we come here each week
[561.12 --> 564.58]  for those of us who know the Lord Jesus
[564.58 --> 569.68]  is because our hearts have been fully captured by God.
[570.30 --> 572.98]  We are gripped by what God has done for us
[572.98 --> 573.84]  in Jesus Christ.
[575.64 --> 577.94]  And in worshiping Jesus,
[578.18 --> 580.44]  we find that the deepest longings
[580.44 --> 582.84]  that each one of us have in our hearts
[582.84 --> 585.58]  for beauty and truth and goodness
[585.58 --> 587.34]  and justice and meaning,
[588.34 --> 590.80]  that God is the only one
[590.80 --> 593.46]  who is capable of truly satisfying
[593.46 --> 595.64]  those longings that we have.
[595.64 --> 599.30]  And that's why we come here today
[599.30 --> 600.94]  to worship God
[600.94 --> 604.06]  and to acknowledge that he is worthy of our praise.
[604.46 --> 606.50]  So we respond to his invitation
[606.50 --> 609.42]  to us to come and to worship him.
[610.16 --> 611.80]  And our call to worship this morning
[611.80 --> 615.54]  is based on Psalm 86 and 73,
[616.10 --> 618.22]  where it has the two, the double arrow.
[618.54 --> 620.54]  I invite you to respond and read it out loud with me.
[620.54 --> 624.60]  There is none like you, O Lord,
[625.06 --> 627.50]  nor are there any works like yours.
[629.00 --> 631.30]  All the nations you have made
[631.30 --> 634.60]  will come and worship before you, O Lord,
[635.04 --> 637.08]  and glorify your name.
[637.08 --> 641.14]  For you are great and do wondrous things.
[641.28 --> 642.88]  You alone are God.
[642.88 --> 647.38]  Whom have I in heaven but you?
[647.94 --> 651.70]  And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
[652.84 --> 655.62]  My flesh and my heart may fail,
[656.10 --> 658.74]  but God is the strength of my heart
[658.74 --> 661.46]  and my portion forevermore.
[661.80 --> 664.04]  Would you please join me in prayer
[664.04 --> 667.12]  as we come before our God?
[668.58 --> 670.76]  Father, we come before you this morning
[670.76 --> 674.04]  because you are the source of every good and perfect thing.
[674.82 --> 676.34]  Lord, you created the world
[676.34 --> 678.38]  in all of its glory and goodness.
[679.08 --> 682.34]  You put the planets and stars into motion
[682.34 --> 685.86]  and you continue to sustain their movements
[685.86 --> 687.98]  even now by the power of your word.
[689.30 --> 691.48]  And Father, not only the stars and planets,
[692.04 --> 695.24]  but also it is in you that we, your people,
[695.38 --> 697.28]  live and move and have our being.
[697.28 --> 701.74]  Jesus, we praise you for coming into this world
[701.74 --> 704.24]  that is darkened by sin and rebellion
[704.24 --> 707.44]  to rescue us at the cross
[707.44 --> 711.00]  and to rise again to renew all things.
[712.50 --> 714.20]  Holy Spirit, we praise you
[714.20 --> 716.20]  for giving us new life in Christ
[716.20 --> 718.78]  and making us children of God through faith.
[719.66 --> 722.00]  We praise you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[723.34 --> 725.24]  Help us to focus on you today.
[725.24 --> 729.20]  Father, quiet our minds.
[730.20 --> 734.52]  Calm our hearts that race to all the things left undone
[734.52 --> 737.28]  and to the things that we have yet to do.
[738.84 --> 740.34]  Lord, help us to worship you.
[741.34 --> 743.44]  We are thankful that you love us so much
[743.44 --> 745.40]  that you call us to be part of your family.
[746.66 --> 748.84]  Thank you for the blessing of knowing you
[748.84 --> 751.66]  and help us to know you better in this time
[751.66 --> 753.10]  that we have together of worship.
[753.10 --> 755.74]  Help us now to praise you
[755.74 --> 757.66]  and bless your name
[757.66 --> 760.98]  for our glory,
[761.42 --> 762.56]  or for your glory, Lord,
[762.64 --> 763.60]  and our good.
[764.08 --> 765.62]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[766.18 --> 766.46]  Amen.
[767.82 --> 769.72]  I want to invite you to stand
[769.72 --> 772.72]  in body or in spirit as you are able
[772.72 --> 774.32]  for God's greeting to us
[774.32 --> 777.26]  from 2 Peter 1, verse 2.
[777.64 --> 778.46]  It says this,
[779.52 --> 782.08]  May grace and peace be yours in abundance
[782.08 --> 783.90]  in the knowledge of God
[783.90 --> 786.48]  and of Jesus our Lord.
[787.48 --> 788.90]  So friends, as God has called us,
[788.96 --> 789.86]  he's welcomed us,
[789.92 --> 790.88]  he's brought us together,
[791.34 --> 792.00]  let's turn,
[792.32 --> 793.14]  let's greet one another
[793.14 --> 794.16]  in the name of the Lord.
[794.78 --> 795.66]  Turn and greet one another.
[795.88 --> 796.48]  Amen.
[796.66 --> 796.88]  Amen.
[796.88 --> 798.88]  Amen.
[798.88 --> 799.46]  Amen.
[799.46 --> 799.98]  Amen.
[799.98 --> 800.28]  Amen.
[800.28 --> 801.24]  Amen.
[801.62 --> 801.72]  Amen.
[801.82 --> 801.92]  Amen.
[801.92 --> 802.52]  Amen.
[802.62 --> 802.82]  Amen.
[802.90 --> 803.12]  Amen.
[803.80 --> 804.42]  Amen.
[804.58 --> 804.60]  Amen.
[804.62 --> 804.72]  Amen.
[805.18 --> 805.44]  Amen.
[805.44 --> 805.46]  Amen.
[805.70 --> 806.46]  Amen.
[806.56 --> 806.70]  Amen.
[806.70 --> 807.54]  Amen.
[807.54 --> 808.08]  Amen.
[808.24 --> 808.66]  Amen.
[809.30 --> 809.52]  Amen.
[809.52 --> 810.58]  Amen.
[810.58 --> 810.76]  Amen.
[814.90 --> 815.78]  Amen.
[816.20 --> 825.32]  Amen.
[825.32 --> 835.90]  As we turn to sing our first song, Here I Am to Worship It.
[835.90 --> 841.58]  And it's interesting to me that when I made the choices for today,
[842.18 --> 848.44]  I wasn't aware of other events that were going to be happening this week with the Queen and our new King.
[848.44 --> 860.64]  But today the imagery in a lot of our songs refers to kingship and that whole concept of leadership and honor and respect
[860.64 --> 864.06]  has been highlighted for us in news events.
[864.60 --> 871.56]  And we look to the King of all kings throughout our words and our songs today.
[871.56 --> 880.58]  So I just wanted to highlight the focus that the songs seem to put on appropriately our King in Heaven.
[880.72 --> 881.98]  So here we are to worship.
[881.98 --> 900.72]  Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[901.14 --> 905.02]  Open my eyes, let me see.
[905.02 --> 921.02]  Here I am to worship.
[921.02 --> 924.72]  Here I am to bow down.
[924.72 --> 930.02]  Here I am to say that you're my God.
[930.02 --> 941.22]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[945.72 --> 955.46]  King of all days, oh so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above.
[955.46 --> 985.44]  King of all days, oh so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above.
[985.44 --> 992.54]  All together, wonderful to me.
[992.54 --> 1003.74]  I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon the cross.
[1003.74 --> 1013.74]  I'll never know how much it cost to sing my sin upon the cross.
[1014.60 --> 1024.74]  I'll never know how much it cost to sing my sin upon the cross.
[1024.74 --> 1038.02]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[1038.36 --> 1048.34]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[1054.74 --> 1066.20]  We have some flowers at the front of the church.
[1066.52 --> 1076.06]  And I think the words that are again brought forward through this hymn, Joyful Joyful, about flowers unfold,
[1076.64 --> 1083.62]  I think is a wonderful image for us to always look to as our response of worship,
[1083.62 --> 1089.38]  as the flowers turn toward the sun in the morning and they follow and track and open up
[1089.38 --> 1091.70]  and become their most beautiful in the daylight.
[1092.26 --> 1099.20]  In the wonder and the realization of who God is, our hearts open up
[1099.20 --> 1104.46]  and we give him the praise and the glory that he deserves.
[1104.86 --> 1109.08]  So let's sing joyfully this song of praise.
[1113.62 --> 1127.30]  Joyful Joyful, joyful we adore thee, God of glory, Lord above.
[1127.30 --> 1135.76]  Hearts unfold, find flowers before thee, O King to the Son of God.
[1135.76 --> 1143.94]  Melt the clouds of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away.
[1143.94 --> 1153.18]  Give her a beautiful heart of gladness, fill us with the light of day.
[1154.24 --> 1162.44]  All thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heaven reflect thy ways.
[1162.44 --> 1170.90]  Stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.
[1170.90 --> 1179.12]  Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea.
[1179.74 --> 1187.90]  Chanting bird and flowing fountain calls us to rejoice in thee.
[1187.90 --> 1198.90]  Thou art giving and forgiving, everlasting everlasting everlasting everlasting everlasting everlasting.
[1198.90 --> 1208.94]  Thou spring of the joy of living ocean depths of happy rest.
[1209.36 --> 1217.88]  Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are thee.
[1217.88 --> 1222.88]  Teach us how to love each other.
[1222.88 --> 1228.20]  Dift us to the joy divine.
[1229.88 --> 1231.12]  Amen.
[1247.88 --> 1255.40]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[1255.40 --> 1259.16]  Open the eyes of my heart
[1259.16 --> 1262.14]  I want to see you
[1262.14 --> 1266.14]  I want to see you
[1266.14 --> 1272.04]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[1272.04 --> 1275.32]  Open the eyes of my heart
[1275.32 --> 1278.28]  I want to see you
[1278.28 --> 1282.58]  I want to see you
[1282.58 --> 1287.06]  To see you high and lifted up
[1287.06 --> 1291.50]  Shining in the light of your glory
[1291.50 --> 1294.96]  Oh, much of power and love
[1294.96 --> 1298.90]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[1298.90 --> 1305.12]  Holy, holy, holy
[1305.12 --> 1309.00]  Holy, holy, holy
[1309.00 --> 1312.96]  Holy, holy, holy
[1312.96 --> 1316.38]  I want to see you
[1316.38 --> 1320.90]  Holy, holy, holy
[1321.08 --> 1324.86]  Holy, holy, holy
[1324.86 --> 1328.74]  Holy, holy, holy
[1328.74 --> 1331.70]  I want to see you
[1331.70 --> 1333.70]  From the beginning again
[1333.70 --> 1337.12]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[1337.12 --> 1340.74]  Open the eyes of my heart
[1340.74 --> 1343.70]  I want to see you
[1343.70 --> 1347.70]  I want to see you
[1347.70 --> 1352.58]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[1352.58 --> 1355.96]  Open the eyes of my heart
[1355.96 --> 1358.96]  I want to see you
[1358.96 --> 1362.96]  I want to see you
[1362.96 --> 1367.66]  To see you high and lifted up
[1367.66 --> 1371.96]  Shining in the light of your glory
[1371.96 --> 1373.10]  I want to see you
[1373.10 --> 1375.44]  Round to power and love
[1375.44 --> 1379.08]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[1379.08 --> 1385.24]  Holy Holy Holy
[1385.24 --> 1396.52]  I want to see you
[1398.66 --> 1401.68]  Holy Holy Holy
[1401.68 --> 1405.72]  Holy, holy, holy
[1405.72 --> 1409.86]  Holy, holy, holy
[1409.86 --> 1414.08]  I want to see you
[1414.08 --> 1417.54]  You may be seated.
[1425.70 --> 1430.10]  So we come now to a time of confession and assurance.
[1430.10 --> 1434.84]  You know, this longing that we talked about, this longing that we have for God
[1434.84 --> 1438.74]  cannot be something that only consumes our lives
[1438.74 --> 1440.92]  this one day of the week on Sundays.
[1442.68 --> 1446.02]  Because this incredible God who created us and who loves us
[1446.02 --> 1449.70]  wants us to love him and to follow him every day
[1449.70 --> 1453.72]  of our lives. In our thoughts and in our actions
[1453.72 --> 1458.08]  and in our words. But just like in any relationship that we all have with one
[1458.08 --> 1461.28]  another, even with someone whom you truly love
[1461.28 --> 1464.66]  we sometimes make choices and decisions
[1464.66 --> 1467.58]  that hurt God. We think thoughts
[1467.58 --> 1468.66]  we speak words
[1468.66 --> 1473.14]  we react to situations in ways that are not how God would
[1473.14 --> 1474.72]  have us to live.
[1476.92 --> 1479.58]  Sometimes we fail to consider what God wants
[1479.58 --> 1481.40]  with every single part of our lives
[1481.40 --> 1484.96]  not just with certain parts that we are more willing
[1484.96 --> 1487.06]  to give him than others.
[1488.28 --> 1489.94]  But when we do this
[1489.94 --> 1492.62]  God does not immediately
[1492.62 --> 1494.24]  leave the relationship.
[1494.94 --> 1495.68]  Praise be to God.
[1496.86 --> 1498.52]  Instead, he invites us to trust
[1498.52 --> 1500.44]  more deeply in what he has done
[1500.44 --> 1502.60]  for us. He wants us to be
[1502.60 --> 1504.60]  gripped by his great love shown to us
[1504.60 --> 1506.44]  through Jesus Christ who came
[1506.44 --> 1508.52]  to die for our sins that we
[1508.52 --> 1511.60]  might be forgiven. In one way
[1511.60 --> 1514.94]  he helps us to repair our relationship
[1514.94 --> 1517.80]  with him is through honesty and confession.
[1519.08 --> 1520.98]  So let's pray this prayer confession
[1520.98 --> 1522.34]  in unison together
[1522.34 --> 1525.44]  now. It's a prayer confession based on Psalm 25.
[1526.56 --> 1527.58]  Please join me.
[1529.08 --> 1530.22]  Remember Lord
[1530.22 --> 1532.74]  your great mercy and love
[1532.74 --> 1535.20]  for they are from of old.
[1535.20 --> 1539.12]  Do not remember the sins of my youth
[1539.12 --> 1541.46]  in my rebellious ways.
[1542.70 --> 1544.44]  According to your love
[1544.44 --> 1545.62]  remember me
[1545.62 --> 1547.38]  for you Lord
[1547.38 --> 1548.24]  are good.
[1549.60 --> 1550.94]  Look on my affliction
[1550.94 --> 1552.18]  and my distress
[1552.18 --> 1553.62]  and forgive
[1553.62 --> 1555.12]  all my sins.
[1555.68 --> 1557.24]  Let's confess our sins to God
[1557.24 --> 1558.02]  silently now.
[1558.02 --> 1558.08]  Amen.
[1558.08 --> 1558.14]  Amen.
[1565.20 --> 1587.50]  Heavenly Father we thank you for the grace
[1587.50 --> 1589.68]  that calls us into your presence
[1589.68 --> 1591.60]  through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1591.60 --> 1595.08]  we thank you that even when we hurt you
[1595.08 --> 1597.30]  and we damage our relationship
[1597.30 --> 1597.92]  with you Lord
[1597.92 --> 1599.56]  you don't walk away
[1599.56 --> 1601.90]  but Lord you pursue us.
[1602.62 --> 1603.88]  You pursue us in your love
[1603.88 --> 1605.76]  in your steadfast
[1605.76 --> 1606.68]  mercy
[1606.68 --> 1607.92]  and grace to us.
[1609.08 --> 1609.92]  So Lord
[1609.92 --> 1610.82]  help us
[1610.82 --> 1612.12]  each and every day
[1612.12 --> 1613.44]  to open our hearts to you
[1613.44 --> 1614.84]  and to find the deepest
[1614.84 --> 1616.02]  longings of our heart
[1616.02 --> 1616.70]  in you alone.
[1617.70 --> 1619.30]  Lord we thank you again
[1619.30 --> 1620.78]  Lord that you forgive us
[1620.78 --> 1621.48]  of our sins.
[1621.60 --> 1622.42]  Whatever they are
[1622.42 --> 1623.12]  you know them
[1623.12 --> 1624.80]  and for each one
[1624.80 --> 1625.92]  of them
[1625.92 --> 1626.76]  you have died
[1626.76 --> 1628.10]  and paid the penalty.
[1628.98 --> 1629.58]  Lord we thank you
[1629.58 --> 1630.18]  for the forgiveness
[1630.18 --> 1631.44]  that you offer to us.
[1632.24 --> 1632.80]  We thank you
[1632.80 --> 1633.30]  and praise you
[1633.30 --> 1634.04]  in Jesus name.
[1634.22 --> 1634.54]  Amen.
[1636.16 --> 1636.52]  Friends
[1636.52 --> 1637.56]  if you have placed
[1637.56 --> 1638.72]  your faith in Jesus Christ
[1638.72 --> 1639.96]  as your only source
[1639.96 --> 1640.62]  of salvation
[1640.62 --> 1641.24]  and hope
[1641.24 --> 1642.68]  the only one
[1642.68 --> 1643.54]  who can remove
[1643.54 --> 1644.22]  your sin
[1644.22 --> 1644.76]  and shame
[1644.76 --> 1645.46]  before God
[1645.46 --> 1646.56]  we can know
[1646.56 --> 1648.12]  that he forgives us
[1648.12 --> 1649.82]  as we turn to him
[1649.82 --> 1650.76]  again and again.
[1651.80 --> 1652.60]  Isaiah the prophet
[1652.60 --> 1653.68]  says this about
[1653.68 --> 1654.88]  God's readiness
[1654.88 --> 1655.92]  to forgive.
[1656.72 --> 1657.38]  He says this
[1657.38 --> 1658.18]  in Isaiah 30
[1658.18 --> 1659.62]  the Lord
[1659.62 --> 1660.88]  longs
[1660.88 --> 1661.92]  to be gracious
[1661.92 --> 1662.42]  to you
[1662.42 --> 1663.38]  therefore
[1663.38 --> 1664.78]  he will rise up
[1664.78 --> 1666.20]  to show you
[1666.20 --> 1666.94]  compassion.
[1668.02 --> 1669.20]  He will surely
[1669.20 --> 1670.34]  be gracious to you
[1670.34 --> 1671.52]  at the sound
[1671.52 --> 1672.34]  of your cry
[1672.34 --> 1673.32]  as soon as
[1673.32 --> 1674.08]  he hears it
[1674.08 --> 1675.60]  he answers you.
[1676.70 --> 1677.54]  Praise him
[1677.54 --> 1678.90]  for this wonderful promise.
[1679.78 --> 1681.20]  Let's respond
[1681.20 --> 1682.24]  to these promises
[1682.24 --> 1683.12]  now in song.
[1683.22 --> 1683.56]  I invite you
[1683.56 --> 1684.16]  to stand again
[1684.16 --> 1684.66]  and we'll sing
[1684.66 --> 1686.06]  a song of response.
[1686.18 --> 1687.46]  Salvation belongs
[1687.46 --> 1688.26]  to our God.
[1688.26 --> 1702.00]  salvation belongs
[1702.00 --> 1705.00]  to our God
[1705.00 --> 1708.78]  who sits upon
[1708.78 --> 1710.24]  the floor
[1710.24 --> 1715.98]  and to the land
[1715.98 --> 1717.80]  and to the land
[1717.80 --> 1720.56]  praise and glory
[1720.56 --> 1723.70]  wisdom and grace
[1723.70 --> 1726.28]  honor and power
[1726.28 --> 1727.98]  and strength
[1727.98 --> 1732.26]  be to our God
[1732.26 --> 1735.02]  forever and ever
[1735.02 --> 1737.70]  be to our God
[1737.70 --> 1740.42]  forever and ever
[1740.42 --> 1743.48]  be to our God
[1743.48 --> 1746.24]  forever and ever
[1746.24 --> 1747.76]  amen
[1747.76 --> 1755.06]  and we the ring
[1755.06 --> 1757.16]  shall be strong
[1757.16 --> 1760.90]  in purpose
[1760.90 --> 1763.90]  and unity
[1763.90 --> 1767.04]  declaring
[1767.04 --> 1769.16]  the love
[1769.16 --> 1773.04]  praise and glory
[1773.04 --> 1776.26]  wisdom and thanks
[1776.26 --> 1778.84]  honor and power
[1778.84 --> 1781.58]  and strength
[1781.58 --> 1784.74]  be to our God
[1784.74 --> 1787.64]  forever and ever
[1787.64 --> 1790.48]  be to our God
[1790.48 --> 1793.30]  forever and ever
[1793.30 --> 1796.04]  be to our God
[1796.04 --> 1799.20]  forever and ever
[1799.20 --> 1800.20]  amen
[1800.20 --> 1826.48]  brothers and sisters
[1826.48 --> 1828.06]  before we come to this table
[1828.06 --> 1828.58]  together
[1828.58 --> 1829.86]  we proclaim
[1829.86 --> 1830.98]  our faith
[1830.98 --> 1832.30]  the one faith
[1832.30 --> 1833.54]  that we share
[1833.54 --> 1834.38]  because of our
[1834.38 --> 1835.06]  one baptism
[1835.06 --> 1835.98]  our one Lord
[1835.98 --> 1837.18]  and one Father
[1837.18 --> 1837.70]  of all
[1837.70 --> 1838.48]  who is over all
[1838.48 --> 1838.98]  and in all
[1838.98 --> 1839.66]  and through all
[1839.66 --> 1841.40]  our confession of faith
[1841.40 --> 1842.04]  is from
[1842.04 --> 1843.36]  the Heidelberg Catechism
[1843.36 --> 1844.66]  question and answer
[1844.66 --> 1845.54]  60
[1845.54 --> 1847.54]  it's on the screen here
[1847.54 --> 1849.18]  and I want to
[1849.18 --> 1850.14]  invite us all
[1850.14 --> 1850.54]  to
[1850.54 --> 1851.78]  to confess
[1851.78 --> 1852.60]  this together
[1852.60 --> 1853.34]  and I will ask
[1853.34 --> 1853.78]  the question
[1853.78 --> 1855.26]  how are you
[1855.26 --> 1856.32]  righteous before God
[1856.32 --> 1860.06]  only by true faith
[1860.06 --> 1861.54]  in Jesus Christ
[1861.54 --> 1863.86]  even though
[1863.86 --> 1864.80]  my conscience
[1864.80 --> 1866.04]  accuses me
[1866.04 --> 1867.00]  of having
[1867.00 --> 1867.70]  grievously
[1867.70 --> 1868.44]  sinned
[1868.44 --> 1869.60]  against all
[1869.60 --> 1870.80]  God's commandments
[1870.80 --> 1872.80]  of never
[1872.80 --> 1873.66]  having kept
[1873.66 --> 1874.44]  any of them
[1874.44 --> 1875.86]  and of still
[1875.86 --> 1877.06]  being inclined
[1877.06 --> 1878.18]  toward all
[1878.18 --> 1878.66]  evil
[1878.66 --> 1880.54]  nevertheless
[1880.54 --> 1882.38]  without any
[1882.38 --> 1883.86]  merit of my own
[1883.86 --> 1885.84]  out of sheer grace
[1885.84 --> 1887.48]  God grants
[1887.48 --> 1888.30]  and credits
[1888.30 --> 1889.14]  to me
[1889.14 --> 1890.32]  the perfect
[1890.32 --> 1891.28]  satisfaction
[1891.28 --> 1892.52]  righteousness
[1892.52 --> 1894.02]  and holiness
[1894.02 --> 1895.20]  of Christ
[1895.20 --> 1896.74]  as if
[1896.74 --> 1897.60]  I had never
[1897.60 --> 1898.68]  sinned
[1898.68 --> 1899.46]  nor been
[1899.46 --> 1900.08]  a sinner
[1900.08 --> 1901.98]  and as if
[1901.98 --> 1902.84]  I had been
[1902.84 --> 1903.70]  as perfectly
[1903.70 --> 1904.36]  obedient
[1904.36 --> 1905.78]  as Christ
[1905.78 --> 1906.60]  was obedient
[1906.60 --> 1907.64]  for me
[1907.64 --> 1909.74]  all I need
[1909.74 --> 1910.28]  to do
[1910.28 --> 1911.32]  is accept
[1911.32 --> 1912.16]  this gift
[1912.16 --> 1913.32]  with a believing
[1913.32 --> 1913.76]  heart
[1913.76 --> 1916.02]  you know
[1916.02 --> 1916.78]  this meal
[1916.78 --> 1918.96]  is one way
[1918.96 --> 1919.50]  that we
[1919.50 --> 1920.22]  accept this
[1920.22 --> 1920.54]  gift
[1920.54 --> 1921.14]  with a believing
[1921.14 --> 1921.54]  heart
[1921.54 --> 1923.18]  because this
[1923.18 --> 1924.38]  meal communicates
[1924.38 --> 1925.10]  to us
[1925.10 --> 1926.10]  who Jesus is
[1926.10 --> 1926.98]  and what
[1926.98 --> 1927.86]  he has done
[1927.86 --> 1928.44]  for us
[1928.44 --> 1930.22]  this meal
[1930.22 --> 1931.08]  is for those
[1931.08 --> 1932.04]  who have
[1932.04 --> 1932.46]  accepted
[1932.46 --> 1933.46]  this great
[1933.46 --> 1933.72]  gift
[1933.72 --> 1934.16]  accepted
[1934.16 --> 1934.86]  the righteousness
[1934.86 --> 1935.54]  of our Lord
[1935.54 --> 1935.92]  Jesus
[1935.92 --> 1937.38]  it's for those
[1937.38 --> 1937.80]  who have been
[1937.80 --> 1938.86]  baptized in his
[1938.86 --> 1939.20]  name
[1939.20 --> 1940.22]  it is for
[1940.22 --> 1940.76]  sinners
[1940.76 --> 1941.74]  me
[1941.74 --> 1942.74]  and you
[1942.74 --> 1944.82]  and it
[1944.82 --> 1945.58]  is for us
[1945.58 --> 1946.26]  who though
[1946.26 --> 1947.08]  we sin
[1947.08 --> 1947.74]  we put our
[1947.74 --> 1948.20]  faith in
[1948.20 --> 1948.92]  Jesus Christ
[1948.92 --> 1949.28]  and his
[1949.28 --> 1949.70]  grace
[1949.70 --> 1950.66]  and friends
[1950.66 --> 1951.14]  it is a
[1951.14 --> 1951.74]  foretaste
[1951.74 --> 1952.02]  of the
[1952.02 --> 1952.52]  communion
[1952.52 --> 1952.92]  that we
[1952.92 --> 1953.44]  all long
[1953.44 --> 1953.80]  for
[1953.80 --> 1954.68]  communion
[1954.68 --> 1955.62]  to be
[1955.62 --> 1956.04]  with our
[1956.04 --> 1956.34]  God
[1956.34 --> 1956.64]  who has
[1956.64 --> 1957.30]  created us
[1957.30 --> 1958.00]  and loved
[1958.00 --> 1958.22]  us
[1958.22 --> 1959.18]  which we
[1959.18 --> 1959.44]  will
[1959.44 --> 1959.96]  experience
[1959.96 --> 1960.34]  in all
[1960.34 --> 1960.56]  of its
[1960.56 --> 1960.84]  fullness
[1960.84 --> 1961.88]  when Christ
[1961.88 --> 1962.42]  returns
[1962.42 --> 1963.66]  so if
[1963.66 --> 1963.94]  you are
[1963.94 --> 1964.24]  here
[1964.24 --> 1964.52]  and you
[1964.52 --> 1964.88]  are not
[1964.88 --> 1965.30]  yet a
[1965.30 --> 1965.64]  Christian
[1965.64 --> 1966.98]  this meal
[1966.98 --> 1967.26]  is not
[1967.26 --> 1967.72]  yet for
[1967.72 --> 1967.94]  you
[1967.94 --> 1968.62]  but yet
[1968.62 --> 1969.34]  we invite
[1969.34 --> 1969.64]  you
[1969.64 --> 1971.10]  to stay
[1971.10 --> 1971.52]  with us
[1971.52 --> 1971.96]  and to
[1971.96 --> 1972.64]  meditate
[1972.64 --> 1973.56]  upon Christ's
[1973.56 --> 1973.92]  promises
[1973.92 --> 1974.62]  and consider
[1974.62 --> 1975.64]  his gift
[1975.64 --> 1976.04]  of love
[1976.04 --> 1976.78]  and grace
[1976.78 --> 1977.36]  to you
[1977.36 --> 1980.34]  so friends
[1980.34 --> 1980.84]  hear these
[1980.84 --> 1981.64]  words now
[1981.64 --> 1982.58]  of the
[1982.58 --> 1983.02]  words of
[1983.02 --> 1983.54]  institution
[1983.54 --> 1984.06]  from the
[1984.06 --> 1985.10]  apostle Paul
[1985.10 --> 1985.46]  which he
[1985.46 --> 1985.88]  received
[1985.88 --> 1986.22]  from our
[1986.22 --> 1986.42]  Lord
[1986.42 --> 1986.68]  Jesus
[1986.68 --> 1987.24]  Christ
[1987.24 --> 1988.68]  Paul said
[1988.68 --> 1989.14]  the Lord
[1989.14 --> 1989.66]  on the night
[1989.66 --> 1990.16]  when he was
[1990.16 --> 1990.54]  betrayed
[1990.54 --> 1991.24]  took bread
[1991.24 --> 1992.54]  and when he
[1992.54 --> 1992.92]  had given
[1992.92 --> 1993.40]  thanks
[1993.40 --> 1993.92]  he broke
[1993.92 --> 1994.22]  it
[1994.22 --> 1995.10]  and he
[1995.10 --> 1995.34]  said
[1995.34 --> 1995.72]  this is
[1995.72 --> 1996.26]  my body
[1996.26 --> 1996.68]  which is
[1996.68 --> 1997.16]  for you
[1997.16 --> 1998.36]  do this
[1998.36 --> 1999.36]  in remembrance
[1999.36 --> 2000.22]  of me
[2000.22 --> 2002.78]  in the same
[2002.78 --> 2003.10]  way
[2003.10 --> 2004.14]  after supper
[2004.14 --> 2004.82]  he took
[2004.82 --> 2005.28]  the cup
[2005.28 --> 2005.60]  saying
[2005.60 --> 2006.12]  this cup
[2006.12 --> 2006.44]  is a
[2006.44 --> 2006.82]  covenant
[2006.82 --> 2007.78]  in my
[2007.78 --> 2008.16]  blood
[2008.16 --> 2009.14]  do this
[2009.14 --> 2009.68]  whenever you
[2009.68 --> 2010.22]  drink it
[2010.22 --> 2011.40]  in remembrance
[2011.40 --> 2012.50]  of me
[2012.50 --> 2013.56]  for as
[2013.56 --> 2013.90]  often
[2013.90 --> 2014.92]  as you
[2014.92 --> 2015.48]  eat this
[2015.48 --> 2015.90]  bread
[2015.90 --> 2016.78]  and drink
[2016.78 --> 2017.34]  this cup
[2017.34 --> 2017.50]  you
[2017.50 --> 2018.04]  proclaim
[2018.04 --> 2018.42]  the
[2018.42 --> 2018.74]  Lord's
[2018.74 --> 2018.98]  death
[2018.98 --> 2019.82]  until
[2019.82 --> 2020.18]  he
[2020.18 --> 2020.86]  comes

[2033.60 --> 2034.02]  people
[2034.02 --> 2037.40]  let us
[2037.40 --> 2038.00]  proclaim
[2038.00 --> 2038.82]  the mystery
[2038.82 --> 2039.46]  of faith
[2039.46 --> 2040.66]  Christ
[2040.66 --> 2041.34]  has died
[2041.34 --> 2042.06]  Christ
[2042.06 --> 2042.70]  is risen
[2042.70 --> 2043.58]  Christ
[2043.58 --> 2044.24]  will come
[2044.24 --> 2044.66]  again
[2044.66 --> 2045.62]  Christ
[2045.62 --> 2045.90]  our
[2045.90 --> 2046.44]  Passover
[2046.44 --> 2046.90]  has been
[2046.90 --> 2047.34]  sacrificed
[2047.34 --> 2047.94]  for us
[2047.94 --> 2048.76]  hallelujah
[2048.76 --> 2050.54]  friends
[2050.54 --> 2051.08]  these are
[2051.08 --> 2051.62]  the gifts
[2051.62 --> 2052.08]  of God
[2052.08 --> 2052.86]  for you

[2055.82 --> 2056.44]  on him
[2056.44 --> 2057.44]  in your
[2057.44 --> 2057.92]  hearts
[2057.92 --> 2058.78]  by faith
[2058.78 --> 2059.58]  with thanksgiving
[2059.58 --> 2060.28]  knowing
[2060.28 --> 2060.84]  and trusting
[2060.84 --> 2061.56]  and believing
[2061.56 --> 2062.88]  the gospel

[2523.62 --> 2527.54]  Father, we give you great praise and thanks.
[2527.54 --> 2532.48]  though we do not deserve it in any stretch of the imagination,
[2533.58 --> 2535.84]  but Lord, simply out of who you are,
[2536.80 --> 2539.24]  your great love and your mercy, Lord,
[2539.36 --> 2542.96]  you came and accomplished the salvation of your people.
[2543.96 --> 2546.64]  And you saved us and you made us alive
[2546.64 --> 2547.78]  and you drew us to yourself
[2547.78 --> 2550.76]  and you united us with the triune God,
[2550.98 --> 2551.84]  Father, Son, and Spirit,
[2552.36 --> 2554.68]  that we might be your body in this world.
[2555.68 --> 2559.74]  Lord, we thank you for uniting us to yourself
[2559.74 --> 2562.52]  and Lord, for also the grace of this sacrament
[2562.52 --> 2566.60]  by which you strengthen us by your grace,
[2566.82 --> 2568.68]  Lord, to be your people in this world.
[2570.26 --> 2572.42]  Lord, go with us and strengthen us,
[2572.86 --> 2574.92]  Lord, even later as you send us out from here
[2574.92 --> 2578.74]  because of this meal that you have fed us with.
[2578.94 --> 2580.54]  We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[2584.68 --> 2585.68]  Amen.
[2585.68 --> 2586.68]  Amen.
[2586.68 --> 2587.68]  Amen.

[2597.12 --> 2599.48]  for a little message.
[2599.48 --> 2599.58]  Amen.

[2611.64 --> 2612.64]  Amen.
[2612.64 --> 2614.64]  Amen.
[2614.64 --> 2619.26]  People have to go
[2619.26 --> 2620.70]  Hello.
[2620.70 --> 2620.80]  Hello.
[2620.80 --> 2622.88]  Hello.
[2625.82 --> 2627.76]  Well, I just get more of you than I thought.
[2629.60 --> 2631.30]  Come on up.
[2633.30 --> 2635.12]  All right.
[2640.86 --> 2641.72]  There we are.
[2641.72 --> 2642.72]  Look at all those things up there, right?
[2642.72 --> 2653.26]  Okay, nice to see you all. So, how are you today? Good. Who knows what this is? Can you
[2653.26 --> 2660.66]  all see this? Is it a fish? You see it's a fish? And what do you say? A piggy bank.
[2660.76 --> 2664.24]  It is a kind of piggy bank. You know, what do you do with a piggy bank? You store money.
[2664.38 --> 2669.92]  But this is a fishy bank. You know, fishy bank. Fishy bank. See, fishy bank. So you put your
[2669.92 --> 2675.10]  dollar bills, your coins on there. And they don't fall out the bottom because there's
[2675.10 --> 2681.88]  a plug. And when you think, when you see a fish, does this remind you of any story from
[2681.88 --> 2688.82]  the Bible that you can think of? You know? What do you think? When a big fish swallowed
[2688.82 --> 2699.04]  Jonah. Yeah, that's a good one. How about, do you have one? Yeah, perfect. And creation
[2699.04 --> 2703.28]  God made the animals and he also made the fish. You guys are so smart. Does anybody
[2703.28 --> 2706.04]  have one? There's one more I'm thinking of though. Do you know? What did Jesus do with
[2706.04 --> 2712.86]  some fish? He split it up to feed everyone. Do you guys remember that story? So there is
[2712.86 --> 2718.76]  a huge crowd of people. They were following Jesus. Jesus was healing them and helping them.
[2719.06 --> 2724.74]  And he was telling them about God's kingdom. And one time they were up on this hill. There
[2724.74 --> 2730.54]  were lots of people. And it was dinner time. And no one had made dinner. Everyone was going
[2730.54 --> 2737.78]  to be so hungry. So Jesus told his disciples, you feed all the people. But they said, we don't
[2737.78 --> 2741.64]  have any food. How are we going to feed all these people? We don't have any food. And you
[2741.64 --> 2748.88]  know what? A little boy came up. You know? A little boy. And what did the boy have? He
[2748.88 --> 2757.56]  had five loaves of bread and how many fish? Two, I think. Yeah, he had two. Two fish.
[2757.78 --> 2764.78]  Two little fish. And what did Jesus do with these two fish? Two little fish, five loaves
[2764.78 --> 2770.56]  of bread. How could he feed all these people? But what Jesus did was he multiplied it. He
[2770.56 --> 2776.26]  fed everybody and everybody was full. But here's an important thing is that Jesus wouldn't have
[2776.26 --> 2784.16]  been able to do that unless a little boy shared what he had. So we're going to do something.
[2784.94 --> 2793.00]  We, I want to invite us to share what we have. Okay? So in a month's time is Thanksgiving.
[2793.64 --> 2798.24]  Do you all know Thanksgiving? So what I want to invite you to do is we have, see that bin
[2798.24 --> 2804.96]  right there? I have lots of fish. And I want to give one fish to each house. Yes?
[2807.72 --> 2815.14]  You have this one? Oh, cool. Okay. Well, so if you don't have one, I want to give you a
[2815.14 --> 2821.08]  fish and we're going to put some money. Maybe you get allowance. Maybe you get some money
[2821.08 --> 2826.46]  and you can share a little bit of money. You can keep some for yourself and you can share
[2826.46 --> 2830.54]  some. And you put it in and on Thanksgiving, we're going to bring it back and we're going
[2830.54 --> 2833.40]  to see how much we have. And what we're going to do with this money, we're going to make
[2833.40 --> 2838.42]  sure someone else can eat. We're going to, we're going to support a family who doesn't
[2838.42 --> 2841.96]  have enough food and we're going to give it to them so that they can eat. Just like in
[2841.96 --> 2846.58]  the story, the little boy brought what he had and God used it to multiply and feed people.
[2847.10 --> 2852.72]  So we can do the same thing. Okay? Sound good? Awesome. Okay. Let's pray.
[2852.72 --> 2858.92]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you can take our gifts, what we have to offer, and
[2858.92 --> 2863.32]  you can use it, Lord, for the work of your kingdom. Lord, help each of us be willing and
[2863.32 --> 2869.40]  able to offer what we have. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Okay, so come get a fish. And
[2869.40 --> 2872.86]  you have to remember, you have to put some coins in there. Talk to your parents about that.
[2873.80 --> 2874.16]  Okay.
[2876.16 --> 2877.50]  I have a lot.
[2877.92 --> 2880.60]  Well, just share what we think God wants you to share.
[2880.60 --> 2881.88]  I don't even have any.
[2882.74 --> 2886.28]  Oh, oh. Oh, no. Uh-oh.
[2890.02 --> 2895.32]  You can go back to your seats. Yep. Your house has one. Let's see. Just, just, not one per
[2895.32 --> 2896.52]  person. You guys should share, right?
[2898.00 --> 2903.24]  Do you want to take this one? You can still take it. You do.
[2903.24 --> 2904.66]  It has money in there.
[2904.74 --> 2906.34]  Oh, cool. There you go.
[2906.34 --> 2921.16]  Okay. There's enough. Are you okay? Can you guys share together? Okay. Do you have
[2921.16 --> 2926.50]  one? Okay. Yeah, cool. All right. Here we go. Okay. All right. Everyone go back to your
[2926.50 --> 2934.02]  seats. Can you guys share one? Here. We have one here. Take another one. There you go.
[2934.02 --> 2934.42]  Okay.
[2934.42 --> 2934.46]  Okay.
[2945.28 --> 2951.18]  So our scripture passage this morning, what we'd like to invite you to do when we are going
[2951.18 --> 2958.12]  to read from the Bible is to actually take your pew Bible out and follow along in your Bible.
[2958.12 --> 2970.12]  And the passage is on page 870 and is found in Ephesians 4, starting at verse 7. So page
[2970.12 --> 2977.04]  870 in your pew Bible, Ephesians 4, verse 7 to 16.
[2977.04 --> 2979.04]  So page 870 in your pew.
[2979.04 --> 2980.04]  And the passage is found in Ephesians 4, verse 8. So page 8, verse 8, verse 9.
[2980.04 --> 2990.04]  But to each one of us, grace has been given as Christ appointed it. This is why it says,
[2990.04 --> 2999.10]  when he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people. What does he ascended
[2999.10 --> 3007.02]  mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions? He who descended is the
[3007.02 --> 3014.02]  very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe. So Christ
[3014.02 --> 3022.02]  himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers to equip
[3022.02 --> 3029.02]  his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach
[3029.02 --> 3036.02]  unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to
[3036.02 --> 3043.02]  the whole measure of fullness in Christ. Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and
[3043.02 --> 3049.02]  forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and
[3049.02 --> 3054.02]  craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become
[3054.02 --> 3079.02]  in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work. This is the word of the Lord.
[3079.02 --> 3106.02]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3106.02 --> 3132.02]  Will you please join me in prayer? Let's pray. Our Father, as we come to this passage of your word, a passage that is rich and full, I pray that we might have our hearts tugged and pulled by you, towards you and towards each other, towards this family, this body, this kingdom, this temple that you have made called your church.
[3132.02 --> 3136.02]  And in so doing, Lord, would you bring honor and glory to Jesus, our head.
[3136.02 --> 3139.02]  It is in his name we pray. Amen.
[3139.02 --> 3146.02]  Well, what would you think if someone new came to our church and they said,
[3146.02 --> 3150.02]  I am God's gift to this church?
[3150.02 --> 3153.02]  That's a pretty bold statement, isn't it?
[3153.02 --> 3162.02]  And depending on how they said it and then what they were up to, it might not be a good thing to say.
[3162.02 --> 3166.02]  You know, it could be pride and arrogance.
[3166.02 --> 3177.02]  But technically speaking, if we follow what Paul is saying here, that statement is absolutely true.
[3177.02 --> 3184.02]  God gives gifts to his church and Ephesians says that those gifts are people.
[3184.02 --> 3197.02]  So if you're a Christian, if you're God's child, God has given you with all of your personality and your abilities and your experiences to the church.
[3197.02 --> 3198.02]  Right?
[3198.02 --> 3201.02]  You are a gift to the church.
[3201.02 --> 3206.02]  So I want you to, I don't do this very often, but here we go.
[3206.02 --> 3213.02]  I want you to turn to the person near to you and say to them, I am God's gift to this church.
[3213.02 --> 3214.02]  Please.
[3222.02 --> 3224.02]  Do you believe it?
[3224.02 --> 3225.02]  Do you believe it for yourself?
[3225.02 --> 3227.02]  Do you think you are God's gift to this church?
[3227.02 --> 3230.02]  Do you believe the person who said it to you?
[3230.02 --> 3231.02]  You are.
[3231.02 --> 3232.02]  You are.
[3232.02 --> 3235.02]  You are God's gift to this church.
[3235.02 --> 3242.02]  Now this passage in Ephesians 4 is following a section we looked at a few weeks ago about the need for unity.
[3242.02 --> 3243.02]  Right?
[3243.02 --> 3245.02]  We need to be together as the church.
[3245.02 --> 3248.02]  We need to have a common profession of faith.
[3248.02 --> 3249.02]  There's one faith.
[3249.02 --> 3250.02]  There's one Lord.
[3250.02 --> 3251.02]  There's one baptism.
[3251.02 --> 3255.02]  Because there is one body, one spirit, and one Father of all.
[3255.02 --> 3265.02]  And now in verses 7 to 16, Paul is explaining the practical way that this unity is achieved.
[3265.02 --> 3269.02]  The way that God actually builds this house as one.
[3269.02 --> 3273.02]  And he does it through giving gifts to the church.
[3273.02 --> 3282.02]  And so this morning I'd like us to see that Christ is building his church very practically through the gifts of his people.
[3282.02 --> 3284.02]  And there are three things I want to look at this morning.
[3284.02 --> 3285.02]  Three simple things.
[3285.02 --> 3287.02]  First, just the giver of the gifts.
[3287.02 --> 3288.02]  Who's the giver?
[3288.02 --> 3291.02]  And then secondly, the gifts themselves.
[3291.02 --> 3292.02]  What gifts does God give?
[3292.02 --> 3295.02]  And then thirdly, what is the goal?
[3295.02 --> 3297.02]  What is the goal of these gifts?
[3297.02 --> 3299.02]  Okay, what are they given to achieve?
[3299.02 --> 3301.02]  So that's how we're going to look at this passage together.
[3301.02 --> 3304.02]  So first, the giver of the gifts.
[3304.02 --> 3307.02]  So if you have your Bibles open, but we'll also have it on the screen.
[3307.02 --> 3310.02]  Look at verses 7 and 8.
[3310.02 --> 3312.02]  Paul writes,
[3312.02 --> 3319.02]  But to each one of us, grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
[3319.02 --> 3323.02]  So God's going to give different gifts to the church by his grace.
[3323.02 --> 3326.02]  Then in verse 8, he says,
[3326.02 --> 3328.02]  This is why it says,
[3328.02 --> 3335.02]  When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.
[3335.02 --> 3340.02]  Now, I need to take a moment to talk about what's happening here.
[3340.02 --> 3342.02]  This is a quote from the Old Testament.
[3342.02 --> 3344.02]  It's from Psalm 68.
[3344.02 --> 3350.02]  And it's a picture of something that would have been well known and understood in Paul's day.
[3350.02 --> 3356.02]  Because it's a picture of an ancient Near Eastern victory march.
[3356.02 --> 3357.02]  A triumph.
[3357.02 --> 3362.02]  A king would ride out into battle.
[3362.02 --> 3371.02]  And after the king wins the battle, he comes back to the city victorious with all of the spoils of war.
[3371.02 --> 3372.02]  Right?
[3372.02 --> 3374.02]  And so he would have all this gold.
[3374.02 --> 3383.02]  He'd have all this plunder, you know, weapons and jewels that he has taken as well as captives.
[3383.02 --> 3387.02]  So in a sense, it's not a very nice picture.
[3387.02 --> 3391.02]  The king would conquer a city and lead everyone else out as slaves.
[3391.02 --> 3393.02]  They would be captives of war.
[3393.02 --> 3401.02]  And as the king comes back to the city, though, the people are celebrating and praising and rejoicing in the victory of the king.
[3401.02 --> 3403.02]  So that's the picture.
[3403.02 --> 3407.02]  And then in verses 9 and 10, Paul gives his commentary.
[3407.02 --> 3410.02]  So you see in our passage, it's kind of parentheses off.
[3410.02 --> 3413.02]  So here's what it says in verse 9 and 10.
[3413.02 --> 3415.02]  It says,
[3415.02 --> 3420.02]  Now what does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?
[3420.02 --> 3427.02]  He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe.
[3427.02 --> 3436.02]  So what Paul is doing here is he is applying this imagery of a conquering king to Jesus.
[3436.02 --> 3444.02]  He writes about the glorious victory of Jesus, who has gone into the places of darkness and rescued out his people.
[3444.02 --> 3448.02]  Jesus descended, didn't he?
[3448.02 --> 3451.02]  He descended in the incarnation when he became a man and took on flesh.
[3451.02 --> 3453.02]  He died on the cross.
[3453.02 --> 3457.02]  He defeated our enemies of sin, death, and the devil.
[3457.02 --> 3462.02]  And then he rose again from the dead and he ascended to his throne in heaven.
[3462.02 --> 3465.02]  He is the conquering, returning king.
[3465.02 --> 3475.02]  So here Jesus is at the head of this glorious victory march, coming in with all of these captives, all of the people he's taken.
[3475.02 --> 3479.02]  Now the question is, who are the captives?
[3479.02 --> 3482.02]  I read some commentaries this week.
[3482.02 --> 3484.02]  There are several options.
[3484.02 --> 3492.02]  Some people say, well, it is all of the forces of evil, the principalities and powers that Christ has conquered.
[3492.02 --> 3495.02]  There's some textual evidence for that.
[3495.02 --> 3496.02]  But here's what I think.
[3496.02 --> 3498.02]  I think this fits better.
[3498.02 --> 3503.02]  I believe that they are the people whom Christ has won for himself.
[3503.02 --> 3507.02]  In other words, his captives are his people, the church.
[3507.02 --> 3513.02]  That he has just rescued from the hands of his enemy who had bound them in sin and darkness.
[3513.02 --> 3518.02]  Because look, earlier in Ephesians chapter 2, Paul says this.
[3518.02 --> 3519.02]  Let's look in.
[3519.02 --> 3524.02]  If you have your Bibles, you want to turn to chapter 2, verses 1 to 2.
[3524.02 --> 3528.02]  You can see, you know, in the context of the letter, what Paul is talking about.
[3528.02 --> 3530.02]  So he says this, and we've looked at this before.
[3530.02 --> 3544.02]  As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
[3544.02 --> 3549.02]  So what Paul is saying here is that we used to follow the devil.
[3549.02 --> 3551.02]  We used to serve the prince of the power of the air.
[3551.02 --> 3552.02]  That's another name for the devil.
[3552.02 --> 3554.02]  We were children of disobedience.
[3554.02 --> 3556.02]  We were bound in sin and death.
[3556.02 --> 3559.02]  But Christ came and he robbed Satan.
[3559.02 --> 3561.02]  Satan owned us.
[3561.02 --> 3563.02]  We served him.
[3563.02 --> 3565.02]  Christ stole us away from Satan.
[3565.02 --> 3569.02]  Or to use another metaphor, he busted us out of prison.
[3569.02 --> 3570.02]  Right?
[3570.02 --> 3571.02]  He broke us out.
[3571.02 --> 3577.02]  He transferred us from this kingdom of darkness into his kingdom of light.
[3577.02 --> 3581.02]  So look in verses 4 and 5 in chapter 2.
[3581.02 --> 3583.02]  He keeps going.
[3583.02 --> 3584.02]  He says,
[3584.02 --> 3589.02]  But because of his great love for us, God who is rich in mercy made us alive with Christ.
[3589.02 --> 3593.02]  Even when we were dead in transgressions, it is by grace you have been saved.
[3593.02 --> 3596.02]  God raised us up with Christ and did what?
[3596.02 --> 3601.02]  Seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.
[3601.02 --> 3605.02]  Okay, so friends, Jesus is our king.
[3605.02 --> 3607.02]  He is our conquering king.
[3607.02 --> 3609.02]  He fights our battles for us.
[3609.02 --> 3610.02]  He goes to battle.
[3610.02 --> 3611.02]  He rescues us.
[3611.02 --> 3614.02]  He conquers our enemies of sin and death.
[3614.02 --> 3617.02]  And he leads us out as captives in his train.
[3617.02 --> 3621.02]  And then he does something that no other earthly king would do.
[3621.02 --> 3623.02]  He sets us free.
[3623.02 --> 3626.02]  And then he turns around these captives and says,
[3626.02 --> 3628.02]  You are my people now.
[3628.02 --> 3632.02]  And he gives us back into his kingdom.
[3632.02 --> 3635.02]  Think about the apostle Paul.
[3635.02 --> 3640.02]  Previously, Paul was persecuting the church.
[3640.02 --> 3642.02]  He was an enemy of God.
[3642.02 --> 3645.02]  And Christ dies for Paul.
[3645.02 --> 3646.02]  He rises again.
[3646.02 --> 3651.02]  And then when Paul is on the road to Damascus, Christ appears to him.
[3651.02 --> 3653.02]  He meets Paul on the road.
[3653.02 --> 3655.02]  And Paul says, Who are you?
[3656.02 --> 3660.02]  And Jesus says, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
[3660.02 --> 3663.02]  And then Jesus captures him.
[3663.02 --> 3666.02]  And now he turns him into Paul the apostle.
[3666.02 --> 3671.02]  And says, I am going to give you as a gift to the church.
[3671.02 --> 3674.02]  You are going to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.
[3674.02 --> 3678.02]  People are going to come to understand the mystery of the gospel through you.
[3678.02 --> 3682.02]  You who were formerly an enemy who I have captured.
[3682.02 --> 3686.02]  And I have made you a servant of me to serve me.
[3686.02 --> 3689.02]  And friends, this is how Paul understood himself.
[3689.02 --> 3693.02]  Look at what he says in 2 Corinthians 2, verse 14.
[3693.02 --> 3695.02]  You don't have to, we'll put it here.
[3695.02 --> 3696.02]  It says this,
[3696.02 --> 3700.02]  But thanks be to God who always leads us as what?
[3700.02 --> 3705.02]  Captives in Christ's triumphal procession.
[3705.02 --> 3706.02]  That's the victory march.
[3706.02 --> 3711.02]  And he uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
[3711.02 --> 3712.02]  That's the image.
[3712.02 --> 3714.02]  We are in Christ's triumphal procession.
[3714.02 --> 3717.02]  We are his captives.
[3717.02 --> 3718.02]  Jesus descends.
[3718.02 --> 3721.02]  He wins the victory over sin and death for us on the cross.
[3721.02 --> 3722.02]  He captures us.
[3722.02 --> 3723.02]  He makes us his own.
[3723.02 --> 3730.02]  And then amazingly, he begins to use us for the building up of the body, the work of ministry.
[3730.02 --> 3732.02]  Friends, this is absolutely incredible.
[3732.02 --> 3740.02]  Do you know, this morning, that if you are a Christian, you have been won by Christ?
[3740.02 --> 3743.02]  You belong to him.
[3743.02 --> 3745.02]  He has purchased you with his blood.
[3745.02 --> 3750.02]  The king who has come to fight our battle, he has set us free.
[3750.02 --> 3753.02]  He returns to heaven with you and me.
[3753.02 --> 3756.02]  And he wants to use us now for his kingdom.
[3756.02 --> 3760.02]  Friends, that brings us to the second thing we see here,
[3760.02 --> 3763.02]  which is the gifts themselves.
[3763.02 --> 3767.02]  Okay, Paul emphasizes in this passage a few particular gifts.
[3767.02 --> 3769.02]  So let's look at verse 11.
[3769.02 --> 3773.02]  What are the gifts that Christ himself gives?
[3773.02 --> 3776.02]  It says Christ himself gave, there's that word,
[3776.02 --> 3781.02]  the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers.
[3781.02 --> 3787.02]  Okay, so Paul here is giving us some examples of some of the kinds of people that he gives to the church.
[3787.02 --> 3790.02]  Apostles lay the foundation of the gospel.
[3790.02 --> 3793.02]  Prophets who speak the word of God.
[3793.02 --> 3798.02]  Evangelists who bring the good news of grace to a broken world and people who don't yet know.
[3798.02 --> 3802.02]  Pastors who care for the church as shepherds.
[3802.02 --> 3807.02]  Teachers who renew God's people with the mind of Christ.
[3807.02 --> 3812.02]  Right, this is the kinds of people and the kinds of gifts that Christ has given to his church.
[3812.02 --> 3814.02]  But here is the key.
[3814.02 --> 3816.02]  This is what I want to focus on is in verse 12.
[3816.02 --> 3819.02]  What do these gifts, these people do?
[3819.02 --> 3825.02]  They are to equip his people for works of service.
[3825.02 --> 3830.02]  So these gifts are given to help equip the whole church to do the works of service,
[3830.02 --> 3834.02]  or as some translations say, the works of ministry.
[3834.02 --> 3837.02]  Now I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
[3837.02 --> 3842.02]  This is most pastors favorite verse in the Bible.
[3842.02 --> 3844.02]  Can you guess why?
[3844.02 --> 3850.02]  Because what this verse tells me is that the work of ministry is not my job.
[3850.02 --> 3852.02]  It's your job.
[3852.02 --> 3854.02]  Yes.
[3854.02 --> 3857.02]  So I can go on vacation next week, right?
[3857.02 --> 3860.02]  No, I will come to work.
[3860.02 --> 3863.02]  But there's a pastor trying to make this point to his congregation.
[3863.02 --> 3865.02]  And this is what he did.
[3865.02 --> 3868.02]  He said to his congregation, I want you to get out a piece of paper.
[3868.02 --> 3875.02]  And I want you to write down on this piece of paper all of the things that you think your pastor should do.
[3875.02 --> 3880.02]  What are all the works of ministry that I, as the pastor, should do?
[3880.02 --> 3881.02]  Right?
[3881.02 --> 3882.02]  Visit me when I'm sick.
[3882.02 --> 3883.02]  Pray for me.
[3883.02 --> 3884.02]  Teach me the Bible.
[3884.02 --> 3885.02]  Counsel me.
[3885.02 --> 3886.02]  Lead ministry programs.
[3886.02 --> 3887.02]  Do evangelism.
[3887.02 --> 3888.02]  Right?
[3888.02 --> 3889.02]  Just this long list.
[3889.02 --> 3891.02]  All the things that a pastor is expected to do.
[3891.02 --> 3894.02]  Then he says, okay, you got it all down.
[3894.02 --> 3895.02]  Good.
[3895.02 --> 3900.02]  I just want to let you know that this is your job description.
[3900.02 --> 3906.02]  If you are a Christian, you have a ministry.
[3906.02 --> 3909.02]  You have works of service.
[3909.02 --> 3922.02]  And the apostles and the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers are there to help equip and to empower and to guide and shape and release you to do the work that God has called you to do.
[3922.02 --> 3928.02]  And so please just let me say this now because if not, as I learned from the banisters yesterday, if not now, when?
[3928.02 --> 3929.02]  Okay.
[3929.02 --> 3930.02]  Okay.
[3930.02 --> 3935.02]  Here, this is the opportunity for me to say this.
[3935.02 --> 3938.02]  There is no difference between me and you.
[3938.02 --> 3939.02]  Okay.
[3939.02 --> 3942.02]  I really want you to understand this.
[3942.02 --> 3945.02]  I am standing up here facing you.
[3945.02 --> 3948.02]  You're all looking this way, but that's it.
[3948.02 --> 3949.02]  I am one of you.
[3949.02 --> 3951.02]  I am a member of this church.
[3951.02 --> 3956.02]  I don't do things for you for God.
[3956.02 --> 3959.02]  We are all redeemed by the blood of Christ.
[3959.02 --> 3965.02]  We have all been given different gifts and we are upholding for the same thing, which is to make Christ known in this world.
[3965.02 --> 3970.02]  My job, my gift maybe, is to preach the word.
[3970.02 --> 3974.02]  And then God will do in you and through you what he is going to do.
[3974.02 --> 3984.02]  And so you need to know your gifts, what they are, and then to live and move in those gifts.
[3984.02 --> 3989.02]  He made some of us to be more sympathetic.
[3989.02 --> 3992.02]  He's made some of us to be more patient.
[3992.02 --> 3994.02]  Probably most of you are more patient than me.
[3994.02 --> 3996.02]  Some of us are more bold and adventurous.
[3996.02 --> 3999.02]  Some of us are more generous than others.
[3999.02 --> 4001.02]  Some with more wisdom.
[4001.02 --> 4003.02]  Some with better administration.
[4003.02 --> 4004.02]  Some are scholars.
[4004.02 --> 4005.02]  Right?
[4005.02 --> 4011.02]  And you might have the ability to bring a person who is troubled to a point of being comforted and praying for them.
[4011.02 --> 4012.02]  Right?
[4012.02 --> 4013.02]  That's a gift.
[4013.02 --> 4015.02]  So we need helps.
[4015.02 --> 4016.02]  We need service.
[4016.02 --> 4018.02]  We need wisdom.
[4018.02 --> 4019.02]  We need strength.
[4019.02 --> 4020.02]  We need boldness.
[4020.02 --> 4021.02]  We need discernment.
[4021.02 --> 4022.02]  We need prayer.
[4022.02 --> 4024.02]  We need Sunday school teachers.
[4024.02 --> 4026.02]  We need hospitality.
[4026.02 --> 4028.02]  We need small group leaders.
[4028.02 --> 4030.02]  We need those who set up on communion.
[4030.02 --> 4031.02]  We need those who sing.
[4031.02 --> 4037.02]  We need all of these things because without all of us using our gifts, the body of Christ suffers.
[4037.02 --> 4040.02]  That's what Paul says here.
[4040.02 --> 4046.02]  And not everyone has all of these gifts, but all of us together do have all of these gifts.
[4046.02 --> 4047.02]  Right?
[4047.02 --> 4048.02]  That's the marvel of it.
[4048.02 --> 4052.02]  And that means that all of us are vital for the building up of the church.
[4052.02 --> 4055.02]  Okay, so friends, Jesus Christ has won you.
[4055.02 --> 4056.02]  He has captured you.
[4056.02 --> 4062.02]  And he has given you to the church to do the work of ministry.
[4062.02 --> 4063.02]  Right?
[4063.02 --> 4065.02]  That's what Jesus, that's what Paul is talking about here.
[4065.02 --> 4069.02]  And now thirdly, what does this ministry do?
[4069.02 --> 4070.02]  Right?
[4070.02 --> 4071.02]  What is all this headed towards?
[4071.02 --> 4072.02]  We're doing all this ministry.
[4072.02 --> 4073.02]  Why?
[4073.02 --> 4074.02]  What's the goal?
[4074.02 --> 4079.02]  Paul tells us here in verses 12 and 13.
[4079.02 --> 4091.02]  So that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith, knowledge of the Son of God, become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of God.
[4091.02 --> 4093.02]  There's a lot of stuff going on there.
[4093.02 --> 4096.02]  But this is all to say, what is the goal of ministry?
[4096.02 --> 4107.02]  Paul says it is to reach unity in maturity of the faith, to know Jesus, to grow up, to become every way like Jesus.
[4107.02 --> 4108.02]  Not do you know your Bible?
[4108.02 --> 4110.02]  Do you know Jesus?
[4110.02 --> 4113.02]  Are you becoming more and more like him?
[4113.02 --> 4121.02]  Are you growing closer to him through prayer, through reading the word, through fellowship and through worship and through service?
[4121.02 --> 4124.02]  This is how we grow up into Christ.
[4124.02 --> 4129.02]  We take on the character of Christ.
[4129.02 --> 4141.02]  So every gift that you and I have is bound together toward this one goal, the goal of building up all of us, the body of Christ, to reach the fullness of maturity in Christ.
[4141.02 --> 4144.02]  And then Paul goes on and he contrasts that.
[4144.02 --> 4149.02]  And so what's the alternative to this maturity and growth in Christ?
[4149.02 --> 4151.02]  Well, he tells us in verse 14.
[4151.02 --> 4164.02]  It says, then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by waves, blown here and there by every wind of teaching, by the cunning and craftiness of people and their deceitful scheming.
[4164.02 --> 4165.02]  Right?
[4165.02 --> 4170.02]  The alternative actually looks like, sadly, what a lot of the church looks like.
[4170.02 --> 4171.02]  A child.
[4171.02 --> 4172.02]  What's a child?
[4172.02 --> 4173.02]  A child is just immature.
[4173.02 --> 4176.02]  They don't look yet like their parents.
[4176.02 --> 4182.02]  They need to grow into maturity to do what their parents do, to learn how to be in this world.
[4182.02 --> 4185.02]  Children are immature.
[4185.02 --> 4188.02]  And so Paul says we can be like that as the body of Christ.
[4188.02 --> 4193.02]  We can be immature, not looking like our Heavenly Father, not doing the things he calls us to do yet.
[4193.02 --> 4196.02]  And so therefore, you know, children are naive.
[4196.02 --> 4197.02]  You can tell them all kinds of things.
[4197.02 --> 4198.02]  They'll believe you.
[4198.02 --> 4200.02]  Does the world tell us all kinds of things?
[4200.02 --> 4201.02]  We're like, okay.
[4201.02 --> 4203.02]  No, we need to, we don't want that.
[4203.02 --> 4204.02]  We don't want to be immature.
[4204.02 --> 4205.02]  We want to be mature.
[4205.02 --> 4208.02]  We want to be mature.
[4208.02 --> 4211.02]  Now, how do we grow up to maturity in Christ?
[4211.02 --> 4214.02]  How do we, how do we grow up and become mature?
[4214.02 --> 4216.02]  Well, this is what I want to focus on the last thing.
[4216.02 --> 4218.02]  Look with me at verse 15.
[4218.02 --> 4223.02]  He says, instead, right, instead of this immaturity, grow up in Christ.
[4223.02 --> 4224.02]  How do you do that?
[4224.02 --> 4227.02]  Speaking the truth in love.
[4227.02 --> 4231.02]  We will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head.
[4231.02 --> 4233.02]  That is, Christ.
[4233.02 --> 4236.02]  Okay, so how does the church build itself up?
[4236.02 --> 4238.02]  How does it become more mature?
[4238.02 --> 4240.02]  By speaking the truth in love.
[4240.02 --> 4242.02]  Now, what does that phrase mean?
[4242.02 --> 4244.02]  If you think about that, speak the truth in love.
[4244.02 --> 4245.02]  What comes to your mind?
[4245.02 --> 4250.02]  I think, you know, for a lot of us, we might think, well, speak the truth in love.
[4250.02 --> 4256.02]  It's kind of like, you know, you have to say something a little difficult to somebody, but just say it nicely.
[4256.02 --> 4257.02]  Right?
[4257.02 --> 4258.02]  Right?
[4258.02 --> 4259.02]  Say it in love.
[4259.02 --> 4261.02]  Have you heard of a love sandwich?
[4261.02 --> 4266.02]  You know, that's when your communication, you say, you know, here's the bread.
[4266.02 --> 4268.02]  You're really wonderful.
[4268.02 --> 4269.02]  I love you.
[4269.02 --> 4270.02]  You're so great.
[4270.02 --> 4273.02]  You're this little thing, you know, I'm concerned about.
[4273.02 --> 4276.02]  But you're really, you know, you're an amazing person, right?
[4276.02 --> 4277.02]  That's a love sandwich.
[4277.02 --> 4278.02]  Okay.
[4278.02 --> 4280.02]  That's not what Paul is talking about here.
[4280.02 --> 4284.02]  You know, he's not like, you know, just you got to tell your neighbor that they have bad breath.
[4284.02 --> 4285.02]  Suck it up.
[4285.02 --> 4286.02]  But just do it nicely.
[4286.02 --> 4288.02]  You know, that's not what he is saying.
[4288.02 --> 4290.02]  That's not speaking the truth in love.
[4290.02 --> 4293.02]  He's talking about the gospel.
[4293.02 --> 4296.02]  Speaking gospel truth.
[4296.02 --> 4297.02]  How do we know that's what he means?
[4297.02 --> 4300.02]  Well, because of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13.
[4300.02 --> 4302.02]  We just go back in our Bibles.
[4302.02 --> 4304.02]  This is what it says.
[4304.02 --> 4308.02]  And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth.
[4308.02 --> 4311.02]  The gospel of your salvation.
[4311.02 --> 4313.02]  So Paul says, this is what I want you to do.
[4313.02 --> 4319.02]  I want you, brothers and sisters, to build up one another by speaking the truth in love.
[4319.02 --> 4322.02]  By speaking the gospel to one another.
[4322.02 --> 4323.02]  All day.
[4323.02 --> 4324.02]  Every day.
[4324.02 --> 4327.02]  Speaking the gospel to each other.
[4327.02 --> 4332.02]  And this means that every one of you here who is a Christian, if you have repented of your sin.
[4332.02 --> 4335.02]  If you have put your faith in Jesus.
[4335.02 --> 4338.02]  You are equipped to build up the body.
[4338.02 --> 4340.02]  Every single one of you.
[4340.02 --> 4342.02]  Whether you're a brand new believer.
[4342.02 --> 4345.02]  Whether you've been a believer for 70, 80 years.
[4346.02 --> 4349.02]  Because you know the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[4349.02 --> 4351.02]  You don't have to go to seminary.
[4351.02 --> 4353.02]  You don't have to get theological training.
[4353.02 --> 4356.02]  You just need to know that Jesus loves you.
[4356.02 --> 4358.02]  And you need to understand that Christ died for sinners.
[4358.02 --> 4360.02]  Including you and me.
[4360.02 --> 4363.02]  That by his grace that he has lavished upon you.
[4363.02 --> 4365.02]  He has saved you.
[4365.02 --> 4367.02]  And we respond by faith alone.
[4367.02 --> 4370.02]  And friends, you can speak that word to one another.
[4370.02 --> 4373.02]  Now, why just the gospel?
[4373.02 --> 4374.02]  Is that strong enough?
[4374.02 --> 4375.02]  Is it big enough?
[4375.02 --> 4377.02]  Is it too elementary?
[4377.02 --> 4378.02]  Well no.
[4378.02 --> 4382.02]  Friends, what else has the power to free people from their sins?
[4382.02 --> 4388.02]  What else has the power to liberate us from our fears and anxieties.
[4388.02 --> 4390.02]  And caring what other people say about us.
[4390.02 --> 4392.02]  Or caring what the world thinks.
[4392.02 --> 4396.02]  What else has the power to help us through any trial and trouble?
[4396.02 --> 4398.02]  Nothing.
[4398.02 --> 4402.02]  The gospel has the power to do all of that.
[4402.02 --> 4406.02]  The message of the gospel is that Jesus Christ, even when we were his enemies,
[4406.02 --> 4408.02]  he loved you and he gave himself for you.
[4408.02 --> 4412.02]  And that now through his victory, he has clothed you with righteousness.
[4412.02 --> 4419.02]  And now you have direct access to God the Father, who loves you as his child.
[4419.02 --> 4426.02]  And friends, if you believe that and if you trust that thoroughly in every area of your life,
[4426.02 --> 4428.02]  you will, your life will be transformed.
[4428.02 --> 4434.02]  And so what you do, I'm fearing, I'm not trusting, I'm struggling in this area of my life.
[4434.02 --> 4437.02]  We need the gospel in that area of our lives.
[4437.02 --> 4441.02]  So we believe in God and trust in him and know Jesus loves us and died for us.
[4441.02 --> 4444.02]  That's how we grow in maturity in Christ.
[4444.02 --> 4447.02]  So friends, you can speak the truth with one another.
[4447.02 --> 4451.02]  You can comfort one another with the balm of the gospel.
[4451.02 --> 4457.02]  Because believing the gospel more and more deeply is what causes us to grow in Christian maturity.
[4457.02 --> 4459.02]  And Paul says it has to be done in love.
[4459.02 --> 4461.02]  It has to be done in love.
[4461.02 --> 4466.02]  Because if you take love out of anything, what happens to that thing?
[4466.02 --> 4468.02]  It dries up.
[4468.02 --> 4472.02]  Love is a very important part of everything we do.
[4472.02 --> 4473.02]  Right?
[4473.02 --> 4474.02]  What does Paul say?
[4474.02 --> 4481.02]  If I can move mountains, but have not love, what does it profit me?
[4481.02 --> 4482.02]  Right?
[4482.02 --> 4486.02]  If you take love out of sanctification, what do you get?
[4486.02 --> 4488.02]  Self-righteousness.
[4488.02 --> 4495.02]  If you take love out of joy, well, you get hedonism.
[4495.02 --> 4499.02]  You get the empty pursuit of pleasure.
[4499.02 --> 4504.02]  If you take love out of truth, what do you get?
[4504.02 --> 4505.02]  Orthodoxy.
[4505.02 --> 4507.02]  Dead orthodoxy.
[4507.02 --> 4511.02]  Truth and love go together because God is truth and God is love.
[4511.02 --> 4513.02]  And you can't separate those things.
[4513.02 --> 4518.02]  The truth of the gospel has to be proclaimed and lived out in a way that is loving.
[4518.02 --> 4521.02]  So what is the definition of love?
[4521.02 --> 4525.02]  If you love another person, you what?
[4525.02 --> 4532.02]  If you love another person, you enhance their relationship with Jesus.
[4532.02 --> 4534.02]  That's what love is.
[4534.02 --> 4536.02]  A parent has to discipline a child.
[4536.02 --> 4539.02]  The child says, you hate me.
[4539.02 --> 4541.02]  The parent says, no, I love you.
[4541.02 --> 4545.02]  And I want you to love Jesus and I want you to be obedient to him.
[4545.02 --> 4548.02]  So this discipline is to enhance your relationship with Jesus.
[4548.02 --> 4549.02]  I love you.
[4549.02 --> 4551.02]  That's why you're grounded.
[4551.02 --> 4554.02]  How do spouses love one another?
[4554.02 --> 4558.02]  By enhancing their relationship with Jesus.
[4558.02 --> 4561.02]  And friends, how do we build up the body of Christ?
[4561.02 --> 4567.02]  By enhancing our relationship with Jesus.
[4567.02 --> 4568.02]  Right?
[4568.02 --> 4569.02]  Speaking the truth in love.
[4569.02 --> 4570.02]  Speaking gospel truth.
[4570.02 --> 4574.02]  Building up one another in faith as each part does its ministry.
[4574.02 --> 4580.02]  So God is inviting us as his people to be the body of Christ that build itself up in love.
[4580.02 --> 4583.02]  And friends, here's the good news.
[4583.02 --> 4586.02]  That the pressure is not on us.
[4586.02 --> 4587.02]  It's on Jesus.
[4587.02 --> 4589.02]  Jesus won us.
[4589.02 --> 4590.02]  He loves us.
[4590.02 --> 4591.02]  He's gifted us.
[4591.02 --> 4595.02]  And now he puts us in this body and he's going to help us to do this.
[4595.02 --> 4598.02]  He's going to build us up as he promises.
[4598.02 --> 4603.02]  So let's pray.
[4603.02 --> 4614.02]  Father, we thank you that Jesus is more committed to our spiritual growth, the maturity of the church, even than we are.
[4614.02 --> 4616.02]  We praise you for that.
[4616.02 --> 4618.02]  What a great grace that is.
[4618.02 --> 4627.02]  We pray that you would help us as your people to have a vision of us becoming like Christ that would be so compelling to us.
[4627.02 --> 4635.02]  And then may we help one another as the church become who you are making us to be.
[4635.02 --> 4639.02]  Father, would you do this and accomplish it among us as you promise.
[4639.02 --> 4641.02]  We ask this in Jesus name.
[4641.02 --> 4642.02]  Amen.
[4642.02 --> 4646.02]  Let's stand and let's sing our song of response.
[4646.02 --> 4647.02]  Okay.
[4647.02 --> 4652.02]  Thank you.
[4652.02 --> 4655.02]  Let's do it.
[4655.02 --> 4657.02]  Let's sing.
[4657.02 --> 4662.02]  Let's sing.
[4662.02 --> 4668.02]  Take my life and love in me.
[4668.02 --> 4673.02]  Concentrate and Lord to thee.
[4673.02 --> 4683.44]  Take my old lips and my days, let them flow in endless praise.
[4683.86 --> 4688.90]  Let them flow in endless praise.
[4690.54 --> 4700.08]  Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love.
[4700.08 --> 4710.28]  Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for thee.
[4710.84 --> 4715.82]  Swift and beautiful for thee.
[4717.52 --> 4726.84]  Take my voice and let me sing, always only for my King.
[4726.84 --> 4736.72]  Take my lips and let them be held with messages from thee.
[4736.72 --> 4742.50]  They'll be held with messages from thee.
[4743.18 --> 4748.10]  Take my sin, God, and my Lord.
[4748.10 --> 4753.10]  Take my heart and let them flow.
[4754.56 --> 4757.98]  Take my heart and let them flow.
[4757.98 --> 4762.86]  Take my heart and let them flow.
[4762.86 --> 4771.32]  Take my heart and let them flow.
[4771.32 --> 4775.86]  Take my will and make it thine.
[4776.28 --> 4780.86]  It shall be no longer mine.
[4781.38 --> 4785.86]  Take my heart, it is thine home.
[4785.86 --> 4790.74]  It shall be thy royal throne.
[4790.74 --> 4796.32]  It shall be thy royal throne.
[4797.32 --> 4803.04]  Take my love, my Lord, I pour.
[4803.62 --> 4808.58]  At thy feet its treasure store.
[4808.58 --> 4819.74]  Take myself and I will be ever only all for thee.
[4819.74 --> 4825.66]  Ever only all for thee.
[4825.66 --> 4838.50]  We continue our worship service with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4838.50 --> 4844.64]  Our designated offering for this Sunday is for, through Resonate Global Mission, for the Umarans.
[4845.98 --> 4851.96]  Najee and Ann, they came and spoke to us this summer and shared about their ministry in Egypt amongst Arab speakers.
[4851.96 --> 4856.50]  And we love them and we love to continue to support their ministry.
[4856.50 --> 4858.40]  So that's our designated offering.
[4858.40 --> 4861.84]  May I invite the deacons to come up and help collect the offering?
[4881.96 --> 4882.96]  Believe it, when I wish for you.
[4882.96 --> 4884.34]  I will.
[4884.40 --> 4885.64]  Amen.
[4886.18 --> 4887.78]  Take my heart.
[4889.14 --> 4889.18]  discut Hang up and wait.
[4890.10 --> 4893.04]  Wait a minute.
[4895.94 --> 4896.84]  election.

[5000.58 --> 5030.56]  Thank you.
[5030.56 --> 5060.54]  Thank you.
[5060.56 --> 5064.18]  And Lord, help them to be able to learn about this world that you have made.
[5065.40 --> 5067.80]  Lord, be with the high school students.
[5068.74 --> 5070.36]  Prepare their hearts for study.
[5071.02 --> 5072.92]  Provide them with good and godly friends.
[5072.92 --> 5081.10]  Lord, be with teachers that they may be equipped to teach effectively with love and patience.
[5081.10 --> 5088.56]  We pray for peace and patience for everyone and freedom from anxiety that new beginnings can often bring.
[5089.72 --> 5093.10]  Lord, we pray also for our ministries starting up again.
[5093.10 --> 5099.74]  May we grow together and bless each other and learn more about you from your word this year.
[5099.74 --> 5104.14]  We pray especially, Lord, for the start of small groups.
[5104.14 --> 5113.88]  And as we seek to gather and meet together in groups again after many years, may we be encouraged to connect with each other and connect in community.
[5113.88 --> 5114.88]  Lord, we pray for your help to help.
[5114.88 --> 5129.14]  Lord, we pray for your help to reach those around us with the gospel of your salvation.
[5129.14 --> 5133.14]  Lord, we pray for your help to guide us at the right moment.
[5133.14 --> 5139.14]  Whether boldness or compassion or patience or guidance is needed in each circumstance.
[5139.14 --> 5144.14]  Lord, we pray specifically for some of the needs of our congregation.
[5144.14 --> 5151.14]  Lord, we especially pray for Martin and Anne's brother-in-law who had a stroke and is in hospice.
[5151.14 --> 5158.14]  Be with their family as they gather and, Lord, celebrate his life.
[5158.14 --> 5165.14]  And, Lord, would you, Lord, if it's your will, revive him and keep him healthy for longer.
[5165.14 --> 5176.14]  Lord, we pray for Quinn, Terry and Lori's son-in-law who had a flying accident, Lord, and is in critical shape in the hospital.
[5176.14 --> 5179.14]  But, Lord, he is alive and his brain is okay.
[5179.14 --> 5182.14]  And, Lord, we just pray that you would give healing to his body.
[5182.14 --> 5184.14]  Lord, it will be a long road in front of him.
[5184.14 --> 5187.14]  But, Lord, would you heal everything that is broken.
[5187.14 --> 5194.14]  And, Lord, be with his new wife and with Terry and Lori and all their family, Lord, as they support each other.
[5194.14 --> 5198.14]  Lord, we pray for Robin here in our midst.
[5198.14 --> 5207.14]  Lord, as her mom has passed away a few years ago, but, Lord, she still grieves the passing of her mom and still misses her very much.
[5207.14 --> 5219.14]  Lord, would you comfort Robin's heart and, Lord, the hearts of all of us still who continue to feel the pain of loss.
[5219.14 --> 5225.14]  Lord, would you bind up our broken hearts and give us the hope of the gospel.
[5225.14 --> 5231.14]  And, Lord, we pray for all those needs that we have overlooked or aren't aware of.
[5231.14 --> 5233.14]  You know the needs of your people.
[5233.14 --> 5237.14]  You know the needs of this city, this province, and of your world.
[5237.14 --> 5239.14]  Lord, comfort and heal.
[5239.14 --> 5241.14]  Provide as needed.
[5241.14 --> 5246.14]  And, above all, Lord, bring people into your kingdom to acknowledge you as king.
[5246.14 --> 5250.14]  We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[5250.14 --> 5253.14]  Please stand.
[5253.14 --> 5259.14]  We go forth from here with God's last word.
[5259.14 --> 5263.14]  He calls us to worship, and he sends us out to worship.
[5263.14 --> 5266.14]  We worship him as we live for him as we go out from here.
[5266.14 --> 5273.14]  So, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving this blessing and being prepared to go out with it.
[5273.14 --> 5277.14]  Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm.
[5277.14 --> 5279.14]  Let nothing move you.
[5279.14 --> 5286.14]  Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
[5286.14 --> 5293.14]  Amen.
