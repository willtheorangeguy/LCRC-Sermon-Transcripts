[29.22 → 30.22] Amen.
[59.22 → 61.22] Amen.
[89.22 → 91.22] Amen.
[119.22 → 121.22] Amen.
[149.22 → 151.22] Amen.
[179.22 → 181.22] Amen.
[209.22 → 211.22] Amen.

[389.22 → 391.22] Amen.
[419.22 → 421.22] Amen.
[437.22 → 441.22] Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[441.22 → 448.22] May each one of us find great joy and spiritual nourishment as we worship together today.
[448.22 → 452.22] My name is Jason Bullet along with Marianne Mandrel on the piano.
[452.22 → 456.22] We will be leading you and all of us in worship this morning.
[456.22 → 460.22] So before we begin, just a couple of announcements.
[460.22 → 467.22] One is our congregational meeting is coming up and there are two dates in your bulletin.
[467.22 → 468.22] So we'll get that fixed.
[468.22 → 474.22] But on the inside it says March 7, sorry, don't get, okay, I'm making it worse.
[474.22 → 479.22] March 9, it's a Monday, March 9 at 7 p.m.
[479.22 → 480.22] That's the correct date.
[480.22 → 482.22] The one on the back is not correct.
[482.22 → 486.22] So it starts at 7, not 7.30, at 7.00.
[486.22 → 489.22] And on March 9th.
[489.22 → 491.22] That's a Wednesday.
[491.22 → 498.22] And so also the agenda and the materials have been prepared and Dorothy has put them, many
[498.22 → 500.22] of them in your mail slot.
[500.22 → 503.22] So after the service, please check your mail slots.
[503.22 → 505.22] And this way we're trying to save on some postage.
[505.22 → 510.22] And if you don't pick them up from your mail slots, they will then just be mailed to you.
[510.22 → 513.22] So we'll make sure you get them.
[513.22 → 519.22] In addition, we have a regular Wednesday morning Bible study for men and women.
[519.22 → 523.22] And that is on Wednesdays at 9.30 in the morning.
[523.22 → 524.22] And everyone is welcome.
[524.22 → 527.22] We are studying the Gospel of John together.
[527.22 → 531.22] And, so please do come and check that out.
[531.22 → 543.22] And so right now, we are going to invite the Area family to come up.
[543.22 → 544.22] No?
[544.22 → 545.22] Maybe sometime in the service.
[545.22 → 546.22] We'll do it later.
[546.22 → 547.22] Yeah.
[547.22 → 548.22] Okay.
[548.22 → 550.22] So our call to worship this morning.
[550.22 → 556.22] Would everyone please rise in spirit and body, however you are able, and join me in the call
[556.22 → 558.22] to worship this morning.
[558.22 → 571.22] Jesus Christ has ascended into heaven and is at God's right hand with angels, authorities, and powers in submission to him.
[571.22 → 585.22] Since we have a great high priest who has gone into heaven, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
[585.22 → 588.22] Let us praise his holy name.
[588.22 → 595.22] Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[595.22 → 597.22] For us in glory, we do.
[597.22 → 598.22] Wisdom and thanks.
[598.22 → 604.22] Honour, power, and strength be to our God forevermore.
[604.22 → 606.22] Let's pray together.
[606.22 → 611.22] Lord, we join our voices to give you honour and praise this morning.
[611.22 → 615.22] You are in heaven, high and lifted.
[615.22 → 617.22] Holy is your name.
[617.22 → 619.22] Besides you, there is no other.
[619.22 → 621.22] You are God.
[621.22 → 622.22] You alone.
[622.22 → 633.22] Father, thank you for gathering us all here as your body and for receiving us into your kingdom, the kingdom of your Son, Jesus, whose name we bear.
[633.22 → 636.22] Would you meet us in this time of worship?
[636.22 → 641.22] Father, we thank you that you welcome us and come to us as we are.
[641.22 → 643.22] But you don't leave us as we are.
[643.22 → 650.22] For in your presence and by your spirit, we are ever being conformed into the image of your Son.
[650.22 → 657.22] So, Father, we pray that you would speak to us, that you would teach us, comfort us, and challenge us this morning.
[657.22 → 664.22] We worship you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
[664.22 → 669.22] Our God now greets us with these words from Isaiah, chapter 40.
[669.22 → 676.22] See, the sovereign Lord comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm.
[676.22 → 678.22] He tends his flock like a shepherd.
[678.22 → 684.22] He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart.
[684.22 → 689.22] So, as the Lord has greeted us, let's now turn and greet one another.
[689.22 → 716.22] Thank you.
[716.22 → 721.22] As we praise God together this morning, we are having some technical difficulties.
[721.22 → 723.22] So, we'll do our best as a worship team.
[723.22 → 729.22] If you're not able to sing along, that you can still listen and be blessed.
[729.22 → 730.22] Thank you.
[730.22 → 731.22] Amen.
[731.22 → 732.22] Amen.
[732.22 → 733.22] Amen.
[733.22 → 734.22] Amen.
[734.22 → 735.22] Amen.
[735.22 → 737.22] Amen.
[737.22 → 738.22] Amen.
[738.22 → 739.22] Amen.
[739.22 → 740.22] Amen.
[740.22 → 741.22] Amen.
[741.22 → 742.22] Amen.
[742.22 → 743.22] Amen.
[743.22 → 744.22] Amen.
[744.22 → 750.22] As death dependent for the water, so my soul longs after you.
[750.22 → 761.14] You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you
[761.14 → 767.02] You alone are my strength, my shield
[767.02 → 772.42] To you alone may my spirit yield
[772.42 → 783.40] You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you
[783.40 → 793.28] You're my friend, and you are my brother even though you are a king
[793.28 → 803.16] I love you more than any other, so much more than anything
[803.16 → 810.26] You alone are my strength, my shield
[810.26 → 815.86] To you alone may my spirit yield
[815.86 → 825.86] You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you
[825.86 → 836.00] I want you more than gold or silver, only you can satisfy
[836.00 → 845.84] You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of the earth
[845.84 → 868.84] You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you
[868.84 → 870.84] Wonderful, so wonderful is your unbearable
[870.84 → 871.84] Dear God
[871.84 → 873.84] You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you
[873.84 → 875.84] I want you to worship you
[875.84 → 877.84] I want you to worship you
[877.84 → 883.84] Wonderful, so wonderful is your unbearable
[883.84 → 900.68] Wonderful, so wonderful is your unfailing love
[900.68 → 907.10] Your cross has spoken mercy over me
[907.10 → 916.66] No eyes have seen, no ears have heard, no heart can fully know
[916.66 → 924.24] How glorious, how beautiful you are
[924.24 → 932.58] Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore
[932.58 → 939.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[939.58 → 948.58] Powerful, so powerful, your glory fills the skies
[949.28 → 955.58] Your mighty works displays for all to see
[955.58 → 964.58] The beauty of your majesty awakes my heart to see
[964.58 → 971.58] How marvellous, how wonderful you are
[971.58 → 980.58] Beautiful one I love, beautiful one I adore
[980.58 → 987.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[987.58 → 992.58] You opened my eyes to your wonders anew
[992.58 → 996.58] You captured my heart with this love
[996.58 → 1002.58] There's nothing on earth that's beautiful as you
[1002.58 → 1003.58] Beautiful one I adore
[1003.58 → 1004.58] Beautiful one I adore
[1004.58 → 1005.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[1005.58 → 1009.58] You opened my eyes to your wonders anew
[1009.58 → 1013.58] You captured my heart with this love
[1013.58 → 1020.58] There's nothing on earth that's beautiful as you
[1020.58 → 1021.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[1021.58 → 1025.58] Beautiful one I adore
[1025.58 → 1029.58] Beautiful one I adore
[1029.58 → 1035.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[1035.58 → 1041.58] Beautiful one I love
[1041.58 → 1042.58] Beautiful One I adore
[1042.58 → 1052.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[1052.58 → 1056.58] Beautiful one I adore
[1056.58 → 1058.58] Beautiful one My soul must say
[1058.58 → 1060.40] Beautiful one I adore
[1060.40 → 1063.58] Beautiful one my soul must say
[1063.58 → 1066.24] Beautiful one I adore
[1066.24 → 1070.22] 1
[1096.24 → 1109.60] Eternal God, unchanging, mysterious and unknown
[1109.60 → 1119.60] Your boundless love, unfailing, grace and mercy show
[1119.60 → 1125.42] Bright seraphim ates, easeless flight
[1125.42 → 1130.06] Around your glorious throne
[1130.06 → 1135.18] They raise their voices day and night
[1135.18 → 1139.18] In praise to you, our Lord
[1139.18 → 1149.10] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1149.10 → 1158.86] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1158.86 → 1166.50] Lord, we are weak and afraid
[1166.50 → 1170.62] Help us in the storm
[1170.62 → 1176.50] Surround us with your angels
[1176.50 → 1181.14] Hold us in our hearts
[1181.14 → 1185.78] A cold and ruthless enemy
[1185.78 → 1190.42] His pleasure, his heart
[1190.42 → 1195.54] Rise up, O Lord, and he will flee
[1195.54 → 1199.54] Before our seven calling
[1199.54 → 1208.18] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1208.18 → 1218.18] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1218.18 → 1225.62] Let every creature in the sea
[1225.62 → 1229.76] Let every flying bird
[1229.76 → 1234.32] Let every mountain and earth
[1234.32 → 1238.96] Feel and belly of the earth
[1238.96 → 1244.12] Let all the moons and all the stars
[1244.12 → 1248.76] In all the universe
[1248.76 → 1250.76] Sing praise to his soul
[1250.76 → 1256.88] The link of the rose and by his name
[1256.88 → 1265.88] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1265.88 → 1275.40] Hallelujah, glory be to our great God
[1275.40 → 1294.84] So we'll continue to worship the Lord
[1294.84 → 1297.00] This morning in a time of confession
[1297.00 → 1302.04] And this confession comes from Psalm 51
[1302.04 → 1305.28] And we'll read it responsibly
[1305.28 → 1314.74] Have mercy on me, O God
[1314.74 → 1317.70] According to your unfailing love
[1317.70 → 1320.66] According to your great compassion
[1320.66 → 1322.68] Blot out my transgressions
[1322.68 → 1325.92] Wash away all my iniquity
[1325.92 → 1329.02] And cleanse me from my sin
[1329.02 → 1334.04] My transgression and my sin
[1334.04 → 1335.68] Is always before me
[1335.68 → 1340.02] Against you, you only have I sinned
[1340.02 → 1343.12] And done what is evil in your sight
[1343.12 → 1345.84] So you are right in your verdict
[1345.84 → 1348.60] And justified when you judge
[1348.60 → 1351.92] Surely I was sinful at birth
[1351.92 → 1355.42] Sinful from the time my mother conceived me
[1355.42 → 1357.90] Yet you desired faithfulness
[1357.90 → 1359.04] Even in the womb
[1359.04 → 1361.90] You taught me wisdom in that secret place
[1361.90 → 1365.14] Cleanse me with hyssop
[1365.14 → 1366.74] And I will be clean
[1366.74 → 1368.26] Wash me
[1368.26 → 1370.38] And I will be whiter than snow
[1370.38 → 1373.46] Let me hear joy and gladness
[1373.46 → 1376.70] Let the bones you have crushed rejoice
[1376.70 → 1380.08] Hide your face from my sins
[1380.08 → 1382.50] And blot out all my iniquity
[1382.50 → 1387.58] Create in me a pure heart, O God
[1387.58 → 1390.84] And renew a steadfast spirit within me
[1390.84 → 1393.78] Do not cast me from your presence
[1393.78 → 1396.70] Or take your Holy Spirit from me
[1396.70 → 1400.52] Restore to me the joy of your salvation
[1400.52 → 1404.92] And grant me a willing spirit to sustain me
[1404.92 → 1407.16] And hear us now, O Father
[1407.16 → 1409.04] As we come to you
[1409.04 → 1411.92] And bring our own need
[1411.92 → 1412.86] Our own sin
[1412.86 → 1413.90] To you
[1413.90 → 1414.96] Looking to Christ
[1414.96 → 1417.20] Who stood in our place
[1417.20 → 1419.68] And took our debt upon himself
[1419.68 → 1436.34] God assures us of his forgiveness
[1436.34 → 1438.32] With these words from Psalm 103
[1438.32 → 1442.10] The Lord is compassionate and gracious
[1442.10 → 1445.34] Slow to anger and abounding in love
[1445.34 → 1448.06] He will not always accuse
[1448.06 → 1450.92] Nor will he harbour his anger forever
[1450.92 → 1454.14] He does not treat us as our sins deserve
[1454.14 → 1456.64] Or repay us according to our iniquities
[1456.64 → 1460.00] For as high as the heavens are above the earth
[1460.00 → 1462.42] So great is his love for those who fear him
[1462.42 → 1465.50] As far as the east is from the west
[1465.50 → 1469.66] So far has he removed our transgressions from us
[1469.66 → 1473.12] And as a father has compassion on his children
[1473.12 → 1477.40] So the Lord has compassion on those who fear him
[1477.40 → 1479.18] Brothers and sisters
[1479.18 → 1480.90] As those who have been forgiven
[1480.90 → 1483.20] And made whole by the saving work of Jesus
[1483.20 → 1484.74] Let's stand together
[1484.74 → 1486.96] Let's sing of his grace
[1486.96 → 1487.96] Please rise
[1487.96 → 1506.62] Purify my heart
[1506.62 → 1509.62] Let me be as gold
[1509.62 → 1512.90] And precious silver
[1512.90 → 1516.52] Purify my heart
[1516.52 → 1519.62] Let me be as gold
[1519.62 → 1522.88] Pure gold
[1522.88 → 1526.62] Refine as fire
[1526.62 → 1530.62] My heart's one desire
[1530.62 → 1535.62] Is to be holy
[1535.62 → 1539.62] Set apart for you
[1539.62 → 1544.62] I choose to be holy
[1544.62 → 1549.62] Set apart for you
[1549.62 → 1551.06] My master
[1551.06 → 1554.62] Ready to kneel with
[1554.62 → 1558.62] Purify my heart
[1558.62 → 1561.62] Glance me from within
[1561.62 → 1563.62] And make me holy
[1563.62 → 1564.62] And make me holy
[1564.62 → 1568.62] Purify my heart
[1568.62 → 1569.62] Glance me from my sin
[1569.62 → 1570.62] Deep within
[1570.62 → 1571.62] And make me holy
[1571.62 → 1572.62] Purify my heart
[1572.62 → 1573.62] Glance me from my sin
[1573.62 → 1574.62] Deep within
[1574.62 → 1575.62] Refine as fire
[1575.62 → 1577.62] My heart's one desire
[1577.62 → 1579.62] Is to be holy
[1579.62 → 1590.62] Set apart for you
[1590.62 → 1592.62] Set apart for you
[1592.62 → 1597.62] I choose to be holy
[1597.62 → 1601.62] Set apart for you
[1601.62 → 1602.62] My master
[1602.62 → 1604.62] Ready to be holy
[1604.62 → 1606.62] Ready to be holy
[1606.62 → 1607.62] Ready to be holy
[1607.62 → 1608.62] Ready to be holy
[1622.62 → 1629.62] So the children now ages three to grade seven are welcome to go to their Sunday school class.
[1629.62 → 1640.62] And we here above grade seven will prepare to hear and study God's word together.
[1640.62 → 1646.62] So we will invite Kikuyu to come up and read the word of the Lord for us.
[1646.62 → 1647.62] Good morning.
[1647.62 → 1648.62] I'm going to read by Amharic language Matthew 6.13.
[1648.62 → 1667.62] Good morning.
[1667.62 → 1668.62] Good morning.
[1668.62 → 1669.62] Good morning.
[1669.62 → 1674.62] I'm going to read by Amharic language Matthew 6.13.
[1674.62 → 1679.62] Okay.
[1679.62 → 1682.62] Amen.
[1682.62 → 1695.62] God bless you.
[1695.62 → 1706.62] Amen.
[1706.62 → 1708.62] Amen.
[1708.62 → 1720.96] So that language, if you didn't catch it, was Amharic.
[1721.28 → 1724.06] That is the official language of Ethiopia.
[1725.58 → 1728.66] So also, as we have been studying the Lord's Prayer,
[1728.90 → 1732.86] we have been also following along and reading from the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1733.76 → 1735.72] And so let's read this also together this morning.
[1736.28 → 1738.02] Question and answer 126.
[1738.62 → 1741.04] What does the fifth petition mean?
[1742.64 → 1748.14] Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors, means,
[1749.02 → 1754.98] because of Christ's blood, do not hold against us, poor sinners that we are,
[1755.56 → 1761.34] any of the sins we do, or the evil that constantly clings to us.
[1762.56 → 1766.00] Forgive us, just as we are fully determined,
[1766.00 → 1771.32] as evidence of your grace in us, to forgive our neighbours.
[1773.02 → 1775.74] So we have been looking at the Lord's Prayer together,
[1776.34 → 1781.72] going line by line through this prayer that Jesus himself taught us,
[1782.06 → 1784.10] as his disciples, how to pray.
[1784.10 → 1789.10] And today we're going to be focusing on this fifth petition of the Lord's Prayer,
[1789.24 → 1792.94] forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors.
[1793.48 → 1797.72] But before we do, let's have a look at the Lord's Prayer here
[1797.72 → 1800.96] and remind ourselves of where we have come.
[1800.96 → 1804.92] So first, the Lord's Prayer begins,
[1805.92 → 1807.84] and we'll see if we can get them up, yep.
[1808.52 → 1813.02] It begins with this address, where we come before our Heavenly Father.
[1813.36 → 1815.38] We pray, Our Father in Heaven.
[1816.22 → 1818.70] Jesus invites us to pray to our Heavenly Father,
[1818.98 → 1822.50] the one who hears us and cares for us.
[1822.50 → 1825.76] So that's the context of this prayer.
[1826.88 → 1829.86] And then there are two halves of the prayer.
[1830.58 → 1836.42] In the first half, Jesus teaches us to pray about God and his kingdom.
[1837.44 → 1838.62] He teaches us to pray,
[1839.00 → 1841.98] Hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,
[1842.42 → 1844.92] your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[1845.18 → 1848.92] Three different ways, really, of asking the same thing.
[1848.92 → 1853.54] That God's sovereign, saving, restorative reign
[1853.54 → 1858.96] would advance in the world for God's sake and for the world's sake.
[1859.30 → 1860.72] That's the first three petitions.
[1861.80 → 1864.30] And then we come to the second half of the prayer.
[1865.10 → 1868.42] And we can see that it is a slightly different focus.
[1868.56 → 1872.20] It's focusing on ourselves and on the church
[1872.20 → 1875.64] and preparing ourselves to be God's instruments
[1875.64 → 1879.10] in his world for his kingdom's sake.
[1880.10 → 1884.90] And so the second half, the second three petitions we ask is,
[1885.52 → 1886.84] Give us today our daily bread.
[1887.36 → 1890.56] Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[1891.06 → 1894.74] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[1895.32 → 1896.62] The second three petitions.
[1897.14 → 1898.36] And now, so you might be wondering,
[1898.36 → 1902.14] if you've prayed the Lord's Prayer, as all of us surely have,
[1902.64 → 1904.04] where's that last part?
[1904.04 → 1908.38] Right? For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[1908.70 → 1909.52] That's on the next slide.
[1910.60 → 1911.76] How about that?
[1912.28 → 1916.12] Well, that final line isn't actually in either place
[1916.12 → 1917.86] where we find the Lord's Prayer in the scriptures.
[1918.02 → 1921.36] It's not in Luke 11, and it's not in Matthew 6.
[1922.06 → 1926.40] Rather, the final line is from a first or second century document
[1926.40 → 1927.74] called the Didache.
[1928.72 → 1930.28] And so it's not in the Bible.
[1930.28 → 1936.10] But it is very, very early in the Christian tradition.
[1936.30 → 1938.30] And so it is precious to us.
[1938.72 → 1941.50] And when we pray this ending to the prayer,
[1941.64 → 1944.22] we are kind of joining our brothers and sisters,
[1944.36 → 1947.96] the church, over the last 2,000 years when we pray that.
[1947.96 → 1949.96] And so it is good.
[1950.12 → 1954.76] It is appropriate for us to pray the Lord's Prayer ending with those words.
[1956.04 → 1959.70] And so we are immersing ourselves in the Lord's Prayer once again this morning.
[1959.94 → 1961.86] And now we move to our fifth petition,
[1962.40 → 1965.26] Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.
[1965.26 → 1969.04] So before we get into it, let me pray for us,
[1969.52 → 1971.76] and let's ask for our Father's help.
[1973.58 → 1976.62] Our Father in Heaven, as we open your word this morning,
[1976.82 → 1983.10] Lord, would you help us to understand the great extent to which we have been forgiven.
[1984.18 → 1990.60] And help us also, Lord, that we might extend forgiveness to others.
[1990.60 → 1992.66] Lord, we need your help.
[1992.78 → 1997.74] We need you to do your work that only you can do in our hearts.
[1998.82 → 2002.18] Father, transform us by your Spirit through your word this morning.
[2002.78 → 2004.26] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2004.80 → 2005.08] Amen.
[2007.46 → 2012.94] So have you ever heard of this project called Humans of New York?
[2013.58 → 2016.04] It was kind of popular six, eight years ago.
[2016.14 → 2017.32] I don't know where it's gone.
[2017.32 → 2021.28] But back a while ago, it was very popular on the internet.
[2022.38 → 2023.84] And there's this guy named Brandon.
[2024.06 → 2028.52] He would go around in the city of New York and take photos of people,
[2028.60 → 2031.28] not celebrities, not politicians, you know, whoever,
[2031.56 → 2033.40] just ordinary people on the street.
[2033.98 → 2036.98] From all walks of life, he would take their photo,
[2037.12 → 2039.32] and he would ask them questions about their lives,
[2039.90 → 2041.42] ask them to share a story.
[2042.16 → 2045.62] And one of the questions Brandon would ask people often is,
[2045.62 → 2049.70] do you remember the saddest moment of your life?
[2051.28 → 2056.12] And there's one story that I remember reading long ago that really stuck with me.
[2057.08 → 2064.30] One guy said, the saddest moment of my life is when I got locked up for dealing drugs.
[2065.50 → 2065.76] Right?
[2065.78 → 2066.60] That would be quite sad.
[2067.34 → 2070.56] But then he says, actually, I take that back.
[2070.56 → 2076.32] The saddest moment was when I took my five-year-old daughter to the doctor
[2076.32 → 2078.76] and found out she needed glasses.
[2080.04 → 2083.10] She put on those glasses, and she said,
[2083.72 → 2086.38] Daddy, Daddy, I can see, I can see.
[2087.98 → 2090.78] He says, tears just started streaming down my face.
[2090.78 → 2093.70] What an idiot I've been.
[2094.68 → 2097.74] We'd take drives to the Catskill Mountains in New York,
[2097.82 → 2099.20] and I'd point out a deer to her.
[2099.68 → 2101.64] And she'd never be able to see it.
[2102.16 → 2103.90] She'd always say, where, where?
[2104.84 → 2106.82] When it should have been obvious.
[2107.36 → 2110.98] I spent five years trying to give her everything I could,
[2111.32 → 2114.34] and I messed up the most important thing.
[2114.34 → 2123.50] You know, and we, all of us, all of us here have something that we are deeply ashamed of.
[2124.40 → 2124.66] Right?
[2124.70 → 2128.38] On the one hand, we are ashamed of the things that we have done,
[2128.58 → 2131.82] thoughts that we have indulged, words that we have said,
[2131.96 → 2133.46] relationships that we have broken,
[2134.20 → 2135.94] harms that we have caused other people.
[2137.16 → 2139.98] We're also ashamed of the things that we've left undone,
[2139.98 → 2144.20] the kindnesses that we could have showed but neglected,
[2145.20 → 2148.40] the decisions that we avoided making,
[2149.74 → 2151.36] friendships that we never pursued,
[2151.72 → 2152.96] marriages that have failed,
[2153.42 → 2154.88] children we didn't spend time with,
[2155.14 → 2157.32] all of this stuff that we didn't do.
[2157.62 → 2159.56] And all of these things, all that we have done,
[2159.68 → 2160.92] all that we have left undone,
[2160.92 → 2163.58] they weigh heavily on us.
[2165.26 → 2168.52] Every single person here, myself included,
[2168.52 → 2170.80] bears this bruise of shame,
[2171.54 → 2173.64] whether it's hidden in our hearts,
[2173.76 → 2174.96] whether it is exposed.
[2175.58 → 2177.04] And the question today is,
[2177.56 → 2179.96] what will you do with your shame?
[2180.92 → 2182.70] With this burden that we bear,
[2183.48 → 2186.88] what do you do with those saddest moments of your life?
[2188.02 → 2189.12] And Jesus says,
[2189.24 → 2192.00] what we need more than anything else
[2192.00 → 2193.44] is forgiveness.
[2193.44 → 2199.02] Pastor John Stott was once talking with the director
[2199.02 → 2201.48] of a large mental hospital in England,
[2201.48 → 2203.12] who told him this,
[2203.74 → 2204.46] the director said,
[2204.60 → 2206.96] I could dismiss half my patients tomorrow
[2206.96 → 2209.50] if they could be assured of forgiveness.
[2211.98 → 2214.10] Jesus taught his disciples to pray,
[2214.22 → 2215.06] and he said to them,
[2215.14 → 2216.26] when you pray, say,
[2216.62 → 2217.90] our Father in heaven,
[2218.34 → 2220.14] forgive us our debts,
[2220.76 → 2222.86] as we forgive our debtors.
[2223.80 → 2225.26] That's our petition this morning.
[2226.22 → 2228.92] And commentators agree that this is perhaps,
[2229.40 → 2230.04] on the one hand,
[2230.08 → 2232.28] the boldest prayer that we could pray,
[2232.92 → 2234.10] and at the same time,
[2234.22 → 2236.72] the most challenging and demanding.
[2238.20 → 2239.44] It's bold because,
[2239.60 → 2241.62] in light of all that we have done,
[2242.06 → 2243.68] all the sin in our lives,
[2243.72 → 2245.24] we are coming before God
[2245.24 → 2246.34] and saying,
[2246.42 → 2248.14] God, wipe it clean.
[2248.90 → 2250.64] Not because we deserve it,
[2250.72 → 2251.86] but just forgive us.
[2251.86 → 2252.46] It's bold.
[2254.90 → 2256.20] And at the same time,
[2256.28 → 2257.98] it's a demanding petition
[2257.98 → 2260.18] because we've been invited to do
[2260.18 → 2262.18] what God himself does,
[2262.26 → 2264.92] which is to forgive those who sin against us,
[2265.12 → 2267.54] to forgive our debtors.
[2268.64 → 2270.64] So these are the two parts of the prayer
[2270.64 → 2272.60] that we need to look at this morning.
[2272.60 → 2274.74] So first,
[2275.84 → 2277.18] Jesus teaches us to pray,
[2277.32 → 2278.66] forgive us our debts.
[2278.70 → 2279.18] And when we pray,
[2279.24 → 2280.02] forgive us our debts,
[2280.04 → 2280.62] what we're doing is,
[2280.72 → 2282.32] we're coming before our Heavenly Father,
[2282.88 → 2284.82] confessing the fact to Him
[2284.82 → 2288.28] that we desperately need His forgiveness.
[2289.10 → 2290.90] We need to receive forgiveness.
[2291.74 → 2293.10] We are affirming
[2293.10 → 2295.34] that we do sin.
[2295.34 → 2296.74] Right?
[2296.78 → 2298.26] That we do, in fact,
[2298.40 → 2300.60] contribute to the brokenness of the world.
[2301.38 → 2301.60] Right?
[2301.60 → 2302.48] That we do contribute
[2302.48 → 2303.84] to the tears
[2303.84 → 2304.56] and the heartache
[2304.56 → 2305.12] and the hurt.
[2306.44 → 2308.02] So this petition tells us
[2308.02 → 2309.52] that we need to receive forgiveness.
[2310.80 → 2312.54] But then it also tells us
[2312.54 → 2313.98] what this forgiveness is.
[2314.48 → 2315.26] Jesus tells us
[2315.26 → 2317.66] it's forgiveness of our debts.
[2317.66 → 2319.50] And I realize
[2319.50 → 2320.46] that language
[2320.46 → 2322.04] might seem strange to us,
[2322.08 → 2323.08] especially if we're not
[2323.08 → 2324.52] that familiar with the Bible.
[2325.22 → 2327.08] That we owe a debt.
[2328.06 → 2328.26] Right?
[2328.30 → 2329.28] But this is one of the ways
[2329.28 → 2330.92] that the Bible talks about sin.
[2331.22 → 2332.98] That in our lives,
[2333.00 → 2334.68] as broken and sinful people,
[2334.68 → 2339.24] we owe an enormous debt to God.
[2339.84 → 2341.52] We are bankrupt.
[2342.14 → 2343.22] We have nothing.
[2343.48 → 2344.94] We are in debt.
[2345.42 → 2346.52] We owe God something.
[2346.52 → 2348.20] Because when we live
[2348.20 → 2349.06] our sinful lives,
[2349.10 → 2350.42] when we wound other people
[2350.42 → 2351.12] with our words
[2351.12 → 2352.48] or with our actions,
[2353.06 → 2354.40] it is an offence
[2354.40 → 2356.16] against the Holy God
[2356.16 → 2357.86] who creates everyone
[2357.86 → 2358.82] and everything.
[2359.90 → 2360.66] And so when we hurt
[2360.66 → 2361.48] another person
[2361.48 → 2362.78] who is created
[2362.78 → 2363.92] in the image of God,
[2363.92 → 2366.12] who is bestowed
[2366.12 → 2368.20] with dignity and glory
[2368.20 → 2370.24] as his creatures,
[2370.44 → 2372.50] when we hurt another person,
[2373.08 → 2374.22] God is affected.
[2374.44 → 2376.42] This matters to him.
[2377.34 → 2379.24] And so our sin rightly
[2379.24 → 2380.90] makes him angry.
[2381.76 → 2383.34] What good father wouldn't be
[2383.34 → 2385.40] when they're in light
[2385.40 → 2386.42] of all the anger
[2386.42 → 2387.16] and injustice
[2387.16 → 2388.18] and violence
[2388.18 → 2389.16] and pain
[2389.16 → 2390.50] that we wreck
[2390.50 → 2391.66] upon the world?
[2393.42 → 2395.16] And the way Jesus puts it
[2395.16 → 2396.66] is that we have a debt
[2396.66 → 2398.36] that we owe the father.
[2398.94 → 2400.36] And it's a debt so big
[2400.36 → 2401.40] that we could
[2401.40 → 2403.68] never pay it ourselves.
[2404.68 → 2405.88] And that's why Jesus says
[2405.88 → 2407.84] that we come before the father
[2407.84 → 2409.12] and we need to ask him
[2409.12 → 2410.74] to forgive us our debts.
[2411.08 → 2412.50] We can't pay off this debt.
[2412.66 → 2413.48] We'll never be able
[2413.48 → 2414.08] to pay it off.
[2414.28 → 2415.52] We must ask for mercy.
[2416.08 → 2417.10] We ask for forgiveness.
[2417.94 → 2418.46] And friends,
[2418.46 → 2419.06] that brings us
[2419.06 → 2420.38] to the very heart
[2420.38 → 2421.00] of the gospel,
[2421.14 → 2421.50] doesn't it?
[2422.06 → 2422.84] It brings us right
[2422.84 → 2423.46] to the centre
[2423.46 → 2424.36] of this good news
[2424.36 → 2425.80] that we believe
[2425.80 → 2426.60] and trust in
[2426.60 → 2427.42] as believers.
[2428.20 → 2429.74] That is that this father
[2429.74 → 2431.20] who we are praying to,
[2431.26 → 2432.64] whose name is above every name,
[2433.20 → 2434.94] the father whose kingdom
[2434.94 → 2438.06] rules over all creation,
[2438.66 → 2439.36] the same father
[2439.36 → 2440.80] who gives us our daily bread
[2440.80 → 2441.76] and provides for all
[2441.76 → 2442.60] of our daily needs
[2442.60 → 2444.00] is the same God
[2444.00 → 2445.30] who reconciles us
[2445.30 → 2445.94] to himself.
[2446.64 → 2447.90] And he does it
[2447.90 → 2449.44] through forgiving our debts.
[2450.92 → 2451.10] You know,
[2451.14 → 2452.58] in one of the most vivid ways
[2452.58 → 2454.82] that Jesus wants to teach us
[2454.82 → 2455.86] about the forgiveness
[2455.86 → 2456.94] of our heavenly father
[2456.94 → 2458.26] is in the parable
[2458.26 → 2459.40] of the prodigal son
[2459.40 → 2460.66] in Luke chapter 15.
[2460.82 → 2461.82] Do you know the parable
[2461.82 → 2462.88] of the prodigal son?
[2463.92 → 2464.78] And do you remember
[2464.78 → 2465.80] that in that parable
[2465.80 → 2467.72] there is a man
[2467.72 → 2468.50] who is running?
[2468.84 → 2469.60] Do you remember that
[2469.60 → 2470.60] in the parable?
[2470.82 → 2472.02] There's a man running
[2472.02 → 2472.68] in that parable.
[2473.72 → 2474.44] Now today,
[2474.70 → 2476.84] if you saw a man running,
[2477.38 → 2477.68] well,
[2477.78 → 2478.76] that would be kind of normal,
[2478.86 → 2479.26] wouldn't it?
[2479.66 → 2480.44] Like lots of people
[2480.44 → 2481.06] like to run.
[2481.14 → 2481.92] We like to jog
[2481.92 → 2482.68] for exercise.
[2482.80 → 2483.50] It's very popular.
[2483.50 → 2486.40] A lot of us maybe
[2486.40 → 2488.20] did that at one point
[2488.20 → 2488.82] in our lives.
[2488.96 → 2490.56] I like to walk more now.
[2490.90 → 2491.70] But at one point
[2491.70 → 2492.60] I did use to jog.
[2493.60 → 2495.08] But in the first century,
[2495.56 → 2498.42] running was very inelegant.
[2498.84 → 2498.98] Right?
[2499.04 → 2500.64] It showed a lack of dignity.
[2501.18 → 2502.60] Only the bottom rung
[2502.60 → 2504.36] of society would run.
[2505.70 → 2506.40] And so when we come
[2506.40 → 2507.20] to Luke 15,
[2507.88 → 2509.38] and Jesus tells us
[2509.38 → 2509.96] the parable
[2509.96 → 2511.04] of the prodigal son,
[2511.04 → 2513.58] and a man is running,
[2514.50 → 2515.10] there is something
[2515.10 → 2516.52] outrageous about that.
[2516.84 → 2517.44] If you can imagine
[2517.44 → 2520.20] being in the first century,
[2520.34 → 2521.20] hearing this parable,
[2521.28 → 2522.36] and there's a man running,
[2522.52 → 2523.18] that would seem
[2523.18 → 2524.34] to us,
[2524.42 → 2524.58] you know,
[2524.66 → 2524.82] okay,
[2525.20 → 2525.92] this is fine,
[2526.00 → 2526.66] but to them
[2526.66 → 2527.66] it would have seemed outrageous.
[2528.52 → 2530.12] But then what's even more shocking
[2530.12 → 2531.72] is that it's a father
[2531.72 → 2532.44] who is running.
[2533.28 → 2533.50] Right?
[2533.54 → 2534.56] Not a young man,
[2535.16 → 2535.94] but a father.
[2536.98 → 2538.08] Someone dignified.
[2538.08 → 2540.98] But what makes it
[2540.98 → 2543.02] even more scandalous
[2543.02 → 2545.04] is why he's running.
[2545.82 → 2546.68] He is running
[2546.68 → 2548.20] to greet his son.
[2549.14 → 2549.24] Right?
[2549.32 → 2549.94] This son
[2549.94 → 2551.44] who has cursed
[2551.44 → 2552.10] his father
[2552.10 → 2553.82] and brought disgrace
[2553.82 → 2555.48] on the whole family
[2555.48 → 2556.52] by leaving
[2556.52 → 2557.90] with half of the family's wealth.
[2558.20 → 2559.50] This father is running
[2559.50 → 2560.48] to embrace
[2560.48 → 2561.30] his son
[2561.30 → 2561.88] and forgiveness.
[2562.70 → 2563.90] The father is running
[2563.90 → 2565.02] to forgive
[2565.02 → 2565.80] the son.
[2565.80 → 2568.34] And this is very significant
[2568.34 → 2570.08] because Jesus
[2570.08 → 2571.22] is telling this parable
[2571.22 → 2571.98] to show us
[2571.98 → 2573.14] God's own heart
[2573.14 → 2574.26] towards the world.
[2575.14 → 2576.08] That this is a picture
[2576.08 → 2576.86] of God's heart
[2576.86 → 2578.22] toward the world.
[2578.54 → 2579.80] That God runs.
[2581.18 → 2581.80] He throws dignity
[2582.40 → 2583.32] to the wind
[2583.32 → 2583.80] and he runs
[2584.40 → 2585.42] in forgiveness.
[2586.68 → 2587.78] God forgives sinners.
[2589.30 → 2590.16] And Luke shows us
[2590.16 → 2591.34] that he doesn't forgive
[2591.34 → 2591.80] begrudgingly.
[2593.14 → 2594.18] We don't have to
[2594.18 → 2596.00] convince him.
[2596.06 → 2596.40] We don't have to
[2596.40 → 2597.32] twist his arm.
[2597.66 → 2598.60] He's running
[2598.60 → 2599.66] to do it.
[2600.20 → 2600.44] Right?
[2600.54 → 2601.24] He's eager
[2601.24 → 2602.14] to forgive.
[2603.34 → 2603.64] And friends
[2603.64 → 2604.46] that's the background
[2604.46 → 2606.28] to this prayer
[2606.28 → 2606.94] this petition.
[2607.50 → 2608.44] Forgive us our debts.
[2610.36 → 2611.26] Jesus wants us
[2611.26 → 2612.56] to go to our
[2612.56 → 2613.28] heavenly father
[2613.28 → 2615.46] because our father
[2615.46 → 2616.44] delights
[2616.44 → 2617.32] to forgive
[2617.32 → 2618.52] us
[2618.52 → 2620.32] as
[2620.32 → 2621.52] prodigal sons
[2621.52 → 2622.18] and daughters.
[2622.18 → 2622.30] sinners.
[2623.96 → 2624.82] Now what I wanted
[2624.82 → 2625.60] to do now
[2625.60 → 2626.52] is to invite us
[2626.52 → 2627.50] to spend a moment
[2627.50 → 2628.60] to look at this painting.
[2629.60 → 2631.10] I think it's a painting
[2631.10 → 2631.72] that is probably
[2631.72 → 2633.16] very familiar to us.
[2633.34 → 2633.44] Right?
[2633.50 → 2635.20] It's the famous
[2635.20 → 2636.74] Dutch painter
[2636.74 → 2637.62] Rembrandt
[2637.62 → 2638.94] and it's called
[2638.94 → 2639.62] The Return of the
[2639.62 → 2640.24] Prodigal Son.
[2641.52 → 2642.12] One of the books
[2642.12 → 2642.56] and I'm reading
[2642.56 → 2643.16] several books
[2643.16 → 2643.88] on the Lord's Prayer
[2643.88 → 2645.24] as I prepare
[2645.24 → 2646.82] these sermons
[2646.82 → 2648.06] and one of the
[2648.06 → 2649.36] books I'm reading
[2649.36 → 2650.80] on the Lord's Prayer
[2650.80 → 2651.98] is by a theologian
[2651.98 → 2653.08] named Wesley Hill.
[2654.70 → 2655.90] And he writes
[2655.90 → 2656.64] about how
[2656.64 → 2657.38] he moved into
[2657.38 → 2658.06] a new house
[2658.06 → 2658.46] and one of the
[2658.46 → 2659.44] first things he did
[2659.44 → 2660.86] is he bought
[2660.86 → 2662.26] a framed print
[2662.26 → 2664.08] of this painting
[2664.08 → 2666.32] and he hung it
[2666.32 → 2667.62] first in his living room
[2667.62 → 2668.18] kind of over
[2668.18 → 2668.66] the fireplace
[2668.66 → 2669.80] and then he took
[2669.80 → 2670.24] it down
[2670.24 → 2671.70] and he hung it
[2671.70 → 2673.46] in a room
[2673.46 → 2674.20] where he
[2674.20 → 2675.08] it's a more private
[2675.08 → 2676.00] place in the house
[2676.00 → 2676.78] and he likes to go
[2676.78 → 2677.40] there to pray
[2677.40 → 2679.40] and he has
[2679.40 → 2680.20] a kneeled
[2680.20 → 2681.34] you know
[2681.34 → 2681.72] one of those
[2681.72 → 2682.92] things where the pad
[2682.92 → 2684.20] and the place
[2684.20 → 2684.78] for your arms
[2684.78 → 2685.36] it's a kneeled
[2685.36 → 2686.80] he would
[2686.80 → 2687.52] he would often
[2687.52 → 2688.40] use the kneeled
[2688.40 → 2689.56] to pray
[2689.56 → 2691.26] and he says
[2691.26 → 2692.48] he hung the painting
[2692.48 → 2694.14] at just the right height
[2694.14 → 2695.78] so that he
[2695.78 → 2696.48] was in the same
[2696.48 → 2696.98] position
[2696.98 → 2697.48] kneeling
[2697.48 → 2698.64] as the son
[2698.64 → 2699.18] is
[2699.18 → 2700.44] in the painting
[2700.44 → 2701.42] and so when he prays
[2701.42 → 2701.92] he can kind of
[2701.92 → 2702.86] slightly look up
[2702.86 → 2704.12] and see the father's
[2704.12 → 2704.64] hands
[2704.64 → 2706.10] on the son's
[2706.10 → 2706.40] shoulder
[2706.40 → 2709.54] so imagine
[2709.54 → 2710.30] now with me
[2710.30 → 2710.74] that you are
[2710.74 → 2711.34] kneeling
[2711.34 → 2712.90] before this father
[2712.90 → 2715.52] and what do you see
[2715.52 → 2716.04] as you look
[2716.04 → 2716.68] at this painting
[2716.68 → 2723.52] well
[2723.52 → 2724.98] it's a little bit dark
[2724.98 → 2725.86] but there's
[2725.86 → 2726.48] on the left
[2726.48 → 2727.44] there's the father
[2727.44 → 2728.02] and the son
[2728.02 → 2729.86] there's a couple
[2729.86 → 2730.78] things I notice
[2730.78 → 2733.28] when you look
[2733.28 → 2733.86] at the face
[2733.86 → 2734.50] of the father
[2734.50 → 2736.06] the face
[2736.06 → 2737.14] of the father
[2737.14 → 2738.00] it's a face
[2738.00 → 2739.20] that just has
[2739.20 → 2739.68] this look
[2739.68 → 2740.16] of so much
[2740.16 → 2740.72] acceptance
[2740.72 → 2741.92] right
[2741.92 → 2743.32] he understands
[2743.32 → 2744.40] who his son
[2744.40 → 2744.68] is
[2744.68 → 2745.38] he understands
[2745.38 → 2746.76] that his son
[2746.76 → 2747.62] has made
[2747.62 → 2748.14] a mess
[2748.14 → 2748.98] of his life
[2748.98 → 2750.54] and yet
[2750.54 → 2751.52] he has so much
[2751.52 → 2752.14] compassion
[2752.14 → 2752.84] on the son
[2752.84 → 2753.40] he loves
[2753.40 → 2753.92] the son
[2753.92 → 2755.62] and then
[2755.62 → 2756.88] notice the father's
[2756.88 → 2757.58] hands
[2757.58 → 2758.30] on the son's
[2758.30 → 2758.60] shoulder
[2758.60 → 2759.48] right
[2759.48 → 2759.92] it's kind of
[2759.92 → 2760.54] one hand
[2760.54 → 2761.32] embracing
[2761.32 → 2762.78] the son
[2762.78 → 2763.30] and the other
[2763.30 → 2764.20] pulling him
[2764.20 → 2764.72] closer
[2764.72 → 2765.52] right
[2765.52 → 2766.26] holding him
[2766.26 → 2766.80] close
[2766.80 → 2768.82] and then you
[2768.82 → 2769.62] look at the son
[2769.62 → 2770.32] and the son
[2770.32 → 2772.22] he had run
[2772.22 → 2772.78] off
[2772.78 → 2774.36] but he's
[2774.36 → 2775.22] finally home
[2775.22 → 2776.48] right
[2776.48 → 2777.04] he's home
[2777.04 → 2778.02] just right there
[2778.02 → 2779.86] loved by the father
[2779.86 → 2780.48] and forgiven
[2780.48 → 2782.88] and so
[2782.88 → 2784.06] when you
[2784.06 → 2785.24] and I
[2785.24 → 2786.36] when we look
[2786.36 → 2787.12] at this painting
[2787.12 → 2789.10] can we imagine
[2789.10 → 2789.86] ourselves
[2789.86 → 2791.44] where the son
[2791.44 → 2791.88] is
[2791.88 → 2792.98] right
[2792.98 → 2793.86] can you place
[2793.86 → 2794.42] yourself
[2794.42 → 2796.08] in that same
[2796.08 → 2796.64] posture
[2796.64 → 2798.60] before your
[2798.60 → 2799.38] heavenly father
[2799.38 → 2800.70] right
[2800.70 → 2801.14] are you
[2801.14 → 2801.74] willing
[2801.74 → 2802.70] to kneel
[2802.70 → 2804.52] before the father
[2804.52 → 2806.04] and be held
[2806.04 → 2807.12] by his
[2807.12 → 2808.08] forgiving hands
[2808.08 → 2810.32] Wesley Hill
[2810.32 → 2811.10] writes this
[2811.10 → 2812.12] to pray
[2812.12 → 2813.02] for forgiveness
[2813.02 → 2814.48] from this father
[2814.48 → 2815.90] is to pray
[2815.90 → 2816.54] to one
[2816.54 → 2817.60] who leaps up
[2817.60 → 2818.70] and sprints
[2818.70 → 2819.56] toward us
[2819.56 → 2821.10] throwing dignity
[2821.10 → 2821.88] to the wind
[2821.88 → 2823.38] to offer us
[2823.38 → 2823.82] forgiveness
[2823.82 → 2825.62] before we
[2825.62 → 2826.60] have even been
[2826.60 → 2827.84] able to blubber
[2827.84 → 2828.82] our request
[2828.82 → 2829.86] for it
[2829.86 → 2832.70] Jesus
[2832.70 → 2834.24] invites us
[2834.24 → 2834.74] to kneel
[2834.74 → 2835.20] before our
[2835.20 → 2835.74] heavenly father
[2835.74 → 2836.14] and to pray
[2836.14 → 2836.78] forgive us
[2836.78 → 2837.30] our debts
[2837.30 → 2838.80] and friends
[2838.80 → 2839.46] the good news
[2839.46 → 2840.18] is that the one
[2840.18 → 2840.94] who teaches us
[2840.94 → 2841.32] this prayer
[2841.32 → 2842.12] is the same
[2842.12 → 2842.56] one
[2842.56 → 2843.54] who makes
[2843.54 → 2844.42] this forgiveness
[2844.42 → 2845.42] possible
[2845.42 → 2847.90] right
[2847.90 → 2848.20] remember
[2848.20 → 2848.94] we can't pay
[2848.94 → 2849.32] this debt
[2849.32 → 2849.74] ourselves
[2849.74 → 2850.10] we have
[2850.10 → 2850.38] nothing
[2850.38 → 2850.70] that we
[2850.70 → 2851.10] deserve
[2851.10 → 2851.52] to be able
[2851.52 → 2851.80] to come
[2851.80 → 2852.28] before the
[2852.28 → 2852.60] father
[2852.60 → 2853.60] but Jesus
[2853.60 → 2854.10] makes it
[2854.10 → 2854.54] possible
[2854.54 → 2855.88] when we
[2855.88 → 2856.34] pray this
[2856.34 → 2856.62] prayer
[2856.62 → 2856.90] we're
[2856.90 → 2857.56] affirming
[2857.56 → 2858.46] that Jesus
[2858.46 → 2859.18] paid the
[2859.18 → 2859.54] penalty
[2859.54 → 2859.96] that we
[2859.96 → 2860.56] couldn't pay
[2860.56 → 2861.88] that Jesus
[2861.88 → 2862.44] took the
[2862.44 → 2862.80] punishment
[2862.80 → 2863.36] that we
[2863.36 → 2864.36] couldn't
[2864.36 → 2864.82] take
[2864.82 → 2866.22] that on
[2866.22 → 2866.80] the cross
[2866.80 → 2867.26] Christ
[2867.26 → 2867.78] died
[2867.78 → 2868.36] for your
[2868.36 → 2868.82] sins
[2868.82 → 2870.12] and mine
[2870.12 → 2870.92] so that
[2870.92 → 2871.70] our debts
[2871.70 → 2872.66] are forgiven
[2872.66 → 2873.30] if we are
[2873.30 → 2873.86] in Christ
[2873.86 → 2874.94] because of
[2874.94 → 2875.38] what he
[2875.38 → 2875.84] has done

[2928.36 → 2929.40] forgiveness
[2929.40 → 2929.82] is only

[3009.88 → 3010.38] punishing
[3010.38 → 3011.20] others
[3011.20 → 3012.40] while
[3012.40 → 3012.90] at the

[3013.10 → 3013.66] time
[3013.66 → 3015.32] easily
[3015.32 → 3015.82] going

[3017.86 → 3018.22] forgiveness
[3018.22 → 3018.46] of
[3018.46 → 3018.70] my
[3018.70 → 3018.88] sin
[3018.88 → 3020.76] right
[3020.76 → 3021.08] I
[3021.08 → 3021.64] know
[3021.64 → 3021.86] how
[3021.86 → 3022.22] not
[3022.22 → 3022.44] to
[3022.44 → 3022.68] forgive
[3022.68 → 3023.12] others
[3023.12 → 3023.82] while
[3023.82 → 3024.06] at the
[3024.06 → 3024.20] same
[3024.20 → 3024.40] time
[3024.40 → 3024.82] asking
[3024.82 → 3025.48] for
[3025.48 → 3025.88] forgiveness
[3025.88 → 3027.26] and
[3027.26 → 3027.38] what
[3027.38 → 3027.56] we
[3027.56 → 3028.14] read
[3028.14 → 3028.76] Jesus
[3028.76 → 3029.22] saying
[3029.22 → 3029.40] in
[3029.40 → 3029.66] pretty
[3029.66 → 3029.94] clear
[3029.94 → 3030.40] terms
[3030.40 → 3030.58] is
[3030.58 → 3030.74] that
[3030.74 → 3030.94] we
[3030.94 → 3031.28] can't
[3031.28 → 3031.38] do
[3031.38 → 3031.64] that
[3031.64 → 3033.28] but
[3033.28 → 3033.42] the
[3033.42 → 3033.70] question
[3033.70 → 3033.88] we
[3033.88 → 3034.20] immediately
[3034.20 → 3034.58] have
[3034.58 → 3034.88] is
[3034.88 → 3035.86] is
[3035.86 → 3036.16] my
[3036.16 → 3036.54] forgiving
[3036.54 → 3036.92] others
[3036.92 → 3037.14] the
[3037.14 → 3037.68] condition
[3037.68 → 3038.34] for
[3038.34 → 3038.56] God
[3038.56 → 3038.90] forgiving
[3038.90 → 3039.20] me
[3039.20 → 3039.44] right
[3039.44 → 3039.80] that's
[3039.80 → 3039.92] what
[3039.92 → 3040.04] it
[3040.04 → 3040.22] seems
[3040.22 → 3040.42] to
[3040.42 → 3040.76] say
[3040.76 → 3041.40] it
[3041.40 → 3041.70] sounds
[3041.70 → 3041.92] like
[3041.92 → 3042.26] Jesus
[3042.26 → 3042.62] is
[3042.62 → 3043.00] making
[3043.00 → 3043.60] God's
[3043.60 → 3044.12] forgiveness
[3044.12 → 3044.58] of
[3044.58 → 3045.14] us
[3045.14 → 3046.18] conditional
[3046.18 → 3047.14] upon
[3047.14 → 3047.74] our
[3047.74 → 3048.54] forgiving
[3048.54 → 3048.84] other
[3048.84 → 3049.26] people
[3049.26 → 3050.12] so
[3050.12 → 3050.22] is
[3050.22 → 3050.32] that
[3050.32 → 3050.46] what
[3050.46 → 3050.68] Jesus
[3050.68 → 3050.96] is
[3050.96 → 3051.34] saying
[3051.34 → 3052.58] well
[3052.58 → 3052.74] the
[3052.74 → 3053.02] answer
[3053.02 → 3053.20] is
[3053.20 → 3053.60] no
[3053.60 → 3054.86] Jesus
[3054.86 → 3055.14] is
[3055.14 → 3055.48] not
[3055.48 → 3055.94] saying
[3055.94 → 3056.14] that
[3056.14 → 3056.26] he
[3056.26 → 3056.44] will
[3056.44 → 3056.86] only
[3056.86 → 3057.26] forgive
[3057.26 → 3057.64] if
[3057.64 → 3058.00] we
[3059.22 → 3060.02] why
[3060.02 → 3060.24] well
[3060.24 → 3060.48] because
[3060.48 → 3060.68] the
[3060.68 → 3060.96] rest
[3060.96 → 3061.12] of
[3061.12 → 3061.26] the

[3587.42 → 3587.58] to
[3587.58 → 3588.04] yourself
[3588.04 → 3589.52] and
[3589.52 → 3589.88] as
[3589.88 → 3590.02] you
[3590.02 → 3590.48] reconcile
[3590.48 → 3591.02] us
[3591.02 → 3592.06] to
[3592.06 → 3592.94] one
[3592.94 → 3593.38] another
[3593.38 → 3595.00] Lord
[3595.00 → 3595.20] would
[3595.20 → 3595.30] you
[3595.30 → 3595.54] help
[3595.54 → 3595.66] us
[3595.66 → 3595.74] to
[3595.74 → 3595.88] be
[3595.88 → 3596.40] instruments
[3596.40 → 3596.70] of
[3596.70 → 3596.84] your
[3596.84 → 3597.18] forgiveness
[3597.18 → 3597.56] in the
[3597.56 → 3597.86] world
[3597.86 → 3598.78] that
[3598.78 → 3598.96] the
[3598.96 → 3599.24] world
[3599.24 → 3599.48] would
[3599.48 → 3600.06] see
[3600.06 → 3601.32] your
[3601.32 → 3601.80] gospel
[3601.80 → 3603.10] as
[3603.10 → 3603.48] we
[3603.48 → 3605.00] live
[3605.00 → 3605.42] out
[3605.42 → 3606.18] the
[3606.18 → 3606.60] forgiveness
[3606.60 → 3607.00] that we
[3607.00 → 3607.16] have
[3607.16 → 3607.62] received
[3607.62 → 3608.42] and
[3608.42 → 3608.58] Lord
[3608.58 → 3608.74] we
[3608.74 → 3608.90] need
[3608.90 → 3609.02] your
[3609.02 → 3609.20] help
[3609.20 → 3609.36] to
[3609.36 → 3609.50] do
[3609.50 → 3609.72] it
[3609.72 → 3610.14] would
[3610.14 → 3610.30] your
[3610.30 → 3610.74] spirit
[3610.74 → 3612.20] change
[3612.20 → 3612.46] us
[3612.46 → 3612.64] and
[3612.64 → 3612.98] empower
[3612.98 → 3613.38] us
[3613.38 → 3614.30] we
[3614.30 → 3614.56] pray
[3614.56 → 3614.74] in
[3614.74 → 3614.96] his
[3614.96 → 3615.20] holy
[3615.20 → 3615.54] name
[3615.54 → 3616.42] amen
[3616.42 → 3619.00] let's
[3619.00 → 3619.48] all stand
[3619.48 → 3620.04] and let's
[3620.04 → 3620.72] sing our
[3620.72 → 3621.52] song of
[3621.52 → 3622.00] response
[3622.00 → 3623.14] for
[3635.92 → 3636.38] hear
[3636.38 → 3640.30] and they
[3640.30 → 3652.92] Forgive our sins as we forgive
[3652.92 → 3657.24] You taught us, Lord, to pray
[3657.24 → 3662.58] But You alone can grant us grace
[3662.58 → 3666.86] To lift the words we say
[3666.86 → 3672.84] How can Your pardon reach and last
[3672.84 → 3677.24] The unforgiving heart
[3677.24 → 3682.44] That wounds and wounds and will not let
[3682.44 → 3687.24] Old bitterness depart
[3687.24 → 3692.68] In blessing light Your cross reveals
[3692.68 → 3697.06] The truth we dimly knew
[3697.06 → 3702.28] That trivial thefts are owed to us
[3702.28 → 3706.80] How great our debt to You
[3706.80 → 3712.52] Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls
[3712.52 → 3717.06] And in resentment and seas
[3717.06 → 3722.44] Then round to all in voice of love
[3722.44 → 3727.88] Our lives will spread Your peace
[3727.88 → 3743.78] So we come now to a response
[3743.78 → 3746.00] To the gospel
[3746.00 → 3750.86] In a time of giving of our offerings
[3750.86 → 3754.24] In a time of bringing our prayers before the Lord
[3754.24 → 3755.68] But first our offerings
[3755.68 → 3759.34] In 1 Chronicles 29.14 says this
[3759.34 → 3763.10] It says, Lord, who are we that we are able to give so generously?
[3764.02 → 3765.70] For all things come from You
[3765.70 → 3768.84] And what we now offer is already Yours
[3768.84 → 3772.14] So our designated offering this morning
[3772.14 → 3774.72] Is for our local church ministries
[3774.72 → 3778.34] And so the funds that are collected for these
[3778.34 → 3781.10] Will just be used for the operating expenses
[3781.10 → 3782.38] Of our own ministries
[3782.38 → 3783.80] Our children, our youth
[3783.80 → 3787.28] Cadets and gems, cross-training, friendship
[3787.28 → 3788.32] Our Chinese ministry
[3788.32 → 3791.14] Excuse me
[3791.14 → 3794.30] Last Sunday we resumed our in-person offering
[3794.30 → 3796.04] And so we will continue to do that today
[3796.04 → 3797.36] As the deacons can come now
[3797.36 → 3799.90] And pass the offering baskets along
[3799.90 → 3802.42] And so if you have cash or checks
[3802.42 → 3803.46] You can give that way
[3803.46 → 3806.40] You can continue also to give online
[3806.40 → 3807.26] Thank you
[3807.26 → 3811.50] Thank you
[3811.50 → 3813.56] Amen
[3813.56 → 3815.56] Amen.
[3843.56 → 3845.56] Amen.
[3873.56 → 3899.02] I'd like to invite Kakuna, Argo, to come forward.
[3899.02 → 3906.98] While he's coming forward, I'd just like to say that Kakuna and Salem, they have three
[3906.98 → 3907.98] girls.
[3907.98 → 3913.10] Our church sponsored them over a year ago.
[3913.10 → 3918.96] Just speaking on behalf of the New Immigrant Support Group, I just want to say that it's
[3918.96 → 3925.10] been a real privilege getting to know this family, learning about Ethiopian hospitality.
[3925.10 → 3928.96] So I welcome you all to get to know them better.
[3928.96 → 3934.10] And Kakuna would like to just say a few words to our congregation.
[3934.10 → 3935.10] Hi.
[3935.10 → 3941.10] Can I just go a little bit?
[3941.10 → 3943.10] That's good like that?
[3943.10 → 3944.10] Okay.
[3944.10 → 3945.10] Yeah.
[3945.10 → 3946.10] My name is Kakuna.
[3946.10 → 3951.10] Originally, I came from Ethiopia with my family.
[3951.10 → 3963.10] So for a long time, I was in Egypt with my family before this church is sponsoring me.
[3963.10 → 3971.02] So the life was that so that was very hard over there in Egypt.
[3971.02 → 3973.52] So now we are so very happy.
[3973.52 → 3977.10] So today I want to say thank you so much.
[3977.10 → 3978.10] Thank you so much for helping us really.
[3978.10 → 3979.10] Pastor, you know, this church, that's very nice.
[3979.10 → 3980.10] We are learning from you.
[3980.10 → 3981.10] So, so many things you are so happy.
[3981.10 → 3982.10] You are so happy.
[3982.10 → 3983.10] Thank you.
[3983.10 → 3984.10] Thank you.
[3984.10 → 3985.10] Sorry.
[3985.10 → 3986.10] So after we are coming here really, we are very happy with my family.
[3986.10 → 3992.10] When we were in Egypt, even we can't send our girls in school.
[3992.10 → 3993.10] So that was very hard.
[3993.10 → 3996.10] Now we are so very happy because of you.
[3996.10 → 3998.10] That's why today I'm here.
[3998.10 → 4002.10] Just I want to say thank you so much for helping us really, Pastor, and this church.
[4002.10 → 4003.10] That's very nice.
[4003.10 → 4005.10] We are learning from you.
[4005.10 → 4007.10] So, so many things you are so kind.
[4007.10 → 4009.10] You are so very love.
[4009.10 → 4011.10] So God bless you.
[4011.10 → 4012.10] We don't afford really.
[4012.10 → 4013.10] That's amazing.
[4013.10 → 4020.10] We are learning from you, from this church, from this family, so many things in my life.
[4020.10 → 4022.10] That's unforgettable for me.
[4022.10 → 4023.10] So thank you so much.
[4023.10 → 4027.10] Especially Mr. John and BEV.
[4027.10 → 4029.10] They are helping us.
[4029.10 → 4030.10] I don't know.
[4030.10 → 4031.10] I don't afford really.
[4031.10 → 4033.10] Every day they are with us.
[4033.10 → 4036.10] So I want to say thank you so much.
[4036.10 → 4038.10] God bless your life.
[4038.10 → 4040.10] God bless your family.
[4040.10 → 4043.10] And Joni and More too.
[4043.10 → 4047.10] They are helping us so many times.
[4047.10 → 4050.10] So I want to say thank you so much.
[4050.10 → 4055.10] So really God bless all of you, this church, this congregation.
[4055.10 → 4056.10] And I'm happy.
[4056.10 → 4062.10] If I'm talking English very well, I know what I'm saying.
[4062.10 → 4065.10] So I think I don't afford more.
[4065.10 → 4067.10] So thank you so much for everything.
[4067.10 → 4068.10] God bless you.
[4068.10 → 4069.10] God bless you.
[4069.10 → 4070.10] Yeah.
[4070.10 → 4071.10] Thank you.
[4071.10 → 4072.10] Thank you.
[4072.10 → 4073.10] Thank you.
[4073.10 → 4074.10] Thank you.
[4074.10 → 4086.10] Thank you, everybody.
[4086.10 → 4092.16] Thank you
[4092.16 → 4095.44] We have the privilege now of coming before our God in prayer.
[4095.90 → 4098.38] And before we do that, just a few updates.
[4099.04 → 4102.44] We are really thankful to see Katrine with us this morning.
[4102.44 → 4107.78] She had significant surgery for a broken femur, but she is healing well.
[4108.04 → 4110.56] And we're so glad to see her today and praise God for that.
[4111.50 → 4117.84] You will have seen on your bulletin that Ellie Burma had a fall.
[4118.34 → 4121.16] And she had surgery this week.
[4121.16 → 4125.78] I was going to call to get an update.
[4127.12 → 4129.42] And I called Delta Carpets, but they're closed for the long weekend.
[4129.68 → 4130.80] So I couldn't get an update.
[4131.38 → 4134.88] But we will pray for her this morning for a speedy recovery.
[4135.86 → 4141.00] Also, the bulletin says that Joan is doing fairly well.
[4141.32 → 4146.62] But we have learned that her pain is not manageable.
[4146.62 → 4155.68] And so today, Jerry is taking her for an appointment to see what they can do for her.
[4156.00 → 4158.92] So we really need to keep them in our prayers as well.
[4159.32 → 4160.78] Let's go to God in prayer.
[4160.78 → 4172.18] Our Father in heaven, maker of the celestial bodies and our bodies, of all living creatures and created beauty,
[4173.00 → 4175.14] how majestic is your holy name.
[4176.06 → 4180.10] We see your power in the storm and your peace in the sunset.
[4180.10 → 4186.54] We read your compassion in scripture and experience your new mercies daily.
[4187.54 → 4191.08] You are our refuge and strength in times of trouble.
[4192.02 → 4198.22] You comfort and care for us and walk beside us in times of plenty and times of loss.
[4198.22 → 4206.70] For all of these reasons, in faith and trust, we come to you with our needs and concerns, for we know you hear us.
[4207.70 → 4211.36] Lord, we are concerned for our world and its future.
[4212.34 → 4217.96] We see ethical and moral decay, how we need you as our compass.
[4218.72 → 4224.86] And so we pray for your church to be a strong light pointing the way as out of a dense fog.
[4224.86 → 4230.48] May your kingdom come by your Holy Spirit's work in and through us.
[4231.26 → 4234.50] Remove our complacency and direct our paths.
[4235.22 → 4238.88] May we speak truth, loving each other and our neighbours.
[4240.20 → 4246.40] Wherever conflict breaks down relationships, in government, in workplaces, in families,
[4246.90 → 4249.00] we pray for your reconciliation.
[4250.16 → 4254.70] We ask that you would grace us with humility and love for those who have wronged us
[4254.70 → 4257.78] and those we have wronged, even unknowingly.
[4258.80 → 4261.88] Give us hearts that strive for peace and mercy.
[4262.68 → 4266.16] May we be unrelenting in our pursuit of justice for the oppressed.
[4267.60 → 4271.76] Today we pray fervently for our Canadian government at every level.
[4272.80 → 4276.72] Give our leaders a deep desire to seek the well-being of their constituents
[4276.72 → 4280.38] with humility, respect, courage, and wisdom.
[4281.32 → 4284.76] We pray for the Office of Social Justice and other organizations
[4284.76 → 4288.06] that seek to bring Christian perspectives to Parliament Hill.
[4289.20 → 4292.64] Raise up strong leaders who will speak for truth with compassion.
[4294.50 → 4297.72] Lord, uphold your church wherever it meets today.
[4298.26 → 4299.46] Accept her praises.
[4299.66 → 4302.88] May she glorify you throughout the world and throughout eternity.
[4302.88 → 4305.80] Strengthen the persecuted church.
[4306.30 → 4308.52] May she grow even through hardship.
[4309.94 → 4315.90] Prepare us for opposition, which you have said will inevitably accompany true faith.
[4316.80 → 4322.34] We see it looming closer in a time when the term Christian is met with scorn.
[4323.10 → 4327.88] We lean on you for strength to live into our calling as imitators of Christ.
[4327.88 → 4331.94] Lord, thank you for this church body.
[4332.84 → 4336.44] Thank you for the work of Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy among us.
[4337.20 → 4339.28] You know how demanding their work is.
[4340.02 → 4342.64] Bless them richly and may your kingdom flourish here
[4342.64 → 4345.26] as together we seek to make you known
[4345.26 → 4347.78] as we care for one another and our neighbour.
[4348.84 → 4351.92] Make us eager partakers in this adventure,
[4352.26 → 4353.60] this new thing you are doing.
[4353.60 → 4360.16] We praise and thank you for new members we may unfold in discipleship and love.
[4361.24 → 4364.52] God of all comfort, be near those who grieve.
[4365.36 → 4367.56] You know that our losses never leave us.
[4368.50 → 4370.14] Help us bear one another's burdens.
[4371.32 → 4375.62] For those struggling with financial cares, give relief and hope.
[4376.78 → 4380.14] Jesus, great physician, bring healing to the sick.
[4380.14 → 4384.04] Those mentioned in our bulletin and others.
[4384.56 → 4387.30] We thank you that Katrina can be with us today
[4387.30 → 4389.66] and for the measure of healing you've already given her.
[4390.22 → 4392.34] Will you continue to give her complete healing?
[4394.00 → 4398.58] Today, we remember Joan in her long struggle with cancer.
[4399.12 → 4403.34] Give her health care team a solution to help manage her pain.
[4404.42 → 4407.74] Give her both physical and spiritual comfort, we pray.
[4407.74 → 4411.32] Strengthen Jerry as he cares for her.
[4412.16 → 4415.04] We ask for them a real sense of your nearness.
[4416.36 → 4418.08] Today, we also remember Ellie,
[4418.34 → 4421.24] who has had surgery to repair a broken hip this week.
[4421.88 → 4424.06] Will you touch her with your healing power
[4424.06 → 4426.32] that she may soon be able to return home?
[4427.38 → 4429.10] There are others you know, Lord,
[4429.20 → 4431.52] who face difficulties that no one is aware of.
[4432.26 → 4433.94] Hear the cries of their hearts.
[4433.94 → 4435.82] Bring them relief.
[4436.56 → 4439.66] Give them friends whom they can trust with their cares and doubts.
[4441.02 → 4444.82] Through all of this, we thank you for the measure of faith you provide.
[4446.26 → 4449.68] On this weekend especially, we lay before you our families.
[4450.74 → 4454.40] Married, singles, parents, children, siblings.
[4454.40 → 4458.48] May we be able to talk together of your love and truths
[4458.48 → 4461.26] and share these together in tangible ways.
[4462.18 → 4465.34] Forgive the sins we commit towards those closest to us
[4465.34 → 4466.84] and grant us forgiving hearts.
[4468.14 → 4471.62] Give parents and teachers, pastors and ministry leaders
[4471.62 → 4474.94] the grace to gently guide our children and youth in your ways.
[4476.14 → 4478.42] Call back those who, for whatever reason,
[4478.68 → 4480.76] no longer walk a path of faith.
[4480.76 → 4485.52] Call us back when we walk that path in pretense.
[4486.26 → 4488.66] Keep us from surrendering to the voices
[4488.66 → 4490.74] that would lure us away from you.
[4492.50 → 4496.10] Lord, when we are weak, then you are strong.
[4496.94 → 4499.74] Help us each day to walk in step with your spirit.
[4500.78 → 4503.20] We offer this prayer in the name of Jesus.
[4503.90 → 4506.82] For all the power, honour, and glory are yours.
[4507.18 → 4507.42] Amen.
[4507.42 → 4507.56] Amen.
[4510.76 → 4521.74] Thank you, Marian, for leading us in prayer.
[4524.56 → 4526.34] I want to invite all of us to stand.
[4527.68 → 4529.76] As we prepare to leave this place,
[4529.90 → 4533.36] we hear now God's invitation to a life of Christian discipleship.
[4534.10 → 4537.06] And we also go, though, with his blessing over us.
[4537.06 → 4540.96] And maybe you can imagine yourself as the prodigal son in that picture
[4540.96 → 4542.68] as you receive the Lord's blessings.
[4542.78 → 4543.92] I invite you to hold out your hands.
