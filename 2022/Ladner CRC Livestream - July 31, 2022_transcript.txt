[300.00 --> 314.96]  Good morning.
[314.96 --> 315.96]  Good morning.
[315.96 --> 318.00]  Welcome, all of you here.
[318.00 --> 321.00]  I'm actually pleasantly surprised for this long weekend.
[321.00 --> 326.88]  I thought everybody would be out camping in this wonderful heat.
[326.88 --> 331.96]  But here we are together to worship our God, our loving God.
[331.96 --> 338.06]  I am Marian and I will be your worship leader this morning and we're just keeping things
[338.06 --> 339.06]  simple.
[339.06 --> 345.96]  Norman and I leading in the music this morning.
[345.96 --> 350.70]  So for all of you here, you're welcome as well as all who are joining us online.
[350.70 --> 354.88]  We're also glad that you're with us.
[354.88 --> 360.04]  One announcement, Basic Skills is only a few weeks away.
[360.04 --> 368.06]  And there are still several spots waiting for you to sign up for if you are able.
[368.06 --> 371.82]  And so just check the back foyer table.
[371.82 --> 379.50]  I'm sure that we will have a rewarding time doing that together with the kids of the community.
[379.50 --> 384.66]  Here is one big story of God's saving work.
[384.66 --> 389.84]  Even all through the Old Testament, we see the compassion that he has on Israel.
[389.84 --> 394.96]  That later translates also to the Gentiles, to us.
[394.96 --> 401.84]  God's desire for Israel to be in relationship with him translates to us today as well.
[401.84 --> 407.00]  He wants to have us in a close relationship with him.
[407.00 --> 412.16]  Listen to our call to worship from Isaiah 44 verses 21 to 23.
[412.16 --> 413.16]  Psalm 54, verse 21.
[413.16 --> 418.32]  Pay attention, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel.
[418.32 --> 424.04]  I, the Lord, have made you, and I will not forget you.
[424.04 --> 427.92]  I have swept away your sins like a cloud.
[427.92 --> 431.32]  I have scattered your offenses like the morning mist.
[431.32 --> 438.80]  O return to me, for I have paid the price to set you free.
[438.80 --> 442.48]  Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done this wondrous thing.
[442.48 --> 444.88]  Shout for joy, O depths of the earth.
[444.88 --> 448.78]  Break into song, O mountains and forests and every tree.
[448.78 --> 454.70]  For the Lord has redeemed Jacob and is glorified in Israel.
[454.70 --> 459.32]  Please rise as you are able.
[459.32 --> 462.66]  Our greeting today is from the book of Jude.
[462.66 --> 468.52]  To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,
[468.52 --> 473.48]  mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
[473.48 --> 475.88]  And as God has greeted us, let's greet one another.
[489.32 --> 490.70]  Jesus said that if I threw away.
[490.70 --> 493.70]  Jesus said that if I threw away from you.
[493.70 --> 496.20]  warm up and keep it if it wasn't right.
[496.20 --> 524.04]  Jesus said that if I thirst, I should come to him.
[524.04 --> 533.14]  No one else can satisfy, I should come to him.
[533.48 --> 542.40]  Jesus said if I am weak, I should come to him.
[542.96 --> 551.04]  No one else can be my strength, I should come to him.
[551.04 --> 560.04]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[561.14 --> 570.04]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[570.04 --> 586.04]  Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to him.
[586.04 --> 596.14]  No one else can be my shield, I should come to him.
[596.14 --> 605.14]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[605.14 --> 615.14]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[615.14 --> 627.14]  Jesus said if I am lost, he will come to me.
[627.14 --> 637.14]  And he showed me on that cross, he will come to me.
[637.14 --> 646.14]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[646.14 --> 656.14]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus strong and kind.
[656.14 --> 683.28]  Please be seated.
[683.28 --> 685.28]  Jesus, I'm going to be seated.
[685.28 --> 688.04]  We're just changing things up a little bit this morning.
[688.04 --> 695.24]  And just as we sang in this song, Jesus invites us to bring everything to him.
[696.62 --> 699.86]  And that's what we'll do in this time of confession.
[700.22 --> 703.74]  Please join us on screen.

[725.92 --> 727.96]  Jesus, we are a shield.
[729.30 --> 735.48]  Son of God, who wandered in the desert, we confess that we often get lost.
[736.34 --> 741.84]  With the Shepherds, you find us, pray for us, and God wants to hold.
[742.28 --> 745.92]  Please join me in a few moments of silent reflection and confession.
[755.92 --> 770.16]  In 1 Peter 1, verse 18, we read,
[770.66 --> 780.58]  For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver and gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,
[780.58 --> 787.06]  but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
[794.22 --> 800.16]  Holy, righteous, mighty Lord, your gift of forgiveness is too much to comprehend.
[800.98 --> 805.64]  May your love ignite a flame within us that can never be extinguished.
[805.64 --> 815.02]  Holy Spirit, give us undivided hearts to worship you in all ways through all our days.
[815.52 --> 815.90]  Amen.
[817.14 --> 818.74]  Please rise as you are able.
[818.74 --> 818.84]  Amen.
[825.88 --> 832.96]  Just a closer walk with thee
[832.96 --> 840.68]  Granted, Jesus, is my plea
[840.68 --> 849.96]  Daily walking close to thee
[849.96 --> 858.64]  Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
[858.64 --> 866.36]  I am weak, but thou art strong
[866.36 --> 867.32]  I am weak, but thou art strong
[867.32 --> 876.36]  Jesus, keep me from all wrong
[876.36 --> 884.30]  I'll be satisfied as long
[884.30 --> 889.12]  As I walk, let me walk
[889.12 --> 892.02]  Let me walk close to thee
[892.02 --> 898.02]  Just a closer walk with thee
[898.02 --> 902.02]  Just a closer walk with thee
[902.02 --> 908.02]  Granted, Jesus, is my plea
[908.02 --> 917.74]  Daily walking close to thee
[917.74 --> 925.74]  Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
[925.74 --> 935.46]  Through this world of toil and snares
[935.46 --> 939.46]  If I falter, Lord, who cares
[939.46 --> 950.18]  Who with me my burden shares
[950.18 --> 954.74]  Who with me my burden shares
[954.74 --> 961.18]  None but thee, dear Lord, none but thee
[961.18 --> 970.90]  Just a closer walk with thee
[970.90 --> 978.62]  Granted, Jesus, is my plea
[978.62 --> 979.62]  Granted, Jesus, is my plea
[979.62 --> 987.62]  Daily walking close to thee
[987.62 --> 996.62]  Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
[996.62 --> 1002.36]  Please remain standing for our time of praise
[1002.36 --> 1005.24]  We have a lot to be praising God for
[1005.24 --> 1008.66]  With the forgiveness that we were just assured of
[1008.66 --> 1012.66]  But as we start this song, we are going to allow the kids
[1012.66 --> 1014.76]  To leave for kids' life
[1014.76 --> 1017.60]  So kids, you may go
[1017.60 --> 1026.88]  And we will continue to worship
[1026.88 --> 1033.46]  Lift high the name of Jesus
[1033.46 --> 1037.28]  Of Jesus our King
[1037.28 --> 1041.72]  Make known the power of His grace
[1041.72 --> 1045.58]  The beauty of His peace
[1045.58 --> 1050.14]  Remember how His mercy reached
[1050.14 --> 1053.94]  And we cried out to Him
[1053.94 --> 1058.68]  He lifted us to solid ground
[1058.68 --> 1062.52]  To freedom from our sin
[1062.52 --> 1066.76]  Oh, sing, my soul
[1066.76 --> 1070.96]  And tell all He's done
[1070.96 --> 1076.42]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1076.42 --> 1083.26]  Lift high the name of Jesus
[1083.26 --> 1086.92]  Of Jesus our Lord
[1086.92 --> 1091.48]  His power in us is greater than
[1091.48 --> 1094.98]  Is greater than this world
[1094.98 --> 1099.76]  To share the reason for our hope
[1099.76 --> 1103.66]  To serve with love and grace
[1103.66 --> 1107.98]  That all who see Him shine through us
[1107.98 --> 1111.98]  Might bring the Father praise
[1111.98 --> 1114.98]  Oh, sing, my soul
[1114.98 --> 1116.14]  Oh, sing, my soul
[1116.14 --> 1120.34]  And tell all He's done
[1120.34 --> 1125.68]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1125.68 --> 1132.72]  Lift high the name of Jesus
[1132.72 --> 1134.72]  Of Jesus of Jesus
[1134.72 --> 1136.84]  Of Jesus our light
[1136.84 --> 1141.08]  No other name on earth can save
[1141.08 --> 1144.86]  Can raise us all to life
[1144.86 --> 1149.28]  He opens up our eyes to see
[1149.28 --> 1152.72]  The harvest He has grown
[1152.72 --> 1157.64]  We labor in His fields of grace
[1157.64 --> 1159.64]  As He leads sinners
[1159.64 --> 1161.46]  As He leads sinners home
[1161.46 --> 1165.50]  Oh, sing, my soul
[1165.50 --> 1169.64]  And tell all He's done
[1169.64 --> 1175.10]  Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1175.10 --> 1204.52]  You are my strength
[1204.52 --> 1206.46]  When I am weak
[1206.46 --> 1210.36]  You are the treasure that I seek
[1210.36 --> 1215.28]  You are my all in all
[1215.28 --> 1222.34]  Seeking You as a precious jewel
[1222.34 --> 1226.46]  Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
[1226.46 --> 1232.66]  You are my all in all
[1232.66 --> 1241.48]  Jesus, Lamb of God
[1241.48 --> 1248.02]  Worthy is Your name
[1248.02 --> 1257.66]  Jesus, Lamb of God
[1257.66 --> 1263.66]  Worthy is Your name
[1263.66 --> 1271.26]  Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
[1271.26 --> 1275.44]  Rising again, I bless Your name
[1275.44 --> 1280.42]  You are my all in all
[1280.42 --> 1289.24]  When I am dry
[1289.24 --> 1291.36]  When I am dry, You fill my cup
[1291.36 --> 1293.36]  You are my all in all
[1293.36 --> 1298.36]  You are my all in all
[1298.36 --> 1306.36]  Jesus, Lamb of God
[1306.36 --> 1313.36]  Worthy is Your name
[1313.36 --> 1319.36]  Jesus, Lamb of God
[1319.36 --> 1320.36]  Lamb of God
[1320.36 --> 1332.36]  Worthy is Your name
[1332.36 --> 1334.36]  Please be seated
[1334.36 --> 1335.36]  Amen
[1335.36 --> 1354.84]  Our scripture this morning comes to us from Ephesians 3, verses 1-13
[1354.84 --> 1363.12]  For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles
[1363.12 --> 1369.66]  Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you
[1369.66 --> 1375.82]  That is, the mystery made known to me by revelation as I have already written briefly
[1375.82 --> 1382.92]  In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ
[1382.92 --> 1391.52]  Which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets
[1391.52 --> 1398.08]  This mystery is that through the gospel, the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel
[1398.08 --> 1406.08]  Members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus
[1406.08 --> 1412.08]  I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power
[1412.08 --> 1418.08]  Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me
[1418.08 --> 1422.08]  To preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ
[1422.08 --> 1426.08]  And to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery
[1426.08 --> 1431.54]  Which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things
[1431.54 --> 1437.72]  His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God
[1437.72 --> 1442.04]  Should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms
[1442.04 --> 1447.58]  According to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord
[1447.58 --> 1454.04]  In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence
[1454.04 --> 1458.74]  I ask you therefore not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you
[1458.74 --> 1461.20]  Which are for your glory
[1461.20 --> 1464.36]  This is the word of the Lord
[1464.36 --> 1476.78]  Thank you, Marian
[1476.78 --> 1480.94]  I enjoyed singing along just to the simple style of the guitar
[1480.94 --> 1481.82]  It was quite nice
[1481.82 --> 1489.76]  So we have been for the last few weeks in a sermon series in the book of Ephesians
[1489.76 --> 1491.22]  Today we're in chapter 3
[1491.22 --> 1496.24]  And there was a bit of a mishap with the slides
[1496.24 --> 1497.74]  And so there are no sermon slides
[1497.74 --> 1500.12]  But I would still like you to follow along
[1500.12 --> 1502.16]  So I'm going to ask you to go old school
[1502.16 --> 1505.58]  Grab one of these in front of you
[1505.58 --> 1506.80]  And I know the lights are dimmed
[1506.80 --> 1509.04]  Which is because we don't want to get too hot in here
[1509.04 --> 1512.48]  But hopefully you can follow along
[1512.48 --> 1515.44]  So please do have the text in front of you
[1515.44 --> 1517.72]  And open to Ephesians 3
[1517.72 --> 1520.10]  Ephesians 3
[1520.10 --> 1523.98]  And so let me pray
[1523.98 --> 1526.04]  Before we jump in together
[1526.04 --> 1527.06]  Let's pray together
[1527.06 --> 1529.42]  Our Father
[1529.42 --> 1531.90]  Our Father we ask your blessing upon us now
[1531.90 --> 1533.26]  As we study your word
[1533.26 --> 1536.48]  That the Holy Spirit would guide us in this time
[1536.48 --> 1538.88]  Unto the glory of Jesus Christ
[1538.88 --> 1541.80]  And unto the salvation of your people
[1541.80 --> 1544.04]  And we ask it in Jesus name
[1544.04 --> 1544.90]  Amen
[1544.90 --> 1548.28]  So I want to begin by telling you about
[1548.28 --> 1549.56]  A missionary couple
[1549.56 --> 1552.18]  Martin and Gracia Burnham
[1552.18 --> 1554.26]  They were missionaries in the Philippines
[1554.26 --> 1555.46]  For 16 years
[1555.46 --> 1556.64]  Then one year
[1556.64 --> 1558.60]  On their 18th wedding anniversary
[1558.60 --> 1561.16]  They went on a weekend getaway
[1561.16 --> 1563.14]  The beaches in the Philippines are beautiful
[1563.14 --> 1565.00]  They went to a little resort on an island
[1565.00 --> 1566.52]  And were kidnapped
[1566.52 --> 1570.26]  Most anniversaries don't end up that way
[1570.26 --> 1571.60]  But this one did
[1571.60 --> 1576.54]  Members of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group
[1576.54 --> 1580.56]  Held the Burnhams as prisoners for 376 days
[1580.56 --> 1583.28]  During their time of captivity
[1583.28 --> 1586.48]  Martin was often used as a servant
[1586.48 --> 1588.98]  To carry the terrorist supplies
[1588.98 --> 1593.72]  Through treacherous mountain terrain
[1593.72 --> 1597.04]  But they saw even this servitude
[1597.04 --> 1599.70]  As a calling of God
[1599.70 --> 1602.66]  And an opportunity for the gospel
[1602.66 --> 1605.24]  So every evening
[1605.24 --> 1606.48]  Martin and Gracia
[1606.48 --> 1610.00]  Would patiently share the gospel
[1610.00 --> 1611.74]  With their captors
[1611.74 --> 1613.90]  The terrorist group was also
[1613.90 --> 1616.14]  They were hiding out from the military police
[1616.14 --> 1617.54]  They were running out of food
[1617.54 --> 1620.26]  Everyone was very malnourished
[1620.26 --> 1623.18]  And even though the Burnhams themselves
[1623.18 --> 1624.76]  Were increasingly weak
[1624.76 --> 1626.22]  Without enough food
[1626.22 --> 1629.16]  When relief agencies managed to get food
[1629.16 --> 1630.12]  Packages to them
[1630.12 --> 1632.48]  They shared their food with their captors
[1632.48 --> 1634.48]  And at one point
[1634.48 --> 1636.24]  Martin even repaired a satellite phone
[1636.24 --> 1637.04]  For his captors
[1637.04 --> 1639.20]  And it came to the point
[1639.20 --> 1640.36]  That the Burnhams
[1640.36 --> 1642.30]  Were serving their captors
[1642.30 --> 1643.14]  So much
[1643.14 --> 1645.72]  That the captors would argue
[1645.72 --> 1648.10]  About who would have to chain them up
[1648.10 --> 1648.72]  At night
[1648.72 --> 1651.48]  Because no one wanted to have to do it
[1651.48 --> 1655.66]  Now why would anyone submit
[1655.66 --> 1657.70]  To being a prisoner
[1657.70 --> 1659.76]  And a servant
[1659.76 --> 1661.26]  To others
[1661.26 --> 1663.58]  Under such hard conditions
[1663.58 --> 1665.66]  And yet with so much joy
[1665.66 --> 1667.64]  And the answer
[1667.64 --> 1668.72]  Is that they saw themselves
[1668.72 --> 1669.90]  Not as prisoners
[1669.90 --> 1671.30]  Of a terrorist group
[1671.30 --> 1672.82]  But as prisoners
[1672.82 --> 1674.20]  Of Jesus Christ
[1674.20 --> 1675.62]  On behalf
[1675.62 --> 1677.10]  Of their captors
[1677.10 --> 1678.96]  They trusted that
[1678.96 --> 1679.94]  This was all
[1679.94 --> 1681.64]  Under God's control
[1681.64 --> 1683.34]  And if that is where
[1683.34 --> 1685.06]  God would place them
[1685.06 --> 1686.54]  To share the gospel
[1686.54 --> 1689.04]  Then they would serve God
[1689.04 --> 1690.42]  All the way
[1690.42 --> 1693.08]  And that is very similar
[1693.08 --> 1694.32]  To what is happening
[1694.32 --> 1695.46]  In our passage this morning
[1695.46 --> 1697.78]  So if you have it in front of you
[1697.78 --> 1698.52]  Look with me
[1698.52 --> 1699.82]  Chapter 3 verse 1
[1699.82 --> 1701.26]  Verse 1
[1701.26 --> 1702.58]  For this reason
[1702.58 --> 1703.54]  I Paul
[1703.54 --> 1704.84]  The prisoner
[1704.84 --> 1706.58]  Of Christ Jesus
[1706.58 --> 1708.44]  For the sake
[1708.44 --> 1709.78]  Of you
[1709.78 --> 1711.10]  Gentiles
[1711.10 --> 1714.00]  When Paul wrote this letter
[1714.00 --> 1715.46]  He was actually
[1715.46 --> 1716.30]  In jail
[1716.30 --> 1717.28]  This is not a metaphor
[1717.28 --> 1719.68]  He was often in jail
[1719.68 --> 1722.20]  But who does he say
[1722.20 --> 1723.72]  He is a prisoner of
[1723.72 --> 1725.60]  Not of Rome
[1725.60 --> 1728.30]  But of Jesus Christ
[1728.30 --> 1729.34]  For the sake
[1729.34 --> 1730.30]  Of you Gentiles
[1730.30 --> 1733.22]  But while Paul himself
[1733.22 --> 1734.60]  Sees his imprisonment
[1734.60 --> 1736.26]  As part of God's plan
[1736.26 --> 1737.48]  To demonstrate
[1737.48 --> 1739.70]  The power of the gospel
[1739.70 --> 1741.80]  Even in his weakness
[1741.80 --> 1743.58]  He knows
[1743.58 --> 1745.06]  That from an earthly perspective
[1745.06 --> 1746.48]  Being in jail
[1746.48 --> 1747.64]  Does not seem
[1747.64 --> 1748.44]  Like winning
[1748.44 --> 1750.06]  It doesn't seem
[1750.06 --> 1751.28]  At all like the gospel
[1751.28 --> 1753.08]  Is overcoming
[1753.08 --> 1754.78]  The powers of this world
[1754.78 --> 1755.68]  Just the opposite
[1755.68 --> 1757.34]  And he is concerned
[1757.34 --> 1759.06]  That the Ephesians
[1759.06 --> 1761.14]  Might be discouraged
[1761.14 --> 1763.02]  And we see
[1763.02 --> 1763.70]  That this is what
[1763.70 --> 1764.24]  He is thinking
[1764.24 --> 1765.86]  In verse 13
[1765.86 --> 1766.86]  At the end of the passage
[1766.86 --> 1767.24]  We read
[1767.24 --> 1768.24]  If you look at verse 13
[1768.24 --> 1768.90]  He says
[1768.90 --> 1770.48]  I ask you therefore
[1770.48 --> 1773.60]  Not to be discouraged
[1773.60 --> 1775.56]  Because of my sufferings
[1775.56 --> 1776.02]  For you
[1776.02 --> 1777.10]  Which are for
[1777.10 --> 1778.12]  Your glory
[1778.12 --> 1780.24]  So Paul writes
[1780.24 --> 1780.92]  To the Ephesians
[1780.92 --> 1781.44]  To say
[1781.44 --> 1783.04]  I am writing from jail
[1783.04 --> 1784.60]  But this doesn't mean
[1784.60 --> 1785.22]  That the gospel
[1785.22 --> 1785.80]  Is losing
[1785.80 --> 1787.36]  This doesn't mean
[1787.36 --> 1788.08]  That this temple
[1788.08 --> 1788.88]  And household
[1788.88 --> 1790.18]  That God is building
[1790.18 --> 1791.76]  Is falling apart
[1791.76 --> 1793.92]  This is exactly
[1793.92 --> 1795.28]  How God
[1795.28 --> 1796.74]  Brings it up
[1796.74 --> 1799.12]  So in this passage
[1799.12 --> 1799.84]  Paul gives us
[1799.84 --> 1800.68]  Two reasons
[1800.68 --> 1802.22]  Not to be discouraged
[1802.22 --> 1803.86]  He's writing to the Ephesians
[1803.86 --> 1804.26]  He says
[1804.26 --> 1806.20]  Don't be discouraged
[1806.20 --> 1808.26]  And here's why
[1808.26 --> 1809.82]  He wants us to see
[1809.82 --> 1810.70]  That this gospel
[1810.70 --> 1812.16]  The mystery of God
[1812.16 --> 1814.38]  That is bigger
[1814.38 --> 1815.90]  And broader
[1815.90 --> 1816.66]  Than anything
[1816.66 --> 1818.26]  We could ever imagine
[1818.26 --> 1819.92]  Is still going forth
[1819.92 --> 1821.76]  This gospel that we have
[1821.76 --> 1823.46]  That it is bigger
[1823.46 --> 1825.48]  And it is broader
[1825.48 --> 1826.48]  Than anything
[1826.48 --> 1829.04]  That we could ever imagine
[1829.04 --> 1829.98]  And that's how
[1829.98 --> 1830.92]  He's going to encourage
[1830.92 --> 1833.10]  The Ephesian church
[1833.10 --> 1834.88]  And friends
[1834.88 --> 1835.92]  It is this mystery
[1835.92 --> 1837.30]  The mystery of the gospel
[1837.30 --> 1839.08]  That we're going to look at
[1839.08 --> 1840.50]  Together this morning
[1840.50 --> 1842.40]  And those are the two things
[1842.40 --> 1843.04]  That we're going to look at
[1843.04 --> 1844.36]  How the gospel is bigger
[1844.36 --> 1845.60]  Than we could ever imagine
[1845.60 --> 1846.88]  And that it is secondly
[1846.88 --> 1847.90]  Broader
[1847.90 --> 1849.14]  Than we could ever imagine
[1849.14 --> 1850.34]  So first
[1850.34 --> 1851.46]  This gospel is bigger
[1851.46 --> 1852.50]  Than we could ever imagine
[1852.50 --> 1854.76]  This passage is about
[1854.76 --> 1856.26]  A gospel that is so big
[1856.26 --> 1857.82]  That we are not even equal
[1857.82 --> 1858.62]  To the task
[1858.62 --> 1859.96]  Of understanding it
[1859.96 --> 1862.62]  And so we need to understand
[1862.62 --> 1864.68]  By God's grace
[1864.68 --> 1866.48]  What this gospel is
[1866.48 --> 1868.72]  So look with me at verse 2
[1868.72 --> 1871.20]  Surely you have heard
[1871.20 --> 1872.44]  About the administration
[1872.44 --> 1873.58]  Of God's grace
[1873.58 --> 1875.02]  That was given to me
[1875.02 --> 1875.68]  For you
[1875.68 --> 1877.20]  That is
[1877.20 --> 1878.60]  The mystery
[1878.60 --> 1880.42]  Made known to me
[1880.42 --> 1881.48]  By revelation
[1881.48 --> 1884.58]  Now when you and I
[1884.58 --> 1885.72]  Think of this word
[1885.72 --> 1886.44]  Mystery
[1886.44 --> 1887.90]  A mystery
[1887.90 --> 1889.96]  What do we think of?
[1890.52 --> 1891.50]  What do we think of
[1891.50 --> 1892.46]  When we hear the word mystery?
[1892.74 --> 1893.86]  Usually it's something
[1893.86 --> 1895.14]  That is hidden
[1895.14 --> 1896.36]  That is
[1896.36 --> 1897.48]  It's your job
[1897.48 --> 1898.40]  To figure it out
[1898.40 --> 1900.58]  So I love reading
[1900.58 --> 1901.46]  Mystery stories
[1901.46 --> 1903.26]  And one of my favorites
[1903.26 --> 1905.38]  Is the Father Brown series
[1905.38 --> 1906.48]  By G.K. Chesterton
[1906.48 --> 1907.52]  Has anybody ever read
[1907.52 --> 1907.98]  Father Brown?
[1910.50 --> 1911.20]  I see
[1911.20 --> 1912.10]  I saw two hands
[1912.10 --> 1912.76]  So that's
[1912.76 --> 1913.40]  That's encouraging
[1913.40 --> 1914.62]  Father Brown
[1914.62 --> 1915.22]  So there
[1915.22 --> 1916.06]  There are fantastic
[1916.06 --> 1916.88]  Short stories
[1916.88 --> 1918.96]  It's about a parish priest
[1918.96 --> 1920.48]  Out in the countryside
[1920.48 --> 1921.16]  Of England
[1921.16 --> 1922.70]  And he's also
[1922.70 --> 1923.86]  An amateur detective
[1923.86 --> 1925.52]  Who helps the local police
[1925.52 --> 1926.32]  Solve crimes
[1926.32 --> 1927.18]  And other mysteries
[1927.18 --> 1928.14]  That they
[1928.14 --> 1929.22]  Can't figure out
[1929.22 --> 1929.98]  And the reason
[1929.98 --> 1930.80]  He's able to do that
[1930.80 --> 1931.60]  Is he understands
[1931.60 --> 1933.04]  The sinful human heart
[1933.04 --> 1935.82]  Now when you read
[1935.82 --> 1937.46]  Or watch a mystery story
[1937.46 --> 1938.62]  The truth
[1938.62 --> 1939.86]  Is hidden from you
[1939.86 --> 1941.64]  Until the end
[1941.64 --> 1942.28]  Of the story
[1942.28 --> 1944.02]  And the fun of it
[1944.02 --> 1944.58]  Is it's kind of
[1944.58 --> 1945.22]  Your job
[1945.22 --> 1946.30]  To figure out
[1946.30 --> 1947.12]  Who's done it
[1947.12 --> 1948.24]  As you read along
[1948.24 --> 1949.72]  So a mystery
[1949.72 --> 1950.16]  Is something
[1950.16 --> 1951.02]  Hidden from you
[1951.02 --> 1952.32]  That it is your job
[1952.32 --> 1952.96]  To discover
[1952.96 --> 1954.54]  Or maybe
[1954.54 --> 1955.40]  You can't solve it
[1955.40 --> 1956.12]  In which case
[1956.12 --> 1956.66]  You might say
[1956.66 --> 1957.82]  It's just a mystery
[1957.82 --> 1959.92]  We'll never figure it out
[1959.92 --> 1961.92]  But the word mystery
[1961.92 --> 1962.78]  In the New Testament
[1962.78 --> 1963.74]  Is not something
[1963.74 --> 1964.78]  That you can figure out
[1964.78 --> 1965.78]  If you are clever
[1965.78 --> 1968.42]  Even for Paul himself
[1968.42 --> 1970.90]  Despite the best education
[1970.90 --> 1972.76]  The best schools
[1972.76 --> 1973.82]  Of Jewish thought
[1973.82 --> 1975.26]  Despite his own
[1975.26 --> 1976.68]  Personal brilliance
[1976.68 --> 1978.08]  His ability
[1978.08 --> 1979.12]  To quote Greek
[1979.12 --> 1980.54]  Philosophers and poets
[1980.54 --> 1982.06]  Paul realizes
[1982.06 --> 1983.30]  That his insight
[1983.30 --> 1984.30]  Into the work of God
[1984.30 --> 1986.28]  Would never be a result
[1986.28 --> 1988.26]  Of his own intelligence
[1988.26 --> 1990.50]  Or his labors of study
[1990.50 --> 1991.96]  It is something
[1991.96 --> 1992.86]  That God
[1992.86 --> 1994.78]  Has to make known
[1994.78 --> 1995.42]  To him
[1995.42 --> 1997.84]  The mystery of God
[1997.84 --> 1999.10]  Is not something
[1999.10 --> 2000.70]  To be solved by us
[2000.70 --> 2002.50]  Rather it is
[2002.50 --> 2003.78]  A mystery
[2003.78 --> 2004.54]  It is something
[2004.54 --> 2005.84]  To be revealed
[2005.84 --> 2008.64]  So verse 4
[2008.64 --> 2010.22]  In our passage
[2010.22 --> 2011.04]  It says
[2011.04 --> 2014.84]  In reading this then
[2014.84 --> 2016.38]  You will be able
[2016.38 --> 2017.10]  To understand
[2017.10 --> 2017.90]  My insight
[2017.90 --> 2018.54]  Into the mystery
[2018.54 --> 2019.06]  Of Christ
[2019.06 --> 2019.70]  Which was not
[2019.70 --> 2020.72]  Made known to men
[2020.72 --> 2021.76]  In other generations
[2021.76 --> 2023.22]  As it has now
[2023.22 --> 2023.92]  Been revealed
[2023.92 --> 2024.80]  By the spirit
[2024.80 --> 2026.16]  To God's holy
[2026.16 --> 2027.66]  Apostles and prophets
[2027.66 --> 2028.06]  Do you see
[2028.06 --> 2028.86]  That word revealed
[2028.86 --> 2030.62]  Has been revealed
[2030.62 --> 2032.18]  By the spirit
[2032.18 --> 2034.92]  The New Testament
[2034.92 --> 2036.36]  Uses the word mystery
[2036.36 --> 2037.46]  To explain something
[2037.46 --> 2038.40]  That was
[2038.40 --> 2039.32]  Unknown
[2039.32 --> 2041.36]  That had formerly
[2041.36 --> 2042.44]  Been clouded
[2042.44 --> 2043.02]  In darkness
[2043.02 --> 2044.42]  But is now
[2044.42 --> 2045.84]  Brought to light
[2045.84 --> 2048.58]  Now here's the question
[2048.58 --> 2049.74]  What
[2049.74 --> 2051.70]  Does God reveal to us?
[2052.60 --> 2054.00]  What is God revealing to us?
[2054.28 --> 2055.38]  God reveals the mystery
[2055.38 --> 2055.86]  Of the gospel
[2055.86 --> 2057.02]  As something bigger
[2057.02 --> 2058.44]  Than anything
[2058.44 --> 2059.44]  We could have
[2059.44 --> 2060.76]  Ever imagined
[2060.76 --> 2062.86]  So look at verse 6
[2062.86 --> 2064.90]  Verse 6 says
[2064.90 --> 2066.34]  This mystery
[2066.34 --> 2067.50]  Is
[2067.50 --> 2069.56]  That through the gospel
[2069.56 --> 2071.44]  The Gentiles
[2071.44 --> 2072.52]  Are heirs
[2072.52 --> 2074.16]  Together with Israel
[2074.16 --> 2075.74]  Members together
[2075.74 --> 2076.60]  Of one body
[2076.60 --> 2077.22]  Share
[2077.22 --> 2078.46]  Together
[2078.46 --> 2080.10]  In the promise
[2080.10 --> 2081.10]  Of Christ Jesus
[2081.10 --> 2083.28]  I just noticed
[2083.28 --> 2084.00]  He says that word
[2084.00 --> 2084.50]  Together
[2084.50 --> 2085.40]  Three times
[2085.40 --> 2086.08]  In this passage
[2086.08 --> 2086.92]  In this verse
[2086.92 --> 2088.14]  Together
[2088.14 --> 2088.80]  Together
[2088.80 --> 2089.24]  Together
[2089.24 --> 2090.98]  The great mystery
[2090.98 --> 2092.10]  The thing that is even bigger
[2092.10 --> 2093.42]  Than anything Paul could even
[2093.42 --> 2094.56]  Have ever imagined
[2094.56 --> 2096.30]  Is that the Gentiles
[2096.30 --> 2096.88]  Are heirs
[2096.88 --> 2097.66]  Together
[2097.66 --> 2099.12]  With Israel
[2099.12 --> 2100.46]  The mystery is that
[2100.46 --> 2101.42]  God is not only
[2101.42 --> 2102.02]  Saving
[2102.02 --> 2103.22]  The Hebrews
[2103.22 --> 2104.40]  The Jews
[2104.40 --> 2106.96]  And even more
[2106.96 --> 2107.78]  Than this
[2107.78 --> 2109.38]  He's not going to
[2109.38 --> 2110.52]  Make the nations
[2110.52 --> 2111.12]  He's not going to
[2111.12 --> 2112.12]  Make the Gentiles
[2112.12 --> 2113.72]  Become Jews
[2113.72 --> 2115.50]  In order to be saved
[2115.50 --> 2118.82]  They get to come in
[2118.82 --> 2120.04]  To be the people
[2120.04 --> 2120.38]  Of God
[2120.38 --> 2121.24]  Precisely
[2121.24 --> 2122.06]  As
[2122.06 --> 2123.52]  Gentiles
[2123.52 --> 2124.78]  This is important
[2124.78 --> 2127.72]  Now spiritually
[2127.72 --> 2128.74]  Covenantally
[2128.74 --> 2130.02]  They will all be referred to
[2130.02 --> 2130.90]  As the Israel
[2130.90 --> 2131.62]  Of God
[2131.62 --> 2133.12]  But they get
[2133.12 --> 2134.12]  To stay
[2134.12 --> 2134.80]  As
[2134.80 --> 2135.90]  Gentiles
[2135.90 --> 2137.52]  This is
[2137.52 --> 2139.12]  An astonishing message
[2139.12 --> 2140.26]  Especially
[2140.26 --> 2141.06]  For the Jews
[2141.06 --> 2142.46]  Because to be
[2142.46 --> 2143.46]  A member of Judaism
[2143.46 --> 2144.84]  You have to be
[2144.84 --> 2145.22]  What?
[2146.66 --> 2147.20]  Jewish
[2147.20 --> 2149.90]  Sure you can convert
[2149.90 --> 2152.00]  But when you convert
[2152.00 --> 2152.94]  You are expected
[2152.94 --> 2153.74]  To take on
[2153.74 --> 2154.92]  All of the cultural
[2154.92 --> 2155.68]  Features
[2155.68 --> 2157.38]  Of Judaism
[2157.38 --> 2159.32]  And today
[2159.32 --> 2160.56]  In modern Judaism
[2160.56 --> 2162.06]  You have those
[2162.06 --> 2163.14]  Who believe the Torah
[2163.14 --> 2164.18]  Who go to synagogue
[2164.18 --> 2165.82]  And you have those
[2165.82 --> 2166.36]  Who don't believe
[2166.36 --> 2167.04]  A lick of it
[2167.04 --> 2168.86]  And they are
[2168.86 --> 2169.42]  What we call
[2169.42 --> 2170.40]  Secular Jews
[2170.40 --> 2171.26]  But nevertheless
[2171.26 --> 2172.90]  They would all say
[2172.90 --> 2174.16]  If you're a Jew
[2174.16 --> 2174.80]  You're a Jew
[2174.80 --> 2176.66]  And so it doesn't matter
[2176.66 --> 2177.14]  So much
[2177.14 --> 2178.34]  The dividing line
[2178.34 --> 2179.12]  There is not
[2179.12 --> 2180.62]  Actually belief
[2180.62 --> 2182.18]  But ethnicity
[2182.18 --> 2184.22]  And it's the same
[2184.22 --> 2184.94]  With many other
[2184.94 --> 2185.90]  Main world religions
[2185.90 --> 2186.54]  Let's just think
[2186.54 --> 2187.12]  Of a couple
[2187.12 --> 2188.16]  There may be
[2188.16 --> 2189.12]  Exceptions there
[2189.12 --> 2190.74]  But the main ones
[2190.74 --> 2191.66]  Are also like this
[2191.66 --> 2192.52]  So with Islam
[2192.52 --> 2194.04]  Islam is a little bit
[2194.04 --> 2194.88]  More complicated
[2194.88 --> 2196.24]  Because on the one hand
[2196.24 --> 2197.62]  Yeah it's multi-ethnic
[2197.62 --> 2198.90]  But it began
[2198.90 --> 2200.08]  As an Arab religion
[2200.08 --> 2201.86]  But now
[2201.86 --> 2203.00]  As it's gone forth
[2203.00 --> 2204.54]  It has adherence
[2204.54 --> 2206.90]  From sub-Saharan Africa
[2206.90 --> 2207.78]  From Iran
[2207.78 --> 2208.54]  From Indonesia
[2208.54 --> 2210.38]  That is true
[2210.38 --> 2212.30]  But on the other hand
[2212.30 --> 2213.50]  The true version
[2213.50 --> 2215.76]  Of the Quran
[2215.76 --> 2216.84]  The holy book
[2216.84 --> 2217.94]  It's got to stay
[2217.94 --> 2218.40]  In Arabic
[2218.40 --> 2219.76]  Right
[2219.76 --> 2220.86]  That is the pure
[2220.86 --> 2222.26]  Form of Islam
[2222.26 --> 2223.66]  And that brings
[2223.66 --> 2224.06]  With it
[2224.06 --> 2224.96]  Then a sort of
[2224.96 --> 2226.02]  Cultural superiority
[2226.02 --> 2227.34]  That Arab culture
[2227.34 --> 2228.28]  Is deemed to be the best
[2228.28 --> 2229.36]  Because it is the culture
[2229.36 --> 2229.96]  Of the founders
[2229.96 --> 2231.96]  And you think
[2231.96 --> 2233.18]  You can think of Hinduism
[2233.18 --> 2234.12]  Right
[2234.12 --> 2234.52]  Hindu
[2234.52 --> 2234.98]  The word
[2234.98 --> 2235.78]  It actually just means
[2235.78 --> 2236.40]  India
[2236.40 --> 2237.54]  Right
[2237.54 --> 2238.22]  And if you would ask
[2238.22 --> 2238.72]  A Hindu
[2238.72 --> 2239.62]  They'd say
[2239.62 --> 2240.26]  Well there's not really
[2240.26 --> 2240.92]  Hinduism
[2240.92 --> 2241.50]  It's just
[2241.50 --> 2242.34]  We're Hindus
[2242.34 --> 2243.88]  And it's just like
[2243.88 --> 2244.64]  What we believe
[2244.64 --> 2245.32]  And what we do
[2245.32 --> 2249.70]  You're born into it
[2249.70 --> 2250.68]  And so
[2250.68 --> 2251.18]  But friends
[2251.18 --> 2251.82]  Christianity
[2251.82 --> 2253.66]  Is not this way
[2253.66 --> 2255.02]  Christianity
[2255.02 --> 2255.90]  Christianity is not
[2255.90 --> 2256.98]  An ethnic religion
[2256.98 --> 2258.66]  It has never been
[2258.66 --> 2259.78]  An ethnic religion
[2259.78 --> 2261.28]  From the very beginning
[2261.28 --> 2262.16]  Of the Christian church
[2262.16 --> 2262.78]  The proclamation
[2262.78 --> 2263.58]  Of the gospel
[2263.58 --> 2264.86]  Is that both Jews
[2264.86 --> 2265.64]  As Jews
[2265.64 --> 2266.44]  And Gentiles
[2266.44 --> 2267.56]  As Gentiles
[2267.56 --> 2268.74]  Have been brought
[2268.74 --> 2269.58]  Together
[2269.58 --> 2270.88]  In Christ
[2270.88 --> 2272.96]  And this is the mystery
[2272.96 --> 2274.38]  That Paul is now proclaiming
[2274.38 --> 2275.58]  And what we have to
[2275.58 --> 2276.92]  Try to understand
[2276.92 --> 2278.18]  Is how radically
[2278.18 --> 2279.88]  Uncomfortable
[2279.88 --> 2281.72]  This would have been
[2281.72 --> 2284.80]  Imagine this
[2284.80 --> 2285.48]  The Jews
[2285.48 --> 2286.84]  In the first century
[2286.84 --> 2289.34]  They would have understood
[2289.34 --> 2289.98]  That Israel
[2289.98 --> 2291.10]  Was called
[2291.10 --> 2292.40]  To bless the nations
[2292.40 --> 2294.22]  But what they would have
[2294.22 --> 2295.32]  Never imagined
[2295.32 --> 2296.70]  Was that Israel
[2296.70 --> 2297.66]  Itself
[2297.66 --> 2299.18]  Would be transformed
[2299.18 --> 2301.12]  Into a new humanity
[2301.12 --> 2303.20]  Not just to bless
[2303.20 --> 2304.08]  The Gentiles
[2304.08 --> 2304.88]  Out there
[2304.88 --> 2306.66]  But to incorporate
[2306.66 --> 2307.48]  The Gentiles
[2307.48 --> 2307.98]  In here
[2307.98 --> 2309.74]  And not just to allow
[2309.74 --> 2310.46]  The Gentiles
[2310.46 --> 2311.64]  To convert to Judaism
[2311.64 --> 2312.92]  But to welcome them
[2312.92 --> 2314.90]  As Gentiles
[2314.90 --> 2316.90]  And think about
[2316.90 --> 2317.74]  How uncomfortable
[2317.74 --> 2318.44]  This would be
[2318.44 --> 2320.12]  The Jews
[2320.12 --> 2321.06]  They held on
[2321.06 --> 2322.04]  To synagogue worship
[2322.04 --> 2323.56]  Even in the Roman Empire
[2323.56 --> 2327.20]  They had to speak Greek
[2327.20 --> 2328.56]  All the time
[2328.56 --> 2329.64]  Right
[2329.64 --> 2330.80]  In the daily life
[2330.80 --> 2331.56]  In the Roman Empire
[2331.56 --> 2332.54]  But finally
[2332.54 --> 2334.02]  On Shabbat
[2334.02 --> 2334.90]  The Sabbath
[2334.90 --> 2336.68]  They get to go to synagogue
[2336.68 --> 2338.32]  They get to
[2338.32 --> 2339.92]  Speak Hebrew
[2339.92 --> 2341.34]  They get to
[2341.34 --> 2343.34]  Worship in Hebrew
[2343.34 --> 2343.94]  They get to hear
[2343.94 --> 2345.00]  The scriptures read
[2345.00 --> 2345.60]  In Hebrew
[2345.60 --> 2346.10]  Finally
[2346.10 --> 2347.26]  I get to use
[2347.26 --> 2348.90]  My heart language
[2348.90 --> 2351.00]  And now
[2351.00 --> 2351.90]  For these Jewish
[2351.90 --> 2352.88]  Followers of Jesus
[2352.88 --> 2354.52]  They have to let it
[2354.52 --> 2355.48]  All go
[2355.48 --> 2357.40]  Because the Gentiles
[2357.40 --> 2358.26]  They don't know Hebrew
[2358.26 --> 2360.82]  And if they are going to be
[2360.82 --> 2363.06]  The family of God together
[2363.06 --> 2364.50]  And worship God together
[2364.50 --> 2365.54]  They are going to have to
[2365.54 --> 2366.52]  Let go of their language
[2366.52 --> 2369.60]  And it doesn't affect
[2369.60 --> 2370.50]  Their language only
[2370.50 --> 2371.54]  They had to give up
[2371.54 --> 2372.12]  Their food
[2372.12 --> 2373.16]  Even worse
[2373.16 --> 2375.58]  The dietary laws
[2375.58 --> 2376.78]  Of the ancient Jews
[2376.78 --> 2377.74]  Had to be given up
[2377.74 --> 2380.10]  Imagine
[2380.10 --> 2382.24]  The early Christian potlucks
[2382.24 --> 2385.64]  Gentile converts
[2385.64 --> 2386.34]  To Christianity
[2386.34 --> 2388.26]  Bringing the food
[2388.26 --> 2389.98]  That they were used to eating
[2389.98 --> 2392.88]  And every Jewish follower
[2392.88 --> 2393.64]  Of Jesus
[2393.64 --> 2395.38]  Their stomachs would turn
[2395.38 --> 2400.72]  How can we actually
[2400.72 --> 2401.42]  Have fellowship
[2401.42 --> 2402.12]  With these people
[2402.12 --> 2404.38]  All of their life
[2404.38 --> 2404.96]  They were told
[2404.96 --> 2405.86]  That they couldn't
[2405.86 --> 2406.66]  Even invite
[2406.66 --> 2407.48]  Gentiles
[2407.48 --> 2408.80]  Into their homes
[2408.80 --> 2410.06]  For fear
[2410.06 --> 2411.54]  Of personal defilement
[2411.54 --> 2414.24]  So now
[2414.24 --> 2415.16]  Why is this relevant?
[2416.52 --> 2417.46]  It's relevant
[2417.46 --> 2419.40]  To us today
[2419.40 --> 2420.28]  Because God
[2420.28 --> 2421.24]  Is rebuilding
[2421.24 --> 2422.36]  The world
[2422.36 --> 2424.16]  We've got this
[2424.16 --> 2426.02]  Social renovation plan
[2426.02 --> 2427.60]  That is going on
[2427.60 --> 2429.02]  And the mistake
[2429.02 --> 2430.48]  That the church
[2430.48 --> 2431.74]  Sometimes makes
[2431.74 --> 2432.20]  Is to say
[2432.20 --> 2432.50]  Okay
[2432.50 --> 2434.00]  If you're going to get
[2434.00 --> 2435.32]  On board with Christianity
[2435.32 --> 2436.94]  You have to look like me
[2436.94 --> 2438.34]  You have to
[2438.34 --> 2439.64]  Sound like me
[2439.64 --> 2440.58]  You have to eat
[2440.58 --> 2441.40]  The same food
[2441.40 --> 2442.18]  That I eat
[2442.18 --> 2443.04]  You have to adopt
[2443.04 --> 2444.38]  My language and culture
[2444.38 --> 2446.52]  And sad to say
[2446.52 --> 2447.68]  That has happened
[2447.68 --> 2448.32]  In the history
[2448.32 --> 2448.96]  Of the church
[2448.96 --> 2449.88]  There have been times
[2449.88 --> 2450.34]  And places
[2450.34 --> 2451.16]  When the church
[2451.16 --> 2453.18]  Said that culture
[2453.18 --> 2454.22]  And faith
[2454.22 --> 2455.94]  Were they were made
[2455.94 --> 2456.84]  The same thing
[2456.84 --> 2459.28]  And this is a mistake
[2459.28 --> 2461.84]  And there is no problem
[2461.84 --> 2463.50]  With retaining elements
[2463.50 --> 2465.56]  Of your cultural heritage
[2465.56 --> 2467.80]  But our church
[2467.80 --> 2469.20]  Or really any church
[2469.20 --> 2470.96]  Cannot define itself
[2470.96 --> 2473.54]  By any particular culture
[2473.54 --> 2474.72]  Any earthly culture
[2474.72 --> 2476.68]  We must rather define ourselves
[2476.68 --> 2477.54]  By the gospel
[2477.54 --> 2479.40]  And welcome different cultures
[2479.40 --> 2480.52]  As they come in
[2480.52 --> 2483.56]  If you've been following
[2483.56 --> 2484.08]  The news
[2484.08 --> 2484.78]  You may have noticed
[2484.78 --> 2485.78]  Just this week
[2485.78 --> 2487.04]  This conversation
[2487.04 --> 2488.40]  Is happening
[2488.40 --> 2489.72]  Pope Francis
[2489.72 --> 2490.70]  Visited Canada
[2490.70 --> 2493.20]  To offer an apology
[2493.20 --> 2494.90]  On behalf of the
[2494.90 --> 2495.74]  Roman Catholic Church
[2495.74 --> 2496.46]  For their role
[2496.46 --> 2497.98]  In the residential school system
[2497.98 --> 2499.20]  Which robbed
[2499.20 --> 2499.74]  And stripped
[2499.74 --> 2500.58]  Indigenous peoples
[2500.58 --> 2501.70]  Of their language
[2501.70 --> 2502.32]  And culture
[2502.32 --> 2505.04]  In one of the Pope's
[2505.04 --> 2506.02]  Last speeches
[2506.02 --> 2507.02]  In Quebec City
[2507.02 --> 2508.90]  Just a couple days ago
[2508.90 --> 2510.56]  Before he returned
[2510.56 --> 2511.28]  Home to the Vatican
[2511.28 --> 2512.10]  He said this
[2512.10 --> 2514.10]  Never again
[2514.10 --> 2515.90]  Can the Christian community
[2515.90 --> 2517.08]  Allow itself
[2517.08 --> 2518.46]  To be infected
[2518.46 --> 2519.68]  By the idea
[2519.68 --> 2520.86]  That one culture
[2520.86 --> 2521.96]  Is superior
[2521.96 --> 2522.96]  To others
[2522.96 --> 2524.22]  Right
[2524.22 --> 2525.28]  And that's exactly right
[2525.28 --> 2527.04]  That is the Christian
[2527.04 --> 2528.00]  Philosophy
[2528.00 --> 2530.16]  And so you can have
[2530.16 --> 2530.80]  A church
[2530.80 --> 2531.98]  Full of
[2531.98 --> 2532.36]  Maybe
[2532.36 --> 2533.42]  Old style
[2533.42 --> 2534.66]  British Columbians
[2534.66 --> 2536.42]  And then you can have
[2536.42 --> 2537.20]  A church full of
[2537.20 --> 2537.68]  Old style
[2537.68 --> 2538.46]  British Columbians
[2538.46 --> 2539.06]  Who suddenly
[2539.06 --> 2541.08]  Have Chinese immigrants
[2541.08 --> 2543.06]  Or who suddenly
[2543.06 --> 2543.62]  Have
[2543.62 --> 2545.42]  Iranian immigrants
[2545.42 --> 2547.58]  And we are all
[2547.58 --> 2548.38]  Free to mix
[2548.38 --> 2548.98]  And mingle
[2548.98 --> 2549.80]  And to figure out
[2549.80 --> 2550.82]  Whatever we want to do
[2550.82 --> 2551.86]  With our own cultures
[2551.86 --> 2553.58]  Every culture
[2553.58 --> 2554.26]  Is
[2554.26 --> 2555.50]  Is a reflection
[2555.50 --> 2556.38]  Of God's glory
[2556.38 --> 2557.18]  Every culture
[2557.18 --> 2557.74]  Has elements
[2557.74 --> 2558.24]  That need to be
[2558.24 --> 2558.86]  Redeemed
[2558.86 --> 2561.38]  But as long as
[2561.38 --> 2563.36]  Christ is first
[2563.36 --> 2564.50]  The gospel
[2564.50 --> 2565.54]  Is prioritized
[2565.54 --> 2566.36]  That's what it means
[2566.36 --> 2568.08]  To be the church
[2568.08 --> 2570.04]  And what this does
[2570.04 --> 2570.92]  Is frees us up
[2570.92 --> 2571.50]  As Christians
[2571.50 --> 2573.34]  We can take
[2573.34 --> 2574.64]  Or leave elements
[2574.64 --> 2575.36]  Of our own
[2575.36 --> 2576.22]  Earthly cultures
[2576.22 --> 2577.20]  As they
[2577.20 --> 2578.36]  Help us
[2578.36 --> 2579.38]  Or hinder us
[2579.38 --> 2579.96]  From being better
[2579.96 --> 2580.42]  Christians
[2580.42 --> 2583.24]  We can glorify God
[2583.24 --> 2584.42]  With some elements
[2584.42 --> 2585.22]  Of our culture
[2585.22 --> 2588.54]  And as we do so
[2588.54 --> 2589.28]  We continue to
[2589.28 --> 2589.78]  Welcome in
[2589.78 --> 2591.14]  Any kind of person
[2591.14 --> 2592.06]  Into the kingdom
[2592.06 --> 2592.58]  Of God
[2592.58 --> 2595.02]  This is the mystery
[2595.02 --> 2596.88]  That God has revealed
[2596.88 --> 2598.42]  That he is bringing
[2598.42 --> 2599.54]  The Gentiles in
[2599.54 --> 2601.02]  To mix with the Jews
[2601.02 --> 2602.58]  To make a new
[2602.58 --> 2603.54]  Humanity
[2603.54 --> 2606.14]  So the gospel
[2606.14 --> 2606.78]  Is bigger
[2606.78 --> 2607.60]  Than we could ever
[2607.60 --> 2608.08]  Imagine
[2608.08 --> 2609.80]  And secondly
[2609.80 --> 2612.14]  Not only is the gospel
[2612.14 --> 2612.70]  Bigger
[2612.70 --> 2613.60]  In what it claims
[2613.60 --> 2614.62]  It is also broader
[2614.62 --> 2616.28]  It is broader
[2616.28 --> 2617.78]  Even than humanity
[2617.78 --> 2618.86]  Itself
[2618.86 --> 2620.76]  So read with me
[2620.76 --> 2622.40]  In verse 10
[2622.40 --> 2626.50]  His intent
[2626.50 --> 2628.50]  Was that now
[2628.50 --> 2629.84]  Through the church
[2629.84 --> 2631.32]  The manifold
[2631.32 --> 2632.50]  Wisdom of God
[2632.50 --> 2633.46]  Should be made
[2633.46 --> 2634.10]  Known
[2634.10 --> 2635.48]  To the rulers
[2635.48 --> 2636.24]  And authorities
[2636.24 --> 2638.56]  In the heavenly realms
[2638.56 --> 2640.12]  According to his
[2640.12 --> 2640.98]  Eternal purpose
[2640.98 --> 2642.30]  Which he accomplished
[2642.30 --> 2643.06]  In Christ Jesus
[2643.06 --> 2643.52]  Our Lord
[2643.52 --> 2645.90]  As the church
[2645.90 --> 2647.76]  We take the manifold
[2647.76 --> 2648.84]  Wisdom of God
[2648.84 --> 2650.68]  And we make it known
[2650.68 --> 2654.50]  Who do we make it known to
[2654.50 --> 2657.50]  Not simply to other humans
[2657.50 --> 2660.06]  We proclaim this mystery
[2660.06 --> 2661.66]  To the rulers
[2661.66 --> 2662.76]  And authorities
[2662.76 --> 2663.88]  In the heavenly realms
[2663.88 --> 2665.68]  Now what does that mean
[2665.68 --> 2666.36]  Right
[2666.36 --> 2667.04]  The rulers
[2667.04 --> 2667.70]  And the authorities
[2667.70 --> 2668.52]  In the heavenly realms
[2668.52 --> 2669.06]  Like what
[2669.06 --> 2670.30]  Are those words
[2670.30 --> 2672.22]  Are we talking about
[2672.22 --> 2673.02]  Kings
[2673.02 --> 2674.10]  And earthly rulers
[2674.10 --> 2674.82]  Well
[2674.82 --> 2676.96]  They're in heaven
[2676.96 --> 2679.04]  The rulers
[2679.04 --> 2679.66]  And authorities
[2679.66 --> 2680.48]  Are also words
[2680.48 --> 2681.52]  That Paul has used
[2681.52 --> 2682.66]  Already several times
[2682.66 --> 2683.70]  In Ephesians
[2683.70 --> 2685.12]  So look back
[2685.12 --> 2685.52]  With me
[2685.52 --> 2686.66]  At Ephesians
[2686.66 --> 2687.40]  Chapter 1
[2687.40 --> 2688.64]  Verse 21
[2688.64 --> 2691.22]  We see him
[2691.22 --> 2691.90]  Talking here
[2691.90 --> 2693.40]  About spiritual entities
[2693.40 --> 2695.04]  Chapter 1
[2695.04 --> 2695.72]  Verse 21
[2695.72 --> 2696.82]  Far above
[2696.82 --> 2697.66]  All rule
[2697.66 --> 2698.38]  And authority
[2698.38 --> 2698.64]  Right
[2698.64 --> 2699.26]  Rule and authority
[2699.26 --> 2699.88]  Same words
[2699.88 --> 2703.30]  Power and dominion
[2703.30 --> 2704.28]  In every title
[2704.28 --> 2705.12]  That can be given
[2705.12 --> 2706.54]  Not only in the present age
[2706.54 --> 2707.08]  But also
[2707.08 --> 2708.48]  In the one to come
[2708.48 --> 2712.64]  And when we get
[2712.64 --> 2714.34]  To chapter 6
[2714.34 --> 2716.12]  In that very famous passage
[2716.12 --> 2717.38]  About the armor of God
[2717.38 --> 2717.94]  Do you recall
[2717.94 --> 2718.72]  What it says there
[2718.72 --> 2719.60]  So if you look at
[2719.60 --> 2720.80]  Chapter 6
[2720.80 --> 2722.78]  In verse 12
[2722.78 --> 2725.44]  Chapter 6
[2725.44 --> 2726.02]  Verse 12
[2726.02 --> 2726.66]  It says
[2726.66 --> 2727.88]  For our struggle
[2727.88 --> 2729.30]  Is not against flesh and blood
[2729.30 --> 2731.34]  But against the rulers
[2731.34 --> 2733.32]  Against the authorities
[2733.32 --> 2735.34]  Against the powers
[2735.34 --> 2736.48]  Of this dark world
[2736.48 --> 2738.58]  And against the spiritual forces
[2738.58 --> 2739.10]  Of evil
[2739.10 --> 2739.54]  Where?
[2740.74 --> 2742.06]  In the heavenly realms
[2742.06 --> 2743.16]  Okay
[2743.16 --> 2744.76]  So we're talking about
[2744.76 --> 2745.96]  These spiritual entities
[2745.96 --> 2747.52]  To include both angels
[2747.52 --> 2748.58]  And demons
[2748.58 --> 2750.02]  Paul says
[2750.02 --> 2751.22]  God is
[2751.22 --> 2753.00]  Uniting humanity
[2753.00 --> 2754.08]  In the church
[2754.08 --> 2755.36]  And then the church
[2755.36 --> 2756.40]  Takes this knowledge
[2756.40 --> 2758.00]  To the heavenly realms
[2758.00 --> 2759.68]  And we proclaim it
[2759.68 --> 2761.60]  To the spiritual powers
[2761.60 --> 2762.88]  Why?
[2763.04 --> 2763.76]  Because we are showing
[2763.76 --> 2764.84]  That Christ Jesus
[2764.84 --> 2765.88]  Is Lord
[2765.88 --> 2768.78]  He has defeated the powers
[2768.78 --> 2769.90]  He is uniting
[2769.90 --> 2771.42]  Creating this new humanity
[2771.42 --> 2772.34]  Of the church
[2772.34 --> 2775.28]  He is saving sinners
[2775.28 --> 2776.58]  And bringing them
[2776.58 --> 2777.72]  To himself
[2777.72 --> 2778.52]  In reconciliation
[2778.52 --> 2779.46]  And in reconciliation
[2779.46 --> 2780.42]  To one another
[2780.42 --> 2785.46]  And in verse 11
[2785.46 --> 2786.30]  This was according
[2786.30 --> 2787.88]  To his eternal purpose
[2787.88 --> 2788.90]  That he accomplished
[2788.90 --> 2789.74]  In Christ Jesus
[2789.74 --> 2790.26]  Our Lord
[2790.26 --> 2791.42]  So friends
[2791.42 --> 2792.14]  What this means
[2792.14 --> 2792.90]  Is that
[2792.90 --> 2794.34]  We as Christians
[2794.34 --> 2795.24]  When we reconcile
[2795.24 --> 2796.96]  One another on earth
[2796.96 --> 2799.06]  Spiritually
[2799.06 --> 2800.48]  This changes heaven
[2800.48 --> 2802.10]  Spiritually
[2802.10 --> 2802.74]  We are messing
[2802.74 --> 2803.36]  With angels
[2803.36 --> 2804.06]  And demons
[2804.06 --> 2805.32]  When we bring
[2805.32 --> 2806.30]  New humans
[2806.30 --> 2808.00]  To Jesus
[2808.00 --> 2808.96]  And bring them
[2808.96 --> 2809.78]  Into the church
[2809.78 --> 2812.02]  Now how could this be?
[2813.22 --> 2814.76]  What could this mean?
[2814.88 --> 2815.08]  Well
[2815.08 --> 2816.94]  I want to take you
[2816.94 --> 2817.68]  To one more place
[2817.68 --> 2818.44]  What did Paul say
[2818.44 --> 2819.48]  Earlier in Ephesians
[2819.48 --> 2820.10]  Chapter 2
[2820.10 --> 2821.22]  If you look
[2821.22 --> 2822.52]  At verses 1 and 2
[2822.52 --> 2823.02]  And we preached
[2823.02 --> 2824.20]  On this a couple weeks ago
[2824.20 --> 2825.80]  But Ephesians
[2825.80 --> 2826.92]  Chapter 2
[2826.92 --> 2827.68]  Verses 1 and 2
[2827.68 --> 2828.18]  Look there
[2828.18 --> 2830.84]  As for you
[2830.84 --> 2830.86]  As for you
[2830.86 --> 2832.22]  You were dead
[2832.22 --> 2833.24]  In your transgressions
[2833.24 --> 2833.86]  And sins
[2833.86 --> 2835.18]  In which you used
[2835.18 --> 2835.58]  To live
[2835.58 --> 2836.14]  When you followed
[2836.14 --> 2837.30]  The ways of this world
[2837.30 --> 2839.10]  And of the ruler
[2839.10 --> 2840.12]  Of the kingdom
[2840.12 --> 2840.70]  Of the air
[2840.70 --> 2841.42]  The spirit
[2841.42 --> 2843.14]  Who is now at work
[2843.14 --> 2844.70]  In those who are
[2844.70 --> 2846.04]  Disobedient
[2846.04 --> 2848.08]  Now where it says
[2848.08 --> 2848.46]  Now where it says there
[2848.46 --> 2850.20]  At work in those
[2850.20 --> 2851.50]  Who are disobedient
[2851.50 --> 2853.06]  A more literal
[2853.06 --> 2854.54]  Translation is
[2854.54 --> 2855.34]  The spirit
[2855.34 --> 2856.18]  Who is now at work
[2856.18 --> 2857.80]  In the sons
[2857.80 --> 2859.32]  Of disobedience
[2859.32 --> 2861.02]  Now the NIV
[2861.02 --> 2862.16]  Is trying to be
[2862.16 --> 2862.88]  Gender inclusive
[2862.88 --> 2863.84]  Which is good
[2863.84 --> 2864.90]  In a lot of ways
[2864.90 --> 2866.38]  But in this instance
[2866.38 --> 2867.88]  We end up missing
[2867.88 --> 2869.74]  This family language
[2869.74 --> 2871.18]  That Paul is using
[2871.18 --> 2871.98]  And that is actually
[2871.98 --> 2872.64]  Really important
[2872.64 --> 2874.24]  So we might miss the point
[2874.24 --> 2876.16]  This is what Paul is saying
[2876.16 --> 2876.94]  He's saying that
[2876.94 --> 2877.98]  Before we become
[2877.98 --> 2879.28]  Sons of God
[2879.28 --> 2880.66]  And adopted
[2880.66 --> 2881.80]  Into his household
[2881.80 --> 2882.90]  It is not as if
[2882.90 --> 2883.34]  We are just
[2883.34 --> 2884.12]  Without a family
[2884.12 --> 2885.12]  We are not just
[2885.12 --> 2886.28]  Orphans
[2886.28 --> 2887.26]  Wandering about
[2887.26 --> 2887.78]  In the world
[2887.78 --> 2888.56]  With no family
[2888.56 --> 2889.60]  The truth of it is
[2889.60 --> 2890.60]  We are sons of Satan
[2890.60 --> 2892.16]  The ruler
[2892.16 --> 2892.84]  Of the kingdom
[2892.84 --> 2893.40]  Of the air
[2893.40 --> 2894.82]  And so when we take
[2894.82 --> 2896.46]  A son of disobedience
[2896.46 --> 2897.76]  And he is then
[2897.76 --> 2899.26]  Made alive by the spirit
[2899.26 --> 2901.14]  Having been born again
[2901.14 --> 2903.34]  He is now no longer
[2903.34 --> 2904.60]  A child of Satan
[2904.60 --> 2906.10]  He is given a new father
[2906.10 --> 2907.24]  He is now a child
[2907.24 --> 2908.22]  Of God
[2908.22 --> 2910.42]  So the spirit
[2910.42 --> 2911.48]  Of the power of the air
[2911.48 --> 2913.06]  Has lost a family member
[2913.06 --> 2915.24]  And God's household
[2915.24 --> 2916.74]  Has grown
[2916.74 --> 2919.44]  So one way
[2919.44 --> 2920.10]  That the church
[2920.10 --> 2921.12]  Takes this mystery
[2921.12 --> 2921.98]  Of the gospel
[2921.98 --> 2923.74]  And rocks the heavens
[2923.74 --> 2925.48]  Is by proclaiming
[2925.48 --> 2926.82]  The message of salvation
[2926.82 --> 2929.02]  Helping transplant
[2929.02 --> 2930.56]  Children of Satan
[2930.56 --> 2931.26]  And making them
[2931.26 --> 2932.66]  Sons of the living God
[2932.66 --> 2934.40]  And friends
[2934.40 --> 2935.10]  This is how the
[2935.10 --> 2935.88]  Manifold wisdom
[2935.88 --> 2937.04]  Of God is made known
[2937.04 --> 2938.98]  It's made known
[2938.98 --> 2939.66]  In the world
[2939.66 --> 2940.86]  And in heaven
[2940.86 --> 2942.78]  And do you see
[2942.78 --> 2943.98]  The manifold wisdom
[2943.98 --> 2944.88]  Of God in this church
[2944.88 --> 2946.10]  That word manifold
[2946.10 --> 2948.26]  It means many colored
[2948.26 --> 2949.64]  It's the same word
[2949.64 --> 2950.10]  That's used
[2950.10 --> 2950.60]  Of the coat
[2950.60 --> 2951.34]  Of many colors
[2951.34 --> 2952.72]  Which Jacob gave
[2952.72 --> 2953.58]  To his son
[2953.58 --> 2954.64]  Joseph
[2954.64 --> 2956.58]  Paul is saying
[2956.58 --> 2957.82]  That this new humanity
[2957.82 --> 2959.14]  Is this many colored
[2959.14 --> 2960.50]  Multi racial
[2960.50 --> 2961.34]  Multi cultural
[2961.34 --> 2962.90]  Community of the church
[2962.90 --> 2964.40]  And that it is
[2964.40 --> 2965.20]  A reflection
[2965.20 --> 2967.04]  Of the multi colored
[2967.04 --> 2967.82]  Wisdom
[2967.82 --> 2968.44]  Of God
[2968.44 --> 2970.74]  In a sense
[2970.74 --> 2972.08]  We image God
[2972.08 --> 2973.40]  We bear his image
[2973.40 --> 2974.66]  We reflect his glory
[2974.66 --> 2976.40]  As the church
[2976.40 --> 2977.98]  Is made up
[2977.98 --> 2978.40]  Of people
[2978.40 --> 2979.64]  From all the nations
[2979.64 --> 2982.62]  God is uniting
[2982.62 --> 2983.48]  Heaven and earth
[2983.48 --> 2984.16]  And he's doing it
[2984.16 --> 2984.98]  Through his people
[2984.98 --> 2987.06]  God's great mystery
[2987.06 --> 2988.54]  His building plan
[2988.54 --> 2990.12]  Has been hidden
[2990.12 --> 2992.12]  He's now made it
[2992.12 --> 2992.76]  Known to Paul
[2992.76 --> 2994.08]  Who's made it
[2994.08 --> 2994.64]  Known to us
[2994.64 --> 2995.30]  And now he is
[2995.30 --> 2996.06]  Charging us
[2996.06 --> 2996.78]  To go out
[2996.78 --> 2997.60]  And make it known
[2997.60 --> 2998.22]  In the heavens
[2998.22 --> 2998.82]  And the earth
[2998.82 --> 3001.68]  Bring in the nations
[3001.68 --> 3003.28]  To Christ
[3003.28 --> 3004.86]  Reconcile yourselves
[3004.86 --> 3005.90]  With one another
[3005.90 --> 3007.30]  As humans
[3007.30 --> 3008.40]  So that earth
[3008.40 --> 3009.56]  Is now set right
[3009.56 --> 3011.38]  And as you do this
[3011.38 --> 3012.00]  In Christ
[3012.00 --> 3012.80]  Spiritually
[3012.80 --> 3013.68]  It is going to
[3013.68 --> 3014.54]  Change the heavens
[3014.54 --> 3017.62]  So friends
[3017.62 --> 3019.22]  Let us be encouraged
[3019.22 --> 3019.84]  That's why Paul
[3019.84 --> 3020.62]  Wrote this to us
[3020.62 --> 3021.96]  Let us be encouraged
[3021.96 --> 3023.10]  Right
[3023.10 --> 3024.34]  Though we are lowly
[3024.34 --> 3025.16]  Paul says he is
[3025.16 --> 3025.98]  The least of all
[3025.98 --> 3026.58]  God's people
[3026.58 --> 3028.94]  We are waging
[3028.94 --> 3029.82]  War in heaven
[3029.82 --> 3032.08]  Through Christ
[3032.08 --> 3033.86]  Empowered by his spirit
[3033.86 --> 3035.38]  And this building
[3035.38 --> 3036.04]  The church
[3036.04 --> 3037.42]  Will be built
[3037.42 --> 3038.58]  And as it is built
[3038.58 --> 3039.64]  It is a sign
[3039.64 --> 3040.82]  Of God's triumph
[3040.82 --> 3043.16]  Over all things
[3043.16 --> 3044.14]  In heaven and on earth
[3044.14 --> 3046.00]  Unless the Lord
[3046.00 --> 3046.42]  Builds it
[3046.42 --> 3047.28]  We labor in vain
[3047.28 --> 3049.10]  There are no tricks
[3049.10 --> 3050.82]  There is just
[3050.82 --> 3051.88]  The Lord using
[3051.88 --> 3052.60]  The gospel
[3052.60 --> 3053.88]  As it is proclaimed
[3053.88 --> 3054.94]  To bring sinners
[3054.94 --> 3056.26]  Into his family
[3056.26 --> 3058.30]  And then challenging us
[3058.30 --> 3059.46]  To live out this life
[3059.46 --> 3060.72]  Together as the church
[3060.72 --> 3062.06]  Putting the gospel
[3062.06 --> 3063.22]  In Christ Jesus
[3063.22 --> 3064.42]  As first
[3064.42 --> 3066.28]  Above any other
[3066.28 --> 3067.32]  Cultures
[3067.32 --> 3068.56]  That we inhabit
[3068.56 --> 3069.22]  And come from
[3069.22 --> 3071.36]  So God's mystery
[3071.36 --> 3072.12]  Has been revealed
[3072.12 --> 3072.94]  He is now bringing
[3072.94 --> 3073.98]  About the revelation
[3073.98 --> 3074.86]  Of Jesus Christ
[3074.86 --> 3076.34]  Our salvation
[3076.34 --> 3077.08]  Indeed friends
[3077.08 --> 3077.66]  The salvation
[3077.66 --> 3079.30]  Of the entire creation
[3079.30 --> 3080.60]  Let's pray
[3080.60 --> 3087.28]  Father we thank you
[3087.28 --> 3089.14]  For your many splendored
[3089.14 --> 3091.18]  Your many colored glory
[3091.18 --> 3094.84]  That you take
[3094.84 --> 3096.34]  So much delight
[3096.34 --> 3098.38]  In seeing
[3098.38 --> 3100.02]  People from every
[3100.02 --> 3100.64]  Tongue tribe
[3100.64 --> 3101.16]  And nation
[3101.16 --> 3103.16]  All who reflect
[3103.16 --> 3104.70]  The glory
[3104.70 --> 3106.20]  Of our creator
[3106.20 --> 3107.52]  Come and be part
[3107.52 --> 3108.68]  Of this new humanity
[3108.68 --> 3109.56]  A new people
[3109.56 --> 3110.50]  That is defined
[3110.50 --> 3112.16]  Only by
[3112.16 --> 3113.72]  Salvation
[3113.72 --> 3115.18]  In Jesus Christ
[3115.18 --> 3116.80]  Father that is us
[3116.80 --> 3117.92]  You have made
[3117.92 --> 3119.20]  Us to be able
[3119.20 --> 3119.72]  To come in
[3119.72 --> 3121.24]  Not to become Jews
[3121.24 --> 3122.80]  But we come in
[3122.80 --> 3124.14]  As Chinese
[3124.14 --> 3125.16]  As Iranian
[3125.16 --> 3126.06]  As African
[3126.06 --> 3127.46]  As Dutch
[3127.46 --> 3128.98]  As Scottish
[3128.98 --> 3130.58]  As Americans
[3130.58 --> 3131.52]  We come in
[3131.52 --> 3132.74]  To the kingdom of God
[3132.74 --> 3135.06]  And Lord we take
[3135.06 --> 3135.74]  All that you have
[3135.74 --> 3136.34]  Made us to be
[3136.34 --> 3136.80]  And we use it
[3136.80 --> 3137.80]  To glorify you
[3137.80 --> 3139.08]  We confess
[3139.08 --> 3140.44]  The parts of ourselves
[3140.44 --> 3141.12]  And our culture
[3141.12 --> 3142.04]  That are sinful
[3142.04 --> 3143.06]  And against your word
[3143.06 --> 3144.48]  But Lord
[3144.48 --> 3145.40]  And we come together
[3145.40 --> 3146.42]  And we create
[3146.42 --> 3147.56]  A new gospel culture
[3147.56 --> 3149.16]  One in which
[3149.16 --> 3150.50]  We love one another
[3150.50 --> 3152.04]  Through Christ
[3152.04 --> 3153.38]  Lord help us
[3153.38 --> 3154.14]  To live this out
[3154.14 --> 3154.74]  By your spirit
[3154.74 --> 3155.44]  Help us to
[3155.44 --> 3156.76]  Make it known
[3156.76 --> 3158.88]  To the heavenly realms
[3158.88 --> 3159.78]  That when they look
[3159.78 --> 3160.74]  At Latin or CRC
[3160.74 --> 3161.74]  That they would see
[3161.74 --> 3163.08]  Your
[3163.08 --> 3165.10]  Manifold
[3165.10 --> 3166.00]  Beautiful wisdom
[3166.00 --> 3167.24]  At work
[3167.24 --> 3168.74]  We pray
[3168.74 --> 3169.56]  In Jesus name
[3169.56 --> 3170.48]  Amen
[3170.48 --> 3174.78]  Would you please rise
[3174.78 --> 3175.94]  For our song of response
[3175.94 --> 3193.24]  Let us build a house
[3193.24 --> 3195.48]  Where love can dwell
[3195.48 --> 3199.86]  And all can safely live
[3199.86 --> 3202.88]  A place where saints
[3202.88 --> 3205.10]  And children tell
[3205.10 --> 3207.18]  How hearts learn
[3207.18 --> 3208.68]  To forgive
[3208.68 --> 3211.76]  Built of hopes
[3211.76 --> 3212.66]  And dreams
[3212.66 --> 3214.12]  And visions
[3214.12 --> 3216.60]  Rock of faith
[3216.60 --> 3219.34]  And vault of grace
[3219.34 --> 3222.20]  Hear the love of Christ
[3222.20 --> 3224.80]  Shall end divisions
[3224.80 --> 3226.80]  All are welcome
[3226.80 --> 3227.48]  All are welcome
[3227.48 --> 3227.80]  All are welcome
[3227.80 --> 3229.80]  All are welcome
[3229.80 --> 3231.80]  All are welcome
[3231.80 --> 3235.80]  In this place
[3235.80 --> 3241.78]  Let us build a house
[3241.78 --> 3243.94]  Where prophets speak
[3243.94 --> 3247.80]  The words are strong and true
[3247.80 --> 3251.04]  Where all God's children
[3251.04 --> 3251.76]  Where all God's children
[3251.76 --> 3253.80]  Dare to seek
[3253.80 --> 3257.70]  To dream God's reign anew
[3257.70 --> 3261.46]  Here the cross shall stand
[3261.46 --> 3262.80]  As witness
[3262.80 --> 3267.80]  And as symbol of God's grace
[3267.80 --> 3270.80]  Here as one we claim
[3270.80 --> 3273.98]  To claim the faith of Jesus
[3273.98 --> 3275.80]  All are welcome
[3275.80 --> 3277.80]  All are welcome
[3277.80 --> 3278.80]  All are welcome
[3278.80 --> 3280.80]  All are welcome
[3280.80 --> 3285.80]  In this place
[3285.80 --> 3290.80]  Let us build a house
[3290.80 --> 3293.56]  Where hands will reach
[3293.56 --> 3297.96]  Beyond the wood and stone
[3297.96 --> 3301.12]  To heal and strengthen
[3301.12 --> 3303.24]  Serve and teach
[3303.24 --> 3306.80]  And live the word they've known
[3306.80 --> 3309.80]  Hear the outcast
[3309.80 --> 3310.26]  Hear the outcast
[3310.26 --> 3311.80]  And the stranger
[3311.80 --> 3313.80]  Bear the image
[3313.80 --> 3314.80]  Bear the image
[3314.80 --> 3316.80]  Of God's face
[3316.80 --> 3319.80]  Let us bring an end
[3319.80 --> 3321.80]  To fear and danger
[3321.80 --> 3324.80]  All are welcome
[3324.80 --> 3327.80]  All are welcome
[3327.80 --> 3328.80]  All are welcome
[3328.80 --> 3330.80]  In this place
[3330.80 --> 3333.80]  All are welcome
[3333.80 --> 3335.80]  All are welcome
[3335.80 --> 3339.12]  You may be seated.
[3347.66 --> 3349.12]  I did a musician.
[3349.82 --> 3352.16]  Is that they take their picks somewhere else.
[3352.26 --> 3353.44]  But anyway, I'm playing without one.
[3353.84 --> 3358.28]  We're having an offering this morning for UBC Okanagan.
[3358.86 --> 3363.38]  And if you remember, Todd Statham was with us a few weeks ago.
[3363.38 --> 3364.94]  And he is the chaplain there.
[3364.94 --> 3369.80]  And it is for his work that we support him today.
[3370.48 --> 3373.28]  So I will ask the deacons to come forth.
[3373.54 --> 3375.40]  And take up the offering.
[3375.96 --> 3380.80]  And while they do that, I would like to teach you a Bible verse in song.
[3380.92 --> 3382.60]  One that maybe you can take with you.
[3382.96 --> 3384.74]  And just sing.
[3384.88 --> 3391.74]  It's from Jude 1 verse 25 from the King James Version.
[3391.74 --> 3396.04]  And this came to me because we were listening to our Hawaiian list in the heat this week.
[3396.42 --> 3398.56]  And it's kind of a little Hawaiian tune.
[3398.68 --> 3402.20]  But if you listen to it once, you can sing it the second and third times with me.
[3402.20 --> 3403.20]  Sing it with me.
[3403.20 --> 3404.20]  Sing it with me.
[3404.20 --> 3405.94]  Sing it with me.
[3405.94 --> 3407.94]  Sing it with me.
[3407.94 --> 3409.94]  Sing it with me.
[3409.94 --> 3411.94]  Sing it with me.
[3411.94 --> 3413.94]  Sing it with me.
[3413.94 --> 3418.94]  Sing it with me.
[3418.94 --> 3420.94]  Dominion and power.
[3420.94 --> 3422.94]  Dominion and power.
[3422.94 --> 3424.94]  Now and forever.
[3424.94 --> 3425.94]  Amen.
[3425.94 --> 3427.94]  Sing it with me.
[3427.94 --> 3429.94]  Sing it with me.
[3429.94 --> 3431.94]  Sing it with me.
[3431.94 --> 3436.94]  To the only wise God.
[3436.94 --> 3437.94]  To the only wise God.
[3437.94 --> 3438.94]  Our Savior.
[3438.94 --> 3444.94]  nuns to the glory and majesty.
[3444.94 --> 3447.94]  тому .
[3447.94 --> 3459.94]  Now and forever.
[3459.94 --> 3477.06]  Our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and forever. Amen.
[3479.80 --> 3486.04]  Hopefully you can remember that tune and sing it and mess with the spiritual forces while you sing it.
[3489.94 --> 3490.42]  Amen.
[3496.00 --> 3505.56]  So in the great revelation that was given to the Apostle John of what is to come and what is right now,
[3505.76 --> 3512.84]  we see in Revelation chapter 8 that after the seventh seal was opened, there was silence in heaven.
[3514.28 --> 3518.02]  And during that silence, which it says I believe is half an hour,
[3518.02 --> 3523.58]  as all of heaven was straining to see what would happen next,
[3524.50 --> 3534.52]  another angel came who had a great golden censer and stood before the altar of God and offered it up with the prayers of God's people.
[3534.52 --> 3543.34]  So friends, the prayers that we are about to offer, all of our prayers we have offered already this morning,
[3544.10 --> 3548.00]  all of heaven strains to listen.
[3549.30 --> 3553.36]  God pays attention to what you're about to pray.
[3553.36 --> 3562.78]  So let's join together and bring our prayers of supplication to God, who is indeed listening.
[3564.64 --> 3567.74]  And so I will lead us for a bit and I'm going to say something to pray for,
[3567.82 --> 3572.74]  and I'm going to give a moment of silence and ask you to name all the particular things,
[3573.34 --> 3575.56]  particular prayers that go along with that.
[3575.68 --> 3577.54]  So please join me in prayer.
[3577.54 --> 3581.84]  Lord, we come to you.
[3582.82 --> 3584.78]  Our help in ages past,
[3585.46 --> 3588.08]  our hope in present need,
[3588.80 --> 3592.04]  the one who will be our eternal home,
[3593.08 --> 3596.38]  and who even now would wish to tell us that all of heaven
[3596.38 --> 3598.20]  is silenced,
[3598.58 --> 3601.20]  so that you could hear our prayers.
[3601.20 --> 3604.40]  And so with humility,
[3604.90 --> 3605.92]  we come before you,
[3606.50 --> 3608.66]  but also with confidence.
[3610.80 --> 3615.66]  Some of us, Lord, have been walking through tremendous difficulties,
[3616.48 --> 3618.28]  and our hearts
[3618.28 --> 3620.20]  really
[3620.20 --> 3621.54]  are heavy.
[3623.30 --> 3624.48]  And so now, Lord,
[3625.12 --> 3627.08]  in a space of silence,
[3627.08 --> 3631.48]  we raise these concerns to you in our hearts.
[3631.48 --> 3633.48]  Thank you.
[3657.08 --> 3669.12]  Some of us have a family member,
[3670.00 --> 3671.98]  a neighbor,
[3673.50 --> 3674.80]  a colleague at work,
[3675.48 --> 3677.40]  a friend from school
[3677.40 --> 3680.38]  who has yet to know the love of Jesus.
[3681.68 --> 3684.88]  Maybe you yourselves have questions about faith.
[3684.88 --> 3687.46]  Let us all together,
[3687.58 --> 3689.58]  in the silence of our hearts,
[3690.46 --> 3691.84]  raise up by name
[3691.84 --> 3693.10]  these people
[3693.10 --> 3695.58]  who we long to know
[3695.58 --> 3697.48]  the forgiveness of Jesus Christ.
[3697.48 --> 3697.68]  Amen.
[3714.88 --> 3731.26]  There are those among us,
[3731.52 --> 3732.66]  and those whom we know,
[3733.10 --> 3734.22]  even in the church,
[3735.16 --> 3736.48]  that have experienced
[3736.48 --> 3737.64]  tremendous
[3737.64 --> 3739.30]  abuse.
[3740.72 --> 3742.16]  At the hands of those
[3742.16 --> 3743.68]  whom should have been trusted,
[3743.68 --> 3747.18]  and Father,
[3747.34 --> 3748.50]  as some of us
[3748.50 --> 3751.02]  maybe have followed the news
[3751.02 --> 3752.02]  of the Pope's visit
[3752.02 --> 3753.24]  and his apology
[3753.24 --> 3754.82]  to the First Nations communities,
[3755.24 --> 3756.58]  our hearts also break
[3756.58 --> 3758.38]  at the abusive treatment
[3758.38 --> 3759.70]  of indigenous people
[3759.70 --> 3760.38]  in this land.
[3761.50 --> 3762.16]  And so we ask
[3762.16 --> 3763.42]  for your redemptive power.
[3764.72 --> 3765.96]  We ask and pray
[3765.96 --> 3766.92]  for our church
[3766.92 --> 3767.90]  throughout the world,
[3769.14 --> 3770.06]  the church
[3770.06 --> 3771.02]  throughout this nation,
[3771.02 --> 3773.26]  and even here in Lanner,
[3774.24 --> 3775.50]  that we would be
[3775.50 --> 3776.82]  a place of holiness
[3776.82 --> 3778.98]  and shelter
[3778.98 --> 3780.46]  for those who have
[3780.46 --> 3781.74]  experienced abuse.
[3781.74 --> 3802.18]  so Lord,
[3802.24 --> 3803.04]  we come to you,
[3803.18 --> 3804.66]  the one who has created us,
[3804.96 --> 3806.42]  the one who has formed us,
[3806.52 --> 3807.62]  the one who has told us,
[3807.86 --> 3808.50]  do not fear,
[3808.60 --> 3809.92]  for I have redeemed you.
[3809.92 --> 3811.66]  I have summoned you
[3811.66 --> 3812.40]  by name,
[3812.54 --> 3813.44]  you are mine.
[3814.26 --> 3815.22]  And when we pass
[3815.22 --> 3815.92]  through the waters,
[3816.04 --> 3816.94]  you will be with us.
[3817.56 --> 3818.50]  And when we pass
[3818.50 --> 3819.34]  through the rivers,
[3820.38 --> 3821.84]  you will not sweep over us,
[3821.90 --> 3823.22]  or they will not sweep over us.
[3824.06 --> 3824.94]  When we walk
[3824.94 --> 3825.74]  through the fire,
[3826.58 --> 3827.72]  we will not be burned.
[3828.20 --> 3828.70]  The flames
[3828.70 --> 3830.00]  will not set us ablaze,
[3830.08 --> 3830.52]  for you
[3830.52 --> 3832.08]  are the Lord,
[3832.14 --> 3832.62]  our God,
[3832.70 --> 3834.02]  the Holy One of Israel,
[3834.32 --> 3834.86]  our Savior.
[3836.08 --> 3836.48]  And so,
[3836.56 --> 3836.72]  Father,
[3836.82 --> 3837.36]  we thank you.
[3837.36 --> 3838.22]  We thank you that
[3838.22 --> 3840.36]  we can come before you
[3840.36 --> 3841.96]  with our own needs
[3841.96 --> 3844.38]  and know with confidence
[3844.38 --> 3846.18]  that you have strained your ear
[3846.18 --> 3847.60]  and that you have been attentive
[3847.60 --> 3849.92]  and you have heard us.
[3851.02 --> 3851.68]  You have heard
[3851.68 --> 3853.12]  our hearts.
[3854.78 --> 3856.14]  In the name of Jesus,
[3856.76 --> 3857.50]  we pray.
[3858.20 --> 3858.60]  Amen.
[3860.60 --> 3861.54]  Brothers and sisters,
[3861.68 --> 3862.38]  please stand.
[3862.38 --> 3864.98]  Lift up your hands
[3864.98 --> 3866.58]  and receive God's word
[3866.58 --> 3867.94]  spoken over you.
[3869.44 --> 3869.82]  Actually,
[3869.92 --> 3871.14]  can we put up the song lyrics?
[3871.30 --> 3872.12]  That's a good benediction
[3872.12 --> 3873.34]  that we just did.
[3877.40 --> 3878.18]  That's not it.
[3878.50 --> 3878.66]  Yeah.
[3879.18 --> 3879.40]  Ready?
[3880.22 --> 3881.52]  To the only wise God,
[3881.58 --> 3882.08]  our Savior,
[3882.28 --> 3883.56]  be glory and majesty,
[3884.06 --> 3885.14]  dominion and power,
[3885.66 --> 3886.68]  now and forever.
[3887.44 --> 3887.80]  Amen.
[3887.80 --> 3887.90]  Amen.
[3887.90 --> 3887.94]  Amen.
[3892.38 --> 3906.38]  Let all things now living
[3906.38 --> 3909.82]  a song of thanksgiving
[3909.82 --> 3913.16]  to God the Creator
[3913.16 --> 3916.82]  triumphantly raised,
[3916.82 --> 3920.32]  who fashioned and made us
[3920.32 --> 3923.72]  protected and stayed us,
[3923.98 --> 3926.16]  who still brought us
[3926.16 --> 3930.32]  on to the end of our days.
[3930.68 --> 3933.88]  His banners are o'er us,
[3934.14 --> 3937.26]  His light goes before us,
[3937.52 --> 3940.96]  a pillar of fire shining
[3940.96 --> 3944.02]  forth in the night,
[3944.02 --> 3947.50]  till shadows have vanished
[3947.50 --> 3950.90]  and darkness is banished.
[3950.90 --> 3954.22]  As forward we travel
[3954.22 --> 3958.46]  from light into light.
[3959.34 --> 3962.78]  His law He enforces,
[3963.14 --> 3966.04]  the stars in their courses,
[3966.62 --> 3969.62]  the sun in His orbit
[3969.62 --> 3972.86]  obediently shine.
[3973.42 --> 3976.56]  The hills and the mountains,
[3976.56 --> 3980.06]  the rivers and fountains,
[3980.06 --> 3983.36]  the deeps of the ocean,
[3983.76 --> 3986.74]  proclaim Him divine.
[3987.20 --> 3990.38]  We too should be voicing
[3990.38 --> 3993.82]  our love and rejoicing,
[3994.16 --> 3997.10]  with glad adoration,
[3997.66 --> 4000.82]  a song let us raise.
[4000.82 --> 4004.32]  Till all things now living
[4004.32 --> 4007.76]  unite in thanksgiving
[4007.76 --> 4011.46]  to God in the highest,
[4011.46 --> 4015.46]  Hosanna and praise.
[4015.46 --> 4033.48]  very esteem is my name,
[4033.48 --> 4035.02]  holiness know each building
[4035.26 --> 4036.84]  숙 for you from new
[4036.84 --> 4037.86]  Thy place where Chile has been
[4038.26 --> 4039.42]  cooped in and over asooth
[4039.42 --> 4041.04]  earth in and over the world.
[4041.04 --> 4042.04]  Amen.
