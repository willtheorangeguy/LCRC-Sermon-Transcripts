[533.00 → 539.00] We shall first watch a slide presentation put together as memories of Hank.
[540.00 → 543.00] And these were put together by granddaughter Krista.
[553.00 → 563.00] When peace like a river attended my way.
[563.00 → 564.00] When sorrow's like sea billows fall.
[564.00 → 568.00] Whatever my life Thou hast taught me to say.
[568.00 → 569.00] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[569.00 → 575.00] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[575.00 → 576.00] It is well.
[576.00 → 600.00] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[600.00 → 604.08] With my soul
[604.08 → 609.60] It is well, it is well
[609.60 → 612.66] With my soul
[612.66 → 619.90] My sin, O the bliss
[619.90 → 625.44] Of this glorious thought
[625.44 → 630.24] My sin, not in part
[630.24 → 634.14] But the whole
[634.14 → 641.06] Is nailed to the cross
[641.06 → 646.06] And I bear it no more
[646.06 → 651.52] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
[651.52 → 655.44] Oh, my soul
[655.44 → 659.32] It is well
[659.32 → 661.72] It is well
[661.72 → 664.38] With my soul
[664.38 → 666.54] With my soul
[666.54 → 669.42] It is well
[669.42 → 672.12] It is well
[672.12 → 675.16] With my soul
[675.16 → 679.86] And Lord
[679.86 → 682.54] It is the day
[682.54 → 687.86] When my face shall be sight
[687.86 → 692.74] The clouds be rolled back
[692.74 → 695.04] As us grow
[695.04 → 703.14] The trump shall resound
[703.14 → 707.84] And the Lord shall descend
[707.84 → 711.12] Even so
[711.12 → 713.84] It is well
[713.84 → 717.38] With my soul
[717.38 → 721.30] It is well
[721.30 → 723.76] It is well
[723.76 → 727.08] With my soul
[727.08 → 729.08] With my soul
[729.08 → 732.12] It is well
[732.12 → 734.18] It is well
[734.18 → 738.18] With my soul
[738.18 → 745.78] It is well
[745.78 → 764.06] It is well
[764.06 → 772.12] All to Jesus I surrender
[772.12 → 778.22] All to Him, I freely give
[778.22 → 785.20] I will ever love and trust Him
[785.20 → 790.86] In His presence daily living
[790.86 → 796.86] I surrender all
[796.86 → 802.86] I surrender all
[802.86 → 808.86] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour
[808.86 → 814.86] I surrender all
[814.86 → 820.86] All to Jesus I surrender
[820.86 → 826.86] Humbly at His feet I bow
[826.86 → 832.86] Worldly pleasures all forsaken
[832.86 → 838.86] Take me, Jesus, take me now
[838.86 → 844.86] I surrender all
[844.86 → 850.86] I surrender all
[850.86 → 856.86] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour
[856.86 → 862.86] I surrender all
[862.86 → 866.86] I surrender all
[866.86 → 870.86] I surrender all
[870.86 → 876.86] I surrender all
[876.86 → 882.86] All to Thee, my blessed Saviour
[882.86 → 884.86] I surrender all
[884.86 → 886.86] I surrender all
[886.86 → 888.86] I surrender all
[888.86 → 895.86] Here
[895.86 → 898.86] I surrender all
[898.86 → 900.86] I surrender all
[900.86 → 902.86] I surrender all
[902.86 → 903.22] You're next
[903.22 → 918.84] If you wish
[918.84 → 922.92] Your face is before me.
[923.68 → 925.82] I can only imagine.
[929.82 → 930.86] Yeah.
[936.60 → 942.08] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart fear?
[942.08 → 948.16] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in awe of you be still?
[948.16 → 951.20] Will I stand in your presence?
[951.60 → 953.96] Or to my knees will I fall?
[954.42 → 956.92] Will I sing hallelujah?
[957.46 → 960.00] Will I be able to speak at all?
[960.10 → 962.26] I can only imagine.
[965.38 → 967.52] I can only imagine.
[971.46 → 973.92] I can only imagine.
[974.92 → 977.22] When that day comes.
[978.16 → 982.96] And I find myself standing in the sun.
[983.84 → 985.88] I can only imagine.
[987.20 → 991.46] When all I would do is forever.
[992.92 → 995.20] Forever worship you.
[995.20 → 996.92] I can only imagine.
[996.92 → 997.92] I can only imagine.
[997.92 → 998.38] Yeah.
[1001.38 → 1003.92] I can only imagine.
[1008.88 → 1013.96] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart fear?
[1013.96 → 1020.18] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in awe of you be still?
[1020.18 → 1023.18] Will I stand in your presence?
[1023.18 → 1024.18] Or to my knees.
[1024.18 → 1025.90] Or to my knees will I fall?
[1025.90 → 1028.90] Will I sing hallelujah?
[1028.90 → 1032.02] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1032.02 → 1033.02] I can only imagine.
[1033.02 → 1034.06] I can only imagine.
[1034.06 → 1034.32] I can only imagine.
[1034.32 → 1035.80] I can only imagine.
[1035.80 → 1036.02] Yeah.
[1036.02 → 1039.02] I can only imagine.
[1039.02 → 1040.24] I can only imagine.
[1040.24 → 1043.24] I can only imagine.
[1043.24 → 1050.08] Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
[1050.08 → 1059.22] Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in awe of you be still?
[1059.22 → 1064.92] To my knees will I fall, will I sing hallelujah
[1064.92 → 1069.60] Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine
[1069.60 → 1075.62] I can only imagine
[1075.62 → 1081.58] I can only imagine
[1081.58 → 1087.60] I can only imagine
[1089.22 → 1096.22] I can only imagine
[1096.22 → 1099.66] I can only imagine
[1119.22 → 1126.22] Wow, don't those pictures tell of a lifetime of memories?
[1126.22 → 1148.22] On behalf of Jean, son Anthony, grandchildren Krista, Alec, Sean, Kyle, of great-grandchildren James, Leah, and Mackenzie, I want to welcome everyone here this afternoon, and thank you for joining us in this memorial service.
[1148.22 → 1160.22] Jean, Anthony, and family also wish to thank all who have come alongside them in these difficult moments over the last number of days.
[1160.22 → 1163.22] Those moments of sorrow and grief.
[1163.22 → 1170.22] And by being here today, your presence continues to be a significant amount of support to them all.
[1170.22 → 1178.22] I would also like to welcome all those who are not able to join us in person, but are joining us via livestream.
[1178.22 → 1185.22] Again, your presence is felt and much appreciated.
[1185.22 → 1187.22] My name is Joe Chalk.
[1187.22 → 1197.22] I'm a friend of Hank and Jean, and a fellow member of this church, Ladder CRC.
[1197.22 → 1207.22] Over the past six years or so, I have been a regular visitor and support person for Hank, and before that time, even before his time in care.
[1207.22 → 1217.22] I feel privileged and honoured to have been asked by the family to help lead in this service.
[1217.22 → 1235.22] A heartfelt thank you from the family goes out to Pastor Jason True, who will officiate this service, and to Marian Mandrel and Mel Mass, who will help lead us from the piano and the organ in our singing.
[1235.22 → 1242.22] And many thanks to Don Mandrel and Laurie Wetterhorn, who are doing the sound and screen work today.
[1242.22 → 1245.22] In this service, a number of things will happen.
[1245.22 → 1252.22] This slide show was a wonderful way to start the service and take us down that memory lane.
[1252.22 → 1258.22] We have come together today to remember.
[1258.22 → 1263.22] We've come together to grieve and mourn a loss.
[1263.22 → 1267.22] We have come together to comfort and console.
[1267.22 → 1276.22] We have come together to rejoice and give thanks for a life well lived that we felt privileged to share.
[1276.22 → 1287.22] And we have come together to remember that Hank's wish was to go home, to be with the Lord, and those wishes have been fulfilled now.
[1287.22 → 1293.22] And we do all of these things in the promised hope of our living Saviour, Jesus.
[1293.22 → 1297.22] Some of us will do these things in different ways.
[1297.22 → 1302.22] Yes, there will be some difficult thoughts and memories to work through.
[1302.22 → 1304.22] There may be some tears.
[1304.22 → 1307.22] There should be some smiles.
[1307.22 → 1311.22] Some that we have already seen when we are watching this slide show.
[1311.22 → 1322.22] And there will be wonderful memories created, left for all of us going forward in the days to come.
[1322.22 → 1330.22] To especially the young great-grandchildren, I want to say this memorial is for you too.
[1330.22 → 1338.22] It's about honouring and remembering your great as you knew and called your great-grandfather.
[1338.22 → 1341.22] You are very much a part of this service.
[1341.22 → 1345.22] And you need to feel that in a real way.
[1345.22 → 1363.22] Hendrik Adrian Hence-Nyman was born on the 28th of August 1937 in Alien, province of Gelderland in the Netherlands.
[1363.22 → 1370.22] The only child born to parents Antony and Johanna Lyman.
[1370.22 → 1376.22] Hence spent most of his childhood during World War two times.
[1376.22 → 1386.22] Shortly after the war, July 1948, Hence immigrated with his parents to Canada and settled in the Lower Mainland.
[1386.22 → 1394.22] Hence vividly remembered the first home he and his parents lived in at Crescent Beach.
[1394.22 → 1401.22] He recalled and told me some wonderful stories of his first couple of years here in Canada.
[1401.22 → 1411.22] Just a couple, and that happened just a couple of years ago when I drove him to Crescent Beach and to that home that still exists.
[1411.22 → 1417.22] Hank spent his teenage years in Burnaby in Vancouver.
[1417.22 → 1426.22] He trained, schooled as a draftsman and soon after his training was complete,
[1426.22 → 1435.22] he hired on as the draftsman for the Corporation of Delta, where he worked for some 39 years.
[1435.22 → 1448.22] Shortly after starting his new job, Hence and Jean were married and several years later, with young son Anthony,
[1448.22 → 1452.22] moved into a newly built home in Ladder.
[1452.22 → 1465.22] Hank, or Henry, as he was known by his colleagues at work, was a hardworking, conscientious and extremely loyal employee,
[1465.22 → 1470.22] who was valued by the Corporation's Engineering Department.
[1470.22 → 1482.22] There's even a story out there, and you saw a glimpse of it, that for a short time, Ferry Road was renamed Lyman's Freeway.
[1482.22 → 1489.22] At that time, Hank was a supervisor responsible for a subdivision development in that area.
[1489.22 → 1499.22] And when he, and he and his white corporation vehicle, were often constantly noted driving up and down Ferry Road.
[1499.22 → 1505.22] Sometimes, several times a day, overseeing the work in that area.
[1505.22 → 1516.22] The actual, authentic-looking street sign, as you saw, is still a memento that Hank was quietly proud of.
[1516.22 → 1522.22] Hank was happiest at home or with family.
[1522.22 → 1527.22] I knew him as a quiet, soft-spoken, and gentle man.
[1527.22 → 1536.22] He loved to read, and even on vacation, he was often most relaxed with a book in hand.
[1536.22 → 1551.22] He helped when volunteers were needed to build churches, this church, Christian schools, and he treasured his home and his yard.
[1551.22 → 1559.22] He completed his studies as well during a long period of time here.
[1559.22 → 1573.22] After his retirement in 1996, he and Jean travelled a lot, camping, flying to sunshine spots, taking a number of cruises,
[1573.22 → 1585.22] and obviously travelling back to Ontario to visit with their much-loved Anthony and his family, his children, his grandchildren.
[1585.22 → 1593.22] Just over five years ago now, it was determined that Hank needed full-time care.
[1593.22 → 1599.22] Hank was a very, very, very, very happy, and he took up residence in Delta View Habilitation Centre.
[1599.22 → 1603.22] Hank met many new friends.
[1603.22 → 1615.22] Both those persons who were fellow tenants and many of the caregivers who sustained and helped Hank during some trying times.
[1615.22 → 1626.22] I do not remember a time when I visited Hank, usually on a bi-weekly or so basis, where he didn't greet you with his ever-present smile.
[1626.22 → 1631.22] And we saw examples, many examples of that in the slideshow.
[1631.22 → 1635.22] That smile was known by all the staff.
[1635.22 → 1644.22] He often showed that smile and gave a friendly greeting when caregivers or other Delta View workers would come by.
[1644.22 → 1649.22] All of whom seemed to know and acknowledge Hank.
[1649.22 → 1654.22] We shared many stories together.
[1654.22 → 1670.22] Hank, up until COVID times changed and limited visitation, always knew what was happening in the world, in his church and with his church family,
[1670.22 → 1677.22] and obviously everything that was happening in the municipality.
[1677.22 → 1680.22] We shared many wonderful things.
[1680.22 → 1683.22] Many things about his joys in life.
[1683.22 → 1689.22] Gene, his son Anthony, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren.
[1689.22 → 1691.22] And we shared prayers.
[1691.22 → 1695.22] Something he always thanked me for and always followed up with,
[1695.22 → 1698.22] and be sure to say hi to Shirley.
[1698.22 → 1700.22] Shirley's my wife.
[1700.22 → 1705.22] Last couple of years became more difficult for Hank.
[1705.22 → 1711.22] His mobility became restricted, and he required complete care and help.
[1711.22 → 1720.22] Hank passed away very unexpectedly and suddenly late Tuesday evening a week ago.
[1720.22 → 1728.22] He no longer suffers from the ravishes of disease that he had battled so long.
[1728.22 → 1741.22] He is now in his eternal home with his Lord and Saviour Jesus, just as he longed for some time.
[1741.22 → 1750.22] At this moment of sorrow, the Lord is in our midst and assures us with his word from Matthew 5, verse 4,
[1750.22 → 1756.22] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[1756.22 → 1766.22] And we can all live in the comfort and the confidence of this beautiful picture that was given to us in Revelation 21, verses 1 to 5.
[1766.22 → 1775.22] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
[1775.22 → 1786.22] I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed for her husband.
[1786.22 → 1789.22] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[1789.22 → 1796.22] Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them.
[1796.22 → 1802.22] They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
[1802.22 → 1805.22] He will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[1805.22 → 1814.22] There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.
[1814.22 → 1817.22] He who was seated on the throne said,
[1817.22 → 1820.22] I am making everything new.
[1820.22 → 1824.22] These words are trustworthy and true.
[1824.22 → 1829.22] Please join me in prayer.
[1829.22 → 1833.22] Our Lord and our God,
[1833.22 → 1839.22] the death of our brother Hank Riemann reminds us of our frail human condition
[1839.22 → 1844.22] and the brevity of our lives here on earth.
[1844.22 → 1850.22] Yet for those who are in the embrace of your love in Jesus Christ our Lord,
[1850.22 → 1860.22] death is not the end, nor can it destroy the bonds that bind us to you and to each other.
[1860.22 → 1867.22] Help us to share that faith together, even through our tears and sadness.
[1867.22 → 1873.22] Bring the light of Christ's resurrection to shine on this time of grief and pain.
[1873.22 → 1876.22] Through Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1876.22 → 1878.22] Amen.
[1878.22 → 1887.22] I'd ask now all of us to rise, and we will sing Blessed Assurance.
[1887.22 → 1888.22] Please rise.
[1888.22 → 1891.22] Hillary ζ revered in U of this in upon the cross over the cross upon healing.
[1891.22 → 1894.22] Please rise.
[1894.22 → 1913.22] When you squat knee to the cross upon healing,
[1913.22 → 1917.22] God creates grace Andrei in the process of healing.
[1917.22 → 1919.22] Amen.
[1947.22 → 1949.22] Amen.
[1977.22 → 1979.22] Amen.
[2007.22 → 2009.22] Amen.
[2037.22 → 2039.22] Amen.
[2067.22 → 2069.22] Amen.
[2069.22 → 2071.22] Amen.
[2071.22 → 2073.22] Amen.
[2083.22 → 2088.22] We'd now like to have a little time of sharing some memories.
[2088.22 → 2095.22] And as a matter of introduction, we will first have Ernst de Vries.
[2095.22 → 2105.22] Ernst de Vries is a former associate pastor of this church, former chaplain, a fill-in, part-time chaplain at Delta View.
[2105.22 → 2107.22] And Ernst will come up.
[2107.22 → 2114.22] He will be joined, following Ernst, by granddaughter, Krista Gillard.
[2114.22 → 2117.22] And she will have a few words to say.
[2117.22 → 2120.22] And that will be followed by son Anthony.
[2120.22 → 2124.22] So they'll come up in order as we go forward.
[2125.22 → 2131.22] Good afternoon.
[2131.22 → 2135.22] Good to see so many well-known faces again.
[2135.22 → 2145.22] Jane, before I say anything, I have to bring the sincere greetings from Winnie.
[2145.22 → 2148.22] And we hope to see you again in the middle of May.
[2148.22 → 2149.22] And then she will come.
[2149.22 → 2155.22] This was kind of a quick decision for me to come because there are more funerals, etc.
[2155.22 → 2161.22] So, Joe already said a lot of things I was going to say.
[2161.22 → 2163.22] So I will be very short.
[2163.22 → 2167.22] Wednesday mornings was always chapel morning at Delta View.
[2167.22 → 2181.22] And when I would come there, just like Joe said, when he would see you, he was right away, the hand high up and a big smile while he was finishing his breakfast with his colleagues, fellow residents.
[2181.22 → 2189.22] And so, and then I would take him the long hallway to the chapel.
[2189.22 → 2190.22] We would walk together.
[2190.22 → 2199.22] And as time passed, that walk would go slower and slower and slower till finally, it became the wheelchair.
[2199.22 → 2200.22] We all know about that.
[2200.22 → 2209.22] I think, beside visiting you and visiting Joe and visiting others, I think the chapel service was one of the highlights of the week.
[2209.22 → 2215.22] He always had, I could see it because I was standing up front there, a big smile on his face.
[2215.22 → 2216.22] He sang the songs.
[2216.22 → 2218.22] And so it was a wonderful time together.
[2218.22 → 2226.22] And then going back again, that long road, way walking to where he stayed.
[2226.22 → 2230.22] And so all I want to say is, may his memories be blessed.
[2230.22 → 2231.22] For me, it was.
[2231.22 → 2232.22] Thank you.
[2232.22 → 2233.22] Thank you.
[2233.22 → 2246.22] Hi, I'm Krista.
[2246.22 → 2249.22] I'm Hank's granddaughter.
[2249.22 → 2255.22] My grandfather held many different roles in many different people's lives, but to me, he was my granddad.
[2255.22 → 2262.22] My grandparents have always lived in a different province than me, but somehow it felt like we got to see them all the time.
[2262.22 → 2267.22] You see, they made a huge effort to travel to Ontario multiple times a year.
[2267.22 → 2270.22] And then sometimes we got to visit BC.
[2270.22 → 2277.22] It was always really nice for them to come to Ontario, but when we got to come to BC it was incredibly exciting.
[2277.22 → 2281.22] Granddad had this big brown camper van that he would drive us around in.
[2281.22 → 2285.22] I got to sit sideways in it and for some reason that was a huge thrill.
[2285.22 → 2297.22] He would tell me stories about my dad in that van and the trips that they had taken, and I loved hearing about the life that they had before I ever existed.
[2297.22 → 2302.22] My granddad was very intelligent and knew so much about so many things.
[2302.22 → 2307.22] He loved to tell me interesting facts and was always willing to answer my questions.
[2307.22 → 2317.22] I remember noticing the little lights embedded in the road through the George Massey Tunnel because I had never seen that before, and he called them cat's eyes and told me all about them.
[2317.22 → 2321.22] He always had something to say about the various bridges around here too.
[2321.22 → 2329.22] I can't remember specific details, but what I do remember is the fascination I had that my granddad knew all this information.
[2329.22 → 2333.22] I also remember the passion that showed as he shared his knowledge.
[2333.22 → 2338.22] Granddad always had cinnamon gum when I came to visit.
[2338.22 → 2341.22] I have loved cinnamon for as long as I can remember.
[2341.22 → 2345.22] And I wonder if it's because he always let me have a piece of his spicy gum.
[2345.22 → 2347.22] My granddad also loved salt.
[2347.22 → 2349.22] He put salt on everything.
[2349.22 → 2356.22] I remember once watching him put salt on his salad, and I was very confused.
[2356.22 → 2360.22] However, I now understand it because I've inherited his love for salt.
[2360.22 → 2366.22] And as weird as that may be, I love that there are parts of me that are connected to him that way.
[2366.22 → 2370.22] Apparently taste and smell can be connected to vivid memories.
[2370.22 → 2380.22] I had heard that this was true, but I'd never really experienced it until fairly recently when I walked past someone who was wearing the same aftershave that my granddad always wore.
[2380.22 → 2389.22] Instantly I was transported back into my grandparent's bedroom, sitting on the bed watching my granddad shave his face in the tiny ensuite bathroom.
[2389.22 → 2394.22] He would finish shaving and wipe off the excess shaving cream and then put his aftershave on.
[2394.22 → 2397.22] I always wished we could live in BC.
[2397.22 → 2402.22] I loved my grandparent's house, the house that my dad spent the majority of his childhood.
[2402.22 → 2408.22] And where my granddad worked hard on the lawn and just around the house.
[2408.22 → 2411.22] He was very proud of that house, and it just always felt like home.
[2411.22 → 2419.22] I miss the days of sitting outside on the deck with raspberry ginger ale, spending time with my grandparents and reading beside them.
[2419.22 → 2431.22] I was looking through old pictures of my childhood this week and while I always knew my grand was really involved with me and my brothers while we were little, I didn't remember how involved my granddad was as well.
[2431.22 → 2436.22] There were many pictures with him, reading, dancing, playing and cuddling with us.
[2436.22 → 2441.22] I hate that I don't remember that stuff first hand, but I'm thankful for pictures with those memories.
[2441.22 → 2448.22] One time my grandparents took my brother Sean and me to the Skydove Hotel in Toronto where there was a circus and rides, etc.
[2448.22 → 2452.22] Apparently we got to ride on an elephant, but I don't remember that part.
[2452.22 → 2457.22] I do remember eating at the restaurant that overlooks the stadium and watching the elephants walking around.
[2457.22 → 2464.22] We stayed overnight for at least one night and for some strange reason my grandparents decided to each sleep separately with one kid.
[2464.22 → 2472.22] So Sean slept with granddad and I slept with grand and let's just say that my poor grandparents were exhausted the next day.
[2472.22 → 2479.22] If you've ever slept with a kid, you know how they kick and starfish and generally make sleeping look like an acrobatic routine.
[2479.22 → 2485.22] When I finally got my own room at eight years old, my room had a double bed.
[2485.22 → 2489.22] I was so excited for such a big bed in my very own room.
[2489.22 → 2494.22] My granddad told me that that bed had belonged to him and my gran when they were first married.
[2494.22 → 2497.22] There was actually a picture in the slideshow of them newly married.
[2497.22 → 2501.22] And then he told me that my dad was likely conceived in that bed.
[2504.22 → 2508.22] My granddad had a unique sense of humour, and it was an endearing part of him.
[2508.22 → 2513.22] As I approached my teenage years, I got more and more interested in playing sports.
[2513.22 → 2516.22] When I was in grade eight, I played on my first softball team.
[2516.22 → 2519.22] My granddad gave me my first real baseball glove.
[2519.22 → 2523.22] It was old, it was used, but it was worn and it had a great pocket.
[2523.22 → 2525.22] And you might think, aw, that's so sweet.
[2525.22 → 2526.22] Which it absolutely was.
[2526.22 → 2532.22] But I didn't want to use it at first, you see, because the baseball he gave me was bright green.
[2534.22 → 2538.22] Apparently, also, he found it somewhere, and it was like a hand-me-down, hand-me-down.
[2538.22 → 2540.22] Anyway, I was thankful for it.
[2540.22 → 2542.22] I wasn't cool or popular at that age.
[2542.22 → 2544.22] I just wanted to blend in, not stand out.
[2544.22 → 2549.22] Some people made fun of me for that glove, but the more people noticed it, the more I wanted to keep using it.
[2549.22 → 2552.22] Even at that young age, I realized that it was special.
[2552.22 → 2555.22] Not because it's green, but because someone really important gave it to me
[2555.22 → 2559.22] and spent time throwing a baseball around with me so I could practice throwing and catching.
[2559.22 → 2565.22] My dad was the same way with me, so clearly my granddad raised him well.
[2565.22 → 2570.22] My dad officially taught me to drive when I was 16, and he was very patient with me.
[2570.22 → 2575.22] He gave me many opportunities to practice, and I really enjoyed spending time with my dad during those driving lessons.
[2575.22 → 2579.22] Unofficially, granddad was the first one to teach me to drive.
[2579.22 → 2587.22] When I was 13 years old, my grandparents invited me to come to BC by myself from Ontario as a gift for my 8th grade graduation.
[2587.22 → 2596.22] They took me camping at Cultus Lake in their fifth wheel, bought me special treats, and then my dear grandparents decided I was ready to get behind the wheel of their car.
[2596.22 → 2604.22] They took me to a country road and let me drive on the actual road and there were actual cars.
[2604.22 → 2607.22] It was exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.
[2607.22 → 2615.22] I'm not actually sure what they were thinking and if my parents approved, though I'm guessing it was an ask for forgiveness instead of permission type of situation.
[2615.22 → 2622.22] But if memory serves me right, granddad was beside me in the passenger seat and patiently kept me focused and steady, just like my dad.
[2622.22 → 2628.22] My dad is a wonderful father, and I'm certain it's because of the example my granddad set.
[2628.22 → 2634.22] My granddad had less and less to say as he got older, but he was always observing and keeping tabs on everything around him.
[2634.22 → 2640.22] When he became a great-grandfather, he loved my kids the same way that he's loved me all my life.
[2640.22 → 2645.22] He was very protective of those that he loved, and he held my family very close in his heart.
[2645.22 → 2651.22] God was gracious enough to give me time with my granddad this past summer as well as my husband and kids.
[2651.22 → 2658.22] One of the things I remember most is how much my son James reminded my granddad of his son, my dad Anthony.
[2658.22 → 2670.22] You could tell he was filled with joy at the memory of his own son as a child, and it was incredibly precious to see the huge smile on his face as he watched my kids just occupy space in front of him.
[2670.22 → 2677.22] They were running around the pond at Delta View and showing him the art they had created for him with drawings and sidewalk chalk.
[2677.22 → 2681.22] He visibly lit up when my kids hugged him and spoke to him.
[2681.22 → 2691.22] We made some beautiful memories those days that my family was able to visit him and if I had known they would be the last time we'd see him, I would have held on longer and spent more time soaking him in.
[2691.22 → 2698.22] I still remember giving him a kiss on the cheek with the rough stubble that my grand was always trying to tame when she would visit him.
[2698.22 → 2706.22] My grandparents took such good care of each other over the years, and I'm proud to tell people that they were coming up on their 65th wedding anniversary in just a couple of months.
[2706.22 → 2713.22] I'm thankful for the faith that my granddad led his family with and that my dad led us with.
[2713.22 → 2718.22] Because of that faith, I know that my granddad is no longer experiencing sickness or sorrow.
[2718.22 → 2722.22] He's in the arms of Jesus and for that we praise God.
[2722.22 → 2727.22] Thank you to everyone who loved my granddad and spent time with him, especially while he lived at Delta View.
[2727.22 → 2731.22] I love you granddad. Thank you for everything you've done for our family.
[2731.22 → 2738.22] Thank you for taking care of grand and raising my dad.
[2738.22 → 2757.22] Well, so many great words already.
[2757.22 → 2767.22] I'm just going to throw out a few pictures and a few thoughts about my dad to kind of round it all off.
[2767.22 → 2780.22] Hello everyone. On behalf of our family, I'd like to thank all of you, family and friends, for coming or for joining us online and sharing this celebration of dad's life with us.
[2780.22 → 2790.22] The first thing I would like to say is that although this is a sad time for us, we are immensely comforted by the fact that dad knew the Lord Jesus his entire life.
[2790.22 → 2797.22] And there is no doubt that he has been accepted into God's presence and has commenced the eternal part of his life in glory.
[2797.22 → 2806.22] Dad was a quiet man, fairly reserved, and although he held strong opinions, he rarely got into arguments about them.
[2806.22 → 2817.22] He loved keeping track of local and world news, and I vividly remember him listening to a tinny transistor radio while he shaved every morning.
[2817.22 → 2823.22] There was almost always a radio playing in our kitchen, often during mealtimes, to mom's chagrin.
[2823.22 → 2828.22] And listening to the news in the car was a family staple.
[2828.22 → 2840.22] In later years, he watched CBC News on TV, and although he never really entered the internet age, I'm sure he would love the possibilities for news and information that we now have at our fingertips.
[2840.22 → 2842.22] Dad loved to work around the house.
[2842.22 → 2853.22] When mom and dad planned and commissioned the house to be built in 1965, very few other homes had been built in the new subdivision.
[2853.22 → 2864.22] One day, after long hours spent preparing the yard for grass, by rolling the ground, spreading soil, raking, and seeding, he went inside for dinner.
[2864.22 → 2873.22] Shortly afterward, he glanced out at his handiwork and was surprised to see a horse rolling on its back in the newly planted grass seeds.
[2873.22 → 2883.22] Mom can still see the look of complete shock on dad's face, since they had no idea where a horse came from in the subdivision.
[2883.22 → 2896.22] In addition to all the work he put in over the years on the yards, gardens, driveway, concrete, fencing, the porch, he also did a lot of work inside the house.
[2896.22 → 2902.22] He spent years working on different parts of the basement, without ever quite managing to completely finish it.
[2902.22 → 2907.22] Dad taught me how to live my life.
[2907.22 → 2916.22] He had many little politically incorrect sayings that I can't share here, which had underlying truth that I gradually absorbed.
[2916.22 → 2923.22] He helped me in school, notably in math, penmanship, and the correct way a project report should be done.
[2923.22 → 2927.22] He played baseball with me and taught me how to shoot a BB gun.
[2927.22 → 2929.22] He taught me how to drive.
[2929.22 → 2934.22] Even though neither of us were musicians, he taught me to enjoy music.
[2934.22 → 2939.22] He even taught me about the secret underground world of sewers and water lines.
[2939.22 → 2944.22] Knowledge which I actually used in one of my jobs later on.
[2944.22 → 2947.22] These are all things I am incredibly grateful for.
[2947.22 → 2952.22] For relaxation, dad mainly loved to read, especially novels.
[2952.22 → 2958.22] His idea of a camping vacation was to go somewhere, set up camp, and spend time reading.
[2958.22 → 2966.22] He also liked to go on road trips, and he enjoyed cruising and travelling overseas with mom occasionally, too.
[2966.22 → 2971.22] Dad consistently supported the church and the Christian school his entire life.
[2971.22 → 2978.22] When this building was built, he was on the roof swinging a hammer, and he acted as treasurer for the building project as well.
[2978.22 → 2981.22] He also served on the board of the Christian school.
[2981.22 → 2987.22] His dedication to living out his faith through servanthood shaped my way of looking at the world.
[2987.22 → 2995.22] Dad and mom worked hard to pass on their quiet, determined faith in Jesus Christ to me, a heritage that I am constantly grateful for.
[2995.22 → 3000.22] Dad loved to be a granddad, which you could see in the slides.
[3000.22 → 3007.22] Although mom and dad lived here in Ladder, and we lived in Ontario, they made the most of the visits that took place in both directions.
[3007.22 → 3013.22] He played with the kids and read to them, and generally just enjoyed spending time with them.
[3013.22 → 3019.22] Later, when his great-grandchildren came along, he just enjoyed watching them and being there with them.
[3019.22 → 3023.22] For the last few years, dad was a resident at Delta View.
[3023.22 → 3029.22] Although his illness made it difficult to speak and to move around, he was still quite alert for the most part.
[3029.22 → 3036.22] He enjoyed regular visits from mom, and he was very happy when I was able to visit from time to time.
[3036.22 → 3042.22] He eagerly looked forward to visits from his grandchildren and great-grandchildren when they were able to come.
[3042.22 → 3051.22] People from the church, like Ernst de Vries, John Windermere, who brought up Tidbits, Joe Chalk, who fed his sweet tooth with chocolate,
[3051.22 → 3057.22] are all representatives of this community whose regular visits helped to keep him connected.
[3057.22 → 3059.22] I thank you for that.
[3059.22 → 3066.22] I know I've rambled on a bit, but my idea was to give you a bit of a snapshot into the type of man Hank Lyman was and what he meant to me.
[3066.22 → 3072.22] I love you, dad, and I thank God that he has set you free and taken you home.
[3072.22 → 3073.22] Thanks.
[3073.22 → 3089.22] I'm glad Anthony mentioned chocolate.
[3089.22 → 3090.22] Thank you.
[3090.22 → 3091.22] Thank you very much.
[3091.22 → 3092.22] I grew to know about Hank.
[3092.22 → 3099.22] It was something I grew to know about Hank after probably a first year or so of visiting at Delta View.
[3099.22 → 3108.22] One of my lasting memories also is of the last time I was able to visit with Hank, a week to the day that he passed.
[3108.22 → 3114.42] And I asked him, would you like some chocolate, Hank?
[3114.42 → 3119.62] And his face lit up, and he nodded, yes.
[3120.62 → 3123.28] He wasn't speaking anymore or very little.
[3124.28 → 3129.62] And so I went to look for the chocolate that I knew Gene always left there for him.
[3129.62 → 3136.60] But I couldn't find it, not in any of the drawers or anything.
[3136.60 → 3141.40] I said, Hank, I don't know, but I think the chocolate's all gone.
[3141.40 → 3144.90] You must have eaten it all the last time Gene was here.
[3145.90 → 3148.40] And he looked perplexed.
[3148.40 → 3150.50] And I thought, I've got to keep looking.
[3151.50 → 3155.10] And there was a little heart-shaped box on the top.
[3155.10 → 3158.10] And I thought, well, that can't contain a chocolate bar.
[3158.10 → 3165.00] But I looked and sure enough, there was a piece of chocolate bar left in that box
[3165.00 → 3167.50] with two pieces of chocolate.
[3167.50 → 3173.70] And Hank, as only Hank could, enjoyed those two pieces of chocolate
[3173.70 → 3177.70] over the course of about ten minutes of sucking on that chocolate
[3177.70 → 3179.64] with a smile on his face.
[3182.30 → 3188.36] Thank you for sharing those memories, Anthony and Krista and Ernst.
[3188.36 → 3196.50] I'd like everyone now to join us as we stand together, if you're able.
[3197.20 → 3203.10] And we'll have two songs, How Great Thou Art and How Great is the Love of the Father.
[3203.10 → 3207.48] So please, let's sing together, standing, if possible.
[3207.48 → 3212.56] gentle
[3221.86 → 3226.30] six
[3226.30 → 3227.48] impeach
[3227.48 → 3236.38] Oh, my God, we're not in the lost and found here.
[3236.96 → 3243.68] I've seen her fall, the worst I ever can be.
[3244.28 → 3253.02] I see the stars, the air that may be the air.
[3253.02 → 3261.48] I love you, my God, we're not in the lost and found here.
[3262.34 → 3270.10] I see my soul, I see you, God, we need.
[3270.10 → 3278.60] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[3278.60 → 3287.06] I see my soul, I see you, God, we need.
[3287.06 → 3293.06] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[3293.06 → 3301.52] I see my soul, I see you, God, we need.
[3301.52 → 3309.98] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[3309.98 → 3318.44] I see you, God, we need.
[3318.44 → 3326.90] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[3326.90 → 3335.36] I see you, God, we need.
[3335.36 → 3341.36] I see you, God, we need.
[3341.36 → 3349.82] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[3349.82 → 3355.82] I see you, God, we need.
[3355.82 → 3364.28] I see you, God, we need.
[3364.28 → 3370.28] I see you, God, we need.
[3370.28 → 3378.74] I see you, God, we need.
[3378.74 → 3387.20] I see you, God, we need.
[3387.20 → 3393.20] I see you, God, we need.
[3393.20 → 3401.66] I see you, God, we need.
[3401.66 → 3407.66] I see you, God, we need.
[3407.66 → 3414.66] I see you, God, we need.
[3414.66 → 3436.20] I see you, God, we need.
[3436.20 → 3438.84] I see you, God, we need.
[3440.88 → 3444.64] I see you, God, we need.
[3444.66 → 3445.66] Amen.
[3474.66 → 3475.66] Amen.
[3504.66 → 3506.66] Amen.
[3534.66 → 3535.66] Amen.
[3564.66 → 3565.66] Amen.
[3565.66 → 3566.66] Amen.
[3566.66 → 3594.64] We are now going to be privileged to have a
[3594.64 → 3595.64] Bible Church.
[3595.64 → 3607.26] There should be some Scripture reading, Luca from Leanne Mackenzie as they read Psalm 121
[3607.26 → 3612.10] with us.
[3612.10 → 3621.76] Please come on up.
[3621.76 → 3638.34] I lift my eyes to the hills.
[3638.88 → 3640.92] Where does my help come from?
[3641.82 → 3646.00] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[3646.20 → 3648.80] He will not let your foot slip.
[3648.80 → 3652.56] He who watches over you will not slumber.
[3653.34 → 3660.58] Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[3665.96 → 3668.14] The Lord watches over you.
[3668.36 → 3670.86] The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[3671.46 → 3674.84] The sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night.
[3675.18 → 3677.74] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[3677.74 → 3679.34] He will watch over your life.
[3679.76 → 3683.74] The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
[3683.74 → 3692.16] Question.
[3692.16 → 3708.60] Question. What is your only comfort in life and death?
[3708.90 → 3716.42] Answer. I am not my own, but I belong with body and soul, both in life and death, to my faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[3716.42 → 3724.12] He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has set me free from all power of the devil.
[3725.46 → 3732.62] He also preserves me in such a way that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head.
[3733.28 → 3736.58] Indeed, all things must work together for my salvation.
[3736.58 → 3750.40] Therefore, by his Holy Spirit, he also assures me of eternal life and makes me heartily willing and ready from now on to live for him.
[3751.16 → 3757.02] Question. What do you need to know in order to live and die in the joy of this comfort?
[3757.02 → 3761.68] Answer. First, how great my sins and misery are.
[3762.40 → 3765.78] Second, I am delivered from all my sins and misery.
[3766.78 → 3771.54] Third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance.
[3771.54 → 3783.30] Third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance.
[3783.30 → 3789.84] We'd now like to have you join us as we sing,
[3790.34 → 3792.96] Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole.
[3794.24 → 3795.32] Let's sing that together.
[3795.32 → 3812.44] Now, let's have you here.
[3812.44 → 3813.96] 
[3825.32 → 3826.32] Amen.
[3855.32 → 3857.32] Amen.
[3885.32 → 3886.32] Amen.
[3915.32 → 3917.32] Amen.
[3945.32 → 3947.32] Amen.
[3975.32 → 3977.32] Amen.
[4005.32 → 4007.32] Amen.
[4035.32 → 4036.78] Good afternoon.
[4038.96 → 4043.78] Thank you, James, for reading the Lord's Day One of the Heidelberg Catechism.
[4043.92 → 4044.70] You did a great job.
[4044.92 → 4048.06] And to Leah and Mackenzie for also reading Psalm 121.
[4048.92 → 4050.76] And it is a beautiful psalm.
[4051.40 → 4059.40] And Gene chose it for our service today because this was the psalm, if I believe I remember correctly, that was read at your wedding.
[4060.26 → 4060.50] Yes.
[4060.50 → 4068.42] And so as we consider this psalm together, I'm just going to briefly share a few thoughts with you.
[4069.58 → 4074.96] So Joel Skulk took me along to visit Hank one time at Delta View.
[4075.54 → 4076.80] And this was a few months ago.
[4077.80 → 4081.10] And the day that we visited, Hank was fairly alert.
[4081.24 → 4083.28] It took him a few minutes to open his eyes.
[4083.76 → 4084.46] But he did.
[4084.56 → 4086.68] And we actually, we had a nice conversation.
[4086.68 → 4093.82] We asked Hank many questions about his childhood and his life in Ladder.
[4093.98 → 4097.42] And he shared many wonderful memories with us from his life.
[4098.60 → 4105.70] And so this week, as I was reading Psalm 121 and thinking about Hank and about his life, one of the things that really struck me
[4105.70 → 4115.46] is just how that God is not just up in heaven somewhere far away or remote from us.
[4116.26 → 4119.94] But rather, he is concerned about our lives.
[4120.78 → 4124.64] He is present with us each step of the way.
[4125.82 → 4128.94] And that's what Psalm 121 really is all about.
[4130.20 → 4133.96] Psalm 121 is sometimes called the pilgrim song.
[4133.96 → 4144.06] It was a psalm sung by the ancient Israelites, the people of God of old, as they made their annual journey up to the city of Jerusalem.
[4145.18 → 4151.46] So originally, Psalm 121 was sung by God's people as a pilgrimage song.
[4152.24 → 4157.14] But it is now included in our Bibles because it is still true.
[4157.68 → 4160.56] And it is still valuable for us today.
[4160.56 → 4165.94] You see, Psalm 121 is a parable for all life.
[4167.54 → 4172.84] Hank and all of us here today are on a journey.
[4174.02 → 4175.58] We're all on a pilgrimage.
[4177.16 → 4183.22] And this psalm teaches us that God, who is the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[4183.22 → 4186.82] is also our personal guardian,
[4187.38 → 4189.12] whose help and who's covering,
[4190.26 → 4192.14] who's keeping and guarding over us,
[4192.20 → 4194.56] cover our entire lives.
[4196.00 → 4199.56] So the psalm begins in verse 1 with a question.
[4200.20 → 4200.54] It says,
[4200.62 → 4202.00] I lift my eyes to the hills.
[4202.14 → 4204.58] Where does my help come from?
[4204.58 → 4207.88] When a pilgrim left home,
[4208.26 → 4211.90] there was always concerns for safety along the way.
[4212.86 → 4216.68] There was perilous terrain to cross,
[4217.46 → 4221.72] unexpected injuries to be careful of and avoid.
[4222.64 → 4224.84] There were wild beasts lurking in the mountains
[4224.84 → 4228.16] and bandits hiding around many bends in the road.
[4228.16 → 4232.32] And maybe you're asking the same question today.
[4233.06 → 4234.46] Where does my help come from?
[4235.54 → 4237.56] You know, when we lose someone we love,
[4237.94 → 4239.96] one of the questions we honestly ask is,
[4240.08 → 4242.02] how am I going to get through this?
[4243.32 → 4249.34] Where is my help in the midst of this present sadness and trial?
[4249.34 → 4253.92] And in the face of all the dangers and uncertainties
[4253.92 → 4256.04] on this journey of life that all of us face,
[4256.14 → 4257.30] the psalmist declares,
[4257.80 → 4260.74] my help comes from the Lord,
[4261.26 → 4263.46] the maker of heaven and earth.
[4264.90 → 4269.38] And it's telling us that we don't need to fear the dangers in the hills
[4269.38 → 4274.20] because we can look to the one who created those hills.
[4274.86 → 4277.50] We can look to the God who created those hills
[4277.50 → 4278.74] and everything in them.
[4279.34 → 4283.76] And that is just as true today as it was back then.
[4285.02 → 4288.44] As pilgrims on our own journeys,
[4288.70 → 4292.42] we need to remember that our help comes from the Lord.
[4294.24 → 4297.42] Then verses 3 and 6 of the psalm go on to tell us
[4297.42 → 4301.68] that God is not only the source of our help for the journey,
[4302.08 → 4307.60] but also it tells us that our help is certain and sure,
[4307.60 → 4310.40] something we can rely on and trust in.
[4311.18 → 4312.02] One example,
[4312.02 → 4314.22] and we don't have time to go through the whole passage,
[4314.64 → 4316.88] but one example of this is found in the next verse,
[4316.94 → 4317.50] in verse 3.
[4318.64 → 4319.22] It says,
[4319.36 → 4321.60] He will not let your foot slip.
[4321.60 → 4323.24] You know,
[4323.24 → 4325.20] for the pilgrims on the journey to Jerusalem,
[4325.20 → 4328.86] the danger of falling off the path was very real.
[4329.36 → 4330.04] In that day,
[4330.12 → 4331.84] there were no roads like we know them now,
[4331.96 → 4334.02] no driving lessons to be had,
[4334.28 → 4337.86] but just that narrow path worn by passing travellers.
[4339.30 → 4340.78] And the psalmist uses this phrase,
[4340.78 → 4342.40] He will not let your foot slip.
[4343.44 → 4346.54] As a figure of speech to denote just any kind of trouble,
[4347.02 → 4350.70] any kind of misfortune that we meet along the way.
[4352.68 → 4353.82] Now, please listen.
[4354.32 → 4357.00] This does not at all mean that life will be a breeze
[4357.00 → 4360.10] and that everything will just go easily for us.
[4361.30 → 4365.22] Some people think that after they become a Christian,
[4365.36 → 4367.32] that life ought to go very smoothly.
[4367.32 → 4369.58] But God, friends,
[4369.70 → 4373.58] God never guarantees that difficulties will not occur.
[4374.56 → 4376.80] He does promise, though,
[4377.36 → 4379.74] that when we face trouble on the journey,
[4380.26 → 4382.64] that He is right there with us
[4382.64 → 4386.22] and that He is strong to help us
[4386.22 → 4387.62] and that when we stumble,
[4387.92 → 4389.10] He lifts us right up
[4389.10 → 4391.54] and He sets our feet on solid ground.
[4392.28 → 4394.06] His hand holds us
[4394.06 → 4397.26] through all the ups and downs and valleys and peaks.
[4397.32 → 4398.28] on the way.
[4399.74 → 4401.90] Now, our psalm ends by saying,
[4402.08 → 4404.18] the Lord will watch over your life.
[4405.02 → 4408.10] The Lord will watch over your coming and going,
[4408.22 → 4410.44] both now and forevermore.
[4411.54 → 4413.24] What a beautiful promise that is.
[4414.82 → 4417.72] It's a promise that could hardly be any stronger
[4417.72 → 4418.74] or more sweeping.
[4419.88 → 4423.80] The Lord will watch over your coming and going.
[4423.80 → 4426.10] That phrase, you're coming and going,
[4426.30 → 4428.66] has two meanings that are both important.
[4429.58 → 4431.18] First, it's a way of talking about
[4431.18 → 4433.38] just the everyday circumstances
[4433.38 → 4435.18] and occupations of life.
[4435.82 → 4438.94] Our trips out of the house and back home.
[4439.44 → 4440.82] Our coming and our going.
[4441.98 → 4442.76] But secondly,
[4443.22 → 4444.86] it also refers to
[4444.86 → 4447.28] the dawn and the sunset
[4447.28 → 4448.82] of our days.
[4449.18 → 4450.44] It's the whole span
[4450.44 → 4451.72] of our lives.
[4452.68 → 4455.14] The creator of the heavens and the earth,
[4455.22 → 4455.64] it says,
[4456.28 → 4458.38] will keep watch over you
[4458.38 → 4460.42] from your first breath
[4460.42 → 4462.54] till your final breath.
[4463.04 → 4464.40] And in every moment
[4464.40 → 4465.28] in between.
[4465.28 → 4469.50] I believe that God watched over Hank
[4469.50 → 4470.80] in this way.
[4471.94 → 4474.48] God watched over Hank's coming and going.
[4475.14 → 4477.42] All throughout his journey,
[4477.62 → 4478.28] many of these,
[4478.66 → 4480.36] the journey we got to hear
[4480.36 → 4481.98] as families shared these memories.
[4482.78 → 4484.62] From that first day Hank was born
[4484.62 → 4485.34] in the Netherlands
[4485.34 → 4487.06] through the trials and difficulties
[4487.06 → 4488.72] of the war years and growing up,
[4489.38 → 4491.06] to his immigrating to Canada,
[4491.46 → 4492.96] his starting a career
[4492.96 → 4494.20] as a civil engineer,
[4494.20 → 4495.54] getting married,
[4495.80 → 4496.66] having a child,
[4498.12 → 4498.96] devoting himself
[4498.96 → 4500.44] to his job,
[4500.54 → 4501.10] his church,
[4501.18 → 4501.88] his community.
[4502.80 → 4503.90] God was present
[4503.90 → 4506.60] in all of those moments.
[4507.36 → 4509.20] Watching over Hank's life.
[4510.02 → 4511.32] Watching over Joan's life.
[4511.46 → 4512.48] Bringing them together.
[4513.64 → 4515.06] God caring for
[4515.06 → 4517.66] and watching over Hank
[4517.66 → 4518.60] and Joan
[4518.60 → 4520.10] and all of his family.
[4521.50 → 4522.76] And Hank now is with
[4522.76 → 4523.96] the God who created him.
[4524.20 → 4525.70] The God who loved him
[4525.70 → 4526.92] and walked with him
[4526.92 → 4528.34] each step of his way
[4528.34 → 4529.86] in this life,
[4530.04 → 4530.54] finally
[4530.54 → 4532.80] bringing him home.
[4534.20 → 4534.94] And friends,
[4535.02 → 4535.80] we know that Hank
[4535.80 → 4537.58] is home with his Lord
[4537.58 → 4539.54] because of the promises
[4539.54 → 4540.08] of Jesus.
[4541.72 → 4543.16] In the Gospel of John,
[4543.28 → 4543.92] Jesus said,
[4543.92 → 4545.36] I am the resurrection
[4545.36 → 4546.12] and the life.
[4546.42 → 4547.90] The one who believes
[4547.90 → 4548.78] in me will live
[4548.78 → 4549.96] even though they die.
[4550.88 → 4551.98] And whoever lives
[4551.98 → 4553.44] by believing in me
[4553.44 → 4555.02] will never die.
[4556.72 → 4557.36] So,
[4557.56 → 4559.14] today as we gather
[4559.14 → 4561.16] and think about Hank
[4561.16 → 4562.56] and honour the person,
[4563.22 → 4564.86] who he was to us,
[4565.90 → 4567.80] this is where our firm
[4567.80 → 4568.94] and our certain hope
[4568.94 → 4569.86] comes from.
[4570.48 → 4571.46] That though things
[4571.46 → 4573.00] may shift in our lives
[4573.00 → 4574.46] on this journey
[4574.46 → 4575.80] that we are all on,
[4576.64 → 4578.08] and though along the journey
[4578.08 → 4579.22] we may lose those
[4579.22 → 4580.80] who are dear to us,
[4581.28 → 4583.04] we know that our anchor,
[4583.92 → 4585.30] the anchor of our lives,
[4585.46 → 4586.06] is in Jesus.
[4587.18 → 4588.04] And that both,
[4588.50 → 4589.96] as James reminded us of,
[4590.00 → 4591.54] in life and in death,
[4592.22 → 4592.86] that we belong
[4592.86 → 4594.34] to our faithful Saviour,
[4594.46 → 4595.08] Jesus Christ,
[4595.14 → 4595.84] and that nothing
[4595.84 → 4597.36] can separate us
[4597.36 → 4598.60] from his love.
[4600.58 → 4601.00] So,
[4601.06 → 4601.44] would you please
[4601.44 → 4602.14] join me in prayer?
[4605.74 → 4606.52] Heavenly Father,
[4606.62 → 4607.50] we are so grateful
[4607.50 → 4609.78] for your amazing promises
[4609.78 → 4610.58] that we find
[4610.58 → 4611.28] in your word,
[4611.38 → 4612.22] and especially, Lord,
[4612.30 → 4613.40] in Psalm 121,
[4613.84 → 4615.60] that you are the God
[4615.60 → 4616.28] of our journeys.
[4617.28 → 4618.80] You are the maker
[4618.80 → 4620.78] of this life,
[4621.36 → 4622.58] the heavens and the earth,
[4622.58 → 4623.70] that we journey through.
[4625.00 → 4626.32] And all along the way,
[4626.42 → 4626.54] Lord,
[4626.62 → 4627.34] you hold us,
[4628.02 → 4628.90] and you watch us,
[4628.98 → 4629.80] and you keep us,
[4630.08 → 4630.88] and you guard us.
[4632.96 → 4633.86] We thank you
[4633.86 → 4634.66] for your presence
[4634.66 → 4635.70] and your strength
[4635.70 → 4637.12] in each of our lives,
[4637.16 → 4638.44] and in the life of Hank.
[4639.82 → 4640.88] We thank you,
[4641.26 → 4642.02] God of grace,
[4642.74 → 4644.40] for sending your Son,
[4644.56 → 4645.58] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4645.58 → 4646.28] to bring life
[4646.28 → 4646.98] to this world.
[4647.52 → 4648.48] We give you thanks
[4648.48 → 4649.64] that by his death
[4649.64 → 4650.26] he destroyed
[4650.26 → 4651.42] the power of death,
[4651.42 → 4653.60] and by his resurrection
[4653.60 → 4654.44] he opened
[4654.44 → 4655.76] the kingdom of God
[4655.76 → 4656.84] to all those
[4656.84 → 4657.92] who believe
[4657.92 → 4658.78] in Christ.
[4660.30 → 4661.52] Make us confident
[4661.52 → 4662.76] that because he lives,
[4662.86 → 4663.94] we also shall live.
[4664.58 → 4665.48] Deepen our conviction
[4665.48 → 4666.36] that neither death
[4666.36 → 4667.06] nor life,
[4667.86 → 4668.72] nor things present
