[337.36 --> 365.56]  bundled at the
[365.56 --> 370.90]  frou-frou as a result of all this Advent stuff up here. Something didn't get re-plugged for the
[370.90 --> 375.26]  microphone, so we'll manage this way this morning. Welcome to you, and good to be here again this
[375.26 --> 379.90]  morning. For those of you who are joining by live stream, if you're visiting the church remotely or
[379.90 --> 385.82]  even person, I'm John Smith, and I will assist you with some aspects of this service. For this part
[385.82 --> 392.06]  of the service, I'm here instead of Pastor Jason, who's actually here, but he's not really here.
[392.06 --> 396.88]  He's been sick this week, along with the rest of his family. They've been ravaged by some sort of
[396.88 --> 402.34]  seasonal bug, but he will persist because he insisted on doing the first Sermon of Advent,
[402.52 --> 408.10]  so you'll see him later, but I'm here for the moment. We also welcome our church Chinese community
[408.10 --> 415.00]  for the first part of the service. Because of Pastor Nancy's surgery and recovery, which most of you
[415.00 --> 422.04]  know about, it prevents her from holding her service for some time, so for the first part of our service,
[422.06 --> 428.10]  we'll be hosting the Chinese community, and they'll be leaving for their visiting pastor
[428.10 --> 431.58]  at the time that the children leave for Sunday school.
[434.66 --> 439.86]  For those who are here, stay for coffee after the service. If you're new to this congregation,
[440.06 --> 446.62]  we'd like to have a chat with you, but if you signed up for the choir that is beginning to rehearse
[446.62 --> 454.70]  for Christmas Eve, get your coffee quickly, and then come back to the room here. There is time
[454.70 --> 459.84]  for you to quickly grab a cup, but we will start shortly after the service. It's really good to
[459.84 --> 466.22]  know that about 30 of you signed up to be in that choir, so it'll be something of a group to gather
[466.22 --> 470.82]  back together, but we'll see you there. For the rest of you, drink coffee for a while while we begin
[470.82 --> 483.52]  rehearsing. Last week was the end of the church year. Today is the start of the new year, the first
[483.52 --> 490.34]  Sunday of Advent. In the bulletin, there is a bookmark that I think was handed out with you this
[490.34 --> 496.18]  morning with suggested passages for each day during this entire period of Lent right up until December
[496.18 --> 504.60]  24. Feel free to use this as part of your daily devotions, and I thought I'd just point that out.
[509.22 --> 515.00]  Pastor Jason will start the Advent sermon series today on the mothers of Jesus. Today we're going
[515.00 --> 521.24]  to talk about Tamar, and he will be here because he really wanted to be sure he got the first Sunday
[521.24 --> 529.88]  of Advent started off right. Offering today is for the Cascade Christian Counseling. Rooted in God's
[529.88 --> 536.60]  word, this organization is ready to help deal with anxiety, depression, grief and loss, marital issues,
[536.60 --> 542.04]  and more. All of their therapists have appropriate education and experience and work from a Christian
[542.04 --> 548.12]  worldview. They serve the lower mainland from offices in Surrey and Abbotsford, and also provide
[548.12 --> 553.56]  counseling in Smithers, BC. So that will be our offering today taken later on in this service.
[554.84 --> 559.16]  For other announcements, another reminder, it's in the bulletin of course, that there's a seniors
[559.16 --> 565.40]  Christmas luncheon on December 7. If you haven't signed up yet, please do. Come at 1030, not for the
[565.40 --> 571.88]  lunch right away, but because you'll hear the Delta Christian School youngsters sing for us for a while.
[571.88 --> 574.60]  You wouldn't want to miss that. So that's December 7.
[574.60 --> 581.88]  On Thursday mornings, up until nearly Christmas time, we continue to have coffee time on Thursday
[581.88 --> 588.12]  morning at 10 a.m. We've had a significant turnout last week, and I hate to throw away coffee. I just
[588.12 --> 592.92]  don't think it's right. So be sure to come so we can drink all the coffee that we make on Thursday
[592.92 --> 598.12]  morning, anytime between 10 and 11 o'clock. Even if you only have a minute or two to say hello to folks,
[598.12 --> 606.84]  you'll discover that there's 12 to 15 people here. And finally, from the deacons, Elaine will come up and
[606.84 --> 609.16]  have a brief announcement about faith promise giving.
[609.16 --> 625.24]  Good morning. The deacons would like to remind you that the faith promise giving pledges will be
[625.24 --> 632.84]  collected next week in a special offering. They will be collected at the back doors after the service.
[632.84 --> 638.84]  of the deacons. And if you're not able to be here on December 4th, next week, we would like to have
[638.84 --> 647.08]  all forms either dropped off or mailed in by Friday, December 9. And thank you again for your contributions
[647.08 --> 651.08]  and support of Latin Christian Reform Church.
[663.80 --> 670.12]  Our call to worship this morning is based on Matthew 11 verses 28 to 30, and it'll be on the screen.
[670.12 --> 678.04]  The one difference is you get to start first. So follow along with the call to worship this morning.
[679.80 --> 688.04]  We have gathered in this place to worship because Jesus invites us to come. We come as you are,
[688.84 --> 697.08]  with our faith and our doubts, with our successes and our failures, because Jesus invites us to come.
[697.08 --> 706.04]  We come with what we have, bringing with us the events and experiences of this past week,
[706.76 --> 714.84]  because Jesus invites us to come. He said, Come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy
[714.84 --> 722.76]  burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in
[722.76 --> 731.32]  heart, and you will find rest for your souls. The Lord's greeting to you, more of a command, is adapted
[731.32 --> 741.72]  from Psalm 46. Be silent and know that I am God. I am your refuge and strength and ever-present help in
[741.72 --> 749.16]  trouble. I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world. The Lord Almighty is here
[749.16 --> 753.08]  among us. The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[757.16 --> 764.36]  Join me in a brief opening prayer of adoration, asking for God's presence with us, especially on this
[764.36 --> 768.36]  first Sunday of Advent.
[768.36 --> 777.16]  Come, long expected Lord Jesus. Excite in us a wonder at the wisdom and power of your Father and ours.
[778.04 --> 781.40]  Receive our prayer as part of our service of the Lord.
[781.40 --> 791.32]  Come, long expected Lord Jesus. Excite in us a hunger for peace, peace in the world, peace in our homes,
[791.88 --> 801.00]  peace in ourselves. Come, long expected Lord Jesus. Excite in us a joy to be responsive to the Father's
[801.00 --> 809.72]  wishes for us. We seek his will so we can serve with gladness, singing, and love. We pray in the name of
[809.72 --> 813.88]  Jesus Christ, whose advent we hail. Amen.
[815.64 --> 831.72]  If you are able, please stand and for mutual greetings and say hello to each other this morning.
[831.72 --> 835.88]  I'm having me hopefulness.
[836.76 --> 848.60]  Before we jump in, we try to Toussaint.
[850.04 --> 854.04]  Li about the Lord and the whole season weชaste, who is not safe for you,
[854.04 --> 860.12]  we must receive heat for the Father.
[860.12 --> 890.10]  Thank you.
[890.12 --> 920.10]  Thank you.
[920.12 --> 950.10]  Thank you.
[950.12 --> 980.10]  Thank you.
[980.12 --> 982.12]  Thank you.
[1010.12 --> 1012.12]  Thank you.
[1012.12 --> 1014.12]  Thank you.
[1042.12 --> 1044.12]  Thank you.
[1044.12 --> 1046.12]  Thank you.
[1046.12 --> 1048.12]  Thank you.
[1048.12 --> 1050.12]  Thank you.
[1050.12 --> 1052.12]  Thank you.
[1052.12 --> 1054.12]  Thank you.
[1062.12 --> 1063.12]  Thank you.
[1063.12 --> 1064.12]  Thank you.
[1064.12 --> 1066.12]  Thank you.
[1066.12 --> 1068.12]  Thank you.
[1068.12 --> 1070.12]  Thank you.
[1070.12 --> 1072.12]  Thank you.
[1072.12 --> 1074.12]  Thank you.
[1074.12 --> 1076.12]  Thank you.
[1076.12 --> 1079.12]  All right.
[1079.12 --> 1080.12]  Thank you.
[1080.12 --> 1110.10]  Let's sing along.
[1110.12 --> 1140.10]  Let's sing along.
[1140.12 --> 1170.10]  Let's sing along.
[1170.12 --> 1200.10]  Let's sing along.
[1200.10 --> 1202.10]  Let's sing along.
[1202.10 --> 1204.10]  Let's sing along.
[1204.10 --> 1206.10]  Let's sing along.
[1206.10 --> 1210.10]  Let's sing along.
[1210.10 --> 1212.10]  Let's sing along.
[1212.10 --> 1218.10]  Let's sing along.
[1218.10 --> 1224.10]  Let's sing along.
[1224.10 --> 1230.10]  Let's sing along.
[1230.10 --> 1236.10]  Let's sing along.
[1236.10 --> 1238.10]  Let's sing along.
[1238.10 --> 1244.10]  Let's sing along.
[1244.10 --> 1246.10]  Let's sing along.
[1246.10 --> 1260.10]  Oh, Lord, our souls in stillness pray.
[1260.10 --> 1266.10]  To thee our hope is in you.
[1266.10 --> 1274.10]  To thee our hope is in you, Lord.
[1274.10 --> 1282.10]  Please be seated.
[1304.10 --> 1316.10]  Today is the first Sunday of Advent, and on this day we light the first candle in our Advent wreath, the candle of hope.
[1316.10 --> 1328.10]  Our hope is in the Lord, maker of heaven and earth, and our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1328.10 --> 1336.10]  We put our hope in Jesus, the faithful Israelite who is restoring and reconciling all things.
[1336.10 --> 1342.10]  O house of Jacob, come.
[1342.10 --> 1354.10]  The light.
[1354.10 --> 1364.10]  Gracious Father, kindle in our hearts such a desire for you and your saving works that the flame may never be put out.
[1364.10 --> 1374.10]  Guide and direct us as we prepare our hearts to both celebrate the birth of your son and look forward to his second coming.
[1374.10 --> 1380.10]  We long for the day with hope-filled expectation when you will put the world to rights.
[1380.10 --> 1384.10]  And we thank you for giving us the hope of glory.
[1384.10 --> 1386.10]  Amen.
[1386.10 --> 1398.10]  O house of Jacob, come.
[1398.10 --> 1400.10]  Please stand for our next song.
[1400.10 --> 1416.10]  Jesus, welcome.
[1416.10 --> 1420.10]  Jesus, welcome.
[1420.10 --> 1430.10]  Jesus, welcome.
[1430.10 --> 1434.10]  Jesus, welcome.
[1436.10 --> 1446.10]  Jesus, welcome.
[1446.10 --> 1452.10]  You are the source of the heavens I have.
[1452.10 --> 1457.10]  In history, live and die,
[1457.10 --> 1462.10]  the hope that Jesus rose to life.
[1462.10 --> 1466.10]  You are the hope living in us.
[1466.10 --> 1471.10]  You are the love you can be just.
[1471.10 --> 1479.10]  You are the light shining for all the world to receive.
[1479.10 --> 1483.10]  The rose from the earth, the glory of the earth.
[1483.10 --> 1488.10]  All the words of Jesus Christ are still.
[1488.10 --> 1496.10]  Jesus is our hope living for all the will we see.
[1496.10 --> 1506.10]  All we believe.
[1506.10 --> 1510.10]  Jesus, our love of the nations.
[1510.10 --> 1516.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1516.10 --> 1524.10]  You are the source of the heavens and the heavens.
[1524.10 --> 1528.10]  Jesus, our love of the nations.
[1528.10 --> 1530.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1530.10 --> 1532.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1532.10 --> 1540.10]  You are the source of the heavens and the heavens.
[1540.10 --> 1542.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1542.10 --> 1544.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1544.10 --> 1546.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1546.10 --> 1548.10]  Jesus, our Lord.
[1548.10 --> 1552.10]  You are the hope living in us.
[1552.10 --> 1562.10]  You are the love you can be just.
[1562.10 --> 1565.10]  You are the light.
[1565.10 --> 1567.10]  You are the light in all the will we see.
[1567.10 --> 1573.10]  You are the love you can be just.
[1573.10 --> 1576.10]  Jesus our hope
[1576.10 --> 1580.10]  And for all who will receive
[1580.10 --> 1585.10]  Lord, we need you
[1585.10 --> 1589.10]  Lord, we need you
[1589.10 --> 1592.10]  Lord, we need you
[1603.10 --> 1617.10]  Lord, we need you
[1617.10 --> 1631.28]  Okay, so children ages 3 to 5, 3 to grade 5 are now dismissed for Kig's life, children's worship, and as well those joining us from the Chinese community, you are excused at this time for the remainder of your service this morning.
[1633.10 --> 1635.10]  Oops
[1651.10 --> 1654.10]  In our time of confession
[1654.10 --> 1661.10]  I've chosen something from an unnamed author on the website Ministry Matters
[1661.10 --> 1666.10]  Are we back to
[1666.10 --> 1670.10]  Okay
[1670.10 --> 1673.10]  Okay
[1673.10 --> 1677.10]  We found the switch
[1677.10 --> 1679.10]  Alright
[1679.10 --> 1686.10]  This confession reads like this
[1686.10 --> 1688.10]  God of mercy
[1688.10 --> 1691.10]  We come celebrating our unity
[1691.10 --> 1695.10]  But we confess the many ways that we are divided
[1695.10 --> 1703.10]  Our nationality, ethnic origin, economic status, gender, age, and musical preferences
[1703.10 --> 1708.10]  All too often these obscure the common calling we share in Christ's name
[1708.10 --> 1715.10]  May our common identity as your children and our communal witnesses to Christ bind us together in your name
[1715.10 --> 1719.10]  Forgive our tendency towards separation and division
[1719.10 --> 1722.10]  And remind us that we are your people
[1722.10 --> 1728.10]  Our assurance of forgiveness is from Philippians 2 verses 6 to 8
[1728.10 --> 1729.10]  Hear the good news
[1729.10 --> 1732.10]  Jesus, though he was in the form of God
[1732.10 --> 1736.10]  Did not count equality with God as something to be exploited
[1736.10 --> 1740.10]  But emptied himself, taking the form of a slave
[1740.10 --> 1744.10]  And became obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross
[1744.10 --> 1750.10]  Through his obedience we are therefore freed from whatever sin enslaves us
[1750.10 --> 1752.10]  Thanks be to God
[1752.10 --> 1756.10]  Shall we sing a song, Marvelous Grace?
[1756.10 --> 1762.10]  The final phrase of this song
[1762.10 --> 1765.10]  Grace that is greater than all our sin
[1765.10 --> 1771.10]  If we forget everything about today that we came and heard and enjoyed together
[1771.10 --> 1773.10]  If we remember that one phrase
[1773.10 --> 1775.10]  We've got everything we need for us to move
[1775.10 --> 1782.10]  To the Lord God
[1782.10 --> 1788.10]  God, all the grace of our God we call
[1788.10 --> 1794.10]  Grace that is seen our sin that will kill
[1794.10 --> 1800.10]  Honor, the power, the power, the power, the power
[1800.10 --> 1807.10]  Therefore the blood of our God we call
[1807.10 --> 1813.10]  Praise, praise, praise, praise
[1813.10 --> 1820.10]  Praise the good Lord, my friends may hear
[1820.10 --> 1826.10]  Praise, praise, praise, praise
[1826.10 --> 1829.10]  Praise, praise, praise
[1829.10 --> 1831.10]  Praise, praise, praise, praise
[1831.10 --> 1833.10]  Praise, praise, praise, praise, praise
[1833.10 --> 1848.92]  Praise, praise, praise.
[1849.10 --> 1853.10]  Praise, praise, praise
[1853.10 --> 1860.60]  The voice of the earth is the fighting cross.
[1862.22 --> 1868.10]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1868.94 --> 1874.88]  Praise that the Father has come to Him.
[1874.88 --> 1881.72]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1881.72 --> 1884.48]  Praise, praise, God's grace.
[1884.48 --> 1888.48]  Praise, God's grace.
[1890.48 --> 1896.72]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1896.72 --> 1903.72]  God can't have it to wash it away.
[1903.72 --> 1909.72]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1909.72 --> 1914.48]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1914.48 --> 1918.48]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1918.48 --> 1924.48]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1924.48 --> 1929.24]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1929.24 --> 1933.24]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1933.24 --> 1939.24]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1939.24 --> 1948.00]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1948.00 --> 1956.76]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1956.76 --> 1965.52]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1965.52 --> 1968.52]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1968.52 --> 1973.28]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1973.28 --> 1977.28]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1977.28 --> 1986.04]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1986.04 --> 1989.80]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1989.80 --> 1992.04]  God is the saint that He has come.
[1992.04 --> 2000.80]  God is the saint that He has come.
[2000.80 --> 2007.14]  that is greater than all our sin.
[2019.98 --> 2021.06]  Good morning.
[2022.42 --> 2026.48]  So before we read our scripture today,
[2026.48 --> 2035.16]  I would like to give an introduction to our new sermon series for the season of Advent.
[2035.48 --> 2038.52]  And it's a series that is called The Mothers of Jesus.
[2039.26 --> 2040.22]  The Mothers of Jesus.
[2041.06 --> 2044.60]  So I'll ask you a question. I'm sure you know the answer.
[2045.12 --> 2048.04]  How do most stories begin?
[2050.98 --> 2052.02]  In the beginning.
[2052.02 --> 2057.10]  Or on a dark and stormy night.
[2057.48 --> 2058.04]  Is that what you said?
[2059.18 --> 2060.96]  The galaxy far, far away.
[2062.38 --> 2064.92]  But normally it's once upon a time, right?
[2065.36 --> 2066.14]  Once upon a time.
[2066.98 --> 2072.16]  And that's the way fairy tales, fables, myths, legends begin.
[2072.34 --> 2075.02]  And when you begin a story once upon a time,
[2075.52 --> 2079.66]  you're saying that this probably didn't really happen.
[2079.66 --> 2083.28]  Or you're saying, well, we don't know if it happened.
[2083.86 --> 2087.76]  But it's a beautiful story that has a lovely lesson.
[2089.52 --> 2093.34]  But how does Matthew begin his gospel?
[2094.56 --> 2098.30]  He does not begin his story of Jesus' birth by saying,
[2099.08 --> 2100.48]  once upon a time.
[2100.86 --> 2101.76]  What does he say?
[2102.30 --> 2103.00]  We have it here.
[2103.00 --> 2108.78]  This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah.
[2109.66 --> 2113.34]  And that means, of course, that this is not a fairy tale.
[2114.56 --> 2119.54]  Matthew is grounding who Jesus is, what he came to do,
[2120.22 --> 2123.72]  in ancient history with a genealogy.
[2123.72 --> 2127.60]  Now, when we read Matthew, if you're like me,
[2127.68 --> 2130.30]  sometimes you open it up, this is the genealogy,
[2130.42 --> 2132.16]  and you see this list of names, and you're just like, okay, okay.
[2132.52 --> 2133.82]  You know, and then get to the good stuff.
[2135.88 --> 2140.92]  But genealogies in the ancient world were really important.
[2141.74 --> 2145.42]  And it was very much kind of like the way we think of a resume.
[2145.42 --> 2152.18]  In those times, it was your family tree, your clan, your pedigree,
[2153.04 --> 2156.62]  the people you're connected to that were important,
[2156.78 --> 2160.50]  that told you who you were in the world.
[2161.60 --> 2163.88]  So genealogy was a way of saying to the world,
[2164.30 --> 2165.28]  this is who I am.
[2165.62 --> 2168.34]  See, here's my genealogy.
[2169.54 --> 2173.14]  And just like today, you know, today if you write a resume,
[2173.58 --> 2174.38]  well, what do you do?
[2174.38 --> 2176.60]  You don't put in all the bad stuff.
[2177.40 --> 2181.22]  You put in all the good stuff, and you leave the bad stuff out.
[2182.30 --> 2185.08]  And in the ancient world, it's the same way with genealogies.
[2185.16 --> 2185.84]  They would be edited.
[2186.26 --> 2191.10]  You know, King Herod the Great struck a lot of names from his genealogy
[2191.10 --> 2193.16]  because he doesn't want to be connected with those people.
[2195.46 --> 2199.70]  And so because the purpose of the genealogy was to impress people
[2199.70 --> 2204.08]  with your respectable, your impressive ancestors,
[2204.38 --> 2210.70]  and that's what makes Jesus' genealogy in Matthew so shocking.
[2211.80 --> 2215.00]  What's surprising about Matthew's genealogy
[2215.00 --> 2218.28]  is that it includes the names of five women,
[2219.66 --> 2222.94]  four of Jesus' great-great-great-great-grandmothers,
[2223.30 --> 2225.32]  and Mary, his mother.
[2225.32 --> 2228.74]  And it's so surprising because in ancient genealogies,
[2228.82 --> 2230.66]  usually it's just the men who are included.
[2231.78 --> 2236.02]  But Matthew includes five women, gender outsiders.
[2237.28 --> 2241.54]  And then what's even more surprising is that these women in particular
[2241.54 --> 2245.92]  are not exactly the respectable matriarchs of the faith.
[2246.02 --> 2248.82]  That's not Sarah and Rebecca who are listed.
[2248.82 --> 2254.14]  But each of these women who are here, for one reason or another,
[2254.80 --> 2260.02]  are outsiders morally, racially, culturally marginalized.
[2260.98 --> 2269.98]  And yet, they are publicly acknowledged as the ancestors of Jesus the Messiah.
[2269.98 --> 2275.96]  And what that tells us is that God delights to take the most broken people,
[2276.34 --> 2278.88]  people who just are in their own stories,
[2278.96 --> 2281.74]  are up to their necks in the muck and the mire of the world,
[2281.98 --> 2285.48]  and he delights to make them his family.
[2287.88 --> 2293.54]  These are the women whom God chose to be the mothers of Jesus.
[2293.54 --> 2297.84]  And so for this Advent season, we're going to take each Sunday,
[2298.00 --> 2299.74]  and we're going to look at one of these women
[2299.74 --> 2304.60]  and lead up to Mary in the birth of Jesus.
[2305.70 --> 2310.18]  And so the first mother that's mentioned in Matthew's genealogy is Tamar,
[2310.62 --> 2313.62]  and her story is found in Genesis 38.
[2314.34 --> 2318.48]  So with that, I'm going to invite Jim to come and read Matthew.
[2318.64 --> 2321.64]  We're going to read the genealogy part of it each week,
[2321.64 --> 2323.80]  and then we're going to jump to the Old Testament story
[2323.80 --> 2325.72]  of that particular mother of Jesus.
[2330.88 --> 2332.68]  I'm James, the son of Joyce.
[2336.78 --> 2338.14]  How to put that in there? Thanks.
[2338.38 --> 2339.18]  Thanks for the introduction.
[2340.70 --> 2341.06]  Okay.
[2341.62 --> 2344.18]  I'm going to read two portions, first from Matthew 1,
[2344.58 --> 2347.34]  and then move to Genesis 38.
[2348.42 --> 2351.26]  This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah.
[2351.64 --> 2353.96]  Son of David, the son of Abraham.
[2354.96 --> 2356.70]  Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[2357.38 --> 2358.90]  Isaac was the father of Jacob.
[2359.62 --> 2362.04]  Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
[2363.04 --> 2365.78]  Judah, the father of Perez and Zebra,
[2366.30 --> 2367.54]  whose mother was Tamar.
[2368.32 --> 2370.56]  Now moving over to Genesis 38.
[2370.56 --> 2378.94]  At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullahem called Hira.
[2379.98 --> 2383.82]  There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man called Shua.
[2384.82 --> 2391.74]  He married her, made love to her, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son whose name was Er.
[2391.74 --> 2396.84]  She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Onan.
[2397.60 --> 2401.14]  She gave birth still to another son, and his name is Shelrah.
[2402.16 --> 2406.60]  And it was in Kazib that she gave birth to him.
[2406.60 --> 2411.30]  Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn.
[2412.06 --> 2413.54]  Her name was Tamar.
[2414.48 --> 2421.60]  But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the eyes of the Lord's sight, so the Lord put him to death.
[2421.60 --> 2425.88]  Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar,
[2426.56 --> 2431.66]  Live as a widow in your father's household until my son Shelrah grows up.
[2432.18 --> 2435.22]  For he thought he may die too, just like his brothers.
[2435.80 --> 2438.60]  So Tamar went to live in her father's household.
[2439.82 --> 2444.80]  After a long time, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died.
[2444.80 --> 2451.86]  When Judah recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah to the men who were shearing his sheep,
[2452.40 --> 2455.96]  and his friend Hira, the Adulamite, went with him.
[2456.98 --> 2457.86]  When Timur was told,
[2458.00 --> 2461.76]  Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,
[2462.10 --> 2464.12]  she took off her widow's clothes,
[2464.56 --> 2466.78]  covered herself with a veil to disguise herself,
[2467.24 --> 2469.90]  and then sat down at the entrance to Enahim,
[2470.32 --> 2472.00]  which is on the road to Timnah.
[2472.00 --> 2486.78]  When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute,
[2487.14 --> 2489.04]  for she had covered her face.
[2489.84 --> 2493.40]  Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law,
[2494.08 --> 2496.28]  he went over to her by the roadside and said,
[2496.56 --> 2499.08]  Come now, let me sleep with you.
[2499.08 --> 2502.98]  And what will you give me to sleep with you, she asked.
[2503.48 --> 2506.18]  I will send you a young goat from my flock, she said.
[2506.38 --> 2506.78]  He said.
[2507.58 --> 2511.00]  Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it, she asked.
[2511.54 --> 2514.46]  He said, What pledge shall I give you?
[2516.08 --> 2520.06]  Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand, she answered.
[2520.06 --> 2525.80]  So he gave them to her, and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
[2526.92 --> 2532.18]  After she left, she took off her veil, and put on her widow's clothes again.
[2533.54 --> 2537.66]  Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend, the Dulamite,
[2537.96 --> 2540.16]  in order to get his pledge back from the woman.
[2540.76 --> 2541.88]  But he did not find her.
[2542.62 --> 2543.88]  He asked the men who lived there,
[2543.88 --> 2548.72]  Where is the shrine prostitute who sat beside the road to Elohim?
[2549.64 --> 2554.08]  There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here, they said.
[2554.98 --> 2558.06]  So he went back to Judah and said, I didn't find her.
[2558.58 --> 2562.50]  Besides, the men who lived there said there hasn't been a shrine prostitute here.
[2563.66 --> 2566.68]  Then Judah said, Let her keep what she has,
[2567.24 --> 2569.28]  or we will become a laughing stock.
[2569.28 --> 2573.56]  After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her.
[2575.20 --> 2577.24]  About three months later, Judah was told,
[2577.36 --> 2580.42]  Your daughter-in-law, Tamar, is guilty of prostitution,
[2580.84 --> 2583.12]  and as a result, she is now pregnant.
[2584.06 --> 2586.98]  Judah said, Bring her out, and have her burned to death.
[2588.10 --> 2589.62]  And as she was being brought out,
[2590.06 --> 2592.02]  she sent a message to her father-in-law,
[2592.44 --> 2594.70]  I am pregnant by the man who owns these.
[2594.90 --> 2596.00]  She said, and she added,
[2596.00 --> 2600.20]  Yes, see if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff they are.
[2601.48 --> 2602.86]  Judah recognized them and said,
[2603.40 --> 2604.74]  She is more righteous than I,
[2604.82 --> 2608.28]  since I did not give her my son Shelrah,
[2608.74 --> 2611.62]  and he did not sleep with her again.
[2612.70 --> 2615.50]  When the time came for her to give birth,
[2615.88 --> 2617.30]  there were twin boys in the womb.
[2618.02 --> 2619.20]  And as she was giving birth,
[2619.28 --> 2620.90]  one of them put out his hand.
[2621.38 --> 2623.32]  So the midwife took a scarlet thread
[2623.32 --> 2625.34]  and tied it on his wrist and said,
[2625.74 --> 2627.30]  This one came out first.
[2628.06 --> 2629.46]  But when he drew his hand back,
[2629.52 --> 2630.44]  his brother came out,
[2630.68 --> 2631.20]  and she said,
[2631.30 --> 2633.34]  So, this is how you have broken out.
[2633.92 --> 2636.22]  And she named him Zerah,
[2636.40 --> 2637.36]  and his brother,
[2637.74 --> 2639.48]  who had the scarlet thread on his wrist,
[2639.56 --> 2639.94]  came out,
[2640.06 --> 2640.66]  and she called him.
[2641.56 --> 2642.94]  He was called Zerah.
[2643.38 --> 2644.58]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2644.58 --> 2656.00]  Thank you very much, Jim.
[2656.26 --> 2658.12]  That was not an easy passage to read.
[2659.66 --> 2660.76]  So let's pray together.
[2661.42 --> 2663.70]  Lord, would you open our hearts now.
[2664.66 --> 2665.84]  Lord, would you open our minds
[2665.84 --> 2668.98]  by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[2668.98 --> 2673.70]  so that as your word is heard again,
[2674.14 --> 2676.26]  that we may hear it with joy
[2676.26 --> 2679.94]  what you have to say to us today.
[2680.66 --> 2682.14]  Lord, and we pray in the name of Jesus,
[2682.28 --> 2683.38]  who is our King and Messiah.
[2683.78 --> 2684.12]  Amen.
[2686.06 --> 2689.52]  Not exactly a portrait of the ideal Christian family.
[2691.24 --> 2692.36]  Now, one of the reasons
[2692.36 --> 2695.26]  I think the Bible is true
[2695.26 --> 2697.80]  is because it has stuff like this in it.
[2698.68 --> 2698.82]  Right?
[2699.04 --> 2701.64]  The people who wrote this,
[2701.68 --> 2704.08]  it would not have advantaged them
[2704.08 --> 2705.12]  in any way
[2705.12 --> 2709.56]  to make their ancestors look this bad.
[2710.78 --> 2712.92]  And yet, it's in there
[2712.92 --> 2714.78]  because it's true.
[2715.24 --> 2717.20]  And they believed God wanted it there.
[2718.42 --> 2719.88]  And when we look at the scriptures,
[2720.14 --> 2721.94]  we see stories like this.
[2721.94 --> 2725.40]  And so if you approach the Bible
[2725.40 --> 2727.50]  as, you know,
[2727.56 --> 2729.08]  kind of assuming that the Bible
[2729.08 --> 2730.34]  is a book of fables
[2730.34 --> 2731.90]  with a moral at the end,
[2731.98 --> 2733.72]  then you are really going to be confused
[2733.72 --> 2735.22]  by this story.
[2736.80 --> 2739.44]  The Bible is most often not
[2739.44 --> 2742.20]  a record of moral heroes.
[2742.86 --> 2746.24]  It is not often filled with beautiful stories
[2746.24 --> 2749.08]  and uplifting and inspiring examples
[2749.08 --> 2750.46]  for us to follow.
[2750.46 --> 2752.46]  No, the Bible
[2752.46 --> 2753.84]  is a story
[2753.84 --> 2755.16]  of redemption.
[2756.30 --> 2757.56]  It's a story about a God
[2757.56 --> 2758.36]  who chooses
[2758.36 --> 2760.14]  to love a
[2760.14 --> 2762.62]  shameful and sinful people.
[2763.18 --> 2765.38]  And he pursues them
[2765.38 --> 2767.14]  and he saves them
[2767.14 --> 2769.48]  as his very own.
[2771.22 --> 2774.46]  So today we're going to look at Tamar's story
[2774.46 --> 2776.00]  and we're going to see
[2776.00 --> 2777.88]  three things about her story.
[2777.88 --> 2780.74]  We're going to see Tamar's vulnerability.
[2781.74 --> 2784.32]  And then we're going to see Tamar's courage.
[2784.90 --> 2785.90]  And then we're going to see that
[2785.90 --> 2787.32]  through her courage,
[2787.60 --> 2790.50]  we're going to see God's radical redemption.
[2792.14 --> 2794.68]  And Tamar's story is going to remind us
[2794.68 --> 2797.22]  that God works redemption
[2797.22 --> 2798.54]  and restoration
[2798.54 --> 2800.82]  in the most surprising ways
[2800.82 --> 2804.14]  and through the most surprising people.
[2804.14 --> 2806.22]  So let's begin
[2806.22 --> 2809.06]  with Tamar's vulnerability.
[2809.98 --> 2811.36]  The story begins
[2811.36 --> 2812.52]  with Judah
[2812.52 --> 2813.84]  leaving
[2813.84 --> 2815.10]  his brothers
[2815.10 --> 2816.84]  in his father's land
[2816.84 --> 2818.40]  and going to live
[2818.40 --> 2819.14]  with some friends
[2819.14 --> 2819.64]  among
[2819.64 --> 2820.94]  the Canaanites.
[2821.60 --> 2823.82]  Now this is our first red flag
[2823.82 --> 2824.96]  because the Israelites
[2824.96 --> 2827.32]  are not supposed to hang out
[2827.32 --> 2829.22]  let alone marry
[2829.22 --> 2830.96]  the Canaanites.
[2830.96 --> 2832.86]  The Canaanites worshipped other gods.
[2832.96 --> 2834.02]  They did not know
[2834.02 --> 2834.84]  the God of Israel
[2834.84 --> 2836.26]  or follow his ways.
[2837.22 --> 2838.66]  So there Judah is
[2838.66 --> 2839.64]  and he marries
[2839.64 --> 2840.74]  a Canaanite woman
[2840.74 --> 2842.50]  the daughter of Shua.
[2843.26 --> 2843.90]  And together
[2843.90 --> 2845.36]  they have three sons
[2845.36 --> 2845.82]  Ur,
[2846.12 --> 2846.54]  Onan,
[2847.18 --> 2847.72]  and Shalah.
[2849.40 --> 2850.28]  Well over time
[2850.28 --> 2851.54]  the boys grow up
[2851.54 --> 2853.74]  and Judah finds
[2853.74 --> 2855.26]  a Canaanite woman
[2855.26 --> 2856.88]  to be the wife
[2856.88 --> 2858.58]  of his eldest son
[2858.58 --> 2859.32]  Ur.
[2859.32 --> 2861.02]  and her name
[2861.02 --> 2862.32]  was Tamar.
[2863.76 --> 2865.24]  And right off the bat
[2865.24 --> 2866.50]  the story tells us
[2866.50 --> 2867.14]  that Ur
[2867.14 --> 2868.52]  was so wicked
[2868.52 --> 2870.48]  in the Lord's sight
[2870.48 --> 2871.28]  that God
[2871.28 --> 2872.44]  put him
[2872.44 --> 2873.30]  to death.
[2874.20 --> 2874.88]  Doesn't say
[2874.88 --> 2875.62]  what he did
[2875.62 --> 2877.92]  but he was that bad
[2877.92 --> 2879.46]  God took him
[2879.46 --> 2881.50]  leaving Tamar
[2881.50 --> 2882.48]  a widow.
[2883.44 --> 2884.42]  Now to understand
[2884.42 --> 2885.20]  what's going on
[2885.20 --> 2886.08]  in this story
[2886.08 --> 2887.38]  we need to know
[2887.38 --> 2888.34]  a little bit about
[2888.34 --> 2889.76]  ancient Near Eastern
[2889.76 --> 2890.70]  society.
[2891.66 --> 2892.90]  First we need to know
[2892.90 --> 2893.60]  that it was
[2893.60 --> 2894.64]  an agricultural
[2894.64 --> 2895.68]  society.
[2896.36 --> 2897.80]  And in an agricultural
[2897.80 --> 2898.54]  society
[2898.54 --> 2900.46]  land equals what?
[2901.90 --> 2902.52]  Money.
[2903.32 --> 2904.24]  Kind of like Vancouver
[2904.24 --> 2904.64]  but
[2904.64 --> 2906.86]  even more so.
[2907.62 --> 2908.72]  Without land
[2908.72 --> 2911.00]  you couldn't grow crops.
[2911.66 --> 2912.76]  Without land
[2912.76 --> 2913.72]  you couldn't raise
[2913.72 --> 2914.46]  livestock
[2914.46 --> 2915.40]  without crops
[2915.40 --> 2915.96]  and livestock
[2915.96 --> 2916.70]  you couldn't
[2916.70 --> 2917.88]  eat.
[2919.00 --> 2919.86]  And you wouldn't
[2919.86 --> 2920.62]  also have anything
[2920.62 --> 2921.34]  to trade
[2921.34 --> 2922.52]  for maybe
[2922.52 --> 2923.46]  the other goods
[2923.46 --> 2924.18]  that you need.
[2925.62 --> 2926.20]  And second
[2926.20 --> 2927.58]  not only was it
[2927.58 --> 2928.28]  an agricultural
[2928.28 --> 2928.84]  society
[2928.84 --> 2929.36]  it was a
[2929.36 --> 2930.80]  patriarchal society.
[2931.34 --> 2932.00]  And that means
[2932.00 --> 2933.08]  women couldn't
[2933.08 --> 2933.90]  own land.
[2934.90 --> 2936.16]  So the only way
[2936.16 --> 2936.70]  that they could
[2936.70 --> 2937.84]  provide for themselves
[2937.84 --> 2938.36]  and eat
[2938.36 --> 2938.78]  and have
[2938.78 --> 2940.26]  protection to live
[2940.26 --> 2941.52]  was through
[2941.52 --> 2942.18]  their connection
[2942.18 --> 2942.82]  to a man.
[2943.02 --> 2943.54]  Either their
[2943.54 --> 2944.00]  father
[2944.00 --> 2945.38]  or their
[2945.38 --> 2945.78]  husband.
[2946.82 --> 2947.50]  And that is
[2947.50 --> 2948.00]  what made
[2948.00 --> 2949.08]  widows like
[2949.08 --> 2949.74]  Tamar
[2949.74 --> 2951.80]  so extremely
[2951.80 --> 2953.02]  vulnerable.
[2954.28 --> 2954.90]  Tamar had
[2954.90 --> 2955.46]  left the
[2955.46 --> 2956.20]  protection of
[2956.20 --> 2956.84]  her father's
[2956.84 --> 2957.20]  house
[2957.20 --> 2958.06]  when she got
[2958.06 --> 2958.50]  married.
[2958.92 --> 2959.54]  But then
[2959.54 --> 2960.30]  her husband
[2960.30 --> 2961.10]  dies
[2961.10 --> 2961.92]  and she
[2961.92 --> 2962.50]  lost the
[2962.50 --> 2963.18]  right to
[2963.18 --> 2964.10]  his land
[2964.10 --> 2965.10]  and his
[2965.10 --> 2965.58]  inheritance.
[2965.58 --> 2965.86]  inheritance.
[2967.34 --> 2967.60]  So now
[2967.60 --> 2968.30]  Tamar is
[2968.30 --> 2968.80]  probably
[2968.80 --> 2969.40]  only about
[2969.40 --> 2970.16]  19 years
[2970.16 --> 2970.58]  old at
[2970.58 --> 2971.02]  this point.
[2972.08 --> 2972.30]  She's
[2972.30 --> 2972.88]  already
[2972.88 --> 2973.60]  a widow.
[2974.82 --> 2975.18]  And it's
[2975.18 --> 2975.76]  a tribal
[2975.76 --> 2976.34]  society.
[2976.48 --> 2976.70]  It's not
[2976.70 --> 2977.18]  like she
[2977.18 --> 2978.32]  can be
[2978.32 --> 2978.94]  an independent
[2978.94 --> 2979.60]  woman and
[2979.60 --> 2980.32]  get a job
[2980.32 --> 2980.78]  of her
[2980.78 --> 2981.00]  own.
[2981.08 --> 2981.60]  That wasn't
[2981.60 --> 2982.26]  an option
[2982.26 --> 2982.74]  that was
[2982.74 --> 2983.40]  available to
[2983.40 --> 2983.78]  her at
[2983.78 --> 2984.30]  that time.
[2984.86 --> 2985.56]  Which means
[2985.56 --> 2986.20]  for her
[2986.20 --> 2987.28]  there are
[2987.28 --> 2987.94]  not many
[2987.94 --> 2988.84]  options to
[2988.84 --> 2989.52]  survive
[2989.52 --> 2990.46]  and put
[2990.46 --> 2990.98]  food on
[2990.98 --> 2991.46]  the table.
[2991.94 --> 2992.46]  One option
[2992.46 --> 2992.82]  might have
[2992.82 --> 2993.32]  been to sell
[2993.32 --> 2993.92]  herself into
[2993.92 --> 2994.32]  slavery.
[2994.32 --> 2996.80]  And that's
[2996.80 --> 2997.98]  why God
[2997.98 --> 2999.14]  provided a
[2999.14 --> 3000.68]  tradition that
[3000.68 --> 3001.26]  would show
[3001.26 --> 3001.80]  up in
[3001.80 --> 3002.40]  Deuteronomy
[3002.40 --> 3002.94]  later as
[3002.94 --> 3003.28]  part of
[3003.28 --> 3003.70]  the Mosaic
[3003.70 --> 3004.72]  Law that
[3004.72 --> 3005.58]  addresses this
[3005.58 --> 3006.48]  exact situation.
[3007.26 --> 3007.82]  It was the
[3007.82 --> 3008.74]  law of
[3008.74 --> 3009.26]  Leverite
[3009.26 --> 3009.78]  marriage.
[3011.08 --> 3011.40]  So what
[3011.40 --> 3012.02]  happens is
[3012.02 --> 3012.38]  when a
[3012.38 --> 3013.02]  woman becomes
[3013.02 --> 3014.28]  a widow it
[3014.28 --> 3014.60]  was the
[3014.60 --> 3015.62]  obligation of
[3015.62 --> 3016.68]  the father-in-law
[3016.68 --> 3017.72]  to have one
[3017.72 --> 3018.30]  of his other
[3018.30 --> 3019.86]  sons take
[3019.86 --> 3021.10]  her as a
[3021.10 --> 3021.44]  wife.
[3022.24 --> 3022.68]  And the
[3022.68 --> 3023.46]  obligation was
[3023.46 --> 3023.96]  not only to
[3023.96 --> 3024.36]  take care
[3024.36 --> 3024.88]  of her
[3024.88 --> 3025.96]  but also
[3025.96 --> 3026.44]  to take
[3026.44 --> 3026.74]  care of
[3026.74 --> 3027.04]  the dead
[3027.04 --> 3027.46]  brother
[3027.46 --> 3028.38]  because he
[3028.38 --> 3028.78]  needs
[3028.78 --> 3029.52]  descendants
[3029.52 --> 3030.20]  who could
[3030.20 --> 3030.74]  then inherit
[3030.74 --> 3031.30]  his property
[3031.30 --> 3031.76]  and carry
[3031.76 --> 3032.62]  on his
[3032.62 --> 3032.94]  name.
[3034.52 --> 3034.92]  And so
[3034.92 --> 3036.16]  when we
[3036.16 --> 3036.82]  read this
[3036.82 --> 3037.78]  with our
[3037.78 --> 3038.20]  modern
[3038.20 --> 3039.02]  sensibilities
[3039.02 --> 3039.96]  usually this
[3039.96 --> 3041.12]  seems kind
[3041.12 --> 3041.68]  of strange.
[3041.84 --> 3042.18]  This is
[3042.18 --> 3042.62]  kind of
[3042.62 --> 3043.18]  maybe even
[3043.18 --> 3043.44]  a little
[3043.44 --> 3044.20]  seedy to
[3044.20 --> 3044.52]  us.
[3045.04 --> 3045.50]  But this
[3045.50 --> 3046.18]  was actually
[3046.18 --> 3047.12]  designed
[3047.12 --> 3048.60]  to reconnect
[3048.60 --> 3049.58]  this widow
[3049.58 --> 3050.66]  with a piece
[3050.66 --> 3051.48]  of land
[3051.48 --> 3052.74]  which was
[3052.74 --> 3053.56]  her means
[3053.56 --> 3054.16]  of survival.
[3055.02 --> 3055.42]  So this
[3055.42 --> 3055.80]  is what's
[3055.80 --> 3056.44]  going on.
[3057.44 --> 3058.20]  But Onan
[3058.20 --> 3059.50]  the second
[3059.50 --> 3060.28]  son of
[3060.28 --> 3060.66]  Judah
[3060.66 --> 3062.04]  didn't
[3062.04 --> 3062.62]  fulfill
[3062.62 --> 3062.92]  his
[3062.92 --> 3063.46]  obligation.
[3064.36 --> 3065.00]  He marries
[3065.00 --> 3065.48]  Tamar
[3065.48 --> 3066.46]  but he
[3066.46 --> 3067.42]  refuses to
[3067.42 --> 3067.98]  have children
[3067.98 --> 3068.48]  with her.
[3069.12 --> 3069.48]  And this
[3069.48 --> 3069.92]  was seen
[3069.92 --> 3070.36]  as so
[3070.36 --> 3070.84]  wicked
[3070.84 --> 3071.96]  in the
[3071.96 --> 3072.26]  sight of
[3072.26 --> 3072.66]  God that
[3072.66 --> 3073.16]  God puts
[3073.16 --> 3073.72]  Onan to
[3073.72 --> 3074.14]  death as
[3074.14 --> 3075.00]  well for
[3075.00 --> 3075.42]  that very
[3075.42 --> 3075.82]  reason.
[3075.82 --> 3078.12]  So now
[3078.12 --> 3078.70]  we have
[3078.70 --> 3079.86]  Tamar
[3079.86 --> 3081.04]  who is
[3081.04 --> 3082.20]  twice a
[3082.20 --> 3082.42]  widow.
[3083.76 --> 3084.22]  And what
[3084.22 --> 3084.84]  Judah does
[3084.84 --> 3085.98]  next only
[3085.98 --> 3087.30]  compounds
[3087.30 --> 3088.46]  Tamar's
[3088.46 --> 3089.20]  vulnerability
[3089.20 --> 3090.90]  because there
[3090.90 --> 3091.34]  is one
[3091.34 --> 3092.14]  more son
[3092.14 --> 3093.12]  Shelah.
[3094.12 --> 3094.64]  But verse
[3094.64 --> 3095.68]  11 tells us
[3095.68 --> 3096.12]  what Judah
[3096.12 --> 3096.60]  does.
[3096.74 --> 3097.18]  This is what
[3097.18 --> 3097.62]  he says.
[3097.76 --> 3098.66]  Judah then
[3098.66 --> 3099.28]  said to his
[3099.28 --> 3099.78]  daughter-in-law
[3099.78 --> 3101.42]  Tamar live
[3101.42 --> 3102.02]  as a widow
[3102.02 --> 3102.46]  in your
[3102.46 --> 3103.32]  father's house
[3103.32 --> 3103.96]  until my
[3103.96 --> 3104.50]  son Shelah
[3104.50 --> 3105.08]  grows up.
[3105.08 --> 3106.04]  For he
[3106.04 --> 3107.24]  thought he
[3107.24 --> 3107.72]  may die
[3107.72 --> 3108.32]  too just
[3108.32 --> 3109.10]  like his
[3109.10 --> 3109.44]  brothers.
[3110.18 --> 3110.42]  And of
[3110.42 --> 3110.76]  course what
[3110.76 --> 3111.02]  he see
[3111.02 --> 3111.70]  thinking there?
[3112.44 --> 3113.08]  It's her
[3113.08 --> 3113.46]  fault.
[3114.14 --> 3114.66]  You know I'm
[3114.66 --> 3115.46]  sensing a
[3115.46 --> 3116.66]  theme here.
[3117.34 --> 3117.50]  Right?
[3117.88 --> 3118.30]  One brother
[3118.30 --> 3118.76]  marries her
[3118.76 --> 3119.28]  he dies.
[3119.40 --> 3119.78]  Second brother
[3119.78 --> 3120.10]  marries her
[3120.10 --> 3120.52]  he dies.
[3120.78 --> 3121.18]  He's like I'm
[3121.18 --> 3121.46]  not giving
[3121.46 --> 3121.78]  her my
[3121.78 --> 3122.44]  third son.
[3124.44 --> 3124.94]  Of course
[3124.94 --> 3125.70]  the reason
[3125.70 --> 3126.24]  the Bible
[3126.24 --> 3126.70]  gives is
[3126.70 --> 3126.98]  they were
[3126.98 --> 3127.60]  both wicked.
[3128.36 --> 3128.70]  He's not
[3128.70 --> 3129.10]  able to
[3129.10 --> 3129.50]  recognize
[3129.50 --> 3129.72]  them.
[3130.24 --> 3131.80]  So Tamar
[3131.80 --> 3132.82]  went to
[3132.82 --> 3133.48]  live in
[3133.48 --> 3134.82]  her father's
[3134.82 --> 3135.36]  household.
[3136.70 --> 3136.94]  Okay now
[3136.94 --> 3137.74]  Shelah is
[3137.74 --> 3138.18]  too young
[3138.18 --> 3138.48]  to be
[3138.48 --> 3138.86]  married.
[3139.40 --> 3139.78]  So instead
[3139.78 --> 3140.44]  of taking
[3140.44 --> 3141.70]  Tamar though
[3141.70 --> 3142.38]  to live
[3142.38 --> 3143.14]  with him
[3143.14 --> 3143.46]  Judah
[3143.46 --> 3143.98]  to live
[3143.98 --> 3144.22]  in his
[3144.22 --> 3144.40]  own
[3144.40 --> 3144.86]  household
[3144.86 --> 3145.50]  instead
[3145.50 --> 3146.04]  of taking
[3146.04 --> 3146.66]  care of
[3146.66 --> 3146.90]  his
[3146.90 --> 3147.68]  daughter-in-law
[3147.68 --> 3148.98]  until
[3148.98 --> 3149.66]  Shelah grows
[3149.66 --> 3150.18]  up a bit
[3150.18 --> 3150.50]  and then
[3150.50 --> 3151.42]  marrying her
[3151.42 --> 3152.44]  to his
[3152.44 --> 3152.74]  youngest
[3152.74 --> 3153.20]  son
[3153.20 --> 3154.60]  Judah
[3154.60 --> 3155.58]  sends
[3155.58 --> 3156.18]  Tamar
[3156.18 --> 3156.88]  back
[3156.88 --> 3157.88]  to her
[3157.88 --> 3158.38]  father's
[3158.38 --> 3158.72]  house
[3158.72 --> 3159.30]  which
[3159.30 --> 3159.66]  apparently
[3159.66 --> 3160.64]  was very
[3160.64 --> 3161.50]  far away.
[3161.50 --> 3162.58]  And it
[3162.58 --> 3163.28]  seems that
[3163.28 --> 3163.88]  Judah does
[3163.88 --> 3164.24]  not have
[3164.24 --> 3165.22]  any intention
[3165.22 --> 3166.60]  of ever
[3166.60 --> 3167.20]  marrying
[3167.20 --> 3167.76]  Tamar
[3167.76 --> 3169.28]  to his
[3169.28 --> 3169.88]  third son
[3169.88 --> 3170.30]  Shelah.
[3171.06 --> 3171.64]  So Judah
[3171.64 --> 3172.22]  says
[3172.22 --> 3174.12]  you go
[3174.12 --> 3174.46]  wait
[3174.46 --> 3175.46]  don't call
[3175.46 --> 3175.78]  me
[3175.78 --> 3176.58]  I'll call
[3176.58 --> 3176.92]  you.
[3178.80 --> 3179.52]  And
[3179.52 --> 3180.70]  just to
[3180.70 --> 3181.06]  get rid
[3181.06 --> 3181.34]  of her
[3181.34 --> 3182.30]  his intent
[3182.30 --> 3182.98]  was out
[3182.98 --> 3183.34]  of sight
[3183.34 --> 3183.80]  out of
[3183.80 --> 3184.06]  mind.
[3185.38 --> 3185.60]  And to
[3185.60 --> 3186.32]  any Jewish
[3186.32 --> 3186.80]  reader
[3186.80 --> 3188.08]  Judah's
[3188.08 --> 3188.68]  actions
[3188.68 --> 3189.12]  would have
[3189.12 --> 3189.96]  come across
[3189.96 --> 3190.44]  as
[3190.44 --> 3191.08]  exceptionally
[3191.08 --> 3191.70]  cruel
[3191.70 --> 3193.28]  and heartless
[3193.28 --> 3194.10]  to his
[3194.10 --> 3194.72]  daughter-in-law
[3194.72 --> 3195.24]  Tamar
[3195.24 --> 3196.76]  who would
[3196.76 --> 3197.30]  be because
[3197.30 --> 3197.64]  of his
[3197.64 --> 3198.16]  actions
[3198.16 --> 3199.70]  cast out
[3199.70 --> 3200.56]  of society
[3200.56 --> 3201.48]  left alone
[3201.48 --> 3201.92]  with no
[3201.92 --> 3202.40]  protection
[3202.40 --> 3203.60]  and victimized
[3203.60 --> 3203.96]  for the rest
[3203.96 --> 3204.48]  of her life.
[3205.90 --> 3206.22]  And he
[3206.22 --> 3206.62]  knew that.
[3207.96 --> 3208.94]  So Tamar's
[3208.94 --> 3209.54]  vulnerability
[3209.54 --> 3210.90]  in this
[3210.90 --> 3211.36]  story
[3211.36 --> 3212.42]  builds
[3212.42 --> 3213.38]  and builds
[3213.38 --> 3214.64]  because of
[3214.64 --> 3215.46]  the wickedness
[3215.46 --> 3216.58]  and injustice
[3216.58 --> 3217.14]  of Judah
[3217.14 --> 3217.72]  and his
[3217.72 --> 3218.18]  sons.
[3218.68 --> 3219.50]  Who were
[3219.50 --> 3220.20]  biblically
[3220.20 --> 3221.26]  required
[3221.26 --> 3222.82]  to protect
[3222.82 --> 3223.04]  her.
[3223.16 --> 3223.40]  And the
[3223.40 --> 3224.14]  Bible calls
[3224.14 --> 3224.50]  it a
[3224.50 --> 3224.88]  matter
[3224.88 --> 3225.58]  of
[3225.58 --> 3226.62]  justice
[3226.62 --> 3227.98]  because
[3227.98 --> 3228.74]  she is
[3228.74 --> 3228.92]  a
[3228.92 --> 3229.44]  protected
[3229.44 --> 3230.00]  class.
[3230.48 --> 3230.84]  She is
[3230.84 --> 3231.24]  a widow.
[3231.80 --> 3232.04]  And
[3232.04 --> 3232.52]  everybody
[3232.52 --> 3233.10]  in that
[3233.10 --> 3233.58]  society
[3233.58 --> 3234.66]  by God's
[3234.66 --> 3235.08]  will
[3235.08 --> 3236.30]  is
[3236.30 --> 3237.60]  obligated
[3237.60 --> 3238.22]  to make
[3238.22 --> 3238.68]  sure that
[3238.68 --> 3239.10]  widows
[3239.10 --> 3239.68]  are taken
[3239.68 --> 3240.22]  care of.
[3241.00 --> 3241.50]  So let me
[3241.50 --> 3241.80]  share a
[3241.80 --> 3242.26]  couple verses
[3242.26 --> 3242.78]  with you.
[3243.32 --> 3243.82]  Isaiah
[3243.82 --> 3244.62]  chapter 1
[3244.62 --> 3245.32]  verse 17
[3245.32 --> 3246.42]  God says
[3246.42 --> 3246.72]  this
[3246.72 --> 3247.68]  learn to do
[3247.68 --> 3248.14]  right
[3248.14 --> 3249.24]  seek justice
[3249.24 --> 3250.28]  defend the
[3250.28 --> 3250.92]  oppressed
[3250.92 --> 3251.46]  take up
[3251.46 --> 3252.00]  the cause
[3252.00 --> 3252.24]  of the
[3252.24 --> 3252.86]  fatherless
[3252.86 --> 3253.80]  plead the
[3253.80 --> 3254.30]  case
[3254.30 --> 3255.26]  of the
[3255.26 --> 3255.56]  widow.
[3256.90 --> 3257.30]  And in
[3257.30 --> 3257.88]  Deuteronomy
[3257.88 --> 3258.58]  27
[3258.58 --> 3259.42]  verse 19
[3259.42 --> 3260.42]  cursed
[3260.42 --> 3261.26]  is anyone
[3261.26 --> 3261.86]  who
[3261.86 --> 3262.60]  withholds
[3262.60 --> 3263.24]  justice
[3263.24 --> 3264.12]  from the
[3264.12 --> 3265.42]  foreigner
[3265.42 --> 3266.28]  the
[3266.28 --> 3267.02]  fatherless
[3267.02 --> 3268.20]  or the
[3268.20 --> 3268.52]  widow.
[3268.52 --> 3269.02]  These
[3269.02 --> 3269.52]  are the
[3269.52 --> 3269.90]  biblical
[3269.90 --> 3270.88]  categories
[3270.88 --> 3271.86]  of
[3271.86 --> 3273.42]  people
[3273.42 --> 3274.42]  classes of
[3274.42 --> 3274.62]  people
[3274.62 --> 3274.82]  who
[3274.82 --> 3275.28]  needed
[3275.28 --> 3276.12]  protection.
[3277.24 --> 3277.82]  God
[3277.82 --> 3278.10]  even
[3278.10 --> 3278.72]  describes
[3278.72 --> 3279.50]  himself
[3279.50 --> 3280.20]  as
[3280.20 --> 3280.42]  the
[3280.42 --> 3280.92]  God
[3280.92 --> 3281.38]  of
[3281.38 --> 3282.04]  widows.
[3282.88 --> 3283.12]  So in
[3283.12 --> 3283.52]  Deuteronomy
[3283.52 --> 3284.00]  10
[3284.00 --> 3284.58]  17
[3284.58 --> 3285.02]  to 18
[3285.02 --> 3286.06]  he says
[3286.06 --> 3286.34]  for the
[3286.34 --> 3286.80]  Lord your
[3286.80 --> 3287.32]  God
[3287.32 --> 3287.96]  is
[3287.96 --> 3288.38]  God
[3288.38 --> 3288.54]  of
[3288.54 --> 3288.92]  gods
[3288.92 --> 3289.22]  Lord
[3289.22 --> 3289.44]  of
[3289.44 --> 3289.78]  lords
[3289.78 --> 3289.98]  the
[3289.98 --> 3290.34]  great
[3290.34 --> 3290.68]  God
[3290.68 --> 3290.98]  mighty
[3290.98 --> 3291.18]  and
[3291.18 --> 3291.48]  awesome
[3291.48 --> 3292.26]  how
[3292.26 --> 3293.08]  he
[3293.08 --> 3293.92]  defends
[3293.92 --> 3294.20]  the
[3294.20 --> 3294.88]  cause
[3294.88 --> 3295.28]  of the
[3295.28 --> 3296.02]  fatherless
[3296.02 --> 3297.16]  in the
[3297.16 --> 3297.42]  widow.
[3299.20 --> 3299.92]  It's
[3299.92 --> 3300.14]  about
[3300.14 --> 3300.78]  justice.
[3300.78 --> 3301.70]  The
[3301.70 --> 3301.94]  Bible
[3301.94 --> 3302.28]  doesn't
[3302.28 --> 3302.58]  call
[3302.58 --> 3302.90]  this
[3302.90 --> 3303.76]  charity
[3303.76 --> 3304.62]  for
[3304.62 --> 3305.16]  Tamar.
[3305.74 --> 3306.42]  She's
[3306.42 --> 3306.58]  not
[3306.58 --> 3306.96]  looking
[3306.96 --> 3307.22]  for
[3307.22 --> 3307.70]  charity.
[3308.30 --> 3308.62]  Charity
[3308.62 --> 3309.02]  implies
[3309.02 --> 3309.32]  that it's
[3309.32 --> 3309.72]  optional.
[3309.92 --> 3310.20]  She
[3310.20 --> 3310.82]  is
[3310.82 --> 3311.16]  seeking
[3311.16 --> 3312.60]  justice.
[3312.96 --> 3313.10]  That
[3313.10 --> 3313.42]  is the
[3313.42 --> 3313.86]  term
[3313.86 --> 3314.08]  the
[3314.08 --> 3314.36]  Bible
[3314.36 --> 3314.76]  used
[3314.76 --> 3315.24]  because
[3315.24 --> 3315.82]  it
[3315.82 --> 3316.16]  is
[3316.16 --> 3316.98]  owed
[3316.98 --> 3317.34]  to
[3317.34 --> 3317.62]  her.
[3318.76 --> 3318.90]  So
[3318.90 --> 3319.28]  Tamar
[3319.28 --> 3319.52]  is
[3319.52 --> 3319.66]  an
[3319.66 --> 3320.22]  extremely
[3320.22 --> 3321.04]  vulnerable
[3321.04 --> 3321.60]  position.
[3322.06 --> 3322.14]  She
[3322.14 --> 3322.26]  has
[3322.26 --> 3322.62]  absolutely
[3322.62 --> 3322.94]  no
[3322.94 --> 3323.34]  social
[3323.34 --> 3323.76]  standing,
[3323.92 --> 3324.06]  no
[3324.06 --> 3324.50]  protection
[3324.50 --> 3324.76]  at
[3324.76 --> 3325.04]  all,
[3325.16 --> 3325.86]  and
[3325.86 --> 3326.10]  she
[3326.10 --> 3326.66]  has
[3326.66 --> 3327.76]  nowhere
[3327.76 --> 3328.00]  to
[3328.00 --> 3328.24]  turn.
[3328.82 --> 3328.94]  She
[3328.94 --> 3329.10]  is
[3329.10 --> 3329.24]  out
[3329.24 --> 3329.34]  of
[3329.34 --> 3329.78]  options.
[3330.78 --> 3331.92]  So
[3331.92 --> 3332.38]  next
[3332.38 --> 3332.62]  we
[3332.62 --> 3332.86]  see
[3332.86 --> 3333.32]  Tamar's
[3333.32 --> 3333.76]  courage.
[3334.52 --> 3334.64]  And
[3334.64 --> 3334.84]  this
[3334.84 --> 3335.02]  is
[3335.02 --> 3335.28]  where
[3335.28 --> 3335.54]  our
[3335.54 --> 3335.86]  story
[3335.86 --> 3336.16]  takes
[3336.16 --> 3336.38]  a bit
[3336.38 --> 3336.62]  of a
[3336.62 --> 3336.98]  wild
[3336.98 --> 3337.20]  and
[3337.20 --> 3337.34]  a
[3337.34 --> 3337.56]  desperate
[3337.56 --> 3337.90]  turn.
[3339.48 --> 3340.04]  So
[3340.04 --> 3340.26]  what
[3340.26 --> 3340.78]  happens
[3340.78 --> 3341.68]  is
[3341.68 --> 3341.88]  that
[3341.88 --> 3342.34]  Judah's
[3342.34 --> 3342.64]  wife
[3342.64 --> 3343.10]  dies.
[3344.24 --> 3344.42]  And
[3344.42 --> 3344.68]  after
[3344.68 --> 3345.20]  a period
[3345.20 --> 3345.40]  of
[3345.40 --> 3345.82]  mourning,
[3346.82 --> 3347.16]  it's
[3347.16 --> 3347.82]  the time
[3347.82 --> 3348.24]  of
[3348.24 --> 3348.84]  harvest,
[3348.96 --> 3349.06]  it's
[3349.06 --> 3349.50]  the time
[3349.50 --> 3349.94]  of
[3349.94 --> 3350.60]  shearing
[3350.60 --> 3350.84]  the
[3350.84 --> 3351.16]  sheep.
[3351.48 --> 3351.64]  So
[3351.64 --> 3351.74]  it's
[3351.74 --> 3351.86]  kind
[3351.86 --> 3351.94]  of
[3351.94 --> 3352.04]  a
[3352.04 --> 3352.36]  joyous
[3352.36 --> 3352.82]  time,
[3353.00 --> 3353.38]  harvest
[3353.38 --> 3353.58]  is
[3353.58 --> 3353.82]  in,
[3353.88 --> 3353.98]  the
[3353.98 --> 3354.16]  sheep
[3354.16 --> 3354.28]  are
[3354.28 --> 3354.46]  being
[3354.46 --> 3354.88]  sheared.
[3355.78 --> 3355.98]  Judah
[3355.98 --> 3356.34]  goes
[3356.34 --> 3356.58]  up
[3356.58 --> 3356.96]  country
[3356.96 --> 3357.22]  to
[3357.22 --> 3357.50]  have
[3357.50 --> 3357.74]  his
[3357.74 --> 3358.16]  sheep
[3358.16 --> 3358.70]  sheared.
[3359.66 --> 3360.12]  So
[3360.12 --> 3360.42]  one
[3360.42 --> 3360.76]  day
[3360.76 --> 3361.24]  Tamar
[3361.24 --> 3361.60]  hears
[3361.60 --> 3361.82]  that
[3361.82 --> 3362.06]  Judah
[3362.06 --> 3362.34]  has
[3362.34 --> 3362.76]  gone
[3362.76 --> 3363.36]  to
[3363.36 --> 3363.54]  shear
[3363.54 --> 3363.78]  his
[3363.78 --> 3364.08]  sheep
[3364.08 --> 3364.26]  and
[3364.26 --> 3364.44]  that
[3364.44 --> 3364.78]  he
[3364.78 --> 3364.98]  was
[3364.98 --> 3365.10]  going
[3365.10 --> 3365.16]  to
[3365.16 --> 3365.32]  be
[3365.32 --> 3365.72]  passing
[3365.72 --> 3366.16]  through
[3366.16 --> 3366.44]  where
[3366.44 --> 3366.68]  she
[3366.68 --> 3367.14]  was.
[3367.76 --> 3368.26]  So
[3368.26 --> 3368.50]  she
[3368.50 --> 3368.86]  comes
[3368.86 --> 3369.14]  up
[3369.14 --> 3369.62]  with
[3369.62 --> 3370.60]  a
[3370.60 --> 3371.14]  dramatic
[3371.14 --> 3372.66]  and
[3372.66 --> 3373.36]  brilliant
[3373.36 --> 3373.98]  plan.
[3375.00 --> 3375.24]  She
[3375.24 --> 3375.94]  disguises
[3375.94 --> 3376.52]  herself
[3376.52 --> 3377.46]  as a
[3377.46 --> 3377.76]  cult
[3377.76 --> 3378.50]  prostitute
[3378.50 --> 3379.36]  and she
[3379.36 --> 3379.72]  waits
[3379.72 --> 3380.00]  on the
[3380.00 --> 3380.22]  side
[3380.22 --> 3380.30]  of
[3380.30 --> 3380.42]  the
[3380.42 --> 3380.62]  road
[3380.62 --> 3380.84]  for
[3380.84 --> 3381.24]  Judah
[3381.24 --> 3381.96]  to
[3381.96 --> 3382.30]  pass
[3382.30 --> 3382.62]  by.
[3383.52 --> 3383.64]  And
[3383.64 --> 3383.94]  sure
[3383.94 --> 3384.24]  enough,
[3384.36 --> 3384.52]  Judah
[3384.52 --> 3384.82]  comes
[3384.82 --> 3385.18]  by,
[3385.54 --> 3385.66]  he
[3385.66 --> 3386.04]  meets
[3386.04 --> 3386.22]  her
[3386.22 --> 3386.50]  on the
[3386.50 --> 3386.64]  side
[3386.64 --> 3386.84]  of the
[3386.84 --> 3387.08]  road
[3387.08 --> 3387.52]  and he
[3387.52 --> 3388.04]  asked
[3388.04 --> 3388.26]  to
[3388.26 --> 3388.44]  sleep
[3388.44 --> 3388.62]  with
[3388.62 --> 3388.80]  her.
[3389.76 --> 3390.16]  In
[3390.16 --> 3390.42]  that
[3390.42 --> 3390.72]  day,
[3390.84 --> 3391.06]  people
[3391.06 --> 3391.38]  didn't
[3391.38 --> 3391.70]  carry
[3391.70 --> 3392.10]  cash
[3392.10 --> 3392.46]  around.
[3393.30 --> 3393.52]  So
[3393.52 --> 3393.76]  Judah
[3393.76 --> 3394.04]  says,
[3394.16 --> 3394.26]  don't
[3394.26 --> 3394.46]  worry,
[3394.52 --> 3394.62]  I'll
[3394.62 --> 3394.88]  pay you
[3394.88 --> 3395.10]  when I
[3395.10 --> 3395.22]  get
[3395.22 --> 3395.52]  home.
[3396.14 --> 3396.30]  And
[3396.30 --> 3396.44]  I'm
[3396.44 --> 3396.56]  going to
[3396.56 --> 3396.72]  leave
[3396.72 --> 3396.92]  some
[3396.92 --> 3397.50]  collateral
[3397.50 --> 3398.38]  so you
[3398.38 --> 3398.52]  will
[3398.52 --> 3398.68]  make
[3398.68 --> 3398.88]  sure
[3398.88 --> 3399.26]  that
[3399.26 --> 3400.24]  I'm
[3400.24 --> 3400.44]  good
[3400.44 --> 3400.58]  on
[3400.58 --> 3400.74]  my
[3400.74 --> 3401.00]  word
[3401.00 --> 3401.26]  here.
[3402.44 --> 3402.92]  Now,
[3403.02 --> 3403.14]  of
[3403.14 --> 3403.40]  course,
[3403.52 --> 3403.90]  Tamar
[3403.90 --> 3404.52]  is not
[3404.52 --> 3405.12]  so
[3405.12 --> 3405.62]  concerned
[3405.62 --> 3405.92]  about
[3405.92 --> 3406.14]  being
[3406.14 --> 3406.62]  paid.
[3407.14 --> 3407.26]  What
[3407.26 --> 3407.48]  she
[3407.48 --> 3407.84]  is
[3407.84 --> 3408.28]  concerned
[3408.28 --> 3408.66]  about
[3408.66 --> 3409.14]  is
[3409.14 --> 3409.30]  that
[3409.30 --> 3409.50]  if
[3409.50 --> 3409.66]  she
[3409.66 --> 3409.92]  does
[3409.92 --> 3410.10]  get
[3410.10 --> 3410.48]  pregnant,
[3411.06 --> 3411.28]  she
[3411.28 --> 3411.54]  has
[3411.54 --> 3412.20]  proof
[3412.20 --> 3412.88]  of
[3412.88 --> 3413.00]  who
[3413.00 --> 3413.14]  the
[3413.14 --> 3413.40]  father
[3413.40 --> 3413.76]  is.
[3414.94 --> 3415.38]  So
[3415.38 --> 3415.60]  what
[3415.60 --> 3415.76]  does
[3415.76 --> 3415.90]  she
[3415.90 --> 3416.14]  ask
[3416.14 --> 3416.30]  for
[3416.30 --> 3416.78]  collateral?
[3417.78 --> 3418.06]  It's
[3418.06 --> 3418.38]  something
[3418.38 --> 3418.78]  that
[3418.78 --> 3419.08]  would
[3419.08 --> 3420.52]  undeniably
[3420.52 --> 3421.38]  identify
[3421.38 --> 3421.96]  this
[3421.96 --> 3422.42]  man
[3422.42 --> 3423.10]  as
[3423.10 --> 3423.46]  Judah.
[3424.26 --> 3424.60]  So
[3424.60 --> 3424.82]  she
[3424.82 --> 3425.14]  asked
[3425.14 --> 3425.26]  him
[3425.26 --> 3425.44]  for
[3425.44 --> 3425.68]  his
[3425.68 --> 3426.02]  seal,
[3426.46 --> 3426.70]  his
[3426.70 --> 3427.14]  cord,
[3427.46 --> 3427.62]  and
[3427.62 --> 3427.80]  his
[3427.80 --> 3428.22]  staff.
[3429.30 --> 3429.40]  And
[3429.40 --> 3429.64]  so
[3429.64 --> 3429.94]  the
[3429.94 --> 3430.30]  seal
[3430.30 --> 3430.52]  was
[3430.52 --> 3430.68]  kind
[3430.68 --> 3430.76]  of
[3430.76 --> 3430.94]  like
[3430.94 --> 3431.10]  our
[3431.10 --> 3431.38]  modern
[3431.38 --> 3431.54]  day
[3431.54 --> 3431.88]  equivalent
[3431.88 --> 3432.34]  of
[3432.34 --> 3432.74]  a
[3432.74 --> 3433.14]  driver's
[3433.14 --> 3433.60]  license.
[3434.32 --> 3434.56]  It
[3434.56 --> 3434.70]  would
[3434.70 --> 3435.16]  be
[3435.16 --> 3435.28]  a
[3435.28 --> 3435.42]  little
[3435.42 --> 3435.72]  clay
[3435.72 --> 3436.20]  cylinder
[3436.20 --> 3436.56]  that
[3436.56 --> 3436.70]  you
[3436.70 --> 3436.84]  would
[3436.84 --> 3437.02]  then
[3437.02 --> 3437.42]  roll
[3437.42 --> 3437.68]  on
[3437.68 --> 3438.10]  clay
[3438.10 --> 3438.48]  to
[3438.48 --> 3439.00]  make
[3439.00 --> 3439.12]  an
[3439.12 --> 3439.68]  imprint
[3439.68 --> 3440.52]  just
[3440.52 --> 3440.68]  kind
[3440.68 --> 3440.76]  of
[3440.76 --> 3440.92]  like
[3440.92 --> 3441.06]  your
[3441.06 --> 3441.42]  signature.
[3442.60 --> 3442.78]  And
[3442.78 --> 3442.96]  the
[3442.96 --> 3443.24]  seal
[3443.24 --> 3443.44]  would
[3443.44 --> 3443.58]  be
[3443.58 --> 3443.82]  worn
[3443.82 --> 3443.98]  on
[3443.98 --> 3444.12]  a
[3444.12 --> 3444.46]  cord
[3444.46 --> 3444.90]  around
[3444.90 --> 3445.54]  your
[3445.54 --> 3445.96]  neck.
[3446.68 --> 3446.94]  Put it
[3446.94 --> 3447.22]  around
[3447.22 --> 3447.58]  there.
[3447.72 --> 3447.76]  And
[3447.76 --> 3448.00]  so
[3448.00 --> 3448.18]  she
[3448.18 --> 3448.44]  asked
[3448.44 --> 3448.62]  for
[3448.62 --> 3448.80]  not
[3448.80 --> 3449.00]  just
[3449.00 --> 3449.18]  the
[3449.18 --> 3449.46]  seal
[3449.46 --> 3449.94]  but
[3449.94 --> 3450.10]  the
[3450.10 --> 3450.30]  whole
[3450.30 --> 3450.72]  cord.
[3450.88 --> 3450.96]  So
[3450.96 --> 3451.08]  you
[3451.08 --> 3451.32]  can't
[3451.32 --> 3451.48]  say
[3451.48 --> 3451.60]  it
[3451.60 --> 3451.82]  fell
[3451.82 --> 3452.14]  off.
[3452.26 --> 3452.38]  Right?
[3452.96 --> 3453.16]  Give
[3453.16 --> 3453.24]  me
[3453.24 --> 3453.36]  the
[3453.36 --> 3453.60]  cord,
[3453.72 --> 3453.84]  give
[3453.84 --> 3453.90]  me
[3453.90 --> 3454.04]  the
[3454.04 --> 3454.28]  seal,
[3454.40 --> 3454.50]  give
[3454.50 --> 3454.56]  me
[3454.56 --> 3454.70]  the
[3454.70 --> 3455.04]  staff.
[3456.44 --> 3456.64]  And
[3456.64 --> 3456.98]  notice
[3456.98 --> 3457.24]  that
[3457.24 --> 3457.78]  Tamar's
[3457.78 --> 3458.22]  entire
[3458.22 --> 3458.52]  desert
[3458.52 --> 3459.00]  plan
[3459.00 --> 3459.30]  is
[3459.30 --> 3459.76]  hinged
[3459.76 --> 3459.98]  on
[3459.98 --> 3460.12]  the
[3460.12 --> 3460.46]  fact
[3460.46 --> 3461.00]  that
[3461.00 --> 3461.22]  she
[3461.22 --> 3461.42]  is
[3461.42 --> 3462.02]  sure
[3462.02 --> 3462.66]  that
[3462.66 --> 3463.00]  Judah
[3463.00 --> 3463.24]  will
[3463.24 --> 3463.58]  what?
[3464.50 --> 3464.96]  Be
[3464.96 --> 3465.46]  tempted
[3465.46 --> 3466.24]  by
[3466.24 --> 3466.52]  a
[3466.52 --> 3466.76]  cold
[3466.76 --> 3467.40]  prostitute.
[3468.14 --> 3468.74]  And
[3468.74 --> 3468.96]  he
[3468.96 --> 3469.44]  is.
[3470.70 --> 3471.30]  What
[3471.30 --> 3471.46]  does
[3471.46 --> 3471.64]  this
[3471.64 --> 3471.86]  say
[3471.86 --> 3472.16]  about
[3472.16 --> 3472.54]  Judah's
[3472.54 --> 3472.90]  character?
[3474.12 --> 3474.26]  I
[3474.26 --> 3474.38]  mean
[3474.38 --> 3474.82]  obviously
[3474.82 --> 3475.18]  it
[3475.18 --> 3475.44]  means
[3475.44 --> 3475.64]  that
[3475.64 --> 3475.86]  he
[3475.86 --> 3476.18]  has
[3476.18 --> 3476.38]  a
[3476.38 --> 3476.76]  habit
[3476.76 --> 3477.54]  of
[3477.54 --> 3477.90]  sexual
[3477.90 --> 3478.48]  immorality.
[3479.22 --> 3479.30]  Right?
[3479.36 --> 3479.46]  This
[3479.46 --> 3479.58]  is
[3479.58 --> 3479.80]  probably
[3479.80 --> 3480.00]  not
[3480.00 --> 3480.20]  the
[3480.20 --> 3480.50]  first
[3480.50 --> 3481.12]  time
[3481.12 --> 3481.62]  he's
[3481.62 --> 3481.82]  done
[3481.82 --> 3482.18]  this
[3482.18 --> 3482.86]  because
[3482.86 --> 3483.44]  Tamar
[3483.44 --> 3484.98]  knows
[3484.98 --> 3486.20]  he
[3486.20 --> 3486.40]  would
[3486.40 --> 3486.58]  do
[3486.58 --> 3486.82]  it.
[3486.96 --> 3487.14]  It's
[3487.14 --> 3487.30]  part
[3487.30 --> 3487.36]  of
[3487.36 --> 3487.46]  the
[3487.46 --> 3487.78]  plan.
[3488.92 --> 3489.52]  It
[3489.52 --> 3489.92]  also
[3489.92 --> 3490.28]  says
[3490.28 --> 3490.42]  that
[3490.42 --> 3490.56]  he
[3490.56 --> 3490.82]  has
[3490.82 --> 3490.98]  a
[3490.98 --> 3491.34]  habit
[3491.34 --> 3492.32]  of
[3492.32 --> 3493.08]  worshipping
[3493.08 --> 3493.34]  the
[3493.34 --> 3493.90]  Canaanite
[3493.90 --> 3494.40]  fertility
[3494.40 --> 3494.92]  gods
[3494.92 --> 3495.54]  Baal
[3495.54 --> 3496.02]  and
[3496.02 --> 3496.58]  Asherah.
[3498.68 --> 3499.20]  Because
[3499.20 --> 3500.64]  she's a
[3500.64 --> 3500.78]  cold
[3500.78 --> 3501.10]  prostitute.
[3501.20 --> 3501.32]  This
[3501.32 --> 3501.64]  is part
[3501.64 --> 3501.84]  of the
[3501.84 --> 3502.00]  whole
[3502.00 --> 3502.38]  worship.
[3503.32 --> 3503.62]  They
[3503.62 --> 3503.76]  were
[3503.76 --> 3504.14]  fertility
[3504.14 --> 3504.54]  gods.
[3504.62 --> 3504.72]  It's
[3504.72 --> 3504.84]  the
[3504.84 --> 3505.16]  harvest.
[3505.36 --> 3505.46]  It's
[3505.46 --> 3505.58]  the
[3505.58 --> 3505.84]  shearing
[3505.84 --> 3505.98]  of
[3505.98 --> 3506.12]  the
[3506.12 --> 3506.30]  sheep
[3506.30 --> 3506.64]  time.
[3508.76 --> 3509.24]  So
[3509.24 --> 3509.40]  he
[3509.40 --> 3509.54]  is
[3509.54 --> 3509.84]  sexually
[3509.84 --> 3510.32]  immoral
[3510.32 --> 3511.28]  and
[3511.28 --> 3511.52]  he
[3511.52 --> 3511.78]  is
[3511.78 --> 3511.90]  an
[3511.90 --> 3512.46]  idolater.
[3512.58 --> 3512.64]  He
[3512.64 --> 3512.78]  is
[3512.78 --> 3513.36]  worshipping
[3513.36 --> 3513.86]  foreign
[3513.86 --> 3514.28]  gods.
[3515.24 --> 3515.44]  Her
[3515.44 --> 3515.76]  plan
[3515.76 --> 3515.96]  would
[3515.96 --> 3516.14]  have
[3516.14 --> 3516.42]  never
[3516.42 --> 3516.80]  worked
[3516.80 --> 3517.34]  unless
[3517.34 --> 3518.18]  he
[3518.18 --> 3518.62]  is
[3518.62 --> 3518.94]  that
[3518.94 --> 3519.32]  kind
[3519.32 --> 3519.46]  of
[3519.46 --> 3519.78]  guy.
[3519.78 --> 3521.22]  And
[3521.22 --> 3521.48]  because
[3521.48 --> 3521.70]  he
[3521.70 --> 3522.06]  was
[3522.06 --> 3522.26]  that
[3522.26 --> 3522.54]  kind
[3522.54 --> 3522.68]  of
[3522.68 --> 3523.06]  guy,
[3523.38 --> 3523.56]  her
[3523.56 --> 3523.96]  plan
[3523.96 --> 3524.60]  succeeds.
[3525.34 --> 3525.46]  And
[3525.46 --> 3525.72]  three
[3525.72 --> 3525.96]  months
[3525.96 --> 3526.32]  later,
[3526.42 --> 3526.62]  Judah
[3526.62 --> 3526.92]  gets
[3526.92 --> 3527.24]  word
[3527.24 --> 3527.44]  that
[3527.44 --> 3527.62]  his
[3527.62 --> 3528.12]  daughter-in-law
[3528.12 --> 3528.56]  Tamar
[3528.56 --> 3529.30]  is
[3529.30 --> 3529.64]  pregnant.
[3530.48 --> 3531.00]  But
[3531.00 --> 3531.22]  when
[3531.22 --> 3531.52]  he
[3531.52 --> 3531.92]  finds
[3531.92 --> 3532.10]  out
[3532.10 --> 3532.26]  that
[3532.26 --> 3532.58]  she's
[3532.58 --> 3532.94]  pregnant,
[3533.20 --> 3533.48]  how
[3533.48 --> 3533.64]  does
[3533.64 --> 3533.78]  he
[3533.78 --> 3534.22]  respond?
[3535.44 --> 3535.82]  Look
[3535.82 --> 3536.06]  at
[3536.06 --> 3536.52]  Judah's
[3536.52 --> 3537.26]  hypocrisy
[3537.26 --> 3537.50]  and
[3537.50 --> 3537.72]  his
[3537.72 --> 3537.98]  double
[3537.98 --> 3538.44]  standard.
[3539.52 --> 3539.90]  Judah
[3539.90 --> 3540.56]  can
[3540.56 --> 3540.76]  sleep
[3540.76 --> 3540.92]  with
[3540.92 --> 3541.28]  Tamar.
[3541.64 --> 3542.06]  It's
[3542.06 --> 3542.26]  fine
[3542.26 --> 3542.46]  for
[3542.46 --> 3542.76]  him.
[3542.90 --> 3542.98]  He
[3542.98 --> 3543.18]  does
[3543.18 --> 3543.30]  it
[3543.30 --> 3543.42]  all
[3543.42 --> 3543.52]  the
[3543.52 --> 3543.82]  time.
[3543.88 --> 3543.96]  But
[3543.96 --> 3544.08]  the
[3544.08 --> 3544.38]  instant
[3544.38 --> 3544.56]  that
[3544.56 --> 3544.68]  he
[3544.68 --> 3544.94]  finds
[3544.94 --> 3545.08]  out
[3545.08 --> 3545.24]  that
[3545.24 --> 3545.70]  Tamar
[3545.70 --> 3546.16]  is
[3546.16 --> 3546.54]  pregnant.
[3546.70 --> 3546.84]  What
[3546.84 --> 3547.00]  does
[3547.00 --> 3547.14]  he
[3547.14 --> 3547.42]  say?
[3548.32 --> 3548.74]  Bring
[3548.74 --> 3549.10]  her
[3549.10 --> 3549.64]  out
[3549.64 --> 3550.74]  and
[3550.74 --> 3551.00]  burn
[3551.00 --> 3551.18]  her
[3551.18 --> 3551.36]  to
[3551.36 --> 3551.62]  death.
[3553.48 --> 3554.20]  So
[3554.20 --> 3554.30]  it
[3554.30 --> 3554.40]  is
[3554.40 --> 3554.64]  not
[3554.64 --> 3555.18]  only
[3555.18 --> 3556.24]  that
[3556.24 --> 3557.86]  Judah's
[3557.86 --> 3558.54]  hypocrisy
[3558.54 --> 3558.96]  there,
[3559.34 --> 3559.86]  but
[3559.86 --> 3560.02]  we
[3560.02 --> 3560.46]  also
[3560.46 --> 3560.88]  see
[3560.88 --> 3561.20]  in
[3561.20 --> 3561.46]  him
[3561.46 --> 3561.68]  a
[3561.68 --> 3562.76]  murderous
[3562.76 --> 3563.84]  rage.
[3565.06 --> 3565.24]  And
[3565.24 --> 3565.36]  the
[3565.36 --> 3565.78]  original
[3565.78 --> 3566.24]  readers
[3566.24 --> 3566.46]  would
[3566.46 --> 3566.64]  have
[3566.64 --> 3566.82]  been
[3566.82 --> 3567.26]  shocked
[3567.26 --> 3567.46]  and
[3567.46 --> 3568.30]  horrified
[3568.30 --> 3568.90]  by
[3568.90 --> 3569.16]  this
[3569.16 --> 3569.68]  response.
[3569.84 --> 3570.06]  Bring
[3570.06 --> 3570.30]  her
[3570.30 --> 3570.64]  out
[3570.64 --> 3570.90]  and
[3570.90 --> 3571.24]  burn
[3571.24 --> 3571.54]  her?
[3572.70 --> 3572.94]  Right?
[3573.00 --> 3573.20]  Not
[3573.20 --> 3573.58]  let's
[3573.58 --> 3573.86]  put her
[3573.86 --> 3574.00]  on
[3574.00 --> 3574.34]  trial.
[3575.24 --> 3575.44]  Or
[3575.44 --> 3575.80]  gather
[3575.80 --> 3576.06]  some
[3576.06 --> 3576.52]  evidence
[3576.52 --> 3576.68]  or
[3576.68 --> 3577.34]  find
[3577.34 --> 3577.52]  out
[3577.52 --> 3577.70]  what
[3577.70 --> 3577.82]  is
[3577.82 --> 3578.06]  going
[3578.06 --> 3578.38]  on
[3578.38 --> 3578.76]  here.
[3579.34 --> 3579.62]  Not
[3579.62 --> 3579.80]  do
[3579.80 --> 3580.00]  the
[3580.00 --> 3580.32]  biblical
[3580.32 --> 3580.94]  thing
[3580.94 --> 3581.24]  and
[3581.24 --> 3581.48]  find
[3581.48 --> 3581.64]  out
[3581.64 --> 3581.86]  who
[3581.86 --> 3582.28]  the
[3582.28 --> 3583.00]  guy
[3583.00 --> 3583.52]  is.
[3584.48 --> 3584.72]  No,
[3584.82 --> 3585.00]  his
[3585.00 --> 3586.08]  condemnation
[3586.08 --> 3586.50]  of her
[3586.50 --> 3586.76]  is
[3586.76 --> 3587.58]  immediate
[3587.58 --> 3588.34]  and
[3588.34 --> 3588.74]  without
[3588.74 --> 3589.96]  consideration.
[3590.90 --> 3591.26]  He
[3591.26 --> 3591.76]  is on
[3591.76 --> 3591.94]  the
[3591.94 --> 3592.34]  verge
[3592.34 --> 3592.56]  of
[3592.56 --> 3593.42]  torturing
[3593.42 --> 3594.42]  and
[3594.42 --> 3595.06]  killing
[3595.06 --> 3596.12]  his
[3596.12 --> 3596.86]  daughter-in-law
[3596.86 --> 3597.40]  for
[3597.40 --> 3597.68]  something
[3597.68 --> 3598.18]  that he
[3598.18 --> 3598.56]  did
[3598.56 --> 3599.50]  regularly.
[3600.90 --> 3601.56]  Now
[3601.56 --> 3601.84]  here's
[3601.84 --> 3601.96]  the
[3601.96 --> 3602.24]  thing.
[3602.78 --> 3603.14]  Tamar
[3603.14 --> 3603.54]  is not
[3603.54 --> 3603.96]  innocent.
[3604.82 --> 3604.94]  Right?
[3604.94 --> 3605.24]  It's not
[3605.24 --> 3605.56]  like the
[3605.56 --> 3605.84]  Bible
[3605.84 --> 3606.32]  is saying
[3606.32 --> 3606.82]  that sexual
[3606.82 --> 3607.32]  entrapment
[3607.32 --> 3607.96]  is okay.
[3609.22 --> 3610.48]  The passage
[3610.48 --> 3611.26]  doesn't
[3611.26 --> 3611.48]  though
[3611.48 --> 3612.16]  comment
[3612.16 --> 3612.98]  on her
[3612.98 --> 3613.54]  actions
[3613.54 --> 3614.12]  at all.
[3614.88 --> 3615.66]  The focus
[3615.66 --> 3616.68]  is on
[3616.68 --> 3617.18]  Judah's
[3617.18 --> 3617.52]  evil.
[3618.44 --> 3618.68]  And in
[3618.68 --> 3619.18]  fact,
[3619.26 --> 3619.54]  I found
[3619.54 --> 3620.14]  this really
[3620.14 --> 3621.16]  interesting
[3621.16 --> 3622.46]  cross-reference
[3622.46 --> 3624.14]  where this
[3624.14 --> 3625.00]  is what God
[3625.00 --> 3626.06]  says about
[3626.06 --> 3626.58]  this kind
[3626.58 --> 3627.00]  of sexual
[3627.00 --> 3627.78]  double standard
[3627.78 --> 3628.12]  that was
[3628.12 --> 3628.46]  prevalent
[3628.46 --> 3629.98]  in Tamar's
[3629.98 --> 3630.46]  day and
[3630.46 --> 3630.74]  in our
[3630.74 --> 3631.26]  day still.
[3631.68 --> 3632.04]  This is
[3632.04 --> 3632.28]  what it
[3632.28 --> 3632.62]  says in
[3632.62 --> 3633.20]  Hosea
[3633.20 --> 3634.00]  chapter 4
[3634.00 --> 3634.74]  verse 14.
[3635.38 --> 3635.62]  God
[3635.62 --> 3636.08]  says,
[3636.58 --> 3636.86]  I will
[3636.86 --> 3637.88]  not punish
[3637.88 --> 3638.44]  your
[3638.44 --> 3638.86]  daughters
[3638.86 --> 3639.32]  when they
[3639.32 --> 3639.72]  turn to
[3639.72 --> 3640.42]  prostitution
[3640.42 --> 3641.56]  nor your
[3641.56 --> 3642.36]  daughters-in-law
[3642.36 --> 3642.80]  when they
[3642.80 --> 3643.58]  commit adultery
[3643.58 --> 3644.66]  because the
[3644.66 --> 3645.50]  men themselves
[3645.50 --> 3646.28]  consort with
[3646.28 --> 3647.40]  harlots and
[3647.40 --> 3648.74]  sacrifice with
[3648.74 --> 3649.06]  shine
[3649.06 --> 3649.86]  prostitutes.
[3651.34 --> 3651.88]  Interesting,
[3652.02 --> 3652.14]  right?
[3654.40 --> 3655.54]  But Tamar's
[3655.54 --> 3656.72]  not sinless,
[3657.32 --> 3658.06]  but her
[3658.06 --> 3658.80]  goal,
[3659.28 --> 3660.06]  her heart,
[3660.06 --> 3661.60]  was justice.
[3662.60 --> 3663.00]  And because
[3663.00 --> 3663.80]  she is so
[3663.80 --> 3664.22]  vulnerable,
[3664.64 --> 3665.92]  she had to
[3665.92 --> 3666.52]  go to
[3666.52 --> 3668.00]  these great
[3668.00 --> 3668.88]  extremes.
[3671.02 --> 3671.86]  And the
[3671.86 --> 3672.26]  remarkable
[3672.26 --> 3673.04]  thing is that
[3673.04 --> 3673.76]  through her
[3673.76 --> 3674.36]  surprising
[3674.36 --> 3675.22]  courage,
[3675.76 --> 3676.64]  God brought
[3676.64 --> 3677.84]  real change
[3677.84 --> 3678.52]  and restoration
[3678.52 --> 3679.16]  in this
[3679.16 --> 3679.50]  story.
[3680.02 --> 3680.58]  And that
[3680.58 --> 3681.06]  brings us to
[3681.06 --> 3681.44]  the final
[3681.44 --> 3681.92]  part of the
[3681.92 --> 3682.32]  story,
[3682.94 --> 3683.22]  God's
[3683.22 --> 3683.68]  redemption.
[3685.14 --> 3686.34]  As a result
[3686.34 --> 3687.64]  of Tamar's
[3687.64 --> 3688.26]  courage,
[3688.26 --> 3689.98]  Judah is
[3689.98 --> 3690.66]  publicly
[3690.66 --> 3692.06]  caught in
[3692.06 --> 3692.74]  his sin.
[3693.84 --> 3695.04]  Just before
[3695.04 --> 3695.82]  she's about
[3695.82 --> 3696.66]  to be killed,
[3697.18 --> 3697.84]  she sends
[3697.84 --> 3698.48]  Judah a
[3698.48 --> 3698.94]  message,
[3699.38 --> 3699.88]  and here's
[3699.88 --> 3700.12]  what it
[3700.12 --> 3700.68]  says in
[3700.68 --> 3701.30]  verse 25.
[3701.62 --> 3702.20]  She says,
[3702.64 --> 3702.96]  I am
[3702.96 --> 3703.38]  pregnant,
[3704.48 --> 3704.72]  you know,
[3704.74 --> 3704.92]  you didn't
[3704.92 --> 3705.26]  bother to
[3705.26 --> 3705.58]  ask,
[3705.70 --> 3706.40]  but I'm
[3706.40 --> 3706.90]  pregnant by
[3706.90 --> 3707.46]  the man
[3707.46 --> 3708.20]  who owns
[3708.20 --> 3708.76]  these,
[3709.02 --> 3709.58]  she said,
[3709.64 --> 3709.92]  and she
[3709.92 --> 3710.28]  added,
[3710.94 --> 3711.70]  see if you
[3711.70 --> 3712.64]  recognize
[3712.64 --> 3713.80]  whose seal
[3713.80 --> 3714.94]  and cord
[3714.94 --> 3716.08]  and staff
[3716.08 --> 3716.94]  these are.
[3718.26 --> 3719.84]  And just
[3719.84 --> 3720.58]  like that,
[3721.34 --> 3722.68]  Judah is
[3722.68 --> 3724.02]  exposed in
[3724.02 --> 3724.38]  front of
[3724.38 --> 3724.74]  everyone.
[3725.52 --> 3725.64]  Right?
[3725.80 --> 3726.36]  He is
[3726.36 --> 3727.06]  caught in
[3727.06 --> 3727.60]  his sin.
[3728.54 --> 3729.06]  And what
[3729.06 --> 3729.96]  happens next
[3729.96 --> 3730.70]  though is
[3730.70 --> 3731.38]  absolutely
[3731.38 --> 3732.00]  astounding.
[3732.84 --> 3734.48]  Because when
[3734.48 --> 3735.32]  I am caught
[3735.32 --> 3735.92]  in sin,
[3736.54 --> 3737.24]  what do I
[3737.24 --> 3737.54]  do?
[3738.74 --> 3740.80]  I brush
[3740.80 --> 3741.36]  it aside.
[3741.76 --> 3742.44]  I dismiss
[3742.44 --> 3742.86]  it.
[3743.02 --> 3743.44]  I get
[3743.44 --> 3743.96]  defensive.
[3744.38 --> 3745.00]  I deny
[3745.00 --> 3745.26]  it.
[3745.26 --> 3745.76]  I make
[3745.76 --> 3746.24]  excuses.
[3747.00 --> 3747.78]  I point
[3747.78 --> 3748.12]  the other
[3748.12 --> 3748.52]  finger.
[3748.78 --> 3749.14]  I'm the
[3749.14 --> 3749.40]  victim.
[3749.84 --> 3750.16]  It's your
[3750.16 --> 3750.50]  fault.
[3750.88 --> 3751.32]  All these
[3751.32 --> 3751.60]  things,
[3751.66 --> 3751.80]  right?
[3752.00 --> 3752.68]  When people
[3752.68 --> 3753.00]  are caught
[3753.00 --> 3753.16]  in their
[3753.16 --> 3753.30]  sin,
[3753.36 --> 3753.64]  they go
[3753.64 --> 3753.82]  on the
[3753.82 --> 3754.28]  attack.
[3754.64 --> 3754.96]  They get
[3754.96 --> 3755.38]  angry.
[3757.30 --> 3758.48]  But Tamar's
[3758.48 --> 3759.30]  words here
[3759.30 --> 3760.78]  pierce right
[3760.78 --> 3761.72]  into Judah's
[3761.72 --> 3762.30]  soul.
[3763.20 --> 3763.84]  She's laid
[3763.84 --> 3764.24]  the truth
[3764.24 --> 3764.86]  before him
[3764.86 --> 3765.30]  and for the
[3765.30 --> 3765.84]  first time
[3765.84 --> 3766.22]  in his
[3766.22 --> 3766.76]  life,
[3767.56 --> 3768.80]  he experiences
[3768.80 --> 3769.82]  conviction
[3769.82 --> 3771.14]  for his
[3771.14 --> 3771.46]  sin.
[3771.88 --> 3772.50]  In fact,
[3772.60 --> 3773.02]  we might
[3773.02 --> 3773.66]  even call
[3773.66 --> 3774.54]  it his
[3774.54 --> 3775.18]  conversion.
[3775.76 --> 3776.70]  Because if
[3776.70 --> 3777.06]  you look
[3777.06 --> 3777.56]  at Judah
[3777.56 --> 3778.66]  before this,
[3779.24 --> 3779.80]  and then if
[3779.80 --> 3780.10]  you look
[3780.10 --> 3780.40]  at his
[3780.40 --> 3780.98]  life that
[3780.98 --> 3781.50]  follows,
[3781.96 --> 3782.24]  there's
[3782.24 --> 3782.92]  every reason
[3782.92 --> 3783.50]  to believe
[3783.50 --> 3784.04]  that this
[3784.04 --> 3785.66]  moment is
[3785.66 --> 3786.34]  the singular
[3786.34 --> 3787.66]  turning point
[3787.66 --> 3789.42]  in Judah's
[3789.42 --> 3789.84]  life.
[3790.94 --> 3791.60]  In the
[3791.60 --> 3792.02]  previous
[3792.02 --> 3792.66]  chapter,
[3793.32 --> 3793.46]  okay,
[3793.52 --> 3793.96]  so this
[3793.96 --> 3794.60]  story,
[3794.80 --> 3795.74]  Genesis 38,
[3796.48 --> 3796.90]  you might
[3796.90 --> 3797.26]  not have
[3797.26 --> 3797.84]  even remembered
[3797.84 --> 3798.14]  it's in
[3798.14 --> 3798.50]  the Bible
[3798.50 --> 3799.30]  because really
[3799.30 --> 3799.82]  it's part
[3799.82 --> 3800.20]  of this
[3800.20 --> 3801.14]  larger narrative
[3801.14 --> 3802.50]  about Joseph.
[3802.78 --> 3803.18]  We're more
[3803.18 --> 3804.22]  familiar with
[3804.22 --> 3805.08]  Joseph's story.
[3805.76 --> 3806.48]  Back in
[3806.48 --> 3807.50]  chapter 37,
[3808.96 --> 3809.50]  Joseph is
[3809.50 --> 3809.86]  the younger
[3809.86 --> 3811.00]  brother of
[3811.00 --> 3812.32]  12 brothers,
[3812.46 --> 3813.08]  sons of
[3813.08 --> 3813.40]  Jacob.
[3814.08 --> 3814.64]  Judah is
[3814.64 --> 3815.26]  the oldest.
[3816.08 --> 3816.46]  Judah,
[3817.10 --> 3818.06]  what's he up
[3818.06 --> 3818.40]  to in
[3818.40 --> 3819.22]  chapter 37?
[3819.92 --> 3820.74]  He's figuring
[3820.74 --> 3821.48]  out how to
[3821.48 --> 3822.78]  murder his
[3822.78 --> 3823.58]  brother Joseph
[3823.58 --> 3825.22]  because he
[3825.22 --> 3825.60]  is filled
[3825.60 --> 3826.32]  with jealousy
[3826.32 --> 3827.08]  at Joseph's
[3827.08 --> 3827.52]  cool coat
[3827.52 --> 3828.66]  and his
[3828.66 --> 3829.62]  father's
[3829.62 --> 3830.66]  affection for
[3830.66 --> 3830.96]  Joseph.
[3831.42 --> 3832.12]  So he says,
[3832.36 --> 3832.98]  let's kill
[3832.98 --> 3833.36]  the guy.
[3833.76 --> 3833.92]  We're going to
[3833.92 --> 3834.30]  throw him in a
[3834.30 --> 3834.82]  pit and leave
[3834.82 --> 3835.14]  him there.
[3836.18 --> 3836.72]  But then,
[3836.92 --> 3837.78]  whose idea
[3837.78 --> 3838.18]  is it to
[3838.18 --> 3838.60]  sell him?
[3839.28 --> 3839.76]  Judah's.
[3840.36 --> 3841.00]  Judah says,
[3841.24 --> 3842.20]  if we kill
[3842.20 --> 3842.40]  him, we're
[3842.40 --> 3842.64]  not going to
[3842.64 --> 3842.88]  make a
[3842.88 --> 3843.16]  profit.
[3843.60 --> 3844.16]  There's a
[3844.16 --> 3844.88]  caravan van
[3844.88 --> 3845.34]  going by.
[3845.46 --> 3846.14]  Let's sell
[3846.14 --> 3847.30]  him into
[3847.30 --> 3848.14]  slavery,
[3848.44 --> 3848.90]  our brother,
[3849.56 --> 3850.08]  and make a
[3850.08 --> 3850.80]  profit instead.
[3851.38 --> 3852.16]  That is the
[3852.16 --> 3852.86]  kind of guy
[3852.86 --> 3853.60]  Judah is.
[3854.28 --> 3854.62]  And that's
[3854.62 --> 3855.42]  consistent with
[3855.42 --> 3855.94]  what we see
[3855.94 --> 3856.32]  here in
[3856.32 --> 3857.00]  chapter 38.
[3857.72 --> 3858.74]  But in a
[3858.74 --> 3859.48]  moment, all of
[3859.48 --> 3860.00]  that changes
[3860.00 --> 3860.56]  for Judah.
[3861.16 --> 3862.42]  And he sees
[3862.42 --> 3863.18]  through Tamar's
[3863.18 --> 3864.02]  words his own
[3864.02 --> 3864.74]  evil and he
[3864.74 --> 3865.28]  is convicted.
[3866.06 --> 3867.04]  It's as if
[3867.04 --> 3867.66]  there is a
[3867.66 --> 3868.38]  voice more
[3868.38 --> 3869.32]  powerful than
[3869.32 --> 3870.58]  Tamar's that
[3870.58 --> 3871.18]  is speaking
[3871.18 --> 3872.74]  through her
[3872.74 --> 3873.50]  words.
[3874.62 --> 3875.52]  I heard this
[3875.52 --> 3876.28]  illustration on
[3876.28 --> 3876.76]  this point.
[3877.76 --> 3878.62]  Have you all
[3878.62 --> 3879.62]  seen The Lion
[3879.62 --> 3880.54]  King, you know,
[3880.58 --> 3881.28]  the Disney movie?
[3882.36 --> 3883.66]  Well, there's a
[3883.66 --> 3884.22]  point in the
[3884.22 --> 3885.02]  movie where
[3885.02 --> 3886.16]  Simba, the
[3886.16 --> 3886.94]  little lion cub,
[3887.90 --> 3888.76]  and he and
[3888.76 --> 3889.38]  his friend,
[3889.96 --> 3890.30]  what's the
[3890.30 --> 3890.66]  friend's name?
[3890.66 --> 3892.14]  Is it Nala?
[3892.80 --> 3893.20]  Nala.
[3893.40 --> 3893.56]  Oh, yeah.
[3894.28 --> 3894.68]  Well, they're
[3894.68 --> 3895.54]  being chased by
[3895.54 --> 3896.32]  hyenas, right?
[3897.26 --> 3898.26]  And they're
[3898.26 --> 3899.10]  running away.
[3899.40 --> 3900.26]  They end up
[3900.26 --> 3900.92]  getting caught in
[3900.92 --> 3902.14]  this narrow ravine
[3902.14 --> 3902.92]  and they get
[3902.92 --> 3903.76]  cornered against
[3903.76 --> 3904.62]  some rocks and
[3904.62 --> 3905.58]  they're cowering
[3905.58 --> 3906.42]  and the hyenas
[3906.42 --> 3906.98]  are kind of
[3906.98 --> 3907.92]  coming up and
[3907.92 --> 3908.72]  they're laughing,
[3908.88 --> 3909.80]  their hyena laugh,
[3910.12 --> 3910.64]  and they're
[3910.64 --> 3911.88]  taunting them and
[3911.88 --> 3912.58]  they're like, oh,
[3912.62 --> 3913.18]  we're going to eat
[3913.18 --> 3913.86]  you and all this
[3913.86 --> 3914.16]  stuff.
[3914.92 --> 3915.76]  And Simba
[3915.76 --> 3917.10]  knows, you know,
[3917.14 --> 3918.00]  he's the prince and
[3918.00 --> 3918.86]  he gets up some
[3918.86 --> 3919.32]  courage.
[3919.32 --> 3919.94]  He's going to
[3919.94 --> 3920.58]  scare them off
[3920.58 --> 3921.38]  with this big roar
[3921.38 --> 3922.30]  and all he gets
[3922.30 --> 3923.18]  out is this little
[3923.18 --> 3925.38]  rawr, rawr, right?
[3925.44 --> 3926.76]  This little cub,
[3926.92 --> 3927.34]  rawr.
[3927.86 --> 3928.60]  And the hyenas,
[3928.82 --> 3929.86]  they're like, ha,
[3929.96 --> 3930.28]  you know, they
[3930.28 --> 3930.90]  just start laughing
[3930.90 --> 3931.24]  at him.
[3931.90 --> 3932.40]  And, you know,
[3932.48 --> 3933.44]  he's mad now.
[3934.20 --> 3934.56]  He's going to
[3934.56 --> 3935.10]  try it again.
[3935.16 --> 3935.92]  He musters up all
[3935.92 --> 3936.44]  of his strength.
[3936.54 --> 3937.20]  He opens his
[3937.20 --> 3938.16]  mouth and this
[3938.16 --> 3939.28]  time there's a
[3939.28 --> 3941.00]  massive, my
[3941.00 --> 3941.44]  throat's a little
[3941.44 --> 3943.28]  sore, but rawr.
[3943.98 --> 3944.34]  You know, there's
[3944.34 --> 3946.06]  this massive roar.
[3946.66 --> 3947.36]  And he's like, ooh.
[3947.36 --> 3949.20]  And the hyenas
[3949.20 --> 3950.64]  are shocked and
[3950.64 --> 3952.02]  they look up and
[3952.02 --> 3952.94]  they realize that
[3952.94 --> 3954.32]  above Simba and
[3954.32 --> 3956.18]  behind Simba is
[3956.18 --> 3958.92]  Mufasa, his
[3958.92 --> 3960.16]  father, the
[3960.16 --> 3960.50]  king.
[3961.48 --> 3962.46]  And that is kind
[3962.46 --> 3962.84]  of what is
[3962.84 --> 3963.68]  happening here in
[3963.68 --> 3964.90]  this story.
[3966.00 --> 3967.88]  Tamar says, see
[3967.88 --> 3968.74]  if you recognize
[3968.74 --> 3969.30]  these.
[3970.38 --> 3971.10]  And there's a
[3971.10 --> 3972.24]  voice that is
[3972.24 --> 3973.32]  more powerful
[3973.32 --> 3975.84]  than hers that
[3975.84 --> 3978.02]  is speaking above
[3978.02 --> 3979.00]  her and behind
[3979.00 --> 3980.10]  her and through
[3980.10 --> 3980.58]  her.
[3981.04 --> 3981.42]  And it's this
[3981.42 --> 3982.54]  voice of God that
[3982.54 --> 3983.56]  pierces Judah's
[3983.56 --> 3983.80]  heart.
[3984.50 --> 3985.34]  It's the voice of
[3985.34 --> 3986.06]  God that takes
[3986.06 --> 3987.40]  this man, his
[3987.40 --> 3989.28]  heart of stone,
[3989.88 --> 3991.20]  and makes it into
[3991.20 --> 3991.98]  a heart of flesh.
[3993.24 --> 3994.60]  And what we see,
[3995.78 --> 3996.78]  and we see this
[3996.78 --> 3997.80]  when, that God
[3997.80 --> 3999.26]  does open Judah's
[3999.26 --> 3999.98]  heart.
[4000.42 --> 4001.18]  And we see it in
[4001.18 --> 4001.90]  the next verse,
[4001.96 --> 4002.86]  in verse 26.
[4004.24 --> 4005.96]  Judah recognizes
[4005.96 --> 4007.08]  his seal, his
[4007.08 --> 4007.56]  cord, his
[4007.56 --> 4007.96]  staff.
[4009.00 --> 4009.72]  How does he
[4009.72 --> 4010.16]  respond?
[4011.06 --> 4012.00]  She is more
[4012.00 --> 4013.00]  righteous than
[4013.00 --> 4014.32]  I, since I
[4014.32 --> 4015.34]  wouldn't give her
[4015.34 --> 4016.46]  my son,
[4016.90 --> 4017.20]  Shayla.
[4018.40 --> 4018.76]  Right?
[4018.84 --> 4019.38]  Notice what he's
[4019.38 --> 4019.62]  saying.
[4019.96 --> 4020.92]  He's not saying
[4020.92 --> 4021.44]  that she is
[4021.44 --> 4022.14]  strictly righteous.
[4023.32 --> 4024.02]  He's saying
[4024.02 --> 4025.06]  compared to me,
[4025.82 --> 4026.62]  she is more
[4026.62 --> 4027.88]  righteous than I
[4027.88 --> 4028.20]  am.
[4028.28 --> 4028.80]  It's the same
[4028.80 --> 4030.22]  word, just.
[4030.88 --> 4031.64]  Righteous, just.
[4031.74 --> 4032.12]  It's the same
[4032.12 --> 4032.32]  word.
[4032.32 --> 4033.08]  She is more
[4033.08 --> 4034.78]  just than I
[4034.78 --> 4035.08]  am.
[4036.28 --> 4037.16]  He is seeing
[4037.16 --> 4038.14]  his sin for the
[4038.14 --> 4038.78]  first time.
[4039.52 --> 4040.18]  That he was not
[4040.18 --> 4041.14]  willing to provide
[4041.14 --> 4042.14]  her, his son,
[4042.42 --> 4043.12]  in marriage in
[4043.12 --> 4043.86]  accordance with the
[4043.86 --> 4044.78]  will of God and
[4044.78 --> 4045.48]  in accordance with
[4045.48 --> 4046.24]  his own promise.
[4048.24 --> 4049.64]  And God uses
[4049.64 --> 4051.12]  Tamar's courageous
[4051.12 --> 4053.36]  actions, her
[4053.36 --> 4054.92]  words, to
[4054.92 --> 4056.54]  convict Judah and
[4056.54 --> 4057.14]  bring about
[4057.14 --> 4058.58]  spiritual awakening
[4058.58 --> 4059.14]  happening in him.
[4060.14 --> 4060.80]  And then we see
[4060.80 --> 4062.20]  later on the
[4062.20 --> 4063.12]  kind of man that
[4063.12 --> 4064.00]  Judah becomes
[4064.00 --> 4064.68]  later on in
[4064.68 --> 4065.00]  Genesis.
[4065.22 --> 4065.68]  Remember, the
[4065.68 --> 4066.56]  story takes place
[4066.56 --> 4067.40]  within the
[4067.40 --> 4068.12]  Joseph narrative.
[4068.26 --> 4069.04]  So later on,
[4069.08 --> 4069.82]  they sold their
[4069.82 --> 4070.96]  son, their
[4070.96 --> 4072.78]  brother, Joseph,
[4073.00 --> 4074.28]  into slavery in
[4074.28 --> 4075.90]  Egypt in the
[4075.90 --> 4077.08]  previous chapter.
[4077.40 --> 4078.08]  And then in a few
[4078.08 --> 4079.02]  chapters later,
[4079.02 --> 4080.64]  when the family of
[4080.64 --> 4081.78]  Israel is suffering
[4081.78 --> 4082.60]  from a famine,
[4082.78 --> 4083.70]  all of the brothers
[4083.70 --> 4084.78]  end up in Egypt.
[4084.78 --> 4087.24]  And what
[4087.24 --> 4087.58]  happens?
[4087.68 --> 4088.28]  Their youngest
[4088.28 --> 4089.86]  brother that they
[4089.86 --> 4090.46]  think is alive,
[4090.92 --> 4091.80]  the youngest, the
[4091.80 --> 4092.18]  very youngest,
[4092.30 --> 4094.52]  Benjamin, he ends
[4094.52 --> 4095.98]  up being accused of
[4095.98 --> 4096.30]  theft.
[4097.14 --> 4098.24]  And he's going to be
[4098.24 --> 4098.98]  thrown into prison.
[4100.16 --> 4100.96]  And it's at that
[4100.96 --> 4102.86]  point that Judah
[4102.86 --> 4104.50]  steps forward.
[4105.26 --> 4106.42]  And Judah is the
[4106.42 --> 4107.76]  one who volunteers
[4107.76 --> 4110.22]  to give his life as
[4110.22 --> 4111.92]  collateral for the
[4111.92 --> 4113.34]  life of his younger
[4113.34 --> 4114.36]  brother, Benjamin.
[4114.78 --> 4116.54]  When Benjamin is
[4116.54 --> 4117.46]  accused and he's
[4117.46 --> 4118.06]  going to have to be
[4118.06 --> 4119.08]  punished, it's Judah
[4119.08 --> 4121.12]  who says, blame me.
[4121.84 --> 4123.50]  Let me be detained.
[4124.50 --> 4126.32]  Let my brother go
[4126.32 --> 4126.72]  free.
[4128.28 --> 4128.36]  Right?
[4128.62 --> 4130.14]  Judah is now asking
[4130.14 --> 4131.32]  to be the
[4131.32 --> 4131.74]  substitute.
[4133.08 --> 4133.80]  And then when we
[4133.80 --> 4134.66]  zoom out even
[4134.66 --> 4136.72]  further, though
[4136.72 --> 4137.68]  Tamar would not
[4137.68 --> 4138.64]  have known it at
[4138.64 --> 4140.50]  the time, God
[4140.50 --> 4142.06]  used Tamar's
[4142.06 --> 4143.24]  courageous actions
[4143.24 --> 4144.16]  to bring redemption,
[4144.16 --> 4145.10]  not just to Judah,
[4145.66 --> 4147.86]  but to us, to the
[4147.86 --> 4148.68]  whole world, because
[4148.68 --> 4149.76]  the bloodline of the
[4149.76 --> 4151.16]  Messiah goes through
[4151.16 --> 4153.56]  Judah by way of
[4153.56 --> 4153.98]  Tamar.
[4155.64 --> 4156.42]  And what Jesus'
[4156.76 --> 4157.70]  great, great, great,
[4157.70 --> 4158.84]  great grandfather,
[4158.84 --> 4161.24]  Judah, wanted to do
[4161.24 --> 4161.92]  for his brother,
[4162.06 --> 4163.26]  Benjamin, substituting
[4163.26 --> 4164.08]  himself for his
[4164.08 --> 4165.48]  brother's life, Jesus
[4165.48 --> 4167.34]  came and he did for us.
[4167.34 --> 4171.12]  He came and he said,
[4171.40 --> 4172.30]  I'll take the blame.
[4173.66 --> 4174.82]  Take me instead,
[4175.40 --> 4176.40]  let them go free.
[4176.96 --> 4177.68]  And at the last
[4177.68 --> 4178.94]  minute when Jesus was
[4178.94 --> 4180.72]  condemned, he didn't
[4180.72 --> 4182.06]  produce proof of his
[4182.06 --> 4182.96]  righteousness, did he?
[4183.52 --> 4184.76]  Although he had it in
[4184.76 --> 4186.46]  spades, he was
[4186.46 --> 4187.46]  perfectly innocent.
[4188.22 --> 4190.20]  But instead, he chose
[4190.20 --> 4192.16]  to die for us,
[4192.16 --> 4193.72]  to take all of the
[4193.72 --> 4195.40]  injustice of the world
[4195.40 --> 4197.48]  on himself and bear it
[4197.48 --> 4199.22]  as our substitute
[4199.22 --> 4201.38]  so that we could be
[4201.38 --> 4203.48]  forgiven for all of our
[4203.48 --> 4205.20]  injustice, so that we
[4205.20 --> 4205.96]  could go free.
[4208.66 --> 4209.54]  You know what's really
[4209.54 --> 4210.20]  interesting, too?
[4212.20 --> 4213.30]  We don't get to choose
[4213.30 --> 4214.26]  our families, do we?
[4214.26 --> 4216.32]  But you know who got
[4216.32 --> 4217.50]  to choose his family?
[4219.04 --> 4219.52]  Jesus.
[4220.52 --> 4220.72]  Right?
[4220.78 --> 4221.28]  He's God.
[4222.40 --> 4225.30]  God got to choose
[4225.30 --> 4226.98]  his ancestors.
[4227.98 --> 4230.70]  And he chose Tamar.
[4231.70 --> 4233.36]  He chose to identify
[4233.36 --> 4235.52]  with a brilliant,
[4236.12 --> 4238.50]  broken woman who had
[4238.50 --> 4239.68]  suffered extreme
[4239.68 --> 4240.46]  injustice.
[4241.52 --> 4242.28]  Do you know who else
[4242.28 --> 4243.24]  God identified with?
[4243.24 --> 4245.20]  He identified with
[4245.20 --> 4245.52]  Judah.
[4246.06 --> 4247.36]  He identified with a
[4247.36 --> 4249.22]  wicked man whose
[4249.22 --> 4250.32]  heart he had changed.
[4251.34 --> 4252.60]  That's the kind of
[4252.60 --> 4253.60]  God we serve.
[4254.84 --> 4256.56]  He identifies with us,
[4257.06 --> 4257.32]  sinners.
[4258.22 --> 4259.68]  He came to save us.
[4260.88 --> 4263.70]  He says, I want you
[4263.70 --> 4265.12]  to become part of my
[4265.12 --> 4265.48]  family.
[4266.32 --> 4267.20]  He says, I want you
[4267.20 --> 4267.96]  to trust me.
[4268.34 --> 4270.10]  I really am a
[4270.10 --> 4271.76]  friend of sinners.
[4273.24 --> 4274.62]  Would you please pray
[4274.62 --> 4274.98]  with me?
[4278.72 --> 4279.78]  Heavenly Father, we
[4279.78 --> 4283.38]  thank you for this
[4283.38 --> 4285.06]  family tree that we
[4285.06 --> 4286.36]  also belong to.
[4287.04 --> 4288.26]  You have grafted us
[4288.26 --> 4289.08]  into this family.
[4289.78 --> 4290.86]  You have made us
[4290.86 --> 4292.64]  brothers and sisters
[4292.64 --> 4294.20]  of Christ, our eldest
[4294.20 --> 4294.62]  brother.
[4296.18 --> 4298.08]  And Lord, Tamar is our
[4298.08 --> 4300.44]  great grandmother in the
[4300.44 --> 4300.76]  faith.
[4302.32 --> 4303.06]  And Lord, we thank you
[4303.06 --> 4304.52]  for her story, her
[4304.52 --> 4305.30]  story, Lord, even
[4305.30 --> 4307.42]  though she was caught
[4307.42 --> 4309.68]  up in the mire of a
[4309.68 --> 4310.44]  sinful and broken
[4310.44 --> 4310.90]  world.
[4311.64 --> 4312.66]  Lord, through her,
[4313.32 --> 4314.16]  through her children,
[4314.34 --> 4316.36]  you broke in and you
[4316.36 --> 4317.74]  are continuing to break
[4317.74 --> 4320.06]  in to our stories.
[4321.06 --> 4322.08]  Lord, we all have
[4322.08 --> 4325.26]  families that are messy
[4325.26 --> 4326.42]  in one way or another.
[4326.42 --> 4327.86]  Lord, Jesus, you had a
[4327.86 --> 4328.70]  messy family too.
[4329.82 --> 4330.76]  But Lord, you came to
[4330.76 --> 4332.56]  redeem us and to bring
[4332.56 --> 4333.40]  us into your family.
[4334.06 --> 4336.20]  We thank you for that,
[4336.30 --> 4336.40]  Lord.
[4336.44 --> 4337.14]  We thank you that you
[4337.14 --> 4338.72]  did come and you did
[4338.72 --> 4339.84]  come to redeem us.
[4340.58 --> 4342.06]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4342.52 --> 4342.88]  Amen.
[4344.42 --> 4345.60]  So for our song of
[4345.60 --> 4348.08]  response, there's a song
[4348.08 --> 4350.10]  that I heard about by a
[4350.10 --> 4350.68]  group called the
[4350.68 --> 4351.36]  Porter's Gate.
[4352.02 --> 4353.54]  It's not a song that we've
[4353.54 --> 4354.62]  sung before, but I thought
[4354.62 --> 4355.48]  it would be appropriate
[4355.48 --> 4356.84]  because of the words to
[4356.84 --> 4357.30]  sing it.
[4357.92 --> 4359.60]  It's kind of a gospel
[4359.60 --> 4359.98]  song.
[4360.08 --> 4361.12]  It's kind of got a rhythm
[4361.12 --> 4364.18]  that we're maybe not
[4364.18 --> 4364.66]  used to.
[4365.64 --> 4366.62]  And so what, you know, I
[4366.62 --> 4367.40]  talked to Paul about it
[4367.40 --> 4368.50]  and what we decided is
[4368.50 --> 4369.04]  we're going to actually
[4369.04 --> 4370.66]  put up a lyric video.
[4371.08 --> 4371.64]  So we're going to show a
[4371.64 --> 4371.94]  video.
[4372.40 --> 4373.04]  So we're going to have
[4373.04 --> 4373.52]  the music.
[4373.66 --> 4374.06]  We're going to have the
[4374.06 --> 4374.44]  words.
[4374.52 --> 4375.42]  I invite you just to sing
[4375.42 --> 4376.90]  along as you're able,
[4377.12 --> 4378.06]  but also Paul's going to
[4378.06 --> 4378.86]  be playing and we're
[4378.86 --> 4379.78]  going to have some live
[4379.78 --> 4380.44]  sound as well.
[4380.70 --> 4382.46]  But let's give it a shot
[4382.46 --> 4383.86]  and let's enjoy it and
[4383.86 --> 4385.46]  consider the music.
[4385.46 --> 4386.12]  to the words that it
[4386.12 --> 4386.42]  says.
[4386.42 --> 4391.42]  Why will the truth come out?
[4391.42 --> 4392.42]  When will the truth come out?
[4392.42 --> 4394.42]  When will the truth come out?
[4394.42 --> 4399.42]  When will the truth come out?
[4399.42 --> 4401.42]  When will your justice roll down?
[4401.42 --> 4402.42]  When will your kingdom come?
[4402.42 --> 4404.42]  When will your justice roll down?
[4404.42 --> 4405.42]  When will your kingdom come?
[4405.42 --> 4407.42]  When will your kingdom come?
[4407.42 --> 4408.42]  When will your kingdom come?
[4408.42 --> 4412.42]  When will your kingdom come?
[4412.42 --> 4413.42]  When will the undone?
[4413.42 --> 4419.42]  When will the wicked need?
[4419.42 --> 4421.42]  When will the wicked need?
[4421.42 --> 4423.42]  When will the wicked end?
[4423.42 --> 4428.46]  When will your kingdom come?
[4430.92 --> 4434.24]  And he will be undone
[4434.24 --> 4440.42]  When will the wicked kneel
[4440.42 --> 4445.70]  And the abused leave
[4445.70 --> 4451.90]  When will our sisters speak?
[4453.42 --> 4457.74]  With no more shame or fear
[4457.74 --> 4465.36]  How long, how long
[4465.36 --> 4473.58]  When will the daughters of Zion rejoice
[4473.58 --> 4479.50]  In the house of the Lord
[4483.42 --> 4486.66]  Out of the miry clay
[4486.66 --> 4492.42]  We will rise up someday
[4492.42 --> 4498.80]  Sorrow won't always last
[4498.80 --> 4504.58]  The dark will surely pass
[4504.58 --> 4509.80]  Woe to the wicked ones
[4510.36 --> 4515.80]  For what their hands have done
[4515.80 --> 4522.12]  God is our righteous judge
[4522.12 --> 4527.80]  And he will raise us up
[4527.80 --> 4535.18]  So how long, how long
[4535.18 --> 4543.18]  When will the daughters of Zion rejoice
[4543.18 --> 4549.18]  In the house of the Lord
[4549.18 --> 4561.18]  So let your justice roll down
[4561.18 --> 4567.18]  Let your justice roll down
[4567.18 --> 4574.18]  Let your justice roll down
[4574.18 --> 4579.18]  Let your justice roll down
[4579.18 --> 4582.18]  Let your justice roll down
[4582.18 --> 4589.18]  How long, how long
[4589.18 --> 4593.18]  How long
[4593.18 --> 4597.18]  How long
[4597.18 --> 4599.18]  How long
[4599.18 --> 4606.18]  When will the daughters of Zion rejoice
[4606.18 --> 4612.18]  In the house of the Lord
[4612.18 --> 4619.18]  When will the daughters of Zion rejoice
[4619.18 --> 4625.18]  In the house of the Lord
[4625.18 --> 4626.18]  The Lord
[4626.18 --> 4643.68]  The deacons will come forward for the offering now
[4643.68 --> 4645.68]  Thank you
[4673.68 --> 4703.66]  Thank you.
[4703.68 --> 4733.66]  Thank you.
[4733.68 --> 4763.66]  Thank you.
[4763.68 --> 4793.66]  Thank you.
[4793.68 --> 4823.66]  Thank you.
[4823.68 --> 4853.66]  Thank you.
[4853.68 --> 4883.66]  Thank you.
[4883.68 --> 4887.76]  Shall we come to our God and Father in prayer?
[4887.76 --> 4900.72]  Thank you, Lord, for your word to us this morning that has application in all of our lives.
[4900.72 --> 4907.82]  We are grateful for your calling, for your forgiveness and for a new life.
[4907.82 --> 4914.22]  Thank you for your invitation to come and worship you, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[4914.22 --> 4925.10]  Thank you for your prayers, thank you, and we pray for our hearts and minds to take in the message and work it out in our daily prayer and practice.
[4925.10 --> 4933.20]  We confess that we confess that we have faith, we have faith, we have faith, and we have faith in our faith.
[4933.20 --> 4936.44]  We have not loved you with our whole heart, strength, and mind.
[4936.44 --> 4946.38]  We pray for our hearts and we are thankful that we have faith in our faith, we have faith in our faith, and we have faith in our faith.
[4946.38 --> 4953.58]  We pray for mercy and forgiveness and are thankful that you give us new opportunities every morning to serve you in ways that will bring you honor and glory throughout the day.
[4953.58 --> 4966.04]  We confess that our world belongs to you, and so when we see so many nations in turmoil, we cling to the sure hope that you will restore all things to yourself.
[4967.12 --> 4973.94]  In the meantime, we pray for an end to the carnage, especially in Ukraine, but other countries too.
[4974.66 --> 4976.92]  We pray for paths to peace.
[4978.10 --> 4983.34]  We pray for the many who have lost loved ones as a result of aggression and war.
[4983.58 --> 4990.48]  We pray for the leadership of the various levels of government, be it local, provincial, or federal.
[4991.56 --> 4994.26]  The work is difficult and the responsibilities many.
[4995.52 --> 5006.50]  As is true in our lives, so may it be with those who lead, that they do so with humility, ensuring that justice prevails and mercy will be extended.
[5006.50 --> 5019.90]  We pray for the flu season ramping up as well as COVID, that for hospitals and staff, as they seek to treat cases and work at prevention measures.
[5019.90 --> 5028.08]  We pray for those who are particularly vulnerable to these viruses and are thankful for the vaccines that minimize the risk.
[5028.08 --> 5030.08]  We pray for those who are going to be with those who are vulnerable to these viruses and are thankful for those who are in touch with us.
[5030.08 --> 5034.46]  We pray for the lives of members and friends of our congregation.
[5035.46 --> 5040.08]  For Pastor Nancy, as she recovers from her surgery that took place past week.
[5040.98 --> 5051.70]  We are thankful that the surgery went well, but there is a road ahead for recovery, and we pray for strength as that carries on, continues.
[5051.70 --> 5059.40]  We thank you that Pastor Jason could be with us this morning to bring your message, as he was not feeling well earlier on.
[5061.18 --> 5074.06]  We remember Grace Koystra, who's in the hospital, and we pray that she may heal, may get well, and that we'd like to see her home by Christmas.
[5074.06 --> 5080.06]  We pray for her, and we pray for the doctor, as she regains strength from her recent operation.
[5080.06 --> 5084.06]  For Pat Bowman, diagnosed with cancer.
[5088.06 --> 5090.06]  We pray for healing.
[5090.06 --> 5094.06]  We pray for Jordan Van Tall who is also undergoing treatment for cancer.
[5094.06 --> 5097.06]  And we pray for that young family.
[5097.06 --> 5102.06]  We are thankful that Richie Hendrickson continues to be doing very well,
[5102.06 --> 5108.06]  and that you will give him strength in his immediate family and grandparents as well,
[5108.06 --> 5113.06]  as he faces still yet another upcoming procedure.
[5114.06 --> 5117.06]  We thank you that Joyce can be with us this morning.
[5118.06 --> 5123.06]  And we continue to pray for Jerry and Anne who are living at Augustin Home.
[5123.06 --> 5127.06]  We remember Carl Geronimus and Mark Miller.
[5128.06 --> 5130.06]  For Quinn and Alana Pooley.
[5131.06 --> 5136.06]  And that Quinn is doing well and recovering slowly.
[5137.06 --> 5141.06]  We pray for Shirley Rass, her ongoing pain.
[5142.06 --> 5144.06]  Living with pain is hard, Lord.
[5144.06 --> 5146.06]  And we pray for strength and patience.
[5146.06 --> 5148.06]  We pray for Diane Smith.
[5148.06 --> 5153.06]  We remember Jeanette Vanderwood at Delta View.
[5154.06 --> 5155.06]  John Van Tall.
[5156.06 --> 5157.06]  Henry Vugdevine.
[5158.06 --> 5159.06]  John Zylstra.
[5159.06 --> 5161.06]  Aileen Hureidout, Lord.
[5161.06 --> 5166.06]  Again, a difficult journey and almost seems never-ending.
[5167.06 --> 5174.06]  But we pray for healing and for wisdom in all those who take care of her particular needs, too.
[5174.06 --> 5177.06]  And Lord, we pray for those who suffer from depression.
[5177.06 --> 5178.06]  Often silently.
[5179.06 --> 5182.06]  We ask for strength.
[5183.06 --> 5186.06]  And we want to remember the health care providers.
[5186.06 --> 5194.06]  It seems as though hospitals and health care providers are strained to the maximum.
[5195.06 --> 5198.06]  Lord, would you provide help in those areas.
[5198.06 --> 5203.06]  We are grateful for the health help that we can receive.
[5204.06 --> 5209.06]  But we pray for others who so desperately need it and more immediately, too.
[5210.06 --> 5213.06]  We give thanks to you, God, for your fatherly care.
[5214.06 --> 5217.06]  For your mercy and love that you show each of us day after day.
[5217.06 --> 5221.06]  You provide for us in times of health and in times of sickness.
[5222.06 --> 5226.06]  Thank you for the testimonies of so many who have testified to your care,
[5227.06 --> 5229.06]  especially during times of sickness and hardships.
[5230.06 --> 5237.06]  We pray for the leadership of this church that you will continue to give them wisdom to lead this, your congregation,
[5237.06 --> 5245.06]  to be all that you have called us to be and to provide the means that enable every member to excel in the gifts that you have given us.
[5246.06 --> 5254.06]  Thank you for all those who are already so ably using their gifts in this congregation, but also using their gifts in the community at large.
[5254.06 --> 5264.06]  We pray that the offerings received for Cascade Christian Counseling will help to support the many causes that they are working with, too.
[5265.06 --> 5272.06]  We pray this in your name because yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever. Amen.
