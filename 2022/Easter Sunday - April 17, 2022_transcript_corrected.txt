[0.00 → 5.52] every stony heart of sinners, even to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5.88 → 10.58] Glory be to you, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and forever. Amen.
[11.58 → 14.10] Would you please rise in body or spirit as you are able.
[15.02 → 18.88] God greets us with these words from our risen Lord in John chapter 10.
[19.52 → 25.20] Jesus said, I have come that they may have life and may have it to the full.
[25.20 → 30.18] Friends, as the Lord has greeted us and called us and gathered us together,
[30.44 → 33.52] let's turn and greet one another, saying, Christ is risen.
[55.20 → 58.70] God, Lord, is in nature.
[61.34 → 62.06] Amen.
[62.06 → 63.06] Amen.
[92.06 → 102.06] All creation joined to say, Hallelujah.
[102.06 → 112.06] Rejoice and joyous song, Hallelujah.
[112.06 → 125.06] Sing our heads and heads with God, Hallelujah.
[125.06 → 135.06] Our redeeming world is now, Hallelujah.
[135.06 → 146.06] Call them, find them at the wall, Hallelujah.
[146.06 → 156.06] Yet we bid for it in once, Hallelujah.
[156.06 → 169.06] Christ has opened paradise, Hallelujah.
[169.06 → 181.06] For we know where Christ has led, Hallelujah.
[181.06 → 191.06] Falling of exalted dead, Hallelujah.
[191.06 → 202.06] May like him, like him, we rise, Hallelujah.
[202.06 → 214.06] Hearts that are lost, that break the skies, Hallelujah.
[214.06 → 232.06] May like him, like him, like him, Hallelujah.
[232.06 → 242.06] Hail the Lord of the dead, Hallelujah.
[242.06 → 253.06] Praise to you, Lord, be given, Hallelujah.
[253.06 → 264.06] Praise him, Christ, Lord, evermore, Hallelujah.
[264.06 → 276.06] And every day to you shall bow, Hallelujah.
[284.06 → 285.06] You may be seated.
[285.06 → 297.06] So today I want to invite us all to read this Easter litany.
[297.06 → 302.06] It's adapted from what is called the exultant, exult let.
[302.06 → 307.06] As you can see, it's an Easter hymn originating from the 5th to 7th century.
[307.06 → 308.06] So it's responsive.
[308.06 → 313.06] So I'll read and then where it's double arrow, I'll invite you to read.
[313.06 → 323.06] Rejoice heavenly powers, sing choirs of angels, exult all creation around God's throne.
[323.06 → 325.06] Jesus Christ, our King is risen.
[325.06 → 328.06] Sound the trumpet of salvation.
[328.06 → 333.06] Rejoice heavenly powers, sing choirs of angels,
[333.06 → 337.06] Jesus Christ, our King is risen.
[337.06 → 343.06] Rejoice, O earth, in shining splendour, radiant in the brightness of your King.
[343.06 → 350.06] Christ has conquered, glory fills you, darkness vanishes forever.
[350.06 → 357.06] Rejoice heavenly powers, sing choirs of angels,
[357.06 → 360.06] Jesus Christ, our King is risen.
[360.06 → 365.06] Rejoice, O Mother Church, exult in glory.
[365.06 → 367.06] The risen Saviour shines upon you.
[367.06 → 374.06] Let this place resound with joy, echoing the mighty song of all God's people.
[374.06 → 377.06] He is King of kings.
[377.06 → 379.06] He is Lord of lords.
[379.06 → 380.06] Hallelujah.
[380.06 → 383.06] So let's sing one more song.
[383.06 → 384.06] We'll stay seated.
[384.06 → 387.06] And then for the next one after that, we can all rise again.
[387.06 → 388.06] Let's get to the next one.
[388.06 → 389.06] Amen.
[389.06 → 390.06] Christ has selected for grace very long for his Lord.
[390.06 → 391.06] Father, let this circle Whoops to Oprah's voice on his knees.
[391.06 → 392.06] Amen.
[392.06 → 393.64] Soup was ever strong by an in the full Cup of我不知道.
[393.64 → 394.06] Part 2.
[394.06 → 394.70] Prince is inferior to the metallic aluminic and elite lam spots.

[396.72 → 397.70] Amen.

[398.70 → 399.70] Amen.

[400.70 → 403.70] Thank you.
[407.22 → 411.08] I'm than a challenge.
[411.10 → 412.54] I leave you here in Your line, worship God's holy grace.
[412.54 → 413.62] We thank you to sin.
[413.72 → 414.64] I live for joy.
[414.64 → 416.32] I live you tonight,
[416.32 → 446.30] THE END
[446.32 → 451.32] Because he lives
[451.90 → 455.32] Up in his home
[456.00 → 459.32] Because I know
[459.32 → 463.32] He holds the future
[464.32 → 467.32] Then life is worth
[467.32 → 469.32] And it just
[469.32 → 472.32] Because he lives
[472.32 → 477.32] Because he lives
[477.32 → 481.32] I can't live tomorrow
[481.32 → 485.32] Because he lives
[485.32 → 490.32] Up in his home
[490.32 → 494.32] Because I know
[494.32 → 498.32] He holds the future
[498.32 → 502.32] And life is worth
[502.32 → 504.32] And it just
[504.32 → 508.32] Because he lives
[515.32 → 517.32] It's all right, Sean
[517.32 → 520.32] And now
[520.32 → 522.32] He Happened
[522.32 → 524.32] And now
[524.32 → 525.32] If your sorrow
[525.32 → 530.32] And now
[531.32 → 536.32] He has loud
[536.32 → 537.32] And now
[537.32 → 546.76] Oh, in the grave he lay, Jesus my Saviour.
[547.96 → 557.76] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[557.76 → 565.64] How from the grave he adores, when the mighty joy flows.
[565.64 → 571.64] He arose, he arose, the winter of the dark coming.
[571.64 → 577.64] Hedges, forever with his sins to him.
[577.64 → 590.64] He arose, he arose, hallelujah, was the rose.
[590.64 → 600.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Saviour.
[600.64 → 604.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[604.64 → 612.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[612.64 → 616.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[616.64 → 622.64] How from the grave he arose, when the mighty joy flows.
[622.64 → 628.64] He arose, the winter of the dark coming.
[628.64 → 630.64] He arose, the winter of the dark coming.
[630.64 → 634.64] And he gives forever, he sings to him.
[634.64 → 640.64] He arose, he arose, hallelujah, was the rose.
[640.64 → 650.64] He arose, hallelujah, was the rose.
[650.64 → 660.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Saviour.
[660.64 → 673.64] Death cannot be misplay, Jesus my Saviour.
[673.64 → 683.64] Waging the coming day, Jesus my Lord.
[683.64 → 689.64] How from the grave he arose, when the mighty joy flows.
[689.64 → 693.64] He arose, the winter of the dark coming.
[693.64 → 699.64] He arose, the winter of the dark coming.
[699.64 → 704.64] He gives forever, he sings to him.
[704.64 → 717.64] Now, Alleluia, Christ have come.
[717.64 → 735.46] So I think at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[747.64 → 777.08] And we here, we now come to a time of confession where we look to the risen Christ for our hope, for our own lives, and the forgiveness that he secured for us.
[777.64 → 780.28] Let's pray.
[781.42 → 790.82] Have mercy on us, O Lord, for all the many ways we are still in bondage to sin, which keeps us in bondage to death.
[792.06 → 796.48] Deliver us from the patterns of our lives that hurt others and ourselves.
[798.58 → 807.14] Deliver us from the dark motivations of our hearts that poison even the good we do with self-centredness and pride.
[808.48 → 812.68] Deliver us from the evil that seeks to undo us.
[812.68 → 842.68] 
[842.68 → 846.96] The resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
[847.52 → 853.30] For as in Adam all die, so in Christ will all be made alive.
[853.96 → 854.26] Hallelujah.
[854.26 → 854.38] Hallelujah.
[855.98 → 858.44] Let's stand and let's sing our song of response together.
[858.44 → 858.60] Father.
[858.60 → 859.60] Amen.
[888.60 → 904.38] Let God like you all of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[904.38 → 926.54] My comfort, my shelter, power of refuge and strength, let every breath, all that I am, ever cease to worship you.
[926.54 → 937.98] Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing, power and majesty, praise to the King.
[937.98 → 948.74] Mountains come down in the seas of war, and the summer of your name.
[948.74 → 958.74] I sing for joy and the work of your hands, forever alone and forever I'll stand.
[960.02 → 966.74] Nothing compares to the promise I have with you.
[966.74 → 979.74] My Jesus, my Saviour, the very sound of my view.
[979.74 → 991.74] All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[991.74 → 1013.74] My comfort, my shelter, power of refuge and strength, let every breath, all that I am, ever cease to worship you.
[1013.74 → 1025.74] Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing, power and majesty, praise to the King.
[1025.74 → 1035.74] Mountains come down in the seas of the Lord, and the summer of your name.
[1035.74 → 1047.74] I sing for joy and the work of your hands, forever alone and forever I'll stand.
[1047.74 → 1057.74] Nothing compares to the promise I have with you.
[1057.74 → 1085.74] The reading this morning is from Luke 24, verses 1 to 12.
[1085.74 → 1093.74] On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
[1093.74 → 1102.74] They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[1102.74 → 1110.74] While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
[1110.74 → 1115.74] In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground.
[1115.74 → 1120.74] But the men said to them, Why, do you look for the living among the dead?
[1120.74 → 1123.74] He is not here. He has risen.
[1123.74 → 1137.74] Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee, the Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified, and on the third day be raised again.
[1137.74 → 1140.74] Then they remembered his words.
[1140.74 → 1147.74] When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the others.
[1147.74 → 1157.74] It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.
[1157.74 → 1164.74] But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.
[1164.74 → 1167.74] Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb.
[1167.74 → 1177.74] Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
[1177.74 → 1179.74] This is the word of the Lord.
[1179.74 → 1181.74] Thanks be to God.
[1181.74 → 1195.74] Would you please pray with me?
[1195.74 → 1206.74] Our Father, we pray that as we now read and reflect on this glorious story of the first Easter morning,
[1206.74 → 1212.74] that in it and through it that you would meet us here today,
[1212.74 → 1221.74] and that we would hear these words freshly and respond to them with obedience, with faith, with love, and with hope.
[1221.74 → 1225.74] We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1225.74 → 1226.74] Good morning.
[1226.74 → 1227.74] Good morning.
[1227.74 → 1229.74] Christ is risen.
[1229.74 → 1230.74] Good morning.
[1230.74 → 1233.74] It's good to hear you say that.
[1233.74 → 1237.74] And it's wonderful that we can celebrate Easter Sunday together.
[1237.74 → 1242.74] So friends, we're here remembering what happened on that first glorious Easter morning,
[1242.74 → 1245.74] when Jesus conquered death.
[1245.74 → 1250.74] And I want us to begin this morning by thinking a little bit about death itself.
[1250.74 → 1255.74] Three friends were discussing death one day.
[1255.74 → 1258.74] When one of them asked this question to the group, he asked,
[1258.74 → 1264.74] what would you like said about you at your funeral?
[1264.74 → 1268.74] I wonder how you would respond.
[1268.74 → 1274.74] What would you like said about you at your funeral?
[1274.74 → 1281.74] The first guy thought about it and then replied, you know, just say that he really helped people.
[1281.74 → 1283.74] He cared deeply for his community.
[1283.74 → 1285.74] He was a humanitarian.
[1285.74 → 1293.74] The second guy replied, say that he was a great husband and father, and who was an example to others.
[1293.74 → 1300.74] The third guy smirked and said, honestly, what would I like said at my funeral?
[1300.74 → 1302.74] Look, he's moving.
[1302.74 → 1309.74] Don't we all wish that was said at our funeral?
[1309.74 → 1313.74] But we know that doesn't happen, right?
[1313.74 → 1318.74] People don't rise from the dead.
[1318.74 → 1325.74] I mean, if anyone actually did rise from the dead, that would change everything.
[1325.74 → 1330.74] It would require a complete reassessment of reality.
[1330.74 → 1335.74] It would overturn everything we thought we knew about life.
[1335.74 → 1342.74] And friends, what we are saying today is that this is exactly what happened on Easter Sunday.
[1342.74 → 1350.74] So this morning, there are two things, two simple things I want us to consider together about what this glorious thing that happened on the first Easter Sunday.
[1350.74 → 1353.74] First, that resurrection has happened.
[1353.74 → 1359.74] Then secondly, that resurrection is happening.
[1359.74 → 1360.74] Two things.
[1360.74 → 1362.74] Resurrection has happened.
[1362.74 → 1365.74] Resurrection is happening.
[1365.74 → 1366.74] So let's look at this together.
[1366.74 → 1369.74] First, resurrection has happened.
[1369.74 → 1372.74] And let's begin by looking now at the past.
[1372.74 → 1373.74] What happened?
[1373.74 → 1374.74] What is the story?
[1374.74 → 1389.74] On the first day of the week, in verse one, on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices that they had prepared and went to the tomb.
[1389.74 → 1391.74] What are they doing?
[1391.74 → 1393.74] What are these women doing?
[1393.74 → 1395.74] I'll tell you what they're doing.
[1395.74 → 1402.74] They were going to honour the dead body of Jesus and make his corpse smell better.
[1402.74 → 1405.74] That's what they're doing.
[1405.74 → 1406.74] Right?
[1406.74 → 1413.74] On that Sunday morning, these brave women left their home while it was still dark, and they headed toward the tomb.
[1413.74 → 1421.74] And with each step toward the tomb, they would have been reminded of their broken dreams and their broken hearts.
[1421.74 → 1422.74] Why?
[1422.74 → 1427.74] Because they believed he was dead.
[1427.74 → 1433.74] They had not the faintest idea that he might have risen from the dead.
[1433.74 → 1434.74] Right?
[1434.74 → 1439.74] They were not thinking, oh, let's just bring along these spices just in case he's dead.
[1439.74 → 1440.74] Right?
[1440.74 → 1441.74] No.
[1441.74 → 1443.74] They were going to embalm a corpse.
[1443.74 → 1446.74] They hadn't done it yet because Jesus died on Friday.
[1446.74 → 1451.74] It was the day of preparation before the Jewish Sabbath, Shabbat.
[1451.74 → 1453.74] Saturday, they were devout Jewish women.
[1453.74 → 1455.74] They couldn't do anything.
[1455.74 → 1468.74] But that Sunday morning, bright and early, they went to the tomb to finish the burial.
[1468.74 → 1471.74] They were completely not expecting the resurrection.
[1471.74 → 1475.74] Let's keep looking here in verse 2.
[1475.74 → 1479.74] They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
[1479.74 → 1487.74] But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus while they were wondering about this.
[1487.74 → 1490.74] Now, the translation doesn't go far enough.
[1490.74 → 1491.74] Right?
[1491.74 → 1496.74] The women were not just standing around like, now I wonder what happened to that body.
[1496.74 → 1499.74] Just like they misplaced a set of keys.
[1499.74 → 1503.74] That word wonder, they were perplexed.
[1503.74 → 1504.74] They were bewildered.
[1504.74 → 1508.74] They were in a state of utter confusion and disorientation.
[1508.74 → 1510.74] They didn't know what to do.
[1510.74 → 1513.74] None of it made sense to them.
[1513.74 → 1516.74] A massive stone was rolled away.
[1516.74 → 1518.74] The guards who had been posted are gone.
[1518.74 → 1519.74] The seal has been broken.
[1519.74 → 1521.74] A missing body.
[1521.74 → 1525.74] A pile of grave wrappings folded in a pile.
[1525.74 → 1526.74] Left behind.
[1526.74 → 1527.74] Right?
[1527.74 → 1530.74] People don't just wander from their graves.
[1530.74 → 1533.74] The empty tomb needs an explanation.
[1533.74 → 1535.74] But no explanation seems possible.
[1535.74 → 1538.74] And it was the same with the men.
[1538.74 → 1539.74] It wasn't just the women.
[1539.74 → 1540.74] Right?
[1540.74 → 1543.74] After the women hear the message from the angels, the angels told them,
[1543.74 → 1544.74] He is not here.
[1544.74 → 1548.74] They run, and they tell the men what happened.
[1548.74 → 1550.74] And what do the men say?
[1550.74 → 1551.74] Where they're like, yeah, of course.
[1551.74 → 1553.74] You know, we knew that was going to happen.
[1553.74 → 1555.74] That's not what they said, is it?
[1555.74 → 1557.74] Look at verse 11 with me.
[1557.74 → 1561.74] But they did not believe the women.
[1561.74 → 1562.74] Why?
[1562.74 → 1565.74] Because their words seemed like nonsense.
[1565.74 → 1569.74] They thought these women were delusional.
[1569.74 → 1571.74] They are completely nuts.
[1571.74 → 1573.74] What are you talking about?
[1573.74 → 1578.74] And so what I want us to see is that all of these people, every single one of them,
[1578.74 → 1581.74] could not wrap their heads around this.
[1581.74 → 1582.74] They were confused.
[1582.74 → 1583.74] They were bewildered.
[1583.74 → 1586.74] They could not believe what they had heard.
[1586.74 → 1588.74] And do you know why?
[1588.74 → 1590.74] Why couldn't they believe it?
[1590.74 → 1591.74] And do you listen very carefully.
[1591.74 → 1596.74] Because in the first century, people stayed dead.
[1596.74 → 1597.74] Right?
[1597.74 → 1599.74] It's very clear in the text.
[1599.74 → 1603.74] People in the first century, like today, stayed dead.
[1603.74 → 1607.74] You know, we have made a lot of progress across the centuries.
[1607.74 → 1609.74] But death is not one of them.
[1609.74 → 1612.74] Death still happens at a rate of what?
[1612.74 → 1614.74] About one per person.
[1614.74 → 1615.74] Right?
[1615.74 → 1620.74] There is no progress when it comes to death.
[1620.74 → 1626.74] And I think sometimes we suffer from what C.S. Lewis calls chronological snobbery.
[1626.74 → 1630.74] Then that's where we say, you know, those people 2,000 years ago,
[1630.74 → 1634.74] they were so much more superstitious than we are.
[1634.74 → 1635.74] Right?
[1635.74 → 1638.74] They believed in supernatural things happening all the time.
[1638.74 → 1641.74] But we are modern people of science.
[1641.74 → 1644.74] We know the way the world works.
[1644.74 → 1646.74] But friends, that is not true.
[1646.74 → 1652.74] The ancient people probably understood death better than we do.
[1652.74 → 1654.74] Because they saw it up close.
[1654.74 → 1659.74] People typically died in their homes and their families took care of the bodies.
[1659.74 → 1661.74] Death was up close.
[1661.74 → 1662.74] It was personal.
[1662.74 → 1664.74] It was hands-on.
[1664.74 → 1667.74] Everyone knew, you don't come back from the dead.
[1667.74 → 1672.74] Bodies were not expected to rise again.
[1672.74 → 1678.74] And this is even true in the Greco-Roman context, which was full of mythologies.
[1678.74 → 1679.74] Right?
[1679.74 → 1686.74] One ancient Greek poet wrote a play in which he had Apollo, the god of truth and prophecy, say this.
[1686.74 → 1693.74] Once a man has died and the dust has soaked up his blood, there is no resurrection.
[1693.74 → 1695.74] Right?
[1695.74 → 1697.74] From the words of a mythological god.
[1697.74 → 1698.74] Right?
[1698.74 → 1707.74] When Paul spoke to the Athenians in Acts chapter 17, he is speaking to a group of epic and Stoic philosophers.
[1707.74 → 1709.74] They were curious about Paul's new teachings.
[1709.74 → 1713.74] They were tracking with him as he talked about the existence of God.
[1713.74 → 1723.74] But then he got to the resurrection of Jesus, and it says in verse 32, when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered.
[1723.74 → 1724.74] Right?
[1724.74 → 1732.74] In other words, they look at Paul, they look at one another, and then they're like, what in Zeus's name are you talking about?
[1732.74 → 1733.74] Resurrection?
[1733.74 → 1736.74] We lost you at that point.
[1736.74 → 1748.74] Right now, of course, the Jews believed in the resurrection, but this resurrection would come at the end of days when all people, everybody would rise at the final judgment.
[1748.74 → 1754.74] But before that day, no Jew expected a resurrection in the middle of history.
[1754.74 → 1758.74] So the resurrection is not a story anybody would believe.
[1758.74 → 1764.74] Not the Greeks, the Gentiles of the Roman period, not the Jews themselves.
[1764.74 → 1772.74] And the reason why Luke, the writer of the Gospel that we just read, our passage, why he recounts all of these little details, right?
[1772.74 → 1781.74] Describing exactly who the women were, their names, the details of the event, and why Paul later tells us that over 500 people witnessed the risen Christ,
[1781.74 → 1788.74] is because they insisted that despite all expectations, this actually happened.
[1788.74 → 1796.74] It's like they're reaching out to us today, across time, and they're saying, look, we were just as doubtful.
[1796.74 → 1798.74] We were just as skeptical.
[1798.74 → 1802.74] We don't believe in resurrections.
[1802.74 → 1809.74] And despite all of our doubts, despite all of our skepticism, it happened.
[1809.74 → 1811.74] Jesus rose from the dead.
[1811.74 → 1812.74] Right?
[1812.74 → 1822.74] And so this first Easter arises from the ashes of a gory crucifixion, of crushed hopes, and of grieving hearts.
[1822.74 → 1825.74] Why am I making a big deal about this?
[1825.74 → 1832.74] Because there are many inspirational people of the past that are worth our admiring.
[1832.74 → 1840.74] You know, people have done great things, and we still, they still inspire us today.
[1840.74 → 1844.74] But you certainly do not make those people the centre of your lives.
[1844.74 → 1845.74] Right?
[1845.74 → 1847.74] I mean, I admire C.S. Lewis.
[1847.74 → 1848.74] Right?
[1848.74 → 1851.74] I enjoy his books.
[1851.74 → 1854.74] I learned a lot from him about the Christian faith.
[1854.74 → 1857.74] But I do not live for C.S. Lewis.
[1857.74 → 1860.74] I do not make C.S. Lewis the centre of my life.
[1860.74 → 1861.74] Right?
[1861.74 → 1868.74] And yet, if it is true that Jesus really walked out of the grave, it means that you do make him the centre of your life.
[1868.74 → 1869.74] Right?
[1869.74 → 1871.74] You cannot just set him aside.
[1871.74 → 1874.74] You can't just pick and choose from his teachings.
[1874.74 → 1878.74] You can't make him one inspirational figure out of many.
[1878.74 → 1883.74] You can't make him anything but the very centre of your life.
[1883.74 → 1884.74] Right?
[1884.74 → 1894.74] Because a person who rises from the grave and shows total power over death is a person who has proven that he is God.
[1894.74 → 1897.74] And you have to respond to that.
[1897.74 → 1899.74] And so that's why it comes down to this.
[1899.74 → 1901.74] Did the resurrection really happen?
[1901.74 → 1903.74] Yes or no?
[1903.74 → 1906.74] And billions of people around the world.
[1906.74 → 1916.74] In that day, all of a sudden, a movement of Jewish people who would never have thought about resurrection suddenly were proclaiming the risen Christ around the world.
[1916.74 → 1922.74] And since that time, billions of people around the world today throughout history believe that it did happen.
[1922.74 → 1928.74] And based on this historical fact, some people have given their lives.
[1928.74 → 1937.74] Some people right now on this very Easter Sunday are riding in a jail cell because they believe this.
[1937.74 → 1940.74] Some people have suffered pain.
[1940.74 → 1942.74] They have given away everything.
[1942.74 → 1944.74] They have moved across oceans.
[1944.74 → 1947.74] They have been banished from their own families.
[1947.74 → 1949.74] Why would anyone do that?
[1949.74 → 1962.74] Not for some inspirational example of love or a good path to walk, but because a man walked out of the grave.
[1962.74 → 1966.74] So that's the first thing we see that resurrection has happened.
[1966.74 → 1968.74] Now let's turn to think about today.
[1968.74 → 1971.74] Resurrection is still happening, friends.
[1971.74 → 1973.74] Resurrection is still happening.
[1973.74 → 1974.74] Now what do I mean by that?
[1974.74 → 1975.74] Two things.
[1975.74 → 1979.74] First, Jesus has risen from the dead.
[1979.74 → 1982.74] And because that is true, he is alive.
[1982.74 → 1985.74] Because he is alive, he is alive right now.
[1985.74 → 1994.74] And in the lives of men and women, boys and girls, bringing about resurrection power in our own lives and in the world.
[1994.74 → 1996.74] In our own lives and the world.
[1996.74 → 1997.74] So first, look at verse 7 with me.
[1997.74 → 2001.74] Verse 7 with me.
[2001.74 → 2004.74] The son of man, this is the angels telling the women.
[2004.74 → 2014.74] The son of man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified, and on the third day be raised again.
[2014.74 → 2018.74] Now look at that word, must.
[2018.74 → 2019.74] Right?
[2019.74 → 2020.74] Isn't that striking?
[2020.74 → 2024.74] He must be delivered over the hands of sinners.
[2024.74 → 2025.74] Right?
[2025.74 → 2028.74] The angels is saying that Jesus didn't accidentally die.
[2028.74 → 2029.74] Right?
[2029.74 → 2034.74] He didn't die a tragic death and where God was like, oh no, my plan is almost messed up.
[2034.74 → 2036.74] We're going to fix that with some resurrection.
[2036.74 → 2037.74] Now we're back on track.
[2037.74 → 2038.74] Right?
[2038.74 → 2039.74] No.
[2039.74 → 2040.74] Death was the plan.
[2040.74 → 2043.74] He must die.
[2043.74 → 2046.74] The cross was the mission of God.
[2046.74 → 2053.74] He died in our place to take the judgment for our sins upon himself.
[2053.74 → 2068.74] He died to defeat evil, to forgive sin, to roll back the power of death, and then to rise from the dead and open up a way for resurrection life for anyone and everyone who believes in him.
[2068.74 → 2073.74] And this is why the apostle Peter says in 1 Peter 1, verse 3, he says,
[2073.74 → 2080.74] In his great mercy has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[2080.74 → 2082.74] Friends, a living hope.
[2082.74 → 2084.74] A living hope.
[2084.74 → 2092.74] I love the way also Charles Wesley puts it in that great Easter hymn that we sang, our first song today.
[2092.74 → 2093.74] This is what he says.
[2093.74 → 2098.74] Love's redeeming work is done, fought the fight.
[2098.74 → 2099.74] The battle won.
[2099.74 → 2100.74] Right?
[2100.74 → 2111.08] Jesus has risen, and because of that, you and I can say to God right now, we can say to him, here is my guilt.
[2112.28 → 2115.28] We can come before him and say, here is my shame.
[2116.20 → 2117.76] Here is my brokenness.
[2118.96 → 2120.10] Here is my fear.
[2121.68 → 2122.82] Here is my sin.
[2124.24 → 2125.74] Would you please make it whole?
[2125.74 → 2129.74] Would you bring life into me today?
[2131.74 → 2133.08] Have you done that?
[2135.38 → 2138.08] And if we do that, he will.
[2138.84 → 2140.52] He will make you whole.
[2140.70 → 2142.04] That is the promise of Easter.
[2142.16 → 2145.56] The power of resurrection is available to you even today.
[2146.94 → 2152.50] And not only that, but Jesus is also bringing resurrection to the entire world.
[2153.20 → 2154.50] Look again at verse 1.
[2157.24 → 2159.32] This is actually an amazing verse.
[2159.32 → 2162.78] And it is really easy to read it and miss the significance of it.
[2163.54 → 2168.14] On the first day of the week, very early in the morning.
[2169.40 → 2172.30] Now this isn't just some throwaway comment from Luke.
[2172.40 → 2178.42] I mean, Luke is a brilliant writer, and he does not do throwaway descriptions like this.
[2178.42 → 2184.58] And what Luke is showing us is that Easter morning is not just about one man rising from the dead.
[2185.12 → 2193.06] But right here in the middle of a graveyard, in the middle of a graveyard, God is beginning a new work of creation.
[2194.06 → 2197.40] God is resurrecting all creation from the dead.
[2197.82 → 2200.20] He's bringing about a new heaven and a new earth.
[2200.20 → 2202.96] He is going to one day renew all things.
[2203.08 → 2210.54] And it begins with the resurrection of Jesus, who is the first fruits of the resurrection, as Paul told us in 1 Corinthians 15.
[2211.76 → 2213.40] The first fruits of the resurrection.
[2214.42 → 2219.00] So friends, there's a story about the cellist of Sarajevo.
[2219.14 → 2219.94] Have you heard that story?
[2220.40 → 2221.20] I don't know if any of you have heard that.
[2221.26 → 2222.38] The cellist of Sarajevo.
[2222.38 → 2235.24] It happened during the siege of Sarajevo in Bosnia, which is one of the most violent acts of a government against its own people in modern history.
[2236.32 → 2245.96] And during the siege in 1992, there was a cellist from the Sarajevo Symphony named Madrid Slavic.
[2246.58 → 2247.48] I'm sure I'm saying that wrong.
[2247.48 → 2255.40] And so what he did is he took his cello and he walked out into the midst of the bombing.
[2256.24 → 2260.98] He walked out into the midst of the ruins, into the midst of the sniper fire.
[2261.66 → 2272.30] And he sat in a ruined building, and he played his cello every day for 22 days to commemorate 22 people who were killed while lining up to buy bread.
[2272.30 → 2277.60] And he played the most magnificent music, the most beautiful music.
[2278.00 → 2280.16] He played the best he could.
[2281.16 → 2283.22] And people told him he was crazy.
[2284.06 → 2284.64] Clearly.
[2286.04 → 2288.20] But it inspired a nation.
[2288.90 → 2290.32] It inspired a movie and a book.
[2291.70 → 2292.26] Why?
[2293.72 → 2300.32] Because he was acting in protest against the violence and the brokenness of the world.
[2300.32 → 2302.38] And he became a sign of hope.
[2304.08 → 2306.04] Playing beautiful music in a graveyard.
[2306.36 → 2307.38] It was a sign of hope.
[2307.86 → 2311.38] A sing of hope that one day music will play again in Sarajevo.
[2312.00 → 2315.90] One day a city and a people will find wholeness again.
[2316.02 → 2318.36] That resurrection and life will come again.
[2319.10 → 2321.10] He was playing in a graveyard, friends.
[2321.10 → 2326.12] And we live in a graveyard in this world.
[2327.08 → 2327.22] Right?
[2327.34 → 2330.54] Think about since last Easter, all that's happened.
[2331.40 → 2332.94] More COVID outbreaks.
[2333.58 → 2336.68] Some of the most, the worst refugee crises in history.
[2337.52 → 2338.58] War is happening.
[2338.74 → 2341.42] Not only that, think about the loved ones we have lost.
[2343.74 → 2345.24] Families that have fallen apart.
[2346.18 → 2347.72] People racked with pain.
[2347.72 → 2350.68] And yet, here we are.
[2351.54 → 2352.06] Right?
[2352.22 → 2354.46] Here we are again on Easter morning.
[2354.82 → 2356.24] What are we doing here?
[2356.94 → 2357.86] Are we crazy?
[2358.62 → 2358.82] Right?
[2358.88 → 2360.04] Are we delusional?
[2361.10 → 2362.96] Are we in denial?
[2364.06 → 2365.14] What are we doing?
[2366.22 → 2367.52] I'll tell you what we're doing.
[2367.62 → 2369.64] We are playing music in the ruins.
[2370.04 → 2371.26] That is what we are doing.
[2371.26 → 2380.94] We are here today in this church, in the midst of a world that is falling apart as a sign of hope.
[2381.76 → 2382.76] That's what it is.
[2383.12 → 2386.38] That this world, we're saying, will not end in a graveyard.
[2387.70 → 2394.10] The darkness that we see in this world, in our lives, is not the darkness we see right before the sun sets.
[2394.22 → 2397.44] It is the darkness we see right before the sunrise.
[2397.74 → 2397.94] Right?
[2398.06 → 2398.98] I think that's what this says.
[2399.32 → 2400.40] Morning has broken.
[2400.40 → 2402.42] Morning has broken.
[2402.96 → 2406.80] Very early in the morning, they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
[2408.38 → 2416.28] Friends, the resurrection of Jesus is a sign and a promise and a preview of the resurrection that will come to all the earth.
[2416.28 → 2424.76] When death is banished and tears are wiped away and injustice will be made right, and all sicknesses will be healed.
[2425.48 → 2426.70] Relationships will be restored.
[2427.08 → 2432.84] We ourselves will be free of the ravishes of sin and sickness.
[2432.84 → 2434.24] And we will be made whole.
[2434.24 → 2437.68] And we will be made whole and everything in God's good creation will be made new.
[2438.48 → 2439.52] Friends, that is a resurrection.
[2440.56 → 2441.74] Because Christ is risen.
[2443.74 → 2444.60] One more time.
[2444.90 → 2445.60] Christ is risen.
[2446.04 → 2446.80] Christ is risen.
[2447.26 → 2447.98] Let's pray.
[2447.98 → 2455.34] Almighty God, you have conquered sin and death, and you rose victorious.
[2456.54 → 2459.38] And it is the heartfelt cry of our hearts.
[2459.38 → 2461.58] It is the foundation of our faith.
[2461.58 → 2468.10] The anchor of our lives to be able to say that we, in Christ, have risen as well.
[2468.10 → 2477.26] That we can find a power that causes us to burst forth from our tombs to newness of life.
[2478.34 → 2484.80] I pray, Lord, that if there are any here today who have not yet known this resurrection power of Jesus in their own lives,
[2485.30 → 2489.54] that by the working of your spirit you would cause them to be born again to a living hope
[2489.54 → 2492.48] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[2492.48 → 2499.56] And for all of us, would you help us to be people of hope, playing music in the ruins of the world,
[2500.30 → 2503.28] believing that a day is coming when all things will be made right.
[2503.90 → 2505.80] We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[2506.54 → 2506.86] Amen.
[2508.40 → 2512.02] Let's all stand together and let's sing our song of response.
[2522.48 → 2549.08] Let's sing our song of response.
[2549.08 → 2559.08] The people of the risen King who delight to bring Him praise,
[2559.08 → 2569.02] Come all that tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of praise.
[2569.02 → 2579.02] From the shimmy shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to Him,
[2579.02 → 2589.02] Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[2589.02 → 2599.02] Rejoice! Rejoice! May every come, rejoice!
[2599.02 → 2610.02] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[2610.02 → 2622.02] Come those whose joy is born in sun, And those weeping through the night.
[2622.02 → 2632.02] Come those who tell of the times won, And they're struggling in the fight.
[2632.02 → 2642.02] For His perfect love will never change, And His mercies never cease.
[2642.02 → 2652.02] But follow us through all our days With a certain hope of peace.
[2652.02 → 2662.02] Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every come, rejoice!
[2662.02 → 2673.02] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!
[2673.02 → 2685.02] Come young and old from every land, And women of their faith.
[2685.02 → 2695.02] Come those with full and empty hands, Find their riches of His grace.
[2695.02 → 2700.02] Come those with full and empty hands, And all the world His people sing,
[2700.02 → 2705.02] Sure to show, we'll hear them call.
[2705.02 → 2715.02] The truth that cries through every age, And God is all in all.
[2715.02 → 2725.02] Rejoice! Rejoice! Let every come, rejoice!
[2725.02 → 2735.02] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ, rejoice!
