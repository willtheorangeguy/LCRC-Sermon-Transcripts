• What sacrifice are we not willing to make?
• Living as a sacrifice of worship to God
• Three things to give up:
	+ Sexual immorality or impurity
	+ Greed
	+ Idolatry (tolerating these behaviors)
• The rejection of God's plan for our lives can lead us to fill the void with other things, such as sex.
• Sex is a good gift from God, but it becomes immoral when used to replace God in our lives.
• Idolatry occurs when we elevate something, like sex, to the place of God and put our hope in it for fulfillment.
• When this happens, what we idolize fails to satisfy us, leading to disappointment and ultimately treating it as meaningless.
• This pattern is seen in all forms of idolatry, resulting in broken relationships with God and others.
• We are called to be light in the Lord, not just people who have been saved from darkness, but actively living as children of light.
• New identity in Christ changes lifestyle
• Living as children of light means bearing fruit (goodness, righteousness, and truth)
• Find out what pleases the Lord and bring it to him for delight
• Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness but expose them by offering a different image
