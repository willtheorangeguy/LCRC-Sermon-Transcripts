• Two key points about prayer from Jesus: having a Heavenly Father who sees and knows what you need, changing everything about prayer.
• Hypocrisy in prayer is a problem when people focus on being seen by others rather than God
• The desire to be seen and noticed can lead people to pretend or fake their piety
• This is not just a problem of the past, but also present day, as many people still seek recognition and attention from others
• Jesus teaches that true prayer is about being seen and accepted by God, not by others
• He invites believers to come before Him freely and dwell with Him in secret
• To resist hypocritical prayers, it's essential to be honest and genuine in one's approach to God
• This means being oneself in prayer, without pretending or trying to imitate others.
• Jesus teaches that prayer should be authentic and personal, praying as oneself rather than pretending to be someone else
• The danger of hypocritical prayer can be avoided by praying in private, but not exclusively; public and group prayer are also encouraged
• God is a father who sees and knows each person personally, making it possible for them to come before him in prayer
• Jesus warns against "babbling" or repetitive prayer that attempts to get God's attention through volume of words
• This approach misunderstands God as being distant and requiring ritualistic phrases or repetition to answer prayers
• Praying doesn't inform God of needs he's unaware of
• Prayer is a means to arouse oneself to seek God and trust in his care
• Babbling prayer can be avoided by having a correct view of God as a good father who hears us
• Short, simple prayers are often more effective than lengthy ones
• The importance of approaching the Lord's Prayer as a foundation for Christian prayer, rather than just repeating it mindlessly
• The Lord's Prayer as an ordering of the world that gives categories for thinking and serving as a guide for life of prayer
