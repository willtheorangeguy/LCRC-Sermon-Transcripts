[1132.60 --> 1133.02]  Emmanuel
[1133.02 --> 1140.52]  A child prays
[1140.52 --> 1142.44]  For peace on earth
[1142.44 --> 1144.54]  And she's calling out
[1144.54 --> 1147.02]  The seed of heaven
[1147.02 --> 1147.60]  O God
[1147.60 --> 1148.60]  O God

[1183.14 --> 1213.12]  Glory to the light of the world.
[1213.14 --> 1216.74]  Prince of Peace has come.

[1242.14 --> 1251.46]  Glory to the light of the world.
[1251.46 --> 1259.66]  Glory to the light of the world.
[1259.66 --> 1266.98]  The world waits for a miracle.
[1266.98 --> 1271.70]  Heart longs for a little bit of hope.
[1271.70 --> 1277.30]  Oh God, oh God, oh God, Emmanuel.
[1277.30 --> 1292.68]  Thank you, Ashley and Paul.
[1292.68 --> 1295.46]  It's always great to learn a new song, especially this time of year.
[1297.48 --> 1299.88]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1299.88 --> 1309.42]  O promised Christ, we are a world at war.
[1309.42 --> 1312.96]  Our peace depends on your coming.
[1312.96 --> 1315.08]  We are a sinful people.
[1315.08 --> 1318.22]  Our pardon depends on your coming.
[1318.22 --> 1323.20]  We are full of good intentions, but weak at keeping promises.
[1323.20 --> 1329.52]  Our only hope of doing God's will is that you should come and help us do it.
[1329.52 --> 1337.76]  Lord Christ, word made flesh, our world waits for your peace, for your pardon, and for your
[1337.76 --> 1339.16]  grace.
[1339.16 --> 1342.80]  Even so, come, Lord Jesus, amen.
[1342.80 --> 1349.66]  Of course, our hope is that coupled with confession is pardon, and we're reminded of that this
[1349.66 --> 1354.40]  morning in these words, taken from Jeremiah 33.
[1354.40 --> 1355.94]  We are full of God.
[1355.94 --> 1362.62]  Jesus Christ, our Lord, whose coming we announce in this season is our righteousness.
[1362.62 --> 1365.64]  In Christ, we are made right with God.
[1365.64 --> 1367.64]  Thanks be to God.
[1367.64 --> 1373.78]  Lord, I Need You is our next song, after which all those involved in kids' life are free to
[1373.78 --> 1374.78]  go.
[1374.78 --> 1375.78]  Here we go.
[1375.78 --> 1376.78]  Here we go.
[1376.78 --> 1380.78]  Here we go.
[1380.78 --> 1389.78]  Lord, I come.
[1389.78 --> 1393.78]  I confess.
[1393.78 --> 1394.78]  I confess.
[1394.78 --> 1395.78]  I confess.
[1395.78 --> 1400.78]  Vowing here, I find my rest.
[1400.78 --> 1406.78]  Without you, I fall apart.
[1406.78 --> 1416.78]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[1416.78 --> 1417.78]  Lord, I need you.
[1417.78 --> 1418.78]  Lord, I need you.
[1418.78 --> 1423.78]  Oh, I need you.
[1423.78 --> 1428.78]  Every hour, I need you.
[1428.78 --> 1433.78]  My wonderful face, my righteousness.
[1433.78 --> 1443.78]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1443.78 --> 1444.78]  Your grace is born.
[1444.78 --> 1445.78]  Your grace is found.
[1445.78 --> 1450.78]  Your grace is found.
[1450.78 --> 1454.78]  Is where you are.
[1454.78 --> 1457.78]  And there you are.
[1457.78 --> 1461.78]  Lord, I am free.
[1461.78 --> 1468.78]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1468.78 --> 1473.74]  Your heart, Lord, I am free.
[1474.54 --> 1480.68]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1483.42 --> 1485.92]  Lord, I need you.
[1486.18 --> 1490.04]  Oh, I need you.
[1490.04 --> 1496.04]  Every hour I need you.
[1496.04 --> 1501.42]  My undefense, my righteousness.
[1502.46 --> 1506.60]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1510.90 --> 1515.00]  So teach me song to rise to you.
[1516.60 --> 1520.88]  When temptation comes my way.
[1522.22 --> 1525.82]  When I cannot stand, I fall on you.
[1526.04 --> 1532.42]  Jesus, hold my hope and stay.
[1533.56 --> 1537.60]  When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[1539.36 --> 1543.42]  Jesus, hold my hope and stay.
[1543.42 --> 1549.80]  Lord, I need you.
[1549.80 --> 1553.90]  Oh, I need you.
[1553.90 --> 1559.78]  Every hour I need you.
[1560.28 --> 1565.52]  My wantiness, my righteousness.
[1566.52 --> 1570.88]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1570.88 --> 1577.88]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1577.88 --> 1584.26]  Every hour I need you.
[1584.26 --> 1589.26]  My wantiness, my righteousness.
[1589.26 --> 1595.64]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1595.64 --> 1603.04]  My wantiness, my righteousness.
[1603.04 --> 1609.42]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1609.42 --> 1611.66]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1611.66 --> 1623.22]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1623.22 --> 1629.36]  So the Chinese ministry, brothers and sisters,
[1629.36 --> 1634.88]  you're also welcome to go and have your sermon in Mandarin.
[1634.88 --> 1655.44]  All right.
[1655.44 --> 1661.56]  So we are continuing an Advent series that we began last Sunday,
[1661.56 --> 1665.92]  and the title of the series is The Mothers of Jesus.
[1665.92 --> 1674.00]  So in your New Testaments, right, the first book of the New Testament is Matthew,
[1674.00 --> 1680.20]  and the first chapter of Matthew is a genealogy or the first section.
[1680.20 --> 1685.64]  It opens with a genealogy that is the ancestral line that leads from Abraham
[1685.64 --> 1690.64]  down to Joseph and Mary in the birth of Jesus.
[1690.64 --> 1697.76]  And we're looking at the five women who are named in the genealogy of Jesus.
[1697.76 --> 1702.68]  And it's surprising that there are women at all.
[1702.68 --> 1707.08]  Women weren't enlisted in the genealogies of that time.
[1707.08 --> 1711.76]  But not only that, but all four of the women before we get to Mary,
[1711.76 --> 1715.72]  so we have Tamar and Rahab, Ruth and Bathsheba,
[1715.72 --> 1721.48]  all four of them have something else interesting in common,
[1721.48 --> 1725.40]  which is that none of them are Israelites.
[1725.40 --> 1729.32]  So not only are they outsiders as women,
[1729.32 --> 1735.08]  but they are also outsiders ethnically as God's people,
[1735.08 --> 1737.24]  outsiders to God's people.
[1737.24 --> 1739.32]  And so this is really good news, right?
[1739.32 --> 1740.68]  This is good news for us.
[1740.68 --> 1742.60]  This is good news for the world.
[1742.60 --> 1749.16]  It's good news that whoever you are, the welcome is wide open
[1749.16 --> 1753.24]  into the family of Jesus by his grace.
[1753.24 --> 1757.72]  So we're looking today at the second woman who is named in Jesus's family tree,
[1757.72 --> 1759.32]  and that is Rahab.
[1759.32 --> 1765.64]  So I want to invite you to open your Bibles first to Matthew chapter one.
[1765.64 --> 1771.64]  And so in your brown pew Bibles, that is on page 717.
[1772.20 --> 1774.20]  A 717.
[1774.20 --> 1776.92]  That is Matthew chapter one.
[1776.92 --> 1783.00]  And we'll read part of the genealogy verses one through five page 717.
[1783.00 --> 1785.32]  So I will just read it from the screen.
[1785.32 --> 1789.00]  Your pew Bibles are maybe slightly different.
[1789.00 --> 1795.32]  They're from published in 1984, whereas the one we have on the screen was published in 2011.
[1795.80 --> 1799.40]  Once in a while, some words are a little bit different, but it's essentially very, very,
[1800.04 --> 1801.56]  like very much the same.
[1801.56 --> 1803.96]  So you ought to be able to follow along as well in your pew Bible.
[1804.92 --> 1805.56]  Okay.
[1805.56 --> 1809.40]  So please give your attention to the reading of God's word.
[1809.40 --> 1810.04]  Here's the passage.
[1810.04 --> 1816.44]  This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1817.40 --> 1819.32]  Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[1820.12 --> 1821.64]  Isaac, the father of Jacob.
[1822.52 --> 1825.64]  Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[1826.76 --> 1831.88]  Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar.
[1833.72 --> 1835.64]  Perez, the father of Hezron.
[1836.20 --> 1837.72]  Hezron, the father of Ram.
[1837.72 --> 1841.96]  Ram, the father of Aminadab.
[1842.36 --> 1845.24]  And Aminadab, the father of Nashon.
[1845.72 --> 1847.96]  Nashon, the father of Salmon.
[1848.52 --> 1853.32]  Salmon, the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.
[1854.76 --> 1857.40]  So now let's turn to Joshua chapter 2.
[1857.88 --> 1860.20]  And that is back in your Old Testaments.
[1860.76 --> 1864.44]  And that's on page 158, 158.
[1865.32 --> 1868.52]  And if you want to have that in front of you, Joshua chapter 2.
[1868.76 --> 1871.64]  We will be reading verses 1 through 16.
[1872.44 --> 1873.80]  Page 158.
[1873.96 --> 1877.56]  Joshua 2, verses 1 through 16.
[1877.56 --> 1884.52]  Then Joshua, son of Nun, secretly sent two spies from Shittim.
[1885.16 --> 1889.08]  Go look over the land, he said, especially Jericho.
[1889.64 --> 1894.50]  So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
[1895.08 --> 1902.48]  The king of Jericho was told, look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.
[1902.48 --> 1907.52]  So the king of Jericho sent his message to Rahab.
[1908.00 --> 1914.16]  Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.
[1914.80 --> 1918.08]  But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them.
[1918.56 --> 1922.74]  She said, yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
[1923.46 --> 1927.18]  At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left.
[1927.18 --> 1929.54]  I don't know which way they went.
[1929.82 --> 1930.84]  Go after them quickly.
[1931.32 --> 1932.44]  You may catch up with them.
[1933.38 --> 1940.26]  But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.
[1941.68 --> 1947.36]  So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan.
[1947.94 --> 1951.48]  And as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
[1951.48 --> 1957.24]  But before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof and said to them,
[1957.76 --> 1962.70]  I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us,
[1962.82 --> 1967.16]  so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.
[1967.86 --> 1973.50]  We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt
[1973.50 --> 1981.10]  and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Emirates east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.
[1982.16 --> 1987.28]  When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you.
[1987.62 --> 1992.10]  For the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.
[1992.10 --> 2002.04]  Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you.
[2002.72 --> 2010.82]  Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them,
[2011.48 --> 2013.38]  and that you will save us from death.
[2014.34 --> 2016.96]  Our lives for your lives, the men assured her.
[2016.96 --> 2024.08]  If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.
[2025.46 --> 2031.10]  So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.
[2031.80 --> 2035.90]  She said to them, go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you.
[2036.72 --> 2043.62]  Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.
[2044.62 --> 2045.96]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2046.96 --> 2047.66]  Thanks be to God.
[2048.40 --> 2049.66]  Would you please join me in prayer?
[2052.98 --> 2061.04]  Heavenly Father, Lord God, we praise you that you have come and you have visited us once in the person of Jesus.
[2061.60 --> 2069.08]  And you will come and visit us again to bring shalom, to bring healing for all of creation.
[2069.08 --> 2076.68]  And we pray now that you would come to us by your Holy Spirit in your word,
[2076.90 --> 2082.02]  so that we might respond to your word of grace with obedience and love.
[2082.52 --> 2084.68]  We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2084.68 --> 2094.06]  Now the trouble with being an American, living in Canada, is trying to figure out when to celebrate Thanksgiving.
[2094.06 --> 2094.12]  Thanksgiving.
[2096.76 --> 2103.98]  So here in Canada, it's October 10, and in the U.S., it's November 24.
[2104.38 --> 2105.46]  Quite a difference.
[2105.82 --> 2106.84]  Most holidays are shared.
[2106.94 --> 2107.62]  Christmas is Christmas.
[2107.76 --> 2108.32]  Easter is Easter.
[2108.60 --> 2108.96]  Thanksgiving.
[2108.96 --> 2109.96]  Thanksgiving.
[2109.96 --> 2110.80]  October, November.
[2110.80 --> 2117.98]  And so what happens to us almost every year is we completely miss Canadian Thanksgiving because we're just not used to it.
[2118.04 --> 2119.18]  It sneaks up so early.
[2120.12 --> 2121.68]  You know, we're like, school just gets started.
[2121.80 --> 2123.24]  And Thanksgiving, we're not used to that.
[2123.66 --> 2126.48]  So Thanksgiving, Canadian Thanksgiving comes and goes.
[2126.90 --> 2128.78]  And our kids are protesting.
[2129.10 --> 2130.04]  We need to celebrate Thanksgiving.
[2130.04 --> 2132.24]  So we say, okay, we'll celebrate American Thanksgiving.
[2133.26 --> 2135.64]  But the culture doesn't support that.
[2135.86 --> 2140.42]  And so American Thanksgiving comes and goes because it's Thursday.
[2140.68 --> 2142.30]  No one has, you know, Friday off.
[2142.38 --> 2145.26]  And we are busy, and so Thanksgiving passes.
[2146.14 --> 2150.00]  But I had bought in a frozen turkey, and I had defrosted it in the fridge.
[2150.32 --> 2152.52]  So last Sunday, I get home from church.
[2153.06 --> 2159.72]  It's like 2 p.m., and I decide I better cook that defrosted turkey that's sitting in my fridge.
[2160.48 --> 2162.48]  So at 2 p.m., I start cooking the turkey.
[2162.74 --> 2163.34]  It's a big turkey.
[2164.26 --> 2171.32]  At 5.30, I decide I really ought to invite someone over to help me eat this turkey.
[2172.36 --> 2177.52]  And so kind of thinking through all of the possibilities of who possibly could maybe respond at the very last minute,
[2177.96 --> 2180.90]  we end up inviting some family friends who live down the street.
[2181.34 --> 2187.24]  And so they came over, and we had a very nice Thanksgiving celebration.
[2187.24 --> 2199.12]  And so, yeah, it turned out to be a wonderful Thanksgiving because of that welcoming people into your home.
[2199.80 --> 2200.02]  Right?
[2200.02 --> 2207.90]  I really think that it's that sharing a meal of welcoming people into your home is what makes the holidays so special.
[2207.90 --> 2216.50]  And as we all approach this holiday season and Christmas, I know many of us will be sharing meals with family and friends.
[2216.50 --> 2225.20]  You know, there is something delightful and beautiful that hospitality is at the heart of this season.
[2225.70 --> 2231.60]  And it's because, in many ways, hospitality is at the center of the gospel.
[2231.60 --> 2237.60]  And it is certainly at the center of this story of Rahab.
[2238.48 --> 2246.74]  So I want to look at this story together, the story of this amazing woman, Rahab, through the lens of hospitality.
[2248.02 --> 2250.32]  And just two simple things today.
[2250.96 --> 2253.64]  First, we're going to look at the hospitality of Rahab.
[2254.30 --> 2257.22]  And then we're going to look at the hospitality of God.
[2257.22 --> 2261.84]  Okay, so first, let's look at the hospitality of Rahab.
[2262.74 --> 2266.22]  And so we meet Rahab in Joshua chapter 2.
[2267.18 --> 2269.06]  Verse 1, let's look at verse 1 again.
[2269.16 --> 2269.76]  It says this,
[2270.08 --> 2274.32]  Then Joshua, son of Nun, secretly sent two spies from Shittim.
[2275.30 --> 2278.98]  Go look over the land, he said, especially Jericho.
[2279.94 --> 2282.34]  So here's a little bit of background to this story.
[2282.34 --> 2286.30]  God's people had finally come through the wilderness.
[2287.36 --> 2297.54]  And they're beginning to be prepared by Joshua to come into the promised land and conquer Canaan that God had promised to them.
[2297.98 --> 2306.42]  And the only thing that's really preventing them at this point from entering into the promised land is this great fortified city of Jericho.
[2307.20 --> 2309.70]  So Joshua sends two spies ahead.
[2309.70 --> 2313.40]  Now, God's people are camped in the Transjordan.
[2313.52 --> 2316.16]  So that's east of the Jordan River in Shittim.
[2316.64 --> 2321.62]  And he sends them west, across the Jordan, into the land of Canaan.
[2323.00 --> 2325.06]  So they're going to go and they're going to scout out the land.
[2325.18 --> 2331.36]  They come into the city and they're going in as spies to see what they can learn.
[2331.36 --> 2333.98]  So we continue in verse 1.
[2334.34 --> 2334.90]  And it says,
[2335.18 --> 2339.96]  So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
[2341.64 --> 2346.22]  So in the city of Jericho is a woman named Rahab.
[2347.10 --> 2349.28]  Rahab was a prostitute.
[2349.28 --> 2356.00]  And it says in Joshua 2 that Rahab's house was built into the wall of Jericho.
[2356.22 --> 2358.36]  Now, this was quite common in that day.
[2358.44 --> 2359.58]  It was a casement wall.
[2359.68 --> 2363.20]  And so there was actually apartment homes all in the wall.
[2363.20 --> 2373.44]  And in particular, it was common for the red light districts of the cities to be on the outskirts of the city.
[2374.08 --> 2384.24]  So what I think is interesting here is that the geography of Rahab's home also in some ways represents her social location.
[2384.24 --> 2390.76]  Because prostitutes back then, as they are today, really are at the bottom of the social ladder.
[2391.96 --> 2406.30]  Even in today's world, many, many women all over the world are forced into this situation and they must choose survival over safety because of the desperation of their situations.
[2407.62 --> 2408.64]  So this is Rahab.
[2409.28 --> 2411.68]  She is on the outskirts of the city.
[2411.68 --> 2417.42]  She is an outsider to society itself.
[2419.06 --> 2424.84]  And it says in verse 1 that the spies entered the house of the prostitute Rahab and stayed there.
[2424.92 --> 2427.74]  Now, you might be wondering, why did they go to that house?
[2428.58 --> 2431.02]  Well, it was not for immoral reasons.
[2431.72 --> 2437.56]  They probably thought if they lodged in the red light district of the city that they would go unnoticed.
[2438.56 --> 2440.92]  Unfortunately, they did get noticed.
[2440.92 --> 2444.78]  And the king gets tipped off that they are there.
[2444.98 --> 2448.72]  So he sends messengers to Rahab's house.
[2448.98 --> 2450.74]  So in verse 3, it says,
[2451.26 --> 2453.94]  So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab.
[2454.46 --> 2460.78]  Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house because they have come to spy out the whole land.
[2460.78 --> 2466.48]  Now, let's think about Rahab's situation here for a moment.
[2466.60 --> 2467.48]  Let's think about this.
[2469.40 --> 2478.18]  Here's this woman, probably desperate to get out of her situation and improve her life.
[2478.18 --> 2485.48]  She has an amazing opportunity that just landed right in front of her.
[2486.14 --> 2490.74]  She's got two of the king's enemies in her living room.
[2491.20 --> 2494.36]  All she has to do is turn them over.
[2495.38 --> 2496.96]  She'd likely get a reward.
[2497.38 --> 2498.30]  She might get some money.
[2498.42 --> 2500.28]  She might get the king's favor.
[2500.28 --> 2504.44]  She would be a hero of the people.
[2506.14 --> 2510.72]  This is probably the best opportunity Rahab is ever going to get.
[2511.98 --> 2517.14]  And on the other hand, if she refuses to turn them in, that likely would be her death sentence.
[2517.14 --> 2521.06]  The king knows that they are in her house.
[2521.06 --> 2528.22]  So this is really a complete no-brainer for Rahab to turn these two spies over to the king.
[2528.56 --> 2530.66]  It has every advantage for her.
[2531.48 --> 2535.28]  And of course, there are penalties and consequences for not doing so.
[2536.50 --> 2542.52]  But instead, in a shocking twist in this story, she doesn't turn them in.
[2543.72 --> 2547.66]  Instead, it says in verse 4 that she hides the men on the roof.
[2548.34 --> 2550.82]  And then she misdirects the king's messenger.
[2550.82 --> 2555.08]  She says, yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
[2555.58 --> 2558.36]  At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left.
[2558.78 --> 2560.00]  I don't know which way they went.
[2560.34 --> 2561.20]  Go after them quickly.
[2561.46 --> 2562.22]  You might catch them.
[2563.46 --> 2564.84]  She doesn't turn them over.
[2565.52 --> 2569.66]  Instead, she hides them and she deceives the king.
[2570.98 --> 2573.98]  Why on earth would she do that?
[2573.98 --> 2577.80]  Completely unexpected.
[2577.80 --> 2581.12]  Completely unthinkable.
[2582.32 --> 2582.38]  Right?
[2582.70 --> 2591.50]  Why does she lie to the king, who's probably kind of more of a tyrant kind of guy, a warlord in a sense of the city,
[2592.14 --> 2595.70]  lie to this guy, betray her own people,
[2595.70 --> 2602.92]  cut herself off from her own religion and culture to side with these foreigners,
[2603.92 --> 2608.26]  put herself in serious danger.
[2609.04 --> 2610.68]  Why does she do this?
[2611.54 --> 2614.92]  Well, it tells us right here in this passage in verses 9 to 11.
[2614.92 --> 2619.94]  It says she believes in the God of Israel.
[2622.00 --> 2626.08]  And many commentators have said about this, what she says,
[2626.16 --> 2630.90]  that it is one of the most beautiful confessions of faith in the Old Testament.
[2631.70 --> 2635.82]  She basically says, we heard about your God.
[2635.82 --> 2639.36]  We heard about all that he did.
[2640.14 --> 2642.84]  We heard about how you were slaves in Egypt.
[2643.36 --> 2647.80]  How your God rescued you from slavery and brought you through the Red Sea.
[2648.24 --> 2650.36]  And he brought down your oppressors.
[2651.42 --> 2654.40]  We heard about how your God led you through the wilderness.
[2654.76 --> 2657.06]  And how he fed you with manna.
[2658.08 --> 2663.22]  We heard about how when you came into the Jordan, you took down armies ten times your size.
[2663.22 --> 2664.22]  We heard about how you were slaves in Egypt.
[2664.22 --> 2665.22]  We heard about how you were slaves in Egypt.
[2665.22 --> 2666.22]  We heard about how you were slaves in Egypt.
[2666.22 --> 2670.64]  We heard about the wonderful works of your God who rescued you.
[2672.00 --> 2676.10]  And then she says, and I want to be rescued too.
[2677.38 --> 2679.62]  I want in.
[2680.24 --> 2681.68]  I want to be a part of this.
[2681.84 --> 2683.42]  I want to be rescued.
[2683.56 --> 2688.06]  I want to be part of this people of this God.
[2688.06 --> 2697.80]  So she forgoes the opportunity to rescue herself and puts her life in the hands of the God of Israel.
[2697.80 --> 2702.38]  Because she believes that he will rescue her.
[2703.92 --> 2707.64]  And friends, this is such a powerful lesson on faith for us.
[2707.94 --> 2709.94]  It shows us what faith really is.
[2711.02 --> 2714.90]  What does it mean to be a person of faith?
[2714.90 --> 2724.56]  You know, when you think in your mind of maybe someone you admire or respect as a person of faith, what comes to your mind?
[2724.68 --> 2731.74]  You know, maybe, perhaps, you would think of a good moral person with no sin in their stories.
[2733.34 --> 2740.34]  And likely the same person would be someone who has all the right answers about God.
[2740.34 --> 2743.30]  But look at Rahab.
[2744.32 --> 2745.96]  Does she have all the answers?
[2747.14 --> 2748.12]  Probably not.
[2749.06 --> 2751.44]  She doesn't know anything about the law of Moses.
[2751.94 --> 2759.12]  She barely knew anything about God other than these rumors that she had heard about these amazing things that God had done.
[2761.04 --> 2763.68]  Does she have a clean moral record?
[2765.76 --> 2766.28]  No.
[2767.00 --> 2768.02]  She's a prostitute.
[2768.02 --> 2768.62]  She's a prostitute.
[2770.24 --> 2772.68]  So then, what does it mean to be a person of faith?
[2773.52 --> 2776.12]  It's not to know the right stuff.
[2776.46 --> 2778.48]  To have all the answers about God.
[2779.86 --> 2782.54]  It's not to have a clean record.
[2783.66 --> 2785.80]  I hope you know that none of us does.
[2787.38 --> 2795.90]  To be a person of faith means to believe that God and God alone is the only one who can rescue you.
[2795.90 --> 2798.92]  So do you believe that?
[2800.18 --> 2802.26]  That's what it means to be a person of faith.
[2803.62 --> 2806.64]  But there's something else we learn about faith from Rahab in the story.
[2806.80 --> 2811.16]  You know, in Hebrews chapter 11, it's sometimes called the hall of faith.
[2811.74 --> 2816.76]  It gives us all these examples of men and women from the Old Testament who lived out these lives of faith.
[2817.32 --> 2818.52]  And who do we find there?
[2819.36 --> 2820.52]  But our sister Rahab.
[2820.52 --> 2823.66]  And it says of her in verse 31,
[2824.10 --> 2831.04]  By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
[2831.04 --> 2839.58]  And I love that the writer of Hebrews says that Rahab's faith was expressed in her hospitality.
[2840.04 --> 2842.14]  That she welcomed the spies.
[2843.00 --> 2851.10]  Because by doing so, she knew that she was, in welcoming them, that she was welcoming the God of Israel into her life.
[2851.10 --> 2854.30]  I welcome him as my king.
[2855.12 --> 2861.14]  Even though that means walking away from everything that she had ever known.
[2862.40 --> 2866.40]  And by the way, people are still doing this today.
[2867.22 --> 2870.76]  People around the world hear about Jesus Christ.
[2871.34 --> 2876.00]  And they live in countries where to follow Jesus and to believe in him, you're going to have to leave your family.
[2876.62 --> 2878.74]  And you're going to have to put your life at risk.
[2878.74 --> 2881.58]  And Rahab does that.
[2883.24 --> 2885.90]  And the New Testament sings her praises.
[2887.04 --> 2887.18]  Right?
[2887.24 --> 2891.88]  Not only do we read about her faith in the book of Hebrews, but also in the book of James.
[2892.80 --> 2894.80]  James chapter 2, verse 25.
[2895.88 --> 2896.76]  It says this,
[2896.76 --> 2906.58]  Was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?
[2906.58 --> 2907.08]  Right?
[2907.08 --> 2913.46]  James is a book in the New Testament that is very focused on faith.
[2914.12 --> 2916.10]  What is real faith?
[2916.90 --> 2920.98]  And it says that faith without works is what?
[2921.84 --> 2922.44]  Dead.
[2923.94 --> 2927.42]  He says faith must be shown by our works.
[2927.42 --> 2929.56]  And that's what Rahab does.
[2929.62 --> 2933.20]  And that's why she is commended here by James, by Hebrews.
[2933.34 --> 2936.62]  Because she demonstrates her faith with her actions.
[2937.54 --> 2937.84]  Right?
[2937.96 --> 2940.90]  So she hears about this God of Israel.
[2942.00 --> 2943.34]  The whole city had heard.
[2944.00 --> 2945.20]  But what does Rahab do?
[2945.20 --> 2947.42]  She believes.
[2948.18 --> 2957.62]  She says that he is the God of heaven above and the God of earth below.
[2958.84 --> 2962.98]  And then, not only does she hear about him and then believe that he is the true God,
[2962.98 --> 2966.42]  she then puts her whole life into his hands.
[2966.66 --> 2966.74]  Right?
[2966.94 --> 2970.24]  She welcomes him to be the God of her life.
[2970.24 --> 2975.30]  And friends, that is what the Christmas story is all about.
[2976.12 --> 2976.94]  God is coming.
[2978.38 --> 2978.60]  Right?
[2978.70 --> 2982.90]  God is coming to invade your world.
[2984.06 --> 2987.74]  He is coming to invade your life, your space.
[2988.34 --> 2989.52]  What are you going to do?
[2990.46 --> 2992.74]  How are you going to respond?
[2992.74 --> 2999.42]  Like Rahab, are you going to believe in this God as the only God who is worthy of your worship?
[3000.00 --> 3003.20]  And are you going to trust in this God as your only rescue?
[3004.50 --> 3009.02]  And then are you going to completely reorient your entire life around this God,
[3009.30 --> 3013.54]  even be willing to leave your former allegiances?
[3014.96 --> 3016.22]  That's what Rahab does.
[3016.64 --> 3021.02]  That's what everyone who encounters the true God does.
[3021.02 --> 3032.32]  So I heard this story about a pub owner who lived in the outskirts of London in the early 1980s.
[3032.86 --> 3039.68]  And so in the early 1980s in London, a big snowstorm hit in December of 1981.
[3039.84 --> 3040.62]  This is a true story.
[3041.56 --> 3045.48]  And inside this little pub, there was a knock on the door.
[3046.46 --> 3049.88]  And the pub owner was, you know, why is there a knock on the door?
[3049.88 --> 3051.88]  Or there's a blizzard outside.
[3052.78 --> 3055.98]  And look, there is a car stranded right in front of the pub.
[3057.24 --> 3062.12]  And the driver is there now standing there at the door, knocking on the door.
[3062.70 --> 3067.44]  The pub owner opens the door and says, and the driver says, sir, can we rent a room?
[3068.56 --> 3074.12]  Pub owner says, sorry, we haven't rented rooms in this pub for years.
[3074.12 --> 3080.46]  The driver says, I really, really think you should reconsider.
[3081.66 --> 3086.50]  The pub owner says, I really, really don't think you heard what I said.
[3087.56 --> 3094.32]  And at that moment, the car door opens and out steps Queen Elizabeth II.
[3094.32 --> 3098.50]  The pub owner says, I think we have room.
[3100.00 --> 3107.92]  And as the queen walks in, they hear the pub owner's wife yell out, we should have cleaned the carpets.
[3107.92 --> 3114.12]  See, this is what Advent is all about.
[3115.08 --> 3119.64]  Advent is this good but disturbing news that God has come.
[3121.14 --> 3123.62]  And God is coming.
[3124.78 --> 3126.86]  What response will you make?
[3127.62 --> 3130.34]  Will you let him in?
[3131.14 --> 3135.04]  Will you let your life be challenged and turned upside down?
[3135.04 --> 3137.94]  Will you welcome the king into your life?
[3138.98 --> 3146.18]  Because of what it means to truly encounter the king who comes is to be like Rahab and to say, I welcome him.
[3147.32 --> 3152.14]  Even though it means I'm going to have to walk away from everything that I've ever known.
[3152.62 --> 3156.78]  Because it is worth it to be rescued by this king.
[3157.78 --> 3160.46]  That is the radical hospitality of Rahab.
[3160.46 --> 3164.08]  Who opens her life and welcomes God in.
[3165.04 --> 3171.24]  But let's look much more briefly at the next thing, which is the hospitality of God.
[3171.62 --> 3172.72]  A hospitality of God.
[3173.02 --> 3174.26]  And so let's continue the story.
[3174.34 --> 3174.86]  What happens?
[3175.96 --> 3179.82]  Rahab decides she's going to cut a deal with the spies.
[3180.24 --> 3181.92]  She's very smart and savvy.
[3182.00 --> 3183.28]  I really admire her here.
[3183.72 --> 3185.50]  I'm not sure if I would have been this quick thinking.
[3185.50 --> 3198.26]  So in verse 12, she says to the spies, now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you.
[3198.60 --> 3198.86]  Okay?
[3198.96 --> 3200.00]  We need a deal here.
[3200.00 --> 3203.90]  She's saying, will you commit to me?
[3204.22 --> 3206.32]  I'm putting my life on the line here and hiding you.
[3206.38 --> 3217.64]  Will you commit to me that when your God brings you into the city and when he brings the city down, that you will commit to me and show me kindness?
[3217.64 --> 3229.74]  And what I love about this is that this word for kindness that she uses is this great Hebrew word that we love, hesed.
[3230.38 --> 3233.36]  The covenant faithfulness of God.
[3234.48 --> 3241.62]  She says, will I be covered by the covenantal loving faithful kindness of God?
[3241.62 --> 3245.66]  And the spies say, sounds good.
[3246.04 --> 3247.24]  Our lives for yours.
[3247.88 --> 3249.64]  So they go back to Joshua.
[3249.88 --> 3251.08]  They give a good report.
[3251.52 --> 3256.98]  And pretty soon, sure enough, the Israelites come across the Jordan and they come to Jericho.
[3257.86 --> 3259.76]  And what's the next thing that happens?
[3259.88 --> 3260.72]  Kids, you need to help me out.
[3260.88 --> 3261.82]  Many of you know the story.
[3262.68 --> 3263.80]  They start to do what?
[3265.36 --> 3266.44]  March around the city.
[3266.86 --> 3267.62]  How many times?
[3268.62 --> 3269.02]  Seven.
[3269.02 --> 3269.14]  Seven.
[3270.12 --> 3274.16]  And what do they do after the seventh time that they march around the city?
[3275.58 --> 3276.58]  Blow their trumpet.
[3276.76 --> 3278.04]  Unfortunately, John didn't bring his trumpet.
[3278.14 --> 3280.68]  I was just saying, you can just like, you know, but no.
[3282.24 --> 3283.54]  They blow the trumpets.
[3284.22 --> 3285.22]  They shout.
[3285.86 --> 3287.74]  And what happens when they blow the trumpets?
[3289.16 --> 3291.62]  The walls come tumbling down.
[3292.16 --> 3292.40]  Right?
[3292.48 --> 3292.94]  That's the song.
[3293.80 --> 3294.64]  The kids song.
[3297.34 --> 3298.70]  Except for one part.
[3299.02 --> 3301.56]  One part of the wall.
[3302.16 --> 3306.98]  The house where Rahab and her family live.
[3307.58 --> 3310.12]  That one part of the wall doesn't fall.
[3311.34 --> 3316.56]  She is covered by the kindness, the faithfulness, the love of God.
[3316.56 --> 3321.26]  And we read about what happens in Joshua chapter 6, verse 25.
[3322.16 --> 3327.06]  But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute with her family and all who belonged to her.
[3327.54 --> 3332.38]  Because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho.
[3332.84 --> 3336.18]  And she lives among the Israelites to this day.
[3336.18 --> 3342.98]  So the Israelites welcome Rahab and her whole family to become part of God's people.
[3343.70 --> 3346.40]  She becomes part of the people of Israel.
[3346.58 --> 3346.92]  You know what?
[3346.96 --> 3355.34]  This tells us that to be a true Israelite, it's not about ethnicity between the Canaanites and the Israelites.
[3355.58 --> 3357.76]  What it's about is allegiance to the Lord.
[3357.76 --> 3359.20]  That's what makes a true Israelite.
[3360.02 --> 3364.12]  And in time, Rahab, she meets an Israelite man named Salmon.
[3364.76 --> 3368.22]  And she and Salmon get married and they have a son named Boaz.
[3368.44 --> 3370.44]  And Boaz will meet a woman named Ruth.
[3370.62 --> 3372.46]  We'll look at her story next week.
[3372.80 --> 3380.16]  They have a son named Obed, who is the father of Jesse, who is the father of King David,
[3380.80 --> 3383.38]  through whom comes Christ the Messiah.
[3383.38 --> 3385.52]  So get this.
[3386.84 --> 3388.36]  Let's think about this picture.
[3388.96 --> 3395.46]  This Canaanite prostitute, this woman who is a religious outsider to God's people,
[3396.10 --> 3402.04]  a moral outsider, a racial, ethnic outsider, she becomes who?
[3403.08 --> 3406.86]  She becomes the great, great, great grandmother of Jesus.
[3408.36 --> 3409.68]  Isn't that amazing?
[3409.68 --> 3413.46]  This is the hospitality of God.
[3414.36 --> 3419.86]  Not only does he welcome a Canaanite prostitute right into his hesed covenantal love,
[3420.24 --> 3425.34]  but then he goes so far as to welcome her into his own family lineage,
[3425.64 --> 3432.20]  so that Rahab herself contributes a genealogical seed to the Savior.
[3433.60 --> 3437.54]  Jesus Christ has the DNA of Rahab the prostitute.
[3437.54 --> 3441.78]  God welcomes her into his own family line.
[3442.58 --> 3445.04]  Remember that verse we looked at from Hebrews.
[3445.18 --> 3445.44]  It said,
[3445.60 --> 3448.66]  By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies,
[3448.74 --> 3450.94]  was not killed with those who were disobedient.
[3451.54 --> 3455.86]  It also says in the same book of Hebrews, in chapter 2, verse 11,
[3455.86 --> 3460.90]  that both the one who makes people holy, that's Jesus,
[3461.72 --> 3469.42]  and those who are made holy, people like Rahab, are of the same family.
[3469.82 --> 3474.36]  So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
[3474.36 --> 3475.58]  Right?
[3475.74 --> 3484.86]  He's not ashamed to claim Rahab and Tamar and others and make them family.
[3486.36 --> 3490.58]  The story of Rahab, it shows us that it doesn't matter who you are.
[3491.34 --> 3493.22]  It doesn't matter what your story is.
[3493.30 --> 3496.46]  It doesn't matter what you have done or what has been done to you.
[3496.72 --> 3499.52]  You are welcomed by the hesed love of God.
[3499.52 --> 3503.72]  You have a place at the table of God's family.
[3505.88 --> 3507.70]  And you know what something else this means?
[3508.58 --> 3513.86]  It means that if you and I really begin to grasp this story of Rahab,
[3514.06 --> 3518.46]  if we begin to grasp this scandalous hospitality of God,
[3519.12 --> 3523.16]  then we might start doing some kind of questionable things ourselves.
[3523.16 --> 3523.88]  Right?
[3524.82 --> 3529.16]  We might start to have eyes to value those who the world sees as outcasts.
[3530.68 --> 3530.90]  Right?
[3530.96 --> 3534.82]  Those who are on the outside of the social center.
[3535.88 --> 3540.34]  We might start to have hearts that love those whom God loves.
[3541.46 --> 3546.08]  We might start to invite them into our lives, into our church.
[3546.08 --> 3551.48]  Even those who might raise some eyebrows.
[3552.74 --> 3553.82]  Wouldn't that be a good thing?
[3555.68 --> 3559.40]  That's what the grace of God does when it starts to take hold of us.
[3560.74 --> 3562.70]  So Rahab's story is the story of hospitality.
[3563.48 --> 3566.06]  By faith, she welcomed the God of Israel
[3566.06 --> 3571.26]  because she believed that his kindness and rescue would welcome her.
[3572.44 --> 3573.66]  And God did that.
[3573.66 --> 3576.22]  Not only did he welcome her,
[3576.80 --> 3579.68]  but he welcomed her right into his own family tree
[3579.68 --> 3583.30]  so that the most unlikely person, Rahab,
[3584.02 --> 3588.84]  the most unlikely person brings forth the Messiah of the world.
[3590.04 --> 3593.88]  But friends, this hospitality was costly.
[3595.10 --> 3596.00]  It was costly.
[3597.14 --> 3599.98]  Not only did God come to be with us,
[3599.98 --> 3601.78]  but when he came,
[3602.58 --> 3604.90]  he came to bear our sin and shame.
[3605.90 --> 3607.78]  He bore our exile.
[3608.78 --> 3611.26]  Hebrew says he was put outside the city gates.
[3611.86 --> 3614.00]  He was put with the outcasts,
[3614.06 --> 3614.94]  with the excluded,
[3615.36 --> 3617.38]  to be crucified on Golgotha
[3617.38 --> 3619.62]  as the scum of the earth
[3619.62 --> 3622.32]  so that all,
[3622.54 --> 3623.92]  all,
[3624.26 --> 3625.90]  might be welcomed in
[3625.90 --> 3626.90]  through faith in him.
[3626.90 --> 3630.34]  Friends, I'll close with this.
[3630.58 --> 3633.02]  Revelation chapter 3 verse 20.
[3633.40 --> 3634.50]  This is what Jesus says.
[3635.54 --> 3636.20]  Here I am.
[3637.48 --> 3639.20]  I stand at the door and knock.
[3639.94 --> 3643.16]  If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
[3643.92 --> 3646.44]  I will come in and eat with that person
[3646.44 --> 3648.32]  and they with me.
[3648.32 --> 3652.34]  Will you welcome him?
[3653.74 --> 3655.94]  Will you welcome the one
[3655.94 --> 3658.54]  who has welcomed you?
[3659.38 --> 3660.24]  Let's pray.
[3660.24 --> 3665.58]  O God of welcome,
[3666.72 --> 3667.76]  who are we?
[3669.42 --> 3670.46]  The Rahabs,
[3670.62 --> 3671.38]  the Tamars,
[3672.52 --> 3673.20]  the Rus,
[3673.44 --> 3674.18]  the Bathshebas,
[3674.96 --> 3676.28]  the Judas,
[3676.90 --> 3677.84]  the King Davids,
[3678.84 --> 3680.44]  all this world, Lord,
[3680.52 --> 3681.42]  who are so
[3681.42 --> 3684.50]  broken by our own sin
[3684.50 --> 3685.56]  and the sin of the world,
[3685.74 --> 3687.28]  Lord, that you would welcome us,
[3687.62 --> 3688.64]  the God of Israel,
[3688.64 --> 3690.08]  the God of heaven above
[3690.08 --> 3690.90]  and earth below,
[3691.48 --> 3694.50]  that you would condescend yourself,
[3695.46 --> 3697.72]  be born in squalor,
[3698.80 --> 3700.88]  cry out as an infant,
[3701.78 --> 3705.38]  and die an ignoble death
[3705.38 --> 3708.40]  so that you can make us family.
[3708.40 --> 3713.40]  Father, we thank you for your chesed,
[3713.98 --> 3715.44]  faithful covenant love.
[3715.54 --> 3717.02]  You are the covenant-keeping God.
[3717.12 --> 3718.36]  It doesn't depend on us,
[3718.76 --> 3719.86]  but it depends
[3719.86 --> 3722.80]  only, Lord, on who you are
[3722.80 --> 3724.32]  and what you have done.
[3725.34 --> 3727.12]  Lord, you are our rescuer.
[3728.72 --> 3731.30]  Lord, we welcome you into our lives.
[3732.18 --> 3733.58]  Lord, would you rescue us
[3733.58 --> 3736.72]  and make us your people.
[3737.78 --> 3739.36]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3739.96 --> 3740.24]  Amen.
[3742.28 --> 3742.88]  All right.
[3743.12 --> 3744.24]  So would you please stand?
[3745.24 --> 3745.72]  Amen.
[3745.72 --> 3746.72]  Amen.
[3775.72 --> 3776.72]  Amen.
[3805.72 --> 3806.72]  Amen.
[3835.72 --> 3836.72]  Amen.
[3865.72 --> 3873.04]  Amen.
[3893.04 --> 3893.72]  Amen.
[3893.72 --> 3895.26]  Our offering this morning is for
[3895.26 --> 3902.44]  local church ministries and as you can imagine any funds that are received for that today will
[3902.44 --> 3909.44]  go towards local programs like GEMS, Cadets, Kids Life, our Mandarin ministry and the list goes on.
[3909.44 --> 3911.62]  So please give as you're able.
[3925.26 --> 3936.02]  .
[3951.40 --> 3952.40]  .
[3952.40 --> 3954.40]  Amen.
[3982.40 --> 3984.40]  Amen.
[4012.40 --> 4014.40]  Amen.
[4042.40 --> 4044.40]  Amen.
[4044.40 --> 4046.40]  Amen.
[4046.40 --> 4048.40]  Amen.
[4048.40 --> 4050.40]  Amen.
[4050.40 --> 4052.40]  Amen.
[4052.40 --> 4054.40]  Amen.
[4054.40 --> 4056.40]  Amen.
[4062.40 --> 4070.40]  It's time for our communal prayer, but before we join together for that, just a couple of good news items that were too late for the bulletin.
[4070.40 --> 4076.40]  And that is that both Pastor Nancy and Grace Koistra have been able to return home from the hospital.
[4076.40 --> 4082.40]  They're for various reasons, but it's certainly a sign of God's grace and healing that they have been well enough to return home,
[4082.40 --> 4086.40]  even though we still want to keep them in our prayers for further healing.
[4086.40 --> 4089.40]  So please join me in prayer.
[4089.40 --> 4091.40]  Amen.
[4091.40 --> 4103.40]  Eternal God, for whom all people wait and search, even though we don't realize it, we cry out today for a live and present word from you.
[4103.40 --> 4113.40]  As our season of discontent approaches the day of your coming, we pray that you would speak to us in the graceful ways that you know best.
[4113.40 --> 4126.40]  Open our eyes that have been closed by fear and blinded by self-pity, that we may see you, even in the anxieties and uncertainties that beset our days and threaten to overwhelm us.
[4126.40 --> 4140.40]  Help us to see that amid the hustle and bustle of this holiday time, the crowded stores, rude shoppers, impatient drivers, frayed generosity, you have become incarnate,
[4140.40 --> 4148.40]  sanctifying the smallest tasks of love, generosity and kindness that we are enabled by your grace to perform.
[4148.40 --> 4155.40]  We think of the needs of others at this time, O Lord, and we are embarrassed by our selfishness.
[4155.40 --> 4167.40]  May the answer to our prayers begin with us to redeem the times, bring to all those who are in need the alleviation of their poverty or comfort for their minds and spirits.
[4167.40 --> 4177.40]  Enable us to do what we can to help them, to share our own happiness and prosperity, to provide a listening ear or friendly word,
[4177.40 --> 4181.40]  to do errands or acts of kindness.
[4181.40 --> 4192.40]  We pray that the promise of your birth, that peace shall be on earth, may soon be fulfilled, both in our troubled hearts and in our troubled world.
[4192.40 --> 4197.40]  Come to us, Lord, for we need your presence in our lives.
[4197.40 --> 4205.40]  We pray especially for those dear to us who are sick or troubled or unsure or near the hour of their death.
[4205.40 --> 4210.40]  In particular, we hold up before you this morning, Jordan and Vanessa Vantal,
[4210.40 --> 4216.40]  giving them both strength as Jordan goes through treatments for cancer and we pray for full healing for Jordan.
[4218.40 --> 4227.40]  We give thanks that Pastor Nancy was able to return from the hospital, but we also pray for healing from her surgery and grant her full healing.
[4227.40 --> 4237.40]  We also pray for Grace Koistra and again pray that she's well enough to come back from the hospital and she can fully recover as well.
[4237.40 --> 4244.40]  And also, please be near Pat Bertnik's granddaughter Grace and grant her as well full healing.
[4244.40 --> 4250.40]  We pray for the world into which you came and which you still love.
[4250.40 --> 4256.40]  We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine, a scale of destruction not seen for generations.
[4256.40 --> 4267.40]  We pray for your wisdom and your spirit to work in the hearts of the leaders to find a path forward to end this conflict and move from destroying to rebuilding.
[4267.40 --> 4280.40]  Pray for the nation of Somalia, where the problems of successive years of drought and infestation are compounded by the actions of rebel groups preventing aid from reaching those in need.
[4280.40 --> 4285.40]  Affecting millions with food insecurity and even famine.
[4285.40 --> 4292.40]  Please work in the hearts of all those individuals and nations that can help make a difference for this troubled region.
[4293.40 --> 4300.40]  We thank you, Lord, for the beauty of your creation, for the changing seasons and the renewal made possible through that.
[4300.40 --> 4307.40]  For the intricacy of life that you brought into being and which we struggle to even understand.
[4307.40 --> 4316.40]  We thank you for this time that we can be together this morning in praise of you, exploring your word and seeking your intercession.
[4317.40 --> 4319.40]  Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.
[4320.40 --> 4328.40]  Help us to be effective servants to you and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
[4329.40 --> 4332.40]  We thank you for hearing our prayers, Lord. Amen.
[4337.40 --> 4338.40]  Please rise.
[4338.40 --> 4356.40]  So our Lord not only delights when we come before him with our needs, our requests, our prayers, but also he has the last word.
[4357.40 --> 4361.40]  So we go out with his good word upon us, his favor.
[4361.40 --> 4364.40]  So here's the Lord's blessing.
[4364.40 --> 4373.40]  To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4374.40 --> 4383.40]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power and authority through Jesus Christ, our Lord, before all ages now and forevermore.
[4383.40 --> 4384.40]  Amen.
[4384.40 --> 4385.40]  Amen.
[4385.40 --> 4402.40]  Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[4402.40 --> 4411.40]  God, be all else till we sleep that now are.
[4411.40 --> 4418.40]  Thou my best, O Lord, my day or by night.
[4419.40 --> 4427.40]  Waking or sleeping, thy presence, my Lord.
[4427.40 --> 4429.40]  God, be all else till we sleep that now are.
[4429.40 --> 4434.40]  My King of heaven, my victory, my.
[4434.40 --> 4445.40]  May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's song.
[4445.40 --> 4454.40]  God of my own heart, whatever be, God.
[4454.40 --> 4464.40]  Still be thy vision, O ruler of love.
[4484.40 --> 4486.40]  Amen.
[4514.40 --> 4516.40]  Amen.
