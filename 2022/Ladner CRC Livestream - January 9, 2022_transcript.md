[309.92 --> 312.64]  Greetings this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[314.16 --> 320.36]  And I do pray that each one of us this morning may find great joy and spiritual nourishment
[320.36 --> 323.62]  as we come before the Lord and worship together this morning.
[323.92 --> 328.38]  Just a couple of quick announcements before we begin.
[328.98 --> 334.06]  Our designated offering for this Sunday is for Therefore Go Ministries.
[334.76 --> 342.76]  And this is a Christian organization that organizes mission trips, short-term mission trips for
[342.76 --> 343.60]  youth.
[344.08 --> 346.84]  They take trips in the United States and in Canada.
[346.84 --> 353.60]  And they actually have roots in the CRC, but they are now a non-denominational ministry.
[353.60 --> 356.80]  And so they work and partner with all kinds of different denominations.
[356.80 --> 364.56]  And so we still are not passing an offering basket, but we have some drop boxes by the doors where
[364.56 --> 369.62]  you can leave your donations and also you can give online or bring a check to the church.
[369.62 --> 378.70]  Our hospital singing, which was originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to January the 30th.
[378.70 --> 386.34]  And I also want to bring your attention to some groups that we are starting called listening circles.
[387.42 --> 392.54]  And so as probably many of you have heard and seen, we've talked about it here.
[393.26 --> 402.20]  Our denomination has released a human sexuality report that will be going before synod next summer.
[402.20 --> 411.00]  And the denomination is encouraging all of the churches to receive the report, to read it, and to talk about it.
[411.02 --> 417.98]  And so they provided some tools where they encouraged some groups to get together and to read the report and just to
[417.98 --> 421.02]  reflect on it, to share our own reactions to it.
[421.16 --> 423.52]  And so we are going to be hosting these groups.
[424.08 --> 428.86]  And so if you are interested, and I encourage many of us to join.
[428.86 --> 435.46]  And even if you aren't particularly necessarily interested in the report, it's still a great
[435.46 --> 440.12]  exercise to learn how to listen well to one another.
[440.68 --> 445.82]  And so I actually, I think there's applications even beyond what we would actually be discussing.
[446.18 --> 449.08]  And so you can sign up on the sheet in the foyer.
[449.26 --> 452.00]  You can also just contact me or Dorothy in the office to sign up.
[454.16 --> 457.48]  So let's prepare our hearts now for worship.
[457.48 --> 462.42]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Isaiah 60.
[463.48 --> 469.62]  And where it has the little double arrow throughout the service, I encourage you to say it and read along with me.
[471.86 --> 475.08]  Arise, shine, for your light has come.
[476.22 --> 479.76]  The glory of the Lord has risen upon us.
[479.76 --> 483.32]  Let us praise the Lord together.
[484.00 --> 489.84]  The sun shall no longer be our light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on us.
[490.58 --> 496.00]  For the Lord will be our light, and our God will be our glory.
[497.12 --> 502.50]  The Lord will be our everlasting light, and our days of sorrow will end.
[502.50 --> 508.40]  Come, let us sing to the Lord our light and salvation.
[509.00 --> 510.24]  Would you please pray with me?
[510.64 --> 511.30]  Let's pray together.
[511.30 --> 516.94]  Praise be to the Lord our Lord Jesus Christ.
[516.94 --> 526.40]  In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[527.12 --> 531.36]  And into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[531.36 --> 536.16]  This inheritance is kept in heaven for us.
[536.84 --> 551.72]  We worship you and adore you this morning, our Heavenly Father, as our creator, as our faithful sustainer, as our beautiful Savior, and as our bright hope for today and tomorrow.
[552.30 --> 554.10]  Truly our hope is in you, Lord.
[554.72 --> 556.74]  Truly our hope is in you alone.
[556.74 --> 564.58]  All glory and honor be to you, O Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever.
[565.46 --> 565.86]  Amen.
[566.90 --> 570.04]  So I invite you to stand as you are able.
[570.82 --> 574.52]  Our Lord has called us to worship, and he now greets us with these words.
[575.20 --> 577.50]  Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[578.36 --> 583.14]  For the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever.
[583.14 --> 588.72]  So as the Lord has greeted us, I invite you to turn and to greet one another.
[589.14 --> 589.86]  And then we will sing.
[589.86 --> 589.90]  Amen.
[613.14 --> 621.78]  Amen.
[621.78 --> 621.86]  Heavenly Father has hiccuping our praise, and we'll sing it to you.
[621.86 --> 622.46]  Amen.
[622.46 --> 624.62]  Heavenly Father has Königly and bless you, O Lord, here God is the Holy Spirit.
[624.62 --> 625.82]  Amen.
[625.82 --> 626.32]  Amen.
[635.32 --> 636.42]  Amen.
[636.42 --> 637.06]  Amen.
[637.06 --> 637.66]  Amen.
[637.66 --> 638.92]  Amen.
[638.92 --> 639.36]  Amen.
[639.36 --> 640.66]  Amen.
[640.66 --> 650.44]  Early in the glory, our song shall rise to thee.
[650.44 --> 669.34]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[670.66 --> 692.66]  Holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the vast sea.
[692.66 --> 714.66]  Jeremiah, and Shephle, falling down before thee, whole worded heart and evermore shall be.
[714.66 --> 721.66]  Amen.
[721.66 --> 745.94]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
[745.94 --> 756.80]  All my works shall reign in earth and sky and sea.
[757.92 --> 767.94]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
[768.80 --> 796.70]  All my impetus will be pureazione through community.
[796.70 --> 805.80]  better versions of ourselves. You know, maybe it's to exercise more or eat less or both. Maybe it's
[805.80 --> 809.70]  to read more books or spend more time with friends. And all these are good things to do.
[810.52 --> 817.10]  But when we come to confession, we're not trying to become better versions of ourselves,
[817.70 --> 823.74]  but rather by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are asking Christ to make us more like himself.
[823.74 --> 830.76]  And so we take up this gift of confession to acknowledge before God that we cannot be
[830.76 --> 840.54]  all that we wish to be on our own. But he, thanks be to God, is committed to making us new,
[841.30 --> 845.70]  to conforming us more and more into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[846.64 --> 850.28]  And so let's pray to the Lord in a prayer of confession.
[850.28 --> 857.02]  And we'll say this prayer together, then I'll give you a moment of silent confession. Let's pray.
[858.30 --> 867.78]  Almighty God, to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are in,
[867.78 --> 877.60]  cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you
[877.60 --> 885.60]  and worthily magnify your holy name through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
[886.20 --> 888.42]  I invite you to take a moment of silent confession.
[888.42 --> 918.40]  Thank you.
[918.42 --> 926.16]  Father God, we thank you that when you look upon us, you look at us through the perfect life, death, and resurrection
[926.16 --> 929.20]  of your Son and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[930.34 --> 937.90]  And Lord, your plans and hopes for us are even far beyond our own wishes for ourselves.
[937.90 --> 946.96]  Because you know all of the ways, Lord, that we need to be transformed, all of the sin that is hidden so deeply in our hearts.
[947.64 --> 950.12]  And that comes out in such destructive ways.
[951.38 --> 958.12]  The Lord, we thank you that through Christ, we can be made clean by his shed blood for us.
[958.12 --> 966.92]  And Father, so we come before you looking to Christ, asking the Holy Spirit to work within us, to change us,
[967.40 --> 970.64]  so that we would seek to follow Christ more closely.
[971.16 --> 972.56]  Father, we thank you for this grace.
[973.26 --> 974.96]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[974.96 --> 977.62]  So please stand again.
[978.02 --> 980.36]  Hear these words of assurance of pardon.
[981.70 --> 987.16]  May the light of Christ, rising in glory, banish all darkness from your hearts and minds.
[988.78 --> 995.10]  Forgive you your sins, grant you the joy of his kingdom, and raise you to new and everlasting life.
[996.06 --> 996.46]  Amen.
[996.46 --> 997.72]  Let's sing together.
[997.72 --> 997.84]  Amen.
[997.84 --> 997.90]  Amen.
[997.90 --> 998.00]  Amen.
[1026.46 --> 1028.00]  Amen.
[1028.00 --> 1029.02]  Let's sing together.
[1029.02 --> 1030.34]  Amen.
[1030.34 --> 1030.96]  2021.
[1030.96 --> 1031.14]  Amen.
[1031.20 --> 1033.10]  Today in the next episode, we pray in Jesus' Name, S Firebase, is the message of God.
[1033.10 --> 1034.14]  Amen.
[1034.14 --> 1046.24]  Let them hopefully stand by these words.
[1046.40 --> 1048.86]  Let them how our lives are in Jesus' name.
[1048.86 --> 1051.86]  Let them pray in Jesus' name, love loans.
[1051.86 --> 1054.90]  We pray in Jesus' name, and in Jesus' name, Lord, we pray.
[1054.90 --> 1055.92]  Amen.
[1055.92 --> 1061.28]  The King, O Star, my love.
[1061.82 --> 1067.94]  Take my feet and let them be.
[1068.48 --> 1074.68]  Swift and beautiful for Thee.
[1074.68 --> 1082.28]  Swift and beautiful for Thee.
[1082.28 --> 1090.82]  Take my voice and let them sing.
[1091.24 --> 1097.52]  Always only before my King.
[1097.52 --> 1104.52]  Take my hand to let them be.
[1105.00 --> 1111.34]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1111.34 --> 1118.88]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1118.88 --> 1126.42]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1126.42 --> 1128.42]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1128.42 --> 1132.42]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1132.42 --> 1141.96]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1141.96 --> 1143.96]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1143.96 --> 1153.50]  Filled with messages from Thee.

[1155.50 --> 1165.04]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1165.04 --> 1172.58]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1172.58 --> 1176.58]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1176.58 --> 1186.12]  Filled with messages from Thee.
[1186.12 --> 1186.62]  You may be seated.
[1186.62 --> 1196.16]  Filled with messages from Thee, O Star, my God.
[1196.16 --> 1200.84]  Joe and Winnie Luo and to receive them into our fellowship.
[1200.84 --> 1206.16]  And because they are from our Chinese ministry and because of COVID, we haven't had a whole
[1206.16 --> 1211.32]  lot of time to get to know them and for each other.
[1211.32 --> 1213.40]  And so we're going to hear their testimonies.
[1213.40 --> 1217.40]  They're each pretty short, but we'll play those videos for us and they get a chance to
[1217.40 --> 1221.16]  hear their own journey of faith and coming to the Lord Jesus.
[1221.16 --> 1226.16]  Hello,大家好, I'm Winnie.
[1226.16 --> 1230.16]  I've been here to Canada for four years.
[1230.16 --> 1232.16]  We've been living in Lennon.
[1232.16 --> 1234.16]  We have two little children.
[1234.16 --> 1237.16]  My son is 5, and my son is 2.
[1237.16 --> 1240.16]  I was in a university in the university.
[1240.16 --> 1244.16]  I studied some biblical teaching.
[1244.16 --> 1250.16]  And in this process, I started to see God a lot of faith.
[1250.16 --> 1251.16]  God that I want neither to God or other 친구� has been COVID.
[1252.16 --> 1254.16]  So they are here to post 예의出來, as a really realized.
[1254.16 --> 1255.16]  We're one of the achievements of our church.
[1255.16 --> 1268.56]  We are so grateful to these students of Christ andvelines 세�
[1268.56 --> 1270.16]  and amigos who were those who were out there.
[1270.16 --> 1275.16]  Every time when they usediques folk together, I can feel trulystonified.
[1275.16 --> 1282.16]  I always hear many songs, because in the Lord, everything is very peaceful and happy.
[1282.16 --> 1289.16]  Now, when I encounter a very difficult thing, I don't have any fear.
[1289.16 --> 1294.16]  I want to give myself to God, and I want to pray for God.
[1294.16 --> 1299.16]  I know that the things on the ground and the happy are short and short.
[1299.16 --> 1302.16]  Our life is in the天.
[1302.16 --> 1313.16]  So, at the end, I want to thank Nancy for bringing me to God's face and strength, and let me be able to heal. Amen.
[1316.16 --> 1318.16]  Hello everyone, I am Winnie.
[1318.16 --> 1322.16]  I have two children, my husband and my mother.
[1322.16 --> 1329.16]  Today is my most happy and most sad day, because I am the Savior of Jesus.
[1329.16 --> 1331.16]  I am the Savior of Jesus.
[1331.16 --> 1335.16]  I have been in the 2000s to Canada for 20 years.
[1335.16 --> 1340.16]  And Jesus is still waiting for me to turn to him.
[1340.16 --> 1344.16]  And I also have my neighbor Charles.
[1344.16 --> 1347.16]  And I am here to Nana's church.
[1347.16 --> 1351.16]  I met Nancy, and I am here to sing a song.
[1351.16 --> 1353.16]  And I am here to sing a song.
[1353.16 --> 1355.16]  And I am here to sing a song.
[1355.16 --> 1358.16]  And I am here to this church.
[1358.16 --> 1360.16]  I have changed a lot.
[1360.16 --> 1362.16]  I have learned to thank God.
[1362.16 --> 1365.16]  I have learned to sing a song.
[1365.16 --> 1374.16]  I hope my children in the church and the church will be in the future.
[1374.16 --> 1378.16]  And they will share their love.
[1378.16 --> 1380.16]  They will share their love.
[1380.16 --> 1381.16]  with their love.
[1381.16 --> 1382.16]  I love them.
[1382.16 --> 1383.16]  I love them.
[1383.16 --> 1384.16]  And they will be praying.
[1384.16 --> 1386.16]  And they will pray to pray.
[1386.16 --> 1388.16]  And they will pray.
[1388.16 --> 1389.16]  And read the Bible.
[1389.16 --> 1390.16]  And read the Bible.
[1392.16 --> 1394.16]  And I will follow the Bible.
[1394.16 --> 1395.16]  And let the Bible.
[1395.16 --> 1397.16]  I love you.
[1397.16 --> 1398.16]  For the Lord.
[1398.16 --> 1399.16]  And I love you.
[1399.16 --> 1400.16]  And I will pray.
[1400.16 --> 1401.16]  I love you.
[1401.16 --> 1402.16]  Amen.
[1402.16 --> 1418.24]  So I hope you are as excited to see those videos and meet Winnie and Winnie.
[1418.24 --> 1425.40]  So there's two Winnies, which is fun and coincidental.
[1425.40 --> 1427.28]  So let's invite them up.
[1427.28 --> 1429.28]  Winnie Law and Winnie Jo.
[1429.28 --> 1436.28]  So both Winnies have completed the baptism of baptism.
[1436.28 --> 1444.28]  And they came in the medical hospital to be able to get to know them in their stories.
[1444.28 --> 1450.28]  And they've also expressed their desire to be baptized.
[1450.28 --> 1457.28]  So hear these words now where the Lord Jesus instituted the sacrament of baptism.
[1457.28 --> 1462.28]  And it's an invitation and a promise to all of us.
[1462.28 --> 1467.28]  Jesus says, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1467.28 --> 1478.28]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1478.28 --> 1485.28]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[1485.28 --> 1489.28]  and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[1489.28 --> 1493.28]  And surely I am with you always, even to the very end of the age.
[1493.28 --> 1500.28]  And so in obedience to this command, the church baptizes adult believers and their children.
[1500.28 --> 1511.28]  And when we are baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the triune God seals our adoption as his children and claims us as his own.
[1511.28 --> 1516.28]  So here's what 1 Peter 2 says.
[1516.28 --> 1524.28]  You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.
[1524.28 --> 1529.28]  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[1529.28 --> 1532.28]  So by baptism, we become the people of God.
[1532.28 --> 1534.28]  God becomes our heavenly Father.
[1534.28 --> 1539.28]  And we have a new identity in Jesus Christ.
[1539.28 --> 1551.28]  So I am going to ask the Winnies their vows, and then I'll ask you a vow as well.
[1551.28 --> 1553.28]  So, Winnie and Winnie.
[1553.28 --> 1555.28]  We can say it together, okay?
[1555.28 --> 1557.28]  All right.
[1557.28 --> 1563.28]  Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[1563.28 --> 1564.28]  Okay.
[1564.28 --> 1570.28]  Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from sin?
[1570.28 --> 1577.28]  And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[1577.28 --> 1588.28]  And do you promise to do all you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love and commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of this church?
[1588.28 --> 1589.28]  Okay.
[1589.28 --> 1590.28]  Okay.
[1590.28 --> 1593.28]  And congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1593.28 --> 1595.28]  I have a question for you.
[1595.28 --> 1607.28]  Brothers and sisters, do you promise to receive Winnie Jo and Winnie Law into your fellowship as members of the body of Christ and to assist them to be Christ's faithful disciples?
[1608.28 --> 1609.28]  Do you?
[1609.28 --> 1610.28]  Hold on, I have more for you to say.
[1610.28 --> 1611.28]  Do you?
[1611.28 --> 1612.28]  All right.
[1612.28 --> 1613.28]  Let's say it together.
[1613.28 --> 1615.28]  Do you, Lord, and thanks to you.
[1615.28 --> 1618.28]  We welcome you unto Christ's churches.
[1618.28 --> 1621.28]  For you are all alone in Christ.
[1621.28 --> 1627.28]  Do you promise us to love and encourage and support you.
[1627.28 --> 1630.28]  And now we know and follow Christ.
[1630.28 --> 1630.72]  Amen.
[1633.46 --> 1634.56]  Let's pray together.
[1635.42 --> 1641.32]  We thank you, Father, that by the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1641.58 --> 1646.10]  the living water, that he forgives us, he frees us from sin and death,
[1646.38 --> 1648.32]  and opens the way to life everlasting.
[1649.06 --> 1651.42]  We thank you, O God, for this gift of baptism,
[1652.24 --> 1657.58]  that in this water you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death,
[1657.58 --> 1660.90]  and we are raised to share in his resurrection,
[1661.70 --> 1664.90]  and are even now being renewed by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1665.96 --> 1671.80]  Father, send your Spirit, now we pray, upon Winnie, Joe, and Winnie Law,
[1672.12 --> 1679.96]  that this water may be to them a sign and seal of your love and of eternal life.
[1680.78 --> 1686.06]  Father, would you, by your Spirit, wash away their sins, raise them to new life,
[1686.06 --> 1691.82]  and enfold them into the body of Christ, your church of people
[1691.82 --> 1694.68]  from every tongue, tribe, and nation around the world.
[1695.34 --> 1697.94]  We pray in Jesus' name and to the glory of God.
[1698.62 --> 1698.96]  Amen.
[1698.96 --> 1699.08]  Amen.
[1716.06 --> 1726.94]  Winnie, Joe, the Lord Jesus Christ chose you from before the foundation of the world.
[1727.66 --> 1732.68]  He came into this world and lived for you, and he died on the cross for you,
[1732.76 --> 1736.38]  and he rose again from the dead for you and ascended into heaven for you,
[1736.54 --> 1740.86]  and one day he will return to bring you home into his everlasting kingdom.
[1740.86 --> 1751.38]  Winnie, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1752.78 --> 1753.14]  Amen.
[1755.28 --> 1756.32]  You may stand.
[1758.62 --> 1759.36]  Here we go.
[1759.36 --> 1761.36]  Amen.
[1761.36 --> 1762.36]  Amen.
[1766.86 --> 1772.80]  And Winnie Law, the Lord Jesus Christ, from before the foundation of the world, he chose you,
[1773.44 --> 1781.54]  and he came into this world to save you, and he lived for you the perfect life that we were meant to live,
[1781.60 --> 1785.98]  and he died on the cross to forgive you of your sins, and he rose from the dead,
[1785.98 --> 1792.90]  conquering death and sin for you, and one day he will return to bring you into his everlasting kingdom.
[1794.72 --> 1802.98]  Winnie, Lord, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[1804.20 --> 1804.68]  Amen.
[1809.18 --> 1814.44]  So let's pray for God's blessing upon them.
[1814.88 --> 1815.34]  Let's pray.
[1816.72 --> 1822.86]  Gracious God and Heavenly Father, we thank you that you make us new creations in Jesus Christ through grace alone.
[1823.64 --> 1827.60]  Father, we pray for Winnie, Joe, and Winnie Law.
[1828.18 --> 1831.76]  Would you bless and strengthen them daily by the gift of your Holy Spirit?
[1832.46 --> 1836.96]  Would you unfold to them the riches of your love and your mercy in their lives?
[1837.48 --> 1839.96]  Would you deepen them in their faith?
[1839.96 --> 1848.70]  Would you keep them from the power of evil and enable them to live a holy and blameless life until your kingdom comes?
[1848.70 --> 1850.30]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1851.12 --> 1851.48]  Amen.
[1851.48 --> 1852.10]  Okay.
[1852.10 --> 1852.18]  Okay.
[1854.58 --> 1860.10]  And we have a baptism certificate and a Bible for you.
[1860.10 --> 1860.20]  Thank you.
[1860.20 --> 1867.84]  Thank you.

[1916.12 --> 1919.96]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[1919.96 --> 1923.00]  O God, thy Father,
[1924.28 --> 1930.16]  there is no shadow of turning within.
[1932.22 --> 1939.78]  Thou changest all thy compassions with him not.
[1939.78 --> 1947.92]  As the last thing thou forever will be.
[1948.76 --> 1952.70]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[1953.04 --> 1957.02]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[1957.64 --> 1965.04]  Morning, night, morning, new mercy I see.

[1974.58 --> 1978.96]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[1979.48 --> 1983.02]  Lord, answer me.
[1986.02 --> 1994.02]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[1994.02 --> 2002.00]  Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[2002.94 --> 2010.00]  Joy with all nature in man is all greatness.

[2019.00 --> 2024.00]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[2024.00 --> 2029.32]  Great is thy faithfulness.
[2029.98 --> 2036.00]  Morning, night, morning, new mercy I see.

[2045.00 --> 2050.00]  Great is thy faithfulness.

[2145.00 --> 2147.00]  CHOIR SINGS
[2147.00 --> 2153.42]  So there are two sacraments that we celebrate today, which is really amazing.
[2153.42 --> 2158.38]  And so the first was baptism, and the second sacrament is the Lord's Supper.
[2159.16 --> 2164.80]  And just like we were baptized once as a sign of our belonging to Jesus Christ,
[2165.30 --> 2171.30]  but still through our whole Christian lives, we regularly partake of the Lord's Supper.
[2171.30 --> 2177.00]  And Jesus Christ invites you to this table of His grace.
[2177.46 --> 2179.24]  He invites the weary.
[2180.42 --> 2183.00]  He invites all those who mourn and lament.
[2184.10 --> 2187.32]  He invites those who know they need His salvation.
[2187.32 --> 2192.60]  And so this morning, if you trust in Jesus Christ for your salvation,
[2193.10 --> 2196.16]  and if you are a baptized member of His church,
[2196.32 --> 2202.10]  then come, trusting and believing and looking to the Lord Jesus
[2202.10 --> 2207.06]  for His boundless hope by His presence in the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2207.06 --> 2211.94]  And so I want to do something a little bit different today,
[2211.94 --> 2215.04]  and I want to say together something that's called the Great Thanksgiving.
[2215.80 --> 2218.02]  So we'll have the words here, and let's say these together
[2218.02 --> 2220.84]  as a way to prepare our hearts for the Lord's table.
[2221.60 --> 2223.20]  The Lord be with you.
[2223.48 --> 2225.12]  And also with you.
[2226.08 --> 2227.32]  Lift up your hearts.
[2227.94 --> 2229.88]  We live up to the Lord.
[2230.76 --> 2233.42]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[2234.22 --> 2237.04]  He is right to be our thanks and prayer.
[2237.06 --> 2240.98]  It is right and good and a joyful thing,
[2241.26 --> 2244.08]  always and everywhere, to give thanks to you, O Lord.
[2244.76 --> 2248.86]  Therefore, with all who worship you, both in heaven and on earth,
[2249.10 --> 2252.16]  we offer you our praise, saying,
[2253.54 --> 2259.08]  Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
[2259.90 --> 2262.80]  heaven and earth are full of your glory.
[2263.66 --> 2265.68]  Hosanna in the highest.
[2265.68 --> 2266.96]  Hosanna in the highest.
[2266.96 --> 2270.60]  Now I want to take a moment and allow you to prepare your own hearts
[2270.60 --> 2271.66]  to come before the Lord,
[2272.38 --> 2275.36]  and to prepare to come and to feed with Him,
[2276.04 --> 2277.46]  feed on Him at His table.
[2277.92 --> 2279.08]  Let's prepare our hearts together.
[2279.08 --> 2279.14]  Amen.
[2279.14 --> 2279.28]  Amen.
[2279.28 --> 2279.34]  Amen.
[2279.34 --> 2279.42]  Amen.
[2279.42 --> 2280.40]  Amen.
[2280.40 --> 2281.46]  Amen.
[2281.46 --> 2282.46]  Amen.
[2282.46 --> 2283.26]  Amen.
[2283.26 --> 2283.32]  Amen.
[2283.32 --> 2284.42]  Amen.
[2284.42 --> 2285.40]  Amen.
[2285.40 --> 2285.90]  Amen.
[2285.90 --> 2286.38]  Amen.
[2286.38 --> 2287.24]  Amen.
[2287.24 --> 2287.30]  Amen.
[2287.30 --> 2287.94]  Amen.
[2287.94 --> 2288.46]  Amen.
[2288.46 --> 2289.40]  Amen.
[2289.40 --> 2290.56]  Amen.
[2290.56 --> 2291.28]  Amen.
[2291.28 --> 2292.36]  Amen.
[2292.36 --> 2292.52]  Amen.
[2295.68 --> 2299.58]  Amen.
[2299.88 --> 2300.16]  Amen.
[2301.16 --> 2301.64]  Amen.
[2301.64 --> 2302.10]  beloved of God,
[2302.74 --> 2304.54]  hear these words of institution.
[2304.54 --> 2304.66]  Amen.
[2305.86 --> 2308.22]  The Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed,
[2308.30 --> 2309.06]  He took bread.
[2309.88 --> 2311.12]  And when He had given thanks,
[2311.16 --> 2312.90]  He broke it and said,
[2313.04 --> 2314.02]  This is my body,
[2314.44 --> 2315.36]  which is for you.
[2315.88 --> 2318.32]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[2318.80 --> 2319.30]  I remember it.
[2321.46 --> 2321.60]  Amen.
[2321.60 --> 2325.68]  In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[2325.90 --> 2328.66]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[2329.24 --> 2333.10]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[2334.20 --> 2338.56]  For as often, for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[2338.60 --> 2341.94]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[2343.04 --> 2346.98]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[2346.98 --> 2352.84]  Come now and feast on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving,
[2353.42 --> 2357.78]  knowing and remembering and trusting that the Lord Jesus Christ has died for you.
[2361.44 --> 2366.18]  So because of our COVID cautions we want to take,
[2366.28 --> 2370.08]  we will continue this Sunday to also come forward to receive the elements.
[2370.90 --> 2373.42]  And so we will have our servers with the bread and cup,
[2373.42 --> 2378.70]  and our ushers, please, will invite you.
[2380.20 --> 2385.12]  And as you come, come to the household, as families, couples.
[2385.86 --> 2387.46]  You can eat together.
[2388.12 --> 2391.50]  So the elder will give you each one a bread,
[2391.76 --> 2394.10]  and then he or she will say together,
[2394.24 --> 2395.14]  This is the body of Christ.
[2395.22 --> 2397.54]  And at that time, everyone can eat together,
[2397.64 --> 2399.96]  then go to take the juice,
[2399.96 --> 2403.72]  and then you can go around the outsides back to your seats.
[2404.58 --> 2406.84]  And so let's celebrate the Lord's Supper together,
[2406.98 --> 2407.68]  and we'll have some music,
[2408.02 --> 2410.14]  and you can meditate and come when you are called.
[2410.14 --> 2411.24]  Amen.
[2413.24 --> 2414.14]  Amen.
[2414.40 --> 2415.48]  Amen.
[2416.58 --> 2417.70]  Amen.
[2437.70 --> 2438.18]  Amen.
[2438.18 --> 2438.26]  Amen.
[2438.26 --> 2440.26]  Amen.
[2468.26 --> 2470.26]  Amen.
[2498.26 --> 2500.26]  Amen.
[2528.26 --> 2530.26]  Amen.
[2558.26 --> 2560.26]  Amen.
[2588.26 --> 2590.26]  Amen.
[2618.26 --> 2620.26]  Amen.
[2648.26 --> 2650.26]  Amen.
[2678.26 --> 2680.26]  Amen.
[2708.26 --> 2710.26]  Amen.
[2738.26 --> 2740.26]  Amen.
[2768.26 --> 2770.26]  Amen.
[2798.26 --> 2800.26]  Amen.
[2828.26 --> 2830.26]  Amen.
[2830.26 --> 2832.26]  Amen.
[2832.26 --> 2834.26]  Let's pray together.
[2834.26 --> 2841.26]  Gracious Heavenly Father, again we thank you that through Christ you invite us to come
[2841.26 --> 2842.26]  and commune with you.
[2842.26 --> 2848.26]  And Lord, we thank you for the spiritual nourishment that we receive through this sacrament.
[2848.26 --> 2854.26]  And we trust that you will use it, Lord, to help us to follow you, to walk more closely
[2854.26 --> 2858.26]  with you this week and as we leave from here later.
[2858.26 --> 2859.26]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2859.26 --> 2860.26]  Amen.
[2860.26 --> 2868.26]  So now, children, would you please come and join me right up here.
[2868.26 --> 2872.26]  And I want to share it with you.
[2872.26 --> 2878.26]  We'll be on this side today.
[2878.26 --> 2880.26]  Amen.
[2888.26 --> 2898.26]  How are you all today?
[2898.26 --> 2899.26]  Good?
[2899.26 --> 2900.26]  I have something to show you.
[2900.26 --> 2906.26]  I don't know if you have ever, I'd be curious, have you ever seen something like this?
[2906.26 --> 2907.26]  Do you know what this is?
[2907.26 --> 2908.26]  A map.
[2908.26 --> 2909.26]  What do you do with this?
[2909.26 --> 2910.26]  It shows you the way.
[2910.26 --> 2911.26]  It shows you the way.
[2911.26 --> 2912.26]  That's exactly right.
[2912.26 --> 2913.26]  It shows you the way.
[2913.26 --> 2915.26]  You know what I use nowadays?
[2915.26 --> 2916.26]  Google.
[2916.26 --> 2925.26]  But before we all had cell phones in our pockets, we used to use these things called maps.
[2925.26 --> 2932.26]  So if you wanted to say, go visit Whistler, and you lived in Ladner, what would you do?
[2932.26 --> 2935.26]  You'd have to get out a map and you'd have to find the road to take, right?
[2935.26 --> 2936.26]  So yeah, you're right.
[2936.26 --> 2939.26]  Maps show us the way, right?
[2939.26 --> 2940.26]  Yeah.
[2940.26 --> 2948.26]  So I want to read a passage from the Gospel of Matthew.
[2948.26 --> 2949.26]  Two verses.
[2949.26 --> 2950.26]  This is what it said.
[2950.26 --> 2960.26]  After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, during the time of...
[2960.26 --> 2962.26]  Okay, I'm going to start over.
[2962.26 --> 2966.26]  After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, right, that's what happened on Christmas, remember?
[2966.26 --> 2968.26]  Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
[2968.26 --> 2974.26]  In Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked,
[2974.26 --> 2977.26]  Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[2977.26 --> 2982.26]  We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
[2982.26 --> 2983.26]  Then it says,
[2983.26 --> 2989.26]  After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them
[2989.26 --> 2994.26]  until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[2994.26 --> 2998.26]  Because when they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[2998.26 --> 3001.26]  So Magi from the east...
[3001.26 --> 3002.26]  What is a Magi?
[3002.26 --> 3005.26]  They were like the really smart people of the day.
[3005.26 --> 3012.26]  They were the scholars, the philosophers, the scientists, and they wanted to go meet this newborn King Jesus.
[3012.26 --> 3014.26]  But they didn't live near Bethlehem.
[3014.26 --> 3016.26]  They lived very far away.
[3016.26 --> 3019.26]  So, and they didn't have one of these.
[3019.26 --> 3023.26]  Do you know, how did they find Jesus?
[3023.26 --> 3025.26]  Yeah, they followed the star.
[3025.26 --> 3026.26]  Okay.
[3026.26 --> 3031.26]  So we follow the map to find our way, and these Magi, they followed a star.
[3031.26 --> 3035.26]  God led them right to Jesus through a star.
[3035.26 --> 3039.26]  Now, are people still looking for Jesus today?
[3039.26 --> 3042.26]  What do you think?
[3042.26 --> 3045.26]  Where is Jesus still in Bethlehem?
[3045.26 --> 3047.26]  No, he's not there.
[3047.26 --> 3049.26]  Can't follow a star to find him.
[3049.26 --> 3051.26]  Where is Jesus now?
[3051.26 --> 3052.26]  Well, after he...
[3052.26 --> 3054.26]  In heaven, yeah.
[3054.26 --> 3055.26]  He rose from the dead.
[3055.26 --> 3058.26]  He ascended to heaven to be with God the Father.
[3058.26 --> 3061.26]  And so, what if you want to find Jesus today?
[3061.26 --> 3062.26]  Where's your map?
[3062.26 --> 3063.26]  Where do you look?
[3063.26 --> 3065.26]  Anybody know?
[3065.26 --> 3066.26]  Where?
[3068.26 --> 3069.26]  You're...
[3071.26 --> 3072.26]  You can't look.
[3072.26 --> 3073.26]  Okay.
[3073.26 --> 3075.26]  Well, then what do you do if you want to find Jesus?
[3075.26 --> 3077.26]  Who has an idea?
[3077.26 --> 3079.26]  I'll give you a clue.
[3080.26 --> 3081.26]  Yeah.
[3081.26 --> 3084.26]  The Bible is our map.
[3084.26 --> 3085.26]  Okay.
[3085.26 --> 3090.26]  The Bible shows us Jesus, and it shows us how to know and find Jesus.
[3090.26 --> 3091.26]  Okay?
[3091.26 --> 3096.26]  So, that's why I want you to remember today, that lots of people are still looking for Jesus,
[3096.26 --> 3102.26]  and if you're looking for Jesus, or your friends are looking for Jesus, the place to look to find him is in the Bible.
[3102.26 --> 3103.26]  Okay?
[3103.26 --> 3104.26]  Can you remember that?
[3104.26 --> 3105.26]  Okay.
[3105.26 --> 3106.26]  Let's pray together.
[3106.26 --> 3110.26]  Father, we thank you for your Bible that shows us the way to Jesus.
[3110.26 --> 3118.26]  And Lord, we pray that these children would seek him, and that they would find him.
[3118.26 --> 3119.26]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3119.26 --> 3120.26]  Amen.
[3120.26 --> 3121.26]  All right.
[3121.26 --> 3122.26]  Thanks for joining me up here.
[3122.26 --> 3123.26]  See ya.
[3123.26 --> 3124.26]  See ya.
[3124.26 --> 3125.26]  Oh, yes.
[3125.26 --> 3126.26]  Yeah.
[3126.26 --> 3127.26]  Thanks, Nancy.
[3127.26 --> 3130.26]  The Chinese group is dismissed also to go join Nancy in the first place.
[3130.26 --> 3143.26]  the fireside room for their service.
[3143.26 --> 3149.26]  And the youngest kids up to grade one are invited to go to the first place.
[3149.26 --> 3153.26]  And the youngest kids up to grade one are invited to go to the first place.
[3153.26 --> 3154.26]  the first place.
[3154.26 --> 3155.26]  The first place.
[3155.26 --> 3156.26]  The first place is the first place.
[3156.26 --> 3157.26]  All right.
[3157.26 --> 3158.26]  So today is another season in the church calendar.
[3158.26 --> 3159.26]  It's the first Sunday.
[3159.26 --> 3160.26]  We have been through Advent.
[3160.26 --> 3161.26]  We've been through Christmas.
[3161.26 --> 3175.26]  And this is the first Sunday in the season of Epiphany.
[3175.26 --> 3181.26]  This one might not be as familiar to us, but this is the season when the church around
[3181.26 --> 3188.26]  the world turns our attentions and looks to the life ministry and teaching of Jesus when
[3188.26 --> 3190.26]  he was on earth.
[3190.26 --> 3195.26]  And the way that we are going to do this, this Epiphany, the way we are going to look
[3195.26 --> 3201.26]  to Jesus and his teachings is through a sermon series on the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches
[3201.26 --> 3203.26]  us how to pray.
[3203.26 --> 3209.26]  So today we'll be reading Matthew chapter six, verses five to eight, where Jesus gives us some
[3209.26 --> 3213.26]  initial teachings about prayer for the Christian.
[3213.26 --> 3216.26]  So let's turn our attention to the reading of God's word.
[3216.26 --> 3218.26]  We'll read this passage together.
[3218.26 --> 3221.26]  Well, I'll read it for us.
[3221.26 --> 3228.26]  And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[3228.26 --> 3231.26]  and on the street corners to be seen by others.
[3231.26 --> 3236.26]  Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[3236.26 --> 3241.26]  But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.
[3241.26 --> 3246.26]  Then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
[3246.26 --> 3251.26]  And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard
[3251.26 --> 3253.26]  because of their many words.
[3253.26 --> 3260.26]  Do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him.
[3260.26 --> 3262.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3262.26 --> 3264.26]  Thanks be to God.
[3264.26 --> 3265.26]  Let's pray together again.
[3265.26 --> 3271.26]  Heavenly Father, now, as we hear your word, would you fill us by your spirit?
[3271.26 --> 3278.26]  Father, soften our hearts that we may see your ways and that we may follow you even more closely.
[3278.26 --> 3282.26]  We pray through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3282.26 --> 3283.26]  Amen.
[3283.26 --> 3292.26]  So I'll begin with this.
[3292.26 --> 3299.26]  In 1964, a famous writer named Flannery O'Connor, she was 21 years old.
[3299.26 --> 3303.26]  She was struggling in her writing career.
[3303.26 --> 3306.26]  She had just barely published one piece of writing.
[3306.26 --> 3309.26]  She was also struggling to pray.
[3309.26 --> 3314.26]  She began to journal her struggles with prayer.
[3314.26 --> 3316.26]  And here's what she writes in her journal.
[3316.26 --> 3319.26]  And she's, as she writes, she's writing prayers to God.
[3319.26 --> 3324.26]  And I want you to listen and see if anything of what she writes resonates with you.
[3324.26 --> 3329.26]  Can you also kind of feel the same things that she is feeling?
[3329.26 --> 3331.26]  So here's what she says in her journal.
[3331.26 --> 3339.26]  Dear God, I cannot love you the way I want to.
[3339.26 --> 3344.26]  You are the slim crescent of a moon that I see.
[3344.26 --> 3350.26]  And myself is the earth's shadow that keeps me from seeing all the moon.
[3350.26 --> 3353.26]  The crescent is very beautiful.
[3353.26 --> 3362.26]  But what I am afraid of, dear God, is that my self shadow will grow so large that it blocks the whole moon.
[3362.26 --> 3367.26]  I do not know you, God, because I am in the way.
[3367.26 --> 3374.26]  Please help me to push myself aside.
[3374.26 --> 3377.26]  So here's another journal entry.
[3377.26 --> 3384.26]  She writes, please help me to get down under things and find where you are.
[3384.26 --> 3390.26]  I do not mean to deny the traditional prayers I have said all my life.
[3390.26 --> 3396.26]  But I have been saying them and not feeling them.
[3396.26 --> 3403.26]  And lastly, she writes, can't anyone teach me how to pray?
[3403.26 --> 3407.26]  I think a lot of us can identify with Flannery O'Connor.
[3407.26 --> 3410.26]  We feel this desire to pray.
[3410.26 --> 3411.26]  We feel the need to pray.
[3411.26 --> 3412.26]  We want to know God.
[3412.26 --> 3413.26]  We want to see him.
[3413.26 --> 3416.26]  We want to find him, as she writes.
[3416.26 --> 3419.26]  And yet, we struggle with prayer.
[3419.26 --> 3425.26]  And there's even a sense where we feel like we must be doing it wrong.
[3425.26 --> 3427.26]  Because it's so hard.
[3427.26 --> 3433.26]  And because we find prayer so difficult, sometimes, well, we don't pray much.
[3433.26 --> 3436.26]  Or maybe not at all.
[3436.26 --> 3439.26]  And perhaps we don't really know how.
[3439.26 --> 3444.26]  So maybe for you this morning, you have the same question as Flannery O'Connor.
[3444.26 --> 3448.26]  Can't anyone teach me how to pray?
[3448.26 --> 3453.26]  But, you know, you're not the only one to ask this question, if that's your question this morning.
[3453.26 --> 3456.26]  O'Connor was not the only one to ask this question.
[3456.26 --> 3458.26]  Do you know who else asked that question?
[3458.26 --> 3460.26]  Teach us to pray.
[3460.26 --> 3463.26]  Jesus' disciples.
[3463.26 --> 3464.26]  Right?
[3464.26 --> 3468.26]  Jesus would often go off to pray to his Father.
[3468.26 --> 3474.26]  And his disciples who were following him, they see Jesus go and spend this time in prayer.
[3474.26 --> 3476.26]  Seeing that he needed to pray.
[3476.26 --> 3478.26]  He needed to be with his Father.
[3478.26 --> 3481.26]  And that Jesus prayed like no one else ever did.
[3481.26 --> 3484.26]  Totally different from all the other Jewish leaders.
[3484.26 --> 3488.26]  And so, they see the strength that he gains.
[3488.26 --> 3490.26]  The calmness.
[3490.26 --> 3493.26]  The confidence that he gains through prayer.
[3493.26 --> 3499.26]  So they ask him, Lord, teach us to pray.
[3499.26 --> 3505.26]  So Jesus teaches them the simple yet breathtaking prayer that we know as the Lord's Prayer.
[3505.26 --> 3509.26]  And Christians have been praying this prayer ever since.
[3509.26 --> 3513.26]  Not only the actual words of the prayer, but all that those words mean.
[3513.26 --> 3517.26]  And taking this as a model and making it their own.
[3517.26 --> 3520.26]  Through that learning how to pray to God.
[3520.26 --> 3524.26]  And so that's what we hope to do together over the next several weeks.
[3524.26 --> 3527.26]  Is we're going to be studying the Lord's Prayer together.
[3527.26 --> 3528.26]  Taking it line by line.
[3528.26 --> 3530.26]  Petition by petition.
[3530.26 --> 3535.26]  But today is more of an introduction to how Jesus talks about prayer.
[3535.26 --> 3539.26]  Jesus offers some preliminary thoughts for us.
[3539.26 --> 3542.26]  And so before teaching us how to pray in the Lord's Prayer.
[3542.26 --> 3547.26]  Jesus tells us two really important things about prayer that we need to know.
[3547.26 --> 3553.26]  He tells us that we have a Heavenly Father who sees.
[3553.26 --> 3557.26]  And that we have a Father who knows what we need.
[3557.26 --> 3560.26]  And friends, that changes absolutely everything about prayer.
[3560.26 --> 3563.26]  That is what makes Christian prayer.
[3563.26 --> 3566.26]  That we have a Father who sees us.
[3566.26 --> 3568.26]  And we have a Father who knows us.
[3568.26 --> 3570.26]  So let's look at what Jesus says here.
[3570.26 --> 3574.26]  First, Jesus tells us that we have a Father who sees.
[3574.26 --> 3577.26]  So look with me at verse 5.
[3577.26 --> 3578.26]  He says,
[3578.26 --> 3581.26]  And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites.
[3581.26 --> 3585.26]  For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners.
[3585.26 --> 3588.26]  To be seen by others.
[3588.26 --> 3590.26]  So Jesus starts off by saying this.
[3590.26 --> 3593.26]  He actually tells us two ways not to pray.
[3593.26 --> 3595.26]  How not to pray.
[3595.26 --> 3600.26]  He says, if you want to learn how to pray, don't look to the hypocrites.
[3600.26 --> 3601.26]  Now what does that mean?
[3601.26 --> 3607.26]  Because this original word for hypocrite, it wasn't derogatory like it is for us today.
[3607.26 --> 3610.26]  It simply meant a person who worked in the theater.
[3610.26 --> 3612.26]  A hypocrite was an actor.
[3612.26 --> 3616.26]  And we don't call actors hypocrites, do we?
[3616.26 --> 3619.26]  I mean, not for being an actor at least.
[3619.26 --> 3622.26]  Because we understand what they're doing.
[3622.26 --> 3623.26]  Right?
[3623.26 --> 3628.26]  If you're an actor, well, it's your job to pretend to be someone who you are not.
[3628.26 --> 3630.26]  If you're an actor, that's okay.
[3630.26 --> 3632.26]  Actually, you want to do a good job at it.
[3632.26 --> 3637.26]  We don't think of them as insincere for what they do.
[3637.26 --> 3642.26]  The problem is when we leave the stage, when we walk out of the theater,
[3642.26 --> 3648.26]  we begin to play a role like an actor would in our real lives.
[3648.26 --> 3650.26]  And so that's the problem.
[3650.26 --> 3655.26]  Now why do the hypocrites here stand on the street corners and pray in the synagogue?
[3655.26 --> 3657.26]  It says they love to pray.
[3657.26 --> 3658.26]  That's good.
[3658.26 --> 3660.26]  They love to pray, it says.
[3660.26 --> 3662.26]  But unfortunately, what do they love?
[3662.26 --> 3665.26]  Well, it's not prayer that they love.
[3665.26 --> 3669.26]  And it's not the God that they're pretending to pray to that they love.
[3669.26 --> 3674.26]  What they love, it says, is the chance to be seen.
[3674.26 --> 3678.26]  They love the applause and the admiration of others.
[3678.26 --> 3681.26]  That's why they go to the street corners.
[3681.26 --> 3685.26]  And that's what it means to be a hypocrite, Jesus is saying.
[3685.26 --> 3691.26]  Jesus has in mind here people who make a great outward show of piety.
[3691.26 --> 3698.26]  That they look really good on the outside, but it doesn't correspond to their hearts.
[3698.26 --> 3701.26]  I mean, on the one hand, that's all of us, aren't we?
[3701.26 --> 3707.26]  We all desire to be who God has called us to be.
[3707.26 --> 3713.26]  And sometimes we even end up showing it more than where we really are and our hearts need to catch up.
[3713.26 --> 3719.26]  And so this was a problem in Jesus' day, and it's still a problem in our day as well.
[3719.26 --> 3724.26]  You know, and the reason it's a problem in our day is because our hearts are still the same.
[3724.26 --> 3730.26]  They're the same as these ancient people in Jesus' day.
[3730.26 --> 3735.26]  In all of our hearts is the desire to be seen.
[3735.26 --> 3742.26]  In all of our hearts is the desire to be recognized, to be acknowledged, to be noticed.
[3742.26 --> 3747.26]  And we will even sometimes use religious activities to meet this desire that we have.
[3747.26 --> 3753.26]  So that means then, friends, it's possible to go to church, to come and worship God.
[3753.26 --> 3764.26]  It's possible to spend time reading the Bible and praying and giving our offerings for the same wrongheaded reason that took these hypocrites to the street corner.
[3764.26 --> 3768.26]  Which is not out of love for God, but in order to be seen.
[3768.26 --> 3777.26]  And so Jesus says to his disciples, don't be like the religious hypocrites who only pray to be seen.
[3777.26 --> 3780.26]  That's not what prayer is all about.
[3780.26 --> 3787.26]  So then he says in verse 5, truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[3787.26 --> 3788.26]  Right?
[3788.26 --> 3794.26]  In other words, what they most desired in prayer was to be seen and noticed by other people.
[3794.26 --> 3798.26]  Well, they got it, but tragically that's all they get.
[3798.26 --> 3799.26]  Right?
[3799.26 --> 3804.26]  They miss out on the reward of their Heavenly Father, which is to be seen and accepted by God.
[3806.26 --> 3808.26]  So here's the question, how do we pray?
[3808.26 --> 3809.26]  Right?
[3809.26 --> 3810.26]  How do we approach God?
[3810.26 --> 3811.26]  Not like the hypocrite.
[3811.26 --> 3812.26]  Well, then how?
[3812.26 --> 3815.26]  Well, Jesus goes on and tells us in verse 6,
[3815.26 --> 3832.26]  Jesus tells us when you pray, you are seen.
[3832.26 --> 3834.26]  You are seen.
[3834.26 --> 3836.26]  Okay, God sees you.
[3836.26 --> 3839.26]  You don't need the attention of other people.
[3839.26 --> 3847.26]  You don't need their applause because you have the attention of your Heavenly Father, the God of the universe.
[3847.26 --> 3851.26]  You have an audience and he accepts you already.
[3851.26 --> 3857.26]  So if you are his child through faith in Christ, that through prayer you can be with your Heavenly Father.
[3857.26 --> 3860.26]  You can spend time in his presence.
[3860.26 --> 3863.26]  That is the amazing reward of prayer.
[3863.26 --> 3865.26]  That God sees you.
[3865.26 --> 3868.26]  You can come to him freely.
[3868.26 --> 3873.26]  He invites you into this secret place, the place where he is.
[3873.26 --> 3878.26]  And he invites you just to dwell with him, to commune with him.
[3878.26 --> 3883.26]  So what does it look like for us to resist hypocritical prayers?
[3883.26 --> 3889.26]  Here are just two practical things for us to consider that arise from what Jesus says here.
[3889.26 --> 3893.26]  First, when we are honest with our prayers, what it means is that we can be ourselves.
[3893.26 --> 3901.26]  Okay, in prayer, all of us can try to more just be ourselves.
[3901.26 --> 3907.26]  Now, that doesn't mean we can't be more reverent than we normally are.
[3907.26 --> 3909.26]  Maybe we should be, right?
[3909.26 --> 3914.26]  We wouldn't necessarily talk to God the way we would talk to our kids or a friend or someone else.
[3914.26 --> 3918.26]  You know, it's okay to be more reverent in our hearts and in our words.
[3918.26 --> 3919.26]  That's fine.
[3919.26 --> 3922.26]  But we don't need to speak differently from what we normally do.
[3922.26 --> 3929.26]  We don't need to kind of look to someone else in the way they pray and kind of copy the way they do it.
[3929.26 --> 3932.26]  We don't need to adopt a different personality in prayer.
[3932.26 --> 3936.26]  We're not trying to be someone else or put on any sort of show.
[3936.26 --> 3941.26]  Jesus is saying, don't act like someone else.
[3941.26 --> 3943.26]  Pray like yourself.
[3943.26 --> 3945.26]  Pray like who you are.
[3945.26 --> 3947.26]  Talk to him like he's really there.
[3947.26 --> 3950.26]  He wants to be with you.
[3950.26 --> 3951.26]  You in particular.
[3951.26 --> 3953.26]  You for who he has made you to be.
[3953.26 --> 3956.26]  You don't need to be someone else.
[3956.26 --> 3961.26]  Second, we can resist hypocritical prayer by making sure that we pray in private.
[3961.26 --> 3962.26]  Right?
[3962.26 --> 3964.26]  That doesn't mean that you can't pray publicly.
[3964.26 --> 3965.26]  Jesus did.
[3965.26 --> 3968.26]  I mean, we pray together as we gather.
[3968.26 --> 3970.26]  We are instructed to in the scriptures.
[3970.26 --> 3975.26]  And it doesn't mean that you can't pray together with other believers.
[3975.26 --> 3978.26]  That's also a huge blessing that we have.
[3978.26 --> 3984.26]  But if you only ever find yourself praying in public.
[3984.26 --> 3985.26]  Right?
[3985.26 --> 3989.26]  If you're only praying at the family dinner table.
[3989.26 --> 3992.26]  Or if you're only praying at church and Bible studies.
[3992.26 --> 3993.26]  Or maybe for you kids.
[3993.26 --> 3996.26]  If you're only praying with your parents.
[3996.26 --> 3997.26]  Or if you're praying to God.
[3997.26 --> 4001.26]  The invitation here is to spend time praying to God on your own.
[4001.26 --> 4002.26]  Right?
[4002.26 --> 4006.26]  He welcomes you to meet with him in prayer.
[4006.26 --> 4007.26]  He welcomes you.
[4007.26 --> 4008.26]  He invites you.
[4008.26 --> 4013.26]  He desires for you to come before him.
[4013.26 --> 4014.26]  Open up your heart to him.
[4014.26 --> 4015.26]  And talk to him.
[4015.26 --> 4018.26]  So that's the first thing Jesus says here about prayer.
[4018.26 --> 4020.26]  That you have a father who sees you.
[4020.26 --> 4021.26]  He accepts you.
[4021.26 --> 4023.26]  And so you can pray to him.
[4023.26 --> 4026.26]  Now the second thing we see.
[4026.26 --> 4027.26]  Not only does God see us.
[4027.26 --> 4030.26]  He also knows just what we need.
[4030.26 --> 4034.26]  Look again with me at what Jesus says in verse 7.
[4034.26 --> 4037.26]  And when you pray do not keep on babbling like the pagans.
[4037.26 --> 4041.26]  For they think they will be heard because of their many words.
[4041.26 --> 4046.26]  See the people of the Greco-Roman world worship lots of different gods.
[4046.26 --> 4051.26]  And these pagan gods were often seen as just not that interested.
[4051.26 --> 4054.26]  In what is going on in human affairs.
[4054.26 --> 4055.26]  Right?
[4055.26 --> 4056.26]  They just weren't paying attention.
[4056.26 --> 4058.26]  They had their own things to worry about.
[4058.26 --> 4061.26]  And because their gods didn't actually care about them.
[4061.26 --> 4064.26]  At the heart of pagan prayer.
[4064.26 --> 4067.26]  Is this babbling kind of prayer.
[4067.26 --> 4072.26]  And what is behind that is the belief that the more they say.
[4072.26 --> 4076.26]  The more likely it is that their God that they are praying to.
[4076.26 --> 4078.26]  Will hear their prayer and answer it.
[4079.26 --> 4083.26]  Perhaps a lot of us have a similar kind of expectation.
[4083.26 --> 4089.26]  That God answering our prayers in the affirmative depends on saying more.
[4089.26 --> 4092.26]  But Jesus says you have a father who hears you.
[4092.26 --> 4093.26]  Right?
[4093.26 --> 4095.26]  He hears all of your prayers.
[4095.26 --> 4097.26]  He hears it the first time.
[4097.26 --> 4098.26]  And the hundredth time.
[4098.26 --> 4100.26]  He is always listening.
[4100.26 --> 4101.26]  Right?
[4101.26 --> 4104.26]  You always have his attention.
[4104.26 --> 4105.26]  Right?
[4105.26 --> 4112.26]  You don't need to say certain magical phrases a specific number of times.
[4112.26 --> 4114.26]  To get him to pay attention.
[4114.26 --> 4116.26]  Where he said oh he said the right thing.
[4116.26 --> 4118.26]  And he said it the 560 second time.
[4118.26 --> 4119.26]  Okay.
[4119.26 --> 4120.26]  I'm listening.
[4120.26 --> 4121.26]  Right?
[4121.26 --> 4122.26]  It's not like that.
[4122.26 --> 4123.26]  You can just talk to him.
[4123.26 --> 4124.26]  He's listening.
[4124.26 --> 4126.26]  His face is toward.
[4126.26 --> 4127.26]  Turn toward you.
[4127.26 --> 4129.26]  His ear is inclined to you.
[4131.26 --> 4135.26]  Now Jesus isn't saying that we shouldn't repeat ourselves.
[4135.26 --> 4136.26]  Right?
[4136.26 --> 4139.26]  He taught his disciples to be persistent in prayer.
[4139.26 --> 4143.26]  And he's not saying that we shouldn't pray long prayers.
[4143.26 --> 4148.26]  Jesus often would go and spend hours at a time with his father in prayer.
[4149.26 --> 4154.26]  But prayer based on the faulty belief that the more words we say the better.
[4154.26 --> 4156.26]  Just for the sake of getting God's attention.
[4156.26 --> 4158.26]  Is a misunderstanding of God.
[4158.26 --> 4160.26]  Jesus says he hears.
[4160.26 --> 4162.26]  That's what he says in verse 8.
[4162.26 --> 4164.26]  That's not what God is like at all.
[4164.26 --> 4169.26]  God is a father who knows what we need even before we ask him.
[4171.26 --> 4176.26]  In other words you aren't heard by God because you can successfully annoy him.
[4176.26 --> 4179.26]  Or because you've hit the magical number of times.
[4179.26 --> 4180.26]  Right?
[4180.26 --> 4181.26]  You are.
[4181.26 --> 4182.26]  Why are you heard by God?
[4182.26 --> 4184.26]  Because he's your heavenly father.
[4184.26 --> 4185.26]  Right?
[4185.26 --> 4190.26]  You have a heavenly father who knows what you need.
[4190.26 --> 4193.26]  He knows what's going on in your life.
[4193.26 --> 4195.26]  He knows every passion that you have.
[4195.26 --> 4197.26]  Every pain in your heart.
[4197.26 --> 4201.26]  He knows every desire and every longing that you have.
[4201.26 --> 4203.26]  And that you bring to him.
[4203.26 --> 4209.26]  And he cares way more about you than you even care about yourself.
[4209.26 --> 4214.26]  Now maybe we've asked this question before.
[4214.26 --> 4217.26]  Well if God knows what I need even before I ask.
[4217.26 --> 4219.26]  Then why pray?
[4219.26 --> 4220.26]  Right?
[4220.26 --> 4221.26]  What's the point of prayer?
[4221.26 --> 4223.26]  If God already knows why pray?
[4223.26 --> 4225.26]  I love what John Calvin says.
[4225.26 --> 4226.26]  I want to share this quote with you.
[4226.26 --> 4228.26]  I think it's really helpful.
[4228.26 --> 4230.26]  This is what he says.
[4230.26 --> 4240.26]  The believers do not pray with the view of informing God about things that are unknown to him.
[4240.26 --> 4243.26]  Or of exciting him to do his duty.
[4243.26 --> 4247.26]  Or of urging him as though he were reluctant.
[4247.26 --> 4254.26]  On the contrary, they pray in order that they may arouse themselves to seek him.
[4254.26 --> 4259.26]  That they may relieve themselves from their anxieties by pouring them into his bosom.
[4259.26 --> 4272.26]  In a word, that they may declare that from him alone they hope and expect, both for themselves and others, all good things.
[4272.26 --> 4273.26]  Right?
[4273.26 --> 4275.26]  We pray even when God knows what we need.
[4275.26 --> 4276.26]  Why?
[4276.26 --> 4280.26]  Because that is how we can seek God.
[4280.26 --> 4285.26]  It is how we can grow in our trust in his care and his goodness for us.
[4286.26 --> 4291.26]  So how can we avoid this babbling kind of prayer that Jesus talks about here?
[4291.26 --> 4293.26]  Well, two things.
[4293.26 --> 4296.26]  First, it's about reorienting our view of God.
[4296.26 --> 4301.26]  God is a good father and he hears us.
[4301.26 --> 4302.26]  Right?
[4302.26 --> 4303.26]  He is attentive to us.
[4303.26 --> 4307.26]  So when we come before God in prayer, that's the view we have to have of God.
[4307.26 --> 4308.26]  That he is a heavenly father.
[4308.26 --> 4310.26]  That he is listening to us.
[4310.26 --> 4316.26]  And then, you know, next week as we enter into the Lord's Prayer and we look at the first line, our Father in Heaven,
[4316.26 --> 4319.26]  we'll talk more about what it means to pray to God as our heavenly Father.
[4319.26 --> 4330.26]  But secondly, I think part of the solution to a babbling kind of prayer is actually just deciding to pray less when we pray, to say less when we pray.
[4330.26 --> 4333.26]  In fact, Ecclesiastes says something about this.
[4333.26 --> 4341.26]  It says, God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.
[4341.26 --> 4342.26]  Right?
[4342.26 --> 4350.26]  It's possible that the longer we try to stretch our prayers, the more likely it is that we are babbling.
[4350.26 --> 4351.26]  Right?
[4351.26 --> 4354.26]  And so don't worry about stretches of silence when you pray.
[4354.26 --> 4358.26]  When you come before God in prayer, you can sit in silence.
[4358.26 --> 4359.26]  He knows your heart.
[4359.26 --> 4360.26]  Right?
[4360.26 --> 4362.26]  Sometimes we come, we don't know what to say.
[4362.26 --> 4366.26]  We can just say, God, I want to pray to you and just come into his presence.
[4366.26 --> 4369.26]  Give it some time.
[4369.26 --> 4371.26]  And then let the words come naturally.
[4371.26 --> 4372.26]  Right?
[4372.26 --> 4374.26]  And don't worry about short prayers.
[4374.26 --> 4377.26]  Sometimes, you know, my favorite prayer is, Lord, help me.
[4377.26 --> 4378.26]  That's it.
[4378.26 --> 4381.26]  I say it many times during the day.
[4381.26 --> 4383.26]  Big situations and small.
[4383.26 --> 4384.26]  Lord, help me.
[4384.26 --> 4385.26]  Right?
[4385.26 --> 4393.26]  We think of Nehemiah who came before the king and expressed his, the king asked, what can I do for you?
[4393.26 --> 4395.26]  And he says, he prayed to God and answered the king.
[4395.26 --> 4397.26]  How long did it take him to pray to God?
[4397.26 --> 4398.26]  Like 10 seconds?
[4398.26 --> 4399.26]  Five seconds?
[4399.26 --> 4400.26]  Less?
[4400.26 --> 4401.26]  Two?
[4401.26 --> 4402.26]  I don't know.
[4402.26 --> 4403.26]  Some prayers can be short.
[4403.26 --> 4404.26]  It's okay.
[4404.26 --> 4405.26]  We can spend long hours in prayer.
[4405.26 --> 4407.26]  Prayers can be short.
[4407.26 --> 4408.26]  There's no rules.
[4408.26 --> 4410.26]  But we don't need to babble.
[4410.26 --> 4412.26]  Because God hears us.
[4412.26 --> 4414.26]  So God knows what you need.
[4414.26 --> 4415.26]  He hears you.
[4415.26 --> 4416.26]  He sees you.
[4416.26 --> 4421.26]  He invites you into a relationship with him where you can just lift up your hearts to him in prayer.
[4421.26 --> 4424.26]  And I love how Martin Luther puts it.
[4424.26 --> 4427.26]  We're hitting all of the reformers today.
[4427.26 --> 4430.26]  He says, this is what he says, talking about this passage.
[4430.26 --> 4433.26]  The Gentiles, so pagan or Gentile.
[4433.26 --> 4440.26]  The Gentile delusion is that prayer meant making both God and oneself tired with yelling and murmuring.
[4440.26 --> 4443.26]  But the Christian's prayer is easy.
[4443.26 --> 4445.26]  And it does not cause hard work.
[4445.26 --> 4447.26]  It presents its need from the heart.
[4447.26 --> 4453.26]  So when we pray, we have a Father who sees us.
[4453.26 --> 4454.26]  He knows what we need.
[4454.26 --> 4457.26]  We can present our needs from our hearts.
[4457.26 --> 4460.26]  And finally, what should we pray for?
[4460.26 --> 4462.26]  What is the Lord's Prayer all about?
[4462.26 --> 4466.26]  And again, you know, we're going to be entering into it and looking petition by petition.
[4466.26 --> 4472.26]  But I do just want to share a couple of overarching thoughts before we get into the details today.
[4472.26 --> 4478.26]  The first is when considering the Lord's Prayer, picture it like playing the scales when practicing an instrument.
[4478.26 --> 4481.26]  I don't know how many of you play an instrument.
[4481.26 --> 4486.26]  When I was a kid, I played the piano very badly for a couple of years.
[4486.26 --> 4487.26]  I don't anymore.
[4487.26 --> 4492.26]  But one thing I know is that you never get past playing the scales, do you?
[4492.26 --> 4493.26]  Right?
[4493.26 --> 4499.26]  You don't sort of learn the scales and then done with that and I get to move on to other things.
[4499.26 --> 4500.26]  Right?
[4500.26 --> 4504.26]  The scales are the foundation for every kind of music that can then be played.
[4504.26 --> 4506.26]  We have to master that first.
[4506.26 --> 4511.26]  And in a similar way, when it comes to the Lord's Prayer, it's not the beginning prayer where it's like,
[4511.26 --> 4512.26]  Okay, I learned the Lord's Prayer.
[4512.26 --> 4513.26]  Now I'm going to move on.
[4513.26 --> 4514.26]  What's Paul teach?
[4514.26 --> 4516.26]  Maybe you have something more advanced for me now.
[4516.26 --> 4525.26]  No, the Lord's Prayer is like the basic scales and the chords that you can then use to build on and to improvise.
[4525.26 --> 4528.26]  So it's not a prayer just to be repeated mindlessly.
[4528.26 --> 4531.26]  It's not like we're going to go and say, 10 Our Fathers.
[4531.26 --> 4537.26]  It's an ordering of the world that gives us these categories in which to think.
[4537.26 --> 4541.26]  And they serve as a guide for our entire life of prayer.
[4541.26 --> 4546.26]  So praying the Lord's Prayer, think about it as like practicing the scales of an instrument.
[4546.26 --> 4548.26]  We have to learn all of our scales.
[4548.26 --> 4560.26]  Secondly, I think it's helpful to consider the Lord's Prayer as a whole as learning how to pray for the restoration and renewal of the whole world, everything that is ruined by sin and by evil.
[4560.26 --> 4566.26]  Scripture tells us that there is a crack in everything.
[4566.26 --> 4571.26]  That everything in the world has been ruined and damaged and broken by sin.
[4571.26 --> 4573.26]  Sin has invaded our own hearts.
[4573.26 --> 4576.26]  It has caused us to seek and build our own kingdoms.
[4576.26 --> 4579.26]  It causes us to sin against others.
[4579.26 --> 4581.26]  It causes need and hunger in the world.
[4581.26 --> 4583.26]  And it alienates us from God.
[4583.26 --> 4589.26]  And the Lord's Prayer can be understood as asking God to heal everything that has gone wrong.
[4589.26 --> 4592.26]  Because it's asking for a restored relationship with God.
[4592.26 --> 4597.26]  It's also asking for healing of our own hearts.
[4597.26 --> 4601.26]  It's asking for our greed to be mended so that everyone can eat.
[4601.26 --> 4606.26]  It's asking for the presence and power of sin and Satan to be diminished.
[4606.26 --> 4618.26]  In every area of life, the Lord's Prayer is sort of helping us to push back against the evil in the world and praying for the world to be mended and repaired.
[4618.26 --> 4621.26]  So, the Lord's Prayer is like playing the scales.
[4621.26 --> 4625.26]  It's learning how to pray for all things in the world to be mended.
[4625.26 --> 4632.26]  And finally, the only way that we can pray this prayer is if Jesus Christ is real and if he is at work in the world.
[4632.26 --> 4642.26]  Friends, if Jesus is not actively at work in the world through the Spirit in his people, then the Lord's Prayer is just a wish.
[4642.26 --> 4647.26]  It's wishful thinking, not a prayer.
[4647.26 --> 4652.26]  But as we will explore, it is Christ who makes this prayer possible.
[4652.26 --> 4658.26]  Jesus prayed this prayer, every part probably except for, of course, forgive us our sins.
[4658.26 --> 4664.26]  But he prayed that he would forgive others, didn't he?
[4664.26 --> 4665.26]  He prayed all of these things.
[4665.26 --> 4666.26]  He lived out this prayer.
[4666.26 --> 4667.26]  He embodied this prayer.
[4667.26 --> 4671.26]  He accomplished this prayer for us so that we can pray it.
[4671.26 --> 4673.26]  And he will do it.
[4673.26 --> 4677.26]  So, when you pray, friends, follow these dance steps.
[4677.26 --> 4679.26]  Learn these scales.
[4679.26 --> 4684.26]  And let's learn together how to ask for the world that God longs to bring.
[4684.26 --> 4686.26]  Let's pray together.
[4686.26 --> 4699.26]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for the freedom, the joy, the grace, the mercy that we can talk to you.
[4699.26 --> 4701.26]  That you hear us.
[4701.26 --> 4703.26]  That you speak to us in prayer.
[4703.26 --> 4712.26]  Father, we, like Flannery O'Connor, like the disciples, Lord, teach us how to pray.
[4712.26 --> 4715.26]  Lord, we don't want to get in our own way.
[4715.26 --> 4717.26]  But we want to see you and know you.
[4717.26 --> 4719.26]  Lord, would you teach us?
[4719.26 --> 4720.26]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4720.26 --> 4721.26]  Amen.
[4721.26 --> 4722.26]  God, that's great.
[4722.26 --> 4723.26]  You've found this prayer.
[4723.26 --> 4724.26] ifting that don't raise money.
[4724.26 --> 4725.26]  Thank you.
[4725.26 --> 4726.26]  We love you.
[4726.26 --> 4728.26] érieur given �estä One."
[4728.26 --> 4730.26]  Okay, so let's sing our hymn of response together.
[4730.26 --> 4731.26]  Would you please stand?
[4731.26 --> 4733.26]  Amen.
[4761.26 --> 4763.26]  Amen.
[4791.26 --> 4793.26]  Amen.
[4821.26 --> 4833.74]  I have a father, he calls me his own.
[4836.24 --> 4846.20]  He'll never leave me, no matter where I go.
[4846.20 --> 4860.20]  He knows my name, he knows my every thought.
[4860.20 --> 4871.20]  He sees his ear that falls, and hears me when I go.
[4871.20 --> 4885.20]  He knows my name, he knows my every thought.
[4885.20 --> 4897.20]  He sees me still, he falls, and hears me when I go.
[4897.20 --> 4907.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4907.20 --> 4909.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4909.20 --> 4911.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4911.20 --> 4913.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4913.20 --> 4943.20] 
[4943.20 --> 4973.20] 
[4973.20 --> 4975.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4975.20 --> 4977.20]  He hears me when I go.
[4977.20 --> 4979.20]  He hears me when I go.
