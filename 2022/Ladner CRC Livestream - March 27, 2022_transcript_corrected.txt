[1251.98 → 1260.40] Remember how His mercy reached, and we cried out to Him
[1260.40 → 1269.40] He lifted us to solid ground, to freedom from our sin
[1269.40 → 1277.82] Oh sing my soul, and tell all He's done
[1277.82 → 1283.82] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1283.82 → 1294.40] Live high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord
[1294.40 → 1302.82] His power in us is greater than, is greater than this world
[1302.82 → 1310.82] To share the reason for our hope, to serve with love and grace
[1310.82 → 1316.24] That all would see Him shine through us
[1316.24 → 1319.24] I pray that Father brings
[1319.24 → 1328.24] Oh sing my soul, and tell all He's done
[1328.24 → 1334.24] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1334.24 → 1344.66] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our light
[1344.66 → 1345.44] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our light
[1345.44 → 1353.74] No other name on earth can sing and praise us so to life
[1353.74 → 1361.36] He opens up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown
[1361.36 → 1370.46] We labour in His fields of grace, as He leads save earth's hope
[1370.46 → 1378.58] Oh sing my soul, and tell all He's done
[1378.58 → 1384.00] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[1384.00 → 1402.96] At this time the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes
[1402.96 → 1420.00] And we will continue our worship here this morning
[1420.00 → 1421.78] With a time of confession
[1421.78 → 1424.78] And we will begin actually a little bit differently
[1424.78 → 1429.52] With a scripture reading that will serve as a call to confession
[1429.52 → 1435.36] So this is from Numbers 21 verses 4-9
[1435.36 → 1441.26] They travelled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea
[1441.26 → 1443.38] To go around Edom
[1443.38 → 1447.52] But the people grew impatient on the way
[1447.52 → 1451.08] They spoke against God and against Moses
[1451.08 → 1454.50] And said, why have you brought us up out of Egypt
[1454.50 → 1456.42] To die in the wilderness?
[1456.42 → 1458.64] There is no bread
[1458.64 → 1460.44] There is no water
[1460.44 → 1463.64] And we detest this miserable food
[1463.64 → 1467.98] Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them
[1467.98 → 1470.58] They bit the people and many Israelites died
[1470.58 → 1473.36] The people came to Moses and said
[1473.36 → 1477.26] We have sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you
[1477.26 → 1481.16] Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us
[1481.16 → 1484.52] So Moses prayed for the people
[1484.52 → 1487.30] The Lord said to Moses
[1487.30 → 1489.70] Make a snake and put it up on a pole
[1489.70 → 1493.72] Anyone who is bitten can look at it and live
[1493.72 → 1496.84] So Moses made a bronze snake
[1496.84 → 1498.56] And put it up on a pole
[1498.56 → 1501.54] Then when anyone was bitten by a snake
[1501.54 → 1503.46] And looked at the bronze snake
[1503.46 → 1504.74] They lived
[1504.74 → 1506.94] This is God's word
[1506.94 → 1512.08] So we come now and let's use this call to confession
[1512.08 → 1516.22] To inform our own confession before the Lord
[1516.22 → 1517.52] And we'll say this responsibly
[1517.52 → 1521.16] Oh Lord, we are often impatient
[1521.16 → 1523.20] Like the people of Israel
[1523.20 → 1526.12] We want things our way
[1526.12 → 1528.40] And we want them in a hurry
[1528.40 → 1532.98] Forgive us when we think this way
[1532.98 → 1534.40] Or say it out loud
[1534.40 → 1536.96] Lord, we are sinful
[1536.96 → 1539.46] Please take away our sin
[1539.46 → 1542.12] Help us to follow your ways
[1542.12 → 1543.80] In Jesus' name
[1543.80 → 1544.86] Amen
[1544.86 → 1548.44] Now hear these words of assurance
[1548.44 → 1549.96] From John chapter 3
[1549.96 → 1554.24] Just as Moses lifted the snake in the wilderness
[1554.24 → 1558.00] So the Son of Man must be lifted
[1558.00 → 1560.22] That everyone who believes
[1560.22 → 1562.52] May have eternal life in him
[1562.52 → 1564.64] Thanks be to God
[1564.64 → 1567.76] Those who have been forgiven
[1567.76 → 1571.08] As we look to our Christ
[1571.08 → 1572.48] Our lifted Christ
[1572.48 → 1574.80] Because of what he has done for us
[1574.80 → 1575.54] Let's stand
[1575.54 → 1576.38] And let's sing
[1576.38 → 1577.56] A song of response
[1577.56 → 1579.36] A song of gratitude and praise
[1579.36 → 1580.32] To our Saviour
[1580.32 → 1582.28] Let's stand
[1582.28 → 1593.66] Praise the Lord
[1593.66 → 1598.66] His mercy is born
[1598.66 → 1603.06] Stronger the darkness
[1603.06 → 1605.46] New every morn
[1605.46 → 1608.22] Our sins they are many
[1608.22 → 1610.60] His mercy is born
[1610.60 → 1622.92] Stronger than darkness
[1622.92 → 1625.40] New every morn
[1625.40 → 1628.18] Our sins they are many
[1628.18 → 1630.98] His mercy is born
[1630.98 → 1634.56] What love could remember
[1634.56 → 1637.16] No wrongs we have done
[1637.16 → 1640.36] On his still knowing
[1640.36 → 1642.94] He counts on their song
[1642.94 → 1645.74] Thrown into a sea
[1645.74 → 1648.78] With a bottom or shore
[1648.78 → 1652.82] Our sins they are many
[1652.82 → 1655.98] His mercy is born
[1655.98 → 1667.36] What patience would wake
[1667.36 → 1670.22] As we constantly roam
[1670.22 → 1673.12] What father so tender
[1673.12 → 1676.00] Is calling us home
[1676.00 → 1678.94] He welcomes the weakest
[1678.94 → 1680.62] The vilest
[1680.62 → 1682.46] The poor
[1682.46 → 1685.78] Our sins they are many
[1685.78 → 1688.84] His mercy is born
[1688.84 → 1691.84] Praise the Lord
[1691.84 → 1697.84] His mercy is born
[1697.84 → 1703.22] Stronger than darkness
[1703.22 → 1705.62] New every morn
[1705.62 → 1708.48] Our sins they are many
[1708.48 → 1709.86] His mercy is born
[1709.86 → 1710.86] His mercy is born
[1710.86 → 1711.86] His mercy is born
[1711.86 → 1712.86] His mercy is born
[1712.86 → 1713.86] His mercy is born
[1713.86 → 1717.86] His mercy is born
[1717.86 → 1723.86] Stronger than darkness
[1723.86 → 1724.86] New every morn
[1724.86 → 1729.86] Our sins they are many
[1729.86 → 1730.86] His mercy is born
[1730.86 → 1734.16] His mercy is born
[1734.16 → 1736.48] What riches of kindness
[1736.48 → 1739.52] He lavished on us
[1739.52 → 1743.88] His blood was the payment
[1743.88 → 1745.24] His life was the cost
[1745.24 → 1746.24] Our sins they are many
[1746.24 → 1750.24] His mercy is born
[1750.24 → 1757.88] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is born.
[1757.88 → 1767.00] Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[1769.28 → 1773.94] Stronger than darkness, new every morn.
[1774.40 → 1779.18] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is born.
[1779.18 → 1786.72] Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[1790.00 → 1794.74] Stronger than darkness, new every morn.
[1795.18 → 1800.60] Our sins, they are many, His mercy is born.
[1809.18 → 1810.58] Amen.
[1824.46 → 1833.54] Our scripture reading is Mark 15, 33 through 39.
[1833.54 → 1843.42] At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
[1843.42 → 1849.96] And at three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[1850.92 → 1856.16] Eloy, Eloy, Lima sabachthani, which means,
[1856.16 → 1863.72] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[1865.32 → 1869.60] When some of those standing near heard this, they said,
[1870.24 → 1871.80] Listen, he's calling Elijah.
[1872.82 → 1876.42] Someone ran, filled the spoons with wine vinegar,
[1877.14 → 1880.64] put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
[1880.64 → 1887.92] Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down, he said.
[1889.46 → 1896.00] With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
[1897.48 → 1902.70] The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
[1902.70 → 1908.78] And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus,
[1909.60 → 1913.98] saw how he had died, he said,
[1915.22 → 1919.70] Surely this man was the Son of God.
[1921.02 → 1924.22] This is the Word of God.
[1924.94 → 1926.34] Thanks be to God.
[1926.34 → 1940.00] Let's pray together.
[1940.42 → 1942.60] Let's ask for the Spirit's illumination.
[1945.88 → 1948.46] Father, we thank you for calling us to worship this morning
[1948.46 → 1953.18] and for calling us to listen, to listen to your Word,
[1953.18 → 1957.32] to hear from you and to hear, especially, Lord, your heart,
[1957.56 → 1959.58] your heart of love for us and for the world.
[1961.34 → 1964.76] Lord, we come before you, your presence at this moment.
[1965.70 → 1970.54] I ask that you would make us attentive in your faithful servants.
[1970.76 → 1972.40] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1974.36 → 1975.54] So good morning again.
[1975.54 → 1979.50] This is the fourth Sunday in the church season of Lent,
[1979.50 → 1984.22] which is the season when the church considers the suffering and death of Jesus,
[1984.76 → 1989.28] the suffering and death that he endured for the life of the world.
[1990.40 → 1994.12] And as we walk together through this season of Lent
[1994.12 → 1996.74] and toward the joys of Easter,
[1997.38 → 2000.60] each week we are considering together one of the last,
[2001.24 → 2005.72] of the seven last words of Jesus spoken from the cross.
[2005.72 → 2009.54] And as we listen to what Jesus says from the cross,
[2009.58 → 2012.82] what we want to do is listen to the heart of Christ,
[2013.68 → 2018.42] to hear from the cross what he really cares about,
[2018.96 → 2021.50] what he is really like,
[2022.38 → 2023.88] what his heart is,
[2023.92 → 2027.86] so that then our hearts might respond and say,
[2028.06 → 2029.86] this is how we are loved.
[2029.86 → 2035.10] So what do we see in the heart of Christ on the cross?
[2036.00 → 2038.62] Well, the first Sunday we heard a word of care.
[2039.80 → 2041.30] Woman, here is your son.
[2042.06 → 2042.90] And to the disciple,
[2043.62 → 2044.80] here is your mother.
[2045.66 → 2046.70] From that time on,
[2046.80 → 2049.52] this disciple took her into his home.
[2051.16 → 2053.70] The second Sunday we heard a word of forgiveness.
[2054.56 → 2055.56] Father, forgive them,
[2055.64 → 2058.30] for they do not know what they are doing.
[2058.30 → 2062.60] The third Sunday we heard a word of redemption.
[2063.78 → 2064.92] Truly I tell you,
[2065.00 → 2067.64] today you will be with me in paradise.
[2068.78 → 2071.36] And today we come to perhaps
[2071.36 → 2075.98] the most mysterious of the seven words.
[2076.50 → 2078.84] It's the mystery of abandonment.
[2079.72 → 2080.66] Jesus cries out,
[2080.90 → 2082.38] my God, my God,
[2082.86 → 2085.50] why have you forsaken me?
[2085.50 → 2088.70] What does it mean to be forsaken?
[2090.20 → 2093.46] It's not a word we use very often.
[2094.92 → 2095.98] I looked it up.
[2096.28 → 2098.28] The dictionary says to forsake
[2098.28 → 2101.90] means to withdraw your companionship
[2101.90 → 2103.42] or your protection
[2103.42 → 2106.22] or support from a person.
[2107.62 → 2108.76] And the Jews listening
[2108.76 → 2109.98] would have recognized
[2110.78 → 2112.82] this cry of Jesus
[2112.82 → 2115.62] as the first line
[2115.62 → 2117.50] from Psalm 22.
[2117.86 → 2118.72] Just like sometimes
[2118.72 → 2119.36] when you hear
[2119.36 → 2120.66] a song on the radio
[2120.66 → 2121.90] or you hear the first phrase,
[2122.00 → 2123.50] you're able to know the whole song.
[2123.72 → 2124.54] It's kind of like that.
[2127.24 → 2128.22] I don't believe
[2128.22 → 2129.12] he was just speaking
[2129.12 → 2129.94] this psalm though
[2129.94 → 2130.86] to express
[2130.86 → 2132.70] his heart before God.
[2132.80 → 2133.90] I believe there is more
[2133.90 → 2135.36] going on than that.
[2135.74 → 2137.14] I believe there is fulfillment
[2137.14 → 2139.32] occurring at this moment.
[2139.32 → 2141.90] Psalm 22 verse 1
[2141.90 → 2142.58] gives us
[2142.58 → 2144.38] an even deeper insight
[2144.38 → 2145.32] into what Jesus
[2145.32 → 2146.38] is experiencing
[2146.38 → 2147.32] at this moment.
[2148.06 → 2149.02] Because he quotes
[2149.02 → 2150.52] the first part
[2150.52 → 2151.44] of verse 1
[2151.44 → 2152.54] but here is what
[2152.54 → 2154.02] the whole verse says.
[2155.02 → 2156.58] My God, my God,
[2156.66 → 2158.24] why have you forsaken me?
[2159.18 → 2160.98] Why are you so far
[2160.98 → 2162.32] from saving me?
[2162.32 → 2163.82] So far
[2163.82 → 2165.54] from my cries
[2165.54 → 2166.50] of anguish.
[2166.50 → 2169.02] the Saviour
[2169.02 → 2170.38] asks God
[2170.38 → 2171.00] why
[2171.00 → 2173.06] he is so far
[2173.06 → 2174.20] from saving him.
[2176.56 → 2177.60] Do you know
[2177.60 → 2178.16] what it's like
[2178.16 → 2179.36] to be forsaken?
[2180.78 → 2181.82] Have you ever been
[2181.82 → 2182.46] abandoned
[2182.46 → 2184.26] by someone you love
[2184.26 → 2184.92] or by someone
[2184.92 → 2185.48] who is supposed
[2185.48 → 2186.20] to love you?
[2187.22 → 2188.24] Where maybe
[2188.24 → 2189.24] that person has
[2189.24 → 2191.56] walked away from you
[2191.56 → 2192.92] and turned their face
[2192.92 → 2193.66] away from you.
[2193.66 → 2198.56] What came to my mind
[2198.56 → 2200.48] is just a light example.
[2201.54 → 2202.62] When I was
[2202.62 → 2204.16] a young child
[2204.16 → 2205.18] I had a good friend
[2205.18 → 2205.78] and together
[2205.78 → 2206.62] we went off
[2206.62 → 2208.04] to a summer camp.
[2208.14 → 2208.44] Like there are
[2208.44 → 2209.30] many summer camps
[2209.30 → 2209.96] here in the lower
[2209.96 → 2210.88] in BC
[2210.88 → 2213.10] and there are fun times
[2213.10 → 2213.26] right?
[2213.30 → 2214.24] You get to go boating
[2214.24 → 2215.98] sing songs
[2215.98 → 2217.88] have a campfire
[2217.88 → 2218.66] things like that.
[2218.78 → 2219.78] I was so excited
[2219.78 → 2220.18] to go
[2220.18 → 2221.10] but my friend
[2221.10 → 2222.22] so we both
[2222.22 → 2222.96] got dropped off
[2222.96 → 2223.86] and I was excited
[2223.86 → 2224.60] I grabbed my stuff
[2224.60 → 2225.22] I ran off
[2225.22 → 2225.96] to find my
[2225.96 → 2226.50] you know
[2226.50 → 2226.98] my group.
[2227.54 → 2228.16] My friend
[2228.16 → 2229.86] refused
[2229.86 → 2230.80] to leave
[2230.80 → 2231.50] the parking lot.
[2232.36 → 2233.24] He just
[2233.24 → 2234.24] stood there
[2234.24 → 2234.88] he was
[2234.88 → 2236.30] so put out
[2236.30 → 2237.46] and eventually
[2237.46 → 2238.08] his mom
[2238.08 → 2238.60] just had to
[2238.60 → 2239.64] leave him
[2239.64 → 2240.58] he did not
[2240.58 → 2241.30] want to be there.
[2242.10 → 2242.80] My mom
[2242.80 → 2243.22] my mom
[2243.22 → 2243.80] why have you
[2243.80 → 2244.56] forsaken me?
[2244.96 → 2245.52] He just
[2245.52 → 2246.22] didn't want
[2246.22 → 2246.60] to be there
[2246.60 → 2247.10] he felt
[2247.10 → 2247.94] abandoned
[2247.94 → 2249.92] at summer camp.
[2250.96 → 2251.58] Again of course
[2251.58 → 2252.12] that's a light
[2252.12 → 2252.56] example.
[2252.76 → 2253.24] Many of us
[2253.24 → 2254.28] have experienced
[2254.28 → 2255.94] this feeling
[2255.94 → 2256.84] of abandonment
[2256.84 → 2257.86] in maybe
[2257.86 → 2258.86] much more
[2258.86 → 2260.24] hurtful ways.
[2261.30 → 2261.80] But Jesus
[2261.80 → 2262.82] on the cross
[2262.82 → 2263.82] being abandoned
[2263.82 → 2266.02] by God the Father
[2266.02 → 2267.68] reveals the
[2267.68 → 2268.74] unfathomable
[2268.74 → 2269.36] depths
[2269.36 → 2270.16] to which
[2270.16 → 2271.08] he went
[2271.08 → 2272.10] to accomplish
[2272.10 → 2273.20] our salvation.
[2274.36 → 2275.20] The depth
[2275.20 → 2276.16] was dramatically
[2276.16 → 2276.92] emphasized
[2276.92 → 2278.24] by the
[2278.24 → 2278.76] darkness
[2278.76 → 2280.56] that engulfed
[2280.56 → 2281.28] the cross.
[2283.64 → 2284.36] Mark
[2284.36 → 2285.00] says
[2285.00 → 2285.58] simply in
[2285.58 → 2286.32] verse 33
[2286.32 → 2288.28] he says
[2288.28 → 2289.04] at noon
[2289.04 → 2290.26] darkness
[2290.26 → 2291.74] came over
[2291.74 → 2292.60] the whole
[2292.60 → 2293.42] land
[2293.42 → 2294.84] until three
[2294.84 → 2295.66] in the afternoon.
[2296.82 → 2297.78] At noon
[2297.78 → 2298.34] a darkness
[2298.34 → 2298.78] came over
[2298.78 → 2299.24] the land.
[2300.04 → 2300.92] It extended
[2300.92 → 2301.50] for three
[2301.50 → 2302.40] long hours
[2302.40 → 2303.48] until three
[2303.48 → 2304.28] in the afternoon.
[2305.18 → 2305.98] Most likely
[2305.98 → 2306.56] the darkness
[2306.56 → 2307.26] was local.
[2307.84 → 2308.20] Probably
[2308.20 → 2308.64] it was over
[2308.64 → 2309.34] the cross
[2309.34 → 2311.02] perhaps over
[2311.02 → 2311.58] Jerusalem
[2311.58 → 2312.08] and maybe
[2312.08 → 2312.58] even over
[2312.58 → 2313.24] the surrounding
[2313.24 → 2314.46] areas
[2314.46 → 2315.58] of the
[2315.58 → 2315.98] countryside
[2315.98 → 2316.46] around.
[2316.56 → 2316.82] We don't
[2316.82 → 2317.10] know.
[2318.10 → 2318.68] But whatever
[2318.68 → 2319.30] the case
[2319.30 → 2319.86] the darkness
[2319.86 → 2320.60] came all
[2320.60 → 2321.14] of a sudden
[2321.14 → 2322.70] right in the
[2322.70 → 2323.28] middle of the
[2323.28 → 2323.66] day
[2323.66 → 2324.70] for three
[2324.70 → 2325.30] hours.
[2326.08 → 2326.44] And all
[2326.44 → 2326.70] of the
[2326.70 → 2327.26] gospels
[2327.26 → 2328.70] regard this
[2328.70 → 2329.60] as absolutely
[2329.60 → 2330.18] miraculous.
[2330.18 → 2330.40] miraculous.
[2332.46 → 2333.18] So just
[2333.18 → 2333.98] imagine this
[2333.98 → 2334.64] dense
[2334.64 → 2336.00] thick
[2336.00 → 2337.24] darkness.
[2338.54 → 2338.98] Perhaps
[2338.98 → 2339.62] the soldiers
[2339.62 → 2340.12] ignited
[2340.12 → 2340.64] torches
[2340.64 → 2341.54] in the
[2341.54 → 2341.90] darkness
[2341.90 → 2342.38] and by
[2342.38 → 2342.88] flickering
[2342.88 → 2343.56] torchlight
[2343.56 → 2344.20] they watched
[2344.20 → 2344.80] Christ on
[2344.80 → 2345.24] the cross.
[2346.24 → 2346.82] But in
[2346.82 → 2347.52] that unnatural
[2347.52 → 2348.04] darkness
[2348.04 → 2349.72] there was
[2349.72 → 2351.26] silence.
[2352.54 → 2353.28] Silence
[2353.28 → 2353.96] all around.
[2354.76 → 2355.28] The gospels
[2355.28 → 2356.10] record no
[2356.10 → 2356.94] words from
[2356.94 → 2357.32] the Lord
[2357.32 → 2357.70] Jesus
[2357.70 → 2358.88] during those
[2358.88 → 2359.86] three hours
[2359.86 → 2361.30] during that
[2361.30 → 2362.08] midday
[2362.08 → 2363.22] eerie gloom.
[2365.52 → 2365.98] Now it's
[2365.98 → 2366.50] the complete
[2366.50 → 2367.34] reversal of
[2367.34 → 2367.84] what happened
[2367.84 → 2368.80] 33 years
[2368.80 → 2369.20] ago.
[2369.74 → 2369.90] Do you
[2369.90 → 2370.40] remember what
[2370.40 → 2370.90] happened when
[2370.90 → 2371.40] Jesus was
[2371.40 → 2371.70] born?
[2372.80 → 2373.30] On a
[2373.30 → 2374.06] hillside where
[2374.06 → 2374.70] shepherds were
[2374.70 → 2375.32] tending their
[2375.32 → 2375.84] flocks at
[2375.84 → 2376.20] night.
[2377.32 → 2377.86] What happened?
[2378.10 → 2378.60] A host of
[2378.60 → 2379.74] angels appeared
[2379.74 → 2380.92] lighting up
[2380.92 → 2382.12] the night sky
[2382.12 → 2383.60] singing glory
[2383.60 → 2384.24] to God in
[2384.24 → 2384.84] the highest.
[2384.84 → 2387.24] And now in
[2387.24 → 2387.86] the middle of
[2387.86 → 2388.90] the day at
[2388.90 → 2389.62] high noon
[2389.62 → 2390.88] there's
[2390.88 → 2391.48] darkness
[2391.48 → 2393.24] and silence
[2393.24 → 2394.62] as Jesus
[2394.62 → 2395.52] exits the
[2395.52 → 2395.82] world.
[2397.42 → 2398.42] Now why
[2398.42 → 2399.00] the darkness?
[2400.68 → 2401.74] How are we
[2401.74 → 2402.38] supposed to
[2402.38 → 2403.88] understand the
[2403.88 → 2404.48] significance
[2404.48 → 2406.76] of this?
[2407.68 → 2408.08] Well the
[2408.08 → 2408.70] first reason
[2408.70 → 2409.02] for the
[2409.02 → 2409.68] darkness is
[2409.68 → 2410.18] that it
[2410.18 → 2410.74] was a sign
[2410.74 → 2411.26] of mourning.
[2412.48 → 2412.82] The prophet
[2412.82 → 2413.92] Amos prophesied
[2413.92 → 2414.32] that there
[2414.32 → 2414.72] would be
[2414.72 → 2415.30] darkness.
[2416.56 → 2418.20] In Amos
[2418.20 → 2418.92] chapter 9
[2418.92 → 2420.38] sorry chapter
[2420.38 → 2420.96] 8 verses
[2420.96 → 2421.68] 9 and 10
[2421.68 → 2422.98] this is what
[2422.98 → 2423.40] it says.
[2423.60 → 2424.26] In that day
[2424.26 → 2424.98] declares the
[2424.98 → 2425.58] sovereign Lord
[2425.58 → 2426.36] I will make
[2426.36 → 2427.06] the sun go
[2427.06 → 2427.86] down at
[2427.86 → 2428.26] noon.
[2429.10 → 2429.96] In darkness
[2429.96 → 2431.04] and darken
[2431.04 → 2431.48] the earth
[2431.48 → 2431.96] and broad
[2431.96 → 2433.50] daylight I
[2433.50 → 2433.98] will make
[2433.98 → 2434.72] that time
[2434.72 → 2435.86] like mourning
[2435.86 → 2436.98] for an
[2436.98 → 2437.58] only son.
[2440.78 → 2441.18] And so in
[2441.18 → 2441.54] the middle
[2441.54 → 2442.16] of the day
[2442.16 → 2442.98] the cross is
[2442.98 → 2443.82] draped in
[2443.82 → 2444.46] the sack
[2444.46 → 2445.68] cloth of
[2445.68 → 2446.32] the darkness
[2446.32 → 2447.00] of mourning.
[2448.30 → 2448.90] And so by
[2448.90 → 2449.88] the darkness
[2449.88 → 2450.70] we're to
[2450.70 → 2452.20] understand that
[2452.20 → 2452.82] God is
[2452.82 → 2453.16] mourning.
[2453.70 → 2454.36] He is mourning
[2454.36 → 2454.80] over the
[2454.80 → 2455.32] situation.
[2455.50 → 2455.88] God's own
[2455.88 → 2457.28] heart in
[2457.28 → 2457.74] this moment
[2457.74 → 2458.52] is broken.
[2460.40 → 2461.12] Now to
[2461.12 → 2462.14] understand this
[2462.14 → 2463.80] this mystery
[2463.80 → 2464.86] multitude of
[2464.86 → 2465.74] mysteries here
[2465.74 → 2467.48] let me remind
[2467.48 → 2468.02] you of our
[2468.02 → 2468.78] church's faith.
[2468.78 → 2468.84] faith.
[2470.02 → 2470.54] The God
[2470.54 → 2471.26] who exists
[2471.26 → 2472.38] is one.
[2473.66 → 2474.52] The God
[2474.52 → 2475.60] who exists
[2475.60 → 2476.08] is also
[2476.08 → 2476.46] three.
[2477.56 → 2478.32] One God
[2478.32 → 2478.72] in three
[2478.72 → 2479.44] persons is
[2479.44 → 2479.82] how the
[2479.82 → 2480.82] church has
[2480.82 → 2481.20] learned to
[2481.20 → 2481.76] express it.
[2482.90 → 2483.76] The persons
[2483.76 → 2484.64] are distinct
[2484.64 → 2486.14] and they
[2486.14 → 2486.60] are the
[2486.60 → 2486.98] same.
[2488.28 → 2489.38] They are
[2489.38 → 2490.10] I am
[2490.10 → 2490.58] who I
[2490.58 → 2492.16] am and
[2492.16 → 2493.64] he is
[2493.64 → 2494.18] the father
[2494.18 → 2494.70] the son
[2494.70 → 2494.92] and the
[2494.92 → 2495.46] Holy Spirit.
[2495.46 → 2497.54] this is
[2497.54 → 2499.16] true and
[2499.16 → 2499.54] it is a
[2499.54 → 2500.10] great mystery.
[2502.22 → 2502.94] And for
[2502.94 → 2503.64] all time
[2503.64 → 2504.44] before all
[2504.44 → 2505.96] time God
[2505.96 → 2506.72] has enjoyed
[2506.72 → 2508.04] perfect love.
[2508.94 → 2509.50] God the
[2509.50 → 2510.22] father is
[2510.22 → 2510.82] self-giving
[2510.82 → 2511.26] love.
[2512.00 → 2512.60] He is the
[2512.60 → 2512.90] lover.
[2514.20 → 2514.68] God the
[2514.68 → 2515.34] son whom
[2515.34 → 2515.62] we know
[2515.62 → 2516.14] is Jesus
[2516.14 → 2517.46] he is the
[2517.46 → 2517.88] beloved.
[2518.08 → 2518.44] He is the
[2518.44 → 2519.46] receiver of
[2519.46 → 2520.66] love and
[2520.66 → 2521.00] God the
[2521.00 → 2521.54] Holy Spirit
[2521.54 → 2522.00] is love
[2522.00 → 2522.68] shared between
[2522.68 → 2523.18] the two.
[2524.36 → 2524.84] The early
[2524.84 → 2525.58] church fathers
[2525.58 → 2526.34] described the
[2526.34 → 2527.06] inner life of
[2527.06 → 2527.48] the trinity
[2527.48 → 2527.88] like a
[2527.88 → 2528.36] dance.
[2529.48 → 2530.32] This dynamic
[2530.32 → 2531.00] movement where
[2531.00 → 2531.84] each one
[2531.84 → 2533.32] entering its
[2533.32 → 2534.00] life upon
[2534.00 → 2534.52] the other.
[2535.78 → 2536.52] It was and
[2536.52 → 2537.54] is perfect
[2537.54 → 2538.60] unity.
[2540.14 → 2540.60] And this
[2540.60 → 2541.10] love is
[2541.10 → 2541.94] constant and
[2541.94 → 2542.58] unchanging.
[2543.14 → 2543.42] It is the
[2543.42 → 2544.38] very highest
[2544.38 → 2546.20] beauty and
[2546.20 → 2546.82] joy that
[2546.82 → 2547.40] exists.
[2548.62 → 2548.88] Nothing
[2548.88 → 2549.74] surpasses it.
[2550.68 → 2551.34] All beauty
[2551.34 → 2552.06] and joy that
[2552.06 → 2553.42] we know in
[2553.42 → 2554.12] this world is
[2554.12 → 2554.68] but a weak
[2554.68 → 2556.06] picture of
[2556.06 → 2557.04] this love
[2557.04 → 2557.70] of God.
[2558.68 → 2559.22] Father,
[2559.44 → 2559.64] Son,
[2559.72 → 2560.02] and Holy
[2560.02 → 2560.44] Spirit,
[2560.58 → 2561.14] our love
[2561.14 → 2561.84] originated,
[2562.40 → 2563.26] love received,
[2563.64 → 2564.26] and love in
[2564.26 → 2564.68] action.
[2565.56 → 2566.26] This is the
[2566.26 → 2566.66] God who
[2566.66 → 2567.18] exists.
[2567.92 → 2568.32] This is
[2568.32 → 2568.70] true.
[2569.62 → 2570.02] And say it
[2570.02 → 2570.34] with me.
[2570.84 → 2571.54] And it is
[2571.54 → 2572.46] a great
[2572.46 → 2572.78] mystery.
[2575.70 → 2576.40] And this
[2576.40 → 2576.98] God of
[2576.98 → 2578.34] love lacks
[2578.34 → 2578.94] nothing.
[2580.72 → 2581.66] And yet the
[2581.66 → 2582.42] triune God
[2582.42 → 2583.54] desired to
[2583.54 → 2584.06] love more
[2584.06 → 2584.80] than himself.
[2585.62 → 2585.94] So God
[2585.94 → 2586.62] created the
[2586.62 → 2587.06] heavens and
[2587.06 → 2587.42] the earth,
[2587.48 → 2587.84] all things
[2587.84 → 2588.52] visible and
[2588.52 → 2589.00] invisible,
[2589.48 → 2589.84] and he
[2589.84 → 2590.44] made people
[2590.44 → 2590.98] in his
[2590.98 → 2591.32] image,
[2591.36 → 2591.66] he made
[2591.66 → 2592.06] us male
[2592.06 → 2592.70] and female,
[2592.92 → 2593.62] to share
[2593.62 → 2594.24] in the
[2594.24 → 2594.90] dance of
[2594.90 → 2595.48] self-giving
[2595.48 → 2595.88] love.
[2597.36 → 2597.98] But we
[2597.98 → 2598.28] did not
[2598.28 → 2598.92] trust him,
[2599.22 → 2599.66] and so we
[2599.66 → 2600.38] disobeyed him.
[2601.62 → 2601.94] And the
[2601.94 → 2602.34] life of
[2602.34 → 2603.18] perfect love
[2603.18 → 2603.68] that we
[2603.68 → 2604.80] had with
[2604.80 → 2605.66] our creator
[2605.66 → 2607.22] was shattered
[2607.22 → 2608.02] and ruined.
[2609.02 → 2609.56] There is now
[2609.56 → 2610.36] shadow where
[2610.36 → 2611.32] there had
[2611.32 → 2611.80] been only
[2611.80 → 2612.28] light,
[2612.92 → 2613.32] all of
[2613.32 → 2614.06] creation now
[2614.06 → 2614.36] is not
[2614.36 → 2616.56] the way it
[2616.56 → 2617.08] was meant
[2617.08 → 2617.66] to be.
[2618.60 → 2619.06] It's hard
[2619.06 → 2619.88] to understand,
[2620.40 → 2620.84] but this
[2620.84 → 2621.48] is the
[2621.48 → 2622.52] fountain of
[2622.52 → 2623.28] all sadness
[2623.28 → 2623.84] and all
[2623.84 → 2624.18] suffering.
[2625.12 → 2625.50] We were
[2625.50 → 2625.94] made for
[2625.94 → 2626.34] life with
[2626.34 → 2626.68] God.
[2629.10 → 2629.84] We were
[2629.84 → 2630.68] made for
[2630.68 → 2631.62] God's love.
[2631.74 → 2631.98] We were
[2631.98 → 2632.50] made to
[2632.50 → 2633.98] participate in
[2633.98 → 2634.72] the dance,
[2634.86 → 2635.48] but we have
[2635.48 → 2636.38] cut ourselves
[2636.38 → 2637.34] off from
[2637.34 → 2637.88] the music.
[2637.88 → 2639.84] this is
[2639.84 → 2640.26] true,
[2641.26 → 2642.20] and it
[2642.20 → 2642.48] is a
[2642.48 → 2642.66] great
[2642.66 → 2643.06] mystery.
[2645.06 → 2645.84] But God
[2645.84 → 2646.62] so loved
[2646.62 → 2647.36] the world
[2647.36 → 2648.24] that he
[2648.24 → 2649.12] sent the
[2649.12 → 2649.52] beloved,
[2650.18 → 2650.66] God the
[2650.66 → 2650.92] Son,
[2650.96 → 2651.44] who freely
[2651.44 → 2651.98] emptied
[2651.98 → 2652.48] himself,
[2652.88 → 2653.08] and he
[2653.08 → 2653.48] became
[2653.48 → 2654.10] Emmanuel,
[2654.84 → 2655.20] God
[2655.20 → 2656.16] with us.
[2657.24 → 2657.70] At the
[2657.70 → 2658.50] proper time,
[2658.58 → 2658.84] he was
[2658.84 → 2659.38] born of
[2659.38 → 2659.82] a woman,
[2660.40 → 2661.12] born under
[2661.12 → 2661.64] the law
[2661.64 → 2661.98] of the
[2661.98 → 2662.40] Jews.
[2663.66 → 2664.18] This
[2664.18 → 2664.44] man,
[2664.52 → 2664.76] Jesus,
[2664.88 → 2665.32] is the
[2665.32 → 2665.78] image of
[2665.78 → 2666.24] the invisible
[2666.24 → 2666.72] God,
[2666.72 → 2667.04] and he
[2667.04 → 2667.62] took on
[2667.62 → 2668.26] flesh like
[2668.26 → 2668.68] ours.
[2669.90 → 2670.44] The church
[2670.44 → 2670.84] has learned
[2670.84 → 2671.44] to confess
[2671.44 → 2671.84] that he
[2671.84 → 2672.32] has two
[2672.32 → 2672.78] natures.
[2673.36 → 2673.72] He is at
[2673.72 → 2674.44] once human
[2674.44 → 2676.00] and divine,
[2676.58 → 2677.28] fully God
[2677.28 → 2678.42] and fully
[2678.42 → 2678.86] man.
[2679.94 → 2680.36] This is
[2680.36 → 2680.70] true,
[2681.62 → 2682.28] and it
[2682.28 → 2682.60] is a
[2682.60 → 2682.80] great
[2682.80 → 2683.18] mystery.
[2684.84 → 2685.24] It is
[2685.24 → 2686.08] this person
[2686.08 → 2686.90] who hangs
[2686.90 → 2688.28] on his
[2688.28 → 2689.38] cross for
[2689.38 → 2689.88] the redemption
[2689.88 → 2690.34] of the
[2690.34 → 2690.62] world,
[2691.14 → 2692.54] to heal
[2692.54 → 2693.06] us of our
[2693.06 → 2693.78] sicknesses,
[2694.32 → 2695.98] to shine
[2695.98 → 2696.68] his light
[2696.68 → 2697.20] into our
[2697.20 → 2697.62] darkness,
[2698.10 → 2698.80] to forgive
[2698.80 → 2699.46] us of our
[2699.46 → 2699.96] guilt and
[2699.96 → 2700.46] to erase
[2700.46 → 2701.10] our shame,
[2701.68 → 2702.32] to free
[2702.32 → 2702.68] us from
[2702.68 → 2703.28] Satan and
[2703.28 → 2704.44] from the
[2704.44 → 2705.00] fear of
[2705.00 → 2705.38] death,
[2706.02 → 2707.14] to restore
[2707.14 → 2708.28] us to
[2708.28 → 2708.94] the unity
[2708.94 → 2710.08] with the
[2710.08 → 2710.86] triune God
[2710.86 → 2711.42] of love.
[2712.88 → 2713.42] But for
[2713.42 → 2714.14] the sake of
[2714.14 → 2715.10] all of this
[2715.10 → 2715.74] good, this
[2715.74 → 2716.62] redemption that
[2716.62 → 2717.14] he came to
[2717.14 → 2717.68] accomplish,
[2718.22 → 2719.12] Christ had to
[2719.12 → 2719.92] pass through
[2719.92 → 2721.02] the horror
[2721.02 → 2722.42] of abandonment.
[2722.42 → 2724.50] And in
[2724.50 → 2724.90] the moment
[2724.90 → 2725.68] of abandonment,
[2725.76 → 2726.36] the eternal
[2726.36 → 2727.74] music was
[2727.74 → 2728.16] silent.
[2729.18 → 2729.88] The father's
[2729.88 → 2731.78] love turned
[2731.78 → 2732.30] away.
[2733.14 → 2733.62] The son's
[2733.62 → 2735.06] receiving was
[2735.06 → 2735.78] cut off,
[2736.02 → 2736.84] and the spirit
[2736.84 → 2737.92] ceased to
[2737.92 → 2738.24] flow.
[2739.56 → 2740.02] And this is
[2740.02 → 2740.74] why we hear
[2740.74 → 2741.62] the cry of
[2741.62 → 2741.94] Jesus,
[2742.24 → 2742.80] my God,
[2742.86 → 2743.36] my God,
[2743.42 → 2744.06] why have
[2744.06 → 2745.42] you have forsaken
[2745.42 → 2745.78] me?
[2747.04 → 2747.58] In the
[2747.58 → 2748.16] darkness on
[2748.16 → 2748.76] the cross,
[2749.48 → 2750.46] Jesus was
[2750.46 → 2751.76] alone.
[2752.42 → 2754.26] it's not
[2754.26 → 2754.72] just that he
[2754.72 → 2755.60] felt he was
[2755.60 → 2756.40] alone, he
[2756.40 → 2757.46] was absolutely
[2757.46 → 2759.16] alone in
[2759.16 → 2759.64] the darkness.
[2761.40 → 2762.00] And I
[2762.00 → 2762.56] believe that in
[2762.56 → 2763.36] this cry of
[2763.36 → 2765.04] abandonment, we
[2765.04 → 2765.50] are given
[2765.50 → 2766.20] insight both
[2766.20 → 2766.74] into the heart
[2766.74 → 2767.60] of Jesus and
[2767.60 → 2768.14] the heart of
[2768.14 → 2768.62] the father.
[2769.34 → 2769.92] In the son's
[2769.92 → 2770.90] experience, there
[2770.90 → 2771.56] must have been
[2771.56 → 2772.24] this overwhelming
[2772.24 → 2773.64] sense of
[2773.64 → 2774.58] desertion, of
[2774.58 → 2776.04] abandonment, of
[2776.04 → 2776.98] broken fellowship,
[2777.16 → 2777.98] of a loss of
[2777.98 → 2779.42] love, the
[2779.42 → 2780.54] utter aloneness,
[2780.54 → 2782.30] as he was
[2782.30 → 2783.56] willing to
[2783.56 → 2784.22] lay down
[2784.22 → 2784.80] his life.
[2786.08 → 2786.36] And then
[2786.36 → 2786.68] from the
[2786.68 → 2787.18] father's
[2787.18 → 2787.66] perspective,
[2787.88 → 2788.24] there must
[2788.24 → 2788.66] have been
[2788.66 → 2789.82] the anguish
[2789.82 → 2791.62] of withdrawing
[2791.62 → 2792.98] his companionship
[2792.98 → 2793.72] and protection
[2793.72 → 2795.02] from his
[2795.02 → 2795.84] beloved son,
[2796.10 → 2796.54] as he
[2796.54 → 2796.86] willingly
[2796.86 → 2798.34] sacrificed the
[2798.34 → 2799.18] one in whom
[2799.18 → 2799.76] he was well
[2799.76 → 2800.18] pleased.
[2802.16 → 2803.06] So I want
[2803.06 → 2803.28] you to
[2803.28 → 2803.82] understand this
[2803.82 → 2804.32] morning that
[2804.32 → 2804.76] God the
[2804.76 → 2805.30] father and
[2805.30 → 2805.74] God the
[2805.74 → 2806.40] son's heart
[2806.40 → 2807.74] for you is
[2807.74 → 2808.30] the same.
[2808.30 → 2810.56] God was
[2810.56 → 2811.28] willing to
[2811.28 → 2812.84] allow separation
[2812.84 → 2815.52] in relationship
[2815.52 → 2817.04] between the
[2817.04 → 2817.68] father and
[2817.68 → 2818.14] the son.
[2818.94 → 2819.38] Of course,
[2819.44 → 2820.02] there was no
[2820.02 → 2821.64] break in the
[2821.64 → 2822.76] unity of God's
[2822.76 → 2823.40] being or
[2823.40 → 2825.32] purpose, but
[2825.32 → 2825.64] in the
[2825.64 → 2826.30] experience of
[2826.30 → 2827.44] relationship for
[2827.44 → 2828.82] a time, this
[2828.82 → 2829.62] was a reality
[2829.62 → 2830.48] so that you
[2830.48 → 2831.12] and I would
[2831.12 → 2832.38] never have to
[2832.38 → 2833.00] be separated
[2833.00 → 2833.60] from God.
[2835.14 → 2836.06] So that's the
[2836.06 → 2836.86] first reason for
[2836.86 → 2837.44] this darkness
[2837.44 → 2838.28] that engulfed
[2838.28 → 2838.90] the cross.
[2839.54 → 2840.60] It was a sign
[2840.60 → 2841.52] of mourning
[2841.52 → 2843.06] as God
[2843.06 → 2843.88] turned his
[2843.88 → 2844.74] face away
[2844.74 → 2845.60] from his
[2845.60 → 2846.64] son and as
[2846.64 → 2847.20] Jesus was
[2847.20 → 2847.60] abandoned.
[2849.16 → 2850.14] But there's a
[2850.14 → 2850.96] second meaning
[2850.96 → 2852.04] and significance
[2852.04 → 2852.42] of the
[2852.42 → 2852.92] darkness,
[2853.54 → 2854.94] which is that
[2854.94 → 2855.90] darkness also
[2855.90 → 2857.30] signifies the
[2857.30 → 2858.52] curse of God's
[2858.52 → 2858.84] judgment.
[2860.20 → 2860.94] In the book
[2860.94 → 2861.44] of Exodus,
[2862.32 → 2863.24] the plague of
[2863.24 → 2864.36] darkness spread
[2864.36 → 2865.60] over the land
[2865.60 → 2867.68] before the
[2867.68 → 2868.56] Passover lamb
[2868.56 → 2869.28] was slain.
[2870.44 → 2870.96] And now,
[2871.12 → 2871.82] with the death
[2871.82 → 2872.62] of the ultimate
[2872.62 → 2873.42] Passover lamb,
[2873.52 → 2874.12] there is darkness
[2874.12 → 2875.10] over the land
[2875.10 → 2876.22] and God's
[2876.22 → 2877.32] judgment is
[2877.32 → 2878.20] being poured
[2878.20 → 2878.58] out.
[2879.96 → 2881.08] When we see
[2881.08 → 2882.68] this, it takes
[2882.68 → 2883.34] us to the very
[2883.34 → 2884.18] centre of what is
[2884.18 → 2884.54] happening.
[2885.24 → 2886.02] For in those
[2886.02 → 2887.04] three black
[2887.04 → 2888.54] hours, the
[2888.54 → 2889.32] perfect eternal
[2889.32 → 2890.12] son of God
[2890.12 → 2892.04] had to become
[2892.04 → 2893.02] something that he
[2893.02 → 2893.90] had never been
[2893.90 → 2894.38] before.
[2895.46 → 2895.88] Do you know
[2895.88 → 2896.64] what Jesus had
[2896.64 → 2897.46] to become
[2897.46 → 2898.18] for us?
[2899.12 → 2900.08] Three letters.
[2901.40 → 2901.78] Sin.
[2903.52 → 2904.58] The only
[2904.58 → 2905.46] reason that
[2905.46 → 2906.08] Jesus was
[2906.08 → 2907.86] forsaken was
[2907.86 → 2908.64] that he had
[2908.64 → 2909.56] transferred onto
[2909.56 → 2910.82] himself something
[2910.82 → 2912.12] that wasn't his
[2912.12 → 2913.22] that did not
[2913.22 → 2914.32] belong to him.
[2915.18 → 2915.42] Right?
[2915.74 → 2916.26] Jesus was
[2916.26 → 2917.62] innocent, he
[2917.62 → 2918.36] was sinless,
[2918.52 → 2919.58] and he took
[2919.58 → 2920.62] our guilt,
[2921.18 → 2922.18] our sin,
[2922.50 → 2923.44] our brokenness,
[2923.44 → 2924.48] our lostness,
[2924.78 → 2925.68] our disease,
[2926.08 → 2926.84] our blindness,
[2927.08 → 2927.88] and our death.
[2928.28 → 2928.90] All of our
[2928.90 → 2930.04] sin was put
[2930.04 → 2930.72] on Christ.
[2932.52 → 2932.82] You know, and
[2932.82 → 2934.08] that's why a
[2934.08 → 2934.78] movie like
[2934.78 → 2935.40] The Passion,
[2935.56 → 2936.10] maybe as some
[2936.10 → 2936.40] of you have
[2936.40 → 2937.04] seen The Passion
[2937.04 → 2937.76] by Mel Gibson,
[2939.10 → 2939.94] it shows the
[2939.94 → 2940.84] violence of the
[2940.84 → 2941.84] crucifixion, but
[2941.84 → 2942.46] I don't think
[2942.46 → 2943.04] that is that
[2943.04 → 2943.44] helpful.
[2944.56 → 2945.36] Because human
[2945.36 → 2946.20] suffering is not
[2946.20 → 2946.52] new.
[2947.42 → 2947.56] Right?
[2947.64 → 2948.12] Millions of
[2948.12 → 2948.94] people have
[2948.94 → 2949.76] been tortured in
[2949.76 → 2950.86] horrific ways.
[2950.86 → 2952.22] But the
[2952.22 → 2953.14] significance of
[2953.14 → 2953.78] Christ's death
[2953.78 → 2954.38] is not something
[2954.38 → 2954.84] that we can
[2954.84 → 2956.16] capture on
[2956.16 → 2956.52] video.
[2957.52 → 2958.38] It is who
[2958.38 → 2959.30] Jesus is,
[2959.98 → 2961.08] and it is what
[2961.08 → 2962.42] he did that we
[2962.42 → 2963.34] can't see that
[2963.34 → 2964.40] makes the cross
[2964.40 → 2965.52] so significant.
[2966.80 → 2967.92] And that's why we
[2967.92 → 2968.70] need God's word,
[2968.80 → 2969.18] the scriptures,
[2969.36 → 2970.02] to tell us.
[2971.08 → 2971.94] So Peter makes
[2971.94 → 2973.20] it so clear to
[2973.20 → 2974.68] us in 1 Peter
[2974.68 → 2975.40] 2.24.
[2976.14 → 2976.68] He says,
[2976.68 → 2977.70] He himself bore
[2977.70 → 2979.12] our sins in
[2979.12 → 2979.80] his body on
[2979.80 → 2980.42] the cross so
[2980.42 → 2980.92] that we might
[2980.92 → 2981.76] die to sins and
[2981.76 → 2982.08] live for
[2982.08 → 2982.48] righteousness.
[2983.18 → 2984.48] By his wounds
[2984.48 → 2985.68] you have been
[2985.68 → 2986.00] healed.
[2987.78 → 2988.00] Right?
[2988.08 → 2988.42] See what it
[2988.42 → 2988.60] says.
[2988.70 → 2989.70] Jesus bore in
[2989.70 → 2991.34] his body our
[2991.34 → 2991.82] sins.
[2993.26 → 2994.10] And this is why
[2994.10 → 2994.84] it says in one
[2994.84 → 2995.32] of the most
[2995.32 → 2996.42] mysterious passages
[2996.42 → 2997.06] of scripture,
[2998.28 → 2999.24] in 2 Corinthians
[2999.24 → 3000.88] 5.21,
[3001.84 → 3002.32] it says,
[3002.42 → 3003.40] God made him
[3003.40 → 3004.32] who had no
[3004.32 → 3006.10] sin to be
[3006.10 → 3007.10] sin for us
[3007.10 → 3008.04] so that in
[3008.04 → 3008.74] him we might
[3008.74 → 3009.26] become the
[3009.26 → 3010.08] righteousness of
[3010.08 → 3010.42] God.
[3011.60 → 3012.90] Or as the
[3012.90 → 3014.08] living Bible so
[3014.08 → 3014.96] beautifully puts
[3014.96 → 3016.64] it, God took
[3016.64 → 3017.46] the sinless
[3017.46 → 3018.66] Christ and
[3018.66 → 3019.24] poured into
[3019.24 → 3020.54] him our sin.
[3021.34 → 3021.76] Then in
[3021.76 → 3022.40] exchange he
[3022.40 → 3022.98] poured God's
[3022.98 → 3023.48] goodness into
[3023.48 → 3023.86] us.
[3024.52 → 3025.00] This is what we
[3025.00 → 3025.54] call the great
[3025.54 → 3026.12] exchange.
[3027.08 → 3027.60] That was what
[3027.60 → 3028.08] was happening.
[3028.24 → 3029.22] God took the
[3029.22 → 3030.60] sinless Christ and
[3030.60 → 3031.24] took all of our
[3031.24 → 3032.32] sin and poured
[3032.32 → 3034.52] it into him.
[3036.10 → 3037.84] And so as
[3037.84 → 3038.66] Jesus hung there
[3038.66 → 3039.58] on the cross in
[3039.58 → 3040.68] the dark silence,
[3042.56 → 3043.04] I mean, we
[3043.04 → 3043.64] don't know what
[3043.64 → 3044.22] it's like, but
[3044.22 → 3044.94] I just imagine
[3044.94 → 3048.00] wave upon wave
[3048.00 → 3049.64] upon wave of
[3049.64 → 3050.64] our sin and the
[3050.64 → 3051.56] sin of the world
[3051.56 → 3053.66] breaking upon
[3053.66 → 3055.32] Jesus' sinless
[3055.32 → 3055.64] soul.
[3057.08 → 3057.28] Right?
[3057.32 → 3058.12] Again and again
[3058.12 → 3058.78] during those three
[3058.78 → 3060.14] dark hours he was
[3060.14 → 3061.46] buffeted by our
[3061.46 → 3063.08] sin as our sin was
[3063.08 → 3065.00] poured out on
[3065.00 → 3065.50] him.
[3066.10 → 3067.26] Right?
[3067.34 → 3067.86] All the
[3067.86 → 3069.82] murders, all of
[3069.82 → 3070.54] the rapes and
[3070.54 → 3071.42] pillages of all
[3071.42 → 3072.16] the armies that
[3072.16 → 3072.82] have ever marched
[3072.82 → 3074.62] the earth, all of
[3074.62 → 3075.52] the lies and the
[3075.52 → 3076.84] deceit, all the
[3076.84 → 3077.66] jealousy and the
[3077.66 → 3079.34] ugliness that
[3079.34 → 3080.22] comes from our
[3080.22 → 3081.84] own souls was
[3081.84 → 3083.24] poured out on
[3083.24 → 3085.32] him over and
[3085.32 → 3086.60] over until
[3086.60 → 3087.46] finally what
[3087.46 → 3087.84] happened?
[3088.32 → 3089.14] Finally he
[3089.14 → 3090.72] became a curse
[3090.72 → 3092.12] for us.
[3092.12 → 3095.66] Galatians 3.13
[3095.66 → 3096.22] says,
[3098.00 → 3098.86] Christ redeemed
[3098.86 → 3099.58] us from the
[3099.58 → 3100.16] curse of the
[3100.16 → 3101.42] law by
[3101.42 → 3103.12] becoming a
[3103.12 → 3104.38] curse for
[3104.38 → 3104.82] us.
[3105.88 → 3106.84] For it is
[3106.84 → 3107.18] written,
[3107.42 → 3107.92] cursed is
[3107.92 → 3108.58] everyone who
[3108.58 → 3109.30] is hung on a
[3109.30 → 3109.50] tree.
[3111.44 → 3112.36] When Jesus
[3112.36 → 3113.42] became sin,
[3113.50 → 3114.22] when he became
[3114.22 → 3114.84] a curse,
[3115.98 → 3117.12] the father in
[3117.12 → 3119.50] horror had to
[3119.50 → 3120.18] turn his face
[3120.18 → 3120.50] away.
[3121.94 → 3122.64] And Jesus,
[3122.84 → 3123.34] who had never
[3123.34 → 3123.84] known a
[3123.84 → 3125.08] millisecond of
[3125.08 → 3126.06] separation from
[3126.06 → 3126.80] the father and
[3126.80 → 3127.34] the spirit,
[3127.84 → 3129.54] was judged for
[3129.54 → 3130.20] our sin.
[3132.18 → 3133.18] This means that
[3133.18 → 3134.84] Jesus, friends,
[3135.00 → 3135.64] this means that
[3135.64 → 3136.64] Jesus was able
[3136.64 → 3138.60] to go so low
[3138.60 → 3140.42] that he could
[3140.42 → 3141.80] get under the
[3141.80 → 3142.96] lowest of
[3142.96 → 3143.30] sinners.
[3143.30 → 3144.80] so that he
[3144.80 → 3145.48] could then lift
[3145.48 → 3147.40] us up to
[3147.40 → 3149.00] unimaginable
[3149.00 → 3149.84] heights.
[3151.36 → 3152.02] You know, I
[3152.02 → 3152.68] think of all the
[3152.68 → 3153.22] things that I
[3153.22 → 3155.38] have done that
[3155.38 → 3156.26] I'm aware of.
[3156.84 → 3157.72] All the things
[3157.72 → 3158.90] that I've done
[3158.90 → 3159.34] that I'm not
[3159.34 → 3160.00] aware of.
[3160.12 → 3160.80] And all of
[3160.80 → 3162.12] this was a
[3162.12 → 3163.46] weight on
[3163.46 → 3165.04] Jesus Christ
[3165.04 → 3166.02] crushing him.
[3167.64 → 3167.82] You know,
[3167.84 → 3168.26] maybe we think
[3168.26 → 3169.14] of Atlas
[3169.14 → 3170.50] holding up the
[3170.50 → 3171.08] world on his
[3171.08 → 3171.48] shoulders.
[3171.48 → 3172.46] Well, Jesus
[3172.46 → 3173.48] holding the
[3173.48 → 3174.26] sin of the
[3174.26 → 3175.04] entire cosmos
[3175.04 → 3175.68] on his
[3175.68 → 3176.04] shoulders,
[3176.04 → 3177.10] and he bore
[3177.10 → 3178.28] it all for
[3178.28 → 3178.70] us.
[3180.28 → 3181.38] How beautiful
[3181.38 → 3182.28] is the love
[3182.28 → 3183.10] of God for
[3183.10 → 3183.66] you and me.
[3186.04 → 3187.00] That is the
[3187.00 → 3187.64] heart of Christ,
[3187.70 → 3188.02] that he was
[3188.02 → 3189.48] willing to do
[3189.48 → 3189.80] that.
[3190.80 → 3191.74] And he laid
[3191.74 → 3192.34] down his life
[3192.34 → 3192.80] willingly.
[3194.40 → 3195.18] And how
[3195.18 → 3196.26] serious is our
[3196.26 → 3197.64] sin that he
[3197.64 → 3198.22] had to do
[3198.22 → 3198.50] that.
[3198.50 → 3203.22] that God
[3203.22 → 3203.84] was willing
[3203.84 → 3204.66] to turn
[3204.66 → 3205.26] his face
[3205.26 → 3205.84] away from
[3205.84 → 3206.38] his son
[3206.38 → 3207.62] so that he
[3207.62 → 3208.08] would never
[3208.08 → 3208.64] have to turn
[3208.64 → 3209.24] his face away
[3209.24 → 3209.66] from you
[3209.66 → 3210.58] and from me.
[3210.98 → 3211.52] That he would
[3211.52 → 3212.18] never abandon
[3212.18 → 3213.82] us because he
[3213.82 → 3214.68] abandoned Christ.
[3215.50 → 3216.36] That is the
[3216.36 → 3217.72] heart of God
[3217.72 → 3218.44] the Father in
[3218.44 → 3219.22] Christ for
[3219.22 → 3220.14] you and me.
[3221.50 → 3222.32] But very
[3222.32 → 3223.76] lastly, how
[3223.76 → 3224.48] can we gain
[3224.48 → 3224.96] the heart of
[3224.96 → 3225.42] Christ this
[3225.42 → 3225.70] morning?
[3225.70 → 3226.56] We not only
[3226.56 → 3227.08] want to know
[3227.08 → 3227.50] the heart of
[3227.50 → 3228.06] Christ but we
[3228.06 → 3228.46] want to be
[3228.46 → 3229.26] shaped by it.
[3229.88 → 3230.42] We want that
[3230.42 → 3231.38] heart of Christ
[3231.38 → 3232.76] to become our
[3232.76 → 3233.74] heart as well.
[3235.08 → 3235.70] How are we to
[3235.70 → 3236.32] be like our
[3236.32 → 3237.38] Lord even in
[3237.38 → 3237.88] this?
[3239.48 → 3240.00] Well, you know,
[3240.06 → 3241.16] in our experience
[3241.16 → 3242.20] in this Christian
[3242.20 → 3243.56] life, even after
[3243.56 → 3244.34] we've become a
[3244.34 → 3246.18] Christian, God
[3246.18 → 3246.94] can still feel
[3246.94 → 3248.28] distant to us.
[3249.42 → 3249.82] Right?
[3249.92 → 3250.84] God can sound
[3250.84 → 3251.56] silent.
[3252.66 → 3253.46] We can feel
[3253.46 → 3254.52] abandoned by the
[3254.52 → 3255.28] presence of the
[3255.28 → 3255.56] Spirit.
[3256.70 → 3257.52] We all know
[3257.52 → 3258.62] this at times,
[3258.76 → 3259.36] this what's
[3259.36 → 3259.96] called the dark
[3259.96 → 3260.68] night of the
[3260.68 → 3260.94] soul.
[3262.70 → 3263.66] And what we
[3263.66 → 3264.48] see in this
[3264.48 → 3265.10] word from the
[3265.10 → 3265.78] cross is that
[3265.78 → 3267.00] Jesus experienced
[3267.00 → 3267.82] the same thing
[3267.82 → 3269.10] that we experience
[3269.10 → 3269.60] sometimes.
[3270.54 → 3270.74] Right?
[3270.82 → 3271.48] He knows what
[3271.48 → 3272.28] it's like to be
[3272.28 → 3272.64] us.
[3273.36 → 3273.94] He knows what
[3273.94 → 3274.52] it's like to
[3274.52 → 3275.14] feel that God
[3275.14 → 3276.84] isn't with us
[3276.84 → 3277.36] and he's not
[3277.36 → 3278.36] there when we
[3278.36 → 3279.06] cry out.
[3280.74 → 3281.50] But even
[3281.50 → 3282.16] during the
[3282.16 → 3283.10] silence of the
[3283.10 → 3283.92] abandonment,
[3284.12 → 3285.08] Jesus trusted the
[3285.08 → 3285.32] Father.
[3286.36 → 3287.14] The silence was
[3287.14 → 3288.64] painful, but he
[3288.64 → 3289.50] believed that the
[3289.50 → 3290.32] silence would not
[3290.32 → 3290.98] last forever.
[3292.50 → 3293.24] And friends, we are
[3293.24 → 3293.92] to live by the
[3293.92 → 3295.40] same faith, like
[3295.40 → 3296.20] that of our Lord.
[3296.28 → 3296.96] We are to live by
[3296.96 → 3298.32] the same hope, like
[3298.32 → 3299.02] that of Christ.
[3300.32 → 3301.96] So even in those
[3301.96 → 3303.52] times when we feel
[3303.52 → 3304.88] abandoned, and when
[3304.88 → 3306.40] we cry out to God,
[3306.92 → 3307.86] we can know and
[3307.86 → 3309.04] trust that Jesus was
[3309.04 → 3310.20] abandoned so that we
[3310.20 → 3311.70] would never truly have
[3311.70 → 3312.02] to be.
[3312.02 → 3314.00] And because of
[3314.00 → 3314.44] that, we can
[3314.44 → 3315.30] always trust our
[3315.30 → 3316.70] Heavenly Father, that
[3316.70 → 3317.52] he is with us no
[3317.52 → 3318.18] matter what we
[3318.18 → 3318.60] face.
[3319.66 → 3320.86] He went through all
[3320.86 → 3321.10] of that.
[3321.18 → 3321.96] He abandoned his
[3321.96 → 3323.92] own son so that he
[3323.92 → 3325.20] would never have to
[3325.20 → 3325.68] abandon you.
[3325.84 → 3326.44] And that means he's
[3326.44 → 3328.08] not going to, or
[3328.08 → 3328.62] else he wouldn't have
[3328.62 → 3329.24] put his son through
[3329.24 → 3329.48] that.
[3330.94 → 3332.14] The Spirit is always
[3332.14 → 3333.98] with us, even in the
[3333.98 → 3334.78] darkest of valleys.
[3334.78 → 3337.16] So let me pray for
[3337.16 → 3337.52] us.
[3340.44 → 3343.42] Heavenly Father, here
[3343.42 → 3344.60] we are before you.
[3345.56 → 3346.54] We are in your
[3346.54 → 3346.94] presence.
[3348.40 → 3349.48] We thank you for
[3349.48 → 3350.58] your great love for
[3350.58 → 3351.00] us.
[3352.70 → 3353.44] And Lord, for those
[3353.44 → 3354.20] of us who feel
[3354.20 → 3355.68] abandoned by you, give
[3355.68 → 3357.02] us the faith to trust
[3357.02 → 3358.18] your presence and your
[3358.18 → 3358.48] love.
[3359.98 → 3361.00] For those of us
[3361.00 → 3362.22] discouraged by your
[3362.22 → 3364.54] silence, give us hope
[3364.54 → 3366.56] and speak to us.
[3367.96 → 3368.78] And Lord, would you
[3368.78 → 3370.06] remove every obstacle,
[3370.22 → 3370.96] every sin in our
[3370.96 → 3371.90] lives that would hinder
[3371.90 → 3373.06] our ability to hear
[3373.06 → 3374.66] your voice, to know
[3374.66 → 3375.18] your presence.
[3376.28 → 3377.64] And Holy Spirit, give
[3377.64 → 3378.68] us the faith, the hope,
[3378.70 → 3380.04] and the courage to dwell
[3380.04 → 3380.84] in your love.
[3381.92 → 3383.64] In Jesus' name we pray.
[3384.64 → 3385.04] Amen.
[3388.76 → 3389.56] Let's stand.
[3390.40 → 3391.86] Let's sing our song
[3391.86 → 3392.70] of response together.
[3394.54 → 3402.84] Peter,
[3402.84 → 3403.96] Thomas.
[3403.96 → 3405.88] Zeke,
[3405.88 → 3408.10] Thomas.
[3408.10 → 3421.56] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3421.56 → 3427.14] I find a place to stand
[3427.14 → 3432.26] And in wonder of such mercy
[3432.26 → 3437.64] That calls me as I am
[3437.64 → 3442.92] For hands that should list for me
[3442.92 → 3448.04] Of wounds which till me come
[3448.04 → 3453.50] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3453.50 → 3459.10] My worthy soul is found
[3459.10 → 3466.98] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3466.98 → 3472.26] His family is my own
[3472.26 → 3478.12] All are strangers chasing selfish dreams
[3478.12 → 3482.26] Now one through grace alone
[3482.26 → 3487.54] How could I not dishonour
[3487.54 → 3493.70] The ones that you have held
[3493.70 → 3498.26] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3498.26 → 3503.54] See the children called by God
[3503.54 → 3512.26] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3512.26 → 3517.54] The path before the ground
[3517.54 → 3522.82] We follow in His footsteps
[3522.82 → 3527.94] Where promised hope is found
[3527.94 → 3533.14] How great the joy before us
[3533.14 → 3537.82] To be His perfect bride
[3537.82 → 3543.10] Beneath the cross of Jesus
[3543.10 → 3549.10] We will gladly live our lives
[3549.10 → 3567.02] In response to God's grace for us
[3567.02 → 3568.66] We now continue our worship
[3568.66 → 3571.42] At the time when we give our tithes and our offerings
[3571.42 → 3573.62] As gifts to God
[3573.62 → 3576.70] Our designated offering for this Sunday
[3576.70 → 3578.40] Is World Renew
[3578.40 → 3581.00] For Ukraine
[3581.00 → 3583.14] And, so I want to read
[3583.14 → 3584.56] Just a bit of what
[3584.56 → 3587.22] Their explanation for what they will do
[3587.22 → 3588.04] With these funds
[3588.04 → 3590.50] World Renew is our denomination's
[3590.50 → 3593.90] Disaster relief
[3593.90 → 3596.04] Part of what they do is disaster relief work
[3596.04 → 3597.56] So this is what they say
[3597.56 → 3600.20] We are working with our global networks
[3600.20 → 3600.92] In the region
[3600.92 → 3603.00] To respond to the needs
[3603.00 → 3604.34] Of vulnerable families
[3604.34 → 3606.12] Impacted by the conflict in Ukraine
[3606.12 → 3609.32] We are supporting our peer organizations
[3609.32 → 3611.52] By providing essential items
[3611.52 → 3613.10] For people fleeing for safety
[3613.10 → 3614.34] To neighbouring countries
[3614.34 → 3615.84] In Slovakia
[3615.84 → 3617.68] We are providing temporary shelters
[3617.68 → 3619.48] Emergency food
[3619.48 → 3621.64] And emergency non-food items
[3621.64 → 3623.94] Such as blankets, linens, mattresses
[3623.94 → 3625.64] And basic hygiene items
[3625.64 → 3626.76] In Romania
[3626.76 → 3627.38] In Poland
[3627.38 → 3628.28] We are responding
[3628.28 → 3629.84] With health support
[3629.84 → 3632.14] By supplying health packs
[3632.14 → 3633.14] That will be used
[3633.14 → 3634.54] By local health centres
[3634.54 → 3638.86] Yeah
[3638.86 → 3639.44] Okay
[3639.44 → 3641.06] So that's
[3641.06 → 3641.76] That's the explanation
[3641.76 → 3644.04] So maybe we can invite
[3644.04 → 3645.56] Our ushers to come forward
[3645.56 → 3646.32] To collect the offering
[3646.32 → 3647.72] And if you are a guest with us today
[3647.72 → 3649.30] We're glad you're here
[3649.30 → 3650.12] And please do not feel
[3650.12 → 3651.36] Any obligation to
[3651.36 → 3652.16] To give
[3652.16 → 3660.04] A naive
[3660.98 → 3661.10] Adele
[3661.10 → 3661.70] Tell us
[3661.70 → 3662.10] To die
[3662.10 → 3662.46] For our love
[3662.46 → 3662.66] Let USAM
[3662.66 → 3663.10] To die
[3663.70 → 3665.08] From the night
[3665.08 → 3665.74] And then we
[3665.74 → 3666.42] If you find
[3666.42 → 3666.70] Some LL
[3666.70 → 3667.44] Our love
[3667.44 → 3668.02] For our love
[3668.02 → 3669.56] Oh
[3669.56 → 3670.38] To die
[3670.38 → 3670.72] For our love
[3670.72 → 3672.60] And then we're here
[3672.60 → 3672.62] Here we go
[3672.62 → 3673.62] Amen.
[3702.62 → 3703.62] Amen.
[3732.62 → 3734.62] Amen.
[3744.62 → 3746.54] Amen.
[3746.54 → 3767.46] So let us, as a church family, come before the Lord in a prayer of supplication,
[3767.60 → 3771.00] intercession for the world, for those in our own community.
[3771.00 → 3777.22] We'll pray for Janet Ram, who did experience some health challenges this week.
[3778.44 → 3785.26] She went to the hospital for some tests and is being monitored, but is able to be at home now.
[3785.68 → 3792.58] And she is very thankful for the providential care of the Lord as the family and friends
[3792.58 → 3795.64] were able to provide for her during that incident.
[3795.64 → 3805.12] Also, we'll continue to pray for Joan as her family is still with her, and she is still with us at the hospice.
[3806.00 → 3807.36] So we'll also pray for Ukraine.
[3807.74 → 3810.36] So let's first, let's come before the Lord, we'll pray for Ukraine first.
[3810.86 → 3811.26] Let's pray.
[3813.76 → 3817.68] Our Creator God, Lord of all, our Prince of Peace,
[3817.68 → 3822.76] we come to you in this time of conflict in Ukraine.
[3823.96 → 3832.76] Our hearts are heavy with all the precious lives we hold and with the reality of the violence so many are experiencing.
[3833.50 → 3835.04] So Lord, we pray for peace.
[3835.82 → 3842.50] We pray for those who are in positions to make decisions that can create a way for peace.
[3842.50 → 3847.32] May you grant wisdom to world leaders to bring about a ceasefire.
[3848.74 → 3850.72] And Lord, we pray that you would give them wisdom.
[3851.58 → 3858.10] We pray for those who are not in positions of power and yet boldly are standing and marching for peace to come.
[3859.18 → 3864.44] May you grant protection for the people who are caught in the crosshairs of hostilities.
[3864.44 → 3894.42] May you grant protection for peace to come.
[3894.44 → 3895.50] May you grant protection for peace to come.
[3895.50 → 3895.78] May you grant protection for peace to come.
[3895.78 → 3899.00] May you grant protection for peace that you call us to live in the peace that you desire for all nations to have.
[3899.56 → 3902.68] And we thank you, Lord, most of all that you, the Prince of Peace,
[3903.34 → 3906.08] will one day reign as Lord over all,
[3906.16 → 3909.58] and you will bring peace to all nations and all hearts.
[3911.36 → 3920.66] Father, we also think about the trials of our own lives and of those we love.
[3921.62 → 3924.96] Jesus, you know the anguish of our human lives.
[3925.84 → 3928.98] As the one who sees the pain of those who suffer,
[3930.26 → 3933.84] Lord, would you bring comfort and peace and strength?
[3934.90 → 3937.42] We especially, Lord, pray for Janet,
[3937.92 → 3939.96] that you would help her to recover well.
[3940.08 → 3942.84] Would you surround her with your peace and your healing power?
[3943.76 → 3947.18] Lord, we thank you for the care that she was able to see
[3947.18 → 3948.96] in those around her who helped her.
[3948.96 → 3954.50] Lord, we also lift to you Joan and Jerry in this time.
[3954.58 → 3957.08] We also lift to you their children
[3957.08 → 3960.48] who are all gathered and with Joan
[3960.48 → 3964.42] who is still in hospice in her last moments of life.
[3965.70 → 3970.76] Lord, we thank you for this time of being together.
[3971.12 → 3975.52] But Lord, even as they mourn the loss of a wife and a mother,
[3976.02 → 3977.20] Lord, would you comfort them?
[3977.20 → 3982.94] And Lord, would you take Joan home to be with you quickly,
[3983.32 → 3984.42] but in your time, Lord.
[3987.08 → 3993.00] Lord, for others who experience the agony and the tears of losing loved ones,
[3993.94 → 3996.30] we pray that you'd comfort all who grieve.
[3997.32 → 4001.54] As one who wept over the faithlessness of your people,
[4001.54 → 4006.58] Lord, would you send your spirit to correct us in our unfaithfulness.
[4007.88 → 4010.80] As one who was once forsaken by all others,
[4011.08 → 4015.56] Lord, would you give hope and assurance to those who feel alone and abandoned today.
[4017.62 → 4022.94] As one who knows violence and experienced it yourself,
[4023.00 → 4028.68] would you bring peace and healing to those who suffer physical trouble.
[4028.68 → 4035.74] You, our Lord, have offered up prayers with loud cries and tears,
[4035.86 → 4038.38] and so we ask that you would hear us when we do the same.
[4039.64 → 4043.86] We approach your throne of grace, Lord, this morning with boldness.
[4044.62 → 4048.70] May we receive mercy and grace in our time of need.
[4048.70 → 4055.22] We pray all these things in the name of our Lord, our crucified Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[4055.82 → 4056.16] Amen.
