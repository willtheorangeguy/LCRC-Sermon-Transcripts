[306.00 --> 307.00]  Amen.
[307.00 --> 308.00]  Good morning.
[308.00 --> 309.00]  Good morning.
[309.00 --> 312.00]  And welcome here this morning.
[312.00 --> 317.00]  To everyone, whether you've been coming for decades or years, whether you're a visitor
[317.00 --> 323.00]  today or whether you're joining us online, we're very happy that you're here.
[323.00 --> 327.00]  My name is Marian and I will be our worship leader today.
[327.00 --> 334.00]  And later in the service, Pastor Jason is going to delve more deeply into the topic of family
[334.00 --> 336.00]  from the book of Ephesians.
[336.00 --> 343.00]  Also, we would like you to please join us in the fellowship hall after the service for refreshments.
[343.00 --> 347.00]  And it's a good time to visit with one another.
[347.00 --> 353.00]  And it's also a good time to say our farewells to Hans.
[353.00 --> 355.00]  Is Hans here this morning?
[355.00 --> 356.00]  Oh, there you are.
[356.00 --> 357.00]  Sorry.
[357.00 --> 364.00]  Hans has been here for many, many years and he is moving next weekend to Elam.
[364.00 --> 366.00]  And we are sad to see him go.
[366.00 --> 371.00]  He has been a great help to this church in many ways over the years.
[371.00 --> 374.00]  And Hans, may God go with you.
[374.00 --> 380.00]  And we know that you will bless those in your community where you go.
[380.00 --> 386.00]  So take the opportunity to say farewell to him today as well.
[386.00 --> 391.00]  We have each come here today for various reasons.
[391.00 --> 397.00]  But God delights in our presence so that we can meet with him heart to heart with our unchanging,
[397.00 --> 405.00]  faithful father, our redeeming savior and our greatest comforter, the Holy Spirit.
[405.00 --> 413.00]  May we all be changed in some way today by his care for us and our attention to him here this morning.
[413.00 --> 416.00]  Would you please pray with me?
[416.00 --> 426.00]  Gracious, welcoming God, as we gather here for this short time, may our focus be unhindered by the cares we brought with us this morning.
[426.00 --> 436.00]  We lay them at your feet, knowing that you are able to redeem anything that affects or afflicts us.
[436.00 --> 440.00]  We admit that we need you to comfort us and make us whole.
[440.00 --> 450.00]  We want to enjoy you here, now, as we look to you in worship and adoration and prepare to be changed by your spirit.
[450.00 --> 451.00]  Amen.
[451.00 --> 455.00]  Would you please rise for the call to worship?
[455.00 --> 464.00]  Shout with joy to the Lord all the earth.
[464.00 --> 466.00]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[466.00 --> 469.00]  Come before him, singing with joy.
[469.00 --> 472.00]  For the Lord is good.
[472.00 --> 475.00]  His unfailing love continues forever.
[475.00 --> 480.00]  And his faithfulness continues to each generation.
[480.00 --> 484.00]  Our greeting this morning comes from 2 Peter 1.
[484.00 --> 491.00]  Grace and peace be ours abundantly through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[491.00 --> 493.00]  Amen.
[493.00 --> 494.00]  Please take a moment to greet one another.
[494.00 --> 496.00]  Please take a moment to greet one another.
[496.00 --> 503.00]  We are here to follow our greeting.
[503.00 --> 532.98]  Thank you.
[533.00 --> 562.98]  Thank you.
[563.00 --> 565.00]  Thank you.
[593.00 --> 595.00]  Thank you.
[623.00 --> 625.00]  Thank you.
[625.00 --> 627.00]  Thank you.
[655.00 --> 657.00]  Thank you.
[657.00 --> 659.00]  Thank you.
[659.00 --> 661.00]  Thank you.
[661.00 --> 663.00]  Thank you.
[663.00 --> 665.00]  Thank you.
[665.00 --> 667.00]  Thank you.
[667.00 --> 669.00]  Thank you.
[669.00 --> 671.00]  Thank you.
[671.00 --> 673.00]  Thank you.
[673.00 --> 675.00]  Thank you.
[675.00 --> 677.00]  Thank you.
[677.00 --> 679.00]  Thank you.
[679.00 --> 681.00]  Thank you.
[681.00 --> 683.00]  Thank you.
[683.00 --> 685.00]  Thank you.
[685.00 --> 687.00]  Thank you.
[687.00 --> 689.00]  Thank you.
[689.00 --> 691.00]  Thank you.
[691.00 --> 693.00]  Thank you.
[693.00 --> 695.00]  Thank you.
[695.00 --> 697.00]  Thank you.
[697.00 --> 699.00]  Thank you.
[699.00 --> 701.00]  Thank you.
[701.00 --> 703.00]  Every word at last accomplished.
[703.00 --> 707.00]  Heaven sings and earth replies.
[707.00 --> 710.88]  To our God be the glory.
[710.88 --> 714.00]  Let our creation cry.
[714.00 --> 723.22]  Praise and honor to Christ, word of God, word of life.
[744.00 --> 750.18]  We won't fear the battle, we won't fear the night.
[750.18 --> 755.04]  We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[755.48 --> 759.82]  You will go before us, you will lead the way.
[760.48 --> 765.04]  We have found our refuge, only you can save.
[766.48 --> 771.20]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[771.20 --> 775.20]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[776.08 --> 780.44]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[780.88 --> 786.38]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[794.18 --> 799.00]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall,
[799.00 --> 803.88]  Even when I turn back, still your love is sure.
[804.30 --> 808.52]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake.
[808.98 --> 813.64]  You will cheer me onward, my memory raise.
[814.84 --> 819.60]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[819.94 --> 823.90]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[823.90 --> 828.68]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[829.04 --> 834.64]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[834.64 --> 847.24]  Neither height nor depth can separate us.
[847.24 --> 851.92]  Hell and death will not defeat us.
[852.02 --> 859.64]  He who gave his Son to free us holds me in his love.
[859.64 --> 885.78]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[885.78 --> 889.78]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[890.54 --> 894.70]  Raise your voice now, no love is greater.
[895.18 --> 900.76]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[900.76 --> 909.46]  Give us just a unified battle.
[909.48 --> 913.60]  Let us hear what we call the Lord of anyommes would
[913.60 --> 915.14]  "...year Totem."
[915.16 --> 919.50]  We will restore you, God,
[919.50 --> 924.44]  Like Jesus...
[924.44 --> 938.30]  We will restore you, God and King, and bless your holy name.
[938.30 --> 949.66]  Day after day, we'll sing your praise forever and forever.
[949.66 --> 956.20]  One generation will call to the next.
[956.62 --> 962.32]  Our God is good and His hand is strong.
[962.32 --> 967.96]  All of the world sings His marvelous acts.
[968.44 --> 975.30]  And our voice will join with this in the song.
[975.30 --> 982.30]  Great is the Lord in all His ways.
[983.26 --> 987.30]  It's greatly to be praised.
[989.30 --> 993.30]  Worry to search for endless days.
[993.30 --> 1000.46]  His greatness none could fathom.
[1000.94 --> 1006.02]  One generation will call to the next.
[1006.52 --> 1012.14]  Our God is good and His hand is strong.
[1012.14 --> 1017.78]  God of the world sings His marvelous acts.
[1017.78 --> 1025.78]  And our voice will join with tears in the song.
[1027.38 --> 1038.18]  Now may your name be sung in every tongue, in every place.
[1038.18 --> 1048.94]  Singing the flame of your great love in every generation.
[1050.14 --> 1055.46]  One generation will call to the next.
[1055.88 --> 1061.42]  Our God is good and His hand is strong.
[1061.42 --> 1066.86]  Of the world sings His marvelous acts.
[1066.86 --> 1074.54]  And our voice will join with tears in the song.
[1076.88 --> 1077.80]  Please be seated.
[1091.42 --> 1096.36]  Each week we pause to reflect on how we live in this world.
[1097.06 --> 1100.10]  Especially in the context of God's desire for us.
[1100.90 --> 1103.54]  This is what we might call a reality check.
[1104.64 --> 1109.46]  The Bible says that if we say that we have no sin, that we are lying.
[1110.18 --> 1111.62]  The truth is not in us.
[1111.62 --> 1117.18]  In order to be sinless, we only need to do two things.
[1117.92 --> 1119.16]  To love God above all.
[1119.80 --> 1121.48]  And to love our neighbor as ourself.
[1122.58 --> 1123.28]  Easy, right?
[1125.16 --> 1126.02]  Sounds easy.
[1126.54 --> 1129.22]  But we are both selfish and fearful.
[1129.78 --> 1131.40]  And so we miss the mark.
[1131.98 --> 1133.34]  By a landslide.
[1134.38 --> 1137.36]  But God doesn't stand waiting to punish us.
[1137.36 --> 1146.20]  On the contrary, the Bible also teaches us that if we confess our sins, God will forgive our sins and cleanse us.
[1147.18 --> 1148.18]  Let's pray together.
[1151.54 --> 1159.64]  Lord, we come this morning to confess our selfishness and our fear of what's happening around us and in us.
[1160.52 --> 1163.40]  We fear that if we give, we won't have enough.
[1163.40 --> 1168.84]  We fear that if we mingle with those different from us, we will be uncomfortable.
[1169.64 --> 1171.40]  And maybe even tainted in some way.
[1173.00 --> 1179.08]  We fear that our children and grandchildren won't have the wisdom and skills they need to navigate this broken world.
[1180.58 --> 1186.10]  We sometimes even fear that you have turned your face away from us and from your creation.
[1186.10 --> 1191.34]  Our fear often leads us to act out and to react in sinful ways.
[1192.50 --> 1193.78]  Forgive us for this, Lord.
[1194.76 --> 1198.96]  Give us hearts to love you above all and our family and neighbors as ourselves.
[1200.14 --> 1203.30]  Help us to walk by faith rather than by sight.
[1203.30 --> 1221.34]  Thank you for your redeeming love through Jesus, who gave himself in the most complete way possible by dying so that we could receive your forgiveness and be in a loving relationship with you, our Father.
[1222.26 --> 1225.70]  We are humbled and overwhelmed by this gift.
[1226.66 --> 1227.22]  Thank you.
[1227.82 --> 1228.18]  Amen.
[1228.18 --> 1236.52]  Romans 8, verses 37 to 39 in the Living Bible Translation.
[1236.72 --> 1237.64]  I kind of like that one.
[1237.72 --> 1238.08]  It says,
[1238.08 --> 1247.26]  But despite all this, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us enough to die for us.
[1248.10 --> 1253.68]  For I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love.
[1254.70 --> 1256.96]  Death can't and life can't.
[1256.96 --> 1258.74]  The angels won't.
[1258.74 --> 1258.76]  The angels won't.
[1259.26 --> 1264.36]  And all the powers of hell itself cannot keep God's love away.
[1265.42 --> 1274.94]  Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, or where we are, high above the sky or in the deepest ocean,
[1276.00 --> 1285.16]  nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of God demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ when he died for us.
[1285.16 --> 1286.98]  a long mile before us.
[1286.98 --> 1289.04]  Let's sing, I will sing of my Redeemer.
[1289.04 --> 1289.86]  Let's sing.
[1289.86 --> 1291.16]  Let's sing.
[1303.56 --> 1306.92]  Let's sing.
[1308.20 --> 1310.54]  Let's sing.
[1310.54 --> 1320.44]  Sing, O my Redeemer, and His wondrous love to me.
[1320.44 --> 1331.70]  On the cruel cross He suffered, from the curse He set me free.
[1331.70 --> 1342.56]  Sing, O sing, O my Redeemer, with His blood He purchased me.
[1343.06 --> 1353.10]  On the cross He sealed my pardon, paid my debt, and made me free.
[1353.10 --> 1365.82]  I will praise my dear Redeemer, His triumphant power I'll tell.
[1366.40 --> 1377.04]  How the victory given, over sin and death and hell.
[1377.04 --> 1387.74]  Sing, O sing, O my Redeemer, with His blood He purchased me.
[1388.64 --> 1398.54]  On the cross He sealed my pardon, paid the debt, and made me free.
[1398.54 --> 1411.14]  I will sing of my Redeemer, and His heavenly love to me.
[1411.14 --> 1422.14]  Heard me from death to life has brought me, Son of God with Him to me.
[1422.14 --> 1433.74]  Sing, O sing, O sing, O my Redeemer, with His blood He purchased me.
[1433.74 --> 1444.68]  On the cross He sealed my pardon, paid the debt, and made me free.
[1444.68 --> 1459.86]  The children, ages 3 to grade 5, are now dismissed to go to Kids Life.
[1461.08 --> 1465.28]  And we hope that you have a wonderful time in Kids Life this morning.
[1465.28 --> 1465.36]  Amen.
[1474.68 --> 1490.52]  Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[1491.00 --> 1495.10]  Honor your fodder and mutter, which is the first commandment with a promise,
[1495.50 --> 1499.72]  so that it may go well with you, and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.
[1499.72 --> 1502.66]  Father, do not exasperate your children.
[1503.20 --> 1506.94]  Instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
[1507.64 --> 1509.08]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1509.72 --> 1510.90]  Thanks be to God.
[1524.38 --> 1525.12]  Thank you, John.
[1529.72 --> 1530.96]  So good morning to you all.
[1530.96 --> 1531.80]  Good morning.
[1533.60 --> 1541.78]  So today, I'd like to talk about the place of families in the kingdom of God.
[1542.74 --> 1546.00]  We've been working our way through the book of Ephesians,
[1546.60 --> 1552.28]  and now we're getting into the section where Paul begins to talk about human relationships.
[1553.26 --> 1557.76]  We looked at the relationship between wives and husbands last week,
[1557.76 --> 1564.58]  and now we are looking at the relationship between children and parents.
[1565.78 --> 1570.72]  So as we prepare to open God's word together, let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[1571.34 --> 1572.04]  Please pray with me.
[1573.62 --> 1579.10]  Dear Heavenly Father, we ask your blessing on us now.
[1579.10 --> 1587.48]  Give us your grace that we might know you and know your word and truth.
[1587.88 --> 1589.62]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1590.42 --> 1590.82]  Amen.
[1590.82 --> 1590.90]  Amen.
[1593.22 --> 1595.50]  So this week, I learned about an artist.
[1595.82 --> 1597.58]  His name is Benjamin West.
[1598.02 --> 1599.20]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[1599.24 --> 1600.82]  He's a British-American artist.
[1601.54 --> 1602.82]  He was born in 1738.
[1604.00 --> 1605.64]  And I'll show you one of his paintings.
[1606.44 --> 1611.02]  This is just, it's not related to the story, but just to give you a sense of his style,
[1611.52 --> 1614.50]  which was neoclassical, I also learned from Wikipedia.
[1614.50 --> 1621.74]  So this painting is called Isaac's Servant Tying the Bracelet on Rebecca's Arm.
[1622.14 --> 1623.96]  So it's painted in 1775.
[1625.52 --> 1630.46]  So the reason I bring this up, though, is because of this story that Benjamin West tells.
[1630.64 --> 1638.00]  He tells a story that when he was a young boy, one day his mother went out of the house,
[1638.70 --> 1641.80]  leaving him in charge of his younger sister, Sally.
[1641.80 --> 1651.68]  He decided it's a good opportunity to get out his colored inks and paint his sister's portrait.
[1652.76 --> 1656.52]  And he says that he made an awful mess.
[1657.30 --> 1659.30]  He got ink everywhere.
[1660.52 --> 1662.42]  And so his mother came home.
[1663.40 --> 1670.78]  And if it was me, and I came home, and I found ink everywhere, I would have gotten angry.
[1670.78 --> 1672.94]  I would have yelled.
[1673.28 --> 1674.30]  I would have scolded.
[1675.30 --> 1678.44]  I know this from many similar experiences.
[1680.24 --> 1687.18]  But when Benjamin's West mother came home, she said nothing about the ink stains that were everywhere.
[1687.64 --> 1692.34]  Instead, she picked up the portrait of his sister that he had been working on.
[1692.34 --> 1696.64]  And she said, why, it looks just like Sally.
[1697.74 --> 1700.30]  And then she bent over and kissed him.
[1701.80 --> 1707.42]  Benjamin West said, my mother's kiss made me a painter.
[1707.42 --> 1712.40]  I think it's such a, you know, it's a heartwarming story.
[1712.50 --> 1713.50]  It's an amazing story.
[1713.50 --> 1722.16]  Because it shows how the love and the encouragement of a parent has the power to cause a child to blossom and to grow.
[1722.16 --> 1728.44]  But we also know that parenting is hard.
[1729.70 --> 1734.16]  The parent-child relationship has great potential for joy.
[1734.86 --> 1744.40]  But it also has the potential to put a spotlight on our weaknesses more probably than any other relationship.
[1744.40 --> 1749.50]  There's a famous quote by the 17th century writer John Wilmot.
[1750.50 --> 1754.76]  And he says this, before I got married, I had six theories about raising children.
[1755.48 --> 1757.18]  Now I have six children.
[1758.56 --> 1759.66]  And no theories.
[1761.40 --> 1761.92]  Right?
[1761.98 --> 1765.50]  If you've ever cared for young children, you can probably relate to this, right?
[1765.50 --> 1772.22]  Because children are really good at wrecking our theories about parenting.
[1773.34 --> 1777.50]  But here in Ephesians, Paul doesn't just give us some theories about parenting.
[1777.94 --> 1785.26]  Rather, he's talking about how to order our most important relationships in the kingdom of God.
[1785.52 --> 1792.78]  Relationships that he talks about in this section of husband and wife, parent and child, and slave and master, or employers.
[1792.78 --> 1797.14]  And there are many other relationships, but these are the three that he talks about.
[1798.02 --> 1804.86]  And he gives us a guiding principle that applies to all of our relationships.
[1805.50 --> 1809.32]  And that principle is found in chapter 5, verse 21.
[1810.84 --> 1812.10]  Here's what it says.
[1812.86 --> 1818.40]  Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[1818.40 --> 1831.20]  And once we hear this, we are now ready to think about our relationships, not only as in marriage or in the workplace, but also in the family.
[1833.20 --> 1835.42]  And so this sermon is for children.
[1836.52 --> 1837.74]  And it is for parents.
[1837.74 --> 1842.92]  Now, we already sent most of our children to Sunday school.
[1843.82 --> 1852.52]  But children, for those of you who are here, how does God want you to submit to your parents?
[1854.26 --> 1858.16]  What are your duties to God?
[1859.20 --> 1862.44]  What does God say to you and ask of you?
[1862.44 --> 1868.94]  And all of us, as human beings, are children, right?
[1869.18 --> 1870.02]  In one way or another.
[1870.20 --> 1876.22]  And for a lot of us, we are still called, even though we are older, to honor our parents.
[1876.28 --> 1877.84]  So in a way, this applies to all of us.
[1879.60 --> 1881.78]  And then it also is a word to parents.
[1881.94 --> 1885.58]  Parents, how does God want you to submit to your children?
[1885.86 --> 1887.14]  Now, that sounds a little bit strange.
[1887.14 --> 1892.70]  But we can do that in a certain kind of way that Paul talks about here.
[1893.20 --> 1895.12]  How does God want us to submit to our children?
[1895.38 --> 1896.76]  What does he ask of us?
[1898.16 --> 1900.34]  So this morning, we're going to look at those questions.
[1901.38 --> 1907.90]  First, how does Paul, what does Paul have to say to children?
[1907.90 --> 1914.20]  And the first thing to notice right away is that God, speaking through the Apostle Paul,
[1914.42 --> 1917.56]  he speaks to children, right?
[1917.60 --> 1920.50]  He's not saying, parents, tell your children.
[1921.30 --> 1924.46]  He's speaking right to the children.
[1925.70 --> 1928.02]  And this means some interesting things.
[1928.58 --> 1930.48]  Well, first, let's read the verse.
[1930.58 --> 1936.36]  Verse 1 says, children, obey your parents and the Lord, for this is right.
[1936.36 --> 1936.84]  Right?
[1937.64 --> 1940.44]  And so this is pretty interesting for a couple reasons.
[1940.60 --> 1943.72]  First, it tells us that God cares for children.
[1944.42 --> 1946.46]  He wants to talk to them, right?
[1946.58 --> 1951.60]  He has a relationship with them, right?
[1951.68 --> 1956.42]  Yes, they are our children, but they belong to God.
[1957.26 --> 1960.52]  And God cares for them, and he addresses them.
[1960.60 --> 1965.20]  He wants to have a relationship with them, so he talks to them.
[1965.20 --> 1971.16]  But let's also think for a moment about the practical implications of this letter.
[1971.56 --> 1980.44]  Ephesians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul, and he sends it out to the churches to be read aloud in the worship service.
[1981.36 --> 1988.82]  And here in the middle of this letter, being read in worship like we're doing, there's a passage that speaks to the kids.
[1988.82 --> 1994.86]  And so I think we can safely conclude that Paul is expecting children to be there.
[1995.68 --> 1996.18]  Right?
[1996.24 --> 2003.02]  He's expecting the children to be present in the assembly so that they can hear these verses.
[2004.78 --> 2009.28]  Paul cared about the kids as well as the adults.
[2009.28 --> 2017.06]  He wanted to help them to know Jesus and to follow Jesus just as much as he wants to help the adults do the same.
[2018.12 --> 2023.34]  Paul assumed children would be present and that they could be preached to.
[2024.74 --> 2026.74]  And so everything in the book of Ephesians, right?
[2027.26 --> 2030.54]  Though some of it is more challenging and difficult for all of us,
[2031.24 --> 2036.12]  all of it can be given to our children as well as to our adults.
[2036.12 --> 2038.80]  And the church is meant to be intergenerational.
[2040.10 --> 2045.40]  And so I believe, practically speaking, that our practice here at Latin or CRC is well-grounded.
[2045.76 --> 2049.20]  We welcome and encourage children to be part of our worship service.
[2050.06 --> 2052.74]  We believe that it is good for the children to be here,
[2053.04 --> 2057.16]  and it is good for the adults, for them to be here,
[2057.28 --> 2060.68]  even if sometimes they are a little bit distracting.
[2060.68 --> 2065.40]  Now, it is true that when they are younger,
[2066.00 --> 2069.82]  the children go to Sunday school during the sermon so that they can hear God's word
[2069.82 --> 2073.54]  in a way that they can more easily understand.
[2074.36 --> 2080.96]  But as they get older, they are expected to stay and listen to the sermon with the adults,
[2081.02 --> 2082.02]  to hear God's word.
[2082.02 --> 2090.66]  So we believe that children are given to us to be brought up in the covenant community.
[2091.72 --> 2095.88]  And to the extent that it is possible, we bring our children with us to church
[2095.88 --> 2099.10]  so that they can hear and respond to God's word.
[2099.84 --> 2104.00]  Sometimes it's not easy to bring children to church, especially when they're very young.
[2104.00 --> 2108.26]  But we're in it together, and we can help one another.
[2108.96 --> 2111.02]  So they grow up in this community.
[2111.18 --> 2112.58]  They grow up in the church.
[2112.82 --> 2117.90]  They grow up seeing one another, seeing us worship God and respond to him
[2117.90 --> 2120.08]  and to listen to his word.
[2121.52 --> 2123.24]  So let's keep looking at the passage.
[2123.38 --> 2123.90]  Verse 1,
[2124.18 --> 2127.88]  Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[2128.88 --> 2131.12]  I think it's interesting that Paul doesn't just say,
[2131.12 --> 2136.16]  Children, obey your parents because I said so.
[2136.94 --> 2140.50]  I can imagine Paul's letter being read out loud in the worship.
[2140.66 --> 2143.52]  And the reader gets to this part, and it says,
[2143.80 --> 2145.26]  Children, obey your parents.
[2145.54 --> 2148.72]  And right away, you know, maybe you hear a little voice, speak up.
[2149.32 --> 2149.66]  Why?
[2151.48 --> 2153.60]  You know, maybe Paul has been around two-year-olds,
[2153.80 --> 2155.66]  and he's familiar with this common question.
[2156.58 --> 2157.86]  So Paul talks to the kids.
[2157.86 --> 2160.42]  He doesn't just say, because I told you so.
[2161.08 --> 2163.54]  That's a handy tool to have in the parenting toolbox.
[2164.80 --> 2170.48]  But no, Paul is willing to talk to the kids and give them a reason.
[2170.60 --> 2171.68]  He explains it.
[2172.26 --> 2173.92]  He says, Obey your parents.
[2174.38 --> 2179.38]  Submit to their direction because it is right to do so.
[2180.50 --> 2184.38]  And then in verses 2 and 3, he quotes to them from the Ten Commandments.
[2184.38 --> 2189.62]  He says, Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
[2189.82 --> 2193.66]  so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.
[2194.82 --> 2198.86]  Paul wants the children to know that they have to obey their parents
[2198.86 --> 2204.10]  because this is what God has given us in the law.
[2204.10 --> 2208.62]  And obeying God's law leads to blessing.
[2209.74 --> 2211.72]  God says it is good for the child.
[2212.28 --> 2213.88]  It is good for the family.
[2214.06 --> 2220.22]  It is good for society when children are not rebellious and disobedient and disrespectful.
[2220.22 --> 2224.44]  And God promises that good will follow from this.
[2225.34 --> 2231.76]  Parents, you know, ideally in a perfect world, the way God designed things,
[2231.88 --> 2233.38]  parents have experience of life.
[2234.20 --> 2236.76]  Parents have the child's best interests in mind.
[2236.76 --> 2239.76]  And parents are motivated by wisdom and love.
[2240.74 --> 2244.32]  So Paul says, Children, remember that as you obey your parents,
[2244.62 --> 2245.78]  it's not meaningless.
[2245.98 --> 2252.02]  It's not just because I said so, but it leads to blessing and to flourishing.
[2252.14 --> 2254.12]  This is the way God designed it.
[2255.50 --> 2260.28]  But the obedience of children, it is important to say, does have boundaries.
[2261.08 --> 2262.82]  And it does have stages.
[2262.82 --> 2274.28]  In Matthew 10, the Lord Jesus makes it very clear that allegiance to him overrides even that given to parents.
[2275.24 --> 2281.50]  In our hearts, Jesus is to come before every human relationship.
[2282.32 --> 2283.56]  So that is a boundary.
[2285.34 --> 2288.72]  And a child's obedience does have stages to it.
[2289.04 --> 2292.50]  Children growing up in the home are to obey their parents.
[2292.82 --> 2294.70]  And follow their parents' direction.
[2295.44 --> 2300.76]  But this guardianship of obedience to parents loosens over time.
[2301.58 --> 2307.38]  And in this, the regular healthy process of the child growing in age and maturity.
[2308.58 --> 2316.06]  But even after the child grows up and the child is no longer a child who has to obey every word of the parents,
[2316.06 --> 2317.60]  still they're your parents.
[2317.60 --> 2321.44]  And the Bible calls us to honor them.
[2322.82 --> 2324.84]  That means we love them.
[2325.54 --> 2329.22]  We show them respect and consideration.
[2330.22 --> 2335.56]  And this applies to everyone who has parents, no matter how old you are.
[2336.94 --> 2338.78]  And so that's Paul's instructions to children.
[2338.96 --> 2341.88]  Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[2342.38 --> 2343.64]  Honor your father and mother.
[2343.64 --> 2348.78]  Now Paul switches to then talking to the parents.
[2349.66 --> 2351.06]  So let's look at verse 4.
[2352.18 --> 2352.66]  It says,
[2353.16 --> 2355.66]  Fathers, do not exasperate your children.
[2355.90 --> 2359.92]  Instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
[2360.86 --> 2366.24]  Now, it's important to notice that it specifies fathers.
[2366.24 --> 2370.52]  Now, yes, the way the language works, it includes mothers as well.
[2371.14 --> 2373.88]  You know, and it's not like mothers can exasperate their children.
[2375.04 --> 2378.60]  But the fathers do need to hear this.
[2378.78 --> 2382.50]  And I've noticed, I don't know if you've noticed the same, but in many cultures,
[2383.26 --> 2388.50]  sometimes dad gets the idea that taking care of the kids is just the mom's job.
[2388.50 --> 2395.78]  So Jim Gaffigan is a stand-up comedian, and he has some great lines about parenting.
[2396.64 --> 2397.70]  So he says this,
[2398.52 --> 2400.78]  Parenting is hard.
[2401.60 --> 2403.94]  My daughter's four, my son's two.
[2404.04 --> 2408.02]  I tell you, it is exhausting watching my wife do all the work.
[2409.30 --> 2410.66]  She should get some help.
[2411.24 --> 2413.64]  I can barely nap through all the screaming.
[2413.64 --> 2414.74]  Right?
[2415.74 --> 2419.92]  And so this is so funny because it's such a classic pattern that can happen.
[2420.66 --> 2421.74]  But it's not biblical.
[2422.44 --> 2422.58]  Right?
[2422.72 --> 2426.88]  Biblically speaking, it's on your shoulders, dad, to raise your children.
[2427.54 --> 2428.90]  Of course, mom is there too.
[2429.00 --> 2429.84]  She's going to be involved.
[2429.96 --> 2431.42]  But it is also your duty.
[2432.92 --> 2435.34]  So Paul here gives some instructions to mom and dad.
[2435.78 --> 2437.82]  He first tells them something not to do.
[2438.04 --> 2440.62]  And then he gives them something that they should do.
[2440.62 --> 2445.12]  First, he says, fathers, do not exasperate your children.
[2445.98 --> 2447.06]  This is very important.
[2448.18 --> 2453.22]  C.S. Lewis says, children have an incredibly strong sense of justice.
[2454.02 --> 2454.52]  Right?
[2454.58 --> 2458.98]  They can handle pretty much anything except being unfair.
[2459.84 --> 2464.58]  They know it very annoyingly when you're being unfair.
[2464.58 --> 2469.66]  If you're holding them to a rule that you don't hold yourself to.
[2470.26 --> 2473.04]  Or if you're maybe playing favorites among your children.
[2473.80 --> 2475.48]  Or if you're just being arbitrary.
[2476.22 --> 2476.92]  They can tell.
[2478.44 --> 2482.34]  So we should be careful not to exasperate our children.
[2482.96 --> 2485.14]  Now, of course, that doesn't mean we let them do whatever they want.
[2485.36 --> 2490.88]  It's unavoidable that as we limit their desires, that a child would get angry briefly.
[2490.88 --> 2497.18]  But Paul is telling us not to control them in such a way that it builds long-term bitterness.
[2498.76 --> 2501.10]  And so we should never parent our children out of anger.
[2501.84 --> 2503.94]  We shouldn't insult them or put them down.
[2504.86 --> 2505.70]  Don't be unfair.
[2506.38 --> 2509.10]  Don't crush their spirits, but rather raise them up.
[2509.52 --> 2510.16]  Encourage them.
[2510.40 --> 2511.70]  Compliment them when they do well.
[2512.58 --> 2516.84]  Say to them these very powerful words that God says about his own son.
[2516.84 --> 2520.98]  You are my son whom I love.
[2521.68 --> 2523.40]  With you I am well pleased.
[2524.60 --> 2526.74]  That is very important in raising children.
[2528.16 --> 2530.66]  Now, let's look again at verse 4.
[2531.28 --> 2533.34]  There are two words here that Paul uses.
[2534.28 --> 2539.62]  Bring them up in the training and the instruction of the Lord.
[2540.70 --> 2545.56]  Older translations, like the King James Version, uses the words nurture and admonition.
[2545.56 --> 2546.82]  Maybe you are familiar with that.
[2547.42 --> 2550.68]  Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[2551.24 --> 2554.74]  These are two very key words that have slightly different meanings.
[2555.82 --> 2560.94]  The first word, training or nurture, is the Greek word paideia.
[2561.64 --> 2567.94]  And you might encounter this word if you work in education because this is the word from which we get our English word pedagogy.
[2568.90 --> 2570.82]  It is the education of children.
[2570.82 --> 2575.96]  And paideia involves the training of the mind, teaching them knowledge.
[2576.60 --> 2581.38]  But in the ancient world, it also included formation of character.
[2581.58 --> 2586.68]  It included really much the formation of the soul and the training in virtue.
[2587.56 --> 2593.96]  In the ancient world, they didn't separate religious life from what we kind of now consider secular or ordinary life.
[2594.08 --> 2595.70]  They were actually just all together.
[2595.84 --> 2596.46]  Life is life.
[2596.46 --> 2605.80]  And so in the ancient world, a teacher was almost just as much a religious leader as anything else, training the child to grow up in virtue.
[2607.08 --> 2614.38]  And to be a student was to be in a close relationship with a teacher where you were a disciple.
[2614.38 --> 2620.82]  You know, in the movie, The Karate Kid, there's this young guy, Daniel.
[2622.24 --> 2623.76]  He wants to learn karate.
[2624.18 --> 2627.70]  And so he goes to the sensei, the old master named Mr. Miyagi.
[2628.28 --> 2630.12]  And he says, you know, please teach me karate.
[2630.38 --> 2634.84]  And the pattern is, they say, no, no, no, no time.
[2636.20 --> 2637.64]  But the student has to persist.
[2637.86 --> 2639.48]  They say, no, I really want to learn.
[2640.12 --> 2641.06]  And so that's the first step.
[2641.16 --> 2643.66]  Finally, okay, they get an audience with the master.
[2643.66 --> 2651.22]  The second thing that the master does is try to make life hard for the student.
[2651.56 --> 2652.78]  Just treat them horribly.
[2653.28 --> 2655.94]  He gives them hard things to do to see if they'll run away.
[2656.78 --> 2659.12]  See if they'll, you know, if they can't handle it.
[2660.38 --> 2666.12]  And finally, if the student makes it through that, the disciple then enters into the relationship.
[2666.12 --> 2673.42]  And over time, he's not learning only the information or the skills, but he's becoming like the teacher.
[2674.48 --> 2677.72]  This is what education in the ancient world was all about.
[2677.96 --> 2682.74]  In the Greco-Roman world and in the Jewish world, when you were a disciple of a master,
[2683.24 --> 2690.62]  you were really seeking to learn not only what the master knows, but to become who the master is.
[2690.62 --> 2699.66]  And Paul here is saying, we need to have the paideia, the training of the Lord.
[2700.44 --> 2705.48]  We are enrolling our children in the school of Christ.
[2706.36 --> 2712.22]  He is our master and we are in the process of becoming like him.
[2712.22 --> 2717.10]  And parents, you are the ones who must enroll your children into the school.
[2717.74 --> 2722.48]  You must bring your children up in the training of the Lord.
[2723.84 --> 2725.78]  And remember what it says in Deuteronomy.
[2727.10 --> 2731.56]  It says, these commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts.
[2732.50 --> 2735.00]  Impress them on your children.
[2736.02 --> 2737.30]  And when are we to do this?
[2737.38 --> 2737.80]  Impressing.
[2737.80 --> 2743.18]  He says, talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road.
[2743.56 --> 2746.72]  When you lie down and when you get up.
[2748.04 --> 2755.24]  So parents are always, at all times, at all places, to be training their kids in Jesus.
[2756.48 --> 2759.92]  And so when you wake up in the morning, the school bell has rung.
[2760.68 --> 2762.18]  You are the sensei.
[2762.24 --> 2763.02]  You are the master.
[2763.02 --> 2767.76]  And you want your children to be the disciples who are growing up in the way of Jesus.
[2768.76 --> 2769.80]  To know Jesus.
[2770.14 --> 2770.86]  To follow him.
[2772.54 --> 2776.00]  And so the first word is this training or nurture.
[2777.24 --> 2782.10]  Then the second word that Paul uses is instruction or admonition.
[2782.88 --> 2785.44]  And this is a little bit more on the negative side of things.
[2785.60 --> 2788.54]  Literally, it means correction or rebuke.
[2788.54 --> 2792.00]  So you're going to be raising them up in this training.
[2792.38 --> 2795.76]  But there's also times of correction.
[2796.52 --> 2798.62]  Now, why do we sometimes need correction?
[2799.42 --> 2803.72]  Well, it's because every single human being is born with a sinful nature.
[2803.72 --> 2811.44]  As a kid, I remember my own pastor always talking about, you know, baptizing a child and say, this cute little bundle of sin.
[2812.90 --> 2818.50]  And, you know, we're like, oh, it's kind of, you know, I don't know, like mean or.
[2818.50 --> 2821.86]  But it's getting to a theological truth.
[2822.06 --> 2826.58]  That while they are very cute, they are sinners.
[2826.88 --> 2828.30]  Just like every one of us.
[2828.60 --> 2829.82]  Kids are sinners right away.
[2829.90 --> 2831.24]  You don't have to teach them how to sin.
[2832.04 --> 2834.30]  Children are selfish at a very early age.
[2834.82 --> 2836.64]  They lie from a very early age.
[2837.26 --> 2841.14]  And when they're crying and screaming, if they were strong enough, they would harm you.
[2841.96 --> 2842.82]  Luckily, they're small.
[2842.82 --> 2846.24]  So they have to be corrected.
[2847.38 --> 2854.46]  And this means that when they do something wrong, you have to explain what they did, what the sin was, why it was wrong.
[2854.88 --> 2859.54]  And you use correction for the purpose of discouraging them from doing it again.
[2861.46 --> 2867.42]  And then, and this is important, the parent must restore the child to fellowship with the parent.
[2868.36 --> 2872.52]  The child hopefully understands what they did wrong.
[2872.82 --> 2878.10]  They experience or express regret or repentance, I mean.
[2879.26 --> 2882.48]  The parent then gives forgiveness and grace.
[2883.16 --> 2885.24]  And you are back together in love and harmony.
[2886.60 --> 2891.58]  And it's also important that you model to children what this looks like yourself.
[2892.22 --> 2892.40]  Right?
[2892.46 --> 2894.98]  That you also are a sinner.
[2895.98 --> 2897.32]  You also make mistakes.
[2897.32 --> 2902.72]  And that as a parent, you also are under the authority of your heavenly father.
[2903.64 --> 2903.76]  Right?
[2903.82 --> 2908.86]  There will be times in your life of raising kids when you must repent to your children.
[2909.70 --> 2912.88]  When you have failed to do what you should have done.
[2913.58 --> 2916.26]  Or when you did something that you should not have done.
[2917.04 --> 2919.18]  You know, maybe you did or said something wrong.
[2919.52 --> 2920.38]  You lost your temper.
[2920.38 --> 2926.64]  Whatever it is, don't pretend that you are perfect or that you are above repenting.
[2927.26 --> 2931.32]  If you've sinned against your children, you should ask your children to forgive you.
[2931.32 --> 2933.58]  And I want you to know it is not too late.
[2934.18 --> 2938.88]  That's something that all of us can do, even years later maybe.
[2938.88 --> 2942.84]  And this is a key to not exasperating them.
[2943.70 --> 2945.10]  As Paul said earlier, right?
[2945.12 --> 2949.08]  The child has to know that repentance and forgiveness is real.
[2949.74 --> 2951.26]  It counts for everybody.
[2951.26 --> 2959.78]  And they see you modeling it in that you are doing what you are requiring them to do.
[2960.74 --> 2965.18]  And so training and instruction, nurture and admonition, these are two parts of raising children.
[2965.18 --> 2968.28]  And I think it comes together like this.
[2968.40 --> 2970.40]  Dan Allender is a Christian counselor.
[2970.82 --> 2972.20]  And he's written a lot about parenting.
[2972.86 --> 2976.60]  He says basically, you don't have to read all the parenting books.
[2977.32 --> 2980.46]  That basically there are two questions every child asks.
[2981.14 --> 2984.78]  That parenting really boils down to these two questions.
[2985.68 --> 2990.36]  The first question is that children ask, do you love me?
[2990.36 --> 2996.16]  And children need to consistently sense that the answer to this question is yes.
[2996.62 --> 2999.30]  Even in the middle of correction and discipline.
[2999.88 --> 3001.04]  Do you love me?
[3001.48 --> 3001.96]  Yes.
[3003.08 --> 3007.06]  The second question is, can I have whatever I want?
[3008.54 --> 3013.58]  And they need to sense on a consistent basis that the answer to this question is no.
[3014.52 --> 3017.18]  No, you can't have whatever you want.
[3017.18 --> 3023.42]  And so if they are sensing those two answers, yes, I love you, but no, you can't have whatever you want.
[3023.96 --> 3035.00]  If you're doing that on a consistent basis, you are very likely establishing a healthy pattern of training and admonition.
[3036.22 --> 3044.80]  And the whole goal of parenting is we teach our kids to believe in Jesus, to follow Jesus, to love Jesus.
[3044.80 --> 3047.92]  The results are in God's hands.
[3050.64 --> 3057.74]  But the process of teaching and leading our children in that direction is what parenting is all about.
[3058.64 --> 3069.24]  Or it's what all of our ministry as the body of Christ to our covenant children is all about.
[3069.36 --> 3073.48]  You have to remember when we baptize babies here, what do we say?
[3073.48 --> 3079.82]  We make vows that we will help these parents raise these children.
[3079.94 --> 3081.46]  It's not only on the parents.
[3082.12 --> 3084.96]  They are responsible, but so are we.
[3086.72 --> 3088.66]  And so this is a daunting task.
[3088.82 --> 3095.26]  You know, whether we are children called to obey our parents or we're older children, in a sense, called to honor our parents.
[3095.26 --> 3101.52]  Whether we are parents bringing up our children in the Lord, we can only do it by the grace of God.
[3102.22 --> 3104.72]  We can only do it with the help of the Holy Spirit.
[3105.64 --> 3107.42]  And as I said, we have to do it together.
[3108.30 --> 3113.76]  Because yes, you know, Paul's talking about parents and children, but it's parents and children in the Lord.
[3113.76 --> 3119.70]  And he's talking about families, but he's talking in the context of the family of God, the church.
[3120.68 --> 3125.22]  And we need other Christians in the church to help us in this process.
[3125.98 --> 3127.40]  To teach Sunday school.
[3127.98 --> 3131.54]  To give wisdom and help to young parents.
[3132.02 --> 3137.68]  To show one another how we can honor our parents, maybe in their elderly stage of life.
[3137.68 --> 3139.98]  All of these things, we need to support one another.
[3141.48 --> 3145.84]  And so let us be a community that encourages one another and helps one another in this process.
[3146.16 --> 3147.78]  And in doing this, we love one another.
[3148.86 --> 3150.82]  And let's do this for the glory of God.
[3151.68 --> 3159.26]  Right? Because of his love for us in Jesus Christ, we have become sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.
[3160.10 --> 3161.98]  He's a Father who loves us.
[3162.66 --> 3165.98]  A Father who trains and disciplines us.
[3165.98 --> 3169.44]  Because we are his true children.
[3170.54 --> 3176.04]  He is a Father who promises and is bringing us to completion.
[3176.74 --> 3179.50]  For our good and for his glory.
[3180.16 --> 3181.48]  So let's pray together.
[3183.46 --> 3185.90]  Father, we do now ask for your grace.
[3187.18 --> 3191.20]  Be, Lord, with our children from the earliest of days.
[3191.96 --> 3193.16]  Draw them to yourself.
[3193.56 --> 3194.58]  Train them up.
[3194.58 --> 3197.16]  In knowing you and following you.
[3197.86 --> 3200.08]  Give them soft hearts that want to obey.
[3201.32 --> 3204.26]  And who most of all, Lord, want to walk with you.
[3205.26 --> 3206.84]  And we pray for parents.
[3207.12 --> 3209.30]  We pray for grandparents.
[3209.62 --> 3212.12]  For all of us, even, in this family of God.
[3212.20 --> 3214.84]  Who care for our covenant children.
[3214.84 --> 3218.48]  That you would help us to love our children.
[3218.48 --> 3222.86]  And that we would raise them up in nurture, in admonition.
[3223.46 --> 3227.94]  That all of this would be done in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3228.94 --> 3231.50]  And Lord, we thank you that you will never leave us.
[3232.00 --> 3234.48]  But that one day you will raise us up.
[3234.48 --> 3236.70]  On the day of Jesus Christ.
[3237.50 --> 3242.04]  That you who began a good work in us will be faithful to see it through to the end.
[3242.54 --> 3244.16]  And we pray in Jesus' name.
[3245.04 --> 3245.34]  Amen.
[3245.34 --> 3247.68]  So please rise.
[3247.76 --> 3252.40]  We're going to sing a song connected to this theme of households.
[3252.54 --> 3254.56]  It's called In Our Households.
[3254.56 --> 3255.36]  It's a new one to me.
[3255.82 --> 3256.86]  I'm not sure if you all know it.
[3256.92 --> 3258.20]  But let's learn it together.
[3258.20 --> 3278.88]  In Our Households
[3278.88 --> 3281.48]  Heavenly Father
[3281.48 --> 3286.26]  Bless the bonds that
[3286.26 --> 3289.78]  Make us one
[3289.78 --> 3293.58]  May our love spring
[3293.58 --> 3296.60]  Collect your loving
[3296.60 --> 3301.48]  May your will be
[3301.48 --> 3305.00]  Always done
[3305.00 --> 3308.30]  Send your spirit
[3308.30 --> 3313.36]  To inspire us
[3313.36 --> 3318.88]  And to teach your discipline
[3318.88 --> 3324.68]  May our actions
[3324.68 --> 3327.32]  Our conversations
[3327.32 --> 3332.34]  Show your peace and
[3332.34 --> 3334.68]  Joy within
[3334.68 --> 3337.98]  And in
[3337.98 --> 3338.14]  In
[3338.14 --> 3341.10]  Like
[3341.10 --> 3341.24]  Life
[3341.24 --> 3342.52]  For Mary
[3342.52 --> 3345.58]  Make us
[3345.58 --> 3346.86]  Open
[3346.86 --> 3348.60]  Make us
[3348.60 --> 3348.76]  Keep your
[3348.76 --> 3350.08]  Call
[3350.08 --> 3350.20]  2
[3350.20 --> 3354.20]  A
[3354.20 --> 3366.70]  Come for others and show love to one and all.
[3366.70 --> 3374.20]  Help us make the hopes a haven.
[3375.62 --> 3380.46]  Wake with hospitality.
[3380.46 --> 3396.18]  Move us more to serve each other with true love and charity.
[3401.36 --> 3402.82]  You may be seated.
[3403.92 --> 3407.94]  Our offering this morning is for Water Life Canada.
[3407.94 --> 3415.18]  And you can see what they do on the screen equipping people in Africa and Haiti so that they can
[3415.18 --> 3416.94]  drill wells and build washrooms.
[3416.94 --> 3423.94]  Thank you.
[3423.94 --> 3430.94]  Thank you.
[3430.94 --> 3437.94]  Thank you.
[3437.94 --> 3444.94]  Thank you.
[3444.94 --> 3445.94]  Thank you.
[3445.94 --> 3447.94]  Thank you.
[3447.94 --> 3451.94]  Thank you.
[3451.94 --> 3452.94]  Thank you.
[3452.94 --> 3454.94]  Thank you.
[3454.94 --> 3458.94]  Thank you.
[3458.94 --> 3459.94]  Thank you.
[3459.94 --> 3461.94]  Thank you.
[3461.94 --> 3463.94]  Thank you.
[3463.94 --> 3465.94]  Thank you.
[3465.94 --> 3468.94]  Thank you.
[3468.94 --> 3472.94]  Thank you.
[3472.94 --> 3474.94]  Thank you.
[3474.94 --> 3476.94]  Thank you.
[3476.94 --> 3478.94]  Amen.
[3506.94 --> 3508.94]  Amen.
[3536.94 --> 3538.94]  Amen.
[3538.94 --> 3544.94]  We have the privilege to come together in prayer.
[3544.94 --> 3548.94]  United, asking God for many things this morning.
[3548.94 --> 3552.94]  There's a few updates
[3552.94 --> 3560.94]  that are updated from what's already in our bulletin.
[3560.94 --> 3564.94]  Fa'u is awaiting further surgery but needs to become stronger
[3564.94 --> 3566.94]  before she can have that surgery.
[3566.94 --> 3568.94]  So we'll pray for that.
[3568.94 --> 3572.94]  Lena's brother John is very thankful to be at home
[3572.94 --> 3574.94]  after six weeks in the hospital
[3574.94 --> 3578.94]  and also awaits further procedures.
[3578.94 --> 3582.94]  That won't be determined until his infection has cleared.
[3582.94 --> 3586.94]  Today is also designated a prayer,
[3586.94 --> 3590.94]  a day of prayer for the Iranian people.
[3590.94 --> 3592.94]  So let's remember that as well.
[3592.94 --> 3598.94]  And this morning I received a text from Bev Banstra.
[3598.94 --> 3602.94]  Bev and John arrived in Scotland on Friday
[3602.94 --> 3604.94]  and Bev had a fall yesterday
[3604.94 --> 3610.94]  and broke her right arm, right at the shoulder.
[3610.94 --> 3614.94]  Spent many hours in the hospital.
[3614.94 --> 3616.94]  And a lot of pain.
[3616.94 --> 3618.94]  So hopefully they can still continue.
[3618.94 --> 3620.94]  I think that's their plan.
[3620.94 --> 3626.94]  So we will pray for Bev as well and John as he supports her.
[3626.94 --> 3632.94]  I also received a note that we will pray for a young gal named Grace,
[3632.94 --> 3638.94]  who is the granddaughter of a woman that's been attending here, Pat.
[3638.94 --> 3642.94]  And her mother Sherry is also here this morning.
[3642.94 --> 3646.94]  And we just want to pray for Grace, who has significant health issues at this time.
[3646.94 --> 3648.94]  So many things to pray for.
[3648.94 --> 3650.94]  Let's do that together.
[3650.94 --> 3656.94]  God of justice and mercy, infinite love and grace,
[3656.94 --> 3658.94]  absolute power and wisdom,
[3658.94 --> 3660.94]  we give you highest honor and praise,
[3660.94 --> 3664.94]  for you are the only one worthy to receive it.
[3664.94 --> 3670.94]  Our worship of you is imperfect, yet may you delight in it,
[3670.94 --> 3674.94]  as adults delight in the love and wonder of children.
[3674.94 --> 3678.94]  Accept our love, whether it's expressed in quiet, thoughtful ways,
[3678.94 --> 3680.94]  or in loud exuberance.
[3680.94 --> 3685.94]  Sometimes we feel that love deeply, but sometimes it eludes us
[3685.94 --> 3688.94]  and we are filled more with doubts than trust and love.
[3688.94 --> 3692.94]  But over and over again in Scripture and in our own lives,
[3692.94 --> 3694.94]  you have proved faithful.
[3694.94 --> 3698.94]  So we bring to you our deepest needs once again.
[3698.94 --> 3701.94]  We pray for your church all over the world.
[3701.94 --> 3706.94]  We thank you for its growth in countries where there is persecution,
[3706.94 --> 3710.94]  even in places like Iran and India and so many other places
[3710.94 --> 3715.94]  where governments do their best to crush the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[3715.94 --> 3719.94]  We pray especially today for the people of Iran
[3719.94 --> 3724.94]  who are living under a very oppressive government.
[3724.94 --> 3727.94]  May the demonstrations that are taking place all over the world
[3727.94 --> 3729.94]  serve to make a change there.
[3729.94 --> 3733.94]  Give your church strength and courage.
[3733.94 --> 3736.94]  We pray for your people in areas that are war torn,
[3736.94 --> 3739.94]  especially in Ukraine and in Russia,
[3739.94 --> 3741.94]  where the turmoil and losses are so great.
[3741.94 --> 3747.94]  Even in times such as these, may your word and presence be strong among the weak.
[3747.94 --> 3751.94]  All over the world, may your grace replace the thirst for power.
[3751.94 --> 3755.94]  In these places, may the influence of the church, your bride,
[3755.94 --> 3761.94]  be powerful to usher in peace, to replace violence, and love to replace hatred.
[3761.94 --> 3767.94]  We thank you today for the privilege to invest in the work of Life Water Canada.
[3767.94 --> 3770.94]  Water does indeed nourish and cleanse.
[3770.94 --> 3775.94]  Will you use the gifts we have given to improve lives in far-off communities,
[3775.94 --> 3780.94]  also extending their enjoyment of the life-giving water that Christ offers?
[3780.94 --> 3784.94]  Thank you for our local classes that took place this week
[3784.94 --> 3787.94]  and for the good spirit present there.
[3787.94 --> 3793.94]  We thank you for this church, for the babies and the children in a largely aging congregation,
[3793.94 --> 3795.94]  and for our growing Chinese ministry.
[3795.94 --> 3799.94]  We pray for the work of both Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy.
[3799.94 --> 3803.94]  Will you give both what they stand in need of to do their work well?
[3803.94 --> 3807.94]  May we uphold them regularly in prayer and encouragement.
[3807.94 --> 3811.94]  We thank you, too, for all the years that Hans has spent with us
[3811.94 --> 3815.94]  and has been so involved here serving in various ways.
[3815.94 --> 3821.94]  May he have a smooth transition to Elam, finding his place there and quickly feeling at home.
[3821.94 --> 3825.94]  We bring before you those of us who are ill,
[3825.94 --> 3832.94]  especially Pat, who in addition to kidney issues, now also has been diagnosed with cancer.
[3832.94 --> 3838.94]  Be near to Fau and John who are awaiting further procedures.
[3838.94 --> 3845.94]  Give them strength and healing, but above all, a deep sense of your presence.
[3845.94 --> 3853.94]  We pray for Bev in Scotland that you will give her comfort from pain, speedy healing,
[3853.94 --> 3857.94]  and that they may still be able to enjoy their trip.
[3857.94 --> 3865.94]  Lord, we also pray for a young lady named Grace who is experiencing significant health issues.
[3865.94 --> 3870.94]  Lord, will you let her know that this, too, can be overcome?
[3870.94 --> 3874.94]  Will you be near her and those who love her and support her?
[3874.94 --> 3881.94]  Others among us struggle not only with physical but mental, emotional, and spiritual health.
[3881.94 --> 3885.94]  Sometimes we are paralyzed by fear and shut ourselves away.
[3885.94 --> 3890.94]  You know each one's hurts, whether or not they feel free to share their journey with others.
[3890.94 --> 3900.94]  May we walk together in love, caring for each other, being Christ's eyes, ears, hands, and feet to one another.
[3900.94 --> 3907.94]  Lord, we pray for strong families, for healthy relationships between spouses and between parents and children.
[3907.94 --> 3913.94]  May marriage partners seek to appreciate one another's differences in mutual love and submission,
[3913.94 --> 3918.94]  with eyes open to the unique way you have created each of us.
[3918.94 --> 3923.94]  Help parents to encourage their children according to the gifts you have given each one.
[3923.94 --> 3929.94]  Give patience and self-discipline to parents who struggle to guide and direct their children in loving ways.

[3963.94 --> 3972.94]  Lord, there are so many needs we pray for, yet we know that nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of God in Christ,
[3972.94 --> 3976.94]  or remove us from the presence of your Spirit.
[3976.94 --> 3983.94]  Show us what is most important as we walk this earth and help us pay attention to it.
[3983.94 --> 3991.94]  May we be marinated in your word, standing on the promises you make, filled with the knowledge of your faithfulness,
[3991.94 --> 3998.94]  for this alone will bring us the peace we so need, not only around us, but deep within.
[3998.94 --> 4004.94]  Keep us in the coming week as we leave today, immersed in your gracious care.

[4026.94 --> 4033.94]  Take this opportunity to talk with someone you may not know as well, especially if you see someone you don't know.
[4033.94 --> 4036.94]  Greet them. Welcome them.
[4036.94 --> 4042.94]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4042.94 --> 4047.94]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine,
[4047.94 --> 4051.94]  according to his power that is at work within us.
[4051.94 --> 4061.94]  To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
[4061.94 --> 4064.94]  Please remain standing and we'll sing our final song.
[4064.94 --> 4065.94]  The final song.
