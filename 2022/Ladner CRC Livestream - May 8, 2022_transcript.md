[269.92 --> 271.92]  Amen.
[271.92 --> 273.92]  Well, good morning.
[273.92 --> 274.92]  Good morning.
[274.92 --> 277.92]  And welcome, everyone, to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[277.92 --> 284.92]  A special welcome if you're visiting with us this morning, and certainly blessed by your presence among us, and thank you for joining us.
[284.92 --> 286.92]  My name is Jake Cron.
[286.92 --> 288.92]  I will be leading our service today.
[288.92 --> 304.92]  And with Pastor Jason enjoying, we hope and trust, his discovery journey in the Middle East, we also welcome Pastor Bill Tuninga to our church, and he'll be leading us to explore God's message and explore and celebrate communion with us today.
[304.92 --> 310.92]  Another announcement over on my right, your left, Owen Rusticus.
[310.92 --> 314.92]  We're happy to say has now transferred his membership to our church.
[314.92 --> 320.92]  She's been helping us with trumpet for a while now, and we're always grateful for that, and now we can formally welcome.
[320.92 --> 322.92]  So welcome, Owen.
[322.92 --> 324.92]  Thank you.
[324.92 --> 345.92]  And I certainly do hope all of us un-mothers do remember that today is Mother's Day, and it's a worthwhile point in our year to take pause and acknowledge our mothers, past and present, near or far, and reflect on all they mean and do for us.
[345.92 --> 355.92]  God greets us this morning, and calls us to worship him with these words from Psalm 139.
[355.92 --> 371.92]  We gather together to worship our loving, nurturing God, who, like a mother, knows us intimately, loves us unconditionally, teaches us the way we should go, and comforts us in need.
[371.92 --> 375.92]  Praise God, the source and sustainer of life.
[375.92 --> 385.92]  Now that God has greeted us, let's stand up, take a moment, and greet each other, after which the praise team will lead us in three songs.
[385.92 --> 387.92]  Thank you.
[415.92 --> 417.92]  Thank you.
[417.92 --> 418.92]  Thank you.
[418.92 --> 424.92]  Thank you.
[424.92 --> 435.92]  Thank you.
[435.92 --> 445.92]  Joyful joy from the way of Dorothy, God of glory, Lord of love.
[445.92 --> 455.02]  Farms of fun and flowers before them, opening to the sun above.
[455.62 --> 464.40]  Melchom the clouds of sin and sadness, bright and dark of doubt of pain.
[464.40 --> 474.60]  Give her a big heart of my eyes, fill us with the light of day.
[477.18 --> 486.76]  All our words rejoice around, earth and heavenly flag our names.
[486.76 --> 496.76]  Stars and angels sing around, center of unbroken place.
[497.28 --> 505.76]  Field and forest, river and mountain, flowering and all flashing steam.
[505.76 --> 516.76]  Chanting, earth and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee.
[516.76 --> 523.76]  Chanting, earth and mountain, flowering and all shining.
[523.76 --> 528.76]  Chanting, earth and shining, star of the sun above.
[528.76 --> 533.76]  Chanting, earth and shining, star of the sun above.
[533.76 --> 540.76]  Chanting, earth and shining, star of the sun above.
[540.76 --> 551.46]  Chanting, earth and shining, star of the sun above.
[551.46 --> 560.60]  Angels, and to love we die, lift us to the joy divine.
[581.46 --> 584.46]  Amen.
[611.46 --> 613.46]  Amen.
[641.46 --> 643.46]  Amen.

[881.46 --> 883.46]  Amen.
[911.46 --> 913.46]  Amen.
[941.46 --> 943.46]  Amen.
[971.46 --> 973.46]  Amen.
[990.52 --> 994.12]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[994.12 --> 1011.26]  Eternal God, on this special day of remembering and honoring mothers, we are reminded anew of the great things you have done through our mothers, who labored long to order our steps in your way, truth, and life.
[1011.68 --> 1022.96]  For this we give you thanks, even as we confess that we have not done our best in all seasons of life to build upon the foundation of faith so graciously transmitted to us.
[1023.92 --> 1028.04]  Forgive us for lagging in zeal and resting in one place too long.
[1029.12 --> 1037.66]  Send forth your spirit that we may reclaim the faith of our mothers and get on with working the works that you have given to our hands.
[1039.10 --> 1043.26]  All this we pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1045.64 --> 1051.48]  Our hearts can rejoice today, for we believe and know that God is merciful and just
[1051.48 --> 1053.48]  and forgives us our sins.
[1054.14 --> 1055.84]  In Jesus Christ, we are forgiven.
[1056.44 --> 1057.30]  Glory to God.
[1058.72 --> 1061.40]  Let's sing that miracle with And Can It Be.
[1061.40 --> 1062.52]  Amen.
[1062.52 --> 1063.52]  Amen.
[1066.46 --> 1068.56]  Amen.
[1068.56 --> 1068.78]  Amen.
[1072.48 --> 1072.62]  Amen.
[1072.62 --> 1074.30]  Amen.
[1074.60 --> 1082.14]  Amen.
[1082.14 --> 1083.14]  Amen.
[1112.14 --> 1113.14]  Amen.
[1142.14 --> 1144.14]  Amen.
[1172.14 --> 1174.14]  Amen.
[1202.14 --> 1203.14]  Amen.
[1232.14 --> 1234.14]  Amen.
[1262.14 --> 1264.14]  Amen.
[1292.14 --> 1293.14]  Amen.
[1322.14 --> 1323.14]  Amen.
[1323.14 --> 1324.14]  Amen.
[1324.14 --> 1325.14]  Amen.
[1325.14 --> 1326.14]  Amen.
[1326.14 --> 1327.14]  Amen.
[1327.14 --> 1328.14]  Amen.
[1328.14 --> 1329.14]  Amen.
[1329.14 --> 1330.14]  Amen.
[1330.14 --> 1331.14]  Amen.
[1331.14 --> 1332.14]  Amen.
[1332.14 --> 1341.14]  Well, it's good to be with you this morning, not only to worship, thank you for leading
[1341.14 --> 1351.14]  us in that, but also to do something that's actually incredibly personal.
[1351.14 --> 1360.14]  Share this meal together, this Lord's Supper, as we've called it, Holy Communion.
[1360.14 --> 1368.14]  I'd like to invite you to it through the words of what will actually be our text a little
[1368.14 --> 1370.14]  later in the service.
[1370.14 --> 1379.14]  Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened.
[1379.14 --> 1386.14]  And I will give you rest.
[1386.14 --> 1396.14]  To all who are wearied with the concerns of life, what's happening in our world, burdened
[1396.14 --> 1413.14]  perhaps by your own personal failures, lost opportunities, or perhaps a sin you've committed that weighs heavy on your heart.
[1413.14 --> 1425.14]  And that's why, to all of us, Jesus, the host, is now inviting us to come to him.
[1425.14 --> 1440.14]  In the bread and in the juice to receive him, to receive his rest, his grace, and his love.
[1440.14 --> 1461.14]  Our Lord, who, as our passage will point out, is humble and gentle in heart, promises rest for all the souls of those who come to him to eat and to drink of him.
[1461.14 --> 1468.14]  You're not commanded to come.
[1468.14 --> 1473.14]  It's an offer freely given from Christ.
[1473.14 --> 1478.14]  You know, sometimes when we have supper at home, it's a little bit mandatory.
[1478.14 --> 1483.14]  It is supper time and you come and we sit there and we eat.
[1483.14 --> 1484.14]  No.
[1484.14 --> 1491.14]  Jesus in no way force feeds his followers.
[1491.14 --> 1496.14]  It's the generous offer of his grace.
[1496.14 --> 1511.14]  It's his body which is in the bread and it's his shed blood in the drink, freely given to cover for our sin.
[1511.14 --> 1532.14]  And your participation as you sit in the pew and take the bread and drink the cup is your way of responding already to his call as you come to him and find rest for your souls.
[1532.14 --> 1534.14]  Would you pray with me?
[1534.14 --> 1543.14]  Thank you, Father, for the blessing of your grace and the gift of your son, Jesus.
[1543.14 --> 1555.14]  Thank you, Lord Jesus, for becoming like us, dying our death, and sharing your resurrection victory with us.
[1555.14 --> 1567.14]  Thank you, Holy Spirit, for the healing gospel for your worldwide church and the hope of eternal life.
[1567.14 --> 1575.14]  Father, as we now eat this bread and share in the cup, will you deepen our connection with your son, Jesus?
[1575.14 --> 1586.14]  And will you also more deeply unify and sanctify us together by your spirit?
[1586.14 --> 1589.14]  In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1589.14 --> 1599.14]  I'd like to invite those who are serving to come and join me around this table.
[1599.14 --> 1624.42]  I see there is
[1624.42 --> 1626.58]  I ask partly for my wife
[1626.58 --> 1627.98]  there's gluten free bread here
[1627.98 --> 1629.72]  wrapped in a little package
[1629.72 --> 1632.04]  we didn't take some along
[1632.04 --> 1637.86]  yes there's some on every tray
[1637.86 --> 1639.28]  I kind of figured as much
[1639.28 --> 1640.34]  I saw the top one
[1640.34 --> 1641.08]  but thank you
[1641.08 --> 1643.78]  the logistics of a meal
[1643.78 --> 1647.02]  the Lord Jesus
[1647.02 --> 1650.02]  think of it
[1650.02 --> 1652.08]  on the night he was betrayed
[1652.08 --> 1656.18]  took the bread
[1656.18 --> 1659.62]  and when he had given thanks
[1659.62 --> 1661.56]  he broke it
[1661.56 --> 1664.04]  and he said
[1664.04 --> 1666.98]  this is my body
[1666.98 --> 1670.06]  given for you
[1670.06 --> 1671.76]  do this
[1671.76 --> 1672.70]  eat of it
[1672.70 --> 1674.50]  in remembrance
[1674.50 --> 1675.92]  of me
[1675.92 --> 1678.90]  we will now pass out
[1678.90 --> 1679.70]  the bread
[1679.70 --> 1681.56]  and then we will eat it together
[1681.56 --> 1683.62]  and then later we will share
[1683.62 --> 1687.84]  in the blood of Christ
[1687.84 --> 1693.24]  with you
[1693.24 --> 1695.22]  let your aid
[1695.22 --> 1696.00]  things in a moment
[1696.00 --> 1697.58]  through the breakfast
[1697.58 --> 1699.54]  and then we will now yes
[1699.54 --> 1700.30]  you
[1700.30 --> 1701.04]  place WILL
[1701.04 --> 1702.40]  and then you
[1702.40 --> 1703.16]  like aятель
[1703.16 --> 1704.00]  прид in to come up
[1704.00 --> 1704.32]  whatever you life
[1704.32 --> 1705.56]  for you
[1706.08 --> 1706.60]  we will see you
[1706.60 --> 1706.86]  in the water
[1706.86 --> 1707.86]  Amen.
[1736.86 --> 1737.86]  Amen.
[1766.86 --> 1767.86]  Amen.
[1796.86 --> 1797.86]  Amen.
[1826.86 --> 1827.86]  Amen.
[1856.86 --> 1857.86]  Amen.
[1857.86 --> 1858.86]  Amen.
[1858.86 --> 1859.86]  Amen.
[1859.86 --> 1860.86]  Amen.
[1860.86 --> 1861.86]  Amen.
[1861.86 --> 1862.86]  Amen.
[1862.86 --> 1863.86]  Amen.
[1863.86 --> 1876.20]  Having now taken, eat, remember and believe the body of Christ was given for the complete
[1876.20 --> 1880.10]  remission of all of your and my sin.
[1880.10 --> 1893.36]  Amen.
[1893.36 --> 1898.62]  Amen.
[1898.62 --> 1899.92]  Amen.
[1899.92 --> 1904.20]  Amen.

[1906.20 --> 1908.06]  Amen.
[1908.06 --> 1908.12]  Amen.
[1908.12 --> 1912.74]  just as Jesus
[1912.74 --> 1916.36]  on the night he was betrayed
[1916.36 --> 1919.00]  blessed the bread
[1919.00 --> 1921.48]  so too
[1921.48 --> 1925.90]  at the end of the meal he took the cup
[1925.90 --> 1930.64]  and he asked all of his disciples to drink from it
[1930.64 --> 1933.66]  and he said this is my blood of the covenant
[1933.66 --> 1935.64]  which is for you
[1935.64 --> 1937.38]  do this also
[1937.38 --> 1940.04]  in remembrance of me
[1940.04 --> 1942.08]  please now receive
[1942.08 --> 1943.58]  the blood of Christ
[1943.58 --> 1945.92]  in the form of this drink
[1945.92 --> 1954.92]  thank you
[1954.92 --> 1965.08]  thank you
[1967.38 --> 1972.08]  thank you

[2150.64 --> 2152.64]  Amen.
[2152.64 --> 2154.64]  Amen.
[2154.64 --> 2164.64]  Well, just as real as it is that you hold this cup and drink this juice, so real it is for what Christ has done for us.
[2164.64 --> 2175.64]  So drink and again remember and believe it that the blood of our Lord Jesus was shed for the complete remission of all of your and my sin.
[2183.64 --> 2186.64]  Would you please pray with me?
[2186.64 --> 2203.64]  Father in heaven, as we continue to digest the reality and the beauty and the nourishment of your grace in our lives,
[2203.64 --> 2210.64]  we pray that our hearts may continue to be grateful for all that you have done for us.
[2210.64 --> 2217.64]  Thank you for assuring us through this bread and drink of your grace.
[2217.64 --> 2227.64]  We continue now to increase our faith and deepen our hope and expand our love in Christ.
[2227.64 --> 2249.64]  So that in all the troubles and the sorrows of this life, we might persevere, praying in your spirit, eyes fixed on our Lord, standing firm and assured that we will be there when Christ returns for that great banquet meal.
[2249.64 --> 2252.64]  And it's in his name we pray.
[2252.64 --> 2254.64]  Amen.
[2254.64 --> 2255.64]  Thank you.
[2255.64 --> 2265.64]  I believe at this time we're going to have a children's message.
[2265.64 --> 2266.64]  Correct.
[2266.64 --> 2267.64]  Thank you.
[2267.64 --> 2281.64]  Good morning everyone.
[2281.64 --> 2282.64]  My name is Hannah Yao.
[2282.64 --> 2291.64]  I'm the children's ministry coordinator here.
[2291.64 --> 2295.64]  Pastor Jason is away on the study trip to Israel.
[2295.64 --> 2298.64]  So I'm doing the children's message for the children today.
[2298.64 --> 2301.64]  So now I invite all the children to come to the front.
[2301.64 --> 2310.64]  Please.
[2310.64 --> 2311.64]  Good morning.
[2311.64 --> 2312.64]  Thank you.
[2312.64 --> 2313.64]  Thank you.
[2313.64 --> 2314.64]  Thank you.
[2314.64 --> 2315.64]  Thank you.
[2315.64 --> 2316.64]  Thank you.
[2316.64 --> 2317.64]  Thank you.
[2317.64 --> 2318.64]  Thank you.
[2318.64 --> 2319.64]  Thank you.
[2323.64 --> 2324.64]  Thank you.
[2324.64 --> 2325.64]  You lost your sister?
[2327.64 --> 2328.64]  Why is Sylvia?
[2328.64 --> 2333.64]  Oh, she's outside.
[2333.64 --> 2335.64]  Okay, sit down.
[2335.64 --> 2340.64]  All right, boys and girls, how are you today?
[2340.64 --> 2343.64]  Do you know today is a special day?
[2343.64 --> 2347.64]  Yeah, what is it?
[2347.64 --> 2349.64]  Yeah, Mother's Day.
[2349.64 --> 2354.64]  Can we all say Happy Mother's Day to our moms really loud on the count of three?
[2354.64 --> 2357.64]  One, two, three.
[2357.64 --> 2360.64]  Happy Mother's Day!
[2360.64 --> 2369.64]  Okay, so since it's Mother's Day, I'm going to tell you a story from the Bible about a mom.
[2369.64 --> 2375.64]  So this story is from the book of 1 Samuel, chapter 1.
[2375.64 --> 2380.64]  I'm not going to read all the chapters to you.
[2380.64 --> 2381.64]  It's quite long.
[2381.64 --> 2387.64]  So I did some illustration on my computer, as you can see here.
[2387.64 --> 2393.64]  And I'll tell a brief version of 1 Samuel, chapter 1.
[2393.64 --> 2394.64]  Okay.
[2394.64 --> 2400.64]  Now, this mom, her name is Hannah.
[2400.64 --> 2402.64]  Yeah.
[2402.64 --> 2405.64]  Same name as mine, right?
[2405.64 --> 2409.64]  Yeah, I like Hannah so much.
[2409.64 --> 2412.64]  That's why I named myself after her.
[2412.64 --> 2416.64]  Now you know where my name is from.
[2416.64 --> 2417.64]  Okay.
[2417.64 --> 2420.64]  So the story is like this.
[2420.64 --> 2422.64]  So you can see, there's a picture here.
[2422.64 --> 2424.64]  This is Hannah.
[2424.64 --> 2433.64]  And Hannah is married to a man named Elkanah.
[2433.64 --> 2435.64]  Elkanah, yes.
[2435.64 --> 2440.64]  Elkanah also has another wife named Panina.
[2440.64 --> 2441.64]  Yeah.
[2441.64 --> 2445.64]  Do you figure out something similar to their names?
[2445.64 --> 2448.64]  Hannah, Elkanah, Panina.
[2448.64 --> 2451.64]  All ends with Na.
[2451.64 --> 2453.64]  Interesting, huh?
[2453.64 --> 2456.64]  So Hannah was sad.
[2456.64 --> 2457.64]  Look at the picture.
[2457.64 --> 2458.64]  She was so sad.
[2458.64 --> 2463.64]  Because she doesn't have any children.
[2463.64 --> 2465.64]  No children.
[2465.64 --> 2467.64]  She doesn't have any children.
[2467.64 --> 2469.64]  Yeah.
[2469.64 --> 2476.64]  Don't ruin my story.
[2476.64 --> 2483.64]  Panina also provoked her seriously to make her life really miserable.
[2483.64 --> 2485.64]  Because she doesn't have children.
[2485.64 --> 2488.64]  But her husband's other wife has children.
[2488.64 --> 2492.64]  So Panina provoked her all the time.
[2492.64 --> 2495.64]  So Hannah was really sad.
[2495.64 --> 2504.64]  Every year, Elkanah and Hannah would go to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.
[2504.64 --> 2506.64]  That's the name of the house of the Lord.
[2506.64 --> 2507.64]  Shiloh.
[2507.64 --> 2509.64]  Can we all say Shiloh?
[2509.64 --> 2510.64]  Shiloh.
[2510.64 --> 2511.64]  Yes.
[2511.64 --> 2516.64]  They prayed to God and to offer sacrifices there.
[2516.64 --> 2521.64]  So Hannah was so sad.
[2521.64 --> 2528.64]  Because she doesn't have any children and because she got provoked by Panina all the time.
[2528.64 --> 2531.64]  The other lady.
[2531.64 --> 2536.64]  So she didn't feel like eating anything at the temple feast.
[2536.64 --> 2540.64]  Instead, she went inside the temple to pray.
[2540.64 --> 2545.64]  When Hannah prayed, she cried out to the Lord.
[2545.64 --> 2554.64]  She told the Lord all about her sadness and how Panina provoked her and made her life miserable.
[2554.64 --> 2557.64]  Just because she doesn't have any children.
[2557.64 --> 2567.64]  She prayed and cried, praying her soul out to the Lord in the temple for a very, very long time.
[2567.64 --> 2570.64]  You can see all the tears in the picture, right?
[2570.64 --> 2576.64]  She was praying and crying, telling God everything about her life.
[2576.64 --> 2588.64]  And in her prayer, she also promised that if God gives her a son, she will offer him to the Lord.
[2588.64 --> 2589.64]  God.
[2589.64 --> 2596.64]  And he will serve God all the days of his life.
[2596.64 --> 2603.64]  So while Hannah was praying, the priest at that time, his name was Eli.
[2603.64 --> 2608.64]  He saw Hannah praying and crying.
[2608.64 --> 2619.64]  She saw that he saw that Hannah was drunk because Hannah was not praying out loud, but only praying, moving her lips.
[2619.64 --> 2627.64]  So he went over to talk to Hannah and tell her, you need to stop drinking.
[2627.64 --> 2631.64]  But Hannah said, no, I wasn't drunk.
[2631.64 --> 2636.64]  I was just praying, pouring my heart out to the Lord.
[2636.64 --> 2641.64]  So Eli said, oh, in that case, you can go in peace.
[2641.64 --> 2644.64]  May the Lord grant your prayer.
[2644.64 --> 2651.64]  So after that, Hannah felt much happier and she went home with her husband.
[2651.64 --> 2654.64]  And guess what?
[2654.64 --> 2656.64]  What happened?
[2656.64 --> 2658.64]  Yeah, she had a baby.
[2658.64 --> 2667.64]  Pretty soon she got pregnant and she had a baby and she named him Samuel.
[2667.64 --> 2674.64]  When Samuel was weaned from his mother's milk, Hannah took him to the temple.
[2674.64 --> 2683.64]  She gave Samuel to Eli so that Samuel could serve the Lord all the days of his life.
[2683.64 --> 2688.64]  And Samuel grew up in the temple, serving the Lord.
[2688.64 --> 2694.64]  And he became a great prophet in the Bible.
[2694.64 --> 2699.64]  And he wrote the book, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel.
[2699.64 --> 2704.64]  So boys and girls, that's a story that I want to tell you.
[2704.64 --> 2709.64]  But I want you to learn some important things from the story.
[2709.64 --> 2711.64]  Okay, number one.
[2711.64 --> 2721.64]  Hannah, did she do anything bad back to her rival, Penina?
[2721.64 --> 2724.64]  Did she pay evil with evil?
[2724.64 --> 2727.64]  No, she didn't, right?
[2727.64 --> 2728.64]  She didn't do that.
[2728.64 --> 2730.64]  She was a nice lady.
[2730.64 --> 2732.64]  She was righteous.
[2732.64 --> 2735.64]  But what did she do instead?
[2735.64 --> 2737.64]  She prayed to God.
[2737.64 --> 2741.64]  She trust God is in control in her life.
[2741.64 --> 2747.64]  And she also trust that the Lord is the final judge.
[2747.64 --> 2752.64]  And she will just do the right thing.
[2752.64 --> 2756.64]  And we need to learn from her in that point.
[2756.64 --> 2762.64]  We do not repay evil with evil, but we trust God is in control.
[2762.64 --> 2764.64]  He is the final judge.
[2764.64 --> 2771.64]  We will just do the right things that God wants us to do and leave the result, the outcomes to God.
[2771.64 --> 2773.64]  Okay, that's number one.
[2773.64 --> 2774.64]  Number two.
[2774.64 --> 2778.64]  Hannah was truthful before the Lord.
[2778.64 --> 2784.64]  She poured out her heart before the Lord, telling him everything about her life.
[2784.64 --> 2788.64]  So she cried out for help.
[2788.64 --> 2791.64]  Can we do that when we pray to God?
[2791.64 --> 2797.64]  Be truthful, telling God everything that is happening in our life.
[2797.64 --> 2799.64]  Yeah, we can do that, right?
[2799.64 --> 2801.64]  We can learn from her.
[2801.64 --> 2803.64]  Just be truthful before God.
[2803.64 --> 2806.64]  All right.
[2806.64 --> 2810.64]  So our prayers need to be truthful, huh?
[2810.64 --> 2811.64]  All right.
[2811.64 --> 2812.64]  Number three.
[2812.64 --> 2814.64]  Hannah was also faithful.
[2814.64 --> 2817.64]  She kept her promise to God.
[2817.64 --> 2819.64]  What was her promise?
[2819.64 --> 2820.64]  Do you guys remember?
[2820.64 --> 2822.64]  What did she promise God?
[2822.64 --> 2828.64]  If she has a baby, she would give it to the Lord.
[2828.64 --> 2835.64]  Give it to the temple so he would work for God his whole life.
[2835.64 --> 2836.64]  Yeah.
[2836.64 --> 2837.64]  That's her promise.
[2837.64 --> 2839.64]  Did she keep it?
[2839.64 --> 2840.64]  Yes.
[2840.64 --> 2841.64]  Yes.
[2841.64 --> 2846.64]  She kept her promise and she gave Samuel to Eli.
[2846.64 --> 2849.64]  So Samuel grew up in the temple.
[2849.64 --> 2854.64]  Later on, you will learn amazing things about Samuel in the Bible.
[2854.64 --> 2855.64]  Okay.
[2855.64 --> 2857.64]  So that's three points.
[2857.64 --> 2859.64]  So what is number one?
[2859.64 --> 2860.64]  Remember?
[2860.64 --> 2863.64]  To trust God.
[2863.64 --> 2864.64]  Trust God.
[2864.64 --> 2866.64]  Number one.
[2866.64 --> 2868.64]  Can we all say trust God?
[2868.64 --> 2869.64]  Okay.
[2869.64 --> 2870.64]  Okay.
[2870.64 --> 2871.64]  What is number two?
[2871.64 --> 2872.64]  Be truthful in your prayers.
[2872.64 --> 2886.64]  Tell God everything about ourselves.
[2886.64 --> 2888.64]  What is number three?
[2888.64 --> 2889.64]  What is number three?
[2889.64 --> 2891.64]  What is number three?
[2891.64 --> 2894.64]  What is number three?
[2894.64 --> 2895.64]  To keep our promise to God.
[2895.64 --> 2896.64]  Right?
[2896.64 --> 2897.64]  Like what Hannah did.
[2897.64 --> 2898.64]  So to keep promise to God.
[2898.64 --> 2899.64]  Alright.
[2899.64 --> 2900.64]  So we can all remember three things.
[2900.64 --> 2901.64]  Number one, trust God.
[2901.64 --> 2902.64]  Number two, be truthful in our prayers.
[2902.64 --> 2905.64]  Number three, to keep our promise to God.
[2905.64 --> 2912.30]  to God? All right. So we can all remember three things. Number one, trust God. Number
[2912.30 --> 2919.20]  two, be truthful in our prayers. Number three, to keep our promise to God. All right. That's
[2919.20 --> 2925.50]  my message today. Now let's pray. Okay. So close your eyes, hold your hand, let's pray.
[2927.48 --> 2934.08]  Dear Heavenly Father, help us to learn from the story of God. Help us to do what is right
[2934.08 --> 2941.84]  in our eyes and help us to learn to act in our life and learn from the three points we
[2941.84 --> 2949.88]  just learned. Trust God that you will help us and be truthful in our prayers and also keep
[2949.88 --> 2959.84]  our promise to you as well. And as we celebrate Mother's Day today, help us also remember what
[2959.84 --> 2969.60]  you have done on the cross for us. And because your blood shed, your body broken, and we can
[2969.60 --> 2976.56]  become children of God. Thank you for everything you have done in our lives. In Jesus' name
[2976.56 --> 2984.32]  I pray. Okay, boys and girls, I have some flowers here. Each one of you can take one and give it
[2984.32 --> 2991.72]  to your mom. And after that, if you agree to and up, you can go back to your seat. And the
[2991.72 --> 2999.32]  younger ones, you can go to your Sunday school class. Okay, thank you. Go take a flower. Give
[2999.32 --> 3000.32]  it to your mom.
[3000.32 --> 3002.32]  Give it to your mom.
[3029.32 --> 3032.32]  Give it to your mom, give it to your mom. So the next one here is yours. The second one in
[3032.32 --> 3034.32]  Sk Imp館 is $16, that's what we want to call the mountain you and in principles are
[3034.32 --> 3036.48]  made to you. If you are claiming that you are coming to learn. You want a song by
[3036.48 --> 3038.98]  of your mom. Give it to your mom. I say that we will ask you to call and play that
[3038.98 --> 3044.90]  moment. I say that this doesn't sound as different as true of each of us. What you
[3044.90 --> 3047.48]  actually can do, I apparently read every Michaelということ, and I remember I look into it and
[3047.48 --> 3049.50]  his gymnastics isиться as an intervention to you in a long Erfahrung by being allowed from the
[3049.50 --> 3052.96]  aliment Tambbury Council because we've about the Phantom of which we Harmony probably
[3052.96 --> 3053.62]  through this possibility, where you can take the��는 BushGu darkness. So what will anything and
[3053.62 --> 3056.34]  say is paling let us say that you would usually try whether he might be called in our
[3056.34 --> 3070.62]  Our scripture reading this morning is from Matthew 11, verse 25 to 30.
[3071.84 --> 3073.80]  At that time, Jesus said,
[3074.00 --> 3076.72]  I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[3077.00 --> 3080.36]  because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
[3080.36 --> 3082.40]  and revealed them to little children.
[3082.40 --> 3086.78]  Yes, Father, for this is what you are pleased to do.
[3087.34 --> 3091.02]  All things have been committed to me by my Father.
[3091.58 --> 3093.76]  No one knows the Son except the Father,
[3094.04 --> 3096.38]  and no one knows the Father except the Son,
[3097.18 --> 3100.56]  and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
[3101.84 --> 3105.72]  Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[3105.74 --> 3107.02]  and I will give you rest.
[3107.98 --> 3110.52]  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[3110.52 --> 3112.56]  for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[3112.86 --> 3115.00]  and you will find rest for your souls.
[3115.46 --> 3118.00]  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[3118.32 --> 3119.64]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3120.12 --> 3121.36]  Praise to you, Father.
[3121.36 --> 3121.78]  Amen.
[3121.78 --> 3140.74]  Well, the passage began with those words,
[3140.80 --> 3141.92]  at that time,
[3142.92 --> 3147.02]  well, what was happening at that time
[3147.02 --> 3150.54]  that made Jesus say what he did,
[3150.68 --> 3154.18]  extending these gracious words of invitation.
[3154.50 --> 3158.10]  Well, if you look at the beginning of Matthew chapter 11,
[3158.24 --> 3163.82]  you realize that Jesus' cousin John was in prison.
[3165.22 --> 3167.62]  He had called his political leader,
[3167.74 --> 3169.38]  you might say his own prime minister,
[3169.58 --> 3170.56]  on a moral issue,
[3170.56 --> 3174.80]  and he didn't like that kind of protest
[3174.80 --> 3175.96]  and put him in jail.
[3177.34 --> 3178.84]  And John's now wondering
[3178.84 --> 3184.34]  about the burden that he's being asked to bear.
[3185.92 --> 3189.70]  He had really hoped that Jesus would back him up
[3189.70 --> 3195.10]  and deal with the political powers
[3195.10 --> 3196.52]  that were rather corrupt,
[3196.52 --> 3198.40]  but to his appearances,
[3199.00 --> 3199.66]  he wasn't.
[3201.32 --> 3202.58]  So here's John.
[3202.66 --> 3204.32]  He's sitting in this dungeon.
[3205.64 --> 3207.20]  He's got lots of time to think,
[3208.02 --> 3211.62]  and he's starting to second-guess himself.
[3213.08 --> 3214.66]  And being who he is,
[3214.84 --> 3216.22]  he cuts to the chafe.
[3216.30 --> 3219.04]  He sends some of his followers,
[3219.20 --> 3219.86]  his disciples,
[3220.56 --> 3222.40]  to Jesus and says,
[3222.52 --> 3223.34]  so I've got to know,
[3223.98 --> 3225.84]  are you the one who is to come?
[3225.84 --> 3228.32]  Or should we expect someone else?
[3229.74 --> 3233.22]  And Jesus looks at John's disciples,
[3233.42 --> 3233.84]  and he says,
[3233.98 --> 3236.78]  you go back and you report to John
[3236.78 --> 3238.20]  what you see.
[3239.08 --> 3240.96]  The blind receive sight,
[3241.56 --> 3242.96]  the lame walk,
[3243.52 --> 3245.68]  those who have leprosy are cured,
[3246.34 --> 3247.44]  the deaf hear,
[3247.96 --> 3249.30]  the dead are raised,
[3249.54 --> 3252.32]  and the good news is preached to the poor.
[3252.32 --> 3256.04]  And then Jesus adds in Matthew 11 and 6,
[3257.64 --> 3262.70]  blessed is the one who does not fall away
[3262.70 --> 3265.28]  on account of me.
[3266.42 --> 3267.44]  In other words,
[3268.30 --> 3269.74]  hang in there, John.
[3269.74 --> 3274.52]  And then Jesus turns to his disciples,
[3275.56 --> 3277.36]  as he normally does,
[3277.42 --> 3278.44]  on-the-job training.
[3279.66 --> 3282.08]  And he explains how it can happen
[3282.08 --> 3284.40]  to good people like John
[3284.40 --> 3286.04]  that they end up in prison,
[3286.88 --> 3290.36]  and how even like with himself,
[3291.10 --> 3292.74]  things are kind of going south,
[3292.74 --> 3295.54]  and his approval ratings,
[3295.74 --> 3296.78]  Jesus that is,
[3297.20 --> 3298.16]  are not so good.
[3300.64 --> 3303.58]  Listen, Jesus says to his followers,
[3303.80 --> 3306.68]  these educated religious leaders,
[3306.88 --> 3308.96]  and he's referring there to the scribes
[3308.96 --> 3310.30]  and the Pharisees,
[3310.72 --> 3312.50]  they're impossible to please.
[3312.50 --> 3315.50]  It doesn't matter what you do,
[3315.64 --> 3316.98]  it's not good enough for them.
[3319.02 --> 3320.98]  We're in a no-win situation.
[3322.16 --> 3325.26]  And then Jesus compares that generation
[3325.26 --> 3328.54]  to children in the marketplace
[3328.54 --> 3331.10]  that can't get along.
[3332.66 --> 3334.52]  Like it doesn't matter what you offer them,
[3334.68 --> 3336.52]  it's not good enough.
[3337.00 --> 3338.72]  It's like you take kids shopping,
[3339.22 --> 3340.84]  you buy them a few treats,
[3340.84 --> 3343.02]  and they're still arguing
[3343.02 --> 3344.64]  and fighting with each other.
[3345.68 --> 3346.44]  No win.
[3347.20 --> 3348.46]  And Jesus wasn't winning,
[3349.34 --> 3353.12]  and he was getting some pretty bad press.
[3354.88 --> 3357.52]  So look, Jesus says to his disciples,
[3357.68 --> 3358.18]  you know when,
[3358.96 --> 3359.96]  paraphrasing here,
[3360.68 --> 3362.98]  when John the Baptist there,
[3363.04 --> 3364.08]  when he came, you know,
[3364.20 --> 3366.28]  eating vegan and sleeping in the van,
[3366.54 --> 3367.04]  he said,
[3367.28 --> 3368.26]  that guy's way out.
[3368.84 --> 3369.64]  He's a wacko.
[3369.64 --> 3372.86]  Well, I come doing all the good stuff,
[3373.10 --> 3373.34]  you know,
[3373.42 --> 3375.18]  and eating and drinking with people,
[3375.32 --> 3377.32]  and they call me a glutton and a drunkard.
[3378.82 --> 3380.76]  So he says in verse 16,
[3381.82 --> 3385.36]  these leaders are like spoiled children
[3385.36 --> 3388.38]  who can't be satisfied.
[3389.80 --> 3390.68]  It's like it doesn't matter
[3390.68 --> 3392.12]  what game you offer them,
[3392.28 --> 3393.40]  it's not good enough.
[3394.42 --> 3395.66]  They don't want to play.
[3395.66 --> 3399.40]  And then there's a rather harsh section.
[3400.22 --> 3403.44]  Jesus starts to denounce the towns
[3403.44 --> 3405.84]  he's just been in
[3405.84 --> 3410.40]  because he says they would not repent.
[3412.12 --> 3414.30]  And he gives strong warnings,
[3414.50 --> 3416.94]  and the text just before our passage is,
[3416.94 --> 3421.60]  it will be more bearable for Sodom,
[3422.88 --> 3424.52]  we might call that sin city,
[3424.72 --> 3426.08]  on the day of judgment,
[3426.48 --> 3429.18]  than for these cities that he'd just been in.
[3430.46 --> 3432.56]  Well, it's at that time,
[3433.78 --> 3434.84]  Jesus says,
[3435.56 --> 3436.92]  I praise you.
[3437.42 --> 3437.70]  I mean,
[3437.74 --> 3438.76]  he's quite something.
[3438.76 --> 3440.64]  I praise you,
[3441.02 --> 3441.34]  Father,
[3441.60 --> 3443.74]  Lord of heaven and earth,
[3444.42 --> 3447.46]  because you have hidden these things
[3447.46 --> 3449.68]  from the wise and learned
[3449.68 --> 3451.88]  and revealed them
[3451.88 --> 3453.68]  to little children,
[3453.88 --> 3454.46]  for yes,
[3454.60 --> 3454.94]  Father,
[3456.34 --> 3457.76]  that was your good pleasure.
[3459.84 --> 3461.78]  What are these things
[3461.78 --> 3465.94]  that the Sunday school children get,
[3465.94 --> 3469.60]  but the educated are missing?
[3470.66 --> 3475.56]  And why would it be God's good pleasure
[3475.56 --> 3478.84]  that the wise and the learned people
[3478.84 --> 3481.74]  don't get what the children did?
[3482.56 --> 3482.86]  I mean,
[3482.92 --> 3484.46]  shouldn't everyone get it?
[3484.72 --> 3485.40]  Really?
[3485.92 --> 3487.38]  Aren't these the very people
[3487.38 --> 3489.50]  who you want to get it?
[3490.56 --> 3491.20]  Intelligent,
[3491.70 --> 3492.44]  educated,
[3493.04 --> 3494.24]  influential people
[3494.24 --> 3495.78]  with life experience?
[3498.20 --> 3498.70]  Well,
[3498.80 --> 3499.62]  in answer to that,
[3499.72 --> 3500.28]  first of all,
[3500.40 --> 3501.14]  Jesus here,
[3502.42 --> 3503.02]  as anywhere,
[3503.14 --> 3504.80]  he's never rejoicing
[3504.80 --> 3506.22]  in unbelief.
[3507.68 --> 3509.50]  Jesus doesn't give thanks
[3509.50 --> 3511.70]  that there are reprobates,
[3511.80 --> 3512.36]  if you will.
[3513.74 --> 3516.00]  He's never grateful for unbelief.
[3516.00 --> 3517.68]  And even here,
[3518.34 --> 3521.34]  he's calling for faith.
[3521.34 --> 3527.24]  Neither is Jesus saying here
[3527.24 --> 3528.26]  that learning
[3528.26 --> 3531.28]  is useless.
[3532.28 --> 3533.94]  He's not condemning
[3533.94 --> 3536.46]  intellectual power.
[3536.82 --> 3539.56]  Jesus himself is all-wise.
[3539.80 --> 3541.82]  There's no intellect
[3541.82 --> 3543.34]  to be compared
[3543.34 --> 3544.58]  with Jesus.
[3545.92 --> 3548.40]  What he is speaking to
[3548.40 --> 3550.48]  is intellectual pride.
[3551.34 --> 3553.12]  See,
[3553.22 --> 3555.84]  intellect doesn't shut Jesus out,
[3556.36 --> 3557.70]  but pride does.
[3558.94 --> 3560.14]  Sharp minds
[3560.14 --> 3561.28]  always have
[3561.28 --> 3562.28]  and will continue
[3562.28 --> 3564.22]  to come to Christ.
[3564.92 --> 3566.54]  But self-made
[3566.54 --> 3567.98]  know-it-alls
[3567.98 --> 3569.54]  have no need
[3569.54 --> 3570.70]  for this teacher.
[3571.80 --> 3573.28]  They're self-taught.
[3573.28 --> 3576.80]  So Jesus isn't looking
[3576.80 --> 3577.76]  for ignorance,
[3578.18 --> 3579.24]  but for humility.
[3580.60 --> 3582.96]  For the trusting innocence
[3582.96 --> 3584.56]  of a child
[3584.56 --> 3586.30]  that will accept
[3586.30 --> 3587.86]  these things.
[3589.66 --> 3591.16]  Well, what are these things
[3591.16 --> 3593.40]  that a child can comprehend?
[3594.88 --> 3596.06]  Well, at first glance,
[3596.16 --> 3597.80]  what Jesus says next
[3597.80 --> 3599.26]  doesn't sound like anything
[3599.26 --> 3600.12]  you would hear
[3600.12 --> 3602.10]  in Sunday school.
[3602.10 --> 3603.86]  It sounds more like material
[3603.86 --> 3605.26]  that you would hear
[3605.26 --> 3606.54]  in a seminary.
[3607.30 --> 3608.58]  And in all fairness,
[3608.78 --> 3609.66]  Jesus is here
[3609.66 --> 3611.28]  talking to adults
[3611.28 --> 3613.18]  when he next says,
[3613.18 --> 3616.38]  All things
[3616.38 --> 3618.30]  have been committed
[3618.30 --> 3619.90]  to me
[3619.90 --> 3621.70]  by my Father.
[3623.38 --> 3625.02]  No one knows
[3625.02 --> 3625.78]  the Son
[3625.78 --> 3628.00]  except the Father.
[3630.06 --> 3631.94]  And no one knows
[3631.94 --> 3632.92]  the Father
[3632.92 --> 3635.48]  except the Son.
[3635.48 --> 3638.40]  and those
[3638.40 --> 3638.96]  to whom
[3638.96 --> 3639.86]  the Son
[3639.86 --> 3640.78]  chooses
[3640.78 --> 3642.82]  to reveal Him.
[3646.24 --> 3647.24]  Now, there's always
[3647.24 --> 3648.52]  mystery and wonder
[3648.52 --> 3649.28]  attached
[3649.28 --> 3650.70]  to Jesus.
[3651.26 --> 3653.60]  The kind of mystery
[3653.60 --> 3654.24]  that
[3654.24 --> 3656.44]  adults want
[3656.44 --> 3658.18]  to figure all out
[3658.18 --> 3659.44]  while kids
[3659.44 --> 3660.36]  will sit
[3660.36 --> 3662.06]  and marvel at.
[3662.06 --> 3664.66]  For example,
[3664.92 --> 3665.86]  an astronomer
[3665.86 --> 3666.64]  will look up
[3666.64 --> 3668.08]  into the night sky
[3668.08 --> 3671.94]  and study it forever
[3671.94 --> 3673.04]  while a child
[3673.04 --> 3674.26]  will lay back
[3674.26 --> 3675.62]  and just
[3675.62 --> 3676.44]  be
[3676.44 --> 3677.48]  amazed.
[3679.36 --> 3679.60]  Now,
[3679.72 --> 3680.50]  some astronomers
[3680.50 --> 3680.98]  are too,
[3681.08 --> 3681.84]  don't get me wrong.
[3682.30 --> 3682.82]  But it's like
[3682.82 --> 3683.58]  some bookish
[3683.58 --> 3684.50]  theologians.
[3685.00 --> 3686.00]  They'll try
[3686.00 --> 3686.98]  to discover
[3686.98 --> 3688.26]  the real
[3688.26 --> 3689.04]  historical
[3689.56 --> 3690.30]  Jesus
[3690.30 --> 3691.72]  while kids
[3691.72 --> 3692.40]  want to just
[3692.40 --> 3693.24]  hear the story.
[3696.24 --> 3697.46]  Let me digress.
[3697.92 --> 3698.68]  Tell you a story
[3698.68 --> 3699.20]  I think
[3699.20 --> 3699.92]  makes the point.
[3700.84 --> 3701.70]  We have a
[3701.70 --> 3703.22]  preschooler,
[3703.56 --> 3704.32]  our granddaughter,
[3705.02 --> 3705.60]  Hadley,
[3705.72 --> 3706.28]  she's five.
[3707.54 --> 3708.24]  She was
[3708.24 --> 3709.42]  completely
[3709.42 --> 3709.94]  enamored
[3709.94 --> 3710.54]  with Santa.
[3711.92 --> 3712.84]  She came in
[3712.84 --> 3713.58]  touting him
[3713.58 --> 3714.20]  and I saw
[3714.20 --> 3715.84]  false teaching.
[3716.10 --> 3716.60]  Oh boy,
[3716.78 --> 3717.42]  a granddaughter
[3717.42 --> 3718.18]  embracing
[3718.18 --> 3719.24]  myths.
[3719.24 --> 3720.64]  and my wife
[3720.64 --> 3721.14]  could see it.
[3721.18 --> 3721.54]  She says,
[3721.60 --> 3721.80]  no,
[3721.94 --> 3722.16]  no,
[3722.32 --> 3723.74]  you don't
[3723.74 --> 3724.22]  go there.
[3724.34 --> 3724.78]  But I
[3724.78 --> 3725.58]  couldn't resist
[3725.58 --> 3726.30]  so I took
[3726.30 --> 3728.10]  the apologetic
[3728.10 --> 3728.98]  approach.
[3729.42 --> 3729.66]  I said,
[3729.74 --> 3730.14]  Hadley,
[3730.92 --> 3731.68]  would you tell
[3731.68 --> 3732.42]  me about
[3732.42 --> 3733.16]  who Santa
[3733.16 --> 3733.66]  is?
[3734.04 --> 3734.26]  Well,
[3735.34 --> 3736.00]  she was
[3736.00 --> 3736.68]  rather eager.
[3736.82 --> 3737.40]  She got up
[3737.40 --> 3737.92]  on the chair
[3737.92 --> 3738.54]  beside me
[3738.54 --> 3739.06]  in the study
[3739.06 --> 3739.48]  and she
[3739.48 --> 3739.96]  went on,
[3740.06 --> 3740.70]  I would say,
[3740.98 --> 3741.58]  for well
[3741.58 --> 3742.42]  over a minute.
[3743.46 --> 3744.22]  And she's
[3744.22 --> 3745.44]  describing Santa
[3745.44 --> 3746.38]  and how good
[3746.38 --> 3746.72]  he is
[3746.72 --> 3747.58]  and how amazing
[3747.58 --> 3748.18]  he is,
[3748.48 --> 3749.08]  how he goes
[3749.08 --> 3749.62]  around the
[3749.62 --> 3750.52]  world and
[3750.52 --> 3751.02]  he's giving
[3751.02 --> 3751.78]  people gifts
[3751.78 --> 3752.36]  and then she
[3752.36 --> 3753.12]  started naming
[3753.12 --> 3754.50]  all the ones
[3754.50 --> 3755.24]  in the family
[3755.24 --> 3756.08]  she could think
[3756.08 --> 3756.32]  of,
[3756.38 --> 3756.58]  you know,
[3756.70 --> 3757.04]  Grandpa
[3757.04 --> 3757.64]  and Beppa
[3757.64 --> 3757.90]  and,
[3758.32 --> 3758.74]  you know,
[3759.42 --> 3760.10]  all her
[3760.10 --> 3760.64]  cousins.
[3762.24 --> 3763.02]  And then
[3763.02 --> 3763.86]  she says,
[3764.50 --> 3765.04]  he goes,
[3765.22 --> 3765.96]  and this is
[3765.96 --> 3766.74]  an actual quote,
[3766.86 --> 3767.16]  she said,
[3767.22 --> 3767.98]  she gives gifts
[3767.98 --> 3768.76]  to everyone,
[3769.34 --> 3770.30]  even Americans.
[3770.30 --> 3773.44]  I'm looking,
[3773.80 --> 3774.88]  they're smiling
[3774.88 --> 3775.82]  like crazy.
[3776.74 --> 3777.60]  What can I say?
[3777.70 --> 3778.32]  It made me wonder
[3778.32 --> 3779.18]  what they're talking
[3779.18 --> 3779.78]  about in their
[3779.78 --> 3780.20]  family,
[3780.30 --> 3780.84]  but anyways.
[3782.62 --> 3783.16]  A little later
[3783.16 --> 3783.54]  I said,
[3783.62 --> 3784.26]  so Hadley,
[3784.78 --> 3785.80]  what happens
[3785.80 --> 3786.32]  if Santa
[3786.32 --> 3787.04]  doesn't give
[3787.04 --> 3787.82]  a gift to me?
[3789.26 --> 3789.74]  Well,
[3789.86 --> 3790.52]  then I guess
[3790.52 --> 3791.24]  that just means
[3791.24 --> 3792.04]  you've been naughty.
[3793.72 --> 3794.20]  She
[3794.20 --> 3795.26]  was dead
[3795.26 --> 3795.84]  serious.
[3797.76 --> 3798.62]  She believed
[3798.62 --> 3798.82]  it.
[3800.30 --> 3802.02]  well,
[3802.18 --> 3802.96]  I did have a word
[3802.96 --> 3803.54]  with her mother
[3803.54 --> 3805.18]  and hey,
[3805.32 --> 3806.02]  in the end
[3806.02 --> 3806.58]  the truth
[3806.58 --> 3807.02]  went out.
[3807.10 --> 3807.60]  I found out
[3807.60 --> 3808.58]  this past week
[3808.58 --> 3812.00]  that news
[3812.00 --> 3812.80]  had got out
[3812.80 --> 3814.88]  that her
[3814.88 --> 3815.74]  cousin,
[3815.94 --> 3816.22]  I believe
[3816.22 --> 3817.22]  it was Nico,
[3817.58 --> 3818.66]  said that her
[3818.66 --> 3819.90]  mother went
[3819.90 --> 3820.78]  to the store
[3820.78 --> 3821.66]  and bought
[3821.66 --> 3822.18]  gifts.
[3824.60 --> 3825.50]  So she had
[3825.50 --> 3826.24]  to confirm
[3826.24 --> 3826.90]  that,
[3827.18 --> 3827.56]  I said,
[3827.60 --> 3828.02]  is it really
[3828.02 --> 3828.46]  true?
[3828.72 --> 3828.96]  Yeah,
[3829.04 --> 3829.50]  she said
[3829.50 --> 3830.02]  it's true.
[3830.30 --> 3831.68]  people buy
[3831.68 --> 3832.26]  these gifts
[3832.26 --> 3832.76]  and Santa
[3832.76 --> 3834.00]  doesn't deliver
[3834.00 --> 3834.28]  them.
[3836.08 --> 3836.82]  Thank you,
[3836.88 --> 3837.10]  Lord.
[3837.22 --> 3837.42]  You know,
[3837.46 --> 3837.80]  it's like
[3837.80 --> 3838.66]  finally she
[3838.66 --> 3839.20]  got the,
[3839.68 --> 3841.06]  here's the
[3841.06 --> 3841.40]  point,
[3841.70 --> 3842.44]  kids will
[3842.44 --> 3843.00]  believe
[3843.00 --> 3844.06]  just about
[3844.06 --> 3845.04]  anything
[3845.04 --> 3846.30]  you tell
[3846.30 --> 3846.52]  them.
[3846.52 --> 3850.34]  and if you
[3850.34 --> 3851.48]  tell children
[3851.48 --> 3853.28]  the truth
[3853.28 --> 3855.10]  that the
[3855.10 --> 3855.70]  God of
[3855.70 --> 3856.72]  this amazing
[3856.72 --> 3857.56]  universe
[3857.56 --> 3858.86]  came down
[3858.86 --> 3859.56]  in the
[3859.56 --> 3860.04]  shape
[3860.04 --> 3860.48]  and the
[3860.48 --> 3860.86]  person
[3860.86 --> 3861.50]  of a
[3861.50 --> 3861.98]  baby,
[3862.54 --> 3862.88]  they'll
[3862.88 --> 3863.52]  believe it.
[3864.86 --> 3865.56]  And if you
[3865.56 --> 3865.88]  tell them
[3865.88 --> 3866.66]  he walks
[3866.66 --> 3867.10]  around
[3867.10 --> 3867.92]  and he did
[3867.92 --> 3868.62]  amazing
[3868.62 --> 3869.26]  miracles
[3869.26 --> 3870.34]  and he spoke
[3870.34 --> 3871.00]  these wonderful
[3871.00 --> 3871.34]  things,
[3871.66 --> 3872.30]  they'll believe
[3872.30 --> 3872.58]  it.
[3874.82 --> 3876.10]  They get
[3876.10 --> 3876.44]  it.
[3878.56 --> 3879.82]  That's why
[3879.82 --> 3880.28]  they were the
[3880.28 --> 3880.80]  ones that
[3880.80 --> 3881.50]  could see it
[3881.50 --> 3881.96]  when they
[3881.96 --> 3883.12]  met Jesus.
[3883.26 --> 3884.00]  This man is
[3884.00 --> 3884.60]  special,
[3885.00 --> 3885.42]  he's got
[3885.42 --> 3887.46]  special powers
[3887.46 --> 3889.14]  and they
[3889.14 --> 3890.38]  accepted it
[3890.38 --> 3891.94]  but the
[3891.94 --> 3892.48]  learned
[3892.48 --> 3893.48]  people
[3893.48 --> 3894.72]  didn't.
[3897.72 --> 3899.16]  What Jesus
[3899.16 --> 3900.04]  has just
[3900.04 --> 3900.90]  stated is
[3900.90 --> 3901.88]  ultimately the
[3901.88 --> 3903.50]  core of
[3903.50 --> 3904.10]  the biblical
[3904.10 --> 3905.26]  story.
[3906.48 --> 3907.32]  How God
[3907.32 --> 3908.24]  has committed
[3908.24 --> 3910.10]  all things
[3910.10 --> 3911.28]  to his
[3911.28 --> 3911.72]  son.
[3913.36 --> 3913.96]  That's the
[3913.96 --> 3914.98]  central teaching
[3914.98 --> 3915.36]  of the
[3915.36 --> 3915.80]  gospel.
[3915.80 --> 3917.84]  God has
[3917.84 --> 3919.14]  chosen to
[3919.14 --> 3919.74]  work through
[3919.74 --> 3921.16]  his son to
[3921.16 --> 3923.30]  accomplish all
[3923.30 --> 3924.30]  his purposes
[3924.30 --> 3925.68]  on this
[3925.68 --> 3926.00]  earth.
[3927.76 --> 3928.78]  All things
[3928.78 --> 3929.24]  committed.
[3930.46 --> 3930.98]  The kids
[3930.98 --> 3931.60]  could sense
[3931.60 --> 3932.12]  who Jesus
[3932.12 --> 3932.64]  was.
[3933.64 --> 3934.02]  They were
[3934.02 --> 3934.70]  in awe
[3934.70 --> 3937.32]  how gentle
[3937.32 --> 3938.12]  he was,
[3938.56 --> 3939.22]  how humble
[3939.22 --> 3940.84]  but the
[3940.84 --> 3941.70]  theologians,
[3941.88 --> 3942.34]  they're still
[3942.34 --> 3943.34]  trying to
[3943.34 --> 3944.98]  figure him
[3944.98 --> 3945.42]  out.
[3945.80 --> 3946.84]  to dissect
[3946.84 --> 3947.18]  him,
[3948.04 --> 3948.88]  keeping him
[3948.88 --> 3950.80]  at a safe
[3950.80 --> 3951.56]  distance.
[3952.94 --> 3953.62]  Thank you.
[3953.70 --> 3954.40]  I praise you
[3954.40 --> 3955.46]  Father that you
[3955.46 --> 3956.14]  haven't revealed
[3956.14 --> 3956.98]  to them because
[3956.98 --> 3957.70]  if you had,
[3958.14 --> 3958.72]  these others
[3958.72 --> 3959.04]  would have
[3959.04 --> 3959.54]  missed it.
[3962.86 --> 3963.62]  Listen to
[3963.62 --> 3964.02]  Jesus,
[3964.20 --> 3964.82]  no one knows
[3964.82 --> 3965.48]  the Father in
[3965.48 --> 3966.30]  heaven like I
[3966.30 --> 3966.90]  do and no
[3966.90 --> 3967.32]  one knows
[3967.32 --> 3967.86]  the Father,
[3968.04 --> 3968.96]  knows me like
[3968.96 --> 3969.44]  the Father
[3969.44 --> 3970.10]  does and we
[3970.10 --> 3970.52]  have this
[3970.52 --> 3971.00]  rich,
[3971.64 --> 3972.02]  full
[3972.02 --> 3973.36]  relationship.
[3973.36 --> 3975.56]  as Father
[3975.56 --> 3976.14]  and Son.
[3977.30 --> 3977.82]  And here's
[3977.82 --> 3978.38]  the kicker,
[3978.68 --> 3979.48]  you're invited
[3979.48 --> 3980.28]  into this
[3980.28 --> 3981.10]  relationship
[3981.10 --> 3982.26]  of love
[3982.26 --> 3983.58]  and unity.
[3984.02 --> 3984.54]  It's for
[3984.54 --> 3984.98]  everyone.
[3986.28 --> 3987.66]  But we
[3987.66 --> 3988.66]  don't get to
[3988.66 --> 3989.70]  set the terms
[3989.70 --> 3990.56]  of endearment.
[3991.60 --> 3992.50]  God comes to
[3992.50 --> 3993.70]  us as a gift
[3993.70 --> 3994.52]  from above
[3994.52 --> 3995.26]  through his
[3995.26 --> 3996.10]  son Jesus,
[3997.18 --> 3997.84]  revealing
[3997.84 --> 3998.94]  God's
[3998.94 --> 3999.76]  heart
[3999.76 --> 4002.50]  and inviting
[4002.50 --> 4003.50]  us into
[4003.50 --> 4004.38]  his goodness
[4004.38 --> 4005.22]  and his
[4005.22 --> 4005.64]  love.
[4007.26 --> 4008.10]  And when
[4008.10 --> 4009.44]  anyone allows
[4009.44 --> 4010.66]  themselves to
[4010.66 --> 4012.00]  so be drawn
[4012.00 --> 4012.72]  to Jesus
[4012.72 --> 4014.12]  and not resist
[4014.12 --> 4014.86]  his inviting
[4014.86 --> 4015.42]  spirit,
[4015.92 --> 4017.02]  we are pulled
[4017.02 --> 4017.62]  into this
[4017.62 --> 4019.14]  incredibly rich,
[4020.18 --> 4021.00]  redemptive
[4021.00 --> 4022.08]  relationship
[4022.08 --> 4023.18]  with God.
[4025.18 --> 4026.54]  No degrees
[4026.54 --> 4027.30]  necessary.
[4027.84 --> 4029.78]  all we need
[4029.78 --> 4030.50]  is to know
[4030.50 --> 4031.80]  about God
[4031.80 --> 4032.54]  and how to
[4032.54 --> 4033.12]  live in this
[4033.12 --> 4035.00]  world starts
[4035.00 --> 4035.78]  and ends
[4035.78 --> 4036.60]  with listening
[4036.60 --> 4037.76]  to the voice
[4037.76 --> 4038.88]  of Jesus
[4038.88 --> 4040.46]  and learning
[4040.46 --> 4041.42]  from him.
[4042.80 --> 4043.50]  As Colossians
[4043.50 --> 4043.84]  says,
[4043.94 --> 4044.70]  Jesus is the
[4044.70 --> 4045.80]  center of
[4045.80 --> 4046.44]  all thought.
[4047.72 --> 4048.26]  In him
[4048.26 --> 4048.70]  are hidden
[4048.70 --> 4049.50]  all the
[4049.50 --> 4049.94]  treasures
[4049.94 --> 4051.16]  of wisdom
[4051.16 --> 4052.42]  and knowledge.
[4053.26 --> 4054.08]  Jesus helps
[4054.08 --> 4054.64]  us think
[4054.64 --> 4055.16]  clearly.
[4055.16 --> 4057.42]  he carries
[4057.42 --> 4058.08]  the secret
[4058.08 --> 4058.84]  to God's
[4058.84 --> 4059.56]  predestined
[4059.56 --> 4060.24]  plan
[4060.24 --> 4061.32]  for this
[4061.32 --> 4061.74]  world
[4061.74 --> 4062.42]  and how
[4062.42 --> 4062.94]  to live
[4062.94 --> 4064.04]  in it.
[4065.58 --> 4066.08]  And so
[4066.08 --> 4066.72]  it is this
[4066.72 --> 4067.18]  Jesus
[4067.18 --> 4067.98]  who then
[4067.98 --> 4069.28]  issues the
[4069.28 --> 4070.20]  call to
[4070.20 --> 4071.00]  all people.
[4071.68 --> 4072.14]  Come to
[4072.14 --> 4072.40]  me,
[4073.12 --> 4074.22]  all of you
[4074.22 --> 4075.48]  who are
[4075.48 --> 4076.22]  weary and
[4076.22 --> 4077.02]  burdened
[4077.02 --> 4077.74]  and I'll
[4077.74 --> 4078.12]  give you
[4078.12 --> 4078.54]  rest.
[4078.54 --> 4081.12]  take my
[4081.12 --> 4081.88]  yoke upon
[4081.88 --> 4084.20]  upon you
[4084.20 --> 4084.84]  and learn
[4084.84 --> 4085.40]  from me
[4085.40 --> 4085.88]  for I am
[4085.88 --> 4086.52]  gentle
[4086.52 --> 4087.78]  and humble
[4087.78 --> 4088.40]  in heart
[4088.40 --> 4090.06]  and you
[4090.06 --> 4091.00]  will find
[4091.00 --> 4091.60]  rest
[4091.60 --> 4092.88]  for your
[4092.88 --> 4093.54]  souls.
[4095.54 --> 4096.44]  For my
[4096.44 --> 4096.86]  yoke is
[4096.86 --> 4097.24]  easy
[4097.24 --> 4099.42]  and my
[4099.42 --> 4099.86]  burden
[4099.86 --> 4101.32]  is light.
[4103.46 --> 4104.06]  And so
[4104.06 --> 4105.54]  in their
[4105.54 --> 4106.16]  day to
[4106.16 --> 4106.88]  anyone who
[4106.88 --> 4107.72]  was exhausted
[4107.72 --> 4110.42]  trying to
[4110.42 --> 4111.20]  eke out
[4111.20 --> 4112.34]  a living,
[4114.06 --> 4115.22]  today to
[4115.22 --> 4116.10]  those trying
[4116.10 --> 4117.18]  to measure
[4117.18 --> 4117.94]  up and
[4117.94 --> 4118.70]  burdened by
[4118.70 --> 4119.32]  the pressure
[4119.32 --> 4120.44]  to succeed,
[4121.12 --> 4122.50]  Jesus offers
[4122.50 --> 4123.78]  rest and
[4123.78 --> 4124.24]  peace.
[4125.72 --> 4126.88]  There's a
[4126.88 --> 4127.38]  lot of
[4127.38 --> 4127.84]  weariness
[4127.84 --> 4129.26]  in our
[4129.26 --> 4129.66]  world.
[4131.10 --> 4132.34]  A lot
[4132.34 --> 4133.08]  of burdens.
[4134.58 --> 4135.72]  Doesn't matter
[4135.72 --> 4136.38]  where you go,
[4137.38 --> 4138.80]  business world,
[4139.52 --> 4140.46]  political world,
[4141.18 --> 4141.82]  education,
[4142.36 --> 4143.00]  and even
[4143.00 --> 4143.76]  the church.
[4144.76 --> 4145.62]  People are
[4145.62 --> 4146.84]  pushing their
[4146.84 --> 4147.40]  agendas.
[4148.78 --> 4149.28]  In our
[4149.28 --> 4150.28]  competitive world
[4150.28 --> 4150.88]  there's a lot
[4150.88 --> 4151.68]  of push and
[4151.68 --> 4151.96]  shove.
[4153.64 --> 4154.50]  Some win,
[4155.08 --> 4155.88]  most don't,
[4156.92 --> 4157.70]  and pretty much
[4157.70 --> 4158.44]  everyone gets
[4158.44 --> 4159.08]  worn out.
[4159.08 --> 4161.34]  you know,
[4161.38 --> 4161.82]  I think that's
[4161.82 --> 4162.32]  why people
[4162.32 --> 4162.80]  are often
[4162.80 --> 4163.78]  so glad
[4163.78 --> 4165.42]  to get
[4165.42 --> 4165.88]  on a
[4165.88 --> 4166.32]  plane,
[4166.56 --> 4166.94]  you know,
[4167.00 --> 4167.56]  let's get
[4167.56 --> 4168.06]  out of here
[4168.06 --> 4168.62]  and go
[4168.62 --> 4169.16]  somewhere.
[4170.20 --> 4171.06]  Never mind
[4171.06 --> 4171.38]  if the
[4171.38 --> 4172.16]  plane uses,
[4172.28 --> 4172.52]  you know,
[4172.62 --> 4173.14]  crude oil,
[4173.26 --> 4173.88]  just get
[4173.88 --> 4174.48]  on it
[4174.48 --> 4175.06]  to the
[4175.06 --> 4175.48]  sunshine
[4175.48 --> 4176.16]  somewhere
[4176.16 --> 4176.90]  and let
[4176.90 --> 4177.84]  me relax.
[4179.58 --> 4180.34]  But we've
[4180.34 --> 4180.80]  been there.
[4181.08 --> 4181.66]  Phoenix is
[4181.66 --> 4182.28]  no fix.
[4182.60 --> 4183.10]  It's nice.
[4186.16 --> 4186.72]  The folks,
[4186.94 --> 4187.38]  Jesus,
[4187.38 --> 4188.96]  is particularly
[4188.96 --> 4190.14]  speaking to
[4190.14 --> 4191.70]  were burdened
[4191.70 --> 4192.08]  in a
[4192.08 --> 4193.60]  religious way.
[4193.84 --> 4194.14]  They had
[4194.14 --> 4195.16]  these obligations,
[4195.54 --> 4197.26]  this well
[4197.26 --> 4198.12]  worked out
[4198.12 --> 4199.00]  system of
[4199.00 --> 4199.80]  thought and
[4199.80 --> 4200.50]  behavior,
[4201.14 --> 4201.80]  pretty much
[4201.80 --> 4202.68]  impossible to
[4202.68 --> 4202.94]  keep.
[4203.74 --> 4203.96]  You know,
[4203.98 --> 4204.46]  they put on
[4204.46 --> 4205.10]  a good show.
[4206.60 --> 4207.12]  And church
[4207.12 --> 4207.68]  can become
[4207.68 --> 4208.28]  like that if
[4208.28 --> 4208.66]  we aren't
[4208.66 --> 4209.08]  careful.
[4209.24 --> 4209.64]  It becomes
[4209.64 --> 4210.58]  a place of
[4210.58 --> 4211.64]  pressure and
[4211.64 --> 4213.00]  obligations and
[4213.00 --> 4213.32]  we're going to
[4213.32 --> 4214.20]  make it happen.
[4215.56 --> 4216.42]  And when we
[4216.42 --> 4217.26]  start forcing,
[4217.38 --> 4218.08]  Jesus talks
[4218.08 --> 4218.58]  about that in
[4218.58 --> 4219.38]  Matthew 11 as
[4219.38 --> 4219.52]  well,
[4219.56 --> 4220.28]  those who try
[4220.28 --> 4220.84]  and force
[4220.84 --> 4221.30]  their way
[4221.30 --> 4221.62]  into the
[4221.62 --> 4221.82]  kingdom.
[4221.92 --> 4222.06]  In other
[4222.06 --> 4222.18]  words,
[4222.22 --> 4222.98]  they've got
[4222.98 --> 4223.82]  a system and
[4223.82 --> 4224.10]  they're going
[4224.10 --> 4224.72]  to make it
[4224.72 --> 4225.12]  happen.
[4226.70 --> 4227.48]  And when we
[4227.48 --> 4228.08]  start doing
[4228.08 --> 4228.62]  that in the
[4228.62 --> 4229.42]  name of God,
[4229.80 --> 4230.62]  it gets
[4230.62 --> 4231.14]  ugly.
[4231.34 --> 4231.72]  There's
[4231.72 --> 4232.70]  spiritual
[4232.70 --> 4233.76]  carnage.
[4234.04 --> 4235.10]  Souls get
[4235.10 --> 4236.14]  scarred and
[4236.14 --> 4237.56]  hearts are
[4237.56 --> 4238.28]  made weary
[4238.28 --> 4239.80]  by all the
[4239.80 --> 4241.08]  obligations and
[4241.08 --> 4241.90]  the accompanying
[4241.90 --> 4242.82]  tensions.
[4242.82 --> 4243.06]  religions.
[4244.28 --> 4245.32]  I've lived
[4245.32 --> 4247.46]  with it and
[4247.46 --> 4248.46]  I confess at
[4248.46 --> 4249.88]  times I've
[4249.88 --> 4251.12]  been responsible
[4251.12 --> 4252.72]  for it.
[4253.84 --> 4254.96]  And it's
[4254.96 --> 4255.96]  not the
[4255.96 --> 4257.14]  way of
[4257.14 --> 4257.74]  Christ.
[4259.50 --> 4260.56]  And it's
[4260.56 --> 4262.72]  in part why
[4262.72 --> 4263.88]  our culture
[4263.88 --> 4264.72]  has pretty
[4264.72 --> 4265.66]  much thrown
[4265.66 --> 4267.02]  organized
[4267.02 --> 4268.58]  religion out
[4268.58 --> 4269.50]  because they
[4269.50 --> 4271.14]  see it as
[4271.14 --> 4272.22]  basically
[4272.22 --> 4273.48]  legalistic
[4273.48 --> 4275.48]  hardships that
[4275.48 --> 4277.14]  strip joy
[4277.14 --> 4278.68]  and peace
[4278.68 --> 4279.70]  from people's
[4279.70 --> 4280.42]  lives rather
[4280.42 --> 4281.04]  than giving
[4281.04 --> 4281.32]  it.
[4284.14 --> 4284.76]  Of course,
[4284.92 --> 4286.62]  it's a fair
[4286.62 --> 4287.50]  question to
[4287.50 --> 4289.24]  ask whether
[4289.24 --> 4290.56]  or not the
[4290.56 --> 4291.48]  people of
[4291.48 --> 4292.62]  this generation
[4292.62 --> 4293.84]  are more at
[4293.84 --> 4295.28]  rest without
[4295.28 --> 4295.94]  religion.
[4295.94 --> 4298.64]  is this
[4298.64 --> 4299.62]  churchless
[4299.62 --> 4300.72]  generation
[4300.72 --> 4301.76]  around us
[4301.76 --> 4302.48]  more
[4302.48 --> 4303.66]  peaceful?
[4305.30 --> 4306.42]  I don't
[4306.42 --> 4306.94]  think so.
[4308.34 --> 4309.02]  And the
[4309.02 --> 4309.72]  reason is
[4309.72 --> 4310.92]  because I
[4310.92 --> 4311.50]  believe,
[4312.02 --> 4312.34]  you see,
[4312.52 --> 4313.38]  everyone's
[4313.38 --> 4315.24]  created to
[4315.24 --> 4316.84]  be and you
[4316.84 --> 4317.76]  see vestiges
[4317.76 --> 4318.22]  of it in
[4318.22 --> 4319.10]  every person
[4319.10 --> 4320.88]  like God
[4320.88 --> 4321.60]  made in
[4321.60 --> 4322.22]  his image.
[4323.42 --> 4324.14]  And that's
[4324.14 --> 4324.86]  why it's
[4324.86 --> 4325.42]  innate
[4325.42 --> 4326.56]  in every
[4326.56 --> 4327.38]  single person
[4327.38 --> 4328.16]  you meet
[4328.16 --> 4329.82]  that they
[4329.82 --> 4330.52]  want life
[4330.52 --> 4330.92]  to be
[4330.92 --> 4331.26]  good.
[4333.74 --> 4335.00]  They want
[4335.00 --> 4335.58]  to do what
[4335.58 --> 4336.10]  they think
[4336.10 --> 4336.78]  is right.
[4339.12 --> 4340.08]  But our
[4340.08 --> 4341.36]  culture is
[4341.36 --> 4342.92]  now redefining
[4342.92 --> 4344.28]  what they
[4344.28 --> 4344.94]  think is
[4344.94 --> 4345.92]  right and
[4345.92 --> 4346.50]  they're doing
[4346.50 --> 4347.48]  it in their
[4347.48 --> 4348.94]  own eyes
[4348.94 --> 4349.72]  like happened
[4349.72 --> 4350.30]  in the book
[4350.30 --> 4351.08]  of Judges
[4351.08 --> 4352.92]  and they
[4352.92 --> 4353.68]  we have
[4353.68 --> 4354.14]  gotten
[4354.14 --> 4355.14]  ourselves
[4355.14 --> 4356.36]  into a
[4356.36 --> 4356.82]  very
[4356.82 --> 4358.14]  confusing
[4358.14 --> 4359.08]  and
[4359.08 --> 4360.40]  wearying
[4360.40 --> 4361.44]  mess.
[4362.44 --> 4363.38]  And I
[4363.38 --> 4364.06]  don't see it
[4364.06 --> 4364.50]  getting
[4364.50 --> 4365.22]  better.
[4368.22 --> 4369.30]  Now in this
[4369.30 --> 4369.74]  regard,
[4370.04 --> 4370.72]  no one is
[4370.72 --> 4371.28]  exempt.
[4372.42 --> 4373.48]  We all
[4373.48 --> 4374.54]  equally
[4374.54 --> 4375.60]  need to
[4375.60 --> 4376.06]  listen
[4376.06 --> 4377.22]  and be
[4377.22 --> 4378.00]  drawn
[4378.00 --> 4379.44]  particularly
[4379.44 --> 4380.90]  to the
[4380.90 --> 4381.52]  heart
[4381.52 --> 4382.82]  of Jesus.
[4384.50 --> 4385.10]  And I
[4385.10 --> 4385.64]  have to ask
[4385.64 --> 4386.08]  myself,
[4386.64 --> 4387.42]  how well
[4387.42 --> 4388.16]  do I
[4388.16 --> 4388.78]  know
[4388.78 --> 4390.10]  the heart
[4390.10 --> 4392.00]  of God?
[4392.00 --> 4398.22]  there's no
[4398.22 --> 4399.10]  better teacher
[4399.10 --> 4399.96]  than Jesus
[4399.96 --> 4402.90]  who describes
[4402.90 --> 4403.78]  himself as
[4403.78 --> 4404.50]  gentle
[4404.50 --> 4406.60]  and humble.
[4408.78 --> 4409.10]  And when
[4409.10 --> 4409.80]  we think
[4409.80 --> 4410.42]  of gentle,
[4410.64 --> 4411.06]  we often
[4411.06 --> 4412.28]  think of
[4412.28 --> 4412.84]  soft,
[4413.02 --> 4413.64]  something like
[4413.64 --> 4414.72]  toilet tissue.
[4415.54 --> 4416.96]  That's not
[4416.96 --> 4417.42]  the way we
[4417.42 --> 4418.04]  like to think
[4418.04 --> 4418.56]  of Jesus.
[4418.74 --> 4419.06]  The word
[4419.06 --> 4420.32]  here is
[4420.32 --> 4420.66]  also
[4420.66 --> 4421.30]  translated
[4421.30 --> 4422.10]  meek.
[4423.14 --> 4424.08]  And meek
[4424.08 --> 4424.58]  does not
[4424.58 --> 4424.94]  mean
[4424.94 --> 4425.90]  weak.
[4427.54 --> 4428.12]  Moses
[4428.12 --> 4428.98]  is also
[4428.98 --> 4429.70]  described
[4429.70 --> 4430.94]  that time
[4430.94 --> 4431.36]  as the
[4431.36 --> 4431.86]  meekest
[4431.86 --> 4432.40]  man
[4432.40 --> 4433.28]  on the
[4433.28 --> 4433.62]  earth.
[4434.82 --> 4435.26]  And as
[4435.26 --> 4435.54]  you know,
[4435.60 --> 4436.16]  Moses was
[4436.16 --> 4436.82]  no pushover.
[4438.40 --> 4439.60]  In Jesus,
[4439.86 --> 4440.46]  we see
[4440.46 --> 4441.66]  the meekest
[4441.66 --> 4442.96]  of all
[4442.96 --> 4444.00]  servants.
[4445.62 --> 4446.58]  And he's
[4446.58 --> 4447.16]  revealing
[4447.16 --> 4448.58]  the tender
[4448.58 --> 4449.46]  heart
[4449.46 --> 4450.72]  of God
[4450.72 --> 4451.36]  who
[4451.36 --> 4452.46]  identifies
[4452.46 --> 4453.94]  particularly
[4453.94 --> 4455.10]  with those
[4455.10 --> 4455.88]  who are
[4455.88 --> 4456.44]  weary
[4456.44 --> 4458.84]  and burdened.
[4460.40 --> 4461.34]  It took
[4461.34 --> 4462.30]  an incredible
[4462.30 --> 4463.32]  amount of
[4463.32 --> 4464.12]  meekness
[4464.12 --> 4464.80]  for Jesus
[4464.80 --> 4465.68]  to humble
[4465.68 --> 4466.78]  himself
[4466.78 --> 4467.98]  and serve
[4467.98 --> 4468.66]  others
[4468.66 --> 4470.18]  as he so
[4470.18 --> 4471.26]  consistently
[4471.26 --> 4471.94]  did
[4471.94 --> 4473.04]  even to
[4473.04 --> 4473.52]  those
[4473.52 --> 4474.46]  who he
[4474.46 --> 4474.90]  knew would
[4474.90 --> 4475.62]  betray him.
[4475.62 --> 4479.30]  here we
[4479.30 --> 4479.90]  see the
[4479.90 --> 4480.36]  heart of
[4480.36 --> 4480.86]  God.
[4481.86 --> 4482.48]  In Jesus
[4482.48 --> 4483.20]  we see
[4483.20 --> 4484.20]  as the
[4484.20 --> 4484.52]  scriptures
[4484.52 --> 4484.98]  say,
[4485.10 --> 4485.72]  how high
[4485.72 --> 4486.54]  and why
[4486.54 --> 4487.40]  and long
[4487.40 --> 4488.24]  and deep
[4488.24 --> 4489.66]  is the
[4489.66 --> 4490.08]  love
[4490.08 --> 4491.26]  of God.
[4493.04 --> 4493.66]  And so
[4493.66 --> 4494.96]  the first
[4494.96 --> 4495.88]  call
[4495.88 --> 4496.96]  of God
[4496.96 --> 4497.40]  on our
[4497.40 --> 4497.84]  heart
[4497.84 --> 4499.12]  is not
[4499.12 --> 4499.70]  to a
[4499.70 --> 4500.46]  task
[4500.46 --> 4501.52]  but to
[4501.52 --> 4502.32]  a person
[4502.32 --> 4504.54]  to
[4504.54 --> 4505.10]  himself.
[4507.14 --> 4507.40]  Os
[4507.40 --> 4507.86]  Guinness
[4507.86 --> 4508.30]  has written
[4508.30 --> 4509.00]  a wonderful
[4509.00 --> 4509.80]  book called
[4509.80 --> 4510.68]  The Call
[4510.68 --> 4512.44]  and in it
[4512.44 --> 4512.94]  he says
[4512.94 --> 4513.36]  we are
[4513.36 --> 4515.46]  not
[4515.46 --> 4516.44]  primarily
[4516.44 --> 4517.32]  called
[4517.32 --> 4518.04]  to do
[4518.04 --> 4518.66]  something
[4518.66 --> 4519.62]  or go
[4519.62 --> 4520.26]  somewhere
[4520.26 --> 4521.48]  we are
[4521.48 --> 4522.34]  called
[4522.34 --> 4523.12]  to
[4523.12 --> 4523.74]  someone.
[4525.34 --> 4526.12]  We are
[4526.12 --> 4527.02]  not called
[4527.02 --> 4527.84]  first to
[4527.84 --> 4529.06]  special work
[4529.06 --> 4530.28]  but to
[4530.28 --> 4530.74]  God.
[4533.92 --> 4534.76]  Jesus
[4534.76 --> 4535.64]  is this
[4535.64 --> 4536.00]  God.
[4537.64 --> 4538.28]  And like
[4538.28 --> 4539.06]  Augustine
[4539.06 --> 4539.90]  said
[4539.90 --> 4540.96]  our hearts
[4540.96 --> 4541.72]  will remain
[4541.72 --> 4542.24]  restless
[4542.24 --> 4543.82]  until we
[4543.82 --> 4544.40]  find our
[4544.40 --> 4545.06]  rest
[4545.06 --> 4546.40]  in him.
[4548.08 --> 4548.66]  And when
[4548.66 --> 4549.36]  we believe
[4549.36 --> 4549.76]  and are
[4549.76 --> 4550.52]  embraced
[4550.52 --> 4551.36]  by our
[4551.36 --> 4551.84]  Lord
[4551.84 --> 4553.14]  then
[4553.14 --> 4554.12]  Jesus
[4554.12 --> 4555.18]  gives us
[4555.18 --> 4556.02]  something
[4556.02 --> 4557.22]  to do.
[4559.06 --> 4560.06]  a place
[4560.06 --> 4560.48]  to go
[4560.48 --> 4561.10]  perhaps.
[4564.12 --> 4565.16]  You think
[4565.16 --> 4565.82]  as some
[4565.82 --> 4566.36]  I think
[4566.36 --> 4566.74]  do
[4566.74 --> 4567.50]  that Jesus
[4567.50 --> 4567.88]  you know
[4567.88 --> 4568.32]  you come
[4568.32 --> 4568.70]  to him
[4568.70 --> 4568.94]  and he
[4568.94 --> 4569.38]  provide
[4569.38 --> 4569.76]  rest
[4569.76 --> 4570.18]  it sounds
[4570.18 --> 4570.52]  a little
[4570.52 --> 4571.26]  boring.
[4572.10 --> 4572.74]  There's
[4572.74 --> 4573.14]  nobody
[4573.14 --> 4573.64]  unemployed
[4573.64 --> 4574.24]  in his
[4574.24 --> 4574.62]  kingdom.
[4576.16 --> 4576.44]  Jesus
[4576.44 --> 4577.08]  has not
[4577.08 --> 4577.50]  just a
[4577.50 --> 4577.76]  heart
[4577.76 --> 4578.40]  for us
[4578.40 --> 4579.30]  he has
[4579.30 --> 4580.30]  a task
[4580.30 --> 4581.02]  for us
[4581.02 --> 4582.38]  a yoke.
[4583.84 --> 4584.08]  Now
[4584.08 --> 4584.36]  Jesus
[4584.36 --> 4585.34]  we believe
[4585.34 --> 4585.70]  was a
[4585.70 --> 4586.32]  carpenter
[4586.32 --> 4586.98]  he was
[4586.98 --> 4587.36]  familiar
[4587.36 --> 4587.98]  with
[4587.98 --> 4588.98]  yokes
[4588.98 --> 4590.20]  they made
[4590.20 --> 4590.56]  them in
[4590.56 --> 4591.00]  such a
[4591.00 --> 4591.16]  way
[4591.16 --> 4591.60]  that like
[4591.60 --> 4592.16]  a tailored
[4592.16 --> 4592.72]  suit
[4592.72 --> 4593.48]  they
[4593.48 --> 4594.28]  exactly
[4594.28 --> 4595.32]  fit
[4595.32 --> 4596.46]  and when
[4596.46 --> 4596.86]  you put
[4596.86 --> 4597.40]  the yoke
[4597.40 --> 4597.78]  on
[4597.78 --> 4598.40]  there was
[4598.40 --> 4598.90]  absolutely
[4598.90 --> 4599.78]  no pain
[4599.78 --> 4600.40]  and you
[4600.40 --> 4601.22]  could carry
[4601.22 --> 4602.38]  the load.
[4603.40 --> 4603.68]  You might
[4603.68 --> 4604.24]  say yokes
[4604.24 --> 4604.72]  were made
[4604.72 --> 4605.14]  like a
[4605.14 --> 4605.42]  dentist
[4605.42 --> 4606.20]  shapes
[4606.20 --> 4606.78]  a bridge
[4606.78 --> 4607.56]  or a
[4607.56 --> 4607.92]  mold.
[4609.62 --> 4610.38]  Fits it
[4610.38 --> 4610.98]  so well
[4610.98 --> 4611.48]  that there's
[4611.48 --> 4612.36]  no irritation
[4612.36 --> 4612.80]  and you
[4612.80 --> 4613.24]  can chew
[4613.24 --> 4613.60]  hard.
[4615.92 --> 4616.28]  You see
[4616.28 --> 4617.00]  God does
[4617.00 --> 4617.68]  lay on
[4617.68 --> 4618.16]  each one
[4618.16 --> 4618.72]  of us
[4618.72 --> 4619.60]  a burden
[4619.60 --> 4622.22]  like the
[4622.22 --> 4622.56]  burden
[4622.56 --> 4623.42]  he had
[4623.42 --> 4623.80]  when he
[4623.80 --> 4624.42]  looked down
[4624.42 --> 4624.80]  at the
[4624.80 --> 4625.38]  world
[4625.38 --> 4627.14]  in love
[4627.14 --> 4629.38]  and as
[4629.38 --> 4629.88]  the Lord
[4629.88 --> 4630.88]  softens
[4630.88 --> 4631.56]  and
[4631.56 --> 4632.88]  strengthens
[4632.88 --> 4634.46]  our hearts
[4634.46 --> 4635.34]  through his
[4635.34 --> 4635.78]  love
[4635.78 --> 4637.02]  for us
[4637.02 --> 4637.68]  then we
[4637.68 --> 4638.00]  too
[4638.00 --> 4638.88]  begin to
[4638.88 --> 4639.28]  see
[4639.28 --> 4640.62]  needs
[4640.62 --> 4641.24]  something
[4641.24 --> 4642.00]  stirs
[4642.00 --> 4642.44]  in us
[4642.44 --> 4642.76]  there's
[4642.76 --> 4643.18]  perhaps
[4643.18 --> 4644.06]  a holy
[4644.06 --> 4645.32]  discontent
[4645.32 --> 4646.42]  that urges
[4646.42 --> 4646.98]  us
[4646.98 --> 4649.34]  that can
[4649.34 --> 4649.94]  often be
[4649.94 --> 4650.68]  the basis
[4650.68 --> 4652.02]  of God's
[4652.02 --> 4652.96]  calling us
[4652.96 --> 4653.84]  to pick up
[4653.84 --> 4654.84]  the yoke
[4654.84 --> 4656.94]  it may be
[4656.94 --> 4658.22]  an internal
[4658.22 --> 4659.10]  invitation
[4659.10 --> 4659.88]  you know
[4659.88 --> 4660.90]  to you see
[4660.90 --> 4661.50]  suffering
[4661.50 --> 4662.42]  you feel
[4662.42 --> 4663.22]  called to
[4663.22 --> 4663.92]  respond
[4663.92 --> 4665.50]  you know
[4665.50 --> 4666.44]  you see a
[4666.44 --> 4666.98]  hurt that
[4666.98 --> 4667.90]  needs healing
[4667.90 --> 4669.44]  a problem
[4669.44 --> 4669.94]  that needs
[4669.94 --> 4670.68]  a solution
[4670.68 --> 4675.08]  what discourages
[4675.08 --> 4675.64]  people
[4675.64 --> 4676.36]  often the
[4676.36 --> 4676.82]  most
[4676.82 --> 4677.72]  is the
[4677.72 --> 4678.32]  very thing
[4678.32 --> 4678.82]  that God
[4678.82 --> 4679.28]  might be
[4679.28 --> 4679.68]  wanting
[4679.68 --> 4680.24]  them to
[4680.24 --> 4680.58]  do
[4680.58 --> 4683.44]  bring these
[4683.44 --> 4684.06]  matters to
[4684.06 --> 4684.56]  Christ
[4684.56 --> 4687.24]  or take
[4687.24 --> 4687.90]  these things
[4687.90 --> 4688.58]  and invite
[4688.58 --> 4689.22]  Christ
[4689.22 --> 4690.30]  into them
[4690.30 --> 4693.48]  whether it's
[4693.48 --> 4694.20]  even a dark
[4694.20 --> 4694.80]  space
[4694.80 --> 4695.40]  a place
[4695.40 --> 4696.40]  of desolation
[4696.40 --> 4698.28]  invite Christ
[4698.28 --> 4698.92]  into them
[4698.92 --> 4699.74]  but be
[4699.74 --> 4700.14]  careful
[4700.14 --> 4701.34]  as he
[4701.34 --> 4701.66]  brings
[4701.66 --> 4702.24]  comfort
[4702.24 --> 4703.78]  he sometimes
[4703.78 --> 4704.50]  takes us
[4704.50 --> 4705.02]  out of our
[4705.02 --> 4705.76]  comfort zone
[4705.76 --> 4706.88]  and gets
[4706.88 --> 4707.52]  us going
[4707.52 --> 4709.36]  to help
[4709.36 --> 4709.86]  others
[4709.86 --> 4712.92]  is there
[4712.92 --> 4713.46]  a yoke
[4713.46 --> 4714.84]  that the
[4714.84 --> 4715.26]  Lord is
[4715.26 --> 4715.82]  asking you
[4715.82 --> 4716.40]  to carry
[4716.40 --> 4717.08]  at this
[4717.08 --> 4717.44]  time
[4717.44 --> 4721.20]  you will
[4721.20 --> 4721.94]  in part
[4721.94 --> 4722.24]  know
[4722.24 --> 4723.00]  the task
[4723.00 --> 4723.52]  is one
[4723.52 --> 4724.44]  from Jesus
[4724.44 --> 4726.54]  because when
[4726.54 --> 4727.04]  you wear
[4727.04 --> 4727.34]  it
[4727.34 --> 4728.20]  it won't
[4728.20 --> 4728.68]  wear you
[4728.68 --> 4729.04]  out
[4729.04 --> 4731.82]  or we
[4731.82 --> 4732.24]  can get
[4732.24 --> 4732.70]  tired
[4732.70 --> 4735.24]  the
[4735.24 --> 4736.02]  fulfilling
[4736.02 --> 4736.94]  kind
[4736.94 --> 4738.22]  of tiredness
[4738.22 --> 4738.88]  that comes
[4738.88 --> 4739.76]  from a
[4739.76 --> 4740.24]  really good
[4740.24 --> 4741.00]  day's work
[4741.00 --> 4742.72]  but not
[4742.72 --> 4743.12]  this
[4743.12 --> 4744.40]  frustrating
[4744.40 --> 4745.42]  weariness
[4745.42 --> 4746.58]  that makes
[4746.58 --> 4747.02]  you want
[4747.02 --> 4747.46]  to throw
[4747.46 --> 4747.82]  in the
[4747.82 --> 4748.20]  towel
[4748.20 --> 4749.36]  and quit
[4749.36 --> 4752.52]  some
[4752.52 --> 4753.06]  burdens
[4753.06 --> 4754.26]  are meant
[4754.26 --> 4754.88]  to be
[4754.88 --> 4755.36]  carried
[4755.36 --> 4756.54]  and some
[4756.54 --> 4758.10]  are not
[4758.10 --> 4759.78]  is what
[4759.78 --> 4760.30]  you are
[4760.30 --> 4760.82]  carrying
[4760.82 --> 4761.80]  right now
[4761.80 --> 4762.30]  something
[4762.30 --> 4763.56]  that you
[4763.56 --> 4764.18]  have picked
[4764.18 --> 4764.56]  up
[4764.56 --> 4765.92]  or that
[4765.92 --> 4766.50]  the Lord
[4766.50 --> 4767.70]  has given
[4767.70 --> 4768.30]  to you
[4768.30 --> 4769.30]  his yoke
[4769.30 --> 4772.30]  Jesus did
[4772.30 --> 4773.12]  ask us
[4773.12 --> 4774.12]  to take
[4774.12 --> 4774.66]  up our
[4774.66 --> 4775.26]  cross
[4775.26 --> 4775.88]  but he's
[4775.88 --> 4776.62]  never asked
[4776.62 --> 4777.30]  us to pick
[4777.30 --> 4777.84]  up one
[4777.84 --> 4778.82]  we can't
[4778.82 --> 4779.22]  carry
[4779.22 --> 4783.48]  here are
[4783.48 --> 4783.68]  some
[4783.68 --> 4784.20]  questions
[4784.20 --> 4784.92]  and then
[4784.92 --> 4785.44]  we'll end
[4785.44 --> 4787.36]  these questions
[4787.36 --> 4787.92]  may help
[4787.92 --> 4788.64]  you as you
[4788.64 --> 4789.72]  seek to
[4789.72 --> 4790.60]  discern as
[4790.60 --> 4791.38]  sometimes we
[4791.38 --> 4792.22]  do God's
[4792.22 --> 4793.10]  will in
[4793.10 --> 4793.52]  life
[4793.52 --> 4795.80]  is the
[4795.80 --> 4796.34]  prompting
[4796.34 --> 4796.98]  from God
[4796.98 --> 4799.52]  is it in
[4799.52 --> 4800.08]  line with
[4800.08 --> 4800.64]  the scriptures
[4800.64 --> 4803.62]  does this
[4803.62 --> 4804.20]  thought or
[4804.20 --> 4805.02]  action on
[4805.02 --> 4805.54]  your mind
[4805.54 --> 4805.90]  does it
[4805.90 --> 4806.32]  bring it
[4806.32 --> 4807.02]  bring you
[4807.02 --> 4808.82]  in closer
[4808.82 --> 4809.58]  personal
[4809.58 --> 4810.54]  relationship
[4810.54 --> 4811.34]  with God
[4811.34 --> 4813.48]  will it
[4813.48 --> 4814.02]  benefit
[4814.02 --> 4815.36]  others
[4815.36 --> 4816.28]  and in
[4816.28 --> 4816.64]  that way
[4816.64 --> 4817.16]  build up
[4817.16 --> 4817.78]  the kingdom
[4817.78 --> 4819.20]  does it
[4819.20 --> 4819.76]  fit
[4819.76 --> 4821.02]  with who
[4821.02 --> 4821.70]  God made
[4821.70 --> 4822.04]  you to
[4822.04 --> 4822.38]  be
[4822.38 --> 4825.14]  might
[4825.14 --> 4826.00]  it be
[4826.00 --> 4826.70]  triggering
[4826.70 --> 4828.44]  a weakness
[4828.44 --> 4829.54]  in me
[4829.54 --> 4830.60]  in you
[4830.60 --> 4833.00]  the tendency
[4833.00 --> 4833.66]  of the
[4833.66 --> 4834.14]  flesh
[4834.14 --> 4836.86]  what do
[4836.86 --> 4837.46]  godly
[4837.46 --> 4838.10]  people
[4838.10 --> 4840.24]  who I
[4840.24 --> 4841.10]  trust
[4841.10 --> 4842.50]  think about
[4842.50 --> 4842.80]  it
[4842.80 --> 4845.14]  and will
[4845.14 --> 4845.70]  it bring
[4845.70 --> 4846.36]  peace
[4846.36 --> 4846.92]  does it
[4846.92 --> 4847.72]  bring peace
[4847.72 --> 4848.22]  and a
[4848.22 --> 4848.54]  deeper
[4848.54 --> 4849.20]  sense
[4849.20 --> 4850.62]  of joy
[4850.62 --> 4852.66]  such
[4852.66 --> 4853.20]  questions
[4853.20 --> 4853.64]  may be
[4853.64 --> 4854.12]  of help
[4854.12 --> 4857.22]  so let
[4857.22 --> 4857.56]  me end
[4857.56 --> 4858.12]  by reading
[4858.12 --> 4858.76]  the passage
[4858.76 --> 4859.24]  again
[4859.24 --> 4859.68]  out of
[4859.68 --> 4860.30]  the message
[4860.30 --> 4862.34]  and to
[4862.34 --> 4862.70]  read it
[4862.70 --> 4863.04]  as the
[4863.04 --> 4863.52]  call of
[4863.52 --> 4863.86]  God
[4863.86 --> 4864.36]  on our
[4864.36 --> 4864.74]  life
[4864.74 --> 4865.46]  a call
[4865.46 --> 4866.86]  that does
[4866.86 --> 4867.94]  not go
[4867.94 --> 4868.68]  away
[4868.68 --> 4870.00]  with age
[4870.00 --> 4873.10]  we are
[4873.10 --> 4873.82]  always
[4873.82 --> 4875.66]  as long
[4875.66 --> 4875.94]  as we
[4875.94 --> 4876.56]  have breath
[4876.56 --> 4877.80]  to have
[4877.80 --> 4878.52]  an ear
[4878.52 --> 4879.64]  for what
[4879.64 --> 4880.08]  Jesus
[4880.08 --> 4881.72]  is saying
[4881.72 --> 4882.90]  as he's
[4882.90 --> 4883.38]  always
[4883.38 --> 4883.94]  welcoming
[4883.94 --> 4884.44]  us
[4884.44 --> 4885.46]  with open
[4885.46 --> 4886.00]  arms
[4886.00 --> 4889.04]  are you
[4889.04 --> 4889.50]  tired
[4889.50 --> 4891.66]  worn
[4891.66 --> 4892.06]  out
[4892.06 --> 4894.96]  burnout
[4894.96 --> 4895.86]  on religion
[4895.86 --> 4898.82]  come to
[4898.82 --> 4899.10]  me
[4899.10 --> 4901.92]  get away
[4901.92 --> 4902.58]  with me
[4902.58 --> 4903.94]  and you'll
[4903.94 --> 4904.48]  recover
[4904.48 --> 4905.46]  your life
[4905.46 --> 4907.28]  I'll show
[4907.28 --> 4907.78]  you how to
[4907.78 --> 4908.40]  take a real
[4908.40 --> 4909.04]  rest
[4909.04 --> 4910.66]  walk with
[4910.66 --> 4910.96]  me
[4910.96 --> 4912.24]  and work
[4912.24 --> 4913.06]  with me
[4913.06 --> 4914.54]  watch
[4914.54 --> 4915.60]  how I
[4915.60 --> 4916.12]  do it
[4916.12 --> 4917.72]  learn the
[4917.72 --> 4919.08]  unforced
[4919.08 --> 4919.66]  rhythms
[4919.66 --> 4920.62]  of grace
[4920.62 --> 4922.66]  I won't
[4922.66 --> 4923.38]  lay anything
[4923.38 --> 4924.04]  heavy or
[4924.04 --> 4924.58]  ill-fitting
[4924.58 --> 4925.36]  on you
[4925.36 --> 4927.20]  keep
[4927.20 --> 4927.74]  company
[4927.74 --> 4928.42]  with me
[4928.42 --> 4930.06]  and you'll
[4930.06 --> 4930.72]  learn to
[4930.72 --> 4931.54]  live freely
[4931.54 --> 4933.14]  and lightly
[4933.14 --> 4935.56]  let's pray
[4935.56 --> 4938.72]  Lord Jesus
[4938.72 --> 4939.46]  we do
[4939.46 --> 4940.26]  confess
[4940.26 --> 4941.00]  that in
[4941.00 --> 4941.54]  our
[4941.54 --> 4942.48]  pride
[4942.48 --> 4943.02]  and
[4943.02 --> 4944.22]  self
[4944.22 --> 4945.04]  determination
[4945.04 --> 4946.30]  we have
[4946.30 --> 4946.70]  often
[4946.70 --> 4947.32]  avoided
[4947.32 --> 4947.74]  you
[4947.74 --> 4950.44]  and
[4950.44 --> 4951.50]  we've
[4951.50 --> 4952.10]  created
[4952.10 --> 4953.70]  not only
[4953.70 --> 4954.90]  stress
[4954.90 --> 4955.64]  and distress
[4955.64 --> 4957.02]  in our
[4957.02 --> 4957.50]  life
[4957.50 --> 4959.12]  but in
[4959.12 --> 4959.76]  the lives
[4959.76 --> 4960.76]  of others
[4960.76 --> 4963.44]  sometimes
[4963.44 --> 4964.08]  we've been
[4964.08 --> 4964.72]  impressed
[4964.72 --> 4965.92]  by the
[4965.92 --> 4966.46]  offerings
[4966.46 --> 4966.92]  of our
[4966.92 --> 4967.44]  world
[4967.44 --> 4968.22]  and pursued
[4968.22 --> 4968.76]  our own
[4968.76 --> 4969.50]  plans
[4969.50 --> 4972.56]  help us
[4972.56 --> 4972.90]  Jesus
[4972.90 --> 4973.32]  to be

[5309.08 --> 5311.40]  Please join me in our community prayer.
[5315.24 --> 5322.82]  Father, we approach your throne on behalf of the mothers whom you have entrusted with the care of your most precious little ones.
[5323.42 --> 5328.80]  We thank you for creating each mother with a unique combination of gifts and talents.
[5329.46 --> 5333.66]  We thank you for the sacrifice of self each mother gives for her children.
[5333.66 --> 5343.76]  We thank you for the gift of time mothers give for their children, whether it's stay-at-home mothers, working mothers, and mothers who have some combination of the two.
[5344.56 --> 5350.32]  We thank you for the flexibility of mothers, for their tirelessness, their perseverance, and their devotion.
[5351.62 --> 5353.66]  We pray you give each mother strength.
[5354.46 --> 5360.62]  Help her to see in every mundane task the eternal significance that you place on mothership.
[5360.62 --> 5368.98]  Help her to understand that the most radical, world-changing events may be happening anonymously in her home.
[5370.28 --> 5373.40]  Help her to forgive those who undermine her significance.
[5374.68 --> 5380.42]  We especially pray for single mothers who must act as both mother and father in their homes.
[5381.14 --> 5386.58]  We thank you that your big arms surround children who may never know their earthly father.
[5386.58 --> 5397.60]  We also pray for mothers who never had the honor of bearing children, but whose nurturing extends to the many poor and needy who cross the threshold of their lives.
[5398.34 --> 5401.68]  We ask you to be the daily bread of tired mothers.
[5402.32 --> 5404.62]  We ask you to be their living water.
[5405.48 --> 5408.92]  We ask you to be their source of spiritual and physical strength.
[5408.92 --> 5417.74]  We pray that the same grace that flowed from father to son to us in salvation will flow from others to their children.
[5418.80 --> 5424.78]  We pray that each mother rejects perfectionism and instead embraces the goodness of the gospel.
[5425.66 --> 5429.12]  We pray the rhythms of repentance and forgiveness shape every home.
[5429.12 --> 5437.98]  Lord, give each mother a worshipful remembrance of you, the creator and sustainer of life.
[5438.90 --> 5442.86]  Help each mother to rest in the knowledge that they are about stewards of your children
[5442.86 --> 5448.52]  and that only your spirit can produce change into the hearts of each boy and girl.
[5449.50 --> 5451.62]  May each mother find rest in you.
[5451.62 --> 5459.92]  Most of all, Lord, on this day in which we honor mothers, may we love and cherish the special women who have borne us,
[5460.30 --> 5464.00]  who have nurtured us, and who have prayed for our well-being.
[5464.72 --> 5470.50]  May our hearts overflow with gratitude to you who formed and knitted each of us in a mother's womb.
[5470.50 --> 5500.48]  May our hearts salute to you, Lord, on this day in thearus age, and Toyself.
[5500.48 --> 5501.72]  through these difficult times.
[5503.16 --> 5505.80]  We also pray, Lord, that you be with Pastor Jason
[5505.80 --> 5507.56]  on his trip to the Middle East.
[5508.30 --> 5508.90]  Keep him safe.
[5509.90 --> 5512.94]  Open his senses as he walks a land steeped in history
[5512.94 --> 5514.82]  and the story of your salvation.
[5515.82 --> 5517.68]  May the insights he receives there
[5517.68 --> 5519.58]  help him in his ministry here.
[5521.02 --> 5525.42]  All this we pray ever and only in Jesus' name.
[5525.42 --> 5526.08]  Amen.
[5530.48 --> 5549.26]  We worshiped in a church the other day
[5549.26 --> 5554.32]  and they had a minute of silence at the end of the service.
[5555.24 --> 5557.04]  Now, I'd never done that before.
[5557.16 --> 5557.88]  I don't remember.
[5557.88 --> 5561.82]  We usually did it at the beginning to get our hearts going.
[5563.18 --> 5564.22]  Let's take a minute.
[5564.68 --> 5568.10]  I'll call you and invite you to stand for the blessing.
[5568.84 --> 5571.14]  Perhaps God has laid something on your heart.
[5572.44 --> 5575.00]  Let's be quiet before him for just a little while
[5575.00 --> 5576.58]  and then I'll call you.
[5576.58 --> 5576.70]  Amen.
[5587.88 --> 5591.60]  Amen.
[5591.60 --> 5593.54]  Amen.

[5596.62 --> 5596.94]  Amen.
[5597.02 --> 5598.54]  Amen.
[5598.54 --> 5627.26]  Would you please rise?
[5628.54 --> 5630.44]  It's been good to worship with you.
[5633.40 --> 5640.86]  God has been with us, and he goes with us, and his desire is to truly bless you.
[5641.20 --> 5642.38]  So go in his strength.
[5642.92 --> 5644.26]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5644.86 --> 5648.02]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5648.02 --> 5654.00]  The Lord turn his face right in your direction and give you his power and grace now and always,
[5654.44 --> 5657.06]  to which we God's people say, Amen.
[5658.54 --> 5667.58]  Amen.
[5668.04 --> 5668.32]  Amen.
[5668.32 --> 5671.26]  Amen.
[5671.26 --> 5682.98]  The salvation belongs to our God
[5682.98 --> 5688.14]  Who sits upon the throne
[5688.14 --> 5694.36]  And unto heaven
