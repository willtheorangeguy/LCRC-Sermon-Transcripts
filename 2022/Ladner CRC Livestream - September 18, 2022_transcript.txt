[0.00 --> 0.80]  Thank you
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 209.98]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 239.98]  Thank you.
[240.00 --> 269.98]  Thank you.
[269.98 --> 271.98]  Thank you.
[299.98 --> 301.98]  Thank you.
[329.98 --> 331.98]  Thank you.
[359.98 --> 361.98]  Thank you.
[389.98 --> 391.98]  Thank you.
[419.98 --> 421.98]  Thank you.
[449.98 --> 451.98]  Thank you.
[451.98 --> 453.98]  Thank you.
[481.98 --> 483.98]  Thank you.
[511.98 --> 513.98]  Thank you.
[541.98 --> 571.98] 
[571.98 --> 601.98] 
[601.98 --> 631.98] 
[631.98 --> 633.98]  Thank you.
[633.98 --> 635.98]  Thank you.
[635.98 --> 637.98]  Thank you.
[637.98 --> 639.98]  Thank you.
[639.98 --> 641.98]  Thank you.
[641.98 --> 643.98]  Thank you.
[643.98 --> 645.98]  Thank you.
[645.98 --> 647.98]  Thank you.
[647.98 --> 649.98]  Thank you.
[649.98 --> 651.98]  Thank you.
[651.98 --> 653.98]  And you,
[653.98 --> 655.98]  the double arrow.
[655.98 --> 657.98]  Thank you.
[657.98 --> 659.98]  So,
[659.98 --> 661.98]  and you,
[661.98 --> 663.98]  thank you,
[663.98 --> 664.88]  and I know-
[664.88 --> 665.98]  I know,
[665.98 --> 667.98]  and you,
[667.98 --> 668.06]  and you,
[668.06 --> 669.98]  and we will know that,
[669.98 --> 671.86]  the rest of the square with us,
[671.86 --> 673.98]  and let you know in the face of Israel.
[673.98 --> 675.98]  this is the Trinity story about this, or the earth.
[675.98 --> 679.04]  revealed his righteousness to the nations.
[679.90 --> 683.90]  He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel.
[684.76 --> 689.32]  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[690.60 --> 693.94]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[694.50 --> 698.22]  Burst into joyous song and sing praises.
[698.76 --> 702.50]  Now would you please bow with me before our God in prayer.
[702.50 --> 707.98]  Father, we come before you in humility,
[709.04 --> 711.90]  acknowledging that our current experience of our lives
[711.90 --> 715.72]  is just a moment in the grand story of your redemption
[715.72 --> 719.80]  and your faithfulness to your people throughout all generations.
[721.06 --> 723.42]  Lord, we acknowledge that we have always,
[723.90 --> 725.58]  that you have always been in control.
[726.04 --> 729.10]  From the moment that you brought creation into being,
[729.50 --> 731.22]  bringing order out of chaos,
[731.22 --> 733.92]  bringing something out of nothing,
[734.72 --> 737.18]  and then making us and breathing into us
[737.18 --> 739.36]  your breath of life, your spirit.
[740.70 --> 744.60]  Truly it is in you that we live and move and have our being.
[745.68 --> 748.12]  And we acknowledge, Lord, that this world, though,
[748.18 --> 749.82]  is not as it should be.
[750.66 --> 754.50]  Yet you have never ceased to continue to work out your plan
[754.50 --> 758.20]  for the salvation and the redemption of your world and of your people.
[758.92 --> 760.86]  All those who place their trust in you.
[761.94 --> 763.50]  And so we come to you this morning
[763.50 --> 768.40]  asking that you would remind us of these things
[768.40 --> 772.58]  so that our hearts would rejoice at who you are
[772.58 --> 776.00]  and would sing because of the hope that we have in you
[776.00 --> 777.92]  through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[777.92 --> 781.04]  who lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit,
[781.62 --> 785.32]  one God, both now and forevermore.
[785.98 --> 786.46]  Amen.
[787.74 --> 791.06]  Brothers and sisters, I invite you now to rise in body or in spirit
[791.06 --> 793.00]  as you are able for God's greeting.
[793.68 --> 797.08]  It comes from Psalm 145, verse 9.
[797.08 --> 799.18]  It says,
[799.34 --> 801.26]  The Lord is good to all,
[801.98 --> 805.72]  and his mercy is over all that he has made.
[806.80 --> 810.24]  As the Lord has called us and has greeted us,
[810.64 --> 813.10]  he also calls us into a community,
[813.28 --> 814.52]  the church, the body of Christ.
[814.74 --> 816.50]  So let's turn and let's greet one another now
[816.50 --> 817.74]  as God has greeted us.
[817.74 --> 817.82]  Amen.
[827.08 --> 831.56]  Amen.
[853.34 --> 855.12]  Amen.
[855.12 --> 857.12]  Amen.
[885.12 --> 887.12]  Amen.
[915.12 --> 917.12]  Amen.
[945.12 --> 947.12]  Amen.
[975.12 --> 977.12]  Amen.
[1005.12 --> 1007.12]  Amen.
[1035.12 --> 1037.12]  Amen.
[1065.12 --> 1067.12]  Amen.
[1095.12 --> 1097.12]  Amen.
[1125.12 --> 1127.12]  Amen.
[1127.12 --> 1129.12]  Amen.
[1129.12 --> 1131.12]  Amen.
[1131.12 --> 1133.12]  Amen.
[1133.12 --> 1135.12]  Amen.
[1135.12 --> 1137.12]  Amen.
[1137.12 --> 1139.12]  Amen.
[1139.12 --> 1141.12]  Amen.
[1141.12 --> 1143.12]  Amen.
[1143.12 --> 1145.12]  You may be seated.
[1145.12 --> 1150.12]  At this time, the children are dismissed to go to their classes.
[1150.12 --> 1155.12]  And so we are now starting back up with three classes.
[1155.12 --> 1159.12]  And so they're all through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[1159.12 --> 1164.12]  And I hope, I think we'll all maybe take a week or two to sort it out.
[1164.12 --> 1165.12]  But.
[1165.12 --> 1175.12]  All right.
[1175.12 --> 1180.12]  So here we also come now to our prayer of confession.
[1180.12 --> 1185.12]  You know, as I mentioned earlier, when we get zoomed in.
[1185.12 --> 1188.12]  And only focus on what's happening in our own lives.
[1188.12 --> 1193.12]  We also tend to believe that all the problems that we experience in our lives.
[1193.12 --> 1196.12]  Are actually just in the world out there.
[1196.12 --> 1202.12]  That there are other people doing bad things or there are things that just happen to us.
[1202.12 --> 1207.12]  But we know from scripture that while those things are also true.
[1207.12 --> 1210.12]  That we are also part of the problem.
[1210.12 --> 1211.12]  Right.
[1211.12 --> 1215.12]  That the problem is actually in our own hearts as well.
[1215.12 --> 1221.12]  And so we read in Jeremiah 17 verse 9.
[1221.12 --> 1226.12]  The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[1226.12 --> 1228.12]  Who can understand it?
[1228.12 --> 1233.12]  So God himself says that our hearts also are sick.
[1233.12 --> 1235.12]  We are all sinners.
[1235.12 --> 1240.12]  We are all part of the problem, even in the moments when we can't see how.
[1240.12 --> 1244.12]  And this is why it's so important that we have a savior.
[1244.12 --> 1251.12]  We are not Christians because we are smart enough to have chosen to follow Christ.
[1251.12 --> 1255.12]  Or because we are morally superior to those around us.
[1255.12 --> 1259.12]  No, we are Christians because we know that we sin.
[1259.12 --> 1261.12]  And that we need a savior.
[1261.12 --> 1265.12]  And so we're going to pray a prayer of confession now.
[1265.12 --> 1270.12]  And at different points in the prayer, we're going to pause.
[1270.12 --> 1276.12]  And give an opportunity to reflect silently on what we have just prayed.
[1276.12 --> 1280.12]  And confess before God the ways that we have strayed from him.
[1280.12 --> 1283.12]  So we're going to have some moments of pause in between.
[1283.12 --> 1286.12]  And it's a time I want to encourage you just to open up your hearts to God.
[1286.12 --> 1291.12]  To reflect and to turn to God for forgiveness.
[1291.12 --> 1293.12]  So let's pray together now.
[1293.12 --> 1302.12]  Gracious God, our sins are too heavy to carry.
[1302.12 --> 1305.12]  Too real to hide.
[1305.12 --> 1308.12]  And too deep to undo.
[1308.12 --> 1334.12]  Forgive what our lips tremble to name.
[1334.12 --> 1337.12]  What our hearts can no longer bear.
[1337.12 --> 1362.12]  And what has become for us a consuming fire of judgment.
[1362.12 --> 1367.12]  Set us free from a past we cannot change.
[1367.12 --> 1390.12]  Open to us a future in which we can be changed.
[1390.12 --> 1397.12]  And Father, grant to us to grow more and more in your likeness and image.
[1397.12 --> 1400.12]  Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1400.12 --> 1403.12]  Amen.
[1403.12 --> 1407.12]  And we come now to these words of assurance of pardon.
[1407.12 --> 1411.12]  And friends, this is where we most clearly see the saving work of God.
[1411.12 --> 1415.12]  In that zoomed out view that the scriptures give us.
[1415.12 --> 1419.12]  That he has done something and is continuing to do something to redeem the world.
[1419.12 --> 1422.12]  And to redeem each one of us.
[1422.12 --> 1432.12]  And while it is true that we have sinned, it is a greater truth that God offers forgiveness to all those who put their faith and trust in him.
[1432.12 --> 1435.12]  And we are seeking his grace and his pardon.
[1435.12 --> 1439.12]  And so these words come to us from 1 John chapter 2.
[1439.12 --> 1445.12]  My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.
[1445.12 --> 1454.12]  But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous one.
[1454.12 --> 1459.12]  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[1459.12 --> 1464.12]  And not only for ours, but also for the sins of the whole world.
[1464.12 --> 1466.12]  What a wonderful truth that is.
[1466.12 --> 1469.12]  So let's respond with joyous singing.
[1469.12 --> 1476.12]  I invite you to stand and let's sing our song of renewal together.
[1476.12 --> 1478.12]  There we go.
[1478.12 --> 1499.12]  There's a wideness in God's mercy.
[1499.12 --> 1504.12]  There's a wideness in God's mercy.
[1504.12 --> 1509.12]  Like the wideness of the sea.
[1509.12 --> 1514.12]  There's a kindness in God's justice.
[1514.12 --> 1519.12]  Which is more than liberty.
[1519.12 --> 1524.12]  There is no place where earth arose.
[1524.12 --> 1534.12]  There's no place where earth's failings.
[1534.12 --> 1535.12]  There's no place where earth's failings.
[1535.12 --> 1539.12]  There's such kindly judging me.
[1539.12 --> 1542.12]  There's no place where earth's failings.
[1542.12 --> 1547.12]  There's no place where earth's failings.
[1547.12 --> 1552.12]  And the love of God is water.
[1552.12 --> 1556.12]  And the love of God is water.
[1556.12 --> 1558.12]  And the measures of the mind.
[1558.12 --> 1563.12]  And the heart of the eternal.
[1563.12 --> 1567.12]  Is most wonderfully poured.
[1567.12 --> 1571.86]  Make our love for the more faithful
[1571.86 --> 1577.80]  Let us take you back to work
[1577.80 --> 1583.20]  And our lives will be thanksgiving
[1583.20 --> 1589.68]  For the goodness of the Lord
[1597.12 --> 1616.72]  Our reading this morning is from Ephesians 4, verses 17 to 24,
[1617.40 --> 1621.84]  and it can be found on page 871 in your Bible.
[1623.92 --> 1625.80]  Living as children of light,
[1625.80 --> 1631.18]  so I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord,
[1631.68 --> 1635.06]  that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do
[1635.06 --> 1637.32]  in the futility of their thinking.
[1638.14 --> 1640.66]  They are darkened in their understanding
[1640.66 --> 1643.14]  and separated from the life of God
[1643.14 --> 1645.94]  because of the ignorance that is in them
[1645.94 --> 1648.40]  due to the hardening of their hearts.
[1649.36 --> 1651.32]  Having lost all sensitivity,
[1652.06 --> 1654.76]  they have given themselves over to sensuality
[1654.76 --> 1658.56]  so as to indulge in every kind of impurity
[1658.56 --> 1661.60]  with a continual lust for more.
[1662.64 --> 1665.02]  You, however, did not know,
[1665.72 --> 1668.84]  did not come to know Christ that way.
[1670.06 --> 1671.28]  Surely you heard of him
[1671.28 --> 1672.52]  and were taught in him
[1672.52 --> 1675.06]  in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
[1675.06 --> 1679.58]  You were taught with regard to your former way of life
[1679.58 --> 1682.34]  to put off your old self,
[1682.66 --> 1687.08]  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires,
[1687.90 --> 1692.06]  to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[1692.44 --> 1694.58]  and to put on the new self,
[1695.24 --> 1696.78]  created to be like God
[1696.78 --> 1699.78]  in true righteousness and holiness.
[1699.78 --> 1702.54]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1702.54 --> 1704.54]  Thanks be to God.
[1704.54 --> 1722.34]  Let's come before the Lord in prayer.
[1722.82 --> 1723.62]  Please pray with me.
[1724.74 --> 1725.70]  Our Heavenly Father,
[1725.86 --> 1726.94]  we thank you
[1726.94 --> 1729.62]  for your word, Lord,
[1729.62 --> 1731.36]  which opens our eyes
[1731.36 --> 1733.14]  and lets us to see
[1733.14 --> 1734.40]  who you are,
[1734.78 --> 1735.70]  what you are doing
[1735.70 --> 1736.96]  in this world,
[1737.00 --> 1738.08]  and what you are willing
[1738.08 --> 1739.90]  and able to do in our own lives.
[1740.88 --> 1741.40]  So, Lord,
[1741.64 --> 1743.78]  as we open your word together this morning,
[1743.88 --> 1745.54]  would you draw us to yourself?
[1746.06 --> 1747.36]  And would you change us?
[1747.36 --> 1749.28]  And would you do your work in our hearts?
[1749.78 --> 1750.88]  Lord, to make us
[1750.88 --> 1752.20]  your disciples.
[1752.52 --> 1753.60]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1753.86 --> 1754.14]  Amen.
[1754.14 --> 1754.26]  Amen.
[1756.82 --> 1758.06]  Who has read the book
[1758.06 --> 1759.10]  The Great Divorce
[1759.10 --> 1760.02]  by C.S. Lewis?
[1761.02 --> 1762.26]  Maybe a couple.
[1762.32 --> 1762.92]  I saw a couple.
[1763.44 --> 1764.88]  I highly recommend it.
[1765.00 --> 1765.96]  It's a fun,
[1766.22 --> 1767.50]  really cool read.
[1767.80 --> 1768.78]  Well, I want to share
[1768.78 --> 1770.58]  one scene from the story.
[1772.00 --> 1772.90]  So, C.S. Lewis,
[1773.04 --> 1774.18]  one part in the book,
[1774.26 --> 1774.96]  The Great Divorce,
[1775.00 --> 1775.96]  he tells the story
[1775.96 --> 1777.04]  of a young man
[1777.04 --> 1778.44]  who is tormented
[1778.44 --> 1779.72]  by a red lizard
[1779.72 --> 1781.90]  that lives on his shoulder.
[1781.90 --> 1783.80]  And this lizard
[1783.80 --> 1785.20]  is constantly whispering
[1785.20 --> 1786.20]  in his ear
[1786.20 --> 1787.30]  and mocking him.
[1788.14 --> 1788.72]  One day,
[1788.82 --> 1790.06]  an angel comes
[1790.06 --> 1791.20]  and offers
[1791.20 --> 1793.02]  to get rid of the lizard.
[1794.08 --> 1794.58]  At first,
[1794.66 --> 1796.00]  the young man is thrilled
[1796.00 --> 1796.72]  and he thinks,
[1797.10 --> 1798.70]  I can finally get rid
[1798.70 --> 1799.42]  of this thing
[1799.42 --> 1800.84]  that is tormenting me.
[1801.80 --> 1803.02]  But then he realizes
[1803.02 --> 1804.62]  that the angel's hands
[1804.62 --> 1806.06]  begin to glow
[1806.06 --> 1807.76]  with a deadly heat.
[1808.70 --> 1809.88]  And the way the angel
[1809.88 --> 1811.84]  intends to remove the lizard
[1811.84 --> 1813.78]  is by killing it.
[1815.00 --> 1816.30]  So, here's the dialogue
[1816.30 --> 1817.44]  that takes place
[1817.44 --> 1818.10]  in the story.
[1819.02 --> 1820.10]  Oh, ow, look out!
[1820.56 --> 1821.80]  You're burning me!
[1822.60 --> 1823.26]  Keep away!
[1824.04 --> 1825.34]  said the man, retreating.
[1826.34 --> 1827.80]  Don't you want him killed?
[1828.44 --> 1829.08]  asked the angel.
[1829.64 --> 1830.84]  You didn't say anything
[1830.84 --> 1832.48]  so drastic as that.
[1833.58 --> 1835.06]  It's the only way,
[1835.60 --> 1836.18]  said the angel,
[1836.18 --> 1837.36]  whose burning hands
[1837.36 --> 1838.42]  were now very close
[1838.42 --> 1839.16]  to the lizard.
[1840.16 --> 1841.66]  Shall I kill it?
[1842.58 --> 1843.80]  Well, I mean,
[1844.00 --> 1844.90]  for the moment,
[1845.06 --> 1845.86]  I was only thinking
[1845.86 --> 1847.20]  about silencing it
[1847.20 --> 1848.72]  because it's so embarrassing.
[1849.86 --> 1851.10]  May I kill it?
[1851.72 --> 1853.02]  The angel asked again.
[1854.12 --> 1854.68]  Oh, please,
[1854.74 --> 1855.48]  really, don't bother.
[1856.12 --> 1857.02]  Look, it's gone to sleep
[1857.02 --> 1857.62]  on its own.
[1857.90 --> 1859.44]  I'm sure it'll be fine now.
[1860.72 --> 1862.00]  May I kill it?
[1862.42 --> 1863.44]  The angel asked.
[1864.40 --> 1865.08]  Oh, honestly,
[1865.32 --> 1866.16]  I don't think
[1866.16 --> 1867.10]  there's the slightest
[1867.10 --> 1868.20]  necessity for that.
[1868.54 --> 1869.98]  I'm sure I shall be able
[1869.98 --> 1871.14]  to keep it in order now.
[1871.72 --> 1873.28]  I think the gradual process
[1873.28 --> 1874.82]  would be far better
[1874.82 --> 1876.00]  than killing it.
[1877.40 --> 1878.80]  The gradual process
[1878.80 --> 1881.06]  is of no use at all.
[1882.28 --> 1882.88]  Get back!
[1882.92 --> 1883.64]  You're burning me!
[1883.80 --> 1884.96]  How can I tell you
[1884.96 --> 1885.42]  to kill it?
[1885.42 --> 1886.20]  You'll kill me
[1886.20 --> 1886.88]  if you did.
[1887.58 --> 1888.78]  It is not so,
[1889.26 --> 1889.86]  said the angel.
[1890.48 --> 1891.62]  Why, you're hurting me!
[1891.62 --> 1893.48]  I never said
[1893.48 --> 1894.62]  it wouldn't hurt you.
[1894.82 --> 1896.84]  I said it wouldn't kill you.
[1898.68 --> 1900.02]  And so that's the struggle
[1900.02 --> 1901.18]  of this young man
[1901.18 --> 1902.54]  with the lizard.
[1902.80 --> 1905.12]  It's a very vivid scene
[1905.12 --> 1905.72]  in the book.
[1906.54 --> 1907.96]  But as I read this,
[1908.68 --> 1909.24]  I wonder,
[1909.40 --> 1910.32]  and as I share it with you,
[1910.38 --> 1910.70]  I wonder,
[1910.88 --> 1911.96]  can you relate
[1911.96 --> 1913.64]  to this young man
[1913.64 --> 1914.46]  in the story?
[1915.18 --> 1916.42]  The red lizard
[1916.42 --> 1917.96]  represents the sin
[1917.96 --> 1918.80]  that each of us
[1918.80 --> 1919.94]  has in our lives.
[1920.36 --> 1920.98]  And just like
[1920.98 --> 1921.54]  the young man
[1921.54 --> 1922.18]  with the lizard,
[1922.40 --> 1923.34]  we too want
[1923.34 --> 1924.52]  to be rid of it.
[1924.94 --> 1925.62]  In a sense,
[1925.72 --> 1927.08]  we want to change.
[1927.94 --> 1928.74]  We want to get rid
[1928.74 --> 1929.26]  of this sin
[1929.26 --> 1930.42]  that is just tormenting us
[1930.42 --> 1931.34]  and mocking us.
[1931.90 --> 1932.22]  And yet,
[1932.28 --> 1933.04]  at the same time,
[1933.08 --> 1934.08]  we find all kinds
[1934.08 --> 1934.80]  of ways
[1934.80 --> 1936.08]  to justify it
[1936.08 --> 1937.70]  and to convince ourselves
[1937.70 --> 1938.26]  that the sin
[1938.26 --> 1938.88]  in our lives
[1938.88 --> 1939.66]  is really not
[1939.66 --> 1940.84]  that dangerous.
[1941.48 --> 1942.48]  It's not that big
[1942.48 --> 1943.00]  of a deal.
[1943.18 --> 1944.06]  We can handle it
[1944.06 --> 1944.78]  on our own.
[1945.30 --> 1945.88]  And anyway,
[1946.12 --> 1947.14]  it's too difficult
[1947.14 --> 1948.78]  to get rid of this thing.
[1948.82 --> 1949.52]  It's too painful
[1949.52 --> 1950.72]  to kill it.
[1952.54 --> 1953.66]  And I think,
[1953.72 --> 1954.08]  I'm sure,
[1954.20 --> 1954.70]  all of us
[1954.70 --> 1955.60]  can relate to this
[1955.60 --> 1956.36]  in one way
[1956.36 --> 1956.92]  or another
[1956.92 --> 1957.86]  because all of us
[1957.86 --> 1959.24]  have sin
[1959.24 --> 1960.10]  in our hearts.
[1961.14 --> 1962.34]  But in our passage
[1962.34 --> 1962.90]  this morning
[1962.90 --> 1963.76]  in Ephesians 4,
[1963.88 --> 1964.60]  God is saying
[1964.60 --> 1965.80]  that when Christ
[1965.80 --> 1966.86]  saves us,
[1967.30 --> 1968.60]  he calls us
[1968.60 --> 1969.26]  to himself
[1969.26 --> 1970.60]  and it is always
[1970.60 --> 1971.22]  a call
[1971.22 --> 1972.16]  to leave
[1972.16 --> 1973.32]  our life of sin
[1973.32 --> 1974.94]  and to live
[1974.94 --> 1975.90]  instead for God.
[1975.90 --> 1975.94]  God.
[1976.82 --> 1977.50]  It's a call
[1977.50 --> 1978.14]  to live
[1978.14 --> 1980.60]  a holy life.
[1981.96 --> 1982.54]  It's a call
[1982.54 --> 1982.94]  to live
[1982.94 --> 1983.56]  our lives
[1983.56 --> 1984.72]  set apart.
[1985.28 --> 1985.88]  That's what holiness
[1985.88 --> 1986.26]  means,
[1986.34 --> 1987.46]  set apart for God,
[1987.78 --> 1988.52]  coming under
[1988.52 --> 1989.26]  his reign
[1989.26 --> 1990.02]  and his rule
[1990.02 --> 1990.66]  in our lives,
[1990.98 --> 1991.96]  being completely
[1991.96 --> 1993.58]  devoted to him
[1993.58 --> 1995.92]  because of his grace
[1995.92 --> 1996.62]  and love for us.
[1997.16 --> 1998.52]  We can follow him
[1998.52 --> 1999.18]  because we know
[1999.18 --> 2000.18]  that he loves us
[2000.18 --> 2000.68]  immensely,
[2001.32 --> 2002.26]  that he is kind
[2002.26 --> 2002.90]  and good
[2002.90 --> 2004.38]  and only wants
[2004.38 --> 2004.82]  what is good
[2004.82 --> 2005.38]  for us.
[2006.26 --> 2006.66]  So now,
[2006.74 --> 2007.40]  how does this work
[2007.40 --> 2008.42]  in our own lives?
[2009.22 --> 2009.66]  And we're going
[2009.66 --> 2010.30]  to see this
[2010.30 --> 2011.08]  this morning
[2011.08 --> 2011.84]  in two parts,
[2012.46 --> 2013.46]  following the contrast
[2013.46 --> 2014.28]  that Paul lays out
[2014.28 --> 2015.88]  here in this passage.
[2016.12 --> 2016.70]  So first,
[2016.78 --> 2017.26]  we're going to look
[2017.26 --> 2017.82]  at the root
[2017.82 --> 2018.92]  of unholiness,
[2019.68 --> 2021.12]  how Paul describes
[2021.12 --> 2021.80]  the life
[2021.80 --> 2022.42]  of walking
[2022.42 --> 2023.08]  with lizards.
[2023.78 --> 2024.46]  And then we're going
[2024.46 --> 2024.90]  to see
[2024.90 --> 2026.22]  how we can live
[2026.22 --> 2027.06]  a life of holiness
[2027.06 --> 2027.72]  that God
[2027.72 --> 2028.96]  calls us to.
[2029.70 --> 2030.52]  So first,
[2030.52 --> 2033.28]  in verses 17
[2033.28 --> 2034.24]  to 19,
[2035.14 --> 2036.06]  Paul describes
[2036.06 --> 2036.82]  this life
[2036.82 --> 2037.92]  of walking
[2037.92 --> 2038.56]  with lizards.
[2038.64 --> 2039.48]  That's our first point.
[2042.88 --> 2044.00]  So here's,
[2044.22 --> 2044.74]  this is,
[2044.84 --> 2045.48]  he's describing
[2045.48 --> 2046.42]  basically here
[2046.42 --> 2047.70]  a life
[2047.70 --> 2048.96]  of alienation
[2048.96 --> 2049.86]  from God
[2049.86 --> 2050.66]  that leads
[2050.66 --> 2051.46]  further and further
[2051.46 --> 2052.84]  away from God
[2052.84 --> 2053.44]  and it leads
[2053.44 --> 2054.62]  towards sin.
[2055.00 --> 2055.52]  So let's look
[2055.52 --> 2056.18]  at this for a moment.
[2056.30 --> 2056.92]  Verse 17,
[2057.02 --> 2057.44]  it says,
[2057.86 --> 2058.92]  so I tell you this
[2058.92 --> 2060.32]  and insist on it
[2060.32 --> 2060.94]  in the Lord
[2060.94 --> 2062.16]  that you must
[2062.16 --> 2063.74]  no longer live
[2063.74 --> 2065.08]  as the Gentiles
[2065.08 --> 2066.66]  do in the futility
[2066.66 --> 2067.62]  of their thinking.
[2068.56 --> 2068.80]  Okay,
[2068.82 --> 2069.66]  so the Gentiles.
[2070.38 --> 2070.98]  Now remember,
[2071.12 --> 2071.88]  the church in Ephesus
[2071.88 --> 2072.56]  is made up
[2072.56 --> 2073.60]  of both Jews
[2073.60 --> 2075.08]  and Gentiles
[2075.08 --> 2075.54]  in it,
[2075.88 --> 2076.80]  but probably
[2076.80 --> 2077.74]  the majority
[2077.74 --> 2079.30]  of the people
[2079.30 --> 2080.28]  were Gentiles,
[2080.44 --> 2081.24]  people from
[2081.24 --> 2082.90]  all the nations
[2082.90 --> 2084.54]  of the Roman Empire
[2084.54 --> 2085.18]  of the day.
[2086.08 --> 2087.08]  And Paul says
[2087.08 --> 2088.28]  you must no longer
[2088.28 --> 2090.00]  live as the Gentiles
[2090.00 --> 2090.36]  do.
[2090.90 --> 2092.02]  Because if you remember
[2092.02 --> 2093.20]  back in chapter 2,
[2093.72 --> 2094.80]  Paul has already
[2094.80 --> 2096.26]  referred to how
[2096.26 --> 2097.16]  the Gentiles
[2097.16 --> 2098.50]  were separate
[2098.50 --> 2099.46]  from Christ,
[2100.16 --> 2100.72]  excluded
[2100.72 --> 2101.78]  from citizenship
[2101.78 --> 2102.40]  in Israel,
[2103.26 --> 2103.70]  foreigners
[2103.70 --> 2105.28]  to the covenants
[2105.28 --> 2105.98]  of the promise,
[2106.74 --> 2107.72]  without hope
[2107.72 --> 2109.00]  and without God
[2109.00 --> 2109.68]  in the world.
[2111.62 --> 2112.90]  Now think about
[2112.90 --> 2114.54]  very briefly
[2114.54 --> 2115.36]  and very broadly
[2115.36 --> 2116.00]  the history
[2116.00 --> 2117.10]  of the human race.
[2118.58 --> 2119.14]  Everyone
[2119.14 --> 2120.96]  is from the same
[2120.96 --> 2122.10]  human race,
[2122.30 --> 2123.60]  but after the fall
[2123.60 --> 2124.48]  into sin,
[2124.80 --> 2125.90]  we get this picture
[2125.90 --> 2126.84]  in the Old Testament
[2126.84 --> 2128.74]  that the whole world
[2128.74 --> 2129.92]  has just gone
[2129.92 --> 2131.32]  into idol worship
[2131.32 --> 2132.70]  and that they're
[2132.70 --> 2133.28]  just living
[2133.28 --> 2134.26]  in all kinds
[2134.26 --> 2135.22]  of immorality
[2135.22 --> 2136.52]  that they've all
[2136.52 --> 2137.52]  turned away
[2137.52 --> 2138.14]  from God.
[2139.10 --> 2139.74]  And then God
[2139.74 --> 2141.14]  decides to call
[2141.14 --> 2142.54]  one family
[2142.54 --> 2144.46]  out of the chaotic
[2144.46 --> 2145.20]  wilderness
[2145.20 --> 2146.66]  and to draw
[2146.66 --> 2148.02]  that one family
[2148.02 --> 2149.38]  into the light.
[2149.94 --> 2150.54]  It's the family
[2150.54 --> 2151.04]  of Abraham.
[2151.60 --> 2152.66]  And God begins
[2152.66 --> 2153.96]  to reintroduce
[2153.96 --> 2155.52]  himself as God
[2155.52 --> 2157.54]  to Abraham
[2157.54 --> 2158.54]  and his family
[2158.54 --> 2160.02]  as that family
[2160.02 --> 2160.80]  grows the people
[2160.80 --> 2161.30]  of Israel.
[2162.24 --> 2163.04]  And then wherever
[2163.04 --> 2164.48]  Abraham went
[2164.48 --> 2165.40]  and wherever
[2165.40 --> 2166.30]  his family goes,
[2166.60 --> 2167.28]  he's spreading
[2167.28 --> 2168.00]  the knowledge
[2168.00 --> 2169.10]  of the true God.
[2170.10 --> 2170.80]  And there are
[2170.80 --> 2171.60]  some Gentiles
[2171.60 --> 2172.86]  who seem to recognize
[2172.86 --> 2174.32]  and come to know
[2174.32 --> 2174.92]  the true God,
[2174.98 --> 2175.60]  but they are
[2175.60 --> 2176.72]  few and far between.
[2177.36 --> 2178.46]  Most of the Gentiles
[2178.46 --> 2179.56]  do not worship God
[2179.56 --> 2180.44]  and they don't know him.
[2181.76 --> 2182.82]  And so Paul uses this
[2182.82 --> 2183.42]  as a picture
[2183.42 --> 2184.04]  of the life
[2184.04 --> 2184.80]  that all of us
[2184.80 --> 2185.82]  lived before
[2185.82 --> 2186.80]  we knew Christ.
[2187.74 --> 2188.62]  And he talks
[2188.62 --> 2189.82]  about a few features
[2189.82 --> 2191.56]  of this life
[2191.56 --> 2193.58]  that we used to live
[2193.58 --> 2194.38]  or that the world
[2194.38 --> 2195.56]  lives without God.
[2196.02 --> 2197.08]  So first he says
[2197.08 --> 2198.02]  in verse 18
[2198.02 --> 2199.62]  that they are
[2199.62 --> 2200.28]  darkened
[2200.28 --> 2201.28]  in their understanding
[2201.28 --> 2202.66]  and separated
[2202.66 --> 2203.40]  from the life
[2203.40 --> 2203.94]  of God
[2203.94 --> 2204.78]  because of the
[2204.78 --> 2205.58]  ignorance that is
[2205.58 --> 2205.88]  in them
[2205.88 --> 2206.74]  due to the
[2206.74 --> 2207.34]  hardening
[2207.34 --> 2208.50]  of their hearts.
[2209.46 --> 2210.42]  Okay, so in the Bible
[2210.42 --> 2212.32]  to have a hard
[2212.32 --> 2213.00]  heart
[2213.00 --> 2214.36]  means
[2214.36 --> 2215.78]  a stubborn
[2215.78 --> 2216.66]  refusal
[2216.66 --> 2218.02]  to acknowledge
[2218.02 --> 2218.54]  God
[2218.54 --> 2219.66]  and to glorify
[2219.66 --> 2220.04]  him.
[2220.66 --> 2221.38]  It's basically
[2221.38 --> 2222.62]  living in this world
[2222.62 --> 2223.96]  that God has made,
[2224.20 --> 2225.10]  he has created us,
[2225.70 --> 2226.62]  living in this world
[2226.62 --> 2227.52]  but just without any
[2227.52 --> 2228.76]  reference to God
[2228.76 --> 2229.40]  whatsoever.
[2230.28 --> 2231.04]  Just walking
[2231.04 --> 2231.70]  in this ways
[2231.70 --> 2232.38]  that is totally
[2232.38 --> 2233.32]  at odds
[2233.32 --> 2234.42]  with God
[2234.42 --> 2235.22]  and his loving
[2235.22 --> 2235.72]  intentions
[2235.72 --> 2236.80]  for his creation.
[2237.84 --> 2238.76]  Now there's a
[2238.76 --> 2239.56]  parallel passage
[2239.56 --> 2240.80]  in Romans chapter 1
[2240.80 --> 2242.40]  where Paul says
[2242.40 --> 2243.62]  for although
[2243.62 --> 2245.56]  they knew God
[2245.56 --> 2249.08]  they neither glorified
[2249.08 --> 2249.52]  him
[2249.52 --> 2250.84]  as God
[2250.84 --> 2251.76]  nor gave thanks
[2251.76 --> 2252.18]  to him
[2252.18 --> 2253.40]  but their thinking
[2253.40 --> 2254.54]  became futile.
[2255.10 --> 2255.70]  Their foolish
[2255.70 --> 2256.78]  hearts were
[2256.78 --> 2257.82]  darkened.
[2260.12 --> 2260.58]  And so this
[2260.58 --> 2261.54]  hardness of heart
[2261.54 --> 2262.80]  leads to a
[2262.80 --> 2263.80]  darkened mind.
[2263.88 --> 2264.62]  So if we go back
[2264.62 --> 2265.36]  again and look at
[2265.36 --> 2266.02]  verse 18
[2266.02 --> 2266.68]  in our passage
[2266.68 --> 2268.02]  he says
[2268.02 --> 2269.34]  they are darkened
[2269.34 --> 2271.08]  in their understanding.
[2272.16 --> 2272.54]  And so this
[2272.54 --> 2273.66]  hardness of heart
[2273.66 --> 2274.98]  that comes from
[2274.98 --> 2276.04]  rejecting the God
[2276.04 --> 2277.28]  that we all know
[2277.28 --> 2278.14]  right Romans 1
[2278.14 --> 2278.54]  says
[2278.54 --> 2280.92]  everyone knows
[2280.92 --> 2281.36]  God
[2281.36 --> 2282.26]  it can be seen
[2282.26 --> 2282.92]  through the creation
[2282.92 --> 2283.70]  that God made
[2283.70 --> 2284.80]  his glory and power
[2284.80 --> 2285.64]  but we
[2285.64 --> 2286.72]  in our sinfulness
[2286.72 --> 2287.78]  reject the knowledge
[2287.78 --> 2288.42]  of this God
[2288.42 --> 2289.28]  it leads to a
[2289.28 --> 2290.08]  hardening of our
[2290.08 --> 2290.76]  hearts
[2290.76 --> 2292.46]  and then that
[2292.46 --> 2293.30]  leads us to be
[2293.30 --> 2294.28]  separated from
[2294.28 --> 2295.12]  the life of God.
[2295.30 --> 2295.60]  So look
[2295.60 --> 2296.02]  I know
[2296.02 --> 2296.74]  this is a dark
[2296.74 --> 2297.50]  picture already
[2297.50 --> 2298.06]  that Paul is
[2298.06 --> 2298.88]  painting for us.
[2299.56 --> 2299.92]  And then Paul
[2299.92 --> 2301.30]  continues in verse 19
[2301.30 --> 2302.82]  and he says
[2302.82 --> 2304.00]  having lost
[2304.00 --> 2305.40]  all sensitivity
[2305.40 --> 2306.62]  or as some
[2306.62 --> 2307.58]  translations say
[2307.58 --> 2308.84]  they have become
[2308.84 --> 2309.86]  callous.
[2310.68 --> 2311.52]  So what does it
[2311.52 --> 2312.08]  mean to lose
[2312.08 --> 2312.74]  sensitivity
[2312.74 --> 2313.92]  or to become
[2313.92 --> 2314.44]  callous?
[2314.78 --> 2314.98]  You know
[2314.98 --> 2315.40]  when I was
[2315.40 --> 2315.70]  younger
[2315.70 --> 2316.20]  I learned
[2316.20 --> 2316.56]  to play
[2316.56 --> 2316.96]  guitar
[2316.96 --> 2318.44]  and if you've
[2318.44 --> 2319.14]  ever seen
[2319.14 --> 2320.00]  people play
[2320.00 --> 2320.52]  guitar
[2320.52 --> 2321.90]  it looks so
[2321.90 --> 2322.56]  easy right
[2322.56 --> 2323.00]  if you see
[2323.00 --> 2323.54]  Mel play
[2323.54 --> 2323.98]  he just
[2323.98 --> 2325.60]  it looks very
[2325.60 --> 2326.04]  easy
[2326.04 --> 2327.06]  you just put
[2327.06 --> 2327.62]  your fingers
[2327.62 --> 2328.44]  on the strings
[2328.44 --> 2330.02]  but if you've
[2330.02 --> 2330.68]  ever played
[2330.68 --> 2331.06]  before
[2331.06 --> 2331.80]  especially if
[2331.80 --> 2332.36]  you've played
[2332.36 --> 2333.44]  an acoustic
[2333.44 --> 2334.02]  guitar
[2334.02 --> 2334.98]  which is
[2334.98 --> 2335.32]  what most
[2335.32 --> 2335.92]  people do
[2335.92 --> 2337.52]  it's hard
[2337.52 --> 2338.28]  to actually
[2338.28 --> 2338.90]  make any
[2338.90 --> 2339.66]  sound out
[2339.66 --> 2340.10]  of it at
[2340.10 --> 2340.58]  all
[2340.58 --> 2341.14]  if you've
[2341.14 --> 2341.48]  never done
[2341.48 --> 2341.92]  it before
[2341.92 --> 2343.74]  you've got
[2343.74 --> 2344.26]  to push
[2344.26 --> 2345.00]  the strings
[2345.00 --> 2345.40]  down
[2345.40 --> 2346.90]  really hard
[2346.90 --> 2348.12]  and you
[2348.12 --> 2348.80]  use the tips
[2348.80 --> 2349.70]  of your fingers
[2349.70 --> 2350.98]  and you push
[2350.98 --> 2351.54]  down hard
[2351.54 --> 2352.00]  and you have
[2352.00 --> 2352.44]  to hold
[2352.44 --> 2353.00]  it there
[2353.00 --> 2354.32]  and so the
[2354.32 --> 2354.78]  first time
[2354.78 --> 2355.14]  you play
[2355.14 --> 2355.58]  guitar
[2355.58 --> 2355.98]  when you're
[2355.98 --> 2356.22]  done
[2356.22 --> 2356.98]  your fingers
[2356.98 --> 2357.80]  are hurting
[2357.80 --> 2358.40]  and you've
[2358.40 --> 2358.78]  got these
[2358.78 --> 2359.78]  red indents
[2359.78 --> 2360.46]  from the
[2360.46 --> 2360.80]  strings
[2360.80 --> 2361.12]  and it's
[2361.12 --> 2361.64]  awful
[2361.64 --> 2362.36]  and you
[2362.36 --> 2362.70]  can't just
[2362.70 --> 2363.10]  go practice
[2363.10 --> 2363.42]  the next
[2363.42 --> 2363.66]  day
[2363.66 --> 2364.12]  because your
[2364.12 --> 2364.60]  fingers hurt
[2364.60 --> 2365.12]  so much
[2365.12 --> 2366.96]  but if
[2366.96 --> 2367.46]  you keep
[2367.46 --> 2368.00]  practicing
[2368.00 --> 2369.28]  what happens
[2369.28 --> 2369.58]  to your
[2369.58 --> 2370.02]  fingers
[2370.02 --> 2371.84]  they grow
[2371.84 --> 2372.32]  calluses
[2372.32 --> 2373.76]  and then
[2373.76 --> 2374.32]  it's easy
[2374.32 --> 2375.56]  you can play
[2375.56 --> 2376.26]  guitar and you
[2376.26 --> 2376.86]  press down
[2376.86 --> 2377.20]  on the
[2377.20 --> 2377.52]  strings
[2377.52 --> 2377.94]  and there's
[2377.94 --> 2378.68]  no pain
[2378.68 --> 2379.38]  at all
[2379.38 --> 2379.90]  right
[2379.90 --> 2380.46]  calluses
[2380.46 --> 2381.76]  take away
[2381.76 --> 2382.80]  sensitivity
[2382.80 --> 2384.18]  and now
[2384.18 --> 2384.48]  for the
[2384.48 --> 2384.86]  guitar
[2384.86 --> 2385.50]  this is
[2385.50 --> 2385.78]  okay
[2385.78 --> 2386.00]  right
[2386.00 --> 2386.36]  this is
[2386.36 --> 2386.74]  what you
[2386.74 --> 2387.06]  want
[2387.06 --> 2387.38]  you don't
[2387.38 --> 2387.66]  want
[2387.66 --> 2387.82]  your
[2387.82 --> 2388.18]  fingers
[2388.18 --> 2388.68]  to hurt
[2388.68 --> 2390.16]  but here
[2390.16 --> 2390.66]  Paul is
[2390.66 --> 2390.92]  saying
[2390.92 --> 2391.24]  that a
[2391.24 --> 2391.54]  hardened
[2391.54 --> 2391.92]  heart
[2391.92 --> 2392.18]  and a
[2392.18 --> 2392.54]  darkened
[2392.54 --> 2392.90]  mind
[2392.90 --> 2393.36]  leads
[2393.36 --> 2393.54]  to
[2393.54 --> 2394.08]  becoming
[2394.08 --> 2395.38]  calloused
[2395.38 --> 2396.24]  where you
[2396.24 --> 2396.70]  lose all
[2396.70 --> 2397.42]  sensitivity
[2397.42 --> 2399.12]  not to
[2399.12 --> 2399.68]  strings
[2399.68 --> 2400.42]  but to
[2400.42 --> 2400.80]  good
[2400.80 --> 2402.06]  and evil
[2402.06 --> 2402.76]  you lose
[2402.76 --> 2403.30]  the ability
[2403.30 --> 2403.76]  to know
[2403.76 --> 2404.12]  what is
[2404.12 --> 2404.52]  truly
[2404.52 --> 2405.06]  good
[2405.06 --> 2406.18]  and beautiful
[2406.18 --> 2407.38]  and right
[2407.38 --> 2408.70]  in reality
[2408.70 --> 2411.26]  so then
[2411.26 --> 2412.04]  what happens
[2412.04 --> 2413.46]  you give
[2413.46 --> 2414.10]  yourself up
[2414.10 --> 2415.14]  to sensuality
[2415.14 --> 2415.58]  and greed
[2415.58 --> 2415.94]  and that's
[2415.94 --> 2416.38]  what Paul
[2416.38 --> 2417.28]  says
[2417.28 --> 2418.22]  in verse
[2418.22 --> 2418.66]  19
[2418.66 --> 2418.96]  as he
[2418.96 --> 2419.68]  continues
[2419.68 --> 2421.24]  having
[2421.24 --> 2422.14]  lost all
[2422.14 --> 2422.62]  sensitivity
[2422.62 --> 2422.90]  right
[2422.90 --> 2423.22]  becoming
[2423.22 --> 2423.92]  calloused
[2423.92 --> 2424.46]  well what
[2424.46 --> 2424.88]  happens
[2424.88 --> 2426.02]  they give
[2426.02 --> 2426.70]  themselves over
[2426.70 --> 2427.70]  to sensuality
[2427.70 --> 2428.32]  so as to
[2428.32 --> 2428.76]  indulge in
[2428.76 --> 2429.30]  every kind
[2429.30 --> 2429.86]  of impurity
[2429.86 --> 2430.62]  and they
[2430.62 --> 2430.92]  are full
[2430.92 --> 2431.38]  of greed
[2431.38 --> 2435.66]  I once
[2435.66 --> 2437.46]  heard a
[2437.46 --> 2438.08]  pastor share
[2438.08 --> 2438.52]  this story
[2438.52 --> 2438.84]  I forget
[2438.84 --> 2439.22]  when and
[2439.22 --> 2439.50]  where it
[2439.50 --> 2439.82]  was
[2439.82 --> 2440.84]  but he
[2440.84 --> 2441.28]  talked about
[2441.28 --> 2441.82]  an elder
[2441.82 --> 2442.30]  in his
[2442.30 --> 2442.70]  church
[2442.70 --> 2444.18]  and the
[2444.18 --> 2444.54]  elder
[2444.54 --> 2445.68]  had left
[2445.68 --> 2446.28]  his wife
[2446.28 --> 2447.56]  to take
[2447.56 --> 2447.82]  up a
[2447.82 --> 2448.30]  relationship
[2448.30 --> 2448.74]  with a
[2448.74 --> 2448.94]  younger
[2448.94 --> 2449.30]  woman
[2449.30 --> 2450.78]  and so
[2450.78 --> 2451.32]  the pastor
[2451.32 --> 2452.28]  met with
[2452.28 --> 2452.46]  him
[2452.46 --> 2452.76]  and he
[2452.76 --> 2453.46]  told him
[2453.46 --> 2454.00]  you are
[2454.00 --> 2454.70]  choosing to
[2454.70 --> 2455.08]  live in
[2455.08 --> 2455.40]  sin
[2455.40 --> 2456.76]  but the
[2456.76 --> 2457.20]  man
[2457.20 --> 2457.72]  the elder
[2457.72 --> 2458.06]  showed
[2458.06 --> 2458.52]  no
[2458.52 --> 2459.42]  softening
[2459.42 --> 2459.78]  of his
[2459.78 --> 2460.08]  heart
[2460.08 --> 2460.40]  and he
[2460.40 --> 2460.82]  said to
[2460.82 --> 2461.22]  the pastor
[2461.22 --> 2461.60]  I have
[2461.60 --> 2462.28]  never felt
[2462.28 --> 2463.84]  more alive
[2463.84 --> 2465.64]  right
[2465.64 --> 2466.12]  and so
[2466.12 --> 2466.52]  in one
[2466.52 --> 2467.00]  sense
[2467.00 --> 2467.46]  sure
[2467.46 --> 2468.00]  what he's
[2468.00 --> 2468.20]  saying
[2468.20 --> 2468.72]  is probably
[2468.72 --> 2469.10]  true
[2469.10 --> 2469.36]  right
[2469.36 --> 2469.66]  sin
[2469.66 --> 2470.18]  is fun
[2470.18 --> 2470.78]  sin
[2470.78 --> 2471.44]  is pleasurable
[2471.44 --> 2472.56]  at least
[2472.56 --> 2472.84]  in the
[2472.84 --> 2473.24]  beginning
[2473.24 --> 2473.90]  and that's
[2473.90 --> 2474.42]  why it's
[2474.42 --> 2474.82]  attractive
[2474.82 --> 2475.12]  that's
[2475.12 --> 2475.40]  why we
[2475.40 --> 2475.90]  do it
[2475.90 --> 2477.12]  but his
[2477.12 --> 2477.72]  heart
[2477.72 --> 2478.98]  had become
[2478.98 --> 2479.68]  hard
[2479.68 --> 2480.30]  and his
[2480.30 --> 2480.70]  mind
[2480.70 --> 2481.36]  darkened
[2481.36 --> 2481.86]  to God
[2481.86 --> 2482.14]  and it
[2482.14 --> 2482.38]  led to
[2482.38 --> 2482.58]  this
[2482.58 --> 2483.54]  callousness
[2483.54 --> 2486.28]  this is
[2486.28 --> 2486.88]  quite scary
[2486.88 --> 2487.28]  to think
[2487.28 --> 2487.68]  about
[2487.68 --> 2488.72]  right
[2488.72 --> 2489.08]  to get
[2489.08 --> 2489.38]  to a
[2489.38 --> 2489.66]  point
[2489.66 --> 2490.10]  where you
[2490.10 --> 2490.48]  are no
[2490.48 --> 2490.86]  longer
[2490.86 --> 2491.52]  sensitive
[2491.52 --> 2492.74]  to doing
[2492.74 --> 2493.22]  wrong
[2493.22 --> 2495.02]  you know
[2495.02 --> 2495.36]  and when
[2495.36 --> 2495.80]  you are
[2495.80 --> 2496.26]  a young
[2496.26 --> 2496.76]  child
[2496.76 --> 2497.72]  and you
[2497.72 --> 2498.28]  sin
[2498.28 --> 2499.08]  and you
[2499.08 --> 2499.50]  do something
[2499.50 --> 2499.82]  wrong
[2499.82 --> 2500.70]  you feel
[2500.70 --> 2501.70]  really bad
[2501.70 --> 2502.38]  about it
[2502.38 --> 2503.18]  right
[2503.18 --> 2504.28]  but feeling
[2504.28 --> 2504.96]  convicted
[2504.96 --> 2505.82]  of sin
[2505.82 --> 2507.10]  is actually
[2507.10 --> 2507.68]  a blessing
[2507.68 --> 2508.34]  from God
[2508.34 --> 2509.68]  and if you
[2509.68 --> 2510.18]  get to the
[2510.18 --> 2510.76]  point in your
[2510.76 --> 2511.30]  lives where
[2511.30 --> 2511.78]  you sin
[2511.78 --> 2512.24]  but then you
[2512.24 --> 2513.00]  don't care
[2513.00 --> 2514.66]  that's when
[2514.66 --> 2515.02]  you should
[2515.02 --> 2515.52]  be most
[2515.52 --> 2516.14]  concerned
[2516.14 --> 2516.70]  for your
[2516.70 --> 2517.08]  soul
[2517.08 --> 2519.68]  and so
[2519.68 --> 2520.12]  we should
[2520.12 --> 2520.70]  embrace
[2520.70 --> 2521.34]  this conviction
[2521.34 --> 2521.82]  of sin
[2521.82 --> 2522.24]  when our
[2522.24 --> 2522.72]  conscience
[2522.72 --> 2523.90]  tells us
[2523.90 --> 2524.42]  that what
[2524.42 --> 2524.70]  we are
[2524.70 --> 2525.04]  doing
[2525.04 --> 2526.64]  is wrong
[2526.64 --> 2526.94]  and we
[2526.94 --> 2527.54]  are sinning
[2527.54 --> 2528.42]  against God
[2528.42 --> 2529.46]  because
[2529.46 --> 2530.18]  as we
[2530.18 --> 2530.82]  embrace
[2530.82 --> 2531.68]  this conviction
[2531.68 --> 2533.82]  it is our
[2533.82 --> 2534.46]  connection
[2534.46 --> 2535.18]  to God's
[2535.18 --> 2535.68]  reality
[2535.68 --> 2537.34]  and this
[2537.34 --> 2537.62]  is the
[2537.62 --> 2537.90]  reason
[2537.90 --> 2538.40]  that we
[2538.40 --> 2539.12]  all should
[2539.12 --> 2539.60]  avoid
[2539.60 --> 2540.04]  sin
[2540.04 --> 2540.34]  in our
[2540.34 --> 2540.62]  lives
[2540.62 --> 2540.88]  because
[2540.88 --> 2541.46]  every time
[2541.46 --> 2542.12]  we encounter
[2542.12 --> 2542.46]  sin
[2542.46 --> 2543.40]  every time
[2543.40 --> 2544.46]  we engage
[2544.46 --> 2544.94]  in sin
[2544.94 --> 2545.80]  it's going
[2545.80 --> 2546.54]  to weaken
[2546.54 --> 2546.88]  our
[2546.88 --> 2547.52]  sensitivity
[2547.52 --> 2548.48]  right
[2548.48 --> 2548.98]  every time
[2548.98 --> 2549.32]  you give
[2549.32 --> 2549.80]  into sin
[2549.80 --> 2550.30]  and you
[2550.30 --> 2551.08]  choose
[2551.08 --> 2552.00]  to love
[2552.00 --> 2552.42]  your sin
[2552.42 --> 2553.04]  more than
[2553.04 --> 2553.38]  you love
[2553.38 --> 2553.78]  Jesus
[2553.78 --> 2554.62]  and that's
[2554.62 --> 2554.94]  what we do
[2554.94 --> 2555.30]  every time
[2555.30 --> 2555.70]  we sin
[2555.70 --> 2556.30]  we're saying
[2556.30 --> 2556.66]  we want
[2556.66 --> 2557.50]  we want
[2557.50 --> 2557.78]  the sin
[2557.78 --> 2558.10]  more than
[2558.10 --> 2558.34]  we want
[2558.34 --> 2558.64]  Jesus
[2558.64 --> 2559.22]  in that
[2559.22 --> 2559.42]  moment
[2559.42 --> 2559.70]  we all
[2559.70 --> 2560.20]  do this
[2560.20 --> 2561.86]  but every
[2561.86 --> 2562.20]  time we
[2562.20 --> 2562.66]  do that
[2562.66 --> 2563.12]  it's just
[2563.12 --> 2563.48]  like
[2563.48 --> 2565.04]  our fingers
[2565.04 --> 2565.52]  getting just
[2565.52 --> 2566.04]  a little bit
[2566.04 --> 2566.54]  hardened
[2566.54 --> 2567.62]  right
[2567.62 --> 2568.92]  it becomes
[2568.92 --> 2569.46]  easier
[2569.46 --> 2570.12]  and easier
[2570.12 --> 2570.88]  for us
[2570.88 --> 2571.26]  then to
[2571.26 --> 2571.48]  lose
[2571.48 --> 2571.98]  sensitivity
[2571.98 --> 2572.52]  and to
[2572.52 --> 2572.88]  walk
[2572.88 --> 2573.14]  in the
[2573.14 --> 2573.32]  ways
[2573.32 --> 2573.70]  of sin
[2573.70 --> 2574.20]  it becomes
[2574.20 --> 2575.04]  a path
[2575.04 --> 2575.36]  that we
[2575.36 --> 2575.56]  just
[2575.56 --> 2575.98]  follow
[2575.98 --> 2577.48]  and Paul
[2577.48 --> 2577.90]  is saying
[2577.90 --> 2578.60]  that was
[2578.60 --> 2579.28]  each of
[2579.28 --> 2579.62]  us
[2579.62 --> 2580.22]  before
[2580.22 --> 2580.76]  we were
[2580.76 --> 2581.10]  saved
[2581.10 --> 2581.82]  by Christ
[2581.82 --> 2582.94]  but then
[2582.94 --> 2583.32]  he says
[2583.32 --> 2583.66]  but your
[2583.66 --> 2584.02]  dead
[2584.02 --> 2584.40]  cold
[2584.40 --> 2584.84]  callous
[2584.84 --> 2585.34]  hearts
[2585.34 --> 2585.88]  that had
[2585.88 --> 2586.26]  led you
[2586.26 --> 2586.50]  to be
[2586.50 --> 2586.86]  separated
[2586.86 --> 2587.52]  from God
[2587.52 --> 2588.28]  that all
[2588.28 --> 2588.78]  changed
[2588.78 --> 2589.22]  when you
[2589.22 --> 2589.66]  learned
[2589.66 --> 2590.18]  Christ
[2590.18 --> 2590.50]  and the
[2590.50 --> 2590.82]  lights
[2590.82 --> 2591.54]  came on
[2591.54 --> 2592.84]  you walk
[2592.84 --> 2593.06]  out of
[2593.06 --> 2593.46]  the darkness
[2593.46 --> 2593.96]  you step
[2593.96 --> 2594.34]  into the
[2594.34 --> 2594.62]  light
[2594.62 --> 2595.24]  and it's
[2595.24 --> 2595.74]  like John
[2595.74 --> 2596.22]  Calvin talks
[2596.22 --> 2596.56]  about putting
[2596.56 --> 2596.80]  new
[2596.80 --> 2597.30]  spectacles
[2597.30 --> 2597.66]  on
[2597.66 --> 2598.30]  where you
[2598.30 --> 2598.64]  just see
[2598.64 --> 2599.06]  everything
[2599.06 --> 2599.48]  in a
[2599.48 --> 2599.66]  whole
[2599.66 --> 2599.88]  new
[2599.88 --> 2600.24]  way
[2600.24 --> 2602.84]  but he's
[2602.84 --> 2603.24]  giving us
[2603.24 --> 2603.76]  this warning
[2603.76 --> 2605.54]  because it
[2605.54 --> 2605.92]  is still
[2605.92 --> 2606.44]  possible
[2606.44 --> 2607.02]  for us
[2607.02 --> 2607.52]  to give
[2607.52 --> 2608.38]  into sin
[2608.38 --> 2609.28]  in such
[2609.28 --> 2609.54]  a way
[2609.54 --> 2609.88]  that it
[2609.88 --> 2610.50]  can have
[2610.50 --> 2611.18]  a hardening
[2611.18 --> 2611.64]  effect
[2611.64 --> 2612.36]  on our
[2612.36 --> 2612.74]  hearts
[2612.74 --> 2614.34]  in such
[2614.34 --> 2614.54]  a way
[2614.54 --> 2614.80]  that it
[2614.80 --> 2615.14]  can lead
[2615.14 --> 2615.50]  us away
[2615.50 --> 2615.96]  from God
[2615.96 --> 2617.20]  but in
[2617.20 --> 2617.94]  contrast
[2617.94 --> 2618.84]  the Christian
[2618.84 --> 2619.44]  life is a
[2619.44 --> 2620.04]  life of
[2620.04 --> 2620.86]  continually
[2620.86 --> 2622.10]  repenting
[2622.10 --> 2622.54]  of sin
[2622.54 --> 2623.12]  and turning
[2623.12 --> 2623.72]  to God
[2623.72 --> 2624.24]  in faith
[2624.24 --> 2626.00]  and the
[2626.00 --> 2626.26]  way that
[2626.26 --> 2626.54]  we do
[2626.54 --> 2626.86]  that
[2626.86 --> 2627.38]  is by
[2627.38 --> 2627.70]  killing
[2627.70 --> 2628.12]  sin
[2628.12 --> 2628.92]  and this
[2628.92 --> 2629.26]  is what
[2629.26 --> 2629.56]  C.S.
[2629.62 --> 2630.00]  Lewis is
[2630.00 --> 2630.42]  describing
[2630.42 --> 2630.96]  the story
[2630.96 --> 2631.22]  of the
[2631.22 --> 2631.74]  young man
[2631.74 --> 2632.36]  with this
[2632.36 --> 2632.54]  red
[2632.54 --> 2632.88]  lizard
[2632.88 --> 2634.22]  so let me
[2634.22 --> 2634.76]  continue the
[2634.76 --> 2635.06]  story
[2635.06 --> 2635.44]  the man
[2635.44 --> 2636.58]  finally relents
[2636.58 --> 2636.90]  he gives
[2636.90 --> 2637.40]  permission
[2637.40 --> 2638.26]  to the
[2638.26 --> 2638.62]  angel
[2638.62 --> 2639.54]  to kill
[2639.54 --> 2640.08]  the lizard
[2640.08 --> 2641.32]  so the
[2641.32 --> 2641.74]  angel
[2641.74 --> 2642.60]  seizes
[2642.60 --> 2643.22]  the lizard
[2643.22 --> 2643.82]  with his
[2643.82 --> 2644.16]  hands
[2644.16 --> 2644.72]  blazing
[2644.72 --> 2645.26]  with heat
[2645.26 --> 2645.76]  and he
[2645.76 --> 2646.38]  strangles
[2646.38 --> 2646.66]  it to
[2646.66 --> 2646.90]  death
[2646.90 --> 2647.22]  and he
[2647.22 --> 2647.86]  flings it
[2647.86 --> 2648.42]  to the
[2648.42 --> 2648.82]  ground
[2648.82 --> 2650.32]  and here's
[2650.32 --> 2650.96]  what happens
[2650.96 --> 2651.52]  next
[2651.52 --> 2653.38]  at first
[2653.38 --> 2653.86]  I thought
[2653.86 --> 2654.52]  the operation
[2654.52 --> 2655.20]  had failed
[2655.20 --> 2656.60]  so far
[2656.60 --> 2657.20]  from dying
[2657.20 --> 2657.74]  the creature
[2657.74 --> 2658.14]  was still
[2658.14 --> 2658.62]  struggling
[2658.62 --> 2659.54]  and even
[2659.54 --> 2660.32]  growing bigger
[2660.32 --> 2661.04]  as it
[2661.04 --> 2661.40]  struggled
[2661.40 --> 2663.00]  but as it
[2663.00 --> 2663.40]  grew
[2663.40 --> 2664.80]  it changed
[2664.80 --> 2666.40]  its hinder
[2666.40 --> 2667.22]  parts grew
[2667.22 --> 2667.82]  rounder
[2667.82 --> 2668.98]  the tail
[2668.98 --> 2669.74]  still flickering
[2669.74 --> 2670.26]  became a
[2670.26 --> 2671.00]  tail of hair
[2671.00 --> 2672.10]  that flickered
[2672.10 --> 2672.88]  between huge
[2672.88 --> 2673.32]  and glossy
[2673.32 --> 2673.92]  buttocks
[2673.92 --> 2676.16]  suddenly
[2676.16 --> 2677.08]  I started
[2677.08 --> 2677.56]  back
[2677.56 --> 2678.36]  rubbing my
[2678.36 --> 2678.78]  eyes
[2678.78 --> 2679.62]  what stood
[2679.62 --> 2680.30]  before me
[2680.30 --> 2681.36]  was the
[2681.36 --> 2681.80]  greatest
[2681.80 --> 2682.80]  stallion
[2682.80 --> 2683.78]  I have
[2683.78 --> 2684.74]  ever seen
[2684.74 --> 2686.02]  silvery
[2686.02 --> 2686.54]  white
[2686.54 --> 2687.22]  but with a
[2687.22 --> 2687.52]  mane
[2687.52 --> 2687.86]  and a
[2687.86 --> 2688.34]  tail of
[2688.34 --> 2688.72]  gold
[2688.72 --> 2689.78]  it was
[2689.78 --> 2690.28]  smooth
[2690.28 --> 2690.96]  and shining
[2690.96 --> 2691.58]  rippled
[2691.58 --> 2692.42]  with swells
[2692.42 --> 2693.00]  of flesh
[2693.00 --> 2693.66]  and muscle
[2693.66 --> 2694.60]  whinnying
[2694.60 --> 2695.32]  and stamping
[2695.32 --> 2695.84]  with its
[2695.84 --> 2696.26]  hooves
[2696.26 --> 2698.20]  a new
[2698.20 --> 2698.98]  made man
[2698.98 --> 2700.02]  I turned
[2700.02 --> 2700.80]  and clapped
[2700.80 --> 2701.44]  the horse's
[2701.44 --> 2701.82]  neck
[2701.82 --> 2703.12]  in joyous
[2703.12 --> 2703.98]  haste
[2703.98 --> 2704.64]  I leaped
[2704.64 --> 2705.20]  upon the
[2705.20 --> 2705.62]  horse's
[2705.62 --> 2705.98]  back
[2705.98 --> 2707.20]  then nudged
[2707.20 --> 2707.78]  the stallion
[2707.78 --> 2708.10]  with my
[2708.10 --> 2708.42]  heels
[2708.42 --> 2708.72]  and we
[2708.72 --> 2709.36]  were off
[2709.36 --> 2710.22]  like a
[2710.22 --> 2710.42]  shooting
[2710.42 --> 2710.84]  star
[2710.84 --> 2714.06]  this ugly
[2714.06 --> 2714.70]  red
[2714.70 --> 2715.96]  miserable
[2715.96 --> 2716.44]  lizard
[2716.44 --> 2717.84]  that
[2717.84 --> 2718.30]  tormented
[2718.30 --> 2718.74]  him
[2718.74 --> 2720.22]  that represents
[2720.22 --> 2720.86]  a sin
[2720.86 --> 2721.84]  always on
[2721.84 --> 2722.38]  his shoulder
[2722.38 --> 2723.48]  becomes
[2723.48 --> 2724.42]  when he
[2724.42 --> 2725.08]  kills a sin
[2725.08 --> 2725.56]  a beautiful
[2725.56 --> 2726.08]  stallion
[2726.08 --> 2726.58]  and the
[2726.58 --> 2727.04]  young man
[2727.04 --> 2727.56]  that no
[2727.56 --> 2728.12]  longer is
[2728.12 --> 2728.72]  in bondage
[2728.72 --> 2729.16]  to sin
[2729.16 --> 2729.44]  but is
[2729.44 --> 2729.80]  now
[2729.80 --> 2730.72]  free
[2730.72 --> 2734.06]  so next
[2734.06 --> 2735.16]  Paul turns
[2735.16 --> 2735.94]  to the
[2735.94 --> 2736.30]  freedom
[2736.30 --> 2736.76]  and the
[2736.76 --> 2737.10]  beauty
[2737.10 --> 2737.58]  of this
[2737.58 --> 2738.02]  life
[2738.02 --> 2738.84]  of running
[2738.84 --> 2739.42]  with horses
[2739.42 --> 2739.94]  and that's
[2739.94 --> 2740.28]  the second
[2740.28 --> 2740.72]  thing we see
[2740.72 --> 2740.90]  in this
[2740.90 --> 2741.34]  passage
[2741.34 --> 2743.34]  so verses
[2743.34 --> 2744.88]  22 to
[2744.88 --> 2745.28]  24
[2745.28 --> 2746.72]  are the
[2746.72 --> 2747.16]  key to
[2747.16 --> 2747.44]  this whole
[2747.44 --> 2747.88]  passage
[2747.88 --> 2749.06]  so let's
[2749.06 --> 2749.40]  read that
[2749.40 --> 2749.96]  again together
[2749.96 --> 2750.22]  and let's
[2750.22 --> 2750.48]  look at
[2750.48 --> 2750.68]  that
[2750.68 --> 2751.00]  this is
[2751.00 --> 2751.30]  what Paul
[2751.30 --> 2751.66]  writes
[2751.66 --> 2752.38]  he says
[2752.38 --> 2752.64]  you were
[2752.64 --> 2753.06]  taught
[2753.06 --> 2754.00]  with regard
[2754.00 --> 2754.40]  to this
[2754.40 --> 2755.00]  former way
[2755.00 --> 2755.62]  of life
[2755.62 --> 2756.70]  to put
[2756.70 --> 2757.22]  off your
[2757.22 --> 2757.82]  old self
[2757.82 --> 2758.68]  which is
[2758.68 --> 2759.30]  being corrupted
[2759.30 --> 2759.86]  by its
[2759.86 --> 2760.68]  deceitful
[2760.68 --> 2761.58]  desires
[2761.58 --> 2762.54]  deceitful
[2762.54 --> 2762.94]  desires
[2762.94 --> 2763.78]  not good
[2763.78 --> 2764.28]  desires
[2764.28 --> 2765.32]  right
[2765.32 --> 2765.80]  we have
[2765.80 --> 2766.12]  desires
[2766.12 --> 2766.44]  we think
[2766.44 --> 2766.60]  they're
[2766.60 --> 2766.84]  good
[2766.84 --> 2767.32]  no some
[2767.32 --> 2767.68]  desires
[2767.68 --> 2768.28]  are deceitful
[2768.28 --> 2769.64]  deceitful
[2769.64 --> 2770.06]  desires
[2770.06 --> 2770.80]  to be
[2770.80 --> 2771.56]  made new
[2771.56 --> 2772.60]  in the
[2772.60 --> 2772.96]  attitude
[2772.96 --> 2773.28]  of your
[2773.28 --> 2773.76]  minds
[2773.76 --> 2774.74]  and to
[2774.74 --> 2775.12]  put on
[2775.12 --> 2775.54]  the new
[2775.54 --> 2775.94]  self
[2775.94 --> 2776.48]  created
[2776.48 --> 2776.82]  to be
[2776.82 --> 2777.10]  like
[2777.10 --> 2777.58]  God
[2777.58 --> 2777.94]  in true
[2777.94 --> 2778.46]  righteousness
[2778.46 --> 2779.94]  and holiness
[2779.94 --> 2782.20]  so how
[2782.20 --> 2782.42]  do we
[2782.42 --> 2782.94]  experience
[2782.94 --> 2783.40]  this kind
[2783.40 --> 2783.92]  of transformation
[2783.92 --> 2784.48]  in our
[2784.48 --> 2784.74]  lives
[2784.74 --> 2785.12]  where we
[2785.12 --> 2785.88]  run with
[2785.88 --> 2786.22]  horses
[2786.22 --> 2786.66]  where we
[2786.66 --> 2787.08]  pursue
[2787.08 --> 2787.58]  this life
[2787.58 --> 2788.14]  of holiness
[2788.14 --> 2790.02]  there are
[2790.02 --> 2790.64]  three things
[2790.64 --> 2791.04]  here that
[2791.04 --> 2791.64]  Paul says
[2791.64 --> 2791.90]  that I
[2791.90 --> 2792.22]  want to
[2792.22 --> 2792.58]  look at
[2792.58 --> 2792.92]  briefly
[2792.92 --> 2793.44]  each one
[2793.44 --> 2794.04]  so first
[2794.04 --> 2794.36]  the way
[2794.36 --> 2794.74]  we do
[2794.74 --> 2795.04]  this
[2795.04 --> 2795.28]  how do
[2795.28 --> 2795.48]  we
[2795.48 --> 2796.34]  experience
[2796.34 --> 2796.56]  this
[2796.56 --> 2796.94]  transformation
[2796.94 --> 2797.44]  in our
[2797.44 --> 2797.74]  lives
[2797.74 --> 2798.12]  first
[2798.12 --> 2799.00]  it's a
[2799.00 --> 2799.36]  change
[2799.36 --> 2799.66]  from the
[2799.66 --> 2800.14]  inside
[2800.14 --> 2800.78]  okay
[2800.78 --> 2801.02]  it's a
[2801.02 --> 2801.30]  change
[2801.30 --> 2801.60]  from the
[2801.60 --> 2802.06]  inside
[2802.06 --> 2803.10]  so Paul
[2803.10 --> 2803.72]  uses this
[2803.72 --> 2804.14]  word
[2804.14 --> 2804.98]  he uses
[2804.98 --> 2805.32]  this word
[2805.32 --> 2805.78]  to put
[2805.78 --> 2806.20]  off
[2806.20 --> 2807.02]  and to
[2807.02 --> 2807.28]  put
[2807.28 --> 2807.68]  on
[2807.68 --> 2808.64]  right
[2808.64 --> 2809.20]  and usually
[2809.20 --> 2809.72]  what it
[2809.72 --> 2810.02]  meant of
[2810.02 --> 2810.30]  course
[2810.30 --> 2811.52]  originally
[2811.52 --> 2812.14]  is to
[2812.14 --> 2812.64]  put on
[2812.64 --> 2813.14]  clothes
[2813.14 --> 2813.54]  like a
[2813.54 --> 2813.80]  shirt
[2813.80 --> 2814.60]  or a
[2814.60 --> 2814.94]  coat
[2814.94 --> 2816.70]  and in
[2816.70 --> 2817.10]  ancient
[2817.10 --> 2817.92]  times
[2817.92 --> 2818.90]  Greek
[2818.90 --> 2819.32]  writers
[2819.32 --> 2819.82]  actually
[2819.82 --> 2820.16]  also
[2820.16 --> 2820.56]  used it
[2820.56 --> 2821.16]  metaphorically
[2821.16 --> 2821.54]  like Paul
[2821.54 --> 2821.98]  is doing
[2821.98 --> 2822.70]  to talk
[2822.70 --> 2822.92]  about
[2822.92 --> 2823.38]  behavior
[2823.38 --> 2824.62]  they would
[2824.62 --> 2825.26]  talk about
[2825.26 --> 2826.52]  putting on
[2826.52 --> 2827.18]  virtues
[2827.18 --> 2828.42]  so they
[2828.42 --> 2828.70]  would say
[2828.70 --> 2829.18]  put on
[2829.18 --> 2829.76]  justice
[2829.76 --> 2830.52]  put on
[2830.52 --> 2831.00]  honor
[2831.00 --> 2833.14]  things like
[2833.14 --> 2833.40]  that
[2833.40 --> 2834.84]  but nobody
[2834.84 --> 2836.22]  in antiquity
[2836.22 --> 2836.96]  writers of
[2836.96 --> 2837.56]  Paul's day
[2837.56 --> 2838.16]  used it
[2838.16 --> 2838.82]  like this
[2838.82 --> 2839.14]  to say
[2839.14 --> 2839.50]  to put
[2839.50 --> 2839.92]  off
[2839.92 --> 2840.82]  an old
[2840.82 --> 2841.76]  self
[2841.76 --> 2842.78]  or put
[2842.78 --> 2843.04]  on
[2843.04 --> 2843.24]  a
[2843.24 --> 2843.74]  completely
[2843.74 --> 2844.32]  new
[2844.32 --> 2845.00]  self
[2845.00 --> 2845.94]  this
[2845.94 --> 2846.18]  is
[2846.18 --> 2846.44]  new
[2846.44 --> 2846.64]  this
[2846.64 --> 2846.78]  is
[2846.78 --> 2846.98]  totally
[2846.98 --> 2847.40]  radical
[2847.40 --> 2848.06]  because
[2848.06 --> 2848.50]  Paul's
[2848.50 --> 2848.66]  not
[2848.66 --> 2849.04]  talking
[2849.04 --> 2849.28]  about
[2849.28 --> 2849.60]  putting
[2849.60 --> 2849.86]  off
[2849.86 --> 2849.98]  and
[2849.98 --> 2850.20]  putting
[2850.20 --> 2850.38]  on
[2850.38 --> 2851.00]  behaviors
[2851.00 --> 2851.88]  right
[2851.88 --> 2852.08]  that's
[2852.08 --> 2852.20]  not
[2852.20 --> 2852.32]  what
[2852.32 --> 2852.44]  the
[2852.44 --> 2852.68]  Christian
[2852.68 --> 2852.88]  life
[2852.88 --> 2853.00]  is
[2853.00 --> 2853.28]  about
[2853.28 --> 2853.48]  as
[2853.48 --> 2853.62]  we
[2853.62 --> 2853.94]  know
[2853.94 --> 2854.76]  he's
[2854.76 --> 2855.10]  talking
[2855.10 --> 2855.52]  about
[2855.52 --> 2856.02]  a
[2856.02 --> 2856.44]  whole
[2856.44 --> 2857.10]  new
[2857.10 --> 2857.78]  self
[2857.78 --> 2858.46]  it's
[2858.46 --> 2858.58]  a
[2858.58 --> 2859.08]  complete
[2859.08 --> 2860.10]  change
[2860.10 --> 2860.30]  in
[2860.30 --> 2860.76]  identity
[2860.76 --> 2861.08]  from
[2861.08 --> 2861.26]  the
[2861.26 --> 2861.56]  inside
[2861.56 --> 2861.76]  out
[2861.76 --> 2861.96]  a
[2861.96 --> 2862.26]  renovation
[2862.26 --> 2862.76]  of
[2862.76 --> 2862.90]  the
[2862.90 --> 2863.26]  heart
[2863.26 --> 2864.82]  because
[2864.82 --> 2865.28]  becoming
[2865.28 --> 2865.50]  a
[2865.50 --> 2865.76]  Christian
[2865.76 --> 2865.96]  is
[2865.96 --> 2866.20]  about
[2866.20 --> 2866.44]  a
[2866.44 --> 2866.84]  complete
[2866.84 --> 2867.36]  interchange
[2867.36 --> 2868.30]  not
[2868.30 --> 2868.50]  just
[2868.50 --> 2868.80]  how
[2868.80 --> 2869.02]  you
[2869.02 --> 2869.44]  live
[2869.44 --> 2869.82]  but
[2869.82 --> 2870.26]  who
[2870.26 --> 2870.88]  you
[2870.88 --> 2871.30]  are
[2871.30 --> 2872.58]  in
[2872.58 --> 2872.78]  his
[2872.78 --> 2873.02]  book
[2873.02 --> 2873.30]  near
[2873.30 --> 2873.86]  Christianity
[2873.86 --> 2874.36]  C.S.
[2874.42 --> 2874.62]  Lewis
[2874.62 --> 2875.62]  describes
[2875.62 --> 2875.86]  this
[2875.86 --> 2876.12]  new
[2876.12 --> 2876.48]  self
[2876.48 --> 2876.72]  like
[2876.72 --> 2877.12]  this
[2877.12 --> 2878.64]  here's
[2878.64 --> 2878.74]  a
[2878.74 --> 2879.02]  quote
[2879.02 --> 2880.12]  it
[2880.12 --> 2880.38]  says
[2880.38 --> 2880.92]  God
[2880.92 --> 2881.50]  became
[2881.50 --> 2882.08]  man
[2882.08 --> 2882.82]  to
[2882.82 --> 2883.12]  turn
[2883.12 --> 2883.78]  creatures
[2883.78 --> 2884.46]  into
[2884.46 --> 2885.06]  sons
[2885.06 --> 2886.18]  not
[2886.18 --> 2886.58]  simply
[2886.58 --> 2886.82]  to
[2886.82 --> 2887.24]  produce
[2887.24 --> 2887.56]  better
[2887.56 --> 2887.92]  men
[2887.92 --> 2888.28]  of
[2888.28 --> 2888.40]  the
[2888.40 --> 2888.68]  old
[2888.68 --> 2889.18]  kind
[2889.18 --> 2889.98]  but
[2889.98 --> 2890.22]  to
[2890.22 --> 2890.86]  produce
[2890.86 --> 2891.34]  a
[2891.34 --> 2891.72]  new
[2891.72 --> 2892.28]  kind
[2892.28 --> 2892.44]  of
[2892.44 --> 2892.72]  man
[2892.72 --> 2893.50]  it's
[2893.50 --> 2893.66]  not
[2893.66 --> 2893.84]  like
[2893.84 --> 2894.18]  teaching
[2894.18 --> 2894.36]  a
[2894.36 --> 2894.56]  horse
[2894.56 --> 2894.72]  to
[2894.72 --> 2894.92]  jump
[2894.92 --> 2895.26]  better
[2895.26 --> 2895.44]  and
[2895.44 --> 2895.76]  better
[2895.76 --> 2896.52]  but
[2896.52 --> 2896.72]  like
[2896.72 --> 2897.02]  turning
[2897.02 --> 2897.28]  a
[2897.28 --> 2897.80]  horse
[2897.80 --> 2898.44]  into

[2898.68 --> 2899.14]  winged
[2899.14 --> 2899.82]  creature
[2899.82 --> 2901.50]  right
[2901.50 --> 2901.76]  it's a
[2901.76 --> 2901.98]  beautiful
[2901.98 --> 2902.40]  image
[2902.40 --> 2904.32]  this
[2904.32 --> 2905.18]  new
[2905.18 --> 2906.06]  life
[2906.06 --> 2906.46]  that we
[2906.46 --> 2906.66]  have
[2906.66 --> 2906.76]  we're
[2906.76 --> 2906.90]  not
[2906.90 --> 2907.10]  the
[2907.10 --> 2907.36]  same
[2907.36 --> 2907.54]  as
[2907.54 --> 2907.68]  we
[2907.68 --> 2907.82]  were
[2907.82 --> 2908.08]  before
[2908.08 --> 2908.38]  there's
[2908.38 --> 2908.54]  a
[2908.54 --> 2909.46]  break
[2909.46 --> 2909.72]  there's
[2909.72 --> 2909.84]  a
[2909.84 --> 2910.22]  complete
[2910.22 --> 2911.20]  transformation
[2911.20 --> 2912.74]  there's
[2912.74 --> 2912.84]  a
[2912.84 --> 2913.10]  story
[2913.10 --> 2913.34]  about
[2913.34 --> 2913.58]  St.
[2913.66 --> 2914.14]  Augustine
[2914.14 --> 2914.38]  one of
[2914.38 --> 2914.46]  the
[2914.46 --> 2914.76]  early
[2914.76 --> 2915.16]  church
[2915.16 --> 2915.62]  fathers
[2915.62 --> 2916.76]  before
[2916.76 --> 2917.06]  his
[2917.06 --> 2917.50]  conversion
[2917.50 --> 2917.72]  to

[3165.70 --> 3166.54]  but
[3166.54 --> 3166.62]  it's
[3166.62 --> 3166.74]  not
[3166.74 --> 3166.92]  just
[3166.92 --> 3167.14]  oh
[3167.14 --> 3167.32]  I'm
[3167.32 --> 3167.54]  sorry
[3167.54 --> 3167.72]  I
[3167.72 --> 3167.94]  sinned
[3167.94 --> 3168.04]  I

[3171.94 --> 3172.26]  whatever
[3172.26 --> 3172.66]  I'm not

[3172.96 --> 3173.24]  kill
[3173.24 --> 3173.44]  it
[3173.44 --> 3174.20]  so
[3174.20 --> 3174.44]  there's
[3174.44 --> 3174.84]  repentance
[3174.84 --> 3175.24]  but then

[3175.46 --> 3175.76]  faith
[3175.76 --> 3175.92]  where
[3185.50 --> 3185.86]  repentance
[3185.86 --> 3186.36]  means

[3200.60 --> 3201.02]  God
[3201.02 --> 3201.28]  doesn't

[3210.60 --> 3210.74]  our
[3210.74 --> 3211.14]  lives
[3211.14 --> 3212.14]  and we
[3212.14 --> 3212.46]  take as
[3212.46 --> 3212.72]  much
[3212.72 --> 3212.92]  as
[3212.92 --> 3213.16]  God
[3213.16 --> 3213.56]  has revealed
[3213.56 --> 3214.00]  of our
[3214.00 --> 3214.26]  sin
[3214.26 --> 3215.88]  and
[3215.88 --> 3216.84]  we
[3216.84 --> 3217.44]  give it
[3217.44 --> 3218.38]  to as
[3218.38 --> 3218.68]  much
[3218.68 --> 3219.22]  as
[3219.22 --> 3219.40]  we
[3219.40 --> 3219.80]  know
[3219.80 --> 3220.54]  to
[3220.54 --> 3220.92]  God
[3220.92 --> 3222.84]  we
[3222.84 --> 3223.10]  give
[3223.10 --> 3223.54]  as
[3223.54 --> 3224.04]  much
[3224.04 --> 3224.16]  of
[3224.16 --> 3224.50]  ourselves
[3224.50 --> 3224.70]  as
[3224.70 --> 3224.82]  we
[3224.82 --> 3225.00]  know
[3225.00 --> 3225.24]  every
[3225.24 --> 3225.52]  part
[3225.52 --> 3225.62]  of
[3225.62 --> 3225.94]  ourselves
[3225.94 --> 3226.12]  to
[3226.12 --> 3226.40]  God
[3226.40 --> 3227.18]  and
[3227.18 --> 3227.34]  so
[3227.34 --> 3227.98]  it's
[3227.98 --> 3228.84]  renouncing
[3228.84 --> 3229.04]  that
[3229.04 --> 3229.26]  not
[3229.26 --> 3229.48]  just
[3229.48 --> 3229.64]  our
[3229.64 --> 3230.18]  actions
[3230.18 --> 3230.92]  not
[3230.92 --> 3231.12]  just
[3231.12 --> 3231.32]  saying
[3231.32 --> 3231.48]  I
[3231.48 --> 3231.62]  was
[3231.62 --> 3232.04]  wrong
[3232.04 --> 3232.28]  to
[3232.28 --> 3232.58]  sin
[3232.58 --> 3232.98]  but
[3232.98 --> 3233.34]  saying
[3233.34 --> 3233.62]  God
[3233.62 --> 3233.82]  I
[3233.82 --> 3234.26]  turn
[3234.26 --> 3234.50]  from
[3234.50 --> 3235.04]  having
[3235.04 --> 3235.36]  a
[3235.36 --> 3235.64]  sinful
[3235.64 --> 3236.16]  heart
[3236.16 --> 3237.08]  God
[3237.08 --> 3237.24]  I
[3237.24 --> 3237.46]  turn
[3237.46 --> 3237.64]  from
[3237.64 --> 3237.90]  thinking
[3237.90 --> 3238.12]  that
[3238.12 --> 3238.34]  my
[3238.34 --> 3239.24]  desires
[3239.24 --> 3239.92]  that
[3239.92 --> 3240.20]  they're
[3240.20 --> 3240.78]  deceitful
[3240.78 --> 3241.32]  desires
[3241.32 --> 3242.00]  because
[3242.00 --> 3242.92]  they tell
[3242.92 --> 3243.08]  me
[3243.56 --> 3243.62]  we
[3243.62 --> 3244.20]  satisfied
[3244.20 --> 3245.08]  in
[3245.08 --> 3245.26]  these
[3245.26 --> 3245.92]  inordinate
[3245.92 --> 3246.66]  ways
[3246.66 --> 3246.92]  these
[3246.92 --> 3247.22]  ways
[3247.22 --> 3247.38]  that
[3247.38 --> 3247.54]  God
[3247.54 --> 3247.68]  did
[3247.68 --> 3247.82]  not
[3247.82 --> 3248.18]  design
[3248.18 --> 3248.36]  us
[3248.36 --> 3248.50]  to
[3248.50 --> 3248.76]  be
[3248.76 --> 3250.16]  that's
[3250.16 --> 3250.28]  why
[3250.28 --> 3250.44]  they're
[3250.44 --> 3250.96]  deceitful
[3250.96 --> 3251.42]  and we
[3251.42 --> 3252.02]  confess
[3252.02 --> 3252.28]  and we
[3252.28 --> 3252.82]  turn away
[3252.82 --> 3253.04]  from
[3253.04 --> 3253.24]  these
[3253.24 --> 3253.76]  desires
[3253.76 --> 3254.82]  that we
[3254.82 --> 3254.98]  think
[3254.98 --> 3255.14]  will
[3255.14 --> 3255.58]  satisfy
[3255.58 --> 3256.02]  us
[3256.02 --> 3256.74]  and
[3256.74 --> 3257.04]  instead
[3257.04 --> 3257.28]  we
[3257.28 --> 3257.58]  turn
[3257.58 --> 3257.82]  and we
[3257.82 --> 3258.12]  trust
[3258.12 --> 3258.30]  in
[3258.30 --> 3258.60]  God
[3258.60 --> 3259.76]  so
[3259.76 --> 3260.02]  friends
[3260.02 --> 3260.32]  can I
[3260.32 --> 3260.74]  encourage

[3273.96 --> 3274.30]  we can
[3274.30 --> 3274.48]  have
[3274.48 --> 3275.02]  confidence
[3275.02 --> 3275.34]  to
[3275.34 --> 3275.70]  repent
[3275.70 --> 3276.44]  we can
[3276.44 --> 3276.56]  have
[3276.56 --> 3276.98]  confidence
[3276.98 --> 3278.08]  because
[3278.08 --> 3278.90]  just like
[3278.90 --> 3279.04]  a
[3279.04 --> 3279.52]  construction
[3279.52 --> 3279.98]  site
[3279.98 --> 3281.20]  when the
[3281.20 --> 3281.66]  construction
[3281.66 --> 3282.20]  is going
[3282.20 --> 3282.56]  on
[3282.56 --> 3282.74]  they're
[3282.74 --> 3283.02]  building
[3283.02 --> 3283.20]  this
[3283.20 --> 3283.40]  big
[3283.40 --> 3283.80]  building
[3283.80 --> 3284.28]  what do
[3284.28 --> 3284.64]  they do
[3284.64 --> 3285.78]  they cover
[3285.78 --> 3285.96]  that
[3285.96 --> 3286.36]  construction
[3286.36 --> 3286.90]  site
[3286.90 --> 3288.04]  with boards
[3288.04 --> 3289.24]  or tarps

[3290.20 --> 3290.66]  covered
[3290.66 --> 3291.22]  walkways
[3291.22 --> 3291.64]  and so
[3291.64 --> 3292.02]  it is
[3292.02 --> 3292.38]  safe
[3292.38 --> 3293.58]  and
[3293.58 --> 3294.00]  likewise
[3294.00 --> 3294.90]  the
[3294.90 --> 3295.40]  continual

[3306.82 --> 3307.08]  to
[3307.08 --> 3307.44]  him
[3307.44 --> 3308.32]  because
[3308.32 --> 3308.56]  we're

[3312.68 --> 3313.06]  does
[3313.06 --> 3313.40]  this
[3313.40 --> 3314.04]  continual

[3317.06 --> 3317.28]  friends
[3317.28 --> 3317.64]  when we

[3327.66 --> 3327.76]  is
[3327.76 --> 3327.92]  what
[3327.92 --> 3328.10]  God

[3527.02 --> 3527.42]  righteousness
[3527.42 --> 3527.76]  that
[3527.76 --> 3528.08]  God
[3528.08 --> 3528.32]  had

[3535.26 --> 3535.68]  to
[3535.68 --> 3536.10]  die
[3536.10 --> 3536.98]  because
[3536.98 --> 3537.28]  of

[3537.56 --> 3537.88]  wrath

[3541.76 --> 3542.04]  not
[3542.04 --> 3542.54]  glorifying

[3878.92 --> 3883.36]  This is a local ministry that provides care for the vulnerable and the homeless.
[3883.94 --> 3885.48]  And so that's our designated ministry.
[3885.62 --> 3892.64]  And also, of course, as members of the church, we give regularly to our own church budget and our own ministries and mission that we have here.
[3893.02 --> 3896.88]  So I'll invite the deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[3898.64 --> 3928.62]  Thank you.
[3928.64 --> 3944.00]  And the deacons to come forward andного to the

[4005.00 --> 4006.00]  Amen.
[4006.00 --> 4007.00]  Amen.
[4007.00 --> 4008.00]  Amen.
[4008.00 --> 4009.00]  Amen.
[4009.00 --> 4010.00]  Amen.
[4010.00 --> 4011.00]  Amen.
[4011.00 --> 4012.00]  Amen.
[4012.00 --> 4013.00]  Amen.
[4013.00 --> 4021.00]  Let's also worship the Lord by responding to him with his prayer of supplication, where
[4021.00 --> 4024.00]  we bring to him our own needs and the needs of the world.
[4024.00 --> 4025.00]  Let's pray together.
[4025.00 --> 4027.00]  Please join me in prayer.
[4027.00 --> 4033.00]  Heavenly Father, you give us life and breath and every good thing.
[4033.00 --> 4042.00]  And as we enter into a new season, we remember your faithfulness in your unchanging nature,
[4042.00 --> 4044.00]  that you remain the same.
[4044.00 --> 4052.00]  You are the same yesterday, today, and forever, a God constant in love, faithfulness, and mercy.
[4052.00 --> 4058.00]  And so we come to you this morning with assurance of your covenant love for us.
[4058.00 --> 4064.00]  And Father, we pray for the community you have placed us in, the city of Delta, Ladner, North
[4064.00 --> 4065.00]  Delta, Swanson.
[4065.00 --> 4067.00]  You know each person in this community.
[4067.00 --> 4071.00]  Father, you know their stories, their circumstances.
[4071.00 --> 4074.00]  You know their hearts and their troubles.
[4074.00 --> 4081.00]  So we ask, Lord, that people in this community would come to know you as their creator and
[4081.00 --> 4086.00]  their loving Father through faith in Christ our Lord.
[4086.00 --> 4094.00]  Empower each of us in this congregation, Lord, to reach out to those around us who need
[4094.00 --> 4096.00]  to know who Jesus is.
[4096.00 --> 4103.00]  Lord, help us to befriend them, to welcome them, to know the gospel, to know Christ.
[4103.00 --> 4109.00]  Lord, we pray for those in our own church, and we ask that you would make us into a family of Christ.
[4109.00 --> 4117.00]  Thank you for the way that you have made us to desire community and friendship with others.
[4117.00 --> 4124.00]  Father, we grieve that living in a broken world means that these desires and needs can be left unmet,
[4124.00 --> 4133.00]  and we can be left unsatisfied and hurting by loneliness and, Lord, lack of connection that you have made us for.
[4133.00 --> 4138.00]  So, Lord, help us first to seek our ultimate joy and satisfaction in you alone.
[4138.00 --> 4145.00]  But also help us as a family of believers to care for one another, to serve one another in our midst,
[4145.00 --> 4150.00]  to encourage one another in the gospel, to reach outside of our own comfort zones, our own circles,
[4150.00 --> 4159.00]  and welcome newcomers, as well as longtime members of our community who still may feel lonely.
[4159.00 --> 4166.00]  Lord, to reach out to those shut-ins and those who are not able to gather with us weekly.
[4166.00 --> 4172.00]  Lord, we pray for also some of the ministries that are ramping up again after the summer break.
[4172.00 --> 4175.00]  Lord, we pray for cadets and gems.
[4175.00 --> 4179.00]  We pray that you would bring children of our community to come and be part of these ministries.
[4179.00 --> 4185.00]  Lord, to develop into Christian character and maturity, to know Christ.
[4185.00 --> 4190.00]  Father, we pray for our friendship club and our outreach to these friends
[4190.00 --> 4195.00]  and this club that provides community and belonging to them.
[4195.00 --> 4202.00]  Father, we pray for the men's breakfast, for cross training, also starting next week.
[4202.00 --> 4206.00]  And Lord, we especially pray that you would help us build up our small group ministry,
[4206.00 --> 4210.00]  so that we can all find community and friendship in the body of Christ.
[4210.00 --> 4216.00]  Father, we thank you that you care about our needs and the needs that each one of us have,
[4216.00 --> 4221.00]  and so we lift up a few of our particular needs in our church community.
[4221.00 --> 4223.00]  Lord, we pray for Quinn.
[4223.00 --> 4231.00]  Lord, we thank you that he is now home and that there is hope, that there is hope for recovery.
[4231.00 --> 4239.00]  But Lord, we also know that it's going to be a long road of restoring broken bones and broken nerves.
[4239.00 --> 4245.00]  Lord, we especially pray for the nerves in his hand, Lord, that he would be able to recover full movement of his hand.
[4245.00 --> 4259.00]  And Lord, just be with his new wife, his family, as they seek to support him and even feel the turmoil, the confusion of what has happened.
[4259.00 --> 4262.00]  Lord, would you bring your physical and spiritual healing to him.
[4262.00 --> 4268.00]  Father, we also pray for John, the brother of Lena, who has had surgery.
[4268.00 --> 4274.00]  Lord, we pray that you would bring healing into his body.
[4274.00 --> 4281.00]  But also, would you bring your spiritual comfort and presence to him and to his family,
[4281.00 --> 4284.00]  as they wait to hear what else can be done.
[4284.00 --> 4287.00]  Lord, would you bring your comfort.
[4287.00 --> 4294.00]  And Father, we pray for the family of Martin and Anne, with the passing of Barry, their Anne's brother-in-law.
[4294.00 --> 4300.00]  Lord, we pray that you would also just bring your comfort to the family.
[4300.00 --> 4303.00]  For all those who grieve, would you bind up their hearts.
[4303.00 --> 4308.00]  And would they, Lord, know of your love for them even in this moment.
[4308.00 --> 4315.00]  But we thank you, Lord, that Barry knew you and that he died peacefully with words of hymns on his lips.
[4315.00 --> 4318.00]  Father, we thank you for that great blessing.
[4318.00 --> 4325.00]  Father, we not only pray for people in our congregation, but Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters around the world.
[4325.00 --> 4330.00]  And Lord, I want to pray especially today for your people in the country of Iran.
[4330.00 --> 4339.00]  Lord, we pray that we thank you, Lord, for what you are doing amongst the Iranian people to bring so many to come to know you.
[4339.00 --> 4344.00]  Lord, the church is exploding there, but even doing so under much persecution.
[4344.00 --> 4347.00]  Father, we pray that you keep your people safe.
[4347.00 --> 4351.00]  And at the same time, you would provide for the needs of the churches.
[4351.00 --> 4353.00]  Lord, pastors to be trained.
[4353.00 --> 4355.00]  Your people to be discipled.
[4355.00 --> 4361.00]  Lord, we pray also for Iranians who have come and immigrated to Canada and who live here.
[4361.00 --> 4368.00]  Lord, we pray for the Iranian church, the Persian speaking church, even here in Vancouver and Delta.
[4368.00 --> 4371.00]  I mean in North Vancouver.
[4371.00 --> 4380.00]  We pray for Elam ministries in particular, Lord, who work amongst the Iranian people to translate Bibles, to provide training and materials.
[4380.00 --> 4383.00]  Lord, we just praise you for what you're doing.
[4383.00 --> 4398.00]  And Lord, we also pray, Lord, for the freedom of your gospel to go forth, for the freedom of hearts to turn to you in faith, not to be hindered by restrictions from earthly rulers.
[4398.00 --> 4409.00]  Lord, so many things that we can pray for, but Lord, for these that you've put on our hearts this morning, Lord, we especially ask for your grace.
[4409.00 --> 4412.00]  Because you care about each of these things that we prayed.
[4412.00 --> 4415.00]  And so we do so in confidence of who you are.
[4415.00 --> 4418.00]  We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[4418.00 --> 4424.00]  Now friends, let's all rise. Let's stand and that we go out with the benediction.
[4424.00 --> 4429.00]  So again, I invite you to join us for a time of fellowship, for coffee, right in the fellowship hall.
[4429.00 --> 4432.00]  And then next Sunday, join us for our barbecue.
[4432.00 --> 4438.00]  So our lava fall barbecue next Sunday, right after our worship service, September 25th.
[4438.00 --> 4442.00]  One more announcement.
[4442.00 --> 4444.00]  I forgot to mention earlier, but I thought of I was praying.
[4444.00 --> 4447.00]  Cross training is starting up on next Sunday.
[4447.00 --> 4454.00]  So we're having a class, an adult education class on the book of the Psalms, especially how we can draw close to God through the Psalms.
[4454.00 --> 4455.00]  That's for everybody.
[4455.00 --> 4458.00]  Starts at 930 and you can sign up.
[4458.00 --> 4459.00]  Anybody can come.
[4459.00 --> 4461.00]  If you think to sign up, go ahead and do so.
[4461.00 --> 4465.00]  But even if you don't sign up, you may still show up at 930.
[4465.00 --> 4471.00]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[4471.00 --> 4474.00]  Friends, the Lord bless you and keep you.
[4474.00 --> 4478.00]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4478.00 --> 4482.00]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[4482.00 --> 4483.00]  Amen.
