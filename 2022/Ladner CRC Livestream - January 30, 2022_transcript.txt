[18.84 --> 19.84]  Amen.
[48.84 --> 50.84]  Amen.
[78.84 --> 80.84]  Amen.
[108.84 --> 110.84]  Amen.
[138.84 --> 140.84]  Amen.

[198.84 --> 200.84]  Amen.
[228.84 --> 230.84]  Amen.
[258.84 --> 260.84]  Amen.
[288.84 --> 290.84]  Amen.
[318.84 --> 320.84]  Amen.
[320.84 --> 323.70]  I ran out of time to play notes.
[324.38 --> 325.12]  Good morning, everyone.
[326.12 --> 327.34]  Nice to see you here.
[327.68 --> 331.38]  We have a sizable crowd for COVID times, and it's good to see you here.
[331.50 --> 337.48]  If you're coming in from home on a live stream, it's good to see you here as well.
[337.56 --> 341.14]  And thank you for visiting us this morning, especially if you're not a member of our church
[341.14 --> 342.32]  but you're just checking in.
[342.58 --> 342.88]  Welcome.
[343.52 --> 344.38]  I'm John Smith.
[344.50 --> 345.86]  I'm the worship leader this morning.
[345.86 --> 353.96]  Later, Pastor Jason Trull will bring a message continuing through the Lord's Prayer this week,
[354.36 --> 355.54]  Your Kingdom Come.
[356.32 --> 360.28]  Paul Kemp and I chose a couple of tunes that are sort of related to prayer.
[360.44 --> 363.90]  Many of you will know the tune, In the Garden, I Come to the Garden Alone.
[364.06 --> 369.18]  It's a definite song focusing on intimate and close prayer with God.
[369.28 --> 370.62]  We'll hear more about that this morning.
[370.62 --> 378.74]  And, of course, Just a Closer Walk with you is a tune that all of you, I think, know and wish you could be singing.
[378.94 --> 380.72]  Well, hold on a minute, and you will.
[381.08 --> 383.84]  All right.
[383.92 --> 395.58]  In addition to the sermon on prayer this morning, Jason later on is continuing a Zoom joining with people this Sunday.
[395.58 --> 404.34]  So during this sermon series on learning how to pray, you're all invited to join him each Sunday evening at 7 p.m. on Zoom
[404.34 --> 408.46]  to discuss and practice praying each petition of the Lord's Prayer.
[408.90 --> 412.12]  That Zoom link was sent out in the Weekly Connections email,
[412.54 --> 418.26]  and you're welcome to join him at 7 o'clock this evening to continue what he's doing this morning.
[418.26 --> 423.52]  Our offering today is for the cadet organization.
[425.72 --> 431.20]  This is a boys club where the boys from our church and outside this church meet with adult leaders.
[431.44 --> 436.78]  Cadets is a place where the boys learn about the Bible, discipline, woodworking, and games.
[437.50 --> 442.60]  Once again, you can make a donation not during the service today,
[442.60 --> 447.24]  but with the envelopes that are provided for you, and you can drop them off at church,
[447.36 --> 451.06]  you can mail them in, you can drop them in the box in the back,
[451.16 --> 453.16]  and I think by now you do know the drill.
[454.12 --> 459.62]  The cadets couldn't be here with us this morning in their uniforms and so forth,
[459.74 --> 464.00]  but they're coming to us via an active video this morning,
[464.00 --> 466.88]  and this is the time in which we're going to hear about Doug Van Rijn
[466.88 --> 470.90]  as he shows us what the cadet club has been doing for the last while.
[486.40 --> 488.48]  Cadets, slow to the cadet play.
[489.84 --> 491.40]  Cadets, recite your play.
[492.34 --> 494.76]  Thankful to Jehovah for his gifts to me.
[494.76 --> 502.32]  I plan for myself to be ready to serve God, my parents, my Catholic, my church, my neighbor, and my home.
[502.32 --> 503.32]  I plan for myself to be in control.
[503.72 --> 504.32]  Thank you.
[504.54 --> 504.60]  Amen.
[505.32 --> 506.14]  takich Georgie Heavenly boy.
[506.14 --> 507.02]  Right now, I'm going to go to bring a land of Christ and honor here.
[507.46 --> 511.24]  Thank you very much, nac is us.
[517.68 --> 519.72]  I hope you will.
[526.72 --> 527.96]  Thank you.
[528.02 --> 528.32]  Amen.
[528.32 --> 558.30]  Thank you.
[558.32 --> 588.30]  Thank you.
[588.32 --> 618.30]  Thank you.
[618.32 --> 620.32]  Thank you.
[620.32 --> 622.32]  Thank you.
[622.32 --> 624.32]  Thank you.
[624.32 --> 626.32]  Thank you.
[626.32 --> 628.32]  Thank you.
[628.32 --> 630.32]  Thank you.
[630.32 --> 638.32]  Thank you.
[638.32 --> 640.32]  Thank you.
[640.32 --> 642.32]  Thank you.
[642.32 --> 644.32]  Thank you.
[644.32 --> 646.32]  Thank you.
[646.32 --> 648.32]  Thank you.
[648.32 --> 650.32]  Thank you.
[650.32 --> 652.32]  Thank you.
[652.32 --> 654.32]  Thank you.
[654.32 --> 656.32]  Thank you.
[656.32 --> 658.32]  Thank you.
[658.32 --> 660.32]  Thank you.
[660.32 --> 662.32]  Thank you.
[662.32 --> 664.32]  Thank you.
[664.32 --> 666.32]  Thank you.
[666.32 --> 668.32]  Thank you.
[668.32 --> 670.32]  Thank you.
[670.32 --> 672.32]  Thank you.
[672.32 --> 674.32]  Thank you.
[674.32 --> 676.32]  Thank you.
[676.32 --> 678.32]  Thank you.
[678.32 --> 680.32]  Thank you.
[680.32 --> 682.32]  Thank you.
[682.32 --> 684.32]  Thank you.
[684.32 --> 686.32]  Thank you.
[686.32 --> 688.32]  Thank you.
[688.32 --> 690.32]  Thank you.
[690.32 --> 692.32]  Thank you.
[692.32 --> 694.32]  Thank you.
[694.32 --> 696.32]  Thank you.
[696.32 --> 698.32]  Thank you.
[698.32 --> 700.32]  Thank you.
[700.32 --> 702.32]  Thank you.
[702.32 --> 704.32]  Thank you.
[704.32 --> 706.32]  Thank you.
[706.32 --> 708.32]  Thank you.
[708.32 --> 710.32]  Thank you.
[710.32 --> 712.32]  Thank you.
[712.32 --> 714.32]  Thank you.
[722.32 --> 724.32]  Thank you.
[724.32 --> 726.32]  Thank you.
[726.32 --> 728.32]  Thank you.
[728.32 --> 729.32]  Thank you.
[731.32 --> 733.32]  Thank you.
[733.32 --> 736.32]  Thank you.
[736.32 --> 740.32]  Thank you.
[740.32 --> 770.30]  Thank you.
[770.32 --> 798.86]  I am weak, but thou art strong. Jesus, keep me from all wrong. I'll be satisfied as long as I walk. Let me walk close to thee.
[798.86 --> 806.62]  Just a closer walk with thee.
[806.62 --> 812.62]  Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[812.62 --> 828.38]  Let me walk close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[828.38 --> 843.38]  Through this world of toil and snares. If I falter, Lord, who cares?
[843.38 --> 850.94]  Though with thee my burden shares.
[851.38 --> 857.38]  None but thee, dear Lord, none but thee.
[857.38 --> 865.38]  Just a closer walk with thee.
[865.38 --> 873.38]  Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[873.38 --> 875.38]  Dear Lord, let it be.
[875.38 --> 883.38]  Dear Lord, let it be.
[883.38 --> 888.38]  Dear Lord, let it be.
[888.38 --> 903.38]  When my feeble life is warm, Time for me will be no more.
[903.38 --> 911.38]  Guide me gently, save me o'er.
[911.38 --> 917.38]  To thy kingdom shore, To thy shore.
[917.38 --> 927.38]  Just a closer walk with thee.
[927.38 --> 929.38]  Just a closer walk with thee.
[929.38 --> 933.38]  Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[933.38 --> 934.38]  Granted, Jesus is my plea.
[934.38 --> 935.38]  Let it be.
[935.38 --> 936.38]  Let it be.
[936.38 --> 940.38]  Daily walking close to thee.
[940.38 --> 941.38]  Let it be.
[941.38 --> 945.38]  Let it be.
[945.38 --> 950.38]  Dear Lord, let it be.
[950.38 --> 972.38]  I have a maker.
[972.38 --> 977.38]  I have a maker.
[977.38 --> 984.38]  Before my God.
[984.38 --> 995.38]  Before even time began, My life was in his hand.
[995.38 --> 997.38]  He knows my name.
[997.38 --> 1001.38]  He knows my name.
[1001.38 --> 1007.38]  He knows my every thought.
[1007.38 --> 1018.38]  He sees each tear that falls, And hears me when I call.
[1018.38 --> 1021.38]  I have a father.
[1021.38 --> 1024.38]  I have a father.
[1024.38 --> 1030.38]  He calls me his home.
[1030.38 --> 1035.38]  He'll never leave me.
[1035.38 --> 1040.38]  No matter where I go.
[1040.38 --> 1047.38]  He knows my name.
[1047.38 --> 1048.38]  He knows my every thought.
[1048.38 --> 1050.38]  He knows my every thought.
[1050.38 --> 1064.38]  He sees each tear that falls, And hears me when I call.
[1064.38 --> 1069.38]  He knows my name.
[1069.38 --> 1071.38]  He knows my every thought.
[1071.38 --> 1086.38]  He sees each tear that falls, And hears me when I call.
[1086.38 --> 1091.38]  He hears me when I call.
[1091.38 --> 1094.62]  when I come.
[1114.58 --> 1120.58]  Faithful one, so I'm changing.
[1121.38 --> 1133.38]  Faithful one, your God, I run the way.
[1133.38 --> 1143.38]  Lord of all, I depend on you.
[1143.38 --> 1155.38]  I call out to you again and again.
[1155.38 --> 1167.38]  I call out to you again and again.
[1167.38 --> 1177.38]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[1177.38 --> 1187.38]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[1187.38 --> 1203.38]  All through the storm, your love is the anchor.
[1203.38 --> 1211.38]  My hope is in you alone.
[1211.38 --> 1229.38]  Faithful one, so I'm changing.
[1229.38 --> 1241.38]  Faithful one, you're my rock of peace.
[1241.38 --> 1243.38]  Faithful one, your God, I run the way.
[1243.38 --> 1245.38]  Faithful one, your God, I run the way.
[1245.38 --> 1247.38]  Faithful one, your God, I run the way.
[1247.38 --> 1254.38]  I depend on you.
[1255.22 --> 1266.38]  I call out to you again and again.
[1266.38 --> 1276.38]  I call unto you again and again.
[1276.38 --> 1287.38]  You are my rock in times of trouble.
[1287.38 --> 1296.38]  You lift me up when I fall down.
[1296.38 --> 1311.38]  All through the storm your love is the anchor.
[1311.38 --> 1324.38]  My hope is in you alone.
[1324.38 --> 1326.38]  You may be seated.
[1326.38 --> 1340.38]  At this point, ages 3 through grade 7, if you fall in this category, you are a child.
[1340.38 --> 1359.38]  And you are dismissed for Kids Life Children's Worship at this time.
[1359.38 --> 1362.38]  That's a good share of our audience.
[1362.38 --> 1366.38]  That's not a bad thing.
[1366.38 --> 1374.38]  For our time of confession and assurance, I've chosen some selections based on Psalm 51 and Psalm 103.
[1374.38 --> 1385.38]  Psalm 51 is very confessional, which reminds us of our sins, and Psalm 103 is much more upbeat, reminding us of God's assurance of pardon.
[1385.38 --> 1389.38]  Why is that? David wrote both of those psalms.
[1389.38 --> 1398.38]  Psalm 51, however, was written shortly after Nathan the prophet had visited him and explained to him that he was not doing the right thing with Bathsheba.
[1398.38 --> 1403.38]  He recognized that and was very confessional when he wrote this psalm.
[1403.38 --> 1412.38]  So we'll go back and forth where I read portions of Psalm 51 and then you reassure me with the text of 103.
[1412.38 --> 1416.38]  You'll see the double arrows as being your portion.
[1416.38 --> 1418.38]  Psalm 51 says,
[1418.38 --> 1423.38]  Have mercy upon me, O God, because of your unfailing love.
[1423.38 --> 1428.38]  Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins.
[1428.38 --> 1431.38]  Our God is merciful and iniquity.
[1431.38 --> 1437.38]  Those who get angry and hold us together, my God.
[1437.38 --> 1441.38]  Wash me from my guilt.
[1441.38 --> 1443.38]  Purify me from my sin.
[1443.38 --> 1445.38]  For I recognize my shameful deeds.
[1445.38 --> 1448.38]  They haunt me day and night.
[1448.38 --> 1451.38]  But I will not haunt me and use of us.
[1451.38 --> 1455.38]  Nor will I be angry forever.
[1455.38 --> 1459.38]  Against you and you alone have I sinned.
[1459.38 --> 1461.38]  I have done what is evil in your sight.
[1461.38 --> 1469.38]  You will be proved right in what you say and your judgment against me is just.
[1469.38 --> 1473.38]  O God is not my love for all our sins.
[1473.38 --> 1477.38]  Nor have we healed us and have we heard.
[1477.38 --> 1480.38]  For if I have the heavens of our fathers,
[1480.38 --> 1484.38]  so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1484.38 --> 1487.38]  And as far as the years of the bloodline,
[1487.38 --> 1491.38]  so great is my love for all our sins.
[1491.38 --> 1497.38]  I was born a sinner from the moment my mother conceived me.
[1497.38 --> 1501.38]  But I was like a father to the children,
[1501.38 --> 1503.38]  and her hands of the past,
[1503.38 --> 1505.38]  and those who fear him.
[1505.38 --> 1508.38]  For if I understand how weak we are,
[1508.38 --> 1512.38]  you remember it that we are among the light.
[1512.38 --> 1515.38]  You desire honesty from the heart.
[1515.38 --> 1519.38]  Teach me to be wise in my inmost being.
[1519.38 --> 1522.38]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
[1522.38 --> 1525.38]  and make me willing to obey you.
[1525.38 --> 1530.38]  The love of the Lord be made forever.
[1530.38 --> 1531.38]  To those who fear him,
[1531.38 --> 1536.38]  the salvation and thanks to your children and children.
[1536.38 --> 1539.38]  Of those who are faithful to your God.
[1539.38 --> 1542.38]  Those who will pay you to the man.
[1542.38 --> 1546.38]  The sacrifice you want is a broken spirit,
[1546.38 --> 1549.38]  a broken and contrite heart, O God,
[1549.38 --> 1551.38]  you will not despise.
[1551.38 --> 1555.38]  Our God is merciful and gracious.
[1555.38 --> 1558.38]  Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[1558.38 --> 1564.38]  Our song, sorry.
[1564.38 --> 1566.38]  Our song's response is,
[1566.38 --> 1568.38]  I lift my eyes up.
[1568.38 --> 1582.38]  To the mountains,
[1582.38 --> 1587.38]  Where does my help come from?
[1587.38 --> 1602.38]  My help comes from you,
[1602.38 --> 1605.38]  Maker of heaven,
[1605.38 --> 1612.38]  Creator of the earth.
[1612.38 --> 1615.38]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1615.38 --> 1618.38]  You are my only hope.
[1618.38 --> 1624.38]  You're my only prayer.
[1624.38 --> 1627.38]  So I will wait for you,
[1627.38 --> 1631.38]  To come and rescue me.
[1631.38 --> 1637.38]  Come and give me life.
[1637.38 --> 1640.38]  I lift my eyes up.
[1640.38 --> 1641.38]  I lift my eyes up.
[1641.38 --> 1643.38]  To the mountains,
[1643.38 --> 1649.38]  Where does my help come from?
[1649.38 --> 1652.38]  My help comes from you,
[1652.38 --> 1655.38]  Maker of heaven,
[1655.38 --> 1662.38]  Creator of the earth.
[1662.38 --> 1665.38]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1665.38 --> 1666.38]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1666.38 --> 1668.38]  You are my only hope.
[1668.38 --> 1671.38]  You're my only prayer.
[1671.38 --> 1675.38]  You are my only prayer.
[1675.38 --> 1678.38]  So I will wait for you,
[1678.38 --> 1680.38]  To come and rescue me.
[1680.38 --> 1684.38]  Come and give me life.
[1684.38 --> 1690.38]  I lift my eyes up.
[1690.38 --> 1693.38]  To the mountains,
[1693.38 --> 1699.38]  Where does my help come from?
[1699.38 --> 1715.38]  O, how I need you, Lord.
[1715.38 --> 1717.38]  Would you please pray with me?
[1717.38 --> 1729.84]  we thank you father son and spirit that you are a god who loves and you are a god who brings renewal
[1729.84 --> 1737.46]  in new life so father we pray that your spirit would now come on us as we turn to the reading
[1737.46 --> 1745.54]  and the preaching of your word that you would bring your newness to us even now that we would
[1745.54 --> 1755.34]  not walk away unchanged but that we would respond to you with obedience and love holy spirit be among
[1755.34 --> 1763.94]  us and be at work we pray this in jesus name amen so during the season of epiphany we are in a sermon
[1763.94 --> 1772.18]  series as john already shared in this uh the lord's prayer from matthew chapter 6 you know and so jesus's
[1772.18 --> 1780.84]  disciples came up to him and they said lord teach us how to pray and jesus does he's gracious right he
[1780.84 --> 1791.14]  responds and he teaches us how to pray he teaches us to pray for those things that he that are on his
[1791.14 --> 1797.16]  heart he teaches us how to ask for those things that are most central to god's will and so what
[1797.16 --> 1801.48]  we're doing over the series is we're just walking through the lord's prayer bit by bit looking at
[1801.48 --> 1807.34]  each petition and one of the really amazing things about the lord's prayer is that this is the prayer
[1807.34 --> 1813.26]  of the global church right christians all of the world wherever they are they they pray we all pray
[1813.26 --> 1821.20]  we pray for our own families our own friends we pray for our own churches our own vocations in the
[1821.20 --> 1827.96]  world but all of god's children together we pray according to the way that the lord taught us to
[1827.96 --> 1832.88]  pray and so as a way a fun way to kind of symbolize that each week we're trying to have a different
[1832.88 --> 1839.06]  language read read for us as we read the lord's prayer together so today we'll invite mustafa to
[1839.06 --> 1842.42]  come up come on up and he will read for us in farsi
[1842.42 --> 1868.62]  i am reading chapter 6 10 to 13
[1868.62 --> 1895.84] Rs
[1895.84 --> 1916.98]  And we'll also read the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1917.90 --> 1920.48]  So today, question and answer number 23.
[1921.64 --> 1923.28]  What does the second request mean?
[1923.28 --> 1934.62]  Your kingdom come means rule us by your word and spirit in such a way that more and more we submit to you.
[1935.62 --> 1938.68]  Keep your church strong and add to it.
[1939.36 --> 1940.82]  Destroy the devil's work.
[1941.70 --> 1948.26]  Destroy every force which revolts against you and every conspiracy against your word.
[1948.26 --> 1958.82]  Do this until your kingdom is so complete and perfect that in it you are all in all.
[1958.82 --> 1965.64]  So I invite you actually, the Heidelberg Catechism is beautiful.
[1966.36 --> 1969.12]  And, you know, I'm sure a lot of you have it at home.
[1969.20 --> 1971.92]  And as we read through the Lord's Prayer, maybe just review it often.
[1972.70 --> 1978.24]  It really encapsulates so much of what these words mean, what Jesus is teaching us.
[1978.24 --> 1986.72]  So when Jesus teaches us to pray, one of the things He wants us to pray is,
[1987.54 --> 1988.28]  Your kingdom come.
[1989.08 --> 1990.18]  Your kingdom come.
[1990.70 --> 1993.38]  And that's what we're going to spend our time reflecting on this morning.
[1993.38 --> 2003.00]  Now, if we are going to pray this petition, Your kingdom come, in all of its fullness, in all that it means,
[2003.80 --> 2007.70]  well, we have to dive in to what the kingdom of God is.
[2008.30 --> 2009.36]  What are we praying for?
[2010.26 --> 2016.78]  And then we need to look at what it looks like for that kingdom to come and show up in our world.
[2017.68 --> 2019.44]  All right, so that's what I want us to look at this morning.
[2020.00 --> 2021.62]  First, what is the kingdom of God?
[2022.20 --> 2023.98]  What are we talking about here?
[2024.52 --> 2027.24]  And second, how does the kingdom of God come?
[2027.34 --> 2030.32]  How should we pray for the kingdom of God to come?
[2030.92 --> 2036.62]  So first, if we are to pray for God's kingdom to come, we must understand what it is.
[2037.24 --> 2042.78]  And when we read the Gospels, one of the things we discover is that over and over,
[2043.06 --> 2047.96]  Jesus' main message was the kingdom of God is at hand.
[2048.60 --> 2048.80]  Right?
[2048.80 --> 2051.76]  The kingdom of God is come.
[2052.94 --> 2057.86]  So this is how Mark begins his Gospel about Jesus.
[2058.64 --> 2064.54]  So in Mark chapter 1, right in the beginning of his Gospel, verses 14 to 15, it says this,
[2064.62 --> 2071.72]  After John was put in prison, Jesus went up to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
[2071.72 --> 2078.12]  The time has come, he said, the kingdom of God has come near.
[2078.86 --> 2081.38]  Repent and believe the good news.
[2081.38 --> 2084.74]  So let me ask you a question this morning.
[2085.78 --> 2096.32]  If you are a Christian, and if I were to say to you, hey friend, can you summarize the Gospel in a sentence or two?
[2097.06 --> 2098.34]  Right before we read this.
[2098.34 --> 2099.26]  What would you say?
[2099.26 --> 2100.42]  What would you say?
[2100.42 --> 2101.46]  How would you respond?
[2102.58 --> 2107.30]  I mean, I think probably what I would say would be something like this.
[2107.36 --> 2111.72]  Well, the Gospel is that you are a sinner, and Jesus died for your sins on the cross,
[2111.76 --> 2116.52]  and if you trust and believe in Jesus, you can be forgiven and go to heaven when you die.
[2116.52 --> 2123.50]  That's the way most of us have been trained to describe the Gospel.
[2124.60 --> 2127.70]  Now, everything I just said is true.
[2128.52 --> 2131.98]  It's all there in the Bible that we read.
[2133.24 --> 2135.88]  But is that what Jesus says here?
[2136.82 --> 2137.82]  The answer is no.
[2138.76 --> 2140.76]  Jesus says the kingdom of God has come near.
[2140.76 --> 2146.92]  According to Jesus, like literally from the mouth of Jesus, that is the Gospel.
[2147.08 --> 2150.64]  The good news, the kingdom of God has come near.
[2151.40 --> 2152.38]  That's the Gospel.
[2153.34 --> 2154.40]  So what is that, right?
[2154.46 --> 2155.60]  What does that mean?
[2156.54 --> 2159.52]  Well, it's actually something that we talk about here all the time.
[2159.52 --> 2167.20]  We talk all the time about this whole story, the grand, beautiful, wonderful story of the Bible.
[2167.84 --> 2170.28]  That God, in the beginning, created the world.
[2170.28 --> 2171.86]  Good and perfect.
[2172.68 --> 2179.42]  And how the world was meant to be with humans in creation flourishing under the reign of God.
[2180.02 --> 2180.44]  Right?
[2180.52 --> 2182.82]  Where God is our king.
[2183.82 --> 2187.08]  So in the first pages of the Bible, imagine.
[2188.36 --> 2194.60]  What we see is God's people in God's place under God's rule.
[2195.40 --> 2197.22]  That's the way God created things to be.
[2197.22 --> 2199.72]  And of course, we learn the tragedy of the story.
[2200.06 --> 2203.16]  That human beings rejected God's rule.
[2203.80 --> 2205.62]  We rejected God as king.
[2205.82 --> 2208.22]  And we decided we're going to rule ourselves.
[2208.48 --> 2209.00]  Take the crown.
[2209.36 --> 2210.08]  Put it on our heads.
[2210.62 --> 2211.58]  That's what we did.
[2212.24 --> 2214.08]  And how did that turn out for us?
[2217.80 --> 2219.32]  Not very well at all.
[2219.80 --> 2221.62]  We made a mess of the world.
[2221.62 --> 2223.76]  We make a mess of ourselves.
[2223.96 --> 2225.78]  We make a mess of our relationships.
[2227.16 --> 2233.82]  And yet, there is this promise throughout the whole Bible that one day God will return as the king.
[2234.08 --> 2235.38]  That he would come again.
[2235.82 --> 2237.40]  And the king will return.
[2237.56 --> 2239.92]  And he will restore his kingdom.
[2239.92 --> 2242.92]  So when Jesus shows up and he says,
[2243.38 --> 2245.04]  The time has come.
[2245.48 --> 2247.12]  The kingdom of God has come near.
[2247.46 --> 2248.10]  He's saying,
[2248.52 --> 2252.34]  The moment that we have all been waiting for and longing for,
[2252.42 --> 2254.74]  For the king to come and restore all things,
[2255.28 --> 2256.96]  Is now.
[2258.26 --> 2259.74]  I am the king.
[2260.30 --> 2262.70]  The kingdom has come near.
[2262.70 --> 2270.64]  Jesus is saying he's like a king who has been away from his kingdom,
[2270.78 --> 2271.54]  From his land.
[2271.64 --> 2275.96]  And he is finally returning to take back his throne.
[2276.52 --> 2280.12]  And to establish his rule and his kingship.
[2282.00 --> 2282.56]  Okay.
[2283.34 --> 2289.10]  Now the question on everyone's minds when they hear Jesus say this is,
[2289.10 --> 2292.74]  Well, what kind of king is he going to be?
[2293.88 --> 2294.10]  Right?
[2294.16 --> 2299.36]  What kind of rule is this king going to bring?
[2300.00 --> 2304.30]  Because in the ancient world, the enthronement of a new king or a new leader,
[2304.78 --> 2307.10]  It can be troubling business.
[2307.70 --> 2311.06]  It can cause much fear and anxiety.
[2311.96 --> 2315.20]  So when Jesus comes, he's proclaiming a new reign.
[2315.36 --> 2316.16]  Well, you know what?
[2316.36 --> 2318.34]  We've been there and done that, haven't we?
[2319.10 --> 2319.30]  Right?
[2319.36 --> 2324.28]  God's people have seen many kings come and go in their long history.
[2324.64 --> 2328.46]  The search for a true leader, a true judge, a good king.
[2329.12 --> 2331.56]  Well, that absorbs much of the history of God's people.
[2332.40 --> 2335.14]  And many of them have not ruled well.
[2337.00 --> 2340.22]  I don't know how many of you have seen the movie The Godfather.
[2341.08 --> 2344.12]  But if you haven't, go home and watch it.
[2344.12 --> 2349.36]  There's a scene at the end of the movie that captures this fear well.
[2350.38 --> 2355.68]  Michael Corleone stands in this ornate, beautiful Roman Catholic church.
[2355.80 --> 2358.00]  He's up in the front by the baptismal font.
[2359.12 --> 2361.42]  And it's his nephew's christening.
[2361.42 --> 2370.12]  And as the camera kind of shows him standing there, very serious and somber with his elegant Italian suit on,
[2370.64 --> 2377.02]  the camera also cuts to all these different scenes of assassinations that Michael has orchestrated,
[2377.40 --> 2381.32]  which are happening at the very same time as the baptism.
[2381.32 --> 2385.86]  And it turns out he's arranged to become the Bob Moss of New York.
[2386.46 --> 2391.78]  He's ascending to the throne by killing anyone who would stand in his way.
[2393.16 --> 2399.48]  And that fictional story is haunting enough, but similar stories happen in real life all the time.
[2400.14 --> 2402.06]  Up until today around the world.
[2402.06 --> 2408.06]  Perhaps Jesus' hearers would have remembered the words of the prophet Samuel.
[2409.02 --> 2410.42]  This is what Samuel says.
[2414.26 --> 2419.14]  This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights.
[2419.46 --> 2422.86]  He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses.
[2423.74 --> 2426.94]  And others to plow his ground and reap his harvest.
[2426.94 --> 2431.20]  And still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
[2432.06 --> 2436.34]  He will take your daughters to be his perfumers and cooks and bakers.
[2436.96 --> 2442.26]  He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.
[2442.94 --> 2449.34]  He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.
[2450.46 --> 2456.44]  Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys, he will take for his own.
[2456.44 --> 2459.16]  He will take a tenth of your flocks.
[2459.84 --> 2462.74]  And you yourselves will become his slaves.
[2463.12 --> 2466.30]  When that day comes, you will cry out for relief.
[2469.18 --> 2477.70]  See, the world of Jesus' day was sadly familiar with this sort of king and this sort of rule.
[2477.70 --> 2482.02]  The kingdom of God is at hand.
[2483.28 --> 2484.00]  Well, okay.
[2484.54 --> 2487.12]  What kind of rule will Jesus bring?
[2488.00 --> 2488.14]  Right?
[2488.18 --> 2491.86]  What kind of kingdom is he going to establish?
[2493.02 --> 2496.22]  Well, if we want to know what this kingdom of God is like,
[2497.40 --> 2499.30]  Jesus is the one who is announcing it.
[2499.34 --> 2499.44]  Right?
[2499.50 --> 2501.00]  Jesus is the one who is bringing it.
[2502.30 --> 2503.78]  He's the king of it.
[2503.78 --> 2508.40]  So if we look at his life, that's going to help us.
[2508.46 --> 2516.06]  It's going to show us how he lives out what this kingdom is, what it values, and what it does.
[2516.72 --> 2523.40]  So let's quickly do a skim look at Jesus' life so we can learn more about what is the kingdom of God.
[2524.22 --> 2532.74]  So Jesus, as he travels all around and on foot, by boat, what he does often is he heals.
[2533.78 --> 2534.00]  Right?
[2534.06 --> 2535.76]  Blind eyes are given sight.
[2536.40 --> 2540.14]  Lepers, their skin is restored as good as new.
[2541.10 --> 2542.84]  Paralytics, can they walk?
[2543.48 --> 2546.12]  Those oppressed by demons are set free.
[2546.76 --> 2549.58]  All sorts of ailments are undone.
[2549.58 --> 2552.44]  But he doesn't just heal.
[2552.80 --> 2553.74]  He also feeds.
[2554.64 --> 2554.76]  Right?
[2554.82 --> 2557.94]  He often has mercy on crowds who are simply hungry.
[2558.24 --> 2560.96]  They're far away from grocery stores of any kind.
[2561.54 --> 2564.10]  So he feeds them bread and fish.
[2564.78 --> 2568.74]  He makes huge jars of wine when a wedding party runs out.
[2570.82 --> 2572.18]  That's the kingdom of God.
[2572.18 --> 2574.78]  But he doesn't just feed.
[2575.14 --> 2576.08]  He also befriends.
[2577.08 --> 2577.20]  Right?
[2577.26 --> 2579.18]  He befriends all kinds of people.
[2579.98 --> 2581.14]  The wealthy and the powerful.
[2582.24 --> 2585.12]  Also the weak and the despised.
[2585.94 --> 2590.00]  He befriends the abused Samaritan woman at the well.
[2590.16 --> 2594.50]  And he befriends the chief leader of the Jewish law.
[2595.46 --> 2595.64]  Right?
[2595.64 --> 2598.82]  He befriends revolutionaries and tax collectors.
[2599.94 --> 2602.58]  Trades people and children.
[2604.14 --> 2605.92]  But he doesn't just befriend.
[2606.04 --> 2606.96]  He also forgives.
[2607.78 --> 2609.82]  He forgives a woman caught in adultery.
[2610.42 --> 2613.26]  He forgives best friends who betray him.
[2614.28 --> 2618.38]  He forgives the rich who have profited off of others.
[2619.44 --> 2620.52]  And he keeps telling people,
[2621.56 --> 2622.72]  leave your life of sin.
[2623.14 --> 2624.24]  Come and follow me.
[2624.24 --> 2626.00]  Go live a new life.
[2627.26 --> 2631.38]  But friends, he doesn't just heal and feed and befriend and forgive.
[2631.74 --> 2633.50]  He also dies.
[2634.94 --> 2635.08]  Right?
[2635.16 --> 2638.26]  And as the Roman Empire with, you know,
[2638.30 --> 2640.16]  its professional executioners,
[2640.20 --> 2642.06]  as they nail him to the cross, what do they do?
[2642.30 --> 2644.78]  They post this ironic sign above his head.
[2644.82 --> 2645.50]  And what does it say?
[2647.00 --> 2648.78]  King of the Jews.
[2649.86 --> 2654.02]  And this king who came announcing the good news of God's kingdom
[2654.02 --> 2658.48]  dies, naked and humiliated.
[2660.16 --> 2663.18]  And what happens on the cross, the scriptures tell us,
[2663.78 --> 2667.44]  is that this king becomes the lord of sorrows.
[2668.04 --> 2668.60]  Right?
[2668.64 --> 2672.20]  He takes upon himself all of the things that have gone wrong in the world.
[2672.20 --> 2677.24]  All of the stuff that is our fault because we rejected God as our king.
[2677.24 --> 2681.46]  All the brokenness and hurt in the world that we have brought.
[2682.00 --> 2685.02]  Jesus bore the penalty himself.
[2686.32 --> 2686.74]  Right?
[2686.80 --> 2690.34]  All of the anger and the clenched fists.
[2691.68 --> 2691.80]  Right?
[2691.84 --> 2694.38]  All of our doubt and our despair.
[2694.38 --> 2698.26]  All of our greed and our lust.
[2699.44 --> 2703.22]  All of our self-protection and our self-promotion.
[2703.22 --> 2708.84]  All of the meanness and the violence of human history.
[2709.78 --> 2711.62]  He receives the punishment for.
[2712.58 --> 2713.70]  And then he dies.
[2714.98 --> 2716.54]  But this king who died.
[2717.08 --> 2717.60]  Right?
[2717.64 --> 2718.78]  He is both fully human.
[2718.86 --> 2721.46]  So he can die the death that we deserve to die.
[2721.84 --> 2723.44]  But he is fully God.
[2723.44 --> 2725.60]  So death has no power over him.
[2726.34 --> 2728.00]  So Jesus rises from the dead.
[2728.62 --> 2732.00]  Conquering our enemies of sin and death.
[2732.22 --> 2734.50]  Vanquishing our foes for us.
[2734.92 --> 2735.84]  As our king.
[2737.26 --> 2740.04]  And that's why, friends, Jesus, as the true king,
[2740.22 --> 2743.38]  is able to take all of the wrongs and make them all right.
[2743.74 --> 2747.34]  He is to take all that is broken and make them whole again.
[2747.34 --> 2754.42]  He is able to take everything that is sad in this world and make it untrue.
[2755.58 --> 2758.06]  And that's why his kingship is good news.
[2758.72 --> 2760.02]  It's good news, he says.
[2762.18 --> 2765.08]  So if you want to know, what is the kingdom of God?
[2766.18 --> 2766.84]  What is it?
[2767.24 --> 2768.50]  Well, we must look to Jesus.
[2769.62 --> 2769.74]  Right?
[2769.98 --> 2770.90]  He's the king.
[2771.98 --> 2773.68]  And he teaches us to pray,
[2774.18 --> 2775.56]  Your kingdom come.
[2775.62 --> 2777.30]  And it's his kingdom that we pray for.
[2778.10 --> 2779.96]  And so that leads us to the second question this morning.
[2780.88 --> 2783.56]  Well, how does the kingdom of God come?
[2784.24 --> 2784.42]  Right?
[2784.46 --> 2786.06]  So we have an idea of what the kingdom is.
[2786.10 --> 2789.28]  It's the reign, the rule of Jesus.
[2789.78 --> 2790.92]  His kingship.
[2792.10 --> 2794.66]  Well then, how does it come?
[2796.46 --> 2798.66]  The first thing we need to realize is this.
[2799.48 --> 2802.14]  Jesus teaches us to pray,
[2803.00 --> 2804.54]  Your kingdom come.
[2805.50 --> 2811.64]  Because even though Jesus has ascended to the throne of God at the Father's right hand,
[2811.64 --> 2817.50]  And even though that right now he is ordering all things according to the good will and purposes of God,
[2817.84 --> 2824.10]  Yet, God's rule is not yet fully come in the way that we all long for it to come.
[2824.10 --> 2824.66]  Right?
[2824.66 --> 2832.26]  In the gospel, Jesus tells us all these parables to describe how the kingdom comes.
[2833.32 --> 2837.62]  So in Mark chapter 4, this is what Jesus tells us.
[2837.62 --> 2840.28]  What shall we say the kingdom of God is like?
[2840.34 --> 2842.36]  And what parable shall we use to describe it?
[2843.26 --> 2844.50]  It is like a mustard seed,
[2845.00 --> 2847.46]  Which is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,
[2848.00 --> 2849.94]  Yet when planted, it grows,
[2850.32 --> 2853.18]  And becomes the largest of all garden plants,
[2853.58 --> 2858.38]  With such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.
[2858.38 --> 2862.16]  Or as he puts it in another place,
[2862.84 --> 2864.62]  In the gospel of Matthew, he says,
[2865.34 --> 2867.62]  The kingdom of heaven is like yeast,
[2868.06 --> 2871.46]  That a woman took and mixed into about 60 pounds of flour,
[2871.84 --> 2875.26]  Until it worked all through the dough.
[2875.26 --> 2880.48]  See, God's rule is breaking into the world,
[2881.06 --> 2882.76]  But not all at once.
[2883.48 --> 2885.88]  The kingdom is something that has small beginnings,
[2886.50 --> 2887.64]  But then it grows,
[2887.86 --> 2889.96]  And it grows slowly and purposefully,
[2890.22 --> 2894.22]  Until at last it is brought to bear as far as the curse is found.
[2895.38 --> 2897.86]  And that means we don't yet see now
[2897.86 --> 2900.96]  The kingdom of God in the way that we someday will.
[2900.96 --> 2908.72]  So many commentators on this already but not yet aspect of the kingdom
[2908.72 --> 2909.96]  Use this illustration.
[2911.04 --> 2912.80]  June 6, 1944,
[2913.22 --> 2916.26]  Was a very important and famous day in World War II.
[2917.32 --> 2920.62]  Allied forces on that day landed on the beaches of Normandy
[2920.62 --> 2925.36]  In massive numbers and secured a foothold in France.
[2926.14 --> 2927.54]  And now looking back,
[2927.90 --> 2930.50]  Historians mark D-Day, right, June 6th,
[2930.50 --> 2932.70]  As the beginning of the end
[2932.70 --> 2935.34]  For the Nazi regime and its allies.
[2936.42 --> 2937.12]  Now, of course,
[2937.88 --> 2939.54]  Did the war end on D-Day?
[2940.66 --> 2943.56]  No, it didn't end exactly on that day.
[2943.68 --> 2945.76]  The war in Europe wasn't officially over
[2945.76 --> 2947.14]  Until 11 months later,
[2947.50 --> 2949.88]  When Germany formally surrendered.
[2950.66 --> 2952.80]  On what we call the E-Day,
[2953.20 --> 2954.34]  Victory in Europe Day.
[2954.34 --> 2959.56]  But once the allies had gained a foothold on the shores of France
[2959.56 --> 2961.38]  And had solidified their position,
[2961.38 --> 2965.68]  We now know that the end was in sight.
[2966.68 --> 2968.22]  And in a similar way,
[2968.42 --> 2970.76]  We live between two momentous days.
[2971.46 --> 2974.90]  We look backward to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
[2974.90 --> 2980.70]  As the moment when God's rule secured a foothold in our world
[2980.70 --> 2984.58]  And assured God of victory.
[2984.58 --> 2986.62]  And yet,
[2987.10 --> 2989.70]  Even though the kingdom of God is already here,
[2989.70 --> 2992.40]  It hasn't yet come in all of its fullness.
[2993.40 --> 2993.50]  Right?
[2993.58 --> 2995.64]  It isn't yet now as widespread,
[2996.00 --> 2996.66]  Or as visible,
[2996.88 --> 2997.66]  Or as obvious,
[2998.28 --> 3000.26]  As we long for it to be.
[3001.30 --> 3002.88]  And so during this time,
[3003.00 --> 3006.22]  In between these two momentous days,
[3006.54 --> 3008.08]  We are looking also forward.
[3008.58 --> 3009.30]  We're praying
[3009.30 --> 3013.74]  For the ultimate arrival of God's kingdom to come.
[3014.78 --> 3016.12]  But we do so in hope,
[3016.26 --> 3017.22]  Knowing the end.
[3017.62 --> 3018.80]  Knowing the end of the story.
[3019.18 --> 3020.22]  And that victory is assured.
[3021.22 --> 3023.92]  And that's why Jesus taught us to pray for God's kingdom to come.
[3024.88 --> 3025.72]  When we pray,
[3025.92 --> 3026.88]  Your kingdom come,
[3026.94 --> 3027.34]  We're saying,
[3027.50 --> 3027.76]  Father,
[3028.12 --> 3031.48]  Make your healing reign in the world
[3031.48 --> 3033.56]  More and more tangible,
[3034.48 --> 3035.48]  More and more visible,
[3036.42 --> 3037.20]  In our world.
[3037.20 --> 3037.68]  Lord,
[3037.68 --> 3038.68]  Lord,
[3038.68 --> 3039.82]  When we pray,
[3040.18 --> 3041.10]  Your kingdom come,
[3041.20 --> 3041.36]  Lord,
[3041.46 --> 3044.20]  Would you reign without any rival
[3044.20 --> 3045.74]  In all of the earth?
[3048.32 --> 3049.56]  So how do we pray,
[3050.46 --> 3051.20]  Your kingdom come?
[3051.82 --> 3053.76]  I want to suggest three ways for us.
[3054.58 --> 3055.10]  First,
[3055.32 --> 3055.86]  When we pray,
[3055.94 --> 3056.74]  Your kingdom come,
[3057.24 --> 3058.50]  We pray for God's kingdom
[3058.50 --> 3060.04]  To come in us.
[3060.76 --> 3062.12]  To come in us.
[3062.72 --> 3062.94]  Right?
[3063.04 --> 3063.26]  First,
[3063.34 --> 3065.46]  We must pray it for ourselves.
[3066.68 --> 3067.18]  Right?
[3067.28 --> 3067.78]  God's kingdom,
[3067.88 --> 3070.68]  It's not just something that comes to the world around us.
[3070.80 --> 3073.32]  It's something that happens first in our own hearts.
[3074.20 --> 3080.58]  So to pray for God's kingdom means that you and I need to acknowledge Jesus as our king.
[3081.16 --> 3081.58]  Right?
[3081.64 --> 3085.20]  And that means the old you is going to be gone.
[3085.66 --> 3088.38]  And a new you starts in its place.
[3088.38 --> 3091.04]  And on the one hand,
[3091.72 --> 3092.42]  That sounds great,
[3092.48 --> 3092.64]  Right?
[3093.36 --> 3093.72]  I mean,
[3093.86 --> 3095.82]  I've got parts of myself that I don't like.
[3096.38 --> 3098.06]  I've got parts of myself that,
[3098.26 --> 3098.40]  Sure,
[3098.48 --> 3099.46]  I want God to become,
[3099.64 --> 3100.52]  To come as king,
[3100.76 --> 3101.70]  To restore,
[3101.92 --> 3102.90]  To bring that renewal,
[3102.90 --> 3104.72]  In my own life.
[3105.24 --> 3106.12]  To get rid of my,
[3106.12 --> 3107.80]  My problems of impatience,
[3108.06 --> 3109.18]  Or my,
[3109.22 --> 3110.32]  My problems of worry.
[3110.32 --> 3112.58]  But friends,
[3112.66 --> 3115.62]  The layers of the self go so much deeper.
[3116.70 --> 3120.08]  Far closer to home than we imagine at first.
[3121.52 --> 3123.94]  So if we're going to live under God's rule and reign,
[3124.44 --> 3125.02]  Well, you know what?
[3125.08 --> 3125.50]  Guess what?
[3126.34 --> 3126.98]  God's,
[3127.64 --> 3130.36]  God delights in things like forgiveness.
[3130.36 --> 3133.88]  And you know who doesn't like forgiveness?
[3134.06 --> 3134.94]  Who doesn't like forgiveness?
[3136.38 --> 3137.16]  You don't.
[3138.10 --> 3138.68]  I don't.
[3139.48 --> 3139.78]  I mean,
[3139.80 --> 3141.36]  Of course I like it when people forgive me.
[3141.88 --> 3141.98]  Right?
[3142.74 --> 3145.64]  But what about that person who cut me off in traffic?
[3146.34 --> 3150.08]  What about the person who did that thing to me?
[3151.00 --> 3153.52]  Or who said that thing to me?
[3154.76 --> 3155.18]  Right?
[3155.30 --> 3159.20]  That's a whole different level of forgiveness than we are actually interested in.
[3160.36 --> 3164.24]  But if God's kingdom is going to come into your life,
[3164.58 --> 3166.82]  Things are going to have to change about us.
[3168.28 --> 3171.16]  And when we really dig into praying,
[3171.36 --> 3173.26]  Your kingdom come.
[3174.14 --> 3179.40]  We discover that our lives clash with that kingdom in all kinds of ways.
[3180.40 --> 3182.88]  And that's why we need to pray this a lot.
[3182.98 --> 3183.12]  Right?
[3184.22 --> 3190.28]  Because we are in daily need of resubmitting ourselves to Jesus.
[3190.36 --> 3190.98]  As the king.
[3192.10 --> 3193.64]  And it's hard.
[3195.58 --> 3197.54]  And so we pray for God's kingdom to come.
[3197.64 --> 3202.46]  The first place we have to think about that kingdom coming is in our own hearts.
[3203.12 --> 3204.36]  In our own lives.
[3204.40 --> 3206.32]  And that's probably the toughest place of all.
[3206.32 --> 3215.06]  The second place for us to consider how to pray for God's kingdom to come is to think about our church.
[3215.06 --> 3220.20]  Now this might feel or sound a bit counterintuitive.
[3221.02 --> 3221.64]  You're saying?
[3221.96 --> 3222.52]  I hear you.
[3223.54 --> 3227.24]  Isn't the church the place where God's rule is already?
[3228.08 --> 3228.30]  Right?
[3228.38 --> 3232.92]  Isn't the church where his kingship is already taken seriously?
[3234.34 --> 3234.96]  Well, sure.
[3235.18 --> 3236.20]  On one level, yeah.
[3236.60 --> 3237.42]  That's true.
[3238.42 --> 3242.68]  But Latin or CRC, are we perfectly mature?
[3245.24 --> 3245.70]  Right?
[3245.74 --> 3251.70]  Are we already everything that God intends us to become by his grace and by the work of the Holy Spirit among us?
[3252.46 --> 3252.90]  No.
[3253.72 --> 3254.94]  There's work to do, right?
[3255.80 --> 3257.76]  There are areas where we can grow.
[3258.76 --> 3260.96]  We need God's kingdom to come among us.
[3261.04 --> 3262.32]  To transform us.
[3262.32 --> 3266.90]  That we might relate to one another according to the values of the kingdom.
[3267.26 --> 3270.96]  That we might serve one another according to the values of the kingdom.
[3271.92 --> 3276.56]  We pray for God to help us embody his kingdom among us.
[3278.46 --> 3283.40]  So I heard this story told by a pastor of a church in Nashville, Tennessee.
[3284.36 --> 3288.94]  He tells the story of a woman named Janet who attended their church for the first time.
[3289.06 --> 3291.16]  She was a guest, not yet a Christian.
[3291.16 --> 3294.70]  So she dropped off her two boys at the nursery.
[3295.20 --> 3296.78]  Came into the worship service.
[3298.08 --> 3302.32]  And then she went back after the worship service to pick up her boys from the nursery.
[3303.20 --> 3305.68]  And one of the nursery workers pulled her aside.
[3305.92 --> 3309.06]  And one of every parent's worst fears.
[3309.78 --> 3315.18]  And told her, hey, you know, I'm sorry to say there's been a few issues with your boys.
[3315.30 --> 3318.10]  They got into a number of fights with the other children.
[3318.10 --> 3322.04]  And Janet felt deeply ashamed.
[3323.14 --> 3326.76]  And in the nursery filled with other parents and children.
[3326.90 --> 3328.16]  This is a very large church.
[3328.72 --> 3331.50]  She ended up scolding her boys loudly.
[3332.28 --> 3335.38]  And then while leaving, screamed a swear word.
[3336.82 --> 3338.38]  Can you just imagine the scene?
[3339.22 --> 3341.42]  The pastor heard about the incident afterward.
[3341.64 --> 3343.36]  And said, well, I guess we're not going to see her again.
[3343.76 --> 3345.48]  And that didn't seem to go so well.
[3345.48 --> 3353.84]  But the nursery worker who had talked to Janet realized that she had left her contact information on a visitor welcome card.
[3354.00 --> 3355.32]  And said, yes, you'll contact me.
[3356.90 --> 3361.36]  And so the nursery worker asked the pastor, hey, do you think I can contact her?
[3361.46 --> 3363.60]  And he said, well, I don't think we have anything to lose.
[3363.96 --> 3364.42]  Go ahead.
[3364.42 --> 3368.70]  And this is what she wrote to Janet.
[3368.94 --> 3374.34]  Dear Janet, I'm so glad you and your boys visited the church.
[3375.22 --> 3384.16]  Oh, and about that exchange when you pick them up, let's just say I found it refreshing that you would feel free to speak with an honest vocabulary in church.
[3384.16 --> 3387.22]  I'm really drawn to honesty.
[3387.82 --> 3390.04]  I hope we can become friends.
[3391.42 --> 3394.48]  And to their surprise, Janet came back.
[3395.54 --> 3398.68]  And she came back the next week and the week after that.
[3398.72 --> 3399.68]  And she kept coming.
[3400.58 --> 3406.24]  And a few years later, they hired her to direct the nursery of their church.
[3406.24 --> 3410.58]  That's a great ending to that story.
[3411.56 --> 3417.20]  When we pray for God's kingdom to come in our church, this is kind of like what we're talking about.
[3418.34 --> 3418.56]  Right?
[3418.60 --> 3424.10]  It fundamentally changes the way we relate to one another and to our neighbors.
[3425.52 --> 3425.72]  Right?
[3425.76 --> 3432.68]  If we really allow God to be in charge, it changes the way we think about people like Janet.
[3432.68 --> 3445.12]  Now, third and finally, when we pray your kingdom come, we're praying for God's kingdom to come and change not only our hearts, not only our church, but to change the entire world.
[3446.14 --> 3458.12]  We must remember, though, first, that the kingdom of God is never identified with any particular nation, any particular ethnic group, any particular political system.
[3458.12 --> 3462.76]  As Christians, we are called to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness.
[3463.82 --> 3467.14]  And His kingdom is very different than any other kingdom on earth.
[3468.30 --> 3474.02]  And yet, because God rules all things, we ought to pray for the best possible government.
[3475.18 --> 3476.30]  We ought to pray for marriages.
[3477.22 --> 3484.76]  We ought to pray for businesses and institutions, for schools and senior centers and museums.
[3484.76 --> 3491.24]  Because God loves the world, and He calls us, His people, to love our neighbors.
[3492.60 --> 3500.08]  The Bible doesn't go so far as to say that the kingdom of God comes when those things run well and flourish.
[3500.52 --> 3504.16]  But it is clear that Christians are not to ignore the world.
[3504.16 --> 3520.40]  And as we pray for His kingdom to come, we pray, then, that His goodness and His righteousness and His justice and His beauty of His rule would come to the whole world, as it will one day.
[3521.92 --> 3526.42]  Friends, so this and so much more is what it means to pray your kingdom come.
[3526.42 --> 3527.64]  Right?
[3527.70 --> 3536.10]  Jesus teaches us to pray for God's kingdom to come fully and completely on earth as it already is in heaven.
[3537.60 --> 3541.26]  And part of what that means is that we pray, come, Lord Jesus.
[3542.42 --> 3542.64]  Right?
[3542.90 --> 3544.08]  Come, return.
[3544.30 --> 3551.70]  That V-E day that we're longing for, would it come so that your rule would be complete in all of the earth?
[3551.70 --> 3556.82]  Come back and put everything to right, everything that is broken, would you come and restore it?
[3557.78 --> 3562.56]  And in the meantime, extend your rule here and now.
[3562.78 --> 3566.82]  Allow your world to more and more fully live under your reign.
[3568.26 --> 3569.12]  Your kingdom come.
[3569.68 --> 3570.42]  Let's pray together.
[3570.42 --> 3575.58]  Father, would your kingdom come.
[3578.40 --> 3582.06]  In our hearts, in this church, in your world.
[3583.12 --> 3586.00]  Father, you are the king who has ascended to your throne.
[3586.98 --> 3589.10]  You reign over all things.
[3589.16 --> 3590.56]  The earth is your footstool.
[3591.16 --> 3592.64]  And you are a good king.
[3594.28 --> 3598.80]  The king that we don't deserve, but the king that we long for.
[3598.80 --> 3601.38]  Lord, would you rule.
[3603.36 --> 3604.68]  Would your kingdom come.
[3605.16 --> 3607.46]  We pray in your holy name.
[3608.32 --> 3608.62]  Amen.
[3610.50 --> 3611.66]  So let's all stand.
[3611.98 --> 3614.10]  Let's sing our song of response this morning.
[3615.18 --> 3616.70]  To God be the glory.
[3616.70 --> 3616.74]  To God be the glory.
[3628.80 --> 3647.86]  Great things he has done.
[3647.86 --> 3650.86]  God loved in the world.
[3650.86 --> 3650.88]  God loved in the world.
[3650.88 --> 3654.06]  God he gave us his song.
[3654.06 --> 3657.10]  He healed in his life.
[3657.32 --> 3660.24]  He had adored him for sin.
[3660.66 --> 3663.26]  And over the life.
[3663.42 --> 3665.92]  He had all made glory.
[3666.48 --> 3668.66]  Praise the Lord.
[3668.80 --> 3670.26]  Praise the Lord.
[3670.38 --> 3673.22]  Let me hear his voice.
[3673.64 --> 3675.04]  Praise the Lord.
[3675.24 --> 3676.54]  Praise the Lord.
[3676.54 --> 3679.80]  Let the people rejoice.
[3679.80 --> 3679.82]  Let the people rejoice.
[3679.82 --> 3681.70]  O God.
[3681.86 --> 3683.02]  To the Father.
[3683.42 --> 3686.06]  Through Jesus the Son.
[3686.60 --> 3689.58]  And give him the glory.
[3689.94 --> 3692.82]  Great things he has done.

[3833.14 --> 3836.56]  And I wanted to pray according to these things I just mentioned.
[3836.80 --> 3841.28]  Praying for God's kingdom to come into our hearts, into our church, and into our world.
[3841.28 --> 3847.84]  And when I say, Lord, in your mercy, you can join me by saying, hear our prayer.
[3848.74 --> 3849.60]  Let's pray together.
[3851.80 --> 3860.04]  Almighty and everlasting God, you govern all things, both in heaven and on earth.
[3860.96 --> 3867.86]  And so we ask that you would come and rule in our hearts, break through any darkness in us.
[3868.68 --> 3874.34]  King Jesus, illuminate every corner of each of our lives with your healing light.
[3875.12 --> 3878.56]  Break through any resistance to your rule in us.
[3879.42 --> 3882.14]  Break the bondage of sin that enslaves us.
[3883.16 --> 3884.90]  Humble us, Lord, and cleanse us.
[3886.06 --> 3890.98]  Create in us a pure heart and renew a steadfast spirit within us.
[3890.98 --> 3898.00]  And King Jesus, would you give us courage to follow you in our lives, come what may.
[3899.30 --> 3902.68]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.

[3908.70 --> 3918.10]  Make us, your church, a clear and engaging sign that the future is breaking into the present.
[3919.66 --> 3928.84]  Grant, O God, that when the town of Ladner looks at us, that it would see you and your new world order.
[3928.84 --> 3940.20]  The revolution of your kingdom that turns everything wrong to right, everything that is upside down, to the way that you created it to be.
[3942.04 --> 3947.18]  King Jesus, do through us what you did when you walked the earth as a man.
[3947.18 --> 3960.06]  Through us, would you heal the sick, free the captives, reconcile enemies, raise the dead to newness of life, and proclaim the good news of your kingship.
[3961.74 --> 3968.64]  And Father, as we think about our church, we lift up to you all those who are sick and who mourn.
[3968.64 --> 3977.42]  We pray, come Lord Jesus, that you would come and heal and renew them.
[3978.10 --> 3983.04]  We especially, Lord, pray this morning for Angela's father who has had a stroke.
[3983.90 --> 3989.58]  Lord, would your kingdom come into his hospital room?
[3990.16 --> 3994.12]  Would you help him, Lord, to recover mobility?
[3995.32 --> 3997.08]  And would you, Lord, heal him?
[3998.64 --> 4004.24]  We pray also, Lord, for the global church and for our shared mission in your world.

[4095.12 --> 4097.46]  We pray for the protection of the disabled,
[4098.60 --> 4101.90]  that they would know their valuable place in community.
[4103.18 --> 4107.86]  May your church be known as the community who stands for all of life,
[4108.34 --> 4113.26]  and that bears witness to Jesus who brings life to the world.
[4113.26 --> 4117.20]  Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4118.18 --> 4119.42]  Father in heaven,
[4120.60 --> 4123.38]  mercifully hear the supplications of your people.
[4124.08 --> 4126.38]  We ask through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
