[276.00 --> 278.00]  Good morning.
[278.00 --> 279.00]  Good morning.
[279.00 --> 281.00]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[281.00 --> 289.00]  Welcome to all of you that are here in person and also those of you who may be joining us in on the live stream.
[289.00 --> 298.00]  My name is John and I will be leading your service this morning and Pastor Jason will be coming later during the service to bring us God's word.
[298.00 --> 302.00]  Special welcome to those of you who are visiting with us.
[302.00 --> 311.00]  Please join us for a fellowship and refreshments after the service in the fellowship room which is straight to the back of the building there.
[311.00 --> 313.00]  Just a few announcements.
[313.00 --> 316.00]  You see all the sign up sheets there.
[316.00 --> 318.00]  Please avail yourself.
[318.00 --> 321.00]  Jason said you have to sign two out of five.
[321.00 --> 327.00]  And he said that if he can go in the choir then everybody can go in the choir.
[327.00 --> 334.00]  So one particular note is that this starting this Tuesday will be the first membership class.
[334.00 --> 347.00]  So for those of you who haven't signed up yet or are interested to learn more about our church, our Reformed faith, and what it means to your member, please feel free to join.
[347.00 --> 354.00]  Today in our church calendar, as you may have seen in the overhead, is Christ the King Sunday.
[354.00 --> 359.00]  And I'll just read to you what Pastor Jason sent to us in the Connections Weekly.
[359.00 --> 365.00]  This Sunday focuses our worship on the cosmic character of God's reign over the world.
[365.00 --> 372.00]  It is a proclamation to all that everything in creation and culture must submit to Christ.
[372.00 --> 378.00]  And an invitation to joyfully submit to his rule.
[378.00 --> 381.00]  And our responsive readings will reflect this theme.
[381.00 --> 387.00]  So we'll start with our call to worship, which will be on the PowerPoint.
[387.00 --> 388.00]  Let's pray.
[388.00 --> 389.00]  Let's pray.
[389.00 --> 390.00]  Let's pray.
[390.00 --> 391.00]  Let's pray.
[391.00 --> 392.00]  Let's pray.
[392.00 --> 393.00]  Lift up your heads, O you gates.
[393.00 --> 396.00]  Be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
[396.00 --> 399.00]  Who is this King of glory?
[399.00 --> 401.00]  The Lord Almighty.
[401.00 --> 404.00]  He is the King of glory.
[404.00 --> 409.00]  I'm going to lead you in a prayer of adoration, which is from Revelation 4.
[409.00 --> 410.00]  Amen.
[410.00 --> 415.00]  You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[415.00 --> 420.00]  For you created all things, and by your will they were created.
[420.00 --> 422.00]  And have their being.
[422.00 --> 428.00]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength,
[428.00 --> 430.00]  and honor and glory and praise.
[430.00 --> 437.00]  To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, be praise and honor and glory and power.
[437.00 --> 439.00]  For ever and ever.
[439.00 --> 440.00]  Amen.
[440.00 --> 445.00]  Please rise for God's greeting.
[445.00 --> 450.00]  And God's greeting this morning comes to us from 2 John in the third chapter.
[450.00 --> 456.00]  Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ,
[456.00 --> 460.00]  the Father, Son, in truth and love.
[460.00 --> 464.00]  And as God has greeted us, let's just take a moment to greet those around us.
[464.00 --> 465.00]  Do you want the hearts?
[465.00 --> 466.00]  May God's greeting?
[466.00 --> 467.00]  Yes.
[467.00 --> 468.00]  Do you want the hearts?
[468.00 --> 469.00]  Do you want the hearts?
[469.00 --> 470.00]  If so for God standspi in this morning, to thank you for schwierig?
[471.00 --> 473.00]  The Lord knows almost that you are under twice as well.
[473.00 --> 474.00]  Are you with his mind?
[474.00 --> 475.00]  Our hearts?
[475.00 --> 476.00]  I receive aació in this afternoon?
[476.00 --> 477.00]  May God.
[477.00 --> 478.00]  Our hearts?
[478.00 --> 479.00]  James.
[479.00 --> 480.00]  That's the right.
[480.00 --> 483.00]  This week is this morning we are ready to meet the George sir.
[483.00 --> 512.98]  Thank you.
[513.00 --> 542.98]  Thank you.
[543.00 --> 551.48]  With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, his love endures forever.
[552.94 --> 560.08]  For the life that's been reborn, his love endures forever.
[560.08 --> 567.08]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[569.56 --> 576.08]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[576.08 --> 581.08]  Forever God is faithful.
[582.16 --> 585.56]  Forever God is strong.
[586.20 --> 589.96]  Forever God is with us.
[590.50 --> 591.26]  Forever.
[593.90 --> 595.14]  Forever.
[595.14 --> 596.14]  Forever.
[596.14 --> 597.14]  Forever.
[597.14 --> 598.14]  Forever.
[598.14 --> 606.22]  From the rising to the setting sun, his love endures forever.
[606.22 --> 612.10]  And by the grace of God, we will carry on.
[612.50 --> 615.26]  His love endures forever.
[616.64 --> 618.04]  Sing praise.
[620.64 --> 622.22]  Sing praise.
[624.22 --> 626.22]  Sing praise.
[626.22 --> 627.22]  Sing praise.
[627.22 --> 628.28]  Sing praise.
[628.28 --> 630.22]  Sing praise.
[632.70 --> 635.88]  Forever God is faithful.
[637.22 --> 640.60]  Forever God is strong.
[641.28 --> 644.22]  Forever God is with us.
[644.22 --> 646.22]  Forever.
[646.22 --> 650.06]  Forever, forever
[676.22 --> 695.38]  Father in heaven, how we love you
[695.38 --> 703.18]  We lift your name in all the earth
[703.18 --> 709.42]  May your kingdom be established in our praises
[709.42 --> 716.18]  As your people declare your mighty words
[716.76 --> 723.26]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[723.26 --> 730.18]  Who was and is and is to come
[730.18 --> 737.32]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[737.32 --> 744.18]  Who reigns forevermore
[744.18 --> 751.18]  Father of mercy be exalted
[751.18 --> 758.32]  May Jesus' name be lifted high
[758.32 --> 766.32]  For the sacrifice of love has won my pardon
[766.32 --> 772.32]  And His resurrection power gives me life
[772.32 --> 779.46]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[779.46 --> 786.46]  Who was and is and is to come
[786.46 --> 793.46]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[793.46 --> 800.60]  Who reigns forevermore
[800.60 --> 802.60]  Who reigns forevermore
[802.60 --> 810.32]  Yeah, you may be seated for the next song
[810.32 --> 812.36]  Which is, I Love to Tell the Story
[812.36 --> 836.32]  I Love to Tell the Story
[836.32 --> 841.46]  Of Unseen Things Above
[841.46 --> 846.02]  Of Jesus and His Glory
[846.02 --> 851.94]  Of Jesus and His Love
[851.94 --> 856.46]  I Love to Tell the Story
[856.46 --> 861.60]  Because I Know It Is True
[861.60 --> 867.60]  It satisfies my longings
[867.60 --> 872.46]  As nothing else can do
[872.46 --> 877.60]  I Love to Tell the Story
[877.60 --> 878.74]  It will be my theme
[878.74 --> 882.74]  It will be my theme in glory
[882.74 --> 888.18]  To tell the old, old story
[888.18 --> 894.74]  Of Jesus and His Love
[894.74 --> 901.42]  I Love to Tell the Story
[901.42 --> 906.56]  It is pleasant to repeat
[906.56 --> 911.96]  What seems each time I tell it
[911.96 --> 917.22]  More wonderfully sweet
[917.22 --> 921.96]  I Love to Tell the Story
[921.96 --> 927.84]  For some have never heard
[927.84 --> 932.12]  The message of salvation
[932.12 --> 938.32]  From God's own Holy Word
[938.32 --> 943.12]  I Love to Tell the Story
[943.12 --> 948.56]  It will be my theme in glory
[948.56 --> 953.56]  To tell the story
[953.56 --> 960.56]  Of Jesus and His Love
[960.56 --> 967.84]  I Love to Tell the Story
[967.84 --> 972.56]  For those who know it best
[972.56 --> 977.56]  Seem hungering and thirsting
[977.56 --> 982.56]  To hear it like the rest
[982.56 --> 987.56]  And when in scenes of glory
[988.12 --> 992.56]  I sing the new, new song
[992.56 --> 998.56]  It will be the old, old story
[998.56 --> 1005.56]  That I love to tell the story
[1005.56 --> 1008.56]  I love to tell the story
[1008.56 --> 1014.56]  It will be my theme in glory
[1014.56 --> 1019.56]  To tell the old, old story
[1019.56 --> 1025.56]  Of Jesus and His Love
[1025.56 --> 1030.56]  Amen
[1030.56 --> 1032.56]  Amen
[1032.56 --> 1034.56]  Amen
[1034.56 --> 1037.00]  I'd like to lead you in our prayer of confession
[1037.00 --> 1038.62]  Which will be on the PowerPoint
[1038.62 --> 1040.78]  Shall we pray?
[1041.32 --> 1042.30]  Righteous God
[1042.30 --> 1044.44]  You have crowned Jesus Christ
[1044.44 --> 1045.38]  As Lord of all
[1045.38 --> 1048.64]  We confess that we have not bowed before Him
[1048.64 --> 1051.22]  And are slow to acknowledge His rule
[1051.22 --> 1054.32]  We give allegiance to the powers of this world
[1054.32 --> 1058.10]  And fail to be governed by justice and love
[1058.10 --> 1061.58]  In your mercy, forgive us
[1061.58 --> 1065.76]  Rise us to acclaim Him as ruler of all
[1065.76 --> 1067.64]  That we may have
[1067.64 --> 1073.28]  Realtive ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1073.28 --> 1078.02]  And our assurance is from Revelation 5
[1078.02 --> 1079.14]  Also on the PowerPoint
[1079.14 --> 1081.32]  Do not weep
[1081.32 --> 1084.32]  See the line of the tribe of Judah
[1084.32 --> 1086.32]  The root of David has triumphed
[1086.32 --> 1089.32]  With His blood He has purchased people for God
[1089.32 --> 1093.32]  From every tribe and language and people and nation
[1093.32 --> 1097.32]  He has made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God
[1097.32 --> 1099.32]  And they will reign on the earth
[1099.32 --> 1101.32]  Thanks be to God
[1101.32 --> 1103.32]  Thanks be to God
[1103.32 --> 1105.10]  Now let's sing of that assurance with
[1105.10 --> 1108.32]  I know not why God's wondrous grace
[1108.32 --> 1111.32]  Perhaps we can rise for that
[1111.32 --> 1134.32]  I know not why God's wondrous grace to me
[1134.32 --> 1136.32]  He has made them to be a kingdom and God
[1136.32 --> 1141.32]  Nor why unworthy Christ in love
[1141.32 --> 1148.32]  In love redeem me for His own
[1148.32 --> 1156.32]  But I know I have believed and am persuaded
[1156.32 --> 1158.32]  That He is able
[1158.32 --> 1164.32]  To keep that which I've committed
[1164.32 --> 1170.32]  Unto Him against that day
[1170.32 --> 1182.32]  I know not how this saving faith to me He did impart
[1182.32 --> 1194.32]  Nor how believing in His word brought peace within my heart
[1194.32 --> 1197.32]  But I know I have believed and am persuaded
[1197.32 --> 1199.32]  But I know not how the Spirit looks
[1199.32 --> 1200.32]  But I know not how the Spirit looks
[1200.32 --> 1202.32]  But I know not how I have believed
[1202.32 --> 1210.66]  that he is able to keep that which I've committed
[1210.66 --> 1216.80]  unto him against that day.
[1218.64 --> 1224.66]  I know not how the Spirit moves
[1224.66 --> 1229.76]  convincing us of sin,
[1229.76 --> 1235.74]  revealing Jesus through the Word,
[1236.18 --> 1241.06]  creating faith in him.
[1242.06 --> 1246.44]  I know not how the believer
[1246.44 --> 1252.24]  and am persuaded that he is able
[1252.24 --> 1257.72]  to keep that which I've committed
[1257.72 --> 1263.70]  unto him against that day.
[1263.70 --> 1277.68]  I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me,
[1277.68 --> 1284.10]  of weary ways or golden days,
[1284.44 --> 1288.66]  before his face I've seen.
[1290.06 --> 1294.56]  But I know whom I have believed
[1294.56 --> 1300.54]  and am persuaded that he is able
[1300.54 --> 1306.12]  to keep that which I've committed
[1306.12 --> 1312.54]  unto him against that day.
[1312.54 --> 1324.66]  At this point, children age 3 to grade 5
[1324.66 --> 1327.84]  are dismissed along with their teachers
[1327.84 --> 1329.34]  for a kid's life.
[1330.28 --> 1332.62]  And we bless them on their way
[1332.62 --> 1334.78]  with the children.
[1334.78 --> 1338.32]  and we'll invite Pastor Jason to come up.
[1338.32 --> 1338.76]  Thank you.
[1357.76 --> 1359.32]  I'm not Pastor Jason,
[1359.32 --> 1361.12]  but I'll be reading the text for today.
[1363.08 --> 1367.32]  I'm reading from Ephesians 6, 17 through 24.
[1368.84 --> 1371.56]  That's Ephesians 6, 17 through 24.
[1372.70 --> 1374.40]  Take the helmet of salvation
[1374.40 --> 1376.02]  and the sword of the Spirit,
[1376.42 --> 1377.60]  which is the Word of God,
[1378.30 --> 1380.82]  and pray in the Spirit on all occasions
[1380.82 --> 1383.60]  with all kinds of prayers and requests.
[1384.40 --> 1385.52]  With this in mind,
[1386.42 --> 1388.90]  be alert and always keep on praying
[1388.90 --> 1390.22]  for all the Lord's people.
[1391.42 --> 1392.50]  Pray also for me,
[1392.98 --> 1394.06]  that when I speak,
[1394.76 --> 1396.00]  words may be given me
[1396.00 --> 1398.14]  so that I will fearlessly make known
[1398.14 --> 1399.56]  the mystery of the gospel,
[1400.52 --> 1403.40]  for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[1404.02 --> 1407.28]  Pray that I may declare it fearlessly
[1407.28 --> 1408.52]  as I should.
[1408.52 --> 1410.70]  Tydeus, dear brother
[1410.70 --> 1412.48]  and faithful servant in the Lord,
[1412.76 --> 1413.92]  will tell you everything
[1413.92 --> 1416.32]  so that you also may know
[1416.32 --> 1417.28]  how I am
[1417.28 --> 1418.70]  and what I am doing.
[1419.74 --> 1421.22]  I'm sending him to you
[1421.22 --> 1422.36]  for this very purpose,
[1422.70 --> 1423.64]  that you may know
[1423.64 --> 1424.78]  how we are
[1424.78 --> 1426.94]  and that he may encourage you.
[1427.84 --> 1429.62]  Peace to the brothers and sisters
[1429.62 --> 1431.38]  and love with faith
[1431.38 --> 1432.44]  from God our Father
[1432.44 --> 1434.14]  and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1434.90 --> 1435.98]  Grace to all
[1435.98 --> 1437.72]  who love our Lord Jesus Christ
[1437.72 --> 1439.70]  with an undying love.
[1440.48 --> 1441.90]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1441.90 --> 1443.56]  Thank you, Father.
[1453.90 --> 1454.88]  Thank you, Martin.
[1454.88 --> 1460.30]  Isn't that an amazing way
[1460.30 --> 1463.34]  to end the letter?
[1463.68 --> 1464.76]  Actually, if you turn me down a bit.
[1466.86 --> 1468.42]  To those who love our Lord
[1468.42 --> 1470.26]  with an undying love.
[1470.78 --> 1470.94]  Right?
[1471.06 --> 1472.14]  An undying love.
[1472.60 --> 1473.14]  It's amazing.
[1474.34 --> 1475.80]  So on this last Sunday
[1475.80 --> 1477.10]  of the Christian year,
[1477.66 --> 1478.30]  right, we've made it
[1478.30 --> 1479.28]  all the way around.
[1479.28 --> 1481.62]  This is Christ the King Sunday,
[1481.62 --> 1483.92]  as John shared with us earlier.
[1484.74 --> 1486.72]  And on this Christ the King Sunday,
[1486.72 --> 1488.60]  we also come to the end
[1488.60 --> 1491.60]  of our sermon series in Ephesians.
[1492.58 --> 1494.20]  Next week, we will begin
[1494.20 --> 1497.00]  a new series for the season of Advent,
[1497.10 --> 1498.88]  the first season in the church calendar,
[1499.10 --> 1500.32]  which I'm very excited about.
[1500.72 --> 1503.56]  We'll be looking at the mothers of Jesus,
[1503.56 --> 1506.36]  the five women who are mentioned
[1506.36 --> 1508.74]  in the Gospel of Matthew,
[1508.84 --> 1509.38]  chapter one,
[1509.48 --> 1511.10]  in Jesus' family tree.
[1511.40 --> 1512.58]  We'll look at their stories.
[1514.68 --> 1516.88]  But before we jump into this passage,
[1517.00 --> 1518.42]  our last passage in Ephesians,
[1518.94 --> 1520.34]  let's pray together.
[1520.40 --> 1521.14]  Would you join me in prayer?
[1521.22 --> 1522.42]  Ask the Holy Spirit's help.
[1523.72 --> 1525.60]  Heavenly Father, bless us now
[1525.60 --> 1528.00]  through the power of your word
[1528.00 --> 1530.08]  that we might be filled
[1530.08 --> 1531.18]  with your spirit
[1531.18 --> 1533.82]  and that we might praise
[1533.82 --> 1535.90]  your Son, Jesus Christ,
[1536.52 --> 1538.96]  and know him as our truth
[1538.96 --> 1540.68]  and our righteousness.
[1541.42 --> 1542.90]  We pray in his name.
[1543.54 --> 1543.86]  Amen.
[1545.24 --> 1547.12]  So one of the very first
[1547.12 --> 1550.12]  literary works in the French language
[1550.12 --> 1552.98]  is called the Song of Roland.
[1553.86 --> 1555.08]  Is anybody familiar
[1555.08 --> 1556.26]  with the Song of Roland?
[1557.90 --> 1558.58]  No.
[1559.68 --> 1560.96]  Oh, one person in the back, Ryan.
[1561.18 --> 1561.64]  All right.
[1561.74 --> 1562.04]  Awesome.
[1562.68 --> 1563.80]  I wasn't too much either.
[1564.20 --> 1565.72]  But here's a photo
[1565.72 --> 1567.90]  of good old Roland.
[1568.52 --> 1569.70]  He was a commander
[1569.70 --> 1571.06]  in Charlemagne's army.
[1572.06 --> 1574.18]  They had been fighting in Spain.
[1574.84 --> 1576.82]  And on the return back to France,
[1576.82 --> 1578.74]  they were ambushed
[1578.74 --> 1580.02]  in the Pyrenees Mountains.
[1580.68 --> 1583.14]  And so Roland was the commander
[1583.14 --> 1584.50]  of the rear guard.
[1585.12 --> 1585.84]  So all the rest
[1585.84 --> 1586.56]  of Charlemagne's army
[1586.56 --> 1587.18]  was up ahead.
[1587.26 --> 1588.28]  He was kind of in the back.
[1588.28 --> 1589.60]  They were ambushed
[1589.60 --> 1590.62]  from behind.
[1591.16 --> 1592.78]  And his part of the army
[1592.78 --> 1593.80]  was overwhelmed
[1593.80 --> 1595.28]  by the attack.
[1596.10 --> 1597.32]  But the real tragedy
[1597.32 --> 1598.06]  of the story
[1598.06 --> 1599.28]  is that their defeat
[1599.28 --> 1601.50]  was actually unnecessary.
[1602.64 --> 1603.94]  Roland could have
[1603.94 --> 1605.52]  called for help.
[1606.20 --> 1607.98]  He could have called
[1607.98 --> 1609.12]  Charlemagne's knights
[1609.12 --> 1609.98]  who were up ahead
[1609.98 --> 1611.20]  to come to their aid.
[1611.26 --> 1612.86]  He could have blown his horn.
[1612.86 --> 1614.44]  And the horn
[1614.44 --> 1615.08]  has a name,
[1615.74 --> 1616.30]  Oliphant.
[1616.82 --> 1617.54]  I guess because it was
[1617.54 --> 1619.08]  made out of an elephant's tusk.
[1620.62 --> 1622.82]  But he would not
[1622.82 --> 1623.88]  blow his horn.
[1624.60 --> 1625.34]  He believed that
[1625.34 --> 1626.26]  blowing his horn
[1626.26 --> 1627.78]  in the middle of the battle
[1627.78 --> 1629.60]  would be an act of cowardice.
[1630.48 --> 1632.62]  Pride held him back.
[1633.64 --> 1635.12]  And because he refused
[1635.12 --> 1636.56]  to call for help
[1636.56 --> 1638.54]  until the very end,
[1638.64 --> 1639.56]  so he is calling for help
[1639.56 --> 1640.02]  in the photo,
[1640.02 --> 1641.52]  but this is at the very end.
[1641.76 --> 1643.62]  He's about to be overwhelmed
[1643.62 --> 1645.46]  and he calls down
[1645.46 --> 1646.66]  actually revenge
[1646.66 --> 1647.82]  from Charlemagne's army
[1647.82 --> 1648.38]  to come back
[1648.38 --> 1649.40]  and wipe out these enemies
[1649.40 --> 1651.18]  who had defeated him.
[1652.36 --> 1654.82]  But he was in his army.
[1655.00 --> 1655.62]  They were destroyed.
[1656.68 --> 1656.86]  You know,
[1656.94 --> 1657.92]  he had his armor.
[1658.26 --> 1659.28]  He had his sword.
[1659.96 --> 1661.12]  But he didn't use
[1661.12 --> 1662.90]  his most valuable weapon.
[1663.40 --> 1665.16]  He didn't use his horn.
[1665.16 --> 1667.64]  You know,
[1667.70 --> 1668.18]  the horn
[1668.18 --> 1669.96]  is how you call for help.
[1670.68 --> 1671.46]  It's to say,
[1671.72 --> 1673.40]  we're in trouble here.
[1673.72 --> 1674.08]  Right?
[1674.10 --> 1675.14]  We can't stand
[1675.14 --> 1676.06]  against this enemy
[1676.06 --> 1677.40]  in our own strength.
[1677.80 --> 1680.08]  We need help.
[1681.84 --> 1683.12]  And so the horn
[1683.12 --> 1684.32]  is really
[1684.32 --> 1685.90]  the most valuable weapon
[1685.90 --> 1686.26]  because
[1686.26 --> 1687.90]  you can summon
[1687.90 --> 1689.34]  all of this help
[1689.34 --> 1691.44]  to your side.
[1691.62 --> 1692.82]  All of this strength,
[1692.82 --> 1694.10]  all of these resources
[1694.10 --> 1695.00]  are available
[1695.00 --> 1696.16]  to you,
[1696.56 --> 1697.76]  but only
[1697.76 --> 1699.58]  if you use it.
[1699.82 --> 1700.88]  Only if you
[1700.88 --> 1701.90]  call for help.
[1702.66 --> 1703.62]  And so if you allow me
[1703.62 --> 1704.06]  to borrow
[1704.06 --> 1705.24]  from the Song of Roland,
[1706.10 --> 1706.60]  prayer
[1706.60 --> 1709.02]  is our horn.
[1710.06 --> 1710.62]  Prayer
[1710.62 --> 1712.02]  is how we
[1712.02 --> 1713.06]  call
[1713.06 --> 1714.02]  for help.
[1714.80 --> 1715.72]  When we pray,
[1716.08 --> 1717.72]  what are we asking for?
[1718.20 --> 1718.44]  Like,
[1718.48 --> 1719.32]  what are we hoping
[1719.32 --> 1720.46]  will happen
[1720.46 --> 1721.40]  when we pray?
[1721.40 --> 1722.74]  Well,
[1722.80 --> 1723.32]  we're asking
[1723.32 --> 1724.00]  for God
[1724.00 --> 1724.88]  to come
[1724.88 --> 1726.68]  and intervene
[1726.68 --> 1728.16]  in our situation.
[1728.72 --> 1729.20]  Right?
[1729.26 --> 1729.92]  We're asking God
[1729.92 --> 1731.06]  to come into the world
[1731.06 --> 1733.36]  and to change things.
[1733.90 --> 1734.76]  We're asking Him
[1734.76 --> 1735.52]  to do things
[1735.52 --> 1736.88]  that we cannot do.
[1738.74 --> 1739.98]  And we're even asking
[1739.98 --> 1740.86]  for more than just,
[1740.92 --> 1741.06]  you know,
[1741.12 --> 1741.32]  like,
[1741.54 --> 1742.56]  give me, Lord,
[1742.90 --> 1743.76]  just a little bit
[1743.76 --> 1744.58]  more strength
[1744.58 --> 1746.54]  so that I can do it,
[1746.60 --> 1747.32]  so that I can do
[1747.32 --> 1747.88]  what, you know,
[1747.92 --> 1749.08]  I need to do here.
[1749.80 --> 1750.00]  You know,
[1750.00 --> 1750.38]  we do that
[1750.38 --> 1751.16]  from time to time
[1751.16 --> 1751.76]  and that's okay.
[1752.58 --> 1753.58]  But in prayer,
[1753.78 --> 1754.70]  we're also
[1754.70 --> 1756.26]  asking God
[1756.26 --> 1757.36]  to do
[1757.36 --> 1758.96]  supernatural things.
[1760.22 --> 1760.82]  Dear Lord,
[1761.80 --> 1762.34]  heal
[1762.34 --> 1764.00]  this person.
[1764.64 --> 1764.76]  Right?
[1764.82 --> 1766.48]  Against all odds,
[1766.66 --> 1766.80]  Lord,
[1766.90 --> 1767.88]  you can do it.
[1769.54 --> 1770.26]  Dear Lord,
[1770.34 --> 1771.10]  this loved one
[1771.10 --> 1771.66]  who has walked
[1771.66 --> 1772.44]  away from you,
[1773.30 --> 1774.64]  only you
[1774.64 --> 1776.28]  can change
[1776.28 --> 1777.14]  their hearts.
[1777.14 --> 1779.14]  prayer.
[1779.14 --> 1779.80]  Dear Lord,
[1779.88 --> 1780.62]  this conflict
[1780.62 --> 1781.34]  that I'm having
[1781.34 --> 1782.18]  in my marriage,
[1782.88 --> 1783.82]  only you
[1783.82 --> 1785.14]  can bring
[1785.14 --> 1785.82]  restoration.
[1787.24 --> 1788.12]  Prayer is one
[1788.12 --> 1788.52]  of the most
[1788.52 --> 1789.40]  valuable weapons
[1789.40 --> 1789.98]  that we have.
[1790.54 --> 1791.04]  And that's why
[1791.04 --> 1792.18]  I think that prayer
[1792.18 --> 1793.06]  has to go right
[1793.06 --> 1794.52]  along with
[1794.52 --> 1795.04]  the passage
[1795.04 --> 1795.72]  that we looked
[1795.72 --> 1796.62]  at last week
[1796.62 --> 1797.72]  about the armor
[1797.72 --> 1798.28]  of God.
[1799.04 --> 1799.96]  So remember,
[1800.16 --> 1800.86]  in verse 10,
[1800.92 --> 1801.50]  we'll have it here
[1801.50 --> 1801.94]  on the screen,
[1802.22 --> 1802.94]  this is what Paul
[1802.94 --> 1803.64]  said earlier.
[1803.64 --> 1804.72]  Finally,
[1805.00 --> 1805.58]  be strong
[1805.58 --> 1806.18]  in the Lord
[1806.18 --> 1807.02]  and in his
[1807.02 --> 1807.78]  mighty power,
[1808.54 --> 1809.04]  put on the
[1809.04 --> 1809.82]  full armor
[1809.82 --> 1810.48]  of God
[1810.48 --> 1811.58]  so that you
[1811.58 --> 1812.02]  can take
[1812.02 --> 1812.94]  your stand
[1812.94 --> 1814.02]  against the
[1814.02 --> 1814.96]  devil's schemes.
[1816.02 --> 1816.56]  So we can
[1816.56 --> 1817.44]  stand firm
[1817.44 --> 1818.18]  against the
[1818.18 --> 1818.98]  devil by
[1818.98 --> 1819.60]  putting on
[1819.60 --> 1819.96]  the armor
[1819.96 --> 1820.42]  of God.
[1821.34 --> 1821.74]  And as we
[1821.74 --> 1822.58]  noted last time,
[1822.68 --> 1823.40]  Paul names
[1823.40 --> 1824.96]  both defensive
[1824.96 --> 1827.10]  and offensive
[1827.10 --> 1828.30]  parts of the
[1828.30 --> 1828.54]  armor.
[1829.38 --> 1830.14]  So there are
[1830.14 --> 1830.92]  five pieces
[1830.92 --> 1831.56]  of the armor
[1831.56 --> 1832.46]  that are defensive.
[1832.46 --> 1833.44]  There's the
[1833.44 --> 1834.28]  belt of truth,
[1834.96 --> 1835.90]  the breastplate
[1835.90 --> 1836.54]  of righteousness,
[1837.38 --> 1837.96]  the shoes
[1837.96 --> 1838.76]  of peace,
[1840.00 --> 1841.94]  the shield
[1841.94 --> 1842.52]  of faith,
[1842.66 --> 1842.94]  and then the
[1842.94 --> 1843.42]  helmet of
[1843.42 --> 1843.86]  salvation.
[1844.52 --> 1845.00]  And each
[1845.00 --> 1845.36]  of these
[1845.36 --> 1845.66]  pieces,
[1845.78 --> 1846.52]  as we said,
[1846.80 --> 1847.64]  are actually
[1847.64 --> 1848.66]  describing our
[1848.66 --> 1849.60]  life with
[1849.60 --> 1850.02]  Jesus.
[1850.94 --> 1851.26]  Right?
[1851.32 --> 1851.96]  We come to
[1851.96 --> 1852.40]  know the
[1852.40 --> 1853.26]  truth about
[1853.26 --> 1854.60]  God through
[1854.60 --> 1855.14]  Jesus.
[1857.30 --> 1858.42]  Through faith
[1858.42 --> 1858.98]  in him,
[1860.04 --> 1861.28]  Jesus clothes
[1861.28 --> 1862.06]  us with his
[1862.06 --> 1862.44]  righteousness.
[1863.32 --> 1864.32]  Jesus himself
[1864.32 --> 1865.00]  is our
[1865.00 --> 1865.52]  salvation.
[1865.64 --> 1866.04]  So when we
[1866.04 --> 1867.06]  take up and
[1867.06 --> 1867.72]  we put on
[1867.72 --> 1868.24]  the armor of
[1868.24 --> 1868.66]  God, we
[1868.66 --> 1869.14]  are just,
[1869.50 --> 1870.32]  we are living
[1870.32 --> 1870.92]  out our
[1870.92 --> 1872.02]  union with
[1872.02 --> 1872.54]  Christ.
[1873.76 --> 1875.36]  As the
[1875.36 --> 1875.76]  psalmist
[1875.76 --> 1876.48]  sings in
[1876.48 --> 1877.12]  Psalm 3,
[1878.36 --> 1878.82]  he says,
[1879.02 --> 1879.62]  you, O
[1879.62 --> 1880.44]  Lord, are
[1880.44 --> 1881.28]  a shield
[1881.28 --> 1882.24]  about me,
[1882.88 --> 1884.04]  my glory,
[1884.82 --> 1885.58]  the lifter
[1885.58 --> 1886.64]  of my head.
[1887.64 --> 1887.90]  Right?
[1888.40 --> 1889.32]  We have
[1889.32 --> 1890.22]  a strong
[1890.22 --> 1890.64]  armor,
[1890.78 --> 1891.40]  a defense.
[1891.40 --> 1893.64]  God also
[1893.64 --> 1894.30]  gives us
[1894.30 --> 1894.64]  some
[1894.64 --> 1895.48]  offensive
[1895.48 --> 1896.08]  weapons.
[1896.74 --> 1897.34]  He helps
[1897.34 --> 1897.74]  us with
[1897.74 --> 1898.30]  these weapons
[1898.30 --> 1898.72]  to also
[1898.72 --> 1899.50]  stand firm
[1899.50 --> 1900.06]  against the
[1900.06 --> 1900.38]  devil's
[1900.38 --> 1900.68]  schemes.
[1902.26 --> 1902.98]  There were
[1902.98 --> 1903.72]  five defensive
[1903.72 --> 1904.44]  weapons, but
[1904.44 --> 1904.90]  there are only
[1904.90 --> 1906.02]  two offensive
[1906.02 --> 1906.86]  weapons, and we
[1906.86 --> 1907.44]  find them in
[1907.44 --> 1908.48]  verses 17 and
[1908.48 --> 1908.80]  18.
[1909.80 --> 1910.64]  It says,
[1910.74 --> 1911.28]  Paul writes,
[1911.42 --> 1912.72]  take the
[1912.72 --> 1913.52]  sword of the
[1913.52 --> 1914.40]  spirit, which
[1914.40 --> 1915.00]  is the word
[1915.00 --> 1915.58]  of God,
[1915.58 --> 1917.18]  and pray
[1917.18 --> 1918.38]  in the
[1918.38 --> 1918.70]  spirit.
[1918.70 --> 1920.24]  So the
[1920.24 --> 1920.80]  two offensive
[1920.80 --> 1921.50]  weapons are
[1921.50 --> 1922.04]  the word
[1922.04 --> 1922.66]  of God
[1922.66 --> 1923.88]  and prayer,
[1924.52 --> 1925.14]  the sword
[1925.14 --> 1925.42]  of the
[1925.42 --> 1925.76]  spirit,
[1926.44 --> 1927.28]  and praying
[1927.28 --> 1928.26]  in the
[1928.26 --> 1928.56]  spirit.
[1929.74 --> 1929.98]  And so
[1929.98 --> 1930.66]  today, let
[1930.66 --> 1931.46]  us focus on
[1931.46 --> 1932.14]  these two
[1932.14 --> 1933.18]  offensive pieces
[1933.18 --> 1933.80]  of the armor
[1933.80 --> 1934.98]  as we wrap
[1934.98 --> 1935.64]  up our
[1935.64 --> 1936.66]  study in
[1936.66 --> 1937.02]  the book
[1937.02 --> 1937.68]  of Ephesians.
[1938.46 --> 1938.96]  I think
[1938.96 --> 1939.60]  this is a
[1939.60 --> 1940.68]  wonderful way
[1940.68 --> 1941.26]  to end,
[1941.78 --> 1942.26]  well, of course,
[1942.42 --> 1943.20]  it's the word
[1943.20 --> 1943.80]  of God, and
[1943.80 --> 1944.22]  Paul wrote
[1944.22 --> 1945.10]  it, but
[1945.10 --> 1945.76]  look how he
[1945.76 --> 1946.20]  ends.
[1947.02 --> 1947.64]  Word and
[1947.64 --> 1948.52]  prayer, right?
[1948.56 --> 1949.24]  Isn't that what
[1949.24 --> 1949.68]  the Christian
[1949.68 --> 1950.24]  life is all
[1950.24 --> 1950.52]  about?
[1951.10 --> 1951.60]  How do we
[1951.60 --> 1952.10]  live out the
[1952.10 --> 1952.68]  Christian life?
[1953.04 --> 1953.54]  It's word
[1953.54 --> 1954.84]  and prayer.
[1955.68 --> 1956.26]  So let's
[1956.26 --> 1956.66]  look at these
[1956.66 --> 1957.26]  two things.
[1959.02 --> 1959.74]  The first
[1959.74 --> 1960.64]  offensive piece
[1960.64 --> 1961.28]  of the armor
[1961.28 --> 1962.98]  is the
[1962.98 --> 1963.70]  sword of the
[1963.70 --> 1964.76]  spirit, which
[1964.76 --> 1965.34]  is the word
[1965.34 --> 1965.82]  of God.
[1966.56 --> 1967.22]  Paul mentions
[1967.22 --> 1967.72]  the sword of
[1967.72 --> 1968.14]  the spirit in
[1968.14 --> 1969.04]  verse 17 in
[1969.04 --> 1969.64]  that list of
[1969.64 --> 1970.22]  the armor that
[1970.22 --> 1970.62]  we looked at
[1970.62 --> 1971.34]  last week, and
[1971.34 --> 1972.32]  we mentioned
[1972.32 --> 1972.82]  it briefly.
[1973.20 --> 1974.26]  But he
[1974.26 --> 1975.00]  comes back to
[1975.00 --> 1975.50]  it in this
[1975.50 --> 1976.40]  passage today.
[1976.58 --> 1977.06]  Look at
[1977.06 --> 1977.78]  verses 19
[1977.78 --> 1978.82]  and 20, and
[1978.82 --> 1980.08]  also notice how
[1980.08 --> 1981.04]  he ties it
[1981.04 --> 1982.60]  together with
[1982.60 --> 1983.06]  prayer.
[1984.02 --> 1984.92]  So he says
[1984.92 --> 1985.40]  this, Paul
[1985.40 --> 1985.72]  writes,
[1986.06 --> 1987.02]  pray also for
[1987.02 --> 1988.08]  me that
[1988.08 --> 1989.54]  whenever I
[1989.54 --> 1991.70]  speak, words
[1991.70 --> 1992.36]  may be given
[1992.36 --> 1993.26]  me so that I
[1993.26 --> 1994.00]  will fearlessly
[1994.00 --> 1994.84]  make known the
[1994.84 --> 1996.00]  mystery of the
[1996.00 --> 1997.08]  gospel, for
[1997.08 --> 1998.52]  which I am an
[1998.52 --> 1999.26]  ambassador in
[1999.26 --> 1999.62]  chains.
[2000.00 --> 2000.62]  Pray that I
[2000.62 --> 2001.56]  may declare it
[2001.56 --> 2003.18]  fearlessly as
[2003.18 --> 2003.88]  as I should.
[2005.30 --> 2006.06]  So Paul
[2006.06 --> 2007.24]  says, pray
[2007.24 --> 2007.68]  for me.
[2008.72 --> 2008.92]  Right?
[2008.96 --> 2009.20]  This is
[2009.20 --> 2009.64]  something that
[2009.64 --> 2010.16]  all of us
[2010.16 --> 2010.84]  say, you
[2010.84 --> 2011.02]  know, at
[2011.02 --> 2011.46]  one time or
[2011.46 --> 2011.72]  another.
[2012.42 --> 2012.98]  Would you
[2012.98 --> 2013.64]  pray for me?
[2014.72 --> 2015.62]  I need
[2015.62 --> 2016.44]  God to
[2016.44 --> 2017.00]  come to
[2017.00 --> 2017.70]  my aid.
[2017.96 --> 2018.72]  I need
[2018.72 --> 2018.98]  his
[2018.98 --> 2019.56]  intervention
[2019.56 --> 2020.30]  and help.
[2020.60 --> 2020.90]  Pray for
[2020.90 --> 2021.10]  me.
[2021.86 --> 2022.46]  But when
[2022.46 --> 2023.16]  Paul asks
[2023.16 --> 2023.78]  for prayer
[2023.78 --> 2024.70]  for himself
[2024.70 --> 2026.44]  here, where
[2026.44 --> 2027.04]  is he?
[2028.04 --> 2028.52]  Do you
[2028.52 --> 2028.84]  remember?
[2029.02 --> 2029.28]  What's it
[2029.28 --> 2029.48]  say?
[2030.28 --> 2030.80]  He's in
[2030.80 --> 2031.20]  prison.
[2032.14 --> 2033.00]  He is in
[2033.00 --> 2033.54]  chains.
[2033.68 --> 2034.90]  He is not
[2034.90 --> 2035.34]  comfortable,
[2035.72 --> 2036.42]  to say the
[2036.42 --> 2036.64]  least.
[2036.78 --> 2037.26]  He is
[2037.26 --> 2037.72]  suffering.
[2038.18 --> 2038.78]  He is in
[2038.78 --> 2039.10]  trouble.
[2039.92 --> 2040.46]  But what's
[2040.46 --> 2041.20]  amazing is
[2041.20 --> 2041.60]  that Paul
[2041.60 --> 2042.34]  doesn't say,
[2043.06 --> 2043.48]  hey, by
[2043.48 --> 2044.02]  the way,
[2044.40 --> 2045.10]  pray that I
[2045.10 --> 2045.76]  would get
[2045.76 --> 2046.98]  out of
[2046.98 --> 2047.36]  prison.
[2048.18 --> 2048.76]  That's what
[2048.76 --> 2049.02]  I would
[2049.02 --> 2049.24]  pray.
[2050.50 --> 2051.34]  He says,
[2051.70 --> 2053.26]  he doesn't
[2053.26 --> 2053.60]  say anything
[2053.60 --> 2054.14]  about that.
[2054.60 --> 2055.12]  He says,
[2055.22 --> 2056.56]  pray that I
[2056.56 --> 2057.14]  would speak
[2057.14 --> 2057.74]  the word
[2057.74 --> 2058.68]  of God
[2058.68 --> 2060.00]  and make
[2060.00 --> 2060.78]  known the
[2060.78 --> 2061.26]  mystery of
[2061.26 --> 2061.68]  the gospel.
[2062.76 --> 2062.92]  Right?
[2063.10 --> 2063.96]  Why is
[2063.96 --> 2065.12]  that Paul's
[2065.12 --> 2065.94]  prayer request?
[2066.74 --> 2067.06]  It's because
[2067.06 --> 2068.60]  Paul knows
[2068.60 --> 2069.42]  that while
[2069.42 --> 2070.36]  he is
[2070.36 --> 2071.08]  chained,
[2071.18 --> 2071.68]  he is in
[2071.68 --> 2072.00]  prison,
[2072.30 --> 2072.68]  the word
[2072.68 --> 2073.04]  of God
[2073.04 --> 2073.52]  is not.
[2074.88 --> 2075.70]  He can
[2075.70 --> 2077.14]  still wield
[2077.14 --> 2077.92]  the sword
[2077.92 --> 2078.36]  of the
[2078.36 --> 2078.70]  spirit,
[2078.88 --> 2080.08]  even from
[2080.08 --> 2080.50]  prison.
[2081.24 --> 2081.46]  Right?
[2081.50 --> 2081.68]  I mean,
[2081.72 --> 2082.24]  Paul's writing
[2082.24 --> 2082.68]  this very
[2082.68 --> 2083.02]  letter.
[2083.64 --> 2083.98]  The word
[2083.98 --> 2084.30]  of God
[2084.30 --> 2084.82]  has gotten
[2084.82 --> 2085.20]  out.
[2085.66 --> 2086.14]  This word
[2086.14 --> 2086.90]  of God
[2086.90 --> 2087.92]  has gone
[2087.92 --> 2088.28]  out to
[2088.28 --> 2088.72]  all the
[2088.72 --> 2089.02]  churches
[2089.02 --> 2089.64]  in Ephesus.
[2090.56 --> 2090.84]  They were
[2090.84 --> 2091.60]  brothers and
[2091.60 --> 2092.44]  sisters gathered
[2092.44 --> 2093.18]  reading the
[2093.18 --> 2093.68]  word of God,
[2093.74 --> 2094.70]  being encouraged
[2094.70 --> 2095.76]  by the
[2095.76 --> 2096.16]  gospel,
[2096.66 --> 2097.40]  being enabled
[2097.40 --> 2098.28]  to stand
[2098.28 --> 2099.06]  firm
[2099.06 --> 2100.08]  in the
[2100.08 --> 2100.60]  faith.
[2101.86 --> 2102.44]  So Paul
[2102.44 --> 2103.16]  wants the
[2103.16 --> 2103.78]  word to
[2103.78 --> 2104.20]  go out
[2104.20 --> 2105.06]  because it's
[2105.06 --> 2105.64]  the word
[2105.64 --> 2106.24]  of the
[2106.24 --> 2106.80]  living God
[2106.80 --> 2108.08]  that makes
[2108.08 --> 2108.84]  things happen.
[2110.62 --> 2110.82]  Right?
[2110.92 --> 2111.82]  Our words,
[2111.90 --> 2112.26]  think about
[2112.26 --> 2113.10]  our words
[2113.10 --> 2113.60]  that we speak
[2113.60 --> 2114.10]  every day.
[2115.00 --> 2115.46]  We make
[2115.46 --> 2116.20]  all kinds
[2116.20 --> 2116.54]  of things
[2116.54 --> 2116.98]  happen
[2116.98 --> 2117.94]  with our
[2117.94 --> 2118.40]  words.
[2119.52 --> 2120.38]  Our words
[2120.38 --> 2121.86]  can hurt.
[2123.12 --> 2123.50]  They can
[2123.50 --> 2124.12]  also heal.
[2125.18 --> 2125.94]  Our words
[2125.94 --> 2127.02]  can tear
[2127.02 --> 2127.54]  down
[2127.54 --> 2128.92]  and they
[2128.92 --> 2129.46]  can build
[2129.46 --> 2129.84]  up.
[2131.22 --> 2132.28]  How much
[2132.28 --> 2133.18]  more the
[2133.18 --> 2133.84]  word of
[2133.84 --> 2134.52]  the one
[2134.52 --> 2135.80]  God who
[2135.80 --> 2136.96]  made all
[2136.96 --> 2137.52]  things and
[2137.52 --> 2138.62]  sustains all
[2138.62 --> 2139.12]  things and
[2139.12 --> 2139.50]  holds them
[2139.50 --> 2139.88]  together.
[2141.02 --> 2141.24]  Right?
[2141.28 --> 2141.68]  God says,
[2141.68 --> 2142.26]  let there
[2142.26 --> 2142.96]  be light.
[2143.46 --> 2143.60]  Right?
[2144.28 --> 2144.80]  Stars,
[2146.10 --> 2146.60]  suns,
[2146.74 --> 2147.50]  burst forth.
[2148.82 --> 2149.34]  And then he
[2149.34 --> 2149.50]  says,
[2149.58 --> 2149.84]  let there
[2149.84 --> 2150.66]  be animals,
[2151.62 --> 2152.84]  all kinds
[2152.84 --> 2154.02]  of animals.
[2156.02 --> 2156.92]  Get up
[2156.92 --> 2157.64]  and walk.
[2158.92 --> 2159.24]  And the
[2159.24 --> 2159.96]  lame man
[2159.96 --> 2161.02]  stands up
[2161.02 --> 2162.44]  who's never
[2162.44 --> 2163.08]  walked before
[2163.08 --> 2164.28]  and walks.
[2165.50 --> 2166.34]  Come out
[2166.34 --> 2166.78]  of him
[2166.78 --> 2168.08]  and the
[2168.08 --> 2168.46]  demons
[2168.46 --> 2169.00]  flee.
[2170.44 --> 2171.00]  Quiet,
[2171.18 --> 2171.94]  be still
[2171.94 --> 2173.04]  and the
[2173.04 --> 2174.00]  raging wind
[2174.00 --> 2174.38]  and the
[2174.38 --> 2174.96]  waves
[2174.96 --> 2176.82]  die down.
[2178.16 --> 2178.80]  Lazarus,
[2178.88 --> 2179.42]  come out
[2179.42 --> 2180.44]  and a
[2180.44 --> 2181.04]  dead man
[2181.04 --> 2181.56]  walks out
[2181.56 --> 2181.78]  of the
[2181.78 --> 2182.04]  tomb.
[2182.52 --> 2182.64]  Right?
[2182.84 --> 2183.60]  When God
[2183.60 --> 2184.42]  speaks,
[2185.00 --> 2185.80]  things happen.
[2186.64 --> 2187.02]  The word
[2187.02 --> 2187.74]  of God
[2187.74 --> 2188.94]  is powerful.
[2188.94 --> 2191.24]  Hebrews
[2191.24 --> 2191.90]  chapter 4
[2191.90 --> 2192.50]  verse 12
[2192.50 --> 2193.52]  says this,
[2194.58 --> 2194.84]  for the
[2194.84 --> 2195.34]  word of
[2195.34 --> 2195.68]  God
[2195.68 --> 2196.28]  is alive
[2196.28 --> 2196.86]  and active,
[2197.38 --> 2197.70]  sharper
[2197.70 --> 2198.28]  than any
[2198.28 --> 2198.98]  double-edged
[2198.98 --> 2199.50]  sword.
[2200.00 --> 2200.32]  It
[2200.32 --> 2200.98]  penetrates
[2200.98 --> 2201.62]  even to
[2201.62 --> 2202.16]  dividing
[2202.16 --> 2202.64]  soul
[2202.64 --> 2203.26]  and spirit,
[2203.80 --> 2204.12]  joints
[2204.12 --> 2204.60]  and marrow.
[2204.76 --> 2205.20]  It judges
[2205.20 --> 2205.74]  the thoughts
[2205.74 --> 2206.26]  and attitudes
[2206.26 --> 2206.68]  of the
[2206.68 --> 2207.06]  heart.
[2207.88 --> 2207.98]  Right?
[2208.14 --> 2208.78]  The word
[2208.78 --> 2209.44]  of God
[2209.44 --> 2210.62]  is the
[2210.62 --> 2210.94]  sword
[2210.94 --> 2211.22]  of the
[2211.22 --> 2211.48]  spirit.
[2212.32 --> 2212.96]  God's
[2212.96 --> 2213.34]  word
[2213.34 --> 2213.78]  is the
[2213.78 --> 2214.34]  spirit's
[2214.34 --> 2214.72]  word.
[2215.24 --> 2215.76]  And it
[2215.76 --> 2216.24]  is
[2216.24 --> 2217.26]  alive.
[2218.00 --> 2218.52]  And it
[2218.52 --> 2219.12]  is active.
[2219.72 --> 2220.14]  And it
[2220.14 --> 2220.66]  is able
[2220.66 --> 2221.42]  to penetrate
[2221.42 --> 2222.68]  any form
[2222.68 --> 2223.14]  of darkness.
[2224.26 --> 2225.02]  It is
[2225.02 --> 2225.70]  able to
[2225.70 --> 2226.72]  break through
[2226.72 --> 2228.22]  any defense
[2228.22 --> 2229.50]  raised against
[2229.50 --> 2230.08]  the knowledge
[2230.08 --> 2230.62]  of God.
[2231.48 --> 2232.16]  It is able
[2232.16 --> 2232.56]  to break
[2232.56 --> 2232.96]  through any
[2232.96 --> 2234.18]  lie about
[2234.18 --> 2234.74]  who God
[2234.74 --> 2235.06]  is and
[2235.06 --> 2235.46]  what God
[2235.46 --> 2236.12]  is like.
[2237.18 --> 2238.44]  It reveals
[2238.44 --> 2239.96]  who we
[2239.96 --> 2241.34]  are and
[2241.34 --> 2241.70]  what it
[2241.70 --> 2242.72]  truly means
[2242.72 --> 2243.08]  to be
[2243.08 --> 2243.44]  human.
[2244.46 --> 2245.00]  It is
[2245.00 --> 2246.22]  able to
[2246.22 --> 2247.04]  take us
[2247.04 --> 2247.40]  who are
[2247.40 --> 2247.92]  spiritually
[2247.92 --> 2248.50]  dead and
[2248.50 --> 2249.84]  sin to
[2249.84 --> 2250.70]  raise us
[2250.70 --> 2252.04]  up and
[2252.04 --> 2252.38]  make us
[2252.38 --> 2252.98]  children of
[2252.98 --> 2253.36]  God and
[2253.36 --> 2253.72]  to bring
[2253.72 --> 2254.56]  us from
[2254.56 --> 2255.26]  the kingdom
[2255.26 --> 2255.76]  of darkness
[2255.76 --> 2256.56]  into the
[2256.56 --> 2257.02]  kingdom of
[2257.02 --> 2257.28]  light.
[2258.40 --> 2258.94]  So Paul
[2258.94 --> 2259.58]  says take
[2259.58 --> 2260.22]  up the
[2260.22 --> 2260.62]  sword of
[2260.62 --> 2261.06]  the spirit.
[2261.06 --> 2261.68]  Speak
[2261.68 --> 2262.26]  the word
[2262.26 --> 2262.82]  of God
[2262.82 --> 2264.18]  and watch
[2264.18 --> 2265.76]  what happens.
[2266.94 --> 2267.46]  When
[2267.46 --> 2268.80]  God's
[2268.80 --> 2269.76]  people speak
[2269.76 --> 2270.42]  God's word
[2270.42 --> 2270.94]  something
[2270.94 --> 2271.84]  redemptive
[2271.84 --> 2273.26]  always happens.
[2274.20 --> 2275.08]  That's the
[2275.08 --> 2276.12]  promise of
[2276.12 --> 2277.04]  Isaiah 55.
[2277.04 --> 2278.28]  I love
[2278.28 --> 2278.88]  this passage
[2278.88 --> 2279.40]  from Isaiah.
[2279.78 --> 2280.12]  This is
[2280.12 --> 2280.38]  what it
[2280.38 --> 2280.70]  says.
[2281.38 --> 2282.08]  As the
[2282.08 --> 2282.60]  rain and
[2282.60 --> 2282.96]  the snow
[2282.96 --> 2283.50]  come down
[2283.50 --> 2284.08]  from heaven
[2284.08 --> 2284.70]  and do
[2284.70 --> 2285.34]  not return
[2285.34 --> 2285.76]  to it
[2285.76 --> 2286.08]  without
[2286.08 --> 2286.56]  watering
[2286.56 --> 2287.22]  the earth
[2287.22 --> 2287.98]  and making
[2287.98 --> 2288.44]  it bud
[2288.44 --> 2289.10]  and flourish
[2289.10 --> 2290.44]  so that it
[2290.44 --> 2291.16]  yields seed
[2291.16 --> 2291.50]  for the
[2291.50 --> 2292.42]  sower and
[2292.42 --> 2293.02]  bread for
[2293.02 --> 2293.50]  the eater.
[2294.38 --> 2295.08]  So is
[2295.08 --> 2295.88]  my word
[2295.88 --> 2296.68]  that goes
[2296.68 --> 2297.28]  out from
[2297.28 --> 2297.76]  my mouth.
[2297.86 --> 2298.08]  It will
[2298.08 --> 2298.84]  not return
[2298.84 --> 2299.22]  to me
[2299.22 --> 2300.28]  empty but
[2300.28 --> 2301.10]  will accomplish
[2301.10 --> 2302.08]  what I
[2302.08 --> 2303.20]  desire and
[2303.20 --> 2303.90]  achieve the
[2303.90 --> 2304.88]  purpose for
[2304.88 --> 2305.88]  which I
[2305.88 --> 2306.46]  sent it.
[2307.90 --> 2308.96]  Maybe not
[2308.96 --> 2309.66]  immediately
[2309.66 --> 2311.08]  right maybe
[2311.08 --> 2312.12]  not visibly
[2312.12 --> 2313.58]  but the
[2313.58 --> 2314.30]  word spoken
[2314.30 --> 2314.72]  in the
[2314.72 --> 2315.38]  world makes
[2315.38 --> 2316.20]  things happen
[2316.20 --> 2316.58]  in the
[2316.58 --> 2316.86]  world.
[2317.74 --> 2319.14]  It accomplishes
[2319.14 --> 2320.54]  the purposes
[2320.54 --> 2321.12]  for which
[2321.12 --> 2322.38]  God has
[2322.38 --> 2322.72]  sent it.
[2322.76 --> 2323.60]  His redemptive
[2323.60 --> 2324.84]  purposes in
[2324.84 --> 2325.52]  the world.
[2326.56 --> 2326.90]  And when
[2326.90 --> 2327.48]  Paul tells
[2327.48 --> 2328.06]  us to take
[2328.06 --> 2328.56]  up the
[2328.56 --> 2328.84]  sword of
[2328.84 --> 2329.28]  the spirit
[2329.28 --> 2330.56]  he's telling
[2330.56 --> 2331.22]  us to do
[2331.22 --> 2332.20]  exactly what
[2332.20 --> 2332.62]  our Lord
[2332.62 --> 2333.28]  Jesus Christ
[2333.28 --> 2333.56]  did.
[2334.56 --> 2335.14]  In the
[2335.14 --> 2335.74]  gospels
[2335.74 --> 2336.72]  Jesus has
[2336.72 --> 2337.04]  to tell
[2337.04 --> 2338.02]  Peter put
[2338.02 --> 2338.42]  away your
[2338.42 --> 2338.74]  sword.
[2339.04 --> 2339.54]  His real
[2339.54 --> 2340.24]  physical
[2340.24 --> 2340.74]  sword.
[2340.98 --> 2341.30]  Put it
[2341.30 --> 2341.46]  away.
[2341.54 --> 2341.78]  That's not
[2341.78 --> 2342.22]  the way
[2342.22 --> 2342.52]  of the
[2342.52 --> 2342.86]  kingdom.
[2343.92 --> 2344.54]  But Jesus
[2344.54 --> 2345.14]  is always
[2345.14 --> 2345.84]  wielding the
[2345.84 --> 2346.32]  sword of
[2346.32 --> 2346.72]  the spirit
[2346.72 --> 2347.08]  the word
[2347.08 --> 2347.50]  of God.
[2348.36 --> 2348.70]  Remember
[2348.70 --> 2349.20]  last week
[2349.20 --> 2349.68]  I mentioned
[2349.68 --> 2350.62]  how Jesus
[2350.62 --> 2351.18]  was in the
[2351.18 --> 2351.52]  wilderness
[2351.52 --> 2352.06]  and he
[2352.06 --> 2352.68]  was wrestling
[2352.68 --> 2353.30]  with Satan
[2353.30 --> 2354.66]  and he
[2354.66 --> 2355.46]  drove Satan
[2355.46 --> 2356.32]  away by
[2356.32 --> 2357.30]  knowing God's
[2357.30 --> 2357.62]  word.
[2358.70 --> 2359.00]  And so
[2359.00 --> 2360.06]  three rounds
[2360.06 --> 2360.42]  of that
[2360.42 --> 2361.18]  wrestling match
[2361.18 --> 2361.46]  and in
[2361.46 --> 2362.18]  round three
[2362.18 --> 2363.68]  with Satan
[2363.68 --> 2364.30]  in Matthew
[2364.30 --> 2365.20]  chapter four
[2365.20 --> 2366.42]  Jesus he
[2366.42 --> 2367.40]  finally says
[2367.40 --> 2368.56]  away from
[2368.56 --> 2369.12]  me Satan
[2369.12 --> 2370.28]  for it
[2370.28 --> 2371.24]  is written
[2371.24 --> 2372.88]  worship the
[2372.88 --> 2373.24]  Lord your
[2373.24 --> 2373.76]  God and
[2373.76 --> 2374.12]  serve him
[2374.12 --> 2374.44]  only.
[2374.86 --> 2375.04]  And what
[2375.04 --> 2375.40]  happened?
[2376.50 --> 2377.12]  The devil
[2377.12 --> 2377.58]  left him.
[2378.98 --> 2379.54]  In his
[2379.54 --> 2380.30]  struggle with
[2380.30 --> 2381.02]  those stubborn
[2381.02 --> 2382.68]  and hostile
[2382.68 --> 2384.56]  Pharisees he's
[2384.56 --> 2385.18]  always saying
[2385.18 --> 2386.68]  to them it
[2386.68 --> 2387.22]  is written
[2387.22 --> 2388.54]  or have
[2388.54 --> 2389.00]  you not
[2389.00 --> 2389.66]  read as
[2389.66 --> 2390.20]  any quotes
[2390.20 --> 2390.54]  from the
[2390.54 --> 2390.94]  scriptures.
[2392.18 --> 2392.94]  Then we
[2392.94 --> 2393.40]  read about
[2393.40 --> 2393.94]  this account
[2393.94 --> 2394.36]  in Luke
[2394.36 --> 2395.08]  chapter 10.
[2396.18 --> 2396.52]  In Luke
[2396.52 --> 2397.08]  chapter 10
[2397.08 --> 2398.12]  Jesus sends
[2398.12 --> 2400.56]  out 72
[2400.56 --> 2401.28]  of his
[2401.28 --> 2401.96]  disciples on
[2401.96 --> 2402.24]  a mission
[2402.24 --> 2403.04]  trip and
[2403.04 --> 2403.46]  he tells
[2403.46 --> 2403.74]  them that
[2403.74 --> 2404.00]  they are
[2404.00 --> 2404.58]  simply to
[2404.58 --> 2405.40]  announce the
[2405.40 --> 2405.80]  gospel.
[2406.64 --> 2407.08]  They are to
[2407.08 --> 2407.58]  go from
[2407.58 --> 2408.30]  town to
[2408.30 --> 2408.68]  town,
[2409.02 --> 2409.36]  they are to
[2409.36 --> 2409.72]  go from
[2409.72 --> 2410.08]  house to
[2410.08 --> 2410.60]  house and
[2410.60 --> 2410.88]  then they
[2410.88 --> 2411.22]  are to
[2411.22 --> 2412.18]  say the
[2412.18 --> 2412.92]  kingdom of
[2412.92 --> 2413.52]  God has
[2413.52 --> 2413.98]  come near
[2413.98 --> 2414.38]  to you.
[2416.08 --> 2416.82]  So after
[2416.82 --> 2417.20]  they do
[2417.20 --> 2417.68]  this the
[2417.68 --> 2418.82]  72 they
[2418.82 --> 2420.04]  return with
[2420.04 --> 2420.68]  this news
[2420.68 --> 2421.58]  of all
[2421.58 --> 2422.28]  kinds of
[2422.28 --> 2423.02]  kingdom things
[2423.02 --> 2423.46]  are happening.
[2423.62 --> 2424.06]  People are
[2424.06 --> 2424.98]  healed, people
[2424.98 --> 2425.68]  are freed
[2425.68 --> 2426.16]  from all
[2426.16 --> 2426.78]  kinds of
[2426.78 --> 2427.70]  bondage and
[2427.70 --> 2428.20]  then here's
[2428.20 --> 2428.48]  what he
[2428.48 --> 2428.82]  says.
[2429.58 --> 2430.18]  The 72
[2430.18 --> 2430.94]  return with
[2430.94 --> 2431.80]  joy and
[2431.80 --> 2432.10]  they said
[2432.10 --> 2432.86]  Lord even
[2432.86 --> 2433.56]  the demons
[2433.56 --> 2434.06]  submit to
[2434.06 --> 2434.34]  us in
[2434.34 --> 2434.80]  your name.
[2436.06 --> 2436.42]  And Jesus
[2436.42 --> 2437.58]  replied I
[2437.58 --> 2438.26]  saw Satan
[2438.26 --> 2439.62]  fall like
[2439.62 --> 2440.38]  lightning from
[2440.38 --> 2440.68]  heaven.
[2440.68 --> 2442.28]  the
[2442.28 --> 2445.26]  disciples had
[2445.26 --> 2445.70]  been sent
[2445.70 --> 2446.20]  out with
[2446.20 --> 2446.82]  the word
[2446.82 --> 2447.98]  of God,
[2448.04 --> 2448.50]  the sword
[2448.50 --> 2448.82]  of the
[2448.82 --> 2450.16]  spirit and
[2450.16 --> 2451.06]  redemptive
[2451.06 --> 2451.86]  things
[2451.86 --> 2452.84]  happened.
[2453.62 --> 2454.32]  People are
[2454.32 --> 2454.98]  set free,
[2455.82 --> 2456.36]  the kingdom
[2456.36 --> 2457.30]  of God
[2457.30 --> 2458.50]  comes near.
[2460.82 --> 2461.54]  And you
[2461.54 --> 2462.10]  know that's
[2462.10 --> 2463.76]  why the
[2463.76 --> 2464.42]  devil works
[2464.42 --> 2465.36]  so cleverly
[2465.36 --> 2465.80]  and so
[2465.80 --> 2466.54]  consistently
[2466.54 --> 2467.30]  to keep
[2467.30 --> 2467.72]  us out
[2467.72 --> 2468.02]  of the
[2468.02 --> 2468.28]  Bible.
[2468.28 --> 2471.72]  The
[2471.72 --> 2472.44]  Bible on
[2472.44 --> 2473.06]  a shelf
[2473.06 --> 2474.40]  is of
[2474.40 --> 2475.36]  no threat
[2475.36 --> 2475.98]  to the
[2475.98 --> 2476.28]  spiritual
[2476.28 --> 2476.92]  forces of
[2476.92 --> 2477.30]  evil in
[2477.30 --> 2477.60]  the heavenly
[2477.60 --> 2478.14]  places.
[2478.70 --> 2479.30]  Because if
[2479.30 --> 2479.60]  we don't
[2479.60 --> 2480.20]  proclaim the
[2480.20 --> 2480.60]  mystery of
[2480.60 --> 2481.06]  the gospel,
[2482.10 --> 2482.60]  like okay,
[2482.72 --> 2483.42]  we might be
[2483.42 --> 2483.94]  safe, we
[2483.94 --> 2484.34]  might have
[2484.34 --> 2484.84]  our armor,
[2485.02 --> 2485.36]  we have
[2485.36 --> 2485.74]  our life
[2485.74 --> 2486.30]  in Christ,
[2486.60 --> 2487.56]  but if
[2487.56 --> 2488.00]  we're not
[2488.00 --> 2488.92]  proclaiming
[2488.92 --> 2489.46]  the gospel,
[2489.56 --> 2489.72]  if we're
[2489.72 --> 2490.34]  not wielding
[2490.34 --> 2490.98]  our sword,
[2491.08 --> 2491.28]  we're not
[2491.28 --> 2492.02]  using it,
[2493.18 --> 2493.62]  redemptive
[2493.62 --> 2494.50]  things aren't
[2494.50 --> 2494.74]  going to
[2494.74 --> 2495.16]  happen in
[2495.16 --> 2495.52]  the world.
[2495.66 --> 2495.96]  We're not
[2495.96 --> 2496.66]  announcing the
[2496.66 --> 2497.04]  hope and
[2497.04 --> 2497.48]  joy of the
[2497.48 --> 2498.26]  gospel so
[2498.26 --> 2499.10]  that others
[2499.10 --> 2500.50]  are set
[2500.50 --> 2501.32]  free, so
[2501.32 --> 2501.62]  that the
[2501.62 --> 2502.58]  kingdom comes
[2502.58 --> 2503.36]  near to
[2503.36 --> 2503.66]  them.
[2504.86 --> 2505.24]  And a
[2505.24 --> 2505.72]  church that
[2505.72 --> 2506.06]  doesn't
[2506.06 --> 2506.82]  proclaim the
[2506.82 --> 2507.30]  boundless
[2507.30 --> 2507.82]  riches of
[2507.82 --> 2509.10]  Christ is
[2509.10 --> 2509.52]  of no
[2509.52 --> 2510.08]  threat to
[2510.08 --> 2510.38]  Satan.
[2511.54 --> 2512.26]  And it
[2512.26 --> 2513.00]  doesn't bring
[2513.00 --> 2513.92]  redemption into
[2513.92 --> 2514.48]  the world.
[2515.40 --> 2516.12]  But when we
[2516.12 --> 2516.94]  speak God's
[2516.94 --> 2517.62]  word, the
[2517.62 --> 2518.26]  kingdom of
[2518.26 --> 2519.22]  God draws
[2519.22 --> 2519.50]  near.
[2521.80 --> 2522.64]  So that's
[2522.64 --> 2523.02]  our first
[2523.02 --> 2523.34]  weapon.
[2523.52 --> 2523.88]  Here's our
[2523.88 --> 2524.42]  second one.
[2525.28 --> 2525.66]  There's a
[2525.66 --> 2526.48]  second offensive
[2526.48 --> 2527.52]  weapon that
[2527.52 --> 2527.98]  Paul talks
[2527.98 --> 2528.34]  about in
[2528.34 --> 2529.08]  this final
[2529.08 --> 2529.64]  passage of
[2529.64 --> 2530.20]  Ephesians,
[2530.56 --> 2531.36]  and it is
[2531.36 --> 2531.96]  prayer in
[2531.96 --> 2532.32]  the spirit.
[2533.36 --> 2533.98]  So again,
[2534.06 --> 2534.38]  look with
[2534.38 --> 2535.02]  me at
[2535.02 --> 2536.06]  verse 18.
[2538.86 --> 2539.68]  And pray
[2539.68 --> 2540.00]  in the
[2540.00 --> 2540.26]  spirit.
[2540.76 --> 2541.24]  Take up
[2541.24 --> 2541.92]  the sword
[2541.92 --> 2543.46]  of the
[2543.46 --> 2543.72]  spirit,
[2543.84 --> 2544.20]  which is the
[2544.20 --> 2544.46]  word of
[2544.46 --> 2544.80]  God,
[2545.24 --> 2546.40]  and pray
[2546.40 --> 2547.32]  in the
[2547.32 --> 2547.68]  spirit.
[2548.44 --> 2549.30]  In the
[2549.30 --> 2549.66]  spirit.
[2550.86 --> 2551.78]  It reminds
[2551.78 --> 2552.44]  us that our
[2552.44 --> 2553.80]  prayers are
[2553.80 --> 2554.98]  always dependent
[2554.98 --> 2555.58]  on the
[2555.58 --> 2556.16]  spirit.
[2557.40 --> 2557.62]  You know,
[2557.68 --> 2558.00]  often,
[2558.90 --> 2559.42]  for me,
[2559.54 --> 2559.86]  I think,
[2560.08 --> 2560.58]  probably for
[2560.58 --> 2560.94]  a lot of
[2560.94 --> 2561.16]  us,
[2561.24 --> 2561.64]  when we
[2561.64 --> 2562.60]  come before
[2562.60 --> 2563.06]  God in
[2563.06 --> 2563.34]  prayer,
[2564.22 --> 2564.82]  we don't
[2564.82 --> 2565.28]  even know
[2565.28 --> 2565.56]  what to
[2565.56 --> 2565.96]  pray for.
[2567.30 --> 2567.92]  We don't
[2567.92 --> 2568.26]  know what
[2568.26 --> 2568.86]  is best.
[2569.72 --> 2569.94]  Like,
[2569.94 --> 2570.64]  what do I
[2570.64 --> 2571.18]  pray for?
[2571.82 --> 2572.36]  We don't
[2572.36 --> 2572.64]  know what
[2572.64 --> 2573.10]  God's will
[2573.10 --> 2573.48]  is.
[2574.74 --> 2575.18]  So what do
[2575.18 --> 2575.68]  we pray for?
[2575.74 --> 2575.98]  We don't
[2575.98 --> 2576.26]  know what
[2576.26 --> 2576.76]  God is
[2576.76 --> 2577.78]  intending,
[2578.00 --> 2578.40]  what he
[2578.40 --> 2578.96]  wills to
[2578.96 --> 2579.26]  do in
[2579.26 --> 2579.68]  the world.
[2580.72 --> 2581.28]  So we
[2581.28 --> 2581.74]  pray in
[2581.74 --> 2582.20]  the spirit.
[2582.20 --> 2584.20]  Romans
[2584.20 --> 2585.08]  chapter 8
[2585.08 --> 2586.86]  says this.
[2587.18 --> 2587.58]  The spirit
[2587.58 --> 2588.26]  helps us in
[2588.26 --> 2588.78]  our weakness.
[2589.24 --> 2589.68]  It says we
[2589.68 --> 2590.10]  are weak.
[2590.94 --> 2591.94]  Spirit helps
[2591.94 --> 2592.24]  us.
[2592.88 --> 2593.22]  We do
[2593.22 --> 2593.72]  not know
[2593.72 --> 2594.08]  what we
[2594.08 --> 2594.36]  ought to
[2594.36 --> 2594.86]  pray for,
[2595.44 --> 2595.94]  but the
[2595.94 --> 2596.26]  spirit
[2596.26 --> 2596.92]  himself
[2596.92 --> 2597.78]  intercedes
[2597.78 --> 2598.58]  for us
[2598.58 --> 2599.74]  through
[2599.74 --> 2600.60]  wordless
[2600.60 --> 2601.04]  groans.
[2601.12 --> 2601.52]  That's our
[2601.52 --> 2601.94]  groans.
[2603.42 --> 2604.16]  It keeps
[2604.16 --> 2604.50]  going.
[2605.70 --> 2606.36]  And he
[2606.36 --> 2607.08]  who searches
[2607.08 --> 2608.22]  our hearts
[2608.22 --> 2609.32]  knows the
[2609.32 --> 2609.68]  mind of
[2609.68 --> 2610.20]  the spirit
[2610.20 --> 2611.28]  because the
[2611.28 --> 2611.56]  spirit
[2611.56 --> 2612.16]  intercedes
[2612.16 --> 2612.62]  for God's
[2612.62 --> 2613.16]  people in
[2613.16 --> 2614.04]  accordance with
[2614.04 --> 2614.96]  the will
[2614.96 --> 2615.48]  of God.
[2616.68 --> 2617.32]  When we
[2617.32 --> 2618.04]  are in a
[2618.04 --> 2618.48]  spiritual
[2618.48 --> 2618.96]  wrestling
[2618.96 --> 2619.50]  match,
[2619.90 --> 2620.68]  when the
[2620.68 --> 2621.24]  devil has
[2621.24 --> 2621.76]  us pinned
[2621.76 --> 2622.42]  down by
[2622.42 --> 2623.02]  our sin,
[2623.40 --> 2624.26]  or when
[2624.26 --> 2625.02]  we are
[2625.02 --> 2625.28]  just
[2625.28 --> 2626.00]  overwhelmed
[2626.00 --> 2626.50]  with the
[2626.50 --> 2627.24]  trials of
[2627.24 --> 2627.64]  life,
[2628.12 --> 2629.18]  sometimes all
[2629.18 --> 2629.58]  we can
[2629.58 --> 2630.56]  get out
[2630.56 --> 2631.68]  is a
[2631.68 --> 2632.20]  groan.
[2633.72 --> 2634.18]  Sometimes
[2634.18 --> 2634.76]  we just
[2634.76 --> 2635.90]  don't have
[2635.90 --> 2637.14]  the words.
[2638.58 --> 2639.22]  But Paul
[2639.22 --> 2640.08]  says here
[2640.08 --> 2640.60]  that God
[2640.60 --> 2641.64]  knows our
[2641.64 --> 2642.32]  hearts.
[2643.48 --> 2644.08]  He knows
[2644.08 --> 2644.68]  our hearts.
[2645.34 --> 2645.96]  And the
[2645.96 --> 2646.62]  Holy Spirit
[2646.62 --> 2648.06]  himself
[2648.06 --> 2649.18]  intercedes
[2649.18 --> 2649.88]  for us.
[2650.42 --> 2650.70]  He can
[2650.70 --> 2651.30]  take our
[2651.30 --> 2651.80]  wordless
[2651.80 --> 2652.36]  groans,
[2652.88 --> 2653.52]  he knows
[2653.52 --> 2654.06]  our hearts,
[2654.10 --> 2654.58]  and he knows
[2654.58 --> 2655.02]  the will of
[2655.02 --> 2655.26]  God,
[2655.34 --> 2655.88]  and he can
[2655.88 --> 2656.74]  lift it up
[2656.74 --> 2657.88]  to God's
[2657.88 --> 2658.34]  presence.
[2658.94 --> 2659.54]  The spirit
[2659.54 --> 2660.44]  joins us
[2660.44 --> 2661.10]  as we pray
[2661.10 --> 2662.32]  so that we
[2662.32 --> 2662.72]  can pray
[2662.72 --> 2663.16]  what God
[2663.16 --> 2664.44]  desires in
[2664.44 --> 2665.08]  our lives
[2665.08 --> 2665.44]  and in the
[2665.44 --> 2665.72]  world.
[2667.08 --> 2667.68]  And there's
[2667.68 --> 2668.16]  another thing
[2668.16 --> 2668.68]  that happens
[2668.68 --> 2668.98]  when we
[2668.98 --> 2669.38]  pray in
[2669.38 --> 2669.82]  the spirit
[2669.82 --> 2671.56]  is that
[2671.56 --> 2672.52]  God will
[2672.52 --> 2673.18]  often
[2673.18 --> 2674.42]  settle
[2674.42 --> 2674.96]  certain
[2674.96 --> 2676.00]  things in
[2676.00 --> 2676.80]  our hearts
[2676.80 --> 2677.12]  to pray
[2677.12 --> 2677.36]  for.
[2678.56 --> 2679.24]  When we're
[2679.24 --> 2679.82]  praying in
[2679.82 --> 2680.44]  the spirit,
[2681.02 --> 2681.54]  God will
[2681.54 --> 2682.58]  convict us,
[2683.54 --> 2684.06]  he will put
[2684.06 --> 2684.64]  on our
[2684.64 --> 2685.26]  hearts
[2685.26 --> 2686.72]  what to
[2686.72 --> 2687.22]  pray for.
[2687.22 --> 2689.36]  And so
[2689.36 --> 2689.64]  if you're
[2689.64 --> 2690.12]  praying for
[2690.12 --> 2690.66]  something,
[2691.66 --> 2693.18]  and you're
[2693.18 --> 2693.60]  doing it
[2693.60 --> 2694.16]  in the
[2694.16 --> 2694.74]  spirit,
[2695.02 --> 2695.26]  and you're
[2695.26 --> 2695.60]  doing it
[2695.60 --> 2696.26]  in faith,
[2696.80 --> 2697.22]  then that's
[2697.22 --> 2697.88]  likely what
[2697.88 --> 2698.34]  God wants
[2698.34 --> 2698.54]  you to
[2698.54 --> 2698.96]  pray for.
[2699.96 --> 2700.52]  If you
[2700.52 --> 2701.02]  have something
[2701.02 --> 2701.38]  in your
[2701.38 --> 2702.04]  heart that
[2702.04 --> 2702.76]  you're not
[2702.76 --> 2703.72]  willing to
[2703.72 --> 2704.14]  take before
[2704.14 --> 2704.54]  the Lord
[2704.54 --> 2704.96]  and really
[2704.96 --> 2705.68]  lay bare
[2705.68 --> 2706.38]  before God
[2706.38 --> 2707.06]  in humility,
[2707.52 --> 2708.04]  maybe that's
[2708.04 --> 2709.12]  not what
[2709.12 --> 2710.48]  God's will
[2710.48 --> 2710.76]  is.
[2712.20 --> 2713.04]  So George
[2713.04 --> 2713.74]  Mueller is
[2713.74 --> 2715.20]  well known
[2715.20 --> 2715.56]  for his
[2715.56 --> 2715.96]  care of
[2715.96 --> 2716.62]  orphans in
[2716.62 --> 2716.94]  England.
[2717.94 --> 2718.40]  He cared
[2718.40 --> 2718.82]  for something
[2718.82 --> 2719.36]  like over
[2719.36 --> 2720.30]  10,000
[2720.30 --> 2721.68]  orphans in
[2721.68 --> 2722.20]  his life.
[2723.34 --> 2724.60]  And he
[2724.60 --> 2724.98]  had two
[2724.98 --> 2726.02]  friends whose
[2726.02 --> 2727.02]  salvation he
[2727.02 --> 2727.84]  prayed for
[2727.84 --> 2729.20]  for 50
[2729.20 --> 2729.70]  years.
[2730.96 --> 2731.48]  And when
[2731.48 --> 2732.14]  someone asked
[2732.14 --> 2733.04]  him, does
[2733.04 --> 2733.54]  he really
[2733.54 --> 2734.40]  believe that
[2734.40 --> 2734.90]  those two
[2734.90 --> 2735.44]  friends of
[2735.44 --> 2736.06]  his would
[2736.06 --> 2736.96]  eventually come
[2736.96 --> 2737.50]  to faith and
[2737.50 --> 2738.04]  be converted,
[2738.90 --> 2739.44]  George Mueller
[2739.44 --> 2740.48]  replied, do
[2740.48 --> 2741.44]  you think God
[2741.44 --> 2742.08]  would have kept
[2742.08 --> 2743.06]  me praying all
[2743.06 --> 2743.80]  of these years
[2743.80 --> 2745.08]  if he did not
[2745.08 --> 2745.76]  intend to save
[2745.76 --> 2745.94]  them?
[2745.94 --> 2748.20]  And of
[2748.20 --> 2749.52]  course, both
[2749.52 --> 2749.92]  men were
[2749.92 --> 2750.26]  converted,
[2750.46 --> 2750.62]  right?
[2751.24 --> 2752.36]  One right
[2752.36 --> 2753.82]  before Mueller's
[2753.82 --> 2754.66]  death and one
[2754.66 --> 2755.80]  right after.
[2756.62 --> 2757.18]  But it's this
[2757.18 --> 2758.18]  idea that God
[2758.18 --> 2758.90]  has put it on
[2758.90 --> 2759.66]  our hearts to
[2759.66 --> 2759.94]  pray for
[2759.94 --> 2760.30]  something.
[2760.66 --> 2761.20]  And we
[2761.20 --> 2761.50]  need to
[2761.50 --> 2762.26]  persevere in
[2762.26 --> 2762.54]  prayer.
[2763.38 --> 2763.78]  But God
[2763.78 --> 2764.38]  will accomplish
[2764.38 --> 2765.68]  his will
[2765.68 --> 2766.60]  through our
[2766.60 --> 2766.96]  prayers.
[2767.12 --> 2767.82]  Spurgeon said
[2767.82 --> 2768.76]  that our
[2768.76 --> 2769.32]  prayers are
[2769.32 --> 2770.02]  God's will
[2770.02 --> 2770.54]  in another
[2770.54 --> 2771.02]  form.
[2771.02 --> 2774.12]  So praying
[2774.12 --> 2774.42]  in the
[2774.42 --> 2775.08]  Spirit means
[2775.08 --> 2775.40]  that the
[2775.40 --> 2776.14]  Spirit moves
[2776.14 --> 2776.48]  us to
[2776.48 --> 2776.70]  pray.
[2777.42 --> 2777.96]  The Spirit
[2777.96 --> 2779.18]  empowers us
[2779.18 --> 2779.80]  to pray and
[2779.80 --> 2780.20]  the Spirit
[2780.20 --> 2781.38]  helps us
[2781.38 --> 2782.30]  to pray.
[2783.46 --> 2784.16]  Now verse
[2784.16 --> 2785.36]  18 continues.
[2786.28 --> 2787.10]  He says,
[2787.22 --> 2787.60]  and pray in
[2787.60 --> 2788.08]  the Spirit
[2788.08 --> 2789.50]  on all
[2789.50 --> 2790.00]  occasions
[2790.00 --> 2790.98]  with all
[2790.98 --> 2791.64]  kinds of
[2791.64 --> 2792.12]  prayers and
[2792.12 --> 2792.64]  requests.
[2793.24 --> 2793.60]  With this
[2793.60 --> 2794.02]  in mind,
[2794.10 --> 2794.80]  be alert and
[2794.80 --> 2795.52]  always keep
[2795.52 --> 2795.94]  on praying
[2795.94 --> 2796.98]  for all
[2796.98 --> 2797.94]  the Lord's
[2797.94 --> 2798.56]  people.
[2798.56 --> 2799.86]  So notice
[2799.86 --> 2800.32]  how many
[2800.32 --> 2801.34]  times the
[2801.34 --> 2802.02]  word all
[2802.02 --> 2802.46]  is used
[2802.46 --> 2802.68]  in this
[2802.68 --> 2803.16]  one verse.
[2804.34 --> 2804.68]  All
[2804.68 --> 2805.24]  occasions.
[2806.60 --> 2807.40]  All kinds
[2807.40 --> 2807.88]  of prayers
[2807.88 --> 2808.66]  and requests.
[2808.90 --> 2809.44]  Adoration,
[2809.68 --> 2810.16]  confession,
[2810.62 --> 2811.12]  thanksgiving,
[2811.34 --> 2812.12]  supplication.
[2813.18 --> 2814.04]  Always keep
[2814.04 --> 2814.62]  on praying.
[2814.82 --> 2815.46]  Persevere in
[2815.46 --> 2816.28]  prayer and
[2816.28 --> 2817.26]  pray for all
[2817.26 --> 2818.00]  of the
[2818.00 --> 2818.28]  Lord's
[2818.28 --> 2818.60]  people.
[2818.92 --> 2819.26]  In the
[2819.26 --> 2819.68]  Pilgrim's
[2819.68 --> 2820.28]  Progress,
[2821.20 --> 2821.78]  John Bunyan
[2821.78 --> 2822.54]  called this
[2822.54 --> 2823.84]  weapon all
[2823.84 --> 2825.40]  prayer from
[2825.40 --> 2826.06]  this passage.
[2827.68 --> 2827.84]  You know,
[2827.84 --> 2828.16]  and there
[2828.16 --> 2828.80]  are many
[2828.80 --> 2829.40]  things that
[2829.40 --> 2829.76]  are worth
[2829.76 --> 2830.32]  praying for.
[2830.42 --> 2830.62]  We have
[2830.62 --> 2831.00]  lots of
[2831.00 --> 2831.34]  things to
[2831.34 --> 2831.74]  pray for.
[2832.52 --> 2833.10]  But all
[2833.10 --> 2833.82]  the Lord's
[2833.82 --> 2834.26]  people,
[2835.64 --> 2836.38]  our brothers
[2836.38 --> 2837.12]  and sisters
[2837.12 --> 2837.76]  in the
[2837.76 --> 2838.16]  faith,
[2838.74 --> 2839.22]  are to
[2839.22 --> 2839.88]  have a
[2839.88 --> 2840.90]  large part
[2840.90 --> 2841.74]  of our
[2841.74 --> 2842.16]  prayers.
[2843.16 --> 2844.48]  If someone's
[2844.48 --> 2845.40]  marriage is
[2845.40 --> 2845.94]  struggling,
[2846.88 --> 2847.80]  you pray
[2847.80 --> 2848.36]  with your
[2848.36 --> 2848.84]  brother and
[2848.84 --> 2849.08]  sister.
[2849.22 --> 2849.62]  You cry
[2849.62 --> 2849.96]  out to
[2849.96 --> 2851.18]  God for
[2851.18 --> 2852.06]  healing and
[2852.06 --> 2852.84]  forgiveness and
[2852.84 --> 2853.94]  love just
[2853.94 --> 2855.02]  as if it
[2855.02 --> 2856.82]  were your
[2856.82 --> 2858.06]  marriage.
[2859.22 --> 2860.24]  If someone's
[2860.24 --> 2860.82]  child is
[2860.82 --> 2861.48]  walking away
[2861.48 --> 2861.82]  from the
[2861.82 --> 2862.54]  Lord, it's
[2862.54 --> 2863.12]  not just
[2863.12 --> 2863.88]  their child,
[2864.06 --> 2864.78]  it is your
[2864.78 --> 2865.26]  child.
[2866.00 --> 2866.42]  And you
[2866.42 --> 2867.08]  pray that the
[2867.08 --> 2867.50]  Lord would
[2867.50 --> 2868.04]  bring that
[2868.04 --> 2868.68]  child back.
[2869.76 --> 2870.38]  If someone
[2870.38 --> 2871.56]  is sick, you
[2871.56 --> 2872.36]  pray as if
[2872.36 --> 2873.48]  you were the
[2873.48 --> 2874.32]  one needing
[2874.32 --> 2874.76]  healing.
[2876.94 --> 2877.56]  There's this
[2877.56 --> 2878.20]  old movie
[2878.20 --> 2879.28]  called
[2879.28 --> 2880.02]  Spartacus.
[2880.18 --> 2881.10]  I know, I've
[2881.10 --> 2881.92]  seen it a long
[2881.92 --> 2882.46]  time ago, but
[2882.46 --> 2882.90]  does everyone
[2882.90 --> 2883.34]  know the movie
[2883.34 --> 2883.92]  Spartacus?
[2883.92 --> 2884.36]  Spartacus?
[2884.88 --> 2885.38]  Only one,
[2885.46 --> 2885.64]  Johnny?
[2886.18 --> 2886.58]  Okay, a
[2886.58 --> 2886.74]  couple.
[2887.18 --> 2887.34]  Yeah.
[2888.02 --> 2888.60]  So it
[2888.60 --> 2889.22]  takes place in
[2889.22 --> 2890.00]  about 72
[2890.00 --> 2892.04]  BC in the
[2892.04 --> 2892.66]  Roman Empire.
[2892.84 --> 2893.48]  Spartacus, he
[2893.48 --> 2894.40]  was a gladiator
[2894.40 --> 2896.00]  and he led a
[2896.00 --> 2896.82]  slave rebellion.
[2898.26 --> 2898.82]  And a
[2898.82 --> 2899.90]  thousand slaves
[2899.90 --> 2900.56]  joined him.
[2901.14 --> 2902.04]  But finally, the
[2902.04 --> 2902.78]  power of the
[2902.78 --> 2903.44]  Roman government
[2903.44 --> 2904.28]  suppresses the
[2904.28 --> 2905.50]  rebellion and
[2905.50 --> 2907.02]  they gather up
[2907.02 --> 2907.74]  all the slaves.
[2907.96 --> 2908.16]  And then
[2908.16 --> 2909.30]  Crassus, the
[2909.30 --> 2909.88]  Roman senator,
[2910.02 --> 2911.20]  comes out and
[2911.20 --> 2911.88]  he doesn't know
[2911.88 --> 2912.88]  what Spartacus
[2912.88 --> 2913.46]  looks like.
[2913.86 --> 2914.14]  There are
[2914.14 --> 2914.74]  thousands of
[2914.74 --> 2916.04]  slaves there and
[2916.04 --> 2916.50]  so he offers
[2916.50 --> 2917.02]  them a deal.
[2917.18 --> 2917.88]  He says, give
[2917.88 --> 2919.16]  me Spartacus and
[2919.16 --> 2920.18]  I'll spare the
[2920.18 --> 2920.70]  rest of you.
[2921.54 --> 2922.46]  Otherwise, you'll
[2922.46 --> 2923.30]  all be crucified.
[2925.60 --> 2926.94]  Spartacus stands
[2926.94 --> 2927.40]  there and he
[2927.40 --> 2928.24]  knows if he gives
[2928.24 --> 2929.04]  himself up, he
[2929.04 --> 2929.82]  will be able to
[2929.82 --> 2931.00]  save his
[2931.00 --> 2931.42]  comrades.
[2932.48 --> 2933.28]  So he steps
[2933.28 --> 2934.84]  forward and he
[2934.84 --> 2937.58]  says, I am
[2937.58 --> 2938.22]  Spartacus.
[2939.12 --> 2940.04]  And then behind
[2940.04 --> 2940.84]  him what happens?
[2940.84 --> 2942.60]  another slave
[2942.60 --> 2943.22]  steps forward.
[2943.84 --> 2945.08]  I am Spartacus.
[2945.54 --> 2947.08]  And another, I
[2947.08 --> 2947.84]  am Spartacus.
[2948.12 --> 2948.72]  I am Spartacus.
[2948.80 --> 2950.00]  And they're all
[2950.00 --> 2950.94]  saying this.
[2952.14 --> 2952.86]  And that's the
[2952.86 --> 2953.32]  way it is in
[2953.32 --> 2953.98]  God's church.
[2954.92 --> 2955.98]  If a brother or
[2955.98 --> 2957.02]  sister has
[2957.02 --> 2958.64]  trouble, if they
[2958.64 --> 2959.64]  have problems,
[2960.02 --> 2960.84]  everyone steps
[2960.84 --> 2961.38]  forward and
[2961.38 --> 2962.90]  says, it is
[2962.90 --> 2963.32]  mine.
[2964.10 --> 2965.28]  I will bear it
[2965.28 --> 2965.68]  with them.
[2966.22 --> 2967.74]  I will pray
[2967.74 --> 2969.02]  for this.
[2969.98 --> 2970.42]  Pray for all
[2970.42 --> 2970.82]  the saints.
[2970.90 --> 2971.56]  And as we pray
[2971.56 --> 2972.86]  on all occasions,
[2972.86 --> 2974.66]  with all kinds of
[2974.66 --> 2975.66]  prayers for all the
[2975.66 --> 2976.24]  Lord's people,
[2977.36 --> 2978.14]  something happens.
[2978.96 --> 2979.92]  Maybe not
[2979.92 --> 2980.90]  immediately,
[2981.76 --> 2982.72]  maybe not always
[2982.72 --> 2983.40]  in ways that are
[2983.40 --> 2984.30]  visible to our
[2984.30 --> 2985.58]  eyes, but
[2985.58 --> 2986.98]  something always
[2986.98 --> 2988.52]  happens when we
[2988.52 --> 2989.16]  pray in the
[2989.16 --> 2989.44]  Spirit.
[2990.20 --> 2991.20]  Because when we
[2991.20 --> 2991.90]  pray, when we
[2991.90 --> 2993.30]  sound the horn of
[2993.30 --> 2995.12]  prayer, we go
[2995.12 --> 2996.82]  over the heads of
[2996.82 --> 2997.32]  the spiritual
[2997.32 --> 2998.60]  forces of
[2998.60 --> 2999.80]  evil over the
[2999.80 --> 3000.32]  heads of the
[3000.32 --> 3001.16]  devil, and we
[3001.16 --> 3001.70]  lift up our
[3001.70 --> 3002.40]  prayers to the
[3002.40 --> 3003.06]  sovereign Lord,
[3003.18 --> 3003.80]  who is the
[3003.80 --> 3005.46]  head over all
[3005.46 --> 3005.88]  things.
[3007.50 --> 3008.16]  And just as
[3008.16 --> 3009.50]  soldiers need to
[3009.50 --> 3010.42]  be in contact
[3010.42 --> 3010.86]  with their
[3010.86 --> 3011.90]  commander, and
[3011.90 --> 3012.62]  just as husbands
[3012.62 --> 3013.92]  and wives need
[3013.92 --> 3015.44]  to relate to
[3015.44 --> 3016.86]  one another, so
[3016.86 --> 3018.46]  we must pray to
[3018.46 --> 3019.72]  our Lord, who is
[3019.72 --> 3020.58]  both the
[3020.58 --> 3022.46]  commander of our
[3022.46 --> 3024.04]  lives and the
[3024.04 --> 3025.02]  lover of our
[3025.02 --> 3025.34]  souls.
[3026.82 --> 3027.60]  So let's move
[3027.60 --> 3027.96]  towards a
[3027.96 --> 3028.36]  conclusion.
[3030.12 --> 3031.50]  The calling of
[3031.50 --> 3033.00]  this passage is
[3033.00 --> 3033.94]  to stand strong
[3033.94 --> 3034.44]  in the Lord.
[3035.44 --> 3036.28]  How do we do
[3036.28 --> 3036.50]  that?
[3037.76 --> 3039.02]  Put on the
[3039.02 --> 3040.48]  full armor of
[3040.48 --> 3041.92]  God so that
[3041.92 --> 3042.86]  you can take
[3042.86 --> 3043.96]  your stand against
[3043.96 --> 3044.54]  the devil's
[3044.54 --> 3044.94]  schemes.
[3045.96 --> 3047.06]  Five defensive
[3047.06 --> 3047.78]  pieces of the
[3047.78 --> 3048.88]  armor, the
[3048.88 --> 3049.78]  belt of truth,
[3050.50 --> 3051.30]  the breastplate of
[3051.30 --> 3052.40]  righteousness, the
[3052.40 --> 3053.48]  shoes of peace, the
[3053.48 --> 3054.80]  shield of faith, and
[3054.80 --> 3055.32]  the helmet of
[3055.32 --> 3055.82]  salvation.
[3056.82 --> 3057.90]  And two offensive
[3057.90 --> 3058.72]  pieces of the
[3058.72 --> 3060.06]  armor, the sword
[3060.06 --> 3060.86]  of the Spirit, which
[3060.86 --> 3061.92]  is the word of
[3061.92 --> 3063.10]  God in the
[3063.10 --> 3064.38]  world, and
[3064.38 --> 3065.42]  praying in the
[3065.42 --> 3066.40]  Spirit, which is
[3066.40 --> 3067.76]  interceding for the
[3067.76 --> 3069.18]  world before the
[3069.18 --> 3070.64]  throne of King
[3070.64 --> 3071.10]  Jesus.
[3073.68 --> 3075.24]  On the night of
[3075.24 --> 3076.84]  the first Lord's
[3076.84 --> 3078.16]  Supper, when
[3078.16 --> 3079.78]  everyone was making
[3079.78 --> 3080.76]  their promises to
[3080.76 --> 3081.56]  Jesus, they were
[3081.56 --> 3082.84]  saying, even if
[3082.84 --> 3083.96]  everyone abandons
[3083.96 --> 3084.96]  you, I will not
[3084.96 --> 3085.64]  abandon you.
[3086.36 --> 3087.20]  And then Peter,
[3087.32 --> 3088.10]  Simon Peter, went
[3088.10 --> 3089.48]  so far as to
[3089.48 --> 3090.80]  boldly claim, there
[3090.80 --> 3092.24]  is no way I will
[3092.24 --> 3093.92]  ever leave you,
[3094.04 --> 3094.20]  Lord.
[3095.74 --> 3096.50]  And then in Luke
[3096.50 --> 3098.58]  chapter 22, we
[3098.58 --> 3099.80]  learn that Jesus
[3099.80 --> 3101.68]  pulls Simon Peter
[3101.68 --> 3103.10]  aside, and he
[3103.10 --> 3104.22]  says, Simon,
[3104.56 --> 3107.44]  Simon, Satan has
[3107.44 --> 3109.28]  asked to sift all
[3109.28 --> 3110.66]  of you as
[3110.66 --> 3111.00]  wheat.
[3112.68 --> 3113.50]  And he's going
[3113.50 --> 3113.92]  to win a
[3113.92 --> 3114.20]  battle.
[3116.06 --> 3117.32]  In fact, he is
[3117.32 --> 3118.18]  going to win
[3118.18 --> 3119.44]  three battles.
[3121.02 --> 3122.14]  Peter is going to
[3122.14 --> 3123.12]  deny Jesus three
[3123.12 --> 3125.00]  times, but Jesus
[3125.00 --> 3126.68]  continues, and he
[3126.68 --> 3132.22]  says, but I have
[3132.22 --> 3133.70]  prayed for you,
[3133.70 --> 3135.70]  Simon, that your
[3135.70 --> 3137.42]  faith may not
[3137.42 --> 3137.72]  fail.
[3139.64 --> 3140.14]  And friends,
[3140.36 --> 3141.36]  Satan has asked
[3141.36 --> 3142.46]  to sift all of
[3142.46 --> 3143.18]  us like wheat.
[3144.40 --> 3144.64]  Right?
[3144.74 --> 3146.08]  And all of us
[3146.08 --> 3147.20]  one day will
[3147.20 --> 3147.50]  fail.
[3148.82 --> 3149.18]  There will be
[3149.18 --> 3149.94]  many battles
[3149.94 --> 3151.20]  won, there
[3151.20 --> 3151.68]  will be some
[3151.68 --> 3152.46]  battles lost.
[3153.18 --> 3154.14]  Sometimes because
[3154.14 --> 3155.80]  of pride, self
[3155.80 --> 3156.80]  sufficiency, we
[3156.80 --> 3158.28]  fail to blow the
[3158.28 --> 3159.36]  horn of prayer.
[3159.94 --> 3160.70]  We don't call
[3160.70 --> 3162.22]  out to God to
[3162.22 --> 3162.84]  help us.
[3163.70 --> 3165.78]  other times,
[3166.02 --> 3166.86]  because of fear,
[3167.52 --> 3168.76]  we fail to speak
[3168.76 --> 3169.54]  God's word.
[3171.06 --> 3173.68]  But, you have
[3173.68 --> 3174.62]  one, even
[3174.62 --> 3176.26]  now, in the
[3176.26 --> 3177.10]  heavenly realms,
[3177.86 --> 3178.56]  praying for you.
[3179.48 --> 3180.84]  The Lord Jesus
[3180.84 --> 3181.34]  Christ.
[3182.10 --> 3182.88]  And ultimately,
[3183.34 --> 3184.50]  that is the
[3184.50 --> 3185.62]  power that you
[3185.62 --> 3187.38]  have to stand
[3187.38 --> 3188.82]  in the Lord.
[3189.20 --> 3190.28]  To stand against
[3190.28 --> 3190.90]  the schemes of
[3190.90 --> 3191.86]  the devil, because
[3191.86 --> 3192.98]  you are clothed
[3192.98 --> 3194.00]  clothed with the
[3194.00 --> 3194.58]  righteousness of
[3194.58 --> 3194.92]  Christ.
[3195.32 --> 3196.34]  You have put on
[3196.34 --> 3197.64]  the salvation of
[3197.64 --> 3198.04]  Christ.
[3198.80 --> 3199.58]  You have been
[3199.58 --> 3200.64]  given the faith
[3200.64 --> 3201.40]  to trust in
[3201.40 --> 3201.74]  Christ.
[3201.96 --> 3202.54]  You have the
[3202.54 --> 3203.08]  sword of the
[3203.08 --> 3203.36]  Spirit.
[3203.74 --> 3204.16]  And you have
[3204.16 --> 3205.50]  prayer, and not
[3205.50 --> 3207.30]  only do you have
[3207.30 --> 3208.26]  this ability to
[3208.26 --> 3209.34]  pray to God, but
[3209.34 --> 3210.34]  Jesus, who died
[3210.34 --> 3210.98]  for you and loves
[3210.98 --> 3212.24]  you, is praying
[3212.24 --> 3212.64]  for you.
[3213.92 --> 3214.60]  Let's pray.
[3214.60 --> 3220.28]  Lord, we thank
[3220.28 --> 3222.06]  you for this
[3222.06 --> 3223.18]  full armor of
[3223.18 --> 3223.50]  God.
[3224.22 --> 3225.02]  Lord, you know
[3225.02 --> 3225.80]  each and every
[3225.80 --> 3227.54]  piece that we
[3227.54 --> 3227.90]  need.
[3229.02 --> 3229.80]  Lord, we pray
[3229.80 --> 3230.18]  that you would
[3230.18 --> 3231.02]  help us to take
[3231.02 --> 3231.78]  each one of
[3231.78 --> 3232.58]  these defensive,
[3232.84 --> 3234.02]  offensive pieces
[3234.02 --> 3234.68]  of this armor,
[3235.02 --> 3235.56]  that we might
[3235.56 --> 3236.60]  stand against the
[3236.60 --> 3237.26]  devil's schemes.
[3237.38 --> 3237.78]  You have not
[3237.78 --> 3239.84]  left us vulnerable,
[3240.64 --> 3241.68]  but Lord, you have
[3241.68 --> 3242.58]  given strength to
[3242.58 --> 3243.76]  your people, that
[3243.76 --> 3244.60]  we might stand
[3244.60 --> 3245.72]  not in our own
[3245.72 --> 3246.36]  strength, but in
[3246.36 --> 3247.04]  your strength.
[3247.70 --> 3248.54]  Lord, would you
[3248.54 --> 3250.34]  make us people of
[3250.34 --> 3252.08]  word and prayer,
[3252.74 --> 3253.60]  that through
[3253.60 --> 3254.74]  speaking your word
[3254.74 --> 3256.92]  and praying that
[3256.92 --> 3257.80]  you would accomplish
[3257.80 --> 3258.94]  many things in
[3258.94 --> 3259.96]  this world, that
[3259.96 --> 3260.72]  your kingdom would
[3260.72 --> 3262.82]  come near, and
[3262.82 --> 3263.34]  that you would
[3263.34 --> 3264.72]  reign as
[3264.72 --> 3265.32]  sovereign Lord
[3265.32 --> 3266.14]  over all things.
[3266.90 --> 3267.62]  We pray in
[3267.62 --> 3268.20]  Jesus' name.
[3268.84 --> 3269.12]  Amen.
[3271.26 --> 3271.92]  All right.
[3271.92 --> 3273.66]  So let's stand.
[3273.78 --> 3274.84]  Let's sing our
[3274.84 --> 3276.04]  song of response.
[3276.68 --> 3278.26]  Love divine, all
[3278.26 --> 3279.36]  loves excelling.
[3279.36 --> 3280.36]  Amen.
[3309.36 --> 3311.36]  Amen.
[3339.36 --> 3341.36]  Amen.
[3369.36 --> 3371.36]  Amen.
[3399.36 --> 3401.36]  Amen.
[3429.36 --> 3431.36]  Amen.
[3459.36 --> 3461.36]  Amen.
[3489.36 --> 3496.60]  And at this time, excuse me, we're going to be taking the offering, and the offering today is for the Ministry of Seafarers Literature Fund.
[3496.60 --> 3507.36]  Now, the Ministry of Seafarers is a ministry that all the churches of Christian reform churches in British Columbia coveted to support through our ministry classical shares.
[3507.36 --> 3516.36]  But the literature fund is a separate fund for literature and things that are given to seafarers, and especially Bibles,
[3516.36 --> 3520.26]  which are very much appreciated in many, many different languages.
[3520.76 --> 3523.90]  So could I ask the deacons to come forward for this offering?
[3526.12 --> 3530.82]  While the offering is being received, we'll also sing together, Count Your Many Blessings.
[3531.26 --> 3533.46]  It's going to be sung a little bit differently today.
[3533.68 --> 3536.96]  Harry and I will sing verse 1, and if you could join on the chorus.
[3537.56 --> 3540.78]  And we'll also sing verse 2, if you'll join on the chorus.
[3541.28 --> 3543.26]  The words will not be up there.
[3543.70 --> 3544.86]  We're going to go off memory.
[3544.86 --> 3548.22]  So a little memory test for everyone.
[3563.22 --> 3568.86]  When upon life's pillows you are tempest-tossed,
[3568.86 --> 3574.86]  When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
[3576.22 --> 3580.86]  Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
[3581.66 --> 3586.86]  And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.
[3586.86 --> 3594.14]  Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
[3594.14 --> 3600.38]  Count your blessings, see what God has done.
[3600.38 --> 3607.50]  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
[3607.50 --> 3614.50]  Count your many blessings, see what God has done.
[3615.86 --> 3621.86]  Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
[3621.86 --> 3627.96]  Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
[3627.96 --> 3633.96]  Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
[3633.96 --> 3640.22]  And you will be singing as the days go by.
[3640.22 --> 3646.22]  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
[3646.22 --> 3653.22]  Count your blessings, see what God has done.
[3653.22 --> 3660.22]  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
[3660.22 --> 3662.22]  Count your many blessings, name them by one,
[3662.22 --> 3667.22]  Count your many blessings, see what God has done.
[3667.22 --> 3676.22]  Thank you, Vental brothers.
[3676.22 --> 3681.22]  Thank you, Vental brothers.
[3681.22 --> 3685.22]  At this time we're going to lead you in a community prayer.
[3685.22 --> 3689.22]  The opening line of my prayer is from Psalm 5.
[3689.22 --> 3692.22]  Let us pray.
[3692.22 --> 3694.22]  We thank you, our Lord.
[3694.22 --> 3696.22]  You hear our prayer in the morning.
[3696.22 --> 3701.22]  At sunrise we offer our prayers and await your answer.
[3701.22 --> 3704.22]  Gracious God, you created the world in beauty.
[3704.22 --> 3710.22]  You created us in your image and yet more wonderfully restored us in Christ.
[3710.22 --> 3713.22]  We are thankful for the communities we live in,
[3713.22 --> 3716.22]  For services which we sometimes take for granted.
[3716.22 --> 3722.22]  For clean water, for public servants such as police, doctors, judges, nurses,
[3722.22 --> 3727.22]  Firefighters, military personnel, and paramedics among others.
[3727.22 --> 3731.22]  May we be mindful of all these services we have.
[3731.22 --> 3737.22]  Bless all the workers who keep our economy going and providing us with goods and services.
[3737.22 --> 3742.22]  We pray for those who work in agriculture, including those farmers in our own church,
[3742.22 --> 3746.22]  Who provide us with the daily necessities of life.
[3746.22 --> 3753.22]  We are thankful for your provision in this world and may we be good stewards of your creation.
[3753.22 --> 3763.22]  We pray for our nation, for our Prime Minister, our new Premier Eby, and the mayors of the communities we represent, Delta and Richmond.
[3763.22 --> 3768.22]  Give them a sense of justice and provide them with wisdom for leadership.
[3768.22 --> 3774.22]  We pray for our broken world, for Christians around this world.
[3774.22 --> 3781.22]  We want to especially remember persecuted Christians in the country of Iran, which is in turmoil at present.
[3781.22 --> 3783.22]  Protect your church there.
[3783.22 --> 3793.22]  We pray for a change of heart in the leadership of Iran to give more freedom to Christian believers and to all its citizens.
[3793.22 --> 3798.22]  We also pray for believers in Ethiopia and Nigeria.
[3798.22 --> 3803.22]  Bless your church in these countries where there is so much unrest.
[3803.22 --> 3807.22]  Very much in our hearts is the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
[3807.22 --> 3812.22]  We see the images in the media and our hearts go out to all those who are uprooted.
[3812.22 --> 3816.22]  Millions have fled their homes and have become refugees.
[3816.22 --> 3821.22]  We pray for those providing short and long-term aid for those in need.
[3821.22 --> 3827.22]  Work in the hearts of those who are perpetrating this violence and bring it to an end.
[3827.22 --> 3833.22]  Bless world leaders as they grapple with these seemingly insurmountable conflicts.
[3833.22 --> 3839.22]  We pray for nations as we see a rise in authoritarian power in many countries.
[3839.22 --> 3842.22]  We pray for our church.
[3842.22 --> 3849.22]  Bless our ministry leaders, Pastor Jason and Associate Pastor Nancy and our church council.
[3849.22 --> 3853.22]  Also the many volunteers who are leading our many programs.
[3853.22 --> 3858.22]  Continue to bless the work of Pastor Nancy and the Chinese ministry.
[3858.22 --> 3865.22]  May we continue to grow together so that we can become one body, getting to know each other better.
[3865.22 --> 3872.22]  And provide for the Chinese ministry in Nancy's absence while she recovers from her surgery.
[3872.22 --> 3878.22]  We pray for the ministries of our Christian Reformed denomination and our classes.
[3878.22 --> 3883.22]  We pray in particular this morning for the ministry to seafarers.
[3883.22 --> 3887.22]  Bless Gary and the other chaplains as they minister to the seafarers.
[3887.22 --> 3894.22]  The past few years have been very difficult for seafarers having to be away from home with difficult working conditions.
[3894.22 --> 3896.22]  For up to a year at a time.
[3896.22 --> 3904.22]  We are thankful for this ministry that meets the physical and spiritual needs of seafarers.
[3904.22 --> 3908.22]  We want to remember and bring before you the needs of our congregation.
[3908.22 --> 3911.22]  For those seniors living in care homes.
[3911.22 --> 3919.22]  We pray especially for Pastor Nancy this morning who is facing very serious surgery this coming week for her cancer.
[3919.22 --> 3925.22]  We pray you will protect her and guide the doctors who perform this surgery.
[3925.22 --> 3930.22]  Thank you for the sense of peace you have given to Pastor Nancy.
[3930.22 --> 3937.22]  We also pray for Jordan Van Tull as he continues his chemotherapy treatments for his cancer.
[3937.22 --> 3941.22]  Uphold Jordan and Vanessa and their young family during this time.
[3941.22 --> 3953.22]  Also those who are in need of your healing we pray for Grace Koistra, for Pat Bauman, for Fou, for Quinn and Grace Burtnick.
[3953.22 --> 3959.22]  Lord you know what each of these persons is needs and we pray for their healing.
[3959.22 --> 3973.22]  Remember those in our midst who may be struggling with unseen hurts like mental illness or depression, addictions and broken relationships in family and marriages.
[3973.22 --> 3981.22]  Gracious God accept all these prayers in Jesus name and give us now the strength to wait patiently for your answer.
[3981.22 --> 3987.22]  And to live faithfully in response to your call through Christ our Lord.
[3987.22 --> 3989.22]  Amen.
[3989.22 --> 3996.22]  I think Pastor Jason to have it right this time you're coming up.
[3996.22 --> 3998.22]  Okay.
[3998.22 --> 4006.22]  Would you please rise.
[4006.22 --> 4019.22]  We go out with God's blessing upon us and use the benediction the very last verse two verses from Ephesians chapter six.
[4019.22 --> 4023.22]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4023.22 --> 4029.22]  Peace to the brothers and sisters and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4029.22 --> 4035.22]  Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
[4035.22 --> 4036.22]  Amen.
[4036.22 --> 4041.22]  Please remain standing and we'll sing our final song.
[4041.22 --> 4044.22]  And we'll sing COUNTDESTER
