[337.30 --> 338.74]  be with us today.
[338.74 --> 343.62]  My name is Marian and I will be your worship leader for this morning.
[343.62 --> 347.90]  I have just one announcement and it's the same one we had last week.
[347.90 --> 350.86]  Basic skills, we have one more week to get ready for that.
[350.86 --> 356.00]  And so if you have some spare time, even if it's just one day and there's something, a
[356.00 --> 361.00]  spot you can fill in, please have a look at the sign up sheets in the foyer after the service.
[361.00 --> 362.00]  Thank you.

[363.74 --> 364.74]  God himself is with us.
[364.74 --> 365.48]  God himself is with us.
[365.48 --> 370.74]  God himself is with us.
[370.74 --> 372.48]  God himself is with us.
[372.48 --> 377.36]  Let us now adore him.
[377.36 --> 384.36]  God himself is with us.
[384.36 --> 387.36]  God himself is with us.
[387.36 --> 390.10]  God himself is with us.
[390.10 --> 392.10]  God himself is with us.
[392.10 --> 393.98]  Let us now adore him.
[393.98 --> 396.98]  God himself is with us.
[396.98 --> 399.98]  God himself is with us.
[399.98 --> 414.98]  God is in his temple, all within king silence, prostrate life with deepest reverence.
[414.98 --> 428.98]  God himself is with us.
[428.98 --> 435.98]  God himself is with us.
[435.98 --> 441.50]  Hear the hearts resounding
[441.50 --> 447.34]  See the crowds, the thrones surrounding
[447.34 --> 453.48]  Holy, holy, holy
[453.48 --> 458.28]  Hear the hymn ascending
[458.28 --> 463.70]  Angels sings their voices blending
[463.70 --> 470.72]  While you're here to us here
[470.72 --> 475.70]  Hear, O Christ, the praises
[475.70 --> 480.40]  That your church now raises
[480.40 --> 488.92]  Fount of every blessing
[488.92 --> 493.94]  Pure by my spirit
[493.94 --> 499.92]  Trusting only in your merit
[499.92 --> 505.92]  Like the holy angels
[505.92 --> 510.04]  Who behold your glory
[510.04 --> 517.06]  May I ceaselessly adore you
[517.06 --> 522.98]  And in all great and small
[522.98 --> 528.12]  Seek to do most dearly
[528.12 --> 533.26]  What do you love so dearly?
[533.26 --> 546.90]  God invites us with the words of Psalm 96, verses 1 to 3.
[547.08 --> 548.38]  Please follow along.
[549.82 --> 551.84]  Sing to the Lord a new song.
[552.28 --> 554.68]  Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[555.28 --> 558.08]  Sing to the Lord. Praise his name.
[558.08 --> 562.00]  Proclaim his salvation day after day.
[562.78 --> 565.44]  Declare his glory among the nations.
[566.04 --> 569.16]  His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[575.10 --> 576.78]  God greets us
[576.78 --> 580.50]  In the name of the Lord
[580.50 --> 581.90]  And the Father and the Son
[581.90 --> 582.98]  And the Holy Spirit
[582.98 --> 584.98]  Grace, mercy and peace
[584.98 --> 586.54]  Be yours in abundance.
[589.38 --> 591.40]  As God has greeted us
[591.40 --> 593.44]  Let us greet one another.
[593.44 --> 611.18]  And we'll be praying out
[611.18 --> 613.20]  We'll be doing this
[613.20 --> 613.58]  Good morning
[613.58 --> 613.72]  Good morning
[613.72 --> 614.16]  Good morning
[614.16 --> 618.16]  Good morning
[618.16 --> 620.20]  Good morning
[620.26 --> 620.72]  Good morning
[620.72 --> 621.50]  There nehme T a ceiling
[621.50 --> 638.94]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[638.94 --> 644.94]  Fast unmeasured, boundless free
[644.94 --> 651.94]  Rolling as a mighty ocean
[652.52 --> 658.94]  In its fullness over me
[659.46 --> 665.94]  Underneath me, all around me
[666.68 --> 672.94]  Is the current of your love
[672.94 --> 679.94]  Leading onward, leading homeward
[681.04 --> 687.94]  To your glorious rest above
[687.94 --> 696.94]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[696.94 --> 703.94]  Spread his praise from shore to shore
[703.94 --> 710.94]  How he came to pay a ransom
[710.94 --> 718.94]  Through the saving cross he bore
[718.94 --> 725.94]  How he watches for his loved ones
[725.94 --> 733.94]  Those he died to make his own
[733.94 --> 740.94]  How for them he's interceding
[740.94 --> 748.94]  Pleading now before the throne
[748.94 --> 755.94]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[755.94 --> 763.94]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[763.94 --> 770.94]  Are surpassing all the rest
[770.94 --> 778.94]  It's an ocean full of blessing
[778.94 --> 785.94]  In the midst of every test
[785.94 --> 793.94]  O the deep, deep love of Jesus
[793.94 --> 800.94]  Mighty Savior, precious friend
[800.94 --> 808.94]  You will bring us home to glory
[808.94 --> 815.94]  Where your love will never end
[815.94 --> 818.94]  Never end
[818.94 --> 822.94]  Never end
[822.94 --> 823.94]  Sandwich Lord
[823.94 --> 826.94]  Where痠żar
[827.94 --> 829.94]  Whole carbure
[829.94 --> 831.30]  Pour겨
[839.94 --> 844.94]  O Baile
[844.94 --> 863.72]  I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord.
[863.72 --> 873.48]  No tender voice like thine can peace afford.
[873.48 --> 884.78]  I need thee, oh I need thee, every hour I need thee.
[884.78 --> 895.28]  Oh bless me now my Savior, I come to thee.
[895.28 --> 906.28]  I need thee every hour, stay thou nearby.
[906.28 --> 917.28]  Temptations lose their power when thou art mine.
[917.28 --> 928.58]  I need thee, oh I need thee, every hour I need thee.
[928.58 --> 938.58]  Oh bless me now my Savior, I come to thee.
[938.58 --> 949.58]  I need thee every hour, teach me thy will.
[949.58 --> 960.58]  And thy rich promises in me fulfill.
[960.58 --> 971.58]  I need thee, oh I need thee, every hour I need thee.
[971.58 --> 982.58]  Oh bless me now my Savior, I come to thee.
[982.58 --> 1003.58]  I need thee every hour, most holy one.
[1003.58 --> 1012.58]  I need thee every hour, most holy one.
[1012.58 --> 1022.58]  Oh make me thine indeed, thou blessed Son.
[1022.58 --> 1033.58]  I need thee, oh I need thee, every hour I need thee.
[1033.58 --> 1043.58]  Oh bless me now my Savior, I come to thee.
[1043.58 --> 1055.58]  Oh my Savior, I come to thee.
[1055.58 --> 1060.98]  I made an omission this morning of my welcome, so I just want to let you know that a little
[1060.98 --> 1065.72]  later in the service we will be welcoming Pastor Albert Chu from Richmond.
[1065.72 --> 1069.44]  He's going to be bringing God's word to us this morning and we're very happy to have him
[1069.44 --> 1071.60]  here after I think quite a long absence.
[1071.76 --> 1072.34]  It's been a while.
[1072.34 --> 1079.34]  So, it'll be good to have you with us this morning, Pastor Albert.
[1079.34 --> 1084.34]  This is the time of the service.
[1084.34 --> 1086.34]  Actually, I'm going to let the kids go first.
[1086.34 --> 1091.34]  Let's let the kids go.
[1091.34 --> 1095.34]  Ages three to grade four can go to kids life.
[1095.34 --> 1100.34]  May you be blessed as you learn together.
[1100.34 --> 1121.34]  Every week we have a time of confession that allows us to reflect on who we are in our relationship
[1121.34 --> 1122.34]  with God.
[1122.34 --> 1128.34]  Our Lord Jesus said,
[1128.34 --> 1135.34]  Let us love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
[1135.34 --> 1138.34]  This is the greatest and the first commandment.
[1138.34 --> 1142.34]  And a second like it is, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[1142.34 --> 1147.34]  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
[1147.34 --> 1153.34]  As God instructed us in these great commandments, and because we have not lived in full obedience,
[1153.34 --> 1159.34]  let us now together confess our sins to God, trust in Christ as our Savior and Lord.
[1159.34 --> 1176.34]  Merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[1176.34 --> 1182.34]  We have not loved you with all heart and mind and strength.
[1182.34 --> 1186.34]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1186.34 --> 1191.34]  In your mercy, forgive what we have been.
[1191.34 --> 1205.34]  Help us amend what we are and direct what we shall be, so that we may delight in your will and walk in your ways to the glory of your holy name.
[1205.34 --> 1210.34]  Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
[1210.34 --> 1216.34]  We are comforted and helped by the words of Hebrews 4, verses 14 to 16.
[1216.34 --> 1227.34]  So then, since we have a great high priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe.
[1227.34 --> 1237.34]  This high priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.
[1237.34 --> 1242.34]  So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God.
[1242.34 --> 1249.34]  There we will receive his mercy and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.
[1249.34 --> 1251.34]  Let us sing.
[1251.34 --> 1272.34]  Before the throne of God above.
[1272.34 --> 1281.24]  Before the throne of God above
[1281.24 --> 1286.26]  I have a strong and perfect plea
[1286.26 --> 1291.40]  A great high priest whose name is love
[1291.40 --> 1296.36]  Whoever lives and pleads for me
[1296.36 --> 1302.26]  My name is graven on his hands
[1302.26 --> 1307.48]  My name is written on his heart
[1307.48 --> 1312.70]  I know that while in heaven he stands
[1312.70 --> 1317.26]  No tongue can bid me then depart
[1317.26 --> 1323.26]  No tongue can bid me then depart
[1323.26 --> 1331.38]  Behold him there, the risen Lamb
[1331.38 --> 1335.60]  My perfect spotless righteousness
[1335.60 --> 1341.50]  The great unchangeable I am
[1341.50 --> 1346.60]  The King of glory and of grace
[1346.60 --> 1352.60]  One with himself I cannot die
[1352.60 --> 1358.12]  My soul is purchased by his blood
[1358.12 --> 1363.42]  My life is hid with Christ on high
[1363.42 --> 1368.82]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[1368.82 --> 1374.04]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[1374.04 --> 1395.20]  The scripture reading for today is from Luke 5, verse 27 to 32
[1395.20 --> 1399.42]  After this Jesus went out and saw a tax collector
[1399.42 --> 1403.08]  By the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth
[1403.08 --> 1405.88]  Follow me, Jesus said to him
[1405.88 --> 1410.36]  And Levi got up, left everything and followed him
[1410.36 --> 1414.90]  Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house
[1414.90 --> 1417.70]  And a large crowd of tax collectors
[1417.70 --> 1419.58]  And others were eating with them
[1419.58 --> 1423.04]  But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[1423.04 --> 1424.52]  Who belonged to their sect
[1424.52 --> 1426.78]  Complained to his disciples
[1426.78 --> 1430.14]  Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors
[1430.14 --> 1431.28]  And sinners?
[1432.28 --> 1433.66]  Jesus answered them
[1433.66 --> 1436.28]  It is not the healthy who need a doctor
[1436.28 --> 1437.38]  But the sick
[1437.38 --> 1440.18]  I have not come to call the righteous
[1440.18 --> 1442.30]  But sinners to repentance
[1442.30 --> 1444.86]  This is the word of the Lord
[1444.86 --> 1446.76]  Thanks be to God
[1446.76 --> 1456.80]  Father God, we thank you for a chance to come here
[1456.80 --> 1459.34]  This Sunday morning to worship you
[1459.34 --> 1460.54]  And to hear your word
[1460.54 --> 1462.56]  And we ask for your blessing now
[1462.56 --> 1464.28]  As we come to your word
[1464.28 --> 1468.78]  That we would come to read a familiar story to many of us
[1468.78 --> 1471.82]  But that it would come afresh on us
[1471.82 --> 1474.28]  As it teaches again what it means
[1474.28 --> 1476.78]  To be a faithful disciple of your son Jesus
[1476.78 --> 1478.58]  So come spirit, come
[1478.58 --> 1480.50]  And speak to us this morning
[1480.50 --> 1482.34]  We pray this in Jesus' name
[1482.34 --> 1483.24]  Amen
[1483.24 --> 1485.60]  Good morning everyone
[1485.60 --> 1487.50]  So delighted to be here
[1487.50 --> 1489.26]  I checked while you said
[1489.26 --> 1491.16]  It has been a while since I've been here
[1491.16 --> 1492.84]  The last time I was here
[1492.84 --> 1495.28]  August 8th, last year
[1495.28 --> 1497.34]  So exactly a year from now
[1497.34 --> 1499.40]  So it always seems to be
[1499.40 --> 1501.28]  I always make my kind of trip
[1501.28 --> 1503.22]  Ladner CRC once a year
[1503.22 --> 1504.90]  I'm always delighted to be here
[1504.90 --> 1506.82]  And good to be here on this Sunday
[1506.82 --> 1507.72]  If we haven't met
[1507.72 --> 1508.46]  My name is Albert
[1508.46 --> 1511.24]  I'm the lead pastor of the Tapestry Church Network
[1511.24 --> 1514.36]  And so good to be here again with you
[1514.36 --> 1516.76]  So one of the things that I love to do
[1516.76 --> 1518.16]  Especially in the summer
[1518.16 --> 1519.58]  Is to eat
[1519.58 --> 1521.64]  So how many of you like to eat
[1521.64 --> 1523.02]  You know barbecues and so forth
[1523.02 --> 1523.34]  Yes
[1523.34 --> 1524.76]  Some of you don't
[1524.76 --> 1525.54]  That's interesting
[1525.54 --> 1525.94]  Okay
[1525.94 --> 1528.08]  So you know
[1528.08 --> 1528.76]  I love to eat
[1528.76 --> 1530.30]  And one of the things I love to do
[1530.30 --> 1530.94]  Is to eat
[1530.94 --> 1532.86]  And it doesn't matter if it's old friends
[1532.86 --> 1533.80]  Or new friends
[1533.80 --> 1535.54]  I just don't like eating alone
[1535.54 --> 1536.26]  Right
[1536.26 --> 1538.44]  I just love eating with my family
[1538.44 --> 1539.36]  My wife
[1539.36 --> 1540.06]  With friends
[1540.06 --> 1542.42]  And just having a nice long meal
[1542.42 --> 1544.94]  Because there's just something about that
[1544.94 --> 1547.84]  Now if you could possibly eat
[1547.84 --> 1549.46]  Any meal in the world
[1549.46 --> 1550.72]  With someone
[1550.72 --> 1552.34]  Who would that be?
[1552.34 --> 1553.58]  Anyone
[1553.58 --> 1555.48]  Like past, present, or future
[1555.48 --> 1556.58]  If you could
[1556.58 --> 1557.66]  Sit down
[1557.66 --> 1558.54]  And enjoy a meal
[1558.54 --> 1559.44]  With anyone
[1559.44 --> 1561.80]  In the history of the world
[1561.80 --> 1564.80]  Who would you want to eat with?
[1565.80 --> 1566.14]  Alright
[1566.14 --> 1566.98]  I'm going to give you
[1566.98 --> 1569.00]  38 seconds
[1569.00 --> 1570.60]  To turn to your neighbor
[1570.60 --> 1571.60]  And to discuss
[1571.60 --> 1573.80]  Who you would want that meal to be with
[1573.80 --> 1574.08]  Alright
[1574.08 --> 1574.84]  Okay
[1574.84 --> 1575.74]  Go
[1575.74 --> 1595.30]  Alright
[1595.30 --> 1598.20]  We'll go on this kind of side
[1598.20 --> 1599.44]  Someone just blurt out
[1599.44 --> 1600.82]  Who would you want to eat your meal with?
[1601.02 --> 1601.74]  John Cena
[1601.74 --> 1603.12]  John Cena
[1603.12 --> 1606.16]  For those of you that do not know
[1606.16 --> 1607.66]  I think he was an ex-wrestler
[1607.66 --> 1608.32]  Am I correct?
[1608.86 --> 1609.24]  Yes
[1609.24 --> 1609.92]  I got one
[1609.92 --> 1611.96]  I know nothing more about that
[1611.96 --> 1613.76]  Okay
[1613.76 --> 1615.38]  How about on this middle section
[1615.38 --> 1616.80]  Who would you like to eat a meal with?
[1617.32 --> 1617.98]  Martin Luther
[1617.98 --> 1618.80]  Martin Luther
[1618.80 --> 1619.28]  Yes
[1619.28 --> 1621.00]  How can you go wrong with Martin Luther?
[1621.14 --> 1621.34]  Really
[1621.34 --> 1622.36]  That would have been really cool
[1622.36 --> 1624.46]  Martin Luther and Martin Luther King
[1624.46 --> 1626.02]  Can you imagine both of them together?
[1626.54 --> 1627.22]  That would be crazy
[1627.22 --> 1627.58]  Okay
[1627.58 --> 1629.06]  And then this side
[1629.06 --> 1630.58]  Who would you want to eat a meal with?
[1631.46 --> 1631.88]  Jesus
[1631.88 --> 1632.50]  Okay
[1632.50 --> 1635.24]  That's a very good church answer
[1635.24 --> 1636.04]  I appreciate that
[1636.04 --> 1639.36]  Well a number of years ago
[1639.36 --> 1641.98]  Two of the more influential people in my life
[1641.98 --> 1644.60]  Were found having a conversation with each other
[1644.60 --> 1646.36]  They weren't necessarily eating a meal
[1646.36 --> 1647.96]  But there was a cheese tray
[1647.96 --> 1650.02]  And cookies and coffee and so forth
[1650.02 --> 1652.54]  And they are depicted in this picture behind me
[1652.54 --> 1653.96]  They are Eugene Peterson
[1653.96 --> 1655.52]  Who's on your right
[1655.52 --> 1657.78]  As well as Bono who's in the middle
[1657.78 --> 1660.14]  And they're talking about the Psalms
[1660.14 --> 1662.92]  And that's who I'd like to share a meal with
[1662.92 --> 1664.18]  Eugene Peterson
[1664.18 --> 1665.70]  The author of The Message
[1665.70 --> 1668.54]  And professor at Regent College
[1668.54 --> 1671.90]  Is probably the author I quote most often
[1671.90 --> 1672.94]  I've read all his books
[1672.94 --> 1676.64]  Unfortunately Eugene passed away October in 2018
[1676.64 --> 1680.10]  And I have shared a number of meals with Eugene
[1680.10 --> 1680.96]  When I was at Regent
[1680.96 --> 1682.64]  Maybe 18 to 20 meals
[1682.64 --> 1685.26]  I've had a chance to sit down and talk to him
[1685.26 --> 1687.84]  But to have Bono there as well
[1687.84 --> 1689.76]  Would be absolutely ridiculous
[1689.76 --> 1693.12]  Bono being of course the frontman of U2
[1693.12 --> 1694.74]  My favourite band of all time
[1694.74 --> 1697.42]  And influential in just sort of my own theology
[1697.42 --> 1700.08]  I think it would have been an excellent conversation
[1700.08 --> 1702.70]  Now the person interviewing them to the left
[1702.70 --> 1704.46]  Is a person named David Taylor
[1704.46 --> 1706.32]  He's a professor at Fuller right now
[1706.32 --> 1708.78]  But I went to school with David
[1708.78 --> 1711.40]  So really I think I should be there
[1711.40 --> 1713.14]  And at least I can pretend
[1713.14 --> 1713.72]  Next picture
[1713.72 --> 1717.70]  It almost looked like pretty good hey
[1717.70 --> 1721.76]  So today we're obviously going to talk about eating
[1721.76 --> 1724.50]  And in fact specifically about one of the meals
[1724.50 --> 1727.22]  That Jesus ate in the Gospel of Luke
[1727.22 --> 1730.24]  In fact eating is one of the most reoccurring things
[1730.24 --> 1732.06]  That happens in the Gospel of Luke
[1732.06 --> 1733.00]  That if you read it
[1733.00 --> 1736.42]  Jesus is always coming from or going to a meal
[1736.42 --> 1737.84]  At least ten different occasions
[1737.84 --> 1740.34]  Jesus can be found sitting there
[1740.34 --> 1743.04]  Eating and sharing a meal with others
[1743.04 --> 1744.78]  Now the first story in Luke
[1744.78 --> 1746.36]  Chronologically at least
[1746.36 --> 1747.80]  Of Jesus eating a meal
[1747.80 --> 1749.34]  Is found in Luke chapter 5
[1749.34 --> 1750.24]  Pretty early on
[1750.24 --> 1752.04]  And it's of him eating a meal
[1752.04 --> 1753.46]  With a man named Levi
[1753.46 --> 1755.32]  And we're going to get to that story
[1755.32 --> 1758.02]  But we're going to start off in Luke chapter 5
[1758.02 --> 1759.94]  That same chapter in chapter 1
[1759.94 --> 1761.62]  Just to give us a little context
[1761.62 --> 1763.80]  Of what we're going to be talking about
[1763.80 --> 1764.66]  When we get to Levi
[1764.66 --> 1766.34]  So Luke chapter 5
[1766.34 --> 1767.50]  I'm going to start in verse 1
[1767.50 --> 1768.62]  And it begins like this
[1768.62 --> 1771.02]  One day as Jesus was standing by
[1771.02 --> 1772.12]  The lake of Gennesaret
[1772.12 --> 1773.90]  Which is another name for Galilee
[1773.90 --> 1775.98]  The people were crowding around him
[1775.98 --> 1777.42]  And listening to the word of God
[1777.42 --> 1779.92]  He saw at the water's edge two boats
[1779.92 --> 1781.84]  Left there by the fishermen
[1781.84 --> 1783.94]  Who were washing their nets
[1783.94 --> 1785.70]  He got into one of the boats
[1785.70 --> 1787.04]  The one belonging to Simon
[1787.04 --> 1789.60]  And asked him to put out a little from shore
[1789.60 --> 1791.14]  Then he sat down
[1791.14 --> 1793.68]  And taught the people from the boat
[1793.68 --> 1795.98]  Now the scene begins with Jesus
[1795.98 --> 1797.42]  On the shores of the Galilee
[1797.42 --> 1799.06]  Teaching before a large crowd
[1799.06 --> 1800.66]  And more and more people
[1800.66 --> 1801.64]  Were coming towards him
[1801.64 --> 1802.40]  To listen to him
[1802.40 --> 1804.42]  And so feeling a bit claustrophobic
[1804.42 --> 1805.24]  And nowhere to go
[1805.24 --> 1806.94]  Since he's on the water's edge
[1806.94 --> 1808.98]  Jesus has this brilliant idea
[1808.98 --> 1811.18]  Nearby were a bunch of fishermen
[1811.18 --> 1812.10]  Who had just come in
[1812.10 --> 1813.40]  From a night of fishing
[1813.40 --> 1815.20]  So he jumped into one of the boats
[1815.20 --> 1816.26]  Asked them to push out
[1816.26 --> 1817.34]  A little out of the sea
[1817.34 --> 1819.20]  So he could continue his teaching
[1819.20 --> 1820.70]  Have a little buffer zone
[1820.70 --> 1822.46]  And supposedly
[1822.46 --> 1823.94]  Water travels better
[1823.94 --> 1825.58]  I mean sound travels better
[1825.58 --> 1826.24]  Over water
[1826.24 --> 1827.70]  So more people
[1827.70 --> 1828.78]  Could listen to him
[1828.78 --> 1830.28]  The story continues
[1830.28 --> 1830.92]  In verse four
[1830.92 --> 1833.06]  When he had finished speaking
[1833.06 --> 1834.34]  He said to Simon
[1834.34 --> 1836.26]  Put out into deep water
[1836.26 --> 1837.42]  And let down the nets
[1837.42 --> 1838.18]  For a catch
[1838.18 --> 1839.34]  Simon answered
[1839.34 --> 1841.14]  Master we worked hard all night
[1841.14 --> 1842.32]  And haven't caught anything
[1842.32 --> 1846.08]  But because you say so
[1846.08 --> 1847.92]  I will let down the nets
[1847.92 --> 1849.68]  Now Simon's words
[1849.68 --> 1850.98]  Betray a bit of skepticism
[1850.98 --> 1851.50]  Don't they
[1851.50 --> 1852.66]  In the first place
[1852.66 --> 1853.68]  Simon's words indicate
[1853.68 --> 1854.56]  That he and his partners
[1854.56 --> 1855.26]  Were exhausted
[1855.26 --> 1856.84]  They had worked all night
[1856.84 --> 1858.52]  Fishing and they had caught nothing
[1858.52 --> 1859.32]  And they had just
[1859.32 --> 1861.18]  Done the laborious work
[1861.18 --> 1862.26]  Of cleaning the nets
[1862.26 --> 1863.10]  They'd have to do that
[1863.10 --> 1864.04]  All over again
[1864.04 --> 1865.40]  But secondly
[1865.40 --> 1866.24]  Simon indicates
[1866.24 --> 1867.00]  That their efforts
[1867.00 --> 1868.02]  Have been futile
[1868.02 --> 1870.74]  Night was the best time to fish
[1870.74 --> 1872.54]  If they had not caught anything at night
[1872.54 --> 1873.18]  How on earth
[1873.18 --> 1874.52]  Are they going to catch anything at day
[1874.52 --> 1876.18]  Which was the worst time to fish
[1876.18 --> 1877.80]  Thirdly
[1877.80 --> 1880.52]  There's a hint of irritation here I think
[1880.52 --> 1881.66]  Did Jesus
[1881.66 --> 1882.44]  This carpenter
[1882.44 --> 1883.52]  This so-called rabbi
[1883.52 --> 1884.66]  Think he knew more about
[1884.66 --> 1885.92]  Fishing than me
[1885.92 --> 1886.52]  Third
[1886.52 --> 1888.02]  Fourth generation fishermen
[1888.02 --> 1889.66]  Nevertheless
[1889.66 --> 1891.22]  It must have been
[1891.22 --> 1892.38]  Something Jesus said
[1892.38 --> 1894.28]  Or the way Jesus said it
[1894.28 --> 1895.82]  That moved Simon
[1895.82 --> 1897.44]  For Simon relents
[1897.44 --> 1898.94]  Paddles back in the sea
[1898.94 --> 1899.98]  Let's down the nets
[1899.98 --> 1901.48]  And what happens next
[1901.48 --> 1903.16]  The result is
[1903.16 --> 1904.06]  Absolutely
[1904.06 --> 1905.40]  Incredible
[1905.40 --> 1906.82]  Verse 6
[1906.82 --> 1908.64]  When they had done so
[1908.64 --> 1911.62]  They caught such a large number of fish
[1911.62 --> 1913.80]  That their nets began to break
[1913.80 --> 1915.62]  So they signaled their partners
[1915.62 --> 1916.36]  In the other boat
[1916.36 --> 1917.60]  To come and help them
[1917.60 --> 1919.92]  And they came and filled both boats
[1919.92 --> 1920.76]  So full
[1920.76 --> 1922.54]  That they began to sink
[1922.54 --> 1924.26]  When Simon Peter saw this
[1924.26 --> 1925.44]  He fell at Jesus' knees
[1925.44 --> 1925.90]  And said
[1925.90 --> 1927.22]  Go away from me Lord
[1927.22 --> 1929.00]  I am a sinful man
[1929.00 --> 1930.18]  For all
[1930.18 --> 1931.62]  For he and all his companions
[1931.62 --> 1932.68]  Were astonished
[1932.68 --> 1933.86]  At the catch of fish
[1933.86 --> 1934.52]  They had taken
[1934.52 --> 1936.16]  And so were James and John
[1936.16 --> 1937.18]  The sons of Zebedee
[1937.18 --> 1938.00]  Simon's partners
[1938.00 --> 1939.82]  Then Jesus said to Simon
[1939.82 --> 1940.72]  Don't be afraid
[1940.72 --> 1942.02]  From now on
[1942.02 --> 1943.28]  You will fish for people
[1943.28 --> 1945.20]  So they pulled their boats up
[1945.20 --> 1945.88]  On shore
[1945.88 --> 1947.24]  Left everything
[1947.24 --> 1948.66]  And followed him
[1948.66 --> 1950.28]  Now there are these
[1950.28 --> 1951.54]  Exaggerated stories
[1951.54 --> 1953.18]  That fishermen always tell
[1953.18 --> 1953.48]  Right
[1953.48 --> 1954.66]  About how they worked
[1954.66 --> 1955.40]  Day and hard
[1955.40 --> 1957.84]  And finally after a few hours
[1957.84 --> 1959.66]  They caught like a 600 pound
[1959.66 --> 1960.42]  Mahi-mahi
[1960.42 --> 1961.56]  Or something like that
[1961.56 --> 1964.04]  But this story beats them all
[1964.04 --> 1966.92]  The nets were absolutely so full
[1966.92 --> 1969.04]  That they began to tear apart
[1969.04 --> 1970.84]  They signaled their partners for help
[1970.84 --> 1971.78]  And even with two ships
[1971.78 --> 1972.80]  The catch was so full
[1972.80 --> 1974.20]  That it caused the boats
[1974.20 --> 1975.50]  To begin to sink
[1975.50 --> 1976.62]  Friends
[1976.62 --> 1978.86]  This was a catch of a lifetime
[1978.86 --> 1981.48]  Falling down at the feet of Jesus
[1981.48 --> 1982.72]  Simon now sees Jesus
[1982.72 --> 1983.92]  In an entirely different light
[1983.92 --> 1985.02]  Back in verse 5
[1985.02 --> 1986.44]  Simon calls Jesus master
[1986.44 --> 1987.22]  But now
[1987.22 --> 1989.02]  Note that Simon calls Jesus
[1989.02 --> 1989.86]  Lord
[1989.86 --> 1992.20]  This change of terms
[1992.20 --> 1994.28]  Is a signal of a quantum leap
[1994.28 --> 1996.18]  In Simon's understanding of Jesus
[1996.18 --> 1997.52]  That having experienced
[1997.52 --> 1998.98]  First hand this amazing miracle
[1998.98 --> 2001.06]  Simon now begins to see Jesus
[2001.06 --> 2002.68]  For who he really is
[2002.68 --> 2003.68]  Lord
[2003.68 --> 2005.70]  And just like that
[2005.70 --> 2007.66]  They pulled their boats to shore
[2007.66 --> 2008.46]  Dropped everything
[2008.46 --> 2009.22]  Turned their backs
[2009.22 --> 2010.70]  On the biggest catch of their lives
[2010.70 --> 2012.48]  And from that day on
[2012.48 --> 2013.92]  Followed him
[2013.92 --> 2015.62]  From that point on
[2015.62 --> 2016.00]  Simon
[2016.00 --> 2017.08]  His brother Andrew
[2017.08 --> 2018.40]  As well as the fishing partners
[2018.40 --> 2019.38]  James and John
[2019.38 --> 2020.86]  Would leave their jobs
[2020.86 --> 2021.62]  As fishermen
[2021.62 --> 2023.18]  And follow Jesus
[2023.18 --> 2024.62]  They would leave their homes
[2024.62 --> 2025.64]  They would leave their families
[2025.64 --> 2027.22]  They would leave their towns
[2027.22 --> 2029.22]  And follow Jesus
[2029.22 --> 2031.32]  From this time on too
[2031.32 --> 2033.60]  Simon will now be known
[2033.60 --> 2035.32]  As Peter
[2035.32 --> 2037.96]  And no longer will they catch fish
[2037.96 --> 2040.36]  But now they will fish for people
[2040.36 --> 2041.90]  They will seek to bring people
[2041.90 --> 2043.40]  Who are swimming aimlessly
[2043.40 --> 2044.06]  Through life
[2044.06 --> 2046.32]  Into the loving and merciful net
[2046.32 --> 2047.40]  Of God's love
[2047.40 --> 2048.74]  Great story right
[2048.74 --> 2050.36]  Familiar one to many of us
[2050.36 --> 2052.14]  Where were you
[2052.14 --> 2053.58]  When you first encountered Jesus
[2053.58 --> 2055.78]  Like really encountered Jesus
[2055.78 --> 2057.10]  For the very first time
[2057.10 --> 2058.68]  Like Peter and his friends
[2058.68 --> 2059.78]  Maybe it was at work
[2059.78 --> 2062.52]  When Jesus miraculously showed up
[2062.52 --> 2064.20]  Or maybe you were at school
[2064.20 --> 2065.62]  Or on a missions trip
[2065.62 --> 2067.94]  Or on a particular Sunday at church
[2067.94 --> 2069.70]  I noted on the bulletin
[2069.70 --> 2070.42]  That next week
[2070.42 --> 2072.62]  You have a basic skills workshop
[2072.62 --> 2073.66]  Or the kids camp
[2073.66 --> 2077.10]  Maybe that opportunity
[2077.10 --> 2077.88]  Will be a time
[2077.88 --> 2079.02]  Where a child who comes
[2079.02 --> 2080.96]  Will hear and experience Jesus
[2080.96 --> 2082.40]  For the very first time
[2082.40 --> 2085.70]  When did you first encounter Jesus?
[2086.48 --> 2087.54]  Because when you do everything
[2087.54 --> 2088.92]  And I mean everything
[2088.92 --> 2091.32]  Changes, doesn't it?
[2092.30 --> 2093.32]  So let's continue now
[2093.32 --> 2095.04]  As we narrow in
[2095.04 --> 2097.42]  On another life-changing experience
[2097.42 --> 2100.20]  Another disciple that Jesus picks
[2100.20 --> 2102.64]  A man named Levi
[2102.64 --> 2104.46]  So we're going to pick things up
[2104.46 --> 2105.90]  Verse 27, same chapter
[2105.90 --> 2107.00]  And it begins like this
[2107.00 --> 2108.52]  After this
[2108.52 --> 2109.94]  Jesus went out
[2109.94 --> 2111.30]  And saw a tax collector
[2111.30 --> 2112.40]  By the name of Levi
[2112.40 --> 2114.16]  Sitting at his tax booth
[2114.16 --> 2116.32]  Follow me, Jesus said to him
[2116.32 --> 2117.22]  And Levi got up
[2117.22 --> 2118.02]  Left everything
[2118.02 --> 2119.32]  And followed him
[2119.32 --> 2122.26]  Then Levi had a great banquet
[2122.26 --> 2123.58]  For Jesus at his house
[2123.58 --> 2125.06]  And a large crowd
[2125.06 --> 2125.08]  And a large crowd
[2125.08 --> 2125.98]  Of tax collectors
[2125.98 --> 2126.46]  And others
[2126.46 --> 2127.38]  Were eating with him
[2127.38 --> 2128.84]  But the Pharisees
[2128.84 --> 2129.76]  And the teachers of the law
[2129.76 --> 2131.30]  Who belonged to their sect
[2131.30 --> 2132.52]  Complained to his disciples
[2132.52 --> 2134.82]  Why do you eat
[2134.82 --> 2136.24]  With tax collectors
[2136.24 --> 2137.08]  And sinners?
[2138.08 --> 2139.08]  Jesus answered them
[2139.08 --> 2140.64]  It is not the healthy
[2140.64 --> 2141.50]  Who need a doctor
[2141.50 --> 2142.66]  But the sick
[2142.66 --> 2143.72]  I have not come
[2143.72 --> 2144.76]  To call the righteous
[2144.76 --> 2146.12]  But sinners
[2146.12 --> 2147.52]  To repentance
[2147.52 --> 2149.74]  Now we read that Levi
[2149.74 --> 2150.94]  Was a tax collector
[2150.94 --> 2151.50]  And by the way
[2151.50 --> 2152.64]  Levi will become
[2152.64 --> 2153.40]  To be known
[2153.40 --> 2154.50]  By his other name
[2154.50 --> 2155.68]  Matthew
[2155.68 --> 2158.30]  Levi was a tax collector
[2158.30 --> 2159.82]  And in the first century
[2159.82 --> 2160.82]  It was pretty much
[2160.82 --> 2162.14]  The most despicable job
[2162.14 --> 2163.78]  A Jew could possibly have
[2163.78 --> 2164.72]  Why?
[2165.36 --> 2166.30]  Well as you know
[2166.30 --> 2167.38]  The Jews had been conquered
[2167.38 --> 2168.06]  By the Romans
[2168.06 --> 2169.28]  And they were forced
[2169.28 --> 2170.50]  To pay heavy taxes
[2170.50 --> 2171.26]  To Caesar
[2171.26 --> 2172.92]  So Levi not only
[2172.92 --> 2173.78]  Worked for Rome
[2173.78 --> 2174.72]  He worked for the enemy
[2174.72 --> 2176.74]  But he would collect money
[2176.74 --> 2177.92]  From his fellow Jews
[2177.92 --> 2179.20]  And he would take a cut
[2179.20 --> 2180.84]  Or skim some of that money
[2180.84 --> 2182.48]  From his own fellow
[2182.48 --> 2183.50]  Country people
[2183.50 --> 2185.26]  And put it in his own pocket
[2185.26 --> 2187.40]  In other words
[2187.40 --> 2188.88]  He was a godless
[2188.88 --> 2189.68]  Corrupt
[2189.68 --> 2190.62]  Greedy
[2190.62 --> 2191.62]  Traitor
[2191.62 --> 2193.16]  It was so bad
[2193.16 --> 2194.38]  That being a tax collector
[2194.38 --> 2194.80]  Back then
[2194.80 --> 2195.50]  Was synonymous
[2195.50 --> 2196.28]  With being
[2196.28 --> 2197.78]  Something called
[2197.78 --> 2198.28]  A sinner
[2198.28 --> 2200.04]  And on social par
[2200.04 --> 2201.24]  With gluttons
[2201.24 --> 2201.76]  Drunkards
[2201.76 --> 2202.44]  And harlots
[2202.44 --> 2203.56]  More than that
[2203.56 --> 2204.70]  If you were a tax collector
[2204.70 --> 2205.52]  You and your family
[2205.52 --> 2206.50]  Were actually considered
[2206.50 --> 2208.14]  To be unclean
[2208.14 --> 2209.68]  That means you couldn't
[2209.68 --> 2210.46]  Walk into their house
[2210.46 --> 2211.30]  Sit on their chair
[2211.30 --> 2212.04]  Eat their food
[2212.04 --> 2213.00]  Without at least
[2213.00 --> 2214.20]  A week of purification
[2214.20 --> 2216.90]  But scandal of scandals
[2216.90 --> 2218.34]  Jesus walks up
[2218.34 --> 2219.16]  To this sinner
[2219.16 --> 2220.90]  Unclean tax collector
[2220.90 --> 2222.50]  And invites him
[2222.50 --> 2224.72]  Him of all people
[2224.72 --> 2226.50]  To follow me
[2226.50 --> 2228.10]  Now next picture
[2228.10 --> 2229.04]  Is this great picture
[2229.04 --> 2230.32]  By the Italian artist
[2230.32 --> 2230.94]  Caravaggio
[2230.94 --> 2231.60]  If you can have
[2231.60 --> 2232.32]  The slide there
[2232.32 --> 2233.96]  Completed in 1600
[2233.96 --> 2235.34]  The painting is located
[2235.34 --> 2236.50]  In the St. Luigi
[2236.50 --> 2238.18]  De Francesca church
[2238.18 --> 2238.86]  In Rome
[2238.86 --> 2239.76]  And it's been
[2239.76 --> 2240.84]  In that same location
[2240.84 --> 2241.88]  In the same church
[2241.88 --> 2244.10]  For the past 420 years
[2244.10 --> 2245.66]  Which is crazy
[2245.66 --> 2246.26]  If you think about it
[2246.26 --> 2246.96]  Because that painting
[2246.96 --> 2247.46]  And the church
[2247.46 --> 2248.48]  Where it's founded
[2248.48 --> 2249.88]  Is older than Canada
[2249.88 --> 2252.64]  So I've seen this painting
[2252.64 --> 2253.18]  In person
[2253.18 --> 2254.52]  And it's kind of crazy
[2254.52 --> 2255.70]  You just walk into the church
[2255.70 --> 2256.66]  You don't have to pay anything
[2256.66 --> 2257.54]  You go I think
[2257.54 --> 2258.82]  To the far left aisle
[2258.82 --> 2260.38]  And you get to the end
[2260.38 --> 2262.66]  Kind of little chapel there
[2262.66 --> 2263.20]  You look up
[2263.20 --> 2263.82]  And there are three
[2263.82 --> 2265.88]  Caravagos staring your face
[2265.88 --> 2267.52]  And this painting
[2267.52 --> 2269.22]  Which is pretty much
[2269.22 --> 2270.64]  As big as the screen
[2270.64 --> 2271.70]  Behind me
[2271.70 --> 2273.44]  Depicts Matthew
[2273.44 --> 2275.42]  Sitting at his tax collector
[2275.42 --> 2276.74]  Table with four other men
[2276.74 --> 2278.64]  And Jesus and Peter
[2278.64 --> 2280.52]  Have just entered the room
[2280.52 --> 2281.12]  On the right
[2281.12 --> 2282.00]  And I wish you could see
[2282.00 --> 2282.68]  It a little brighter
[2282.68 --> 2283.64]  If you need to
[2283.64 --> 2284.72]  You can go home
[2284.72 --> 2285.32]  And just text
[2285.32 --> 2286.46]  The calling of Levi
[2286.46 --> 2287.30]  Caravaggio
[2287.30 --> 2288.50]  And look at the picture
[2288.50 --> 2290.64]  The first thing of interest
[2290.64 --> 2291.86]  For me is the light
[2291.86 --> 2293.06]  And I think you can see
[2293.06 --> 2293.66]  It a little bit
[2293.66 --> 2295.36]  It's almost as if
[2295.36 --> 2296.28]  Jesus is bringing
[2296.28 --> 2297.98]  A spotlight into the room
[2297.98 --> 2299.88]  That shines the dark space
[2299.88 --> 2300.90]  On the tax collectors
[2300.90 --> 2301.70]  Which makes sense
[2301.70 --> 2303.54]  Jesus is the light of the world
[2303.54 --> 2304.30]  When he comes in
[2304.30 --> 2304.86]  He shines
[2304.86 --> 2306.36]  He illuminates things
[2306.36 --> 2308.32]  But the second thing
[2308.32 --> 2309.22]  Of interest is
[2309.22 --> 2311.22]  Which of these people
[2311.22 --> 2312.78]  Is Matthew
[2312.78 --> 2314.40]  Now most writers
[2314.40 --> 2315.12]  Assume Matthew
[2315.12 --> 2316.40]  Is the bearded man
[2316.40 --> 2317.42]  And he looks like
[2317.42 --> 2318.50]  He's pointing himself
[2318.50 --> 2319.54]  Saying me
[2319.54 --> 2320.54]  And I've enlarged
[2320.54 --> 2321.08]  In that portion
[2321.08 --> 2321.50]  Of the picture
[2321.50 --> 2322.00]  Next slide
[2322.00 --> 2323.24]  So there's this bearded man
[2323.24 --> 2324.22]  You can kind of see
[2324.22 --> 2325.10]  On the
[2325.10 --> 2326.30]  Your right
[2326.30 --> 2327.24]  And he's pointing
[2327.24 --> 2328.88]  But you know
[2328.88 --> 2329.60]  Most people think
[2329.60 --> 2330.16]  That's him
[2330.16 --> 2331.14]  But if you look
[2331.14 --> 2331.60]  At the picture
[2331.60 --> 2332.56]  It's almost as if
[2332.56 --> 2333.22]  He's not pointing
[2333.22 --> 2333.98]  To himself
[2333.98 --> 2335.12]  But he's pointing
[2335.12 --> 2336.42]  To the young man
[2336.42 --> 2337.46]  Who's sitting there
[2337.46 --> 2338.48]  So consumed
[2338.48 --> 2339.18]  With greed
[2339.18 --> 2340.52]  That he's painlessly
[2340.52 --> 2343.80]  Counting every single dollar
[2343.80 --> 2345.32]  That he has stolen
[2345.32 --> 2346.92]  From other people
[2346.92 --> 2348.58]  And it looks like
[2348.58 --> 2349.18]  You know
[2349.18 --> 2350.98]  The older bearded man
[2350.98 --> 2351.86]  Is not saying me
[2351.86 --> 2352.60]  But he's saying
[2352.60 --> 2354.08]  Him
[2354.08 --> 2355.72]  And in that tone
[2355.72 --> 2356.56]  Him
[2356.56 --> 2357.88]  Levi
[2357.88 --> 2359.22]  You're asking
[2359.22 --> 2361.06]  And maybe
[2361.06 --> 2361.58]  Caravaggio
[2361.58 --> 2362.54]  Is trying to be
[2362.54 --> 2363.20]  Ambiguous
[2363.20 --> 2364.26]  Because Jesus
[2364.26 --> 2364.90]  Comes
[2364.90 --> 2366.02]  Not only to call
[2366.02 --> 2366.34]  Levi
[2366.34 --> 2367.74]  But every single
[2367.74 --> 2368.42]  One of us
[2368.42 --> 2369.32]  To follow him
[2369.32 --> 2370.52]  Nevertheless
[2370.52 --> 2371.46]  Jesus walks
[2371.46 --> 2371.90]  Into the room
[2371.90 --> 2372.80]  Points to Matthew
[2372.80 --> 2373.30]  Whether he be
[2373.30 --> 2373.96]  The bearded man
[2373.96 --> 2374.74]  Or the younger man
[2374.74 --> 2375.70]  And says to him
[2375.70 --> 2376.90]  Follow me
[2376.90 --> 2379.02]  But what is also
[2379.02 --> 2379.60]  Interesting
[2379.60 --> 2381.32]  Is the shape
[2381.32 --> 2382.44]  Of Jesus' hand
[2382.44 --> 2383.22]  And I've enlarged
[2383.22 --> 2383.62]  It here
[2383.62 --> 2384.30]  So next slide
[2384.30 --> 2385.48]  You can barely tell
[2385.48 --> 2386.56]  But Jesus' hand
[2386.56 --> 2387.32]  Is pointing
[2387.32 --> 2389.16]  To Matthew
[2389.16 --> 2390.92]  But where have you
[2390.92 --> 2392.42]  Seen that hand before?
[2393.56 --> 2394.08]  Anyone?
[2395.98 --> 2396.84]  I wish you could
[2396.84 --> 2397.40]  See it better
[2397.40 --> 2400.86]  But it can be found
[2400.86 --> 2402.42]  In Michelangelo's
[2402.42 --> 2402.92]  Painting
[2402.92 --> 2403.94]  Of the creation
[2403.94 --> 2405.80]  Of humanity
[2405.80 --> 2407.20]  At the Sistine Chapel
[2407.20 --> 2408.24]  So here's that picture
[2408.24 --> 2410.48]  You see the similarities
[2410.48 --> 2411.92]  Between Matthew's hand
[2411.92 --> 2413.54]  As well as
[2413.54 --> 2414.66]  Jesus' hand
[2414.66 --> 2415.28]  And I've actually
[2415.28 --> 2416.10]  Put the two together
[2416.10 --> 2416.88]  So you can see them
[2416.88 --> 2417.46]  Compare them
[2417.46 --> 2418.06]  Next slide
[2418.06 --> 2418.84]  There you see
[2418.84 --> 2420.12]  The hands are identical
[2420.12 --> 2422.78]  The position of Jesus' hand
[2422.78 --> 2423.98]  In the Caravaggio painting
[2423.98 --> 2426.10]  Reflects the hand of Adam
[2426.10 --> 2427.54]  In the Sistine Chapel
[2427.54 --> 2429.18]  Thus Jesus is obviously
[2429.18 --> 2430.10]  The second Adam
[2430.10 --> 2431.70]  And I think Caravaggio
[2431.70 --> 2432.76]  Does this on purpose
[2432.76 --> 2434.30]  He wants us
[2434.30 --> 2435.48]  When we look at his painting
[2435.48 --> 2436.24]  To think about
[2436.24 --> 2437.52]  The Michelangelo painting
[2437.52 --> 2438.80]  Which by the way
[2438.80 --> 2439.42]  Caravaggio
[2439.42 --> 2440.48]  We know is Caravaggio
[2440.48 --> 2441.20]  But Caravaggio
[2441.20 --> 2441.94]  Is given name
[2441.94 --> 2443.10]  And his namesake
[2443.10 --> 2443.72]  Is actually
[2443.72 --> 2445.26]  Michelangelo
[2445.26 --> 2447.26]  Perhaps
[2447.26 --> 2448.68]  And this is my only
[2448.68 --> 2449.64]  Interpretation of it
[2449.64 --> 2451.52]  But is this not
[2451.52 --> 2452.16]  Another moment
[2452.16 --> 2452.76]  Of creation
[2452.76 --> 2454.34]  It's a creation
[2454.34 --> 2455.14]  Of a new life
[2455.14 --> 2456.06]  It's a creation
[2456.06 --> 2456.84]  Of a new man
[2456.84 --> 2457.70]  A new person
[2457.70 --> 2458.70]  A new disciple
[2458.70 --> 2461.02]  This is the transformation
[2461.02 --> 2461.94]  Of a Levi
[2461.94 --> 2463.50]  Once a tax collector
[2463.50 --> 2464.90]  To Matthew
[2464.90 --> 2466.52]  Now the disciple
[2466.52 --> 2469.14]  Great story
[2469.14 --> 2469.38]  Hey
[2469.38 --> 2471.22]  So what does Levi
[2471.22 --> 2471.54]  Do
[2471.54 --> 2472.76]  Surprise
[2472.76 --> 2474.10]  Like Simon
[2474.10 --> 2474.70]  Who becomes
[2474.70 --> 2475.74]  Peter before him
[2475.74 --> 2477.46]  Simon who drops
[2477.46 --> 2477.96]  Everything
[2477.96 --> 2478.72]  And follows him
[2478.72 --> 2479.24]  Who's given
[2479.24 --> 2479.92]  A new name
[2479.92 --> 2481.00]  Levi
[2481.00 --> 2482.38]  Now becomes
[2482.38 --> 2482.88]  Matthew
[2482.88 --> 2484.38]  Drops everything
[2484.38 --> 2485.50]  And responds
[2485.50 --> 2486.48]  To Jesus' call
[2486.48 --> 2487.36]  He begins
[2487.36 --> 2488.12]  To follow
[2488.12 --> 2489.20]  After Jesus
[2489.20 --> 2490.50]  But he doesn't
[2490.50 --> 2491.08]  Stop there
[2491.08 --> 2492.16]  And this is my
[2492.16 --> 2492.58]  Favorite part
[2492.58 --> 2493.08]  Of the story
[2493.08 --> 2493.96]  It's found
[2493.96 --> 2494.76]  In verse 29
[2494.76 --> 2496.38]  What's the first
[2496.38 --> 2497.02]  Thing that Levi
[2497.02 --> 2497.48]  Does
[2497.48 --> 2499.60]  He throws
[2499.60 --> 2500.32]  A banquet
[2500.32 --> 2500.92]  For Jesus
[2500.92 --> 2502.20]  And not only
[2502.20 --> 2502.54]  That
[2502.54 --> 2503.44]  He invites
[2503.44 --> 2504.76]  All his tax collector
[2504.76 --> 2505.68]  Friends to the banquet
[2505.68 --> 2506.02]  Too
[2506.02 --> 2507.08]  And if you think
[2507.08 --> 2507.64]  The Pharisees
[2507.64 --> 2508.08]  Are upset
[2508.08 --> 2508.52]  With Jesus
[2508.52 --> 2508.94]  Before
[2508.94 --> 2509.90]  They were really
[2509.90 --> 2510.58]  Really upset
[2510.58 --> 2510.88]  At him
[2510.88 --> 2511.32]  Now
[2511.32 --> 2512.58]  Because this man
[2512.58 --> 2513.56]  This man
[2513.56 --> 2514.68]  Eats and drinks
[2514.68 --> 2515.38]  With sinners
[2515.38 --> 2516.70]  And tax collectors
[2516.70 --> 2518.62]  They are incensed
[2518.62 --> 2520.24]  Why are they
[2520.24 --> 2520.68]  So upset
[2520.68 --> 2521.22]  At this
[2521.22 --> 2522.94]  Well let me explain
[2522.94 --> 2525.08]  Now in the Jewish culture
[2525.08 --> 2525.56]  And there's a lot
[2525.56 --> 2526.00]  Of cultures
[2526.00 --> 2527.10]  Eating is a big thing
[2527.10 --> 2529.06]  In my own ethnic culture
[2529.06 --> 2529.80]  I'm Chinese
[2529.80 --> 2530.90]  Eating is pretty much
[2530.90 --> 2532.10]  The biggest thing
[2532.10 --> 2533.24]  Anytime you have
[2533.24 --> 2533.90]  A birthday
[2533.90 --> 2534.66]  You eat
[2534.66 --> 2535.38]  Anniversary
[2535.38 --> 2535.88]  You eat
[2535.88 --> 2536.38]  Weddings
[2536.38 --> 2536.88]  You eat
[2536.88 --> 2537.36]  It's probably
[2537.36 --> 2538.22]  Similar to you
[2538.22 --> 2539.20]  But have you ever
[2539.20 --> 2539.84]  Noticed that
[2539.84 --> 2541.06]  Like on Christmas Eve
[2541.06 --> 2541.96]  The only restaurants
[2541.96 --> 2542.54]  Ever open
[2542.54 --> 2544.20]  Are Chinese ones
[2544.20 --> 2546.16]  Like it's true
[2546.16 --> 2547.16]  Like my Jewish friends
[2547.16 --> 2547.72]  I grew up
[2547.72 --> 2548.18]  Christmas
[2548.18 --> 2548.80]  Even though they
[2548.80 --> 2549.54]  Didn't celebrate it
[2549.54 --> 2550.40]  Was always synonymous
[2550.40 --> 2551.16]  With eating Chinese
[2551.16 --> 2551.46]  Food
[2551.46 --> 2551.88]  Because those
[2551.88 --> 2552.30]  Were the only
[2552.30 --> 2552.78]  Restaurants
[2552.78 --> 2553.40]  Ever open
[2553.40 --> 2555.42]  Eating is important
[2555.42 --> 2557.32]  And so is
[2557.32 --> 2558.66]  Who you ate with
[2558.66 --> 2560.88]  This dawned on me
[2560.88 --> 2561.30]  In a very
[2561.30 --> 2562.92]  Actually very meaningful
[2562.92 --> 2564.02]  Part of my life
[2564.02 --> 2565.78]  That I often went
[2565.78 --> 2566.60]  To these Chinese
[2566.60 --> 2567.82]  Banquets as a kid
[2567.82 --> 2569.42]  And I used to sit
[2569.42 --> 2569.98]  In the corner
[2569.98 --> 2571.38]  Way way over there
[2571.38 --> 2572.44]  With something called
[2572.44 --> 2573.80]  The kids table
[2573.80 --> 2574.90]  And I think you probably
[2574.90 --> 2576.22]  Have something similar
[2576.22 --> 2577.60]  You know what a kids table is
[2577.60 --> 2578.82]  That while the adults
[2578.82 --> 2580.02]  Are at the good banquet
[2580.02 --> 2580.46]  They're eating
[2580.46 --> 2581.54]  The good stuff
[2581.54 --> 2582.60]  So in my case
[2582.60 --> 2583.08]  They're eating
[2583.08 --> 2584.74]  Lobster with cream sauce
[2584.74 --> 2585.84]  And deep fried
[2585.84 --> 2587.40]  Crab and shrimp claws
[2587.40 --> 2588.60]  The good seafood
[2588.60 --> 2589.46]  The good stuff
[2589.46 --> 2591.70]  The kids are way over there
[2591.70 --> 2592.80]  At the kids table
[2592.80 --> 2594.08]  Eating sweet and sour
[2594.08 --> 2594.82]  Chicken balls
[2594.82 --> 2598.00]  But I remember
[2598.00 --> 2600.20]  Meaningful part of my life
[2600.20 --> 2601.08]  I think I was about
[2601.08 --> 2601.94]  12 or 13
[2601.94 --> 2603.30]  Kids table
[2603.30 --> 2604.04]  I went to a banquet
[2604.04 --> 2604.74]  Big banquet
[2604.74 --> 2606.20]  Kids table way over there
[2606.20 --> 2607.04]  I could see my brother
[2607.04 --> 2607.90]  He's way over there
[2607.90 --> 2608.64]  My sister
[2608.64 --> 2609.56]  I can't even see her
[2609.56 --> 2610.46]  She's so far away
[2610.46 --> 2613.18]  But where am I
[2613.18 --> 2616.38]  I'm over here
[2616.38 --> 2618.84]  I'm with the adults
[2618.84 --> 2621.12]  I'm eating the good stuff
[2621.12 --> 2622.68]  I'm entering
[2622.68 --> 2623.74]  Into the conversation
[2623.74 --> 2625.86]  And because it's a circular table
[2625.86 --> 2626.88]  In Chinese restaurants
[2626.88 --> 2628.70]  I'm not only equal to them
[2628.70 --> 2630.08]  I'm equal to the food
[2630.08 --> 2632.50]  I have arrived
[2632.50 --> 2634.48]  I am now considered
[2634.48 --> 2635.74]  One of them
[2635.74 --> 2636.96]  Do you follow?
[2638.06 --> 2639.46]  In the Middle Eastern culture
[2639.46 --> 2641.20]  Sharing a meal
[2641.20 --> 2642.50]  Is just the same
[2642.50 --> 2644.20]  But even more meaningful
[2644.20 --> 2645.24]  Welcoming someone
[2645.24 --> 2645.92]  To your table
[2645.92 --> 2648.04]  Is a sacramental act
[2648.04 --> 2649.72]  When a meal is shared
[2649.72 --> 2650.54]  You are considered
[2650.54 --> 2652.82]  Equals around the table
[2652.82 --> 2654.38]  Sharing a meal
[2654.38 --> 2656.10]  Means total acceptance
[2656.10 --> 2656.76]  Of each other
[2656.76 --> 2658.24]  That's why the Pharisees
[2658.24 --> 2659.34]  Found Jesus' behavior
[2659.34 --> 2660.48]  Quite scandalous
[2660.48 --> 2662.80]  This man eats with sinners
[2662.80 --> 2663.78]  And tax collectors
[2663.78 --> 2665.66]  He is eating with the unclean
[2665.66 --> 2667.54]  He accepts them as equals
[2667.54 --> 2668.64]  This rabbi
[2668.64 --> 2669.84]  Is eating with sinners
[2669.84 --> 2672.06]  He's not equal to them
[2672.06 --> 2674.02]  We are not the same as them
[2674.02 --> 2676.30]  That's why they're so mad
[2676.30 --> 2678.16]  Do you begin to see
[2678.16 --> 2679.10]  What's going on here?
[2680.30 --> 2681.48]  In choosing Levi then
[2681.48 --> 2683.98]  Jesus is making his mission
[2683.98 --> 2684.94]  Vividly clear
[2684.94 --> 2686.54]  He makes it clear
[2686.54 --> 2687.44]  That he has come
[2687.44 --> 2689.80]  Not to help those
[2689.80 --> 2691.36]  Like the Pharisees
[2691.36 --> 2692.92]  Who don't think they need him
[2692.92 --> 2695.64]  But to those who do need him
[2695.64 --> 2696.94]  In verse 31
[2696.94 --> 2697.52]  Jesus said
[2697.52 --> 2698.64]  It is not the healthy
[2698.64 --> 2699.62]  Who needs a doctor
[2699.62 --> 2700.88]  But the sick
[2700.88 --> 2702.18]  I have not come
[2702.18 --> 2703.28]  To call the righteous
[2703.28 --> 2705.28]  But sinners to repentance
[2705.28 --> 2707.16]  When you are well
[2707.16 --> 2707.88]  When you're healthy
[2707.88 --> 2708.46]  Feeling good
[2708.46 --> 2709.54]  The last person you want to see
[2709.54 --> 2711.22]  Is a doctor, right?
[2711.84 --> 2712.94]  You don't need a doctor
[2712.94 --> 2715.04]  But when you know you are sick
[2715.04 --> 2716.02]  When you know that
[2716.02 --> 2717.04]  You're not feeling very well
[2717.04 --> 2718.32]  You need to see a doctor
[2718.32 --> 2719.20]  Not just a doctor
[2719.20 --> 2720.16]  But you really want to see
[2720.16 --> 2720.90]  A good doctor
[2720.90 --> 2721.84]  A good doctor
[2721.84 --> 2722.84]  Who knows what they're doing
[2722.84 --> 2724.64]  That will do what they need to do
[2724.64 --> 2725.68]  That will provide healing
[2725.68 --> 2726.94]  And restoration to you
[2726.94 --> 2728.62]  In the same way
[2728.62 --> 2730.82]  Jesus comes to those
[2730.82 --> 2731.70]  Who knows
[2731.70 --> 2733.42]  That they are sick
[2733.42 --> 2734.68]  Sick with sin
[2734.68 --> 2735.26]  And greed
[2735.26 --> 2735.96]  And pride
[2735.96 --> 2736.58]  And anger
[2736.58 --> 2737.12]  And lust
[2737.12 --> 2738.38]  And he is a doctor
[2738.38 --> 2739.86]  He's a good doctor
[2739.86 --> 2741.08]  No, he's a really
[2741.08 --> 2742.12]  Really good doctor
[2742.12 --> 2743.22]  Who brings healing
[2743.22 --> 2744.12]  Of those things
[2744.12 --> 2745.20]  And who brings repentance
[2745.20 --> 2746.08]  And salvation
[2746.08 --> 2746.78]  And restoration
[2746.78 --> 2749.74]  Are you healthy or sick?
[2750.68 --> 2751.62]  Are you righteous
[2751.62 --> 2752.88]  Or a sinner?
[2753.86 --> 2755.54]  Because Jesus makes it very clear
[2755.54 --> 2756.92]  That he has not come to heal
[2756.92 --> 2757.62]  The righteous
[2757.62 --> 2759.02]  Or the self-righteous
[2759.02 --> 2760.40]  Because I think that's what he means here
[2760.40 --> 2762.48]  He has not come to heal
[2762.48 --> 2763.48]  The self-righteous
[2763.48 --> 2765.32]  Because the self-righteous
[2765.32 --> 2766.42]  Don't realize
[2766.42 --> 2768.94]  That they actually need him
[2768.94 --> 2771.24]  No, Jesus comes to those
[2771.24 --> 2773.16]  Who know they need Jesus
[2773.16 --> 2774.14]  In their lives
[2774.14 --> 2776.00]  You know, one of the ways
[2776.00 --> 2777.36]  I think we can discover
[2777.36 --> 2779.40]  Whether we truly understand
[2779.40 --> 2779.98]  The gospel
[2779.98 --> 2782.10]  Is how we use the word sinner
[2782.10 --> 2784.08]  Because self-righteous
[2784.08 --> 2785.00]  Religious people
[2785.00 --> 2786.34]  Will always use sinner
[2786.34 --> 2787.12]  Like this
[2787.12 --> 2789.46]  That man eats with them
[2789.46 --> 2790.90]  Those sinners
[2790.90 --> 2792.28]  And tax collectors
[2792.28 --> 2794.18]  They divide the world
[2794.18 --> 2795.16]  Into two groups
[2795.16 --> 2796.42]  Them and us
[2796.42 --> 2797.78]  They demand
[2797.78 --> 2799.28]  That those sinners
[2799.28 --> 2800.08]  Measure up
[2800.08 --> 2802.00]  Because they think
[2802.00 --> 2802.94]  That they've arrived
[2802.94 --> 2804.34]  And earned their salvation
[2804.34 --> 2805.58]  The self-righteous do
[2805.58 --> 2807.60]  Are you a sinner
[2807.60 --> 2807.62]  Are you a sinner
[2807.62 --> 2808.74]  Are you a righteous
[2808.74 --> 2810.72]  Because if we're honest
[2810.72 --> 2811.32]  With ourselves
[2811.32 --> 2812.40]  We have to admit
[2812.40 --> 2814.40]  Friends, we are not
[2814.40 --> 2816.08]  A church of saints
[2816.08 --> 2818.66]  We are first and foremost
[2818.66 --> 2820.26]  A church of sinners
[2820.26 --> 2822.68]  Who need healing
[2822.68 --> 2824.28]  Who need Jesus
[2824.28 --> 2825.46]  In our lives
[2825.46 --> 2827.70]  There is no us and them
[2827.70 --> 2829.50]  Because we are all
[2829.50 --> 2830.48]  The same
[2830.48 --> 2832.18]  In desperate need
[2832.18 --> 2833.30]  Of Jesus
[2833.30 --> 2835.72]  Jesus, thankfully
[2835.72 --> 2838.04]  Jesus uses the word sinner
[2838.04 --> 2839.56]  In an entirely different way
[2839.56 --> 2841.18]  He doesn't use the word
[2841.18 --> 2841.74]  To judge us
[2841.74 --> 2842.68]  Or look down on us
[2842.68 --> 2844.22]  Instead he uses it
[2844.22 --> 2845.58]  To sweeten our lives
[2845.58 --> 2847.18]  I have not come
[2847.18 --> 2848.48]  To call the self-righteous
[2848.48 --> 2849.60]  But I have come
[2849.60 --> 2850.84]  To call sinners
[2850.84 --> 2852.02]  To repentance
[2852.02 --> 2853.46]  Did you hear that?
[2853.48 --> 2854.82]  He comes to call us
[2854.82 --> 2855.50]  To repentance
[2855.50 --> 2856.96]  To Simon
[2856.96 --> 2857.56]  To Levi
[2857.56 --> 2858.10]  To you
[2858.10 --> 2858.62]  To me
[2858.62 --> 2860.18]  To each and every one of us
[2860.18 --> 2861.54]  We are all sinners
[2861.54 --> 2863.22]  In need of Jesus
[2863.22 --> 2865.00]  Now when I hear
[2865.00 --> 2865.70]  The word sinner
[2865.70 --> 2867.78]  I hear a call of life
[2867.78 --> 2868.98]  Of salvation
[2868.98 --> 2869.94]  Of healing
[2869.94 --> 2870.82]  Of acceptance
[2870.82 --> 2872.24]  And grace
[2872.24 --> 2874.82]  So let me put
[2874.82 --> 2875.56]  All of this together
[2875.56 --> 2877.56]  Jesus calls Levi
[2877.56 --> 2878.36]  To follow him
[2878.36 --> 2879.80]  And what does Levi do?
[2880.62 --> 2881.52]  Like Simon Peter
[2881.52 --> 2882.16]  Before him
[2882.16 --> 2883.84]  He drops everything
[2883.84 --> 2884.60]  And responds
[2884.60 --> 2885.50]  To Jesus' call
[2885.50 --> 2886.76]  He follows hard
[2886.76 --> 2887.80]  After Jesus
[2887.80 --> 2889.50]  But he doesn't stop there
[2889.50 --> 2890.62]  What's the first thing he does?
[2890.68 --> 2891.40]  He throws a banquet
[2891.40 --> 2893.14]  For Jesus
[2893.14 --> 2893.76]  And he invites
[2893.76 --> 2895.62]  All his tax collector friends
[2895.62 --> 2896.80]  To the banquet as well
[2896.80 --> 2897.26]  Why?
[2898.38 --> 2899.10]  Well because I think
[2899.10 --> 2899.92]  He wants his friends
[2899.92 --> 2901.22]  To know this Jesus too
[2901.22 --> 2903.06]  Just like Simon Peter
[2903.06 --> 2904.08]  He too begins
[2904.08 --> 2905.18]  To fish for people
[2905.18 --> 2906.60]  He too seeks
[2906.60 --> 2907.32]  To bring people
[2907.32 --> 2908.20]  Into the loving
[2908.20 --> 2908.98]  And merciful net
[2908.98 --> 2909.98]  Of God's love
[2909.98 --> 2911.60]  Because true repentance
[2911.60 --> 2912.38]  And salvation
[2912.38 --> 2913.90]  Is not only a personal thing
[2913.90 --> 2914.76]  It's not only
[2914.76 --> 2915.76]  An individual thing
[2915.76 --> 2917.84]  Salvation is a social thing
[2917.84 --> 2919.20]  Salvation changes
[2919.20 --> 2920.38]  The way we see people
[2920.38 --> 2921.40]  And understand them
[2921.40 --> 2923.22]  We begin to see people
[2923.22 --> 2924.30]  Who need Jesus
[2924.30 --> 2925.74]  We begin to see people
[2925.74 --> 2926.84]  Who need justice
[2926.84 --> 2928.28]  We begin to see people
[2928.28 --> 2929.36]  Who experience
[2929.36 --> 2931.44]  Who we want to experience
[2931.44 --> 2932.20]  The love of God
[2932.20 --> 2933.04]  Just as us
[2933.04 --> 2935.20]  And we see people
[2935.20 --> 2936.42]  That we can invite
[2936.42 --> 2937.84]  To our tables
[2937.84 --> 2940.32]  Tim Chester has this great quote
[2940.32 --> 2941.94]  And it's on the screen
[2941.94 --> 2944.34]  Meals slow us down
[2944.34 --> 2946.22]  Some of us don't like that
[2946.22 --> 2947.92]  We like to get things done
[2947.92 --> 2950.40]  But meals force us
[2950.40 --> 2952.00]  To be people orientated
[2952.00 --> 2954.38]  Instead of task orientated
[2954.38 --> 2955.88]  Sharing a meal
[2955.88 --> 2957.40]  Is not the only way
[2957.40 --> 2958.34]  To build a relationship
[2958.34 --> 2960.20]  But it's number one
[2960.20 --> 2960.72]  On the list
[2960.72 --> 2962.40]  Followed by this other
[2962.40 --> 2963.06]  Great quote
[2963.06 --> 2965.56]  Jesus' mission strategy
[2965.56 --> 2967.92]  Was a long meal
[2967.92 --> 2969.66]  So friends
[2969.66 --> 2970.38]  It's the summer
[2970.38 --> 2971.90]  We began talking
[2971.90 --> 2972.42]  About eating
[2972.42 --> 2974.86]  Who do you eat with?
[2974.86 --> 2976.74]  Who do you welcome
[2976.74 --> 2977.48]  Into your home?
[2978.36 --> 2979.20]  Who do you invite
[2979.20 --> 2979.60]  To dinner?
[2979.74 --> 2980.56]  Who do you accept
[2980.56 --> 2981.22]  As equals?
[2982.58 --> 2983.60]  There is something
[2983.60 --> 2984.84]  About sharing a meal
[2984.84 --> 2985.82]  Together isn't there?
[2986.56 --> 2987.42]  Today we learned
[2987.42 --> 2988.12]  About how Jesus
[2988.12 --> 2988.92]  Eats with Levi
[2988.92 --> 2989.74]  And all his friends
[2989.74 --> 2990.72]  How he desired
[2990.72 --> 2991.66]  To enter into
[2991.66 --> 2992.76]  Relationship with him
[2992.76 --> 2993.82]  This is a story
[2993.82 --> 2994.94]  Actually about acceptance
[2994.94 --> 2995.78]  And equality
[2995.78 --> 2996.96]  And it is demonstrated
[2996.96 --> 2997.66]  And played out
[2997.66 --> 2998.54]  Through hospitality
[2998.54 --> 3000.60]  So again
[3000.60 --> 3001.74]  Who do you eat with?
[3002.68 --> 3003.68]  Maybe it's that person
[3003.68 --> 3004.60]  Who's sitting right next
[3004.60 --> 3004.94]  To you
[3004.94 --> 3006.04]  This past year
[3006.04 --> 3006.58]  At the church
[3006.58 --> 3008.30]  You could invite them
[3008.30 --> 3009.10]  For lunch today
[3009.10 --> 3011.08]  Or that newish person
[3011.08 --> 3011.74]  Sitting around
[3011.74 --> 3013.74]  Or your co-worker
[3013.74 --> 3014.70]  Or classmate
[3014.70 --> 3016.06]  Or your neighbor
[3016.06 --> 3018.88]  My hope and my prayer
[3018.88 --> 3020.60]  Is that we would be
[3020.60 --> 3021.12]  A church
[3021.12 --> 3022.60]  Who would be guided
[3022.60 --> 3023.52]  By the Holy Spirit
[3023.52 --> 3024.96]  To go to new places
[3024.96 --> 3026.74]  To meet new people
[3026.74 --> 3028.38]  And to simply
[3028.38 --> 3030.46]  Share a meal together
[3030.46 --> 3032.50]  That's the easiest
[3032.50 --> 3033.74]  Mission strategy
[3033.74 --> 3034.64]  You can think of
[3034.64 --> 3035.82]  And it's the one
[3035.82 --> 3036.62]  Jesus used
[3036.62 --> 3039.48]  Simply to invite others
[3039.48 --> 3041.04]  To our tables
[3041.04 --> 3042.90]  So who is it
[3042.90 --> 3044.70]  That God is calling you
[3044.70 --> 3045.40]  To meet with
[3045.40 --> 3046.84]  To eat with
[3046.84 --> 3049.32]  And to simply love?
[3050.40 --> 3051.24]  Last thing
[3051.24 --> 3053.00]  Back to the painting
[3053.00 --> 3054.60]  Next slide
[3054.60 --> 3056.46]  Caravaggio does something
[3056.46 --> 3057.58]  Really really interesting here
[3057.58 --> 3058.36]  And I wish you could
[3058.36 --> 3058.94]  See it better
[3058.94 --> 3060.36]  But if you were to
[3060.36 --> 3061.94]  Closely look at Jesus
[3061.94 --> 3063.00]  You would note
[3063.00 --> 3063.68]  That something's
[3063.68 --> 3064.42]  Really weird
[3064.42 --> 3065.70]  That as Jesus
[3065.70 --> 3067.02]  Is coming into
[3067.02 --> 3068.24]  The room
[3068.24 --> 3069.90]  He's pointing to Levi
[3069.90 --> 3071.46]  But his feet
[3071.46 --> 3072.32]  And I wish you could
[3072.32 --> 3072.76]  See them
[3072.76 --> 3073.98]  His feet are pointed
[3073.98 --> 3074.62]  The other way
[3074.62 --> 3075.44]  Towards the door
[3075.44 --> 3076.98]  So it's like this
[3076.98 --> 3078.82]  So I put the next picture
[3078.82 --> 3079.84]  You can kind of
[3079.84 --> 3080.04]  Yeah
[3080.04 --> 3081.58]  You can't really see his feet
[3081.58 --> 3082.40]  You'll have to google it
[3082.40 --> 3083.02]  But trust me
[3083.02 --> 3084.34]  And it seems weird
[3084.34 --> 3085.10]  Like why is Jesus
[3085.10 --> 3085.86]  Pointing this way
[3085.86 --> 3087.16]  But his feet are that way
[3087.16 --> 3088.34]  Like what's going on?
[3089.46 --> 3090.28]  I think his feet
[3090.28 --> 3090.84]  Are this way
[3090.84 --> 3091.32]  And I think what
[3091.32 --> 3093.02]  Caravaggio is doing
[3093.02 --> 3094.90]  Is because he wants
[3094.90 --> 3095.46]  To depict
[3095.46 --> 3097.24]  That Jesus is heading
[3097.24 --> 3098.12]  Out the door already
[3098.12 --> 3100.74]  Because Jesus is on the move
[3100.74 --> 3102.52]  He's going places
[3102.52 --> 3104.18]  His feet are off
[3104.18 --> 3105.92]  To find yet another disciple
[3105.92 --> 3106.98]  He's off to share
[3106.98 --> 3108.30]  Another meal with someone
[3108.30 --> 3109.12]  Else
[3109.12 --> 3111.04]  So Jesus is coming
[3111.04 --> 3111.92]  To us today
[3111.92 --> 3112.94]  And says follow me
[3112.94 --> 3113.68]  And he's heading
[3113.68 --> 3114.32]  Out the door
[3114.32 --> 3117.00]  Because there's other
[3117.00 --> 3118.06]  Disciples he wants
[3118.06 --> 3118.68]  To join
[3118.68 --> 3121.36]  Will we follow him?
[3122.96 --> 3124.10]  Will we follow
[3124.10 --> 3125.22]  After Jesus
[3125.22 --> 3125.92]  Hard
[3125.92 --> 3127.90]  Doing what he did
[3127.90 --> 3129.58]  Sharing meals
[3129.58 --> 3130.82]  Loving other people
[3130.82 --> 3132.84]  Will we follow
[3132.84 --> 3133.78]  Hard
[3133.78 --> 3135.06]  After our
[3135.06 --> 3135.46]  Rabbi
[3135.46 --> 3136.30]  Jesus
[3136.30 --> 3138.40]  So friends
[3138.40 --> 3139.76]  Don't dawdle
[3139.76 --> 3141.22]  Don't sit around
[3141.22 --> 3143.62]  Jesus is on the move
[3143.62 --> 3145.72]  So let's follow
[3145.72 --> 3146.74]  After
[3146.74 --> 3148.10]  Jesus
[3148.10 --> 3148.70]  Indeed
[3148.70 --> 3151.12]  Amen
[3151.12 --> 3153.04]  Let's pray
[3153.04 --> 3155.20]  Father God
[3155.20 --> 3156.60]  What a great story
[3156.60 --> 3157.32]  And a reminder
[3157.32 --> 3159.40]  That to follow you
[3159.40 --> 3161.78]  Means to follow Jesus
[3161.78 --> 3163.44]  And how he lived his life
[3163.44 --> 3165.14]  Loving others
[3165.14 --> 3166.88]  Accepting people
[3166.88 --> 3167.66]  Into his life
[3167.66 --> 3168.34]  And simply
[3168.34 --> 3170.40]  By doing normal things
[3170.40 --> 3172.44]  Like sharing a meal
[3172.44 --> 3176.38]  God you have convicted me
[3176.38 --> 3177.38]  This last year
[3177.38 --> 3178.94]  That
[3178.94 --> 3180.74]  Just to invite a neighbor over
[3180.74 --> 3182.64]  Friends we haven't seen
[3182.64 --> 3185.32]  Begins to build relationship
[3185.32 --> 3188.16]  Hospitality
[3188.16 --> 3188.88]  And welcome
[3188.88 --> 3191.14]  And I pray that
[3191.14 --> 3192.36]  We would be
[3192.36 --> 3193.10]  People
[3193.10 --> 3195.20]  That follow after you
[3195.20 --> 3197.08]  That begin to make disciples
[3197.08 --> 3199.12]  One meal
[3199.12 --> 3200.52]  At a time
[3200.52 --> 3202.46]  So come
[3202.46 --> 3202.76]  Spirit
[3202.76 --> 3203.16]  Come
[3203.16 --> 3204.54]  And even now
[3204.54 --> 3205.44]  Begin to move us
[3205.44 --> 3206.84]  As who you might be calling
[3206.84 --> 3208.08]  Into our lives
[3208.08 --> 3209.76]  That we can simply
[3209.76 --> 3211.14]  Open our homes
[3211.14 --> 3212.90]  And share a meal
[3212.90 --> 3216.00]  In Christ's name I pray
[3216.00 --> 3217.28]  Amen
[3217.28 --> 3237.86]  Let's stand and sing together
[3237.86 --> 3255.74]  Will you come and follow me
[3255.74 --> 3260.18]  If I but call your name
[3260.18 --> 3263.66]  Will you go where you don't know
[3263.66 --> 3267.88]  And never be the same
[3267.88 --> 3271.58]  Will you let my love be shown
[3271.58 --> 3276.10]  Will you let my name be known
[3276.10 --> 3279.58]  Will you let my life be grown
[3279.58 --> 3283.66]  In you and you in me
[3283.66 --> 3289.50]  Will you love the you you hide
[3289.50 --> 3293.66]  If I but call your name
[3293.66 --> 3297.06]  Will you quell the fear inside
[3297.06 --> 3301.36]  And never be the same
[3301.36 --> 3305.56]  Will you use the faith you found
[3305.56 --> 3309.42]  To reshape the world around
[3309.42 --> 3313.28]  Through my sight and touch and sound
[3313.28 --> 3317.44]  In you and you in me
[3317.44 --> 3323.44]  Lord your summons echoes true
[3323.44 --> 3327.78]  When you but call my name
[3327.78 --> 3331.22]  Let me turn and follow you
[3331.22 --> 3335.58]  And never be the same
[3335.58 --> 3339.28]  In your company I'll go
[3339.28 --> 3343.98]  Where your love and footsteps show
[3343.98 --> 3347.76]  Thus I'll move and live and grow
[3347.76 --> 3352.56]  In you and you in me
[3352.56 --> 3377.04]  Worship spills into every part of our lives
[3377.04 --> 3378.02]  As we heard this morning
[3378.02 --> 3381.30]  And part of our worship today as well
[3381.30 --> 3384.52]  Is offering to God
[3384.52 --> 3386.00]  What he has given us
[3386.00 --> 3387.96]  And today's offering
[3387.96 --> 3389.52]  Is for Arosha
[3389.52 --> 3392.90]  A organization of stewardship
[3392.90 --> 3395.36]  That helps to bring sustainable food solutions
[3395.36 --> 3396.32]  To those struggling
[3396.32 --> 3398.36]  With obtaining food for themselves
[3398.36 --> 3400.54]  And their families across Canada
[3400.54 --> 3403.08]  Education is a large part of their work
[3403.08 --> 3404.46]  And if you ever get the chance
[3404.46 --> 3405.80]  You could find out more
[3405.80 --> 3406.98]  By visiting Arosha
[3406.98 --> 3409.54]  Arosha's property in Surrey
[3409.54 --> 3411.32]  Or even volunteering
[3411.32 --> 3412.46]  In their garden
[3412.46 --> 3414.90]  You can find out more online
[3414.90 --> 3417.50]  May God bless us as we give
[3417.50 --> 3433.64] ton проблемы hosting and
[3433.64 --> 3435.80]  лежit in the land of Ontario
[3435.80 --> 3436.80]  Amen.
[3465.80 --> 3467.80]  Amen.
[3495.80 --> 3521.00]  Let's pray together.
[3521.00 --> 3550.98]  Amen.
[3551.00 --> 3552.00]  Amen.
[3552.00 --> 3582.00] 
[3582.00 --> 3612.00] 
[3612.00 --> 3642.00] 
[3642.00 --> 3643.00] 
[3672.00 --> 3674.14]  Great physician, heal him, we pray.
[3675.16 --> 3678.46]  Will you give strength and faith to his parents and grandparents?
[3679.56 --> 3684.66]  May they look to you as their rock in the shifting sands of uncertainty and fear.
[3684.66 --> 3693.00]  May we pray, too, for our shut-in and elderly who struggle with so many losses, mental capacity,
[3693.00 --> 3697.00]  physical weakness, independence.
[3697.00 --> 3701.28]  May we remember them not only in prayer but in phone calls and visits.
[3701.28 --> 3706.50]  May they have compassionate caregivers who bring light into their lives.
[3706.50 --> 3710.86]  Thank you for people who care for the sick, disabled, and elderly.
[3710.86 --> 3716.28]  We pray for a renewal of our health care system that seems to be weakening daily.
[3716.28 --> 3723.84]  Finally, in our last week before basic skills, we ask that the life-saving gospel may touch
[3723.84 --> 3728.92]  the lives of the children who attend, as well as everyone involved.
[3728.92 --> 3734.12]  May we have a good time together celebrating the gifts you give us, and mostly the gift
[3734.12 --> 3735.12]  of abundant life in you.
[3735.12 --> 3743.52]  May we have a good time to thank you for the new life that you have given to the Burans.
[3743.52 --> 3749.36]  And we just pray that you will be with them as parents and with all new parents, that they
[3749.36 --> 3755.00]  may raise their children in fear and love of you.
[3755.00 --> 3762.20]  When all are asking, Lord, we ask you for so many gifts of healing in various stages.
[3762.20 --> 3767.56]  Even when healing doesn't come quickly or completely, you walk with us and provide grace in time
[3767.56 --> 3769.08]  of need.
[3769.08 --> 3772.62]  You are doing great things for and in us.
[3772.62 --> 3778.20]  We praise and thank you, laying before you everything in the name of Jesus, the name above
[3778.20 --> 3779.20]  all names.
[3779.20 --> 3780.20]  Amen.
[3785.00 --> 3803.28]  May the road rise to meet you.
[3803.28 --> 3806.78]  May the wind always be at your back.
[3806.78 --> 3809.84]  The sun shine warm upon your face.
[3809.84 --> 3813.38]  The rains fall softly upon your fields.
[3813.38 --> 3820.22]  And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his hand.
[3820.22 --> 3821.22]  Amen.
[3821.22 --> 3825.22]  Will you please remain standing as we close with a closing song.
[3843.38 --> 3863.34]  Beautiful Savior, King of creation, Son of God and Son of Man.
[3863.34 --> 3872.34]  Truly I love Thee, truly I serve Thee.
[3872.34 --> 3881.78]  Light of my soul, my joy, my crown.
[3883.88 --> 3892.28]  Fair is the sunshine, fair is the sunlight.
[3892.28 --> 3901.28]  Bright the sparkling stars on high.
[3901.28 --> 3906.28]  Jesus shines brighter.
[3907.52 --> 3911.28]  Jesus shines purer.
[3911.28 --> 3920.72]  Than all the angels in the sky.
[3920.72 --> 3931.72]  Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations.
[3931.72 --> 3941.72]  Son of God and Son of Man.
[3941.72 --> 3951.72]  Glory and honor, praise and adoration.
[3951.72 --> 3960.72]  Now and forevermore behind.
[3960.72 --> 3961.72]  Loyal Señor.
[3961.72 --> 3970.16]  thou wishest of Lord oh my most certain of you are in the sido of the most supernatural of the sewers,
[3970.16 --> 3971.92]  all the angels in the altars.
[3971.92 --> 3975.10]  Whoング, and the angels as the Firstly to the Anakin of the Jonasuff늘,
[3975.10 --> 3976.98]  the Lord of the nations.
[3976.98 --> 3977.56]  Of the signs and which they see the Israelites.
[3977.56 --> 3981.98]  In the darkness, there's a room that will shed between the Forgive and the requests from your guests.
[3981.98 --> 3983.98]  Amen.
[4011.98 --> 4013.98]  Amen.
[4041.98 --> 4043.98]  Amen.
