[320.60 --> 322.60]  Good morning.
[322.60 --> 326.60]  So to all of you who are here in person and to all of you who are here in person,
[326.60 --> 328.60]  and to all of you who are online,
[328.60 --> 335.60]  we're very excited that we are gathered and the Lord has called us to gather to worship him together this morning.
[335.60 --> 336.60]  I'm Jason Truel.
[336.60 --> 339.60]  I'm the lead pastor here at Latinx Christian Reformed Church.
[339.60 --> 343.60]  And we are here to worship the Lord this morning.
[343.60 --> 347.60]  But before we do that, there are just a few announcements.
[347.60 --> 354.60]  First, our designated offering this morning is for the Umran family.
[354.60 --> 359.60]  And they are missionaries serving in Egypt among Muslim people.
[359.60 --> 364.60]  And so we are long-time supporters of these missionaries.
[364.60 --> 367.60]  And so our designated offering is for them today.
[367.60 --> 371.60]  And we are not collecting an offering in the course of our service,
[371.60 --> 375.60]  but you can use the drop boxes by the doors or give online.
[375.60 --> 380.60]  So I believe hospital singing is next Sunday.
[380.60 --> 381.60]  No.
[381.60 --> 382.60]  No.
[382.60 --> 383.60]  Okay. Never mind about that.
[383.60 --> 385.60]  There's still some uncertainty around COVID for that.
[385.60 --> 386.60]  So.
[386.60 --> 390.60]  But another announcement is we've been announcing over the last few weeks
[390.60 --> 393.60]  that we have these new groups that will be starting very soon,
[393.60 --> 395.60]  called listening circles.
[395.60 --> 402.60]  And these are an opportunity to read together the Human Sexuality Report,
[402.60 --> 404.60]  which will be coming before Synod this summer,
[404.60 --> 408.60]  and to respond to it together.
[408.60 --> 410.60]  So this would be like the last Sunday to sign up.
[410.60 --> 413.60]  We've had already a lot of people sign up.
[413.60 --> 414.60]  So this is the last chance.
[414.60 --> 415.60]  So do that.
[415.60 --> 425.60]  And then we will be in touch with you to schedule maybe a best time for most people to have these groups.
[425.60 --> 431.60]  So let's prepare our hearts now to worship the Lord.
[431.60 --> 436.60]  Our call to worship this morning comes from a few selections of the Psalms.
[436.60 --> 441.60]  And so where it's bolded and where there's the double arrow, I'll invite you to read it with me.
[441.60 --> 447.60]  Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[447.60 --> 451.60]  You have set your glory in the heavens.
[451.60 --> 454.60]  Through the praise of children and infants,
[454.60 --> 459.60]  you have established a stronghold against your enemies.
[460.60 --> 462.60]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[462.60 --> 465.60]  Let us exalt his name together.
[465.60 --> 469.60]  I sought the Lord and he answered me.
[469.60 --> 473.60]  He delivered me from all my fears.
[473.60 --> 478.60]  Let the name of the Lord be praised both now and forevermore.
[478.60 --> 482.60]  From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets,
[482.60 --> 486.60]  the name of the Lord is to be praised.
[486.60 --> 489.60]  Let's come before the Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[489.60 --> 491.60]  And before I lead us in prayer,
[491.60 --> 495.60]  just give you a moment to prepare your hearts to come before the Lord.
[495.60 --> 496.60]  Let us pray.
[496.60 --> 497.60]  Let us pray.
[497.60 --> 498.60]  Let us pray.
[498.60 --> 499.60]  Let us pray.
[499.60 --> 500.60]  Let us pray.
[500.60 --> 501.60]  Let us pray.
[501.60 --> 503.60]  Let us pray.
[503.60 --> 505.60]  Let us pray.
[505.60 --> 510.60]  Our one true and living God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[510.60 --> 516.60]  we come before you this morning joining our voices with all of creation,
[516.60 --> 521.60]  with young and old, those in the east and the west,
[521.60 --> 526.60]  those of old who worshipped you, of your people Israel,
[526.60 --> 529.60]  and in us today who worship you.
[529.60 --> 534.60]  Lord, we join all of our voices and also with those in your throne room
[534.60 --> 536.60]  to bring you jubilant praise.
[536.60 --> 541.60]  As we worship you this morning, Lord, would you reveal to us your goodness,
[541.60 --> 544.60]  your might, and your love.
[544.60 --> 548.60]  Let everything that has breath praise your holy name this morning.
[548.60 --> 550.60]  In Christ's name we pray.
[550.60 --> 551.60]  Amen.
[551.60 --> 555.60]  And so would you rise in body or spirit as you are able.
[555.60 --> 559.60]  Our Lord has called us to worship and now greets us with these words.
[559.60 --> 566.60]  The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and rich in love.
[566.60 --> 571.60]  Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[571.60 --> 575.60]  And as the Lord has called us, he's gathered us,
[575.60 --> 580.60]  let us now turn and greet one another in that name, the name of the Lord.
[580.60 --> 590.00]  Who needs an
[590.60 --> 592.60]  of God.
[592.60 --> 596.60]  God, God, God, God.
[596.60 --> 599.60]  The kingdom of God.
[599.60 --> 603.40]  The kingdom of God power, heal him and rear member,
[603.60 --> 608.60]  his name revelation and cardiac education.
[608.60 --> 625.80]  I saw the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear.
[625.80 --> 640.50]  Those who look on him are radiant, they'll never be ashamed, they'll never be ashamed.
[640.50 --> 655.00]  This poor man cried and the Lord heard me and saved me from my enemies.
[655.80 --> 671.18]  The Son of God surrounds his saints, he will deliver them, he will deliver them.
[671.18 --> 678.18]  Magnify the Lord with me.
[679.72 --> 686.18]  Come exalt his name together.
[686.18 --> 693.18]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[694.72 --> 701.18]  Come exalt his name forever.
[701.18 --> 709.48]  Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[709.48 --> 716.48]  Oh, blessed is he who hides in him.
[716.48 --> 720.48]  Oh, fear the Lord.
[720.48 --> 724.48]  Oh, all you saints.
[724.48 --> 727.48]  He'll give you everything.
[727.48 --> 731.48]  He'll give you everything.
[731.48 --> 738.48]  Magnify the Lord with me.
[738.48 --> 746.48]  Come exalt his name together.
[746.48 --> 753.48]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[753.48 --> 761.48]  Come exalt his name forever.
[761.48 --> 776.48]  Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[776.48 --> 781.48]  Never-ending praise.
[781.48 --> 784.48]  May our incense rise.
[784.48 --> 791.48]  Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[791.48 --> 795.48]  Never-ending praise.
[795.48 --> 796.48]  May our incense rise.
[796.48 --> 798.48]  May our incense rise.
[798.48 --> 802.48]  Magnify the Lord with me.
[802.48 --> 804.48]  Come exalt his name together.
[804.48 --> 806.48]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[806.48 --> 810.48]  Come exalt his name together.
[810.48 --> 811.48]  Together.
[811.48 --> 820.48]  Glorify the Lord with me.
[820.48 --> 825.48]  Come exalt his name forever.
[825.48 --> 830.48]  Come exalt his name forever.
[830.48 --> 835.48]  We are hardly bronzed� with me are석 Amen
[835.48 --> 855.48]  So Adam at神 every day and night
[855.48 --> 857.48]  expenditures the Lord crowns
[857.48 --> 859.48]  compulsory promenzia
[859.48 --> 863.30]  All music but in song.
[863.94 --> 867.88]  Awake my soul and sing.
[868.24 --> 871.96]  Of him who died for thee.
[871.96 --> 876.64]  And hail him as thine match his king.
[876.94 --> 879.72]  Through all eternity.
[881.92 --> 885.46]  Round him the Lord of life.
[885.74 --> 888.96]  Who triumphed o'er the grave.
[890.00 --> 894.20]  Who rose victorious in the strife.
[894.42 --> 898.14]  On those he came to save.
[898.14 --> 902.52]  His glories now we sing.
[902.98 --> 906.86]  Who died and reigns on high.
[907.20 --> 911.38]  Who died eternal life to bring.
[911.66 --> 915.54]  And lives that death may die.
[915.54 --> 920.26]  Round him the Lord of love.
[920.76 --> 924.20]  Behold his hands and sigh.
[924.20 --> 929.14]  His wounds yet visible above.
[929.36 --> 933.20]  In beauty glorified.
[933.72 --> 937.60]  All hail, Redeemer, hail.
[938.16 --> 942.02]  For thou hast died for me.
[942.54 --> 946.92]  Thy praise shall never, never fail.
[946.92 --> 962.32]  Through
[962.32 --> 980.28]  In our days that God has numbered, I was made to walk with Him.
[980.28 --> 989.38]  Yet I look for worldly treasure and forsake the King of kings.
[989.38 --> 998.88]  But mine is hope in my Redeemer, though I fall, His love is sure.
[998.88 --> 1008.30]  For Christ has paid for every failing, I am missed forevermore.
[1008.30 --> 1026.30]  Mine are tears in times of sorrow, darkness not yet understood.
[1026.30 --> 1035.30]  Through the valley I must travel, where I see no earthly good.
[1035.30 --> 1045.30]  But mine is peace that flows from heaven, and the strength in times of me.
[1045.30 --> 1056.30]  I know my pain will not be wasted, Christ completes His work in me.
[1056.30 --> 1066.30]  U.S.
[1066.30 --> 1068.84]  here as a stranger
[1068.84 --> 1070.12]  we'll run
[1070.12 --> 1072.00]  on their
[1072.00 --> 1074.16]  way. One
[1074.16 --> 1076.02]  with Christ I
[1076.02 --> 1077.90]  will encounter
[1077.90 --> 1079.94]  our metriarch
[1079.94 --> 1082.24]  for his name.
[1082.66 --> 1083.88]  But mine is
[1083.88 --> 1086.12]  armor for this
[1086.12 --> 1088.12]  battle, strong
[1088.12 --> 1090.40]  enough to last
[1090.40 --> 1091.58]  the war.
[1091.58 --> 1093.90]  And he has said
[1093.90 --> 1095.58]  he will deliver
[1095.58 --> 1098.40]  safely to
[1098.40 --> 1100.80]  the golden shore.
[1101.26 --> 1102.38]  And mine are
[1102.38 --> 1104.40]  keys to Zion
[1104.40 --> 1106.52]  City, where
[1106.52 --> 1108.36]  beside the
[1108.36 --> 1110.02]  King I walk.
[1110.44 --> 1112.26]  For there my heart
[1112.26 --> 1114.66]  has found his treasure.
[1115.22 --> 1116.88]  Christ is mine
[1116.88 --> 1119.04]  forevermore.
[1125.58 --> 1134.48]  Christ is mine
[1134.48 --> 1137.40]  Come
[1137.40 --> 1140.88]  rejoice now, O my
[1140.88 --> 1142.76]  soul, Lord
[1142.76 --> 1145.08]  his love is my
[1145.08 --> 1147.70]  reward. Fear is
[1147.70 --> 1149.54]  gone and hope
[1149.54 --> 1152.16]  is sure. Christ is
[1152.16 --> 1155.34]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1155.82 --> 1159.94]  Come rejoice now, O my soul,
[1160.24 --> 1164.18]  for his love is my reward.
[1164.98 --> 1168.98]  Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[1169.54 --> 1173.34]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1174.82 --> 1180.34]  And mine are keys to Zion City,
[1180.34 --> 1184.64]  where beside the King I walk.
[1185.02 --> 1189.28]  For there my heart has found his treasure.
[1189.92 --> 1193.74]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1194.20 --> 1198.44]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1199.04 --> 1203.12]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1210.34 --> 1214.64]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1214.64 --> 1217.02]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1217.02 --> 1218.14]  Christ is mine forevermore.
[1218.14 --> 1222.24]  So at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school.
[1222.24 --> 1233.52]  So when we look at a holy God, as we've done in our praise,
[1234.42 --> 1239.50]  and then as we look at ourselves, we are aware of the contrast between the two.
[1240.46 --> 1246.42]  But this distance between what God has created us to be and what we are because of our sin,
[1246.42 --> 1250.42]  the distance between a holy God and ourselves, has been solved.
[1251.08 --> 1255.56]  Because as we just sang, Christ has paid for every failing.
[1256.34 --> 1258.04]  And I am his forevermore.
[1258.70 --> 1259.82]  Friends, that's the good news.
[1259.90 --> 1260.42]  That's the gospel.
[1261.76 --> 1265.24]  And so we come to this time of confession with this good news.
[1265.24 --> 1272.58]  That as we acknowledge our sin and our need, that we are met by a God who forgives.
[1273.58 --> 1280.82]  And not only that, not only by a God who forgives, but also by a God who heals and transforms us.
[1281.72 --> 1285.82]  So let's say this prayer together as we go to the Lord and confess our sins.
[1285.82 --> 1296.64]  Jesus, Lord, in your mercy, by your holy life that heals us, by your holy death that saves us,
[1297.16 --> 1303.80]  by your Holy Spirit with us, come to cleanse these sinners that we are.
[1305.06 --> 1307.40]  Set us free to obey you.
[1308.32 --> 1310.72]  Make us clear to stand before you.
[1311.30 --> 1314.54]  Then for your mercy, we will praise you.
[1314.54 --> 1315.46]  Amen.
[1316.64 --> 1324.34]  Speak silently and personally to your Lord now, to acknowledge your sin and seek him as your Savior.
[1324.34 --> 1351.00]  Brothers and sisters, now hear these words where God assures us of his pardon.
[1351.00 --> 1359.28]  But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope.
[1360.50 --> 1363.64]  The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[1364.44 --> 1366.90]  His mercies never come to an end.
[1367.50 --> 1369.34]  They are new every morning.
[1369.96 --> 1371.94]  Great is your faithfulness.
[1373.00 --> 1375.22]  Sisters and brothers, hear the good news.
[1375.22 --> 1378.50]  Your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
[1379.36 --> 1380.44]  Thanks be to God.
[1381.16 --> 1383.74]  Let's stand and let's sing a song of response.
[1383.74 --> 1386.02]  God, good to me.
[1386.02 --> 1386.06]  Good to me.
[1386.06 --> 1404.52]  I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me.
[1404.52 --> 1406.52]  God, good to me.
[1406.52 --> 1407.52]  I am weak.
[1407.52 --> 1411.52]  I need your love to free me.
[1411.52 --> 1415.52]  Oh, Lord, my rock.
[1415.52 --> 1419.86]  My strength and weakness.
[1419.86 --> 1423.52]  Come rescue me.
[1423.52 --> 1424.52]  Oh, Lord.
[1424.52 --> 1428.52]  You are my hope.
[1428.52 --> 1434.52]  Your promise never fails me.
[1434.52 --> 1441.52]  And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1441.52 --> 1445.14]  For you are good.
[1445.14 --> 1447.10]  For you are good.
[1447.10 --> 1451.00]  For you are good to me.
[1451.00 --> 1453.20]  For you are good.
[1453.30 --> 1455.12]  For you are good.
[1455.26 --> 1459.18]  For you are good to me.
[1459.18 --> 1471.80]  I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me.
[1471.80 --> 1474.70]  I am weak.
[1475.28 --> 1478.80]  I need your love to free me.
[1479.70 --> 1482.42]  Oh, Lord, my rock.
[1483.06 --> 1486.64]  My strength and weakness.
[1486.64 --> 1490.64]  Come rescue me.
[1490.64 --> 1493.64]  Oh, Lord.
[1493.64 --> 1495.64]  You are my hope.
[1495.64 --> 1501.52]  Your promise never fails me.
[1501.52 --> 1508.64]  And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1508.64 --> 1511.26]  For you are good.
[1511.26 --> 1513.12]  For you are good.
[1513.12 --> 1517.12]  For you are good to me.
[1517.12 --> 1519.12]  For you are good.
[1519.12 --> 1521.12]  For you are good.
[1521.12 --> 1525.12]  For you are good to me.
[1525.12 --> 1549.12]  For you are good to me.
[1549.12 --> 1556.30]  are as a church, not only as a local church, but as part of God's global church around the world,
[1556.80 --> 1562.40]  we are in the church season called Epiphany. And this is the season when the church around the
[1562.40 --> 1569.34]  world considers the life, the ministry, and the teachings of Jesus, right? In Advent, we anticipated
[1569.34 --> 1576.30]  his coming. In Christmas, we celebrated that he has indeed come. And now in Epiphany, he is here
[1576.30 --> 1581.62]  and he's teaching about the kingdom of God. He's healing the sick. He's opening the eyes of the
[1581.62 --> 1588.32]  blind. He's doing all these things. And so part of what it means in this season is this idea that we
[1588.32 --> 1598.00]  come and we sit at Jesus's feet as his disciples and learn what it means for us to follow after him.
[1599.10 --> 1605.20]  And the way that we are doing that as a church is through a sermon series called Teach Us to Pray.
[1605.20 --> 1612.86]  We're looking at the Lord's Prayer in Matthew chapter 6. The Lord's Prayer begins,
[1614.20 --> 1628.14]  Our Father in heaven. Jesus doesn't teach us to pray, My Father, but what? Our Father. Not singular,
[1628.14 --> 1637.52]  my, but our. So even if you are in, you close the door, you go into that room that Jesus talked about
[1637.52 --> 1641.42]  earlier. You're by yourself and you're going to pray the Lord's Prayer. What do you do? Do you say,
[1642.04 --> 1650.84]  well, I'm by myself, so do I say, My Father in heaven? No. It's our Father in heaven. Because if you're
[1650.84 --> 1658.50]  in the family of God, you've got lots of brothers and sisters because God has a big family, right?
[1658.64 --> 1664.70]  So this is a family prayer. And so when you pray the Lord's Prayer, one of the beautiful things about
[1664.70 --> 1670.86]  this is that you are joining your brothers and sisters throughout the ages, right back to the
[1670.86 --> 1676.34]  first disciples that Jesus was teaching this prayer to. And you're joining your brothers and sisters
[1676.34 --> 1684.32]  around the world coming before the Father with these words that Jesus taught us. There's a movie
[1684.32 --> 1690.60]  that probably we're all familiar with called Up, right? So there's an older gentleman who sold
[1690.60 --> 1695.72]  balloons all of his life. And toward the end of the movie, he meets a neighbor, this kid, and they're
[1695.72 --> 1701.78]  going to go on an adventure. They're leaving. So they fill up the balloons and they lift the house right
[1701.78 --> 1710.30]  off the ground. Well, can they do that with one balloon? No. Can they do it with 10 balloons? No.
[1711.16 --> 1717.68]  Right? And likewise, the church is lifted up and propelled by the prayers of all of God's children
[1717.68 --> 1724.86]  praying together. And so one way to symbolize that is that today and for the next few weeks,
[1724.86 --> 1728.46]  we're going to hear the Lord's Prayer read in a bunch of different languages.
[1728.46 --> 1735.78]  because it is the prayer of God's big global family. This is the prayer that people are saying
[1735.78 --> 1742.22]  in languages all over the world, in their own language, praying to their own father. But we're
[1742.22 --> 1746.40]  all joined together. And so with that, I'm going to invite John to come up and he's going to read it
[1746.40 --> 1747.08]  for us in French.
[1747.28 --> 1748.80]  Blessed Where
[1748.80 --> 1749.80]  Amen.
[1778.80 --> 1792.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1792.84 --> 1793.84]  Amen.
[1793.84 --> 1811.12]  And we will also continue as we're in this series, go through the Heidelberg Catechism
[1811.12 --> 1812.74]  in the section on the Lord's Prayer.
[1812.96 --> 1814.02]  So let's turn to that as well.
[1814.12 --> 1815.70]  Question number 22.
[1816.82 --> 1818.38]  What does the first petition mean?
[1819.02 --> 1819.38]  Please.
[1819.38 --> 1820.38]  Please.
[1820.38 --> 1828.66]  Hallowed be your name means help us to truly know you, to honor, glorify, and praise you
[1828.66 --> 1833.44]  for all your works and for all that shines forth from them.
[1834.16 --> 1840.72]  Your almighty power, wisdom, kindness, justice, mercy, and truth.
[1840.72 --> 1850.22]  And it means help us to direct all our living, what we think, say, and do, so that your name
[1850.22 --> 1856.96]  will never be blasphemed because of us, but always honored and praised.
[1857.92 --> 1859.12]  Let's pray together.
[1859.12 --> 1866.76]  Lord, we thank you for your word, which can speak into our lives, into our heads, into
[1866.76 --> 1867.46]  our hearts.
[1868.36 --> 1874.38]  Lord, we can feel so overwhelmed by the things going on within us and around us.
[1875.08 --> 1880.46]  And so we ask that as we come to your word now, that you would speak to us in such a way
[1880.46 --> 1888.32]  that we are reminded of your goodness and of your care, and also that we would be increasingly
[1888.32 --> 1893.98]  shaped into the people that you have called us to be by your grace.
[1894.60 --> 1896.16]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[1897.16 --> 1897.54]  Amen.
[1897.54 --> 1897.62]  Amen.
[1899.68 --> 1904.00]  So Martin Luther wrote in one of his works on prayer, and he says this.
[1904.88 --> 1911.94]  He says, how many pray, okay, so how many pray the Lord's Prayer a thousand times in the
[1911.94 --> 1912.60]  course of a year?
[1913.88 --> 1921.72]  And if they were to keep on doing so for a thousand more years, they would not have really
[1921.72 --> 1925.60]  prayed or tasted it at all.
[1925.60 --> 1930.40]  And I'm sure many of us can relate to that.
[1930.98 --> 1933.98]  He's saying with the Lord's Prayer, you know, we're so familiar with it.
[1934.14 --> 1940.96]  When we say it, it comes so naturally to us that sometimes we can rattle it off and not
[1940.96 --> 1944.34]  even be aware of what we're saying.
[1945.74 --> 1952.04]  And so one of the things that we want to do with this series is to slow down the Lord's
[1952.04 --> 1952.32]  Prayer.
[1952.32 --> 1957.06]  And to really, as Martin Luther says, taste it.
[1957.80 --> 1957.90]  Right?
[1957.96 --> 1959.12]  To taste the Lord's Prayer.
[1959.46 --> 1965.62]  To take the time to savor it and enjoy it and let it nourish us.
[1966.26 --> 1973.06]  And let it cause us to grow and be shaped as Jesus' disciples.
[1973.06 --> 1979.64]  One thing I learned recently about the Lord's Prayer is that what it does is it shapes our
[1979.64 --> 1980.26]  desires.
[1981.70 --> 1981.88]  Right?
[1981.98 --> 1989.00]  If the Ten Commandments teach us how to live, the Lord's Prayer teaches us how to desire.
[1990.36 --> 1994.62]  And the way that we're going to do this, slow down and taste the Lord's Prayer, is just by
[1994.62 --> 1999.34]  taking hold of each petition of the Lord's Prayer each week and asking, well, what does
[1999.34 --> 1999.94]  this mean?
[1999.94 --> 2000.00]  What does it mean?
[2000.56 --> 2002.08]  So when we pray it, what does it mean?
[2002.14 --> 2002.78]  What are we praying?
[2003.48 --> 2008.92]  And then more than that, how do we then take the priorities and the petitions of that prayer
[2008.92 --> 2013.30]  and use them to give shape to our own prayers?
[2014.74 --> 2018.04]  And so today, we come to the first petition.
[2019.08 --> 2019.30]  All right?
[2019.34 --> 2020.62]  Last week, our Father in Heaven.
[2020.68 --> 2021.54]  That's the address.
[2021.80 --> 2024.94]  We pray to God as our Father who is in Heaven.
[2024.94 --> 2027.54]  And then here's our first request when we come to Him.
[2028.06 --> 2028.68]  What is it?
[2030.04 --> 2031.60]  Hallowed be your name.
[2032.50 --> 2033.36]  Hallowed be your name.
[2034.16 --> 2039.44]  You know, and of all the requests that we make in this prayer, the Lord's Prayer, I suppose
[2039.44 --> 2048.54]  that this is one that may seem to us the most strange or the most difficult to get our minds
[2048.54 --> 2049.00]  around.
[2049.00 --> 2049.48]  Right?
[2049.48 --> 2050.16]  Right?
[2050.22 --> 2052.72]  We have a sense that we pray, hallowed be your name.
[2052.80 --> 2055.78]  We have a sense that we're asking for something significant.
[2056.94 --> 2057.18]  Right?
[2057.24 --> 2061.76]  We're asking for something weighty and important, and we are.
[2061.76 --> 2066.12]  But sometimes, we're not entirely sure what we're asking for.
[2066.62 --> 2067.42]  Hallowed be your name.
[2067.60 --> 2067.72]  You know?
[2068.36 --> 2070.32]  It's kind of abstract sounding.
[2071.30 --> 2075.82]  But yet, this is the petition that Jesus teaches us to pray first.
[2076.84 --> 2077.82]  There's a priority.
[2078.80 --> 2082.24]  And He teaches us to pray this first because, think about Jesus' life.
[2082.24 --> 2089.94]  His whole life, His whole mission is about hallowing the name of His Father.
[2090.82 --> 2090.98]  Right?
[2091.18 --> 2096.44]  That He has a passion that God's name would be hallowed.
[2097.26 --> 2102.16]  So what are we praying when we pray, our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name?
[2103.42 --> 2107.68]  So I just want to look at this phrase, hallowed be your name.
[2107.68 --> 2108.68]  But first, name.
[2108.82 --> 2113.56]  What is Jesus getting at when He uses this word, name?
[2114.74 --> 2120.60]  Well, in the world of the Bible, names were more than just labels.
[2121.36 --> 2122.62]  Maybe you have a name.
[2122.80 --> 2123.60]  Well, of course you have a name.
[2125.18 --> 2126.38]  Where did that name come from?
[2126.44 --> 2127.18]  What does it mean?
[2127.66 --> 2132.64]  Sometimes it's, well, my parents gave me this name because they liked it.
[2133.36 --> 2134.18]  More or less.
[2134.36 --> 2135.66]  It sounds nice, right?
[2137.68 --> 2144.22]  But in the Bible, someone's name is a way of referring to their nature, their character.
[2145.24 --> 2151.40]  You know, in modern terms, your name is kind of like your profile on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter.
[2151.70 --> 2154.62]  It's like kind of a mini snapshot of who you are.
[2155.06 --> 2159.06]  The things that you've said, the things that you have done, and your reputation.
[2159.06 --> 2164.00]  And so the Father wants us to know His name.
[2164.64 --> 2165.92]  Who He is.
[2166.12 --> 2167.36]  What He is really like.
[2167.42 --> 2168.00]  His nature.
[2168.14 --> 2168.82]  His character.
[2169.54 --> 2173.62]  He wants us to know Him when we say that.
[2173.66 --> 2174.10]  His name.
[2174.74 --> 2175.78]  And so God has a name.
[2176.76 --> 2178.14]  He has a personal name.
[2178.94 --> 2181.58]  And He has lots of nicknames.
[2181.58 --> 2188.04]  I don't know if you have a nickname or you had a friend or maybe a kid who you would use a nickname to call them.
[2189.74 --> 2193.96]  What are some of the nicknames of God in the Bible?
[2194.06 --> 2195.40]  Well, there are lots of them.
[2196.38 --> 2197.34]  Elohim, right?
[2197.46 --> 2199.92]  Is the name that acknowledges God as creator.
[2200.12 --> 2204.20]  In the beginning, God, Elohim, created the heavens and the earth.
[2204.66 --> 2205.42]  He's the creator.
[2205.80 --> 2207.22]  That tells us something about Him.
[2207.22 --> 2207.82]  Elohim.
[2208.82 --> 2210.26]  He is El Shaddai.
[2211.30 --> 2211.52]  Right?
[2211.64 --> 2212.78]  God Almighty.
[2213.28 --> 2218.08]  And of course, in Hebrew, whenever you have that prefix El, that means God.
[2218.42 --> 2219.40]  El Shaddai.
[2219.56 --> 2220.26]  God Almighty.
[2220.46 --> 2221.10]  El Roy.
[2221.26 --> 2222.44]  The God who sees.
[2223.96 --> 2225.42]  He is called our rock.
[2226.24 --> 2227.40]  Our fortress.
[2228.14 --> 2229.06]  Our refuge.
[2229.96 --> 2231.26]  He is the Holy One.
[2231.82 --> 2232.80]  Cleansing fire.
[2233.64 --> 2234.82]  Fountain of living water.
[2235.28 --> 2236.46]  Shepherd of the sheep.
[2237.22 --> 2238.54]  Lover of our souls.
[2238.66 --> 2238.72]  Right?
[2238.86 --> 2241.48]  All of these names for God.
[2241.90 --> 2245.56]  And each one of them, God is revealing something about who He is.
[2245.60 --> 2246.76]  It's not just a label.
[2247.50 --> 2249.78]  It tells us something about His character.
[2250.30 --> 2251.12]  His nature.
[2252.10 --> 2253.82]  He's telling us about who He is.
[2254.64 --> 2256.06]  But God's personal name.
[2256.10 --> 2257.04]  All those are nicknames.
[2257.90 --> 2259.12]  God's personal name.
[2259.18 --> 2261.46]  The name above all names is what?
[2262.68 --> 2263.20]  Yahweh.
[2263.20 --> 2263.80]  Yahweh.
[2263.80 --> 2267.04]  It used to be translated as Jehovah.
[2267.26 --> 2268.40]  You might be more familiar with that.
[2268.48 --> 2271.56]  Now, scholars say, well, probably the more accurate translation is Yahweh.
[2271.64 --> 2272.06]  It's the same thing.
[2272.12 --> 2272.38]  Jehovah.
[2272.74 --> 2273.14]  Yahweh.
[2274.40 --> 2278.72]  You may know that this is the name that God told Moses from the burning bush.
[2278.72 --> 2287.02]  So, in Exodus chapter 3, Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them,
[2287.70 --> 2290.80]  the God of your fathers has sent me to you.
[2291.54 --> 2294.88]  But remember, they've been in slavery for 400 years.
[2294.98 --> 2299.48]  They don't know this God that their forefathers worshipped.
[2299.48 --> 2303.36]  So, what if they ask me, what is His name?
[2304.10 --> 2305.26]  What should I tell them?
[2307.22 --> 2310.42]  God said to Moses, I am who I am.
[2311.10 --> 2313.24]  This is what you are to say to the Israelites.
[2314.48 --> 2317.12]  I am has sent me to you.
[2317.42 --> 2318.70]  This is my name forever.
[2318.86 --> 2323.86]  The name you shall call me from generation to generation.
[2323.86 --> 2329.46]  The name Yahweh is related to the verb to be.
[2330.44 --> 2333.36]  So, the way you translate the name Yahweh is I am who I am.
[2334.02 --> 2341.34]  But the thing about this name Yahweh is that it doesn't really clarify much of anything about God's character or personality.
[2342.18 --> 2342.44]  Right?
[2342.54 --> 2343.38]  I am who I am.
[2343.46 --> 2344.26]  I mean, it's very abstract.
[2344.50 --> 2345.42]  It's very kind of strange.
[2346.54 --> 2349.86]  And in some mysterious way, then, God is seeming to say to Moses,
[2349.86 --> 2357.74]  You may call me by a name, but don't make the mistake of thinking that you thereby comprehend me.
[2360.06 --> 2364.54]  I am free to be who I will be.
[2364.68 --> 2366.76]  My name means I exist.
[2368.48 --> 2374.78]  God's name, in other words, signifies His sheer transcendence, His complete otherness.
[2374.78 --> 2382.00]  He is not like other gods, much less like mortal creatures like us.
[2383.32 --> 2393.42]  And yet, friends, and yet, at the same time, this is the name that God gives His people so that we may know Him in a relational way.
[2393.50 --> 2395.10]  This is the covenant name of God.
[2395.88 --> 2398.34]  So, God is not only I am who I am.
[2398.60 --> 2402.20]  He is also I am God with you and for you.
[2402.20 --> 2406.16]  I am God with you and for you.
[2406.88 --> 2413.62]  He says to Moses, I have heard my people's cry, and I am coming to rescue them.
[2415.16 --> 2416.60]  This is the Father's name.
[2417.26 --> 2419.46]  This is the name that He wants hallowed.
[2420.54 --> 2422.84]  So now, then, what does it mean to hallow something?
[2423.20 --> 2425.60]  That's the next thing we need to talk about.
[2425.60 --> 2429.88]  Well, hallow, it's related to the word holy.
[2431.40 --> 2436.04]  But it's a verb, to holy-fy, or something like that.
[2437.18 --> 2442.00]  And there are actually, and you look in the dictionary, you know, a Greek dictionary,
[2442.20 --> 2446.90]  there are three English words that together kind of capture the meaning of this word hallowed.
[2446.90 --> 2455.60]  So, here they are, three words, to treat, to include, to exclude, or to eliminate.
[2456.30 --> 2460.08]  Okay, so to treat, to include, to eliminate.
[2460.68 --> 2461.72]  So, let's look at these.
[2462.20 --> 2464.10]  The first meaning of hallowed is to treat.
[2464.72 --> 2468.28]  So, to hallow something means to treat it as sacred.
[2468.28 --> 2477.34]  It's to kind of set it apart as immensely special and treasured, unique.
[2478.08 --> 2486.40]  It's to treat it not only as that, but as the most important thing, the ultimate thing in your life.
[2486.40 --> 2495.76]  When you are adopted into God's family and become a child of God, the thing that then becomes the most important thing in your life is the Father's name.
[2496.24 --> 2501.20]  That it would be honored and revered in my life and in the world.
[2502.52 --> 2507.86]  Many of us have two sets of dishes in our homes.
[2508.14 --> 2509.66]  One set, what do we do?
[2509.74 --> 2511.52]  We use it for everyday use, right?
[2512.02 --> 2516.10]  Get a snack, grab a sandwich, you use that set of plates.
[2516.40 --> 2519.44]  In our family with young kids, we would have the plastic IKEA ones.
[2520.08 --> 2522.20]  Drop on the floor, boom, boom, boom, no problem, right?
[2522.80 --> 2528.06]  Or really, even if they're not IKEA plastic plates, maybe they're ceramic.
[2528.98 --> 2531.02]  They might get a chip, they might break.
[2531.44 --> 2532.38]  No big loss.
[2532.44 --> 2535.62]  Really, the biggest bother is cleaning it up so much than losing the plate.
[2536.50 --> 2541.62]  But you might have another set of plates that you use on special occasions.
[2542.38 --> 2545.84]  Maybe it's a set of china that you got on your wedding day.
[2545.84 --> 2549.02]  Or maybe it was passed down to you from your parents.
[2549.54 --> 2554.20]  And the one thing you don't do with your special set of china is use it to feed the dog.
[2555.16 --> 2559.44]  If you do that, you are no longer hallowing it, are you?
[2559.82 --> 2563.80]  You're no longer setting it apart and treating it as more important.
[2564.86 --> 2566.14]  You're dishonoring it.
[2566.18 --> 2567.20]  You're treating it as common.
[2567.30 --> 2567.90]  It may be worthless.
[2567.90 --> 2571.58]  And so the first line of the Lord's Prayer is,
[2572.28 --> 2577.76]  Father, so work in me that your name is of the greatest importance to me.
[2578.92 --> 2588.38]  Father, so work in this world that your name, your nature, your character are of the greatest importance.
[2588.38 --> 2591.74]  Tim Keller says,
[2592.34 --> 2596.56]  Something or someone is going to be hallowed in your life.
[2597.12 --> 2597.86]  Think about that.
[2599.08 --> 2605.24]  Something or someone is going to be hallowed in your life.
[2605.24 --> 2609.24]  Every human being hallows something.
[2610.24 --> 2614.92]  All of us treat something as of ultimate concern.
[2615.82 --> 2617.52]  Maybe it's our children.
[2618.34 --> 2620.02]  Or our reputation.
[2620.76 --> 2622.24]  Or our jobs.
[2622.94 --> 2623.68]  Our spouse.
[2624.66 --> 2626.74]  Our favorite sports team.
[2627.58 --> 2627.96]  Money.
[2629.90 --> 2630.74]  Recreation.
[2631.04 --> 2631.32]  Travel.
[2631.32 --> 2632.00]  Anything.
[2632.16 --> 2635.06]  Something is of most importance in your life.
[2635.58 --> 2640.28]  And what you treat as of ultimate concern is going to determine everything about you.
[2641.50 --> 2641.72]  Right?
[2641.80 --> 2646.50]  What you treat as most important shapes the way you then live.
[2647.20 --> 2647.44]  Right?
[2647.52 --> 2649.08]  It shapes the way you speak.
[2649.46 --> 2650.56]  What you think about.
[2650.98 --> 2652.24]  What you talk about.
[2652.42 --> 2653.70]  What you spend your money on.
[2653.80 --> 2654.66]  What you desire.
[2655.70 --> 2656.88]  And so when we pray,
[2656.88 --> 2659.24]  Father, please hallow your name in me.
[2659.24 --> 2663.28]  What we're saying is would you determine everything about me?
[2663.46 --> 2667.92]  Would you be the one that shapes who I am?
[2668.46 --> 2669.64]  Everything about me.
[2672.12 --> 2676.16]  Think of this first petition of the Lord's Prayer in light of the first commandment.
[2676.84 --> 2680.14]  What is the first commandment that we read in the book of Exodus?
[2680.14 --> 2686.38]  You shall have no other gods before me.
[2687.34 --> 2692.78]  Meaning, you shall have no other gods, God says, between me and you.
[2693.46 --> 2694.90]  Nothing in between us.
[2695.54 --> 2698.40]  I don't want anything to come between me and you.
[2699.36 --> 2699.74]  Right?
[2699.80 --> 2706.60]  I want you, I want me, to be in the top place in your heart.
[2706.60 --> 2711.66]  So the first commandment is, God alone will be God in my life.
[2711.76 --> 2714.42]  God alone will be of ultimate concern.
[2715.40 --> 2720.58]  Then to now with this first petition, we pray, Father, make it so.
[2721.74 --> 2725.44]  Father, be hallowed in my life and in the world.
[2726.14 --> 2727.38]  Hallowed be your name.
[2727.38 --> 2734.16]  And friends, this is a request for a miracle.
[2735.36 --> 2735.60]  Right?
[2737.12 --> 2742.04]  Does your heart, does this world naturally hallow God's name?
[2742.32 --> 2742.62]  No.
[2743.82 --> 2749.46]  What we're doing is we're praying for God to do a deep work in our hearts.
[2749.46 --> 2758.74]  To transform us, to change us, so that the Father and his character are the ultimate concern in our lives.
[2760.56 --> 2764.90]  Okay, so, but not only does hallowed mean to tree as holy, the second meaning is to include.
[2765.84 --> 2770.44]  To include another person in the inner circle of what is holy.
[2770.44 --> 2777.42]  So, for example, in the opening to Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, he says this.
[2777.80 --> 2787.04]  To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified, hallowed, same word, in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people.
[2789.24 --> 2789.50]  Right?
[2790.44 --> 2791.82]  Would they be included?
[2792.06 --> 2793.04]  Would they be your people?
[2793.14 --> 2797.62]  Would they become part of this sanctified inner circle of your holiness?
[2797.62 --> 2804.74]  So, the first petition is, Father, include me in the inner life of your name.
[2805.46 --> 2805.68]  Right?
[2805.78 --> 2807.14]  Include me in your holiness.
[2807.80 --> 2812.74]  Include me in the nature and character of your life and your power and your joy.
[2812.88 --> 2817.10]  Would you draw me in to be part of that?
[2818.68 --> 2823.80]  And to bring us, all of God's children, into all that your name means.
[2824.40 --> 2826.38]  Everything that you are.
[2826.38 --> 2828.82]  Would you draw us in?
[2830.22 --> 2837.94]  And the third meaning of hallow is not just to treat as holy, not to include, but also to eliminate.
[2839.14 --> 2842.26]  Eliminate that which is incompatible with holiness.
[2843.28 --> 2843.40]  Right?
[2843.44 --> 2846.78]  And so, when we think about holy, sometimes we have in our minds the idea of being set apart.
[2847.16 --> 2848.32]  And that's what this part means.
[2848.32 --> 2853.32]  So, Paul closes his first letter of Thessalonians with a benediction.
[2854.78 --> 2855.26]  And he says,
[2855.38 --> 2860.76]  May God himself, the God of peace, hallow you, sanctify you through and through.
[2861.16 --> 2866.28]  May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2866.28 --> 2869.98]  So, this prayer is,
[2870.66 --> 2878.36]  Father, take away everything in me that is not in sync with who you are.
[2878.36 --> 2889.76]  Father, take away everything in this world that isn't in sync and that does not square with your character in your name.
[2889.76 --> 2897.38]  So, friends, I hope this helps us just a little bit more lay hold of this word, hallow.
[2898.72 --> 2900.92]  Father, hallowed be your name.
[2901.62 --> 2903.88]  Make your name my ultimate concern.
[2904.84 --> 2909.42]  Include me in all that you are, all that your name means.
[2910.34 --> 2914.84]  And, Father, purify me of all that is not of you.
[2914.84 --> 2919.68]  You know, we have this great hymn, Be Thou My Vision.
[2920.88 --> 2924.34]  It says, Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[2924.78 --> 2928.96]  And then this phrase, kind of a very confusing phrase.
[2929.64 --> 2934.52]  Not be all else to me, save that thou art.
[2935.36 --> 2936.40]  What does that mean?
[2937.44 --> 2940.94]  It means, I want you to be of ultimate concern in my life.
[2942.12 --> 2942.32]  Right?
[2942.36 --> 2943.86]  I want you to have the highest place.
[2943.86 --> 2953.70]  If everything else is not nothing, let everything else be nothing except for you in my life.
[2954.90 --> 2957.36]  And that's what it means to pray, hallowed be your name.
[2958.86 --> 2961.56]  And remember, we're not doing it.
[2961.70 --> 2961.94]  Right?
[2962.04 --> 2962.86]  We're not doing it.
[2963.60 --> 2965.72]  We're asking God to do it.
[2966.36 --> 2967.54]  Because we can't.
[2967.58 --> 2968.38]  We can't do it.
[2968.38 --> 2971.72]  Lord, I can't transform my own heart.
[2972.06 --> 2977.82]  I can't change the world to treat you as of ultimate importance.
[2977.94 --> 2979.62]  So, Lord, you do it.
[2980.32 --> 2981.30]  You be at work.
[2981.30 --> 2986.54]  I can't include myself or others into the circle of your holiness.
[2987.18 --> 2990.82]  I can't draw myself or others to you, Lord.
[2991.02 --> 2991.82]  You do it.
[2991.82 --> 2997.98]  I certainly cannot eliminate all of the junk in my heart and in my life that dishonors your name.
[2998.34 --> 3000.46]  Lord, you need to come and do it.
[3001.46 --> 3003.36]  So, friends, that's the invitation of this prayer.
[3004.32 --> 3004.42]  Right?
[3004.42 --> 3009.40]  Jesus is inviting us into the deepest passion of God's heart.
[3009.92 --> 3012.06]  To be taken up with what matters most to God.
[3012.12 --> 3019.30]  What matters most to God is the honor of his name in our lives and in the world.
[3020.26 --> 3020.36]  Right?
[3020.42 --> 3025.24]  God cares about the fact that he made the world and the world is broken.
[3025.86 --> 3026.06]  Right?
[3026.06 --> 3035.70]  What he made, what he has set his name to, his own creation, has become marred and destroyed by sin.
[3035.96 --> 3038.12]  And God is not happy about it.
[3039.14 --> 3039.34]  Right?
[3039.36 --> 3043.66]  And that's why the gospel is that Jesus comes into the world and says,
[3043.66 --> 3049.80]  This place is a complete ruin and I will not allow it to remain this way anymore.
[3050.74 --> 3053.66]  Because God's name is at stake.
[3055.02 --> 3059.74]  So, Jesus has come because what matters to God is the mending of this world.
[3060.96 --> 3061.12]  Right?
[3061.22 --> 3065.28]  And just think about if you create a beautiful painting or you make something,
[3066.28 --> 3069.56]  often what you do is you put your name on it.
[3069.74 --> 3069.96]  Right?
[3069.96 --> 3074.32]  We have some paintings in our foyer by Stephen, Pastor Nancy's husband.
[3075.28 --> 3078.30]  And you can see in the bottom right-hand corner, Stephen Joe.
[3079.06 --> 3080.22]  His name is on it.
[3080.26 --> 3083.18]  And that picture represents the artist.
[3083.88 --> 3088.96]  And if someone then came along and got a marker and scribbled on the painting,
[3089.10 --> 3091.22]  how would Stephen feel about it?
[3091.96 --> 3092.60]  He would say,
[3092.90 --> 3094.44]  This isn't what I made.
[3095.02 --> 3095.20]  Right?
[3095.26 --> 3096.44]  This is ruined.
[3097.56 --> 3099.26]  This needs to be fixed.
[3099.96 --> 3102.70]  This needs to be cleaned up because my name is on it.
[3102.90 --> 3103.66]  It's valuable.
[3104.22 --> 3104.92]  I made it.
[3105.40 --> 3108.88]  The Bible says that God made all of the world in that it is glorious.
[3109.74 --> 3110.04]  Right?
[3110.06 --> 3112.48]  We look all around us, even at a foggy day like this.
[3112.70 --> 3115.26]  And we can just feast our eyes on the beauty of creation.
[3115.38 --> 3116.80]  We look at it and what do we say?
[3117.44 --> 3119.44]  God, you are glorious.
[3120.90 --> 3121.76]  You're awesome.
[3122.22 --> 3125.06]  The heavens declare the glory of God.
[3125.36 --> 3127.46]  He put his name on the creation.
[3127.46 --> 3131.10]  And what's the masterpiece of all of the creation?
[3131.10 --> 3133.38]  It's us.
[3134.02 --> 3134.38]  People.
[3134.54 --> 3135.06]  Men and women.
[3135.26 --> 3136.08]  Girls and boys.
[3137.08 --> 3139.50]  The Bible says that he made us in his own image.
[3139.58 --> 3141.30]  He put his name on us.
[3142.38 --> 3145.48]  His name is attached to what he made.
[3146.74 --> 3147.94]  God's name is at stake.
[3148.06 --> 3148.52]  And so we pray,
[3148.74 --> 3152.26]  Lord, the mending of this broken world matters to you because it's yours.
[3152.42 --> 3153.14]  You created it.
[3153.18 --> 3153.82]  You love it.
[3153.82 --> 3160.36]  The world is broken and your heart now is broken because of how mucked up this world is by sin.
[3161.82 --> 3165.60]  And so God looks at the world and he sees children going to bed hungry.
[3166.74 --> 3169.38]  He sees children neglected and orphaned.
[3170.14 --> 3173.12]  He sees marriages splintering.
[3173.82 --> 3175.34]  He sees sex trafficking.
[3176.06 --> 3177.54]  He sees the oppression of people.
[3177.70 --> 3178.42]  He sees homelessness.
[3178.42 --> 3181.12]  His name is at stake.
[3182.70 --> 3184.34]  So when you and I pray,
[3184.50 --> 3185.36]  hallowed be your name,
[3185.42 --> 3185.80]  we're saying,
[3185.88 --> 3188.64]  God, I am not satisfied with the brokenness of this world.
[3190.22 --> 3191.88]  Children are going to bed hungry.
[3192.70 --> 3194.74]  God, it's about the glory of your name.
[3195.80 --> 3197.00]  Give them bread to eat.
[3198.70 --> 3201.16]  People are broken because of their sin.
[3201.36 --> 3204.88]  Father, forgive them for your name's sake.
[3204.88 --> 3205.20]  Right?
[3206.46 --> 3208.26]  People are captured by addictions.
[3208.36 --> 3209.88]  Unless you deliver them from evil,
[3210.06 --> 3211.26]  they haven't got a chance.
[3211.40 --> 3214.90]  Lord, deliver them so that you will be glorified.
[3216.56 --> 3217.08]  Right?
[3217.12 --> 3217.60]  When we pray,
[3217.72 --> 3218.52]  hallowed be your name,
[3219.12 --> 3222.14]  we pray for God's heart,
[3222.46 --> 3226.02]  a holy discontent with the brokenness of God's world.
[3227.32 --> 3231.44]  And we take up Jesus' deepest passions as our own.
[3232.64 --> 3232.82]  Right?
[3232.82 --> 3234.34]  As Jesus was prepared,
[3235.52 --> 3237.08]  preparing to die on the cross
[3237.08 --> 3240.20]  and face the terror of God's wrath
[3240.20 --> 3241.94]  against the sin of this world,
[3242.18 --> 3244.06]  this is what he says in John 12.
[3244.22 --> 3245.06]  We'll end with this.
[3246.44 --> 3247.14]  Jesus says,
[3247.22 --> 3248.48]  Now my soul is troubled,
[3248.56 --> 3249.80]  and what shall I say?
[3250.50 --> 3251.96]  Father, save me from this hour?
[3252.76 --> 3253.18]  No.
[3254.32 --> 3257.36]  It was for this very reason
[3257.36 --> 3259.22]  I came to this hour.
[3259.98 --> 3262.06]  Father, glorify your name.
[3262.82 --> 3264.96]  Then a voice came from heaven.
[3265.44 --> 3267.06]  I have glorified it
[3267.06 --> 3269.88]  and will glorify it again.
[3271.44 --> 3272.24]  See, friends,
[3272.38 --> 3273.64]  Jesus lived this prayer.
[3274.38 --> 3276.84]  And he lived it all the way to the cross
[3276.84 --> 3280.02]  so that you and I could be adopted as God's children.
[3280.42 --> 3283.08]  And so that we can then take up God's passions,
[3284.20 --> 3284.84]  ourselves,
[3285.26 --> 3287.08]  that he would be glorified
[3287.08 --> 3288.30]  in our lives
[3288.30 --> 3290.18]  and in all the world.
[3291.28 --> 3292.18]  Let's pray together.
[3296.48 --> 3298.62]  Our Father, glorify your name
[3298.62 --> 3300.40]  in all the earth.
[3301.76 --> 3303.52]  Glorify it in our lives,
[3303.98 --> 3306.72]  in our families,
[3307.00 --> 3307.90]  in our workplaces,
[3308.30 --> 3309.00]  in our homes,
[3309.00 --> 3311.58]  in our hobbies,
[3312.24 --> 3314.52]  in our neighborhoods,
[3315.16 --> 3316.42]  in this country.
[3317.54 --> 3318.72]  Lord, and in your world,
[3318.92 --> 3320.06]  would your name be glorified.
[3320.92 --> 3321.84]  Would you come?
[3322.84 --> 3325.78]  Would you have your name hallowed
[3325.78 --> 3327.80]  in the earth?
[3328.56 --> 3330.16]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3330.88 --> 3331.20]  Amen.
[3331.20 --> 3333.74]  So let's stand
[3333.74 --> 3334.66]  and let's sing
[3334.66 --> 3336.72]  a song of response together
[3336.72 --> 3338.20]  and glorify his name.
[3338.20 --> 3368.18]  Thank you.
[3368.20 --> 3372.64]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[3374.10 --> 3378.18]  Who else could make every king bow down?
[3379.32 --> 3383.82]  Who else could whisper and darkness trembles?
[3384.24 --> 3388.48]  Only a holy God.
[3390.50 --> 3394.68]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[3394.68 --> 3400.48]  What other splendor outshines the sun?
[3401.16 --> 3405.02]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[3406.40 --> 3410.28]  Only a holy God.
[3410.28 --> 3420.22]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[3420.90 --> 3424.12]  Cry out, sing holy.
[3424.72 --> 3428.12]  Forever a holy God.
[3428.12 --> 3433.16]  Come and worship the holy God.
[3434.30 --> 3439.10]  What other glory consumes like fire?
[3440.10 --> 3444.28]  What other power can raise the dead?
[3445.30 --> 3449.00]  What other name remains undefeated?
[3449.00 --> 3453.78]  Only a holy God.
[3454.14 --> 3456.16]  What other journeys can do?
