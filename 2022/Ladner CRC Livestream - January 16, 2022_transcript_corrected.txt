[319.42 → 325.42] We're happy you could be with us this morning, whether in person or on YouTube.
[325.42 → 331.42] And if you're a visitor, we are especially pleased that you're able to worship with us this morning.
[331.42 → 335.42] I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader this morning.
[335.42 → 346.42] Pastor Jason will be bringing us God's message, Praying to Our Father, as he continues his series on the Lord's Prayer from Matthew 6.
[346.42 → 350.42] We have a couple of announcements.
[350.42 → 360.42] First, just a reminder that there's a funeral service for Code Brine on Thursday at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[360.42 → 378.42] Also, you are invited to join a listening circle, a small group of six to eight people that connect with each other regarding the Christian Reformed Church's Human Sexuality Report that will come before Synod in 2022.
[378.42 → 385.42] You can sign up on the sheet on the foyer table or email or call the church office.
[385.42 → 388.42] And there's more information in your bulletin.
[388.42 → 394.42] Coffee break, a Bible study for men and women, started this past week.
[394.42 → 397.42] It started up again after a break over Christmas.
[397.42 → 402.42] And the Bible study meets from 9.30 to 11 on Wednesday mornings.
[402.42 → 406.42] And you're invited to join the groups or drop in when you are able.
[406.42 → 418.42] Okay, your bulletin insert this morning indicates that today is Sanctity of Human Life Sunday.
[418.42 → 430.42] When we celebrate God's gift of life, commemorate the lives lost to abortion, commit to protecting human life at every stage.
[430.42 → 453.42] And as one way of responding to this, our offering today is for the Crisis Pregnancy Centre, a nonprofit agency providing support to women experiencing unplanned pregnancies, post-abortion grief, domestic violence, and sexual assault.
[453.42 → 458.42] We are still not passing the collection plates down the aisles or the rows.
[458.42 → 468.42] You can give your offering by dropping it off at the church, placing it in the boxes at the back of the church here, the sanctuary, mailing it, or giving online.
[468.42 → 476.42] If you are able, would you please rise for the call to worship?
[485.42 → 489.42] So you will have the little double arrow, okay, for the congregation.
[489.42 → 498.42] Oh, come, let us worship the Lord and consider what wondrous things God has done.
[498.42 → 504.42] The Magi who study the heavens follow a guiding star.
[504.42 → 511.42] Oh, come, let us worship the Lord and consider what wondrous things God has done.
[511.42 → 516.42] The peoples who live in the shadows see a glorious light.
[516.42 → 523.42] Oh, come, let us worship the Lord and consider what wondrous things God has done.
[523.42 → 535.42] Christ who embodies word unveils a hidden plan, making us joint heirs of the promise of salvation through the gospel.
[535.42 → 541.42] Oh, come, let us worship the Lord, for God has done wondrous things.
[541.42 → 548.42] God's greeting is from Jude 1 and 2.
[548.42 → 558.42] To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ.
[558.42 → 563.42] May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[563.42 → 568.42] As God has greeted us, so let us greet each other.
[568.42 → 569.42] many of you.
[569.42 → 570.42] How are United, we will be your kingdom?
[570.42 → 571.42] We will sing to God our respond.
[571.42 → 573.42] Amen.
[573.42 → 574.42] Amen.

[598.42 → 609.52] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our King
[609.52 → 617.36] Bring on the power of His grace, the beauty of His peace
[617.36 → 625.28] Remember how His mercy reached, and we find out to Him
[625.28 → 633.18] He lifted us to solid ground, to freedom from our sin
[633.18 → 640.94] O sing my soul and tell what He's done
[640.94 → 646.34] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[646.34 → 655.14] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus
[655.14 → 664.74] Our Lord is bound in us, His way to live this world
[664.74 → 672.64] To share the reason for hope, to serve with love and grace
[672.64 → 680.54] Let all who see Him shine through us, and bring that Father praise
[680.54 → 688.44] I'll sing my soul and tell what He's done
[688.44 → 694.08] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[694.08 → 704.14] Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our King
[704.14 → 713.74] The world and heavens are filled with His glory
[713.74 → 719.64] Opened up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown
[719.64 → 728.14] We labour in His fields and grace as He leads sinners on
[728.14 → 735.34] Let's sing my soul and tell what He's done
[735.34 → 744.94] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[744.94 → 747.94] Oh sing my soul and tell what He's done
[747.94 → 752.94] Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory
[752.94 → 770.54] Oh sing my soul and heavens are filled with His glory
[770.54 → 775.64] Oh hear the power of Jesus, of God
[775.64 → 780.14] And His glory just was filled with His glory
[780.14 → 790.14] Ring forth the night of heaven, and of God
[790.14 → 796.14] Ring forth the night of heaven, and of God
[796.14 → 797.14] Amen.

[856.14 → 858.14] Amen.
[886.14 → 887.14] Amen.
[916.14 → 917.14] Amen.
[946.14 → 948.14] Amen.
[976.14 → 977.14] Amen.
[1006.14 → 1007.14] Amen.
[1036.14 → 1037.14] Amen.
[1066.14 → 1067.14] Amen.
[1096.14 → 1097.14] Amen.
[1097.14 → 1098.14] Amen.
[1098.14 → 1099.14] Amen.
[1099.14 → 1100.14] Amen.
[1100.14 → 1101.14] Amen.
[1101.14 → 1102.14] Amen.
[1102.14 → 1103.14] Amen.
[1103.14 → 1104.14] Amen.
[1104.14 → 1105.14] Amen.
[1113.14 → 1121.14] This time children ages 3 through grade 7 are welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School.
[1121.14 → 1135.04] For our time of confession, let us confess our sins before God and one another with these words.
[1136.12 → 1147.72] O God, our guide, who once used a star to lead people to Christ, we confess our poor sense of direction.
[1147.72 → 1154.54] We let ourselves become confused, easily distracted, and lose our way.
[1155.80 → 1159.10] We fail to follow the signs you provide.
[1160.06 → 1162.46] Forgive our waywardness, O God.
[1163.70 → 1169.58] Lead us to the Christ so that we may follow his way to you. Amen.
[1169.58 → 1169.76] Amen.
[1172.96 → 1179.76] God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness to our sin is from John 1, verses 9 and 12.
[1180.88 → 1186.58] The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
[1188.08 → 1197.26] Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
[1197.26 → 1198.14] Amen.
[1198.14 → 1221.44] There is a Redeemer, Jesus God's own Son.
[1221.44 → 1231.44] Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[1231.44 → 1242.44] Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son.
[1242.44 → 1252.44] And living Your Spirit to the work of God is done.
[1252.44 → 1264.44] Jesus, my Redeemer, name above our names.
[1264.44 → 1274.44] Wishes, my Father, my Son, long for sinners' sake.
[1274.44 → 1284.44] Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son.
[1284.44 → 1294.44] Believe in Your Spirit till the work of God is done.
[1294.44 → 1305.44] When I stand in glory, I will see His face.
[1305.44 → 1316.44] And there I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
[1316.44 → 1327.44] Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son.
[1327.44 → 1338.44] And living Your Spirit till the way our earth is done.
[1338.44 → 1358.44] Let's begin in prayer this morning.
[1358.44 → 1362.44] Our great God, the Triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[1362.44 → 1369.44] One God who has reigned eternal in glory, power, dominion, and majesty.
[1369.44 → 1372.44] Seated upon Your throne.
[1372.44 → 1374.44] Lord, You are great.
[1374.44 → 1378.44] You created the world, and You rule over all things.
[1378.44 → 1380.44] And Lord, You are also good.
[1380.44 → 1384.44] Because You have come in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1384.44 → 1390.44] who came in humility, dwelt among us, died, and rose again,
[1390.44 → 1395.44] that we might have life and that we might have this relationship,
[1395.44 → 1398.44] to call God our Heavenly Father.
[1398.44 → 1405.44] Lord, this morning we ask that You would fill us with Your Spirit,
[1405.44 → 1409.44] that we might know You more, follow You more closely,
[1409.44 → 1411.44] and praise You in our lives.
[1411.44 → 1416.44] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1416.44 → 1421.44] So, as was already said, we are in a new sermon series,
[1421.44 → 1423.44] looking at the Lord's Prayer.
[1423.44 → 1428.44] We began last week looking at some of the initial remarks that Jesus made,
[1428.44 → 1430.44] about how not to pray.
[1430.44 → 1432.44] Right? We don't need to pray like the hypocrites,
[1432.44 → 1434.44] who are always looking to be seen,
[1434.44 → 1436.44] because we know our Heavenly Father sees us.
[1436.44 → 1439.44] So we don't need to also pray like the pagans,
[1439.44 → 1442.44] who think they will be heard for their many words,
[1442.44 → 1446.44] because we know that our Father hears us as well.
[1446.44 → 1451.44] You know, and as we also said,
[1451.44 → 1457.44] the first question that Jesus' disciples are recorded to have asked Him is,
[1457.44 → 1460.44] Lord, teach us to pray.
[1460.44 → 1461.44] Right?
[1461.44 → 1466.44] Notice, they didn't ask Jesus to teach them how to lead a Bible study,
[1466.44 → 1468.44] or how to lead an elder meeting.
[1468.44 → 1473.44] They didn't ask Him how to heal the sick,
[1473.44 → 1477.44] and comfort the grieving, or to feed the hungry.
[1477.44 → 1482.44] But they asked Him, Lord, teach us to pray.
[1482.44 → 1484.44] And I think when they asked that question,
[1484.44 → 1489.44] it's not so much, Jesus, would you teach us some new techniques to pray?
[1489.44 → 1492.44] Would you teach us how to be more effective in our prayers?
[1492.44 → 1499.44] But rather, Jesus, will you teach us how to relate to the one whom you call Father,
[1499.44 → 1501.44] the way you do?
[1501.44 → 1505.44] How can we pray like you, Jesus?
[1505.44 → 1511.44] The intimacy, the joy, the strength that you have in your relationship with God the Father.
[1511.44 → 1513.44] So they said, Lord, teach us to pray.
[1513.44 → 1520.44] And so for this season of Epiphany, we are joining the disciples
[1520.44 → 1527.44] and learning how to pray to our Heavenly Father as Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's Prayer.
[1527.44 → 1531.44] So we're going to read the Lord's Prayer today.
[1531.44 → 1532.44] I'll read it for us.
[1532.44 → 1535.44] And then we'll also read from the Heidelberg Catechism,
[1535.44 → 1540.44] which has kind of the final part of the Catechism walks us through the Lord's Prayer.
[1540.44 → 1544.44] And it has questions and answers that go along with the Lord's Prayer.
[1544.44 → 1551.44] So we will read the questions pertaining to each petition as we go in the next coming weeks.
[1551.44 → 1556.44] So first, let's turn to Matthew chapter 6.
[1556.44 → 1559.44] And this is what our Lord Jesus says.
[1559.44 → 1562.44] This then is how you should pray.
[1562.44 → 1566.44] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[1566.44 → 1568.44] Your kingdom come.
[1568.44 → 1571.44] Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[1571.44 → 1577.44] Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[1577.44 → 1583.44] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[1583.44 → 1585.44] This is the word of the Lord.
[1585.44 → 1590.44] Now let's look at the Heidelberg Catechism, question 120.
[1590.44 → 1593.44] And when it's a question, I'll read it in the A for answer.
[1593.44 → 1596.44] I'll invite all of us to respond with the answer.
[1596.44 → 1603.44] So now why did Christ command us to call God our Father?
[1603.44 → 1610.44] To awaken in us at the very beginning of our prayer what should be basic to our prayer.
[1610.44 → 1615.44] A childlike reverence and trust.
[1615.44 → 1620.44] That through Christ, God has become our Father.
[1620.44 → 1626.44] And that just as our parents do not refuse us the good things of this life,
[1626.44 → 1633.44] even less will God our Father refuse to give us what we ask in faith.
[1633.44 → 1635.44] Okay, then the next question.
[1635.44 → 1638.44] Why the words in heaven?
[1638.44 → 1645.44] These words teach us not to think of God's heavenly majesty as something earthly
[1645.44 → 1652.44] and to expect everything needed for body and soul from God's almighty power.
[1652.44 → 1663.44] So this morning as we look at this, the Lord's Prayer, I want to begin by sharing a couple observations,
[1663.44 → 1667.44] kind of some overarching things about the Lord's Prayer as a whole.
[1667.44 → 1674.44] And then we're going to focus on the address of the prayer, which is our Father in heaven.
[1674.44 → 1678.44] So Jesus prefaces the prayer in verse 9.
[1678.44 → 1681.44] He says, this then is how you should pray.
[1681.44 → 1686.44] And so here are two main observations about the prayer as a whole.
[1686.44 → 1691.44] And the first is, the first observation is the fount of the prayer.
[1691.44 → 1693.44] Okay, the fount of the prayer.
[1693.44 → 1696.44] Andrew, help us out. There it is.
[1696.44 → 1702.44] It's really important to keep in mind, first, who is teaching us to pray, right?
[1702.44 → 1707.44] When the disciples ask, Lord, teach us to pray, they are looking to Jesus.
[1707.44 → 1712.44] They are asking him who they should pray to.
[1712.44 → 1717.44] So I, there is so much good material on the Lord's Prayer.
[1717.44 → 1720.44] It's almost, you know, embarrassment of riches.
[1720.44 → 1725.44] And so I've ordered a couple books on the Lord's Prayer.
[1725.44 → 1731.44] One of them I have found most helpful is from Daryl Johnson, who was Roger's pastor at First Baptist Church.
[1731.44 → 1734.44] He wrote a book about the Lord's Prayer.
[1734.44 → 1737.44] And so some of these observations come from him.
[1737.44 → 1739.44] And I think they're quite profound.
[1739.44 → 1743.44] So one thing is, when we look to the fount of the prayer, we're looking to Jesus.
[1743.44 → 1748.44] And the question then becomes, who is Jesus?
[1748.44 → 1750.44] Who is Jesus?
[1750.44 → 1756.44] Well, we know that he is both the son of Mary, and he is the son of God.
[1756.44 → 1761.44] As the son of Mary, he is fully human.
[1761.44 → 1765.44] And as the son of God, he is fully God.
[1765.44 → 1774.44] And so the teacher of this prayer, the one who teaches us to pray, we have to understand, is both fully human and fully God.
[1774.44 → 1777.44] Now, why is that important? Why does this matter?
[1777.44 → 1788.44] It's because, friends, there is absolutely no one else who could possibly be better to teach us how to pray than the Lord Jesus, who is both fully human and fully God.
[1788.44 → 1793.44] Right? As the son of Mary, like Mary, his mother, he is fully human.
[1793.44 → 1796.44] He was born in a manger.
[1796.44 → 1800.44] He grew up as a child running and crying and playing.
[1800.44 → 1805.44] He knows all about life, doesn't he?
[1805.44 → 1807.44] He knows what it's like to be one of us.
[1807.44 → 1808.44] Right?
[1808.44 → 1817.44] He knows what it means to be a human being in this broken world, with all the challenges, all the joys that we all face.
[1817.44 → 1822.44] And in particular, he knows what it means to pray as a human being.
[1822.44 → 1826.44] So we see this amazing verse in Hebrews chapter five.
[1826.44 → 1832.44] It says, during the days of Jesus's life on earth.
[1832.44 → 1834.44] Right? This is his whole life on earth.
[1834.44 → 1842.44] He offered up prayers and petitions with reverent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death.
[1842.44 → 1848.44] So in particular, I think it's referring to the prayer of Semi before his death, but also says during the days of his life.
[1848.44 → 1854.44] So not just that one time, but it's a picture of Jesus offering up prayers and petitions to God.
[1854.44 → 1860.44] And so as one of us, as a God who has become man, he knows what we need.
[1860.44 → 1861.44] That's the main point.
[1861.44 → 1865.44] And he knows because he needed it too.
[1865.44 → 1868.44] He offered up prayers to God.
[1868.44 → 1874.44] And so when Jesus teaches us to pray, he's teaching us from his own experience.
[1874.44 → 1877.44] He's teaching us from his own need.
[1877.44 → 1880.44] He's not kind of giving us an abstract academic exercise.
[1880.44 → 1883.44] He's like, let me teach you how to pray.
[1883.44 → 1884.44] And so because I pray too.
[1884.44 → 1886.44] This is how I pray to my father.
[1886.44 → 1889.44] But Jesus is not only fully man.
[1889.44 → 1890.44] He's also fully God.
[1890.44 → 1896.44] As the son of God, he knows the mind and the heart of the father.
[1896.44 → 1903.44] As one with the father, he knows what pleases the father.
[1903.44 → 1907.44] Because what pleases the father also pleases him.
[1907.44 → 1912.44] And he knows what are the father's passions and what the father cares about.
[1912.44 → 1915.44] Because those are the things that he cares about.
[1915.44 → 1926.44] And friends, that means in the Lord's prayer, when Jesus teaches us this prayer, he's teaching us a prayer that reveals to us the heart of our father.
[1926.44 → 1933.44] And so when you look at these words, when you read the Lord's prayer, you know, it's sometimes where it's so easy.
[1933.44 → 1935.44] We're so familiar with it, right?
[1935.44 → 1939.44] That we often can just rattle it off without really thinking about it.
[1939.44 → 1948.44] But what we need to realize is that these words are the priorities and the concerns that make God's heart tick.
[1948.44 → 1950.44] This is what gets God excited.
[1950.44 → 1952.44] This is what makes his heart beat.
[1952.44 → 1968.44] And friends, that should cause us to stop and to wonder and to be filled with kind of this holy sense of wonder that we are, that Jesus is revealing to us the heart of God.
[1968.44 → 1971.44] You know, what does it mean for us?
[1971.44 → 1977.44] Well, what it means is, you know, when we pray, sometimes, if you're anything like me, sometimes I'll pray, and I'm praying for things.
[1977.44 → 1981.44] And I wonder, well, is this prayer pleasing to God?
[1981.44 → 1983.44] Is this what God wants me to pray about?
[1983.44 → 1992.44] But when we use the Lord's prayer as the model for our own prayers, we can be sure that this is exactly what pleases God.
[1992.44 → 1994.44] This is what he wants us to pray for.
[1994.44 → 1999.44] Because Jesus is saying, look, I know the heart of the Father.
[1999.44 → 2001.44] I know what he cares about.
[2001.44 → 2003.44] I know what really matters to him.
[2003.44 → 2005.44] That his name be honoured.
[2005.44 → 2007.44] Right? That his kingdom come.
[2007.44 → 2008.44] That his will be done.
[2008.44 → 2013.44] That we, as his children, would be provided for everything that we need.
[2013.44 → 2018.44] That our relationships with one another would be healed and restored.
[2018.44 → 2021.44] That we would be delivered from evil.
[2021.44 → 2022.44] Right?
[2022.44 → 2024.44] Jesus knows our true needs.
[2024.44 → 2027.44] And he knows the Father's deepest desires.
[2027.44 → 2030.44] And in this Lord's prayer, he's bringing them together.
[2030.44 → 2033.44] Okay, so that is the fount of the prayer.
[2033.44 → 2035.44] The teacher of the prayer is the Lord Jesus.
[2035.44 → 2037.44] Then here's the second observation.
[2037.44 → 2039.44] The flow of the prayer.
[2039.44 → 2044.44] And you might have noticed that this prayer has two halves.
[2044.44 → 2046.44] Petitions.
[2046.44 → 2049.44] So what we're looking at today is our Father in heaven.
[2049.44 → 2050.44] That's the address.
[2050.44 → 2052.44] And then there are six petitions.
[2052.44 → 2056.44] And the first three petitions are one section.
[2056.44 → 2060.44] And then there's petitions four, five, and six, which is the second half.
[2060.44 → 2062.44] Petitions one to three are,
[2062.44 → 2063.44] Hallowed be your name.
[2063.44 → 2064.44] Your kingdom come.
[2064.44 → 2065.44] Your will be done.
[2065.44 → 2068.44] Petitions four, five, and six are,
[2068.44 → 2070.44] Give us today our daily bread.
[2070.44 → 2073.44] Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[2073.44 → 2076.44] Lead us not to temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[2076.44 → 2082.44] And there are two different halves because there are two different sets of pronouns.
[2082.44 → 2087.44] The first three petitions use the pronoun your.
[2087.44 → 2091.44] And the second three use us.
[2091.44 → 2094.44] So it's your, your, your.
[2094.44 → 2097.44] Us, us, us.
[2097.44 → 2100.44] Your name, your kingdom, your will.
[2100.44 → 2102.44] Give us.
[2102.44 → 2103.44] Forgive us.
[2103.44 → 2105.44] Lead us.
[2105.44 → 2107.44] Okay, now why is this important?
[2107.44 → 2112.44] It's because Jesus is prioritizing our needs.
[2112.44 → 2116.44] Do you and I need to eat?
[2116.44 → 2117.44] Yes.
[2117.44 → 2118.44] Yes.
[2118.44 → 2119.44] Amen.
[2119.44 → 2122.44] Do we need forgiveness?
[2122.44 → 2123.44] Yes.
[2123.44 → 2126.44] Do we need to forgive?
[2126.44 → 2128.44] Okay, you didn't hesitate.
[2128.44 → 2129.44] That's good.
[2129.44 → 2133.44] Do we need guidance and deliverance?
[2133.44 → 2134.44] Yeah.
[2134.44 → 2135.44] Right.
[2135.44 → 2140.44] Jesus teaches us to pray for such needs as these.
[2140.44 → 2150.44] But Jesus is suggesting to us that we have much greater needs even than those things that he invites us to pray for.
[2150.44 → 2151.44] Really?
[2151.44 → 2154.44] More so than food?
[2154.44 → 2155.44] Forgiveness?
[2155.44 → 2156.44] Yeah.
[2156.44 → 2163.44] We need for the Father's name to be honoured in us, in our lives, and in this world.
[2163.44 → 2165.44] That's what we need.
[2165.44 → 2169.44] We need God's kingdom to come in our lives and in this world.
[2169.44 → 2172.44] We need his will to be done in our lives and in this world.
[2172.44 → 2176.44] And sometimes we go to God in prayer, and we pray for all the things that we need.
[2176.44 → 2181.44] But what happens is sometimes, you know, we come to God in prayer.
[2181.44 → 2185.44] We come with him, to him, with all the needs in our hearts.
[2185.44 → 2188.44] We need God to provide for us.
[2188.44 → 2191.44] We need to be forgiven of our sins.
[2191.44 → 2195.44] We need wisdom for guidance in this life.
[2195.44 → 2202.44] We come to him with our needs, and we pray to God for all the things that he invites us to pray for.
[2202.44 → 2208.44] But what happens is, in my experience, we still kind of come away feeling the burden of those things.
[2208.44 → 2211.44] We feel the weight of our needs.
[2211.44 → 2215.44] And the reason is, I think, it's because we're focusing on us and not God.
[2215.44 → 2218.44] Does that make sense?
[2218.44 → 2224.44] But the flow of Jesus' prayer is your and then us.
[2224.44 → 2231.44] And so we focus on the request, your name be honoured, your kingdom come, your will be done.
[2231.44 → 2234.44] It puts our needs in perspective.
[2234.44 → 2239.44] And we learn how to trust him with all the stuff of our lives.
[2239.44 → 2242.44] As we pray this movement, this flow of the prayer.
[2242.44 → 2250.44] And actually, when we do that, what happens is the US requests become lifted and absorbed into the requests.
[2250.44 → 2253.44] And actually, the US requests are taken care of in the first three.
[2253.44 → 2261.44] When we pray for God's name to be honoured and his kingdom and will to be done, we're praying for our needs as well.
[2261.44 → 2263.44] Because that's his will.
[2263.44 → 2265.44] Because he cares for us.
[2265.44 → 2272.44] And so, I think this is so helpful that when we pray to God, we can come with him for our needs.
[2272.44 → 2274.44] But we start with God.
[2274.44 → 2279.44] And in doing that, we won't still feel so weighted and burdened by the needs that we have.
[2279.44 → 2283.44] We can trust in our Heavenly Father.
[2283.44 → 2286.44] So that's the fount of the prayer and the flow of the prayer.
[2286.44 → 2293.44] And those are some kind of initial observations about the Lord's Prayer that I think can be helpful for us.
[2293.44 → 2295.44] But now, friends, let's look at the prayer itself.
[2295.44 → 2297.44] I hope you're ready.
[2297.44 → 2299.44] Our Father in Heaven.
[2299.44 → 2301.44] Okay, our Father in Heaven.
[2301.44 → 2308.44] First thing Jesus does in teaching us to pray is to address God as our Father.
[2308.44 → 2309.44] Why is that important?
[2309.44 → 2319.44] It's because in teaching us to pray our Father, he's teaching us not so much about how we should think of God,
[2319.44 → 2323.44] but instead how God thinks of us.
[2323.44 → 2324.44] Okay?
[2324.44 → 2325.44] How God thinks of us.
[2325.44 → 2327.44] That's far more important.
[2327.44 → 2333.44] Jesus teaches us to pray to God as our Father because God has made us his children.
[2333.44 → 2337.44] When he looks at us, he sees us as his children.
[2337.44 → 2339.44] I love how C.S. Lewis puts it.
[2339.44 → 2341.44] He says,
[2341.44 → 2352.44] To please God, to be loved by God, not merely pitied, but delighted in as a father in a son.
[2352.44 → 2357.44] It seems impossible, a weight or burden of glory which our thoughts can hardly sustain.
[2357.44 → 2360.44] But so it is.
[2360.44 → 2363.44] So do you hear what he's saying here?
[2363.44 → 2364.44] What C.S. Lewis is saying?
[2364.44 → 2365.44] He's saying,
[2365.44 → 2366.44] Friends, listen.
[2366.44 → 2369.44] You please God.
[2369.44 → 2374.44] I think that's enough for us just to meditate on alone this morning.
[2374.44 → 2377.44] And I want you to know that.
[2377.44 → 2379.44] You please God.
[2379.44 → 2381.44] It's amazing.
[2381.44 → 2382.44] You make God happy.
[2382.44 → 2386.44] You make God happy.
[2386.44 → 2387.44] He loves you.
[2387.44 → 2393.44] He delights in you as a good father delights in his son or daughter.
[2393.44 → 2395.44] That's what God thinks of you.
[2395.44 → 2396.44] It's not.
[2396.44 → 2398.44] It's important for what we think of God, right?
[2398.44 → 2403.44] We need to learn how to see our God as our Heavenly Father.
[2403.44 → 2413.44] But according to C.S. Lewis, far more important is to know how God sees us.
[2413.44 → 2415.44] And I love how what he says here.
[2415.44 → 2419.44] It seems a weight of glory which our thoughts can hardly sustain.
[2419.44 → 2422.44] You know how we say that today?
[2422.44 → 2424.44] It's mind-blowing.
[2424.44 → 2426.44] Mind blowing.
[2426.44 → 2428.44] Our hearts can hardly sustain.
[2428.44 → 2430.44] That's poetic, but...
[2430.44 → 2431.44] Right?
[2431.44 → 2432.44] Mind blowing.
[2432.44 → 2433.44] Mind blowing.
[2433.44 → 2435.44] The way God sees us.
[2435.44 → 2438.44] So God, friends, is not some disconnected deity.
[2438.44 → 2442.44] He's not the Star Wars force of the universe.
[2442.44 → 2444.44] He is our Father.
[2444.44 → 2445.44] Our personal Father.
[2445.44 → 2448.44] That's how God thinks of us.
[2448.44 → 2455.44] And one writer says that what separates our God, the living God, from all the gods that
[2455.44 → 2460.44] people have worshipped around the world throughout the centuries, is this very point.
[2460.44 → 2462.44] That he relates to us as a Heavenly Father.
[2462.44 → 2464.44] That is absolutely unique.
[2464.44 → 2470.44] There's much to admire about Islam, but Islam has 99 names for God.
[2470.44 → 2473.44] Many of them biblical, but not one of them is Father.
[2473.44 → 2478.44] There is a book that came out a couple of decades ago, but it's fairly well known.
[2478.44 → 2480.44] It's called, I Dare to Call Him Father.
[2480.44 → 2487.44] It's about a Pakistani woman who's a Muslim, who the gospel is shared with her, and a doctor,
[2487.44 → 2492.44] a medical, a missionary doctor, invites her to pray to God as Father.
[2492.44 → 2494.44] And it changes everything.
[2494.44 → 2495.44] She becomes a Christian.
[2495.44 → 2501.44] She says, I Dare to call God Father.
[2501.44 → 2507.44] And in the Greek religions, which were the very, which were just so very popular and widespread,
[2507.44 → 2513.44] in the first century, when Jesus was teaching this prayer, there was the poet Homer.
[2513.44 → 2517.44] Homer wrote of Zeus as a father.
[2517.44 → 2520.44] He would talk about Zeus' father, the Godfather.
[2520.44 → 2524.44] But what kind of father was he?
[2524.44 → 2526.44] What kind of father was Zeus?
[2526.44 → 2529.44] Well, there's the famous story of Prometheus.
[2529.44 → 2534.44] Prometheus comes from the realm of the gods, and he comes to live among humans.
[2534.44 → 2538.44] But what happens when Prometheus comes and lives among humans?
[2538.44 → 2542.44] He discovers that our lives are terrible.
[2542.44 → 2550.44] He finds people living in caves, shivering because of the cold, because there's no fire,
[2550.44 → 2557.44] dying of starvation, hunted by wild beasts, the most miserable of all living creatures.
[2557.44 → 2564.44] If they only had fire, Prometheus said to himself, they could at least warm themselves, cook their food,
[2564.44 → 2569.44] use it to build tools, make tools that they can use to build houses.
[2569.44 → 2576.44] So Prometheus went boldly to Zeus and begged him to give fire to people.
[2576.44 → 2582.44] I will not, said Zeus, not one spark will I give them.
[2582.44 → 2591.44] So Prometheus, he sneaks up back into the realm of the gods, steals fire from Zeus and gives it to humans.
[2591.44 → 2598.44] And he teaches them how to build a fire to warm themselves and how to cook their food and how to make tools to build houses.
[2598.44 → 2603.44] Well, one day Zeus looks down on earth and sees fires burning.
[2603.44 → 2607.44] And it didn't take him long to realize what had happened.
[2607.44 → 2611.44] That Prometheus had disobeyed him and had given fire to humans.
[2611.44 → 2614.44] And how do you think Zeus felt about that?
[2614.44 → 2616.44] He was furious.
[2616.44 → 2621.44] That Prometheus would think humans to be worthy of fire.
[2621.44 → 2626.44] And so Zeus punishes Prometheus by tying him to the side of a mountain.
[2626.44 → 2637.44] Okay, that's the way the people of the ancient Greco-Roman world where Jesus and the disciples lived.
[2637.44 → 2640.44] That's what they would think about the God who is Zeus.
[2640.44 → 2643.44] And by contrast, Jesus says,
[2643.44 → 2649.44] Our God, the one true and living God, relates to us completely differently.
[2649.44 → 2652.44] Unheard of, unfathomable.
[2652.44 → 2656.44] That we can call God a good father.
[2656.44 → 2663.44] And that this God loves you and cares about you and has compassion on you.
[2663.44 → 2673.44] And has so much concern for the sin in your life and the pain in your life that goes well beyond even what a good earthly father has.
[2673.44 → 2674.44] Right?
[2674.44 → 2676.44] He is our father.
[2676.44 → 2685.44] And because God is our father, what this means for us is that we, in prayer, can come before God with bold requests.
[2685.44 → 2689.44] So again, something I learned from Daryl Johnson is this.
[2689.44 → 2693.44] He says we need to look at the verbs of this prayer.
[2693.44 → 2696.44] So here's a little bit of grammar.
[2696.44 → 2702.44] The verbs in the prayer are in the imperative mood.
[2702.44 → 2704.44] Okay, the verbs in the prayer are in the imperative mood.
[2704.44 → 2705.44] Well, what does that mean?
[2705.44 → 2706.44] What's imperative mean?
[2706.44 → 2707.44] Command.
[2707.44 → 2708.44] Right?
[2708.44 → 2711.44] They're verbs of command.
[2711.44 → 2714.44] Like, do this, do that.
[2714.44 → 2716.44] It's like talking to my kids.
[2716.44 → 2719.44] Pick up that.
[2719.44 → 2721.44] Be this, fix that.
[2721.44 → 2723.44] They're commands.
[2723.44 → 2735.44] And the thing about this is, in the ancient Greco-Roman world, you would never, ever command a superior, would you?
[2735.44 → 2737.44] Culturally unheard of.
[2737.44 → 2741.44] Even in our day, maybe less unheard of, but certainly understandable.
[2741.44 → 2746.44] You know, we don't go into our boss's office and tell the boss what to do.
[2746.44 → 2753.44] You know, and our kids, our grandchildren, hopefully they don't come up to us and say, Dad, give me this.
[2753.44 → 2756.44] Grandma, give me that.
[2756.44 → 2757.44] Right?
[2757.44 → 2761.44] And if they would, if they did that, we would say, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2761.44 → 2764.44] You know, you need to speak more politely.
[2764.44 → 2766.44] You need to say, please.
[2766.44 → 2767.44] Right?
[2767.44 → 2768.44] You can't just demand.
[2768.44 → 2770.44] We would say that to them.
[2770.44 → 2772.44] Because you never use the imperative.
[2772.44 → 2775.44] You never command a superior.
[2775.44 → 2777.44] It's completely uncalled-for.
[2777.44 → 2781.44] But in the Lord's Prayer, what's happening here?
[2781.44 → 2784.44] Are we addressing a superior?
[2784.44 → 2785.44] Yeah.
[2785.44 → 2790.44] The superior above all superiors, right?
[2790.44 → 2792.44] Our Father in heaven.
[2792.44 → 2795.44] And what does Jesus tell us to do?
[2795.44 → 2797.44] Use the imperative.
[2797.44 → 2802.44] Hallow your name.
[2802.44 → 2803.44] Right?
[2803.44 → 2805.44] Bring your kingdom.
[2805.44 → 2807.44] Do your will.
[2807.44 → 2808.44] Right?
[2808.44 → 2810.44] We're not just asking, we're commanding it.
[2810.44 → 2812.44] Do it, God.
[2812.44 → 2813.44] Do it.
[2813.44 → 2815.44] Fix it.
[2815.44 → 2817.44] Give me.
[2817.44 → 2819.44] All of these things.
[2821.44 → 2824.44] How does that make you feel?
[2825.44 → 2826.44] Maybe a little nervous?
[2826.44 → 2829.44] Very bold, right?
[2829.44 → 2831.44] This is very bold.
[2831.44 → 2835.44] But remember who is teaching us how to pray this prayer.
[2837.44 → 2838.44] Jesus.
[2838.44 → 2840.44] Jesus has the heart and mind of God.
[2840.44 → 2842.44] Jesus knows what pleases the Father.
[2842.44 → 2850.44] And he is telling us that his Father invites his children to come into his presence and use the imperative.
[2850.44 → 2855.44] And he doesn't even say, make sure you say please.
[2855.44 → 2856.44] Right?
[2856.44 → 2859.44] He wants us to come and pray that boldly because he's a good Father.
[2859.44 → 2872.44] You know, and I know, you know, and we have to say when we talk about God as Father that, you know, some of us, we have struggles with this language about calling God Father.
[2872.44 → 2873.44] Because we haven't had good fathers.
[2873.44 → 2875.44] Because we haven't had good fathers.
[2875.44 → 2878.44] A lot of us have had rough relationships with our fathers.
[2878.44 → 2881.44] And so this image of a father can be hard.
[2881.44 → 2889.44] But what we need to realize is that God isn't searching for some analogy and looking at human fathers and saying, well, that's what I'm like.
[2889.44 → 2890.44] It's the opposite.
[2890.44 → 2893.44] God is the true Father.
[2893.44 → 2898.44] And every earthly father gets that name from him.
[2898.44 → 2901.44] And we don't live up to that.
[2901.44 → 2905.44] But what is the true image is our Heavenly Father.
[2905.44 → 2911.44] And the Father in this prayer is the Father that Jesus knows and loves.
[2911.44 → 2913.44] And we can trust him.
[2913.44 → 2914.44] Right?
[2914.44 → 2921.44] This is the Father that Jesus clung to and looked to and loved and had intimacy with.
[2921.44 → 2927.44] And amazingly, we are invited to address God in the exact same way.
[2927.44 → 2929.44] He is our Father too.
[2929.44 → 2932.44] So, you know, I like this image of being a tag along.
[2932.44 → 2933.44] Jesus is our older brother.
[2933.44 → 2937.44] You know if you've ever had a younger sibling, what do they do?
[2937.44 → 2942.44] Just kind of follow you around, do what you want to, you know, want to do what you do.
[2942.44 → 2948.44] And with us, with Jesus, as our older brother, we get to tag along.
[2948.44 → 2952.44] We get to call God our Father.
[2952.44 → 2959.44] And that leads us to the second part of the address, our last point today, that he is our Father in Heaven.
[2959.44 → 2962.44] In Heaven has two things to point out.
[2962.44 → 2967.44] One, it means very close.
[2967.44 → 2970.44] It's a little bit counterintuitive to us.
[2970.44 → 2976.44] But actually, when we say in Heaven, what it means is very, very close to us.
[2976.44 → 2980.44] You know, for many of us, when we think about Heaven, what do we think?
[2980.44 → 2982.44] Very far away.
[2982.44 → 2983.44] Right?
[2983.44 → 2987.44] We might even think, gosh, you know, our Father is in Heaven.
[2987.44 → 2989.44] You know, how do we pray?
[2989.44 → 2991.44] We've got to yell really loud, right?
[2991.44 → 2992.44] We've got to shout.
[2992.44 → 2993.44] How is he going to hear us?
[2993.44 → 2995.44] He's so far away.
[2995.44 → 2997.44] But not for Jesus.
[2997.44 → 3000.44] For Jesus, Heaven is another dimension.
[3000.44 → 3003.44] It's the dimension in which God lives.
[3003.44 → 3004.44] And where is that dimension?
[3004.44 → 3005.44] It is here.
[3005.44 → 3013.44] Heaven is the dimension in which God lives that is intersecting with where we are.
[3013.44 → 3014.44] It is interfusing it.
[3014.44 → 3016.44] It is sustaining it.
[3016.44 → 3017.44] Right?
[3017.44 → 3021.44] We believe that God not only created the world, that he sustains it by his power.
[3021.44 → 3026.44] If he was to remove his presence, his hand, everything would unravel.
[3026.44 → 3028.44] God is here.
[3028.44 → 3030.44] He is everywhere.
[3030.44 → 3033.44] Heaven is interfused with earth.
[3033.44 → 3038.44] Heaven is as real and close to us as the air we breathe.
[3038.44 → 3042.44] That's why going to Heaven doesn't take very long.
[3042.44 → 3043.44] Right?
[3043.44 → 3044.44] Like that.
[3044.44 → 3045.44] Blink of an eye.
[3045.44 → 3047.44] Passing.
[3047.44 → 3049.44] Just to this other side.
[3049.44 → 3050.44] That we can't see.
[3050.44 → 3052.44] But is there.
[3052.44 → 3056.44] So the Father to whom we pray is very close.
[3056.44 → 3057.44] You know, I forget who.
[3057.44 → 3063.44] Some theologians said God is as close to us, or closer to us, as we are to ourselves.
[3063.44 → 3066.44] He's right here.
[3066.44 → 3068.44] He's close.
[3068.44 → 3073.44] And in Heaven, it also means, secondly, on the throne.
[3073.44 → 3078.44] Some of the songs we sang this morning talked about God on his throne.
[3078.44 → 3083.44] And so for Jesus, Heaven is God's throne and earth his footstool.
[3083.44 → 3086.44] That's what he said just a couple of verses ahead of this.
[3086.44 → 3088.44] Heaven is God's throne.
[3088.44 → 3091.44] Earth is his footstool.
[3091.44 → 3092.44] Psalm 123 says,
[3092.44 → 3099.44] I lift my eyes to you who sit enthroned in Heaven.
[3099.44 → 3102.44] Our Father in Heaven.
[3102.44 → 3103.44] He's enthroned.
[3103.44 → 3105.44] He is the King.
[3105.44 → 3107.44] And friends, why is this important?
[3107.44 → 3114.44] Because if that were not the case, what's prayer?
[3114.44 → 3116.44] But wishful thinking?
[3116.44 → 3117.44] A futile exercise?
[3117.44 → 3118.44] Maybe therapeutic.
[3118.44 → 3124.44] But ultimately, if God is not on his throne, what can he do?
[3124.44 → 3126.44] He can say, I'll do my best.
[3126.44 → 3128.44] I'll try if I can.
[3128.44 → 3129.44] Right?
[3129.44 → 3132.44] But no, God is on his throne.
[3132.44 → 3143.44] That means that when we pray to God, we have real hope that he can do, he is able to do, he is strong enough to accomplish all that he teaches us to ask for.
[3143.44 → 3144.44] He can do it.
[3144.44 → 3145.44] Right?
[3145.44 → 3147.44] He isn't like our earthly fathers.
[3147.44 → 3148.44] He rules over creation.
[3148.44 → 3152.44] He is in charge of the entire cosmos.
[3152.44 → 3153.44] Right?
[3153.44 → 3157.44] He calls into being all things by the word of his power.
[3157.44 → 3159.44] He is your heavenly Father.
[3159.44 → 3166.44] And because that's who he is, then the one to whom we pray can do something about our prayers.
[3166.44 → 3171.44] And so the second thing we need to know also about these verbs in the Lord's Prayer,
[3171.44 → 3179.44] is that not only are they in the imperative mood, command, but they are in the passive voice.
[3179.44 → 3181.44] Why in the passive voice?
[3181.44 → 3186.44] Friends, because who's doing it?
[3186.44 → 3187.44] God.
[3187.44 → 3189.44] If it was active voice, who would be doing it?
[3189.44 → 3190.44] Us.
[3190.44 → 3192.44] But we can't do it.
[3192.44 → 3193.44] So it's in the passive voice.
[3193.44 → 3195.44] And friends, this is absolutely key.
[3195.44 → 3197.44] Only God can do it.
[3197.44 → 3200.44] Only God can hallow his name.
[3200.44 → 3203.44] Only God can make his kingdom come.
[3203.44 → 3206.44] Only God can make his will be done.
[3206.44 → 3209.44] And we need to listen.
[3209.44 → 3220.44] The way we typically think about these prayers is we say, God, may you help me hallow your name.
[3220.44 → 3221.44] Right?
[3221.44 → 3226.44] God, would you let us bring your kingdom?
[3226.44 → 3229.44] Help us to accomplish your will.
[3229.44 → 3232.44] That's not what Jesus is teaching us.
[3232.44 → 3234.44] We are not the ones to do it.
[3234.44 → 3236.44] God is the one to do it.
[3236.44 → 3238.44] We are not the subject of the verb.
[3238.44 → 3240.44] God is the subject of the verb.
[3240.44 → 3241.44] Only God can do it.
[3241.44 → 3242.44] God can do it.
[3242.44 → 3246.44] So the prayer is, Father, you do it.
[3246.44 → 3248.44] We can't do it.
[3248.44 → 3249.44] You do it.
[3249.44 → 3252.44] You hallow your name.
[3252.44 → 3253.44] Command.
[3253.44 → 3254.44] Passive.
[3254.44 → 3255.44] Hallow your name.
[3255.44 → 3257.44] You hallow your name.
[3257.44 → 3260.44] You bring your kingdom.
[3260.44 → 3264.44] You do your will, God.
[3264.44 → 3265.44] Only God can do it.
[3265.44 → 3267.44] Only God can do it.
[3267.44 → 3269.44] Who's on the throne?
[3269.44 → 3270.44] Not me.
[3270.44 → 3271.44] Not you.
[3271.44 → 3274.44] God is on the throne.
[3274.44 → 3275.44] God can do it.
[3275.44 → 3279.44] How does that make you feel?
[3279.44 → 3289.44] You know, when I think about that, we don't have to pray, okay, your kingdom, this huge thing, your kingdom, I have to bring it.
[3289.44 → 3290.44] How am I going to do that?
[3290.44 → 3292.44] I don't have to.
[3292.44 → 3296.44] It's a huge weight that's lifted off our shoulders.
[3296.44 → 3297.44] We don't have to bring the kingdom.
[3297.44 → 3299.44] We don't have to accomplish God's will.
[3299.44 → 3303.44] We don't have to make sure his name is hallowed in the earth.
[3303.44 → 3305.44] God will do it.
[3305.44 → 3307.44] We just pray, God, do it.
[3307.44 → 3309.44] Would you do it?
[3311.44 → 3313.44] This is our Heavenly Father.
[3313.44 → 3315.44] That he is, he is, I mean, he is God.
[3315.44 → 3317.44] He is the creator.
[3317.44 → 3318.44] He is the sustainer.
[3318.44 → 3319.44] He is the redeemer.
[3319.44 → 3326.44] He is above us and beyond us in all ways, and yet, amazingly close at hand.
[3326.44 → 3330.44] And he, friends, has chosen to become our Father.
[3330.44 → 3334.44] He has chosen us to be his children.
[3334.44 → 3348.44] He has wooed us and called us and loved us and adopted us as his own, not because of us, not because of any, thinking about children, cuteness in ourselves, any good behaviour in us.
[3348.44 → 3350.44] Because of his mercy.
[3350.44 → 3358.44] We were orphans without a spiritual home in terrible situation.
[3358.44 → 3362.44] He brought us to himself, into his arms, into his home.
[3362.44 → 3368.44] The apostle John later, bass in the wonder of this.
[3368.44 → 3370.44] This is what he says in 1 John 3.
[3370.44 → 3378.44] He says, see what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God.
[3378.44 → 3380.44] And that is what we are.
[3380.44 → 3392.44] And so what happened is that Jesus, the Son, the eternal Son of God, who was in heaven, came to earth to bring us into a relationship with God the Father.
[3392.44 → 3404.44] So that we, like Jesus, our heavenly, our brother, would know God in the same way, would love God in the same way, would trust God in the same way that Jesus does.
[3404.44 → 3407.44] And how does he make this possible for us?
[3407.44 → 3408.44] He lived for us.
[3408.44 → 3409.44] He died for us.
[3409.44 → 3416.44] He redeemed us so that he could call us to himself, to be one with him, united to our Father.
[3416.44 → 3425.44] And then he makes this all possible by giving us the Holy Spirit, the same Spirit whom Paul calls the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry what?
[3426.44 → 3428.44] Abba, Father.
[3430.44 → 3432.44] So let's pray to our Father together.
[3436.44 → 3437.44] Father,
[3437.44 → 3460.44] I thank you for the great privilege to strut into your throne room, to come and even sit in your lap, be held by you, to be cherished and loved by you,
[3460.44 → 3477.44] and to tell you exactly what is on our hearts, to even ask with great boldness, even to the extent of commanding in our request to you.
[3477.44 → 3489.44] And Father, would this great reality that is often so veiled from our understanding and our hearts, Lord, would you help us to live into the fullness of you?
[3489.44 → 3497.44] And Lord, teach us what it means that we can pray our Father in heaven.
[3498.44 → 3501.44] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[3502.44 → 3512.44] And before I forget, before we sing our next song, is that not only do we want to study the Lord's Prayer and learn more about it, unpack it,
[3512.44 → 3519.44] but also, one of the things I hope we will do is learn how to be people of prayer, to practice this prayer.
[3520.44 → 3526.44] So I know it's a little bit short notice, but tonight, on Zoom, I sent the link in the email.
[3526.44 → 3528.44] If you don't have it, do come talk to me.
[3528.44 → 3533.44] But I want to invite anyone who is available and interested to come on Zoom with me.
[3533.44 → 3540.44] It's going to give us an opportunity to kind of hear from one another about how we understand and what this means to us,
[3540.44 → 3542.44] that we can pray our Father in heaven.
[3542.44 → 3547.44] And then each week, just during the time of this series, we're going to practice praying each petition
[3547.44 → 3551.44] and learn how we can make this as a model of our own prayers.
[3551.44 → 3559.44] So you're invited, not obligatory, but you're invited at 7 o'clock, just, you know, 45 minutes or so, on Zoom,
[3559.44 → 3562.44] and we will pray together, and we'll talk about this together.
[3562.44 → 3564.44] Thanks.
[3592.44 → 3605.46] Thank you.
[3622.44 → 3625.78] Everything to God in prayer
[3625.78 → 3632.68] If we trials and temptations
[3632.68 → 3636.94] Is there trouble anywhere
[3636.94 → 3643.44] We should never be discouraged
[3643.44 → 3648.68] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[3648.68 → 3655.44] Can we find a friend so faithful
[3655.44 → 3661.38] Who will all our sorrows share
[3661.38 → 3667.72] Jesus knows our every weakness
[3667.72 → 3673.68] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[3673.68 → 3680.44] Are we weak and heavy laden
[3680.44 → 3686.38] Numbered breath, O Lord, of care
[3686.38 → 3692.44] Precious Saviour, steal our refuge
[3692.44 → 3698.32] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[3698.32 → 3705.08] Do your friends despise for the Saviour
[3705.08 → 3710.32] Take it to the Lord in prayer
[3710.32 → 3717.08] In His arms to take and shield you
[3717.08 → 3722.84] You will find us all this day
[3722.84 → 3741.12] Please join me in a prayer of supplication
[3741.12 → 3749.48] Our Heavenly Father
[3749.48 → 3754.02] When we think of calling you Father
[3754.02 → 3757.00] Lord, we are amazed
[3757.00 → 3761.38] We've often thought of you as impersonal
[3761.38 → 3762.44] Or distant
[3762.44 → 3766.70] Lord, we have treated you as a magic genie
[3766.70 → 3769.64] Only coming to you with our wishes
[3769.64 → 3773.20] But Lord, you invite us to call you Father
[3773.20 → 3776.96] Father, we feel excited
[3776.96 → 3778.90] Amazed
[3778.90 → 3780.42] Maybe even a little bit unsure
[3780.42 → 3782.62] Of what that means
[3782.62 → 3786.46] That you want this personal relationship with us
[3786.46 → 3789.60] So Lord, would you show us more of who you are
[3789.60 → 3790.94] And what you're like
[3790.94 → 3794.28] Open each one of our hearts
[3794.28 → 3795.68] To experience your love
[3795.68 → 3797.62] In a way that we can understand
[3797.62 → 3800.50] Father, we thank you
[3800.50 → 3805.80] For the revelations of your word
[3805.80 → 3807.76] That through your spirit
[3807.76 → 3809.42] Also changes our hearts
[3809.42 → 3811.40] It changes how we feel about you
[3811.40 → 3815.68] Lord, we pray for
[3815.68 → 3820.24] Also the needs of our world
[3820.24 → 3822.86] As we think about fathers
[3822.86 → 3825.88] Lord, many people in this world
[3825.88 → 3829.32] Do not have an earthly father
[3829.32 → 3830.70] Who loves and cares for them
[3830.70 → 3834.20] Father, to them would you be
[3834.20 → 3836.18] The true and real father
[3836.18 → 3841.14] Lord, for those whom we know and love
[3841.14 → 3842.42] Who don't know you
[3842.42 → 3845.32] As their Heavenly Father
[3845.32 → 3849.46] Lord, would you reveal yourself to them as such
[3849.46 → 3852.66] And Lord, when we have opportunity
[3852.66 → 3855.88] To give the reason for the hope that is within us
[3855.88 → 3859.56] Lord, would we teach them
[3859.56 → 3861.40] That they can pray to God
[3861.40 → 3864.56] As their Heavenly Father
[3864.56 → 3868.10] And that as they do so, Lord
[3868.10 → 3870.70] That you buy your spirit would work in their hearts
[3870.70 → 3874.22] Would soften them
[3874.22 → 3877.84] In faith to know and to trust you
[3877.84 → 3882.40] Father, we also pray for the needs of this world
[3882.40 → 3885.78] And for those who
[3885.78 → 3889.00] Today in the Sanctity of Life Sunday
[3889.00 → 3893.74] Lord, need help
