[268.44 → 274.98] Welcome to our worship service at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[274.98 → 279.78] We're happy that you could be with us today, whether you're in person or on YouTube.
[279.78 → 281.60] You're welcome.
[281.60 → 286.84] If you're a visitor, we're especially pleased that you're worshipping with us today.
[286.84 → 291.50] And please join us for coffee or tea after the service in the fellowship hall, which is
[291.50 → 295.00] directly out the doors there.
[295.00 → 300.54] I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader for part of this service.
[300.54 → 305.48] Today is Family Worship Sunday, and we'll be celebrating the Lord's Supper together with
[305.48 → 307.08] our friends from the Chinese ministry.
[307.08 → 313.62] And there will also be a children's message for the younger members of the church.
[313.62 → 320.10] And Pastor Jason will continue his Advent series, The Mothers of Jesus, focusing his sermon today
[320.10 → 320.96] on Ruth.
[320.96 → 332.00] Here we're mailing on Ruth.
[332.00 → 337.38] cards. They're on the foyer table, so help yourself if you'd like to take some and pass
[337.38 → 341.84] them out to some people and invite them to our services, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day
[341.84 → 349.78] services. Several of you have been enjoying the coffee time on Thursday mornings during the week,
[350.48 → 356.60] and this coming week is the last one before Christmas, and it will start up again after
[356.60 → 361.64] the new year, so you're welcome to come and have a cup of coffee and usually some goodies there.
[362.00 → 369.62] In the bulletin also is an announcement that was mentioned last week about cross-training.
[369.62 → 380.12] On our last class for this next session that we're planning, there's an opportunity for people to
[380.12 → 387.40] talk about their life's lessons. What have you learned that you can share with others,
[387.40 → 393.14] and what has God done in your life? This can be a brief little something you might want to say,
[393.28 → 397.54] or you can have a little, you know, a little bit longer talk if you like, but anyway, think about
[397.54 → 403.98] that if you'd like to just pass on something in this last class that we're having that in January
[403.98 → 415.44] and February. Okay, our call to worship today comes from Philippians 4, verses 4 and 5.
[415.44 → 430.30] Okay. Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again. Rejoice. Let your gentleness be evident to all.
[431.06 → 439.06] The Lord is near. We rejoice in the hope of Christ's coming. Let us worship God.
[439.06 → 449.86] And the Lord greets us with these words from 2 Peter 1, verse 2. May grace and peace be yours in abundance,
[450.38 → 458.28] in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. As God has greeted us, so let us greet each other.
[458.28 → 460.28] Thank you.
[488.28 → 512.28] Thank you.
[512.28 → 515.06] Remain standing. We'll start with Joy to the World.

[663.06 → 667.76] And next is Light of the World, which we introduced last week.
[667.90 → 672.70] So we'll just continue singing this new song of Advent.

[694.70 → 708.78] The world waits for a miracle, a heart of arms for a little bit of hope, O God, O God, Emmanuel.
[712.78 → 723.70] A child waits for a dishonour, a child waits for a seal of hope, O God.
[723.70 → 727.74] O God, Emmanuel.
[731.74 → 749.78] And can you hear the angels sing in glory to the light of the world?
[749.78 → 759.82] Glory to the light of the world is here.
[759.82 → 767.86] The crowd breaks with the tears of a mother.
[767.86 → 771.90] The Lord is the Son of God.
[771.90 → 777.90] Come now, come now, be the light of the world.
[777.90 → 785.94] He is the Son of God.
[785.94 → 787.94] He is the Son of God.
[787.94 → 791.98] He is Messiah, the Prince of Peace.
[791.98 → 794.02] He is the Son of God.
[794.02 → 796.02] He is the Son of God.
[796.02 → 798.02] He is the Son of God.
[798.02 → 802.06] He is the Son of God.
[802.06 → 810.10] Glory to the light of the world.

[845.22 → 846.22] Glory to the Lord.
[846.22 → 851.22] Glory to the Lord.
[851.22 → 864.24] Glory to the Lord.
[864.24 → 891.46] Today is the third Sunday of Advent, and on this day we light the third candle in our
[891.46 → 899.32] Advent wreath, the candle of joy. Israel rejoiced when she was freed from exile and led back to
[899.32 → 906.86] Zion. Mary rejoiced at the news that she would carry Jesus in her womb. We rejoice because the
[906.86 → 915.56] Father has sent us his Son to deliver and reconcile us to him. Happy are they who have the God of Jacob
[915.56 → 920.42] for their help, whose hope is in the Lord their God.
[945.56 → 964.40] Holy Trinity, you are the source, the cause, and the object of our joy. Continue to stir up in us
[964.40 → 972.54] such joyful exultation for your name and glory that we cannot keep silent. May our joy compel us to
[972.54 → 979.94] proclaim your mighty works and your saving acts to the whole world, that they might know your joy also.
[979.94 → 990.10] Amen. Happy are those who have the God of Jacob for their help, whose hope is in the Lord their God.
[1002.54 → 1014.20] For our time of confession, let us confess our sin before God and one another with these words.
[1016.08 → 1026.30] Lord God, our lives are filled with sin. We forget our neighbour's needs and do not love you above all else.
[1026.30 → 1032.92] We need a Saviour. Help us to be ready for Jesus in our own hearts.
[1033.92 → 1037.40] O come, O come, Saviour of the world.
[1039.00 → 1045.50] God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of our sin is from Isaiah 40, verses 1 and 2.
[1045.50 → 1054.28] Comfort, comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Your sins are pardoned. Your penalty is paid.
[1055.24 → 1057.28] Thanks be to God.
[1057.28 → 1057.30] Thanks be to God.
[1075.50 → 1105.48] Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me, and that thou didst become to thee,
[1105.48 → 1114.22] O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
[1114.22 → 1115.14] I come.
[1117.00 → 1132.12] Just as I am without waiting not to live my soul of one dark heart,
[1132.12 → 1140.04] To leave those blood and cleanse each blood
[1140.04 → 1150.12] O Lamb of God, I come, I come
[1150.12 → 1159.12] Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
[1159.12 → 1167.12] Will welcome heart and cleanse, relieve
[1167.12 → 1175.12] Because I promise I believe
[1175.12 → 1186.12] O Lamb of God, I come, I come
[1186.12 → 1196.12] Just as I am, Thou trust about
[1196.12 → 1203.12] With many of you, with many of you, with many of you
[1203.12 → 1211.12] My dreams and fears, we live without
[1211.12 → 1223.12] O Lamb of God, I come, I come
[1223.12 → 1233.12] Amen
[1233.12 → 1249.12] Well brothers and sisters, we continue to worship the Lord on this Lord's Day by celebrating the Lord's Supper together
[1249.12 → 1257.12] And as we do so, we first confess our faith, what we believe as Christians, before we come to this table
[1257.12 → 1265.12] And our confession of faith for today comes from a contemporary testimony of our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church
[1265.12 → 1267.12] Called Our World Belongs to God
[1267.12 → 1273.12] And there is one article of the confession that teaches us about the Lord's Supper
[1273.12 → 1275.12] So let's say this together
[1275.12 → 1285.12] In the Lord's Supper, Christ offers his own crucified body and shed blood to his people and assures them a share in his death and resurrection
[1285.12 → 1295.12] By the Holy Spirit, he feeds us with his resurrection life and binds us to each other as we share one loaf and cup
[1295.12 → 1311.12] We receive this food gladly, believing as we eat that Jesus is our life, giving food and drink
[1311.12 → 1317.12] And that he will come again to the Lord's Supper and the Holy Spirit, and that he will come again to the Lord's Supper
[1317.12 → 1329.12] To call us to the wedding feast of the Lamb
[1329.12 → 1333.12] Please join me in prayer
[1333.12 → 1337.12] You are holy, O God of majesty
[1337.12 → 1341.12] And blessed is Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord
[1341.12 → 1349.12] You sent him into this world to satisfy the longings of your people for a saviour
[1349.12 → 1351.12] To bring freedom to the captives of sin
[1351.12 → 1355.12] And to establish justice for the oppressed
[1355.12 → 1359.12] He came among us as one of us
[1359.12 → 1361.12] Taking the lot of the poor
[1361.12 → 1363.12] Sharing in human suffering
[1363.12 → 1367.12] We rejoice that in his death and rising again
[1367.12 → 1371.12] You set before us the sure promise of new life
[1371.12 → 1373.12] The certain hope of a heavenly home
[1373.12 → 1377.12] Where we will sit at table with Christ our host
[1377.12 → 1379.12] Lord our God, send your Holy Spirit
[1379.12 → 1385.12] So that this bread and cup may be for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1385.12 → 1389.12] And may we with all of your saints be united with Christ
[1389.12 → 1397.12] And remain faithful in hope and in love and in joy
[1397.12 → 1399.12] We pray in Jesus name, Amen
[1399.12 → 1401.12] So friends at Christmas
[1401.12 → 1407.12] We remember, and we celebrate that Christ came
[1407.12 → 1409.12] That he took on flesh
[1409.12 → 1411.12] And that he gave us the gospel
[1411.12 → 1413.12] The gospel which is the good news
[1413.12 → 1415.12] That through Jesus Christ
[1415.12 → 1417.12] God is taking outsiders
[1417.12 → 1419.12] And making them insiders
[1419.12 → 1423.12] He is taking those of us who were formerly not his people
[1423.12 → 1425.12] And he is making us his family
[1425.12 → 1429.12] And so if you were once that outsider
[1429.12 → 1431.12] Who has come to faith in Christ
[1431.12 → 1433.12] And you trust in him as your saviour
[1433.12 → 1439.12] Then Jesus invites you to come and to feed on him
[1439.12 → 1441.12] At this table
[1441.12 → 1443.12] To feast with him
[1443.12 → 1445.12] If you are not yet a follower of Christ
[1445.12 → 1449.12] Then this table is not yet for you
[1449.12 → 1451.12] But we are so glad that you are here
[1451.12 → 1453.12] And we welcome you to remain with us
[1453.12 → 1455.12] And to continue to worship the Lord with us
[1455.12 → 1459.12] So
[1459.12 → 1463.12] Let us hear now the words of institution
[1463.12 → 1465.12] Given by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1465.12 → 1467.12] Through the Apostle Paul
[1467.12 → 1469.12] The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed
[1469.12 → 1471.12] He took bread
[1471.12 → 1473.12] And when he had given thanks to God
[1473.12 → 1474.12] He broke it
[1474.12 → 1476.12] And he said this is my body
[1476.12 → 1478.12] Which is for you
[1478.12 → 1480.12] Do this in remembrance of me
[1481.12 → 1484.12] The same way also he took the cup after supper
[1484.12 → 1487.12] Saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood
[1487.12 → 1489.12] As often as you drink it
[1489.12 → 1491.12] Do it in remembrance of me
[1491.12 → 1493.12] For as often as you eat this bread
[1493.12 → 1495.12] And you drink this cup
[1495.12 → 1497.12] You proclaim the Lord's death
[1497.12 → 1500.12] Until he comes again
[1500.12 → 1502.12] So brothers and sisters
[1502.12 → 1505.12] These are the gifts of God for you
[1505.12 → 1506.12] His people
[1506.12 → 1508.12] He welcomes you
[1508.12 → 1511.12] To feed on him by faith
[1511.12 → 1513.12] In your hearts with thanksgiving
[1513.12 → 1515.12] Trusting, knowing, believing
[1515.12 → 1517.12] That Christ died for you
[1517.12 → 1519.12] So may I
[1519.12 → 1522.12] Ask the elders and the deacons
[1522.12 → 1524.12] Who are serving to come forward at this time
[1524.12 → 1526.12] To help me distribute the elements
[1526.12 → 1528.12] To help me distribute the elements
[1556.12 → 1581.12] Let's sing together
[1581.12 → 1582.12] Let's sing together
[1582.12 → 1583.12] Let's sing together
[1583.12 → 1584.12] Let's sing together
[1584.12 → 1585.12] Let's sing together
[1585.12 → 1586.12] Let's sing together
[1586.12 → 1587.12] Let's sing together
[1587.12 → 1589.12] I hear the Saviour say
[1589.12 → 1591.12] Thy strength indeed is small
[1591.12 → 1599.12] Shall the weakness march and pray
[1599.12 → 1603.12] Find in me thy holy Lord
[1603.12 → 1605.12] Jesus made it all
[1605.12 → 1609.12] Jesus made it all
[1609.12 → 1613.12] All to him my own
[1613.12 → 1618.12] Sin that thy Christ has stayed
[1618.12 → 1623.12] He washed in Christ's soul
[1623.12 → 1627.12] Lord, how indeed I find
[1627.12 → 1628.12] Thy power and thine alone
[1628.12 → 1630.12] Lord, how indeed I find
[1630.12 → 1632.12] Thy power and thine alone
[1632.12 → 1634.12] And changed the lepers' cross
[1634.12 → 1636.12] And left the heart of stone
[1636.12 → 1638.12] Jesus made it all
[1638.12 → 1640.12] All to him my own
[1640.12 → 1645.12] And left the heart of stone
[1645.12 → 1647.12] Jesus made it all
[1647.12 → 1649.12] Jesus made it all
[1649.12 → 1653.12] All to him my own
[1653.12 → 1658.12] Sin that thy chrism stayed
[1658.12 → 1663.12] He washed in tight as snow
[1663.12 → 1664.12] Manyethства
[1664.12 → 1665.12] Oh
[1665.12 → 1666.12] So
[1666.12 → 1667.12] Let's sing together
[1667.12 → 1669.12] Mei
[1669.12 → 1671.12] Thank you
[1671.12 → 1672.12] Going to monks

[1690.84 → 1691.10] pays
[1691.10 → 1693.10] Amen.
[1721.10 → 1740.60] Brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe
[1740.60 → 1744.36] that the body of our Lord Jesus was broken for us.
[1744.36 → 1745.22] Let's eat together.
[1751.10 → 1753.10] Amen.
[1781.10 → 1783.10] Amen.
[1811.10 → 1820.34] Jesus made it all, all to him my heart.
[1821.10 → 1825.10] Sin had left, winds didn't stay.
[1825.10 → 1830.10] He watched it by the snow.
[1830.10 → 1842.10] And when before the dawn I stand in my feet,
[1842.10 → 1850.10] Jesus died my soul to save, my lips shall still repeat.
[1850.10 → 1860.10] Jesus made it all, all to him my heart.
[1860.10 → 1865.10] Sin had left, no prison stays.

[1998.72 → 1999.32] Let's drink together.
[2004.10 → 2006.36] Would you pray with me?
[2007.22 → 2013.32] Gracious, glorious God, you have fed us at your table.
[2014.32 → 2018.54] In your mercy, you have nourished us, and we are grateful.
[2019.48 → 2022.62] Help us now as we continue to worship you.
[2023.62 → 2025.88] In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2025.88 → 2025.98] Amen.
[2031.56 → 2035.74] So at this time, I want to invite the children to come and join me down at the steps.
[2055.88 → 2059.08] Come on up. Have a seat.
[2068.36 → 2068.88] Hello.
[2070.56 → 2071.64] A couple more coming.
[2077.64 → 2079.46] Okay. Come on up.
[2080.58 → 2082.26] You can sit here. Is that a good spot?
[2085.88 → 2090.58] Okay. Good.
[2091.52 → 2093.56] Well, it's so nice to see you all.
[2094.32 → 2095.54] How are you all doing today?
[2096.54 → 2097.96] Good. You're doing good?
[2099.18 → 2101.96] One of my favourite...
[2102.96 → 2103.96] Let's see.
[2104.86 → 2106.06] Who knows what this is?
[2106.36 → 2107.30] Candy cane.
[2107.42 → 2109.00] Candy cane. Do you all like candy canes?
[2109.08 → 2109.34] Yeah.
[2109.74 → 2111.58] Does anybody not like candy canes?
[2112.22 → 2112.66] Really?
[2113.34 → 2115.08] They can be a little spicy, maybe.
[2115.88 → 2116.48] Yeah.
[2116.48 → 2116.56] Yeah.
[2116.68 → 2119.00] And they're very pretty, and they taste delicious.
[2119.34 → 2122.42] I don't really like candy too much, but I do like candy canes.
[2123.32 → 2128.36] One of the great things about candy canes, and I think some of you know this, and you've learned this before,
[2128.90 → 2131.22] but for some of you, you may have not heard this before,
[2131.70 → 2140.50] that candy canes are great to eat at Christmas because they remind us of what Christmas is all about.
[2141.16 → 2142.80] They remind us of Jesus.
[2142.80 → 2145.78] So I'm going to tell you yes.
[2146.20 → 2148.20] And sometimes they have Christmas colours.
[2148.82 → 2150.06] They are, and they are Christmas colours.
[2150.54 → 2159.22] So I want to remind you, tell you four things that candy canes can, how they can help us remember about Jesus at Christmas.
[2159.86 → 2160.08] Okay?
[2160.08 → 2164.44] So who can see, what letter is this if you hold it upside down?
[2164.82 → 2165.02] J.
[2165.18 → 2165.78] And what's Jesus?
[2166.48 → 2166.90] For Jesus.
[2167.04 → 2168.10] Yeah, J stands for Jesus.
[2168.78 → 2175.00] And so when we eat a candy cane at Christmas, we remember Christmas is about Jesus.
[2175.56 → 2179.32] You don't eat it upside down?
[2179.68 → 2180.44] You eat it like this?
[2180.44 → 2185.86] Well, good, because the next thing it reminds us is like this.
[2186.42 → 2189.86] And who knows what this, who can guess what that looks like?
[2190.50 → 2194.18] Not a kind of F, but it's actually a shepherd's cane.
[2194.72 → 2200.92] See, if you were a shepherd, you have a cane, and that helps you hook the sheep and say, come back over here, sheep.
[2200.92 → 2202.76] So it's a shepherd's cane.
[2203.24 → 2204.40] And you know what that reminds us?
[2205.24 → 2211.84] When the angels, when Jesus was born, the angels appeared to some people in a field.
[2211.94 → 2212.46] Who were they?
[2213.56 → 2214.90] The shepherds.
[2215.26 → 2219.76] Jesus appeared to, the angels appeared to the shepherds to tell the shepherds about Jesus.
[2219.86 → 2222.16] And that tells us Jesus came for everybody.
[2222.94 → 2227.70] The angels didn't tell the priests in the temple of Jerusalem.
[2227.70 → 2230.92] They didn't tell the people living in the palace, the kings.
[2231.10 → 2233.56] They went to the shepherds, ordinary people in the fields.
[2234.22 → 2236.96] And Jesus came for all of us.
[2237.90 → 2238.96] Two more things.
[2239.30 → 2239.84] See the colours.
[2239.90 → 2240.66] What colours do we have?
[2241.40 → 2242.86] Red and white.
[2244.50 → 2245.52] Sometimes they have green.
[2245.96 → 2249.64] White, yeah, there are different ones.
[2249.74 → 2250.78] Yeah, I like the green ones too.
[2251.18 → 2252.96] But this one's kind of the traditional colours.
[2252.96 → 2266.54] And white reminds us that Jesus of snow, which also reminds us of, yeah, that Jesus was pure.
[2266.86 → 2269.06] Just like the colour white and just like snow.
[2269.70 → 2271.62] Jesus did not have sin.
[2272.66 → 2275.26] And he came to be a light in the darkness of our world.
[2275.26 → 2286.66] And then the red reminds us, Jesus' blood, that when Jesus came, he came to be a sacrificial lamb.
[2287.16 → 2288.56] That's also why he came to the shepherds.
[2290.94 → 2292.14] I don't know about the green.
[2292.92 → 2294.48] Right now we have red and white.
[2295.04 → 2299.04] So Jesus came to be our sacrificial lamb.
[2299.12 → 2300.08] He is the lamb of God.
[2300.36 → 2301.08] He is pure.
[2301.08 → 2308.88] And on Christmas, remember J for Jesus in that he came to the shepherds, people just like us.
[2309.48 → 2309.78] Okay?
[2310.14 → 2313.42] I want to read a quick passage that you might be familiar with and heard before.
[2314.50 → 2318.98] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night.
[2319.62 → 2321.52] An angel of the Lord appeared to them.
[2322.00 → 2324.54] The glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[2325.02 → 2326.92] But the angel said to them, do not be afraid.
[2326.92 → 2334.96] I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the town of David.
[2335.06 → 2336.46] A saviour has been born to you.
[2336.88 → 2338.50] He is Christ the Lord.
[2339.26 → 2339.52] Okay?
[2339.88 → 2341.80] Christ the Lord is born on Christmas.
[2342.14 → 2342.90] Can you remember that?
[2343.96 → 2344.74] All right, let's pray.
[2345.38 → 2351.04] Thank you, Jesus, that you were born the pure, spotless lamb who came to die for us.
[2351.04 → 2357.10] And you came to die for ordinary people, all people in the world who would put their faith in you.
[2357.68 → 2359.32] Lord, we thank you in Jesus' name.
[2359.80 → 2360.12] Amen.
[2360.54 → 2363.18] And of course, I can't talk about candy canes without sharing some.
[2363.88 → 2366.68] So, would anybody like one?
[2367.74 → 2368.12] Yes?
[2368.24 → 2368.56] Yes?
[2368.76 → 2368.96] Okay.
[2369.18 → 2369.64] How about this?
[2369.70 → 2372.98] You take it, and as you take it, you can go back to your seat.
[2373.10 → 2373.30] Okay?
[2374.28 → 2374.88] There you go.
[2375.72 → 2376.40] Yep, go ahead and go.
[2376.40 → 2378.96] If you get one, you can go.
[2379.04 → 2379.64] OOP, sorry.
[2380.64 → 2381.28] You got it?
[2382.18 → 2383.28] All right, here you go.
[2384.48 → 2385.08] You're welcome.
[2386.52 → 2387.16] You're welcome.
[2388.22 → 2388.98] Everyone's so polite.
[2393.46 → 2394.12] Is that one okay?
[2394.84 → 2395.86] They're all pretty much the same.
[2398.38 → 2399.28] They're all the same.
[2399.64 → 2400.38] Is this one bigger?
[2401.26 → 2402.28] A little bit, a little bit.
[2402.34 → 2402.56] Okay.
[2404.14 → 2405.42] I like the bigger ones, too.
[2405.42 → 2407.00] I totally understand.
[2408.44 → 2409.08] There you go.
[2409.94 → 2410.62] There you go.
[2412.56 → 2413.56] Sorry, that's a little small.
[2413.84 → 2414.62] You can have another one later.
[2415.46 → 2415.68] Okay.
[2415.90 → 2416.28] Here we go.
[2416.36 → 2416.70] Here we go.
[2416.76 → 2417.10] Here we go.
[2418.58 → 2419.22] Here we go.
[2422.54 → 2423.64] Oh, that is like a U.
[2424.74 → 2425.10] Okay.
[2425.54 → 2426.50] Here you go.
[2427.52 → 2428.90] And there you go, John.
[2429.42 → 2429.74] Oh, wait.
[2429.80 → 2430.26] That one's broken.
[2432.06 → 2432.38] Okay.
[2432.38 → 2432.42] Okay.
[2435.42 → 2438.74] All right.
[2438.80 → 2446.34] And so at this time, as the children go to their Sunday school classes, we'll dismiss our Chinese brothers and sisters to go and hear their sermon in Chinese.
[2446.34 → 2446.46] Yes.
[2446.46 → 2447.38] Okay.
[2447.38 → 2453.58] Okay.
[2453.58 → 2483.56] Thank you.
[2483.58 → 2488.08] All right, well, good morning again.
[2488.86 → 2491.36] It's very nice to be with you and to worship the Lord with you.
[2491.70 → 2498.08] For this season of Advent, we are in a sermon series called The Mothers of Jesus,
[2498.86 → 2507.52] where we're looking at Jesus's family tree, the genealogy of Jesus found on the opening pages of the Gospel of Matthew.
[2507.52 → 2514.12] So if you have your Bible in front of you, I want to first invite you to turn to the Gospel of Matthew.
[2514.68 → 2518.22] In your pew Bible, it is on page 717.
[2519.08 → 2524.28] But first, let me continue an introduction.
[2524.28 → 2533.22] One of the most surprising things about this genealogy is that in the ancient Near East, in that society,
[2534.06 → 2538.74] women were hardly ever included in the genealogy.
[2538.84 → 2539.70] It was only men.
[2539.70 → 2547.90] Yet Matthew opens the New Testament with a genealogy that names five women.
[2549.58 → 2559.30] And it's not the women you would expect, but all five of these mothers of Jesus were actually outsiders in some way.
[2559.30 → 2565.94] And yet Matthew included these women to say, this is what Christmas is all about.
[2566.68 → 2571.14] Jesus came, as we said earlier, to take outsiders and make them insiders,
[2571.56 → 2574.66] and to make them actually members of his family.
[2575.74 → 2581.46] So we've looked at the stories already of two of these women, Tamar and Rehab.
[2581.46 → 2589.40] And today we'll turn to the story of Ruth, which is really one of the most beloved and beautiful,
[2589.86 → 2592.98] beautifully crafted stories in all the Bible.
[2593.94 → 2597.50] So let me pray, and then we will turn to God's Word together.
[2597.68 → 2598.52] First, let's pray.
[2599.46 → 2605.20] Heavenly Father, we ask that you would open our hearts and our minds by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[2605.20 → 2609.58] so that as the Scripture is read and your Word is proclaimed,
[2609.58 → 2614.22] we may hear with joy what you say to us today.
[2614.70 → 2617.14] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2618.20 → 2621.90] So first, let's look at the genealogy, the first page of the New Testament.
[2622.72 → 2624.86] Matthew 1, we'll read verses 1 through 5.
[2625.04 → 2626.66] It's on page 717.
[2628.14 → 2629.64] And I'll just read from the screen.
[2630.00 → 2635.22] This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[2636.10 → 2637.94] Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[2637.94 → 2639.88] Isaac, the father of Jacob.
[2640.56 → 2642.92] Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[2643.68 → 2649.58] Judah, the father of Perez and Era, whose mother was Tamar.
[2650.32 → 2650.46] Okay.
[2651.48 → 2653.30] Perez, the father of Hebron.
[2653.86 → 2655.80] Hebron, the father of Ram.
[2656.62 → 2658.72] Ram, the father of Amina dab.
[2659.58 → 2661.46] Amina dab, the father of Nasion.
[2661.60 → 2663.16] Nasion, the father of Salmon.
[2663.66 → 2666.82] Salmon, the father of Boaz, whose mother was who?
[2667.80 → 2668.24] Rehab.
[2669.20 → 2671.16] So Boaz's mom is who?
[2672.42 → 2672.82] Rehab.
[2673.02 → 2673.20] Okay.
[2673.34 → 2673.84] That's interesting.
[2674.58 → 2676.68] Boaz, so we'll meet Boaz in our story today.
[2676.86 → 2677.78] His mom was Rehab.
[2677.94 → 2681.76] Boaz was the father of Bed, whose mother was Ruth.
[2682.28 → 2682.56] Okay.
[2682.60 → 2683.72] Now let's turn to Ruth.
[2683.72 → 2683.80] Ruth.
[2684.60 → 2687.52] And that is on page 195.
[2688.34 → 2691.16] Back in the Old Testament, page 195 in your Bibles.
[2693.72 → 2696.36] We're trying to cover the whole book in a short sermon.
[2696.70 → 2702.50] But what we'll do is we're just going to read a couple passages from chapter 1 and then a passage from chapter 4.
[2702.50 → 2706.50] So we'll look first at Ruth, and we'll look at verses 1 through 9.
[2707.32 → 2708.40] Ruth 1 through 9.
[2709.00 → 2710.78] And then we'll look at 14 to 22.
[2711.40 → 2711.62] Okay.
[2711.66 → 2712.30] So we'll start there.
[2712.30 → 2714.86] So here it is.
[2714.90 → 2715.72] Ruth chapter 1.
[2715.72 → 2720.26] In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land.
[2721.46 → 2730.42] So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
[2730.42 → 2733.64] The man's name was Abimelech.
[2734.12 → 2735.64] His wife's name was Naomi.
[2736.18 → 2739.26] And the names of his two sons were Mason and Kilian.
[2739.86 → 2743.72] They were Phragmites from Bethlehem, Judah.
[2744.16 → 2746.02] And they went to Moab and lived there.
[2746.64 → 2748.82] Now Abimelech, Naomi's husband, died.
[2749.22 → 2750.82] And she was left with her two sons.
[2752.16 → 2756.08] They married Mobile women, one named Orphan and the other Ruth.
[2756.08 → 2761.34] After they had lived there about ten years, both Mason and Kilian also died.
[2762.18 → 2765.32] And Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
[2767.12 → 2773.96] When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them,
[2774.64 → 2779.18] she and her daughter-in-law prepared to return home from there with her two daughters-in-law.
[2779.18 → 2786.56] She left the place where they had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
[2788.26 → 2791.22] Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law,
[2791.42 → 2793.42] Go back, each of you, to your mother's home.
[2794.18 → 2798.82] May the Lord show you kindness as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.
[2799.38 → 2803.42] May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.
[2804.06 → 2806.62] Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud.
[2806.62 → 2813.02] As they wept aloud again, at this they wept aloud again.
[2813.24 → 2815.50] This is, I think we're in verse 14 now.
[2816.00 → 2820.22] Then Orphan kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
[2820.76 → 2824.22] Look, said Naomi, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods.
[2824.54 → 2826.02] Go back with her.
[2827.24 → 2830.86] But Ruth replied, Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you.
[2831.34 → 2832.80] Where you go, I will go.
[2833.46 → 2835.26] Where you stay, I will stay.
[2835.26 → 2839.06] Your people will be my people and your God my God.
[2839.50 → 2841.08] Where you die, I will die.
[2841.18 → 2842.44] And there I will be buried.
[2843.12 → 2844.48] May the Lord deal with me.
[2844.82 → 2849.04] Be ever so severely if even death separates you from me.
[2850.58 → 2854.78] When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
[2855.66 → 2858.10] So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem.
[2858.10 → 2862.98] When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them.
[2863.46 → 2866.18] The women exclaimed, Can this be Naomi?
[2867.52 → 2869.84] Don't call me Naomi, she told them.
[2870.30 → 2875.04] Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
[2875.04 → 2879.48] I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty.
[2880.30 → 2881.36] Why call me Naomi?
[2881.76 → 2883.98] The Lord has afflicted me.
[2884.52 → 2888.16] The Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.
[2889.60 → 2894.78] So Naomi returned from Moab, accompanied by Ruth, the Mobile, her daughter-in-law,
[2895.36 → 2899.30] arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
[2899.30 → 2908.72] So now turn to chapter 4, if you have your Bibles open, chapter 4, and we will look at
[2908.72 → 2911.52] verses 9 through 17, 9 through 17.
[2912.20 → 2913.62] Chapter 4, verse 9.
[2913.96 → 2916.60] So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife.
[2917.42 → 2921.54] When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
[2922.44 → 2927.52] The women said to Naomi, Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without
[2927.52 → 2928.58] a guardian redeemer.
[2928.58 → 2931.10] May he become famous throughout Israel.
[2931.92 → 2934.84] He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age.
[2935.44 → 2941.02] For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given
[2941.02 → 2941.68] him birth.
[2942.56 → 2945.58] Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him.
[2946.52 → 2950.46] The women living there said, Naomi has a son.
[2950.92 → 2952.18] And they named him Bed.
[2952.88 → 2957.26] He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
[2957.26 → 2959.32] This is the word of the Lord.
[2960.02 → 2961.14] Thanks be to God.
[2962.92 → 2967.08] So I want to start out the message today with a quote.
[2967.98 → 2973.56] So Fleming Rutledge is an Episcopal priest, an evangelical Episcopal priest, in New York
[2973.56 → 2973.86] City.
[2974.52 → 2980.48] And she preached an Advent sermon right after the events of 9-11, in which she said this.
[2980.48 → 2987.02] Advent says Christmas is not for sissies.
[2988.02 → 2996.14] Advent says, flatly contradicting the Christmas song, all your troubles are not going to be
[2996.14 → 2996.82] miles away.
[2998.82 → 3002.46] Advent says this world is full of darkness.
[3002.46 → 3011.56] And it was into such a world as this, not fairyland, that the Son of God came.
[3013.68 → 3022.90] And the inclusion of Ruth in the genealogy of Jesus is just such a reminder to us.
[3024.02 → 3026.42] That Advent is not for sissies.
[3026.42 → 3033.82] It's easy to read the story of Ruth superficially as kind of traditional love story.
[3033.94 → 3034.84] Boy meets girl.
[3035.28 → 3036.26] They get married.
[3036.36 → 3037.06] They have a baby.
[3037.28 → 3039.60] And they live happily ever after.
[3040.56 → 3047.76] And while it is true that the story ends in joy, it doesn't begin that way.
[3047.76 → 3056.18] Much like the season of Advent itself, as Fleming Rutledge also famously says, she says, Advent
[3056.18 → 3061.52] begins in the dark and moves toward the light.
[3062.46 → 3069.54] And that's why in this Christmas season, we don't immediately start just singing happy songs.
[3069.66 → 3074.16] Sometimes we sing songs of longing, calling out for God, O come, O come, Emmanuel.
[3074.16 → 3082.38] Well, on this Sunday, there's a little bit of a respite in the season of fasting because
[3082.38 → 3086.52] we light the candle, the pink candle, the candle of joy, and we sing joy to the world.
[3087.48 → 3094.34] It's a reminder of the joy to come, but still we sit in this time of Advent, of waiting and
[3094.34 → 3094.88] of longing.
[3097.40 → 3099.20] So Advent begins in the dark.
[3099.20 → 3104.72] And that's how I want us to look at this familiar story today as a movement from dark to light,
[3105.10 → 3113.44] as a movement from emptiness to fullness, from bitterness to joy.
[3114.28 → 3121.32] And most surprisingly, from Ruth at first being an outsider of God's people to in the end being
[3121.32 → 3123.84] in the very genealogy of kings.
[3125.02 → 3126.52] So Advent begins in the dark.
[3126.52 → 3131.20] And the story of Ruth also begins in the dark.
[3133.00 → 3137.22] And the first thing to say about the story is that it's a story actually driven by two women,
[3138.14 → 3140.18] Naomi and Ruth.
[3141.18 → 3145.58] And so while Ruth turns out to be in the genealogy as the mother of Jesus,
[3146.30 → 3148.94] much of the story actually focuses on Naomi.
[3149.66 → 3152.90] It is told from her point of view.
[3152.90 → 3156.26] Actually, there's only a little, what is this, trivia?
[3156.66 → 3162.90] Two books in the Bible named after women are Esther and this one, Ruth, right?
[3163.32 → 3167.84] And Ruth in particular is told from the story, from the perspective of a woman.
[3168.42 → 3169.92] So that's unique.
[3170.68 → 3175.88] So the narrative opens in verse one with a pretty dark setting.
[3175.88 → 3183.30] In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land.
[3184.36 → 3191.88] The days of the judges were a dark time in Israel's history when people were turning away from God.
[3192.42 → 3196.70] And as a result of that, there was widespread immorality and oppression.
[3196.70 → 3203.08] And so on top of that cultural background that's happening in all the land,
[3203.58 → 3206.66] there was a famine in the land of Judah.
[3207.76 → 3215.50] And the famine was so severe that this family from Bethlehem became refugees in the land of Moab.
[3215.92 → 3219.80] So they had already come from the Transjordan across the Jordan into the Promised Land,
[3220.06 → 3222.04] and now they're going back.
[3222.08 → 3225.14] They're going back across the Jordan into the land of Moab.
[3225.14 → 3233.72] That tells us that this famine was so severe because the Mobiles were Israel's traditional enemies.
[3234.94 → 3241.56] So Naomi and Abimelech and their two sons went to Moab to live for a while so that they could eat.
[3243.24 → 3244.50] So they're facing a famine.
[3245.84 → 3247.30] Then Abimelech died.
[3248.84 → 3250.82] Imagine not only losing your husband,
[3250.82 → 3255.02] but losing him while you're living in a foreign country,
[3255.44 → 3258.34] people who don't necessarily like you very much,
[3258.66 → 3259.66] as a refugee.
[3262.70 → 3264.80] But Naomi had her two sons,
[3264.92 → 3267.52] and her sons married Mobile women,
[3268.24 → 3269.18] Orphan and Ruth.
[3269.96 → 3272.90] That may have been another point of heartache.
[3273.42 → 3274.34] This was a no-no.
[3274.34 → 3278.28] You know, Israelites were not to marry other people,
[3278.38 → 3279.54] especially ones, the Mobiles,
[3279.60 → 3280.82] who worshipped other gods,
[3281.92 → 3284.84] who the worship of the Mobile god involved child sacrifice.
[3284.84 → 3288.72] But it says,
[3289.18 → 3289.72] also,
[3290.84 → 3292.30] there's a detail in verse 4
[3292.30 → 3295.02] that tells us even something more about
[3295.02 → 3296.58] the hardness,
[3296.78 → 3297.96] the suffering of their situation.
[3298.70 → 3299.28] It says,
[3299.38 → 3300.70] they married Mobile women,
[3300.90 → 3302.44] one named Orphan and the other Ruth,
[3303.00 → 3304.98] after they had lived there about 10 years.
[3305.72 → 3307.72] So there's a detail that's easy to read past,
[3307.82 → 3309.34] but this is what I think it tells us.
[3309.34 → 3312.06] That not only did these sons marry Mobile women
[3312.06 → 3313.92] who worshipped other gods,
[3314.08 → 3315.20] but after 10 years,
[3315.72 → 3317.44] neither of them had children.
[3318.50 → 3319.46] And in that culture,
[3319.56 → 3321.28] if you were married for 10 years without children,
[3321.42 → 3322.80] it was not for lack of trying.
[3323.62 → 3325.74] They were experiencing infertility.
[3326.50 → 3328.78] And as painful as infertility can be today,
[3328.88 → 3329.58] in that culture,
[3329.74 → 3331.70] to be able to have a child
[3331.70 → 3334.26] was the measure of a woman's worth.
[3335.62 → 3337.88] So this was a bitter pill for Naomi,
[3337.88 → 3339.72] for her sons,
[3340.68 → 3342.70] and for Orphan and Ruth.
[3344.58 → 3347.30] And then something no parent ever wants to live to see,
[3348.40 → 3350.26] Naomi sees not only one,
[3350.62 → 3352.86] but both of her sons die.
[3353.82 → 3355.12] She has to bury her children.
[3356.50 → 3359.72] So she has lost both her sons and her husband,
[3360.30 → 3361.26] and with them,
[3361.34 → 3363.40] all the means of economic support.
[3364.98 → 3366.36] And so there are widows,
[3366.36 → 3369.52] and then there is Naomi.
[3370.48 → 3372.42] Her parents are no longer living.
[3372.90 → 3374.66] She's too old to remarry.
[3375.38 → 3378.16] She has no heirs to look after her.
[3378.80 → 3379.98] She is destitute,
[3380.66 → 3381.20] bereft,
[3381.20 → 3384.12] and surrounded by grief.
[3384.12 → 3387.86] She heard that the famine
[3387.86 → 3389.64] had finally ceased back home.
[3390.78 → 3392.82] She knew that there were no prospects
[3392.82 → 3396.40] for widowed Mobile women back in Judah.
[3397.14 → 3398.90] They would be marginalized.
[3400.40 → 3403.52] They likely may even have been in danger
[3403.52 → 3404.90] of violence and abuse.
[3405.58 → 3408.94] So she begs them to return home to their families.
[3408.94 → 3412.82] This gives us some insight into Naomi's character.
[3414.32 → 3417.76] These were the only two people in the world
[3417.76 → 3419.30] who could possibly help her.
[3420.08 → 3422.04] And yet, for their sake,
[3422.20 → 3423.98] and at great cost to herself,
[3424.58 → 3425.70] Naomi says to them,
[3425.90 → 3426.56] leave me,
[3427.20 → 3428.48] go home.
[3428.48 → 3430.86] And she prayed for them
[3430.86 → 3432.44] a prayer of blessing
[3432.44 → 3436.52] that she could no longer believe for herself.
[3437.00 → 3438.74] In chapter 1, verse 8,
[3439.24 → 3439.74] she says,
[3440.38 → 3442.10] may the Lord show you kindness.
[3442.76 → 3443.76] May the Lord grant
[3443.76 → 3444.66] that each of you
[3444.66 → 3445.64] will find rest
[3445.64 → 3447.56] in the home of another husband.
[3448.40 → 3449.90] That was the only hope
[3449.90 → 3450.78] that these young women
[3450.78 → 3452.00] had in that culture.
[3452.88 → 3454.12] So she kissed them,
[3454.78 → 3456.12] and they wept together.
[3456.12 → 3459.26] Orphan finally relented,
[3459.38 → 3460.28] and she went back home.
[3461.16 → 3462.60] But Ruth refused
[3462.60 → 3464.22] to leave Naomi's side.
[3465.20 → 3466.50] So Naomi and Ruth
[3466.50 → 3467.74] returned to Judah together.
[3468.74 → 3469.84] And then we read this
[3469.84 → 3470.82] in verse 19.
[3471.76 → 3473.66] When they arrived in Bethlehem,
[3474.32 → 3475.78] the whole town
[3475.78 → 3476.86] was stirred
[3476.86 → 3478.52] because of them,
[3479.06 → 3480.32] not in a good way.
[3481.44 → 3482.78] The woman exclaimed,
[3483.16 → 3485.56] can this be Naomi?
[3486.12 → 3489.30] And I think that this is telling us
[3489.30 → 3490.26] that those 10 years
[3490.26 → 3491.78] had been so hard
[3491.78 → 3492.94] on her,
[3493.20 → 3495.28] that she had gone through so much,
[3495.52 → 3495.90] that she had,
[3496.24 → 3497.26] that her suffering
[3497.26 → 3498.94] had taken a physical toll,
[3499.66 → 3500.76] so much so
[3500.76 → 3503.04] that she was hardly recognizable.
[3504.16 → 3505.48] Can this be Naomi?
[3507.48 → 3508.74] And in verse 20,
[3508.86 → 3509.66] she replies,
[3510.32 → 3511.78] don't call me Naomi.
[3511.78 → 3511.92] Naomi,
[3512.56 → 3513.64] the name Naomi
[3513.64 → 3515.36] means sweet or pleasant.
[3516.36 → 3516.72] She said,
[3516.84 → 3517.52] don't call me Naomi.
[3517.82 → 3519.18] That's not who I am anymore.
[3520.06 → 3521.02] Call me Mara
[3521.02 → 3523.12] because the Almighty
[3523.12 → 3524.60] has made my life
[3524.60 → 3526.06] very bitter.
[3526.70 → 3528.46] Mara means bitter.
[3529.46 → 3530.68] I went away full,
[3531.68 → 3532.90] but the Lord
[3532.90 → 3534.86] has brought me back empty.
[3534.86 → 3534.98] Naomi.
[3536.42 → 3538.22] When Naomi returns home
[3538.22 → 3539.48] by her own reckoning,
[3539.60 → 3540.38] she is empty.
[3540.88 → 3541.82] She is bitter,
[3542.68 → 3544.04] and she blames God.
[3545.30 → 3546.48] And after all
[3546.48 → 3547.48] that she has been through,
[3547.72 → 3548.76] who can blame her?
[3550.52 → 3551.24] And the question,
[3551.44 → 3552.18] as the readers,
[3552.28 → 3553.38] that we are confronted with
[3553.38 → 3553.94] in this passage
[3553.94 → 3554.48] is,
[3555.12 → 3556.06] in the face of all
[3556.06 → 3557.00] that she has suffered,
[3557.96 → 3559.60] is God good
[3559.60 → 3560.74] to Naomi?
[3562.04 → 3563.32] Does God care
[3563.32 → 3565.70] about one broken-hearted woman?
[3566.94 → 3568.52] Does God see her?
[3569.66 → 3571.30] Has his steadfast love
[3571.30 → 3572.42] for her ceased?
[3572.88 → 3574.16] Has his promises
[3574.16 → 3575.50] failed?
[3576.90 → 3578.22] Because when Naomi
[3578.22 → 3579.02] looks around,
[3579.72 → 3581.32] it sure looks like it,
[3582.22 → 3583.30] and she gives voice
[3583.30 → 3583.78] to that.
[3584.90 → 3586.48] And her experience
[3586.48 → 3587.86] is in the Bible.
[3588.80 → 3589.66] Her feelings,
[3589.78 → 3590.68] her point of view,
[3590.82 → 3591.74] Naomi feels
[3591.74 → 3593.00] abandoned by God,
[3593.00 → 3594.82] and she says
[3594.82 → 3595.94] as much.
[3597.70 → 3599.14] And maybe this morning,
[3599.44 → 3601.16] you feel like
[3601.16 → 3602.38] Naomi in some ways.
[3603.42 → 3604.68] Maybe you're asking
[3604.68 → 3605.76] the same questions
[3605.76 → 3606.28] of God.
[3607.96 → 3609.58] Does he still care
[3609.58 → 3610.34] about me?
[3612.34 → 3614.10] Has his steadfast love
[3614.10 → 3615.10] for me ceased?
[3615.18 → 3615.96] Has his promises
[3615.96 → 3616.46] failed?
[3616.46 → 3617.84] God's love for you
[3617.84 → 3618.32] to see you
[3618.32 → 3618.84] in the world.
[3618.84 → 3620.08] Because when we look
[3620.08 → 3620.86] at our lives,
[3620.94 → 3621.54] we look at the world
[3621.54 → 3622.10] around us,
[3622.16 → 3623.34] we look into our own
[3623.34 → 3623.96] hearts,
[3624.42 → 3626.02] we see that things
[3626.02 → 3626.84] are still broken.
[3627.80 → 3627.92] Right?
[3627.98 → 3628.84] Things are just still
[3628.84 → 3629.58] too broken.
[3630.62 → 3631.52] And this can lead us
[3631.52 → 3632.50] to wonder if God
[3632.50 → 3633.86] really is rescuing us
[3633.86 → 3634.40] in our sin
[3634.40 → 3635.98] and sheltering us
[3635.98 → 3636.62] with his love.
[3637.78 → 3638.52] It can lead us,
[3638.62 → 3639.24] in other words,
[3639.38 → 3640.20] to lose hope.
[3640.20 → 3642.02] When we take an
[3642.02 → 3642.80] honest look at the
[3642.80 → 3644.06] darkness of our world,
[3644.86 → 3645.82] it can cause us
[3645.82 → 3647.88] to not see any joy.
[3649.60 → 3650.78] But what we see
[3650.78 → 3651.48] in Naomi
[3651.48 → 3652.90] is that she is a
[3652.90 → 3653.76] woman of tremendous
[3653.76 → 3654.38] faith.
[3655.40 → 3656.56] The darkness of her
[3656.56 → 3657.78] life is making God
[3657.78 → 3659.06] feel distant from her.
[3659.94 → 3660.86] We get a clue of that
[3660.86 → 3661.34] when she says,
[3661.42 → 3662.22] the Almighty
[3662.22 → 3663.70] has done this,
[3664.06 → 3665.06] not Yahweh,
[3665.14 → 3665.76] the covenant name
[3665.76 → 3666.22] of God.
[3666.22 → 3666.30] God.
[3669.04 → 3669.96] But Naomi
[3669.96 → 3670.82] doesn't pretend
[3670.82 → 3671.28] with God
[3671.28 → 3672.22] about her feelings.
[3673.30 → 3673.50] Right?
[3673.56 → 3674.40] Even though sometimes
[3674.40 → 3675.46] we might feel ashamed
[3675.46 → 3676.16] to admit
[3676.16 → 3677.40] how we truly
[3677.40 → 3678.24] feel to God,
[3678.98 → 3679.98] but her willingness
[3679.98 → 3680.82] to bring her
[3680.82 → 3681.88] true emotions
[3681.88 → 3682.90] to God in prayer,
[3683.22 → 3684.14] to still hold
[3684.14 → 3684.94] on to him,
[3685.80 → 3686.92] is faith.
[3687.80 → 3688.72] That's what Naomi
[3688.72 → 3689.48] has to teach us
[3689.48 → 3690.10] about faith.
[3690.78 → 3691.26] And that's something
[3691.26 → 3691.94] that we can learn
[3691.94 → 3692.44] from her.
[3693.88 → 3694.58] So Advent
[3694.58 → 3695.60] begins in the dark.
[3696.94 → 3697.88] It's honest
[3697.88 → 3699.78] with life
[3699.78 → 3700.54] in this world,
[3700.64 → 3701.12] in a sinful
[3701.12 → 3701.92] and broken world.
[3702.98 → 3703.82] But the story
[3703.82 → 3704.56] doesn't end there
[3704.56 → 3705.70] because Advent
[3705.70 → 3707.90] moves toward the light.
[3708.64 → 3709.30] Advent begins
[3709.30 → 3709.94] in the dark,
[3710.26 → 3710.94] but Advent moves
[3710.94 → 3711.52] toward the light.
[3711.84 → 3712.32] And so does
[3712.32 → 3713.22] the story of Ruth.
[3713.34 → 3713.90] And that's the second
[3713.90 → 3714.66] thing we see here.
[3715.66 → 3716.68] And this brings us
[3716.68 → 3717.64] to Ruth herself,
[3718.30 → 3719.60] who is like
[3719.60 → 3720.92] a shining star
[3720.92 → 3722.14] in the darkness
[3722.14 → 3723.52] of this story.
[3724.16 → 3725.08] It is Ruth
[3725.08 → 3725.68] who utters
[3725.68 → 3726.50] the most famous
[3726.50 → 3727.46] lines in the book
[3727.46 → 3728.60] when Naomi
[3728.60 → 3729.60] pleads with Ruth,
[3729.70 → 3730.58] go back home
[3730.58 → 3732.66] to your own family.
[3732.84 → 3733.42] It is Ruth
[3733.42 → 3734.00] who says
[3734.00 → 3734.94] in verse 16,
[3735.38 → 3735.80] she says
[3735.80 → 3736.72] this amazing line,
[3737.14 → 3737.70] don't urge me
[3737.70 → 3738.30] to leave you
[3738.30 → 3739.04] or to turn back
[3739.04 → 3739.50] from you.
[3740.50 → 3741.22] Where you go,
[3741.30 → 3741.92] I will go.
[3742.30 → 3743.00] Where you stay,
[3743.08 → 3743.70] I will stay.
[3744.02 → 3744.62] Your people
[3744.62 → 3745.50] will be my people.
[3745.64 → 3746.30] Your God,
[3746.44 → 3747.06] my God.
[3747.58 → 3748.36] Where you die,
[3748.48 → 3749.22] I will die.
[3749.80 → 3750.14] There,
[3750.14 → 3751.18] I will be buried.
[3751.86 → 3752.40] May the Lord
[3752.40 → 3753.10] deal with me
[3753.10 → 3754.30] be ever so severely
[3754.30 → 3755.28] even if death
[3755.28 → 3755.92] separates you
[3755.92 → 3756.50] from me.
[3759.48 → 3760.32] And it's even
[3760.32 → 3761.12] more remarkable
[3761.12 → 3761.96] to consider
[3761.96 → 3762.48] that Ruth
[3762.48 → 3763.66] has no prospects
[3763.66 → 3764.16] in Judah.
[3765.74 → 3765.94] Right?
[3766.00 → 3766.62] She's doing this
[3766.62 → 3767.62] at great cost
[3767.62 → 3768.52] to herself.
[3769.96 → 3770.62] And Naomi
[3770.62 → 3771.44] is about to say,
[3771.56 → 3771.68] well,
[3771.72 → 3772.36] God has made
[3772.36 → 3773.30] my life very bitter.
[3774.08 → 3774.84] And Ruth says,
[3775.14 → 3776.52] I want your God
[3776.52 → 3777.30] to be my God.
[3779.16 → 3779.84] So Ruth
[3779.84 → 3780.66] goes with Naomi,
[3780.66 → 3781.28] they go back
[3781.28 → 3782.06] to Bethlehem
[3782.06 → 3782.66] and Judah.
[3783.62 → 3784.18] And because
[3784.18 → 3785.36] they are so poor
[3785.36 → 3786.28] and destitute,
[3787.12 → 3787.78] Ruth starts
[3787.78 → 3788.50] to glean
[3788.50 → 3789.82] in Boaz's field.
[3790.48 → 3791.12] Now you need
[3791.12 → 3791.38] to know
[3791.38 → 3792.10] that a gleaner
[3792.10 → 3793.30] is even lower
[3793.30 → 3794.18] than a field servant.
[3795.42 → 3796.30] Ruth is truly
[3796.30 → 3797.32] of humble estate.
[3798.44 → 3799.24] But it's
[3799.24 → 3800.14] her character
[3800.14 → 3801.46] that first
[3801.46 → 3802.68] attracts Boaz,
[3803.32 → 3804.30] whom we are told
[3804.30 → 3805.32] is a worthy man.
[3806.22 → 3806.94] Boaz knows
[3806.94 → 3807.44] that she is
[3807.44 → 3808.24] a Mobile widow.
[3808.24 → 3809.90] he's heard
[3809.90 → 3810.42] about all
[3810.42 → 3810.90] that she has
[3810.90 → 3811.34] done
[3811.34 → 3811.96] for her
[3811.96 → 3812.62] mother-in-law,
[3812.94 → 3813.50] taking care
[3813.50 → 3813.70] of her,
[3813.78 → 3814.30] coming back
[3814.30 → 3814.76] with her.
[3815.56 → 3816.32] And he not
[3816.32 → 3816.86] only tells
[3816.86 → 3817.68] his field workers
[3817.68 → 3818.74] to pull out
[3818.74 → 3819.50] stocks of grain
[3819.50 → 3820.16] and leave them
[3820.16 → 3820.70] for her
[3820.70 → 3821.40] so that she
[3821.40 → 3821.82] can glean
[3821.82 → 3822.44] enough food,
[3822.76 → 3823.32] he actually
[3823.32 → 3824.62] then gives
[3824.62 → 3825.72] Ruth and
[3825.72 → 3826.08] Naomi
[3826.08 → 3827.18] a whole year's
[3827.18 → 3828.46] supply of food.
[3829.64 → 3830.08] And then
[3830.08 → 3830.52] this is what
[3830.52 → 3831.34] Boaz says
[3831.34 → 3831.90] to Ruth
[3831.90 → 3833.32] in chapter 2,
[3833.62 → 3834.22] verse 12.
[3835.38 → 3835.98] He says,
[3836.24 → 3836.78] May the Lord
[3836.78 → 3837.46] repay you
[3837.46 → 3838.02] for what you
[3838.02 → 3838.60] have done.
[3839.18 → 3839.64] May you
[3839.64 → 3840.30] be richly
[3840.30 → 3840.76] rewarded
[3840.76 → 3841.56] by the Lord,
[3841.96 → 3842.48] the God
[3842.48 → 3843.04] of Israel,
[3843.60 → 3844.50] under whose
[3844.50 → 3845.72] wings you
[3845.72 → 3846.46] have come
[3846.46 → 3847.70] to take
[3847.70 → 3848.22] refuge.
[3849.84 → 3850.32] Ruth has
[3850.32 → 3850.68] come to
[3850.68 → 3851.32] take refuge
[3851.32 → 3851.74] under the
[3851.74 → 3853.14] wings of
[3853.14 → 3853.56] Yahweh,
[3853.80 → 3854.28] the Lord,
[3854.48 → 3854.76] the God
[3854.76 → 3855.20] of Israel.
[3856.72 → 3857.38] And little
[3857.38 → 3858.06] did Boaz
[3858.06 → 3858.96] know in
[3858.96 → 3859.58] saying this
[3859.58 → 3860.28] blessing upon
[3860.28 → 3860.98] Ruth that he
[3860.98 → 3861.48] would become
[3861.48 → 3862.04] the answer
[3862.04 → 3862.72] to his own
[3862.72 → 3863.08] prayers.
[3863.60 → 3864.24] That's often
[3864.24 → 3864.62] the way it
[3864.62 → 3864.94] is.
[3864.94 → 3866.94] Because you
[3866.94 → 3867.24] see, it
[3867.24 → 3867.70] turns out
[3867.70 → 3868.50] that Boaz
[3868.50 → 3869.68] was Naomi's
[3869.68 → 3869.98] relative.
[3870.68 → 3871.14] And so two
[3871.14 → 3871.64] weeks ago,
[3871.68 → 3872.10] we looked at
[3872.10 → 3872.60] the story of
[3872.60 → 3874.12] Tamar, and
[3874.12 → 3874.50] we talked
[3874.50 → 3875.30] about Severity
[3875.30 → 3875.86] marriage.
[3876.20 → 3876.58] Well, it's the
[3876.58 → 3876.96] same thing
[3876.96 → 3877.64] going on here.
[3878.12 → 3878.46] In that
[3878.46 → 3879.14] culture, a
[3879.14 → 3880.26] widow would
[3880.26 → 3880.74] be taken
[3880.74 → 3881.20] into the
[3881.20 → 3882.32] home of
[3882.32 → 3882.84] her husband's
[3882.84 → 3884.38] family, not
[3884.38 → 3884.82] only to
[3884.82 → 3885.54] perpetuate the
[3885.54 → 3886.22] husband's name,
[3886.54 → 3887.22] but also to
[3887.22 → 3887.72] keep the
[3887.72 → 3889.60] land in the
[3889.60 → 3890.42] dead man's
[3890.42 → 3892.20] lineage and
[3892.20 → 3892.58] property.
[3892.58 → 3894.44] And that's
[3894.44 → 3894.92] what Naomi
[3894.92 → 3895.46] means when
[3895.46 → 3896.18] she says to
[3896.18 → 3896.68] her in
[3896.68 → 3897.18] chapter 2,
[3897.22 → 3897.70] verse 20,
[3897.84 → 3898.28] she says,
[3898.40 → 3899.48] that man is
[3899.48 → 3899.98] our close
[3899.98 → 3900.40] relative.
[3900.70 → 3901.28] He is one
[3901.28 → 3901.96] of our
[3901.96 → 3902.86] guardian
[3902.86 → 3903.66] redeemers,
[3903.72 → 3903.94] or in
[3903.94 → 3904.24] your Bible
[3904.24 → 3904.48] it might
[3904.48 → 3905.32] say kinsmen
[3905.32 → 3906.08] redeemers.
[3907.00 → 3907.74] So Boaz
[3907.74 → 3908.12] has the
[3908.12 → 3908.96] opportunity and
[3908.96 → 3909.46] really actually
[3909.46 → 3910.28] the responsibility
[3910.28 → 3911.64] to marry
[3911.64 → 3912.92] Ruth in
[3912.92 → 3913.38] order to
[3913.38 → 3914.00] protect her
[3914.00 → 3914.46] and Naomi
[3914.46 → 3915.68] and to
[3915.68 → 3916.28] redeem the
[3916.28 → 3916.78] land that
[3916.78 → 3917.42] Abimelech,
[3917.54 → 3917.86] Naomi's
[3917.86 → 3918.14] husband,
[3918.24 → 3918.82] had sold
[3918.82 → 3919.28] because of
[3919.28 → 3919.72] the famine
[3919.72 → 3921.02] to carry
[3921.02 → 3921.56] on the
[3921.56 → 3922.16] family name.
[3923.14 → 3923.84] To make a
[3923.84 → 3924.22] very long
[3924.22 → 3924.86] story short,
[3924.96 → 3925.26] and I do
[3925.26 → 3925.72] encourage you
[3925.72 → 3926.10] to go and
[3926.10 → 3926.66] read the
[3926.66 → 3926.94] book of
[3926.94 → 3927.40] Ruth again,
[3927.50 → 3927.74] it's a
[3927.74 → 3928.86] beautiful story.
[3929.50 → 3930.12] To make a
[3930.12 → 3930.48] long story
[3930.48 → 3930.86] short,
[3931.82 → 3932.02] there was
[3932.02 → 3932.60] another guy
[3932.60 → 3932.92] who was a
[3932.92 → 3933.54] closer relative.
[3934.46 → 3934.88] He was
[3934.88 → 3935.30] eager to
[3935.30 → 3935.62] buy the
[3935.62 → 3935.94] land,
[3936.06 → 3936.32] but when
[3936.32 → 3936.84] he realized
[3936.84 → 3937.12] he had to
[3937.12 → 3937.74] marry Ruth,
[3937.80 → 3938.08] it would
[3938.08 → 3938.44] be actually
[3938.44 → 3938.92] at cost
[3938.92 → 3939.32] to him.
[3940.38 → 3940.70] And so
[3940.70 → 3941.68] he says,
[3941.80 → 3942.32] I pass.
[3942.84 → 3943.28] Boaz,
[3943.48 → 3944.22] even though it
[3944.22 → 3944.78] didn't benefit
[3944.78 → 3945.46] him financially
[3945.46 → 3946.20] at all,
[3946.42 → 3947.08] he marries
[3947.08 → 3947.48] Ruth.
[3949.14 → 3949.74] They get
[3949.74 → 3950.30] married and
[3950.30 → 3950.72] they have
[3950.72 → 3951.20] a child.
[3951.20 → 3953.16] And in
[3953.16 → 3953.88] chapter 4,
[3953.98 → 3954.62] verse 14,
[3955.00 → 3955.76] we have this
[3955.76 → 3956.60] beautiful verse,
[3957.88 → 3958.36] the women.
[3959.18 → 3959.72] We don't know
[3959.72 → 3959.98] who these
[3959.98 → 3960.50] women are.
[3960.90 → 3961.34] This is the
[3961.34 → 3961.62] women,
[3962.06 → 3962.64] the women of
[3962.64 → 3963.06] the town,
[3963.18 → 3963.76] these Israelite
[3963.76 → 3964.04] women.
[3964.04 → 3965.28] they said to
[3965.28 → 3965.66] Naomi,
[3966.30 → 3967.00] praise me to
[3967.00 → 3967.48] the Lord,
[3967.80 → 3968.28] who has
[3968.28 → 3968.92] this day
[3968.92 → 3969.52] not left
[3969.52 → 3970.00] you without
[3970.00 → 3970.60] a guardian
[3970.60 → 3971.18] redeemer.
[3971.66 → 3972.18] May he
[3972.18 → 3974.40] become famous
[3974.40 → 3974.92] throughout Israel,
[3975.02 → 3975.60] that he is the
[3975.60 → 3975.96] child.
[3976.18 → 3976.58] May he,
[3976.68 → 3977.08] the child,
[3977.16 → 3977.72] become famous
[3977.72 → 3978.50] throughout Israel.
[3979.78 → 3980.66] He will
[3980.66 → 3981.42] renew your
[3981.42 → 3982.44] life and
[3982.44 → 3983.06] sustain you
[3983.06 → 3983.52] in your old
[3983.52 → 3983.90] age.
[3984.10 → 3984.66] For your
[3984.66 → 3985.30] daughter-in-law,
[3985.42 → 3986.04] who loves you
[3986.04 → 3986.44] and who is
[3986.44 → 3987.10] better to you
[3987.10 → 3987.72] than seven
[3987.72 → 3988.26] sons,
[3988.96 → 3989.54] has given
[3989.54 → 3990.58] him birth.
[3990.58 → 3992.26] So notice
[3992.26 → 3992.58] what is
[3992.58 → 3993.20] happening here.
[3993.98 → 3994.36] Notice what
[3994.36 → 3994.78] is happening.
[3995.54 → 3996.08] These women
[3996.08 → 3996.88] of Bethlehem
[3996.88 → 3998.04] are coming
[3998.04 → 3998.74] around Naomi
[3998.74 → 3999.22] and they are
[3999.22 → 3999.52] saying,
[3999.62 → 4000.00] Naomi,
[4000.20 → 4000.74] look at what
[4000.74 → 4001.56] God has
[4001.56 → 4002.44] done for
[4002.44 → 4002.92] you.
[4004.08 → 4004.32] Right?
[4004.38 → 4004.80] Remember,
[4004.94 → 4005.82] Naomi had
[4005.82 → 4006.64] begun this
[4006.64 → 4007.10] book in
[4007.10 → 4007.74] chapter 1
[4007.74 → 4008.70] in bitterness
[4008.70 → 4009.90] and in loss.
[4010.62 → 4011.34] She's got a
[4011.34 → 4011.86] dead husband,
[4012.50 → 4013.22] she's got two
[4013.22 → 4013.96] dead sons,
[4014.24 → 4014.72] and she's
[4014.72 → 4016.14] urging her
[4016.14 → 4017.20] daughters-in-law
[4017.20 → 4018.46] to leave her
[4018.46 → 4019.32] to go find
[4019.32 → 4019.78] their own
[4019.78 → 4020.56] life and
[4020.56 → 4020.96] just let
[4020.96 → 4021.38] her die
[4021.38 → 4022.10] by herself.
[4023.04 → 4023.14] Right?
[4023.18 → 4023.54] That's what's
[4023.54 → 4023.96] happening in
[4023.96 → 4024.52] chapter 1.
[4024.98 → 4025.68] And now at
[4025.68 → 4026.10] the end of
[4026.10 → 4026.62] the story,
[4027.20 → 4027.54] through the
[4027.54 → 4028.32] kindness of
[4028.32 → 4029.02] Boaz and
[4029.02 → 4029.44] Ruth,
[4030.22 → 4031.50] God has
[4031.50 → 4032.84] rescued Naomi
[4032.84 → 4034.28] and he has
[4034.28 → 4034.68] given her
[4034.68 → 4035.90] joy and he
[4035.90 → 4036.20] has given
[4036.20 → 4036.70] her fullness.
[4037.98 → 4038.46] The women
[4038.46 → 4039.14] say to her,
[4039.76 → 4040.66] see what
[4040.66 → 4041.50] God has
[4041.50 → 4042.10] done for
[4042.10 → 4042.36] you.
[4043.32 → 4044.30] You who
[4044.30 → 4045.06] were hungry
[4045.06 → 4046.06] now have
[4046.06 → 4046.46] food.
[4047.30 → 4048.02] You who
[4048.02 → 4048.76] were alone
[4048.76 → 4049.50] now have
[4049.50 → 4049.90] family.
[4050.56 → 4051.12] You who
[4051.12 → 4051.82] were bereaved
[4051.82 → 4052.36] now have
[4052.36 → 4052.74] an heir.
[4053.14 → 4053.56] You who
[4053.56 → 4054.04] were bitter
[4054.04 → 4055.28] now have
[4055.28 → 4055.64] joy.
[4057.28 → 4057.98] When she
[4057.98 → 4058.54] arrived back
[4058.54 → 4059.06] in Israel,
[4059.38 → 4059.78] the whole
[4059.78 → 4060.36] town said,
[4060.46 → 4060.82] can this
[4060.82 → 4061.46] be Naomi?
[4061.46 → 4061.58] Naomi?
[4061.98 → 4062.68] And she
[4062.68 → 4063.24] said, no,
[4063.58 → 4064.34] I went
[4064.34 → 4064.94] ahead and I
[4064.94 → 4065.60] changed my
[4065.60 → 4066.62] name to
[4066.62 → 4066.90] bitterness.
[4068.04 → 4068.86] And now
[4068.86 → 4069.44] they're saying,
[4069.70 → 4069.96] no,
[4070.84 → 4071.90] you are
[4071.90 → 4072.68] Naomi.
[4073.80 → 4074.74] Your name
[4074.74 → 4075.26] is Naomi,
[4075.58 → 4076.34] not bitter,
[4077.30 → 4077.64] pleasant.
[4077.64 → 4079.42] And the
[4079.42 → 4079.94] author of
[4079.94 → 4080.22] the book
[4080.22 → 4080.76] of Ruth
[4080.76 → 4081.26] is saying
[4081.26 → 4081.78] to us,
[4081.90 → 4082.28] I want
[4082.28 → 4082.50] you to
[4082.50 → 4083.06] understand
[4083.06 → 4084.02] what God
[4084.02 → 4084.50] can do.
[4085.20 → 4085.68] I want
[4085.68 → 4085.88] you to
[4085.88 → 4086.22] understand
[4086.22 → 4086.58] what God
[4086.58 → 4086.88] can do.
[4086.96 → 4087.14] That's
[4087.14 → 4087.46] what this
[4087.46 → 4088.18] book is
[4088.18 → 4088.48] about.
[4089.30 → 4089.74] And it's
[4089.74 → 4090.38] not just
[4090.38 → 4090.86] giving
[4090.86 → 4091.44] something to
[4091.44 → 4091.86] Naomi,
[4092.82 → 4093.56] but giving
[4093.56 → 4094.40] through Naomi
[4094.40 → 4094.96] the very
[4094.96 → 4095.74] kingdom of
[4095.74 → 4096.82] God to
[4096.82 → 4097.34] the world.
[4098.46 → 4099.20] Because the
[4099.20 → 4099.78] last line
[4099.78 → 4100.18] of the book
[4100.18 → 4100.62] of Ruth
[4100.62 → 4101.96] reads in
[4101.96 → 4103.10] verse 17.
[4104.10 → 4104.54] It says,
[4104.54 → 4104.90] the women
[4104.90 → 4105.58] living there
[4105.58 → 4105.94] said,
[4106.04 → 4106.68] Naomi has
[4106.68 → 4107.22] a son.
[4107.74 → 4107.94] And they
[4107.94 → 4108.34] named him
[4108.34 → 4108.76] Bed.
[4109.44 → 4109.78] He was
[4109.78 → 4110.28] the father
[4110.28 → 4110.96] of Jesse,
[4111.16 → 4111.58] the father
[4111.58 → 4113.88] of David.
[4115.22 → 4115.94] And then,
[4116.18 → 4117.08] as we read,
[4117.16 → 4117.94] the very first
[4117.94 → 4118.54] line of the
[4118.54 → 4119.04] New Testament
[4119.04 → 4119.76] begins in
[4119.76 → 4120.70] Matthew 1.1.
[4121.14 → 4121.94] This is the
[4121.94 → 4122.78] genealogy of
[4122.78 → 4123.30] Jesus the
[4123.30 → 4123.72] Messiah,
[4124.34 → 4125.02] the son
[4125.02 → 4126.52] of David.
[4127.22 → 4127.72] It's like
[4127.72 → 4128.52] God has been
[4128.52 → 4129.36] sitting on that
[4129.36 → 4130.00] line for a
[4130.00 → 4130.88] thousand years.
[4132.80 → 4133.30] And Jesus
[4133.30 → 4133.90] is born.
[4134.54 → 4135.08] Son of
[4135.08 → 4135.36] David.
[4135.98 → 4136.54] He is
[4136.54 → 4136.78] here.
[4136.88 → 4137.14] He has
[4137.14 → 4137.44] come.
[4138.46 → 4139.04] Because in
[4139.04 → 4139.46] that one
[4139.46 → 4140.16] named David,
[4140.56 → 4141.48] the story is
[4141.48 → 4142.16] no longer
[4142.16 → 4142.70] just about
[4142.70 → 4143.26] these women.
[4143.90 → 4144.26] It's not
[4144.26 → 4144.70] just about
[4144.70 → 4145.16] this child
[4145.16 → 4145.52] Bed.
[4145.66 → 4146.32] It is
[4146.32 → 4146.78] about
[4146.78 → 4147.68] Jesus,
[4148.32 → 4148.74] who has
[4148.74 → 4149.48] come into
[4149.48 → 4150.18] our world
[4150.18 → 4150.96] to rescue
[4150.96 → 4151.44] not just
[4151.44 → 4151.88] Naomi,
[4152.52 → 4152.90] but to
[4152.90 → 4153.52] rescue all
[4153.52 → 4154.00] of us
[4154.00 → 4154.54] and to
[4154.54 → 4155.26] give us
[4155.26 → 4156.06] joy.
[4157.48 → 4158.42] The author
[4158.42 → 4158.90] of Ruth
[4158.90 → 4159.48] is saying,
[4159.96 → 4160.58] what I want
[4160.58 → 4161.14] you to
[4161.14 → 4161.64] understand,
[4161.76 → 4162.26] you people
[4162.26 → 4162.82] of God
[4162.82 → 4163.24] who read
[4163.24 → 4163.56] this,
[4163.86 → 4164.10] is that
[4164.10 → 4164.56] out of
[4164.56 → 4165.32] this loss,
[4165.38 → 4165.66] out of
[4165.66 → 4166.28] this bitterness,
[4166.92 → 4167.94] God can
[4167.94 → 4168.78] bring joy.
[4169.36 → 4170.18] Not just
[4170.18 → 4170.74] for these
[4170.74 → 4171.16] people,
[4171.44 → 4171.88] but for
[4171.88 → 4172.26] the whole
[4172.26 → 4172.64] world.
[4174.28 → 4174.88] And it
[4174.88 → 4175.18] says,
[4175.48 → 4176.28] see what
[4176.28 → 4176.92] God is
[4176.92 → 4177.24] doing.
[4177.88 → 4178.54] See what
[4178.54 → 4179.42] God can
[4179.42 → 4179.72] do.
[4181.50 → 4182.46] And Jesus
[4182.46 → 4183.12] came through
[4183.12 → 4183.82] this amazing
[4183.82 → 4184.86] woman named
[4184.86 → 4185.40] Ruth.
[4186.14 → 4186.78] And it's
[4186.78 → 4187.34] Ruth,
[4187.52 → 4188.26] her character,
[4189.00 → 4189.90] her actions,
[4190.64 → 4191.30] that point
[4191.30 → 4192.48] us to
[4192.48 → 4192.86] Jesus.
[4194.36 → 4194.72] Right?
[4194.80 → 4195.12] Remember,
[4195.30 → 4195.90] Ruth looked
[4195.90 → 4196.88] to Naomi,
[4197.24 → 4198.26] her mother-in-law,
[4198.38 → 4198.72] and said,
[4199.10 → 4199.80] if I stay
[4199.80 → 4200.18] in my
[4200.18 → 4200.62] father's
[4200.62 → 4200.98] house,
[4201.04 → 4201.50] if I go
[4201.50 → 4201.88] back to
[4201.88 → 4202.24] my own
[4202.24 → 4202.66] country,
[4203.40 → 4204.02] Naomi will
[4204.02 → 4204.56] not find
[4204.56 → 4204.96] a home.
[4205.40 → 4205.72] She will
[4205.72 → 4206.30] not find
[4206.30 → 4206.86] rest.
[4207.54 → 4208.02] She will
[4208.02 → 4208.60] not find
[4208.60 → 4208.94] joy.
[4209.78 → 4210.52] I must
[4210.52 → 4210.90] give up
[4210.90 → 4211.62] my life
[4211.62 → 4212.96] to save
[4212.96 → 4213.36] hers.
[4214.36 → 4215.22] So Ruth
[4215.22 → 4215.76] left her
[4215.76 → 4216.16] father's
[4216.16 → 4216.56] house,
[4217.68 → 4218.16] and Ruth
[4218.16 → 4218.76] went into
[4218.76 → 4219.06] a far
[4219.06 → 4219.54] country
[4219.54 → 4220.80] at great
[4220.80 → 4221.26] personal
[4221.26 → 4221.82] cost.
[4222.98 → 4223.60] She became
[4223.60 → 4224.36] an outsider,
[4225.26 → 4225.76] she was
[4225.76 → 4226.34] marginalized,
[4227.68 → 4228.02] and then
[4228.02 → 4228.42] she gave
[4228.42 → 4228.88] birth to
[4228.88 → 4229.28] a child
[4229.28 → 4229.92] in Bethlehem.
[4231.34 → 4232.10] Does that
[4232.10 → 4232.22] sound
[4232.22 → 4232.54] familiar?
[4234.42 → 4235.20] A thousand
[4235.20 → 4235.92] years later,
[4236.62 → 4237.46] another child
[4237.46 → 4237.84] was born
[4237.84 → 4238.50] in Bethlehem,
[4239.66 → 4240.18] Ruth's
[4240.18 → 4240.78] great,
[4240.88 → 4241.10] great,
[4241.18 → 4241.50] great
[4241.50 → 4241.98] grandson
[4241.98 → 4242.40] Jesus,
[4243.52 → 4243.88] who,
[4244.10 → 4244.80] like Ruth,
[4245.62 → 4246.20] would leave
[4246.20 → 4246.78] his father's
[4246.78 → 4248.10] house to
[4248.10 → 4248.80] go into
[4248.80 → 4249.14] a far
[4249.14 → 4249.58] country,
[4250.32 → 4250.78] not from
[4250.78 → 4251.26] Moab to
[4251.26 → 4251.74] Bethlehem,
[4251.80 → 4252.10] but from
[4252.10 → 4252.66] heaven to
[4252.66 → 4253.02] earth,
[4253.60 → 4255.14] at great
[4255.14 → 4255.58] personal
[4255.58 → 4256.08] cost.
[4256.98 → 4257.50] And he
[4257.50 → 4257.78] would be
[4257.78 → 4258.26] rejected,
[4258.84 → 4259.16] and he
[4259.16 → 4259.42] would be
[4259.42 → 4259.88] marginalized,
[4260.42 → 4260.72] and he
[4260.72 → 4261.26] would suffer,
[4261.42 → 4261.62] and he
[4261.62 → 4262.06] would die
[4262.06 → 4262.40] on the
[4262.40 → 4262.84] cross,
[4263.38 → 4263.84] and he
[4263.84 → 4264.20] would give
[4264.20 → 4264.54] up his
[4264.54 → 4264.88] life,
[4264.94 → 4265.30] not just
[4265.30 → 4265.88] for Naomi,
[4266.48 → 4267.26] but for
[4267.26 → 4268.00] all of
[4268.00 → 4268.44] us,
[4269.12 → 4270.10] so that
[4270.10 → 4270.50] we who
[4270.50 → 4271.18] are wandering
[4271.18 → 4272.62] in the
[4272.62 → 4273.20] wilderness of
[4273.20 → 4273.82] this world
[4273.82 → 4275.86] could find
[4275.86 → 4276.18] a true
[4276.18 → 4276.52] home,
[4276.52 → 4277.96] and who
[4277.96 → 4278.54] we who
[4278.54 → 4280.00] have to
[4280.00 → 4280.44] bear the
[4280.44 → 4281.14] darkness and
[4281.14 → 4281.48] the bitterness
[4281.48 → 4281.96] of this
[4281.96 → 4282.74] world could
[4282.74 → 4283.92] find rest
[4283.92 → 4284.66] and joy
[4284.66 → 4286.24] through faith
[4286.24 → 4286.68] in him.
[4287.56 → 4287.88] And friends,
[4287.92 → 4288.32] that is what
[4288.32 → 4289.04] Christmas is all
[4289.04 → 4289.36] about,
[4289.88 → 4290.78] that another
[4290.78 → 4291.46] kinsman
[4291.46 → 4291.94] redeemer
[4291.94 → 4293.68] came,
[4294.64 → 4295.04] that God
[4295.04 → 4295.88] provided another
[4295.88 → 4296.80] child to
[4296.80 → 4298.00] save those
[4298.00 → 4298.66] who were in
[4298.66 → 4298.94] need,
[4299.52 → 4300.04] and that was
[4300.04 → 4300.38] Jesus.
[4301.42 → 4302.00] And that's
[4302.00 → 4302.22] why,
[4302.34 → 4302.48] friends,
[4302.52 → 4302.90] that we can
[4302.90 → 4303.60] trust God
[4303.60 → 4304.22] even in the
[4304.22 → 4304.78] midst of the
[4304.78 → 4305.10] darkness,
[4305.40 → 4306.84] because Jesus,
[4307.02 → 4307.62] the light of
[4307.62 → 4307.96] the world,
[4308.02 → 4308.48] has come.
[4309.06 → 4309.56] He is our
[4309.56 → 4309.94] rescuer,
[4310.08 → 4310.64] he is our
[4310.64 → 4311.32] kinsman
[4311.32 → 4311.80] redeemer,
[4312.28 → 4312.96] and he is
[4312.96 → 4313.38] our joy.
[4315.94 → 4316.86] So I want
[4316.86 → 4318.42] to introduce
[4318.42 → 4319.06] our song of
[4319.06 → 4319.60] response.
[4320.84 → 4321.56] In a moment
[4321.56 → 4321.92] we're going to
[4321.92 → 4322.72] sing this song
[4322.72 → 4323.26] called God
[4323.26 → 4323.88] Moves in a
[4323.88 → 4324.44] Mysterious
[4324.44 → 4324.76] Way.
[4325.48 → 4326.04] It was
[4326.04 → 4326.94] written by
[4326.94 → 4327.66] a man named
[4327.66 → 4328.34] William Cooper,
[4328.80 → 4329.80] who was a
[4329.80 → 4330.52] close friend of
[4330.52 → 4331.12] John Newton,
[4332.08 → 4332.62] who, if you
[4332.62 → 4332.90] know,
[4332.90 → 4334.48] wrote Amazing
[4334.48 → 4334.90] Grace.
[4335.94 → 4336.18] Now,
[4336.30 → 4336.94] William Cooper
[4336.94 → 4338.32] suffered from
[4338.32 → 4339.44] depression for
[4339.44 → 4340.12] most of his
[4340.12 → 4340.48] life.
[4341.42 → 4342.24] And you see it
[4342.24 → 4342.88] come out in his
[4342.88 → 4343.24] poetry.
[4343.40 → 4343.98] He wrote poems
[4343.98 → 4344.66] and hymns.
[4346.08 → 4346.86] But on one
[4346.86 → 4347.58] occasion, he was
[4347.58 → 4348.86] so depressed, he
[4348.86 → 4349.52] wanted to end
[4349.52 → 4350.16] his own life.
[4351.18 → 4352.18] And this hymn
[4352.18 → 4352.88] that we're about
[4352.88 → 4354.02] to sing came
[4354.02 → 4354.56] out of that
[4354.56 → 4355.24] experience.
[4356.16 → 4356.84] So the hymn
[4356.84 → 4357.54] begins,
[4358.64 → 4360.12] God moves in
[4360.12 → 4360.68] a mysterious
[4360.68 → 4362.44] way his
[4362.44 → 4364.22] wonders to
[4364.22 → 4364.72] perform.
[4365.94 → 4366.34] And then he
[4366.34 → 4367.00] goes on to
[4367.00 → 4368.20] encourage us as
[4368.20 → 4369.10] fearful saints.
[4369.98 → 4370.62] He says,
[4370.72 → 4371.18] you fearful
[4371.18 → 4372.16] saints, fresh
[4372.16 → 4373.18] courage take.
[4373.86 → 4374.84] The clouds you
[4374.84 → 4375.74] so much dread
[4375.74 → 4376.80] are big with
[4376.80 → 4378.10] mercy and
[4378.10 → 4379.00] shall break in
[4379.00 → 4380.62] blessings on
[4380.62 → 4381.06] your head.
[4382.64 → 4382.94] And then
[4382.94 → 4383.64] warning us not
[4383.64 → 4384.66] to think wrongly
[4384.66 → 4385.56] about God, he
[4385.56 → 4386.36] says, judge not
[4386.36 → 4387.62] the Lord by
[4387.62 → 4388.58] feeble sense,
[4388.66 → 4388.78] right?
[4388.78 → 4389.76] Just by our
[4389.76 → 4390.72] experience or what
[4390.72 → 4391.32] we can see in
[4391.32 → 4391.78] this world.
[4392.34 → 4393.08] But trust him
[4393.08 → 4393.92] for his grace.
[4395.00 → 4395.88] Behind a
[4395.88 → 4396.50] frowning
[4396.50 → 4398.36] providence, he
[4398.36 → 4399.60] hides a
[4399.60 → 4400.42] smiling face.
[4401.60 → 4402.40] So let's pray
[4402.40 → 4403.58] together and
[4403.58 → 4404.68] then let's sing
[4404.68 → 4405.70] together the
[4405.70 → 4406.02] song of
[4406.02 → 4406.50] response.
[4408.98 → 4409.48] Heavenly
[4409.48 → 4410.02] Father, we
[4410.02 → 4410.62] thank you for
[4410.62 → 4412.80] Ruth, a
[4412.80 → 4413.56] steadfast,
[4414.34 → 4416.04] self-sacrificing
[4416.04 → 4419.18] woman who
[4419.18 → 4419.86] was faithful
[4419.86 → 4420.58] to Naomi,
[4421.42 → 4423.18] who gave
[4423.18 → 4424.04] of her life
[4424.04 → 4424.54] so that
[4424.54 → 4425.16] Naomi could
[4425.16 → 4425.54] live.
[4426.88 → 4427.30] And Father,
[4427.38 → 4427.88] we thank you
[4427.88 → 4428.54] for Jesus
[4428.54 → 4429.38] who came and
[4429.38 → 4430.12] like his
[4430.12 → 4430.74] great-great
[4430.74 → 4431.18] grandmother
[4431.18 → 4433.36] Ruth, Jesus
[4433.36 → 4434.04] came to be
[4434.04 → 4434.80] the true and
[4434.80 → 4435.42] better Ruth
[4435.42 → 4436.10] who not only
[4436.10 → 4436.94] gave himself
[4436.94 → 4438.42] for one
[4438.42 → 4439.36] mother-in-law
[4439.36 → 4440.02] but who gave
[4440.02 → 4441.30] himself for
[4441.30 → 4442.10] all of us.
[4443.16 → 4444.10] He came into
[4444.10 → 4444.96] our darkness
[4444.96 → 4446.60] and he came
[4446.60 → 4447.34] to bring light
[4447.34 → 4448.02] and life
[4448.02 → 4449.08] and joy
[4449.08 → 4450.06] that even
[4450.06 → 4450.82] while we still
[4450.82 → 4451.52] dwell in
[4451.52 → 4453.36] Advent, that
[4453.36 → 4453.90] Christmas is
[4453.90 → 4454.18] coming.
[4455.28 → 4456.08] Jesus has
[4456.08 → 4456.94] come, the
[4456.94 → 4457.46] light has
[4457.46 → 4459.02] come, and
[4459.02 → 4460.06] darkness is
[4460.06 → 4460.72] being vanished
[4460.72 → 4461.34] and the curse
[4461.34 → 4461.98] is being lifted
[4461.98 → 4463.24] as far as
[4463.24 → 4463.90] it is found
[4463.90 → 4464.40] in all the
[4464.40 → 4464.76] world.
[4465.42 → 4466.04] Lord, would
[4466.04 → 4467.60] you call more
[4467.60 → 4469.56] people everywhere
[4469.56 → 4470.72] Lord, to
[4470.72 → 4472.16] become not
[4472.16 → 4473.00] outsiders but
[4473.00 → 4473.94] insiders of
[4473.94 → 4474.38] your family
[4474.38 → 4474.90] through faith
[4474.90 → 4475.38] in Christ.
[4476.44 → 4476.70] And Lord,
[4476.78 → 4477.40] help each one
[4477.40 → 4478.06] of us who
[4478.06 → 4479.06] in the own
[4479.06 → 4479.68] darkness of
[4479.68 → 4480.50] our circumstances
[4480.50 → 4483.16] to see your
[4483.16 → 4484.38] smiling providence.
[4485.64 → 4486.48] We pray in
[4486.48 → 4487.02] Jesus' name.
[4487.30 → 4487.54] Amen.
[4488.78 → 4489.68] Let's all stand
[4489.68 → 4490.28] and let's sing
[4490.28 → 4491.04] this song together.
[4495.34 → 4496.34] This song was
[4496.34 → 4497.38] first published
[4497.38 → 4498.38] in 1872
[4498.38 → 4500.00] with a different
[4500.00 → 4500.72] melody that you
[4500.72 → 4501.66] may have sung.
[4501.66 → 4503.14] this melody
[4503.14 → 4503.72] was written
[4503.72 → 4504.20] by Graham
[4504.20 → 4504.62] Kendrick
[4504.62 → 4505.78] who gave
[4505.78 → 4506.26] a shine
[4506.26 → 4507.24] Jesus shine
[4507.24 → 4507.78] if you remember
[4507.78 → 4508.28] that one.
[4508.66 → 4509.18] So this is a
[4509.18 → 4509.66] new setting
[4509.66 → 4511.12] for these words
[4511.12 → 4511.86] that date back
[4511.86 → 4512.82] to 1872.
[4512.82 → 4530.30] God moves in a
[4530.30 → 4531.70] mysterious way
[4531.70 → 4533.08] His wonders
[4533.08 → 4535.36] to the fall
[4535.36 → 4536.74] He
[4536.74 → 4538.84] He
[4538.84 → 4539.42] plants
[4539.42 → 4539.74] His
[4539.74 → 4540.32] footsteps
[4540.32 → 4541.30] in the
[4541.30 → 4541.84] sea
[4541.84 → 4542.26] and
[4542.26 → 4542.86] rides
[4542.86 → 4543.68] upon
[4543.68 → 4544.34] the
[4544.34 → 4545.68] storm
[4545.68 → 4548.28] He
[4548.28 → 4552.24] He
[4552.24 → 4552.26] He
[4552.26 → 4563.66] treasures up
[4563.66 → 4564.44] His bright
[4564.44 → 4565.08] design
[4565.08 → 4566.22] and works
[4566.22 → 4567.58] His sovereign
[4567.58 → 4568.32] will
[4568.32 → 4573.20] Take courage
[4573.20 → 4575.12] God
[4575.12 → 4575.44] in Christ
[4575.44 → 4576.52] He
[4576.52 → 4576.88] needs
[4576.88 → 4579.16] He
[4579.16 → 4579.60] remember
[4579.60 → 4580.90] His
[4580.90 → 4582.44] gold
[4586.44 → 4587.04] He
[4587.04 → 4587.44] patched
[4587.44 → 4588.46] on
[4588.46 → 4589.32] Kings
[4589.32 → 4590.36] in
[4590.36 → 4597.44] And I will trust the wounds of Calvary.
[4599.22 → 4604.70] And I will trust, and I will not be afraid.
[4607.28 → 4611.54] For all his ways are gone.
[4611.54 → 4625.30] Judge not the Lord by feeble sins, but trust him for his grace.
[4627.84 → 4635.66] Behind a frowning alliance, he hides a smiling face.
[4635.66 → 4645.42] His purposes will widen fast, unfolding every hour.
[4645.76 → 4652.10] The blood may have a bitter taste, but sweet will be a flower.
[4652.50 → 4658.52] And I will trust the hands that lay to starry heavens.
[4658.52 → 4664.10] And I will trust the wounds of Calvary.
[4665.66 → 4671.22] And I will trust, and I will not be afraid.
[4672.86 → 4678.98] And I will trust the hands that lay to starry heavens.
[4679.80 → 4684.66] And I will trust the wounds of Calvary.
[4684.66 → 4692.10] And I will trust, and I will not be afraid.
[4695.66 → 4698.86] Not be afraid.
[4698.86 → 4701.66] Not be afraid.
[4701.66 → 4706.66] Not be afraid.
[4706.66 → 4715.12] For all his ways are gone.
[4717.86 → 4721.62] For all his ways are gone.
[4721.62 → 4731.62] For all his praise are the Lord
[4751.62 → 4767.62] Our offering today is for Delta Hospice Society, a community-based organization that helps individuals and their families with palliative care live with comfort, meaning, dignity, and hope at the end of life.
[4767.62 → 4771.62] The deacons can come up.
[4781.62 → 4797.62] The deacons can come up.
[4797.62 → 4803.62] The deacons can come up.
[4803.62 → 4813.62] The deacons can come up.
[4813.62 → 4819.62] The deacons can come up.
[4819.62 → 4825.62] The deacons can come up.
[4825.62 → 4847.62] The deacons can come up.
[4847.62 → 4848.62] Amen.
[4877.62 → 4879.62] Amen.
[4907.62 → 4909.62] Amen.
[4937.62 → 4939.62] Amen.
[4967.62 → 4969.62] Amen.
[4969.62 → 4971.62] Amen.
[4971.62 → 4972.62] Amen.
[4972.62 → 4981.72] Our community prayer today is based on the Ten Commandments, and it was written by a pastor
[4981.72 → 4984.44] in the Christian Reformed Church.
[4984.44 → 4986.44] Shall we pray?
[4986.44 → 4994.42] Dear Heavenly God and Father, we praise you, and thank you for sending your Son, Jesus,
[4994.42 → 4997.60] to earth to save us from our sins.
[4997.60 → 5005.76] In this time of Advent, we look forward to the hope, peace, joy, and love that Jesus brings.
[5005.76 → 5009.80] Heavenly Father, you are God, and there is no other.
[5009.80 → 5013.96] But we confess that sometimes we follow false gods.
[5013.96 → 5019.78] We trust in wealth or work or one another to provide for us instead of you.
[5019.78 → 5021.16] Forgive us.
[5021.16 → 5024.82] Help us worship, serve, and honour you with all our hearts.
[5024.82 → 5028.02] In the name of Jesus, our Saviour, we pray.
[5028.02 → 5033.98] Heavenly Father, you call us to worship in spirit and in truth, bringing you our praises and
[5033.98 → 5034.98] prayer.
[5034.98 → 5039.14] But we confess that we often make our worship more about ourselves and what we want than
[5039.14 → 5041.14] about you and what you want.
[5041.14 → 5043.14] Please forgive us.
[5043.14 → 5048.20] Help our worship honour you for what you have done and how you have made yourself known
[5048.20 → 5050.22] to us through Jesus, our Saviour.
[5050.22 → 5057.38] Father, our God, we confess that we often misuse your name.
[5057.38 → 5062.16] Sometimes we use your name without thinking or when we are angry or to make ourselves seem
[5062.16 → 5064.16] more impressive.
[5064.16 → 5067.42] Help us to praise and glorify you with respect.
[5067.42 → 5073.48] May our lives as Christians reflect well on you, bringing honour to the name of Christ Jesus,
[5073.48 → 5075.58] our Saviour.
[5075.58 → 5080.12] Heavenly Father, you promise to provide for us, and you give us the gift of rest.
[5080.12 → 5084.46] But so often we place our trust in our own work and our own efforts.
[5084.46 → 5086.62] Help us to set aside time for you.
[5086.62 → 5093.28] Teach us to rest and rely on you and so build up our trust in you through Jesus.
[5093.28 → 5097.74] Heavenly Father, you place parents and other authority figures in our lives to train us
[5097.74 → 5100.64] to do good and to keep us from evil.
[5100.64 → 5106.98] But often we disobey or ignore our parents and disrespect or insult the authorities.
[5106.98 → 5112.26] Help us honour and submit to proper authority and use our authority responsibly through Jesus,
[5112.26 → 5114.76] our Saviour.
[5114.76 → 5116.88] Heavenly Father, you created us in your image.
[5116.88 → 5118.94] Our lives are precious to you.
[5118.94 → 5122.34] But we have so many ways of harming each other.
[5122.34 → 5128.58] Often we let hatred, revenge, and unjustified anger simmer in our hearts.
[5128.58 → 5132.84] In doing these things, we really begin to walk the path of murder.
[5132.84 → 5134.16] Please forgive us.
[5134.16 → 5138.02] Help us to love, protect, and do good to one another.
[5138.02 → 5140.52] In the name of Jesus.
[5140.52 → 5143.46] Heavenly Father, you created us male and female.
[5143.46 → 5146.90] We are not the only one who gave us the gifts of marriage and sex, but we confess that we
[5146.90 → 5150.04] do not always live faithfully with these gifts.
[5150.04 → 5151.04] Please forgive us.
[5151.04 → 5155.58] Help us to be pure in body and soul.
[5155.58 → 5161.32] Heavenly Father, the earth is yours and everything in it, and the world and all who live in it.
[5161.32 → 5164.68] We confess that we are often greedy, wanting more and more.
[5164.68 → 5166.04] Please forgive us.
[5166.04 → 5171.16] Help us make good use of your gifts to help others as well as ourselves.
[5171.16 → 5173.62] Through Jesus, our Saviour.
[5173.62 → 5178.62] Heavenly Father, you call us to walk in truth, but we confess that we are often all too comfortable
[5178.62 → 5180.26] with lies.
[5180.26 → 5181.16] Please forgive us.
[5181.16 → 5187.30] Help us to speak the truth and use our words to encourage others and protect their reputations.
[5187.30 → 5190.10] In the name of Jesus.
[5190.10 → 5195.30] Good and gracious Father, you created this good world and teach us how to live in it,
[5195.30 → 5199.40] but we confess that our desires are often sinful.
[5199.40 → 5204.94] We do not desire you and your good spiritual gifts as much as we should.
[5204.94 → 5206.64] Please forgive us.
[5206.64 → 5209.76] Give us a well-ordered heart and proper desires.
[5209.76 → 5212.80] Through Jesus, our Saviour.
[5212.80 → 5218.00] Heavenly Father, we pray for those in our congregation who need your care and presence.
[5218.00 → 5227.26] Please be with Fawn, Eileen, Richie, Pat, Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Jerry, and Ann, Quinn,
[5227.26 → 5233.14] Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, Henry, and John, and grant them what they need.
[5233.14 → 5237.22] We pray for continued healing for Pastor Nancy and Grace.
[5237.22 → 5242.52] Be with Jordan and Vanessa and their family as Jordan continues with his treatment for cancer.
[5242.52 → 5245.46] We pray for his complete healing.
[5245.46 → 5249.80] And we ask for healing for Pat Beatnik's granddaughter, Grace.
[5249.80 → 5253.72] Please be with those whose illnesses and struggles are not known to us.
[5253.72 → 5258.18] You know them, Lord, and are able to comfort and heal them.
[5258.18 → 5262.18] We pray that you will be with this world and the terrible events that are happening now in
[5262.18 → 5263.94] so many countries.
[5263.94 → 5270.32] We pray for your guidance especially in ending the conflicts in Ukraine, Iran, and Ethiopia.
[5270.32 → 5274.26] Please be with their leaders, so there will be peace and justice.
[5274.26 → 5278.60] We bring this all before you in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[5278.60 → 5280.60] Amen.
[5280.60 → 5294.04] Thank you, Elaine, for leading us in that prayer.
[5294.04 → 5303.10] Let's all rise, and we go out from this time of worship with the Lord's blessing, his good words,
[5303.60 → 5305.28] his benediction upon us.
[5305.28 → 5309.44] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[5309.44 → 5313.72] May the peace of the Lord be with you.
[5313.72 → 5320.00] May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and may the love of God the Father and the fellowship
[5320.00 → 5324.84] of the Holy Spirit be with you and be yours now and forever.
[5324.84 → 5325.12] Amen.
[5325.12 → 5329.02] Amen.
[5329.02 → 5331.02] Amen.
[5359.02 → 5361.02] Amen.
[5389.02 → 5391.02] Amen.
[5419.02 → 5421.02] Amen.
[5449.02 → 5451.02] Amen.
