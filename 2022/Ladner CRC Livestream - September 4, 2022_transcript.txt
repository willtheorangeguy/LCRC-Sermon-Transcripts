[298.16 --> 300.16]  Good morning.
[300.16 --> 301.16]  Good morning.
[301.16 --> 306.16]  My name is Ryan, and I'd like to welcome you to Ladner Christian Reformed Church this Sunday.
[306.16 --> 312.16]  It's a joyous occasion to gather together to worship the Lord Jesus, our God and our Redeemer.
[312.16 --> 322.16]  If you are new here or just visiting, I'd like to extend a special welcome and an invitation to join us for coffee and fellowship at the hall at the back of the church after the service.
[322.16 --> 326.16]  Community is important to us, and we'd love to get to know you.
[326.16 --> 335.16]  Jason is away this Sunday, so this morning we're going to be inviting Pastor Chelsea Harmon to the pulpit to bring us God's word.
[335.16 --> 339.16]  Now let us turn our hearts and minds to the worship of our Creator.
[339.16 --> 345.16]  Please stand if you are able to join me in our responsive call to worship from Psalm 100.
[345.16 --> 346.16]  Let us pray.
[346.16 --> 347.16]  Let us pray.
[347.16 --> 348.16]  Let us pray.
[348.16 --> 349.16]  Let us pray.
[349.16 --> 352.16]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[352.16 --> 354.16]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[354.16 --> 357.16]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[357.16 --> 360.16]  Know that the Lord is God.
[360.16 --> 364.16]  It is he who made us, and we are his.
[364.16 --> 368.16]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[368.16 --> 372.16]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise.
[372.16 --> 376.16]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[376.16 --> 381.16]  For the Lord is good, and his love endures forever.
[381.16 --> 385.16]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[385.16 --> 389.16]  In Christ, the God of heaven, made his home on earth.
[389.16 --> 392.16]  Christ dwells among us, and is one with us.
[392.16 --> 395.16]  Highest of all creation, he lives among the least.
[395.16 --> 398.16]  He journeys with the rejected, and welcomes the weary.
[398.16 --> 402.16]  Come now, all who thirst, and drink the water of life.
[402.16 --> 405.16]  Come now, all who hunger, and be filled with good things.
[405.16 --> 410.16]  Come now, all who seek, and be warmed by the fire of his love.
[410.16 --> 420.16]  Let us take a moment to greet each other, our pew neighbours, before we join together in singing God's praise.

[508.24 --> 520.24]  Hail Him who saved you by His grace, and call Him Lord of all.
[520.24 --> 534.24]  Hail Him who saved you by His grace, and call Him Lord of all.
[534.24 --> 545.24]  Let every tongue and every tribe of His terrestrial boy,
[545.24 --> 557.24]  To Him all majesty astride, and crown Him Lord of all.
[557.24 --> 572.24]  To Him all majesty astride, and crown Him Lord of all.

[584.24 --> 597.24]  Will join me in the voices of, and crown Him Lord of all.
[597.24 --> 615.24]  Will join me in the voices of, and crown Him Lord of all.
[615.24 --> 618.24]  Amen. You may be seated for their next song.
[618.24 --> 637.24]  This next song, Ancient Words, chorus says, Ancient Words ever true,

[641.24 --> 656.24]  O let the ancient words impart.

[677.24 --> 687.24]  Words of life, words of hope, give us strength, help us go.
[687.24 --> 696.24]  In this world, where e'er we roam, ancient words will guide us whole.
[696.24 --> 706.24]  Ancient words ever true, changing me and changing you.
[706.24 --> 717.24]  We have come with open hearts, O let the ancient words impart.

[822.70 --> 834.94]  Part of what we do is worship through thanksgiving, and this song is giving thanks for God is true and loving forever and forever.
[834.94 --> 835.94]  Thank you.

[836.94 --> 837.94]  Thank you.
[837.94 --> 838.94]  Thank you.
[838.94 --> 840.94]  Thank you.
[840.94 --> 841.94]  Thank you.
[841.94 --> 843.94]  Thank you.
[844.04 --> 844.94]  Thank you.
[844.94 --> 847.94]  Thank you.
[847.94 --> 849.94]  Thank you.
[850.04 --> 850.94]  Thank you.
[851.04 --> 851.94]  Thank you.
[851.94 --> 852.94]  Thank you.
[852.94 --> 869.94]  Thank you.
[869.94 --> 875.78]  And I'll stretch on His love endures forever.
[877.20 --> 884.12]  For the life that's been reborn, His love endures forever.
[884.12 --> 899.94]  Sing praise, sing praise, sing praise.
[901.44 --> 908.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong.
[908.90 --> 918.90]  Forever God is with us, forever, forever.
[921.90 --> 929.28]  The Christ is the Lord, the Son, His love endures forever.
[929.28 --> 937.78]  And by the grace of God, we will carry on His love endures forever.
[938.90 --> 944.90]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[946.90 --> 952.90]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[952.90 --> 962.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong.
[962.90 --> 968.90]  Forever God is with us, forever.
[972.90 --> 982.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong.
[982.90 --> 992.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever.
[992.90 --> 994.90]  Forever.
[994.90 --> 996.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever.
[996.90 --> 1000.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever.
[1000.90 --> 1002.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever.
[1002.90 --> 1004.90]  Forever God is faithful, forever.
[1004.90 --> 1006.90]  It's great that we could keep the kids there for that last one.
[1006.90 --> 1010.90]  Something about that tambourine just makes you want to dance.
[1010.90 --> 1015.90]  At this point, though, the kids ages three through grade five can head off to kids life.
[1015.90 --> 1016.90]  Jesus said,
[1016.90 --> 1022.90]  Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
[1022.90 --> 1026.90]  May you and your teachers be blessed as you go and worship God in your own special way.
[1026.90 --> 1040.90]  You have heard that it is said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[1040.90 --> 1048.90]  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
[1048.90 --> 1055.90]  He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[1055.90 --> 1059.90]  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?
[1059.90 --> 1061.90]  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[1061.90 --> 1065.90]  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?
[1065.90 --> 1068.90]  Do not even the pagans do that?
[1068.90 --> 1073.90]  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[1073.90 --> 1077.90]  Sounds like a bit of a tall order. Be perfect.
[1077.90 --> 1079.90]  It's as simple as that, right?
[1079.90 --> 1080.90]  So how are we doing?
[1080.90 --> 1087.90]  The Heidelberg Catechism, with all the bedside manner you'd expect from a 16th century German confession, puts it pretty bluntly.
[1087.90 --> 1094.90]  We are inclined by nature to not only hate our loved ones and our neighbor, but to hate God himself.
[1094.90 --> 1101.90]  In fact, we are so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil.
[1101.90 --> 1103.90]  Not a good start for humanity.
[1103.90 --> 1107.90]  But if you've been here a few times, you already know the good news.
[1107.90 --> 1119.90]  Two thousand years ago, God sent His Son, fully man yet fully God, to a backwater village at the edge of the Roman Empire, to live a perfect life and then to suffer and die on a cross for us.
[1119.90 --> 1122.90]  As 1 Peter writes,
[1122.90 --> 1152.90] 
[1152.90 --> 1155.90]  Let us pray.
[1155.90 --> 1162.90]  Heavenly Father, thank you for your example of living perfectly and for your sacrifice on the cross.
[1162.90 --> 1165.90]  All good things come from you, Lord.
[1165.90 --> 1169.90]  Help us to be loving, merciful, kind and welcoming.
[1169.90 --> 1175.90]  Walk with us daily so we can build our lives around your goodness, serving others as you have served us.
[1175.90 --> 1177.90]  In Jesus name we pray.
[1177.90 --> 1178.90]  Amen.
[1178.90 --> 1182.90]  Let us sing of that assurance by singing Great is Thy Faithfulness.
[1182.90 --> 1198.90]  I think I'll have you stand for this one.
[1198.90 --> 1199.90]  Next one.
[1199.90 --> 1200.90]  Thank you.
[1200.90 --> 1201.90]  Thank you.
[1201.90 --> 1202.90]  Thank you.
[1202.90 --> 1203.90]  Thank you.
[1203.90 --> 1204.90]  Thank you.
[1204.90 --> 1205.90]  Thank you.
[1205.90 --> 1206.90]  Thank you.
[1206.90 --> 1207.90]  Thank you.
[1207.90 --> 1208.90]  Thank you.
[1208.90 --> 1210.90]  Thank you.
[1210.90 --> 1212.90]  Thank you.
[1212.90 --> 1213.90]  Thank you.
[1213.90 --> 1218.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness, O God's like Father.
[1218.90 --> 1221.90]  There is no shadow of the sea.
[1221.90 --> 1231.90]  There is no shadow of the sea.
[1231.90 --> 1238.90]  The changes, God, and all passions, they fill God.
[1238.90 --> 1246.90]  The still has been the forever one's been.
[1246.90 --> 1254.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness.

[1263.90 --> 1271.90]  All I have needed, the Lamb of the Father,
[1271.90 --> 1280.90]  with His faithfulness, for unto me.
[1280.90 --> 1286.90]  Summer and winter and spring,
[1286.90 --> 1297.90]  nigh and marvelous, sun-loved and starved in their courses of art.
[1297.90 --> 1305.90]  Joined with all nature in manifold ignorance,
[1305.90 --> 1313.90]  to Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[1313.90 --> 1322.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness,
[1322.90 --> 1330.90]  for in Thy glory, in mercies I sing.
[1330.90 --> 1338.90]  All I have needed, the Lamb of the Lord,
[1338.90 --> 1347.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1347.90 --> 1357.90]  Pardon for sin and a peace that end forever.
[1357.90 --> 1364.90]  Thine own, dear presence, here and to God.
[1364.90 --> 1372.90]  Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[1372.90 --> 1381.90]  Blessings all my ten thousand praise,
[1381.90 --> 1385.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,

[1389.90 --> 1396.90]  For in my glory, in mercies I sing.
[1396.90 --> 1405.90]  All I have needed, the Lamb of the Father,
[1405.90 --> 1412.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, and spring.
[1412.90 --> 1413.90]  The chorus again.
[1413.90 --> 1414.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,
[1414.90 --> 1415.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,
[1415.90 --> 1418.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,
[1418.90 --> 1419.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,
[1419.90 --> 1422.90]  Great is Thy faithfulness,
[1422.90 --> 1427.90]  For in my glory, in mercies I sing.
[1427.90 --> 1437.90]  All I have needed, Thy light hath provided.
[1437.90 --> 1454.90]  All I have needed, the Lord, and spring.
[1454.90 --> 1457.90]  Thank you. You may be seated.
[1462.90 --> 1464.90]  Our scripture reading this morning comes from Luke 14,
[1464.90 --> 1468.66]  which will be above me on the screen here as well as in the pew bibles in front of you
[1468.66 --> 1478.18]  one sabbath when jesus went to eat at the house of a prominent pharisee he was being carefully
[1478.18 --> 1483.12]  watched when he noticed how the guest picked places of honor at the table he told them this
[1483.12 --> 1488.72]  parable when someone invites you to a wedding feast do not take the place of honor for a person
[1488.72 --> 1494.88]  more distinguished than you may have been invited if so the host who invited both of you will come
[1494.88 --> 1501.52]  to you and say give this person your seat then humiliated you'll have to take the least important
[1501.52 --> 1507.00]  place but when you're invited take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he will say
[1507.00 --> 1512.82]  friend move up to a better place then you will be honored in the presence of all the guests all the
[1512.82 --> 1518.64]  other guests for those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be
[1518.64 --> 1524.38]  exalted then jesus said to his host when you give a luncheon or a dinner do not invite your friends
[1524.38 --> 1530.50]  your brothers or sisters your relatives or your rich neighbors if you do they may invite you back
[1530.50 --> 1537.00]  and so you will be repaid but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind
[1537.00 --> 1542.82]  and you will be blessed although they cannot repay you you will be repaid at the resurrection
[1542.82 --> 1546.82]  of the righteous this is the word of the lord
[1546.82 --> 1554.56]  this point i'd like to welcome pastor chelsea to the pulpit chelsea joins us from regent college
[1554.56 --> 1560.82]  among other places uh also recently of uh ninaimo i believe so welcome pastor chelsea thank you
[1560.82 --> 1562.02]  amen
[1562.02 --> 1569.38]  let's pray together
[1569.38 --> 1578.46]  having heard your word oh lord we pray that your spirit will enliven us with their meaning so that
[1578.46 --> 1586.20]  we might become more like christ the one who told the story but more fully even lived this story
[1586.20 --> 1594.20]  we thank you god our father god the son and god the holy spirit for continuing to guide us and to be
[1594.20 --> 1603.32]  the source of not only wisdom but of true righteousness and the promise of the new heaven and new earth
[1603.32 --> 1606.52]  in jesus name we pray amen
[1606.52 --> 1612.84]  so i recently got engaged and yeah thank you
[1612.84 --> 1620.20]  i did i'm not telling you because i want you to clap but that's okay uh but one of the things that i just
[1620.20 --> 1626.24]  wish is that we could get to the party part like all of the planning and all the work and like the
[1626.24 --> 1632.02]  decisions about who gets to be invited and like wow it's a lot of money you have to spend to get married
[1632.02 --> 1638.10]  these days it seems like all of those things i just wish i could pass them over and get to the wedding
[1638.10 --> 1646.90]  banquet feast and jesus also seems to really like telling stories about the wedding banquet have you
[1646.90 --> 1653.46]  ever noticed in the gospels how many times he tells a story about the wedding feast that is to come
[1654.10 --> 1661.46]  about how many times he uses this imagery of the party of people being brought together to celebrate
[1661.46 --> 1668.34]  a covenanted relationship with one another as the setting for teaching deep truths about what
[1668.34 --> 1675.78]  matters and is valuable to god how often he uses the wedding banquet feast as not only this thing that
[1675.78 --> 1681.06]  we get to look forward to but as a source of wisdom for how we're to live in the present
[1681.86 --> 1686.66]  and then i'm reminded that the way i'm thinking about my wedding is a lot different than jesus is
[1686.66 --> 1693.46]  thinking about the wedding feast of the lamb and i'm brought back down to my senses for a moment and
[1693.46 --> 1703.62]  i'm reminded that wisdom is not just about the end wisdom is about how we live leading up to that moment
[1703.62 --> 1712.26]  wisdom is given to us for this journey and this time that we are here on earth and when pastor jan
[1712.26 --> 1725.70]  richardson who's also a poet and an artist when she reads this story she describes it as just as displaying to us the endless wisdom that god has of the table
[1726.50 --> 1735.86]  this image that we're reminded of every week when we come to the sanctuary here as we see the table of the lord that we are gathered together for at communion
[1736.58 --> 1749.46]  as we remember that this table looks to the past of what god has done but also to the future of that wedding feast in heaven when the new heaven and the new earth are ushered in and all of life is a banquet
[1750.34 --> 1753.54]  celebrating the love of god
[1755.62 --> 1763.30]  the endless wisdom of the table that tells us between these two things is how we live our lives in the here and now
[1763.30 --> 1768.10]  how we model the way of christ who told this story
[1769.06 --> 1774.98]  so this morning we're going to think about these pieces of wisdom that apply not only to the ways that
[1774.98 --> 1783.70]  we invite people to our dinner tables but to the way in which we live our very lives as people who follow after jesus christ
[1783.70 --> 1795.38]  so the first piece of wisdom did you notice in our text how the emphasis is on the fact that we are invited
[1796.58 --> 1803.54]  that those who are invited if you have been invited the one who's doing the inviting over and over the repetition
[1803.54 --> 1811.46]  of this word invitation of this word invitation is present and it is a reminder to us that here in this world
[1812.42 --> 1824.10]  we are guests of god we are guests of god perpetually we are god's invitation
[1824.10 --> 1840.90]  to the world and the world is god's invitation to us to live with his wisdom to live with his fruit of the spirit to live with his values
[1842.26 --> 1850.18]  to live with his wedding feast in mind now there's a lot of comfort that comes with knowing that you are at home
[1850.18 --> 1857.30]  perhaps here in this worship space there's comfort for you and knowing what to expect every sunday when you come to this place
[1857.30 --> 1863.22]  because this is your home and over time you might forget that you are still the guest of god
[1864.02 --> 1869.62]  in this space it's a lesson that i've had to learn a lot so since i stopped pastoring full-time
[1869.62 --> 1874.66]  and went back to school i've been doing a lot more pulpit supply and so i've been visiting a lot more churches
[1874.66 --> 1880.66]  uh that i've not i've never been to before and i've had to learn to give up some control about how
[1880.66 --> 1886.90]  the worship services should go and should be in my theological opinion which you know shouldn't matter
[1886.90 --> 1895.38]  some i've got an mdiv and all uh to be told to just receive the gifts that are going to happen in a place
[1895.38 --> 1905.14]  and in a community very different from my own that going and being a guest has gifts to give
[1906.58 --> 1910.90]  experiences to receive wisdom to see lived out
[1913.30 --> 1920.74]  but if i'm not willing to see myself and understand myself as god's guests in the place places that i go
[1920.74 --> 1925.78]  in this world i'm going to miss those opportunities because i'm going to be too focused on what i'm
[1925.78 --> 1934.02]  supposed to be doing to receive it you know what i mean when you're like worried about whether or not
[1934.02 --> 1940.42]  you've done the right things that you miss out on the fun that's happening around you you miss out on
[1940.42 --> 1947.38]  the lessons that are available to you when you're distracted by especially the worry about whether or not
[1947.38 --> 1957.46]  you belong whether or not you're good enough to be there but you've been invited and the one who invites
[1957.46 --> 1968.98]  you has invited you because he loves you because he wants you there we have been invited by god to live
[1968.98 --> 1981.22]  full lives with the spirit live full lives in the echo of jesus the image that we follow the image of
[1981.22 --> 1989.14]  the invisible god who's come to earth to make everyone know that they are invited to know god's grace and
[1989.14 --> 1996.90]  god's mercy and god's peace and god's joy and god's delight learning to be a guest
[1996.90 --> 2007.94]  will give you plenty of experiences to grow in god's wisdom and learning that you are always the guest of god
[2008.58 --> 2018.82]  leads automatically to humility and not over assuming your importance in place it's it's like a built-in fail safe
[2018.82 --> 2031.22]  notice how jesus describes what happens when you think too highly of yourself and go and sit at the best seat in the house next to the host
[2033.06 --> 2041.78]  he says there's gonna be an awkward conversation where the host has to go tell you that someone is more deserving of the place that you think you belong
[2041.78 --> 2055.22]  and be chastised and rebuked publicly which is what jesus over and over and over what god the father
[2055.22 --> 2064.98]  through the prophet said over and over and over is what happens to those who have who cannot ignore this human
[2064.98 --> 2073.46]  tendency that we just confessed about to force their own grandeur and place in the world
[2077.06 --> 2084.74]  god brings down those who lift themselves up but raises the humble
[2087.62 --> 2092.74]  now the the guest who goes and sits in the best seat of the house they are basically saying to everyone else
[2092.74 --> 2101.06]  that comes if our host could only have one person at this party it'd be me by choosing
[2102.42 --> 2109.30]  i chose i went to a dead spot i'm back okay by choosing to sit in the best seat of the house they're
[2109.30 --> 2114.02]  they're not just communicating something about themselves they're commuting communicating what they
[2114.02 --> 2122.26]  think of everyone else in the space they're not taking the posture of a guest who understands that there's an equality
[2123.46 --> 2130.74]  among all the guests they're saying i'm better than you and we all should know that
[2133.46 --> 2138.82]  okay so we probably don't feel like we do that very often but like if you're like me then you know
[2138.82 --> 2143.38]  those voices in your head that get a little jealous of someone else's success
[2143.38 --> 2151.46]  that gets a little annoyed when someone else is having a better luck than we are
[2153.70 --> 2159.46]  that just like can't stand that one person whose name keeps coming up in all the conversations
[2159.46 --> 2172.90]  but when we remember that we are all the guests of jesus when we remember his great love for us
[2172.90 --> 2182.02]  when we center our attention back on god and all that god has done for us
[2182.02 --> 2188.18]  when we rest not in our own accomplishments
[2190.82 --> 2196.98]  but in the work of our savior it doesn't matter where we sit does it
[2196.98 --> 2207.70]  because we're all there and in fact there's even more joy knowing that other people know this love
[2207.70 --> 2215.06]  and this grace the way that you do you're glad to see people gathered together
[2216.66 --> 2223.70]  and this is what jesus is describing when he says go sit in the lowest seat it's literally to go
[2224.34 --> 2231.38]  to the furthest boundary of the area in question like that's literally the verb that or the word that
[2231.38 --> 2240.42]  jesus is using there the lowest place is the furthest boundary jesus who takes people from the edges
[2241.62 --> 2249.54]  and with his love sits them at the center isn't that the work of god to gather his people
[2249.54 --> 2257.14]  to bring diverse people who would never choose to be in community together together
[2258.02 --> 2263.78]  for the purposes of showing his love and goodness in the world
[2265.86 --> 2271.54]  for the purpose of helping us to see that together as the body of christ we are all valuable
[2272.50 --> 2279.46]  we all have a place of belonging with one another because christ is the one who has pulled us together
[2279.54 --> 2282.10]  and christ is the head of the church
[2285.94 --> 2294.42]  the wisdom of god to celebrate and support that diversity and that bringing people from the edges
[2294.42 --> 2303.78]  to the very center to know that as the guests of god we are all loved and valued and important in his kingdom
[2303.78 --> 2313.30]  because the truth of the matter is we are all the guests of god but god has also made us his agents
[2313.30 --> 2325.46]  of reconciliation of renewal of peace god recognizes that we have power to invite others even as his guests
[2325.46 --> 2334.18]  this is his design we have the power in the way that we live our lives to honor one another we have power in
[2334.18 --> 2342.02]  the way that we live our lives to bear the fruit of the spirit in such a way that those on the edges feel like they're at the center
[2344.50 --> 2348.90]  we have power in the way that we live and step with the holy spirit
[2348.90 --> 2359.30]  the spirit that embodies the wisdom of jesus christ that embodies the truths and the values of the kingdom
[2360.82 --> 2368.42]  that lives as though this world is an invitation to celebrate the goodness of god in every way imaginable
[2368.98 --> 2370.10]  as long as it's righteous
[2370.10 --> 2379.54]  that in this invitation to be guests there is so much freedom to explore but it will require deep
[2380.10 --> 2387.54]  trust it will require the presence of god himself in us because otherwise we are going to fall into those
[2387.54 --> 2396.82]  temptations of control power we are going to fall into the worries about needing to prove our place and
[2396.82 --> 2403.38]  our worth and our value we're going to fall into the trap of needing to feel important to everyone else
[2404.90 --> 2412.10]  and forget that we are already important enough to jesus christ that he came and he died for us
[2413.14 --> 2420.82]  he came and he died for me he came and he died for you we're already important enough that god the creator
[2420.82 --> 2431.78]  of this massive incomprehensible universe knows the hair on your head we already matter and are important
[2431.78 --> 2440.34]  enough that the holy spirit is still god with us transforming our hearts of stone into hearts of flesh and enabling us to live
[2440.90 --> 2450.74]  as jesus lived what more do we need to trust that the generosity that we show to one
[2450.74 --> 2465.94]  another without thought of ourself will be returned to us manifold and is already being returned to us by the graciousness of god our father
[2468.10 --> 2477.14]  that that at the resurrection of the righteous everyone who lives in the way of christ will feel like they are sitting next to jesus
[2477.14 --> 2481.30]  for eternity isn't that something
[2484.02 --> 2494.82]  our amazing god can do that for each of us we can't imagine it and yet that is the truth that we must hold on to
[2495.78 --> 2503.86]  that is the truth we must trust so that we will be generous as hosts generous as we look around
[2503.86 --> 2511.22]  not only in the sanctuary but out into our community generous as we think about ourselves
[2512.90 --> 2522.82]  and our place in the world what we're worthy of what we can contribute when we start to wonder how might we
[2522.82 --> 2530.58]  live into the fullness of this wedding banquet even
[2532.02 --> 2534.58]  wisdom begins with wonder
[2538.50 --> 2542.18]  and if we follow the way of jesus sometimes a little awkwardness
[2542.18 --> 2552.42]  jesus tells this story he's just done a healing in their midst and he's asked a couple of questions
[2552.42 --> 2557.94]  that have gotten silent responses because the people know that they're getting caught
[2559.14 --> 2565.38]  even though they've been watching jesus closely jesus asks questions and wonders with them in ways that
[2565.38 --> 2569.30]  will open up their experience of the truth that he's trying to share with them
[2573.22 --> 2578.02]  so as we close i'm going to give you a few questions that you could wonder about
[2579.62 --> 2587.46]  that come from the way that jesus tells the story what if we lived our lives
[2587.46 --> 2594.18]  what if we lived our lives we worked and we played contributed and thought
[2596.82 --> 2603.22]  like the guests that we are what if we lived our lives like the guests that we are
[2605.70 --> 2613.70]  what if we lived free from having to prove our worth or feeling like we had to prove our worth
[2613.70 --> 2618.82]  or force our grandeur or belonging
[2621.62 --> 2632.50]  what if our lives our work our relationships expanded the boundaries and represented the diversity of god's kingdom values
[2632.50 --> 2649.30]  what if what god has given us we've turned to others generously with what if we took our times our talents and our treasures
[2650.66 --> 2659.94]  as gifts that have been given to us to be shared not just for our own advancement but for the good of the world
[2659.94 --> 2665.38]  not just for somebody who might be able to return the favor
[2667.38 --> 2671.70]  but for those whom we never know if they might do anything for us
[2675.22 --> 2687.06]  and what if we truly trusted that christ and the spirit are our living waters alive in us
[2687.06 --> 2694.10]  the fount of every good and beautiful thing we do in this life
[2696.18 --> 2707.70]  our righteousness becoming more and more in the image of the righteousness of the perfect savior jesus christ
[2707.70 --> 2718.82]  what if we lived like this world was a celebratory party of god's love for it
[2721.06 --> 2727.46]  and you were invited to tell everyone else that they're invited to
[2727.46 --> 2731.30]  let's pray
[2738.10 --> 2742.50]  we pray for this trust necessary to be generous
[2746.34 --> 2750.90]  we pray for the confidence of knowing that we belong to you
[2750.90 --> 2760.02]  we thank you jesus for the ways in which you through your spirit
[2762.26 --> 2770.58]  reinforce remind us of the fact that we are your guest and you will make sure that we have what we need
[2770.58 --> 2777.14]  we thank you god our father for creating with such diversity
[2779.46 --> 2788.02]  that we might experience more and more of this wonderful world that you have made by supporting and encouraging one another
[2788.02 --> 2792.82]  to explore and adventure with the gifts and the skills and the lives that you've given us
[2792.82 --> 2801.30]  so holy spirit we pray that as you speak to us throughout our ordinary everyday lives
[2802.26 --> 2805.38]  we will sense opportunities to be generous
[2809.54 --> 2813.54]  to share and support and gather people together who are in need
[2813.54 --> 2823.86]  you will guide us holy spirit in the times when we are the one who is in need and needs to accept
[2824.50 --> 2831.30]  the love and support of those around us and help us to see how all of these things are the ways in which we share
[2831.30 --> 2836.18]  your love the ways in which we witness to your wedding feast that is to come
[2836.18 --> 2844.18]  we thank you jesus that we have your righteousness to be clothed in that makes us welcome at that feast
[2844.18 --> 2850.98]  and so we pray as we live towards that future that beautiful future that is to come more and more of it will
[2850.98 --> 2861.62]  become alive in us even now even today speak lord as we go for we your servants and your guests are listening
[2861.62 --> 2874.42]  in jesus name we pray amen amen amen thank you pastor chelston and we'll continue her prayer she said near
[2874.42 --> 2882.42]  the end speak oh lord and verse two of the song we're about to sing uh is a very clear response or
[2882.42 --> 2888.98]  appropriate response to what we've heard today teach us lord full obedience holy reverence true humility

[2942.50 --> 2944.50]  take your truth
[2944.50 --> 2954.26]  take your truth
[2954.26 --> 2956.26]  take your truth
[2956.26 --> 2958.26]  take your truth
[2958.26 --> 2968.02]  take your truth

[3058.10 --> 3064.10]  help us
[3064.10 --> 3070.56]  That will end for now to eternity
[3070.56 --> 3077.46]  And my grace will stand on your promises
[3077.46 --> 3085.72]  And my faith will walk as you walk with us
[3085.72 --> 3092.04]  Speak, O Lord, till your church is built
[3092.04 --> 3098.70]  And the earth is filled with your glory
[3098.70 --> 3113.54]  At this point I'd like to invite the deacons up
[3113.54 --> 3116.80]  to take our morning's offering, which is for the Talking Bible.
[3117.56 --> 3119.78]  This is a ministry through the banner
[3119.78 --> 3121.82]  which makes audio versions of the Bible available.
[3122.04 --> 3123.82]  In over 2,000 languages
[3123.82 --> 3127.66]  for the over 700 million people in the world who cannot read
[3127.66 --> 3130.48]  and also for those who don't have access to a written Bible.
[3131.02 --> 3132.46]  So please give as you are able.
[3152.04 --> 3152.82]  Amen.
[3152.82 --> 3153.30]  Amen.
[3157.92 --> 3158.18]  Amen.
[3158.18 --> 3160.18]  Amen.
[3188.18 --> 3190.18]  Amen.
[3218.18 --> 3220.18]  Amen.
[3248.18 --> 3250.18]  Amen.
[3278.18 --> 3280.18]  Amen.
[3308.18 --> 3310.18]  Amen.
[3338.18 --> 3340.18]  Amen.
[3368.18 --> 3369.18]  Amen.
[3369.18 --> 3370.18]  Amen.
[3370.18 --> 3372.18]  Amen.
[3372.18 --> 3374.18]  Amen.
[3385.18 --> 3387.18]  Amen.
[3393.18 --> 3397.18]  This morning, we'll be lifting up Quinn in our prayers.
[3397.18 --> 3401.98]  Quinn is the son-in-law of Terry and Laurie and he, if you saw in the bulletin this morning,
[3402.06 --> 3406.48]  he's been involved in a rather serious aviation accident. It sounds like he's in stable condition,
[3406.56 --> 3412.36]  what I've heard this morning, but yeah, in a lot of pain, of course, as many broken bones and so
[3412.36 --> 3421.42]  forth. So let's come to God in our time of prayer. Almighty God, we come to worship you this morning
[3421.42 --> 3426.22]  at the end of the summer and the start of a new year for students and teachers and the start of
[3426.22 --> 3431.70]  harvest season for our farmers. The cooler, wetter weather is about to begin and we thank you for a
[3431.70 --> 3436.24]  warm and pleasant summer here in BC, free from wildfires that have been so prevalent all these
[3436.24 --> 3441.46]  years. We pray for the parts of the world that have not been spared natural disasters. We think of
[3441.46 --> 3446.34]  Europe and their record-breaking heat and drought, but we especially think this week of the flood
[3446.34 --> 3451.18]  victims in Pakistan, where over a thousand people have died and millions have lost their livelihood.
[3452.00 --> 3456.00]  Already living in a country ruled by a corrupt and ineffective government and surrounded by
[3456.00 --> 3462.34]  widespread poverty, this disaster seems especially cruel. We pray too for the ongoing warfare and
[3462.34 --> 3467.34]  bloodshed not only in Ukraine, but also many countries in Africa and the Middle East. The
[3467.34 --> 3473.68]  ongoing violence in places like Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia are totally forgotten
[3473.68 --> 3479.42]  and ignored by Western media, despite the thousands of deaths and millions displaced. But you, oh Lord,
[3479.42 --> 3485.10]  do not forget and do not ignore. You know their suffering and you hear their bitter cries of
[3485.10 --> 3491.54]  anguish. We ask you, Lord, for mercy and comfort and for you to turn the hearts of those who
[3491.54 --> 3497.78]  perpetrate the violence, especially those who do it for their own personal gain. Help us to not take
[3497.78 --> 3502.04]  for granted that here in Canada we are blessed with a stable government that by all accounts works for
[3502.04 --> 3507.14]  the betterment and safety of their people. We worship you openly this morning, never for a moment
[3507.14 --> 3513.14]  needing to worry about guns or bombs or rockets. But despite our many blessings, Lord, this congregation
[3513.14 --> 3521.22]  still carries very real and painful burdens. We pray for healing for Quinn and for Rick's grandson, Richie.
[3521.22 --> 3528.10]  Be near to Joyce, Jim and Anita and the rest of the family as they grieve the loss of their daughter and
[3528.10 --> 3538.58]  sister-in-law Ingrid. Grant them comfort in their loss. We ask to be near to our sick and shut-in. We think of Pat,
[3539.38 --> 3555.46]  Ellie, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Mark, Jerry and Anne, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, John, Henry, and for any others who I may have missed.
[3555.46 --> 3581.86]  For those who suffer the endless battle against lifelong illness. For those struggling against daily pain and chronic health issues. For those suffering with mental illness, depression, addiction, with loneliness. For those who are grieving the loss of a loved one recently or a long time ago. For those among us who are facing the daily effects of old age. Be near to us, Lord.
[3581.86 --> 3593.86]  We pray for a new heaven and a new earth. And for a day when you will wipe every tear from our eyes. A day when there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain.
[3593.86 --> 3611.38]  We pray for our church here in Ladner. Guide our work through your Holy Spirit. Thank you for this family of believers here. Compassionate, thoughtful people who look to do good in the world and are proud to do so in your name and your name alone.
[3611.38 --> 3618.34]  We come before you this morning to worship you, to praise you, to sing your name, and to give thanks for all you have done.
[3619.46 --> 3631.98]  Lord, give us everything we stand in need of and guard us against everything we don't. May your kingdom come and your will be done, not ours. In Jesus' powerful name. Amen.
[3631.98 --> 3638.26]  Amen. At this point, I'd like to invite Pastor Chelsea back up to bring us God's parting blessing.
[3644.80 --> 3652.10]  One of the things that happens when you're a guest is that you grow in a sense of gratitude for what you experience when you go to different places.
[3652.66 --> 3659.78]  And so thank you for welcoming me this morning. Thank you as well for helping me remember the diversity of worship.
