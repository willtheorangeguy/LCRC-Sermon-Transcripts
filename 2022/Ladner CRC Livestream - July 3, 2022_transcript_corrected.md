[300.00 → 327.54] Good morning.
[327.54 → 327.56] Good morning.
[327.56 → 328.56] Good morning.
[328.56 → 333.72] Welcome to worship here today at Ladder Christian Reformed Church on this rainy day.
[333.72 → 338.18] It's great to be gathered together with God's people this morning.
[338.18 → 339.18] My name is Jason True.
[339.18 → 342.18] I'll be leading us in worship this morning.
[342.18 → 346.12] So just a few announcements before we begin.
[346.12 → 353.18] First is that we have some welcome cards that are in the slot in front of you in the pew.
[353.18 → 357.34] And so if you are new, we'd love to welcome you to get to know you.
[357.34 → 362.80] And so we invite you to fill out a welcome card, and we can be in touch with you later.
[362.80 → 369.14] Also, next week, the second Sunday of the month is our usual Lord's Supper celebration.
[369.14 → 372.18] But for July and August, we're actually moving it.
[372.18 → 375.42] So the next Lord's Supper will be July 17.
[375.42 → 376.04] Okay.
[376.04 → 377.04] So just make a note of that.
[377.04 → 379.18] July 17, not next week, but the week after.
[379.18 → 386.46] Also, beginning now here in the summer, we will be having only one combined Sunday school
[386.46 → 387.04] class.
[387.04 → 392.36] So starting this Sunday, it's for children age three through grade four.
[392.36 → 398.02] So children in that age range are welcome to attend, but children are also welcome to stay
[398.02 → 400.12] here for the whole worship service.
[401.74 → 406.68] Lastly, well, second to last, you know, we're having a summer camp or basic skills camp in
[406.68 → 407.06] August.
[407.32 → 413.84] We still have a few spots that we would really need some more help to serve.
[414.14 → 417.16] So we have the signup sheets on the table there.
[417.76 → 419.06] I'll be there after the service.
[419.06 → 423.66] I can answer any questions you have about, you know, maybe how you can best use your time
[423.66 → 425.90] and abilities to help put on this camp.
[426.32 → 427.08] So we're very excited.
[427.22 → 428.44] We have a lot of kids signed up.
[428.92 → 432.24] And so we're looking forward to welcoming them and serving them this summer.
[433.36 → 438.82] Then also today, I want to introduce to you and welcome to us Paul Kemp.
[439.50 → 444.76] So Paul, today is his first official day as our new worship coordinator.
[445.58 → 446.32] So, yes.
[446.32 → 452.90] So I asked Paul if he would come up and just briefly introduce himself.
[454.68 → 455.24] Hi.
[455.76 → 457.54] Thank you.
[457.74 → 458.24] Thank you.
[458.76 → 465.96] My name is Paul, as has been mentioned, and I've had the privilege of being connected periodically
[465.96 → 474.72] with your worship and your ministry here at Ladder back from my days with Ernst.
[475.08 → 480.04] I was working with Ernst probably 25 years ago at the Greenhouse and got to know him there
[480.04 → 481.74] and as a Christian brother.
[481.98 → 489.22] And then he probably had me come play maybe as long ago as 15 years ago for a certain thing.
[489.22 → 498.78] And then over the last few years, a couple of times, or about every couple months, I was invited
[498.78 → 499.78] to come and play.
[499.88 → 502.98] And I've really enjoyed being part of your worship.
[502.98 → 509.60] It's just great to be in a place where you play a note and, boy, people sing and engage.
[509.74 → 517.90] And that's great when you're up front just to have that response and the joy that's ready
[517.90 → 519.70] to come out in your singing.
[519.70 → 529.76] So I grew up in Ontario and came out here to do a church music degree in 1981 and met my
[529.76 → 530.40] wife, Terri.
[530.58 → 533.30] So, yeah, there's Terri over there.
[533.68 → 535.76] And we stayed.
[535.92 → 536.96] She's from Calgary.
[537.12 → 543.66] And we stayed after our college days and were in Richmond and then to Austin for the last
[543.66 → 552.54] 32 years and involved with South Delta Baptist and helping out other places in music and ministry.
[553.34 → 562.62] So just really pleased to help out with coordinating with what you do here and with the great people
[562.62 → 564.86] I've met already.
[565.22 → 569.10] And it's just really exciting for me to be able to assist.
[569.10 → 575.98] And there's so much that's going so well in the area of worship that I'm just excited
[575.98 → 582.64] to do what I can to help bring some assistance and direction, work with Jason and your team
[582.64 → 582.90] here.
[583.40 → 586.24] I teach piano during the school year.
[586.34 → 588.32] That's kind of my main job.
[588.48 → 591.04] I've just finished my 38th year of doing that.
[591.60 → 596.82] But this is also a passion of mine, being involved in worship.
[596.82 → 598.16] Thank you.
[599.10 → 607.12] So we are very excited to have Paul with us.
[607.64 → 614.40] And so with that, and with that suggestion that Paul gave of our great singing, as a congregation,
[614.62 → 615.46] would you please rise?
[616.00 → 618.06] And we'll sing our first song together.
[618.06 → 645.94] Oh, your Lord, your glorious name.
[645.94 → 650.02] All your wondrous words proclaim.
[650.02 → 654.36] In the heavens with radiant signs.
[654.48 → 658.24] Evermore your glory shines.
[658.52 → 662.40] How great your name.
[662.40 → 664.40] Lord, our Lord, your glory shines.
[664.40 → 666.96] Lord, our Lord, in all the earth.
[666.96 → 670.74] How great your name.
[670.94 → 675.18] Yours the name of matchless worth.
[675.18 → 679.12] And so lift in all the earth.
[679.42 → 683.04] How great your name.
[683.04 → 685.04] How great your name.
[685.04 → 689.28] Who are we that we should share.
[689.28 → 693.56] In your love and tender care.
[693.56 → 697.90] Raise to an excellent height.
[697.90 → 699.90] Crown with honour in your sight.
[699.90 → 702.12] Crown with honour in your sight.
[702.12 → 706.52] How great your name.
[706.52 → 711.28] Lord, our Lord, our Lord, in all the earth.
[711.28 → 715.34] How great your name.
[715.34 → 719.82] Yours the name of matchless worth.
[719.82 → 723.70] Excellent in all the earth.
[723.70 → 728.24] How great your name.
[729.98 → 734.00] With dominion crowned we stand.
[734.30 → 738.24] O'er the creatures of your hand.
[738.24 → 743.24] All to a subjection crowned we stand.
[743.24 → 746.48] In the sea and air and field.
[746.48 → 750.70] How great your name.
[750.70 → 750.72] How great your name.
[750.72 → 755.30] Lord, our Lord, in all the earth.
[755.30 → 759.56] How great your name.
[759.56 → 763.92] Yours the name of matchless worth.
[764.30 → 767.90] Excellent in all the earth.
[767.90 → 773.02] How great your name.
[779.02 → 779.90] You may be seated.
[783.50 → 786.04] So the Lord calls us to worship this morning.
[787.24 → 789.40] And our call to worship is from Psalm 105.
[790.18 → 792.80] And where it's bolded, it has the double arrow.
[792.98 → 795.76] I invite you to read it aloud with me.
[795.98 → 796.54] Psalm 105.
[796.54 → 799.16] Give praise to the Lord.
[799.16 → 799.66] Psalm 105.
[799.66 → 801.16] Proclaim his name.
[801.16 → 805.36] Make known among the nations what he has done.
[805.36 → 807.36] Sing to him.
[807.36 → 809.36] Sing praise to him.
[809.36 → 812.92] Tell of all of his wondrous acts.
[812.92 → 815.42] Glory in his holy name.
[815.42 → 818.66] Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
[818.66 → 821.66] Look to the Lord and his strength.
[821.66 → 822.28] His strength.
[822.28 → 824.28] Seek his face always.
[824.28 → 827.28] Remember the wonders he has done.
[827.28 → 830.48] His miracles and the judgments he pronounced.
[830.48 → 832.48] You his servants.
[832.48 → 834.48] The descendants of Abraham.
[834.48 → 836.78] His chosen ones.
[836.78 → 838.78] The children of Jacob.
[838.78 → 842.74] He is the Lord our God.
[843.40 → 846.30] His judgments are in all the earth.
[846.60 → 847.90] Praise the Lord.
[848.28 → 850.28] Please join me in a prayer of adoration.
[850.28 → 854.84] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[854.90 → 859.10] God of your church here at Lander CRC.
[859.10 → 864.86] We praise you for all you have done on this good earth that you have made.
[864.86 → 867.98] We rejoice in your wonderful works.
[867.98 → 871.26] The wonders you have done.
[872.14 → 875.62] We thank you for eyes to see your wonders and to experience it.
[876.20 → 878.92] And for lips to tell and to sing of it.
[879.78 → 883.74] We thank you that you have gathered your family here as one this morning.
[884.46 → 893.04] Would you receive this offering of our worship, O Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, both now and forever.
[893.74 → 894.08] Amen.
[895.42 → 899.70] Please rise in body or in spirit for God's greeting from Psalm 33.
[899.70 → 905.76] It says, our heart is glad in him because we trust in his holy name.
[906.46 → 912.02] Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in you.
[913.40 → 915.38] So we put our hope in the Lord this morning.
[916.00 → 921.46] And now that God has called us and has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet and welcome one another in the name of the Lord.
[924.86 → 927.70] And he gave his beautiful safe.
[927.70 → 928.10] Amen.
[928.12 → 929.40] God bless you.
[929.66 → 929.84] Amen.
[929.84 → 930.04] Amen.
[930.48 → 931.12] Hallelujah.
[931.20 → 931.48] Amen.
[931.48 → 931.70] men.
[931.70 → 931.82] Amen.
[932.62 → 933.34] Thank you.
[933.50 → 933.52] Amen.
[933.52 → 963.50] Thank you.
[963.52 → 988.62] I love to tell the story of unseen things above, of Jesus and his glory, of Jesus and his love.
[988.62 → 997.60] I love to tell the story because I know it is true.
[998.14 → 1006.38] It satisfies my longing as nothing else can do.
[1006.38 → 1026.16] I love to tell the story, it will be my theme in glory, to tell the old, old story of Jesus and his love.
[1026.16 → 1036.16] I love to tell the story, it is pleasant to repeat.
[1036.54 → 1045.08] What seems each time I tell it more wonderfully sweet.
[1045.08 → 1075.08] 
[1075.08 → 1084.08] To tell the old, old story of Jesus and his love.
[1084.08 → 1095.56] I love to tell the story for those who know it best.
[1095.56 → 1104.56] Sing, hungry and thirsty, to hear it like the rest.
[1104.56 → 1114.78] And when it seems a glory, I sing the new, new song.
[1114.78 → 1121.78] It will be my love, it will be my love.
[1121.78 → 1143.78] I love to tell the story, it will be my theme in glory, to tell the old, old story of Jesus and his love.
[1143.78 → 1145.78] I love to tell the story, it will be my love.
[1145.78 → 1150.78] I love to tell the story, it will be my love.
[1150.78 → 1180.76] Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One.
[1180.78 → 1185.78] Be still for the presence of the Lord.
[1185.78 → 1194.78] Come now before him now, with reverence and fear.
[1194.78 → 1205.78] In him no sin is found, we stand on holy ground.
[1205.78 → 1210.78] Be still for the presence of the Lord.
[1210.78 → 1216.78] Be still for the presence of the Lord, the Holy One is here.
[1216.78 → 1227.78] Be still for the glory of the Lord, he's shining all around.
[1227.78 → 1239.78] He burns with holy fire, with splendour he is crowned.
[1239.78 → 1249.78] How awesome is the sight, our radiant King of light.
[1249.78 → 1262.78] Be still for the glory of the Lord, he's shining all around.
[1262.78 → 1265.78] Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is here.
[1265.78 → 1272.78] Be still for the glory of the Lord, the Holy One is living in this place.
[1272.78 → 1283.78] He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister His grace.
[1283.78 → 1294.70] No work too hard for Him, if faith be seen from Him.
[1294.70 → 1304.20] Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place.
[1313.78 → 1321.64] So we come now to this time of confession.
[1321.64 → 1328.54] The reason why we do this strange thing every week, every single week, called the confession
[1328.54 → 1332.96] of sin, is because of what we just sang about.
[1332.96 → 1340.34] We sang, He burns with holy fire, with splendour He is crowned.
[1340.34 → 1345.22] How awesome is the sight, our radiant King of light.
[1345.22 → 1350.96] We worship God for who He is, holy, awesome, radiant.
[1350.96 → 1358.80] And God made us, and He made people in His image to reflect His radiance out into the world.
[1358.80 → 1365.78] And yet because of sin, you and I are broken people living in a broken world who keep breaking
[1365.78 → 1368.16] stuff.
[1368.16 → 1374.56] And so we come before the Lord and we plea the mercy of Jesus, who gives us standing
[1374.56 → 1382.20] before this holy God because we are clothed with His righteousness through faith in Him.
[1382.20 → 1384.84] So that's why we confess our sins together.
[1384.84 → 1390.58] Not to remember our badness, but to lay hold of the mercy of Jesus.
[1390.58 → 1394.36] So let's confess that we need that mercy together right now.
[1394.36 → 1396.20] Let's say this prayer together.
[1396.20 → 1400.76] It's a prayer of Ambrose of Milan, who lived in the fourth century, who was kind of the
[1400.76 → 1402.76] mentor, the spiritual father of St. Augustine.
[1402.76 → 1406.00] So let's say this prayer together.
[1406.00 → 1416.16] Oh Lord, who has mercy upon all, take away from me my sins and mercifully kindle in me the fire
[1416.16 → 1417.76] of your Holy Spirit.
[1417.76 → 1433.00] Take away from me the heart of stone and give me the heart of flesh, a heart to love and adore you, a heart to delight in you, to follow and enjoy you.
[1433.44 → 1434.76] For Christ's sake.
[1435.32 → 1435.78] Amen.
[1435.78 → 1441.46] Take a moment to acknowledge before the Lord Jesus Christ your need for His mercy.
[1441.46 → 1442.28] Amen.
[1442.28 → 1443.46] Amen.
[1443.46 → 1444.36] Amen.
[1444.36 → 1445.46] Amen.
[1445.46 → 1446.24] Amen.
[1446.24 → 1448.30] Amen.
[1448.30 → 1448.40] Amen.
[1448.40 → 1449.16] Amen.
[1449.16 → 1450.10] Amen.
[1450.10 → 1450.20] Amen.
[1450.20 → 1450.30] Amen.
[1450.30 → 1452.22] Amen.
[1452.22 → 1462.22] Amen.
[1462.22 → 1462.26] Amen.
[1462.26 → 1462.32] Amen.
[1462.32 → 1462.38] Amen.
[1462.38 → 1462.80] Amen.
[1462.80 → 1463.86] Amen.
[1463.86 → 1463.98] Amen.
[1463.98 → 1464.28] Amen.
[1464.28 → 1465.36] Amen.
[1465.36 → 1472.98] these amazing words of comfort and promise from Ezekiel 36. I will sprinkle clean water on you
[1472.98 → 1479.72] and you shall be clean from all your uncleanliness and from all of your idols I will cleanse you
[1479.72 → 1488.40] and I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I will remove the heart
[1488.40 → 1494.46] of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you
[1494.46 → 1504.26] and cause you to walk in my statues and be careful to obey my rules bless the Lord who forgives all our
[1504.26 → 1511.64] sins his mercy endures forever let's sing of that mercy together in the song of renewal
[1511.64 → 1535.10] there's a kindness in God's mercy like the widest of the sea there's a kindness in God's justice
[1535.10 → 1547.10] which is more than liberty there is no place for earth's sorrows are fulfilled and up in heaven
[1547.10 → 1555.90] there is no place for earth's failings have such kindly judgment given
[1555.90 → 1577.90] for the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind and the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind
[1577.90 → 1595.90] make our love of God more faithful let us take you and your word and our lives will be thanksgiving for the goodness of the Lord
[1595.90 → 1615.90] I did forget to dismiss the kids, so Sunday school is about to start and let's prepare our hearts and our ears to hear God's word together
[1615.90 → 1645.80] I'll be reading from Ephesians 2 the verses 4 through 10 but because of his great love for us God who is rich in mercy made us alive with
[1645.80 → 1672.80] Christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus
[1672.80 → 1700.80] for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of God not by works so that no one can boast of we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do this is the word of the Lord
[1700.80 → 1702.80] thanks be to God
[1702.80 → 1728.56] so we are in a sermon series through the book of Ephesians and this is already a couple of weeks in, and we are in chapter 2, but before we get it continue and get into our text today let's turn to the Lord and pray
[1728.56 → 1744.54] please join me in prayer our father before we step into a study of your word this morning we ask that you would guide us through it by your Holy Spirit I pray that you would remove any sinful thoughts any distractions
[1744.54 → 1747.54] Lord push all of us to do that aside
[1747.54 → 1759.58] help us to pay attention to your word to what you would say to us this morning so that we might live by your will and not our own we pray this for your glory in Jesus name Amen
[1759.58 → 1773.58] Christians who believe the same gospel have wildly different experiences right Christians who believe the same gospel story
[1773.58 → 1790.70] have wildly different experiences some of us were born Jews in the first century we saw the miracles of Jesus we saw our religious authorities condemn him to death
[1790.70 → 1801.36] but then we heard about his resurrection from the dead, and we were in Jerusalem on that Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came as promised
[1801.36 → 1805.68] we heard each other speaking in languages we did not know
[1805.68 → 1810.36] and then Peter preached the sermon and lots of people joined us
[1810.36 → 1816.22] that is a very Christian experience, but that is not our experience
[1816.22 → 1826.60] now some of us Christians around the world we were born in 9th century France 9th century France
[1826.60 → 1830.28] we were baptized as a child into the village church
[1830.28 → 1844.06] we said the Apostles Creed together, and we believed it and in our whole life we never met anyone in our village who claimed not to be a Christian
[1844.06 → 1850.26] that is a very Christian experience, but that is not our experience
[1850.26 → 1855.14] some of us were born in 19th century China
[1855.14 → 1861.78] 19th century China we were raised to believe in Buddha and worshipped at the village temple
[1861.78 → 1865.80] but then foreign people came and told us about the story of Jesus
[1865.80 → 1868.40] the son of the one true God
[1868.40 → 1871.96] they brought the Bible and we believed it
[1871.96 → 1877.90] but becoming a Christian caused terrible divisions in our family and in our village
[1877.90 → 1881.32] that is a very Christian experience
[1881.32 → 1883.88] but that is not our experience
[1883.88 → 1885.98] and so what of today?
[1887.12 → 1889.12] well Christians who believe the same story
[1889.12 → 1892.26] still have wildly different experiences
[1892.26 → 1894.10] you know some of us come from families
[1894.10 → 1897.42] that made it very easy to believe the gospel
[1897.42 → 1900.46] in fact we don't remember ever not believing it
[1900.46 → 1902.42] we grew up going to church
[1902.42 → 1905.20] in Sunday school, youth group, and church camp
[1905.20 → 1907.22] we still serve in church
[1907.22 → 1908.68] we worship faithfully
[1908.68 → 1912.24] others of us come from backgrounds
[1912.24 → 1915.06] where it was not at all easy to believe the Bible
[1915.06 → 1917.18] maybe our parents were atheists
[1917.18 → 1919.32] and we were suspicious of those religious people
[1919.32 → 1923.06] but later a friend shared the gospel with us
[1923.06 → 1924.80] and we believed it
[1924.80 → 1927.68] it was as much a surprise to us as anybody
[1927.68 → 1931.00] but Jesus radically changed our lives
[1931.00 → 1934.34] see Christians who believe the same story
[1934.34 → 1936.38] have wildly different experiences
[1936.38 → 1939.56] but here's the question for us to consider this morning
[1939.56 → 1943.04] is there any experience that we all share?
[1943.88 → 1946.98] no matter how we came to believe the gospel story
[1946.98 → 1951.06] is there any experience that Christians share?
[1951.94 → 1953.98] where whatever story we tell
[1953.98 → 1956.38] that there is something that we recognize
[1956.38 → 1959.52] in one another as fellow believers
[1959.52 → 1961.30] united in Christ together
[1961.30 → 1965.32] and this is where we come to our passage in Ephesians this morning
[1965.32 → 1968.38] this is a letter in the New Testament
[1968.38 → 1970.02] it's written by the Apostle Paul
[1970.02 → 1970.82] who was a Jew
[1970.82 → 1973.48] who after his encounter with Jesus
[1973.48 → 1975.28] and then his conversion to Jesus
[1975.28 → 1978.28] became a missionary to the Gentiles
[1978.28 → 1980.54] who were his cultural enemies
[1980.54 → 1983.14] and he wrote to a church
[1983.14 → 1984.50] in Ephesus
[1984.50 → 1988.46] that had both Jews and Gentiles in it
[1988.46 → 1992.20] who were struggling to learn how to live together as the church
[1992.20 → 1995.02] and so Paul wrote this letter to help them
[1995.02 → 1997.76] and he's doing that in this passage
[1997.76 → 1999.62] he's trying to help them learn to live together
[1999.62 → 2002.80] and he's doing it here by helping them to see
[2002.80 → 2007.32] that they share a common experience of God's grace
[2007.32 → 2011.86] this experience is found in first century Jerusalem
[2011.86 → 2014.28] and in ninth century France
[2014.28 → 2015.90] and in 19th century China
[2015.90 → 2017.04] and today
[2017.04 → 2020.88] and it's found in verses 8 and 9
[2020.88 → 2024.30] which are some of the best verses known in the entire Bible
[2024.30 → 2026.26] it says
[2026.26 → 2027.92] for it is by grace
[2027.92 → 2029.42] you have been saved
[2029.42 → 2030.60] through faith
[2030.60 → 2032.78] and this is not from yourselves
[2032.78 → 2034.14] it is the gift of God
[2034.14 → 2035.74] not by works
[2035.74 → 2037.68] so that no one can boast
[2037.68 → 2040.06] and so today's message
[2040.06 → 2041.06] from God's word
[2041.06 → 2041.96] to us
[2041.96 → 2043.82] is all about grace
[2043.82 → 2045.50] it's all about grace
[2045.50 → 2047.26] and this text tells us three things
[2047.26 → 2050.80] first that grace is the fountain of salvation
[2050.80 → 2053.44] imagine a fountain that's just bubbling forth
[2053.44 → 2054.36] it's overflowing
[2054.36 → 2056.18] God's grace just keeps coming
[2056.18 → 2059.26] but secondly there's a conduit
[2059.26 → 2062.86] that gets grace from God to us
[2062.86 → 2064.60] and that's called faith
[2064.60 → 2067.70] grace doesn't just kind of splash out of the fountain
[2067.70 → 2068.46] into nowhere
[2068.46 → 2071.26] God has a purpose for his grace
[2071.26 → 2074.04] it's channelled through a pipe to us
[2074.04 → 2075.74] and that's faith
[2075.74 → 2076.92] that's the second thing
[2076.92 → 2078.58] and the third thing
[2078.58 → 2079.76] is that God tells us
[2079.76 → 2082.04] that our salvation is not by works
[2082.04 → 2084.34] and that means that there is nothing
[2084.34 → 2085.80] nothing
[2085.80 → 2086.92] nothing
[2086.92 → 2088.94] that you could do
[2088.94 → 2089.66] think
[2089.66 → 2090.90] or say
[2090.90 → 2093.02] that enables you to look good
[2093.02 → 2093.82] to God
[2093.82 → 2096.68] so first
[2096.68 → 2098.06] and this is the passage
[2098.06 → 2099.16] we're going to focus on this morning
[2099.16 → 2100.64] first we are saved by grace
[2100.64 → 2103.56] now to understand
[2103.56 → 2105.40] God's grace and mercy towards us
[2105.40 → 2106.82] there's this really great story
[2106.82 → 2109.98] that is somewhat well known
[2109.98 → 2111.16] preachers often use
[2111.16 → 2112.80] it comes from a man
[2112.80 → 2115.08] by the name of Henry Morehouse
[2115.08 → 2118.74] Morehouse was a social worker
[2118.74 → 2121.98] in London, England
[2121.98 → 2125.32] and he lived in the very worst of slums
[2125.32 → 2127.68] in London in the 1800s
[2127.68 → 2130.44] so he was walking down the street
[2130.44 → 2131.00] one day
[2131.00 → 2132.28] at the end of his work day
[2132.28 → 2133.16] and he was heading home
[2133.16 → 2135.74] and he saw just down the sidewalk
[2135.74 → 2136.54] a little girl
[2136.54 → 2137.64] come out of a shop
[2137.64 → 2139.20] with a pottery pitcher
[2139.20 → 2139.96] in her hand
[2139.96 → 2141.14] that was full of milk
[2141.14 → 2143.78] and then she started coming towards him
[2143.78 → 2144.80] down the sidewalk
[2144.80 → 2148.18] and not too far from him
[2148.18 → 2149.70] she slipped
[2149.70 → 2152.34] and as we would all naturally do
[2152.34 → 2153.84] she lost her grip
[2153.84 → 2155.80] on the handle of the pitcher
[2155.80 → 2157.96] she fell down herself
[2157.96 → 2159.46] and so did the pitcher
[2159.46 → 2162.04] and it shattered on the sidewalk
[2162.04 → 2163.76] spilling all the milk
[2163.76 → 2164.60] into the gutter
[2164.60 → 2166.84] there she sat
[2166.84 → 2167.46] crying
[2167.46 → 2168.56] her eyes out
[2168.56 → 2169.76] inconsolable
[2169.76 → 2171.44] so Morehouse
[2171.44 → 2172.36] rushed over to her
[2172.36 → 2173.34] to see if she was okay
[2173.34 → 2174.40] to help her
[2174.40 → 2175.42] up on her feet
[2175.42 → 2176.56] and he said
[2176.56 → 2177.18] don't cry
[2177.18 → 2178.66] it's going to be okay
[2178.66 → 2180.04] and she said
[2180.04 → 2181.48] no it's not going to be alright
[2181.48 → 2183.24] my mom's going to whip me
[2183.24 → 2184.94] because I broke the pitcher
[2184.94 → 2187.40] no she won't
[2187.40 → 2188.38] Morehouse assured her
[2188.38 → 2189.24] I'll help you
[2189.24 → 2190.76] put the pitcher back together again
[2190.76 → 2193.02] so Morehouse reached down
[2193.02 → 2194.30] and he started to gather
[2194.30 → 2195.04] the shards
[2195.04 → 2197.32] and try to place the pitcher
[2197.32 → 2198.24] back together
[2198.24 → 2200.96] and he got it halfway up
[2200.96 → 2202.84] and it crashed down again
[2202.84 → 2204.30] and the little girl
[2204.30 → 2205.38] started to cry again
[2205.38 → 2206.96] and he said
[2206.96 → 2208.44] oh let's try one more time
[2208.44 → 2209.08] we can do it
[2209.08 → 2211.02] so he picked up the pieces
[2211.02 → 2212.26] and he finally got
[2212.26 → 2213.50] most of it together
[2213.50 → 2215.66] so that it could then
[2215.66 → 2216.34] be repaired
[2216.34 → 2218.10] but as they were placing
[2218.10 → 2219.38] the handle back on
[2219.38 → 2220.86] it all tumbled
[2220.86 → 2222.62] into a pile again
[2222.62 → 2224.52] and that was the end of it
[2224.52 → 2225.58] the girl was completely
[2225.58 → 2226.44] beside herself
[2226.44 → 2228.34] it just seemed hopeless
[2228.34 → 2231.44] well Morehouse
[2231.44 → 2232.36] picked her up
[2232.36 → 2234.10] and carried her
[2234.10 → 2235.86] to the nearby pottery shop
[2235.86 → 2236.92] and bought her
[2236.92 → 2237.92] a new pitcher
[2237.92 → 2240.10] and then he took
[2240.10 → 2240.70] the little girl
[2240.70 → 2241.68] back to the grocer
[2241.68 → 2243.28] and he filled that pitcher
[2243.28 → 2244.28] up with milk
[2244.28 → 2246.20] and then carrying her
[2246.20 → 2247.00] in one arm
[2247.00 → 2247.56] in the pitcher
[2247.56 → 2248.06] in the other
[2248.06 → 2249.46] he took her home
[2249.46 → 2251.24] and he knocked on the door
[2251.24 → 2253.26] and before she went in
[2253.26 → 2253.92] he said to her
[2253.92 → 2254.70] do you think your mom's
[2254.70 → 2255.40] going to whip you now
[2255.40 → 2256.82] and she said
[2256.82 → 2257.40] oh no
[2257.40 → 2259.14] because now we have
[2259.14 → 2259.88] a better pitcher
[2259.88 → 2260.54] than before
[2260.54 → 2262.82] and friends
[2262.82 → 2264.20] that story illustrates
[2264.20 → 2265.32] our experience
[2265.32 → 2265.86] of grace
[2265.86 → 2267.70] Paul says
[2267.70 → 2268.36] in verse 5
[2268.36 → 2269.04] in our passage
[2269.04 → 2270.52] we were dead
[2270.52 → 2272.16] in transgressions
[2272.16 → 2273.72] and that is
[2273.72 → 2274.88] our life in Adam
[2274.88 → 2276.44] our sinful nature
[2276.44 → 2277.28] we have been
[2277.28 → 2277.72] shattered
[2277.72 → 2278.66] on the sidewalk
[2278.66 → 2279.82] our life
[2279.82 → 2280.48] has been poured
[2280.48 → 2281.14] out of us
[2281.14 → 2282.80] and there is no way
[2282.80 → 2283.82] to put this pitcher
[2283.82 → 2285.00] back together again
[2285.00 → 2285.92] there is certainly
[2285.92 → 2286.38] no way
[2286.38 → 2287.12] to gather
[2287.12 → 2287.94] the spilt milk
[2287.94 → 2290.96] but people keep
[2290.96 → 2292.16] trying to please God
[2292.16 → 2292.80] by putting
[2292.80 → 2294.52] our own pieces
[2294.52 → 2295.66] back together again
[2295.66 → 2298.00] and in the midst
[2298.00 → 2299.54] of our tears
[2299.54 → 2301.42] and the sadness
[2301.42 → 2302.92] that is broken humanity
[2302.92 → 2305.40] we have to be picked up
[2305.40 → 2306.12] by one
[2306.12 → 2307.36] who is gracious
[2307.36 → 2308.12] and loving
[2308.12 → 2309.96] we have to be taken
[2309.96 → 2311.34] to a place
[2311.34 → 2312.14] where we can be given
[2312.14 → 2312.82] a new pitcher
[2312.82 → 2315.00] and our lives refilled
[2315.00 → 2315.68] and then brought
[2315.68 → 2316.50] back home
[2316.50 → 2318.02] and friends
[2318.02 → 2318.72] that is what Jesus
[2318.72 → 2319.60] has done for us
[2319.60 → 2321.58] we are broken people
[2321.58 → 2323.14] we can't present
[2323.14 → 2324.46] God with anything
[2324.46 → 2326.36] we need a new nature
[2326.36 → 2327.46] we need a new life
[2327.46 → 2328.38] and that is exactly
[2328.38 → 2329.60] what happens
[2329.60 → 2330.24] to us
[2330.24 → 2330.78] when God
[2330.78 → 2331.32] is gracious
[2331.32 → 2332.02] to us
[2332.02 → 2334.10] and that's what
[2334.10 → 2334.96] this word means
[2334.96 → 2335.98] that is so important
[2335.98 → 2336.70] to the Bible
[2336.70 → 2337.48] grace
[2337.48 → 2339.70] grace grace grace
[2339.70 → 2340.16] we know
[2340.16 → 2341.16] we say it all the time
[2341.16 → 2342.22] sometimes we
[2342.22 → 2342.84] kind of forget
[2342.84 → 2343.62] what it means
[2343.62 → 2346.22] but like in the story
[2346.22 → 2347.28] God's grace
[2347.28 → 2348.82] is his generosity
[2348.82 → 2350.68] and his gift
[2350.68 → 2351.42] to us
[2351.42 → 2353.20] his generosity
[2353.20 → 2353.98] his gift
[2353.98 → 2355.42] I may not know
[2355.42 → 2356.02] when someone is being
[2356.02 → 2356.86] gracious to me
[2356.86 → 2357.78] it's kind of more
[2357.78 → 2358.88] gracious okay
[2358.88 → 2360.72] but I do know
[2360.72 → 2362.50] and I can recognize
[2362.50 → 2363.40] generosity
[2363.40 → 2366.80] you didn't have
[2366.80 → 2368.12] to do that for me
[2368.12 → 2370.30] and yet you did
[2370.30 → 2373.86] you accepted me
[2373.86 → 2375.92] when I was
[2375.92 → 2376.54] unacceptable
[2376.54 → 2379.96] you forgave me
[2379.96 → 2381.52] when I wasn't
[2381.52 → 2382.32] forgivable
[2382.32 → 2385.36] you were kind
[2385.36 → 2386.96] when I didn't
[2386.96 → 2387.54] deserve it
[2387.54 → 2389.94] you made room
[2389.94 → 2390.76] for me
[2390.76 → 2392.46] when I didn't
[2392.46 → 2393.02] belong
[2393.02 → 2395.34] right we all
[2395.34 → 2396.32] recognize
[2396.32 → 2397.46] generosity
[2397.46 → 2397.60] generosity
[2397.60 → 2399.04] and it's this
[2399.04 → 2400.06] entire experience
[2400.06 → 2400.62] of God
[2400.62 → 2401.66] doing something
[2401.66 → 2402.38] for us
[2402.38 → 2402.78] that we can
[2402.78 → 2403.50] never do for
[2403.50 → 2404.00] ourselves
[2404.00 → 2404.82] and that we
[2404.82 → 2405.52] don't deserve
[2405.52 → 2408.50] now let's go
[2408.50 → 2409.08] back to the
[2409.08 → 2410.08] Morehouse story
[2410.08 → 2410.76] for a moment
[2410.76 → 2412.70] all that
[2412.70 → 2414.06] he did for
[2414.06 → 2414.92] this little girl
[2414.92 → 2416.52] was of grace
[2416.52 → 2418.08] right and if
[2418.08 → 2418.78] anybody asked
[2418.78 → 2419.98] well why did
[2419.98 → 2420.68] he does it
[2420.68 → 2422.64] I imagine
[2422.64 → 2424.10] I don't want to
[2424.10 → 2424.66] put words in his
[2424.66 → 2425.22] mouth but I
[2425.22 → 2426.18] imagine he would
[2426.18 → 2427.00] simply say
[2427.00 → 2428.16] that it
[2428.16 → 2428.68] pleased him
[2428.68 → 2429.26] to do it
[2429.26 → 2430.52] right he
[2430.52 → 2430.98] found it
[2430.98 → 2431.54] within his
[2431.54 → 2432.16] heart to
[2432.16 → 2433.18] stop and
[2433.18 → 2433.74] to help
[2433.74 → 2434.76] this girl
[2434.76 → 2435.42] solve her
[2435.42 → 2435.82] problem
[2435.82 → 2437.60] and in the
[2437.60 → 2438.00] same way
[2438.00 → 2438.46] it is in
[2438.46 → 2438.94] the heart
[2438.94 → 2439.58] of God
[2439.58 → 2440.10] to love
[2440.10 → 2440.46] us
[2440.46 → 2441.82] that's what
[2441.82 → 2442.34] Paul tells
[2442.34 → 2442.64] us here
[2442.64 → 2442.96] in verse
[2442.96 → 2443.28] four
[2443.28 → 2446.00] but because
[2446.00 → 2446.58] of his
[2446.58 → 2447.48] great love
[2447.48 → 2448.24] for us
[2448.24 → 2448.82] God who
[2448.82 → 2449.28] is rich
[2449.28 → 2449.78] in mercy
[2449.78 → 2451.08] made us
[2451.08 → 2451.70] alive with
[2451.70 → 2452.00] Christ
[2452.00 → 2452.72] even when
[2452.72 → 2453.20] we were
[2453.20 → 2453.58] dead
[2453.58 → 2455.00] in transgressions
[2455.00 → 2456.74] so friends
[2456.74 → 2457.10] that's what
[2457.10 → 2457.76] grace is
[2457.76 → 2460.00] why did
[2460.00 → 2460.48] he save
[2460.48 → 2460.80] us and
[2460.80 → 2461.58] rescue us
[2461.58 → 2462.84] because of
[2462.84 → 2463.52] his great
[2463.52 → 2464.52] love for
[2464.52 → 2464.84] us
[2464.84 → 2465.64] because he
[2465.64 → 2466.28] is a God
[2466.28 → 2467.16] who is rich
[2467.16 → 2467.70] in mercy
[2467.70 → 2468.28] this is who
[2468.28 → 2468.64] our God
[2468.64 → 2469.08] is
[2469.08 → 2470.88] you know
[2470.88 → 2471.12] I think
[2471.12 → 2471.42] there's a
[2471.42 → 2472.00] very useful
[2472.00 → 2472.58] acrostic
[2472.58 → 2473.42] that's been
[2473.42 → 2473.94] used over
[2473.94 → 2474.58] the years
[2474.58 → 2476.50] you have
[2476.50 → 2477.16] grace
[2477.16 → 2479.16] g-r-a-c
[2479.16 → 2479.58] down the
[2479.58 → 2479.90] side
[2479.90 → 2480.28] and it
[2480.28 → 2480.90] stands for
[2480.90 → 2482.16] God's riches
[2482.16 → 2483.14] at Christ's
[2483.14 → 2483.62] expense
[2483.62 → 2484.58] have you
[2484.58 → 2484.84] have you
[2484.84 → 2485.30] heard this
[2485.30 → 2489.10] that's what
[2489.10 → 2489.74] grace is
[2489.74 → 2491.08] it took
[2491.08 → 2491.72] Christ's
[2491.72 → 2492.06] death
[2492.06 → 2492.70] for us
[2492.70 → 2493.08] to have
[2493.08 → 2493.62] the riches
[2493.62 → 2494.18] of eternal
[2494.18 → 2494.62] life
[2494.62 → 2495.52] with God
[2495.52 → 2497.14] and this
[2497.14 → 2497.44] friends
[2497.44 → 2497.96] is the
[2497.96 → 2498.54] universal
[2498.54 → 2499.40] experience
[2499.40 → 2500.62] and though
[2500.62 → 2500.92] it can
[2500.92 → 2501.38] come in
[2501.38 → 2501.90] a million
[2501.90 → 2502.34] different
[2502.34 → 2502.72] ways
[2502.72 → 2503.34] our being
[2503.34 → 2504.16] made alive
[2504.16 → 2505.12] our deliverance
[2505.12 → 2505.88] began not
[2505.88 → 2506.30] with us
[2506.30 → 2507.12] loving God
[2507.12 → 2508.08] but with
[2508.08 → 2508.52] God
[2508.52 → 2509.26] loving
[2509.26 → 2510.16] us
[2510.16 → 2511.94] so no
[2511.94 → 2512.20] matter
[2512.20 → 2513.04] how we
[2513.04 → 2513.48] came to
[2513.48 → 2513.84] know
[2513.84 → 2514.60] Christ
[2514.60 → 2515.10] and whatever
[2515.10 → 2516.10] time in
[2516.10 → 2516.58] the ages
[2516.58 → 2516.94] and in
[2516.94 → 2517.32] the world
[2517.32 → 2517.96] that is
[2517.96 → 2518.68] the experience
[2518.68 → 2519.26] that all
[2519.26 → 2519.56] of us
[2519.56 → 2519.94] have
[2519.94 → 2520.96] God
[2520.96 → 2521.64] was gracious
[2521.64 → 2522.16] to me
[2522.16 → 2523.32] that is
[2523.32 → 2524.00] our testimony
[2524.00 → 2524.78] so that's
[2524.78 → 2525.18] grace
[2525.18 → 2526.54] now what
[2526.54 → 2526.72] about
[2526.72 → 2527.22] faith
[2527.22 → 2529.08] our passage
[2529.08 → 2529.66] says
[2529.66 → 2530.90] again we'll
[2530.90 → 2531.32] put it up
[2531.32 → 2531.68] here
[2531.68 → 2532.20] for
[2532.20 → 2533.24] it is by
[2533.24 → 2533.70] grace
[2533.70 → 2534.50] you have
[2534.50 → 2535.04] been saved
[2535.04 → 2535.60] through
[2535.60 → 2536.10] faith
[2536.10 → 2536.88] and this
[2536.88 → 2537.14] is not
[2537.14 → 2537.32] from
[2537.32 → 2537.74] yourselves
[2537.74 → 2538.16] it is
[2538.16 → 2538.48] the gift
[2538.48 → 2538.86] of God
[2538.86 → 2539.32] not by
[2539.32 → 2539.58] work
[2539.58 → 2539.98] so that no
[2539.98 → 2540.24] one can
[2540.24 → 2540.58] boast
[2540.58 → 2541.50] so what's
[2541.50 → 2541.88] faith
[2541.88 → 2543.84] how does
[2543.84 → 2544.38] this fountain
[2544.38 → 2544.92] of God's
[2544.92 → 2545.18] grace
[2545.18 → 2545.44] that is
[2545.44 → 2545.68] just
[2545.68 → 2546.84] keeps bubbling
[2546.84 → 2547.38] forth
[2547.38 → 2548.34] and overflowing
[2548.34 → 2548.90] his love
[2548.90 → 2549.54] his mercy
[2549.54 → 2550.32] how does
[2550.32 → 2550.64] that get
[2550.64 → 2551.12] channelled
[2551.12 → 2551.98] toward me
[2551.98 → 2553.08] right
[2553.08 → 2553.36] how does
[2553.36 → 2553.86] this great
[2553.86 → 2554.20] grace
[2554.20 → 2554.92] become mine
[2554.92 → 2555.28] on a
[2555.28 → 2555.98] personal
[2555.98 → 2556.60] basis
[2556.60 → 2557.88] and so
[2557.88 → 2558.16] let's
[2558.16 → 2558.56] look at
[2558.56 → 2558.96] this word
[2558.96 → 2559.26] for a
[2559.26 → 2559.50] moment
[2559.50 → 2559.98] first
[2559.98 → 2560.66] there's
[2560.66 → 2561.04] a common
[2561.04 → 2561.68] misunderstanding
[2561.68 → 2562.40] about
[2562.40 → 2562.76] faith
[2562.76 → 2563.42] that it
[2563.42 → 2563.60] has
[2563.60 → 2563.92] something
[2563.92 → 2565.60] to do
[2565.60 → 2565.82] with
[2565.82 → 2566.44] subjective
[2566.44 → 2567.12] feeling
[2567.12 → 2568.48] and we
[2568.48 → 2568.82] say this
[2568.82 → 2569.08] all the
[2569.08 → 2569.34] time
[2569.34 → 2570.42] we say
[2570.42 → 2570.74] well
[2570.74 → 2571.58] I just
[2571.58 → 2571.80] have
[2571.80 → 2572.14] faith
[2572.14 → 2572.52] that he's
[2572.52 → 2572.70] going to
[2572.70 → 2572.92] pull
[2572.92 → 2573.14] through
[2573.14 → 2573.44] on this
[2573.44 → 2573.68] one
[2573.68 → 2575.62] or we
[2575.62 → 2576.10] can say
[2576.10 → 2576.46] you know
[2576.46 → 2577.72] you can
[2577.72 → 2578.02] just have
[2578.02 → 2578.40] faith
[2578.40 → 2578.70] that the
[2578.70 → 2579.00] quarterback
[2579.00 → 2579.52] is going
[2579.52 → 2580.02] to complete
[2580.02 → 2580.58] the pass
[2580.58 → 2581.10] to the
[2581.10 → 2581.50] receiver
[2581.50 → 2582.12] score
[2582.12 → 2582.52] touchdown
[2582.52 → 2584.40] I don't
[2584.40 → 2585.52] know
[2585.52 → 2586.32] I don't
[2586.32 → 2587.46] know
[2587.46 → 2587.98] I don't
[2587.98 → 2588.28] I hope
[2588.28 → 2588.62] he will
[2588.62 → 2590.60] but that
[2590.60 → 2590.88] friends
[2590.88 → 2591.48] is not
[2591.48 → 2592.54] the type
[2592.54 → 2592.80] of thing
[2592.80 → 2593.16] that God
[2593.16 → 2593.62] is talking
[2593.62 → 2594.20] about here
[2594.20 → 2595.60] faith
[2595.60 → 2595.98] biblical
[2595.98 → 2596.48] faith
[2596.48 → 2597.46] is a
[2597.46 → 2598.04] confident
[2598.04 → 2598.82] trust
[2598.82 → 2599.74] and reliance
[2599.74 → 2600.18] upon
[2600.18 → 2600.50] Jesus
[2600.50 → 2601.02] Christ
[2601.02 → 2602.74] and this
[2602.74 → 2603.12] faith
[2603.12 → 2603.48] is
[2603.48 → 2604.22] trustworthy
[2604.22 → 2605.76] because
[2605.76 → 2606.64] the object
[2606.64 → 2607.40] of our
[2607.40 → 2607.72] faith
[2607.72 → 2608.38] is trustworthy
[2608.38 → 2610.26] so Tim
[2610.26 → 2610.60] Keller
[2610.60 → 2611.12] gives this
[2611.12 → 2611.62] illustration
[2611.62 → 2612.16] in his
[2612.16 → 2612.40] book
[2612.40 → 2612.84] the reason
[2612.84 → 2613.36] for God
[2613.36 → 2614.66] he says
[2614.66 → 2615.46] imagine you
[2615.46 → 2616.10] are on a
[2616.10 → 2617.00] high cliff
[2617.00 → 2617.94] and you
[2617.94 → 2618.48] lose your
[2618.48 → 2618.74] footing
[2618.74 → 2619.04] and you
[2619.04 → 2619.42] begin to
[2619.42 → 2619.68] fall
[2619.68 → 2619.92] you're
[2619.92 → 2620.20] falling
[2620.20 → 2620.44] through
[2620.44 → 2620.88] the air
[2620.88 → 2622.36] just
[2622.36 → 2623.74] beside
[2623.74 → 2624.14] you
[2624.14 → 2624.66] as you're
[2624.66 → 2625.00] falling
[2625.00 → 2626.14] you see
[2626.14 → 2626.72] a branch
[2626.72 → 2627.50] sticking out
[2627.50 → 2627.80] of the
[2627.80 → 2628.02] edge
[2628.02 → 2628.22] of the
[2628.22 → 2628.56] cliff
[2628.56 → 2629.94] it is
[2629.94 → 2630.14] your
[2630.14 → 2630.88] only hope
[2630.88 → 2631.60] and it
[2631.60 → 2631.92] seems
[2631.92 → 2632.52] more than
[2632.52 → 2632.80] strong
[2632.80 → 2633.22] enough
[2633.22 → 2634.46] so how
[2634.46 → 2634.78] can that
[2634.78 → 2635.06] branch
[2635.06 → 2635.42] save
[2635.42 → 2635.64] you
[2635.64 → 2637.44] if you
[2637.44 → 2637.66] are
[2637.66 → 2638.24] totally
[2638.24 → 2639.20] certain
[2639.20 → 2639.96] the
[2639.96 → 2640.34] branch
[2640.34 → 2640.86] can
[2640.86 → 2641.50] support
[2641.50 → 2641.94] you
[2641.94 → 2642.86] but you
[2642.86 → 2643.38] don't
[2643.38 → 2643.76] actually
[2643.76 → 2644.34] reach out
[2644.34 → 2644.70] and grab
[2644.70 → 2645.00] onto
[2645.00 → 2645.32] it
[2645.32 → 2646.72] well what
[2646.72 → 2647.14] happens
[2647.14 → 2648.76] you're
[2648.76 → 2649.00] just going
[2649.00 → 2649.24] to keep
[2649.24 → 2649.52] falling
[2649.52 → 2649.80] you are
[2649.80 → 2650.18] lost
[2650.18 → 2652.00] if instead
[2652.00 → 2652.76] your mind
[2652.76 → 2653.56] is suddenly
[2653.56 → 2654.36] filled with
[2654.36 → 2654.94] doubt
[2654.94 → 2656.18] and uncertainty
[2656.18 → 2656.82] that the
[2656.82 → 2657.22] branch can
[2657.22 → 2657.66] hold you
[2657.66 → 2658.26] but you
[2658.26 → 2658.80] reach out
[2658.80 → 2659.06] and you
[2659.06 → 2659.88] grab onto
[2659.88 → 2660.26] it
[2660.26 → 2661.88] you will
[2661.88 → 2662.38] be saved
[2662.38 → 2663.80] why
[2663.80 → 2665.72] because it
[2665.72 → 2666.14] is not
[2666.14 → 2666.90] the strength
[2666.90 → 2667.34] of your
[2667.34 → 2667.92] faith
[2667.92 → 2668.76] but the
[2668.76 → 2669.26] object
[2669.26 → 2669.92] of your
[2669.92 → 2670.30] faith
[2670.30 → 2670.90] that actually
[2670.90 → 2671.42] saves you
[2671.42 → 2672.84] you can
[2672.84 → 2673.46] believe all
[2673.46 → 2674.40] you want
[2674.40 → 2675.50] in a weak
[2675.50 → 2676.04] branch
[2676.04 → 2677.04] but that
[2677.04 → 2677.46] doesn't mean
[2677.46 → 2677.86] the branch
[2677.86 → 2678.28] can save
[2678.28 → 2678.50] you
[2678.50 → 2679.70] you can
[2679.70 → 2680.58] have 100%
[2680.58 → 2681.00] confidence
[2681.00 → 2681.50] in this
[2681.50 → 2681.84] branch
[2681.84 → 2683.64] but it
[2683.64 → 2683.92] could just
[2683.92 → 2684.28] snap
[2684.28 → 2686.38] or you
[2686.38 → 2686.82] can have
[2686.82 → 2687.82] weak faith
[2687.82 → 2688.22] in a
[2688.22 → 2688.70] strong
[2688.70 → 2689.38] branch
[2689.38 → 2690.94] and that
[2690.94 → 2691.42] branch
[2691.42 → 2692.24] will save
[2692.24 → 2692.38] you
[2692.38 → 2692.54] no
[2692.54 → 2692.80] matter
[2692.80 → 2693.36] how
[2693.36 → 2693.66] you
[2693.66 → 2694.52] feel
[2694.52 → 2694.76] about
[2694.76 → 2695.10] it
[2695.10 → 2696.10] and that
[2696.10 → 2696.44] strong
[2696.44 → 2697.10] branch
[2697.10 → 2697.40] friends
[2697.40 → 2697.70] is
[2697.70 → 2698.00] Jesus
[2698.00 → 2698.44] Christ
[2698.44 → 2699.80] and so
[2699.80 → 2700.02] let me
[2700.02 → 2700.34] ask you
[2700.34 → 2700.72] this morning
[2700.72 → 2701.66] what are
[2701.66 → 2702.10] you believing
[2702.10 → 2702.44] in
[2702.44 → 2703.98] right
[2703.98 → 2704.56] what are
[2704.56 → 2705.28] you trusting
[2705.28 → 2705.70] in
[2705.70 → 2706.70] really
[2706.70 → 2708.14] right
[2708.14 → 2708.54] what would
[2708.54 → 2708.98] you say
[2708.98 → 2709.46] about your
[2709.46 → 2709.76] life
[2709.76 → 2710.18] like my
[2710.18 → 2710.52] life
[2710.52 → 2711.08] is safe
[2711.08 → 2711.50] in the
[2711.50 → 2711.84] hands
[2711.84 → 2712.20] of
[2712.20 → 2712.98] that
[2712.98 → 2714.20] person
[2714.20 → 2714.78] or that
[2714.78 → 2715.22] thing
[2715.22 → 2716.04] or that
[2716.04 → 2716.66] accomplishment
[2716.66 → 2718.46] and friends
[2718.46 → 2718.74] let me
[2718.74 → 2719.16] tell you
[2719.16 → 2719.88] your life
[2719.88 → 2720.54] is safe
[2720.54 → 2720.90] in the
[2720.90 → 2721.10] hands
[2721.10 → 2721.24] of
[2721.24 → 2721.46] Jesus
[2721.46 → 2721.88] Christ
[2721.88 → 2722.62] it's
[2722.62 → 2722.82] not
[2722.82 → 2723.16] safe
[2723.16 → 2723.70] anywhere
[2723.70 → 2724.22] else
[2724.22 → 2724.80] every
[2724.80 → 2725.14] other
[2725.14 → 2725.64] branch
[2725.64 → 2726.78] cannot
[2726.78 → 2727.78] save
[2727.78 → 2728.00] you
[2728.00 → 2729.96] so
[2729.96 → 2730.30] biblical
[2730.30 → 2730.66] faith
[2730.66 → 2730.84] is
[2730.84 → 2731.24] trustworthy
[2731.24 → 2731.66] not
[2731.66 → 2732.20] because
[2732.20 → 2733.00] of
[2733.00 → 2733.34] our
[2733.34 → 2733.76] faith
[2733.76 → 2733.98] but
[2733.98 → 2734.26] because
[2734.26 → 2734.58] of the
[2734.58 → 2735.04] object
[2735.04 → 2735.50] of our
[2735.50 → 2735.92] faith
[2735.92 → 2736.68] that is
[2736.68 → 2737.06] trustworthy
[2737.06 → 2738.94] so let me
[2738.94 → 2739.22] go over
[2739.22 → 2739.78] three quick
[2739.78 → 2740.34] things with
[2740.34 → 2740.86] you about
[2740.86 → 2741.24] biblical
[2741.24 → 2741.68] faith
[2741.68 → 2742.50] it has
[2742.50 → 2743.12] three parts
[2743.12 → 2743.46] to it
[2743.46 → 2744.04] and I think
[2744.04 → 2744.42] it's very
[2744.42 → 2744.78] much
[2744.78 → 2745.84] similar to
[2745.84 → 2746.38] the process
[2746.38 → 2746.76] of when
[2746.76 → 2747.52] two people
[2747.52 → 2748.20] meet
[2748.20 → 2749.30] and fall
[2749.30 → 2749.70] in love
[2749.70 → 2750.44] and become
[2750.44 → 2750.74] married
[2750.74 → 2753.94] so first
[2753.94 → 2754.42] the thing
[2754.42 → 2754.84] you need to
[2754.84 → 2755.24] know about
[2755.24 → 2755.60] faith
[2755.60 → 2755.96] is that
[2755.96 → 2756.58] it requires
[2756.58 → 2757.24] knowledge
[2757.24 → 2758.48] you have
[2758.48 → 2758.94] to hear
[2758.94 → 2759.48] the gospel
[2759.48 → 2760.02] story
[2760.02 → 2760.82] right
[2760.82 → 2761.22] there's no
[2761.22 → 2761.64] faith in
[2761.64 → 2761.88] God
[2761.88 → 2762.16] without
[2762.16 → 2762.78] knowledge
[2762.78 → 2763.20] of
[2763.20 → 2764.10] the gospel
[2764.10 → 2764.70] above
[2764.70 → 2765.22] who
[2765.22 → 2765.66] Jesus
[2765.66 → 2766.00] is
[2766.00 → 2766.32] and what
[2766.32 → 2766.80] he has
[2766.80 → 2767.02] done
[2767.02 → 2767.44] for you
[2767.44 → 2768.80] that's
[2768.80 → 2768.94] why
[2768.94 → 2769.22] Paul
[2769.22 → 2769.70] tells
[2769.70 → 2769.88] us
[2769.88 → 2770.30] all of
[2770.30 → 2770.54] these
[2770.54 → 2770.96] things
[2770.96 → 2771.36] about
[2771.36 → 2771.66] our
[2771.66 → 2772.12] salvation
[2772.12 → 2772.88] in
[2772.88 → 2773.08] our
[2773.08 → 2773.44] passage
[2773.44 → 2773.70] this
[2773.70 → 2773.96] morning
[2773.96 → 2774.50] let's
[2774.50 → 2774.66] just
[2774.66 → 2774.88] read
[2774.88 → 2775.00] it
[2775.00 → 2775.36] again
[2775.36 → 2776.90] he
[2776.90 → 2777.34] says
[2777.34 → 2777.60] but
[2777.60 → 2778.06] because
[2778.06 → 2778.24] of
[2778.24 → 2778.38] his
[2778.38 → 2778.60] great
[2778.60 → 2778.96] love
[2778.96 → 2779.22] for
[2779.22 → 2779.44] us
[2779.44 → 2779.80] God
[2779.80 → 2779.94] who
[2779.94 → 2780.06] is
[2780.06 → 2780.36] rich
[2780.36 → 2780.52] in
[2780.52 → 2780.82] mercy
[2780.82 → 2781.28] he
[2781.28 → 2781.54] made
[2781.54 → 2781.74] us
[2781.74 → 2782.20] alive
[2782.20 → 2782.98] with
[2782.98 → 2783.78] Christ
[2783.78 → 2784.82] even
[2784.82 → 2785.08] when
[2785.08 → 2785.20] we
[2785.20 → 2785.34] were
[2785.34 → 2785.58] dead
[2785.58 → 2785.76] in
[2785.76 → 2786.52] transgressions
[2786.52 → 2786.98] it
[2786.98 → 2787.26] is
[2787.26 → 2787.46] by
[2787.46 → 2787.90] grace
[2787.90 → 2788.06] you
[2788.06 → 2788.30] have
[2788.30 → 2788.52] been
[2788.52 → 2789.00] saved
[2789.00 → 2790.34] and
[2790.34 → 2790.60] God
[2790.60 → 2791.00] raised
[2791.00 → 2791.20] us
[2791.20 → 2791.44] up
[2791.44 → 2791.84] with
[2791.84 → 2792.40] Christ
[2792.40 → 2793.10] seated
[2793.10 → 2793.42] us
[2793.42 → 2793.82] with
[2793.82 → 2794.28] him
[2794.28 → 2794.82] in
[2794.82 → 2794.96] the
[2794.96 → 2795.18] heavenly
[2795.18 → 2795.56] realms
[2795.56 → 2795.94] in
[2795.94 → 2796.24] Christ
[2796.24 → 2796.62] Jesus
[2796.62 → 2797.50] in
[2797.50 → 2797.68] order
[2797.68 → 2797.92] that
[2797.92 → 2798.10] in
[2798.10 → 2798.22] the
[2798.22 → 2798.44] coming
[2798.44 → 2798.80] ages
[2798.80 → 2799.04] he
[2799.04 → 2799.20] might
[2799.20 → 2799.48] show
[2799.48 → 2799.68] the
[2799.68 → 2800.28] incomparable
[2800.28 → 2800.64] riches
[2800.64 → 2800.84] of
[2800.84 → 2800.98] his
[2800.98 → 2801.28] grace
[2801.28 → 2802.10] expressed
[2802.10 → 2802.48] to
[2802.48 → 2802.78] us
[2802.78 → 2802.96] in
[2807.34 → 2808.36] four
[2808.36 → 2808.98] times
[2808.98 → 2811.06] Christ
[2811.06 → 2811.64] Christ
[2811.64 → 2812.00] Christ
[2812.00 → 2812.32] I
[2812.32 → 2812.54] think
[2812.54 → 2812.76] he's
[2812.76 → 2812.96] trying
[2812.96 → 2813.10] to
[2813.10 → 2813.26] say
[2813.26 → 2813.64] something
[2813.64 → 2815.12] it's
[2815.12 → 2815.36] all
[2815.36 → 2815.70] about
[2815.70 → 2816.26] God's
[2816.26 → 2816.58] love
[2816.58 → 2816.96] for
[2816.96 → 2817.40] us
[2817.40 → 2817.68] in
[2817.68 → 2817.86] and
[2817.86 → 2818.18] through
[2818.18 → 2819.52] Jesus
[2819.52 → 2820.08] Christ
[2820.08 → 2821.56] you
[2821.56 → 2821.62] know
[2821.62 → 2821.90] friends
[2821.90 → 2822.08] there
[2822.08 → 2822.32] are
[2822.32 → 2822.76] many
[2822.76 → 2823.42] wonderful
[2823.42 → 2823.98] teachers
[2823.98 → 2824.92] and
[2824.92 → 2825.26] prophets
[2825.26 → 2825.52] out
[2825.52 → 2825.78] there
[2825.78 → 2827.08] there
[2827.08 → 2827.22] are
[2827.22 → 2827.54] many
[2827.54 → 2828.02] not so
[2828.02 → 2828.28] wonderful
[2828.28 → 2828.84] gods
[2828.84 → 2830.04] that
[2830.04 → 2830.28] people
[2830.28 → 2830.64] believe
[2830.64 → 2830.88] in
[2830.88 → 2831.70] but
[2831.70 → 2832.20] eternal
[2832.20 → 2832.52] life
[2832.52 → 2832.70] is
[2832.70 → 2832.94] found
[2832.94 → 2833.40] only
[2833.40 → 2833.88] in
[2833.88 → 2834.34] Jesus
[2834.34 → 2834.78] Christ
[2834.78 → 2836.02] and
[2836.02 → 2836.26] I
[2836.26 → 2836.66] know
[2836.66 → 2836.84] that
[2836.84 → 2837.16] sounds
[2837.16 → 2837.66] offensive
[2837.66 → 2838.76] in
[2838.76 → 2838.92] the
[2838.92 → 2839.28] ears
[2839.28 → 2839.52] of
[2839.52 → 2839.74] our
[2839.74 → 2840.10] modern
[2840.10 → 2840.52] world
[2840.52 → 2841.34] but
[2841.34 → 2841.52] it
[2841.52 → 2841.66] is
[2841.66 → 2841.90] not
[2841.90 → 2842.22] loving
[2842.22 → 2842.52] for
[2842.52 → 2842.70] the
[2842.70 → 2842.94] church
[2842.94 → 2843.16] to
[2843.16 → 2843.46] pretend
[2843.46 → 2843.68] that
[2843.68 → 2844.06] maybe
[2844.06 → 2844.60] there
[2844.60 → 2844.88] is
[2844.88 → 2845.22] eternal
[2845.22 → 2845.50] life
[2845.50 → 2845.68] found
[2845.68 → 2845.98] somewhere
[2845.98 → 2846.36] else
[2846.36 → 2847.74] what's
[2847.74 → 2847.96] taught
[2847.96 → 2848.08] in
[2848.08 → 2848.20] the
[2848.20 → 2848.46] Bible
[2848.46 → 2848.84] is
[2848.84 → 2848.96] that
[2848.96 → 2849.18] because
[2849.18 → 2849.36] of
[2849.36 → 2849.54] his
[2849.54 → 2849.90] love
[2849.90 → 2850.20] for
[2850.20 → 2850.36] us
[2850.36 → 2850.62] God
[2850.62 → 2850.94] makes
[2850.94 → 2851.10] us
[2851.10 → 2851.58] alive
[2851.58 → 2852.56] with
[2852.56 → 2853.00] Christ
[2853.00 → 2855.38] so
[2855.38 → 2855.50] you
[2855.50 → 2855.70] have
[2855.70 → 2855.84] to
[2855.84 → 2856.14] know
[2856.14 → 2856.36] what
[2856.36 → 2856.50] you
[2856.50 → 2857.04] believe
[2857.04 → 2857.34] and
[2857.34 → 2857.62] that's
[2857.62 → 2857.74] what
[2857.74 → 2857.92] Paul
[2857.92 → 2858.18] says
[2858.18 → 2858.60] elsewhere
[2858.60 → 2858.80] in
[2858.80 → 2859.16] Romans
[2859.16 → 2859.82] chapter
[2859.82 → 2860.24] 10
[2860.24 → 2861.44] he
[2861.44 → 2861.66] says
[2861.66 → 2862.16] faith
[2862.16 → 2862.82] comes
[2862.82 → 2862.98] from
[2862.98 → 2863.22] hearing
[2863.22 → 2863.42] the
[2863.42 → 2863.94] message
[2863.94 → 2864.32] the
[2864.32 → 2864.60] message
[2864.60 → 2864.80] is
[2864.80 → 2865.16] heard
[2865.16 → 2865.66] through
[2865.66 → 2865.84] the
[2865.84 → 2866.10] word
[2866.10 → 2866.54] about
[2866.54 → 2867.18] Christ
[2867.18 → 2869.70] but
[2869.70 → 2869.88] there's
[2869.88 → 2870.00] a
[2870.00 → 2870.22] second
[2870.22 → 2870.58] part
[2870.58 → 2870.78] of
[2870.78 → 2871.28] faith
[2871.28 → 2872.04] and
[2872.04 → 2872.26] that
[2872.26 → 2872.48] is
[2872.48 → 2872.64] the
[2872.64 → 2872.90] heart
[2872.90 → 2873.64] response
[2873.64 → 2874.76] so
[2874.76 → 2875.12] after
[2875.12 → 2875.98] hearing
[2875.98 → 2876.30] the
[2876.30 → 2876.78] word
[2876.78 → 2877.72] that
[2877.72 → 2878.38] knowledge
[2878.38 → 2878.82] of
[2878.82 → 2879.06] who
[2879.06 → 2879.40] Jesus
[2879.40 → 2879.86] is
[2879.86 → 2879.98] and
[2879.98 → 2880.10] what
[2880.10 → 2880.18] he
[2880.18 → 2880.30] has
[2880.30 → 2880.46] done
[2880.46 → 2880.68] for
[2880.68 → 2880.88] us
[2880.88 → 2881.42] it
[2881.42 → 2882.26] percolates
[2882.26 → 2882.72] down
[2882.72 → 2883.18] into
[2883.18 → 2883.98] my
[2883.98 → 2884.44] heart
[2884.44 → 2885.06] and
[2885.06 → 2885.16] then
[2885.16 → 2885.32] my
[2885.32 → 2885.60] heart
[2885.60 → 2885.76] is
[2885.76 → 2885.98] made
[2885.98 → 2886.64] alive
[2886.64 → 2886.90] to
[2886.90 → 2887.42] respond
[2887.42 → 2887.64] to
[2887.64 → 2887.94] God's
[2887.94 → 2888.26] grace
[2888.26 → 2888.90] I
[2888.90 → 2889.22] begin
[2889.22 → 2889.52] to
[2889.52 → 2890.06] respond
[2890.06 → 2890.26] and
[2890.26 → 2890.78] trust
[2890.78 → 2891.90] and
[2891.90 → 2892.06] in
[2892.06 → 2892.58] belief
[2892.58 → 2893.90] of
[2893.90 → 2894.02] the
[2894.02 → 2894.22] things
[2894.22 → 2894.36] that
[2894.36 → 2894.56] God
[2894.56 → 2894.72] is
[2894.72 → 2895.04] saying
[2895.04 → 2896.58] the
[2896.58 → 2896.80] good
[2896.80 → 2896.98] news
[2896.98 → 2897.08] of
[2897.08 → 2897.18] the
[2897.18 → 2897.48] gospel
[2897.48 → 2897.70] is
[2897.70 → 2897.90] that
[2897.90 → 2898.36] Christ
[2898.36 → 2899.20] died
[2899.20 → 2899.64] for
[2899.64 → 2900.02] sinners
[2900.02 → 2901.38] and
[2901.38 → 2901.52] when
[2901.52 → 2901.72] God
[2901.72 → 2902.02] makes
[2902.02 → 2902.20] me
[2902.20 → 2902.62] alive
[2902.62 → 2902.94] to
[2902.94 → 2903.50] Christ
[2903.50 → 2904.34] in
[2904.34 → 2904.76] Christ
[2904.76 → 2905.58] I
[2905.58 → 2905.98] come
[2905.98 → 2906.14] to
[2906.14 → 2906.28] the
[2906.28 → 2906.68] realization
[2906.68 → 2907.22] that
[2907.22 → 2908.38] I'm
[2908.38 → 2908.52] one
[2908.52 → 2908.60] of
[2908.60 → 2908.80] those
[2908.80 → 2909.10] sinners
[2909.10 → 2909.76] right
[2909.76 → 2910.38] my
[2910.38 → 2910.78] sin
[2910.78 → 2910.94] was
[2910.94 → 2911.22] taken
[2911.22 → 2911.62] away
[2911.62 → 2911.88] and
[2911.88 → 2912.12] I
[2912.12 → 2912.58] believe
[2912.58 → 2913.00] that
[2913.00 → 2913.50] see
[2913.50 → 2913.66] that's
[2913.66 → 2913.76] the
[2913.76 → 2914.12] difference
[2914.12 → 2914.32] you
[2914.32 → 2914.48] can
[2914.48 → 2914.86] know
[2914.86 → 2915.26] Jesus
[2915.26 → 2915.56] died
[2915.56 → 2915.74] for
[2915.74 → 2916.10] sinners
[2916.10 → 2916.96] but
[2916.96 → 2917.38] then
[2917.38 → 2918.74] the
[2918.74 → 2919.02] second
[2919.02 → 2919.36] step
[2919.36 → 2919.64] is
[2919.64 → 2919.94] wow
[2919.94 → 2920.30] Jesus
[2920.30 → 2921.36] actually
[2921.36 → 2921.58] died
[2921.58 → 2921.74] for
[2921.74 → 2922.02] me
[2922.02 → 2923.16] he
[2923.16 → 2923.34] died
[2923.34 → 2923.50] for
[2923.50 → 2923.84] me
[2923.84 → 2925.64] and
[2925.64 → 2925.76] then
[2925.76 → 2925.96] there's
[2925.96 → 2926.12] this
[2926.12 → 2926.40] third
[2926.40 → 2926.78] thing
[2926.78 → 2926.90] and
[2926.90 → 2927.14] that's
[2927.14 → 2927.68] commitment
[2927.68 → 2929.18] actually
[2929.18 → 2930.06] then
[2930.06 → 2930.52] casting
[2930.52 → 2930.82] our
[2930.82 → 2931.20] burdens
[2931.20 → 2931.50] upon
[2931.50 → 2931.74] the
[2931.74 → 2932.00] Lord
[2932.00 → 2932.62] and
[2932.62 → 2932.86] God
[2932.86 → 2933.36] drawing
[2933.36 → 2933.60] us
[2933.60 → 2933.80] to
[2933.80 → 2934.32] himself
[2934.32 → 2935.96] and
[2935.96 → 2936.12] this
[2936.12 → 2936.24] is
[2936.24 → 2936.32] the
[2936.32 → 2936.42] way
[2936.42 → 2936.54] it
[2936.54 → 2936.76] works
[2936.76 → 2936.92] when
[2936.92 → 2937.02] you
[2937.02 → 2937.20] meet
[2937.20 → 2937.50] someone
[2937.50 → 2937.72] who's
[2937.72 → 2938.06] eventually
[2938.06 → 2938.30] going
[2938.30 → 2938.38] to
[2938.38 → 2938.50] be
[2938.50 → 2938.66] your
[2938.66 → 2939.06] spouse
[2939.06 → 2940.18] usually
[2940.18 → 2940.52] first
[2940.52 → 2940.66] you
[2940.66 → 2940.86] hear
[2940.86 → 2941.14] something
[2941.14 → 2941.46] about
[2941.46 → 2941.76] them
[2941.76 → 2942.80] and
[2942.80 → 2942.92] then
[2942.92 → 2943.16] maybe
[2943.16 → 2943.50] there's
[2943.50 → 2943.70] a
[2943.70 → 2943.84] little
[2943.84 → 2944.40] contact
[2944.40 → 2944.60] you
[2944.60 → 2944.74] go
[2944.74 → 2944.86] on
[2944.86 → 2944.98] a
[2944.98 → 2945.22] date
[2945.22 → 2945.52] you
[2945.52 → 2945.82] get
[2945.82 → 2945.94] to
[2945.94 → 2946.08] know
[2946.08 → 2946.24] them
[2946.24 → 2946.36] a
[2946.36 → 2946.44] little
[2946.44 → 2946.58] bit
[2946.58 → 2946.88] better
[2946.88 → 2947.84] but
[2947.84 → 2948.00] then
[2948.00 → 2948.12] what
[2948.12 → 2948.56] happens
[2948.56 → 2949.94] your
[2949.94 → 2950.34] heart
[2950.34 → 2951.58] starts
[2951.58 → 2951.78] to
[2951.78 → 2952.04] beat
[2952.04 → 2952.34] a
[2952.34 → 2952.46] little
[2952.46 → 2952.96] faster
[2952.96 → 2954.10] you
[2954.10 → 2954.54] fall
[2954.54 → 2954.78] in
[2954.78 → 2955.22] love
[2955.22 → 2956.78] and
[2956.78 → 2956.88] then
[2956.88 → 2957.04] these
[2957.04 → 2957.22] two
[2957.22 → 2957.58] people
[2957.58 → 2957.86] say
[2957.86 → 2958.10] well
[2958.10 → 2958.24] you
[2958.24 → 2958.32] know
[2958.32 → 2958.46] what
[2958.46 → 2958.60] we
[2958.60 → 2958.84] know
[2958.84 → 2959.08] each
[2959.08 → 2959.38] other
[2959.38 → 2960.68] we
[2960.68 → 2960.90] feel
[2960.90 → 2961.36] strongly
[2961.36 → 2961.80] about
[2961.80 → 2962.08] each
[2962.08 → 2962.28] other
[2962.28 → 2962.58] let's
[2962.58 → 2963.02] commit
[2963.02 → 2963.54] ourselves
[2963.54 → 2964.06] together
[2964.06 → 2964.84] to
[2964.84 → 2965.06] live
[2965.06 → 2965.24] this
[2965.24 → 2965.60] life
[2965.60 → 2966.84] and
[2966.84 → 2967.02] that's
[2967.02 → 2967.14] what
[2967.14 → 2967.38] true
[2967.38 → 2967.64] faith
[2967.64 → 2968.08] does
[2968.08 → 2968.94] faith
[2968.94 → 2969.22] first
[2969.22 → 2969.58] knows
[2969.58 → 2969.86] about
[2969.86 → 2970.24] God
[2970.24 → 2970.74] and
[2970.74 → 2970.96] then
[2970.96 → 2971.24] that
[2971.24 → 2971.48] faith
[2971.48 → 2972.04] changes
[2972.04 → 2972.36] our
[2972.36 → 2972.80] hearts
[2972.80 → 2973.26] toward
[2973.26 → 2973.80] God
[2973.80 → 2974.22] and
[2974.22 → 2974.32] then
[2974.32 → 2974.44] we
[2974.44 → 2974.64] make
[2974.64 → 2974.82] a
[2974.82 → 2975.34] commitment
[2975.34 → 2975.64] to
[2975.64 → 2976.10] live
[2976.10 → 2976.78] for
[2976.78 → 2977.10] God
[2977.10 → 2977.28] and
[2977.28 → 2977.64] with
[2977.64 → 2978.16] God
[2978.16 → 2979.28] in
[2979.28 → 2979.98] life
[2979.98 → 2981.38] and
[2981.38 → 2981.54] that's
[2981.54 → 2981.68] the way
[2981.68 → 2982.14] the process
[2982.14 → 2982.48] goes
[2982.48 → 2982.62] and
[2982.62 → 2982.72] though
[2982.72 → 2982.84] it
[2982.84 → 2982.96] can
[2982.96 → 2983.20] come
[2983.20 → 2983.32] in
[2983.32 → 2983.50] a
[2983.50 → 2983.74] million
[2983.74 → 2984.14] different
[2984.14 → 2984.62] ways
[2984.62 → 2985.36] that
[2985.36 → 2985.70] too
[2985.70 → 2986.04] friends
[2986.04 → 2986.32] is
[2986.32 → 2986.50] the
[2986.50 → 2986.94] universal
[2986.94 → 2987.68] experience
[2987.68 → 2988.22] of
[2988.22 → 2988.50] all
[2988.50 → 2988.88] Christians
[2988.88 → 2989.14] when
[2989.14 → 2989.48] God
[2989.48 → 2989.90] draws
[2989.90 → 2990.06] us
[2990.06 → 2990.22] to
[2990.22 → 2990.64] himself
[2990.64 → 2991.60] we
[2991.60 → 2991.90] hear
[2991.90 → 2992.10] the
[2992.10 → 2992.54] gospel
[2992.54 → 2993.20] our
[2993.20 → 2993.50] hearts
[2993.50 → 2994.22] respond
[2994.22 → 2994.56] and
[2994.56 → 2994.84] say
[2994.84 → 2995.38] I'm
[2995.38 → 2995.54] a
[2995.54 → 2995.74] sinner
[2995.74 → 2995.90] and
[2995.90 → 2996.12] Christ
[2996.12 → 2996.44] died
[2996.44 → 2996.62] for
[2996.62 → 2996.78] me
[2996.78 → 2997.08] and
[2997.08 → 2997.18] then
[2997.18 → 2997.32] we
[2997.32 → 2997.84] commit
[2997.84 → 2998.40] ourselves
[2998.40 → 2998.96] to
[2998.96 → 2999.28] him
[2999.28 → 3000.60] no
[3000.60 → 3000.80] matter
[3000.80 → 3001.06] who
[3001.06 → 3001.28] you
[3001.28 → 3001.58] are
[3001.58 → 3001.86] where
[3001.86 → 3002.06] you
[3002.06 → 3002.34] come
[3002.34 → 3002.72] from
[3002.72 → 3003.08] and
[3003.08 → 3003.44] whatever
[3003.44 → 3003.90] age
[3003.90 → 3004.16] that
[3004.16 → 3004.58] is
[3004.58 → 3005.16] the
[3005.16 → 3005.80] experience
[3005.80 → 3006.12] of
[3006.12 → 3006.28] all
[3006.28 → 3006.68] Christians
[3006.68 → 3009.04] and
[3009.04 → 3009.16] that
[3009.16 → 3009.36] leads
[3009.36 → 3009.48] us
[3009.48 → 3009.60] to
[3009.60 → 3009.72] the
[3009.72 → 3009.92] last
[3009.92 → 3010.18] point
[3010.18 → 3010.36] this
[3010.36 → 3010.64] morning
[3010.64 → 3011.02] how
[3011.02 → 3011.32] then
[3011.32 → 3011.60] does
[3011.60 → 3011.96] God
[3011.96 → 3012.54] not
[3012.54 → 3012.86] save
[3012.86 → 3013.20] us
[3013.20 → 3014.14] well
[3014.14 → 3014.38] he
[3014.38 → 3014.60] does
[3014.60 → 3014.88] not
[3014.88 → 3015.16] save
[3015.16 → 3015.30] us
[3015.30 → 3015.44] by
[3015.44 → 3015.64] what
[3015.64 → 3015.78] it
[3015.78 → 3016.14] says
[3016.14 → 3016.44] right
[3016.44 → 3016.68] here
[3016.68 → 3016.80] in
[3016.80 → 3016.92] our
[3016.92 → 3017.38] passage
[3017.38 → 3018.34] for
[3018.34 → 3018.42] it
[3018.42 → 3018.50] is
[3018.50 → 3018.64] by
[3018.64 → 3018.94] grace
[3018.94 → 3019.08] you
[3019.08 → 3019.20] have
[3019.20 → 3019.36] been
[3019.36 → 3019.86] saved
[3019.86 → 3020.42] through
[3020.42 → 3020.94] faith
[3020.94 → 3021.36] and
[3021.36 → 3021.52] this
[3021.52 → 3021.66] is
[3021.66 → 3021.84] not
[3021.84 → 3022.04] from
[3022.04 → 3022.46] yourselves
[3022.46 → 3023.10] it's
[3023.10 → 3023.24] the
[3023.24 → 3023.42] gift
[3023.42 → 3023.58] of
[3023.58 → 3023.82] God
[3023.82 → 3024.26] not
[3024.26 → 3024.76] by
[3024.76 → 3025.20] works
[3025.20 → 3026.14] so
[3026.14 → 3026.26] that
[3026.26 → 3026.40] no
[3026.40 → 3026.52] one
[3026.52 → 3026.68] can
[3026.68 → 3026.94] boast
[3026.94 → 3027.22] there's
[3027.22 → 3027.40] no
[3027.40 → 3027.78] boasting
[3027.78 → 3029.78] and
[3029.78 → 3030.02] not
[3030.02 → 3030.28] being
[3030.28 → 3030.58] saved
[3030.58 → 3030.76] by
[3030.76 → 3031.20] works
[3031.20 → 3031.74] also
[3031.74 → 3032.62] precludes
[3032.62 → 3033.86] faith
[3033.86 → 3035.94] right
[3035.94 → 3036.82] in
[3036.82 → 3037.04] other
[3037.04 → 3037.34] words
[3037.34 → 3038.16] your
[3038.16 → 3038.88] believing
[3038.88 → 3039.66] in
[3039.66 → 3039.96] Jesus
[3039.96 → 3040.26] was
[3040.26 → 3040.60] not
[3040.60 → 3040.80] the
[3040.80 → 3041.00] good
[3041.00 → 3041.34] work
[3041.34 → 3041.54] that
[3041.54 → 3041.82] brought
[3041.82 → 3042.02] you
[3042.02 → 3042.20] into
[3042.20 → 3042.38] the
[3042.38 → 3042.64] kingdom
[3042.64 → 3043.84] so
[3043.84 → 3043.98] if
[3043.98 → 3044.20] someone
[3044.20 → 3044.52] says
[3044.52 → 3044.68] to
[3044.68 → 3044.98] you
[3044.98 → 3046.36] how
[3046.36 → 3046.90] are
[3046.90 → 3047.16] you
[3047.16 → 3047.70] saved
[3047.70 → 3048.72] and
[3048.72 → 3048.88] you
[3048.88 → 3049.50] respond
[3049.50 → 3050.16] because
[3050.16 → 3050.32] I
[3050.32 → 3050.60] believe
[3050.60 → 3050.78] in
[3050.78 → 3051.10] Jesus
[3051.10 → 3052.30] that's
[3052.30 → 3052.42] the
[3052.42 → 3052.62] wrong
[3052.62 → 3052.98] answer
[3052.98 → 3053.58] right
[3053.58 → 3053.74] the
[3053.74 → 3054.02] right
[3054.02 → 3054.34] answer
[3054.34 → 3054.62] is
[3054.62 → 3055.34] because
[3055.34 → 3055.74] Jesus
[3055.74 → 3056.16] died
[3056.16 → 3056.34] for
[3056.34 → 3056.44] me
[3056.44 → 3056.54] on
[3056.54 → 3056.66] the
[3056.66 → 3056.92] cross
[3056.92 → 3057.10] and
[3057.10 → 3057.36] gave
[3057.36 → 3057.52] me
[3057.52 → 3057.64] a
[3057.64 → 3057.78] new
[3057.78 → 3058.24] life
[3058.24 → 3059.16] and
[3059.16 → 3059.26] he
[3059.26 → 3059.52] also
[3059.52 → 3059.84] gave
[3059.84 → 3060.04] me
[3060.04 → 3060.70] faith
[3060.70 → 3060.92] and
[3060.92 → 3061.22] that's
[3061.22 → 3061.58] how
[3061.58 → 3061.80] and
[3061.80 → 3062.24] why
[3062.24 → 3062.74] I
[3062.74 → 3062.90] can
[3062.90 → 3063.14] believe
[3063.14 → 3063.30] in
[3063.30 → 3063.52] him
[3063.52 → 3064.96] right
[3064.96 → 3065.28] there's
[3065.28 → 3065.68] nothing
[3065.68 → 3066.04] you
[3066.04 → 3066.24] can
[3066.24 → 3066.50] do
[3066.50 → 3066.78] think
[3066.78 → 3066.96] or
[3066.96 → 3067.18] say
[3067.18 → 3067.40] that
[3067.40 → 3068.04] counts
[3068.04 → 3068.54] in
[3068.54 → 3068.72] the
[3068.72 → 3069.30] asset
[3069.30 → 3070.08] column
[3070.08 → 3070.98] in
[3070.98 → 3071.30] heaven
[3071.30 → 3073.02] the
[3073.02 → 3073.34] apostle
[3073.34 → 3073.70] Paul
[3073.70 → 3074.10] talks
[3074.10 → 3074.32] about
[3074.32 → 3074.68] himself
[3074.68 → 3074.98] in
[3074.98 → 3075.12] the
[3075.12 → 3075.28] same
[3077.70 → 3078.22] this
[3078.22 → 3078.36] is
[3078.36 → 3078.52] how
[3078.52 → 3078.72] I
[3078.72 → 3079.06] used
[3079.06 → 3079.26] to
[3079.26 → 3079.44] view
[3079.44 → 3079.66] my
[3079.66 → 3079.96] life
[3079.96 → 3080.10] I
[3080.10 → 3080.30] had
[3080.30 → 3080.46] this
[3080.46 → 3080.92] asset
[3080.92 → 3081.36] column
[3081.36 → 3081.76] and
[3081.76 → 3081.88] I
[3081.88 → 3082.04] had
[3082.04 → 3082.16] a
[3082.16 → 3082.54] liability
[3082.54 → 3083.12] column
[3083.12 → 3083.56] I
[3083.56 → 3083.82] had
[3083.82 → 3084.36] nothing
[3084.36 → 3084.56] in
[3084.56 → 3084.74] my
[3084.74 → 3085.22] liability
[3085.22 → 3085.56] column
[3085.56 → 3085.74] I
[3085.74 → 3085.88] was
[3085.88 → 3086.08] pretty
[3086.08 → 3086.48] awesome
[3086.48 → 3087.64] and
[3087.64 → 3087.76] I
[3087.76 → 3088.00] had
[3088.00 → 3088.18] this
[3088.18 → 3089.02] long
[3089.02 → 3089.78] long
[3089.78 → 3090.26] list
[3090.26 → 3090.64] of
[3090.64 → 3091.18] assets
[3091.18 → 3092.20] so
[3092.20 → 3092.32] this
[3092.32 → 3092.42] is
[3092.42 → 3092.52] what
[3092.52 → 3092.62] he
[3092.62 → 3092.88] says
[3092.88 → 3093.00] in
[3093.00 → 3093.08] the
[3093.08 → 3093.22] book
[3093.22 → 3093.34] of
[3093.34 → 3093.88] Philippians
[3093.88 → 3099.92] he
[3099.92 → 3100.36] says
[3100.36 → 3101.72] these
[3101.72 → 3101.88] were
[3101.88 → 3102.06] his
[3102.06 → 3102.48] assets
[3102.48 → 3103.68] circumcised
[3103.68 → 3103.88] on
[3103.88 → 3104.02] the

[3104.22 → 3104.50] day
[3104.50 → 3105.30] of
[3105.30 → 3105.46] the

[3105.78 → 3105.98] of
[3105.98 → 3106.40] Israel
[3106.40 → 3107.02] of
[3107.02 → 3107.18] the

[3108.86 → 3109.14] of
[3109.14 → 3109.58] Hebrews
[3109.58 → 3110.70] in
[3110.70 → 3111.04] regard
[3111.04 → 3111.22] to
[3111.22 → 3111.38] the
[3111.38 → 3111.68] law
[3111.68 → 3112.06] of
[3112.06 → 3112.68] Pharisee
[3112.68 → 3113.54] as
[3113.54 → 3113.70] for
[3113.70 → 3114.08] zeal
[3114.08 → 3115.08] persecuting
[3115.08 → 3115.24] the
[3115.24 → 3115.64] church
[3115.64 → 3116.32] as
[3116.32 → 3116.50] for
[3116.50 → 3116.94] righteousness
[3116.94 → 3117.44] based
[3117.44 → 3117.56] on
[3117.56 → 3117.68] the
[3117.68 → 3118.00] law
[3118.00 → 3119.38] faultless
[3119.38 → 3122.88] he
[3122.88 → 3123.18] says
[3123.18 → 3123.54] this
[3123.54 → 3123.72] is
[3123.72 → 3123.92] what
[3123.92 → 3124.12] I
[3124.12 → 3124.78] thought
[3124.78 → 3125.24] my
[3125.24 → 3125.66] asset
[3125.66 → 3126.08] column
[3126.08 → 3126.64] was
[3126.64 → 3127.82] but
[3127.82 → 3128.02] then
[3128.02 → 3128.18] I
[3128.18 → 3128.38] came
[3128.38 → 3128.64] to
[3128.64 → 3129.08] know
[3129.08 → 3129.60] Christ
[3129.60 → 3129.74] and
[3129.74 → 3129.80] I
[3129.80 → 3130.20] looked
[3130.20 → 3130.38] at
[3130.38 → 3130.58] this
[3130.58 → 3130.94] asset
[3130.94 → 3131.30] column
[3131.30 → 3131.42] and
[3131.42 → 3131.54] I
[3131.54 → 3131.80] saw
[3131.80 → 3132.62] these
[3132.62 → 3132.80] are
[3132.80 → 3133.14] all
[3133.14 → 3133.90] liabilities
[3133.90 → 3134.38] these
[3134.38 → 3134.48] are
[3134.48 → 3134.68] not
[3134.68 → 3135.14] assets
[3135.14 → 3135.34] they
[3135.34 → 3135.42] are
[3135.42 → 3136.02] liabilities
[3136.02 → 3137.98] and
[3137.98 → 3138.30] now
[3138.30 → 3138.64] over
[3138.64 → 3138.86] in
[3138.86 → 3139.06] my
[3139.06 → 3139.44] asset
[3139.44 → 3139.92] column
[3139.92 → 3140.42] there
[3140.42 → 3140.66] is
[3140.66 → 3140.90] only
[3140.90 → 3141.32] one
[3141.32 → 3141.74] name
[3141.74 → 3142.36] Jesus
[3142.36 → 3142.80] Christ
[3142.80 → 3143.60] that's
[3143.60 → 3143.80] it
[3143.80 → 3145.26] so
[3145.26 → 3145.52] this
[3145.52 → 3145.62] is
[3145.62 → 3145.72] what
[3145.72 → 3145.84] he
[3145.84 → 3146.20] continues
[3146.20 → 3146.44] to
[3146.44 → 3146.68] say
[3146.68 → 3147.10] you
[3147.10 → 3147.18] can
[3147.18 → 3147.36] put it
[3147.36 → 3147.54] back
[3147.54 → 3147.68] up
[3147.68 → 3147.92] there
[3147.92 → 3148.68] but
[3148.68 → 3149.24] whatever
[3149.24 → 3149.26] whatever
[3149.26 → 3149.58] were
[3149.58 → 3149.88] gains
[3149.88 → 3150.02] to
[3150.02 → 3150.16] me
[3150.16 → 3150.34] I
[3150.34 → 3150.58] now
[3150.58 → 3151.04] consider
[3151.04 → 3151.52] loss
[3151.52 → 3151.78] for the
[3151.78 → 3151.96] sake
[3151.96 → 3152.14] of
[3152.14 → 3152.46] Christ
[3152.46 → 3153.04] I
[3153.04 → 3153.48] consider
[3153.48 → 3153.90] them
[3153.90 → 3154.78] garbage
[3154.78 → 3155.22] that
[3155.22 → 3155.38] I
[3155.38 → 3155.56] may
[3155.56 → 3155.96] gain
[3155.96 → 3156.32] Christ
[3156.32 → 3156.44] and
[3156.44 → 3156.56] be
[3156.56 → 3156.78] found
[3156.78 → 3157.08] in
[3157.08 → 3157.30] him
[3157.30 → 3157.52] not
[3157.52 → 3157.82] having
[3157.82 → 3158.02] a
[3158.02 → 3158.40] righteousness
[3158.40 → 3158.66] of
[3158.66 → 3158.82] my
[3158.82 → 3159.06] own

[3159.22 → 3159.46] comes
[3159.46 → 3159.70] from
[3159.70 → 3159.86] the
[3159.86 → 3160.10] law
[3160.10 → 3160.64] but
[3160.64 → 3160.86] that
[3160.86 → 3161.12] which
[3161.12 → 3161.38] is
[3161.38 → 3162.40] through

[3338.86 → 3339.02] I
[3339.02 → 3339.30] cling
[3339.30 → 3341.16] you
[3341.16 → 3341.46] don't
[3341.46 → 3341.66] have
[3341.66 → 3341.94] anything
[3341.94 → 3342.26] to offer
[3342.26 → 3342.62] God
[3342.62 → 3343.42] you just
[3343.42 → 3343.60] have
[3343.60 → 3344.04] Christ
[3344.04 → 3346.12] how do you
[3346.12 → 3347.14] know you're going to go to heaven
[3347.14 → 3348.52] it's not because you believed
[3348.52 → 3350.46] it's because Christ
[3350.46 → 3351.30] loved you
[3351.30 → 3351.84] and died
[3351.84 → 3352.60] for you
[3352.60 → 3353.70] and friends
[3353.70 → 3354.76] that is the universal
[3354.76 → 3355.60] experience
[3355.60 → 3356.72] of grace
[3356.72 → 3358.10] it's the experience
[3358.10 → 3359.48] that we all share
[3359.48 → 3360.86] and that friends
[3360.86 → 3361.86] is the basis
[3361.86 → 3363.24] of our
[3363.24 → 3363.98] life
[3363.98 → 3364.58] together
[3364.58 → 3365.44] wherever
[3365.44 → 3366.66] we come from
[3366.66 → 3367.86] whatever experience
[3367.86 → 3368.70] we don't come and judge
[3368.70 → 3369.70] other people's experience
[3369.70 → 3371.04] we all come
[3371.04 → 3372.50] experiencing God's grace
[3372.50 → 3374.02] we all come
[3374.02 → 3375.30] having been
[3375.30 → 3376.44] given this heart
[3376.44 → 3377.14] of faith
[3377.14 → 3378.98] even in our doubts
[3378.98 → 3379.50] and our weakness
[3379.50 → 3380.46] where we just hold on
[3380.46 → 3381.00] to Christ
[3381.00 → 3383.02] and we experience
[3383.02 → 3383.50] the fact that
[3383.50 → 3384.00] we bring
[3384.00 → 3384.74] nothing
[3384.74 → 3386.58] the richest
[3386.58 → 3387.60] the poorest
[3387.60 → 3388.80] the good
[3388.80 → 3389.98] the bad
[3389.98 → 3390.92] we bring nothing
[3390.92 → 3391.68] but Christ
[3391.68 → 3392.82] died for us
[3392.82 → 3394.54] and because
[3394.54 → 3395.28] of that one thing
[3395.28 → 3395.72] it doesn't matter
[3395.72 → 3396.34] who we are
[3396.34 → 3397.26] where we come from
[3397.26 → 3398.78] we are the family
[3398.78 → 3399.52] of God together
[3399.52 → 3400.44] because
[3400.44 → 3401.60] we've experienced
[3401.60 → 3402.58] the grace of God together
[3402.58 → 3403.70] okay
[3403.70 → 3404.98] let me pray for us
[3404.98 → 3408.24] Heavenly Father
[3408.24 → 3408.62] we
[3408.62 → 3410.00] we praise you
[3410.00 → 3410.26] God
[3410.26 → 3410.88] you are worthy
[3410.88 → 3411.86] of all of our praise
[3411.86 → 3413.78] you are the one
[3413.78 → 3414.42] who loved us
[3414.42 → 3415.38] when we were unloveable
[3415.38 → 3417.96] who had mercy on us
[3417.96 → 3418.68] when we were not
[3418.68 → 3419.64] deserving of mercy
[3419.64 → 3420.78] who made a home
[3420.78 → 3421.20] for us
[3421.20 → 3422.18] when we were homeless
[3422.18 → 3423.88] who forgave us
[3423.88 → 3424.98] when we were unforgiving
[3424.98 → 3427.28] so Lord
[3427.28 → 3428.46] we just thank you
[3428.46 → 3429.98] and Lord
[3429.98 → 3431.10] I pray that
[3431.10 → 3431.86] each one of us
[3431.86 → 3432.32] this morning
[3432.32 → 3432.58] Lord
[3432.58 → 3433.46] we would just have
[3433.46 → 3436.02] if we know you
[3436.02 → 3436.80] we would remember
[3436.80 → 3437.56] the joy
[3437.56 → 3439.32] of knowing you
[3439.32 → 3441.36] and when we first
[3441.36 → 3442.78] confess that
[3442.78 → 3443.52] we were sinners
[3443.52 → 3445.02] and that we needed
[3445.02 → 3445.48] a saviour
[3445.48 → 3446.12] Father
[3446.12 → 3446.72] and if there are
[3446.72 → 3447.52] any here today
[3447.52 → 3448.42] who do not yet
[3448.42 → 3448.88] know you
[3448.88 → 3449.48] in this way
[3449.48 → 3450.42] Lord
[3450.42 → 3450.92] I pray
[3450.92 → 3452.30] that they would not
[3452.30 → 3452.98] leave here
[3452.98 → 3454.54] until you have
[3454.54 → 3455.88] warmed their hearts
[3455.88 → 3457.30] they have given them
[3457.30 → 3458.24] ears to hear
[3458.24 → 3459.24] eyes to see
[3459.24 → 3460.44] their sin
[3460.44 → 3461.84] and your
[3461.84 → 3462.78] great grace
[3462.78 → 3463.24] to them
[3463.24 → 3464.78] I pray
[3464.78 → 3466.14] in Jesus name
[3466.14 → 3466.80] Amen
[3466.80 → 3469.68] so let's stand
[3469.68 → 3470.44] we'll invite the worship team
[3470.44 → 3470.84] back up
[3470.84 → 3471.34] and we'll sing
[3471.34 → 3472.36] our song of response
[3472.36 → 3486.86] amazing grace
[3486.86 → 3500.84] amazing grace
[3500.84 → 3503.60] how sweet the sound
[3503.60 → 3510.00] that saved a wretch like me
[3510.00 → 3513.38] I once was lost
[3513.38 → 3516.46] but now I'm found
[3516.46 → 3518.60] was blind
[3518.60 → 3521.60] but now I see
[3521.60 → 3526.72] grace that taught
[3526.72 → 3529.44] my heart to fear
[3529.44 → 3534.38] and grace my fears relieved
[3534.38 → 3539.30] a precious day
[3539.30 → 3542.40] that grace appeared
[3542.40 → 3547.38] the hour I first believed
[3547.38 → 3551.66] my chains are gone
[3551.66 → 3554.06] my sins set free
[3554.06 → 3557.46] my God my Saviour
[3557.46 → 3560.84] has ransomed me
[3560.84 → 3563.96] and like a flood
[3563.96 → 3568.00] His mercy rains
[3568.00 → 3571.36] unending love
[3571.36 → 3573.84] amazing grace
[3573.84 → 3574.96] His mercy rains
[3574.96 → 3586.22] the Lord
[3586.22 → 3587.90] has promised
[3587.90 → 3591.34] good to me
[3591.34 → 3592.90] His word
[3592.90 → 3594.78] my hope
[3594.78 → 3595.86] secures
[3595.86 → 3598.90] He will
[3599.58 → 3601.50] my shield
[3601.50 → 3603.20] and fortune
[3603.20 → 3610.20] As long as life endures
[3611.02 → 3617.34] Many dangers, toils, and snares
[3617.34 → 3622.20] I have already come
[3623.64 → 3630.20] This grace have brought me safe thus far
[3630.20 → 3635.20] And grace will lead me home
[3636.02 → 3641.70] My chains are gone, I've been set free
[3641.70 → 3648.20] My God, my Saviour, has ransomed me
[3648.90 → 3655.20] And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[3655.20 → 3661.20] Unending love, amazing grace
[3661.20 → 3678.70] When we've been there ten thousand years
[3678.70 → 3684.70] Bright shining as the sun
[3684.70 → 3692.70] We've no fewer days to sing God's praise
[3692.70 → 3697.70] Than when we have first begun
[3697.70 → 3714.60] So as recipients of God's amazing and abundant grace, we now offer our gifts to God.
[3714.60 → 3720.42] Our designated offering for this Sunday is the Vancouver Short-Term Mission Training Centre
[3720.42 → 3728.10] This is an organization locally here that trains churches and organizations to really just share the gospel
[3728.10 → 3732.60] And so we're especially partnering with them in terms of our Chinese ministry
[3732.60 → 3737.60] Because they have come alongside Pastor Nancy and have done some training with their group
[3737.60 → 3740.60] And so we want to, we value this relationship with them
[3740.60 → 3741.60] We want to support them
[3741.60 → 3743.60] And they're excited about what we're doing here
[3743.60 → 3748.60] So we'll invite the deacons to come forward and collect our morning offering
[3748.60 → 3750.60] Thank you
[3778.60 → 3780.60] Thank you
[3808.60 → 3810.60] Thank you
[3838.60 → 3840.60] Thank you
[3840.60 → 3841.60] Thank you
[3841.60 → 3843.60] Thank you
[3843.60 → 3845.60] Thank you
[3845.60 → 3854.60] So let's come now together in a community prayer, praying for our church and the world
[3854.60 → 3859.60] And as we go through, sometimes I think this is helpful where I will lead us in prayer
[3859.60 → 3862.60] And then we'll stop, and I'll say, Lord in your mercy
[3862.60 → 3865.60] And you can respond, hear our prayer
[3865.60 → 3866.60] Okay, so we'll do that a couple of times
[3866.60 → 3868.60] So please join me in prayer
[3868.60 → 3869.60] Let's pray together
[3869.60 → 3873.60] Heavenly Father, your compassions fail not
[3873.60 → 3875.60] They are new every morning
[3875.60 → 3880.60] They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[3880.60 → 3883.60] They shall mount up with wings as eagles
[3883.60 → 3885.60] They shall run and not be weary
[3885.60 → 3887.60] They shall walk and not faint
[3887.60 → 3889.60] Therefore we pray
[3889.60 → 3891.60] Father renew us
[3891.60 → 3894.60] Renew our spirits within us
[3894.60 → 3897.60] Renew our relationships
[3897.60 → 3898.60] Our work
[3898.60 → 3900.60] Our retirement
[3900.60 → 3903.60] Our capacities and our gifts
[3903.60 → 3905.60] Our strength
[3905.60 → 3907.60] Renew our prayer
[3907.60 → 3909.60] Renew our faith
[3909.60 → 3917.60] That we may put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness
[3917.60 → 3919.60] Lord in your mercy
[3919.60 → 3920.60] Lord in your mercy
[3920.60 → 3921.60] Hear our prayer
[3923.60 → 3926.60] Our Father we are so grateful for your presence in our life
[3926.60 → 3930.60] We're thankful that you are not a God who is far off
[3930.60 → 3935.60] But that you are a God who draws near to us
[3935.60 → 3938.60] Who enters into the mess of our world
[3938.60 → 3941.60] Into the mess of our own hearts
[3941.60 → 3943.60] And who walks with us
[3944.60 → 3946.60] In grace and in mercy
[3946.60 → 3948.60] Lord we thank you for your presence
[3948.60 → 3951.60] And we invite your presence not just into our spiritual lives
[3951.60 → 3952.60] Which we do
[3952.60 → 3955.60] But into the messy lives of our homes
[3956.60 → 3958.60] And our workplaces
[3958.60 → 3959.60] Our relationships
[3959.60 → 3961.60] Every private area of our lives
[3962.60 → 3964.60] Show us what you want us
[3964.60 → 3966.60] To leave behind
[3967.60 → 3969.60] Show us what you want us to take up
[3971.60 → 3976.60] Help us to live as your holy people saved by your abundant grace in Christ
[3977.60 → 3978.60] Lord in your mercy
[3979.60 → 3984.60] God you are our strong deliverer
[3984.60 → 3989.60] May your righteousness and rule extend to every corner of the world
[3990.60 → 3993.60] Especially where there is violence and suffering
[3994.60 → 3997.60] We continue to pray for the nation of Ukraine
[3998.60 → 3999.60] We pray for the end of war
[4000.60 → 4002.60] We pray for the many believers there
[4002.60 → 4004.60] Who are seeking to reflect your presence
[4005.60 → 4006.60] And care for the suffering
[4007.60 → 4009.60] Lord bring peace and justice
[4010.60 → 4012.60] To our violent and suffering world
[4012.60 → 4014.60] Lord in your mercy
[4015.60 → 4016.60] Hear our prayer
[4017.60 → 4018.60] And Father we come before you
[4019.60 → 4022.60] Lifting our own congregation
[4023.60 → 4024.60] Lord the people, brothers and sisters
[4025.60 → 4027.60] Whom you have brought together to be one family in Christ
[4028.60 → 4030.60] Father we pray for Pastor Nancy
[4031.60 → 4033.60] As next week she invites a whole group of kids
[4034.60 → 4037.60] Together with her volunteers to share the gospel
[4038.60 → 4040.60] Lord we pray for families and children
[4040.60 → 4042.60] Lord to come to know God
[4043.60 → 4045.60] In Christ and Lord to become part of our church
[4046.60 → 4051.60] We pray also, and thank you, Lord, for the good news
[4052.60 → 4054.60] That young Richie the grandson of
[4055.60 → 4056.60] Of Rick

[4062.60 → 4064.60] That you've been at work
[4064.60 → 4065.60] Lord you've been at work
[4066.60 → 4067.60] But Lord there's still healing to be done
[4068.60 → 4070.60] We ask that you would continue to heal him
[4070.60 → 4073.60] But Lord we do give you thanks for the healing that he has experienced
[4074.60 → 4075.60] Lord would you bring him to full health
[4076.60 → 4079.60] We thank you that Janet is out of the hospital
[4080.60 → 4081.60] She is back at home
[4081.60 → 4082.60] We pray that she would be able to stay there
[4083.60 → 4087.60] That you would help her not to have any further health complications
[4087.60 → 4090.60] Lord we thank you for these answers to prayer
[4091.60 → 4092.60] That you have given us
[4093.60 → 4097.60] But Lord we also remember those who are in care homes
[4098.60 → 4099.60] And who still have declining health

[4102.60 → 4104.60] And their ongoing health issues

[4114.60 → 4118.60] And now Lord gathering our prayers into one we pray
[4119.60 → 4122.60] The Lord's prayer as Jesus taught us
[4123.60 → 4124.60] Saying
[4125.60 → 4126.60] Our Father who art in heaven
[4127.60 → 4128.60] Hallowed be thy name
[4129.60 → 4130.60] Thy kingdom come
[4131.60 → 4132.60] Thy will be done
[4133.60 → 4134.60] On earth as it is in heaven
[4135.60 → 4137.60] Give us this day our daily bread
[4138.60 → 4139.60] And forgive us our debts
[4140.60 → 4141.60] As we forgive our debtors
[4142.60 → 4143.60] And lead us not into temptation
[4144.60 → 4146.60] But deliver us from evil
[4147.60 → 4148.60] For thine is the kingdom
[4148.60 → 4149.60] And the power
[4149.60 → 4150.60] And the glory forever
[4151.60 → 4152.60] Amen
[4153.60 → 4154.60] Brothers and sisters please rise
[4155.60 → 4158.60] And we go from here with the Lord's blessing upon us
[4159.60 → 4161.60] May the Lord bless you
[4162.60 → 4163.60] And keep you
[4163.60 → 4164.60] The Lord to make his face to shine upon you
[4165.60 → 4166.60] And be gracious to you
[4167.60 → 4168.60] The Lord lift his countenance upon you
[4169.60 → 4170.60] And give you peace
[4170.60 → 4171.60] Amen
[4174.60 → 4175.60] We receive your blessing

[4177.60 → 4178.60] We receive your blessing
[4178.60 → 4180.60] We receive your grace
[4181.60 → 4183.60] As we walk in the light shining from your face
[4184.60 → 4185.60] May the peace that you give
[4185.60 → 4186.60] Change the way that we live
[4186.60 → 4187.60] We receive your blessing as we leave this place
[4188.60 → 4189.60] We receive your blessing as we leave this place
