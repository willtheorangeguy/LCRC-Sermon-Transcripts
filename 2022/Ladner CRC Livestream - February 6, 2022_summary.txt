• Praying "your will be done" means asking God to advance His kingdom and restore all things to what He intended at creation
• What does it mean for God's will to be done, and how would it look if God answered this prayer tomorrow?
• God's will is divided into two categories: the decorative (or sovereign) will and the preceptive will.
• The decorative will refers to God's purposes and plans that he enacts with power and authority.
• Examples of God's decorative will include creation (e.g. "let there be light") and salvation (Ephesians 1:5).
• In contrast, humans do not have the ability to declare something and have it immediately happen.
• God's will is fulfilled in two senses: decorative (God's plan and purposes) and prescriptive (God's desire for us to obey him)
• The Apostle Paul talks about God's prescriptive will in Romans 12, emphasizing the need to live in worship of God and obedience to Him
• God's prescriptive will is our response to His saving us, involving living a life of humble obedience to Him
• We can refuse God's commandments, unlike nature which cannot refuse God's light
• When praying "your will be done", we are asking God to shape our wills and bend them to what pleases Him.

• The leper is immediately healed, both physically and relationally
• This encounter demonstrates Jesus' compassion and willingness to touch those who are unclean
• Jesus heals a man and tells him not to tell anyone
• The man disobeys Jesus' command and spreads the news, causing Jesus to be mobbed by crowds in towns
• The man's disobedience prevents Jesus from entering towns openly

• The paradox of praying "your will be done", where God alone can do His will, but we pledge ourselves to make it our ultimate concern
• The connection between praying for God's will and taking action in the world, including sharing the gospel and pursuing justice and equity
• God's will starts with individuals, who pray for it to be done in their hearts
• Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane is an example of praying for God's will
