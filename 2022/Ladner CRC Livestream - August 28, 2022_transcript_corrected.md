[421.64 → 425.64] Well, good morning, beloved Lanner CRC.
[425.64 → 427.64] We're so glad you're here.
[427.64 → 428.64] My name is Jason True.
[428.64 → 433.64] I'm the lead pastor here, and I will be leading us in worship this morning.
[433.64 → 438.64] If you are a visitor this morning, let me also extend a warm welcome to you.
[438.64 → 440.64] We are glad that you are here with us today.
[440.64 → 445.64] And there's no better place to be than to be gathered with God's people and worshipping him together.
[446.64 → 449.64] So just a few announcements before we get started.
[449.64 → 450.64] Today is a special day.
[450.64 → 453.64] It is Ted's 97th birthday.
[460.64 → 465.64] And so to help him celebrate, we are all invited after the worship service.
[465.64 → 468.64] In the fellowship hall, we're going to have cake to go with our coffee.
[468.64 → 469.64] So it's a good day.
[470.64 → 475.64] Also today, so after cake and coffee, we will be having some baptisms.
[475.64 → 482.64] We're not going to be having them here in our worship service, but we will be going to Martin and Ann Hamming's farm.
[482.64 → 485.64] They very graciously are hosting us.
[485.64 → 487.64] And it's open to anybody who wants to go.
[487.64 → 491.64] So there are seven men and women from our Chinese ministry.
[491.64 → 494.64] And so we will be baptizing them in the pool.
[494.64 → 495.64] It will be fun.
[495.64 → 497.64] Pastor Nancy bought me a white robe.
[497.64 → 499.64] I've never worn a white robe.
[499.64 → 501.64] I feel very self-conscious about it.
[501.64 → 503.64] But all things for the sake of the gospel.
[503.64 → 506.64] See how that goes.
[506.64 → 509.64] So everyone can come.
[509.64 → 515.64] And another thing is today is Hannah Lao's last day with us.
[515.64 → 522.64] She has been serving with us as our children's ministry director or coordinator.
[522.64 → 524.64] And she has done an amazing job.
[524.64 → 533.64] She has come in, and she has helped us to get things organized and to give some leadership and direction to the children's ministry.
[533.64 → 540.64] And of course we still have all of our teachers, our assistants who work to lead our children.
[540.64 → 546.64] And there have been many people who have served faithfully in this role over the many years.
[546.64 → 548.64] Some of you are here.
[548.64 → 553.64] And today we do want to recognize Hannah and thank her for her work among us.
[553.64 → 554.64] So I want to invite her up.
[554.64 → 555.64] And we have a small gift.
[555.64 → 583.64] And that being said, so we're very much thankful for this.
[583.64 → 586.64] Hannah for your work.
[586.64 → 589.64] We are looking for a new children's coordinator.
[589.64 → 592.64] Any volunteers?
[592.64 → 595.64] There is an announcement in the bulletin.
[595.64 → 598.64] And honestly this could be a volunteer position.
[598.64 → 599.64] Maybe one of you wants to serve.
[599.64 → 601.64] We're thinking it's probably like eight to ten hours a week.
[601.64 → 604.64] But we're also willing to make it a paid position.
[604.64 → 605.64] And there is a budget for it.
[605.64 → 609.64] So if any of you still want to do it, anyone might be paid.
[609.64 → 611.64] That's absolutely a possibility.
[611.64 → 614.64] Or if you just know of anybody, we don't mind stealing from other churches.
[614.64 → 616.64] Whoever, you know.
[616.64 → 618.64] So we are looking for that.
[618.64 → 621.64] Please do keep that as a prayer in mind.
[621.64 → 623.64] A new children's ministry coordinator.
[623.64 → 627.64] So let's begin our worship service this morning.
[627.64 → 634.64] As we start into the worship, the first word in worship is always God's word.
[634.64 → 639.64] Because he is the one who calls us into his presence.
[639.64 → 644.64] He is the one who greets us by his love and his grace.
[644.64 → 648.64] So our call to worship, we'll have it here up on the screen.
[648.64 → 653.64] And where it has the two arrows, I invite you to say it along with me.
[653.64 → 658.64] We have gathered to worship the true and living God.
[658.64 → 663.64] As he has revealed himself most fully in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[663.64 → 667.64] He is our refuge and our fortress.
[667.64 → 670.64] Our God in whom we trust.
[670.64 → 674.64] Let us confess with our mouths, Jesus is Lord.
[674.64 → 678.64] And believe in our hearts that God raised him from the dead.
[678.64 → 683.64] For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.
[683.64 → 687.64] With all the saints throughout history, we say,
[687.64 → 690.64] Worthy is the lamb who was slain.
[690.64 → 698.64] To receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise.
[698.64 → 702.64] Let us call upon our one true Lord and God.
[702.64 → 705.64] Believing him in our hearts.
[705.64 → 707.64] Confessing him with our mouths.
[707.64 → 711.64] And worshipping him in spirit and in truth.
[711.64 → 717.64] Would you please join me now as we come before the Lord, this God, in prayer.
[717.64 → 719.64] In a prayer of adoration.
[719.64 → 722.64] Let's join our hearts in prayer.
[722.64 → 726.64] Holy Father, desire of the nations.
[726.64 → 730.64] Because your loving kindness is better than life.
[730.64 → 733.64] Our lips are meant to praise you.
[733.64 → 736.64] You are the redeemer of our souls.
[736.64 → 738.64] The renewer of our hearts.
[738.64 → 740.64] The restorer of our hopes.
[740.64 → 743.64] You make known to us the path of life.
[743.64 → 746.64] In your presence there is fullness of joy.
[746.64 → 750.64] At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[750.64 → 754.64] We come to you this morning the only way we can.
[754.64 → 759.64] Not pretending, not presuming, but dependent and needy.
[759.64 → 766.64] We come in hope because you have revealed yourself as a God who is both merciful and gracious.
[766.64 → 770.64] Overflowing with steadfast love and faithfulness.
[770.64 → 775.64] So we ask that you would send your spirits among us this morning.
[775.64 → 783.64] That you might give hope to those who are despairing and discouraged.
[783.64 → 787.64] Would you give healing to those whose hearts are broken?
[787.64 → 790.64] Lift those who are low and humble.
[790.64 → 793.64] Give wisdom to the simple.
[793.64 → 795.64] Spiritual sight to the blind.
[795.64 → 799.64] And bring near to you those who are far off.
[799.64 → 804.64] That together we may come to know you more fully than we did before.
[804.64 → 810.64] And that we may confidently say that we have met with you this morning.
[810.64 → 813.64] Father, we are your children.
[813.64 → 816.64] We are rescued for your glory.
[816.64 → 818.64] And so teach us to sing.
[818.64 → 822.64] That we may join the everlasting choir of your people throughout the centuries.
[822.64 → 825.64] Both here on earth and in heaven.
[825.64 → 830.64] May your great and beautiful name be proclaimed both here and throughout the world this morning.
[830.64 → 833.64] We pray in the name of your son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[833.64 → 834.64] Amen.
[835.64 → 839.64] Now brothers and sisters, please rise in body or in spirit.
[839.64 → 843.64] For God's greeting to us from Psalm 95.
[843.64 → 848.64] Come, let us worship and bow down together.
[848.64 → 851.64] Let us kneel together before the Lord our maker.
[851.64 → 854.64] For he is our God.
[854.64 → 856.64] And we are the people of his pasture.
[856.64 → 859.64] The sheep of his hand.
[859.64 → 862.64] So as God has called us, and he has greeted us.
[862.64 → 866.64] Let's turn and let's greet one another as the body of Christ, the people of God.
[866.64 → 867.64] From God to God.
[867.64 → 868.64] Now you are here for the wonderful name.
[868.64 → 869.64] Please litho be on.

[882.62 → 885.64] We're going to get up.

[923.48 → 929.10] Who has now fled every grain of sand?
[929.66 → 934.84] Things and nations circle at his voice.
[935.22 → 941.18] All creation rises to rejoice.

[948.52 → 952.44] Come let us adore him.

[980.26 → 985.24] Who can question any of his words?
[985.70 → 990.68] Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[991.06 → 996.60] Who can fathom all his wondrous fears?
[996.60 → 1004.44] The old our God, seated on his throne,
[1004.44 → 1008.36] Come let us adore him.
[1008.36 → 1015.48] The old our King, nothing can compare.

[1137.78 → 1144.26] One generation will fall to the nest.
[1144.72 → 1150.06] Our God is good, and His hand is strong.
[1150.62 → 1155.68] All the world sings His marvellous hands.
[1156.10 → 1162.74] And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[1162.74 → 1169.96] And it is the Lord in all His ways.
[1170.30 → 1175.20] He's greatly to be praised.
[1176.06 → 1180.98] Learned to search for endless days.
[1181.38 → 1185.74] His greatness none could fathom.
[1187.00 → 1191.82] Our generation will fall to the nest.
[1191.82 → 1197.40] Our God is good, and His hand is strong.
[1197.98 → 1202.88] All the world sings His marvellous hands.
[1203.30 → 1210.06] And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[1211.96 → 1220.82] Now may your name be sung in every tongue, in every place.
[1221.82 → 1227.40] Seeing the name of your great love.
[1227.40 → 1232.12] In every generation.
[1232.12 → 1238.28] Our generation will fall to the nest.
[1238.28 → 1243.70] Our God is good, and His hand is strong.
[1243.70 → 1249.18] All the world sings His marvellous hands.
[1249.18 → 1255.90] And our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[1255.90 → 1284.38] In every country and herb.
[1284.38 → 1287.76] fresh on me.
[1287.76 → 1291.76] Spirit of the
[1291.76 → 1295.76] living God, all
[1295.76 → 1299.94] fresh on me.
[1300.84 → 1303.70] Help me,
[1303.92 → 1307.76] hold me, kill me,
[1309.68 → 1311.96] use me.
[1311.96 → 1316.06] Spirit of the
[1316.06 → 1317.96] living God,
[1319.20 → 1319.96] all
[1319.96 → 1323.96] fresh on me.
[1325.32 → 1327.96] Spirit of the
[1328.52 → 1329.96] living God,
[1331.52 → 1331.96] whom
[1331.96 → 1334.24] the love of
[1334.24 → 1336.14] soul
[1336.14 → 1338.34] in its
[1338.34 → 1340.38] smiling heart
[1340.38 → 1341.96] and
[1341.96 → 1342.38] life
[1342.38 → 1344.24] gave us
[1344.24 → 1345.64] one in
[1345.64 → 1347.62] love.
[1348.38 → 1350.38] How bold,
[1351.34 → 1352.38] caring,
[1354.28 → 1356.80] selfless,
[1357.24 → 1358.38] sharing,
[1360.60 → 1363.60] Spirit of the
[1363.60 → 1365.38] living God,
[1365.38 → 1369.44] fill our lives
[1369.44 → 1371.38] with love.
[1371.38 → 1383.40] So at this time,
[1383.54 → 1384.60] the children are
[1384.60 → 1387.60] welcomed and dismissed to go to their
[1387.60 → 1389.18] children's life classes.
[1389.18 → 1396.18] So later in the service,
[1396.64 → 1399.08] the scripture passage for today
[1399.08 → 1402.04] is about the unity of the church.
[1402.68 → 1404.14] It's about the unity of the church.
[1404.98 → 1409.18] And we've just been singing and asking God to move among us all,
[1409.26 → 1410.94] make us one in heart and mind,
[1411.06 → 1412.46] make us one in love,
[1413.42 → 1416.38] sharing and caring and these things.
[1416.38 → 1417.48] But, and yet,
[1417.94 → 1418.54] if we're honest,
[1418.64 → 1419.80] we struggle with those things.
[1420.26 → 1421.46] Rather than humble,
[1421.66 → 1422.64] we're often proud.
[1422.86 → 1424.02] Rather than caring,
[1424.16 → 1426.00] we're often not caring.
[1427.10 → 1430.38] And we struggle to love one another.
[1431.88 → 1434.34] And so that's why we come to this time of confession.
[1434.34 → 1436.86] And we look to Jesus.
[1437.48 → 1437.82] Jesus,
[1438.26 → 1440.42] who came to make us one
[1440.42 → 1441.74] and who works among us
[1441.74 → 1443.48] and who forgives us when we fail,
[1443.92 → 1446.66] but continually strengthens us by his Spirit
[1446.66 → 1449.02] to do what he has called us to do.
[1449.74 → 1452.36] So let's turn now in a time of confession
[1452.36 → 1454.12] to our God,
[1454.24 → 1455.42] and I will lead us
[1455.42 → 1456.94] in this prayer.
[1457.06 → 1459.08] Would you please pray with me?
[1460.68 → 1461.86] God of grace,
[1461.86 → 1464.70] we grieve that the church,
[1465.34 → 1466.94] which shares one spirit,
[1467.82 → 1468.64] one faith,
[1469.02 → 1469.60] one hope,
[1469.66 → 1470.38] and one calling,
[1470.92 → 1473.24] has become a broken communion
[1473.24 → 1475.12] in a broken world.
[1476.20 → 1478.50] The one body spans all time,
[1478.92 → 1479.52] place,
[1480.18 → 1480.52] race,
[1480.60 → 1481.26] and language.
[1482.16 → 1483.18] But in our fear,
[1483.28 → 1484.36] we have fled from
[1484.36 → 1485.64] and fought one another.
[1486.36 → 1487.52] And in our pride,
[1487.52 → 1489.80] we have mistaken our part
[1489.80 → 1491.22] for the whole.
[1492.78 → 1493.32] And yet, Lord,
[1493.38 → 1494.96] we marvel that you gather
[1494.96 → 1496.04] the broken pieces
[1496.04 → 1497.04] to do your work,
[1497.62 → 1499.58] that you bless us with joy,
[1500.10 → 1500.90] with growth,
[1500.98 → 1502.26] and with signs of unity.
[1503.66 → 1504.76] Forgive our sins
[1504.76 → 1507.12] and help us to commit ourselves
[1507.12 → 1508.92] to seeking and showing
[1508.92 → 1510.88] the unity of the body of Christ.
[1511.88 → 1512.88] In his name,
[1513.28 → 1513.82] we pray.
[1514.50 → 1514.88] Amen.
[1517.52 → 1534.92] Not what my lands have done
[1534.92 → 1539.70] nor save my guilty soul,
[1540.12 → 1542.78] but what my torment
[1542.78 → 1545.44] flesh has known
[1545.44 → 1550.66] Can make my spirit whole
[1550.66 → 1555.50] Not what I feel or do
[1555.50 → 1560.88] Can give me peace with God
[1560.88 → 1566.66] Not all the prayers and sighs and tears
[1566.66 → 1571.44] Can bear my awful love
[1571.44 → 1577.72] Your voice alone, O Lord
[1577.72 → 1582.64] Can speak to me of grace
[1582.64 → 1588.32] Your power alone, O Son of God
[1588.32 → 1593.48] Can all my sin erase
[1593.48 → 1598.44] No other word but yours
[1598.44 → 1603.22] No other blood will do
[1603.22 → 1609.14] No strength of God which is divine
[1609.14 → 1614.22] Can bear me safely through
[1614.22 → 1618.34] The God who promises his forgiveness
[1618.34 → 1623.38] With these words of comfort and assurance says in 1 Peter chapter 2
[1623.38 → 1631.94] You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people
[1631.94 → 1639.56] In order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
[1639.56 → 1644.44] Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people
[1644.44 → 1650.00] Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy
[1650.00 → 1655.80] So people of God, all of us together have received God's mercy in Christ
[1655.80 → 1659.04] In Christ we are redeemed, we are forgiven
[1659.04 → 1662.80] And we are made one community united in faith
[1662.80 → 1664.14] Thanks be to God
[1664.14 → 1667.70] Let's stand and let's sing the final stanza of that song together
[1667.70 → 1678.70] My grace of Christ of God
[1678.70 → 1683.26] My rest of love divine
[1683.26 → 1688.68] And with a fully with the heart
[1688.68 → 1693.60] I call this Saviour mine
[1693.60 → 1698.60] My Lord has saved my life
[1698.60 → 1703.54] And freely pardoned this
[1703.54 → 1709.38] I love because he first loved me
[1709.38 → 1715.54] I live because he lives
[1715.54 → 1742.64] The scripture reading today will be from Ephesians 4, 1-6
[1742.64 → 1746.66] As a prisoner for the Lord then
[1746.66 → 1750.94] I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received
[1750.94 → 1753.84] Be completely humble and gentle
[1753.84 → 1758.44] Be patient, bearing with one another in love
[1758.44 → 1763.56] Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace
[1763.56 → 1766.74] There is one body and one spirit
[1766.74 → 1770.10] Just as you were called to one hope when you were called
[1770.10 → 1773.72] One Lord, one faith, one baptism
[1773.72 → 1776.68] One God and Father of all
[1776.68 → 1780.88] Who is over all and through all and in all
[1780.88 → 1783.90] This is the word of the Lord
[1783.90 → 1785.78] Thanks be to God
[1785.78 → 1799.70] Please bow with me in prayer
[1799.70 → 1803.16] Our Father and our God
[1803.16 → 1805.82] Before we open your word
[1805.82 → 1808.62] We ask that you would humble our hearts before it
[1808.62 → 1812.40] Father give us full recognition
[1812.40 → 1815.20] That this is the very word of God that we have read
[1815.20 → 1818.18] And the truth for our lives
[1818.18 → 1821.56] And we ask that you would bless us by it
[1821.56 → 1824.30] And help us Lord to rejoice in it
[1824.30 → 1826.66] We pray in Jesus name
[1826.66 → 1827.70] Amen
[1827.70 → 1831.02] So friends we are in a sermon series
[1831.02 → 1833.10] In the letter of Ephesians
[1833.10 → 1834.50] We're about halfway through
[1834.50 → 1838.04] And Ephesians is a letter written by the Apostle Paul
[1838.04 → 1841.94] To the church in the ancient Roman city of Ephesus
[1841.94 → 1844.30] Around the year AD 60
[1844.30 → 1848.80] And our passage this morning as I mentioned is about unity
[1848.80 → 1853.84] Paul is calling us to get along with one another
[1853.84 → 1855.80] Right to show grace
[1855.80 → 1859.56] To dwell together in peace and in love
[1859.56 → 1864.48] Now if you have lived in the Vancouver area
[1864.48 → 1866.34] Or really any major city
[1866.34 → 1868.30] Over the last several decades
[1868.30 → 1872.56] You'll know that unity as a message is very popular isn't it
[1872.56 → 1876.36] If you say we should all get along
[1876.36 → 1878.10] We should coexist
[1878.10 → 1882.94] Then you will be greeted with applause and cheers
[1882.94 → 1886.78] Right showing universal acceptance
[1886.78 → 1888.94] Is the message of the day
[1888.94 → 1891.34] But what is the basis
[1891.34 → 1894.42] For peace and unity with other people
[1894.42 → 1896.90] That's our ideal
[1896.90 → 1898.42] But how can we do it
[1898.42 → 1899.40] What works
[1899.40 → 1900.88] Well one idea
[1900.88 → 1902.02] Here's one idea
[1902.02 → 1905.28] One of the most successful advertising campaigns
[1905.28 → 1907.10] Of all time
[1907.10 → 1908.86] Was a Coke commercial
[1908.86 → 1909.46] Coca-Cola
[1909.46 → 1912.82] It was aired in 1971
[1912.82 → 1915.78] So it's a one-minute commercial
[1915.78 → 1917.66] And we're going to play it for us
[1917.66 → 1923.22] I'd like to buy the world a home
[1923.22 → 1926.46] And furnish it with love
[1926.46 → 1929.78] Grow apple trees and honeybees
[1930.50 → 1933.78] And snow-white turtledoves
[1933.78 → 1937.54] I'd like to teach the world to sing
[1937.54 → 1938.26] Sing with me
[1938.26 → 1939.92] Perfect harmony
[1939.92 → 1941.58] Perfect harmony
[1941.58 → 1944.74] I'd like to buy the world a Coke
[1944.74 → 1947.06] And keep it company
[1947.06 → 1948.74] It's the real thing
[1948.74 → 1951.86] I'd like to teach the world to sing
[1951.86 → 1954.26] We're going to play harmony
[1954.26 → 1958.88] And I'd like to buy the world a Coke
[1958.88 → 1961.32] And keep it company
[1961.32 → 1963.74] It's the real thing
[1963.74 → 1967.68] What the world wants today
[1967.68 → 1971.18] Is the real thing
[1971.18 → 1974.90] What the world wants today
[1974.90 → 1978.00] Is the real thing
[1978.00 → 1982.56] It's pretty catchy
[1982.56 → 1984.42] Kind of feel like we should play it again
[1984.42 → 1985.28] And kind of clap along
[1985.28 → 1985.46] Right
[1985.46 → 1987.26] I was trying to restrain myself
[1987.26 → 1989.26] You know
[1989.26 → 1991.16] And just like any great marketing ad
[1991.16 → 1993.88] It immediately tugs at your heartstrings
[1993.88 → 1994.90] Right
[1994.90 → 1995.62] It pulls you in
[1995.62 → 1996.08] And you would think
[1996.08 → 1998.16] It really would be great
[1998.16 → 1999.92] If we could all sing together
[1999.92 → 2000.66] On a hillside
[2000.66 → 2001.54] And drink Coca-Cola
[2001.54 → 2002.80] Right
[2002.80 → 2003.84] It would be wonderful
[2003.84 → 2006.40] The world would be one
[2006.40 → 2007.36] Right
[2007.36 → 2010.62] But when we stop to think about it
[2010.62 → 2011.82] What does that even mean
[2011.82 → 2014.88] How would I buy the world a Coke
[2014.88 → 2016.42] If I could
[2016.42 → 2017.72] And would that even work
[2017.72 → 2020.56] Would be then all be at peace
[2020.56 → 2021.42] With one another
[2021.42 → 2023.58] Of course not
[2023.58 → 2026.48] But we still long
[2026.48 → 2028.72] For this experience of unity
[2028.72 → 2031.18] And we know it's the way
[2031.18 → 2033.14] Things are meant to be
[2033.14 → 2034.76] And we know that
[2034.76 → 2035.64] Because it's true
[2035.64 → 2036.52] Right
[2036.52 → 2038.00] That is the story
[2038.00 → 2039.26] Of the Bible as well
[2039.26 → 2041.30] The Bible tells us
[2041.30 → 2043.28] That because God is a Trinity
[2043.28 → 2045.00] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[2045.00 → 2047.56] Unity and harmony
[2047.56 → 2049.22] And a community of love
[2049.22 → 2052.08] Is at the centre of all things
[2052.08 → 2053.84] Because God is at the centre
[2053.84 → 2054.56] Of all things
[2054.56 → 2056.86] And when God made us
[2056.86 → 2057.68] Human beings
[2057.68 → 2058.74] Men and women and children
[2058.74 → 2060.62] He made us to share
[2060.62 → 2061.74] In that unity
[2061.74 → 2063.02] Of the triune God
[2063.02 → 2064.92] And to share that unity
[2064.92 → 2065.80] With God
[2065.80 → 2067.00] And with other people
[2067.00 → 2069.66] But because of sin
[2069.66 → 2071.84] That unity was broken
[2071.84 → 2074.16] And the next thing we see
[2074.16 → 2075.92] Is that Adam and Eve
[2075.92 → 2078.38] Being expelled from the garden
[2078.38 → 2080.40] Away from unity with God
[2080.40 → 2081.92] And then we see Cain
[2081.92 → 2083.24] Killing his brother Abel
[2083.24 → 2086.88] And now even the best relationships
[2086.88 → 2088.48] In this life
[2088.48 → 2089.50] Have that element
[2089.50 → 2091.08] Of disunity in them
[2091.08 → 2093.22] And we all experience this
[2093.22 → 2093.76] In our lives
[2093.76 → 2094.48] The sorrow
[2094.48 → 2095.94] Of disunity
[2095.94 → 2098.82] But God loves you
[2098.82 → 2100.72] And God loves this world
[2100.72 → 2101.92] And he has a plan
[2101.92 → 2103.18] To redeem the world
[2103.18 → 2104.56] And to restore
[2104.56 → 2105.70] Wholeness
[2105.70 → 2106.96] And unity to it
[2106.96 → 2108.78] So yeah
[2108.78 → 2109.68] In a sense
[2109.68 → 2111.22] We were meant to stand
[2111.22 → 2111.84] On a hillside
[2111.84 → 2112.56] And sing together
[2112.56 → 2114.26] And we know
[2114.26 → 2115.20] That was the way
[2115.20 → 2116.18] Things were meant to be
[2116.18 → 2116.82] But that somehow
[2116.82 → 2118.28] It was lost to us
[2118.28 → 2120.96] That's the biblical message
[2120.96 → 2123.24] Christianity is a religion
[2123.24 → 2125.00] Of unity and acceptance
[2125.00 → 2125.98] So we need to
[2125.98 → 2127.28] Recognize that
[2127.28 → 2128.18] And celebrate it
[2128.18 → 2130.36] But that message of unity
[2130.36 → 2131.68] In order to be biblical
[2131.68 → 2133.74] And not worldly
[2133.74 → 2135.64] Must be a unity
[2135.64 → 2136.74] That is not something
[2136.74 → 2138.44] That we try to create
[2138.44 → 2139.28] With Coca-Cola
[2139.28 → 2140.82] Or anything else
[2140.82 → 2142.38] But it's rather something
[2142.38 → 2144.08] That God is doing
[2144.08 → 2144.72] In the world
[2144.72 → 2146.84] So here in Ephesians
[2146.84 → 2148.64] Paul has been telling us
[2148.64 → 2150.72] About God's amazing plan
[2150.72 → 2152.32] To unite all things
[2152.32 → 2153.00] Everything
[2153.00 → 2153.54] In heaven
[2153.54 → 2154.38] And on earth
[2154.38 → 2155.24] Together
[2155.24 → 2156.38] Bring them back together
[2156.38 → 2157.42] In Jesus Christ
[2157.42 → 2159.82] And then in chapter 3
[2159.82 → 2160.86] Paul told us
[2160.86 → 2161.82] That the church
[2161.82 → 2164.74] Is the foretaste
[2164.74 → 2166.48] And it is a picture
[2166.48 → 2167.78] Of what God is doing
[2167.78 → 2169.04] In the entire universe
[2169.04 → 2170.78] To bring all things together
[2170.78 → 2172.08] In Christ
[2172.08 → 2174.72] And so you get to be
[2174.72 → 2175.64] A part of that
[2175.64 → 2177.20] And we see
[2177.20 → 2178.22] The world can see
[2178.22 → 2179.22] The unity that God
[2179.22 → 2179.80] Is creating
[2179.80 → 2180.56] Most clearly
[2180.56 → 2181.94] In the church
[2181.94 → 2184.62] But to be honest
[2184.62 → 2186.10] Being a unified community
[2186.10 → 2187.58] Is not easy
[2187.58 → 2189.00] Right?
[2189.06 → 2189.98] Because in the church
[2189.98 → 2192.64] It's not a social club
[2192.64 → 2193.46] You don't just hang out
[2193.46 → 2194.78] With people who are like you
[2194.78 → 2195.54] And that you like
[2195.54 → 2196.38] And that do exactly
[2196.38 → 2197.20] What you like to do
[2197.20 → 2198.66] In the church
[2198.66 → 2199.16] You have people
[2199.16 → 2200.10] From all kinds
[2200.10 → 2201.42] Of different ethnicities
[2201.42 → 2203.40] Different religious
[2203.40 → 2204.82] And social backgrounds
[2204.82 → 2205.90] You have people
[2205.90 → 2207.06] With different personalities
[2207.06 → 2208.26] And different priorities
[2208.26 → 2210.34] And that's why
[2210.34 → 2211.34] In chapter 4
[2211.34 → 2212.10] Now
[2212.10 → 2213.70] We begin chapter 4
[2213.70 → 2214.22] In Ephesians
[2214.22 → 2215.08] Paul begins
[2215.08 → 2216.16] To tell us now
[2216.16 → 2217.76] How we can live out
[2217.76 → 2218.72] The gospel unity
[2218.72 → 2220.84] That God has created
[2220.84 → 2222.06] And that's what
[2222.06 → 2222.94] He's going to talk about
[2222.94 → 2223.64] In the next
[2223.64 → 2224.74] Not yet
[2224.74 → 2226.54] That's what he's going to talk about
[2226.54 → 2227.24] In the next
[2227.24 → 2228.14] Several chapters
[2228.14 → 2229.64] He's going to start
[2229.64 → 2230.76] Giving us these instructions
[2230.76 → 2232.94] For how can we live together
[2232.94 → 2233.76] As the church
[2233.76 → 2235.60] And it starts here
[2235.60 → 2238.74] In verses 4 to 6
[2238.74 → 2239.50] In chapter 4
[2239.50 → 2241.54] So we've looked at
[2241.54 → 2242.66] Chapters 1 through 3
[2242.66 → 2244.02] And then there's 4 to 6
[2244.02 → 2244.90] Is the rest of the
[2244.90 → 2246.52] Of the letter of Ephesians
[2246.52 → 2248.12] And right here in chapter 4
[2248.12 → 2249.06] Is a major transition
[2249.06 → 2251.06] Where in chapters 1 through 3
[2251.06 → 2252.12] God talked about
[2252.12 → 2253.00] Paul talked about
[2253.00 → 2254.66] The wonders of God's plan
[2254.66 → 2255.24] In the gospel
[2255.24 → 2257.64] And then in chapters 4 to 6
[2257.64 → 2258.24] He's going to
[2258.24 → 2259.28] It's going to be
[2259.28 → 2260.38] Kind of on the ground
[2260.38 → 2261.62] How do we live this out
[2261.62 → 2263.26] And so we start here
[2263.26 → 2265.04] In 4 to 6
[2265.04 → 2265.38] And so
[2265.38 → 2266.12] We're ready
[2266.12 → 2269.26] So this is the passage we read
[2269.26 → 2270.18] Verses 4 to 6
[2270.18 → 2271.10] And I want you to notice
[2271.10 → 2272.02] As we read it again
[2272.02 → 2273.42] How many times
[2273.42 → 2274.00] He uses
[2274.00 → 2274.96] The word
[2274.96 → 2275.64] One
[2275.64 → 2276.88] Okay
[2276.88 → 2277.74] So let's count
[2277.74 → 2278.78] In your head
[2278.78 → 2279.76] Or out loud
[2279.76 → 2280.26] If you want
[2280.26 → 2281.28] As we go
[2281.28 → 2282.86] There is
[2282.86 → 2284.46] One body
[2284.46 → 2286.14] And one spirit
[2286.14 → 2287.76] Just as you were called
[2287.76 → 2288.96] To one hope
[2288.96 → 2289.80] When you were called
[2289.80 → 2291.20] One Lord
[2291.20 → 2292.60] One faith
[2292.60 → 2294.12] One baptism
[2294.12 → 2296.74] One God and Father of all
[2296.74 → 2298.28] Who is over all
[2298.28 → 2299.46] And through all
[2299.46 → 2300.26] And in all
[2300.26 → 2301.54] How many?
[2302.66 → 2303.26] Seven
[2303.26 → 2303.28] Seven
[2303.28 → 2303.94] I heard
[2303.94 → 2305.02] I heard something else
[2305.02 → 2305.22] But
[2305.22 → 2307.16] It's seven
[2307.16 → 2307.44] Yeah
[2307.44 → 2310.48] And so
[2310.48 → 2311.70] Paul uses
[2311.70 → 2312.88] The word
[2312.88 → 2313.32] One
[2313.32 → 2314.38] Seven times
[2314.38 → 2317.48] And we need to look
[2317.48 → 2318.28] At each one of these
[2318.28 → 2319.34] Because this is
[2319.34 → 2320.52] The basis of our unity
[2320.52 → 2322.64] Together as the family of God
[2322.64 → 2323.14] So today
[2323.14 → 2323.76] Instead of a two
[2323.76 → 2324.62] Or three point sermons
[2324.62 → 2325.16] There's going to be
[2325.16 → 2326.16] A seven point sermon
[2326.16 → 2327.32] Yes
[2327.32 → 2328.40] But don't worry
[2328.40 → 2330.40] I just want to make
[2330.40 → 2331.30] A brief comment
[2331.30 → 2333.06] About each one of these
[2333.06 → 2334.14] To help us
[2334.14 → 2334.36] You know
[2334.36 → 2335.50] To expand it out
[2335.50 → 2335.80] For us
[2335.80 → 2336.76] Because the definition
[2336.76 → 2337.72] Of the church
[2337.72 → 2339.20] Comes from
[2339.20 → 2340.10] These verses
[2340.10 → 2340.82] Right here
[2340.82 → 2342.80] Okay so first
[2342.80 → 2344.08] There is one what?
[2345.12 → 2345.96] One body
[2345.96 → 2348.50] The reason we are unified
[2348.50 → 2350.48] Is that we are members
[2350.48 → 2352.20] Of one body
[2352.20 → 2354.26] The body of the Lord Jesus
[2354.26 → 2357.22] So now in 1 Corinthians
[2357.22 → 2358.48] Chapter 12
[2358.48 → 2360.70] Paul develops this image
[2360.70 → 2361.56] Even further
[2361.56 → 2362.90] It's kind of a familiar passage
[2362.90 → 2364.58] But I just want to share
[2364.58 → 2365.20] A couple verses
[2365.20 → 2366.50] Paul says
[2366.50 → 2367.72] Just as a body
[2367.72 → 2369.28] The one has many parts
[2369.28 → 2371.28] But all its many parts
[2371.28 → 2372.54] Form one body
[2372.54 → 2374.10] So it is with Christ
[2374.10 → 2376.08] For we were all baptized
[2376.08 → 2377.26] By one spirit
[2377.26 → 2379.32] To form one body
[2379.32 → 2380.64] Even so
[2380.64 → 2381.76] The body is not made up
[2381.76 → 2383.12] Of one part
[2383.12 → 2384.84] But many
[2384.84 → 2385.96] Right
[2385.96 → 2386.68] So with a body
[2386.68 → 2388.18] We have some eyes
[2388.18 → 2390.82] We have some ears
[2390.82 → 2391.88] We have some arms
[2391.88 → 2393.46] This is a unity
[2393.46 → 2394.66] That welcomes diversity
[2394.66 → 2395.74] Eyes and ears
[2395.74 → 2396.12] And arms
[2396.12 → 2397.18] And all these different parts
[2397.18 → 2398.08] You know
[2398.08 → 2398.94] If you have a face
[2398.94 → 2400.02] Full of noses
[2400.02 → 2402.08] That would be a problem
[2402.08 → 2402.74] Right?
[2402.94 → 2404.46] That would be very unpleasant
[2404.46 → 2405.28] To look at
[2405.28 → 2406.40] Noses everywhere
[2406.40 → 2408.84] We want diversity
[2408.84 → 2408.86] We want diversity
[2408.86 → 2410.72] In our unity
[2410.72 → 2412.28] Many members
[2412.28 → 2413.02] In one body
[2413.02 → 2414.74] So then Paul goes on
[2414.74 → 2416.12] And he says this
[2416.12 → 2418.68] The eye cannot say
[2418.68 → 2419.34] To the hand
[2419.34 → 2420.56] I don't need you
[2420.56 → 2422.62] And the head cannot say
[2422.62 → 2423.14] To the feet
[2423.14 → 2424.06] I don't need you
[2424.06 → 2425.60] But God has put
[2425.60 → 2426.56] The body together
[2426.56 → 2428.10] Giving greater honour
[2428.10 → 2428.76] To the parts
[2428.76 → 2429.48] That lacked it
[2429.48 → 2430.76] So that there should be
[2430.76 → 2432.64] No division
[2432.64 → 2433.64] In the body
[2433.64 → 2435.54] But that is
[2435.54 → 2436.50] Parts should have
[2436.50 → 2437.42] Equal concern
[2437.42 → 2438.54] For each other
[2438.54 → 2440.50] Here Paul is saying
[2440.50 → 2441.40] That there is no
[2441.40 → 2443.34] Insignificant member
[2443.34 → 2444.50] In the body of Christ
[2444.50 → 2446.90] Do you think
[2446.90 → 2448.38] That the great
[2448.38 → 2449.86] Theologians
[2449.86 → 2451.24] Of the faith
[2451.24 → 2452.06] The great teachers
[2452.06 → 2452.84] Of the faith
[2452.84 → 2453.62] Are somehow
[2453.62 → 2454.68] More important
[2454.68 → 2456.50] Than a deaconess
[2456.50 → 2457.88] Who makes a meal
[2457.88 → 2458.96] Brings it to some
[2458.96 → 2459.56] Shut-ins
[2459.56 → 2461.64] And prays it with them
[2461.64 → 2462.42] And asks them
[2462.42 → 2463.32] About their grandchildren
[2463.32 → 2464.98] Is she somehow
[2464.98 → 2465.94] Less valuable
[2465.94 → 2468.16] Or do you think
[2468.16 → 2468.70] A missionary
[2468.70 → 2470.60] In a foreign field
[2470.60 → 2471.98] Is doing more
[2471.98 → 2472.92] Valuable work
[2472.92 → 2473.58] Than you
[2473.58 → 2475.24] Inviting your neighbour
[2475.24 → 2476.12] To get coffee
[2476.12 → 2477.72] To share your life
[2477.72 → 2478.18] With them
[2478.18 → 2479.30] And maybe
[2479.30 → 2480.30] To have an opportunity
[2480.30 → 2481.90] To share about
[2481.90 → 2482.86] What God is doing
[2482.86 → 2483.50] In your life
[2483.50 → 2484.98] No
[2484.98 → 2487.30] God says
[2487.30 → 2487.98] That you can't
[2487.98 → 2488.60] Cut off
[2488.60 → 2489.24] What you think
[2489.24 → 2490.10] Is less important
[2490.10 → 2491.14] And maintain
[2491.14 → 2491.96] The body
[2491.96 → 2494.00] It's got to stay together
[2494.00 → 2494.78] All Christians
[2494.78 → 2495.42] In the church
[2495.42 → 2496.16] Of Jesus Christ
[2496.16 → 2497.82] Belong together
[2497.82 → 2499.30] And are gifted
[2499.30 → 2500.48] To do whatever
[2500.48 → 2501.22] It is that God
[2501.22 → 2502.18] Calls each one
[2502.18 → 2502.72] Of us
[2502.72 → 2503.38] To do
[2503.38 → 2506.64] If you have ever
[2506.64 → 2507.48] Received an email
[2507.48 → 2508.02] From Marian
[2508.02 → 2509.78] She has a quote
[2509.78 → 2510.62] At the bottom
[2510.62 → 2511.90] Of her emails
[2511.90 → 2512.72] From Mother Teresa
[2512.72 → 2514.84] So this is what
[2514.84 → 2515.92] The quote says
[2515.92 → 2517.98] What you are doing
[2517.98 → 2518.00] What you are doing
[2518.00 → 2519.32] I may not be able
[2519.32 → 2519.72] To do
[2519.72 → 2521.48] What I am doing
[2521.48 → 2522.26] You may not
[2522.26 → 2522.90] Be able to do
[2522.90 → 2524.00] But all of us
[2524.00 → 2524.42] Together
[2524.42 → 2525.78] Are doing something
[2525.78 → 2526.26] Beautiful
[2526.26 → 2527.26] For God
[2527.26 → 2529.52] If you want to
[2529.52 → 2530.68] Note that down
[2530.68 → 2532.14] Send Mary an email
[2532.14 → 2533.02] She'll respond
[2533.02 → 2533.76] I didn't ask permission
[2533.76 → 2535.34] But I think she would
[2535.34 → 2536.30] And then you'll have it
[2536.30 → 2538.68] So second
[2538.68 → 2540.50] There is one spirit
[2540.50 → 2542.98] The spirit here
[2542.98 → 2544.62] Is the Holy Spirit
[2544.62 → 2546.24] And the role of
[2546.24 → 2546.96] The Holy Spirit
[2546.96 → 2547.76] In salvation
[2547.76 → 2549.06] Is that it is the spirit
[2549.06 → 2549.86] Who comes into
[2549.86 → 2550.72] A person's heart
[2550.72 → 2552.36] To lead them to Christ
[2552.36 → 2555.22] Remember what Paul said
[2555.22 → 2556.20] Back in chapter 1
[2556.20 → 2557.06] In verse 13
[2557.06 → 2559.10] He says this
[2559.10 → 2562.44] And you also
[2562.44 → 2563.12] Were included
[2563.12 → 2564.22] In Christ
[2564.22 → 2565.32] When you heard
[2565.32 → 2566.62] The message of truth
[2566.62 → 2567.58] The gospel
[2567.58 → 2568.40] Of your salvation
[2568.40 → 2570.00] When you believed
[2570.00 → 2571.26] You were marked in him
[2571.26 → 2572.10] With a seal
[2572.10 → 2573.40] The promised Holy Spirit
[2573.40 → 2575.56] Now have you ever been
[2575.56 → 2576.72] At a Christian get-together
[2576.72 → 2577.58] Maybe a fellowship
[2577.58 → 2578.80] Time
[2578.80 → 2580.48] Or even a worship service
[2580.48 → 2581.06] Like this
[2581.06 → 2581.98] Where people give
[2581.98 → 2583.06] Their testimonies
[2583.06 → 2584.72] Of how they came
[2584.72 → 2585.52] To know Christ
[2585.52 → 2587.00] You know maybe
[2587.00 → 2587.86] Someone says
[2587.86 → 2589.58] I was out on a
[2589.58 → 2590.38] Camping trip
[2590.38 → 2591.74] And a friend
[2591.74 → 2592.76] Led me to Christ
[2592.76 → 2593.64] By the campfire
[2593.64 → 2596.28] And somebody says
[2596.28 → 2597.02] Well for me
[2597.02 → 2597.56] I remember
[2597.56 → 2598.82] I was in grade 5
[2598.82 → 2600.58] And it was a summer break
[2600.58 → 2601.36] I went to visit
[2601.36 → 2601.86] My uncle
[2601.86 → 2602.72] And my aunt
[2602.72 → 2603.72] And my
[2603.72 → 2605.44] God used my uncle
[2605.44 → 2606.70] To make the gospel
[2606.70 → 2607.50] Plain to me
[2607.50 → 2609.96] Or somebody says
[2609.96 → 2611.10] I was a student
[2611.10 → 2611.80] In university
[2611.80 → 2613.16] And my roommate
[2613.16 → 2614.04] Invited me to a
[2614.04 → 2615.08] Christian fellowship group
[2615.08 → 2616.70] And I heard the gospel
[2616.70 → 2617.06] There
[2617.06 → 2618.94] Right there are
[2618.94 → 2620.22] Lots of different ways
[2620.22 → 2621.10] That people
[2621.10 → 2622.24] Get to Christ
[2622.24 → 2623.88] You can get to Christ
[2623.88 → 2624.84] In a thousand ways
[2624.84 → 2625.56] But you can only
[2625.56 → 2626.48] Get to God
[2626.48 → 2627.44] One way
[2627.44 → 2629.78] When Jesus said
[2629.78 → 2631.06] I am the way
[2631.06 → 2631.64] And the truth
[2631.64 → 2632.26] And the life
[2632.26 → 2632.94] And no one comes
[2632.94 → 2633.52] To the Father
[2633.52 → 2634.58] Except by me
[2634.58 → 2635.72] He's saying
[2635.72 → 2636.76] We all must
[2636.76 → 2637.94] Come through the door
[2637.94 → 2639.16] Right
[2639.16 → 2640.28] You can get to the door
[2640.28 → 2641.58] In a million different ways
[2641.58 → 2642.84] But you can only get
[2642.84 → 2643.56] To the Father
[2643.56 → 2645.12] Through the door
[2645.12 → 2646.32] That is Jesus Christ
[2646.32 → 2648.88] The scriptures tell us
[2648.88 → 2649.78] That there is one
[2649.78 → 2650.86] Holy Spirit
[2650.86 → 2652.44] And it's the same
[2652.44 → 2653.14] Holy Spirit
[2653.14 → 2654.28] That brings every
[2654.28 → 2655.66] Single one of us
[2655.66 → 2656.66] Every single Christian
[2656.66 → 2658.12] To the Father
[2658.12 → 2659.14] In the same way
[2659.14 → 2659.96] By bringing us
[2659.96 → 2661.06] To the Son
[2661.06 → 2662.32] Of God
[2662.32 → 2663.52] Jesus Christ
[2663.52 → 2665.68] So let me ask you
[2665.68 → 2666.20] This morning
[2666.20 → 2667.44] Very practically
[2667.44 → 2669.68] Has the Spirit of God
[2669.68 → 2671.04] Come into your life
[2671.04 → 2673.50] When God
[2673.50 → 2674.28] By the Holy Spirit
[2674.28 → 2675.64] Comes into a person's life
[2675.64 → 2677.44] He never leaves
[2677.44 → 2679.92] He makes himself
[2679.92 → 2680.44] At home
[2680.44 → 2681.62] He sets up camp
[2681.62 → 2683.12] He turns on the lights
[2683.12 → 2684.94] He brings you
[2684.94 → 2685.82] To repentance
[2685.82 → 2687.54] And points you
[2687.54 → 2688.20] To Jesus
[2688.20 → 2689.88] Who on that cross
[2689.88 → 2691.44] Told you
[2691.44 → 2692.44] That he loves you
[2692.44 → 2694.04] And that he died for you
[2694.04 → 2695.78] And it's the Holy Spirit
[2695.78 → 2696.88] Working in your heart
[2696.88 → 2697.66] That enables you
[2697.66 → 2698.04] To say
[2698.04 → 2699.04] Without Jesus
[2699.04 → 2700.84] I would perish
[2700.84 → 2701.92] But
[2701.92 → 2703.24] By his death
[2703.24 → 2704.82] My sins have been forgiven
[2704.82 → 2706.38] And now he gives me
[2706.38 → 2707.06] The power
[2707.06 → 2708.16] To live a new life
[2708.16 → 2709.34] That is pleasing to God
[2709.34 → 2713.46] So there is one body
[2713.46 → 2714.70] And there is one spirit
[2714.70 → 2716.12] And third
[2716.12 → 2716.94] The spirit
[2716.94 → 2718.50] Calls us to one hope
[2718.50 → 2721.00] And this one hope
[2721.00 → 2721.98] What it refers to
[2721.98 → 2723.02] Is the return
[2723.02 → 2724.58] Of Jesus Christ
[2724.58 → 2726.32] And so you know
[2726.32 → 2726.86] No matter
[2726.86 → 2728.14] When you think about the church
[2728.14 → 2730.52] What kind of divides the church
[2730.52 → 2731.88] Is all this stuff
[2731.88 → 2732.90] That happened in history
[2732.90 → 2734.68] All these things
[2734.68 → 2735.50] That caused us
[2735.50 → 2737.44] To move off
[2737.44 → 2738.50] In different directions
[2738.50 → 2739.34] Even though
[2739.34 → 2740.18] We are spiritually
[2740.18 → 2741.32] One church
[2741.32 → 2743.22] And then we look
[2743.22 → 2743.98] At our present
[2743.98 → 2745.62] And there are many things
[2745.62 → 2746.50] That divide us
[2746.50 → 2747.12] In the present
[2747.12 → 2748.96] Our ideas
[2748.96 → 2750.82] About what the Bible says
[2750.82 → 2753.42] Even cultural ideas
[2753.42 → 2754.46] That we have to take
[2754.46 → 2755.46] Stances on
[2755.46 → 2756.40] Or feel that we do
[2756.40 → 2757.36] That divide us
[2757.36 → 2758.14] In the church
[2758.14 → 2759.78] But friends
[2759.78 → 2760.72] We have a common
[2760.72 → 2761.96] Future hope
[2761.96 → 2763.54] Whatever it is
[2763.54 → 2764.24] That divided us
[2764.24 → 2764.74] In the past
[2764.74 → 2765.20] Or future
[2765.20 → 2766.28] We are all moving
[2766.28 → 2766.88] Together
[2766.88 → 2768.60] To one future
[2768.60 → 2769.52] In certain hope
[2769.52 → 2770.78] And so can you
[2770.78 → 2771.96] Imagine yourselves
[2771.96 → 2774.80] Sitting with other believers
[2774.80 → 2776.20] From all over the world
[2776.20 → 2776.94] From every tongue
[2776.94 → 2777.78] Tribe and nation
[2777.78 → 2779.22] At the great supper
[2779.22 → 2780.14] Of the Lamb
[2780.14 → 2782.30] In joy unspeakable
[2782.30 → 2784.74] Then how do you
[2784.74 → 2785.52] View that?
[2785.52 → 2787.02] Right?
[2787.06 → 2787.66] When Paul says
[2787.66 → 2788.62] One hope
[2788.62 → 2790.36] He doesn't mean it
[2790.36 → 2791.78] The way we often do
[2791.78 → 2792.40] Which is like
[2792.40 → 2793.82] Something we hope
[2793.82 → 2794.44] Will happen
[2794.44 → 2795.44] But I don't know
[2795.44 → 2796.90] It's a little bit
[2796.90 → 2797.42] Uncertain
[2797.42 → 2798.60] I hope
[2798.60 → 2800.86] No, when we say
[2800.86 → 2801.54] Things like
[2801.54 → 2803.32] My hope is in the Lord
[2803.32 → 2805.30] It means I have
[2805.30 → 2805.98] A sure
[2805.98 → 2807.56] And certain hope
[2807.56 → 2809.08] Because of what
[2809.08 → 2810.38] Jesus has already
[2810.38 → 2811.24] Done for me
[2811.24 → 2812.62] I know that
[2812.62 → 2813.78] This is what is coming
[2813.78 → 2814.78] Right?
[2814.78 → 2815.86] I know that
[2815.86 → 2816.66] He was born
[2816.66 → 2817.38] Of a virgin
[2817.38 → 2818.66] That he did
[2818.66 → 2819.54] What God sent him
[2819.54 → 2820.38] In the world to do
[2820.38 → 2821.82] That he died on the cross
[2821.82 → 2823.04] He rose again
[2823.04 → 2823.56] From the dead
[2823.56 → 2824.88] He ascended into heaven
[2824.88 → 2826.64] And because these things
[2826.64 → 2827.36] Are true
[2827.36 → 2829.02] My hope
[2829.02 → 2830.26] Of dwelling with him
[2830.26 → 2830.88] Forever
[2830.88 → 2833.16] Is also true
[2833.16 → 2835.74] Why have our brothers
[2835.74 → 2836.24] And sisters
[2836.24 → 2837.26] Throughout the ages
[2837.26 → 2838.90] Died for their faith?
[2838.90 → 2840.32] Not because
[2840.32 → 2840.92] I hope
[2840.92 → 2842.78] But because
[2842.78 → 2843.84] There's hope
[2843.84 → 2844.74] Is certain
[2844.74 → 2847.70] I'm not just wishing
[2847.70 → 2849.26] That it will happen
[2849.26 → 2850.16] It's a hope
[2850.16 → 2850.90] And it is a hope
[2850.90 → 2851.58] That every single
[2851.58 → 2852.46] Christian shares
[2852.46 → 2853.76] We have
[2853.76 → 2855.20] A common hope
[2855.20 → 2857.40] And then in verse 5
[2857.40 → 2858.62] One Lord
[2858.62 → 2860.76] There are not
[2860.76 → 2862.28] Many Lords
[2862.28 → 2864.04] There is one Lord
[2864.04 → 2864.76] The Lord
[2864.76 → 2865.60] Jesus Christ
[2865.60 → 2867.48] I read this
[2867.48 → 2868.10] Funny
[2868.10 → 2869.42] Illustration
[2869.42 → 2870.14] This week
[2870.14 → 2871.02] Told by a Scottish
[2871.02 → 2871.54] Pastor
[2871.54 → 2872.64] Is Row here?
[2873.34 → 2873.60] Okay
[2873.60 → 2874.40] Yes
[2874.40 → 2874.96] I thought of you
[2874.96 → 2877.86] It's about a conversation
[2877.86 → 2878.26] That
[2878.26 → 2879.26] You know
[2879.26 → 2879.92] Imaginatively
[2879.92 → 2880.92] Might have taken place
[2880.92 → 2881.28] Between
[2881.28 → 2882.72] The man who was
[2882.72 → 2883.40] Born blind
[2883.40 → 2884.84] In the gospel
[2884.84 → 2885.48] Of John
[2885.48 → 2886.36] John chapter 9
[2886.36 → 2887.14] Who Jesus heals
[2887.14 → 2889.42] And another man
[2889.42 → 2890.12] Born blind
[2890.12 → 2891.72] Who Jesus heals
[2891.72 → 2892.68] In Mark 8
[2892.68 → 2894.46] So the John 9
[2894.46 → 2895.28] Blind guy
[2895.28 → 2896.10] And the Mark 8
[2896.10 → 2896.58] Blind guy
[2896.58 → 2898.62] In John 9
[2898.62 → 2899.96] We're not going to get
[2899.96 → 2900.46] Into this
[2900.46 → 2901.42] But Jesus spits
[2901.42 → 2901.92] On the ground
[2901.92 → 2902.78] Different story
[2902.78 → 2903.50] But he spits
[2903.50 → 2903.96] On the ground
[2903.96 → 2904.90] He makes some mud
[2904.90 → 2906.16] And he puts it
[2906.16 → 2907.20] On the man's eyes
[2907.20 → 2908.16] And heals him
[2908.16 → 2910.40] In Mark 8
[2910.40 → 2912.60] He spits
[2912.60 → 2913.18] He's a spittle
[2913.18 → 2914.06] And he puts it
[2914.06 → 2914.70] On his eyes
[2914.70 → 2915.28] And heals him
[2915.28 → 2915.70] But he doesn't
[2915.70 → 2916.18] Make the mud
[2916.18 → 2918.42] So these two guys
[2918.42 → 2919.12] They get together
[2919.12 → 2920.16] And they discuss
[2920.16 → 2921.30] How Jesus healed them
[2921.30 → 2922.32] The first guy
[2922.32 → 2922.88] Who is healed
[2922.88 → 2923.62] With the mud
[2923.62 → 2924.48] Tells his story
[2924.48 → 2925.48] And then the guy
[2925.48 → 2926.00] Who is healed
[2926.00 → 2926.84] Without the mud
[2926.84 → 2928.10] Tells his story
[2928.10 → 2929.44] And the first guy
[2929.44 → 2929.90] Says
[2929.90 → 2930.38] You know
[2930.38 → 2931.08] After the second guy
[2931.08 → 2931.70] Told his story
[2931.70 → 2932.50] The first guy says
[2932.50 → 2933.32] Wait
[2933.32 → 2934.16] You left out the part
[2934.16 → 2934.76] About Jesus
[2934.76 → 2935.64] Making the mud
[2935.64 → 2936.14] And putting it
[2936.14 → 2936.70] On your eye
[2936.70 → 2938.20] And the second guy
[2938.20 → 2938.48] Says
[2938.48 → 2939.66] I don't know
[2939.66 → 2940.32] Anything about that
[2940.32 → 2941.00] What are you talking about
[2941.00 → 2943.04] And the first man
[2943.04 → 2943.54] Says
[2943.54 → 2943.88] Well
[2943.88 → 2945.50] It has to be that way
[2945.50 → 2946.90] Because that's the way
[2946.90 → 2947.84] Jesus gives sight
[2947.84 → 2948.34] To people
[2948.34 → 2949.32] He must have forgotten
[2949.32 → 2951.16] Oh no
[2951.16 → 2952.48] The second man says
[2952.48 → 2953.60] Jesus didn't do that
[2953.60 → 2954.04] With me
[2954.04 → 2955.58] He just put his hands
[2955.58 → 2956.20] On my eyes
[2956.20 → 2956.84] And I received
[2956.84 → 2957.46] My sight
[2957.46 → 2959.22] The first man says
[2959.22 → 2959.96] That isn't right
[2959.96 → 2961.54] Jesus heals
[2961.54 → 2962.12] With mud
[2962.12 → 2963.84] I'm beginning to doubt
[2963.84 → 2964.80] That you can see
[2964.80 → 2967.38] And thus originated
[2967.38 → 2968.52] In the early church
[2968.52 → 2969.42] The denomination
[2969.42 → 2970.24] Of the suites
[2970.24 → 2971.62] And the anti-Semites
[2971.62 → 2975.12] We need mud
[2975.12 → 2975.68] Don't we
[2975.68 → 2977.42] Obviously not
[2977.42 → 2978.88] Right
[2978.88 → 2979.18] Well
[2979.18 → 2980.12] Why did Jesus
[2980.12 → 2981.02] Use mud this time
[2981.02 → 2982.00] And he didn't use mud
[2982.00 → 2982.64] Another time
[2982.64 → 2984.22] It's because he's Jesus
[2984.22 → 2985.26] And he can do
[2985.26 → 2986.08] Whatever he wants
[2986.08 → 2988.06] And he doesn't want us
[2988.06 → 2989.46] Focusing on the mud
[2989.46 → 2991.66] Or the non-mud
[2991.66 → 2992.86] He wants us focusing
[2992.86 → 2993.60] On him
[2993.60 → 2995.94] And he is the one
[2995.94 → 2996.54] Who heals us
[2996.54 → 2997.22] He is our Lord
[2997.22 → 2998.02] And often so much
[2998.02 → 2998.70] Of our disunity
[2998.70 → 2999.38] In the church
[2999.38 → 3000.78] Is when we focus
[3000.78 → 3001.26] On the way
[3001.26 → 3002.52] God has worked
[3002.52 → 3003.42] In the past
[3003.42 → 3004.26] Our experiences
[3004.26 → 3005.54] Of God's working
[3005.54 → 3006.18] In us
[3006.18 → 3007.36] And we think
[3007.36 → 3008.14] It should be the same
[3008.14 → 3008.52] Sorry
[3008.52 → 3009.44] For everybody
[3009.44 → 3012.12] But what unites us
[3012.12 → 3013.14] As the body of Christ
[3013.14 → 3014.36] Is not the way
[3014.36 → 3015.14] He has worked
[3015.14 → 3015.90] In different ways
[3015.90 → 3016.96] And at different times
[3016.96 → 3018.24] In history
[3018.24 → 3020.58] But that he is
[3020.58 → 3021.30] Our Lord
[3021.30 → 3022.98] He is the same Lord
[3022.98 → 3023.62] Who has healed
[3023.62 → 3024.70] All of us
[3024.70 → 3026.56] Our one Lord
[3026.56 → 3028.96] So what else
[3028.96 → 3029.72] Is there one of
[3029.72 → 3031.74] One faith
[3031.74 → 3035.18] Now this can mean
[3035.18 → 3036.88] Your personal
[3036.88 → 3037.76] Subjective faith
[3037.76 → 3038.84] Like this is how I feel
[3038.84 → 3039.60] About my relationship
[3039.60 → 3040.12] With God
[3040.12 → 3041.80] But more likely
[3041.80 → 3042.52] Paul here
[3042.52 → 3043.80] Is talking about
[3043.80 → 3045.48] An objective faith
[3045.48 → 3047.10] Like our confession
[3047.10 → 3049.54] What we believe
[3049.54 → 3050.92] The gospel of truth
[3050.92 → 3052.14] The gospel of our salvation
[3052.14 → 3052.78] He uses all these
[3052.78 → 3053.42] Different terms
[3053.42 → 3054.04] In the book
[3054.04 → 3056.26] So we as Christians
[3056.26 → 3057.86] Should have a single faith
[3057.86 → 3059.54] It's not each of us
[3059.54 → 3060.30] Having our own
[3060.30 → 3060.86] Conceptions
[3060.86 → 3062.30] About who God is
[3062.30 → 3062.74] And what it means
[3062.74 → 3063.44] To follow him
[3063.44 → 3064.14] But it's about
[3064.14 → 3065.12] What God has revealed
[3065.12 → 3065.90] To us
[3065.90 → 3067.22] And it isn't
[3067.22 → 3067.90] A blessing
[3067.90 → 3069.10] That he has given us
[3069.10 → 3069.70] His word
[3069.70 → 3071.48] And if you want to know
[3071.48 → 3072.80] What to believe about God
[3072.80 → 3073.92] Look in his word
[3073.92 → 3075.28] Measure everything
[3075.28 → 3076.32] By the scriptures
[3076.32 → 3079.38] Yes we can make mistakes
[3079.38 → 3081.10] In our understanding
[3081.10 → 3082.10] Of the Bible
[3082.10 → 3084.02] And yes there are
[3084.02 → 3085.18] Primary doctrines
[3085.18 → 3085.66] And there are
[3085.66 → 3086.80] Secondary doctrines
[3086.80 → 3088.44] But our goal
[3088.44 → 3090.60] Is like-mindedness
[3090.60 → 3092.04] Not of the sort
[3092.04 → 3092.84] Where we agree
[3092.84 → 3094.60] Not to talk about
[3094.60 → 3095.52] Certain things
[3095.52 → 3096.82] But we are all
[3096.82 → 3097.98] Equally pursuing
[3097.98 → 3099.24] God's truth
[3099.24 → 3099.90] Not our own
[3099.90 → 3100.54] Conceptions
[3100.54 → 3102.38] Where we each
[3102.38 → 3103.22] Have our own idea
[3103.22 → 3104.00] And we all do
[3104.00 → 3104.98] What is good
[3104.98 → 3105.78] In our own sight
[3105.78 → 3106.62] Which leads to
[3106.62 → 3107.48] Not unity
[3107.48 → 3109.50] But we want to know
[3109.50 → 3110.28] What God says
[3110.28 → 3111.32] And we want
[3111.32 → 3112.50] One faith
[3112.50 → 3113.76] And that is why
[3113.76 → 3114.54] In our tradition
[3114.54 → 3115.60] The Reformed church
[3115.60 → 3117.02] We write it down
[3117.02 → 3117.80] Right?
[3117.86 → 3118.72] We have a confession
[3118.72 → 3119.32] Of faith
[3119.32 → 3120.82] And it's written down
[3120.82 → 3121.46] So you know
[3121.46 → 3122.50] What you're going to get
[3122.50 → 3124.00] And if you become
[3124.00 → 3125.12] A leader in the church
[3125.12 → 3126.08] A minister of the word
[3126.08 → 3126.62] Or an elder
[3126.62 → 3127.44] Or a deacon
[3127.44 → 3128.74] We are expected
[3128.74 → 3129.58] To be consistent
[3129.58 → 3131.58] With that confession
[3131.58 → 3134.20] The Holy Spirit
[3134.20 → 3135.42] Brings all Christians
[3135.42 → 3136.22] To the belief
[3136.22 → 3137.28] Of certain things
[3137.28 → 3139.42] Okay now
[3139.42 → 3140.36] We're nearing the end
[3140.36 → 3141.56] What else
[3141.56 → 3142.50] Is there one of?
[3143.22 → 3144.08] We have one Lord
[3144.08 → 3144.86] One faith
[3144.86 → 3146.94] And one baptism
[3146.94 → 3148.66] Now this is
[3148.66 → 3149.58] This is important
[3149.58 → 3150.00] As well
[3150.00 → 3151.28] You know
[3151.28 → 3151.64] We're going to have
[3151.64 → 3152.64] Some baptisms today
[3152.64 → 3154.26] After the service
[3154.26 → 3155.66] What is baptism?
[3155.66 → 3157.00] You know
[3157.00 → 3157.96] And many people
[3157.96 → 3159.28] Define baptism
[3159.28 → 3161.12] As a personal sign
[3161.12 → 3161.82] That they
[3161.82 → 3162.90] Have come to faith
[3162.90 → 3163.58] You know
[3163.58 → 3164.54] That's what it's all about
[3164.54 → 3165.54] My faith
[3165.54 → 3167.34] And that's not
[3167.34 → 3168.32] Wrong
[3168.32 → 3169.78] It's just incomplete
[3169.78 → 3172.28] Baptism in the scriptures
[3172.28 → 3172.84] Is something
[3172.84 → 3174.22] Of a social marker
[3174.22 → 3175.52] To show that
[3175.52 → 3177.00] You are in the church
[3177.00 → 3178.24] Right?
[3178.30 → 3180.22] Baptism is the entry point
[3180.22 → 3182.52] Into the covenant community
[3182.52 → 3183.74] To belong
[3183.74 → 3185.08] And so
[3185.08 → 3186.20] All who are baptized
[3186.20 → 3187.26] Are recognized
[3187.26 → 3188.38] As church members
[3188.38 → 3190.48] We are covenant members
[3190.48 → 3193.58] And if you are not yet baptized
[3193.58 → 3196.16] It isn't that we don't like you
[3196.16 → 3198.38] It's just that you haven't joined yet
[3198.38 → 3199.98] You're still welcome
[3199.98 → 3201.68] But you're not part of the church
[3201.68 → 3202.86] You're not in
[3202.86 → 3204.12] So in this way
[3204.12 → 3206.20] Baptism is sort of a dividing line
[3206.20 → 3207.30] Of the church
[3207.30 → 3209.90] And there is only one baptism
[3209.90 → 3212.78] It's either a Christian baptism
[3212.78 → 3214.18] Or it's not
[3214.18 → 3216.44] And so we accept
[3216.44 → 3217.76] All baptisms
[3217.76 → 3218.36] Done
[3218.36 → 3219.78] In the name of the Father
[3219.78 → 3220.54] And of the Son
[3220.54 → 3221.30] And of the Holy Spirit
[3221.30 → 3222.50] Whether you come from
[3222.50 → 3223.62] A Roman Catholic background
[3223.62 → 3224.94] Or a Lutheran background
[3224.94 → 3225.98] Or a Baptist background
[3225.98 → 3228.56] Because we all share
[3228.56 → 3229.92] The faith in one gospel
[3229.92 → 3231.16] We belong to one body
[3231.16 → 3232.20] And there is one baptism
[3232.20 → 3233.98] We don't require you
[3233.98 → 3234.90] To be baptized again
[3234.90 → 3236.00] When you come to our church
[3236.00 → 3237.64] There's one baptism
[3237.64 → 3240.90] And the last one
[3240.90 → 3243.22] One God
[3243.22 → 3245.66] And Father of all
[3245.66 → 3247.06] Who is over all
[3247.06 → 3248.00] And through all
[3248.00 → 3249.06] And in all
[3249.06 → 3251.24] Christian unity
[3251.24 → 3252.06] Ultimately
[3252.06 → 3253.98] Is an after effect
[3253.98 → 3256.32] Of who God is
[3256.32 → 3259.42] We have one God
[3259.42 → 3261.30] In the persons
[3261.30 → 3261.94] Of the Father
[3261.94 → 3262.30] Son
[3262.30 → 3263.04] And Holy Spirit
[3263.04 → 3264.80] And because God himself
[3264.80 → 3267.14] Is a Trinity
[3267.14 → 3268.16] Three in one
[3268.16 → 3268.98] One in three
[3268.98 → 3270.88] And you can no more
[3270.88 → 3272.16] Split the persons
[3272.16 → 3273.48] Of the Trinity
[3273.48 → 3274.88] Apart from one another
[3274.88 → 3275.64] Than you can split
[3275.64 → 3276.66] The unity of the body
[3276.66 → 3277.52] Of Christ apart
[3277.52 → 3280.70] So there are seven
[3280.70 → 3282.34] Ones here
[3282.34 → 3283.74] And this friends
[3283.74 → 3284.64] Is the basis
[3284.64 → 3285.78] It is the foundation
[3285.78 → 3286.66] Of our unity
[3286.66 → 3287.48] With one another
[3287.48 → 3289.56] The unity of the body
[3289.56 → 3290.12] Of Christ
[3290.12 → 3291.64] Is something that God
[3291.64 → 3292.32] Does
[3292.32 → 3293.62] God does all of this
[3293.62 → 3295.84] And we just enter into it
[3295.84 → 3296.58] We receive it
[3296.58 → 3299.08] We are in the Father's book
[3299.08 → 3302.10] We are in the Son's salvation
[3302.10 → 3302.92] By his blood
[3302.92 → 3304.60] The Spirit is in us
[3304.60 → 3306.62] Pointing us to Christ
[3306.62 → 3307.86] Calling us to repentance
[3307.86 → 3309.54] And we belong to him
[3309.54 → 3311.48] This is what God does
[3311.48 → 3312.48] In each one of our lives
[3312.48 → 3313.66] And he unites us
[3313.66 → 3315.10] Not only to him in faith
[3315.10 → 3316.42] But he unites us together
[3316.42 → 3318.04] As the body of Christ
[3318.04 → 3319.88] And I love this glimpse
[3319.88 → 3321.22] Of the unity of the church
[3321.22 → 3322.76] In the book of Revelation
[3322.76 → 3323.76] Chapter 7
[3323.76 → 3325.56] It says this
[3325.56 → 3326.48] After this I looked
[3326.48 → 3327.64] And there was before me
[3327.64 → 3330.30] And there before me
[3330.30 → 3331.84] Was a great multitude
[3331.84 → 3333.34] That no one could count
[3333.34 → 3334.50] From every nation
[3334.50 → 3334.92] Tribe
[3334.92 → 3335.32] People
[3335.32 → 3335.94] And language
[3335.94 → 3337.74] Standing before the throne
[3337.74 → 3338.80] And before
[3338.80 → 3340.04] The Lamb
[3340.04 → 3342.08] They were wearing
[3342.08 → 3343.16] White robes
[3343.16 → 3344.16] And were holding
[3344.16 → 3344.82] Palm branches
[3344.82 → 3345.58] In their hands
[3345.58 → 3346.80] And they cried out
[3346.80 → 3347.64] In a loud voice
[3347.64 → 3349.26] Salvation belongs
[3349.26 → 3350.10] To our God
[3350.10 → 3351.20] Who sits on the throne
[3351.20 → 3352.28] And to the Lamb
[3352.28 → 3354.34] Friends
[3354.34 → 3355.12] That's what we have
[3355.12 → 3355.82] To look forward to
[3355.82 → 3357.92] But our unity
[3357.92 → 3358.70] As the church
[3358.70 → 3359.42] It doesn't just
[3359.42 → 3360.90] Start when we get there
[3360.90 → 3362.30] It starts here
[3362.30 → 3364.96] And as we live together
[3364.96 → 3366.76] There are going to be
[3366.76 → 3367.88] Bumps along the road
[3367.88 → 3370.20] As we live together
[3370.20 → 3372.62] There's going to be
[3372.62 → 3373.20] Some collisions
[3373.20 → 3374.26] Perhaps
[3374.26 → 3375.44] And that's why
[3375.44 → 3376.16] Paul says
[3376.16 → 3377.24] In verses 2 to 3
[3377.24 → 3378.04] And we're not going to
[3378.04 → 3379.18] Don't have time
[3379.18 → 3380.06] To get into it
[3380.06 → 3380.82] Too much now
[3380.82 → 3381.62] But this is what
[3381.62 → 3382.20] Paul says
[3382.20 → 3384.24] Be completely humble
[3384.24 → 3384.82] And gentle
[3384.82 → 3386.40] Be patient
[3386.40 → 3388.30] Bearing with one another
[3388.30 → 3388.88] In love
[3388.88 → 3390.58] Make every effort
[3390.58 → 3391.68] To keep the unity
[3391.68 → 3392.48] Of the spirit
[3392.48 → 3393.98] Through the bond of peace
[3393.98 → 3395.98] Paul is saying
[3395.98 → 3397.24] The way we live
[3397.24 → 3398.10] As a Christian
[3398.10 → 3399.26] Will affect
[3399.26 → 3401.42] Our unity of the church
[3401.42 → 3403.36] The way each one of us
[3403.36 → 3404.36] Lives as a Christian
[3404.36 → 3405.18] Will affect
[3405.18 → 3407.10] The unity of the church
[3407.10 → 3409.22] So this is a call
[3409.22 → 3411.12] To pursue unity
[3411.12 → 3413.88] We as the people of God
[3413.88 → 3415.70] Must live together in love
[3415.70 → 3417.18] We need to be
[3417.18 → 3418.84] A community of peace
[3418.84 → 3420.72] And this is not
[3420.72 → 3422.18] Going to come easily
[3422.18 → 3423.52] It's not going to
[3423.52 → 3424.30] Come naturally
[3424.30 → 3426.28] But it will come
[3426.28 → 3427.20] By God's grace
[3427.20 → 3428.20] Through his spirit
[3428.20 → 3429.52] As he builds
[3429.52 → 3430.26] Us
[3430.26 → 3431.56] To be the household
[3431.56 → 3432.10] Of God
[3432.10 → 3433.80] Would you please
[3433.80 → 3434.54] Join me in prayer
[3434.54 → 3438.36] Our Father and our God
[3438.36 → 3439.08] We look at what
[3439.08 → 3439.72] You are doing
[3439.72 → 3440.36] In the world
[3440.36 → 3441.06] And we marvel
[3441.06 → 3443.56] We marvel
[3443.56 → 3444.84] About this
[3444.84 → 3446.26] New humanity
[3446.26 → 3447.54] That you are creating
[3447.54 → 3449.90] Men and women
[3449.90 → 3451.14] Jew
[3451.14 → 3452.78] And Gentiles
[3452.78 → 3453.76] From all over the world
[3453.76 → 3456.38] Different economic classes
[3456.38 → 3457.54] Different languages
[3457.54 → 3458.06] But Lord
[3458.06 → 3459.00] But you have made us
[3459.00 → 3460.12] One
[3460.12 → 3462.06] Because you are one
[3462.06 → 3463.88] And this is a unity
[3463.88 → 3464.88] That you are creating
[3464.88 → 3465.50] That we could
[3465.50 → 3466.40] Never break
[3466.40 → 3467.54] We could never create
[3467.54 → 3470.30] Lord help us to
[3470.30 → 3471.58] Receive
[3471.58 → 3472.90] What you have given us
[3472.90 → 3473.52] And Lord
[3473.52 → 3474.36] To live it out
[3474.36 → 3475.68] To pursue it
[3475.68 → 3476.66] To
[3476.66 → 3477.22] To
[3477.22 → 3478.70] Exercise it
[3478.70 → 3479.76] And make it manifest
[3479.76 → 3481.14] And visible in this world
[3481.14 → 3482.08] For your glory
[3482.08 → 3484.24] And the good of your church
[3484.24 → 3486.02] We pray in Jesus name
[3486.02 → 3486.90] Amen
[3486.90 → 3490.54] Would you please stand
[3490.54 → 3491.18] And we'll sing
[3491.18 → 3492.12] Our song of response
[3492.12 → 3492.46] It's called
[3492.46 → 3493.32] God is here
[3493.32 → 3494.42] As we his people
[3494.42 → 3496.80] The words may be unfamiliar
[3496.80 → 3497.86] But it's to the tune
[3497.86 → 3498.76] Of come thou found
[3498.76 → 3500.20] So you can sing it along
[3500.20 → 3513.12] God is here
[3513.12 → 3515.62] As we all people
[3515.62 → 3517.70] Lead to offer
[3517.70 → 3519.96] Praise and prayer
[3519.96 → 3522.76] May we find him
[3522.76 → 3523.76] Full or measure
[3524.46 → 3527.50] What it is in Christ
[3527.50 → 3528.86] We share
[3528.86 → 3530.92] He has done
[3530.92 → 3533.66] The world around us
[3533.66 → 3537.88] For bear in skills and arts
[3537.88 → 3540.26] We can come
[3540.26 → 3542.66] He has a spirit
[3542.66 → 3547.50] Into all my minds and hearts
[3548.08 → 3551.24] Here are symbols
[3551.24 → 3553.74] To remind us
[3553.74 → 3555.56] Of our life
[3555.56 → 3558.24] Of need of grace
[3558.24 → 3560.54] Hear our table
[3560.54 → 3562.82] Font and prophet
[3562.82 → 3565.06] Hear their cross
[3565.06 → 3567.50] That central place
[3567.50 → 3570.38] Hear in honesty
[3570.38 → 3571.94] And preaching
[3571.94 → 3574.18] Hear in silence
[3574.18 → 3576.42] Granting space
[3576.42 → 3579.50] Hear in newness
[3579.50 → 3580.74] And renewal
[3580.74 → 3583.50] God the spirit
[3583.50 → 3585.18] Comes to lead
[3585.18 → 3589.24] Lord of all
[3589.24 → 3591.56] Of church and kingdom
[3591.56 → 3594.90] In an age of change
[3594.90 → 3596.18] And doubt
[3596.18 → 3598.16] He must faithful
[3598.16 → 3600.64] To the gospel
[3600.64 → 3602.58] Help us work
[3602.58 → 3605.04] Your purpose out
[3605.04 → 3607.18] Fear he lives
[3607.18 → 3609.54] Is dedication
[3609.54 → 3611.72] All we have
[3611.72 → 3612.88] To give
[3612.88 → 3614.08] Receive
[3614.08 → 3616.56] We who cannot
[3616.56 → 3619.10] Live without you
[3619.10 → 3621.68] We adore you
[3621.68 → 3622.98] We believe
[3622.98 → 3636.94] So we continue to
[3636.94 → 3638.30] Worship the Lord
[3638.30 → 3639.38] With the giving of our
[3639.38 → 3640.02] Tithes and offerings
[3640.02 → 3641.02] And it really is a
[3641.02 → 3642.28] Continuance of our worship
[3642.28 → 3644.00] In worship we
[3644.00 → 3645.34] We receive
[3645.34 → 3647.26] But we also respond
[3647.26 → 3648.44] And one of the ways
[3648.44 → 3649.24] That we can respond
[3649.24 → 3650.86] Is by the giving
[3650.86 → 3652.58] Of what we have
[3652.58 → 3653.44] Acknowledging that
[3653.44 → 3654.90] All that we have

[3682.90 → 3683.72] To
[3683.72 → 3684.60] begin
[3684.60 → 3684.80] A
[3684.80 → 3684.90] Day

[3769.76 → 3775.08] So we now come to a time of prayers of the people or a prayer for our community.
[3775.76 → 3780.52] It's a prayer of supplication where we ask God, call upon him.
[3780.60 → 3782.52] We ask him to meet our needs.
[3783.70 → 3785.72] So would you join me in prayer?
[3786.24 → 3786.96] Let's pray together.
[3789.26 → 3791.34] Lord, we pray to you.
[3791.34 → 3794.06] Lord, we pray to you, our God and creator.
[3794.86 → 3799.42] Who else have we to turn to but you, the God of heaven and earth?
[3799.94 → 3803.42] You number the stars and our days.
[3805.72 → 3808.94] Lord, we pray for the unrest of this world, the disunity.
[3810.20 → 3815.02] We pray that you would help us to be an agent, to reconcile people to you.
[3816.02 → 3819.32] Please work in the hearts and minds of the people of this fallen world
[3819.32 → 3825.06] and bring true peace, which can only come from a right relationship with you
[3825.06 → 3827.12] by your grace through our Lord Jesus.
[3828.72 → 3830.36] And Lord, we lift our church.
[3831.38 → 3836.46] Help us to be a faithful community, holding fast to the truths of scripture,
[3837.16 → 3842.32] the one faith, building real community in the one body that you have given us.
[3842.32 → 3848.04] Lord, help us to build true relationships because we are your people.
[3849.12 → 3855.98] Lord, help us to serve the world around us as the arms and feet, the hands and feet of Jesus.
[3857.26 → 3863.98] Help us to focus each week on being your people, of being intentional about praying to you,
[3863.98 → 3869.28] of reading your word, of reaching out and serving others,
[3870.34 → 3876.06] and Lord, in encouraging and building each other up in our Christian walks.
[3877.28 → 3882.30] Lord, we thank you for the good works that you have prepared in advance for us to do.
[3882.82 → 3885.96] Lord, the work of walking closely with you,
[3886.84 → 3890.42] of following your commands and instructions,
[3890.42 → 3893.52] of living according to your spirit,
[3893.64 → 3895.82] that we might grow in all the fruit of the spirit.
[3897.54 → 3901.36] And Lord, we pray especially this morning for the DeVos family.
[3902.74 → 3907.76] Please comfort them who mourn for the loss of Ingrid,
[3908.56 → 3910.46] a daughter-in-law, a sister-in-law.
[3911.32 → 3914.06] Lord, help them through this difficult time and be near to them,
[3914.52 → 3917.48] that they may know the love that you have for them.
[3917.48 → 3922.64] Father, we pray also for those in our church family
[3922.64 → 3926.06] who are suffering from illness and health issues.
[3927.96 → 3931.00] We pray for those who are downcast in spirit.
[3932.36 → 3937.20] And Lord, please revive them,
[3937.58 → 3942.06] all who need you, Lord, physically or emotionally, spiritually.
[3942.64 → 3944.98] Lord, lift them up by your gracious hand.
[3944.98 → 3948.56] Be near to those also, Lord, who are alone
[3948.56 → 3953.80] or shut in or unable to be with their church family.
[3957.28 → 3960.88] And Lord, we now pray together the Lord's Prayer.
[3960.88 → 3963.78] Our Father who art in heaven,
[3964.56 → 3965.88] hallowed be thy name.
[3966.56 → 3967.68] Thy kingdom come.
[3968.30 → 3971.60] Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[3972.26 → 3974.40] Give us this day our daily bread
[3974.40 → 3977.98] and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[3978.56 → 3980.38] And lead us not into temptation,
[3981.08 → 3982.70] but deliver us from evil.
[3983.14 → 3987.22] For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[3987.92 → 3988.34] Amen.
[3988.34 → 3991.00] Brothers and sisters, I invite you to stand.
[3991.90 → 3994.22] And as we prepare to go out,
[3994.30 → 3996.70] we go with the Lord's blessings upon us.
[3996.76 → 3997.68] And just another reminder,
[3997.88 → 3998.94] after the worship service,
[3999.00 → 4001.02] you are invited into our fellowship hall
[4001.02 → 4002.30] for cake and coffee,
[4002.94 → 4005.10] to greet and meet one another,
[4005.66 → 4006.88] to say happy birthday to Ted.
[4007.64 → 4010.38] And we will then hopefully see many of you
[4010.38 → 4012.18] at the Hamming's Farm for the baptisms.
[4012.18 → 4014.86] So I invite you to hold out your hands
[4014.86 → 4018.74] as a gesture of receiving from the Father,
[4019.56 → 4021.50] your Heavenly Father and your Creator.
[4022.06 → 4023.86] May our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4024.30 → 4026.14] who pray that we would be one,
[4026.88 → 4028.88] even as he and the Father are one,
[4029.64 → 4031.08] so grace you with his spirit,
[4031.92 → 4034.04] that you may grow in grace and fellowship
[4034.04 → 4036.68] and discover joy in walking together
[4036.68 → 4038.56] as part of Christ's body,
[4039.20 → 4042.10] so that the world may know of God's love for us
[4042.10 → 4043.32] in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4044.10 → 4044.42] Amen.
[4046.32 → 4047.34] Please remain standing,
[4047.46 → 4048.62] and we'll sing our final song.
[4048.62 → 4052.40] As we sing this song this morning,
[4052.50 → 4053.68] we were going to sing it twice,
[4053.80 → 4054.10] but you know,
[4054.20 → 4055.24] I think it would be really nice
[4055.24 → 4056.28] if we sang it once,
[4056.36 → 4058.18] and then as we sing it the second time,
[4058.26 → 4059.54] we walk out singing it.
[4059.74 → 4061.70] So as soon as we've sung it one time,
[4061.80 → 4062.62] start walking out
[4062.62 → 4063.96] and just sing it on your way out, okay?
[4063.96 → 4082.54] My friends, may you flow in grace,
[4082.54 → 4088.08] and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[4088.08 → 4095.18] My friends, may you flow in grace,
[4095.18 → 4101.66] and the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4102.04 → 4104.76] To God be the glory,
[4105.90 → 4107.50] now and forever,
[4108.42 → 4111.96] now and forever, amen.
[4111.96 → 4116.78] To God be the glory,
[4117.94 → 4119.50] now and forever,
[4120.50 → 4123.96] now and forever, amen.
[4123.96 → 4130.96] My friends, may you flow in grace,
[4131.98 → 4136.70] and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[4136.70 → 4143.70] My friends, may you flow in grace,
[4143.70 → 4150.00] and the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4150.00 → 4153.32] To God be the glory,
[4154.08 → 4156.08] now and forever,
[4157.08 → 4160.66] now and forever, amen.
[4162.72 → 4165.60] To God be the glory,
[4165.60 → 4168.50] now and forever,
[4168.50 → 4172.60] now and forever, amen.
[4172.60 → 4177.70] To God be the glory,
[4177.70 → 4177.74] now and forever,
[4177.74 → 4184.60] now and forever, amen.
[4184.60 → 4189.60] To God be the glory,
[4189.60 → 4192.42] now and forever,
[4192.42 → 4196.74] now and forever, amen.
