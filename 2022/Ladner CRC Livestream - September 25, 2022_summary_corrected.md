• The church is a blended community that demonstrates the logic of grace by forgiving one another as Christ has forgiven them
• Christians are naturally enemies who love each other for Jesus' sake
• Walking in the way of love requires following God's example, as mentioned in Ephesians 4 and 5.
• Paul lists various vices and virtues in his passage, but they are not random; instead, they illustrate how we either build or destroy community through our actions.
• The vices include nursing anger (resentment) and focusing on the flaws of others, which can lead to bitterness and hurt relationships.
• Resentment is a form of anger that refuses to give someone else grace in their failures and leads to refusal to reconcile with others.
• Paul warns against letting resentment fester by saying "do not let the sun go down while you are still angry" because it gives the devil an opportunity to encourage sin and damage community.
• Habits of anger and resentment can destroy community
• Taking advantage of others' generosity is also destructive to community
• Speaking harm through unwholesome talk or slander corrupts relationships
• Paul calls for the removal of bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, and malice from the church
• God sees us with compassion in our sin and frees us from the need to criticize or judge others.
• The church is called to be a community that puts on compassion and bears witness to the life of God through putting on habits of compassion.
• The three habits of compassion are:
  • Nursing forgiveness: actively forgiving one another as Christ forgave us
  • Giving advantage: using our gifts and abilities for the well-being of others, rather than just ourselves
  • Speaking grace: building up others with words that bestow dignity and benediction
• The importance of learning to speak words of encouragement and building others up
• Jesus' example of speaking words of compassion rather than criticism or condemnation
• The need to practice speaking with love and compassion in our interactions with others
• Overcoming vices such as anger, bitterness, and taking advantage of others
• Practicing virtues such as forgiveness, giving, and speaking words of grace
• Applying these principles to our own lives by identifying areas where we need to forgive or serve others
