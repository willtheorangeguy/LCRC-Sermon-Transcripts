[3819.38 --> 3820.62]  You.
[3849.38 --> 3856.60]  wipe away every tear from our eyes. We struggle through life under the curse of death and pain,
[3856.76 --> 3863.96]  but God will make all things new. And our world is broken, but God promises in the end to make
[3863.96 --> 3871.36]  all things well. God has taken the bad news and overwhelmed it with good news. And it's this good
[3871.36 --> 3878.58]  news that gives us great comfort and great hope today. Thanks be to God. Let's pray together.
[3879.38 --> 3888.52]  Heavenly Father, in Jesus Christ, your Son, you promised that we will live and dwell with you,
[3889.06 --> 3896.44]  the lover of our souls forever in glory. Give us faith to see beyond touch and sight,
[3897.08 --> 3903.56]  a vision of the heavenly city. And when our vision fails, Lord, in this life, help us to trust your
[3903.56 --> 3911.02]  loving promises which never fail. We pray that you would look down in tender love upon your children
[3911.02 --> 3916.76]  who mourn. Strengthen and comfort them according to the multitude of your mercies,
[3916.76 --> 3926.10]  so that they may find in you their strength and their refuge. And Lord, would you help us to look
[3926.10 --> 3931.72]  forward with glad hearts to that happy reunion, the marriage supper of the Lamb, when all of your
[3931.72 --> 3938.70]  people will be gathered into your kingdom to live with you and one another in peace and in joy forever.
[3939.52 --> 3943.58]  It is through Jesus Christ, our Lord, that we pray. Amen.
[3943.58 --> 3954.04]  Amen. So please rise and let's sing together the song, God is our refuge and our strength.
[3954.04 --> 3954.44]  Amen.

[4115.04 --> 4122.04]  You may remain standing, and would you just join me in prayer before we depart.
[4123.66 --> 4128.76]  Father of mercies and God of all comfort, you are our refuge in times of trouble.
[4129.54 --> 4131.24]  You are our light in the darkness.
[4132.28 --> 4135.34]  You are our only hope in the face of death.
[4136.36 --> 4142.58]  Help us to believe and trust that your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by dying has destroyed
[4142.58 --> 4146.36]  our death, and by rising has restored our life.
[4147.74 --> 4154.32]  Deepen our trust that neither death nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
[4154.32 --> 4160.86]  anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from your love in Christ Jesus,
[4161.26 --> 4161.82]  our Lord.
[4162.84 --> 4169.22]  We pray in the name of your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit, one God,
[4169.92 --> 4171.00]  now and forever.
[4172.10 --> 4172.52]  Amen.
[4172.58 --> 4175.62]  I've received this benediction.
[4176.98 --> 4181.78]  And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the fellowship
[4181.78 --> 4183.90]  of the Holy Spirit be upon you all.
[4184.46 --> 4190.06]  And may the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding, guard your hearts and minds
[4190.06 --> 4191.30]  in Christ Jesus.
[4192.12 --> 4192.44]  Amen.

[4413.66 --> 4420.04]  to the back of the church and will help you with that.
[4420.04 --> 4427.72]  The family will be gathering in the foyer for a few minutes and certainly remain there
[4427.72 --> 4436.04]  for a few minutes for a time where those of you who would like to or wish to offer their
[4436.04 --> 4440.00]  condolences may and can do so.
[4440.00 --> 4447.88]  The family would also ask that if you haven't signed the guest book, if you would do that
[4447.88 --> 4455.26]  at this time on leaving, and please take an opportunity if you haven't already, look at
[4455.26 --> 4463.92]  some of the tables that are set out with some of the things that we can remember CORE with.
[4463.92 --> 4473.30]  The family will leave in a short while to attend to a private family graveside burial service
[4473.30 --> 4477.22]  at Boundary Bay Cemetery.
