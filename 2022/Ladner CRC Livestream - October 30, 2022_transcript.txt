[232.00 --> 236.00]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[236.00 --> 238.00]  Good morning.
[238.00 --> 243.36]  on this very rainy day. Someone asked, is it raining in Richmond? I will report that yes.
[243.90 --> 251.10]  It is raining in Richmond as well, as Ladner. I want to extend a warm welcome to you, especially
[251.10 --> 257.44]  if this is your first time here. And we are very glad that you are joining us this morning.
[257.44 --> 269.30]  So it was about 500 years ago that a young German monk walked away from his monastery and he crossed
[269.30 --> 275.94]  the city where he lived and came to what was called the Castle Church. And the door of that
[275.94 --> 289.42]  church served as kind of a public bulletin board. And he nailed 95 statements or 95 theses
[289.42 --> 296.76]  about the true Christian religion. And the reason why he did this was to invite public debate.
[297.68 --> 303.32]  And of course, the person I am talking about is Martin Luther. And that event, as much as any
[303.32 --> 309.46]  other, really ignited what we call the Protestant Reformation. And the reason why it's so important
[309.46 --> 316.92]  for us to know that is that we stand in that tradition, right? There's continuity between
[316.92 --> 324.34]  what happened 500 years ago and who we are and what we believe today. And the point is that we
[324.34 --> 329.94]  are part of a long history. Actually, we're part of a history that goes back not only 500 years,
[329.94 --> 337.78]  but that is rooted in the Bible. Part of what the Reformation reminded us is that we need to go
[337.78 --> 348.12]  back to God's Word. The center of our faith, the center of our religion is Jesus Christ and how we can
[348.12 --> 357.54]  become right before God. And that is the preeminent truth that we all need to pursue. And that's what we
[357.54 --> 365.64]  are doing here today. We're here to worship God and to experience the life that we have with our
[365.64 --> 371.84]  Heavenly Father. So before we begin our worship service, there are just two quick announcements.
[373.02 --> 380.04]  Our, hopefully you saw some slides as you came in, but we are having a hymn sing. I didn't bring my
[380.04 --> 384.28]  bulletin up with me. But if you look in your bulletins, there are a bunch of announcements. One is a
[384.28 --> 389.64]  hymn sing is coming up, I think in two Sundays. Right now I'm going to get it wrong and you're not
[389.64 --> 396.02]  going to come. When is it? Next Sunday. Okay, next Sunday. I like this crowd participation. At what
[396.02 --> 402.68]  time? Seven. Okay, so next Sunday, seven o'clock. Come and we're just going to open our hymns and we're
[402.68 --> 408.38]  just going to sing a lot of old favorite hymns. That would be a lot of fun. And then also we are having
[408.38 --> 415.00]  a membership class. We'll be doing a membership class for three weeks in November. So this is for
[415.00 --> 421.74]  anyone who is not yet an official member of the church. So maybe you've been coming a long time.
[422.34 --> 427.38]  And in our church, we have this phrase, we call you friends of the congregation. That means you've
[427.38 --> 434.52]  been coming a long time. You're really part of the life of the church, but not fully members. And so,
[434.52 --> 438.26]  but also we have people who are maybe new and who have started coming just recently.
[438.96 --> 446.50]  So this class is to introduce you to our church, what we believe, how we operate, our governance,
[447.10 --> 454.40]  our confessions. And also this will lead to an opportunity for you to then apply to become a
[454.40 --> 458.86]  member. So you don't have to become a member taking this class. You could just take it in order to learn
[458.86 --> 465.46]  more about who we are, but it is required if you want to become an official member. So please consider
[465.46 --> 474.30]  joining this class and sign up on the foyer table. So let's prepare our hearts now to come before the
[474.30 --> 481.80]  Lord in worship. In the Bible, God calls us to worship because it's not our natural impulse
[481.80 --> 488.80]  to come before God and worship him. So he calls us. He reminds us of his pursuing love.
[489.52 --> 497.52]  And then we respond in gratitude and obedience. Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 148.
[498.50 --> 500.24]  We'll say this responsibly.
[500.24 --> 530.22]  Praise the Lord.
[530.22 --> 560.20]  And he has raised up for the Lord.
[560.20 --> 565.16]  Praise for his people, a horn. Praise for his saints, Israel.
[565.88 --> 569.70]  The people close to his heart. Praise the Lord.
[570.90 --> 576.84]  Would you please join me now as we come before this Lord in a prayer of adoration. Let's pray together.
[579.02 --> 582.24]  Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
[583.08 --> 588.68]  Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world.
[588.68 --> 592.44]  From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[592.44 --> 598.34]  So teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[598.34 --> 607.24]  Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all of our days.
[607.24 --> 613.78]  Let your work be shown to us, your servants, and your glorious power to our children.
[614.78 --> 618.96]  Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and establish the work of our hands.
[619.46 --> 621.84]  Yes, Lord, establish the work of our hands.
[621.84 --> 629.62]  And we come before you this morning, Father, Son, and Spirit, with grateful hearts and with joyful worship.
[630.58 --> 637.10]  Would you teach us, instruct us, meet with us so that we can say that we have met with you this morning.
[637.10 --> 644.48]  And now, Lord, would you unite our hearts to be able to sing and praise to you and acknowledge who you are.
[645.04 --> 648.42]  And we pray in your Son's name. Amen.
[649.78 --> 652.80]  Please rise in body or in spirit as you are able.
[653.12 --> 657.78]  Our call, our greeting this morning is the Gloria Patri.
[658.24 --> 659.42]  And I want us to sing it.
[659.96 --> 661.34]  I told Paul right at the last minute.
[662.14 --> 665.48]  So, we'll put the words up and let's sing the Gloria Patri.
[665.80 --> 667.50]  I think it's probably familiar to us.
[667.74 --> 668.22]  Let's sing.
[668.22 --> 668.26]  Let's sing.
[668.26 --> 670.26]  Let's sing.
[691.34 --> 715.54]  So, as the Lord has greeted us, let us turn and greet those around us, especially if you see someone you don't know as well.
[715.64 --> 716.32]  Please greet them.
[716.32 --> 717.32]  Let's sing.
[721.34 --> 751.32]  Let's sing.
[751.34 --> 781.32]  Let's sing.
[781.32 --> 811.30]  Let's sing.
[811.32 --> 812.32]  Let's sing.
[812.32 --> 814.32]  Let's sing.
[814.32 --> 815.32]  Let's sing.
[815.32 --> 820.16]  Who triumphed for the great
[820.16 --> 825.22]  Who rose victorious in the strife
[825.22 --> 829.88]  For those he came to save
[829.88 --> 833.82]  His glories now receive
[833.82 --> 839.36]  Who died and reigns on high
[839.36 --> 844.32]  Who died eternal life to bring
[844.32 --> 849.32]  And lives that death may die
[849.32 --> 854.68]  Thou give the Lord a flower
[854.68 --> 859.50]  He holds his hands and sun
[859.50 --> 864.28]  Rich fruits and fields above
[864.28 --> 869.20]  In beauty glorified
[869.20 --> 874.20]  The angels in the sky
[874.20 --> 879.20]  May fully hear the sigh
[879.20 --> 884.20]  But now remember, Ferdinand
[884.20 --> 888.20]  The place to be so bright
[888.20 --> 895.20]  Am I?
[895.20 --> 901.20]  Am I?
[901.20 --> 903.16]  Am I?
[903.16 --> 905.20]  Am I?
[905.20 --> 907.20]  Am I?
[907.20 --> 909.20]  Am I?
[909.20 --> 921.58]  Now is the Lord of kings, and the Lord of kings, and the Lord of kings, and the Lord of kings.
[921.58 --> 931.52]  Freedom from the full earth's feet, where the full is all bad.
[931.52 --> 941.34]  All hail Redeemer, hail the Lord of kings, and the Lord of kings are free.
[941.34 --> 950.04]  My praise shall ever give your fear through the eternity.
[971.34 --> 989.34]  You're the word of God, the Father, from before the world began.
[989.34 --> 997.48]  Every star and every planet has been fashioned by your hand.
[997.48 --> 1004.48]  All creation holds together by the power of your light.
[1004.48 --> 1011.48]  Let the skies declare your glory, let the land and seas rejoice.
[1011.48 --> 1018.48]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone.
[1018.48 --> 1026.48]  And your cry of love brings up across the land.
[1027.48 --> 1038.48]  Yet you'd left the gaze of angels, came to see and save the last.
[1038.48 --> 1045.48]  And exchange the joy of heaven for the anguish of the cross.
[1045.48 --> 1049.48]  With a prayer you fed, thou have grieved.
[1049.48 --> 1053.48]  With a word you calm the sea.
[1053.48 --> 1060.48]  Yet how silently you've suffered, yet how silently you've suffered, let the guilty make you free.
[1060.48 --> 1068.48]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of everyone.
[1068.48 --> 1075.48]  And your cry of love brings up across the land.
[1075.48 --> 1076.48]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of kings.
[1076.48 --> 1080.48]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of kings.
[1080.48 --> 1081.48]  The sh przep, yeop.
[1081.48 --> 1087.48]  With a shout you rose victorious, fetching victory from the rain.
[1087.48 --> 1094.48]  And ascended into heaven, leaning pathways in your ray.
[1094.48 --> 1102.74]  Now you stand before the Father, interceding for your home.
[1102.96 --> 1110.28]  From each tribe and tongue and nation, you are the exilus home.
[1110.56 --> 1117.74]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of every home.
[1117.74 --> 1123.52]  And your cry of love brings up across the land.
[1124.48 --> 1154.46]  You're the author of creation, you're the Lord of every home.
[1154.46 --> 1155.78]  On the other hand, you had the hymn book.
[1156.38 --> 1160.10]  And he wrote many, many solid hymns.
[1160.30 --> 1165.02]  And one that we continue to sing is A Mighty Fortress is Our God.
[1165.14 --> 1167.44]  And we will enjoy that together.
[1167.60 --> 1173.18]  And grateful today to have a visiting guest musician, Joshua Elliott.
[1173.18 --> 1177.46]  And he'll be helping us out on the organ for this song.
[1177.46 --> 1179.46]  Thank you.
[1179.46 --> 1180.46]  Thank you.
[1180.46 --> 1182.46]  Thank you.
[1182.46 --> 1183.46]  Thank you.
[1183.46 --> 1184.46]  Thank you.
[1184.46 --> 1185.46]  Thank you.
[1185.46 --> 1192.46]  Thank you.
[1192.46 --> 1194.46]  Thank you.
[1194.46 --> 1196.46]  Thank you.
[1196.46 --> 1216.98] Can lead the divineçao O density of the treasuresh O mark both nations a and as individuals
[1216.98 --> 1221.34]  Our soul, our ancient foe,
[1221.78 --> 1226.02]  does he to earth as well?
[1226.02 --> 1231.28]  His craft and power are great,
[1231.76 --> 1236.24]  and our wind through our head.
[1236.98 --> 1243.02]  On earth is not his name now.
[1243.02 --> 1249.80]  Did we in our hopes reconfire
[1249.80 --> 1254.92]  our striving would be losing?
[1256.50 --> 1261.48]  We're not the right man on our side,
[1261.90 --> 1266.56]  the man of God's own choosing.
[1267.56 --> 1272.78]  You ask who that may be,
[1273.02 --> 1277.72]  Christ Jesus, in his sea,
[1277.72 --> 1283.04]  God's lover of his name,
[1283.42 --> 1287.92]  from age to age the same,
[1288.58 --> 1294.80]  and he was in love and joy.
[1295.72 --> 1299.50]  And though this world,
[1299.50 --> 1301.50]  the devil's heroem,
[1301.50 --> 1306.64]  told him that he to come too.
[1306.64 --> 1320.50]  We will not fear, for what else is to teach my own true life.
[1320.50 --> 1334.98]  The prince of darkness came, which you have afforded, his wage we did endure.
[1336.26 --> 1347.72]  For you, please do me sure, the need you will not fail there.
[1347.72 --> 1361.96]  The word of all earth we come, all thanks to them we provided.
[1361.96 --> 1376.96]  The spirit of God is our heart, who can move with us I am.
[1377.72 --> 1387.72]  Let hands and get rid of all, his mortal life also.
[1387.72 --> 1400.72]  The body we be killed, once through the light is dead.
[1400.72 --> 1410.28]  For us is the only one who will do this.
[1410.28 --> 1416.36]  Thank you.
[1416.46 --> 1416.98]  You may be seated.
[1424.98 --> 1435.34]  So we, after having worshipped the Lord, sought his face in our singing, we come now to a
[1435.34 --> 1436.86]  time of confession.
[1436.86 --> 1441.12]  And, you know, why do we confess our sins?
[1441.18 --> 1447.66]  It's not because we want to feel particularly guilty all the time, but it's because we want
[1447.66 --> 1453.96]  to experience the grace and the forgiveness of God our Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1455.14 --> 1459.38]  And so we come and we acknowledge that God is holy and that we are not.
[1459.58 --> 1465.38]  We acknowledge that God has created us to love him and love others, and yet we fall short
[1465.38 --> 1466.62]  in these ways.
[1466.62 --> 1472.68]  And so we confess our sins, we ask for his forgiveness, and we also seek his grace to
[1472.68 --> 1476.26]  live more fully into the life that he has given us.
[1476.98 --> 1483.42]  So I want to read this passage first from Hebrews chapter 4 as a call to confession.
[1483.42 --> 1493.76]  Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus, the Son of God,
[1494.38 --> 1497.58]  let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
[1498.58 --> 1505.72]  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have
[1505.72 --> 1511.78]  one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet he did not sin.
[1511.78 --> 1525.78]  Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[1525.78 --> 1533.92]  Let us say this corporate prayer of confession together responsibly.
[1533.92 --> 1543.76]  Our exalted Lord Jesus, you poured out your Holy Spirit upon the church to fill us with new life, power, and love,
[1543.76 --> 1545.88]  with which we might serve you.
[1545.88 --> 1551.30]  We confess the times we have resisted and grieved your spirit.
[1552.50 --> 1558.80]  Forgive our closed minds when we block out your truth and wisdom.
[1559.92 --> 1566.12]  Forgive our closed eyes when we blind ourselves to needs in the world.
[1567.52 --> 1574.96]  Forgive our closed hands when we hold too closely all that you have graciously given us.
[1574.96 --> 1582.80]  Forgive our closed hearts when we limit our affections to ourselves and our own.
[1583.70 --> 1586.68]  Lord, have mercy on us and forgive us all of our sins.
[1587.48 --> 1593.16]  Open our hearts to your spirit that we may follow you in serving others.
[1593.66 --> 1594.12]  Amen.
[1595.72 --> 1598.84]  So let's acknowledge these things silently before the Lord,
[1598.84 --> 1606.08]  knowing that forgiveness and rest and grace and mercy are freely available in Jesus.
[1606.08 --> 1609.74]  Let's take a moment in the quietness of our hearts to come before him in prayer.
[1609.74 --> 1630.36]  Now hear the word of God to all who turn to God in faith.
[1631.08 --> 1634.40]  This is from Proverbs 28, our assurance of pardon.
[1634.40 --> 1639.08]  Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
[1639.58 --> 1643.32]  but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
[1643.84 --> 1647.18]  Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always.
[1649.76 --> 1657.30]  So, as the Lord has forgiven us, let's respond with song.
[1657.68 --> 1659.52]  Let's sing of God's mercy and grace.
[1659.52 --> 1662.98]  Please rise and we'll sing a song of response together.
[1668.92 --> 1675.44]  God is the good shepherd for our souls and welcomes us back to the fold when we wander.
[1676.52 --> 1680.28]  And so we'll sing this song, which has been sung here before,
[1680.42 --> 1687.68]  but we're going to just play it through the melody line once before we sing it together.
[1687.68 --> 1709.14]  .
[1709.14 --> 1711.14]  Amen.
[1739.14 --> 1769.12]  Sing it again.
[1769.14 --> 1799.12]  Sing it again.
[1799.14 --> 1801.14]  Sing it again.
[1801.14 --> 1809.14]  I find a resting place to rise refreshed and ready to follow.
[1809.14 --> 1830.82]  I'll walk this narrow road with Christ before me.
[1830.82 --> 1836.82]  Where thoughts and pieces grow and thoughts and stir me.
[1838.32 --> 1840.82]  No doubt will have denied.
[1841.96 --> 1844.82]  He never leaves my side.
[1844.82 --> 1849.82]  But leaves my head when calls me to follow.
[1849.82 --> 1870.20]  And when my days are gone, my strength is filling.
[1870.20 --> 1878.20]  He'll carry me along through glass unbilling.
[1878.20 --> 1882.20]  And struggles overcome.
[1882.20 --> 1886.20]  And I'll turn each has begun.
[1886.20 --> 1890.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1890.20 --> 1898.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1898.20 --> 1900.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1900.20 --> 1904.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1904.20 --> 1906.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1906.20 --> 1914.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1914.20 --> 1916.20]  To search Christ's steps and ever to follow.
[1916.20 --> 1932.92]  You may be seated.
[1932.92 --> 1947.34]  So the children, grade five and younger, are now invited to go to their Sunday school
[1947.34 --> 1950.12]  classes.
[1950.12 --> 1958.92]  And let us here, who are remaining, prepare our hearts to hear the reading of God's Word.
[1958.92 --> 1983.02]  Today, I'll be reading Ephesians 6, verses 5 through 9.
[1983.02 --> 1984.02]  7.
[1984.02 --> 1991.04]  Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just
[1991.04 --> 1992.42]  as you would obey Christ.
[1993.38 --> 2000.14]  Obey them, not to only win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ,
[2000.76 --> 2002.78]  doing the will of God from your heart.
[2002.78 --> 2011.16]  serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord not people because you know that the Lord
[2011.16 --> 2018.26]  will reward each one for whatever good they do whether they are slave or free and masters
[2018.26 --> 2025.40]  treat your slaves in the same way do not treat them do not threaten them since you know that he
[2025.40 --> 2032.54]  who is both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no favoritism with him this is the
[2032.54 --> 2053.00]  word of the Lord thank you Adam well good morning again I only heard like Johnny thank you Johnny
[2053.00 --> 2058.94]  maybe we'll try it later in the service okay let's pray
[2058.94 --> 2067.40]  Heavenly Father as we open your word and seek to understand what it says
[2067.40 --> 2076.88]  Father we ask that your Holy Spirit would guide us we want you to convict us and speak to us your truth
[2076.88 --> 2086.12]  and we ask it in Jesus name amen so two weeks ago I preached on a very difficult passage on marriage
[2086.12 --> 2094.22]  and last week I preached on parenting and so I am so glad today I have an easy passage on slavery
[2094.22 --> 2110.48]  the exhortation for slaves to obey their masters well it has produced a lot of consternation a lot of
[2110.48 --> 2121.28]  dismay and anxiety understandably and rightfully so since people even theologians have used it to
[2121.28 --> 2131.30]  justify the horrific slavery of Africans in such misreadings cause us to lose confidence in the Bible
[2131.30 --> 2139.46]  or to think that certain passages in the Bible are irrelevant and we just need to pass over them
[2139.46 --> 2150.44]  but I believe that today's passage actually reveals something surprisingly redemptive even revolutionary
[2150.44 --> 2160.22]  and the world still needs this revolution that we see in this passage that the Holy Spirit
[2160.22 --> 2171.62]  through the Apostle Paul begins here in this text it's a revolution that grows yes subtly slowly
[2171.62 --> 2183.20]  like a mustard seed but it is powerful and it is transformative so today we're going to focus on this redemptive
[2183.20 --> 2192.02]  revolution that Paul calls for between slaves and masters and we'll also see that these same principles
[2192.02 --> 2201.60]  apply to all of us today so now our text really is part of a larger section in the book of Ephesians
[2201.60 --> 2212.60]  beginning in chapter 5 and and moving into chapter 6 where Paul is addressing typical members of the ancient household
[2212.60 --> 2219.84]  so this is a little bit of a review but I want us to step back and see the bigger picture
[2219.84 --> 2223.12]  here okay so here is the picture
[2223.12 --> 2234.82]  it's the first century the church in Ephesus has gathered together for worship in a home
[2234.82 --> 2244.76]  someone stands up and reads out loud Paul's letter to the congregation and the amazing thing
[2244.76 --> 2257.12]  is that wives and children and slaves are present right maybe it's no big deal to us but in the first century
[2257.12 --> 2267.42]  this is a big deal why should wives and children and slaves be present in the public gathering
[2267.42 --> 2278.72]  of a worship service they have no inherent status in society many men treated them virtually as non-humans
[2278.72 --> 2289.72]  it was said that women are not really fully human that they are deformed men children were seen as potential men maybe
[2289.72 --> 2305.72]  and slaves Aristotle said are no better than tools in fact the only true humans were adult men and only free men
[2305.72 --> 2321.72]  yet there they are in the assembly wives and children and slaves you know think of the old American south they would never have slaves in a worship service
[2321.72 --> 2342.72]  they can have their own worship service if they get their work done in countries today where they still have household servants including servants in the worship service with the family part of the larger community no they can meet at another time after the work is done
[2342.72 --> 2352.72]  and when Christy and I lived in Taiwan one of the things that we discovered is that many wealthier people in Asia actually have household servants
[2352.72 --> 2364.72]  in Taiwan it was often the wealthier Taiwanese people or western expats who had servants usually from the Philippines and they would have a bedroom in the house where the servant would live
[2364.72 --> 2384.72]  and the servant would go grocery shopping and cook the food they would clean the house and watch the children and the way that masters treated the servants was a real pastoral issue in the churches even today
[2384.72 --> 2412.72]  but yet here they are in Ephesus the no status people gathered together with the powerful in public they were listening to this letter from the apostle Paul right from this highly educated wealthy man whose own understanding of power and relational dynamics was totally turned on its head by Jesus
[2412.72 --> 2442.72]  and as they listened they are surprised by the fact that they are spoken to directly right Paul speaks to the no status people directly before he speaks to the people with status and power he speaks to the wives and the children and the slaves first and directly it's unheard of it was very
[2442.72 --> 2466.72]  revolutionary revolutionary and now I want to emphasize again that at the heart of this revolutionary passage is really just one foundational command one basic exhortation and we can't lose sight of this because this is the key to understanding this whole passage and the one command is in chapter 5 verse 18
[2466.72 --> 2495.72]  be filled with the spirit right none of what Paul works out here of this gospel revolution is going to work unless we are filled with the spirit be filled with the spirit of God everything Paul writes about our relationships with one another flows out of being filled with the very life of God himself
[2495.72 --> 2525.56]  and again that's the one command be filled with the spirit of God and again these are not commands they are results of this one command to be filled with the spirit so let's look at this again and we've you know looked at this passage a couple weeks before but it's still part of what we are looking at today so I want to make sure we understand
[2525.56 --> 2550.56]  Paul writes this here's the command be filled with the spirit five part of the spirit speaking to one another with psalms and hymns and songs from the spirit singing making melody making music from your heart to the Lord always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ
[2550.56 --> 2579.56]  so submitting to one another is a result of being filled with the spirit of having the spirit of God dwelling in us the command the imperative is be filled with the spirit well then results of living out the spirit filled life how it changes and transforms us is that we will now submit to one another so then Paul goes on and works out how in these three sets of human relationships in the context of the household
[2579.56 --> 2597.56]  wives and husbands wives and husbands children and parents slaves and masters submit to one another and as I've mentioned in previous weeks submitting that word literally means to stand under be filled with the spirit standing under one another
[2597.56 --> 2600.30]  wives standing under the spirit standing under kids within the spirit of living out of son of mother wives even next week
[2600.30 --> 2603.56]  S parece that we're going to be filled with these shimmering in such words is that we have a brilliance saying we need each other or looking at this idea that it is without having intelligently
[2603.56 --> 2605.92]  Children standing under your parents.
[2606.06 --> 2608.08]  Parents standing under your children.
[2609.12 --> 2611.10]  Slaves standing under your masters.
[2611.54 --> 2614.02]  Masters standing under your slaves.
[2615.84 --> 2620.78]  The idea is to deny yourself, to humble yourself,
[2621.02 --> 2624.32]  so that the other person can be raised up to flourish.
[2625.12 --> 2626.80]  Give yourselves to one another.
[2627.76 --> 2631.42]  And that means that for us, at any particular time,
[2631.42 --> 2633.52]  we ought to have an answer for this question,
[2634.30 --> 2637.68]  for whom am I giving up my life?
[2641.20 --> 2644.18]  In the church, everyone should be able to answer that question.
[2644.30 --> 2647.64]  For whom am I giving up my life?
[2649.06 --> 2652.68]  By this, Jesus said, all people will know that you are my disciples
[2652.68 --> 2655.00]  if you love one another.
[2656.16 --> 2658.46]  So now let's take a closer look at this passage,
[2658.46 --> 2661.56]  at these verses about slaves and masters in the church,
[2661.56 --> 2664.64]  and then kind of see how it relates to us today.
[2665.10 --> 2666.80]  So our text begins in verse 5,
[2667.50 --> 2668.76]  where Paul says,
[2669.22 --> 2672.40]  Slaves, obey your earthly masters.
[2672.40 --> 2678.32]  So we have to begin with the elephant in the room.
[2679.86 --> 2681.84]  Is Paul defending,
[2682.84 --> 2684.40]  even advocating,
[2684.96 --> 2686.24]  for slavery?
[2687.14 --> 2689.16]  The answer is no.
[2690.52 --> 2692.70]  God established marriage.
[2692.70 --> 2696.02]  God established the family.
[2696.02 --> 2699.24]  God did not institute slavery.
[2699.44 --> 2700.56]  That's something that we did.
[2702.26 --> 2703.88]  And those who throughout history,
[2704.00 --> 2706.32]  who have taken this text to justify slavery
[2706.32 --> 2708.22]  as something that God did intend,
[2708.72 --> 2709.86]  have not read it carefully.
[2709.86 --> 2712.26]  The fact is,
[2712.44 --> 2716.74]  what Paul says to slaves is actually even more revolutionary
[2716.74 --> 2720.56]  than if he had tried to overtly overthrow
[2720.56 --> 2722.84]  the institution of slavery in the first century.
[2723.08 --> 2725.60]  If he had tried to stir up a slave revolt,
[2725.86 --> 2727.66]  it would have failed.
[2728.36 --> 2730.82]  There is no possible way it could have happened.
[2731.24 --> 2733.12]  It's important to realize why.
[2733.12 --> 2738.06]  That slavery in the Roman world in the first century
[2738.06 --> 2741.30]  was very, very different from slavery of Africans
[2741.30 --> 2743.78]  in the New World that we might be more familiar with.
[2744.48 --> 2745.46]  So for one,
[2746.02 --> 2749.14]  slavery in the Roman world was not based on race or ethnicity.
[2749.76 --> 2753.76]  There were slaves from races from all over the world.
[2755.54 --> 2759.08]  And slavery was widespread in the ancient world.
[2759.78 --> 2761.34]  Slaves made up, scholars say,
[2761.34 --> 2765.90]  between something like 10 to 30% of the population
[2765.90 --> 2767.40]  in the first century Roman Empire.
[2767.54 --> 2768.36]  In the city of Rome,
[2768.78 --> 2771.16]  one in every three people were slaves.
[2772.66 --> 2775.62]  Slavery was woven into the very fabric of life.
[2776.32 --> 2778.88]  So what you'd have is you have free men and women
[2778.88 --> 2782.10]  and slaves working alongside each other
[2782.10 --> 2783.80]  in the context of the household,
[2784.04 --> 2786.72]  which was the basis of economic life.
[2787.62 --> 2789.96]  And so this was before the Industrial Revolution.
[2789.96 --> 2792.54]  And before the Industrial Revolution,
[2792.68 --> 2793.94]  the production of goods,
[2794.10 --> 2795.66]  the providing of services,
[2795.66 --> 2797.56]  was done from the home.
[2798.42 --> 2800.42]  There weren't factories and office buildings
[2800.42 --> 2801.08]  that you go to.
[2802.56 --> 2805.50]  So in addition to providing manual labor
[2805.50 --> 2807.16]  that we may think of as slave labor,
[2807.36 --> 2809.36]  slaves, though, were also doctors.
[2810.02 --> 2810.88]  They were teachers.
[2811.26 --> 2813.04]  They ran and managed the household.
[2813.22 --> 2815.00]  They were administrators and accountants,
[2815.28 --> 2816.96]  kind of what we think of as the middle class.
[2816.96 --> 2820.90]  And they were slaves who rose to the position
[2820.90 --> 2823.20]  of city administrators in the Roman Empire.
[2823.98 --> 2826.34]  The Apostle Paul, when he stands before Felix,
[2827.32 --> 2829.20]  in Acts 24, I think it is,
[2829.58 --> 2831.54]  Felix, we know from other sources,
[2832.18 --> 2833.30]  was formerly a slave.
[2833.84 --> 2837.10]  And he was now the governor of all of Judea.
[2837.10 --> 2841.22]  There are also Roman inscriptions
[2841.22 --> 2842.56]  that talk about the practice
[2842.56 --> 2843.72]  that at age 30,
[2844.00 --> 2845.36]  many slaves in the Roman Empire
[2845.36 --> 2846.22]  were simply set free.
[2848.10 --> 2849.86]  And once they were free,
[2850.02 --> 2851.52]  they would often advance in wealth
[2851.52 --> 2852.40]  and social status.
[2852.74 --> 2853.84]  Now, I'm saying all of this
[2853.84 --> 2855.04]  just so we can understand
[2855.04 --> 2857.84]  this thing that was very different
[2857.84 --> 2859.18]  from our experience.
[2860.30 --> 2861.90]  This is not at all to say
[2861.90 --> 2864.18]  that this was a rosy situation for slaves.
[2864.18 --> 2866.72]  There were different conditions.
[2867.68 --> 2870.14]  Some had it relatively well.
[2870.96 --> 2873.36]  They had good relationships with their masters,
[2873.56 --> 2874.46]  although, you know,
[2874.58 --> 2875.78]  probably they would have preferred
[2875.78 --> 2876.48]  to have their freedom.
[2877.40 --> 2879.56]  But unfortunately, many did not.
[2880.44 --> 2883.88]  Some masters were harsh and evil.
[2884.72 --> 2885.86]  And in the ancient world,
[2885.98 --> 2888.06]  slaves didn't have rights.
[2888.06 --> 2891.90]  The idea of human rights for all people
[2891.90 --> 2893.78]  comes from Christianity,
[2894.04 --> 2895.46]  not from the Roman Empire.
[2896.36 --> 2898.54]  So in the time that Paul wrote this letter,
[2899.16 --> 2900.44]  this is how it was.
[2901.30 --> 2903.36]  So when Paul's writing to the church,
[2904.16 --> 2908.02]  he's addressing Christians in the church
[2908.02 --> 2909.94]  who were slaves.
[2910.88 --> 2912.92]  And if that's not uncomfortable enough,
[2913.12 --> 2915.86]  he is addressing Christians in the church
[2915.86 --> 2917.20]  who were masters.
[2918.32 --> 2920.66]  And they would be in the church together.
[2921.82 --> 2922.90]  He had to do this.
[2922.96 --> 2923.80]  He had to address this
[2923.80 --> 2925.58]  because this was a real church.
[2925.92 --> 2927.70]  This was in the real world,
[2927.82 --> 2928.34]  in Ephesus,
[2928.60 --> 2929.42]  in the Roman Empire,
[2929.58 --> 2930.38]  in the first century.
[2931.78 --> 2932.88]  So in this passage,
[2933.02 --> 2934.98]  Paul is not affirming
[2934.98 --> 2936.22]  the social order of slavery.
[2937.14 --> 2938.00]  He's not saying,
[2938.18 --> 2938.96]  yes, this is great.
[2939.72 --> 2939.96]  No.
[2940.18 --> 2941.26]  He is also, though,
[2941.32 --> 2943.28]  not trying to abolish it,
[2943.76 --> 2944.94]  which would have been impossible.
[2945.86 --> 2947.24]  What Paul is doing here
[2947.24 --> 2949.24]  is he simply is applying
[2949.24 --> 2951.08]  his theology
[2951.08 --> 2953.26]  of union with Christ
[2953.26 --> 2954.46]  and a union that we have
[2954.46 --> 2955.06]  with one another
[2955.06 --> 2956.20]  as the body of Christ
[2956.20 --> 2958.96]  to the household relationships
[2958.96 --> 2960.48]  as he encountered them.
[2961.14 --> 2962.48]  To all of these relationships
[2962.48 --> 2963.78]  in which his people
[2963.78 --> 2965.64]  actually lived.
[2965.72 --> 2966.48]  He's being a pastor.
[2967.18 --> 2968.10]  He's applying the gospel
[2968.10 --> 2969.84]  to our real life situations.
[2971.24 --> 2972.02]  And so this passage
[2972.02 --> 2973.20]  is not about the status
[2973.20 --> 2974.06]  of the social order,
[2974.20 --> 2975.40]  but it's about the shape
[2975.40 --> 2976.62]  of love within
[2976.62 --> 2978.40]  the social order.
[2979.50 --> 2981.56]  Now, at the same time,
[2982.28 --> 2983.74]  Paul doesn't have to say,
[2983.86 --> 2985.82]  masters, free your slaves,
[2985.82 --> 2987.58]  because he says something
[2987.58 --> 2988.44]  just as radical
[2988.44 --> 2989.82]  and just as revolutionary
[2989.82 --> 2991.22]  in that time,
[2991.60 --> 2993.80]  which eventually brought about
[2993.80 --> 2994.92]  the demise of slavery
[2994.92 --> 2995.98]  in the Western world.
[2996.66 --> 2997.58]  What did he say?
[2997.58 --> 2999.58]  He said one word.
[3000.54 --> 3001.02]  He said,
[3001.80 --> 3002.18]  brother.
[3003.20 --> 3004.14]  He said, brother.
[3005.50 --> 3007.68]  Imagine masters and slaves
[3007.68 --> 3008.84]  sitting together
[3008.84 --> 3009.62]  in a small church
[3009.62 --> 3010.64]  listening to this letter
[3010.64 --> 3011.16]  being read.
[3011.66 --> 3012.60]  And Paul says to them,
[3012.74 --> 3013.12]  masters,
[3014.14 --> 3014.76]  slaves,
[3015.32 --> 3016.28]  you are brothers
[3016.28 --> 3018.44]  and sisters in Christ.
[3019.00 --> 3020.36]  And you have to submit
[3020.36 --> 3022.04]  to one another now
[3022.04 --> 3023.62]  out of reverence
[3023.62 --> 3024.82]  for Christ.
[3027.26 --> 3027.90]  So now,
[3028.16 --> 3030.16]  what does that
[3030.16 --> 3031.38]  mutual submission
[3031.38 --> 3033.18]  between masters
[3033.18 --> 3033.70]  and slaves
[3033.70 --> 3034.50]  look like?
[3035.80 --> 3037.20]  And that's what Paul
[3037.20 --> 3038.26]  gets into in this passage,
[3038.36 --> 3038.46]  right?
[3038.52 --> 3040.28]  He's being very practical.
[3041.34 --> 3042.36]  And the big idea
[3042.36 --> 3043.14]  I think we see,
[3043.80 --> 3044.46]  this principle
[3044.46 --> 3044.98]  of submission
[3044.98 --> 3045.60]  between masters
[3045.60 --> 3046.10]  and slaves,
[3046.44 --> 3047.52]  is that both
[3047.52 --> 3048.90]  are serving Christ
[3048.90 --> 3050.76]  with all of their heart.
[3051.28 --> 3051.40]  Okay,
[3051.40 --> 3052.06]  that's the principle.
[3052.42 --> 3053.30]  It's kind of two parts.
[3053.84 --> 3054.78]  Serving Christ,
[3056.36 --> 3057.82]  masters are serving Christ.
[3057.96 --> 3058.96]  Slaves are serving Christ.
[3059.52 --> 3060.54]  And they're doing it
[3060.54 --> 3061.96]  with all of their hearts
[3061.96 --> 3063.56]  as unto the Lord.
[3064.38 --> 3064.54]  Okay,
[3064.56 --> 3065.02]  so let's look at
[3065.02 --> 3065.76]  those two aspects.
[3065.88 --> 3066.02]  Okay,
[3066.04 --> 3066.70]  serving Christ.
[3067.04 --> 3067.96]  First thing we see
[3067.96 --> 3068.88]  is that Jesus
[3068.88 --> 3070.36]  is our true master
[3070.36 --> 3071.86]  and ultimately
[3071.86 --> 3072.68]  both masters
[3072.68 --> 3073.40]  and slaves,
[3073.52 --> 3074.62]  they are serving him.
[3075.48 --> 3076.26]  And this comes up
[3076.26 --> 3076.98]  in several places
[3076.98 --> 3077.58]  in our text.
[3077.68 --> 3078.76]  So let's look
[3078.76 --> 3079.74]  at the passage again.
[3080.26 --> 3080.82]  Let's read
[3080.82 --> 3082.00]  verses 5 to 8.
[3084.50 --> 3085.14]  And, you know,
[3085.20 --> 3086.12]  I've kind of highlighted,
[3086.54 --> 3087.16]  of course,
[3087.28 --> 3088.56]  the parts
[3088.56 --> 3089.48]  I want us to focus on.
[3089.54 --> 3089.84]  So it says,
[3089.92 --> 3090.18]  slaves,
[3090.26 --> 3091.32]  obey your earthly masters
[3091.32 --> 3092.88]  with respect and fear,
[3093.52 --> 3094.56]  with sincerity of heart,
[3094.70 --> 3095.88]  just as you would
[3095.88 --> 3096.66]  obey Christ.
[3097.40 --> 3097.88]  Obey them
[3097.88 --> 3098.58]  not only to win
[3098.58 --> 3099.24]  their favor
[3099.24 --> 3100.48]  when their eye is on you,
[3100.60 --> 3102.22]  but as slaves of Christ
[3102.22 --> 3103.42]  doing the will of God
[3103.42 --> 3104.76]  from your heart.
[3105.54 --> 3106.50]  Serve wholeheartedly
[3106.50 --> 3108.26]  as if you were serving
[3108.26 --> 3109.52]  the Lord,
[3110.14 --> 3111.72]  not people.
[3112.88 --> 3114.02]  Can you imagine
[3114.02 --> 3115.78]  masters and slaves
[3115.78 --> 3116.46]  hearing this
[3116.46 --> 3117.72]  and just the questions
[3117.72 --> 3118.74]  flying around
[3118.74 --> 3119.26]  in their heads?
[3119.92 --> 3120.60]  What do you mean
[3120.60 --> 3121.58]  as slaves of Christ
[3121.58 --> 3122.40]  doing the will of God?
[3122.46 --> 3123.02]  Aren't slaves
[3123.02 --> 3123.56]  doing the will
[3123.56 --> 3124.16]  of their masters?
[3126.10 --> 3127.78]  Serving the Lord,
[3127.90 --> 3128.54]  not people,
[3128.96 --> 3129.58]  says Paul.
[3129.58 --> 3130.20]  I mean,
[3130.92 --> 3132.72]  slaves are serving Jesus,
[3133.22 --> 3134.42]  not their masters?
[3134.82 --> 3135.66]  What is this?
[3136.96 --> 3138.34]  And then verse 9 says,
[3139.58 --> 3140.28]  and masters,
[3140.94 --> 3142.32]  treat your slaves
[3142.32 --> 3143.88]  in the same way.
[3144.66 --> 3145.82]  Do not threaten them,
[3146.20 --> 3146.94]  since you know
[3146.94 --> 3147.64]  that he,
[3147.82 --> 3149.06]  who is both their master
[3149.06 --> 3149.64]  and yours,
[3149.76 --> 3150.36]  is in heaven,
[3150.82 --> 3151.94]  and there is no favoritism
[3151.94 --> 3152.36]  with him.
[3153.42 --> 3154.04]  And so masters
[3154.04 --> 3154.62]  are reminded
[3154.62 --> 3155.62]  that everything they do
[3155.62 --> 3156.34]  in their mastering
[3156.34 --> 3157.86]  is done with Jesus,
[3157.98 --> 3158.58]  who himself
[3158.58 --> 3159.64]  is their master.
[3161.22 --> 3162.12]  What this means
[3162.12 --> 3163.16]  is that slaves
[3163.16 --> 3164.18]  and masters,
[3164.46 --> 3165.30]  you belong
[3165.30 --> 3166.20]  to the Lord.
[3166.98 --> 3168.06]  And he calls you
[3168.06 --> 3169.72]  to follow in his way,
[3170.40 --> 3171.12]  which is the way
[3171.12 --> 3171.74]  of service.
[3171.92 --> 3173.04]  Jesus is the Lord
[3173.04 --> 3174.50]  who serves.
[3175.90 --> 3176.86]  And this is similar
[3176.86 --> 3177.96]  to what Paul says elsewhere.
[3178.40 --> 3179.04]  I want to bring us
[3179.04 --> 3179.94]  to two other passages.
[3180.48 --> 3182.06]  1 Corinthians 7, 22.
[3182.60 --> 3183.60]  Paul says this,
[3184.14 --> 3184.86]  for the one
[3184.86 --> 3186.02]  who was a slave
[3186.02 --> 3186.72]  when called
[3186.72 --> 3187.32]  to the faith
[3187.32 --> 3187.92]  in the Lord,
[3188.58 --> 3189.84]  is the Lord's
[3189.84 --> 3190.56]  free person.
[3191.82 --> 3192.22]  Similarly,
[3194.06 --> 3195.38]  the one
[3195.38 --> 3196.38]  who was free
[3196.38 --> 3197.48]  when called
[3197.48 --> 3199.84]  is Christ's slave.
[3201.38 --> 3202.44]  So whether you
[3202.44 --> 3203.08]  are free
[3203.08 --> 3204.32]  or a slave,
[3204.60 --> 3205.36]  you belong
[3205.36 --> 3206.04]  to Christ.
[3207.04 --> 3208.02]  In Paul's theology,
[3208.22 --> 3209.00]  every station
[3209.00 --> 3209.48]  of life,
[3209.58 --> 3210.72]  every social class,
[3211.04 --> 3211.76]  every position
[3211.76 --> 3212.92]  has now
[3212.92 --> 3214.16]  been put
[3214.16 --> 3215.48]  in second place,
[3215.68 --> 3217.00]  if at best.
[3217.00 --> 3217.10]  Christ,
[3217.56 --> 3218.80]  everything in life
[3218.80 --> 3219.52]  has now been
[3219.52 --> 3220.68]  reordered,
[3221.04 --> 3222.04]  relativized
[3222.04 --> 3222.92]  by the more
[3222.92 --> 3224.08]  important truth
[3224.08 --> 3224.90]  that we are
[3224.90 --> 3225.54]  in Christ.
[3226.30 --> 3227.16]  It almost seems
[3227.16 --> 3227.68]  like Paul doesn't
[3227.68 --> 3228.36]  really care
[3228.36 --> 3229.12]  that much.
[3229.20 --> 3229.52]  Whatever.
[3230.04 --> 3230.76]  If you're a slave,
[3231.34 --> 3232.02]  you belong to Christ.
[3232.10 --> 3232.60]  If you're free,
[3232.78 --> 3233.58]  you belong to Christ.
[3234.72 --> 3235.42]  Now just live
[3235.42 --> 3236.52]  out your life
[3236.52 --> 3237.68]  of following Christ
[3237.68 --> 3238.60]  in whatever station
[3238.60 --> 3239.22]  of life God
[3239.22 --> 3239.80]  has given you.
[3240.74 --> 3241.82]  That's the main thing.
[3243.26 --> 3244.44]  Or in Colossians,
[3244.52 --> 3245.56]  he even says this,
[3245.56 --> 3247.22]  there is no
[3247.22 --> 3248.32]  Gentile or Jew,
[3248.92 --> 3249.58]  circumcised,
[3249.70 --> 3250.46]  uncircumcised,
[3250.58 --> 3251.06]  barbarian,
[3251.16 --> 3251.54]  Scythian,
[3251.88 --> 3252.80]  slave or free,
[3253.14 --> 3254.12]  but Christ is all
[3254.12 --> 3255.54]  and he is in all.
[3257.90 --> 3258.54]  And since it's
[3258.54 --> 3259.36]  Reformation Sunday,
[3259.66 --> 3260.28]  we need a quote
[3260.28 --> 3260.86]  from Martin Luther.
[3261.62 --> 3262.12]  So here's what
[3262.12 --> 3262.92]  Martin Luther says
[3262.92 --> 3264.34]  about Christian freedom.
[3266.12 --> 3267.16]  A Christian
[3267.16 --> 3269.84]  is the most free
[3269.84 --> 3271.10]  Lord of all
[3271.10 --> 3272.18]  and subject
[3272.18 --> 3272.94]  to none.
[3273.80 --> 3273.92]  Okay,
[3273.92 --> 3274.62]  a Christian really
[3274.62 --> 3276.20]  isn't spiritually
[3276.20 --> 3278.42]  a slave to anybody.
[3278.86 --> 3279.94]  We are slaves
[3279.94 --> 3281.12]  only to Christ.
[3282.04 --> 3282.44]  And then he says
[3282.44 --> 3282.94]  a Christian
[3282.94 --> 3283.76]  is the most
[3283.76 --> 3284.94]  dutiful servant
[3284.94 --> 3286.14]  of all
[3286.14 --> 3287.66]  and subject
[3287.66 --> 3289.04]  to everyone.
[3291.06 --> 3291.22]  Okay,
[3291.22 --> 3292.08]  when you belong
[3292.08 --> 3293.00]  to Christ,
[3293.60 --> 3294.72]  the Lord
[3294.72 --> 3296.22]  who humbled himself
[3296.22 --> 3297.08]  and became
[3297.08 --> 3297.90]  nothing,
[3298.08 --> 3298.70]  emptied himself,
[3298.84 --> 3299.50]  taking the form
[3299.50 --> 3300.10]  of a what?
[3300.10 --> 3302.12]  Servant
[3302.12 --> 3303.52]  is the same word,
[3303.96 --> 3304.32]  slave.
[3305.46 --> 3305.96]  Christ
[3305.96 --> 3307.42]  became a slave,
[3307.54 --> 3308.00]  a doulos
[3308.00 --> 3309.32]  for us.
[3310.06 --> 3310.90]  So we belong
[3310.90 --> 3311.46]  to Christ
[3311.46 --> 3313.04]  and we follow
[3313.04 --> 3313.72]  the way of Christ
[3313.72 --> 3315.28]  by being subject
[3315.28 --> 3315.98]  to all people,
[3316.32 --> 3317.00]  not spiritually.
[3317.18 --> 3317.60]  Spiritually,
[3317.74 --> 3318.90]  we are free.
[3320.04 --> 3320.48]  Right?
[3320.70 --> 3321.80]  If Christ has set you free,
[3321.86 --> 3322.78]  you are free indeed.
[3323.12 --> 3324.24]  No matter what position
[3324.24 --> 3325.02]  in life you have,
[3325.06 --> 3325.68]  all of us
[3325.68 --> 3326.78]  follow Christ
[3326.78 --> 3327.16]  and service
[3327.16 --> 3327.74]  to others.
[3330.12 --> 3330.56]  Again,
[3330.70 --> 3331.48]  everything has been
[3331.48 --> 3332.08]  reordered
[3332.08 --> 3333.12]  and the one thing
[3333.12 --> 3333.64]  that matters
[3333.64 --> 3334.26]  is that we are
[3334.26 --> 3334.82]  in Jesus
[3334.82 --> 3336.24]  and there is
[3336.24 --> 3338.08]  great equality there.
[3338.74 --> 3339.32]  So this is
[3339.32 --> 3340.38]  absolutely revolutionary
[3340.38 --> 3342.34]  because what it's doing
[3342.34 --> 3343.42]  is Paul is putting
[3343.42 --> 3344.52]  slaves and masters
[3344.52 --> 3346.00]  on equal footing.
[3346.98 --> 3348.24]  That's what Paul says here
[3348.24 --> 3349.04]  then in verse 9,
[3349.28 --> 3350.58]  there is no favoritism
[3350.58 --> 3351.18]  with him,
[3352.00 --> 3352.72]  with Christ.
[3352.78 --> 3353.74]  There is no favoritism
[3353.74 --> 3354.24]  with Christ.
[3355.42 --> 3356.44]  There is equality.
[3357.70 --> 3359.42]  So in dignifying slaves,
[3359.74 --> 3360.66]  equalizing them
[3360.66 --> 3361.18]  with masters,
[3361.32 --> 3361.94]  Paul is creating
[3361.94 --> 3362.90]  a new humanity.
[3363.28 --> 3363.62]  He is creating
[3363.62 --> 3364.40]  a new society.
[3365.06 --> 3365.56]  He is creating
[3365.56 --> 3366.26]  the grounds
[3366.26 --> 3367.26]  of a transformation
[3367.26 --> 3368.54]  that would be
[3368.54 --> 3369.42]  sustainable.
[3371.20 --> 3371.80]  So now,
[3371.90 --> 3372.46]  how do we think
[3372.46 --> 3372.94]  about how this
[3372.94 --> 3373.70]  applies to us?
[3375.70 --> 3376.14]  Now,
[3376.50 --> 3377.98]  we are not slaves
[3377.98 --> 3379.46]  but
[3379.46 --> 3380.76]  most of us
[3380.76 --> 3381.46]  have similar
[3381.46 --> 3382.18]  relationships
[3382.18 --> 3382.92]  in our work.
[3383.92 --> 3384.12]  You know,
[3384.20 --> 3384.96]  we have people
[3384.96 --> 3386.04]  who,
[3386.92 --> 3387.22]  you know,
[3387.28 --> 3387.88]  we have bosses
[3387.88 --> 3388.96]  over us
[3388.96 --> 3389.42]  that we are
[3389.42 --> 3390.10]  accountable to,
[3390.20 --> 3390.42]  maybe.
[3391.08 --> 3391.98]  Or we might be
[3391.98 --> 3392.52]  in a position
[3392.52 --> 3393.14]  of leadership
[3393.14 --> 3393.88]  of some sort
[3393.88 --> 3394.58]  where we are
[3394.58 --> 3395.76]  over people
[3395.76 --> 3396.44]  and they are
[3396.44 --> 3397.38]  accountable to us
[3397.38 --> 3397.94]  in a sense.
[3398.46 --> 3399.50]  And what Paul says here
[3399.50 --> 3400.18]  is that the work
[3400.18 --> 3401.00]  that you are doing,
[3401.58 --> 3402.52]  whether you are
[3402.52 --> 3403.04]  employed
[3403.04 --> 3404.96]  or whether you are
[3404.96 --> 3406.16]  a student in school,
[3406.88 --> 3407.52]  whether you are
[3407.52 --> 3408.72]  volunteering your time,
[3409.34 --> 3409.98]  whether you are
[3409.98 --> 3411.20]  at home raising kids,
[3411.20 --> 3412.78]  whatever your work
[3412.78 --> 3413.38]  is,
[3413.86 --> 3414.84]  it is a call
[3414.84 --> 3416.62]  to serve Jesus.
[3417.82 --> 3418.60]  That means
[3418.60 --> 3419.42]  whatever work
[3419.42 --> 3419.84]  you do,
[3420.16 --> 3420.92]  you are serving
[3420.92 --> 3421.62]  the Lord.
[3422.40 --> 3423.12]  If you cook
[3423.12 --> 3423.62]  a meal,
[3424.30 --> 3425.32]  you cook it
[3425.32 --> 3426.26]  as if Jesus
[3426.26 --> 3427.50]  were going
[3427.50 --> 3427.94]  to eat it.
[3429.16 --> 3429.90]  When you
[3429.90 --> 3430.84]  clean the house,
[3431.30 --> 3432.10]  you clean it
[3432.10 --> 3432.82]  as if Jesus
[3432.82 --> 3433.68]  was the honored
[3433.68 --> 3434.56]  guest who's
[3434.56 --> 3434.90]  going to come
[3434.90 --> 3435.48]  over to visit.
[3437.08 --> 3438.18]  In your business,
[3438.24 --> 3438.84]  as you serve
[3438.84 --> 3439.50]  your customers,
[3439.50 --> 3440.94]  you do it
[3440.94 --> 3441.62]  as if Jesus
[3441.62 --> 3442.50]  was the one
[3442.50 --> 3443.48]  that you are serving.
[3444.96 --> 3445.64]  As you write
[3445.64 --> 3446.10]  emails,
[3446.52 --> 3447.02]  you write them
[3447.02 --> 3447.68]  as if Jesus
[3447.68 --> 3448.44]  was the one
[3448.44 --> 3448.82]  who is going
[3448.82 --> 3449.52]  to receive it.
[3450.68 --> 3451.62]  If you're a student,
[3451.74 --> 3452.24]  you study
[3452.24 --> 3452.90]  as if Jesus
[3452.90 --> 3454.10]  was your teacher.
[3456.24 --> 3456.86]  So I heard
[3456.86 --> 3457.38]  this story
[3457.38 --> 3458.76]  about a
[3458.76 --> 3459.94]  flight attendant
[3459.94 --> 3460.98]  who had
[3460.98 --> 3462.02]  a horrible,
[3462.18 --> 3462.94]  very awful,
[3463.36 --> 3463.66]  you know,
[3463.74 --> 3464.14]  no good,
[3464.22 --> 3464.72]  very bad day.
[3465.70 --> 3466.58]  It was a bad flight.
[3467.24 --> 3467.86]  There was
[3467.86 --> 3468.68]  a man
[3468.68 --> 3469.34]  on the flight
[3469.34 --> 3470.24]  who was very
[3470.24 --> 3470.76]  rude.
[3471.68 --> 3472.18]  He spilled
[3472.18 --> 3472.66]  his coffee
[3472.66 --> 3473.34]  and blamed her.
[3474.04 --> 3474.36]  And then he
[3474.36 --> 3475.00]  demanded that
[3475.00 --> 3475.86]  she clean it up
[3475.86 --> 3476.66]  and then to go
[3476.66 --> 3477.30]  get him a new one.
[3478.26 --> 3478.64]  And then there
[3478.64 --> 3479.16]  was a child
[3479.16 --> 3479.80]  on the flight
[3479.80 --> 3481.18]  who exploded
[3481.18 --> 3481.80]  his diaper
[3481.80 --> 3483.16]  and it stung
[3483.16 --> 3483.56]  up the whole
[3483.56 --> 3483.82]  plane.
[3485.00 --> 3485.28]  And this
[3485.28 --> 3486.44]  flight attendant
[3486.44 --> 3487.12]  got in there,
[3487.24 --> 3487.80]  helped the mom
[3487.80 --> 3488.70]  clean everything up,
[3488.74 --> 3489.46]  was very sympathetic
[3489.46 --> 3490.06]  to her,
[3490.28 --> 3490.94]  never complained.
[3491.36 --> 3491.70]  And there were
[3491.70 --> 3492.28]  just several
[3492.28 --> 3493.44]  instances like this
[3493.44 --> 3494.34]  on a short
[3494.34 --> 3495.02]  two-hour flight.
[3495.96 --> 3496.18]  Well,
[3496.24 --> 3496.58]  at the end
[3496.58 --> 3497.06]  of the flight,
[3497.16 --> 3497.32]  you know,
[3497.34 --> 3499.14]  as they do,
[3499.42 --> 3500.30]  the flight attendants
[3500.30 --> 3501.00]  will greet you
[3501.00 --> 3501.48]  and wish you
[3501.48 --> 3501.88]  a good day.
[3503.08 --> 3504.30]  And as this woman
[3504.30 --> 3505.32]  was greeting everybody
[3505.32 --> 3505.92]  as they were getting
[3505.92 --> 3506.68]  off the plane,
[3507.36 --> 3508.00]  a passenger
[3508.00 --> 3508.90]  came up to her
[3508.90 --> 3509.34]  who had seen
[3509.34 --> 3509.96]  everything that
[3509.96 --> 3510.52]  had happened
[3510.52 --> 3512.16]  and said,
[3512.32 --> 3513.14]  I would like you
[3513.14 --> 3513.58]  to give me
[3513.58 --> 3514.50]  the name of your boss.
[3514.58 --> 3514.70]  You know,
[3514.74 --> 3515.46]  I want to write them
[3515.46 --> 3515.82]  a letter
[3515.82 --> 3516.60]  and tell them
[3516.60 --> 3518.78]  what you just did,
[3519.26 --> 3520.64]  how well
[3520.64 --> 3522.08]  you did your work.
[3523.02 --> 3523.58]  And so she took
[3523.58 --> 3524.36]  the piece of paper
[3524.36 --> 3525.26]  and it's penned
[3525.26 --> 3526.56]  and she wrote down
[3526.56 --> 3527.52]  the name of her boss,
[3528.48 --> 3529.22]  Jesus Christ,
[3530.36 --> 3531.20]  and handed it back
[3531.20 --> 3531.50]  to him.
[3533.00 --> 3533.82]  She was working
[3533.82 --> 3534.32]  for Jesus
[3534.32 --> 3536.02]  and that explained
[3536.02 --> 3537.50]  everything that she did.
[3537.86 --> 3539.00]  She wasn't serving
[3539.00 --> 3539.54]  ultimately
[3539.54 --> 3541.42]  this harsh man.
[3541.62 --> 3542.70]  She wasn't serving
[3542.70 --> 3543.28]  ultimately
[3543.28 --> 3544.66]  this mother.
[3545.50 --> 3546.28]  She was serving
[3546.28 --> 3546.78]  Christ.
[3548.28 --> 3549.14]  So that's what
[3549.14 --> 3550.12]  Paul calls us to do,
[3550.38 --> 3551.60]  to serve Christ.
[3552.94 --> 3554.24]  And then secondly,
[3554.64 --> 3555.60]  the other aspect
[3555.60 --> 3556.34]  that we see
[3556.34 --> 3557.00]  in this passage
[3557.00 --> 3559.78]  is that we serve
[3559.78 --> 3560.46]  Christ
[3560.46 --> 3561.50]  with all
[3561.50 --> 3562.52]  of our heart.
[3563.36 --> 3563.88]  So again,
[3563.94 --> 3564.96]  let's look at this passage
[3564.96 --> 3566.20]  and let's see
[3566.20 --> 3567.64]  how Paul talks
[3567.64 --> 3568.16]  about this.
[3569.48 --> 3570.50]  So it says,
[3570.64 --> 3571.10]  slaves,
[3571.42 --> 3572.48]  obey your earthly masters
[3572.48 --> 3573.44]  with respect
[3573.44 --> 3573.94]  and fear,
[3574.78 --> 3575.72]  with sincerity
[3575.72 --> 3576.76]  of heart.
[3577.50 --> 3578.40]  Just as you would
[3578.40 --> 3579.30]  obey Christ,
[3580.20 --> 3581.14]  obey them not only
[3581.14 --> 3581.92]  to win their favor,
[3581.92 --> 3583.02]  when their eye is on you,
[3583.12 --> 3584.12]  but as slaves of Christ
[3584.12 --> 3585.26]  doing the will of God
[3585.26 --> 3586.62]  from your heart.
[3587.36 --> 3589.20]  Serve wholeheartedly
[3589.20 --> 3590.50]  as if you were serving
[3590.50 --> 3591.56]  the Lord and not people.
[3592.56 --> 3592.66]  Right?
[3592.78 --> 3593.46]  Do it from the heart,
[3593.58 --> 3593.86]  Paul says,
[3593.90 --> 3594.50]  three times.
[3595.56 --> 3596.40]  And that means,
[3596.58 --> 3597.00]  what does it mean
[3597.00 --> 3598.18]  to do it from the heart?
[3598.36 --> 3599.18]  Serve wholeheartedly.
[3599.40 --> 3599.58]  Well,
[3600.30 --> 3601.42]  we can think of a couple things.
[3601.52 --> 3602.64]  It means don't cut corners.
[3604.10 --> 3604.22]  Right?
[3604.30 --> 3606.12]  Don't do just the bare minimum,
[3606.32 --> 3607.10]  only when your boss
[3607.10 --> 3607.52]  is watching.
[3607.70 --> 3607.80]  You know,
[3607.84 --> 3609.00]  before I went to ministry,
[3609.00 --> 3609.96]  I worked at a desk
[3609.96 --> 3611.64]  for two years.
[3612.54 --> 3612.88]  And,
[3612.98 --> 3613.56]  you know,
[3613.62 --> 3614.36]  you do some work,
[3614.42 --> 3615.06]  you don't have enough,
[3615.14 --> 3615.62]  so you do it,
[3615.74 --> 3616.74]  then what?
[3616.98 --> 3617.60]  Nothing to do.
[3618.02 --> 3619.54]  So you pull up your browser,
[3620.00 --> 3620.72]  read some articles,
[3621.18 --> 3622.00]  if your boss is coming,
[3622.54 --> 3623.18]  you know.
[3624.42 --> 3624.88]  Paul says,
[3624.96 --> 3625.10]  no,
[3625.20 --> 3625.96]  don't do that.
[3626.52 --> 3626.64]  Right?
[3626.68 --> 3627.74]  Don't just do the bare minimum.
[3628.62 --> 3630.02]  Work wholeheartedly.
[3630.88 --> 3632.06]  Do the best work you can.
[3632.32 --> 3632.76]  Work in a way
[3632.76 --> 3634.06]  that honors Jesus Christ.
[3634.98 --> 3636.04]  Work and serve as if
[3636.04 --> 3636.54]  you were,
[3636.74 --> 3637.30]  what you were doing
[3637.30 --> 3638.48]  is a gift to God
[3638.48 --> 3639.94]  because it is.
[3641.30 --> 3642.46]  And then look at verse 8.
[3643.50 --> 3644.68]  Because you know
[3644.68 --> 3645.56]  that the Lord
[3645.56 --> 3647.32]  will reward each one of you
[3647.32 --> 3648.82]  for whatever good they do,
[3648.90 --> 3649.86]  whether you are a slave
[3649.86 --> 3650.44]  or free.
[3651.16 --> 3651.28]  Right?
[3651.34 --> 3651.62]  Paul says,
[3651.70 --> 3652.26]  whatever you do,
[3652.32 --> 3653.20]  whether you are a master
[3653.20 --> 3653.76]  or a slave,
[3654.12 --> 3654.76]  you need to know
[3654.76 --> 3655.70]  that God is watching.
[3656.96 --> 3657.96]  Even if your master
[3657.96 --> 3658.68]  doesn't see,
[3659.20 --> 3660.60]  God sees.
[3660.98 --> 3662.00]  And whatever good
[3662.00 --> 3662.92]  anyone does,
[3662.92 --> 3664.80]  it will be rendered
[3664.80 --> 3665.70]  back to you.
[3665.76 --> 3666.76]  It will be rewarded.
[3667.84 --> 3669.02]  It doesn't go unnoticed,
[3669.08 --> 3670.06]  this good that you do.
[3670.44 --> 3671.20]  Jesus knows
[3671.20 --> 3673.74]  because Jesus receives it.
[3675.40 --> 3676.28]  So that's the,
[3676.40 --> 3677.56]  that's this dynamic
[3677.56 --> 3678.28]  of submission
[3678.28 --> 3679.28]  for masters and slaves.
[3679.36 --> 3680.14]  That's what it looks like.
[3680.20 --> 3681.22]  It's serving Christ
[3681.22 --> 3682.96]  with all of your heart.
[3683.98 --> 3685.00]  Masters standing
[3685.00 --> 3685.90]  under slaves.
[3686.34 --> 3687.46]  Slaves standing
[3687.46 --> 3688.16]  under masters.
[3689.04 --> 3689.78]  The gospel
[3689.78 --> 3691.02]  brings down
[3691.02 --> 3692.14]  the walls of division.
[3692.14 --> 3693.26]  It creates
[3693.26 --> 3694.26]  a new humanity
[3694.26 --> 3695.64]  in which a slave,
[3695.80 --> 3696.62]  though greatly
[3696.62 --> 3697.38]  disempowered
[3697.38 --> 3698.00]  in society,
[3698.36 --> 3699.10]  becomes
[3699.10 --> 3700.56]  a brother
[3700.56 --> 3702.18]  or a sister
[3702.18 --> 3703.40]  in Christ.
[3704.52 --> 3706.24]  What a radical
[3706.24 --> 3707.36]  revolution.
[3707.88 --> 3708.92]  What a reformation
[3708.92 --> 3709.52]  it is.
[3710.34 --> 3710.54]  And,
[3710.62 --> 3711.00]  and friends,
[3711.12 --> 3711.40]  lastly,
[3711.58 --> 3712.78]  this was not just theoretical.
[3712.98 --> 3714.04]  This actually happened.
[3714.60 --> 3715.58]  This actually happened.
[3715.62 --> 3716.24]  I want to give you
[3716.24 --> 3716.66]  an example
[3716.66 --> 3717.86]  that we find
[3717.86 --> 3718.62]  right in our Bibles.
[3719.98 --> 3720.48]  Do you know that
[3720.48 --> 3721.34]  there's this letter
[3721.34 --> 3722.20]  called Philemon
[3722.20 --> 3723.86]  in the Bible?
[3724.08 --> 3724.58]  When's the last time
[3724.58 --> 3725.28]  we read Philemon?
[3726.12 --> 3727.24]  It's between the books
[3727.24 --> 3728.30]  of Titus and Hebrews.
[3729.24 --> 3730.14]  It's a short letter
[3730.14 --> 3730.76]  that Paul wrote.
[3731.04 --> 3731.34]  Actually,
[3731.44 --> 3732.12]  when you go home today,
[3732.24 --> 3732.86]  read Philemon.
[3732.94 --> 3733.92]  It's only like 25 verses.
[3735.40 --> 3736.48]  But Paul writes
[3736.48 --> 3737.88]  to a wealthy man
[3737.88 --> 3739.00]  by the name of Philemon.
[3739.86 --> 3740.46]  And Philemon
[3740.46 --> 3741.64]  was a master.
[3742.32 --> 3744.12]  And he had a runaway slave
[3744.12 --> 3745.92]  named Onesimus.
[3747.18 --> 3748.26]  Onesimus had run away,
[3748.26 --> 3749.54]  probably because
[3749.54 --> 3750.44]  he deserved
[3750.44 --> 3751.44]  some sort of punishment.
[3752.12 --> 3753.18]  Maybe he stole something
[3753.18 --> 3753.84]  from Philemon.
[3753.94 --> 3755.26]  We don't know the situation.
[3755.90 --> 3756.80]  But whatever it was,
[3756.82 --> 3757.40]  it was bad enough
[3757.40 --> 3758.28]  where Onesimus
[3758.28 --> 3759.34]  had run away.
[3759.88 --> 3760.64]  He felt like
[3760.64 --> 3761.32]  he had to get away.
[3762.28 --> 3763.30]  So in his journeys,
[3763.46 --> 3764.62]  far away from Philemon,
[3765.00 --> 3765.56]  running away,
[3766.26 --> 3767.40]  Onesimus meets who?
[3768.26 --> 3768.96]  He meets Paul.
[3769.82 --> 3770.80]  And he becomes a Christian.
[3770.96 --> 3771.20]  Of course,
[3771.28 --> 3771.78]  Paul tends to share
[3771.78 --> 3772.46]  the gospel with him.
[3773.16 --> 3774.12]  He becomes a Christian.
[3774.22 --> 3774.34]  Now,
[3774.44 --> 3775.18]  Paul calls him
[3775.18 --> 3776.46]  a son in the faith.
[3776.46 --> 3779.28]  And Onesimus loves Paul
[3779.28 --> 3780.32]  so dearly
[3780.32 --> 3780.90]  that even though
[3780.90 --> 3781.84]  Paul is in prison,
[3782.04 --> 3782.76]  Onesimus goes
[3782.76 --> 3784.22]  and he ministers to him
[3784.22 --> 3785.20]  and cares for him.
[3786.26 --> 3786.76]  And of course,
[3786.86 --> 3789.10]  Paul learns Onesimus' story.
[3790.12 --> 3790.26]  You know,
[3790.30 --> 3791.14]  maybe Paul said,
[3791.64 --> 3792.28]  so Onesimus,
[3792.34 --> 3792.46]  you know,
[3792.48 --> 3793.06]  what happened?
[3794.14 --> 3794.76]  And, you know,
[3794.78 --> 3795.24]  he would say,
[3795.34 --> 3795.54]  well,
[3795.64 --> 3796.56]  I worked for this guy
[3796.56 --> 3797.36]  named Philemon.
[3798.38 --> 3798.82]  Philemon!
[3799.14 --> 3799.36]  Wait,
[3799.42 --> 3800.40]  you mean the Philemon
[3800.40 --> 3801.06]  from that town?
[3801.60 --> 3801.96]  Yeah.
[3802.64 --> 3803.70]  I know him.
[3804.30 --> 3805.48]  I led him to Christ.
[3805.48 --> 3806.82]  He's a brother.
[3808.32 --> 3809.26]  So Paul would say,
[3809.36 --> 3809.50]  you know,
[3809.56 --> 3809.78]  look,
[3809.86 --> 3810.96]  I know you want to stay here
[3810.96 --> 3812.54]  and help me in my imprisonment,
[3813.12 --> 3814.14]  but you should go back.
[3814.20 --> 3815.52]  You should be reconciled
[3815.52 --> 3816.24]  to Philemon.
[3817.02 --> 3817.70]  And I want you
[3817.70 --> 3818.48]  to take this letter
[3818.48 --> 3819.16]  to Philemon.
[3819.26 --> 3820.38]  I want you to hand it to him.
[3821.84 --> 3823.24]  So Paul writes to Philemon
[3823.24 --> 3824.48]  and he says,
[3825.00 --> 3826.70]  I'm sending Onesimus
[3826.70 --> 3827.54]  back to you.
[3828.34 --> 3829.96]  And I'm going to remind you
[3829.96 --> 3832.76]  that you need to receive him
[3832.76 --> 3834.36]  as your brother.
[3834.36 --> 3837.44]  So listen to these couple verses.
[3837.64 --> 3837.78]  I mean,
[3837.84 --> 3838.00]  again,
[3838.06 --> 3838.64]  just read the letter.
[3838.74 --> 3839.14]  It's amazing.
[3839.58 --> 3840.56]  But here's a couple verses.
[3841.54 --> 3842.02]  He says,
[3843.32 --> 3844.50]  Paul writes to Philemon,
[3844.98 --> 3846.18]  perhaps the reason
[3846.18 --> 3848.52]  Onesimus was separated from you
[3848.52 --> 3849.36]  for a little while
[3849.36 --> 3852.36]  was that you might have him back forever.
[3853.92 --> 3855.56]  No longer as a slave,
[3855.62 --> 3856.72]  better than a slave,
[3857.10 --> 3859.18]  as a dear brother in the Lord.
[3859.18 --> 3861.40]  So if you consider me a partner,
[3861.56 --> 3862.24]  welcome him
[3862.24 --> 3863.88]  as you would
[3863.88 --> 3865.08]  me.
[3866.26 --> 3867.60]  That is powerful.
[3869.88 --> 3870.90]  So Onesimus
[3870.90 --> 3872.02]  goes back.
[3872.76 --> 3873.80]  He comes up the pathway.
[3874.96 --> 3875.78]  There's Philemon,
[3875.88 --> 3876.72]  his former master.
[3877.34 --> 3877.50]  You know,
[3877.56 --> 3879.22]  maybe he gave a respectful bow.
[3879.96 --> 3880.86]  And he said,
[3881.06 --> 3882.72]  this letter is from your brother Paul.
[3882.72 --> 3885.60]  And Philemon opens the letter
[3885.60 --> 3886.38]  and he reads it.
[3887.24 --> 3887.40]  You know,
[3887.48 --> 3888.28]  and I don't know,
[3888.36 --> 3888.88]  we're speculating,
[3889.08 --> 3890.16]  but I'd like to imagine
[3890.16 --> 3892.62]  that Philemon drops the parchment
[3892.62 --> 3893.20]  on the ground
[3893.20 --> 3895.08]  and he puts his arms
[3895.08 --> 3896.60]  around his former slave
[3896.60 --> 3898.32]  and he says,
[3898.50 --> 3899.06]  welcome back,
[3899.18 --> 3899.38]  brother.
[3901.68 --> 3904.44]  This is the redemptive revolution
[3904.44 --> 3906.22]  that the world needs.
[3906.22 --> 3907.86]  And it's all because
[3907.86 --> 3909.62]  Jesus Christ has come.
[3909.86 --> 3911.34]  The Spirit of God has come.
[3913.82 --> 3914.54]  So friends,
[3914.68 --> 3916.04]  let's be filled with the Spirit.
[3917.04 --> 3918.36]  And let's find ourselves
[3918.36 --> 3919.98]  living in a different kingdom
[3919.98 --> 3921.56]  and serving
[3921.56 --> 3923.54]  a very different kind of king.
[3924.26 --> 3925.18]  Let's pray together.
[3928.56 --> 3929.78]  Father, we thank you
[3929.78 --> 3931.94]  even for this passage,
[3932.18 --> 3932.30]  Lord,
[3932.38 --> 3934.86]  which has been so misused,
[3934.98 --> 3935.36]  but Lord,
[3935.36 --> 3936.78]  which is so actually
[3936.78 --> 3938.94]  subversively revolutionary,
[3940.12 --> 3940.64]  calling
[3940.64 --> 3942.56]  masters and slaves
[3942.56 --> 3944.68]  as one in Christ,
[3945.74 --> 3946.76]  calling them to serve
[3946.76 --> 3947.44]  one another
[3947.44 --> 3948.96]  out of reverence for Christ.
[3950.46 --> 3950.84]  And Lord,
[3950.94 --> 3952.64]  we live in the same world.
[3952.80 --> 3953.10]  We're not,
[3953.82 --> 3955.30]  thanks be to Christ,
[3955.48 --> 3956.56]  we are not slaves,
[3956.70 --> 3956.94]  but Lord,
[3957.00 --> 3957.90]  there are many slaves
[3957.90 --> 3958.80]  still in this world.
[3959.84 --> 3960.00]  Lord,
[3960.04 --> 3960.90]  would this revolution
[3960.90 --> 3961.98]  reach them as well?
[3962.06 --> 3962.70]  Would your people
[3962.70 --> 3963.84]  go out to
[3963.84 --> 3964.90]  free
[3964.90 --> 3966.48]  those who are captive
[3966.48 --> 3967.84]  in many different ways?
[3969.04 --> 3969.40]  And Lord,
[3969.46 --> 3970.90]  even in the everyday life
[3970.90 --> 3971.70]  of our relationships,
[3972.00 --> 3973.18]  of work,
[3973.30 --> 3974.28]  and of serving
[3974.28 --> 3975.20]  in different ways,
[3975.32 --> 3975.44]  Lord,
[3975.48 --> 3976.20]  would you help us
[3976.20 --> 3976.90]  to do so
[3976.90 --> 3978.50]  as unto the Lord,
[3979.58 --> 3979.98]  knowing
[3979.98 --> 3981.26]  that all good
[3981.26 --> 3981.98]  that we render
[3981.98 --> 3982.74]  is received
[3982.74 --> 3983.58]  by our Lord Jesus.
[3984.54 --> 3985.12]  Help us,
[3985.24 --> 3985.28]  Lord,
[3985.32 --> 3986.22]  to do it wholeheartedly.
[3986.82 --> 3987.26]  We pray
[3987.26 --> 3988.86]  for the Spirit's help,
[3988.86 --> 3989.94]  and we pray
[3989.94 --> 3990.66]  in Jesus' name.
[3991.28 --> 3991.52]  Amen.
[3991.52 --> 3991.60]  Amen.
[3991.60 --> 3991.70]  Amen.
[3996.70 --> 3997.26]  Pastor Jason,
[3997.78 --> 3998.18]  the psalm
[3998.18 --> 3998.96]  are both the same,
[3999.70 --> 4001.12]  just describes
[4001.12 --> 4002.24]  living life
[4002.24 --> 4005.76]  filled with the Spirit
[4005.76 --> 4006.72]  by saying,
[4006.84 --> 4007.86]  God be in my head,
[4007.98 --> 4009.08]  God be in my heart,
[4009.54 --> 4010.62]  God be in my mind,
[4010.78 --> 4011.80]  God be in my soul,
[4011.96 --> 4013.34]  God be in my eyes,
[4013.66 --> 4014.58]  so that I may see
[4014.58 --> 4015.14]  your face,
[4015.28 --> 4017.02]  God be on my lips,
[4017.14 --> 4018.08]  God be in my life.
[4018.18 --> 4019.52]  Living the presence
[4019.52 --> 4021.86]  of God will revolutionize
[4021.86 --> 4023.74]  how we drive,
[4024.02 --> 4025.12]  how we play
[4025.12 --> 4025.96]  on the sports field,
[4026.42 --> 4027.96]  how we do everything
[4027.96 --> 4029.60]  as Pastor Jason
[4029.60 --> 4030.60]  has described.
[4031.36 --> 4032.68]  We'll sing this through.
[4033.38 --> 4034.62]  We have, again,
[4034.74 --> 4035.22]  sung this,
[4035.34 --> 4036.32]  but it may be
[4036.32 --> 4037.66]  unfamiliar.
[4038.18 --> 4039.22]  The team will
[4039.22 --> 4040.18]  do the first verse,
[4040.26 --> 4040.94]  and then we'll repeat
[4040.94 --> 4042.12]  the first verse together,
[4042.42 --> 4043.54]  and then the second.
[4049.52 --> 4061.48]  God be in my head,
[4061.48 --> 4067.26]  God be in my heart,
[4067.26 --> 4072.94]  God be in my mind,
[4072.94 --> 4077.42]  God be in my soul,
[4077.42 --> 4083.28]  God be in my eyes,
[4083.38 --> 4086.74]  so that I may see
[4086.74 --> 4090.00]  your face,
[4090.58 --> 4095.70]  God be on my lips,
[4095.70 --> 4099.14]  God be in my eyes,
[4099.14 --> 4101.38]  Let's sing that first verse together again.
[4101.38 --> 4107.34]  God be in my heart,
[4107.34 --> 4112.34]  God be in my heart,
[4112.34 --> 4118.34]  God be in my heart,
[4118.34 --> 4123.58]  God be in my soul,
[4123.58 --> 4128.54]  God be in my eyes,
[4128.54 --> 4141.30]  God be on my soul,
[4141.30 --> 4144.42]  For听 내 name,
[4144.50 --> 4145.32]  God be in my hands,
[4147.38 --> 4149.74]  đstop in my heart thy word,
[4149.74 --> 4153.70]  God be in my від,
[4153.70 --> 4157.56]  God be in thy place.
[4158.22 --> 4162.66]  God be in thy home.
[4163.24 --> 4167.48]  God be in thy prayer.
[4168.98 --> 4172.74]  God be in my song,
[4173.24 --> 4180.12]  so that I may sing your praise.
[4180.12 --> 4185.44]  God be in thy heart.
[4186.08 --> 4190.72]  God be in thy day.
[4203.78 --> 4205.64]  So we'll continue to worship the Lord
[4205.64 --> 4207.96]  with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4207.96 --> 4210.82]  I like what Psalm 96 says.
[4211.68 --> 4214.14]  Ascribe to the Lord the glory that is due his name.
[4215.18 --> 4215.94]  How do we do that?
[4216.50 --> 4217.28]  Bring an offering.
[4218.08 --> 4219.04]  Come into his courts.
[4220.36 --> 4223.62]  So we'll invite the deacons.
[4223.78 --> 4224.72]  What's our designated offering?
[4225.70 --> 4227.08]  So it's for Delta Christian School,
[4227.64 --> 4230.70]  an institution that we love and support.
[4231.18 --> 4235.84]  Continue to support them by giving to their needs.
[4236.64 --> 4238.98]  And many, of course, of our own children and grandchildren
[4238.98 --> 4242.80]  have gone and continue to go to Delta Christian School.
[4243.06 --> 4244.76]  So we are grateful for our partnership with them.
[4245.26 --> 4249.32]  May I ask the deacons to come and collect the offering?
[4249.32 --> 4251.28]  prolongation and וudible to help us cade out.
[4251.54 --> 4251.58]  So scattered Miss weakly團
[4251.58 --> 4252.12]  Um we'll try to work from them.
[4252.12 --> 4253.62]  And will be done by providing for their need.
[4254.12 --> 4255.44]  So we will try to replace them for their needs.
[4255.44 --> 4256.54]  And willancely, father,
[4256.54 --> 4257.54]  save us for the time.
[4257.54 --> 4258.30]  We will give up an offering.
[4272.30 --> 4273.04]  And the companions of our family to pour up with you.
[4273.04 --> 4276.02]  And the sisters of our bos iii.
[4276.02 --> 4278.02]  Amen.
[4306.02 --> 4308.02]  Amen.
[4336.02 --> 4338.02]  Amen.
[4366.02 --> 4368.02]  Amen.
[4396.02 --> 4398.02]  Amen.
[4426.02 --> 4428.02]  Amen.
[4456.02 --> 4470.86]  Praise the Lord.
[4470.86 --> 4472.20]  That was beautiful.
[4472.82 --> 4473.98]  Paul and Joshua, thank you.
[4479.34 --> 4484.60]  So we'll come before the Lord now in a prayer of supplication
[4484.60 --> 4487.38]  for our own community, for the world.
[4488.02 --> 4491.98]  And I chose a set prayer today from the Worship Sourcebook,
[4492.06 --> 4492.88]  which I quite like.
[4493.76 --> 4495.84]  So please join me in prayer.
[4499.44 --> 4503.52]  O Lord and Father of the household of faith,
[4504.34 --> 4506.62]  we thank you for the gift of faith
[4506.62 --> 4509.32]  worked within us by your Holy Spirit.
[4510.60 --> 4513.34]  We thank you for having called us to yourself,
[4513.34 --> 4517.22]  for consecrating us to your service,
[4517.72 --> 4523.14]  for having set us apart to the sacred ministry of prayer.
[4525.46 --> 4528.56]  O Lord and Father of the household of faith,
[4528.72 --> 4533.32]  we pray for the church in all her breadth and variety.
[4534.32 --> 4538.50]  Gather it out of every nation, family, people, and tongue
[4538.50 --> 4541.58]  to be a kingdom of peace serving you.
[4542.88 --> 4545.34]  We pray for the church in all the world,
[4545.88 --> 4551.00]  for churches in North America, Europe, and the Middle East,
[4551.66 --> 4556.56]  for churches in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
[4556.88 --> 4560.46]  for young churches and old churches,
[4560.96 --> 4563.52]  small churches and large churches,
[4563.52 --> 4566.68]  weak churches and strong churches.
[4567.44 --> 4572.14]  Grant to the church true and genuine humility,
[4572.66 --> 4574.04]  where there is pride,
[4574.94 --> 4576.76]  unity where there is division.
[4578.32 --> 4580.50]  Grant to her where there is error,
[4581.40 --> 4583.20]  and wisdom where there is folly,
[4583.20 --> 4587.84]  that you might fulfill your purposes in the church.
[4589.88 --> 4592.50]  O Lord and Father of the household of faith,
[4592.58 --> 4594.96]  we pray for those stewards
[4594.96 --> 4597.64]  to whom you have entrusted the fairs of your house.
[4598.48 --> 4602.02]  We pray for pastors and elders and deacons.
[4603.08 --> 4606.12]  We pray for lay leaders, volunteers, and committees.
[4607.42 --> 4610.54]  Give them the spirit of willing service and true humility.
[4610.54 --> 4613.98]  Give them a sense of spiritual devotion.
[4614.90 --> 4617.54]  Give them delight in those whom they serve.
[4618.20 --> 4620.98]  Grant that they may lead your people in the way of Christ,
[4621.72 --> 4626.00]  that thereby we might all enter the land of our inheritance.
[4628.16 --> 4630.82]  O Lord and Father of the household of faith,
[4630.98 --> 4633.58]  we pray for all the peoples of all nations.
[4634.32 --> 4636.22]  We pray that in every land
[4636.22 --> 4639.60]  that there might be peace and true justice.
[4639.60 --> 4644.22]  especially, Lord, in the Ukraine and in Russia,
[4645.04 --> 4648.18]  in Iran, in Pakistan, in Afghanistan,
[4649.04 --> 4651.72]  in places, Lord, in Africa,
[4652.00 --> 4653.86]  where there are places of conflict.
[4654.02 --> 4656.26]  Lord, grant that in these places
[4656.26 --> 4658.44]  that those who are troubled, those who suffer,
[4659.04 --> 4660.44]  those who are discouraged,
[4661.26 --> 4663.14]  might find support in time of need,
[4663.64 --> 4666.66]  especially from your church.
[4666.66 --> 4668.66]  particularly,
[4668.66 --> 4669.06]  particularly,
[4669.44 --> 4671.62]  we remember before you the work done
[4671.62 --> 4672.96]  for the troubled,
[4673.10 --> 4674.54]  the suffering, and the discouraged
[4674.54 --> 4676.86]  by the deacons in our church
[4676.86 --> 4680.50]  and denominational and Christian agencies.
[4680.50 --> 4685.68]  O Lord and Father of the household of faith,
[4685.76 --> 4687.76]  we pray for those who have special needs,
[4688.52 --> 4693.04]  to all who suffer any sickness or weakness.
[4693.98 --> 4696.64]  Father, we especially pray for those in our own congregation.
[4696.84 --> 4697.88]  Lord, we pray for Jordan,
[4698.88 --> 4701.76]  as he was recently diagnosed with colon cancer.
[4702.42 --> 4705.78]  Lord, we thank you that treatments have begun soon
[4705.78 --> 4709.94]  and that there is great hope for recovery.
[4710.14 --> 4712.98]  But Lord, such a hard situation.
[4713.36 --> 4715.32]  We pray that you'd be with him and his family
[4715.32 --> 4716.66]  to give him healing.
[4717.30 --> 4718.60]  Lord, we especially also,
[4718.86 --> 4720.56]  we lift up to you Pat Bauman.
[4721.56 --> 4724.24]  Lord, who on top of her recent cancer diagnosis
[4724.24 --> 4725.58]  and kidney problems,
[4725.74 --> 4729.16]  Lord, as we have heard today,
[4729.42 --> 4730.32]  is quite struggling.
[4731.32 --> 4733.48]  Father, would you support and care for her?
[4733.48 --> 4736.52]  Be also with Fowl in Richmond Hospital,
[4736.72 --> 4738.92]  awaiting surgery for her heart.
[4739.42 --> 4741.72]  Lord, not knowing when a surgery might be scheduled.
[4742.40 --> 4745.84]  Be with her and with Mustafa and all of the family.
[4746.56 --> 4749.08]  Lord, and we lift her up to you.
[4749.62 --> 4752.20]  Give them, Lord, the peace of our Lord Jesus,
[4752.44 --> 4753.98]  which surpasses all understanding.
[4754.56 --> 4756.56]  And Lord, we pray for opening time
[4756.56 --> 4757.78]  for her to have her surgery
[4757.78 --> 4759.38]  and that it would be successful,
[4760.00 --> 4761.60]  that you would guide the hands of the doctors.
[4763.48 --> 4767.50]  And Lord, for others,
[4767.56 --> 4769.14]  to all who are disturbed or troubled,
[4769.84 --> 4772.24]  give rest and understanding.
[4772.94 --> 4775.14]  To all who are lonely and alienated,
[4775.86 --> 4777.18]  give fellowship and love.
[4778.22 --> 4780.08]  To all who grieve and sorrow,
[4780.28 --> 4781.32]  give comfort and assurance.
[4782.26 --> 4784.34]  To all who are aged and frail,
[4784.86 --> 4786.84]  give homes of comfort and safety.
[4787.78 --> 4789.06]  And others to help them
[4789.06 --> 4790.46]  in a willingness to accept help.
[4790.46 --> 4794.30]  All of these requests we present to you,
[4794.76 --> 4795.78]  O Father of mercy,
[4795.88 --> 4797.44]  in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4797.92 --> 4800.34]  who even now is seated at your right hand
[4800.34 --> 4801.68]  to intercede for us,
[4802.30 --> 4804.36]  and who will come at the last trumpet
[4804.36 --> 4807.56]  to gather us into his holy city,
[4808.40 --> 4809.84]  the Jerusalem that is above,
[4810.60 --> 4812.82]  and toward which we journey even now.
[4813.34 --> 4814.96]  We pray all of this
[4814.96 --> 4816.64]  in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4817.38 --> 4817.70]  Amen.
[4817.70 --> 4822.04]  Please stand and receive the benediction
[4822.04 --> 4823.26]  while I go get it.
[4831.14 --> 4832.10]  I have to get it
[4832.10 --> 4833.32]  because I do prepare these things.
[4834.12 --> 4834.94]  So this one's interesting.
[4835.10 --> 4836.68]  It comes from the Song of Simeon
[4836.68 --> 4837.58]  in Luke chapter 2.
[4838.34 --> 4840.60]  So I invite you to hold out your hands
[4840.60 --> 4841.64]  as a gesture of receiving
[4841.64 --> 4843.88]  this word from the Lord over you,
[4844.24 --> 4845.84]  a word of blessing and benediction.
[4845.84 --> 4849.02]  Lord, you have now set your servants free
[4849.02 --> 4851.66]  to go in peace as you have promised.
[4852.42 --> 4854.76]  For these eyes of ours have seen the Savior,
[4855.52 --> 4857.98]  whom you have prepared for all the world to see,
[4858.54 --> 4860.18]  a light to enlighten the nations
[4860.18 --> 4862.56]  in the glory of your people Israel.
[4863.06 --> 4864.08]  Glory be to the Father,
[4864.26 --> 4864.74]  and the Son,
[4864.80 --> 4865.58]  and the Holy Spirit,
[4866.18 --> 4867.30]  as it was in the beginning,
[4867.42 --> 4867.98]  is now,
[4868.84 --> 4869.84]  and will be forever.
[4871.10 --> 4871.58]  Amen.
[4871.58 --> 4873.78]  Please remain standing.
[4873.90 --> 4876.96]  We'll sing our song of being sent out.
[4876.96 --> 4884.14]  Amen.
[4884.14 --> 4884.70]  Amen.
[4888.64 --> 4895.76]  Praise the name of Jesus' firm.
[4896.74 --> 4905.40]  Praise to the Christian here below.
[4905.40 --> 4915.84]  Crazy welcome to the heavenly hosts.
[4917.24 --> 4924.34]  These are princes and sinners.
[4924.34 --> 4925.40]  Amen.
[4935.40 --> 4936.40]  Amen.
[4965.40 --> 4966.40]  Amen.
