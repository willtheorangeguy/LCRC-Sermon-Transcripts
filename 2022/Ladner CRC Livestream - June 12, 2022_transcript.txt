[1056.86 --> 1072.86]  For our time of confession.
[1072.86 --> 1078.86]  Let us confess our sin before God and one another.
[1078.86 --> 1082.86]  With these words based on Isaiah 30, 15 and 18.
[1082.86 --> 1088.86]  In repentance and rest is your salvation.
[1088.86 --> 1092.86]  In quietness and trust is your strength.

[1115.86 --> 1116.86]  God's assurance of forgiveness.
[1116.86 --> 1121.86]  God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of sin is from a very familiar passage.
[1121.86 --> 1125.86]  John 3, 16 and 17.
[1125.86 --> 1130.86]  For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son.
[1130.86 --> 1136.86]  So that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life.
[1136.86 --> 1142.86]  Indeed, God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world.
[1142.86 --> 1149.86]  But in order that the world might be saved through Him.
[1149.86 --> 1150.86]  God's try.

[1360.22 --> 1371.12]  family of god before we come to this table to celebrate the lord's supper together
[1371.12 --> 1378.60]  we confess our faith together so let us recite together the nicene creed
[1378.60 --> 1385.36]  and this will be here on the screen so let's say the nicene creed together very ancient creed that
[1385.36 --> 1393.32]  confesses the triune god we believe in father son and holy spirit we believe in one god the father
[1393.32 --> 1403.82]  almighty maker of heaven and earth of all things visible and invisible and in one lord jesus christ
[1403.82 --> 1413.82]  the only son of god begotten from the father before all ages god from god light from light
[1413.82 --> 1424.72]  true god from true god begotten not made of the same essence as the father through him all things
[1424.72 --> 1434.20]  were made for us and for our salvation he came down from heaven he became incarnate by the holy spirit
[1434.20 --> 1442.52]  and the virgin mary and was made human he was crucified for us under pontius pilate
[1442.52 --> 1451.08]  he suffered and was buried the third day he rose again according to the scriptures he ascended to
[1451.08 --> 1460.08]  heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father he will come again with glory to judge the living
[1460.08 --> 1470.02]  and the dead his kingdom will never end and we believe in the holy spirit the lord the giver of life
[1470.02 --> 1478.64]  he proceeds from the father and the son and with the father and the son is worshiped and glorified
[1478.64 --> 1489.14]  he spoke through the prophets we believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church we affirm one baptism
[1489.14 --> 1497.86]  for the forgiveness of sins we look forward to the resurrection of the dead and to the life in the world to come
[1497.86 --> 1509.38]  amen in luke's account of the last supper where jesus transformed the passover meal into the lord's table
[1509.38 --> 1518.86]  he said to his disciples i have earnestly desired to eat this meal with you and yet i won't eat it again
[1518.86 --> 1526.60]  with you until it's made new in the kingdom and so friends what that means is that every time we come to
[1526.60 --> 1537.60]  the lord's table we are in effect saying come lord jesus come lord jesus inaugurate that final supper of the lamb
[1537.60 --> 1545.24]  inaugurate that time when we will finally feast with you face to face in the fullness of life
[1545.24 --> 1552.14]  we say come jesus and let us have that eternal feast that we all long for in glory
[1552.14 --> 1558.90]  so beloved this table then is for those who have that expectation that one day they will
[1558.90 --> 1565.84]  know jesus and see him face to face and know him in love so if you have not yet trusted
[1565.84 --> 1573.78]  in christ as your savior then this table is not yet for you but let's talk about it after the service
[1573.78 --> 1579.18]  i invite you to find me or find pastor nancy and we would love to talk to you about what it means
[1579.18 --> 1584.88]  to put your trust in jesus christ and that that can be the most important decision that you will ever make
[1584.88 --> 1591.74]  and so we remember the words of the apostle paul that the lord jesus on the night when he was betrayed he
[1591.74 --> 1598.56]  took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you
[1598.56 --> 1606.26]  do this in remembrance of me in the same way he took the cup after supper saying this cup
[1606.26 --> 1614.04]  is the new covenant in my blood as often as you drink it do it in remembrance of me
[1614.04 --> 1621.46]  for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord's death when
[1621.46 --> 1628.06]  until he comes you proclaim the lord's death until he comes come lord jesus
[1628.06 --> 1638.98]  so friends let's say our our words of the liturgy together where we call one another to remember
[1638.98 --> 1646.66]  what we believe brothers and sisters lift up your hearts we are his people

[2256.46 --> 2256.64]  Hi.
[2256.64 --> 2257.22]  Hi.
[2257.22 --> 2258.22]  Hi.
[2258.22 --> 2260.22]  Hi.
[2260.22 --> 2262.22]  Hi.
[2262.22 --> 2263.22]  Hi.
[2263.22 --> 2264.22]  Okay.
[2264.22 --> 2265.22]  Hi.
[2265.22 --> 2266.22]  Hi.
[2266.22 --> 2267.22]  Hi.
[2267.22 --> 2268.22]  Hi.
[2268.22 --> 2270.76]  One of my favorite things about,
[2270.76 --> 2272.72]  do you all hear that ringing or is it just me?
[2272.72 --> 2273.56]  Okay.
[2273.56 --> 2276.84]  One of my favorite things about the summer is camping
[2276.84 --> 2277.98]  and where you get to make s'mores.
[2277.98 --> 2279.56]  And so look what I brought.
[2280.70 --> 2282.64]  Now I see that you're looking at this
[2282.64 --> 2284.10]  and seeing how much I have,
[2285.10 --> 2288.32]  but we're,
[2288.32 --> 2290.72]  this is actually just for illustration purposes.
[2292.28 --> 2293.38]  All right.
[2293.38 --> 2296.32]  So look at this, I have chocolate.
[2296.32 --> 2299.00]  So who knows what goes into a s'more?
[2299.00 --> 2300.08]  What goes in the s'more?
[2302.44 --> 2303.60]  Marshmallow.
[2303.60 --> 2304.72]  I got marshmallow.
[2304.72 --> 2305.56]  Look at this.
[2307.50 --> 2308.34]  Okay.
[2308.34 --> 2310.16]  Crackers.
[2310.16 --> 2311.00]  Yeah. Okay.
[2311.00 --> 2312.72]  So look, I got a marshmallow.
[2313.62 --> 2316.30]  I have a piece of chocolate.
[2316.30 --> 2317.14]  Yum.
[2317.14 --> 2317.96]  And?
[2317.96 --> 2318.80]  Cracker.
[2318.80 --> 2319.64]  A cracker.
[2319.64 --> 2320.48]  And you need two.
[2320.48 --> 2321.38]  You need two crackers actually,
[2322.38 --> 2324.22]  because you're making a sandwich, aren't you?
[2324.22 --> 2326.90]  It's actually really good.
[2326.90 --> 2326.94]  Yeah.
[2326.94 --> 2328.90]  What made me a s'more?
[2328.90 --> 2330.54]  Very nice shoes.
[2330.54 --> 2331.54]  Those are sparkly.
[2331.54 --> 2332.22]  Okay.
[2332.22 --> 2335.64]  So look, this is how you make a s'more,
[2335.84 --> 2336.80]  just in case you forgot.
[2336.94 --> 2337.06]  Ready?
[2337.68 --> 2338.00]  Cracker.
[2338.60 --> 2338.96]  Chocolate.
[2339.72 --> 2340.16]  Marshmallow.
[2340.80 --> 2341.06]  Cracker.
[2341.44 --> 2342.18]  Now, what's missing?
[2342.62 --> 2344.20]  You have to melt it.
[2344.20 --> 2345.26]  You have to melt it.
[2345.54 --> 2347.02]  And the marshmallow.
[2347.24 --> 2347.60]  Yes.
[2348.18 --> 2350.40]  You have to cook it.
[2350.42 --> 2351.12]  You got to cook it.
[2351.18 --> 2351.82]  You got to melt it.
[2351.82 --> 2352.18]  That's right.
[2352.28 --> 2353.62]  So this isn't quite a s'more,
[2353.70 --> 2354.44]  because it has to be cooked.
[2354.60 --> 2356.24]  But this is what a s'more looks like.
[2356.54 --> 2357.98]  Now, why am I talking about this?
[2359.98 --> 2360.72]  I'm going to tell you.
[2361.56 --> 2363.14]  Because it reminds me of God.
[2364.76 --> 2365.12]  Yes.
[2365.68 --> 2366.20]  It does.
[2366.24 --> 2367.22]  This reminds me of God.
[2367.34 --> 2368.06]  Let me tell you why.
[2369.28 --> 2370.64]  Because, let me, okay,
[2370.64 --> 2371.86]  so how many gods are there?
[2372.58 --> 2372.98]  One.
[2374.02 --> 2374.82]  One God, right?
[2375.62 --> 2378.60]  Now, the Bible tells us that we have a heavenly father
[2378.60 --> 2380.82]  who created all things and who loves us.
[2380.82 --> 2382.60]  Is that heavenly father God?
[2383.12 --> 2383.42]  Yes.
[2383.62 --> 2384.10]  Yeah?
[2384.18 --> 2384.88]  Everyone say yes.
[2385.40 --> 2385.84]  Yes?
[2385.96 --> 2386.16]  Okay.
[2386.64 --> 2390.56]  And the Bible tells us that God's son is Jesus Christ,
[2390.72 --> 2395.04]  and he came into this world and died on the cross to save us.
[2395.28 --> 2396.52]  Is Jesus God?
[2397.26 --> 2397.60]  Yes.
[2399.28 --> 2400.70]  Jesus is also God.
[2400.96 --> 2402.04]  Jesus died.
[2402.24 --> 2402.66]  That's right.
[2402.76 --> 2403.02]  He did.
[2403.14 --> 2403.64]  Jesus died.
[2404.22 --> 2405.22]  And, you're right,
[2405.56 --> 2406.82]  in the Holy Spirit,
[2406.90 --> 2408.62]  the Bible tells us there's a Holy Spirit,
[2408.62 --> 2411.90]  and the Holy Spirit works in each one of our hearts
[2411.90 --> 2415.06]  to help us believe in God and to follow Jesus.
[2415.50 --> 2416.28]  You're a God?
[2417.46 --> 2417.90]  Yeah.
[2417.98 --> 2418.92]  So, how many gods are there?
[2419.38 --> 2419.72]  One.
[2420.14 --> 2420.40]  One.
[2420.74 --> 2421.18]  You're right.
[2422.24 --> 2423.80]  So, God is one,
[2424.00 --> 2426.98]  but God exists also in three persons,
[2427.40 --> 2427.74]  Father,
[2428.28 --> 2428.56]  Son,
[2428.82 --> 2429.46]  and Holy Spirit.
[2430.34 --> 2432.44]  So, this is the God we believe in, right?
[2432.48 --> 2433.58]  And this is called the Trinity.
[2434.56 --> 2436.38]  And that's why it reminds me of this.
[2436.74 --> 2438.94]  Now, for the theologians in the room,
[2439.14 --> 2440.16]  I know, I know.
[2440.44 --> 2441.76]  It's not a perfect illustration,
[2441.98 --> 2442.20]  but.
[2443.48 --> 2444.20]  So, look.
[2444.94 --> 2445.36]  God,
[2446.18 --> 2447.26]  the Father is God.
[2447.38 --> 2448.10]  Jesus is God.
[2448.14 --> 2449.14]  The Holy Spirit is God.
[2449.24 --> 2450.84]  They are all equal to God.
[2451.28 --> 2452.90]  They're equal in power,
[2453.08 --> 2453.66]  in glory,
[2453.66 --> 2454.42]  in eternity,
[2454.72 --> 2458.16]  and they exist eternally as one God,
[2458.26 --> 2459.24]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[2459.54 --> 2460.78]  I want to share a poem with you.
[2461.06 --> 2462.08]  We're going to have it on the screen,
[2462.08 --> 2464.38]  so everyone can...
[2464.38 --> 2464.86]  Right, look.
[2464.96 --> 2465.72]  I'm going to have a poem.
[2466.30 --> 2466.94]  Listen to this.
[2467.62 --> 2470.40]  The Bible teaches that our God is one,
[2471.16 --> 2472.72]  made up of three,
[2473.32 --> 2474.72]  Father, Spirit, Son.
[2475.22 --> 2476.66]  Each one is distinct,
[2477.12 --> 2478.28]  yet fully divine,
[2479.02 --> 2480.04]  united, eternal,
[2480.28 --> 2481.62]  in love for all time.
[2482.56 --> 2484.66]  Trinity means the three persons are one.
[2485.12 --> 2487.26]  Our one God is Father,
[2487.86 --> 2488.62]  Spirit, and Son.
[2489.40 --> 2489.64]  Okay?
[2489.64 --> 2493.02]  So I want to share one short verse with you
[2493.02 --> 2493.76]  from the Bible.
[2494.76 --> 2496.00]  This is what it says.
[2498.16 --> 2501.02]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2501.02 --> 2502.92]  and the love of God
[2502.92 --> 2504.78]  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[2504.78 --> 2506.28]  be with you all.
[2508.34 --> 2509.08]  Can you remember that?
[2509.22 --> 2510.40]  God is three in one.
[2510.90 --> 2511.04]  Okay?
[2512.30 --> 2513.60]  Everybody say three in one.
[2514.10 --> 2515.04]  Three in one.
[2515.34 --> 2515.76]  Good job.
[2515.88 --> 2516.26]  Let's pray.
[2516.26 --> 2518.18]  Father, we praise you
[2518.18 --> 2520.08]  for being amazing God.
[2520.70 --> 2522.72]  We thank you for telling us who you are
[2522.72 --> 2524.64]  and helping us to believe in you.
[2525.12 --> 2526.30]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2527.74 --> 2528.06]  All right.
[2528.10 --> 2528.64]  Thank you, everyone.
[2530.22 --> 2530.76]  Go ahead.
[2530.90 --> 2531.60]  Go back to your seats.
[2531.60 --> 2531.68]  Go back to your seats.
[2531.68 --> 2535.14]  Go back to your seats.
[2535.14 --> 2536.30]  Go back to your seats.
[2536.30 --> 2536.68]  Go back to your seats.
[2536.68 --> 2537.42]  Go back to your seats.
[2538.42 --> 2538.80]  Okay.
[2543.48 --> 2543.90]  Sorry.
[2551.56 --> 2552.02]  All right.
[2552.06 --> 2553.40]  And so the children who are
[2553.40 --> 2556.22]  ages three to grade one
[2556.22 --> 2557.22]  may go to their class.
[2557.52 --> 2559.50]  And our Chinese brothers and sisters,
[2559.50 --> 2561.74]  you may go to your worship service
[2561.74 --> 2563.86]  and hear a message in Chinese.
[2587.08 --> 2588.26]  So good morning, everyone.
[2588.26 --> 2590.48]  I'm going to turn this one off.
[2592.30 --> 2592.48]  Okay.
[2594.00 --> 2596.02]  Well, it's good to see you all here this morning.
[2596.86 --> 2599.38]  And last week, we started a new sermon series
[2599.38 --> 2600.96]  called Life Together.
[2601.70 --> 2604.62]  And it's a series that's going to dig deeply
[2604.62 --> 2608.08]  into the question, what is the church?
[2609.34 --> 2611.70]  And we're going to consider what the church is
[2611.70 --> 2614.44]  through this letter that Paul wrote
[2614.44 --> 2615.86]  to the church in Ephesus.
[2615.86 --> 2617.70]  And we're asking this question,
[2617.82 --> 2621.36]  what is the church for several reasons?
[2622.34 --> 2624.76]  And one of those reasons is this,
[2625.36 --> 2628.76]  that we are all coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[2629.46 --> 2633.50]  And it was a time in which instead of life together,
[2633.90 --> 2637.26]  we were told that the best way to live
[2637.26 --> 2638.88]  is actually to live apart.
[2638.88 --> 2642.82]  And that has really had an impact
[2642.82 --> 2644.70]  on every arena of life.
[2645.24 --> 2647.60]  But it really has had an impact,
[2647.76 --> 2650.86]  especially on our ideas
[2650.86 --> 2652.24]  of what it means to be the church.
[2652.24 --> 2655.46]  And we're reminded of the scripture's
[2655.46 --> 2656.86]  proclamation over humanity,
[2656.86 --> 2659.22]  that it is not good for man to be alone.
[2660.22 --> 2662.64]  But that's essentially what we've been forced into
[2662.64 --> 2665.08]  over these last two years,
[2665.10 --> 2666.84]  over the time of the pandemic.
[2667.84 --> 2670.02]  And I think our experience over the last two years
[2670.02 --> 2672.10]  has created a lot of questions.
[2672.18 --> 2672.92]  It has for me.
[2673.90 --> 2675.98]  What does it mean to be a healthy church?
[2675.98 --> 2679.50]  Do we even need the church?
[2680.22 --> 2683.02]  Or can I just live out the Christian life on my own,
[2683.14 --> 2684.28]  in my own way?
[2685.78 --> 2688.52]  And how do we live together as a community anyway?
[2689.14 --> 2691.36]  Because in many ways, it is not easy, is it?
[2692.40 --> 2695.64]  Right, these are questions that I'm thinking about,
[2695.74 --> 2696.26]  I'm asking,
[2696.44 --> 2698.32]  and maybe some of you are asking them as well.
[2698.40 --> 2699.54]  And I will just say right now
[2699.54 --> 2701.30]  that I don't have all the answers.
[2702.18 --> 2704.64]  But I do believe that God has the answers.
[2704.64 --> 2708.78]  And so in order to help us to answer these questions,
[2708.78 --> 2710.04]  we're gonna look to God's word.
[2710.14 --> 2712.14]  And we're gonna spend the next few weeks
[2712.14 --> 2713.46]  studying the book of Ephesians.
[2713.56 --> 2715.28]  Because remember, Ephesians is a letter
[2715.28 --> 2718.44]  written to the church about the church.
[2719.28 --> 2721.54]  It's a book written to teach us
[2721.54 --> 2724.14]  what is this glorious community,
[2724.32 --> 2726.58]  this beautiful community that God has created
[2726.58 --> 2729.78]  in and through Jesus Christ that we call the church.
[2729.78 --> 2735.46]  So last week we started with Ephesians chapter one,
[2735.54 --> 2736.60]  verses one to 14,
[2737.10 --> 2740.44]  which you may recall is one long sentence
[2740.44 --> 2743.78]  in which Paul tells the true story of the whole world
[2743.78 --> 2747.50]  about a God of love who created a people of love.
[2748.70 --> 2751.68]  And Paul wanted to invite us into this story
[2751.68 --> 2753.86]  and find our place in this grand story
[2753.86 --> 2756.28]  because this story that we share
[2756.28 --> 2759.36]  is the basis of our community together.
[2760.68 --> 2764.28]  And today we're looking at Ephesians verses 15 and 23,
[2764.44 --> 2767.60]  which I'll invite Peter to come up and read for us.
[2769.32 --> 2770.62]  Yeah, and so that's the passage for today.
[2770.70 --> 2771.90]  This is the second passage.
[2772.22 --> 2773.94]  It's also one long sentence in the Greek.
[2774.70 --> 2775.78]  So I'll have Peter come and read it.
[2775.78 --> 2789.10]  Ephesians 1, 15 to 23.
[2789.86 --> 2792.32]  For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith
[2792.32 --> 2794.84]  in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
[2794.94 --> 2796.58]  I have not stopped giving thanks for you,
[2797.14 --> 2798.20]  remembering you in my prayers.
[2798.52 --> 2801.22]  I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2801.36 --> 2802.24]  the glorious Father,
[2802.78 --> 2805.00]  may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[2805.00 --> 2806.74]  so that you may know him better.
[2807.28 --> 2808.90]  I pray also that the eyes of your heart
[2808.90 --> 2812.02]  may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope
[2812.02 --> 2813.34]  to which he has called you,
[2814.04 --> 2817.88]  the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints
[2817.88 --> 2822.68]  and the incomparably great power for us who believe.
[2822.98 --> 2825.94]  That power is like the working of his mighty strength,
[2826.56 --> 2829.50]  which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead
[2829.50 --> 2831.90]  and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly realms.
[2831.90 --> 2835.32]  Far above all rule and authority, power and dominion,
[2835.76 --> 2837.08]  and every title that can be given,
[2837.34 --> 2840.64]  not only in the present age, but also in the one to come.
[2841.36 --> 2843.16]  And God placed all things under his feet
[2843.16 --> 2845.86]  and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
[2846.40 --> 2848.38]  which is his body and fullness of him
[2848.38 --> 2850.02]  who fills everything in every way.
[2850.72 --> 2851.68]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2852.46 --> 2859.84]  Thank you, Peter.
[2859.84 --> 2863.36]  So before we dive into this passage,
[2863.52 --> 2866.06]  let's pause and pray and ask for God's help.
[2866.74 --> 2867.62]  Would you please pray with me?
[2870.14 --> 2873.50]  Triune God, thank you for your word to us.
[2874.34 --> 2875.90]  May it deepen our faith,
[2877.38 --> 2879.72]  comfort us, and challenge us
[2879.72 --> 2883.50]  so that we may grow in our love for you and for each other.
[2883.50 --> 2888.32]  In the name of Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit, we pray.
[2889.36 --> 2889.76]  Amen.
[2891.22 --> 2894.50]  So Rafe Vaughn Williams is a composer,
[2895.06 --> 2898.76]  and one of his hymns is called For All the Saints.
[2899.94 --> 2904.64]  And there's a stanza in that hymn that goes like this.
[2904.64 --> 2908.10]  It says,
[2908.32 --> 2910.60]  When the fight is fierce,
[2911.30 --> 2912.56]  the warfare long,
[2913.42 --> 2917.20]  far off we hear the distant triumph song,
[2917.80 --> 2919.60]  and hearts are brave again,
[2920.40 --> 2922.08]  and arms are strong.
[2922.08 --> 2928.38]  So I want to invite you to imagine yourself fighting in a battle.
[2929.16 --> 2930.92]  That's what this hymn invites us to imagine.
[2931.78 --> 2932.96]  So you're fighting in a battle,
[2933.80 --> 2936.36]  and your side is losing.
[2937.24 --> 2938.60]  People are falling.
[2939.50 --> 2941.30]  The enemy is overtaking you,
[2941.56 --> 2943.84]  and you're about to give up.
[2943.84 --> 2946.94]  But suddenly, you hear something,
[2947.68 --> 2952.16]  and what you hear is the song of a marching army off in the distance.
[2953.04 --> 2955.28]  And though the army isn't there yet,
[2955.48 --> 2956.96]  they're right over the hill,
[2958.12 --> 2959.82]  their song is getting louder.
[2960.54 --> 2962.50]  You know that reinforcements,
[2962.90 --> 2964.98]  that guarantee victory, are coming.
[2965.86 --> 2967.82]  And even though they're not here yet,
[2968.84 --> 2971.62]  they're not engaged yet in the battle,
[2972.52 --> 2973.52]  what happens?
[2973.84 --> 2977.40]  Your heart is already braver.
[2978.20 --> 2981.82]  Your arm is already stronger.
[2983.10 --> 2988.48]  The anticipation, the knowledge of what's about to happen changes you.
[2989.02 --> 2992.04]  It affects the way you are now in the moment.
[2992.40 --> 2996.48]  Because your circumstances haven't changed at all.
[2996.92 --> 2997.82]  But what's changed?
[2999.36 --> 3000.30]  Hope.
[3001.38 --> 3002.34]  You have hope.
[3002.34 --> 3002.42]  Hope.
[3003.16 --> 3006.06]  And I think that's what Paul is doing in our passage today.
[3006.50 --> 3010.58]  He's writing to this church in Ephesus to give them hope.
[3010.58 --> 3020.80]  Verses 15 to 23 that Peter read for us is this magnificent prayer that Paul makes for the Ephesian Christians.
[3021.44 --> 3023.48]  And the central idea of the prayer,
[3023.68 --> 3024.72]  and sometimes with Paul,
[3024.80 --> 3026.22]  you have to really look at the grammar,
[3026.22 --> 3028.48]  because it's all one long sentence,
[3028.48 --> 3031.88]  and he just layers prepositional phrase onto prepositional phrase.
[3031.88 --> 3033.58]  But when you look at it,
[3033.58 --> 3038.92]  I believe the central idea of this passage is in verse 18,
[3038.92 --> 3040.66]  where he says,
[3040.66 --> 3046.12]  I pray that you may know the hope to which you are called.
[3046.12 --> 3050.32]  And Paul writes to the Ephesians about hope.
[3050.84 --> 3054.56]  Because he knows how much they need it.
[3055.36 --> 3062.44]  Because remember, he's writing to this letter to this church in the city of Ephesus in the Roman Empire.
[3062.44 --> 3069.72]  So this church, they were living as a minority community under the watchful eyes of this powerful Roman Empire
[3069.72 --> 3072.40]  that was pagan and had emperor worship.
[3072.74 --> 3075.30]  And this was a group of Christians who were believing in Jesus.
[3075.72 --> 3078.08]  But there are people from all over the Roman Empire,
[3078.20 --> 3080.98]  and they're living together, Jews and Gentiles.
[3080.98 --> 3086.30]  But the thing about Jews and Gentiles is that they did not live well together.
[3087.18 --> 3088.98]  They had history between them.
[3089.66 --> 3095.30]  In fact, this history was all kinds of hostility toward one another.
[3095.76 --> 3100.74]  So they're struggling to live together as a unified church, as every church does.
[3101.60 --> 3104.30]  And what he's doing is he's trying to help these people
[3104.30 --> 3108.92]  who have seen one another as enemies, even though they are now Christians,
[3108.92 --> 3111.86]  he's helping them to actually live together.
[3112.92 --> 3116.66]  And so Paul comes to them in this passage, and he says,
[3117.46 --> 3123.10]  You know what, brothers and sisters, I want you to live together as the church.
[3123.54 --> 3126.88]  And the way I'm going to help you to do that is I want to give you hope.
[3127.52 --> 3130.02]  I'm going to remind you of hope.
[3130.76 --> 3135.70]  Because he knows that unless they have hope both for themselves and for one another,
[3135.70 --> 3142.08]  they would not do this difficult work of pursuing unity and community together.
[3143.34 --> 3143.56]  Right?
[3143.64 --> 3149.94]  Only when you have hope can you pursue change, especially in the face of difficulty.
[3149.94 --> 3154.58]  So what I want to do this morning is I want to talk about hope.
[3154.64 --> 3161.70]  And I want to talk about also what it means for us to have hope as we follow Paul in this passage.
[3162.38 --> 3165.82]  And I want to say this morning just simply two things about hope.
[3166.72 --> 3167.82]  And the first is this.
[3167.88 --> 3171.04]  It is first a hope for one another.
[3171.78 --> 3171.92]  Okay?
[3171.94 --> 3172.96]  A hope for one another.
[3172.96 --> 3180.16]  See, Paul in this passage teaches us that he wants us to see one another through the eyes,
[3180.16 --> 3184.90]  not of cynicism and doubt and resignation,
[3185.48 --> 3189.30]  but rather to see one another through the eyes of hope,
[3189.76 --> 3192.00]  through the eyes of redemptive possibility.
[3193.16 --> 3196.08]  Now, why would Paul say this?
[3197.00 --> 3199.22]  Well, on the one hand, because he knows the Bible.
[3199.22 --> 3205.50]  And Paul knows that the Bible teaches that human beings have incredible dignity.
[3206.02 --> 3208.12]  We are created by God.
[3208.36 --> 3210.58]  We are made in the image of God.
[3211.32 --> 3212.82]  We have incredible dignity.
[3212.98 --> 3215.04]  But even though we have fallen into sin,
[3215.76 --> 3218.92]  God promises that he is going to come and he's going to make us new again.
[3219.70 --> 3222.46]  He's going to restore the image of God again.
[3223.40 --> 3226.86]  And so, friends, the story that the Bible tells about human beings
[3226.86 --> 3228.94]  is a story of hope, isn't it?
[3228.94 --> 3230.84]  The whole Bible is a story of hope.
[3231.80 --> 3233.98]  And Paul knows that story.
[3235.04 --> 3237.20]  That's why he's talking to them about hope.
[3238.30 --> 3243.32]  But, you know, he also knows about hope because he has experienced it himself.
[3244.44 --> 3249.34]  Remember, just a few years before Paul wrote this letter to the church in Ephesus,
[3250.02 --> 3251.34]  who was Paul?
[3252.88 --> 3257.76]  Paul was a murderous enemy of God and of the church.
[3257.76 --> 3260.68]  But then what happened?
[3261.62 --> 3262.76]  He met Jesus.
[3263.32 --> 3267.72]  And he became, instead, a lover of God and a lover of the church.
[3268.46 --> 3275.94]  Paul himself knew the power of redemptive hope because he had experienced it in his own life.
[3275.94 --> 3279.50]  So he comes to the church in their need and he says,
[3279.84 --> 3281.60]  I want you to have hope for one another.
[3282.80 --> 3285.46]  But notice in this passage how he does it.
[3286.94 --> 3290.72]  How would you give hope to someone?
[3290.72 --> 3296.04]  Well, you might say, if you're, well, you might say this.
[3296.32 --> 3298.48]  Brothers and sisters, we must have hope.
[3300.22 --> 3301.40]  Have hope, right?
[3301.46 --> 3303.02]  So that would be an exhortation.
[3303.72 --> 3306.08]  But look, Paul doesn't exhort them to hope.
[3306.16 --> 3309.38]  Instead, what he does is he gives them the experience of hope.
[3309.38 --> 3312.64]  That is to say, he has hope for them.
[3313.36 --> 3316.12]  He tells them that he has hope for them.
[3316.72 --> 3319.88]  And so what happens is they experience hope coming from him.
[3320.74 --> 3322.50]  And he does that in two ways in this passage.
[3322.66 --> 3326.64]  First, you see that he has hope for who they are right now.
[3326.64 --> 3332.12]  When he looks at this group of motley group of Christians,
[3332.50 --> 3336.16]  he looks at them through hopeful eyes.
[3336.64 --> 3339.84]  He sees them through the lens of the way God created them to be
[3339.84 --> 3341.64]  and is redeeming them to be.
[3342.78 --> 3345.14]  So in verse 15, this is what he says.
[3345.32 --> 3346.56]  This is the beginning of our passage.
[3347.00 --> 3349.74]  For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus,
[3350.06 --> 3351.54]  your love for all God's people,
[3352.10 --> 3354.32]  I have not stopped giving thanks for you.
[3354.32 --> 3357.00]  This is how Paul sees them.
[3357.74 --> 3361.00]  He sees them as people who are full of faith and love.
[3361.90 --> 3365.78]  And it causes his heart to be full of gratitude to God.
[3367.28 --> 3370.12]  Now, if you know anything about the book of Ephesians,
[3371.02 --> 3373.32]  this may come as a complete surprise to you.
[3373.60 --> 3378.10]  Because the latter half of the letter, which we will look at later,
[3378.78 --> 3382.36]  actually shows that the Ephesians are struggling.
[3382.36 --> 3386.42]  They are struggling with hatred, with cruel words,
[3387.14 --> 3392.26]  with sexual craziness, with drunkenness, with power struggles.
[3393.14 --> 3395.76]  That's actually what the church was dealing with.
[3396.48 --> 3398.76]  And yet, Paul writes this letter and he says,
[3399.16 --> 3401.66]  I see in you faith and love,
[3402.00 --> 3404.40]  and it makes me grateful to God for you.
[3404.40 --> 3407.08]  How can he do that?
[3408.22 --> 3411.26]  It's because he knows that even though people struggle with sin,
[3411.32 --> 3412.74]  and we also struggle with sin,
[3413.52 --> 3416.92]  but by the grace of the Lord Jesus, by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3417.58 --> 3419.34]  that they can have faith,
[3419.92 --> 3421.16]  and that they can have love,
[3421.96 --> 3426.54]  and that those things are actually more fundamentally true about them
[3426.54 --> 3427.66]  than their sin is.
[3427.66 --> 3428.16]  Right?
[3429.12 --> 3430.88]  He can see them through the eyes of hope,
[3430.98 --> 3432.52]  where they are right now.
[3433.98 --> 3436.92]  And he's not being naive about their sin.
[3439.12 --> 3440.34]  He's being a Christian.
[3442.00 --> 3443.68]  This is how Christians are.
[3443.84 --> 3445.94]  We see one another through the eyes of hope.
[3446.04 --> 3446.28]  We don't,
[3447.40 --> 3448.84]  we're not naive about sin,
[3449.30 --> 3451.80]  but we see one another through the eyes of hope.
[3451.80 --> 3455.98]  And Paul, he doesn't only have hope for who they are now,
[3456.06 --> 3458.32]  but also he has hope for who they will become.
[3459.32 --> 3461.76]  We see that in the next verse, in verse 16,
[3462.20 --> 3463.96]  where he says that he's praying for them.
[3465.10 --> 3465.70]  He says,
[3465.80 --> 3467.50]  I have not stopped giving thanks for you,
[3467.64 --> 3469.04]  remembering you in my prayers.
[3470.26 --> 3471.10]  What is prayer?
[3472.72 --> 3474.62]  Prayer is an act of hope.
[3475.82 --> 3477.14]  Prayer is an act of hope.
[3477.62 --> 3477.74]  Right?
[3477.80 --> 3480.44]  It means that you are open to something being different.
[3480.44 --> 3482.92]  You're open to something changing.
[3484.06 --> 3486.42]  And what happens when you stop praying for someone?
[3486.72 --> 3487.74]  If you stop praying for someone,
[3487.82 --> 3490.20]  well, maybe you're just being forgetful.
[3491.08 --> 3493.70]  But if you intentionally stop praying for someone,
[3493.82 --> 3496.68]  what you are saying is that they'll never change.
[3498.20 --> 3500.60]  That transformation in this person cannot happen.
[3501.76 --> 3502.98]  So prayer is an act of hope.
[3503.38 --> 3505.46]  So then he says in the next verse, verse 17,
[3505.46 --> 3508.66]  I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3508.66 --> 3512.78]  the glorious Father may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation,
[3512.96 --> 3514.94]  so that you may know him better.
[3516.12 --> 3518.80]  He says you can actually grow in wisdom.
[3519.54 --> 3521.40]  You can grow in knowledge of God.
[3522.36 --> 3524.08]  This is the truth of who you are,
[3524.18 --> 3526.50]  that you are people filled with faith and love,
[3526.96 --> 3529.56]  and you are people who can grow in wisdom
[3529.56 --> 3531.70]  and in knowledge of God.
[3531.70 --> 3534.92]  So I want you to see that Paul,
[3535.04 --> 3537.48]  as he writes this letter to the church in Ephesus,
[3538.48 --> 3539.96]  he has hope for this church.
[3540.88 --> 3543.54]  Even though they're struggling to live together as the church,
[3543.62 --> 3544.54]  he has hope for them.
[3545.02 --> 3547.10]  And he teaches them to have hope for themselves
[3547.10 --> 3548.22]  and for one another
[3548.22 --> 3550.80]  by telling them that he has hope for them.
[3551.92 --> 3553.36]  He's giving them an example
[3553.36 --> 3555.40]  of how to look at one another with hope
[3555.40 --> 3557.78]  for who they are right now
[3557.78 --> 3559.02]  and who they can become.
[3560.66 --> 3562.06]  So let's pause for a moment.
[3563.18 --> 3565.62]  And I want to encourage each one of us
[3565.62 --> 3568.02]  to some self-reflection,
[3568.34 --> 3569.46]  some self-examination.
[3570.68 --> 3572.54]  When you think about yourself,
[3573.12 --> 3576.22]  think about yourself right now,
[3577.10 --> 3578.42]  when you think about yourself,
[3579.32 --> 3582.48]  do you see yourself through the eyes of hope?
[3582.48 --> 3586.22]  That you have faith and love?
[3588.80 --> 3591.24]  Do you have hope that God can increase
[3591.24 --> 3592.32]  your knowledge of him,
[3592.38 --> 3594.08]  that you can grow in the Christian life?
[3594.70 --> 3597.54]  Do you see that as a possible future for you?
[3599.32 --> 3601.22]  And when you think about other people,
[3602.20 --> 3603.66]  whether it's your spouse,
[3604.36 --> 3605.14]  or your children,
[3606.08 --> 3608.00]  or friends or neighbors you know,
[3608.08 --> 3609.38]  or people in this church,
[3610.00 --> 3612.28]  do you think of them through the eyes of hope?
[3613.42 --> 3615.12]  Or do you think to yourself,
[3616.14 --> 3617.42]  they can never change?
[3618.92 --> 3619.04]  Right?
[3619.12 --> 3621.62]  Are we just kind of quickly consigning people
[3621.62 --> 3624.22]  to whatever we imagine about them,
[3624.64 --> 3626.26]  who they are or who they could be?
[3627.26 --> 3629.90]  Or do we see people through the eyes of redemptive hope?
[3629.96 --> 3630.66]  And I ask,
[3631.18 --> 3632.16]  I want us to ask this question,
[3632.30 --> 3633.84]  how do I see other people?
[3634.84 --> 3635.02]  Right?
[3635.02 --> 3637.04]  Because we can never be the church together.
[3637.04 --> 3640.02]  We can never be the church
[3640.02 --> 3644.52]  unless we are able to see one another
[3644.52 --> 3645.58]  through the eyes of hope.
[3647.70 --> 3650.00]  You know, when I was thinking about this church,
[3650.68 --> 3652.86]  and I just wanted to say,
[3653.18 --> 3654.76]  following the example of Paul,
[3654.76 --> 3659.00]  that I see faith and love in you.
[3660.60 --> 3661.22]  I do.
[3661.40 --> 3662.60]  This is an amazing congregation.
[3663.62 --> 3664.98]  I see the way you sing,
[3665.24 --> 3666.06]  and you praise God.
[3666.82 --> 3668.16]  I see the way that
[3668.16 --> 3671.18]  you are growing in wisdom and knowledge.
[3671.18 --> 3673.84]  It's easy after a long time
[3673.84 --> 3675.00]  to go through the motions,
[3675.36 --> 3676.62]  and sure, we all do that,
[3676.72 --> 3678.32]  but I see you growing.
[3679.64 --> 3681.74]  I see you reaching out
[3681.74 --> 3683.76]  and making room in this church body
[3683.76 --> 3685.40]  to sponsor refugees,
[3686.08 --> 3688.34]  to invite our Chinese brothers and sisters
[3688.34 --> 3689.70]  to become part of this congregation.
[3689.70 --> 3692.82]  And I see you give generously
[3692.82 --> 3695.22]  to the work of God's kingdom
[3695.22 --> 3697.06]  here and around the world.
[3698.26 --> 3698.52]  Right?
[3698.56 --> 3700.00]  You are doing all of these things.
[3700.50 --> 3701.58]  And I want you to see that,
[3701.68 --> 3703.46]  and I give thanks to God for it.
[3704.50 --> 3704.72]  Right?
[3704.78 --> 3706.52]  You already are hopeful people,
[3706.76 --> 3708.10]  and I want to encourage you
[3708.10 --> 3711.36]  to continue to cultivate that hope
[3711.36 --> 3713.26]  because we need hope
[3713.26 --> 3714.28]  to be a church together.
[3716.60 --> 3718.66]  Okay, but here's the second thing
[3718.66 --> 3720.84]  that we see in this passage.
[3721.42 --> 3723.38]  It's not just a hope for one another
[3723.38 --> 3724.38]  that Paul talks about,
[3724.66 --> 3726.46]  but he spends so much of this passage
[3726.46 --> 3727.76]  talking about the fact
[3727.76 --> 3728.68]  that it is a hope
[3728.68 --> 3730.94]  that is founded in God.
[3731.68 --> 3732.96]  It's a hope that's founded in God,
[3733.00 --> 3734.12]  and this is really important
[3734.12 --> 3735.86]  because the only way
[3735.86 --> 3736.68]  that we can have hope
[3736.68 --> 3738.28]  for ourselves and one another
[3738.28 --> 3740.96]  is because God is loving,
[3741.82 --> 3743.18]  and God is powerful,
[3743.36 --> 3744.40]  and God is committed
[3744.40 --> 3747.46]  to making us new.
[3748.66 --> 3749.58]  He is committed
[3749.58 --> 3750.68]  to making you new.
[3750.92 --> 3751.46]  He is committed
[3751.46 --> 3752.84]  to making us as a church new.
[3753.82 --> 3754.52]  And so for Paul,
[3754.60 --> 3755.88]  when we talk about hope,
[3756.36 --> 3757.42]  and he's talking about hope,
[3757.50 --> 3761.56]  it's not just some vague optimism.
[3762.42 --> 3763.28]  It's not just like,
[3763.42 --> 3765.06]  I hope things can be better.
[3765.20 --> 3766.10]  No, it's a hope
[3766.10 --> 3767.02]  that is anchored
[3767.02 --> 3769.12]  in the work of God.
[3770.64 --> 3772.52]  Because Paul is a Christian,
[3773.10 --> 3773.86]  he anchors it
[3773.86 --> 3774.88]  in the work of the Trinity,
[3775.50 --> 3776.96]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[3776.96 --> 3779.40]  So first he says
[3779.40 --> 3780.04]  it's a hope
[3780.04 --> 3783.12]  that is established
[3783.12 --> 3784.98]  by the power of God.
[3785.52 --> 3786.76]  By the power of God.
[3787.36 --> 3788.28]  The hope that we have
[3788.28 --> 3788.90]  for one another
[3788.90 --> 3789.58]  is established
[3789.58 --> 3790.52]  by the power of God.
[3790.64 --> 3791.60]  So in verse 17,
[3792.70 --> 3793.44]  he says,
[3794.08 --> 3795.08]  I'm not going to put it up there
[3795.08 --> 3796.04]  because I have a bunch of verses,
[3796.98 --> 3797.88]  but this is what he says,
[3797.94 --> 3798.66]  and we've read it.
[3798.72 --> 3798.98]  He says,
[3799.06 --> 3799.82]  I keep asking
[3799.82 --> 3800.80]  that the God
[3800.80 --> 3802.08]  of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[3802.38 --> 3803.92]  the glorious Father,
[3804.54 --> 3805.34]  may give you
[3805.34 --> 3806.20]  the spirit of wisdom
[3806.20 --> 3806.80]  and revelation
[3806.80 --> 3809.50]  so that you may know him better.
[3809.72 --> 3810.56]  This whole passage
[3810.56 --> 3811.66]  is Trinitarian.
[3812.92 --> 3813.52]  He says,
[3813.90 --> 3815.00]  the Father gives us
[3815.00 --> 3815.88]  the spirit of wisdom
[3815.88 --> 3816.54]  and revelation
[3816.54 --> 3817.74]  so that we can know him.
[3818.16 --> 3818.68]  And it's that
[3818.68 --> 3819.98]  in knowing God
[3819.98 --> 3821.70]  that we are transformed.
[3822.46 --> 3823.96]  We're transformed by him.
[3825.24 --> 3826.38]  And then in verse 19,
[3826.50 --> 3827.22]  Paul talks about
[3827.22 --> 3828.64]  God's incomparable
[3828.64 --> 3829.34]  great power
[3829.96 --> 3831.74]  for us who believe.
[3831.74 --> 3834.68]  his power
[3834.68 --> 3835.64]  for us.
[3836.78 --> 3837.54]  In verse 20,
[3837.62 --> 3838.80]  we see that the Father
[3838.80 --> 3840.38]  raised Jesus from the dead
[3840.38 --> 3841.46]  and put him
[3841.46 --> 3842.26]  on his throne.
[3843.00 --> 3843.92]  And in verse 22,
[3843.92 --> 3845.22]  we learn that the Father
[3845.22 --> 3846.18]  puts everything
[3846.18 --> 3847.26]  under Jesus' feet.
[3848.72 --> 3849.30]  Okay, so when Paul
[3849.30 --> 3850.38]  looks at the church
[3850.38 --> 3852.00]  and he prays for them,
[3852.04 --> 3852.88]  he's not just being
[3852.88 --> 3853.64]  an optimist,
[3853.88 --> 3854.98]  he's saying that the God
[3854.98 --> 3856.34]  who created all things
[3856.34 --> 3857.62]  is committed
[3857.62 --> 3859.76]  to changing us
[3859.76 --> 3861.28]  by his own power.
[3861.74 --> 3862.40]  So he,
[3862.60 --> 3863.52]  our hope
[3863.52 --> 3864.14]  is founded
[3864.14 --> 3864.90]  on the power
[3864.90 --> 3865.78]  of the Father.
[3867.08 --> 3867.98]  Now secondly,
[3868.18 --> 3869.00]  this hope for Paul
[3869.00 --> 3869.70]  is not just founded
[3869.70 --> 3870.16]  on the power
[3870.16 --> 3870.66]  of the Father,
[3871.00 --> 3871.80]  it's a hope
[3871.80 --> 3873.10]  that is realized
[3873.10 --> 3874.62]  in the life
[3874.62 --> 3875.40]  of the Son.
[3876.82 --> 3877.54]  Because friends,
[3877.62 --> 3878.10]  one of the things
[3878.10 --> 3878.92]  Christians believe
[3878.92 --> 3879.84]  is that if you want
[3879.84 --> 3880.70]  to know what God
[3880.70 --> 3881.94]  is doing in this world,
[3882.06 --> 3882.60]  where do you look?
[3883.50 --> 3884.42]  You look
[3884.42 --> 3886.08]  at Jesus.
[3887.12 --> 3888.02]  Because Jesus
[3888.02 --> 3889.74]  is the fullest expression
[3889.74 --> 3890.58]  of God's
[3890.58 --> 3891.56]  redemptive purposes
[3891.56 --> 3892.46]  in this world.
[3893.38 --> 3894.18]  So when we look
[3894.18 --> 3894.60]  at Jesus,
[3894.72 --> 3895.28]  what do we see?
[3895.60 --> 3896.40]  We see that Jesus
[3896.40 --> 3897.78]  became a human being,
[3898.04 --> 3899.32]  he entered into sin
[3899.32 --> 3900.24]  in the hopelessness
[3900.24 --> 3901.40]  of death
[3901.40 --> 3902.58]  in our situation,
[3903.14 --> 3904.82]  but he was raised
[3904.82 --> 3905.88]  from the dead,
[3906.52 --> 3907.82]  as verse 20 tells us.
[3908.36 --> 3908.84]  He was raised
[3908.84 --> 3909.26]  from the dead.
[3909.32 --> 3910.22]  Now why is that important?
[3911.36 --> 3912.02]  Because you know
[3912.02 --> 3912.62]  what that means.
[3913.16 --> 3913.94]  Jesus was raised
[3913.94 --> 3914.38]  from the dead.
[3914.60 --> 3915.60]  It means that if God
[3915.60 --> 3916.86]  raised Jesus from the dead,
[3916.86 --> 3918.00]  what does that mean
[3918.00 --> 3918.52]  for us?
[3920.04 --> 3921.20]  He can raise us too,
[3921.26 --> 3921.48]  can he?
[3922.42 --> 3923.48]  We can rise
[3923.48 --> 3924.12]  from the dead.
[3925.38 --> 3926.00]  Jesus rising
[3926.00 --> 3926.54]  from the dead
[3926.54 --> 3927.40]  tells us that people
[3927.40 --> 3928.32]  who were dead
[3928.32 --> 3929.78]  can be made
[3929.78 --> 3930.68]  alive again.
[3931.16 --> 3931.30]  Right?
[3931.38 --> 3932.04]  And Jesus has
[3932.04 --> 3933.02]  accomplished this.
[3933.70 --> 3934.84]  He is the first fruits
[3934.84 --> 3936.14]  of the resurrection,
[3936.42 --> 3936.78]  and that means
[3936.78 --> 3937.60]  all of us,
[3937.68 --> 3938.24]  united to him
[3938.24 --> 3938.74]  by faith,
[3939.30 --> 3940.52]  will be like him.
[3942.08 --> 3942.72]  And so what that means,
[3942.80 --> 3942.94]  friends,
[3942.98 --> 3943.60]  is that we believe
[3943.60 --> 3944.54]  God can change us
[3944.54 --> 3945.94]  even from death
[3945.94 --> 3947.24]  to life.
[3949.16 --> 3949.70]  And not only
[3949.70 --> 3950.40]  is Jesus raised
[3950.40 --> 3951.02]  from the dead,
[3951.12 --> 3951.76]  but if you look
[3951.76 --> 3954.18]  at verses 22 to 23,
[3954.66 --> 3955.20]  it says,
[3955.36 --> 3956.02]  and God placed
[3956.02 --> 3956.78]  all things
[3956.78 --> 3957.70]  under his feet,
[3957.94 --> 3958.52]  that is Jesus,
[3959.18 --> 3960.24]  and appointed him
[3960.24 --> 3961.06]  to be the head
[3961.06 --> 3962.00]  over everything
[3962.00 --> 3964.08]  for the church,
[3964.28 --> 3965.94]  which is his body,
[3966.04 --> 3966.84]  the fullness of him
[3966.84 --> 3967.70]  who fills everything
[3967.70 --> 3968.34]  in every way.
[3969.88 --> 3971.10]  It's the very power
[3971.10 --> 3971.66]  of Jesus,
[3971.82 --> 3972.24]  Paul says,
[3972.30 --> 3973.54]  that fills the church.
[3973.60 --> 3974.02]  His body.
[3977.44 --> 3978.22]  And so we're invited
[3978.22 --> 3979.58]  to look at one another,
[3979.72 --> 3981.38]  not with this earthly lens.
[3982.18 --> 3983.16]  We're called to actually
[3983.16 --> 3984.72]  hold on to a biblical hope
[3984.72 --> 3986.52]  that comes from heaven
[3986.52 --> 3987.78]  into the world.
[3988.98 --> 3989.32]  And friends,
[3989.40 --> 3991.40]  our hope for ourselves
[3991.40 --> 3992.48]  and for one another
[3992.48 --> 3993.78]  is not a political program.
[3994.40 --> 3996.30]  It is not a new ideology
[3996.30 --> 3999.08]  of self-acceptance.
[4000.28 --> 4000.94]  Our hope,
[4001.22 --> 4002.16]  excuse me,
[4002.20 --> 4002.36]  sorry,
[4002.36 --> 4004.22]  our hope is in Jesus,
[4004.58 --> 4006.34]  that we can actually
[4006.34 --> 4007.40]  be changed by him.
[4008.82 --> 4009.86]  So Paul's telling us
[4009.86 --> 4011.40]  that this redemptive hope
[4011.40 --> 4012.38]  that we have
[4012.38 --> 4014.00]  is established
[4014.00 --> 4015.28]  by the power of the Father
[4015.28 --> 4016.50]  and it's realized
[4016.50 --> 4018.16]  in the life of Jesus the Son.
[4018.72 --> 4019.30]  And then finally,
[4019.42 --> 4019.90]  Paul says,
[4019.98 --> 4020.40]  there's a hope
[4020.40 --> 4021.06]  that's applied
[4021.06 --> 4022.32]  by the life of the Spirit.
[4023.66 --> 4024.18]  And you know,
[4024.24 --> 4025.02]  sometimes as Christians,
[4025.14 --> 4025.56]  this is,
[4025.78 --> 4025.98]  I think,
[4026.02 --> 4027.32]  often the way we think.
[4027.32 --> 4028.78]  we have this notion
[4028.78 --> 4029.26]  that,
[4029.76 --> 4030.00]  okay,
[4030.08 --> 4031.40]  so the Father is powerful,
[4032.08 --> 4033.16]  he is going to make
[4033.16 --> 4033.90]  all things new,
[4034.42 --> 4035.36]  Jesus Christ,
[4036.06 --> 4037.34]  raised from the dead,
[4037.70 --> 4039.96]  and when we get to heaven,
[4040.14 --> 4041.62]  we're going to see it someday.
[4042.88 --> 4044.32]  And what are we doing now?
[4045.16 --> 4045.96]  We're just hanging out
[4045.96 --> 4047.00]  until that happens.
[4048.18 --> 4048.54]  Friends,
[4048.62 --> 4048.84]  no.
[4048.84 --> 4051.22]  because what we're forgetting
[4051.22 --> 4052.58]  is the Holy Spirit
[4052.58 --> 4054.60]  who right now
[4054.60 --> 4055.56]  is working
[4055.56 --> 4056.98]  to make this happen.
[4057.24 --> 4057.90]  Not someday
[4057.90 --> 4058.70]  when we go to heaven,
[4059.04 --> 4059.98]  right now.
[4060.52 --> 4061.14]  Paul says,
[4061.50 --> 4062.18]  I want God
[4062.18 --> 4063.32]  to give you the spirit
[4063.32 --> 4064.76]  of wisdom
[4064.76 --> 4065.64]  and revelation
[4065.64 --> 4066.64]  so that you may know
[4066.64 --> 4067.32]  God better.
[4067.92 --> 4068.68]  I want the spirit
[4068.68 --> 4070.20]  to enlighten your hearts
[4070.20 --> 4071.30]  to know the hope
[4071.30 --> 4072.08]  that you have.
[4072.94 --> 4073.94]  Right now,
[4073.94 --> 4075.04]  the Holy Spirit
[4075.04 --> 4076.54]  is at work
[4076.54 --> 4077.32]  enlightening
[4077.32 --> 4078.44]  your heart,
[4078.44 --> 4079.44]  giving you hope,
[4079.94 --> 4080.74]  helping you to know
[4080.74 --> 4081.26]  the Father,
[4081.48 --> 4082.26]  giving you wisdom
[4082.26 --> 4083.30]  for the Christian life.
[4084.38 --> 4085.56]  This hope is applied
[4085.56 --> 4086.20]  right now
[4086.20 --> 4087.20]  by the Holy Spirit.
[4088.98 --> 4089.66]  And so for Paul,
[4089.74 --> 4090.48]  the reason that we can
[4090.48 --> 4091.62]  have hope for one another,
[4092.26 --> 4093.34]  the reason that we can
[4093.34 --> 4094.26]  view one another
[4094.26 --> 4095.54]  through the eyes of hope
[4095.54 --> 4096.10]  is because
[4096.10 --> 4097.36]  of God the Father,
[4097.72 --> 4098.38]  God the Son,
[4098.66 --> 4099.64]  and God the Holy Spirit.
[4100.48 --> 4101.66]  It's a hope that is founded
[4101.66 --> 4103.42]  on the triune God.
[4104.68 --> 4105.02]  And friends,
[4105.08 --> 4105.72]  that's Paul's message
[4105.72 --> 4106.14]  of hope.
[4106.72 --> 4107.92]  He's calling Jews
[4107.92 --> 4109.00]  and Gentiles
[4109.00 --> 4110.24]  to have hope
[4110.24 --> 4110.98]  for one another
[4110.98 --> 4112.94]  because God
[4112.94 --> 4113.72]  is working
[4113.72 --> 4114.34]  among them.
[4115.08 --> 4116.06]  That is the basis
[4116.06 --> 4116.68]  of their hope.
[4117.38 --> 4117.92]  And that's part
[4117.92 --> 4118.36]  of what it means
[4118.36 --> 4119.02]  to live together
[4119.02 --> 4119.60]  as the church,
[4119.66 --> 4120.30]  is to have hope
[4120.30 --> 4120.92]  for one another.
[4121.48 --> 4122.56]  Because Jesus Christ
[4122.56 --> 4123.50]  is raised from the dead,
[4123.72 --> 4124.28]  and the Father
[4124.28 --> 4125.14]  is powerful,
[4125.30 --> 4125.94]  and he is working,
[4126.22 --> 4126.80]  and the Spirit
[4126.80 --> 4127.48]  is with us.
[4128.62 --> 4129.52]  And what he has
[4129.52 --> 4130.76]  called us to do,
[4131.18 --> 4131.84]  which is to be
[4131.84 --> 4132.68]  the church together,
[4133.72 --> 4134.88]  he will enable.
[4134.88 --> 4136.78]  because it's a hope
[4136.78 --> 4137.50]  that is founded
[4137.50 --> 4139.40]  on the triune God.
[4141.32 --> 4142.20]  So let me pray
[4142.20 --> 4142.78]  for us now.
[4143.42 --> 4143.94]  Let me pray
[4143.94 --> 4144.54]  that God would
[4144.54 --> 4145.20]  grant us hope.
[4149.20 --> 4149.62]  Father,
[4149.74 --> 4150.32]  you know that
[4150.32 --> 4151.52]  it is so much
[4151.52 --> 4152.46]  easier for us
[4152.46 --> 4153.78]  in some ways
[4153.78 --> 4156.10]  to renounce hope,
[4156.62 --> 4157.84]  to decide that
[4157.84 --> 4158.96]  we already know
[4158.96 --> 4160.20]  what things
[4160.20 --> 4162.68]  can and cannot be.
[4163.96 --> 4164.98]  But you also know
[4164.98 --> 4166.10]  that what you call us
[4166.10 --> 4166.78]  to is to be
[4166.78 --> 4167.46]  a community,
[4168.48 --> 4169.18]  the church
[4169.18 --> 4170.80]  of redemptive possibility,
[4171.46 --> 4172.22]  to imagine
[4172.22 --> 4173.20]  something different,
[4173.42 --> 4173.96]  and to trust
[4173.96 --> 4174.90]  that you can do it
[4174.90 --> 4176.18]  because you want
[4176.18 --> 4176.66]  to do it.
[4178.02 --> 4178.62]  And so, Lord,
[4178.70 --> 4179.66]  we ask for hope.
[4180.02 --> 4180.78]  We need hope.
[4181.74 --> 4182.66]  It is beautiful,
[4182.84 --> 4183.40]  and we need it.
[4184.44 --> 4185.42]  Help us to learn
[4185.42 --> 4186.20]  from you
[4186.20 --> 4187.56]  in your word
[4187.56 --> 4188.92]  about what it means
[4188.92 --> 4190.22]  to see each other
[4190.22 --> 4191.02]  through the eyes
[4191.02 --> 4191.50]  of hope
[4191.50 --> 4192.96]  because we have
[4192.96 --> 4193.50]  hope in you.
[4194.18 --> 4194.76]  Strengthen us
[4194.76 --> 4195.24]  in that hope,
[4195.32 --> 4197.04]  we pray through Christ.
[4197.74 --> 4198.08]  Amen.
[4200.02 --> 4201.14]  So as I was thinking
[4201.14 --> 4202.06]  about that stanza
[4202.06 --> 4202.92]  I shared earlier
[4202.92 --> 4203.42]  with you,
[4203.50 --> 4203.78]  I thought,
[4203.88 --> 4203.98]  well,
[4204.02 --> 4204.54]  we should sing
[4204.54 --> 4205.30]  that hymn.
[4206.18 --> 4207.58]  Maybe it's not
[4207.58 --> 4208.16]  on our list.
[4208.26 --> 4208.74]  It might not be
[4208.74 --> 4209.58]  familiar to you,
[4210.12 --> 4211.42]  but some of you
[4211.42 --> 4211.92]  may know it.
[4211.98 --> 4212.82]  I grew up singing it,
[4212.88 --> 4213.62]  so please stand
[4213.62 --> 4215.64]  and let's try
[4215.64 --> 4216.36]  singing the song
[4216.36 --> 4218.42]  for all the saints.
[4218.92 --> 4221.32]  the song
[4221.70 --> 4223.78]  Gudd stop
[4223.84 --> 4223.96]  by the
[4226.36 --> 4227.48]  sound of the
[4233.80 --> 4234.48]  cool
[4234.52 --> 4235.18]  ...
[4235.30 --> 4235.58]  ...
[4235.98 --> 4236.54]  ...
[4236.54 --> 4240.08]  ...
[4240.18 --> 4241.14]  ...
[4241.14 --> 4241.70]  ...
[4241.70 --> 4242.14]  ...
[4242.14 --> 4242.20]  ...
[4242.20 --> 4242.66]  ...
[4242.66 --> 4243.38]  phrases
[4243.38 --> 4244.32]  ...
[4244.32 --> 4245.58]  ...
[4245.58 --> 4262.48]  For all the saints who from their labors passed,
[4262.48 --> 4270.60]  who to the world by faith their Lord confessed,
[4270.60 --> 4278.60]  your name, O Jesus, be forever blessed.
[4278.60 --> 4289.60]  Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4289.60 --> 4298.60]  You were their rock, their fortress, and their might.
[4298.60 --> 4307.60]  You, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight,
[4307.60 --> 4315.60]  and in the darkness their unfailing light.
[4315.60 --> 4326.60]  Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4326.60 --> 4356.60] 
[4356.60 --> 4365.60]  Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4365.60 --> 4395.60] 
[4395.60 --> 4404.60]  Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4404.60 --> 4413.60]  Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4413.60 --> 4430.94]  From earth's wide bounds, crowned on to setting sun,
[4430.94 --> 4448.18]  Through heaven's gates, through God the three in one, they come to sing the song on earth begun.
[4448.18 --> 4459.18]  Alleluia! Alleluia!
[4460.94 --> 4477.98]  We will now continue our worship by the giving to God of our tithes and offerings as an expression of gratitude
[4477.98 --> 4482.48]  for who God is and what he has done in our lives and is doing in the world.
[4483.04 --> 4487.08]  Our designated offering today is for just our local church ministries.
[4487.08 --> 4493.68]  And so this would include our Sunday school, our gems and cadets and our youth, our friendship club,
[4493.68 --> 4496.86]  the many other ministries that we have.
[4496.86 --> 4501.22]  So I'll invite our acid deacons to come and help collect the offering.
[4501.22 --> 4503.22]  Thank you.
[4503.22 --> 4504.22]  Thank you.
[4504.22 --> 4508.22]  Thank you.
[4508.22 --> 4515.22]  Thank you.
[4515.22 --> 4517.22]  Thank you.
[4517.22 --> 4519.22]  Thank you.
[4519.22 --> 4526.22]  Thank you.
[4526.22 --> 4528.22]  Thank you.
[4528.22 --> 4530.22]  Thank you.
[4530.22 --> 4532.22]  Thank you.
[4532.22 --> 4539.22]  Thank you.
[4539.22 --> 4541.22]  Thank you.
[4541.22 --> 4543.22]  Thank you.
[4543.22 --> 4545.22]  Thank you.
[4545.22 --> 4556.22]  Thank you.
[4556.22 --> 4557.22]  Thank you.
[4557.22 --> 4560.22]  Thank you.
[4560.22 --> 4561.22]  Thank you.
[4561.22 --> 4562.22]  Thank you.
[4562.22 --> 4563.22]  Thank you.
[4591.22 --> 4592.22]  Thank you.
[4592.22 --> 4593.22]  Thank you.
[4593.22 --> 4594.22]  Thank you.
[4594.22 --> 4595.22]  Thank you.
[4595.22 --> 4596.22]  Thank you.
[4596.22 --> 4597.22]  Thank you.
[4597.22 --> 4598.22]  Thank you.
[4598.22 --> 4599.22]  Thank you.
[4599.22 --> 4600.22]  Thank you.
[4600.22 --> 4601.22]  Thank you.
[4601.22 --> 4602.22]  Thank you.
[4602.22 --> 4603.22]  Thank you.
[4603.22 --> 4607.22]  So let us now pray together as we lift up our prayer concerns to the Lord.
[4607.22 --> 4612.22]  Would you please pray with me?
[4612.22 --> 4620.22]  Heavenly Father, in the very beginning you spoke light into the darkness.
[4620.22 --> 4627.22]  Lord Jesus, eternal Son of the Father, your life was the light of all humanity.
[4627.22 --> 4631.22]  Your light shines in the darkness.
[4631.22 --> 4640.22]  Holy Spirit, you who hovered over the dark waters in the beginning, you shine the light of the Father in the Son into our hearts,
[4640.22 --> 4646.22]  that we may see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[4646.22 --> 4657.22]  And yet we confess with the Apostle John that though the world was made through you, Lord Jesus, the world did not recognize you or see your light.
[4657.22 --> 4665.22]  Only by your grace do we see your light and understand darkness for what it is.
[4665.22 --> 4674.22]  And so, Father, we pray for the ministries of our church.
[4674.22 --> 4683.22]  We thank you for the many ways your light is already shining in our Sunday school and in our children's ministries,
[4683.22 --> 4692.22]  and in the Friendship Club and in Basic Skills Camp happening this summer, and in the small groups that are meeting.
[4692.22 --> 4698.22]  And Lord, in each of these places we proclaim the redemption and the hope that we have in Jesus.
[4698.22 --> 4711.22]  And Lord, would you stir us to engage in these ministries by participating and by serving where help is needed, that we might all experience your grace and all proclaim it.
[4711.22 --> 4717.22]  And Lord, we lift up to you also our church family.
[4717.22 --> 4723.22]  Father, this morning we pray especially for children who have been newly born.
[4723.22 --> 4732.22]  We pray for mothers-to-be and people of every age, especially, Lord, the elderly living in care homes.
[4732.22 --> 4737.22]  Lord, would your grace be abundant in every heart and in every need.
[4737.22 --> 4745.22]  And Father, as we relearn how to live together as the church, as restrictions are lifted and we are able to live life together,
[4745.22 --> 4760.22]  Lord, would you help us as a church to reach out to one another, to be willing to do the hard work of coming and seeing one another and talking to one another.
[4760.22 --> 4770.22]  Father, of Lord, allowing your Holy Spirit to be at work as we try to live out what it means to be the church together.
[4770.22 --> 4774.22]  Father, we also lift up to you our world.
[4774.22 --> 4784.22]  Lord, we continue to ask that you would bring an end to the war in Ukraine, where we cannot see an end to the darkness.
[4784.22 --> 4792.22]  Lord, we pray for the millions upon millions of Ukrainians who are displaced from their homes and taking refuge in other countries.
[4792.22 --> 4798.22]  Lord, and we pray for all refugees throughout the world, including here in Canada.
[4798.22 --> 4802.22]  Would you shine your light where people can only see darkness?
[4802.22 --> 4811.22]  Would you strengthen your church, including this church, to continue to shine the light of your mercy and sacrificial love?
[4811.22 --> 4817.22]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we pray in the hope that the darkness will not overcome the light.
[4817.22 --> 4823.22]  For we come to you in the name of our resurrected Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4823.22 --> 4827.22]  And we pray in his holy name. Amen.
[4827.22 --> 4829.22]  Please stand.
[4829.22 --> 4834.22]  When we receive these words of benediction, I invite you to hold out your hands.
[4834.22 --> 4846.22]  May God, the Holy Trinity, make you strong in faith and love, defend you on every side, and guide you in truth and peace.
[4846.22 --> 4853.22]  And may the blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always. Amen.
[4857.22 --> 4859.22]  Amen.
[4859.22 --> 4870.22]  Amen.
[4870.22 --> 4872.22]  Amen.
[4872.22 --> 4877.22]  Amen.
[4877.22 --> 4883.22]  Praise the Lord,
[4883.22 --> 4888.22]  from whom all blessings flow.
[4888.22 --> 4898.22]  He has washed and made me white as snow.
[4898.22 --> 4908.22]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[4908.22 --> 4920.22]  Now and forever, praise His holy name.
[4920.22 --> 4930.22]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[4930.22 --> 4942.22]  To love me the glory now and forever, praise His holy name.
[4942.22 --> 4953.22]  God is great and greatly to be praised.
[4953.22 --> 4964.22]  Above all others let His name be raised.
[4964.22 --> 4974.22]  Saints and angels evermore proclaim
[4974.22 --> 4980.22]  that He alone is worthy.
[4980.22 --> 4986.22]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[4986.22 --> 4996.22]  Praise His holy name. Praise His holy name.
[4996.22 --> 5008.22]  To love me the glory now and forever, praise His holy name.
[5008.22 --> 5022.22]  To love me the glory now and forever, praise His holy name.
[5022.22 --> 5030.22]  Praise His holy name.
[5030.22 --> 5033.22]  So that concludes our time of worship this morning together.
[5033.22 --> 5038.22]  But we have a members meeting immediately here following the worship service.
[5038.22 --> 5041.22]  So if you are not a member, you are dismissed.
[5041.22 --> 5043.22]  You may freely go, enjoy some coffee.
