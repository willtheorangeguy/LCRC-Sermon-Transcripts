[0.00 → 23.16] Are you alone?
[23.16 → 24.16] Amen.
[53.16 → 55.16] Amen.
[83.16 → 85.16] Amen.
[113.16 → 115.16] Amen.
[143.16 → 145.16] Amen.
[173.16 → 175.16] Amen.
[203.16 → 205.16] Amen.
[233.16 → 235.16] Amen.
[263.16 → 265.16] Amen.
[293.16 → 295.16] Amen.
[295.16 → 296.16] Amen.
[296.16 → 297.16] Amen.
[297.16 → 298.16] Amen.
[298.16 → 299.16] Amen.
[299.16 → 300.16] Amen.
[300.16 → 301.16] Good morning.
[301.16 → 305.16] Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[305.16 → 307.16] And we are gathered in his name.
[307.16 → 309.16] So my name is Jason True.
[309.16 → 312.16] I'm one of the pastors here along with Nancy Young.
[312.16 → 317.16] And it is a pleasure to worship the Lord with you this morning.
[317.16 → 323.16] So here's a question for us this morning, especially on a day like this, which is why are we gathered here?
[323.16 → 326.16] Why are we gathered here this morning?
[326.16 → 329.16] There are other places we could be.
[329.16 → 342.16] But very simply, we are here to worship and praise our God, the one who created us, the one who redeems us, the one who sustains us on this journey of faith.
[342.16 → 360.16] And while we gather this morning, we are mindful of the promise that Jesus gave us in Matthew 18, verse 20, where he says, for where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them.
[360.16 → 365.16] And I think we have made our, our, what's the word?
[365.16 → 366.16] Quorum.
[366.16 → 370.16] So the Lord is here with us.
[370.16 → 376.16] We will be having our offering actually later on in the service now.
[376.16 → 377.16] That's a change.
[377.16 → 382.16] And so we will be collecting the offering in person after the sermon later on.
[382.16 → 386.16] So now the Lord calls us to worship.
[386.16 → 392.16] We believe that God who created absolutely everything welcomes us, and he calls us to worship him.
[392.16 → 396.16] So let's join together in this call of worship this morning.
[396.16 → 400.16] And our call to worship comes from Psalm 63.
[400.16 → 405.16] And where it has the double arrow, I'll ask you to say it out loud with me.
[405.16 → 409.16] You, God, are my God.
[409.16 → 411.16] Earnestly I seek you.
[411.16 → 413.16] I thirst for you.
[413.16 → 420.16] My whole being longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
[420.16 → 425.16] I will praise you as long as I live.
[425.16 → 429.16] And in your name, I will lift my hands.
[429.16 → 435.16] I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods.
[435.16 → 439.16] With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.
[441.16 → 446.16] I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
[446.16 → 451.16] Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
[451.16 → 458.16] Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.
[458.16 → 460.16] Would you please pray with me?
[462.16 → 467.16] Eternal, unchanging, mysterious, and mighty God.
[467.16 → 473.16] You are not only good, but you are indeed great.
[473.16 → 478.16] And so we join this morning with every creature in the sea, every flying bird,
[478.16 → 485.16] every mountain and valley of this earth, every star and moon and all the universe.
[485.16 → 491.16] And we recognize that you rule us by your word and your spirit.
[491.16 → 497.16] Only you are worthy of all honour and glory and praise that is due your name.
[497.16 → 503.16] And so we worship you this morning, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever.
[503.16 → 505.16] Amen.
[505.16 → 508.16] Friends, please rise if you are able.
[508.16 → 513.16] Our God now greets us with these words from Psalm 73.
[513.16 → 516.16] Whom have I in heaven but you?
[516.16 → 519.16] And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
[519.16 → 528.16] My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forevermore.
[528.16 → 535.16] As the Lord has greeted us, let us now turn and greet one another.
[535.16 → 544.16] We worship you this morning from Psalm 73.
[544.16 → 546.16] We worship you.
[546.16 → 551.16] Amen, General, Lord hug you!
[551.16 → 555.16] Amen, Lang, freed you close me outside.
[555.16 → 574.44] Everyone needs compassion
[574.44 → 578.04] And loud hearts never failing
[578.04 → 584.76] Let mercy fall on me
[584.76 → 588.20] Everyone needs forgiveness
[588.20 → 591.80] The kindness of a Saviour
[591.80 → 598.12] The hope of nations
[598.12 → 610.48] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[610.48 → 613.92] My God is mighty to save
[613.92 → 617.92] He is mighty to save
[617.92 → 624.16] Forever, path of salvation
[624.16 → 628.48] He rose and conquered their grave
[628.48 → 633.92] Jesus conquered their grave
[633.92 → 639.20] So take me as you find me
[639.20 → 642.80] All my fears and failures
[642.80 → 648.40] Will my life forget?
[648.40 → 653.84] I give my life to follow
[653.84 → 657.84] Everything I believe in
[657.84 → 663.84] Now I surrender
[663.84 → 667.28] Yes, I surrender
[667.28 → 674.72] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[674.72 → 678.72] My God is mighty to save
[678.72 → 682.72] He is mighty to save
[682.72 → 690.16] Forever, path of salvation
[690.16 → 694.16] He rose and conquered their grave
[694.16 → 698.16] Jesus conquered their grave
[698.16 → 701.60] Jesus, shine your light
[701.60 → 705.04] Let the whole world sing
[705.04 → 709.04] We're singing for the glory
[709.04 → 712.48] Of the risen King
[712.48 → 714.48] Jesus, shine your light
[714.48 → 716.48] Let the whole world sing
[716.48 → 718.48] We're singing for the glory
[718.48 → 720.48] Of the risen King
[720.48 → 723.92] For the risen King
[723.92 → 727.92] For the glory of the risen King
[727.92 → 733.92] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[733.92 → 735.36] My God is mighty to save
[735.36 → 738.36] My God is mighty to save
[738.36 → 740.36] He is mighty to save
[740.36 → 742.36] He is mighty to save
[742.36 → 748.36] Forever, path of salvation
[748.36 → 752.36] He rose and conquered their grave
[752.36 → 756.36] Jesus conquered their grave
[756.36 → 762.36] Saviour, He can move the mountains
[762.36 → 765.60] My God is mighty to save
[765.60 → 766.12] He will my grace to save
[766.12 → 766.80] My God is mighty to save
[766.80 → 768.76] My God is mighty to save
[768.76 → 771.28] He is mighty to save
[771.28 → 784.80] Forever, path of salvation
[784.80 → 790.10] ях higher, path of salvation
[790.10 → 817.10] My hope is built on nothingness
[817.10 → 822.22] Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[822.22 → 830.22] I do not trust His sweetest friend
[830.22 → 836.98] My holy trust in Jesus' name
[836.98 → 845.10] Christ our Lord, cornerstone
[845.10 → 852.10] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[852.66 → 863.10] Through this storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[863.10 → 873.80] When darkness seems to hide His face
[873.80 → 880.42] I rest on His unchanging grace
[880.42 → 887.42] In every high and stormy gale
[887.42 → 892.98] My anchor holds within the air
[892.98 → 899.98] My anchor holds within the air
[899.98 → 907.98] Christ our Lord, cornerstone
[907.98 → 914.98] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[914.98 → 925.98] Through this storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[925.98 → 936.98] When He shall come with trumpet sound
[936.98 → 943.98] Oh, may our name in Him be found
[943.98 → 949.98] Dressed in one's righteousness alone
[949.98 → 955.98] Full blessed and before the throne
[955.98 → 962.98] Marks alone, cornerstone
[962.98 → 970.98] Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
[970.98 → 972.98] The Saviour's love
[972.98 → 983.98] Through this storm He is Lord, Lord of all
[983.98 → 990.98] Lord of all
[990.98 → 993.98] The Saviour's love

[1019.98 → 1021.98] O God, my Father
[1021.98 → 1026.98] There is no shadow of love turning with Thee
[1026.98 → 1031.98] Thou changeest not
[1031.98 → 1032.98] Thou changes not
[1032.98 → 1033.98] Thou changes not
[1033.98 → 1034.98] Thy compassions
[1034.98 → 1036.98] They fail not
[1036.98 → 1039.98] Thou hast been
[1039.98 → 1041.98] Thou forever will be
[1041.98 → 1047.98] Thou forever will be
[1047.98 → 1051.98] Great is Thy faithfulness
[1051.98 → 1053.98] Great is Thy faithfulness
[1053.98 → 1067.98] faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see
[1067.98 → 1081.98] thy hand has provided
[1083.98 → 1091.98] summer and winter and springtime and harvest
[1091.98 → 1097.98] sun blue and stars in their courses
[1097.98 → 1099.98] of
[1099.98 → 1107.98] joined with all nature in manifold with praise
[1107.98 → 1111.98] to thy great faithfulness
[1111.98 → 1115.98] mercy and love
[1115.98 → 1119.98] great is thy faithfulness
[1119.98 → 1123.98] great is thy faithfulness
[1123.98 → 1131.98] morning by morning new mercies I see
[1131.98 → 1135.98] all I have needed
[1135.98 → 1139.98] thy hand has provided
[1139.98 → 1141.98] great is
[1141.98 → 1143.98] thy faithfulness
[1143.98 → 1151.98] lord unto me
[1151.98 → 1153.98] pardon for sin
[1153.98 → 1159.98] and the peace that endures
[1159.98 → 1161.98] thy own dear presence
[1161.98 → 1167.98] to cheer and to guide
[1167.98 → 1171.98] strength for today and burn
[1171.98 → 1175.98] hope for tomorrow
[1175.98 → 1177.98] blessings
[1177.98 → 1179.98] blessings
[1179.98 → 1181.98] blessings
[1181.98 → 1183.98] all my
[1183.98 → 1185.98] with ten thousand days
[1185.98 → 1199.98] great is
[1199.98 → 1201.98] great is
[1201.98 → 1207.76] I have needed, I am God's provided.
[1209.14 → 1217.04] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1217.04 → 1218.04] Amen.
[1228.18 → 1233.60] So now we'll continue to worship the Lord by entering into a time of confession.
[1234.42 → 1241.08] It's a great opportunity to realize our great need before the Lord.
[1241.08 → 1247.40] And to come to him and to acknowledge that need to him.
[1248.28 → 1251.44] And to look to him for his love and his grace.
[1252.72 → 1258.08] Later in the sermon, we'll be thinking about the way in which Jesus provides for all of our needs.
[1259.28 → 1264.50] And that includes our need for his forgiveness and for his righteousness.
[1265.94 → 1267.92] So we come to this time of confession.
[1267.92 → 1275.22] As we do so, let's bring to the Lord all of our sins, all of our struggles, our brokenness.
[1275.48 → 1281.34] And let us look to him for healing and forgiveness that he freely gives us through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1281.96 → 1285.54] So let's say this brief prayer together.
[1286.30 → 1286.94] I'll begin.
[1287.64 → 1291.92] Let us come with humble and repentant hearts to the Lord.
[1293.64 → 1296.72] We all, like sheep, have gone astray.
[1296.72 → 1300.54] Each of us has turned to our own way.
[1301.06 → 1305.80] And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[1307.28 → 1315.58] Hear us now, Father, as we come to you expressing our own need and our own sin to you.
[1316.06 → 1320.04] Looking to Christ who bore our sin in our place.
[1320.04 → 1320.18] Amen.
[1320.18 → 1320.26] Amen.
[1320.26 → 1320.30] Amen.
[1320.30 → 1320.34] Amen.
[1326.72 → 1346.60] Brothers and sisters, focus now on these words of assurance and comfort from the book of Lamentations.
[1346.60 → 1347.60] Amen.
[1347.60 → 1351.28] But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope.
[1352.90 → 1356.04] The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[1356.86 → 1359.40] His mercies never come to an end.
[1359.96 → 1361.74] They are new every morning.
[1362.40 → 1364.40] Great is your faithfulness.
[1364.94 → 1367.92] Brothers and sisters, hear the good news.
[1368.30 → 1370.56] In Jesus Christ, you are forgiven.
[1371.34 → 1372.60] Thanks be to God.
[1372.60 → 1381.62] As those who have been forgiven and made whole by the saving work of Jesus, let's stand and sing together of his grace.
[1381.62 → 1397.64] Blood can wash away my sin.
[1397.64 → 1401.70] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1402.48 → 1406.80] Blood can make me whole again.
[1406.80 → 1411.10] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1411.10 → 1421.06] Oh, precious is the flow that makes me white as snow.
[1421.66 → 1425.68] No other fount I know.
[1426.30 → 1430.08] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1430.08 → 1436.64] For my heart and this I sing.
[1436.64 → 1440.78] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1440.78 → 1446.14] For my blessing this might be.
[1446.14 → 1450.32] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1450.32 → 1460.52] Oh, precious is the flow that makes me white as snow.
[1460.52 → 1465.16] No other fount I know.
[1465.16 → 1469.52] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1469.52 → 1499.50] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1499.50 → 1505.12] No other fount I know.
[1505.12 → 1509.48] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1511.20 → 1516.28] This is all my hope and peace.
[1516.28 → 1520.66] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1520.66 → 1525.78] This is all my righteousness.
[1525.78 → 1530.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1530.86 → 1532.86] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1532.86 → 1549.66] For my such love that makes me white as snow.
[1549.84 → 1551.20] This is all my congee Giovanni.
[1551.20 → 1554.68] This is all my reception love and peace.
[1554.68 → 1569.10] Please join me in prayer.
[1571.68 → 1579.48] Lord Jesus, we thank you that you come to give us not what we think we need,
[1579.48 → 1589.40] but what you know we need, which is your life, spiritual bread, spiritual food, a life with you,
[1590.36 → 1593.10] a restored life with God, our Heavenly Father.
[1593.92 → 1599.96] And so would you give us what we deeply need today at this moment at your table
[1599.96 → 1606.70] to come to you in faith and to receive this gift of grace from your hands.
[1606.70 → 1609.82] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1614.18 → 1620.72] So let's confess together as we prepare to come to the Lord's table the faith of the church in all times
[1620.72 → 1624.78] and in all places by reciting the Apostles' Creed.
[1625.66 → 1628.14] And I think it's appropriate for us to stand as we say this.
[1628.26 → 1629.58] So let's stand once in a while.
[1631.88 → 1633.28] And let's say this together.
[1633.28 → 1639.78] I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1640.78 → 1645.84] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[1646.74 → 1651.98] who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1652.44 → 1658.40] He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1658.40 → 1660.62] He descended to hell.
[1661.20 → 1663.96] The third day he rose again from the dead.
[1664.68 → 1671.04] He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[1671.84 → 1675.70] From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1675.70 → 1684.76] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[1685.22 → 1689.30] the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1690.02 → 1690.50] Amen.
[1690.84 → 1691.50] You may be seated.
[1694.34 → 1698.32] Brothers, this is the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1698.32 → 1702.98] And so the question is, well, who is invited to this table?
[1704.36 → 1710.84] And the answer is that this table is for those who know that they can't come to this table on their own.
[1712.22 → 1722.78] This table is for those who know that they are not worthy in themselves,
[1722.88 → 1724.90] who are not good enough in themselves.
[1724.90 → 1729.32] And if you think you are, then this table is not for you.
[1732.74 → 1738.00] And so this table is for those who have responded to Jesus in faith,
[1738.86 → 1743.84] who have responded in being baptized into his church.
[1744.80 → 1748.64] And if that is you today, then Jesus welcomes you to this table.
[1748.80 → 1751.38] He bids you to come and to feed on him.
[1751.38 → 1756.74] If you're not sure whether you're a Christian, we are so glad that you are here.
[1757.56 → 1764.22] And what a great moment for you to consider responding to Christ in faith
[1764.22 → 1768.98] and turning to him and putting your life into his hands.
[1773.38 → 1778.10] Let's see what I can do here.
[1778.10 → 1778.14] Let's see what I can do here.
[1781.38 → 1811.36] Let's see what I can do here.
[1811.38 → 1813.38] Let's see what I can do here.
[1813.38 → 1814.24] Let's see what I can do here.
[1814.24 → 1817.42] We proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1819.72 → 1823.50] So friends, as we come to the Lord's table, would you turn your eyes up to the screen?
[1823.90 → 1829.10] And we're going to use these words to approach the Lord's table today and to receive this meal.
[1830.08 → 1831.16] Lift your hearts.
[1832.90 → 1834.84] We lift them up to the Lord.
[1835.58 → 1837.00] We are his people.
[1838.08 → 1840.44] We are redeemed by his grace.
[1840.44 → 1843.34] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1844.42 → 1845.52] Christ has died.
[1846.06 → 1847.00] Christ is risen.
[1847.58 → 1849.16] Christ will come again.
[1849.82 → 1852.52] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1853.02 → 1853.36] Hallelujah.
[1853.36 → 1853.56] Hallelujah.
[1855.14 → 1859.32] The gifts of God for you, the people of God.
[1860.70 → 1866.40] And so now we will come forward, as we have been over the last quite a while now,
[1866.56 → 1867.90] to receive the elements.
[1868.74 → 1871.62] And I'd just like to reiterate one or two things.
[1872.82 → 1876.08] One is, please relax.
[1877.08 → 1878.08] Take your time.
[1878.08 → 1882.86] I know some people, you know, we still feel a little bit uncomfortable coming forward.
[1883.36 → 1886.80] And if that is you, you may remain seated.
[1886.94 → 1890.48] Kind of raise your hand, and we have an usher in the back who can bring the element to you.
[1890.64 → 1891.74] There's not that many of them.
[1891.98 → 1894.08] So for most of you, you'll be coming forward.
[1895.44 → 1897.42] And as you do, please just take your time.
[1898.06 → 1904.46] As you come forward, I want to invite you to come as households, whether a couple or a family.
[1905.18 → 1906.00] Come forward.
[1906.20 → 1906.98] Stand together.
[1907.82 → 1911.26] The elder serving will give each of you the bread.
[1911.26 → 1914.84] And then he will say, this is the body of Christ for you.
[1914.86 → 1915.90] And you all eat together.
[1916.46 → 1918.36] And then together, move on to the next station.
[1918.76 → 1922.04] So you'll come down the aisle, go across, and then go back.
[1922.12 → 1924.38] And there's little bins for you to put your cups at the end.
[1925.80 → 1926.00] Okay?
[1926.38 → 1930.58] So let's celebrate our Passover lamb.
[1931.14 → 1932.06] This is now.
[1932.90 → 1934.62] And could you come forward?
[1935.26 → 1936.60] And we will distribute the elements.
[1936.60 → 1939.94] And here we will learn as само Font Hall.
[1939.94 → 1942.78] Let's do the Yaojajidig crossings.
[1943.40 → 1945.16] And now we take the какое-c Essential giving.
[1945.50 → 1946.48] And love us for the Bronze Flag.

[1950.00 → 1950.88] Amen

[1951.16 → 1953.38] And love us for this place.

[2441.34 → 2443.34] Amen.
[2471.34 → 2473.34] Amen.
[2498.34 → 2499.04] Let's pray.
[2501.34 → 2508.58] Our gracious heavenly father, we give you praise for sending your beloved son, our Lord
[2508.58 → 2516.56] Jesus Christ, to come leave his glory in heaven, to come in humility, to take the very form
[2516.56 → 2521.18] of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man, he
[2521.18 → 2527.04] humbled himself and was obedient to death even on the cross.
[2527.04 → 2534.86] And God raised him again from the dead, he ascended to heaven and reigns now over all,
[2534.86 → 2540.36] where every knee will bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[2540.36 → 2547.20] And Lord, we thank you that you have called us to be your people, to be citizens of your
[2547.20 → 2552.98] kingdom and that you as our king sustain us both physically and spiritually with all we
[2552.98 → 2553.98] need.
[2553.98 → 2559.86] Thank you for feeding us now at this table and would your grace through your spirit
[2559.86 → 2564.54] enable us to follow you as we go from here later on.
[2564.54 → 2565.54] We pray in Jesus name.
[2565.54 → 2566.54] Amen.
[2566.54 → 2572.54] Okay, so now, I want to invite your children to come.

[2640.38 → 2640.44] . . . . . . . . May.
[2640.44 → 2645.32] Say, mom or dad, grandmother, I would really like something.
[2646.54 → 2647.40] How about, what do you think?
[2647.52 → 2647.72] Yeah?
[2648.00 → 2649.02] You have asked for presents?
[2649.66 → 2650.48] What have you asked for?
[2650.92 → 2651.46] Do you want to share?
[2652.44 → 2652.66] No?
[2652.80 → 2653.48] Okay, that's fine.
[2655.06 → 2656.78] Anybody want to share something they've asked for?
[2658.66 → 2660.52] Well, here, let me ask you a question then.
[2660.52 → 2667.66] Has anybody ever asked for a rock?
[2667.66 → 2670.96] Have you asked for a rock?
[2671.04 → 2673.70] You say, mom, I really want a new rock.
[2674.32 → 2674.68] Yes?
[2677.78 → 2678.30] Okay.
[2679.06 → 2680.28] I have another question.
[2680.66 → 2683.66] Has anybody ever asked snake?
[2684.48 → 2685.30] Well, maybe you have.
[2685.82 → 2686.52] As a pet.
[2687.24 → 2687.72] Okay.
[2688.26 → 2689.30] Well, that doesn't work as well.
[2690.86 → 2696.12] You know, my daughter Ellie, who is sitting over there, one time, we lived in the country,
[2696.12 → 2699.64] and there are two kinds of snakes that lived where we lived.
[2699.94 → 2704.54] One was a black snake, and black snakes are big, but they're not very dangerous.
[2705.00 → 2707.10] The other kind of snake is called a copperhead.
[2707.92 → 2709.28] Copperheads are dangerous.
[2709.28 → 2714.90] And she once caught, when she was alive, a baby copperhead.
[2715.04 → 2719.44] And she put it into a bug cage, and she showed it to us.
[2719.50 → 2722.60] And it was angry, and it was like darting all around.
[2722.98 → 2725.60] She caught a baby venomous snake.
[2726.60 → 2732.42] And so I felt like a very bad father for giving my daughter a poisonous snake.
[2732.42 → 2737.02] So this reminds me of something that Jesus taught us.
[2738.52 → 2748.42] He says, which of you, if his son or daughter asks for a fish,
[2750.20 → 2752.42] or asks for a stone, would give...
[2753.06 → 2753.32] Sorry.
[2753.32 → 2753.92] Okay.
[2759.66 → 2760.10] Okay.
[2760.52 → 2761.64] I do know this verse.
[2763.02 → 2767.20] Which of you, if your son or daughter asked for bread, would give him a stone?
[2769.30 → 2771.38] If your dad or mom asked...
[2771.38 → 2774.00] You asked them for bread, would they give you a stone?
[2774.52 → 2777.04] Everyone say, no, no, no.
[2777.04 → 2786.20] If you asked your mom or dad for a fish to eat, would they give you a snake?
[2787.06 → 2789.80] Everyone say, no, no, no.
[2791.20 → 2797.04] Then, if your mom and dad, even though Jesus says they're...
[2797.70 → 2802.02] Now, they're not evil, but they're not perfect in every way.
[2802.02 → 2802.10] Okay.
[2803.16 → 2807.34] So even though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.
[2808.12 → 2815.40] How much more will your father and him give good gifts to those who ask of him?
[2816.68 → 2821.76] So just like your mom or dad, they're not going to give you a rock if you ask for bread.
[2821.80 → 2825.02] They're not going to give you a snake if you ask for a fish.
[2825.20 → 2826.22] They're not going to do that.
[2826.22 → 2833.18] Even more, your heavenly father, God, will give you good things if you ask for him.
[2833.98 → 2834.14] Okay.
[2834.34 → 2837.88] Your heavenly father loves to give you good gifts.
[2838.18 → 2843.92] And that means you can ask him for anything you need in life.
[2844.32 → 2844.66] Okay.
[2844.74 → 2845.52] Can you remember that?
[2846.22 → 2848.48] We can pray to God, and we can ask him for what we need.
[2849.20 → 2849.52] Okay.
[2851.12 → 2852.54] Everyone say, okay.
[2853.62 → 2854.06] Awesome.
[2854.06 → 2854.74] Okay.
[2854.82 → 2856.26] Let me pray for us.
[2857.70 → 2863.66] Heavenly father, we thank you that you are a good father, that we can ask you for anything
[2863.66 → 2864.28] we need.
[2864.68 → 2868.26] And you are so good that you give us good gifts.
[2868.82 → 2870.38] You do not give us bad things.
[2871.40 → 2874.20] We thank you and praise you in Jesus name.
[2874.54 → 2874.88] Amen.
[2876.00 → 2876.56] Okay.
[2876.84 → 2877.36] Go ahead.
[2877.36 → 2877.42] Go ahead.
[2884.06 → 2896.56] So the children now, the youngest set, grade three, age three to grade one, can go to their
[2896.56 → 2897.76] Sunday school classes.
[2898.02 → 2900.04] Also, our Chinese ministry friends can go.
[2900.04 → 2917.02] And so we have been going through a sermon series on the Lord's Prayer, going line by line,
[2917.12 → 2919.32] learning how the Lord taught us to pray.
[2919.32 → 2925.62] And so today we will be looking at the fourth petition, give us today our daily bread.
[2925.88 → 2931.56] But before we do, I want to invite Bai Yang to come and read the scripture for us in Mandarin.
[2931.56 → 2961.54] Thank you.
[2961.56 → 2962.56] Amen.
[2962.56 → 2963.56] Amen.
[2963.56 → 2964.56] Amen.
[2964.56 → 2965.56] Amen.
[2965.56 → 2966.56] Amen.
[2966.56 → 2967.56] Amen.
[2967.56 → 2992.54] And we will also read now from the Heidelberg Catechism, question 126.
[2992.54 → 2996.88] What does the fourth petition mean?
[2998.88 → 3007.48] Please, together, give us today our daily bread means, do take care of all our physical needs
[3007.48 → 3013.74] so that we come to know that you are the only source of everything good.
[3013.74 → 3023.86] And that neither our work and worry nor your gifts can do us any good without your blessing.
[3024.94 → 3031.22] And so help us to give up our trust in creatures and trust in you alone.
[3032.44 → 3034.08] Would you please join me in prayer?
[3034.08 → 3039.18] Our Heavenly Father, we desire so many things.
[3039.78 → 3044.68] But ultimately, our hunger, we know, is for you.
[3046.08 → 3048.88] And you have the words of life.
[3049.88 → 3052.74] Lord Jesus, you are the bread of life.
[3052.74 → 3056.36] And so we bring ourselves to you this day.
[3057.02 → 3060.00] You know what is going on with each of us.
[3060.58 → 3061.92] You know our needs.
[3062.58 → 3065.86] And we look to you to provide the sustenance we need.
[3066.50 → 3071.08] Especially, Lord, the spiritual nourishment that comes through your word.
[3071.08 → 3074.18] And so we ask that you would do that now.
[3074.90 → 3076.30] By your Holy Spirit.
[3077.18 → 3078.84] In Jesus' name we pray.
[3079.46 → 3079.86] Amen.
[3081.68 → 3085.84] One of my favourite comics growing up was Garfield.
[3086.88 → 3088.32] Second to Calvin and Hobbes.
[3088.52 → 3089.76] But I like Garfield as well.
[3090.82 → 3096.84] And once in a while there would be a comic strip about the milkman.
[3097.66 → 3098.72] Like this one here.
[3098.72 → 3101.44] I don't know how well you can see it.
[3101.46 → 3101.94] Oh, pretty well.
[3102.52 → 3103.68] So you hear this laughing.
[3103.80 → 3104.32] Ha, ha, ha.
[3104.88 → 3107.82] And then crash, crash, crash.
[3108.86 → 3110.42] Quit tickling the milkman.
[3111.88 → 3115.38] So you can imagine this milkman carrying all these balls of milk.
[3115.56 → 3116.42] Garfield tickling him.
[3116.48 → 3117.12] They're all crashing.
[3117.30 → 3118.68] And of course, Garfield, what does he want?
[3119.38 → 3121.68] He wants to drink the milk, right?
[3121.72 → 3122.80] Because that's Garfield.
[3124.20 → 3126.44] For me as a young child reading Garfield,
[3126.44 → 3132.60] this idea of daily deliveries of milk was really novel to me.
[3133.00 → 3134.70] We didn't have that at my house.
[3136.04 → 3140.30] And so it was hard to imagine the time when many people did not have a refrigerator.
[3141.04 → 3144.12] Where they could store milk for more than a day.
[3144.82 → 3148.78] And when, you know, where there would be a milkman who would come daily to your house
[3148.78 → 3150.74] and deliver milk to his customers.
[3150.74 → 3156.20] I don't know, maybe some of you have, when you were young, had milk delivered to your house.
[3156.26 → 3158.58] I'd be really curious to hear how that works.
[3159.72 → 3165.16] And I think even now in our current day, this idea probably feels even stranger.
[3165.50 → 3166.50] Right now, what do we do?
[3166.58 → 3167.32] We go to Costco.
[3168.12 → 3171.16] We load up our trunks full of food.
[3171.42 → 3173.48] We bring it home, and we load up our fridge.
[3173.56 → 3174.56] We load up our freezer.
[3174.88 → 3177.20] Our pantries are filled with food.
[3177.20 → 3180.22] And now this is a huge blessing.
[3181.04 → 3187.26] But it does sometimes make it difficult for us to understand and relate to this prayer
[3187.26 → 3193.62] where we ask God to give us today our daily bread.
[3195.86 → 3199.50] But I think if we look at this fourth petition carefully,
[3199.78 → 3202.52] there are some things that we can take away from it.
[3202.52 → 3208.02] And so in our time together this morning, I want to draw attention briefly to three things
[3208.02 → 3211.64] that I think Jesus is teaching us to pray when we say,
[3212.02 → 3213.52] give us today our daily bread.
[3213.98 → 3219.54] And he's going to tell us about our provider, our provision, and our prayer.
[3220.16 → 3221.36] So let's look at these together.
[3221.50 → 3222.42] First, our provider.
[3222.90 → 3228.84] When we look at scripture, one of the simplest questions that we can always ask is,
[3229.06 → 3231.44] what does this passage tell me about God?
[3231.44 → 3232.00] Okay?
[3233.42 → 3234.58] Kids, especially, listen.
[3235.56 → 3239.20] When you read the Bible, one of the questions we can always ask is,
[3239.42 → 3243.20] what does this passage tell us about who God is?
[3246.34 → 3253.04] And the first thing to say about this petition is that we are addressing God as our provider.
[3253.66 → 3254.88] That's who God is.
[3255.28 → 3256.60] God is our provider.
[3256.90 → 3261.34] We are invited to ask our Heavenly Father for our needs.
[3261.44 → 3264.38] And that's no small thing, is it?
[3266.06 → 3270.80] Especially when you consider what we've just prayed in the Lord's Prayer.
[3270.94 → 3275.48] We're praying to the one whose name is hallowed.
[3276.26 → 3278.30] Whose name is holy.
[3279.38 → 3279.62] Right?
[3279.62 → 3282.80] We are praying to the king of the kingdom.
[3282.80 → 3291.64] We are praying to the one who can accomplish his will on earth as it is in heaven.
[3292.12 → 3300.42] And this God, this king, invites us to bring our requests before him.
[3300.42 → 3307.04] It reminds me of this hymn by John Newton, the same writer who also wrote Amazing Grace.
[3307.46 → 3308.58] And this is what he wrote.
[3309.54 → 3311.20] Thou art coming to a king.
[3311.98 → 3314.68] Large petitions with thee bring.
[3315.06 → 3319.62] For his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much.
[3320.98 → 3321.86] Hear what he's saying there?
[3322.16 → 3323.40] You're coming to a king.
[3323.40 → 3325.72] The king of the entire universe.
[3325.90 → 3328.98] You can, that means we can bring big prayers to God.
[3330.00 → 3331.78] Anything we need.
[3332.28 → 3334.74] Everything when we get to the end of ourselves.
[3335.50 → 3340.66] We can't find it in ourselves or in anyone else to provide for what we most need.
[3341.06 → 3342.00] We can go to God.
[3342.92 → 3343.54] He is able.
[3343.54 → 3348.66] And this is very special.
[3349.78 → 3353.18] You don't find this in the pagan religions of the first century.
[3353.30 → 3357.10] This kind of fatherly care that God has for his people.
[3357.94 → 3358.16] Right?
[3358.24 → 3361.70] What a privilege that we have to call God our father.
[3363.04 → 3368.04] And when we look to God as our provider, we're affirming that God not only creates the world.
[3368.76 → 3372.30] He's not only the one who says, you know, let there be light.
[3372.30 → 3375.86] But he is also the one who sustains the world.
[3376.46 → 3379.20] He gives you and I our every breath.
[3380.24 → 3382.20] We forget that so often, don't we?
[3382.60 → 3388.04] Every breath we take is God's provision to us.
[3388.94 → 3393.42] He is the one in whom we live and move and have our being.
[3394.40 → 3399.02] He is the one who sustains and nourishes his whole creation.
[3399.02 → 3403.84] If he would withdraw his hand for a moment, the universe would unravel.
[3405.84 → 3414.90] And so when we pray this prayer, we're affirming that he is the one who sustains and nourishes us and the entire universe.
[3415.56 → 3417.42] Give us today our daily bread.
[3417.48 → 3418.58] We're looking to him.
[3418.58 → 3424.54] And on this topic of God as provider, let's look together at Psalm 104.
[3425.56 → 3427.28] We'll look at verse 14.
[3427.78 → 3430.08] This is a psalm about God as provider.
[3431.08 → 3439.52] It says, he makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for people to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth.
[3439.52 → 3442.98] Do you see God's provision here?
[3444.12 → 3447.52] This is the Christian doctrine that is called providence.
[3448.30 → 3451.56] God is our nourished and our provider.
[3452.64 → 3454.50] He makes grass grow for the cattle.
[3455.54 → 3458.16] He makes plants for people to cultivate.
[3458.86 → 3461.70] He brings forth food from the earth.
[3462.20 → 3463.20] God is our provider.
[3464.46 → 3465.84] The providence of God.
[3465.84 → 3467.72] And let's look at the next verse.
[3468.12 → 3472.84] Verse 15 says, he also provides wine that gladdens human hearts.
[3473.04 → 3474.74] Oil to make their faces shine.
[3475.18 → 3477.62] And bread that sustains their hearts.
[3478.76 → 3478.96] Right?
[3479.04 → 3482.12] Not only our health, but also our happiness.
[3482.90 → 3485.10] All good things come from our Lord.
[3486.88 → 3493.04] And when we pray this prayer, we're affirming that God is the one who is able to provide for all of our needs.
[3493.04 → 3497.60] I heard this quote attributed to an indigenous First Nations chief in Canada.
[3498.72 → 3499.60] He said this.
[3499.64 → 3500.60] It's very cool.
[3501.62 → 3503.08] Human beings are like my pigs.
[3504.00 → 3508.22] They eat the apples, but they never look up to see where the apples have fallen from.
[3510.62 → 3512.14] You can just imagine that, right?
[3512.36 → 3514.68] Pigs don't look up and wonder, right?
[3514.74 → 3516.58] They're just looking on the ground.
[3516.68 → 3517.54] They're looking for what to eat.
[3518.42 → 3519.34] Are we the same way?
[3519.34 → 3525.84] Our Heavenly Father delights to bless His children with their daily needs.
[3527.06 → 3533.04] And it is to this generous God that we pray, give us today our daily bread.
[3534.30 → 3538.14] And we look to Him and ask Him for our daily needs.
[3538.86 → 3543.36] He delights to give us what we need because He's our Heavenly Father.
[3543.36 → 3550.86] You know, when our Father is holy, and He's so far above us, who are we that He is mindful of us?
[3550.92 → 3557.46] And yet, at the same time, He is so intimately concerned with the very details of our lives.
[3557.52 → 3558.36] He knows our hearts.
[3558.52 → 3560.70] He knows our needs and our wants and our desires.
[3562.26 → 3567.10] And so praying this prayer honours God as the giver.
[3567.10 → 3571.70] And that leads us to the second point this morning, our provision.
[3572.88 → 3577.74] One of the things you might notice right away with this prayer is that when we come to the fourth petition,
[3578.34 → 3580.06] is that Jesus shifts pronouns.
[3581.08 → 3586.18] The Lord's Prayer starts with your name, your kingdom, your will, right?
[3586.22 → 3587.16] It's Body-centred.
[3588.42 → 3592.94] But now, some of us, we might be saying, finally, get to the good stuff.
[3592.94 → 3596.54] Some of us might be feeling a little bit uncomfortable.
[3597.02 → 3599.30] Now we're kind of, suddenly the spotlight is on us.
[3599.38 → 3605.50] But we now shift to give us, forgive us, lead us.
[3606.64 → 3612.58] And it may appear at first glance that Jesus is really just switching directions on us, right?
[3612.60 → 3617.36] And that we started with the big stuff, you know, God's glory, His kingdom, His will.
[3618.20 → 3621.76] And now, why are we talking about this ordinary stuff of life, daily bread?
[3621.76 → 3624.38] How do we go from kingdom to bread?
[3625.48 → 3630.96] The glorious, the big, to the most mundane, simple staples of life.
[3632.60 → 3638.88] And the thing is, we might think that God really is changing directions, but that is not what is happening at all.
[3639.80 → 3643.26] When we start off with praying for God's name to be hallowed,
[3644.58 → 3646.82] well, the question we might ask is, where?
[3647.44 → 3649.20] Where is God's name hallowed?
[3649.20 → 3652.92] When we pray, your kingdom come, your will be done.
[3654.40 → 3655.84] Great, but where?
[3656.26 → 3660.12] Where does God's kingdom come and where would His will be done?
[3660.18 → 3661.98] And the answer is here.
[3662.62 → 3666.16] Right here in my ordinary daily life.
[3666.30 → 3671.02] When we're praying for God's name to be hallowed, His kingdom to come, His will be done,
[3671.02 → 3676.42] that is God's kingdom and His will coming to my life.
[3678.08 → 3684.48] Heaven coming into my earthly, mundane, ordinary reality.
[3685.00 → 3686.46] My everyday life that I live.
[3687.36 → 3687.52] Right?
[3687.60 → 3693.32] Our heavenly Father desires for His kingdom rule to govern all things.
[3693.72 → 3695.36] All things on earth.
[3695.66 → 3696.58] Not just in heaven.
[3697.40 → 3698.54] We're bringing it down.
[3698.54 → 3699.48] It's real.
[3700.48 → 3704.36] He governs all things, including your life, your every need.
[3705.24 → 3706.90] Even your daily bread.
[3710.30 → 3716.60] He wants us to live out His kingdom.
[3718.18 → 3724.24] And He provides for us to do so by giving us, His children, what we need.
[3724.24 → 3726.14] So He teaches us to pray.
[3726.30 → 3727.98] Give us today our daily bread.
[3728.66 → 3732.44] You know, Martin Luther, the early reformer from the 16th century, he asked,
[3732.76 → 3734.92] well, what is meant by daily bread?
[3735.44 → 3739.48] And he answers, daily bread means everything we need.
[3740.68 → 3741.72] Everything we need.
[3741.86 → 3743.12] Food, of course.
[3743.64 → 3744.08] Drink.
[3745.38 → 3747.38] Clothes, also.
[3748.34 → 3749.40] Homes to live in.
[3749.40 → 3750.40] Relationships.
[3750.40 → 3751.24] Relationships.
[3751.38 → 3751.96] Friendship.
[3753.04 → 3754.76] Work to do in the world.
[3755.50 → 3756.82] We need good government.
[3757.84 → 3759.72] We need health and hospitals.
[3760.38 → 3762.68] Everything necessary for life in the world.
[3763.26 → 3765.58] Everything necessary for living the kingdom life.
[3766.24 → 3767.80] That's what's included in this prayer.
[3768.04 → 3769.92] Give us today our daily bread.
[3770.38 → 3772.18] It's our daily needs being met.
[3772.18 → 3777.60] And this prayer says, give us today our daily bread.
[3778.24 → 3778.72] Today.
[3779.02 → 3782.42] Because today is the day when we live out the kingdom life.
[3783.16 → 3787.20] This is the day that we live our God's will in our lives.
[3787.56 → 3790.28] I don't know about you, but I'm often thinking about tomorrow.
[3793.68 → 3797.88] I'm thinking, well, how can I live for God next year?
[3797.88 → 3803.00] What will God have me do for his kingdom in the future?
[3804.52 → 3808.20] But what does Jesus say to Packages when he comes to his house?
[3809.78 → 3813.36] Today, salvation has come.
[3814.56 → 3816.40] Now is the time of salvation.
[3817.94 → 3819.64] Give us today our daily bread.
[3820.12 → 3822.02] God's kingdom come today.
[3822.84 → 3824.86] In this ordinary day.
[3825.76 → 3826.32] Every day.
[3826.32 → 3827.48] It doesn't have to be in the future.
[3828.34 → 3829.12] Some imagined.
[3829.74 → 3830.80] Ideal time.
[3831.94 → 3834.00] God's time is every time.
[3834.52 → 3834.94] Every day.
[3836.98 → 3843.86] This daily dependence on God to provide for us is a reference to Exodus 16.
[3844.48 → 3849.16] Where God provided the daily needs of his people during their time in the wilderness.
[3850.20 → 3851.74] You probably remember the story.
[3852.40 → 3853.02] What happens?
[3853.14 → 3853.74] The Israelites.
[3854.44 → 3854.80] Not yet.
[3855.52 → 3856.82] Well, you can leave it there.
[3856.82 → 3857.92] No, leave it off.
[3858.68 → 3862.58] The Israelites have been freed from slavery in Egypt.
[3863.52 → 3864.54] And so what are they doing now?
[3864.60 → 3866.90] Well, they're wandering in the wilderness, right?
[3867.10 → 3869.38] They're heading to the promised land.
[3869.50 → 3870.84] But they're not yet there.
[3871.00 → 3873.84] There is a land flowing with milk and honey.
[3874.38 → 3876.10] The future of God's kingdom come.
[3876.10 → 3878.28] But how about today?
[3879.48 → 3880.82] Well, they're out of food.
[3881.78 → 3885.64] The whole community starts to grumble and complain to Moses.
[3886.04 → 3889.14] They say, when we were in Egypt, we were slaves.
[3889.28 → 3892.16] But at least we had pots of meat to eat.
[3892.46 → 3893.44] We weren't starving.
[3893.64 → 3897.32] Moses, did you bring us into the middle of the desert to starve us to death?
[3897.96 → 3898.88] Is this your plan?
[3899.20 → 3901.36] They're just complaining and grumbling to Moses.
[3901.36 → 3905.54] So God hears the cries of his people, and he's going to provide for them.
[3905.70 → 3910.60] Not just in the future in the land flowing milk and honey, but today in the wilderness.
[3912.26 → 3913.52] But how is he going to do it?
[3914.26 → 3919.36] Is he going to suddenly give them a big storehouse full of food like they had in Egypt?
[3919.42 → 3924.28] Where they can just kind of go into this big pantry and get whatever they need whenever they want?
[3924.28 → 3926.06] Is that what he's going to do?
[3926.88 → 3927.36] No.
[3928.22 → 3933.28] He's going to provide it one day at a time.
[3934.26 → 3935.42] One day at a time.
[3936.28 → 3938.40] He gives them quail to eat in the evening.
[3938.86 → 3942.12] And he gives them manna to eat in the morning.
[3942.64 → 3944.50] And remember, he does this for how long?
[3946.18 → 3947.62] Forty years.
[3947.62 → 3954.50] Every day, he gives them just what they need for that day.
[3955.50 → 3957.36] So we read in Exodus 16.
[3958.36 → 3960.34] This is what the Lord has commanded.
[3960.88 → 3963.54] Everyone is to gather as much as they need.
[3964.28 → 3966.66] Take an over for each person you have in your tent.
[3967.30 → 3969.32] The Israelites did as they were told.
[3969.82 → 3971.56] Some gathered much and some little.
[3972.14 → 3975.50] Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.
[3975.50 → 3979.84] And then Moses said, no one is to keep any of it until morning.
[3980.62 → 3980.94] Right?
[3981.96 → 3991.50] And all the people being the super obedient people of God, where they say, of course, we wouldn't think to game the system.
[3992.50 → 3995.32] But nevertheless, they didn't do that, did they?
[3995.56 → 3997.48] They tried to gather more than they need.
[3997.54 → 3999.48] They tried to stockpile it in their tents.
[3999.60 → 4000.68] That's just the way we are.
[4002.28 → 4003.46] But God, what did he do?
[4003.46 → 4005.12] He made the food just go bad.
[4005.82 → 4006.30] Immediately.
[4007.38 → 4008.12] It rotted.
[4008.62 → 4012.98] Except for they could gather twice as much before the Sabbath.
[4013.22 → 4014.46] Because you can't work on the Sabbath.
[4016.30 → 4019.80] So here's this beautiful and miraculous thing going on.
[4019.88 → 4021.78] Where God is teaching his people.
[4022.16 → 4023.40] This is training.
[4023.92 → 4025.48] Daily training.
[4026.28 → 4026.90] And instruction.
[4027.18 → 4029.22] That they would be formed as his people.
[4029.56 → 4032.16] By necessity of daily looking to God.
[4032.16 → 4032.94] They're in the wilderness.
[4033.82 → 4035.60] They're not growing crops right now.
[4035.70 → 4037.36] They're heading to the promised land.
[4037.96 → 4040.10] But God will provide every single day.
[4040.42 → 4043.64] He's teaching his people to depend on him for his daily needs.
[4044.32 → 4045.44] For their daily needs.
[4046.14 → 4047.24] Not on themselves.
[4048.54 → 4051.30] God is teaching them, you can't depend on yourselves.
[4051.68 → 4053.04] You need to depend on me.
[4053.90 → 4056.00] And friends, that's what God wants from us as well today.
[4056.90 → 4060.86] It's so easy in our modern Western world to depend on ourselves.
[4060.86 → 4068.88] And God's not saying, you know, you have to go home and haul your refrigerator out and dump it in your yard and unplug it.
[4068.88 → 4071.64] And, you know, we can have pantries.
[4071.78 → 4073.06] We can have refrigerators.
[4073.06 → 4083.54] But what it means is that even if you have a full refrigerator and even if you have a full pantry, that you are depending on God.
[4084.82 → 4085.98] Not on yourselves.
[4086.54 → 4089.16] You are looking to him for everything that we need.
[4089.16 → 4104.20] And one of the things I loved about being a missionary cross-culturally is I felt like one of the Israelites wandering in the wilderness.
[4104.20 → 4107.02] Where you have to depend on God.
[4107.08 → 4109.02] They say, go raise your support.
[4110.20 → 4110.56] Right?
[4112.12 → 4114.86] And, I mean, you just have to pray.
[4115.06 → 4115.82] There's no other way.
[4115.92 → 4116.58] You just pray.
[4116.74 → 4117.40] And you ask.
[4117.48 → 4119.32] But it's God who does the giving.
[4120.14 → 4122.94] And so when we got to Taiwan, we needed a place to stay.
[4123.22 → 4124.66] God provided a house for us.
[4125.36 → 4127.52] He provided it for a couple of years.
[4127.86 → 4129.60] It was a missionary who was on furlough.
[4129.68 → 4131.48] And we could just stay in their house for free.
[4131.48 → 4137.98] And then after that, we needed to move into another apartment after those missionaries came back.
[4138.20 → 4139.46] We didn't have much money.
[4139.66 → 4140.74] We didn't raise a lot of support.
[4141.90 → 4146.52] And so there was a guy in our church that said, I'll rent you my apartment for very cheap.
[4147.12 → 4149.08] So God provided another house.
[4149.96 → 4156.84] And just time after time, when it felt a little bit hard to be dependent on God,
[4156.84 → 4161.92] that's when we notice God constantly providing for all of our needs.
[4163.98 → 4168.10] But, friends, not only do we look to God to provide for our physical needs,
[4168.22 → 4171.56] ultimately, when we pray this prayer, give us today our daily bread,
[4171.86 → 4177.22] it is pointing to the greatest need, the greatest hunger that we all have,
[4177.26 → 4178.42] which is our hunger for God.
[4178.42 → 4183.66] J.C. Ryle is an 18th century Anglican priest, and he once wrote,
[4184.06 → 4188.64] As bread is to the body, so Christ is to the soul.
[4190.32 → 4193.72] And we all know in John 6, Jesus calls himself what?
[4195.10 → 4196.90] The bread of life.
[4198.04 → 4200.80] He says, I am the bread of life.
[4200.80 → 4206.24] So here's what Jesus says, beginning in verse 47, John 6.
[4207.30 → 4209.32] He says, I am the bread of life.
[4209.56 → 4213.28] Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
[4214.44 → 4217.32] But here is the bread, pointing to himself,
[4217.80 → 4222.96] that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.
[4224.58 → 4227.86] I am the living bread that came down from heaven.
[4227.86 → 4230.46] Whoever eats this bread will live forever.
[4230.80 → 4236.56] This bread is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.
[4237.90 → 4241.54] Is it any coincidence that Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem?
[4242.64 → 4244.98] Bet means house.
[4246.06 → 4248.74] Le hem means bread.
[4249.56 → 4252.66] Jesus comes from the house of bread.
[4253.46 → 4255.86] He is the bread of life.
[4255.86 → 4257.82] He is the bread that God has provided,
[4257.82 → 4261.92] the true and greater manna who God has provided for his people,
[4262.00 → 4266.36] that we may feast on him and live eternally.
[4266.58 → 4267.42] Spiritual bread.
[4268.18 → 4269.80] And so when we come to trust in Jesus,
[4269.94 → 4273.58] he promises to satisfy our deepest needs.
[4274.42 → 4276.70] We look, we have this deep hunger,
[4276.70 → 4280.56] and we look to lose so many other things
[4280.56 → 4286.32] that we desire to fulfill this need that we all have in our deepest selves.
[4286.32 → 4293.66] But the only thing that can satisfy that deep need that we all have
[4293.66 → 4296.22] is a restored relationship with God.
[4296.74 → 4298.66] And that's what Jesus provides for us.
[4299.48 → 4303.76] You know, one of the greatest images that Jesus often used for salvation
[4303.76 → 4305.76] is the image of a table.
[4305.76 → 4309.40] A table set.
[4309.54 → 4310.54] Think about Thanksgiving.
[4310.80 → 4311.38] Think about Christmas.
[4311.74 → 4313.18] A table set.
[4314.06 → 4316.74] A seat for every guest at the table.
[4317.18 → 4320.26] A banquet that God has prepared for his people.
[4321.48 → 4324.18] One of Jesus' great parables tells about a king
[4324.18 → 4326.64] who's having a wedding banquet for his son,
[4326.74 → 4328.34] and he wants everyone to be there.
[4329.02 → 4331.76] And this wedding banquet is not exclusive at all.
[4331.76 → 4334.72] He even sends his servants out into the alleyways,
[4335.02 → 4338.90] out into the back ways, the hidden places.
[4339.56 → 4340.40] Invite the poor.
[4340.60 → 4341.30] Invite the lame.
[4341.48 → 4342.24] Invite the needy.
[4342.46 → 4343.96] He wants everyone to come in.
[4345.20 → 4347.04] At this king's table,
[4347.72 → 4353.50] it's a celebration that includes all the wrong kind of people.
[4355.00 → 4359.80] All the people that you wouldn't invite to your feasts.
[4359.80 → 4361.74] But our king invites us.
[4363.74 → 4365.72] And because it is the wrong kind of people,
[4365.84 → 4367.02] do you know who's invited?
[4368.16 → 4369.04] You are.
[4370.22 → 4371.02] And I am.
[4371.90 → 4372.12] Right?
[4372.24 → 4376.12] We are ideally suited to be at this table
[4376.12 → 4378.12] because we have nothing to bring.
[4379.64 → 4380.66] We have nothing.
[4381.14 → 4386.22] We have no status in society that would cause God to invite us.
[4386.22 → 4389.52] We are the people from the alley,
[4390.06 → 4391.32] the poor and the needy.
[4392.04 → 4394.14] And God invites us.
[4395.72 → 4397.48] It's not for those who have it all together,
[4398.04 → 4401.14] but it's for everyone who knows their deep spiritual poverty,
[4401.64 → 4404.66] their need for Jesus to provide the spiritual sustenance
[4404.66 → 4405.74] that we need in himself.
[4407.26 → 4408.94] So friends, when we pray this prayer,
[4409.14 → 4410.56] give us today our daily bread.
[4410.68 → 4411.56] Yes, absolutely.
[4411.56 → 4414.04] We're asking for God to provide for all of our needs.
[4414.80 → 4415.80] But even more so,
[4415.90 → 4418.76] we are asking him to provide for our deepest need,
[4419.60 → 4420.70] our deepest spiritual need,
[4420.78 → 4422.06] through his son Jesus Christ,
[4422.32 → 4423.32] the true bread from heaven.
[4424.20 → 4425.48] Lastly, I just,
[4425.56 → 4426.74] there's two more important things
[4426.74 → 4428.78] I really want to point out from this passage.
[4429.44 → 4431.60] Kind of more, two more practical things.
[4431.66 → 4432.58] When we pray this prayer,
[4432.70 → 4433.62] what are we praying?
[4433.74 → 4434.60] How are we praying it?
[4434.86 → 4436.40] So two last things for us today.
[4436.40 → 4440.04] First, pray for just enough.
[4440.74 → 4441.98] When you pray this prayer,
[4442.06 → 4442.82] how do we pray this?
[4443.76 → 4444.84] Give us our day,
[4445.06 → 4446.42] give us today our daily bread.
[4446.72 → 4447.42] What are we praying?
[4447.56 → 4448.08] How do we pray?
[4448.62 → 4449.66] Pray for just enough.
[4451.02 → 4453.28] Jesus is teaching us to pray
[4453.28 → 4457.04] and ask for only enough.
[4458.48 → 4462.18] Because Jesus knows that a life of self-indulgence
[4462.18 → 4463.74] is dangerous.
[4464.38 → 4465.78] Friends, that's true on many fronts,
[4465.78 → 4467.60] but especially on this one.
[4467.86 → 4469.98] A life of overindulgence
[4469.98 → 4472.12] where we have more than we need,
[4472.56 → 4476.44] it tends to suppress our appetite for God.
[4477.94 → 4479.96] And we see this remarkably
[4479.96 → 4482.66] in Proverbs 30, verses eight to nine.
[4483.34 → 4484.60] This is what it says.
[4487.24 → 4488.06] Give me,
[4488.22 → 4489.10] so this is kind of a prayer,
[4489.48 → 4491.88] give me neither poverty nor riches,
[4492.42 → 4494.36] but give me only my daily bread.
[4494.36 → 4496.84] Otherwise, I may have too much
[4496.84 → 4497.68] and disown you
[4497.68 → 4498.74] and say,
[4498.96 → 4499.66] who is the Lord?
[4500.56 → 4502.32] Or I may become poor and steal
[4502.32 → 4504.46] and so dishonour the name of my God.
[4506.58 → 4507.44] Just enough.
[4508.00 → 4509.16] Give us today our daily bread
[4509.16 → 4511.90] is a prayer to reorient our desires.
[4512.44 → 4513.60] And so we are content
[4513.60 → 4515.56] just with our daily needs.
[4516.14 → 4517.56] The second thing we need to say
[4517.56 → 4518.78] about how to pray this petition
[4518.78 → 4521.58] is to notice the language of our,
[4521.70 → 4523.34] our daily bread.
[4523.94 → 4525.78] We don't pray for my daily bread.
[4525.90 → 4529.06] We don't even pray for my family's daily bread.
[4529.24 → 4531.26] We pray for our daily bread.
[4532.24 → 4533.24] And so when we pray this,
[4533.32 → 4535.76] one of the things that ought to register with us
[4535.76 → 4538.62] is that there are many people around the world
[4538.62 → 4540.24] who actually don't have their daily bread,
[4540.30 → 4540.56] do they?
[4541.56 → 4542.90] They don't have it today.
[4542.90 → 4544.88] Maybe there's a chance
[4544.88 → 4545.96] they may not have it tomorrow.
[4547.54 → 4548.54] And so in this prayer,
[4548.64 → 4549.62] we're praying not only
[4549.62 → 4551.70] that God would provide for our needs,
[4552.12 → 4553.88] but we're also praying for the poor.
[4554.40 → 4556.24] We're praying for the needy and the vulnerable.
[4556.38 → 4557.92] It's a prayer for the world.
[4558.90 → 4561.22] One Latin American pastor says it this way.
[4562.82 → 4563.12] He says,
[4563.26 → 4565.22] Oh God, to those who hunger,
[4565.70 → 4566.20] give bread.
[4566.84 → 4568.06] To those who have bread,
[4568.84 → 4570.14] give them a hunger for justice.
[4570.14 → 4573.78] This prayer teaches Christians
[4573.78 → 4575.44] to pray on behalf of the world.
[4576.50 → 4579.20] Because when you become a follower of Jesus,
[4580.02 → 4581.40] suddenly what happens
[4581.40 → 4584.54] is that wherever you see a lack
[4584.54 → 4587.36] of God's kingdom reign in the world,
[4588.02 → 4589.14] you find that troubling.
[4590.28 → 4590.50] Right?
[4590.56 → 4591.58] You find that disturbing.
[4593.14 → 4594.22] And so we ask for the spirit
[4594.22 → 4595.36] to give us a hunger
[4595.36 → 4597.16] for God's kingdom to reign
[4597.16 → 4598.56] in every place
[4598.56 → 4600.16] in this world
[4600.16 → 4601.64] where his reign
[4601.64 → 4602.66] is not yet coming.
[4602.76 → 4603.66] And that is definitely
[4603.66 → 4604.64] including of the hungry.
[4606.06 → 4606.96] So when we pray,
[4607.08 → 4608.20] give us today our dilly bread,
[4608.30 → 4609.70] we ask God also
[4609.70 → 4611.48] that we can be part
[4611.48 → 4612.52] of God's answer
[4612.52 → 4613.44] to that prayer.
[4614.20 → 4615.76] Let me pray that God would help us.
[4619.50 → 4620.62] Father, we thank you
[4620.62 → 4622.02] that we can bring
[4622.02 → 4624.30] all of our needs to you.
[4624.38 → 4625.98] And we bring so many desires.
[4626.18 → 4626.92] We don't know,
[4626.92 → 4628.52] are these the right desires
[4628.52 → 4629.40] to bring to you?
[4630.52 → 4631.48] But Lord, we trust you
[4631.48 → 4632.66] to sort out our desires.
[4633.50 → 4634.72] You will only give us
[4634.72 → 4636.26] what is right for us.
[4637.52 → 4638.10] And Lord,
[4638.16 → 4639.80] in all that you do give to us,
[4639.90 → 4641.42] help us to lift
[4641.42 → 4643.66] our heads and our eyes
[4643.66 → 4645.28] to thank you
[4645.28 → 4645.94] and gratitude
[4645.94 → 4647.14] for what you give.
[4648.58 → 4649.16] And Lord,
[4649.24 → 4650.58] help us to receive
[4650.58 → 4651.92] all that you give us,
[4652.54 → 4654.24] not as just for ourselves,
[4654.38 → 4655.32] but for the world.
[4655.32 → 4656.80] Help us to steward well
[4656.80 → 4657.86] all that you give us.
[4658.60 → 4659.94] Lord, help us by your spirit.
[4660.34 → 4661.88] Be a people who pray this prayer.
[4662.58 → 4663.70] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4664.38 → 4664.66] Amen.
[4666.74 → 4668.50] So I invite you now to stand
[4668.50 → 4670.58] and we will sing
[4670.58 → 4672.10] Psalm 23.
[4672.10 → 4672.16] Psalm 23.
[4672.16 → 4672.24] Psalm 23.
[4672.24 → 4674.10] Psalm 23.
[4674.10 → 4676.10] Psalm 23.
[4676.10 → 4680.10] Psalm 23.
[4680.10 → 4682.10] Psalm 23.
[4682.10 → 4683.10] Psalm 23.
[4683.10 → 4684.10] Psalm 23.
[4684.10 → 4685.10] Psalm 23.
[4685.10 → 4686.92] Plenty під
[4686.92 → 4690.42] Psalm 23.
[4690.48 → 4691.72] Psalm 23.
[4691.72 → 4692.72] Psalm 23.
[4692.72 → 4693.96] Your flesh ever
[4693.96 → 4699.52] a la
[4700.44 → 4700.84] ease he makes me lie
[4700.84 → 4702.44] in pasture
[4702.44 → 4703.02] screen.
[4704.10 → 4705.88] Leads me by
[4708.00 → 4709.12] the still, still
[4709.12 → 4710.36] waters.
[4710.36 → 4712.98] His goodness
[4712.98 → 4716.82] Restores my soul
[4716.82 → 4723.02] And I will trust in Him alone
[4723.02 → 4729.74] And I will trust in You alone
[4729.74 → 4737.46] For Your endless mercy follows me
[4737.46 → 4742.64] Your goodness will lead me home
[4742.64 → 4748.66] He guides my ways in righteousness
[4748.66 → 4756.40] And He unlocks my head with love
[4756.40 → 4764.28] And my God when overflows with joy
[4764.28 → 4770.14] I feast on His pure delights
[4770.14 → 4775.86] And I will trust in You alone
[4775.86 → 4782.16] And I will trust in You alone
[4782.16 → 4790.50] For Your endless mercy follows me
[4790.50 → 4796.22] Your goodness will lead me home
[4796.22 → 4802.22] And though I walk in the darkest path
[4802.22 → 4809.40] I will not fear the evil one
[4809.40 → 4816.22] For You were with me, and You're on inside
[4816.22 → 4822.22] I will trust in You alone
[4822.22 → 4828.22] And I will trust in You alone
[4828.22 → 4835.22] And I will trust in You alone
[4835.22 → 4842.94] For Your endless mercy follows me
[4842.94 → 4848.88] Your goodness will lead me home
[4848.88 → 4860.90] So I announced that as I announced at the beginning of the service
[4860.90 → 4864.90] We will now be collecting our offering
[4864.90 → 4869.60] In the course of our worship service right now
[4869.60 → 4874.88] James 1.17 tells us that every good and perfect gift is from above
[4874.88 → 4877.88] Coming down from the Father of the Heavenly Lights
[4877.88 → 4881.64] So as everything we have comes from God
[4881.64 → 4886.10] We now will worship Him also by bringing our tithes and our offerings to the Lord
[4886.10 → 4894.46] Our designated offering this Sunday is for M2W2 Restorative Christian Ministries
[4894.46 → 4899.66] Their ministry whose mission is to empower and equip volunteers
[4899.66 → 4905.20] To build mentoring relationships with people who are affected by incarceration
[4905.20 → 4912.06] And so if you are wanting to give by cash or check
[4912.06 → 4915.30] I think the deacons will be passing around the bag right now
[4915.30 → 4918.66] And if you can still give online as well though
[4918.66 → 4925.66] Thank you
[4925.66 → 4927.66] Thank you
[4927.66 → 4929.66] Thank you
[4929.66 → 4931.66] Thank you
[4931.66 → 4944.66] Thank you
[4944.66 → 4946.66] Amen.
[4974.66 → 4976.66] Amen.
[5004.66 → 5006.66] Amen.
[5011.66 → 5013.66] Let's join our hearts in prayer together.
[5015.18 → 5021.50] Lord Jesus, thank you that though we are sinners, you were the one crucified.
[5023.20 → 5031.36] Thank you that you shared in our humanity so that by your death you might break the power of him who holds the power of death, that is the devil,
[5031.36 → 5038.50] and free us, all who our whole lives were held in slavery by our fear of death.
[5039.90 → 5049.48] Thank you that you have given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[5050.20 → 5055.94] Even though now for a little while we may have had to suffer a little grief in all kinds of trials,
[5055.94 → 5061.18] fill us with an inexpressible and a glorious joy.
[5062.44 → 5071.76] Work through us in these gifts for the building up of your kingdom that all glory may redound to you, Lord Jesus.
[5072.62 → 5076.92] We pray, especially this morning, for M2W2, their work with prisoners.
[5078.26 → 5080.78] Lord, would your kingdom come to prisons.
[5080.78 → 5088.08] Those, Lord, who we pray that you would give prisoners all that they need.
[5088.76 → 5092.14] And Lord, also a deep spiritual hunger to know the Lord Jesus.
[5093.70 → 5098.26] And Lord, we also pray now for the many needs of our church.
[5098.34 → 5102.12] And Lord, we have so many needs that we can bring before you.
[5102.86 → 5106.96] But this morning, Lord, we pray for the need we all have for health.
[5106.96 → 5113.72] Lord, we pray for all of those who still suffer, especially from cancer.
[5113.84 → 5115.76] We think of Joan and Doug, Lord.
[5116.34 → 5118.78] We pray for your healing hands upon them.
[5119.20 → 5125.50] For others who suffer each day, Lord, would you be their strength in everything that they need.
[5126.52 → 5133.16] Lord, for each one of us also, would you help us to be content with all that you give us.
[5133.16 → 5138.38] And also to learn how to ask for you for all that we need for ourselves and for others.
[5139.50 → 5145.24] Finally, Lord, we give you great praise for the birth of a new little boy to Jason and Michaela.
[5145.86 → 5150.10] We thank you, Lord, that everyone in their family is healthy.
[5150.78 → 5154.70] We pray, Lord, for a good recovery for Michaela.
[5155.24 → 5161.78] And that you would bless their family, Lord, as they welcome this new little boy into their life.
[5161.78 → 5168.70] And we thank you for a new life that is coming into our church, not only spiritually, but also physically.
[5170.26 → 5174.90] Lord, all of these things we ask and pray to you, who is our Heavenly Father.
[5175.54 → 5177.52] We pray through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[5178.04 → 5178.44] Amen.
[5179.64 → 5185.50] Would you please stand with me and receive these words of blessing?
