[18.68 --> 24.52]  doom
[24.52 --> 54.50]  Thank you.
[54.52 --> 84.50]  Thank you.
[84.52 --> 114.50]  Thank you.
[114.52 --> 144.50]  Thank you.
[144.52 --> 174.50]  Thank you.
[174.52 --> 204.50]  Thank you.
[204.52 --> 234.50]  Thank you.
[234.52 --> 264.50]  Thank you.
[264.52 --> 294.50]  Thank you.
[294.52 --> 324.50]  Thank you.
[325.50 --> 326.70]  Good morning, everyone.
[328.14 --> 330.70]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[330.90 --> 338.12]  We are excited to gather together today, both to offer our worship to God for who he is,
[338.62 --> 343.76]  as well as to receive from him what we need in our daily lives.
[343.76 --> 351.38]  I want to extend a warm welcome to you, we are here with us, and we love to get to know you,
[351.38 --> 353.52]  welcome you to our congregation.
[354.18 --> 358.36]  So today is our, what we call, Family Worship Sunday.
[358.36 --> 363.28]  And so we have our Chinese, a lot of our Chinese brothers and sisters here with us today.
[363.28 --> 375.46]  And that's why you will see you will see you, and we'll see you, and we'll see you next week,
[375.46 --> 375.58]  and we'll see you next week.
[375.58 --> 380.34]  And on Family Worship Sundays, we also will be celebrating the Lord's Supper together, and
[380.34 --> 385.74]  we will have a children's message. So for you kids here, I look forward to talking with you a bit.
[385.74 --> 391.38]  So there are a few announcements. If you have a bulletin, you can find them in here.
[391.96 --> 396.64]  One is today, right after the service, we will have our soup and buns lunch.
[397.02 --> 400.18]  So that is right through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[400.18 --> 405.52]  We have many pots of soup, sandwiches. Everyone is welcome to stay for lunch.
[407.06 --> 413.24]  Also, we have a membership class that will be starting up soon. So I did have to postpone it
[413.24 --> 420.78]  a week. So you can see the new dates there in the bulletin. But a membership class, this is for
[420.78 --> 426.96]  anyone who first just wants to learn more about our church. You know, we'll talk about who we are.
[426.96 --> 432.18]  We will talk about what we believe in our ministries. So it's a great way to learn about the church if
[432.18 --> 439.90]  you're new. But also, it's required if you want to profess faith and become a member of the church.
[440.54 --> 445.54]  And so if you are not yet a member of the church, maybe you've even been coming for quite a while,
[445.66 --> 449.78]  I do want to encourage you to consider to become a member. And if you want to just learn more about
[449.78 --> 455.28]  what that means, you can also sign up for the class. So there's a sign-up sheet. I encourage you to
[455.28 --> 464.52]  sign up for that. Also, we are getting ready for Christmas. It's still a bit away, but we have
[464.52 --> 472.46]  what we're doing is on Christmas Eve, we are going to have a Christmas choir. So I'm excited about this.
[472.54 --> 479.60]  We're going to start a choir. Paul Kemp will be leading us. And it is open to all ages and,
[479.60 --> 485.86]  as I understand it, all ability. So even I can join. So I'm going to join the choir. There's a sign-up
[485.86 --> 494.30]  sheet. And we will rehearse Sunday after our worship services beginning on November 27th. So just stay,
[494.40 --> 500.80]  we'll just rehearse a song, and then we'll sing together on Christmas Eve. That'll be great.
[500.80 --> 513.92]  Okay, so with that, let's turn our attention to God. We are here to lift our eyes beyond just what we
[513.92 --> 520.84]  can physically see and touch. We're here to lift our eyes and our hearts up to the one who reigns over
[520.84 --> 528.16]  all things in heaven and on earth. So let's respond to God's invitation to us to lift our eyes up to him.
[528.16 --> 533.28]  He welcomes us into his presence with this call to worship from Isaiah 52.
[535.12 --> 542.52]  How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace,
[542.90 --> 554.46]  who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, your God reigns. Burst into songs of
[554.46 --> 563.54]  joy together. For the Lord has comforted his people. He has redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord will lay bare his
[563.54 --> 572.32]  holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
[572.96 --> 578.18]  Let's bow before this redeeming, this saving God in a moment of prayer. Please pray with me.
[578.18 --> 586.18]  Father, we come before you this morning, and we acknowledge that you are God, and we are not.
[586.94 --> 594.80]  We are yours. We are the works of your hands, and you are the God who reigns over all the ends of the earth.
[595.66 --> 599.10]  And so we come to you today. We ask that you would reign in this world.
[599.10 --> 604.96]  We ask that you would reign in our church, that you would reign in our lives.
[605.92 --> 608.84]  Help us to lift our eyes and our hearts to you today.
[609.92 --> 617.54]  Remind us of who you are, how great you are, and how you can meet every need that we have.
[617.54 --> 625.04]  For these reasons, we come before you this morning, and we give you this time in worship.
[625.72 --> 630.32]  In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, we pray. Amen.
[631.32 --> 637.32]  So friends, please rise in body or in spirit as you are able for this greeting from Isaiah 52.
[637.32 --> 646.46]  Awake, awake, Zion. Clothe yourself with strength, for the Lord will go before you.
[647.18 --> 649.92]  The God of Israel will be your rear guard.
[650.54 --> 654.76]  So as the Lord has greeted us, I want to invite you to turn, greet those around you,
[654.82 --> 659.76]  especially if you see someone you haven't seen in a while, you haven't met before, please greet them.
[659.76 --> 689.74]  Thank you.
[689.76 --> 704.26]  As we worship together, it's our individual worship that is knit together to make corporate worship.
[704.50 --> 711.00]  And so this first song just explains our posture that I hope we can all embrace today,
[711.16 --> 717.36]  that here we are personally, here I am to worship, to bow down, to say that you are my God.
[717.36 --> 719.54]  Let's sing this together.
[719.76 --> 730.26]  Together.
[730.26 --> 737.02]  Light of the world, you step down into darkness.
[737.42 --> 741.92]  Open my eyes, let me see.
[741.92 --> 748.42]  Beauty that made this heart adore you.
[748.42 --> 752.42]  Hope of all life spent with you.
[752.42 --> 766.42]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[766.42 --> 778.42]  You're all together lovely, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[778.42 --> 779.42]  King of all day, all together wonderful to me.
[779.42 --> 788.42]  King of all days, oh so highly exalted.
[788.42 --> 789.42]  Glorious in heaven above.
[789.42 --> 793.42]  Glorious in heaven above.
[793.42 --> 798.92]  Humbly you came to the earth you created.
[798.92 --> 803.92]  All for love's sake, all for love's sake became poor.
[803.92 --> 805.92]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[805.92 --> 817.92]  Here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[817.92 --> 829.92]  You're all together lovely, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[829.92 --> 840.92]  I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.
[840.92 --> 851.92]  I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.
[851.92 --> 874.92]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[874.92 --> 887.92]  You're all together lovely, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me.
[887.92 --> 892.92]  Opalion is my pastor of Pine egvern he Eisenberg.
[892.92 --> 898.92]  There you go.
[898.92 --> 903.92]  I was above plan, my parents who踏 bonly shall ט siацию dcticamenteト learn.
[903.92 --> 909.92]  Our journey came to the mountains above.
[909.92 --> 916.92]  You should st Meet this person on thesal구요 in the mountains above.
[916.92 --> 931.66]  He became a man who knew no sin
[931.66 --> 935.92]  That we might become his righteousness
[935.92 --> 942.82]  He humbled himself and carried the cross
[942.82 --> 950.80]  Love so amazing, love so amazing
[950.80 --> 961.82]  Jesus Messiah, name above all names
[962.34 --> 968.70]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
[968.70 --> 974.68]  The rescue for sinners
[974.68 --> 979.68]  The ransom from heaven
[979.68 --> 988.68]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[988.68 --> 996.76]  His body the bread, His blood the wine
[996.76 --> 1001.66]  Broken and poured out all for love
[1001.66 --> 1006.66]  The whole earth trembled, the pit was torn
[1006.66 --> 1014.64]  Love so amazing, love so amazing
[1014.64 --> 1017.64]  Love so amazing, love so amazing
[1017.64 --> 1026.64]  Jesus Messiah, name above all names
[1026.64 --> 1032.62]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
[1032.62 --> 1042.60]  Ransom from heaven
[1042.60 --> 1049.60]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[1049.60 --> 1055.58]  Lord of all

[1063.56 --> 1069.56]  All the glory to you, Lord
[1069.56 --> 1074.56]  The light of the world
[1074.56 --> 1084.54]  Jesus Messiah, name above all names
[1084.54 --> 1090.52]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
[1090.52 --> 1096.50]  The rescue for sinners
[1096.50 --> 1098.50]  The rescue for sinners
[1098.50 --> 1101.50]  The ransom from heaven
[1101.50 --> 1111.50]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[1111.50 --> 1141.48]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[1141.50 --> 1143.38]  And we are Ne Lexington
[1143.52 --> 1145.46]  Jesus Messiah, Lord of all
[1145.46 --> 1146.46]  Lord of all
[1146.46 --> 1151.46]  Jesus Messiah.
[1151.46 --> 1177.34]  You are my strength when I am weak.
[1177.34 --> 1180.66]  You are the treasure that I seek.
[1180.66 --> 1185.66]  You are my all in all.
[1187.26 --> 1190.54]  Seeking you as a precious true,
[1190.98 --> 1193.78]  Oh, to give up I'd be a fool.
[1194.20 --> 1197.66]  You are my all in all.
[1200.66 --> 1205.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1205.96 --> 1210.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1212.96 --> 1217.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1217.96 --> 1222.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1222.96 --> 1229.20]  Taking my sin, my cross, my shame,
[1229.20 --> 1232.52]  Rising again, I bless your name.
[1232.52 --> 1236.96]  You are my all in all.
[1236.96 --> 1241.96]  When I fall down, you pick me up.
[1241.96 --> 1244.96]  When I am dry, you fill my cup.
[1244.96 --> 1248.96]  You are my all in all.
[1248.96 --> 1256.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1256.96 --> 1260.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1260.96 --> 1269.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1269.96 --> 1273.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1273.96 --> 1274.96]  And that chorus again.
[1274.96 --> 1275.96]  And that chorus again.
[1275.96 --> 1282.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1282.96 --> 1288.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1288.96 --> 1291.96]  Jesus, Lamb of God,
[1291.96 --> 1301.96]  Worthy is your name.
[1301.96 --> 1303.96]  Amen.
[1303.96 --> 1318.96]  I worship the Lord with a time of repentance and renewal.
[1318.96 --> 1326.98]  Sometimes in the scriptures, we read about who God is, how he calls us to live in this world for him.
[1327.98 --> 1339.20]  And that leads us to confession, where we realize that we fall short of what God requires and we fail to live up all that he asks us in his love.
[1339.50 --> 1345.18]  But other times, the Bible actually just names our sin.
[1345.86 --> 1348.72]  It tells us just how we have sinned against God.
[1348.96 --> 1359.74]  And so when we read passages like that, which we will read in a moment from Isaiah 59, we must listen to what God says.
[1360.42 --> 1364.44]  Because God does require something of us.
[1365.20 --> 1367.54]  And that something is repentance.
[1369.18 --> 1375.86]  So yes, God's love is offered to us free of cost in that Jesus paid it all.
[1375.86 --> 1381.84]  But no, it is not just automatically applied or automatically received.
[1382.10 --> 1384.12]  We must take hold of it.
[1384.78 --> 1394.78]  And we do so by turning away from our sin, by acknowledging our sin and accepting that God alone can rescue us.
[1395.26 --> 1400.40]  So with that in mind, let us remember what God says to us, his people.
[1400.40 --> 1409.16]  For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us.
[1409.96 --> 1416.40]  Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities together.
[1416.40 --> 1420.30]  Rebellion and treachery against the Lord.
[1420.30 --> 1423.26]  Turning our backs on our God.
[1423.94 --> 1426.20]  Inciting revolt and oppression.
[1427.04 --> 1430.34]  Uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
[1431.18 --> 1433.40]  So justice is driven back.
[1434.22 --> 1436.90]  And righteousness stands at a distance.
[1437.76 --> 1439.56]  Truth has stumbled in the streets.
[1439.56 --> 1442.56]  Honesty cannot enter.
[1443.68 --> 1446.82]  Would you bow in prayer with me in a prayer of confession.
[1449.04 --> 1455.68]  Heavenly Father, we come before you humbly, acknowledging our sin before you.
[1456.24 --> 1461.88]  For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sin testifies against us.
[1461.88 --> 1468.16]  Lord, you alone are the God who saves.
[1469.00 --> 1476.20]  By your grace, we ask that you would forgive us, renew us, and change us.
[1476.90 --> 1480.74]  We thank you that you are ever pursuing us in your love.
[1481.68 --> 1487.70]  We thank you that even despite our sin, your love never falters.
[1487.70 --> 1489.56]  It never ceases.
[1490.36 --> 1496.32]  Even in the moments when you are displeased with our sin, you still love us.
[1497.24 --> 1502.58]  And for those of us who belong to you, who are in a covenant relationship with you through Jesus Christ,
[1502.78 --> 1506.18]  there is nothing that can remove your love and your mercy from us.
[1507.36 --> 1510.68]  Your love never changes, and that is good news.
[1510.68 --> 1516.78]  Because it means there will never come a day when your forgiveness is no longer available to us.
[1517.80 --> 1524.02]  So Lord, we look to you in your grace freely given to us through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1524.60 --> 1526.16]  We pray in his name.
[1526.90 --> 1527.26]  Amen.
[1528.74 --> 1535.82]  Brothers and sisters, please rise and hear the promise of God to all who look to Christ for mercy.
[1535.82 --> 1546.16]  In all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[1547.02 --> 1557.54]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[1557.54 --> 1562.56]  neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
[1562.56 --> 1570.02]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1570.46 --> 1574.04]  Let's remain standing and let's sing a song of renewal together.
[1574.04 --> 1604.02]  Let's sing a song of renewal together.
[1604.04 --> 1634.02]  Let's sing a song of renewal together.
[1634.02 --> 1636.02]  Amazing love.
[1636.02 --> 1637.02]  Amazing love.
[1637.02 --> 1638.02]  Amazing love.
[1638.02 --> 1639.02]  How can it be?
[1639.02 --> 1644.02]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1644.02 --> 1649.02]  Amazing love.
[1649.02 --> 1653.02]  How can it be?
[1653.02 --> 1662.02]  Amazing love.
[1662.02 --> 1664.02]  Amazing love.
[1664.02 --> 1675.02]  Is my joy to honor you.
[1675.02 --> 1680.02]  I do, I honor you.
[1681.88 --> 1687.02]  You are my king.
[1688.78 --> 1694.02]  You are my king.
[1695.92 --> 1701.02]  Jesus, you are my king.
[1701.02 --> 1709.46]  Jesus, you are my king.
[1711.02 --> 1716.02]  Amazing love, how can he?
[1718.18 --> 1722.02]  You might be, but I will be.
[1724.02 --> 1730.02]  Amazing love, I know this is true.
[1731.02 --> 1735.36]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1736.78 --> 1742.70]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1743.76 --> 1750.62]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1750.62 --> 1761.92]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1761.92 --> 1762.30]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1762.30 --> 1762.86]  Amen.
[1770.86 --> 1779.22]  So, brothers and sisters, we come now to the table of the Lord Jesus.
[1779.22 --> 1790.24]  He invites all those who have been baptized, who trust in him as their savior, to eat with him, dine with him at this table.
[1791.16 --> 1798.70]  So those of you who name his name, those of you who belong to him, this is your rightful inheritance.
[1799.46 --> 1803.80]  To strengthen you, to seek after him, and to follow him.
[1803.80 --> 1809.32]  And so today I want to use a bit of a different liturgy than we often do.
[1809.52 --> 1813.22]  It's more following the traditional Great Thanksgiving, it's called.
[1813.80 --> 1815.88]  So please follow along on the screen.
[1819.12 --> 1820.50]  Lift up your hearts.
[1821.08 --> 1823.16]  We lift them up to the Lord.
[1823.88 --> 1826.12]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[1826.76 --> 1830.24]  It is right for us to give thanks and praise.
[1830.24 --> 1842.60]  With joy we praise you, gracious Father, for you have created heaven and earth, made us in your image, and kept covenant with us, even when we fell into sin.
[1843.26 --> 1853.28]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, our Lord, who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to us the way of everlasting life.
[1853.28 --> 1863.46]  Therefore, we join our voices with all the saints and angels and the whole creation to proclaim the glory of your name together.
[1864.24 --> 1872.62]  Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory.
[1873.22 --> 1877.06]  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[1877.06 --> 1882.80]  The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1883.56 --> 1888.50]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you.
[1889.26 --> 1891.92]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1892.70 --> 1898.36]  The same way he took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is a new covenant in my blood.
[1898.86 --> 1903.22]  As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1903.22 --> 1911.36]  For as often as we eat this bread and drink the cup, we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[1911.92 --> 1914.64]  Therefore, together we proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1915.64 --> 1916.70]  Christ has died.
[1917.26 --> 1918.24]  Christ is risen.
[1919.00 --> 1920.44]  Christ will come again.
[1920.86 --> 1921.34]  Let's pray.
[1922.48 --> 1932.34]  Lord, our God, we ask that you would send your Holy Spirit so that this bread and cup may be for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1932.34 --> 1943.88]  By your spirit, make us one with Christ, that we may be one with all these brothers and sisters who share this feast.
[1944.72 --> 1950.84]  All honor and glory is yours, Heavenly Father, now and forever.
[1951.74 --> 1952.20]  Amen.
[1953.42 --> 1958.82]  May I ask the elders now to come forward and help me serve the elements.
[1958.82 --> 1959.02]  Amen.
[1962.34 --> 1964.34]  Amen.
[1964.34 --> 1965.84]  Amen.
[1973.78 --> 1974.46]  Amen.
[1974.46 --> 1975.44]  Amen.
[1976.28 --> 1977.16]  Amen.
[1977.16 --> 1980.16]  Amen.
[1980.30 --> 1980.96]  Amen.
[1980.96 --> 1984.26]  Amen.
[1984.26 --> 1984.82]  Amen.
[1988.60 --> 1988.94]  Amen.
[1988.94 --> 1989.24]  Amen.
[1989.24 --> 1990.00]  Amen.
[1990.00 --> 1990.30]  Amen.
[1990.30 --> 1992.30]  Amen.
[2020.30 --> 2022.30]  Amen.
[2050.30 --> 2052.30]  Amen.
[2080.30 --> 2082.30]  Amen.
[2110.30 --> 2112.30]  Amen.
[2140.30 --> 2142.30]  Amen.
[2170.30 --> 2179.28]  Brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember and believe that the body of Christ is the bread of heaven for us.
[2179.44 --> 2180.02]  Let's eat together.
[2200.30 --> 2202.30]  Amen.
[2230.30 --> 2232.30]  Amen.
[2260.30 --> 2262.30]  Amen.
[2290.30 --> 2292.30]  Amen.
[2320.30 --> 2322.30]  Amen.
[2350.30 --> 2352.30]  Amen.
[2380.30 --> 2381.30]  Amen.
[2381.30 --> 2382.30]  Amen.
[2382.30 --> 2383.30]  Amen.
[2384.30 --> 2385.30]  Amen.
[2385.30 --> 2386.30]  Amen.
[2387.30 --> 2388.30]  Amen.
[2388.30 --> 2389.30]  Amen.
[2389.30 --> 2395.12]  Brothers and sisters, take, drink, remember and believe that the blood of Christ is the cup of our salvation.
[2395.12 --> 2396.12]  Let's drink together.
[2396.12 --> 2397.12]  Amen.
[2397.12 --> 2398.58]  Please join me in a prayer.
[2398.58 --> 2410.12]  Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have welcomed us, seated us here today.
[2410.12 --> 2413.48]  seated us, and fed us at this table.
[2414.32 --> 2416.82]  Send us out now in the power of your Spirit
[2416.82 --> 2419.80]  to live and work to your praise and glory
[2419.80 --> 2422.18]  for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2422.74 --> 2423.12]  Amen.
[2432.80 --> 2435.40]  So it is now time for our children's message.
[2435.40 --> 2439.12]  I want to invite the kids to come on down
[2439.12 --> 2440.42]  and sit with me up front,
[2440.52 --> 2441.94]  and I have something to show you.
[2448.60 --> 2449.28]  Right up here.
[2467.06 --> 2468.12]  Did you take my Bible?
[2469.12 --> 2469.96]  Is that the one?
[2470.26 --> 2470.54]  Okay.
[2479.12 --> 2479.92]  Is that the one?
[2480.92 --> 2481.60]  Oh, yeah.
[2481.96 --> 2482.26]  Okay.
[2482.54 --> 2483.16]  That's the one.
[2484.54 --> 2485.02]  Okay.
[2485.26 --> 2485.92]  I found my Bible.
[2486.22 --> 2486.44]  Good.
[2488.16 --> 2488.66]  All right.
[2488.70 --> 2489.26]  Have a seat.
[2489.26 --> 2496.94]  Come on up.
[2496.98 --> 2497.54]  Have a seat.
[2497.54 --> 2497.60]  All right.
[2500.94 --> 2502.88]  So, hello, everyone.
[2503.88 --> 2504.32]  Hello.
[2504.78 --> 2505.40]  How are you today?
[2506.04 --> 2506.56]  You're good?
[2506.76 --> 2507.36]  Is everyone good?
[2507.90 --> 2508.34]  Yeah.
[2508.46 --> 2509.54]  It's a beautiful day, right?
[2510.14 --> 2511.16]  I have.
[2512.16 --> 2513.42]  So, let me ask you a question.
[2513.78 --> 2516.36]  Who has ever planted a seed before?
[2516.78 --> 2518.46]  Have you ever planted a seed in the ground
[2518.46 --> 2520.80]  or maybe in a pot at home?
[2521.30 --> 2523.42]  Maybe you have a garden at home, maybe?
[2523.56 --> 2523.70]  Right?
[2524.44 --> 2528.70]  Well, they have a flower?
[2529.70 --> 2530.38]  What do you have?
[2530.84 --> 2532.80]  I have a flower at school.
[2533.02 --> 2534.14]  You've grown a flower at school.
[2534.26 --> 2534.46]  Yeah.
[2534.56 --> 2535.90]  You can do it at school, too.
[2536.38 --> 2536.82]  Awesome.
[2537.24 --> 2537.62]  Yeah, you?
[2537.62 --> 2538.34]  I love it.
[2538.34 --> 2538.46]  I love it.
[2538.46 --> 2538.76]  I love it.
[2538.76 --> 2539.90]  I love it.
[2539.90 --> 2540.10]  I love it.
[2540.10 --> 2540.28]  I love it.
[2540.94 --> 2541.68]  Grow fruit.
[2541.74 --> 2542.08]  Fruit?
[2542.46 --> 2542.80]  Fruit?
[2542.88 --> 2543.02]  Yeah?
[2543.38 --> 2543.68]  Awesome.
[2543.84 --> 2544.04]  Okay.
[2544.18 --> 2545.72]  So, I have a seed for you.
[2547.02 --> 2548.44]  Everyone can have one, okay?
[2549.02 --> 2550.32]  So, this will just take a moment.
[2551.84 --> 2552.20]  Okay.
[2552.38 --> 2552.86]  So, here.
[2554.14 --> 2555.18]  Would you like to take a seed?
[2556.30 --> 2558.00]  I would say take one and pass it on,
[2558.08 --> 2559.94]  but we'd have seeds everywhere.
[2561.14 --> 2562.32]  Not that I'm going to do much better.
[2562.54 --> 2563.06]  Let's see.
[2563.20 --> 2563.40]  Okay.
[2563.94 --> 2564.18]  Yeah.
[2565.18 --> 2565.72]  There you go.
[2565.72 --> 2566.60]  Yeah, just take one.
[2566.78 --> 2567.42]  Take one seed.
[2568.12 --> 2568.90]  Would you like one?
[2569.70 --> 2570.48]  Would you like a seed?
[2570.48 --> 2573.90]  You can do it.
[2574.04 --> 2574.18]  Yep.
[2574.54 --> 2575.06]  All right.
[2575.22 --> 2575.52]  Good.
[2575.98 --> 2576.26]  All right.
[2576.30 --> 2576.90]  Hold on to it.
[2577.14 --> 2577.74]  Hold on to it.
[2577.78 --> 2578.78]  Keep it in your hand, okay?
[2579.78 --> 2580.26]  All right.
[2583.90 --> 2584.22]  Okay.
[2584.32 --> 2585.08]  I'm going to come over here.
[2586.00 --> 2586.58]  There we go.
[2587.70 --> 2588.60]  Take a seed.
[2594.18 --> 2594.56]  All right.
[2594.60 --> 2595.06]  You have a seed?
[2596.66 --> 2596.92]  Yeah.
[2597.60 --> 2597.82]  Yeah.
[2597.86 --> 2598.22]  So, just.
[2598.64 --> 2598.78]  Yeah.
[2598.82 --> 2599.58]  You just need one.
[2599.74 --> 2599.86]  All right.
[2599.90 --> 2600.26]  Take one.
[2601.04 --> 2601.76]  Would you like one?
[2604.16 --> 2605.34]  You can take one for your brother.
[2605.50 --> 2606.26]  That's very nice of you.
[2607.14 --> 2607.74]  Oh, okay.
[2609.60 --> 2610.18]  Here you go.
[2612.74 --> 2613.10]  Okay.
[2613.26 --> 2613.80]  Got it.
[2613.86 --> 2614.22]  All right.
[2614.36 --> 2615.34]  Who else needs a seed?
[2615.62 --> 2616.26]  Here you go.
[2618.56 --> 2619.72]  That's the tiniest one.
[2620.02 --> 2620.30]  Okay.
[2620.98 --> 2621.70]  Here you go.
[2624.48 --> 2624.84]  Okay.
[2625.08 --> 2626.00]  Does everyone have a seed?
[2626.72 --> 2627.08]  Okay.
[2627.08 --> 2627.48]  Good.
[2627.90 --> 2630.46]  Who knows what kind of seed this is without looking at my container?
[2630.46 --> 2632.76]  What do you want me to do with these?
[2637.98 --> 2638.94]  Not a flower seed.
[2639.98 --> 2640.22]  Not a flower seed.
[2640.22 --> 2640.50]  Not?
[2640.64 --> 2641.14]  It's not.
[2641.24 --> 2643.56]  Well, it is a type of plant.
[2643.68 --> 2644.22]  Not an apple.
[2644.22 --> 2646.30]  It's a mustard seed.
[2647.66 --> 2647.98]  Mustard.
[2648.22 --> 2649.54]  Do you guys like to eat mustard?
[2649.54 --> 2652.18]  Do you put it on your sandwich or on your hot dog?
[2652.58 --> 2653.40]  So, look at it.
[2653.40 --> 2654.30]  It's a mustard seed.
[2654.40 --> 2654.96]  Don't eat it.
[2655.00 --> 2656.52]  If you bite it, it'll taste spicy.
[2656.52 --> 2658.82]  But you can hold it and it's fine.
[2659.42 --> 2664.90]  Now, the reason I'm telling you about this is because Jesus told a story about a mustard seed in the Bible.
[2665.50 --> 2666.72]  Let me read it for you.
[2666.72 --> 2669.34]  It says,
[2669.34 --> 2671.62]  Jesus told them another parable story.
[2672.78 --> 2679.10]  The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
[2679.10 --> 2687.82]  Though it is the smallest of all the seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest garden plant.
[2688.00 --> 2692.40]  It becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.
[2692.88 --> 2697.36]  So, who knows how big a mustard plant gets?
[2697.36 --> 2699.10]  How big do you think?
[2699.48 --> 2700.20]  How big?
[2701.10 --> 2702.84]  Is it smaller than me?
[2704.04 --> 2707.70]  No, it's actually taller than me.
[2707.76 --> 2708.34]  I have a picture.
[2708.48 --> 2709.58]  You want to see how big it is?
[2709.98 --> 2711.06]  Let's put it up here.
[2712.32 --> 2717.24]  So, that plant is a mustard tree or mustard plant.
[2717.66 --> 2720.92]  It actually can get up to 8 or 12 feet tall.
[2721.28 --> 2722.56]  So, look at the seed in your hand.
[2722.64 --> 2723.46]  See how small it is?
[2723.46 --> 2727.12]  But that can grow to be like that.
[2727.24 --> 2728.16]  It's bigger than me.
[2728.82 --> 2731.08]  It's bigger than your tomato plant at home in your garden.
[2731.24 --> 2732.16]  It gets so tall.
[2733.04 --> 2734.96]  But what if it does not get tall?
[2736.06 --> 2738.12]  It won't get that high, but it will get taller than me.
[2738.46 --> 2740.26]  So, this is why this is important.
[2741.40 --> 2747.48]  What Jesus wants to tell us is that sometimes small things don't seem very important.
[2748.86 --> 2750.96]  But they are important.
[2751.14 --> 2752.40]  They can become big.
[2752.40 --> 2758.56]  And so, God says his kingdom, his reign as Lord grows and it can become so big.
[2760.04 --> 2761.96]  But sometimes it seems very small.
[2762.08 --> 2762.82]  It seems unimportant.
[2763.02 --> 2764.18]  It seems not very powerful.
[2765.02 --> 2766.42]  So, things like this.
[2766.58 --> 2767.76]  You know what else is really small?
[2768.82 --> 2770.34]  Well, let me share something.
[2772.54 --> 2774.14]  Coming to church on Sunday.
[2774.70 --> 2776.30]  Sometimes it seems like a mustard seed.
[2776.40 --> 2777.24]  Maybe it's just small.
[2777.34 --> 2778.10]  It's not very important.
[2778.10 --> 2782.26]  Maybe reading the Bible or praying.
[2782.70 --> 2785.56]  Sometimes it seems maybe it's not that important.
[2785.96 --> 2789.84]  But actually, it grows bigger and bigger in our lives.
[2789.90 --> 2791.56]  It helps us to follow Jesus and know him.
[2791.76 --> 2792.80]  And it's very important.
[2793.66 --> 2793.82]  Okay.
[2793.82 --> 2794.84]  So, can you remember that?
[2797.36 --> 2798.04]  Say yes.
[2799.22 --> 2800.54]  Can you guys remember that?
[2800.62 --> 2800.82]  Good.
[2801.06 --> 2801.92]  Let me pray for you.
[2802.30 --> 2805.38]  Father, we thank you for the lesson of the mustard seed.
[2805.80 --> 2808.84]  That you take small, insignificant things.
[2808.92 --> 2810.80]  And, Lord, you bless them and make them big.
[2811.44 --> 2813.84]  Lord, help each one of us here, these children.
[2814.34 --> 2817.18]  Lord, to grow in knowing you.
[2817.44 --> 2818.90]  And that's the most important thing of life.
[2819.06 --> 2820.08]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2820.42 --> 2820.64]  Amen.
[2821.22 --> 2821.54]  Okay.
[2821.84 --> 2822.32]  See you later.
[2822.32 --> 2822.46]  Amen.
[2847.18 --> 2855.46]  This morning that the Chinese ministry is dismissed now as well.
[2855.46 --> 2878.88]  Scripture reading this morning is from Ephesians 6, verses 10 to 17.
[2879.22 --> 2880.76]  And it's about the armor of God.
[2880.76 --> 2886.52]  Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
[2887.64 --> 2893.30]  Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[2894.76 --> 2900.46]  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[2900.92 --> 2907.54]  against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[2907.54 --> 2917.46]  Therefore, put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground.
[2918.64 --> 2926.62]  And after you have done everything to stand, stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
[2927.40 --> 2935.80]  with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
[2935.80 --> 2945.80]  In addition to all of this, take up the shield of faith, by which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[2946.70 --> 2953.48]  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[2954.48 --> 2955.54]  Thanks be to God.
[2956.42 --> 2957.56]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2957.82 --> 2958.96]  Thanks be to God.
[2958.96 --> 2972.78]  Thank you, Ernst.
[2973.38 --> 2974.48]  Please join me in prayer.
[2976.44 --> 2980.08]  Heavenly Father, we ask that you would bless your word to us this morning,
[2980.54 --> 2985.50]  that we might be strengthened by it, so that we might stand firm.
[2985.50 --> 2992.04]  And we pray that you would use your sword, your word as your sword, that by the power of your Spirit,
[2992.44 --> 2999.06]  it might cut to our hearts, that we might be made new.
[2999.82 --> 3001.82]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3002.46 --> 3002.90]  Amen.
[3008.28 --> 3009.48]  Just bear with me a second.
[3009.60 --> 3010.58]  I'd like to remove this thing.
[3010.58 --> 3012.08]  Okay.
[3012.08 --> 3012.14]  Okay.
[3015.50 --> 3017.64]  All right.
[3017.70 --> 3018.36]  That's a bit better.
[3019.46 --> 3024.22]  So, the armor of God, spiritual enemies.
[3025.56 --> 3030.36]  Well, if you like fantasy stories, who likes fantasy stories here?
[3031.12 --> 3034.70]  It's kind of maybe nerdy or geeky or something.
[3035.24 --> 3041.86]  But maybe you like to read fantasy novels or watch fantasy movies or play video games.
[3041.86 --> 3054.84]  And if you do, you know that whenever you have to fight the great enemy, the big guy, at the end of the game or at the end of the book,
[3055.06 --> 3058.16]  you need special equipment.
[3059.16 --> 3059.36]  Right?
[3059.40 --> 3064.92]  You can't just take your usual stuff if you're going to go and fight giants and dragons.
[3064.92 --> 3072.84]  You're going to need, you know, that special bow and arrow that can pierce the scales of the dragon.
[3073.48 --> 3081.30]  You will likely need some healing elixirs to boost you up and help you stay engaged in the battle.
[3081.30 --> 3087.22]  And, of course, you're going to need the right kind of sword.
[3087.84 --> 3095.28]  It's going to have to be a special sword because you are not fighting an ordinary enemy.
[3096.38 --> 3101.00]  Well, the Bible is not quite a fantasy story because it's real.
[3101.20 --> 3102.10]  It is true.
[3102.10 --> 3108.60]  Though it does have many things that can strike us as fantastic.
[3109.64 --> 3118.16]  Indeed, this passage tells us that we are in a battle against supernatural enemies.
[3118.90 --> 3123.92]  In Western culture, that is considered to be a primitive idea.
[3125.00 --> 3129.58]  But the rest of the cultures in the world don't have any problem with it.
[3129.58 --> 3130.38]  Right?
[3130.56 --> 3140.46]  In Asia, in South America, in Africa, they don't have any doubt that there are real spiritual forces of evil at work in the world.
[3140.72 --> 3144.14]  In fact, it is often the best explanation for reality.
[3145.58 --> 3147.68]  And Paul doesn't have any problem with it either.
[3148.50 --> 3152.40]  Our passage today tells us that we are actually in a spiritual battle.
[3153.18 --> 3158.64]  And if we're in a battle, we need to know who it is we're fighting.
[3158.64 --> 3160.62]  We need to know who our enemy is.
[3160.90 --> 3165.42]  We need to know what special equipment we have to fight this enemy.
[3166.26 --> 3169.68]  And we need to know, is there hope for victory?
[3170.36 --> 3178.50]  So those are the things I'd like us to explore together, to look at as we look at this passage from Ephesians 6.
[3178.50 --> 3185.78]  And so, first, what do we learn here about our enemy in this struggle?
[3185.94 --> 3187.84]  That's our first point, our enemy in the struggle.
[3188.72 --> 3192.44]  And let's look, if you have your Bibles open or we'll put it on the screen as well.
[3192.84 --> 3194.94]  Verse 12 in our text says this.
[3194.94 --> 3217.36]  So these are actually references to evil spiritual entities.
[3217.36 --> 3222.34]  In the Gospels, Jesus and others call them demons.
[3223.42 --> 3230.32]  These are the forces of Satan, which have some level of power and authority in our world.
[3231.20 --> 3233.76]  They can make bad things happen.
[3234.70 --> 3237.30]  They are not flesh and blood.
[3239.02 --> 3241.98]  This is who we struggle against.
[3242.42 --> 3243.82]  You see that word struggle?
[3243.82 --> 3247.82]  The word struggle here is not actually the normal word for a battle.
[3248.08 --> 3251.90]  It's a word that actually means to wrestle.
[3253.12 --> 3256.44]  So I have an image of a wrestler for you.
[3256.56 --> 3260.66]  Wrestling was a popular sport in the ancient Greco-Roman world.
[3261.70 --> 3265.96]  And in describing the spiritual battle as a wrestling match,
[3265.96 --> 3272.64]  Paul is depicting it in terms that are up close and personal.
[3272.64 --> 3276.08]  I have never wrestled as a sport.
[3276.24 --> 3278.24]  I mean, sometimes you wrestle with your friends, that kind of thing.
[3278.32 --> 3281.30]  But has anybody ever wrestled, like real wrestling?
[3282.32 --> 3283.68]  Okay, no, yeah, me neither.
[3284.76 --> 3288.06]  So one of the fun things about sermon preparation,
[3288.28 --> 3289.76]  sometimes you just have to go on YouTube.
[3290.54 --> 3295.22]  So I went on YouTube to get a better idea of what Paul is talking about.
[3295.26 --> 3296.28]  This is the word that's used.
[3296.28 --> 3299.40]  And so I watched some wrestling matches.
[3299.82 --> 3305.00]  And what you will notice if you watch a wrestling match is that it starts
[3305.00 --> 3307.04]  and they kind of get in this position.
[3308.56 --> 3311.10]  And it doesn't look like there's much happening at first.
[3311.86 --> 3318.02]  But what the wrestlers are doing is that they are exploring the other person's body.
[3318.02 --> 3325.86]  Every inch of your opponent's body is explored until that moment comes
[3325.86 --> 3330.60]  when you find a point of leverage, you find a vulnerability, a weakness.
[3331.28 --> 3335.46]  And in that moment, you do a move and you can flip your opponent
[3335.46 --> 3336.68]  and try to pin them down.
[3336.68 --> 3340.84]  When we are in a wrestling match with Satan,
[3341.08 --> 3345.06]  he is exploring every inch of your soul
[3345.06 --> 3352.80]  to find that particular point of leverage so that he can flip you.
[3354.66 --> 3356.38]  And verse 11 says,
[3357.38 --> 3363.84]  put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[3363.84 --> 3368.64]  The Greek word for scheme is methodeia.
[3369.64 --> 3371.88]  What English word does that sound like?
[3372.10 --> 3372.74]  Methodeia.
[3374.02 --> 3374.46]  Method.
[3375.28 --> 3377.34]  The devil has a method.
[3377.84 --> 3379.86]  The devil is methodical,
[3380.46 --> 3383.32]  seeking to explore every inch of your life
[3383.32 --> 3387.14]  so that he can flip you and pin you down.
[3388.10 --> 3389.48]  And so here's how the devil works.
[3389.48 --> 3393.90]  Now I've heard this and I forgot to verify with Paul ahead of time.
[3394.26 --> 3396.44]  But I've heard, hopefully it's true,
[3396.78 --> 3398.50]  that you can open up a piano
[3398.50 --> 3403.34]  and you can sing a note into it.
[3403.80 --> 3405.78]  And whatever note you sing,
[3405.88 --> 3408.50]  that string in the piano will vibrate.
[3409.68 --> 3411.90]  Whichever string is tuned to your voice,
[3412.46 --> 3414.76]  right, it'll play that single note.
[3414.76 --> 3415.88]  And you don't even have to touch it.
[3416.10 --> 3417.54]  You don't have to play the key.
[3417.82 --> 3420.02]  It will vibrate to your voice.
[3421.76 --> 3422.12]  Yes.
[3423.12 --> 3423.40]  Phew.
[3423.78 --> 3425.32]  If not, it's still interesting.
[3425.66 --> 3426.60]  But it's better if it's true.
[3426.60 --> 3427.94]  You have to have the pedal down.
[3428.12 --> 3429.08]  But a lot of the strings are great.
[3429.14 --> 3429.42]  Okay.
[3429.62 --> 3431.86]  If you go home, you just yell at me down.
[3431.86 --> 3433.54]  Oh, because it's not, yeah.
[3434.02 --> 3434.38]  Okay.
[3435.66 --> 3436.98]  Yeah, so if you put the pedal down,
[3437.04 --> 3438.40]  it loosens up, you know, the strings are free.
[3438.60 --> 3439.08]  And yeah.
[3439.56 --> 3441.70]  Now, you have to be able to sing a particular note.
[3443.58 --> 3446.80]  But if you can, I suppose that would work.
[3447.62 --> 3449.36]  So this is kind of what the devil does.
[3449.98 --> 3453.16]  The devil plays what's already in you.
[3453.78 --> 3455.92]  So you can never say, the devil made me do it.
[3456.44 --> 3456.66]  Right?
[3456.66 --> 3459.74]  The devil can't make a bad person,
[3460.50 --> 3462.24]  or a good person bad.
[3463.02 --> 3464.30]  But he can tempt you.
[3465.12 --> 3467.70]  He can pull your strings, so to speak.
[3467.70 --> 3472.22]  He can find your weak spot and use it to his advantage.
[3473.12 --> 3475.04]  And that's why Paul says in Ephesians,
[3475.10 --> 3477.72]  back in chapter 4, verse 26,
[3477.96 --> 3478.68]  this is what he says.
[3479.00 --> 3480.48]  In your anger, do not sin.
[3480.82 --> 3482.22]  Do not let the sun go down.
[3482.30 --> 3483.20]  While you are still angry,
[3483.32 --> 3485.70]  do not give the devil a foothold.
[3486.86 --> 3487.06]  Right?
[3487.12 --> 3489.26]  If you are angry, if you are bitter,
[3489.84 --> 3494.26]  that gives the devil an opportunity to flip you.
[3494.26 --> 3497.74]  He finds the sin that is already there,
[3498.16 --> 3505.70]  and he exploits it in order to try to separate you from your life with God,
[3506.04 --> 3508.76]  and to separate you from your life with one another,
[3509.60 --> 3510.74]  especially in the church.
[3512.04 --> 3513.48]  So that we wrestle,
[3514.08 --> 3517.70]  so what we wrestle against is the devil's schemes.
[3517.70 --> 3521.36]  But not only is he methodical,
[3521.90 --> 3523.72]  he is also relentless.
[3524.70 --> 3525.96]  Look at verse 13.
[3527.06 --> 3528.90]  Therefore, put on the full armor of God,
[3528.96 --> 3532.00]  so that when the day of evil comes,
[3532.72 --> 3534.56]  you may be able to stand your ground.
[3534.72 --> 3535.72]  So Paul tells us here,
[3536.14 --> 3538.64]  when the devil will attack in the day of evil.
[3539.68 --> 3544.68]  Now this may refer to that final cosmic battle of good and evil,
[3544.68 --> 3547.64]  when Jesus returns and consummates all of history.
[3548.30 --> 3551.00]  That might be the day of evil that Paul is talking about here.
[3551.60 --> 3554.10]  But in chapter 5, verse 16,
[3554.28 --> 3555.54]  Paul has already said,
[3555.62 --> 3555.88]  remember,
[3556.22 --> 3557.78]  make the most of every opportunity.
[3558.04 --> 3558.26]  Why?
[3558.90 --> 3562.80]  Because the days are evil.
[3563.58 --> 3565.12]  So from the context of the letter,
[3565.20 --> 3568.62]  it seems to be much more about our daily lives.
[3568.62 --> 3571.48]  So I think what Paul has in mind here
[3571.48 --> 3573.16]  is that there will come a day,
[3573.28 --> 3575.44]  there will come many days,
[3576.16 --> 3579.10]  when the devil will seek to flip you.
[3580.04 --> 3581.40]  Maybe there will come a day
[3581.40 --> 3585.80]  when you're tempted to go to that website of pornography.
[3586.94 --> 3588.38]  Maybe there will come a day
[3588.38 --> 3590.98]  when you've just had it with that other person.
[3591.22 --> 3593.40]  You can't bite your tongue any longer.
[3593.72 --> 3595.60]  You just blurt it out.
[3595.60 --> 3599.42]  But those words that you cannot stick back into your mouth.
[3600.98 --> 3604.38]  There will be many days of evil
[3604.38 --> 3607.76]  that will come barreling down on us,
[3608.08 --> 3610.08]  when the devil will tempt us to sin,
[3610.38 --> 3612.52]  when he will play our strings,
[3612.58 --> 3613.74]  what is already in us,
[3613.78 --> 3617.10]  and try to do spiritual harm to us.
[3618.40 --> 3619.86]  So on the one hand,
[3620.24 --> 3624.72]  this spiritual struggle is very up close and personal.
[3624.72 --> 3626.22]  It's like a wrestling match.
[3626.96 --> 3630.30]  The devil does try to attack us personally,
[3630.84 --> 3632.84]  but I also want to make sure,
[3633.46 --> 3634.68]  to make this point,
[3634.76 --> 3638.22]  that our struggle also takes structural forms.
[3638.80 --> 3641.34]  When Paul says our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[3641.40 --> 3645.74]  he's not saying that evil is only ever spiritual and unseen.
[3646.06 --> 3650.88]  Evil manifests itself in all sorts of human structures.
[3650.88 --> 3654.38]  Remember, where is Paul writing from?
[3656.16 --> 3656.76]  Prison.
[3657.76 --> 3659.52]  He is in chains,
[3660.36 --> 3662.56]  physical, literal chains,
[3662.88 --> 3664.50]  for preaching the gospel.
[3665.34 --> 3667.78]  So sin and the spiritual forces of darkness
[3667.78 --> 3673.40]  actually take shape in the structures of the world,
[3673.48 --> 3674.38]  the political structures,
[3674.68 --> 3676.62]  the social, the cultural structures.
[3676.62 --> 3680.92]  Think about the evil leaders in this world.
[3682.06 --> 3685.48]  Think about war and violence.
[3686.42 --> 3689.28]  Think about materialism and greed
[3689.28 --> 3693.16]  and racism and sex trafficking
[3693.16 --> 3695.46]  and addiction and poverty.
[3695.94 --> 3696.78]  These are all,
[3697.52 --> 3699.64]  these all have spiritual forces
[3699.64 --> 3702.88]  behind and above these things.
[3702.88 --> 3704.98]  And the church of Jesus Christ
[3704.98 --> 3706.40]  is called to shine a light
[3706.40 --> 3707.68]  into those dark places,
[3707.68 --> 3709.98]  to tear down structures of injustice,
[3709.98 --> 3714.04]  to rescue prisoners from evil's grasp
[3714.04 --> 3717.48]  because God is renewing all things
[3717.48 --> 3720.36]  and he will not stand for any traces of evil
[3720.36 --> 3722.62]  ultimately to be left in this world.
[3724.36 --> 3725.30]  Paul says,
[3725.42 --> 3727.46]  we are fighting the spiritual forces of evil
[3727.46 --> 3730.04]  that actively seek to separate us
[3730.04 --> 3731.02]  from our life with God
[3731.02 --> 3733.82]  and to plague the world
[3733.82 --> 3735.88]  with spiritual harm.
[3737.98 --> 3738.98]  That's our enemy.
[3740.10 --> 3740.70]  Now secondly,
[3740.90 --> 3744.78]  Paul turns to our armor for the battle.
[3745.70 --> 3747.08]  Our armor for the battle.
[3749.16 --> 3749.78]  There it is.
[3750.62 --> 3750.92]  Now,
[3751.62 --> 3752.66]  if we are wrestling
[3752.66 --> 3754.74]  against flesh and blood,
[3755.16 --> 3756.42]  we would use
[3756.42 --> 3759.16]  flesh and blood weapons.
[3759.16 --> 3763.36]  If our main problem in life was money,
[3763.96 --> 3765.64]  we would be gathered here today
[3765.64 --> 3767.24]  to have a job fair,
[3768.04 --> 3769.34]  to have a resume workshop,
[3770.54 --> 3771.84]  and to go out
[3771.84 --> 3773.70]  and make sure we all get good jobs.
[3774.96 --> 3777.88]  If our main problem in life was politics,
[3778.00 --> 3778.86]  maybe we would gather
[3778.86 --> 3780.06]  and hold a political rally
[3780.06 --> 3782.30]  or we would get together groups
[3782.30 --> 3783.14]  to go door to door
[3783.14 --> 3785.06]  and convince them of our platform.
[3785.06 --> 3790.58]  But our biggest problem,
[3791.16 --> 3791.88]  Paul says,
[3793.12 --> 3795.90]  our struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[3796.74 --> 3797.96]  And so the armor and the weapons
[3797.96 --> 3798.80]  we're going to need
[3798.80 --> 3799.88]  to defeat this enemy
[3799.88 --> 3801.72]  must also be
[3801.72 --> 3804.48]  spiritual armor and weapons.
[3805.52 --> 3807.30]  The Apostle Paul gives them to us
[3807.30 --> 3807.90]  in this text.
[3807.90 --> 3809.94]  He explains to us
[3809.94 --> 3811.98]  what we must use
[3811.98 --> 3814.40]  to guard against
[3814.40 --> 3816.04]  the attacks of our enemy.
[3816.44 --> 3817.20]  And these are
[3817.20 --> 3818.58]  the armor of God.
[3819.46 --> 3821.16]  So let's read this part again
[3821.16 --> 3821.94]  of our passage,
[3822.54 --> 3824.46]  beginning in verse 14.
[3824.46 --> 3827.08]  So what Paul says,
[3827.16 --> 3828.08]  stand firm then
[3828.08 --> 3830.02]  with the belt of truth
[3830.02 --> 3831.24]  buckled around your waist,
[3831.72 --> 3832.86]  with the breastplate
[3832.86 --> 3834.24]  of righteousness in place,
[3834.80 --> 3835.94]  and with your feet fitted
[3835.94 --> 3836.56]  with a readiness
[3836.56 --> 3838.94]  that comes from the gospel of peace.
[3839.56 --> 3840.86]  In addition to all this,
[3840.96 --> 3842.16]  take up the shield of faith
[3842.16 --> 3843.84]  with which you can extinguish
[3843.84 --> 3844.86]  all the flaming arrows
[3844.86 --> 3845.74]  of the evil one.
[3846.32 --> 3847.96]  Take the helmet of salvation
[3847.96 --> 3849.68]  and the sword of the spirit,
[3849.78 --> 3851.98]  which is the word of God.
[3852.20 --> 3852.30]  Right?
[3852.38 --> 3853.04]  This is a,
[3853.04 --> 3854.16]  you know,
[3854.20 --> 3855.20]  we learned this passage
[3855.20 --> 3856.16]  when we were kids
[3856.16 --> 3856.74]  in Sunday school
[3856.74 --> 3858.02]  and they have the stick up things
[3858.02 --> 3858.42]  and you can,
[3858.82 --> 3859.60]  the soldier, right?
[3859.70 --> 3860.86]  And the soldier there
[3860.86 --> 3861.76]  that we often have
[3861.76 --> 3863.18]  in our Sunday school classrooms
[3863.18 --> 3866.60]  is an ancient Roman soldier.
[3866.72 --> 3867.46]  This is the armor
[3867.46 --> 3868.96]  that he would wear.
[3869.64 --> 3870.40]  And this is what Paul
[3870.40 --> 3871.06]  is drawing from.
[3872.38 --> 3873.88]  But what I want us to see
[3873.88 --> 3875.72]  is that basically
[3875.72 --> 3877.48]  each piece of the armor,
[3878.34 --> 3879.32]  what it is,
[3879.72 --> 3881.16]  is it is describing
[3881.16 --> 3883.94]  our life with Christ.
[3884.94 --> 3886.64]  They are all gifts
[3886.64 --> 3888.24]  of our life with God
[3888.24 --> 3890.68]  and they're also foils
[3890.68 --> 3892.00]  against the devil
[3892.00 --> 3892.94]  who would seek
[3892.94 --> 3894.70]  to destroy that life.
[3895.70 --> 3896.88]  So Paul is reminding us
[3896.88 --> 3898.46]  in whatever battle we face
[3898.46 --> 3900.48]  where Satan seeks
[3900.48 --> 3902.78]  to find that point of leverage
[3902.78 --> 3905.14]  in that time,
[3905.22 --> 3905.92]  in that struggle,
[3906.04 --> 3906.72]  in that battle,
[3906.72 --> 3907.86]  you need to remember
[3907.86 --> 3910.16]  who you are in Christ.
[3911.06 --> 3912.38]  And so let's take a moment
[3912.38 --> 3913.40]  briefly to look
[3913.40 --> 3914.48]  at each one of these, okay?
[3914.66 --> 3916.14]  So the first piece of the armor,
[3917.06 --> 3917.80]  Paul says,
[3917.94 --> 3919.64]  is the belt of truth.
[3920.72 --> 3922.54]  This is from our life with God.
[3922.78 --> 3923.78]  It's knowing God.
[3923.88 --> 3925.10]  It's knowing the truth
[3925.10 --> 3925.94]  of who God is.
[3926.02 --> 3926.72]  It's the knowledge
[3926.72 --> 3928.36]  of the reality of God.
[3928.90 --> 3930.90]  All that is true in the world.
[3930.90 --> 3933.28]  And this is indeed
[3933.28 --> 3936.64]  a foil against Satan's deceits
[3936.64 --> 3939.34]  because Satan basically
[3939.34 --> 3940.74]  is a liar.
[3941.56 --> 3943.04]  That's what Jesus calls him
[3943.04 --> 3945.02]  in John chapter 8 verse 44.
[3945.90 --> 3946.64]  Jesus says,
[3947.24 --> 3947.94]  he was a murderer
[3947.94 --> 3948.76]  from the beginning,
[3949.02 --> 3950.44]  not holding to the truth,
[3950.54 --> 3951.90]  for there is no truth in him.
[3952.40 --> 3953.28]  When he lies,
[3953.58 --> 3954.98]  he speaks his native language,
[3955.10 --> 3955.94]  for he is a liar
[3955.94 --> 3958.02]  and the father of lies.
[3958.02 --> 3958.46]  Right?
[3959.88 --> 3961.04]  Satan and his demons
[3961.04 --> 3962.40]  are constantly seeking
[3962.40 --> 3964.90]  to whisper lies
[3964.90 --> 3966.46]  in your ear.
[3967.36 --> 3968.00]  Right?
[3968.06 --> 3969.94]  The lie that pleasure
[3969.94 --> 3971.18]  and wealth
[3971.18 --> 3972.64]  is the meaning of life.
[3972.84 --> 3973.94]  That's what gives you happiness.
[3975.20 --> 3977.60]  The lie that you are a prisoner
[3977.60 --> 3979.88]  to your past family history.
[3981.02 --> 3982.30]  The lie that
[3982.30 --> 3983.76]  that character flaw,
[3983.86 --> 3984.88]  that personality flaw
[3984.88 --> 3985.52]  that you have
[3985.52 --> 3987.68]  is just an inevitable
[3987.68 --> 3988.96]  part of your life
[3988.96 --> 3990.20]  and that you will never change.
[3991.80 --> 3994.00]  The lie that you are
[3994.00 --> 3995.06]  what it says
[3995.06 --> 3996.44]  on your business card.
[3996.96 --> 3998.62]  That is what gives you value
[3998.62 --> 3999.42]  and identity.
[4000.58 --> 4000.68]  Right?
[4000.76 --> 4001.54]  Satan whispers
[4001.54 --> 4002.94]  those lies in your ear.
[4003.94 --> 4006.08]  And so to fight Satan,
[4006.22 --> 4006.90]  first and foremost,
[4007.02 --> 4008.62]  we must know the truth.
[4009.18 --> 4010.22]  We must know
[4010.22 --> 4011.94]  the truth about ourselves,
[4012.48 --> 4014.26]  that we are children of God.
[4014.26 --> 4016.76]  We must know the truth
[4016.76 --> 4017.76]  about God.
[4017.86 --> 4019.28]  This is why truth is important.
[4019.88 --> 4020.02]  Okay?
[4020.02 --> 4020.92]  We must put on
[4020.92 --> 4022.16]  the belt of truth.
[4023.02 --> 4024.56]  Now the second piece of armor
[4024.56 --> 4025.82]  is the breastplate
[4025.82 --> 4026.38]  of righteousness.
[4027.58 --> 4028.56]  Righteousness is from
[4028.56 --> 4029.46]  our life with God.
[4029.58 --> 4030.60]  God is righteous
[4030.60 --> 4032.44]  and he makes us
[4032.44 --> 4034.02]  righteous in Christ
[4034.02 --> 4035.48]  through faith in him.
[4036.48 --> 4037.40]  And when the devil
[4037.40 --> 4038.50]  comes to attack you,
[4038.94 --> 4040.22]  one of the schemes
[4040.22 --> 4040.96]  of the devil
[4040.96 --> 4042.02]  is to what?
[4042.02 --> 4044.60]  Is to point out
[4044.60 --> 4045.70]  your sin.
[4047.00 --> 4048.84]  Satan literally means
[4048.84 --> 4050.54]  the accuser.
[4051.40 --> 4052.60]  And what makes him
[4052.60 --> 4053.58]  so effective
[4053.58 --> 4055.06]  is that
[4055.06 --> 4056.58]  you do sin.
[4057.58 --> 4057.80]  Right?
[4057.86 --> 4059.66]  He's not just making it all up.
[4059.82 --> 4060.80]  He does lie.
[4061.16 --> 4061.84]  But there's also
[4061.84 --> 4062.66]  the truth there.
[4062.92 --> 4064.02]  He's exploring you
[4064.02 --> 4064.98]  for those weak spots
[4064.98 --> 4067.12]  where you
[4067.12 --> 4068.20]  do
[4068.20 --> 4069.44]  tend
[4069.44 --> 4070.72]  to sin.
[4070.72 --> 4072.66]  So when
[4072.66 --> 4073.52]  that darkness
[4073.52 --> 4074.62]  of shame,
[4075.18 --> 4076.40]  the lies of Satan,
[4076.48 --> 4077.44]  the accusations
[4077.44 --> 4078.16]  of Satan,
[4078.34 --> 4079.44]  they seek to make you
[4079.44 --> 4080.60]  doubt and question
[4080.60 --> 4082.16]  your life with God,
[4082.66 --> 4083.80]  you are to put
[4083.80 --> 4084.72]  on
[4084.72 --> 4085.94]  the breastplate
[4085.94 --> 4087.54]  of righteousness.
[4088.54 --> 4089.40]  The righteousness
[4089.40 --> 4090.54]  that says
[4090.54 --> 4091.82]  that you are
[4091.82 --> 4093.36]  acceptable
[4093.36 --> 4094.28]  in God
[4094.28 --> 4095.24]  the Father's sight.
[4095.24 --> 4097.24]  that is what
[4097.24 --> 4097.86]  protects you.
[4097.92 --> 4098.86]  That is your defense.
[4099.18 --> 4100.08]  The fact that Jesus
[4100.08 --> 4101.20]  is the perfect
[4101.20 --> 4102.08]  spotless lamb
[4102.08 --> 4102.60]  that he was
[4102.60 --> 4103.40]  without sin
[4103.40 --> 4105.42]  that God gave him
[4105.42 --> 4107.16]  to die in our place
[4107.16 --> 4108.54]  to make atonement
[4108.54 --> 4109.20]  for us
[4109.20 --> 4110.46]  so that we might
[4110.46 --> 4111.22]  then become
[4111.22 --> 4111.98]  the righteousness
[4111.98 --> 4112.70]  of God
[4112.70 --> 4113.96]  where the righteousness
[4113.96 --> 4114.92]  of Christ
[4114.92 --> 4116.78]  is transferred
[4116.78 --> 4118.14]  to our account.
[4118.14 --> 4120.46]  And if we are
[4120.46 --> 4121.00]  confident
[4121.00 --> 4122.48]  that in God's
[4122.48 --> 4122.74]  sight
[4122.74 --> 4123.88]  we are righteous,
[4124.64 --> 4125.30]  that we have
[4125.30 --> 4125.76]  the righteousness
[4125.76 --> 4126.58]  of Christ,
[4127.00 --> 4127.84]  then we are
[4127.84 --> 4128.46]  invincible
[4128.46 --> 4129.26]  in the face
[4129.26 --> 4129.70]  of Satan.
[4129.88 --> 4130.54]  None of his
[4130.54 --> 4131.18]  accusations
[4131.18 --> 4133.18]  can get off
[4133.18 --> 4133.76]  the ground.
[4135.16 --> 4135.62]  Satan will
[4135.62 --> 4136.28]  accuse us
[4136.28 --> 4136.88]  of sin
[4136.88 --> 4138.54]  and we
[4138.54 --> 4139.16]  can just
[4139.16 --> 4139.96]  confess it
[4139.96 --> 4140.36]  to God
[4140.36 --> 4140.66]  just saying
[4140.66 --> 4141.22]  you're right.
[4141.86 --> 4143.34]  I am a sinner
[4143.34 --> 4144.76]  but I wear
[4144.76 --> 4145.78]  the righteousness
[4145.78 --> 4146.42]  of God.
[4147.22 --> 4147.92]  So ultimately
[4147.92 --> 4148.98]  his accusations
[4148.98 --> 4150.34]  will not stick.
[4152.04 --> 4152.92]  Now thirdly
[4152.92 --> 4153.76]  Paul mentions
[4153.76 --> 4154.58]  our feet.
[4155.48 --> 4156.26]  You've got to
[4156.26 --> 4156.88]  have the right
[4156.88 --> 4157.58]  shoes on
[4157.58 --> 4158.56]  and in this case
[4158.56 --> 4160.02]  it's the gospel
[4160.02 --> 4160.74]  of peace.
[4162.26 --> 4163.60]  We read earlier
[4163.60 --> 4164.12]  I think it was
[4164.12 --> 4164.94]  our call to worship
[4164.94 --> 4166.28]  Isaiah 52 7
[4166.28 --> 4167.62]  where again
[4167.62 --> 4168.38]  it says this
[4168.38 --> 4169.14]  how beautiful
[4169.14 --> 4169.88]  on the mountains
[4169.88 --> 4171.08]  look at the same
[4171.08 --> 4171.46]  language
[4171.46 --> 4172.64]  are the feet
[4172.64 --> 4174.06]  of those who bring
[4174.06 --> 4174.86]  good news
[4174.86 --> 4175.30]  gospel
[4175.30 --> 4175.40]  people
[4175.40 --> 4176.84]  who proclaim
[4176.84 --> 4178.10]  peace.
[4178.90 --> 4179.00]  Right?
[4179.52 --> 4180.34]  And then what
[4180.34 --> 4181.66]  does this one
[4181.66 --> 4183.28]  proclaiming peace
[4183.28 --> 4183.88]  say?
[4185.40 --> 4186.52]  Who bring
[4186.52 --> 4187.48]  good tidings
[4187.48 --> 4188.20]  who proclaim
[4188.20 --> 4188.70]  salvation
[4188.70 --> 4189.54]  who say to
[4189.54 --> 4190.14]  Zion what?
[4191.16 --> 4192.20]  Your God
[4192.20 --> 4193.12]  reigns.
[4193.78 --> 4194.72]  Why do we
[4194.72 --> 4195.40]  have peace?
[4195.98 --> 4196.84]  Because your
[4196.84 --> 4197.86]  God is king.
[4198.54 --> 4199.20]  Your God
[4199.20 --> 4200.34]  is reigning
[4200.34 --> 4201.26]  over all
[4201.26 --> 4201.94]  things
[4201.94 --> 4203.18]  and so you
[4203.18 --> 4203.68]  can trust
[4203.68 --> 4203.94]  him.
[4205.30 --> 4206.08]  Peace
[4206.08 --> 4206.94]  is part
[4206.94 --> 4207.16]  of our
[4207.16 --> 4207.44]  life
[4207.44 --> 4207.98]  with God.
[4208.46 --> 4208.74]  Christ
[4208.74 --> 4209.02]  has
[4209.02 --> 4209.78]  reconciled
[4209.78 --> 4210.02]  us to
[4210.02 --> 4210.24]  God
[4210.24 --> 4210.54]  through the
[4210.54 --> 4210.86]  gospel.
[4211.04 --> 4211.22]  We have
[4211.22 --> 4211.48]  peace
[4211.48 --> 4211.96]  with God
[4211.96 --> 4212.64]  and others
[4212.64 --> 4213.70]  and this
[4213.70 --> 4214.36]  peace is a
[4214.36 --> 4215.52]  foil against
[4215.52 --> 4217.24]  Satan's
[4217.24 --> 4217.84]  attempts
[4217.84 --> 4219.18]  to bring
[4219.18 --> 4219.70]  division
[4219.70 --> 4221.04]  and opposition.
[4222.90 --> 4223.40]  So fourth
[4223.40 --> 4224.04]  is the shield
[4224.04 --> 4224.52]  of faith.
[4224.90 --> 4225.26]  The type
[4225.26 --> 4225.66]  of shield
[4225.66 --> 4226.28]  Paul is using
[4226.28 --> 4226.58]  here.
[4226.94 --> 4227.20]  The shield
[4227.20 --> 4227.48]  of faith.
[4227.56 --> 4227.90]  There's two
[4227.90 --> 4228.56]  kinds of shields
[4228.56 --> 4228.96]  I guess
[4228.96 --> 4229.88]  in the Roman
[4229.88 --> 4230.12]  army.
[4230.12 --> 4231.32]  One is this
[4231.32 --> 4231.86]  little round
[4231.86 --> 4232.22]  one.
[4232.50 --> 4232.76]  It's kind of
[4232.76 --> 4233.06]  used for
[4233.06 --> 4233.48]  fending off
[4233.48 --> 4233.86]  blows.
[4234.40 --> 4234.84]  But then
[4234.84 --> 4235.52]  there's this
[4235.52 --> 4236.84]  big long
[4236.84 --> 4237.74]  oblong
[4237.74 --> 4238.56]  shield.
[4239.18 --> 4239.52]  So it was
[4239.52 --> 4240.06]  about four
[4240.06 --> 4240.42]  and a half
[4240.42 --> 4241.02]  feet high
[4241.02 --> 4241.54]  about two
[4241.54 --> 4242.20]  feet long
[4242.20 --> 4244.40]  and it
[4244.40 --> 4245.30]  covered the
[4245.30 --> 4245.82]  soldier's
[4245.82 --> 4246.62]  entire body.
[4247.40 --> 4247.76]  And so when
[4247.76 --> 4248.26]  the soldiers
[4248.26 --> 4249.28]  advanced together
[4249.28 --> 4250.42]  in rows as
[4250.42 --> 4251.16]  the Romans did
[4251.16 --> 4251.76]  the enemy
[4251.76 --> 4252.56]  would face a
[4252.56 --> 4253.44]  wall of
[4253.44 --> 4253.94]  shields.
[4254.54 --> 4255.14]  Row upon
[4255.14 --> 4255.62]  row of
[4255.62 --> 4255.84]  them.
[4256.66 --> 4257.18]  And this is
[4257.18 --> 4257.68]  the image that
[4257.68 --> 4258.28]  Paul has in
[4258.28 --> 4258.86]  mind here.
[4258.86 --> 4259.96]  And he says
[4259.96 --> 4260.38]  this is what
[4260.38 --> 4260.78]  faith should
[4260.78 --> 4261.32]  be like.
[4261.72 --> 4262.76]  This wall
[4262.76 --> 4263.78]  of shields.
[4264.76 --> 4265.18]  And this
[4265.18 --> 4265.70]  kind of tells
[4265.70 --> 4266.02]  us three
[4266.02 --> 4266.40]  things.
[4266.52 --> 4267.46]  One, it
[4267.46 --> 4267.94]  should cover
[4267.94 --> 4268.40]  us so that
[4268.40 --> 4268.98]  nothing is
[4268.98 --> 4269.42]  exposed.
[4269.62 --> 4269.96]  Faith can
[4269.96 --> 4270.68]  cover every
[4270.68 --> 4271.14]  part of
[4271.14 --> 4272.18]  our lives.
[4273.12 --> 4273.82]  It should
[4273.82 --> 4274.50]  link up
[4274.50 --> 4275.10]  with the
[4275.10 --> 4275.82]  faith of
[4275.82 --> 4277.12]  others to
[4277.12 --> 4278.08]  create a
[4278.08 --> 4278.72]  solid wall
[4278.72 --> 4279.40]  of defense.
[4280.48 --> 4280.72]  And then
[4280.72 --> 4281.30]  notice that
[4281.30 --> 4282.36]  it says it
[4282.36 --> 4283.48]  distinguishes
[4283.48 --> 4283.98]  all the
[4283.98 --> 4284.86]  flaming arrows
[4284.86 --> 4285.48]  of the evil
[4285.48 --> 4285.80]  one.
[4287.06 --> 4287.14]  Right?
[4287.36 --> 4287.82]  Satan is
[4287.82 --> 4288.22]  constantly
[4288.22 --> 4288.64]  shooting
[4288.64 --> 4289.18]  arrows at
[4289.18 --> 4289.44]  you.
[4290.22 --> 4290.68]  But you
[4290.68 --> 4291.10]  can use
[4291.10 --> 4291.86]  your shield
[4291.86 --> 4292.60]  to put
[4292.60 --> 4293.02]  out the
[4293.02 --> 4293.68]  flaming arrows
[4293.68 --> 4294.18]  of Satan.
[4295.32 --> 4295.98]  And friends,
[4296.16 --> 4296.94]  faith is also
[4296.94 --> 4297.46]  part of our
[4297.46 --> 4297.84]  life with
[4297.84 --> 4298.14]  God.
[4298.44 --> 4299.08]  It is an
[4299.08 --> 4299.76]  embrace of
[4299.76 --> 4300.52]  the promises
[4300.52 --> 4301.16]  of God
[4301.16 --> 4302.50]  and it's a
[4302.50 --> 4303.44]  foil against
[4303.44 --> 4303.94]  Satan's
[4303.94 --> 4304.38]  despair.
[4306.50 --> 4306.74]  Alright,
[4306.92 --> 4307.66]  fifth, I
[4307.66 --> 4307.90]  think there's
[4307.90 --> 4308.52]  only six, so
[4308.52 --> 4308.80]  we're almost
[4308.80 --> 4308.94]  there.
[4309.04 --> 4309.76]  Fifth, the
[4309.76 --> 4310.14]  helmet of
[4310.14 --> 4310.58]  salvation.
[4311.60 --> 4312.06]  The helmet
[4312.06 --> 4314.04]  is ultimately
[4314.04 --> 4314.48]  the most
[4314.48 --> 4315.24]  important piece
[4315.24 --> 4315.74]  of protective
[4315.74 --> 4316.20]  gear that we
[4316.20 --> 4316.64]  have, right?
[4316.64 --> 4317.78]  It protects
[4317.78 --> 4318.26]  your head.
[4319.04 --> 4319.48]  Salvation
[4319.48 --> 4320.10]  keeps you
[4320.10 --> 4320.64]  alive.
[4321.36 --> 4321.74]  And this
[4321.74 --> 4322.26]  is why we
[4322.26 --> 4322.72]  believe that
[4322.72 --> 4323.16]  in Christ
[4323.16 --> 4323.50]  you don't
[4323.50 --> 4323.98]  lose your
[4323.98 --> 4324.44]  salvation.
[4325.18 --> 4325.48]  The whole
[4325.48 --> 4325.78]  point of
[4325.78 --> 4326.60]  having salvation
[4326.60 --> 4327.36]  is to be
[4327.36 --> 4327.74]  protected.
[4328.50 --> 4328.84]  You can
[4328.84 --> 4329.66]  have confidence
[4329.66 --> 4330.98]  that you
[4330.98 --> 4331.64]  are safe
[4331.64 --> 4332.14]  in the battle.
[4332.26 --> 4332.66]  You're wearing
[4332.66 --> 4333.22]  this helmet.
[4333.62 --> 4334.12]  Nothing can
[4334.12 --> 4334.86]  ultimately harm
[4334.86 --> 4335.02]  you.
[4335.08 --> 4335.38]  You have
[4335.38 --> 4336.10]  the hope
[4336.10 --> 4336.86]  of salvation.
[4337.60 --> 4338.16]  And that
[4338.16 --> 4338.58]  gives us
[4338.58 --> 4339.14]  confidence
[4339.14 --> 4340.08]  to stand
[4340.08 --> 4340.30]  in the
[4340.30 --> 4340.58]  battle.
[4342.10 --> 4342.62]  Lastly
[4342.62 --> 4343.30]  comes the
[4343.30 --> 4343.60]  sword.
[4343.60 --> 4345.04]  commentators
[4345.04 --> 4345.64]  point out
[4345.64 --> 4346.42]  that this
[4346.42 --> 4346.72]  is the
[4346.72 --> 4346.96]  only
[4346.96 --> 4347.52]  obviously
[4347.52 --> 4348.84]  offensive
[4348.84 --> 4349.96]  weapon.
[4350.08 --> 4350.34]  All the
[4350.34 --> 4350.82]  rest are
[4350.82 --> 4351.52]  defensive.
[4352.66 --> 4353.44]  So the
[4353.44 --> 4353.82]  way we
[4353.82 --> 4354.26]  engage
[4354.26 --> 4354.66]  Satan,
[4354.78 --> 4355.20]  the forces
[4355.20 --> 4355.88]  of evil
[4355.88 --> 4357.02]  offensively,
[4357.54 --> 4358.14]  is with
[4358.14 --> 4359.54]  the sword
[4359.54 --> 4359.98]  of the
[4359.98 --> 4360.32]  spirit,
[4360.44 --> 4360.94]  which is
[4360.94 --> 4361.50]  the word
[4361.50 --> 4362.36]  of God.
[4363.92 --> 4364.56]  Think
[4364.56 --> 4365.60]  about the
[4365.60 --> 4366.16]  battle
[4366.16 --> 4367.50]  that Jesus
[4367.50 --> 4368.50]  had against
[4368.50 --> 4369.12]  Satan in
[4369.12 --> 4369.62]  the wilderness
[4369.62 --> 4371.04]  right after
[4371.04 --> 4371.72]  his baptism.
[4371.72 --> 4373.50]  when Jesus
[4373.50 --> 4374.26]  was tempted
[4374.26 --> 4374.96]  by Satan
[4374.96 --> 4375.32]  in the
[4375.32 --> 4375.64]  wilderness.
[4377.00 --> 4377.28]  Yes,
[4377.48 --> 4379.16]  he resisted.
[4379.60 --> 4380.00]  He had
[4380.00 --> 4380.42]  all the
[4380.42 --> 4380.98]  defenses.
[4382.22 --> 4382.94]  But what
[4382.94 --> 4383.38]  does he
[4383.38 --> 4384.34]  use finally
[4384.34 --> 4385.12]  to drive
[4385.12 --> 4385.94]  Satan away?
[4386.70 --> 4387.22]  Satan said,
[4387.34 --> 4387.84]  worship me
[4387.84 --> 4388.04]  and you
[4388.04 --> 4388.28]  will have
[4388.28 --> 4388.62]  all the
[4388.62 --> 4388.88]  kingdoms
[4388.88 --> 4389.28]  of the
[4389.28 --> 4389.60]  world.
[4390.64 --> 4390.96]  And what
[4390.96 --> 4391.38]  does Jesus
[4391.38 --> 4391.84]  use to
[4391.84 --> 4392.72]  fight Satan
[4392.72 --> 4393.12]  and drive
[4393.12 --> 4393.54]  him away?
[4394.24 --> 4395.10]  The word
[4395.10 --> 4395.72]  of God.
[4396.90 --> 4397.06]  Right?
[4397.28 --> 4398.06]  Jesus knew
[4398.06 --> 4398.64]  the scriptures.
[4399.50 --> 4399.78]  And so
[4399.78 --> 4400.38]  when Satan
[4400.38 --> 4401.64]  tried to
[4401.64 --> 4402.04]  use a
[4402.04 --> 4402.64]  part of
[4402.64 --> 4402.78]  the
[4402.78 --> 4403.10]  scripture
[4403.10 --> 4403.70]  in a
[4403.70 --> 4404.06]  false
[4404.06 --> 4404.52]  way,
[4405.26 --> 4405.52]  Jesus
[4405.52 --> 4405.98]  knows
[4405.98 --> 4406.20]  the
[4406.20 --> 4406.56]  true
[4406.56 --> 4406.98]  meaning
[4406.98 --> 4407.56]  and
[4407.56 --> 4407.68]  is
[4407.68 --> 4407.92]  able
[4407.92 --> 4408.14]  to
[4408.14 --> 4408.46]  quote
[4408.46 --> 4408.70]  the
[4408.70 --> 4409.12]  scriptures
[4409.12 --> 4410.34]  in full.
[4411.56 --> 4412.46]  This is
[4412.46 --> 4412.84]  our
[4412.84 --> 4413.74]  offensive
[4413.74 --> 4414.18]  weapon
[4414.18 --> 4414.56]  against
[4414.56 --> 4414.76]  the
[4414.76 --> 4415.02]  devil,
[4415.22 --> 4415.58]  knowing
[4415.58 --> 4416.40]  God's
[4416.40 --> 4416.88]  word.
[4418.16 --> 4418.36]  So
[4418.36 --> 4418.68]  friends,
[4419.50 --> 4420.54]  how are
[4420.54 --> 4420.90]  you with
[4420.90 --> 4421.50]  your sword?
[4421.64 --> 4421.76]  Right?
[4421.78 --> 4422.06]  That's the
[4422.06 --> 4423.08]  question that
[4423.08 --> 4423.44]  we have to
[4423.44 --> 4424.08]  ask ourselves.
[4424.94 --> 4425.88]  How well
[4425.88 --> 4426.84]  trained are
[4426.84 --> 4427.18]  you in
[4427.18 --> 4427.66]  using your
[4427.66 --> 4427.92]  sword?
[4428.92 --> 4429.44]  Are you
[4429.44 --> 4429.94]  reading the
[4429.94 --> 4430.22]  Bible?
[4431.08 --> 4431.76]  Are you
[4431.76 --> 4432.66]  taking it
[4432.66 --> 4432.92]  in?
[4432.98 --> 4433.24]  Are you
[4433.24 --> 4433.58]  really
[4433.58 --> 4434.48]  learning it?
[4435.52 --> 4435.94]  Do you
[4435.94 --> 4436.36]  know how
[4436.36 --> 4436.80]  to use
[4436.80 --> 4437.34]  the truth
[4437.34 --> 4437.60]  and the
[4437.60 --> 4438.00]  promises
[4438.00 --> 4438.28]  of
[4438.28 --> 4438.64]  scripture
[4438.64 --> 4439.34]  to
[4439.34 --> 4440.00]  counter
[4440.00 --> 4440.70]  Satan's
[4440.70 --> 4441.16]  lies
[4441.16 --> 4441.34]  and
[4441.34 --> 4441.92]  accusations?
[4443.20 --> 4443.36]  Right?
[4443.42 --> 4443.66]  If you
[4443.66 --> 4444.04]  were to
[4444.04 --> 4444.54]  encounter
[4444.54 --> 4445.16]  someone who
[4445.16 --> 4445.32]  is
[4445.32 --> 4445.76]  questioning
[4445.76 --> 4446.04]  their
[4446.04 --> 4446.46]  faith
[4446.46 --> 4447.26]  or a
[4447.26 --> 4447.50]  false
[4447.50 --> 4447.90]  teacher,
[4448.00 --> 4448.14]  would
[4448.14 --> 4448.40]  you be
[4448.40 --> 4448.68]  able to
[4448.68 --> 4449.02]  answer
[4449.02 --> 4449.44]  them
[4449.44 --> 4449.82]  with
[4449.82 --> 4450.14]  God's
[4450.14 --> 4450.42]  word?
[4451.42 --> 4451.94]  You
[4451.94 --> 4452.38]  have been
[4452.38 --> 4452.66]  given
[4452.66 --> 4453.00]  a
[4453.00 --> 4453.46]  valuable
[4453.46 --> 4454.02]  weapon,
[4454.42 --> 4455.22]  but you
[4455.22 --> 4455.92]  have to
[4455.92 --> 4457.16]  train
[4457.16 --> 4457.76]  to use
[4457.76 --> 4457.88]  it
[4457.88 --> 4458.32]  effectively.
[4458.48 --> 4458.56]  You
[4458.56 --> 4458.88]  have to
[4458.88 --> 4459.42]  be committed
[4459.42 --> 4459.90]  to
[4459.90 --> 4460.26]  learning
[4460.26 --> 4460.86]  how to
[4460.86 --> 4461.16]  use
[4461.16 --> 4461.32]  it.
[4461.52 --> 4462.16]  If you're
[4462.16 --> 4462.58]  a soldier
[4462.58 --> 4462.94]  and your
[4462.94 --> 4463.38]  sword is
[4463.38 --> 4463.62]  up on
[4463.62 --> 4464.10]  the shelf
[4464.10 --> 4464.68]  and you're
[4464.68 --> 4465.02]  getting
[4465.02 --> 4465.46]  attacked,
[4465.54 --> 4465.84]  you're like,
[4466.10 --> 4466.60]  where's that
[4466.60 --> 4466.90]  sword?
[4467.16 --> 4467.60]  And then once
[4467.60 --> 4468.00]  you get it,
[4468.06 --> 4468.44]  I don't know
[4468.44 --> 4468.74]  what to do
[4468.74 --> 4468.98]  with this
[4468.98 --> 4469.16]  thing.
[4470.16 --> 4470.88]  That's not
[4470.88 --> 4471.26]  going to do
[4471.26 --> 4471.72]  any good.
[4471.72 --> 4474.88]  So if
[4474.88 --> 4475.18]  you go
[4475.18 --> 4475.90]  to the
[4475.90 --> 4477.60]  Wartburg
[4477.60 --> 4478.22]  castle
[4478.22 --> 4479.00]  in Germany,
[4479.92 --> 4480.28]  what you
[4480.28 --> 4480.70]  may see
[4480.70 --> 4481.12]  there in
[4481.12 --> 4481.30]  one of
[4481.30 --> 4481.80]  the rooms
[4481.80 --> 4482.24]  is this
[4482.24 --> 4482.82]  big ink
[4482.82 --> 4483.46]  stain on
[4483.46 --> 4483.88]  the wall.
[4485.48 --> 4486.12]  This is
[4486.12 --> 4486.62]  where Martin
[4486.62 --> 4487.12]  Luther was
[4487.12 --> 4487.60]  doing his
[4487.60 --> 4488.04]  work and
[4488.04 --> 4488.30]  what he
[4488.30 --> 4488.78]  was doing
[4488.78 --> 4489.56]  was translating
[4489.56 --> 4489.94]  the New
[4489.94 --> 4490.32]  Testament
[4490.32 --> 4491.88]  into the
[4491.88 --> 4492.16]  German
[4492.16 --> 4492.72]  language.
[4493.46 --> 4493.90]  He was
[4493.90 --> 4494.46]  getting the
[4494.46 --> 4495.00]  word of
[4495.00 --> 4495.78]  God into
[4495.78 --> 4496.42]  the hands
[4496.42 --> 4496.96]  of people
[4496.96 --> 4497.64]  who had
[4497.64 --> 4498.24]  never read
[4498.24 --> 4498.50]  it.
[4499.16 --> 4499.50]  He was
[4499.50 --> 4499.92]  forging
[4499.92 --> 4500.50]  swords.
[4501.30 --> 4501.52]  He was
[4501.52 --> 4502.08]  arming
[4502.08 --> 4503.74]  everyone.
[4505.08 --> 4505.60]  But while
[4505.60 --> 4505.90]  he was
[4505.90 --> 4506.40]  doing this
[4506.40 --> 4506.74]  work,
[4506.82 --> 4507.24]  he often
[4507.24 --> 4507.72]  felt like
[4507.72 --> 4508.04]  he was
[4508.04 --> 4508.28]  under
[4508.28 --> 4508.72]  spiritual
[4508.72 --> 4509.22]  attack.
[4509.94 --> 4510.40]  And one
[4510.40 --> 4510.66]  day,
[4510.82 --> 4511.34]  he sensed
[4511.34 --> 4511.90]  the devil's
[4511.90 --> 4512.52]  presence in
[4512.52 --> 4512.96]  the room,
[4513.66 --> 4514.18]  so he
[4514.18 --> 4514.78]  stood up
[4514.78 --> 4515.00]  and he
[4515.00 --> 4515.42]  took his
[4515.42 --> 4515.92]  inkwell
[4515.92 --> 4516.64]  and he
[4516.64 --> 4517.22]  threw
[4517.22 --> 4518.34]  it at
[4518.34 --> 4518.82]  the devil
[4518.82 --> 4519.40]  and it
[4519.40 --> 4520.18]  shattered
[4520.18 --> 4520.86]  against the
[4520.86 --> 4521.34]  wall and
[4521.34 --> 4521.74]  splattered
[4521.74 --> 4522.20]  ink on
[4522.20 --> 4522.52]  the wall.
[4523.52 --> 4523.72]  Now,
[4523.74 --> 4523.92]  I don't
[4523.92 --> 4524.30]  think that
[4524.30 --> 4524.92]  actually did
[4524.92 --> 4525.46]  anything to
[4525.46 --> 4525.80]  fight off
[4525.80 --> 4526.06]  Satan.
[4526.84 --> 4527.72]  There is
[4527.72 --> 4529.20]  no inkwell
[4529.20 --> 4529.56]  of the
[4529.56 --> 4529.86]  spirit.
[4529.92 --> 4531.12]  In this
[4531.12 --> 4531.38]  armor.
[4531.64 --> 4531.92]  It's not
[4531.92 --> 4532.30]  part of
[4532.30 --> 4532.78]  the deal
[4532.78 --> 4534.40]  and Luther
[4534.40 --> 4534.88]  should know
[4534.88 --> 4536.52]  that it's
[4536.52 --> 4536.98]  not against
[4536.98 --> 4537.38]  flesh and
[4537.38 --> 4537.82]  blood so
[4537.82 --> 4538.88]  inkwells
[4538.88 --> 4539.12]  aren't going
[4539.12 --> 4539.26]  to do
[4539.26 --> 4539.66]  the trick.
[4540.50 --> 4541.06]  But what
[4541.06 --> 4541.56]  it does
[4541.56 --> 4542.38]  remind us
[4542.38 --> 4542.88]  of is
[4542.88 --> 4543.54]  that Satan
[4543.54 --> 4544.12]  doesn't
[4544.12 --> 4544.94]  want us
[4544.94 --> 4545.54]  to have
[4545.54 --> 4546.26]  God's
[4546.26 --> 4546.62]  word.
[4547.74 --> 4548.54]  Because it
[4548.54 --> 4549.18]  is the
[4549.18 --> 4549.70]  part of
[4549.70 --> 4550.36]  our armor
[4550.36 --> 4551.22]  that is
[4551.22 --> 4552.00]  most dangerous
[4552.00 --> 4553.22]  to him.
[4554.36 --> 4554.84]  So there's
[4554.84 --> 4555.46]  lots of,
[4555.54 --> 4555.66]  you know,
[4555.70 --> 4555.92]  we're not
[4555.92 --> 4556.22]  going to go
[4556.22 --> 4556.60]  into it
[4556.60 --> 4557.34]  anymore now,
[4557.46 --> 4557.92]  so many
[4557.92 --> 4559.08]  reasons why
[4559.08 --> 4559.74]  we should
[4559.74 --> 4560.52]  read our
[4560.52 --> 4561.02]  Bibles.
[4561.50 --> 4562.00]  But here's
[4562.00 --> 4562.38]  one,
[4563.26 --> 4563.74]  Satan doesn't
[4563.74 --> 4564.04]  want you
[4564.04 --> 4564.22]  to.
[4565.44 --> 4565.74]  How's
[4565.74 --> 4565.92]  that?
[4568.50 --> 4569.16]  So then
[4569.16 --> 4569.36]  you should
[4569.36 --> 4569.62]  say,
[4569.76 --> 4570.28]  I'm going to
[4570.28 --> 4571.26]  read my
[4571.26 --> 4571.58]  Bible.
[4572.74 --> 4572.96]  You know,
[4573.00 --> 4573.46]  make Satan
[4573.46 --> 4574.36]  angry.
[4575.16 --> 4575.24]  Right?
[4575.44 --> 4576.12]  So that's our
[4576.12 --> 4576.76]  armor in the
[4576.76 --> 4577.40]  spiritual struggle.
[4578.28 --> 4578.38]  Right?
[4578.50 --> 4578.96]  Ultimately,
[4579.28 --> 4580.42]  what the armor
[4580.42 --> 4581.04]  is, is a
[4581.04 --> 4582.00]  call to embrace
[4582.00 --> 4582.84]  our life with
[4582.84 --> 4583.64]  God in Jesus
[4583.64 --> 4583.98]  Christ.
[4584.08 --> 4584.52]  That's what the
[4584.52 --> 4585.08]  armor is.
[4585.08 --> 4586.06]  Because it
[4586.06 --> 4586.74]  is only then
[4586.74 --> 4587.12]  that we can
[4587.12 --> 4587.78]  actually fight
[4587.78 --> 4588.50]  against all
[4588.50 --> 4588.98]  these spiritual
[4588.98 --> 4590.00]  forces that
[4590.00 --> 4590.66]  seek to harm
[4590.66 --> 4590.88]  us.
[4591.18 --> 4592.46]  We must put
[4592.46 --> 4592.82]  on this
[4592.82 --> 4593.10]  armor.
[4593.24 --> 4593.64]  We must
[4593.64 --> 4595.04]  stand in
[4595.04 --> 4595.96]  the life of
[4595.96 --> 4596.82]  God in
[4596.82 --> 4597.68]  Christ that
[4597.68 --> 4598.88]  is ours.
[4599.84 --> 4600.66]  Paul warns
[4600.66 --> 4601.16]  us that we
[4601.16 --> 4601.86]  are in a
[4601.86 --> 4602.60]  wrestling match
[4602.60 --> 4604.66]  where every
[4604.66 --> 4605.64]  inch of your
[4605.64 --> 4606.82]  soul is being
[4606.82 --> 4608.04]  explored by
[4608.04 --> 4609.10]  Satan so that
[4609.10 --> 4609.92]  he might find
[4609.92 --> 4610.48]  that point of
[4610.48 --> 4611.28]  weakness and
[4611.28 --> 4612.04]  that he might
[4612.04 --> 4613.92]  leverage it to
[4613.92 --> 4614.74]  put you on
[4614.74 --> 4615.32]  your back.
[4616.36 --> 4617.22]  And honestly,
[4617.58 --> 4618.50]  days of evil
[4618.50 --> 4620.58]  will come when
[4620.58 --> 4621.30]  he will succeed.
[4622.98 --> 4623.82]  There are
[4623.82 --> 4624.72]  moments, there
[4624.72 --> 4625.42]  will be moments
[4625.42 --> 4626.12]  when Satan
[4626.12 --> 4627.04]  will exploit your
[4627.04 --> 4627.54]  weakness and
[4627.54 --> 4628.46]  your sin and
[4628.46 --> 4629.16]  he will flip
[4629.16 --> 4629.36]  you.
[4631.28 --> 4631.94]  And that
[4631.94 --> 4632.52]  leads us,
[4632.60 --> 4633.12]  though, to our
[4633.12 --> 4633.98]  final point,
[4634.18 --> 4635.14]  which is our
[4635.14 --> 4636.32]  hope for
[4636.32 --> 4636.92]  victory.
[4637.28 --> 4637.94]  Our hope for
[4637.94 --> 4638.30]  victory.
[4639.62 --> 4640.08]  See, this
[4640.08 --> 4641.00]  imagery of the
[4641.00 --> 4641.82]  armor of God,
[4642.58 --> 4643.58]  it seems to be
[4643.58 --> 4643.90]  drawn,
[4643.92 --> 4645.00]  directly from
[4645.00 --> 4645.52]  the book of
[4645.52 --> 4645.96]  Isaiah,
[4646.56 --> 4647.70]  Isaiah chapter
[4647.70 --> 4648.24]  59.
[4649.28 --> 4649.96]  And what's so
[4649.96 --> 4650.94]  interesting about
[4650.94 --> 4653.06]  Isaiah is that
[4653.06 --> 4654.78]  the Lord looked
[4654.78 --> 4656.36]  and he saw
[4656.36 --> 4657.32]  that there was
[4657.32 --> 4658.62]  injustice in the
[4658.62 --> 4658.98]  land.
[4659.66 --> 4660.80]  And there was no
[4660.80 --> 4661.56]  one to make it
[4661.56 --> 4661.80]  right.
[4661.88 --> 4662.50]  There was no
[4662.50 --> 4663.40]  earthly savior.
[4664.34 --> 4665.36]  So in Isaiah's
[4665.36 --> 4666.98]  prophecy, do you
[4666.98 --> 4668.04]  know who comes to
[4668.04 --> 4668.96]  actually bring
[4668.96 --> 4669.62]  justice?
[4670.88 --> 4671.88]  The Lord
[4671.88 --> 4673.28]  himself comes.
[4673.28 --> 4674.98]  God sends
[4674.98 --> 4675.80]  his Messiah.
[4676.64 --> 4677.20]  So listen to
[4677.20 --> 4678.50]  Isaiah 59, 17.
[4678.86 --> 4679.42]  See if you
[4679.42 --> 4680.80]  recognize some
[4680.80 --> 4681.38]  of the language
[4681.38 --> 4681.76]  here.
[4682.76 --> 4683.78]  He put on
[4683.78 --> 4685.88]  righteousness as
[4685.88 --> 4686.68]  his breastplate,
[4687.44 --> 4688.50]  the helmet of
[4688.50 --> 4689.84]  salvation on his
[4689.84 --> 4690.18]  head.
[4691.18 --> 4692.40]  He put on the
[4692.40 --> 4693.04]  garments of
[4693.04 --> 4694.12]  vengeance and
[4694.12 --> 4695.18]  wrapped himself in
[4695.18 --> 4696.44]  zeal as in a
[4696.44 --> 4696.86]  cloak.
[4697.92 --> 4698.66]  Right, friends?
[4698.66 --> 4699.74]  Ultimately, our
[4699.74 --> 4700.76]  hope for victory
[4700.76 --> 4701.92]  in the spiritual
[4701.92 --> 4703.42]  battle is because
[4703.42 --> 4705.10]  Jesus came and
[4705.10 --> 4706.52]  he fought this
[4706.52 --> 4707.32]  battle for us.
[4708.06 --> 4708.92]  That's why in
[4708.92 --> 4710.02]  verse 10, Paul
[4710.02 --> 4711.06]  says, be strong
[4711.06 --> 4711.64]  how?
[4712.42 --> 4713.78]  In the Lord.
[4714.26 --> 4715.08]  And in his
[4715.08 --> 4715.80]  mighty power.
[4716.68 --> 4717.44]  This is why our
[4717.44 --> 4718.38]  protection is the
[4718.38 --> 4720.22]  armor of God.
[4721.22 --> 4722.20]  This is why every
[4722.20 --> 4723.18]  part of the armor
[4723.18 --> 4724.04]  is found in
[4724.04 --> 4724.48]  Christ.
[4725.06 --> 4726.44]  It is Christ who
[4726.44 --> 4727.08]  is the truth of
[4727.08 --> 4727.40]  God.
[4727.94 --> 4728.90]  It is Christ who
[4728.90 --> 4729.82]  is our peace.
[4730.26 --> 4731.04]  He has secured
[4731.04 --> 4731.68]  our salvation.
[4732.20 --> 4733.10]  He has wrapped
[4733.10 --> 4733.84]  us in his
[4733.84 --> 4734.30]  righteousness.
[4735.40 --> 4736.12]  This is the
[4736.12 --> 4736.94]  life of Jesus
[4736.94 --> 4738.36]  that is now at
[4738.36 --> 4738.72]  work.
[4739.84 --> 4740.84]  And that's why
[4740.84 --> 4741.78]  Paul says to us
[4741.78 --> 4742.60]  in verse 13,
[4743.24 --> 4744.42]  therefore, put on
[4744.42 --> 4745.26]  the full armor of
[4745.26 --> 4746.14]  God so that when
[4746.14 --> 4746.80]  the day of evil
[4746.80 --> 4747.84]  comes, you may be
[4747.84 --> 4749.74]  able to stand
[4749.74 --> 4751.90]  your ground.
[4753.06 --> 4753.98]  I'll close with
[4753.98 --> 4754.38]  this.
[4755.00 --> 4756.10]  John Bunyan wrote
[4756.10 --> 4756.78]  the Pilgrim's
[4756.78 --> 4757.42]  progress, right?
[4758.22 --> 4759.38]  And in the story,
[4759.60 --> 4760.38]  the main character,
[4760.90 --> 4761.94]  Pilgrim, he
[4761.94 --> 4763.70]  encounters Apollon,
[4764.20 --> 4764.88]  who's really the
[4764.88 --> 4765.14]  devil.
[4765.90 --> 4766.76]  And it says Pilgrim
[4766.76 --> 4767.46]  noticed that he was
[4767.46 --> 4768.62]  not given any armor
[4768.62 --> 4769.88]  for his back.
[4770.70 --> 4772.74]  Nothing to cover and
[4772.74 --> 4773.70]  protect his back.
[4774.56 --> 4775.52]  And so he says, he
[4775.52 --> 4777.54]  reasoned that it
[4777.54 --> 4778.36]  would be safest,
[4779.16 --> 4779.46]  how?
[4779.46 --> 4780.56]  He's going to be a
[4780.56 --> 4780.72]  devil.
[4780.72 --> 4781.84]  He's going to be a
[4781.84 --> 4781.88]  devil.
[4781.88 --> 4782.90]  By standing fast.
[4783.68 --> 4785.10]  Not turning and
[4785.10 --> 4786.68]  running away, but
[4786.68 --> 4787.98]  standing his ground
[4787.98 --> 4790.54]  and trusting in his
[4790.54 --> 4790.82]  armor.
[4791.78 --> 4793.78]  If you've put on the
[4793.78 --> 4795.08]  whole armor of God,
[4795.22 --> 4797.02]  you will be able to
[4797.02 --> 4798.62]  stand against the
[4798.62 --> 4799.68]  devil in his schemes.
[4800.62 --> 4802.04]  If you trust in God,
[4802.16 --> 4803.38]  if you stand fast,
[4803.58 --> 4804.68]  not running away,
[4804.68 --> 4807.36]  but trusting in what
[4807.36 --> 4808.46]  you have been given,
[4809.06 --> 4810.66]  we have God's
[4810.66 --> 4811.84]  promise that we
[4811.84 --> 4813.14]  will stand fast.
[4813.48 --> 4814.36]  Because ultimately,
[4814.54 --> 4815.40]  we do not stand in
[4815.40 --> 4816.48]  our own strength,
[4816.86 --> 4818.86]  but in the strength
[4818.86 --> 4819.86]  of the Lord.
[4821.16 --> 4821.88]  And so this morning,
[4821.96 --> 4822.38]  brothers and
[4822.38 --> 4822.70]  sisters,
[4823.90 --> 4824.68]  put on
[4825.28 --> 4826.78]  the full
[4826.78 --> 4828.36]  armor of God.
[4829.16 --> 4829.68]  Be strong
[4830.30 --> 4831.06]  in him.
[4831.94 --> 4833.06]  Take courage
[4833.06 --> 4835.22]  because we are
[4835.22 --> 4836.74]  more than
[4836.74 --> 4837.40]  conquerors,
[4837.48 --> 4837.94]  Paul says,
[4838.00 --> 4838.62]  through him who
[4838.62 --> 4839.22]  loved us.
[4839.48 --> 4840.36]  That nothing in all
[4840.36 --> 4841.66]  of creation can
[4841.66 --> 4843.06]  ever separate us
[4843.06 --> 4844.80]  from the love of
[4844.80 --> 4846.22]  God that is in
[4846.22 --> 4847.04]  Christ Jesus,
[4847.26 --> 4847.72]  our Lord.
[4848.50 --> 4849.56]  Please pray with me.
[4854.12 --> 4855.34]  Our Heavenly Father,
[4855.46 --> 4856.94]  we thank you that
[4856.94 --> 4857.98]  you have not left
[4857.98 --> 4859.82]  us unequipped.
[4860.44 --> 4861.42]  You have not left
[4861.42 --> 4862.70]  us vulnerable,
[4863.06 --> 4864.52]  or to ourselves,
[4865.14 --> 4866.20]  but you have
[4866.20 --> 4867.68]  clothed us.
[4868.22 --> 4868.90]  You have
[4868.90 --> 4870.60]  taken your
[4870.60 --> 4871.04]  armor,
[4871.26 --> 4871.94]  your righteousness,
[4872.18 --> 4872.88]  your peace,
[4873.20 --> 4873.94]  your salvation,
[4873.94 --> 4874.68]  and you have
[4874.68 --> 4875.62]  donned it upon
[4875.62 --> 4876.06]  us.
[4876.64 --> 4877.82]  We are protected.
[4878.76 --> 4879.54]  Nothing can
[4879.54 --> 4880.68]  ultimately harm us.
[4881.80 --> 4882.46]  But Lord,
[4882.52 --> 4883.50]  we must put this
[4883.50 --> 4884.04]  life on.
[4884.14 --> 4885.26]  We must dwell
[4885.26 --> 4885.94]  in our life with
[4885.94 --> 4886.34]  Christ.
[4886.82 --> 4887.80]  In every way,
[4887.92 --> 4888.58]  Lord, and if we do,
[4888.66 --> 4889.24]  we are protected.
[4889.68 --> 4890.08]  So Lord,
[4890.14 --> 4890.62]  help us.
[4890.62 --> 4892.64]  we know because
[4892.64 --> 4893.18]  of our sin,
[4893.24 --> 4893.94]  we are vulnerable.
[4895.02 --> 4895.88]  Because of our sin,
[4895.96 --> 4897.34]  Satan can accuse us.
[4897.56 --> 4898.70]  He can cause us
[4898.70 --> 4899.36]  to despair.
[4900.72 --> 4901.08]  And Lord,
[4901.16 --> 4902.02]  in those moments,
[4902.70 --> 4903.56]  would you help us
[4903.56 --> 4904.88]  to stand fast
[4904.88 --> 4906.82]  in the truth
[4906.82 --> 4907.70]  of who you are
[4907.70 --> 4908.32]  and who you have
[4908.32 --> 4909.06]  made us to be.
[4909.52 --> 4910.72]  We pray in Jesus'
[4910.94 --> 4911.14]  name.
[4911.78 --> 4912.02]  Amen.
[4912.02 --> 4914.98]  All right.
[4915.18 --> 4916.28]  So please stand.
[4916.58 --> 4917.72]  We'll sing our
[4917.72 --> 4918.88]  song of response
[4918.88 --> 4919.20]  together.
[4924.36 --> 4925.50]  God is for us.
[4925.58 --> 4926.54]  We won't fear the
[4926.54 --> 4926.80]  battle.
[4926.80 --> 4948.30]  We will fear the battle, we will fear the night.
[4948.30 --> 4953.14]  They will walk the valley with you by our side.
[4953.14 --> 4957.96]  You will go before us, you will lead the way.
[4958.46 --> 4963.04]  We have found a refuge, only you can stay.
[4964.62 --> 4970.46]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[4970.86 --> 4974.98]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[4974.98 --> 4979.70]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[4979.70 --> 4984.96]  Who can stand against us, our God is for us.
[4984.96 --> 5002.88]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall, even when I turn back, still your love is sure.
[5002.88 --> 5007.72]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake.
[5008.30 --> 5013.70]  You will cheer me onward in never-ending grace.
[5016.52 --> 5021.32]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[5021.32 --> 5025.86]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[5026.24 --> 5030.46]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[5030.98 --> 5035.78]  Who can stand against us, our God is for us.
[5035.78 --> 5049.30]  Neither night nor death can separate us.
[5049.30 --> 5054.00]  Hell and air, the mighty feed us.
[5054.24 --> 5062.66]  He who gave his Son to free us, holds me in his love.
[5062.66 --> 5089.22]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[5089.22 --> 5093.74]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[5094.06 --> 5098.14]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[5098.64 --> 5103.18]  Who can stand against us, our God is for us.
[5103.18 --> 5107.68]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us.
[5108.06 --> 5111.90]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[5112.42 --> 5116.54]  Raise your voice now, the love is greater.
[5116.54 --> 5121.96]  Who can stand against us, our God is for us.
[5121.96 --> 5141.16]  We worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings.
[5141.16 --> 5145.82]  Psalm 111 verse 1 says this,
[5146.24 --> 5148.84]  Let us give thanks to the Lord with all of our being.
[5149.48 --> 5155.86]  In the company of the upright, let us honor God for the blessings and goodness we have received.
[5157.00 --> 5160.86]  And so let us be faithful stewards of our time, our talents, and our money,
[5161.12 --> 5164.56]  so that our treasure is in heaven and our giving pleases God.
[5164.56 --> 5170.64]  Our offering today is for Reframe Ministries, and that's our designated offering.
[5171.16 --> 5174.76]  So may I ask the deacons to come forward to collect the offering.

[5263.72 --> 5265.72]  Amen.
[5283.72 --> 5286.70]  Let's pray together as God's people.
[5287.60 --> 5288.56]  Please pray with me.
[5288.56 --> 5293.88]  Lord, it's with humble hearts that we bow before you this morning.
[5295.20 --> 5301.38]  Father, we are in awe of your power and of your provision for us.
[5301.78 --> 5302.76]  God, you reign.
[5303.88 --> 5307.20]  Your goodness goes forth throughout all of the earth.
[5308.42 --> 5317.66]  Lord, you have conquered sin and death and the devil through the cross, your death, your resurrection, your ascension at God's right hand.
[5317.66 --> 5324.08]  And you are over all, all of the rulers, powers, and authorities.
[5325.94 --> 5332.60]  So, Father, we thank you for Jesus, the life that we have with God in him.
[5333.60 --> 5338.30]  We thank you for the privilege of gathering today together as one family in Christ.
[5338.30 --> 5340.54]  This is something we often take for granted.
[5341.20 --> 5345.00]  But we realize that this, too, is a gift from you.
[5346.08 --> 5347.94]  And we thank you, Lord, for the changing season.
[5348.10 --> 5352.80]  We see your wonderful and marvelous handiwork in nature all around us.
[5352.80 --> 5359.40]  And it is evidence of your almighty power, your unmatched creativity.
[5360.12 --> 5371.26]  But, Lord, with the coming of winter often also comes flu season, maybe an increase of cases of COVID and other illnesses, Lord.
[5371.36 --> 5375.78]  So we pray for all the hospital staff and health care workers in our city.
[5375.78 --> 5380.02]  They have been overwhelmed by many people needing care.
[5380.78 --> 5386.00]  So, Father, would you give your help to alleviate their troubles in the way that you know best.
[5386.72 --> 5391.44]  We pray that you would provide them with encouragement and empathy to carry on in their work.
[5394.10 --> 5400.50]  Father, we continue to pray for those who are suffering from the war in Ukraine and other locations around the world.
[5400.50 --> 5406.78]  We pray for refugees that continue to come to Canada in hopes of finding safety.
[5407.72 --> 5413.04]  And would they, Lord, find not only safety and welcome, but most of all, Lord, would you find them.
[5414.74 --> 5418.90]  We continue to lift before you the ministries of our church.
[5419.40 --> 5421.52]  We're in our small groups that are starting up.
[5422.36 --> 5429.58]  Our Sunday school ministry, GEMS and Cadets, Friendship Coffeehouse, ESL, Cross Training.
[5429.58 --> 5432.00]  Our Chinese outreach ministry.
[5432.72 --> 5435.42]  Lord, we pray for the leadership of each ministry.
[5435.96 --> 5438.34]  We pray for help where help is needed.
[5438.94 --> 5444.82]  And we pray that each ministry would be a community that seeks to grow in you and with each other.
[5446.86 --> 5452.72]  Lord, as we think about the specific needs of our own community, first, we thank you for hearing our prayers.
[5453.48 --> 5458.22]  We've been praying for Fauu, for her surgery.
[5458.22 --> 5464.64]  And, Lord, we thank you that she has come out of the hospital, that it was a successful surgery, and that she is back at home resting.
[5464.86 --> 5466.48]  Lord, would you give her full recovery.
[5467.34 --> 5474.06]  Lord, would you heal her completely, that she soon would be able to join us in person together to worship you.
[5474.06 --> 5484.32]  Father, we also now pray for Pastor Nancy, who has received a diagnosis of cancer.
[5485.54 --> 5492.54]  And, Lord, she shared with me that she would hope that this could be a time of prayer,
[5492.54 --> 5500.16]  where we could look to you and, Lord, ask you to do something miraculous in her.
[5500.46 --> 5506.80]  Lord, we thank you, Lord, that there's good prognosis for her surgery in January.
[5507.02 --> 5510.92]  Lord, we ask that it would go well, that the surgery would remove all the cancer.
[5511.98 --> 5513.16]  But, Lord, would you be with her.
[5513.28 --> 5514.02]  Come for her spirit.
[5514.72 --> 5517.92]  Come for all of us, Lord, as we seek to walk with her.
[5517.92 --> 5523.54]  And, Lord, there are many other struggles that we have.
[5524.36 --> 5529.60]  We thank you, Lord, most of all, that you know them all, that you know each one of us.
[5529.70 --> 5533.36]  You know the things that are on our minds and that weigh heavily on our hearts.
[5534.22 --> 5541.62]  And, Lord, we thank you for the armor of God that we can put on, of faith and peace and righteousness and salvation,
[5541.62 --> 5546.30]  knowing that you reign and that you will rule over all things.
[5546.46 --> 5548.50]  So, Lord, make us mindful of your mercies.
[5549.36 --> 5552.00]  Help us to be ready to serve you with all of our hearts.
[5552.36 --> 5556.40]  We pray all this in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ.
[5557.08 --> 5557.38]  Amen.
[5559.00 --> 5559.90]  Friends, please stand.
[5561.58 --> 5564.48]  And as we go, we go with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5564.54 --> 5567.42]  And, again, join us for lunch right in the fellowship hall.
[5568.08 --> 5569.46]  Try out all the different soups.
[5569.54 --> 5570.28]  I'm looking forward to it.
[5570.28 --> 5574.34]  So, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5575.44 --> 5578.10]  The love of the Father surround you.
[5578.98 --> 5581.00]  The grace of Christ attend you.
[5581.74 --> 5585.50]  And the Holy Spirit keep you, both now and forever.
[5586.28 --> 5586.52]  Amen.
[5586.52 --> 5586.62]  Amen.

[5656.96 --> 5661.96]  And in the knowledge of the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5661.96 --> 5668.66]  My friends, may you grow in grace.
[5668.66 --> 5669.66]  May you grow in grace.
[5669.66 --> 5673.66]  And in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5673.66 --> 5674.66]  And in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5674.66 --> 5679.66]  To God be the glory, now and forever.
