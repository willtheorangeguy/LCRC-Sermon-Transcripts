[0.00 --> 10.20]  норм?..
[10.20 --> 11.20]  Amen.
[40.20 --> 42.20]  Amen.
[70.20 --> 72.20]  Amen.
[100.20 --> 102.20]  Amen.
[130.20 --> 132.20]  Amen.
[160.20 --> 162.20]  Amen.
[190.20 --> 192.20]  Amen.
[220.20 --> 222.20]  Amen.
[250.20 --> 253.20]  Well, good morning.
[253.20 --> 254.20]  Good morning.
[254.20 --> 257.20]  And welcome to Latin American Christian Reformed Church.
[257.20 --> 261.20]  And of course, a special welcome if you're here visiting with us today.
[261.20 --> 266.20]  We're certainly blessed by your presence here and pray that we in turn can be a blessing to you.
[266.20 --> 269.20]  A few announcements before we begin the service.
[269.20 --> 279.20]  First is if you read last week's bulletin, you would have seen that Mark Glanville, a press professor at Regent College, was scheduled to preach with us today, be our guest pastor.
[279.20 --> 283.20]  But we found out just on Friday that he's got COVID.
[283.20 --> 286.20]  So, yeah, he's feeling okay, he says.
[286.20 --> 289.20]  He actually even offered to preach remotely.
[289.20 --> 294.20]  But fortunately, I think Pastor Jason, on very short notice, agreed to step in.
[294.20 --> 297.20]  So he will be bringing God's word to us this morning.
[297.20 --> 299.20]  I think that's a good call.
[299.20 --> 304.20]  Also, out in the lobby on the table, you'll see some Easter invitations.
[304.20 --> 305.20]  They're pretty small.
[305.20 --> 307.20]  But look for them.
[307.20 --> 311.20]  Good Friday's not that far away, less than two weeks now.
[311.20 --> 315.20]  And these are available if you have neighbours, friends that you'd like to invite to that service.
[315.20 --> 319.20]  Please take one or more and hand those out.
[319.20 --> 326.20]  And, yeah, of course, this week's been tough for the congregation.
[326.20 --> 329.20]  On Monday, we said goodbye to Joan Bauman.
[329.20 --> 331.20]  And on Tuesday, Hank Nyman.
[331.20 --> 333.20]  So those are sad things.
[333.20 --> 339.20]  And, of course, we've got memorial services coming up on April 12th, next Tuesday, for Joan.
[339.20 --> 342.20]  And this coming Friday for Hank.
[342.20 --> 349.20]  As well as on the 9th, the long delayed service for Tim Bantall will be held as well.
[349.20 --> 356.20]  So, busy week for services and an opportunity to celebrate lives well lived, of course.
[356.20 --> 361.20]  And, of course, God calls us to worship him this morning.
[361.20 --> 368.20]  And he invites us into his healing presence with these words based from Exodus 15 and Isaiah 6.
[368.20 --> 371.20]  I am the Lord who heals you.
[371.20 --> 379.20]  Diseased, depressed, dysfunctional, defeated, we come hungering for health that only God can provide.
[379.20 --> 388.20]  God calls us to bring open eyes, hearing ears, and tender hearts turned towards him, the great physician.
[388.20 --> 392.20]  Let us bow before him in faith and expectancy.
[392.20 --> 401.20]  Now that God has greeted us, let's take a moment to stand up, let's greet each other, and then the Praise Team will lead us in three songs.
[422.20 --> 433.20]  The Acho花 junto� has検оль and ibadved us.
[433.20 --> 447.44]  And the bodisions of the Deviantron will be held as
[447.44 --> 463.24]  He wants himself in light, and darkness tries to hide, and trembles at his voice, and trembles at his voice.
[463.24 --> 482.52]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will see how great, how great is our God.
[482.52 --> 499.98]  From age to age he stands, and time is in his hands, beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
[499.98 --> 515.90]  Then God are three in one, all the spirits of the lion and the lamb, the lion and the lamb.
[515.90 --> 534.90]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will see how great, how great is our God.
[534.90 --> 556.58]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, our heart will sing, how great is our God.
[556.58 --> 576.58]  Name above all names, worthy of all praise, our heart will sing, how great is our God.
[576.58 --> 596.64]  How great is our God, sing with me, how great is our God, and all will see how great, how great is our God.
[606.58 --> 616.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[616.58 --> 618.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[618.58 --> 628.58]  Stronger, His mercy is born.
[628.58 --> 630.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[630.58 --> 638.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[638.58 --> 645.58]  Stronger, God bless you every more.
[645.58 --> 651.58]  Our sins they are many, His mercy is born.
[651.58 --> 658.58]  What love could remember, what love could remember, no wrongs we have done.
[658.58 --> 664.58]  Our nation, all knowing, He counts not as son.
[664.58 --> 671.58]  He's thrown into a sea with the power of our shore.
[671.58 --> 678.58]  Our sins they are many, His mercy is born.
[678.58 --> 680.58]  We know, His mercy is born.
[680.58 --> 685.58]  Our sins they are many, His mercy is born.
[685.58 --> 693.58]  What patience would wait as we constantly roam.
[693.58 --> 698.58]  Our Father, so tender, is calling us home.
[698.58 --> 705.58]  He welcomes the weakest, the wildest, the poor.
[705.58 --> 712.58]  Now the sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[713.52 --> 722.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[725.52 --> 730.46]  Stronger and darkness to every road,
[730.46 --> 735.78]  Now the sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[735.98 --> 743.70]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[747.44 --> 752.28]  Stronger and darkness to every road,
[752.70 --> 758.46]  Now the sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[758.46 --> 764.80]  The riches of kindness He lavished on us,
[765.16 --> 770.36]  His man was the payment, His life was the past,
[770.72 --> 775.98]  We stood with the debt we could never afford,
[777.34 --> 782.88]  Our sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[782.88 --> 791.58]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[791.58 --> 799.92]  Stronger and darkness to every road,
[799.92 --> 805.06]  Now the sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[805.06 --> 812.74]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is born.
[812.74 --> 821.08]  Stronger and darkness to every road,
[821.08 --> 826.74]  Now the sins they are made, His mercy is born.
[826.74 --> 837.48]  Stronger and darkness to every road,
[837.48 --> 840.66]  New color, the sin they are made,
[840.66 --> 841.02]  Now the sins they are made,
[841.02 --> 841.80] ம GRAD within tego are made,
[841.80 --> 842.70]  New Gangster Water,

[844.40 --> 845.02]  New Señor,
[845.02 --> 846.30]  New thought that only You are made,
[846.30 --> 847.44]  Newadersそれizaciónutor Alice,

[849.00 --> 849.64]  New sight of water,
[849.64 --> 854.54]  Newúblico,
[854.54 --> 871.48]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[871.48 --> 886.24]  My source was lost, and now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[886.24 --> 902.38]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[902.38 --> 918.38]  How precious did that grace appear, the how I first believed.
[918.38 --> 935.38]  The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures.
[935.38 --> 952.24]  He will my still and portion be, as long as life endures.
[952.24 --> 968.24]  Through many dangers, doors, and signs, I have always become.
[968.24 --> 985.24]  T'was grace that God may save the time, and grace will lead me home.
[985.24 --> 1001.24]  When we've been left ten thousand years, Christ had in us the sun.
[1001.24 --> 1016.20]  We've no less days to see in those ways, than when we've first begun.
[1016.20 --> 1035.84]  At this time, if you're age three through grade seven, you are able to leave for kids' life.
[1046.20 --> 1062.20]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1067.20 --> 1073.84]  Almighty and merciful God, we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.
[1073.84 --> 1078.84]  We have followed too much the vices and desires of our own hearts.
[1078.84 --> 1081.84]  We have offended against your holy laws.
[1082.84 --> 1085.84]  We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,
[1085.84 --> 1089.84]  and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.
[1090.84 --> 1092.84]  O Lord, have mercy upon us.
[1093.84 --> 1095.84]  Spare those who confess their faults.
[1096.84 --> 1102.84]  Restore those who are penitent according to your promises declared to the world in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1103.84 --> 1112.84]  And grant, O merciful God, for his sake, that we may live a holy, just, and humble life to the glory of your holy name.
[1112.84 --> 1113.84]  Amen.
[1113.84 --> 1122.84]  Of course, the beautiful part in the heart of the gospel is the promise of salvation through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[1122.84 --> 1126.84]  And we are reminded of that this morning with these words from 1 John.
[1126.84 --> 1135.84]  This is a message we have heard from God and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in God there is no darkness at all.
[1136.84 --> 1146.84]  If we walk in the light, as God is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
[1146.84 --> 1148.84]  Let's sing, I lift my eyes up.
[1148.84 --> 1153.84]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1153.84 --> 1165.84]  Where does my help come from?
[1165.84 --> 1166.84]  My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1166.84 --> 1167.84]  Oh, how I am, I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1167.84 --> 1172.84]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1172.84 --> 1177.84]  Where does my help come from?
[1177.84 --> 1192.84]  My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1192.84 --> 1197.84]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1197.84 --> 1201.84]  You are my only hope.
[1201.84 --> 1207.84]  You're my only friend.
[1207.84 --> 1214.84]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[1214.84 --> 1220.84]  Come and give me life.
[1220.84 --> 1227.84]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1227.84 --> 1233.84]  Where does my help come from?
[1233.84 --> 1248.84]  My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[1248.84 --> 1249.84]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1249.84 --> 1252.84]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[1252.84 --> 1255.84]  You are my only hope.
[1255.84 --> 1261.84]  You're my only friend.
[1261.84 --> 1266.84]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[1266.84 --> 1271.84]  Come and give me life.
[1271.84 --> 1281.84]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1281.84 --> 1286.84]  Where does my help come from?
[1286.84 --> 1301.84]  I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[1301.84 --> 1302.84]  Good morning.
[1302.84 --> 1303.84]  Good morning.
[1303.84 --> 1309.84]  Yes, so I had booked Mark of Glanville way back last December, because I know he's a busy guy.
[1309.84 --> 1313.84]  So he said, okay, I'm going to put it on my calendar.
[1313.84 --> 1316.84]  And, you know, I even, he used to preach at Willoughby.
[1316.84 --> 1320.84]  And so I did go and listen to his sermon, see what we're getting ourselves into.
[1320.84 --> 1321.84]  He's very good.
[1321.84 --> 1325.84]  So he said, I'll come back in the future.
[1325.84 --> 1330.84]  And so we will, I do hope we can invite him again.
[1330.84 --> 1336.84]  He was the supervisor for my THM thesis at Regent.
[1336.84 --> 1338.84]  So that's why I connected with him.
[1338.84 --> 1342.84]  And also he just wrote a book about refugee ministry, which is excellent.
[1342.84 --> 1356.84]  So anyway, so instead of having a special sermon on refugees and the call of God to care for refugees, we might do that in the future.
[1356.84 --> 1361.84]  But today we're going to continue in our series for the season of Lent.
[1361.84 --> 1363.84]  This is the fifth Sunday of the church season of Lent.
[1363.84 --> 1375.84]  You know, and as we've said, it's the season when the church around the world focuses our attentions on the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1375.84 --> 1382.84]  And so in order to help us to do this in our own church, that we as a church might focus on the suffering and death of Jesus,
[1382.84 --> 1386.84]  we're in the sermon series called The Seven Last Words.
[1386.84 --> 1396.84]  And where we're looking at the seven last statements, the words of Jesus from the cross as he is hanging on the cross.
[1396.84 --> 1405.84]  And each week as we listen to Jesus speak from the cross, our hope is that we might hear the heart of Christ.
[1405.84 --> 1407.84]  To hear the heart of Christ.
[1407.84 --> 1411.84]  So that we therefore would hear and then know his great love for us.
[1411.84 --> 1416.84]  The reason he is on the cross is because of his love for us.
[1416.84 --> 1420.84]  But not only that, we also want to gain the heart of Christ ourselves.
[1420.84 --> 1425.84]  We want to hear it, but then we want to become more like our Lord.
[1425.84 --> 1436.84]  And so today, very near the end of his suffering, Jesus speaks and he says, I am thirsty.
[1436.84 --> 1441.84]  So with that, let's, I forgot to read the passage.
[1441.84 --> 1442.84]  Who's reading?
[1442.84 --> 1443.84]  Thank you, Lindsay.
[1443.84 --> 1447.84]  We'll have Lindsay come up and we'll read the passage for today.
[1447.84 --> 1462.84]  Our scripture reading this morning is from John 19, verse 28 to 29.
[1462.84 --> 1472.84]  Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, I am thirsty.
[1472.84 --> 1482.84]  A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus's lips.
[1482.84 --> 1485.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1485.84 --> 1487.84]  Thanks be to God.
[1487.84 --> 1492.84]  All right.
[1492.84 --> 1497.84]  Would you please join me in a word of prayer?
[1497.84 --> 1502.84]  Our Heavenly Father, we come before you.
[1502.84 --> 1503.84]  We come before you.
[1503.84 --> 1507.84]  We come before the mystery of the cross.
[1507.84 --> 1519.84]  Father, we come wanting to hear the heart of Christ, our Lord, to hear what he thinks about us, to hear his love and his care for us in the midst of our own sufferings in this world.
[1519.84 --> 1531.84]  So, Lord, as we come, would you open our hearts and our minds that we might listen and hear and know the love of Christ for us through the work of the Holy Spirit that is within us.
[1531.84 --> 1533.84]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1533.84 --> 1538.84]  So, Jesus speaks and he says, I am thirsty.
[1538.84 --> 1544.84]  You know, one of the first signs of life is thirst.
[1544.84 --> 1546.84]  We are all born thirsty.
[1546.84 --> 1552.84]  And if you are a mom here this morning, you know this to be incredibly true.
[1552.84 --> 1554.84]  Babies are thirsty little creatures.
[1554.84 --> 1563.84]  You know, they are constantly wanting to go to the source of life, which is their mothers for the nourishment.
[1563.84 --> 1565.84]  That they need.
[1565.84 --> 1568.84]  But that thirst is continual, isn't it?
[1568.84 --> 1571.84]  It extends throughout all of life.
[1571.84 --> 1574.84]  Without water, we would die quickly.
[1574.84 --> 1583.84]  My kids like to remind me and think about this, that we can go 40 days without food, but we can only go two or three days max without water.
[1583.84 --> 1588.84]  I'm not sure what they're planning, but they want to have this figured out.
[1588.84 --> 1594.84]  In our passage this morning, then, though, it's not a cry from a child.
[1594.84 --> 1598.84]  It's not our own thirst that is being spoken of.
[1598.84 --> 1602.84]  It's the cry of Jesus as he is dying on the cross.
[1602.84 --> 1609.84]  So today we think about the physical suffering of Jesus on the cross.
[1609.84 --> 1612.84]  His physical suffering.
[1612.84 --> 1614.84]  Think about this.
[1614.84 --> 1619.84]  The most high God became human.
[1619.84 --> 1627.84]  That God would become physical in the same way that we are physical is absolutely scandalous.
[1627.84 --> 1634.84]  So much about having a body seems beneath his dignity.
[1634.84 --> 1635.84]  Right?
[1635.84 --> 1642.84]  Like all of us, Jesus sweated, he sneezed, and he scratched.
[1642.84 --> 1645.84]  Islam will not accept this.
[1645.84 --> 1650.84]  And their lack of acceptance is their way of trying to protect God's honor.
[1650.84 --> 1657.84]  The idea of God participating in our humanity brings up too many awkward questions.
[1657.84 --> 1666.84]  You know, a father, I've heard this story, a father once put the question and answer call and response format of the catechism to good work.
[1666.84 --> 1672.84]  From the back seat of his minivan, his three-year-old daughter asked this question,
[1672.84 --> 1675.84]  Dad, does God have a nose?
[1675.84 --> 1678.84]  What a great question.
[1678.84 --> 1680.84]  A budding theologian.
[1680.84 --> 1681.84]  How would you answer?
[1681.84 --> 1683.84]  Does God have a nose?
[1683.84 --> 1690.84]  Well, so rather than just answer her straight, he replied with a question from the children's catechism.
[1690.84 --> 1693.84]  He asked, well, Annie, what is God?
[1693.84 --> 1698.84]  And Annie replied immediately, God is a spirit and has not a body like men.
[1698.84 --> 1702.84]  And so the dad asked, so then, does God have a nose?
[1702.84 --> 1704.84]  And Annie replied happily, no.
[1704.84 --> 1705.84]  No.
[1705.84 --> 1707.84]  And that is true.
[1707.84 --> 1710.84]  God the Father does not have a body.
[1710.84 --> 1716.84]  But friends, today we have this shocking truth that God now has a nose.
[1716.84 --> 1719.84]  Because Jesus Christ has a nose.
[1719.84 --> 1720.84]  Right?
[1720.84 --> 1723.84]  God the Son became incarnate.
[1723.84 --> 1729.84]  As John writes in chapter one of the Gospel, the same author wrote the passage we read.
[1729.84 --> 1736.84]  He says, the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[1736.84 --> 1745.84]  Jesus, the Word of God through whom all things were made, now participates in what he has made.
[1745.84 --> 1752.84]  He came and he entered into the physical reality.
[1752.84 --> 1757.84]  And so Jesus is not less physical than you are.
[1757.84 --> 1764.84]  He is not more physical than you are, though he is now resurrected as you one day will be.
[1764.84 --> 1770.84]  And Jesus ascended bodily into heaven where he remains embodied even today.
[1770.84 --> 1773.84]  And always shall.
[1773.84 --> 1775.84]  Jesus was born as a little boy.
[1775.84 --> 1780.84]  He grew and developed like little boys do to become men.
[1780.84 --> 1786.84]  He had to eat to nourish his body, just like you and I do.
[1786.84 --> 1790.84]  He had to sleep to refresh himself, just like you and I do.
[1790.84 --> 1795.84]  He had to study to learn to read, just like we do.
[1795.84 --> 1800.84]  He had to be careful not to drink too much wine, just like you.
[1800.84 --> 1805.84]  He had to be careful how he looked at a woman, just like you.
[1805.84 --> 1810.84]  But though he was tempted in every way, as we are, yet he did not sin.
[1810.84 --> 1814.84]  He was holy and blameless and pure, always.
[1814.84 --> 1822.84]  But because he was a true man on the cross, the nails through his wrists and through his ankles hurt.
[1822.84 --> 1824.84]  They hurt like crazy.
[1824.84 --> 1828.84]  He had trouble breathing and after six hours hanging on the cross, he said,
[1828.84 --> 1831.84]  I am thirsty.
[1831.84 --> 1833.84]  Of course he was.
[1833.84 --> 1837.84]  Jesus had been beaten and he was bleeding.
[1837.84 --> 1839.84]  He had lost a lot of blood.
[1839.84 --> 1844.84]  He was desperately dehydrated from so much loss of blood.
[1844.84 --> 1850.84]  And he was hanging on the cross under the near eastern sun in the heat of the day.
[1850.84 --> 1855.84]  Thirst was one of the main features of the torture of crucifixion.
[1855.84 --> 1860.84]  So Jesus Christ suffered spiritual abandonment.
[1860.84 --> 1865.84]  Remember last week we talked about how he cried out, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[1865.84 --> 1874.84]  But he also suffered physically because he participated in our humanity bodily.
[1874.84 --> 1876.84]  Now why did he do this?
[1876.84 --> 1877.84]  Right?
[1877.84 --> 1880.84]  Why did he become physical?
[1880.84 --> 1884.84]  Why did he stoop so low?
[1884.84 --> 1890.84]  Well, here's how that very question is answered in Hebrews chapter 2.
[1890.84 --> 1891.84]  So let's look there.
[1891.84 --> 1892.84]  Here.
[1892.84 --> 1901.84]  Since the children, that is us, have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity.
[1901.84 --> 1906.84]  For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.
[1906.84 --> 1918.84]  For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God.
[1918.84 --> 1923.84]  And that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
[1923.84 --> 1926.84]  See, Jesus shared in our humanity.
[1926.84 --> 1928.84]  He became like us in every single way.
[1928.84 --> 1931.84]  He did not become like the angels.
[1931.84 --> 1933.84]  He became like us.
[1933.84 --> 1935.84]  And he did it for our sake.
[1935.84 --> 1940.84]  He did it to become our faithful and merciful high priest.
[1940.84 --> 1947.84]  He did it to protect us from the destruction that we deserve because of our sin.
[1947.84 --> 1953.84]  And on the cross, Jesus, our high priest, fulfills the Passover.
[1953.84 --> 1962.84]  There's a textual clue here in what John writes that I believe tells us that this is what John had in mind.
[1962.84 --> 1972.84]  So let me show you in Luke, sorry, John, verse 29, in our chapter, chapter 19, verse 29, this is what he writes.
[1972.84 --> 1975.84]  A jar of wine vinegar was there.
[1975.84 --> 1985.84]  So they, the soldiers, soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
[1985.84 --> 1990.84]  Okay, so the soldiers used a sponge to soak up some of their wine vinegar.
[1990.84 --> 1991.84]  This is their drink.
[1991.84 --> 1993.84]  The wine vinegar is like cheap wine.
[1993.84 --> 1997.84]  It's the ordinary drink of the people, inexpensive.
[1997.84 --> 2002.84]  And then what did they put the sponge on?
[2002.84 --> 2004.84]  A hyssop plant.
[2004.84 --> 2010.84]  Now let's flash back to the Passover, when God delivered his people out of slavery in Egypt.
[2010.84 --> 2023.84]  That was the awful night when the people of God were protected from the destruction that roamed Egypt, killing the firstborn of every household.
[2023.84 --> 2028.84]  So let me read to you from Exodus, chapter 12.
[2028.84 --> 2033.84]  Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them,
[2033.84 --> 2039.84]  Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
[2039.84 --> 2050.84]  Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe.
[2050.84 --> 2055.84]  None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.
[2055.84 --> 2062.84]  When the Lord goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe.
[2062.84 --> 2071.84]  He will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
[2071.84 --> 2078.84]  One of the things that strikes me about this story is how physical it is.
[2078.84 --> 2082.84]  Right? Just how embodied it is.
[2082.84 --> 2086.84]  The people of Israel believed the warning.
[2086.84 --> 2093.84]  They were not protected by their motivations.
[2093.84 --> 2096.84]  They were not protected by their sins.
[2096.84 --> 2099.84]  And they did just as Moses and Aaron had said.
[2099.84 --> 2101.84]  They slaughtered lambs.
[2101.84 --> 2103.84]  They gathered hyssop branches.
[2103.84 --> 2108.84]  If they had went outside, they too would have been struck down.
[2108.84 --> 2114.84]  So, they were not protected by their motivations.
[2114.84 --> 2120.84]  They were not protected by their ideas about who God is.
[2120.84 --> 2123.84]  They were not protected by their good lives.
[2123.84 --> 2128.84]  They were not protected by their heritage as offspring of Abraham.
[2128.84 --> 2133.84]  What protected them from destruction?
[2133.84 --> 2135.84]  The blood.
[2135.84 --> 2138.84]  The blood of the Passover lamb.
[2138.84 --> 2146.84]  And their faith made them believe, and they put the blood on the doorposts.
[2146.84 --> 2151.84]  God's grace in this story is embodied.
[2151.84 --> 2157.84]  The slain lamb, the blood dripping from the door.
[2157.84 --> 2162.84]  Because you see here, Jesus Christ is the real Passover lamb.
[2162.84 --> 2165.84]  John tells us that this is part of Jesus' identity.
[2165.84 --> 2167.84]  He tells us right at the beginning of the Gospel.
[2167.84 --> 2171.84]  To remember, what did John the Baptist say when he saw Jesus?
[2171.84 --> 2173.84]  John saw Jesus coming toward him and said,
[2173.84 --> 2178.84]  Look, the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[2178.84 --> 2183.84]  Friends, we need Jesus to be a great many things for us.
[2183.84 --> 2190.84]  But we certainly need him to be the physical sacrifice for sin.
[2190.84 --> 2195.84]  We need him to be the Passover lamb who was slain.
[2195.84 --> 2202.84]  Each week, we use these last words from the cross to help us to hear the heart of Christ.
[2202.84 --> 2213.84]  And today, when he says, I thirst, we hear his willingness to participate, to partake in our physical life.
[2213.84 --> 2217.84]  And what that means is that we have a God who understands our suffering.
[2217.84 --> 2218.84]  Right?
[2218.84 --> 2230.84]  In this very statement, Jesus identifies fully with our experience as being men and women, human beings in this world.
[2230.84 --> 2232.84]  He knows our distresses.
[2232.84 --> 2234.84]  He knows our discomforts.
[2234.84 --> 2239.84]  He suffered bodily on the cross and he provided real blood to protect us.
[2239.84 --> 2245.84]  And like the Hebrews, by faith, we must take the blood that is provided.
[2245.84 --> 2253.84]  But that's, I think, the first reason why Jesus became a man and why he died physically on the cross.
[2253.84 --> 2256.84]  Why he suffered for us.
[2256.84 --> 2260.84]  But I also believe there's a second reason I want to share with you.
[2260.84 --> 2267.84]  He wasn't only to become our Passover lamb and to save us from destruction by his blood shed for us.
[2267.84 --> 2276.84]  Secondly, Jesus was thirsty in order that he might satisfy our spiritual longing for God.
[2276.84 --> 2286.84]  See, Jesus, I think, suffered parched lips so that we might be able to then drink from the wells of salvation.
[2286.84 --> 2291.84]  In John chapter 4, Jesus is traveling through Samaria.
[2291.84 --> 2293.84]  It's the middle of the day.
[2293.84 --> 2294.84]  He's traveling.
[2294.84 --> 2295.84]  It's hot.
[2295.84 --> 2296.84]  He's thirsty.
[2296.84 --> 2297.84]  He's tired from the journey.
[2297.84 --> 2300.84]  So he goes and he sits down next to a well.
[2300.84 --> 2304.84]  And when a Samaritan woman comes to draw water, Jesus doesn't have a cup.
[2304.84 --> 2306.84]  He asks her for a drink.
[2306.84 --> 2309.84]  So they're having this conversation about water.
[2309.84 --> 2313.84]  Then in verse 14, this is what Jesus says to the woman.
[2313.84 --> 2317.84]  Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
[2317.84 --> 2325.84]  Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.
[2325.84 --> 2326.84]  Right?
[2326.84 --> 2332.84]  Jesus tells her he can give her water that if you drink it again, you will never be thirsty again.
[2332.84 --> 2337.84]  She's very interested in this water because she doesn't want to have to come to the well anymore.
[2337.84 --> 2339.84]  But what's Jesus talking about?
[2339.84 --> 2351.84]  What he's talking about is in the Bible, thirst is a metaphor for the emptiness that we experience that comes from our spiritual separation from God.
[2351.84 --> 2355.84]  In Psalm 42, the psalmist says,
[2355.84 --> 2365.84]  As the deer pants, longs, thirsts for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.
[2365.84 --> 2369.84]  My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[2369.84 --> 2375.84]  So when Jesus is talking to the woman at the well, he's looking into her heart.
[2375.84 --> 2379.84]  And he's showing her her spiritual thirst.
[2379.84 --> 2391.84]  He says, if you put that bucket of your heart down a well to get water that is anything but the water that I can give you, you will always be thirsty.
[2391.84 --> 2392.84]  Right?
[2392.84 --> 2404.84]  He's saying that the spiritual thirst of your soul, that restlessness that we all have, a search for love and significance and security to fill our desires, our thirst.
[2404.84 --> 2412.84]  He's saying he will never be satisfied except by the water that I give you.
[2412.84 --> 2417.84]  Because what you have, that thirst is really a spiritual thirst for God.
[2417.84 --> 2420.84]  And Jesus says, only I can satisfy that.
[2421.84 --> 2426.84]  We need the living water that quenches the deepest thirst of our souls.
[2427.84 --> 2430.84]  And how is Jesus then going to give us this living water?
[2431.84 --> 2434.84]  By dying in our place as our substitute.
[2434.84 --> 2444.84]  Jesus is saying to us, on the cross I thirsted so that you could have living water welling up within you.
[2445.84 --> 2451.84]  I died so this life could be yours and that you could then be satisfied by God.
[2454.84 --> 2456.84]  And what's our response, friends?
[2457.84 --> 2459.84]  Our response is to come and drink.
[2459.84 --> 2462.84]  And that's what Jesus says in John chapter 7.
[2462.84 --> 2466.84]  On the last day of the Passover feast, Jesus cried out,
[2467.84 --> 2472.84]  Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.
[2473.84 --> 2475.84]  And that's Jesus' invitation to you this morning.
[2476.84 --> 2477.84]  Come to me and drink.
[2478.84 --> 2483.84]  There is a thirst which only Jesus can quench.
[2485.84 --> 2488.84]  And I'll close with this.
[2488.84 --> 2494.84]  There is a great testimony of this reality, this going to Jesus to have our thirst quench.
[2494.84 --> 2501.84]  And it comes from Malcolm Muggeridge, who was a very successful journalist, a social critic in England.
[2502.84 --> 2503.84]  A brilliant man.
[2504.84 --> 2506.84]  He became a Christian much later in life.
[2507.84 --> 2511.84]  And I want to read a passage that he wrote in a book called Jesus Rediscovered.
[2511.84 --> 2512.84]  This is what he writes.
[2512.84 --> 2516.84]  I may, I suppose,
[2517.84 --> 2518.84]  Not yet.
[2518.84 --> 2519.84]  Hold on that one. Thanks.
[2520.84 --> 2526.84]  I may, I suppose, regard myself as being a relatively successful man.
[2527.84 --> 2530.84]  People occasionally stare at me in the street.
[2531.84 --> 2532.84]  That's fame.
[2532.84 --> 2539.84]  I can fairly easily earn enough to qualify for admission to the highest slopes of inland revenue.
[2539.84 --> 2542.84]  I'm not sure what that means, but he writes,
[2542.84 --> 2543.84]  That's success.
[2543.84 --> 2546.84]  Furnished with money and a little fame,
[2547.84 --> 2551.84]  Even the elderly, if they care to, can partake of trendy diversions.
[2552.84 --> 2553.84]  That's pleasure.
[2553.84 --> 2564.84]  It might happen once in a while that something I said or wrote was sufficiently heated to persuade myself that it represented a serious impact on our time.
[2565.84 --> 2566.84]  That's fulfillment.
[2567.84 --> 2570.84]  Yet I say to you, and I beg of you to believe me,
[2570.84 --> 2588.84]  Multiply these tiny triumphs by a million, add them all together, and they are nothing, less than nothing, a positive impediment measured against one drought of that living water that Christ offers to the spiritually thirsty.
[2588.84 --> 2589.84]  Right?
[2589.84 --> 2599.84]  He's saying all the fulfillment, all the fame, all of the prosperity and the pleasure of this world that this man had experienced in life.
[2600.84 --> 2602.84]  And he experienced all of those things.
[2602.84 --> 2604.84]  He says, I was a successful man.
[2605.84 --> 2613.84]  But he said none of it, not even for a second, could compare to a sip of the water that comes from Jesus Christ.
[2613.84 --> 2626.84]  And so, if you are here this morning and you have not yet come to Christ, and if you are dying of thirst, this is the invitation to you.
[2626.84 --> 2627.84]  Come to him.
[2627.84 --> 2630.84]  And he will satisfy your soul.
[2631.84 --> 2638.84]  But friends, if you have come to Christ, but maybe you are not continually drinking from that well of living water.
[2638.84 --> 2649.84]  Maybe, having come to him, you still seek to quench your thirst from the salty water of the world that just leaves you more and more thirsty.
[2649.84 --> 2655.84]  If that is you, then the invitation is to go back to Jesus.
[2655.84 --> 2659.84]  To drink from him that you may be truly satisfied.
[2659.84 --> 2667.84]  So, in closing, I want to share with you a stanza from a Lutheran hymn.
[2667.84 --> 2669.84]  It's called, I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say.
[2670.84 --> 2675.84]  I heard the voice of Jesus say, Behold, I freely give.
[2675.84 --> 2680.84]  The living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live.
[2680.84 --> 2686.84]  I came to Jesus and I drank of that life-giving stream.
[2686.84 --> 2691.84]  My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him.
[2691.84 --> 2702.84]  Friends, let us drink deeply of Jesus and experience the full satisfaction of life that only he can give to us.
[2702.84 --> 2703.84]  Let's pray.
[2703.84 --> 2704.84]  Let's pray.
[2704.84 --> 2716.84]  Our Heavenly Father, we are thirsty creatures.
[2716.84 --> 2723.84]  Lord, and not just physically, as human beings, but spiritually.
[2723.84 --> 2735.84]  As men and women and children created in God's image, created for a relationship with the living God, but we have been cut off from that stream of relationship with him.
[2735.84 --> 2747.84]  We thank you that Jesus on the cross was parched in his soul so that we might drink from the waters of life that he came to offer us.
[2747.84 --> 2759.84]  Father, we pray that you would cause us and call us to drink, to trust in you, to have faith in you, that you really can satisfy us.
[2759.84 --> 2761.84]  To believe it and to live that way.
[2761.84 --> 2764.84]  Would we be satisfied by you alone?
[2764.84 --> 2776.84]  Would we then be, would we be nourished, strengthened to live out a life of faith in the world and offer this living water to all those who also are thirsty?
[2776.84 --> 2781.84]  Lord, would you help us and we pray for the help of the Spirit.
[2781.84 --> 2783.84]  In Christ's name, Amen.
[2783.84 --> 2788.84]  So invite the worship team to come up and let's stand.
[2788.84 --> 2791.84]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[2791.84 --> 2808.84]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[2808.84 --> 2822.84]  Lord, I come, I confess, bowing here I find my rest.
[2822.84 --> 2829.84]  And without you I fall apart.
[2829.84 --> 2837.84]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[2837.84 --> 2838.84]  Lord, I need you.
[2838.84 --> 2839.84]  Lord, I need you.
[2839.84 --> 2840.84]  Lord, I need you.
[2840.84 --> 2842.84]  Lord, I need you.
[2842.84 --> 2845.84]  Oh, I need you.
[2845.84 --> 2852.84]  Every hour I need you.
[2852.84 --> 2858.84]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[2858.84 --> 2859.84]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[2859.84 --> 2860.84]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[2860.84 --> 2874.84]  Where sin has deep, your grace is more.
[2874.84 --> 2875.84]  When grace is more.
[2875.84 --> 2877.84]  When grace is more.
[2877.84 --> 2878.84]  Where you are.
[2878.84 --> 2883.84]  Where you are.
[2883.84 --> 2885.84]  Lord, I am free.
[2885.84 --> 2887.84]  I am free.
[2889.04 --> 2889.84]  Only this
[2891.56 --> 2893.84]  is Christ in me.
[2895.60 --> 2897.84]  Where you are,
[2898.74 --> 2901.20]  Lord, I am free.
[2902.48 --> 2903.84]  Only this
[2905.06 --> 2907.84]  is Christ in me.
[2911.84 --> 2914.92]  Lord, I need you,
[2914.92 --> 2918.92]  Lord, I need you.
[2919.92 --> 2921.92]  Every hour
[2921.92 --> 2924.92]  I need you.
[2925.92 --> 2927.92]  My right defense,
[2928.92 --> 2930.92]  my righteousness,
[2931.92 --> 2935.92]  O God, how I need you.
[2938.92 --> 2942.92]  So teach my soul to Christ to you.
[2944.92 --> 2948.92]  When temptation comes my way,
[2949.92 --> 2951.92]  When I cannot stand,
[2951.92 --> 2953.92]  I'll fall on you.
[2953.92 --> 2954.92]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2954.92 --> 2955.92]  When I get lost, I'll fall on you.
[2955.92 --> 2958.92]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2958.92 --> 2961.92]  When I get lost, I'll fall on you.
[2961.92 --> 2963.92]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[2963.92 --> 2965.92]  When I get lost, I'll fall on you.

[2972.92 --> 2973.92]  Lord, I need you.
[2973.92 --> 2977.92]  Lord, I need you.
[2977.92 --> 2978.92]  I need you.
[2978.92 --> 2979.92]  Oh, I need you.
[2979.92 --> 2980.92]  Oh, I need you.
[2980.92 --> 2984.92]  Every hour I need you.
[2984.92 --> 2989.92]  Every hour I need you.
[2989.92 --> 2994.92]  My one defense, my righteousness,
[2994.92 --> 2997.92]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[2997.92 --> 3002.92]  Oh, God, how I need you.

[3009.92 --> 3030.92]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[3030.92 --> 3032.92]  It is time for our offerings
[3032.92 --> 3034.92]  and our monetary gifts today
[3034.92 --> 3036.92]  are going to World Renew
[3036.92 --> 3038.92]  and more specifically to the programs
[3038.92 --> 3039.92]  that World Renew runs
[3039.92 --> 3042.92]  for those that are trying to resettle in Canada,
[3042.92 --> 3047.92]  both in terms of the resources to the sponsors
[3047.92 --> 3050.92]  and direct aid to those newly arrived.
[3050.92 --> 3053.92]  So we have opportunity to support that at this time.
[3066.92 --> 3067.92]  Laura ball is hello.
[3067.92 --> 3069.92]  We're with Jesus in help.
[3069.92 --> 3072.92]  So we're attending a prayer garden.
[3072.92 --> 3073.92]  So there is a prayer garden,
[3073.92 --> 3075.92]  I need you to go through and leave.
[3076.42 --> 3077.92]  If this is time for us.
[3077.92 --> 3079.92]  But since my heart,
[3079.92 --> 3081.92]  we will return to God.
[3081.92 --> 3082.92]  We are 25, light up with our disciples.
[3082.92 --> 3083.92]  Ske astronauts for us.
[3083.92 --> 3085.92]  We'll leave.

[3087.92 --> 3089.92]  hopefully,
[3089.92 --> 3091.92]  You see where he went.
[3091.92 --> 3093.92]  Amen.
[3121.92 --> 3123.92]  Amen.
[3151.92 --> 3153.60]  Please join me in prayer.
[3156.50 --> 3165.58]  God of our salvation, we praise you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer for our sins so that we may be redeemed.
[3166.32 --> 3174.06]  We are thankful for the reminders of that redemption visible in our own lives as we experience your saving grace each and every day.
[3174.06 --> 3190.00]  We also ask that as a source of the world's hope and redemption, you hear our prayers on behalf of all creation as we try to understand what it means to be stewards of your creation and how that affects our actions every day.
[3191.84 --> 3203.00]  We ask that you hear our prayers on behalf of all those forced to flee their homes, whether through war, conflict, disasters or violence, or religious persecution.
[3204.06 --> 3219.32]  As the numbers of displaced people grows beyond 26 million, we pray that we can play a role in offering a place of refuge and a new beginning wherever we can, always mindful of your command to care for those in need.
[3220.50 --> 3224.38]  We ask that you hear our prayers for an end to the war in Ukraine.
[3224.38 --> 3238.66]  Please work in the hearts of the leaders of the world and grant them the will, the wisdom, and the compassion to find a way to bring peace and end the horrors that we see unfolding before us in real time.
[3238.66 --> 3254.50]  We pray that in time, people can return to homes and rebuild where needed, and that the global compassion for those affected by this tragedy can continue there and beyond into the many other parts of the world that are also experiencing crisis.
[3254.50 --> 3265.74]  We ask that you hear our prayers for comfort for all those mourning the loss of Joan Bauman and Hank Nyman this past week.
[3266.74 --> 3273.52]  Please be near Jerry and all those connected to Joan as they prepare to honour her time with us that ended on Monday.
[3274.34 --> 3279.96]  Please be near the Nyman family as they too are mourning with the unexpected loss of Hank on Tuesday.
[3279.96 --> 3286.56]  And we pray for the Bintal family as they, at last, are able to prepare to celebrate the life of Tim.
[3287.76 --> 3299.62]  May each of these services be a time to grieve our loss, but also a time to celebrate each of their lives, and also a time to reflect on your promise of eternal life with you.
[3301.76 --> 3305.68]  We ask that you hear our prayers for healing for Ellie Beeksmout.
[3305.68 --> 3314.90]  As she continues on the long road to recovery from her broken hip, just pray for patience and comfort for her as she goes through rehab.
[3316.16 --> 3329.44]  We ask that you hear our prayers on behalf of all those who are sick or recovering from accident or dealing with ongoing health issues that reduce mobility and ability to get out and interact with others.
[3330.02 --> 3334.82]  May we never stop caring for and praying for those in need.
[3334.82 --> 3343.64]  All this we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to whom belong all glory and honour. Amen.
[3343.64 --> 3343.76]  Amen.
[3353.46 --> 3354.22]  Please rise.
[3356.22 --> 3363.54]  Next week, well I guess on Friday, they're supposed to, Lord willing, lift the restrictions on being able to serve food.
[3363.54 --> 3369.50]  So I hope next Sunday, we will be able to enjoy some coffee fellowship together after the service.
[3370.14 --> 3371.44]  So we look forward to that.
[3372.36 --> 3376.94]  Now I invite you to hold out your hands and it's a gesture of receiving the blessing of your Heavenly Father.
[3377.66 --> 3386.80]  May the love of God the Father, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with each of you now and forever.
[3387.18 --> 3387.46]  Amen.
[3387.46 --> 3411.84]  Father, we love you.
[3411.84 --> 3412.88]  When we worship and adore you.
[3412.88 --> 3416.80]  When we worship and adore you.

[3426.14 --> 3433.84]  Glorify your name.
[3433.84 --> 3438.62]  glorify your name
[3438.62 --> 3442.56]  with all the earth
[3442.56 --> 3448.56]  Jesus we love you
[3448.56 --> 3453.44]  we worship and adore you
[3453.44 --> 3457.26]  glorify your name
[3457.26 --> 3460.84]  with all the earth
[3460.84 --> 3467.48]  glorify your name
[3467.48 --> 3471.72]  glorify your name
[3471.72 --> 3475.48]  glorify your name
[3475.48 --> 3479.32]  with all the earth

[3502.04 --> 3507.98]  glorify your name
[3507.98 --> 3512.00]  glorify your name
[3512.00 --> 3518.04]  Thank you very much.
[3542.00 --> 3544.00]  Amen.
[3572.00 --> 3574.00]  Amen.
[3602.00 --> 3604.00]  Amen.
