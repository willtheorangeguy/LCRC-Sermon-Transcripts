• The mystery of the gospel is that Gentiles are heirs together with Israel through Christ
• The speaker has been given a gift of God's grace to preach the boundless riches of Christ and make known God's administration in the church
• A missionary couple, Martin and Gracia Burnham, were kidnapped by terrorists for 376 days but shared the gospel with their captors
• The Burnhams saw themselves as prisoners of Jesus Christ rather than their human captors
• They showed joy even under hard conditions and served others through sharing food and repairing a satellite phone
• Paul is writing to the Ephesians from jail and addressing their potential discouragement
• The gospel message is bigger and broader than they can imagine
• Despite Paul's imprisonment, the gospel is still spreading and growing
• Paul encourages the Ephesian church not to be discouraged by his sufferings, but rather to see the larger picture of God's plan
• The word "mystery" in its general sense refers to something hidden or unknown
• A mystery is often something to be figured out or solved, as seen in stories and crimes
• However, the New Testament uses the word "mystery" differently, referring to things revealed by God
• These mysteries were not understood by men in past generations but have now been revealed by the Spirit
• The New Testament explains that true understanding of God's work is a result of divine revelation, not human intelligence or study
• The mystery of the gospel revealed by God is that Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members of one body and sharers in the promise of Christ Jesus.
• This mystery was previously unimaginable to Paul.
• The Gentiles do not have to become Jews in order to be saved; they can remain as Gentiles and still be part of God's people.
• In a spiritual and covenantal sense, all believers will be referred to as the Israel of God, but they get to stay as their original identity (Gentile or other).
• This is an astonishing message, especially for Jews, because traditional Judaism emphasizes ethnicity over belief in salvation.
• The importance of keeping the Quran in Arabic
• Comparison between Islam and Hinduism, with a focus on the concept of an ethnic religion

• Letting go of cultural differences, including language and dietary laws
• The challenge of fellowship between people from different cultures
• The mistake of equating culture with faith
• The need to define a church by the gospel rather than a particular culture
• Examples of this issue in history, including the residential school system in Canada
• Diversity in the church and cultures coming together
• The gospel being bigger than one's own culture or identity
• The manifold wisdom of God being made known to rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms through the church
• The mystery of God bringing Gentiles and Jews together in a new humanity
• Understanding the "rulers and authorities" mentioned in Ephesians 3:10 as referring to spiritual beings in heaven, rather than earthly rulers
• Spiritual entities, including angels and demons

• Reconciliation between humans and with each other
• The connection between human actions and the spiritual realm
• The NIV's attempt to be gender inclusive results in missing family language used by Paul
• Before becoming sons of God, we are sons of Satan and part of his kingdom
• Through the Spirit, being born again makes us children of God, not Satan
• This shifts from Satan's household to God's household growing with new members
• The church proclaims salvation, transplants children of Satan into sons of God
• This is a manifestation of God's manifold wisdom in the world and heaven
