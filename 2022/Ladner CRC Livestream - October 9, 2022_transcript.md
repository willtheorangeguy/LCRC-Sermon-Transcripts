[305.88 --> 306.88]  Good morning.
[306.88 --> 307.88]  Good morning.
[307.88 --> 314.88]  Welcome to our worship service at Ladner Christian Reformed Church on this Thanksgiving weekend.
[314.88 --> 320.88]  We're happy you could be with us today, whether you're in person or joining us on YouTube.
[320.88 --> 326.88]  If you're a visitor, we are especially pleased that you're worshiping with us today.
[326.88 --> 335.88]  Please join us for coffee after the service, and it will be in the foyer today, just outside the doors at the back of the sanctuary.
[336.88 --> 340.88]  I'm Elaine, and I'll be the worship leader for part of this service.
[340.88 --> 349.88]  Today is Family Worship Sunday, and we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper together with our friends from the Chinese Ministry.
[349.88 --> 354.88]  And there will also be a children's message for the younger members of the church.
[354.88 --> 364.88]  And Pastor Jason will bring us a message on the Spirit-filled life as he continues his Life Together series on Ephesians.
[364.88 --> 375.88]  And at this time, Pastor Jason would like to introduce to us a friend who is the guest pastor for the Mandarin congregation today.
[379.88 --> 382.88]  That's good morning. I especially wanted to welcome my friend Jim Graham, who's here.
[382.88 --> 385.88]  He's sitting in the back. Wave, Jim. There he is.
[385.88 --> 389.88]  So Jim was also a missionary at the same time I was in Taiwan.
[389.88 --> 391.88]  And so we get to know each other there.
[391.88 --> 393.88]  He's from the Baptist Mission.
[393.88 --> 397.88]  But one cool thing about being on the mission field is that it doesn't matter.
[397.88 --> 400.88]  We're serving the same God and we're on the same mission together.
[400.88 --> 403.88]  Jim moved back here. He lives in Richmond.
[403.88 --> 408.88]  moved back three years ago to continue to serve the Chinese churches here locally.
[408.88 --> 413.88]  So he will be speaking for our Mandarin ministry today.
[414.88 --> 420.88]  My second announcement is that for you kids, I hope that you got one of these strips of paper.
[420.88 --> 423.88]  And if you didn't get one, our ushers can help you get one.
[423.88 --> 426.88]  So what I'd like you to do is to write down something you're thankful for.
[426.88 --> 431.88]  Okay, anything you want. Maybe parents, you can help write for your kids who can't.
[431.88 --> 436.88]  Write down something you are thankful for and then bring it up when we have our children's message.
[436.88 --> 437.88]  Thank you.
[445.88 --> 448.88]  So I have just a couple of announcements.
[448.88 --> 454.88]  Cross training did not meet this morning, but we'll continue next week Sunday morning at 930.
[454.88 --> 457.88]  And everybody is welcome.
[457.88 --> 464.88]  And I was reminded by Dorothy this week that our church's anniversary is on Tuesday, October 11,
[464.88 --> 470.88]  72 years after its official beginning in 1950.
[470.88 --> 475.88]  Is there anybody here who was there at that time? 1950?
[475.88 --> 479.88]  All right, I see one hand, two hands, there we go.
[479.88 --> 482.88]  Wonderful, wonderful.
[482.88 --> 491.88]  And as a special note, of course, most of you know this, that my grandfather, Reverend Paul de Kukuk,
[491.88 --> 499.88]  who was the first pastor here in his role as the Christian Reform Home Missionary for Lower B.C. Mainland and Vancouver Island.
[499.88 --> 506.88]  And we are so thankful to God for his faithfulness to this church through all these years.
[506.88 --> 514.88]  Okay, our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 108.
[514.88 --> 519.88]  Our hearts are ready, O Lord. Our hearts are ready.
[519.88 --> 522.88]  We will sing and make melody.
[522.88 --> 525.88]  We will awaken the dawn.
[525.88 --> 529.88]  We will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[529.88 --> 533.88]  We will sing praises to you among the nations.
[533.88 --> 542.88]  For your steadfast love is great above the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
[542.88 --> 547.88]  And the Lord greets us this morning with these words from 2 John.
[547.88 --> 559.88]  Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.
[559.88 --> 563.88]  As God has greeted us, let us greet each other this morning.
[563.88 --> 564.88]  Let me rise.
[564.88 --> 566.88]  Amen.
[566.88 --> 568.88]  Amen.
[568.88 --> 569.88]  Amen.
[569.88 --> 570.88]  Amen.
[570.88 --> 572.88]  Amen.
[572.88 --> 574.88]  Amen.
[574.88 --> 575.88]  Amen.
[575.88 --> 577.88]  Amen.
[577.88 --> 579.88]  Amen.
[579.88 --> 580.88]  Amen.
[580.88 --> 581.88]  Amen.
[581.88 --> 583.88]  Amen.
[583.88 --> 585.88]  Amen.
[585.88 --> 586.88]  Amen.
[586.88 --> 587.88]  Amen.
[587.88 --> 588.88]  Amen.
[588.88 --> 589.88]  Amen.
[589.88 --> 590.88]  Amen.
[590.88 --> 595.38]  Amen.
[595.38 --> 597.88]  Amen for Our W strings tooise iser and to place the earth's that they call us in taken for each of us,
[597.88 --> 612.26]  For dawn's early rays and bright blue skies,
[612.76 --> 618.10]  for refreshing rains and clear air and alleviate thirst,
[618.10 --> 622.88]  for the heat of the summer sun and the winter fire, we thank you, Lord.
[622.88 --> 627.88]  For the thunder of waterfalls and engines, for the roar of utter silence,
[628.88 --> 633.46]  for the music that delights our ears, compelling dance, we thank you, Lord.
[639.46 --> 650.00]  This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears,
[650.00 --> 660.18]  all nature sings and round me rings, the music of the stairs.
[660.78 --> 670.38]  This is my Father's world, I wish me in the thought,
[670.38 --> 680.76]  All rocks and trees, of skies and seas, His hand of wonders strong.
[680.76 --> 693.10]  This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise,
[693.10 --> 703.24]  The morning light, the lily white, declare their neighbor's praise.
[703.24 --> 713.52]  This is my Father's world, He shines in all that's fair.
[713.52 --> 722.62]  In the rustling grass I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere.
[722.62 --> 735.10]  This is my Father's world, O let me not forget,
[735.10 --> 745.62]  That though the long seems up so strong, God is the ruler's hand.
[745.62 --> 747.62]  This is my Father's world, O let me not forget,
[747.62 --> 752.62]  This is my Father's world, O let me not forget,
[752.62 --> 755.62]  Why should my heart be set?
[755.62 --> 761.62]  The Lord is King, let the heavens bring,
[761.62 --> 766.62]  The praise that the earth be glad.
[766.62 --> 774.18]  For the innocence of children and the wisdom of age,
[774.18 --> 777.80]  For the uproarious laughter and softly whispered prayer,
[778.30 --> 781.16]  For silly moments and the cleansing of tears,
[781.68 --> 782.64]  We thank you, Lord.
[783.48 --> 786.28]  For healthy bodies and access to medical care,
[786.70 --> 789.40]  For inquisitive intellect and ability to learn,
[789.78 --> 793.44]  For education, books, stage and stereos,
[793.62 --> 794.50]  We thank you, Lord.
[796.62 --> 797.62]  The Lord is King, let the heavens bring,
[797.62 --> 798.62]  But what should we do?
[798.62 --> 802.62]  We thank you, Lord.
[802.62 --> 805.62]  The Lord is King, let the heavens bring,
[805.62 --> 815.62]  My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is not like you.
[815.62 --> 825.62]  All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[825.62 --> 838.62]  My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength,
[838.62 --> 844.62]  Let every breath, all that I am,
[844.62 --> 851.62]  Never seems to worship you.
[851.62 --> 857.62]  Shout to the Lord, all the earth that I sing,
[857.62 --> 863.62]  Power and majesty praise to the King.
[863.62 --> 869.62]  Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
[869.62 --> 875.62]  At the sound of your name.
[875.62 --> 881.62]  I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
[881.62 --> 882.62]  Forever I'll love you.
[882.62 --> 884.62]  Forever I'll love you.
[884.62 --> 887.62]  Forever I'll stand.
[887.62 --> 896.62]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[896.62 --> 911.62]  My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[911.62 --> 926.62]  All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[926.62 --> 937.62]  My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength,
[937.62 --> 943.62]  Let every breath, all that I am,
[943.62 --> 950.62]  Never seems to worship you.
[950.62 --> 956.62]  Shout to the Lord of the earth, let us sing,
[956.62 --> 963.62]  Power and majesty praise to the King.
[963.62 --> 968.62]  Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
[968.62 --> 975.62]  At the sound of your name.
[975.62 --> 981.62]  I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
[981.62 --> 984.62]  Forever I'll love you.
[984.62 --> 987.62]  Forever I'll stand.
[987.62 --> 997.62]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1005.62 --> 1007.62]  Please be seated.
[1007.62 --> 1011.62]  Thank you.
[1011.62 --> 1016.62]  So we are having our offering time done a little differently this morning.
[1016.62 --> 1024.62]  And in a few minutes we'll have the opportunity to bring our gifts and donations forward.
[1024.62 --> 1030.62]  And we will all come up to the front to bring our designated offerings for World Renew,
[1030.62 --> 1032.62]  Feed a Family,
[1032.62 --> 1036.62]  The Peter Fish Banks, which are also for Feed a Family,
[1036.62 --> 1039.62]  And our South Delta Food Bank donations.
[1039.62 --> 1046.62]  You have all received this brochure about World Renew ministry in your bulletin.
[1046.62 --> 1049.62]  And with our gifts to free a family,
[1049.62 --> 1057.62]  World Renew partners with local churches and non-profits to free families from poverty.
[1057.62 --> 1062.62]  Our gifts help individual lives and their communities.
[1062.62 --> 1067.62]  This Thanksgiving let us give thanks for those whose lives have been changed
[1067.62 --> 1071.62]  Because of the generosity of the Free a Family program.
[1071.62 --> 1076.62]  And also the children will be bringing up their Peter Fish donations.
[1076.62 --> 1082.62]  And when they come up you can bring them, set them right in front of the pulpit,
[1082.62 --> 1086.62]  On the steps right in front here for the Peter Fish.
[1086.62 --> 1092.62]  And there will be deacons at the head of each aisle with baskets when you bring up your offerings.
[1092.62 --> 1095.62]  You can put them in there.
[1095.62 --> 1102.62]  And this Thanksgiving again, we're also very thankful that we're able to share God's bountiful blessings with others.
[1102.62 --> 1108.62]  And your Thanksgiving donations for South Delta Food Bank can be placed in this area.
[1108.62 --> 1112.62]  And there are bins here, some empty bins.
[1112.62 --> 1114.62]  Some of them have a few items in them already.
[1114.62 --> 1118.62]  So if you could take your items and place them in these various bins.
[1118.62 --> 1123.62]  And if they get too full, then you can have, if you have a bag or something, you can just put it up there also.
[1123.62 --> 1126.62]  So thank you again for sharing your blessings.
[1126.62 --> 1130.62]  So we will start at the back of the sanctuary.
[1130.62 --> 1136.62]  So you may come forward at this time with your donations, offerings, and Peter Fish.
[1136.62 --> 1161.62]  So you may come forward, starting at the back of the church, okay?
[1161.62 --> 1170.62]  Strength's third day professor, who will start at the campus of the Mount Holy Hills.
[1170.62 --> 1171.62]  Dolay, thi ، apologize for Christ, okay?
[1171.62 --> 1201.60]  Thank you.
[1201.62 --> 1231.60]  Thank you.
[1231.62 --> 1233.62]  Thank you.
[1261.62 --> 1263.62]  Thank you.
[1291.62 --> 1293.62]  Thank you.
[1293.62 --> 1295.62]  Thank you.
[1295.62 --> 1297.62]  Thank you.
[1297.62 --> 1299.62]  Thank you.
[1299.62 --> 1301.62]  Thank you.
[1301.62 --> 1303.62]  Thank you.
[1303.62 --> 1305.62]  Thank you.
[1305.62 --> 1307.62]  Thank you.
[1307.62 --> 1309.62]  Thank you.
[1309.62 --> 1311.62]  Thank you.
[1311.62 --> 1313.62]  Thank you.
[1313.62 --> 1317.62]  Thank you.
[1317.62 --> 1329.62]  For our time of confession, let us confess our sin before God with one another with these words from Psalm 79.
[1329.62 --> 1335.62]  Help us, God our Savior, for the glory of your name.
[1335.62 --> 1341.62]  Deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.
[1341.62 --> 1349.62]  Do not remember the sins of our youth, and I will not be raised.
[1349.62 --> 1351.62]  Amen.
[1351.62 --> 1359.62]  God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of our sin is from Psalm 72.
[1359.62 --> 1367.62]  Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
[1367.62 --> 1371.62]  Praise be to his glorious name forever.
[1371.62 --> 1375.62]  May the whole earth be filled with his glory.
[1375.62 --> 1379.62]  Amen and amen.
[1379.62 --> 1385.62]  Amen and amen and apaix be to us at the path of forgiveness of God.
[1385.62 --> 1399.84]  Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
[1399.84 --> 1407.32]  My only presence to cheer and to guide
[1407.32 --> 1414.14]  Strength for today and my hope for tomorrow
[1414.14 --> 1421.76]  Blessings of life within thousand beside
[1421.76 --> 1431.04]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness
[1431.04 --> 1438.22]  Morning by morning new mercies I see
[1438.22 --> 1446.10]  All I have made, thy hand has provided
[1446.10 --> 1455.22]  Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me
[1455.22 --> 1485.20]  Brothers and sisters, we come now to the table of the Lord.
[1485.20 --> 1486.96]  To celebrate Holy Communion.
[1487.66 --> 1492.64]  But before we do come to this table, we proclaim our faith together.
[1493.44 --> 1500.28]  Our confession of faith today comes from the Heidelberg Catechism, question and answer number 43.
[1500.28 --> 1511.36]  What further benefit do we receive from Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross?
[1511.86 --> 1512.70]  Let's say it together.
[1512.70 --> 1521.22]  By Christ's power, our old selves are crucified, put to death, and buried with him,
[1521.72 --> 1527.04]  so that the evil desires of the flesh may no longer rule us,
[1527.60 --> 1534.66]  but that instead we may offer ourselves as a sacrifice of gratitude to him.
[1534.66 --> 1544.08]  Congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord has prepared his table for all those who love him
[1544.08 --> 1547.22]  and trust in him alone for salvation.
[1547.22 --> 1555.96]  All those who are truly sorry for their sins, who sincerely believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior,
[1556.82 --> 1560.08]  and who desire to live in obedience to him as Lord,
[1560.96 --> 1567.68]  are bid to come, to come and to feast with him at the table of the Lord.
[1567.68 --> 1578.06]  The Apostle Paul instituted, Jesus himself instituted the Lord's Supper with these words from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians,
[1578.64 --> 1579.68]  as Paul tells us.
[1580.34 --> 1580.70]  He says,
[1580.82 --> 1584.34]  The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread,
[1584.90 --> 1587.34]  and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1587.92 --> 1589.74]  This is my body, which is for you.
[1590.44 --> 1592.48]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1592.48 --> 1597.32]  In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1597.56 --> 1599.66]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1600.18 --> 1604.14]  As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[1605.18 --> 1609.74]  For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1610.20 --> 1614.74]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1617.62 --> 1620.16]  Brothers and sisters, lift up your hearts.
[1620.16 --> 1624.46]  We are his people.
[1627.04 --> 1629.68]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1630.38 --> 1631.48]  Christ has died.
[1632.02 --> 1632.98]  Christ is risen.
[1633.56 --> 1634.90]  Christ will come again.
[1635.46 --> 1638.12]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1638.50 --> 1638.82]  Hallelujah.
[1641.04 --> 1644.66]  Friends, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[1644.66 --> 1651.14]  Take, feed on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving.
[1651.34 --> 1654.44]  One of the words for this table is also the Eucharist.
[1655.26 --> 1657.20]  It's the meal of thanksgiving.
[1658.02 --> 1659.98]  Feed on him in your hearts with thanks,
[1661.14 --> 1665.36]  trusting and believing that Jesus Christ, our Lord, died for us.
[1666.52 --> 1669.12]  May I invite our elders and deacons to come forward
[1669.12 --> 1670.88]  and help me serve the elements.
[1670.88 --> 1671.06]  Thank you.
[1671.06 --> 1671.12]  Thank you.
[1699.12 --> 1722.30]  Take, take this bread I give to you.
[1722.30 --> 1733.50]  And as you do, remember me.
[1735.10 --> 1738.60]  This bread is my body,
[1740.60 --> 1744.60]  broken just for you.
[1744.60 --> 1751.60]  Take it, eat it.
[1751.60 --> 1762.28]  Each time you do, remember me.
[1762.28 --> 1773.90]  Take this bread I give to you.
[1773.90 --> 1780.90]  And as you do, remember me.
[1780.90 --> 1785.90]  And as you do, remember me.
[1785.90 --> 1796.90]  This bread is my body, broken just for you.
[1796.90 --> 1802.90]  Take it, eat it.
[1802.90 --> 1804.90]  Each time you do, remember me.
[1804.90 --> 1809.90]  Each time you do, remember me.
[1809.90 --> 1814.90]  Remember me.
[1814.90 --> 1822.90]  Remember me.
[1822.90 --> 1829.90]  Remember me.
[1829.90 --> 1831.90]  Remember me.
[1831.90 --> 1832.90]  Remember me.
[1832.90 --> 1862.88]  Remember me
[1862.90 --> 1869.18]  Brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe
[1869.18 --> 1874.28]  that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was broken for the forgiveness of our sins.
[1874.60 --> 1875.22]  Let's eat together.
[1892.90 --> 1922.88]  Let's eat together.
[1922.90 --> 1952.88]  Let's eat together.
[1952.88 --> 1958.66]  Let's eat together.
[1958.66 --> 1959.46]  This cup is our new covenant.
[1962.06 --> 1965.88]  I'm making with you.
[1965.88 --> 1983.88]  Take it, drink it, each time you do, remember me.
[1983.88 --> 2000.88]  Take this love I've given you, and yes, you do.
[2000.88 --> 2013.88]  Remember me, remember me.
[2013.88 --> 2036.32]  Oh, as you do, remember me.
[2043.88 --> 2056.88]  Remember me.
[2056.88 --> 2065.88]  Remember me.
[2065.88 --> 2071.88]  Remember me.
[2071.88 --> 2081.88]  Remember me.
[2081.88 --> 2092.88]  Brothers and sisters, take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ was shed for the remission of our sins.
[2092.88 --> 2093.88]  Let's drink.
[2093.88 --> 2101.88]  Would you pray with me?
[2101.88 --> 2111.88]  Eternal God, our Heavenly Father, you have graciously accepted us as living members of your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ.
[2111.88 --> 2117.88]  And you have fed us with spiritual food and the sacrament of his body and blood.
[2117.88 --> 2128.88]  Send us now into the world in peace, and grant us strength and courage to love and serve you with gladness and singleness of heart.
[2128.88 --> 2130.88]  Through Christ, our Lord, we pray.
[2130.88 --> 2131.88]  Amen.
[2131.88 --> 2132.88]  Amen.
[2132.88 --> 2153.88]  Shall we stand?
[2153.88 --> 2154.44]  Shall we stand?
[2162.44 --> 2172.52]  I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene
[2172.52 --> 2177.32]  And wonder how he could love me
[2177.32 --> 2181.78]  A sinner condemned unclean
[2181.78 --> 2186.92]  He took my sins and my sorrows
[2186.92 --> 2190.78]  He made them his very own
[2191.34 --> 2196.18]  He bore the burden to Calvary
[2196.18 --> 2199.78]  And suffered and died alone
[2200.34 --> 2205.78]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[2205.78 --> 2209.78]  And my song shall ever be
[2209.78 --> 2214.92]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[2214.92 --> 2220.06]  Is my Savior's love for me
[2220.06 --> 2225.74]  When with the ransomed in glory
[2225.74 --> 2229.92]  His face I at last shall see
[2229.92 --> 2235.06]  Will be my joy through the ages
[2235.06 --> 2239.86]  To sing of his love for me
[2239.86 --> 2244.86]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[2244.86 --> 2249.06]  And my song shall ever be
[2249.06 --> 2254.20]  How marvelous, how wonderful
[2254.20 --> 2259.20]  Is my Savior's love for me
[2259.20 --> 2264.36]  The angel, how marvelous, how wonderful
[2264.36 --> 2264.40]  And my song shall ever be
[2264.40 --> 2266.58]  In my name
[2266.58 --> 2267.94]  Is my Savior's love for me
[2267.94 --> 2268.30]  I don't give a 300 tree
[2268.30 --> 2270.14]  To sing of His love for me
[2270.14 --> 2270.44]  I don't give a 300 tree
[2270.44 --> 2271.32]  It's my new name
[2271.32 --> 2272.26]  You can give a 300 tree
[2272.26 --> 2272.76]  I just go to God
[2272.76 --> 2275.18]  I need to give a 300 tree
[2275.18 --> 2276.22]  Let's see
[2276.22 --> 2277.50]  If the Noahionar
[2277.50 --> 2278.46]  I love it
[2278.46 --> 2279.58]  To sing of His father
[2279.58 --> 2279.88]  To sing of His side
[2279.88 --> 2290.76]  Make sure you bring your little colored papers.
[2298.76 --> 2303.28]  Come on up, come on up, come on up.
[2306.48 --> 2307.78]  All right, hello.
[2309.88 --> 2318.48]  All right, there's some more seats over here.
[2318.48 --> 2321.48]  All right, leave that.
[2321.48 --> 2325.48]  It's like, where did my allowance go?
[2325.48 --> 2326.48]  Okay.
[2326.48 --> 2332.48]  Okay, thank you.
[2332.48 --> 2336.48]  Okay, so I have a question for you guys.
[2336.48 --> 2340.08]  Hey, look, listen, how are you all today?
[2340.08 --> 2341.08]  Good.
[2341.08 --> 2342.08]  Good, good.
[2342.08 --> 2344.08]  Can you guys put the fish down?
[2344.08 --> 2345.08]  Put the fish down.
[2345.08 --> 2348.08]  Yeah, put it down.
[2348.08 --> 2349.08]  Okay.
[2349.08 --> 2354.08]  Who knows what special day is tomorrow?
[2354.08 --> 2356.08]  You know?
[2356.08 --> 2357.08]  Okay, say it.
[2357.08 --> 2358.08]  Thanksgiving.
[2358.08 --> 2359.08]  Thanksgiving.
[2359.08 --> 2360.08]  Who else knew that?
[2360.08 --> 2362.68]  Thanksgiving, right?
[2362.68 --> 2363.68]  Thanksgiving.
[2363.68 --> 2364.68]  Well, you know what?
[2364.68 --> 2368.68]  The Bible tells us about being thankful.
[2368.68 --> 2370.28]  Thankful.
[2370.28 --> 2374.28]  Who here feels thankful sometimes?
[2374.28 --> 2376.28]  You sometimes feel thankful?
[2376.28 --> 2377.28]  Okay.
[2377.28 --> 2379.88]  What the Bible says.
[2379.88 --> 2387.88]  Always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2387.88 --> 2389.88]  Could you say that with me?
[2389.88 --> 2390.88]  Ready?
[2390.88 --> 2391.88]  Let's say it together.
[2391.88 --> 2393.48]  Let's say it together.
[2393.48 --> 2411.48]  Always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2411.48 --> 2412.48]  Right.
[2412.48 --> 2417.28]  So the Bible says we can give thanks for everything all the time.
[2417.28 --> 2419.28]  There's always something that we could be thankful for.
[2419.28 --> 2422.28]  So today, I have this special bowl.
[2422.28 --> 2423.28]  What do you think of that?
[2423.28 --> 2425.28]  It's a triangle.
[2425.28 --> 2427.28]  It's kind of like a triangle.
[2427.28 --> 2428.28]  Yeah.
[2428.28 --> 2433.28]  So what I would like to do is I want to invite you to put your pieces of paper in my bowl.
[2433.28 --> 2436.28]  And I think after we put it all in, it'll be very pretty.
[2436.28 --> 2440.88]  But first, I want to ask, does anybody want to share what they're thankful for?
[2440.88 --> 2441.88]  Something you wrote down?
[2441.88 --> 2445.28]  You don't have to, but if you want to share, you can.
[2445.28 --> 2446.28]  You can tell us.
[2446.28 --> 2447.28]  What are you thankful for?
[2447.28 --> 2448.28]  Go ahead.
[2448.28 --> 2449.28]  My yard.
[2449.28 --> 2450.28]  Your yard.
[2450.28 --> 2451.28]  Awesome.
[2451.28 --> 2452.28]  Okay.
[2452.28 --> 2453.28]  Who else?
[2453.28 --> 2454.28]  Food and water.
[2454.28 --> 2455.28]  Food and water.
[2455.28 --> 2456.28]  Yeah.
[2456.28 --> 2459.28]  Does anybody else want to share one?
[2459.28 --> 2461.28]  What are you thankful for?
[2461.28 --> 2467.28]  You know what I'm thankful for?
[2467.28 --> 2470.28]  I'm thankful for this church.
[2470.28 --> 2471.28]  Yeah.
[2471.28 --> 2472.28]  How about you?
[2472.28 --> 2473.28]  You too?
[2473.28 --> 2474.28]  Awesome.
[2474.28 --> 2475.28]  Awesome.
[2475.28 --> 2476.28]  Okay.
[2476.28 --> 2477.28]  Well, how about this?
[2477.28 --> 2479.28]  Let's fold our papers in half.
[2479.28 --> 2480.28]  Can you fold them in half?
[2480.28 --> 2481.28]  Yeah.
[2481.28 --> 2483.28]  And let's put them in here.
[2483.28 --> 2485.28]  And then I'll pray for us.
[2485.28 --> 2486.28]  Okay?
[2486.28 --> 2487.28]  Go ahead.
[2487.28 --> 2488.28]  Can you guys all put them in?
[2488.28 --> 2489.28]  I think a half.
[2489.28 --> 2490.28]  This one my sister wrote.
[2490.28 --> 2491.28]  Oh.
[2491.28 --> 2492.28]  Okay.
[2492.28 --> 2493.28]  Yeah?
[2493.28 --> 2494.28]  Look what she wrote.
[2494.28 --> 2495.28]  Very nice.
[2495.28 --> 2496.28]  You're thankful for sheep.
[2496.28 --> 2497.28]  Yeah.
[2497.28 --> 2498.28]  For sheep.
[2498.28 --> 2499.28]  Is that sheep or sleep?
[2499.28 --> 2500.28]  Sheep actually.
[2500.28 --> 2501.28]  Yeah.
[2501.28 --> 2502.28]  All right.
[2502.28 --> 2505.28]  What did you put?
[2505.28 --> 2506.28]  I can't see.
[2506.28 --> 2507.28]  Mama.
[2507.28 --> 2508.28]  Mama and Papa?
[2508.28 --> 2509.28]  Yeah.
[2509.28 --> 2510.28]  Ah.
[2510.28 --> 2511.28]  Very nice.
[2511.28 --> 2512.28]  And something else on there.
[2512.28 --> 2513.28]  I didn't see it.
[2513.28 --> 2514.28]  Okay.
[2514.28 --> 2515.28]  Over here?
[2515.28 --> 2516.28]  Yeah.
[2516.28 --> 2517.28]  All right.
[2517.28 --> 2518.28]  Put them in.
[2518.28 --> 2519.28]  Any more?
[2519.28 --> 2521.28]  Would you like to put yours in?
[2521.28 --> 2523.28]  And another one.
[2523.28 --> 2524.28]  Thank you.
[2524.28 --> 2525.28]  One fell out.
[2525.28 --> 2526.28]  So what do you think?
[2526.28 --> 2527.28]  How does this look?
[2527.28 --> 2528.28]  Is that kind of pretty?
[2528.28 --> 2529.28]  Yeah.
[2529.28 --> 2530.28]  Yeah.
[2530.28 --> 2531.28]  It is.
[2531.28 --> 2532.28]  Yeah.
[2532.28 --> 2533.28]  Okay.
[2533.28 --> 2534.28]  It's kind of like a rainbow.
[2534.28 --> 2535.28]  Thanksgiving rainbow.
[2535.28 --> 2536.28]  Let's pray.
[2536.28 --> 2540.28]  Dear Lord, we thank you for all that you give us.
[2540.28 --> 2543.28]  You are so kind to us.
[2543.28 --> 2545.28]  You provide all that we need.
[2545.28 --> 2547.28]  So we thank you, our Father.
[2547.28 --> 2553.28]  Lord, be with the children now as they go to their Sunday school and as they continue to worship with us.
[2553.28 --> 2554.28]  We pray in Jesus name.
[2554.28 --> 2555.28]  Amen.
[2555.28 --> 2556.28]  All right.
[2556.28 --> 2558.28]  So be thankful to God always.
[2558.28 --> 2559.28]  Can you remember that?
[2559.28 --> 2560.28]  Yeah.
[2560.28 --> 2561.28]  Okay.
[2561.28 --> 2562.28]  Go ahead back.
[2562.28 --> 2566.28]  All right.
[2566.28 --> 2567.28]  We thank you.
[2567.28 --> 2572.28]  I'm just going to recognize that the children ages three through kindergarten.
[2572.28 --> 2580.28]  Three through kindergarten will be dismissed for kids' life now.
[2580.28 --> 2587.28]  And the Chinese congregation is also dismissed at this point to go to their worship service.
[2587.28 --> 2589.34]  us a program.
[2617.28 --> 2644.08]  Ephesians chapter 5, verse 14 to 21.
[2644.08 --> 2650.28]  For this is light that makes everything visible.
[2651.00 --> 2652.92]  This is why it is said,
[2653.92 --> 2662.36]  Wake up, all sleepers, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
[2662.36 --> 2669.66]  Be very careful, then, how you live, not as unwise, but as wise,
[2669.66 --> 2676.32]  making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
[2677.38 --> 2683.82]  Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
[2684.38 --> 2689.80]  Do not get drunk on wine, which needs to debauchery.
[2689.80 --> 2693.90]  Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
[2694.60 --> 2699.76]  Speak to one another with songs, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[2700.54 --> 2704.16]  Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord.
[2704.72 --> 2708.98]  Always give thanks to God the Father for everything.
[2708.98 --> 2717.50]  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[2718.06 --> 2720.38]  This is the word of God.
[2720.98 --> 2722.40]  Thanks be to God.
[2722.40 --> 2730.86]  Thank you, Shirley.
[2732.24 --> 2733.42]  Please join me in prayer.
[2736.76 --> 2740.32]  Our Father, we thank you that we are your children.
[2740.32 --> 2749.10]  And Father, we come to sit at the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2750.10 --> 2754.76]  and to sit at the feet of your word.
[2755.56 --> 2757.02]  And we want to learn from you today.
[2757.68 --> 2760.16]  So I ask that you would open the eyes of our hearts,
[2760.62 --> 2763.12]  by your Holy Spirit that is at work within us,
[2763.54 --> 2765.86]  that we might know your amazing love for us,
[2765.86 --> 2768.20]  and walk more obediently with you.
[2769.02 --> 2771.00]  In Christ's name we pray.
[2771.52 --> 2771.88]  Amen.
[2774.62 --> 2777.04]  So as many of you will know, if you've been here,
[2777.76 --> 2780.82]  we have, and for those of you who don't know, I'll let you know,
[2781.16 --> 2782.48]  we've been in the book of Ephesians.
[2782.48 --> 2785.66]  We have been in Ephesians for several months now.
[2786.56 --> 2788.28]  And here in the second half of the letter,
[2788.90 --> 2790.74]  in chapters 4 to 6,
[2791.58 --> 2795.54]  Paul begins teaching very practically
[2795.54 --> 2798.08]  about the Christian life,
[2798.56 --> 2803.36]  and about what it looks like to be his church in the world.
[2804.40 --> 2808.22]  So now as we begin to look at our passage this morning,
[2808.56 --> 2810.08]  let me ask you a question.
[2812.08 --> 2814.46]  Have you ever had this experience,
[2814.96 --> 2817.42]  where you're driving home from work,
[2817.52 --> 2819.30]  or you're driving home from somewhere,
[2819.60 --> 2820.92]  or maybe riding the Skytrain,
[2820.92 --> 2823.54]  and by the time you get home,
[2823.60 --> 2826.74]  you realize that you are not actually consciously engaged
[2826.74 --> 2829.28]  in what you are doing for the entire journey home.
[2829.92 --> 2832.42]  All you know is that you managed to get home.
[2833.10 --> 2834.12]  Has anyone done that before?
[2834.88 --> 2835.52]  Okay, a few.
[2835.52 --> 2837.20]  I was like, maybe it'd just be me.
[2837.20 --> 2841.86]  But it's kind of scary when you're navigating traffic,
[2841.98 --> 2843.06]  you're driving, and then you're just like,
[2843.76 --> 2845.20]  oh, how did I get here?
[2845.68 --> 2845.82]  Right?
[2845.98 --> 2847.64]  You're like, oh man, I'm glad something didn't happen.
[2848.70 --> 2849.98]  Or maybe you're reading a book,
[2850.00 --> 2851.26]  and you read several pages
[2851.26 --> 2854.84]  before you realize you have no idea what you just read.
[2855.54 --> 2857.42]  You actually read every word,
[2858.10 --> 2860.06]  but you weren't engaged in the story.
[2860.06 --> 2861.38]  So if you want to know what happened,
[2861.46 --> 2863.66]  you actually have to go back and read it again.
[2863.66 --> 2866.00]  You know, sometimes this happens
[2866.00 --> 2868.40]  when we do things that we're very used to,
[2868.62 --> 2871.40]  whether it's driving or reading or something else.
[2871.88 --> 2873.58]  Just something we're very familiar with.
[2874.12 --> 2877.40]  Our minds are somewhere else entirely.
[2878.12 --> 2880.86]  You're not engaged with what you're doing.
[2882.26 --> 2883.86]  Now, can you imagine
[2883.86 --> 2888.98]  if you were to live your whole life in that way?
[2888.98 --> 2893.74]  Paul this morning is writing to help us see
[2893.74 --> 2895.34]  that there is the same danger
[2895.34 --> 2899.64]  of living our lives completely unaware,
[2900.64 --> 2903.78]  where we just go through our days moment by moment,
[2904.98 --> 2906.28]  day by day,
[2907.44 --> 2911.12]  entirely unaware of a greater reality,
[2911.12 --> 2913.26]  of a greater truth of our lives,
[2913.62 --> 2914.66]  of who we are,
[2915.24 --> 2916.90]  of where we have come from,
[2916.90 --> 2919.02]  of what our purpose is,
[2919.52 --> 2921.04]  like what we are meant to be doing.
[2922.12 --> 2924.44]  We live almost in a daze,
[2924.58 --> 2925.78]  kind of on autopilot.
[2927.12 --> 2928.26]  So Paul tells us here
[2928.26 --> 2931.06]  that we are not to live lives that are dulled,
[2931.24 --> 2933.50]  that are unaware of what's going on,
[2933.54 --> 2937.48]  but rather we are to live wide awake to God
[2937.48 --> 2941.32]  and to be alive to the glorious reality
[2941.32 --> 2943.62]  of living life in the Spirit of God,
[2944.08 --> 2946.50]  of living a Spirit-filled life.
[2947.56 --> 2948.62]  So that's what we're going to see
[2948.62 --> 2949.86]  in our passage this morning,
[2950.34 --> 2955.04]  what Paul says about living wide awake to God,
[2955.90 --> 2959.14]  and then what we need in order to live like this,
[2959.18 --> 2961.12]  which is to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[2962.90 --> 2965.06]  So we're just going to work through this passage,
[2965.66 --> 2967.04]  kind of verse by verse.
[2967.04 --> 2971.80]  So first, Paul starts off here talking about wisdom.
[2972.46 --> 2972.82]  Wisdom.
[2972.92 --> 2974.88]  In order to be awake, awake to God,
[2974.98 --> 2976.22]  alive to God, alert,
[2976.86 --> 2977.94]  we need wisdom.
[2978.70 --> 2980.28]  And we need to be careful how we live.
[2980.34 --> 2981.86]  Are we careful how we live?
[2982.72 --> 2984.34]  So look what it says in verse 15.
[2984.44 --> 2984.74]  He says,
[2984.86 --> 2986.00]  Be very careful then,
[2986.78 --> 2987.88]  how you live,
[2988.40 --> 2990.02]  not as unwise,
[2990.94 --> 2992.00]  but as wise.
[2992.00 --> 2994.82]  There are many people in this world
[2994.82 --> 2996.76]  who are very intelligent.
[2997.14 --> 2998.50]  They're very educated.
[2998.62 --> 2999.86]  They might have PhDs.
[3000.66 --> 3003.90]  But it doesn't mean everyone is wise.
[3004.88 --> 3008.32]  There still needs to be wisdom for how we live.
[3009.16 --> 3011.80]  Then what is this wisdom that Paul is talking about?
[3012.54 --> 3015.46]  Well, Proverbs 1 describes the fear of the Lord
[3015.46 --> 3017.58]  as the beginning of wisdom.
[3018.46 --> 3019.16]  In the scriptures,
[3019.38 --> 3020.24]  the fear of the Lord
[3020.24 --> 3022.32]  is not talking about just being afraid of God,
[3022.80 --> 3025.34]  though when sinners face a holy God,
[3025.38 --> 3028.52]  that is absolutely part of that experience.
[3029.50 --> 3032.12]  But fear in the Bible is often described
[3032.12 --> 3036.22]  as reverence and worship of God.
[3036.92 --> 3040.50]  It's seeing God rightly as he truly is,
[3040.98 --> 3042.70]  like standing in awe of him
[3042.70 --> 3045.86]  and also yet being delighted in him
[3045.86 --> 3046.98]  and trusting in him.
[3047.58 --> 3050.92]  Of seeing God and his work in the world
[3050.92 --> 3053.78]  and our right place and orientation to God.
[3055.26 --> 3056.62]  That's the fear of the Lord.
[3056.80 --> 3058.36]  And then the writer of Proverbs says,
[3058.60 --> 3059.58]  this fear of the Lord,
[3059.96 --> 3061.90]  having this right perspective of God,
[3062.52 --> 3064.30]  is the beginning of wisdom.
[3065.28 --> 3066.28]  And what he means is
[3066.28 --> 3068.88]  that we can't live our lives rightly in this world
[3068.88 --> 3070.96]  apart from that perspective.
[3071.94 --> 3073.54]  God has made us for himself.
[3073.74 --> 3074.78]  He has created us.
[3075.06 --> 3076.22]  He's created this whole world.
[3076.22 --> 3077.56]  He has put us in this world.
[3078.56 --> 3081.36]  And to live in this world wisely
[3081.36 --> 3085.20]  is to live with that perspective
[3085.20 --> 3087.42]  of awe and reverence
[3087.42 --> 3089.66]  and trust and belief in God.
[3090.50 --> 3092.30]  He's made us to delight in him
[3092.30 --> 3093.20]  and to know him.
[3093.72 --> 3094.38]  To know him.
[3094.50 --> 3097.38]  Not to know about him,
[3097.38 --> 3100.72]  but to know him.
[3100.72 --> 3103.98]  And that's why in verse 17,
[3104.22 --> 3105.08]  Paul says this,
[3105.66 --> 3107.20]  therefore, do not be foolish,
[3108.04 --> 3111.24]  but understand what the Lord's will is.
[3111.96 --> 3114.80]  There's wisdom and there's foolishness.
[3115.72 --> 3117.70]  Wisdom is knowing God,
[3118.34 --> 3119.80]  living in reference to him.
[3120.04 --> 3122.86]  Foolishness is not understanding who God is
[3122.86 --> 3124.24]  and not knowing the Lord's will.
[3125.90 --> 3126.72]  Now, Paul here,
[3126.84 --> 3127.20]  he's not,
[3127.38 --> 3128.50]  when he says that,
[3129.06 --> 3131.86]  he's not talking about the hidden will of God.
[3132.70 --> 3134.36]  Theologians make this distinction
[3134.36 --> 3135.68]  between the hidden will of God
[3135.68 --> 3137.06]  and the revealed will of God.
[3137.68 --> 3139.70]  Paul's not talking about the hidden will of God.
[3139.78 --> 3141.32]  We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[3141.32 --> 3144.00]  He doesn't tell us that.
[3144.78 --> 3148.16]  But we can know God's revealed will.
[3149.34 --> 3151.56]  And we don't have to go up on a mountaintop
[3151.56 --> 3154.14]  and meditate to get some mystical experience
[3154.14 --> 3155.78]  to know what God's will is.
[3156.64 --> 3160.40]  I want to bring us to Deuteronomy 29, verse 29.
[3160.74 --> 3161.96]  Deuteronomy 29, 29.
[3162.62 --> 3164.00]  Look at what it says here.
[3165.08 --> 3168.16]  The secret things belong to the Lord our God,
[3168.16 --> 3171.66]  but the things revealed belong to us
[3171.66 --> 3172.88]  and to our children forever,
[3173.22 --> 3176.50]  that we may follow all the words of this law.
[3177.20 --> 3179.66]  See, God has actually given us his will for us.
[3179.70 --> 3180.42]  He's told us.
[3180.82 --> 3182.26]  And it's right here in the scriptures,
[3182.42 --> 3183.20]  in the word of God.
[3183.38 --> 3185.30]  He tells us what he wants from us.
[3186.22 --> 3188.74]  And so the way you come to know the will of the Lord,
[3188.84 --> 3189.74]  as Paul says here,
[3190.06 --> 3191.58]  is to do two things.
[3192.16 --> 3194.24]  To do these two things a lot.
[3194.30 --> 3195.00]  You know what they are.
[3195.00 --> 3200.12]  Prayer and reading the Bible.
[3201.18 --> 3201.26]  Right?
[3202.56 --> 3206.48]  My daughter Gabby went to visit her cousin
[3206.48 --> 3207.52]  in the U.S. this summer.
[3207.96 --> 3209.06]  Her cousin's name is Mary.
[3209.66 --> 3212.92]  And they got to reconnect after a long time
[3212.92 --> 3214.30]  of we live here on the West Coast,
[3214.40 --> 3215.34]  they live on the East Coast.
[3216.12 --> 3217.60]  And so after their summer visit,
[3217.74 --> 3220.50]  they come home and they've started writing letters
[3220.50 --> 3221.24]  to each other.
[3221.62 --> 3222.24]  It's very cute.
[3222.24 --> 3224.98]  So they write this letter about what's going on in their day,
[3225.12 --> 3225.92]  ask a question,
[3226.16 --> 3227.64]  draw some stars and hearts,
[3228.44 --> 3230.60]  and then put it, you know,
[3230.66 --> 3232.60]  in an envelope and address it herself.
[3232.72 --> 3233.52]  Gabby does it herself.
[3233.66 --> 3235.60]  And then it kind of sits on the desk for a week
[3235.60 --> 3238.92]  until she begs me to take it to the post office.
[3238.98 --> 3239.54]  I finally do.
[3240.08 --> 3242.16]  And so I'm sending these letters to the U.S.,
[3242.16 --> 3242.98]  three bucks a shot,
[3243.36 --> 3244.82]  but it's okay.
[3245.64 --> 3247.10]  And she'll get the letter back
[3247.10 --> 3247.66]  and it's all, you know,
[3247.66 --> 3248.28]  it's very short,
[3248.34 --> 3249.74]  but they've got this correspondence going
[3249.74 --> 3251.28]  and they can keep up this relationship.
[3251.84 --> 3253.48]  Now, and I know this is kind of very simple
[3253.48 --> 3254.86]  kind of illustration,
[3255.42 --> 3257.30]  but if you understand it this way,
[3257.40 --> 3258.40]  then that's okay.
[3260.04 --> 3262.36]  The Bible is God's letter to us.
[3263.78 --> 3267.52]  Our prayers are our letters back to him.
[3268.36 --> 3270.44]  And you want to keep the correspondence going.
[3270.82 --> 3271.80]  Both are necessary.
[3272.48 --> 3272.60]  Right?
[3272.64 --> 3274.96]  You've got to keep talking to the Lord in prayer
[3274.96 --> 3277.66]  and reading what he says to you in his word.
[3278.72 --> 3281.70]  Because wisdom doesn't actually just come in the mail.
[3282.00 --> 3282.18]  Right?
[3282.20 --> 3284.18]  You can't order wisdom from Amazon.
[3284.96 --> 3287.72]  This is something that, as James says,
[3287.72 --> 3289.26]  you can ask God for.
[3290.02 --> 3291.22]  Ask the Lord for wisdom
[3291.22 --> 3293.48]  and he will give it to you.
[3294.22 --> 3295.32]  And it's something, though, also,
[3295.44 --> 3297.12]  that God works in our lives
[3297.12 --> 3299.84]  over time as we come to know God,
[3300.10 --> 3302.00]  to know who he is,
[3302.08 --> 3303.02]  to know what he does,
[3303.10 --> 3304.44]  the way he reacts to things,
[3304.54 --> 3305.44]  to know God,
[3306.32 --> 3308.72]  and then to live according to that in our lives.
[3309.32 --> 3309.66]  To know.
[3309.74 --> 3311.94]  We know God because we have this relationship with him.
[3311.98 --> 3312.90]  We know what God thinks.
[3312.98 --> 3314.60]  We know how he would react to things.
[3314.90 --> 3316.38]  We know what he wants of us.
[3316.84 --> 3318.10]  And then we live accordingly.
[3318.10 --> 3319.12]  We act accordingly.
[3319.28 --> 3319.98]  We think accordingly.
[3320.80 --> 3322.34]  That's the wisdom of God.
[3323.78 --> 3325.96]  So next, Paul talks about one way
[3325.96 --> 3329.42]  we apply wisdom in our daily lives.
[3329.88 --> 3332.16]  So let's look at verse 16 here.
[3333.82 --> 3334.16]  It says,
[3334.28 --> 3335.66]  Be very careful, then,
[3335.72 --> 3336.76]  how you live,
[3336.84 --> 3338.86]  not as unwise but as wise,
[3339.68 --> 3343.22]  making the most of every opportunity
[3343.22 --> 3345.82]  because the days are evil.
[3345.82 --> 3350.30]  So the first place where we see the wisdom of God,
[3350.38 --> 3350.52]  then,
[3350.54 --> 3352.42]  is how we spend our time.
[3353.70 --> 3354.92]  Earlier in Ephesians,
[3355.04 --> 3356.26]  Paul talked about how
[3356.26 --> 3358.94]  we were gods
[3358.94 --> 3361.58]  before the foundation of the world.
[3362.54 --> 3362.78]  Right?
[3362.84 --> 3364.42]  He chose us in Christ,
[3364.66 --> 3367.06]  but we were born in sin and darkness,
[3367.06 --> 3369.18]  so he redeemed us to himself.
[3369.30 --> 3370.82]  He bought us back at the cross,
[3370.90 --> 3372.60]  and now we belong to him,
[3372.60 --> 3374.44]  and we are in his service.
[3374.92 --> 3376.22]  That's kind of what the first part
[3376.22 --> 3377.14]  of Ephesians was about.
[3378.10 --> 3379.24]  And now time
[3379.24 --> 3380.96]  is one of the things
[3380.96 --> 3381.92]  that God has given us
[3381.92 --> 3383.74]  in which to live out our lives with him.
[3384.46 --> 3385.56]  He's given us time.
[3387.18 --> 3388.48]  One of my favorite movies
[3388.48 --> 3390.94]  is called The Dead Poets Society.
[3392.08 --> 3393.38]  And my wife won't watch it with me,
[3393.66 --> 3395.14]  but it's one of my favorite movies.
[3396.54 --> 3397.56]  Who has seen it?
[3397.62 --> 3398.48]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[3398.88 --> 3400.10]  Okay, a couple of you have seen it.
[3400.74 --> 3401.28]  It's an older movie.
[3401.28 --> 3401.78]  You've seen it.
[3402.00 --> 3402.26]  Awesome.
[3403.14 --> 3403.50]  All right.
[3403.94 --> 3405.08]  So, in the movie,
[3405.56 --> 3408.02]  Mr. Keating is the new English teacher.
[3409.10 --> 3411.28]  And in what is one of the best scenes
[3411.28 --> 3411.98]  in cinematic,
[3412.68 --> 3414.26]  cinemagraphic history,
[3414.82 --> 3416.52]  he teaches the class
[3416.52 --> 3417.60]  the Latin phrase,
[3417.76 --> 3418.38]  carpe diem.
[3419.26 --> 3419.82]  What's that mean?
[3420.86 --> 3421.68]  Seize the day.
[3422.10 --> 3422.82]  So you've seen the movie,
[3423.00 --> 3423.64]  or you know Latin.
[3424.20 --> 3424.34]  Okay.
[3425.46 --> 3426.46]  And to do that,
[3426.52 --> 3427.96]  he has the class read
[3427.96 --> 3429.78]  this first part of a poem.
[3429.78 --> 3431.24]  It's not great poetry,
[3431.56 --> 3433.16]  but he makes the point.
[3434.08 --> 3435.14]  So this is what the poem says.
[3435.64 --> 3437.50]  Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
[3437.98 --> 3439.50]  old time is still a-flying,
[3440.18 --> 3442.42]  and this same flower that smiles today,
[3443.08 --> 3445.14]  tomorrow will be dying.
[3446.60 --> 3448.90]  Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
[3449.56 --> 3450.30]  carpe diem,
[3450.64 --> 3451.26]  seize the day.
[3451.26 --> 3454.34]  That is what Paul is saying here.
[3455.70 --> 3457.88]  Be careful how you live,
[3457.96 --> 3458.86]  not as unwise,
[3458.94 --> 3459.52]  but as wise,
[3459.68 --> 3462.28]  making the most of every opportunity.
[3463.38 --> 3464.06]  Paul is saying,
[3464.36 --> 3465.04]  carpe diem.
[3466.20 --> 3468.14]  Jesus Christ says to you and me,
[3468.40 --> 3470.12]  you've only got 24 hours a day.
[3471.12 --> 3473.96]  Make it count for my kingdom.
[3475.06 --> 3475.30]  Right?
[3475.36 --> 3478.24]  All of us know the fairy tale Cinderella.
[3478.24 --> 3478.68]  Kids,
[3478.78 --> 3479.74]  do you know Cinderella?
[3480.14 --> 3482.18]  Maybe you've seen the Disney movie.
[3482.54 --> 3484.72]  What happens in the Disney movie in Cinderella?
[3485.70 --> 3486.30]  Cinderella,
[3486.68 --> 3488.72]  she's mopping the floor,
[3488.86 --> 3489.42]  she's cleaning,
[3489.62 --> 3490.84]  but then she gets this opportunity
[3490.84 --> 3492.82]  to go to the palace,
[3492.90 --> 3493.10]  right?
[3493.50 --> 3495.32]  And her fairy godmother comes,
[3495.46 --> 3496.80]  and she waves her wand,
[3496.94 --> 3499.16]  and Cinderella's now wearing a beautiful dress,
[3499.18 --> 3501.86]  and she gets to go to the party at the palace.
[3501.86 --> 3505.04]  But only until when?
[3506.66 --> 3507.26]  Midnight.
[3509.34 --> 3511.58]  And so she dances with the prince,
[3512.02 --> 3514.50]  but the clock's about to strike 12.
[3514.94 --> 3516.28]  Time's running out.
[3516.34 --> 3517.52]  Is she going to make it back
[3517.52 --> 3520.06]  before her carriage turns into a pumpkin?
[3522.16 --> 3525.52]  See, God wants us to live every moment of our day
[3525.52 --> 3526.44]  that way,
[3526.86 --> 3526.98]  right?
[3527.04 --> 3528.04]  That expectantly.
[3528.04 --> 3531.34]  That your life is about to strike 12.
[3532.82 --> 3536.06]  That thing that God has put on your heart to do
[3536.06 --> 3537.84]  that you haven't done yet,
[3537.92 --> 3539.22]  that is about to strike 12.
[3540.20 --> 3542.32]  Your relationship with your children
[3542.32 --> 3543.74]  or your grandchildren
[3543.74 --> 3545.70]  is about to strike 12.
[3547.16 --> 3548.78]  There's not much time left.
[3549.34 --> 3552.46]  You have the opportunity right now
[3552.46 --> 3554.86]  to heal that relationship.
[3554.86 --> 3557.74]  And Jesus is saying,
[3559.04 --> 3560.88]  make use of it.
[3562.06 --> 3563.06]  Seize the day.
[3563.50 --> 3565.16]  Make most of every opportunity.
[3568.82 --> 3570.22]  That's part of living
[3570.22 --> 3573.30]  according to the wisdom of God.
[3574.22 --> 3575.48]  We belong to him.
[3575.54 --> 3576.74]  He's given us this life.
[3577.32 --> 3578.72]  He's given us our marching orders
[3578.72 --> 3580.10]  before he sent it into heaven.
[3580.20 --> 3580.38]  He said,
[3580.56 --> 3582.18]  go and make disciples of all the nations,
[3582.64 --> 3584.04]  baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[3584.04 --> 3584.86]  Son, and Holy Spirit,
[3585.26 --> 3586.56]  teaching them to obey everything
[3586.56 --> 3587.46]  I've commanded you.
[3587.94 --> 3588.80]  So every day,
[3588.88 --> 3589.80]  whatever we do,
[3590.14 --> 3592.32]  part of our orientation to our lives
[3592.32 --> 3594.54]  ought to be somehow connected with that.
[3594.62 --> 3596.80]  How are we pointing people to Jesus?
[3596.98 --> 3598.78]  How are we making disciples?
[3600.08 --> 3601.74]  We do that in all kinds of ways.
[3603.68 --> 3604.66]  So that's wisdom.
[3605.00 --> 3607.08]  Now, let's go on
[3607.08 --> 3608.94]  and we're going to see
[3608.94 --> 3610.92]  the thing that we need
[3610.92 --> 3612.66]  to live our lives
[3612.66 --> 3613.30]  in this way.
[3613.40 --> 3614.52]  Being a wide awake to God,
[3614.64 --> 3615.48]  alert to God,
[3615.66 --> 3617.06]  being careful how we live,
[3617.32 --> 3618.86]  making the most of every opportunity.
[3620.26 --> 3621.70]  Not dulled, right?
[3621.76 --> 3622.42]  Not unaware.
[3623.74 --> 3624.20]  So now,
[3624.28 --> 3625.70]  let's look at verse 18.
[3627.92 --> 3628.92]  He says then,
[3629.10 --> 3629.74]  Paul says,
[3629.88 --> 3631.14]  do not get drunk with wine,
[3631.30 --> 3632.52]  which leads to debauchery.
[3632.70 --> 3633.06]  Instead,
[3633.34 --> 3634.46]  be filled with the Spirit.
[3635.30 --> 3635.90]  Okay, now,
[3636.20 --> 3638.04]  let's spend some time on this.
[3638.04 --> 3640.68]  Because there's a lot of misunderstanding
[3640.68 --> 3643.66]  about the Spirit-filled life.
[3643.78 --> 3644.74]  What's he talking about?
[3644.82 --> 3645.72]  Filled with the Spirit.
[3647.04 --> 3647.44]  You know,
[3647.48 --> 3648.02]  we may ask,
[3648.12 --> 3648.90]  when Paul says,
[3649.22 --> 3650.06]  be filled with the Spirit,
[3650.16 --> 3650.60]  we might say,
[3650.68 --> 3650.80]  well,
[3650.88 --> 3651.72]  what is that?
[3651.78 --> 3652.62]  What does that mean?
[3653.60 --> 3653.96]  Well,
[3654.06 --> 3654.94]  first of all,
[3655.24 --> 3656.18]  the Holy Spirit,
[3657.62 --> 3658.50]  if you don't know,
[3659.06 --> 3660.42]  is God himself.
[3661.32 --> 3661.46]  Okay?
[3661.58 --> 3663.06]  The Bible tells us
[3663.06 --> 3664.82]  that there's one God
[3664.82 --> 3666.98]  who exists eternally
[3666.98 --> 3667.92]  in three persons,
[3668.04 --> 3668.24]  Father,
[3668.40 --> 3668.54]  Son,
[3668.58 --> 3669.22]  and Holy Spirit.
[3669.80 --> 3671.08]  And all three persons
[3671.08 --> 3671.76]  of the Trinity
[3671.76 --> 3674.32]  are involved in our salvation.
[3675.20 --> 3676.34]  The Father is the one
[3676.34 --> 3677.12]  who plans
[3677.12 --> 3678.56]  and chooses us
[3678.56 --> 3679.24]  for salvation.
[3680.06 --> 3681.28]  The Son is the one
[3681.28 --> 3681.80]  who comes
[3681.80 --> 3682.74]  and accomplishes
[3682.74 --> 3683.52]  our salvation.
[3684.26 --> 3684.86]  He came
[3684.86 --> 3685.90]  and lived a life on earth.
[3686.02 --> 3686.98]  He died on the cross,
[3687.36 --> 3688.56]  rose again on the third day,
[3688.68 --> 3689.58]  ascended into heaven.
[3689.58 --> 3692.20]  But the Spirit
[3692.20 --> 3692.74]  is the one
[3692.74 --> 3693.82]  who then comes,
[3695.02 --> 3695.94]  who applies
[3695.94 --> 3697.82]  all that Jesus accomplished
[3697.82 --> 3698.56]  in his death
[3698.56 --> 3699.16]  and resurrection
[3699.16 --> 3701.40]  to our hearts.
[3701.98 --> 3702.32]  Right?
[3702.38 --> 3702.96]  The Holy Spirit
[3702.96 --> 3703.94]  is the one who comes
[3703.94 --> 3704.84]  when we were dead
[3704.84 --> 3705.76]  in sins.
[3706.26 --> 3706.92]  He comes
[3706.92 --> 3707.76]  into our hearts,
[3707.86 --> 3708.74]  makes us alive
[3708.74 --> 3709.40]  in him,
[3710.12 --> 3711.34]  makes our hearts
[3711.34 --> 3712.24]  alive to God,
[3712.66 --> 3713.40]  so that we then
[3713.40 --> 3714.12]  turn to him
[3714.12 --> 3715.10]  in saving faith
[3715.10 --> 3716.52]  and we can be aware
[3716.52 --> 3717.22]  and we can look
[3717.22 --> 3718.12]  and know God.
[3718.12 --> 3720.08]  And then he works
[3720.08 --> 3720.46]  in us
[3720.46 --> 3721.32]  to bear the fruit
[3721.32 --> 3721.70]  of God
[3721.70 --> 3722.34]  in our lives.
[3722.44 --> 3723.20]  This is the Spirit.
[3724.46 --> 3725.06]  And that means
[3725.06 --> 3725.64]  that everyone
[3725.64 --> 3726.72]  who is a Christian
[3726.72 --> 3729.06]  has the Holy Spirit.
[3730.42 --> 3730.62]  Okay?
[3730.68 --> 3731.26]  That's good news.
[3731.64 --> 3732.42]  If you are a Christian,
[3732.66 --> 3733.36]  if you are united
[3733.36 --> 3734.22]  to Christ by faith,
[3734.28 --> 3735.28]  you have the Holy Spirit
[3735.28 --> 3735.80]  of God
[3735.80 --> 3736.92]  living in you.
[3737.38 --> 3738.20]  So Paul says
[3738.20 --> 3739.08]  in earlier
[3739.08 --> 3740.12]  in chapter 1
[3740.12 --> 3740.80]  in Ephesians,
[3741.40 --> 3741.74]  he says,
[3741.86 --> 3742.72]  when you believed,
[3742.82 --> 3744.02]  when you believed,
[3744.36 --> 3745.02]  you were,
[3745.20 --> 3745.80]  at that time,
[3745.94 --> 3746.88]  marked in him
[3746.88 --> 3747.60]  with a seal,
[3747.60 --> 3748.98]  the promised Holy Spirit.
[3749.64 --> 3750.04]  So again,
[3750.12 --> 3750.80]  if you're a Christian,
[3751.06 --> 3752.26]  if you believe in Christ,
[3752.36 --> 3753.18]  if you are united
[3753.18 --> 3753.98]  to him by faith,
[3754.60 --> 3756.16]  you already have
[3756.16 --> 3756.94]  the Holy Spirit
[3756.94 --> 3757.94]  dwelling within you.
[3758.46 --> 3760.08]  God is living within you.
[3760.70 --> 3761.84]  He's always there.
[3763.72 --> 3765.34]  He's not going to shrink
[3765.34 --> 3766.62]  or become weak
[3766.62 --> 3767.42]  or something like that.
[3767.50 --> 3768.24]  He is there.
[3768.68 --> 3769.78]  You can grieve him,
[3770.68 --> 3772.30]  you can sin against him,
[3772.30 --> 3774.50]  but he's not going anywhere.
[3774.50 --> 3775.90]  Now,
[3775.96 --> 3776.62]  the second thing
[3776.62 --> 3777.00]  we know
[3777.00 --> 3777.86]  about the Holy Spirit
[3777.86 --> 3779.52]  is that he also works
[3779.52 --> 3780.78]  in the Christian's life
[3780.78 --> 3782.58]  to help us experience
[3782.58 --> 3783.82]  communion with God,
[3784.08 --> 3785.10]  to communion with him.
[3785.82 --> 3786.96]  So look at what Paul says
[3786.96 --> 3787.84]  in Romans 5.
[3789.14 --> 3790.00]  God's love
[3790.00 --> 3790.90]  has been poured out
[3790.90 --> 3791.82]  into our hearts
[3791.82 --> 3793.12]  through the Holy Spirit
[3793.12 --> 3795.36]  who has been given to us.
[3796.40 --> 3796.48]  Right?
[3796.54 --> 3798.08]  So through God's Spirit,
[3798.64 --> 3800.34]  we come face to face
[3800.34 --> 3802.16]  with God's love for us.
[3802.16 --> 3803.94]  And we come to know
[3803.94 --> 3805.28]  that we are loved by him.
[3806.32 --> 3807.52]  And it's not unusual
[3807.52 --> 3810.10]  for experiences like this
[3810.10 --> 3811.54]  to be quite emotional.
[3812.26 --> 3813.20]  Where sometimes
[3813.20 --> 3814.62]  in the Christian life,
[3814.72 --> 3816.30]  maybe at various points,
[3816.86 --> 3818.80]  we experience something
[3818.80 --> 3821.36]  of God's love for us
[3821.36 --> 3823.32]  in a special way.
[3825.40 --> 3826.76]  I'll give you an example.
[3827.08 --> 3827.92]  Blaise Pascal
[3827.92 --> 3830.28]  was a brilliant philosopher.
[3830.28 --> 3831.74]  He was a mathematician.
[3832.38 --> 3833.58]  He was an inventor.
[3833.72 --> 3834.52]  At the age of 10,
[3834.56 --> 3836.00]  he was doing new experiments
[3836.00 --> 3836.50]  in physics
[3836.50 --> 3837.40]  that have never been done.
[3838.08 --> 3839.28]  So it'll make you feel
[3839.28 --> 3840.30]  better about your life.
[3842.66 --> 3844.20]  But he had this experience
[3844.20 --> 3845.12]  of God's love.
[3846.10 --> 3847.36]  So this is what he wrote
[3847.36 --> 3848.50]  in his private journal.
[3849.82 --> 3851.30]  The year of grace,
[3851.92 --> 3853.12]  1654,
[3854.02 --> 3854.62]  Monday,
[3855.22 --> 3856.30]  23 November.
[3856.30 --> 3858.84]  from about half past 10
[3858.84 --> 3859.48]  in the evening
[3859.48 --> 3862.22]  until about half past 12,
[3863.40 --> 3863.96]  fire.
[3865.22 --> 3866.40]  God of Abraham,
[3866.66 --> 3867.42]  God of Isaac,
[3867.64 --> 3868.40]  God of Jacob,
[3868.88 --> 3869.82]  not of the philosophers
[3869.82 --> 3870.70]  and of the learned.
[3871.20 --> 3871.82]  Certitude,
[3872.34 --> 3873.02]  certitude,
[3873.30 --> 3873.68]  feeling,
[3873.94 --> 3874.26]  joy,
[3874.80 --> 3875.28]  peace.
[3876.14 --> 3877.34]  God of Jesus Christ,
[3877.76 --> 3878.34]  my God
[3878.34 --> 3879.14]  and your God.
[3879.70 --> 3880.24]  Forgetfulness
[3880.24 --> 3880.96]  of the world
[3880.96 --> 3881.64]  and of everything
[3881.64 --> 3882.66]  except God.
[3883.26 --> 3884.70]  Grandeur of the human soul.
[3884.70 --> 3886.74]  This is eternal life
[3886.74 --> 3888.56]  that they know you,
[3889.02 --> 3890.12]  the one true God
[3890.12 --> 3891.12]  and the one
[3891.12 --> 3891.72]  that you sent,
[3891.84 --> 3892.48]  Jesus Christ.
[3893.32 --> 3894.66]  Let me never be separated
[3894.66 --> 3895.28]  from him.
[3895.88 --> 3896.66]  Renunciation,
[3897.48 --> 3897.90]  total
[3897.90 --> 3899.42]  and sweet.
[3900.46 --> 3901.16]  And it goes on.
[3901.66 --> 3902.32]  That's the part.
[3904.70 --> 3906.34]  That's quite a quiet time.
[3907.24 --> 3907.44]  Right?
[3907.64 --> 3908.06]  I don't know
[3908.06 --> 3909.70]  if your quiet time
[3909.70 --> 3910.56]  was like that.
[3910.56 --> 3913.00]  But Pascal
[3913.00 --> 3914.62]  then sewed
[3914.62 --> 3916.02]  this journal entry
[3916.02 --> 3916.70]  on the parchment.
[3916.90 --> 3917.78]  He sewed it inside
[3917.78 --> 3918.38]  of his coat
[3918.38 --> 3919.78]  that he wore everywhere.
[3920.58 --> 3921.70]  Now why would he do that?
[3922.84 --> 3923.60]  Probably because
[3923.60 --> 3924.22]  that wasn't his
[3924.22 --> 3925.34]  normal quiet time either,
[3925.44 --> 3925.66]  right?
[3926.10 --> 3927.44]  Because Christians
[3927.44 --> 3928.54]  do not often live
[3928.54 --> 3929.48]  in this constant
[3929.48 --> 3930.84]  state of emotion.
[3931.84 --> 3932.70]  But sometimes
[3932.70 --> 3934.38]  we get this experience
[3934.38 --> 3935.58]  of God's love for us.
[3935.58 --> 3938.06]  And we have to
[3938.06 --> 3939.06]  sometimes go back
[3939.06 --> 3940.24]  to those moments
[3940.24 --> 3940.82]  to remember
[3940.82 --> 3942.06]  how God met you.
[3942.80 --> 3943.82]  To kind of rekindle
[3943.82 --> 3944.42]  what the Spirit
[3944.42 --> 3945.52]  has begun
[3945.52 --> 3946.28]  in our hearts.
[3947.24 --> 3947.92]  So sometimes
[3947.92 --> 3948.48]  we can know
[3948.48 --> 3949.28]  God's love for us
[3949.28 --> 3950.18]  in that way.
[3951.56 --> 3952.94]  But the third thing
[3952.94 --> 3953.96]  about the Holy Spirit
[3953.96 --> 3955.44]  is what Paul tells us
[3955.44 --> 3956.34]  here in Ephesians 5.
[3957.06 --> 3957.96]  Which is
[3957.96 --> 3959.08]  just the very
[3959.08 --> 3959.76]  ordinary
[3959.76 --> 3961.24]  life of being
[3961.24 --> 3962.48]  filled with the Spirit.
[3962.48 --> 3963.90]  This is the abiding
[3963.90 --> 3964.74]  character
[3964.74 --> 3966.42]  of the Christian life.
[3967.74 --> 3969.06]  So Martin Lloyd-Jones
[3969.06 --> 3970.18]  was a famous
[3970.18 --> 3971.34]  Welsh pastor
[3971.34 --> 3972.38]  from many years ago.
[3972.64 --> 3973.70]  He was also a physician.
[3973.86 --> 3974.26]  He was a very
[3974.26 --> 3975.44]  able medical doctor.
[3976.18 --> 3977.18]  And as a pastor
[3977.18 --> 3978.56]  he was explaining
[3978.56 --> 3979.26]  this passage
[3979.26 --> 3980.26]  in a very helpful way.
[3980.44 --> 3981.50]  Contrasting wine
[3981.50 --> 3982.86]  and the Spirit.
[3983.52 --> 3983.64]  Right?
[3983.70 --> 3985.18]  Being intoxicated
[3985.18 --> 3985.94]  with alcohol
[3985.94 --> 3988.06]  versus being intoxicated
[3988.06 --> 3989.54]  with the Spirit of God.
[3990.64 --> 3991.24]  And so
[3991.24 --> 3992.64]  Martin Lloyd-Jones
[3992.64 --> 3993.06]  explained
[3993.06 --> 3993.62]  well there are
[3993.62 --> 3994.70]  two kinds of drugs.
[3995.84 --> 3997.06]  There are depressants
[3997.06 --> 3998.94]  and there are stimulants.
[3999.76 --> 4001.08]  What depressants do
[4001.08 --> 4002.10]  is they dull you
[4002.10 --> 4002.86]  to reality
[4002.86 --> 4004.62]  whereas stimulants
[4004.62 --> 4005.42]  make you more aware
[4005.42 --> 4006.56]  and tune into reality.
[4007.72 --> 4008.54]  Now we know
[4008.54 --> 4009.70]  that too much wine
[4009.70 --> 4011.14]  acts as a depressant.
[4011.24 --> 4012.50]  It dulls our senses.
[4013.58 --> 4014.22]  It's a way of
[4014.22 --> 4014.56]  sort of
[4014.56 --> 4015.58]  checking out
[4015.58 --> 4016.50]  from the way
[4016.50 --> 4017.42]  that things are.
[4018.14 --> 4018.92]  But in contrast
[4018.92 --> 4019.62]  to that
[4019.62 --> 4020.96]  the Spirit of God
[4020.96 --> 4021.78]  when He's at work
[4021.78 --> 4022.28]  in our hearts
[4022.28 --> 4022.72]  and minds
[4022.72 --> 4023.66]  is going to make us
[4023.66 --> 4024.44]  more aware.
[4025.22 --> 4026.12]  Increasingly aware
[4026.12 --> 4026.98]  of reality
[4026.98 --> 4028.44]  as reality is.
[4029.86 --> 4030.14]  And so
[4030.14 --> 4031.02]  just as
[4031.02 --> 4031.96]  a drunk person
[4031.96 --> 4032.78]  is controlled
[4032.78 --> 4033.70]  by the wine
[4033.70 --> 4034.36]  in him
[4034.36 --> 4035.06]  or in her
[4035.06 --> 4036.30]  a Christian
[4036.30 --> 4037.76]  is controlled
[4037.76 --> 4038.56]  in the same way
[4038.56 --> 4039.42]  by the Holy Spirit.
[4039.84 --> 4039.94]  Right?
[4039.98 --> 4040.78]  That's what he's saying here.
[4041.50 --> 4042.36]  Don't be filled
[4042.36 --> 4042.94]  with wine
[4042.94 --> 4044.28]  be Spirit filled.
[4045.08 --> 4045.94]  Don't be controlled
[4045.94 --> 4046.44]  by alcohol
[4046.44 --> 4047.08]  be controlled
[4047.08 --> 4047.92]  by the Holy Spirit.
[4048.44 --> 4049.00]  Don't be
[4049.00 --> 4050.20]  kind of dulled
[4050.20 --> 4050.72]  and checked out
[4050.72 --> 4051.16]  of life
[4051.16 --> 4051.96]  just like Paul's
[4051.96 --> 4052.74]  been saying here.
[4053.14 --> 4053.58]  Unaware
[4053.58 --> 4055.28]  but be aware
[4055.28 --> 4056.26]  be stimulated
[4056.26 --> 4056.96]  by the Spirit.
[4058.58 --> 4059.92]  And if you do a study
[4059.92 --> 4060.80]  on the Holy Spirit
[4060.80 --> 4061.30]  in the Bible
[4061.30 --> 4062.24]  soon you will find
[4062.24 --> 4063.34]  that the chief purpose
[4063.34 --> 4064.48]  of the Holy Spirit
[4064.48 --> 4065.04]  the mission
[4065.04 --> 4065.80]  of the Holy Spirit
[4065.80 --> 4067.44]  is that of a matchmaker.
[4068.82 --> 4069.84]  A matchmaker
[4069.84 --> 4070.92]  to bring Jesus
[4070.92 --> 4071.62]  to us
[4071.62 --> 4073.30]  and to bring us
[4073.30 --> 4074.24]  to Jesus.
[4074.24 --> 4076.24]  The Holy Spirit
[4076.24 --> 4076.88]  helps us
[4076.88 --> 4078.26]  to glorify Jesus
[4078.26 --> 4080.00]  and to enlarge
[4080.00 --> 4081.50]  our affections
[4081.50 --> 4082.66]  for Jesus.
[4084.40 --> 4086.16]  Whereas wine here
[4086.16 --> 4087.06]  on the other hand
[4087.06 --> 4088.10]  is representative
[4088.10 --> 4090.08]  of anything
[4090.08 --> 4091.24]  not just wine
[4091.24 --> 4092.12]  it's representative
[4092.12 --> 4093.00]  of anything
[4093.00 --> 4094.10]  that has the potential
[4094.10 --> 4095.22]  to dull
[4095.22 --> 4096.26]  or distract
[4096.26 --> 4097.14]  our hearts
[4097.14 --> 4097.92]  away
[4097.92 --> 4099.18]  from Jesus
[4099.18 --> 4101.08]  from our true north
[4101.08 --> 4103.02]  from the beauty
[4103.02 --> 4103.60]  of our life
[4103.60 --> 4104.14]  with him.
[4107.30 --> 4108.04]  But here's
[4108.04 --> 4108.68]  the tricky part
[4108.68 --> 4111.16]  God created wine
[4111.16 --> 4112.82]  right?
[4112.92 --> 4113.74]  God made wine
[4113.74 --> 4114.24]  God
[4114.24 --> 4115.50]  he means for us
[4115.50 --> 4116.30]  to enjoy it.
[4117.02 --> 4117.92]  Paul says to Timothy
[4117.92 --> 4118.86]  take some wine
[4118.86 --> 4119.56]  for your stomach.
[4120.68 --> 4121.38]  Proverbs says
[4121.38 --> 4122.24]  wine gladdens
[4122.24 --> 4122.64]  the heart
[4122.64 --> 4123.38]  that's a good thing.
[4124.44 --> 4125.78]  In John chapter 2
[4125.78 --> 4126.92]  the first public miracle
[4126.92 --> 4127.76]  that Jesus did
[4127.76 --> 4129.02]  was to make
[4129.02 --> 4130.76]  the best wine
[4130.76 --> 4131.88]  anybody has ever tasted
[4131.88 --> 4133.42]  an abundance of it
[4133.42 --> 4134.36]  for a party
[4134.36 --> 4135.50]  that he was a part of.
[4136.14 --> 4137.42]  So it's not wine
[4137.42 --> 4138.52]  itself
[4138.52 --> 4139.86]  that is an evil.
[4141.02 --> 4142.12]  But what's true
[4142.12 --> 4142.62]  of wine
[4142.62 --> 4143.28]  can be true
[4143.28 --> 4143.74]  of
[4143.74 --> 4145.16]  a career
[4145.16 --> 4148.38]  of food
[4148.38 --> 4150.58]  or of money
[4150.58 --> 4152.48]  or of sex
[4152.48 --> 4154.78]  or of my children
[4154.78 --> 4155.96]  or grandchildren
[4155.96 --> 4157.00]  being okay
[4157.00 --> 4160.10]  of having a happy marriage.
[4160.10 --> 4161.02]  right?
[4161.08 --> 4161.52]  These things
[4161.52 --> 4162.14]  can dull
[4162.14 --> 4162.94]  our hearts
[4162.94 --> 4163.58]  to our life
[4163.58 --> 4164.26]  with Jesus.
[4165.26 --> 4166.02]  They're lovely
[4166.02 --> 4166.92]  pointers
[4166.92 --> 4168.98]  to the goodness
[4168.98 --> 4169.62]  of God
[4169.62 --> 4170.58]  but they should
[4170.58 --> 4171.10]  never be
[4171.10 --> 4171.78]  the point.
[4173.12 --> 4173.70]  That's why
[4173.70 --> 4174.18]  at the beginning
[4174.18 --> 4175.04]  of the Song of Solomon
[4175.04 --> 4175.40]  it says
[4175.40 --> 4176.14]  God's love
[4176.14 --> 4176.66]  is better
[4176.66 --> 4177.22]  than wine.
[4179.68 --> 4180.32]  And this
[4180.32 --> 4180.60]  friends
[4180.60 --> 4181.18]  is what it means
[4181.18 --> 4181.68]  to be filled
[4181.68 --> 4182.36]  with the Holy Spirit.
[4182.44 --> 4183.16]  It's not dramatic
[4183.16 --> 4183.74]  it's not
[4183.74 --> 4184.70]  jumping up
[4184.70 --> 4185.48]  and singing
[4185.48 --> 4186.52]  well we'll get to singing
[4186.52 --> 4187.32]  but it's not like
[4187.32 --> 4188.40]  going crazy
[4188.40 --> 4189.82]  but it says
[4189.82 --> 4191.14]  be continually filled
[4191.14 --> 4192.44]  that's the verb tense here.
[4192.76 --> 4193.86]  It's this present tense
[4193.86 --> 4194.56]  it's this idea
[4194.56 --> 4196.82]  of this ongoing reality
[4196.82 --> 4198.40]  abiding with Christ
[4198.40 --> 4199.76]  having God's spirit
[4199.76 --> 4200.78]  at work in our hearts
[4200.78 --> 4201.68]  so that we walk
[4201.68 --> 4202.36]  in his love
[4202.36 --> 4203.52]  we bear his fruit
[4203.52 --> 4204.30]  in our lives
[4204.30 --> 4206.02]  we keep in step
[4206.02 --> 4206.68]  with the spirit.
[4208.58 --> 4209.52]  So that's what it means
[4209.52 --> 4210.40]  to have this spirit
[4210.40 --> 4211.04]  filled life.
[4211.14 --> 4211.62]  It's just the
[4211.62 --> 4213.48]  ordinary life
[4213.48 --> 4214.30]  of the Christian.
[4214.44 --> 4215.20]  You have the spirit
[4215.20 --> 4215.66]  in you
[4215.66 --> 4218.90]  and he controls you
[4218.90 --> 4220.14]  he controls your actions
[4220.14 --> 4221.18]  he makes you aware
[4221.18 --> 4223.04]  of Jesus especially
[4223.04 --> 4224.46]  where you're
[4224.46 --> 4225.62]  you're trusting in him
[4225.62 --> 4226.82]  you're believing in him
[4226.82 --> 4227.74]  and everything else
[4227.74 --> 4229.28]  has their rightful place
[4229.28 --> 4230.74]  as God's good gifts to us.
[4231.42 --> 4232.30]  Now the last thing
[4232.30 --> 4233.02]  I want us to look at
[4233.02 --> 4233.44]  this morning
[4233.44 --> 4234.58]  is next
[4234.58 --> 4235.58]  what Paul talks about
[4235.58 --> 4237.22]  he goes on to say
[4237.22 --> 4238.00]  two things
[4238.00 --> 4238.84]  about being filled
[4238.84 --> 4239.50]  with the spirit.
[4240.60 --> 4241.08]  There are at least
[4241.08 --> 4241.88]  two activities
[4241.88 --> 4243.06]  that Paul says
[4243.06 --> 4244.22]  that we should do
[4244.22 --> 4244.86]  if we're filled
[4244.86 --> 4245.40]  with the spirit.
[4246.20 --> 4247.10]  Now we don't have time
[4247.10 --> 4248.24]  to look at these in detail
[4248.24 --> 4249.54]  but as we close
[4249.54 --> 4250.52]  let's consider them
[4250.52 --> 4251.14]  briefly.
[4251.70 --> 4253.16]  The first is singing.
[4253.94 --> 4254.84]  In verse 19
[4254.84 --> 4255.54]  Paul says
[4255.54 --> 4257.18]  so do not get drunk
[4257.18 --> 4257.58]  with wine
[4257.58 --> 4258.18]  but be filled
[4258.18 --> 4259.02]  with the spirit
[4259.02 --> 4260.20]  that filled with the spirit
[4260.20 --> 4261.18]  is the main verb
[4261.18 --> 4262.38]  and then it says
[4262.38 --> 4263.60]  speaking to one another
[4263.60 --> 4265.22]  with psalms, hymns
[4265.22 --> 4266.14]  and songs from the spirit
[4266.14 --> 4267.94]  singing and making music
[4267.94 --> 4269.36]  from your heart
[4269.36 --> 4270.62]  to the Lord.
[4272.12 --> 4273.30]  Two things to say
[4273.30 --> 4274.16]  here straight away.
[4274.16 --> 4276.34]  it's with your heart
[4276.34 --> 4278.42]  to one another.
[4279.70 --> 4280.76]  Sing with your heart
[4280.76 --> 4282.00]  to one another.
[4282.60 --> 4283.14]  Don't be drunk
[4283.14 --> 4283.70]  with wine
[4283.70 --> 4284.84]  but be filled
[4284.84 --> 4285.46]  with the spirit
[4285.46 --> 4287.16]  and sing.
[4288.10 --> 4288.80]  Like what?
[4289.04 --> 4289.74]  Who would have
[4289.74 --> 4290.26]  thought of that?
[4291.14 --> 4291.28]  Right?
[4291.32 --> 4291.62]  Be filled
[4291.62 --> 4292.06]  with the spirit.
[4292.54 --> 4292.78]  Sing.
[4294.32 --> 4295.28]  Now it's kind
[4295.28 --> 4295.70]  of interesting
[4295.70 --> 4296.86]  when you think
[4296.86 --> 4297.76]  about drunk people
[4297.76 --> 4298.32]  which hopefully
[4298.32 --> 4299.22]  we don't do often
[4299.22 --> 4300.44]  but in your mind
[4300.44 --> 4302.64]  you might think
[4302.64 --> 4303.28]  well drunk people
[4303.28 --> 4303.78]  what do they do?
[4305.50 --> 4306.42]  They sing a lot
[4306.42 --> 4306.80]  don't they?
[4308.20 --> 4308.90]  That's part of
[4308.90 --> 4309.68]  what we think of
[4309.68 --> 4310.28]  when we think about
[4310.28 --> 4311.38]  people being drunk
[4311.38 --> 4312.64]  but here Paul is saying
[4312.64 --> 4315.10]  sing in a spiritual way.
[4316.04 --> 4317.08]  Spend time as a group
[4317.08 --> 4318.02]  and sing together.
[4318.02 --> 4322.88]  Sorry someone keeps
[4322.88 --> 4324.64]  texting me
[4324.64 --> 4325.28]  so I have to keep
[4325.28 --> 4326.58]  it's distracting.
[4330.10 --> 4330.54]  Yeah.
[4331.36 --> 4332.34]  And also I think
[4332.34 --> 4333.00]  this is interesting.
[4334.30 --> 4335.34]  It's not like
[4335.34 --> 4337.34]  don't have fun
[4337.34 --> 4339.12]  but be really serious.
[4339.26 --> 4340.04]  That's not what it says.
[4340.64 --> 4341.36]  It's not don't get drunk
[4341.36 --> 4342.32]  but be spirit filled
[4342.32 --> 4343.24]  and now we're very serious.
[4343.72 --> 4344.42]  That's not what
[4344.42 --> 4345.40]  the spirit filled life
[4345.40 --> 4345.96]  is all about.
[4345.96 --> 4347.20]  Rather it's a different
[4347.20 --> 4348.20]  kind of celebration.
[4348.44 --> 4349.24]  It's a different kind
[4349.24 --> 4349.58]  of joy.
[4349.70 --> 4350.38]  It's true joy.
[4350.76 --> 4351.50]  Sing together
[4351.50 --> 4353.68]  but sing psalms
[4353.68 --> 4354.22]  and hymns
[4354.22 --> 4355.32]  and spiritual songs
[4355.32 --> 4356.54]  not drinking songs.
[4357.42 --> 4358.80]  We as a people of Christ
[4358.80 --> 4360.00]  ought to sing together.
[4360.38 --> 4361.00]  We ought to sing
[4361.00 --> 4362.00]  the songs of Zion.
[4362.76 --> 4363.80]  Singing about God
[4363.80 --> 4364.72]  about Jesus
[4364.72 --> 4365.86]  about what he has done
[4365.86 --> 4366.46]  for us.
[4367.76 --> 4368.46]  Paul says
[4368.46 --> 4369.38]  this is one of the ways
[4369.38 --> 4370.02]  we are to be filled
[4370.02 --> 4370.62]  with the spirit.
[4371.32 --> 4372.42]  A second way
[4372.42 --> 4373.00]  to be filled
[4373.00 --> 4373.54]  with the spirit
[4373.54 --> 4375.18]  is to give thanks.
[4375.18 --> 4375.98]  That's the second thing
[4375.98 --> 4376.42]  Paul says.
[4376.42 --> 4377.88]  Always giving thanks
[4377.88 --> 4378.80]  to God the Father
[4378.80 --> 4379.82]  for everything
[4379.82 --> 4381.06]  in the name
[4381.06 --> 4382.80]  of our Lord
[4382.80 --> 4383.76]  Jesus Christ.
[4384.74 --> 4386.02]  So when we gather
[4386.02 --> 4387.40]  together as Christians
[4387.40 --> 4389.32]  we need to use
[4389.32 --> 4389.92]  this occasion
[4389.92 --> 4390.60]  to give thanks
[4390.60 --> 4391.12]  to God.
[4391.60 --> 4392.96]  To remind ourselves
[4392.96 --> 4394.10]  of all the good things
[4394.10 --> 4394.72]  that God has done
[4394.72 --> 4395.18]  for us.
[4395.38 --> 4396.66]  To encourage one another
[4396.66 --> 4397.54]  to live a life
[4397.54 --> 4398.82]  of thanksgiving.
[4400.26 --> 4401.10]  And Paul says
[4401.10 --> 4401.76]  that this should be
[4401.76 --> 4403.22]  a perpetual posture.
[4403.90 --> 4406.22]  Always giving thanks
[4406.22 --> 4407.38]  to the Father
[4407.38 --> 4407.98]  for what?
[4410.64 --> 4411.16]  Everything.
[4412.22 --> 4412.70]  Everything.
[4413.52 --> 4414.20]  It's similar
[4414.20 --> 4415.18]  to when Paul says
[4415.18 --> 4416.88]  pray without ceasing.
[4417.58 --> 4418.10]  Now obviously
[4418.10 --> 4418.56]  you're not going to be
[4418.56 --> 4419.32]  going around saying
[4419.32 --> 4420.00]  thank you,
[4420.10 --> 4420.46]  thank you,
[4420.56 --> 4420.90]  thank you,
[4420.98 --> 4421.32]  thank you.
[4421.40 --> 4422.18]  That's not what it means.
[4422.88 --> 4423.90]  The point is
[4423.90 --> 4424.92]  your life should be
[4424.92 --> 4426.56]  a life of thankfulness.
[4427.22 --> 4428.52]  Where you're always
[4428.52 --> 4429.76]  giving thanks to God.
[4429.76 --> 4430.92]  Instead of grumbling,
[4431.14 --> 4431.92]  instead of complaining,
[4432.60 --> 4433.14]  be thanking.
[4434.28 --> 4435.44]  So being spirit-filled
[4435.44 --> 4436.20]  means we should be
[4436.20 --> 4437.16]  a thankful people.
[4438.90 --> 4440.06]  So we are to live
[4440.06 --> 4440.90]  carefully.
[4442.00 --> 4442.88]  We are to live
[4442.88 --> 4443.62]  in the spirit,
[4444.50 --> 4444.76]  singing
[4444.76 --> 4446.10]  and giving thanks.
[4446.94 --> 4448.06]  And as we do so,
[4448.66 --> 4449.42]  we will be awake
[4449.42 --> 4449.90]  to God.
[4450.50 --> 4451.22]  And we will make
[4451.22 --> 4452.06]  the most of every
[4452.06 --> 4452.66]  opportunity,
[4452.86 --> 4453.80]  doing God's will,
[4454.34 --> 4455.24]  and we will glorify
[4455.24 --> 4455.96]  the name of our
[4455.96 --> 4456.80]  Lord Jesus Christ.
[4457.36 --> 4457.92]  Let's pray.
[4460.72 --> 4461.20]  Father,
[4461.30 --> 4461.86]  we thank you
[4461.86 --> 4463.90]  for this picture
[4463.90 --> 4464.86]  of what you have
[4464.86 --> 4466.12]  called us to
[4466.12 --> 4467.18]  in this Christian life.
[4467.78 --> 4468.12]  Lord,
[4468.18 --> 4469.12]  you have united us
[4469.12 --> 4470.02]  to yourself
[4470.02 --> 4470.70]  through faith.
[4471.14 --> 4472.08]  You have united us
[4472.08 --> 4472.78]  to one another
[4472.78 --> 4473.60]  as your body
[4473.60 --> 4474.30]  in the church.
[4474.86 --> 4476.08]  And then you teach us
[4476.08 --> 4477.46]  how are we to live.
[4478.66 --> 4479.62]  We are to be filled
[4479.62 --> 4480.34]  with the spirit,
[4480.90 --> 4481.22]  singing
[4481.22 --> 4482.74]  to one another,
[4483.74 --> 4484.30]  ministering
[4484.30 --> 4484.92]  to one another,
[4485.08 --> 4486.28]  encouraging one another,
[4486.56 --> 4487.26]  being thankful
[4487.26 --> 4488.24]  for all things.
[4488.24 --> 4489.18]  Lord,
[4489.26 --> 4490.14]  this is your will
[4490.14 --> 4490.56]  to us
[4490.56 --> 4491.42]  that you have revealed.
[4492.78 --> 4493.24]  Father,
[4493.38 --> 4494.02]  would we be
[4494.02 --> 4495.22]  spirit-filled Christians,
[4496.58 --> 4497.96]  constantly keeping
[4497.96 --> 4499.18]  in step with the spirit,
[4499.52 --> 4500.96]  knowing the will
[4500.96 --> 4502.18]  of God,
[4502.52 --> 4503.14]  our Father,
[4503.28 --> 4504.40]  and his love for us
[4504.40 --> 4505.24]  through Jesus Christ.
[4505.84 --> 4507.40]  We pray in his holy name.
[4507.78 --> 4508.02]  Amen.
[4509.60 --> 4510.14]  All right,
[4510.18 --> 4510.64]  let's stand
[4510.64 --> 4511.10]  and let's sing
[4511.10 --> 4511.94]  our song of response
[4511.94 --> 4512.22]  together.
[4512.70 --> 4512.78]  Amen.
[4512.78 --> 4512.86]  Amen.
[4512.86 --> 4512.90]  Amen.
[4512.90 --> 4512.96]  Amen.
[4512.96 --> 4513.30]  Amen.
[4513.30 --> 4513.36]  Amen.
[4513.36 --> 4513.86]  Amen.
[4518.24 --> 4518.60]  Amen.
[4531.44 --> 4531.58]  Amen.
[4531.98 --> 4532.22]  Amen.
[4532.22 --> 4532.86]  Amen.
[4532.86 --> 4534.08]  Amen.
[4534.08 --> 4534.52]  Amen.
[4535.14 --> 4535.24]  Amen.
[4535.24 --> 4536.32]  Amen.
[4536.32 --> 4537.22]  Amen.
[4537.22 --> 4538.02]  Amen.
[4538.02 --> 4538.64]  Amen.
[4539.00 --> 4539.32]  Amen.
[4539.32 --> 4540.02]  Amen.
[4540.30 --> 4541.18]  Amen.
[4541.18 --> 4541.42]  Amen.
[4541.42 --> 4542.06]  Amen.
[4542.06 --> 4542.10]  Amen.
[4542.10 --> 4542.30]  Amen.
[4542.30 --> 4542.86]  Amen.
[4543.76 --> 4543.90]  Amen.
[4543.90 --> 4544.50]  Amen.
[4544.50 --> 4545.32]  Amen.
[4545.56 --> 4545.82]  Amen.
[4545.82 --> 4546.52]  Amen.
[4547.04 --> 4548.06]  Amen.
[4548.06 --> 4560.52]  And all things now living, a song of thanksgiving, to God the Creator triumphantly raised.
[4560.52 --> 4573.90]  Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us, who still guides us on to the end of our days.
[4573.90 --> 4587.70]  His matters all for us, His light goes before us, the pillar of fire shining forth in the light.
[4588.10 --> 4601.26]  Till shadows have vanished, and darkness is banished, as forward we travel from light into light.
[4601.26 --> 4616.70]  His light enforces the stars in their courses, the sun in His orbit obediently shine.
[4616.70 --> 4629.70]  The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains, the deeps of the ocean proclaim Him behind.
[4630.76 --> 4644.70]  We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing, with that adoration a song that has raised.
[4644.70 --> 4659.70]  Dear all things now living, united thanksgiving, to God in the highest, Hosanna and praise.
[4659.70 --> 4667.92]  Go ahead and be seated.
[4672.92 --> 4675.26]  Would you please join me in prayer?
[4676.04 --> 4686.08]  We pray now this prayer of supplication, lifting up all of our needs, our requests to a God who hears us, knows us, and who listens.
[4686.30 --> 4687.02]  Let's pray together.
[4687.02 --> 4698.64]  Father, our holy God, we come before you this morning, and we acknowledge that we have so, so much to be grateful for.
[4699.78 --> 4703.40]  Lord, we're grateful that you have made us.
[4704.48 --> 4708.48]  When there was no obligation in you to have done so,
[4708.48 --> 4716.76]  we are grateful that you, even in eternity past, covenanted within yourself, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[4717.50 --> 4722.42]  knowing full well that we would stray from you, you covenanted to redeem us.
[4723.24 --> 4727.96]  You planned to send your Son to enter into our brokenness.
[4728.82 --> 4730.70]  Father, we are grateful to you.
[4730.70 --> 4737.62]  We're grateful that you have not abandoned us as we would truly deserve.
[4739.14 --> 4742.78]  We are grateful to live in a part of the world where we have so much,
[4743.64 --> 4745.84]  where you have given in great abundance.
[4745.84 --> 4755.54]  Most of us today are not wondering where our food will come from or our security when we go home today.
[4755.54 --> 4766.54]  So we are grateful also, Lord, that you are with us, that we have your Spirit in those of us who have trusted in you.
[4766.54 --> 4775.58]  We are grateful that you have given us all that we need, your Word says, for life and for godliness.
[4776.48 --> 4781.74]  At the same time, Lord, we think of those today in our world who perhaps are struggling to be thankful.
[4782.50 --> 4790.66]  We lift up those who are trying to find some semblance of normalcy amidst the floods in Pakistan,
[4792.30 --> 4794.86]  amidst the war that continues in Ukraine.
[4794.86 --> 4799.94]  Or those who are trying to deal with an Ebola outbreak in Uganda.
[4802.22 --> 4808.74]  Lord, and we think of the people in Iran and their ongoing struggle for religious freedom and freedom from oppression.
[4810.08 --> 4811.84]  Lord, continue to shepherd your people.
[4813.42 --> 4817.92]  We pray today for people who have been impacted also by storms and weather.
[4817.92 --> 4827.52]  We pray for safety and recovery for those in Atlantic Canada who are continuing to face the damage and the fallout from Hurricane Fiona.
[4828.40 --> 4834.28]  May your people in that region band together to serve their communities in the midst of these challenges.
[4834.28 --> 4843.90]  Lord, there are so many around the world right now who are probably having a hard time seeing your provision.
[4843.90 --> 4848.46]  And yet we know that you are in those places as well.
[4849.26 --> 4851.92]  And that you are willing to provide for those people.
[4852.92 --> 4854.06]  We pray that you will.
[4854.54 --> 4857.38]  And that your church would be part of that provision.
[4857.38 --> 4865.76]  We pray for those in our own community who are struggling in different ways, going through difficult times, maybe even this week.
[4865.76 --> 4872.62]  We thank you, Lord, that Scott is out of the hospital and that the infection in his leg is clearing up.
[4873.30 --> 4875.34]  We pray that you would bless his recovery.
[4876.40 --> 4880.06]  And would you be present with that family during this difficult time?
[4881.62 --> 4883.44]  We pray for others who are sick.
[4884.40 --> 4885.72]  For those who are lonely.
[4886.50 --> 4889.34]  And those who are struggling in a variety of ways.
[4889.34 --> 4894.96]  Lord, also we especially pray for Ali today who is having some sickness.
[4896.88 --> 4900.68]  Lord, we pray for all who need you.
[4900.84 --> 4905.10]  That they would lift up their eyes to you.
[4905.32 --> 4907.48]  To see that you are good and that you care for them.
[4908.52 --> 4914.04]  And we ask that you would help us to be vulnerable with one another.
[4914.18 --> 4916.58]  To share those needs and not to be ashamed of them.
[4916.58 --> 4919.48]  So that we might come alongside one another.
[4919.84 --> 4923.84]  Meeting each other's needs as your spirit works through us.
[4924.92 --> 4929.54]  We thank you, Lord, that we can bring these concerns and all of our needs before you.
[4930.46 --> 4933.62]  And know that we can entrust them to your care.
[4934.40 --> 4936.72]  God, we give you ourselves today.
[4937.20 --> 4940.28]  Would you give us hearts of thanksgiving.
[4941.12 --> 4944.14]  We thank you that you are always with us by the spirit.
[4944.70 --> 4946.22]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4946.78 --> 4947.14]  Amen.
[4949.20 --> 4950.14]  Friends, let's stand.
[4950.96 --> 4954.52]  And we go with God's blessing upon us.
[4954.58 --> 4956.14]  His word over us.
[4957.04 --> 4962.36]  I invite you to first join us in a time of fellowship right after the service in the foyer.
[4962.94 --> 4964.84]  And as we go and before we sing.
[4964.96 --> 4966.96]  And hold out your hands if you want.
[4967.74 --> 4970.66]  As a gesture of receiving the blessing of your Heavenly Father.
[4970.66 --> 4979.04]  May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had.
[4979.78 --> 4986.88]  So that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4986.88 --> 4988.26]  And all God's people said.
[4988.26 --> 4989.38]  Amen.
[4989.38 --> 4989.50]  Amen.
[4989.50 --> 4995.70]  Three ok things line, then all our you may bless you.
[4995.70 --> 4996.70]  Amen.
[5025.70 --> 5027.70]  Amen.
[5055.70 --> 5073.62]  O may this God's Son, to all of us be near us, with ever-jornful hearts, and blessed
[5073.62 --> 5088.74]  and pleased to cheer us, and keep us in this place, and guide us when perplexed, and
[5088.74 --> 5099.08]  free us from all ill, in this world and the rest.
[5099.08 --> 5118.46]  Always and thanks to God, the Father now be given, the Son and Him who reigns with
[5118.46 --> 5133.46]  heaven in highest heaven, thou art eternal God, who earth and earth and earth and earth
[5133.46 --> 5145.46]  for us to cause His love, that the hope be evermore.
[5145.46 --> 5146.32]  Amen.
[5147.46 --> 5149.54]  Amen.
[5151.46 --> 5151.90]  Amen.
[5152.46 --> 5154.92]  Amen.
[5154.92 --> 5155.38]  Amen.
[5155.52 --> 5155.88]  Amen.
[5155.88 --> 5185.86]  Thank you.
