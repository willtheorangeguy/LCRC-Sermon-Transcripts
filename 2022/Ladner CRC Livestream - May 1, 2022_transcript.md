[337.98 --> 338.98]  Pastor Lynn Baterink.
[338.98 --> 341.98]  We are glad he can be with us this morning.
[341.98 --> 348.98]  And Pastor Jason is leaving today for his amazing trip, his study trip to Egypt and the
[348.98 --> 349.98]  Holy Land.
[349.98 --> 352.98]  A couple of announcements.
[352.98 --> 357.98]  Congratulations to Tony and Marion on their 50th wedding anniversary.
[357.98 --> 370.98]  And to celebrate this happy occasion they are serving cake after church in the fellowship
[370.98 --> 371.98]  hall this time.
[371.98 --> 374.98]  All the way in the back.
[374.98 --> 384.98]  And also pre-registration is now open for Ladner CRC kids and neighbors for basic skills day
[384.98 --> 385.98]  camp.
[385.98 --> 388.98]  Which is planned for the third week of August.
[388.98 --> 391.98]  And you can sign up on the foyer table.
[391.98 --> 397.98]  And also if you have a skill to share please talk to Jason, Hannah or Marcy.
[397.98 --> 400.98]  They would love to hear from you.
[400.98 --> 403.98]  And one more announcement.
[403.98 --> 409.98]  In your bulletin there is this announcement about Servants Anonymous fundraiser.
[409.98 --> 416.98]  And if you are looking for a way to bless the fearfully and wonderfully made woman in your life for Mother's Day.
[416.98 --> 422.98]  Here is the great opportunity to buy a bloom box.
[422.98 --> 427.98]  And this is available after church in the foyer.
[427.98 --> 433.98]  And of course there is more information in your bulletin.
[433.98 --> 440.98]  And then also our offering for today is for the Diaconal Ministries Program New Ground.
[440.98 --> 444.98]  And your bulletins hold a little card about that.
[444.98 --> 447.98]  It was formally called Operation Manna.
[447.98 --> 453.98]  And New Ground helps churches across Canada reach into their communities to show Christ's love.
[453.98 --> 457.98]  And although we are passing the offering plates now.
[457.98 --> 461.98]  You can still give your offering by dropping it off at the church.
[461.98 --> 463.98]  Placing it at the boxes at the back.
[463.98 --> 466.98]  Or mailing it or giving online.
[466.98 --> 467.98]  So thank you.
[467.98 --> 473.98]  Okay, could you please stand if you are able for the call to worship.
[473.98 --> 483.98]  Okay, please join me for our call to worship from Psalm 100.
[483.98 --> 486.98]  Know that the Lord is God.
[486.98 --> 488.98]  And we are his people.
[488.98 --> 489.98]  His community.
[489.98 --> 491.98]  His family.
[491.98 --> 495.98]  Let us enter his gates with thanksgiving.
[495.98 --> 498.98]  And his courts with praise.
[498.98 --> 501.98]  The Lord greets you this morning.
[501.98 --> 506.98]  From Zephaniah 3 verse 17.
[506.98 --> 509.98]  The Lord your God is with you.
[509.98 --> 512.98]  The mighty warrior who saves.
[512.98 --> 515.98]  He takes great delight in you.
[515.98 --> 519.98]  In his love he will no longer rebuke you.
[519.98 --> 522.98]  But will rejoice over you with singing.
[522.98 --> 526.98]  As God has greeted us, so let us greet each other.
[526.98 --> 531.98]  Amen.
[531.98 --> 536.98]  You may know you will only be restored.
[536.98 --> 546.98]  Now are you?
[546.98 --> 550.98]  Your pastor is пользов entrar, really well friend.
[550.98 --> 552.98]  Let us寂 see us.
[552.98 --> 582.96]  Thank you.
[582.98 --> 612.96]  Thank you.
[612.98 --> 614.98]  Thank you.
[642.98 --> 644.98]  Thank you.
[672.98 --> 674.98]  Thank you.
[702.98 --> 704.98]  Thank you.
[732.98 --> 734.98]  Thank you.
[762.98 --> 764.98]  Thank you.
[792.98 --> 794.98]  Thank you.
[794.98 --> 796.98]  Thank you.
[796.98 --> 798.98]  Thank you.
[824.98 --> 826.98]  Thank you.
[826.98 --> 828.98]  Thank you.
[828.98 --> 830.98]  Thank you.
[858.98 --> 860.98]  Thank you.
[888.98 --> 890.98]  Thank you.
[918.98 --> 920.98]  Thank you.
[948.98 --> 950.98]  Thank you.
[950.98 --> 952.98]  Thank you.
[952.98 --> 977.74]  Jesus, hope of the nations.
[977.74 --> 983.70]  Jesus, comfort for all who are.
[984.24 --> 991.10]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[992.14 --> 995.44]  Jesus, light in the darkness.
[996.60 --> 1000.24]  Jesus, within each circumstance.
[1000.24 --> 1008.12]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1008.70 --> 1012.24]  In history you lived and died.
[1012.94 --> 1018.06]  You brought the chains of the lost to life.
[1018.68 --> 1022.48]  You are the hope living in us.
[1022.88 --> 1026.24]  You are the love in whom we trust.
[1026.24 --> 1034.24]  You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1035.44 --> 1039.62]  He was in love, death, hungry, fear.
[1040.14 --> 1043.24]  Popters of peace, time was near.
[1044.38 --> 1050.24]  Jesus, hope of the Lord living for all who will receive.
[1050.24 --> 1054.24]  Lord, we believe.
[1058.24 --> 1061.94]  Jesus, hope of the nations.
[1063.08 --> 1067.24]  Jesus, comfort for all who are.
[1068.24 --> 1074.24]  You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[1074.24 --> 1079.24]  Jesus, light in the darkness.
[1080.24 --> 1083.82]  Jesus, within each circumstance.
[1084.24 --> 1091.32]  You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[1091.86 --> 1095.24]  In history you lived and died.
[1095.24 --> 1101.24]  You brought the chains that rose to life.
[1101.24 --> 1105.54]  You are the hope living in us.
[1105.54 --> 1109.24]  You are the love in whom we trust.
[1109.24 --> 1116.24]  You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[1116.24 --> 1136.24]  Jesus, Lord, we believe.
[1136.24 --> 1150.30]  Jesus, Lord, we believe.
[1150.78 --> 1153.82]  Jesus, Lord, we believe.
[1158.30 --> 1163.60]  Children ages three to grade seven are welcome to go to Kids Life Sunday School now.
[1163.60 --> 1193.58]  Thank you.
[1193.60 --> 1196.68]  We are going to talk together with these words based on Matthew 22.
[1198.08 --> 1199.84]  Our Lord Jesus said,
[1200.62 --> 1207.40]  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
[1208.14 --> 1212.54]  This is the greatest at first commandment, and a second is like it.
[1213.06 --> 1215.00]  You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[1215.96 --> 1219.24]  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
[1219.24 --> 1227.48]  Because we have not loved the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind,
[1227.82 --> 1236.80]  or loved our neighbor as ourselves, let us confess our sins to God, trusting Christ as our Savior and Lord.
[1236.80 --> 1247.24]  And now God's assurance of pardon and forgiveness of our sin from Psalm 32.
[1247.24 --> 1255.34]  Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
[1256.28 --> 1264.78]  Happy are those to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
[1264.78 --> 1292.36]  There is a kindness in God's mercy, like the wideness of the sea.
[1292.36 --> 1300.96]  There's a kindness in God's justice, which is more than liberty.
[1302.46 --> 1311.56]  There is no place where our sorrows are more valid and not be found.
[1311.56 --> 1321.44]  There is no place where our faith is absent when we judge and give.
[1322.36 --> 1332.92]  The love of God is taller than the measures of the mind.
[1332.92 --> 1342.28]  And the heart of eternal is most wonderfully fine.
[1342.68 --> 1346.30]  Make our love, O God, more faithful.
[1347.18 --> 1351.48]  Let us take you unto God.
[1351.48 --> 1361.56]  And our lives will be thanksgiving for the goodness of the Lord.
[1361.56 --> 1391.54]  Let us take you unto God.
[1391.54 --> 1393.30]  God, you are very great.
[1393.64 --> 1395.86]  You are clothed with splendor and majesty.
[1396.82 --> 1402.46]  The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment, as he stretches out the heavens like a tent,
[1403.02 --> 1406.14]  and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters.
[1406.90 --> 1410.34]  He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
[1410.96 --> 1415.08]  He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.
[1415.08 --> 1417.84]  He sets the earth on its foundations.
[1417.84 --> 1417.88]  He sets the earth on its foundations.
[1417.88 --> 1419.50]  It can never be moved.
[1419.50 --> 1423.04]  You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment.
[1423.72 --> 1425.36]  The waters stood above the mountains.
[1426.00 --> 1427.98]  But at your rebuke the waters fled.
[1428.40 --> 1430.80]  At the sound of your thunder they took to flight.
[1431.34 --> 1432.78]  They flowed over the mountains.
[1432.92 --> 1436.60]  They went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.
[1437.46 --> 1439.82]  You set a boundary they cannot cross.
[1439.82 --> 1442.14]  Never again will they cover the earth.
[1443.24 --> 1446.70]  He makes springs pour water into the ravines.
[1447.12 --> 1448.58]  It flows between the mountains.
[1449.30 --> 1451.66]  They give water to all the beasts of the field.
[1452.28 --> 1454.52]  The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
[1454.52 --> 1458.38]  The birds of the sky nest by the waters.
[1459.26 --> 1460.98]  They sing among the branches.
[1461.78 --> 1464.14]  He waters the mountains from his upper chambers.
[1464.30 --> 1466.94]  The land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
[1467.62 --> 1472.14]  He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for people to cultivate,
[1472.88 --> 1474.62]  bringing forth food from the earth,
[1475.28 --> 1479.02]  wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine,
[1479.42 --> 1481.58]  and bread that sustains their hearts.
[1481.58 --> 1484.62]  The trees of the Lord are well watered,
[1484.62 --> 1486.56]  the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
[1487.40 --> 1489.22]  There the birds make their nests.
[1489.54 --> 1491.56]  The stork has its home in the junipers.
[1492.14 --> 1494.48]  The high mountains belong to the wild goats.
[1494.84 --> 1497.20]  The crags are a refuge for the hyrax.
[1497.96 --> 1499.98]  He made the moon to mark the seasons,
[1500.28 --> 1502.12]  and the sun knows when to go down.
[1502.54 --> 1504.58]  You bring darkness, it becomes night,
[1504.70 --> 1506.96]  and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
[1507.42 --> 1511.40]  The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
[1512.16 --> 1514.46]  The sun rises, and they steal away.
[1515.02 --> 1517.06]  They return and lie down in their dens.
[1517.86 --> 1521.34]  Then people go out to their work, to their labor, until evening.
[1522.24 --> 1524.36]  How many are your works, O Lord?
[1525.00 --> 1526.64]  In wisdom you made them all.
[1527.06 --> 1528.70]  The earth is full of your creatures.
[1529.34 --> 1531.70]  There is the sea, vast and spacious,
[1532.00 --> 1534.36]  teeming with creatures beyond number,
[1535.04 --> 1537.26]  living things both large and small.
[1537.26 --> 1540.04]  There the ships go to and fro,
[1540.54 --> 1542.94]  and Leviathan, which you formed, to frolic there.
[1543.64 --> 1547.12]  All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
[1547.84 --> 1549.82]  When you give it to them, they gather it up.
[1550.16 --> 1553.60]  When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
[1553.60 --> 1556.28]  When you hide your face, they are terrified.
[1556.88 --> 1561.64]  When you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
[1562.52 --> 1564.98]  When you send your spirit, they are created,
[1565.14 --> 1567.30]  and you renew the face of the ground.
[1567.30 --> 1570.46]  May the glory of the Lord endure forever.
[1570.90 --> 1572.82]  May the Lord rejoice in his works.
[1573.40 --> 1575.40]  He who looks at the earth and it trembles,
[1575.46 --> 1577.48]  who touches the mountains and they smoke.
[1578.30 --> 1580.80]  I will sing to the Lord all my life.
[1581.24 --> 1583.96]  I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
[1584.72 --> 1588.82]  May my meditation be pleasing to him as I rejoice in the Lord.
[1589.58 --> 1592.76]  But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more.
[1593.68 --> 1595.06]  Praise the Lord, my soul.
[1595.76 --> 1596.70]  Praise the Lord.
[1597.30 --> 1598.74]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1599.46 --> 1600.46]  Thank you, Lord.
[1612.02 --> 1613.04]  Thank you for that.
[1613.30 --> 1614.26]  Very nicely done.
[1614.84 --> 1615.88]  It was a lot of reading.
[1616.82 --> 1618.32]  But it's a lovely psalm.
[1618.46 --> 1619.20]  One of my favorites.
[1619.72 --> 1622.58]  Now, before we get started, I do note from the bulletin
[1622.58 --> 1627.02]  that Pastor Jason is away on that trip
[1627.02 --> 1629.88]  through Jordan, Egypt, Jordan, and Israel.
[1630.82 --> 1633.66]  And the bulletin also mentions that Mike Coote did it before
[1633.66 --> 1634.90]  as well as Ernst de Vries.
[1635.74 --> 1637.04]  And I know I came the year,
[1637.04 --> 1641.00]  I went the year after Pastor Mike went on that trip.
[1641.00 --> 1645.70]  Because each year they would take some of the new participants
[1645.70 --> 1648.74]  and link them with some of the previous year's participants.
[1649.16 --> 1651.64]  And I was linked with Pastor Mike.
[1651.98 --> 1653.42]  So we were on the phone a bunch.
[1653.48 --> 1654.66]  That's how I got to know him a bit.
[1655.16 --> 1657.44]  But he was very helpful in telling me what to,
[1657.44 --> 1659.96]  how to prepare, what to get ready for.
[1659.96 --> 1663.20]  And what he mentioned most often is get ready for heat.
[1663.60 --> 1667.64]  Because especially Egypt is very, very hot and very dry.
[1668.18 --> 1669.88]  But it's an unforgettable thing.
[1670.14 --> 1671.20]  We saw the pyramids.
[1671.72 --> 1673.18]  We saw the Valley of the Kings.
[1673.68 --> 1675.22]  We rode boats on the Nile.
[1675.88 --> 1679.34]  We saw Petra in Jordan, which is just an amazing place.
[1680.08 --> 1682.22]  But the moment, one moment that really stays with me,
[1682.30 --> 1684.06]  we went to a place called Jerash.
[1684.26 --> 1688.28]  And it's also in Egypt, not far from the Sea of Galilee.
[1688.28 --> 1692.84]  And it was one of the ten cities of the Decapolis,
[1692.96 --> 1697.20]  the ten cities around the Sea of Galilee.
[1698.16 --> 1703.60]  And the New Testament reports that Jesus went through all the cities of the Decapolis.
[1704.46 --> 1705.76]  And Jerash was one of them.
[1705.92 --> 1710.86]  And there's a very well-preserved ruins of that city.
[1711.16 --> 1714.90]  You can walk on the streets that were used 2,000 years ago.
[1714.90 --> 1717.24]  And I remember our leader saying,
[1717.42 --> 1720.80]  it's very likely that Jesus walked on these stones.
[1721.64 --> 1723.66]  And that's when something really struck me.
[1723.74 --> 1727.00]  I felt something happened to me when he said that.
[1727.22 --> 1731.86]  So anyways, we're in Psalm 104, which is a great nature psalm.
[1731.92 --> 1735.68]  I'm just going to reread the first part of verse 24.
[1735.68 --> 1740.38]  How many are your works, O Lord, in wisdom.
[1741.22 --> 1742.62]  You made them all.
[1743.30 --> 1743.98]  Psalm 104.
[1745.02 --> 1752.38]  Okay, in September 1977, NASA, the American Space Agency,
[1752.82 --> 1753.90]  sent up a satellite.
[1754.08 --> 1756.44]  They launched a satellite called Voyager.
[1757.38 --> 1759.86]  It was about the size of a small car.
[1759.86 --> 1765.06]  And it had an antenna dish about four meters across, so really big.
[1766.28 --> 1767.82]  Voyager had a three-year mission.
[1768.62 --> 1774.00]  It was supposed to fly past the planets Jupiter and Saturn.
[1774.92 --> 1775.80]  And it did that.
[1775.84 --> 1777.26]  And it did that very successfully.
[1777.48 --> 1780.74]  It sent back spectacular pictures and lots of data.
[1781.40 --> 1785.00]  It really was a giant leap for planetary science.
[1785.00 --> 1789.36]  Then NASA decided to extend that mission.
[1790.42 --> 1794.02]  So they sent Voyager further into space.
[1794.76 --> 1798.54]  After a while, it crossed the orbit of the planet Uranus.
[1799.30 --> 1804.30]  And sometime after that, it crossed the orbit of the planet Neptune.
[1806.08 --> 1811.72]  And then, 12 years after launch, it crossed the orbit of Pluto.
[1811.72 --> 1818.72]  And then, it flew out into a whole lot of nothing.
[1819.80 --> 1822.06]  Now, out there, there's something called the Kuiper Belt.
[1822.50 --> 1827.68]  It's mostly dwarf planets and rocky objects and lots of ice.
[1828.46 --> 1833.12]  Well, Voyager went through the Kuiper Belt and then on further and further and further.
[1833.46 --> 1839.70]  Today, 45 years after launch, it still has power and should for a few more years.
[1839.70 --> 1842.72]  And it's still sending back data.
[1843.66 --> 1845.30]  It's traveling very, very fast.
[1845.72 --> 1848.96]  About 60,000 kilometers an hour.
[1850.30 --> 1853.10]  And it's flying through a lot of empty space.
[1853.80 --> 1859.14]  If NASA could somehow aim Voyager at the nearest star,
[1860.14 --> 1864.04]  it would arrive there in about 40,000 years.
[1864.04 --> 1868.56]  I mean, space is really, really big.
[1869.84 --> 1874.70]  Now, when Voyager was about as far away as the orbit of Neptune,
[1875.20 --> 1882.72]  the astronomer, Carl Sagan, came up with the idea of taking a picture of the Earth from deep in space.
[1883.44 --> 1885.68]  And NASA went along with that.
[1885.68 --> 1888.98]  They turned their spacecraft around.
[1889.18 --> 1891.00]  They aimed the camera in our direction.
[1891.48 --> 1893.02]  And they took a picture.
[1893.70 --> 1897.24]  And that picture has been called the Pale Blue Dot.
[1897.40 --> 1898.12]  We have it up here.
[1899.60 --> 1902.68]  Now, we did kill the lights before, and that really helped.
[1903.78 --> 1904.54]  Okay, thanks.
[1904.54 --> 1910.04]  This kind of makes you think deep thoughts, doesn't it?
[1910.58 --> 1913.96]  You can only see a little red band across, right?
[1914.74 --> 1916.44]  Okay, now that's not space.
[1916.52 --> 1917.78]  There's nothing like that in space.
[1917.84 --> 1919.86]  It's actually glare off the machine.
[1920.66 --> 1922.92]  So if you just happened to be there somehow,
[1923.68 --> 1925.78]  you would see none of that red band,
[1926.38 --> 1930.40]  but you would see that little point of light in the middle of the band.
[1930.44 --> 1930.90]  Do you see that?
[1930.90 --> 1934.12]  That is the Earth.
[1934.68 --> 1935.54]  That's here.
[1937.50 --> 1939.76]  I mean, it makes you think deep thoughts, doesn't it?
[1940.62 --> 1944.86]  And Carl Sagan, he was a famous public astronomer at the time,
[1944.88 --> 1946.70]  and he had some deep thoughts of his own.
[1947.06 --> 1947.86]  And here's what he said.
[1948.42 --> 1950.62]  He said, from this distant vantage point,
[1950.72 --> 1953.74]  the Earth might not seem of any particular interest,
[1954.62 --> 1956.36]  but for us, it's different.
[1957.00 --> 1959.12]  Look again at that dot.
[1959.86 --> 1960.80]  That's here.
[1961.64 --> 1962.72]  That's home.
[1963.68 --> 1964.48]  That's us.
[1965.12 --> 1967.86]  On this dot, everyone you love,
[1968.40 --> 1969.36]  everyone you know,
[1969.78 --> 1971.26]  everyone you ever heard of,
[1971.62 --> 1973.62]  every human being who ever was,
[1974.04 --> 1975.62]  lived out their lives.
[1976.28 --> 1977.96]  Every hunter and forager,
[1978.36 --> 1979.64]  every hero and coward,
[1980.06 --> 1982.76]  every creator and destroyer of civilization,
[1983.28 --> 1984.74]  every king and peasant,
[1985.26 --> 1986.94]  every young couple in love,
[1987.38 --> 1988.64]  every mother and father,
[1988.64 --> 1989.88]  every hopeful child,
[1989.88 --> 1991.82]  every inventor and explorer,
[1991.82 --> 1993.82]  every teacher of morals,
[1993.82 --> 1995.94]  every corrupt politician,
[1995.94 --> 1998.66]  every superstar and every supreme leader,
[1999.16 --> 2003.02]  every saint and sinner in the history of our species,
[2003.42 --> 2004.16]  lived here,
[2005.16 --> 2007.02]  on a moat of dust,
[2007.70 --> 2010.20]  suspended in a sunbeam.
[2010.20 --> 2012.56]  To my mind,
[2012.56 --> 2013.60]  Carl Sagan said,
[2013.66 --> 2014.34]  to my mind,
[2014.76 --> 2016.94]  there's perhaps no better demonstration
[2016.94 --> 2019.84]  of the folly of human conceits
[2019.84 --> 2024.36]  than this distant image of our tiny world.
[2024.36 --> 2025.82]  To me,
[2025.86 --> 2027.42]  it underscores our responsibility
[2027.42 --> 2029.86]  to do more kindly and compassionately
[2029.86 --> 2030.90]  with one another
[2030.90 --> 2034.10]  and to preserve and cherish
[2034.10 --> 2036.70]  that pale blue dot,
[2037.10 --> 2040.72]  the only home we have ever known.
[2043.32 --> 2044.96]  I mean, deep thoughts, don't you think?
[2044.96 --> 2048.24]  A few years before,
[2048.62 --> 2050.32]  Voyager took that picture
[2050.32 --> 2051.72]  from way out in space,
[2052.42 --> 2053.52]  an Apollo astronaut
[2053.52 --> 2055.38]  took a picture from closer to home.
[2056.28 --> 2058.72]  Apollo 8 was the first of the Apollo missions
[2058.72 --> 2060.96]  to actually travel to the moon.
[2061.10 --> 2062.14]  I mean, they didn't do a landing,
[2062.14 --> 2064.20]  but they orbited for a day or so
[2064.20 --> 2065.70]  and then returned.
[2066.54 --> 2067.32]  And on one of,
[2067.44 --> 2070.22]  when they were coming from the backside of the moon
[2070.22 --> 2071.28]  on one of those orbits,
[2071.28 --> 2075.34]  an astronaut named William Anders
[2075.34 --> 2077.24]  snapped a picture of the earth
[2077.24 --> 2080.38]  coming up above the horizon of the moon.
[2080.46 --> 2081.52]  It's called Earthrise.
[2081.80 --> 2082.56]  Ah, there it is.
[2083.46 --> 2085.14]  I mean, that is an iconic picture.
[2085.24 --> 2086.60]  I would imagine most of you
[2086.60 --> 2087.68]  have seen that before.
[2088.34 --> 2090.50]  And this is our home.
[2091.32 --> 2093.08]  This is where we live
[2093.08 --> 2095.68]  and we'll live all our lives.
[2096.88 --> 2099.48]  We should take care of this earth
[2099.48 --> 2102.64]  because as the saying goes,
[2103.14 --> 2105.54]  good planets are really hard to find.
[2106.64 --> 2109.02]  I mean, the listings are really limited.
[2111.30 --> 2113.16]  And the more you learn about this earth,
[2113.22 --> 2114.14]  the more you realize
[2114.14 --> 2116.94]  that it is an incredibly fascinating place
[2116.94 --> 2119.84]  and in many ways a very unlikely place.
[2121.10 --> 2122.70]  In so many ways,
[2122.84 --> 2124.66]  everything is just right.
[2124.66 --> 2129.96]  The earth is just the right distance from the sun.
[2131.06 --> 2132.32]  If we were a bit closer,
[2133.02 --> 2134.74]  the oceans would boil away
[2134.74 --> 2136.20]  and the earth would be fried.
[2137.10 --> 2139.34]  If it was just a bit further away,
[2140.02 --> 2141.72]  the waters would freeze
[2141.72 --> 2143.00]  and life would be impossible.
[2143.90 --> 2147.62]  They call our particular space in the solar system
[2147.62 --> 2149.78]  the Goldilocks zone.
[2150.46 --> 2151.42]  It's not too hot
[2151.42 --> 2152.92]  and it's not too cold.
[2154.52 --> 2157.46]  Now the earth is wrapped in a thin layer,
[2157.72 --> 2159.34]  only a few kilometers thick,
[2159.82 --> 2162.80]  of earth and air and water.
[2163.24 --> 2166.04]  And that's where life is possible.
[2166.72 --> 2169.22]  That's where blossoms can bloom
[2169.22 --> 2171.48]  and bees can pollinate
[2171.48 --> 2175.16]  and fruit can grow for the country market.
[2175.16 --> 2178.66]  At the center of the earth,
[2178.88 --> 2182.08]  there is a huge heavy metal core,
[2182.40 --> 2183.20]  nickel and iron.
[2184.10 --> 2187.44]  And that huge nickel and iron core,
[2187.68 --> 2188.96]  it actually makes the earth
[2188.96 --> 2190.66]  into a gigantic magnet.
[2191.32 --> 2192.98]  I mean, we live on a big magnet.
[2193.88 --> 2196.96]  And that big magnet protects the earth
[2196.96 --> 2200.14]  because that big magnetic field around the earth
[2200.14 --> 2202.96]  shelters the earth from the cosmic rays
[2202.96 --> 2206.58]  that are flowing from the sun all day long.
[2207.66 --> 2208.74]  And without that,
[2209.14 --> 2211.40]  the cosmic waves would strip the atmosphere
[2211.40 --> 2212.46]  off the earth
[2212.46 --> 2214.42]  and the earth would shrivel
[2214.42 --> 2215.80]  and it would die.
[2217.82 --> 2221.30]  About 70% of the earth is covered by oceans.
[2221.30 --> 2223.64]  And those oceans,
[2223.92 --> 2228.10]  they kind of work like a gigantic heat transfer system.
[2229.04 --> 2230.02]  So at times,
[2230.64 --> 2232.54]  waters from the north,
[2232.64 --> 2233.72]  the Arctic north,
[2233.86 --> 2237.16]  travel south into the tropics.
[2237.50 --> 2239.26]  And that has a cooling effect.
[2241.02 --> 2242.84]  And in other places,
[2243.78 --> 2246.30]  waters from the tropics
[2246.30 --> 2249.58]  flow north into the Arctic areas.
[2249.58 --> 2251.54]  If you wonder why a country like Norway
[2251.54 --> 2253.02]  has open harbors
[2253.02 --> 2254.92]  north of the Arctic circle,
[2255.06 --> 2257.06]  it's because of that warm current
[2257.06 --> 2259.52]  that flows up its coast continually.
[2260.64 --> 2263.24]  So the oceans have the effect
[2263.24 --> 2265.60]  of making the planet more temperate.
[2266.64 --> 2268.50]  And that's better for life.
[2268.50 --> 2272.16]  The earth is tipped
[2272.16 --> 2276.34]  23 degrees off of straight top and bottom.
[2277.18 --> 2278.88]  And at its maximum tilt,
[2279.14 --> 2281.32]  our north is 23 degrees closer.
[2282.08 --> 2284.82]  And when it's on the other side of the sun,
[2285.18 --> 2287.24]  the north is 20 degrees further away.
[2287.80 --> 2288.90]  And so it's colder.
[2289.80 --> 2290.38]  In other words,
[2290.46 --> 2293.28]  the tilt of the earth gives us our seasons,
[2293.60 --> 2294.76]  summer and winter
[2294.76 --> 2296.50]  and springtime and harvest.
[2296.50 --> 2301.04]  That 23 degree tip gives us seasons of bloom
[2301.04 --> 2302.82]  and growing and fruit bearing
[2302.82 --> 2306.06]  and then also seasons of decay
[2306.06 --> 2308.82]  and composting.
[2309.48 --> 2310.72]  I mean, composting didn't begin
[2310.72 --> 2311.86]  with our composting bins.
[2311.98 --> 2313.78]  It was built into the creation.
[2315.86 --> 2317.70]  Now, we can go on like this for the whole day.
[2317.70 --> 2320.12]  Our planet is obviously
[2320.12 --> 2322.32]  an incredibly interesting place.
[2323.40 --> 2326.00]  And the most astounding thing for me
[2326.00 --> 2329.40]  is that thin layer of earth
[2329.40 --> 2330.92]  and air and water,
[2331.06 --> 2333.84]  that thin skin of life,
[2334.42 --> 2336.36]  only a few kilometers thick,
[2336.94 --> 2340.02]  and it's wrapped around the earth.
[2341.06 --> 2344.42]  That is the only place in the universe we know
[2344.42 --> 2347.50]  where life can thrive.
[2349.64 --> 2352.14]  Now, I understand there may be other places
[2352.14 --> 2354.24]  somewhere in space
[2354.24 --> 2355.78]  where life is possible.
[2357.24 --> 2358.96]  In most cases, though,
[2359.04 --> 2361.46]  it would be very primitive life,
[2361.66 --> 2364.22]  microbes that can somehow survive
[2364.22 --> 2365.94]  in extreme conditions.
[2366.04 --> 2368.06]  They call them extremophiles.
[2368.70 --> 2370.38]  And astronomers are investigating.
[2370.38 --> 2373.38]  They even point to a couple of moons
[2373.38 --> 2374.46]  in our solar system.
[2374.56 --> 2376.20]  I think one around Saturn
[2376.20 --> 2377.82]  and maybe one around Jupiter.
[2377.98 --> 2379.26]  They think there may be
[2379.26 --> 2381.74]  some organic things there
[2381.74 --> 2383.70]  that might indicate life.
[2385.00 --> 2385.96]  That said,
[2386.34 --> 2389.34]  there's really nothing close to our planet,
[2389.46 --> 2391.84]  to our pale blue dot.
[2392.60 --> 2394.36]  That's where we can live
[2394.36 --> 2397.56]  and love and grow and thrive.
[2397.56 --> 2399.98]  Our world is fearfully
[2399.98 --> 2402.08]  and wonderfully made.
[2404.12 --> 2406.24]  Now, I like to think of Psalm 104,
[2406.62 --> 2408.32]  which you just heard a few months ago,
[2408.38 --> 2410.58]  as the Old Testament version
[2410.58 --> 2412.92]  of what we just did.
[2413.86 --> 2415.70]  It looks at the earth
[2415.70 --> 2416.40]  and it notices
[2416.40 --> 2418.06]  that everything fits together
[2418.06 --> 2419.58]  and everything works together.
[2419.78 --> 2421.38]  The land, the waters,
[2421.52 --> 2422.72]  the sun, the rains,
[2422.84 --> 2424.44]  the grasses and the forests,
[2424.56 --> 2426.00]  the birds of the air,
[2426.00 --> 2427.76]  and the fish of the sea,
[2428.22 --> 2429.70]  and the land animals,
[2430.30 --> 2434.90]  and people that God created.
[2436.22 --> 2438.90]  And from the very start of this song,
[2439.96 --> 2442.28]  it praises not only the creation,
[2442.54 --> 2444.16]  but also the creator.
[2445.74 --> 2446.74]  We're told that our creator
[2446.74 --> 2447.84]  is very great.
[2448.28 --> 2449.22]  That he is clothed
[2449.22 --> 2450.62]  with splendor and majesty.
[2450.90 --> 2452.70]  That he rides on the clouds
[2452.70 --> 2453.82]  and on the winds.
[2454.74 --> 2457.04]  And through that main part
[2457.04 --> 2457.62]  of the psalm,
[2457.66 --> 2458.70]  then, we're told
[2458.70 --> 2460.98]  how all this world he made
[2460.98 --> 2463.40]  fits and works together.
[2465.04 --> 2466.16]  There's a certain amount
[2466.16 --> 2466.92]  of overlap
[2466.92 --> 2469.12]  between this psalm
[2469.12 --> 2471.80]  and the creation account
[2471.80 --> 2473.18]  at the beginning of the Bible,
[2473.32 --> 2474.02]  Genesis 1.
[2474.76 --> 2476.26]  But it's in a little bit
[2476.26 --> 2477.44]  of a different order.
[2478.62 --> 2479.60]  In Genesis 1,
[2479.60 --> 2480.32]  we see God
[2480.32 --> 2481.40]  like a kind of worker
[2481.40 --> 2484.20]  who puts in a week's work
[2484.20 --> 2487.78]  to build this amazing creation.
[2489.00 --> 2491.14]  He creates the light
[2491.14 --> 2493.78]  and separates darkness
[2493.78 --> 2494.76]  from light.
[2495.56 --> 2498.16]  He separates the waters above
[2498.16 --> 2499.62]  from the waters below.
[2501.28 --> 2504.04]  He separates the land
[2504.04 --> 2505.94]  from the seas.
[2505.94 --> 2508.82]  Then he creates the sun
[2508.82 --> 2509.40]  and the moon
[2509.40 --> 2510.20]  and the stars.
[2511.48 --> 2512.40]  Then he fills
[2512.40 --> 2514.20]  the air with birds
[2514.20 --> 2515.44]  and the sea with fishes.
[2516.54 --> 2517.40]  Then he creates
[2517.40 --> 2518.42]  the land animals.
[2519.38 --> 2520.08]  And finally,
[2520.20 --> 2521.46]  he creates humanity.
[2522.46 --> 2523.32]  In his image
[2523.32 --> 2524.50]  and in his likeness,
[2524.68 --> 2525.78]  male and female,
[2526.24 --> 2527.34]  he created them.
[2529.02 --> 2530.08]  On the other hand,
[2530.30 --> 2530.92]  Psalm 104
[2530.92 --> 2531.98]  is more about
[2531.98 --> 2532.54]  how God
[2532.54 --> 2533.64]  maintains
[2533.64 --> 2535.04]  and sustains
[2535.04 --> 2535.96]  this earth.
[2536.92 --> 2537.94]  How, you know,
[2538.04 --> 2538.84]  it's sort of like
[2538.84 --> 2540.32]  a gardener
[2540.32 --> 2541.72]  planting a garden.
[2542.38 --> 2544.00]  That would be creation,
[2544.44 --> 2545.18]  Genesis 1.
[2545.82 --> 2546.62]  And then think of
[2546.62 --> 2547.22]  a gardener
[2547.22 --> 2548.64]  maintaining the garden.
[2549.02 --> 2549.32]  You know,
[2549.40 --> 2550.60]  watering the soil,
[2550.76 --> 2551.70]  pulling the weeds,
[2551.86 --> 2552.78]  thinning the rows,
[2552.94 --> 2554.02]  making that garden
[2554.02 --> 2555.68]  stay healthy
[2555.68 --> 2556.40]  and productive.
[2556.76 --> 2557.32]  That would be
[2557.32 --> 2558.38]  Psalm 104.
[2558.38 --> 2558.78]  Or,
[2558.94 --> 2561.78]  to put it in
[2561.78 --> 2563.26]  theological terms,
[2564.20 --> 2564.90]  we could think of
[2564.90 --> 2566.18]  Genesis 1
[2566.18 --> 2567.58]  as creation,
[2568.14 --> 2569.12]  Psalm 104
[2569.12 --> 2570.68]  as providence.
[2572.34 --> 2572.90]  So,
[2573.08 --> 2573.76]  they both
[2573.76 --> 2574.56]  tell us
[2574.56 --> 2575.92]  about a creator
[2575.92 --> 2578.50]  who is in this world,
[2578.96 --> 2579.24]  who is,
[2579.58 --> 2580.36]  we can see his
[2580.36 --> 2581.04]  fingerprints
[2581.04 --> 2582.18]  all through it.
[2583.48 --> 2584.32]  In our psalm,
[2584.38 --> 2584.74]  we're told that
[2584.74 --> 2585.60]  God put waters
[2585.60 --> 2586.46]  in their places
[2586.46 --> 2587.58]  and keeps them there.
[2587.76 --> 2588.64]  At your rebuke,
[2588.72 --> 2589.68]  the waters fled,
[2590.16 --> 2590.86]  they flowed
[2590.86 --> 2591.66]  over the mountains,
[2591.80 --> 2592.46]  they went down
[2592.46 --> 2593.12]  into the valleys
[2593.12 --> 2593.74]  to the place
[2593.74 --> 2594.44]  you assigned them,
[2594.48 --> 2595.78]  you set a boundary
[2595.78 --> 2597.02]  where they cannot cross,
[2597.32 --> 2598.26]  never again
[2598.26 --> 2599.04]  will they cover
[2599.04 --> 2599.62]  the earth.
[2601.22 --> 2601.82]  We're told that
[2601.82 --> 2602.30]  he makes,
[2602.68 --> 2603.48]  that the waters
[2603.48 --> 2604.92]  make life thrive,
[2605.38 --> 2606.76]  plants and animals.
[2607.40 --> 2608.82]  He makes springs
[2608.82 --> 2609.74]  pour water
[2609.74 --> 2610.84]  into the ravines,
[2611.32 --> 2612.16]  they give water
[2612.16 --> 2613.46]  to all the beasts
[2613.46 --> 2614.04]  of the field,
[2614.16 --> 2615.20]  the wild donkeys
[2615.20 --> 2616.38]  quench their thirst,
[2616.46 --> 2618.24]  the birds of the sky
[2618.24 --> 2619.98]  nest by the waters,
[2620.38 --> 2621.88]  he waters the mountains
[2621.88 --> 2623.10]  from his upper chambers,
[2623.72 --> 2625.00]  he makes grass grow
[2625.00 --> 2625.74]  for the cattle
[2625.74 --> 2626.44]  and plants
[2626.44 --> 2627.46]  for people to cultivate,
[2628.20 --> 2628.88]  bringing forth
[2628.88 --> 2630.20]  food from the earth,
[2630.62 --> 2631.78]  wine that gladdens
[2631.78 --> 2632.48]  human hearts,
[2632.62 --> 2633.24]  oil to make
[2633.24 --> 2634.26]  their faces shine,
[2634.76 --> 2635.24]  and bread
[2635.24 --> 2636.56]  that sustains
[2636.56 --> 2637.62]  their hearts.
[2640.04 --> 2640.90]  We're told that
[2640.90 --> 2641.80]  God made the moon
[2641.80 --> 2642.92]  mark the seasons,
[2642.92 --> 2644.52]  and that the sun
[2644.52 --> 2645.88]  knows when it
[2645.88 --> 2646.96]  has to go down.
[2647.48 --> 2648.46]  You bring darkness,
[2648.76 --> 2649.58]  it becomes night,
[2649.78 --> 2650.62]  and all the beasts
[2650.62 --> 2651.82]  of the field prowl.
[2652.12 --> 2653.12]  The sun rises,
[2653.36 --> 2654.46]  and they steal away,
[2654.56 --> 2655.26]  they return,
[2655.48 --> 2656.26]  and lie down
[2656.26 --> 2656.98]  in their dens,
[2657.48 --> 2658.28]  and then the people
[2658.28 --> 2659.00]  go out
[2659.00 --> 2660.14]  to labor
[2660.14 --> 2661.54]  until evening.
[2662.48 --> 2663.00]  We're told that
[2663.00 --> 2664.42]  every living thing
[2664.42 --> 2665.80]  depends on the creator.
[2666.18 --> 2667.56]  These all look to you
[2667.56 --> 2668.52]  to give them food
[2668.52 --> 2669.62]  in their proper season.
[2669.62 --> 2670.98]  When you open
[2670.98 --> 2672.46]  your hands,
[2672.86 --> 2673.96]  they are satisfied
[2673.96 --> 2675.94]  with good things.
[2677.54 --> 2678.32]  We learn that
[2678.32 --> 2680.34]  the circle of life
[2680.34 --> 2682.10]  is God's circle.
[2682.42 --> 2683.48]  When you hide your face,
[2683.58 --> 2684.28]  they are terrified.
[2685.02 --> 2685.86]  When you take away
[2685.86 --> 2686.36]  their breath,
[2686.42 --> 2687.00]  they die
[2687.00 --> 2688.58]  and return to the dust.
[2689.00 --> 2689.80]  When you send
[2689.80 --> 2690.56]  your spirit,
[2690.92 --> 2691.84]  they are created,
[2692.14 --> 2693.02]  and you renew
[2693.02 --> 2694.88]  the face of the earth.
[2696.28 --> 2697.86]  So all through this psalm,
[2697.86 --> 2698.74]  the creator
[2698.74 --> 2700.22]  and the creation
[2700.22 --> 2702.72]  are all bound together.
[2702.92 --> 2705.12]  All nature fits together
[2705.12 --> 2706.30]  to support their life,
[2707.02 --> 2708.66]  and this is a sign
[2708.66 --> 2710.62]  of the creator's care
[2710.62 --> 2711.28]  and keeping.
[2712.28 --> 2713.06]  What we have here
[2713.06 --> 2714.42]  is a kind of a hymn
[2714.42 --> 2716.14]  and a kind of a prayer
[2716.14 --> 2717.58]  woven together
[2717.58 --> 2718.60]  to celebrate
[2718.60 --> 2720.28]  what God has done
[2720.28 --> 2721.84]  in this creation
[2721.84 --> 2723.10]  and what he continues
[2723.10 --> 2723.82]  to do
[2723.82 --> 2725.14]  in this creation.
[2725.14 --> 2727.38]  How many are your works,
[2727.50 --> 2727.94]  O Lord?
[2728.14 --> 2729.04]  In wisdom,
[2729.52 --> 2730.86]  you made them all.
[2730.96 --> 2732.04]  The whole earth
[2732.04 --> 2732.88]  is filled with
[2732.88 --> 2734.38]  your creatures.
[2737.84 --> 2738.46]  You know,
[2738.48 --> 2739.30]  one of the confessions
[2739.30 --> 2740.14]  of our church,
[2740.80 --> 2741.80]  one of the basic
[2741.80 --> 2742.94]  statements of faith
[2742.94 --> 2745.12]  that we hold together,
[2745.56 --> 2746.04]  it's called
[2746.04 --> 2747.48]  the Belgic Confession.
[2748.48 --> 2750.48]  And in the second article
[2750.48 --> 2751.72]  of the Belgic Confession,
[2752.20 --> 2752.82]  we're told
[2752.82 --> 2755.10]  how we know God.
[2756.10 --> 2756.66]  And there are,
[2756.94 --> 2757.38]  we're told
[2757.38 --> 2758.06]  there are two ways.
[2758.14 --> 2758.74]  We know God
[2758.74 --> 2759.74]  by two means.
[2760.44 --> 2760.74]  First,
[2760.84 --> 2761.80]  by the creation,
[2762.20 --> 2762.58]  preservation,
[2763.10 --> 2763.76]  and government
[2763.76 --> 2764.54]  of the universe,
[2765.08 --> 2766.14]  since the universe
[2766.14 --> 2767.56]  is before our eyes
[2767.56 --> 2768.96]  like a beautiful book
[2768.96 --> 2770.28]  in which all creatures,
[2770.42 --> 2771.16]  great and small,
[2771.72 --> 2772.72]  are as letters
[2772.72 --> 2774.64]  to make us ponder
[2774.64 --> 2776.16]  the invisible things
[2776.16 --> 2776.88]  of God,
[2777.56 --> 2778.98]  God's eternal power
[2778.98 --> 2780.28]  and divinity.
[2781.50 --> 2781.94]  Second,
[2782.10 --> 2782.86]  God makes himself
[2782.86 --> 2783.64]  known to us
[2783.64 --> 2784.20]  more fully
[2784.20 --> 2784.76]  and clearly
[2784.76 --> 2785.54]  by his holy
[2785.54 --> 2786.80]  and divine word
[2786.80 --> 2788.32]  as much as we need
[2788.32 --> 2789.16]  in this life
[2789.16 --> 2790.20]  for God's glory
[2790.20 --> 2793.04]  and for our salvation.
[2795.04 --> 2795.66]  Now,
[2795.72 --> 2796.42]  as a pastor,
[2796.86 --> 2797.88]  as a minister
[2797.88 --> 2798.66]  of the word,
[2799.32 --> 2800.60]  I spent my life
[2800.60 --> 2801.30]  on the second
[2801.30 --> 2802.40]  of those books,
[2802.64 --> 2803.54]  the book of scripture.
[2804.42 --> 2804.70]  You know,
[2804.74 --> 2806.36]  spent years studying it
[2806.36 --> 2807.90]  and years preaching
[2807.90 --> 2808.54]  out of it.
[2808.54 --> 2810.18]  But other people,
[2810.88 --> 2811.52]  astronomers,
[2812.28 --> 2813.02]  biologists,
[2813.46 --> 2814.04]  chemists,
[2814.54 --> 2815.20]  geologists,
[2815.40 --> 2815.96]  physicists,
[2816.44 --> 2817.20]  zoologists,
[2817.48 --> 2819.00]  they study that
[2819.00 --> 2820.32]  first book,
[2820.70 --> 2821.66]  the book of nature.
[2822.56 --> 2824.06]  They study the universe
[2824.06 --> 2826.50]  and the galaxies
[2826.50 --> 2828.18]  and our own galaxy,
[2828.32 --> 2829.16]  the Milky Way,
[2829.62 --> 2830.86]  with our sun
[2830.86 --> 2831.90]  and the earth
[2831.90 --> 2833.22]  orbiting the sun
[2833.22 --> 2834.70]  in the Goldilocks zone,
[2834.70 --> 2836.80]  that pale blue dot
[2836.80 --> 2837.68]  where everything
[2837.68 --> 2839.06]  is working just right.
[2840.14 --> 2841.20]  Scientists study
[2841.20 --> 2843.20]  how nature works
[2843.20 --> 2845.04]  together to support life.
[2845.30 --> 2845.46]  You know,
[2845.52 --> 2846.96]  how water gets taken
[2846.96 --> 2848.18]  up into the ocean
[2848.18 --> 2850.24]  and into the atmosphere
[2850.24 --> 2852.26]  and showers the earth,
[2852.52 --> 2853.74]  refreshing the ground
[2853.74 --> 2854.76]  and then returning
[2854.76 --> 2856.44]  to streams and rivers
[2856.44 --> 2857.90]  and back out to the sea.
[2858.52 --> 2860.02]  They study how life
[2860.02 --> 2861.36]  sustains itself
[2861.36 --> 2862.98]  and reproduces
[2862.98 --> 2864.30]  and develops
[2864.30 --> 2865.44]  in all its variety.
[2865.86 --> 2867.42]  They study human life,
[2867.52 --> 2868.04]  the workings
[2868.04 --> 2869.44]  of the human body
[2869.44 --> 2872.84]  and the deep mysteries
[2872.84 --> 2875.00]  of human consciousness.
[2876.04 --> 2877.74]  There are so many things
[2877.74 --> 2878.92]  we can discover.
[2880.60 --> 2881.26]  You don't have to be
[2881.26 --> 2883.08]  a professional scientist
[2883.08 --> 2884.80]  to be in awe
[2884.80 --> 2885.86]  at all of this.
[2886.80 --> 2888.84]  You just need to
[2888.84 --> 2891.36]  be open to the wonder
[2891.36 --> 2894.88]  of what we live in,
[2894.96 --> 2896.08]  where we live
[2896.08 --> 2897.56]  and what lives here.
[2898.04 --> 2899.76]  You just need to be curious,
[2900.20 --> 2901.56]  curious about the world
[2901.56 --> 2902.54]  and its beauty.
[2903.20 --> 2904.20]  And if you look
[2904.20 --> 2906.06]  with the eyes of faith
[2906.06 --> 2906.94]  and listen
[2906.94 --> 2908.62]  with the ears of faith,
[2908.84 --> 2909.58]  you will see
[2909.58 --> 2911.14]  the fingerprints of God
[2911.14 --> 2911.72]  everywhere
[2911.72 --> 2913.88]  and you will hear
[2913.88 --> 2915.40]  the song of creation
[2915.40 --> 2917.40]  in all places.
[2918.84 --> 2923.02]  One of my favorite
[2923.02 --> 2924.24]  writers ever
[2924.24 --> 2925.86]  is a man named
[2925.86 --> 2927.00]  Wendell Berry.
[2927.16 --> 2927.36]  I don't know
[2927.36 --> 2928.06]  if you know the name.
[2928.62 --> 2929.72]  He has been writing
[2929.72 --> 2930.42]  novels
[2930.42 --> 2932.78]  and poems
[2932.78 --> 2934.38]  and essays
[2934.38 --> 2935.68]  for over 50 years.
[2935.78 --> 2936.32]  I think he's in
[2936.32 --> 2937.82]  his late 80s now.
[2939.84 --> 2941.32]  And for 30,
[2941.66 --> 2941.92]  well,
[2942.04 --> 2942.96]  from early in life
[2942.96 --> 2944.10]  he was not only
[2944.10 --> 2945.56]  an essayist
[2945.56 --> 2946.16]  and a poet
[2946.16 --> 2947.08]  and a novelist,
[2947.16 --> 2947.86]  he was also
[2947.86 --> 2948.46]  a farmer.
[2949.52 --> 2950.34]  In 1965,
[2950.84 --> 2951.70]  he bought a
[2951.70 --> 2953.24]  sort of worn-down
[2953.24 --> 2954.54]  old tobacco farm
[2954.54 --> 2956.66]  and restored the soil
[2956.66 --> 2957.68]  and made it productive
[2957.68 --> 2958.56]  for corn
[2958.56 --> 2960.08]  and small grains.
[2962.10 --> 2962.52]  Wendell Berry
[2962.52 --> 2963.64]  is also a Christian.
[2964.62 --> 2965.38]  He calls himself
[2965.38 --> 2966.08]  a man who takes
[2966.08 --> 2967.40]  the gospel seriously.
[2968.40 --> 2969.48]  And that means,
[2969.82 --> 2970.38]  you know,
[2970.48 --> 2971.80]  respect for the earth
[2971.80 --> 2974.12]  and also a sense
[2974.12 --> 2974.78]  of wonder.
[2975.86 --> 2976.92]  And that comes out
[2976.92 --> 2977.68]  in a wonderful
[2977.68 --> 2978.38]  little poem
[2978.38 --> 2979.24]  he once wrote
[2979.24 --> 2980.24]  called
[2980.24 --> 2981.08]  The Peace,
[2981.82 --> 2983.86]  The Peace of Wild Things.
[2985.14 --> 2985.82]  He said,
[2985.82 --> 2988.38]  when despair grows in me
[2988.38 --> 2990.36]  and I wake in the night
[2990.36 --> 2991.74]  at the least sound
[2991.74 --> 2993.66]  in fear of what my life
[2993.66 --> 2994.78]  and my children's life
[2994.78 --> 2995.40]  may be,
[2996.52 --> 2997.44]  then I go down
[2997.44 --> 2998.76]  and lie in the wood
[2998.76 --> 3000.96]  where the wood drake,
[3001.06 --> 3001.68]  the wood duck,
[3001.80 --> 3002.34]  rests
[3002.34 --> 3004.24]  in his beauty
[3004.24 --> 3005.18]  on the water
[3005.18 --> 3006.54]  and the great
[3006.54 --> 3007.74]  heron feeds.
[3007.74 --> 3009.14]  I come
[3009.14 --> 3010.78]  into the peace
[3010.78 --> 3012.00]  of wild things
[3012.00 --> 3013.06]  who do not
[3013.06 --> 3014.38]  tax their lives
[3014.38 --> 3015.22]  with forethought
[3015.22 --> 3015.78]  of grief.
[3016.58 --> 3017.40]  I come
[3017.40 --> 3019.16]  into the presence
[3019.16 --> 3020.52]  of still water
[3020.52 --> 3022.24]  and I feel
[3022.24 --> 3022.82]  above me
[3022.82 --> 3024.10]  the day-blind
[3024.10 --> 3025.14]  stars
[3025.14 --> 3026.00]  waiting
[3026.00 --> 3027.36]  for their light.
[3028.58 --> 3029.60]  For a time
[3029.60 --> 3030.56]  I rest
[3030.56 --> 3032.14]  in the grace
[3032.14 --> 3032.96]  of the world
[3032.96 --> 3034.86]  and I am free.
[3037.74 --> 3038.88]  Have you got eyes
[3038.88 --> 3039.54]  that can see
[3039.54 --> 3040.16]  the fingerprints
[3040.16 --> 3041.00]  of God
[3041.00 --> 3042.14]  and ears
[3042.14 --> 3043.66]  that can hear
[3043.66 --> 3044.16]  the song
[3044.16 --> 3044.84]  of creation?
[3047.44 --> 3048.10]  You know,
[3048.16 --> 3048.68]  while we're here
[3048.68 --> 3049.12]  at worship
[3049.12 --> 3050.60]  and while you enjoy
[3050.60 --> 3052.02]  your Sunday dinner
[3052.02 --> 3054.76]  and while you sleep
[3054.76 --> 3055.88]  tonight,
[3056.16 --> 3056.88]  our part,
[3057.02 --> 3057.86]  the northern part
[3057.86 --> 3058.42]  of the earth
[3058.42 --> 3060.00]  is pulling closer
[3060.00 --> 3060.98]  and closer
[3060.98 --> 3061.76]  to the sun
[3061.76 --> 3063.86]  and it's getting warmer.
[3065.48 --> 3066.38]  Deers will have
[3066.38 --> 3067.16]  their dappled fawns
[3067.74 --> 3069.44]  birds will bring
[3069.44 --> 3070.58]  food to their chicks
[3070.58 --> 3071.20]  in the nest
[3071.20 --> 3071.72]  and raise
[3071.72 --> 3072.88]  the next generation.
[3073.84 --> 3074.32]  The trees
[3074.32 --> 3075.46]  will leaf out fully
[3075.46 --> 3076.30]  and we'll enjoy
[3076.30 --> 3076.90]  the shade.
[3077.62 --> 3078.82]  Flowers will bloom
[3078.82 --> 3079.60]  and butterflies
[3079.60 --> 3080.86]  will take their nectar.
[3081.50 --> 3082.22]  Our land,
[3082.34 --> 3082.88]  the forest
[3082.88 --> 3083.44]  and meadows
[3083.44 --> 3084.22]  and streams
[3084.22 --> 3085.68]  will be full
[3085.68 --> 3086.28]  of life.
[3087.82 --> 3088.40]  Now that happened
[3088.40 --> 3089.04]  last year too,
[3089.10 --> 3089.42]  I know.
[3089.90 --> 3090.74]  Happens every year.
[3092.30 --> 3093.18]  But don't ever
[3093.18 --> 3093.94]  lose your sense
[3093.94 --> 3094.52]  of wonder.
[3094.52 --> 3096.42]  we live in
[3096.42 --> 3097.82]  an amazing place
[3097.82 --> 3100.50]  and never get tired
[3100.50 --> 3101.12]  of praising
[3101.12 --> 3103.06]  the one who created it.
[3104.90 --> 3105.94]  Let's pray together.
[3107.66 --> 3108.60]  Dear Lord,
[3108.68 --> 3111.62]  you have created us
[3111.62 --> 3112.72]  in your image
[3112.72 --> 3113.52]  and likeness
[3113.52 --> 3116.06]  and then placed us
[3116.06 --> 3117.80]  in this astounding world
[3117.80 --> 3119.20]  in the middle
[3119.20 --> 3120.16]  of endless,
[3120.56 --> 3121.72]  empty space.
[3121.72 --> 3123.40]  we marvel
[3123.40 --> 3124.68]  at what you have
[3124.68 --> 3125.34]  given us
[3125.34 --> 3127.98]  in that pale blue dot
[3127.98 --> 3130.08]  where life
[3130.08 --> 3130.64]  has been
[3130.64 --> 3131.44]  thriving
[3131.44 --> 3133.18]  for so very,
[3133.34 --> 3134.06]  very long.
[3134.74 --> 3135.52]  We praise you,
[3135.60 --> 3136.30]  our creator,
[3136.90 --> 3138.32]  and give you thanks
[3138.32 --> 3139.38]  for all good things.

[3271.70 --> 3272.70]  The night will be lost,

[3454.42 --> 3463.76]  Richie is in Children's Hospital and has undergone testing, scans, and biopsies on an abnormality found in his little body.
[3463.76 --> 3470.98]  Pray for Richie's health and a positive outcome of tests and medical care.
[3470.98 --> 3478.36]  And pray for the parents and grandparents who are burdened with concern for his health and welfare.
[3478.36 --> 3483.70]  So may I lead you in prayer?
[3483.70 --> 3500.64]  Father, thank you for this message that we have just heard and how we've been reminded, really given perspective on this, your world and your care of it and of us.
[3500.64 --> 3513.22]  Lord, we are awestruck with what we've heard just in terms of physical distances and how things work.
[3513.22 --> 3517.00]  All designed and upheld by you.
[3517.00 --> 3518.56]  And we're so thankful.
[3518.56 --> 3524.54]  How majestic and glorious and excellent is your name in all the earth.
[3524.54 --> 3532.92]  You have invited us here this morning to fellowship with you and with each other because you love and care for us.
[3533.58 --> 3541.02]  As creator and sustainer of all things, we are so thankful for this relationship we can have with you through Christ.
[3541.02 --> 3543.54]  We serve a risen Savior.
[3545.12 --> 3549.64]  We also come knowing that we have not served you as we ought to have this past week.
[3550.86 --> 3554.26]  Opportunities missed to tell others the wonderful news of the gospel.
[3555.12 --> 3559.38]  Words that we have uttered revealing a heart not completely devoted to you.
[3560.38 --> 3563.30]  Not loving our neighbor as ourselves as we know we should.
[3563.30 --> 3569.42]  And still, you continue to love us and call us to a life of obedience.
[3569.86 --> 3571.30]  Great is your faithfulness.
[3572.90 --> 3577.98]  We are so thankful to live in a country where we may worship freely.
[3578.94 --> 3581.48]  We are thankful for the employment opportunities.
[3582.02 --> 3584.40]  And most of us are blessed to have opportunities.
[3585.36 --> 3587.72]  We are thankful for good health for many.
[3588.34 --> 3592.60]  And also for health care that is accessible for those of us who need it.
[3593.30 --> 3597.14]  We thank you along with all those who celebrate birthdays this week.
[3597.80 --> 3603.12]  We ask that you bless Felicia and Joel in their upcoming marriage on May the 6th.
[3603.94 --> 3608.82]  We praise you for the birth of Avina to proud parents Vahid and Benaz.
[3609.64 --> 3614.94]  And we are thankful for the privilege of gathering again now that COVID restrictions have been lifted.
[3615.66 --> 3619.00]  We so missed this very important part of our community worship.
[3619.00 --> 3626.82]  And while the restrictions have been lifted, we know that in the background, the virus has not been defeated.
[3627.34 --> 3632.98]  So we continue to pray for an end to what appears to be a never-ending cycle.
[3633.86 --> 3641.60]  We pray for the frontline workers in health care as they provide the necessary care and instruction to help keep us safe.
[3641.60 --> 3645.34]  We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine.
[3646.50 --> 3653.62]  We pray for the diplomatic efforts going on behind the scenes as world leaders seek an end to this war.
[3654.30 --> 3657.16]  We pray for those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[3657.88 --> 3663.54]  And for all who have been displaced from their homes and livelihoods as a result of this conflict.
[3663.54 --> 3671.68]  We pray for Christians worldwide and especially for those who are being persecuted for their faith in you.
[3672.98 --> 3678.08]  We also pray for our country where freedoms too seem to be eroding.
[3679.44 --> 3689.18]  We pray for those institutions that are diligently guarding against this erosion and standing up for freedom of religion and education and so much more.
[3689.18 --> 3696.78]  And we pray for Pastor Jason as he joins the team as they tour Israel, Jordan, and Egypt.
[3697.74 --> 3704.60]  Keep him well and may he be energized and inspired by his time there with other members of the team.
[3705.66 --> 3710.56]  We pray for Pastor Nancy as she continues the work among her Chinese congregation.
[3711.48 --> 3716.02]  We thank you for her tireless efforts to evangelize here at home and even abroad.
[3716.02 --> 3720.40]  We pray for Hannah and her work in children and worship ministry.
[3721.18 --> 3725.50]  Bless her efforts in teaching these young minds and hearts about the love of Jesus.
[3727.36 --> 3731.68]  Lord, we also pray for Synod this year, meeting in June.
[3732.96 --> 3738.12]  We pray that this may be a matter of continuing prayer in our daily lives, in our homes,
[3738.48 --> 3744.68]  as they face significant issues to iron out and come to agreement on.
[3746.02 --> 3751.44]  We pray for the ongoing concerns in the lives of our members who are experiencing health issues.
[3752.04 --> 3762.90]  We pray for Janet, Pat, Joyce, Carl, Grace, Mark, Shirley, Diane, Jeanette, and John.
[3762.90 --> 3769.54]  We pray for those in long-term care, Henry, Ellie, Jerry, and Anne.
[3770.62 --> 3776.68]  We continue to pray for Jerry as well as Jean as they have both recently experienced the loss of their spouses.
[3778.92 --> 3782.22]  We pray for the offerings that were taken this morning for new ground,
[3782.22 --> 3787.98]  and we pray that the offerings will support the efforts to establish sustainable local ministries
[3787.98 --> 3791.26]  in areas where this may not have been possible previously.
[3792.68 --> 3800.36]  And last, Lord, we end with what we began on, and it's a prayer for eight-day-old Richie Michael Hendrickson.
[3801.72 --> 3807.08]  We pray that you will be with him as he undergoes all these tests,
[3807.08 --> 3809.70]  and we pray for positive outcomes.
[3810.88 --> 3815.36]  We hold the parents and the grandparents in our prayers, too.
[3816.04 --> 3818.38]  And all this we pray in the name of Jesus.
[3819.46 --> 3819.74]  Amen.
[3819.74 --> 3819.84]  Amen.
[3833.48 --> 3835.76]  Please stand to receive the blessing.
[3837.08 --> 3840.58]  Go now in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[3841.26 --> 3847.26]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all,
[3847.34 --> 3849.18]  and let God's people say, Amen.
[3849.18 --> 3849.38]  Amen.
[3849.38 --> 3849.46]  Amen.
[3867.08 --> 3867.68]  Amen.
