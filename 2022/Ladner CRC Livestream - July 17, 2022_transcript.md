[0.00 --> 3.40]  You
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 61.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 121.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 211.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 241.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 319.88]  Well, good morning.
[319.88 --> 320.88]  Good morning.
[320.88 --> 323.68]  And welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[323.68 --> 327.52]  And of course, a special welcome if you're visiting with us today.
[327.52 --> 331.24]  We pray that we can be a blessing to each other as we go through this service.
[331.24 --> 332.24]  My name is Jake.
[332.24 --> 335.52]  I'll be taking us through portions of the service today.
[335.52 --> 339.80]  But of course, we have our very own Pastor Jason who's going to lead us in communion and
[339.80 --> 342.02]  scripture and in our praise team.
[342.02 --> 343.76]  We love listening to them.
[343.76 --> 346.76]  A special guest, Roger Gross on piano.
[346.76 --> 348.28]  Always love listening to you play, brother.
[348.28 --> 350.64]  I'm glad you're here.
[350.64 --> 356.50]  I don't have any other announcements to make, but better yet, we have a video.
[356.50 --> 362.72]  And it's a video about the camp that Pastor Nancy and 20 volunteers put together a couple
[362.72 --> 365.72]  of weeks ago with the theme of Noah's Ark.
[365.72 --> 368.18]  It was called His Descendants.
[368.18 --> 370.06]  They had about 30 kids attending.
[370.06 --> 374.94]  And so we've got a little video to talk about that and see if you can fact check a few of
[374.94 --> 375.94]  what I just relayed.
[375.94 --> 376.94]  Let's enjoy.
[376.94 --> 377.94]  Great question.
[377.94 --> 378.94]  Yeah.
[378.94 --> 379.94]  I think it's almost.
[379.94 --> 380.94]  Okay.
[380.94 --> 381.94]  Let's make everything.
[381.94 --> 382.94]  That's right.
[382.94 --> 383.94]  Okay.
[383.94 --> 384.94]  Okay.
[384.94 --> 385.94]  Let's make everything.
[385.94 --> 386.94]  Okay.
[386.94 --> 387.94]  Let's make everything.
[387.94 --> 388.94]  Okay.
[388.94 --> 390.94]  I love you because I love you.
[390.94 --> 392.94]  I love you.
[392.94 --> 396.94]  I love you.
[396.94 --> 397.94]  Jesus, I love you.
[397.94 --> 398.94]  I love you.
[398.94 --> 399.94]  I love you.
[399.94 --> 403.94]  I love you.
[403.94 --> 421.94]  Jesus, I love you.
[421.94 --> 422.94]  I love you.
[422.94 --> 428.94]  I love you.
[428.94 --> 431.94]  Thank you, Lord.
[431.94 --> 434.94]  Thank you, Lord.
[434.94 --> 439.94]  God
[464.94 --> 472.78]  Thank you Lord, that all that God may say, thank you Lord.
[489.00 --> 494.36]  Bring it home, bring it home, tell us all your promises.
[494.94 --> 499.98]  I'm a father, you are a love, and you're sliding over me.
[500.32 --> 504.46]  Bring it home, bring it home, tell us how I am.
[504.46 --> 506.84]  Let's bow our hands to pray.
[509.90 --> 522.62]  Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the food, for the beautiful weather, for the beautiful boys and girls you granted us.
[522.62 --> 527.16]  For the beautiful days we spend together.
[528.00 --> 536.24]  We just pray that your truth will be rooted in their mess, in our mess.
[536.24 --> 541.12]  Thank you.
[541.12 --> 542.12]  Thank you.
[542.12 --> 544.98]  Thank you.
[544.98 --> 574.96]  Thank you.
[574.98 --> 579.32]  Looks like a wonderful time was had by all and that food looked absolutely delicious.
[582.38 --> 587.46]  Our greeting and call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 27 and John 4.
[588.58 --> 592.16]  Let us worship God, our light and our salvation.
[593.20 --> 595.74]  The Lord is the stronghold of our lives.
[596.40 --> 601.04]  We desire to live in God's house and to seek God in his holy temple.
[601.04 --> 606.56]  We have come with shouts of joy to sing and to make music to the Lord.
[607.20 --> 610.60]  Let us worship God in spirit and in truth.
[611.58 --> 617.04]  Teach us your ways and make straight our paths in this hour of worship and always.
[617.86 --> 618.12]  Amen.
[618.12 --> 623.74]  And now is a good time to stand, if you can, and take a moment to greet those around you.
[623.86 --> 624.70]  Welcome to their service.
[625.26 --> 627.46]  And then our praise team is going to lead us in three songs.
[627.46 --> 628.16]  Thank you.
[628.16 --> 635.06]  Thank you.
[635.06 --> 642.88]  Thank you.
[642.88 --> 672.86]  Thank you.
[672.88 --> 694.80]  Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes, let me see. Beauty that made this heart adore you. Oh, power my life spent with you.
[694.80 --> 708.30]  Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God.
[708.30 --> 719.30]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[719.30 --> 734.30]  King of all days, oh, so highly exalted. Glorious in heaven above.
[734.30 --> 745.44]  Humbly you came to the earth, you created. All form of sake we gain hope.
[745.44 --> 758.68]  Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God.
[758.68 --> 769.68]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[769.68 --> 780.84]  Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God.
[780.84 --> 791.68]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[791.68 --> 812.32]  He is exalted. The King is exalted on high. I will praise Him.
[812.32 --> 831.48]  He is exalted forever. I will praise Him. He is the Lord forever. His children shall be.
[831.48 --> 839.26]  Heaven and earth rejoice in His holy name.
[839.26 --> 852.52]  He is exalted. He is exalted. The King is exalted on high. He is exalted. The King is exalted on high.
[852.52 --> 865.94]  I will praise Him. He is exalted forever. Exalted in high. I will praise His name.
[865.94 --> 881.38]  He is the Lord forever. His children shall be. Heaven and earth rejoice in His holy name.
[881.38 --> 895.92]  He is exalted. The King is exalted on high. He is exalted. The King is exalted on high.
[895.92 --> 899.36]  His child shall be. Amen and episodes.
[899.36 --> 901.18]  The King will receive the Lord forever in His holy name.
[901.18 --> 908.22]  Christ the King is the Lord forever in His holy name.
[912.22 --> 919.14]  Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful.
[919.14 --> 923.70]  Where your streams of abundance flow
[923.70 --> 927.38]  Blessed be your name
[927.38 --> 931.98]  Blessed be your name
[931.98 --> 936.10]  When I'm found in the desert place
[936.10 --> 939.58]  Though I walk through the wilderness
[939.58 --> 943.70]  Blessed be your name
[943.70 --> 948.96]  Every blessing you pour out of
[948.96 --> 952.80]  Turn back to praise
[952.80 --> 956.78]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[956.78 --> 959.36]  Still I will say
[959.36 --> 963.52]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[963.52 --> 967.36]  Blessed be your name
[967.36 --> 971.52]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[971.52 --> 975.76]  Blessed be your glorious name
[978.96 --> 982.80]  Blessed be your name
[982.80 --> 986.78]  When the sun's shining down on me
[986.78 --> 991.06]  When the world's all as it should be
[991.06 --> 993.70]  Blessed be your name
[993.70 --> 998.98]  Blessed be your name
[998.98 --> 999.08]  Blessed be your name
[999.08 --> 1002.52]  On the road marked with suffering
[1002.52 --> 1006.52]  While there's pain in the offering
[1006.52 --> 1009.98]  Blessed be your name
[1009.98 --> 1019.52]  I'll be blessing you for all I'll turn back to praise
[1019.52 --> 1023.50]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[1023.50 --> 1026.16]  Still I will say
[1026.16 --> 1030.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1030.12 --> 1032.86]  Blessed be your name
[1032.86 --> 1035.10]  Blessed be your name
[1035.10 --> 1035.70]  Blessed be your name
[1035.76 --> 1035.84]  Blessed be your name
[1035.84 --> 1036.44]  Blessed be the name
[1036.44 --> 1037.00]  Blessed be your name
[1037.68 --> 1040.26]  Blessed be your name
[1040.26 --> 1042.30]  Blessed be your name
[1042.30 --> 1042.68]  Blessed be your earth
[1042.68 --> 1054.86]  You may be seated.
[1066.00 --> 1068.90]  Our call to confession this morning comes from Isaiah 30.
[1068.90 --> 1073.18]  In repentance and rest is your salvation.
[1073.82 --> 1076.54]  In quietness and trust is your strength.
[1077.12 --> 1078.30]  But you would have none of it.
[1079.38 --> 1081.78]  Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you.
[1082.42 --> 1084.32]  He rises to show you compassion.
[1085.00 --> 1086.66]  For the Lord is God of justice.
[1087.40 --> 1088.90]  Blessed are all who wait for him.
[1089.68 --> 1091.28]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1095.72 --> 1097.18]  Holy and merciful God,
[1097.18 --> 1100.08]  in your presence we confess our sinfulness,
[1100.78 --> 1101.70]  our shortcomings,
[1102.20 --> 1103.76]  and our offenses against you.
[1104.68 --> 1107.32]  You alone know how often we have sinned
[1107.32 --> 1108.78]  in wandering from your ways,
[1109.34 --> 1110.42]  in wasting your gifts,
[1111.06 --> 1112.24]  in forgetting your love.
[1113.08 --> 1114.58]  Have mercy on us, O Lord,
[1115.02 --> 1116.66]  for we are ashamed and sorry
[1116.66 --> 1119.18]  for all we have done to displease you.
[1120.62 --> 1123.30]  Forgive our sins and help us to live in your light
[1123.30 --> 1125.18]  and walk in your ways
[1125.18 --> 1126.90]  for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[1126.90 --> 1127.56]  our Savior.
[1128.08 --> 1128.40]  Amen.
[1131.22 --> 1133.52]  And our confidence as Christians
[1133.52 --> 1136.92]  is that in Christ we do have forgiveness of sins.
[1137.28 --> 1138.64]  We're reminded of that this morning
[1138.64 --> 1141.56]  with these words from Romans 8 and Corinthians 5.
[1141.56 --> 1143.40]  Hear the good news.
[1144.20 --> 1146.06]  Who is in a position to condemn?
[1146.76 --> 1147.74]  Only Christ.
[1148.36 --> 1149.94]  And Christ died for us.
[1150.88 --> 1152.26]  Christ rose for us.
[1153.02 --> 1155.30]  Christ reigns in power for us.
[1156.12 --> 1157.48]  Christ prays for us.
[1158.52 --> 1161.96]  Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.
[1162.76 --> 1163.94]  The old life has gone.
[1164.58 --> 1165.88]  A new life has begun.
[1166.74 --> 1168.34]  Know that you are forgiven
[1168.34 --> 1169.68]  and be at peace.
[1171.06 --> 1173.04]  Let's praise that with another song
[1173.04 --> 1173.62]  from our praise team.
[1195.88 --> 1210.88]  Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me,
[1210.88 --> 1223.56]  and that thou bidst me come to thee, O Lamb of God I call.
[1223.56 --> 1228.16]  I come.
[1231.60 --> 1246.56]  Just as I am and waiting not to raise my soul upon dark heart,
[1246.56 --> 1259.56]  to thee whose blood and dwelled each part, O Lamb of God I call.
[1259.56 --> 1264.56]  I come.
[1264.56 --> 1283.16]  Just as I am, thou wilt receive, wilt welcome, power and hands relieve,
[1283.16 --> 1296.16]  because thy promise that I believe, O Lamb of God I call.
[1296.16 --> 1303.16]  I come.
[1303.16 --> 1319.16]  Just as I am, thou tors about, with many a calm, with many a doubt,
[1319.16 --> 1333.16]  fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God I call.
[1333.16 --> 1340.16]  I come.
[1340.16 --> 1364.16]  I can live by two angels and hosts it.
[1364.16 --> 1370.18]  Before we come to this table, we proclaim our faith together.
[1370.18 --> 1374.22]  So let us recite the Apostles' Creed together.
[1374.96 --> 1375.70]  We'll have it here.
[1376.70 --> 1383.00]  I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[1383.86 --> 1388.78]  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[1388.78 --> 1394.58]  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1395.48 --> 1402.16]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1402.86 --> 1404.36]  He descended to hell.
[1405.42 --> 1408.82]  The third day, he rose again from the dead.
[1409.48 --> 1415.40]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[1415.40 --> 1421.18]  From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1422.38 --> 1427.16]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,
[1427.88 --> 1431.96]  the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[1432.74 --> 1437.06]  the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1437.86 --> 1438.32]  Amen.
[1438.32 --> 1446.76]  One thing about this table is that at this table, we see the Lord's work in time.
[1448.04 --> 1454.08]  The prophets and the apostles foretold the salvation that God would bring to his people.
[1455.12 --> 1457.30]  And then Jesus came and he fulfilled it.
[1457.46 --> 1458.46]  He died on the cross.
[1458.56 --> 1462.42]  He rose again, accomplishing salvation for us.
[1462.42 --> 1464.72]  And now the church keeps it.
[1465.36 --> 1468.94]  And we do this until he returns.
[1470.12 --> 1475.12]  But here also we see what is most important, what our greatest treasure is.
[1475.60 --> 1478.60]  Because Christ himself is our life.
[1479.58 --> 1484.80]  And it is at this table that we actually participate in that.
[1485.30 --> 1488.98]  Where we eat and drink of his body and blood.
[1490.48 --> 1492.22]  Participating in his grace.
[1493.18 --> 1495.44]  So friends, if this is not your faith,
[1495.96 --> 1498.96]  if you have not been baptized into the body of Christ, the church,
[1499.22 --> 1501.70]  then this communion is not yet for you.
[1502.06 --> 1503.58]  But we are very glad you are here.
[1504.50 --> 1509.50]  And it is my prayer that rather than taking the cup and bread that's passed,
[1509.60 --> 1511.76]  that you would instead take Jesus Christ.
[1512.22 --> 1514.92]  And that you would receive him as your greatest treasure.
[1514.92 --> 1519.62]  So the words of institution of the Lord's Supper.
[1519.62 --> 1521.64]  Remember, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1522.16 --> 1525.36]  On the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1526.16 --> 1528.98]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1529.06 --> 1530.68]  This is my body, which is for you.
[1531.44 --> 1533.62]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1533.62 --> 1538.04]  There's the Chinese.
[1539.16 --> 1539.72]  Next.
[1539.72 --> 1543.58]  In the same way, after supper, he took the cup saying,
[1544.06 --> 1546.50]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1547.30 --> 1550.36]  As often as you do this, whenever you drink it,
[1550.72 --> 1552.80]  do this in remembrance of me.
[1552.80 --> 1557.04]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1557.10 --> 1560.84]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1561.80 --> 1563.24]  So brothers and sisters,
[1564.46 --> 1569.60]  lift up your hearts.
[1570.80 --> 1575.00]  We are his people.
[1578.16 --> 1580.66]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1581.46 --> 1582.56]  Christ has died.
[1583.16 --> 1584.14]  Christ is risen.
[1584.76 --> 1586.20]  Christ will come again.
[1586.74 --> 1589.34]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1589.78 --> 1590.08]  Hallelujah.
[1591.72 --> 1593.70]  Friends, these are the gifts of God for you,
[1593.78 --> 1594.86]  the people of God.
[1595.42 --> 1598.62]  Feed on Christ in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving.
[1599.38 --> 1602.74]  And drink remembering that Christ's blood was shed for you.
[1604.02 --> 1606.80]  Invite our elders and deacons to come forward
[1606.80 --> 1608.54]  and help me serve the elements.
[1608.54 --> 1612.72]  And as you do so, this is a time,
[1613.04 --> 1614.40]  as you wait for the elements to come,
[1614.48 --> 1615.42]  that you can meditate,
[1615.70 --> 1617.18]  you can pray to the Lord,
[1617.54 --> 1620.28]  and we will also, I believe, sing together.
[1620.28 --> 1621.34]  So we pray.
[1621.34 --> 1633.84]  This is the other love you so much.
[1633.84 --> 1636.22]  Let's hear this.
[1636.22 --> 1638.32]  So we pray.
[1638.32 --> 1663.24]  I hear the Savior say,
[1663.24 --> 1667.68]  Thy strength indeed is all.
[1667.68 --> 1672.16]  Child of weakness, watch and pray.
[1672.64 --> 1677.44]  Find in me thine all in all.
[1678.22 --> 1686.04]  Jesus being it all, all to Him I owe.
[1687.56 --> 1691.48]  Sin had left a crimson stain,
[1691.48 --> 1696.04]  He washed it white as snow.
[1697.68 --> 1703.56]  For now indeed I find,
[1704.04 --> 1708.08]  Thy power that alone,
[1708.64 --> 1712.90]  Can change the leper's voice,
[1713.42 --> 1717.68]  Can melt the heart of stone.
[1717.68 --> 1727.44]  Jesus being it all, all to Him I owe.

[1967.80 --> 1969.80]  Jesus paid Him all, all to Him I owe.
[1969.80 --> 1973.80]  Sin that left the crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

[2068.14 --> 2075.68]  And for the church that you have now called to yourself that celebrates this meal until you come again.
[2076.48 --> 2081.80]  Lord, we thank you that we could commune with you, that we could dwell with you by your spirit.
[2081.80 --> 2092.30]  And Lord, would you empower us with a faith that comes from you and that we need, that we might closely walk after you.
[2092.76 --> 2094.54]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2094.92 --> 2095.52]  Please be seated.
[2104.80 --> 2110.20]  Okay, so I think there are at least a couple of kids and I'd love to share a Bible verse with you.
[2110.20 --> 2111.30]  Would you come up and join me?
[2111.30 --> 2129.96]  Come on, have a seat.
[2129.96 --> 2134.96]  All right.
[2138.96 --> 2140.40]  All right, yeah, come over here.
[2144.40 --> 2146.78]  All right.
[2146.78 --> 2147.96]  Have a seat.
[2148.06 --> 2148.28]  Hello.
[2149.80 --> 2150.20]  Okay.
[2150.80 --> 2153.18]  So I have a Bible verse I wanted to share with you today.
[2153.78 --> 2154.06]  Okay.
[2155.10 --> 2156.14]  Here's what it says.
[2156.14 --> 2158.38]  Jesus said this.
[2158.38 --> 2159.34]  Jesus said,
[2159.94 --> 2165.58]  Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[2166.42 --> 2173.12]  Take my yoke upon you and learn from you in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[2173.20 --> 2175.92]  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[2176.74 --> 2179.40]  You know, so Jesus tells us to come to him.
[2179.50 --> 2180.02]  Do you know that?
[2180.84 --> 2181.58]  Even kids.
[2182.30 --> 2183.28]  Jesus says, come to me.
[2183.34 --> 2184.34]  We can go to Jesus.
[2184.34 --> 2185.28]  Stop it.
[2185.28 --> 2186.36]  It's okay.
[2188.16 --> 2190.02]  Jesus says something special.
[2190.50 --> 2193.06]  Jesus says, a yoke is easy.
[2193.26 --> 2194.42]  Who knows what a yoke is?
[2195.82 --> 2196.54]  You know?
[2197.26 --> 2197.78]  Wow.
[2198.38 --> 2198.52]  Hi.
[2199.94 --> 2205.82]  A yoke is a big piece of wood that would go on top of an animal, like an ox, a big, strong ox,
[2205.98 --> 2209.28]  and it would be used to pull very heavy loads.
[2210.08 --> 2211.60]  So what do you think about a yoke?
[2211.60 --> 2214.48]  Is it a weight or is it heavy?
[2216.24 --> 2216.88]  It's heavy.
[2216.96 --> 2218.02]  It's a big, heavy thing.
[2218.06 --> 2219.02]  So I have something very heavy.
[2219.62 --> 2220.30]  I have this.
[2221.06 --> 2221.44]  Is it any?
[2221.68 --> 2222.40]  Yeah, it is a weight.
[2222.48 --> 2224.26]  Would anybody like to try to pick it up?
[2224.76 --> 2224.96]  Yes?
[2225.04 --> 2225.20]  Okay.
[2225.26 --> 2225.62]  Here we go.
[2226.04 --> 2226.44]  Come over.
[2226.56 --> 2227.14]  You can try it.
[2227.14 --> 2232.62]  Good job.
[2232.70 --> 2233.14]  You're strong.
[2234.00 --> 2234.42]  All right.
[2234.52 --> 2235.94]  Does anybody else want to try to lift it?
[2236.40 --> 2237.20]  Can I lift that?
[2237.60 --> 2238.22]  Maybe not.
[2240.38 --> 2240.78]  Okay.
[2241.46 --> 2243.12]  I have something very light.
[2243.98 --> 2245.50]  If I don't fly through the roof.
[2245.70 --> 2249.38]  Yeah, it has a weight on it because it's so light that without this little clip on it,
[2249.40 --> 2251.70]  it would fly right up there and get tangled up in the fan.
[2252.44 --> 2253.66]  Does anybody want to try to lift this?
[2254.14 --> 2254.62]  Yes.
[2254.62 --> 2255.10]  Okay.
[2255.30 --> 2256.16]  Your turn.
[2257.06 --> 2257.90]  Is it heavy?
[2258.78 --> 2260.06]  No, it's not heavy at all.
[2262.00 --> 2263.40]  Yeah, that's very heavy.
[2263.54 --> 2263.68]  Okay.
[2266.08 --> 2266.52]  Yeah.
[2266.98 --> 2267.36]  There you go.
[2267.40 --> 2268.12]  You can try to hold that.
[2269.14 --> 2269.94]  There you go.
[2270.38 --> 2272.14]  So let me tell you what Jesus says.
[2272.30 --> 2279.92]  Jesus says all of the other world that we put on our shoulders is like this heavy weight.
[2279.98 --> 2280.80]  It's so heavy.
[2281.22 --> 2282.76]  It makes us feel so tired.
[2282.76 --> 2285.54]  Imagine carrying this around on your shoulder all the time.
[2286.20 --> 2286.46]  Right?
[2286.72 --> 2287.62]  It's so heavy.
[2288.12 --> 2291.68]  But Jesus said my is like a helium balloon.
[2292.46 --> 2293.52]  It's so light.
[2294.38 --> 2294.54]  Okay.
[2294.54 --> 2298.80]  And so why do we even have this yoke on us that Jesus gives us?
[2299.80 --> 2301.84]  Jesus says you take my yoke and his.
[2304.04 --> 2306.36]  And what it means is that we are submitted to him.
[2306.82 --> 2309.06]  It's a symbol that we obey him.
[2309.12 --> 2309.76]  We trust him.
[2309.76 --> 2310.46]  And we look to him.
[2311.32 --> 2312.88]  But he says my yoke is light.
[2313.00 --> 2313.90]  So it's not even heavy.
[2313.98 --> 2315.20]  It's not a burden for us at all.
[2315.38 --> 2317.42]  And Jesus helps us to follow him.
[2317.92 --> 2318.10]  Okay.
[2318.16 --> 2319.00]  So can you remember that?
[2319.58 --> 2321.74]  Jesus' yoke is a helium balloon.
[2322.24 --> 2322.48]  Okay.
[2322.66 --> 2322.96]  It's very.
[2323.84 --> 2324.24]  Okay.
[2324.68 --> 2325.16]  All right.
[2325.66 --> 2326.74]  Let me pray for us.
[2327.70 --> 2331.06]  Jesus, I pray that you would help us to carry your yoke.
[2331.76 --> 2333.86]  And Lord, we thank you that it is so light.
[2334.80 --> 2336.26]  And that you help us carry it.
[2336.48 --> 2337.56]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2337.56 --> 2337.94]  Amen.
[2338.48 --> 2338.74]  All right.
[2338.88 --> 2339.56]  In your hands.
[2340.74 --> 2341.14]  Okay.
[2341.66 --> 2341.94]  All right.
[2342.42 --> 2342.96]  Go ahead.
[2343.04 --> 2343.70]  Back to your seats.
[2343.70 --> 2344.34]  All right.
[2345.24 --> 2346.06]  All right.
[2346.06 --> 2357.78]  All right.
[2376.06 --> 2383.66]  So, the children who are grades three to age three to grade one, you may go to a Sunday
[2383.66 --> 2384.66]  school class.
[2384.66 --> 2389.14]  And for our Chinese brothers and sisters, you will have a sermon in the fireside room.
[2389.14 --> 2394.14]  So thank you for joining us.
[2394.14 --> 2421.00]  Okay, let's pray together.
[2421.00 --> 2426.10]  Dear God and our Father, we give thanks for your word.
[2426.10 --> 2431.66]  And as we enter into a study of it, we give thanks for the Holy Spirit who inspired it
[2431.66 --> 2436.74]  and for the Holy Spirit who indwells us so that he who lives within us is able to recognize
[2436.74 --> 2441.86]  his own writing and is able to bless us through it.
[2441.86 --> 2446.02]  So Father, I thank you for each soul who is here this morning.
[2446.02 --> 2451.12]  Father, you know the mind and the makeup of each person in this room.
[2451.12 --> 2456.88]  And it's my prayer that each one of us would be moved by your spirit to embrace Jesus Christ
[2456.88 --> 2460.60]  today through the preaching of his word.
[2460.60 --> 2462.12]  We ask in Christ's name.
[2462.12 --> 2463.12]  Amen.
[2463.12 --> 2464.12]  Amen.
[2464.12 --> 2465.12]  Amen.
[2465.12 --> 2469.58]  So we are in a sermon series this summer in the letter of Ephesians.
[2469.58 --> 2471.92]  And we're calling this series Life Together.
[2471.92 --> 2476.16]  Because here's a question.
[2476.16 --> 2481.22]  If we were to ask this question, what are God's purposes in the world?
[2481.22 --> 2485.62]  All right, what's God up to in the world?
[2485.62 --> 2489.56]  The answer is God is up to the church.
[2490.52 --> 2492.54]  Okay, he is building his church.
[2492.66 --> 2493.68]  That's what God is up to.
[2494.16 --> 2496.52]  And that's what the book of Ephesians is all about.
[2497.68 --> 2502.44]  So with that being said, I want to invite you, invite us to look at this text together.
[2503.48 --> 2506.64]  And as we read it, I want you to know that it's talking about you.
[2507.90 --> 2512.22]  It's talking about who we are as the people of God.
[2512.22 --> 2515.34]  So let's turn our attention to God's word.
[2515.52 --> 2516.54]  I will read it for us.
[2516.82 --> 2521.40]  So we are in Ephesians chapter 2, verses 11 through 18.
[2523.74 --> 2531.38]  Therefore, remember that formerly, you who are Gentiles by birth and called uncircumcised
[2531.38 --> 2537.52]  by those who call themselves the circumcision, which is done in the body by human hands,
[2537.52 --> 2545.40]  remember that at that time, you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel
[2545.40 --> 2551.24]  and foreigners to the covenants of the promise without hope and without God in the world.
[2551.86 --> 2557.78]  But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[2557.78 --> 2565.64]  For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier,
[2566.20 --> 2572.16]  the dividing wall of hostility, by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations.
[2572.96 --> 2581.88]  His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace.
[2581.88 --> 2589.74]  And in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
[2590.42 --> 2595.28]  He came and preached peace to you who are far away and peace to those who are near.
[2595.64 --> 2601.06]  For through him we both have access to the Father by one spirit.
[2603.12 --> 2604.48]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2605.34 --> 2606.36]  Thanks be to God.
[2606.36 --> 2613.22]  The message today and the text today is all about walls being broken down.
[2613.36 --> 2617.78]  So that those who cannot have a relationship prior to that can.
[2619.88 --> 2627.16]  So as I've mentioned before and as many of you know, in July I had the opportunity to travel to Egypt, Jordan, and Israel
[2627.16 --> 2629.76]  with a group of other CRC pastors.
[2630.22 --> 2633.12]  So Todd Statham, who preached for us last week, was also on that trip.
[2633.12 --> 2638.60]  And one of the things that really struck me about our time in the city of Jerusalem
[2638.60 --> 2642.00]  is that there are all sorts of people living there.
[2642.12 --> 2645.00]  There are Jews, there are Muslims, there are Christians.
[2645.46 --> 2649.64]  All living together, but all living separate.
[2650.82 --> 2656.92]  And not only are there spiritual walls, but there are also even sometimes physical walls.
[2657.74 --> 2659.36]  So I want to show you this first photo.
[2659.36 --> 2664.14]  And I want you to think back with me in time to ancient Jerusalem.
[2665.20 --> 2671.50]  This is a model of the city during the second temple period that we saw in the Israel Museum.
[2672.72 --> 2675.92]  And in Jerusalem there is what's called the Temple Mount.
[2676.82 --> 2679.86]  And Solomon, the son of David, built the temple there.
[2679.86 --> 2685.58]  But after the destruction of Solomon's temple by the Babylonians in 587 BC,
[2686.94 --> 2692.90]  Nehemiah and Ezra, when they were sent back to the city from their captivity in Babylon,
[2693.50 --> 2694.60]  they rebuilt the temple.
[2695.26 --> 2700.24]  But it was nothing like the remodeling that King Herod did in his day.
[2700.68 --> 2703.18]  And that's the model of, that's the picture of that.
[2704.48 --> 2708.62]  And King Herod was known as Herod the Great.
[2708.62 --> 2710.94]  And he was called Great.
[2711.42 --> 2712.52]  Why was he called Great?
[2712.60 --> 2713.54]  He was actually a scoundrel.
[2713.94 --> 2719.20]  But he was called Great because of the massive building projects that he did.
[2719.62 --> 2725.30]  And one of these massive building projects was the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.
[2726.64 --> 2728.54]  Herod's temple was huge.
[2728.98 --> 2730.34]  It was ornate.
[2730.46 --> 2731.50]  It was covered in gold.
[2731.76 --> 2733.36]  It was absolutely beautiful.
[2733.36 --> 2737.50]  And there's this really funny place in the Gospel of Mark, I think chapter 13,
[2737.70 --> 2740.14]  where the disciples are with Jesus and they say,
[2740.42 --> 2742.54]  Jesus, look at these massive stones.
[2742.72 --> 2744.36]  Look at this amazing thing.
[2744.40 --> 2746.52]  Because it was so awe-inspiring.
[2747.22 --> 2747.62]  The temple.
[2748.98 --> 2753.16]  And Herod built these walls all around the Temple Mount.
[2753.92 --> 2755.68]  And then he filled it in.
[2755.68 --> 2760.60]  And created this huge rectangular structure for the temple.
[2760.78 --> 2762.52]  And then all of these other buildings.
[2762.60 --> 2766.00]  You can imagine 2,000 years ago, this was a huge construction project.
[2767.30 --> 2772.84]  And there were a series of walls that surrounded the temple that formed the inner court.
[2772.92 --> 2775.26]  So you see the temple, the Holy of Holies, a tall thing.
[2775.50 --> 2777.72]  Then there's the wall around that.
[2777.80 --> 2778.76]  That's the inner court.
[2778.76 --> 2782.28]  And only Jews were allowed in that area.
[2782.96 --> 2786.08]  And then you had the rest of that area, which is the Gentile court.
[2786.94 --> 2790.92]  And you can see kind of very lightly a very low wall that kind of goes around.
[2791.74 --> 2796.66]  And on that wall, there would be signs posted, inscriptions that basically said,
[2796.94 --> 2798.18]  trespassers will be killed.
[2799.28 --> 2804.20]  And they were aimed at the Gentiles if they ever dared to ascend those steps
[2804.20 --> 2806.16]  and walk into the Jewish court.
[2806.16 --> 2812.08]  And so this wall, that little low wall, but really the wall surrounding the whole inner court,
[2812.64 --> 2819.56]  it was a wall of exclusion and hostility between Jews and every other nation who wasn't a Jew.
[2821.00 --> 2823.44]  Now let's zoom forward to the present day.
[2824.46 --> 2825.60]  I want to show you another photo.
[2828.68 --> 2831.00]  So here's another photo we took on the trip.
[2831.20 --> 2834.68]  And the wall right there is called the Western Wall.
[2834.68 --> 2840.14]  And one of the great conundrums of history is that the Dome of the Rock,
[2840.26 --> 2847.46]  which is that blue mosaic mosque, that's a Muslim mosque with a gold dome there,
[2848.24 --> 2853.98]  it now sits right on top of the very foundation where the temple was built.
[2853.98 --> 2862.74]  And religious Jews gather here because the Western Wall is the closest they can get to where the temple was,
[2863.06 --> 2865.20]  where they are permitted to pray.
[2866.88 --> 2873.94]  And so today the Western Wall very much represents a wall of exclusion and hostility between Jew and Gentile.
[2873.94 --> 2880.46]  And there's one more kind of wall that represents the present day conflict between Jew and Gentile
[2880.46 --> 2881.90]  that I want to share with you in the next photo.
[2882.56 --> 2886.26]  So today, when you go to the Holy Land,
[2886.74 --> 2889.50]  there are parts of it that are under Israeli jurisdiction
[2889.50 --> 2892.26]  and there are parts of it that are under Palestinian jurisdiction.
[2893.08 --> 2896.62]  And part of our trip included going to some places that were in Palestine.
[2896.62 --> 2900.96]  So here's a checkpoint that we had a cross through going into Bethlehem,
[2901.18 --> 2903.16]  which is under Palestinian jurisdiction.
[2904.36 --> 2907.54]  So we had a cross through this, there was a checkpoint, there were guards,
[2908.02 --> 2910.76]  and there's this big wall surrounding the territory.
[2912.18 --> 2915.20]  And then the next photo is this warning sign.
[2915.76 --> 2919.58]  So we got off the bus, with the bus park, the bus driver's not happy about this.
[2919.78 --> 2922.78]  The bus parks, we all get off, and our guide is like,
[2923.00 --> 2925.62]  we're not actually supposed to be here right now, so let's just be quick.
[2925.62 --> 2927.18]  And then you read this sign.
[2930.94 --> 2932.90]  Entrance for Israel's citizens is forbidden,
[2933.72 --> 2935.88]  dangerous to your life, and against the law.
[2937.56 --> 2939.98]  And so what we had God off to do, see that tree right there?
[2940.02 --> 2940.76]  It's a mustard tree.
[2941.96 --> 2943.30]  So we got off to see the tree.
[2943.40 --> 2945.02]  But it also makes a great picture of this sign.
[2945.54 --> 2950.02]  And this sign, I was just thinking, it says the exact same thing as the sign 2,000 years ago
[2950.02 --> 2954.06]  on the wall that separated the Gentile court and the Israel court.
[2955.62 --> 2956.66]  Entrance is forbidden.
[2957.24 --> 2960.18]  Enter upon, if you die, it's your fault, basically.
[2960.18 --> 2966.30]  Now the reason I'm showing you these photos and talking about these walls between Jews and Gentiles
[2966.30 --> 2971.66]  is that it's the same situation that Paul is addressing in the letter of Ephesians.
[2972.46 --> 2976.60]  You see, the apostle Paul is no stranger to this kind of struggle.
[2977.64 --> 2977.82]  Right?
[2977.82 --> 2982.54]  Remember, he is writing to Jews and Gentiles who have been separated from each other
[2982.54 --> 2986.94]  by centuries of mutual hatred and war and slavery.
[2988.18 --> 2990.88]  And yet, into the midst of this hostility,
[2991.66 --> 2995.04]  Paul tells them that something fundamentally has changed.
[2995.86 --> 2998.16]  The prince of peace has come.
[2999.22 --> 2999.48]  Right?
[2999.48 --> 3004.54]  In Jesus Christ, God has entered into this broken, hostile, and divided world.
[3005.04 --> 3008.18]  And through his life, death, and resurrection, he has made peace.
[3008.96 --> 3012.70]  And he is tearing down all the walls that divide us
[3012.70 --> 3017.14]  to create in himself this one new humanity called the church.
[3017.14 --> 3022.44]  So Paul is writing to this group of fledgling Christians in Ephesus
[3022.44 --> 3027.60]  in this church, just think about it, made up of Jew and Gentile.
[3028.42 --> 3031.20]  And he's saying that because Christ is our peace,
[3032.02 --> 3036.20]  we are to practice peace in our life together as the church.
[3037.48 --> 3040.20]  And he says that we do this in two ways in this passage.
[3040.32 --> 3041.80]  And I just want to look at these two ways.
[3042.48 --> 3043.46]  And the first is this.
[3043.46 --> 3047.02]  We're invited to remember the barriers of peace,
[3047.30 --> 3048.52]  or the barriers to peace.
[3049.90 --> 3053.06]  See, Paul begins in verse 11, inviting his readers
[3053.06 --> 3055.84]  to remember their deep divisions.
[3056.86 --> 3059.94]  And he begins, actually, by underscoring the problem.
[3061.04 --> 3064.20]  They'll remember, they're together in a room just like this,
[3064.32 --> 3065.84]  listening to someone read this letter.
[3066.14 --> 3067.48]  Jew and Gentile sing together.
[3068.88 --> 3071.98]  So keep that in mind when we read what he writes here.
[3071.98 --> 3074.08]  So this is what he writes in verse 11 and 12.
[3074.96 --> 3079.20]  Therefore, remember that formally, you who are Gentiles,
[3079.30 --> 3080.78]  he's talking to the Gentiles in the crowd,
[3081.28 --> 3084.46]  you who are Gentiles by birth and called uncircumcised
[3084.46 --> 3088.16]  by those who call themselves a circumcision, the Jews,
[3088.58 --> 3090.90]  which is done in the body by human hands,
[3091.52 --> 3093.56]  remember that at that time, Gentiles,
[3093.70 --> 3095.52]  you were separate from Christ,
[3096.00 --> 3097.94]  excluded from citizenship in Israel,
[3098.42 --> 3099.90]  foreigners to the covenants of promise,
[3099.90 --> 3101.88]  without hope and without God in the world.
[3102.76 --> 3104.84]  It's a little awkward, right?
[3105.62 --> 3106.30]  To hear that.
[3107.82 --> 3109.40]  So what is Paul doing here?
[3110.72 --> 3114.66]  On one level, he is talking about these two categories of people,
[3114.84 --> 3117.84]  Jew and Gentile, circumcised and uncircumcised,
[3118.24 --> 3122.60]  and he's underscoring just how deep the barriers to peace have been.
[3122.60 --> 3127.22]  To the Gentile Christians, the non-Jewish Christians,
[3127.86 --> 3129.66]  he wants them to remember that they were,
[3130.32 --> 3133.40]  there was one time when they were separated from God.
[3133.64 --> 3134.82]  They didn't know God.
[3135.50 --> 3137.66]  They were separated from the people of God.
[3138.44 --> 3141.48]  There was a time when they were the ultimate outsider.
[3141.48 --> 3146.42]  And this is just referring to how God, in his own kindness,
[3147.30 --> 3150.68]  worked out his redemptive purposes through the Israelites.
[3151.64 --> 3151.82]  Right?
[3151.90 --> 3155.78]  God looked down on this big world that he had created and that he loves,
[3156.06 --> 3160.22]  but this world that had rebelled against him and was separated from him,
[3160.64 --> 3164.20]  and God, in his mercy, decided he is going to redeem a people.
[3165.02 --> 3167.34]  And those were the Old Testament Israelites.
[3167.34 --> 3172.12]  So the Gentiles are all the non-Jewish nations
[3172.12 --> 3177.18]  who weren't part of that chosen people of God and who didn't know God.
[3178.20 --> 3183.38]  And Paul says, remember that you were outside of Christ,
[3183.78 --> 3185.32]  that you were far away from God.
[3186.50 --> 3189.32]  But then, after talking to the Gentiles,
[3189.66 --> 3192.44]  remember who you were, he turns to the Jews.
[3193.56 --> 3195.84]  And notice how he addresses them.
[3195.84 --> 3200.88]  He calls them those who call themselves the circumcision,
[3201.52 --> 3204.58]  which is done in the body by human hands.
[3205.32 --> 3209.92]  And when Paul tells the Jews that their circumcision was only done by hands,
[3210.44 --> 3214.30]  he's saying that, okay, you know, you have the outward sign of the covenant,
[3214.68 --> 3218.78]  but they didn't have the true spiritual circumcision of the heart
[3218.78 --> 3222.60]  that God was looking for and that that outward sign pointed to.
[3222.60 --> 3227.98]  So in their hearts, they too were far removed from God.
[3228.30 --> 3234.14]  They're rejoicing and boasting in this physical sign that distinguishes them as God's people,
[3234.34 --> 3237.04]  but God is saying, your hearts were still far from me.
[3238.18 --> 3241.98]  And the Jews called the Gentiles the uncircumcision,
[3241.98 --> 3244.74]  in this derogatory kind of way.
[3245.90 --> 3250.20]  So this great gift and blessing that God gave the Jews of being God's people
[3250.20 --> 3255.56]  and being blessed with the law made them feel superior.
[3255.56 --> 3260.44]  And they felt that they were better than everybody else.
[3261.12 --> 3266.70]  So they began to look down on and despise those who didn't have that grace,
[3266.84 --> 3268.36]  that special relationship with God.
[3268.56 --> 3272.26]  That wasn't because of who they were, but simply because God chose them.
[3272.26 --> 3279.02]  But the thing is, from the very beginning, all the way back in Genesis chapter 12,
[3279.14 --> 3284.70]  God had made a covenant with them, and he wanted to bless them, the Jews,
[3285.10 --> 3289.94]  so that they would be a blessing to all the nations, right, to the Gentiles.
[3290.82 --> 3292.54]  That was why God chose them.
[3293.22 --> 3296.30]  It was never God's intent to only save the Jews.
[3296.30 --> 3301.50]  It was always God's intent to use the Jews as the first nation
[3301.50 --> 3305.70]  who would hold out the torch of light to the nations,
[3306.02 --> 3310.76]  to draw them in to know God, to worship God.
[3312.66 --> 3315.62]  And Paul is saying, you've not been doing this, right?
[3315.68 --> 3316.84]  You missed it the whole time.
[3316.92 --> 3319.88]  You've been making these walls, these walls of exclusion,
[3320.62 --> 3322.58]  but that wasn't what God intended.
[3323.80 --> 3326.14]  And this was a big problem for the Jews all along.
[3326.14 --> 3328.30]  Remember Jonah, Jonah the prophet.
[3328.60 --> 3329.86]  He got a word from the Lord.
[3330.02 --> 3332.54]  Jonah, I want you to go to that great city of Nineveh,
[3332.66 --> 3334.94]  and I want you to preach a message of repentance.
[3335.76 --> 3338.20]  I have decided I'm going to save Nineveh.
[3339.16 --> 3340.38]  This is my decision.
[3340.58 --> 3343.12]  All those souls in Nineveh, I want with me in heaven.
[3344.68 --> 3347.60]  Go there and preach repentance to them, Jonah.
[3348.44 --> 3349.36]  And what does Jonah do?
[3350.90 --> 3352.58]  Not on your life.
[3352.58 --> 3357.24]  He didn't want God to save those despicable Gentiles.
[3357.52 --> 3360.70]  So he went in another direction, and you know how that ended up.
[3360.94 --> 3361.80]  God got his way.
[3363.24 --> 3369.22]  And then Paul himself was very badly treated in Jerusalem at one point in his life.
[3369.64 --> 3373.36]  He had gone to Jerusalem with his gift of money for the saints in Jerusalem.
[3373.36 --> 3380.14]  And the reason the Jews hated Paul at this time of his life, when he was in Jerusalem,
[3380.40 --> 3383.06]  was that he was buddy with the Gentiles.
[3383.68 --> 3388.54]  So let's look at Acts chapter 21, verse 27 and following,
[3389.42 --> 3392.74]  where it tells us about the hostility that was shown to Paul
[3392.74 --> 3398.18]  because they thought he was bringing some Gentile buddies with him into Jerusalem
[3398.18 --> 3402.96]  and who dared cross that threshold, that trespass line.
[3403.64 --> 3407.26]  They thought Paul was taking Jews into the Jewish part of the temple.
[3408.46 --> 3409.38]  So let's read here.
[3409.60 --> 3411.34]  When the seven days were nearly over,
[3411.50 --> 3414.82]  some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple.
[3415.22 --> 3418.06]  They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
[3418.06 --> 3422.68]  shouting, fellow Israelites, help us.
[3423.16 --> 3427.46]  This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people
[3427.46 --> 3429.52]  and our law in this place.
[3430.12 --> 3434.06]  And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple
[3434.06 --> 3437.10]  and defiled this holy place.
[3437.76 --> 3442.10]  They had previously seen Trophimus, the Ephesian,
[3442.34 --> 3443.40]  in the city with Paul
[3443.40 --> 3446.82]  and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
[3448.06 --> 3451.34]  The whole city was aroused
[3451.34 --> 3453.82]  and the people came running from all directions.
[3454.12 --> 3456.24]  Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple
[3456.24 --> 3459.18]  and immediately the gates were shut.
[3461.42 --> 3463.90]  That's pretty extreme, right?
[3464.54 --> 3467.64]  What happened then was that Paul was rescued by Roman soldiers
[3467.64 --> 3470.06]  who rushed to the scene to figure out what is going on.
[3470.32 --> 3472.26]  They lift up Paul onto their shoulders.
[3472.26 --> 3474.38]  They carry him through the crowd to safety.
[3474.80 --> 3477.98]  But then Paul says, wait, let me talk to my people.
[3478.06 --> 3479.10]  So they say, okay.
[3479.22 --> 3480.82]  And Paul addresses the Jews.
[3481.82 --> 3483.44]  And so he did that.
[3483.58 --> 3487.00]  He told them his whole story of Jesus confronting him
[3487.00 --> 3488.12]  on the road to Damascus,
[3488.38 --> 3489.94]  saying, why are you persecuting me?
[3490.18 --> 3492.92]  And his calling to be a missionary to the Gentiles.
[3492.92 --> 3495.74]  So then, fast-forwarding through all that,
[3495.86 --> 3498.30]  chapter 22, Paul continues.
[3498.56 --> 3499.00]  He says,
[3499.64 --> 3500.90]  Then the Lord said to me,
[3501.04 --> 3503.80]  Go, I will send you far away to the Gentiles.
[3504.58 --> 3507.72]  The crowd listened to Paul until he said this.
[3508.40 --> 3510.44]  Then they raised their voices and shouted,
[3510.76 --> 3513.16]  Rid the earth of him, he is not fit to live.
[3513.88 --> 3514.86]  Why did he say that?
[3516.08 --> 3518.64]  Because he was called to the Gentiles.
[3518.64 --> 3523.08]  And I'm just telling you this to show you this history
[3523.08 --> 3527.74]  of this barrier between Jew and Gentile was so severe.
[3529.00 --> 3530.72]  Jews hated Gentiles.
[3531.56 --> 3534.24]  And they thought that they were God's special people.
[3534.68 --> 3537.50]  But they neglected or they misunderstood the fact
[3537.50 --> 3539.96]  that God called Israel into existence
[3539.96 --> 3542.32]  for the purpose of bearing a light to the nations
[3542.32 --> 3544.66]  rather than bearing a sword of judgment.
[3544.66 --> 3548.88]  And this division is represented by this dividing wall
[3548.88 --> 3551.30]  that Paul talks about in verse 14.
[3552.54 --> 3553.42]  He says,
[3553.62 --> 3557.42]  Jesus has destroyed the barrier,
[3557.90 --> 3560.18]  the dividing wall of hostility.
[3560.56 --> 3561.94]  And there's a little bit of mystery
[3561.94 --> 3563.52]  about what that wall is.
[3564.20 --> 3566.60]  Some think it may have to do with that temple access
[3566.60 --> 3567.54]  that we talked about,
[3567.94 --> 3570.16]  the wall that literally kept the Gentiles
[3570.16 --> 3572.54]  from getting closer to the place of God.
[3572.54 --> 3574.60]  And some think that it might be
[3574.60 --> 3576.00]  this more metaphorical language
[3576.00 --> 3578.58]  to describe the Jewish law and circumcision
[3578.58 --> 3580.44]  that Paul also talks about in this passage.
[3581.20 --> 3584.28]  These laws that distinguish us from them.
[3585.22 --> 3587.02]  But whatever it may be,
[3587.10 --> 3588.06]  it's probably both,
[3588.48 --> 3591.56]  the whole point is that Jesus is tearing it down.
[3592.28 --> 3594.44]  He's tearing down all of the divisions,
[3594.84 --> 3595.78]  all of the walls,
[3595.94 --> 3597.90]  to make Jew and Gentile
[3597.90 --> 3599.86]  into one new humanity
[3599.86 --> 3601.86]  called the church.
[3602.54 --> 3606.38]  Okay, and that leads us to the second point
[3606.38 --> 3607.54]  I want to talk about this morning,
[3607.64 --> 3609.38]  which is the basis of peace.
[3611.08 --> 3613.82]  So let's kind of zoom out
[3613.82 --> 3616.52]  and get our arms around this,
[3616.68 --> 3619.86]  that today the gospel is preached
[3619.86 --> 3621.74]  to Jew and Gentile.
[3621.74 --> 3628.28]  And any whom the Holy Spirit moves to respond to the gospel
[3628.28 --> 3630.42]  becomes a believer in Jesus Christ
[3630.42 --> 3633.80]  and simultaneously a brother or sister
[3633.80 --> 3635.92]  to all of us in faith.
[3636.60 --> 3638.40]  And it's the cross of Jesus Christ
[3638.40 --> 3639.50]  that removes the barrier.
[3639.90 --> 3642.48]  And there are two barriers that Jesus Christ removed.
[3642.84 --> 3644.84]  The barrier between us and God
[3644.84 --> 3648.22]  and the barrier between us and our neighbor.
[3648.68 --> 3649.34]  Okay, two barriers.
[3649.44 --> 3651.92]  The barrier vertically between us and God
[3651.92 --> 3652.56]  has been removed.
[3652.84 --> 3655.26]  And then the barrier horizontally between us and others
[3655.26 --> 3656.68]  has also been removed.
[3656.76 --> 3658.26]  And Paul talks about both of these.
[3658.90 --> 3661.18]  So the first wall Jesus destroyed
[3661.18 --> 3662.90]  was this spiritual dividing wall
[3662.90 --> 3665.26]  between God and sinners.
[3665.26 --> 3668.64]  And Paul underscores this in verse 13.
[3670.38 --> 3671.00]  He says,
[3671.78 --> 3673.28]  But now in Christ Jesus,
[3673.48 --> 3675.30]  you who were once far away
[3675.30 --> 3677.76]  have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[3679.94 --> 3681.48]  What a wonderful sentence.
[3682.88 --> 3683.74]  Read that again.
[3685.54 --> 3686.34]  But now.
[3687.10 --> 3687.92]  There's a big but.
[3689.00 --> 3691.14]  But now.
[3692.10 --> 3693.12]  In Christ Jesus,
[3693.12 --> 3695.28]  you who were once far away
[3695.28 --> 3696.86]  have been brought near
[3696.86 --> 3698.74]  by the blood of Christ.
[3699.14 --> 3700.74]  Brought near by the blood of Christ.
[3701.54 --> 3701.88]  Right, friends?
[3701.92 --> 3702.54]  That says it all.
[3702.62 --> 3703.66]  That is the gospel.
[3704.54 --> 3707.60]  It's all about being drawn near to God
[3707.60 --> 3710.62]  through someone who can pave the way for me.
[3711.16 --> 3713.72]  Because I can't get there on my own
[3713.72 --> 3715.36]  and Jesus paved the way.
[3715.78 --> 3716.78]  He died for me.
[3716.84 --> 3718.28]  His blood was spilt for me.
[3718.72 --> 3720.32]  I am brought near to God
[3720.32 --> 3721.78]  by the blood of his Son.
[3721.78 --> 3724.40]  And you can see how powerful
[3724.40 --> 3725.88]  this image was for Paul
[3725.88 --> 3728.20]  to speak of Jesus' death on the cross
[3728.20 --> 3729.60]  as destroying this barrier.
[3730.46 --> 3732.36]  And the barrier between us and God
[3732.36 --> 3734.94]  was represented by a physical barrier.
[3735.74 --> 3736.66]  It was represented
[3736.66 --> 3739.06]  by this huge curtain
[3739.06 --> 3740.68]  inside the temple
[3740.68 --> 3744.04]  that separated God from his people.
[3744.04 --> 3748.28]  And you know what happens.
[3748.98 --> 3750.62]  Just as Jesus Christ
[3750.62 --> 3751.58]  outside the cities
[3751.58 --> 3752.58]  dying on the cross
[3752.58 --> 3753.66]  at the very same time
[3753.66 --> 3755.28]  the curtain inside that temple
[3755.28 --> 3755.94]  that we saw
[3755.94 --> 3757.80]  was torn in half
[3757.80 --> 3759.20]  by God.
[3759.78 --> 3761.64]  Right, God reached down there himself
[3761.64 --> 3762.90]  he grabbed that curtain
[3762.90 --> 3763.56]  from the bottom
[3763.56 --> 3765.02]  and he tore it into two.
[3765.98 --> 3767.42]  And what was God saying?
[3767.50 --> 3768.64]  He's saying that at the cross
[3768.64 --> 3769.62]  where my Son
[3769.62 --> 3771.64]  bore the sins of the church
[3771.64 --> 3772.86]  I have removed
[3772.86 --> 3774.24]  that last dividing wall
[3774.24 --> 3775.26]  between you sinners
[3775.26 --> 3776.08]  and me.
[3777.20 --> 3778.04]  Right, and so
[3778.04 --> 3781.12]  God has this picture.
[3781.86 --> 3782.70]  He's looking down
[3782.70 --> 3783.66]  at the city of Jerusalem
[3783.66 --> 3785.22]  and he's saying
[3785.22 --> 3786.76]  all of these walls
[3786.76 --> 3789.14]  the temple gates
[3789.14 --> 3789.78]  the curtain
[3789.78 --> 3791.42]  the holy of holies
[3791.42 --> 3793.60]  it was all just to show you
[3793.60 --> 3795.10]  that there was a wall
[3795.10 --> 3796.14]  between me and you.
[3797.34 --> 3798.46]  And unless you follow
[3798.46 --> 3800.24]  the process of coming to me
[3800.24 --> 3801.42]  with animal sacrifices
[3801.42 --> 3802.74]  through a priest
[3802.74 --> 3805.00]  you have no access to me.
[3806.26 --> 3807.20]  But now
[3807.20 --> 3808.14]  God says
[3808.14 --> 3809.78]  the great high priest
[3809.78 --> 3810.58]  my son
[3810.58 --> 3811.68]  died on the cross
[3811.68 --> 3813.68]  my lamb was sacrificed
[3813.68 --> 3815.34]  and you now have
[3815.34 --> 3817.28]  direct access to me
[3817.28 --> 3819.26]  because of what he did for you.
[3820.50 --> 3820.76]  And so
[3820.76 --> 3821.54]  God says
[3821.54 --> 3823.00]  no more temples
[3823.00 --> 3824.58]  no more curtains
[3824.58 --> 3826.14]  no more animal blood
[3826.14 --> 3827.10]  no more priests
[3827.10 --> 3827.82]  none of that
[3827.82 --> 3828.50]  it's all gone.
[3828.50 --> 3829.00]  Jerusalem
[3829.00 --> 3830.10]  and then Paul could point
[3830.10 --> 3831.00]  back to Jerusalem
[3831.00 --> 3832.04]  and he can say
[3832.04 --> 3833.96]  the walls are destroyed.
[3834.66 --> 3836.22]  Jesus tore down the walls.
[3837.00 --> 3838.18]  The holy of holies is gone.
[3838.50 --> 3839.72]  The temple is gone.
[3840.00 --> 3841.14]  God removed it.
[3841.94 --> 3842.72]  Let the Muslims
[3842.72 --> 3843.54]  have their thing.
[3844.26 --> 3845.64]  We don't need it anymore
[3845.64 --> 3847.24]  because God
[3847.24 --> 3848.44]  through Jesus Christ
[3848.44 --> 3849.16]  has made peace
[3849.16 --> 3849.94]  between us
[3849.94 --> 3850.72]  and him.
[3852.58 --> 3853.64]  And not only though
[3853.64 --> 3854.20]  is this passage
[3854.20 --> 3855.14]  talking about bringing
[3855.14 --> 3855.72]  souls
[3855.72 --> 3856.34]  lost souls
[3856.34 --> 3857.04]  to God
[3857.04 --> 3858.00]  but also about
[3858.00 --> 3858.68]  bringing Jew
[3858.68 --> 3859.38]  and Gentile
[3859.38 --> 3860.24]  together.
[3861.24 --> 3862.18]  Look at what Paul
[3862.18 --> 3862.78]  then says
[3862.78 --> 3863.60]  in verse 14.
[3866.76 --> 3867.42]  He says
[3867.42 --> 3868.50]  for he himself
[3868.50 --> 3869.14]  Jesus
[3869.14 --> 3870.32]  is our peace
[3870.32 --> 3872.02]  who has made
[3872.02 --> 3872.96]  the two groups
[3872.96 --> 3873.88]  Jew and Gentile
[3873.88 --> 3874.64]  one
[3874.64 --> 3875.54]  has destroyed
[3875.54 --> 3876.16]  the barrier
[3876.16 --> 3877.20]  the dividing wall
[3877.20 --> 3878.14]  of hostility.
[3879.52 --> 3879.64]  Right?
[3879.70 --> 3880.28]  And so just as
[3880.28 --> 3881.32]  there is no peace
[3881.32 --> 3882.60]  between God
[3882.60 --> 3883.40]  and humanity
[3883.40 --> 3884.54]  without Jesus Christ
[3884.54 --> 3885.46]  there is never
[3885.46 --> 3886.22]  going to be peace
[3886.22 --> 3887.12]  horizontally
[3887.12 --> 3888.82]  amongst people
[3888.82 --> 3889.64]  in this world
[3889.64 --> 3891.18]  without Jesus Christ.
[3892.70 --> 3893.90]  Human beings
[3893.90 --> 3894.86]  are sinful.
[3895.30 --> 3896.20]  That is never
[3896.20 --> 3897.22]  going to change.
[3898.40 --> 3899.34]  There is no
[3899.34 --> 3900.08]  prime minister
[3900.08 --> 3901.72]  or president
[3901.72 --> 3902.64]  or king
[3902.64 --> 3903.92]  or policy
[3903.92 --> 3904.86]  or military
[3904.86 --> 3905.88]  or weapon
[3905.88 --> 3907.28]  or United Nations
[3907.28 --> 3908.76]  or any ideology
[3908.76 --> 3910.26]  no matter how
[3910.26 --> 3910.94]  enlightened
[3910.94 --> 3912.26]  or refined
[3912.26 --> 3912.98]  it is
[3912.98 --> 3914.04]  that can produce
[3914.04 --> 3915.06]  the peace
[3915.06 --> 3916.22]  that we need.
[3917.22 --> 3917.92]  There is nothing
[3917.92 --> 3918.88]  but Christ alone
[3918.88 --> 3919.58]  that can bring
[3919.58 --> 3920.86]  everlasting peace.
[3921.82 --> 3922.58]  And once that
[3922.58 --> 3923.78]  greatest barrier
[3923.78 --> 3924.68]  has been removed
[3924.68 --> 3925.16]  the barrier
[3925.16 --> 3926.12]  between us
[3926.12 --> 3926.60]  and God
[3926.60 --> 3927.50]  that God
[3927.50 --> 3928.24]  removed
[3928.24 --> 3928.82]  by the death
[3928.82 --> 3929.36]  of his son
[3929.36 --> 3930.12]  for us
[3930.12 --> 3932.16]  once that barrier
[3932.16 --> 3932.68]  is removed
[3932.68 --> 3934.26]  all other barriers
[3934.26 --> 3935.02]  between us
[3935.02 --> 3935.84]  and other people
[3935.84 --> 3937.04]  go away as well.
[3938.16 --> 3938.40]  Right?
[3938.44 --> 3938.82]  The message
[3938.82 --> 3939.36]  of the gospel
[3939.36 --> 3940.76]  is that if God
[3940.76 --> 3941.78]  can forgive
[3941.78 --> 3942.48]  your sin
[3942.48 --> 3943.34]  Jew and Gentile
[3943.34 --> 3943.78]  you Jew
[3943.78 --> 3944.42]  you Gentile
[3944.42 --> 3945.44]  God can forgive
[3945.44 --> 3946.34]  your sin
[3946.34 --> 3948.40]  and draw you
[3948.40 --> 3949.32]  into his kingdom
[3949.32 --> 3949.98]  and make you
[3949.98 --> 3951.00]  his sons and daughters
[3951.00 --> 3951.64]  by adoption
[3951.64 --> 3952.92]  there is nothing
[3952.92 --> 3954.14]  between you
[3954.14 --> 3955.60]  that is more
[3955.60 --> 3956.24]  important
[3956.24 --> 3957.24]  than what you
[3957.24 --> 3958.74]  have together
[3958.74 --> 3960.38]  through faith
[3960.38 --> 3961.24]  in Jesus Christ.
[3962.44 --> 3962.98]  Right?
[3963.02 --> 3963.60]  Because anybody
[3963.60 --> 3964.52]  who is your brother
[3964.52 --> 3965.66]  or sister in Christ
[3965.66 --> 3967.72]  you are united with
[3967.72 --> 3969.12]  and it doesn't matter
[3969.12 --> 3970.14]  what their education
[3970.14 --> 3970.82]  level is
[3970.82 --> 3971.74]  it doesn't matter
[3971.74 --> 3972.40]  what country
[3972.40 --> 3972.98]  they come
[3972.98 --> 3974.06]  how much money
[3974.06 --> 3974.76]  they make
[3974.76 --> 3976.28]  what their former
[3976.28 --> 3977.20]  beliefs were
[3977.20 --> 3978.44]  what their past
[3978.44 --> 3979.46]  life was like
[3979.46 --> 3980.94]  none of that matters.
[3982.42 --> 3982.90]  And you
[3982.90 --> 3984.12]  maybe you've experienced
[3984.12 --> 3985.14]  this maybe you've met
[3985.14 --> 3986.12]  another brother
[3986.12 --> 3986.82]  or sister from
[3986.82 --> 3987.74]  another part of the world
[3987.74 --> 3989.26]  and you feel
[3989.26 --> 3990.08]  there's an instant
[3990.08 --> 3991.84]  unity with that person
[3991.84 --> 3993.02]  it's like spirit
[3993.02 --> 3994.14]  speaking to spirit
[3994.14 --> 3995.38]  and you know
[3995.38 --> 3997.64]  and you don't even need
[3997.64 --> 3998.66]  a long introduction
[3998.66 --> 3999.34]  it doesn't matter
[3999.34 --> 4000.40]  where they were born
[4000.40 --> 4001.96]  because you both know
[4001.96 --> 4002.64]  that your sins
[4002.64 --> 4003.18]  were forgiven
[4003.18 --> 4004.04]  on the cross.
[4004.90 --> 4005.36]  Right?
[4005.42 --> 4006.10]  And you know that
[4006.10 --> 4007.38]  that is the best news
[4007.38 --> 4008.50]  that you have ever heard
[4008.50 --> 4009.96]  you know it's the best news
[4009.96 --> 4011.08]  that they have ever heard
[4011.08 --> 4013.32]  and you share faith
[4013.32 --> 4014.12]  in one God
[4014.12 --> 4016.22]  and you share a place
[4016.22 --> 4017.80]  in his one family.
[4018.80 --> 4020.00]  That is the unity
[4020.00 --> 4020.74]  that comes
[4020.74 --> 4022.34]  through the cross
[4022.34 --> 4023.88]  and the basis
[4023.88 --> 4024.54]  of our peace
[4024.54 --> 4025.48]  is Jesus Christ.
[4026.52 --> 4026.76]  And friends
[4026.76 --> 4027.62]  that is the only thing
[4027.62 --> 4028.16]  that can remove
[4028.16 --> 4029.04]  hatred in this world.
[4030.46 --> 4031.26]  And that leads us
[4031.26 --> 4032.52]  just to the final reflection
[4032.52 --> 4033.66]  of Paul's
[4033.66 --> 4034.30]  in this passage.
[4034.78 --> 4035.44]  He talks about
[4035.44 --> 4036.62]  the barriers to peace
[4036.62 --> 4037.52]  but then he talks
[4037.52 --> 4038.24]  about the basis
[4038.24 --> 4038.80]  of peace
[4038.80 --> 4039.90]  which is Jesus Christ
[4039.90 --> 4042.88]  and then he invites us
[4042.88 --> 4043.82]  to dream
[4043.82 --> 4045.08]  and get excited
[4045.08 --> 4046.88]  about the blessings
[4046.88 --> 4048.06]  of being a peacemaker.
[4049.02 --> 4049.20]  Okay?
[4049.24 --> 4049.70]  The blessings
[4049.70 --> 4050.56]  of being a peacemaker.
[4051.38 --> 4052.70]  So let's put up
[4052.70 --> 4053.92]  the next passage there
[4053.92 --> 4054.78]  Andrew.
[4054.92 --> 4055.22]  Thanks.
[4056.68 --> 4057.34]  Blessings of being
[4057.34 --> 4057.88]  a peacemaker.
[4058.26 --> 4058.82]  And then listen to
[4058.82 --> 4059.22]  what he says
[4059.22 --> 4061.14]  in verses 17 and 18 there.
[4062.34 --> 4062.76]  He says
[4062.76 --> 4064.74]  he, that's Jesus,
[4065.38 --> 4066.02]  he came
[4066.02 --> 4066.98]  and preached
[4066.98 --> 4067.76]  peace to you
[4067.76 --> 4068.46]  who are far away.
[4069.02 --> 4069.58]  Who is that?
[4070.86 --> 4071.34]  Gentiles.
[4071.78 --> 4072.80]  And peace to you
[4072.80 --> 4073.30]  who are near.
[4073.74 --> 4074.22]  The Jews.
[4074.88 --> 4075.74]  For through him
[4075.74 --> 4077.06]  we both have access
[4077.06 --> 4077.68]  to the Father
[4077.68 --> 4078.42]  by one spirit.
[4078.42 --> 4080.26]  Paul here
[4080.26 --> 4081.04]  is talking about
[4081.04 --> 4082.06]  Jesus' own
[4082.06 --> 4083.20]  messianic ministry
[4083.20 --> 4084.36]  as foretold
[4084.36 --> 4085.68]  by the prophet Isaiah
[4085.68 --> 4086.98]  where he went
[4086.98 --> 4087.58]  around the land
[4087.58 --> 4087.92]  of Israel
[4087.92 --> 4089.34]  preaching the gospel
[4089.34 --> 4089.86]  of peace
[4089.86 --> 4090.50]  to both Jew
[4090.50 --> 4091.08]  and Gentile.
[4091.16 --> 4091.88]  That's what Jesus did.
[4092.48 --> 4092.92]  And now
[4092.92 --> 4093.64]  as the body
[4093.64 --> 4094.18]  of Christ
[4094.18 --> 4095.02]  as the church
[4095.02 --> 4095.84]  we take up
[4095.84 --> 4096.44]  the mission
[4096.44 --> 4097.76]  of Jesus Christ
[4097.76 --> 4098.24]  our Lord
[4098.24 --> 4098.82]  and we go
[4098.82 --> 4099.52]  and we preach
[4099.52 --> 4100.30]  the gospel
[4100.30 --> 4100.90]  of peace.
[4102.70 --> 4103.58]  And remember
[4103.58 --> 4104.30]  that's the calling
[4104.30 --> 4105.12]  that Paul himself
[4105.12 --> 4106.40]  had received.
[4106.40 --> 4109.18]  Think of the job
[4109.18 --> 4110.28]  that Paul
[4110.28 --> 4111.38]  had before him.
[4112.02 --> 4113.06]  Preaching to a
[4113.06 --> 4114.02]  Gentile world.
[4114.68 --> 4115.82]  Gentiles knew
[4115.82 --> 4116.82]  that Jews
[4116.82 --> 4117.48]  hated them
[4117.48 --> 4118.92]  and they knew
[4118.92 --> 4119.34]  that Paul
[4119.34 --> 4119.86]  was a Jew.
[4120.56 --> 4121.92]  And God sent him
[4121.92 --> 4122.84]  to preach
[4122.84 --> 4124.86]  to the Gentiles.
[4125.56 --> 4126.56]  And the message
[4126.56 --> 4127.44]  is that there is
[4127.44 --> 4127.98]  no Jew
[4127.98 --> 4128.62]  and Gentile
[4128.62 --> 4129.20]  when it comes
[4129.20 --> 4129.66]  to the grace
[4129.66 --> 4130.10]  of God.
[4131.02 --> 4131.32]  And so when
[4131.32 --> 4132.00]  the apostle Paul
[4132.00 --> 4132.74]  who is a Jew
[4132.74 --> 4134.18]  went into
[4134.18 --> 4135.14]  a Gentile world
[4135.14 --> 4136.98]  and he said
[4136.98 --> 4138.10]  a Jewish Messiah
[4138.10 --> 4138.76]  loves you
[4138.76 --> 4140.08]  and he has
[4140.08 --> 4141.02]  died for you
[4141.02 --> 4141.90]  and it was
[4141.90 --> 4142.70]  always God's
[4142.70 --> 4143.42]  plan to pull
[4143.42 --> 4144.56]  down this wall
[4144.56 --> 4145.66]  so that the love
[4145.66 --> 4146.12]  of God
[4146.12 --> 4146.76]  could remove
[4146.76 --> 4147.52]  the hostility.
[4147.92 --> 4149.02]  That was a tough
[4149.02 --> 4149.54]  message
[4149.54 --> 4152.10]  for a Gentile
[4152.10 --> 4152.54]  to hear.
[4155.12 --> 4156.08]  And only
[4156.08 --> 4156.94]  by the grace
[4156.94 --> 4157.46]  of God
[4157.46 --> 4158.08]  and the power
[4158.08 --> 4158.98]  of the Holy Spirit
[4158.98 --> 4159.78]  was it successful.
[4161.06 --> 4161.92]  So here's the
[4161.92 --> 4162.48]  question friends.
[4162.66 --> 4163.16]  What does it mean
[4163.16 --> 4164.12]  for us to pursue
[4164.12 --> 4164.60]  peace?
[4165.74 --> 4166.44]  Well I want
[4166.44 --> 4167.28]  to illustrate it
[4167.28 --> 4169.06]  with a story
[4169.06 --> 4170.02]  that I read recently.
[4170.68 --> 4171.34]  The story
[4171.34 --> 4172.26]  is told by
[4172.26 --> 4173.90]  Johanna Katanocho
[4173.90 --> 4174.96]  who is a
[4174.96 --> 4176.00]  Palestinian Christian.
[4176.88 --> 4177.70]  He teaches
[4177.70 --> 4178.44]  at Bethlehem
[4178.44 --> 4179.14]  Bible College
[4179.14 --> 4180.30]  and he tells
[4180.30 --> 4181.26]  about his own
[4181.26 --> 4181.80]  journey
[4181.80 --> 4183.92]  of peacemaking.
[4184.54 --> 4185.22]  So I want
[4185.22 --> 4185.74]  to just read
[4185.74 --> 4186.38]  this for you
[4186.38 --> 4187.46]  and then we
[4187.46 --> 4188.00]  will close.
[4190.00 --> 4190.74]  So he tells
[4190.74 --> 4191.18]  this story
[4191.18 --> 4191.74]  in this book
[4191.74 --> 4192.74]  The Land of Christ
[4192.74 --> 4193.78]  A Palestinian Cry.
[4194.12 --> 4198.80]  Here's his story.
[4199.38 --> 4200.32]  It was nearly
[4200.32 --> 4200.78]  midnight
[4200.78 --> 4202.52]  when I closed
[4202.52 --> 4203.16]  up the office
[4203.16 --> 4203.98]  of the church
[4203.98 --> 4204.58]  in Jerusalem,
[4205.72 --> 4206.68]  stuffed the stack
[4206.68 --> 4207.50]  of pamphlets
[4207.50 --> 4208.30]  I had just
[4208.30 --> 4209.40]  finished photocopying
[4209.40 --> 4210.74]  inside my jacket
[4210.74 --> 4212.34]  and began
[4212.34 --> 4213.54]  an uneasy
[4213.54 --> 4214.66]  walk home.
[4215.40 --> 4216.10]  In the late
[4216.10 --> 4217.24]  1980s
[4217.24 --> 4218.56]  under a new
[4218.56 --> 4219.46]  Israeli law
[4219.46 --> 4220.88]  if an Israeli
[4220.88 --> 4221.96]  soldier called
[4221.96 --> 4222.56]  out to a
[4222.56 --> 4223.10]  Palestinian
[4223.10 --> 4224.08]  and the
[4224.08 --> 4224.58]  Palestinian
[4224.58 --> 4225.18]  did not
[4225.18 --> 4225.78]  respond
[4225.78 --> 4226.98]  the soldier
[4226.98 --> 4227.74]  could consider
[4227.74 --> 4228.52]  that person
[4228.52 --> 4229.34]  a political
[4229.34 --> 4229.96]  fanatic
[4229.96 --> 4230.52]  and shoot
[4230.52 --> 4230.78]  him.
[4231.86 --> 4232.56]  During that
[4232.56 --> 4233.20]  time many
[4233.20 --> 4233.90]  Palestinians
[4233.90 --> 4234.74]  distributed
[4234.74 --> 4236.26]  political flyers
[4236.26 --> 4236.96]  challenging
[4236.96 --> 4237.60]  the authority
[4237.60 --> 4238.18]  of the Israeli
[4238.18 --> 4238.60]  government.
[4238.60 --> 4241.00]  as I neared
[4241.00 --> 4241.76]  the Damascus
[4241.76 --> 4242.16]  gate
[4242.16 --> 4243.30]  I saw
[4243.30 --> 4244.14]  three Israeli
[4244.14 --> 4244.74]  soldiers
[4244.74 --> 4245.78]  standing in the
[4245.78 --> 4246.10]  shadows
[4246.10 --> 4246.76]  watching me.
[4247.92 --> 4248.94]  One soldier
[4248.94 --> 4249.82]  lifted a hand
[4249.82 --> 4250.22]  and crooked
[4250.22 --> 4250.82]  his finger
[4250.82 --> 4252.00]  commanding me
[4252.00 --> 4252.58]  to approach.
[4253.74 --> 4254.72]  There was no one
[4254.72 --> 4255.52]  else in sight
[4255.52 --> 4256.84]  and as I
[4256.84 --> 4257.48]  approached the
[4257.48 --> 4257.86]  soldiers
[4257.86 --> 4258.36]  my heart
[4258.36 --> 4258.92]  pounded
[4258.92 --> 4260.02]  and I began
[4260.02 --> 4260.52]  to pray.
[4261.34 --> 4262.18]  Without thinking
[4262.18 --> 4262.94]  I rapidly
[4262.94 --> 4263.74]  unzipped my
[4263.74 --> 4264.14]  jacket
[4264.14 --> 4265.62]  and just
[4265.62 --> 4266.16]  as quickly
[4266.16 --> 4267.10]  found three
[4267.10 --> 4267.76]  machine guns
[4267.76 --> 4268.28]  aimed at my
[4268.28 --> 4268.56]  head.
[4269.66 --> 4270.56]  I stared
[4270.56 --> 4270.86]  at the
[4270.86 --> 4271.20]  soldiers.
[4272.22 --> 4272.76]  I had seen
[4272.76 --> 4273.46]  many soldiers
[4273.46 --> 4274.00]  who looked
[4274.00 --> 4274.56]  just like
[4274.56 --> 4275.06]  these men
[4275.06 --> 4276.40]  mocking the
[4276.40 --> 4277.00]  students at
[4277.00 --> 4277.44]  Bethlehem
[4277.44 --> 4278.02]  University
[4278.02 --> 4279.42]  forcing them
[4279.42 --> 4279.80]  to stay
[4279.80 --> 4280.32]  indoors
[4280.32 --> 4281.04]  during a
[4281.04 --> 4281.78]  sudden curfew
[4281.78 --> 4282.08]  that could
[4282.08 --> 4282.42]  last for
[4282.42 --> 4282.84]  weeks
[4282.84 --> 4284.48]  allowing no
[4284.48 --> 4284.98]  possibility
[4284.98 --> 4285.76]  to work
[4285.76 --> 4287.06]  buy food
[4287.06 --> 4287.44]  or get
[4287.44 --> 4287.76]  medical
[4287.76 --> 4288.16]  attention.
[4289.16 --> 4290.00]  I looked
[4290.00 --> 4290.34]  at them
[4290.34 --> 4290.72]  and raised
[4290.72 --> 4291.18]  my hand
[4291.18 --> 4291.52]  to my
[4291.52 --> 4291.94]  chest.
[4291.94 --> 4293.94]  I have
[4293.94 --> 4294.42]  a heart
[4294.42 --> 4294.90]  here
[4294.90 --> 4295.48]  that loves
[4295.48 --> 4295.70]  you.
[4296.58 --> 4297.02]  I told
[4297.02 --> 4297.28]  them.
[4298.36 --> 4299.04]  For a
[4299.04 --> 4299.48]  moment the
[4299.48 --> 4300.18]  three soldiers
[4300.18 --> 4300.96]  stared at
[4300.96 --> 4301.64]  me shocked.
[4302.36 --> 4302.82]  I was
[4302.82 --> 4303.38]  shocked too.
[4304.78 --> 4305.34]  Slowly they
[4305.34 --> 4305.96]  lowered their
[4305.96 --> 4306.60]  guns and we
[4306.60 --> 4307.08]  began to
[4307.08 --> 4307.70]  talk together.
[4308.96 --> 4309.62]  After 20
[4309.62 --> 4310.46]  minutes one
[4310.46 --> 4311.02]  soldier told
[4311.02 --> 4312.14]  me I
[4312.14 --> 4312.52]  wish that
[4312.52 --> 4313.36]  all Palestinians
[4313.36 --> 4313.92]  were like
[4313.92 --> 4314.16]  you.
[4315.34 --> 4315.78]  No I
[4315.78 --> 4316.44]  replied I
[4316.44 --> 4316.92]  wish they
[4316.92 --> 4317.98]  were that
[4317.98 --> 4318.30]  you were
[4318.30 --> 4318.82]  like me.
[4320.36 --> 4321.34]  That incident
[4321.34 --> 4321.96]  helped me
[4321.96 --> 4322.46]  to reflect
[4322.46 --> 4322.92]  on how
[4322.92 --> 4323.62]  Christ had
[4323.62 --> 4324.22]  changed me.
[4325.12 --> 4325.64]  Only two
[4325.64 --> 4326.48]  years earlier
[4326.48 --> 4327.36]  Christ's
[4327.36 --> 4327.92]  command in
[4327.92 --> 4328.32]  the Sermon
[4328.32 --> 4328.58]  on the
[4328.58 --> 4329.30]  Mount to
[4329.30 --> 4329.74]  love your
[4329.74 --> 4330.28]  enemies
[4330.28 --> 4331.26]  seemed
[4331.26 --> 4332.18]  impossible to
[4332.18 --> 4332.36]  me.
[4333.50 --> 4333.96]  And yet
[4333.96 --> 4334.32]  there it
[4334.32 --> 4335.28]  was unambiguous
[4335.28 --> 4336.78]  and unchanging.
[4337.90 --> 4338.88]  For me
[4338.88 --> 4340.46]  love was an
[4340.46 --> 4341.32]  active decision
[4341.32 --> 4342.96]  counter to
[4342.96 --> 4343.50]  the culture
[4343.50 --> 4344.02]  in which I
[4344.02 --> 4344.40]  lived.
[4344.96 --> 4345.52]  A culture
[4345.52 --> 4346.22]  where hatred
[4346.22 --> 4346.92]  of others
[4346.92 --> 4347.44]  abounded.
[4348.20 --> 4348.92]  Fueled by the
[4348.92 --> 4349.56]  circumstances
[4349.56 --> 4350.08]  of daily
[4350.08 --> 4350.74]  life, the
[4350.74 --> 4351.06]  media,
[4351.24 --> 4352.64]  attitudes, all
[4352.64 --> 4353.50]  contributing to
[4353.50 --> 4354.48]  the alienation
[4354.48 --> 4355.78]  of both Israeli
[4355.78 --> 4356.58]  Jews and
[4356.58 --> 4357.62]  Palestinian Arabs.
[4358.22 --> 4359.08]  To overcome
[4359.08 --> 4360.04]  this alienation
[4360.04 --> 4360.64]  and hatred
[4360.64 --> 4362.04]  I needed
[4362.04 --> 4363.02]  a profound
[4363.02 --> 4363.80]  change.
[4365.08 --> 4366.28]  At first I
[4366.28 --> 4367.50]  tried but
[4367.50 --> 4368.28]  failed in my
[4368.28 --> 4368.82]  attempts to
[4368.82 --> 4369.42]  feel love.
[4370.48 --> 4370.80]  Israeli
[4370.80 --> 4371.52]  soldiers would
[4371.52 --> 4372.60]  stop Palestinians
[4372.60 --> 4373.66]  daily at
[4373.66 --> 4374.46]  random and
[4374.46 --> 4375.10]  ask for their
[4375.10 --> 4376.26]  identification cards
[4376.26 --> 4377.54]  sometimes detaining
[4377.54 --> 4378.48]  them for hours.
[4379.74 --> 4380.90]  These experiences
[4380.90 --> 4382.08]  fueled my fear
[4382.08 --> 4382.78]  and anger.
[4383.42 --> 4384.52]  As I confessed
[4384.52 --> 4385.38]  my inability
[4385.38 --> 4386.22]  to love to
[4386.22 --> 4387.72]  God I realized
[4387.72 --> 4388.66]  something significant.
[4389.62 --> 4390.24]  The radical
[4390.24 --> 4391.24]  love of Christ
[4391.24 --> 4391.82]  is not an
[4391.82 --> 4393.00]  emotion but
[4393.00 --> 4393.52]  a decision.
[4394.22 --> 4395.16]  I decided
[4395.16 --> 4396.22]  to show love
[4396.22 --> 4397.88]  however reluctantly
[4397.88 --> 4399.46]  by sharing the
[4399.46 --> 4400.32]  gospel message
[4400.32 --> 4401.20]  with the soldiers
[4401.20 --> 4401.86]  on the street.
[4402.54 --> 4403.10]  With new
[4403.10 --> 4404.38]  resolve I began
[4404.38 --> 4405.42]  to carry tracks
[4405.42 --> 4406.40]  written in
[4406.40 --> 4407.02]  Hebrew and
[4407.02 --> 4408.00]  English with
[4408.00 --> 4408.56]  a quotation
[4408.56 --> 4409.22]  from Isaiah
[4409.22 --> 4410.82]  53 and the
[4410.82 --> 4411.94]  words real love
[4411.94 --> 4412.70]  printed across
[4412.70 --> 4413.16]  the top.
[4414.24 --> 4415.10]  Every time a
[4415.10 --> 4415.68]  soldier stopped
[4415.68 --> 4416.32]  me I handed
[4416.32 --> 4417.22]  him both my
[4417.22 --> 4418.44]  ID card and
[4418.44 --> 4418.92]  a track.
[4419.88 --> 4420.40]  Because the
[4420.40 --> 4421.30]  quote came from
[4421.30 --> 4421.66]  the Hebrew
[4421.66 --> 4423.08]  scriptures the
[4423.08 --> 4423.82]  soldiers usually
[4423.82 --> 4424.80]  asked me about
[4424.80 --> 4425.50]  it before letting
[4425.50 --> 4425.88]  me go.
[4426.82 --> 4427.48]  After several
[4427.48 --> 4428.16]  months of this
[4428.16 --> 4429.66]  I suddenly realized
[4429.66 --> 4430.48]  that my feelings
[4430.48 --> 4430.94]  toward the
[4430.94 --> 4431.70]  soldiers had
[4431.70 --> 4432.12]  changed.
[4432.92 --> 4433.70]  I was surprised.
[4433.70 --> 4435.66]  It was a process
[4435.66 --> 4436.74]  that I had been
[4436.74 --> 4438.56]  unaware of but
[4438.56 --> 4439.32]  my former
[4439.32 --> 4440.56]  feelings were
[4440.56 --> 4440.90]  gone.
[4441.64 --> 4442.54]  I would pass
[4442.54 --> 4443.14]  the same way
[4443.14 --> 4443.62]  and see the
[4443.62 --> 4444.20]  same soldiers
[4444.20 --> 4444.98]  as before but
[4444.98 --> 4445.60]  now I found
[4445.60 --> 4446.26]  myself praying
[4446.26 --> 4447.24]  Lord let them
[4447.24 --> 4448.70]  stop me so I
[4448.70 --> 4449.56]  can share with
[4449.56 --> 4450.60]  them the love
[4450.60 --> 4451.06]  of Christ.
[4452.84 --> 4453.62]  Let's pray.
[4453.62 --> 4458.52]  Father we

[4459.12 --> 4459.86]  you are the

[4462.22 --> 4463.00]  government of

[4464.22 --> 4465.00]  there will be
[4465.00 --> 4465.86]  no end.
[4467.40 --> 4468.10]  Father we
[4468.10 --> 4469.08]  thank you for
[4469.08 --> 4469.66]  the blood of
[4469.66 --> 4471.30]  Christ by which
[4471.30 --> 4471.80]  we can draw
[4471.80 --> 4473.64]  near to our
[4473.64 --> 4474.26]  heavenly father
[4474.26 --> 4476.10]  and we thank
[4476.10 --> 4476.48]  you for the
[4476.48 --> 4477.10]  blood of Christ
[4477.10 --> 4477.74]  that also tore
[4477.74 --> 4478.16]  down the
[4478.16 --> 4478.76]  dividing walls
[4478.76 --> 4479.50]  between us
[4479.50 --> 4480.72]  and people.
[4480.72 --> 4483.66]  So Lord
[4483.66 --> 4484.44]  help us to
[4484.44 --> 4484.98]  follow you
[4484.98 --> 4485.60]  our prince of
[4485.60 --> 4486.14]  peace and
[4486.14 --> 4486.86]  proclaiming a
[4486.86 --> 4487.42]  gospel of
[4487.42 --> 4487.76]  peace.
[4488.44 --> 4489.56]  Help us to
[4489.56 --> 4491.20]  pursue peace
[4491.20 --> 4491.70]  with others
[4491.70 --> 4492.26]  whoever those
[4492.26 --> 4492.82]  are Lord you
[4492.82 --> 4493.32]  know each one
[4493.32 --> 4493.98]  of our hearts
[4493.98 --> 4494.52]  you know the
[4494.52 --> 4495.34]  barriers that
[4495.34 --> 4496.24]  might exist
[4496.24 --> 4496.88]  between us
[4496.88 --> 4497.40]  and others
[4497.40 --> 4499.06]  but Lord
[4499.06 --> 4499.90]  because of the
[4499.90 --> 4500.48]  peace that you
[4500.48 --> 4500.86]  have already
[4500.86 --> 4501.72]  accomplished there
[4501.72 --> 4502.44]  is no barrier
[4502.44 --> 4503.02]  that you cannot
[4503.02 --> 4503.50]  overcome.
[4504.68 --> 4505.10]  And so Lord
[4505.10 --> 4505.64]  would you help
[4505.64 --> 4506.96]  us be
[4506.96 --> 4507.66]  peacemakers
[4507.66 --> 4508.98]  in the place
[4508.98 --> 4509.96]  each place
[4509.96 --> 4510.26]  where you
[4510.26 --> 4510.98]  have put us.
[4511.48 --> 4512.02]  We pray for
[4512.02 --> 4512.46]  your help
[4512.46 --> 4513.16]  by the spirit
[4513.16 --> 4513.92]  in Jesus name.
[4514.34 --> 4514.58]  Amen.
[4516.48 --> 4517.10]  All right so
[4517.10 --> 4517.58]  let's sing our
[4517.58 --> 4518.52]  song of response.
[4519.16 --> 4519.58]  They'll know
[4519.58 --> 4520.32]  we are Christians.
[4520.32 --> 4541.02]  we are one in the
[4541.02 --> 4541.58]  spirit
[4541.58 --> 4544.22]  we are one in the

[4554.06 --> 4555.46]  may one day

[4588.04 --> 4589.78]  and they'll know
[4589.78 --> 4591.32]  we are Christians

[4613.14 --> 4614.94]  and we'll guard
[4614.94 --> 4616.46]  human dignity
[4616.46 --> 4617.98]  and save
[4617.98 --> 4619.30]  human lives

[4641.24 --> 4644.76]  Jesus his only Son
[4644.76 --> 4648.32]  and all praise to the Spirit
[4648.32 --> 4651.02]  who makes us one

[4678.80 --> 4680.24]  this morning
[4680.24 --> 4681.16]  is for the
[4681.16 --> 4682.08]  world renew
[4682.08 --> 4682.90]  program
[4682.90 --> 4684.08]  called clean water
[4684.08 --> 4686.14]  a very worthwhile endeavor
[4686.14 --> 4686.84]  to bring
[4686.84 --> 4689.06]  safe water supply
[4689.06 --> 4690.08]  something we
[4690.08 --> 4691.38]  all too often take for granted
[4691.38 --> 4692.04]  at least myself
[4692.04 --> 4694.08]  to people who don't have that
[4694.08 --> 4696.08]  so I invite the deacons
[4696.08 --> 4696.46]  to come forward
[4696.46 --> 4697.02]  and take our offerings
[4697.02 --> 4697.58]  at this time
[4697.58 --> 4702.68]  so I want to dział
[4702.68 --> 4704.26]  and I'd like torah
[4704.26 --> 4704.66]  through that
[4704.66 --> 4704.88]  and I ld
[4704.88 --> 4710.34]  and I'll see you
[4710.34 --> 4740.32]  Thank you.
[4740.34 --> 4770.32]  Thank you.
[4770.34 --> 4800.32]  Thank you.
[4800.34 --> 4802.34]  Thank you.
[4811.62 --> 4813.76]  Let's join together in prayers.
[4813.76 --> 4822.20]  Father, you are great and glorious and eternal.
[4822.86 --> 4826.48]  It's good to spend time worshipping you both with song and word this morning.
[4826.48 --> 4843.66]  And we pray that even as we offer our praise to you, you will in turn work in our hearts, fill us with your spirit, and transform us into your image, ready, willing, and eager to do your will and advance your kingdom right here in Ladner.
[4843.66 --> 4854.74]  We give thanks for the message from Pastor Jason this morning and the reminder that through Christ, the walls that separate us from you have been torn down.
[4855.10 --> 4859.98]  And the barriers separating us from those around us so often have also been removed.
[4859.98 --> 4862.06]  And we thank you for that blessing.
[4863.38 --> 4868.82]  We give thanks for the work of all those that made our recent His Descendants camp a success.
[4869.66 --> 4874.02]  May this be a seed that can grow in the hearts of both campers and parents.
[4874.02 --> 4877.68]  We pray the same as we look forward to the basic skills camp in August.
[4878.62 --> 4880.66]  Please be near the volunteers as they prepare.
[4881.26 --> 4887.14]  And may this too be an event that spreads your word and enhances your glory in our community.
[4887.14 --> 4893.20]  We give thanks for the work of World Renew and bringing clean water to communities in need.
[4893.90 --> 4899.34]  Drinkable water available at the twist of a knob is something that we take too easily for granted.
[4899.34 --> 4907.74]  And we pray that supporting a program like this can help those in need and help ourselves be good stewards of the precious gift of water.
[4907.74 --> 4913.94]  We pray for comfort and healing for all those dealing with ongoing health concerns.
[4914.46 --> 4924.86]  Whether spiritual, emotional, or physical, we pray for your loving hand to work in our loved ones' lives and help them through difficult times and dark days.
[4925.80 --> 4929.86]  And we pray especially this morning for Robin who is missing her mother.
[4930.90 --> 4935.56]  And we just pray for comfort for her as she goes through a difficult time as well.
[4935.56 --> 4945.22]  We pray for healing for little Richie Hendrickson, his parents Cody and Tara, and all those surrounding him with their love and support.
[4945.90 --> 4950.90]  It's such a difficult way to start life for Richie and also as parents for Cody and Tara.
[4951.08 --> 4955.12]  So we pray for your intervention to allow full healing for Richie.
[4956.04 --> 4958.46]  We pray for an end to the war in Ukraine.
[4959.28 --> 4962.60]  Please work in the hearts of all the leaders involved in the conflict.
[4962.60 --> 4972.80]  And please grant wisdom to find a solution that ends the terrible loss of life and wanton destruction and allows the peoples in that land to find peace.
[4974.98 --> 4979.50]  God, our Creator, yours is the morning and yours is the evening.
[4980.44 --> 4986.62]  Let Christ, the Son of Righteousness, shine forever in our hearts and draw us to the light of your glory.
[4986.62 --> 4991.32]  All this we pray ever and always in your glorious name.
[4991.90 --> 4992.14]  Amen.
[4992.14 --> 4992.24]  Amen.
[5003.04 --> 5005.30]  I invite you to stand if you are able.
[5007.04 --> 5016.06]  And as we conclude our service, right after we finish our last song, I invite you into the fellowship hall directly through the doors there for a time of fellowship and coffee.
[5016.82 --> 5018.62]  And so you are welcome to join us.
[5018.62 --> 5022.94]  Now I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5024.28 --> 5034.18]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.
[5035.14 --> 5041.34]  To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.
[5041.88 --> 5042.20]  Amen.
[5042.20 --> 5042.30]  Amen.
[5048.62 --> 5049.62]  Amen.
[5049.62 --> 5063.92]  S disappear.
[5067.86 --> 5069.66]  Amen.
[5069.66 --> 5075.60]  And unto the Lord
[5075.60 --> 5078.00]  Praise and glory
[5078.00 --> 5080.66]  Wisdom and thanks
[5080.66 --> 5084.66]  Honor and power and strength
[5084.66 --> 5090.60]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5090.60 --> 5095.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5095.74 --> 5100.90]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5100.90 --> 5102.90]  Amen
[5102.90 --> 5109.74]  And we the redeemed shall be strong
[5110.50 --> 5115.12]  In purpose and unity
[5115.12 --> 5119.74]  Declaring the land
[5120.26 --> 5122.68]  Praise and glory
[5122.68 --> 5124.74]  Wisdom and thanks
[5124.74 --> 5129.74]  Honor and power and strength
[5130.28 --> 5134.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5134.74 --> 5140.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5140.74 --> 5145.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5145.74 --> 5146.74]  Amen
[5146.74 --> 5156.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5156.74 --> 5160.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5160.74 --> 5165.74]  Be to our God forever and ever
[5165.74 --> 5166.74]  Amen
[5166.74 --> 5168.74]  Amen
[5168.74 --> 5172.74]  Amen
[5172.74 --> 5180.74]  Amen
[5180.74 --> 5181.74]  Amen
[5181.74 --> 5182.74]  Amen
[5182.74 --> 5184.74]  Amen
[5184.74 --> 5214.72]  Thank you.
