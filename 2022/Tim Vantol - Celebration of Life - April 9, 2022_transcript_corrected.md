[574.36 → 604.34] Thank you.
[604.34 → 634.32] All right.
[634.32 → 664.30] Paul writes this in 1 Thessalonians.
[664.30 → 694.28] There are a lot of things here.
[694.28 → 724.26] Thank you.
[724.26 → 754.26] Thank you.
[754.26 → 754.28] 
[784.26 → 784.32] 
[814.26 → 823.00] water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of
[823.00 → 831.40] water welling up to eternal life. And Jesus stood in a loud voice and said, let anyone who is thirsty
[831.40 → 838.70] come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as scripture has said, rivers of living water
[838.70 → 843.42] will flow from within them. Would you pray with me?
[846.26 → 855.98] Lord, we praise you that even in our sadness, you give us hope. Father, you are the maker of heaven
[855.98 → 863.82] and earth, and you formed us out of the dust of the earth. And at the right moment, you return us all
[863.82 → 869.84] to dust. You are the maker and creator of us all. Father, we praise you.
[872.00 → 878.20] Jesus Christ, you are the resurrection and the life. You tasted death for every one of us,
[878.46 → 883.86] and you conquered the grave and opened the way to eternal life. Lord Jesus, we praise you.
[886.04 → 891.52] Holy Spirit, you are the comforter of every person who experiences pain and sorrow and heartbreak.
[891.52 → 899.56] You come alongside us in our grief and embrace us with your love. Holy Spirit, we praise you.
[900.18 → 905.72] We praise you, loving God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To you be all glory and honour forever and
[905.72 → 913.56] ever. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. I want to invite us to stand, and we will sing together this song
[913.56 → 917.68] called The River. Please rise and let us sing together.
[921.52 → 923.52] To the river. Please rise and let us sing together.
[923.52 → 925.52] To the river. Please rise and let us sing together.
[925.52 → 930.52] To the river. I am going.
[930.52 → 933.52] I am going.
[933.52 → 939.52] Bringing sins I cannot bear.
[939.52 → 944.52] Come and cleanse me. Come and forgive me.
[944.52 → 951.52] Come and forgive me. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[951.52 → 955.52] To meet you there.
[955.52 → 971.52] In these waters, healing mercy flows good freedom from despair.
[971.52 → 974.52] I am going in the river.
[974.52 → 975.52] I am going.
[975.52 → 977.52] To that river.
[977.52 → 981.52] To that river.
[981.52 → 988.52] Lord, I need to meet you there.
[988.52 → 1002.92] Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1002.92 → 1017.10] Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1018.52 → 1035.70] To the river I am going, bringing sins I cannot bear.
[1035.70 → 1049.70] Come and cleanse me, come forgive me. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1049.70 → 1063.70] And in these waters, healing mercy flows with freedom from despair.
[1063.70 → 1079.70] I am going to that river. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1079.70 → 1093.70] Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1093.70 → 1108.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1108.70 → 1125.70] Come and join us in the river. Come find a life beyond compare.
[1125.70 → 1140.70] He is calling. He is waiting. Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1140.70 → 1155.70] He is calling. He is waiting. Jesus longs to meet you there.
[1155.70 → 1170.70] Precious Jesus, I am ready to surrender every care.
[1170.70 → 1186.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1186.70 → 1203.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer. Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1203.70 → 1205.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1205.70 → 1207.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1207.70 → 1209.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1209.70 → 1211.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1211.70 → 1213.70] Take my hand now, lead me closer.
[1213.70 → 1215.70] You may be seated.
[1215.70 → 1220.70] So it's good during this time to remember.
[1220.70 → 1224.70] To remember Tim and what he means to us.
[1224.70 → 1234.70] And so we're going to invite Johnny, Noreen first, to come up.
[1234.70 → 1239.70] And then Johnny, Tim's brother, to share some family memories.
[1239.70 → 1262.70] And so we're going to invite Johnny, Noreen first, to share some family memories.
[1262.70 → 1266.70] Family, friends, and fellow fishermen.
[1266.70 → 1271.70] I welcome you in joining us in celebration of a life well lived.
[1271.70 → 1281.70] Timothy Van Tull was a wonderful husband.
[1281.70 → 1284.70] Father to Lisa and Christina.
[1284.70 → 1286.70] Brother to Ralph, Johnny, Denny.
[1286.70 → 1288.70] And late brother Henry.
[1288.70 → 1291.70] Son to John and late mother Jenny.
[1291.70 → 1294.70] Grandfather to his beloved Alexander.
[1294.70 → 1299.70] Uncle to many, but especially his nephew Jeremy.
[1299.70 → 1304.70] His church family and very large extended family.
[1304.70 → 1307.70] He was an all around true family man.
[1307.70 → 1312.70] Tim was born in New Westminster on May 9th, 1962.
[1312.70 → 1319.70] Young Tim lived in Tallow, BC where along with his brothers and dad began a love of fishing and the great outdoors.
[1319.70 → 1325.70] At age 9, his family relocated to Ladder where he ended up spending the majority of his life.
[1325.70 → 1328.70] But it wasn't all smooth sailing.
[1328.70 → 1334.70] When the family arrived at their home on 60B, their neighbours were the Again family.
[1334.70 → 1340.70] Tim made fast friends with the boys, Rick and Ed, and the neighbourhood kids.
[1340.70 → 1343.70] But they also got into some shenanigans.
[1343.70 → 1346.70] Like the time of the Grand Theft Auto.
[1346.70 → 1349.70] Just a side note.
[1349.70 → 1353.70] Never leave your keys in the car when you're out.
[1353.70 → 1354.70] Sorry.
[1354.70 → 1359.70] Never leave your keys in the car when you go out when there's teens in the hood.
[1359.70 → 1371.70] The story goes that Uncle, or Tim's Uncle Bert had plans to go with Tim's mum and dad to a family function in Abbotsford, leaving his car with the keys in it.
[1371.70 → 1378.70] This is the time that Tim gained his love for driving, and he was only 14 at the time.
[1378.70 → 1388.70] I met Tim in August 1979 while walking around Ladder with my friend Karen Ball and seeing him in his hot little silver Toyota.
[1388.70 → 1390.70] Ooh la la.
[1390.70 → 1391.70] And so it began.
[1391.70 → 1398.70] June 22nd, 1985, we said our I does.
[1398.70 → 1405.70] Tim, sorry, time before that was spent with many amazing friends that we still have today.
[1405.70 → 1410.70] Fishing friends, school friends, work friends, neighbourhood friends.
[1410.70 → 1411.70] He had friends everywhere.
[1411.70 → 1413.70] I don't even know all his friends.
[1413.70 → 1417.70] The girls often tell me that complete strangers would walk up to them and say,
[1417.70 → 1418.70] I knew your dad.
[1418.70 → 1420.70] Tim loved to chat.
[1420.70 → 1423.70] Tim had an extreme love of music.
[1423.70 → 1425.70] It was more than a feeling.
[1425.70 → 1428.70] It was a beautiful day and included many concerts.
[1428.70 → 1443.70] From April Wine to Bob Seeger, Boston to the Cars, 5440 to U2 to Elton and the Eagles, Bryan Adams, Nazareth to Tom Cochran, Pink Floyd and Rush all the way to ZZ Top.
[1443.70 → 1446.70] There wasn't a rock band that Tim didn't like.
[1446.70 → 1448.70] But Tim's dirty little secret?
[1448.70 → 1450.70] He liked Nickelback.
[1450.70 → 1461.70] In 1989, we decided to start our family and on January 2nd, 1990, our little copper top, Lisa Lynn, was born.
[1461.70 → 1466.70] Followed by Tim's mini me, Christina Jennifer, on January 19, 1992.
[1466.70 → 1475.70] Tim loved his girls and when I suggested going for a boy, he said, Nope, my girls are all I need.
[1475.70 → 1478.70] So we compromised and Sedge came along.
[1478.70 → 1482.70] Tim was an animal lover, so there were many cats too.
[1482.70 → 1486.70] If you knew Tim, you knew he loved sports.
[1486.70 → 1487.70] Any kind of sport.
[1487.70 → 1489.70] Well, except basketball.
[1489.70 → 1496.70] There wasn't a Sunday without some time on the couch, watching NASCAR, golf or hockey, depending on the season.
[1496.70 → 1509.70] The feather in his cap was being at the Chicago Blackhawks vs. Vancouver Canucks game, 7, to decide who would move on to the Stanley Cup in 2011, where the Canucks would go on to win the game.
[1509.70 → 1516.70] If you've been to our home, you know we have a garden, and a big one at that.
[1516.70 → 1520.70] Tim was known for his green thumb, and he was amazing at planting.
[1520.70 → 1522.70] Weeding though, not so much.
[1522.70 → 1526.70] Somehow, he got the credit for all the great produce.
[1526.70 → 1528.70] I was the one tasked with all the weeding.
[1528.70 → 1532.70] In all seriousness, Tim loved his garden and many reaped the rewards.
[1532.70 → 1537.70] I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about Tim's career.
[1537.70 → 1544.70] He spent 34 and a half years at Overweight Food Group, more recently known as Safe on Foods.
[1544.70 → 1558.70] He was hardworking, both at home and at work, known as Tim the Tool Man, and in later years, when he moved to the bulk section, he liked to give out candy samples, and thus became known as the handy dandy candy man.
[1558.70 → 1567.70] Wait, are there... there are no Saves on Foods managers here, are there? I'm not responsible for the candy.
[1567.70 → 1574.70] He also had a side gig, pressure washing, that was the extra income we needed to put the kids through Delta Christian School.
[1574.70 → 1583.70] As a handyman, he could fix anything. Anybody got duct tape? That stuff will fix anything, like the pipes under the house.
[1583.70 → 1589.70] Anybody that knew Tim knew his favourite place was on the water with a fishing rod in hand.
[1589.70 → 1595.70] Some of his favourite places were Roche Lake, Wellington Point, basically any water in BC.
[1595.70 → 1599.70] Often people would ask, where's Tim? And my answer was fishing.
[1599.70 → 1604.70] And they'd say, where? And my answer would be, I don't know.
[1604.70 → 1614.70] He loved his annual fishing trips with Ed Lucian, Ed's friend Ron, Kai, or anybody that invited him, or he invited.
[1614.70 → 1616.70] It didn't take much to get Tim out fishing.
[1616.70 → 1622.70] Over the years, I was able to get Tim out of the boat and onto the beach.
[1622.70 → 1627.70] We spent time in Mexico, Cuba with the girls, and friends.
[1627.70 → 1629.70] He always looked forward to our winter getaway.
[1629.70 → 1637.70] Summer trips included our annual week at Roche Lake and later the Sun Peaks Retro Music Festival with the crew.
[1637.70 → 1643.70] Randy and April, Brent and Roberta, Dan and Les. It became a favourite.
[1643.70 → 1647.70] Tim was a lifelong member of the Christian Reformed Church.
[1647.70 → 1651.70] He loved his church family, many of whom are here today.
[1651.70 → 1657.70] He was a cadet leader for many years with the same group of boys where he marched to the beat of a different drum,
[1657.70 → 1660.70] not always following the program.
[1660.70 → 1663.70] That doesn't sound like Tim at all.
[1663.70 → 1673.70] And as a handyman he was, of course, and as the handyman he was, of course, he loved being part of the church maintenance committee.
[1673.70 → 1685.70] In September 2018, we were handed the devastating news of cancer.
[1685.70 → 1693.70] After our first appointment at the Surrey Cancer Agency, we knew we were in for a fight.
[1693.70 → 1700.70] After many rounds of chemo and immunotherapy treatments, it was clear that the treatment wasn't treating.
[1700.70 → 1709.70] Tim lost his battle at home with his family at his side.
[1709.70 → 1714.70] I'd like to take this opportunity to thank people that made a difference.
[1714.70 → 1721.70] His doctor, Sandy Chung, without her guidance we could never have taken care of Tim at home.
[1721.70 → 1727.70] She even gave me her personal cell and told me that I could call her at any time.
[1727.70 → 1729.70] How amazing was that?
[1729.70 → 1738.70] Tim's oncologist, Dr. Conrad OMA, who never made us feel rushed no matter how many patients were waiting.
[1738.70 → 1748.70] And the staff at the Surrey Cancer Clinic and the palliative home care staff, thank you for your compassion and care.
[1748.70 → 1751.70] We appreciate everything you did.
[1751.70 → 1760.70] And the neighbourhood husbands, Dave Wright and John McDonald, for helping me keep the home on 53rd so neat and tidy.
[1760.70 → 1771.70] And talking about our home, our Uncle Harry Vandal, who built it, continues to help support updating it and in Tim's place always takes my tech calls on this old house.
[1771.70 → 1777.70] Oh, and Mr. Meyer, Christina's Beyoncé, what would I do without your help all year round?
[1777.70 → 1783.70] They say you can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family, but in your case I choose you for both. I love you.
[1783.70 → 1793.70] Tim's work family, thank you for all the messages, flowers, notes of encouragement. I truly feel blessed and supported.
[1793.70 → 1803.70] My work family, first the boss, Dave Human, thank you for giving me the freedom to do what I needed to do to get through this difficult time.
[1803.70 → 1810.70] Your support was incredible. And to my co-workers, I always feel supported, and I really appreciate that.
[1810.70 → 1820.70] To Johnny and Moral, thank you for taking all of my crying phone calls and doing everything you possibly could for me. I am forever grateful.
[1820.70 → 1832.70] And to my sisters, Laura, Linda, Carol and Roberta, I'm so grateful for you all. How did I get so lucky? You are truly my angels on earth.
[1832.70 → 1845.70] Thank you for continuing support as I move forward without my love.
[1845.70 → 1852.70] Roberta and Carol, thank you for helping me navigate all the legalities one has to deal with after losing a loved one.
[1852.70 → 1857.70] I couldn't have managed without you. There's a saying in my family about the baby Roberta.
[1857.70 → 1862.70] Thank God they had one more.
[1862.70 → 1870.70] To Brent, for all the amazing dinners that I have enjoyed at your table, I've always felt so welcome.
[1870.70 → 1876.70] I remember when Rock was young, Timmy and I had so much fun holding hands and skimming stones.
[1876.70 → 1891.70] It seems so long ago and feels like yesterday. Life is a highway, especially when you're living the high life. You know it's more than a feeling and I hope you had the time of your life.
[1891.70 → 1900.70] Long, lifelong friend Alison Hamlin recently said to me, you and Tim were one of those rare couples out there that we're friends too.
[1900.70 → 1906.70] And boy, did we have a blast. And like a true gentleman, he knew when it was time to go.
[1906.70 → 1907.70] Thank you.
[1936.70 → 1946.70] Good afternoon, everyone. It's so wonderful to see so many of Tim's family and friends here today.
[1946.70 → 1951.70] Thank you for coming. And welcome to Tim's home church.
[1951.70 → 1959.70] My name is Johnny Van tall. I'm one of Tim's four brothers. Up here with me is my loving wife, Moral.
[1959.70 → 1966.70] On behalf of the Van tall family, thank you for coming to celebrate Tim's life.
[1966.70 → 1971.70] We thank you for your cards, flowers, words of encouragement and prayers.
[1971.70 → 1976.70] We have been surrounded by your love.
[1976.70 → 1982.70] Please join us after this service in the fellowship hall for coffee and refreshments,
[1982.70 → 1989.70] as well as a time to say hello to some old friends and a time to make some new ones.
[1989.70 → 1993.70] Tim would love that.
[1993.70 → 1999.70] There are four words that all begin with the letter F that best describes my older brother Tim.
[1999.70 → 2008.70] Family, friends, faith, and of course, fishing.
[2008.70 → 2011.70] Somebody read my speech.
[2011.70 → 2014.70] Tim loved his family.
[2014.70 → 2020.70] Our hearts continued to mourn with his wife, Noreen, his daughters, Lisa and Christina,
[2020.70 → 2023.70] and with his grandson, Alex.
[2023.70 → 2032.70] Our sympathies also go out to Dad and Wilma, to my two brothers, Ralph and Danny,
[2032.70 → 2038.70] and to our entire family and to all of Tim's friends.
[2038.70 → 2041.70] But we are also thankful.
[2041.70 → 2048.70] Thankful for our Heavenly Father, who Tim now sees face to face in Heaven.
[2048.70 → 2053.70] On the early morning of December 18, 2020, surrounded by his family,
[2053.70 → 2059.70] Tim took his last breath here on Earth and took his first breath in Paradise.
[2059.70 → 2070.70] While Tim battled his cancer for two years, Tim reminded us that it was not Tim holding on to God,
[2070.70 → 2072.70] but God holding on to him.
[2072.70 → 2079.70] As Tim passed into glory, we can only imagine the first words that he spoke upon entering Heaven.
[2079.70 → 2082.70] Where is the lake?
[2082.70 → 2085.70] Tim was a great sports fisherman.
[2085.70 → 2088.70] He haunted fish most of his life.
[2088.70 → 2092.70] Tim said that catching a fish was like catching lightning on a fishing rod.
[2092.70 → 2094.70] And he loved it.
[2094.70 → 2101.70] All of us boys were taught to fish by our Dad, who was also a great fisherman at an early age.
[2101.70 → 2111.70] See, we grew up in nature, in the town of Below, way up north, about 10 kilometres south of the metropolis of Smothers.
[2111.70 → 2117.70] It is affectionately known as God's country.
[2117.70 → 2123.70] Our humble home was just a five-minute walk to the crystal-clear, fast-flowing Below River.
[2123.70 → 2130.70] Our mom and dad made it very clear that we were not to go near that river without an adult,
[2130.70 → 2133.70] should we get swept away by the rapids.
[2133.70 → 2140.70] But, on one particular day, Tim and I wandered over to the forbidden shore.
[2140.70 → 2145.70] The water so clean, so clear, we could see the fish right below our feet.
[2145.70 → 2148.70] It was too tempting.
[2148.70 → 2151.70] We had to catch that fish.
[2151.70 → 2160.70] We found a broken stick, grabbed some discarded fishing line, secured a pointy hook, and dug up a wiggly worm.
[2160.70 → 2162.70] We were all set.
[2162.70 → 2164.70] Bam!
[2164.70 → 2168.70] Two minutes, we caught that two-pound salmon.
[2168.70 → 2171.70] We felt like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.
[2171.70 → 2173.70] We were so proud of that fish.
[2173.70 → 2175.70] We were only kids.
[2175.70 → 2179.70] And we wanted to show our parents our prize catch.
[2179.70 → 2182.70] But there was a problem.
[2182.70 → 2185.70] We were not supposed to be near that river.
[2185.70 → 2188.70] What if our folks found out we were?
[2188.70 → 2194.70] Now, what do we do with this foot-long silvery fish?
[2194.70 → 2198.70] Well, Tim had an idea.
[2198.70 → 2205.70] We snuck the fish into our home and located our oversized tabby cat, Tom.
[2205.70 → 2209.70] Our cat was fed well that day.
[2209.70 → 2215.70] He unfortunately smelled like a dead fish for a week.
[2215.70 → 2218.70] But it was kept a secret.
[2218.70 → 2220.70] Our secret.
[2220.70 → 2222.70] And it was so much fun.
[2222.70 → 2229.70] And although I never caught the fishing bug that day, my brother Tim sure did.
[2229.70 → 2236.70] Another interesting story about our childhood living in the small visit of Tulsa also involves my brother Tim.
[2236.70 → 2240.70] See, the winters were brutally cold up there, especially back in the 70s.
[2240.70 → 2243.70] Minus 30 was not uncommon.
[2243.70 → 2254.70] We were the first kids on the big yellow bus every morning, as our bus driver, George Coopmans, who lived just down the road, the snow-packed gravel road, would be the bus driver and pick us up.
[2254.70 → 2256.70] We were the first on the bus.
[2256.70 → 2264.70] And like many other cold days in Tulsa, the heating system on the bus was not able to heat up the interior of the bus.
[2264.70 → 2270.70] We took our seats on the stiff green leather seats about four seats back of the bus driver.
[2270.70 → 2277.70] But overnight, a frost had accumulated on the back bar on the seat in front of us.
[2277.70 → 2284.70] Tim, being the brightest of the Vandal boys, decided to lick the frost off the bar.
[2284.70 → 2288.70] It did not go well.
[2288.70 → 2292.70] Tim's tongue got stuck to the metal bar.
[2292.70 → 2295.70] I mean, really stuck.
[2295.70 → 2300.70] Tim yanked his head back, but it just stretched out his tongue.
[2300.70 → 2301.70] It just wouldn't budge.
[2301.70 → 2304.70] It was stuck like crazy glue.
[2304.70 → 2311.70] The steam from Tim's warm breath did not ease the sticky situation and possibly made the matters worse.
[2311.70 → 2318.70] We bumped down the frozen snowy road as Tim's teeth clanged off the green metal bar like a xylophone.
[2318.70 → 2324.70] About a mile down the road, our bus driver heard some commotion and pulled the brakes on the bus.
[2324.70 → 2335.70] Upon inspection, Mr. Coopmans grabbed a steaming thermos of scalding hot coffee and got ready to pour it on Tim's tongue that was now stuck and swollen.
[2335.70 → 2341.70] Just as the first drops of liquid java came spilling out, Tim jerked his head back.
[2341.70 → 2343.70] Success!
[2343.70 → 2348.70] Tim released most of his tongue from its icy grip.
[2348.70 → 2353.70] Tim may have voided the scalding coffee, but the damage was done.
[2353.70 → 2358.70] I can still hear Tim lisp to this day.
[2358.70 → 2364.70] It's the least one that I found in the house.
[2364.70 → 2367.70] We're friends with you.
[2367.70 → 2371.70] Many of you may know that Noreen and Tim grew an amazing vegetable garden in the backyard.
[2371.70 → 2378.70] Many of the dinners at the Mantel House included a fresh barbecued salmon that Tim had caught just recently.
[2378.70 → 2386.70] They had fresh dug-up potatoes and carrots, as well as a cool cucumber salad, straight from their backyard garden.
[2386.70 → 2390.28] How many of us are able to catch and grow our dinners?
[2392.54 → 2396.80] In 1977, when Tim was just 16 years old,
[2397.82 → 2401.82] he and a friend were in a horrific vehicle accident right here on Arthur Drive.
[2403.04 → 2407.10] It took over two hours to extract Tim from the squash pickup truck.
[2407.24 → 2414.78] And once in hospital, it was revealed that almost every bone on the right side of Tim's body was broken.
[2414.78 → 2423.54] Tim spent three and a half months recovering at VGH and had multiple surgeries to repair his broken body.
[2424.36 → 2430.24] I clearly remember my mom taking the bus every weekday while my dad was at work
[2430.24 → 2434.78] to visit her son in the hospital for three and a half months.
[2436.10 → 2438.38] Tim almost lost his right leg due to infection.
[2438.70 → 2444.06] The doctors told Tim he would never run and certainly not ice skate again.
[2444.78 → 2449.36] As his leg was being held together with titanium rods and screws.
[2450.54 → 2451.68] And possibly duct tape.
[2455.26 → 2458.62] But, Tim proved that prognosis wrong.
[2459.62 → 2462.40] Tim went on to play ball hockey with his friends for many years.
[2463.54 → 2465.40] And when the weather was cold enough in Ladder,
[2465.40 → 2470.02] Tim was one out scouting ice skating ponds around Ladder,
[2470.02 → 2473.50] calling up his friends and family for some competitive game of shinny.
[2474.38 → 2475.72] We all loved those days.
[2477.56 → 2483.50] A few months before Tim passed away, I watched him sell some of his most prized fishing possessions.
[2484.70 → 2489.34] Tim knew that he would no longer need his 12-foot aluminum fishing boat,
[2489.34 → 2494.00] its trailer, its 12-horse outboard motor,
[2494.54 → 2496.64] along with oars, anchor,
[2496.64 → 2499.32] and a few well-used crab traps.
[2500.72 → 2506.46] I will never know how Tim was able to do that with such peace and dignity.
[2506.46 → 2510.76] Tim told me that since his accident in 1977,
[2511.76 → 2515.24] that God had blessed him with an extra 43 years of life.
[2516.24 → 2520.66] Tim said he was blessed to meet and marry his wife of 35 years, Noreen.
[2521.20 → 2524.82] That he was blessed with two loving daughters, Lisa and Christina,
[2525.36 → 2528.58] and a precious grandson, Alex.
[2528.58 → 2534.72] In closing, if you desire to be close to Tim,
[2535.34 → 2538.92] you want to share a story, a laugh, a fishing story,
[2540.26 → 2543.90] well, Tim's family has donated a plaque at Wellington Point,
[2544.50 → 2545.94] one of Tim's favourite places.
[2546.80 → 2548.92] You will find the plaque under a shady tree
[2548.92 → 2553.58] on the side of the hill overlooking the mighty Fraser River.
[2554.44 → 2557.30] You can find Wellington Point on the way to West ham Island.
[2557.30 → 2561.36] This is where Tim Fight launched his boat,
[2562.26 → 2563.50] walked Christina's dog ranger,
[2564.10 → 2567.60] and thanked God for all of life's blessings.
[2569.08 → 2572.30] Tim, we all miss you.
[2573.66 → 2575.08] Thank you for your love
[2575.08 → 2578.74] and the many memories.
[2581.04 → 2582.42] Till we meet again,
[2584.04 → 2586.36] may you fish in peace.
[2587.30 → 2594.60] Now,
[2595.10 → 2598.72] we invite you to sit back and relax
[2598.72 → 2603.72] and enjoy the photo montage put together by Noreen's family
[2603.72 → 2609.06] for a life of Tim that was well lived.
[2609.06 → 2614.36] and if you feel like singing along to some of Tim's favourite rock and roll songs,
[2614.86 → 2615.66] please do so.
[2617.16 → 2618.80] Tim would love that.
[2619.80 → 2620.26] Enjoy.
[2620.26 → 2625.64] applause
[2625.64 → 2655.62] Thank you.
[2655.64 → 2685.62] Thank you.
[2685.64 → 2687.64] Thank you.
[2715.64 → 2717.64] Thank you.
[2717.64 → 2719.64] Thank you.
[2719.64 → 2721.64] Thank you.
[2721.64 → 2723.64] Thank you.
[2723.64 → 2725.64] Thank you.
[2753.64 → 2755.64] Thank you.
[2755.64 → 2757.64] Thank you.
[2757.64 → 2759.64] Thank you.
[2759.64 → 2761.64] Thank you.
[2761.64 → 2763.64] Thank you.
[2763.64 → 2765.64] Thank you.
[2765.64 → 2767.64] Thank you.
[2767.64 → 2769.64] Thank you.
[2769.64 → 2771.64] Thank you.
[2771.64 → 2778.78] While the other kids were rockin' round the clock, we were hoppin' and boppin' to the crocodile rock, well.
[2778.78 → 2784.04] Crying a rockin', because I was shoppin' when your feet just can't keep still.
[2784.88 → 2790.36] I never knew me about all the time, and I guess I never will.
[2791.48 → 2797.90] I was a mama, because I did nice, when shoes were warm, kept them tight, and
[2797.90 → 2802.16] You'd cry a rockin' on the island off the side.
[2816.16 → 2823.22] The years went by, and rocked out the dive, Susie Waddle left this for some foreign guy.
[2823.22 → 2832.10] Long nights cryin' by the record machine, dreamin' of the Chevy and my old blue jeans, but they never kill the truth we've got.
[2832.82 → 2838.58] Turnin' up to the crocodile rock, learnin' fast as the weeks went fast.
[2839.18 → 2843.00] We really thought the crocodile rock would last well.
[2843.42 → 2848.18] Rockin', rockin', stompin' shoppin' when your feet just can't keep still.
[2848.18 → 2854.78] I never knew me about all the time, and I guess I never will.
[2855.78 → 2861.82] I don't want to cross the side of the ice, but soon the war, kept them tight.
[2862.50 → 2866.34] You'd cry a rockin' on the island off the side.
[2866.34 → 2886.90] I remember when rock was young, Susie and I had so much fun.
[2886.90 → 2910.14] The love's like a road that you travel, when there's one day and the next day gone.
[2910.14 → 2914.74] Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stink, sometimes you turn your back to the wind.
[2914.88 → 2919.20] There's a world outside the darkened door, where blues won't haunt you anymore.
[2919.54 → 2924.10] With a brave, I free, and love a soul, come ride with me to the distant shore.
[2924.78 → 2928.80] You won't hesitate, break down the garden gate.
[2929.36 → 2931.68] There's not much time left today.
[2931.68 → 2939.96] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[2942.54 → 2949.28] If you're going my way, I won't drive it all night long.
[2951.88 → 2956.62] Through all these cities and all these towns, it's in my blood, and it's all around.
[2956.84 → 2959.12] I love you now like I loved you then.
[2959.12 → 2961.36] This is the road and these are the hills.
[2961.56 → 2966.14] From Mozambique to those Memphis nights, the Caber Pass to Vancouver's lights.
[2966.42 → 2968.46] Knock me down, I'm back up again.
[2968.56 → 2970.80] You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man.
[2971.42 → 2973.14] It's not alone, I can't hold.
[2973.42 → 2975.44] A road to rock, this I know.
[2975.78 → 2977.82] I'll be there when the light comes in.
[2977.88 → 2979.48] Just tell them we're a survivor.
[2980.32 → 2986.30] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[2989.12 → 2995.88] If you're going my way, I won't drive it all night long.
[2998.56 → 3005.24] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[3005.24 → 3007.84] Give me a little, give me a little, yeah.
[3007.84 → 3014.48] You're going my way, I want to drive it all night long.
[3014.48 → 3023.48] There was a distance between you and me.
[3027.92 → 3034.26] Misunderstanding once, but now we're looking at the eye.
[3034.26 → 3059.48] There ain't no love that I can't hold.
[3059.56 → 3061.58] A road to rock, this I know.
[3061.58 → 3064.02] I'll be there when the light comes in.
[3064.08 → 3065.66] Just tell them we're a survivor.
[3068.54 → 3075.06] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[3075.84 → 3077.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3077.64 → 3084.32] If you're going my way, I don't want to drive it all night long.
[3085.02 → 3085.40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3085.40 → 3087.00] Give me, give me, give me, give me, yeah.
[3087.00 → 3093.66] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[3095.96 → 3102.90] If you're going my way, I won't drive it all night long.
[3104.38 → 3105.54] Yeah, yeah.
[3105.92 → 3112.28] Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long.
[3112.28 → 3113.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3113.28 → 3114.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3114.28 → 3121.54] If you're going my way, I won't drive it all night long.
[3121.54 → 3124.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3124.24 → 3128.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3128.28 → 3150.82] Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.
[3150.82 → 3155.82] Time grabs you by the rest, directs you where to go.
[3156.60 → 3161.04] So make the best of this task and don't ask why.
[3161.64 → 3165.92] It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.
[3166.26 → 3170.76] It's something unpredictable, and in the end is right.
[3171.20 → 3174.90] I hope you had the time of your life.
[3174.90 → 3188.56] So take the photographs and still frames in your mind.
[3189.54 → 3193.50] Hanging on a shelf in good health and good time.
[3194.46 → 3198.70] Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial.
[3199.48 → 3203.66] For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.
[3203.66 → 3208.56] It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right.
[3208.80 → 3212.70] I hope you had the time of your life.
[3212.70 → 3219.70] You know, you can also look than take the bath, or you will.
[3221.64 → 3236.40] You can easily curse your eyes out of your life.
[3236.40 → 3238.72] It's something van Hunan biography.
[3238.72 → 3244.06] It's something unpredictable
[3244.06 → 3246.78] But in the end it's right
[3246.78 → 3250.94] I hope you had the time of your life
[3250.94 → 3261.86] It's something unpredictable
[3261.86 → 3264.62] But in the end it's right
[3264.62 → 3269.00] I hope you had the time of your life
[3269.00 → 3284.94] I hope you had the time of your life
[3284.94 → 3294.98] That was a good one.
[3296.66 → 3301.56] Thank you, Noreen and Johnny, for sharing those memories and the amazing slideshow.
[3301.90 → 3307.92] Let's all stand now, and we're going to sing together, God is with you, till we meet again.
[3308.20 → 3308.68] Let's sing.
[3314.94 → 3316.94] Amen.
[3344.94 → 3346.94] Amen.
[3374.94 → 3382.94] Amen.
[3382.94 → 3383.94] Amen.
[3412.94 → 3413.94] Amen.
[3442.94 → 3443.94] Amen.
[3472.94 → 3473.94] Amen.
[3473.94 → 3474.94] Amen.
[3474.94 → 3475.94] Amen.
[3475.94 → 3476.94] Amen.
[3476.94 → 3477.94] Amen.
[3477.94 → 3478.94] Amen.
[3478.94 → 3481.94] I think someone took my notes, but that's okay.
[3481.94 → 3482.94] I don't need them.
[3482.94 → 3486.94] I want to introduce now Ernst de Fries.
[3486.94 → 3492.94] Ernst was a, well, he now lives in Pinocchio, Alberta, but he came down.
[3492.94 → 3496.94] And he is an elder at this church, a long-time member, and a good friend of Tim.
[3496.94 → 3499.94] So he will share God's word with us.
[3499.94 → 3506.94] Good afternoon.
[3506.94 → 3513.94] I spent a few days here in Latin, and I'm thinking I'm coming back again, this beautiful lush
[3513.94 → 3518.94] weather instead of Pinocchio, but anyway, that's a long story.
[3518.94 → 3524.94] My family and I, we came in 1986 to this church with one son.
[3524.94 → 3530.94] And we right away found out that there were a lot of Ven toles in this family, in this church
[3530.94 → 3531.94] family.
[3531.94 → 3537.94] And then I also found out that this particular family here always gone fishing.
[3537.94 → 3543.94] So I didn't really get to know this Ven toles family that well because they were always
[3543.94 → 3544.94] gone fishing.
[3544.94 → 3545.94] Seriously.
[3545.94 → 3553.94] However, when I thought about this, it's not totally true because my wife and I were blessed
[3553.94 → 3554.94] for four sons and one daughter.
[3554.94 → 3560.94] And as it already was said, that Tim was for many years a cadet counsellor.
[3560.94 → 3565.94] And when I talked to one of our sons, Matthias, he lives in Edmonton, I told him that I was
[3565.94 → 3567.94] going to be involved in this service.
[3567.94 → 3569.94] He said, tell him about that fishing story.
[3569.94 → 3570.94] He said.
[3570.94 → 3571.94] I said, which one?
[3571.94 → 3581.94] Well, they went fishing with, I think, Tim quite a few times and they caught the sturgeon.
[3581.94 → 3582.94] That's still their big fishing story.
[3582.94 → 3584.94] They still talk about that.
[3584.94 → 3586.94] And they loved Tim as a counsellor.
[3586.94 → 3590.94] I'm sure they love the other ones too, but they loved Tim as a counsellor.
[3590.94 → 3592.94] So that was absolutely wonderful.
[3592.94 → 3599.94] So Tim was still, when I think of it now, quite often mentioned in our family conversations.
[3599.94 → 3605.94] Now, this changed in the sense of getting Tim to know better when I was an elder here.
[3605.94 → 3612.94] And one day, Lisa contacted the church and because Lisa wanted to profess her faith in
[3612.94 → 3619.94] Jesus Christ, and she wanted to have Alexander, not Alex, Alexander to be baptized.
[3619.94 → 3626.94] And so another elder, Rita van Doreen, myself, we decided that we would have, need some instructions
[3626.94 → 3629.94] and some teachings to all this, to have this happen.
[3629.94 → 3633.94] We would conduct this at Tim and Noreen's house.
[3633.94 → 3641.94] And so that was also the time that Tim, of course, received the devastating news that he was
[3641.94 → 3648.94] incredibly ill and that he could not, you know, he would eventually would die.
[3648.94 → 3661.94] And so Tim and I in the house, besides the teaching of baptism and catechism, what we call, also at home and in my office,
[3661.94 → 3666.94] I had quite a few conversations with Tim when everything changed.
[3666.94 → 3672.94] And I really got to know Tim much better, especially on a spiritual level.
[3672.94 → 3686.94] So Tim and I had quite a few talks about life and about death, about his faith and assurance and hope in Jesus Christ.
[3686.94 → 3689.94] Wonderful conversations we had.
[3689.94 → 3691.94] And Tim was so honest.
[3691.94 → 3694.94] And actually he didn't even show that many emotions.
[3694.94 → 3695.94] We didn't, we never cried.
[3695.94 → 3697.94] We just, you know, we talked about it.
[3697.94 → 3705.94] And how thankful, and we've heard it already before here, how thankful he was for his family, friends, and all the good years.
[3705.94 → 3707.94] We've heard the stories, and we've seen the pictures.
[3707.94 → 3708.94] God had given him.
[3708.94 → 3713.94] Tim was really, in all these conversations, at peace with God.
[3713.94 → 3722.94] Now this afternoon, and I'm becoming very repetitious here this afternoon, because I want to take you this afternoon to a lake.
[3722.94 → 3731.94] Do you know that, of all the nations in this world, that Canada has the most lakes?
[3731.94 → 3732.94] I Googled it.
[3732.94 → 3743.94] More than 31,000 lakes in all of Canada, and you know, more than 20,000 in BC alone.
[3743.94 → 3744.94] That's a lot of water.
[3744.94 → 3746.94] That's a lot of fish.
[3746.94 → 3753.94] And so I can see that Tim, you know, he has only seen a fraction of these 20,000 lakes.
[3753.94 → 3757.94] But this afternoon I want to take you to a specific lake, and I guess you know where I'm going.
[3757.94 → 3761.94] I want to go to a lake, and that is of course in the northern part of Israel.
[3761.94 → 3767.94] And it's called the Sea of Galilee, or Galilee, or the Sea of Tiberias.
[3767.94 → 3773.94] Now, and our story then, from the scriptures, happens in that northern part.
[3773.94 → 3780.94] And guess how many lakes are there in Israel?
[3780.94 → 3790.94] 134 square kilometres, one lake in that small nation of Israel, compared with 31,000 in Canada.
[3790.94 → 3809.94] But I can tell you, and this is my interpretation, that I think more sermons, and more writings, and more books, and more news, even as of today, has been said over the last 2,000 years, about that particular lake, the Sea of Galilee, than all these lakes in the world, in fact.
[3809.94 → 3812.94] You know, it's always about the matter, you know, it's always about the Sea of Galilee.
[3812.94 → 3821.94] And the reason is, because once upon a time, 2,000 years ago, there was this man who walked upon the water.
[3821.94 → 3824.94] How spectacular that was.
[3824.94 → 3831.94] Who travelled by boat on that lake, crossing the lake, by the way, fishing boat.
[3831.94 → 3832.94] Always a fishing boat.
[3832.94 → 3834.94] Always a fishing boat.
[3834.94 → 3837.94] And he called there his 12 disciples.
[3837.94 → 3845.94] And this is where he taught the people, lots of crowds, about the kingdom of God.
[3845.94 → 3852.94] And so this afternoon, I want to share with you one short story, what happened on that lake.
[3852.94 → 3857.94] And it's found in the Gospel of Matthew, and it's found in chapter 8.
[3857.94 → 3859.94] And I'm going to go verse by verse.
[3859.94 → 3860.94] It's very short, don't worry.
[3860.94 → 3862.94] I'm going to go verse by verse.
[3862.94 → 3863.94] Simple as that.
[3863.94 → 3867.94] Jesus, it says, got into the boat, fishing boat.
[3867.94 → 3873.94] And then we read, and his disciples followed him.
[3873.94 → 3882.94] A disciple is basically somebody who is dedicated to following a person, and in this case, following disciples, tall disciples, and disciples.
[3882.94 → 3884.94] Because of following Jesus.
[3884.94 → 3891.94] Tim, too, was a dedicated, you may think he was dedicated to a lot of rock music.
[3891.94 → 3892.94] That's probably true.
[3892.94 → 3895.94] He was dedicated to following Jesus.
[3895.94 → 3898.94] I know it because in our conversations, amazing.
[3898.94 → 3906.94] And if I kind of look at this picture, and Tim would have been there, Tim would have also jumped in that boat.
[3906.94 → 3914.94] Because, you know, of those 12 disciples, there were at least, for sure, seven professional, Tim was a recreational fisherman.
[3914.94 → 3917.94] These were seven professional fishermen.
[3917.94 → 3918.94] Jesus called, amazing.
[3918.94 → 3919.94] Man of the sea.
[3919.94 → 3921.94] Hardworking man.
[3921.94 → 3924.94] Sometimes fish, a lot of times no fish.
[3924.94 → 3927.94] And so these men were just like Tim.
[3927.94 → 3932.94] And then it says in our story, and this is what happens in life.
[3932.94 → 3936.94] But, there's always that but.
[3936.94 → 3944.94] A sudden, suddenly a furious storm came upon the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat.
[3944.94 → 3946.94] A mega storm.
[3946.94 → 3949.94] If you look at the original language, which is Greek, you find the word mega.
[3949.94 → 3951.94] A huge, huge storm.
[3951.94 → 3961.94] A storm, most likely these experienced fishermen, like Peter and John, had never experienced before in their life.
[3961.94 → 3966.94] Now, in my conversations, Tim was very honest.
[3966.94 → 3971.94] And Tim shared with me that he shared storms in his life.
[3971.94 → 3973.94] Mega storms.
[3973.94 → 3978.94] His sharing reminded me of two beautiful hymns.
[3978.94 → 3979.94] I love myself.
[3979.94 → 3980.94] And I quote one here.
[3980.94 → 3987.94] And by the way, these two beautiful hymns were written by African-American pastors, who themselves went through a lot of storms.
[3987.94 → 3989.94] And the one is, maybe you know this one.
[3989.94 → 3993.94] Will your anchor hold in the storm of life.
[3993.94 → 3997.94] When the clouds unfold their wings of strife.
[3997.94 → 4002.94] When the strong tides lift and the cables strain.
[4002.94 → 4007.94] Will your anchor drift or firm remain.
[4007.94 → 4010.94] And the other one is another familiar one.
[4010.94 → 4013.94] When the storms of life are raging.
[4013.94 → 4015.94] Stand by me.
[4015.94 → 4019.94] And when the world is tossing me like a ship upon the sea.
[4019.94 → 4022.94] Thou who rules wind and water.
[4022.94 → 4024.94] Stand by me.
[4024.94 → 4033.94] The Bible is very honest about people who have gone and experienced the storms of life.
[4033.94 → 4040.94] And when I think, for example, of the psalms where I read that the psalmist is literally drowning in tears, it says.
[4040.94 → 4043.94] Because, as he says, he's overwhelmed.
[4043.94 → 4045.94] And he is anxious.
[4045.94 → 4046.94] And he's depressed.
[4046.94 → 4048.94] And he's lonely.
[4048.94 → 4050.94] All these things happening.
[4050.94 → 4052.94] Probably also in your life.
[4052.94 → 4053.94] Like a ship.
[4053.94 → 4055.94] I want to go back to that mega storm.
[4055.94 → 4059.94] On the sea of Galilee.
[4059.94 → 4062.94] It is in the midst of the storm.
[4062.94 → 4066.94] Amazingly, Jesus, in that boat, is sleeping.
[4066.94 → 4067.94] How is that possible?
[4067.94 → 4069.78] is that possible? I guess it is possible
[4069.78 → 4071.90] when you're that exhausted from hard work
[4071.90 → 4073.80] and speaking, you are exhausted
[4073.80 → 4074.70] and you sleep.
[4076.06 → 4077.96] His disciples went, as it said, and woke
[4077.96 → 4080.08] him, saying, Lord, save
[4080.08 → 4081.84] us. We are going
[4081.84 → 4082.48] to drown.
[4085.16 → 4086.16] Mega fear
[4086.16 → 4088.04] in a mega storm.
[4089.86 → 4090.16] Jesus
[4090.16 → 4092.18] got up, and then his answer
[4092.18 → 4093.64] is rather shocking.
[4094.36 → 4095.88] In the midst of this raging
[4095.88 → 4098.00] storm, Jesus addresses
[4098.00 → 4099.24] his disciples, and he says,
[4099.78 → 4101.64] O ye of little faith,
[4102.12 → 4103.56] why are you so
[4103.56 → 4104.60] afraid?
[4106.02 → 4107.68] And here's another interesting word about
[4107.68 → 4109.70] afraid. It talks about
[4109.70 → 4111.94] phobia, extreme fear,
[4112.36 → 4113.44] the fear of drowning.
[4115.24 → 4115.78] But what Jesus
[4115.78 → 4117.84] mentions here, and there's a lot to say about it, we've got to
[4117.84 → 4119.84] keep it short, is that he says that
[4119.84 → 4122.12] even in the biggest storms of your life,
[4123.04 → 4124.00] trust, you can
[4124.00 → 4125.84] trust, you can trust in me because
[4125.84 → 4128.14] I'm staying with you, I am always
[4128.14 → 4129.88] with you, I'll never leave you,
[4130.32 → 4131.38] I'll never forsake you.
[4132.72 → 4133.76] And so then he got up
[4133.76 → 4135.78] and he rebuked the winds
[4135.78 → 4137.94] and the waves, and the sea
[4137.94 → 4139.32] became completely calm.
[4139.96 → 4142.04] That word rebuke is also a strong word
[4142.04 → 4143.26] and I used it once here,
[4143.78 → 4145.56] standing here, behind the pulpit,
[4146.48 → 4147.90] and basically what it means,
[4147.98 → 4149.76] and this is what the commentaries
[4149.76 → 4151.66] tell me, that word is so strong, it basically
[4151.66 → 4153.62] means wind and waves
[4153.62 → 4154.50] shut up.
[4155.92 → 4157.70] And then that same afternoon I got a call
[4157.70 → 4158.24] from a member
[4158.24 → 4160.98] and he said,
[4161.10 → 4162.70] you should not have used that word
[4162.70 → 4165.54] because that's the word we do not teach our
[4165.54 → 4165.96] grandchildren.
[4167.72 → 4168.96] I never forget that.
[4168.96 → 4171.32] But that's the strong word
[4171.32 → 4172.12] Jesus used.
[4174.00 → 4175.18] Wind and waves
[4175.18 → 4176.10] be quiet.
[4176.80 → 4177.62] I'll use the other word.
[4179.50 → 4180.28] And so
[4180.28 → 4181.46] the winds
[4181.46 → 4182.54] and the waves
[4182.54 → 4184.84] obey Jesus, and it is suddenly
[4184.84 → 4185.22] calm.
[4185.30 → 4186.38] Now you may think, big deal.
[4187.14 → 4188.98] Because now the disciples are saying
[4188.98 → 4189.66] in great
[4189.66 → 4191.26] amazement,
[4191.44 → 4193.32] and I think if Tim had been there
[4193.32 → 4194.50] he would have said the same thing,
[4195.30 → 4196.68] who is this man?
[4197.02 → 4197.88] Even the wind
[4197.88 → 4198.68] and the waves
[4198.68 → 4199.24] obey him.
[4199.80 → 4201.20] Now these were experienced fishermen
[4201.20 → 4202.16] and I'm sure that Tim
[4202.16 → 4203.02] has been in a boat
[4203.02 → 4203.74] and there were waves
[4203.74 → 4205.48] and then suddenly the wind stops
[4205.48 → 4208.10] and then, you know,
[4208.46 → 4210.08] it's nice and quiet again.
[4210.32 → 4211.22] But there's a difference here
[4211.22 → 4212.04] because again,
[4212.70 → 4213.86] what happened here was
[4213.86 → 4214.88] these big waves,
[4215.00 → 4215.44] it stopped
[4215.44 → 4217.08] and in an instant moment,
[4217.32 → 4218.46] and these fishermen
[4218.46 → 4219.56] had never seen this before,
[4219.66 → 4220.66] and I'm sure Tim
[4220.66 → 4221.66] has never seen this before
[4221.66 → 4222.48] while he was fishing,
[4222.48 → 4225.20] there was an instant silence
[4225.20 → 4226.52] and there were no waves,
[4226.60 → 4228.04] there was not a ripple anymore.
[4228.58 → 4229.40] And that's why they
[4229.40 → 4230.78] in great fear in a sense
[4230.78 → 4231.58] in another gospel
[4231.58 → 4231.98] say,
[4232.36 → 4233.62] who is this man
[4233.62 → 4235.12] that even the wind
[4235.12 → 4236.48] and the waves
[4236.48 → 4237.32] obey him?
[4238.78 → 4240.10] Let me close with this.
[4241.34 → 4242.52] You are right now
[4242.52 → 4243.72] in this church building.
[4244.28 → 4245.68] We are a Christian church
[4245.68 → 4248.38] and this is the season of Lent.
[4248.98 → 4249.68] Next Friday
[4249.68 → 4251.54] is what we call Good Friday.
[4251.54 → 4253.38] it's not just a day off,
[4253.50 → 4255.68] it's probably the most important day
[4255.68 → 4257.24] on the Christian calendar.
[4258.32 → 4259.34] Look at the cross.
[4260.20 → 4261.00] That's why the one
[4261.00 → 4263.30] who controlled the wind
[4263.30 → 4264.04] and the waves,
[4264.94 → 4266.34] he suffered on that cross,
[4266.74 → 4267.98] he died on that horrific
[4267.98 → 4269.32] instrument of death,
[4269.74 → 4270.94] and after three days,
[4271.82 → 4274.00] he rose again to life.
[4274.82 → 4276.20] Basically, we have one message,
[4276.58 → 4277.46] the Lamb of God
[4277.46 → 4278.50] that took away
[4278.50 → 4279.78] the sins of the world.
[4280.28 → 4280.84] In other words,
[4280.90 → 4282.16] whoever believes in him
[4282.16 → 4283.36] shall not perish,
[4283.70 → 4284.88] but have eternal life.
[4285.88 → 4286.82] And you know what?
[4287.72 → 4288.34] Dear friends,
[4288.86 → 4290.10] that was the testimony
[4290.10 → 4291.50] I heard also
[4291.50 → 4292.52] from Tim.
[4293.08 → 4293.56] Amazing.
[4294.40 → 4295.16] I'd like to end
[4295.16 → 4296.40] with one more verse
[4296.40 → 4297.86] of this beautiful hymn,
[4298.76 → 4299.56] Will Your Anchor Hold
[4299.56 → 4300.52] in a Storm of Life?
[4300.52 → 4304.70] And this is what it says,
[4304.94 → 4305.96] We have an anchor
[4305.96 → 4307.58] that keeps the soul
[4307.58 → 4309.54] steadfast and sure
[4309.54 → 4311.64] while the billows roll.
[4312.68 → 4313.78] Fasten to the rock
[4313.78 → 4315.82] which cannot move,
[4315.90 → 4317.08] and that rock is Jesus Christ,
[4317.78 → 4318.68] grounded firm
[4318.68 → 4319.74] and deep
[4319.74 → 4321.40] in the Saviour's love.
[4321.40 → 4323.36] with Noreen
[4323.36 → 4323.86] and Lisa
[4323.86 → 4325.22] and the rest of the family.
[4328.78 → 4329.32] You know,
[4329.52 → 4331.30] this morning
[4331.30 → 4332.14] I talked to Noreen
[4332.14 → 4332.56] and Noreen
[4332.56 → 4333.40] is always asking,
[4333.98 → 4334.86] I have to tell you this,
[4335.72 → 4337.14] about my grandchildren
[4337.14 → 4338.38] and especially
[4338.38 → 4339.32] our daughter Miriam
[4339.32 → 4340.50] who's always a good friend
[4340.50 → 4342.34] with Noreen.
[4342.64 → 4344.22] And Noreen said,
[4344.32 → 4344.50] You know,
[4344.62 → 4345.60] how are the grandkids doing?
[4345.78 → 4348.12] And how is your youngest one doing?
[4348.24 → 4348.80] And honestly,
[4348.80 → 4351.04] I could not come up
[4351.04 → 4351.56] with a name.
[4354.46 → 4355.68] I felt so ashamed.
[4355.94 → 4356.70] So what I did,
[4356.78 → 4357.36] what I did,
[4357.42 → 4358.64] I did call my sister-in-law
[4358.64 → 4359.10] in Burnaby.
[4359.72 → 4360.00] I said,
[4360.06 → 4361.80] What is the name of...
[4361.80 → 4364.08] It's horrible.
[4364.60 → 4365.72] Don't ever tell Winnie that.
[4367.08 → 4368.28] But it was an honour
[4368.28 → 4369.24] for me to be here
[4369.24 → 4370.96] and again,
[4371.08 → 4371.82] great memories
[4371.82 → 4373.96] and may the Lord bless you
[4373.96 → 4375.18] as you go on.
[4375.34 → 4377.30] And I hope that in May
[4377.30 → 4378.08] we come back again
[4378.08 → 4378.54] with Winnie
[4378.54 → 4380.04] and hope to fish you
[4380.04 → 4380.56] as a family.
[4381.44 → 4381.70] Amen.
[4391.88 → 4392.54] Let's stand
[4392.54 → 4392.94] and let's sing
[4392.94 → 4393.72] our final song,
[4394.58 → 4395.24] Amazing Grace.
