[713.34 --> 715.66]  Hello.
[716.12 --> 717.98]  a
[717.98 --> 720.12]  han
[720.12 --> 722.10]  sagen
[722.10 --> 723.60]  quién
[723.60 --> 738.56]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him.
[738.56 --> 750.56]  Behold our God seated on His throne, come let us adore Him.
[750.56 --> 765.56]  Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him.
[768.56 --> 773.56]  In the Heidelberg Catechism, Lord's Day 10, it says,
[773.56 --> 777.56]  What do you understand by the providence of God?
[777.56 --> 788.56]  Providence is the almighty and ever-present power of God, by which He upholds, as with His hand, heaven and earth and all creatures.
[788.56 --> 809.56]  And so rules them that leaf and blade, rain and drought, fruitful and lean years, food and drink, health and sickness, prosperity and poverty, all things, in fact, come to us not by chance, but from His Fatherly hand.
[809.56 --> 814.56]  How does the knowledge of God's creation and providence help us?
[814.56 --> 827.56]  We can be patient when things go against us, thankful when things go well, and for the future, we can have good confidence in our faithful God and Father that nothing will separate us from His love.
[827.56 --> 835.56]  All creatures are so completely in His hand that without His will, they can neither move nor be moved.
[835.56 --> 840.56]  Of this we sing in This is my Father's world.
[840.56 --> 859.56]  This is my Father's world.
[859.56 --> 866.56]  Son of the Son of the Son
[866.56 --> 885.96]  The Last Ever
[885.96 --> 897.88]  Of rocks and trees, of stars and seas, is there a wondrous heart?
[899.04 --> 909.80]  This is my Father's world, the birds in their most ways.
[909.80 --> 920.78]  The morning light, the lily white, declares their Baker's praise.
[921.64 --> 931.66]  This is my Father's world, He shines in all that's fair.
[931.66 --> 942.20]  In the rustling grass, I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere.
[945.40 --> 955.66]  This is my Father's world, oh let me not forget.
[955.66 --> 967.44]  And though the Rome seems not so strong, God is the ruler yet.
[968.18 --> 978.56]  This is my Father's world, why should my heart be sad?
[978.56 --> 989.56]  The Lord is King, let the heavens ring, God brings, let the earth be glad.
[989.56 --> 996.56]  The Lord is King, let the earth be glad.
[996.56 --> 1001.56]  The Lord is King, let the earth be glad.
[1001.56 --> 1008.20]  Okay, if you're age three through grade seven, you now have the opportunity, if you wish to take it, to go to Kids Life.
[1008.20 --> 1025.66]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1025.66 --> 1042.50]  Eternal God, in whom we live and move and have our being, whose face is hidden from us by our sins, and whose mercy we forget in the blindness of our hearts,
[1043.44 --> 1049.00]  cleanse us from all our offenses, and deliver us from proud thoughts and vain desires,
[1049.00 --> 1061.12]  that with reverent and humble hearts we may draw near to you, confessing our faults, confiding in your grace, and finding in you our refuge and strength.
[1061.66 --> 1063.88]  Through Jesus Christ, your Son, Amen.
[1063.88 --> 1074.64]  And just as confession acknowledges both personal and corporate sin, we also, so also the assurance of pardon,
[1075.26 --> 1081.74]  declares a sure promise that God's grace in Christ redeems not only individuals, but also the whole creation.
[1082.78 --> 1089.14]  And this truth is stated, I think, quite clearly in Heidelberg Catechism, question and answer 59 and 60.
[1089.14 --> 1097.56]  By true faith in Jesus Christ, I am right with God and heir to life everlasting.
[1098.36 --> 1106.88]  Even though my conscience accuses me of having grievously sinned against all God's commandments and of never having kept any of them,
[1107.54 --> 1115.02]  and even though I am still inclined toward all evil, nevertheless, without my deserving it at all,
[1115.02 --> 1124.82]  out of sheer grace, God grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ,
[1125.60 --> 1133.74]  as if I had never sinned, nor been a sinner, as if I had been as perfectly obedient as Christ was obedient for me.
[1134.88 --> 1139.74]  All I need to do is to accept this gift of God with a believing heart.
[1139.74 --> 1144.52]  That is truly marvelous grace, and let's sing that together.
[1144.52 --> 1145.52]  Amen.
[1145.52 --> 1146.52]  Amen.
[1174.52 --> 1197.26]  We are none.
[1197.26 --> 1204.00]  There where the blood of the Lamb was spilled.
[1204.00 --> 1211.18]  Grace, grace, God's grace.
[1211.66 --> 1216.78]  Grace that no part of the plans within.
[1218.54 --> 1225.18]  Grace, grace, God's grace.
[1225.18 --> 1232.68]  Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1234.48 --> 1241.30]  Dark is the stain that we cannot hide.
[1241.80 --> 1247.10]  What cannot fail to wash it away?
[1247.90 --> 1255.14]  Look, there is flowing the crimson tide.
[1255.18 --> 1261.68]  Light is the best of the smoke you may be today.
[1261.68 --> 1269.68]  Grace, grace, God's grace.
[1270.18 --> 1275.68]  Grace that no part of the plans within.
[1277.38 --> 1284.18]  Grace, grace, God's grace.
[1284.18 --> 1290.68]  Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1290.68 --> 1293.42]  Grace that no part of the plan.
[1293.42 --> 1297.68]  Grace that is greater than all our sin.
[1297.68 --> 1327.66]  . . .
[1327.68 --> 1357.66]  . . .
[1357.68 --> 1359.68]  . . .

[1381.68 --> 1389.68]  . .
[1389.68 --> 1391.68]  Okay.
[1419.68 --> 1422.40]  Amen.
[1434.88 --> 1438.14]  And let's read our Heidelberg Catechism, question and answer.
[1438.32 --> 1439.92]  Today is the day of Heidelberg Catechism.
[1441.06 --> 1445.24]  And following along with the Lord's Prayer, we'll read question 124.
[1445.82 --> 1448.36]  What does the third request mean?
[1450.30 --> 1465.24]  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven means help us and all people to reject our own wills and to obey your will without any backtalk.
[1465.86 --> 1468.14]  Your will alone is good.
[1468.14 --> 1480.92]  Help us, one and all, to carry out the work we are called to as willingly and faithfully as the angels in heaven.
[1480.92 --> 1482.70]  Would you pray with me?
[1484.44 --> 1490.28]  Heavenly Father, we ask you, or we thank you, for this time of worship.
[1490.28 --> 1503.42]  This first day of the week, the day set apart to celebrate the resurrection of Christ, the life that we now have received by your marvelous grace.
[1503.42 --> 1509.68]  And we ask now, Lord, that we would have a tremendous encounter with you.
[1510.54 --> 1519.38]  We ask, Lord, that you would make it clear to us of your presence, that you are with us, that we worship you with the angels of heaven.
[1519.38 --> 1528.78]  And we ask that you would give us eyes to see, ears to hear, minds to understand, and hearts to believe your word today.
[1529.28 --> 1531.42]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1531.42 --> 1531.52]  Amen.
[1533.06 --> 1536.48]  So, friends, we are in the church season of Epiphany.
[1537.26 --> 1544.90]  And this is the season when the church around the world through the ages looks to the life of Jesus Christ.
[1545.46 --> 1551.48]  He has come to us, and he lived on this earth as a man, both fully God and fully human.
[1552.10 --> 1557.54]  And he taught, he did miracles, he preached the kingdom of God.
[1557.54 --> 1567.26]  And so, in this time, we are, as a church, turning to look at one of Jesus' core teachings on prayer, which is the Lord's Prayer.
[1567.86 --> 1574.20]  And we've been going through the Lord's Prayer in somewhat of some depth, looking at each petition of the Lord's Prayer.
[1575.24 --> 1579.62]  And today we're going to dig in deeply on the third petition,
[1580.36 --> 1583.72]  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[1583.72 --> 1587.18]  And this is an extension of what we looked at last week, which was,
[1587.76 --> 1589.38]  Your kingdom come.
[1590.08 --> 1593.98]  So, it's helpful to look at them separately, but they kind of go together in a sense.
[1594.10 --> 1597.88]  Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[1598.88 --> 1601.88]  And probably to start, it's worth reflecting that this prayer,
[1602.36 --> 1604.10]  Your kingdom come, your will be done,
[1605.08 --> 1608.00]  has been prayed for some 2,000 years
[1608.00 --> 1611.08]  by some with great tenacity.
[1611.08 --> 1614.10]  Some people have
[1614.10 --> 1616.22]  soaked the world
[1616.22 --> 1618.02]  in this prayer.
[1618.60 --> 1620.82]  Father, Your will be done.
[1621.64 --> 1622.92]  One famous story
[1622.92 --> 1624.96]  of this prayer being prayed faithfully
[1624.96 --> 1627.04]  is John Knox, the great
[1627.04 --> 1628.30]  Scottish reformer.
[1629.40 --> 1631.36]  And John Knox, he lived in the 1500s,
[1631.58 --> 1632.92]  and the Lord, through
[1632.92 --> 1635.12]  his ministry, ignited a great
[1635.12 --> 1637.08]  reformation in Scotland.
[1637.80 --> 1639.10]  And he was known
[1639.10 --> 1641.18]  known as a man of prayer.
[1641.76 --> 1643.34]  So, one night, his wife
[1643.34 --> 1644.98]  woke up in the middle of the night
[1644.98 --> 1646.28]  and found that her husband
[1646.28 --> 1647.38]  wasn't in bed.
[1647.46 --> 1648.96]  So, she got up and she went looking
[1648.96 --> 1649.74]  for her husband.
[1650.44 --> 1651.86]  She found him kneeling
[1651.86 --> 1654.64]  in his living room
[1654.64 --> 1655.86]  on the floor,
[1656.96 --> 1657.46]  praying
[1657.46 --> 1658.28]  fervently,
[1659.12 --> 1659.64]  Father,
[1660.00 --> 1661.14]  give me Scotland.
[1661.80 --> 1663.64]  Father, give me Scotland.
[1663.64 --> 1665.70]  And the Lord answered
[1665.70 --> 1666.12]  his prayer.
[1666.22 --> 1666.84]  The Lord did.
[1667.14 --> 1668.00]  One of the greatest
[1668.00 --> 1669.40]  reformations and revivals
[1669.40 --> 1670.78]  of the last 2,000 years
[1670.78 --> 1672.02]  came through God
[1672.02 --> 1672.78]  answering
[1672.78 --> 1673.72]  that
[1673.72 --> 1674.40]  prayer.
[1675.50 --> 1676.34]  And a revival
[1676.34 --> 1677.46]  is when the Spirit
[1677.46 --> 1678.74]  comes in great power
[1678.74 --> 1680.02]  on a nation,
[1680.16 --> 1680.82]  on a community,
[1680.94 --> 1681.86]  or on a church,
[1682.26 --> 1682.76]  and the Spirit
[1682.76 --> 1683.92]  comes in great power,
[1684.44 --> 1685.64]  and many people
[1685.64 --> 1687.00]  come to Christ.
[1687.44 --> 1688.88]  Many people who did not
[1688.88 --> 1689.76]  believe in Christ
[1689.76 --> 1690.88]  suddenly by the Spirit,
[1691.30 --> 1692.46]  they trust in Christ,
[1692.46 --> 1693.56]  they believe in Christ,
[1694.18 --> 1695.10]  and then justice
[1695.10 --> 1695.90]  and mercy
[1695.90 --> 1697.64]  often accompany
[1697.64 --> 1698.46]  that work
[1698.46 --> 1699.56]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1700.70 --> 1701.12]  And so,
[1701.22 --> 1701.76]  the church
[1701.76 --> 1702.82]  is renewed
[1702.82 --> 1704.56]  to live out
[1704.56 --> 1705.12]  the gospel
[1705.12 --> 1707.06]  in the community
[1707.06 --> 1707.76]  where they are.
[1708.28 --> 1709.20]  A revival.
[1710.84 --> 1711.78]  And really,
[1711.96 --> 1713.12]  when we pray,
[1714.12 --> 1715.30]  your kingdom come,
[1715.36 --> 1716.22]  your will be done,
[1716.58 --> 1717.96]  what we are praying for
[1717.96 --> 1718.46]  is,
[1719.10 --> 1719.40]  Lord,
[1719.84 --> 1721.26]  advance your kingdom.
[1721.26 --> 1722.68]  Lord,
[1722.78 --> 1723.36]  would you
[1723.36 --> 1724.94]  restore
[1724.94 --> 1727.00]  everything
[1727.00 --> 1728.22]  as you intended
[1728.22 --> 1728.92]  when you created
[1728.92 --> 1729.56]  this world?
[1730.40 --> 1731.44]  Would you advance
[1731.44 --> 1732.26]  your sovereign,
[1732.78 --> 1733.46]  saving,
[1733.76 --> 1734.20]  beautiful,
[1734.38 --> 1735.50]  restorative
[1735.50 --> 1736.44]  reign
[1736.44 --> 1737.74]  in every heart
[1737.74 --> 1739.48]  and in every place
[1739.48 --> 1740.70]  for the glory
[1740.70 --> 1741.56]  of your name,
[1741.68 --> 1742.56]  your kingdom come,
[1743.22 --> 1744.24]  your will be done.
[1744.96 --> 1745.62]  So now,
[1745.80 --> 1746.22]  today,
[1746.32 --> 1747.52]  let's go a bit deeper
[1747.52 --> 1749.40]  into this phrase,
[1749.40 --> 1750.72]  this petition
[1750.72 --> 1751.92]  that we pray to God
[1751.92 --> 1752.76]  and ask of him,
[1753.34 --> 1755.00]  your will be done.
[1756.36 --> 1757.14]  We're going to look
[1757.14 --> 1758.94]  at this in two parts today.
[1759.12 --> 1759.38]  First,
[1759.44 --> 1759.84]  we're going to ask
[1759.84 --> 1760.30]  the question,
[1760.74 --> 1761.88]  what is God's will?
[1763.10 --> 1764.22]  That's a big question.
[1764.40 --> 1765.10]  I hope maybe
[1765.10 --> 1765.98]  to give us
[1765.98 --> 1766.88]  a little bit
[1766.88 --> 1767.90]  of an idea
[1767.90 --> 1768.84]  of what that might mean.
[1768.92 --> 1769.50]  There's way more
[1769.50 --> 1770.20]  we could say
[1770.20 --> 1771.94]  that we won't be able to.
[1772.58 --> 1773.34]  So the question is,
[1773.34 --> 1773.82]  when we pray,
[1773.88 --> 1774.52]  your will be done,
[1774.60 --> 1776.00]  what are we asking God for?
[1776.00 --> 1776.72]  Secondly,
[1778.02 --> 1778.66]  we'll pray then,
[1778.96 --> 1779.90]  what does it look like
[1779.90 --> 1781.22]  for us to pray this prayer?
[1782.28 --> 1783.00]  When we pray,
[1783.12 --> 1784.10]  your will be done,
[1784.18 --> 1785.52]  and if God was to answer
[1785.52 --> 1787.40]  that prayer tomorrow,
[1788.16 --> 1789.68]  what would that look like?
[1791.14 --> 1792.04]  So first,
[1792.26 --> 1793.66]  what is God's will?
[1794.94 --> 1796.00]  If you're a Christian,
[1796.14 --> 1797.02]  you've probably prayed
[1797.02 --> 1798.04]  this petition before.
[1798.26 --> 1798.40]  You know,
[1798.44 --> 1799.50]  we're all so familiar
[1799.50 --> 1800.28]  with the Lord's Prayer
[1800.28 --> 1801.38]  and we can say it
[1801.38 --> 1802.14]  so smoothly
[1802.14 --> 1802.52]  and we say,
[1802.60 --> 1803.44]  your will be done,
[1803.74 --> 1804.68]  and then we move on.
[1804.68 --> 1806.42]  But what are we praying for
[1806.42 --> 1807.28]  when we say that?
[1807.62 --> 1808.92]  What is God's will?
[1810.28 --> 1811.50]  When the Bible talks
[1811.50 --> 1812.42]  about the will of God,
[1812.52 --> 1813.56]  there's a distinction
[1813.56 --> 1815.80]  that I think would be helpful
[1815.80 --> 1818.34]  for us to understand
[1818.34 --> 1820.08]  as we think about this prayer
[1820.08 --> 1821.20]  and as we pray this prayer.
[1822.12 --> 1823.06]  There's the,
[1823.52 --> 1824.10]  you know,
[1824.12 --> 1824.98]  I've been trying to practice
[1824.98 --> 1825.96]  saying these words
[1825.96 --> 1827.16]  and I'm going to
[1827.16 --> 1827.98]  mess them up a little bit,
[1828.04 --> 1829.64]  but the decorative will,
[1830.48 --> 1831.00]  I think that's how
[1831.00 --> 1831.58]  you pronounce it,
[1831.76 --> 1832.20]  and then there's
[1832.20 --> 1833.32]  the preceptive will.
[1833.80 --> 1834.66]  The decorative will,
[1835.38 --> 1836.04]  perceptive will.
[1836.26 --> 1837.20]  I think Bart will tell me
[1837.20 --> 1838.48]  how to say it later.
[1839.80 --> 1840.86]  So first,
[1841.48 --> 1842.84]  the decorative will of God.
[1843.52 --> 1844.56]  The decorative will
[1844.56 --> 1846.08]  is God's purposes,
[1847.24 --> 1850.26]  his plans that he enacts.
[1850.78 --> 1852.04]  It's sometimes referred to
[1852.04 --> 1853.10]  as God's sovereign,
[1853.34 --> 1854.34]  efficacious will.
[1854.46 --> 1855.02]  God is sovereign,
[1855.14 --> 1856.90]  he's the king of the universe.
[1857.72 --> 1858.82]  What he says,
[1858.88 --> 1860.12]  he has power and authority
[1860.12 --> 1860.88]  to accomplish
[1860.88 --> 1862.54]  all that he wants to do.
[1862.54 --> 1863.88]  And it's efficacious,
[1864.02 --> 1865.34]  meaning it's effective.
[1865.68 --> 1866.50]  When he says it,
[1866.58 --> 1868.28]  it will indeed happen.
[1869.06 --> 1869.94]  And so we can think of it
[1869.94 --> 1871.58]  as the decrees of God,
[1871.62 --> 1873.30]  like a king giving a decree.
[1874.44 --> 1876.02]  God makes happen
[1876.02 --> 1877.54]  whatever he pleases
[1877.54 --> 1880.76]  by his divine decrees.
[1881.28 --> 1882.56]  An example of this
[1882.56 --> 1885.40]  is in God's work of creation.
[1886.12 --> 1887.26]  When God said,
[1887.26 --> 1889.02]  let there be light,
[1889.86 --> 1892.26]  he issued a divine decree.
[1893.24 --> 1894.56]  It was impossible
[1894.56 --> 1897.92]  for light not to appear.
[1898.78 --> 1899.10]  Right?
[1899.18 --> 1901.68]  He didn't politely request
[1901.68 --> 1903.34]  light to appear.
[1903.62 --> 1905.98]  He didn't coax it into existence.
[1906.12 --> 1907.40]  He didn't kind of woo it,
[1907.88 --> 1908.70]  ask politely.
[1909.10 --> 1910.30]  He commanded,
[1910.64 --> 1911.40]  let there be light,
[1911.40 --> 1912.70]  and it happened.
[1913.68 --> 1914.44]  Now clearly,
[1914.62 --> 1915.54]  as human beings,
[1915.80 --> 1917.76]  we don't have this ability
[1917.76 --> 1920.02]  to declare something
[1920.02 --> 1922.10]  and have it immediately happen.
[1923.80 --> 1925.70]  We can't just will it
[1925.70 --> 1926.94]  to happen and make it so.
[1927.58 --> 1927.74]  Right?
[1927.78 --> 1928.02]  I mean,
[1928.08 --> 1928.56]  at home,
[1928.62 --> 1929.98]  I give commands all the time.
[1931.90 --> 1932.92]  Does it happen?
[1933.96 --> 1934.44]  No,
[1934.44 --> 1935.70]  not often.
[1936.18 --> 1936.28]  Right?
[1936.34 --> 1938.58]  I can decree all I want,
[1939.20 --> 1941.16]  but to no effect.
[1941.16 --> 1942.52]  My will is not sovereign
[1942.52 --> 1943.52]  or efficacious
[1943.52 --> 1944.56]  when it comes to
[1944.56 --> 1946.04]  always my children.
[1946.40 --> 1947.52]  I might even try to woo
[1947.52 --> 1948.22]  and coax them.
[1948.88 --> 1949.70]  That doesn't work either.
[1950.78 --> 1951.10]  Anyway,
[1952.18 --> 1953.38]  you know,
[1953.46 --> 1954.20]  I can't be driving
[1954.20 --> 1955.08]  down the road
[1955.08 --> 1955.72]  and say,
[1955.92 --> 1956.46]  green light,
[1956.64 --> 1957.64]  and the lights just turn green
[1957.64 --> 1958.46]  and I just go right through.
[1958.52 --> 1959.46]  We don't have that ability.
[1960.50 --> 1961.72]  So here's another example
[1961.72 --> 1964.28]  of God's decorative will.
[1964.74 --> 1966.46]  In Ephesians 1,
[1966.54 --> 1967.00]  verse 5,
[1967.08 --> 1967.74]  Paul says this,
[1967.78 --> 1969.48]  and love he predestined us
[1969.48 --> 1970.80]  for adoption to sonship.
[1971.16 --> 1972.46]  Through Jesus Christ
[1972.46 --> 1973.56]  in accordance with
[1973.56 --> 1974.64]  his pleasure
[1974.64 --> 1975.90]  and will.
[1977.02 --> 1977.24]  Right?
[1977.36 --> 1979.24]  God planned our adoption.
[1979.50 --> 1980.64]  God's purposed,
[1980.90 --> 1981.68]  he purposed,
[1982.06 --> 1983.42]  that he would make us
[1983.42 --> 1984.40]  his sons and daughters
[1984.40 --> 1985.66]  and bring us
[1985.66 --> 1987.22]  into a personal relationship
[1987.22 --> 1989.02]  with Jesus Christ
[1989.02 --> 1989.58]  or with God
[1989.58 --> 1990.36]  through Jesus Christ.
[1990.70 --> 1991.94]  This is God's sovereign
[1991.94 --> 1994.54]  will in our salvation.
[1995.18 --> 1995.50]  Right?
[1995.60 --> 1997.82]  He set his love upon us
[1997.82 --> 1999.44]  and he adopted us.
[1999.96 --> 2001.10]  He brought us to himself.
[2001.90 --> 2002.68]  So when we pray,
[2002.80 --> 2003.54]  your will be done,
[2003.60 --> 2004.52]  we are asking God
[2004.52 --> 2005.92]  to fulfill his plans
[2005.92 --> 2006.46]  and purposes.
[2007.26 --> 2007.40]  Right?
[2007.50 --> 2008.96]  God's decorative will.
[2009.56 --> 2010.76]  That's the first sense
[2010.76 --> 2011.80]  in which we pray this.
[2012.54 --> 2013.82]  But the Bible also talks
[2013.82 --> 2014.42]  about God's will
[2014.42 --> 2015.08]  in another way,
[2015.14 --> 2015.94]  in another sense.
[2016.74 --> 2019.36]  That is his prescriptive will.
[2020.02 --> 2021.00]  And what this is,
[2021.00 --> 2022.46]  it's God's desire
[2022.46 --> 2024.42]  that we would obey him.
[2025.56 --> 2026.70]  You can kind of think of it
[2026.70 --> 2028.04]  as his precepts.
[2028.88 --> 2029.96]  So listen to what
[2029.96 --> 2031.08]  the Apostle Paul writes
[2031.08 --> 2033.30]  in Romans 12,
[2033.48 --> 2034.18]  verses 1 and 2.
[2035.64 --> 2036.54]  He says,
[2037.14 --> 2037.48]  Therefore,
[2037.92 --> 2038.90]  I urge you,
[2038.96 --> 2039.74]  brothers and sisters,
[2039.86 --> 2040.92]  in view of God's mercy,
[2041.30 --> 2042.64]  to offer your bodies
[2042.64 --> 2044.28]  as a living sacrifice,
[2044.74 --> 2046.22]  holy and pleasing to God.
[2046.52 --> 2047.24]  This is your true
[2047.24 --> 2048.00]  and proper worship.
[2048.64 --> 2049.42]  Do not conform
[2049.42 --> 2050.68]  to the pattern of this world,
[2050.68 --> 2051.64]  but be transformed
[2051.64 --> 2053.36]  by the renewing of your mind,
[2053.80 --> 2054.80]  that you will be able
[2054.80 --> 2055.74]  to test and approve
[2055.74 --> 2056.80]  what God's will is,
[2056.94 --> 2058.08]  his good and pleasing
[2058.08 --> 2059.92]  and perfect will.
[2061.34 --> 2061.86]  Right?
[2061.94 --> 2063.04]  So Paul here is talking
[2063.04 --> 2064.46]  about God's will.
[2065.08 --> 2065.94]  But he's not talking
[2065.94 --> 2066.90]  about God's plan
[2066.90 --> 2067.58]  or purposes,
[2067.76 --> 2068.36]  his decrees.
[2068.70 --> 2069.64]  He's talking about
[2069.64 --> 2070.62]  our response
[2070.62 --> 2072.48]  to God saving us.
[2073.08 --> 2073.98]  Our response.
[2074.50 --> 2075.32]  God's will
[2075.32 --> 2076.92]  is that we live
[2076.92 --> 2077.78]  our lives
[2077.78 --> 2079.96]  in worship of God,
[2079.96 --> 2081.90]  and in obedience
[2081.90 --> 2083.04]  to God.
[2084.16 --> 2085.30]  So here's an example.
[2085.94 --> 2087.26]  God said to Adam and Eve,
[2088.06 --> 2088.86]  do not eat,
[2088.98 --> 2089.10]  you know,
[2089.14 --> 2090.02]  you can eat any
[2090.02 --> 2090.86]  of the fruit of the garden,
[2090.96 --> 2091.78]  but there's this one tree,
[2091.90 --> 2092.50]  don't eat the fruit
[2092.50 --> 2093.06]  of that tree.
[2093.78 --> 2094.76]  Did they obey him?
[2096.26 --> 2096.66]  No.
[2096.96 --> 2097.20]  Right?
[2097.74 --> 2098.34]  What did they do?
[2099.08 --> 2100.10]  They did their will.
[2100.30 --> 2101.28]  They didn't do God's will,
[2101.34 --> 2102.00]  they did their own will.
[2102.08 --> 2103.48]  They ate it anyway.
[2103.48 --> 2104.96]  So whereas
[2104.96 --> 2106.84]  it is not possible
[2106.84 --> 2107.58]  for the light
[2107.58 --> 2108.34]  to refuse
[2108.34 --> 2109.38]  to shine in creation,
[2110.36 --> 2111.52]  it is possible
[2111.52 --> 2112.48]  for us
[2112.48 --> 2113.30]  to refuse
[2113.30 --> 2114.74]  God's commandments.
[2115.76 --> 2117.00]  So God's
[2117.00 --> 2118.42]  prescriptive will,
[2118.64 --> 2119.28]  it's us
[2119.28 --> 2120.06]  living
[2120.06 --> 2121.08]  as his children
[2121.08 --> 2122.20]  in humble obedience
[2122.20 --> 2123.02]  to him.
[2124.06 --> 2125.16]  In this sense,
[2125.22 --> 2125.92]  when we pray,
[2126.26 --> 2127.04]  your will be done,
[2127.10 --> 2127.92]  we are asking God
[2127.92 --> 2129.64]  to form our wills,
[2129.94 --> 2130.98]  to shape us,
[2130.98 --> 2132.36]  to bend our wills
[2132.36 --> 2132.88]  to whatever
[2132.88 --> 2134.40]  delights and pleases
[2134.40 --> 2135.20]  God.
[2136.28 --> 2137.32]  So we no longer
[2137.32 --> 2138.34]  live for ourselves,
[2138.46 --> 2139.00]  we don't pray,
[2139.20 --> 2139.90]  my kingdom come,
[2140.02 --> 2140.96]  my will be done,
[2141.22 --> 2141.62]  we pray,
[2141.84 --> 2142.64]  your kingdom come,
[2142.72 --> 2143.58]  your will be done,
[2143.62 --> 2145.54]  and we shape our lives
[2145.54 --> 2146.54]  in accordance
[2146.54 --> 2148.22]  with God's good pleasure
[2148.22 --> 2149.72]  for how he wants
[2149.72 --> 2150.76]  his children to live.
[2153.08 --> 2154.42]  So when we look at this,
[2154.52 --> 2155.32]  we're thinking about
[2155.32 --> 2156.02]  what does it mean
[2156.02 --> 2157.78]  to pray,
[2158.00 --> 2159.22]  your will be done.
[2159.22 --> 2161.42]  And we're saying
[2161.42 --> 2162.10]  that we're praying
[2162.10 --> 2163.06]  for God's purposes
[2163.06 --> 2164.86]  and God's pleasure
[2164.86 --> 2165.84]  to be done.
[2166.32 --> 2166.82]  We're asking
[2166.82 --> 2167.72]  that God's kingdom,
[2168.16 --> 2168.82]  his rule,
[2169.42 --> 2170.38]  the way he created
[2170.38 --> 2171.22]  the world to be
[2171.22 --> 2172.42]  would be manifest
[2172.42 --> 2173.74]  in our reality.
[2174.10 --> 2174.58]  We're praying
[2174.58 --> 2175.32]  that his love
[2175.32 --> 2175.92]  and his mercy
[2175.92 --> 2176.76]  and his justice,
[2177.24 --> 2178.00]  his reconciliation,
[2178.40 --> 2178.82]  all of this
[2178.82 --> 2179.92]  would be experienced
[2179.92 --> 2181.76]  in our world today,
[2181.86 --> 2182.86]  on earth,
[2182.94 --> 2183.84]  as it is in heaven.
[2184.36 --> 2184.58]  Right?
[2184.60 --> 2185.02]  We're not praying
[2185.02 --> 2185.48]  for God's will
[2185.48 --> 2186.20]  to be done in heaven,
[2186.60 --> 2187.48]  God's will is done
[2187.48 --> 2188.38]  in heaven perfectly
[2188.38 --> 2189.20]  all the time,
[2189.50 --> 2190.42]  but it's not
[2190.42 --> 2190.94]  on earth,
[2190.98 --> 2191.30]  is it?
[2191.96 --> 2192.46]  So we're praying,
[2192.54 --> 2192.68]  God,
[2192.76 --> 2193.18]  would your will
[2193.18 --> 2193.84]  that is done
[2193.84 --> 2194.48]  in heaven,
[2194.56 --> 2196.14]  would it come here
[2196.14 --> 2197.12]  and be done
[2197.12 --> 2198.48]  on earth?
[2200.36 --> 2201.20]  And we're praying
[2201.20 --> 2201.86]  that we would be
[2201.86 --> 2202.44]  a part of it,
[2203.24 --> 2205.10]  that his will
[2205.10 --> 2205.68]  would come
[2205.68 --> 2206.58]  and take shape
[2206.58 --> 2207.68]  in us as well.
[2208.50 --> 2209.60]  So there's a story
[2209.60 --> 2210.26]  in the gospel
[2210.26 --> 2211.42]  where we see
[2211.42 --> 2212.34]  these two senses
[2212.34 --> 2213.14]  of God's will,
[2213.50 --> 2214.20]  God's purposes
[2214.20 --> 2215.34]  and God's pleasure,
[2215.98 --> 2216.92]  come together,
[2217.20 --> 2218.28]  but in this story,
[2218.28 --> 2219.20]  they're not
[2219.20 --> 2219.72]  in harmony.
[2220.66 --> 2221.16]  So I'll show you
[2221.16 --> 2221.62]  what I mean.
[2222.10 --> 2222.46]  So we're going
[2222.46 --> 2223.14]  to go to Mark
[2223.14 --> 2224.00]  chapter 1
[2224.00 --> 2225.44]  and this is
[2225.44 --> 2225.96]  at the very
[2225.96 --> 2228.12]  end of the chapter,
[2228.44 --> 2228.96]  beginning in
[2228.96 --> 2229.94]  around verse 40.
[2229.94 --> 2232.80]  And here we see
[2232.80 --> 2233.72]  a leper.
[2234.56 --> 2235.34]  And everyone
[2235.34 --> 2236.30]  can tell
[2236.30 --> 2237.24]  he's a leper
[2237.24 --> 2238.08]  because why?
[2238.38 --> 2239.42]  Well, his hands
[2239.42 --> 2240.04]  and his feet
[2240.04 --> 2240.88]  are bandaged
[2240.88 --> 2242.18]  because they are
[2242.18 --> 2242.90]  rotting away.
[2243.10 --> 2244.12]  He's all bandaged up.
[2244.38 --> 2245.68]  And everyone knows
[2245.68 --> 2246.28]  he's a leper.
[2246.80 --> 2247.60]  And they know
[2247.60 --> 2248.26]  that you should not
[2248.26 --> 2248.92]  touch a leper.
[2249.54 --> 2250.72]  Now, in the first century,
[2250.72 --> 2251.78]  it was thought
[2251.78 --> 2252.52]  that leprosy
[2252.52 --> 2253.32]  was very contagious.
[2253.46 --> 2254.08]  We now know
[2254.08 --> 2255.36]  that it's actually not.
[2255.36 --> 2258.60]  But it means,
[2258.72 --> 2258.80]  though,
[2258.80 --> 2259.56]  because they had
[2259.56 --> 2260.54]  that faulty belief,
[2260.64 --> 2261.76]  it means that this man
[2261.76 --> 2263.48]  never touched
[2263.48 --> 2264.54]  his family,
[2264.86 --> 2265.52]  his kids,
[2265.66 --> 2266.20]  or his wife.
[2266.24 --> 2267.10]  He never touched them
[2267.10 --> 2267.92]  since the day
[2267.92 --> 2268.84]  of his diagnosis.
[2269.64 --> 2270.44]  Now, that would be
[2270.44 --> 2271.24]  so hard for us
[2271.24 --> 2271.78]  to imagine.
[2272.48 --> 2273.34]  That since the day
[2273.34 --> 2274.02]  of this diagnosis,
[2274.02 --> 2275.56]  he has not experienced
[2275.56 --> 2276.32]  human touch,
[2276.32 --> 2277.08]  and really,
[2277.28 --> 2277.86]  he has simply
[2277.86 --> 2279.10]  watched himself die,
[2279.76 --> 2281.64]  centimeter by centimeter.
[2282.80 --> 2283.94]  And this leper
[2283.94 --> 2285.58]  approaches Jesus.
[2286.36 --> 2287.24]  And the crowd
[2287.24 --> 2288.76]  makes way
[2288.76 --> 2289.78]  and steps back
[2289.78 --> 2290.82]  because this man
[2290.82 --> 2291.56]  is coming up
[2291.56 --> 2292.74]  with the smell
[2292.74 --> 2293.38]  of death
[2293.38 --> 2294.22]  on his body.
[2295.24 --> 2296.12]  And this leper
[2296.12 --> 2297.98]  falls at the feet
[2297.98 --> 2299.00]  of Jesus.
[2299.18 --> 2300.36]  He falls to his knees.
[2300.60 --> 2301.36]  He is desperate.
[2301.82 --> 2303.04]  And this is what he says.
[2304.40 --> 2305.14]  He says,
[2305.14 --> 2307.68]  if you are willing,
[2308.18 --> 2309.56]  you can make me clean.
[2311.14 --> 2311.90]  Look at that.
[2311.96 --> 2312.34]  It's a really
[2312.34 --> 2313.28]  interesting line.
[2313.82 --> 2315.64]  If you are willing,
[2316.18 --> 2317.98]  you can make me clean.
[2318.06 --> 2319.34]  You can make me clean
[2319.34 --> 2320.06]  if you are willing.
[2320.88 --> 2321.18]  Right?
[2321.24 --> 2322.02]  Because this leper
[2322.02 --> 2322.62]  knows something
[2322.62 --> 2323.24]  about Jesus.
[2323.50 --> 2324.84]  He knows Jesus
[2324.84 --> 2326.74]  can make him clean.
[2327.64 --> 2327.90]  Right?
[2327.94 --> 2328.82]  He must have seen
[2328.82 --> 2330.20]  Jesus heal the sick
[2330.20 --> 2330.62]  before,
[2330.74 --> 2331.54]  or at least he's heard
[2331.54 --> 2332.38]  of all these stories
[2332.38 --> 2333.68]  of Jesus healing
[2333.68 --> 2334.96]  all kinds of
[2334.96 --> 2335.70]  infirmities.
[2336.04 --> 2337.28]  He knows Jesus
[2337.28 --> 2338.64]  is powerful.
[2339.60 --> 2340.26]  But there's something
[2340.26 --> 2341.60]  he doesn't know
[2341.60 --> 2342.52]  about Jesus.
[2342.64 --> 2343.24]  He doesn't know
[2343.24 --> 2344.66]  if Jesus is willing.
[2345.72 --> 2346.64]  He doesn't know
[2346.64 --> 2348.32]  if Jesus cares.
[2349.50 --> 2351.08]  If you are willing,
[2351.64 --> 2353.68]  you can make me clean.
[2354.14 --> 2355.20]  But I'm not sure
[2355.20 --> 2356.34]  if you're willing.
[2356.34 --> 2359.36]  So this man is going
[2359.36 --> 2359.90]  to learn something
[2359.90 --> 2361.92]  amazing now
[2361.92 --> 2363.00]  about Jesus.
[2363.80 --> 2364.74]  It says
[2364.74 --> 2366.30]  in the next part,
[2367.48 --> 2368.66]  Jesus reached out
[2368.66 --> 2369.40]  his hand
[2369.40 --> 2370.76]  and touched
[2370.76 --> 2371.50]  the man.
[2372.94 --> 2373.10]  Right?
[2373.16 --> 2373.74]  Just think about that
[2373.74 --> 2374.18]  for a second.
[2374.56 --> 2375.58]  Jesus didn't have
[2375.58 --> 2376.20]  to touch him,
[2376.24 --> 2376.48]  did he?
[2377.36 --> 2378.44]  Just as God said,
[2378.66 --> 2379.80]  let there be light,
[2379.86 --> 2381.24]  and there was light,
[2381.24 --> 2382.68]  Jesus could have
[2382.68 --> 2383.62]  just said,
[2384.06 --> 2385.76]  be healed,
[2385.92 --> 2386.48]  and he could have
[2386.48 --> 2387.06]  healed him
[2387.06 --> 2388.04]  with a word.
[2389.32 --> 2390.48]  But what amazing
[2390.48 --> 2391.30]  compassion
[2391.30 --> 2393.14]  for this leper
[2393.14 --> 2393.96]  in that touch
[2393.96 --> 2394.52]  of Jesus
[2394.52 --> 2396.26]  who hadn't been
[2396.26 --> 2397.36]  touched for so long.
[2399.56 --> 2400.58]  It goes on,
[2400.58 --> 2401.40]  Jesus reached out
[2401.40 --> 2401.96]  his hand
[2401.96 --> 2402.40]  and touched
[2402.40 --> 2402.88]  the man.
[2404.22 --> 2405.86]  I am willing,
[2406.84 --> 2407.36]  he said,
[2407.94 --> 2408.54]  be clean.
[2409.90 --> 2410.50]  Immediately,
[2411.64 --> 2412.28]  the leprosy
[2412.28 --> 2412.78]  left him,
[2413.18 --> 2415.12]  and he was clean.
[2416.46 --> 2417.44]  God's decorative
[2417.44 --> 2417.88]  will,
[2418.06 --> 2419.18]  immediately it happened.
[2420.82 --> 2421.30]  And clean,
[2421.44 --> 2421.76]  of course,
[2421.86 --> 2423.78]  means he was well.
[2424.30 --> 2424.50]  Right?
[2424.56 --> 2425.10]  He was healed
[2425.10 --> 2425.72]  emotionally.
[2426.28 --> 2427.18]  Think about the joy
[2427.18 --> 2428.02]  he would have had.
[2428.86 --> 2429.40]  He was healed
[2429.40 --> 2430.28]  relationally.
[2430.28 --> 2431.00]  Think about him
[2431.00 --> 2432.12]  being reconciled
[2432.12 --> 2432.84]  and hugging
[2432.84 --> 2433.44]  his children
[2433.44 --> 2434.78]  and his wife.
[2436.20 --> 2437.24]  He was certainly
[2437.24 --> 2438.06]  healed physically.
[2439.48 --> 2440.28]  His fingers
[2441.00 --> 2441.50]  and toes
[2441.50 --> 2442.66]  aren't falling off.
[2443.12 --> 2444.42]  And now he knows
[2444.42 --> 2445.24]  the love
[2445.24 --> 2446.90]  and compassion
[2446.90 --> 2447.52]  and power
[2447.52 --> 2447.92]  of God
[2447.92 --> 2448.48]  in his life.
[2449.80 --> 2450.02]  Right?
[2450.10 --> 2450.56]  In Jesus,
[2450.70 --> 2451.96]  we see God's purpose
[2451.96 --> 2453.24]  to heal
[2453.24 --> 2453.68]  and mend
[2453.68 --> 2454.44]  everything broken
[2454.44 --> 2454.96]  by sin.
[2456.24 --> 2457.14]  But also
[2457.14 --> 2458.08]  in this story,
[2458.36 --> 2459.62]  there's an example
[2459.62 --> 2460.28]  of God's
[2460.28 --> 2461.20]  perceptive will.
[2462.20 --> 2463.18]  So in the very
[2463.18 --> 2463.98]  next verse,
[2464.08 --> 2465.00]  in verse 43,
[2465.88 --> 2466.68]  it goes on.
[2467.08 --> 2467.60]  It says,
[2468.04 --> 2468.88]  Jesus sent him
[2468.88 --> 2469.72]  away at once
[2469.72 --> 2470.50]  with a strong
[2470.50 --> 2470.98]  warning,
[2471.62 --> 2472.58]  see that you
[2472.58 --> 2473.44]  don't tell this
[2473.44 --> 2473.90]  to anyone.
[2474.90 --> 2475.30]  Right?
[2475.40 --> 2475.98]  Jesus healed
[2475.98 --> 2476.58]  this man
[2476.58 --> 2477.58]  and he gives
[2477.58 --> 2478.30]  him a command.
[2479.14 --> 2479.96]  Jesus was having
[2479.96 --> 2481.02]  trouble with the crowds.
[2481.46 --> 2482.04]  There were people
[2482.04 --> 2482.82]  mobbing him
[2482.82 --> 2483.36]  all the time.
[2483.46 --> 2483.88]  He didn't want
[2483.88 --> 2484.30]  to make it
[2484.30 --> 2485.28]  any worse
[2485.28 --> 2486.80]  in such a way
[2486.80 --> 2487.38]  it would hinder
[2487.38 --> 2488.12]  his ministry
[2488.12 --> 2488.70]  any further.
[2489.02 --> 2489.52]  So he said,
[2489.60 --> 2489.76]  look,
[2491.00 --> 2492.40]  I'm happy to heal you.
[2492.48 --> 2493.38]  Just don't tell anybody.
[2493.50 --> 2493.68]  Okay?
[2494.10 --> 2495.16]  So what did this guy do?
[2496.62 --> 2497.52]  It says,
[2498.14 --> 2499.16]  the next verse,
[2499.86 --> 2500.26]  instead,
[2501.26 --> 2501.64]  keyword,
[2502.60 --> 2503.26]  God said,
[2503.64 --> 2504.24]  but instead,
[2505.08 --> 2505.76]  he went out
[2505.76 --> 2506.76]  and began to talk
[2506.76 --> 2507.46]  freely,
[2507.98 --> 2508.82]  spreading the news.
[2509.02 --> 2509.64]  As a result,
[2509.76 --> 2510.64]  Jesus could no longer
[2510.64 --> 2511.58]  enter a town openly,
[2511.58 --> 2512.86]  but stayed outside
[2512.86 --> 2513.78]  in lonely places.
[2514.58 --> 2515.22]  Yet the people
[2515.22 --> 2515.96]  still came to him
[2515.96 --> 2516.54]  from everywhere.
[2517.58 --> 2517.76]  Right?
[2517.86 --> 2518.40]  This man
[2518.40 --> 2519.54]  didn't obey
[2519.54 --> 2520.44]  Jesus.
[2521.14 --> 2521.92]  He was willing
[2521.92 --> 2522.48]  to pray,
[2522.94 --> 2523.96]  your will be done,
[2524.84 --> 2525.36]  when it was
[2525.36 --> 2526.10]  for his own healing.
[2527.18 --> 2528.20]  And he discovered
[2528.20 --> 2528.84]  God's will.
[2529.28 --> 2530.32]  God's will,
[2530.74 --> 2531.64]  his decorative will
[2531.64 --> 2532.10]  that was able
[2532.10 --> 2532.72]  to heal him
[2532.72 --> 2533.26]  with a word
[2533.26 --> 2534.30]  and a touch.
[2535.64 --> 2536.56]  But when it
[2536.56 --> 2537.42]  constrained
[2537.42 --> 2539.06]  his own will,
[2539.48 --> 2540.80]  his own plans
[2540.80 --> 2541.44]  and what he
[2541.44 --> 2542.20]  wanted to do,
[2542.50 --> 2543.24]  he talked freely.
[2543.90 --> 2544.30]  He didn't want
[2544.30 --> 2545.06]  to be constrained
[2545.06 --> 2546.56]  by Jesus' command.
[2548.10 --> 2548.96]  And that really
[2548.96 --> 2549.60]  leads us to
[2549.60 --> 2550.22]  the second point
[2550.22 --> 2550.68]  this morning,
[2550.78 --> 2551.38]  which is,
[2551.94 --> 2552.50]  how do we
[2552.50 --> 2553.54]  practically pray
[2553.54 --> 2554.48]  for God's will
[2554.48 --> 2555.26]  to be done?
[2555.48 --> 2556.36]  What does it look
[2556.36 --> 2557.02]  like for us
[2557.02 --> 2557.72]  to pray
[2557.72 --> 2558.76]  in this way?
[2559.80 --> 2560.02]  Okay,
[2560.06 --> 2560.68]  so let's think
[2560.68 --> 2561.38]  about this together.
[2561.76 --> 2561.92]  Well,
[2562.08 --> 2562.68]  first,
[2562.80 --> 2563.50]  the first question
[2563.50 --> 2563.98]  is,
[2564.08 --> 2564.98]  to pray your will
[2564.98 --> 2565.40]  be done,
[2565.46 --> 2565.86]  what do we have
[2565.86 --> 2566.18]  to know?
[2567.92 --> 2568.82]  What's God's will?
[2569.10 --> 2569.22]  Right?
[2569.24 --> 2569.56]  What does he
[2569.56 --> 2570.20]  want us to do?
[2571.12 --> 2571.72]  We need to know
[2571.72 --> 2572.48]  what his will is.
[2572.56 --> 2572.78]  And so,
[2572.88 --> 2573.04]  friends,
[2573.12 --> 2573.86]  where's the place
[2573.86 --> 2574.80]  where God reveals
[2574.80 --> 2575.66]  his will to us?
[2576.46 --> 2577.30]  You can say it.
[2579.38 --> 2580.02]  The Bible.
[2580.48 --> 2580.80]  Exactly.
[2581.06 --> 2581.48]  The Bible.
[2581.88 --> 2582.50]  So what do we do?
[2582.54 --> 2583.00]  We need to read
[2583.00 --> 2583.60]  the Bible, right?
[2584.52 --> 2585.04]  How do we know
[2585.04 --> 2585.50]  God's will?
[2585.66 --> 2586.82]  We open the Bible.
[2586.94 --> 2587.46]  We read it.
[2588.76 --> 2589.38]  So, okay,
[2589.52 --> 2590.20]  we're going to read
[2590.20 --> 2590.60]  God's,
[2591.12 --> 2591.80]  the Bible,
[2591.92 --> 2592.30]  we're going to know,
[2592.36 --> 2592.98]  try to see what
[2592.98 --> 2593.88]  God's will is.
[2593.94 --> 2594.86]  He tells us in the Bible.
[2595.86 --> 2596.58]  So let's say
[2596.58 --> 2597.68]  we open the Bible
[2597.68 --> 2598.96]  and let's read,
[2599.18 --> 2599.84]  we're going to read
[2599.84 --> 2600.32]  this verse,
[2600.46 --> 2602.10]  Revelation chapter 7,
[2602.16 --> 2602.58]  verse 9.
[2603.52 --> 2604.70]  So listen to this.
[2604.82 --> 2605.62]  This is what it says.
[2606.30 --> 2607.22]  This is what we read.
[2607.32 --> 2607.88]  After this,
[2607.94 --> 2608.42]  I looked,
[2609.02 --> 2610.16]  and there before me
[2610.16 --> 2611.24]  was a great multitude
[2611.24 --> 2612.70]  that no one could count
[2612.70 --> 2614.00]  from every nation,
[2614.18 --> 2614.46]  tribe,
[2614.60 --> 2614.96]  people,
[2615.06 --> 2615.68]  and language
[2615.68 --> 2617.82]  standing before the throne
[2617.82 --> 2618.98]  and before the Lamb.
[2618.98 --> 2620.34]  They were wearing
[2620.34 --> 2621.36]  white robes
[2621.36 --> 2622.46]  and were holding
[2622.46 --> 2623.34]  palm branches
[2623.34 --> 2625.16]  in their hands.
[2627.36 --> 2629.08]  This is the perfect
[2629.08 --> 2630.22]  plan and purpose
[2630.22 --> 2630.76]  of God,
[2631.32 --> 2631.44]  right?
[2631.48 --> 2632.32]  That one day
[2632.32 --> 2633.08]  the church
[2633.08 --> 2634.72]  will be a harmonious
[2634.72 --> 2635.26]  community.
[2635.98 --> 2636.72]  The church
[2636.72 --> 2637.56]  as God's people
[2637.56 --> 2639.12]  from all these
[2639.12 --> 2639.90]  different nations,
[2640.04 --> 2640.94]  all these different peoples,
[2641.10 --> 2642.42]  all these different languages
[2642.42 --> 2644.16]  worshiping God
[2644.16 --> 2645.14]  together.
[2646.28 --> 2647.56]  It's this beautiful
[2647.56 --> 2648.70]  picture of diversity
[2648.70 --> 2649.62]  and unity,
[2649.80 --> 2650.64]  all of our differences
[2650.64 --> 2651.62]  and yet one people
[2651.62 --> 2652.10]  of God.
[2652.40 --> 2653.42]  This is God's will.
[2653.56 --> 2654.28]  This is in heaven,
[2654.40 --> 2654.66]  literally.
[2655.98 --> 2657.42]  This is God's will.
[2658.48 --> 2660.16]  Now what would it look like
[2660.16 --> 2661.48]  to pray this prayer?
[2662.36 --> 2663.28]  To pray
[2663.28 --> 2664.92]  your will be done.
[2665.70 --> 2666.54]  When we read
[2666.54 --> 2667.42]  Revelation 7,
[2667.66 --> 2668.44]  9
[2668.44 --> 2669.62]  and we pray this prayer,
[2670.08 --> 2671.10]  it comes to us
[2671.10 --> 2672.46]  as a hope
[2672.46 --> 2674.18]  and as a challenge.
[2674.80 --> 2675.48]  This should be
[2675.48 --> 2676.08]  a hope
[2676.08 --> 2677.42]  and a challenge
[2677.42 --> 2678.86]  to all of us.
[2679.92 --> 2680.40]  First,
[2680.62 --> 2681.54]  we pray
[2681.54 --> 2682.86]  your will be done
[2682.86 --> 2683.78]  as a hope.
[2684.52 --> 2685.26]  Whenever we pray
[2685.26 --> 2686.22]  your will be done,
[2686.52 --> 2687.28]  it's as a hope.
[2687.92 --> 2689.12]  In this first sense
[2689.12 --> 2689.78]  of God's will,
[2689.86 --> 2690.84]  his decorative will,
[2691.02 --> 2692.04]  we're able to place
[2692.04 --> 2693.24]  our hope
[2693.24 --> 2694.78]  in the purposes
[2694.78 --> 2695.86]  and plans of God
[2695.86 --> 2696.72]  which will
[2696.72 --> 2698.20]  be fully realized
[2698.20 --> 2699.22]  when Jesus returns.
[2700.30 --> 2700.52]  Right?
[2700.58 --> 2700.92]  We pray,
[2701.12 --> 2701.38]  Father,
[2701.62 --> 2702.60]  your will be done.
[2702.60 --> 2704.38]  And we say,
[2704.54 --> 2705.00]  God,
[2705.12 --> 2706.60]  even without me,
[2706.94 --> 2707.90]  you will
[2707.90 --> 2709.08]  have your way.
[2709.76 --> 2710.96]  You will bring
[2710.96 --> 2711.78]  your plans
[2711.78 --> 2712.54]  and your promises
[2712.54 --> 2714.18]  of Revelation 7,
[2714.30 --> 2714.66]  9
[2714.66 --> 2715.94]  to completion
[2715.94 --> 2717.06]  because this is
[2717.06 --> 2717.44]  your will.
[2718.96 --> 2719.92]  So we pray
[2719.92 --> 2720.66]  as a hope,
[2721.16 --> 2722.26]  as an expectation,
[2722.68 --> 2723.42]  asking God
[2723.42 --> 2724.26]  for his purposes
[2724.26 --> 2724.96]  to be done.
[2725.06 --> 2725.46]  We pray,
[2725.58 --> 2725.78]  God,
[2725.88 --> 2726.96]  would you accomplish
[2726.96 --> 2727.48]  this?
[2727.54 --> 2728.08]  We read it
[2728.08 --> 2728.68]  in your Bible.
[2729.32 --> 2729.86]  We know
[2729.86 --> 2730.94]  this is your heart.
[2731.92 --> 2732.40]  Do it,
[2732.50 --> 2732.80]  God.
[2733.22 --> 2733.94]  We pray it.
[2734.00 --> 2734.94]  Your will be done.
[2735.48 --> 2736.14]  We pray for
[2736.14 --> 2737.20]  his decorative will
[2737.20 --> 2738.32]  to be accomplished
[2738.32 --> 2739.04]  and we know
[2739.04 --> 2739.52]  it will be.
[2740.50 --> 2741.22]  But second,
[2741.34 --> 2742.10]  not only do we pray
[2742.10 --> 2742.82]  as a hope,
[2742.88 --> 2743.34]  when we pray
[2743.34 --> 2744.26]  your will be done,
[2744.46 --> 2745.78]  we pray as a challenge.
[2746.76 --> 2747.56]  And this is probably
[2747.56 --> 2748.74]  the hardest part
[2748.74 --> 2750.12]  of praying this prayer,
[2750.24 --> 2751.00]  your will be done.
[2751.48 --> 2752.50]  Because some of us,
[2752.60 --> 2753.06]  when we say,
[2753.20 --> 2753.40]  okay,
[2753.52 --> 2753.66]  well,
[2753.70 --> 2754.30]  it's a hope,
[2754.64 --> 2755.64]  God's going to do it,
[2756.20 --> 2756.90]  maybe we feel
[2756.90 --> 2757.78]  a sense of relief
[2757.78 --> 2759.34]  that God's plan
[2759.34 --> 2760.42]  will come to completion
[2760.42 --> 2761.48]  no matter what,
[2761.84 --> 2762.90]  whether or not
[2762.90 --> 2765.50]  I have to get involved,
[2766.02 --> 2766.72]  whether or not
[2766.72 --> 2768.42]  I need to change
[2768.42 --> 2769.36]  or not.
[2770.24 --> 2770.74]  But friends,
[2770.80 --> 2771.54]  that can't be farther
[2771.54 --> 2772.26]  from the truth.
[2773.28 --> 2774.58]  Because when we pray
[2774.58 --> 2776.36]  this prayer sincerely,
[2777.50 --> 2778.64]  when we pray it
[2778.64 --> 2780.06]  with our hearts,
[2781.06 --> 2782.74]  desire God's will
[2782.74 --> 2783.36]  to be done,
[2784.08 --> 2785.06]  it should move us
[2785.06 --> 2786.68]  then to the second sense
[2786.68 --> 2787.46]  of God's will,
[2787.46 --> 2788.88]  which is God's pleasure,
[2789.46 --> 2790.64]  his preceptive will.
[2791.62 --> 2792.42]  By praying
[2792.42 --> 2793.54]  your will be done,
[2794.28 --> 2795.58]  it's a recentering
[2795.58 --> 2797.42]  of whose plan,
[2797.94 --> 2798.64]  whose will
[2798.64 --> 2800.00]  I am living for.
[2800.90 --> 2802.00]  Is it mine?
[2803.02 --> 2804.16]  Am I living for
[2804.16 --> 2806.46]  like this man,
[2806.56 --> 2807.02]  the leper,
[2807.32 --> 2808.32]  what I want to do?
[2810.22 --> 2811.40]  Freely talk,
[2811.78 --> 2811.96]  right?
[2812.10 --> 2813.28]  Freely do what I want,
[2813.36 --> 2813.86]  my kingdom,
[2814.02 --> 2814.44]  my will,
[2814.44 --> 2816.26]  or are we living
[2816.26 --> 2817.46]  when we say
[2817.46 --> 2818.40]  your will be done,
[2818.48 --> 2819.12]  are we living
[2819.12 --> 2820.22]  according to God's will?
[2820.56 --> 2821.98]  Are we desiring it?
[2822.04 --> 2822.78]  Are we hoping
[2822.78 --> 2823.82]  that our hearts
[2823.82 --> 2825.26]  would be shaped
[2825.26 --> 2826.52]  to desire
[2826.52 --> 2827.50]  the same things
[2827.50 --> 2828.22]  as him?
[2828.98 --> 2829.74]  Because friends,
[2829.86 --> 2831.12]  if you are a Christian,
[2831.76 --> 2832.64]  Revelation 7,
[2832.76 --> 2833.08]  9
[2833.08 --> 2834.98]  is also your future.
[2835.98 --> 2836.30]  Right?
[2836.38 --> 2837.70]  You will be standing there
[2837.70 --> 2839.68]  before the throne of God
[2839.68 --> 2840.12]  with people
[2840.12 --> 2841.02]  from every tongue,
[2841.14 --> 2841.42]  tribe,
[2841.42 --> 2841.96]  and nation,
[2842.64 --> 2843.38]  people of all
[2843.38 --> 2844.80]  these different ethnicities
[2844.80 --> 2845.66]  praying,
[2845.78 --> 2846.56]  as we heard today,
[2846.76 --> 2848.00]  prayed in Dutch
[2848.00 --> 2849.62]  for God's kingdom
[2849.62 --> 2850.02]  to come
[2850.02 --> 2850.86]  and his will to be done.
[2851.18 --> 2852.48]  And it will be done then.
[2853.76 --> 2854.58]  And so when we pray
[2854.58 --> 2855.28]  your will be done,
[2855.34 --> 2855.72]  what does it do?
[2855.78 --> 2856.68]  It turns a spotlight
[2856.68 --> 2857.58]  to our own hearts.
[2858.34 --> 2859.68]  It inspects our hearts.
[2859.76 --> 2860.82]  It reveals our hearts.
[2860.94 --> 2862.00]  Do we desire
[2862.00 --> 2863.86]  what God desires?
[2866.18 --> 2866.96]  N.T. Wright
[2866.96 --> 2867.92]  puts it this way.
[2868.48 --> 2869.06]  Here's a quote
[2869.06 --> 2869.78]  I'll share with you.
[2870.36 --> 2870.68]  He says,
[2870.68 --> 2871.46]  I used to think
[2871.46 --> 2872.32]  of this clause
[2872.32 --> 2873.42]  simply as a prayer
[2873.42 --> 2874.56]  of resignation.
[2875.12 --> 2876.12]  Thy will be done
[2876.12 --> 2876.92]  with a shrug
[2876.92 --> 2877.52]  of the shoulders.
[2878.80 --> 2879.60]  What I want
[2879.60 --> 2880.74]  doesn't matter too much.
[2880.76 --> 2881.82]  If God really wants
[2881.82 --> 2882.56]  to do something,
[2882.98 --> 2884.02]  I suppose I can put up
[2884.02 --> 2884.44]  with it.
[2885.16 --> 2885.66]  But no.
[2886.52 --> 2888.06]  This is the risky,
[2888.32 --> 2889.22]  crazy prayer
[2889.22 --> 2891.02]  of submission
[2891.02 --> 2893.34]  and commission.
[2894.08 --> 2895.00]  It is the way
[2895.00 --> 2896.14]  we sign on
[2896.14 --> 2897.18]  in our turn
[2897.18 --> 2898.14]  for the work
[2898.14 --> 2898.62]  of the kingdom.
[2899.96 --> 2900.06]  Right?
[2900.14 --> 2900.50]  And so friends,
[2900.50 --> 2901.42]  this is the paradox
[2901.42 --> 2902.40]  of the Lord's prayer.
[2903.32 --> 2903.96]  This petition
[2903.96 --> 2904.90]  calls upon God
[2904.90 --> 2906.18]  to do what only God
[2906.18 --> 2906.56]  can do.
[2906.94 --> 2907.96]  Only God can do
[2907.96 --> 2908.48]  His will.
[2912.62 --> 2913.76]  So on the one hand,
[2913.90 --> 2915.04]  God alone
[2915.04 --> 2916.08]  can do His will
[2916.08 --> 2916.76]  on earth
[2916.76 --> 2917.60]  as it is in heaven.
[2918.06 --> 2919.00]  But there's another
[2919.00 --> 2920.34]  side of the paradox.
[2920.98 --> 2921.40]  To pray,
[2921.54 --> 2922.32]  your will be done,
[2922.40 --> 2923.04]  means that we
[2923.04 --> 2924.50]  pledge ourselves
[2924.50 --> 2926.60]  to make God's will
[2926.60 --> 2928.66]  our ultimate concern.
[2928.66 --> 2930.60]  So that's the paradox.
[2930.72 --> 2931.28]  On the one hand,
[2931.34 --> 2932.36]  only God can do it.
[2932.58 --> 2933.28]  On the other hand,
[2933.32 --> 2934.52]  we pledge ourselves
[2934.52 --> 2935.48]  in praying this prayer
[2935.48 --> 2937.04]  to do God's will
[2937.04 --> 2938.48]  in our lives
[2938.48 --> 2940.00]  and to do God's will
[2940.00 --> 2940.96]  in the world.
[2941.96 --> 2942.68]  So praying,
[2942.80 --> 2943.54]  your will be done
[2943.54 --> 2943.86]  on earth
[2943.86 --> 2944.72]  as it is in heaven.
[2945.18 --> 2946.16]  We pray that
[2946.16 --> 2946.60]  and what does it do?
[2946.64 --> 2947.62]  It leads us into action.
[2948.70 --> 2950.02]  We reach out
[2950.02 --> 2950.62]  to our neighbors.
[2951.42 --> 2951.66]  Right?
[2951.66 --> 2953.94]  We share the gospel
[2953.94 --> 2954.46]  with them.
[2954.72 --> 2955.46]  We invite them
[2955.46 --> 2956.80]  to join our church community
[2956.80 --> 2958.04]  to experience God
[2958.04 --> 2958.72]  among us.
[2959.24 --> 2959.92]  It leads us
[2959.92 --> 2960.86]  to share the gospel.
[2961.40 --> 2961.90]  It leads us
[2961.90 --> 2962.88]  to pursue justice
[2962.88 --> 2963.44]  and equity
[2963.44 --> 2965.00]  for all of God's image bearers,
[2965.30 --> 2966.40]  to seek reconciliation
[2966.40 --> 2967.72]  wherever there is
[2967.72 --> 2968.96]  racial injustice
[2968.96 --> 2970.68]  and where races
[2970.68 --> 2971.84]  need to be reconciled.
[2972.34 --> 2973.16]  As God's people,
[2973.46 --> 2974.66]  we take God's will
[2974.66 --> 2975.94]  in heaven
[2975.94 --> 2977.08]  and we pray it on earth.
[2977.96 --> 2979.28]  And as we pray it on earth,
[2979.28 --> 2979.88]  we ask God
[2979.88 --> 2981.06]  to shape our desires
[2981.06 --> 2983.76]  and to get into action.
[2984.88 --> 2986.22]  So I heard this illustration.
[2986.46 --> 2987.44]  If you want God's will
[2987.44 --> 2988.24]  done on earth,
[2989.26 --> 2990.96]  draw a circle on the ground.
[2992.20 --> 2993.32]  Stand in the circle.
[2994.50 --> 2995.56]  Pray for God's will
[2995.56 --> 2996.96]  to come in the circle.
[2997.94 --> 2998.26]  Right?
[2998.30 --> 2998.98]  And when the Father
[2998.98 --> 3000.02]  brings his will
[3000.02 --> 3000.80]  to the circle,
[3001.12 --> 3002.40]  he will bring then
[3002.40 --> 3003.08]  his will
[3003.08 --> 3004.24]  to the rest of the world.
[3005.28 --> 3005.48]  Right?
[3005.52 --> 3006.14]  And the point is
[3006.14 --> 3006.78]  God's will
[3006.78 --> 3008.22]  starts with you and me.
[3008.22 --> 3009.82]  We pray for God's will
[3009.82 --> 3010.26]  to be done
[3010.26 --> 3011.24]  in our hearts,
[3011.68 --> 3012.66]  that God would change
[3012.66 --> 3013.32]  our hearts,
[3013.66 --> 3014.26]  that then we would
[3014.26 --> 3015.34]  reflect him in the world.
[3016.44 --> 3017.54]  So first we pray
[3017.54 --> 3019.64]  for God's will here.
[3020.14 --> 3021.04]  Your will be done
[3021.04 --> 3021.98]  in the circle.
[3024.38 --> 3025.60]  Would your will be done
[3025.60 --> 3026.48]  just right here, God,
[3027.08 --> 3027.86]  in my heart,
[3028.02 --> 3028.84]  in my life.
[3029.44 --> 3030.34]  And when the Spirit,
[3030.72 --> 3032.08]  if we all do this,
[3033.20 --> 3034.90]  if we all of us pray
[3034.90 --> 3035.56]  for God's will
[3035.56 --> 3035.86]  to be done
[3035.86 --> 3036.74]  in our lives,
[3036.74 --> 3038.84]  then what happens
[3038.84 --> 3039.42]  is the Spirit
[3039.42 --> 3040.08]  starts to work
[3040.08 --> 3040.64]  in the church
[3040.64 --> 3042.42]  and then his purposes
[3042.42 --> 3043.66]  and his pleasure
[3043.66 --> 3045.66]  will start to come
[3045.66 --> 3046.80]  to the world.
[3049.04 --> 3050.08]  And so to close,
[3050.88 --> 3051.96]  there's another story
[3051.96 --> 3053.04]  in the Gospels
[3053.04 --> 3054.76]  about God's will,
[3055.12 --> 3056.04]  but this time
[3056.04 --> 3057.34]  we see God's purposes
[3057.34 --> 3058.72]  and God's pleasure
[3058.72 --> 3059.88]  come together
[3059.88 --> 3061.28]  in harmony,
[3061.88 --> 3063.26]  perfectly aligned.
[3063.26 --> 3065.08]  and that is the story
[3065.08 --> 3065.90]  of Jesus praying
[3065.90 --> 3067.22]  in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[3067.62 --> 3069.08]  That is in Matthew 26.
[3069.90 --> 3071.50]  So Jesus is nearing
[3071.50 --> 3072.58]  the end of his life
[3072.58 --> 3073.02]  on earth.
[3073.42 --> 3074.82]  He's praying to his Father
[3074.82 --> 3075.28]  in heaven
[3075.28 --> 3076.72]  and while he was praying,
[3076.80 --> 3077.82]  it says he was sweating
[3077.82 --> 3079.18]  blood from his pores.
[3079.64 --> 3081.96]  He was so sorrowful,
[3082.06 --> 3083.28]  he was so troubled
[3083.28 --> 3084.84]  that he felt like
[3084.84 --> 3085.90]  he was dying.
[3086.14 --> 3086.66]  He was beginning
[3086.66 --> 3087.58]  to experience
[3087.58 --> 3088.56]  in that moment
[3088.56 --> 3089.38]  what he was going
[3089.38 --> 3089.96]  to experience
[3089.96 --> 3090.54]  on the cross.
[3090.88 --> 3091.54]  He was praying
[3091.54 --> 3093.06]  through this immense agony.
[3094.08 --> 3095.08]  And as a son
[3095.08 --> 3096.60]  who is coming
[3096.60 --> 3098.54]  to his Father
[3098.54 --> 3099.90]  in desperation,
[3100.32 --> 3101.26]  just like the leper,
[3102.26 --> 3103.24]  he comes to Jesus,
[3103.72 --> 3105.02]  Jesus comes to the Father,
[3105.42 --> 3106.12]  he prays,
[3106.44 --> 3106.74]  Father,
[3106.90 --> 3108.34]  if it is possible,
[3108.64 --> 3109.56]  may this cup
[3109.56 --> 3110.66]  be taken from me.
[3111.98 --> 3113.42]  If you will, God,
[3113.48 --> 3114.12]  you can do it.
[3115.48 --> 3116.32]  And what is the cup?
[3116.90 --> 3118.20]  The cup is referring
[3118.20 --> 3119.16]  to the judgment
[3119.16 --> 3120.06]  that he is about
[3120.06 --> 3120.66]  to undergo.
[3120.66 --> 3122.52]  The cup is the punishment
[3122.52 --> 3123.94]  for the cosmic weight
[3123.94 --> 3125.10]  of sin.
[3125.78 --> 3126.60]  It's the punishment
[3126.60 --> 3127.36]  we deserve
[3127.36 --> 3128.62]  for every time
[3128.62 --> 3130.40]  we disobey God's will.
[3132.08 --> 3133.48]  Jesus prays,
[3134.12 --> 3134.72]  my Father,
[3134.88 --> 3135.82]  if it is possible,
[3136.38 --> 3137.50]  may this cup
[3137.50 --> 3139.50]  be taken from me.
[3140.48 --> 3140.72]  Right?
[3140.78 --> 3141.84]  In terms of Jesus'
[3142.14 --> 3143.30]  human nature,
[3144.16 --> 3144.74]  he's saying,
[3144.84 --> 3145.12]  Father,
[3145.28 --> 3146.28]  are you willing
[3146.28 --> 3147.24]  that I don't have
[3147.24 --> 3147.82]  to do this?
[3147.82 --> 3149.58]  I'm starting to feel
[3149.58 --> 3150.60]  and experience
[3150.60 --> 3151.72]  just how crazy
[3151.72 --> 3152.82]  and weighty
[3152.82 --> 3154.18]  this is actually
[3154.18 --> 3154.76]  going to be.
[3155.66 --> 3155.88]  Right?
[3155.98 --> 3156.90]  The punishment
[3156.90 --> 3157.82]  for sin
[3157.82 --> 3159.32]  is tremendous.
[3160.94 --> 3161.42]  Father,
[3161.56 --> 3162.80]  get me out of this.
[3164.36 --> 3165.70]  But then he prays,
[3166.42 --> 3166.80]  yet,
[3167.26 --> 3169.20]  yet,
[3169.72 --> 3171.04]  not as I will,
[3171.72 --> 3172.84]  but as you will.
[3172.84 --> 3175.04]  So what's he saying?
[3175.82 --> 3176.50]  He's saying,
[3176.88 --> 3177.06]  Father,
[3177.16 --> 3178.00]  not my plan,
[3178.50 --> 3179.76]  not my purpose,
[3180.32 --> 3180.84]  but Father,
[3181.16 --> 3182.14]  your plan,
[3182.94 --> 3183.76]  your purpose
[3183.76 --> 3184.22]  be done.
[3185.50 --> 3185.72]  Right?
[3185.78 --> 3186.86]  He's not just shrugging
[3186.86 --> 3187.52]  his shoulders saying,
[3187.62 --> 3187.90]  well, God,
[3187.94 --> 3188.38]  you're just going to do
[3188.38 --> 3189.78]  whatever you're going to do.
[3190.70 --> 3191.16]  No,
[3191.28 --> 3191.54]  he's,
[3192.24 --> 3192.66]  he's,
[3192.74 --> 3193.50]  it's a prayer,
[3194.38 --> 3195.42]  as N.T. Wright said,
[3195.42 --> 3196.30]  of submission
[3196.30 --> 3197.54]  and commission
[3197.54 --> 3200.18]  so that the Father's plan
[3200.18 --> 3201.26]  and his purposes
[3201.26 --> 3203.12]  would be fulfilled
[3203.12 --> 3204.22]  in Jesus' life.
[3205.54 --> 3206.72]  And what is the plan
[3206.72 --> 3207.84]  and purpose of God?
[3208.30 --> 3209.10]  It's that you
[3209.10 --> 3209.76]  and I
[3209.76 --> 3210.82]  might be redeemed
[3210.82 --> 3211.78]  and adopted
[3211.78 --> 3213.38]  into the family of God.
[3214.54 --> 3214.70]  Right?
[3214.80 --> 3215.72]  God's will,
[3216.00 --> 3216.88]  for God's will
[3216.88 --> 3217.76]  to be done on earth
[3217.76 --> 3218.56]  as is in heaven,
[3218.70 --> 3219.84]  means that Jesus
[3219.84 --> 3221.16]  came into our world,
[3221.16 --> 3223.00]  he bore the way
[3223.00 --> 3223.80]  of our sin
[3223.80 --> 3226.04]  to redeem us.
[3227.80 --> 3228.98]  And in Jesus Christ,
[3229.48 --> 3230.32]  God's purposes
[3230.32 --> 3231.08]  and God's will
[3231.08 --> 3232.04]  are not in conflict.
[3232.92 --> 3233.88]  Because fulfilling
[3233.88 --> 3235.02]  the Father's plan
[3235.02 --> 3235.92]  is the pleasure
[3235.92 --> 3236.42]  of Jesus.
[3237.00 --> 3237.80]  Because not only
[3237.80 --> 3239.32]  is Jesus fully,
[3239.42 --> 3239.54]  man,
[3239.58 --> 3240.50]  he's also fully God.
[3240.58 --> 3242.10]  Whatever the Father wills
[3242.10 --> 3243.66]  is his will as well.
[3244.96 --> 3245.80]  Jesus and the Father
[3245.80 --> 3247.04]  plan from all eternity,
[3247.14 --> 3247.76]  this is the covenant
[3247.76 --> 3248.38]  of redemption
[3248.38 --> 3249.06]  that they,
[3249.42 --> 3250.30]  that he would come
[3250.30 --> 3251.08]  to accomplish
[3251.08 --> 3251.70]  the Father's will
[3251.70 --> 3252.02]  on earth
[3252.02 --> 3252.80]  and redeeming
[3252.80 --> 3253.26]  his people.
[3254.70 --> 3255.54]  Hebrews says,
[3255.64 --> 3256.26]  for the joy
[3256.26 --> 3257.16]  set before him,
[3257.24 --> 3258.36]  Jesus endured the cross.
[3259.28 --> 3260.40]  What was that joy?
[3260.54 --> 3261.10]  That joy
[3261.10 --> 3262.50]  was to accomplish
[3262.50 --> 3263.42]  the Father's will
[3263.42 --> 3265.04]  of bringing us
[3265.04 --> 3266.16]  into a relationship
[3266.16 --> 3266.74]  with him.
[3267.54 --> 3268.72]  And then to renew us,
[3268.80 --> 3269.74]  renew our hearts
[3269.74 --> 3270.50]  and change us
[3270.50 --> 3271.88]  so that we then
[3271.88 --> 3273.20]  seek God's pleasure,
[3273.32 --> 3274.54]  his perfect and pleasing
[3274.54 --> 3275.74]  and perfect will
[3275.74 --> 3278.26]  that Ephesians talked about,
[3278.54 --> 3279.32]  that it would then
[3279.32 --> 3280.94]  become our purpose.
[3281.08 --> 3283.32]  and our pleasure
[3283.32 --> 3284.80]  as his children.
[3286.02 --> 3287.18]  So that's what we pray.
[3287.42 --> 3288.26]  Your will be done.
[3289.24 --> 3290.02]  Thanks be to God.
[3290.48 --> 3291.24]  Let's pray together.
[3296.02 --> 3296.62]  Father,
[3296.74 --> 3297.30]  this is a
[3297.30 --> 3299.14]  very dangerous prayer.
[3299.14 --> 3299.76]  Lord,
[3299.76 --> 3304.38]  it is dangerous for us
[3304.38 --> 3306.34]  to pray this
[3306.34 --> 3308.46]  because not only,
[3308.68 --> 3308.80]  Lord,
[3308.86 --> 3310.52]  is it a hope
[3310.52 --> 3312.04]  that you will accomplish
[3312.04 --> 3313.36]  all of your holy will,
[3313.44 --> 3313.74]  but Lord,
[3313.82 --> 3314.12]  it is,
[3314.60 --> 3315.26]  it comes to us
[3315.26 --> 3316.00]  as a challenge
[3316.00 --> 3318.64]  because we're praying,
[3318.76 --> 3318.90]  Lord,
[3318.98 --> 3320.48]  would you accomplish
[3320.48 --> 3322.02]  your will in us?
[3323.02 --> 3323.92]  Would you accomplish
[3323.92 --> 3325.64]  your will through us
[3325.64 --> 3327.18]  as your people?
[3327.70 --> 3328.28]  So Lord,
[3328.36 --> 3329.58]  we pray for your help
[3329.58 --> 3330.42]  by your Holy Spirit.
[3331.22 --> 3332.10]  Would your will
[3332.10 --> 3333.76]  come to each circle
[3333.76 --> 3336.18]  that represents
[3336.18 --> 3337.22]  our hearts
[3337.22 --> 3339.06]  so that we would
[3339.06 --> 3341.06]  obey and submit
[3341.06 --> 3341.88]  to your will
[3341.88 --> 3343.24]  in our lives?
[3343.24 --> 3344.28]  all that you call us
[3344.28 --> 3344.60]  to do,
[3344.70 --> 3345.66]  all that you call us
[3345.66 --> 3346.08]  to be,
[3346.42 --> 3346.56]  Lord,
[3346.64 --> 3347.38]  would you have
[3347.38 --> 3348.34]  your will done
[3348.34 --> 3348.86]  in us?
[3349.70 --> 3350.32]  And then all that
[3350.32 --> 3351.76]  you want to accomplish
[3351.76 --> 3352.98]  and do in this world
[3352.98 --> 3354.28]  would through us,
[3354.34 --> 3355.10]  your Holy Spirit,
[3355.58 --> 3356.94]  work in your church
[3356.94 --> 3359.20]  and bring revival
[3359.20 --> 3360.96]  to this world.
[3361.78 --> 3363.78]  We pray in your holy name.
[3364.20 --> 3364.44]  Amen.
[3366.22 --> 3367.22]  So let's stand.
[3367.34 --> 3367.94]  Let's sing
[3367.94 --> 3368.94]  our song of response
[3368.94 --> 3370.20]  when we walk
[3370.20 --> 3370.72]  with the Lord.
[3370.92 --> 3372.00]  Let's sing together.
[3373.24 --> 3375.24]  Amen.
[3403.24 --> 3409.22]  When we walk
[3409.22 --> 3411.66]  with the Lord
[3411.66 --> 3413.16]  in the light
[3413.16 --> 3415.54]  of His word,
[3416.00 --> 3417.48]  what a glory
[3417.48 --> 3419.12]  He sheds
[3419.12 --> 3421.24]  on our way.
[3423.32 --> 3424.80]  While He'll do
[3424.80 --> 3426.24]  His good will,
[3426.24 --> 3428.70]  He abides
[3428.70 --> 3430.24]  with us still
[3430.24 --> 3432.82]  and with all
[3432.82 --> 3434.66]  who will trust
[3434.66 --> 3436.66]  and obey.
[3436.66 --> 3438.66]  Trust
[3438.66 --> 3440.66]  and obey
[3440.66 --> 3442.66]  for there's
[3442.66 --> 3444.66]  no other way
[3445.66 --> 3447.66]  to be happy
[3447.66 --> 3449.66]  in Jesus
[3449.66 --> 3452.08]  but to trust
[3452.08 --> 3454.08]  and obey.
[3454.08 --> 3459.08]  But we never
[3459.08 --> 3462.14]  can prove
[3462.14 --> 3463.08]  the delights
[3463.72 --> 3466.08]  of His love
[3466.08 --> 3467.92]  until all
[3467.92 --> 3470.02]  on the altar
[3470.02 --> 3471.70]  we lay.
[3471.70 --> 3475.12]  for the favor
[3475.12 --> 3479.12]  and the joy
[3479.12 --> 3479.62]  and the joy
[3479.62 --> 3482.12]  He bestows
[3482.12 --> 3483.96]  are for those
[3483.96 --> 3485.70]  who will trust
[3485.70 --> 3487.62]  and obey.
[3489.62 --> 3490.36]  Trust
[3490.36 --> 3492.18]  and obey
[3492.18 --> 3494.04]  for there's
[3494.04 --> 3497.10]  no other way
[3497.10 --> 3498.60]  to be happy
[3498.60 --> 3500.60]  in Jesus
[3500.60 --> 3504.40]  but to trust
[3504.40 --> 3506.60]  and obey.
[3506.60 --> 3512.02]  then in fellowship
[3512.02 --> 3513.94]  sweet
[3513.94 --> 3515.10]  we will
[3515.10 --> 3518.30]  sit at His feet
[3518.30 --> 3520.08]  or we'll walk
[3520.08 --> 3521.96]  by His side
[3521.96 --> 3524.02]  in the way.
[3525.60 --> 3527.76]  What He says
[3527.76 --> 3530.10]  we will do
[3530.10 --> 3531.72]  where He stands
[3531.72 --> 3534.22]  we will go
[3534.22 --> 3535.92]  never fear
[3535.92 --> 3536.80]  only
[3536.80 --> 3537.72]  trust
[3537.72 --> 3539.56]  and obey
[3539.56 --> 3542.30]  trust
[3542.30 --> 3543.88]  and obey
[3543.88 --> 3545.96]  for there's
[3545.96 --> 3549.18]  no other way
[3549.18 --> 3551.06]  to be happy
[3551.06 --> 3553.52]  in Jesus
[3553.52 --> 3556.72]  but to trust
[3556.72 --> 3559.06]  and obey.
[3564.22 --> 3578.64]  please join me
[3578.64 --> 3579.18]  in prayer.
[3584.92 --> 3586.20]  O great God
[3586.20 --> 3587.98]  glorify Yourself
[3587.98 --> 3589.10]  in all the earth
[3589.10 --> 3590.86]  be glorified
[3590.86 --> 3591.56]  in creation
[3591.56 --> 3593.42]  be glorified
[3593.42 --> 3594.60]  in Your church
[3594.60 --> 3596.18]  be glorified
[3596.18 --> 3596.86]  in our worship
[3596.86 --> 3598.24]  here this very morning.
[3599.28 --> 3600.26]  Though we are
[3600.26 --> 3600.96]  so small
[3600.96 --> 3602.22]  and You are so grand
[3602.22 --> 3603.10]  help us
[3603.10 --> 3603.88]  nevertheless
[3603.88 --> 3605.26]  to magnify
[3605.26 --> 3606.08]  Your name.
[3606.96 --> 3607.78]  Help us
[3607.78 --> 3608.78]  to make Your name
[3608.78 --> 3609.46]  and the nature
[3609.46 --> 3610.28]  of Your grace
[3610.28 --> 3610.80]  larger
[3610.80 --> 3612.00]  and easier
[3612.00 --> 3612.96]  for people to see.
[3613.92 --> 3615.12]  Help us to live
[3615.12 --> 3615.74]  and to worship
[3615.74 --> 3616.68]  in such a way
[3616.68 --> 3617.74]  that we become
[3617.74 --> 3619.06]  like magnifying glasses
[3619.06 --> 3619.96]  through which our neighbors
[3619.96 --> 3621.26]  and coworkers
[3621.26 --> 3622.54]  and children
[3622.54 --> 3623.22]  and friends
[3623.22 --> 3624.40]  can see You
[3624.40 --> 3625.44]  come into focus
[3625.44 --> 3626.32]  in ways
[3626.32 --> 3626.96]  they may not
[3626.96 --> 3627.78]  have seen before.
[3629.48 --> 3630.70]  When people ask
[3630.70 --> 3631.48]  for an explanation
[3631.48 --> 3632.48]  of the hope we have
[3632.48 --> 3634.10]  give us the words
[3634.10 --> 3635.30]  to answer thoughtfully
[3635.30 --> 3636.44]  and well.
[3637.38 --> 3638.54]  When people wonder
[3638.54 --> 3639.28]  out loud
[3639.28 --> 3640.48]  who Jesus is
[3640.48 --> 3642.06]  and why He matters
[3642.06 --> 3643.50]  help us to reply
[3643.50 --> 3643.98]  in words
[3643.98 --> 3644.72]  that will echo
[3644.72 --> 3645.60]  the sweetness
[3645.60 --> 3646.36]  of Your gospel.
[3647.28 --> 3648.66]  Help us to magnify
[3648.66 --> 3649.54]  Your name O Lord
[3649.54 --> 3650.80]  so that You may be
[3650.80 --> 3652.44]  glorified in all the earth.
[3653.84 --> 3654.98]  And bless the leadership
[3654.98 --> 3656.34]  of our congregation.
[3657.24 --> 3657.72]  Anoint them
[3657.72 --> 3658.70]  by Your Spirit
[3658.70 --> 3659.40]  and may they
[3659.40 --> 3660.48]  really feel
[3660.48 --> 3661.58]  that anointing.
[3662.06 --> 3662.94]  As they sometimes
[3662.94 --> 3663.64]  do difficult
[3663.64 --> 3665.06]  sometimes joyful
[3665.06 --> 3666.84]  but always holy work
[3666.84 --> 3668.22]  may they sense
[3668.22 --> 3669.38]  Your anointing.
[3670.30 --> 3670.96]  Be in the words
[3670.96 --> 3671.64]  they speak
[3671.64 --> 3673.02]  the cards they send
[3673.02 --> 3674.44]  the visits they make
[3674.44 --> 3675.74]  be in the meetings
[3675.74 --> 3676.58]  they attend
[3676.58 --> 3677.24]  and the committees
[3677.24 --> 3677.98]  they work on.
[3679.12 --> 3680.02]  And as they
[3680.02 --> 3681.02]  and each of us
[3681.02 --> 3682.30]  consider nominations
[3682.30 --> 3683.46]  for our next council
[3683.46 --> 3685.22]  may a new leadership
[3685.22 --> 3686.32]  group be formed
[3686.32 --> 3687.70]  that can carry on
[3687.70 --> 3688.52]  Your kingdom work.
[3689.64 --> 3690.32]  Make each of us
[3690.32 --> 3691.04]  in this congregation
[3691.04 --> 3691.96]  a bearer of
[3691.96 --> 3692.78]  Pentecost flame
[3692.78 --> 3694.34]  warming hearts
[3694.34 --> 3695.80]  providing hope
[3695.80 --> 3697.44]  lending comfort
[3697.44 --> 3699.60]  and so in all these ways
[3699.60 --> 3700.42]  contributing
[3700.42 --> 3701.62]  to Your glory.
[3701.62 --> 3704.86]  We pray for patience
[3704.86 --> 3705.64]  and grace
[3705.64 --> 3706.86]  as we hear more
[3706.86 --> 3707.56]  and more news
[3707.56 --> 3708.36]  of protests
[3708.36 --> 3709.88]  and counter-protests
[3709.88 --> 3711.96]  over max vaccine mandates
[3711.96 --> 3713.06]  and other initiatives
[3713.06 --> 3714.46]  driven by the pandemic.
[3714.98 --> 3716.60]  We pray for wise decisions
[3716.60 --> 3718.28]  from local, national
[3718.28 --> 3719.30]  and world leadership
[3719.30 --> 3721.28]  as they consider next steps
[3721.28 --> 3722.62]  and how best to limit
[3722.62 --> 3723.96]  the spread of COVID
[3723.96 --> 3725.40]  while still respecting
[3725.40 --> 3726.98]  people's individual choices.
[3728.88 --> 3730.26]  We pray for healing
[3730.26 --> 3731.66]  for those battling illness
[3731.66 --> 3732.62]  within our congregation
[3732.62 --> 3734.72]  and we hold up before You
[3734.72 --> 3736.76]  Katrine Geronimus
[3736.76 --> 3738.30]  Joan Bauman
[3738.30 --> 3739.36]  Doug Anderson
[3739.36 --> 3740.40]  and many others
[3740.40 --> 3741.44]  and we just pray
[3741.44 --> 3742.18]  for Your grace
[3742.18 --> 3742.88]  to be on them.
[3743.62 --> 3744.32]  May they each
[3744.32 --> 3745.48]  feel Your presence
[3745.48 --> 3747.06]  and may they also
[3747.06 --> 3748.20]  feel the prayers
[3748.20 --> 3749.22]  of this congregation
[3749.22 --> 3750.44]  throughout the week.
[3751.42 --> 3752.78]  We pray for Your blessings
[3752.78 --> 3753.76]  on the Johnsons
[3753.76 --> 3755.02]  and on their work
[3755.02 --> 3755.90]  with North American
[3755.90 --> 3757.30]  Indigenous Ministries.
[3758.00 --> 3758.90]  May their efforts
[3758.90 --> 3759.88]  to glorify You
[3759.88 --> 3761.08]  by building Your church
[3761.08 --> 3762.76]  among Indigenous communities
[3762.76 --> 3763.78]  bear fruit
[3763.78 --> 3765.64]  and lead to new disciples
[3765.64 --> 3766.30]  for You.
[3767.38 --> 3768.58]  All this we pray
[3768.58 --> 3770.34]  ever and only
[3770.34 --> 3771.52]  in Jesus' name.
[3771.88 --> 3772.10]  Amen.
[3772.10 --> 3788.80]  Please stand.
[3788.80 --> 3794.94]  I invite you to hold out
[3794.94 --> 3795.56]  your hands
[3795.56 --> 3796.36]  as a gesture
[3796.36 --> 3797.74]  receiving the blessing
[3797.74 --> 3799.52]  of Your Heavenly Father.
[3799.52 --> 3802.76]  May the God of peace
[3802.76 --> 3804.46]  who through the blood
[3804.46 --> 3805.56]  of the eternal covenant
[3805.56 --> 3806.86]  brought back from the dead
[3806.86 --> 3808.24]  our Lord Jesus Christ
[3808.24 --> 3809.00]  that great shepherd
[3809.00 --> 3809.68]  of the sheep

[3811.20 --> 3811.88]  with everything
[3811.88 --> 3813.26]  for doing His will
[3813.26 --> 3817.30]  and may He work in us
[3817.30 --> 3819.18]  what is pleasing to Him
[3819.18 --> 3821.32]  through Jesus Christ
[3821.32 --> 3822.10]  to whom be glory
[3822.10 --> 3823.16]  forever and ever.
[3824.00 --> 3824.28]  Amen.
