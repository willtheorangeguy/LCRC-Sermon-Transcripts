• The concept of virtue and its importance in the Christian life
• Four questions: What is virtue? Why does it matter? Why is it so difficult? How do we get it?
• Virtue is described as walking in the light that is God
• The path of virtue leads to a life of goodness, health, and well-being
• The opposite, the path of vice, leads to darkness, selfishness, violence, and suffering
• Virtue is defined as a life of integrity, honesty, loyalty, kindness, peacefulness, and generosity
• Growing in virtue is essential for personal well-being and avoiding shame
• Living a virtuous life means being integrated, consistent, and authentic in behavior and heart
• Virtue matters for one's own well-being, neighbor, and the world
• It is difficult to pursue virtue because of the effects of sin in our hearts and external influences
• Growth in virtue requires more than just motivation or willpower; it involves a change of character
• People often try to take a shortcut by trying to display virtue on the outside without making internal changes.
• Living a virtuous life requires genuine inner change, rather than just outward actions.
• Christian virtue goes beyond mere behavior and requires a transformation of the heart and mind.
• The Bible teaches that true virtue comes from a relationship with God through Jesus Christ, not just from human effort or willpower.
• A common misconception about God is that He judges and evaluates people from a distance, but the biblical story shows that God comes down to humanity in Jesus Christ.
• Virtue is demonstrated through virtuous words and actions, with Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection crediting his virtue to those who cannot do it on their own.
• The invitation from Jesus is to come and be with him, abide in him, and enjoy his presence.
• Growing in virtue comes not from striving but from abiding in Jesus and allowing the Holy Spirit to work in one's life.
• Virtue flows from Jesus into believers through the work of the Holy Spirit, resulting in genuine growth and fruitfulness.
• The key to growing in virtue is enjoying God through Bible study, prayer, worship, and other spiritual practices.
• The song "He Will Hold Me Fast" is sung, emphasizing God's faithfulness and holding power in times of temptation and doubt.
• A prayer is offered for guidance, blessing, and mercy in the new year, asking God to shape their vision, teach them through His Spirit, and prepare their bodies and minds for the challenges ahead.
• The congregation prays for the Lord's provision, strength, health, clarity, creativity, and discernment as they face various circumstances in the coming year.
• They ask that their words, choices, and actions be expressions of worship and that they not waste a moment in the days ahead.
