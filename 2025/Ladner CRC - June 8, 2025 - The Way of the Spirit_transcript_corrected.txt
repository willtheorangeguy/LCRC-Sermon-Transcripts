[1559.62 → 1589.60] Thank you.
[1589.60 → 1619.60] So,
[1619.60 → 1649.58] this verse,
[1649.58 → 1679.56] this cup is the
[1679.56 → 1709.56] here.
[1709.56 → 1739.56] Thank you.
[1739.56 → 1744.42] elements this morning, let's confess our faith together with the words of the Heidelberg Catechism,
[1744.64 → 1749.90] question and answer 53. This is all about the Holy Spirit. So let's say this together. Well,
[1749.96 → 1757.78] the question, what do you believe concerning the Holy Spirit? Let's answer together. First,
[1757.78 → 1767.02] that the Spirit with the Father and the Son is eternal God. Second, that the Spirit is given
[1767.02 → 1775.26] also to me, so that through true faith, He makes me share in Christ and all His benefits,
[1775.90 → 1782.40] comforts me, and will remain with me forever. Let's pray together.
[1785.08 → 1791.70] God, our Father, maker of heaven and earth, maker of all things visible and invisible,
[1791.70 → 1800.46] would you set apart these visible elements of bread and cup from their common use to a holy use,
[1800.72 → 1809.46] pointing to our participation in your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus, it is by your broken body
[1809.46 → 1817.84] and your shed blood that we are no longer under the law, but belong to you. Holy Spirit,
[1817.84 → 1826.50] thank you for bringing us into the very life of God. Would you seat us now with Christ in the heavenly
[1826.50 → 1833.28] places that we might feast with Him and that we might feast on Him by faith? Lord, would you bless
[1833.28 → 1841.82] this meal? We pray in Christ's name. Amen. So friends, the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed,
[1841.82 → 1847.56] He took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and He said, this is my body, which is for you.
[1848.30 → 1854.84] Do this in remembrance of me. The same way, after supper, He took the cup, saying, this cup is the new
[1854.84 → 1862.78] covenant in my blood. Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me. And then Jesus said,
[1862.78 → 1872.92] for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do so proclaiming the Lord's death until He comes
[1872.92 → 1880.42] again. So let's say our communion liturgy together this morning. Brothers and sisters, lift your
[1880.42 → 1889.26] hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. We are His people. Furthermore, we are redeemed by His grace. Let us proclaim the
[1889.26 → 1898.98] mystery of faith. Christ has died. Christ is risen. Christ will come again. Christ, our Passover, has been
[1898.98 → 1907.60] sacrificed for us. Hallelujah. These are the gifts of God for you as people. Take them and feed on Him
[1907.60 → 1916.96] by faith with great Thanksgiving, knowing and trusting and believing that Christ died for you. May I invite
[1916.96 → 1924.54] our elders now to come forward, and we will distribute the elements. And for all of you, this is a time for
[1924.54 → 1929.96] you to just simply meditate on what Christ has done for you on the cross and His death, His resurrection,
[1929.96 → 1930.76] to give you life.
[1946.96 → 1948.44] Christ has.
[1948.64 → 1951.48] Christ has fallen carefully, and this is the time for you to begin with. And for some of you to come
[1951.48 → 1956.96] if God teaches you the very second wise, you fall down in order and pray for you,
[1957.40 → 1965.50] upon him. And that is once you give God a round oasis, to chew your heart. And so I think is part of it,
[1965.50 → 1974.90] but I love you who has an excellent Please in scripture as Standard & よので во last chapter

[2381.92 → 2385.92] Lord, you have seated us at your banquet table.
[2385.92 → 2398.04] And Lord, it's a picture of the heavenly banquet which we will one day enjoy with you when we sit with you face to face in your eternal kingdom.

[2474.04 → 2475.04] Good morning, everybody.
[2475.04 → 2476.04] Good morning.
[2476.04 → 2477.04] Good morning.
[2477.04 → 2478.04] Good morning.
[2478.04 → 2479.04] Good morning.
[2479.04 → 2480.04] Good morning.
[2480.04 → 2482.04] Good morning, sounds we are so we are proud to have you throughout the consultation.
[2482.04 → 2486.04] Is that a hand up? Yeah? Okay, come up here.
[2486.04 → 2490.04] Come on. So what I'd like you to do
[2490.04 → 2494.04] is first, Serena, I'd like you to pick this bag up, and I'd just
[2494.04 → 2498.04] like you to walk over there. It'll be your turn in a minute. Walk over there and then walk back.
[2498.04 → 2502.04] Okay, come back, come back, come back. That's too far.
[2502.04 → 2506.04] Come back here. Okay, what do you think? How'd that bag feel?
[2506.04 → 2508.04] Like?
[2508.04 → 2510.04] We didn't rehearse this ahead of time.
[2510.04 → 2514.04] We didn't rehearse this ahead of time. You're supposed to say heavy.
[2514.04 → 2518.04] You're very strong, I know. How about you? You try it. Watch out.
[2518.04 → 2522.04] Okay. Alright, come back, come back. Oh, yeah.
[2522.04 → 2526.04] What do you think? Heavy. Now, so this is a heavy
[2526.04 → 2530.04] burden. Some of the times we're strong, but you probably couldn't carry this for very
[2530.04 → 2534.04] far without getting too tired. But now what I want you to try
[2534.04 → 2538.04] is I want you to both take a handle and I want you to gather,
[2538.04 → 2542.04] lift it and walk over. Okay, not too fast. Okay,
[2542.04 → 2546.04] come back. What do you think? Was that easier?
[2546.04 → 2550.04] Yes, yes. Okay. Yeah.
[2550.04 → 2554.04] Right? It was a little bit easier. You know why? Because we're both
[2554.04 → 2558.04] carrying it, and we're helping each other, right? Right? Yeah, we can both carry it.
[2558.04 → 2562.04] So sometimes if you have a heavy bag of groceries, you can both hold a handle and
[2562.04 → 2566.04] you can carry it. Or you have heavy things, you can carry it together. Right? Okay.
[2566.04 → 2568.04] Thank you. You can sit down.
[2568.04 → 2572.04] So, I have one verse from the Bible to share with you.
[2572.04 → 2574.04] This is from the letter to the Galatians.
[2574.04 → 2576.04] Galatians chapter 6 verse 2.
[2576.04 → 2584.04] Paul says this, carry each other's burdens and in this way you fulfill the law of Christ.
[2584.04 → 2586.04] Can everyone say it together? Repeat after me.
[2586.04 → 2594.04] Wait, what does it say? Carry each other's burdens. Carry each other's burdens.
[2594.04 → 2602.04] And in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[2602.04 → 2606.04] Okay, what is the law of Christ?
[2606.04 → 2610.04] Remember? It's to love one another.
[2610.04 → 2614.04] Right? In the Gospel of John, Jesus said this is a new command I give to you, that you must love one another.
[2614.04 → 2620.04] And one of the ways we can love one another is by helping carry each other's burdens.
[2620.04 → 2625.04] Now that doesn't mean we're always carrying a heavy bag, but sometimes in our hearts we carry heavy burdens too, right?
[2625.04 → 2630.04] Whether it's sin or we're suffering, feeling sad in some way.
[2630.04 → 2634.04] So how can we help each other carry those burdens?
[2634.04 → 2637.04] Go ahead.
[2637.04 → 2639.04] Cheer them up.
[2639.04 → 2641.04] And help them, yeah.
[2641.04 → 2643.04] Do you have one?
[2643.04 → 2645.04] No? Yeah.
[2645.04 → 2647.04] And so sometimes you can't tell people have a burden.
[2647.04 → 2649.04] So what do we need to do first?
[2649.04 → 2651.04] We need to look.
[2651.04 → 2653.04] And we need to listen, right?
[2653.04 → 2654.04] We need to notice people.
[2654.04 → 2656.04] And wonder, are they feeling sad?
[2656.04 → 2657.04] Do they need help?
[2657.04 → 2659.04] Then we can encourage them.
[2659.04 → 2660.04] And we can help them.
[2660.04 → 2661.04] And we can pray for them.
[2661.04 → 2662.04] Okay?
[2662.04 → 2667.04] So now you all are going to go do a fun activity where you're going to have a chance to help each other.
[2667.04 → 2668.04] Okay?
[2668.04 → 2670.04] That's what we're going to do in Sunday school today.
[2670.04 → 2672.04] So let me pray for us.
[2672.04 → 2673.04] And then we can, I'll send you off.
[2673.04 → 2674.04] Ready?
[2674.04 → 2681.04] Father God, would you help us to fulfill the law of Christ by carrying one another's burdens.
[2681.04 → 2683.04] And in this way, love one another.
[2683.04 → 2685.04] Help each of us, Lord, by your spirit.
[2685.04 → 2686.04] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2686.04 → 2687.04] Amen.
[2687.04 → 2688.04] All right.
[2688.04 → 2689.04] Thanks for joining me.
[2689.04 → 2690.04] You can go to your class.
[2690.04 → 2691.04] See you later.
[2691.04 → 2698.04] And so our Chinese brothers and sisters are dismissed to also go to their service.
[2698.04 → 2721.04] thank you for healing vista and hear your insight on my neck and Era at
[2721.04 → 2723.04] any times .....
[2723.04 → 2732.70] Good morning again.
[2734.40 → 2735.92] And so, thank you.
[2736.50 → 2740.34] Many of you will know, but if you haven't been with us, you might not,
[2740.64 → 2744.10] that we are in the midst of a sermon series in the book of Romans.
[2744.72 → 2747.60] And today we come to Romans chapter 7.
[2747.96 → 2748.98] Okay, Romans chapter 7.
[2748.98 → 2752.02] I invite you to, if you'd like to follow along in your pew Bible,
[2752.02 → 2753.98] you may open to Romans 7.
[2754.10 → 2755.02] I'll read from there.
[2756.86 → 2758.68] But the words will be on the screen as well.
[2762.44 → 2764.30] That's on page 840.
[2765.82 → 2766.30] 840.
[2768.56 → 2770.32] And summer has arrived.
[2770.48 → 2771.88] It's getting a little warm, right?
[2772.96 → 2773.62] Is everyone okay?
[2775.00 → 2775.48] Hot?
[2776.42 → 2778.02] Why don't we open this door?
[2778.02 → 2780.68] Well, thanks, Bill.
[2780.98 → 2781.16] Okay.
[2782.02 → 2787.04] I think with fewer people, it'll start to air out or cool off a bit.
[2787.48 → 2790.16] Okay, so Romans chapter 7.
[2790.90 → 2793.64] And we'll read verses 1 through 6.
[2794.68 → 2797.14] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2797.14 → 2809.08] Do you not know, brothers, for I am speaking to men who know the law, that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives.
[2809.08 → 2816.00] For example, by law, a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive.
[2816.00 → 2820.50] But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.
[2820.50 → 2826.76] So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress.
[2826.76 → 2833.06] But if her husband dies, she is released from the law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.
[2833.06 → 2845.68] So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.
[2845.68 → 2855.30] For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.
[2855.90 → 2866.48] But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law, so that we serve in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the written code.
[2867.14 → 2868.36] This is the word of the Lord.
[2870.46 → 2874.52] Let's ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[2875.68 → 2882.90] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[2884.58 → 2896.08] We pray now, Lord, that you would hold out Jesus to us again, that he would be our life, and that we would treasure him above everything else,
[2896.62 → 2901.22] and that your Holy Spirit might pour his love into our hearts this morning.
[2902.06 → 2904.32] We ask this in his name. Amen.
[2905.68 → 2907.66] So we're starting a new chapter.
[2908.14 → 2909.28] Chapter 6.
[2910.18 → 2915.58] In chapter 6 of Romans, Paul has just told us a bunch of amazing things.
[2916.16 → 2921.34] He said that if you are a Christian, you are united to Christ.
[2921.50 → 2921.70] Okay?
[2922.04 → 2922.90] United to Christ.
[2922.94 → 2926.58] That's one of the main key phrases that Paul uses over and over.
[2927.32 → 2928.30] Our union with Christ.
[2928.38 → 2932.66] We're united to him in his death, and we're united to him in his resurrection.
[2932.66 → 2938.86] So you have died to sin in Jesus Christ, and therefore sin is no longer your master.
[2939.30 → 2942.64] You now have a new master who is the Lord Jesus.
[2943.56 → 2951.62] So now we come to chapter 7, and Paul knows we're going to have a question, and there's a question for him to deal with.
[2952.38 → 2953.68] Here is the question.
[2953.68 → 2960.36] If the Christian is now dead to sin and alive to Christ, what about the law?
[2961.00 → 2962.24] What do we do with the law?
[2963.16 → 2963.30] Right?
[2963.66 → 2970.76] Are the law, which is holy and righteous and good, what is the Christian's new relationship with the law?
[2970.76 → 2976.38] Now, as I was thinking about this week, this illustration came to mind.
[2977.14 → 2981.52] It's from the Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian.
[2982.90 → 2983.26] I don't know.
[2983.32 → 2984.86] Has anybody seen The Mandalorian?
[2985.74 → 2986.06] Okay.
[2986.56 → 2987.80] A couple of people, a couple of people.
[2987.90 → 2988.06] Good.
[2988.76 → 2991.64] Well, it's a great show, if you like Star Wars.
[2991.64 → 3000.60] And the thing about it, it's kind of captured the imaginations of young people today about what it looks like to be bound by a code.
[3001.32 → 3001.46] Right?
[3001.56 → 3005.30] To live by a certain way of life.
[3005.60 → 3008.04] Because in The Mandalorian, what's the thing they say?
[3009.56 → 3010.80] This is the way.
[3011.00 → 3011.40] Thank you.
[3011.88 → 3013.18] This is the way.
[3014.00 → 3020.98] And this phrase is used by these characters, the Mandalorians, who adhere to the way.
[3021.64 → 3027.80] And it expresses their shared beliefs, their shared values, their shared ideals.
[3028.92 → 3034.32] And so as our family was watching this show a couple of years ago, it's so kind of addictive.
[3034.98 → 3036.78] We begin using this phrase all the time.
[3037.32 → 3039.54] So, it is time to get up for school.
[3040.46 → 3041.22] This is the way.
[3041.90 → 3043.20] It's just, you know, did you start saying this?
[3043.28 → 3043.40] Yeah.
[3043.96 → 3044.80] You just start doing it.
[3045.58 → 3046.86] Stop fighting in the back seat.
[3047.40 → 3048.08] This is the way.
[3049.34 → 3050.22] It's a lot of fun.
[3050.32 → 3051.16] I'm kind of glad it's over.
[3051.16 → 3052.48] It's kind of worn off.
[3053.72 → 3062.68] But for the Jews, the people, you know, Paul was writing to the church in Rome that was made up of a majority of Jews, Jewish background believers.
[3064.12 → 3068.54] And for the Jews, they were bound by the law.
[3068.74 → 3071.58] They would say of the law, this is the way.
[3072.64 → 3072.88] Right?
[3072.88 → 3074.96] It was their shared beliefs, their shared values.
[3074.96 → 3077.36] It co-cohered them together as a people.
[3078.44 → 3080.54] It defined their identity as the people of God.
[3081.14 → 3092.28] And so, it's also then interesting that one of the names that was given to the first Christians in the early church, before they were even called Christians, do you know what they were called?
[3092.28 → 3094.42] They were the way.
[3094.80 → 3096.60] Followers of the way.
[3096.60 → 3107.48] And what Paul is saying in our passage this morning is that we were once bound by the way of the law, but now in Christ we are bound to a new way.
[3107.86 → 3108.96] It's the way of the Spirit.
[3108.96 → 3118.00] And so, Christians, in a sense, will say this is the way, and it is now the way of Christ, the way of the Spirit.
[3118.10 → 3127.44] We are bound to him and to follow him, not out of fear or obligation, but now out of freedom and out of love.
[3127.44 → 3139.60] And so, our question this morning is, what does it mean now that we are no longer bound by the law, the old way of the law, and what does it look like now to live according to the new way of the Spirit?
[3140.94 → 3149.60] And so, this passage, this is the first part of Romans 7, what it does is it presents to us a problem, then a solution, and then the result.
[3150.04 → 3151.78] So, that's how we're going to look at this today.
[3152.06 → 3154.64] The problem, the solution, and then the results.
[3154.64 → 3156.28] So, first, the problem.
[3156.78 → 3158.62] What is the problem in our passage?
[3158.76 → 3159.98] Look with me at verse 5.
[3160.44 → 3162.40] So, chapter 7, verse 5, Paul writes,
[3162.94 → 3174.52] For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.
[3175.34 → 3178.28] So, Paul is talking about the law.
[3178.28 → 3189.64] And if you read through the Bible, the Bible is absolutely clear that the law of God, right, the law that was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, is absolutely good.
[3190.54 → 3194.14] The Bible is very, very clear that the law is wonderful.
[3194.32 → 3197.60] It is one of the best gifts that God has ever given his people.
[3197.60 → 3199.74] But here's the problem.
[3200.52 → 3209.02] The problem is that sin took the law of God and used it not to drive us closer to God, but to drive us away from God.
[3210.00 → 3214.00] Okay, sin used the law to drive us away from God.
[3214.40 → 3216.66] Now, how in the world did sin do that?
[3217.20 → 3224.22] How could sin take the law and actually use it against us and drive us away from God?
[3224.22 → 3225.60] Well, it does it in two ways.
[3226.50 → 3234.30] First, you see what he says here, or if you go back one, he talks about our sinful passions.
[3235.14 → 3237.54] So, what does he mean by that, our sinful passions?
[3238.46 → 3241.68] What he means is that, and we've, you know, talked about this, of course, in Romans,
[3241.80 → 3249.98] that every single human being, all of us, within us, is a deep and fundamental desire to be autonomous from God,
[3249.98 → 3256.38] to be completely independent of God, where we don't want to listen to God's voice, but we want to go our own way.
[3257.32 → 3259.32] So, think of Adam and Eve in the garden, right?
[3259.38 → 3261.60] God gave them a good law, a good command.
[3262.12 → 3270.60] You can eat of the fruit of the tree of any tree in this huge garden, thousands and thousands of trees and fruit, bountiful,
[3271.02 → 3272.86] but there's one tree.
[3272.86 → 3276.92] I don't want you to eat from this tree, for if you do, you will surely die.
[3277.98 → 3280.66] So, God says, look, this command is for your own good.
[3280.82 → 3281.90] It is because I love you.
[3282.74 → 3285.90] So, now, what fruits do Adam and Eve now want to eat?
[3287.00 → 3288.02] The forbidden fruit.
[3289.58 → 3297.10] And ever since Adam and Eve in the garden, human beings have always been enticed by forbidden fruit.
[3297.10 → 3307.18] And so, now, because of sin, laws in general, rules in general, tend to raise our appetite for the very thing that they forbid.
[3307.58 → 3307.70] Right?
[3307.74 → 3313.44] If someone tells you not to do something, we bristle at that, and we want to do it.
[3314.50 → 3321.78] I was never so tempted to have a cookie until my mom said, do not take a cookie from the cookie jar.
[3322.36 → 3325.34] Then the only thing on my mind is, I really want a cookie.
[3325.34 → 3330.70] Or here's a really kind of famous example from church history.
[3330.86 → 3335.50] St. Augustine tells a story about himself in his confessions.
[3336.46 → 3337.40] He says this,
[3337.50 → 3344.38] One night at the age of 16, he was with some friends, a gang of misbehaved youth.
[3344.72 → 3347.96] So, this was not a youth group in church, although they could be misbehaved as well.
[3348.50 → 3350.68] But this was before Augustine became a Christian.
[3350.84 → 3351.80] He had a bunch of friends.
[3351.80 → 3362.86] They climbed a wall, snuck into their neighbour's orchard, and Augustine said he shook a tree, the fruit fell from the tree, and he stole the fruit.
[3364.24 → 3370.62] Now, his motive, he says, was not that he was hungry, because he actually threw the fruit away.
[3370.70 → 3371.60] He threw it to the pigs.
[3371.60 → 3373.60] But he says this,
[3373.60 → 3378.64] I stole something which I had in plenty and of much better quality.
[3379.58 → 3391.20] My desire was to enjoy not what I sought by stealing, the fruit, but merely the excitement of thieving and doing of what was wrong.
[3391.20 → 3394.22] So, you see how that works, right?
[3394.34 → 3398.08] Laws arouse our appetite for the thing they forbid.
[3398.98 → 3403.68] And that's exactly the way that sin uses the law of God.
[3404.04 → 3404.86] The law is good.
[3404.90 → 3406.00] There's nothing wrong with the law.
[3406.42 → 3411.56] But because of us, our sin, it arouses a desire to disobey the law.
[3411.56 → 3429.34] Now, there's a second way that sin kind of co-ops the law of God, which is this, that when Israel was, like, pretty compliant with the law, even if they did everything they were supposed to do, the problem is it still never changed their heart.
[3430.46 → 3430.70] Right?
[3430.70 → 3439.44] So, the law was very good at regulating their outward behaviour, but it could never change our inward problem, which is a heart problem.
[3440.26 → 3440.78] Right?
[3440.84 → 3446.02] Because the law, it commands us to love God, essentially, and love our neighbour.
[3446.78 → 3452.00] But it isn't able to produce that love of God and neighbour for us.
[3452.82 → 3454.62] And that is what God is after.
[3454.62 → 3460.44] He wants us to express our love for him and our neighbour by obeying the law.
[3460.70 → 3464.60] And doing what is right and loving him and delighting in our relationship with him.
[3465.10 → 3466.90] So, now, you think about the Pharisees, right?
[3466.98 → 3470.28] Jesus was interacting with the Pharisees all the time.
[3470.58 → 3481.18] And the Pharisees, they observed the law in such a way that they were more compliant with the law of God than anybody else probably in human history.
[3481.74 → 3486.52] And yet, as you know, they ended up being Jesus' worst enemies.
[3486.52 → 3491.02] And Jesus even called them whitewashed tombs.
[3491.54 → 3492.92] That's not very kind.
[3494.10 → 3495.00] But why is that?
[3495.08 → 3497.44] Why did Jesus call the Pharisees whitewashed tombs?
[3497.62 → 3498.06] Think about it.
[3498.08 → 3498.98] What's a whitewashed tomb?
[3499.20 → 3502.62] It looks beautiful on the outside, but there's death on the inside.
[3503.60 → 3509.40] See, they scrupulously kept the law on the outside in their outward behaviour, but on the inside they were dead.
[3509.40 → 3517.94] On the inside, Jesus, you know, the very son of God came to them, but the law, their keeping of the law, drove them away from God.
[3518.64 → 3520.28] The law couldn't change their hearts.
[3521.32 → 3523.20] And friends, that should be a warning to us.
[3523.74 → 3524.18] Right?
[3524.26 → 3528.30] That you and I, we can know right from wrong really clearly.
[3528.30 → 3538.18] And we could even live a morally good life, and yet, in our hearts, we can still be miles and miles away from God.
[3538.92 → 3545.00] We can even use our outward morality as a way to keep God at arm's distance.
[3545.00 → 3551.76] But the thing is, God wants more than just outwardly law-following people.
[3551.90 → 3558.00] God wants, instead, children who love him and who call him Father.
[3559.48 → 3560.26] And so that's the problem.
[3560.36 → 3566.92] The problem of this passage is that the law arouses sinful passions within us, and it can never change our hearts.
[3567.86 → 3570.36] So the law is good, but there's a problem.
[3570.98 → 3572.08] So now, what is the solution?
[3572.20 → 3573.02] That's our second point.
[3573.02 → 3577.22] The solution, according to Paul, is that we have to be set free from the law.
[3577.82 → 3583.22] We just have to be released from the law so that we can be joined to Jesus Christ.
[3583.98 → 3585.12] So let's see how this works.
[3585.66 → 3588.24] First, notice what Paul says in verse 1.
[3589.60 → 3590.02] He says,
[3590.18 → 3594.68] Do you not know, brothers and sisters, for I'm speaking to those who know the law.
[3594.84 → 3598.20] Okay, so he's kind of speaking to the Jews in the church at this point.
[3598.20 → 3605.32] He says that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives.
[3606.12 → 3607.58] Okay, so he's giving us a principle.
[3607.80 → 3609.08] It's very, very simple.
[3610.16 → 3612.64] Death, he says, severs all ties.
[3613.68 → 3614.80] Death is final.
[3614.94 → 3616.26] It ends all obligations.
[3616.26 → 3619.82] Like, when you die, you go beyond the reach of the law.
[3621.46 → 3622.40] Of course, right?
[3622.46 → 3632.64] If you have an outstanding parking ticket or a late fee at the library, okay, if you die, guess what?
[3633.40 → 3634.34] You don't have to pay it.
[3635.10 → 3635.30] Right?
[3635.52 → 3637.32] You're free from the obligations of the law.
[3637.52 → 3639.68] The law has no authority over you at that point.
[3640.98 → 3642.74] That's just the principle Paul's saying.
[3643.10 → 3644.50] And then he gives us an illustration.
[3645.40 → 3646.90] And it's an illustration for marriage.
[3647.02 → 3649.20] So in verses 2 and 3, this is what he says.
[3649.98 → 3656.68] For example, by law, a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive.
[3656.68 → 3661.52] But if her husband dies, he is released from the law that binds her to him.
[3662.22 → 3669.32] So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, that's against the law.
[3669.40 → 3670.50] She's called an adulteress.
[3670.88 → 3677.38] But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
[3678.66 → 3684.58] So now, Paul here, he's not giving us teaching on marriage and divorce and remarriage.
[3684.58 → 3685.52] That's not his point.
[3686.32 → 3688.74] His point is simply an illustration to say this.
[3688.74 → 3694.32] When you're married, you form a relationship that ideally should end in death.
[3695.28 → 3700.94] Once you're married to someone, you're supposed to be married to them until one of you dies.
[3701.12 → 3703.48] And there are other reasons for divorce.
[3703.80 → 3705.14] But that's not what Paul's talking about here.
[3706.26 → 3710.08] But when one of you dies, when one of the spouses dies,
[3710.08 → 3717.68] the living spouse is now free to then marry another person because you are no longer bound in that relationship.
[3717.68 → 3724.24] And so Paul is saying that there's something kind of similar that happens with our relationship to the law.
[3724.88 → 3726.76] Because remember what Paul said in chapter 6.
[3727.68 → 3729.20] You have died, right?
[3729.28 → 3730.56] Remember, you have died.
[3731.52 → 3737.76] You were once, in a sense, bound, joined, married to the law, but you have died in Christ.
[3737.76 → 3742.44] And now, in a sense, you are no longer married to the law.
[3742.52 → 3743.72] You're no longer bound to it.
[3745.16 → 3749.02] We are now released from the demands of the law so that we can marry another.
[3749.46 → 3752.94] So that now you can be joined with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3753.74 → 3757.90] And so when we think about the death of Christ on that cross, wherever it is, moved up here,
[3757.90 → 3765.24] one of the things that means is that you have died with Christ and the law no longer has authority over you.
[3767.20 → 3772.90] Because now you are free to be joined to another, joined to the Lord Jesus.
[3774.12 → 3775.00] And so think of it this way.
[3775.00 → 3781.74] Our relationship with the law in the Old Testament has been replaced by a new relationship with Jesus.
[3782.50 → 3784.04] Now, how does this solve our problem?
[3784.40 → 3786.32] Well, notice what it says in verse 4.
[3786.32 → 3792.56] So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ,
[3792.96 → 3797.62] that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead.
[3798.64 → 3800.46] So this is how it solves our problem.
[3801.06 → 3805.24] Because not only are we free from the authority of the law that condemns us,
[3805.82 → 3810.90] but we are now free from the powerlessness of the law to change us inwardly.
[3811.36 → 3815.28] Before, we were bound to the law, and we could follow the law as best we could,
[3815.28 → 3818.04] but it can never change our hearts, it can never make us love God.
[3818.46 → 3821.62] But now, because we've died in Christ, we've raised with him,
[3821.74 → 3825.86] we have the very life of God now flowing into us.
[3825.86 → 3831.14] The life of God that changes our hearts and transforms us.
[3832.00 → 3836.34] It's the life of heaven in us, changing our desires, our ambitions,
[3836.34 → 3842.12] what we think, what we do, what we say, empowering us now to love God
[3842.12 → 3844.94] and to delight in following his ways.
[3846.56 → 3851.36] It's the very resurrection life of God through the Holy Spirit in our hearts.
[3852.22 → 3853.48] So that's the solution.
[3853.66 → 3854.92] Okay, so what was the problem?
[3855.18 → 3857.86] The problem is that the law can never change our hearts,
[3858.08 → 3862.66] and it only actually arouses desire for living our own way apart from God.
[3862.66 → 3863.76] That's what the law does.
[3864.60 → 3867.52] The solution, we're set free from the law
[3867.52 → 3872.68] so that we can be joined to Jesus Christ and have his life now in us,
[3872.70 → 3877.36] the life that enables us to love God and to delight in the law of God.
[3878.42 → 3881.06] And finally, what does that do for us?
[3881.12 → 3882.46] What are the results of that?
[3883.28 → 3886.16] And there are two results that Paul mentions in our text.
[3886.60 → 3887.58] Okay, so let's look at this.
[3887.66 → 3888.94] This is the third thing, the results.
[3888.94 → 3893.20] The first result that Paul mentions is fruitfulness.
[3894.20 → 3895.82] Okay, so look again with me at verse 4.
[3897.30 → 3897.76] He says,
[3897.92 → 3901.46] So, my brothers and sisters, you have died to the law through the body of Christ
[3901.46 → 3905.24] that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead.
[3905.82 → 3907.56] Now note this, the result,
[3908.48 → 3912.46] in order that we might bear fruit for God.
[3912.46 → 3917.40] Okay, so now that you are joined to Jesus, Paul says,
[3917.78 → 3923.70] this is going to have a very practical, a very concrete effect in your life.
[3924.30 → 3928.04] It means that our lives will now bear fruit for God.
[3929.74 → 3933.44] Now, and we see this all throughout, like the New Testament especially,
[3933.56 → 3935.14] all these letters that Paul writes,
[3935.62 → 3939.32] he talks about how the gospel is just going to transform their lives.
[3939.32 → 3943.64] So, for example, Titus, the book of Titus, chapter 3, verse 1,
[3943.70 → 3947.90] the apostle Paul, he's writing to this guy named Titus on the island of Crete,
[3948.52 → 3950.88] kind of close to where Hannah lives now.
[3950.96 → 3951.54] Have you been to Crete?
[3952.46 → 3953.76] No? Okay, one day.
[3954.80 → 3957.86] So, Paul is writing to Titus, and listen to what he says.
[3957.86 → 3976.60] Now, wouldn't that make a world of difference?
[3976.60 → 3982.80] Then, further down in verse 14 of chapter 3, he says,
[3983.18 → 3987.62] and let our people learn to devote themselves to good works,
[3987.62 → 3992.28] to help cases of urgent need and not be, what?
[3993.50 → 3994.10] Unfruitful.
[3995.90 → 4000.16] You see, the fruit of the life of Christ is good works.
[4000.68 → 4002.66] And the good works of bearing fruit,
[4002.66 → 4005.96] it's not just some airy-fairy kind of vague idea.
[4006.56 → 4008.58] It's extremely specific.
[4009.44 → 4009.70] Right?
[4009.76 → 4014.52] It is just the entire kaleidoscope of the Christian life,
[4014.60 → 4016.22] of Christian godliness and holiness,
[4016.54 → 4021.14] and it's shown through very specific words and thoughts and actions and deeds.
[4021.98 → 4022.34] Right?
[4022.40 → 4024.80] Where we attend to the needs of the poor,
[4025.34 → 4027.82] and we are steadfast in prayer,
[4027.82 → 4029.92] and we are sexually pure,
[4029.92 → 4032.82] even when we are aching to be disobedient,
[4033.78 → 4036.88] and we work for unity in the body of Christ,
[4037.56 → 4039.78] and we're perfectly courteous to all.
[4040.02 → 4041.60] We don't speak evil about anyone.
[4041.98 → 4044.44] We give generously to gospel causes,
[4044.66 → 4046.58] and to causes in our community.
[4047.66 → 4047.88] Right?
[4047.96 → 4051.82] We plan our calendars around our Christian commitments
[4051.82 → 4054.48] to come and to worship the Lord on Sunday mornings.
[4054.48 → 4059.54] And it's not expecting other people to serve us all the time,
[4059.62 → 4062.46] but it's being willing to actively serve others.
[4063.42 → 4065.36] You know whether or not they can actually repay you.
[4066.30 → 4068.40] See, it's very practical.
[4069.42 → 4071.20] We are released from the law,
[4071.70 → 4074.66] but it doesn't mean we get to ignore the law.
[4074.82 → 4077.20] It doesn't mean we now just live however we want.
[4077.90 → 4078.94] And so the law now is,
[4079.36 → 4083.18] the law is not the basis for our relationship with God.
[4083.18 → 4083.74] Right?
[4084.12 → 4087.76] Our obedience to the law cannot determine our relationship to God.
[4088.38 → 4091.78] But now, as servants of Jesus,
[4092.00 → 4094.28] as, in a sense, married to Christ,
[4094.72 → 4097.44] we now delight to do his will.
[4097.84 → 4100.18] We now have the ability to love him
[4100.18 → 4102.20] and to follow the way of Jesus.
[4103.46 → 4104.64] So let me give you an example.
[4105.38 → 4106.02] I am a father.
[4106.20 → 4106.94] I have four children.
[4108.48 → 4109.36] One is in there.
[4109.68 → 4110.14] I have four.
[4110.62 → 4111.70] Sometimes I do have to count.
[4111.70 → 4112.88] One, two, three, four.
[4112.94 → 4113.54] Okay, we're all here.
[4114.50 → 4117.94] Now, the civil law, the law of Canada,
[4118.44 → 4120.58] requires that I what?
[4121.36 → 4123.60] I take care of my kids, right?
[4123.94 → 4126.86] If I neglect them, I can get in trouble.
[4127.76 → 4131.60] But that is not what motivates me to care for my kids.
[4132.30 → 4132.46] Right?
[4132.50 → 4135.68] I don't care for them because I'm afraid of the law
[4135.68 → 4136.68] and getting in trouble.
[4136.68 → 4138.84] I care for them because I love them.
[4139.64 → 4143.50] And my love for my kids then makes me fulfill the law.
[4143.58 → 4145.10] I actually care what the law says.
[4145.74 → 4148.42] But because I love them, I will care for them.
[4148.48 → 4149.36] I will provide for them.
[4149.54 → 4152.08] I will do the maximum for them, not just the minimum,
[4152.24 → 4153.28] not just to kind of get by.
[4154.90 → 4155.12] Right?
[4155.12 → 4160.28] I live for them out of love, not out of obligation to the law.
[4160.96 → 4166.82] And that's the exact same dynamic that happens in the Christian life
[4166.82 → 4169.22] through the Holy Spirit when we're joined to Jesus.
[4169.50 → 4169.64] Right?
[4169.72 → 4172.30] The Spirit fills us with the life of heaven,
[4172.50 → 4173.90] with the love of God,
[4173.90 → 4178.10] so that we just fulfill the law of Christ,
[4178.26 → 4179.54] loving God and loving others,
[4179.70 → 4180.46] just because,
[4181.72 → 4182.78] not out of obligation,
[4183.20 → 4185.38] not to earn our relationship with God,
[4185.78 → 4187.92] but simply because we love him.
[4188.86 → 4191.68] And we are growing in our love for him and with others.
[4192.96 → 4194.28] Now that, the final thing,
[4194.34 → 4196.80] that leads us to the second result of being joined to Christ.
[4197.18 → 4199.96] And that is in the final verse of our passage today,
[4200.28 → 4200.94] verse 6.
[4201.90 → 4203.04] Paul writes at the end,
[4203.04 → 4203.90] But now,
[4204.54 → 4206.68] by dying to what once bound us,
[4206.74 → 4208.16] we have been released from the law,
[4208.46 → 4212.06] so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit,
[4212.38 → 4214.76] not the old way of the written code.
[4215.42 → 4215.66] Okay?
[4215.80 → 4217.40] So he's talking about the Holy Spirit.
[4217.80 → 4218.92] Today is Pentecost Sunday.
[4219.56 → 4220.38] It lines up.
[4221.02 → 4223.28] I didn't have to choose a different passage for Pentecost Sunday.
[4224.32 → 4229.56] The Spirit continually refreshes our life with God.
[4229.56 → 4233.32] The Holy Spirit binds us more closely with Jesus,
[4233.32 → 4235.26] so that we love God more,
[4235.82 → 4237.44] and we hate our sin more.
[4238.62 → 4241.48] You know, the old way of the law does not do that.
[4241.48 → 4243.66] That is the work of the Spirit.
[4244.30 → 4245.92] And notice Paul says,
[4246.70 → 4249.04] the new way of the Spirit.
[4249.64 → 4254.62] And Paul uses this word new all the time to describe the Christian life.
[4254.62 → 4257.90] He says it's like this new wine that is fermenting,
[4258.44 → 4260.12] is growing in potency,
[4260.46 → 4261.08] and in flavour,
[4261.22 → 4262.00] is bubbling up.
[4262.04 → 4265.98] It can't be contained in the old wineskins of the law.
[4265.98 → 4268.54] It's the new covenant.
[4269.36 → 4271.72] It's the Holy Spirit living in us,
[4272.52 → 4276.44] communicating and conveying the very life of God into our hearts.
[4277.32 → 4281.46] And he says every single person who is a Christian is a new creation.
[4281.98 → 4284.02] And we have a new song in our hearts,
[4284.10 → 4285.04] and we have a new hope,
[4285.34 → 4286.00] and a new heaven,
[4286.10 → 4286.78] and a new earth.
[4287.82 → 4289.06] It's the way of the Spirit.
[4289.06 → 4293.18] Now, I don't want to give you the impression, though,
[4293.20 → 4294.08] that this is easy,
[4295.00 → 4295.86] or natural,
[4296.12 → 4297.04] or effortless.
[4297.16 → 4298.80] Actually, it is a great struggle.
[4299.28 → 4299.84] And Paul,
[4300.62 → 4301.88] in the rest of Romans 7,
[4301.98 → 4303.54] is going to talk about that struggle,
[4303.70 → 4305.22] which we'll talk about in a couple of weeks,
[4305.30 → 4306.40] because I'm going to be away at Synod,
[4306.82 → 4308.82] and we'll have Todd Stat ham and Gary Rosema
[4308.82 → 4310.22] preaching for us the next two weeks.
[4311.06 → 4313.52] Then we're going to jump back to Romans 7 after that.
[4315.02 → 4316.18] But as we close,
[4316.64 → 4318.32] here's the question for us today
[4318.32 → 4320.30] from these verses in Romans 7.
[4320.72 → 4321.86] And the question is,
[4322.78 → 4323.90] the way of the Spirit,
[4324.92 → 4326.00] does this describe you?
[4326.82 → 4328.02] Does this describe me?
[4329.18 → 4329.40] Right?
[4329.52 → 4333.46] Do you experience the life of the Spirit within you?
[4334.70 → 4338.74] Do you experience Christ giving you fresh desires,
[4339.44 → 4341.06] and fresh love,
[4341.48 → 4343.90] to give yourself in love,
[4344.16 → 4345.16] to do good works,
[4345.22 → 4345.96] to bear fruit,
[4346.06 → 4347.90] and not so you'll get approval from God,
[4347.90 → 4349.50] not so you'll get approval from others,
[4350.24 → 4354.18] but because this is what would please your Lord Jesus Christ.
[4355.36 → 4356.48] Friends, this morning,
[4356.60 → 4358.44] what God offers to us freely
[4358.44 → 4360.28] is the Lord Jesus.
[4360.28 → 4364.54] He says you can be set free from the demands of the law,
[4364.90 → 4366.26] the law that only condemns,
[4366.26 → 4369.22] and you can have Christ and be united to him.
[4369.88 → 4371.20] And you do that by faith,
[4371.24 → 4372.08] and when you do that,
[4372.16 → 4373.56] you recent Jesus by faith.
[4374.02 → 4376.50] He gives you the power and his presence
[4376.50 → 4379.70] that you may then walk in newness of life.
[4379.70 → 4382.04] So let's pray together.
[4385.38 → 4388.86] Father, we ask that you would, Lord,
[4388.96 → 4390.28] so fill us with your Spirit,
[4390.92 → 4395.82] that we would be enabled to love you
[4395.82 → 4398.02] with everything that we have,
[4398.48 → 4401.02] that we would, by your grace and your mercy,
[4401.88 → 4405.06] just bear fruit for your glory.
[4405.06 → 4406.96] Would you give us, Lord,
[4407.00 → 4409.58] a deep joy in our relationship with you,
[4409.84 → 4410.46] and give us, Lord,
[4410.48 → 4413.02] a deep desire to obey you more and more.
[4413.58 → 4414.70] We pray in Jesus' name,
[4415.14 → 4415.78] and for his sake.
[4416.04 → 4416.24] Amen.
[4419.20 → 4419.76] All right.
[4420.12 → 4421.16] I know it's warm,
[4421.28 → 4423.74] and hopefully not too many of you fell asleep.
[4425.62 → 4427.14] So go ahead and stand,
[4427.62 → 4430.08] and we'll enjoy the cool breeze,
[4430.14 → 4433.34] and we'll sing a song of response to God's word.
[4433.34 → 4434.24] We'll stand and sing.
[4434.24 → 4459.74] Holy Spirit, heaven and heaven, God, give your life to my heaven's heart.
[4459.74 → 4472.74] Bring the presence of the risen Lord, to the new Lord, and make me whole.
[4472.74 → 4485.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[4485.74 → 4497.74] Give me passion for the glory of the Holy Spirit, with your life to me.
[4497.74 → 4509.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4509.74 → 4521.74] Love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4521.74 → 4533.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4533.74 → 4547.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4547.74 → 4561.74] Holy Spirit, with creation's birth, living life to all that God has made.
[4561.74 → 4567.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4567.74 → 4573.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4573.74 → 4587.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4587.74 → 4596.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4596.74 → 4602.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in of me.
[4602.74 → 4607.74] God, my own love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4607.74 → 4610.74] God's love, Lord, to come alive in me. Give me joy, sing in all the truth.
[4610.74 → 4624.50] God in you, to the face of words, may be near for all the world to see.
[4624.50 → 4643.44] So as we continue to worship the Lord in response to the grace of our merciful God,
[4643.86 → 4647.12] we now worship him through the giving of our offerings.
[4648.26 → 4650.86] And so God, you know, we acknowledge has given us everything.
[4650.86 → 4654.38] And in our offering, we just return to him some of what he has given us.
[4654.42 → 4660.26] And we do so just out of the free heart of gratitude to him for the furtherance of his kingdom.
[4660.68 → 4666.82] And our designated offering is for Hannah Vanderkamp and her ministry in Greece.
[4666.92 → 4671.38] And so actually, as the deacons come and collect the morning offering,
[4671.58 → 4676.22] Hannah is going to share a brief update about her ministry.
[4676.64 → 4677.46] So come on up, Hannah.
[4680.86 → 4689.10] Good morning.
[4689.52 → 4695.28] I must mention, I haven't been to Crete, but I'm married to a Cretan.
[4696.96 → 4698.84] I don't know if I need to go to Crete.
[4700.70 → 4704.44] Anyway, so nice to be home again for a little while.
[4704.44 → 4709.02] As you look at the slide, do we have the slide there?
[4709.20 → 4709.34] Yeah.
[4710.40 → 4716.26] I want to continue telling the story of Ahmed, the subject of my last newsletter,
[4716.44 → 4722.74] and the young man who escaped brutality in two countries before arriving in the camp on Lesbos.
[4723.42 → 4729.06] He was one of my few advanced students, and the work we did was more focused on integration
[4729.06 → 4731.80] as he sought to understand his new environment.
[4733.12 → 4740.04] In his country, he had never spoken to a woman or touched a woman who was not part of his family.
[4740.72 → 4750.04] Suddenly, here in the camp, he is expected to tell all the details of his life to a woman who interviews him for his asylum claim.
[4750.04 → 4754.72] He has difficulty initially even looking into her eyes.
[4755.86 → 4763.58] His relatives call him every day, advising him not to talk to women and to stay away from Westerners in general.
[4764.64 → 4768.62] They will try to change you and your Muslim faith, they warn him.
[4768.62 → 4777.06] However, he once taught English, and he is naturally outgoing.
[4777.68 → 4785.82] So he joins my English class, and we begin discussing all kinds of issues connected to texts we study.
[4786.72 → 4793.80] He soon connects with the resident volunteers with Year Relief and starts assisting the classes for kids in the camp.
[4793.80 → 4800.84] He works with some Mennonite women, and he asks why they have head coverings.
[4801.40 → 4805.10] He thinks they are pastors of some kind, maybe nuns.
[4805.90 → 4810.00] I explain that they are not, and we look at the Mennonite faith and history.
[4810.92 → 4813.08] He is impressed by their convictions.
[4814.62 → 4820.54] He decides that he wants to come to the Oasis Church, where many Years Relief volunteers worship.
[4820.54 → 4825.98] When he leaves a camp on Sunday morning, his roommates ask him where he is going,
[4826.16 → 4830.82] because they have learned that Sunday morning is when the Christians go to church.
[4831.68 → 4834.72] He tells them that this is ridiculous and that he has a meeting.
[4835.58 → 4838.08] He doesn't tell them the meeting is at a church.
[4839.44 → 4843.54] He enjoys the songs and remarks on the beautiful lyrics.
[4844.06 → 4849.16] He sees many of the volunteers he already knows and tells me he feels comfortable there.
[4850.54 → 4854.34] The next day, many of his fellow countrymen leave the camp,
[4854.82 → 4860.46] since they have obtained their passports, which allows them to travel within the European Union.
[4861.06 → 4864.64] They hope to go to the UK, however, and head off to France.
[4865.62 → 4872.14] They leave him some Lyrics pills, an antidepressant, which some of them have been eating like candies,
[4872.90 → 4877.36] perhaps a replacement for the stimulant cat, called cat,
[4877.36 → 4879.62] which they normally chew in their own country.
[4880.80 → 4885.94] Sadly, some of them have spent their entire time in the camp sleeping and lying around.
[4886.90 → 4890.70] He shakes his head as he thinks of all the things he has learned so far
[4890.70 → 4893.10] in the two short months he has been living there.
[4894.10 → 4896.50] He feels a freedom he has never had before,
[4897.08 → 4899.88] and he decides to talk to the pastor at the church,
[4899.92 → 4902.82] because he has so many questions about Christianity.
[4902.82 → 4908.36] He has been told he needs to leave the camp in a day or two,
[4908.90 → 4911.92] and comes to class pondering what his next steps will be.
[4912.64 → 4915.28] We discuss job opportunities and possibilities,
[4915.92 → 4918.96] and he decides to either try to get a job locally,
[4918.96 → 4921.64] or go off to join his compatriots in France.
[4922.42 → 4926.44] He does not say that he will try to go to the UK to me,
[4926.44 → 4929.06] because he knows that I strongly advise him
[4929.06 → 4933.12] against trying to cross the busiest shipping channel in the world.
[4933.86 → 4937.18] I feel worried about him, and the many others.
[4943.18 → 4945.60] And the many others that are leaving the camp.
[4945.60 → 4955.26] Some of them are so poorly equipped.
[4958.74 → 4963.42] My assistant feels the weight of the difficulties these people face.
[4963.42 → 4978.14] And, sorry, she asked me how I have been able to work in the camp for so many years.
[4983.26 → 4988.96] I am learning that any difference we can make is only by his grace.
[4988.96 → 4993.42] Thank you so much for your generous giving,
[4993.70 → 4998.30] which makes it possible for me to continue serving people like Ahmed.
[4998.86 → 5000.02] Thank you once again.
[5000.02 → 5016.30] Thank you, Hannah, for sharing your ministry.
[5016.86 → 5021.26] And, you know, you serve in a very difficult place.
[5021.30 → 5023.24] I see a lot of people who have a lot of needs,
[5023.64 → 5026.58] and you're there because of your love for the Lord
[5026.58 → 5029.18] and for people who need him.
[5029.18 → 5030.88] So, we appreciate that.
[5031.48 → 5033.12] And let's go to the Lord now in prayer.
[5034.10 → 5036.78] We'll pray for Ahmed, and we'll pray for others.
[5039.10 → 5042.92] O God, you who rule and reign on high,
[5043.92 → 5047.48] but delight to call us your sons and daughters.
[5047.86 → 5049.96] Lord, we bring our needs before you.
[5050.74 → 5052.70] Not because we think you don't know them,
[5053.50 → 5058.10] much less, Lord, because we demand you to answer them the way we want,
[5058.10 → 5063.66] but rather, Lord, we come to you in prayer because you have invited us to.
[5064.78 → 5068.46] So, Lord, would you please hear us now and answer us, Lord,
[5068.50 → 5070.94] according to your will, for your glory,
[5071.86 → 5074.28] and for the blessing of your world.
[5074.66 → 5076.84] And so, Lord, we do pray for our world now.
[5077.66 → 5080.36] There is so much poverty, and there is so much difficulty.
[5080.36 → 5087.48] Lord, we pray for the 122 million people who've had to flee their homes.
[5089.60 → 5093.06] Lord, we pray especially for Ahmed and others like him
[5093.06 → 5096.38] who are trying to find a new life, a new place.
[5097.38 → 5101.74] The Lord face many, not only difficulties, but many dangers as well.
[5103.00 → 5104.16] Lord, we pray for Hannah.
[5104.16 → 5108.60] We thank you, Lord, that you have sent her to this refugee camp
[5108.60 → 5110.42] to be your hands and your feet,
[5110.62 → 5114.10] to the many people who come through that place.
[5114.86 → 5116.34] Father, would you sustain her?
[5116.92 → 5121.12] Would you help her to be a strong and bold witness to the gospel,
[5121.72 → 5127.24] to the many, many people who do not only need, and who are looking for a home,
[5127.44 → 5129.64] but also who need, Lord, a Saviour?
[5129.64 → 5133.98] We pray that you, Lord, would be a refuge for the needy.
[5135.12 → 5138.30] We also pray this morning, Lord, for the people of Gaza
[5138.30 → 5142.34] and for wars in other places in the world.
[5144.76 → 5146.36] Lord, you are the God of peace.
[5147.08 → 5150.34] Would you please, Lord, bring peace?
[5151.10 → 5152.36] Would you provide for the hungry?
[5152.36 → 5160.16] Lord, we pray for the churches that are worshipping at this hour,
[5160.52 → 5163.14] whether here in Ladder or even all around the world,
[5163.86 → 5165.76] even in refugee camps.
[5166.72 → 5167.96] Bless them, Lord, in every way.
[5168.88 → 5172.40] And we ask that you would bring increase to your church, Lord,
[5172.42 → 5175.52] not just in numbers, but an increase in love
[5175.52 → 5180.12] and an increase, Lord, in following the way of our Lord Jesus.
[5180.12 → 5184.56] We pray, Lord, for the needs in our own congregation.
[5184.88 → 5186.54] We pray, Lord, for the sick and the suffering.
[5186.74 → 5191.34] We pray especially, Lord, for Artistry in hospice.
[5191.66 → 5193.16] We pray for Michael Wayne.
[5194.26 → 5197.68] And, Lord, as both of them struggle with cancer,
[5198.18 → 5200.46] we pray, Lord, that you would have mercy
[5200.46 → 5202.90] and your healing hand would be upon them
[5202.90 → 5204.94] and, Lord, your presence would be close to them.
[5205.58 → 5207.82] We pray for all others as well
[5207.82 → 5209.90] who face sufferings of different kinds.
[5210.34 → 5213.84] Lord, be with Henry Kevin in Delta Hospital
[5213.84 → 5215.82] as she undergoes tests.
[5217.76 → 5219.34] Lord, be with Martin Hamming,
[5219.56 → 5223.06] who had a procedure and who is recovering now.
[5224.06 → 5227.14] Lord, be with all of those who need your healing touch.
[5227.66 → 5228.98] We pray for all their recovery.
[5230.30 → 5231.58] Lord, we pray for Synod
[5231.58 → 5235.02] as Synod gathers and begins to meet this coming week.
[5235.02 → 5238.98] We pray for all the delegates who are coming to that time.
[5239.62 → 5243.38] And as they consider, Lord, the overtures brought before them,
[5243.50 → 5244.56] give them wisdom.
[5245.40 → 5249.82] Give them grace to argue and love about what is true
[5249.82 → 5251.72] and about the best way,
[5252.48 → 5255.14] the best path for us to proceed as a denomination.
[5256.00 → 5257.64] Lord, be with us in every way.
[5258.54 → 5260.20] Thank you, Lord, for all of your blessings,
[5260.76 → 5262.92] which are even too many to count.
[5263.52 → 5265.96] We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[5266.48 → 5266.76] Amen.
[5266.86 → 5267.26] Amen.
[5268.66 → 5269.52] Let's all stand.
[5269.52 → 5273.50] And we're going to go out now
[5273.50 → 5275.44] and be sent out with a benediction.
[5276.84 → 5278.36] And I want to say this,
[5278.40 → 5279.44] that in that sending,
[5279.62 → 5280.84] in this giving of the benediction,
[5281.40 → 5283.12] it's not that we're going out alone.
[5283.20 → 5284.82] It's not like, okay, God blesses you.
[5284.82 → 5286.86] Now go and live for the Lord
[5286.86 → 5288.52] in your own strength and power.
[5289.62 → 5292.72] But no, actually, we are sent with the Spirit.
[5293.60 → 5294.92] The Spirit goes with us.
[5295.32 → 5296.92] So I invite you to open your hands
[5296.92 → 5298.64] to receive this benediction.
[5299.64 → 5301.06] Jesus said to his disciples,
[5301.58 → 5302.68] Peace be with you.
[5303.08 → 5305.30] Even as the Father has sent me,
[5305.92 → 5307.14] so I am sending you.
[5307.60 → 5308.42] And when he said this,
[5308.46 → 5309.90] he breathed on them and said,
[5310.26 → 5311.70] Receive the Holy Spirit.
[5312.52 → 5312.84] Amen.
[5314.58 → 5315.86] So we'll remain standing.
[5316.10 → 5317.06] We'll sing our final song.
[5317.16 → 5318.12] And then please do join us
[5318.12 → 5320.12] for a time of coffee and fellowship
[5320.12 → 5321.24] right through the doors
[5321.24 → 5322.18] in our fellowship hall.
[5328.64 → 5330.84] Amen.
[5331.64 → 5345.36] Basically, after a time of coffee,
[5345.36 → 5351.92] And the fellowship of God is free
[5351.92 → 5357.54] Keep our hearts and minds within His heart
[5357.54 → 5363.60] Let for Him be blessed for His joy is free
[5363.60 → 5369.36] From the desert of Him to the heights of heaven
[5369.36 → 5375.02] We declare the meaning of the Lamb of sin
[5375.02 → 5380.66] Christ into the King of sin
[5380.66 → 5393.98] We have a space which passes under sight
[5393.98 → 5399.36] And this grace which breaks us from beyond
[5399.36 → 5404.92] And this fellowship of Christ on you
[5404.92 → 5410.56] We have a space which breaks us from beyond
[5410.56 → 5416.20] And to Him be blessed for His glorious name
[5416.20 → 5421.84] From the depths of heaven to the heights of heaven
[5421.84 → 5427.78] We declare the name of the Lamb of sin
[5427.78 → 5432.84] Christ into the Lord, the King of peace
[5432.84 → 5438.48] Christ into the King of sin
[5438.48 → 5444.12] Christ into the King of sin
[5444.12 → 5449.76] Christ into the King of sin
[5449.76 → 5452.40] Christ into the King of sin
[5455.40 → 5456.02] In the extreme 함
[5456.02 → 5460.30] This field of sin
[5460.44 → 5460.76] Christ into the King of sin
[5460.76 → 5461.02] Christ into the King of sin
[5461.02 → 5463.00] Other in his life
[5463.00 → 5464.32] May change our words
[5464.32 → 5465.00] of grace below
[5465.00 → 5467.00] And this servant of sin
[5467.00 → 5469.18] Christ into the King of sin
