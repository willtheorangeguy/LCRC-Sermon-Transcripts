[1238.00 → 1240.00] Good afternoon.
[1240.00 → 1244.00] On behalf of the BART family, welcome.
[1244.00 → 1246.00] Welcome to this memorial service.
[1246.00 → 1249.00] And thank you for gathering with us today.
[1249.00 → 1252.00] For those of you who do not know me, my name is Jason True.
[1252.00 → 1255.00] I'm the pastor here at Lanyard Christian Reformed Church.
[1255.00 → 1258.00] And I am grateful to be here with you.
[1258.00 → 1270.00] We are here today to give praise, and thanks to God for the life of our dear friend, our brother in Christ, Michael Barth.
[1270.00 → 1280.00] And so we come together to seek the Lord's comfort, to put our hope in the risen Jesus Christ.
[1280.00 → 1290.00] And we also come to remember Michael's life, to celebrate some of the good memories that we've had with him, and also to share our sadness.
[1290.00 → 1295.00] To share our sadness that he is no longer with us, but that he is with the Lord.
[1295.00 → 1301.00] And we do all of this, of course, looking to Jesus Christ, who is our redeemer.
[1301.00 → 1307.00] And so as we begin our time of worship today, let's pray.
[1307.00 → 1311.00] Let's ask for God's presence and for his blessing upon us.
[1311.00 → 1313.00] Would you join me in prayer?
[1313.00 → 1324.00] Oh God, our Heavenly Father, we praise you because in your presence there is no darkness and there is no death.
[1324.00 → 1326.00] Lord, you have made us in your image.
[1326.00 → 1330.00] You breathed the life of your spirit into us.
[1330.00 → 1332.00] And you have given us life.
[1332.00 → 1334.00] And so we worship, and we adore you.
[1334.00 → 1336.00] You are the living God.
[1336.00 → 1341.00] Our Lord Jesus Christ, you are the resurrection and the life.
[1341.00 → 1344.00] You died for each one of us.
[1344.00 → 1348.00] And you rose from the grave, opening the way of eternal life.
[1348.00 → 1351.00] And so we praise you as the risen Lord.
[1351.00 → 1359.00] And Holy Spirit, you are the counsellor, and you are the comforter of everyone who grieves.
[1359.00 → 1365.00] We praise you for your presence with us even now at this moment.
[1365.00 → 1368.00] God, you are the God of compassion and love.
[1368.00 → 1381.00] And so we look to you this morning because we believe that our only hope is that we belong, body and soul, in life and in death, to our faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1381.00 → 1388.00] Lord, we ask that you would be with us now, each one of us, that we might know your comfort and receive your blessing.
[1388.00 → 1392.00] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1392.00 → 1398.00] So, as we begin, let's also hear from the Lord.
[1398.00 → 1401.00] We hear his word in the Bible.
[1401.00 → 1411.00] And in the Bible, he gives us many promises that are a great comfort for us in a time like this when we gather to mourn.
[1411.00 → 1414.00] The psalmist proclaims this,
[1414.00 → 1422.00] As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[1422.00 → 1425.00] For he knows how we are formed.
[1425.00 → 1428.00] He remembers that we are dust.
[1428.00 → 1431.00] Our Lord Jesus Christ said,
[1431.00 → 1434.00] I am the resurrection and the life.
[1434.00 → 1439.00] The one who believes in me will live even though they die.
[1439.00 → 1445.00] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[1445.00 → 1448.00] The apostle Paul writes,
[1448.00 → 1450.00] I have fought the good fight.
[1450.00 → 1452.00] I have finished the race.
[1452.00 → 1454.00] I have kept the faith.
[1454.00 → 1462.00] Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day.
[1462.00 → 1468.00] And not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
[1468.00 → 1472.00] So we take great comfort in God's promises to us.
[1472.00 → 1474.00] And so let's stand.
[1474.00 → 1478.00] Mike loved to sing, as many of us do.
[1478.00 → 1482.00] So we will start by singing some songs of praise to the Lord.
[1482.00 → 1483.00] Let's stand.
[1483.00 → 1486.00] The words will be on the screens here to the side.
[1486.00 → 1498.00] How many skies used mayors?
[1498.00 → 1515.32] You are discussing in
[1515.32 → 1520.80] Christoph, shadow of turning with thee,
[1522.34 → 1529.58] Thou changes, нач FPT's promises within God
[1529.58 → 1537.38] As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be
[1537.38 → 1546.36] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1546.78 → 1553.64] Morning by morning, new mercies I see.
[1554.72 → 1561.60] All I have needed by hand has no idea.
[1561.60 → 1571.60] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1573.60 → 1580.98] Thunder and winter and springtime and harvest.
[1582.32 → 1588.60] Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[1588.60 → 1597.60] Join with all nature in magical witness.
[1599.00 → 1606.60] To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[1607.60 → 1615.60] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1615.60 → 1623.60] Morning by morning, new mercies I see.
[1625.20 → 1632.60] All I have needed by hand has provided.
[1633.60 → 1642.60] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1642.60 → 1652.60] Lord, and Lord, sing in the peace that you turn.
[1652.60 → 1661.78] My own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[1662.60 → 1669.60] Tread for to prayer and hope for tomorrow.
[1669.60 → 1671.60] Blessings, O Lord, and new mercies I see.
[1671.60 → 1676.60] Blessings, O Lord, and new mercies I see.
[1676.60 → 1683.60] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1683.60 → 1687.60] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1687.60 → 1695.60] Great is thy faithfulness, for in thy glory, new mercies I see.
[1695.60 → 1696.60] All I have needed by hand has provided.
[1696.60 → 1705.60] All I have needed by hand has provided.
[1705.60 → 1716.60] Praise thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1716.60 → 1726.60] Praise thy faithfulness, Lord, and new registering CCI to you as your host Harlan.
[1726.60 → 1746.60] Piano music
[1746.60 → 1757.08] When peace like a river that ended my way,
[1757.08 → 1765.08] and sorrows like sea wills roll,
[1766.26 → 1776.30] forever my love thou hast loved me to say,
[1776.60 → 1785.74] in Israel, in Israel with my soul.
[1785.74 → 1796.32] In Israel, with my soul.
[1796.32 → 1808.46] In Israel, with my soul.
[1808.46 → 1821.60] I sing of the praise of his glorious heart.
[1821.60 → 1829.60] I sing not in part, but the whole.
[1830.74 → 1840.08] He'll steal to the cross, and I bear it no more.
[1840.08 → 1846.22] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
[1846.22 → 1849.22] with my soul.
[1849.22 → 1858.36] In Israel, with my soul.
[1858.36 → 1862.36] In Israel, with my soul.
[1862.36 → 1871.50] In Israel, with my soul.
[1871.50 → 1873.50] In Israel, with my soul.
[1873.50 → 1882.64] In Israel, with my soul.
[1882.64 → 1886.64] In Israel, with my soul.
[1886.64 → 1895.78] In Israel, with my soul.
[1895.78 → 1904.92] In Israel, with my soul.
[1904.92 → 1910.92] In Israel, with my soul.
[1910.92 → 1915.84] In Israel, with my soul.
[1915.84 → 1924.98] In Israel, with my soul.
[1924.98 → 1927.98] In Israel, with my soul.
[1927.98 → 1930.98] In Israel, with my soul.
[1930.98 → 1943.12] In Israel, with my soul.
[1943.12 → 1945.12] In Israel, with my soul.
[1945.12 → 1947.12] In Israel, with my soul.
[1947.12 → 1959.26] In Israel, with my soul.
[1959.26 → 1962.36] So it is also good not only to praise the Lord,
[1962.36 → 1965.38] and put our hope and trust in him through song,
[1965.38 → 1969.68] but also to remember Michael and all that he meant to us.
[1969.68 → 1972.58] And so I'm going to invite Johan, who is Mike's son,
[1972.58 → 1975.28] to come up and share a eulogy with us.
[1975.28 → 1979.62] And then following that, Mike's brother, Ike,
[1979.62 → 1982.42] will also come up and share some family memories.
[1996.24 → 1997.44] Good afternoon, everyone.
[2000.58 → 2003.58] First, I'd like to thank everyone for coming.
[2003.58 → 2010.12] For those who sent their condolences, cards, flowers.
[2010.12 → 2012.22] Those who have come from far away.
[2012.22 → 2014.92] And those who are joining us online.
[2014.92 → 2020.34] Thank you to Pastor Jason and to Dorothy,
[2020.34 → 2022.74] and anyone else who has helped along the way.
[2022.74 → 2028.38] Your kind words and deeds mean so much to us.
[2028.38 → 2032.52] As young children, my younger sister, Evelyn and I,
[2032.52 → 2035.92] learned probably more than we cared to
[2035.92 → 2039.62] about my dad's early life in Holland.
[2039.62 → 2043.52] How as a youngster, his home city of Rotterdam
[2043.52 → 2047.34] was mercilessly bombed.
[2047.34 → 2050.84] How he remembered being chased by Nazi officers
[2050.84 → 2053.04] through hollowed out buildings.
[2053.04 → 2057.98] How all the apple carts, bicycles, and even his own father
[2057.98 → 2059.58] were taken off to Germany.
[2059.58 → 2062.68] How he and his family and neighbours were,
[2062.68 → 2067.88] at least by the end of the war, covered in boils and lice,
[2067.88 → 2071.52] and ate tulip bulbs just to have something in their tummy.
[2071.52 → 2074.22] Were it not for the food rations,
[2074.22 → 2077.02] airdropped by British and Canadian planes,
[2077.02 → 2081.92] they were weeks away from dying of starvation.
[2081.92 → 2085.46] It is a childhood, if you can call it that,
[2085.46 → 2089.16] that we had a hard time relating to.
[2089.16 → 2092.16] One that left a great lasting impression on him
[2092.16 → 2094.76] for his entire life.
[2094.76 → 2097.06] Growing up as we did in Canada,
[2097.06 → 2100.18] even though we were not wealthy by any means,
[2100.18 → 2104.18] we had a roof over our heads, we had clothes on our back,
[2104.18 → 2105.78] we had food in our tummies,
[2105.78 → 2110.58] and we didn't know anything other than peace.
[2110.58 → 2112.92] He made us grateful for these basic human needs
[2112.92 → 2117.82] that we truly often did at times take for granted.
[2117.82 → 2121.32] He wanted desperately for us to have a good education,
[2121.32 → 2123.72] to have a future opportunity that he could not have
[2123.72 → 2128.04] been managed for himself.
[2128.04 → 2131.94] It wasn't always easy being his son or daughter.
[2131.94 → 2135.34] He could be incredibly stubborn.
[2135.34 → 2141.04] Wouldn't choose, wouldn't house, wouldn't listen.
[2141.04 → 2146.08] A trait that thankfully skips a generation.
[2146.08 → 2149.78] Some of his firmly held opinions were seemingly on facts
[2149.78 → 2153.40] or information that was 50 years old.
[2153.40 → 2157.10] I told him I could help him grow his carrots better and faster.
[2157.10 → 2160.60] After all, I had gone to school to learn how forests grow.
[2160.60 → 2163.50] Surely I could help him with his carrots.
[2163.50 → 2169.24] No, no, you have no idea what you're talking about.
[2169.24 → 2171.34] Trying to change his mind with new information
[2171.34 → 2176.38] was often like trying to clip a feral pig's toenails.
[2176.38 → 2179.32] Pretty near impossible.
[2179.32 → 2181.16] He wasn't able to teach us all things,
[2181.16 → 2183.26] but he taught us some of the basics.
[2183.26 → 2188.80] How to ride a bike, how to drive a car, how to change a tire,
[2188.80 → 2192.90] how to find free parking.
[2192.90 → 2194.94] It was hard for him to verbalize it,
[2194.94 → 2198.38] but deep down we knew he loved us.
[2198.38 → 2200.54] In 1976, he took a trip to Europe
[2200.54 → 2203.14] that would change the course of his life.
[2203.14 → 2205.38] As part of a tour group in the UK,
[2205.38 → 2210.18] he met his future wife, Kathy, from Hong Kong.
[2210.18 → 2212.42] They would go on to travel other countries in Europe,
[2212.42 → 2217.96] and later Asia, and kept in contact by mail.
[2217.96 → 2220.06] Some time later, my mom moved to Canada,
[2220.06 → 2223.72] and they married in 1981.
[2223.72 → 2228.06] And I arrived nine months later to the day.
[2228.06 → 2235.40] My sister followed 19 months later.
[2235.40 → 2237.80] In 2016, he was blessed with the arrival
[2237.80 → 2240.44] of his sole grandchild, Nora.
[2240.44 → 2242.60] He was especially fond of her,
[2242.60 → 2246.42] even when she had a tendency to tell him what to do.
[2246.42 → 2251.02] But OPA loved you very much, Nora.
[2251.02 → 2254.96] Dad liked a cup of tea and a chocolate chip cookie.
[2254.96 → 2257.48] I can't remember a day that he didn't have one of those
[2257.48 → 2259.56] or both of those two things.
[2259.56 → 2261.76] He would often choose a Gouda sandwich
[2261.76 → 2266.24] over things that were exponentially more delicious.
[2266.24 → 2268.84] He loved to bargain, and garage sales
[2268.84 → 2272.68] were a long-time Saturday ritual of his.
[2272.68 → 2275.78] He loved to take care of his lawn and garden.
[2275.78 → 2278.24] He would water it several times a day,
[2278.24 → 2281.58] even during the height of water restrictions,
[2281.58 → 2284.52] much to the dismay of my mom.
[2284.52 → 2286.88] And he was eternally dedicated to eliminating
[2286.88 → 2289.96] the scourge of clover from his lawn,
[2289.96 → 2293.66] also to the dismay of my mom.
[2293.66 → 2297.36] He had a habit of doing a task with his tongue hanging out,
[2297.36 → 2301.68] a trait I later learned he inherited from his mother.
[2301.68 → 2305.54] During the late 80s, early 90s golden age,
[2305.54 → 2310.42] he fostered our interest in the World Wrestling Federation.
[2310.42 → 2313.18] My sister and I would practice finishing moves
[2313.18 → 2318.02] on each other and a full-size Papa Smurf doll.
[2318.02 → 2321.72] Evelyn usually won.
[2321.72 → 2326.12] When we had outgrown it, I would still find him watching.
[2326.12 → 2329.56] Oh, it's just a bunch of BS, he would say.
[2329.56 → 2333.46] Yet he remained tuned in until the end.
[2333.46 → 2336.98] And somehow he thought that a slow-cooked pork liver
[2336.98 → 2339.54] was something to bring to a party.
[2339.54 → 2346.54] Of all the delicious cuts on a pig, Dad, why the liver?
[2346.54 → 2348.22] Well, if an animal eats another animal,
[2348.22 → 2353.08] the first thing they go for is the liver.
[2353.08 → 2356.46] He was very proud of his Dutch heritage.
[2356.46 → 2360.70] A Dutchman is the only one who can buy from a Scot,
[2360.70 → 2365.20] sell to a Jew, and still make money, he would say.
[2365.20 → 2369.80] And that two Dutchmen were responsible for inventing copper wire,
[2369.80 → 2374.38] fighting over a penny.
[2374.38 → 2376.18] We learned about the Dutch Golden Age
[2376.18 → 2378.92] and how at one time the centre of world trade and commerce
[2378.92 → 2382.48] ran not through London or Paris, but Amsterdam,
[2382.48 → 2385.62] that tiny country by the North Sea
[2385.62 → 2390.92] that punched far above its weight in world affairs and global reach.
[2390.92 → 2393.46] One of my fondest memories of him in the later years
[2393.46 → 2396.20] was singing the Dutch national anthem
[2396.20 → 2399.40] prior to a Dutch national team soccer game
[2399.40 → 2405.30] or following one of Max Verstappen's many Formula One victories.
[2405.30 → 2409.30] Thank you for instilling in me a sense of faith,
[2409.30 → 2417.74] of family, of gratitude, of hard work, and of self-sacrifice.
[2417.74 → 2421.24] For humbling yourself to work low-paying jobs
[2421.24 → 2425.62] in order to give the best to your kids.
[2425.62 → 2429.68] Dad, I'm sorry the Nazis took away your childhood,
[2429.68 → 2435.86] your education, your opportunity.
[2435.86 → 2437.86] I wish I could have made it different for you.
[2437.86 → 2449.74] In Revelations 21, 5, it says, God says,
[2449.74 → 2453.24] Behold, I am making all things new.
[2453.24 → 2457.24] Like I told you in my final goodbye,
[2457.24 → 2459.74] there are no Nazis in heaven.
[2459.74 → 2462.86] Just be prepared to meet a few Germans.
[2462.86 → 2467.00] Say hi to OPA and OMA and all the other Bart's
[2467.00 → 2469.24] who have gone on before.
[2469.24 → 2471.14] We love you, Dad.
[2471.14 → 2473.04] We will miss you.
[2473.04 → 2475.54] Walter RUSTA, sleep well.
[2475.54 → 2492.42] Thank you, Johann.
[2492.42 → 2498.42] I don't want to call you a liar or anything,
[2498.42 → 2504.60] but this thing about stubbornness, it's hereditary.
[2504.60 → 2508.36] And so it goes way back in the Bart family
[2508.36 → 2510.70] because my mother used to tell a story
[2510.70 → 2515.20] of a couple in Holland, Bart's, who when they fought,
[2515.20 → 2518.50] would stop talking to each other.
[2518.50 → 2521.92] And every time they fought, they're not talking to each other,
[2521.92 → 2524.74] became longer and longer and longer.
[2524.74 → 2529.52] And it wouldn't come up to being even days before they would talk.
[2529.52 → 2531.84] And the secret was to make sure the other one talked first
[2531.84 → 2535.96] and then you won the battle.
[2535.96 → 2537.86] That's what I'm saying, it's hereditary, Johann.
[2537.86 → 2541.72] Believe me, trust me, just believe me.
[2541.72 → 2546.60] So what happened was this couple, Bart family,
[2546.60 → 2549.96] didn't talk to each other for seven days or whatever.
[2549.96 → 2553.40] It was just ridiculously long.
[2553.40 → 2556.10] And in order to get her to talk first,
[2556.10 → 2558.28] he got up from the kitchen table,
[2558.28 → 2560.94] went and opened every cupboard in the kitchen,
[2560.94 → 2565.58] took out every pot and pan and dish and plate and bowl
[2565.58 → 2568.32] and spoon and fork and knife and utensil
[2568.32 → 2572.02] and was placing them all on wherever he had space.
[2572.02 → 2575.28] And finally she said, what are you looking for?
[2575.28 → 2578.16] And he said, I found it.
[2578.16 → 2579.20] Your tongue.
[2579.20 → 2585.88] So Johann, it could be hereditary for some of you.
[2585.88 → 2587.98] I mean, I'm okay, but...
[2587.98 → 2596.18] We found Mike to be so stubborn that he lived longer
[2596.18 → 2598.32] than anybody in the Bart family that we know about.
[2598.32 → 2602.96] Even his father at 88 was, we thought, pretty old.
[2602.96 → 2609.24] But here he was, two years longer than his dad before he passed.
[2609.24 → 2611.84] Yet his life wasn't all that easy either,
[2611.84 → 2614.38] when, as Johann said, he had to go through war.
[2614.38 → 2616.04] And then when he came to Canada,
[2616.04 → 2619.44] here's a young man of 16 years of age or so,
[2619.44 → 2623.42] not speaking the language, not having gone to school here
[2623.42 → 2625.28] to speed that all up.
[2625.28 → 2629.66] And the family lived in southern Alberta as immigrants
[2629.66 → 2635.12] with seven sisters and five brothers in his case.
[2635.12 → 2639.22] And all they could do is work in places, in farms, as farmhand.
[2639.22 → 2642.40] They were living in sort of farm cottages
[2642.40 → 2645.90] and working in sugar beets, basically.
[2645.90 → 2649.64] And that means in the springtime, first you prune,
[2649.64 → 2651.94] make sure that there's not too many plants beside each other
[2651.94 → 2654.88] because the sugar beets get to be pretty big,
[2654.88 → 2658.42] and hole up the dirt against them and take out any weeds.
[2658.42 → 2661.82] And then when it was harvest time with huge machete knives,
[2661.82 → 2665.78] you put the pitchfork into it, lifted it out of the ground,
[2665.78 → 2670.22] chopped off the root, and waited until the tractor would come
[2670.22 → 2675.06] and pick up to take the plant to the refinery.
[2675.06 → 2677.06] And then in the winter, there wasn't much work to do.
[2677.06 → 2679.44] So what they did is they worked pretty hard
[2679.44 → 2683.74] in the cold Alberta South, pick up rocks out of the farmer's field
[2683.74 → 2686.38] of all different sizes and put them in a tractor
[2686.38 → 2688.38] that would go in front of you at high speed
[2688.38 → 2690.78] and you'd be trying to fill up all the rocks
[2690.78 → 2691.92] and get rid of all of them.
[2691.92 → 2695.16] So that part of his life was not easy
[2695.16 → 2698.60] and certainly not a blessing.
[2698.60 → 2700.60] And then over time, the family moved more and more
[2700.60 → 2702.40] to British Columbia.
[2702.40 → 2705.24] And so we would go for holidays to visit the people
[2705.24 → 2708.24] who lived in British Columbia, and that's what he did as well,
[2708.24 → 2712.54] and ended up staying in Number 5 Road with the Vanderhoek family,
[2712.54 → 2715.18] his sister and her husband.
[2715.18 → 2717.18] And he ended up working at the same place
[2717.18 → 2720.58] where her husband worked at BC Packers,
[2720.58 → 2722.62] which sounds familiar to me.
[2722.62 → 2726.92] And there he worked in the cold storage
[2726.92 → 2733.26] and fell very badly and really bashed his elbow ridiculously hard.
[2733.26 → 2737.56] And it was meaning he could not work, but he wasn't getting compensated
[2737.56 → 2740.20] for it in any way, shape or form.
[2740.20 → 2742.80] A lot of pain, heavy painkillers.
[2742.80 → 2747.20] Many times, Mom had trouble waking him up from the pain that he was in.
[2747.20 → 2748.80] And it was no relief.
[2748.80 → 2753.32] And Workman's Compensation Board would not pay for pain and discomfort
[2753.32 → 2755.62] was the reason they wouldn't do it.
[2755.62 → 2762.56] And so we contacted the local Richmond MLA, and he tried, and that didn't help.
[2762.56 → 2766.56] In the meantime, he wasn't really working, and he wasn't really doing anything
[2766.56 → 2768.96] and having a difficult time of it.
[2768.96 → 2775.28] But finally, fortunately, he got an operation on his arm that did fix the problem,
[2775.28 → 2778.48] but he'd had it for so long where you're protecting yourself
[2778.48 → 2781.78] that he wouldn't use his arm at all.
[2781.78 → 2786.26] And fortunately, a brother-in-law, Yip Fenestra, was a plumber
[2786.26 → 2788.22] and was behind badly on the job.
[2788.22 → 2790.72] And one day come over and says, Mike, you've got to help me.
[2790.72 → 2791.70] You've got to.
[2791.70 → 2794.90] I know you can only use one hand, but even if you just take some of the pipe
[2794.90 → 2798.90] from the van and bring it to the house, that'll be enough to give me a chance
[2798.90 → 2800.20] to get more done.
[2800.20 → 2803.90] And so Mike did that for a week.
[2803.90 → 2804.94] That became two weeks.
[2804.94 → 2805.90] That became three weeks.
[2805.90 → 2808.84] It became a long-time permanent job.
[2808.84 → 2813.70] But even before that, Mike wanted to do things better in life,
[2813.70 → 2816.12] and so he could not work.
[2816.12 → 2817.02] So he thought, well, you know what I'll do?
[2817.02 → 2820.84] I'll rent some property in a barn and buy calves and raise the calves
[2820.84 → 2824.88] from nothing till their cows and then sell them off and make money.
[2824.88 → 2828.16] So I remember many times being his younger brother,
[2828.72 → 2832.26] mom forcing me to go with him, take out the backseat of the car,
[2832.26 → 2835.42] go to the auction, buy a bunch of calves,
[2835.42 → 2837.36] put them in the back where the backseat was,
[2837.36 → 2840.00] and carry them over to the barn.
[2840.00 → 2847.04] And having this warm breath on your neck while you're sitting in the front of a car
[2847.04 → 2850.04] with the backseat out was not a lot of fun.
[2850.04 → 2854.68] And it really also was terrible before we put the van's seats back in
[2854.68 → 2856.88] because you had to clean the backseat up.
[2856.88 → 2858.32] Well, you know what I mean.
[2858.32 → 2862.32] So at any rate, that was part of what he tried to do to get things going.
[2862.32 → 2867.86] But when he finally did get the job with his plumbing, it made a big difference.
[2867.86 → 2870.16] He was able to make a beautiful trip on a holiday,
[2870.16 → 2873.66] went on this cruise and met a beautiful woman on this cruise,
[2873.66 → 2876.10] which he didn't say much about to anybody in the family.
[2876.10 → 2882.54] But it was really neat that Mike loved kids well before he ever even got married,
[2882.54 → 2886.24] to the point where our brother George, who lived in the east coast of Canada,
[2886.24 → 2890.04] had, his wife had medical difficulties and needed help.
[2890.04 → 2894.68] And so he flew to Vancouver and dropped off his little baby boy at mom and dad's,
[2894.68 → 2898.18] dad's garden, Ian Bart.
[2898.18 → 2902.28] And Mike would see this little, little kid walking around.
[2902.28 → 2904.90] And Mike and him got pretty close.
[2904.90 → 2908.80] And he's over here shaking his head, acknowledging that it would happen.
[2908.80 → 2913.74] Mike would have his sweater on, his brown sweater on, as usual.
[2913.74 → 2916.90] And he put on his coat, put on his hat.
[2916.90 → 2920.40] And Ian would be anxious to see where he's going.
[2920.40 → 2922.10] He said, well, I think I'm going to go to the garden.
[2922.10 → 2925.50] And then Mike would take him to dad's garden.
[2925.50 → 2930.28] And they would go and harvest some red currants, black currants,
[2930.28 → 2933.78] either gooseberries, blueberries, or raspberries.
[2933.78 → 2937.82] But all of those things Ian loved so much that when, I mean,
[2937.82 → 2941.46] I remember once walking with Mike saying, Mike, watch this, watch this.
[2941.46 → 2945.16] And we went outside and Ian had this beautiful strawberry.
[2945.16 → 2950.20] And he just went, ooh, that's just so, so good.
[2950.20 → 2951.20] It was fun.
[2951.20 → 2955.60] And Mike just loved taking them outside to enjoy doing that.
[2955.60 → 2960.14] So he loved children, even though he didn't have a wife and any kids of his own.
[2960.14 → 2963.48] But then he had the pleasure of meeting Kathy on a tour.
[2963.48 → 2966.18] And that changed his life forever.
[2966.18 → 2973.38] And one of the best joyous days of our family's life was after we saw that his arm was being used.
[2973.38 → 2976.78] And he was making money and doing work.
[2976.78 → 2980.68] He was able to get married and start a family of his own.
[2980.68 → 2987.82] And it was a beautiful time for us as a Barth family to see all of this happening, happening to him.
[2987.82 → 3002.16] And the wedding was special compared to all the other weddings in our family because our other brother was with a woman who was a sort of music choreographer, I guess, or whatever you call her.
[3002.16 → 3006.56] And all the grandkids were all dressed up.
[3006.56 → 3009.50] And the song was, it's a small world after all.
[3009.50 → 3016.60] And everybody was running through this whole church meeting hall where we were having the wedding.
[3016.60 → 3020.44] And all these kids were having such a good, beautiful time.
[3020.44 → 3031.44] And it was such a joyous, happy occasion to see this brother who had gone through a lot of difficulties with his work, with his arm, with being a bachelor for so long.
[3031.44 → 3035.56] And now you can see that he was married and having a good, good time of it.
[3035.56 → 3037.46] And the family was so happy.
[3037.46 → 3040.46] And that went on for a number of years.
[3040.46 → 3044.76] And then this old tough guy just got older than anybody else in the family.
[3044.76 → 3048.26] And finally ended up passing away.
[3048.26 → 3052.00] And it was sad to see his last days.
[3052.00 → 3055.86] But it was very comforting to know that he was married to a nurse.
[3055.86 → 3061.80] And I guess that was part of his plan as well, to be sure that he was covered further in the last days.
[3061.80 → 3064.02] And it was just so well.
[3064.02 → 3069.56] He could see you, and he could listen to you, but he couldn't speak anymore.
[3069.56 → 3071.72] And he was very comfortable.
[3071.72 → 3077.22] And we were saying, well, after standing around the bed for a little while, we were going to have to go, Mike.
[3077.22 → 3083.72] So my wife, Tina, says to him, well, Mike, we're going, but we'll be praying for you.
[3083.72 → 3090.72] And all he could do was lift his skinny arm and acknowledge what she had said.
[3090.72 → 3101.72] It was a great moment of comfort to see that he could hear you clearly and that we know that even though it was near his last days,
[3101.72 → 3104.72] and he did live two more days, but then he finally did leave us.
[3104.72 → 3111.72] So we're very grateful for the family and for his wife that he had and his children.
[3111.72 → 3117.72] And we're so grateful that you're all here to help remember his life that he had lived.
[3117.72 → 3120.72] And we thank you all for coming and being a part of it.
[3120.72 → 3123.72] And thank you so much for that.
[3123.72 → 3129.72] We were so grateful that his wife, who was a nurse, could help him in his last final days.
[3129.72 → 3144.72] And if you put it all together, that tough, old, stubborn guy lived to be roughly 33,000 days on earth.
[3144.72 → 3150.72] And now our comfort comes to knowing that he's not counting the days anymore.
[3150.72 → 3153.72] They don't matter, but it's going to be well past 33,000.
[3153.72 → 3155.72] And we're so grateful for that.
[3155.72 → 3162.72] And thank you all again for taking time to listen to us talk about a brother who we love dearly,
[3162.72 → 3164.72] who's no longer with us.
[3164.72 → 3166.72] But thank you all.
[3183.72 → 3184.72] Thank you all.
[3213.72 → 3214.72] Thank you.
[3243.72 → 3244.72] Thank you.
[3273.72 → 3274.72] Thank you.
[3303.72 → 3304.72] Thank you.
[3333.72 → 3334.72] Thank you.
[3363.72 → 3364.72] Thank you.
[3393.72 → 3394.72] Thank you.
[3394.72 → 3395.72] Thank you.
[3423.72 → 3424.72] Thank you.
[3453.72 → 3454.72] Thank you.
[3454.72 → 3455.72] Thank you.
[3483.72 → 3484.72] Thank you.
[3484.72 → 3485.72] Thank you.
[3513.72 → 3538.72] So that was a wonderful slideshow.
[3538.72 → 3545.88] And thank you, Mike and Ike and Johan for sharing those memories.
[3546.26 → 3547.02] Let's all stand.
[3547.32 → 3550.92] And next we're going to sing another song together, Abide With Me.
[3551.06 → 3552.44] So let's rise and we'll sing.
[3568.72 → 3570.72] Amen.
[3598.72 → 3617.48] The darkness deepens, Lord, in me abide.
[3617.48 → 3629.18] And other helpers, heal and comforts lead.
[3629.94 → 3640.92] Help, how the helpless soul abide with me.
[3640.92 → 3662.58] A STEPH comes, Lord, in me.

[3762.58 → 3771.48] And North Sea shallow stream,
[3772.38 → 3783.48] In Converse and elevation,
[3783.48 → 3798.46] You may be seated.
[3806.20 → 3812.30] So we're going to read a passage from the Bible to guide us as we remember the life of Mike Barth.
[3812.30 → 3814.08] And it's a very familiar passage.
[3814.34 → 3816.00] It comes from Psalm 23.
[3816.84 → 3819.04] And I will read it for us.
[3819.20 → 3825.20] And it was requested to be read from the Old King James Version, which is the version that many of us will know.
[3827.22 → 3830.78] Now, the words are also printed on the back of your bulletin.
[3830.88 → 3833.38] They'll also be on the screens.
[3835.24 → 3838.48] So let's give our attention to this reading of Psalm 23.
[3838.48 → 3841.00] The Lord is my shepherd.
[3841.00 → 3842.64] I lack nothing.
[3843.22 → 3845.72] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[3846.04 → 3848.46] He leads me beside quiet waters.
[3848.94 → 3850.20] He refreshes my soul.
[3852.20 → 3853.14] Sorry, I was reading.
[3853.24 → 3855.30] Okay, I'll stick with the words on the screen here.
[3855.70 → 3857.02] He restored my soul.
[3857.28 → 3861.52] He leader me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[3861.52 → 3868.92] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[3869.48 → 3872.10] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[3873.14 → 3876.24] Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
[3876.92 → 3878.88] Thou anointest my head with oil.
[3879.36 → 3880.76] My cup runner over.
[3880.76 → 3885.72] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[3885.94 → 3889.50] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[3892.22 → 3893.28] Would you pray with me?
[3893.28 → 3902.12] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that in Psalm 23, you tell us, Lord, who we are as your sheep.
[3902.74 → 3906.48] You tell us who you are as our good shepherd.
[3907.32 → 3908.98] And Father, would you show us Jesus.
[3909.92 → 3915.26] Help us, Lord, to fix our eyes on him as we consider this psalm, that we might receive your comfort.
[3915.26 → 3917.82] We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3919.28 → 3923.96] So, this psalm, of course, begins with these very familiar, very comforting words.
[3924.06 → 3927.16] The Lord is my shepherd.
[3927.94 → 3934.42] And there are a few phrases that are more familiar and comforting to the Christian.
[3935.70 → 3942.26] You know, Psalm 23 is often one of the very first passages that we learn by heart as a young child.
[3942.26 → 3947.06] And it's among the last words that many of us will say as we depart this life.
[3947.48 → 3955.44] When I visited Mike just, I think, two days before he died, we read Psalm 23 together.
[3956.30 → 3962.64] And he, although wasn't able to talk very well, was still reciting it with me.
[3962.86 → 3965.66] You know, just moving his mouth and following along.
[3968.26 → 3972.10] And because of this, it gives us such a vivid portrait, a picture.
[3972.26 → 3972.62] Right?
[3972.74 → 3976.52] Of sheep and shepherds and green meadows and rivers.
[3977.00 → 3978.14] All of these things.
[3978.38 → 3980.70] And it gives us this picture of the Lord's care for us.
[3981.40 → 3985.66] And that's why it's one of the best passages that we can turn to for comfort and for hope.
[3986.36 → 3990.14] And that's why it's good for us to ponder these words for just a few moments together.
[3990.90 → 3993.58] So, I want us to look briefly through this passage.
[3994.06 → 3998.56] And just see what it teaches us about the Lord who is our shepherd.
[3998.56 → 4001.04] And so, it begins again.
[4001.16 → 4002.24] The Lord is my shepherd.
[4002.80 → 4006.64] And what it is, it's a picture of God and who he is.
[4007.26 → 4008.86] Again, that gives us so much comfort.
[4009.38 → 4011.76] But at the same time, it is not meant to be cute.
[4012.24 → 4013.88] It's not meant to be just sentimental.
[4013.88 → 4023.72] Because when David, the author of this psalm, when he wrote it, the image he had in mind of a shepherd was not just like a gentle, soft character.
[4024.22 → 4025.62] But it was the image of a king.
[4026.54 → 4032.26] And so, in the ancient world, a king would call himself the shepherd of his people.
[4032.26 → 4037.82] And so, when we say the Lord is my shepherd, we're saying the Lord is my king.
[4039.26 → 4041.40] And as a king, what does the Lord do?
[4041.52 → 4043.02] Well, he protects us.
[4043.44 → 4044.84] He provides for us.
[4044.90 → 4047.22] He cares for us as his people.
[4048.18 → 4050.98] And that's what we see in these first few verses of the psalm.
[4050.98 → 4059.20] Where, as our shepherd, the Lord knows that we often, as sheep, don't know what is good for us to eat.
[4059.72 → 4064.24] Sometimes we go, and we eat plants that are poisonous or that will harm us.
[4064.82 → 4069.42] But our shepherd, he guides us to green pastures.
[4070.54 → 4075.44] Our shepherd knows that we might try to drink from a river that is flowing too fast.
[4075.50 → 4077.20] And we might fall in and be swept away.
[4077.62 → 4080.66] So, our shepherd, he leads us to gentle waters.
[4081.98 → 4084.92] We often don't know the best way to go.
[4085.68 → 4086.90] We often get lost.
[4087.34 → 4088.14] We often wander.
[4089.20 → 4092.16] But our shepherd leads us on good paths.
[4093.32 → 4095.10] And that's the opening scene that we have.
[4095.16 → 4102.36] It's a picture of God as a shepherd king watching over us, providing for us, tending us.
[4103.44 → 4109.32] But then, the second scene is often the one that we think of most often when we think of Psalm 23.
[4109.32 → 4111.02] Verse 4 says,
[4111.02 → 4118.70] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[4119.38 → 4121.36] Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[4122.34 → 4135.52] And so here, Psalm 23, it describes how the shepherd would lead the sheep on a journey from the green meadows and the babbling brooks of this low country up to a higher pasture.
[4135.52 → 4142.50] But to get there, the shepherd must lead the sheep through a dark valley.
[4143.48 → 4147.00] And in this dark valley, the path gets hard and rocky.
[4147.26 → 4154.42] There are many dangers of maybe bandits, wild animals lurking in the shadows, ready to devour the sheep.
[4154.42 → 4162.10] And David, in this metaphor, he sees this valley as the Christian's passage through death.
[4163.38 → 4172.94] And even though each one of us will have to walk through this valley one day, we have many reasons not to be afraid.
[4173.98 → 4175.22] What are some of those reasons?
[4175.22 → 4179.62] Well, one is that our Lord, it says, leads us through the valley.
[4180.20 → 4183.34] He doesn't just lead us into it and there to remain.
[4183.50 → 4185.04] He leads us through it.
[4185.68 → 4193.60] And it's a wonderful thing for us to know that this valley of the shadow of death, it comes in the middle of Psalm 23.
[4194.06 → 4195.38] It doesn't come at the end.
[4196.66 → 4199.88] And what that means is that death is not our final destination.
[4199.88 → 4205.02] According to God's word, Mike has not passed into death.
[4205.70 → 4211.28] He has passed through death into the land where his good shepherd has led him.
[4212.62 → 4217.08] Another thing of comfort to notice is the way this valley is described.
[4217.24 → 4221.54] It's described as the valley of the shadow of death.
[4222.82 → 4225.02] And that still sounds a little frightening.
[4225.02 → 4232.72] But as frightening as death is, it really is but a shadow.
[4234.04 → 4237.56] And truly, we grieve the reality of death.
[4237.68 → 4240.82] Death affects us profoundly deep.
[4241.12 → 4242.32] Death is the enemy.
[4242.54 → 4246.28] It's an offence, a way that God made this good world.
[4247.08 → 4253.96] And so it is right for us to grieve and to feel sadness when someone we love is taken away from us.
[4253.96 → 4256.42] It's not the way God made the world to be.
[4257.28 → 4261.60] But the good news is that Jesus has removed the sting from death.
[4261.66 → 4264.82] Just as we sang earlier, where, O death, is your sting?
[4265.56 → 4269.06] It has been removed by Jesus through his death and his resurrection.
[4269.58 → 4272.48] And what that means is that death can no longer harm us.
[4275.10 → 4277.26] Jesus has conquered death forever.
[4277.78 → 4281.04] So that when we belong to him, death cannot harm us.
[4281.08 → 4281.86] It is but a shadow.
[4281.86 → 4284.98] And then finally, why do we not have to be afraid?
[4286.18 → 4288.04] Well, it's because we are never alone.
[4288.78 → 4289.72] We're never alone.
[4289.80 → 4291.48] We don't walk this valley on our own.
[4291.82 → 4295.12] But we journey through it with our shepherd with us.
[4296.06 → 4301.20] And so we believe and know that when Mike passed through that valley of the shadow of death,
[4301.24 → 4303.38] as we all will, he was not alone.
[4303.90 → 4305.76] Because Jesus was with him.
[4306.48 → 4308.12] And we can take great comfort in that.
[4308.12 → 4313.02] And that's why it says, I will fear no evil.
[4314.20 → 4314.72] Why?
[4315.22 → 4316.58] Because you are with me.
[4317.16 → 4318.06] You're with me.
[4318.76 → 4322.06] You know, when we feel afraid, we want someone by our side.
[4323.30 → 4325.26] And Jesus is always by our side.
[4325.26 → 4328.92] Now, finally, the psalm ends in this very beautiful way.
[4329.12 → 4333.00] Because after we pass through this valley of the shadow of death, it's not the end.
[4333.30 → 4337.30] The shepherd leads us to the place that he has prepared for us.
[4338.42 → 4341.24] Verse 6, at the end, simply says,
[4341.24 → 4358.48] And the reason that we will be able to dwell in the house of the Lord forever is not because of who we are as sheep.
[4358.48 → 4363.72] If you know anything about sheep, they are not the most brave creatures.
[4364.50 → 4368.72] They're not the most wise or strong or skilled.
[4369.50 → 4371.90] In fact, they're known for not being any of those things.
[4372.70 → 4375.38] Sheep are often the weakest and most vulnerable of animals.
[4376.32 → 4382.34] And so it's not who we are as sheep to kind of earn our way into this good pasture.
[4383.22 → 4385.68] But it's rather who our shepherd is.
[4386.62 → 4387.70] It's who our shepherd is.
[4387.70 → 4391.66] In Jesus, in the Gospel of John, he said,
[4392.08 → 4394.00] I am the good shepherd.
[4395.02 → 4396.62] He says, I know my sheep.
[4396.72 → 4397.92] My sheep know me.
[4398.00 → 4398.86] There's a relationship.
[4399.98 → 4402.82] I lay down my life for the sheep.
[4403.34 → 4406.36] I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish.
[4406.86 → 4409.24] No one will snatch them out of my hand.
[4409.82 → 4411.64] See, our good shepherd is strong.
[4412.32 → 4413.98] Our good shepherd is wise.
[4413.98 → 4417.02] And he is the one who laid down his life for us.
[4417.70 → 4420.34] And Mike had this hope.
[4420.74 → 4421.74] A strong hope.
[4422.08 → 4424.62] That he would dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[4424.96 → 4426.46] Not because of who he was.
[4426.66 → 4429.24] But because of who Jesus is.
[4429.84 → 4431.40] That Jesus is our good shepherd.
[4432.16 → 4434.38] Jesus says, he knows the sheep.
[4434.88 → 4436.68] And his sheep know him.
[4436.68 → 4442.34] And so friends, do you know Jesus as your good shepherd?
[4443.54 → 4444.48] As Mike did.
[4445.84 → 4451.28] He's the good shepherd who laid down his life for his sheep so that we could dwell with him forever.
[4451.28 → 4453.24] As we put our faith in him.
[4453.94 → 4460.30] Friends, that is why Psalm 23 is the psalm that we say right at death's door.
[4460.74 → 4463.42] Because it reminds us of what is true.
[4464.08 → 4466.54] That our shepherd loves us.
[4466.68 → 4467.68] That he is with us.
[4467.92 → 4469.88] That he is bringing us to dwell with him.
[4469.88 → 4471.58] So let's pray.
[4475.66 → 4482.40] Oh Lord, we thank you for these words of Psalm 23 that have been a comfort.
[4483.20 → 4490.74] A source of your truth and your love to countless believers throughout the ages.
[4490.74 → 4494.80] We thank you, Lord, that Mike was a sheep of your own flock.
[4494.92 → 4497.48] That you knew him and that he knew you.
[4498.08 → 4500.10] That he was a lamb of your own choosing.
[4500.84 → 4506.80] That he was a sinner who had been redeemed by the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4507.66 → 4509.62] And Lord, we thank you that you are the good shepherd.
[4509.76 → 4512.66] You are the shepherd king who cares for us.
[4513.56 → 4515.16] And knows what is good for us.
[4515.22 → 4516.86] And leads us in the way that we should go.
[4517.52 → 4519.32] And Lord, as we reflect on these things.
[4519.32 → 4526.20] Lord, would you use these words to comfort us and to help us, Lord, to turn in faith to you.
[4526.74 → 4529.90] So that each one of us could say, the Lord is my shepherd.
[4530.76 → 4533.14] And to know the assurance that we belong to you.
[4533.58 → 4534.76] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4535.52 → 4535.86] Amen.
[4541.56 → 4544.00] Okay, so we will stand.
[4544.62 → 4546.50] And we will sing together another hymn.
[4547.18 → 4548.40] Precious Lord, take my hand.
[4548.40 → 4550.10] So let's stand and sing together.
[4550.10 → 4550.22] Amen.
[4550.22 → 4550.40] Amen.
[4578.40 → 4581.14] So let's stand.
[4581.24 → 4582.56] Bitter.
[4582.56 → 4588.42] Amen.
[4588.42 → 4590.24] Thank you.
[4590.66 → 4592.52] The Lord.
[4593.78 → 4595.76] We're in love.
[4595.78 → 4598.78] I am one.
[4598.78 → 4601.42] I am one.
[4601.42 → 4605.66] I am born.
[4607.18 → 4611.46] In the storm, through the time,
[4611.80 → 4615.98] give me all to the light.
[4616.50 → 4620.94] In my hand, precious Lord,
[4621.40 → 4623.66] give me hope.
[4623.66 → 4630.98] In the people's dear,
[4631.28 → 4633.66] precious Lord,
[4633.66 → 4635.96] give me here,
[4636.32 → 4643.90] where my life is almost gone.
[4645.46 → 4648.14] Fear my pride,
[4648.14 → 4650.46] fear my fall,
[4650.46 → 4655.74] for my hand, yes, I call.
[4656.26 → 4661.54] In my hand, precious Lord,
[4661.80 → 4664.46] give me hope.
[4667.46 → 4671.58] The darkness of grace
[4671.58 → 4675.46] at the valley cross me,
[4675.46 → 4685.46] when the day is past and night.
[4686.46 → 4690.46] At the river I stand,
[4690.46 → 4693.46] at my feet,
[4693.46 → 4696.80] hold my hand,
[4697.12 → 4699.78] take my hand,
[4700.26 → 4702.88] precious Lord,
[4703.20 → 4705.46] give me hope.
[4705.46 → 4706.12] Amen.
[4714.26 → 4715.70] You can remain standing,
[4715.98 → 4716.82] and let's pray.
[4717.98 → 4719.32] Lord, we thank you,
[4719.44 → 4720.82] and we praise you for your promises,
[4721.04 → 4722.40] that through faith in Jesus,
[4722.52 → 4723.00] our Saviour,
[4723.66 → 4726.10] we have an unshakeable assurance
[4726.10 → 4727.20] of eternal life.
[4727.78 → 4729.38] We have the hope that one day
[4729.38 → 4730.34] Christ will return
[4730.34 → 4731.92] and will destroy death forever,
[4731.92 → 4734.24] and as we were reminded earlier,
[4734.84 → 4736.10] he will make all things new.
[4737.18 → 4738.04] And so we thank you
[4738.04 → 4739.10] that our brother,
[4739.54 → 4739.82] Michael,
[4740.00 → 4741.52] even now lives in your presence
[4741.52 → 4742.66] in the fullness of joy,
[4743.14 → 4744.64] and in your great love,
[4744.72 → 4746.48] you have prepared a place for him,
[4746.82 → 4748.14] and you have welcomed him
[4748.14 → 4749.36] into your arms of mercy.
[4750.30 → 4751.12] And in that, Lord,
[4751.18 → 4751.90] we rejoice,
[4752.72 → 4753.94] we take great comfort.
[4754.80 → 4755.14] And Lord,
[4755.20 → 4756.86] for all of those here
[4756.86 → 4758.30] who grieve this day,
[4758.30 → 4760.02] and who will grieve
[4760.02 → 4761.04] in the days to come,
[4761.20 → 4761.38] Lord,
[4761.42 → 4762.34] especially Kathy,
[4762.66 → 4763.00] Evelyn,
[4763.22 → 4764.12] and Johan,
[4764.18 → 4765.38] and all of Mike's family,
[4766.10 → 4766.30] Lord,
[4766.36 → 4767.28] would you draw near
[4767.28 → 4768.16] with your comfort
[4768.16 → 4770.50] and with your fatherly care.
[4771.10 → 4771.22] Lord,
[4771.28 → 4772.18] give us a quiet
[4772.18 → 4774.64] and a confident faith
[4774.64 → 4776.10] in our good shepherd
[4776.10 → 4776.82] who promises
[4776.82 → 4777.88] to be with us always.
[4778.72 → 4780.14] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4780.54 → 4780.86] Amen.
[4782.42 → 4783.22] So now,
[4783.40 → 4784.54] as we prepare
[4784.54 → 4786.10] to depart,
[4786.30 → 4786.88] would you receive
[4786.88 → 4787.62] this benediction?
[4788.30 → 4789.42] The Lord bless you
[4789.42 → 4790.08] and keep you.
[4790.48 → 4792.38] The Lord lift his face
[4792.38 → 4793.04] upon you
[4793.04 → 4794.06] and be gracious to you.
[4794.18 → 4794.90] The Lord lift
[4794.90 → 4796.10] his countenance upon you
[4796.10 → 4797.30] and give you peace.
[4797.68 → 4798.04] Amen.
[4799.16 → 4800.04] So we're going to
[4800.04 → 4801.02] remain standing
[4801.02 → 4802.32] and sing one final song.
[4802.72 → 4803.58] It's a Dutch song.
[4804.36 → 4804.76] And so,
[4805.14 → 4806.22] it's a good one to end with.
[4806.28 → 4806.66] Let's sing.
[4806.66 → 4806.76] Amen.
[4808.92 → 4809.26] Amen.
[4809.26 → 4809.66] Amen.
[4809.66 → 4809.76] Amen.
[4809.76 → 4809.86] Amen.
[4809.86 → 4809.92] Amen.
[4809.92 → 4810.12] Amen.
[4810.12 → 4810.24] Amen.
[4810.24 → 4810.72] Amen.
[4810.72 → 4810.80] Amen.
[4810.80 → 4811.32] Amen.
[4811.32 → 4811.34] Amen.
[4811.34 → 4811.76] Amen.
[4811.76 → 4811.80] Amen.
