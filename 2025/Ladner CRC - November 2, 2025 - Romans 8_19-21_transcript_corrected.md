[656.96 → 662.30] Okay, so with that, God calls us to worship this morning.
[662.44 → 664.36] He is the God of heaven and earth.
[665.62 → 671.28] And so we will use Psalm 148 as our call to confession this morning.
[671.84 → 673.72] And it's going to be a lot of responsive.
[674.14 → 675.98] We're going to do the whole thing back and forth.
[676.50 → 681.40] Okay, so get ready to join in and participate as we proclaim God's word together.
[682.06 → 682.88] Psalm 148.
[683.80 → 684.68] Praise the Lord.
[685.42 → 686.92] Praise the Lord from the heavens.
[687.64 → 689.42] Praise him in the heights above.
[690.62 → 692.44] Praise him, all his angels.
[693.20 → 695.70] Praise him, all his heavenly hosts.
[696.56 → 698.10] Praise him, sun and moon.
[698.72 → 700.80] Praise him, all you shining stars.
[701.76 → 706.58] Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.
[707.48 → 712.28] Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created.
[712.28 → 716.34] And he established them forever and ever.
[716.34 → 720.42] He issued a decree that will never pass away.
[720.80 → 722.82] Praise the Lord from the earth.
[722.82 → 726.04] You great sea creatures in all ocean depths.
[726.48 → 730.10] Lightning and hail, snow and clouds.
[730.46 → 733.14] Stormy winds that do his bidding.
[733.86 → 735.62] You mountains in all hills.
[735.62 → 738.28] Fruit trees in all cedars.
[738.28 → 741.30] Wild animals in all cattle.
[741.30 → 742.30] Small creatures in all animals.
[742.30 → 744.52] Small creatures in flying birds.
[744.52 → 747.16] Kings of the earth and all nations.
[747.16 → 749.76] You princes and all rulers on earth.
[749.76 → 752.18] Young men and women.
[752.18 → 754.20] Old men and children.
[754.20 → 756.68] Let them praise the name of the Lord.
[756.68 → 759.64] For his name alone is exalted.
[759.64 → 763.66] His splendour is above the earth and the heavens.
[763.66 → 765.44] Praise the Lord.
[767.12 → 773.24] Would you join me in a prayer of adoration as we praise our God this morning in prayer.
[774.38 → 783.96] Creator God, we praise you for your goodness and your grandeur that we see so readily in all of this world that you have made.
[783.96 → 787.04] Lord, the heavens declare your glory, O God.
[787.04 → 789.68] The skies proclaim the work of your hands.
[790.46 → 799.36] And as we continue to learn more of the vastness of your cosmos and even of the smallest particles of each atom,
[800.02 → 805.34] Lord, we stand in awe that you created all things in a great and harmonious design.
[806.26 → 809.94] Open our eyes and our ears that we may take delight in the beauty,
[809.94 → 818.02] in the variety of sky and of sea, of desert and mountain, of plants and flowers, of birds and fish,
[818.78 → 822.46] of all of your creatures, both large and small,
[823.24 → 826.86] and of humankind, the crown of your creation.
[827.76 → 830.46] Lord, we praise you for your majestic wonder,
[831.42 → 836.06] the majestic wonder of your creativity and of your tender care for all that you have made.
[836.88 → 839.08] And we thank you, Lord, for this day that you have made,
[839.08 → 843.88] a day when you have gathered us as your people to come before you and worship.
[844.76 → 852.18] Lord, would you be lifted high in our prayers and in our praises and in our hearts as we worship you.
[852.44 → 854.46] Help us to do so, Lord, in spirit and in truth.
[855.00 → 857.94] And together, all God's people said, amen.
[858.92 → 861.86] So now let's stand and let's hear God's greeting to us this morning.
[861.86 → 866.50] This comes from Our World Belongs to God,
[866.60 → 870.16] one of the contemporary testimonies of the Christian Reformed Church.
[870.88 → 872.62] And this is the words that says,
[873.54 → 875.68] God is king, let the earth be glad.
[876.22 → 878.96] Christ is victor, his rule has begun.
[879.52 → 880.80] The spirit is at work.
[881.44 → 882.72] Creation is renewed.
[883.30 → 883.70] Hallelujah.
[884.40 → 885.04] Praise the Lord.
[885.04 → 888.56] So God is, as God has called us and welcomed us,
[888.62 → 890.04] let's turn and let's greet one another.
[890.04 → 890.12] Amen.
[890.12 → 890.24] Amen.
[890.24 → 890.26] Amen.
[890.26 → 890.36] Amen.
[890.36 → 891.26] Amen.
[891.26 → 892.26] Amen.
[892.26 → 893.26] Amen.
[893.26 → 893.86] Amen.
[893.86 → 894.22] Amen.
[894.22 → 904.28] Amen.
[904.28 → 905.18] Amen.
[905.88 → 906.00] Amen.
[906.08 → 906.34] Amen.
[906.34 → 906.44] Amen.
[906.44 → 910.32] Amen.
[912.66 → 914.48] Amen.
[914.48 → 916.28] Amen.
[916.84 → 919.34] Amen.
[919.34 → 922.48] Amen.
[922.48 → 922.86] Amen.
[922.86 → 952.84] Thank you.
[952.86 → 969.86] This is my Father's Word, and to my listening ears, all nature sings and round he brings the music of the spirit.
[969.86 → 985.86] This is my Father's Word, I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees, of pleasant seas, as I am.
[985.86 → 1008.86] This is my Father's Word, the birds their carols blaze, the morning lights the Lilly, declare their maker's name.
[1008.86 → 1018.04] This is my Father's Word, He shines in all that's found.
[1018.58 → 1025.36] When the rustling glass, I hold it fast, speaks to me.
[1025.36 → 1039.36] This is my Father's Word, oh let me not forget.
[1039.36 → 1048.36] But all the ramps in top so strong, soon is the world of heaven.
[1049.36 → 1057.36] This is my Father's Word, why should my heart be sad?
[1057.36 → 1066.36] The Lord is king of the heavens, who may let the earth be blind.
[1066.36 → 1075.36] The Lord is king of the heavens, who may let the earth be blind.
[1075.36 → 1082.36] The Lord is king of the heavens, who may let the earth be blind.
[1082.36 → 1089.36] The Lord is king of the heavens, who may let the earth be blind.
[1089.36 → 1103.36] The Lord is king of the heavens, who may let the earth be blind.
[1103.36 → 1109.02] Sing together, give thanks to the Lord, our God and King.
[1109.02 → 1117.44] His love endures forever, for He is good, He is above all things.
[1117.78 → 1120.54] His love endures forever.
[1121.64 → 1128.30] Sing praise, sing the praise.
[1128.30 → 1136.96] With a mighty hand and outstretched arm, His love endures forever.
[1138.66 → 1145.30] For the life that's been reborn, His love endures forever.
[1145.30 → 1157.30] Sing praise, sing the praise, sing the praise.
[1158.30 → 1161.30] Sing praise, sing the praise.
[1162.92 → 1165.96] Forever God is faithful.
[1167.16 → 1169.96] Forever God is strong.
[1171.04 → 1174.92] Forever God is with us.
[1174.92 → 1180.46] Forever, forever.
[1180.46 → 1190.82] The rising to the setting sun, His love endures forever.
[1190.82 → 1196.06] Forever, by the grace of God, we will carry on.
[1196.40 → 1199.12] His love endures forever.
[1200.30 → 1206.38] Sing praise, sing praise.
[1206.38 → 1214.12] Sing praise, sing praise.
[1216.12 → 1219.82] Forever God is faithful.
[1220.94 → 1224.12] Forever God is strong.
[1224.12 → 1228.90] Forever God is with us.
[1228.90 → 1230.30] Forever God is faithful.
[1232.78 → 1242.96] Forever God is faithful.
[1242.96 → 1245.36] Forever God is strong.
[1245.36 → 1254.50] For God is with us forever, forever.
[1258.42 → 1260.48] Amen. You may be seated.
[1275.36 → 1282.86] Okay, so our first scripture reading comes from Psalm 8.
[1282.86 → 1283.66] Psalm 8.
[1284.44 → 1288.72] If you'd like to follow along in your pew Bible, it's on page 403.
[1290.02 → 1291.26] 403 in your pew Bible.
[1292.10 → 1293.80] Or you can follow along on the screen.
[1297.06 → 1299.78] So this is Psalm 8.
[1302.14 → 1302.72] It says,
[1302.72 → 1308.62] It's for the director of music according to Gothita, a Psalm of David.
[1309.62 → 1315.54] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[1316.12 → 1319.54] You have set your glory above the heavens.
[1319.94 → 1324.58] From the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise.
[1324.96 → 1328.82] Because of your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
[1328.82 → 1332.32] When I consider your heavens the work of your fingers,
[1332.72 → 1335.70] the moon and the stars which you have set in place.
[1336.22 → 1338.36] What is man that you are mindful of him?
[1338.82 → 1340.74] The son of man that you care for him.
[1341.32 → 1343.86] You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings
[1343.86 → 1345.80] and crowned him with glory and honour.
[1346.34 → 1349.86] You made him ruler over the works of your hands.
[1350.18 → 1351.94] You put everything under his feet.
[1352.44 → 1356.28] All flocks and herds and the beasts of the field,
[1356.38 → 1358.48] the birds of the air and the fish of the sea,
[1358.48 → 1361.36] all that swim the paths of the sea.
[1362.08 → 1367.54] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[1368.04 → 1369.30] This is the word of the Lord.
[1370.14 → 1371.20] Thanks be to God.
[1371.20 → 1382.70] So, you know, we can so readily see God's glory and creation.
[1383.00 → 1384.46] And, you know, my wife was just mentioning
[1384.46 → 1387.82] how the trees this year, the turning of the leaves,
[1387.86 → 1390.00] is so bright and beautiful.
[1390.44 → 1393.30] And so we see the beauty of God's glory,
[1393.30 → 1395.96] but we're also quickly faced with the reality
[1395.96 → 1399.58] that things are not the way that they should be.
[1401.18 → 1404.36] And often, instead of caring for God's creation,
[1404.48 → 1407.72] he put us here as stewards of his creation,
[1407.80 → 1408.94] as his image bearers.
[1409.08 → 1411.76] Often we have neglected that calling, right?
[1411.76 → 1414.56] We have not taken care of our world as we should have.
[1415.34 → 1418.60] But instead of hiding from our failures,
[1419.10 → 1421.52] in confession, we can bring them before the God
[1421.52 → 1424.80] who sees us and who knows us and who loves us.
[1424.80 → 1428.42] And we find in Scripture that we are loved by the God
[1428.42 → 1430.56] who not only created the world,
[1430.70 → 1433.22] but who sent his Son to redeem the world.
[1433.98 → 1438.10] And so let's come together in a prayer of confession,
[1438.74 → 1441.00] and I will lead us as we pray.
[1441.36 → 1442.00] Let's pray together.
[1443.40 → 1445.14] Lord of heaven and earth,
[1445.60 → 1449.84] Lord, you have made us as stewards of your good creation.
[1450.56 → 1454.30] Lord, you called us to cultivate and to keep the earth.
[1454.80 → 1459.64] But we confess that we all too often have ignored and denied this calling,
[1460.22 → 1464.68] and we assumed to do with your creation as we pleased.
[1465.86 → 1468.80] Lord, we confess the ways that we have abused the riches
[1468.80 → 1472.34] of all the good things that you have provided for us.
[1473.10 → 1475.84] Lord, in our greed, we have taken more from the world
[1475.84 → 1478.26] than we have returned to it.
[1478.26 → 1481.38] In doing so, harming our neighbours
[1481.38 → 1484.80] and our own hearts in the process.
[1485.90 → 1489.72] Forgive us, Lord, and make us better stewards of your creation.
[1489.94 → 1491.52] Lord, would you remind us of the ways
[1491.52 → 1493.10] that you have taught us
[1493.10 → 1495.86] of how to live in this world that belongs to you,
[1496.40 → 1498.60] that we might live in gratitude
[1498.60 → 1502.32] and reflect your glory in and over all things.
[1502.32 → 1505.58] We pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1505.88 → 1506.24] Amen.
[1508.28 → 1512.46] Now hear God's assurance of pardon through Christ.
[1512.56 → 1516.54] This comes from Revelation 1, verses 5 and 6.
[1517.30 → 1518.04] It says,
[1518.04 → 1532.04] Amen.
[1533.48 → 1535.28] So let's rise again,
[1535.84 → 1539.28] and we'll sing a song praising God for his goodness
[1539.28 → 1542.18] in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1542.26 → 1543.24] Let's stand and sing together.
[1543.24 → 1573.22] Let's sing together.
[1573.24 → 1579.64] I could never keep my hold
[1579.64 → 1583.94] through life's fearful path
[1583.94 → 1588.86] For my love is often core
[1588.86 → 1594.58] He must hold me fast
[1594.58 → 1600.68] He will hold me fast
[1600.68 → 1605.02] He will hold me fast
[1605.02 → 1609.42] For my Saviour loves me so
[1609.42 → 1615.68] He will hold me fast
[1615.68 → 1616.68] He will hold me fast
[1616.68 → 1620.68] He will hold me fast
[1620.68 → 1626.68] Those He saves are His dead
[1626.68 → 1632.96] Christ will hold me fast
[1632.96 → 1636.68] Precious in His holy Son
[1636.68 → 1641.68] He will hold me fast
[1641.68 → 1647.50] He will not let my soul be lost
[1647.50 → 1651.42] His promises shall last
[1651.42 → 1653.42] He will not let my soul be lost
[1653.42 → 1656.94] He will hold me fast
[1656.94 → 1659.54] He will hold me fast
[1659.54 → 1661.24] He will hold me fast
[1661.24 → 1663.94] He will hold me fast
[1663.94 → 1671.94] He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast
[1671.94 → 1675.94] For my Saviour loves me so
[1675.94 → 1681.94] He will hold me fast
[1681.94 → 1694.94] For my life He bled and died
[1694.94 → 1698.94] Christ will hold me fast
[1698.94 → 1703.94] Justice has been satisfied
[1703.94 → 1708.94] He will hold me fast
[1708.94 → 1714.94] Raised with Him to endless life
[1714.94 → 1718.94] He will hold me fast
[1718.94 → 1723.94] Till our faith is turned to shine
[1723.94 → 1729.94] He will hold me fast
[1729.94 → 1733.94] He will hold me fast
[1733.94 → 1737.94] He will hold me fast
[1737.94 → 1743.94] For my Saviour loves me so
[1743.94 → 1747.94] He will hold me fast
[1747.94 → 1752.94] He will hold me fast
[1752.94 → 1756.94] He will hold me fast
[1756.94 → 1761.94] For my Saviour loves me so
[1761.94 → 1766.94] He will hold me fast
[1766.94 → 1768.94] He will hold me fast
[1768.94 → 1770.94] He will hold me fast
[1770.94 → 1771.94] And me will sing it
[1771.94 → 1781.94] He will hold me fast
[1781.94 → 1783.94] He will hold me fast
[1783.94 → 1785.94] He will hold me fast
[1785.94 → 1789.94] So yeah, our children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classrooms
[1789.94 → 1795.94] If you don't know where those are, just follow the crowd, and you can find where to go
[1795.94 → 1810.94] Okay, from the time I did my cross-training class to now I forgot to load my sermon on my iPad
[1810.94 → 1813.94] Panic
[1813.94 → 1814.94] Panic
[1814.94 → 1819.94] Yes, actually give me a minute
[1819.94 → 1823.94] Maybe, you know, don't go too far
[1823.94 → 1824.94] But turn to those around you
[1824.94 → 1825.94] I'll be right back
[1825.94 → 1827.94] I'll be right back
[1827.94 → 1828.94] Thank you
[1828.94 → 1829.94] Thank you
[1829.94 → 1831.94] Thank you
[1831.94 → 1833.94] Thank you
[1833.94 → 1837.94] Thank you
[1838.94 → 1839.94] What
[1839.94 → 1840.94] And
[1840.94 → 1841.94] Thank you
[1841.94 → 1871.92] Thank you.
[1871.94 → 1901.92] Thank you.
[1901.94 → 1904.26] Thank you.
[1904.26 → 1934.24] Thank you.
[1934.26 → 1964.24] Thank you.
[1964.26 → 1966.26] Thank you.
[1994.26 → 1996.26] Thank you.
[1996.26 → 1998.26] Thank you.
[1998.26 → 2006.26] Thank you.
[2006.26 → 2010.26] Thank you.
[2010.26 → 2012.26] Thank you.
[2012.26 → 2014.26] Thank you.
[2014.26 → 2016.26] Thank you.
[2016.26 → 2018.26] Thank you.
[2018.26 → 2020.26] Thank you.
[2020.26 → 2022.26] Thank you.
[2022.26 → 2023.26] Thank you.
[2023.26 → 2029.26] Thank you.
[2029.26 → 2031.26] Thank you.
[2031.26 → 2036.26] Thank you.
[2036.26 → 2040.92] in our hearts and in our minds, giving us life and joy and peace
[2040.92 → 2047.36] as we listen with the ears of faith to what you would have to say to us this morning.
[2047.88 → 2052.84] To the praise of God's Christ-glorious name we pray. Amen.
[2054.76 → 2059.84] So earlier this week, I visited Tony and Cora Caff,
[2059.84 → 2068.54] and Tony invited me to come and check out his hobby that he has been involved in for many years.
[2069.10 → 2072.00] And he's worried I'm going to embarrass him a little bit.
[2072.90 → 2076.32] But so he's got this hobby, and what is his hobby?
[2076.92 → 2079.62] It is restoring old jukeboxes.
[2080.36 → 2088.86] And so photo one here is a photo I took of his, a couple of his jukeboxes,
[2088.86 → 2090.42] and he has a whole room full of them.
[2091.18 → 2095.32] And so he turned on the power, and they all kind of come to life,
[2095.34 → 2096.56] and the lights up.
[2097.52 → 2102.44] And so for you kids who don't know what a jukebox is,
[2102.86 → 2105.68] this is also before my time, actually.
[2106.38 → 2111.32] So you put a coin in, and you push a button, and it chooses a song.
[2111.82 → 2114.82] There's a whole menu of songs, and it's got all these records in there.
[2114.82 → 2118.88] So you push the button, and it pulls the record that you selected,
[2119.18 → 2120.50] and it will start playing it.
[2120.58 → 2121.50] So you can play a song.
[2121.56 → 2122.72] You put in a coin, you play a song.
[2123.02 → 2125.86] A little different from Spotify, but kind of the same idea.
[2127.62 → 2132.54] And it's amazing that Tony restored these himself.
[2133.62 → 2136.12] And so I'm going to show you a before picture.
[2136.12 → 2139.74] And so that's just one part.
[2140.02 → 2142.12] And this is, I took a photo of his photo album.
[2142.42 → 2143.46] There's one part of it.
[2144.10 → 2146.34] And to me, it looks like complete junk.
[2146.84 → 2148.28] Would you ever want to bring that home?
[2148.94 → 2149.72] I wouldn't.
[2150.00 → 2151.70] I'd bring it to the dump.
[2152.84 → 2154.64] But, you know, and I would say, I would look at that,
[2154.68 → 2157.76] and I would say, there is no hope that that can be restored.
[2158.62 → 2160.02] But then here's the next photo.
[2160.02 → 2160.66] Right?
[2163.02 → 2163.94] And it's the same part.
[2165.66 → 2170.18] And so what Tony did was bring, give it a new life, in a sense.
[2170.22 → 2170.84] And it's amazing.
[2171.50 → 2174.02] And he restores all the parts like that, right?
[2174.06 → 2176.98] From the inside motors and the electrical components and the speakers
[2176.98 → 2181.32] to the outside wood finishes and all of it, and he makes it new again.
[2182.48 → 2186.50] And so as I, you know, I was working on this sermon, preparing it,
[2186.50 → 2189.34] I was thinking back, and I thought it was such a wonderful picture
[2189.34 → 2192.80] of the way in which God deals with this whole world.
[2194.00 → 2198.46] You see, God makes this world, and behold, it is very good.
[2199.16 → 2200.78] But then it goes haywire.
[2201.62 → 2202.80] And what does God do?
[2203.58 → 2207.10] He doesn't scrap it and start over again.
[2207.30 → 2210.78] He could have done that, but that's not really God's way.
[2211.72 → 2214.94] Instead, God takes what is broken, what is cursed,
[2214.94 → 2217.52] what has been subjected to frustration,
[2218.12 → 2221.34] and he restores it to something new again.
[2222.36 → 2224.90] And that is what is before us in our passage this morning.
[2225.20 → 2228.36] And what it does, this passage, is it helps us to understand
[2228.36 → 2231.74] that the purposes of God are so much bigger
[2231.74 → 2234.70] than our individual salvation.
[2235.76 → 2235.94] Right?
[2236.00 → 2238.28] Because in this passage here, Paul has in view
[2238.28 → 2243.02] not just our personal redemptions as Christians,
[2243.02 → 2244.78] but that's also in this passage.
[2245.20 → 2247.02] But actually, it's much bigger.
[2247.20 → 2249.78] It includes the whole cosmos as well.
[2250.68 → 2254.42] And we see that very clearly here in Romans chapter 8.
[2254.62 → 2256.60] So that's what we're going to be thinking about today,
[2256.68 → 2260.50] how God takes what is broken and renews it.
[2260.74 → 2264.58] And specifically, he's talking about this created world that he made.
[2265.04 → 2266.50] So let's have a look at these verses,
[2267.08 → 2269.50] beginning in verse 19.
[2269.50 → 2272.92] So Paul writes this,
[2273.58 → 2278.04] For the creation waits in eager expectation
[2278.04 → 2281.26] for the children of God to be revealed.
[2281.64 → 2283.68] So we can see here, the children of God,
[2283.70 → 2285.46] we talked about that last week, that's us,
[2286.08 → 2287.46] and our salvation,
[2287.72 → 2292.26] but human beings in creation are intimately connected.
[2292.88 → 2294.48] And so let's see how that is.
[2294.48 → 2299.16] And so notice he begins, he's talking about creation.
[2299.96 → 2302.28] For the creation waits.
[2303.26 → 2306.92] And it's interesting that in saying the creation waits
[2306.92 → 2310.28] in eager expectation, he's personifying creation.
[2310.82 → 2318.08] He's ascribing to creation human-like emotions and affections.
[2318.50 → 2320.56] And this is actually something we see throughout the Bible.
[2320.56 → 2324.38] So you can read in Psalm 98, verse 8,
[2324.86 → 2325.80] where it says this,
[2326.14 → 2328.78] Let the rivers clap their hands.
[2329.04 → 2332.84] Let the mountains sing together for joy.
[2333.96 → 2335.90] Now, rivers don't have hands.
[2336.76 → 2337.96] But you can imagine, right,
[2338.02 → 2340.70] a river and maybe the rapids and the waves
[2340.70 → 2342.92] kind of clapping together and making that sound.
[2342.92 → 2345.30] Or if you go up to Whistler,
[2345.98 → 2348.42] you might hear the little animals,
[2348.52 → 2348.98] what are they called?
[2349.70 → 2350.14] Marmots?
[2350.50 → 2350.82] Whistling?
[2351.16 → 2352.62] So the mountains are singing.
[2353.96 → 2354.12] Right?
[2354.34 → 2359.94] But it's ascribing these positive emotions
[2359.94 → 2361.72] to the creation.
[2361.86 → 2364.20] It's having this ability to praise God,
[2364.38 → 2365.62] to sing with joy,
[2365.98 → 2367.02] to clap hands.
[2368.36 → 2369.40] You know, and then we can think about
[2369.40 → 2371.38] the very goodness of the creation that God made.
[2371.38 → 2373.46] God made all that we can see,
[2373.76 → 2375.80] even the things that we can't see.
[2376.34 → 2376.56] Right?
[2376.64 → 2379.12] From the very smallest molecules
[2379.12 → 2381.88] to the most distant galaxies.
[2382.64 → 2386.76] And this whole universe is breathed into existence by God.
[2387.58 → 2387.72] Right?
[2387.80 → 2388.54] And so, in a sense,
[2388.60 → 2389.88] you can think of God as the creator,
[2390.00 → 2390.46] the maker,
[2390.90 → 2392.52] and, if you will,
[2392.62 → 2395.28] his fingerprints over all of it.
[2396.40 → 2398.36] Because he is intimately involved
[2398.36 → 2401.24] in fashioning the whole of creation into existence.
[2402.38 → 2403.98] And then we're told in Genesis
[2403.98 → 2405.80] that when God looked at what he had made,
[2405.90 → 2406.32] he said,
[2406.74 → 2407.30] it is good,
[2407.66 → 2408.50] it is good,
[2408.66 → 2409.50] it is good.
[2409.96 → 2411.40] And then after the sixth day,
[2411.98 → 2413.88] when he had completed all that he had made,
[2414.38 → 2415.00] he said what?
[2415.62 → 2418.56] It is all very good.
[2419.50 → 2421.28] And the creation is still good.
[2421.42 → 2422.34] It's still good today.
[2423.00 → 2424.82] But in Paul's language here,
[2424.90 → 2425.98] in Romans chapter 8,
[2426.20 → 2427.26] creation is given
[2427.26 → 2429.16] a negative emotion.
[2429.94 → 2431.02] We see something negative
[2431.02 → 2432.92] in the sense that creation
[2432.92 → 2435.96] waits with eager longing.
[2437.12 → 2438.30] So there's something missing.
[2438.44 → 2440.14] There's something that it doesn't have
[2440.14 → 2441.58] that is longing for.
[2442.42 → 2443.46] And so what is the problem?
[2443.98 → 2445.62] Well, the problem is found in verse 20.
[2447.00 → 2447.48] It says,
[2447.48 → 2459.04] So notice that Paul says here,
[2459.36 → 2460.82] not by its own choice.
[2461.34 → 2462.26] That's fascinating.
[2463.02 → 2465.22] The creation was subjected to frustration,
[2465.48 → 2467.30] but not by its own choice.
[2467.30 → 2469.54] In other words,
[2469.64 → 2470.84] the frustration
[2470.84 → 2473.50] that creation presently experiences,
[2474.60 → 2475.52] the sense in which
[2475.52 → 2477.16] the world doesn't work
[2477.16 → 2477.90] the way it should.
[2479.28 → 2479.64] Right?
[2479.68 → 2481.18] It's not the way God made the world.
[2481.32 → 2482.90] It's not intrinsic to creation.
[2483.96 → 2484.16] Right?
[2484.20 → 2485.24] The world now
[2485.24 → 2486.34] is not the way
[2486.34 → 2488.06] God created it to be.
[2488.16 → 2489.32] It's not the way it should be.
[2490.92 → 2492.54] And notice that it wasn't because
[2492.54 → 2495.38] creation itself did anything wrong,
[2495.38 → 2497.42] but it is something that God did.
[2499.28 → 2500.38] God says, right,
[2500.74 → 2501.88] he creates the world.
[2502.14 → 2502.40] He says,
[2502.46 → 2503.36] Behold, it is good.
[2503.42 → 2503.96] It is good.
[2504.02 → 2504.62] It is good.
[2504.62 → 2505.98] Over and over again.
[2506.84 → 2507.70] But then sin
[2507.70 → 2509.36] enters into the world
[2509.36 → 2510.42] through Adam
[2510.42 → 2512.00] and all creation
[2512.00 → 2514.00] was put under a curse
[2514.00 → 2516.16] or subjected to frustration.
[2517.50 → 2518.50] And so let's look at
[2518.50 → 2519.54] Genesis chapter 3
[2519.54 → 2520.20] where we see this
[2520.20 → 2520.86] right in the beginning
[2520.86 → 2522.26] where God says to Adam,
[2522.70 → 2524.26] Cursed is the ground
[2524.26 → 2525.56] because of you.
[2526.70 → 2527.74] Through painful toil
[2527.74 → 2528.96] you will eat food from it
[2528.96 → 2530.08] all the days of your life.
[2530.16 → 2530.76] It will produce
[2530.76 → 2533.08] thorns and thistles for you.
[2533.44 → 2534.84] By the sweat of your brow
[2534.84 → 2536.50] will you eat your food
[2536.50 → 2539.12] until you return to the ground
[2539.12 → 2541.02] for from dust you came
[2541.02 → 2542.00] and to dust you will return.
[2543.62 → 2545.16] And we see throughout the scriptures
[2545.16 → 2546.68] that our sin
[2546.68 → 2548.52] not only separated us from God
[2548.52 → 2549.40] as Adam and Eve
[2549.40 → 2550.62] are then banished from the garden,
[2550.62 → 2552.92] but it has an impact
[2552.92 → 2554.60] on creation as well.
[2555.32 → 2556.86] Our sin has an impact
[2556.86 → 2558.36] on our relationship
[2558.36 → 2560.04] not just with God
[2560.04 → 2561.08] and ourselves and others
[2561.08 → 2562.74] but with the earth.
[2564.50 → 2565.84] And so in the book of Hosea
[2565.84 → 2567.00] it's so fascinating,
[2567.64 → 2568.62] tragically fascinating,
[2568.98 → 2570.26] but the people of Israel
[2570.26 → 2572.42] are told because of their idolatry,
[2573.04 → 2573.94] worshipping other gods,
[2574.12 → 2575.48] because of their injustice,
[2575.94 → 2576.86] mistreating others,
[2576.86 → 2578.70] it says,
[2579.22 → 2580.66] the beasts of the field,
[2580.96 → 2582.30] the birds of the heavens,
[2582.40 → 2584.02] and even the fish of the sea
[2584.02 → 2584.60] are dying.
[2587.24 → 2588.20] That's astounding
[2588.20 → 2590.24] that our sin
[2590.24 → 2591.86] is so intimately
[2591.86 → 2593.28] and intricately connected
[2593.28 → 2594.06] with the natural world
[2594.06 → 2594.82] that we cause
[2594.82 → 2597.00] the animals that God made
[2597.00 → 2598.14] to actually perish.
[2599.86 → 2601.36] No, we live in a fallen world
[2601.36 → 2602.10] in the sense
[2602.10 → 2604.10] that creation doesn't act always
[2604.10 → 2605.02] in the way
[2605.02 → 2606.20] we wish it would.
[2607.52 → 2608.26] So, you know,
[2608.32 → 2608.98] thinking about that,
[2609.06 → 2610.20] like when was the last time
[2610.20 → 2611.18] you prayed for rain?
[2612.44 → 2613.34] Now some of you farmers
[2613.34 → 2614.76] actually maybe did
[2614.76 → 2615.68] pray for rain
[2615.68 → 2616.84] somewhat recently.
[2617.28 → 2618.42] The rest of us,
[2618.54 → 2619.26] what do we pray for?
[2620.34 → 2620.78] Sun.
[2621.66 → 2622.54] We want sunny weather
[2622.54 → 2623.24] so we can go out
[2623.24 → 2623.90] and enjoy it.
[2624.22 → 2625.04] What do I pray for?
[2626.76 → 2627.16] Yes.
[2627.90 → 2628.34] Snow,
[2628.58 → 2629.42] because I like to go skiing.
[2630.20 → 2630.70] And, you know,
[2630.72 → 2631.48] what's interesting is
[2631.48 → 2632.68] we can pray for these things.
[2632.76 → 2633.72] We can pray for snow
[2633.72 → 2634.56] and rain.
[2634.80 → 2635.08] Why?
[2635.82 → 2636.94] Because God created them.
[2637.06 → 2637.72] God is sovereign
[2637.72 → 2638.76] over his creation.
[2639.40 → 2640.36] It's not like meaningless
[2640.36 → 2641.62] that we pray for these things.
[2643.44 → 2644.96] But rain isn't
[2644.96 → 2646.34] a big issue
[2646.34 → 2647.18] for most of us.
[2647.78 → 2648.98] But you go to other parts
[2648.98 → 2649.46] of the world
[2649.46 → 2651.32] and people are
[2651.32 → 2652.20] literally
[2652.20 → 2653.90] crying out
[2653.90 → 2655.16] for rain
[2655.16 → 2656.60] because their life
[2656.60 → 2657.50] depends on it
[2657.50 → 2658.52] and yet the rain
[2658.52 → 2659.66] doesn't always come.
[2659.66 → 2662.20] and earthquakes
[2662.20 → 2662.74] happen
[2662.74 → 2664.84] and mudslides
[2664.84 → 2665.36] happen
[2665.36 → 2666.74] and people's homes
[2666.74 → 2667.90] are obliterated.
[2668.90 → 2669.04] Right?
[2669.10 → 2669.72] And there are people
[2669.72 → 2671.28] in underdeveloped parts
[2671.28 → 2671.64] of the world
[2671.64 → 2672.46] who live in shacks
[2672.46 → 2673.30] and we say
[2673.30 → 2674.08] that is terrible
[2674.08 → 2675.08] that they live in shacks.
[2675.26 → 2676.02] But then a hurricane
[2676.02 → 2676.52] comes
[2676.52 → 2677.58] and it blows down
[2677.58 → 2678.32] all their shacks
[2678.32 → 2680.32] and they have to build them
[2680.32 → 2681.26] again if they're able to.
[2682.34 → 2683.12] So it's just
[2683.12 → 2684.84] suffering
[2684.84 → 2685.74] upon suffering
[2685.74 → 2686.78] and it's largely
[2686.78 → 2688.18] due to not only injustice
[2688.18 → 2690.14] but how creation
[2690.14 → 2690.98] is just
[2690.98 → 2692.02] out of whack.
[2694.12 → 2695.08] And this is the effect
[2695.08 → 2696.04] of a created world
[2696.04 → 2697.28] that is crying out
[2697.28 → 2698.42] for liberation
[2698.42 → 2699.58] from bondage.
[2700.44 → 2701.58] And there are floods
[2701.58 → 2703.24] and there are droughts.
[2704.58 → 2705.60] There's disease
[2705.60 → 2706.38] in the land
[2706.38 → 2708.50] and you need fertilizers
[2708.50 → 2709.10] and pesticides
[2709.10 → 2709.86] because sometimes
[2709.86 → 2710.76] crops and plants
[2710.76 → 2711.62] and fruit don't grow.
[2712.72 → 2712.82] Right?
[2712.90 → 2713.22] And then now
[2713.22 → 2713.76] in people
[2713.76 → 2714.76] in our own sin
[2714.76 → 2716.36] we pile on
[2716.36 → 2717.36] into the frustration
[2717.36 → 2718.54] of creation
[2718.54 → 2719.68] by cutting down
[2719.68 → 2720.48] entire forests
[2720.48 → 2721.40] allowing the soil
[2721.40 → 2722.22] to erode
[2722.22 → 2723.04] uselessly away
[2723.04 → 2725.00] by polluting our water
[2725.00 → 2726.24] in the air
[2726.24 → 2728.00] endangering our own health
[2728.00 → 2729.00] and on and on.
[2730.48 → 2731.88] And so because of human sin
[2731.88 → 2733.16] and because of the curse
[2733.16 → 2735.18] creation doesn't work
[2735.18 → 2736.26] in the way that
[2736.26 → 2737.26] God originally
[2737.26 → 2738.30] made it to work
[2738.30 → 2739.18] in all of its goodness.
[2739.82 → 2740.70] There is frustration
[2740.70 → 2741.64] there is pain
[2741.64 → 2742.68] there is toil
[2742.68 → 2743.74] there is sadness
[2743.74 → 2745.28] to the creation.
[2745.28 → 2747.12] sin has deeply
[2747.12 → 2748.70] affected our relationship
[2748.70 → 2749.78] with the created world.
[2750.28 → 2750.90] That's what the Bible
[2750.90 → 2751.26] teaches.
[2752.36 → 2754.24] But now that being said
[2754.24 → 2755.44] we can't ignore
[2755.44 → 2756.32] another aspect
[2756.32 → 2757.16] which is this
[2757.16 → 2757.74] of our life
[2757.74 → 2758.22] in the world
[2758.22 → 2759.98] we need to keep in mind
[2759.98 → 2761.44] not only the frustration
[2761.44 → 2762.26] of creation
[2762.26 → 2763.56] that is in bondage
[2763.56 → 2764.84] to decay and destruction
[2764.84 → 2766.12] but think about
[2766.12 → 2767.00] on the other hand
[2767.00 → 2767.78] how God
[2767.78 → 2769.70] has kept alive
[2769.70 → 2770.70] people
[2770.70 → 2771.84] by his grace
[2771.84 → 2772.46] and his goodness.
[2772.46 → 2774.08] right?
[2774.16 → 2774.92] Because if you stop
[2774.92 → 2775.72] to consider it
[2775.72 → 2776.92] does God
[2776.92 → 2777.92] owe us rain?
[2779.72 → 2780.64] Does God
[2780.64 → 2782.48] owe us rain
[2782.48 → 2783.48] to provide food
[2783.48 → 2784.04] for crops?
[2784.62 → 2785.80] Does he owe us
[2785.80 → 2786.46] sunshine
[2786.46 → 2787.84] to keep us warm?
[2788.54 → 2789.34] Does he owe us
[2789.34 → 2789.70] anything?
[2790.66 → 2791.48] And the answer
[2791.48 → 2791.84] is no.
[2793.00 → 2793.94] Because we have
[2793.94 → 2794.84] forfeited
[2794.84 → 2795.78] our rights
[2795.78 → 2797.00] to any good thing
[2797.00 → 2797.60] from God
[2797.60 → 2798.42] because of our sin.
[2798.42 → 2800.66] but
[2800.66 → 2802.42] you read
[2802.42 → 2803.36] in the book of Acts
[2803.36 → 2804.04] right?
[2804.12 → 2804.38] And so
[2804.38 → 2805.14] in Acts
[2805.14 → 2806.04] Paul is preaching
[2806.04 → 2806.90] in Asia Minor
[2806.90 → 2807.98] he's preaching
[2807.98 → 2808.40] to people
[2808.40 → 2809.14] who don't know
[2809.14 → 2809.90] the living God
[2809.90 → 2811.30] who walk
[2811.30 → 2812.16] in their own ways
[2812.16 → 2812.66] it says
[2812.66 → 2814.02] and what does Paul
[2814.02 → 2814.68] say to them?
[2815.18 → 2815.54] He says
[2815.54 → 2816.50] God did not
[2816.50 → 2817.32] leave himself
[2817.32 → 2818.36] without testimony
[2818.36 → 2819.76] to all these people
[2819.76 → 2820.24] in the world
[2820.24 → 2821.06] who don't know God.
[2821.32 → 2822.04] He didn't leave himself
[2822.04 → 2822.84] without testimony.
[2823.70 → 2824.40] God has actually
[2824.40 → 2825.70] shown his good
[2825.70 → 2826.40] and gracious
[2826.40 → 2827.26] nature
[2827.26 → 2829.38] to all peoples
[2829.38 → 2830.06] in creation.
[2830.72 → 2831.72] So this is what he says
[2831.72 → 2832.64] in Acts 14.
[2833.36 → 2834.00] Yet he has not
[2834.00 → 2834.70] left himself
[2834.70 → 2835.52] without testimony
[2835.52 → 2836.84] he has shown
[2836.84 → 2837.84] kindness
[2837.84 → 2839.66] by giving you
[2839.66 → 2840.76] rain from heaven
[2840.76 → 2841.70] and crops
[2841.70 → 2842.60] in their seasons
[2842.60 → 2843.92] he provides you
[2843.92 → 2845.12] with plenty of food
[2845.12 → 2846.52] and fills your hearts
[2846.52 → 2847.44] with joy.
[2849.12 → 2850.60] That is quite amazing.
[2852.66 → 2854.68] So how many of us
[2854.68 → 2855.82] have ever
[2855.82 → 2857.44] eaten food
[2857.44 → 2860.10] or had a drink?
[2860.90 → 2862.00] How many of us
[2862.00 → 2863.58] have experienced
[2863.58 → 2864.58] joy in this life
[2864.58 → 2865.12] or laughed
[2865.12 → 2865.86] for even a moment?
[2867.00 → 2868.10] What is that
[2868.10 → 2869.32] but a testimony
[2869.32 → 2870.74] of God's grace
[2870.74 → 2871.54] and his goodness
[2871.54 → 2872.50] to you?
[2874.38 → 2875.48] And so creation
[2875.48 → 2876.48] is still good
[2876.48 → 2878.42] God still cares
[2878.42 → 2879.32] for his creation
[2879.32 → 2880.28] and the creation
[2880.28 → 2881.20] has value
[2881.20 → 2882.98] because God
[2882.98 → 2883.98] created it
[2883.98 → 2885.38] and he values it.
[2887.38 → 2889.46] But not only that
[2889.46 → 2890.22] but it gets
[2890.22 → 2890.88] even better
[2890.88 → 2892.60] because there is
[2892.60 → 2893.22] also hope
[2893.22 → 2893.94] for creation.
[2894.36 → 2895.10] And we see this
[2895.10 → 2895.64] in our passage
[2895.64 → 2897.24] in verses 20
[2897.24 → 2898.26] and then into 21.
[2899.26 → 2899.94] So again
[2899.94 → 2900.68] it says
[2900.68 → 2901.42] for the creation
[2901.42 → 2902.14] was subjected
[2902.14 → 2902.88] to frustration
[2902.88 → 2903.92] not by its own choice
[2903.92 → 2904.84] but by the will
[2904.84 → 2905.36] of the one
[2905.36 → 2906.28] who subjected it
[2906.28 → 2907.86] in hope
[2907.86 → 2908.78] that the creation
[2908.78 → 2910.62] itself will be liberated
[2910.62 → 2912.04] from its bondage
[2912.04 → 2912.66] to decay
[2912.66 → 2913.86] and brought
[2913.86 → 2914.48] into
[2914.48 → 2915.62] the freedom
[2915.62 → 2916.90] and glory
[2916.90 → 2918.24] of the children
[2918.24 → 2918.76] of God.
[2919.74 → 2920.44] And so just as
[2920.44 → 2921.16] God
[2921.16 → 2922.30] is going to redeem
[2922.30 → 2922.90] us
[2922.90 → 2924.90] in the same way
[2924.90 → 2925.64] and kind of
[2925.64 → 2926.32] simultaneously
[2926.32 → 2927.94] he will redeem
[2927.94 → 2928.84] this world
[2928.84 → 2929.44] that he made.
[2930.94 → 2931.16] Right?
[2931.22 → 2932.08] And so the very God
[2932.08 → 2932.90] who subjects
[2932.90 → 2933.74] the creation
[2933.74 → 2935.44] also liberates
[2935.44 → 2936.88] the same creation.
[2938.00 → 2938.46] And God
[2938.46 → 2939.20] will make
[2939.20 → 2939.96] this world
[2939.96 → 2940.48] again
[2940.48 → 2941.74] to be the way
[2941.74 → 2942.32] he always
[2942.32 → 2942.96] intended it
[2942.96 → 2943.42] to be.
[2944.34 → 2945.26] And the good news
[2945.26 → 2945.52] friends
[2945.52 → 2946.22] is that God
[2946.22 → 2946.76] has already
[2946.76 → 2947.62] started that work.
[2948.28 → 2949.00] It's not something
[2949.00 → 2949.72] that is only
[2949.72 → 2950.30] in the future
[2950.30 → 2950.90] but God
[2950.90 → 2952.08] has begun
[2952.08 → 2953.06] that work
[2953.06 → 2953.80] of restoring
[2953.80 → 2954.58] the world
[2954.58 → 2955.84] in the coming
[2955.84 → 2956.92] of Jesus Christ.
[2957.48 → 2959.20] So 2,000 years ago
[2959.20 → 2961.64] the second Adam
[2961.64 → 2963.16] entered into the world
[2963.16 → 2963.88] that was subjected
[2963.88 → 2964.58] to frustration.
[2965.16 → 2966.22] And that word Adam
[2966.22 → 2967.02] I don't know
[2967.02 → 2967.34] if you know
[2967.34 → 2967.84] in the Bible
[2967.84 → 2968.52] it means
[2968.52 → 2969.82] son of the soil
[2969.82 → 2970.64] essentially
[2970.64 → 2972.08] from the ground.
[2973.44 → 2974.40] And now the second
[2974.40 → 2976.08] son of the earth
[2976.08 → 2977.64] in his incarnation
[2977.64 → 2979.20] took on flesh
[2979.20 → 2980.20] became a son
[2980.20 → 2980.76] of the earth
[2980.76 → 2981.72] and walked
[2981.72 → 2982.74] in this frustrated
[2982.74 → 2983.66] world of creation.
[2984.02 → 2984.94] That's what Jesus did.
[2985.22 → 2985.86] And Jesus came
[2985.86 → 2986.78] and he showed himself
[2986.78 → 2987.66] as Lord
[2987.66 → 2989.10] of the creation.
[2989.10 → 2991.92] He calmed
[2991.92 → 2993.34] the raging seas.
[2994.40 → 2995.24] He multiplied
[2995.24 → 2996.90] bread and fish
[2996.90 → 2998.06] to feed the people
[2998.06 → 2999.24] showing the graciousness
[2999.24 → 2999.66] of God.
[3000.08 → 3001.34] He healed diseases.
[3001.86 → 3002.40] He gave sight
[3002.40 → 3002.98] to the blind.
[3004.16 → 3005.10] But he was also
[3005.10 → 3006.38] subjected to the pain
[3006.38 → 3007.40] and the suffering
[3007.40 → 3009.06] of this world.
[3009.72 → 3009.84] Right?
[3009.90 → 3011.36] And so the thorns
[3011.36 → 3013.56] that came
[3013.56 → 3014.36] as a result
[3014.36 → 3015.42] of the curse
[3015.42 → 3016.02] in Genesis
[3016.02 → 3017.10] were then placed
[3017.10 → 3017.90] upon his head.
[3019.14 → 3020.26] And the trees
[3020.26 → 3021.92] that clapped
[3021.92 → 3022.50] their hands
[3022.50 → 3023.34] in praise of God
[3023.34 → 3023.70] were made
[3023.70 → 3024.48] into a cross.
[3025.98 → 3026.92] And when Jesus
[3026.92 → 3028.14] died on that cross
[3028.14 → 3029.52] what happened?
[3030.28 → 3030.84] Creation
[3030.84 → 3032.02] itself
[3032.02 → 3032.98] reacted
[3032.98 → 3034.96] to Jesus
[3034.96 → 3035.58] on the cross.
[3036.46 → 3036.88] How did
[3036.88 → 3038.00] creation react?
[3038.06 → 3038.46] Do you remember?
[3039.46 → 3040.40] There was an eclipse.
[3041.06 → 3041.54] The skies
[3041.54 → 3042.46] became dark.
[3043.42 → 3043.86] There was
[3043.86 → 3044.48] an earthquake.
[3045.50 → 3046.06] The graves
[3046.06 → 3046.62] were opened
[3046.62 → 3048.54] and so creation
[3048.54 → 3049.18] reacted
[3049.18 → 3050.30] to the death
[3050.30 → 3050.90] of the one
[3050.90 → 3052.02] by and for whom
[3052.02 → 3052.90] all things were made.
[3054.04 → 3054.56] And then when Jesus
[3054.56 → 3055.28] rose again
[3055.28 → 3056.16] there was another
[3056.16 → 3056.72] earthquake
[3056.72 → 3058.10] as the stone
[3058.10 → 3059.08] was rolled away.
[3060.10 → 3060.84] And why
[3060.84 → 3061.92] is the creation
[3061.92 → 3062.56] reacting
[3062.56 → 3063.56] to this act
[3063.56 → 3064.06] of redemption?
[3064.40 → 3064.90] It's because
[3064.90 → 3065.78] these are cosmic
[3065.78 → 3066.32] events.
[3067.14 → 3067.24] Right?
[3067.34 → 3068.22] They were literally
[3068.22 → 3069.04] earth-shattering
[3069.04 → 3069.64] events
[3069.64 → 3071.62] where the beginning
[3071.62 → 3072.26] of the renewal
[3072.26 → 3072.92] and the restoration
[3072.92 → 3073.66] of the whole
[3073.66 → 3074.28] of creation
[3074.28 → 3075.02] has begun.
[3075.02 → 3077.34] And so God
[3077.34 → 3077.96] doesn't
[3077.96 → 3078.78] create this
[3078.78 → 3079.38] world good
[3079.38 → 3080.54] and after
[3080.54 → 3080.88] it falls
[3080.88 → 3081.46] into a sin
[3081.46 → 3082.24] just abandon
[3082.24 → 3082.64] it
[3082.64 → 3084.20] abandon this
[3084.20 → 3084.60] world that he
[3084.60 → 3084.88] made.
[3085.12 → 3085.40] No, he
[3085.40 → 3086.14] comes into
[3086.14 → 3086.78] the world
[3086.78 → 3087.92] he suffers
[3087.92 → 3089.18] in this world
[3089.18 → 3089.80] he dies
[3089.80 → 3090.46] in this world
[3090.46 → 3091.32] and he conquers
[3091.32 → 3092.08] this world
[3092.08 → 3092.42] of sin
[3092.42 → 3092.90] and death
[3092.90 → 3094.18] so that the
[3094.18 → 3094.60] world could
[3094.60 → 3095.02] one day
[3095.02 → 3095.66] be renewed
[3095.66 → 3096.90] and redeemed.
[3098.48 → 3098.80] And so
[3098.80 → 3099.06] you know
[3099.06 → 3099.60] the prophet
[3099.60 → 3100.38] Isaiah
[3100.38 → 3102.24] he foretold
[3102.24 → 3103.02] a day
[3103.02 → 3103.86] to come
[3103.86 → 3104.96] in the future
[3104.96 → 3106.14] where
[3106.14 → 3107.24] he says
[3107.24 → 3107.64] in Isaiah
[3107.64 → 3108.12] 55
[3108.12 → 3109.36] this is a
[3109.36 → 3109.70] prophecy
[3109.70 → 3110.32] of the future
[3110.32 → 3111.38] the people
[3111.38 → 3111.96] of God
[3111.96 → 3112.48] he says
[3112.48 → 3113.24] you all
[3113.24 → 3113.76] will go
[3113.76 → 3114.18] out
[3114.18 → 3114.88] in joy
[3114.88 → 3115.44] you will
[3115.44 → 3115.78] be led
[3115.78 → 3116.26] forth
[3116.26 → 3117.18] in peace
[3117.18 → 3117.98] as they
[3117.98 → 3118.44] are ushered
[3118.44 → 3118.78] into the
[3118.78 → 3119.04] kingdom
[3119.04 → 3119.56] of God
[3119.56 → 3120.94] the mountains
[3120.94 → 3121.58] and hills
[3121.58 → 3122.74] will burst
[3122.74 → 3123.70] into song
[3123.70 → 3124.54] before you
[3124.54 → 3125.92] all the
[3125.92 → 3126.38] trees
[3126.38 → 3126.74] of the
[3126.74 → 3127.14] field
[3127.14 → 3127.92] will clap
[3127.92 → 3128.54] their hands
[3128.54 → 3130.40] instead
[3130.40 → 3130.76] of the
[3130.76 → 3131.62] thorn bush
[3131.62 → 3132.48] will grow
[3132.48 → 3133.02] the juniper
[3133.02 → 3133.80] instead
[3133.80 → 3134.70] of briars
[3134.70 → 3135.72] the myrtle
[3135.72 → 3136.24] will grow
[3136.24 → 3137.34] this will be
[3137.34 → 3137.70] for the
[3137.70 → 3138.40] Lord's renown
[3138.40 → 3138.72] for an
[3138.72 → 3139.10] everlasting
[3139.10 → 3139.60] sing
[3139.60 → 3139.92] that will
[3139.92 → 3140.20] endure
[3140.20 → 3140.60] forever
[3140.60 → 3142.52] God
[3142.52 → 3142.74] is
[3142.74 → 3144.54] taking
[3144.54 → 3145.44] what he
[3145.44 → 3145.94] has made
[3145.94 → 3146.30] that has
[3146.30 → 3146.68] fallen
[3146.68 → 3147.36] into sin
[3147.36 → 3147.98] and he
[3147.98 → 3148.78] is restoring
[3148.78 → 3149.26] it
[3149.26 → 3151.52] until at
[3151.52 → 3151.74] last
[3151.74 → 3151.98] it will
[3151.98 → 3152.34] be made
[3152.34 → 3152.50] new
[3152.50 → 3152.84] again
[3152.84 → 3155.86] and so
[3155.86 → 3156.22] as we
[3156.22 → 3156.68] think about
[3156.68 → 3157.18] this world
[3157.18 → 3157.78] that God
[3157.78 → 3158.92] is redeeming
[3158.92 → 3159.62] and restoring
[3159.62 → 3160.60] there's this
[3160.60 → 3161.08] wonderful
[3161.08 → 3161.96] Greek word
[3161.96 → 3162.98] chains
[3162.98 → 3164.32] chains
[3164.32 → 3165.18] it's a word
[3165.18 → 3165.42] in the
[3165.42 → 3165.96] New Testament
[3165.96 → 3167.36] that is
[3167.36 → 3168.56] always used
[3168.56 → 3169.24] when it
[3169.24 → 3169.80] talks about
[3169.80 → 3170.70] new creation
[3170.70 → 3172.00] and when it
[3172.00 → 3172.42] talks about
[3172.42 → 3172.90] our new
[3172.90 → 3173.34] life
[3173.34 → 3173.98] in Christ
[3173.98 → 3174.24] it's
[3174.24 → 3174.80] chains
[3174.80 → 3175.96] and in
[3175.96 → 3176.48] this word
[3176.48 → 3176.98] it doesn't
[3176.98 → 3177.28] mean
[3177.28 → 3178.50] brand new
[3178.50 → 3180.50] never seen
[3180.50 → 3181.44] before new
[3181.44 → 3182.50] it means
[3182.50 → 3183.58] renewed
[3183.58 → 3184.52] new
[3184.52 → 3185.24] as in
[3185.24 → 3185.80] renewed
[3185.80 → 3186.54] repaired
[3186.54 → 3187.76] restored
[3187.76 → 3188.14] restored
[3188.14 → 3189.98] or even
[3189.98 → 3191.34] recycled
[3191.34 → 3193.16] okay
[3193.16 → 3194.42] there is
[3194.42 → 3194.80] a very
[3194.80 → 3195.20] good
[3195.20 → 3195.68] theological
[3195.68 → 3196.24] reason
[3196.24 → 3197.06] to
[3197.06 → 3197.52] recycle
[3197.52 → 3199.02] why
[3199.02 → 3200.20] because
[3200.20 → 3200.42] God
[3200.42 → 3200.96] recycles
[3200.96 → 3202.08] okay
[3202.08 → 3202.64] God
[3202.64 → 3203.20] doesn't
[3203.20 → 3203.48] throw
[3203.48 → 3203.88] stuff
[3203.88 → 3204.34] away
[3204.34 → 3204.98] he
[3204.98 → 3205.26] makes
[3205.26 → 3205.38] it
[3205.38 → 3205.52] new
[3205.52 → 3205.84] again
[3205.84 → 3206.96] so
[3206.96 → 3207.14] that's
[3207.14 → 3207.42] kind of
[3207.42 → 3207.78] interesting
[3207.78 → 3208.34] I like
[3208.34 → 3208.58] that
[3208.58 → 3209.06] so
[3209.06 → 3209.16] that's
[3209.16 → 3209.26] why
[3209.26 → 3209.34] I
[3209.34 → 3209.42] tell
[3209.42 → 3209.58] my
[3209.58 → 3209.74] kids
[3209.74 → 3210.02] now
[3210.02 → 3211.38] recycle
[3211.38 → 3211.94] why
[3211.94 → 3212.98] God
[3212.98 → 3213.68] recycles
[3213.68 → 3214.70] there's
[3214.70 → 3214.84] nothing
[3214.84 → 3215.08] you know
[3215.08 → 3215.38] you can't
[3215.38 → 3215.52] have a
[3215.52 → 3215.76] better
[3215.76 → 3216.62] argument
[3216.62 → 3217.02] than that
[3217.02 → 3218.34] now
[3218.34 → 3219.00] the new
[3219.00 → 3219.60] creation
[3219.60 → 3220.34] so what
[3220.34 → 3220.66] that means
[3220.66 → 3221.04] is the
[3221.04 → 3221.24] new
[3221.24 → 3221.62] creation
[3221.62 → 3221.92] that we
[3221.92 → 3222.34] look forward
[3222.34 → 3222.58] to
[3222.58 → 3222.90] that we're
[3222.90 → 3223.20] longing
[3223.20 → 3223.62] for
[3223.62 → 3224.56] is
[3224.56 → 3225.38] the old
[3225.38 → 3225.90] creation
[3225.90 → 3226.60] this creation
[3226.60 → 3227.04] that God
[3227.04 → 3227.56] made very
[3227.56 → 3227.94] good
[3227.94 → 3228.56] but has
[3228.56 → 3229.26] been damaged
[3229.26 → 3230.06] is now
[3230.06 → 3230.54] being
[3230.54 → 3231.60] made new
[3231.60 → 3231.98] again
[3231.98 → 3232.62] chains
[3232.62 → 3232.88] new
[3232.88 → 3234.12] and so
[3234.12 → 3234.56] when Jesus
[3234.56 → 3234.86] in the
[3234.86 → 3235.20] revelation
[3235.20 → 3236.06] chapter 21
[3236.06 → 3236.98] says this
[3236.98 → 3237.80] behold
[3237.80 → 3238.86] I am
[3238.86 → 3239.18] making
[3239.18 → 3240.00] everything
[3240.00 → 3240.88] new
[3240.88 → 3242.48] it's that
[3242.48 → 3242.64] word
[3242.64 → 3243.24] chains
[3243.24 → 3243.62] new
[3243.62 → 3244.24] in its
[3244.24 → 3244.82] character
[3244.82 → 3245.88] transformed
[3245.88 → 3247.04] in a
[3247.04 → 3247.48] fundamental
[3247.48 → 3247.94] way
[3247.94 → 3248.72] just like
[3248.72 → 3249.54] we become
[3249.54 → 3250.22] new
[3250.22 → 3250.86] creations
[3250.86 → 3251.42] in Christ
[3251.42 → 3251.76] when we
[3251.76 → 3252.06] are born
[3252.06 → 3252.36] again
[3252.36 → 3255.14] and this
[3255.14 → 3255.98] big cosmic
[3255.98 → 3256.54] picture of
[3256.54 → 3257.16] what God
[3257.16 → 3258.18] intends to
[3258.18 → 3258.56] do with
[3258.56 → 3258.90] all of
[3258.90 → 3259.04] his
[3259.04 → 3259.54] creation
[3259.54 → 3260.56] helps us
[3260.56 → 3261.26] understand
[3261.26 → 3262.78] that the
[3262.78 → 3263.44] purposes of
[3263.44 → 3263.96] God are
[3263.96 → 3264.34] much
[3264.34 → 3264.96] bigger
[3264.96 → 3265.76] than
[3265.76 → 3266.56] our
[3266.56 → 3267.36] personal
[3267.36 → 3267.98] individual
[3267.98 → 3268.46] salvation
[3268.46 → 3269.42] and that
[3269.42 → 3269.82] brings us
[3269.82 → 3270.04] to a
[3270.04 → 3270.20] couple
[3270.20 → 3270.52] points
[3270.52 → 3270.64] of
[3270.64 → 3271.04] application
[3271.04 → 3271.48] as we
[3271.48 → 3271.76] kind of
[3271.76 → 3272.02] come to
[3272.02 → 3272.48] a close
[3272.48 → 3274.08] and the
[3274.08 → 3274.76] first one
[3274.76 → 3275.24] so two
[3275.24 → 3275.56] things I
[3275.56 → 3275.74] want to
[3275.74 → 3275.90] say
[3275.90 → 3276.32] the first
[3276.32 → 3276.88] is this
[3276.88 → 3278.18] is to
[3278.18 → 3278.84] challenge
[3278.84 → 3280.30] you
[3280.30 → 3280.74] just a
[3280.74 → 3281.22] little bit
[3281.22 → 3281.66] with this
[3281.66 → 3282.10] question
[3282.10 → 3284.14] how big
[3284.14 → 3285.20] is your
[3285.20 → 3285.54] Jesus
[3285.54 → 3288.54] how big
[3288.54 → 3288.90] is your
[3288.90 → 3289.40] how when
[3289.40 → 3289.68] you think
[3289.68 → 3290.38] about Jesus
[3290.38 → 3290.90] what he's
[3290.90 → 3291.20] come to
[3291.20 → 3291.44] do
[3291.44 → 3292.52] how big
[3292.52 → 3292.92] is your
[3292.92 → 3293.42] picture of
[3293.42 → 3293.62] Jesus
[3293.62 → 3294.04] Christ
[3294.04 → 3295.24] and so
[3295.24 → 3295.62] do you
[3295.62 → 3296.00] have a
[3296.00 → 3296.28] Jesus
[3296.28 → 3297.30] if you
[3297.30 → 3297.62] like
[3297.62 → 3297.96] who is
[3297.96 → 3298.32] kind of
[3298.32 → 3298.66] pocket
[3298.66 → 3299.16] sized
[3299.16 → 3300.00] a
[3300.00 → 3300.40] personal
[3300.40 → 3300.82] saviour
[3300.82 → 3301.70] who
[3301.70 → 3302.50] is there
[3302.50 → 3302.98] only
[3302.98 → 3303.52] to
[3303.52 → 3304.02] save
[3304.02 → 3305.00] you
[3305.00 → 3306.64] that's
[3306.64 → 3306.90] the wrong
[3306.90 → 3307.20] answer
[3307.20 → 3308.16] or
[3308.16 → 3309.12] do you
[3309.12 → 3309.44] have a
[3309.44 → 3309.66] Jesus
[3309.66 → 3309.98] who is
[3309.98 → 3310.12] the
[3310.12 → 3310.36] saviour
[3310.36 → 3310.66] of the
[3310.66 → 3310.96] world
[3310.96 → 3312.16] who is
[3312.16 → 3312.54] the one
[3312.54 → 3313.26] who created
[3313.26 → 3313.94] everything
[3313.94 → 3314.92] and through
[3314.92 → 3315.18] whose
[3315.18 → 3315.82] resurrection
[3315.82 → 3316.84] we find
[3316.84 → 3317.14] that
[3317.14 → 3317.80] everything
[3317.80 → 3318.20] is being
[3318.20 → 3318.42] made
[3318.42 → 3318.72] new
[3318.72 → 3319.72] including
[3319.72 → 3320.46] not only
[3320.46 → 3320.74] your
[3320.74 → 3321.20] salvation
[3321.20 → 3322.38] but also
[3322.38 → 3323.24] this whole
[3323.24 → 3323.62] world that
[3323.62 → 3323.86] he has
[3323.86 → 3324.18] made
[3324.18 → 3325.68] and so
[3325.68 → 3326.10] you know
[3326.10 → 3326.74] we look
[3326.74 → 3326.96] at the
[3326.96 → 3327.28] bible
[3327.28 → 3327.76] and
[3327.76 → 3328.36] god
[3328.36 → 3328.64] is so
[3328.64 → 3328.78] much
[3328.78 → 3329.32] bigger
[3329.32 → 3330.26] than we
[3330.26 → 3331.28] sometimes
[3331.28 → 3332.36] imagine
[3332.36 → 3334.02] so what
[3334.02 → 3334.22] I would
[3334.22 → 3334.64] say for
[3334.64 → 3335.18] us today
[3335.18 → 3335.74] is let's
[3335.74 → 3336.34] ask god
[3336.34 → 3336.68] to help
[3336.68 → 3337.38] us see
[3337.38 → 3338.46] and hope
[3338.46 → 3339.30] for all
[3339.30 → 3339.78] that he
[3339.78 → 3340.28] is doing
[3340.28 → 3340.84] to redeem
[3340.84 → 3341.20] this whole
[3341.20 → 3341.64] creation
[3341.64 → 3342.74] because this
[3342.74 → 3343.06] is our
[3343.06 → 3343.30] home
[3343.30 → 3344.12] this is
[3344.12 → 3344.54] where we
[3344.54 → 3345.02] will dwell
[3345.02 → 3345.44] one day
[3345.44 → 3345.90] with god
[3345.90 → 3347.44] so that's
[3347.44 → 3347.76] the first
[3347.76 → 3348.04] thing
[3348.04 → 3349.42] the second
[3349.42 → 3350.02] point
[3350.02 → 3351.02] is that
[3351.02 → 3351.66] this big
[3351.66 → 3352.14] picture
[3352.14 → 3352.78] that the
[3352.78 → 3352.96] bible
[3352.96 → 3353.64] gives us
[3353.64 → 3354.68] it actually
[3354.68 → 3355.24] doesn't make
[3355.24 → 3356.30] our individual
[3356.30 → 3356.98] roles
[3356.98 → 3358.18] any less
[3358.18 → 3358.62] important
[3358.62 → 3359.38] it actually
[3359.38 → 3359.82] makes them
[3359.82 → 3360.40] more important
[3360.40 → 3362.44] because god
[3362.44 → 3363.44] calls us
[3363.44 → 3364.14] to work
[3364.14 → 3365.12] with him
[3365.12 → 3365.80] as his
[3365.80 → 3366.86] co-creators
[3366.86 → 3368.02] his partners
[3368.02 → 3368.88] in caring
[3368.88 → 3369.48] for creation
[3369.48 → 3370.16] we see that
[3370.16 → 3370.82] right in the
[3370.82 → 3371.48] very beginning
[3371.48 → 3372.40] where god
[3372.40 → 3373.18] put Adam
[3373.18 → 3373.42] and eve
[3373.42 → 3373.66] in the
[3373.66 → 3373.96] garden
[3373.96 → 3374.76] told them
[3374.76 → 3375.44] to tend
[3375.44 → 3375.68] it
[3375.68 → 3376.58] to cultivate
[3376.58 → 3376.92] it
[3376.92 → 3377.66] to keep
[3377.66 → 3377.96] it
[3377.96 → 3378.68] that is the
[3378.68 → 3379.00] cultural
[3379.00 → 3379.44] mandate
[3379.44 → 3380.22] and that
[3380.22 → 3380.58] has never
[3380.58 → 3381.14] gone away
[3381.14 → 3383.46] and so
[3383.46 → 3383.90] it is a
[3383.90 → 3384.90] very Christian
[3384.90 → 3385.44] thing
[3385.44 → 3386.22] to care
[3386.22 → 3386.82] about nature
[3386.82 → 3388.36] it is a
[3388.36 → 3389.20] very Christian
[3389.20 → 3389.58] thing
[3389.58 → 3390.14] to care
[3390.14 → 3390.50] about the
[3390.50 → 3390.94] environment
[3390.94 → 3392.32] to care
[3392.32 → 3392.76] about the
[3392.76 → 3393.28] ways
[3393.28 → 3394.04] as human
[3394.04 → 3394.50] beings
[3394.50 → 3395.16] that we
[3395.16 → 3395.88] live in
[3395.88 → 3396.34] this world
[3396.34 → 3396.96] and steward
[3396.96 → 3397.84] this world
[3397.84 → 3398.76] because we
[3398.76 → 3399.28] are intimately
[3399.28 → 3399.70] connected
[3399.70 → 3400.10] with it
[3400.10 → 3401.20] we are
[3401.20 → 3401.62] part of
[3401.62 → 3401.86] god's
[3401.86 → 3402.26] creation
[3402.26 → 3403.92] now
[3403.92 → 3405.02] there are
[3405.02 → 3405.74] sometimes
[3405.74 → 3406.38] kind of
[3406.38 → 3406.84] strange
[3406.84 → 3407.26] and weird
[3407.26 → 3407.76] ways
[3407.76 → 3408.80] that can
[3408.80 → 3409.36] go
[3409.36 → 3410.40] right
[3410.40 → 3410.84] sometimes
[3410.84 → 3411.26] in our
[3411.26 → 3411.54] culture
[3411.54 → 3412.04] creation
[3412.04 → 3412.86] is worshipped
[3412.86 → 3413.22] as an
[3413.22 → 3413.44] idol
[3413.44 → 3414.58] and we
[3414.58 → 3414.86] especially
[3414.86 → 3415.26] see that
[3415.26 → 3415.56] here
[3415.56 → 3416.04] in
[3416.04 → 3417.06] supernatural
[3417.06 → 3417.42] British
[3417.42 → 3417.80] Columbia
[3417.80 → 3419.74] but that
[3419.74 → 3420.10] doesn't mean
[3420.10 → 3420.44] we should
[3420.44 → 3421.60] just ignore
[3421.60 → 3422.58] god's
[3422.58 → 3422.92] calling
[3422.92 → 3423.52] to us
[3423.52 → 3424.62] because we
[3424.62 → 3425.02] are to
[3425.02 → 3425.74] honour this
[3425.74 → 3426.02] world
[3426.02 → 3426.60] not worship
[3426.60 → 3426.92] it but
[3426.92 → 3427.62] honour it
[3427.62 → 3428.40] and to
[3428.40 → 3429.04] care for
[3429.04 → 3429.32] it
[3429.32 → 3430.06] because god
[3430.06 → 3430.48] cares for
[3430.48 → 3430.76] it
[3430.76 → 3432.52] so when
[3432.52 → 3433.22] god
[3433.22 → 3433.64] you know
[3433.64 → 3434.88] brought his
[3434.88 → 3435.48] people into
[3435.48 → 3435.96] the promised
[3435.96 → 3436.38] land
[3436.38 → 3438.06] he gave
[3438.06 → 3438.44] them the
[3438.44 → 3438.86] law
[3438.86 → 3439.38] and part
[3439.38 → 3439.68] of that
[3439.68 → 3440.08] law
[3440.08 → 3440.48] that god
[3440.48 → 3440.84] gave them
[3440.84 → 3441.22] was all
[3441.22 → 3441.46] of these
[3441.46 → 3441.98] instructions
[3441.98 → 3442.60] for how
[3442.60 → 3443.04] for what
[3443.04 → 3443.88] how to
[3443.88 → 3444.16] farm
[3444.16 → 3445.46] how to
[3445.46 → 3445.88] care for
[3445.88 → 3446.36] the land
[3446.36 → 3447.08] how to
[3447.08 → 3447.84] you know
[3447.84 → 3448.64] how to let
[3448.64 → 3448.98] the land
[3448.98 → 3449.44] rest
[3449.44 → 3450.22] and sabbaths
[3450.22 → 3450.80] and festivals
[3450.80 → 3451.74] and jubilees
[3451.74 → 3453.08] and then
[3453.08 → 3454.04] based on
[3454.04 → 3454.72] the bible's
[3454.72 → 3455.14] teaching
[3455.14 → 3456.32] there is a
[3456.32 → 3457.12] whole history
[3457.12 → 3458.04] and heritage
[3458.04 → 3459.44] of reformed
[3459.44 → 3460.00] thinking
[3460.00 → 3460.68] and spirituality
[3460.68 → 3461.80] when it
[3461.80 → 3462.22] comes to
[3462.22 → 3462.58] caring for
[3462.58 → 3463.06] creation
[3463.06 → 3463.84] I don't know
[3463.84 → 3464.12] if you knew
[3464.12 → 3464.40] that
[3464.40 → 3465.14] it's amazing
[3465.14 → 3466.26] and so
[3466.26 → 3467.00] John Calvin
[3467.00 → 3467.82] right
[3467.82 → 3468.60] our kind
[3468.60 → 3469.00] of hero
[3469.00 → 3469.36] of the
[3469.36 → 3469.72] faith
[3469.72 → 3471.10] he insisted
[3471.10 → 3471.90] that we
[3471.90 → 3472.94] not despoil
[3472.94 → 3473.68] the land
[3473.68 → 3474.56] because if
[3474.56 → 3475.08] we do so
[3475.08 → 3475.62] we are doing
[3475.62 → 3476.04] away with
[3476.04 → 3476.34] god's
[3476.34 → 3476.70] goodness
[3476.70 → 3478.78] John Calvin
[3478.78 → 3479.68] cautioned
[3479.68 → 3480.02] people
[3480.02 → 3480.72] not to
[3480.72 → 3481.08] damage
[3481.08 → 3481.56] trees
[3481.56 → 3484.70] John Calvin
[3484.70 → 3485.96] said
[3485.96 → 3486.80] that when
[3486.80 → 3487.54] god placed
[3487.54 → 3488.16] the animals
[3488.16 → 3488.98] in subjection
[3488.98 → 3489.48] to us
[3489.48 → 3490.34] he did it
[3490.34 → 3490.64] with the
[3490.64 → 3491.14] condition
[3491.14 → 3491.78] that we
[3491.78 → 3491.96] should
[3491.96 → 3492.34] handle
[3492.34 → 3492.74] them
[3492.74 → 3493.40] gently
[3493.40 → 3496.60] Calvin
[3496.60 → 3497.16] and the
[3497.16 → 3497.96] reformers
[3497.96 → 3499.22] saw caring
[3499.22 → 3500.14] for the
[3500.14 → 3500.70] trees
[3500.70 → 3501.16] and the
[3501.16 → 3501.60] animals
[3501.60 → 3502.42] as holy
[3502.42 → 3502.86] work
[3502.86 → 3504.20] and when
[3504.20 → 3505.04] the puritans
[3505.04 → 3505.48] the English
[3505.48 → 3505.88] puritans
[3505.88 → 3506.34] came to
[3506.34 → 3506.96] New England
[3506.96 → 3508.04] they set
[3508.04 → 3508.72] up laws
[3508.72 → 3509.06] and one
[3509.06 → 3509.28] of the
[3509.28 → 3509.64] first
[3509.64 → 3510.50] laws
[3510.50 → 3511.08] to
[3511.08 → 3511.60] for
[3511.60 → 3512.08] animal
[3512.08 → 3512.62] rights
[3512.62 → 3512.88] in a
[3512.88 → 3513.08] sense
[3513.08 → 3513.24] not
[3513.24 → 3513.46] right
[3513.46 → 3513.66] I don't
[3513.66 → 3513.86] like that
[3513.86 → 3513.98] word
[3513.98 → 3514.24] rights
[3514.24 → 3514.42] but
[3514.42 → 3515.44] care of
[3515.44 → 3515.90] animals
[3515.90 → 3516.28] not to
[3516.28 → 3516.48] be
[3516.48 → 3517.06] mistreated
[3517.06 → 3518.12] came from
[3518.12 → 3518.76] puritan
[3518.76 → 3519.26] New England
[3519.26 → 3520.12] which was
[3520.12 → 3520.70] the modern
[3520.70 → 3521.02] you know
[3521.02 → 3521.56] the predecessor
[3521.56 → 3522.36] for modern
[3522.36 → 3523.18] you know
[3523.18 → 3523.66] animal
[3523.66 → 3524.64] care
[3524.64 → 3525.22] kind of
[3525.22 → 3525.58] laws
[3525.58 → 3526.78] Christians
[3526.78 → 3526.80] Christians
[3526.80 → 3526.82] Christians
[3526.82 → 3527.08] were at
[3527.08 → 3527.28] the
[3527.28 → 3527.68] forefront
[3527.68 → 3529.12] of
[3529.12 → 3529.52] that
[3529.52 → 3529.90] work
[3529.90 → 3531.54] and we
[3531.54 → 3531.70] should
[3531.70 → 3532.04] continue
[3532.04 → 3532.22] to
[3532.22 → 3532.36] do
[3532.36 → 3532.58] so
[3532.58 → 3534.12] right
[3534.12 → 3534.56] because
[3534.56 → 3535.34] you know
[3535.34 → 3536.04] although we
[3536.04 → 3536.56] labour
[3536.56 → 3537.14] under the
[3537.14 → 3537.48] curse
[3537.48 → 3538.02] there is
[3538.02 → 3538.32] hope
[3538.32 → 3539.66] there is
[3539.66 → 3540.18] faith
[3540.18 → 3541.14] there is
[3541.14 → 3541.60] love
[3541.60 → 3543.48] for god
[3543.48 → 3543.86] and for
[3543.86 → 3544.38] all he's
[3544.38 → 3544.70] made
[3544.70 → 3545.84] because the
[3545.84 → 3546.16] god who
[3546.16 → 3546.94] is frustrated
[3546.94 → 3547.96] subjected
[3547.96 → 3548.70] this world
[3548.70 → 3549.32] to frustration
[3549.32 → 3550.82] will redeem
[3550.82 → 3551.20] it one
[3551.20 → 3551.44] day
[3551.44 → 3552.34] and it
[3552.34 → 3552.74] will be a
[3552.74 → 3553.10] place where
[3553.10 → 3553.42] righteousness
[3553.42 → 3554.26] dwells
[3554.26 → 3555.48] okay so
[3555.48 → 3555.80] let's pray
[3555.80 → 3556.20] together
[3556.20 → 3560.72] lord our
[3560.72 → 3561.16] god we
[3561.16 → 3561.56] thank you
[3561.56 → 3561.90] for this
[3561.90 → 3562.22] world
[3562.22 → 3563.70] and you
[3563.70 → 3564.02] could have
[3564.02 → 3564.52] wiped it
[3564.52 → 3565.00] all out
[3565.00 → 3566.10] at the
[3566.10 → 3566.58] very first
[3566.58 → 3567.02] hint of
[3567.02 → 3567.50] rebellion
[3567.50 → 3568.30] against you
[3568.30 → 3568.74] and you
[3568.74 → 3568.94] could have
[3568.94 → 3569.60] started over
[3569.60 → 3570.86] and yet
[3570.86 → 3571.64] lord you
[3571.64 → 3572.22] didn't and
[3572.22 → 3572.60] has not
[3572.60 → 3573.16] stopped you
[3573.16 → 3573.62] from being
[3573.62 → 3574.38] gracious and
[3574.38 → 3575.12] kind and
[3575.12 → 3576.22] redeeming us
[3576.22 → 3576.66] in this
[3576.66 → 3577.62] world through
[3577.62 → 3577.98] our lord
[3577.98 → 3578.68] Jesus Christ
[3578.68 → 3579.40] so we
[3579.40 → 3579.82] pray oh
[3579.82 → 3580.28] lord that
[3580.28 → 3580.90] as we
[3580.90 → 3582.54] wait along
[3582.54 → 3583.48] with creation
[3583.48 → 3584.10] in eager
[3584.10 → 3584.82] longing for
[3584.82 → 3585.52] our redemption
[3585.52 → 3586.54] that you
[3586.54 → 3586.94] would help
[3586.94 → 3587.84] us to
[3587.84 → 3588.78] care for
[3588.78 → 3589.42] and steward
[3589.42 → 3590.00] your world
[3590.00 → 3590.70] to the
[3590.70 → 3591.44] praise of
[3591.44 → 3592.10] your glory
[3592.10 → 3593.42] we pray in
[3593.42 → 3594.06] Jesus name
[3594.06 → 3594.78] amen
[3594.78 → 3597.00] now I'm
[3597.00 → 3597.92] going to surprise
[3597.92 → 3598.60] you perhaps
[3598.60 → 3599.28] a little bit
[3599.28 → 3600.16] because Paul
[3600.16 → 3600.78] is going to lead
[3600.78 → 3601.60] us in singing
[3601.60 → 3602.80] joy to the
[3602.80 → 3603.10] world
[3603.10 → 3604.56] it's not
[3604.56 → 3605.06] Christmas yet
[3605.06 → 3605.56] I know but
[3605.56 → 3606.06] you know what
[3606.06 → 3607.20] it's not a
[3607.20 → 3607.98] Christmas song
[3607.98 → 3609.94] and it
[3609.94 → 3610.98] talks about
[3610.98 → 3613.36] I forget
[3613.36 → 3613.78] the words
[3613.78 → 3614.20] but you'll
[3614.20 → 3614.54] see it
[3614.54 → 3615.40] like as
[3615.40 → 3616.34] far as
[3616.34 → 3616.90] the curse
[3616.90 → 3617.54] is found
[3617.54 → 3618.52] god's making
[3618.52 → 3619.02] his blessings
[3619.02 → 3619.42] known it
[3619.42 → 3619.82] talks about
[3619.82 → 3620.42] the renewal
[3620.42 → 3621.58] of the
[3621.58 → 3622.32] joy to
[3622.32 → 3622.60] the whole
[3622.60 → 3623.08] world because
[3623.08 → 3623.52] god is
[3623.52 → 3624.10] renewing all
[3624.10 → 3624.74] things so
[3624.74 → 3625.30] let's stand
[3625.30 → 3626.00] and let's
[3626.00 → 3626.32] sing joy
[3626.32 → 3626.52] to the
[3626.52 → 3626.76] world
[3626.76 → 3637.24] joy to
[3637.24 → 3637.78] the
[3637.78 → 3638.66] world
[3638.66 → 3640.78] is
[3640.78 → 3641.38] going
[3641.38 → 3651.38] live
[3651.38 → 3651.42] NBA I'm
[3651.42 → 3652.42] if
[3652.42 → 3653.76] is
[3653.76 → 3666.76] I'm a man that needs you to see, I'm a man that needs you to see, I'm a man that needs you to see.
[3666.76 → 3696.74] Changes the same way, and there is a man that needs you to see, I'm a man that needs you to see, I'm a man that needs you to see.
[3696.76 → 3716.92] Changes the same way, and there is a man that needs you to see.
[3716.92 → 3726.92] we
[3732.58 → 3734.92] he
[3746.92 → 3776.90] Thank you.
[3776.92 → 3782.10] Amen. You may be seated.
[3789.56 → 3797.80] So we continue to worship the Lord by the giving of our offerings, responding to his goodness and giving our offerings to him.
[3797.80 → 3802.14] And so our designated offering today is for a world to renew world hunger.
[3802.70 → 3806.26] It's kind of fitting from our sermon today.
[3806.92 → 3809.12] And there is actually a video we're going to watch.
[3809.26 → 3812.30] So first, may I invite our deacons to come forward to collect the offering?
[3812.54 → 3816.06] And then there's going to be a world renew little video clip for us to see.
[3816.06 → 3822.52] What if fish could mean an end to hunger?
[3823.30 → 3824.16] This is Maya.
[3824.52 → 3830.14] Her family lives in a region in Honduras where draft has made it difficult to grow food.
[3830.14 → 3834.94] But today, her garden abounds with a little help from fish.
[3835.68 → 3839.62] Through World Renew, Maya and her family learn about aquaponics.
[3840.36 → 3844.52] Where they once struggled to get enough to eat, they are now food secure.
[3844.52 → 3852.04] For Maya, an aquaponics system allows her to grow fresh fruits and vegetables with minimal water and soil.
[3852.92 → 3863.18] The fish waste, which works as a natural fertilizer, combined with the constant flow of water, helps plants to grow much faster than they would in a field.
[3863.18 → 3869.14] When Maya's community first hear about aquaponics, they didn't believe it would work.
[3869.80 → 3871.02] But Maya had hope.
[3871.60 → 3879.48] Thanks to aquaponics, she now has enough fresh fruits and vegetables to feed herself, her four children, and her grandchildren.
[3880.52 → 3887.04] Today, Maya has become a community leader, training her neighbours to farm with aquaponics.
[3887.68 → 3891.14] Fish changed Maya's story from hunger to hope.
[3891.14 → 3896.48] When families have the tools they need to overcome hunger, lives change.
[3897.28 → 3899.22] Children grow healthy and strong.
[3899.74 → 3902.34] Families rejoice in God's love and abundance.
[3902.98 → 3905.92] And communities walk together towards ending hunger.
[3906.94 → 3910.28] Today, when you support War Renew's World Hunger Work,
[3910.28 → 3915.00] you are partnered with families like Maya's to change the story of hunger.
[3921.14 → 3934.08] And actually, so John Mantra in our congregation is the World Renew Rep?
[3935.70 → 3936.54] Classes delegate.
[3936.54 → 3944.36] So for each class has a delegate that's part of World Renew or, you know, championing the cause of World Renew.
[3944.36 → 3947.16] So if you have any questions about it, please talk to John.
[3948.02 → 3948.30] Okay.
[3949.24 → 3957.38] And let's go ahead and go to the Lord in prayer and praying for the world and for our church.
[3957.80 → 3958.56] Let's pray together.
[3960.70 → 3964.22] Almighty and gracious Lord God,
[3964.22 → 3969.88] Lord,
[3969.88 → 3970.84] Lord,
[3970.84 → 3975.72] to lay our cares and our joys at the foot of the cross.
[3976.62 → 3978.98] The foot of the cross of Jesus our Lord.
[3980.02 → 3982.70] For you, Lord, are our heavenly Father,
[3982.88 → 3985.62] who is ever mindful of the needs of his children.
[3985.62 → 3990.22] those whom you call by name to be your treasured possession
[3990.22 → 3994.28] those you care for and watch over as the apple of your eye
[3994.28 → 3999.40] and more than the lilies of the field that neither toil nor spin
[3999.40 → 4003.80] are we arrayed in beauty by your hand oh lord
[4003.80 → 4008.30] father we thank you for the evidence that we see all around us
[4008.30 → 4012.68] in your creation lord of your perfection and your beauty
[4012.68 → 4015.24] and of your care in all things
[4015.24 → 4021.14] and we rejoice lord that day by day speech pours forth from your creation
[4021.14 → 4025.78] which proclaims and bears witness to your goodness and your gracious character
[4025.78 → 4031.44] and to your glory so father we thank you that you also
[4031.44 → 4035.56] we thank you also lord that you that the same care
[4035.56 → 4041.48] and the same loving hand is at work in the lives of your children
[4041.48 → 4048.38] and we see that care most clearly lord in the salvation that you have provided in Jesus Christ
[4048.38 → 4055.92] how is it lord that after creating the heavens and the earth that Jesus should leave such perfection of heaven
[4055.92 → 4060.12] and in glory to walk through the dusty heat of this earth
[4060.12 → 4066.02] to bring living water to those whose thirst could not be quenched by anything else
[4066.02 → 4070.66] thank you lord for the living water of our lord Jesus
[4070.66 → 4073.66] the salvation that wells up within us
[4073.66 → 4084.20] and may lord that those waters pour out and spill out as we also share that salvation
[4084.20 → 4088.40] with others like the woman at the well lord after meeting Jesus she left her jar
[4088.40 → 4093.36] and ran to tell others of the good news of the living water that she found in the messiah
[4093.36 → 4097.60] help each of us to bear that good news to those around us
[4097.60 → 4101.50] and lord we pray that together as a church
[4101.50 → 4105.70] would we bring the good news of living water to others
[4105.70 → 4110.58] lord help us to bear witness through our ESL ministry
[4110.58 → 4113.66] and gems and cadets and friendship club
[4113.66 → 4116.58] and um in all the other ways lord we
[4116.58 → 4119.50] we seek to be a blessing to those around us
[4119.50 → 4124.54] and through the missionaries and things like world renew lord would you bring your blessing
[4124.54 → 4126.44] upon a world in need
[4126.44 → 4132.24] lord and most of all we ask that you would quench
[4132.24 → 4136.18] the thirst of those who need the living water of salvation
[4136.18 → 4138.96] that they might experience forgiveness and grace
[4138.96 → 4141.82] the same that we have received from you
[4141.82 → 4144.54] and father you know um
[4144.54 → 4147.88] before a word is even uttered the thoughts of our hearts
[4147.88 → 4153.96] and so-and-so often lord our thoughts and prayers are with those whom we love
[4153.96 → 4156.34] our thoughts and prayers are with those
[4156.34 → 4159.38] um in our family and also in our church family
[4159.38 → 4162.68] and so lord we think of those in our congregation
[4162.68 → 4166.78] who are approaching those years of age that are so difficult
[4166.78 → 4171.30] when uh it seems like our bodies begin to fall apart
[4171.30 → 4176.38] yet we know lord your promise is not to forsake them
[4176.38 → 4178.46] that you will never do so
[4178.46 → 4182.02] that even in that stage of life that they are in as believers
[4182.02 → 4186.96] they have at your will the ability and the power
[4186.96 → 4189.92] to proclaim to another generation of your goodness
[4189.92 → 4193.56] and we ask lord for your great favour upon those who are struggling
[4193.56 → 4196.80] with age but also lord for all of those
[4196.80 → 4201.58] who have infirmities and have great care in this life and physical ailments
[4201.58 → 4205.76] please lord give them the warmth of your gentle presence
[4205.76 → 4208.80] heal them of their physical needs
[4208.80 → 4212.24] and tend to their souls as only you can
[4212.24 → 4215.38] we think especially today of Mel and Shirley
[4215.38 → 4217.74] and lord we pray for their healing
[4217.74 → 4222.60] we pray lord for Sean as he's in Arizona seeking treatment for Lyme disease

[4226.26 → 4228.74] and pray also for her healing
[4228.74 → 4232.98] as we also pray for jenny who spends much time and energy caring for her
[4232.98 → 4235.38] and for anyone else lord
[4235.38 → 4240.30] who we do not know who's right now
[4240.30 → 4241.88] but lord whose walk is troubled
[4241.88 → 4245.28] for whatever reason lord we pray that you would help them
[4245.28 → 4247.84] to trust and lean solely on you
[4247.84 → 4249.48] our lord god
[4249.48 → 4254.10] and we offer these prayers lord in the name of our creating and our caring god
[4254.10 → 4255.58] father son and Holy Spirit
[4255.58 → 4257.66] who with all creation we worship
