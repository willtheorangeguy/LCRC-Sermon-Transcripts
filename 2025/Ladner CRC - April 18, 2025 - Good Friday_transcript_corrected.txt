[365.98 → 373.46] morning, let's take a moment to prepare our hearts. Let's ask God in silent prayer for
[373.46 → 377.84] his presence and for his blessing on this time of worship.
[377.84 → 402.86] Holy and loving God, as we prepare to set aside this time to focus intently on Jesus' suffering
[402.86 → 410.24] and death, we ask for eyes to see all the amazing things that Jesus' death means for our
[410.24 → 417.26] understanding of you, of your immeasurable love, and of the salvation which you have purchased for us.
[417.88 → 424.88] We thank you, Lord, that you did not send your Son into the world to condemn it, but to save the world
[424.88 → 433.20] through him. In Christ's name, we pray. Amen. Let's stand as we sing our first song this morning.
[454.88 → 462.16] Thank you.

[606.22 → 608.38] My life.
[614.26 → 619.58] Please remain standing and hear now the Lord's call to worship from Isaiah 53.
[620.12 → 622.48] Who has believed our message?
[623.22 → 626.00] And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[627.34 → 631.56] Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering.
[632.70 → 638.02] Yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him and afflicted.
[638.72 → 641.28] But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[642.04 → 644.90] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[645.30 → 649.42] The punishment that brought us peace was on him.
[650.12 → 653.18] And by his wounds, we are healed.

[782.88 → 783.88] Amen.
[787.88 → 791.88] The Anointing at Bethany by Mary.
[791.88 → 798.88] Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had
[798.88 → 800.88] raised from the dead.
[800.88 → 804.88] Here, a dinner was given in Jesus' honour.
[804.88 → 810.88] Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
[810.88 → 816.88] Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume.
[816.88 → 821.88] She poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair.
[821.88 → 825.88] And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
[825.88 → 833.88] But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected.
[833.88 → 838.88] Why wasn't this perfume sold, and the money given to the poor?
[838.88 → 841.88] It was worth a year's wages.
[841.88 → 848.88] He did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief.
[848.88 → 854.88] As keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
[854.88 → 855.88] Leave her alone.
[855.88 → 860.88] It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
[860.88 → 865.88] You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
[865.88 → 874.88] As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it.
[874.88 → 876.88] He seemed so tired.
[876.88 → 886.88] As Jesus practiced so as evil, he got them into worth it.
[886.88 → 889.88] He dwelt so much, and he had no two years round.
[889.88 → 896.50] In the body andırım-felled
[896.66 → 904.52] A play a throne in our Lowell Stephen.
[919.88 → 928.32] Christ, Lord, turn to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[929.18 → 936.34] Christ, Lord, turn to the Lord God, our Saviour.
[942.34 → 948.26] If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace,
[948.26 → 951.56] but now it is hidden from your eyes.
[952.46 → 957.06] The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you
[957.06 → 960.46] and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
[961.12 → 966.10] They will dash you to the ground, you and your children within your walls.
[967.30 → 969.74] They will not leave one stone on another
[969.74 → 975.06] because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.
[978.26 → 996.46] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[996.46 → 1001.66] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1001.66 → 1005.74] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1006.54 → 1015.46] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1015.46 → 1025.60] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1025.60 → 1028.68] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1028.68 → 1033.80] Jesus, Lord, turn to the Lord.
[1033.80 → 1040.92] Jesus, remember me
[1040.92 → 1044.76] When you come into your kingdom
[1044.76 → 1050.80] Jesus, remember me
[1050.80 → 1055.18] When you come into your kingdom
[1055.18 → 1061.96] Jesus at the temple
[1061.96 → 1064.64] When Jesus entered Jerusalem
[1064.64 → 1067.92] The whole city was thrown into an uproar
[1067.92 → 1068.68] And asked
[1068.68 → 1072.02] Who is this?
[1072.90 → 1077.88] This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee
[1077.88 → 1080.86] Jesus entered the temple courts
[1080.86 → 1083.80] And drove out all who were buying and selling there
[1083.80 → 1086.78] He overturned the tables of the money changers
[1086.78 → 1089.04] And the benches of those selling doves
[1089.04 → 1094.44] It is written, my house will be called the house of prayer
[1094.44 → 1098.54] But you are making it a den of progress
[1098.54 → 1102.72] The blind and the lame came to him at the temple
[1102.72 → 1104.42] And he healed them
[1104.42 → 1107.74] But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law
[1107.74 → 1110.14] Saw the wonderful things he did
[1110.14 → 1112.88] And the children shouting in the temple courts
[1112.88 → 1115.06] Hosanna to the son of David
[1115.06 → 1116.92] They were indignant
[1116.92 → 1122.08] Do you hear what these children are saying?
[1123.18 → 1124.90] Yes, have you never read
[1124.90 → 1127.70] From the lips of children and infants
[1127.70 → 1132.30] You, Lord, have called forth your praise
[1132.30 → 1150.32] Amen.
[1150.32 → 1151.76] Amen.
[1151.76 → 1154.22] If you see us, we don't understand
[1154.22 → 1156.06] We are with His children
[1156.06 → 1158.06] Amen.
[1186.06 → 1188.06] Amen.
[1216.06 → 1222.26] Jesus' authority challenged.
[1223.34 → 1230.96] Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him.
[1232.40 → 1238.92] By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?
[1241.46 → 1244.30] I will also ask you one question.
[1244.30 → 1249.98] If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
[1250.84 → 1257.10] John's baptism, where did it come from? Was it from heaven or of human origin?
[1258.46 → 1260.90] They discussed it among themselves.
[1262.58 → 1268.64] If we say, from heaven, he will ask, then why didn't you believe him?
[1268.64 → 1279.56] But if we say of human origin, we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.
[1280.74 → 1282.80] So they answered Jesus,
[1283.80 → 1285.72] We don't know.
[1285.72 → 1292.62] Neither then will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
[1292.62 → 1294.62] Jesus' name is Jesus.
[1294.62 → 1296.62] Amen.
[1296.62 → 1298.62] Amen.
[1298.62 → 1300.62] Amen.
[1300.62 → 1302.62] Amen.
[1302.62 → 1304.62] Amen.
[1304.62 → 1306.62] Amen.
[1306.62 → 1308.62] Amen.
[1308.62 → 1310.62] Amen.
[1310.62 → 1312.62] Amen.
[1312.62 → 1332.62] Amen.
[1332.62 → 1334.62] Amen.
[1334.96 → 1336.28] Amen.
[1336.28 → 1344.28] The Lord is a sinner, the most afflicted.
[1345.58 → 1355.28] Who was the guilty, who had this upon you?
[1355.28 → 1365.28] It is a treason, for God has unknown you.
[1365.28 → 1382.28] Who was our Lord Jesus, my God's divine, my crucify of you.
[1382.28 → 1402.28] O Lord, dear Jesus, love's your incarnation, your mortal sorrow and your life's salvation.
[1402.28 → 1407.28] Lord, dear Jesus, your love's salvation.
[1407.28 → 1418.28] Your salvation and your bitter passion, all my salvation.
[1418.28 → 1430.28] O Lord, dear Jesus, his love will pay you.
[1430.28 → 1441.28] I do adore you, and will ever bring you.
[1441.28 → 1451.28] Think of your beauty, and your love will serve me.
[1451.28 → 1461.28] God, my desire will be.
[1461.28 → 1468.28] The plot to kill Jesus.
[1468.28 → 1474.28] Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.
[1474.28 → 1478.28] What are we accomplishing?
[1478.28 → 1481.28] Here is this man performing many signs.
[1481.28 → 1487.28] If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him.
[1487.28 → 1496.28] Then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.
[1496.28 → 1503.28] Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up.
[1503.28 → 1506.28] You know nothing at all.
[1506.28 → 1515.28] You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.
[1515.28 → 1532.28] He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, and not only for that nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and to make them one.
[1532.28 → 1536.28] So from that day, they plotted to take his life.
[1536.28 → 1537.28] Wow.
[1537.28 → 1538.28] Wow.
[1538.28 → 1539.28] Coolies.
[1539.28 → 1540.28] Wow.
[1540.28 → 1541.28] Wow.

[1556.28 → 1557.28] Wow.
[1557.28 → 1558.28] Wow.
[1558.28 → 1559.28] Wow.
[1559.28 → 1568.94] Hold my grace, love is His, O my soul, oh my soul,
[1569.42 → 1576.24] Hold my grace, love is His, O my soul.
[1578.82 → 1584.24] Hold my grace, love is His, O my soul,
[1584.24 → 1588.24] Let us know the rest of the world.
[1588.24 → 1595.24] To heaven, dread the cruises for my soul.
[1595.24 → 1605.24] To heaven, dread the cruises for my soul.
[1605.24 → 1626.24] When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down.
[1626.24 → 1636.24] When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down, sinking down.
[1636.24 → 1643.24] My state of sadness, love for my soul.
[1643.24 → 1646.24] For my soul.
[1646.24 → 1655.24] My state of sadness, love for my soul.
[1655.24 → 1661.24] The Passover.
[1661.24 → 1665.24] On the first day of the festival of unleavened bread,
[1665.24 → 1669.24] when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb,
[1669.24 → 1673.24] Jesus' disciples asked him,
[1673.24 → 1681.24] Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?
[1681.24 → 1685.24] So he sent two of his disciples.
[1685.24 → 1691.24] Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.
[1691.24 → 1693.24] Follow him.
[1693.24 → 1695.24] Say to the owner of the house he enters,
[1695.24 → 1697.24] The teacher asks,
[1697.24 → 1699.24] Where is my guest room?
[1699.24 → 1705.24] Where may I eat the Passover with my disciples?
[1705.24 → 1709.24] He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready.
[1709.24 → 1713.24] Make preparations for us there.
[1713.24 → 1721.24] The disciples left, went into the city, and found things just as Jesus had told them.
[1721.24 → 1725.24] So they prepared the Passover.
[1725.24 → 1727.24] Father Hebert loads in love.
[1727.24 → 1729.24] Are you благодарing their elders,
[1729.24 → 1731.24] We appreciated that the 수가 of these saints to help us with Him.
[1731.24 → 1732.24] You will always the Passover,
[1732.24 → 1733.24] You will always the Passover.
[1733.24 → 1735.24] But God only we approving you a humble day.
[1735.24 → 1739.24] And His food is wisdom.
[1739.24 → 1743.24] Panther Moypsutan rocks with heroes and potatoes.
[1743.24 → 1746.24] Amen.
[1773.24 → 1775.24] Amen.
[1803.24 → 1805.24] Amen.
[1833.24 → 1835.24] Amen.
[1863.24 → 1865.24] Amen.
[1893.24 → 1903.44] Amen.
[1904.24 → 1913.62] So hear these words that Jesus said, and this is the Last Supper that Jesus celebrated with his disciples.
[1913.62 → 1919.00] When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
[1920.32 → 1926.18] And he said to them, I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
[1927.02 → 1933.64] For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.
[1934.88 → 1941.46] After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.
[1943.62 → 1951.30] For I tell you, I will not drink it again.
[1951.84 → 1956.82] I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
[1958.40 → 1961.96] And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it.
[1961.96 → 1974.40] He gave it to them, saying, This is my body given for you.
[1975.24 → 1976.86] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1977.70 → 1983.64] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
[1983.64 → 1983.94] Thank you.
[1988.16 → 1991.34] So may I ask our elders who are serving to come forward?
[1991.34 → 1992.18] Thank you.
