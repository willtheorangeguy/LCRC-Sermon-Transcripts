• The speaker announces that they will be taking a break from preaching on Romans chapter 8 to focus on Psalm 20.
• Psalm 20 is read aloud, asking God for protection, support, and victory in battle.
• The speaker explains the context of the psalm, describing it as a congregational prayer for King David before he went into battle.
• The speaker sets the scene for King David's army, describing their armor, banners, and preparations for war.
• The purpose of Psalm 20 is explained: to ask God for victory in battle.
• The psalm is a song of benediction and prayer that declares God as the protector, help, and support.
• The image of the king and his armies seeking victory in battle is filled with tension between fear and hope.
• Trust in God is the center of the tension between fear and hope, and it's a central theme of the Christian life.
• Learning to trust in God can be compared to learning to eat a lobster, requiring patience, practice, and persistence.
• Trusting God is a basic kind of trust that begins with believing in his existence and goodness
• Initial faith involves trusting in God's ability to answer prayers for desires and plans
• However, this view can lead to seeing God as a personal butler who grants requests when desired
• This stage of trust is marked by praying mainly for God to do things for the individual
• Growing deeper in trust requires moving beyond this shallow level and developing a more mature understanding of God's character and role
• Life experiences can lead to disappointment and distrust in God
• Disappointment can stem from unmet expectations or plans not working out as hoped
• Trusting God can shift from trusting His ability to meet our desires to trusting Him as a person, including His character, plans, and integrity
• It's natural for prayers to be focused on "why" questions when we experience disappointment, but this stage won't last forever
• There is another stage of learning to trust in God after processing disappointment and disillusionment
• The speaker describes a experience with a food item, specifically mentioning its deliciousness and richness.
• Trusting in God is compared to trusting in chariots and horses, which are seen as impressive but ultimately unreliable.
• The speaker explains that ancient kings and armies trusted in military might, but Israel was not supposed to trust in these things.
• Instead, the psalmist says to trust in the name of the Lord our God, which refers to His presence, power, and person.
• This means that when we say God's name, it is a reference to God's actions and protection, making it unnecessary to have a large army or material wealth.
• Trust in God is essential for seeing Psalm 20 in action
• Jesus' life is an example of perfect trust in God, despite pain and disappointment
• Jesus prayed to God to find another way, but ultimately submitted to God's will
• Jesus' heart was united with God's heart's desire, which was the salvation of all people
• On the cross, Jesus embodied Psalm 20 by taking on the weight of human sin and distrust, allowing us to trust in God again
• Jesus won the battle for us against sin, evil, death, and the devil through his sacrifice and self-giving love
