[2969.12 → 2979.28] probably is about health issue family relationship job or some uncertainty about future
[2979.84 → 2993.28] I don't know lord but I know real peace is not from this world real peace is from you my lord
[2993.28 → 3005.52] you have lived in this world, and you see the daily life of us you know what I need therefore
[3006.48 → 3018.64] I calm my heart in your presence so if we look at Moses word not only he said those words he also
[3018.64 → 3031.04] said that the Egyptians you see today you will never see again the lord will fight for you, you need
[3031.04 → 3040.00] only to be still he said that the Egyptians you see today yes you see I also see them
[3040.88 → 3044.00] but you see today you will never see again
[3044.00 → 3061.52] we know yes when the lord closed the Red Sea the water returned all the enemy all the army of the
[3061.52 → 3072.80] the pharaoh gone and Moses said to them the lord will fight for you, you need only to be still
[3074.00 → 3084.16] the lord Israelites so did the Israelites fight this army no the only thing they did is they obey
[3084.16 → 3096.24] what the lord told them the lord fight for you therefore when they passed through the Red Sea, and they turn
[3096.24 → 3105.44] the Red Sea closed the Red Sea closed the water remained and all those enemies that terrified them
[3105.44 → 3111.76] and now gone not even one remained
[3114.32 → 3121.28] they realized that it's not me it's not Moses our leader
[3121.28 → 3133.84] the lord is the lord is the lord fight for me brothers and sisters if you go to the life of Jesus
[3133.84 → 3147.60] you see fully obedience Jesus obey his heavenly father set up a good example for us, we come to the lord
[3148.48 → 3157.36] we quiet on our heart seek the peace in Jesus and let him guide our steps
[3157.36 → 3167.52] we remember the story that Jesus prayed in the garden of testimony we remember what he said
[3167.52 → 3184.16] he said father if you are willing remove this cup from me please if you're willing remove this cup from me
[3184.16 → 3195.60] let me nevertheless not my will not my will father but your will be done
[3195.60 → 3203.68] let me we will be done you will be done your will be done and this is what he taught us in the lord's prayer right
[3205.20 → 3219.84] let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven father not my will let your will be done
[3219.84 → 3235.20] why we said we come to Jesus and let him guide our steps because his way is higher than our way
[3235.20 → 3246.56] Jesus is the way the truth and the life he is the way
[3246.56 → 3259.04] and his way is higher than our way therefore calm down ourselves in the presence of Jesus and let
[3259.04 → 3268.80] Jesus our Lord to guide our step are not two separate issue they are like the two sides of a
[3268.80 → 3279.36] coin they're working toward the same direction whenever we are in the difficult challenging
[3279.36 → 3290.00] tough circumstance we feel so worried we come to the Lord we seek real peace
[3290.00 → 3305.92] not from news or YouTube or video games but real peace from Jesus, and we said Lord help me
[3306.56 → 3316.40] guide my way fight for me, I cannot this is so difficult this is a burden that I cannot lay
[3316.40 → 3330.24] by myself Lord help me guide my step you know there is one love you more than the whole world loves you
[3331.04 → 3344.96] he is Jesus, Jesus never forsake you his love is with you forever therefore we trust him and said Lord
[3344.96 → 3360.16] guide my step and Jesus himself set such a good example for all of us to trust in our Lord trust God
[3361.76 → 3364.72] he loved us and guide our way
[3367.52 → 3374.24] once a while I was standing at a very busy intersection of Richmond
[3374.96 → 3383.60] the people I just stand there and look at the people the surrounding traffic
[3386.64 → 3397.20] there are so many cars you can see the green light people rush and red light people are so reluctant to stop
[3397.20 → 3415.76] and I'm asking myself do they know where they are I'm not talking about geographically location I'm talking about do they know where their heart is
[3415.76 → 3420.24] do they know where they are they going
[3422.64 → 3440.40] everyone says I'm so busy I'm so busy I can't do this I can't do read the Bible every day I cannot pray every day I cannot go to church on Sunday I cannot, I'm so busy there are so many things to do I know
[3440.40 → 3448.48] when I'm standing at that intersection I'm seeing people walking passing through
[3448.48 → 3450.24] and the traffic
[3450.24 → 3453.60] I said Lord
[3453.60 → 3458.24] I don't know I don't know these people, but you know them
[3458.24 → 3461.04] Lord
[3461.04 → 3464.08] their peace
[3464.08 → 3467.92] their genuine strength
[3467.92 → 3470.16] their hope
[3470.16 → 3472.96] is not from
[3472.96 → 3474.72] where they are
[3474.72 → 3476.56] is from
[3476.56 → 3477.44] Jesus
[3477.44 → 3478.48] Jesus my Lord
[3478.48 → 3480.64] people thought that
[3480.64 → 3480.96] the
[3480.96 → 3481.44] the
[3481.44 → 3483.28] the harder I work
[3483.28 → 3484.96] the more money I gain
[3484.96 → 3486.80] therefore I have a better life
[3486.80 → 3488.40] I have a brighter future
[3488.40 → 3490.96] it may not be necessary
[3492.24 → 3494.16] sometimes things change
[3494.96 → 3499.04] and people realize that yes I did have more money
[3499.04 → 3500.88] but I lost my family
[3501.84 → 3503.44] I lost my health
[3503.44 → 3506.24] I don't know the meaning
[3506.96 → 3507.84] of my life
[3509.92 → 3510.80] so I pray
[3510.80 → 3511.68] Lord
[3512.72 → 3514.40] I don't know these people
[3515.36 → 3516.48] but you know them
[3517.36 → 3519.20] you know who they are
[3519.20 → 3520.88] you know where they're going
[3521.92 → 3525.20] and actually you know the real peace
[3526.32 → 3528.08] is not from this world
[3529.12 → 3530.88] Lord I pray that one day
[3530.88 → 3532.96] they may know Jesus
[3532.96 → 3535.60] they may turn their heart
[3536.16 → 3537.36] from the storm
[3537.36 → 3538.48] in their heart
[3538.48 → 3540.08] from the noises
[3540.08 → 3541.04] in this world
[3541.04 → 3543.12] they may turn their heart
[3544.32 → 3544.80] to you
[3546.96 → 3548.08] that's my prayer
[3550.32 → 3551.60] brothers and sisters
[3551.60 → 3554.40] I am also living in this world
[3554.40 → 3554.96] like you
[3555.60 → 3556.32] and with you
[3556.32 → 3559.36] I will say that
[3559.36 → 3561.84] even though it's my first time to be
[3561.84 → 3563.04] Latin or CRC
[3563.68 → 3564.24] I know
[3564.24 → 3567.68] our brothers and sisters living in this world
[3567.68 → 3569.52] there are so many challenges
[3570.08 → 3571.84] that we are facing every day
[3571.84 → 3575.60] I thank God
[3575.60 → 3577.44] we have Jesus
[3579.44 → 3580.32] I thank God
[3580.32 → 3583.20] Jesus bring us hope
[3583.92 → 3586.48] and the hope is not only
[3587.04 → 3588.48] when I pass away
[3589.04 → 3591.76] I know I have heavenly home
[3591.76 → 3593.68] and I know
[3593.68 → 3594.56] in this world
[3594.56 → 3595.92] I know my Lord
[3595.92 → 3596.80] that moment
[3596.80 → 3598.88] the hope
[3598.88 → 3600.48] is here
[3600.48 → 3601.92] and now
[3603.36 → 3604.00] the hope
[3604.00 → 3605.20] is I know
[3605.76 → 3607.68] my Lord is with me
[3607.68 → 3611.12] I know my Lord is holding my hand
[3611.12 → 3613.12] the hope is I know
[3613.12 → 3615.04] I am a child
[3615.04 → 3617.12] of my heavenly Father
[3617.12 → 3618.48] the hope is
[3618.48 → 3619.28] I know
[3619.28 → 3621.20] my Lord Jesus
[3621.20 → 3622.64] love me
[3622.64 → 3624.24] forever
[3624.24 → 3626.96] and I pray
[3628.24 → 3629.68] this message today
[3629.68 → 3632.16] not only help us to see
[3633.36 → 3633.76] yes
[3634.88 → 3635.76] there are fear
[3637.04 → 3638.88] there's anxious in our life
[3639.28 → 3640.08] just like
[3640.72 → 3641.92] the Israel people
[3642.40 → 3644.40] standing at the shore of the Red Sea
[3644.40 → 3645.76] the dead end
[3645.76 → 3647.60] there's no other way
[3647.60 → 3648.56] for them to go
[3649.04 → 3650.56] and the army of Pharaoh
[3650.56 → 3652.24] is marching them
[3653.76 → 3654.16] yes
[3655.28 → 3657.12] there is the word of God
[3657.12 → 3658.96] just like how Moses
[3659.60 → 3660.32] comfort them
[3661.36 → 3662.40] don't be afraid
[3663.60 → 3665.28] you will see the deliverance
[3665.84 → 3666.80] from the Lord
[3667.36 → 3669.92] because God is fighting for you
[3671.28 → 3672.96] there is Jesus
[3672.96 → 3675.36] who fully obeyed the Father
[3675.36 → 3677.20] who also suffered
[3677.20 → 3679.84] just like each one of us
[3680.64 → 3681.84] and who died
[3681.84 → 3683.60] and resurrected
[3684.56 → 3685.68] to show us
[3686.72 → 3687.20] the way
[3688.80 → 3689.52] he is
[3690.32 → 3690.80] the way
[3691.76 → 3692.48] and that
[3693.76 → 3695.28] that is hope
[3697.12 → 3697.44] that
[3698.56 → 3699.12] is hope
[3699.12 → 3703.60] the word of God
[3703.60 → 3706.64] is the spiritual food
[3707.68 → 3708.96] to his people
[3708.96 → 3711.12] so that our heart
[3711.12 → 3712.96] could be lightened
[3712.96 → 3714.40] by his word
[3715.60 → 3717.52] whenever we encounter
[3717.52 → 3719.60] the challenges in our life
[3719.60 → 3721.28] we remember
[3721.28 → 3723.04] his promise
[3724.08 → 3725.12] and his word
[3726.08 → 3726.96] in Jesus
[3727.76 → 3728.40] our Lord
[3729.92 → 3730.40] amen
[3732.40 → 3733.76] let us stand together
[3733.76 → 3736.08] sing the song of response
[3736.08 → 3745.92] as
[3747.92 → 3748.40] in Jesus
[3748.40 → 3748.88] thanks
[3748.88 → 3749.76] to the
[3749.76 → 3779.74] . . .
[3779.74 → 3786.20] You are my heart, now I've taught me to sing.
[3786.20 → 3793.16] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3794.70 → 3802.12] It is well with my soul.
[3802.12 → 3810.84] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3813.18 → 3821.00] You'll see, touch your thunder, your troubles should come.
[3821.60 → 3826.90] The peace must assurance control.
[3826.90 → 3834.90] But Christ is regarding the helpless estate.
[3836.06 → 3843.04] And the shame is the blood of my soul.
[3844.88 → 3851.54] It is well with my soul.
[3851.54 → 3860.54] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3860.54 → 3870.96] The sin of the bliss of his glory has brought.
[3871.54 → 3876.54] The sin of the pride of the Lord.
[3876.54 → 3883.54] It is well, it is well.
[3883.54 → 3893.30] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul.

[3902.30 → 3910.30] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[3910.30 → 3921.72] The Lord, praise the day when my face shall be set.
[3922.30 → 3928.30] The clouds be rolled back as a storm.
[3928.30 → 3929.30] The trust shall be set.
[3929.30 → 3934.30] The trust shall be set.
[3934.30 → 3937.30] The trust shall be set.
[3937.30 → 3938.30] The love shall discern.
[3938.30 → 3940.30] The love shall discern.
[3940.30 → 3942.30] The truth shall be set.
[3942.30 → 3959.16] The Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
[3959.16 → 3966.80] It is now, it is now, oh my God.
[3966.80 → 3989.16] We have opportunity this morning to honour God with our financial gifts, and today's offering
[3989.16 → 3994.46] is going to denominational ministries, which will support ministries of the church, both
[3994.46 → 3995.32] near and far.

[4120.32 → 4123.72] O God, how mysterious is your presence in our lives.
[4124.44 → 4129.68] We experience you as the warmth of the sun or the whistle and whisper of the breeze on a windy day.
[4130.58 → 4134.06] You are in the words that somehow form in our minds when we seek them.
[4134.06 → 4139.94] You are in our hearts as a security that holds us fast when we are troubled or afraid.
[4140.76 → 4144.96] You are in the vision that catches and tantalizes the eyes of our soul.
[4146.48 → 4149.76] But who is it that we see and feel and hear?
[4150.60 → 4151.98] Is it you, O Spirit?
[4153.20 → 4156.82] Yet you are always reminding us of our risen and ascended Saviour.
[4157.58 → 4159.78] You are our Saviour's second self.
[4160.74 → 4162.40] Is it you, O Christ?
[4162.40 → 4166.14] Yet the words that you speak are not your words either.
[4166.76 → 4169.82] They are the words you said of the one who sent you.
[4170.58 → 4172.68] You are the revelation of God to us.
[4173.56 → 4175.02] Is it you, O Creator?
[4176.20 → 4181.08] Yet you come to us only in the shape and the voice of our Saviour and the Spirit.
[4182.80 → 4187.46] Eternal Lord, you have so many forms and aspects that we may appeal to.
[4188.10 → 4190.54] And today we give you praise for who you are.
[4190.54 → 4194.28] Who you have been and who you always will be.
[4195.04 → 4199.54] You are the one constant in an ever-changing world, and we praise and thank you for that.
[4201.22 → 4206.76] God of comfort, we pray for your peace to be on Joan and Harry and their family
[4206.76 → 4211.14] as they mourn the passing of Ted Vander horst at 99 years old.

[4217.10 → 4222.08] But at the same time, we give you thanks for Ted's long and well-lived life.

[4293.96 → 4298.94] and that you will bless both Philip and Wilma in their efforts in serving you and this congregation.
[4301.18 → 4304.40] Merciful God, we continue to pray for an end to war.
[4305.18 → 4308.88] We think especially of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
[4308.88 → 4312.68] May you grant wisdom and intention to the leaders involved,
[4313.20 → 4318.84] so that the talks of peace may turn into real and concrete efforts to create a lasting end to these conflicts
[4318.84 → 4321.74] and a way forward for these regions without violence.
[4323.44 → 4325.54] Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.

[4329.06 → 4333.00] and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
