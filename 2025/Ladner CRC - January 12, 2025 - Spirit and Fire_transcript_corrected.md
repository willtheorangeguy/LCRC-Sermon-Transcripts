[0.00 → 29.98] Sitsang with Moon
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[239.98 → 240.66] Good morning, everyone.
[242.00 → 246.04] Welcome to worship today at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[246.44 → 247.70] My name is Jason True.
[247.76 → 248.74] I'm the lead pastor here.
[249.36 → 254.84] And it is my pleasure to welcome you to this time of worship, especially if you are new
[254.84 → 255.22] today.
[255.58 → 259.92] We are so glad that you have come to worship with us.
[260.04 → 263.56] And we would love to get to know you and we would love to get to know you and also to help
[263.56 → 265.58] you get to know us as a church.
[265.74 → 269.16] So maybe after the service, you can come find me and we can talk.
[269.16 → 270.16] A few announcements today.
[299.16 → 301.84] You need your help to bring some food.
[301.84 → 306.96] So there is a sign-up sheet on the foyer table for soup or buns.
[306.96 → 311.24] If you are kind of new to that idea like myself, it's another word for sandwiches.
[312.18 → 313.96] There's actually like meat and cheese in them.
[314.02 → 314.70] It's not just a roll.
[314.70 → 318.86] So you can bring sandwiches, buns or soup.
[318.94 → 320.22] We do need some more soups.
[320.72 → 321.68] So please do sign up.
[323.54 → 329.52] Our next cross-training class, it's our education class for adults, kind of Sunday school for
[329.52 → 330.22] adults.
[330.22 → 334.76] That will be starting on January 26th on the topic of politics.
[334.76 → 338.10] How are we as Christians to think about our political life?
[338.10 → 339.18] How are we to participate?
[339.72 → 341.34] What is the role of government?
[342.56 → 345.22] And so that will be coming up in a couple of weeks.
[346.84 → 352.18] Okay, so let us prepare our hearts for worship this morning.
[352.84 → 355.40] And our worship is an act of dialogue.
[356.02 → 359.90] It's a dialogue between us as God's people and God.
[361.12 → 367.80] And just as God, our Father, has called us to himself through faith in Christ,
[367.80 → 369.22] by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[369.72 → 374.76] He also calls us to worship him this morning and to worship him alone.
[375.48 → 379.64] So, people of God, would you join me in this call to worship?
[380.38 → 381.66] And we'll read it responsibly.
[383.26 → 388.20] Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvellous things.
[388.20 → 393.82] His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
[393.82 → 395.04] Together.
[395.04 → 395.08] Together.
[395.74 → 402.62] The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
[403.98 → 407.36] He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel.
[407.92 → 411.82] All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[412.96 → 415.44] Sing to the Lord a new song.
[415.96 → 419.12] His praise from the ends of the earth.
[419.12 → 426.56] God, would you join me in a prayer of adoration as we come before our Lord and praise him for who he is in prayer.
[426.68 → 427.34] Let's pray together.
[428.68 → 432.10] Almighty God, creator of the heavens and the earth.
[433.18 → 436.32] Our Father, the Father of us all.
[436.76 → 437.88] We worship you.
[438.50 → 439.58] We give thanks to you.
[439.66 → 441.34] We praise you for your glory.
[442.02 → 444.26] For you alone are the Holy One.
[444.26 → 446.98] You alone are the Lord.
[447.98 → 449.74] You are God most high.
[450.70 → 457.10] We thank you for your promise that where two or three are gathered in your name, that you will be in the midst of us.
[457.56 → 461.86] And so we ask, O Lord, that you would be present with us in this time of worship.
[463.06 → 466.20] Help us, Lord, to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[467.30 → 470.90] Would you give us hearts to believe and to trust in you?
[470.90 → 475.44] Would you open our mouths to declare your praise?
[476.38 → 490.92] Open our eyes to see Jesus Christ, our Saviour and our King, who came into this world not with power, not in might, but as a servant, to lift us up and to give us life in his name.
[491.42 → 494.02] Lord, would you abide with us, your people, this morning?
[494.32 → 499.28] Would you receive our praises for our good and for the glory of your name in all the earth?
[499.28 → 501.24] We pray and ask in Christ's name.
[501.72 → 503.70] And all God's people said, Amen.
[504.86 → 505.82] Please stand.
[506.72 → 511.04] And just as God has greeted us, well, he will do that in a minute.
[511.52 → 515.36] God has called us, and now he will greet us with these words.
[515.36 → 522.38] Those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs.
[522.90 → 529.38] Together, you make the going out of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.
[530.06 → 532.12] And may the joy of the Lord be with you.
[532.68 → 534.12] And also with you.
[534.24 → 534.76] Thank you.
[534.92 → 537.46] Let's turn and let's greet one another in the joy of the Lord.
[537.46 → 537.54] Amen.
[537.54 → 537.62] Amen.
[537.62 → 538.14] Amen.
[538.14 → 538.54] Amen.
[538.54 → 539.02] Amen.
[539.02 → 539.54] Amen.
[539.54 → 539.58] Amen.
[539.58 → 540.14] Amen.
[540.14 → 540.54] Amen.
[540.54 → 541.10] Amen.
[541.10 → 541.54] Amen.
[541.54 → 542.18] Amen.
[542.18 → 542.50] Amen.
[542.50 → 543.18] Amen.
[543.18 → 543.26] Amen.
[545.36 → 545.90] Amen.
[575.36 → 583.02] Do you always hear the critical unfit?
[592.56 → 600.26] In the early years of transition,
[600.26 → 606.48] Who else commends all the hopes of heaven?
[607.94 → 612.12] Who else could make every king bow down?
[613.58 → 618.02] Who else can whisper and darkness tremble?
[619.24 → 622.64] Holy, a holy God.
[622.64 → 652.62] Holy, a holy God.
[652.64 → 657.52] The one and the only.
[658.02 → 661.48] Cry us in holy.
[661.88 → 665.52] Forever a holy God.
[665.86 → 669.54] Come and worship the holy God.
[669.54 → 683.48] What other glory consumes like fire?
[684.62 → 688.92] What other power can raise the dead?
[688.92 → 694.80] What other name remains undefeated?
[695.80 → 699.92] Only a holy God.
[699.92 → 706.18] Come and behold him.
[706.30 → 710.22] The one and the only.
[710.80 → 714.16] Cry us in holy.
[714.80 → 718.24] Forever a holy God.
[718.24 → 723.12] Come and worship the holy God.
[723.12 → 730.04] We watch their childrenимönchel.
[730.04 → 744.38] By our love or choirs.
[744.38 → 774.36] Thank you.
[774.38 → 804.36] Thank you.
[804.38 → 834.36] Thank you.
[834.38 → 864.36] Thank you.
[864.38 → 894.36] Thank you.
[894.38 → 896.38] Thank you.
[924.38 → 926.38] Thank you.
[954.38 → 956.38] Thank you.
[984.38 → 986.38] Thank you.
[992.38 → 998.46] So today we will now be celebrating some baptisms.
[998.60 → 1001.92] And so may I invite those getting baptized to come on up?
[1001.92 → 1007.62] They are very shy.
[1007.62 → 1007.92] Thank you.
[1007.92 → 1009.92] Thank you.
[1009.92 → 1011.92] Thank you.
[1011.92 → 1013.92] Thank you.
[1013.92 → 1022.82] And so it is our joy today to baptize these brothers and sisters and to receive them into the life of our church.
[1022.82 → 1038.40] And they have all been through baptism classes with Pastor Nancy learning about the Christian faith.
[1038.40 → 1044.58] And they have all decided, the ones who are here, that they do want to be baptized.
[1044.58 → 1047.48] They want to commit their lives to knowing and following Christ.
[1047.84 → 1057.80] As a pastoral team, our elders, we got a chance to sit down with them to hear their stories and hear their, you know, their journey of coming to know the Lord Jesus.
[1057.80 → 1060.80] And it's always an encouragement and joy to do that.
[1060.80 → 1063.50] We're going to do this bilingually.
[1063.50 → 1064.00] Okay.
[1093.50 → 1112.50] So the Lord Jesus, before he ascended into heaven, he said to his disciples, go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1112.50 → 1122.50] In the day of the Holy Spirit, he said to his disciples, he said to his disciples, and to baptize them in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1122.50 → 1124.72] And so that's why we do baptize people.
[1124.72 → 1137.72] It's in obedience to Jesus who commanded us as the church to make disciples and to baptize people as a sign of their faith and of the Holy Spirit's doing that new work of life in them.
[1137.72 → 1151.72] So, for to forgive the Lord Jesus' teaching, we will pray for these people who believe in them, and to give them the blessing of their sins, and to make the Holy Spirit's doing that new work of life in them.
[1151.72 → 1154.26] And so, what is baptism?
[1154.26 → 1163.96] Just briefly, you know, like we just said, baptism is a sign of God's promises that by grace alone, he will forgive us of our sins.
[1163.96 → 1178.02] He will adopt us into his body, the church, that he will give us his Holy Spirit to change us and renew us, and that he will one day resurrect us to eternal life.
[1178.02 → 1180.02] So, what is baptism?
[1180.02 → 1185.02] baptism is that by grace alone, He will give us his Holy Spirit to give us our sins, and to give us our sins to the Holy Spirit to come and renew us.
[1185.02 → 1206.02] And so, with that introduction made, many of which is familiar to a lot of us, what I want to do is introduce you to these brothers and sisters.
[1206.02 → 1220.02] And so, we're just going to ask you to say your name, and then they each have chosen a special verse from the Bible that we will read as well.
[1220.02 → 1221.02] Thank you very much, madam.
[1221.02 → 1233.96] She's beating them in a friend.
[1233.96 → 1243.24] Master of poisoned red jumping lives, and that's when I'm reading from you from people and the praise by your Lord.
[1243.24 → 1246.04] 因为他叫日头照好人也照歹人,
[1246.38 → 1248.24] 降于给义人也给不义的人。
[1249.20 → 1249.72] Okay.
[1250.38 → 1252.66] So this is Dian Via.
[1253.58 → 1257.26] And her verse was Matthew 5, 44 to 45.
[1257.62 → 1260.06] But I tell you, love your enemies
[1260.06 → 1263.46] and pray for those who persecute you,
[1263.74 → 1266.04] that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
[1266.58 → 1269.74] He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good
[1269.74 → 1273.08] and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[1273.24 → 1274.24] Thank you.
[1303.24 → 1309.20] So this is Cathy from 1 Corinthians 13.
[1309.24 → 1310.82] Love is patient.
[1311.06 → 1311.80] Love is kind.
[1312.24 → 1312.94] It does not envy.
[1313.12 → 1313.86] It does not boast.
[1314.08 → 1314.76] It is not proud.
[1315.38 → 1316.80] It does not dishonour others.
[1317.16 → 1318.32] It is not self-seeking.
[1318.78 → 1320.20] It is not easily angered.
[1320.54 → 1322.28] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[1322.54 → 1323.92] Love does not delight in evil,
[1324.18 → 1325.84] but rejoices with the truth.
[1325.84 → 1328.48] It always protects, always trusts,
[1328.84 → 1330.84] always hopes, always perseveres.
[1330.84 → 1331.84] Thank you.
[1331.84 → 1332.84] Thank you.
[1332.84 → 1333.84] Thank you.
[1333.84 → 1334.84] Thank you.
[1334.84 → 1335.84] Thank you.
[1335.84 → 1365.84] 
[1365.84 → 1366.84] Thank you.
[1366.84 → 1367.84] Thank you.
[1367.84 → 1368.84] Thank you.
[1368.84 → 1369.84] Thank you.
[1369.84 → 1370.84] Thank you.
[1370.84 → 1371.84] Thank you.
[1371.84 → 1372.84] Thank you.
[1372.84 → 1373.84] Thank you.
[1373.84 → 1374.84] Thank you.
[1374.84 → 1375.84] Thank you.
[1375.84 → 1377.84] This is Chen Tong.
[1377.84 → 1382.84] 亲爱的弟兄, 不要自己伸冤。
[1382.84 → 1394.84] 您可让步, 听凭主怒,因为经上书者, 主说伸冤在我,我必报应。
[1398.84 → 1402.72] Okay, this is Chen Tong.
[1403.66 → 1405.94] Romans 12, verse 19.
[1405.94 → 1411.06] Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written,
[1411.60 → 1414.70] It is mine to avenge, I will repay, says the Lord.
[1435.94 → 1446.52] This is Liu Chen.
[1447.52 → 1449.62] Ephesians chapter 4, verse 2.
[1450.44 → 1452.56] Be completely humble and gentle.
[1453.56 → 1457.20] Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
[1457.20 → 1461.50] 大家好, 我是崇凤兰。
[1462.32 → 1466.74] 我最喜欢圣经以赛亚书41章10节。
[1467.74 → 1471.38] 你不要害怕, 因为我与你同在。
[1471.88 → 1475.10] 不要惊慌, 因为我是你的神。
[1475.68 → 1478.92] 我必兼顾你, 我必帮助你。
[1478.92 → 1482.46] 我必用我公义的右手扶持你。
[1488.46 → 1490.50] Okay, this is Feng LAN.
[1491.36 → 1492.48] So Isaiah 41.
[1493.68 → 1495.96] So do not fear, for I am with you.
[1496.42 → 1498.88] Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[1498.88 → 1501.16] I will strengthen you and help you.
[1501.26 → 1504.22] I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
[1504.98 → 1507.80] And so Feng LAN, she has already been baptized.
[1508.58 → 1514.18] And so she is today going to just make a profession of faith with everyone else.
[1515.56 → 1520.92] 风兰已经施洗过了, 所以今天呢,她是来确认信仰的跟大家一起。
[1520.92 → 1530.36] Okay, so friends, you have all responded to the call of the gospel to believe and to trust in the Lord Jesus.
[1531.04 → 1539.88] And so I will now ask you a few questions as a way for you to profess your faith in the Lord Jesus.
[1542.02 → 1549.52] 大家都已经靠着神的恩典来回应了福音的呼召, 并且相信,而且愿意受洗。
[1549.52 → 1556.92] 所以今天呢, 我在上帝和他的子民面前向你们表明,让你们来表明你们对基督的信仰。
[1557.80 → 1558.60] Are you ready?
[1559.64 → 1560.16] 准备好吗?
[1561.12 → 1562.26] Okay, first question.
[1564.38 → 1571.30] Do you renounce sin and the power of evil in your life and in the world?
[1572.76 → 1576.66] 你愿意在你的生活中和世界上弃绝罪恶和邪恶的力量吗?
[1578.00 → 1579.00] You can say yes.
[1579.52 → 1579.76] Okay.
[1580.76 → 1580.98] Great.
[1581.90 → 1588.94] Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your saviour, trusting in his grace and love?
[1589.80 → 1595.22] 你是否愿意转向耶稣基督并接受他为你的救主, 相信他的恩典和爱?
[1595.22 → 1596.02] Yes.
[1596.02 → 1607.24] And will you be a faithful member of this congregation and through worship and service, seek to advance God's kingdom here and throughout the world?
[1607.24 → 1615.78] 你是否愿意成为教会的忠实成员, 并通过敬拜和服侍去努力拓展上帝的国度,无论是在这里还是在世界全面?
[1615.78 → 1616.34] Yes.
[1616.34 → 1616.66] Okay.
[1616.66 → 1631.72] And may I ask you, the congregation, to please rise and to also make this vow because in baptism, we're not only united to the Lord through faith, but he brings us again into his body, the church.
[1631.72 → 1640.72] 请大家起立, 因为接着受洗,我们接纳这些受洗加入基督身体的成员进入我们这个团契。
[1640.72 → 1649.52] Do you, the people of the Lord, promise to receive these here baptized into your fellowship as members of the body of Christ?
[1650.06 → 1655.34] 主的子民, 你们是否承诺接纳这些受洗加入基督身体的成员进入团契?
[1657.48 → 1659.76] Wait, one minute. It keeps going.
[1660.16 → 1666.04] And do you promise to encourage them in the Christian faith and help them in doing the work of the Lord?
[1666.04 → 1677.04] 并承诺鼓励他们信仰耶稣基督并帮助他们勤作主公。
[1677.94 → 1681.84] Okay, ready? We do. God helping us.
[1682.28 → 1684.02] 我们愿意上帮助我们。
[1684.02 → 1685.80] Okay, thank you. You may be seated.
[1685.80 → 1696.60] So please join me in a prayer of thanksgiving and asking for God's blessing upon this sacrament of baptism.
[1696.96 → 1697.78] Let's pray together.
[1697.78 → 1705.22] We thank you, holy and gracious God, for the promises of the gospel that you seal to us in baptism,
[1705.80 → 1712.68] that Christ has died, Christ is risen, and Christ will come to bring us into his eternal kingdom.
[1712.68 → 1719.50] 圣洁慈爱的天父, 我们感谢你,在洗礼中为我们印证了福音的应许。
[1720.24 → 1728.10] 基督已经死了, 基督已经复活了,基督会再来把我们带入他永恒的国度。
[1728.10 → 1731.32] And we thank you, Lord, for the wonderful gift of baptism.
[1732.16 → 1736.62] With this water, you confirm to us that we are buried with Christ in his death,
[1736.92 → 1740.46] that we are raised to share in his resurrection,
[1741.10 → 1743.96] and that we are being renewed by the Holy Spirit.
[1743.96 → 1748.78] 主啊, 我们感谢你,赐予洗礼这奇妙的礼物。
[1748.78 → 1754.78] 你用这水向我们确认了, 我们在基督里已经与他同死,同埋葬。
[1754.78 → 1762.62] 将来, 我们要借着死礼复生来分享他的复活,并被圣灵每日更新。
[1762.62 → 1765.32] We pray, Lord, that you would pour out your Holy Spirit,
[1766.10 → 1770.14] so that these new believers may be washed clean of their sin,
[1770.56 → 1775.56] that they would be enabled to start a new way of life, a life of following you.
[1776.56 → 1781.54] 主啊, 我们求求你,现在就将你的圣灵浇灌在我们身上,

[2039.14 → 2040.44] Now, we need to pray.
[2040.44 → 2046.64] Lord, we thank you that you make us new creations in Jesus Christ through your grace alone.
[2046.98 → 2051.36] Would you bless and strengthen these brothers and sisters daily by your love and your grace.
[2052.06 → 2053.02] Deepen their faith.

[2055.88 → 2063.44] Enable them to follow after Christ as His disciples until your kingdom comes in His fullness.
[2063.90 → 2064.98] We pray in Jesus' name.

[2094.64 → 2094.96] Amen.
[2094.96 → 2096.20] Amen.
[2098.78 → 2105.28] Okay, let's all stand, and we're going to sing in response to God's grace that we witnessed the song Blessed Assurance.
[2105.28 → 2126.80] Blessed Assurance, Jesus is one
[2126.80 → 2133.12] God of the forties of glory divine
[2133.12 → 2139.40] Heirs, salvation, ages of love
[2139.40 → 2145.40] Born of His spirit, watched into His deep
[2145.40 → 2152.16] This is my story, this is my song
[2152.16 → 2158.56] Raising my Saviour all the day long
[2158.56 → 2164.84] This is my song, this is my song
[2164.84 → 2170.84] Raising my Saviour all the day long
[2170.84 → 2186.88] He implementation Woah
[2186.88 → 2192.18] Letting, or wanting a change.
[2192.50 → 2216.26] quilting people,
[2216.26 → 2223.26] Praise Him, I stay to the Lord, O it comes on.
[2224.26 → 2230.14] The works of nation, all is the rest.
[2230.66 → 2236.44] I am my Saviour, I will be the first.
[2237.06 → 2242.00] Watching and waiting, looking above.
[2242.00 → 2248.92] Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
[2249.34 → 2255.54] This is my story, this is my song.
[2256.18 → 2262.12] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[2262.50 → 2268.42] This is my story, this is my song.
[2268.42 → 2275.34] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[2275.34 → 2282.68] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[2282.68 → 2286.26] Praising my Saviour all the day long.
[2286.26 → 2292.94] So having been called by God to worship Him and having praised His name,
[2293.76 → 2297.60] obeyed His command to baptize and to disciple,
[2297.60 → 2301.20] let's come to Him now in a prayer of confession,
[2301.20 → 2305.46] where we seek to be renewed in our relationship with God
[2305.46 → 2309.28] by asking Him, again, through the blood of the cross,
[2309.28 → 2310.96] to forgive us of our sins.
[2311.44 → 2311.88] Let's pray.
[2312.94 → 2316.72] Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against You
[2316.72 → 2318.66] in thought, word, and deed,
[2319.20 → 2322.48] by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[2322.48 → 2325.36] We have not loved You with our whole hearts.
[2326.20 → 2329.24] We have not loved our neighbours as ourselves.
[2330.46 → 2334.00] We are truly sorry, Lord, and humbly repent.
[2335.02 → 2337.18] And for the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ,
[2337.26 → 2339.80] have mercy on us and forgive us
[2339.80 → 2343.90] that we may be renewed to delight in Your will
[2343.90 → 2346.36] and to walk in Your ways
[2346.36 → 2348.80] to the glory of Your name alone.
[2349.80 → 2351.00] Through Christ we pray.
[2351.48 → 2351.82] Amen.
[2352.84 → 2356.68] Now I want to give you a moment to silently confess your sins
[2356.68 → 2359.64] to the Lord, trusting in His grace.
[2378.14 → 2379.76] Hear our prayers, O Lord,
[2380.46 → 2382.04] for You are a God of mercy,
[2382.04 → 2383.12] and we need Your mercy.
[2383.78 → 2385.26] Would You forgive us our sins?
[2385.90 → 2388.02] And would You strengthen us, Lord, by Your Holy Spirit?
[2389.16 → 2391.22] Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.
[2391.86 → 2392.20] Amen.
[2393.50 → 2397.24] So people of God, in response to our cries for mercy,
[2397.24 → 2398.56] God is not silent,
[2398.76 → 2401.68] but He responds with amazing grace.
[2401.68 → 2405.88] So hear these words of assurance for all those who truly repent.
[2405.88 → 2406.88] God is light.
[2406.88 → 2407.12] Amen.
[2407.12 → 2410.92] This is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you.
[2410.92 → 2412.20] God is light.
[2412.20 → 2415.78] In Him, there is no darkness at all.
[2415.78 → 2418.88] If we claim to have fellowship with Him,
[2418.88 → 2418.98] if we claim to have fellowship with Him,
[2418.98 → 2420.76] and yet walk in the darkness,
[2420.76 → 2423.28] we lie and do not live out the truth.
[2424.12 → 2426.76] But if we walk in the light as He is in the light,
[2426.84 → 2428.88] we have fellowship with one another,
[2428.88 → 2431.56] and the blood of Jesus, His Son,
[2432.12 → 2434.16] purifies us from all sin.
[2434.16 → 2435.88] Thanks be to God.
[2436.38 → 2437.70] Let's stand one more time,
[2437.76 → 2442.10] and we'll sing a song of response to God's grace to us.
[2442.20 → 2443.40] Let's rise and let's sing.
[2443.40 → 2444.40] Amen.
[2464.16 → 2469.66] teams to us,
[2469.86 → 2473.64] sing a song of devotion for himself and everything Christ Chas evaluate us,
[2473.64 → 2476.76] we join in love, and we pray for Christ through His love.
[2476.76 → 2480.68] We Beijing day to serve His love too young people in love.
[2480.68 → 2485.56] If we wait for Him at all.
[2485.56 → 2490.02] Is there a person who whoppers and who are unto there?
[2490.02 → 2492.10] If we dig among His worshiaelages and number 2 of you?
[2492.10 → 2493.96] Next Chas achievement,
[2493.96 → 2519.96] ди
[2523.96 → 2539.62] Psalm Frozen
[2539.62 → 2543.44] from Therein
[2547.66 → 2552.08] May God
[2552.08 → 2560.04] Behold him there, the risen Lamb
[2560.04 → 2565.00] My perfect spot, his righteous face
[2565.00 → 2569.86] The great and chief jubilee I am
[2569.86 → 2574.94] The King of glory and of grace
[2574.94 → 2580.02] But with himself I cannot die
[2580.02 → 2585.04] My soul is purchased, but it's brought
[2585.04 → 2589.82] But I could speak with Christ, O God
[2589.82 → 2594.84] With Christ my Saviour, Lamb my God
[2594.84 → 2600.18] With Christ my Saviour, Lamb my God
[2610.02 → 2619.30] So at this time we will dismiss our children to go to their classes
[2619.30 → 2622.48] And we will dismiss our Chinese brothers and sisters
[2622.48 → 2627.54] To continue their worship in the fellowship fireside room
[2627.54 → 2633.10] From another night
[2633.10 → 2636.60] So at this time we will 不習 in the gospel
[2636.60 → 2637.60] And to speak
[2637.60 → 2640.42] So at this time I will see the Father's name
[2640.42 → 2641.30] And if I chasten the Who Sitsang
[2641.30 → 2642.64] So at this time I will do that
[2642.64 → 2643.36] The Very Good Father's name
[2643.36 → 2644.80] But I might do that
[2644.80 → 2646.50] And have a particular connection
[2646.50 → 2648.32] But I will accept that
[2648.32 → 2649.76] You see if coming next time I will run
[2649.76 → 2651.42] You see hi-tech
[2651.42 → 2667.92] Okay, good morning again.
[2668.92 → 2670.10] It's good to be with you.
[2670.10 → 2677.04] We have been in a sermon series over the last few weeks called Preparing the Way,
[2677.48 → 2680.94] looking at the life in the ministry of John the Baptist.
[2681.42 → 2684.10] And as we've seen, he's quite a character, right?
[2684.12 → 2686.10] This kind of wild-eyed, woolly prophet,
[2686.62 → 2692.66] who is one of the very first characters we meet in all four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[2693.58 → 2699.26] And his role was to come before Jesus to get the people ready,
[2699.50 → 2703.34] to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord.
[2704.06 → 2710.82] And we've been considering what it would mean for us to prepare the way for the Lord in our own lives.
[2712.06 → 2718.56] And so today we're going to be finishing up this series with one final passage in the Gospel of Luke.
[2718.76 → 2723.62] So I invite you, if you would like to open your pew Bibles, you can follow along there.
[2724.02 → 2727.46] We'll also have the passage on the screen, whichever works for you.
[2727.46 → 2734.60] So we will be in Luke chapter 3, verses 15 to 18, a shorter passage.
[2735.10 → 2737.94] And that is on page 764 in your pew Bible.
[2738.94 → 2739.26] 764.
[2739.26 → 2748.26] All right, the word of the Lord, beginning in verse 15.
[2748.26 → 2778.26] 
[2778.26 → 2791.80] This is the word of the Lord.
[2791.80 → 2801.70] So let's ask the Lord for his blessing upon his word as we look at it together this morning.
[2802.80 → 2809.92] Lord, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us because you love us.
[2809.92 → 2821.98] And we pray this morning that in your love, that the same Holy Spirit who first inspired these words would also today open our hearts and our ears.
[2821.98 → 2826.68] That we may hear and believe all that you have for us.
[2827.46 → 2832.18] And Lord, may you transform us more and more through your word into the image of your Son.
[2832.18 → 2836.30] As by their spirit, you apply that word to our hearts and to our lives.
[2837.00 → 2838.56] Lord, only you can do this.
[2839.14 → 2842.06] And we look to you in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[2842.60 → 2842.86] Amen.
[2844.80 → 2853.58] So you may remember a couple of years ago, we had those pretty serious wildfires up in the Okanagan Valley.
[2854.54 → 2858.26] And Todd Stat ham, who we support as a missionary at BCO,
[2858.26 → 2863.16] we were talking on a Zoom call with some of the other pastors here.
[2863.62 → 2866.42] And he said, it's like living in Mordor.
[2866.64 → 2867.48] Do you know Mordor?
[2868.12 → 2876.46] It's that land, that desolate land of fire and smoke where Sauron and his orcs live in Lord of the Rings.
[2876.96 → 2877.66] Kind of like that.
[2879.20 → 2882.08] You know, and he said, you can see the fires burning on the hills.
[2882.52 → 2886.02] There was ash floating down onto the roads and the cars.
[2886.02 → 2888.62] The sky was filled with smoke for many weeks.
[2888.74 → 2890.28] People had to evacuate their homes.
[2891.62 → 2899.00] And then, you know, this week we've been watching on the news maybe as these wildfires have come through these neighbourhoods in Los Angeles.
[2899.32 → 2900.32] And it's pretty terrifying.
[2901.02 → 2903.38] So we know that fire can be destructive.
[2904.18 → 2905.16] It can be very dangerous.
[2905.16 → 2908.52] And I want to show you this photo.
[2908.82 → 2911.80] This was taken here in British Columbia last year.
[2912.92 → 2916.30] And what do you notice here in this photo?
[2917.98 → 2918.78] New growth.
[2919.20 → 2919.38] Yeah.
[2919.90 → 2922.28] And so we see both death, and we see life.
[2922.28 → 2929.20] You know, just like the other day, I had to kind of confer with Jeremy about my painting metaphors.
[2929.28 → 2934.98] And I didn't talk to Bart here about my tree knowledge, but I hope it'll be okay.
[2935.62 → 2940.66] But, you know, we see some black charred trees, maybe dead or dying.
[2941.62 → 2944.42] But, yeah, like someone said, we see this shoot of new life.
[2944.96 → 2945.16] Right?
[2945.18 → 2946.30] We see new life coming up.
[2946.30 → 2954.18] And so we know that fire is a destructive force, but we also know that it is a natural force that brings renewal to forests.
[2955.18 → 2964.44] I also read that indigenous peoples for centuries have used controlled fires to burn off dead logs and debris to keep the forest healthy.
[2965.36 → 2973.46] And so fire for forests can be destructive, yes, but it can also help bring health to a forest.
[2973.46 → 2980.28] So that new life and new growth can begin again after the cleansing destruction of the fire.
[2981.40 → 2988.56] And that brings us to our passage today because in our text in Luke chapter 3, we have this imagery of fire.
[2989.84 → 2998.10] And just as fire can be both destructive and healing in the natural world that God has made,
[2998.10 → 3007.92] similarly, in the Bible, fire is a symbol of judgment and destruction, but it's also a symbol of new life.
[3007.92 → 3015.68] It's a symbol of the Holy Spirit and of refinement as the sin of our life gets burned away and cast off.
[3016.98 → 3021.78] And that is the work that Jesus Christ came to do.
[3021.78 → 3032.32] He is gathering people to himself, saving us from destructive fire of judgment, and he is making us whole.
[3033.56 → 3039.02] And so today we read these words about Jesus, who he is, what he came to do.
[3039.46 → 3041.24] And I have two things I want to look at today.
[3041.50 → 3046.50] First one is baptism, and then the second is the good news.
[3046.50 → 3048.88] Baptism and good news.
[3048.96 → 3049.42] Very simple.
[3050.02 → 3059.66] And of course, baptism, and we had baptisms, and so hopefully we can learn a bit more about the meaning and significance of baptism through these words today.
[3060.02 → 3063.26] So let's begin with our first point, which is baptism.
[3066.14 → 3071.44] So if you remember, John the Baptist, he is out in the wilderness, right?
[3071.44 → 3082.16] He's in that country surrounding the Jordan River, and he is there proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[3082.86 → 3092.72] And so for everyone, all these people who come who would desire to prepare the way for the Lord, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
[3092.96 → 3100.50] He would baptize them with water, symbolically washing off their old, harmful ways of life.
[3101.44 → 3103.96] To start living a new way of life.
[3104.98 → 3114.12] And so the crowds begin to think, you know, maybe this character, John the Baptist, he's a prophet.
[3114.32 → 3115.98] He speaks the words of the Lord.
[3117.14 → 3118.86] Maybe he's actually the Messiah.
[3119.98 → 3120.12] Right?
[3120.22 → 3122.40] The one we have been waiting for centuries.
[3122.40 → 3126.32] Who is going to come to make everything wrong right?
[3126.32 → 3131.20] And even, yes, who will bring judgment.
[3132.84 → 3135.24] And so look with me at verse 15 in our passage.
[3135.94 → 3142.68] It says, the people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might be the Messiah.
[3143.82 → 3145.20] And what does John say?
[3145.74 → 3149.28] He says, no, I am not the Messiah.
[3149.28 → 3153.32] Verse 16, John answered them all, I baptize you with water.
[3153.96 → 3158.14] But one who is more powerful than I will come.
[3158.88 → 3162.24] The straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
[3162.66 → 3165.74] He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
[3166.88 → 3171.60] So John, he's kind of like saying, I'm just the opening act.
[3171.60 → 3179.62] You know, when you go to a concert, often there will be an opening band who will come onto the stage first.
[3179.70 → 3180.84] And what's their job?
[3181.54 → 3186.62] It's to get everyone kind of warmed up, get everyone excited about the main act.
[3186.68 → 3191.48] So when the main act comes on stage, everyone is excited and they are ready.
[3192.64 → 3194.92] That's kind of like what John the Baptist came to do.
[3195.38 → 3196.68] He's the opening act.
[3196.68 → 3201.40] He came to get the people ready for the main act, who is Jesus.
[3202.56 → 3207.44] And part of this opening act that John performed was to baptize people with water.
[3208.28 → 3210.78] And it symbolized true repentance.
[3211.78 → 3218.44] It symbolized a true readiness to put their trust in the coming King.
[3219.84 → 3228.72] And that's why when Jesus comes, John says, he will baptize you, not with water, not as a symbol,
[3228.72 → 3231.56] but with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
[3233.00 → 3236.68] John's baptism is a symbol of change, a symbol of repentance.
[3237.54 → 3240.72] Jesus' baptism truly changes us.
[3242.64 → 3248.88] And so now when John says that Jesus, when he comes, he's going to baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire,
[3249.66 → 3250.52] what does that mean?
[3251.10 → 3252.82] That's kind of the question that we have today.
[3252.82 → 3255.30] And so let's think about each of those in turn.
[3256.26 → 3260.12] So first, John says that Jesus will come and baptize with the Holy Spirit.
[3260.74 → 3262.46] Not with water, but with the Holy Spirit.
[3263.02 → 3270.16] In other words, in that symbolism, he will, the Holy Spirit, you know, the water coming over your body,
[3270.38 → 3274.74] dripping all over your body, whether you are immersed, whether the water goes over your head.
[3274.74 → 3278.82] And in the same way, the Holy Spirit will envelop you.
[3279.36 → 3284.24] He will surround you with his presence, the presence of God.
[3285.22 → 3291.66] And it's like, actually, not only on the outside, but on the inside, you become a temple of God.
[3292.36 → 3295.80] Where the Holy Spirit, God, takes up residence in your life.
[3296.78 → 3299.80] And of course, this was all fulfilled on the day of Pentecost.
[3299.80 → 3302.82] Right? Jesus, he had died on the cross.
[3302.96 → 3307.60] He rose again from the dead, opening up this new way for us to relate to God.
[3308.52 → 3315.06] And then before he ascended into heaven, remember, he gathered his disciples and he gave them a command.
[3315.94 → 3316.80] What did Jesus say?
[3316.94 → 3319.04] Let's look at Acts chapter 1.
[3320.72 → 3327.44] Jesus said, do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
[3327.44 → 3332.54] And look, for John baptized with water.
[3333.26 → 3337.32] But in a few days, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[3337.80 → 3339.62] Okay, so that connects to our passage today.
[3340.62 → 3348.34] And as Jesus' disciples, as they gathered in that upper room, they're praying, waiting, obeying Jesus, waiting for this promise,
[3348.68 → 3349.56] the Holy Spirit came.
[3350.12 → 3352.38] And it came with a sound of rushing wind.
[3352.38 → 3358.52] It came, like, visibly as of tongues of fire that came to rest on each individual.
[3359.76 → 3370.74] And it was all to fulfill the great prophecy of the Old Testament that one day, God was going to pour out his Holy Spirit on all people, individually, who love and fear him.
[3372.26 → 3377.36] You know, and friends, the Holy Spirit is not some impersonal force.
[3377.68 → 3379.10] He's not some energy force.
[3379.10 → 3380.88] But it is the Holy Spirit of God.
[3380.96 → 3384.04] It is God himself, the third person of the Trinity.
[3384.72 → 3384.84] Right?
[3384.90 → 3385.64] This is a great mystery.
[3386.78 → 3393.90] And so through faith in Jesus Christ, the living Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, comes and lives within us.
[3394.62 → 3399.48] And he enables us and empowers us to share in the very life of God.
[3400.28 → 3400.50] Right?
[3400.54 → 3404.54] To live a new way of life that glorifies God.
[3404.54 → 3408.04] And so that's the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
[3408.18 → 3408.34] Right?
[3408.42 → 3409.30] And that's awesome.
[3409.38 → 3409.96] We love that.
[3410.58 → 3411.42] That's the good part.
[3412.04 → 3413.30] But that's not all John says.
[3414.08 → 3420.04] The second part is that John, or that Jesus, will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire.
[3420.96 → 3421.68] And fire.
[3422.32 → 3424.20] So there's that fire imagery again.
[3424.20 → 3431.02] And on the positive side, like we said, the whole, you know, fire represents the Holy Spirit coming upon us.
[3431.24 → 3432.86] It's a symbol of purification.
[3433.60 → 3441.48] It's an image of how that Holy Spirit refines us and transforms us, changes us, as fire refines metal.
[3441.48 → 3455.20] But the immediate context of that verse, and while we need to keep this other imagery in mind, the immediate context helps us understand what John means here by fire.
[3456.04 → 3457.92] So let's look at verse 17.
[3459.54 → 3460.64] John goes on to say,
[3460.64 → 3475.82] So this is a metaphor.
[3476.74 → 3487.50] And winnowing, as I'm sure I or others have explained, is just a way that farmers would toss the harvested wheat up into the air.
[3487.50 → 3495.98] And those heavier heads of grain, the edible part, would fall down, and the wind would blow the chaff away.
[3497.44 → 3502.92] And it's a process that John's hearers would have been completely familiar with.
[3503.78 → 3503.92] Right?
[3504.00 → 3510.74] And so they would gather the grain, the food, into the barn, and they would make bread and eat it.
[3511.42 → 3515.32] But the chaff that gets kind of blown away, what do you do with that?
[3515.32 → 3518.86] Well, you know, you gather it up and you burn it.
[3519.04 → 3520.04] That's how you dispose of it.
[3521.28 → 3524.68] And this is what the Messiah is going to do.
[3525.84 → 3529.62] And so there are two aspects of this image that John gives us here.
[3529.78 → 3534.16] There's division, separation, and there is destruction.
[3535.26 → 3539.18] So first, part of Jesus' ministry is one of division.
[3540.04 → 3541.22] It's one of separation.
[3541.22 → 3545.02] He will divide the wheat from the chaff.
[3546.38 → 3551.56] And in Luke chapter 12, verses 49 to 53, Jesus says this.
[3551.64 → 3553.24] Let's look at this passage.
[3553.78 → 3555.04] This is Luke chapter 12.
[3555.04 → 3566.44] I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled, but I have a baptism to undergo, referring to his suffering and cross,
[3567.00 → 3570.74] and what constraint I am under until it is completed.
[3571.78 → 3573.98] Do you think I came to bring peace on earth?
[3574.76 → 3576.42] No, I tell you, but division.
[3577.28 → 3583.42] From now on, there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two, and two against three.
[3583.42 → 3595.84] They will be divided, father against son, son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
[3595.84 → 3602.28] Now, you know, we read these words of Jesus.
[3602.74 → 3604.44] You know, these are red-letter words.
[3604.54 → 3607.36] You know, you sometimes have a Bible, and it has the words of Jesus in red.
[3607.74 → 3608.88] These are the words of Jesus.
[3609.80 → 3615.90] And they sound harsh, and maybe it's not usually the way we think about Jesus and his teachings.
[3615.90 → 3619.12] But they are the very words of Jesus.
[3619.78 → 3621.64] They are words coming out of his mouths.
[3621.86 → 3632.22] And even those who are most skeptical of the truthfulness of the Bible, they would even say it's those harsher words that are likely most true.
[3632.82 → 3635.22] Now, we believe that all of his words are true.
[3636.36 → 3640.62] Okay, but if you want to think in that way, this is especially probably true.
[3640.62 → 3651.02] And Jesus says that he came not only to bring salvation, which he absolutely says, but he also came to be this great divider.
[3651.66 → 3658.90] The great divider of humanity as people decide whether they will follow Jesus.
[3661.48 → 3669.10] There will be those who hear the gospel and who will bend their knees because they recognize, and they know who the king is.
[3669.10 → 3678.64] But there will be those who continue to rebel, who will hear and see all that Jesus said and did, and still will reject him.
[3680.12 → 3683.88] Sometimes it happens, even as Jesus said, within our own families.
[3684.78 → 3692.28] And when Jesus says, I have come to bring fire on the earth, he's referring to that fire of division between believers and unbelievers.
[3692.40 → 3693.90] The repentant, the unrepentant.
[3694.30 → 3694.50] Right?
[3694.56 → 3695.60] The sheep and the goats.
[3696.34 → 3697.60] The righteous, the unrighteous.
[3697.60 → 3699.84] The Bible uses all of these different images.
[3701.30 → 3707.06] So that's this aspect of division, like the wheat and the chaff being separated.
[3708.26 → 3713.90] But then there's a second aspect of this image that's also not only division, but destruction.
[3714.74 → 3717.24] And I know this is a heavy part, so just hang with me.
[3718.54 → 3720.96] Jesus says that this is what the Messiah is going to do.
[3720.96 → 3728.18] He's going to burn up or bring destruction or judgment on everything and anyone who opposes the things of God.
[3729.08 → 3732.74] Who oppose the righteousness, the justice, the holiness of God.
[3732.74 → 3740.56] And by saying then that Jesus will baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire, he is saying these two things.
[3741.48 → 3744.64] Jesus brings salvation and Jesus brings judgment.
[3745.52 → 3752.86] Jesus brings salvation, union with God, forgiveness of sins, God making his dwelling with us by the Spirit.
[3752.86 → 3761.20] And Jesus brings judgment for all those who decide whether to believe in him.
[3761.82 → 3766.36] This unquenchable fire that divides the wheat from the chaff and that burns up the chaff.
[3766.36 → 3773.28] And so that is what it means that Jesus will baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
[3773.92 → 3777.22] That he is the Messiah that is to come.
[3778.28 → 3782.06] Who comes with salvation and who comes with judgment.
[3782.88 → 3785.22] The salvation part, we like that part.
[3786.10 → 3788.84] The judgment part, that's a little disconcerting.
[3789.80 → 3794.06] Maybe it doesn't align with our own expectations of whom the Messiah is.
[3794.06 → 3796.80] I mean, Jesus was busting everybody's expectations.
[3797.60 → 3801.98] Sometimes it can not quite fit with ours as well.
[3802.28 → 3808.66] And that's why, you know, we probably find it kind of strange that this image of judgment is then immediately followed by verse 18.
[3808.96 → 3810.64] And that leads us to our second point today.
[3812.10 → 3815.34] The second point is good news.
[3815.34 → 3826.66] John sees this message of Jesus coming in judgment as good news.
[3827.54 → 3829.48] And there's a lot we could say about this.
[3829.66 → 3831.92] But, well, first let's look at verse 18.
[3833.26 → 3834.72] And this is how our passage ends.
[3834.82 → 3840.94] With many other words, Jesus exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.
[3840.94 → 3841.38] Right?
[3842.06 → 3846.82] And so I don't know about you, but as we read this kind of hard words, and then it says,
[3847.60 → 3850.30] and this is the good news that John was proclaiming.
[3850.34 → 3852.02] And so how do we get our minds around that?
[3854.24 → 3855.98] Do we, you know, maybe we find that a little surprising.
[3856.12 → 3857.46] How is this all good news?
[3857.72 → 3858.68] Well, here's the thing.
[3858.68 → 3864.08] Whether Jesus is coming to baptize with the fire and the Holy Spirit,
[3864.20 → 3869.96] whether that is to you the good news of salvation or the bad news of judgment,
[3869.96 → 3872.12] it depends on your response to Jesus.
[3873.12 → 3873.56] Right?
[3873.58 → 3874.62] It depends on your response.
[3875.86 → 3877.56] Let's go back to our setting.
[3878.48 → 3879.46] John the Baptist, right?
[3879.56 → 3881.00] He's out in the wilderness.
[3881.26 → 3882.60] He's by the River Jordan.
[3884.22 → 3888.44] Wild-eyed, woolly, hairy prophet, proclaiming the word of the Lord.
[3889.22 → 3890.60] Baptizing people in the river.
[3891.08 → 3897.88] Now, the people in that crowd listening to John, we can safely assume that they would know what he is doing.
[3898.18 → 3899.38] They understand baptism.
[3900.14 → 3905.82] John the Baptist did not, we call him John the Baptist, but no Baptist jokes.
[3906.40 → 3909.06] But, you know, he didn't invent baptism.
[3909.84 → 3911.46] It was a known custom, actually.
[3911.46 → 3919.34] And it was something that Gentiles, a non-Jew, would receive to become clean.
[3920.20 → 3920.60] Why?
[3921.60 → 3927.10] Because it was well understood among the Jews that Gentiles lived immoral lives.
[3927.78 → 3929.78] That they lived lives displeasing to God.
[3930.56 → 3934.52] And so if you wanted to become part of the people of God, if you wanted to worship the one true God,
[3935.00 → 3936.38] you would get baptized.
[3936.84 → 3943.58] You would cleanse yourself from your, you know, ways of displeasing God, and you would seek to worship God.
[3943.58 → 3948.98] And so the crowd, they would all know about baptism, that it was something for the Gentiles.
[3949.80 → 3952.02] They needed it, not the Jews.
[3952.64 → 3954.26] But what's John saying?
[3954.26 → 3963.46] He's talking to the Jewish tax collectors, Jewish soldiers, a crowd of fellow Judeans.
[3963.82 → 3967.08] And he says, everybody needs to be baptized.
[3968.54 → 3969.10] Right?
[3969.22 → 3970.46] Everybody needs to be baptized.
[3970.70 → 3972.04] Every one of you needs this.
[3972.50 → 3974.16] And people hearing this are shocked.
[3975.14 → 3977.06] Some people are offended.
[3978.30 → 3980.40] Baptism is not for everybody, not for me.
[3981.90 → 3983.10] But who comes?
[3983.10 → 3984.58] Who comes to be baptized?
[3985.26 → 3986.60] Who gets in the river?
[3987.36 → 3994.22] Who is willing to undergo in humility and acknowledge that they are not clean?
[3994.82 → 3996.10] It's the tax collectors.
[3997.10 → 4000.14] It's the soldiers who brutalize people.
[4000.68 → 4005.58] It is the crowds, the everyday people, who are not so moral or religious.
[4007.16 → 4010.22] It's the ones who knew they needed it.
[4010.64 → 4012.04] Who come to be washed.
[4012.04 → 4019.04] And to them, and only to them, is the gospel good news.
[4020.20 → 4026.90] To them, and only to them, is the embrace of God a gift that you cannot earn.
[4027.58 → 4029.80] But that is received as a free grace.
[4031.48 → 4033.62] And John knew this for himself.
[4034.90 → 4035.02] Right?
[4035.10 → 4036.08] John was this prophet.
[4036.08 → 4037.24] Yes, he was great.
[4037.36 → 4041.48] Jesus even said, John is the greatest prophet.
[4041.62 → 4045.72] He is, of all men born of women, he is the greatest of all.
[4047.66 → 4048.96] But he was also flawed.
[4049.80 → 4051.54] He was a man who needed grace.
[4051.54 → 4056.74] And that's why John says in verse 16,
[4057.42 → 4065.76] There is one more powerful than me who will come whose sandals I am not even worthy to untie.
[4066.26 → 4066.40] Right?
[4066.68 → 4068.84] He says, I am lower than a slave.
[4069.54 → 4073.82] I'm not even worthy to do the job of a slave, which was to untie sandals.
[4073.82 → 4076.52] I'm not even that worthy.
[4077.64 → 4086.84] And if the whole point is, if that is how you respond to Jesus, knowing that you need cleansing, that you need forgiveness, that you need grace,
[4086.84 → 4094.48] then the baptism that Jesus will give to you, a baptism of true cleansing, the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[4095.38 → 4101.48] it will be for you a baptism of belonging, where he forgives your sins.
[4101.84 → 4103.70] He welcomes you into God's family.
[4104.38 → 4105.60] He fills you with his spirit.
[4105.92 → 4109.52] He shares with you his eternal life so that you can live with him forever.
[4109.52 → 4119.74] And if you put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ, the fires of God's judgment will refine you rather than consume you.
[4121.42 → 4127.86] They will burn off the sin and do away with it and change us and make us more like the Lord himself,
[4127.96 → 4130.36] even though this is an uncomfortable process.
[4131.50 → 4135.10] That was the message that John proclaimed as he prepared the way for Jesus.
[4135.10 → 4148.60] And, you know, but I suspect that John, even for him, that the way Jesus behaved as the Messiah surpassed even his wildest expectations.
[4149.38 → 4152.56] No one really knew what to expect with this Messiah.
[4154.12 → 4158.96] And this is how I think Jesus' behaviour probably shocked even John.
[4159.86 → 4164.04] Because if we jump to the Gospel of John, a different John, but the Gospel of John,
[4164.04 → 4166.26] we discover something profound.
[4167.34 → 4171.82] We discover that the one whose sandals that John was not even worthy to untie
[4171.82 → 4176.40] is the very same one who washed his disciples' feet.
[4177.34 → 4178.62] Right? Do you remember that?
[4178.86 → 4180.86] Look, let's read John chapter 13.
[4182.74 → 4186.60] Jesus, he knew that the Father had put all things under his power,
[4186.84 → 4189.70] that he had come from God and was returning to God.
[4189.70 → 4195.34] So, as the Messiah, he got up from the meal,
[4195.86 → 4200.02] he took off his outer clothing, wrapped a towel around his waist.
[4200.88 → 4205.66] After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet,
[4206.22 → 4208.60] drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[4211.10 → 4215.10] This is the one John said was more powerful than he,
[4215.10 → 4218.92] who came from God and was returning to God.
[4218.98 → 4219.78] He is God.
[4220.28 → 4222.62] And yet, this is how he exercises his power.
[4222.92 → 4225.24] He takes the position of a lowly servant.
[4226.58 → 4231.94] And he does the only task that is lower than untying someone's sandals.
[4233.08 → 4233.86] Which is what?
[4234.92 → 4236.36] To wash their feet.
[4238.32 → 4240.20] Friends, that is what Jesus came to do.
[4240.40 → 4241.68] He came to serve us.
[4241.68 → 4244.66] And, you know, we might not understand judgment,
[4245.28 → 4247.46] especially in our day, in our, you know,
[4247.90 → 4252.78] a developed country where we don't really suffer injustice or a lot of things.
[4253.50 → 4256.54] We might not understand how it will all work out,
[4257.44 → 4258.96] but we can trust Jesus.
[4259.66 → 4262.86] Because he is the one who came on bended knee,
[4263.32 → 4264.74] who washed our feet,
[4265.00 → 4266.50] who invited us into the kingdom,
[4266.64 → 4268.74] who died and rose again for us,
[4268.80 → 4270.12] who gave us his Holy Spirit,
[4270.12 → 4273.04] and who leads us into the very life of God.
[4273.04 → 4275.52] And he does it all before the judgment comes.
[4277.14 → 4280.00] And so, how do you respond to this Jesus?
[4281.34 → 4284.62] Do you humble yourself before him?
[4285.14 → 4287.54] Do you receive his grace, his gift?
[4289.40 → 4292.32] And if you come to his cross in this way,
[4292.72 → 4295.38] he welcomes you into his house forever.
[4296.44 → 4299.40] And the Bible says that there's nothing you have to do to please God.
[4299.40 → 4304.26] But only to marvel at what Jesus has done for you.
[4305.44 → 4306.38] Let's pray.
[4306.38 → 4319.22] O Lord,
[4319.38 → 4322.54] would you help us to marvel,
[4323.22 → 4325.04] to wonder,
[4326.80 → 4332.52] to surpass our expectations of who you are,
[4332.52 → 4334.74] and what you are doing,
[4334.74 → 4336.66] and why you are doing it,
[4337.36 → 4339.14] and to see that even I,
[4340.24 → 4341.62] Lord,
[4341.68 → 4344.30] can become a child of God,
[4344.38 → 4345.98] a citizen of your kingdom.
[4347.08 → 4348.38] Not because I,
[4349.12 → 4349.26] Lord,
[4349.32 → 4349.86] am clean
[4349.86 → 4351.80] in my own righteousness,
[4352.10 → 4352.96] in my own morality,
[4353.64 → 4354.18] but Lord,
[4354.44 → 4355.04] because
[4355.04 → 4357.62] you have given us your Holy Spirit,
[4357.62 → 4360.18] and you have cleansed us.
[4361.10 → 4361.62] And so,
[4361.72 → 4361.82] Lord,
[4361.88 → 4362.48] help us
[4362.48 → 4364.30] to
[4364.30 → 4367.42] see you on bended knee,
[4367.94 → 4370.76] to see your love for us,
[4370.78 → 4371.84] and that we would respond,
[4372.00 → 4372.98] having our hearts warmed
[4372.98 → 4375.16] by your sacrifice,
[4375.16 → 4377.70] so that we would be willing,
[4377.70 → 4378.98] to follow you.
[4379.06 → 4379.16] Lord,
[4379.22 → 4380.24] you don't force us,
[4381.28 → 4381.60] but Lord,
[4381.68 → 4382.84] will we see your loveliness,
[4383.48 → 4384.44] and your love,
[4384.78 → 4386.44] that we would be so attracted to you,
[4387.08 → 4388.52] that we would respond,
[4388.78 → 4389.32] to follow you.
[4389.98 → 4391.00] We pray in Jesus name.
[4391.38 → 4391.60] Amen.
[4391.60 → 4391.72] Amen.
[4395.42 → 4395.86] Okay.
[4396.26 → 4396.98] Let's stand,
[4397.54 → 4398.48] sing a song of response.
[4398.48 → 4398.60] Amen.
[4421.60 → 4422.32] Amen.
[4422.62 → 4423.34] Amen.
[4423.34 → 4424.44] Amen.
[4424.44 → 4424.54] Amen.
[4424.72 → 4425.66] Amen.
[4425.68 → 4426.68] Amen.
[4426.82 → 4427.62] Amen.
[4430.54 → 4431.40] Amen.
[4433.54 → 4434.48] Amen.
[4438.48 → 4439.94] Amen.
[4439.94 → 4441.40] Amen.
[4445.12 → 4446.56] Amen.
[4450.66 → 4450.92] Amen.
[4450.92 → 4451.44] Amen.
[4451.60 → 4460.32] My all in all, here in the help of Christ I stand.
[4469.38 → 4480.14] In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless pain.
[4480.14 → 4490.14] This gift of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones he came to save.
[4491.22 → 4501.14] Till on that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[4501.14 → 4512.14] For every sin on him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[4512.14 → 4527.14] No guilt in life, no fear in death.
[4528.56 → 4533.20] This is the power of Christ in me.
[4533.20 → 4542.98] From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny.
[4542.98 → 4553.98] No power of hell, no single man, can ever pluck me from his hand.
[4554.88 → 4564.98] Till he returns or calls me home, here in the power of Christ I stand.
[4564.98 → 4565.98] Amen.
[4584.70 → 4588.40] So we continue to worship the Lord by the giving of our tithes and our offerings.
[4588.40 → 4592.60] And our designated offering for this week is called Reframe Ministries.
[4592.80 → 4600.38] This is a publishing arm, an outreach ministry of our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church.
[4601.02 → 4606.70] And it's like through the stories of who God is, they seek to rewrite the stories of people's lives.
[4606.74 → 4608.68] To reframe the story in a sense.
[4609.14 → 4615.08] And they do this by publishing evangelistic material, discipleship materials, and all kinds of languages around the world.
[4615.08 → 4616.84] So really important ministry.
[4617.30 → 4619.66] And so that is our designated offering for today.
[4620.26 → 4621.46] May I invite the...
[4621.46 → 4621.68] Yes?
[4623.42 → 4625.00] It used to be called Back to God Hour.
[4626.06 → 4626.44] Thanks.
[4626.54 → 4628.40] For a lot of us who know it in that way, right?
[4628.58 → 4628.72] Okay.
[4629.62 → 4632.12] Could I ask our deacons to collect the offering?
[4632.12 → 4632.24] Thank you.
[4645.34 → 4645.58] Amen.
[4645.58 → 4646.58] Amen.
[4646.58 → 4651.74] Amen.
[4651.74 → 4651.92] Amen.
[4656.14 → 4657.70] Amen.
[4658.22 → 4658.64] Amen.
[4658.64 → 4658.76] Amen.
[4658.82 → 4659.08] Amen.
[4663.50 → 4663.82] Amen.
[4663.82 → 4664.16] Amen.
[4664.16 → 4666.02] Amen.
[4670.90 → 4671.12] Amen.
[4671.12 → 4671.30] Amen.
[4671.36 → 4672.16] Amen.
[4673.40 → 4674.18] Amen.
[4674.18 → 4676.18] Amen.
[4704.18 → 4706.18] Amen.
[4734.18 → 4736.18] Amen.
[4764.18 → 4766.18] Amen.
[4766.18 → 4767.18] Amen.
[4767.18 → 4768.18] Amen.
[4768.18 → 4770.18] Amen.
[4770.18 → 4772.18] Amen.
[4772.18 → 4774.18] Amen.
[4774.18 → 4776.18] Amen.
[4776.18 → 4780.18] So our God now invites us to bring our requests before him.
[4780.18 → 4782.18] And he loves it.
[4782.18 → 4785.18] When we as his children rely on him.
[4785.18 → 4791.18] And so let's pray for the needs of our church and for the world now.
[4791.18 → 4793.18] So would you join me in prayer?
[4793.18 → 4801.18] Heavenly Father, we come to you giving thanks for your grace in our lives.
[4801.18 → 4806.18] We come in the confidence that you do hear our prayers.
[4806.18 → 4812.18] For you have qualified us in Christ to share in your inheritance.
[4812.18 → 4818.18] You have transferred us into his kingdom, the kingdom of your beloved son.
[4818.18 → 4821.18] And so we lift some of the needs of the world to you.
[4821.18 → 4823.18] And Lord, there are so many needs.
[4823.18 → 4827.18] But this morning we pray for the wildfires in Los Angeles.
[4827.18 → 4831.18] Lord, we ask that you would have mercy on those who have lost homes and property.
[4831.18 → 4835.18] Especially, Lord, those who have lost loved ones.
[4835.18 → 4838.18] And Lord, we ask that you would help the firefighters.
[4838.18 → 4842.18] That you would have your hand over the works of nature.
[4842.18 → 4849.18] And that you would bring an end, Lord, to the destruction of these fires.
[4849.18 → 4855.18] Lord, we pray for our church this morning.
[4855.18 → 4858.18] We thank you, Lord, for the baptisms that we witnessed earlier.
[4858.18 → 4862.18] We thank you for the new life that comes from your Holy Spirit.
[4862.18 → 4870.18] That where, whereas once our eyes were blind to you.
[4870.18 → 4874.18] Lord, we hear the gospel news and you open our eyes.
[4874.18 → 4877.18] And we see you, and we see who, what you've done for us.
[4877.18 → 4878.18] And we respond, Lord.
[4878.18 → 4880.18] And it's only by your grace.
[4880.18 → 4886.18] And Lord, would you continue to nurture that seed of the gospel planted in the hearts of these brothers and sisters.
[4886.18 → 4892.18] So that it would continue, that they would continue to grow in their knowledge and their love for you.
[4892.18 → 4895.18] Their willingness to obey you in all life.
[4895.18 → 4898.18] And produce fruit, Lord, for your kingdom.
[4898.18 → 4906.18] Lord, we also pray for your church in all places as your people gather in your name this morning.
[4906.18 → 4908.18] People from all nations.
[4908.18 → 4911.18] Lord, we pray for the unity of all believers everywhere.
[4911.18 → 4916.18] Lord, you prayed that the world would know you through our love for one another.
[4916.18 → 4922.18] So we pray, Lord, that you would give us that strong sense of unity that we have as your church.
[4922.18 → 4927.18] That is deeper than those small differences that divide us.
[4927.18 → 4932.18] Lord, you came into our world as the light, and you called us to be light.
[4932.18 → 4937.18] And so may your church live as the light in the world.
[4937.18 → 4944.18] Lord, would you help us to shine your grace into the darkest corners.
[4944.18 → 4950.18] Would you help us to illuminate the beauty of what you are doing in renewing all things.
[4950.18 → 4959.18] Lord, would you give us a warmth, empowered by your spirit that seeks to bring healing to all it touches.
[4959.18 → 4964.18] Lord, not through us and not for our names, but for your name.
[4964.18 → 4971.18] Lord, we pray that those in your church here this morning even that feel discouraged.
[4971.18 → 4974.18] Would your Holy Spirit breathe new life into us.
[4974.18 → 4976.18] Whether we're feeling spiritually dry.
[4976.18 → 4980.18] Whether we are wrestling with doubts.
[4980.18 → 4983.18] Whether we are facing trials.
[4983.18 → 4989.18] Lord, would you help us not to hear and listen to the lies of the enemy.
[4989.18 → 4992.18] Would you help us to listen to your voice.
[4992.18 → 4994.18] Encourage us by your spirit.
[4994.18 → 5000.18] Bind up areas of doubt and kindle a joy that delights in you.
[5000.18 → 5004.18] Lord, we ask that you would continue to purify your church.
[5004.18 → 5009.18] We long for the day when every wrong will be made right.
[5009.18 → 5012.18] Even, Lord, in our own hearts.
[5012.18 → 5016.18] Everything broken, restored, even in our church.
[5016.18 → 5022.18] And until then, Lord, cleanse your bride as you promise.
[5022.18 → 5026.18] Make us holy for your sake.
[5026.18 → 5031.18] And, Heavenly Father, would you grant these prayers for the sake of Jesus Christ,
[5031.18 → 5035.18] who is our mediator and advocate before the Father,
[5035.18 → 5040.18] who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
[5040.18 → 5041.18] Amen.
[5043.18 → 5048.18] Let's all stand, and we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5048.18 → 5054.18] And so for our time of fellowship after this service, we will just be in the foyer.
[5054.18 → 5061.18] The Chinese ministry is using the Fellowship Hall to hear testimonies of these who were baptized
[5061.18 → 5064.18] and to kind of have a little celebratory lunch.
[5064.18 → 5067.18] And so do join us for a time of coffee, though.
[5067.18 → 5072.18] And I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of the Lord's blessing upon you.
[5072.18 → 5078.18] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[5078.18 → 5081.18] be with each one of you today and always. Amen.
[5084.18 → 5091.18] One-star burns in the darkness, shines with the promise, Emmanuel.
[5091.18 → 5104.18] One-star burns in the darkness, shines with the promise, Emmanuel.
[5104.18 → 5116.18] One child born in the stillness, living within us, Emmanuel.
[5116.18 → 5117.18] One-star burns in the darkness, shines with the love of God.
[5117.18 → 5128.18] We're singing glory, glory, let there be peace, let there be peace.
[5128.18 → 5137.18] Singing glory, glory, let there be peace, let there be peace.
[5137.18 → 5150.18] One voice speaks for the voiceless, hope for the hopeless, Emmanuel.
[5150.18 → 5152.18] One love brings us together, one love brings us together.
[5152.18 → 5163.18] One love brings us together, now and forever, Emmanuel.
[5163.18 → 5173.60] Sing glory, glory, let there be peace, let there be peace.
[5173.60 → 5190.24] Sing glory, glory, let there be peace, let there be peace, let it start in me.
[5193.18 → 5223.16] Thank you.
