[580.00 --> 581.00]  Amen.
[581.00 --> 583.00]  Please be seated.
[583.00 --> 599.00]  Our help is in the name of God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[599.00 --> 606.00]  We are gathered in the presence of God to remember and thank God for the life of Elizabeth Bixma,
[606.00 --> 609.00]  who we all knew as Ellie.
[609.00 --> 614.00]  She was a beloved mother, grandmother, great grandmother and friend.
[614.00 --> 621.00]  My name is Tom Baumhoff and I am a pastor here in the lower mainland, just recently moved.
[621.00 --> 624.00]  I was pastor for Connie's church.
[624.00 --> 627.00]  I met Ellie when she visited.
[627.00 --> 632.00]  I know my wife has met her at Grandparents Day at Surrey Christian School.
[632.00 --> 636.00]  It's my honor to lead you in this service.
[636.00 --> 640.00]  Ellie died at peace, surrounded by her family.
[640.00 --> 650.00]  And her loss leaves us with tears even as we celebrate her life and thank God for this gift that she is and she was.
[650.00 --> 661.00]  Ellie's body was committed to the grave this afternoon at Boundary Bay Cemetery, surrounded by family, by prayers and by faith.
[661.00 --> 666.00]  And so we are here now to remember and to celebrate her life.
[666.00 --> 678.00]  We are here to tell stories, to smile, to cry, to feel all the feelings that we have, to sing songs of faith,
[678.00 --> 685.00]  to commend into God's care, Ellie's family and to pray for all of us who grieve her death.
[685.00 --> 691.00]  And to receive the comfort of the gospel of our good shepherd, Jesus.
[691.00 --> 700.00]  And the family thanks you for coming today to support them, to show them great care.
[700.00 --> 703.00]  And your presence here means a lot to them.
[703.00 --> 706.00]  And they draw strength from your support.
[706.00 --> 715.00]  And after the service, you're invited to stay in the fellowship room for coffee and refreshments.
[715.00 --> 721.00]  And as we enter into this moment, we claim the blessing that Jesus promised us when he said,
[721.00 --> 726.00]  Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[726.00 --> 730.00]  And Jesus says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[730.00 --> 733.00]  He who believes in me will live, even though he dies.
[733.00 --> 737.00]  And whoever lives and believes in me will never die.
[737.00 --> 742.00]  And the apostle Paul writes, If we live, we live to the Lord.
[742.00 --> 745.00]  And if we die, we die to the Lord.
[745.00 --> 749.00]  So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
[749.00 --> 752.00]  Let's pray.
[753.00 --> 757.00]  O Lord, you have searched me and you know me.
[757.00 --> 760.00]  You know when I sit and when I rise.
[760.00 --> 762.00]  You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[762.00 --> 765.00]  You discern my going out and my lying down.
[765.00 --> 768.00]  You are familiar with all my ways.
[768.00 --> 773.00]  Before a word is on my tongue, you, Lord, know it completely.
[773.00 --> 776.00]  You hem me in, behind and before.
[776.00 --> 778.00]  You lay your hand upon me.
[778.00 --> 783.00]  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.
[783.00 --> 790.00]  O God, as we come into your presence, we thank you that you have laid your hand upon us.
[790.00 --> 792.00]  To comfort us.
[792.00 --> 793.00]  To strengthen us.
[793.00 --> 795.00]  And to guide us in this hour.
[795.00 --> 800.00]  And as we gather among family and friends, to mark the passing.
[800.00 --> 803.00]  And to give thanks for the life of Elie Bixma.
[803.00 --> 806.00]  Bless us with your kind, gracious presence.
[806.00 --> 812.00]  Be present here as we tell the story of her life and her impact on our lives.
[812.00 --> 815.00]  Help us in this service to express our feelings.
[815.00 --> 818.00]  And be near as we cry and as we laugh.
[818.00 --> 822.00]  Help us to rejoice in your promises and your gifts.
[822.00 --> 828.00]  May this also be a time to embrace and to connect with each other so that together we can be strong.
[828.00 --> 833.00]  Comfort us through words that speak of eternity.
[833.00 --> 836.00]  Great and faithful God, we praise your name.
[836.00 --> 837.00]  Amen.
[839.00 --> 841.00]  Please stand if you're able.
[844.00 --> 847.00]  We are in the presence of God and he gives us his greeting.
[847.00 --> 856.00]  Grace, mercy, peace to you from God our Father, from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[856.00 --> 858.00]  Amen.
[858.00 --> 864.00]  All the songs that we are going to sing today were chosen by Elie.
[864.00 --> 865.00]  She wrote them all down.
[865.00 --> 868.00]  There were too many we picked.
[868.00 --> 872.00]  But these are the songs that shaped her.
[872.00 --> 874.00]  That were dear to her.
[874.00 --> 876.00]  That expressed her heart.
[876.00 --> 880.00]  And so when we sing these songs we feel a connection to her.
[880.00 --> 884.00]  And a connection to a God who loves us and leads us.
[884.00 --> 887.00]  And takes us by the hand.
[887.00 --> 892.00]  So let's sing our two opening songs, Precious Lord and Lead Me Guide Me.
[892.00 --> 897.00]  by the著or,
[897.00 --> 899.00]  so let's sing,
[899.00 --> 900.00]  in the song.
[900.00 --> 904.00]  David Hamanнов andacey Pug artificial känns a person's name,
[904.00 --> 906.00]  folk of the Durchm's playing.
[906.00 --> 907.00]  Amen.
[936.00 --> 937.00]  Amen.
[966.00 --> 967.00]  Amen.
[996.00 --> 998.00]  Amen.
[1026.00 --> 1027.00]  Amen.
[1056.00 --> 1058.00]  Amen.
[1086.00 --> 1087.00]  Amen.
[1116.00 --> 1117.00]  Amen.
[1146.00 --> 1173.18]  Please be seated.
[1176.00 --> 1183.00]  I'd like to invite the family up to speak their words of remembrance.
[1206.00 --> 1220.76]  Thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the life of our mom, Ellie Beaksma.
[1220.76 --> 1223.32]  It was a life well lived.
[1223.32 --> 1226.28]  We were blessed with a great mom.
[1226.28 --> 1237.32]  She modeled grace, kindness, integrity, hard work, hospitality, creativity, and fun.
[1237.32 --> 1243.84]  She was supportive and she gave us her unconditional love.
[1243.84 --> 1248.62]  Mom and Dad brought us up in a Christian home and our family's faith in God and love for
[1248.62 --> 1252.18]  his church was always front and center.
[1252.18 --> 1258.48]  At home we prayed before and after every meal, read the Bible after dinner, and said prayers
[1258.48 --> 1260.70]  before bed.
[1260.70 --> 1267.00]  Every Sunday we went to church, twice, as well as on all Christian holidays.
[1267.00 --> 1271.14]  Basically if there was a church service, our family was there.
[1271.14 --> 1275.62]  Mom and Dad fully immersed us in the Christian community and brought us up in the way of the
[1275.62 --> 1280.54]  Lord and we had a wonderful childhood.
[1280.54 --> 1286.60]  Mom was active in the church, leading Calvinettes, singing in the choir, and later helping with
[1286.60 --> 1288.58]  friendship group.
[1288.58 --> 1293.14]  She also blessed so many with her gifts of baking and cooking.
[1293.14 --> 1298.26]  She was always ready to provide a pot of soup wherever needed.
[1298.26 --> 1304.14]  Mom had the gift of hospitality, which was obvious to anyone who came over to our house.
[1304.14 --> 1306.68]  Our friends loved to come over for a meal.
[1306.68 --> 1309.36]  Mom was always open to extra guests.
[1309.36 --> 1312.56]  Somehow there was always enough food.
[1312.56 --> 1318.40]  Her Sunday motto then, just as it was in her mid-80s just before she moved to a care home,
[1318.40 --> 1322.84]  was the door is open and the soup is clad.
[1322.84 --> 1325.74]  Mom and Dad entertained a lot when we were young.
[1325.74 --> 1331.28]  They loved to invite people from church over for lunch after Sunday morning services.
[1331.28 --> 1338.74]  Mom served coffee and a wide assortment of homemade baking before serving a lunch of soup and buns.
[1338.74 --> 1346.12]  After lunch, Dad would offer up a little something something, which was his code for a glass of wine.
[1346.12 --> 1351.56]  They made a great team and people loved coming over to our house.
[1351.56 --> 1354.76]  Mom and Dad also had friends over on Friday nights.
[1354.76 --> 1366.94]  And I remember going to sleep listening to the sounds of James Last and oom-pah-pah music and lots of laughter as they played cards with their friends.
[1366.94 --> 1371.44]  Mom was also a gifted seamstress and she sewed most of our clothes.
[1371.44 --> 1378.44]  I remember going with her to the store, seeing a dress that I liked, and then she pulled a paper and a pencil out of her purse,
[1378.44 --> 1384.62]  did a quick sketch, and a few weeks later, she made a great replica of what we saw in the store.
[1384.62 --> 1389.62]  Growing up, Mom was usually sitting behind her sewing machine every evening.
[1389.62 --> 1397.46]  She made the bridesmaid dresses for our wedding and she made Kristen's grad dress, plus so many other clothes.
[1397.46 --> 1403.34]  Mom had a great voice and she sang alto in the choir for many years.
[1403.34 --> 1411.90]  I remember loving to sit beside her and hear her singing harmony each Sunday as our family worshiped together at church.
[1411.90 --> 1420.14]  When Dad passed away in 1992, Mom was 58 and so young to lose her partner.
[1420.14 --> 1426.90]  But she was strong and committed to continuing on through her grief, even without her Albert.
[1426.90 --> 1440.34]  She built a new house, she maintained a beautiful garden, she traveled to Europe, she camped, she cruised, and she focused on her growing family, as new grandchildren were added to her clan.
[1440.34 --> 1448.46]  She took us all to Disneyland and she loved to watch her kids and grandkids enjoy themselves.
[1448.46 --> 1455.62]  Mom's home was the hub for our families, a place where we could all be together after church on Sundays.
[1455.62 --> 1465.84]  On special occasions, she served extravagant gram feasts, as her grandchildren love to call Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas dinners.
[1465.84 --> 1476.78]  She prepared a wide variety of food and served a sit-down dinner on church tables placed end-to-end through the dining room and the living room.
[1476.78 --> 1485.26]  After every meal, Mom always closed with a today devotional and a prayer, always giving thanks to God.
[1485.26 --> 1491.16]  Mom continued to be positive and kind after she fell and became less mobile.
[1491.16 --> 1496.30]  The nurses at White Rock Seniors Village and later at Elam all loved her.
[1496.30 --> 1502.84]  They all commented that she was so easy to care for and that she was always thankful.
[1502.84 --> 1509.78]  Ten days ago, Mom slipped peacefully into glory, surrounded by her family.
[1509.78 --> 1513.32]  She was a great mom and grand.
[1513.32 --> 1515.92]  I'm so grateful to be her daughter.
[1515.92 --> 1517.92]  I love you, Mom.
[1517.92 --> 1528.06]  You're going to hear a lot of the same stories.
[1528.06 --> 1533.64]  We all had the same mom.
[1533.64 --> 1541.38]  Mom and I worked together in our family flooring store for years before and after Dad passed.
[1541.38 --> 1544.98]  She loved numbers and Dad called her the watchdog.
[1544.98 --> 1549.96]  She always had papers all over her desk, checking numbers and calculations and making sure everything
[1549.96 --> 1551.44]  was right.
[1551.44 --> 1556.72]  She loved business and being a woman in business at that time when we were in such a male-dominated
[1556.72 --> 1558.02]  industry.
[1558.02 --> 1562.54]  She could talk the talk and was well-liked and respected.
[1562.54 --> 1568.06]  She was very creative and loved doing crafts with cabinets at church, singing in the choir.
[1568.06 --> 1572.94]  She could sing alto to anything and was an awesome seamstress.
[1572.94 --> 1578.78]  When we were little, she sewed all of our clothes and for any wedding or event, we had matching
[1578.78 --> 1579.78]  outfits.
[1579.78 --> 1585.84]  I remember for grad, same as mayor, we went to Yofi Creations, the fancy dress store in
[1585.84 --> 1590.34]  Richmond and she says, pick a dress and try it on.
[1590.34 --> 1593.14]  So we went, pick a dress, try it on.
[1593.14 --> 1597.66]  She'd come to the change room, pull out her paper and her pencil, make a sketch of the dress
[1597.66 --> 1598.66]  to the last detail.
[1598.66 --> 1604.16]  Then off to the fabric store, we'd pick our fabric and she would make the dress down to
[1604.16 --> 1607.86]  the last detail and it was always perfect.
[1607.86 --> 1614.54]  Mom loved fashion and she would make amazing outfits for herself and for us.
[1614.54 --> 1620.46]  Mom was a great cook and loved entertaining and feeding people and she was good at it.
[1620.46 --> 1629.38]  When Dad, when Dad was alive, they would have parties and there was tons of baking or hors d'oeuvres
[1629.38 --> 1631.54]  and often a buffet at midnight.
[1631.54 --> 1636.06]  And she always had baking and snacks and a meal for anyone and everyone.
[1636.06 --> 1639.90]  The door is open, the soup is clad.
[1639.90 --> 1643.46]  Mom worked her whole life and she loved it.
[1643.46 --> 1645.18]  It's who she was.
[1645.18 --> 1650.28]  She said the Lord made her bossy and stubborn and she owned it.
[1650.28 --> 1656.06]  When she went into care, she would always say, this isn't me and I'm bored as a rock.
[1656.06 --> 1661.48]  And before, she would always be busy all the time at home in the garden or baking and cooking
[1661.48 --> 1667.36]  or sewing and she was pretty much like that right until the time she went into care.
[1667.36 --> 1670.46]  She always said, I can do it myself and she did.
[1670.46 --> 1674.32]  I remember we would come over in the winter and her Christmas lights were up and she did
[1674.32 --> 1676.78]  it herself, I think into her 70s or 80s before.
[1676.78 --> 1680.22]  It's like, okay, we're taking your ladders away, like you need to stop.
[1680.22 --> 1690.74]  Mom's greatest love was her family.
[1690.74 --> 1696.10]  She took us on trips, cooked big dinners for all of us, often over 30 people, and made sure
[1696.10 --> 1698.12]  everyone had their favorites.
[1698.12 --> 1704.62]  She loved the noise and the craziness and we can be real noisy and crazy as a family.
[1704.62 --> 1707.02]  She would always say, the crazier the better.
[1707.02 --> 1710.32]  One starts, the rest join in.
[1710.32 --> 1714.94]  She would always read the Bible and today and pray before our dinners and she would say,
[1714.94 --> 1716.88]  thank you, thank you, Lord.
[1716.88 --> 1719.14]  Everyone is healthy and happy.
[1719.14 --> 1723.42]  My kids loved Graham and all the fun they had at her house.
[1723.42 --> 1728.74]  They would hang out with the cousins, play Nintendo or air hockey or foosball that she
[1728.74 --> 1732.28]  had bought for all of them to use in the room upstairs.
[1732.28 --> 1737.74]  Her home was our family hub and she made sure there was something for everyone and always,
[1737.74 --> 1739.70]  always fun.
[1739.70 --> 1742.04]  She loved us so much and we loved her.
[1742.04 --> 1746.20]  She was the best.
[1746.20 --> 1751.70]  I'm so thankful to my mom for showing me by example.
[1751.70 --> 1752.70]  For teaching me how to bake.
[1752.70 --> 1753.70]  I loved baking.
[1753.70 --> 1754.70]  I loved baking.
[1754.70 --> 1758.50]  For saying, don't go upstairs with empty hands.
[1758.50 --> 1760.88]  She taught me multitasking.
[1760.88 --> 1766.26]  For sewing all of our clothes to save money and make sure we were always well dressed.
[1766.26 --> 1770.20]  She taught me how to make it work even when the resources weren't there.
[1770.20 --> 1774.72]  For balancing work and home at once and showing me it could be done.
[1774.72 --> 1778.12]  For loving to entertain, have an open door.
[1778.12 --> 1781.80]  Family and friends are everything to me.
[1781.80 --> 1788.68]  For showing strength and resilience through all of the challenges in her life.
[1788.68 --> 1792.46]  She showed me how to be strong and persevere.
[1792.46 --> 1794.26]  I'm thankful for mom.
[1794.26 --> 1800.50]  She's finally at rest because she was really tired and she wanted to go home to the Lord.
[1800.50 --> 1826.18]  I'm so thankful she was my mom and I love her very much.
[1826.18 --> 1829.84]  Hi my name is Connie and I'm mom's third daughter.
[1829.84 --> 1832.34]  Our mom was a very special lady.
[1832.34 --> 1835.28]  She was a background kind of a person.
[1835.28 --> 1840.68]  She never really got mad at us and was always busy serving others.
[1840.68 --> 1845.68]  One of my really good childhood memories was Saturday mornings when mom would bake bread.
[1845.68 --> 1849.54]  Or when she would do spring cleaning and we would come home from school hoping it was
[1849.54 --> 1851.50]  our room.
[1851.50 --> 1855.34]  Everything that could be washed or wiped down was and anything that was too big for the
[1855.34 --> 1858.60]  washing machine was airing out outside.
[1858.60 --> 1861.42]  She was a very industrious lady.
[1861.42 --> 1866.00]  She would do tons of canning from our garden and when we went to Okanagan Falls we'd come
[1866.00 --> 1870.34]  home with the back of the van full of fruit for canning.
[1870.34 --> 1873.98]  She sewed a lot of our clothes and a lot of her own clothes too.
[1873.98 --> 1874.98]  No pattern.
[1874.98 --> 1877.94]  She would see an outfit and draw it out and make it.
[1877.94 --> 1883.44]  The material store in Vancouver was a favorite place for her to go.
[1883.44 --> 1888.14]  One of her favorite sayings was, don't ask me to speak in front of others but if you want
[1888.14 --> 1891.32]  a pot of soup I will bring that.
[1891.32 --> 1896.44]  And at her house the soup was always Klar.
[1896.44 --> 1900.26]  And also her delicious pink squares.
[1900.26 --> 1905.00]  I remember coming downstairs on Sunday morning and mom would be listening to Joel Naderhood
[1905.00 --> 1910.06]  in the Back to God Hour while she made the soup stock for after church.
[1910.06 --> 1914.26]  There was always a lot of food and she was very good at making it.
[1914.26 --> 1919.72]  We always joked that if there was ever a famine we could all go to mom's because she had enough
[1919.72 --> 1924.26]  food for all of us for a long time.
[1924.26 --> 1931.24]  In later years mom would come camping with my family to Linden and Vancouver Island in Oregon.
[1931.24 --> 1938.26]  She would bring enough snacks for her and my whole family and would be making meatballs, potatoes,
[1938.26 --> 1942.80]  and beans on her camp stove in the heat.
[1942.80 --> 1947.60]  Mom would drive to visit us for supper at our home in Surrey about once a week.
[1947.60 --> 1952.70]  We never knew she was coming but she always brought a little bag of chips for everyone
[1952.70 --> 1956.50]  and she brought extra just in case there was someone over.
[1956.50 --> 1960.44]  We knew she was there because the front door would open and she'd walk through the door
[1960.44 --> 1965.76]  and say, the chip lady's here.
[1965.76 --> 1972.20]  Mom loved her family so much she made her home a hub for us all and our kids looked forward
[1972.20 --> 1978.70]  to going there to visit and to play video games with her cousins upstairs at full volume.
[1978.70 --> 1980.08]  But mom didn't care.
[1980.08 --> 1982.48]  She loved the noise.
[1982.48 --> 1986.98]  And even towards the end of her life when she was in the care home she still had a sense
[1986.98 --> 1989.10]  of humor.
[1989.10 --> 1995.26]  We were there about a month ago and she was served, no I'm just ad-libbing because I have
[1995.26 --> 1996.58]  to tell the story.
[1996.58 --> 2001.44]  And she was, her meal came in, all four of us were there.
[2001.44 --> 2004.70]  She got some cranberry juice and Yvonne said, oh mom is that wine?
[2004.70 --> 2009.66]  And she goes, shh, don't tell them.
[2009.66 --> 2016.70]  Or even last week, Mare and I were there with Brian and Jordan and we were just about to leave
[2016.70 --> 2024.54]  and she says to Brian and Jordan, get out of here.
[2024.54 --> 2030.20]  It was hard to see her slowly decline until she was just in bed all the time.
[2030.20 --> 2034.40]  It was very hard for her, such a productive lady.
[2034.40 --> 2039.72]  She just wanted to go home to heaven and be with dad.
[2039.72 --> 2040.72]  We'll miss her a lot.
[2040.72 --> 2045.72]  I love you mom.
[2045.72 --> 2052.20]  Okay, basically what they said is what I've written down here.
[2052.20 --> 2056.94]  So, I'm just going to read it as I have it here.
[2056.94 --> 2058.44]  Can you imagine?
[2058.44 --> 2060.72]  Three girls and then the boy came.
[2060.72 --> 2066.96]  I know mom was super proud of all of us, but she had a story she told about how after having
[2066.96 --> 2070.52]  three lovely daughters, she finally had the boy.
[2070.52 --> 2074.72]  Over the last few years, she would cut in and tell this story during conversations that
[2074.72 --> 2078.50]  happened to be in a totally different topic to the nurses or the caregivers or whoever
[2078.50 --> 2080.32]  happened to be in the room.
[2080.32 --> 2086.32]  It was nice to hear, but I know she loved us all equally.
[2086.32 --> 2093.60]  Mom always took care of us.
[2093.60 --> 2097.16]  From making our clothes when we were little, actually I think I had a purple suit at one
[2097.16 --> 2103.72]  point, always welcoming our friends to our home and the spring cleaning every year.
[2103.72 --> 2106.50]  We were just talking about spring cleaning the other day and I don't think I ever, any of
[2106.50 --> 2110.90]  us will ever forget coming home from school, going to our rooms to have the windows open,
[2110.90 --> 2115.64]  our cozy nests being made with crisp sheets off the clothesline, and the fresh smell of
[2115.64 --> 2117.50]  Mr. Clean to fill in the room.
[2117.50 --> 2118.50]  It was pretty awesome.
[2118.50 --> 2124.50]  When I was little, my friend Pete and I were biking on a cold winter Sunday afternoon.
[2124.50 --> 2127.84]  We were over by a little park near the hospital that had a pond.
[2127.84 --> 2130.22]  The ice was frozen, so we thought.
[2130.22 --> 2134.26]  And soon enough me and my bike went right through into the ice, into the pond.
[2134.26 --> 2137.50]  After rescuing the bike, Pete and I went our separate ways.
[2137.50 --> 2138.50]  I went home.
[2138.50 --> 2142.62]  Instead of coming home to a frustrated parent, Mom sent me straight upstairs for a shower.
[2142.62 --> 2146.62]  And afterwards it came down to a nice warm bowl of soup, a bun, and an extra large glass
[2146.62 --> 2147.62]  of chocolate milk.
[2147.62 --> 2151.16]  She always took care of us.
[2151.16 --> 2155.64]  When my dad passed, Mom's care and love for her family was very, very important to her.
[2155.64 --> 2160.26]  Her generosity and willingness to do or try new things to spend time with the family was
[2160.26 --> 2162.28]  always on the table.
[2162.28 --> 2167.00]  On many occasions we have gone camping with our entire family, and being Beeksmus, it does
[2167.00 --> 2168.54]  get crazy and loud at times.
[2168.54 --> 2171.60]  Okay, let's be serious all the time.
[2171.60 --> 2174.12]  And Mom did love it.
[2174.12 --> 2176.04]  We also have been trips to Disneyland with all of us.
[2176.04 --> 2178.82]  When we couldn't go all together, Mom would take two families on one trip, and then a few
[2178.82 --> 2181.80]  months later, go back with the other two.
[2181.80 --> 2184.58]  Like I said, Mom was always willing to do something new.
[2184.58 --> 2189.84]  And just to prove it, when we went in 2019 with Nortz, keep in mind that Mom was 85 at
[2189.84 --> 2192.78]  this time, we asked her if she wanted to go on the Cars ride.
[2192.78 --> 2197.06]  If you're not familiar with this ride, you're riding on what's basically a full-size convertible
[2197.06 --> 2201.10]  that's stuck to a track that goes through mountains and around corners straightaways at
[2201.10 --> 2202.10]  40 miles an hour.
[2202.10 --> 2203.10]  It's an excellent ride.
[2203.10 --> 2208.80]  Anyway, when we're done, I turn back to look at Mom's.
[2208.80 --> 2210.78]  I ask her what she thought.
[2210.78 --> 2212.78]  Her hair was all over the place.
[2212.78 --> 2216.20]  She looked, I did not like that at all.
[2216.20 --> 2220.80]  She still smiled.
[2220.80 --> 2223.78]  Mom's true language of love was cooking and taking care of people.
[2223.78 --> 2225.78]  She was kind and generous host.
[2225.78 --> 2228.78]  The door was opened and the soup is clear.
[2228.78 --> 2232.52]  Sunday after church was filled with, starting with cake, of course.
[2232.52 --> 2234.78]  Steph never understood why you start with cake.
[2234.78 --> 2240.76]  Amazing coffee, tons of baking, snacks, nachos, and obviously soup and buns.
[2240.76 --> 2244.60]  Not only was it a Sunday special, but also the times of the year when we get together
[2244.60 --> 2247.76]  for the big feasts, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
[2247.76 --> 2252.74]  I remember on one occasion many years ago, at one of these dinners, I suggested to Mom,
[2252.74 --> 2255.74]  you know, it would be really nice to have Cornish game hens.
[2255.74 --> 2259.74]  I'm not sure I've ever had one before then, but they sounded really good.
[2259.74 --> 2264.16]  Well, Mom being a mom, and maybe me asking, it's the boy, she went out and prepared two
[2264.16 --> 2265.74]  dozen birds for the feast.
[2265.74 --> 2268.08]  It was delicious.
[2268.08 --> 2271.28]  For many years, Mom insisted on doing all the cooking, and it wasn't until later that
[2271.28 --> 2274.48]  we were allowed to bring something to contribute to the feast.
[2274.48 --> 2279.40]  She would love having a kitchen full of helpers, which was all major chaos, to help getting
[2279.40 --> 2281.12]  the food on the table.
[2281.12 --> 2284.58]  It was amazing, and it always seemed to be hot.
[2284.58 --> 2288.12]  For many years, she would also host a New Year's Day open house so that both family and
[2288.12 --> 2290.96]  friends could gather and start the New Year off together.
[2290.96 --> 2294.88]  I think on more than one occasion, she would be spending New Year's Day with the five couples,
[2294.88 --> 2298.98]  and then have to come home around one o'clock, hit the kitchen, get the olibold and ready,
[2298.98 --> 2300.44]  and everything ready for the next day.
[2300.44 --> 2301.92]  She was always the host.
[2301.92 --> 2304.44]  It wasn't taking care of family.
[2304.44 --> 2308.72]  She also helped out of church with fellowship friends, baking or cooking, or going to the
[2308.72 --> 2313.48]  grandkids' school and being the grandparent on grandparents' day, not only to her grandkids,
[2313.48 --> 2324.80]  which she adored, but also to those kids that didn't have a grandparent there that day.
[2324.80 --> 2332.40]  Mom was God-fearing, loving, self-sacrificing, generous, gracious, amazing leader of our home.
[2336.40 --> 2338.90]  When they talk about someone being the glue to the family, Mom was it.
[2338.90 --> 2346.22]  We were always welcomed home with open arms, and she always had a way to show us what's important.
[2347.06 --> 2350.00]  That was her turn to be taken care of in God's hand in the presence.
[2351.46 --> 2352.88]  Dad's been gone 33 years.
[2353.10 --> 2355.28]  I'm sure they're holding hands and dancing together.
[2356.06 --> 2356.68]  I love you, Mom.
[2356.68 --> 2372.54]  I'm sure they're holding hands and dancing together.
[2372.54 --> 2374.62]  He can bring you someukinis.
[2374.62 --> 2378.84]  I'm sure they're playing with the book in the comments because this , we're all right now.
[2378.84 --> 2379.88]  OK.
[2379.88 --> 2383.42]  Yuk Lake will anyone look forwardAll of our late 12 days before the classroom.
[2383.42 --> 2404.92]  We've heard the stories.
[2405.70 --> 2408.78]  It's amazing how you all picked up on the same things.
[2408.98 --> 2412.80]  The dresses, the soup is always clear.
[2413.42 --> 2418.48]  Who's that?
[2418.56 --> 2419.18]  That's not me.
[2423.44 --> 2427.14]  When God gives us a gift, what is our response?
[2427.62 --> 2429.06]  Our response is thanks.
[2430.16 --> 2436.64]  And so when we hear about this gift that God has given us in the person of Elie Bixma,
[2437.20 --> 2439.56]  what else can we do but say thanks?
[2439.98 --> 2441.62]  So please join with me in prayer.
[2444.00 --> 2452.22]  Dear God, giver and sustainer of life, before whom the generations rise and pass away,
[2453.10 --> 2459.76]  from age to age your people have sought you and found that of your faithfulness there is no end.
[2459.76 --> 2462.58]  And we thank you for Elie.
[2463.66 --> 2469.08]  We thank you that you have given her to this family.
[2469.08 --> 2477.44]  We thank you that Elie could live and die in the comfort of belonging to her faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2478.44 --> 2482.44]  Lord, we've heard the story of her life, and we give you thanks.
[2482.44 --> 2485.82]  She walked this earth for over 90 years.
[2485.82 --> 2492.36]  Years marked by great world events, the Depression, the Second World War.
[2492.36 --> 2501.22]  Years marked by the challenges of immigration and the joys of a growing family and rewarding work and retirement,
[2501.22 --> 2506.38]  but also the trials of the loss of her husband and declining health.
[2506.38 --> 2513.94]  Lord, we thank you for all in her that was good and kind and faithful.
[2514.90 --> 2520.38]  Lord, for all the memories we've shared today, for all the ones we'll share in different settings,
[2520.38 --> 2526.06]  for all our private and cherished memories, we thank you and we praise you.
[2527.26 --> 2533.30]  Lord, we remember your mercies to Elie, for like us all, she needed your forgiveness and grace.
[2533.86 --> 2537.72]  And we thank you for Jesus, who paid the price of her sins too.
[2539.32 --> 2543.86]  Oh, Lord, support us all the day of this troubled life, until the shadows lengthen,
[2544.30 --> 2546.96]  and the evening comes and the busy world is hushed,
[2546.96 --> 2550.40]  and the fever of life is over, and our work is done.
[2551.20 --> 2555.56]  And then, in your mercy, grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest,
[2556.24 --> 2557.82]  and a peace at last.
[2558.26 --> 2559.92]  In Jesus. Amen.
[2566.50 --> 2567.88]  There's a slideshow.
[2576.96 --> 2587.90]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2587.90 --> 2592.92]  Worship His holy name.
[2594.60 --> 2601.30]  Sing like never before, oh my soul,
[2602.06 --> 2605.88]  I worship Your holy name.
[2605.88 --> 2618.38]  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
[2618.38 --> 2623.98]  It's time to sing your song again.
[2623.98 --> 2631.70]  Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
[2631.70 --> 2640.02]  Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[2644.02 --> 2650.94]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2650.94 --> 2655.94]  Worship His holy name.
[2655.94 --> 2664.26]  Sing like never before, oh my soul,
[2664.26 --> 2669.18]  Worship Your holy name.
[2669.18 --> 2680.90]  You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger.
[2680.90 --> 2687.04]  Your name is great, and your heart is kind.
[2687.04 --> 2694.04]  For all your goodness, I will keep on singing.
[2694.04 --> 2702.04]  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[2702.04 --> 2707.04]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2707.04 --> 2713.04]  Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2713.04 --> 2718.04]  Worship His holy name.
[2720.04 --> 2725.04]  Sing like never before, oh my soul,
[2725.04 --> 2727.04]  Oh my soul, oh my soul,
[2727.04 --> 2732.04]  I worship Your holy name.
[2732.04 --> 2735.04]  Bless you, Lord.
[2735.04 --> 2759.64]  Bless you, Lord.
[2759.64 --> 2766.98]  And on that day when my strength is failed
[2766.98 --> 2773.16]  The end draws near and my time has come
[2773.16 --> 2780.34]  Still my soul would sing your praise unending
[2780.34 --> 2788.40]  Ten thousand years and then forevermore
[2788.40 --> 2799.76]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
[2799.76 --> 2804.74]  Worship His holy name
[2804.74 --> 2813.18]  Sing like never before, O my soul
[2813.18 --> 2818.54]  Worship His holy name
[2818.54 --> 2826.22]  Come bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
[2826.22 --> 2831.58]  Worship His holy name
[2831.58 --> 2839.58]  Sing like never before, O my soul
[2839.58 --> 2844.06]  Worship Your holy name
[2844.06 --> 2851.58]  Yes, I will worship Your holy name
[2851.58 --> 2856.94]  Lord, I worship Your holy name
[2856.94 --> 2862.30]  Sing like never before, O my soul
[2862.30 --> 2873.66]  Sing like never before, O my soul
[2873.66 --> 2877.02]  O my soul, O my soul
[2877.02 --> 2881.02]  Worship Your holy name
[2881.02 --> 2883.02]  Jesus, I will
[2883.02 --> 2887.02]  Worship Your holy name
[2887.02 --> 2892.38]  Worship Your holy name
[2892.38 --> 2896.38]  Worship Your holy name
[2896.38 --> 2901.74]  Worship Your holy name
[2901.74 --> 2907.74]  Worship Your holy name
[2907.74 --> 2909.10]  Worship Your holy name
[2909.10 --> 2910.40]  Thanks all
[2910.40 --> 2911.10]  Thank you
[2911.10 --> 2913.10]  Thank you
[2913.10 --> 2932.88]  There is our Redeemer, Jesus, God's own Son.
[2932.88 --> 2943.88]  Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[2944.88 --> 2955.88]  Jesus, my Redeemer, Name above all names.
[2955.88 --> 2962.88]  Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, Holy One.
[2962.88 --> 2965.88]  O for sinners slain.
[2966.88 --> 2976.88]  Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son.
[2976.88 --> 2986.88]  And leaving Your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[2986.88 --> 2998.88]  When I stand in glory, I will see His face.
[2998.88 --> 3008.88]  And there I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
[3009.88 --> 3019.88]  Thank You, O my Father, for giving us Your Son.
[3019.88 --> 3029.88]  And leaving Your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[3031.88 --> 3041.88]  There is our Redeemer, Jesus, God's own Son.
[3041.88 --> 3053.88]  And weurder, Jesus, His Son.
[3053.88 --> 3056.88]  In Japanese, if you are His Son, we will see His Son.
[3056.88 --> 3074.56]  Father, for giving us your Son, and leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[3074.56 --> 3087.30]  And leaving your Spirit till the work on earth is done.
[3104.56 --> 3131.56]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[3131.56 --> 3146.00]  I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see.
[3146.00 --> 3161.00]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[3161.00 --> 3176.00]  How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believed.
[3176.00 --> 3184.00]  My chains are gone, I've been set free.
[3185.00 --> 3192.00]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.
[3192.00 --> 3199.00]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns.
[3199.00 --> 3207.00]  Unending love, amazing grace.
[3207.00 --> 3222.00]  Unending love, amazing grace.
[3222.00 --> 3227.00]  Your God has promised good to me.
[3227.00 --> 3234.00]  His word, my hope, secures.
[3234.00 --> 3243.04]  He will my share and caution me
[3243.04 --> 3249.60]  As long as I know life and hope is
[3249.60 --> 3256.70]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[3256.70 --> 3264.72]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[3264.72 --> 3272.70]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[3272.70 --> 3278.70]  Unending love, amazing love
[3278.70 --> 3294.70]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[3294.70 --> 3302.70]  And like a flood, His mercy reigns
[3302.70 --> 3309.70]  Unending love, amazing grace
[3309.70 --> 3322.34]  The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
[3322.34 --> 3329.56]  The sun forbear to shine
[3329.56 --> 3337.56]  But God who called me here below
[3337.56 --> 3343.56]  Will be forever mine
[3343.56 --> 3350.56]  Will be forever mine
[3350.56 --> 3360.56]  You are forever mine
[3380.56 --> 3385.54]  Dear family and friends
[3385.54 --> 3389.26]  Today we find solace and strength
[3389.26 --> 3391.56]  In the words that Ellie chose for this service
[3391.56 --> 3393.96]  Words that shaped Ellie's life
[3393.96 --> 3399.44]  Words from Revelation 2, verse 10b
[3399.44 --> 3404.08]  And there on the screen it says
[3404.08 --> 3406.84]  Be faithful, even to the point of death
[3406.84 --> 3409.48]  And I will give you life
[3409.48 --> 3411.18]  As your victor's crown
[3411.18 --> 3416.08]  Jesus gave these words to the believers
[3416.08 --> 3418.20]  In the church of Smyrna
[3418.20 --> 3420.16]  Who at the time were facing
[3420.16 --> 3422.10]  Intense persecution and hardship
[3422.10 --> 3426.86]  And Jesus called them to be steadfast
[3426.86 --> 3431.26]  To hold on to their faith
[3431.26 --> 3434.32]  Even when that means suffering
[3434.32 --> 3437.32]  Even when it meant facing death
[3437.32 --> 3439.52]  Jesus called them to persevere
[3439.52 --> 3441.36]  Keep on going
[3441.36 --> 3443.32]  So strongly
[3443.32 --> 3446.80]  Live a life so devoted to Him
[3446.80 --> 3449.06]  That even death could not break
[3449.06 --> 3449.96]  Their faithfulness
[3449.96 --> 3454.02]  And these words were also given to Ellie
[3454.02 --> 3455.72]  When she was 20
[3455.72 --> 3459.14]  When she publicly professed her faith
[3459.14 --> 3461.66]  In a worship service in her village church
[3461.66 --> 3462.28]  In Holland
[3462.28 --> 3465.30]  Calling her to a life of faithfulness
[3465.30 --> 3466.54]  To her faithful Savior
[3466.54 --> 3469.20]  Calling her to persevere
[3469.20 --> 3471.54]  To stay faithful
[3471.54 --> 3473.46]  No matter what
[3473.46 --> 3475.02]  And for Ellie
[3475.02 --> 3476.72]  This verse shaped her life
[3476.72 --> 3478.62]  It gave her a vision
[3478.62 --> 3481.34]  Of what a well-lived life looks like
[3481.34 --> 3484.12]  The well-lived life
[3484.12 --> 3486.60]  Is one that is faithful
[3486.60 --> 3488.28]  No matter what
[3488.28 --> 3490.78]  She may not have faced
[3490.78 --> 3491.72]  The same persecution
[3491.72 --> 3493.22]  As the church of Smyrna
[3493.22 --> 3495.40]  Yet she understood
[3495.40 --> 3496.74]  How to be faithful
[3496.74 --> 3497.96]  In difficult times
[3497.96 --> 3500.02]  She grew up
[3500.02 --> 3501.00]  During the depravity
[3501.00 --> 3501.98]  Of the Great Depression
[3501.98 --> 3504.10]  Followed by the betrayal
[3504.10 --> 3505.56]  Fear and oppression
[3505.56 --> 3507.26]  Of Nazi occupation
[3507.26 --> 3507.94]  Of her land
[3507.94 --> 3509.74]  She knew the hard life
[3509.74 --> 3510.90]  Of rebuilding the country
[3510.90 --> 3511.68]  After war
[3511.68 --> 3513.48]  And then those tough
[3513.48 --> 3514.38]  Immigration years
[3514.38 --> 3515.46]  Learning a new language
[3515.46 --> 3516.32]  And a new culture
[3516.32 --> 3518.74]  She knew the hardship
[3518.74 --> 3520.24]  Of being widowed too early
[3520.24 --> 3521.48]  And having to carry on
[3521.48 --> 3522.82]  Without her beloved Albert
[3522.82 --> 3525.78]  Ellie received this verse
[3525.78 --> 3527.10]  As a call on her life
[3527.10 --> 3529.80]  And she lived it
[3529.80 --> 3531.48]  She was faithful
[3531.48 --> 3534.48]  She faced these situations
[3534.48 --> 3535.72]  As a Christ follower
[3535.72 --> 3537.02]  For her
[3537.02 --> 3538.32]  Staying faithful
[3538.32 --> 3539.42]  Was the only life
[3539.42 --> 3540.06]  Worth living
[3540.06 --> 3542.38]  And that worked out
[3542.38 --> 3543.66]  Into faithfulness
[3543.66 --> 3544.90]  In her relationships
[3544.90 --> 3547.04]  She was a faithful wife
[3547.04 --> 3548.76]  Helping her husband
[3548.76 --> 3549.54]  Get his business
[3549.54 --> 3550.24]  Off the ground
[3550.24 --> 3551.10]  While making sure
[3551.10 --> 3551.66]  Her children
[3551.66 --> 3552.62]  Were well
[3552.62 --> 3553.50]  Well
[3553.50 --> 3555.08]  Well dressed
[3555.08 --> 3557.58]  And well cared for
[3557.58 --> 3560.02]  She loved her children
[3560.02 --> 3560.80]  And her grandchildren
[3560.80 --> 3561.78]  To her core
[3561.78 --> 3563.70]  And her Christmas gatherings
[3563.70 --> 3564.48]  We've heard about
[3564.48 --> 3566.08]  Legendary
[3566.08 --> 3566.88]  In the family
[3566.88 --> 3568.16]  That was the way
[3568.16 --> 3569.34]  She lived her faithfulness
[3569.34 --> 3570.46]  Faithfulness
[3570.46 --> 3571.68]  To relationships
[3571.68 --> 3573.02]  The people that matter
[3573.02 --> 3574.96]  Deeply matter to her
[3574.96 --> 3578.34]  Ellie was faithful
[3578.34 --> 3580.26]  To her commitments
[3580.26 --> 3584.94]  She was committed
[3584.94 --> 3585.72]  To nurturing
[3585.72 --> 3588.44]  And passing on her faith
[3588.44 --> 3590.46]  She was always involved
[3590.46 --> 3591.12]  In her church
[3591.12 --> 3592.66]  She was a worshiper
[3592.66 --> 3594.38]  She was a choir member
[3594.38 --> 3595.84]  She was a teacher
[3595.84 --> 3596.68]  She was a helper
[3596.68 --> 3597.96]  She was a wise mentor
[3597.96 --> 3599.96]  Church was a center
[3599.96 --> 3601.02]  Of her life
[3601.02 --> 3602.78]  It was part of
[3602.78 --> 3603.70]  Her Christian walk
[3603.70 --> 3605.54]  I loved hearing
[3605.54 --> 3606.66]  How if there was
[3606.66 --> 3607.72]  A church worship service
[3607.72 --> 3609.00]  They were there
[3609.00 --> 3610.20]  As a pastor
[3610.20 --> 3611.42]  That warms my heart
[3611.42 --> 3614.86]  It was just a part
[3614.86 --> 3615.44]  Of her life
[3615.44 --> 3616.76]  Gathering
[3616.76 --> 3618.58]  Of fellow Christians
[3618.58 --> 3620.52]  To give thanks to God
[3620.52 --> 3621.34]  For blessings
[3621.34 --> 3623.66]  Ellie's faithfulness
[3623.66 --> 3624.70]  Shaped her character
[3624.70 --> 3625.94]  She was hospitable
[3625.94 --> 3626.88]  She was caring
[3626.88 --> 3628.08]  She was kind
[3628.08 --> 3628.56]  And loving
[3628.56 --> 3630.22]  She knew herself
[3630.22 --> 3631.90]  Also to be a person
[3631.90 --> 3632.82]  Who was forgiven
[3632.82 --> 3634.60]  Solely by grace
[3634.60 --> 3636.20]  And sought to pay
[3636.20 --> 3637.14]  That grace forward
[3637.14 --> 3638.88]  To everyone
[3638.88 --> 3639.84]  She came across
[3639.84 --> 3641.44]  Now Ellie
[3641.44 --> 3642.82]  From what I hear
[3642.82 --> 3643.96]  From the kids
[3643.96 --> 3645.02]  Would not want
[3645.02 --> 3645.94]  To be celebrated
[3645.94 --> 3647.28]  For this faith
[3647.28 --> 3648.64]  She would have
[3648.64 --> 3650.00]  Deflected any attention
[3650.00 --> 3651.46]  Away from her
[3651.46 --> 3653.22]  Towards Christ
[3653.22 --> 3655.18]  After all
[3655.18 --> 3656.04]  It says in the Bible
[3656.04 --> 3657.06]  That faith is a gift
[3657.06 --> 3657.66]  From God
[3657.66 --> 3658.42]  So any faith
[3658.42 --> 3659.12]  Ellie had
[3659.12 --> 3660.14]  Was given to her
[3660.14 --> 3661.30]  By the power
[3661.30 --> 3662.32]  Of the Holy Spirit
[3662.32 --> 3664.34]  So God should get
[3664.34 --> 3664.80]  The glory
[3664.80 --> 3665.60]  For that
[3665.60 --> 3666.38]  As well
[3666.38 --> 3670.12]  Ellie knew
[3670.12 --> 3670.50]  That
[3670.50 --> 3671.90]  And
[3671.90 --> 3673.56]  She would tell you
[3673.56 --> 3674.24]  That
[3674.24 --> 3676.76]  That that was
[3676.76 --> 3677.64]  The way it was
[3677.64 --> 3678.54]  My faith
[3678.54 --> 3679.04]  Is not
[3679.04 --> 3680.06]  It's a gift
[3680.06 --> 3681.18]  It's by faith
[3681.18 --> 3681.74]  By grace
[3681.74 --> 3682.52]  You are saved
[3682.52 --> 3683.96]  By faith
[3683.96 --> 3684.58]  And that
[3684.58 --> 3685.70]  Not even of yourself
[3685.70 --> 3686.90]  It's a gift of God
[3686.90 --> 3688.72]  And yet
[3688.72 --> 3689.14]  There was
[3689.14 --> 3689.88]  Her faith
[3689.88 --> 3692.28]  And she lived it well
[3692.28 --> 3694.62]  Ellie's faith
[3694.62 --> 3695.80]  Is a wonderful legacy
[3695.80 --> 3696.84]  To leave behind
[3696.84 --> 3698.36]  Her example
[3698.36 --> 3699.32]  Of ordinary
[3699.32 --> 3700.82]  Christian faith
[3700.82 --> 3703.08]  Has shaped you
[3703.08 --> 3703.90]  Her children
[3703.90 --> 3704.78]  And her grandchildren
[3704.78 --> 3707.20]  You can draw
[3707.20 --> 3708.06]  A lot of strength
[3708.06 --> 3708.64]  And wisdom
[3708.64 --> 3709.62]  From that example
[3709.62 --> 3712.42]  Ellie received
[3712.42 --> 3713.02]  That calling
[3713.02 --> 3714.84]  And isn't it wonderful
[3714.84 --> 3715.88]  That we can celebrate
[3715.88 --> 3717.56]  That God enabled her
[3717.56 --> 3719.36]  To live that calling
[3719.36 --> 3721.04]  Be faithful
[3721.04 --> 3722.28]  And to death
[3722.28 --> 3723.12]  And I will give you
[3723.12 --> 3723.94]  The crown of life
[3723.94 --> 3725.06]  And that moves us
[3725.06 --> 3726.06]  On to the promise
[3726.06 --> 3726.96]  With this calling
[3726.96 --> 3728.72]  This calling
[3728.72 --> 3729.78]  Comes with that promise
[3729.78 --> 3731.00]  And I will give you
[3731.00 --> 3732.56]  Life as your victor's crown
[3732.56 --> 3735.10]  This is more than
[3735.10 --> 3735.84]  The promise of
[3735.84 --> 3737.14]  Continued existence
[3737.14 --> 3738.02]  After death
[3738.02 --> 3738.48]  This is
[3738.48 --> 3739.62]  This is a life
[3739.62 --> 3741.12]  That is more glorious
[3741.12 --> 3742.22]  Than you can imagine
[3742.22 --> 3744.10]  It's a promise
[3744.10 --> 3745.10]  Of triumphant
[3745.10 --> 3746.16]  Eternal life
[3746.16 --> 3747.42]  In the presence of God
[3747.42 --> 3748.56]  Free from pain
[3748.56 --> 3749.18]  And sorrow
[3749.18 --> 3749.90]  And suffering
[3749.90 --> 3751.62]  It's glorious
[3751.62 --> 3754.22]  This victor's crown
[3754.22 --> 3756.38]  That it speaks of
[3756.38 --> 3757.56]  Brings to mind
[3757.56 --> 3758.14]  The practice
[3758.14 --> 3759.10]  In ancient times
[3759.10 --> 3760.18]  Of awarding a crown
[3760.18 --> 3761.12]  Of laurel leaves
[3761.12 --> 3761.78]  To athletes
[3761.78 --> 3762.64]  Who won a race
[3762.64 --> 3763.54]  Or to soldiers
[3763.54 --> 3764.54]  Who won a battle
[3764.54 --> 3767.04]  It signified honor
[3767.04 --> 3768.30]  Achievement
[3768.30 --> 3769.42]  Recognition
[3769.42 --> 3771.64]  For those who are
[3771.64 --> 3772.54]  Faithful to Christ
[3772.54 --> 3773.56]  Even to the end
[3773.56 --> 3774.72]  The crown is not made
[3774.72 --> 3776.14]  Of perishable leaves
[3776.14 --> 3778.26]  But of eternal life
[3778.26 --> 3779.00]  Itself
[3779.00 --> 3781.56]  Ellie has received
[3781.56 --> 3782.20]  This crown
[3782.20 --> 3784.16]  It's the crown
[3784.16 --> 3785.40]  Of victory over death
[3785.40 --> 3786.94]  Through Christ
[3786.94 --> 3788.30]  Death is not the end
[3788.30 --> 3789.36]  But a gateway
[3789.36 --> 3790.40]  To eternal life
[3790.40 --> 3792.46]  For God so loved
[3792.46 --> 3792.92]  The world
[3792.92 --> 3793.48]  That whoever
[3793.48 --> 3794.40]  Believes in him
[3794.40 --> 3795.50]  Shall not perish
[3795.50 --> 3797.18]  But have everlasting life
[3797.18 --> 3798.60]  Because of Christ
[3798.60 --> 3799.60]  Ellie has now
[3799.60 --> 3800.58]  Entered that joy
[3800.58 --> 3801.36]  Of victory
[3801.36 --> 3803.88]  It's also a crown
[3803.88 --> 3804.50]  Of honor
[3804.50 --> 3806.14]  Paul says in
[3806.14 --> 3807.42]  2 Timothy 4
[3807.42 --> 3808.30]  Verse 7 and 8
[3808.30 --> 3809.48]  I have fought
[3809.48 --> 3810.22]  The good fight
[3810.22 --> 3811.34]  I have finished
[3811.34 --> 3811.92]  The race
[3811.92 --> 3812.56]  I have kept
[3812.56 --> 3813.20]  The faith
[3813.20 --> 3814.46]  Now there is
[3814.46 --> 3815.26]  In store for me
[3815.26 --> 3815.96]  The crown
[3815.96 --> 3816.66]  Of righteousness
[3816.66 --> 3818.04]  Which the Lord
[3818.04 --> 3818.90]  The righteous judge
[3818.90 --> 3819.88]  Will award to me
[3819.88 --> 3820.54]  On that day
[3820.54 --> 3821.98]  And not only to me
[3821.98 --> 3823.04]  But also to all
[3823.04 --> 3823.74]  Who have longed
[3823.74 --> 3824.46]  For his appearing
[3824.46 --> 3825.98]  Ellie has run
[3825.98 --> 3826.68]  Her race
[3826.68 --> 3828.18]  And she has fought
[3828.18 --> 3828.88]  The good fight
[3828.88 --> 3829.82]  And has kept
[3829.82 --> 3830.46]  The faith
[3830.46 --> 3831.42]  And she now
[3831.42 --> 3832.00]  Has received
[3832.00 --> 3832.54]  The honor
[3832.54 --> 3833.20]  God gives
[3833.20 --> 3833.72]  To those
[3833.72 --> 3834.50]  Who honor him
[3834.50 --> 3836.16]  It's a crown
[3836.16 --> 3837.46]  Of peace
[3837.46 --> 3838.28]  And rest
[3838.28 --> 3838.90]  As well
[3838.90 --> 3841.12]  She was ready
[3841.12 --> 3842.24]  To die
[3842.24 --> 3843.16]  She was ready
[3843.16 --> 3845.84]  And she has
[3845.84 --> 3847.80]  Now finished
[3847.80 --> 3849.14]  Her life
[3849.14 --> 3850.78]  And the struggles
[3850.78 --> 3851.80]  Of this earthly life
[3851.80 --> 3852.22]  Are over
[3852.22 --> 3853.58]  She's found
[3853.58 --> 3854.14]  The peace
[3854.14 --> 3855.04]  And the rest
[3855.04 --> 3856.02]  That she has
[3856.02 --> 3856.88]  Promised
[3856.88 --> 3857.72]  In the arms
[3857.72 --> 3858.50]  Of her creator
[3858.50 --> 3860.70]  When God
[3860.70 --> 3861.12]  Holds out
[3861.12 --> 3861.54]  A promise
[3861.54 --> 3862.10]  To us
[3862.10 --> 3864.18]  We do well
[3864.18 --> 3864.66]  To grab
[3864.66 --> 3865.44]  That promise
[3865.44 --> 3867.22]  And claim it
[3867.22 --> 3868.04]  As our own
[3868.04 --> 3869.56]  So when God
[3869.56 --> 3870.30]  Promises that
[3870.30 --> 3870.98]  There is a crown
[3870.98 --> 3871.48]  Of life
[3871.48 --> 3872.04]  For those
[3872.04 --> 3872.58]  Who remain
[3872.58 --> 3873.18]  Faithful
[3873.18 --> 3875.88]  We do well
[3875.88 --> 3876.72]  To remain
[3876.72 --> 3877.88]  Faithful
[3877.88 --> 3878.92]  To Jesus
[3878.92 --> 3880.76]  We can build
[3880.76 --> 3881.26]  Our life
[3881.26 --> 3882.70]  Around that promise
[3882.70 --> 3883.72]  Just as Ellie did
[3883.72 --> 3885.22]  And we can be sure
[3885.22 --> 3886.24]  That life will be
[3886.24 --> 3887.48]  Joyful
[3887.48 --> 3889.20]  Blessed life
[3889.20 --> 3889.80]  In the presence
[3889.80 --> 3890.36]  Of God
[3890.36 --> 3892.36]  For those
[3892.36 --> 3893.02]  Of us
[3893.02 --> 3893.56]  Who remain
[3893.56 --> 3894.22]  Ellie's life
[3894.22 --> 3894.80]  And especially
[3894.80 --> 3895.58]  This powerful
[3895.58 --> 3896.06]  Scripture
[3896.06 --> 3897.26]  Inspires us
[3897.26 --> 3898.50]  They move us
[3898.50 --> 3899.48]  To live faithfully
[3899.48 --> 3901.18]  I want to live
[3901.18 --> 3902.22]  Faithfully
[3902.22 --> 3903.28]  Unto death
[3903.28 --> 3904.10]  Because there is
[3904.10 --> 3905.02]  A crown of life
[3905.02 --> 3905.94]  Eternal life
[3905.94 --> 3906.50]  For us
[3906.50 --> 3907.28]  For me
[3907.28 --> 3909.94]  No matter
[3909.94 --> 3911.48]  How
[3912.24 --> 3912.48]  Hard
[3913.72 --> 3914.26]  It is
[3914.26 --> 3916.32]  To live
[3916.32 --> 3916.92]  Faithfully
[3916.92 --> 3917.40]  Knowing that
[3917.40 --> 3918.28]  Our faithfulness
[3918.28 --> 3918.76]  No matter
[3918.76 --> 3919.54]  How small
[3919.54 --> 3920.52]  Or how grand
[3920.52 --> 3921.66]  Is seen
[3921.66 --> 3922.26]  And cherished
[3922.26 --> 3922.94]  By God
[3922.94 --> 3924.26]  Cling
[3924.26 --> 3925.66]  To that faith
[3925.66 --> 3926.94]  Cling to that
[3926.94 --> 3927.44]  Promise
[3927.44 --> 3929.00]  That for those
[3929.00 --> 3929.58]  Who are faithful
[3929.58 --> 3930.28]  Unto death
[3930.28 --> 3930.96]  There awaits
[3930.96 --> 3931.88]  A crown of life
[3931.88 --> 3932.96]  A glorious
[3932.96 --> 3933.66]  Eternity
[3933.66 --> 3936.58]  We are saying
[3936.58 --> 3937.14]  Our final
[3937.14 --> 3937.92]  Goodbyes
[3937.92 --> 3938.70]  To Ellie
[3938.70 --> 3939.24]  Today
[3939.24 --> 3940.72]  This moment
[3940.72 --> 3941.64]  Has come
[3941.64 --> 3942.82]  And we have
[3942.82 --> 3943.64]  Gone through it
[3943.64 --> 3945.04]  It comes
[3945.04 --> 3945.22]  It comes with
[3945.22 --> 3945.64]  Sorrow
[3945.64 --> 3946.28]  It comes with
[3946.28 --> 3946.62]  Grief
[3946.62 --> 3947.66]  And it's
[3947.66 --> 3948.10]  Hard
[3948.10 --> 3948.74]  To let
[3948.74 --> 3949.12]  Her go
[3949.12 --> 3950.52]  The numbness
[3950.52 --> 3951.30]  Will wear off
[3951.30 --> 3952.20]  And it will
[3952.20 --> 3952.78]  Hit you
[3952.78 --> 3955.24]  And yet
[3955.24 --> 3956.16]  We have to
[3956.16 --> 3956.72]  Let her go
[3956.72 --> 3958.70]  And as you
[3958.70 --> 3959.20]  Feel your
[3959.20 --> 3959.56]  Grief
[3959.56 --> 3961.20]  I invite you
[3961.20 --> 3961.98]  Also to feel
[3961.98 --> 3962.72]  The profound
[3962.72 --> 3963.12]  Hope
[3963.12 --> 3964.52]  And the promise
[3964.52 --> 3965.14]  That's ours
[3965.14 --> 3965.94]  Through Christ
[3965.94 --> 3967.52]  Let's remember
[3967.52 --> 3968.46]  Her faithfulness
[3968.46 --> 3970.12]  And let us be
[3970.12 --> 3970.96]  Comforted by the
[3970.96 --> 3971.72]  Assurance that
[3971.72 --> 3972.68]  She has received
[3972.68 --> 3973.52]  The victor's crown
[3973.52 --> 3974.08]  Of life
[3974.08 --> 3975.86]  And we too
[3975.86 --> 3977.22]  Can receive that
[3977.22 --> 3978.38]  When we too
[3978.38 --> 3979.74]  Stay faithful
[3979.74 --> 3980.86]  In the way
[3980.86 --> 3981.82]  Of the many
[3981.82 --> 3982.64]  Generations that
[3982.64 --> 3983.36]  Have gone by
[3983.36 --> 3985.10]  May God's peace
[3985.10 --> 3986.12]  Which transcends
[3986.12 --> 3987.16]  All understanding
[3987.16 --> 3988.28]  Guard your hearts
[3988.28 --> 3989.08]  And your minds
[3989.08 --> 3990.46]  In Christ Jesus
[3990.46 --> 3991.52]  Amen
[3991.52 --> 3997.24]  Let's stand
[3997.24 --> 3998.02]  Stand

[3999.18 --> 4000.68]  And sing
[4000.68 --> 4002.12]  A song of response
[4002.12 --> 4005.52]  The song
[4005.52 --> 4006.28]  And can it be
[4006.28 --> 4007.18]  Ends with the action
[4007.18 --> 4008.10]  For us to take
[4008.10 --> 4009.72]  Bold I approach
[4009.72 --> 4010.70]  The eternal throne
[4010.70 --> 4012.30]  And claim the crown
[4012.30 --> 4013.36]  Through Christ
[4013.36 --> 4014.28]  My own
[4014.28 --> 4015.12]  Let's sing
[4015.12 --> 4015.26]  Psalm 17

[4317.84 --> 4322.84]  Everlasting God, in the stillness of this solemn hour,
[4322.84 --> 4325.84]  You have spoken to us of eternal things,
[4325.84 --> 4329.84]  And we have heard the promises of Scripture.
[4329.84 --> 4332.64]  Thank you that we can grab hold of the promise,
[4332.64 --> 4336.64]  That you will give your faithful ones the crown of life.
[4336.64 --> 4339.64]  Thank you for the ways that promise shaped Ellie,
[4339.64 --> 4342.64]  And helped her to live a good and faithful life.
[4342.64 --> 4344.64]  God of the generations,
[4344.64 --> 4347.64]  Our mothers and fathers have walked their pilgrimage
[4347.64 --> 4351.64]  Into the light of your guidance and grace.
[4351.64 --> 4353.64]  And now to us, their children,
[4353.64 --> 4355.64]  Continue to light our path,
[4355.64 --> 4357.64]  Guide, comfort and bless us,
[4357.64 --> 4362.44]  As we carry on without Ellie with us in this life.
[4362.44 --> 4364.44]  Lord, we commend into your care,
[4364.44 --> 4366.44]  Her children and her grandchildren,
[4366.44 --> 4368.44]  And great grandchildren,
[4368.44 --> 4369.44]  As they grieve this loss.

[4408.04 --> 4410.04]  And they will miss that in their lives.
[4410.04 --> 4413.04]  Comfort them with your word and spirit.
[4413.04 --> 4416.04]  Minister to their spirits as they mourn.
[4416.04 --> 4419.04]  Heal their broken hearts in your time.

[4422.04 --> 4425.04]  With your hope and your strength.

[4426.84 --> 4428.84]  The gateway to eternal life,
[4428.84 --> 4430.84]  So that in quiet confidence,
[4430.84 --> 4433.84]  We may continue our course on earth,
[4433.84 --> 4434.84]  Until by your call,
[4434.84 --> 4437.84]  We are united with those who go on before.

[4440.84 --> 4441.84]  Who taught us to pray,
[4441.84 --> 4443.84]  And we pray together.

[4453.84 --> 4456.64]  Give us this day our daily bread,
[4456.64 --> 4458.64]  And forgive us our debts,
[4458.64 --> 4460.64]  As we forgive our debtors.
[4460.64 --> 4463.64]  And lead us not into temptation,
[4463.64 --> 4465.64]  But deliver us from evil.
[4465.64 --> 4467.64]  For yours is the kingdom,
[4467.64 --> 4470.64]  And the power and the glory forever.
[4470.64 --> 4471.64]  Amen.

[4678.34 --> 4685.34]  The dawn shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
[4686.34 --> 4693.34]  even so, in his love with my soul.
[4693.34 --> 4702.44]  He is well, he is well with my soul.
[4702.44 --> 4706.44]  He is well, he is well with my soul.
