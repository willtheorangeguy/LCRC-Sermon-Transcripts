[0.00 --> 19.70]  piano plays softly
[23.04 --> 25.04]  piano plays softly
[25.04 --> 26.04]  Amen.
[55.04 --> 56.04]  Amen.
[85.04 --> 86.04]  Amen.
[115.04 --> 116.04]  Amen.
[145.04 --> 146.04]  Amen.
[175.04 --> 176.04]  Amen.
[205.04 --> 206.04]  Amen.
[235.04 --> 236.04]  Amen.
[265.04 --> 266.04]  Amen.
[295.04 --> 296.04]  Amen.
[296.04 --> 297.04]  Amen.
[299.04 --> 301.04]  Amen.
[311.04 --> 315.54]  Bye-bye.
[318.04 --> 323.04]  My voice is partially with me today, but I invite you to stand,
[323.04 --> 325.02]  start our service with this song,
[325.12 --> 327.88]  Come Light Our Hearts, an Advent song.
[347.40 --> 348.64]  Let's sing together.
[353.04 --> 360.88]  For you, O Lord,
[360.88 --> 364.82]  a soul in stillness way.
[365.94 --> 369.42]  Truly our hope is in you.
[370.20 --> 373.94]  Truly our hope is in you.
[376.64 --> 379.36]  O Lord of life,
[379.36 --> 381.52]  our holy hope,
[381.84 --> 383.36]  your radio sky.
[384.40 --> 385.36]  Come on,
[385.44 --> 387.20]  hold on to you
[387.20 --> 388.70]  in the night.
[389.06 --> 391.10]  Emmanuel will come
[391.10 --> 395.36]  from light of heart.
[395.36 --> 399.58]  For you, O Lord,
[399.58 --> 403.52]  our souls in stillness way.
[405.84 --> 408.84]  For you, O Lord,
[408.84 --> 412.74]  our souls in stillness way.
[412.74 --> 414.64]  To you,
[414.64 --> 416.96]  our hope is in you.
[416.96 --> 419.28]  To you,
[419.28 --> 421.96]  our hope is in you.
[423.96 --> 426.22]  O Lord of life,
[426.34 --> 427.52]  our love,
[427.58 --> 428.48]  our love,
[428.72 --> 431.00]  in you we find
[431.00 --> 433.12]  more than enough.
[433.52 --> 435.62]  We come as we are,
[435.94 --> 437.90]  O heal and restore,
[437.90 --> 441.90]  come light our hearts.
[443.90 --> 445.74]  For you, O Lord,
[445.74 --> 449.90]  our souls in stillness way.
[452.86 --> 455.88]  For you, O Lord,
[455.88 --> 460.02]  our souls in stillness way.
[460.02 --> 464.02]  Truly our hope is in you.
[465.70 --> 469.46]  Truly our hope is in you.
[474.66 --> 475.80]  You may be seated.
[483.12 --> 484.50]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[485.30 --> 486.30]  Everybody's rushing in
[486.30 --> 486.98]  at the last minute.
[486.98 --> 489.32]  Good to see you all
[489.32 --> 489.82]  this morning.
[491.12 --> 492.46]  This is the first
[492.46 --> 493.98]  of four Sundays of Advent.
[494.92 --> 495.84]  Because it's the beginning
[495.84 --> 496.64]  of the church year,
[496.82 --> 497.48]  this is the time
[497.48 --> 498.06]  in the calendar
[498.06 --> 499.46]  when we await
[499.46 --> 500.90]  for the coming of Jesus.
[501.08 --> 502.08]  But in reality,
[502.64 --> 504.70]  we know that he came
[504.70 --> 506.80]  more than 2,000 years ago.
[507.04 --> 507.90]  In reality,
[508.20 --> 509.52]  we know he'll come again.
[510.82 --> 512.78]  So, on that note,
[512.90 --> 514.18]  we sing a couple of songs
[514.18 --> 516.38]  which say we're waiting
[516.38 --> 516.96]  for Christ,
[517.30 --> 518.72]  but I know he already came
[518.72 --> 519.40]  and so do you.
[521.94 --> 523.36]  If you're visiting our church
[523.36 --> 524.22]  by live stream
[524.22 --> 524.92]  or in person,
[525.08 --> 526.72]  hello on the live stream camera.
[527.24 --> 528.08]  I'm John Smith.
[528.16 --> 529.44]  I'll lead some of the early parts
[529.44 --> 530.10]  of this service.
[530.50 --> 531.78]  For those of you here,
[532.60 --> 533.86]  please stay for coffee
[533.86 --> 535.04]  or other refreshments
[535.04 --> 535.92]  after this service
[535.92 --> 536.60]  is concluded.
[537.86 --> 539.28]  The deacons have reminded me
[539.28 --> 540.32]  that this is the week
[540.32 --> 541.54]  that they've been promising you
[541.54 --> 542.48]  for several weeks.
[542.66 --> 543.58]  This is the opportunity
[543.58 --> 545.44]  to turn in your faith promise
[545.44 --> 547.56]  giving envelopes this morning.
[548.08 --> 549.08]  And that will be collected
[549.08 --> 551.06]  as we leave the service
[551.06 --> 551.62]  this morning.
[552.06 --> 553.18]  There'll be a couple of deacons
[553.18 --> 553.90]  at the door
[553.90 --> 555.60]  to collect those things.
[557.86 --> 559.78]  Our actual offering today
[559.78 --> 561.86]  is for our local church ministries.
[562.22 --> 563.02]  Monies Received Today
[563.02 --> 564.62]  will help the different ministries
[564.62 --> 565.60]  our church serves.
[565.96 --> 566.62]  It will not go
[566.62 --> 568.08]  to one particular ministry,
[568.80 --> 570.64]  but for a variety
[570.64 --> 571.48]  of the operations
[571.48 --> 572.36]  of all the ministries
[572.36 --> 572.88]  that are needed
[572.88 --> 573.58]  throughout the year.
[574.42 --> 576.38]  This may include resources
[576.38 --> 577.20]  for our nursery,
[577.80 --> 578.56]  kids life,
[579.04 --> 579.52]  cadets,
[580.04 --> 580.36]  gems,
[580.90 --> 581.50]  cross training,
[581.82 --> 582.10]  friendship,
[582.70 --> 583.66]  our Chinese ministry,
[583.90 --> 585.20]  and others that I haven't
[585.20 --> 586.28]  even bothered to list here.
[588.04 --> 589.20]  Those are the only announcements
[589.20 --> 590.04]  I have this morning.
[590.72 --> 591.78]  The new thing about
[591.78 --> 593.44]  the first four Sundays of Advent
[593.44 --> 595.04]  are a candle lighting ceremony.
[595.56 --> 597.10]  And I'll ask the Buran family
[597.10 --> 598.14]  to come up this morning
[598.14 --> 599.30]  and assist us
[599.30 --> 601.04]  in that candle lighting process.
[601.82 --> 602.34]  Where are they?
[602.42 --> 603.06]  They're here somewhere.
[604.58 --> 605.48]  There they go.
[605.48 --> 606.48]  Thank you.
[629.30 --> 637.70]  Advent begins with hope.
[638.88 --> 640.08]  Scripture tells us
[640.08 --> 641.52]  that without faith
[641.52 --> 642.64]  it is possible
[642.64 --> 643.62]  to please God
[643.62 --> 645.26]  because anyone
[645.26 --> 646.60]  who comes to him
[646.60 --> 648.08]  must believe
[648.08 --> 649.88]  that he exists
[649.88 --> 651.84]  and that
[651.84 --> 654.58]  he rewards
[654.58 --> 655.50]  those who
[655.50 --> 656.94]  honestly seek him.
[656.94 --> 659.12]  He plays
[659.12 --> 659.98]  like hope
[659.98 --> 661.04]  in God
[661.04 --> 661.56]  and I'll
[661.56 --> 662.36]  draw fear
[662.36 --> 663.18]  to those
[663.18 --> 664.26]  who seek him.
[666.84 --> 667.70]  By faith
[667.70 --> 668.44]  Enoch
[668.44 --> 669.60]  walked closely
[669.60 --> 671.04]  with God
[671.04 --> 673.00]  trusting the one
[673.00 --> 674.86]  he could not yet see.
[675.86 --> 677.38]  Lead to the looking
[677.38 --> 677.78]  hope
[677.78 --> 678.84]  to the God
[678.84 --> 679.80]  who is faithful
[679.80 --> 680.80]  and true.
[680.80 --> 680.88]  Amen.
[680.88 --> 680.94]  Amen.
[680.94 --> 681.00]  Amen.
[686.94 --> 711.70]  We light this candle
[711.70 --> 713.62]  as sign of our sure
[713.62 --> 714.86]  and sudden hope
[714.86 --> 715.54]  in Christ
[715.54 --> 718.74]  they promised one.
[719.66 --> 721.32]  Come over Jesus
[721.32 --> 723.04]  to renew our hope.
[724.64 --> 725.04]  God,
[725.36 --> 725.98]  that we need
[725.98 --> 727.26]  to keep us
[727.26 --> 728.12]  and walk
[728.12 --> 728.82]  with the Lord
[728.82 --> 729.48]  in the name
[729.48 --> 731.38]  of the Lord
[731.38 --> 732.18]  and see
[732.18 --> 733.48]  the people of presence
[733.48 --> 735.64]  in the season of the day.
[736.24 --> 736.90]  Amen.
[736.90 --> 737.12]  Amen.
[737.12 --> 737.18]  Amen.
[744.86 --> 761.18]  Well,
[761.26 --> 762.20]  would you please stand
[762.20 --> 763.00]  for the Lord's greeting
[763.00 --> 763.52]  this morning?
[771.14 --> 772.34]  We have a text.
[772.34 --> 778.96]  Ah, yes.
[779.84 --> 780.70]  The Lord's greeting
[780.70 --> 781.86]  comes from selected verses
[781.86 --> 783.12]  in Psalm 50.
[784.56 --> 785.50]  The mighty one,
[785.66 --> 786.02]  God,
[786.14 --> 786.66]  the Lord,
[786.90 --> 787.30]  speaks
[787.30 --> 788.42]  and summons the earth
[788.42 --> 789.76]  from the rising of the sun
[789.76 --> 790.70]  to where it sets.
[791.50 --> 792.24]  From Zion,
[792.50 --> 793.22]  perfect in beauty,
[793.74 --> 795.14]  God shines forth.
[796.28 --> 797.26]  Our God comes
[797.26 --> 798.82]  and will not be silent.
[799.54 --> 800.32]  Listen, my people,
[800.40 --> 801.20]  and I will speak.
[801.20 --> 802.22]  I am God,
[802.68 --> 803.44]  your God.
[804.26 --> 805.30]  Call me on the day
[805.30 --> 805.74]  of trouble.
[806.28 --> 807.30]  I will deliver you
[807.30 --> 809.16]  and you will honor me.
[810.24 --> 811.48]  With that thunderous
[811.48 --> 812.74]  announcement from our God,
[812.86 --> 813.30]  would you turn
[813.30 --> 814.14]  and greet each other
[814.14 --> 814.76]  in the same way
[814.76 --> 815.20]  this morning?
[815.20 --> 815.26]  Amen.
[818.50 --> 819.20]  Amen.
[819.20 --> 819.26]  Amen.
[819.40 --> 819.68]  Amen.
[819.68 --> 820.34]  Amen.
[820.34 --> 820.40]  Amen.
[820.40 --> 820.46]  Amen.
[820.60 --> 820.78]  Amen.
[824.86 --> 825.42]  Amen.
[827.04 --> 827.34]  Amen.
[827.34 --> 827.44]  Amen.
[827.46 --> 827.82]  Amen.
[827.82 --> 827.98]  Amen.
[827.98 --> 828.12]  Amen.
[828.12 --> 828.80]  Amen.
[828.80 --> 828.86]  Amen.
[829.06 --> 830.04]  Amen.
[830.04 --> 830.06]  Amen.
[830.06 --> 830.54]  Amen.
[830.54 --> 830.90]  Amen.
[831.20 --> 861.18]  Thank you.
[861.20 --> 891.18]  Thank you.
[891.20 --> 899.20]  And we'll introduce it, share it with you today, and just join along with us on this Advent hymn.
[899.20 --> 912.94]  Let's sing.
[912.94 --> 922.94]  Christ whose glory fills the sky, Christ the everlasting light.
[922.94 --> 934.94]  Son of righteousness, arise, and triumph for this change of life.
[934.94 --> 942.94]  Come, how long it's made in love.
[942.94 --> 952.94]  In the fullness of your love, you see your heart of shame.
[952.94 --> 958.74]  And I will never be the same.
[958.94 --> 962.94]  So here I pray in love for you.
[962.94 --> 968.94]  You are my soul, falling through and through.
[968.94 --> 973.94]  The names bring from the time of you.
[973.94 --> 979.94]  And the names are deep, my heart of fear.
[979.94 --> 989.94]  God, you are my soul, falling through and through.
[989.94 --> 991.94]  God, you are my soul, falling through and through.
[991.94 --> 997.94]  God, you are my soul, falling through and through.
[997.94 --> 999.94]  And the names bring from the time of you.
[999.94 --> 1001.94]  And the names are deep, my heart of fear.
[1001.94 --> 1003.94]  And the names are deep, my heart of fear.
[1003.94 --> 1011.94]  God, you are My soul, falling through and through, you are my soul.
[1011.94 --> 1013.94]  Amen.
[1013.94 --> 1016.94]  And the names bring from the time of you.
[1016.94 --> 1021.94]  God, you are my soul, falling through and through.
[1021.94 --> 1025.94]  And the names are deep, my heart of fear.
[1025.94 --> 1031.94]  So here I pray in the hope of you.
[1031.94 --> 1037.82]  All my souls love me to the moon
[1037.82 --> 1042.94]  And they spring from unharmed years
[1042.94 --> 1048.94]  And there's no need, my heart will be here
[1061.94 --> 1070.64]  Speak, O Lord, as we come to you
[1070.64 --> 1078.54]  To receive the food of your holy word
[1078.54 --> 1084.78]  Keep your tree planted deep in us
[1084.78 --> 1091.48]  Shape and fashion us in your darkness
[1091.48 --> 1098.74]  That the light of Christ might be seen today
[1098.74 --> 1106.54]  In our acts of love and our deeds of faith
[1106.54 --> 1112.82]  Speak, O Lord, and fulfill the acts
[1112.82 --> 1119.68]  For your purposes, for your glory
[1119.68 --> 1133.74]  Teach us faithful obedience
[1133.74 --> 1140.94]  For it will us to will be
[1140.94 --> 1148.20]  Death's our fault and our attitude
[1148.20 --> 1155.00]  With the radiance of your glory
[1155.00 --> 1162.26]  Cause our faithful eyes, cause our eyes to see
[1162.26 --> 1170.38]  Your majestic love and our glory is thee
[1170.38 --> 1176.00]  Words of power that can never end
[1176.00 --> 1183.26]  Let the truth be ever come to thee
[1183.26 --> 1197.26]  Speak, O Lord, that we knew
[1197.26 --> 1198.26]  The truth be ever come to thee
[1198.26 --> 1199.26]  And our hearts will be
[1199.26 --> 1200.26]  The truth be ever come to thee
[1200.26 --> 1202.26]  And our hearts will be
[1202.26 --> 1204.26]  The truth be ever come to thee
[1204.26 --> 1208.26]  Let the truth be Sow' power coo-έλ
[1208.26 --> 1208.90]  be changed.
[1209.42 --> 1212.28]  Come the dawn of time.
[1212.62 --> 1215.68]  I will wolf around
[1215.68 --> 1218.74]  for eternity.
[1219.56 --> 1221.36]  And my grace
[1221.36 --> 1222.94]  will stand
[1222.94 --> 1225.84]  on Your promises.
[1226.64 --> 1228.40]  And I faith
[1228.40 --> 1229.88]  will all
[1229.88 --> 1232.02]  as you are
[1232.02 --> 1234.06]  with us.
[1234.60 --> 1237.00]  Speak of all
[1237.00 --> 1247.32]  In your church is filled, and the earth is filled with your glory.
[1250.04 --> 1251.42]  You may be seated.
[1251.42 --> 1281.40]  You may be seated.
[1281.42 --> 1311.40]  You may be seated.
[1311.42 --> 1313.42]  You may be seated.
[1313.42 --> 1315.42]  You may be seated.
[1315.42 --> 1317.42]  You may be seated.
[1317.42 --> 1322.66]  After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
[1323.50 --> 1329.22]  Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
[1329.22 --> 1332.98]  Further down in verse 21.
[1332.98 --> 1340.02]  When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[1340.02 --> 1349.78]  After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
[1350.86 --> 1354.90]  Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
[1355.58 --> 1357.50]  God walked faithfully with God.
[1357.50 --> 1359.54]  God, Enoch walked faithfully with God.
[1359.54 --> 1363.16]  Then he was no more, because God took him away.
[1363.16 --> 1379.82]  In our time of confession this morning, we have a text up here.
[1379.82 --> 1381.96]  Let's read the text.
[1382.04 --> 1384.44]  You know the single bullets and the double bullets.
[1384.44 --> 1396.28]  We need you to speak to us, O God, because we have at times, each in our own way, forgotten your law, forgotten your love for us.
[1396.28 --> 1404.04]  We are in need of your deliverance because we have too often been guilty of practices that would destroy us.
[1404.40 --> 1406.52]  We are too often in need of rescue.
[1407.52 --> 1410.98]  In this season of Advent, we say together,
[1411.86 --> 1416.04]  Come, Lord Jesus, forgive us and restore us.
[1416.64 --> 1420.42]  Come, Lord Jesus, guide us and deliver us.
[1420.94 --> 1425.36]  Come, Lord Jesus, teach us and renew us.
[1426.28 --> 1430.04]  Come, Lord Jesus, guide us and bless you.
[1430.04 --> 1432.42]  But we have an assurance of God's grace.
[1433.56 --> 1437.32]  The first assurance is from an unlikely source.
[1439.16 --> 1445.28]  Charlie Chaplin earned a living largely by saying absolutely nothing.
[1446.66 --> 1450.06]  For you younger folks, he was a star in silent films.
[1450.06 --> 1456.76]  He lived to be 88 years old and left us unspoken words of advice in the last days of his life.
[1457.56 --> 1458.32]  He said,
[1459.06 --> 1462.96]  If you see the moon, you will see the beauty of God.
[1463.42 --> 1467.10]  If you see the sun, you will see the power of God.
[1467.76 --> 1471.80]  If you see a mirror, you will see God's best creation.
[1471.80 --> 1473.64]  So believe it.
[1474.36 --> 1475.82]  We are all tourists.
[1476.56 --> 1482.40]  God is our travel agent who has already identified our routes, bookings, and destinations.
[1483.08 --> 1485.08]  Trust him and enjoy life.
[1485.08 --> 1491.58]  But the apostle Paul was a bit more pointed, bringing Christ into the picture.
[1492.72 --> 1499.30]  In 2 Corinthians 5, verses 16 and following, we have a few words.
[1499.30 --> 1505.00]  So from now on, we regard no one from a worldly point of view.
[1505.28 --> 1509.30]  Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
[1510.06 --> 1510.62]  And together.
[1511.46 --> 1517.08]  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, that person is a new creation.
[1517.86 --> 1519.22]  The old has gone.
[1519.62 --> 1520.94]  The new is here.
[1521.50 --> 1527.56]  All this is from God who reconciled us through himself in Christ Jesus.
[1529.30 --> 1534.94]  Our song of assurance is,
[1535.16 --> 1537.28]  My hope is built on nothing less.
[1542.28 --> 1543.30]  Let's stand.
[1543.30 --> 1565.88]  My hope is built on nothing less.
[1566.00 --> 1570.20]  Let Jesus come and preciousness.
[1570.20 --> 1574.64]  I dare not trust the sweetest flame,
[1574.92 --> 1579.20]  The holy need of Jesus' name.
[1580.40 --> 1584.20]  Out was the southern of the stand,
[1585.02 --> 1589.04]  No other ground is sinking sand.
[1589.38 --> 1594.84]  No other ground is sinking sand.
[1594.84 --> 1600.10]  When darkness mails His lovely face,
[1600.10 --> 1604.78]  I rest on His unchanging grace.
[1605.08 --> 1609.28]  In every high-ass storming air,
[1609.48 --> 1614.20]  My anger holds within the veil.
[1615.10 --> 1619.54]  On was the southern route I stand,
[1619.54 --> 1623.54]  On other ground is sinking sand.
[1623.54 --> 1630.34]  All other ground is sinking sand.
[1631.34 --> 1635.80]  He told His love, and His blood,
[1635.94 --> 1640.38]  So part me in love and we plan,
[1640.78 --> 1644.74]  When all around my soul gives name,
[1644.74 --> 1650.04]  He did this all my love and say,
[1650.04 --> 1655.18]  On Christ the southern rock I stand,
[1655.18 --> 1659.88]  All other ground is sinking sand.
[1659.88 --> 1665.78]  All other ground is sinking sand.
[1666.94 --> 1670.84]  In His own love with trumpet sound,
[1670.84 --> 1676.18]  All way I dare, in Him be found,
[1676.18 --> 1680.48]  First in His righteousness alone,
[1680.48 --> 1685.48]  All rest to stand before a throne.
[1685.48 --> 1691.22]  On Christ the southern rock I stand,
[1691.22 --> 1695.86]  All other ground is sinking sand.
[1695.86 --> 1702.48]  All other ground is sinking sand.
[1704.08 --> 1704.54]  Amen.
[1704.78 --> 1705.54]  You may be seated.
[1705.54 --> 1706.54]  Amen.
[1712.34 --> 1715.22]  Well, let me pray for the kids as we send them out.
[1715.22 --> 1715.90]  Let's pray together.
[1716.94 --> 1720.30]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for our children.
[1720.98 --> 1721.88]  And we thank you, Lord,
[1721.94 --> 1724.22]  That they also today have an opportunity
[1724.22 --> 1726.52]  To learn more about you
[1726.52 --> 1729.48]  In a way that they can understand.
[1730.14 --> 1731.18]  So, Lord, be with them,
[1731.34 --> 1732.98]  Be with their teachers and their helpers, Lord,
[1732.98 --> 1734.92]  As they go to continue to worship you.
[1735.14 --> 1736.18]  We pray in Christ's name.
[1736.34 --> 1736.56]  Amen.
[1737.34 --> 1737.76]  All right.
[1737.82 --> 1740.68]  So, the teachers and helpers and kids
[1740.68 --> 1742.40]  Are dismissed to go to their classes.
[1742.40 --> 1742.56]  All right.
[1762.98 --> 1768.64]  So, good morning to you all.
[1770.40 --> 1772.52]  And as John has already said,
[1772.72 --> 1774.84]  Today is the first Sunday
[1774.84 --> 1776.82]  In the church season of Advent.
[1777.88 --> 1779.18]  And so, what is Advent?
[1779.84 --> 1782.38]  Advent is the season when the church
[1782.38 --> 1784.44]  Thinks about waiting and hoping.
[1785.18 --> 1785.30]  Okay.
[1785.30 --> 1786.84]  So, when we think about waiting and hoping.
[1787.62 --> 1789.06]  You know, our society, of course,
[1789.12 --> 1791.12]  Is waiting for Christmas.
[1791.98 --> 1792.20]  Right?
[1792.20 --> 1793.00]  And that's a good thing.
[1793.62 --> 1796.90]  But Advent is actually more than just Christmas.
[1797.46 --> 1798.18]  You know, in Advent,
[1798.40 --> 1802.08]  We look back to the coming of Jesus among us.
[1802.60 --> 1802.80]  Right?
[1802.80 --> 1804.42]  We think about the long years
[1804.42 --> 1807.40]  As Israel, God's people,
[1807.54 --> 1809.60]  Waited for the coming of the Messiah.
[1811.36 --> 1814.08]  But Advent is also not only looking back,
[1814.18 --> 1815.36]  But it's looking forward.
[1815.58 --> 1816.62]  So, we too are waiting.
[1816.74 --> 1819.64]  And we are waiting for the return of Christ.
[1819.64 --> 1821.62]  We wait and we hope,
[1821.96 --> 1825.04]  Just like Israel did for the first Advent.
[1825.80 --> 1828.36]  Because this same Jesus, who came once,
[1828.78 --> 1829.64]  Is coming again.
[1830.32 --> 1832.28]  And he's coming again a second time.
[1833.86 --> 1836.12]  And so, that's what the Advent is all about.
[1836.20 --> 1838.40]  It's a season of waiting and of hoping.
[1838.40 --> 1841.16]  And we're going to enter into this season,
[1841.28 --> 1841.78]  This year,
[1842.46 --> 1844.74]  Through an Advent sermon series,
[1845.40 --> 1847.04]  In the book of Hebrews.
[1847.38 --> 1848.72]  Hebrews chapter 11.
[1849.84 --> 1850.66]  And so,
[1850.88 --> 1852.90]  This is often known as
[1852.90 --> 1855.22]  The Hall of Faith.
[1855.78 --> 1856.80]  And what it does is,
[1856.86 --> 1859.44]  It gives us a long list of men and women
[1859.44 --> 1860.58]  From the Old Testament,
[1860.58 --> 1864.18]  That are called the ancients.
[1864.74 --> 1865.82]  And they are, in a sense,
[1866.34 --> 1868.52]  Heroes of faith.
[1869.24 --> 1871.34]  You know, they were everyday men and women,
[1871.46 --> 1872.24]  Just like us.
[1872.78 --> 1875.04]  But they are commended by God
[1875.04 --> 1876.08]  For their faith,
[1876.14 --> 1877.28]  For the way that they waited.
[1878.36 --> 1881.34]  And we will choose just four from this list,
[1881.44 --> 1882.00]  This long list.
[1882.04 --> 1882.76]  So, we're going to look,
[1883.00 --> 1884.12]  Over the coming weeks,
[1884.12 --> 1885.42]  At Enoch,
[1886.00 --> 1887.10]  And at Noah,
[1887.82 --> 1888.48]  And Abraham,
[1888.82 --> 1889.36]  And Moses.
[1890.48 --> 1892.06]  And so, for each one of them,
[1892.12 --> 1892.60]  Each week,
[1892.64 --> 1893.62]  As we look at their lives,
[1893.66 --> 1894.58]  We're going to look at
[1894.58 --> 1895.92]  Their life of faith,
[1896.64 --> 1898.94]  And the shape that their faith took,
[1899.32 --> 1901.16]  In their own time and circumstances.
[1901.70 --> 1901.86]  Right?
[1901.92 --> 1904.26]  Because they all lived in different situations.
[1905.44 --> 1906.94]  And we will also look at
[1906.94 --> 1909.24]  How they are good examples for us,
[1909.50 --> 1911.24]  In our own time of waiting.
[1912.42 --> 1912.90]  And so,
[1912.90 --> 1914.28]  The one we're going to look at today,
[1914.54 --> 1917.68]  Is this mysterious Old Testament figure,
[1918.58 --> 1919.86]  Called Enoch.
[1920.32 --> 1920.64]  Enoch.
[1920.76 --> 1922.30]  So, let's open our Bibles.
[1922.42 --> 1923.02]  We're going to read,
[1923.20 --> 1924.38]  From Hebrews chapter 11.
[1929.14 --> 1930.00]  So, you're,
[1930.76 --> 1931.80]  As soon as you find it,
[1931.84 --> 1932.66]  I'll tell you the page number.
[1934.56 --> 1936.16]  It's on page 8 to 9 4.
[1936.56 --> 1937.34]  8, 9, 4.
[1937.44 --> 1939.30]  And you're welcome to follow along in your pew Bible.
[1939.50 --> 1940.90]  You're welcome to follow along on the screen.
[1940.90 --> 1943.72]  You're also welcome to close your eyes and listen,
[1943.90 --> 1944.86]  As it is read.
[1945.54 --> 1949.12]  But we will be reading verses 1 through 6 today.
[1949.12 --> 1952.28]  So, this is God's word,
[1952.36 --> 1954.50]  Beginning in Hebrews chapter 11, verse 1.
[1954.50 --> 1959.84]  Now, faith is being sure of what we hope for,
[1960.46 --> 1962.66]  And certain of what we do not see.
[1963.34 --> 1966.00]  This is what the ancients were commended for.
[1966.88 --> 1970.68]  By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God's command,
[1970.68 --> 1975.28]  So that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
[1976.32 --> 1980.70]  By faith, Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did.
[1981.30 --> 1986.04]  By faith, he was commended as a righteous man when God spoke well of his offerings.
[1986.54 --> 1990.30]  And by faith, he still speaks, even though he is dead.
[1990.30 --> 1996.14]  By faith, Enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death.
[1996.62 --> 1999.22]  He could not be found because God had taken him away.
[2000.06 --> 2004.32]  For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
[2004.88 --> 2007.46]  And without faith, it is impossible to please God,
[2007.88 --> 2011.80]  Because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists
[2011.80 --> 2016.72]  And that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
[2016.72 --> 2018.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2020.62 --> 2024.00]  Let's join our hearts in prayer as we come before God
[2024.00 --> 2026.04]  And ask for his blessing upon his word.
[2026.32 --> 2027.30]  Let's pray together.
[2028.70 --> 2032.40]  Lord God, our great creator,
[2033.28 --> 2036.52]  Lord, our heart's desire is to please you.
[2037.08 --> 2040.48]  Our heart's desire is to honor you, to glorify you.
[2041.10 --> 2044.38]  And Lord, we recognize that Enoch did that well.
[2044.38 --> 2046.94]  That he walked with you.
[2047.86 --> 2050.12]  And may we do the same.
[2051.18 --> 2053.42]  And so as we come to your word this morning,
[2053.54 --> 2056.32]  Would your Holy Spirit help us to come to you,
[2056.40 --> 2060.76]  To seek after you as you draw near to us
[2060.76 --> 2063.22]  In your love and in your faithfulness.
[2063.44 --> 2065.56]  We thank you, Lord, that you are here among us
[2065.56 --> 2066.42]  And that you speak.
[2067.06 --> 2070.34]  It's in your name we pray, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2070.82 --> 2071.08]  Amen.
[2071.08 --> 2071.16]  Amen.
[2073.00 --> 2076.20]  So as we look at the life of Enoch this morning,
[2076.42 --> 2078.64]  Way back in ancient times,
[2079.42 --> 2082.84]  First, we're not going to begin in ancient Israel.
[2083.44 --> 2085.62]  I want to take us forward in time,
[2085.78 --> 2087.16]  Come with me forward in time,
[2087.40 --> 2090.22]  To the 1700s in Scotland.
[2090.94 --> 2092.08]  Okay, we're leaving ancient Israel.
[2093.04 --> 2094.00]  1700s Scotland.
[2094.00 --> 2097.78]  So James Bruce was a nobleman.
[2098.42 --> 2101.92]  He was the great-grandson of Robert the Bruce,
[2102.02 --> 2103.28]  Who was the king of Scotland.
[2103.86 --> 2106.32]  Okay, so this grandson, great-grandson of the king,
[2107.18 --> 2108.16]  James Bruce.
[2108.74 --> 2113.10]  Now this guy was a bit of an eccentric nobleman.
[2113.60 --> 2115.04]  He was an explorer.
[2115.74 --> 2117.82]  And what he sought to explore
[2117.82 --> 2122.54]  Was to trace the source of the Nile in Egypt.
[2122.54 --> 2125.12]  So in 1769,
[2125.74 --> 2128.88]  He set out from Scotland
[2128.88 --> 2131.30]  And he went to the continent of Africa
[2131.30 --> 2133.56]  To try to trace the source of the Nile.
[2134.10 --> 2136.48]  And he wanted to find a trade route
[2136.48 --> 2138.12]  Through to the Red Sea.
[2138.52 --> 2140.56]  Because going around the tip of Africa
[2140.56 --> 2144.02]  Was a very perilous, dangerous voyage
[2144.02 --> 2144.84]  And very costly.
[2145.18 --> 2146.46]  So if they could find a trade route
[2146.46 --> 2148.44]  That would cut that path short,
[2148.84 --> 2150.16]  Then that would be a great benefit.
[2150.16 --> 2152.82]  So he went to trace the sea
[2152.82 --> 2154.40]  If they could navigate through the Nile
[2154.40 --> 2155.08]  To the Red Sea.
[2155.64 --> 2157.20]  And so he traveled to Egypt.
[2157.90 --> 2159.20]  And he traveled through Sudan.
[2159.46 --> 2161.10]  And he traveled to Ethiopia.
[2161.96 --> 2163.70]  And he claimed that he did find
[2163.70 --> 2164.62]  The source of the Nile.
[2165.56 --> 2167.12]  Unfortunately, it did not provide
[2167.12 --> 2169.52]  That shipping route that he had hoped for.
[2169.52 --> 2173.58]  But he did make a fascinating discovery.
[2174.34 --> 2178.26]  What he found were three fully intact,
[2178.48 --> 2180.80]  Complete ancient manuscripts.
[2181.74 --> 2185.06]  And the title of the manuscripts was
[2185.06 --> 2187.56]  The Book of Enoch.
[2187.56 --> 2192.58]  This was an ancient Jewish apocryphal writing
[2192.58 --> 2194.72]  That was thought to have been lost
[2194.72 --> 2195.88]  During the Middle Ages.
[2197.26 --> 2199.20]  Historians believe that the Book of Enoch
[2199.20 --> 2201.82]  Was written actually a few centuries
[2201.82 --> 2203.02]  Before Jesus.
[2203.78 --> 2206.22]  And that it would have been actually circulating
[2206.22 --> 2209.10]  During the time of Jesus' life and ministry.
[2209.24 --> 2211.56]  It was a well-known Jewish writing.
[2211.56 --> 2212.04]  Writing.
[2212.70 --> 2214.56]  But it was considered literature.
[2215.38 --> 2217.40]  Not part of the Hebrew Bible.
[2218.18 --> 2219.22]  Not part of Hebrew Scripture.
[2219.44 --> 2219.98]  Why not?
[2220.16 --> 2222.42]  Well, because it's not at all consistent
[2222.42 --> 2223.18]  With the Old Testament.
[2223.68 --> 2226.02]  It's not consistent in the theology
[2226.02 --> 2227.60]  And the history of redemption
[2227.60 --> 2228.88]  That we read in the Old Testament.
[2229.46 --> 2231.04]  And it's not consistent with the stories.
[2232.44 --> 2234.04]  And so actually what it has
[2234.04 --> 2236.98]  Is quite fantastical stories
[2236.98 --> 2238.56]  Of fallen angels and giants.
[2238.56 --> 2239.08]  Giants.
[2239.62 --> 2241.72]  And all this kind of really wild and crazy stuff.
[2243.16 --> 2245.26]  And actually so what it seems to be doing
[2245.26 --> 2248.26]  Is to try to provide a backstory.
[2249.16 --> 2249.92]  A backstory.
[2250.18 --> 2251.80]  You know, to fill in the blanks
[2251.80 --> 2254.84]  To what seems like a very just simple
[2254.84 --> 2257.58]  Life of Enoch that we find in the Old Testament.
[2258.54 --> 2259.78]  You know, it's kind of like
[2259.78 --> 2261.74]  You know, they made the first three Star Wars movies
[2261.74 --> 2262.64]  And then what do they do?
[2263.50 --> 2265.14]  They try to write the prequel
[2265.14 --> 2266.92]  And they try to fill in the backstory.
[2267.08 --> 2268.54]  Often it's not quite as good as the original.
[2269.56 --> 2271.68]  That's kind of what the book of Enoch is like.
[2272.10 --> 2273.62]  Okay, so we find in the Old Testament
[2273.62 --> 2276.24]  Enoch is this very mysterious character.
[2276.56 --> 2278.08]  We know very little about him.
[2278.64 --> 2280.48]  There's only four verses about him
[2280.48 --> 2281.86]  In the entire Old Testament.
[2282.28 --> 2283.24]  And we read them earlier.
[2283.90 --> 2284.54]  Right, so again
[2284.54 --> 2286.32]  We read in Genesis chapter 5
[2286.32 --> 2288.38]  This one verse where it says
[2288.38 --> 2290.64]  Enoch walked faithfully with God
[2290.64 --> 2292.96]  Then he was no more.
[2293.56 --> 2295.66]  Because God took him away.
[2296.66 --> 2297.98]  Right, God took him right to heaven.
[2298.66 --> 2299.94]  Without him tasting death
[2299.94 --> 2302.62]  Because he walked faithfully with God.
[2303.14 --> 2303.76]  And that's it.
[2303.86 --> 2305.24]  That's all we learn about Enoch.
[2306.78 --> 2309.40]  Then we come forward to the New Testament
[2309.40 --> 2310.60]  In Hebrews chapter 11.
[2310.60 --> 2313.76]  And it says much the same thing
[2313.76 --> 2314.74]  In verse 5.
[2315.28 --> 2315.58]  It says,
[2315.76 --> 2318.14]  By faith Enoch was taken from this life
[2318.14 --> 2320.38]  So that he did not experience death.
[2320.56 --> 2321.36]  Quoting Genesis
[2321.36 --> 2322.68]  He could not be found
[2322.68 --> 2324.14]  Because God had taken him away.
[2324.72 --> 2326.36]  For before he was taken
[2326.36 --> 2327.58]  He was commended
[2327.58 --> 2329.74]  As one who pleased God.
[2329.74 --> 2332.44]  Now notice there at the end
[2332.44 --> 2334.98]  Where Enoch is referred to
[2334.98 --> 2337.76]  As one who pleased God.
[2338.42 --> 2339.44]  And that's actually
[2339.44 --> 2340.52]  The very same meaning
[2340.52 --> 2342.00]  As in Genesis 5
[2342.00 --> 2342.72]  Where it says
[2342.72 --> 2343.80]  He walked with God.
[2343.88 --> 2344.52]  Okay, so just
[2344.52 --> 2346.34]  Very simply put
[2346.34 --> 2348.06]  Pleasing God
[2348.06 --> 2349.42]  And walking with God
[2349.42 --> 2350.76]  Mean the same thing.
[2350.76 --> 2352.60]  And so
[2352.60 --> 2353.66]  That is to say
[2353.66 --> 2356.06]  That even though we know
[2356.06 --> 2358.50]  So little about Enoch
[2358.50 --> 2359.78]  What we do know
[2359.78 --> 2362.10]  Is that he walked with God.
[2362.86 --> 2363.66]  And that
[2363.66 --> 2365.22]  This walking with God
[2365.22 --> 2367.20]  Was pleasing to God.
[2367.20 --> 2371.44]  And that's what Enoch did
[2371.44 --> 2372.86]  That was so special.
[2374.30 --> 2375.00]  And so
[2375.00 --> 2377.80]  The writer of the book of Hebrews
[2377.80 --> 2379.20]  Now I'm going to keep saying that
[2379.20 --> 2379.74]  In this series
[2379.74 --> 2381.08]  The writer of the book of Hebrews
[2381.08 --> 2381.98]  Because we don't know
[2381.98 --> 2383.00]  Who exactly wrote it
[2383.00 --> 2384.04]  Some people think it was Paul
[2384.04 --> 2385.70]  We're not exactly sure
[2385.70 --> 2386.80]  So we'll just say
[2386.80 --> 2387.64]  The writer of Hebrews
[2387.64 --> 2388.34]  The Hebrews writers
[2388.34 --> 2389.02]  Things like that.
[2390.38 --> 2391.24]  But anyway
[2391.24 --> 2393.54]  He writes about
[2393.54 --> 2394.82]  The life of Enoch
[2394.82 --> 2396.74]  And notice that
[2396.74 --> 2397.78]  As he does so
[2397.78 --> 2400.26]  He completely ignores
[2400.26 --> 2401.98]  This apocryphal book of Enoch.
[2402.28 --> 2404.22]  He ignores the backstory
[2404.22 --> 2405.34]  That in a sense
[2405.34 --> 2406.76]  Tries to embellish
[2406.76 --> 2408.24]  His life.
[2408.34 --> 2410.06]  It tries to kind of add on
[2410.06 --> 2412.66]  To that simple life of faith.
[2414.06 --> 2415.02]  And so the question is
[2415.02 --> 2416.46]  Is it enough
[2416.46 --> 2418.56]  To just walk with God
[2418.56 --> 2419.64]  To please God?
[2420.74 --> 2422.64]  And the answer of our passage is
[2422.64 --> 2423.38]  Yes.
[2424.36 --> 2425.38]  You know I think so often
[2425.38 --> 2426.46]  When we think about our lives
[2426.46 --> 2427.54]  Especially if we grew up
[2427.54 --> 2428.08]  As a Christian
[2428.08 --> 2428.94]  Sometimes we think
[2428.94 --> 2430.18]  Well I don't have a very
[2430.18 --> 2430.88]  You know
[2430.88 --> 2432.30]  Special testimony
[2432.30 --> 2433.46]  I didn't have this great
[2433.46 --> 2435.00]  Moment of coming to faith
[2435.00 --> 2436.44]  And maybe I haven't done
[2436.44 --> 2437.92]  Amazing things for God
[2437.92 --> 2439.56]  I haven't lived a radical life
[2439.56 --> 2440.80]  You know I haven't gone
[2440.80 --> 2441.74]  And lived in a cave
[2441.74 --> 2442.34]  In a monastery
[2442.34 --> 2443.84]  I haven't you know
[2443.84 --> 2444.72]  Gone overseas
[2444.72 --> 2445.62]  To be a missionary
[2445.62 --> 2447.72]  I haven't fought with lions
[2447.72 --> 2449.02]  I haven't done all these things
[2449.02 --> 2451.62]  But the story of Enoch
[2451.62 --> 2452.56]  Teaches us that
[2452.56 --> 2455.14]  A life that pleases God
[2455.14 --> 2456.30]  Is not those things
[2456.30 --> 2458.08]  It is simply a life
[2458.08 --> 2460.14]  Of walking with God
[2460.14 --> 2462.82]  And so the question
[2462.82 --> 2463.74]  That we're going to be asking
[2463.74 --> 2465.04]  Each week during Advent
[2465.04 --> 2466.88]  Is what does a life of faith
[2466.88 --> 2467.38]  Look like?
[2468.04 --> 2469.46]  And the answer that Enoch
[2469.46 --> 2470.22]  Gives us
[2470.22 --> 2472.82]  Is that a well lived life
[2472.82 --> 2474.92]  Is a life of walking with God
[2474.92 --> 2476.78]  Now
[2476.78 --> 2479.00]  Why is that so special?
[2480.72 --> 2482.16]  What's so amazing
[2482.16 --> 2483.46]  Where
[2483.46 --> 2484.62]  You know
[2484.62 --> 2486.70]  The writer of Hebrews
[2486.70 --> 2487.80]  Looks to Enoch
[2487.80 --> 2488.84]  He walked with God
[2488.84 --> 2489.78]  And holds it up
[2489.78 --> 2490.56]  As one of the great
[2490.56 --> 2491.62]  And stunning cases
[2491.62 --> 2493.24]  In all of history
[2493.24 --> 2495.16]  Of a life of faith
[2495.16 --> 2497.22]  What's so amazing
[2497.22 --> 2497.84]  About that
[2497.84 --> 2498.80]  Walking with God
[2498.80 --> 2501.24]  Well this is why
[2501.24 --> 2503.00]  If you think about
[2503.00 --> 2504.34]  If you think about
[2504.34 --> 2505.44]  Or look up
[2505.44 --> 2508.76]  Where is the first time
[2508.76 --> 2510.00]  That the word walk
[2510.00 --> 2512.28]  Is found in the Bible
[2512.28 --> 2515.50]  And if you look it up
[2515.50 --> 2516.00]  You'll find that
[2516.00 --> 2516.76]  The very first time
[2516.76 --> 2517.34]  The word walk
[2517.34 --> 2518.12]  Is used in the Bible
[2518.12 --> 2519.80]  Is in Genesis chapter 3
[2519.80 --> 2520.78]  Verse 8
[2520.78 --> 2522.72]  So here's what it says
[2522.72 --> 2523.56]  Now Adam and Eve
[2523.56 --> 2525.14]  Had just disobeyed God
[2525.14 --> 2526.78]  And this says this
[2526.78 --> 2529.22]  Then the man and his wife
[2529.22 --> 2530.50]  Heard the sound
[2530.50 --> 2531.38]  Of the Lord God
[2531.38 --> 2532.52]  As he was walking
[2532.52 --> 2533.18]  In the garden
[2533.18 --> 2534.20]  In the cool of the day
[2534.20 --> 2535.42]  There's that word walking
[2535.42 --> 2538.14]  And they hid
[2538.14 --> 2539.38]  From the Lord God
[2539.38 --> 2540.72]  Among the trees
[2540.72 --> 2541.42]  Of the garden
[2541.42 --> 2543.60]  So here we are
[2543.60 --> 2544.46]  In the garden of Eden
[2544.46 --> 2545.12]  Adam and Eve
[2545.12 --> 2546.38]  Had just disobeyed God
[2546.38 --> 2548.28]  They heard the sound
[2548.28 --> 2549.20]  Of the Lord God
[2549.20 --> 2550.80]  Walking in the garden
[2550.80 --> 2553.04]  And they were afraid
[2553.04 --> 2554.08]  And they hid
[2554.08 --> 2555.16]  From the Lord
[2555.16 --> 2556.22]  Among the trees
[2556.22 --> 2558.64]  Now you know
[2558.64 --> 2559.38]  What we learn
[2559.38 --> 2559.98]  From this verse
[2559.98 --> 2562.18]  We learn something amazing
[2562.18 --> 2562.94]  We learn that
[2562.94 --> 2564.06]  In the very beginning
[2564.06 --> 2564.68]  Of time
[2564.68 --> 2565.60]  Right
[2565.60 --> 2566.60]  In the world
[2566.60 --> 2568.64]  As it originally was
[2568.64 --> 2569.42]  Before sin
[2569.42 --> 2570.38]  Came into the world
[2570.38 --> 2571.56]  What we learn
[2571.56 --> 2572.16]  Is that God
[2572.16 --> 2573.36]  Took long walks
[2573.36 --> 2575.50]  That's cool about God
[2575.50 --> 2577.16]  God took long walks
[2577.16 --> 2578.36]  And it says
[2578.36 --> 2580.14]  In the cool of the day
[2580.14 --> 2581.18]  Which is in that part
[2581.18 --> 2581.68]  Of the world
[2581.68 --> 2582.72]  In the evening
[2582.72 --> 2584.24]  That's when the breeze
[2584.24 --> 2584.98]  Would come up
[2584.98 --> 2586.38]  In the cool of the day
[2586.38 --> 2587.58]  And we are told
[2587.58 --> 2588.32]  That he used to
[2588.32 --> 2589.10]  Take a walk
[2589.10 --> 2590.30]  That we
[2590.30 --> 2591.04]  Adam and Eve
[2591.04 --> 2592.22]  We used to take a walk
[2592.22 --> 2592.76]  With God
[2592.76 --> 2593.46]  In the cool
[2593.46 --> 2594.86]  Of the evening
[2594.86 --> 2597.96]  And that's pretty incredible
[2597.96 --> 2599.26]  Because who is this God
[2599.26 --> 2599.96]  This is the God
[2599.96 --> 2600.70]  Who had just
[2600.70 --> 2602.38]  Created all things
[2602.38 --> 2603.36]  All things in heaven
[2603.36 --> 2604.36]  And on earth
[2604.36 --> 2605.64]  Who holds it all together
[2605.64 --> 2607.34]  By the word of his power
[2607.34 --> 2608.60]  The Lord of the universe
[2608.60 --> 2610.36]  And it's this God
[2610.36 --> 2611.28]  Who every evening
[2611.28 --> 2612.28]  Would come to us
[2612.28 --> 2612.74]  And say
[2612.74 --> 2614.18]  Let's take a walk together
[2614.18 --> 2615.98]  I want to
[2615.98 --> 2617.72]  Hear what's on your heart
[2617.72 --> 2619.48]  I want to share with you
[2619.48 --> 2620.54]  What is on my heart
[2620.54 --> 2622.06]  And it's this picture
[2622.06 --> 2624.32]  Of the fellowship
[2624.32 --> 2625.00]  And the intimacy
[2625.00 --> 2626.44]  That we had with God
[2626.44 --> 2627.96]  We enjoyed this deep
[2627.96 --> 2629.58]  Communion with God
[2629.58 --> 2631.28]  And that's the kind
[2631.28 --> 2632.38]  Of relationship with God
[2632.38 --> 2633.92]  That we were all created for
[2633.92 --> 2635.88]  But then what happens
[2635.88 --> 2636.84]  In the biblical story
[2636.84 --> 2638.26]  As soon as Adam and Eve
[2638.26 --> 2639.18]  Disobeyed God
[2639.18 --> 2640.26]  The intimacy
[2640.26 --> 2641.26]  They had with God
[2641.26 --> 2641.96]  Was lost
[2641.96 --> 2643.92]  And we all know
[2643.92 --> 2644.66]  A little bit about
[2644.66 --> 2645.50]  What that's like
[2645.50 --> 2646.20]  In our own lives
[2646.20 --> 2646.46]  Right?
[2646.80 --> 2647.62]  So imagine
[2647.62 --> 2649.30]  Or think to the time
[2649.30 --> 2650.16]  When maybe you have
[2650.16 --> 2651.24]  Wronged someone else
[2651.24 --> 2654.24]  And you see them coming
[2654.24 --> 2655.70]  What do you do?
[2657.62 --> 2659.32]  You hope they don't see you
[2659.32 --> 2661.52]  And you avoid them
[2661.52 --> 2662.84]  Maybe you hide
[2662.84 --> 2665.74]  And that's what Adam and Eve do
[2665.74 --> 2666.74]  Right?
[2666.74 --> 2668.08]  And because of sin
[2668.08 --> 2669.06]  They no longer
[2669.06 --> 2670.16]  Can walk with God
[2670.16 --> 2671.48]  They actually instead
[2671.48 --> 2672.66]  Hide from God
[2672.66 --> 2674.06]  You know
[2674.06 --> 2675.22]  And so we were estranged
[2675.22 --> 2675.76]  From God
[2675.76 --> 2676.74]  And we hide from him
[2676.74 --> 2678.96]  And as we keep reading
[2678.96 --> 2680.72]  In Genesis chapters 3 and 4
[2680.72 --> 2681.28]  You know
[2681.28 --> 2682.80]  Our hearts just sink
[2682.80 --> 2683.48]  Because
[2683.48 --> 2686.24]  Our estrangement from God
[2686.24 --> 2688.24]  Results in all kinds of other
[2688.24 --> 2690.00]  Like we can't walk with anybody
[2690.00 --> 2691.40]  Not with ourselves
[2691.40 --> 2692.20]  Not with others
[2692.20 --> 2693.36]  And not in this world
[2693.36 --> 2694.90]  Because we see death
[2694.90 --> 2697.02]  And we see violence
[2697.02 --> 2697.96]  And war
[2697.96 --> 2699.32]  And the whole thing
[2699.32 --> 2700.00]  Just goes downhill
[2700.00 --> 2700.60]  Very quickly
[2700.60 --> 2703.34]  And that's what we see
[2703.34 --> 2704.38]  Unfolding
[2704.38 --> 2706.48]  In Genesis 3 and 4
[2706.48 --> 2707.34]  Because of our sin
[2707.34 --> 2708.46]  But then we keep reading
[2708.46 --> 2709.64]  And Genesis 5
[2709.64 --> 2710.40]  Comes along
[2710.40 --> 2711.86]  And we read about
[2711.86 --> 2713.32]  These lists
[2713.32 --> 2714.54]  Of these
[2714.54 --> 2716.16]  Forbearers
[2716.16 --> 2717.06]  This genealogy
[2717.06 --> 2718.40]  And we get to Enoch
[2718.40 --> 2719.40]  And it says
[2719.40 --> 2721.78]  Enoch walked with God
[2721.78 --> 2723.50]  And we say
[2723.50 --> 2724.06]  Wait what?
[2725.78 --> 2726.30]  Right?
[2726.34 --> 2727.12]  What just happened?
[2728.08 --> 2728.22]  Right?
[2728.30 --> 2729.44]  Somebody can still
[2729.44 --> 2730.42]  Walk with God?
[2732.22 --> 2732.90]  Right?
[2732.94 --> 2734.08]  It's possible
[2734.08 --> 2735.02]  To still have
[2735.02 --> 2735.64]  That kind of
[2735.64 --> 2737.06]  Deep fellowship
[2737.06 --> 2737.68]  And communion
[2737.68 --> 2738.46]  With God?
[2738.46 --> 2740.46]  And yes
[2740.46 --> 2741.44]  That is what
[2741.44 --> 2742.52]  Enoch did
[2742.52 --> 2745.36]  For 300 years
[2745.36 --> 2747.58]  He walked with God
[2747.58 --> 2749.28]  Step by step
[2749.28 --> 2750.86]  And then God took him
[2750.86 --> 2753.10]  One commentator I read
[2753.10 --> 2753.56]  Said this
[2753.56 --> 2754.86]  Enoch had been
[2754.86 --> 2755.70]  Walking with God
[2755.70 --> 2756.82]  For so many years
[2756.82 --> 2758.08]  That his transfer
[2758.08 --> 2758.70]  To heaven
[2758.70 --> 2759.90]  Was not even
[2759.90 --> 2760.92]  An interruption
[2760.92 --> 2763.08]  Is that cool?
[2763.80 --> 2764.28]  Imagine that
[2764.28 --> 2765.08]  Just walking with God
[2765.08 --> 2765.86]  Walking with God
[2765.86 --> 2767.70]  Right into heaven
[2767.70 --> 2768.46]  Didn't even notice
[2768.46 --> 2768.98]  The difference
[2768.98 --> 2771.72]  Now
[2771.72 --> 2773.46]  How is that possible?
[2774.84 --> 2775.84]  That's the question
[2775.84 --> 2777.46]  How is it possible
[2777.46 --> 2779.38]  To walk with God?
[2780.32 --> 2781.00]  To have that kind of
[2781.00 --> 2782.12]  Communion with God?
[2782.92 --> 2783.70]  And you know
[2783.70 --> 2784.76]  That the answer
[2784.76 --> 2785.68]  Of the book of Hebrews
[2785.68 --> 2787.08]  Is this
[2787.08 --> 2788.08]  That it is possible
[2788.08 --> 2789.26]  By faith
[2789.26 --> 2790.56]  Okay?
[2790.68 --> 2791.52]  And it's possible
[2791.52 --> 2792.04]  By faith
[2792.04 --> 2792.62]  And what that means
[2792.62 --> 2793.62]  Is you can do it too
[2793.62 --> 2795.08]  Right?
[2795.16 --> 2795.66]  You can do it
[2795.66 --> 2796.72]  You can walk with God
[2796.72 --> 2797.88]  By faith
[2797.88 --> 2799.66]  And walking with God
[2799.66 --> 2800.52]  Is this image
[2800.52 --> 2801.22]  It's a metaphor
[2801.22 --> 2802.26]  That we see
[2802.26 --> 2803.06]  Throughout the Bible
[2803.06 --> 2803.84]  It's a metaphor
[2803.84 --> 2804.80]  That describes
[2804.80 --> 2806.02]  What it means
[2806.02 --> 2806.96]  To be a Christian
[2806.96 --> 2808.12]  A Christian is someone
[2808.12 --> 2810.46]  Who walks with God
[2810.46 --> 2813.60]  And we get a picture here
[2813.60 --> 2814.36]  In Hebrews 11
[2814.36 --> 2816.08]  Of just what this looks like
[2816.08 --> 2817.22]  What does it look like
[2817.22 --> 2818.16]  To walk with God?
[2818.24 --> 2819.50]  What is the nature of faith?
[2820.00 --> 2820.56]  Where we
[2820.56 --> 2821.76]  In faith
[2821.76 --> 2822.92]  Walk along with God
[2822.92 --> 2824.18]  And we find it
[2824.18 --> 2824.94]  In verse 6
[2824.94 --> 2825.64]  In our passage
[2825.64 --> 2827.86]  So this is what it says
[2827.86 --> 2829.80]  And without faith
[2829.80 --> 2830.56]  It is impossible
[2830.56 --> 2831.88]  To please God
[2831.88 --> 2832.66]  Or remember
[2832.66 --> 2833.74]  To walk with God
[2833.74 --> 2834.96]  Because anyone
[2834.96 --> 2836.42]  Who comes to him
[2836.42 --> 2837.86]  Must believe
[2837.86 --> 2838.96]  That he exists
[2838.96 --> 2841.02]  And that he rewards
[2841.02 --> 2842.22]  Those who earnestly
[2842.22 --> 2843.38]  Seek him
[2843.38 --> 2846.12]  So what does faith
[2846.12 --> 2846.84]  Look like?
[2847.90 --> 2848.74]  What does faith look like?
[2848.78 --> 2850.10]  And the answer here
[2850.10 --> 2851.62]  In the case of Enoch
[2851.62 --> 2852.60]  Is twofold
[2852.60 --> 2854.28]  And the first point
[2854.28 --> 2854.80]  Of faith
[2854.80 --> 2855.80]  That the writer of Hebrews
[2855.80 --> 2856.34]  Brings up
[2856.34 --> 2856.84]  Is this
[2856.84 --> 2858.42]  Just simply this
[2858.42 --> 2859.54]  Do you believe
[2859.54 --> 2861.32]  That God exists?
[2862.20 --> 2863.50]  Or literally in the Greek
[2863.50 --> 2864.08]  Do you believe
[2864.08 --> 2864.98]  That God is?
[2866.06 --> 2867.48]  That he exists
[2867.48 --> 2868.44]  That he is the God
[2868.44 --> 2868.94]  Who is
[2868.94 --> 2870.72]  I am who I am
[2870.72 --> 2871.86]  The God who exists
[2871.86 --> 2874.16]  Do you believe
[2874.16 --> 2874.90]  That God exists?
[2875.04 --> 2875.82]  That's not a given
[2875.82 --> 2877.04]  It wasn't a given
[2877.04 --> 2878.26]  In Enoch's time
[2878.26 --> 2879.48]  When people were
[2879.48 --> 2880.42]  Hiding from God
[2880.42 --> 2880.94]  And worshipping
[2880.94 --> 2881.72]  False gods
[2881.72 --> 2883.22]  And walking
[2883.22 --> 2884.18]  Not with God
[2884.18 --> 2885.24]  But in every other way
[2885.24 --> 2886.26]  The ways of violence
[2886.26 --> 2887.96]  And it's not a given
[2887.96 --> 2889.16]  In our day either
[2889.16 --> 2890.26]  Where people also
[2890.26 --> 2891.26]  Worship false idols
[2891.26 --> 2893.28]  Maybe not other gods
[2893.28 --> 2894.56]  But the gods of money
[2894.56 --> 2895.18]  And power
[2895.18 --> 2896.72]  And all kinds of things
[2896.72 --> 2899.88]  But what does it mean
[2899.88 --> 2901.28]  To believe that God exists?
[2902.58 --> 2903.90]  Well as we look
[2903.90 --> 2905.72]  In Hebrews chapter 11
[2905.72 --> 2908.22]  In the context of this verse
[2908.22 --> 2910.04]  We find a couple things
[2910.04 --> 2910.98]  About what it means
[2910.98 --> 2912.10]  To believe in the God
[2912.10 --> 2912.66]  That exists
[2912.66 --> 2914.46]  First to believe in this God
[2914.46 --> 2915.26]  You've got to believe
[2915.26 --> 2916.84]  In the great creator God
[2916.84 --> 2917.96]  Of Genesis chapter 1
[2917.96 --> 2920.00]  To say that God exists
[2920.00 --> 2921.02]  Is to believe in a God
[2921.02 --> 2922.64]  Who created all things
[2922.64 --> 2924.44]  Who spoke everything
[2924.44 --> 2925.72]  Into existence
[2925.72 --> 2926.30]  Out of nothing
[2926.30 --> 2928.28]  And so if you look
[2928.28 --> 2929.70]  At verse 3 of our passage
[2929.70 --> 2930.30]  Verse 3
[2930.30 --> 2931.84]  It says by faith
[2931.84 --> 2933.18]  We understand
[2933.18 --> 2934.28]  That the universe
[2934.28 --> 2936.24]  Was formed at God's command
[2936.24 --> 2937.80]  So that what is seen
[2937.80 --> 2939.00]  Was not made
[2939.00 --> 2940.46]  Out of what was visible
[2940.46 --> 2943.26]  So do you believe
[2943.26 --> 2944.08]  That God spoke
[2944.08 --> 2945.06]  All of creation
[2945.06 --> 2946.18]  Into existence
[2946.18 --> 2948.40]  And that he rules
[2948.40 --> 2950.16]  And sustains it all
[2950.16 --> 2952.30]  You know as God
[2952.30 --> 2953.10]  Brought all things
[2953.10 --> 2953.76]  Into being
[2953.76 --> 2955.14]  The morning stars
[2955.14 --> 2956.42]  Sang together
[2956.42 --> 2958.16]  And all the angels
[2958.16 --> 2959.30]  Shouted for joy
[2959.30 --> 2961.42]  Job 38 7
[2961.42 --> 2963.90]  But not only that
[2963.90 --> 2964.96]  To believe in the God
[2964.96 --> 2965.48]  Who exists
[2965.48 --> 2966.10]  Is also
[2966.10 --> 2966.70]  It means
[2966.70 --> 2967.34]  To believe
[2967.34 --> 2969.42]  Not only in the creator God
[2969.42 --> 2971.90]  But in a God
[2971.90 --> 2973.66]  Who is a personal God
[2973.66 --> 2975.52]  And who made us
[2975.52 --> 2976.38]  To worship him
[2976.38 --> 2978.34]  And to relate to him
[2978.34 --> 2978.92]  In righteousness
[2978.92 --> 2980.18]  And so we see that
[2980.18 --> 2980.82]  In verse 4
[2980.82 --> 2982.06]  Of our passage
[2982.06 --> 2983.36]  It talks about Abel
[2983.36 --> 2984.48]  It says
[2984.48 --> 2985.32]  By faith
[2985.32 --> 2986.58]  Abel
[2986.58 --> 2987.50]  Brought God
[2987.50 --> 2988.46]  A better offering
[2988.46 --> 2989.32]  Than Cain did
[2989.32 --> 2990.18]  Why was it better?
[2990.76 --> 2991.88]  Because it was an offering
[2991.88 --> 2992.58]  From his heart
[2992.58 --> 2993.82]  In faith
[2993.82 --> 2995.32]  By faith
[2995.32 --> 2996.04]  He was commended
[2996.04 --> 2996.82]  As righteous
[2996.82 --> 2998.24]  When God spoke well
[2998.24 --> 2998.88]  Of his offering
[2998.88 --> 2999.82]  And by faith
[2999.82 --> 3000.98]  Abel still speaks
[3000.98 --> 3002.28]  Even though he is dead
[3002.28 --> 3004.36]  So friends
[3004.36 --> 3004.78]  What does it mean
[3004.78 --> 3005.58]  To believe in the God
[3005.58 --> 3006.18]  Who exists?
[3007.30 --> 3008.22]  It means to believe
[3008.22 --> 3009.76]  That he created all things
[3009.76 --> 3011.40]  And that he is
[3011.40 --> 3012.58]  A personal creator
[3012.58 --> 3013.26]  He's a God
[3013.26 --> 3014.84]  Who wants to relate
[3014.84 --> 3015.44]  To us
[3015.44 --> 3016.16]  Who wants us
[3016.16 --> 3016.94]  To know him
[3016.94 --> 3018.30]  And to worship him
[3018.30 --> 3020.32]  And to relate
[3020.32 --> 3020.74]  To him
[3020.74 --> 3021.28]  In righteousness
[3021.28 --> 3025.60]  But the way
[3025.60 --> 3026.16]  That we come
[3026.16 --> 3027.00]  To know this God
[3027.00 --> 3027.70]  The way that we come
[3027.70 --> 3028.72]  To worship God
[3028.72 --> 3029.34]  Rightly
[3029.34 --> 3030.80]  Is through
[3030.80 --> 3032.34]  Our Lord Jesus Christ
[3032.34 --> 3033.76]  Who is the founder
[3033.76 --> 3034.62]  And the perfecter
[3034.62 --> 3035.58]  Of our faith
[3035.58 --> 3036.86]  And so the book
[3036.86 --> 3037.36]  Of Hebrews
[3037.36 --> 3038.72]  Begins with Jesus
[3038.72 --> 3040.24]  In chapter 1
[3040.24 --> 3041.20]  Verses 1 to 2
[3041.20 --> 3042.36]  This is what it says
[3042.36 --> 3042.92]  In the past
[3042.92 --> 3043.90]  God spoke to
[3043.90 --> 3044.76]  Our ancestors
[3044.76 --> 3046.16]  Through the prophets
[3046.16 --> 3047.14]  At many times
[3047.14 --> 3048.48]  And in various ways
[3048.48 --> 3050.18]  But in these last days
[3050.18 --> 3051.66]  He spoke to us
[3051.66 --> 3053.02]  By his son
[3053.02 --> 3054.36]  Whom he appointed
[3054.36 --> 3055.40]  Heir of all things
[3055.40 --> 3055.92]  Through whom
[3055.92 --> 3056.70]  He also made
[3056.70 --> 3057.34]  The universe
[3057.34 --> 3058.84]  Friends
[3058.84 --> 3059.84]  Jesus is the
[3059.84 --> 3061.46]  Ultimate revelation
[3061.46 --> 3063.40]  Of who God is
[3063.40 --> 3064.16]  It goes on to say
[3064.16 --> 3065.20]  He is God of God
[3065.20 --> 3066.34]  He is light of light
[3066.34 --> 3068.36]  We see Jesus
[3068.36 --> 3069.88]  And we see God
[3069.88 --> 3071.98]  And to believe
[3071.98 --> 3072.84]  That God exists
[3072.84 --> 3073.18]  Therefore
[3073.18 --> 3074.26]  Means to believe
[3074.26 --> 3075.68]  In Jesus Christ
[3075.68 --> 3076.20]  You can't say
[3076.20 --> 3076.94]  I believe in God
[3076.94 --> 3077.58]  And not believe
[3077.58 --> 3078.52]  In Jesus Christ
[3078.52 --> 3080.42]  And it is through
[3080.42 --> 3081.40]  Faith in Jesus
[3081.40 --> 3082.44]  That our relationship
[3082.44 --> 3083.16]  With God
[3083.16 --> 3084.24]  Can be healed
[3084.24 --> 3085.52]  Because Jesus
[3085.52 --> 3086.80]  Is the true
[3086.80 --> 3087.76]  And the final
[3087.76 --> 3088.44]  Offering
[3088.44 --> 3089.48]  For sin
[3089.48 --> 3091.00]  As he died
[3091.00 --> 3091.46]  On the cross
[3091.46 --> 3091.76]  For us
[3091.76 --> 3092.16]  So that
[3092.16 --> 3092.88]  That offering
[3092.88 --> 3093.50]  That God made
[3093.50 --> 3094.12]  To Abel
[3094.12 --> 3095.38]  Probably a sin
[3095.38 --> 3095.88]  Offering
[3095.88 --> 3097.10]  That was fulfilled
[3097.10 --> 3098.10]  And brought to
[3098.10 --> 3098.74]  Its fulfillment
[3098.74 --> 3100.08]  In Jesus Christ
[3100.08 --> 3100.66]  On the cross
[3100.66 --> 3102.36]  And friends
[3102.36 --> 3103.38]  That is all
[3103.38 --> 3104.02]  That it means
[3104.02 --> 3104.76]  To believe
[3104.76 --> 3105.44]  In God
[3105.44 --> 3107.50]  To believe
[3107.50 --> 3108.28]  That God exists
[3108.28 --> 3109.06]  To believe
[3109.06 --> 3110.44]  What Enoch
[3110.44 --> 3111.14]  Believed
[3111.14 --> 3113.12]  And because
[3113.12 --> 3113.70]  He believed
[3113.70 --> 3114.48]  In this God
[3114.48 --> 3116.10]  He walked
[3116.10 --> 3116.68]  With God
[3116.68 --> 3118.02]  And it pleased
[3118.02 --> 3118.44]  God
[3118.44 --> 3120.64]  Okay but
[3120.64 --> 3121.26]  But finally
[3121.26 --> 3121.90]  There's a second
[3121.90 --> 3122.70]  Point of faith
[3122.70 --> 3123.22]  That we see
[3123.22 --> 3123.92]  In verse 6
[3123.92 --> 3125.40]  It says
[3125.40 --> 3127.08]  Without faith
[3127.08 --> 3127.70]  It's impossible
[3127.70 --> 3128.44]  To please God
[3128.44 --> 3129.14]  Because anyone
[3129.14 --> 3130.04]  Who comes to him
[3130.04 --> 3130.54]  Must believe
[3130.54 --> 3131.34]  That he exists
[3131.34 --> 3133.88]  And that he
[3133.88 --> 3134.64]  Rewards
[3134.64 --> 3135.84]  Those who
[3135.84 --> 3136.74]  Earnestly seek him
[3136.74 --> 3138.70]  So what is
[3138.70 --> 3139.38]  The reward
[3139.38 --> 3140.82]  Of walking
[3140.82 --> 3141.34]  With God
[3141.34 --> 3143.80]  What's this reward
[3143.80 --> 3144.80]  That the writer
[3144.80 --> 3145.46]  Of Hebrews
[3145.46 --> 3146.18]  Refers to
[3146.18 --> 3147.82]  Well it's simply
[3147.82 --> 3148.50]  The reward
[3148.50 --> 3149.88]  Of drawing
[3149.88 --> 3150.58]  Drawing near
[3150.58 --> 3151.08]  To God
[3151.08 --> 3152.14]  It's the
[3152.14 --> 3152.86]  It's the reward
[3152.86 --> 3154.22]  Of knowing God
[3154.22 --> 3155.42]  Of having that
[3155.42 --> 3156.54]  Deep communion
[3156.54 --> 3157.64]  In the fellowship
[3157.64 --> 3158.58]  For which we
[3158.58 --> 3159.14]  Were created
[3159.14 --> 3160.26]  That is the reward
[3160.26 --> 3162.02]  That and that's
[3162.02 --> 3162.58]  The promise
[3162.58 --> 3163.54]  That meant
[3163.54 --> 3164.44]  So much
[3164.44 --> 3165.04]  To Enoch
[3165.04 --> 3167.28]  Okay it's
[3167.28 --> 3167.90]  The promise
[3167.90 --> 3168.98]  That Enoch
[3168.98 --> 3170.42]  Looked with
[3170.42 --> 3171.02]  The eyes of
[3171.02 --> 3171.82]  Faith toward
[3171.82 --> 3172.92]  To that he
[3172.92 --> 3173.58]  Could not yet
[3173.58 --> 3175.04]  See but that
[3175.04 --> 3175.98]  Shaped the course
[3175.98 --> 3176.86]  Of his whole life
[3176.86 --> 3178.90]  It's as if
[3178.90 --> 3179.54]  He is saying
[3179.54 --> 3180.80]  I live as
[3180.80 --> 3181.32]  I do
[3181.32 --> 3182.28]  I live as
[3182.28 --> 3182.94]  I must
[3182.94 --> 3183.76]  Because I
[3183.76 --> 3184.28]  Have faith
[3184.28 --> 3184.84]  That God
[3184.84 --> 3185.86]  Will accomplish
[3185.86 --> 3187.62]  His promises
[3187.62 --> 3188.18]  To me
[3188.18 --> 3189.48]  And the promise
[3189.48 --> 3190.04]  Is that he
[3190.04 --> 3190.84]  Will reward
[3190.84 --> 3191.94]  Those who seek
[3191.94 --> 3192.20]  Him
[3192.20 --> 3193.80]  He will draw
[3193.80 --> 3194.32]  Near
[3194.32 --> 3195.38]  To us
[3195.38 --> 3197.16]  Right
[3197.16 --> 3197.92]  God has promised
[3197.92 --> 3198.88]  That for those
[3198.88 --> 3199.60]  Who seek him
[3199.60 --> 3201.54]  We will find him
[3201.54 --> 3203.52]  You know
[3203.52 --> 3204.40]  And so as we
[3204.40 --> 3205.26]  Were singing earlier
[3205.26 --> 3205.94]  Remember we sang
[3205.94 --> 3206.34]  That song
[3206.34 --> 3207.24]  Speak oh lord
[3207.24 --> 3209.00]  The very last verse
[3209.00 --> 3210.02]  Kind of close to the end
[3210.02 --> 3210.74]  It says this
[3210.74 --> 3212.44]  And by grace
[3212.44 --> 3213.94]  Will stand
[3213.94 --> 3215.18]  On your promises
[3215.18 --> 3216.58]  And by faith
[3216.58 --> 3217.24]  Will walk
[3217.24 --> 3218.20]  As you walk
[3218.20 --> 3218.72]  With us
[3218.72 --> 3220.04]  You know I think
[3220.04 --> 3220.84]  That's a pretty good
[3220.84 --> 3221.62]  Explanation
[3221.62 --> 3222.72]  In a picture
[3222.72 --> 3223.48]  Of what is being
[3223.48 --> 3224.02]  Said here
[3224.02 --> 3225.84]  Right the preacher
[3225.84 --> 3226.88]  Of Hebrews is saying
[3226.88 --> 3227.90]  That faith in God's
[3227.90 --> 3228.52]  Promises
[3228.52 --> 3230.08]  Proceeds
[3230.08 --> 3231.24]  And then produces
[3231.24 --> 3232.16]  A walk which
[3232.16 --> 3232.84]  Pleases God
[3232.84 --> 3234.12]  How can you walk
[3234.12 --> 3234.60]  With God
[3234.60 --> 3235.72]  You have faith in God
[3235.72 --> 3236.38]  You have faith in his
[3236.38 --> 3236.82]  Promises
[3236.82 --> 3238.28]  And then that produces
[3238.28 --> 3240.18]  A walk
[3240.18 --> 3241.36]  Which pleases God
[3241.36 --> 3242.64]  See it's all
[3242.64 --> 3243.28]  It's very simple
[3243.28 --> 3244.32]  This morning
[3244.32 --> 3246.30]  Do you love to go
[3246.30 --> 3246.78]  On walks
[3246.78 --> 3249.48]  I like to go on walks
[3249.48 --> 3250.14]  Today would be a
[3250.14 --> 3250.96]  Beautiful day for a walk
[3250.96 --> 3251.34]  Wouldn't it
[3251.34 --> 3252.70]  So
[3252.70 --> 3254.34]  Maybe you'll go
[3254.34 --> 3255.26]  On a walk later today
[3255.26 --> 3256.16]  And imagine you're
[3256.16 --> 3257.34]  On a walk with
[3257.34 --> 3258.28]  Your dog
[3258.28 --> 3259.62]  Or your spouse
[3259.62 --> 3261.32]  Leave the spouse
[3261.32 --> 3261.58]  At home
[3261.58 --> 3262.18]  Take the dog
[3262.18 --> 3262.64]  I don't know
[3262.64 --> 3264.54]  Or bring the kids
[3264.54 --> 3265.28]  Or leave them at home
[3265.28 --> 3266.50]  Or your
[3266.50 --> 3267.26]  Friend
[3267.26 --> 3268.14]  Whoever you're with
[3268.14 --> 3268.94]  You're taking a walk
[3268.94 --> 3271.02]  What does it mean
[3271.02 --> 3272.16]  To walk with someone
[3272.16 --> 3273.94]  What does it mean
[3273.94 --> 3274.96]  To walk with someone
[3274.96 --> 3276.22]  Well if you're gonna
[3276.22 --> 3276.62]  I mean
[3276.62 --> 3278.34]  You know it's pretty simple
[3278.34 --> 3279.08]  But if you're gonna
[3279.08 --> 3279.96]  Walk with someone
[3279.96 --> 3280.86]  Well first of all
[3280.86 --> 3281.44]  You've gotta go
[3281.44 --> 3282.52]  Toward the same destination
[3282.52 --> 3282.92]  Right
[3282.92 --> 3285.14]  You can't walk with someone
[3285.14 --> 3286.00]  If you're going
[3286.00 --> 3286.94]  In separate directions
[3286.94 --> 3287.76]  If you're going
[3287.76 --> 3288.64]  To separate places
[3288.64 --> 3290.50]  Okay so to walk
[3290.50 --> 3290.76]  With someone
[3290.76 --> 3291.42]  We have to be going
[3291.42 --> 3292.28]  To the same place
[3292.28 --> 3293.52]  Right
[3293.52 --> 3294.14]  And so
[3294.14 --> 3295.30]  You think of Enoch
[3295.30 --> 3296.36]  Kind of fulfilling
[3296.36 --> 3297.58]  Colossians 3
[3297.58 --> 3299.18]  Far before Paul
[3299.18 --> 3299.94]  Wrote it
[3299.94 --> 3300.70]  Where it says
[3300.70 --> 3301.76]  To set your mind
[3301.76 --> 3302.56]  On things above
[3302.56 --> 3304.18]  Not unearthly things
[3304.18 --> 3305.04]  Set your mind
[3305.04 --> 3305.78]  On things above
[3305.78 --> 3306.68]  Where Christ
[3306.68 --> 3307.32]  Is seated
[3307.32 --> 3307.90]  At the right hand
[3307.90 --> 3308.34]  Of God
[3308.34 --> 3309.22]  So that's kind of
[3309.22 --> 3309.88]  Our destination
[3309.88 --> 3311.14]  That God is walking
[3311.14 --> 3311.88]  And we are walking
[3311.88 --> 3312.36]  With him
[3312.36 --> 3314.72]  But the other thing
[3314.72 --> 3315.82]  Is you can't be walking
[3315.82 --> 3317.58]  You can be walking
[3317.58 --> 3318.74]  Towards the same destination
[3318.74 --> 3319.64]  But still not walking
[3319.64 --> 3320.32]  Together
[3320.32 --> 3321.94]  Right
[3321.94 --> 3322.40]  You could take
[3322.40 --> 3323.16]  A different path
[3323.16 --> 3325.60]  Or you could be walking
[3325.60 --> 3326.50]  At a different pace
[3326.50 --> 3327.68]  Right
[3327.68 --> 3328.36]  And so
[3328.36 --> 3329.76]  To walk with God
[3329.76 --> 3331.02]  Is to walk
[3331.02 --> 3332.70]  Alongside God
[3332.70 --> 3334.14]  At the same pace
[3334.14 --> 3334.46]  As God
[3334.46 --> 3335.82]  Not running ahead
[3335.82 --> 3336.98]  And asking God
[3336.98 --> 3337.56]  To catch up
[3337.56 --> 3339.74]  Not trailing behind
[3339.74 --> 3341.30]  Where we lose sight
[3341.30 --> 3341.70]  Of him
[3341.70 --> 3342.68]  But walking
[3342.68 --> 3343.86]  Side by side
[3343.86 --> 3344.62]  With our creator
[3344.62 --> 3345.68]  Right
[3345.68 --> 3346.56]  Walking in the way
[3346.56 --> 3347.08]  That God
[3347.08 --> 3348.10]  Intended
[3348.10 --> 3349.62]  Us to walk
[3349.62 --> 3350.78]  On the same path
[3350.78 --> 3351.66]  With him
[3351.66 --> 3353.40]  Toward the same destination
[3353.40 --> 3355.64]  Malachi
[3355.64 --> 3356.80]  Chapter 2
[3356.80 --> 3357.30]  Verse 6
[3357.30 --> 3357.96]  It describes
[3357.96 --> 3358.60]  Such a walk
[3358.60 --> 3359.64]  It's talking about
[3359.64 --> 3360.96]  The priests
[3360.96 --> 3362.58]  Who serve God
[3362.58 --> 3363.14]  Faithfully
[3363.14 --> 3364.26]  And God says
[3364.26 --> 3364.90]  This about them
[3364.90 --> 3365.72]  True instruction
[3365.72 --> 3367.08]  Was in his mouth
[3367.08 --> 3367.60]  The priest
[3367.60 --> 3368.70]  Nothing false
[3368.70 --> 3369.98]  Was found on his lips
[3369.98 --> 3370.90]  And then note this
[3370.90 --> 3372.14]  He walked
[3372.14 --> 3372.96]  With me
[3372.96 --> 3374.20]  In peace
[3374.20 --> 3375.66]  And uprightness
[3375.66 --> 3377.00]  And turned many
[3377.00 --> 3377.54]  From sin
[3377.54 --> 3379.98]  To walk
[3379.98 --> 3380.62]  With God
[3380.62 --> 3381.42]  Is to walk
[3381.42 --> 3382.20]  In the ways
[3382.20 --> 3383.14]  Of God
[3383.14 --> 3384.38]  In peace
[3384.38 --> 3385.58]  And in uprightness
[3385.58 --> 3387.04]  And friends
[3387.04 --> 3387.80]  This is
[3387.80 --> 3388.94]  A picture
[3388.94 --> 3389.86]  A simple picture
[3389.86 --> 3391.22]  But a picture
[3391.22 --> 3392.10]  Of a life
[3392.10 --> 3393.28]  Lived in faith
[3393.28 --> 3395.54]  And God promises
[3395.54 --> 3396.34]  To reward
[3396.34 --> 3397.80]  Those who seek him
[3397.80 --> 3398.48]  And he draws
[3398.48 --> 3399.38]  Near to them
[3399.38 --> 3400.34]  And he draws
[3400.34 --> 3401.98]  Us near to himself
[3401.98 --> 3404.00]  You know
[3404.00 --> 3404.64]  We often
[3404.64 --> 3405.62]  Hide from God
[3405.62 --> 3407.62]  Even as believers
[3407.62 --> 3408.16]  But God
[3408.16 --> 3409.22]  Never hides
[3409.22 --> 3409.78]  From us
[3409.78 --> 3411.84]  And the Bible
[3411.84 --> 3412.38]  Says that
[3412.38 --> 3413.80]  When we seek him
[3413.80 --> 3416.14]  He allows himself
[3416.14 --> 3416.80]  To be found
[3416.80 --> 3417.36]  By us
[3417.36 --> 3418.76]  And when we
[3418.76 --> 3419.20]  Seek him
[3419.20 --> 3419.92]  He's the one
[3419.92 --> 3420.38]  Who actually
[3420.38 --> 3421.02]  Gives us
[3421.02 --> 3421.84]  The faith
[3421.84 --> 3422.66]  To believe
[3422.66 --> 3423.74]  Right
[3423.74 --> 3424.20]  For faith
[3424.20 --> 3424.86]  Is God's gift
[3424.86 --> 3425.22]  To us
[3425.22 --> 3425.66]  It's not our
[3425.66 --> 3426.20]  Own doing
[3426.20 --> 3427.58]  But it's by grace
[3427.58 --> 3428.60]  Not by works
[3428.60 --> 3429.32]  So that no one
[3429.32 --> 3429.90]  Can boast
[3429.90 --> 3431.82]  And even though
[3431.82 --> 3432.62]  Faith is actually
[3432.62 --> 3433.20]  A gift
[3433.20 --> 3433.92]  Of God's grace
[3433.92 --> 3434.58]  To us
[3434.58 --> 3436.54]  Enoch
[3436.54 --> 3437.38]  Was commended
[3437.38 --> 3438.34]  For his faith
[3438.34 --> 3439.62]  Even though
[3439.62 --> 3440.26]  It wasn't something
[3440.26 --> 3440.92]  That he had
[3440.92 --> 3441.68]  In himself
[3441.68 --> 3442.56]  It was a gift
[3442.56 --> 3443.08]  Of God
[3443.08 --> 3443.68]  And God
[3443.68 --> 3444.80]  Grants that gift
[3444.80 --> 3445.56]  And he says
[3445.56 --> 3446.16]  Well done
[3446.16 --> 3448.10]  It's like grace
[3448.10 --> 3448.80]  Upon grace
[3448.80 --> 3450.72]  But what does it mean
[3450.72 --> 3451.52]  To be commended
[3451.52 --> 3453.56]  Well when you
[3453.56 --> 3454.04]  You know
[3454.04 --> 3455.10]  You admire someone
[3455.10 --> 3456.00]  Like a parent
[3456.00 --> 3457.60]  Or maybe
[3457.60 --> 3458.46]  A coach
[3458.46 --> 3459.66]  Or a teacher
[3459.66 --> 3460.62]  Or a boss
[3460.62 --> 3461.78]  And they say
[3461.78 --> 3463.12]  Something approving
[3463.12 --> 3464.18]  About you
[3464.18 --> 3465.88]  That's being commended
[3465.88 --> 3467.74]  And it feels good
[3467.74 --> 3469.38]  It's my love language
[3469.38 --> 3471.20]  To be commended
[3471.20 --> 3473.28]  And these men
[3473.28 --> 3473.70]  And women
[3473.70 --> 3474.56]  From the Old Testament
[3474.56 --> 3475.28]  Who are called
[3475.28 --> 3476.18]  The ancients
[3476.18 --> 3476.70]  Right
[3476.70 --> 3477.60]  They are not commended
[3477.60 --> 3478.42]  By parents
[3478.42 --> 3479.46]  Or peers
[3479.46 --> 3480.36]  By coaches
[3480.36 --> 3481.32]  Or by teachers
[3481.32 --> 3482.26]  Or by employers
[3482.26 --> 3483.22]  They are commended
[3483.22 --> 3484.16]  By God
[3484.16 --> 3486.64]  And brothers and sisters
[3486.64 --> 3488.18]  This is the approval
[3488.18 --> 3489.56]  That is worth seeking
[3489.56 --> 3490.72]  Right
[3490.72 --> 3492.50]  This is the commendation
[3492.50 --> 3494.20]  That is worth seeking
[3494.20 --> 3495.22]  With all of your heart
[3495.22 --> 3497.90]  So let's pray together
[3497.90 --> 3503.60]  Heavenly Father
[3503.60 --> 3504.62]  We thank you
[3504.62 --> 3505.70]  For your faithfulness
[3505.70 --> 3506.20]  To us
[3506.20 --> 3508.00]  It's a faithfulness
[3508.00 --> 3508.96]  That calls us
[3508.96 --> 3509.84]  To walk with you
[3509.84 --> 3511.80]  And it invites us
[3511.80 --> 3512.52]  To seek you
[3512.52 --> 3514.04]  And we thank you
[3514.04 --> 3514.20]  Lord
[3514.20 --> 3514.98]  That you reward
[3514.98 --> 3515.54]  Our seeking
[3515.54 --> 3516.82]  With your very presence
[3516.82 --> 3518.76]  You reward our seeking
[3518.76 --> 3519.90]  Lord
[3519.90 --> 3521.10]  With the deep
[3521.10 --> 3522.48]  Fellowship and communion
[3522.48 --> 3523.62]  That we were created for
[3523.62 --> 3524.28]  So Father
[3524.28 --> 3525.84]  We all want to walk with you
[3525.84 --> 3527.68]  Help us to do that
[3527.68 --> 3528.76]  And we ask it
[3528.76 --> 3529.42]  In Jesus name
[3529.42 --> 3530.12]  Amen
[3530.12 --> 3535.20]  I invite you to stand
[3535.20 --> 3536.62]  And we'll sing
[3536.62 --> 3539.14]  A new hymn
[3539.14 --> 3541.76]  By the Gettys
[3541.76 --> 3543.70]  That speaks exactly
[3543.70 --> 3544.24]  To this
[3544.24 --> 3546.62]  About walking by faith
[3546.62 --> 3547.88]  And how others
[3547.88 --> 3548.86]  Have gone before us
[3548.86 --> 3549.74]  And set an example
[3549.74 --> 3550.66]  That we can follow
[3550.66 --> 3567.10]  By faith we see
[3567.10 --> 3569.48]  The hand of God
[3569.48 --> 3575.14]  In the light of creation's grand design
[3575.14 --> 3579.84]  In the lives of those
[3579.84 --> 3583.72]  Who preach his faithfulness
[3583.72 --> 3586.06]  Who are not by faith
[3586.06 --> 3588.88]  And not by sight
[3588.88 --> 3593.54]  By faith our Father's wrong
[3593.54 --> 3617.86]  We will stand as children
[3617.86 --> 3627.34]  From the Lord
[3627.34 --> 3627.70]  On the MOJive
[3627.70 --> 3628.68]  Till the Lord
[3628.68 --> 3629.82]  And none of these
[3629.82 --> 3638.84]  We will give
[3638.84 --> 3645.28]  I faith the promise all the day
[3645.28 --> 3651.54]  With the long-for-sire of the week
[3651.54 --> 3659.26]  With the power to break the chains of fear and death
[3659.26 --> 3663.60]  And rise high up in trouble and pain
[3663.60 --> 3670.36]  I faith the church was called to go
[3670.36 --> 3677.82]  In the power of the spirit of the lost
[3677.82 --> 3684.44]  In the river, the compass and the future moves
[3684.44 --> 3689.48]  For every corner of the earth
[3689.48 --> 3695.24]  We will stand as children of the present
[3695.24 --> 3702.20]  We will fix our lives on Him, our soul brings work
[3702.20 --> 3709.24]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3709.24 --> 3714.00]  We will walk by faith and love by sight
[3714.00 --> 3720.00]  My faith this mountain shall prevail
[3720.00 --> 3726.42]  And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[3726.42 --> 3732.78]  For we know in Christ all things impossible
[3732.78 --> 3738.54]  We will walk by faith and love by sight
[3738.54 --> 3744.54]  We will stand as children of the present
[3744.54 --> 3751.54]  We will fix our lives on Him, our souls be born
[3751.54 --> 3758.54]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3758.54 --> 3764.30]  We will make our faith and love by sight
[3764.30 --> 3769.30]  We will stand as children of the present
[3769.30 --> 3776.30]  We will fix our lives on Him, our souls be born
[3776.30 --> 3783.30]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3783.30 --> 3789.06]  We will make our faith and love by sight
[3789.06 --> 3791.06]  We may be seen
[3791.06 --> 3804.60]  It's always challenging learning a new song
[3804.60 --> 3805.90]  But I think it's a good one
[3805.90 --> 3808.02]  And it's based right on Hebrews chapter 11
[3808.02 --> 3809.80]  So we'll keep trying to learn it together
[3809.80 --> 3814.16]  We continue now in this time of our service
[3814.16 --> 3817.30]  To worship the Lord in the giving of our offerings to Him
[3817.30 --> 3822.18]  And that is not to reconcile us with God
[3822.18 --> 3828.38]  Not to, you know, cover our own sins
[3828.38 --> 3831.96]  But it's actually a response to God
[3831.96 --> 3834.06]  Who by His grace covered our sins
[3834.06 --> 3837.22]  And so we give freely by His grace
[3837.22 --> 3839.76]  And our designated offering for today
[3839.76 --> 3841.94]  Is for our local church ministries
[3841.94 --> 3845.78]  And John kind of said what some of those are
[3845.78 --> 3847.32]  And that we're all familiar with
[3847.32 --> 3849.42]  But we give to that today
[3849.42 --> 3852.04]  And may I invite our deacons to come forward
[3852.04 --> 3852.88]  To collect the offering
[3852.88 --> 3870.20]  That we have a invitation
[3870.20 --> 3872.66]  So we'll be Bien one day
[3872.66 --> 3874.66]  Amen.
[3902.66 --> 3904.66]  Amen.
[3932.66 --> 3934.66]  Amen.
[3962.66 --> 3964.66]  Amen.
[3992.66 --> 3994.66]  Amen.
[4022.66 --> 4024.66]  Amen.
[4038.66 --> 4040.04]  Very beautiful.
[4043.04 --> 4049.92]  So let's now bow our heads together, bow our hearts, and pray together to the Lord.
[4052.66 --> 4066.48]  The Psalms say, give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name, make known among the nations what
[4066.48 --> 4067.42]  he has done.
[4068.76 --> 4076.22]  Sing to him, sing praise to him, tell of all his wonderful acts, glory in his holy name.
[4076.22 --> 4080.28]  Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
[4080.28 --> 4083.28]  Look to the Lord in his strength.
[4084.12 --> 4086.54]  Seek his face always.
[4088.56 --> 4094.82]  Our Heavenly Father, we praise you for your deep and unfailing love for us, your children.
[4095.78 --> 4102.80]  Thank you, Lord, that your mercies to us are new every morning, and that through the sacrifice
[4102.80 --> 4108.48]  of your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, we have received the immeasurable gift of grace.
[4109.48 --> 4115.34]  And we are grateful, Lord, for the Holy Spirit who opens our eyes and who softens our hearts
[4115.34 --> 4120.20]  to understand and to cherish this great salvation.
[4120.20 --> 4131.00]  Lord, as your humble servants, help us to live lives worthy of your calling, to reflect your love to all whom we encounter each day.
[4132.00 --> 4141.22]  Lord, this morning we give, as we give for the ministries of our church, Lord, we take the opportunity to pray for our church.
[4141.22 --> 4150.28]  Lord, we thank you that you provide spiritual leaders, elders and deacons who encourage us and build us up in our faith.
[4151.32 --> 4157.86]  Lord, strengthen our church leaders, our council, as they discern the needs of our church family and serve with wisdom.
[4157.86 --> 4166.56]  We ask, Lord, for your leading in all of our ministries and for clarity and direction as we seek to walk with you as a church.
[4167.14 --> 4171.94]  We pray, Lord, for all those who serve in Sunday school, our teachers and helpers.
[4172.54 --> 4180.40]  We pray for those who serve in GEMS and Cadets, in the Friendship Coffeehouse and ESL, and in worship and music,
[4180.94 --> 4185.00]  in building maintenance and sound and media, our Chinese ministry.
[4185.00 --> 4193.74]  And Lord, would you encourage and strengthen all who serve, and Lord, bless them in their ministry.
[4195.02 --> 4202.08]  And Jesus, we praise you because you are the true cornerstone and firm foundation of our church.
[4202.98 --> 4210.22]  We thank you for our visit that we had this past Wednesday night with Jenna and Martin from Willoughby Church,
[4210.22 --> 4217.80]  who came and asked us some good questions and how we were able to encourage one another.
[4217.96 --> 4221.26]  Lord, and we ask that you would bless their church as well.
[4221.78 --> 4229.72]  Lord, bless their ministries, provide for their needs, especially as they search for a worship director to help them in their music ministry.
[4229.72 --> 4239.10]  Father, we pray for the global church, especially, Lord, as we witness darkness, conflict, and division in the world.
[4239.82 --> 4246.08]  Lord, we ask that you would sustain our brothers and sisters who proclaim the gospel in dangerous and hostile places.
[4246.76 --> 4250.08]  We especially remember the suffering church in northern Nigeria.
[4251.10 --> 4254.32]  Lord, by your sovereign power, restrain those who persecute your people.
[4254.32 --> 4262.70]  Help those believers to stand firm, remembering that those who live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution,
[4263.52 --> 4268.14]  and that those who suffer for righteousness are blessed, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[4269.18 --> 4273.04]  We thank you, Lord, for the spiritual armor that you provide for us,
[4273.22 --> 4277.96]  so that we can stand steadfast, prepared for every spiritual battle.
[4280.78 --> 4283.54]  Lord, we pray for the churches in Ladner.
[4284.32 --> 4286.86]  That remain faithful to the gospel.
[4288.00 --> 4292.02]  That proclaim the person and the work of Jesus Christ.
[4292.92 --> 4296.08]  Lord, we pray that they would be places of welcome and hope and truth.
[4296.46 --> 4298.72]  And especially, Lord, as Christmas approaches,
[4300.26 --> 4305.48]  may those who are searching for meaning be drawn to Christ.
[4305.96 --> 4307.48]  And may they encounter your grace.
[4308.28 --> 4311.16]  And our Heavenly Father, we lift up the needs within our own church family.
[4311.16 --> 4316.84]  Lord, for those facing difficulties in their health, finances, or relationships,
[4316.84 --> 4319.52]  would you bring comfort, healing, and strength.
[4320.00 --> 4328.08]  Lord, we pray for Doug Rideout this week as he was in the hospital over the past weekend.
[4328.20 --> 4330.28]  We thank you that he's out of the hospital.
[4330.28 --> 4332.12]  Lord, we continue to be with him.
[4332.84 --> 4338.10]  Continue to be with Mel and Shirley as they continue to recover.
[4338.76 --> 4341.32]  Lord, we thank you that Mel is here with us this morning.
[4342.12 --> 4350.42]  Continue to be with Sean Limus as he is back home and is still undergoing the treatments for Lyme disease.
[4350.56 --> 4352.22]  Lord, would you bring him to full health.
[4352.22 --> 4356.60]  And Lord, for the many others as well, Lord, who need your care.
[4357.02 --> 4362.24]  Keep us all, Lord, from getting too sick this cold season,
[4362.46 --> 4366.30]  so that we may continue, Lord, to serve you with the strength that you provide.
[4366.72 --> 4371.56]  And Lord, for all of us, open our eyes more and more to the needs of all those around us.
[4371.80 --> 4376.94]  And give each of us your wisdom, your compassion, and courage to love as you have loved us.
[4376.94 --> 4384.68]  Finally, Father, we pray for the peace and the joy of your very presence to be with each one of us.
[4385.24 --> 4389.02]  For the hope of resurrection and life in the world to come.
[4389.68 --> 4392.24]  We pray all these things in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[4392.88 --> 4393.18]  Amen.
[4395.04 --> 4400.98]  Let's stand and we'll conclude our time of worship as God sends us out.
[4400.98 --> 4407.08]  A quick note for those who are joining the Make Up Sunday School Teacher Helper Meeting with me
[4407.08 --> 4410.98]  will be in the council room right after the service.
[4412.84 --> 4419.60]  And I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4420.76 --> 4425.62]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[4425.62 --> 4430.52]  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.
[4430.98 --> 4434.70]  And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
[4434.84 --> 4439.64]  fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[4440.20 --> 4440.48]  Amen.
[4440.48 --> 4440.54]  Amen.
[4460.98 --> 4469.08]  May the grace of Christ the risen Son and the fellowship of God, our heavenly Father,
[4469.08 --> 4485.98]  and the grace of Christ the risen Son, and the fellowship of God, the Spirit, keep our heart and mind within His blood.
[4485.98 --> 4492.90]  And to Him be praised for His glorious grace.
[4492.90 --> 4498.72]  From the depths of earth to the heights of heaven,
[4498.94 --> 4504.68]  we declare the name of the Lamb of Satan,
[4504.68 --> 4509.46]  Christ eternal, the King of kings.
[4509.46 --> 4521.22]  near the space
[4521.22 --> 4522.26]  which passes
[4522.26 --> 4526.92]  and the praise
[4526.92 --> 4530.46]  which makes us what we are
[4530.46 --> 4533.14]  and his fellowship
[4533.14 --> 4535.62]  on his communion
[4535.62 --> 4538.38]  make us one
[4538.38 --> 4542.22]  in spirit and in heart
[4542.22 --> 4545.02]  and to him be the grace
[4545.02 --> 4547.82]  for his glorious reign
[4547.82 --> 4550.54]  from the depths of earth
[4550.54 --> 4553.58]  to the heights of heaven
[4553.58 --> 4556.38]  we declare the name
[4556.38 --> 4559.18]  of the lamb of sin
[4559.18 --> 4561.02]  christ eternal
[4561.02 --> 4565.02]  the king of kings
[4565.02 --> 4566.62]  christ eternal
[4566.62 --> 4571.66]  the king of kings
[4571.66 --> 4582.30]  jesus
[4582.30 --> 4584.30]  the king of kings
[4584.30 --> 4590.78]  of the kings
[4590.78 --> 4592.94]  for the first time
[4592.94 --> 4622.92]  Thank you.
[4622.94 --> 4652.92]  Thank you.
[4652.94 --> 4654.94]  Thank you.
