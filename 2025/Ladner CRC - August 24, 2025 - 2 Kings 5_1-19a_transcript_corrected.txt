[0.00 → 29.98] Let's pray.
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[300.00 → 302.00] Amen.
[330.00 → 332.00] Amen.
[360.00 → 363.38] Good morning.
[363.38 → 364.38] Good morning.
[364.38 → 368.66] Welcome on this beautiful, sunny summer morning.
[368.66 → 380.28] We are not big, but we are here to worship our great God, and he says where
[380.28 → 384.36] two or three, and there's many more than two or three here, where two or three are gathered
[384.36 → 387.32] in his name, he is here in the midst of us.
[387.32 → 391.82] So let's remember that as we worship him this morning.
[391.82 → 396.64] I'd like to welcome everyone here, whether you're here, whether you're with us online,
[396.64 → 399.44] whether you're a guest, welcome here.
[399.44 → 408.78] And also a special welcome to Pastor Ajee Imran, who is here actually a long ways from Egypt.
[408.78 → 409.78] He's going back.
[409.78 → 411.78] You're going back tonight, right?
[411.78 → 412.78] In a week.
[412.78 → 415.36] You have a conference first, right?
[415.36 → 420.18] And so he's going to bring God's message to us today.
[420.18 → 426.18] And he just told me that it was his and Anne's 25th wedding anniversary on Thursday.
[426.18 → 433.28] God bless you for at least another 25, I say.
[433.28 → 442.46] So Ajee and his wife Anne engage in all kinds of opportunities in Egypt to develop leaders
[442.46 → 448.46] and disciples of the gospel, not only among the Egyptian Muslim population, but taking
[448.46 → 452.46] opportunities that come from many neighbouring nations, from what I understand.
[452.46 → 458.64] So God is giving them many opportunities there, and we support them and are so happy to have
[458.64 → 460.46] you here this morning, Ajee.
[460.46 → 467.46] I'm going to ask you if you're able to please rise for our call to worship this morning.
[467.46 → 473.56] It's responsive, and you'll see it on the screen where there are two arrows is where you respond.
[473.56 → 480.56] O God, my God, earnestly I seek you.
[480.56 → 482.56] My soul thirsts for you.
[482.56 → 489.72] My body longs for you in a dry and weird land where there is no water.
[489.72 → 494.72] I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
[494.72 → 500.72] Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
[500.72 → 507.72] I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift my hands.
[507.72 → 509.72] Will you pray with me?
[509.72 → 516.72] God of heaven and earth, you are infinitely creative, infinitely kind, and merciful.
[516.72 → 521.72] You lavish your care and love on us, your children.
[521.72 → 526.72] We adore you, for you are just, true, and worthy of all praise.
[526.72 → 529.72] Accept our worship of you this morning.
[529.72 → 532.72] May we adore you with undivided hearts.
[532.72 → 534.72] Amen.
[534.72 → 537.72] Our greeting this morning from God comes from Jude 2.
[537.72 → 542.72] Mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[542.72 → 545.72] And as God greets us, let's also greet one another this morning.
[545.72 → 547.72] That's for good care of you.

[562.72 → 565.72] 49
[569.72 → 572.72] Army
[572.72 → 602.70] Thank you.
[602.72 → 606.26] God is great. Let's sing with great voices to him.
[632.72 → 642.12] We sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day.
[642.62 → 649.60] The moon shines full at his command and all the stars obey.
[649.60 → 659.60] We sing the goodness of the Lord that filled the earth with food.
[660.60 → 667.86] He formed the creatures with his word and then pronounced them good.
[667.86 → 676.58] Lord, how old wonders are displayed where'er we turn our eyes.
[676.78 → 684.44] If we survey the ground, we tremble or gaze upon the sky.
[684.44 → 694.84] There's not a plant or flower below, but makes your glories known.
[695.50 → 702.88] And clouds arise and tempests flow by order from your throne.
[702.88 → 710.88] While all that borrows life from you is ever in your care.
[711.82 → 719.88] And everywhere that we can be, you've got our present there.
[719.88 → 747.08] My soul longs for the Lord in a weary land.
[747.08 → 755.04] Wells are dry, and I am empty, only dust in my hands.
[755.38 → 762.88] How I yearn for screams of mercy, where my soul can be restored.
[763.64 → 764.80] Come and pray.
[764.80 → 771.22] Jesus calls me, and you will thirst no more.
[771.22 → 775.10] Oh, the fullness of Christ.
[775.10 → 779.06] Word of God, Word of God.
[783.44 → 792.02] How often in the stillness have I heard your voice.
[792.02 → 799.88] Every whisper, every promise, calls my heart to rejoice.
[799.88 → 807.86] In the quiet of the morning, through the watches of the night.
[807.86 → 815.72] In the fire of my struggles, there's courage for the heart.
[815.72 → 819.72] Oh, the power of Christ.
[819.72 → 823.72] Word of God, Word of God.
[829.72 → 833.32] My soul longs to walk closer.
[833.32 → 836.92] With the Lord I serve.
[836.92 → 841.00] More than riches, more than favour.
[841.42 → 845.06] I delight in your word.
[845.06 → 849.10] Turn my gaze from all that's worthless.
[849.10 → 853.14] Set my heart on things above.
[853.14 → 857.52] May my life tell your goodness.
[857.52 → 861.38] Your way of truth and love.
[861.38 → 865.36] Oh, the wisdom of Christ.
[865.84 → 869.06] Word of God, Word of life.
[872.34 → 873.86] You may be seated.
[875.06 → 876.16] Amen.
[876.16 → 876.64] Amen.
[876.64 → 876.88] Amen.
[876.88 → 876.96] Amen.
[876.96 → 877.52] Amen.
[877.52 → 877.96] Amen.
[877.96 → 878.64] Amen.
[878.64 → 879.06] Amen.
[879.06 → 879.08] Amen.
[879.08 → 879.14] Amen.
[879.14 → 879.18] Amen.
[879.18 → 880.02] Amen.
[880.02 → 881.24] Amen.
[885.30 → 889.14] Amen.
[889.14 → 895.48] Our scripture reading this morning is from Isaiah 55, verse 1 through 7.
[895.96 → 902.38] If you'd like to follow along in your pew Bible, that can be found on page 553.
[902.38 → 908.56] Isaiah 55 verse 1 through 7.
[908.56 → 917.96] Come all you who are thirsty, come to the waters, and you who have no money, come, buy and eat.
[918.82 → 923.68] Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
[924.46 → 929.92] Why spend money on what is not bread and your labour on what does not satisfy?
[929.92 → 937.94] Listen, listen to me and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest affair.
[938.68 → 940.54] Give ear and come to me.
[941.48 → 943.08] Listen that you may live.
[943.94 → 949.72] I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David.
[950.64 → 956.00] See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a ruler and commander of peoples.
[956.00 → 964.62] Surely you will summon nations you not know, and nations you do not know will come running to you
[964.62 → 972.22] because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendour.
[973.48 → 975.92] Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[976.58 → 978.80] Call on him while he is near.
[978.80 → 984.66] Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[985.38 → 989.36] Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them.
[989.94 → 993.20] And to our God, for he will freely pardon.
[993.82 → 995.32] This is the word of the Lord.
[995.32 → 997.18] Thanks be to God.
[1001.26 → 1011.54] That invitation to seek the Lord, to call on him, and to turn to him for mercy
[1011.54 → 1017.10] is why we have the tradition of confessing our sins every Sunday morning here in this church.
[1018.20 → 1022.66] 1 John 1, verse 5 to 7 explains why we do this.
[1022.66 → 1052.64] It says,
[1052.66 → 1058.34] Let us pray.
[1058.34 → 1058.36] Let us pray.
[1075.36 → 1078.14] Please join me in a prayer of response.
[1078.14 → 1086.76] Awesome and compassionate God, you have loved us with unfailing, self-giving mercy,
[1087.56 → 1089.90] but we have not loved you.
[1090.90 → 1095.44] You constantly call us, but we do not listen.
[1095.44 → 1104.16] You ask us to love, but we walk away from neighbours in need, wrapped in our own concerns.
[1105.12 → 1110.70] We condone evil, prejudice, warfare, and greed.
[1110.70 → 1115.80] God of grace, as you come to us in mercy.
[1115.80 → 1119.18] We repent in spirit and in truth.
[1119.48 → 1123.96] Admit our sins, and gratefully receive your forgiveness.
[1124.64 → 1127.04] Through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.
[1127.64 → 1127.98] Amen.
[1127.98 → 1128.08] Amen.
[1129.28 → 1131.52] And that is very good news.
[1131.62 → 1134.48] Let's rise and sing a few songs of praise to God.
[1134.48 → 1136.54] Amen.
[1144.20 → 1144.86] Amen.
[1144.86 → 1145.46] Amen.
[1145.46 → 1167.82] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1167.82 → 1180.44] I dare not trust the sweetest grain, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1182.06 → 1192.30] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1192.30 → 1205.30] I dare not trust the sweetest grain, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1205.30 → 1220.30] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1220.96 → 1229.30] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1229.30 → 1247.00] When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[1247.00 → 1258.00] In every night and stormy game, my anchor holds within the veil.
[1260.14 → 1265.00] My anchor holds within the veil.
[1265.00 → 1279.00] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1279.00 → 1289.00] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1289.00 → 1305.00] When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may our men in Him be found.
[1305.00 → 1317.00] Rest in His righteousness alone, faultless stand before the throne.
[1317.00 → 1331.00] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1331.00 → 1341.00] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1341.00 → 1356.00] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1356.00 → 1366.00] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1366.00 → 1368.00] Lord of all.
[1368.00 → 1373.00] Lord of all.
[1373.00 → 1375.00] φと祀を chloride work.

[1400.62 → 1410.16] I'm a little bit stronger to touch your heart and glorify your name.
[1410.16 → 1416.48] Your name is a strong mighty tower.
[1416.76 → 1422.26] Your name is a shelter like your mother.
[1422.26 → 1452.24] Your name is a shelter like your mother.

[1511.26 → 1511.28] Your name is a shelter like your mother.
[1511.28 → 1513.28] Your name is a shelter like no other.
[1513.28 → 1518.28] Your name is a shelter like no other."
[1518.28 → 1547.28] We just have a presentation that will take place before the children leave.
[1547.28 → 1552.28] I'd ask Edda, Edda Young, please come forward.
[1552.28 → 1562.28] Over the past summer months, all of July and August, Edda has joined us and been our Sunday school teacher.
[1562.28 → 1571.28] She volunteered to do that, and we were, we graciously accepted to give our teachers also some time off during the summer months.
[1571.28 → 1583.28] Edda has just built a wonderful relationship with our kids in the Sunday school, and we know that they've loved her and having her teach them.
[1583.28 → 1589.28] And we hope that it's also been a perfect experience for you, Edda, for sure.
[1589.28 → 1603.28] On behalf of the congregation and Ladder CRC, we'd like to present Edda just with a card and inside the card is also a small honorarium just to honour you and thank you very much.
[1603.28 → 1612.28] And blessings to you as you go forward, Edda.
[1612.28 → 1625.28] Thank you.
[1625.28 → 1632.28] Yeah, the kids are leaving now and at this time I'm going to call on Pastor Ajee to come up.
[1632.28 → 1634.28] I've already sort of given you an introduction.
[1634.28 → 1637.28] He can give more if I didn't do well enough.
[1637.28 → 1639.28] But welcome, Pastor Ajee.
[1639.28 → 1640.28] Thank you.
[1640.28 → 1644.28] Good morning.
[1644.28 → 1647.28] Greetings from Egypt, from my family.
[1647.28 → 1650.28] Anne and Alex are in Cairo.
[1650.28 → 1654.28] Sebastian, Jonathan, Emmanuel are in Michigan.
[1654.28 → 1658.28] I hope to see them all in the next week and a half.
[1658.28 → 1660.28] This is my last day in Canada.
[1660.28 → 1663.28] I've only been here for a couple of weeks.
[1663.28 → 1671.28] Part of my reason for being here though was kind of to say goodbye to some things.
[1671.28 → 1682.28] I asked Resonate if I could come here instead of just going directly to meetings and dealing with the jet lag in the middle of that.
[1682.28 → 1685.28] They didn't mind me coming a little bit early.
[1685.28 → 1690.28] My family, as you guys know, are in Port Alberti.
[1690.28 → 1695.28] And my dad has just moved to assisted living.
[1695.28 → 1697.28] My mom died about a year and a half ago.
[1697.28 → 1707.28] And so, you know, we're kind of closing up a chapter of life with the home and all the things that that meant.
[1707.28 → 1714.28] So it was good to be a little bit of time with my siblings and take a step together that way.
[1714.28 → 1719.28] So I'd appreciate your continued prayers for all of us.
[1719.28 → 1724.28] And for Resonate this week as we meet as a leadership team.
[1724.28 → 1734.28] As you know, I'm the regional leader for the Middle East, but I'm also this year I've taken on responsibilities related to West Africa as well.
[1734.28 → 1739.28] And that will mean the merging of those two regions.
[1739.28 → 1743.28] And in some way that's a new challenge.
[1743.28 → 1746.28] So lots of things going on in my life.
[1746.28 → 1752.28] And it's really, it's been a gift for me to be here.
[1752.28 → 1761.28] You guys have hosted us many times through the Mantras who, although they aren't here, they've let me stay at their place these last couple of nights.
[1761.28 → 1771.28] So this morning we're going to jump into the Old Testament, but I'm going to take you there through the New Testament.
[1771.28 → 1775.28] Through one of the most famous passages, and I know that you all know it.
[1775.28 → 1783.28] If we go to Luke chapter 4, you'll recognize, probably many of you know where it is.
[1783.28 → 1791.28] The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
[1791.28 → 1801.28] He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour.
[1801.28 → 1809.28] Jesus closes the book and says, today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
[1809.28 → 1811.28] Some of you know where that came from?
[1811.28 → 1815.28] Luke chapter 4.
[1815.28 → 1831.28] Now, what you probably didn't make the connection to is the fact that Jesus goes on and, although everybody has their expectations super high, he says, I don't plan to do anything special for you.
[1831.28 → 1840.28] He says, it's going to be the same as it was in the days of Elijah and Elisha.
[1840.28 → 1848.28] And in verse 27, he says, there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet.
[1848.28 → 1851.28] Yet, not one of them was cleansed.
[1851.28 → 1855.28] Only Norman the Syrian.
[1855.28 → 1858.28] And all the people were furious.
[1858.28 → 1863.28] They wanted some sense that the kingdom was here for them.
[1863.28 → 1870.28] And Jesus said, the kingdom is here for, in some way, the Gentiles first.
[1870.28 → 1873.28] It's interesting.
[1873.28 → 1880.28] Jesus is the one who makes that story of Norman the Syrian famous.
[1880.28 → 1885.28] And that story is in 2 Kings chapter 5.
[1885.28 → 1889.28] Now, we're going to read it, but I, so go ahead and turn there.
[1889.28 → 1891.28] But I'm going to give you a little bit of background there.
[1891.28 → 1897.28] The end of 1 Kings is all about Elijah.
[1897.28 → 1903.28] And then we get to 2 Kings chapter 1, and it's this transition.
[1903.28 → 1913.28] And then chapters 2 through 4, it's like Elisha has taken Elijah's place, but he has to be proved.
[1913.28 → 1919.28] Like, they have to believe that he's really a prophet of the same stature.
[1919.28 → 1925.28] And so, in chapters 2 to 4, we see seven miracles.
[1925.28 → 1937.28] I'm not going to list those all for you, but one of those miracles is, it's got this strange little detail about a little boy that Elisha heals.
[1937.28 → 1942.28] Actually, it seems that he's died, and he is raised from the dead.
[1942.28 → 1947.28] And Elisha, sorry, the text says,
[1947.28 → 1955.28] The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
[1955.28 → 1961.28] You guys maybe have read that, and it's just a weird detail, okay?
[1961.28 → 1970.28] But that little mention of the word seven is sort of cueing people who are listening or reading and saying,
[1970.28 → 1973.28] You know, seven is quite an important number.
[1973.28 → 1977.28] I actually named my sermon this morning,
[1977.28 → 1982.28] Seven Ducks in a Muddy River, okay?
[1982.28 → 1990.28] Not that I'm going to talk about ducks or anything like that, but like, it's a common title for this text.
[1990.28 → 1995.28] Seven is an important number in this text.
[1995.28 → 2001.28] And I want to kind of start by helping you to pay attention to that number.
[2001.28 → 2006.28] It already has happened a couple of times in the book of 2 Kings.
[2006.28 → 2011.28] Seven miracles to prove that Elisha is a real prophet.
[2011.28 → 2013.28] Seven times this little boy sneezes.
[2013.28 → 2018.28] And we're going to hear the word seven a couple more times in the text.
[2018.28 → 2024.28] But I also want you to pay attention to what else appears seven times, okay?
[2024.28 → 2029.28] So, let's just jump right in.
[2029.28 → 2038.28] We're going to read the text from chapter 5, verse 1, all the way through verse 20, okay?
[2038.28 → 2043.28] And I'll pray before we begin.
[2043.28 → 2050.28] Jesus, we know that we need your eyes.
[2050.28 → 2052.28] We need your light.
[2052.28 → 2061.28] We need your spirit to illuminate and to help us to see and to hear and to apply all these words
[2061.28 → 2077.28] and to hear them in a way that actually both comforts us and challenges us and gives us that small touch, that move of God,
[2077.28 → 2082.28] in order for us to take the step that you want us to take this week.
[2082.28 → 2091.28] So, Lord, we commit ourselves to you right now and ask that as we read together, as we listen, as we think together,
[2091.28 → 2097.28] that you would give each one of us the message that you have brought us here for today.
[2097.28 → 2100.28] We pray this for your glory in Jesus' name.
[2100.28 → 2101.28] Amen.
[2102.28 → 2103.28] Amen.
[2103.28 → 2104.28] Amen.
[2104.28 → 2105.28] Amen.
[2105.28 → 2108.28] Amen.
[2108.28 → 2114.28] Now, Name was commander of the army of the king of Arm.
[2114.28 → 2122.28] I'm going to not interrupt too much, but you guys need to hear that Arm is actually Syria,
[2122.28 → 2130.26] Syria like Jesus mentioned name in the Syrian and another little detail about
[2130.26 → 2138.00] Syria and Egypt where I am at that time the kings and the Pharaohs kings of
[2138.00 → 2143.06] Syria the Pharaohs of Egypt they had this thing where they thought of
[2143.06 → 2151.20] themselves as related to the God in Egypt there's like almost that the
[2151.20 → 2158.70] Pharaoh is the representative of God on earth and in Syria it was that the kings
[2158.70 → 2164.10] of Syria you'll find it if you look for it in first and second Kings they're
[2164.10 → 2173.72] named Ben had that Ben means son had that means thunder because the name of the
[2173.72 → 2181.14] God is thunder and in our text at the end of the text we're going to hear the
[2181.14 → 2186.06] name of the God Roman which also means thunder okay just to kind of give you
[2186.06 → 2193.02] a little bit of awareness that this king who name and worked for thought of
[2193.02 → 2203.70] himself as the son of the God of Thunder all right so Norman was a great man in
[2203.70 → 2210.42] sight of his master and highly regarded because through him the Lord had given
[2210.42 → 2219.90] victory to Arm he was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy now bands of raiders
[2219.90 → 2228.06] from Arm had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel and she
[2228.06 → 2235.14] served Norman's wife she said to her mistress if only my master would see the
[2235.14 → 2244.14] prophet who is in Samaria he would cure him of his leprosy Norman went to his
[2244.14 → 2250.50] master and told him what the girl from Israel had said by all means go the king
[2250.50 → 2259.62] of Arm replied I will send a letter to the king of Israel so Norman left running
[2259.62 → 2266.88] doesn't say that, but we read Isaiah 55 verses 1 to 7 earlier, and it said there
[2266.88 → 2275.50] that people who didn't know you would come running to know you Norman left running
[2275.50 → 2287.32] taking with him ten talents of silver six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of
[2287.32 → 2293.50] clothing the letter that he took to the king of Israel read with this letter I am
[2293.50 → 2300.94] sending my servant Norman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy as soon as
[2300.94 → 2306.88] the king of Israel read the letter he tore his robes and said am I God can I kill
[2306.88 → 2312.94] and bring back to life why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of
[2312.94 → 2320.62] his leprosy see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me when Elisha the man of
[2320.62 → 2328.54] God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes he said he sent this message to
[2328.54 → 2338.12] him why have you torn your robes have the man come to me, and he will know that
[2338.12 → 2345.66] there is a prophet in Israel so Norman went with his horses and chariots and
[2345.66 → 2354.70] stopped at the door of Elisha's house Elisha sent a messenger to say to him go wash
[2354.70 → 2360.94] yourself seven times in the Jordan and your flesh will be restored and
[2360.94 → 2371.90] you will be cleansed but Norman went away angry and said I thought that he would
[2371.90 → 2378.22] surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God wave his
[2378.22 → 2384.66] hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy are not a banner and far power the
[2384.66 → 2390.84] rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel couldn't I wash in them
[2390.84 → 2401.22] and be cleansed so he turned and went off in a rage name and servants went to him and
[2401.22 → 2409.26] the Lord and said my father if the prophet had told you to do some great thing would
[2409.26 → 2420.48] you not have done it how much more than when he tells you wash and be cleansed so Norman went
[2420.48 → 2430.08] down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times as the man of God had told him and his flesh was
[2430.08 → 2444.18] restored and became clean like that of a young boy then Norman and all his attendants went back to the man of God
[2444.18 → 2457.86] he stood before him and said now I know is no God in all the world in Israel, so please accept a gift from your servant
[2457.86 → 2471.18] the prophet answered as surely as the Lord lives whom I serve I will not accept a thing and even though Norman urged him
[2471.18 → 2501.16] he refused if you will not say Norman please let me your servant be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other God but the Lord but may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing when my master enters the temple of
[2501.16 → 2515.08] Risen to bow down, and he is leaning on my arm and I have to bow there also when I bow down in the temple of Risen may the Lord forgive your servant for this
[2515.08 → 2520.38] go in peace Elisha said
[2520.38 → 2524.16] after Norman had travelled
[2524.16 → 2526.16] some distance
[2526.16 → 2531.36] Ghazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said to himself
[2531.36 → 2535.20] my master was too easy
[2535.20 → 2536.60] on Norman
[2536.60 → 2538.16] this Ara mean
[2538.16 → 2541.42] by not accepting from him what he brought
[2541.42 → 2544.62] as surely as the Lord lives
[2544.62 → 2546.36] I will run after him
[2546.36 → 2548.48] and get something from him
[2548.48 → 2551.88] this is the word of the Lord
[2551.88 → 2557.16] you notice that I added a verse
[2557.16 → 2560.76] and the reason I added that verse is because
[2560.76 → 2563.08] it ties to
[2563.08 → 2565.58] the part of the story that probably you know better
[2565.58 → 2567.62] which is the part about Ghazi
[2567.62 → 2569.08] because it somehow
[2569.08 → 2571.20] draws our attention that
[2571.20 → 2572.76] Ghazi went and
[2572.76 → 2574.84] ended up
[2574.84 → 2578.92] cheating and lying and trying to get something
[2578.92 → 2581.72] for himself and lying some more to
[2581.72 → 2584.20] his master and
[2584.20 → 2586.12] then getting struck with
[2586.12 → 2589.08] the leprosy that God had taken away from Norman
[2589.08 → 2598.88] maybe what we don't notice in that little verse that I read through is that there are two words in there that are very important words
[2598.88 → 2605.12] which are also words that are repeated seven times in this text
[2605.12 → 2608.72] the words are God
[2608.72 → 2610.20] and Lord
[2610.20 → 2615.20] and the two words also appear in together
[2615.20 → 2617.54] in
[2617.54 → 2620.66] Norman's voice
[2620.66 → 2622.64] in verse
[2622.64 → 2624.16] 11
[2624.16 → 2625.84] where he
[2625.84 → 2628.86] refers to Elisha
[2628.86 → 2630.12] and
[2630.12 → 2632.36] he says
[2632.36 → 2639.16] I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord
[2639.16 → 2640.54] his God
[2640.54 → 2642.72] the Lord God
[2642.72 → 2645.14] those two words
[2645.14 → 2647.90] once like that together
[2647.90 → 2648.88] happen
[2648.88 → 2650.60] seven times in this text
[2650.60 → 2653.64] we have a bunch of sevens
[2653.64 → 2654.58] and
[2654.58 → 2656.70] this morning
[2656.70 → 2657.86] I want to
[2657.86 → 2660.82] point out a couple of other hidden sevens
[2660.82 → 2662.34] which you'll see in the text
[2662.34 → 2663.36] if you look for them
[2663.36 → 2665.44] one of them is just
[2665.44 → 2666.60] the characters
[2666.60 → 2667.32] there's seven
[2667.32 → 2669.14] kind of characters
[2669.14 → 2669.82] that we see
[2669.82 → 2670.50] we see Norman
[2670.50 → 2671.10] we see
[2671.10 → 2671.86] the
[2671.86 → 2673.78] king of Syria
[2673.78 → 2676.40] we see
[2676.40 → 2677.74] the king of Israel
[2677.74 → 2679.46] we see this
[2679.46 → 2680.84] little servant girl
[2680.84 → 2682.74] we see Elisha
[2682.74 → 2683.22] and
[2683.22 → 2683.94] Ghazi
[2683.94 → 2685.74] and
[2685.74 → 2686.56] then we see
[2686.56 → 2688.42] like a group of characters
[2688.42 → 2688.96] and I
[2688.96 → 2690.34] I think of them as
[2690.34 → 2691.10] one
[2691.10 → 2692.10] because they have
[2692.10 → 2692.98] one purpose
[2692.98 → 2695.08] they all
[2695.08 → 2696.04] do the same thing
[2696.04 → 2697.64] they all
[2697.64 → 2698.50] are
[2698.50 → 2699.28] carrying
[2699.28 → 2700.22] the message
[2700.22 → 2700.92] to Norman
[2700.92 → 2703.24] of this little servant girl
[2703.24 → 2705.54] because she doesn't talk to him directly
[2705.54 → 2707.64] it's through the
[2707.64 → 2708.98] mistress
[2708.98 → 2709.42] or the
[2709.42 → 2710.48] her master
[2710.48 → 2711.84] who is Norman's wife
[2711.84 → 2712.48] that
[2712.48 → 2714.92] the servant girl's message gets to Norman
[2714.92 → 2716.62] and it's through
[2716.62 → 2718.26] the attendants
[2718.26 → 2720.84] those other people that came with Norman
[2720.84 → 2721.84] that
[2721.84 → 2723.66] the message of God
[2723.66 → 2725.22] from Elisha
[2725.22 → 2728.52] finally comes into Norman's ears
[2728.52 → 2730.44] and I
[2730.44 → 2733.78] I think it's important that we recognize that particular
[2733.78 → 2735.12] group
[2735.12 → 2737.70] when we think about
[2737.70 → 2741.14] what does it look like for a person to come
[2741.14 → 2742.66] to actually hear
[2742.66 → 2743.72] the gospel
[2743.72 → 2747.50] those people
[2747.50 → 2749.74] were not believers
[2749.74 → 2753.68] they were messengers
[2753.68 → 2760.28] they had heard the message that there was a prophet in Israel
[2760.28 → 2763.04] they had heard the message that there could be healing from
[2763.04 → 2765.28] this
[2765.28 → 2766.36] Lord God
[2766.36 → 2768.32] and they
[2768.32 → 2770.00] convinced
[2770.00 → 2771.12] a person
[2771.12 → 2773.34] to listen
[2773.34 → 2774.44] and to believe
[2774.44 → 2775.88] and to trust
[2775.88 → 2776.52] and to take
[2776.52 → 2777.80] concrete steps
[2777.80 → 2779.94] so
[2779.94 → 2781.74] as I reflected on this passage
[2781.74 → 2782.42] I actually thought
[2782.42 → 2783.24] I wonder what
[2783.24 → 2784.70] Elisha was thinking
[2784.70 → 2786.40] not going out
[2786.40 → 2788.18] and meeting with this
[2788.18 → 2789.20] important man
[2789.20 → 2793.56] was he
[2793.56 → 2796.08] what was he doing
[2796.08 → 2799.72] I actually think maybe he was praying
[2799.72 → 2801.10] that the message
[2801.10 → 2802.22] would
[2802.22 → 2804.02] be heard
[2804.02 → 2809.34] I think he didn't want to be
[2809.34 → 2810.96] the focus of
[2810.96 → 2812.08] Norman's attention
[2812.08 → 2814.14] he wanted
[2814.14 → 2815.42] it to be known
[2815.42 → 2816.86] that there was a prophet in Israel
[2816.86 → 2818.04] but more important
[2818.04 → 2819.40] that there was
[2819.40 → 2820.96] the Lord God
[2820.96 → 2821.92] in Israel
[2821.92 → 2824.24] the true God
[2824.24 → 2825.94] above all other gods
[2825.94 → 2829.10] and I think
[2829.10 → 2829.62] maybe
[2829.62 → 2830.18] what
[2830.18 → 2831.50] Elisha was doing
[2831.50 → 2833.88] was just praying
[2833.88 → 2836.70] getting up
[2836.70 → 2838.46] asking God
[2838.46 → 2839.32] to help
[2839.32 → 2840.36] this
[2840.36 → 2841.66] to come through
[2841.66 → 2842.14] to Norman
[2842.14 → 2843.76] and to transform Norman
[2843.76 → 2847.02] so
[2847.02 → 2847.90] transformation
[2847.90 → 2849.22] though
[2849.22 → 2850.26] is really
[2850.26 → 2851.54] where I want to focus
[2851.54 → 2852.32] this morning
[2852.32 → 2853.80] and there are
[2853.80 → 2854.90] seven stages
[2854.90 → 2855.74] in
[2855.74 → 2856.92] Norman's
[2856.92 → 2857.70] transformation
[2857.70 → 2860.26] and
[2860.26 → 2861.62] as we
[2861.62 → 2862.70] listen to these
[2862.70 → 2864.58] as we
[2864.58 → 2865.38] think about these
[2865.38 → 2866.02] I want you to
[2866.02 → 2866.28] maybe
[2866.28 → 2867.12] identify
[2867.12 → 2868.16] where you are
[2868.16 → 2869.20] in that process
[2869.20 → 2870.26] maybe there's a
[2870.26 → 2871.18] place that you
[2871.18 → 2871.84] find yourself
[2871.84 → 2872.16] but
[2872.16 → 2874.60] I want you to
[2874.60 → 2875.00] hold that
[2875.00 → 2875.52] intention
[2875.52 → 2876.28] with the fact
[2876.28 → 2877.56] that we're all
[2877.56 → 2878.22] called
[2878.22 → 2880.36] to be
[2880.36 → 2882.04] sharing the
[2882.04 → 2882.44] message
[2882.44 → 2883.68] and praying
[2883.68 → 2884.82] for that message
[2884.82 → 2885.70] to get through
[2885.70 → 2888.24] we're
[2888.24 → 2889.22] extending
[2889.22 → 2890.60] God's kingdom
[2890.60 → 2892.20] and
[2892.20 → 2893.24] it may be
[2893.24 → 2894.12] indirect
[2894.12 → 2896.82] maybe you guys
[2896.82 → 2897.62] think of yourselves
[2897.62 → 2899.08] as not directly
[2899.08 → 2900.30] involved all the time
[2900.30 → 2901.52] in conveying the
[2901.52 → 2901.90] message
[2901.90 → 2903.10] maybe I'm the
[2903.10 → 2903.44] messenger
[2903.44 → 2904.12] or maybe the
[2904.12 → 2904.80] people I work
[2904.80 → 2905.32] with are the
[2905.32 → 2905.78] messengers
[2905.78 → 2907.22] so there's a
[2907.22 → 2907.94] there's a part
[2907.94 → 2908.56] of this text
[2908.56 → 2909.14] that I want you
[2909.14 → 2909.56] to hear
[2909.56 → 2910.68] and kind
[2910.68 → 2911.18] of take to
[2911.18 → 2911.46] heart
[2911.46 → 2912.66] but there's
[2912.66 → 2913.26] another part
[2913.26 → 2913.86] of this text
[2913.86 → 2914.34] that's about
[2914.34 → 2914.96] your own
[2914.96 → 2915.58] transformation
[2915.58 → 2918.26] and so that's
[2918.26 → 2918.44] where we're
[2918.44 → 2918.72] going to go
[2918.72 → 2919.18] right now
[2919.18 → 2924.66] let's start
[2924.66 → 2925.12] back at the
[2925.12 → 2925.40] beginning
[2925.40 → 2929.26] verse one
[2929.26 → 2930.02] introduces
[2930.02 → 2930.46] Norman
[2930.46 → 2931.96] and introduces
[2931.96 → 2932.70] the fact that
[2932.70 → 2933.32] the Lord
[2933.32 → 2934.06] was the one
[2934.06 → 2934.64] who gave him
[2934.64 → 2934.96] success
[2934.96 → 2935.58] it wasn't
[2935.58 → 2936.10] the God of
[2936.10 → 2936.44] thunder
[2936.44 → 2936.98] it wasn't
[2936.98 → 2937.48] any other
[2937.48 → 2937.78] God
[2937.78 → 2938.30] it was the
[2938.30 → 2938.66] Lord
[2938.66 → 2939.42] who had
[2939.42 → 2940.24] given success
[2940.24 → 2941.28] to Syria
[2941.28 → 2945.50] it
[2945.50 → 2947.16] puts a lot
[2947.16 → 2948.32] of emphasis
[2948.32 → 2949.42] on how
[2949.42 → 2950.54] great a
[2950.54 → 2950.94] man
[2950.94 → 2951.48] Norman
[2951.48 → 2952.16] was
[2952.16 → 2953.98] but what's
[2953.98 → 2954.72] the last
[2954.72 → 2955.28] word
[2955.28 → 2956.62] about
[2956.62 → 2956.96] Norman
[2956.96 → 2958.76] what's the
[2958.76 → 2959.76] final verdict
[2959.76 → 2960.44] on whom
[2960.44 → 2961.02] he is
[2961.02 → 2963.20] but
[2963.20 → 2964.24] he
[2964.24 → 2965.22] had
[2965.22 → 2966.36] leprosy
[2966.36 → 2969.78] this is
[2969.78 → 2970.52] the thing
[2970.52 → 2971.58] that everyone
[2971.58 → 2972.16] in his
[2972.16 → 2972.74] household
[2972.74 → 2973.44] knew
[2973.44 → 2976.12] it was
[2976.12 → 2977.78] a secret
[2977.78 → 2978.64] in plain
[2978.64 → 2979.04] sight
[2979.04 → 2979.48] that he
[2979.48 → 2979.82] never
[2979.82 → 2980.18] wanted
[2980.18 → 2981.10] to hear
[2981.10 → 2981.38] about
[2981.38 → 2983.88] because
[2983.88 → 2985.04] he always
[2985.04 → 2985.36] thought
[2985.36 → 2985.62] about
[2985.62 → 2986.36] it
[2986.36 → 2991.40] are
[2991.40 → 2991.58] there
[2991.58 → 2992.50] things
[2992.50 → 2993.74] in
[2993.74 → 2994.24] your
[2994.24 → 2994.52] own
[2994.52 → 2994.98] life
[2994.98 → 2997.12] that
[2997.12 → 2999.34] you
[2999.34 → 2999.72] kind of
[2999.72 → 2999.98] wish
[2999.98 → 3000.38] weren't
[3000.38 → 3000.72] true
[3000.72 → 3004.22] earlier
[3004.22 → 3004.58] we
[3004.58 → 3005.72] we
[3005.72 → 3006.08] heard
[3006.08 → 3007.04] the
[3007.04 → 3007.30] thing
[3007.30 → 3007.46] that
[3007.46 → 3007.58] we
[3007.58 → 3007.74] do
[3007.74 → 3007.98] every
[3007.98 → 3008.34] week
[3008.34 → 3009.66] we
[3009.66 → 3010.42] confess
[3010.42 → 3010.72] our
[3010.72 → 3011.14] sins
[3011.14 → 3012.40] that's
[3012.40 → 3012.52] an
[3012.52 → 3012.82] important
[3012.82 → 3013.16] thing
[3013.16 → 3013.34] to
[3013.34 → 3013.60] do
[3013.60 → 3015.64] and
[3015.64 → 3015.88] maybe
[3015.88 → 3016.34] the
[3016.34 → 3016.56] thing
[3016.56 → 3016.70] in
[3016.70 → 3016.84] your
[3016.84 → 3017.20] life
[3017.20 → 3018.28] relates
[3018.28 → 3018.48] a
[3018.48 → 3018.60] little
[3018.60 → 3018.78] bit
[3018.78 → 3019.02] to
[3019.02 → 3019.34] that
[3019.34 → 3021.84] but
[3021.84 → 3021.92] I
[3021.92 → 3022.04] want
[3022.04 → 3022.16] to
[3022.16 → 3022.48] call
[3022.48 → 3022.96] that
[3022.96 → 3024.82] one
[3024.82 → 3025.66] category
[3025.66 → 3025.98] of
[3025.98 → 3026.50] poverty
[3026.50 → 3028.98] think
[3028.98 → 3029.24] of it
[3029.24 → 3029.48] as
[3029.48 → 3029.78] like
[3029.78 → 3030.80] ethical
[3030.80 → 3031.40] poverty
[3031.40 → 3032.44] that
[3032.44 → 3033.08] each
[3033.08 → 3033.34] one
[3033.34 → 3033.50] of
[3033.50 → 3033.74] us
[3033.74 → 3034.54] moral
[3034.54 → 3035.04] poverty
[3035.04 → 3035.42] we
[3035.42 → 3035.94] are
[3035.94 → 3037.02] poor
[3037.02 → 3038.34] before
[3038.34 → 3038.74] God
[3038.74 → 3040.76] and
[3040.76 → 3041.32] there
[3041.32 → 3041.50] are
[3041.50 → 3041.86] so
[3041.86 → 3042.12] many
[3042.12 → 3042.42] other
[3042.42 → 3043.20] categories
[3043.20 → 3043.46] though
[3043.46 → 3043.62] of
[3043.62 → 3044.16] poverty
[3044.16 → 3045.18] maybe
[3045.18 → 3045.94] one
[3045.94 → 3046.06] of
[3046.06 → 3046.30] those
[3046.30 → 3046.80] also
[3046.80 → 3047.60] is a
[3047.60 → 3047.84] part
[3047.84 → 3047.98] of
[3047.98 → 3048.12] your

[3050.22 → 3050.38] get
[3050.38 → 3050.58] rid
[3050.58 → 3050.78] of
[3050.78 → 3051.28] and
[3051.28 → 3051.44] you
[3051.44 → 3051.84] hate
[3051.84 → 3052.10] that
[3052.10 → 3052.40] part
[3052.40 → 3052.56] of

[3143.10 → 3143.36] a lot
[3143.36 → 3143.48] of
[3143.48 → 3143.66] other
[3143.66 → 3143.94] ones
[3143.94 → 3144.08] in
[3144.08 → 3144.44] between
[3144.44 → 3144.84] there's
[3144.84 → 3145.20] things
[3145.20 → 3145.58] like
[3145.58 → 3147.06] emotional
[3147.06 → 3147.66] poverty
[3147.66 → 3150.46] psychological
[3150.46 → 3151.42] poverty
[3151.42 → 3152.08] that kind
[3152.08 → 3152.36] of thing
[3152.36 → 3152.54] or
[3152.54 → 3153.60] related
[3153.60 → 3153.98] to that
[3153.98 → 3154.20] maybe
[3154.20 → 3154.76] social
[3154.76 → 3155.30] poverty
[3155.30 → 3158.44] and
[3158.44 → 3159.94] maybe
[3159.94 → 3160.46] there's
[3160.46 → 3161.12] other
[3161.12 → 3161.82] categories
[3161.82 → 3162.72] things
[3162.72 → 3164.10] that
[3164.10 → 3165.04] maybe
[3165.04 → 3165.30] have
[3165.30 → 3165.42] to
[3165.42 → 3165.56] do
[3165.56 → 3165.78] with
[3165.78 → 3166.56] intellectual
[3166.56 → 3167.14] poverty
[3167.14 → 3167.44] not
[3167.44 → 3167.76] having
[3167.76 → 3167.94] the
[3167.94 → 3168.46] education
[3168.46 → 3168.70] you
[3168.70 → 3168.92] need
[3168.92 → 3169.04] in
[3169.04 → 3169.24] order
[3169.24 → 3169.58] to
[3169.58 → 3170.52] feel
[3170.52 → 3170.78] like
[3170.78 → 3171.60] you
[3171.60 → 3171.82] could
[3171.82 → 3171.98] have
[3171.98 → 3172.44] done
[3172.44 → 3172.76] better
[3172.76 → 3173.84] or
[3173.84 → 3174.22] not
[3174.22 → 3174.48] having
[3174.48 → 3174.70] the
[3174.70 → 3175.26] intellectual
[3175.26 → 3175.92] abilities
[3175.92 → 3176.84] that
[3176.84 → 3177.00] you
[3177.00 → 3177.18] wish
[3177.18 → 3177.30] you
[3177.30 → 3177.54] had
[3177.54 → 3178.44] there's
[3178.44 → 3178.78] a lot
[3178.78 → 3178.94] of
[3178.94 → 3179.58] things
[3179.58 → 3180.80] I
[3180.80 → 3180.92] think
[3180.92 → 3181.08] when
[3181.08 → 3181.24] we
[3181.24 → 3181.56] hear
[3181.56 → 3182.44] but
[3182.44 → 3183.68] he
[3183.68 → 3184.20] had
[3184.20 → 3184.84] leprosy
[3184.84 → 3185.38] there's
[3185.38 → 3185.66] a lot
[3185.66 → 3185.86] of
[3185.86 → 3186.40] poverty
[3186.40 → 3186.76] in
[3186.76 → 3186.94] our
[3186.94 → 3187.52] lives
[3187.52 → 3188.34] and
[3188.34 → 3189.00] sometimes
[3189.00 → 3189.98] we
[3189.98 → 3190.28] hate
[3190.28 → 3190.46] to
[3190.46 → 3190.70] admit
[3190.70 → 3191.00] it
[3191.00 → 3191.40] but
[3191.40 → 3191.58] we
[3191.58 → 3191.86] know
[3191.86 → 3192.08] it
[3192.08 → 3193.14] it's
[3193.14 → 3193.42] still
[3193.42 → 3193.96] something
[3193.96 → 3194.28] that
[3194.28 → 3194.64] has
[3194.64 → 3196.04] traumatized
[3196.04 → 3196.52] us
[3196.52 → 3196.90] and
[3196.90 → 3198.02] continues
[3198.02 → 3198.56] to have
[3198.56 → 3198.98] like a
[3198.98 → 3199.42] hold
[3199.42 → 3200.18] on us
[3200.18 → 3202.02] it's
[3202.02 → 3202.30] like a
[3202.30 → 3202.94] disease
[3202.94 → 3207.28] recently
[3207.28 → 3208.38] I was
[3208.38 → 3208.70] also
[3208.70 → 3209.10] listening
[3209.10 → 3209.80] to a
[3209.80 → 3212.16] video
[3212.16 → 3213.02] I don't
[3213.02 → 3213.24] know if
[3213.24 → 3213.64] you guys
[3213.64 → 3215.18] remember
[3215.18 → 3215.48] but
[3215.48 → 3216.12] in
[3216.12 → 3216.90] a newsletter
[3216.90 → 3217.40] recently
[3217.40 → 3218.60] less than
[3218.60 → 3218.80] a year
[3218.80 → 3219.00] ago
[3219.00 → 3219.88] I wrote
[3219.88 → 3220.20] something
[3220.20 → 3220.76] about how
[3220.76 → 3221.18] Ann and
[3221.18 → 3221.48] I had
[3221.48 → 3221.98] gone to
[3221.98 → 3222.34] South
[3222.34 → 3222.74] Korea
[3222.74 → 3223.52] and we
[3223.52 → 3223.72] had
[3223.72 → 3224.88] participated
[3224.88 → 3225.90] in a
[3225.90 → 3226.46] conference
[3226.46 → 3227.22] that was
[3227.22 → 3227.50] called
[3227.50 → 3228.10] Lausanne
[3228.10 → 3229.14] the
[3229.14 → 3229.62] Lausanne
[3229.62 → 3230.86] gathering
[3230.86 → 3231.16] let's
[3231.16 → 3231.46] call it
[3231.46 → 3231.72] there's
[3231.72 → 3231.86] been
[3231.86 → 3232.38] four of
[3232.38 → 3232.66] these
[3232.66 → 3233.02] in the
[3233.02 → 3233.22] last
[3233.22 → 3233.70] like 50
[3233.70 → 3234.04] years
[3234.04 → 3235.04] and
[3235.04 → 3237.24] Lausanne
[3237.24 → 3237.74] puts out
[3237.74 → 3238.02] a lot
[3238.02 → 3238.60] of resources
[3238.60 → 3239.06] one of
[3239.06 → 3239.24] those
[3239.24 → 3239.70] resources
[3239.70 → 3240.34] has to
[3240.34 → 3240.62] do
[3240.62 → 3241.50] just
[3241.50 → 3241.90] recently
[3241.90 → 3242.12] they
[3242.12 → 3242.32] made
[3242.32 → 3242.48] a
[3242.48 → 3242.82] video
[3242.82 → 3243.64] and
[3243.64 → 3243.74] they
[3243.74 → 3243.86] had
[3243.86 → 3244.02] a
[3244.02 → 3244.40] panel
[3244.40 → 3244.62] of
[3244.62 → 3245.02] people
[3245.02 → 3245.56] talking
[3245.56 → 3245.82] about
[3245.82 → 3245.98] the
[3245.98 → 3246.22] different
[3246.22 → 3246.72] types
[3246.72 → 3246.90] of
[3246.90 → 3247.42] poverty
[3247.42 → 3247.78] or
[3247.78 → 3247.98] sorry
[3247.98 → 3248.70] different
[3248.70 → 3249.00] types
[3249.00 → 3249.18] of
[3249.18 → 3249.82] disability
[3249.82 → 3253.40] and
[3253.40 → 3254.30] different
[3254.30 → 3255.10] ways in
[3255.10 → 3255.66] which people
[3255.66 → 3256.40] experience
[3256.40 → 3257.04] disability
[3257.04 → 3258.00] again
[3258.00 → 3259.24] there's a
[3259.24 → 3259.54] lot
[3259.54 → 3259.98] there's not
[3259.98 → 3260.38] just like
[3260.38 → 3260.62] one
[3260.62 → 3260.96] there's
[3260.96 → 3261.62] obviously
[3261.62 → 3262.36] things like
[3262.36 → 3262.84] you know
[3262.84 → 3263.78] blindness
[3263.78 → 3265.16] or you know
[3265.16 → 3266.22] Jesus is talking
[3266.22 → 3266.68] about some
[3266.68 → 3267.06] of that
[3267.06 → 3267.98] the lame
[3267.98 → 3269.14] and the
[3269.14 → 3269.56] blind
[3269.56 → 3270.74] the deaf
[3270.74 → 3271.64] but
[3271.64 → 3273.20] we also
[3273.20 → 3274.04] can see
[3274.04 → 3274.76] that there's
[3274.76 → 3276.00] other kinds
[3276.00 → 3276.74] of disability
[3276.74 → 3277.14] that
[3277.14 → 3277.84] really
[3277.84 → 3278.90] are
[3278.90 → 3279.68] painful
[3279.68 → 3281.66] and
[3281.66 → 3281.92] maybe
[3281.92 → 3282.50] are less
[3282.50 → 3282.96] visible
[3282.96 → 3284.16] developmental
[3284.16 → 3285.64] disabilities
[3285.64 → 3287.12] I mentioned
[3287.12 → 3287.98] intellectual
[3287.98 → 3288.74] poverty
[3288.74 → 3289.46] intellectual
[3289.46 → 3290.18] disability
[3290.18 → 3292.10] I mentioned
[3292.10 → 3293.04] emotional
[3293.04 → 3293.78] poverty
[3293.78 → 3294.84] there's
[3294.84 → 3296.00] psychological
[3296.00 → 3296.88] invisible
[3296.88 → 3297.70] disabilities
[3297.70 → 3298.26] that
[3298.26 → 3299.60] make us
[3299.60 → 3301.82] difficult
[3301.82 → 3302.40] people
[3302.40 → 3304.50] maybe
[3304.50 → 3304.76] you
[3304.76 → 3305.34] have
[3305.34 → 3305.56] a
[3305.56 → 3305.96] difficult
[3305.96 → 3306.56] person
[3306.56 → 3307.50] inside
[3307.50 → 3307.70] of
[3307.70 → 3307.92] you
[3307.92 → 3309.92] or
[3309.92 → 3310.34] in
[3310.34 → 3310.50] your
[3310.50 → 3310.90] family
[3310.90 → 3312.72] and
[3312.72 → 3313.00] this
[3313.00 → 3313.22] has
[3313.22 → 3313.46] been
[3313.46 → 3313.70] the
[3313.70 → 3314.06] thing
[3314.06 → 3315.20] that
[3315.20 → 3315.60] no
[3315.60 → 3315.82] matter
[3315.82 → 3316.30] how
[3316.30 → 3317.00] successful
[3317.00 → 3317.32] your
[3317.32 → 3317.58] life
[3317.58 → 3317.78] has
[3317.78 → 3318.12] been
[3318.12 → 3319.46] it's
[3319.46 → 3319.74] still
[3319.74 → 3320.18] there
[3320.18 → 3321.50] but
[3321.50 → 3323.56] this
[3323.56 → 3323.88] is
[3323.88 → 3325.22] this
[3325.22 → 3325.40] is
[3325.40 → 3325.58] the
[3325.58 → 3325.94] thing
[3325.94 → 3326.44] that
[3326.44 → 3327.58] defines
[3327.58 → 3332.36] that
[3332.36 → 3332.76] first
[3332.76 → 3333.38] verse
[3333.38 → 3335.20] draws
[3335.20 → 3335.44] the
[3335.44 → 3335.92] contrast
[3335.92 → 3336.60] between
[3336.60 → 3337.30] Norman's
[3337.30 → 3337.86] success
[3337.86 → 3338.58] and his
[3338.58 → 3339.08] core
[3339.08 → 3339.82] identity
[3339.82 → 3341.68] and
[3341.68 → 3341.88] that
[3341.88 → 3342.32] core
[3342.32 → 3342.96] identity
[3342.96 → 3344.16] was
[3344.16 → 3344.56] something
[3344.56 → 3345.16] that he
[3345.16 → 3345.76] had
[3345.76 → 3346.24] never
[3346.24 → 3346.98] experienced
[3346.98 → 3348.30] healing
[3348.30 → 3348.66] in
[3348.66 → 3350.08] so
[3350.08 → 3350.50] when he
[3350.50 → 3351.06] heard
[3351.06 → 3351.44] the
[3351.44 → 3352.10] possibility
[3352.10 → 3352.94] of being
[3352.94 → 3353.42] healed
[3353.42 → 3355.26] he
[3355.26 → 3355.68] ran
[3355.68 → 3357.90] he
[3357.90 → 3358.40] collected
[3358.40 → 3359.58] a
[3359.58 → 3360.42] lifetime's
[3360.42 → 3360.60] worth
[3360.60 → 3360.80] of
[3360.80 → 3361.24] savings
[3361.24 → 3362.38] this
[3362.38 → 3364.32] the gold
[3364.32 → 3364.80] and silver
[3364.80 → 3365.82] just those
[3365.82 → 3366.82] probably
[3366.82 → 3367.44] today
[3367.44 → 3368.00] would be
[3368.00 → 3368.72] worth
[3368.72 → 3369.44] six million
[3369.44 → 3369.94] dollars
[3369.94 → 3373.04] and
[3373.04 → 3373.18] he
[3373.18 → 3373.74] took it
[3373.74 → 3375.68] with the
[3375.68 → 3376.00] goal
[3376.00 → 3376.72] that he
[3376.72 → 3377.18] would get
[3377.18 → 3377.56] healed
[3377.56 → 3381.60] but
[3381.60 → 3381.86] what I
[3381.86 → 3382.18] want you
[3382.18 → 3382.56] to see
[3382.56 → 3383.14] in his
[3383.14 → 3383.74] transformation
[3383.74 → 3384.56] was that
[3384.56 → 3385.16] he moved
[3385.16 → 3385.66] from a
[3385.66 → 3386.22] place of
[3386.22 → 3387.06] entitlement
[3387.06 → 3389.54] a sense
[3389.54 → 3390.32] that he
[3390.32 → 3391.64] could get
[3391.64 → 3392.06] what he
[3392.06 → 3392.40] wanted
[3392.40 → 3393.16] by paying
[3393.16 → 3394.46] for it
[3394.46 → 3395.88] of
[3395.88 → 3397.48] entrancement
[3397.48 → 3400.32] where
[3400.32 → 3402.12] he
[3402.12 → 3403.90] no longer
[3403.90 → 3404.78] saw
[3404.78 → 3405.64] himself
[3405.64 → 3406.78] fully
[3406.78 → 3407.40] focused
[3407.40 → 3407.82] on
[3407.82 → 3408.18] God
[3408.18 → 3413.14] there are
[3413.14 → 3413.48] seven
[3413.48 → 3413.92] stages
[3413.92 → 3414.28] we'll go
[3414.28 → 3414.78] through them
[3414.78 → 3415.60] pretty quickly
[3415.60 → 3417.22] and I
[3417.22 → 3417.66] think you'll
[3417.66 → 3418.02] be able to
[3418.02 → 3418.36] see them
[3418.36 → 3418.66] in the
[3418.66 → 3418.92] text
[3418.92 → 3419.22] when I
[3419.22 → 3419.68] point
[3419.68 → 3419.84] them
[3419.84 → 3420.04] out
[3420.04 → 3422.30] the
[3422.30 → 3422.60] first
[3422.60 → 3422.86] thing
[3422.86 → 3423.06] that
[3423.06 → 3423.42] happens
[3423.42 → 3423.66] to
[3423.66 → 3423.94] Norman
[3423.94 → 3425.22] is
[3425.22 → 3426.56] he
[3426.56 → 3427.42] is
[3427.42 → 3427.92] humbled
[3427.92 → 3432.10] he's
[3432.10 → 3432.56] humbled
[3432.56 → 3433.40] and he
[3433.40 → 3434.66] accepts
[3434.66 → 3435.42] to be
[3435.42 → 3435.84] humble
[3435.84 → 3438.32] so on
[3438.32 → 3439.02] one level
[3439.02 → 3440.44] Elisha
[3440.44 → 3441.00] humbled
[3441.00 → 3442.00] humiliated
[3442.00 → 3442.38] him by
[3442.38 → 3442.96] not coming
[3442.96 → 3443.34] out
[3443.34 → 3444.62] and saying
[3444.62 → 3445.64] greeting
[3445.64 → 3446.06] him
[3446.06 → 3446.58] or welcoming
[3446.58 → 3446.92] him
[3446.92 → 3447.44] or even
[3447.44 → 3448.52] talking
[3448.52 → 3449.10] to this
[3449.10 → 3449.48] important
[3449.48 → 3449.80] guy
[3449.80 → 3450.90] there's a
[3450.90 → 3451.54] humiliation
[3451.54 → 3452.10] occurring
[3452.10 → 3453.28] and
[3453.28 → 3454.78] we see
[3454.78 → 3455.90] how hard
[3455.90 → 3456.68] and frustrating
[3456.68 → 3457.24] this was
[3457.24 → 3457.60] for this
[3457.60 → 3457.96] important
[3457.96 → 3458.24] man
[3458.24 → 3458.68] in those
[3458.68 → 3458.96] verses
[3458.96 → 3459.30] that we
[3459.30 → 3459.62] read
[3459.62 → 3461.74] verses
[3461.74 → 3462.48] 11 and
[3462.48 → 3462.82] 12
[3462.82 → 3464.14] about how
[3464.14 → 3464.84] angry
[3464.84 → 3465.48] he was
[3465.48 → 3466.26] it actually
[3466.26 → 3466.92] at the
[3466.92 → 3467.20] beginning
[3467.20 → 3467.80] of 11
[3467.80 → 3469.44] and the
[3469.44 → 3469.68] end
[3469.68 → 3470.24] of 12
[3470.24 → 3471.26] Norman
[3471.26 → 3472.08] went away
[3472.08 → 3472.70] angry
[3472.70 → 3473.98] he turned
[3473.98 → 3474.54] and went
[3474.54 → 3474.90] off
[3474.90 → 3475.32] in a
[3475.32 → 3475.86] rage
[3475.86 → 3477.48] this is
[3477.48 → 3477.84] what it
[3477.84 → 3478.44] feels like
[3478.44 → 3478.84] to be
[3478.84 → 3479.74] humiliated
[3479.74 → 3480.46] to have
[3480.46 → 3482.60] ought
[3482.60 → 3485.74] accept
[3485.74 → 3487.10] who we
[3487.10 → 3487.90] are as
[3487.90 → 3488.86] a success
[3488.86 → 3490.28] as entitled
[3490.28 → 3494.74] I think
[3494.74 → 3495.36] we do
[3495.36 → 3496.16] have a
[3496.16 → 3496.58] level of
[3496.58 → 3497.08] entitlement
[3497.08 → 3498.36] where we feel
[3498.36 → 3499.46] like we do
[3499.46 → 3499.96] deserve
[3499.96 → 3500.46] things
[3500.46 → 3501.50] we are
[3501.50 → 3501.80] a good
[3501.80 → 3502.26] person
[3502.26 → 3504.64] we are
[3504.64 → 3506.32] a success
[3506.32 → 3507.72] or we have
[3507.72 → 3508.46] certain rights
[3508.46 → 3509.06] and privileges
[3509.06 → 3509.84] just based on
[3509.84 → 3510.80] our citizenship
[3510.80 → 3512.22] or where we live
[3512.22 → 3513.62] and we wish
[3513.62 → 3514.44] people would just
[3514.44 → 3515.54] focus on the
[3515.54 → 3516.50] good in us
[3516.50 → 3517.96] and when they
[3517.96 → 3518.40] don't
[3518.40 → 3518.94] when they
[3518.94 → 3519.96] don't even
[3519.96 → 3520.52] like they
[3520.52 → 3521.32] ignore that
[3521.32 → 3522.86] and they
[3522.86 → 3523.40] see right
[3523.40 → 3523.76] at our
[3523.76 → 3524.26] core
[3524.26 → 3526.68] that's
[3526.68 → 3527.96] that's
[3527.96 → 3528.32] painful
[3528.32 → 3530.00] and our
[3530.00 → 3530.50] immediate
[3530.50 → 3531.22] response
[3531.22 → 3531.98] is anger
[3531.98 → 3532.52] but
[3532.52 → 3534.48] by God's
[3534.48 → 3534.90] grace
[3534.90 → 3536.14] there are
[3536.14 → 3536.62] these
[3536.62 → 3538.28] this cluster
[3538.28 → 3539.00] of characters
[3539.00 → 3540.12] who convey
[3540.12 → 3540.82] the message
[3540.82 → 3541.96] and repeat
[3541.96 → 3542.60] the message
[3542.60 → 3543.94] in a gentle
[3543.94 → 3544.50] way
[3544.50 → 3547.00] even though
[3547.00 → 3547.36] they're not
[3547.36 → 3547.76] believers
[3547.76 → 3549.36] isn't that
[3549.36 → 3550.04] God's grace
[3550.04 → 3551.24] that he's
[3551.24 → 3551.88] able to
[3551.88 → 3552.38] scatter
[3552.38 → 3552.92] people
[3552.92 → 3553.80] in the
[3553.80 → 3554.10] world
[3554.10 → 3554.70] who will
[3554.70 → 3555.06] be like
[3555.06 → 3555.78] the microphone
[3555.78 → 3556.54] or who
[3556.54 → 3556.78] will be
[3556.78 → 3557.48] megaphone
[3557.48 → 3558.30] or who
[3558.30 → 3559.44] use technology
[3559.44 → 3559.94] who will
[3559.94 → 3560.62] convey
[3560.62 → 3562.00] to the
[3562.00 → 3562.38] one who
[3562.38 → 3562.88] needs to
[3562.88 → 3563.42] hear the
[3563.42 → 3563.86] gospel
[3563.86 → 3565.34] the gospel
[3565.34 → 3567.56] the hope
[3567.56 → 3571.46] and
[3571.46 → 3572.14] Norman
[3572.14 → 3573.18] goes
[3573.18 → 3573.96] down
[3573.96 → 3575.66] that's
[3575.66 → 3576.32] an act
[3576.32 → 3577.22] of humility
[3577.22 → 3581.42] verse 14
[3581.42 → 3582.60] he went
[3582.60 → 3583.28] down
[3583.28 → 3586.96] you can
[3586.96 → 3587.86] just imagine
[3587.86 → 3588.54] him dipping
[3588.54 → 3589.38] you know
[3589.38 → 3589.64] like
[3589.64 → 3591.64] just the
[3591.64 → 3591.96] slightest
[3591.96 → 3592.66] little dips
[3592.66 → 3595.42] just going
[3595.42 → 3595.80] down
[3595.80 → 3596.92] just
[3596.92 → 3597.68] listening
[3597.68 → 3598.48] and accepting
[3598.48 → 3599.30] and saying
[3599.30 → 3601.18] just breathing
[3601.18 → 3604.84] and knowing
[3604.84 → 3605.62] he needed
[3605.62 → 3606.34] to do
[3606.34 → 3607.56] this
[3607.56 → 3608.50] even though
[3608.50 → 3608.78] it was
[3608.78 → 3609.48] humiliating
[3609.48 → 3613.48] so
[3613.48 → 3614.26] humiliation
[3614.26 → 3614.58] or
[3614.58 → 3616.02] humility
[3616.02 → 3616.74] or being
[3616.74 → 3617.18] humbled
[3617.18 → 3618.26] and
[3618.26 → 3619.08] then
[3619.08 → 3620.56] I would
[3620.56 → 3620.92] say his
[3620.92 → 3621.62] eyes were
[3621.62 → 3622.06] opened
[3622.06 → 3624.70] because
[3624.70 → 3625.74] in this
[3625.74 → 3626.42] act of
[3626.42 → 3626.88] humiliation
[3626.88 → 3627.40] he gets
[3627.40 → 3627.78] to the
[3627.78 → 3628.38] sixth
[3628.38 → 3628.98] time
[3628.98 → 3629.42] and the
[3629.42 → 3629.84] seventh
[3629.84 → 3630.34] time
[3630.34 → 3631.26] he comes
[3631.26 → 3631.86] up out
[3631.86 → 3632.08] of the
[3632.08 → 3632.38] water
[3632.38 → 3634.16] and he
[3634.16 → 3634.64] is
[3634.64 → 3636.06] transformed
[3636.06 → 3637.52] restored
[3637.52 → 3637.94] made
[3637.94 → 3638.50] clean
[3638.50 → 3639.82] like he'd
[3639.82 → 3640.48] never been
[3640.48 → 3640.80] clean
[3640.80 → 3641.18] before
[3641.18 → 3641.80] the thing
[3641.80 → 3642.22] at the
[3642.22 → 3642.46] very
[3642.46 → 3643.06] core
[3643.06 → 3643.94] is
[3643.94 → 3644.56] gone
[3644.56 → 3646.44] the
[3646.44 → 3647.08] pain
[3647.08 → 3648.06] that he
[3648.06 → 3648.84] could not
[3648.84 → 3649.42] overcome
[3649.42 → 3650.20] with all
[3650.20 → 3650.90] his success
[3650.90 → 3652.08] is healed
[3652.08 → 3655.28] his
[3655.28 → 3656.76] humility
[3656.76 → 3657.40] has been
[3657.40 → 3658.04] transformed
[3658.04 → 3658.68] into
[3658.68 → 3660.10] sight
[3660.10 → 3661.90] he
[3661.90 → 3662.68] sees
[3662.68 → 3664.52] life
[3664.52 → 3665.54] in a
[3665.54 → 3665.94] new way
[3665.94 → 3667.48] and
[3667.48 → 3669.06] the text
[3669.06 → 3670.14] triggers
[3670.14 → 3670.94] or indicates
[3670.94 → 3671.42] that by
[3671.42 → 3671.76] saying
[3671.76 → 3672.94] he went
[3672.94 → 3673.60] back
[3673.60 → 3674.90] so
[3674.90 → 3675.98] we actually
[3675.98 → 3676.88] saw how
[3676.88 → 3677.50] angry
[3677.50 → 3678.14] he was
[3678.14 → 3679.52] and
[3679.52 → 3680.46] now all
[3680.46 → 3680.88] of a sudden
[3680.88 → 3681.58] we see
[3681.58 → 3684.78] the anger
[3684.78 → 3685.00] has
[3685.00 → 3685.46] disappeared
[3685.46 → 3686.80] because he
[3686.80 → 3687.50] sees
[3687.50 → 3688.42] God
[3688.42 → 3691.24] he sees
[3691.24 → 3691.74] God
[3691.74 → 3692.70] and he
[3692.70 → 3693.14] sees
[3693.14 → 3693.92] Elisha
[3693.92 → 3694.32] in his
[3694.32 → 3694.72] place
[3694.72 → 3695.04] as
[3695.04 → 3696.34] the prophet
[3696.34 → 3697.80] the one
[3697.80 → 3698.20] pointing
[3698.20 → 3698.84] to God
[3698.84 → 3699.90] and we
[3699.90 → 3700.36] read that
[3700.36 → 3701.02] in verse
[3701.02 → 3701.48] 15
[3701.48 → 3701.96] now
[3701.96 → 3702.98] I know
[3702.98 → 3704.26] there is
[3704.26 → 3705.72] no God
[3705.72 → 3706.50] in all
[3706.50 → 3707.18] the world
[3707.18 → 3708.44] except
[3708.44 → 3709.20] in Israel
[3709.20 → 3711.58] I
[3711.58 → 3712.02] know
[3712.02 → 3713.44] I
[3713.44 → 3713.72] see
[3713.72 → 3713.96] it
[3713.96 → 3715.70] I'm
[3715.70 → 3716.00] trained
[3716.00 → 3716.72] and I'm
[3716.72 → 3717.24] transformed
[3717.24 → 3720.14] humbled
[3720.14 → 3721.34] he sees
[3721.34 → 3723.50] he goes
[3723.50 → 3724.00] back
[3724.00 → 3726.40] and he
[3726.40 → 3726.86] feels
[3726.86 → 3727.70] gratitude
[3727.70 → 3729.60] instead of
[3729.60 → 3730.04] wanting to
[3730.04 → 3730.68] pay for
[3730.68 → 3731.26] this thing
[3731.26 → 3731.98] or to
[3731.98 → 3732.46] feel like
[3732.46 → 3732.90] entitled
[3732.90 → 3733.54] and he
[3733.54 → 3733.98] will get
[3733.98 → 3734.34] what he
[3734.34 → 3734.74] wants
[3734.74 → 3735.54] now
[3735.54 → 3735.84] he
[3735.84 → 3736.44] all he
[3736.44 → 3736.84] wants
[3736.84 → 3737.26] is to
[3737.26 → 3737.78] give
[3737.78 → 3738.56] something
[3738.56 → 3739.04] back
[3739.04 → 3739.52] something
[3739.52 → 3740.06] to say
[3740.06 → 3740.72] how thankful
[3740.72 → 3741.24] he is
[3741.24 → 3745.18] where are
[3745.18 → 3745.58] you in
[3745.58 → 3745.84] this
[3745.84 → 3747.18] transformation
[3747.18 → 3748.20] process
[3748.20 → 3752.50] have you
[3752.50 → 3752.86] begun
[3752.86 → 3753.74] to experience
[3753.74 → 3754.56] humility
[3754.56 → 3755.16] and
[3755.16 → 3755.80] sight
[3755.80 → 3756.58] and
[3756.58 → 3757.10] gratitude
[3757.10 → 3761.98] not
[3761.98 → 3763.06] giving
[3763.06 → 3764.08] because you
[3764.08 → 3764.64] feel like
[3764.64 → 3765.04] it's going
[3765.04 → 3765.44] to get
[3765.44 → 3765.62] you
[3765.62 → 3766.00] something
[3766.00 → 3766.48] or you
[3766.48 → 3766.88] deserve
[3766.88 → 3767.36] something
[3767.36 → 3767.96] but giving
[3767.96 → 3768.74] because you've
[3768.74 → 3769.12] gotten
[3769.12 → 3769.76] something
[3769.76 → 3770.76] something was
[3770.76 → 3771.50] given to
[3771.50 → 3771.82] you
[3771.82 → 3772.52] that you
[3772.52 → 3772.92] didn't
[3772.92 → 3773.46] deserve
[3773.46 → 3775.68] gratitude
[3775.68 → 3776.52] that just
[3776.52 → 3777.80] is willing
[3777.80 → 3779.24] no longer
[3779.24 → 3779.92] to consider
[3779.92 → 3780.60] your own
[3780.60 → 3781.20] things
[3781.20 → 3782.08] as yours
[3782.08 → 3788.20] the fourth
[3788.20 → 3788.88] stage
[3788.88 → 3789.22] in
[3789.22 → 3789.78] Norman's
[3789.78 → 3790.28] transformation
[3790.28 → 3791.28] is
[3791.28 → 3792.74] a
[3792.74 → 3793.32] very
[3793.32 → 3794.28] strange
[3794.28 → 3795.00] verse
[3795.00 → 3795.56] in the
[3795.56 → 3795.86] Bible
[3795.86 → 3797.54] so in
[3797.54 → 3797.90] Egypt
[3797.90 → 3798.48] you know
[3798.48 → 3798.80] that we
[3798.80 → 3799.12] have
[3799.12 → 3799.84] donkeys
[3799.84 → 3800.98] we
[3800.98 → 3801.54] we see
[3801.54 → 3801.98] mules
[3801.98 → 3803.24] we see
[3803.24 → 3803.42] them
[3803.42 → 3803.90] everywhere
[3803.90 → 3804.68] not
[3804.68 → 3805.02] everywhere
[3805.02 → 3805.48] I'm
[3805.48 → 3805.74] sorry
[3805.74 → 3806.90] but
[3806.90 → 3807.52] very
[3807.52 → 3808.06] frequently
[3808.06 → 3809.72] much
[3809.72 → 3809.96] more
[3809.96 → 3810.36] frequently
[3810.36 → 3810.80] than you
[3810.80 → 3810.98] see
[3810.98 → 3811.50] horses
[3811.50 → 3812.82] I would
[3812.82 → 3813.40] say
[3813.40 → 3817.20] what's
[3817.20 → 3818.42] I don't
[3818.42 → 3818.66] know
[3818.66 → 3819.96] probably
[3819.96 → 3820.44] pick a
[3820.44 → 3820.80] species
[3820.80 → 3821.98] pick a
[3821.98 → 3822.92] particular
[3822.92 → 3823.50] breed of
[3823.50 → 3823.88] dog
[3823.88 → 3825.12] and
[3825.12 → 3825.96] or
[3825.96 → 3826.34] let's
[3826.34 → 3826.48] say
[3826.48 → 3826.92] five
[3826.92 → 3827.36] breeds
[3827.36 → 3827.82] poodles
[3827.82 → 3829.26] as often
[3829.26 → 3829.58] as you
[3829.58 → 3829.92] see a
[3829.92 → 3830.22] poodle
[3830.22 → 3831.72] we see
[3831.72 → 3832.20] donkeys
[3832.20 → 3833.46] in
[3833.46 → 3833.80] Egypt
[3833.80 → 3834.68] they're
[3834.68 → 3835.00] they're
[3835.00 → 3835.34] quite
[3835.34 → 3835.76] common
[3835.76 → 3836.72] and they're
[3836.72 → 3837.02] used
[3837.02 → 3837.56] for work
[3837.56 → 3838.36] even in
[3838.36 → 3838.96] the big
[3838.96 → 3839.26] city
[3839.26 → 3839.86] in Cairo
[3839.86 → 3844.26] this man
[3844.26 → 3845.50] in verse
[3845.50 → 3846.12] 17
[3846.12 → 3846.82] says
[3846.82 → 3848.00] give me
[3848.00 → 3848.72] as much
[3848.72 → 3849.48] earth
[3849.48 → 3851.46] as
[3851.46 → 3852.60] a pair
[3852.60 → 3853.28] of mules
[3853.28 → 3854.18] can carry
[3854.18 → 3855.30] mules are
[3855.30 → 3856.24] very strong
[3856.24 → 3861.54] he says
[3861.54 → 3862.28] because your
[3862.28 → 3862.96] servant will
[3862.96 → 3863.76] never again
[3863.76 → 3864.44] make
[3864.44 → 3865.46] offerings
[3865.46 → 3866.54] and sacrifices
[3866.54 → 3867.24] to any
[3867.24 → 3867.56] other
[3867.56 → 3868.14] God
[3868.14 → 3868.60] but the
[3868.60 → 3868.88] Lord
[3868.88 → 3872.20] I looked
[3872.20 → 3872.50] at this
[3872.50 → 3872.92] verse and I
[3872.92 → 3873.48] wondered what
[3873.48 → 3874.14] is this
[3874.14 → 3874.52] about
[3874.52 → 3878.92] and when I
[3878.92 → 3879.90] started to see it
[3879.90 → 3880.70] in light of his
[3880.70 → 3881.66] transformation I
[3881.66 → 3882.48] realized this
[3882.48 → 3883.86] verse is saying
[3883.86 → 3885.30] Norman wants
[3885.30 → 3886.84] to extend
[3886.84 → 3888.06] the borders
[3888.06 → 3888.86] of Israel
[3888.86 → 3890.78] the boundary
[3890.78 → 3891.72] he wants to
[3891.72 → 3892.70] actually move
[3892.70 → 3893.96] it so that
[3893.96 → 3895.08] he takes
[3895.08 → 3895.80] earth
[3895.80 → 3896.72] from Israel
[3896.72 → 3898.30] and he moves
[3898.30 → 3898.96] it out into
[3898.96 → 3899.80] Syria and he
[3899.80 → 3900.98] says this
[3900.98 → 3901.88] is where the
[3901.88 → 3902.48] new boundary
[3902.48 → 3903.24] is so that
[3903.24 → 3904.56] this temple
[3904.56 → 3905.12] that I end
[3905.12 → 3905.60] up in
[3905.60 → 3906.22] and the house
[3906.22 → 3906.76] that I live
[3906.76 → 3907.32] in and the
[3907.32 → 3908.06] places that I
[3908.06 → 3908.42] go
[3908.42 → 3909.80] the rivers
[3909.80 → 3911.96] the markets
[3911.96 → 3912.64] where I buy
[3912.64 → 3913.46] these clothes
[3913.46 → 3914.62] where I bank
[3914.62 → 3916.40] everywhere is
[3916.40 → 3917.04] going to be
[3917.04 → 3917.80] inside
[3917.80 → 3919.34] Israel as far
[3919.34 → 3919.64] as I'm
[3919.64 → 3920.08] concerned
[3920.08 → 3922.60] I'm going
[3922.60 → 3923.54] to extend
[3923.54 → 3924.68] God's kingdom
[3924.68 → 3925.60] with this
[3925.60 → 3926.06] act
[3926.06 → 3929.18] and that
[3929.18 → 3929.74] is what
[3929.74 → 3930.18] Jesus
[3930.18 → 3931.64] I think
[3931.64 → 3932.04] had in
[3932.04 → 3932.46] mind
[3932.46 → 3933.92] when he
[3933.92 → 3934.38] said
[3934.38 → 3935.86] this day
[3935.86 → 3937.94] this prophecy
[3937.94 → 3939.30] is fulfilled
[3939.30 → 3939.66] in your
[3939.66 → 3940.06] hearing
[3940.06 → 3941.96] that is
[3941.96 → 3942.40] I think
[3942.40 → 3942.80] what Jesus
[3942.80 → 3943.22] had in
[3943.22 → 3943.46] mind
[3943.46 → 3943.84] when
[3943.84 → 3946.90] he said
[3946.90 → 3947.26] to his
[3947.26 → 3947.74] disciples
[3947.74 → 3949.44] make
[3949.44 → 3950.06] disciples
[3950.06 → 3952.08] you
[3952.08 → 3952.68] will be
[3952.68 → 3953.04] filled
[3953.04 → 3953.78] with power
[3953.78 → 3955.14] and
[3955.14 → 3956.36] start
[3956.36 → 3956.80] here
[3956.80 → 3957.78] but don't
[3957.78 → 3958.24] stop
[3958.24 → 3959.62] go to
[3959.62 → 3960.22] the ends
[3960.22 → 3960.54] of the
[3960.54 → 3960.90] earth
[3960.90 → 3963.12] at the
[3963.12 → 3963.38] beginning
[3963.38 → 3963.68] of the
[3963.68 → 3963.96] book of
[3963.96 → 3964.32] Acts
[3964.32 → 3966.82] there is
[3966.82 → 3967.86] no place
[3967.86 → 3969.42] that isn't
[3969.42 → 3970.48] Israel
[3970.48 → 3972.16] all places
[3972.16 → 3973.00] where the
[3973.00 → 3973.32] church
[3973.32 → 3973.80] is
[3973.80 → 3974.70] are
[3974.70 → 3975.20] Israel
[3975.20 → 3977.22] that is
[3977.22 → 3978.20] what this
[3978.20 → 3978.50] little
[3978.50 → 3979.50] picture
[3979.50 → 3980.34] of the
[3980.34 → 3981.04] earth
[3981.04 → 3981.92] on mules
[3981.92 → 3983.00] is pointing
[3983.00 → 3983.26] to
[3983.26 → 3985.36] and the
[3985.36 → 3986.04] question I ask
[3986.04 → 3986.32] you are
[3986.32 → 3987.26] have you
[3987.26 → 3987.96] done what
[3987.96 → 3988.54] you can
[3988.54 → 3989.30] to extend
[3989.30 → 3990.08] God's kingdom
[3990.08 → 3990.66] into
[3990.66 → 3992.00] places that
[3992.00 → 3992.56] are otherwise
[3992.56 → 3993.16] dark
[3993.16 → 3996.14] places that
[3996.14 → 3996.56] otherwise
[3996.56 → 3997.28] wouldn't
[3997.28 → 3997.88] welcome
[3997.88 → 3999.84] worship
[3999.84 → 4000.66] of the
[4000.66 → 4001.24] true God
[4001.24 → 4005.60] the
[4005.60 → 4006.12] fifth
[4006.12 → 4007.94] transformation
[4007.94 → 4008.82] that occurs
[4008.82 → 4013.26] is that
[4013.26 → 4013.96] Norman
[4013.96 → 4014.76] wants to
[4014.76 → 4015.16] worship
[4015.16 → 4015.62] God
[4015.62 → 4016.26] himself
[4016.26 → 4018.12] he says
[4018.12 → 4020.52] your
[4020.52 → 4020.94] servant
[4020.94 → 4021.38] will never
[4021.38 → 4021.70] again
[4021.70 → 4021.98] make
[4021.98 → 4022.50] burnt
[4022.50 → 4023.32] sacrifices
[4023.32 → 4024.08] burnt
[4024.08 → 4024.52] offerings
[4024.52 → 4024.72] and
[4024.72 → 4025.26] sacrifices
[4025.26 → 4025.78] to any
[4025.78 → 4026.12] other
[4026.12 → 4026.44] God
[4026.44 → 4027.14] and
[4027.14 → 4027.88] this
[4027.88 → 4028.16] is
[4028.16 → 4028.52] him
[4028.52 → 4028.92] saying
[4028.92 → 4029.50] I
[4029.50 → 4029.88] will
[4029.88 → 4030.42] worship
[4030.42 → 4031.06] but
[4031.06 → 4032.02] if we
[4032.02 → 4032.60] understand
[4032.60 → 4033.08] the
[4033.08 → 4033.40] Hebrew
[4033.40 → 4033.86] concept
[4033.86 → 4034.14] of
[4034.14 → 4034.50] worship
[4034.50 → 4035.66] he
[4035.66 → 4035.92] is
[4035.92 → 4038.28] he
[4038.28 → 4038.56] is
[4038.56 → 4039.56] in
[4039.56 → 4039.96] some
[4039.96 → 4040.34] way
[4040.34 → 4041.24] setting
[4041.24 → 4041.74] it up
[4041.74 → 4042.22] for us
[4042.22 → 4042.82] to ask
[4042.82 → 4044.28] have
[4044.28 → 4044.86] we
[4044.86 → 4045.48] tried
[4045.48 → 4046.08] to make
[4046.08 → 4047.02] God's
[4047.02 → 4047.64] worship
[4047.64 → 4048.46] our
[4048.46 → 4049.28] worship
[4049.28 → 4050.66] in the
[4050.66 → 4051.04] way that
[4051.04 → 4051.32] the
[4051.32 → 4051.68] Hebrew
[4051.68 → 4052.16] thinker
[4052.16 → 4052.52] would have
[4052.52 → 4052.74] thought
[4052.74 → 4053.18] about it
[4053.18 → 4054.86] you see
[4054.86 → 4055.12] in
[4055.12 → 4055.76] Hebrew
[4055.76 → 4056.16] the
[4056.16 → 4058.52] the word
[4058.52 → 4059.08] for worship
[4059.08 → 4059.34] is
[4059.34 → 4060.02] avowal
[4060.02 → 4061.16] and
[4061.16 → 4061.80] it
[4061.80 → 4062.40] actually
[4062.40 → 4063.00] means
[4063.00 → 4063.54] work
[4063.54 → 4064.28] work
[4064.28 → 4064.88] and worship
[4064.88 → 4065.40] have the
[4065.40 → 4065.86] same
[4065.86 → 4066.44] word
[4066.44 → 4068.84] and
[4068.84 → 4069.70] what
[4069.70 → 4070.74] he
[4070.74 → 4070.98] is
[4070.98 → 4071.34] pointing
[4071.34 → 4071.70] to
[4071.70 → 4071.98] is
[4071.98 → 4072.32] saying
[4072.32 → 4072.86] I
[4072.86 → 4073.44] want
[4073.44 → 4074.34] to be
[4074.34 → 4074.76] able
[4074.76 → 4075.48] myself
[4075.48 → 4076.22] to
[4076.22 → 4076.80] extend
[4076.80 → 4077.12] not
[4077.12 → 4077.34] just
[4077.34 → 4077.72] God's
[4077.72 → 4078.06] kingdom
[4078.06 → 4078.84] but to
[4078.84 → 4079.16] use
[4079.16 → 4079.76] everything
[4079.76 → 4080.22] that
[4080.22 → 4081.00] takes
[4081.00 → 4081.50] energy
[4081.50 → 4081.84] from
[4081.84 → 4082.16] me
[4082.16 → 4083.82] every
[4083.82 → 4084.36] bit
[4084.36 → 4084.62] of
[4084.62 → 4086.06] investment
[4086.06 → 4086.94] of time

[4090.52 → 4092.68] let that
[4092.68 → 4093.18] be poured
[4093.18 → 4093.58] out in
[4093.58 → 4093.92] an act
[4093.92 → 4094.36] of worship
[4094.36 → 4095.20] wherever
[4095.20 → 4095.66] I go
[4095.66 → 4099.12] not just
[4099.12 → 4099.50] once
[4099.50 → 4100.20] a week
[4100.20 → 4100.48] or a
[4100.48 → 4100.76] month
[4100.76 → 4101.96] but
[4101.96 → 4102.34] all

[4104.98 → 4105.18] wants
[4105.18 → 4105.36] to
[4105.36 → 4105.66] worship
[4105.66 → 4106.44] real

[4110.68 → 4111.14] sixth
[4111.14 → 4111.88] transformation
[4111.88 → 4112.70] we see
[4112.70 → 4112.84] it
[4112.84 → 4113.30] twice
[4113.30 → 4114.80] in

[4118.80 → 4119.30] and the
[4119.30 → 4119.60] end
[4119.60 → 4120.12] we hear
[4120.12 → 4120.62] the word
[4120.62 → 4121.18] forgive
[4121.18 → 4122.40] your

[4123.08 → 4124.42] for this
[4124.42 → 4125.26] one thing
[4125.26 → 4126.46] two times
[4126.46 → 4132.26] he knows
[4132.26 → 4133.12] he is going
[4133.12 → 4133.92] to be making
[4133.92 → 4134.72] mistakes
[4134.72 → 4136.14] in this
[4136.14 → 4137.56] next chapter
[4137.56 → 4138.04] of his
[4138.04 → 4138.38] life
[4138.38 → 4140.46] he knows
[4140.46 → 4141.34] that when
[4141.34 → 4142.02] he goes
[4142.02 → 4143.02] back to
[4143.02 → 4143.38] Syria
[4143.38 → 4144.48] and extends
[4144.48 → 4145.14] the territory
[4145.14 → 4145.74] and tries
[4145.74 → 4146.24] to worship

[4148.16 → 4149.02] be serving
[4149.02 → 4150.04] beside the
[4150.04 → 4150.32] king
[4150.32 → 4151.34] and bowing
[4151.34 → 4151.76] down
[4151.76 → 4152.64] before this
[4152.64 → 4153.02] idol
[4153.02 → 4154.58] he knows
[4154.58 → 4155.40] that
[4155.40 → 4156.60] the culture

[4157.10 → 4157.56] back to
[4157.56 → 4158.14] the culture
[4158.14 → 4158.54] that he
[4158.54 → 4159.10] lives in
[4159.10 → 4160.14] is not
[4160.14 → 4161.16] a Christian
[4161.16 → 4161.64] culture
[4161.64 → 4162.66] is not
[4162.66 → 4163.94] a culture
[4163.94 → 4164.66] that knows
[4164.66 → 4165.04] the true
[4165.04 → 4165.40] God
[4165.40 → 4167.68] he knows
[4167.68 → 4167.96] it
[4167.96 → 4168.88] and he
[4168.88 → 4169.20] says
[4169.20 → 4169.76] please
[4169.76 → 4172.30] just this
[4172.30 → 4173.02] one thing
[4173.02 → 4174.56] forgive
[4174.56 → 4175.34] me when
[4175.34 → 4175.96] I mess
[4175.96 → 4176.22] up
[4176.22 → 4176.62] because
[4176.62 → 4177.04] my

[4177.62 → 4178.26] forces
[4178.26 → 4178.58] me
[4178.58 → 4178.82] to
[4178.82 → 4179.10] mess
[4179.10 → 4179.42] up
[4179.42 → 4182.36] and
[4182.36 → 4182.80] you
[4182.80 → 4183.00] would
[4183.00 → 4183.42] think
[4183.42 → 4183.70] that
[4183.70 → 4184.18] Elisha
[4184.18 → 4184.38] would

[4184.62 → 4184.94] no
[4184.94 → 4186.90] you
[4186.90 → 4187.08] would
[4187.08 → 4187.40] think
[4187.40 → 4187.68] that
[4187.68 → 4188.26] Elisha
[4188.26 → 4188.64] would

[4189.86 → 4190.10] got
[4190.10 → 4190.30] to

[4190.70 → 4190.88] you're
[4190.88 → 4190.98] going
[4190.98 → 4191.14] to

[4191.60 → 4191.80] this
[4191.80 → 4192.10] God
[4192.10 → 4192.32] then
[4192.32 → 4192.64] commit
[4192.64 → 4193.12] fully
[4193.12 → 4197.26] but
[4197.26 → 4197.44] he
[4197.44 → 4197.98] says
[4197.98 → 4198.66] go
[4198.66 → 4199.26] in
[4199.26 → 4200.10] peace

[4243.32 → 4243.76] something
[4243.76 → 4244.06] to

[4252.14 → 4253.62] Norman
[4253.62 → 4254.94] knew
[4254.94 → 4256.04] the

[4320.10 → 4320.38] there
[4320.38 → 4321.08] indirectly

[4460.38 → 4461.54] this

[4461.86 → 4464.02] for
[4464.02 → 4464.26] your

[4464.64 → 4465.62] in
[4465.62 → 4465.78] your
[4465.78 → 4466.06] name
[4466.06 → 4467.76] amen
[4467.76 → 4488.78] would
[4488.78 → 4488.88] you
[4488.88 → 4489.18] please
[4489.18 → 4489.48] rise
[4489.48 → 4489.64] as
[4489.64 → 4489.78] you're
[4489.78 → 4490.02] able
[4490.02 → 4491.14] to
[4491.14 → 4492.14] Amen.
[4521.14 → 4526.48] Make me a channel of your peace
[4526.48 → 4533.06] Where there is hatred let me bring your love
[4533.06 → 4540.12] Where there is injury your pardoned Lord
[4540.12 → 4546.40] And where there's doubt true faith in you
[4546.40 → 4553.72] Make me a channel of your peace
[4553.72 → 4559.80] Where there's despair in life let me bring hope
[4559.80 → 4567.34] Where there is darkness boldly light
[4567.34 → 4572.66] And where there's sadness ever joy
[4572.66 → 4579.98] Oh master breath that I may never see
[4579.98 → 4585.98] So much to be consoled as to console
[4585.98 → 4592.98] To be understood as to understand
[4592.98 → 4600.30] To be known as to love with all my soul
[4600.30 → 4607.62] Make me a channel of your peace
[4607.62 → 4615.62] It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
[4615.62 → 4621.62] In giving of ourselves that we receive
[4621.62 → 4628.94] And in dying that we're born to eternal love
[4628.94 → 4633.20] You may be seated
[4633.20 → 4648.26] This morning we have the privilege of offering our gifts
[4648.90 → 4651.48] to the Lord's purpose, the House of Omid.
[4651.58 → 4655.46] If you are a guest here, please do not feel obligated to contribute.
[4655.46 → 4660.14] But the House of Omid is in Burnaby I believe
[4660.14 → 4663.54] And it is a place where newcomers
[4663.54 → 4665.18] Mostly from the Middle East
[4665.18 → 4668.38] Can learn the English language
[4668.38 → 4670.76] They can fill out the forms they need to
[4670.76 → 4674.12] With the government to be able to settle here
[4674.12 → 4677.64] And they learn about our culture
[4677.64 → 4679.22] And our foods and all kinds of things
[4679.22 → 4681.62] So they are provided with the things
[4681.62 → 4683.46] They need to make a start here
[4683.46 → 4687.06] So also pray for that ministry as you give
[4687.06 → 4687.62] Thank you
[4687.62 → 4692.46] Amen.
[4692.56 → 4693.22] Amen.

[4822.98 → 4823.70] Let's pray together.
[4825.56 → 4833.46] Loving, gracious God, we come to you as children with delight, with thanks, and with our needs.
[4833.46 → 4839.34] We delight in your love for us and in knowing your faithfulness never ends.
[4840.14 → 4849.16] We delight in your saving grace and in knowing that your kingdom is coming and that we will live forever in your presence.
[4850.14 → 4853.82] We delight in the exhilaration of knowing you.
[4855.04 → 4858.02] We thank you for adopting us as your children.
[4858.58 → 4862.76] We thank you for your extravagant gifts in creation.
[4863.46 → 4872.28] The endless variety of plants, of birds and animals, of resources that you've placed within the earth.
[4872.94 → 4879.78] We thank you for the seasons, for the earth's bounty, for the beauty that surrounds us.
[4879.78 → 4884.66] We thank you for the seasons of work and seasons of rest.
[4885.46 → 4888.72] We pray for those on the forefront of creation care.
[4889.54 → 4891.34] Keep firefighters safe.
[4892.42 → 4897.04] Guide the work of those tasked with caring for wild animals and resources.
[4898.10 → 4899.42] This is your world.
[4900.04 → 4902.12] May we be careful stewards of it.
[4902.12 → 4903.12] We thank you for the Lord.
[4903.12 → 4907.60] We thank you for making us complex and beautiful after your image.
[4908.08 → 4914.36] We recognize that all is not as it should be, and we struggle with sin and with sickness.
[4915.16 → 4919.88] We pray for those experiencing pain, illness, and frailty.
[4920.72 → 4923.36] For those named and those not named.
[4923.36 → 4928.06] We ask for healing in this life and in the life to come.
[4928.98 → 4934.16] For those with emotional and mental struggles, give the peace that only you can.
[4935.32 → 4940.40] We pray for those grieving loss of loved ones, both recently and longer ago.
[4941.46 → 4943.60] Give comfort and hope, we pray.
[4945.04 → 4948.96] Replace loneliness with the presence of your all-sufficient spirit.
[4948.96 → 4957.80] May each of the people mentioned in our bulletin, Judy and Robin, Edgar, Suzanne, and their family, and Edgar's father.
[4958.64 → 4962.48] Michael Wayne and Wilma, the family of Mini Dean.
[4963.42 → 4966.66] May they all know that you go before them and with them.
[4967.48 → 4970.62] Thank you for healing in all sorts of ways in our lives.
[4971.40 → 4976.08] Thank you for your word and for leading us and for never letting us go.
[4976.08 → 4980.84] God of the nations, we pray for global leaders.
[4981.84 → 4986.76] For peace where there is war, either from external enemies or internal clashes.
[4987.64 → 4992.06] We pray for people caught in the middle of a conflict they want nothing to do with.
[4993.16 → 5000.14] The greatest miracle would be that leaders of these nations and conflicting groups would embrace the gospel of your peace.
[5000.14 → 5005.58] As impossible as that may sound to our ears, this is our request.
[5006.34 → 5010.36] You are the one who melts hearts made of stone.
[5011.14 → 5012.72] May your kingdom come.
[5014.34 → 5018.48] Lord, we thank you for those who bring your gospel message throughout the world.
[5019.48 → 5022.24] We thank you for Ajee here with us this morning.
[5023.06 → 5025.90] We pray for him and Anne and their work in Egypt.
[5025.90 → 5032.54] Grant them strength and wisdom as they seek to bring the good news to a country often hostile to it.
[5033.66 → 5036.96] We pray for their safety and also for joy in their labours.
[5037.72 → 5042.12] We pray for Hannah in Greece and ask that you will renew her in a time of rest
[5042.12 → 5046.12] so that she can carry on her work faithfully with renewed energy.
[5046.12 → 5053.52] We also pray for renewed energy for Pastor Jason and Pastor Nancy for the upcoming year as well.
[5054.78 → 5062.64] As we leave this place, we ask for your grace in us so that your kingdom may come in our hearts and in our neighbourhoods.
[5063.32 → 5065.90] We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[5065.90 → 5066.00] Amen.
[5069.38 → 5078.78] And as Ajee comes up to give us the blessing, I just want to remind everyone that we have refreshments in the fellowship hall
[5078.78 → 5082.32] and we can visit together for a while right after the service.
[5083.20 → 5083.84] Thank you, Ajee.
[5087.84 → 5088.76] Stand with me.
[5088.76 → 5088.78] Thank you.
[5088.78 → 5098.72] This blessing begins with the word but.
[5100.72 → 5107.52] In the sense that, but he had leprosy is not the final word.
[5107.52 → 5120.04] But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[5121.04 → 5125.18] To him be glory both now and forever.
[5125.18 → 5126.98] Amen.
[5137.52 → 5148.90] My friends, may you grow in grace.
[5148.90 → 5154.24] And in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.
[5155.74 → 5162.00] My friends, may you grow in grace.
[5162.00 → 5168.62] And in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[5168.62 → 5175.38] To God be the glory now and forever.
[5175.38 → 5179.38] Now and forever.
[5179.38 → 5180.38] Amen.
[5180.38 → 5188.78] To God be the glory now and forever.
[5188.78 → 5211.84] Now and forever.

[5241.84 → 5243.84] Amen.
