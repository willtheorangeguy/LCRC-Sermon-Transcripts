• Three ways God makes friends from enemies: showing love, assuring salvation, and joyful confidence
• Human love is typically responsive and attracted to something lovable in others
• God's love, however, is not based on human worth or loveliness, but rather on His own initiative
• Christ died for the ungodly and powerless, those who were unable to love God
• The gospel declares that God's love is demonstrated through Christ's death for sinners while they were still enemies of God
• This demonstrates the unconditional nature of God's love, not based on human worthiness or deservingness.
• God gives his greatest gift to the most unworthy recipients
• Christ's death shows and proves God's love for humanity
• The gospel is that Christ died for sinners, ungodly people, enemies, and the weak
• God makes us his friends by showing us his love and then assuring us of our salvation
• Verse 9 explains how we are saved from God's wrath through Jesus' death on the cross
• Propitiation, expiation, and justification are theological terms used to describe how God deals with humanity
• God's wrath is not like a father losing patience with his daughter
• God's wrath is an aspect of his holiness and opposition to sin and evil
• Jesus saved us from God's judgment by absorbing the holy opposition to sin
• Expiation: Christ's blood covers our sin, making forgiveness possible
• Justification: through Jesus' death, we are reconciled with God and made friends
• The death of Jesus' son reconciles us to God, and his life will save us.
• If God loved us while we were sinners, how much more will he love us now that we are his children?
• Nothing in us can cause God to stop loving us because Jesus has already done everything for our salvation.
• Once we believe in Jesus, we will always be God's friend and have joyful confidence in our salvation.

• Showing love to someone who is not expecting it, especially an enemy, is out of the ordinary
