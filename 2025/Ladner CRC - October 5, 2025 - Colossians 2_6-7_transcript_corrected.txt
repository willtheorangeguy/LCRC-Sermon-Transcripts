[502.30 → 519.30] BEV warned me, I have to be quick. I'm not so quick anymore.
[519.30 → 523.30] So, today's questions.
[523.30 → 529.30] Who remembers how many children this church supported back in 1994?
[529.30 → 534.30] Ukrainian children that had been affected by the Chernobyl disaster?
[534.30 → 540.30] Some of you, I know, even housed some of those children, one or more of them.
[540.30 → 543.30] And when was that?
[543.30 → 552.30] And, which of our former pastors has had the longest day here at Ladder CRC?
[552.30 → 555.30] And how many years was he here?
[555.30 → 558.30] Listen, you all need to come.

[579.30 → 584.30] You'll get the answers to these questions and all the questions you missed the last few weeks.
[584.30 → 588.30] And, think about it, 75 years.
[588.30 → 597.30] We'll be able to celebrate 75 years of God's faithfulness, goodness and grace shown to us here.
[597.30 → 603.30] In a church community that also was a light in our community and the communities abroad.
[603.30 → 607.30] So, make sure that you've signed up.
[607.30 → 611.30] You've signed up your relatives, your friends that are now afar.
[611.30 → 615.30] Anybody that wants to come, we need your RSVPs.
[615.30 → 617.30] We need them by Friday.
[617.30 → 620.30] We have to give a number to the caterer.
[620.30 → 621.30] Very important.
[621.30 → 626.30] So, please, if you haven't signed up yet, sign up at the foyer table.

[647.30 → 649.30] Leave it in the box at the back.
[649.30 → 652.30] We'd love to be able to use that.
[652.30 → 656.30] And, most importantly, join us.
[656.30 → 658.30] 2 weeks, Saturday.
[658.30 → 660.30] 2 p.m. right here.
[660.30 → 663.30] Actually, it'll be, we'll start off in the foyer area.
[663.30 → 665.30] In the other areas of the church.
[665.30 → 668.30] And, our celebration will kick off.
[668.30 → 669.30] 2 o'clock.
[669.30 → 672.30] We'll have a time of fellowship.
[672.30 → 674.30] Getting this information.

[676.30 → 679.30] And, all the background for 75 years.
[679.30 → 688.30] We'll follow that up with a celebration service here at approximately 315 in this sanctuary.
[688.30 → 699.30] And, we'll be able to be reminded of a real commemorative time, fellowship, and commemorate in word, in song.
[699.30 → 706.30] And, reminding vividly of Ladder CRC's legacy here in this community.
[706.30 → 708.30] That'll be followed by refreshments.
[708.30 → 710.30] And, of course, cake.
[710.30 → 712.30] It's absolute.
[712.30 → 713.30] All right.
[713.30 → 714.30] Final note.
[714.30 → 718.30] Also, worship service on the Sunday, the 19th.
[718.30 → 719.30] Following.
[719.30 → 722.30] That'll cap our weekend of celebration.
[722.30 → 727.30] And, be reflective also of our past 75 years.
[727.30 → 728.30] Please join us.
[728.30 → 729.30] Thank you.
[737.30 → 740.30] Our call to worship is on the screen.
[740.30 → 742.30] Please follow along.
[743.30 → 747.30] Happy are those who follow the ways of the Lord.
[747.30 → 750.30] God's ways are just and merciful.
[750.30 → 755.30] Those who follow God's ways are continually nourished in faith.
[755.30 → 757.30] And, all they do.
[757.30 → 759.30] They prosper.
[759.30 → 764.30] Come, let us open our hearts to God's compassionate love.
[764.30 → 768.30] Let us celebrate God's mercy and justice.
[768.30 → 769.30] Amen.
[771.30 → 775.30] I would like to offer a prayer of adoration that is actually a hymn,
[775.30 → 778.30] O God, Beyond All Praising, that we are going to be singing today.
[778.30 → 781.30] So, please, pray with me.
[784.30 → 791.30] O God, Beyond All Praising, we worship you today and sing the love amazing that songs cannot repay.
[791.30 → 801.30] For we can only wonder at every gift you send, at blessings without number and mercies without end.
[802.30 → 806.30] We lift our hearts before you and wait upon your word.
[806.30 → 811.30] We honour and adore you, our great and mighty Lord.
[811.30 → 822.30] Then hear, O gracious Saviour, accept the love we bring, that we who know your favour may serve you as our king.
[822.30 → 830.30] And whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill, we'll triumph through our sorrow and rise to bless you still.
[830.30 → 840.30] To marvel at your beauty and glory in your ways and make a joyful duty our sacrifice of praise.
[840.30 → 841.30] Amen.
[843.30 → 846.30] The Lord greets us with these words this morning.
[846.30 → 853.30] To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father, and kept safe for Jesus Christ.
[853.30 → 857.30] May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[857.30 → 867.30] If you're able to stand as the Lord has greeted us, let's greet each other.
[887.30 → 888.30] That's a quarrel, Sana so only tokes.
[888.30 → 893.30] God is the full bear childna or UNB karma.
[893.30 → 897.30] Amen.
[905.30 → 910.30] Xi Jinping's family may be unearned from one of visages, who either can not bear to within again.
[911.30 → 914.30] If you're only comical to 의미, you're not seeking a small nation.
[914.30 → 935.94] O God, beyond all praising, we worship you today.
[935.94 → 944.36] And sing the love amazing that souls cannot repay.
[945.30 → 953.20] For we can only wonder at every gift you send.
[953.62 → 960.94] At blessings without number and mercies without end.
[960.94 → 969.78] We lift our hearts before you and wait upon your word.
[970.26 → 978.40] We honour and adore you, our great and mighty Lord.
[980.48 → 987.94] O flower of this splendour, it's time I surely die.
[987.94 → 996.78] It's fragile to surrender to the Lord most high.
[997.24 → 1004.94] But hidden from all nature, the eternal sings his song.
[1005.44 → 1012.72] Most all the world's stature to heaven's garden grow.
[1012.72 → 1021.56] For Christ, our gift from heaven, comes and sets us free.
[1022.02 → 1029.00] And we through him are given the final victory.
[1029.00 → 1044.34] And we will know your favour.
[1044.34 → 1048.42] We serve you as our King.
[1048.64 → 1056.70] And whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill.
[1057.06 → 1064.34] We'll drive home the sorrow and rise to bless you still.
[1064.34 → 1073.06] To more marvel at your beauty and glory in your ways.
[1073.06 → 1077.06] And make the joy for beauty.
[1077.56 → 1081.34] Oh, sacrifice of me.
[1081.34 → 1091.02] And this next song, rejoice, is one we're introducing to our church family here.
[1091.56 → 1093.38] I think it was last Sunday.
[1093.82 → 1094.84] For the first time.
[1095.22 → 1099.54] And let's rejoice with this song together this morning.
[1099.54 → 1126.18] We rejoice in the love he has shown us.
[1126.52 → 1129.52] Great to lift your place.
[1129.82 → 1133.66] His gentleness among us.
[1133.70 → 1136.72] And joy our hearts will fade.
[1137.52 → 1141.30] We gather in his goodness.
[1141.66 → 1144.82] A family of hate.
[1145.08 → 1148.42] The death we've given.
[1148.42 → 1156.30] Praise the Lord, in this time we live in
[1156.30 → 1163.54] We will praise you Lord, for every season
[1163.54 → 1171.16] I am sure we have ever risen
[1171.16 → 1175.42] To praise you Lord
[1178.42 → 1185.48] Reacher's ambitious for nothing
[1185.48 → 1189.18] Wait for all that you need
[1189.18 → 1192.84] Come with the song of thanksgiving
[1192.84 → 1196.48] May your request have misled
[1196.48 → 1200.88] His peace will fall upon us
[1200.88 → 1204.14] God has lost in mind
[1204.14 → 1211.20] Impostures eternal shepherd of our life
[1211.20 → 1216.10] Which is where we live in
[1216.10 → 1223.14] Praise the Lord, in this time we live in
[1223.14 → 1230.58] We will praise the Lord, through our every season
[1230.58 → 1237.64] I am sure we have every reason
[1237.64 → 1242.64] To praise the Lord
[1242.64 → 1259.70] Rejoice in the Lord, now and always
[1259.70 → 1262.70] Tell of the Lord, He has done
[1262.70 → 1267.76] Worship the Lord, through our manner
[1267.76 → 1270.76] All the joy that has come
[1270.76 → 1274.76] New hope that burns with manna's
[1274.76 → 1277.76] You are not destroyed
[1277.76 → 1282.82] With praise and severity
[1282.82 → 1285.82] We say again, reach towards
[1285.82 → 1289.82] With each prayer we give up
[1289.82 → 1296.82] Praise the Lord, in these times we live in
[1296.82 → 1301.88] We will praise the Lord, through our every season
[1301.88 → 1303.88] Through our every season
[1303.88 → 1307.88] I am sure we have every reason
[1307.88 → 1309.88] To praise the Lord
[1309.88 → 1311.88] We have every reason
[1311.88 → 1313.88] To praise the Lord
[1313.88 → 1315.88] We have every reason
[1315.88 → 1317.88] To praise the Lord
[1317.88 → 1318.88] Every reason
[1318.88 → 1324.88] To praise the Lord
[1324.88 → 1338.88] Amen
[1338.88 → 1339.54] Amen
[1339.54 → 1350.10] Our Old Testament reading for today is from Psalm 92
[1350.10 → 1354.52] Which can be found on page 445 in your Pew Bible
[1354.52 → 1358.56] I'll be reading Psalm 92 verses 1 through 8
[1358.56 → 1360.58] And 12 through 15
[1360.58 → 1364.60] A song for the Sabbath day
[1364.60 → 1368.64] It is good to praise the Lord
[1368.64 → 1371.16] And make music in your name, O Most High
[1371.16 → 1373.00] Proclaiming your love in the morning
[1373.00 → 1375.60] And your faithfulness at night
[1375.60 → 1379.26] To the music of the ten-stringed lyre
[1379.26 → 1380.92] And the melody of the harp
[1380.92 → 1384.36] For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord
[1384.36 → 1388.26] I sing for joy at what your hands have done
[1388.26 → 1390.98] How great are your works, Lord
[1390.98 → 1392.70] How profound your thoughts
[1392.70 → 1395.20] Senseless people do not know
[1395.20 → 1397.32] Fools do not understand
[1397.32 → 1400.20] That though the wicked spring up like grass
[1400.20 → 1402.58] And all evildoers flourish
[1402.58 → 1405.90] They will be destroyed forever
[1405.90 → 1408.92] But you, Lord, are forever exalted
[1408.92 → 1412.68] The righteous will flourish like a palm tree
[1412.68 → 1415.36] They will grow like a cedar of Lebanon
[1415.36 → 1417.70] Planted in the house of the Lord
[1417.70 → 1420.38] They will flourish in the courts of our God
[1420.38 → 1423.76] They will still bear fruit in old age
[1423.76 → 1426.10] They will stay fresh and green
[1426.10 → 1428.92] Proclaiming, the Lord is upright
[1428.92 → 1430.56] He is my rock
[1430.56 → 1433.66] And there is no wickedness in him
[1433.66 → 1436.30] This is the word of the Lord
[1436.30 → 1438.18] Thanks be to God
[1438.18 → 1441.08] At this time of confession
[1441.08 → 1443.46] I would like to offer a prayer of confession
[1443.46 → 1445.72] Please pray with me
[1445.72 → 1449.38] Lord Jesus Christ
[1449.38 → 1452.88] We know that when we become disconnected from you
[1452.88 → 1456.06] Our lives become parched and unfruitful
[1456.06 → 1458.88] And our faith becomes stunted and dry
[1458.88 → 1462.34] We need your spirit to renew our lives
[1462.34 → 1465.88] We need to remain connected to you at all times
[1465.88 → 1467.28] And in all places
[1467.28 → 1469.98] Strengthening our faith to expand
[1469.98 → 1472.74] And growing strongly and vigorously
[1472.74 → 1474.90] To bear the fruit of your mercy
[1474.90 → 1476.02] Your love
[1476.02 → 1477.88] Your undying life
[1477.88 → 1479.12] Amen
[1479.12 → 1482.42] Please join in these words of confession
[1482.42 → 1484.18] Reading responsibly
[1484.18 → 1490.72] Merciful one, you know when we are afraid to love
[1490.72 → 1493.78] You know when we are too cowardly to show mercy
[1493.78 → 1496.20] Remind us again
[1496.20 → 1499.94] That perfect love casts out all spheres
[1499.94 → 1503.98] Surround us and strengthen us with your perfect love
[1503.98 → 1507.12] Even in the face of our imperfections
[1507.12 → 1511.14] Imbue us with a love so strong
[1511.14 → 1513.92] With such growth toward perfection
[1513.92 → 1517.50] That we may cast aside our pride
[1517.50 → 1520.44] And embrace the power of love
[1520.44 → 1523.72] Hear these words of assurance
[1523.72 → 1528.62] In Jesus you who were once far off
[1528.62 → 1531.90] Have been brought nearby the blood of Christ
[1531.90 → 1536.46] In him we have been reconciled to God through the cross
[1536.46 → 1540.60] Made citizens with the saints and members of the household of God
[1540.60 → 1543.86] Hear then the good news
[1543.86 → 1546.96] That in Jesus Christ we are forgiven
[1546.96 → 1549.46] Thanks be to God
[1549.46 → 1553.48] Amen
[1553.48 → 1566.96] Amen
[1567.24 → 1567.58] Amen
[1567.58 → 1571.86] Amen
[1571.86 → 1572.28] Amen
[1572.28 → 1580.56] Here is love, blessed as the ocean
[1580.56 → 1585.36] Love and kindness has been found
[1585.36 → 1589.40] When the Prince of life are written
[1589.40 → 1594.34] Shed for us His precious blood
[1594.34 → 1598.74] Who is love, will not remember
[1598.74 → 1603.96] Who can see the same as grace
[1603.96 → 1608.02] He can never be forgotten
[1608.02 → 1613.66] Throughout His eternal days
[1613.66 → 1619.74] On the Mount of Circumcision
[1619.74 → 1625.02] Fountains open deep and wide
[1625.02 → 1629.40] Through the pockets of God's mercy
[1629.40 → 1634.48] Flow a vast and gracious light
[1634.48 → 1639.30] Grace and love like my dear in earth
[1639.30 → 1643.24] Born in sustenance from above
[1643.24 → 1648.64] Heaven's peace and perfect justice
[1648.64 → 1653.04] Kissed and guilty, warm in love
[1653.04 → 1659.42] On the Mount of Fríður-lisish
[1659.42 → 1664.50] Mercy filled and thirsty gray
[1664.50 → 1669.42] Where the stone of death were open
[1669.42 → 1674.46] Springs of love, love unrestrained
[1674.46 → 1678.50] Come to heart, forever mission
[1678.50 → 1682.88] Join us, Lord, for the love of God
[1682.88 → 1687.88] Rushed upon us, so believing
[1687.88 → 1692.96] In the risen, reigning sun
[1692.96 → 1699.88] Oh, this love, vast love of Jesus
[1699.88 → 1704.50] Does us come and drink and live
[1704.50 → 1708.88] To this weary world of longing
[1708.88 → 1713.88] One more could our Saviour give
[1713.88 → 1719.16] Now to Christ who fully loved us
[1719.16 → 1722.88] And who freed us from our sin
[1722.88 → 1727.88] Be our glory and dominion
[1727.88 → 1742.26] Everlasting praise to Him
[1742.26 → 1746.26] Everlasting praise to Him
[1746.26 → 1751.26] Everlasting praise to Him
[1751.26 → 1757.64] Everlasting praise to Him
[1757.64 → 1762.02] Holy words, God, present for our Lord
[1762.02 → 1780.40] For our walk in this world
[1780.40 → 1785.78] Holy words, God, present for our Lord
[1785.78 → 1789.78] For our walk in this world
[1789.78 → 1793.78] Every stone with God's heart
[1793.78 → 1798.78] Oh, with the ancient word it pours
[1798.78 → 1803.78] Words of love, words of hope
[1803.78 → 1808.16] Give us strength that was put
[1808.16 → 1812.16] In this world where it all
[1812.16 → 1817.16] Ancient words will guide us home
[1817.16 → 1823.16] Ancient words, heaven's true
[1823.16 → 1827.16] Changing me and changing you
[1827.16 → 1831.54] We have come and open up
[1831.54 → 1836.54] Only the ancient word in part
[1836.54 → 1842.64] Only words of faith
[1842.64 → 1846.92] And it's bound to this age
[1846.92 → 1850.54] Come to us through sacrifice
[1850.54 → 1855.16] All heed the faithful words of Christ
[1855.16 → 1857.54] Ancient words, heaven's true
[1857.54 → 1861.54] Ancient words, heaven's true
[1861.54 → 1862.54] Ancient words, heaven's true
[1862.54 → 1865.54] Changing me and changing you
[1865.54 → 1869.54] We have come and open up
[1869.54 → 1874.54] All the ancient word in part
[1874.54 → 1878.42] Ancient words, heaven's true
[1878.42 → 1882.54] Changing me and changing you
[1882.54 → 1886.92] We have come and open up
[1886.92 → 1891.54] All the ancient word in part
[1891.54 → 1905.54] Born of love, skin and change
[1905.54 → 1910.54] They have died for this day
[1910.54 → 1914.92] Read and cry through the years
[1914.92 → 1918.92] Hear the words and hope and deal
[1918.92 → 1925.04] Ancient words, ever true
[1925.04 → 1928.92] Changing me and changing you
[1928.92 → 1932.92] We have come and open up
[1932.92 → 1937.54] All the ancient words in part
[1937.54 → 1943.92] We have come and open up
[1943.92 → 1947.92] All the ancient words in part
[1947.92 → 1949.92] All the ancient words in part
[1949.92 → 1955.92] All the ancient words in part
[1955.92 → 1959.92] You may be seated
[1959.92 → 1973.00] At this time our Sunday school children
[1973.00 → 1974.88] Are dismissed to go to their classes
[1974.88 → 1977.94] Children aged three through grade five
[1977.94 → 1980.36] And we bless them and their teachers
[1980.36 → 1988.20] And we welcome Pastor George Kulun
[1988.20 → 1989.74] To our pulpit today
[1989.74 → 2003.00] Well good morning
[2003.00 → 2005.70] It is good to be here again
[2005.70 → 2007.50] With you this morning
[2007.50 → 2008.60] To share God's word
[2008.60 → 2010.18] With you
[2010.18 → 2012.98] I also look forward to
[2012.98 → 2014.44] Yeah, being with you in two weeks time
[2014.44 → 2015.28] At the Saturday event
[2015.28 → 2017.72] Celebrating the 75-year anniversary
[2017.72 → 2019.02] Of Ladder CRC
[2019.02 → 2022.14] I was saying to Joe a couple of weeks ago
[2022.14 → 2023.12] Or months ago even
[2023.12 → 2024.02] When I first heard of this
[2024.02 → 2024.76] I'm always amazed
[2024.76 → 2025.60] At all the different churches
[2025.60 → 2027.10] I preach in throughout
[2027.10 → 2028.22] The lower mainland
[2028.22 → 2030.52] People often come up to me
[2030.52 → 2031.80] After the service
[2031.80 → 2032.62] And they know that
[2032.62 → 2033.80] This was my home church
[2033.80 → 2034.90] That this is where I grew up
[2034.90 → 2035.86] And they also share
[2035.86 → 2036.96] About their time
[2036.96 → 2038.42] Growing up in Ladder
[2038.42 → 2039.52] And it's amazing to see
[2039.52 → 2042.42] The faith that was born
[2042.42 → 2043.22] That was taught
[2043.22 → 2043.92] That was raised
[2043.92 → 2045.28] In this church
[2045.28 → 2046.52] And the legacy that this church
[2046.52 → 2047.90] Has throughout the lower mainland
[2047.90 → 2049.62] And obviously much wider than that
[2049.62 → 2049.92] I'm sure
[2049.92 → 2052.28] Throughout the whole province too
[2052.28 → 2053.80] But it's always fun
[2053.80 → 2054.96] To meet members
[2054.96 → 2055.70] In different churches
[2055.70 → 2057.18] And sharing this
[2057.18 → 2058.52] Or having our roots here
[2058.52 → 2059.24] In Ladder
[2059.24 → 2060.30] Having that in common
[2060.30 → 2062.64] Two of those former members
[2062.64 → 2063.40] Are here this morning
[2063.40 → 2064.92] I saw Jake and Gerda Lewin
[2064.92 → 2066.86] Joining us this morning here
[2066.86 → 2067.80] Unfortunately for them
[2067.80 → 2069.50] They've heard this sermon
[2069.50 → 2070.86] Already in their home church
[2070.86 → 2071.50] And so
[2071.50 → 2072.90] If you see them get out
[2072.90 → 2073.94] And go for coffee early
[2073.94 → 2074.54] That's okay
[2074.54 → 2076.42] They've already heard this word
[2076.42 → 2076.76] So
[2076.76 → 2078.28] It's okay
[2078.28 → 2081.50] Before we open God's word together
[2081.50 → 2082.58] Let us have a word of prayer
[2082.58 → 2085.34] Lord God
[2085.34 → 2087.16] As we open your word
[2087.16 → 2088.62] May you lead us
[2088.62 → 2089.76] By the inspiration
[2089.76 → 2090.96] Of your Holy Spirit
[2090.96 → 2092.98] May the words of our mouths
[2092.98 → 2093.76] And the meditations
[2093.76 → 2094.52] Of our heart
[2094.52 → 2095.66] Be pleasing to you
[2095.66 → 2096.30] Lord God
[2096.30 → 2097.72] We ask this
[2097.72 → 2098.64] In the name of the Father
[2098.64 → 2099.80] Son and Holy Spirit
[2099.80 → 2100.86] Amen
[2100.86 → 2103.48] Friends
[2103.48 → 2105.58] We live in a time
[2105.58 → 2106.02] Really
[2106.02 → 2107.46] Where everything
[2107.46 → 2108.98] Seems to be measured
[2108.98 → 2110.06] For progress
[2110.06 → 2111.40] We have apps
[2111.40 → 2112.14] On our phone
[2112.14 → 2112.94] We have watches
[2112.94 → 2113.76] On our wrists
[2113.76 → 2114.48] That can measure
[2114.48 → 2116.06] Everything about our movement
[2116.06 → 2116.94] And even our sleep
[2116.94 → 2117.60] During the day
[2117.60 → 2118.32] How many steps
[2118.32 → 2119.68] We take in a day
[2119.68 → 2120.74] How far we walk
[2120.74 → 2121.20] In a day
[2121.20 → 2122.34] How fast it takes us
[2122.34 → 2122.82] To get there
[2122.82 → 2124.18] What our heart rate is
[2124.18 → 2124.82] At any time
[2124.82 → 2126.16] What our oxygen saturation
[2126.16 → 2127.78] Is at any time
[2127.78 → 2129.08] Everything can be measured
[2129.08 → 2130.42] When we go into elections
[2130.42 → 2131.68] We have polls
[2131.68 → 2132.84] Taken every single day
[2132.84 → 2133.62] To know how good
[2133.62 → 2134.92] Each political party
[2134.92 → 2135.40] Is doing
[2135.40 → 2136.10] Our economy
[2136.10 → 2137.24] Is constantly measured
[2137.24 → 2138.72] To know how we stack up
[2138.72 → 2139.64] Against other countries
[2139.64 → 2140.58] How we are doing
[2140.58 → 2141.74] Within our cars
[2141.74 → 2142.54] Or our trucks
[2142.54 → 2143.20] We have things
[2143.20 → 2144.20] That are always measured
[2144.20 → 2145.10] Fuel economy
[2145.10 → 2146.42] Battery economy
[2146.42 → 2148.42] Fuel and battery economy
[2148.42 → 2149.88] Within big trucking companies
[2149.88 → 2151.48] Drivers are giving incentives
[2151.48 → 2152.60] For how they drive
[2152.60 → 2153.86] On certain routes
[2153.86 → 2155.38] Even in my wife's car
[2155.38 → 2156.62] I'm someone who likes to drive
[2156.62 → 2157.46] With a window down
[2157.46 → 2158.92] Whenever I drive her car
[2158.92 → 2160.14] Her car always tells me
[2160.14 → 2161.48] Please close the window
[2161.48 → 2162.96] It's bad for fuel economy
[2162.96 → 2165.66] And I won't share with you
[2165.66 → 2166.20] From up here
[2166.20 → 2167.28] What I say back to the car
[2167.28 → 2167.86] When it tells me
[2167.86 → 2168.62] To close my window
[2168.62 → 2171.52] But it seems that
[2171.52 → 2172.46] Everything today
[2172.46 → 2174.20] Is measured to epitomize
[2174.20 → 2176.32] Productivity or progress
[2176.32 → 2178.30] However when it comes
[2178.30 → 2179.42] To our faith
[2179.42 → 2180.36] Something that should be
[2180.36 → 2181.14] Most important
[2181.14 → 2182.62] We actually spend
[2182.62 → 2183.70] Very little time
[2183.70 → 2184.92] Thinking about this
[2184.92 → 2186.42] When was the time
[2186.42 → 2187.38] Last time you maybe
[2187.38 → 2188.38] Asked yourselves
[2188.38 → 2190.06] How have I been growing
[2190.06 → 2190.90] In my faith
[2190.90 → 2191.74] Or more importantly
[2191.74 → 2194.02] How have I been maturing
[2194.02 → 2195.32] In my faith
[2195.32 → 2196.80] Over the past years
[2196.80 → 2198.32] Well this morning
[2198.32 → 2199.74] We are going to reflect
[2199.74 → 2200.86] Really on what it means
[2200.86 → 2202.94] To mature within our faith
[2202.94 → 2204.24] What are some of the words
[2204.24 → 2205.32] Or metrics
[2205.32 → 2206.66] Or what is a lens
[2206.66 → 2207.74] That we can use
[2207.74 → 2210.16] To reflect on our own faith
[2210.16 → 2212.04] And if there's one book
[2212.04 → 2212.58] In the Bible
[2212.58 → 2213.90] That kind of helps us
[2213.90 → 2214.52] To do this
[2214.52 → 2215.42] Which talks to us
[2215.42 → 2216.62] About maturing in our faith
[2216.62 → 2218.90] It is the letter of Colossians
[2218.90 → 2220.76] Written by the apostle Paul
[2220.76 → 2221.94] And if there's one passage
[2221.94 → 2223.12] That kind of summarizes
[2223.12 → 2224.16] This book
[2224.16 → 2225.14] It is this passage
[2225.14 → 2226.36] From Colossians 2
[2226.36 → 2227.94] Verses 6 to 7
[2227.94 → 2229.02] Which is our passage
[2229.02 → 2229.66] This morning
[2229.66 → 2231.66] You can follow along with me
[2231.66 → 2232.98] This is what it says
[2232.98 → 2234.10] It says
[2234.10 → 2234.76] So then
[2234.76 → 2236.48] Just as you received
[2236.48 → 2238.16] Christ Jesus as Lord
[2238.16 → 2239.78] Continue to live
[2239.78 → 2240.94] Your lives in him
[2240.94 → 2242.72] Rooted and built up
[2242.72 → 2243.30] In him
[2243.30 → 2244.96] Strengthened in the faith
[2244.96 → 2245.88] As you were taught
[2245.88 → 2247.48] And overflowing
[2247.48 → 2248.66] With thankfulness
[2248.66 → 2250.72] This is the word of the Lord
[2250.72 → 2252.60] Thank you so much
[2252.60 → 2254.40] Brothers and sisters
[2254.40 → 2255.06] To mature
[2255.06 → 2257.12] As believers in Christ
[2257.12 → 2258.54] We need to begin
[2258.54 → 2259.16] By getting
[2259.16 → 2261.36] First things first
[2261.36 → 2263.06] Paul begins our passage
[2263.06 → 2263.96] With these words
[2263.96 → 2264.76] In verse 6
[2264.76 → 2265.64] So then
[2265.64 → 2267.20] Just as you received
[2267.20 → 2269.32] Christ Jesus as Lord
[2269.32 → 2271.74] Now there's one hard truth
[2271.74 → 2273.46] We all need to learn in life
[2273.46 → 2274.18] And that is
[2274.18 → 2275.42] No matter who we are
[2275.42 → 2277.00] What faith tradition we follow
[2277.00 → 2279.28] Or whatever faith tradition
[2279.28 → 2280.06] We don't follow
[2280.06 → 2282.04] We all worship
[2282.04 → 2284.16] Or we all serve
[2284.16 → 2286.10] Something or someone
[2286.10 → 2287.84] Something is Lord
[2287.84 → 2289.10] Of all of our lives
[2289.10 → 2290.28] We are not nearly as
[2290.28 → 2291.74] In control of our lives
[2291.74 → 2292.52] And our influences
[2292.52 → 2294.32] As we often like to think
[2294.32 → 2294.82] We are
[2294.82 → 2296.06] Like the people
[2296.06 → 2296.88] Of the Old Testament
[2296.88 → 2298.24] We all have idols
[2298.24 → 2299.74] We all have things
[2299.74 → 2300.64] That we follow
[2300.64 → 2301.92] They just look
[2301.92 → 2303.00] Maybe very different
[2303.00 → 2303.52] Today
[2303.52 → 2305.78] Maybe a lord of our life
[2305.78 → 2306.54] Or maybe an idol
[2306.54 → 2307.22] Within our life
[2307.22 → 2308.26] Is control
[2308.26 → 2309.28] Or power
[2309.28 → 2310.66] Maybe it's money
[2310.66 → 2311.76] Or possessions
[2311.76 → 2313.62] Maybe as we get older
[2313.62 → 2314.34] It's health
[2314.34 → 2315.56] Or it's security
[2315.56 → 2316.96] Maybe it's prestige
[2316.96 → 2318.22] Maybe when we're younger
[2318.22 → 2319.58] Or no matter what age we are
[2319.58 → 2320.70] Maybe our new idol
[2320.70 → 2322.34] Has become our phone
[2322.34 → 2323.52] The first thing we grab
[2323.52 → 2324.14] In the morning
[2324.14 → 2325.38] Or maybe it's social media
[2325.38 → 2327.10] Or maybe it's even an emotion
[2327.10 → 2329.78] Maybe fear has become an idol
[2329.78 → 2330.82] Within our life
[2330.82 → 2332.46] There are so many things
[2332.46 → 2334.02] To distract us in this world
[2334.02 → 2335.76] So many temptations
[2335.76 → 2337.90] To find our identity in
[2337.90 → 2340.76] But if we actually want to mature
[2340.76 → 2342.10] As believers in Christ
[2342.10 → 2345.58] We need to get first things first
[2345.58 → 2347.20] And that is
[2347.20 → 2348.88] The lordship of Jesus
[2348.88 → 2350.14] In our life
[2350.14 → 2352.30] Now this sounds quite easy
[2352.30 → 2353.38] But it's actually
[2353.38 → 2354.60] The most difficult step
[2354.60 → 2356.56] Now the book of Colossians
[2356.56 → 2358.32] Tells us two very specific things
[2358.32 → 2360.42] About Jesus as Lord
[2360.42 → 2362.70] In Colossians 1 verse 15
[2362.70 → 2364.32] Paul writes
[2364.32 → 2365.98] The sun is the image
[2365.98 → 2367.28] Of the invisible God
[2367.28 → 2370.08] The firstborn over all creation
[2370.08 → 2373.68] Jesus is God
[2373.68 → 2376.44] We believe that he is the creator
[2376.44 → 2378.24] Jesus is the incarnation
[2378.24 → 2380.86] He is the physical manifestation
[2380.86 → 2382.54] Of God
[2382.54 → 2385.24] John 1 verses 1 through 3 says
[2385.24 → 2386.88] In the beginning was the word
[2386.88 → 2388.22] And the word was with God
[2388.22 → 2389.44] And the word was God
[2389.44 → 2391.16] He was with God in the beginning
[2391.16 → 2393.06] Through him all things were made
[2393.06 → 2394.70] Without him nothing was made
[2394.70 → 2396.50] That has been made
[2396.50 → 2398.92] Jesus is that word
[2398.92 → 2400.64] Jesus the man
[2400.64 → 2401.90] The historical figure
[2401.90 → 2403.62] Who walked the dusty roads
[2403.62 → 2404.46] Of the Middle East
[2404.46 → 2405.50] Who sat in boats
[2405.50 → 2406.94] Who fished for his meals
[2406.94 → 2408.14] Who ate stale bread
[2408.14 → 2409.86] And drank good wine
[2409.86 → 2412.10] He is the one who created
[2412.10 → 2413.80] All that we can see
[2413.80 → 2416.14] And feel and touch
[2416.14 → 2418.00] Again from Colossians
[2418.00 → 2420.14] Colossians 1 verse 15 and 17
[2420.14 → 2421.04] It says
[2421.04 → 2423.20] For in him all things were created
[2423.20 → 2425.08] He is before all things
[2425.08 → 2428.34] And in him all things hold together
[2428.34 → 2430.90] But not only is he the creator
[2430.90 → 2434.02] But he is also the re-creator
[2434.02 → 2435.90] He is also the redeemer
[2435.90 → 2438.04] Colossians 1 verse 18 says
[2438.04 → 2439.84] He is the beginning and the firstborn
[2439.84 → 2441.86] From among the dead
[2441.86 → 2444.48] He is the beginning of creation
[2444.48 → 2448.08] But he is also the beginning of new creation
[2448.08 → 2450.72] He is the firstborn over all creation
[2450.72 → 2452.50] But he is also the firstborn
[2452.50 → 2454.36] From among the dead
[2454.36 → 2456.92] Now this idea of being the firstborn
[2456.92 → 2458.68] Meaning he goes ahead with
[2458.68 → 2459.90] He goes ahead of us
[2459.90 → 2461.80] But he also desires for us
[2461.80 → 2462.98] To follow with him
[2462.98 → 2464.54] He desires for us to share
[2464.54 → 2465.58] Within this thing
[2465.58 → 2467.58] To share within this new kingdom
[2467.58 → 2470.02] We are invited to participate in this
[2470.02 → 2472.14] We are invited to participate in creation
[2472.14 → 2473.34] All around us
[2473.34 → 2474.84] To enjoy its beauty
[2474.84 → 2477.04] But we are also invited to participate
[2477.04 → 2478.70] In his recreation
[2478.70 → 2480.64] In his new kingdom
[2480.64 → 2483.20] Colossians 3 verses 3 to 4 says
[2483.20 → 2484.36] For you died
[2484.36 → 2485.86] And your life is now hidden
[2485.86 → 2487.28] With Christ in God
[2487.28 → 2489.90] When Christ who is your life appears
[2489.90 → 2492.96] Then you also will appear with him
[2492.96 → 2494.34] In glory
[2494.34 → 2496.90] Jesus has gone first
[2496.90 → 2499.02] And we are baptized then
[2499.02 → 2500.62] Into his death
[2500.62 → 2503.24] So that we can be raised with him
[2503.24 → 2505.04] In new life
[2505.04 → 2507.46] To receive Jesus as Lord
[2507.46 → 2509.50] We are called to die to ourselves
[2509.50 → 2511.44] To die to our idols
[2511.44 → 2514.50] In order to be born anew in him
[2514.50 → 2517.50] But the crux of this is
[2517.50 → 2519.42] Are we actually willing
[2519.42 → 2523.28] To receive this Jesus as Lord?
[2524.06 → 2526.90] Are we actually willing to die to ourselves
[2526.90 → 2528.64] To die to our own lords
[2528.64 → 2531.76] So that we can be raised anew in him?
[2532.50 → 2534.52] You see we are not Lord
[2534.52 → 2537.04] The world is not our Lord
[2537.04 → 2538.82] But Jesus we believe
[2538.82 → 2541.10] Is Lord over all
[2541.10 → 2543.82] And yet so often
[2543.82 → 2545.70] We shove this reality
[2545.70 → 2546.82] To the background
[2546.82 → 2549.08] And we make the secondary things
[2549.08 → 2550.44] The things of this world
[2550.44 → 2551.50] Money and possessions
[2551.50 → 2552.40] And power
[2552.40 → 2553.08] And politics
[2553.08 → 2553.60] And fear
[2553.60 → 2555.28] We make that the main thing
[2555.28 → 2556.86] Or we make the secondary things
[2556.86 → 2557.82] The things of the church
[2557.82 → 2558.54] The main thing
[2558.54 → 2559.44] Theology
[2559.44 → 2560.34] And doctrine
[2560.34 → 2561.08] And pastors
[2561.08 → 2562.46] And worship styles
[2562.46 → 2563.46] And church order
[2563.46 → 2564.78] We make all those things
[2564.78 → 2565.62] The main thing
[2565.62 → 2568.00] We take the secondary things
[2568.00 → 2569.34] And we so often make them
[2569.34 → 2570.72] The main thing
[2570.72 → 2573.48] But if we want to grow in our faith
[2573.48 → 2575.42] If we want to mature in our faith
[2575.42 → 2576.72] We need to come back
[2576.72 → 2578.18] Again and again
[2578.18 → 2579.68] To the cornerstone
[2579.68 → 2581.92] To Jesus Christ
[2581.92 → 2582.88] The Lord
[2582.88 → 2585.50] For that which is Lord of our life
[2585.50 → 2587.92] Will always set the direction
[2587.92 → 2589.76] For how we mature
[2589.76 → 2592.64] And for what we mature in
[2592.64 → 2594.88] Whatever is Lord of our heart
[2594.88 → 2596.24] Sets the course
[2596.24 → 2597.84] For everything else
[2597.84 → 2599.22] In our life
[2599.22 → 2601.10] Paul continues on
[2601.10 → 2601.82] In our passage
[2601.82 → 2602.60] He says
[2602.60 → 2603.64] Just as you received
[2603.64 → 2605.06] Christ Jesus as Lord
[2605.06 → 2607.10] Continue to live
[2607.10 → 2608.66] Your lives in him
[2608.66 → 2611.18] Now in this passage
[2611.18 → 2611.98] When it says
[2611.98 → 2613.36] Live your lives in him
[2613.36 → 2615.34] What Paul literally wrote there
[2615.34 → 2615.96] In the Greek
[2615.96 → 2617.98] Is the word walk
[2617.98 → 2620.58] The first half of this verse
[2620.58 → 2621.36] Is our truth
[2621.36 → 2623.22] You received Christ Jesus
[2623.22 → 2623.94] As Lord
[2623.94 → 2625.36] The second half
[2625.36 → 2626.36] Is then the command
[2626.36 → 2628.48] Now walk
[2628.48 → 2629.74] You see
[2629.74 → 2630.80] As in human nature
[2630.80 → 2631.72] Paul is picking up
[2631.72 → 2632.48] On what is innate
[2632.48 → 2633.66] In human nature
[2633.66 → 2634.36] And that is
[2634.36 → 2635.90] That there is no hiatus
[2635.90 → 2637.04] There is no break
[2637.04 → 2638.36] Between believing
[2638.36 → 2640.22] And how we behave
[2640.22 → 2641.96] Where our treasure is
[2641.96 → 2644.04] That is where our heart is
[2644.04 → 2646.38] And that will always direct
[2646.38 → 2647.26] Our legs
[2647.26 → 2648.90] Where we walk
[2648.90 → 2650.92] And in order to show us
[2650.92 → 2652.18] How we ought to walk
[2652.18 → 2652.98] Paul gives us
[2652.98 → 2654.30] Really three pieces
[2654.30 → 2655.36] Of imagery
[2655.36 → 2656.60] To kind of guide us
[2656.60 → 2657.60] To give us metrics
[2657.60 → 2659.08] For how we ought to walk
[2659.08 → 2660.62] For how we ought to mature
[2660.62 → 2661.24] In him
[2661.24 → 2662.14] Paul says
[2662.14 → 2662.82] We need to be
[2662.82 → 2664.08] Rooted like a tree
[2664.08 → 2665.38] We need to be
[2665.38 → 2667.10] Built up like a house
[2667.10 → 2668.24] And we need to be
[2668.24 → 2670.52] As strong as a law
[2670.52 → 2672.02] First he says
[2672.02 → 2674.06] Be rooted in Christ
[2674.06 → 2675.40] Now of course
[2675.40 → 2676.02] Back in the day
[2676.02 → 2676.96] When the Bible was written
[2676.96 → 2677.96] And everyone kind of had
[2677.96 → 2679.98] Some farming background
[2679.98 → 2680.94] Or some intensive
[2680.94 → 2682.48] Gardening background
[2682.48 → 2683.54] And everyone knew
[2683.54 → 2684.60] The importance
[2684.60 → 2686.52] Of good roots
[2686.52 → 2687.76] The Bible is full
[2687.76 → 2689.38] Of organic imagery
[2689.38 → 2690.12] And this idea
[2690.12 → 2691.60] Of being rooted
[2691.60 → 2692.90] All the way back
[2692.90 → 2694.00] In Psalm 1
[2694.00 → 2695.08] King David wrote
[2695.08 → 2696.32] Blessed is the one
[2696.32 → 2697.18] Who does not walk
[2697.18 → 2698.16] In step with the wicked
[2698.16 → 2699.24] But whose delight
[2699.24 → 2700.28] Is in the law
[2700.28 → 2700.96] Of the Lord
[2700.96 → 2702.28] That person is like
[2702.28 → 2703.24] A tree planted
[2703.24 → 2704.58] By streams of water
[2704.58 → 2706.06] Which yields its fruit
[2706.06 → 2706.74] In season
[2706.74 → 2707.88] And whose leaf
[2707.88 → 2709.16] Does not wither
[2709.16 → 2710.82] This is imagery
[2710.82 → 2711.46] Of a tree
[2711.46 → 2713.20] That has deep roots
[2713.20 → 2713.92] That is planted
[2713.92 → 2715.20] By a beautiful stream
[2715.20 → 2716.76] Of living water
[2716.76 → 2717.76] And this tree
[2717.76 → 2718.56] Is pulling up
[2718.56 → 2719.44] From that stream
[2719.44 → 2720.06] Pulling up
[2720.06 → 2721.46] From that living water
[2721.46 → 2722.16] It's water
[2722.16 → 2723.18] And it's nutrients
[2723.18 → 2724.22] For life
[2724.22 → 2725.96] See as we all know
[2725.96 → 2726.90] It is only because
[2726.90 → 2728.04] Of a root system
[2728.04 → 2729.02] That a tree
[2729.02 → 2729.74] Can actually produce
[2730.26 → 2731.12] Anything
[2731.12 → 2732.72] Now if there's
[2732.72 → 2733.92] Any environmentalists
[2733.92 → 2734.82] Here this morning
[2734.82 → 2735.52] You can kind of
[2735.52 → 2735.94] Shut out
[2735.94 → 2737.62] This next story
[2737.62 → 2738.20] I'm going to tell
[2738.20 → 2739.22] But about a year
[2739.22 → 2739.88] And a half ago
[2739.88 → 2740.62] My wife Carrie
[2740.62 → 2741.08] And I moved
[2741.08 → 2741.66] Into the house
[2741.66 → 2742.48] Where we're currently
[2742.48 → 2742.82] Living
[2742.82 → 2743.96] And it's a beautiful
[2743.96 → 2744.50] Backyard
[2744.50 → 2745.36] It's a small backyard
[2745.36 → 2745.92] But it's a very
[2745.92 → 2747.38] Beautiful backyard
[2747.38 → 2748.66] But when we moved in
[2748.66 → 2750.52] There were two grapevines
[2750.52 → 2751.64] Growing in there
[2751.64 → 2752.22] And I don't know
[2752.22 → 2752.58] About you
[2752.58 → 2753.16] But I don't really
[2753.16 → 2753.76] Have any time
[2753.76 → 2755.02] For grapevines
[2755.02 → 2756.84] And we admired them
[2756.84 → 2757.66] For most of the summer
[2757.66 → 2758.42] Last year
[2758.42 → 2759.52] But then they started
[2759.52 → 2760.72] Getting a bit ornery
[2760.72 → 2761.20] And they started
[2761.20 → 2762.10] Kind of growing
[2762.10 → 2762.96] Into our shed
[2762.96 → 2763.72] And getting under
[2763.72 → 2764.28] The siding
[2764.28 → 2765.60] And sticking to the roof
[2765.60 → 2766.50] And getting under
[2766.50 → 2767.04] The eaves
[2767.04 → 2768.28] And into the shed
[2768.28 → 2768.92] And so at the end
[2768.92 → 2769.38] Of the summer
[2769.38 → 2770.08] We kind of said
[2770.08 → 2771.30] Okay enough is enough
[2771.30 → 2773.10] Grapevines gotta go
[2773.10 → 2774.28] So we got the shears out
[2774.28 → 2774.94] And we pruned them
[2774.94 → 2775.54] All the way back
[2775.54 → 2776.76] To just two little stubbies
[2776.76 → 2778.48] And I was
[2778.48 → 2779.42] In my optimism
[2779.42 → 2780.64] We were going
[2780.64 → 2781.36] Into the fall
[2781.36 → 2782.20] And I was kind of hoping
[2782.20 → 2782.76] Well maybe
[2782.76 → 2783.56] You know
[2783.56 → 2784.66] They'll grow some mould
[2784.66 → 2785.46] Or they'll start
[2785.46 → 2786.58] Rotting over the summer
[2786.58 → 2787.66] Or over the winter
[2787.66 → 2788.64] And they'll just disappear
[2788.64 → 2790.66] Well unfortunately
[2790.66 → 2791.18] Of course
[2791.18 → 2792.02] This spring
[2792.02 → 2792.90] Sure enough
[2792.90 → 2794.60] The roots shot up
[2794.60 → 2795.28] And these green
[2795.28 → 2796.54] Green things started growing
[2796.54 → 2797.72] And in late May
[2797.72 → 2798.42] We had to move out
[2798.42 → 2798.88] Of our house
[2798.88 → 2799.70] Because of a renovation
[2799.70 → 2800.86] And so we were living out
[2800.86 → 2801.94] In Abbotsford
[2801.94 → 2803.08] At Carrie's parents' place
[2803.08 → 2803.98] And when we moved back
[2803.98 → 2805.32] Those little stubbies
[2805.32 → 2806.48] Had grown to huge shoots
[2806.48 → 2807.10] Like that
[2807.10 → 2807.54] And so
[2807.54 → 2809.02] It was busy at the time
[2809.02 → 2809.88] And, so I was mowing
[2809.88 → 2810.66] The lawn one day
[2810.66 → 2811.42] And I got angry
[2811.42 → 2812.46] And I just took the lawnmower
[2812.46 → 2814.44] And I went over those shoots
[2814.44 → 2815.74] And they were disappeared
[2815.74 → 2816.38] They were gone
[2816.38 → 2817.78] And then after that
[2817.78 → 2818.44] As many of you know
[2818.44 → 2819.16] I ended up in hospital
[2819.16 → 2819.94] For a couple of weeks
[2819.94 → 2821.16] And as I got weaker
[2821.16 → 2822.06] And weaker in hospital
[2822.06 → 2823.28] These shoots back at home
[2823.28 → 2824.58] Just got stronger and stronger
[2824.58 → 2826.86] And I was so weak
[2826.86 → 2827.80] That I kind of cut them
[2827.80 → 2829.00] One day when I got home
[2829.00 → 2829.40] And then
[2829.40 → 2830.94] You can turn the camera off
[2830.94 → 2831.50] For this part
[2831.50 → 2832.96] Took some roundup
[2832.96 → 2834.40] I dosed those things
[2834.40 → 2834.92] In roundup
[2834.92 → 2836.04] I was just so sick of them
[2836.04 → 2837.10] But roundup's not
[2837.10 → 2837.78] What it used to be
[2837.78 → 2838.94] And sure enough
[2838.94 → 2839.68] It knocked them back
[2839.68 → 2840.48] For about six weeks
[2840.48 → 2841.24] But the end of August
[2841.24 → 2841.98] Wouldn't you know it
[2841.98 → 2843.24] Green little shoots
[2843.24 → 2844.26] Started coming back
[2844.26 → 2845.86] By that time
[2845.86 → 2846.56] I was strong enough
[2846.56 → 2847.10] I got the pick
[2847.10 → 2847.72] I got the shovel
[2847.72 → 2849.40] And uprooted those things
[2849.40 → 2850.30] Hopefully
[2850.30 → 2852.32] Once and for all
[2852.32 → 2855.12] But you see
[2855.12 → 2855.70] When something is
[2855.70 → 2856.94] Properly rooted
[2856.94 → 2858.28] It's almost impossible
[2858.28 → 2859.68] To kill it
[2859.68 → 2861.60] And so we have to ask
[2861.60 → 2863.72] Where are we rooted
[2863.72 → 2865.56] What is influencing
[2865.56 → 2867.26] What is it that is
[2867.26 → 2868.30] Feeding our life
[2868.30 → 2869.82] Feeding our soul
[2869.82 → 2871.54] Even Jesus gets to this
[2871.54 → 2872.54] In John 15
[2872.54 → 2873.34] Where he says
[2873.34 → 2874.24] I am the vine
[2874.24 → 2875.28] And you are the branches
[2875.28 → 2876.86] If you remain in me
[2876.86 → 2877.72] And I in you
[2877.72 → 2878.90] You will bear much fruit
[2878.90 → 2880.24] But apart from me
[2880.24 → 2881.10] You can do nothing
[2881.10 → 2882.44] You see
[2882.44 → 2883.60] To grow in maturity
[2883.60 → 2884.94] We need to be rooted
[2884.94 → 2886.76] In the right stuff
[2886.76 → 2888.98] Rooted in Christ
[2888.98 → 2891.16] For without proper rooting
[2891.16 → 2892.36] We will only grow
[2892.36 → 2893.80] Into deformity
[2893.80 → 2894.96] Within our faith
[2894.96 → 2896.76] Hurting ourselves
[2896.76 → 2898.88] And more often times
[2898.88 → 2900.50] Hurting others
[2900.50 → 2902.02] We need to be rooted
[2902.02 → 2903.78] In the centrality of Christ
[2903.78 → 2905.00] In his love
[2905.00 → 2906.30] In his grace
[2906.30 → 2907.66] In his salvation
[2907.66 → 2909.66] The second imagery
[2909.66 → 2910.20] We are given
[2910.20 → 2911.08] Is that we need to be
[2911.08 → 2912.72] Built up in Christ
[2912.72 → 2913.24] For you see
[2913.24 → 2914.10] Just as we are all
[2914.10 → 2915.46] Rooted and being fed
[2915.46 → 2916.04] By something
[2916.04 → 2916.62] So too
[2916.62 → 2917.48] We are all
[2917.48 → 2918.62] Building something
[2918.62 → 2919.64] In life
[2919.64 → 2921.20] 1 Corinthians 3
[2921.20 → 2922.00] Paul writes
[2922.00 → 2923.52] You are God's field
[2923.52 → 2924.42] God's building
[2924.42 → 2925.38] But each of you
[2925.38 → 2926.50] Should build with care
[2926.50 → 2927.66] For no one can lay
[2927.66 → 2928.48] Any foundation
[2928.48 → 2929.36] Other than the one
[2929.36 → 2930.12] Already laid
[2930.12 → 2931.78] Which is Jesus Christ
[2931.78 → 2932.94] Don't you know
[2932.94 → 2933.74] That you yourself
[2933.74 → 2934.60] Are God's temple
[2934.60 → 2935.84] And that God's spirit
[2935.84 → 2937.88] Dwells in your midst
[2937.88 → 2939.82] See we are all
[2939.82 → 2940.80] Building something
[2940.80 → 2942.42] Within our life
[2942.42 → 2943.40] And even if you are
[2943.40 → 2944.18] In a place in life
[2944.18 → 2944.78] Where it feels
[2944.78 → 2945.40] That the years
[2945.40 → 2946.78] Are just slipping by
[2946.78 → 2947.78] You have young kids
[2947.78 → 2948.52] Or older kids
[2948.52 → 2948.96] In school
[2948.96 → 2949.46] And the years
[2949.46 → 2950.28] Are just slipping by
[2950.28 → 2951.14] This is especially
[2951.14 → 2952.58] A time to ask yourself
[2952.58 → 2953.14] And to stop
[2953.14 → 2954.16] What is it
[2954.16 → 2955.26] That we are building
[2955.26 → 2955.92] What is it
[2955.92 → 2957.36] That I am building
[2957.36 → 2958.76] Am I just building
[2958.76 → 2959.96] Something in this life
[2959.96 → 2960.76] For this world
[2960.76 → 2961.42] For myself
[2961.42 → 2962.76] Or for my family
[2962.76 → 2964.80] What are we building in
[2964.80 → 2966.74] Jesus even reminds us
[2966.74 → 2967.66] In Matthew 6
[2967.66 → 2968.32] He says
[2968.32 → 2969.80] But store up for yourself
[2969.80 → 2970.78] Treasures in heaven
[2970.78 → 2972.20] Where moths and vermin
[2972.20 → 2973.06] Do not destroy
[2973.06 → 2974.18] And where thieves
[2974.18 → 2975.20] Do not break in
[2975.20 → 2976.30] And steal
[2976.30 → 2978.14] See it is good
[2978.14 → 2979.38] To build homes
[2979.38 → 2980.18] It's good
[2980.18 → 2981.48] To build families
[2981.48 → 2982.46] To build jobs
[2982.46 → 2983.54] To build careers
[2983.54 → 2984.98] These are all good things
[2984.98 → 2987.00] But are we building them up
[2987.00 → 2988.36] In Christ
[2988.36 → 2989.30] In his holiness
[2989.30 → 2990.64] In his righteousness
[2990.64 → 2991.88] Are we not
[2991.88 → 2993.48] And not losing perspective
[2993.48 → 2994.26] On why
[2994.26 → 2995.76] We actually do
[2995.76 → 2996.80] What we do
[2996.80 → 2998.86] The third imagery
[2998.86 → 3000.56] That Paul gives us
[3000.56 → 3001.28] Is we are to be
[3001.28 → 3001.92] Strengthened
[3001.92 → 3003.00] In Christ
[3003.00 → 3004.00] Now the word
[3004.00 → 3004.76] Strengthened
[3004.76 → 3005.76] That Paul uses
[3005.76 → 3006.32] In the Greek
[3006.32 → 3007.46] Actually has
[3007.46 → 3009.28] Legal connotations
[3009.28 → 3009.90] To it
[3009.90 → 3010.74] Meaning that
[3010.74 → 3011.74] What he is saying
[3011.74 → 3012.82] Is Paul is saying
[3012.82 → 3014.46] Be as confirmed
[3014.46 → 3016.36] Be as binding
[3016.36 → 3018.36] Be as established
[3018.36 → 3020.36] As a legal document
[3020.64 → 3022.42] Something that can't
[3022.42 → 3023.54] Just be broken
[3023.54 → 3026.08] Now this doesn't mean
[3026.08 → 3027.26] We need to remove
[3027.26 → 3028.14] All doubt
[3028.14 → 3030.08] Or we need to be dogmatic
[3030.08 → 3031.50] Or we are unwilling
[3031.50 → 3033.02] To listen to anyone else
[3033.02 → 3034.64] Or any other opinion
[3034.64 → 3035.92] In fact
[3035.92 → 3036.88] Strengthening
[3036.88 → 3038.52] Often times begins
[3038.52 → 3039.88] With questioning
[3039.88 → 3041.12] Questioning
[3041.12 → 3042.16] Where are we
[3042.16 → 3043.06] What have I been
[3043.06 → 3044.06] Listening to
[3044.06 → 3045.00] What are the stories
[3045.00 → 3046.34] That I am being told
[3046.34 → 3047.56] What is it that I am building
[3047.56 → 3048.16] What is it
[3048.16 → 3049.64] That is actually feeding me
[3049.64 → 3051.04] Like a concrete building
[3051.04 → 3052.34] We need to be tested
[3052.34 → 3054.12] And always retested
[3054.12 → 3055.74] Even John talks about this
[3055.74 → 3056.06] Where he says
[3056.06 → 3057.56] Test the spirits
[3057.56 → 3059.52] Of the time
[3059.52 → 3061.06] Paul writes in
[3061.06 → 3061.76] Colossians 2
[3061.76 → 3062.82] Verse 23
[3062.82 → 3063.20] He says
[3063.20 → 3064.74] Be established and firm
[3064.74 → 3065.66] Do not move
[3065.66 → 3066.28] From the hope
[3066.28 → 3067.52] Held out in the gospel
[3067.52 → 3068.60] Be strengthened
[3068.60 → 3069.56] With all power
[3069.56 → 3070.64] According to his
[3070.64 → 3071.54] Glorious might
[3071.54 → 3072.38] So that you may have
[3072.38 → 3073.26] Great endurance
[3073.26 → 3074.04] And patience
[3074.04 → 3075.46] The imagery
[3075.46 → 3076.14] That I kind of
[3076.14 → 3077.12] That pops into my head
[3077.12 → 3078.18] When I read these
[3078.18 → 3079.58] Is the image of steel
[3079.58 → 3080.24] Or iron
[3080.24 → 3081.22] Being refined
[3081.22 → 3081.94] In the fire
[3081.94 → 3083.26] For metals
[3083.26 → 3084.28] To be hardened
[3084.28 → 3085.20] They have to go through
[3085.20 → 3087.50] Incredibly hot temperatures
[3087.50 → 3088.66] To be formed
[3088.66 → 3089.34] And moulded
[3089.34 → 3090.12] In the right way
[3090.12 → 3091.74] But also to burn off
[3091.74 → 3092.42] To get rid of
[3092.42 → 3093.44] The impurities
[3093.44 → 3094.48] So that they can
[3094.48 → 3095.40] Eventually handle
[3095.40 → 3095.96] The weight
[3095.96 → 3097.02] And the stress
[3097.02 → 3098.00] That will be placed
[3098.00 → 3098.86] On them
[3098.86 → 3099.94] So that they can
[3099.94 → 3100.84] In that beautiful
[3100.84 → 3101.66] Biblical word
[3101.66 → 3102.50] So they can be
[3102.50 → 3103.76] Steadfast
[3103.76 → 3105.16] In what they need
[3105.16 → 3105.64] To do
[3105.64 → 3107.22] We are called
[3107.22 → 3107.98] To endure
[3107.98 → 3108.92] In the face
[3108.92 → 3109.96] Of opposition
[3109.96 → 3111.16] Or hardship
[3111.16 → 3111.74] Or we're called
[3111.74 → 3112.36] To endure
[3112.36 → 3113.76] In the face
[3113.76 → 3116.06] Of very boring times
[3116.06 → 3117.32] And life in church
[3117.32 → 3118.72] Can be boring
[3118.72 → 3119.68] I can say that
[3119.68 → 3120.18] As a pastor
[3120.18 → 3120.90] Because it can be
[3120.90 → 3122.40] We are called
[3122.40 → 3123.36] To choose
[3123.36 → 3124.94] To persevere
[3124.94 → 3125.82] In the hope
[3125.82 → 3127.32] Of the gospel
[3127.32 → 3130.54] Now there's
[3130.54 → 3131.40] An interesting thing
[3131.40 → 3133.16] Excuse me
[3133.16 → 3133.82] There's an interesting
[3133.82 → 3134.76] Thing that's kind of
[3134.76 → 3135.66] Happening with these
[3135.66 → 3137.04] Three images
[3137.04 → 3138.20] An interesting thing
[3138.20 → 3138.74] That's happening
[3138.74 → 3139.38] In the Greek
[3139.38 → 3140.78] That doesn't translate
[3140.78 → 3141.52] As obvious
[3141.52 → 3142.70] Within the English
[3142.70 → 3143.96] And that is that
[3143.96 → 3144.96] The word rooted
[3144.96 → 3147.02] Is in this Greek tense
[3147.02 → 3148.36] Has this idea
[3148.36 → 3149.66] Of being once
[3149.66 → 3151.00] And for all
[3151.00 → 3152.36] Whereas the words
[3152.36 → 3152.96] That are used
[3152.96 → 3154.04] For built-up
[3154.04 → 3154.82] And strengthened
[3154.82 → 3155.94] Are in this tense
[3155.94 → 3156.76] Have this idea
[3156.76 → 3158.58] Of being continual
[3158.58 → 3159.98] You see we need
[3159.98 → 3160.86] To be rooted
[3160.86 → 3161.78] In the lordship
[3161.78 → 3162.98] Of Christ once
[3162.98 → 3164.56] And for all
[3164.56 → 3165.58] Rooted in that
[3165.58 → 3166.72] One safe
[3166.72 → 3168.26] Same place
[3168.26 → 3169.70] Everything in our faith
[3169.70 → 3170.70] Is built on
[3170.70 → 3171.64] That rootedness
[3171.64 → 3172.48] We are rooted
[3172.48 → 3173.50] In our baptism
[3173.50 → 3174.30] And rooted
[3174.30 → 3175.12] In our profession
[3175.12 → 3175.86] Of faith
[3175.86 → 3176.76] Rooted in our
[3176.76 → 3177.92] Relationship with
[3177.92 → 3178.64] Jesus
[3178.64 → 3180.40] In that one spot
[3180.40 → 3182.90] But the building up
[3182.90 → 3184.16] And the strengthening
[3184.16 → 3186.60] Is always continuous
[3186.60 → 3188.54] And there are two reasons
[3188.54 → 3189.22] For this
[3189.22 → 3190.56] The first is that
[3190.56 → 3191.76] We are always called
[3191.76 → 3192.76] We are always called
[3192.76 → 3194.18] To always be learning
[3194.18 → 3196.20] And growing in the spirit
[3196.20 → 3197.82] Our learning is never done
[3197.82 → 3199.54] No matter what our age is
[3199.54 → 3200.72] I remember sitting
[3200.72 → 3201.32] With my grandma
[3201.32 → 3202.10] Over at Elam
[3202.10 → 3202.78] In the last year
[3202.78 → 3203.36] Of her life
[3203.36 → 3204.58] And she was telling me
[3204.58 → 3205.52] In one visit
[3205.52 → 3206.62] About the new awareness
[3206.62 → 3207.42] She was having
[3207.42 → 3208.36] Of Jesus
[3208.36 → 3210.76] Even at her advanced age
[3210.76 → 3212.08] In the final year
[3212.08 → 3213.16] Of my OPA's life
[3213.16 → 3214.22] He talked to my uncle
[3214.22 → 3214.68] One time
[3214.68 → 3216.06] About that he finds himself
[3216.06 → 3217.08] Meditating more
[3217.08 → 3217.74] On scripture
[3217.74 → 3219.04] And if you know my OPA
[3219.04 → 3219.68] I don't think he ever
[3219.68 → 3220.46] Used that word once
[3220.46 → 3221.02] In his life
[3221.02 → 3222.54] Until his final year
[3222.54 → 3223.68] This word meditating
[3223.68 → 3225.48] He was spending more time
[3225.48 → 3226.10] Meditating
[3226.10 → 3227.54] Even at that age
[3227.54 → 3230.16] But there's another reason
[3230.16 → 3231.50] That I believe this
[3231.50 → 3233.04] These words for building
[3233.04 → 3233.78] And strengthening
[3233.78 → 3234.56] Are continuous
[3234.56 → 3235.88] And that is
[3235.88 → 3236.68] Brothers and sisters
[3236.68 → 3237.88] Because as we all know
[3237.88 → 3239.54] We live in a very
[3239.54 → 3240.64] Broken world
[3240.64 → 3242.58] And that sometimes
[3242.58 → 3243.52] In this world
[3243.52 → 3245.36] Life blows up
[3245.36 → 3247.62] Sometimes buildings
[3247.62 → 3249.16] Are torn down
[3249.16 → 3250.88] Sometimes the centre
[3250.88 → 3252.82] Just can't hold
[3252.82 → 3254.26] Sometimes things
[3254.26 → 3255.90] Happen to us in life
[3255.90 → 3256.92] Which cause us
[3256.92 → 3258.24] To have to start over
[3258.24 → 3259.74] That have to rebuild
[3259.74 → 3260.34] That no matter
[3260.34 → 3261.60] How strong we have built
[3261.60 → 3262.50] Or how strong
[3262.50 → 3263.60] We feel our faith is
[3263.60 → 3264.54] Sometimes still
[3264.54 → 3266.18] Our knees are taken out
[3266.18 → 3267.02] From under us
[3267.02 → 3269.20] As many of you know
[3269.20 → 3270.22] Four and a half years ago
[3270.22 → 3271.18] I lost my wife
[3271.18 → 3271.94] To cancer
[3271.94 → 3275.38] Sometimes things happen
[3275.38 → 3276.24] In life
[3276.24 → 3277.04] That nothing
[3277.04 → 3278.74] Can prepare us for
[3278.74 → 3280.74] An image that I often
[3280.74 → 3282.04] Used to describe myself
[3282.04 → 3282.80] During that time
[3282.80 → 3283.74] As I felt that I was
[3283.74 → 3285.16] A bombed out building
[3285.16 → 3286.40] A building you sometimes
[3286.40 → 3287.16] See on the news
[3287.16 → 3288.20] Where half the building
[3288.20 → 3289.68] Is just gone
[3289.68 → 3291.84] And you can see through
[3291.84 → 3292.88] What's left standing
[3292.88 → 3293.96] This hollow shell
[3293.96 → 3294.78] Of a building
[3294.78 → 3295.64] You can kind of see
[3295.64 → 3296.94] Through each floor
[3296.94 → 3297.70] And there's concrete
[3297.70 → 3298.56] Just hanging down
[3298.56 → 3299.30] From rebar
[3299.30 → 3300.20] And there's plumbing
[3300.20 → 3301.74] And wires just sticking
[3301.74 → 3302.74] Out into midair
[3302.74 → 3303.70] And there's paper
[3303.70 → 3304.52] Just fluttering
[3304.52 → 3306.86] In the absolute silence
[3306.86 → 3309.38] For me this is why
[3309.38 → 3310.40] I resigned from being
[3310.40 → 3310.98] A pastor
[3310.98 → 3311.54] Because I knew
[3311.54 → 3312.98] Not only emotionally
[3312.98 → 3313.66] And physically
[3313.66 → 3314.42] Was I unable
[3314.42 → 3315.68] To carry on
[3315.68 → 3316.68] But that I knew
[3316.68 → 3318.54] That life and faith
[3318.54 → 3319.58] Were never going
[3319.58 → 3320.96] To be the same again
[3320.96 → 3322.44] That if God
[3322.44 → 3324.02] Was going to rebuild
[3324.02 → 3324.80] Within me
[3324.80 → 3325.48] It would look
[3325.48 → 3326.62] Very different
[3326.62 → 3327.48] It would be a very
[3327.48 → 3328.78] Different building
[3328.78 → 3329.74] I wouldn't be
[3329.74 → 3330.74] The same person
[3330.74 → 3332.40] You see
[3332.40 → 3332.80] There are things
[3332.80 → 3333.38] That sometimes
[3333.38 → 3334.34] Happen in life
[3334.34 → 3335.56] That change us
[3335.56 → 3336.18] Forever
[3336.18 → 3337.82] But the truth
[3337.82 → 3338.46] Also is
[3338.46 → 3339.70] That God
[3339.70 → 3340.70] Is always
[3340.70 → 3341.48] Building
[3341.48 → 3342.92] He is always
[3342.92 → 3344.02] Strengthening
[3344.02 → 3345.24] It is
[3345.24 → 3346.32] Continuous
[3346.32 → 3347.68] The roots
[3347.68 → 3349.44] Stay the same
[3349.44 → 3350.86] Jesus Christ
[3350.86 → 3351.86] His grace
[3351.86 → 3352.78] His love
[3352.78 → 3353.78] His mercy
[3353.78 → 3355.08] His desire
[3355.08 → 3355.70] And willingness
[3355.70 → 3356.74] To sit with us
[3356.74 → 3357.98] Even in the ashes
[3357.98 → 3358.92] Of that building
[3358.92 → 3360.14] Even in the ashes
[3360.14 → 3360.92] Of our heart
[3360.92 → 3361.88] The ashes even
[3361.88 → 3363.20] Of our faith
[3363.20 → 3364.66] The roots
[3364.66 → 3365.98] Are never changing
[3365.98 → 3367.24] They are our comfort
[3367.24 → 3368.58] And often times
[3368.58 → 3369.22] They are all
[3369.22 → 3369.96] That is left
[3369.96 → 3370.84] When the tree
[3370.84 → 3371.64] Of life
[3371.64 → 3372.92] Is chopped down
[3372.92 → 3375.54] But Christ's work
[3375.54 → 3376.44] Of building
[3376.44 → 3377.84] And strengthening
[3377.84 → 3379.94] Is continuous
[3379.94 → 3381.82] For he is always
[3381.82 → 3382.84] Forming
[3382.84 → 3383.74] And reforming
[3383.74 → 3385.50] Continually
[3385.50 → 3386.22] In him
[3386.22 → 3387.16] Even
[3387.16 → 3389.04] And often times
[3389.04 → 3389.82] Out of
[3389.82 → 3391.00] Our brokenness
[3391.00 → 3392.12] You see
[3392.12 → 3392.98] Our walk of faith
[3392.98 → 3394.16] Our walk of maturity
[3394.16 → 3395.42] Is never linear
[3395.42 → 3396.20] It's never simply
[3396.20 → 3396.96] From point A
[3396.96 → 3398.02] To point B
[3398.02 → 3398.90] But sometimes
[3398.90 → 3399.52] It goes up
[3399.52 → 3400.18] And sometimes
[3400.18 → 3400.82] It goes down
[3400.82 → 3401.30] And sometimes
[3401.30 → 3401.94] It just goes
[3401.94 → 3403.14] All over the place
[3403.14 → 3403.62] And sometimes
[3403.62 → 3405.06] It comes to a total halt
[3405.06 → 3406.30] And sometimes
[3406.30 → 3407.12] We're even knocked
[3407.12 → 3408.44] All the way back
[3408.44 → 3409.48] Off our heels
[3409.48 → 3412.04] But God is always
[3412.04 → 3412.88] Forming
[3412.88 → 3414.04] And creating
[3414.04 → 3415.26] He is always
[3415.26 → 3416.54] Reforming
[3416.54 → 3417.96] And recreating
[3417.96 → 3419.32] This is the strength
[3419.32 → 3420.64] Of our reformed
[3420.64 → 3421.70] Tradition
[3421.70 → 3422.86] That we dig
[3422.86 → 3423.80] Our roots deep
[3423.80 → 3424.46] In him
[3424.46 → 3425.28] And we know
[3425.28 → 3426.06] That when we do this
[3426.06 → 3426.64] He will never
[3426.64 → 3427.62] Let us go
[3427.62 → 3428.94] That Jesus Christ
[3428.94 → 3429.50] His Lord
[3429.50 → 3430.34] That his grace
[3430.34 → 3431.28] And his love
[3431.28 → 3432.74] Are ever present
[3432.74 → 3434.06] This doesn't give us
[3434.06 → 3434.42] Of course
[3434.42 → 3435.66] This doesn't give us
[3435.66 → 3436.08] Of course
[3436.08 → 3436.90] A free pass
[3436.90 → 3437.56] From the wrestling
[3437.56 → 3438.48] And the sufferings
[3438.48 → 3439.56] And the brokenness
[3439.56 → 3440.04] Of life
[3440.04 → 3441.30] But it reminds us
[3441.30 → 3442.60] That our circumstances
[3442.60 → 3443.76] In life
[3443.76 → 3445.56] Are not our Lord
[3445.56 → 3447.20] Our hardships
[3447.20 → 3448.54] Are not our Lord
[3448.54 → 3449.66] This world
[3449.66 → 3451.34] Is not our Lord
[3451.34 → 3452.36] But the one
[3452.36 → 3453.48] Who created all
[3453.48 → 3454.46] And the one
[3454.46 → 3455.70] Who redeems all
[3455.70 → 3457.52] He is Lord
[3457.52 → 3460.62] And when we allow
[3460.62 → 3461.48] Ourselves to be
[3461.48 → 3462.22] Opened up
[3462.22 → 3463.22] To receive
[3463.22 → 3464.18] This work
[3464.18 → 3465.16] This work
[3465.16 → 3466.10] Of our creator
[3466.10 → 3467.46] And re-creator
[3467.46 → 3468.36] This work
[3468.36 → 3469.20] Of the firstborn
[3469.20 → 3469.88] Of creation
[3469.88 → 3470.78] And the firstborn
[3470.78 → 3471.76] From among the dead
[3471.76 → 3473.50] Than the final phrase
[3473.50 → 3474.36] Of our passage
[3474.36 → 3475.28] Can then come
[3475.28 → 3476.64] To fruition
[3476.64 → 3478.08] Where Paul writes
[3478.08 → 3478.84] In verse 7
[3478.84 → 3480.44] Continue to live
[3480.44 → 3481.54] Your lives in him
[3481.54 → 3483.18] Overflowing
[3483.18 → 3485.18] With thankfulness
[3485.18 → 3487.48] For you see
[3487.48 → 3488.28] Brothers and sisters
[3488.28 → 3489.94] It is thankfulness
[3489.94 → 3491.62] That is the hallmark
[3491.62 → 3492.66] Of a life
[3492.66 → 3493.68] That is maturing
[3493.68 → 3495.06] In Christ
[3495.06 → 3497.14] That when we receive
[3497.14 → 3498.68] Jesus as the Lord
[3498.68 → 3499.32] Of our life
[3499.32 → 3500.12] When we are rooted
[3500.12 → 3501.02] Built up
[3501.02 → 3501.66] And strengthened
[3501.66 → 3502.22] In him
[3502.22 → 3503.66] Then gratitude
[3503.66 → 3505.54] Ought to define us
[3505.54 → 3506.60] As professing
[3506.60 → 3508.26] And baptize Christians
[3508.26 → 3509.36] In him
[3509.36 → 3511.00] But again
[3511.00 → 3512.16] This is not a gratitude
[3512.16 → 3513.44] That is based
[3513.44 → 3514.96] Simply on ourselves
[3514.96 → 3516.46] It is not a gratitude
[3516.46 → 3517.48] Based necessarily
[3517.48 → 3518.64] On our circumstances
[3518.64 → 3520.28] Or what we have done
[3520.28 → 3521.40] But it is based
[3521.40 → 3522.90] In the greatest work
[3522.90 → 3523.70] That Christ
[3523.70 → 3524.58] Has done
[3524.58 → 3525.34] For us
[3525.34 → 3526.74] Colossians 1
[3526.74 → 3528.02] 13 and 21
[3528.02 → 3529.00] Where it says
[3529.00 → 3530.14] For he has rescued us
[3530.14 → 3530.92] From the dominion
[3530.92 → 3531.58] Of darkness
[3531.58 → 3532.84] Once you were
[3532.84 → 3534.04] Alienated from God
[3534.04 → 3534.94] But now
[3534.94 → 3536.22] He has reconciled you
[3536.22 → 3537.74] By Christ's physical body
[3537.74 → 3538.46] Through death
[3538.46 → 3539.72] To present you
[3539.72 → 3540.12] Holy
[3540.12 → 3541.80] In his sight
[3541.80 → 3544.50] This is where
[3544.50 → 3546.18] Mature faith leads
[3546.18 → 3547.56] To gratitude
[3547.56 → 3549.08] To worship
[3549.08 → 3550.32] For what Christ
[3550.32 → 3551.88] Has done for us
[3551.88 → 3553.24] For his love
[3553.24 → 3554.98] And for his grace
[3554.98 → 3556.74] On the cross
[3556.74 → 3558.58] He has reconciled us
[3558.58 → 3559.44] To himself
[3559.44 → 3560.92] So that in the eyes
[3560.92 → 3561.56] Of God
[3561.56 → 3563.00] We are all
[3563.00 → 3564.18] Already
[3564.18 → 3565.38] Holy
[3565.38 → 3566.66] And sacred
[3566.66 → 3569.00] In his sight
[3569.00 → 3571.84] You see friends
[3571.84 → 3573.34] Maturing in faith
[3573.34 → 3574.68] Is really about seeing
[3574.68 → 3576.66] That life is not so much
[3576.66 → 3577.34] About us
[3577.34 → 3579.02] At all
[3579.02 → 3580.24] But it is all
[3580.24 → 3581.54] About Jesus
[3581.54 → 3582.88] That when we are
[3582.88 → 3583.74] Rooted in him
[3583.74 → 3584.98] When we are built up
[3584.98 → 3585.30] In him
[3585.30 → 3586.40] When we are strengthened
[3586.40 → 3587.22] In him
[3587.22 → 3588.78] These are the markers
[3588.78 → 3590.18] To help us reflect
[3590.18 → 3591.58] On how we grow
[3591.58 → 3592.68] And how we mature
[3592.68 → 3594.08] Within the faith
[3594.08 → 3595.24] And of course
[3595.24 → 3596.38] Then the hallmark
[3596.38 → 3597.52] Of a maturing faith
[3597.52 → 3598.88] Are we people
[3598.88 → 3599.92] Of gratitude
[3599.92 → 3602.28] Gratitude for Christ's work
[3602.28 → 3603.44] Of reconciliation
[3603.44 → 3605.64] Through the cross
[3605.64 → 3608.24] Brothers and sisters
[3608.24 → 3609.74] May the cornerstone
[3609.74 → 3611.02] Of your life
[3611.02 → 3612.34] Always be
[3612.34 → 3613.58] Jesus Christ
[3613.58 → 3614.52] Him
[3614.52 → 3615.54] And him
[3615.54 → 3616.32] Alone
[3616.32 → 3617.90] And may you walk
[3617.90 → 3618.22] Then
[3618.22 → 3619.76] Always in him
[3619.76 → 3621.20] Rooted in him
[3621.20 → 3622.78] Built up in him
[3622.78 → 3623.80] And strengthened
[3623.80 → 3624.46] In the faith
[3624.46 → 3625.34] That you were taught
[3625.34 → 3626.64] Overflowing
[3626.64 → 3628.30] Then with thankfulness
[3628.30 → 3629.92] For his incredible work
[3629.92 → 3630.80] Of reconciliation
[3630.80 → 3632.28] For you
[3632.28 → 3634.02] On the cross
[3634.02 → 3635.34] Amen
[3635.34 → 3638.28] Let us pray
[3638.28 → 3643.10] Lord Jesus
[3643.10 → 3644.62] You are Lord
[3644.62 → 3645.74] You are Lord
[3645.74 → 3646.32] Of creation
[3646.32 → 3647.10] And you are Lord
[3647.10 → 3647.82] Of recreation
[3647.82 → 3649.04] And we thank you
[3649.04 → 3649.90] That you call us
[3649.90 → 3650.64] Your children
[3650.64 → 3652.00] God help us
[3652.00 → 3652.76] In all things
[3652.76 → 3654.36] To always seek you
[3654.36 → 3655.94] To root our lives
[3655.94 → 3656.96] Deep within you
[3656.96 → 3658.06] And within your word
[3658.06 → 3659.14] So that we can also

[3661.62 → 3663.04] God so often
[3663.04 → 3663.68] We experience
[3663.68 → 3664.34] Brokenness
[3664.34 → 3664.92] In this life
[3664.92 → 3665.54] We experience
[3665.54 → 3667.02] Suffering in this life
[3667.02 → 3667.90] But we also know
[3667.90 → 3669.04] That you walk with us

[3678.18 → 3679.32] Within your faith
[3679.32 → 3680.18] That as we

[3681.34 → 3682.50] Deeper in you
[3682.50 → 3683.24] That you would
[3683.24 → 3683.78] Grow us
[3683.78 → 3684.32] And help us
[3684.32 → 3684.94] To mature
[3684.94 → 3686.14] More and more
[3686.14 → 3686.66] In you
[3686.66 → 3687.00] God
[3687.00 → 3688.24] And we worship you
[3688.24 → 3688.86] And we give you
[3688.86 → 3691.20] Thanks for Jesus Christ

[3695.58 → 3696.42] Amen
[3696.42 → 3708.02] Let's sing about the theme
[3708.02 → 3709.48] We've been hearing about
[3709.48 → 3711.36] Through the message this morning
[3711.36 → 3712.46] Let's rise and sing
[3712.46 → 3713.30] Christ alone
[3713.30 → 3727.56] In Christ alone
[3727.56 → 3730.06] My hope is found
[3730.06 → 3731.68] He is my life
[3731.68 → 3733.18] My strength
[3733.18 → 3734.30] My soul
[3734.30 → 3736.60] His cornerstone
[3736.60 → 3739.10] His solid crown
[3739.10 → 3741.12] Farmed in His sister's
[3741.12 → 3745.88] My heart of love
[3745.88 → 3747.94] My lips of peace
[3747.94 → 3750.24] When things are still
[3750.24 → 3751.44] My strength
[3751.44 → 3751.88] My confidence
[3751.88 → 3753.88] My confidence

[3757.32 → 3760.48] In the love of Christ
[3760.48 → 3761.64] I stand
[3761.64 → 3772.86] In Christ alone
[3772.86 → 3775.52] Who took on flesh
[3775.52 → 3777.08] Fullness of God
[3777.08 → 3779.64] In helpless place
[3779.64 → 3782.14] His gift of life
[3782.14 → 3783.56] In righteousness
[3783.56 → 3786.14] Stored by the ones
[3786.14 → 3788.68] He came to see
[3788.68 → 3791.18] Still on the cross
[3791.18 → 3793.22] As Jesus died
[3793.22 → 3795.50] Forever God
[3795.50 → 3797.66] Was satisfied
[3797.66 → 3800.10] For every sin
[3800.10 → 3802.50] He was made
[3802.50 → 3805.60] In the hand of Christ
[3805.60 → 3806.50] And He
[3806.50 → 3807.32] He was made
[3807.32 → 3817.88] And in the ground
[3817.88 → 3820.48] His body lay
[3820.48 → 3822.00] Light of the hope
[3822.00 → 3823.86] By darkness
[3823.86 → 3826.04] And mercy
[3826.04 → 3829.48] For His pain
[3829.48 → 3830.92] Up to the earth
[3830.92 → 3833.52] He rose again
[3833.52 → 3836.14] And as He stood
[3836.14 → 3837.52] In victory
[3837.52 → 3839.14] Sin's curse
[3839.14 → 3840.58] Has lost
[3840.58 → 3842.48] His grip on me
[3842.48 → 3844.88] For I am His
[3844.88 → 3847.28] And He is mine
[3847.28 → 3850.40] Though with the precious blood
[3850.40 → 3851.52] Of Christ
[3851.52 → 3861.72] No guilty
[3861.72 → 3862.92] Like

[3866.74 → 3868.14] Of Christ
[3868.14 → 3869.24] In me
[3869.24 → 3870.50] From Christ
[3870.50 → 3871.50] Was high
[3871.50 → 3873.90] To final breath
[3873.90 → 3874.86] Jesus
[3874.86 → 3875.54] Commends
[3875.54 → 3877.44] My destiny
[3877.44 → 3879.36] No power
[3879.36 → 3880.36] Of hell
[3880.36 → 3881.54] No scheme

[4074.94 → 4086.94] Before we go to God in our community prayer, I just wanted to mention that Mel Mass' brother-in-law, who lives in Red Deer, Alberta, passed away on Wednesday.
[4086.94 → 4091.94] So, Mel and Shirley have a great deal to deal with right now.
[4091.94 → 4102.94] Also, Art and Jerry Kulun's brother-in-law, and therefore George's uncle, passed away this past week as well, Wayne Lowe.
[4102.94 → 4104.94] Perhaps some of you know him.
[4104.94 → 4112.94] So, we offer our condolences to the Mass family and also, of course, to the Kulun family.
[4114.94 → 4118.94] Let us pray a prayer of thanksgiving in intercession.
[4118.94 → 4120.94] Please pray with me.

[4132.94 → 4133.94] Keep us rooted in you.
[4133.94 → 4140.94] And build us up, strengthening us in the hope of the gospel.
[4140.94 → 4149.94] Grateful for your gifts and mindful of the communion of your saints, we offer to you our prayers and our sacrifice of praise.
[4149.94 → 4166.94] We consider the state of the nations and cry out to you for those who suffer the ravages of war, for those who are hungry because of conflict, for those who are homeless because of the greed of others.
[4166.94 → 4179.94] We pray that all world leaders may desire peace and freedom for all people, and that our own government may contribute to solutions to these troubling world conflicts.
[4179.94 → 4185.94] We also pray for all those organizations who work to bring aid to the suffering.
[4185.94 → 4196.94] Bless, we pray, the efforts of World Renew and their partners to alleviate poverty, gender inequality, and lack of education for those in need.

[4288.94 → 4295.94] You have blessed this congregation richly, and we are thankful.
[4295.94 → 4301.94] There are those among us with special needs, those who suffer from physical ailments,
[4301.94 → 4307.94] those who care for loved ones, those who suffer silently with loneliness or depression,
[4307.94 → 4311.94] those who are weary, and those who are in mourning.
[4311.94 → 4318.94] Bless the Kulun family as they grieve the passing of Wayne Lowe, their brother-in-law and uncle.
[4318.94 → 4326.94] And also we pray especially for Mel and Shirley Mass as in their mourning for Mel's brother-in-law,
[4326.94 → 4332.94] and for both Mel and Shirley who have serious ongoing health concerns.
[4332.94 → 4338.94] We pray for Row Carter's sister Rosemary as she is in hospice.

[4360.94 → 4363.94] We are so thankful he can be here with us today.
[4363.94 → 4366.94] We pray that his healing continues.
[4366.94 → 4377.94] As we begin this week, help us to walk with Jesus, to mature in him, to reflect his love in all we do.
[4377.94 → 4387.94] All this we pray because we know you love us, and you answer prayer, Almighty God, our Redeemer and Friend.
