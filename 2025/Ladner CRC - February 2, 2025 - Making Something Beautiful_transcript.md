[350.92 --> 352.92]  Amen.
[352.92 --> 354.92]  Good morning.
[354.92 --> 356.92]  Welcome on this snowy morning.
[356.92 --> 368.92]  I'm guessing we have a few more people tuning in on YouTube than we normally do, but it's good to see all you faces here this morning who have braved the snow to get here.
[368.92 --> 376.92]  My name is Marian, and I will be one of the people on the worship team this morning, and our worship leader.
[376.92 --> 379.92]  We welcome everyone here today.
[379.92 --> 393.92]  Thank you for being here, and invite you to stay for refreshments after the service, which will this morning be in the foyer since our Chinese brothers and sisters are going to be celebrating Chinese New Year in the fellowship hall.
[393.92 --> 409.92]  So we hope you can stay and spend some time just talking together and sharing your views together.
[409.92 --> 419.92]  We especially welcome Pastor Dan Kierkegaard, who will be bringing the word this morning, and I'll say a few more words of introduction about him later before he comes up.
[419.92 --> 426.92]  We have a note of great thanks to mention today.
[426.92 --> 433.92]  Jason, Michaela, and William have welcomed a healthy, beautiful addition to their family.
[433.92 --> 438.92]  Her name is Evelyn Grace, and she arrived in good health this past Wednesday.
[438.92 --> 444.92]  So we've been praying for that for some time, and thank God for answered prayers.
[444.92 --> 451.92]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 96, as does our prayer of adoration.
[451.92 --> 454.92]  Oh, sing to the Lord a new song.
[454.92 --> 457.92]  Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[457.92 --> 459.92]  Sing to the Lord.
[459.92 --> 460.92]  Bless his name.
[460.92 --> 463.92]  Tell his salvation from day to day.
[463.92 --> 470.92]  Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
[470.92 --> 472.92]  Will you pray with me?
[472.92 --> 477.92]  Lord, you are great and greatly to be praised.
[477.92 --> 480.92]  You are to be feared above all gods.
[480.92 --> 486.92]  For all our man-made gods are idols, but you, Lord, made the heavens.
[486.92 --> 488.92]  Honor and majesty are before you.
[488.92 --> 491.92]  Strength and beauty are wherever you are.
[491.92 --> 495.92]  We come alive to your glory and strength.
[495.92 --> 498.92]  We are compelled to give you the glory you deserve.
[498.92 --> 505.92]  We come here with praise offerings to worship you in hearts that are dressed, ready to meet you.
[505.92 --> 509.92]  May all the earth bow with reverence to your greatness.
[509.92 --> 515.92]  Only you, O Lord, reign with justice, mercy, and truth.
[515.92 --> 519.92]  All glory belongs to you. Amen.
[519.92 --> 522.92]  Will you rise for God's greeting?
[525.92 --> 530.92]  God greets us with these beautiful words from Jeremiah 31 verse 3.
[530.92 --> 534.92]  I have loved you with an everlasting love.
[534.92 --> 538.92]  I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.
[538.92 --> 541.92]  Will you take a moment just to greet one another this morning?
[541.92 --> 545.92]  Will you take a moment just to greet one another this morning?
[545.92 --> 555.92]  Will you take a moment just to meet his Whoever'sótica group and threatening to draw off?
[555.92 --> 558.92]  Are they all right,這些 shows that God aims to bring the earth through and need God fromtles.
[558.92 --> 564.92]  He is cast the moment to say a moment.
[564.92 --> 594.90]  Thank you.
[594.92 --> 596.92]  Amen.
[624.92 --> 632.92]  Pavilion in splendor and girded with praise.
[634.52 --> 640.92]  Oh, tell a full day what dawn can recite.
[640.92 --> 649.12]  It breathes in the air, it shines in the light.
[649.48 --> 655.92]  It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain.
[655.92 --> 663.92]  And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.
[666.02 --> 673.24]  Frail children of dust, yet feeble as frail.
[673.24 --> 680.24]  In you do we trust, nor find you to fail.
[681.18 --> 688.46]  Your mercy's how tender, how strong to the end.
[688.72 --> 696.50]  Our maker, defender, redeemer and friend.
[696.50 --> 703.50]  Oh, my God.
[703.50 --> 714.32]  Sorry, let me try that again.
[714.32 --> 736.10]  As the deer pants for the water, so my soul walks after you.
[736.10 --> 748.10]  You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship you.
[748.10 --> 773.30]  You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship you.
[773.30 --> 782.80]  As the deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God.
[783.06 --> 785.76]  I thirst for God, the living God.
[786.44 --> 788.64]  When can I go and stand before him?
[789.20 --> 792.14]  Day and night I have only tears for food.
[792.14 --> 797.86]  While my enemies continually taunt me, saying, where is this God of yours?
[798.36 --> 799.88]  My heart is breaking.
[800.40 --> 805.20]  As I remember how it used to be, I walked among the crowds of worshipers,
[805.56 --> 808.50]  leading a great procession to the house of God,
[808.72 --> 814.82]  singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sounds of a great celebration.
[815.44 --> 816.48]  Why am I discouraged?
[817.12 --> 818.90]  Why is my heart so sad?
[819.42 --> 820.88]  I will put my hope in God.
[820.88 --> 825.06]  I will praise him yet again, my Savior and my God.
[825.80 --> 828.92]  Now I am deeply discouraged, but I will remember you.
[829.60 --> 832.88]  Even from the distant Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan,
[833.34 --> 834.78]  from the land of Mount Mizar,
[835.38 --> 841.38]  I heard the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging ties sweep over me.
[842.02 --> 845.82]  But each day the Lord pours his unfailing love upon me,
[845.82 --> 851.00]  and through each night I sing his songs, praying to God who gives me life.
[851.00 --> 853.14]  O God, my rock, I cry.
[853.50 --> 855.12]  Why have you forgotten me?
[855.80 --> 859.38]  Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?
[860.14 --> 861.80]  Their taunts break my bones.
[862.26 --> 864.48]  They scoff, where is this God of yours?
[865.12 --> 866.38]  Why am I discouraged?
[866.82 --> 868.32]  Why is my heart so sad?
[868.32 --> 869.40]  Why is my heart so sad?
[869.40 --> 869.74]  Why are you hurting?
[869.74 --> 870.12]  Why is my hope in God?
[870.42 --> 873.64]  I will praise him again, my Savior and my God.
[873.64 --> 886.32]  I want you more than gold or silver.
[886.32 --> 890.78]  Only you can satisfy.
[890.78 --> 904.88]  You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my heart.
[904.88 --> 912.34]  You alone are my strength, my shield.
[912.80 --> 919.06]  To you alone may my spirit heal.
[920.78 --> 932.92]  You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship you.
[935.42 --> 936.50]  You may be seated.
[950.78 --> 965.50]  We'll sing that in a minute.
[965.50 --> 969.74]  It just takes me a while to get organized here.
[970.36 --> 974.56]  We have a glass-top table in our living room.
[974.56 --> 986.46]  It looks pretty good most of the time, but when the sun shines directly on it, all the dust and fingerprints stand out, and you can even see the surface scratches.
[987.24 --> 989.94]  There's no denying that it's far from perfect.
[990.54 --> 994.36]  It's not too bad until the light shines on it.
[995.34 --> 998.32]  This is true for each one of us as well.
[998.32 --> 1005.66]  When we come into the holy presence of God, our own humanity is laid bare.
[1005.66 --> 1017.36]  When we stand in the living presence of the holy God, and in the living presence of truth, our own falsehood is revealed.
[1017.36 --> 1027.34]  This morning, let's be honest, admit who we are, and ask our loving, ever-present God to forgive us.
[1028.42 --> 1034.20]  Take a moment in silence to reflect and confess our sins before him.
[1034.20 --> 1034.28]  Amen.
[1034.28 --> 1034.32]  Amen.
[1034.32 --> 1034.40]  Amen.
[1034.40 --> 1034.42]  Amen.
[1034.42 --> 1034.50]  Amen.
[1034.50 --> 1034.58]  Amen.
[1034.58 --> 1034.62]  Amen.
[1034.62 --> 1034.66]  Amen.
[1034.66 --> 1034.70]  Amen.
[1034.70 --> 1035.20]  Amen.
[1035.20 --> 1035.62]  Amen.
[1035.62 --> 1035.70]  Amen.
[1035.70 --> 1036.12]  Amen.
[1036.12 --> 1036.20]  Amen.
[1047.64 --> 1048.62]  Amen.
[1048.62 --> 1049.30]  Amen.
[1049.30 --> 1050.26]  Amen.
[1050.26 --> 1050.64]  Amen.
[1050.66 --> 1050.70]  Amen.
[1050.70 --> 1051.34]  Amen.
[1051.34 --> 1051.46]  Amen.
[1051.52 --> 1051.64]  Amen.
[1052.52 --> 1053.20]  Amen.
[1053.20 --> 1053.42]  Amen.
[1053.42 --> 1054.50]  Amen.
[1054.50 --> 1055.42]  Amen.
[1055.42 --> 1060.30]  Amen.
[1061.14 --> 1067.44]  Amen.
[1067.44 --> 1067.88]  Amen.
[1067.88 --> 1069.20]  Amen.
[1069.38 --> 1070.52]  Amen.
[1070.52 --> 1071.00]  Amen.
[1077.36 --> 1084.68]  We stand before you claiming this incredible gift and nothing else to make us beautiful again.
[1085.56 --> 1091.10]  We beseech you to mold us daily into the beauty and likeness of Jesus. Amen.
[1096.10 --> 1098.64]  Could we have the response of reading up, please?
[1098.64 --> 1107.44]  This is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you,
[1108.34 --> 1111.68]  God is light. In him there is no darkness at all.
[1112.46 --> 1119.44]  If we claim to have fellowship with him, yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.
[1119.44 --> 1127.52]  But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,
[1128.06 --> 1134.14]  and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all unrighteousness.
[1135.18 --> 1136.92]  Would you please rise to sing?
[1149.44 --> 1171.62]  O for a thousand tongues to sing, my great Redeemer's praise.
[1171.62 --> 1182.34]  The glories of my God in me, the triumphs of his grace.
[1183.02 --> 1193.00]  Jesus, the name that charms our fears, that bids our sorrows cease.
[1193.00 --> 1203.74]  He is losing in the sinner's ears, to his love and health and peace.
[1204.44 --> 1213.88]  He breaks the power of that soul's sin, he sets the prisoners free.
[1213.88 --> 1224.70]  His blood can make the forest clean, his blood availed for me.
[1226.10 --> 1236.36]  Glory to God and praise and love we ever, ever give.
[1236.36 --> 1246.84]  The saints below and saints above, the church in earth and day.
[1266.36 --> 1291.80]  And all who've gone before us, and all who will believe, will sing the song of ages to the Lamb.
[1291.80 --> 1321.78]  The angels cry.
[1321.80 --> 1351.78]  Holy, holy, holy, holy forever.
[1351.78 --> 1358.46]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[1358.46 --> 1362.36]  And if you walk in freedom
[1362.36 --> 1366.20]  And if you bear His name
[1366.20 --> 1372.40]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[1372.40 --> 1377.36]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
[1377.36 --> 1380.28]  And the angels cry
[1380.28 --> 1387.30]  Holy, the creation cries
[1387.30 --> 1393.64]  Holy, you will lift your heart
[1393.64 --> 1399.48]  Holy, holy forever
[1399.48 --> 1406.42]  We will be the same
[1406.42 --> 1412.84]  Holy to the King of kings
[1412.84 --> 1418.70]  Holy, you will always be
[1418.70 --> 1425.08]  Holy, holy forever
[1425.08 --> 1433.10]  Your name is the highest
[1433.10 --> 1436.26]  Your name is the greatest
[1436.26 --> 1442.50]  Your name stands above them all
[1442.50 --> 1446.36]  All thrones and dominions
[1446.36 --> 1449.14]  All powers and positions
[1449.14 --> 1454.38]  Your name stands above them all
[1454.38 --> 1459.06]  Your name is the highest
[1459.06 --> 1462.32]  Your name is the greatest
[1462.32 --> 1468.38]  Your name stands above them all
[1468.38 --> 1472.28]  All thrones and dominions
[1472.28 --> 1474.80]  All powers and positions
[1474.80 --> 1479.40]  Your name stands above them all
[1479.40 --> 1482.42]  And the angels cry
[1482.42 --> 1483.54]  And the angels cry
[1483.54 --> 1489.86]  Holy, the creation cries
[1489.86 --> 1496.10]  Holy, you will lift me high
[1496.10 --> 1501.42]  Holy, holy forever
[1501.42 --> 1502.42]  Holy, holy forever
[1502.42 --> 1508.44]  Holy, you will always be
[1508.44 --> 1510.42]  Holy, holy forever
[1510.42 --> 1514.42]  Holy, holy forever
[1514.42 --> 1515.42]  You will always be
[1515.42 --> 1523.40]  Holy, holy forever
[1523.40 --> 1523.44]  Holy, holy forever
[1523.44 --> 1528.58]  Holy, holy forever
[1528.58 --> 1532.94]  You will always be
[1532.94 --> 1536.44]  Holy, holy forever
[1536.44 --> 1540.14]  Holy Father
[1540.14 --> 1546.02]  You may be seated.
[1548.50 --> 1554.38]  At this time, we will invite the children to go to their classes in Kids Life.
[1566.44 --> 1588.44]  We are happy to have with us Pastor Dan Kierkegaard, who actually lives in Tawasson, but has been an ordained minister in the United Church for 27 years, the last 14 of those years in Tawasson.
[1588.44 --> 1598.36]  He retired last June, and so we are happy to have him with us today. He said he's still trying to figure out what that looks like.
[1598.96 --> 1603.78]  So I assured him it does take a little bit of time to figure out your retirement and what you're going to do with that.
[1604.26 --> 1609.80]  So with that, welcome Pastor Dan. He said I could just call him Dan, but I just don't feel right doing that.
[1610.56 --> 1613.78]  So Pastor Dan, come on up, and thank you for being here this morning.
[1618.44 --> 1644.34]  Thank you for your welcome here and for my joy in being here to be part of your worship and to give a word that I have trusted into God's hands that might be spoken here this day.
[1644.34 --> 1661.34]  So I'm going to read the passage of scriptures for us, two pieces, but it's probably not going to flow the same way that we typically do in reading the whole of the scripture that's in front of us.
[1661.34 --> 1685.44]  And I'm doing that on purpose because I want us to hear and catch the structure of the scripture that is guiding us, not only clearly the word of scripture and the fullness of that word is vital for us in our growth and learning and in our teaching and sharing with others.
[1685.44 --> 1694.92]  But sometimes we don't look at the structure and see what it tells us about the way that God works in us and through us.
[1695.56 --> 1706.04]  So if it feels a little bit, oh, sorry, a little bit disjointed, you're not wrong in that.
[1706.54 --> 1708.08]  That's the way it's being read.
[1708.08 --> 1718.70]  And so if we might hear in the scriptures, we're going to read from Genesis in the first chapter and various verses through that.
[1719.00 --> 1725.18]  And then I have a short piece in Ephesians that I would read.
[1727.38 --> 1729.44]  I need to use this, don't I?
[1729.56 --> 1730.20]  Thank you.
[1730.20 --> 1730.26]  Thank you.
[1730.26 --> 1739.82]  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[1740.88 --> 1744.46]  Now the earth was formless and empty.
[1745.56 --> 1749.10]  Darkness was over the surface of the deep.
[1749.86 --> 1754.04]  And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[1754.04 --> 1761.54]  So God created mankind in his own image.
[1762.76 --> 1766.28]  In the image of God, he created them male and female.
[1766.82 --> 1768.00]  He created them.
[1769.54 --> 1772.84]  God saw all that he had made.
[1773.64 --> 1775.72]  And it was very good.
[1777.14 --> 1778.64]  And there was evening.
[1779.22 --> 1780.18]  And there was morning.
[1781.00 --> 1782.28]  The sixth day.
[1784.04 --> 1792.04]  Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all of their vast array.
[1793.08 --> 1797.20]  By the seventh day, God had finished the work he had been doing.
[1798.02 --> 1802.60]  So on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.
[1802.60 --> 1809.06]  I want us to hear that.
[1810.14 --> 1815.16]  And in that passage, it didn't come quite through in the writing of this.
[1815.64 --> 1821.98]  But it says also, God looked upon that which he had done.
[1823.48 --> 1825.04]  And it was good.
[1825.04 --> 1835.90]  Now, if you read through the whole of that first passage, you will see that come up over and over again, repeatedly.
[1836.36 --> 1840.80]  Each day, God created and it was good.
[1842.40 --> 1845.60]  God created and it was good.
[1845.60 --> 1871.14]  And then we turn in the New Testament.
[1871.14 --> 1880.16]  And this is by no means comprehensive because we just don't have the time for all of the Bible today.
[1880.86 --> 1884.14]  But the same message is there in Ephesians.
[1884.94 --> 1888.44]  Ephesians is one of my favorite books when I was a teenager.
[1888.70 --> 1892.90]  It's the book that caught my attention and I read it over and over.
[1892.90 --> 1895.72]  And I still go back to it.
[1897.22 --> 1899.78]  In Ephesians 2 and verse 10.
[1902.02 --> 1904.10]  For we are God's handiwork.
[1905.24 --> 1908.60]  Created in Christ Jesus to do good works.
[1909.12 --> 1915.32]  Which God prepared in advance for us to do.
[1917.70 --> 1919.98]  God knew what he was doing.
[1920.68 --> 1922.52]  God planned what would be.
[1922.90 --> 1928.10]  And God called us into being to take part within it.
[1929.34 --> 1937.02]  And we could say, it's not in so many words, but we could say, and it was good.
[1938.00 --> 1946.70]  God's handiwork called us to do the good work that God had prepared for us.
[1946.70 --> 1948.34]  Not what we think.
[1948.96 --> 1951.76]  Not what we plan and make our hearts.
[1952.18 --> 1953.50]  This is what it's got to be.
[1953.84 --> 1956.46]  God's got to thank me for doing this good work.
[1957.74 --> 1958.12]  No.
[1958.90 --> 1963.24]  God prepared it in advance for us to do.
[1963.24 --> 1969.26]  We are simply being faithful and true to the calling of God.
[1969.26 --> 1969.72]  God.
[1972.50 --> 1978.60]  So in hearing these passages of scripture, I would like to bring some thoughts today.
[1978.60 --> 1981.30]  thank you for your invitation
[1981.30 --> 1982.86]  yes I've been retired for
[1982.86 --> 1984.70]  six and a half months
[1984.70 --> 1987.74]  and it's my first time in the pulpit
[1987.74 --> 1988.44]  since then
[1988.44 --> 1990.74]  so if I stumble a little bit
[1990.74 --> 1992.40]  I'm a little bit out of practice
[1992.40 --> 1995.14]  but I entrust what I have to bring
[1995.14 --> 1996.14]  to God
[1996.14 --> 1999.38]  and to you as an offering
[1999.38 --> 2012.34]  let me tell you a story
[2012.34 --> 2015.78]  about a man named Jesus
[2015.78 --> 2019.70]  he walked on the earth
[2019.70 --> 2022.50]  two thousand years ago
[2022.50 --> 2027.50]  he spoke the word of love and peace
[2027.50 --> 2030.84]  for by him they were made
[2030.84 --> 2036.70]  and he calls us all to follow him
[2036.70 --> 2041.98]  yes he spoke the words of love and peace
[2041.98 --> 2045.52]  for by him they were made
[2045.52 --> 2051.60]  and he called us all to follow him
[2051.60 --> 2057.52]  I was 20 years old
[2057.52 --> 2060.54]  traveling with the Covenant Players
[2060.54 --> 2063.28]  an itinerant Christian theater company
[2063.28 --> 2065.54]  based out of Los Angeles California
[2065.54 --> 2068.60]  and that meant that we would travel
[2068.60 --> 2070.58]  for 10 months of the year
[2070.58 --> 2075.84]  around one or more states
[2075.84 --> 2078.76]  or any of the other countries
[2078.76 --> 2080.22]  where we would travel
[2080.22 --> 2083.80]  and we would present the gospel message
[2083.80 --> 2085.58]  through music and theater
[2085.58 --> 2089.04]  in churches, schools, military bases
[2089.04 --> 2090.18]  hospitals
[2090.18 --> 2092.96]  wherever people would welcome us
[2092.96 --> 2095.04]  well one day
[2095.04 --> 2097.84]  we were out doing the PR
[2098.50 --> 2100.62]  the public relations work
[2100.62 --> 2102.74]  to set up the itinerary
[2102.74 --> 2104.40]  for the next time
[2104.40 --> 2105.58]  through that area
[2105.58 --> 2109.02]  it was a hot sunny day
[2109.02 --> 2110.90]  and I was a bit weary
[2110.90 --> 2113.04]  and perhaps a bit discouraged
[2113.04 --> 2115.32]  I wasn't one that really liked
[2115.32 --> 2116.88]  the public relations side
[2116.88 --> 2118.88]  of our work that we were doing
[2118.88 --> 2119.50]  in ministry
[2119.50 --> 2121.94]  but it was necessary
[2121.94 --> 2125.44]  I sat down on that roadside curb
[2125.44 --> 2128.08]  and wrote these words
[2128.08 --> 2131.08]  to that tune running through my head
[2131.08 --> 2135.04]  I've always been too shy
[2135.04 --> 2136.24]  and even embarrassed
[2136.24 --> 2137.84]  to sing the song
[2137.84 --> 2140.76]  because in my mind
[2140.76 --> 2143.00]  in my way of thinking
[2143.00 --> 2146.00]  in the way that I would have done things
[2146.00 --> 2149.10]  it wasn't good enough
[2149.10 --> 2152.10]  musically it wasn't good enough
[2152.10 --> 2153.84]  and it was too simplistic
[2153.84 --> 2155.68]  to have any impact
[2155.68 --> 2159.46]  I was clearly happy
[2159.46 --> 2160.30]  in the moment
[2160.30 --> 2161.78]  to sit and write
[2161.78 --> 2164.70]  those simple song words
[2164.70 --> 2167.32]  and experience the work
[2167.32 --> 2168.70]  of God's Holy Spirit
[2168.70 --> 2170.52]  moving in me at that time
[2170.52 --> 2173.68]  I know that moment
[2173.68 --> 2175.38]  even today
[2175.38 --> 2177.42]  some 40 years later
[2177.42 --> 2181.74]  but I was torn between
[2181.74 --> 2184.84]  this sense of God
[2184.84 --> 2186.96]  working in me
[2186.96 --> 2190.88]  and between my doubts
[2190.88 --> 2193.24]  that it would be received
[2193.24 --> 2194.52]  by anybody else
[2194.52 --> 2199.78]  but it did have an impact on me
[2199.78 --> 2202.52]  I've never doubted
[2202.52 --> 2204.16]  the clear and direct truth
[2204.16 --> 2205.12]  of the message
[2205.12 --> 2206.54]  of the simple song
[2206.54 --> 2209.06]  I even remember the words
[2209.06 --> 2210.54]  from memory
[2210.54 --> 2211.82]  40 years later
[2211.82 --> 2213.92]  and it was only
[2213.92 --> 2215.96]  in me packing up my stuff
[2215.96 --> 2217.24]  from my office
[2217.24 --> 2218.06]  in retirement
[2218.06 --> 2219.48]  six months ago
[2219.48 --> 2221.18]  that I finally came across
[2221.18 --> 2222.76]  that page
[2222.76 --> 2224.82]  that I had sat and printed
[2224.82 --> 2226.98]  those many years ago
[2226.98 --> 2231.60]  I still have
[2231.60 --> 2233.46]  that paper now
[2233.46 --> 2235.72]  and I'm not so
[2235.72 --> 2237.54]  ashamed of
[2237.54 --> 2238.62]  singing it
[2238.62 --> 2242.04]  but why do I tell you
[2242.04 --> 2242.64]  this
[2242.64 --> 2244.16]  passing memory
[2244.16 --> 2245.26]  of my young life
[2245.26 --> 2246.64]  and the way that my faith
[2246.64 --> 2247.84]  was seeking
[2247.84 --> 2248.92]  expression
[2248.92 --> 2251.12]  I tell you
[2251.12 --> 2252.42]  because
[2252.42 --> 2254.02]  we hear
[2254.02 --> 2255.44]  the story
[2255.44 --> 2257.30]  the revelation
[2257.30 --> 2258.30]  of God's work
[2258.30 --> 2259.56]  through the living
[2259.56 --> 2260.76]  eternal word
[2260.76 --> 2262.44]  the gospel message
[2262.44 --> 2263.78]  again today
[2263.78 --> 2267.74]  as a gathered body
[2267.74 --> 2268.88]  of Christ
[2268.88 --> 2271.08]  in this local congregation
[2271.08 --> 2272.70]  and I'm glad
[2272.70 --> 2273.40]  to be a part
[2273.40 --> 2274.34]  with you
[2274.34 --> 2277.32]  how many times
[2277.32 --> 2278.30]  have we heard
[2278.30 --> 2280.38]  this revelation
[2280.38 --> 2282.08]  this word of God
[2282.08 --> 2283.76]  how many times
[2283.76 --> 2284.58]  have we heard it
[2284.58 --> 2285.56]  and done nothing
[2285.56 --> 2287.42]  to tell others
[2287.42 --> 2289.46]  perhaps because
[2289.46 --> 2290.62]  we think
[2290.62 --> 2292.26]  we won't do
[2292.26 --> 2292.96]  a good enough
[2292.96 --> 2293.50]  job
[2293.50 --> 2297.16]  we won't do
[2297.16 --> 2297.68]  a good enough
[2297.68 --> 2298.60]  job in telling
[2298.60 --> 2299.82]  the simple truth
[2299.82 --> 2301.62]  and it might
[2301.62 --> 2302.44]  come across
[2302.44 --> 2303.02]  as if
[2303.02 --> 2304.26]  do we really
[2304.26 --> 2305.80]  believe it
[2305.80 --> 2307.76]  if we can't
[2307.76 --> 2308.60]  tell it
[2308.60 --> 2309.32]  with confidence
[2309.32 --> 2312.38]  or
[2312.38 --> 2314.26]  there is another
[2314.26 --> 2316.14]  hesitation
[2316.14 --> 2316.64]  or
[2316.64 --> 2318.02]  another way
[2318.02 --> 2318.64]  of seeing
[2318.64 --> 2319.70]  how we
[2319.70 --> 2320.46]  share the word
[2320.46 --> 2320.98]  of God
[2320.98 --> 2322.24]  we could
[2322.24 --> 2323.46]  intentionally
[2323.46 --> 2324.48]  make ourselves
[2324.48 --> 2325.78]  vulnerable
[2325.78 --> 2326.98]  in telling
[2326.98 --> 2327.82]  that simple
[2327.82 --> 2329.08]  direct truth
[2329.08 --> 2330.10]  so that
[2330.10 --> 2330.80]  someone who
[2330.80 --> 2331.80]  needs to hear
[2331.80 --> 2332.44]  it
[2332.44 --> 2333.16]  may
[2333.16 --> 2334.04]  may
[2334.04 --> 2334.72]  may
[2334.72 --> 2335.56]  hear it
[2335.56 --> 2337.24]  they may not
[2337.24 --> 2338.96]  but they may
[2338.96 --> 2339.68]  hear it
[2339.68 --> 2341.16]  because
[2341.16 --> 2343.10]  we stood up
[2343.10 --> 2344.40]  and spoke it
[2344.40 --> 2346.48]  it's a good
[2346.48 --> 2347.40]  question for us
[2347.40 --> 2348.44]  to contemplate
[2348.44 --> 2349.10]  in these
[2349.10 --> 2350.40]  tumultuous days
[2350.40 --> 2352.02]  to examine
[2352.02 --> 2352.76]  our heart
[2352.76 --> 2353.36]  and our
[2353.36 --> 2353.78]  openness
[2353.78 --> 2354.96]  to the work
[2354.96 --> 2355.58]  of the Spirit
[2355.58 --> 2356.16]  of God
[2356.16 --> 2356.82]  in us
[2356.82 --> 2358.00]  as we hear
[2358.00 --> 2359.70]  the story
[2359.70 --> 2362.60]  either
[2362.60 --> 2364.02]  again
[2364.02 --> 2366.24]  or perhaps
[2366.24 --> 2366.92]  for the first
[2366.92 --> 2367.30]  time
[2367.30 --> 2371.94]  will you
[2371.94 --> 2372.50]  and I
[2372.50 --> 2373.50]  another
[2373.50 --> 2374.14]  question
[2374.14 --> 2375.08]  to
[2375.08 --> 2376.76]  contemplate
[2376.76 --> 2378.04]  after the
[2378.04 --> 2378.96]  service today
[2378.96 --> 2379.44]  and into
[2379.44 --> 2379.86]  the week
[2379.86 --> 2380.24]  ahead
[2380.24 --> 2382.08]  will we
[2382.08 --> 2382.88]  will you
[2382.88 --> 2383.42]  and I
[2383.42 --> 2384.52]  be the
[2384.52 --> 2384.98]  person
[2384.98 --> 2385.46]  that we
[2385.46 --> 2386.14]  sing about
[2386.14 --> 2386.58]  in the
[2386.58 --> 2387.04]  old
[2387.04 --> 2387.66]  and blessed
[2387.66 --> 2388.16]  hymn
[2388.16 --> 2389.84]  I love
[2389.84 --> 2390.38]  to tell
[2390.38 --> 2391.16]  the story
[2391.16 --> 2393.72]  of unseen
[2393.72 --> 2394.30]  things
[2394.30 --> 2394.76]  above
[2394.76 --> 2395.98]  of Jesus
[2395.98 --> 2396.54]  and his
[2396.54 --> 2397.04]  glory
[2397.04 --> 2398.10]  of Jesus
[2398.10 --> 2398.90]  and his
[2398.90 --> 2399.30]  love
[2399.30 --> 2400.62]  I love
[2400.62 --> 2401.06]  to tell
[2401.06 --> 2401.64]  this story
[2401.64 --> 2402.02]  because
[2402.02 --> 2403.32]  I know
[2403.32 --> 2404.16]  it's true
[2404.16 --> 2406.00]  it satisfies
[2406.00 --> 2407.30]  my longings
[2407.30 --> 2408.30]  as nothing
[2408.30 --> 2408.86]  else
[2408.86 --> 2409.48]  can do
[2409.48 --> 2411.00]  I love
[2411.00 --> 2411.50]  to tell
[2411.50 --> 2412.20]  the story
[2412.20 --> 2413.42]  it will be
[2413.42 --> 2414.40]  my theme
[2414.40 --> 2415.10]  in glory
[2415.10 --> 2416.10]  to tell
[2416.10 --> 2417.20]  the old
[2417.20 --> 2418.24]  old story
[2418.24 --> 2419.56]  of Jesus
[2419.56 --> 2420.90]  and his
[2420.90 --> 2421.34]  love
[2421.34 --> 2424.44]  so a couple
[2424.44 --> 2425.14]  of questions
[2425.14 --> 2425.68]  for us
[2425.68 --> 2426.66]  to contemplate
[2426.66 --> 2427.90]  in hearing
[2427.90 --> 2428.56]  the word
[2428.56 --> 2430.00]  in putting
[2430.00 --> 2430.54]  it into
[2430.54 --> 2431.84]  forms
[2431.84 --> 2432.46]  that we
[2432.46 --> 2433.32]  might express
[2433.32 --> 2433.66]  it
[2433.66 --> 2434.54]  whether that's
[2434.54 --> 2435.24]  in song
[2435.24 --> 2436.56]  in words
[2436.56 --> 2437.86]  whether that's
[2437.86 --> 2438.16]  in our
[2438.16 --> 2438.88]  actions
[2438.88 --> 2440.18]  the things
[2440.18 --> 2440.62]  that we
[2440.62 --> 2441.08]  do
[2441.08 --> 2442.38]  as gifted
[2442.38 --> 2443.02]  to us
[2443.02 --> 2443.84]  by God
[2443.84 --> 2444.68]  that we
[2444.68 --> 2445.74]  might share
[2445.74 --> 2446.50]  it with
[2446.50 --> 2446.98]  others
[2446.98 --> 2448.86]  I would
[2448.86 --> 2449.26]  like to
[2449.26 --> 2450.08]  explore a few
[2450.08 --> 2450.60]  points
[2450.60 --> 2452.04]  around this
[2452.04 --> 2453.00]  gospel message
[2453.00 --> 2453.38]  and our
[2453.38 --> 2453.92]  response
[2453.92 --> 2454.16]  to
[2454.16 --> 2455.00]  storytelling
[2455.00 --> 2456.72]  that is
[2456.72 --> 2457.28]  important
[2457.28 --> 2457.92]  for us
[2457.92 --> 2458.54]  to hear
[2458.54 --> 2459.26]  and deeply
[2459.26 --> 2460.24]  consider
[2460.24 --> 2463.18]  it is not
[2463.18 --> 2463.90]  a guilt trip
[2463.90 --> 2464.98]  that I'm asking
[2464.98 --> 2465.98]  you to think on
[2465.98 --> 2467.50]  but it may well
[2467.50 --> 2468.44]  be a faithful
[2468.44 --> 2469.12]  examination
[2469.12 --> 2470.30]  of the state
[2470.30 --> 2471.78]  of our faith
[2471.78 --> 2472.62]  each
[2472.62 --> 2473.86]  and every day
[2473.86 --> 2475.66]  are we
[2475.66 --> 2476.50]  listening
[2476.50 --> 2478.90]  to a story
[2478.90 --> 2481.36]  or are we
[2481.36 --> 2481.76]  listening
[2481.76 --> 2483.06]  to the
[2483.06 --> 2484.10]  story
[2484.10 --> 2487.10]  are we
[2487.10 --> 2487.58]  telling
[2487.58 --> 2489.66]  a story
[2489.66 --> 2492.20]  or are we
[2492.20 --> 2493.02]  telling
[2493.02 --> 2494.70]  the story
[2494.70 --> 2497.08]  it matters
[2497.08 --> 2499.24]  they're simple
[2499.24 --> 2500.10]  tiny little
[2500.10 --> 2500.74]  words
[2500.74 --> 2501.98]  but they make
[2501.98 --> 2502.62]  all the
[2502.62 --> 2503.14]  difference
[2503.14 --> 2504.20]  in our
[2504.20 --> 2504.62]  life
[2504.62 --> 2505.62]  and in the
[2505.62 --> 2505.96]  life
[2505.96 --> 2506.94]  of those
[2506.94 --> 2507.68]  who believe
[2507.68 --> 2510.08]  a story
[2510.08 --> 2511.52]  that's
[2511.52 --> 2512.34]  the beginning
[2512.34 --> 2512.90]  letter of the
[2512.90 --> 2513.30]  alphabet
[2513.30 --> 2514.10]  a
[2514.10 --> 2515.78]  a story
[2515.78 --> 2517.46]  can be
[2517.46 --> 2518.18]  made up
[2518.18 --> 2519.16]  as a
[2519.16 --> 2519.78]  fabricated
[2519.78 --> 2520.10]  tale
[2520.10 --> 2523.78]  God knows
[2523.78 --> 2524.32]  we're hearing
[2524.32 --> 2525.88]  many fabricated
[2525.88 --> 2526.62]  tales in the
[2526.62 --> 2526.96]  world
[2526.96 --> 2527.74]  these days
[2527.74 --> 2532.60]  the story
[2532.60 --> 2533.96]  T-H-E
[2533.96 --> 2535.66]  is a
[2535.66 --> 2536.22]  witnessed
[2536.22 --> 2537.80]  and experienced
[2537.80 --> 2538.82]  real life
[2538.82 --> 2539.96]  transformational
[2539.96 --> 2540.50]  event
[2540.50 --> 2541.88]  scripture
[2541.88 --> 2542.72]  is not
[2542.72 --> 2543.96]  a story
[2543.96 --> 2545.86]  it is
[2545.86 --> 2546.88]  the story
[2546.88 --> 2548.28]  passed down
[2548.28 --> 2549.14]  and lived
[2549.14 --> 2549.64]  deeply
[2549.64 --> 2550.60]  from generation
[2550.60 --> 2552.16]  to generation
[2552.16 --> 2554.02]  that's why
[2554.02 --> 2554.46]  we read
[2554.46 --> 2555.10]  the scriptures
[2555.10 --> 2556.10]  over
[2556.10 --> 2557.20]  and over
[2557.20 --> 2558.10]  and it
[2558.10 --> 2559.10]  reminds us
[2559.10 --> 2560.14]  not only
[2560.14 --> 2560.58]  of our
[2560.58 --> 2561.36]  present day
[2561.36 --> 2561.94]  and this
[2561.94 --> 2562.36]  moment
[2562.36 --> 2562.90]  in our
[2562.90 --> 2563.36]  life
[2563.36 --> 2564.04]  but
[2564.04 --> 2565.94]  the moment
[2565.94 --> 2566.50]  that God
[2566.50 --> 2567.06]  created
[2567.06 --> 2569.24]  and it
[2569.24 --> 2570.04]  was good
[2570.04 --> 2572.52]  and he
[2572.52 --> 2573.36]  made us
[2573.36 --> 2574.44]  in his
[2574.44 --> 2574.92]  image
[2574.92 --> 2576.58]  to share
[2576.58 --> 2577.02]  that
[2577.02 --> 2578.56]  as freely
[2578.56 --> 2579.06]  and as
[2579.06 --> 2579.42]  fully
[2579.42 --> 2579.88]  as we
[2579.88 --> 2580.32]  are able
[2580.32 --> 2582.74]  the awe
[2582.74 --> 2583.08]  and the
[2583.08 --> 2583.52]  wonder of
[2583.52 --> 2583.96]  creation
[2583.96 --> 2584.62]  story
[2584.62 --> 2585.82]  spoken and
[2585.82 --> 2586.32]  revealed
[2586.32 --> 2586.74]  in the
[2586.74 --> 2587.18]  beginning
[2587.18 --> 2587.60]  God
[2587.60 --> 2588.12]  created
[2588.12 --> 2589.00]  repeatedly
[2589.00 --> 2589.60]  God
[2589.60 --> 2590.06]  said
[2590.06 --> 2591.00]  and it
[2591.00 --> 2591.42]  was
[2591.42 --> 2591.96]  good
[2591.96 --> 2593.48]  each
[2593.48 --> 2593.94]  day
[2593.94 --> 2594.46]  of
[2594.46 --> 2594.86]  six
[2594.86 --> 2595.42]  days
[2595.42 --> 2596.56]  shows
[2596.56 --> 2596.84]  all
[2596.84 --> 2597.06]  this
[2597.06 --> 2597.56]  imagery
[2597.56 --> 2597.98]  you can
[2597.98 --> 2598.42]  bring the
[2598.42 --> 2598.72]  imagery
[2598.72 --> 2599.12]  even though
[2599.12 --> 2599.40]  we're not
[2599.40 --> 2599.92]  reading it
[2599.92 --> 2600.26]  if you've
[2600.26 --> 2600.72]  read it so
[2600.72 --> 2601.38]  many times
[2601.38 --> 2601.84]  before
[2601.84 --> 2602.68]  on the
[2602.68 --> 2603.44]  first day
[2603.44 --> 2605.20]  and it
[2605.20 --> 2605.84]  was good
[2605.84 --> 2607.52]  and on the
[2607.52 --> 2608.16]  second day
[2608.16 --> 2608.78]  and it
[2608.78 --> 2609.52]  was good
[2609.52 --> 2610.32]  and you can
[2610.32 --> 2611.16]  imagine each
[2611.16 --> 2612.00]  day that
[2612.00 --> 2612.74]  it was good
[2612.74 --> 2614.12]  getting more
[2614.12 --> 2614.70]  and more
[2614.70 --> 2615.84]  solid
[2615.84 --> 2616.48]  and more
[2616.48 --> 2616.90]  and more
[2616.90 --> 2618.50]  volume to it
[2618.50 --> 2619.24]  because it
[2619.24 --> 2620.70]  was creating
[2620.70 --> 2621.28]  something
[2621.28 --> 2622.00]  amazing
[2622.00 --> 2623.18]  something
[2623.18 --> 2623.92]  beautiful
[2623.92 --> 2625.58]  and God
[2625.58 --> 2626.50]  was so
[2626.50 --> 2627.60]  thankful
[2627.60 --> 2628.08]  that he
[2628.08 --> 2628.70]  chose
[2628.70 --> 2629.50]  to do
[2629.50 --> 2629.92]  that
[2629.92 --> 2630.82]  and to
[2630.82 --> 2631.24]  include
[2631.24 --> 2631.70]  us in
[2631.70 --> 2631.94]  it
[2631.94 --> 2635.56]  do we
[2635.56 --> 2636.12]  hear the
[2636.12 --> 2636.58]  building
[2636.58 --> 2637.98]  of this
[2637.98 --> 2638.44]  word of
[2638.44 --> 2638.86]  God
[2638.86 --> 2640.76]  that calls
[2640.76 --> 2641.34]  us to
[2641.34 --> 2641.84]  create
[2641.84 --> 2642.48]  and to
[2642.48 --> 2642.78]  make
[2642.78 --> 2643.32]  something
[2643.32 --> 2643.90]  beautiful
[2643.90 --> 2646.40]  in God's
[2646.40 --> 2646.78]  image
[2646.78 --> 2646.82]  image
[2646.82 --> 2648.88]  not in
[2648.88 --> 2649.10]  our
[2649.10 --> 2649.50]  image
[2649.50 --> 2652.84]  I
[2652.84 --> 2653.32]  purposely
[2653.32 --> 2654.54]  did not
[2654.54 --> 2655.00]  have us
[2655.00 --> 2655.54]  read through
[2655.54 --> 2655.94]  as I
[2655.94 --> 2656.34]  said
[2656.34 --> 2657.36]  these days
[2657.36 --> 2658.98]  of repetition
[2658.98 --> 2659.86]  but I
[2659.86 --> 2660.18]  could
[2660.18 --> 2660.98]  but it
[2660.98 --> 2661.42]  could be
[2661.42 --> 2662.18]  beautifully
[2662.18 --> 2662.84]  affirming
[2662.84 --> 2663.52]  practice
[2663.52 --> 2663.92]  throughout
[2663.92 --> 2664.40]  the week
[2664.40 --> 2664.70]  for you
[2664.70 --> 2665.08]  to do
[2665.08 --> 2665.48]  that
[2665.48 --> 2666.90]  maybe
[2666.90 --> 2667.54]  once a
[2667.54 --> 2668.44]  day
[2668.44 --> 2668.74]  just
[2668.74 --> 2669.70]  the first
[2669.70 --> 2670.04]  day
[2670.04 --> 2672.24]  and just
[2672.24 --> 2672.66]  hear it
[2672.66 --> 2673.00]  again
[2673.00 --> 2673.46]  and it
[2673.46 --> 2673.98]  was good
[2673.98 --> 2675.24]  the second
[2675.24 --> 2675.50]  day
[2675.50 --> 2675.72]  two
[2675.72 --> 2676.34]  verses
[2676.34 --> 2677.00]  the first
[2677.00 --> 2677.26]  day
[2677.26 --> 2677.60]  and the
[2677.60 --> 2677.88]  second
[2677.88 --> 2678.24]  day
[2678.24 --> 2679.48]  just a
[2679.48 --> 2680.08]  practice
[2680.08 --> 2681.26]  of hearing
[2681.26 --> 2681.74]  the word
[2681.74 --> 2682.26]  of God
[2682.26 --> 2682.90]  and the
[2682.90 --> 2683.84]  affirmation
[2683.84 --> 2685.12]  of God's
[2685.12 --> 2687.06]  gift
[2687.06 --> 2688.00]  to us
[2688.00 --> 2691.60]  in
[2691.60 --> 2692.10]  Ephesians
[2692.10 --> 2692.46]  2
[2692.46 --> 2694.06]  Paul's
[2694.06 --> 2694.48]  letter to
[2694.48 --> 2694.86]  the early
[2694.86 --> 2695.26]  church
[2695.26 --> 2695.76]  speaks
[2695.76 --> 2697.16]  and affirms
[2697.16 --> 2698.16]  this same
[2698.16 --> 2698.70]  message
[2698.70 --> 2699.74]  packaged in
[2699.74 --> 2700.66]  perhaps a
[2700.66 --> 2701.24]  few different
[2701.24 --> 2702.20]  words or
[2702.20 --> 2702.60]  phrases
[2702.60 --> 2703.88]  but with
[2703.88 --> 2704.32]  the same
[2704.32 --> 2705.24]  affirmation
[2705.24 --> 2706.50]  of God's
[2706.50 --> 2707.40]  workmanship
[2707.40 --> 2708.64]  spoken
[2708.64 --> 2710.44]  into being
[2710.44 --> 2711.96]  and formed
[2711.96 --> 2712.64]  in the
[2712.64 --> 2713.24]  beauty of
[2713.24 --> 2713.76]  God's
[2713.76 --> 2714.26]  image
[2714.26 --> 2716.36]  and it
[2716.36 --> 2717.10]  was good
[2717.10 --> 2718.52]  that's God
[2718.52 --> 2719.10]  talking about
[2719.10 --> 2719.72]  you and I
[2719.72 --> 2721.28]  each one
[2721.28 --> 2721.78]  of us
[2721.78 --> 2723.48]  do you ever
[2723.48 --> 2724.08]  hear God
[2724.08 --> 2724.92]  talking about
[2724.92 --> 2725.62]  yourself
[2725.62 --> 2726.50]  in that way
[2726.50 --> 2727.50]  when you read
[2727.50 --> 2728.06]  the scriptures
[2728.06 --> 2728.92]  do you put
[2728.92 --> 2729.60]  yourself right
[2729.60 --> 2730.12]  in the middle
[2730.12 --> 2730.50]  of that
[2730.50 --> 2731.72]  God said
[2731.72 --> 2732.00]  it was
[2732.00 --> 2732.40]  good
[2732.40 --> 2737.20]  the segment
[2737.20 --> 2737.90]  of the stories
[2737.90 --> 2738.34]  that we hear
[2738.34 --> 2738.94]  this morning
[2738.94 --> 2740.28]  from significant
[2740.28 --> 2741.10]  portions of
[2741.10 --> 2741.70]  the scripture
[2741.70 --> 2743.34]  involves the
[2743.34 --> 2744.00]  intentional
[2744.00 --> 2744.88]  active
[2744.88 --> 2746.08]  creative power
[2746.08 --> 2746.72]  of God
[2746.72 --> 2747.90]  and the lived
[2747.90 --> 2748.64]  experience
[2748.64 --> 2749.58]  of many
[2749.58 --> 2751.36]  in scripture
[2751.36 --> 2752.70]  many
[2752.70 --> 2753.84]  throughout history
[2753.84 --> 2754.76]  and many
[2754.76 --> 2755.62]  in this
[2755.62 --> 2756.82]  present day
[2756.82 --> 2758.74]  and in this
[2758.74 --> 2759.12]  church
[2759.12 --> 2759.82]  here today
[2759.82 --> 2764.70]  I spoke
[2764.70 --> 2765.26]  of this
[2765.26 --> 2769.32]  I spoke
[2769.32 --> 2769.70]  of this
[2769.70 --> 2770.04]  sermon
[2770.04 --> 2772.52]  in the
[2772.52 --> 2773.26]  season of
[2773.26 --> 2773.60]  Advent
[2773.60 --> 2774.24]  a portion
[2774.24 --> 2774.72]  of this
[2774.72 --> 2775.02]  sermon
[2775.02 --> 2775.72]  in the
[2775.72 --> 2776.20]  season of
[2776.20 --> 2776.54]  Advent
[2776.54 --> 2777.72]  and the
[2777.72 --> 2778.14]  reading
[2778.14 --> 2779.06]  was about
[2779.06 --> 2780.46]  two women
[2780.46 --> 2782.30]  blessed
[2782.30 --> 2783.62]  as chosen
[2783.62 --> 2784.42]  by God
[2784.42 --> 2785.50]  to give
[2785.50 --> 2786.26]  substance
[2786.26 --> 2787.40]  to the
[2787.40 --> 2788.14]  strange
[2788.14 --> 2789.06]  blessing
[2789.06 --> 2789.70]  of
[2789.70 --> 2790.10]  bearing
[2790.10 --> 2792.02]  something
[2792.02 --> 2792.64]  beautiful
[2792.64 --> 2794.46]  that's an
[2794.46 --> 2794.88]  interesting
[2794.88 --> 2795.32]  term
[2795.32 --> 2795.76]  isn't it
[2795.76 --> 2796.10]  for us
[2796.10 --> 2796.32]  though
[2796.32 --> 2796.90]  the
[2796.90 --> 2797.42]  strange
[2797.42 --> 2797.92]  blessing
[2797.92 --> 2798.20]  of
[2798.20 --> 2798.56]  bearing
[2798.56 --> 2799.72]  this is
[2799.72 --> 2800.82]  expressed
[2800.82 --> 2801.40]  in a
[2801.40 --> 2801.66]  song
[2801.66 --> 2802.24]  by Steve
[2802.24 --> 2802.60]  Bell
[2802.60 --> 2803.40]  with the
[2803.40 --> 2803.74]  same
[2803.74 --> 2804.18]  title

[2821.18 --> 2821.78]  would bear
[2821.78 --> 2822.42]  was the
[2822.42 --> 2822.94]  fulfillment
[2822.94 --> 2823.74]  of God's
[2823.74 --> 2824.32]  promise

[2829.14 --> 2829.76]  a virgin

[2830.98 --> 2831.20]  even
[2831.20 --> 2831.76]  possible
[2831.76 --> 2836.14]  it was
[2836.14 --> 2836.54]  the word
[2836.54 --> 2837.18]  of God
[2837.18 --> 2838.18]  spoken

[2848.66 --> 2849.28]  messenger
[2849.28 --> 2852.34]  didn't

[2853.16 --> 2853.84]  from God
[2853.84 --> 2855.14]  and he
[2855.14 --> 2856.12]  was silenced

[2862.96 --> 2863.28]  virgin
[2863.28 --> 2864.42]  so
[2864.42 --> 2865.18]  she
[2865.18 --> 2865.78]  questioned
[2865.78 --> 2866.76]  how it
[2866.76 --> 2867.08]  could be
[2867.08 --> 2867.70]  possible

[2869.96 --> 2870.60]  message
[2870.60 --> 2871.26]  confirmed
[2871.26 --> 2872.08]  it was
[2872.08 --> 2872.84]  the spoken
[2872.84 --> 2873.26]  word
[2873.26 --> 2873.90]  of God
[2873.90 --> 2874.68]  into
[2874.68 --> 2876.00]  her being
[2876.00 --> 2878.08]  and

[3307.02 --> 3307.40]  body
[3307.40 --> 3308.60]  a
[3308.60 --> 3309.08]  community
[3309.08 --> 3311.64]  but
[3311.64 --> 3311.90]  how
[3311.90 --> 3312.10]  do
[3312.10 --> 3312.26]  we
[3312.26 --> 3312.66]  see
[3312.66 --> 3314.18]  personal
[3314.18 --> 3314.76]  things
[3314.76 --> 3315.92]  that
[3315.92 --> 3316.10]  we
[3316.10 --> 3316.50]  do
[3316.50 --> 3317.66]  that
[3317.66 --> 3318.00]  open
[3318.00 --> 3318.24]  our
[3318.24 --> 3318.64]  eyes
[3318.64 --> 3318.86]  to
[3318.86 --> 3319.06]  the
[3319.06 --> 3319.40]  movement
[3319.40 --> 3319.66]  of
[3319.66 --> 3319.80]  the
[3319.80 --> 3320.04]  Holy
[3320.04 --> 3320.48]  Spirit
[3320.48 --> 3320.82]  in
[3320.82 --> 3321.18]  us
[3321.18 --> 3322.34]  it's
[3322.34 --> 3323.08]  easier
[3323.08 --> 3323.36]  to
[3323.36 --> 3323.54]  do
[3323.54 --> 3323.68]  it
[3323.68 --> 3323.78]  in
[3323.78 --> 3323.92]  a
[3323.92 --> 3324.22]  group
[3324.22 --> 3325.46]  because
[3325.46 --> 3325.62]  then
[3325.62 --> 3325.72]  we're
[3325.72 --> 3325.92]  not
[3325.92 --> 3326.20]  quite
[3326.20 --> 3326.46]  so
[3326.46 --> 3326.86]  vulnerable
[3326.86 --> 3327.64]  then
[3327.64 --> 3327.74]  we're
[3327.74 --> 3327.90]  not
[3327.90 --> 3328.12]  trying
[3328.12 --> 3328.28]  to
[3328.28 --> 3328.50]  figure
[3328.50 --> 3328.68]  it
[3328.68 --> 3328.84]  out
[3328.84 --> 3329.02]  on
[3329.02 --> 3329.20]  our
[3329.20 --> 3329.54]  own
[3329.54 --> 3329.72]  and
[3329.72 --> 3329.86]  then
[3329.86 --> 3329.98]  we're
[3329.98 --> 3330.14]  not
[3330.14 --> 3330.38]  trying
[3330.38 --> 3330.62]  to
[3330.62 --> 3331.16]  say
[3331.16 --> 3331.46]  oh
[3331.46 --> 3331.86]  that
[3331.86 --> 3332.12]  didn't
[3332.12 --> 3332.40]  work
[3332.40 --> 3332.62]  well
[3332.62 --> 3332.74]  I'll
[3332.74 --> 3332.86]  never
[3332.86 --> 3333.04]  do
[3333.04 --> 3333.26]  that
[3333.26 --> 3333.64]  again
[3333.64 --> 3334.58]  no
[3334.58 --> 3334.82]  no
[3334.82 --> 3335.08]  no
[3335.08 --> 3335.10]  no
[3335.10 --> 3336.00]  that's
[3336.00 --> 3336.16]  not
[3336.16 --> 3336.34]  what
[3336.34 --> 3336.56]  God
[3336.56 --> 3336.94]  created
[3336.94 --> 3337.22]  us
[3337.22 --> 3337.40]  to
[3337.40 --> 3337.72]  be
[3337.72 --> 3339.22]  he said
[3339.22 --> 3339.34]  it
[3339.34 --> 3339.48]  was
[3339.48 --> 3339.86]  good
[3339.86 --> 3341.32]  God
[3341.32 --> 3341.84]  created
[3341.84 --> 3342.14]  you
[3342.14 --> 3342.30]  and
[3342.30 --> 3342.40]  it
[3342.40 --> 3342.56]  was
[3342.56 --> 3343.12]  good
[3343.12 --> 3344.64]  and
[3344.64 --> 3344.78]  he
[3344.78 --> 3345.46]  prepared
[3345.46 --> 3346.20]  things
[3346.20 --> 3346.48]  in
[3346.48 --> 3347.12]  advance
[3347.12 --> 3347.80]  for

[3348.12 --> 3348.40]  to
[3348.40 --> 3348.78]  do
[3348.78 --> 3350.08]  and
[3350.08 --> 3350.24]  he
[3350.24 --> 3350.68]  gifted
[3350.68 --> 3351.00]  you
[3351.00 --> 3351.24]  to
[3351.24 --> 3351.48]  do
[3351.48 --> 3351.74]  it
[3351.74 --> 3353.32]  and
[3353.32 --> 3353.48]  it
[3353.48 --> 3353.70]  was
[3353.70 --> 3354.14]  good
[3356.86 --> 3358.94]  years
[3358.94 --> 3359.78]  in

[3360.48 --> 3360.80]  and
[3360.80 --> 3361.18]  ministry
[3361.18 --> 3361.84]  years
[3361.84 --> 3362.28]  in

[3363.14 --> 3363.54]  pews
[3363.54 --> 3364.26]  years

[3365.96 --> 3366.10]  the
[3366.10 --> 3366.64]  community
[3366.64 --> 3367.58]  don't
[3367.58 --> 3368.32]  necessarily
[3368.32 --> 3369.16]  overcome
[3369.16 --> 3369.72]  that
[3369.72 --> 3370.36]  personal
[3370.36 --> 3371.64]  hesitancy
[3371.64 --> 3372.74]  unless
[3372.74 --> 3373.06]  we
[3373.06 --> 3373.90]  choose
[3373.90 --> 3374.56]  to

[3476.60 --> 3477.16]  carve
[3477.16 --> 3477.46]  or
[3477.46 --> 3478.26]  at least

[3494.26 --> 3495.74]  but
[3495.74 --> 3496.04]  if we
[3496.04 --> 3496.44]  look at
[3496.44 --> 3496.78]  that
[3496.78 --> 3497.74]  and learn
[3497.74 --> 3498.00]  from
[3498.00 --> 3498.24]  it
[3498.24 --> 3499.24]  what

[3500.94 --> 3501.38]  create
[3501.38 --> 3502.06]  community
[3502.06 --> 3503.32]  well
[3503.32 --> 3503.70]  the raw

[3517.12 --> 3520.84]  now we
[3520.84 --> 3521.32]  must use
[3521.32 --> 3522.22]  certain tools
[3522.22 --> 3523.04]  appropriate to
[3523.04 --> 3523.72]  the task
[3523.72 --> 3524.82]  such as a
[3524.82 --> 3526.12]  sharp knife
[3526.12 --> 3526.96]  for carving
[3526.96 --> 3529.32]  and it's one
[3529.32 --> 3529.52]  of the
[3529.52 --> 3530.48]  interesting things
[3530.48 --> 3530.90]  that people
[3530.90 --> 3531.28]  see that
[3531.28 --> 3531.54]  oh
[3531.54 --> 3532.76]  that's dangerous
[3532.76 --> 3533.36]  don't touch
[3533.36 --> 3533.72]  that
[3533.72 --> 3534.48]  it'll hurt
[3534.48 --> 3534.80]  you
[3534.80 --> 3536.74]  and it will
[3536.74 --> 3537.82]  it can
[3537.82 --> 3539.38]  but that's why
[3539.38 --> 3540.12]  you have to learn
[3540.12 --> 3540.74]  to handle
[3540.74 --> 3541.34]  the tool
[3541.34 --> 3542.10]  to know
[3542.10 --> 3542.94]  how to use
[3542.94 --> 3543.38]  the tool
[3543.38 --> 3544.10]  appropriately
[3544.10 --> 3545.00]  and
[3545.00 --> 3545.94]  to an
[3545.94 --> 3546.42]  effective
[3546.42 --> 3548.04]  end result
[3548.04 --> 3549.84]  and yes
[3549.84 --> 3551.60]  it's actually
[3551.60 --> 3552.18]  safer
[3552.18 --> 3552.98]  to be
[3552.98 --> 3553.58]  really
[3553.58 --> 3554.20]  sharp
[3554.20 --> 3555.00]  so you
[3555.00 --> 3555.54]  keep your
[3555.54 --> 3556.06]  tools
[3556.06 --> 3557.06]  honed
[3557.06 --> 3557.68]  sharp
[3557.68 --> 3559.14]  even if
[3559.14 --> 3559.44]  you do
[3559.44 --> 3559.92]  get cut
[3559.92 --> 3560.28]  it's a
[3560.28 --> 3560.96]  clean cut
[3560.96 --> 3561.68]  and it
[3561.68 --> 3561.98]  heals
[3561.98 --> 3562.52]  quickly
[3562.52 --> 3563.76]  if you
[3563.76 --> 3564.22]  let your
[3564.22 --> 3564.72]  blade
[3564.72 --> 3565.40]  go dull
[3565.40 --> 3565.78]  and you
[3565.78 --> 3566.04]  cut
[3566.04 --> 3566.46]  yourself
[3566.46 --> 3567.12]  you rip
[3567.12 --> 3568.36]  it open
[3568.36 --> 3569.22]  and it
[3569.22 --> 3569.60]  takes a
[3569.60 --> 3569.84]  longer
[3569.84 --> 3570.26]  time
[3570.26 --> 3570.78]  to heal
[3570.78 --> 3572.64]  strange
[3572.64 --> 3572.94]  little
[3572.94 --> 3573.40]  things
[3573.40 --> 3573.76]  that we
[3573.76 --> 3574.78]  think the
[3574.78 --> 3575.16]  opposite
[3575.16 --> 3575.56]  way
[3575.56 --> 3576.26]  but
[3576.26 --> 3576.86]  actually
[3576.86 --> 3579.20]  that's what
[3579.20 --> 3579.60]  God is
[3579.60 --> 3580.04]  trying to
[3580.04 --> 3580.42]  get us
[3580.42 --> 3581.16]  to understand
[3581.16 --> 3582.00]  in the
[3582.00 --> 3582.32]  working
[3582.32 --> 3582.82]  that he's
[3582.82 --> 3583.10]  doing
[3583.10 --> 3583.60]  in us
[3583.60 --> 3586.64]  so
[3586.64 --> 3588.44]  the raw
[3588.44 --> 3588.96]  material
[3588.96 --> 3590.42]  the tool
[3590.42 --> 3592.42]  we must
[3592.42 --> 3592.94]  make sure
[3592.94 --> 3593.84]  it's honed
[3593.84 --> 3594.42]  properly
[3594.42 --> 3595.38]  and we
[3595.38 --> 3595.82]  must
[3595.82 --> 3596.52]  know
[3596.52 --> 3597.38]  the skills
[3597.38 --> 3598.12]  to use
[3598.12 --> 3598.28]  it
[3598.28 --> 3598.88]  effectively
[3598.88 --> 3600.22]  and efficiently
[3600.22 --> 3602.78]  the vision
[3602.78 --> 3603.12]  of the
[3603.12 --> 3603.84]  end result
[3603.84 --> 3605.52]  well
[3605.52 --> 3612.82]  it's a
[3612.82 --> 3613.44]  process
[3613.44 --> 3615.36]  so a
[3615.36 --> 3615.76]  piece of
[3615.76 --> 3616.06]  wood
[3616.06 --> 3617.52]  that
[3617.52 --> 3618.20]  takes on
[3618.20 --> 3618.56]  a little
[3618.56 --> 3618.86]  bit
[3618.86 --> 3619.50]  of
[3619.50 --> 3620.08]  shape
[3620.08 --> 3621.08]  as you
[3621.08 --> 3621.42]  go
[3621.42 --> 3622.46]  and as
[3622.46 --> 3622.58]  you
[3622.58 --> 3623.22]  imagine
[3623.22 --> 3624.10]  or as
[3624.10 --> 3625.08]  the
[3625.08 --> 3625.86]  imagination
[3625.86 --> 3627.46]  perhaps
[3627.46 --> 3628.36]  the guidance
[3628.36 --> 3628.78]  of the
[3628.78 --> 3629.30]  spirit
[3629.30 --> 3631.70]  tells us
[3631.70 --> 3632.48]  to do
[3632.48 --> 3632.96]  this
[3632.96 --> 3633.74]  move
[3633.74 --> 3634.16]  in that
[3634.16 --> 3634.50]  way
[3634.50 --> 3635.50]  handle
[3635.50 --> 3635.76]  it
[3635.76 --> 3636.42]  in a
[3636.42 --> 3636.74]  certain
[3636.74 --> 3637.26]  manner
[3637.26 --> 3638.18]  oh
[3638.18 --> 3638.60]  maybe
[3638.60 --> 3638.88]  you
[3638.88 --> 3639.02]  could
[3639.02 --> 3639.24]  add
[3639.24 --> 3639.56]  this
[3639.56 --> 3639.80]  to
[3639.80 --> 3639.98]  it
[3639.98 --> 3640.40]  instead
[3640.40 --> 3643.50]  when we
[3643.50 --> 3643.82]  create
[3643.82 --> 3644.48]  communities
[3644.48 --> 3645.74]  the work
[3645.74 --> 3646.40]  of God
[3646.40 --> 3647.62]  calling
[3647.62 --> 3648.00]  people
[3648.00 --> 3648.46]  together
[3648.46 --> 3650.34]  we work
[3650.34 --> 3650.82]  with each
[3650.82 --> 3651.12]  other
[3651.12 --> 3652.38]  to make
[3652.38 --> 3652.82]  something
[3652.82 --> 3653.32]  beautiful
[3653.32 --> 3655.36]  many
[3655.36 --> 3655.84]  people
[3655.84 --> 3657.32]  many
[3657.32 --> 3657.84]  hands
[3657.84 --> 3657.98]  are
[3657.98 --> 3658.58]  involved
[3658.58 --> 3659.62]  and so
[3659.62 --> 3660.02]  we need
[3660.02 --> 3660.36]  to know
[3660.36 --> 3660.68]  how to
[3660.68 --> 3660.98]  do it
[3660.98 --> 3661.26]  well
[3661.26 --> 3661.72]  by the
[3661.72 --> 3662.16]  guidance
[3662.16 --> 3662.90]  of the
[3662.90 --> 3663.10]  Holy
[3663.10 --> 3663.50]  Spirit
[3663.50 --> 3665.84]  now
[3665.84 --> 3667.24]  it might
[3667.24 --> 3667.54]  get a
[3667.54 --> 3667.82]  little bit
[3667.82 --> 3668.20]  messy
[3668.20 --> 3669.60]  when you're
[3669.60 --> 3669.92]  creating
[3669.92 --> 3670.34]  something
[3670.34 --> 3670.80]  beautiful
[3670.80 --> 3672.48]  when you
[3672.48 --> 3672.84]  carve
[3672.84 --> 3673.50]  and you're
[3673.50 --> 3673.92]  carving
[3673.92 --> 3674.94]  oh
[3674.94 --> 3675.36]  in the
[3675.36 --> 3676.98]  living room
[3676.98 --> 3677.76]  in your
[3677.76 --> 3678.60]  favorite chair
[3678.60 --> 3679.86]  and the
[3679.86 --> 3680.30]  carving
[3680.30 --> 3681.10]  chips
[3681.10 --> 3682.34]  get all
[3682.34 --> 3682.78]  around
[3682.78 --> 3683.04]  you
[3683.04 --> 3683.28]  and
[3683.28 --> 3683.82]  oh
[3683.82 --> 3684.02]  no
[3684.02 --> 3684.26]  they're
[3684.26 --> 3684.54]  falling
[3684.54 --> 3684.88]  on the
[3684.88 --> 3685.24]  carpet
[3685.24 --> 3686.10]  oh
[3686.10 --> 3686.28]  they're
[3686.28 --> 3686.54]  in the
[3686.54 --> 3686.86]  chair
[3686.86 --> 3687.74]  oh
[3687.74 --> 3687.96]  they're
[3687.96 --> 3688.10]  all
[3688.10 --> 3688.32]  over
[3688.32 --> 3688.68]  me
[3688.68 --> 3689.68]  what
[3689.68 --> 3689.80]  am
[3689.80 --> 3689.90]  I
[3689.90 --> 3690.04]  going
[3690.04 --> 3690.16]  to
[3690.16 --> 3690.44]  do
[3690.44 --> 3690.76]  well
[3690.76 --> 3691.02]  I've
[3691.02 --> 3691.12]  got
[3691.12 --> 3691.24]  to
[3691.24 --> 3691.48]  clean
[3691.48 --> 3691.66]  it
[3691.66 --> 3691.96]  up
[3691.96 --> 3692.82]  but
[3692.82 --> 3693.22]  somebody
[3693.22 --> 3693.40]  is
[3693.40 --> 3693.54]  going
[3693.54 --> 3693.68]  to
[3693.68 --> 3693.92]  say
[3693.92 --> 3694.60]  perhaps
[3694.60 --> 3695.84]  go
[3695.84 --> 3696.26]  somewhere
[3696.26 --> 3696.58]  else
[3696.58 --> 3696.78]  and
[3696.78 --> 3696.96]  do
[3696.96 --> 3697.36]  that
[3697.36 --> 3698.22]  don't
[3698.22 --> 3698.42]  make
[3698.42 --> 3698.58]  a
[3698.58 --> 3698.98]  mess
[3698.98 --> 3700.06]  on
[3700.06 --> 3700.26]  my
[3700.26 --> 3700.72]  carpet
[3700.72 --> 3704.28]  that's
[3704.28 --> 3704.48]  about
[3704.48 --> 3704.92]  carving
[3704.92 --> 3705.64]  what
[3705.64 --> 3705.86]  about
[3705.86 --> 3706.24]  creating
[3706.24 --> 3707.00]  community
[3707.00 --> 3708.92]  welcoming
[3708.92 --> 3709.44]  people
[3709.44 --> 3709.62]  with
[3709.62 --> 3710.24]  disabilities
[3710.24 --> 3712.12]  don't
[3712.12 --> 3712.26]  do
[3712.26 --> 3712.42]  that
[3712.42 --> 3712.70]  in my
[3712.70 --> 3713.12]  backyard
[3713.12 --> 3714.26]  I'm
[3714.26 --> 3714.44]  not
[3714.44 --> 3714.84]  comfortable
[3714.84 --> 3715.12]  with
[3715.12 --> 3715.36]  that
[3715.36 --> 3715.74]  go
[3715.74 --> 3715.92]  do
[3715.92 --> 3716.12]  that
[3716.12 --> 3716.44]  somewhere
[3716.44 --> 3716.88]  else
[3716.88 --> 3719.36]  how
[3719.36 --> 3719.64]  about
[3719.64 --> 3720.44]  working
[3720.44 --> 3720.70]  with
[3720.70 --> 3721.04]  people
[3721.04 --> 3721.26]  that
[3721.26 --> 3721.50]  don't
[3721.50 --> 3721.70]  know
[3721.70 --> 3721.90]  the
[3721.90 --> 3722.32]  faith
[3722.32 --> 3724.08]  well
[3724.08 --> 3726.66]  we
[3726.66 --> 3726.92]  don't
[3726.92 --> 3727.18]  know
[3727.18 --> 3727.58]  how to
[3727.58 --> 3728.30]  what
[3728.30 --> 3728.52]  we're
[3728.52 --> 3728.62]  going
[3728.62 --> 3728.72]  to
[3728.72 --> 3728.88]  do
[3728.88 --> 3729.02]  and
[3729.02 --> 3729.20]  how
[3729.20 --> 3729.34]  we're
[3729.34 --> 3729.50]  going

[3729.66 --> 3729.84]  do
[3729.84 --> 3730.00]  it
[3730.00 --> 3730.56]  just
[3730.56 --> 3730.78]  do
[3730.78 --> 3731.02]  it
[3731.02 --> 3732.10]  God
[3732.10 --> 3732.26]  will
[3732.26 --> 3732.44]  give
[3732.44 --> 3732.52]  you
[3732.52 --> 3732.68]  the
[3732.68 --> 3733.08]  words
[3733.08 --> 3734.10]  God
[3734.10 --> 3734.26]  will
[3734.26 --> 3734.56]  speak
[3734.56 --> 3734.80]  through
[3734.80 --> 3735.02]  you
[3735.02 --> 3735.36]  by
[3735.36 --> 3735.58]  your
[3735.58 --> 3736.06]  actions
[3736.06 --> 3736.50]  by
[3736.50 --> 3736.74]  your
[3736.74 --> 3737.20]  openness
[3737.20 --> 3737.88]  to
[3737.88 --> 3739.60]  allow
[3739.60 --> 3740.16]  people
[3740.16 --> 3741.26]  to hear
[3741.26 --> 3741.64]  the word
[3741.64 --> 3742.12]  of God
[3742.12 --> 3744.34]  don't
[3744.34 --> 3744.54]  worry
[3744.54 --> 3744.78]  about
[3744.78 --> 3744.96]  the
[3744.96 --> 3745.22]  mess
[3745.22 --> 3745.40]  you
[3745.40 --> 3745.72]  make
[3745.72 --> 3747.14]  God
[3747.14 --> 3747.32]  will
[3747.32 --> 3747.56]  work
[3747.56 --> 3747.88]  within
[3747.88 --> 3748.20]  you
[3748.20 --> 3751.44]  so
[3751.44 --> 3751.60]  we
[3751.60 --> 3751.76]  have
[3751.76 --> 3751.88]  to
[3751.88 --> 3752.10]  clean
[3752.10 --> 3752.40]  up
[3752.40 --> 3752.94]  after
[3752.94 --> 3753.14]  the
[3753.14 --> 3753.48]  job
[3753.48 --> 3754.14]  no
[3754.14 --> 3754.56]  problem
[3754.56 --> 3755.20]  clean
[3755.20 --> 3755.36]  it
[3755.36 --> 3755.62]  up
[3755.62 --> 3756.96]  and
[3756.96 --> 3757.10]  then
[3757.10 --> 3757.42]  start
[3757.42 --> 3757.70]  over
[3757.70 --> 3758.10]  again

[4497.90 --> 4500.12]  and his
[4500.12 --> 4500.84]  love
[4500.84 --> 4516.02]  sometimes we just have to be a little bit spontaneous
[4516.02 --> 4517.52]  right
[4517.52 --> 4524.74]  before we go into our prayer together
[4524.74 --> 4531.06]  just found out this morning that Connie is in hospital and she is quite ill
[4531.06 --> 4534.02]  she is undergoing tests
[4534.02 --> 4536.40]  right now
[4536.40 --> 4539.94]  and so we will pray for her as well in our prayers for the people
[4539.94 --> 4541.42]  please pray with me
[4541.42 --> 4545.14]  Lord of heaven and earth
[4545.14 --> 4547.20]  we approach you boldly
[4547.20 --> 4548.58]  as trusting children
[4548.58 --> 4550.52]  approach their loving parent
[4550.52 --> 4556.54]  we cannot begin to fathom your love for us and your delight in spending time with us
[4556.54 --> 4558.92]  forgive us when we trifle
[4558.92 --> 4560.52]  in our worship of you
[4560.52 --> 4564.10]  give us sincere hearts that are faithful and true
[4564.10 --> 4567.52]  we thank you for your continued care
[4567.52 --> 4569.80]  and praise you for hearing our prayers
[4569.80 --> 4572.04]  for the safe arrival of Evelyn Grace
[4572.04 --> 4573.78]  to Jason, Michaela
[4573.78 --> 4574.52]  and William
[4574.52 --> 4577.98]  what joy the miracle of new life brings
[4577.98 --> 4580.48]  continue to bless this family
[4580.48 --> 4583.02]  may they flourish together in love
[4583.02 --> 4586.98]  thank you for all the children who are part of our church family
[4586.98 --> 4591.98]  may they come to know you as the rock on which their lives are built
[4591.98 --> 4595.38]  cradle all our families in your hands
[4595.38 --> 4600.10]  so that any conflicts may be resolved and wounds healed
[4600.10 --> 4604.86]  teach us how to cultivate soft hearts towards one another
[4604.86 --> 4609.10]  thank you for this church and its pastors
[4609.10 --> 4610.44]  Jason and Nancy
[4610.44 --> 4613.42]  give them wisdom and passion in their work
[4613.42 --> 4617.92]  may we be encouraging towards them as they minister among us
[4617.92 --> 4619.54]  may your word go out
[4619.54 --> 4621.86]  all around the world today
[4621.86 --> 4624.26]  so that your kingdom comes near
[4624.26 --> 4628.96]  thank you for what we heard this morning from Pastor Dan
[4628.96 --> 4633.36]  may your word accomplish what you've sent it to do in each of us
[4633.36 --> 4638.10]  we pray for Christians persecuted in so many countries
[4638.10 --> 4642.04]  strengthen and multiply the church through them
[4642.04 --> 4647.68]  thank you for healing that you provide when we are weak
[4647.68 --> 4652.58]  we struggle with physical, mental and spiritual frailties
[4652.58 --> 4654.60]  but you provide healing
[4654.60 --> 4657.14]  in ways we often don't hear about
[4657.14 --> 4659.28]  and sometimes in ways we don't expect
[4659.28 --> 4662.60]  and when it seems like healing doesn't come
[4662.60 --> 4665.00]  you are with us in our waiting
[4665.00 --> 4667.72]  this morning we pray for Connie
[4667.72 --> 4670.78]  and we pray that you'll be with her in the hospital
[4670.78 --> 4674.18]  as testing is done and treatment given
[4674.18 --> 4677.44]  Lord will you be with her medical team
[4677.44 --> 4680.60]  and keep her close to you in this as well
[4680.60 --> 4684.54]  thank you for gifting us with medical professionals
[4684.54 --> 4687.68]  who are compassionate and excel in their tasks
[4687.68 --> 4691.08]  we pray for safety for them in the work
[4691.08 --> 4694.82]  that can present very real danger
[4694.82 --> 4698.58]  we pray for those among us who have had recent surgeries
[4698.58 --> 4700.52]  and for their healing
[4700.52 --> 4703.54]  for those who are confined to hospital
[4703.54 --> 4707.20]  or care homes or simply at home
[4707.20 --> 4711.14]  give patience and precious moments of knowing your nearness
[4711.14 --> 4716.14]  King of Kings, we pray for nations in conflict
[4716.14 --> 4719.16]  we pray for justice and peace
[4719.16 --> 4720.96]  and that wars may cease
[4720.96 --> 4725.10]  that displaced persons may be able to return home again
[4725.10 --> 4727.10]  we pray for the peace
[4727.10 --> 4731.10]  we pray that leaders may be wise in decisions that affect their citizens
[4731.10 --> 4733.30]  may they be peace loving
[4733.30 --> 4734.54]  compassionate
