[880.96 → 882.96] Let's sing together.
[882.96 → 894.96] He was little, weak, and helpless, tears and smells like a sea hill.
[894.96 → 907.96] And He feels for all our sadness, and He sheds in all our gladness.
[907.96 → 920.96] And the eyes of God shall see, through His whole redeeming love.
[920.96 → 933.96] For that love so dear and gentle, is our love in love above.
[933.96 → 947.96] And He leads His children on to the place where He has gone.
[947.96 → 977.96] 
[977.96 → 989.96] Son of righteousness arise, and triumph for these chains of mine.
[989.96 → 997.96] Come now, love, or wait to die.
[997.96 → 1003.96] Bring the fullness of Your love.
[1003.96 → 1009.96] And this is not bound up by shame.
[1009.96 → 1015.96] And I will never be the same.
[1015.96 → 1027.96] So here I wake in hope of You, all my souls walking through and through.
[1027.96 → 1041.96] And days will all my life be near, and days are in my heart of me.
[1041.96 → 1053.96] Dark and chill is the morn, until Your love in me is born.
[1053.96 → 1065.96] And joy is in deep in His heart, until Emmanuel is born.
[1065.96 → 1077.96] And days will all my life be near, and days are in my heart of me.
[1077.96 → 1087.96] And days will all my life be near, and days are in my heart of me.
[1087.96 → 1093.96] So here I wake in hope of You, all my souls walking through and through.
[1093.96 → 1111.96] And days will all my life be near, and days will all my life be near.
[1111.96 → 1131.96] And days will all my life be near, and days will all my life be near.
[1131.96 → 1137.96] The Old Testament scripture reading today is Deuteronomy 34, verses 1 through 12.
[1137.96 → 1147.96] This can be found on page 157 of your Pew Bible.
[1147.96 → 1149.96] The death of Moses.
[1149.96 → 1157.96] Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho.
[1157.96 → 1167.96] There the Lord showed him the whole land from Gilead to Dan, all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh,
[1167.96 → 1181.96] all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, the Negev, and the whole region of the Valley of Jericho, the city of Palms, as far as For.
[1181.96 → 1192.96] Then the Lord said to him, This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when I said, I will give it to your descendants.
[1192.96 → 1199.96] I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over into it.
[1199.96 → 1206.96] And Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in Moab, as the Lord had said.
[1206.96 → 1215.96] He buried him in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Poor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
[1217.96 → 1225.96] Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, nor his strength gone.
[1225.96 → 1234.96] The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
[1234.96 → 1242.96] Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him.
[1242.96 → 1248.96] So the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses.
[1248.96 → 1266.96] Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, who did all those signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do in Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.
[1266.96 → 1276.96] For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
[1276.96 → 1278.96] This is the word of the Lord.
[1278.96 → 1284.96] Thanks be to God.
[1284.96 → 1288.96] For our time of confession this morning, I would like to offer this prayer.
[1288.96 → 1292.96] Please pray with me.
[1292.96 → 1296.96] Lord, we have not kept watch for you.
[1296.96 → 1300.96] We have occupied ourselves with our own concerns.
[1300.96 → 1304.96] We have not waited to find your will for us.
[1304.96 → 1308.96] We have not noticed the needs of the people around us.
[1308.96 → 1312.96] We have not acknowledged the love that has been shown to us.
[1312.96 → 1318.96] Forgive us for our lack of watchfulness.
[1318.96 → 1321.96] Help us to know your will.
[1321.96 → 1324.96] Help us to look out for the needs of others.
[1324.96 → 1328.96] Help us to work and watch for your coming.
[1328.96 → 1332.96] Amen.
[1332.96 → 1336.96] And our assurance is this.
[1336.96 → 1342.96] The good news of this Advent season is forgiveness of sin and new life.
[1342.96 → 1348.96] Let us commit our lives to Christ's way of hope and peace.
[1348.96 → 1357.96] Thanks be to the Advent God who comes among us, setting us free to love and serve.
[1357.96 → 1367.96] Our song of response is an old, old hymn written in the 1400s on Jordan's banks, the Baptist's cry.
[1367.96 → 1372.96] Please stand.
[1372.96 → 1388.96] On Jordan's banks the Baptist's cry.
[1388.96 → 1398.96] And now sing that the Lord is born.
[1398.96 → 1408.96] Awake and walk and forth He brings the tidings of the King of kings.
[1408.96 → 1413.96] And cleanse me every life from sin.
[1413.96 → 1418.96] Make safe away for God within.
[1418.96 → 1429.96] And let us all our hearts prepare for Christ to come and enter there.
[1429.96 → 1435.96] We hail you as our Saviour, Lord.
[1435.96 → 1439.96] Our refuge and our strength reward.
[1439.96 → 1444.96] Without your grace we waste away.
[1444.96 → 1450.96] Like those that build our ending day.
[1450.96 → 1451.96] meal no.
[1451.96 → 1452.96] Love room full sun
[1452.96 → 1453.96] Thanks be to Jesus, the Lord.
[1453.96 → 1455.96] joining us shall come and O Lord chigger, Amen.
[1455.96 → 1456.64] 與我們都口贈り合我們
[1456.64 → 1457.96] 3ど into tithe
[1457.96 → 1460.96] ổера 之下
[1460.96 → 1462.28] loves
[1462.28 → 1462.76] Share affirm
[1462.76 → 1463.80] shan't
[1463.80 → 1468.84] Love rest
[1468.84 → 1469.00] 현
[1469.00 → 1472.20] and love divine
[1472.20 → 1477.94] all praise to you eternal son
[1477.94 → 1482.84] whose advent has our freedom won
[1482.84 → 1487.80] the world of father we adore
[1487.80 → 1490.88] and Holy Spirit
[1490.88 → 1494.52] nevermore
[1494.52 → 1497.24] please be seated
[1499.00 → 1507.78] so let's pray for the children
[1507.78 → 1509.68] and their teachers as they go out
[1509.68 → 1510.94] please pray with me
[1510.94 → 1513.76] father we ask for your blessing upon the children
[1513.76 → 1516.60] that you'd shine the light of your face upon them
[1516.60 → 1518.20] and that they might know you
[1518.20 → 1522.04] and bless lord the teachers as they bring god's word to the children
[1522.04 → 1523.64] we pray in Christ's name amen
[1523.64 → 1540.08] good morning to you all
[1540.08 → 1544.42] so as BEV already said this is the fourth Sunday
[1544.42 → 1546.16] of the church season of advent
[1546.16 → 1551.98] and advent is the season when the church thinks about our waiting
[1551.98 → 1554.84] and to help us do that
[1554.84 → 1558.72] this year we are looking at some of the Old Testament saints
[1558.72 → 1560.72] who came before us
[1560.72 → 1562.72] who were also waiting
[1562.72 → 1566.24] right they waited for the messiah to come the first time
[1566.24 → 1569.48] and that really happened at Christmas
[1569.48 → 1572.52] god's son came into the world
[1572.52 → 1574.62] born as a baby
[1574.62 → 1576.56] as little and helpless
[1576.56 → 1578.72] as any other baby
[1578.72 → 1581.66] and these ancient believers
[1581.66 → 1584.02] are commended by god
[1584.02 → 1585.22] for their faith
[1585.22 → 1587.36] right for how they trusted god
[1587.36 → 1588.70] and how they acted on it
[1588.70 → 1590.82] and we are looking
[1590.82 → 1593.62] to see how their faith
[1593.62 → 1596.20] can be an example for us
[1596.20 → 1597.90] in our own time of waiting
[1597.90 → 1600.28] for Jesus to come again
[1600.28 → 1601.40] when he will come
[1601.40 → 1603.12] to renew all things
[1603.12 → 1605.44] and so as we continue today
[1605.44 → 1606.90] through Hebrews chapter 11
[1606.90 → 1609.08] through this list of the heroes of faith
[1609.08 → 1609.72] this week
[1609.72 → 1611.20] we look to Moses
[1611.20 → 1613.16] so I invite you
[1613.16 → 1614.64] if you'd like to turn with me
[1614.64 → 1615.70] in your bibles
[1615.70 → 1618.46] to Hebrews chapter 11
[1618.46 → 1620.96] we'll also have the scripture
[1620.96 → 1623.00] up on the screen
[1623.00 → 1623.62] in front of you
[1623.62 → 1625.04] and uh
[1625.04 → 1626.06] excuse me
[1626.06 → 1628.80] so we're going to actually look at
[1628.80 → 1629.88] uh
[1629.88 → 1631.16] verses 1 to 2
[1631.16 → 1632.84] of Hebrews chapter 11
[1632.84 → 1635.64] and then jump to the section of Moses
[1635.64 → 1636.22] beginning
[1636.22 → 1638.26] in verse 24
[1638.26 → 1641.64] so we'll begin with verses 1 and 2
[1641.64 → 1643.56] now faith
[1643.56 → 1645.32] is being sure
[1645.32 → 1647.10] of what we hope for
[1647.10 → 1648.56] and certain
[1648.56 → 1651.12] of what we do not see
[1651.12 → 1653.72] this is what the ancients
[1653.72 → 1655.58] were commended for
[1655.58 → 1658.06] then verse 24
[1658.06 → 1660.26] by faith Moses
[1660.26 → 1661.54] when he had grown up
[1661.54 → 1662.88] refused to be known
[1662.88 → 1664.78] as the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1664.78 → 1667.00] he chose to be mistreated
[1667.00 → 1668.74] along with the people of god
[1668.74 → 1670.38] rather than to enjoy
[1670.38 → 1671.56] the pleasures of sin
[1671.56 → 1672.56] for a short time
[1672.56 → 1675.54] he regarded disgrace
[1675.54 → 1677.00] for the sake of Christ
[1677.00 → 1678.60] as of greater value
[1678.60 → 1679.98] than the treasures of Egypt
[1679.98 → 1682.18] because he was looking ahead
[1682.18 → 1683.58] to his reward
[1683.58 → 1686.04] by faith he left Egypt
[1686.04 → 1687.40] not fearing the king's anger
[1687.40 → 1689.10] he persevered
[1689.10 → 1690.28] because he saw him
[1690.28 → 1691.54] who is invisible
[1691.54 → 1694.32] by faith he kept the passover
[1694.32 → 1696.10] and the sprinkling of blood
[1696.10 → 1697.70] so that the destroyer
[1697.70 → 1698.50] of the firstborn
[1698.50 → 1699.72] would not touch
[1699.72 → 1701.12] the firstborn of Israel
[1701.12 → 1702.74] by faith the people
[1702.74 → 1704.08] passed through the Red Sea
[1704.08 → 1705.52] as on dry land
[1705.52 → 1707.08] but when the Egyptians
[1707.08 → 1707.94] tried to do so
[1707.94 → 1709.24] they were drowned
[1709.24 → 1711.06] this is the word of the lord
[1711.06 → 1713.96] so lets uh
[1713.96 → 1714.76] come before the lord
[1714.76 → 1715.62] in prayer together
[1715.62 → 1716.96] as we ask for his blessing
[1716.96 → 1718.30] upon his word
[1718.30 → 1718.90] this morning
[1718.90 → 1719.46] let's pray
[1719.46 → 1722.84] lord our god
[1722.84 → 1723.60] we thank you
[1723.60 → 1724.44] this morning
[1724.44 → 1725.26] for your word
[1725.26 → 1726.66] and as we come
[1726.66 → 1727.54] to worship you lord
[1727.54 → 1728.66] we know that many
[1728.66 → 1729.42] will perhaps
[1729.42 → 1730.84] enter through the doors
[1730.84 → 1732.48] of churches
[1732.48 → 1733.88] this holiday season
[1733.88 → 1735.36] and for
[1735.36 → 1736.32] and for all those
[1736.32 → 1736.98] who come
[1736.98 → 1738.30] through the doors here
[1738.30 → 1741.04] may we welcome them
[1741.04 → 1743.34] as Christ has welcomed us
[1743.34 → 1745.58] and lord may they also
[1745.58 → 1746.26] be confronted
[1746.26 → 1748.36] as we all must be
[1748.36 → 1749.64] with the true saviour
[1749.64 → 1750.44] Jesus Christ
[1750.44 → 1751.98] the son of god
[1751.98 → 1753.16] who came to dwell
[1753.16 → 1753.92] among us
[1753.92 → 1755.44] to rescue sinners
[1755.44 → 1757.08] and it's in his name
[1757.08 → 1757.60] that we pray
[1757.60 → 1758.72] amen
[1758.72 → 1762.56] and so Christmas
[1762.56 → 1763.60] is almost here
[1763.60 → 1766.20] and people have
[1766.20 → 1767.12] a lot of traditions
[1767.12 → 1768.62] this time of year
[1768.62 → 1770.04] right we prepare
[1770.04 → 1771.92] for holiday meals
[1771.92 → 1773.56] we um
[1773.56 → 1774.78] buy or perhaps
[1774.78 → 1775.42] even make
[1775.42 → 1776.28] presents
[1776.28 → 1777.20] to give to others
[1777.20 → 1777.84] and we decorate
[1777.84 → 1778.60] the Christmas tree
[1778.60 → 1780.06] and another
[1780.06 → 1780.98] of these traditions
[1780.98 → 1781.56] is that
[1781.56 → 1782.80] a lot of children
[1782.80 → 1783.62] what do they do
[1783.62 → 1786.02] they write letters
[1786.02 → 1787.62] to Santa Claus
[1787.62 → 1790.46] and you know
[1790.46 → 1791.62] what's in those letters
[1791.62 → 1792.64] right
[1792.64 → 1793.64] children are telling
[1793.64 → 1794.08] Santa
[1794.08 → 1796.20] what they want
[1796.20 → 1797.40] for Christmas
[1797.40 → 1798.32] right
[1798.32 → 1799.16] they tell him
[1799.16 → 1800.24] what they want
[1800.24 → 1800.96] because
[1800.96 → 1803.72] it is what they think
[1803.72 → 1804.76] will make them happy
[1804.76 → 1807.24] and so I looked up
[1807.24 → 1809.20] some information
[1809.20 → 1810.18] on the internet
[1810.18 → 1811.56] about the state
[1811.56 → 1812.36] of happiness
[1812.36 → 1813.22] in the world
[1813.22 → 1813.64] today
[1813.64 → 1815.70] and you know
[1815.70 → 1816.42] people actually
[1816.42 → 1817.94] do surveys
[1817.94 → 1819.14] on this kind of things
[1819.14 → 1819.88] and I learned that
[1819.88 → 1821.42] among 30 countries
[1821.42 → 1822.80] where they did the survey
[1822.80 → 1825.46] 71 percent of people
[1825.46 → 1826.48] say they are happy
[1826.48 → 1829.40] and there are
[1829.40 → 1830.74] many things
[1830.74 → 1832.14] that make people happy
[1832.14 → 1832.42] right
[1832.42 → 1832.98] um
[1832.98 → 1834.14] and so actually
[1834.14 → 1835.22] older generations
[1835.22 → 1836.62] are more likely
[1836.62 → 1837.70] to say that family
[1837.70 → 1839.36] is what makes them happy
[1839.36 → 1841.68] among younger generations
[1841.68 → 1842.56] it is
[1842.56 → 1844.00] feeling appreciated
[1844.00 → 1846.00] and yet
[1846.00 → 1846.90] there are still
[1846.90 → 1847.94] many people in the world
[1847.94 → 1849.16] who are unhappy
[1849.16 → 1850.02] right
[1850.02 → 1851.34] we live in a very lonely
[1851.34 → 1852.88] and sad
[1852.88 → 1854.32] and anxious world
[1854.32 → 1856.46] and so I have a question
[1856.48 → 1857.36] for you this morning
[1857.36 → 1859.34] I want you to imagine
[1859.34 → 1860.38] that you are asked
[1860.38 → 1861.46] to write a letter
[1861.46 → 1863.72] not to Santa Claus
[1863.72 → 1865.22] but to god
[1865.22 → 1867.84] you are asked
[1867.84 → 1869.68] to write a one-page letter
[1869.68 → 1871.24] that begins
[1871.24 → 1872.18] dear god
[1872.18 → 1873.92] here is what
[1873.92 → 1875.46] will make me happy
[1875.46 → 1879.58] I wonder
[1879.58 → 1880.84] what we would learn
[1880.84 → 1881.80] about ourselves
[1881.80 → 1882.72] right
[1882.72 → 1883.52] if we were honest
[1883.52 → 1884.62] with what we think
[1884.62 → 1886.04] would make us happy
[1886.04 → 1888.06] do you know
[1888.06 → 1888.72] what you would put
[1888.72 → 1889.30] in that letter
[1889.30 → 1891.38] dear god
[1891.38 → 1893.24] this is what
[1893.24 → 1895.06] will make me happy
[1895.06 → 1897.78] well this morning
[1897.78 → 1899.08] we're going to consider
[1899.08 → 1899.98] the life of Moses
[1899.98 → 1901.50] and it
[1901.50 → 1903.20] as Hebrews 11
[1903.20 → 1904.64] talks about his life
[1904.64 → 1906.08] it is about
[1906.08 → 1907.72] what Moses thought
[1907.72 → 1909.50] would make him happy
[1909.50 → 1910.96] and so
[1910.96 → 1912.86] who is Moses
[1912.86 → 1913.60] right
[1913.60 → 1914.58] well if there was
[1914.58 → 1915.72] a Mount Rushmore
[1915.72 → 1917.06] for Old Testament
[1917.06 → 1917.70] characters
[1917.70 → 1918.76] Moses's face
[1918.76 → 1919.84] would absolutely
[1919.84 → 1921.06] be there
[1921.06 → 1921.76] right
[1921.76 → 1923.32] and so Moses's life
[1923.32 → 1924.26] it extends
[1924.26 → 1926.08] across a great deal
[1926.08 → 1927.72] of the biblical story
[1927.72 → 1929.22] and his voice
[1929.22 → 1929.72] is heard
[1929.72 → 1930.44] in everything
[1930.44 → 1932.12] that comes after it
[1932.12 → 1933.18] even up into
[1933.18 → 1934.26] the New Testament
[1934.26 → 1936.62] and um
[1936.62 → 1937.38] if the
[1937.38 → 1938.24] if this morning
[1938.24 → 1939.64] you only know Moses
[1939.64 → 1940.70] from the movies
[1940.70 → 1942.62] I would really
[1942.62 → 1943.40] encourage you
[1943.40 → 1944.70] to read the book
[1944.70 → 1945.22] of exodus
[1945.22 → 1945.82] in the bible
[1945.82 → 1946.64] it's the second book
[1946.64 → 1948.92] and the entire book
[1948.92 → 1949.42] of exodus
[1949.42 → 1950.42] focuses on
[1950.42 → 1951.62] the great story
[1951.62 → 1952.86] of Moses
[1952.86 → 1953.70] it'd be a great thing
[1953.70 → 1954.46] to do over this
[1954.46 → 1955.12] holiday season
[1955.12 → 1957.66] but the bare outline
[1957.66 → 1958.76] of Moses's life
[1958.76 → 1959.92] goes something like this
[1959.92 → 1961.16] Moses's mother
[1961.16 → 1962.60] when he was a newborn
[1962.60 → 1963.64] puts him in a basket
[1963.64 → 1965.38] to save his life
[1965.38 → 1967.54] then he is found
[1967.54 → 1968.56] by pharaoh's daughter
[1968.56 → 1969.12] and taken
[1969.12 → 1970.22] to be raised
[1970.22 → 1971.20] in pharaoh's household
[1971.20 → 1972.74] and that is the first
[1972.74 → 1974.00] 40 years of his life
[1974.00 → 1976.44] but then he is exiled
[1976.44 → 1977.56] he runs away
[1977.56 → 1978.24] to median
[1978.24 → 1980.26] where for 40 years
[1980.26 → 1981.46] he was a shepherd
[1981.46 → 1983.50] and while he was out
[1983.50 → 1984.74] shepherding his sheep
[1984.74 → 1985.16] god
[1985.16 → 1986.44] spoke to him
[1986.44 → 1987.46] spoke to him
[1987.46 → 1988.60] through a burning bush
[1988.60 → 1990.58] and god told Moses
[1990.58 → 1991.20] his name
[1991.20 → 1991.96] and that there is
[1991.96 → 1992.90] only one god
[1992.90 → 1993.50] not many
[1993.50 → 1995.48] and then god
[1995.48 → 1996.30] sent Moses
[1996.30 → 1997.66] back to Egypt
[1997.66 → 1998.60] to deliver
[1998.60 → 1999.68] the Hebrews
[1999.68 → 2000.54] from their slavery
[2000.54 → 2002.42] and after leading
[2002.42 → 2003.40] them out of Egypt
[2003.40 → 2004.24] Moses received
[2004.24 → 2005.14] the law from god
[2005.14 → 2005.96] on mount Sinai
[2005.96 → 2007.10] with instructions
[2007.10 → 2008.28] about the sacrifices
[2008.28 → 2009.18] in the temple
[2009.18 → 2010.96] that would give order
[2010.96 → 2011.68] to the worship
[2011.68 → 2012.24] and the life
[2012.24 → 2012.98] of god's people
[2012.98 → 2015.10] and then Moses
[2015.10 → 2016.40] led Israel
[2016.40 → 2017.32] through the wilderness
[2017.32 → 2018.68] for decades
[2018.68 → 2020.28] to the very border
[2020.28 → 2022.12] of the promised land
[2022.12 → 2024.14] and so Moses
[2024.14 → 2026.04] he had a very full life
[2026.04 → 2027.24] he was a leader
[2027.24 → 2028.36] and a deliverer
[2028.36 → 2030.18] he was a lawgiver
[2030.18 → 2031.36] and a prophet
[2031.36 → 2034.38] and he was so influential
[2034.38 → 2035.36] in fact
[2035.36 → 2036.78] that one of the deepest
[2036.78 → 2038.06] struggles that our lord
[2038.06 → 2038.94] Jesus faced
[2038.94 → 2039.72] in his ministry
[2039.72 → 2041.78] was talking to
[2041.78 → 2042.96] devout Jews
[2042.96 → 2044.26] who were thinking
[2044.26 → 2045.50] that Jesus was asking
[2045.50 → 2047.02] them to be unfaithful
[2047.02 → 2048.26] to the teachings
[2048.26 → 2049.28] and traditions
[2049.28 → 2050.00] of Moses
[2050.00 → 2051.78] right
[2051.78 → 2052.88] but Jesus wanted
[2052.88 → 2054.16] the people to know
[2054.16 → 2054.86] that everything
[2054.86 → 2055.80] that Moses said
[2055.80 → 2056.40] and did
[2056.40 → 2057.58] actually pointed
[2057.58 → 2059.12] to him
[2059.12 → 2059.92] and was fulfilled
[2059.92 → 2060.70] by him
[2060.70 → 2061.94] as the promised messiah
[2061.94 → 2063.08] and it was a constant
[2063.08 → 2063.52] struggle
[2063.52 → 2066.78] so what
[2066.78 → 2067.94] did Moses
[2067.94 → 2069.30] think
[2069.30 → 2070.72] would make him
[2070.72 → 2071.14] happy
[2071.14 → 2072.56] and how did
[2072.56 → 2073.30] his faith
[2073.30 → 2074.50] please god
[2074.50 → 2075.46] how was he
[2075.46 → 2076.48] commended for his faith
[2076.48 → 2078.14] well we're going to look
[2078.14 → 2078.78] through our passage
[2078.78 → 2079.30] this morning
[2079.30 → 2080.88] and we begin
[2080.88 → 2082.02] in verse 24
[2082.02 → 2084.24] so verse 24
[2084.24 → 2084.70] says
[2084.70 → 2085.52] by faith
[2085.52 → 2086.62] Moses
[2086.62 → 2088.14] when he had grown up
[2088.14 → 2090.12] refused to be known
[2090.12 → 2091.14] as the son
[2091.14 → 2092.70] of pharaoh's
[2092.70 → 2093.30] daughter
[2093.30 → 2095.48] so if you
[2095.48 → 2096.36] if you remember
[2096.36 → 2096.90] pharaoh
[2096.90 → 2098.12] the tyrant of Egypt
[2098.12 → 2100.38] had decided to kill
[2100.38 → 2101.44] all the male
[2101.44 → 2103.06] babies of Israel
[2103.06 → 2104.58] for his own
[2104.58 → 2105.02] protection
[2105.02 → 2105.56] right
[2105.56 → 2106.12] he didn't want
[2106.12 → 2106.74] the foreigners
[2106.74 → 2108.10] to outnumber
[2108.10 → 2108.90] his own people
[2108.90 → 2111.50] and baby Moses
[2111.50 → 2112.62] was hidden
[2112.62 → 2113.40] in a basket
[2113.40 → 2115.42] and he was put
[2115.42 → 2116.02] in this
[2116.02 → 2117.14] this little ark
[2117.14 → 2118.92] and sent off
[2118.92 → 2119.54] into the river
[2119.54 → 2121.22] and he was found
[2121.22 → 2121.86] and raised
[2121.86 → 2123.00] by the daughter
[2123.00 → 2123.50] of pharaoh
[2123.50 → 2125.18] and it's very important
[2125.18 → 2126.12] for us to see
[2126.12 → 2127.32] that the Egyptians
[2127.32 → 2128.24] were a mighty
[2128.24 → 2129.08] and developed
[2129.08 → 2129.64] civilization
[2129.64 → 2131.20] and they thought
[2131.20 → 2132.22] that the Hebrews
[2132.22 → 2133.30] were a crude
[2133.30 → 2133.86] dirty
[2133.86 → 2135.00] and uncultured
[2135.00 → 2135.44] people
[2135.44 → 2136.58] right
[2136.58 → 2137.22] and so Egypt
[2137.22 → 2138.36] was wealthy
[2138.36 → 2139.40] in its power
[2139.40 → 2141.26] its learning
[2141.26 → 2142.34] its technology
[2142.34 → 2143.20] its arts
[2143.20 → 2143.98] its literature
[2143.98 → 2145.50] and Moses
[2145.50 → 2146.74] had all of
[2146.74 → 2147.72] these advantages
[2147.72 → 2149.88] raised and educated
[2149.88 → 2150.78] as a prince
[2150.78 → 2151.30] of Egypt
[2151.30 → 2153.16] and in that
[2153.16 → 2154.12] 18th century
[2154.12 → 2154.64] dynasty
[2154.64 → 2155.80] of the new kingdom
[2155.80 → 2156.88] if you had
[2156.88 → 2157.46] the title
[2157.46 → 2159.36] son of pharaoh's
[2159.36 → 2159.70] daughter
[2159.70 → 2161.08] it meant
[2161.08 → 2161.66] that you could
[2161.66 → 2162.48] have anything
[2162.48 → 2162.68] anything
[2162.68 → 2163.66] your heart
[2163.66 → 2164.42] can dream
[2164.42 → 2164.72] up
[2164.72 → 2166.08] anything
[2166.08 → 2166.72] that Moses
[2166.72 → 2167.22] thought
[2167.22 → 2168.06] would make
[2168.06 → 2168.74] him happy
[2168.74 → 2170.50] was at
[2170.50 → 2171.06] his
[2171.06 → 2171.76] fingertips
[2171.76 → 2173.94] and so
[2173.94 → 2174.74] it seems
[2174.74 → 2175.16] terribly
[2175.16 → 2175.98] ungrateful
[2175.98 → 2177.58] confusing
[2177.58 → 2178.26] perhaps
[2178.26 → 2179.32] that he would
[2179.32 → 2180.12] refuse
[2180.12 → 2181.54] all the
[2181.54 → 2182.16] opportunities
[2182.16 → 2183.08] given to him
[2183.08 → 2184.52] and to refuse
[2184.52 → 2185.20] his adoptive
[2185.20 → 2185.54] mother
[2185.54 → 2187.08] who gave
[2187.08 → 2187.86] them to him
[2187.86 → 2189.74] so why
[2189.74 → 2190.06] did he
[2190.06 → 2190.56] do it
[2190.56 → 2191.72] why did
[2191.72 → 2192.94] he refuse
[2192.94 → 2193.98] to be
[2193.98 → 2194.48] known
[2194.48 → 2195.28] as the
[2195.28 → 2195.60] son of
[2195.60 → 2195.92] pharaoh's
[2195.92 → 2196.22] daughter
[2196.22 → 2197.10] well
[2197.10 → 2198.72] verse 25
[2198.72 → 2199.48] it continues
[2199.48 → 2200.78] he chose
[2200.78 → 2201.18] to be
[2201.18 → 2201.94] mistreated
[2201.94 → 2203.14] along with
[2203.14 → 2203.78] the people
[2203.78 → 2204.46] of god
[2204.46 → 2205.44] rather
[2205.44 → 2206.42] than to
[2206.42 → 2207.04] enjoy the
[2207.04 → 2207.46] fleeting
[2207.46 → 2207.98] pleasures
[2207.98 → 2209.08] of sin
[2209.08 → 2211.68] so Moses
[2211.68 → 2212.34] it says
[2212.34 → 2213.42] had a
[2213.42 → 2213.88] choice
[2213.88 → 2215.70] he knew
[2215.70 → 2216.04] what he
[2216.04 → 2216.44] was giving
[2216.44 → 2216.80] up
[2216.80 → 2218.36] he saw
[2218.36 → 2218.98] that
[2218.98 → 2219.32] Egypt
[2219.32 → 2219.90] offered
[2219.90 → 2220.24] him
[2220.24 → 2221.00] an easy
[2221.00 → 2222.12] and pleasant
[2222.12 → 2222.60] life
[2222.60 → 2223.60] the life
[2223.60 → 2223.88] Moses
[2223.88 → 2224.56] could have
[2224.56 → 2224.88] as
[2224.88 → 2226.06] was one
[2226.06 → 2226.72] that his
[2226.72 → 2227.38] Egyptian
[2227.38 → 2227.98] culture
[2227.98 → 2228.68] would
[2228.68 → 2230.14] very much
[2230.14 → 2230.70] agree
[2230.70 → 2231.32] and say
[2231.32 → 2231.82] would
[2231.82 → 2232.54] promise
[2232.54 → 2233.22] happiness
[2233.22 → 2234.40] if he took
[2234.40 → 2234.78] advantage
[2234.78 → 2235.16] of all
[2235.16 → 2235.64] that he
[2235.64 → 2236.00] had
[2236.00 → 2237.00] right
[2237.00 → 2237.36] he could
[2237.36 → 2237.62] have
[2237.62 → 2237.96] fine
[2237.96 → 2238.50] clothes
[2238.50 → 2240.04] he could
[2240.04 → 2240.32] have a
[2240.32 → 2240.54] nice
[2240.54 → 2240.94] apartment
[2240.94 → 2241.28] in the
[2241.28 → 2241.66] palace
[2241.66 → 2242.14] or maybe
[2242.14 → 2242.64] a villa
[2242.64 → 2243.14] by the
[2243.14 → 2243.42] Nile
[2243.42 → 2245.18] he could
[2245.18 → 2245.46] have a
[2245.46 → 2246.02] good job
[2246.02 → 2246.80] he could
[2246.80 → 2246.92] have
[2246.92 → 2247.50] cultured
[2247.50 → 2247.96] friends
[2247.96 → 2249.58] and slaves
[2249.58 → 2250.34] waiting on
[2250.34 → 2250.80] his every
[2250.80 → 2251.12] need
[2251.12 → 2251.60] he could
[2251.60 → 2252.28] have status
[2252.28 → 2252.60] in a
[2252.60 → 2252.84] great
[2252.84 → 2253.42] civilization
[2253.42 → 2255.14] all he
[2255.14 → 2255.62] had to
[2255.62 → 2256.16] do
[2256.16 → 2257.98] was rejected
[2257.98 → 2258.88] the god
[2258.88 → 2259.30] of his
[2259.30 → 2259.72] people
[2259.72 → 2261.00] and to
[2261.00 → 2261.88] not identify
[2261.88 → 2262.50] with them
[2262.50 → 2264.48] right
[2264.48 → 2264.92] but Moses
[2264.92 → 2265.82] thought about
[2265.82 → 2266.52] what would
[2266.52 → 2266.90] make him
[2266.90 → 2267.26] happy
[2267.26 → 2268.42] he thought
[2268.42 → 2268.88] about it
[2268.88 → 2269.58] he waited
[2269.58 → 2269.98] up
[2269.98 → 2270.96] and he
[2270.96 → 2271.48] concluded
[2271.48 → 2272.18] that those
[2272.18 → 2272.58] easy
[2272.58 → 2273.20] pleasures
[2273.20 → 2274.68] were not
[2274.68 → 2276.00] the actual
[2276.00 → 2276.56] way
[2276.56 → 2277.06] to
[2277.06 → 2277.64] happiness
[2277.64 → 2279.50] you know
[2279.50 → 2279.92] and I think
[2279.92 → 2280.30] that most
[2280.30 → 2280.56] of the
[2280.56 → 2280.84] letters
[2280.84 → 2281.36] written to
[2281.36 → 2281.74] Santa
[2281.74 → 2283.02] are filled
[2283.02 → 2283.60] with the
[2283.60 → 2284.30] kinds of
[2284.30 → 2285.02] things that
[2285.02 → 2285.30] Moses
[2285.30 → 2285.92] walked away
[2285.92 → 2286.22] from
[2286.22 → 2287.16] not even
[2287.16 → 2287.68] necessarily
[2287.68 → 2288.66] sinful
[2288.66 → 2290.28] but fleeting
[2290.28 → 2291.40] pleasures that
[2291.40 → 2292.06] don't really
[2292.06 → 2292.96] bring true
[2292.96 → 2293.60] happiness
[2293.60 → 2295.70] and so we
[2295.70 → 2296.16] need to think
[2296.16 → 2296.98] about Moses
[2296.98 → 2297.78] example
[2297.78 → 2299.04] and what it
[2299.04 → 2299.44] means for
[2299.44 → 2299.88] us
[2299.88 → 2302.04] and it
[2302.04 → 2302.66] goes on
[2302.66 → 2302.98] in verse
[2302.98 → 2303.72] 26
[2303.72 → 2306.52] he regarded
[2306.52 → 2307.26] disgrace
[2307.26 → 2308.02] for the
[2308.02 → 2308.82] sake of
[2308.82 → 2309.22] Christ
[2309.22 → 2309.88] as of
[2309.88 → 2310.34] greater
[2310.34 → 2311.30] value
[2311.30 → 2312.44] than the
[2312.44 → 2312.84] treasures
[2312.84 → 2313.54] of Egypt
[2313.54 → 2314.54] because he
[2314.54 → 2314.94] was looking
[2314.94 → 2315.50] ahead
[2315.50 → 2316.56] to his
[2316.56 → 2317.04] reward
[2317.04 → 2319.34] and this
[2319.34 → 2319.72] is
[2319.72 → 2320.76] interesting
[2320.76 → 2321.56] if not
[2321.56 → 2322.32] even maybe
[2322.32 → 2322.76] a little bit
[2322.76 → 2323.28] confusing
[2323.28 → 2325.12] because
[2325.12 → 2325.82] Moses
[2325.82 → 2327.30] did not
[2327.30 → 2328.22] know Christ
[2328.22 → 2329.26] did he
[2329.26 → 2332.08] he didn't
[2332.08 → 2332.62] know Christ
[2332.62 → 2333.44] he knew
[2333.44 → 2334.14] Yahweh
[2334.14 → 2334.76] he knew
[2334.76 → 2335.66] the god
[2335.66 → 2336.22] of Abraham
[2336.22 → 2336.78] Isaac
[2336.78 → 2337.52] and Jacob
[2337.52 → 2337.92] the god
[2337.92 → 2338.24] of his
[2338.24 → 2338.70] fathers
[2338.70 → 2340.28] and yet
[2340.28 → 2340.80] when he
[2340.80 → 2341.66] chose to
[2341.66 → 2342.76] be disgraced
[2342.76 → 2344.10] and disliked
[2344.10 → 2344.78] and demeaned
[2344.78 → 2345.66] and disrespected
[2345.66 → 2347.22] for being a
[2347.22 → 2347.82] Hebrew
[2347.82 → 2348.94] rather than
[2348.94 → 2349.70] an Egyptian
[2349.70 → 2350.82] he was choosing
[2350.82 → 2351.70] to be associated
[2351.70 → 2352.54] with Christ
[2352.54 → 2353.94] the same
[2353.94 → 2354.76] son of god
[2354.76 → 2355.54] that we today
[2355.54 → 2357.00] are associated
[2357.00 → 2357.72] with in worship
[2357.72 → 2360.08] and so
[2360.08 → 2360.44] Jesus
[2360.44 → 2361.00] put it
[2361.00 → 2361.48] this way
[2361.48 → 2362.16] in john
[2362.16 → 2362.78] chapter 5
[2362.78 → 2363.08] to the
[2363.08 → 2363.76] people who
[2363.76 → 2365.14] hated him
[2365.14 → 2366.64] and felt
[2366.64 → 2367.28] threatened by
[2367.28 → 2367.56] him
[2367.56 → 2368.38] Jesus said
[2368.38 → 2368.68] this
[2368.68 → 2369.48] if you
[2369.48 → 2370.12] believed
[2370.12 → 2370.68] Moses
[2370.68 → 2371.42] you would
[2371.42 → 2372.04] believe me
[2372.04 → 2373.64] for he
[2373.64 → 2374.82] wrote
[2374.82 → 2375.72] about me
[2375.72 → 2377.42] but
[2377.42 → 2377.94] since you
[2377.94 → 2378.30] do not
[2378.30 → 2378.66] believe
[2378.66 → 2379.02] what he
[2379.02 → 2379.34] wrote
[2379.34 → 2380.38] how are
[2380.38 → 2380.62] you going
[2380.62 → 2381.14] to believe
[2381.14 → 2381.70] what i
[2381.70 → 2382.20] say
[2382.20 → 2383.64] can you
[2383.64 → 2383.94] imagine
[2383.94 → 2384.28] Jesus
[2384.28 → 2384.76] telling
[2384.76 → 2385.54] these
[2385.54 → 2386.28] pious
[2386.28 → 2387.66] Hebrews
[2387.66 → 2388.62] that they
[2388.62 → 2389.10] do not
[2389.10 → 2389.50] believe
[2389.50 → 2390.02] what Moses
[2390.02 → 2390.38] wrote
[2390.38 → 2392.34] that's an
[2392.34 → 2392.66] insult
[2392.66 → 2393.74] but it's
[2393.74 → 2394.08] true
[2394.08 → 2395.38] because they
[2395.38 → 2395.60] wouldn't
[2395.60 → 2396.00] believe
[2396.00 → 2396.82] Christ
[2396.82 → 2399.08] and so
[2399.08 → 2399.50] Jesus
[2399.50 → 2400.14] claims
[2400.14 → 2400.92] that Moses
[2400.92 → 2401.44] wrote about
[2401.44 → 2401.70] him
[2401.70 → 2402.34] Moses
[2402.34 → 2402.82] did not
[2402.82 → 2403.50] see Christ
[2403.50 → 2404.28] when he
[2404.28 → 2404.68] made that
[2404.68 → 2405.06] decision
[2405.06 → 2405.86] to choose
[2405.86 → 2406.52] to identify
[2406.52 → 2407.92] with Yahweh
[2407.92 → 2408.76] and his
[2408.76 → 2409.22] people
[2409.22 → 2411.20] but he
[2411.20 → 2412.14] was choosing
[2412.14 → 2413.02] to follow
[2413.02 → 2413.52] Christ
[2413.52 → 2415.00] and this
[2415.00 → 2416.08] this choice
[2416.08 → 2416.64] was a
[2416.64 → 2417.14] question
[2417.14 → 2418.28] of which
[2418.28 → 2418.88] was worth
[2418.88 → 2419.28] more
[2419.28 → 2420.40] right a
[2420.40 → 2420.76] question
[2420.76 → 2421.82] of where
[2421.82 → 2422.54] lies
[2422.54 → 2423.46] the best
[2423.46 → 2424.06] treasure
[2424.06 → 2425.92] so look
[2425.92 → 2426.42] again at
[2426.42 → 2427.22] verse 26
[2427.22 → 2428.88] it says
[2428.88 → 2429.48] again he
[2429.48 → 2429.94] regarded
[2429.94 → 2430.66] disgrace
[2430.66 → 2431.28] for the
[2431.28 → 2431.64] sake of
[2431.64 → 2431.92] Christ
[2431.92 → 2432.40] as of
[2432.40 → 2432.76] greater
[2432.76 → 2433.44] value
[2433.44 → 2434.28] than the
[2434.28 → 2434.62] treasures
[2434.62 → 2435.24] of Egypt
[2435.24 → 2436.20] because he
[2436.20 → 2436.58] was looking
[2436.58 → 2437.10] ahead to
[2437.10 → 2437.50] his
[2437.50 → 2438.50] reward
[2438.50 → 2440.38] now
[2440.38 → 2441.20] this next
[2441.20 → 2441.86] point
[2441.86 → 2443.54] may be
[2443.54 → 2443.88] shocking
[2443.88 → 2444.44] to you
[2444.44 → 2445.56] but it's
[2445.56 → 2445.90] true
[2445.90 → 2446.24] and i
[2446.24 → 2446.68] stand by
[2446.68 → 2447.04] it
[2447.04 → 2448.76] is this
[2448.76 → 2449.62] that Christian
[2449.62 → 2450.36] spirituality
[2450.36 → 2451.72] tells us
[2451.72 → 2452.16] and that the
[2452.16 → 2453.26] bible tells
[2453.26 → 2453.68] us
[2453.68 → 2454.86] that god
[2454.86 → 2455.38] wants us
[2455.38 → 2455.62] to be
[2455.62 → 2455.94] happy
[2455.94 → 2459.12] do you
[2459.12 → 2459.36] believe
[2459.36 → 2459.66] that
[2459.66 → 2460.88] is that
[2460.88 → 2461.28] shocking
[2461.28 → 2461.86] to you
[2461.86 → 2463.86] see
[2463.86 → 2464.26] Moses
[2464.26 → 2464.92] wasn't
[2464.92 → 2465.32] choosing
[2465.32 → 2465.90] between
[2465.90 → 2466.72] misery
[2466.72 → 2467.66] and
[2467.66 → 2468.14] happiness
[2468.14 → 2468.36] happiness
[2468.36 → 2469.14] he was
[2469.14 → 2469.62] deciding
[2469.62 → 2470.86] what would
[2470.86 → 2471.22] make him
[2471.22 → 2471.62] happy
[2471.62 → 2472.72] the
[2472.72 → 2473.14] fleeting
[2473.14 → 2473.62] pleasures
[2473.62 → 2474.16] of sin
[2474.16 → 2474.64] would that
[2474.64 → 2475.26] lead to
[2475.26 → 2475.46] his
[2475.46 → 2475.82] happiness
[2475.82 → 2476.84] or would
[2476.84 → 2477.56] following
[2477.56 → 2478.32] Christ
[2478.32 → 2479.04] lead to
[2479.04 → 2479.28] his
[2479.28 → 2479.66] happiness
[2479.66 → 2481.36] and so
[2481.36 → 2481.58] where
[2481.58 → 2482.40] Christianity
[2482.40 → 2483.12] disagrees
[2483.12 → 2483.56] with the
[2483.56 → 2484.04] world
[2484.04 → 2485.24] is not
[2485.24 → 2485.56] whether
[2485.56 → 2486.26] or not
[2486.26 → 2487.24] we should
[2487.24 → 2487.88] seek
[2487.88 → 2488.38] happiness
[2488.38 → 2489.30] but where
[2489.30 → 2490.22] human
[2490.22 → 2490.62] happiness
[2490.62 → 2490.92] is to
[2490.92 → 2491.36] be found
[2491.36 → 2493.06] where
[2493.06 → 2493.80] are we
[2493.80 → 2494.54] to find
[2494.54 → 2494.98] true
[2494.98 → 2495.60] happiness
[2495.60 → 2497.46] well
[2497.46 → 2497.68] I'm
[2497.68 → 2497.78] going
[2497.78 → 2497.86] to
[2497.86 → 2498.06] have
[2498.06 → 2498.22] to
[2498.22 → 2498.58] reach
[2498.58 → 2499.12] to
[2499.12 → 2500.06] as
[2500.06 → 2500.28] much
[2500.28 → 2500.44] as
[2500.44 → 2500.70] I
[2500.70 → 2501.34] love
[2501.34 → 2501.54] our
[2501.54 → 2501.86] three
[2501.86 → 2502.18] forms
[2502.18 → 2502.32] of
[2502.32 → 2502.62] unity
[2502.62 → 2502.98] I'm
[2502.98 → 2503.06] going
[2503.06 → 2503.22] to
[2503.22 → 2503.70] look
[2503.70 → 2503.88] to

[2504.40 → 2505.52] Presbyterian
[2505.52 → 2505.90] background
[2505.90 → 2507.12] and we're
[2507.12 → 2507.26] going to
[2507.26 → 2507.56] look at
[2507.56 → 2507.86] the

[2508.78 → 2509.42] Catechism
[2509.42 → 2510.26] question
[2510.26 → 2510.66] and answer
[2510.66 → 2510.98] one
[2510.98 → 2511.80] just about
[2511.80 → 2512.26] as famous
[2512.26 → 2512.74] as the
[2512.74 → 2513.20] Heidelberg
[2513.20 → 2514.30] question
[2514.30 → 2514.66] and answer
[2514.66 → 2514.94] one
[2514.94 → 2515.74] this is
[2515.74 → 2515.96] what it
[2515.96 → 2516.24] says
[2516.24 → 2516.62] what is
[2516.62 → 2517.10] the chief
[2517.10 → 2517.46] end
[2517.46 → 2517.94] of man
[2517.94 → 2518.84] and please
[2518.84 → 2519.26] say the
[2519.26 → 2519.48] answer
[2519.48 → 2519.90] with me
[2519.90 → 2521.26] man's
[2521.26 → 2521.58] chief
[2521.58 → 2522.04] end
[2522.04 → 2522.72] is to
[2522.72 → 2523.26] glorify
[2523.26 → 2523.82] God
[2523.82 → 2524.70] and to
[2524.70 → 2525.28] enjoy
[2525.28 → 2525.88] him
[2525.88 → 2526.44] forever
[2526.44 → 2529.02] to
[2529.02 → 2529.82] enjoy
[2529.82 → 2531.16] him
[2531.16 → 2532.06] forever
[2532.06 → 2533.94] it's
[2533.94 → 2534.12] about
[2534.12 → 2534.50] joy
[2534.50 → 2534.88] it's
[2534.88 → 2535.02] about
[2535.02 → 2535.44] happiness
[2535.44 → 2536.20] blessedness
[2536.20 → 2537.68] the
[2537.68 → 2538.10] purpose
[2538.10 → 2538.38] of
[2538.38 → 2538.94] life
[2538.94 → 2540.32] is
[2540.32 → 2540.54] to
[2540.54 → 2540.96] enjoy
[2540.96 → 2541.40] God
[2541.40 → 2542.80] to
[2542.80 → 2543.12] be
[2543.12 → 2543.62] happy
[2543.62 → 2543.90] in
[2543.90 → 2544.12] God
[2544.12 → 2544.30] to
[2544.30 → 2544.58] find
[2544.58 → 2545.18] happiness
[2545.18 → 2546.50] in
[2546.50 → 2546.64] a
[2546.64 → 2547.32] relationship
[2547.32 → 2547.92] with
[2547.92 → 2548.52] God
[2548.52 → 2548.88] our
[2548.88 → 2549.38] creator
[2549.38 → 2550.88] right
[2550.88 → 2551.16] and so
[2551.16 → 2551.56] we are
[2551.56 → 2551.76] made
[2551.76 → 2552.04] we are
[2552.04 → 2552.46] absolutely
[2552.46 → 2553.06] made
[2553.06 → 2553.72] for
[2553.72 → 2554.30] union
[2554.30 → 2554.74] with
[2554.74 → 2555.06] him
[2555.06 → 2555.60] for
[2555.60 → 2556.16] his
[2556.16 → 2556.52] love
[2556.52 → 2557.86] and so
[2557.86 → 2558.08] don't
[2558.08 → 2558.24] be
[2558.24 → 2558.68] uncomfortable
[2558.68 → 2559.08] with
[2559.08 → 2559.24] that
[2559.24 → 2559.78] language
[2559.78 → 2560.38] of
[2560.38 → 2560.94] reward
[2560.94 → 2561.64] right
[2561.64 → 2561.82] and
[2561.82 → 2562.44] seeking
[2562.44 → 2562.82] what
[2562.82 → 2563.06] is
[2563.06 → 2563.50] truly
[2563.50 → 2564.48] valuable
[2564.48 → 2565.96] and
[2565.96 → 2566.32] seeking
[2566.32 → 2566.92] what
[2566.92 → 2567.10] will
[2567.10 → 2567.40] truly
[2567.40 → 2567.66] make
[2567.66 → 2567.80] us
[2567.80 → 2568.16] happy
[2568.16 → 2570.40] and
[2570.40 → 2570.92] here
[2570.92 → 2571.24] again
[2571.24 → 2571.70] we see
[2571.70 → 2571.88] the
[2571.88 → 2572.32] pattern
[2572.32 → 2572.52] that
[2572.52 → 2572.74] we've
[2572.74 → 2572.96] seen
[2572.96 → 2573.30] throughout
[2573.30 → 2573.64] Hebrews
[2573.64 → 2573.96] 11
[2573.96 → 2574.18] this
[2574.18 → 2574.62] pattern
[2574.62 → 2575.14] of
[2575.14 → 2575.54] faith
[2575.54 → 2576.28] so
[2576.28 → 2576.60] as
[2576.60 → 2576.72] it
[2576.72 → 2576.94] was
[2576.94 → 2577.14] with
[2577.14 → 2577.70] Enoch
[2577.70 → 2578.18] and
[2578.18 → 2578.60] Abraham
[2578.60 → 2579.10] and
[2579.10 → 2579.50] Noah
[2579.50 → 2580.50] or
[2580.50 → 2580.84] Noah
[2580.84 → 2581.02] and
[2581.02 → 2581.34] Abraham
[2581.34 → 2581.62] if
[2581.62 → 2581.72] we're
[2581.72 → 2581.90] going
[2581.90 → 2582.04] in
[2582.04 → 2582.32] order
[2582.32 → 2583.96] Moses
[2583.96 → 2584.76] also
[2584.76 → 2585.32] was
[2585.32 → 2585.66] looking
[2585.66 → 2586.20] ahead
[2586.20 → 2586.76] to
[2586.76 → 2587.04] his
[2587.04 → 2587.50] reward
[2587.50 → 2588.44] right
[2588.44 → 2588.76] Moses
[2588.76 → 2589.30] saw
[2589.30 → 2589.88] with
[2589.88 → 2590.08] his
[2590.08 → 2590.44] eyes
[2590.44 → 2590.60] he
[2590.60 → 2590.74] could
[2590.74 → 2591.02] actually
[2591.02 → 2591.38] see
[2591.38 → 2591.88] all
[2591.88 → 2592.36] the
[2592.36 → 2592.88] treasures
[2592.88 → 2593.36] of
[2593.36 → 2593.78] Egypt
[2593.78 → 2594.22] offered
[2594.22 → 2594.46] to
[2594.46 → 2594.74] him
[2594.74 → 2595.68] he
[2595.68 → 2595.94] could
[2595.94 → 2596.30] not
[2596.30 → 2596.78] see
[2596.78 → 2597.48] the
[2597.48 → 2598.06] reward
[2598.06 → 2598.44] of
[2598.44 → 2598.88] choosing
[2598.88 → 2599.62] Jesus
[2599.62 → 2600.80] but
[2600.80 → 2601.04] by
[2601.04 → 2601.72] faith
[2601.72 → 2602.00] by
[2602.00 → 2602.16] the
[2602.16 → 2602.44] eyes
[2602.44 → 2602.60] of
[2602.60 → 2602.82] faith
[2602.82 → 2603.02] he
[2603.02 → 2603.60] chose
[2603.60 → 2604.02] the
[2604.02 → 2604.32] way
[2604.32 → 2604.56] of
[2604.56 → 2605.06] Christ
[2605.06 → 2606.14] and
[2606.14 → 2606.32] he
[2606.32 → 2606.56] looked
[2606.56 → 2607.02] ahead
[2607.02 → 2607.26] to
[2607.26 → 2607.48] his
[2607.48 → 2607.82] reward
[2607.82 → 2608.02] he
[2608.02 → 2608.70] refused
[2608.70 → 2609.14] to
[2609.14 → 2609.28] be
[2609.28 → 2609.80] identified
[2609.80 → 2610.58] with
[2610.58 → 2610.74] the
[2610.74 → 2611.10] son
[2611.10 → 2611.46] of
[2611.46 → 2611.80] Pharaoh's
[2611.80 → 2612.12] daughter
[2612.12 → 2613.30] and
[2613.30 → 2613.88] instead
[2613.88 → 2615.04] identified
[2615.04 → 2615.34] with
[2615.34 → 2615.80] Christ
[2615.80 → 2617.00] you know
[2617.00 → 2617.60] and so
[2617.60 → 2617.88] much
[2617.88 → 2618.40] of our
[2618.40 → 2618.86] our
[2618.86 → 2619.26] culture
[2619.26 → 2619.96] today
[2619.96 → 2620.68] especially
[2620.68 → 2620.96] in the
[2620.96 → 2621.26] younger
[2621.26 → 2622.14] generations
[2622.14 → 2623.62] are talking
[2623.62 → 2623.88] about
[2623.88 → 2624.24] finding
[2624.24 → 2624.62] one's
[2624.62 → 2625.08] identity
[2625.08 → 2626.10] or
[2626.10 → 2626.68] declaring
[2626.68 → 2627.40] one's
[2627.40 → 2627.94] identity
[2627.94 → 2628.74] and
[2628.74 → 2629.08] Moses
[2629.08 → 2630.14] declared
[2630.14 → 2630.44] his
[2630.44 → 2630.92] identity
[2630.92 → 2632.16] as
[2632.16 → 2633.58] a
[2633.58 → 2634.02] person
[2634.02 → 2634.56] of
[2634.56 → 2635.50] God's
[2635.50 → 2635.82] people
[2635.82 → 2636.52] as
[2636.52 → 2637.40] identifying
[2637.40 → 2638.14] himself
[2638.14 → 2638.56] with
[2638.56 → 2639.10] Christ
[2639.10 → 2641.88] and
[2641.88 → 2642.06] so
[2642.06 → 2642.28] as
[2642.28 → 2642.66] God
[2642.66 → 2643.10] you know
[2643.10 → 2643.56] sent
[2643.56 → 2644.02] Moses
[2644.02 → 2644.34] then
[2644.34 → 2644.82] to be
[2644.82 → 2645.08] a
[2645.08 → 2645.34] leader
[2645.34 → 2645.64] and
[2645.64 → 2646.40] deliverer
[2646.40 → 2647.16] you know
[2647.16 → 2647.36] I'm
[2647.36 → 2647.62] sure
[2647.62 → 2647.82] that
[2647.82 → 2647.96] there
[2647.96 → 2648.06] were
[2648.06 → 2648.32] many
[2648.32 → 2648.78] joys
[2648.78 → 2648.98] and
[2648.98 → 2649.32] pleasures
[2649.32 → 2649.80] along
[2649.80 → 2649.98] the
[2649.98 → 2650.22] way
[2650.22 → 2651.34] but
[2651.34 → 2651.64] Moses
[2651.64 → 2651.94] was
[2651.94 → 2652.32] choosing
[2652.32 → 2653.12] to
[2653.12 → 2653.44] lead
[2653.44 → 2653.64] a
[2653.64 → 2654.12] grumbling
[2654.12 → 2654.66] people
[2654.66 → 2655.58] through
[2655.58 → 2655.92] many
[2655.92 → 2656.34] harsh
[2656.34 → 2656.90] decades
[2656.90 → 2657.12] of
[2657.12 → 2657.50] danger
[2657.50 → 2658.52] and
[2658.52 → 2659.20] discomfort
[2659.20 → 2660.90] and
[2660.90 → 2661.14] God
[2661.14 → 2661.82] commends
[2661.82 → 2662.16] him
[2662.16 → 2662.62] for
[2662.62 → 2662.86] that
[2662.86 → 2663.30] choice
[2663.30 → 2663.50] that
[2663.50 → 2663.66] he
[2663.66 → 2663.92] made
[2663.92 → 2664.10] in
[2664.10 → 2664.46] faith
[2664.46 → 2666.40] okay
[2666.40 → 2666.66] and so
[2666.66 → 2666.84] what
[2666.84 → 2667.14] happens
[2667.14 → 2667.62] next
[2667.62 → 2668.94] verse
[2668.94 → 2669.54] 27
[2669.54 → 2670.54] by
[2670.54 → 2671.08] faith
[2671.08 → 2671.62] he
[2671.62 → 2671.98] left
[2671.98 → 2672.38] Egypt
[2672.38 → 2672.72] not
[2672.72 → 2673.12] fearing
[2673.12 → 2673.34] the
[2673.34 → 2673.72] king's
[2673.72 → 2674.06] anger
[2674.06 → 2674.96] he
[2674.96 → 2675.74] persevered
[2675.74 → 2676.02] because
[2676.02 → 2676.36] he
[2676.36 → 2676.66] saw
[2676.66 → 2677.16] him
[2677.16 → 2677.82] who
[2677.82 → 2678.14] is
[2678.14 → 2678.64] invisible
[2678.64 → 2681.30] by
[2681.30 → 2681.74] faith
[2681.74 → 2681.96] he
[2681.96 → 2682.26] left
[2682.26 → 2682.66] Egypt
[2682.66 → 2683.04] not
[2683.04 → 2683.52] fearing
[2683.52 → 2683.76] the
[2683.76 → 2684.14] king's
[2684.14 → 2684.48] anger
[2684.48 → 2685.48] fear
[2685.48 → 2686.32] think
[2686.32 → 2686.34] think
[2686.34 → 2686.76] about
[2686.76 → 2687.48] all
[2687.48 → 2688.74] that
[2688.74 → 2689.32] Moses
[2689.32 → 2691.02] could
[2691.02 → 2691.50] possibly
[2691.50 → 2692.10] fear
[2692.10 → 2692.98] right
[2692.98 → 2693.42] in the
[2693.42 → 2693.88] task
[2693.88 → 2694.24] that God
[2694.24 → 2694.38] had
[2694.38 → 2694.62] called
[2694.62 → 2694.74] him
[2694.74 → 2694.92] to
[2694.92 → 2696.06] of
[2696.06 → 2696.32] course
[2696.32 → 2696.68] there's
[2696.68 → 2696.86] the
[2696.86 → 2697.18] fear
[2697.18 → 2697.80] facing
[2697.80 → 2698.68] Pharaoh
[2698.68 → 2699.48] the
[2699.48 → 2699.68] most
[2699.68 → 2700.18] powerful
[2700.18 → 2700.98] man
[2700.98 → 2701.36] in the
[2701.36 → 2701.64] world
[2701.64 → 2701.92] the
[2701.92 → 2702.62] powerful
[2702.62 → 2703.18] tyrant
[2703.18 → 2703.92] and
[2703.92 → 2704.36] confronting
[2704.36 → 2704.62] the
[2704.62 → 2704.98] evils
[2704.98 → 2705.18] and the
[2705.18 → 2705.52] oppression
[2705.52 → 2706.56] of the
[2706.56 → 2706.96] Egyptians
[2706.96 → 2708.80] you know
[2708.80 → 2709.36] and there
[2709.36 → 2709.82] was also
[2709.82 → 2710.30] fear
[2710.30 → 2710.90] of
[2710.90 → 2711.46] leadership
[2711.46 → 2712.24] trying to
[2712.24 → 2712.80] convince a
[2712.80 → 2713.16] whole
[2713.16 → 2713.76] nation
[2713.76 → 2714.90] to
[2714.90 → 2715.38] follow
[2715.38 → 2715.84] him
[2715.84 → 2718.00] there
[2718.00 → 2718.28] was the
[2718.28 → 2718.56] fear
[2718.56 → 2718.86] of being
[2718.86 → 2719.02] a
[2719.02 → 2719.34] prophet
[2719.34 → 2720.10] of
[2720.10 → 2720.48] saying
[2720.48 → 2721.00] thus
[2721.00 → 2721.46] saith
[2721.46 → 2721.76] the
[2721.76 → 2722.14] Lord
[2722.14 → 2723.24] speaking
[2723.24 → 2723.72] God's
[2723.72 → 2724.02] word
[2724.02 → 2724.50] to a
[2724.50 → 2724.82] world
[2724.82 → 2725.00] that
[2725.00 → 2725.32] doesn't
[2725.32 → 2725.58] really
[2725.58 → 2725.80] want
[2725.80 → 2725.90] to
[2725.90 → 2726.08] hear
[2726.08 → 2726.32] it
[2726.32 → 2728.10] there
[2728.10 → 2728.24] was
[2728.24 → 2728.40] the
[2728.40 → 2728.66] fear
[2728.66 → 2728.82] of
[2728.82 → 2729.12] personal
[2729.12 → 2729.72] weakness
[2729.72 → 2729.98] right
[2729.98 → 2730.34] remember
[2730.34 → 2730.70] Moses
[2730.70 → 2731.34] told
[2731.34 → 2731.66] God
[2731.66 → 2732.06] I'm
[2732.06 → 2732.18] not
[2732.18 → 2732.32] the
[2732.32 → 2732.46] right
[2732.46 → 2732.66] guy
[2732.66 → 2732.82] for
[2732.82 → 2732.94] the
[2732.94 → 2733.30] job
[2733.30 → 2733.56] I
[2733.56 → 2733.80] don't
[2733.80 → 2734.04] speak
[2734.04 → 2734.28] very
[2734.28 → 2734.56] well
[2734.56 → 2737.16] and I
[2737.16 → 2737.46] wonder
[2737.46 → 2737.84] if there
[2737.84 → 2738.28] was maybe
[2738.28 → 2738.82] the fear
[2738.82 → 2739.26] of going
[2739.26 → 2739.70] home
[2739.70 → 2740.80] right
[2740.80 → 2741.56] facing his
[2741.56 → 2741.90] own
[2741.90 → 2742.34] Egyptian
[2742.34 → 2742.84] family
[2742.84 → 2743.58] that
[2743.58 → 2743.92] raised
[2743.92 → 2744.16] him
[2744.16 → 2745.88] right
[2745.88 → 2746.04] there
[2746.04 → 2746.42] are a
[2746.42 → 2746.70] lot
[2746.70 → 2746.84] of
[2746.84 → 2747.26] reasons
[2747.26 → 2747.64] Moses
[2747.64 → 2748.06] could
[2748.06 → 2748.26] have
[2748.26 → 2748.70] decided
[2748.70 → 2749.64] no
[2749.64 → 2750.08] thanks
[2750.08 → 2750.74] right
[2750.74 → 2750.90] I
[2750.90 → 2751.36] don't
[2751.36 → 2751.62] want
[2751.62 → 2751.74] to
[2751.74 → 2751.84] do
[2751.84 → 2752.06] this
[2752.06 → 2752.30] it's
[2752.30 → 2752.66] too
[2752.66 → 2753.28] difficult
[2753.28 → 2753.74] it
[2753.74 → 2753.94] is
[2753.94 → 2754.42] too
[2754.42 → 2755.48] dangerous
[2755.48 → 2759.38] but he
[2759.38 → 2759.74] didn't
[2759.74 → 2760.30] fear the
[2760.30 → 2760.60] king's
[2760.60 → 2760.94] anger
[2760.94 → 2761.50] right
[2761.50 → 2761.80] God
[2761.80 → 2762.00] had
[2762.00 → 2762.52] promised
[2762.52 → 2762.78] that
[2762.78 → 2763.46] he
[2763.46 → 2763.84] would
[2763.84 → 2764.06] be
[2764.06 → 2764.36] with
[2764.36 → 2764.82] Moses
[2764.82 → 2765.90] and so
[2765.90 → 2766.16] by
[2766.16 → 2766.72] faith
[2766.72 → 2768.36] Moses
[2768.36 → 2769.68] trusted
[2769.68 → 2770.52] in God's
[2770.52 → 2771.24] presence
[2771.24 → 2771.66] and his
[2771.66 → 2772.06] promises
[2772.06 → 2773.08] and he
[2773.08 → 2773.50] was able
[2773.50 → 2773.92] then to
[2773.92 → 2774.52] reject
[2774.52 → 2775.52] the fear
[2775.52 → 2776.10] that he
[2776.10 → 2776.28] would
[2776.28 → 2776.78] naturally
[2776.78 → 2777.24] fear
[2777.24 → 2778.08] feel
[2778.08 → 2778.64] right
[2778.64 → 2779.18] and he
[2779.18 → 2779.56] was then
[2779.56 → 2779.86] able
[2779.86 → 2780.44] to
[2780.44 → 2781.00] persevere
[2781.00 → 2782.54] and so
[2782.54 → 2782.82] what does
[2782.82 → 2783.04] it means
[2783.04 → 2783.78] to persevere
[2783.78 → 2785.42] it means
[2785.42 → 2785.78] that the
[2785.78 → 2786.18] choice
[2786.18 → 2786.54] that he
[2786.54 → 2787.18] faced
[2787.18 → 2787.78] that he
[2787.78 → 2788.10] made
[2788.10 → 2788.78] to trust
[2788.78 → 2789.26] God
[2789.26 → 2790.68] to trust
[2790.68 → 2790.96] God's
[2790.96 → 2791.44] faithfulness
[2791.44 → 2791.80] it wasn't
[2791.80 → 2792.10] just a
[2792.10 → 2792.46] one-time
[2792.46 → 2792.80] event
[2792.80 → 2793.54] it wasn't
[2793.54 → 2794.26] a one-time
[2794.26 → 2794.64] decision
[2794.64 → 2795.18] okay I'm
[2795.18 → 2795.50] going to trust
[2795.50 → 2795.88] God
[2795.88 → 2796.40] and then
[2796.40 → 2796.74] it's just
[2796.74 → 2797.28] that's it
[2797.28 → 2798.40] it was a
[2798.40 → 2798.76] choice
[2798.76 → 2799.20] that he
[2799.20 → 2799.70] had to
[2799.70 → 2799.90] make
[2799.90 → 2800.28] over
[2800.28 → 2800.86] and over
[2800.86 → 2801.34] again
[2801.34 → 2802.52] as he
[2802.52 → 2802.94] faced
[2802.94 → 2803.50] many
[2803.50 → 2803.88] different
[2803.88 → 2804.38] trials
[2804.38 → 2805.52] over
[2805.52 → 2806.78] his
[2806.78 → 2807.20] life
[2807.20 → 2808.46] right
[2808.46 → 2808.72] and so
[2808.72 → 2809.50] to persevere
[2809.50 → 2810.02] means
[2810.02 → 2811.08] we choose
[2811.08 → 2812.06] to follow
[2812.06 → 2812.84] the long
[2812.84 → 2813.52] path
[2813.52 → 2814.50] to joy
[2814.50 → 2815.62] and we
[2815.62 → 2816.00] have to
[2816.00 → 2816.46] make that
[2816.46 → 2816.82] same
[2816.82 → 2817.34] choice
[2817.34 → 2818.08] over
[2818.08 → 2819.12] and over
[2819.12 → 2819.46] again
[2819.46 → 2820.04] to trust
[2820.04 → 2820.42] God
[2820.42 → 2821.84] to believe
[2821.84 → 2822.38] that
[2822.38 → 2824.30] identifying
[2824.30 → 2824.88] with Christ
[2824.88 → 2825.40] is more
[2825.40 → 2825.80] valuable
[2825.80 → 2826.28] than all
[2826.28 → 2826.62] that the
[2826.62 → 2826.78] world
[2826.78 → 2827.22] can offer
[2827.22 → 2827.58] us
[2827.58 → 2829.84] you know
[2829.84 → 2830.16] one of
[2830.16 → 2830.72] Moses's
[2830.72 → 2830.98] most
[2830.98 → 2831.46] difficult
[2831.46 → 2832.02] trials
[2832.02 → 2832.62] was when
[2832.62 → 2833.14] the people
[2833.14 → 2833.82] he led
[2833.82 → 2834.60] wanted to
[2834.60 → 2835.08] go back
[2835.08 → 2835.70] to Egypt
[2835.70 → 2837.48] even to
[2837.48 → 2837.84] go back
[2837.84 → 2838.54] to slavery
[2838.54 → 2839.76] because
[2839.76 → 2840.56] it was
[2840.56 → 2841.00] easier
[2841.00 → 2842.40] right
[2842.40 → 2842.90] in Egypt
[2842.90 → 2843.40] they knew
[2843.40 → 2843.72] where their
[2843.72 → 2844.14] next meal
[2844.14 → 2844.42] was gonna
[2844.42 → 2844.92] come from
[2844.92 → 2845.92] they knew
[2845.92 → 2846.22] where their
[2846.22 → 2846.68] next drink
[2846.68 → 2847.14] of water
[2847.14 → 2847.50] was gonna
[2847.50 → 2848.12] come from
[2848.12 → 2849.60] but out
[2849.60 → 2850.22] in the desert
[2850.22 → 2850.86] in the wilderness
[2850.86 → 2851.52] they had to
[2851.52 → 2852.02] depend
[2852.02 → 2853.16] on God
[2853.16 → 2855.02] every day
[2855.02 → 2856.28] and upon
[2856.28 → 2856.64] God's
[2856.64 → 2857.04] provision
[2857.04 → 2859.18] and they
[2859.18 → 2859.46] sometimes
[2859.46 → 2860.40] even complained
[2860.40 → 2861.66] that this
[2861.66 → 2862.18] food that
[2862.18 → 2862.76] God provided
[2862.76 → 2863.00] them
[2863.00 → 2863.58] this supernatural
[2863.58 → 2864.28] food
[2864.28 → 2865.08] well it
[2865.08 → 2865.50] wasn't as
[2865.50 → 2865.96] delicious
[2865.96 → 2867.38] or plentiful
[2867.38 → 2868.24] as the cuisine
[2868.24 → 2868.92] available to
[2868.92 → 2869.26] them in
[2869.26 → 2869.58] Egypt
[2869.58 → 2872.80] but despite
[2872.80 → 2874.36] these frustrations
[2874.36 → 2874.76] Moses
[2874.76 → 2875.94] persevered
[2875.94 → 2877.00] he chose
[2877.00 → 2877.74] to identify
[2877.74 → 2878.22] with God
[2878.22 → 2878.56] and his
[2878.56 → 2878.92] people
[2878.92 → 2879.58] and he
[2879.58 → 2880.32] chose again
[2880.32 → 2881.32] and again
[2881.32 → 2882.22] over
[2882.22 → 2883.04] and over
[2883.04 → 2884.82] you know
[2884.82 → 2885.26] even though
[2885.26 → 2885.88] he faced
[2885.88 → 2886.62] discouragement
[2886.62 → 2887.88] even though
[2887.88 → 2888.44] he had
[2888.44 → 2888.92] his own
[2888.92 → 2889.50] flaws
[2889.50 → 2890.36] Moses
[2890.36 → 2891.42] persevered
[2891.42 → 2891.74] in what
[2891.74 → 2892.50] we call
[2892.50 → 2893.30] his
[2893.30 → 2894.14] discipleship
[2894.14 → 2895.36] right
[2895.36 → 2895.72] and God
[2895.72 → 2896.22] commended
[2896.22 → 2896.70] him for
[2896.70 → 2896.94] it
[2896.94 → 2897.26] and the
[2897.26 → 2897.54] scriptures
[2897.54 → 2898.04] say
[2898.04 → 2899.04] he is
[2899.04 → 2899.48] an example
[2899.48 → 2900.08] to us
[2900.08 → 2901.60] now
[2901.60 → 2902.72] verse 28
[2902.72 → 2903.56] continues
[2903.56 → 2904.26] says
[2904.26 → 2904.96] by faith
[2904.96 → 2905.74] he kept
[2905.74 → 2906.36] the Passover
[2906.36 → 2907.08] and the
[2907.08 → 2907.64] application
[2907.64 → 2908.36] of blood
[2908.36 → 2909.32] so that
[2909.32 → 2910.04] the destroyer
[2910.04 → 2910.74] of the firstborn
[2910.74 → 2911.14] would not
[2911.14 → 2911.64] touch
[2911.64 → 2912.68] the firstborn
[2912.68 → 2913.16] of Israel
[2913.16 → 2915.20] so you will
[2915.20 → 2915.80] remember
[2915.80 → 2916.28] Pharaoh
[2916.28 → 2917.84] he didn't
[2917.84 → 2918.42] want to
[2918.42 → 2918.86] let the
[2918.86 → 2919.10] Hebrews
[2919.10 → 2919.46] go
[2919.46 → 2920.90] he despised
[2920.90 → 2921.36] them as a
[2921.36 → 2921.70] people
[2921.70 → 2922.48] but he
[2922.48 → 2922.84] wanted
[2922.84 → 2923.46] their labour
[2923.46 → 2925.42] and the
[2925.42 → 2925.90] plagues
[2925.90 → 2927.04] unleashed
[2927.04 → 2927.76] by Moses
[2927.76 → 2928.94] they grew
[2928.94 → 2929.54] worse and
[2929.54 → 2929.86] worse
[2929.86 → 2930.34] until the
[2930.34 → 2931.12] final plague
[2931.12 → 2931.92] which was
[2931.92 → 2932.42] the death
[2932.42 → 2932.90] of all
[2932.90 → 2933.56] the firstborn
[2933.56 → 2934.10] of all
[2934.10 → 2935.20] the male
[2935.20 → 2936.06] humans
[2936.06 → 2936.92] and animals
[2936.92 → 2937.72] in Egypt
[2937.72 → 2939.72] but God
[2939.72 → 2940.74] provided a way
[2940.74 → 2941.72] of deliverance
[2941.72 → 2942.92] God's people
[2942.92 → 2943.40] were given
[2943.40 → 2944.10] the Passover
[2944.10 → 2945.40] and the
[2945.40 → 2946.24] blood of the
[2946.24 → 2946.84] lamb was
[2946.84 → 2947.52] applied to
[2947.52 → 2947.92] the door
[2947.92 → 2948.20] of the
[2948.20 → 2948.60] house
[2948.60 → 2949.68] so that
[2949.68 → 2950.66] the destroyer
[2950.66 → 2951.76] the death
[2951.76 → 2952.26] angel
[2952.26 → 2953.14] would pass
[2953.14 → 2953.60] over them
[2953.60 → 2953.96] on its
[2953.96 → 2954.42] terrible
[2954.42 → 2955.90] awful task
[2955.90 → 2956.32] of killing
[2956.32 → 2957.14] the firstborns
[2957.14 → 2957.70] who were not
[2957.70 → 2958.60] protected by
[2958.60 → 2959.00] the blood
[2959.00 → 2961.10] now the
[2961.10 → 2961.44] point
[2961.44 → 2962.34] what's the
[2962.34 → 2962.82] point here
[2962.82 → 2963.24] the point
[2963.24 → 2963.64] is
[2963.64 → 2964.74] that there
[2964.74 → 2965.16] had never
[2965.16 → 2965.54] been a
[2965.54 → 2965.92] Passover
[2965.92 → 2966.52] before
[2966.52 → 2967.00] right
[2967.00 → 2967.50] this was a
[2967.50 → 2968.14] unique
[2968.14 → 2968.56] thing
[2968.56 → 2969.80] and it
[2969.80 → 2970.04] was a
[2970.04 → 2970.84] very costly
[2970.84 → 2971.32] thing
[2971.32 → 2971.88] and the
[2971.88 → 2972.72] instructions
[2972.72 → 2973.30] were very
[2973.30 → 2974.02] strange
[2974.02 → 2976.16] but the
[2976.16 → 2976.80] instructions
[2976.80 → 2978.12] came from
[2978.12 → 2978.50] God
[2978.50 → 2979.24] right
[2979.24 → 2979.84] and Moses
[2979.84 → 2981.16] obeyed the
[2981.16 → 2981.70] instructions
[2981.70 → 2982.30] to the
[2982.30 → 2982.62] letter
[2982.62 → 2983.98] and so
[2983.98 → 2984.64] Israel was
[2984.64 → 2985.06] saved
[2985.06 → 2985.54] because
[2985.54 → 2986.00] Moses
[2986.00 → 2986.62] believed
[2986.62 → 2987.04] in God's
[2987.04 → 2987.32] word
[2987.32 → 2988.20] and Moses
[2988.20 → 2988.74] acted
[2988.74 → 2989.26] on God's
[2989.26 → 2989.50] word
[2989.50 → 2991.60] in the
[2991.60 → 2992.00] great
[2992.00 → 2992.88] deliverance
[2992.88 → 2993.48] from slavery
[2993.48 → 2994.12] in Egypt
[2994.12 → 2994.64] it wasn't
[2994.64 → 2995.16] enough
[2995.16 → 2995.86] just to
[2995.86 → 2996.20] be a
[2996.20 → 2996.54] Hebrew
[2996.54 → 2998.20] you had
[2998.20 → 2999.00] to apply
[2999.00 → 2999.68] the blood
[2999.68 → 3000.08] of the
[3000.08 → 3000.34] lamb
[3000.34 → 3002.16] and friends
[3002.16 → 3002.42] it's the
[3002.42 → 3002.74] same for
[3002.74 → 3003.22] us today
[3003.22 → 3005.16] right
[3005.16 → 3005.58] it's not
[3005.58 → 3006.00] enough
[3006.00 → 3006.46] to be
[3006.46 → 3006.78] to
[3006.78 → 3007.22] you know
[3007.22 → 3007.76] grow up
[3007.76 → 3007.96] in a
[3007.96 → 3008.16] Christian
[3008.16 → 3008.58] family
[3008.58 → 3010.12] or to
[3010.12 → 3010.36] be
[3010.36 → 3010.72] baptized
[3010.72 → 3011.34] into
[3011.34 → 3011.56] the
[3011.56 → 3012.00] church
[3012.00 → 3013.52] salvation
[3013.52 → 3014.76] comes
[3014.76 → 3015.16] through
[3015.16 → 3015.60] believing
[3015.60 → 3016.04] God's
[3016.04 → 3016.32] word
[3016.32 → 3017.24] and
[3017.24 → 3017.78] applying
[3017.78 → 3018.24] the
[3018.24 → 3018.60] blood
[3018.60 → 3019.28] of
[3019.28 → 3019.58] Jesus
[3019.58 → 3019.86] the
[3019.86 → 3020.12] lamb
[3020.12 → 3020.28] of
[3020.28 → 3020.60] God
[3020.60 → 3020.76] who
[3020.76 → 3021.04] takes
[3021.04 → 3021.30] away
[3021.30 → 3021.52] the
[3021.52 → 3021.82] sins
[3021.82 → 3022.02] of
[3022.02 → 3022.14] the
[3022.14 → 3022.40] world
[3022.40 → 3025.96] so
[3025.96 → 3026.36] after
[3026.36 → 3028.02] they
[3028.02 → 3028.30] ate
[3028.30 → 3028.44] the
[3028.44 → 3028.92] Passover
[3028.92 → 3029.96] those
[3029.96 → 3030.28] bitter
[3030.28 → 3030.94] herbs
[3030.94 → 3032.06] dressed
[3032.06 → 3032.42] ready
[3032.42 → 3032.62] to
[3032.62 → 3032.94] go
[3032.94 → 3034.16] Moses
[3034.16 → 3034.44] then
[3034.44 → 3034.82] led
[3034.82 → 3035.04] the
[3035.04 → 3035.46] people
[3035.46 → 3036.18] out
[3036.18 → 3036.46] of
[3036.46 → 3036.66] their
[3036.66 → 3037.08] slavery
[3037.08 → 3037.86] in
[3037.86 → 3038.24] Egypt
[3038.24 → 3039.38] in
[3039.38 → 3039.60] verse
[3039.60 → 3040.06] 29
[3040.06 → 3041.50] says
[3041.50 → 3042.68] by
[3042.68 → 3043.18] faith
[3043.18 → 3043.44] the
[3043.44 → 3043.84] people
[3043.84 → 3044.44] passed
[3044.44 → 3044.72] through
[3044.72 → 3044.94] the
[3044.94 → 3045.12] Red
[3045.12 → 3045.38] Sea
[3045.38 → 3045.70] as
[3045.70 → 3045.88] on
[3045.88 → 3046.08] dry
[3046.08 → 3046.52] land
[3046.52 → 3047.14] but
[3047.14 → 3047.30] when
[3047.30 → 3047.44] the
[3047.44 → 3047.78] Egyptians
[3047.78 → 3048.12] tried
[3048.12 → 3048.24] to
[3048.24 → 3048.40] do
[3048.40 → 3048.56] so
[3048.56 → 3048.70] they
[3048.70 → 3048.84] were
[3048.84 → 3049.24] drowned
[3049.24 → 3050.96] see
[3050.96 → 3051.16] when
[3051.16 → 3051.48] when
[3051.48 → 3051.68] Pharaoh
[3051.68 → 3051.96] let
[3051.96 → 3052.12] them
[3052.12 → 3052.66] go
[3052.66 → 3053.12] things
[3053.12 → 3053.46] got
[3053.46 → 3053.88] worse
[3053.88 → 3054.24] before
[3054.24 → 3054.44] they
[3054.44 → 3054.62] got
[3054.62 → 3054.96] better
[3054.96 → 3055.94] because
[3055.94 → 3056.42] Pharaoh
[3056.42 → 3057.58] regretted
[3057.58 → 3057.80] his
[3057.80 → 3058.26] decision
[3058.26 → 3058.74] and
[3058.74 → 3059.32] chased
[3059.32 → 3059.64] them
[3059.64 → 3060.12] down
[3060.12 → 3060.64] with
[3060.64 → 3060.82] his
[3060.82 → 3061.12] army
[3061.12 → 3062.68] the
[3062.68 → 3063.00] Hebrews
[3063.00 → 3063.32] found
[3063.32 → 3063.80] themselves
[3063.80 → 3064.42] between
[3064.42 → 3065.12] a
[3065.12 → 3065.50] sea
[3065.50 → 3065.74] they
[3065.74 → 3065.96] could
[3065.96 → 3066.14] not
[3066.14 → 3066.70] cross
[3066.70 → 3068.00] in
[3068.00 → 3068.32] front
[3068.32 → 3068.70] and an
[3068.70 → 3069.00] army
[3069.00 → 3069.22] they
[3069.22 → 3069.44] could
[3069.44 → 3069.64] not
[3069.64 → 3070.00] beat
[3070.00 → 3070.56] from
[3070.56 → 3071.10] behind
[3071.10 → 3071.62] an
[3071.62 → 3071.92] army
[3071.92 → 3072.10] that
[3072.10 → 3072.22] was
[3072.22 → 3072.38] going
[3072.38 → 3072.52] to
[3072.52 → 3072.80] slaughter
[3072.80 → 3073.12] them
[3073.12 → 3074.24] and
[3074.24 → 3074.60] those
[3074.60 → 3075.26] that
[3075.26 → 3075.48] the
[3075.48 → 3075.68] army
[3075.68 → 3076.04] didn't
[3076.04 → 3076.34] kill
[3076.34 → 3076.60] they
[3076.60 → 3076.74] would
[3076.74 → 3076.96] bring
[3076.96 → 3077.28] back
[3077.28 → 3077.50] into
[3077.50 → 3077.86] slavery
[3077.86 → 3078.30] again
[3078.30 → 3079.94] but
[3079.94 → 3080.22] in
[3080.22 → 3080.50] a
[3080.50 → 3080.86] mighty
[3080.86 → 3081.22] act
[3081.22 → 3081.34] of
[3081.34 → 3081.94] deliverance
[3081.94 → 3082.24] that
[3082.24 → 3082.64] Israel
[3082.64 → 3082.94] would
[3082.94 → 3083.52] always
[3083.52 → 3084.12] recall
[3084.12 → 3084.38] and
[3084.38 → 3084.92] celebrate
[3084.92 → 3085.54] they
[3085.54 → 3085.74] were
[3085.74 → 3086.16] rescued
[3086.16 → 3086.94] right
[3086.94 → 3087.10] and
[3087.10 → 3087.24] their
[3087.24 → 3087.72] identity
[3087.72 → 3088.14] would
[3088.14 → 3088.42] then
[3088.42 → 3088.60] be
[3088.60 → 3088.80] the
[3088.80 → 3089.12] people
[3089.12 → 3089.34] of
[3089.34 → 3089.48] the
[3089.48 → 3089.92] exodus
[3089.92 → 3090.78] the
[3090.78 → 3091.20] people
[3091.20 → 3091.66] whose
[3091.66 → 3092.06] God
[3092.06 → 3092.86] responded
[3092.86 → 3093.94] with
[3093.94 → 3094.12] a
[3094.12 → 3094.44] mighty
[3094.44 → 3095.04] salvation
[3095.04 → 3096.74] and
[3096.74 → 3097.06] Moses
[3097.06 → 3097.44] would
[3097.44 → 3097.90] become
[3097.90 → 3098.10] the
[3098.10 → 3098.50] great
[3098.50 → 3099.16] hero
[3099.16 → 3100.16] of
[3100.16 → 3100.46] the
[3100.46 → 3100.84] people
[3100.84 → 3101.16] of
[3101.16 → 3101.58] Israel
[3101.58 → 3104.78] but
[3104.78 → 3104.94] what
[3104.94 → 3105.08] we
[3105.08 → 3105.32] learn
[3105.32 → 3105.68] friends
[3105.68 → 3106.02] as we
[3106.02 → 3106.26] now
[3106.26 → 3106.64] go
[3106.64 → 3106.98] into
[3106.98 → 3107.18] the
[3107.18 → 3107.36] New
[3107.36 → 3107.74] Testament
[3107.74 → 3108.56] is
[3108.56 → 3108.72] that
[3108.72 → 3108.90] the
[3108.90 → 3109.20] true
[3109.20 → 3109.94] deliverer
[3109.94 → 3110.08] of
[3110.08 → 3110.44] God's
[3110.44 → 3110.84] people
[3110.84 → 3111.90] who
[3111.90 → 3112.36] Moses
[3112.36 → 3112.86] was
[3112.86 → 3113.10] a
[3113.10 → 3113.56] picture
[3113.56 → 3113.82] and

[3116.04 → 3116.44] Christ
[3116.44 → 3116.90] himself

[3117.86 → 3118.00] and
[3118.00 → 3118.16] this
[3118.16 → 3118.42] is
[3118.42 → 3118.94] how

[3122.22 → 3122.50] 10
[3122.50 → 3122.80] this is
[3122.80 → 3122.92] what
[3122.92 → 3123.04] it
[3123.04 → 3123.40] says
[3123.40 → 3124.44] this is
[3124.44 → 3124.66] Paul
[3124.66 → 3124.96] writing
[3124.96 → 3125.12] to

[3137.78 → 3138.02] that
[3138.02 → 3138.54] accompanied
[3138.54 → 3139.02] them
[3139.02 → 3139.48] and
[3139.48 → 3139.72] that
[3142.36 → 3144.92] you
[3144.92 → 3145.16] see
[3145.16 → 3145.64] Moses
[3145.64 → 3146.64] was
[3146.64 → 3147.58] a
[3147.58 → 3148.08] leader
[3148.08 → 3148.90] and

[3150.86 → 3151.16] giver
[3151.16 → 3151.38] and
[3151.38 → 3151.54] a
[3151.54 → 3151.88] prophet
[3151.88 → 3153.42] but
[3153.42 → 3153.80] Jesus
[3153.80 → 3154.84] is
[3154.84 → 3155.08] the
[3155.08 → 3155.62] reality
[3155.62 → 3156.06] of
[3156.06 → 3156.32] all
[3156.32 → 3156.44] of
[3156.44 → 3156.64] those
[3156.64 → 3157.04] things
[3157.04 → 3157.54] right
[3157.54 → 3157.68] and
[3157.68 → 3157.80] so
[3157.80 → 3158.14] Moses
[3158.14 → 3158.32] you
[3158.32 → 3158.38] know
[3158.38 → 3158.50] he
[3158.50 → 3158.62] was
[3158.62 → 3158.78] a
[3158.78 → 3159.10] prophet
[3159.10 → 3159.68] in
[3159.68 → 3159.90] fact
[3159.90 → 3160.12] he
[3160.12 → 3160.30] was
[3160.30 → 3160.50] the
[3160.50 → 3160.98] greatest
[3160.98 → 3161.46] prophet
[3161.46 → 3161.66] of
[3161.66 → 3162.08] Israel
[3162.08 → 3163.24] because
[3163.24 → 3163.52] with
[3163.52 → 3163.94] Moses
[3163.94 → 3164.44] God
[3164.44 → 3165.06] spoke

[3165.94 → 3166.22] to
[3166.22 → 3166.78] face
[3166.78 → 3168.10] but
[3168.10 → 3168.46] Christ
[3168.46 → 3168.82] didn't
[3168.82 → 3169.24] just
[3169.24 → 3169.76] speak
[3169.76 → 3170.14] the
[3170.14 → 3170.32] word
[3170.32 → 3170.46] of
[3170.46 → 3170.78] God
[3170.78 → 3171.02] to
[3171.02 → 3171.20] the
[3171.20 → 3171.52] people
[3171.52 → 3172.06] he
[3172.06 → 3172.74] is
[3172.74 → 3173.16] the
[3173.16 → 3173.56] living
[3173.56 → 3173.98] word
[3173.98 → 3174.24] of
[3174.24 → 3174.60] God
[3174.60 → 3175.48] right
[3175.48 → 3175.62] and
[3175.62 → 3175.76] to
[3175.76 → 3176.08] see
[3176.08 → 3176.60] Jesus
[3176.60 → 3177.02] is
[3177.02 → 3177.18] to
[3177.18 → 3177.38] see
[3177.38 → 3177.56] the
[3177.56 → 3177.90] invisible
[3177.90 → 3178.32] God
[3178.32 → 3179.84] and
[3179.84 → 3180.14] Moses
[3180.14 → 3180.32] he
[3180.32 → 3180.48] was
[3180.48 → 3180.62] a
[3180.62 → 3181.44] deliverer
[3181.44 → 3182.06] freeing
[3182.06 → 3182.22] the
[3182.22 → 3182.46] Hebrews
[3182.46 → 3182.68] from
[3182.68 → 3183.16] slavery
[3183.16 → 3184.28] but
[3184.28 → 3184.72] Christ
[3184.72 → 3185.20] is
[3185.20 → 3185.48] the
[3185.48 → 3185.76] lamb
[3185.76 → 3185.96] of
[3185.96 → 3186.26] God
[3186.26 → 3186.48] that
[3186.48 → 3186.96] every
[3186.96 → 3187.74] Passover
[3187.74 → 3188.30] points
[3188.30 → 3188.62] to
[3188.62 → 3189.96] Jesus
[3189.96 → 3190.22] is
[3190.22 → 3190.38] the
[3190.38 → 3190.64] one
[3190.64 → 3190.86] who
[3190.86 → 3191.32] rescues
[3191.32 → 3191.64] us
[3191.64 → 3192.02] from
[3192.02 → 3192.36] every
[3192.36 → 3192.84] form
[3192.84 → 3193.02] of
[3193.02 → 3193.50] slavery
[3193.50 → 3194.74] and
[3194.74 → 3195.24] from
[3195.24 → 3195.70] sin
[3195.70 → 3196.04] and
[3196.04 → 3196.22] from
[3196.22 → 3196.58] death
[3196.58 → 3199.50] Moses
[3199.50 → 3200.04] was
[3200.04 → 3200.36] a
[3200.36 → 3200.90] lawgiver
[3200.90 → 3201.60] teaching
[3201.60 → 3201.80] the
[3201.80 → 3202.22] people
[3202.22 → 3203.20] God's
[3203.20 → 3203.66] commandments
[3203.66 → 3205.10] but
[3205.10 → 3205.28] the
[3205.28 → 3205.50] law
[3205.50 → 3205.76] was
[3205.76 → 3205.94] a
[3205.94 → 3206.18] school
[3206.18 → 3206.58] teacher
[3206.58 → 3207.14] meant
[3207.14 → 3207.40] to
[3207.40 → 3207.58] lead
[3207.58 → 3207.70] us
[3207.70 → 3207.84] to
[3207.84 → 3208.24] Christ
[3208.24 → 3209.20] and
[3209.20 → 3209.48] Jesus
[3209.48 → 3209.94] kept
[3209.94 → 3210.18] the
[3210.18 → 3210.56] law
[3210.56 → 3210.90] for
[3210.90 → 3211.26] our
[3211.26 → 3211.64] sakes
[3211.64 → 3211.90] in a
[3211.90 → 3212.02] way
[3212.02 → 3212.20] that
[3212.20 → 3212.38] we
[3212.38 → 3212.56] could
[3212.56 → 3212.78] never
[3212.78 → 3213.02] do
[3213.02 → 3213.58] ourselves
[3213.58 → 3215.36] and
[3215.36 → 3215.62] Moses
[3215.62 → 3215.88] was
[3215.88 → 3216.02] a
[3216.02 → 3216.28] leader
[3216.28 → 3216.48] he
[3216.48 → 3216.78] led
[3216.78 → 3216.94] the
[3216.94 → 3217.32] Israelites
[3217.32 → 3217.62] to
[3217.62 → 3217.76] the
[3217.76 → 3217.98] very
[3217.98 → 3218.44] boundary
[3218.44 → 3218.68] of
[3218.68 → 3218.80] the
[3218.80 → 3219.12] promised
[3219.12 → 3219.56] land
[3219.56 → 3220.38] but
[3220.38 → 3220.78] friends
[3220.78 → 3221.78] only
[3221.78 → 3222.20] Jesus
[3222.20 → 3222.48] is
[3222.48 → 3222.78] able
[3222.78 → 3222.98] to

[3223.16 → 3223.30] us
[3223.30 → 3223.72] across
[3223.72 → 3224.68] right
[3224.68 → 3224.88] to

[3225.18 → 3225.72] us
[3225.72 → 3226.08] across
[3226.08 → 3226.36] not
[3226.36 → 3226.56] to
[3226.56 → 3226.72] a
[3226.72 → 3226.96] land
[3226.96 → 3227.12] of
[3227.12 → 3227.32] milk

[3230.90 → 3231.42] peace
[3231.42 → 3231.64] and
[3231.64 → 3232.10] justice
[3232.10 → 3234.28] and
[3234.28 → 3234.48] friends
[3234.48 → 3234.80] what we
[3234.80 → 3235.26] celebrate
[3235.26 → 3235.58] at
[3235.58 → 3235.90] Christmas
[3235.90 → 3236.96] is
[3236.96 → 3237.14] that
[3237.14 → 3237.64] this
[3237.64 → 3238.64] invisible
[3238.64 → 3239.30] God
[3239.30 → 3240.06] who
[3240.06 → 3240.48] Moses
[3240.48 → 3241.10] saw
[3241.10 → 3241.38] with
[3241.38 → 3241.56] the
[3241.56 → 3241.82] eyes
[3241.82 → 3242.00] of
[3242.00 → 3242.32] faith
[3242.32 → 3242.92] he
[3242.92 → 3243.08] did
[3243.08 → 3243.26] not
[3243.26 → 3243.52] stay
[3243.52 → 3243.94] invisible
[3243.94 → 3244.90] right
[3244.90 → 3245.04] but
[3245.04 → 3245.22] he
[3245.22 → 3245.60] became
[3245.60 → 3246.34] very
[3246.34 → 3246.92] visible
[3246.92 → 3248.14] in
[3248.14 → 3248.38] the
[3248.38 → 3248.70] person
[3248.70 → 3248.86] of
[3248.86 → 3249.06] Jesus
[3249.06 → 3249.48] Christ
[3249.48 → 3252.58] so
[3252.58 → 3252.88] friends
[3252.88 → 3253.12] think
[3253.12 → 3253.34] about

[3253.48 → 3253.70] life
[3253.70 → 3253.90] this
[3253.90 → 3254.14] morning
[3254.14 → 3255.70] think
[3255.70 → 3255.92] about
[3255.92 → 3256.10] your
[3256.10 → 3256.30] own
[3256.30 → 3256.50] life
[3256.50 → 3256.68] this
[3256.68 → 3256.96] morning
[3256.96 → 3258.86] what
[3258.86 → 3258.98] do
[3258.98 → 3259.08] you
[3259.08 → 3259.26] think

[3259.38 → 3259.56] make
[3259.56 → 3259.68] you
[3259.68 → 3260.04] happy
[3260.04 → 3263.02] if
[3263.02 → 3263.12] you
[3263.12 → 3263.24] were
[3263.24 → 3263.40] to
[3263.40 → 3263.80] write
[3263.80 → 3264.00] a
[3264.00 → 3264.18] letter
[3264.18 → 3264.38] to
[3264.38 → 3264.84] God
[3264.84 → 3265.88] telling
[3265.88 → 3266.24] him
[3266.24 → 3266.60] what
[3266.60 → 3266.90] would
[3266.90 → 3267.12] make
[3267.12 → 3267.26] you
[3267.26 → 3267.56] happy
[3267.56 → 3267.78] what
[3267.78 → 3267.94] would
[3267.94 → 3268.04] you
[3268.04 → 3268.26] put
[3268.26 → 3268.36] in
[3268.36 → 3268.50] that
[3268.50 → 3268.78] letter
[3268.78 → 3271.10] and
[3271.10 → 3271.32] as
[3271.32 → 3271.64] we
[3271.64 → 3272.14] meditate
[3272.14 → 3272.44] on
[3272.44 → 3272.58] that
[3272.58 → 3273.12] question
[3273.12 → 3274.16] let
[3274.16 → 3274.32] us
[3274.32 → 3274.56] look
[3274.56 → 3274.76] to
[3274.76 → 3274.94] the
[3274.94 → 3275.44] example
[3275.44 → 3276.26] of
[3276.26 → 3276.72] Moses
[3276.72 → 3278.00] right
[3278.00 → 3278.38] Moses
[3278.38 → 3278.98] shows
[3278.98 → 3279.18] us
[3279.18 → 3279.40] that
[3279.40 → 3279.66] our
[3279.66 → 3280.22] real
[3280.22 → 3280.78] and
[3280.78 → 3281.24] lasting
[3281.24 → 3281.92] happiness
[3281.92 → 3283.00] they're
[3283.00 → 3283.40] not
[3283.40 → 3283.80] found
[3283.80 → 3283.98] in
[3283.98 → 3284.44] anything
[3284.44 → 3284.96] available

[3289.36 → 3289.96] shows
[3289.96 → 3290.28] us
[3290.28 → 3290.56] that
[3290.56 → 3290.70] we
[3290.70 → 3290.88] can
[3290.88 → 3291.38] gladly
[3291.38 → 3292.10] identify
[3292.10 → 3293.26] with
[3293.26 → 3293.56] Jesus
[3293.56 → 3294.00] Christ
[3294.00 → 3294.98] and be
[3294.98 → 3295.32] numbered
[3295.32 → 3295.74] among
[3295.74 → 3296.00] his
[3296.00 → 3296.34] people
[3296.34 → 3297.76] and
[3297.76 → 3297.98] don't
[3297.98 → 3298.10] be
[3298.10 → 3298.52] afraid
[3298.52 → 3298.72] and
[3298.72 → 3298.92] don't
[3298.92 → 3299.32] resist
[3299.32 → 3299.70] the
[3299.70 → 3299.94] Lord
[3299.94 → 3300.16] when
[3300.16 → 3300.34] he
[3300.34 → 3300.76] calls
[3300.76 → 3301.04] you
[3301.04 → 3301.56] in
[3301.56 → 3301.86] his
[3301.86 → 3302.24] grace
[3302.24 → 3302.58] to
[3302.58 → 3302.84] that
[3302.84 → 3303.28] path
[3303.28 → 3303.70] that
[3303.70 → 3304.00] leads
[3304.00 → 3304.18] to
[3304.18 → 3304.38] true
[3304.38 → 3304.78] happiness
[3304.78 → 3306.30] but
[3306.30 → 3306.62] look
[3306.62 → 3307.02] to
[3307.02 → 3307.30] the
[3307.30 → 3307.76] promised
[3307.76 → 3308.28] land
[3308.28 → 3308.52] of
[3308.52 → 3308.94] Christ's
[3308.94 → 3309.24] eternal
[3309.24 → 3309.64] kingdom
[3309.64 → 3311.72] so
[3311.72 → 3311.94] let me
[3311.94 → 3312.10] pray
[3312.10 → 3312.30] that
[3312.30 → 3312.46] God
[3312.46 → 3312.60] would
[3312.60 → 3312.80] help
[3312.80 → 3313.12] us
[3313.12 → 3317.86] O
[3317.86 → 3318.08] Lord
[3318.08 → 3318.26] you
[3318.26 → 3318.40] are
[3318.40 → 3318.56] the
[3318.56 → 3318.84] God
[3318.84 → 3319.00] of
[3319.00 → 3319.46] Enoch
[3319.46 → 3320.72] the
[3320.72 → 3320.98] God
[3320.98 → 3321.14] of
[3321.14 → 3321.48] Noah
[3321.48 → 3322.64] the
[3322.64 → 3323.10] God
[3323.10 → 3323.30] of
[3323.30 → 3323.92] Abraham
[3323.92 → 3325.10] the
[3325.10 → 3325.36] God
[3325.36 → 3325.52] of
[3325.52 → 3325.94] Moses
[3325.94 → 3327.34] thank
[3327.34 → 3327.50] you
[3327.50 → 3327.66] Lord
[3327.66 → 3327.80] for
[3327.80 → 3327.96] the
[3327.96 → 3328.18] joy
[3328.18 → 3328.38] of
[3328.38 → 3328.78] Christmas
[3328.78 → 3329.78] that
[3329.78 → 3329.90] we
[3329.90 → 3330.30] celebrate
[3330.30 → 3330.54] in
[3330.54 → 3330.72] this
[3330.72 → 3331.14] season
[3331.14 → 3331.42] but
[3331.42 → 3331.70] Holy
[3331.70 → 3332.08] Spirit
[3332.08 → 3332.28] we
[3332.28 → 3332.56] ask
[3332.56 → 3332.70] that
[3332.70 → 3332.82] you
[3332.82 → 3332.94] would
[3332.94 → 3333.18] please
[3333.18 → 3333.60] reveal
[3333.60 → 3333.84] to
[3333.84 → 3334.24] each
[3334.24 → 3334.72] heart
[3334.72 → 3336.22] where
[3336.22 → 3337.24] our
[3337.24 → 3337.70] happiness
[3337.70 → 3337.98] is
[3337.98 → 3338.30] found
[3338.30 → 3340.12] Lord
[3340.12 → 3340.42] Jesus
[3340.42 → 3340.70] you
[3340.70 → 3341.14] are
[3341.14 → 3342.20] the
[3342.20 → 3342.70] only
[3342.70 → 3343.42] perfect
[3343.42 → 3344.24] deliverer
[3344.24 → 3344.36] the
[3344.36 → 3344.76] very
[3344.76 → 3345.18] lamb
[3345.18 → 3345.34] of
[3345.34 → 3345.66] God
[3345.66 → 3346.36] and
[3346.36 → 3346.48] we
[3346.48 → 3346.76] ask
[3346.76 → 3346.88] that
[3346.88 → 3347.02] you
[3347.02 → 3347.12] would
[3347.12 → 3347.40] apply
[3347.40 → 3347.64] your
[3347.64 → 3348.04] blood
[3348.04 → 3348.62] to
[3348.62 → 3348.94] each
[3348.94 → 3349.22] heart
[3349.22 → 3349.46] this
[3349.46 → 3349.74] morning
[3349.74 → 3350.88] and
[3350.88 → 3351.02] we
[3351.02 → 3351.20] pray
[3351.20 → 3351.38] in
[3351.38 → 3351.56] Jesus
[3351.56 → 3351.90] name
[3351.90 → 3352.92] Amen
[3352.92 → 3356.10] so
[3356.10 → 3356.24] let's
[3356.24 → 3356.36] all
[3356.36 → 3356.72] stand
[3356.72 → 3357.38] and
[3357.38 → 3357.56] we
[3357.56 → 3357.90] will
[3357.90 → 3358.72] sing
[3358.72 → 3358.86] our
[3358.86 → 3359.04] song
[3359.04 → 3359.14] of
[3359.14 → 3359.54] response
[3372.70 → 3389.46] for
[3389.46 → 3395.16] In the light of creation's brain design
[3395.16 → 3402.04] In the lives of all those who prove its faithfulness
[3402.04 → 3406.56] Who walk by faith and on my side
[3406.56 → 3412.00] Our faith, our fathers, won't be earth
[3412.00 → 3418.54] And the power of its brothers in their hearts
[3418.54 → 3424.54] Come, holy, sin, and born by God's old man
[3424.54 → 3429.26] Our peace, our peace, and justice, free
[3429.26 → 3434.54] We'll stand as children of the promise
[3434.54 → 3441.16] We will raise our eyes on Him, our sons, we will be
[3441.16 → 3446.54] The race is finished, and the work is done
[3446.54 → 3451.54] We'll walk by faith and on my side
[3451.54 → 3456.54] Our faith, our broken quality
[3456.54 → 3462.54] When the love for Messiah would appear
[3462.54 → 3469.82] With a heart to break the chains of sin and death
[3469.82 → 3474.82] And rise triumphant from the grave
[3474.82 → 3479.82] By faith the church was called to go
[3479.82 → 3485.82] In the power of the Spirit to the Lord
[3485.82 → 3491.82] To deliver the praise and to preach the truth
[3491.82 → 3496.82] In every corner of the earth
[3496.82 → 3502.82] We will stand as children of the promise
[3502.82 → 3503.82] We will raise our hearts
[3503.82 → 3507.82] We will raise our hearts and on my side
[3507.82 → 3509.82] We will raise our hearts and on my side
[3509.82 → 3515.82] And our faith, our sons, and the power of the gospel
[3515.82 → 3520.82] We will raise our hearts and on my side
[3520.82 → 3522.82] By faith, our faithfuls, and the power of the gospel
[3522.82 → 3523.82] We will raise our hearts and on my side
[3523.82 → 3525.82] We will raise our hearts and on my side
[3525.82 → 3531.18] And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[3531.18 → 3537.02] For we know in whose things are possible
[3537.02 → 3541.96] For all who call upon we see
[3541.96 → 3547.90] We will stand as children of the promise
[3547.90 → 3554.28] We will take sunrise on if our souls be whole
[3554.28 → 3560.28] Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3560.28 → 3565.14] We'll walk by faith and not by faith
[3565.14 → 3571.14] We will stand as children of the promise
[3571.14 → 3576.82] We will fix the horizon if our souls be whole
[3576.82 → 3583.28] Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3583.28 → 3587.28] We will walk by faith and not by faith
[3587.28 → 3610.28] Before we go to our community prayer, I have some sad news to share with you.
[3610.28 → 3617.28] Early this week the daughter of Brian and Sonia van der Mueller stopped breathing in her sleep
[3617.28 → 3620.28] And passed away into the arms of Jesus
[3620.28 → 3624.28] Her name was Tess, and she had just turned one
[3624.28 → 3628.28] Brian van der Mueller had been a long-time member of this church
[3628.28 → 3635.28] He is the son of Harry and Marian van der Mueller
[3635.28 → 3638.28] And the nephew of Annette Vermeer
[3638.28 → 3640.28] We'll remember them in our prayer
[3640.28 → 3646.28] So as children of the promise, let us go to God in prayer
[3646.28 → 3656.28] God our hope and our comfort
[3656.28 → 3660.28] We rejoice that you became flesh and made your dwelling among us
[3660.28 → 3663.28] Even as we long for your return
[3663.28 → 3669.28] As we wait, our hearts overflow with gratitude for the beauty of creation
[3669.28 → 3673.28] For your work in the world
[3673.28 → 3676.28] For the signs of peace and reconciliation
[3676.28 → 3679.28] For our community and its leaders
[3679.28 → 3684.28] And for your work accomplished through your church
[3684.28 → 3689.28] For all these reasons and so much more we give you praise
[3689.28 → 3696.28] As we celebrate the first coming of your son as a helpless child
[3696.28 → 3699.28] We also yearn for his return
[3699.28 → 3706.28] For the day in which there will be no more sorrow, pain, or death
[3706.28 → 3709.28] Today we remember in prayer
[3709.28 → 3711.28] The nations of the world
[3711.28 → 3714.28] Many of whom are experiencing ongoing conflict
[3714.28 → 3719.28] And a rising number of displaced persons and refugees
[3719.28 → 3724.28] We remember in prayer those in authority around the world
[3724.28 → 3731.28] Open their hearts, Lord, to allow for humanitarian aid and peace initiatives
[3731.28 → 3738.28] Turn your face to the church universal, its mission, and those who minister
[3738.28 → 3743.28] Protect those churches who are persecuted because of their faith
[3743.28 → 3749.28] May your worldwide church be a beacon of light in these troubled times
[3749.28 → 3756.28] Bless our missionaries, especially the work of the Johnson's in the BC Interior
[3756.28 → 3759.28] Ajee Amman and Anne Zach in Cairo
[3759.28 → 3763.28] And Hannah Vanderkamp in Lesbos, Greece
[3763.28 → 3767.28] And myriad others who serve you in difficult situations
[3767.28 → 3771.28] Remember our congregation and its ministry
[3771.28 → 3775.28] Especially the preparations for our Christmas Eve event
[3775.28 → 3777.28] And the Christmas morning worship service
[3777.28 → 3782.28] We remember those among us with particular needs
[3782.28 → 3786.28] Be near to Pat Barman, Michael Wayne DeVos
[3786.28 → 3789.28] And Lord, we praise you that he is doing so well
[3789.28 → 3791.28] Continue healing him, we pray
[3791.28 → 3795.28] We pray for Shirley Mass
[3795.28 → 3798.28] For Doug Hideout and Eileen Hideout
[3798.28 → 3801.28] For Hank and Liz Van Beech
[3801.28 → 3803.28] For Tank Ninja
[3803.28 → 3807.28] Father, we pray for healing for Wilma Van Tal who is in the hospital
[3807.28 → 3811.28] And we thank you that Jenny Van Tal can be home again
[3811.28 → 3813.28] After a time in the hospital
[3813.28 → 3819.28] San Dimas is still suffering from Lyme disease
[3819.28 → 3821.28] Lord, heal him
[3821.28 → 3827.28] We thank you for the better health of Grace You, Jenny Kahn's mother
[3827.28 → 3831.28] We pray for your blessing upon Lorna McCrae in her pregnancy
[3831.28 → 3833.28] As she nears her due date
[3833.28 → 3839.28] And our loving Father, we ask that you surround Brian and Sonia Van Der Mule
[3839.28 → 3841.28] And their two young sons
[3841.28 → 3846.28] As they mourn the death of their precious daughter and sister Tess
[3846.28 → 3850.28] May they know your presence and care in these dark days
[3850.28 → 3853.28] Comfort them and their extended family
[3853.28 → 3857.28] With your heavenly, unending love
[3857.28 → 3863.28] We offer these prayers in the name of Jesus Christ, our rock
[3863.28 → 3865.28] Our source of hope
[3865.28 → 3867.28] And grace
[3867.28 → 3869.28] Amen
