[23.12 --> 26.98]  Where'd you read the time of a read..

[296.98 --> 326.96]  Thank you.
[326.96 --> 356.94]  Thank you.
[356.94 --> 360.88]  If you're not sure where the nursery is, I'm sure our wonderful ushers can guide you there.
[361.68 --> 366.64]  So now let us quiet our hearts and turn our attention to God who calls us.
[366.64 --> 368.64]  Please stand if you're able.
[396.64 --> 426.64] 
[426.64 --> 456.64] 
[456.64 --> 458.64]  Thank you.
[458.64 --> 464.64]  In according with the Lord, amen.
[464.64 --> 468.32]  Let's take a moment now to greet our neighbors and then join in song.
[468.32 --> 470.32]  Thank you.
[498.32 --> 500.32]  Thank you.
[528.32 --> 558.32] 
[558.32 --> 560.32]  Thank you.
[560.32 --> 562.32]  This morning,

[671.56 --> 682.64]  Let us bless the Lord
[682.64 --> 686.14]  Every day and night
[686.14 --> 689.58]  Ever-ending praise
[689.58 --> 693.12]  May our incense rise
[693.12 --> 696.50]  Let us bless the Lord
[696.50 --> 699.90]  Every day and night
[699.90 --> 703.34]  Ever-ending praise
[703.34 --> 706.88]  May our incense rise
[706.88 --> 712.32]  Night before the Lord with me
[712.32 --> 717.60]  Call me songs to stay
[717.60 --> 720.22]  Together
[720.22 --> 726.86]  Lord, provide the Lord with me
[726.86 --> 730.60]  Call me song to sing
[730.60 --> 733.60]  Forever
[733.60 --> 736.60]  To be sincere
[736.60 --> 740.60]  That the Lord is good
[740.60 --> 743.98]  We'll give you everything
[743.98 --> 747.54]  We'll give you everything
[747.54 --> 752.92]  Amen
[752.92 --> 770.12]  Oh Lord my God
[770.12 --> 773.50]  When I'm in awesome wonder
[773.50 --> 780.50]  Consider all the works thy hands have made
[780.50 --> 783.96]  I see the stars
[783.96 --> 787.50]  I hear the rolling thunder
[787.50 --> 790.90]  Thy heart crowned
[790.90 --> 792.22]  The universe
[792.22 --> 794.28]  The universe displayed
[794.28 --> 797.34]  And sings my soul
[797.34 --> 798.96]  My Savior
[798.96 --> 801.28]  Not to be
[801.28 --> 804.28]  How great thou art
[804.28 --> 807.28]  How great thou art
[807.28 --> 810.66]  Then sings my soul
[810.66 --> 812.66]  My Savior
[812.66 --> 813.66]  I see
[813.66 --> 816.66]  How great thou art
[816.66 --> 817.66]  How great thou art
[817.66 --> 819.66]  How great thou art
[819.66 --> 820.66]  How great thou art
[820.66 --> 826.72]  When through the woods
[826.72 --> 828.96]  And the forest fades
[828.96 --> 830.34]  As I wander
[830.34 --> 833.34]  I hear the birds
[833.34 --> 837.34]  Sing sweetly in the trees
[837.34 --> 840.34]  When I look down
[840.34 --> 843.20]  From lofty mountain
[843.20 --> 845.34]  Grand door
[845.34 --> 847.34]  And hear the bright
[847.34 --> 851.34]  And feel the gentle breeze
[851.34 --> 854.72]  And sing my soul
[854.72 --> 856.66]  My Savior
[856.66 --> 857.22]  God
[857.22 --> 858.62]  To be
[858.62 --> 862.86]  How great thou art
[862.86 --> 865.72]  How great thou art
[865.72 --> 868.72]  When sings my soul
[868.72 --> 870.36]  My Savior
[870.36 --> 871.22]  God
[871.22 --> 872.30]  To be
[872.30 --> 876.30]  How great thou art
[876.30 --> 879.58]  How great thou art
[879.58 --> 887.82]  When I shall come, then shall thou vaccination
[887.82 --> 895.50]  And take me home, when joy shall fill my heart
[895.50 --> 901.92]  Then I shall bow in love for an ovation
[901.92 --> 908.58]  And proclaim thy God, the great thou art
[908.58 --> 916.28]  Then sing my song, my secret God, your dear
[916.28 --> 923.46]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[923.46 --> 930.32]  Then sing my song, my secret God, your dear
[930.32 --> 938.02]  How great thou art, how great thou art
[938.02 --> 943.50]  You may be seated
[943.50 --> 961.06]  Our Old Testament reading this morning is from Genesis 50, verses 12 through 24, which is on the screen behind me.
[961.06 --> 965.96]  So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them.
[966.54 --> 979.44]  They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, which Abram had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.
[979.44 --> 988.60]  After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
[988.60 --> 993.58]  When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said,
[994.02 --> 999.04]  What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?
[999.64 --> 1001.70]  So they sent word to Joseph, saying,
[1002.26 --> 1004.50]  Your father left these instructions before he died.
[1005.18 --> 1007.42]  This is what you are to say to Joseph.
[1007.42 --> 1013.66]  I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.
[1014.30 --> 1020.30]  Now, please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.
[1020.84 --> 1023.80]  When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
[1025.02 --> 1028.50]  His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him.
[1029.06 --> 1031.40]  We are your slaves, they said.
[1032.22 --> 1033.60]  But Joseph said to them,
[1033.60 --> 1035.46]  Don't be afraid.
[1036.06 --> 1038.28]  Am I in the place of God?
[1039.16 --> 1040.78]  You intended to harm me,
[1041.22 --> 1047.02]  but God intended it for the good to accomplish what is now done,
[1047.44 --> 1049.04]  the saving of many lives.
[1049.72 --> 1051.76]  So then, don't be afraid.
[1052.34 --> 1055.08]  I will provide for you and your children.
[1055.74 --> 1058.64]  And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
[1060.16 --> 1063.28]  Joseph stayed in Egypt along with all his family,
[1063.28 --> 1065.00]  all his father's family, excuse me.
[1065.60 --> 1070.42]  He lived 110 years and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children.
[1071.42 --> 1074.28]  All the children of Macher, son of Manasseh,
[1074.54 --> 1077.02]  were placed at birth on Joseph's knees.
[1077.88 --> 1079.48]  Then Joseph said to his brothers,
[1080.02 --> 1081.20]  I am about to die,
[1081.82 --> 1083.98]  but God will surely come to your aid
[1083.98 --> 1086.48]  and take you up out of this land
[1086.48 --> 1091.48]  to the promised on the oath of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1091.48 --> 1095.42]  And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said,
[1095.88 --> 1097.64]  God will surely come to your aid
[1097.64 --> 1100.54]  and then you must carry up my bones from this place.
[1100.96 --> 1104.10]  So Joseph died at the age of 110.
[1104.92 --> 1106.42]  And after they embalmed him,
[1106.80 --> 1109.50]  he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
[1110.22 --> 1111.38]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1111.38 --> 1120.70]  Our God invites us to bring our sins before him.
[1121.60 --> 1123.82]  Our confession is not some meager payment
[1123.82 --> 1125.38]  made out for our redemption.
[1126.02 --> 1127.66]  It is a celebration of it.
[1128.38 --> 1130.46]  We bring our brokenness to God
[1130.46 --> 1132.72]  as an offering of praise.
[1133.32 --> 1135.06]  As we read in Psalm 51,
[1135.06 --> 1139.08]  Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,
[1139.74 --> 1142.64]  you who are God my Savior,
[1143.32 --> 1146.06]  and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
[1146.86 --> 1147.98]  Open my lips, Lord,
[1148.16 --> 1150.68]  and my mouth will declare your praise.
[1151.22 --> 1153.08]  You do not delight in sacrifice,
[1153.46 --> 1154.64]  or I would bring it.
[1155.20 --> 1157.80]  You do not take pleasure from burnt offerings.
[1157.80 --> 1160.84]  My sacrifice, O God,
[1161.22 --> 1162.52]  is a broken spirit,
[1163.34 --> 1165.26]  a broken and contrite heart
[1165.26 --> 1168.46]  you, God, will not despise.
[1170.12 --> 1172.54]  Only God has the power to undo
[1172.54 --> 1174.68]  our sin against him
[1174.68 --> 1177.22]  and lift us out of our misery.
[1177.90 --> 1180.32]  This morning we celebrate this amazing gift
[1180.32 --> 1181.46]  that God has given us,
[1181.74 --> 1183.40]  freely and without cost.
[1183.86 --> 1185.52]  We have nothing to offer in return,
[1186.08 --> 1187.70]  nothing but a broken spirit,
[1187.80 --> 1189.22]  let us pray.
[1191.92 --> 1192.94]  Heavenly Father,
[1193.54 --> 1194.36]  in your mercy,
[1194.88 --> 1196.68]  you have released us from bondage.
[1197.82 --> 1198.90]  Maker of the universe,
[1199.74 --> 1201.38]  you bled and died
[1201.38 --> 1203.18]  so that we may live.
[1204.14 --> 1205.60]  We worship you, Lord,
[1205.74 --> 1207.70]  and pour out our thankfulness.
[1209.04 --> 1211.02]  Through the power of your Holy Spirit,
[1211.64 --> 1214.08]  inspire us to live through you
[1214.08 --> 1215.22]  and for you.
[1215.86 --> 1216.10]  Amen.
[1217.80 --> 1219.42]  Let us now sing
[1219.42 --> 1221.38]  How Deep the Father's Love.
[1221.38 --> 1251.36]  How Deep the Father's Love
[1251.36 --> 1254.36]  God's beyond all measure
[1254.36 --> 1260.58]  that he should give his only Son
[1260.58 --> 1265.16]  to make the wretch his treasure.
[1265.16 --> 1271.48]  How great the pain of sealing loss
[1271.48 --> 1272.48]  the Father's love.
[1272.48 --> 1276.70]  The Father turns his face away
[1276.70 --> 1281.48]  as fools which are the chosen one
[1281.48 --> 1287.48]  bring many sons to know him.
[1287.48 --> 1294.48]  Behold the man upon the cross,
[1294.48 --> 1299.18]  Behold the man upon the cross,
[1299.18 --> 1304.52]  My sin upon his shoulders,
[1304.52 --> 1309.92]  The shame to be my all-revised,
[1309.92 --> 1315.42]  The love among the scoffers,
[1315.42 --> 1321.24]  It was my sin that held him there,
[1321.24 --> 1326.70]  Until it was unharmed.
[1326.70 --> 1332.42]  His dying breath has brought me by,
[1332.42 --> 1337.42]  I know that it is finished.
[1337.42 --> 1349.42]  I will not boast in anything,
[1349.42 --> 1354.42]  I will boast about no wisdom,
[1354.42 --> 1360.52]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
[1360.52 --> 1365.52]  His death and resurrection.
[1365.52 --> 1371.52]  Why should I gain from his reward?
[1371.52 --> 1376.52]  I cannot give an answer,
[1376.52 --> 1383.52]  But this I know with all my heart,
[1383.52 --> 1389.52]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[1389.52 --> 1402.52]  My sin upon him,
[1402.52 --> 1404.52]  We read in Luke 23,
[1404.52 --> 1407.34]  two men, two other men, both criminals,
[1407.34 --> 1410.34]  were also led out with him, to be executed.
[1410.34 --> 1412.74]  When they came to the place called the skull,
[1412.74 --> 1419.20]  skull. They were crucified there along with the criminals, one on his right, the other on his left.
[1420.20 --> 1428.06]  Jesus said, Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. And they divided up his
[1428.06 --> 1435.82]  clothes by casting lots. The people stood watching and the rulers even sneered at him. They said,
[1435.82 --> 1442.80]  he saved others. Let him save himself if he is God's Messiah, the chosen one.
[1443.68 --> 1448.30]  Soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar and said,
[1448.72 --> 1455.38]  if you are the king of the Jews, save yourself. There was written on the notice above him, which
[1455.38 --> 1463.26]  read, this is the king of the Jews. One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him.
[1463.26 --> 1471.46]  Aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and us. But the other criminal rebuked him.
[1472.28 --> 1480.26]  Don't you fear God, he said, since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly,
[1480.42 --> 1488.22]  for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong. Then he said,
[1488.22 --> 1496.86]  Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Jesus answered him, truly I tell you,
[1497.28 --> 1505.62]  today you will be with me in paradise. People of God, there is only one who has the power to save.
[1506.38 --> 1512.98]  Before we even walked in the door this morning, we are forgiven. Let us sing of this wonderful mystery.
[1512.98 --> 1516.12]  Come behold this wonderful mystery.
[1516.12 --> 1537.72]  Come behold the wondrous mystery.
[1537.72 --> 1566.88]  come bad refers to building our horses, roads, roads, roads, roads, storms, places, through hell so captured and
[1566.88 --> 1568.88]  so much
[1568.88 --> 1576.88]  Come behold
[1576.88 --> 1578.88]  the wondrous misty
[1579.76 --> 1580.88]  He the perfect
[1581.60 --> 1582.88]  Son of Man
[1583.80 --> 1585.88]  In His living
[1585.88 --> 1588.10]  in His suffering
[1588.10 --> 1590.20]  Never trace
[1590.20 --> 1592.72]  nor stain of sin
[1592.72 --> 1594.88]  See the true
[1594.88 --> 1596.88]  and better Adam
[1597.44 --> 1598.88]  Come to save
[1599.66 --> 1600.88]  the hope of man
[1601.96 --> 1603.96]  Christ the great
[1603.96 --> 1606.26]  and sure fulfillment
[1606.26 --> 1608.66]  of the law
[1608.66 --> 1610.88]  in Him we stand
[1611.40 --> 1620.16]  Come behold
[1620.16 --> 1622.80]  the wondrous misty
[1622.80 --> 1624.68]  Christ the Lord
[1624.68 --> 1626.68]  upon the tree
[1626.68 --> 1628.68]  In the stead
[1628.68 --> 1630.68]  of the sin
[1630.68 --> 1632.68]  brings the lamp
[1632.68 --> 1634.68]  in victory
[1634.68 --> 1636.68]  See the price
[1636.68 --> 1639.68]  of our redemption
[1639.68 --> 1641.68]  See the Father's
[1641.68 --> 1643.68]  blood on fire
[1643.68 --> 1644.68]  The stone
[1644.68 --> 1645.68]  and sea
[1645.68 --> 1646.70]  of my heart
[1658.82 --> 1659.60]  we
[1659.60 --> 1659.68] ņ Jesus
[1659.68 --> 1663.46]  bek
[1663.46 --> 1665.94]  The wondrous mystery,
[1666.34 --> 1670.34]  Seen the death of God of life,
[1670.76 --> 1674.64]  But no grateful, very strained,
[1674.98 --> 1679.56]  Praise the Lord, He is the light.
[1679.56 --> 1684.34]  What a forty-some delusions,
[1684.80 --> 1688.98]  How unwavering our home,
[1688.98 --> 1693.56]  Praise Him, Father, Resurrected,
[1693.96 --> 1698.30]  As we will be when He comes,
[1698.30 --> 1702.30]  For the Lord is the deliverance,
[1703.30 --> 1708.30]  How unwavering our home,
[1710.16 --> 1714.58]  Praise Him, Father, Resurrected,
[1714.58 --> 1720.74]  As we will be when He comes.
[1734.74 --> 1737.76]  So the children are now dismissed to go to their classes.
[1744.58 --> 1755.18]  So, I don't know if,
[1755.60 --> 1756.44]  If you were here last week,
[1756.50 --> 1757.46]  Kind of at the end of the service,
[1757.54 --> 1758.56]  I started to lose my voice,
[1758.56 --> 1760.62]  And I kind of struggled with it all week.
[1760.80 --> 1762.06]  I was really worried about today.
[1763.40 --> 1765.16]  So I have a Ricola in my mouth.
[1765.28 --> 1766.86]  So if you hear a clicking sound,
[1767.04 --> 1769.78]  I apologize not to be, you know, gross.
[1770.76 --> 1773.10]  Also, I'm not going to get too worked up.
[1773.10 --> 1775.56]  Because I might throw out my voice.
[1775.70 --> 1780.50]  So I'm going to trust the microphone will maybe even be turned up and carry my voice.
[1780.68 --> 1786.58]  And I'm just going to speak calmly and let the Holy Spirit do His work.
[1788.96 --> 1792.28]  Okay, so let's turn to Romans chapter 8.
[1792.54 --> 1796.26]  We have the privilege of continuing in the book of Romans this morning.
[1796.26 --> 1804.26]  So actually, second to last message in Romans chapter 8.
[1804.34 --> 1808.12]  We'll look at this today, verses 28 to 30.
[1808.26 --> 1810.36]  Then we'll finish off the rest of the chapter next week.
[1811.06 --> 1812.32]  And then we'll be into Advent.
[1815.32 --> 1818.70]  So today though, we will look at verses 28 to 30.
[1818.70 --> 1823.96]  Okay, so let's give our attention to God's word.
[1823.96 --> 1852.00]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1852.00 --> 1857.62]  So would you join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon His word,
[1857.72 --> 1863.82]  as we come before it to hear what He would have to say to us at church this morning.
[1864.20 --> 1864.82]  Let's pray.
[1866.06 --> 1871.08]  Heavenly Father, we thank You for every word that You speak.
[1871.16 --> 1874.44]  We thank You for every truth that comes from the Bible.
[1874.44 --> 1882.56]  But we thank You especially for those truths that come to us like a bolt of lightning into our souls.
[1883.16 --> 1892.40]  That leave us changed and that stir us and that move us and that give us a real spirit of thankfulness and joy.
[1893.38 --> 1896.72]  We pray that these words may be just that to us this day.
[1897.28 --> 1901.64]  Lord, as You reveal to us the loving plan that You have for each of us in Christ.
[1901.64 --> 1905.66]  We pray for Your Holy Spirit now to be at work in our hearts.
[1906.88 --> 1909.22]  And we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1909.22 --> 1916.48]  What do you like to listen to when you go driving in your car?
[1918.20 --> 1919.42]  What do you like to listen to?
[1920.18 --> 1921.94]  Sometimes it's nice not to listen to anything.
[1923.14 --> 1925.92]  Well, sometimes I like to listen to different things.
[1926.04 --> 1927.08]  Sometimes music.
[1927.48 --> 1928.40]  I like to listen to music.
[1928.64 --> 1931.20]  But more, I like to listen to sermons.
[1931.20 --> 1931.68]  Yes.
[1932.12 --> 1934.26]  I enjoy listening to other people preach.
[1934.56 --> 1936.82]  And I like podcasts on different topics.
[1937.50 --> 1938.38]  Mostly theology.
[1939.74 --> 1945.86]  But now whenever I'm driving with my family, I don't make them listen to sermons or podcasts.
[1945.86 --> 1949.58]  Unless I'm with just my son John and we listen to a history podcast together.
[1950.28 --> 1951.22]  John is a history buff.
[1951.22 --> 1956.56]  But usually, you know, with the kids, the family in the car, we listen to the radio.
[1957.52 --> 1966.44]  And a few years ago, there was a song that was being played quite a lot on all the rock, pop, top hits kind of stations.
[1966.94 --> 1971.74]  And it's a song by a band called the Swedish House Mafia.
[1971.74 --> 1977.32]  And there, his song was called Don't You Worry, Child.
[1978.88 --> 1979.24]  Anybody?
[1979.68 --> 1979.98]  Anybody?
[1980.76 --> 1980.96]  No.
[1981.14 --> 1981.38]  Okay.
[1981.44 --> 1982.08]  Don't You Worry, Child.
[1982.14 --> 1985.42]  This is a ton of airplay, at least on the kind of the popular radio.
[1986.78 --> 1995.96]  Now, the song is about a boy whose heart was broken by a girl in a house across a blue lake, as the lyrics tell us.
[1996.80 --> 2001.06]  And because of this heartbreak, this boy, he needs consolation.
[2001.06 --> 2002.10]  He needs encouragement.
[2003.20 --> 2007.46]  And so the chorus of the song is his father telling him this.
[2008.64 --> 2009.66]  Don't you worry.
[2010.02 --> 2011.22]  Don't you worry, child.
[2012.14 --> 2014.12]  See, heaven's got a plan for you.
[2016.34 --> 2027.12]  And so besides the catchy song, besides the great beat, I think that one of the reasons why this song is so popular is because of this message in this chorus.
[2027.12 --> 2028.54]  Don't you worry, child.
[2028.68 --> 2030.06]  Heaven's got a plan for you.
[2031.06 --> 2034.64]  Because do we not all want that to be true?
[2036.02 --> 2036.12]  Right?
[2036.18 --> 2044.76]  Do we not all want to know that our sickness, our broken relationships, all of the things that causes heartache and pain in this world,
[2045.10 --> 2048.80]  do we not want to know that there is something working for us?
[2049.36 --> 2049.66]  Right?
[2049.66 --> 2052.80]  That there is a plan for all of us.
[2054.56 --> 2059.26]  Well, as we come to our text today in Romans chapter 8, it tells us just that.
[2059.90 --> 2061.32]  That God is working.
[2061.44 --> 2067.48]  That God is actually orchestrating the universe to accomplish his plan for you.
[2067.48 --> 2081.42]  And I'm sure that for many of us, Romans chapter 8, verse 28, is a, not only a well-known passage, but a well-loved passage in our lives.
[2081.42 --> 2092.62]  And similar to the song, but in a much greater way, this passage, it gives us a message of consolation and hope from our Heavenly Father.
[2092.62 --> 2096.94]  And it comes in the context, though, of suffering.
[2097.86 --> 2100.24]  That's the greater context of this verse.
[2101.04 --> 2108.22]  And Paul, throughout Romans chapter 8, has been showing us all that flows from being in Christ.
[2109.10 --> 2109.26]  Right?
[2109.26 --> 2111.92]  All that we enjoy as God's people.
[2112.40 --> 2117.54]  So he begins, chapter 8, verse 1, we are free from condemnation.
[2118.20 --> 2121.56]  And then he goes on, that we have been adopted as daughters and sons of God.
[2122.16 --> 2124.84]  That we have the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[2125.00 --> 2127.28]  And we have a guarantee of glory to come.
[2127.60 --> 2130.84]  All of these things that flow from our life in Christ.
[2130.84 --> 2144.64]  But in the meantime, while we await glory, Paul has also been honest that even though we are in Christ, life lived in this age, this present age, is hard.
[2146.26 --> 2152.94]  As we await all that is to come in the fullness of our inheritance, we live in an age of groaning.
[2153.60 --> 2155.92]  That's the word that we've seen three times in Romans 8.
[2156.28 --> 2159.90]  And Paul has talked about how we as Christians, we groan in our suffering.
[2159.90 --> 2166.16]  And actually how all of creation is groaning in its frustration that it has been subjected to.
[2167.18 --> 2174.82]  So in other words, as we read verse 28, it is set in the real world.
[2175.70 --> 2175.94]  Right?
[2175.98 --> 2183.58]  We live in a real world of tears and of pain and of heartache and of longing as we wait for glory.
[2183.58 --> 2193.56]  And because we live in this age of groaning, what we have in our passage today is a huge promise that God gives us.
[2194.30 --> 2202.02]  And it's a promise God gives us in order to help us, to sustain us as we go through this life.
[2202.02 --> 2210.34]  And so our good Heavenly Father, He gives us these words of consolation that He has a plan for everything that happens.
[2211.30 --> 2219.44]  And it's a promise that will sustain us no matter what heartbreak we face, whether it's a breakup with a girl or anything else we face in this life.
[2219.44 --> 2227.38]  And the thing is, though, we have to take these words and we have to believe every word that God gives to us.
[2228.18 --> 2229.16]  So it's not so hard.
[2229.24 --> 2231.36]  This is a very easy verse to understand.
[2231.36 --> 2237.06]  But it is much harder to believe it and to believe it deeply.
[2239.28 --> 2246.86]  So let's look at this promise that God gives to us here, especially in verse 28, but also, you know, we'll be looking at verses 29 and 30 as well.
[2247.10 --> 2249.00]  But we're going to focus here first on verse 28.
[2249.76 --> 2252.74]  He begins by saying, and we know.
[2253.70 --> 2254.72]  Let's pause there.
[2255.24 --> 2256.02]  And we know.
[2256.90 --> 2258.62]  There is something that we know.
[2258.62 --> 2263.22]  Now, there are lots of things we don't know.
[2264.04 --> 2265.72]  Okay, I feel that way all the time.
[2267.38 --> 2272.46]  Paul has already told us in verse 26 that we don't know how to pray as we ought.
[2273.82 --> 2274.02]  Right?
[2274.20 --> 2275.14]  It's something we don't know.
[2275.26 --> 2278.68]  We don't know what God's plan is for us going forward.
[2278.78 --> 2281.28]  We don't know how to pray for ourselves or for others.
[2282.06 --> 2283.86]  We don't know what to pray for.
[2283.86 --> 2290.32]  But verse 28 tells us that there are some things that God has given for us to know.
[2290.32 --> 2297.64]  And what God has given for us to know will be enough to help us cope with all the things that we don't know.
[2298.52 --> 2300.50]  There's some things that we just don't know.
[2300.80 --> 2302.92]  But there are some promises that we do know.
[2304.52 --> 2306.42]  Now, there's a wonderful old hymn.
[2307.26 --> 2309.06]  You know, as we, you know, I prepare a sermon.
[2309.26 --> 2312.64]  I talk with, you know, Ashley this week about what song should we sing after the sermon.
[2312.80 --> 2314.26]  We throw out different ideas.
[2314.26 --> 2317.94]  So I get to kind of discover a lot of different hymns and stuff.
[2318.04 --> 2319.90]  One of them was an old hymn.
[2320.00 --> 2321.30]  It's called I Cannot Tell.
[2321.80 --> 2322.48]  I Cannot Tell.
[2324.04 --> 2327.44]  And each of the verses begins with the words,
[2327.62 --> 2328.72]  I cannot tell.
[2329.62 --> 2330.40]  And then it goes on.
[2330.88 --> 2333.46]  But then it moves to, but this I know.
[2334.34 --> 2336.22]  I cannot tell, but this I know.
[2336.36 --> 2338.66]  So let me read a couple lines from this hymn.
[2338.66 --> 2340.66]  One verse says this.
[2341.20 --> 2345.40]  I cannot tell how silently he suffered, Jesus.
[2346.24 --> 2350.06]  As with his peace, he graced this place of tears.
[2351.10 --> 2351.78]  And then it goes on.
[2351.96 --> 2353.00]  But this I know.
[2353.78 --> 2355.88]  He heals the brokenhearted.
[2357.40 --> 2361.46]  And stays our sin and calms our lurking fears.
[2362.90 --> 2364.54]  So then here's one more verse.
[2364.54 --> 2369.06]  It says, I cannot tell how he will win the nations,
[2369.74 --> 2372.60]  how he will claim his earthly heritage.
[2373.24 --> 2374.56]  But this I know.
[2375.52 --> 2378.26]  All flesh shall see his glory.
[2379.24 --> 2382.12]  And he shall reap the harvest he has sown.
[2383.08 --> 2383.34]  Right?
[2383.40 --> 2384.52]  I think it's a beautiful song.
[2385.08 --> 2386.52]  And I love the shape of it.
[2387.18 --> 2389.52]  I cannot tell, but this I know.
[2389.80 --> 2390.84]  Some things we don't know.
[2391.58 --> 2392.42]  Some things we do know.
[2392.42 --> 2396.78]  And so think about what you don't know this morning.
[2399.28 --> 2402.26]  We don't know what tomorrow brings.
[2402.70 --> 2402.86]  Right?
[2403.08 --> 2403.86]  The Bible says that.
[2404.22 --> 2407.42]  We don't know what's coming in the months ahead.
[2407.58 --> 2410.50]  We don't know if we're going to have good health or bad health.
[2411.50 --> 2416.94]  We don't know in the coming months if we will be at peace or in torment.
[2416.94 --> 2422.44]  So we mustn't think that we know more than we do.
[2423.10 --> 2427.30]  But we also must think that we know less than we do.
[2428.00 --> 2430.06]  And we know Romans 8.28.
[2431.02 --> 2433.14]  Paul says, and we know,
[2433.94 --> 2436.86]  that in all things God works for the good of those who love him.
[2437.08 --> 2438.70]  Who have been called according to his purpose.
[2438.84 --> 2439.38]  We know that.
[2439.38 --> 2442.64]  God wants us to know that.
[2443.74 --> 2448.78]  And so often what we most need in life is not more information or new information,
[2448.78 --> 2451.04]  but to remember what we already know.
[2453.04 --> 2456.64]  Now, as we continue, the verse goes on and it says,
[2456.78 --> 2461.70]  and we know that in all things God works for the good.
[2462.24 --> 2462.88]  Let's pause there.
[2462.88 --> 2469.96]  And so we need to be really, really clear on what this is promising
[2469.96 --> 2471.54]  and what this is not promising.
[2472.00 --> 2474.40]  What it is saying and what it is not saying.
[2475.50 --> 2479.38]  Paul is not saying that all things are good.
[2480.48 --> 2481.78]  That's not what this verse says.
[2482.62 --> 2484.74]  God never says, as soon as you become a Christian,
[2485.30 --> 2487.34]  that bad things stop happening to you.
[2488.22 --> 2488.36]  Right?
[2488.42 --> 2492.16]  And actually the Bible tells us and experience confirms that is not so.
[2492.88 --> 2493.42]  Right?
[2493.48 --> 2495.16]  We still experience bad things.
[2495.44 --> 2497.50]  Christians suffer like anyone else suffers.
[2498.30 --> 2498.56]  Right?
[2498.60 --> 2499.64]  We get the same illnesses.
[2500.30 --> 2500.92]  Case in point.
[2502.88 --> 2505.10]  We face the same financial challenges.
[2506.10 --> 2508.46]  We go through the same bereavements.
[2509.60 --> 2511.28]  The same stresses at work.
[2511.28 --> 2513.42]  The same difficulties in relationships.
[2514.10 --> 2518.84]  The same accidents and tragedies that everyone faces.
[2519.08 --> 2520.10]  And on top of that,
[2520.10 --> 2523.34]  Christians sometimes suffer more for being Christians
[2523.34 --> 2525.98]  because of Christ.
[2527.18 --> 2528.52]  You know, in many parts of the world today,
[2528.66 --> 2529.98]  Christians lose their jobs
[2529.98 --> 2532.54]  or are disowned by their families
[2532.54 --> 2533.94]  or thrown into prison
[2533.94 --> 2536.36]  or even killed because of their faith in Jesus.
[2538.22 --> 2540.42]  So Paul is not saying all things are good.
[2541.56 --> 2544.70]  He's saying all things work for good.
[2544.70 --> 2549.06]  Evil and sin and suffering are real.
[2549.86 --> 2554.62]  And yet, God can still bring about his good purposes.
[2556.36 --> 2559.62]  Thomas Watson, an English Puritan, says it this way.
[2559.96 --> 2560.40]  He says,
[2560.54 --> 2563.82]  God can draw straight lines with crooked sticks.
[2564.90 --> 2565.42]  I like that.
[2565.74 --> 2568.62]  God can draw straight lines with crooked sticks.
[2568.62 --> 2570.90]  That's what's being said here.
[2571.90 --> 2574.64]  And now, you know what else is going to make a world of difference
[2574.64 --> 2576.88]  is when we notice that word,
[2577.42 --> 2578.16]  all things.
[2578.36 --> 2578.64]  All.
[2579.96 --> 2580.18]  Right?
[2580.28 --> 2580.88]  Paul is saying,
[2581.38 --> 2583.84]  in all things,
[2584.20 --> 2585.00]  God works for good.
[2585.22 --> 2586.70]  Now, that is very significant
[2586.70 --> 2588.34]  because imagine this.
[2588.44 --> 2589.38]  Imagine if Paul said,
[2589.70 --> 2589.96]  you know,
[2590.08 --> 2591.46]  in some things,
[2592.16 --> 2593.56]  even in most things,
[2594.56 --> 2596.08]  God works for good.
[2596.08 --> 2597.60]  Would that give us any comfort at all?
[2598.62 --> 2599.48]  That would not give us,
[2599.60 --> 2601.18]  I wouldn't think that would give us much comfort
[2601.18 --> 2603.32]  because we'd always be wondering,
[2603.48 --> 2606.18]  well, am I in the some things zone
[2606.18 --> 2608.00]  or am I outside of it?
[2608.66 --> 2610.18]  Or even if this verse said,
[2610.32 --> 2613.56]  in 99.9% of all things,
[2614.16 --> 2615.06]  God works for good.
[2616.04 --> 2616.96]  What would we do?
[2617.06 --> 2617.44]  We still,
[2617.60 --> 2618.52]  we're going through something
[2618.52 --> 2619.34]  and we say,
[2619.46 --> 2619.68]  well,
[2620.22 --> 2623.70]  what is happening to me
[2623.70 --> 2625.40]  must be in that 0.1%
[2625.40 --> 2627.56]  because I really can't see
[2627.56 --> 2628.52]  how anything good
[2628.52 --> 2629.84]  is possibly going to come of this.
[2631.76 --> 2632.76]  That's not what it says.
[2633.02 --> 2633.62]  It says,
[2634.06 --> 2636.32]  in all things.
[2636.96 --> 2638.60]  And unless we have good reason
[2638.60 --> 2640.26]  to limit all things,
[2640.68 --> 2642.08]  which we don't,
[2642.56 --> 2643.84]  it seems safe to say
[2643.84 --> 2646.54]  that all things includes
[2646.54 --> 2649.18]  all things.
[2649.26 --> 2650.38]  And all things means
[2650.38 --> 2652.16]  everything.
[2652.16 --> 2654.40]  good exegesis.
[2655.50 --> 2656.76]  We're interpreters.
[2657.44 --> 2658.90]  All things means all things,
[2659.30 --> 2659.74]  basically.
[2660.62 --> 2661.74]  And I would even suggest,
[2661.88 --> 2662.08]  though,
[2662.82 --> 2664.58]  that because of the context
[2664.58 --> 2665.28]  of Romans 8
[2665.28 --> 2666.40]  where Paul has been talking
[2666.40 --> 2667.16]  about suffering,
[2667.88 --> 2669.44]  I think that's actually
[2669.44 --> 2670.34]  what he has
[2670.34 --> 2671.94]  particularly in mind.
[2673.42 --> 2674.72]  God is able to take
[2674.72 --> 2675.36]  all things,
[2675.50 --> 2676.54]  even and perhaps
[2676.54 --> 2678.86]  especially bad things,
[2678.86 --> 2681.34]  and he's able to use them
[2681.34 --> 2682.02]  for our good.
[2683.78 --> 2685.20]  And the most remarkable
[2685.20 --> 2687.00]  illustration of this
[2687.00 --> 2688.00]  comes from the story
[2688.00 --> 2688.46]  of Joseph.
[2689.66 --> 2689.88]  Right?
[2690.00 --> 2691.12]  We read it earlier
[2691.12 --> 2693.12]  because Joseph
[2693.12 --> 2695.50]  had some very bad things
[2695.50 --> 2696.26]  happen to him.
[2696.74 --> 2697.46]  Joseph was sold
[2697.46 --> 2698.20]  by his brothers
[2698.20 --> 2699.08]  into slavery.
[2700.36 --> 2700.50]  Okay,
[2700.52 --> 2702.22]  that is an unquestionable evil.
[2702.40 --> 2703.04]  Imagine that.
[2703.52 --> 2704.38]  Your brother
[2704.38 --> 2705.86]  selling you
[2705.86 --> 2706.86]  into slavery
[2706.86 --> 2708.08]  and then telling your dad
[2708.08 --> 2709.94]  that a wild animal
[2709.94 --> 2710.38]  ate you.
[2711.60 --> 2711.76]  Okay,
[2711.78 --> 2712.76]  that's pretty messed up.
[2714.72 --> 2715.24]  Then,
[2715.46 --> 2717.32]  so he's exiled to Egypt.
[2718.14 --> 2719.78]  He is falsely accused.
[2719.88 --> 2721.18]  He is wrongly jailed.
[2721.98 --> 2722.58]  All these things
[2722.58 --> 2723.20]  happen to him
[2723.20 --> 2723.82]  and yet many,
[2723.96 --> 2724.56]  many years later
[2724.56 --> 2725.56]  he comes to power.
[2726.14 --> 2727.14]  He ends up leading
[2727.14 --> 2728.04]  a campaign
[2728.04 --> 2729.16]  that saves thousands
[2729.16 --> 2730.28]  if not tens
[2730.28 --> 2731.32]  or hundreds of thousands
[2731.32 --> 2731.88]  of lives
[2731.88 --> 2732.70]  including
[2732.70 --> 2734.24]  his brothers
[2734.24 --> 2735.40]  saving them
[2735.40 --> 2736.10]  from starvation.
[2736.86 --> 2737.74]  and his brothers
[2737.74 --> 2738.62]  they come to meet him
[2738.62 --> 2739.64]  and he has,
[2740.12 --> 2740.28]  he,
[2740.46 --> 2740.66]  Joseph,
[2740.74 --> 2741.52]  has all this power
[2741.52 --> 2741.94]  over them
[2741.94 --> 2742.70]  and their lives
[2742.70 --> 2744.14]  are in his hands.
[2745.38 --> 2746.26]  And he has something
[2746.26 --> 2746.90]  very important
[2746.90 --> 2747.76]  to tell his brothers.
[2748.92 --> 2749.62]  He says,
[2749.84 --> 2750.82]  after all the evil
[2750.82 --> 2752.88]  that they have done,
[2753.02 --> 2753.36]  he says,
[2753.46 --> 2754.08]  you my brothers,
[2754.28 --> 2755.40]  you intended it for evil
[2755.40 --> 2757.38]  but God intended it
[2757.38 --> 2757.74]  for good.
[2758.60 --> 2760.26]  So you have this one act,
[2760.32 --> 2761.06]  an evil act,
[2761.18 --> 2762.16]  not saying it's a good act,
[2762.20 --> 2762.96]  it's an evil act
[2762.96 --> 2763.86]  but there are two
[2763.86 --> 2765.40]  intentions behind it.
[2765.40 --> 2767.04]  There is the intentions
[2767.04 --> 2767.96]  of the brothers
[2767.96 --> 2768.82]  which was for evil
[2768.82 --> 2770.32]  but God's intentions
[2770.32 --> 2771.80]  is for good.
[2772.94 --> 2773.08]  You know,
[2773.16 --> 2774.74]  and we see this
[2774.74 --> 2777.00]  most ultimately
[2777.00 --> 2778.88]  in the death of Jesus.
[2779.52 --> 2779.72]  Right?
[2779.78 --> 2780.08]  Don't we?
[2780.74 --> 2780.94]  Right?
[2781.00 --> 2782.50]  The most wicked thing
[2782.50 --> 2783.98]  that has ever happened
[2783.98 --> 2784.80]  on this planet
[2784.80 --> 2785.70]  when we put
[2785.70 --> 2786.54]  the Son of God
[2786.54 --> 2787.12]  to death.
[2788.64 --> 2789.30]  You know,
[2789.36 --> 2790.20]  on that day
[2790.20 --> 2792.22]  that Jesus Christ
[2792.22 --> 2792.86]  was crucified,
[2793.16 --> 2794.16]  all of his friends,
[2794.16 --> 2795.58]  what were they thinking?
[2796.68 --> 2797.70]  That Jesus is hanging
[2797.70 --> 2798.24]  on the cross
[2798.24 --> 2799.18]  and they're saying,
[2799.66 --> 2800.64]  I can't believe this.
[2801.52 --> 2802.30]  I can't believe
[2802.30 --> 2802.92]  this is happening.
[2803.50 --> 2803.62]  Right?
[2803.90 --> 2804.26]  Jesus,
[2804.38 --> 2805.10]  all the good things
[2805.10 --> 2805.82]  that he's done,
[2806.38 --> 2808.20]  all of the people
[2808.20 --> 2809.48]  that he's healed,
[2809.60 --> 2810.82]  the lives that he has changed,
[2810.90 --> 2811.88]  our hope that he was
[2811.88 --> 2812.44]  the Messiah
[2812.44 --> 2813.86]  and now all these
[2813.86 --> 2814.66]  trumped up charges
[2814.66 --> 2815.40]  against him
[2815.40 --> 2816.76]  and he's powerless
[2816.76 --> 2817.92]  and I can't believe
[2817.92 --> 2818.60]  this is happening.
[2820.08 --> 2821.22]  And you would have said,
[2821.32 --> 2821.80]  I can't believe
[2821.80 --> 2822.54]  that God could do
[2822.54 --> 2823.20]  anything good
[2823.20 --> 2823.74]  out of this.
[2824.90 --> 2826.60]  What could God
[2826.60 --> 2828.82]  possibly bring
[2828.82 --> 2830.04]  of goodness
[2830.04 --> 2831.92]  out of the crucifixion?
[2832.84 --> 2833.44]  And yet,
[2833.74 --> 2834.94]  through the most evil
[2834.94 --> 2836.20]  human act in history,
[2836.34 --> 2837.02]  God purposed
[2837.02 --> 2838.42]  the most extraordinary good.
[2839.50 --> 2839.62]  Right?
[2839.64 --> 2840.08]  The redemption
[2840.08 --> 2840.88]  of the world,
[2841.16 --> 2841.68]  the forgiveness
[2841.68 --> 2842.50]  of our sins,
[2842.88 --> 2843.42]  the triumph
[2843.42 --> 2844.56]  over death itself.
[2846.54 --> 2847.86]  And so we can say,
[2847.96 --> 2848.44]  we know that
[2848.44 --> 2849.44]  in all things,
[2849.82 --> 2850.78]  God works for the good
[2850.78 --> 2851.54]  of those who love him.
[2851.54 --> 2854.32]  God can use suffering.
[2854.70 --> 2856.32]  God can use family dysfunction.
[2856.80 --> 2858.16]  He can use enslavement.
[2858.48 --> 2859.60]  He can use famines.
[2860.40 --> 2861.40]  That doesn't mean
[2861.40 --> 2862.88]  we like evil people
[2862.88 --> 2863.96]  doing evil things,
[2863.96 --> 2864.92]  but it does mean
[2864.92 --> 2865.72]  we can rejoice
[2865.72 --> 2866.38]  in all things
[2866.38 --> 2867.00]  because we know
[2867.00 --> 2867.46]  that God
[2867.46 --> 2868.42]  is accomplishing
[2868.42 --> 2869.10]  his good
[2869.10 --> 2869.90]  through them.
[2870.98 --> 2871.94]  So that really
[2871.94 --> 2872.88]  just now begs
[2872.88 --> 2873.44]  the question,
[2873.82 --> 2875.08]  what is the good?
[2876.28 --> 2876.48]  Right?
[2876.48 --> 2877.14]  what good
[2877.14 --> 2878.18]  does God bring about
[2878.18 --> 2878.92]  in our lives?
[2880.78 --> 2881.14]  Well,
[2881.18 --> 2882.04]  the answer comes
[2882.04 --> 2882.88]  in verse 29.
[2893.72 --> 2894.08]  Okay.
[2894.26 --> 2894.74]  I don't have enough
[2894.74 --> 2895.40]  to share with everybody
[2895.40 --> 2895.92]  in the class.
[2896.32 --> 2896.68]  Sorry.
[2897.82 --> 2898.18]  Okay.
[2900.02 --> 2900.98]  Answer is in verse 29.
[2901.34 --> 2901.72]  Here we go.
[2901.80 --> 2902.64]  Let me read it for us.
[2902.64 --> 2905.16]  For those God foreknew,
[2905.84 --> 2907.22]  he also predestined
[2907.22 --> 2908.14]  to be conformed
[2908.14 --> 2908.66]  to the image
[2908.66 --> 2909.26]  of his son,
[2909.60 --> 2910.46]  that he might be
[2910.46 --> 2911.18]  the firstborn
[2911.18 --> 2912.78]  among many brothers
[2912.78 --> 2913.68]  and sisters.
[2914.64 --> 2914.92]  Okay.
[2914.98 --> 2915.88]  So what we need to notice
[2915.88 --> 2916.66]  here in verse 29,
[2916.80 --> 2917.46]  there's a lot here,
[2917.96 --> 2919.22]  but here's the main point.
[2919.86 --> 2920.88]  It's that God's end goal
[2920.88 --> 2921.56]  for us
[2921.56 --> 2923.08]  is that we would be conformed
[2923.08 --> 2923.56]  to the image
[2923.56 --> 2924.20]  of his son.
[2925.64 --> 2927.70]  And that word conformed,
[2927.74 --> 2929.74]  it means to be shaped into.
[2929.74 --> 2932.14]  And the Bible often uses
[2932.14 --> 2932.82]  this imagery
[2932.82 --> 2934.22]  of a potter
[2934.22 --> 2936.02]  who has a lump of clay.
[2937.16 --> 2937.28]  Right?
[2937.32 --> 2938.06]  And so the potter,
[2938.12 --> 2939.00]  you got this lump of clay
[2939.00 --> 2939.60]  and the potter
[2939.60 --> 2941.16]  has predestined
[2941.16 --> 2942.78]  that this lump of clay
[2942.78 --> 2943.38]  will become
[2943.38 --> 2944.40]  a beautiful vase.
[2946.42 --> 2947.44]  And to accomplish
[2947.44 --> 2948.34]  that purpose,
[2948.66 --> 2949.74]  if you've seen
[2949.74 --> 2950.68]  a potter work,
[2950.84 --> 2950.98]  right,
[2951.02 --> 2952.10]  they take that lump of clay
[2952.10 --> 2953.00]  and they put it on the wheel
[2953.00 --> 2955.06]  and they begin to shape it
[2955.06 --> 2956.50]  and they cut it
[2956.50 --> 2957.76]  and they pinch it
[2957.76 --> 2958.72]  and they smooth it
[2958.72 --> 2960.42]  and whatever else potters do
[2960.42 --> 2962.12]  to take a lump of clay
[2962.12 --> 2963.16]  and to shape it
[2963.16 --> 2964.24]  into its desired
[2964.24 --> 2965.40]  predestined end.
[2966.22 --> 2966.80]  And Paul is saying
[2966.80 --> 2967.56]  if you are a Christian,
[2967.76 --> 2970.68]  God has a predestined
[2970.68 --> 2972.24]  end for you
[2972.24 --> 2973.06]  and that is that
[2973.06 --> 2974.24]  you would look like Jesus.
[2975.56 --> 2976.80]  So God is polishing
[2976.80 --> 2978.16]  and he is shaping
[2978.16 --> 2979.26]  and he is molding
[2979.26 --> 2982.14]  and using all the circumstances
[2982.14 --> 2983.22]  of your life
[2983.22 --> 2984.44]  to that end.
[2985.76 --> 2987.26]  And that is how God
[2987.26 --> 2988.48]  defines the good.
[2989.72 --> 2990.22]  In fact,
[2990.28 --> 2991.30]  there is nothing better
[2991.30 --> 2992.50]  that God could do for you
[2992.50 --> 2993.06]  than to make you
[2993.06 --> 2994.10]  more like Jesus Christ.
[2994.84 --> 2995.56]  Do you realize that?
[2997.22 --> 2999.02]  Of all the good things
[2999.02 --> 3000.48]  that we could ask God for
[3000.48 --> 3001.62]  or that we could want,
[3001.76 --> 3002.94]  the very best thing
[3002.94 --> 3004.32]  that God could ever give us
[3004.32 --> 3005.48]  is that we
[3005.48 --> 3006.76]  would become more like
[3006.76 --> 3007.52]  Jesus Christ.
[3008.96 --> 3010.32]  So I think what we need to do
[3010.32 --> 3011.52]  is redefine
[3011.52 --> 3012.88]  in our own minds
[3012.88 --> 3013.30]  and hearts
[3013.30 --> 3014.24]  what is good.
[3015.12 --> 3016.66]  God's idea of our good
[3016.66 --> 3017.30]  is not
[3017.30 --> 3018.46]  that we will be rich
[3018.46 --> 3020.98]  or that we will be happy
[3020.98 --> 3023.08]  or that we will be successful
[3023.08 --> 3024.12]  or popular
[3024.12 --> 3026.36]  but that we would become
[3026.36 --> 3027.24]  like Jesus Christ.
[3028.82 --> 3030.38]  So that is what God is using
[3030.38 --> 3031.32]  all of the powers
[3031.32 --> 3032.06]  of his goodness,
[3032.22 --> 3032.92]  of his wisdom
[3032.92 --> 3034.12]  to orchestrate
[3034.12 --> 3034.80]  in your life.
[3036.80 --> 3037.92]  And that is what God
[3037.92 --> 3039.88]  most prizes for you.
[3040.12 --> 3040.52]  So therefore,
[3040.64 --> 3041.22]  that's what we should
[3041.22 --> 3041.86]  most prize.
[3041.86 --> 3044.92]  We should look at
[3044.92 --> 3045.50]  our own lives
[3045.50 --> 3045.88]  and say,
[3046.14 --> 3047.00]  what God is doing
[3047.00 --> 3047.98]  is to make us
[3047.98 --> 3048.68]  like Christ
[3048.68 --> 3049.40]  and I'm going to
[3049.40 --> 3050.44]  participate in that
[3050.44 --> 3051.32]  and I'm going to also
[3051.32 --> 3052.10]  direct the course
[3052.10 --> 3052.76]  of my life
[3052.76 --> 3053.94]  that I would
[3053.94 --> 3054.86]  become more like
[3054.86 --> 3055.56]  Jesus Christ
[3055.56 --> 3056.60]  as I cooperate
[3056.60 --> 3057.48]  with the Holy Spirit
[3057.48 --> 3058.44]  at work within me.
[3060.52 --> 3061.38]  So now Paul
[3061.38 --> 3064.76]  finishes his point
[3064.76 --> 3066.16]  up in verse 30
[3066.16 --> 3068.34]  by taking us
[3068.34 --> 3070.66]  to this 50,000 foot view
[3070.66 --> 3072.24]  and giving us
[3072.24 --> 3073.20]  a perspective
[3073.20 --> 3074.46]  of God's view of things.
[3075.06 --> 3075.98]  So verse 30,
[3076.94 --> 3078.64]  and those he predestined
[3078.64 --> 3079.66]  he also called,
[3080.00 --> 3080.72]  those he called
[3080.72 --> 3081.58]  he also justified,
[3081.78 --> 3082.54]  those he justified
[3082.54 --> 3084.04]  he also glorified.
[3085.08 --> 3086.32]  Now this verse
[3086.32 --> 3087.42]  is often called
[3087.42 --> 3088.32]  the golden chain
[3088.32 --> 3088.96]  of salvation.
[3089.98 --> 3090.88]  We could do
[3090.88 --> 3091.84]  a whole different sermon
[3091.84 --> 3092.46]  on this one.
[3093.50 --> 3094.66]  I have restrained myself.
[3094.66 --> 3097.24]  But what we're,
[3097.34 --> 3098.76]  the big point is this,
[3099.02 --> 3100.46]  that these five things
[3100.46 --> 3101.42]  that God does,
[3101.54 --> 3101.78]  right,
[3101.86 --> 3102.88]  is like a chain
[3102.88 --> 3104.82]  for knowing
[3104.82 --> 3106.28]  and predestining
[3106.28 --> 3107.08]  and calling
[3107.08 --> 3107.98]  and justifying
[3107.98 --> 3109.12]  and glorifying
[3109.12 --> 3109.82]  and they're like
[3109.82 --> 3110.84]  these links on a chain
[3110.84 --> 3111.54]  and they're all part
[3111.54 --> 3112.56]  of one thing
[3112.56 --> 3113.70]  that God does
[3113.70 --> 3115.30]  to bring many sons
[3115.30 --> 3115.68]  and daughters
[3115.68 --> 3116.26]  to glory
[3116.26 --> 3117.68]  around Jesus Christ.
[3118.52 --> 3119.80]  It's all this one thing
[3119.80 --> 3120.32]  of salvation
[3120.32 --> 3121.18]  that God is doing.
[3122.00 --> 3123.16]  It's all part of
[3123.16 --> 3124.86]  the potter's great work.
[3126.66 --> 3127.04]  And so,
[3127.16 --> 3127.92]  what we can know
[3127.92 --> 3128.98]  is that in the middle
[3128.98 --> 3130.12]  of our own weakness
[3130.12 --> 3130.98]  and sin
[3130.98 --> 3131.72]  and the suffering
[3131.72 --> 3132.64]  that we experience,
[3132.90 --> 3133.92]  we can be assured
[3133.92 --> 3135.22]  that whatever is happening
[3135.22 --> 3136.08]  in our lives,
[3136.38 --> 3138.40]  it all ends in glory.
[3139.62 --> 3140.92]  It all ends in glory.
[3141.02 --> 3141.94]  It all ends in
[3141.94 --> 3143.14]  being conformed
[3143.14 --> 3144.24]  into the image of Christ.
[3144.72 --> 3145.22]  And remember
[3145.22 --> 3146.18]  what Paul has said.
[3146.26 --> 3146.96]  It's a glory
[3146.96 --> 3148.72]  to be revealed in us
[3148.72 --> 3150.58]  that so far outweighs
[3150.58 --> 3151.58]  anything suffered
[3151.58 --> 3152.18]  in this life
[3152.18 --> 3153.04]  that it's not even
[3153.04 --> 3153.64]  worth comparing.
[3156.50 --> 3157.84]  And I think the reason
[3157.84 --> 3159.40]  all of these words
[3159.40 --> 3160.86]  are in the past tense
[3160.86 --> 3162.00]  is that they are all
[3162.00 --> 3163.22]  absolutely certain.
[3163.98 --> 3165.04]  In God's will
[3165.04 --> 3166.10]  and his plan,
[3166.64 --> 3167.38]  his ability
[3167.38 --> 3168.54]  to carry out
[3168.54 --> 3168.94]  that plan
[3168.94 --> 3169.58]  and accomplish
[3169.58 --> 3170.74]  his purposes for us,
[3170.84 --> 3172.10]  it's as good as done.
[3172.96 --> 3173.98]  Even as it's still
[3173.98 --> 3174.78]  being worked out
[3174.78 --> 3175.36]  in time
[3175.36 --> 3176.18]  in our own lives.
[3177.40 --> 3177.86]  So,
[3178.00 --> 3178.58]  for that reason,
[3178.68 --> 3179.14]  we can have
[3179.14 --> 3180.76]  absolute assurance.
[3180.76 --> 3181.54]  We can have
[3181.54 --> 3182.60]  absolute confidence
[3182.60 --> 3183.70]  that everything
[3183.70 --> 3184.52]  that is happening
[3184.52 --> 3185.30]  in our lives
[3185.30 --> 3187.62]  will lead to our glory.
[3188.62 --> 3189.18]  Now,
[3189.24 --> 3189.78]  the last thing
[3189.78 --> 3190.52]  we need to notice
[3190.52 --> 3191.74]  about verse 28
[3191.74 --> 3193.86]  is who this promise
[3193.86 --> 3194.68]  is for.
[3195.84 --> 3196.02]  Okay,
[3196.02 --> 3196.80]  so let's go back
[3196.80 --> 3198.12]  and look at verse 28.
[3198.22 --> 3198.86]  What does this say?
[3199.48 --> 3200.50]  Who is this promise for?
[3201.70 --> 3202.68]  For the good
[3202.68 --> 3203.76]  of those
[3203.76 --> 3205.72]  who love him.
[3207.04 --> 3207.82]  For the good
[3207.82 --> 3208.66]  of those who love him.
[3208.66 --> 3210.80]  Paul is not
[3210.80 --> 3211.64]  trying to comfort
[3211.64 --> 3214.12]  the entire human race
[3214.12 --> 3215.26]  in this verse.
[3216.20 --> 3217.82]  It's not a blanket promise
[3217.82 --> 3219.42]  for all people everywhere.
[3219.88 --> 3220.50]  It's not saying
[3220.50 --> 3221.60]  to the entire human race,
[3221.86 --> 3222.38]  don't worry,
[3222.58 --> 3223.30]  everything is going
[3223.30 --> 3223.90]  to work out well
[3223.90 --> 3224.38]  in the end.
[3225.76 --> 3226.68]  This promise,
[3226.78 --> 3227.70]  this amazing promise
[3227.70 --> 3229.26]  is for Christians.
[3230.94 --> 3231.48]  Paul says
[3231.48 --> 3232.16]  it's for those
[3232.16 --> 3233.28]  who love God.
[3234.38 --> 3234.90]  It's for those
[3234.90 --> 3235.82]  who have been called,
[3236.00 --> 3236.66]  called according
[3236.66 --> 3238.14]  according to God's purpose.
[3239.70 --> 3240.14]  Now,
[3240.24 --> 3241.14]  it's not that
[3241.14 --> 3242.56]  we love God
[3242.56 --> 3243.08]  and therefore
[3243.08 --> 3244.04]  God calls us.
[3245.94 --> 3246.58]  It's that
[3246.58 --> 3247.32]  he has set
[3247.32 --> 3248.24]  his love
[3248.24 --> 3249.48]  upon us,
[3249.92 --> 3250.90]  he has called
[3250.90 --> 3251.92]  us to himself,
[3252.16 --> 3252.90]  and that's how
[3252.90 --> 3253.84]  we can now love him.
[3255.18 --> 3255.38]  Right?
[3255.42 --> 3256.02]  Our love for him
[3256.02 --> 3257.04]  is always a response
[3257.04 --> 3258.06]  to God's gracious
[3258.06 --> 3259.48]  call to us.
[3260.20 --> 3260.76]  And so Christians,
[3260.94 --> 3261.66]  we are the ones
[3261.66 --> 3262.28]  who have been
[3262.28 --> 3263.36]  called by God,
[3263.52 --> 3264.20]  by grace,
[3264.28 --> 3265.34]  not of our own doing,
[3265.34 --> 3266.92]  who have been
[3266.92 --> 3268.18]  drawn to himself,
[3268.64 --> 3269.42]  and who have been,
[3269.74 --> 3271.26]  had the love of God
[3271.26 --> 3272.16]  poured into our hearts
[3272.16 --> 3272.76]  by the Spirit,
[3272.86 --> 3273.50]  and so we respond
[3273.50 --> 3274.32]  to God in love.
[3275.24 --> 3276.00]  We love God.
[3277.00 --> 3277.98]  Do we do it
[3277.98 --> 3279.14]  consistently?
[3279.92 --> 3280.34]  No.
[3281.62 --> 3282.64]  We don't fully,
[3283.22 --> 3284.34]  we don't love him fully,
[3284.40 --> 3285.16]  we still battle
[3285.16 --> 3286.20]  with our sinful nature,
[3286.74 --> 3286.88]  right?
[3286.94 --> 3287.52]  Romans 7
[3287.52 --> 3288.82]  is full of that.
[3289.06 --> 3289.78]  But we really
[3289.78 --> 3290.40]  do love him.
[3291.96 --> 3292.40]  Right?
[3292.42 --> 3293.52]  We have a new heart,
[3293.60 --> 3294.18]  we have these new
[3294.18 --> 3295.18]  affections for him
[3295.18 --> 3295.98]  that has been given
[3295.98 --> 3296.86]  to us by the Spirit.
[3297.14 --> 3297.94]  So every Christian
[3297.94 --> 3298.38]  can say,
[3298.52 --> 3298.64]  yeah,
[3298.70 --> 3299.50]  I love God.
[3301.52 --> 3302.68]  And so if you are here
[3302.68 --> 3303.26]  this morning
[3303.26 --> 3303.94]  and you're not
[3303.94 --> 3304.78]  a Christian believer,
[3305.18 --> 3306.18]  this promise is not
[3306.18 --> 3306.60]  for you.
[3308.26 --> 3309.90]  But it could be.
[3311.12 --> 3311.34]  Right?
[3311.44 --> 3312.82]  God is making
[3312.82 --> 3314.48]  this promise,
[3314.92 --> 3316.02]  making this assurance,
[3316.34 --> 3317.30]  this consolation
[3317.30 --> 3318.90]  available to you,
[3319.22 --> 3319.94]  to anyone
[3319.94 --> 3321.26]  who would believe
[3321.26 --> 3322.08]  in Jesus Christ.
[3322.08 --> 3322.16]  Christ.
[3323.16 --> 3324.04]  So if you're thinking,
[3324.28 --> 3325.36]  I want this assurance,
[3325.48 --> 3326.72]  I want this consolation
[3326.72 --> 3327.88]  from a heavenly father
[3327.88 --> 3328.68]  who's saying,
[3328.84 --> 3329.46]  in my life,
[3329.58 --> 3330.50]  he has a plan
[3330.50 --> 3331.24]  for me.
[3331.96 --> 3333.04]  If you want that,
[3333.18 --> 3334.06]  that is a very good
[3334.06 --> 3334.54]  indication
[3334.54 --> 3336.36]  that God is calling you
[3336.36 --> 3337.72]  and that God is pouring
[3337.72 --> 3338.84]  his love into your heart.
[3339.86 --> 3341.04]  And I'd love to talk
[3341.04 --> 3341.64]  to you about that.
[3342.66 --> 3343.56]  For those of us
[3343.56 --> 3344.32]  who are Christians,
[3344.50 --> 3345.56]  who know we love God,
[3345.62 --> 3346.16]  we've been called
[3346.16 --> 3347.24]  according to his purposes,
[3347.54 --> 3348.58]  what does this promise
[3348.58 --> 3349.42]  mean for us?
[3350.08 --> 3350.64]  What does it mean
[3350.64 --> 3352.04]  for our present moment?
[3352.96 --> 3353.40]  It means that
[3353.40 --> 3354.16]  every single thing
[3354.16 --> 3354.88]  happening to you
[3354.88 --> 3355.44]  right now,
[3355.68 --> 3356.62]  this day even,
[3356.98 --> 3358.62]  is working together
[3358.62 --> 3359.38]  for your good
[3359.38 --> 3361.18]  to conform you
[3361.18 --> 3362.12]  into the image of Christ.
[3362.38 --> 3363.56]  And it means that
[3363.56 --> 3364.82]  what confidence
[3364.82 --> 3365.34]  can it give us
[3365.34 --> 3365.94]  for the future?
[3366.40 --> 3367.46]  It gives you confidence
[3367.46 --> 3368.42]  that there is nothing
[3368.42 --> 3369.10]  in this world
[3369.10 --> 3370.14]  that can happen to you
[3370.14 --> 3371.34]  that is not making you
[3371.34 --> 3372.52]  more like Jesus Christ
[3372.52 --> 3374.00]  and bringing you
[3374.00 --> 3374.48]  to glory.
[3376.26 --> 3377.12]  That's the promise.
[3377.62 --> 3378.48]  So let's pray together.
[3378.48 --> 3382.92]  Lord, we thank you
[3382.92 --> 3383.54]  for your word.
[3383.88 --> 3384.62]  And we ask that
[3384.62 --> 3385.58]  these verses would
[3385.58 --> 3386.72]  not simply be
[3386.72 --> 3388.62]  a passage that we memorize
[3388.62 --> 3390.76]  and just leave it at that,
[3391.46 --> 3392.66]  but that they would be
[3392.66 --> 3395.00]  a passage we can believe.
[3395.58 --> 3396.54]  A passage that we can
[3396.54 --> 3397.88]  even cling to
[3397.88 --> 3400.40]  tighter than ever.
[3401.84 --> 3402.66]  And we ask that
[3402.66 --> 3403.28]  the Holy Spirit
[3403.28 --> 3404.30]  would take these words
[3404.30 --> 3405.52]  and apply them to us
[3405.52 --> 3407.16]  so that we can cling
[3407.16 --> 3407.90]  to your promises.
[3408.48 --> 3410.36]  And we are assured
[3410.36 --> 3411.56]  that behind every
[3411.56 --> 3413.04]  frowning providence,
[3413.44 --> 3414.10]  there is indeed
[3414.10 --> 3415.08]  a smiling face.
[3416.08 --> 3417.22]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[3417.92 --> 3418.24]  Amen.
[3422.24 --> 3424.04]  So as our singers
[3424.04 --> 3424.60]  come forward,
[3424.80 --> 3426.00]  let's get ready to sing
[3426.00 --> 3427.00]  and let's all stand together.
[3427.00 --> 3428.84]  Arbeits contractors
[3428.84 --> 3442.82]  tales from
[3442.82 --> 3453.56]  the Lord.
[3453.56 --> 3457.76]  Grace is Jesus, my Redeemer.
[3458.76 --> 3464.60]  There is no more for heaven now to give.
[3464.60 --> 3470.56]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[3471.38 --> 3477.00]  My sin is love, my deep and balanced peace.
[3477.50 --> 3482.62]  To this I hold, my hope is holy Jesus.
[3483.56 --> 3489.18]  For my life is holy, bound to peace.
[3489.18 --> 3494.18]  Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[3494.50 --> 3500.42]  All is mine, yet not I can rise to me.
[3500.42 --> 3515.04]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[3515.04 --> 3520.66]  For by my side, the Savior, He will stay.
[3520.66 --> 3527.28]  I labor on in meekness and rejoicing.
[3527.28 --> 3533.28]  For in my name, His power is displayed.
[3533.28 --> 3539.90]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[3539.90 --> 3545.90]  Through the deepest valley He will lead.
[3545.90 --> 3552.52]  All the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[3552.52 --> 3558.14]  All the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[3558.14 --> 3572.98]  No faith I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[3573.76 --> 3578.76]  The future's sure, the rising earth was made.
[3578.76 --> 3580.38]  For Jesus, I am not forsaken.
[3580.38 --> 3585.38]  For Jesus, I am glad and suffered for my pardon.
[3586.38 --> 3592.00]  And He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[3592.38 --> 3597.38]  To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[3597.38 --> 3599.38]  Jesus, now and ever, my sin has been defeated.
[3599.38 --> 3604.38]  Jesus, now and ever, my sin has been defeated.
[3604.38 --> 3609.38]  All the chains are released, I can see.
[3609.38 --> 3616.38]  I am free and I put through Christ in me.
[3616.38 --> 3631.38]  With every breath, I long to follow Jesus.
[3631.38 --> 3637.38]  For He has said that He will bring me home.
[3637.38 --> 3643.38]  In day by day, I know He will bring me.
[3643.38 --> 3649.38]  Until I stand with joy before the throne.
[3649.38 --> 3655.38]  To this I hold, my hopeless only Jesus.
[3655.38 --> 3661.38]  All the glory evermore to Him.
[3661.38 --> 3668.38]  When the grace is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[3668.38 --> 3673.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[3673.38 --> 3680.38]  When the grace is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[3680.38 --> 3686.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[3686.38 --> 3711.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[3711.38 --> 3716.38]  Our offering this morning is for Chaplain and Refugee Support Mobilizer.
[3716.38 --> 3720.38]  Which is ministering out of First CRC in Vancouver.
[3720.38 --> 3726.38]  And this ministry provides welcome for refugees and support in communities.
[3726.38 --> 3730.38]  And also helping local congregations with that support.
[3730.38 --> 3733.38]  So I ask the deacons to come forward now.
[3733.38 --> 3735.38]  And please give as you are able.
[3735.38 --> 3738.38]  Again Christian.
[3738.38 --> 3741.38]  To that event of cried,
[3741.38 --> 3742.38]  I would give amen.
[3742.38 --> 3744.38]  As a march of adjourned from heaven.
[3745.38 --> 3747.38]  To that event of Greece is well known.
[3747.38 --> 3760.38]  That舞台 is also calledửed from Essentially Ho alto Tri JC.
[3760.38 --> 3761.38]  Amen.
[3790.38 --> 3792.38]  Amen.
[3820.38 --> 3822.38]  Amen.
[3850.38 --> 3854.04]  Congregational prayer, we're going to be praying for John Smith, who is in hospital.
[3854.76 --> 3861.22]  So John had a minor stroke, I believe on Friday or yesterday, and although he's feeling well,
[3861.38 --> 3864.40]  he's being kept at hospital for observation.
[3865.06 --> 3869.42]  I spoke to Elaine this morning, and she says that he's already regaining some function in
[3869.42 --> 3876.12]  his hand and his arm, so we praise God for that, and we wish for John to make a full and
[3876.12 --> 3876.78]  speedy recovery.
[3877.34 --> 3879.66]  So let's come to God now in prayer.
[3880.38 --> 3881.38]  Amen.
[3884.68 --> 3889.84]  Glory and power to you, O Lord, maker of heaven and earth.
[3890.54 --> 3896.24]  With a word you set the stars in the night sky and raised dry land from the deep.
[3896.98 --> 3900.48]  You spoke in thunder, and the waters fled.
[3901.40 --> 3904.32]  They flowed over the mountains and went down into the valleys.
[3904.32 --> 3908.92]  You set the earth on its foundations where it can never be moved.
[3908.92 --> 3916.02]  We walk this earth but a moment and know not what came before or what will follow, but
[3916.02 --> 3919.48]  you, O Lord, are the first and the last.
[3920.48 --> 3924.12]  Your creation is a reflection of your wisdom and goodness.
[3924.12 --> 3928.22]  You have generously shared this abundance with us.
[3928.22 --> 3934.66]  You have created us in your image, set apart from all other living things to care for and
[3934.66 --> 3936.76]  to tend to your creation.
[3937.46 --> 3938.92]  You have given us a bounty.
[3939.76 --> 3942.60]  We praise you, Lord, and give you thanks for this prosperity.
[3942.60 --> 3948.70]  But we confess this morning that we have failed to care for your creation.
[3949.70 --> 3952.20]  Sin has turned our hearts away from your kingdom work.
[3953.06 --> 3959.00]  We take for granted and, yes, even destroy your creation, serving our own foolish whims and
[3959.00 --> 3961.50]  desires instead of following in your ways.
[3961.50 --> 3964.60]  We let your work go undone.
[3964.60 --> 3968.60]  And we take the easy path at the first sign of hardship.
[3969.60 --> 3973.74]  The few things we care for, we covet and even idolize.
[3974.50 --> 3979.18]  How foolish we are to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[3980.14 --> 3982.44]  We do not love our neighbor as we should.
[3982.44 --> 3990.80]  While we are fed and clothed and rested, so many in this world go hungry, cold, and weary.
[3992.20 --> 3996.88]  We have forgotten them, Lord, yet you never forget them.
[3997.88 --> 4004.50]  Thank you for your steadfast love and for your ultimate sacrifice you made through your son, Jesus.
[4005.30 --> 4007.22]  Your grace is enough.
[4008.02 --> 4011.58]  Our sins are many, but your mercy is more.
[4012.44 --> 4019.46]  We pray this morning for our leaders locally here in Delta, but also our province and our whole country.
[4020.36 --> 4021.78]  Grant them wisdom and humility.
[4022.76 --> 4025.68]  We ask for leadership that works towards justice.
[4026.80 --> 4033.96]  May their decisions bring prosperity and peace to all, but especially those who are most marginalized by society.
[4034.54 --> 4040.20]  We pray in particular for Ukraine, Gaza, Congo, and the Sudan.
[4040.20 --> 4045.16]  The suffering is immense there, and they need your sovereignty.
[4046.52 --> 4050.94]  And closer to home, we ask for comfort for our congregation.
[4052.02 --> 4056.06]  Draw near to those suffering from illness or for those caring for them.
[4056.06 --> 4065.32]  We pray for Pat, Michael, Eileen, Han and Liz, Sean, and Jenny's mom, Grace, and for Tony.
[4065.32 --> 4073.62]  Lord, we lift up Mel and Shirley, who are dealing with serious health concerns, both new and longstanding.
[4074.32 --> 4082.64]  And Lord, we praise you, for we know that Mel is making a bit of a recovery, and we ask for more healing, Lord, and a complete remission from pain.
[4082.64 --> 4086.80]  We also pray for John Smith, who is in hospital this morning.
[4087.60 --> 4092.28]  We thank you that he and Elaine recognized the symptoms he was experiencing and acted upon them,
[4092.50 --> 4095.82]  and for the wonderful care that he has received at Richmond Hospital.
[4096.88 --> 4102.30]  We pray for a clean bill of health, and that we are eager to see him back at church soon.
[4102.30 --> 4112.78]  Lastly, we pray for those among us, our brothers and sisters here at church, our neighbors here in Delta and Richmond, our coworkers, and our friends.
[4113.48 --> 4120.52]  We lift them up to you, Lord, and I know that you share in their burdens, both seen and unseen.
[4121.46 --> 4126.28]  May we know that they are loved and that they find comfort within this community.
[4126.28 --> 4133.78]  And for those that do not know you, Lord, we ask you to empower us to spread the good news of your gospel.
[4134.44 --> 4138.70]  Help us to live lives that are worthy of being called Christians.
[4139.62 --> 4141.76]  Without you, we are helpless.
[4142.66 --> 4146.12]  But through your Holy Spirit, all things are possible.
[4147.42 --> 4150.24]  You walk among us, and you fill us up with your Spirit.
[4151.14 --> 4154.26]  Help us to always look to you when we struggle.
[4154.26 --> 4157.98]  In Jesus' powerful name, we pray all of this.
[4158.74 --> 4158.96]  Amen.
[4170.78 --> 4171.68]  Let's rise.
[4173.38 --> 4179.58]  And in our beginning of our service, God welcomes and calls us to himself in worship.
[4179.58 --> 4185.42]  And then at the end of our service, God sends us out, and he sends us out with his blessing upon us.
[4185.58 --> 4190.48]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing upon you.
[4190.98 --> 4198.08]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with each of you, now and always.
[4198.52 --> 4198.78]  Amen.
[4199.46 --> 4202.68]  Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[4202.68 --> 4205.76]  And join us for a time of fellowship, right?
[4206.10 --> 4207.64]  Through the doors at the end of the service.
[4207.64 --> 4226.02]  Father in heaven, how we love you.
[4227.02 --> 4231.64]  We lift your name in all the earth.
[4231.64 --> 4237.86]  May the kingdom be established, turn our braces.
[4239.36 --> 4243.86]  As your people declare your mighty words.
[4243.86 --> 4249.96]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4249.96 --> 4256.24]  Who was and is and is to God.
[4256.24 --> 4262.08]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4262.08 --> 4268.46]  Who reigns forevermore.
[4270.58 --> 4274.76]  Father, our mercy be exalted.
[4276.38 --> 4280.72]  May Jesus' name be lifted high.
[4280.72 --> 4282.72]  For the sacrifice of God,
[4282.72 --> 4286.72]  For the sacrifice of God has won our pardon.
[4286.72 --> 4293.72]  And His resurrection power gives us life.
[4293.72 --> 4299.72]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4299.72 --> 4305.72]  Who was and is and is to God.
[4305.72 --> 4312.40]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4312.40 --> 4313.98]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4313.98 --> 4321.94]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
[4321.94 --> 4331.36]  Who was and is and is to come.
[4331.36 --> 4337.56]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[4337.56 --> 4345.46]  Who reigns forevermore
[4361.36 --> 4391.34]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[4391.36 --> 4421.34]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
[4421.36 --> 4451.34]  Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
