• Main idea is that there are two kinds of people: those who live according to the flesh and those who live according to the spirit
• The flesh refers to living based on desires and selfishness, while the spirit refers to living based on God's will and guidance
• Paul's message in Romans 8 emphasizes the distinction between these two types of people as being deeper than politics, personalities, or preferences (such as ice cream)
• Living according to the flesh means having one's mind set on what the flesh desires, while living according to the spirit means having one's mind set on what the spirit desires
• The concept of orientation is used to understand this distinction, where people are oriented towards certain things that shape and govern their lives.
• The concept of "flesh" in the Bible refers to a natural inclination that inclines people away from God
• This inclination is fundamental and present in every human being, making them hostile or indifferent to God
• Hostility towards God can be thought of as ignoring Him despite knowing He is at work in one's life, leading to living independently of God
• According to the Bible, humans are born with this natural state, meaning no one is spiritually neutral by birth
• The concept of "spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit given to Christians, who have a fundamental orientation towards God.
• The concept of being a "blank sheet of paper" with no inherent goodness
• The natural inclination towards sin and hostility towards God
• Total depravity, meaning humans are spiritually incapable of responding to God in their natural state
• The inability to submit to God's laws due to spiritual incapability, not because of the demands of God's laws being unfair
• The third point is that those who are "in the flesh" cannot please God, but this actually implies that God desires to be pleased
• The concept of pleasing God and its relationship to living according to the flesh
• Adam and Eve's inability to please God after sinning
• Jesus as an exception, being born with a fundamental orientation towards God
• Jesus' life of worship, honour, and submission to God's laws
• The role of the Holy Spirit in giving Jesus his deep orientation towards God
• Discussion of the Holy Spirit's role in giving Christians an orientation towards God
• Comparison between living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit
• Reference to John chapter 3, where Jesus says we are born again/born of the Spirit
• Explanation that the Holy Spirit gives us a deep orientation towards God
• The Holy Spirit is called "the Spirit of Christ" and comes to glorify Christ in one's heart and life.
• The Holy Spirit lives permanently in believers, giving them a new orientation to Christ and his kingdom.
• God's plan is not just to create non-condemned people but to have a people who walk in His ways, follow Him, and please Him.
• The Holy Spirit is given to believers to live according to the Spirit.
• The speaker emphasizes that Christians have a new identity in Christ and are no longer defined by their fleshly desires.
• Many Christians struggle with sin and assume they must still be of the flesh, rather than recognizing their newfound spiritual nature.
• The speaker encourages Christians to recognize that they have been given a new heart and made new by the Holy Spirit.
• Ongoing failures do not mean one is not living in the Spirit, but rather it's a process of letting the Spirit change and transform them.
• A key indicator of being alive in the Spirit is a desire to live for Jesus, worship and honour God, obey His laws, and please Him.
• The Holy Spirit works in believers to make them sensitive to the reality of sin
• Believers have confidence before God because the Spirit is at work in them
• Believers must act in accordance with the Spirit and live in obedience to Him
• Christians may still struggle with fleshly thoughts and temptations despite having the Spirit within them
• The Bible gives examples of how believers, even with the Spirit's presence, can still be tempted and struggle with sin.
• Jesus rebukes Peter for not setting his mind on the things of God
• The importance of setting one's mind on the things of God as a follower of Jesus
• Philippians 4:8 is used as an example to set one's mind on true, noble, and praiseworthy things
• Christians have a duty to set their minds on the Spirit and Christ's kingdom
• The grace of God helps us to do this by setting our minds on the things of Christ.
• Prayers for spiritual rebirth and renewal
• Praise and worship through song
• Reflection on salvation and forgiveness

• Linda Gerald shares her experience and mission with a congregation

• Life Water provides water and sanitation services to communities overseas, particularly in Africa and Haiti
• The motivation behind the work of Life Water comes from a personal experience of illness and the desire to give back to the world
• Infant mortality rates are high in some countries where Life Water works, and the organization aims to help alleviate this issue.
• Customary not to name an infant until they were a month-old due to high mortality rates
• Infants would be named and given water for the first time during a ceremony, symbolizing life

• The program is now being initiated in Liberia and considered for implementation in Haiti (with potential for micro-enterprise development)
• A large team operates in Nigeria and smaller teams operate in Kenya, Haiti, and Liberia
• Early work in Liberia involved providing water for basic needs
• Three-phase approach: training local people, equipping them, and funding their efforts

• COVID-19 did not hinder operations due to established foundation and knowledge
