[287.18 → 288.94] Good morning.
[288.94 → 292.42] Welcome to worship today at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[292.70 → 297.30] My name is Jason True, and I will be leading us in the liturgy and the preaching.
[297.90 → 302.04] Marian Mandrel will be leading us in our music along with our singers.
[302.70 → 305.24] And a very special welcome to you if you are visiting.
[305.70 → 307.48] We are so glad that you are with us today.
[308.24 → 310.40] Just a few announcements as we begin.
[310.62 → 315.10] So right after the service today, we are having our soup and bun lunch.
[315.10 → 319.48] So please plan to stay and enjoy some fellowship.
[319.94 → 321.94] And I encourage you, it worked out well last time.
[322.42 → 323.80] Don't sit with your family.
[324.82 → 326.38] Spread out, sit with others.
[326.60 → 329.10] Especially maybe some you don't always get to talk to.
[330.70 → 336.96] So next week, March 30th, we are beginning a membership class.
[337.18 → 340.22] Or an introduction to Ladder CRC kind of class.
[340.36 → 343.24] So that is the next, beginning next week.
[343.24 → 344.88] And then for three Sundays in a row.
[345.26 → 347.46] And we hope to receive new members on Easter Sunday.
[347.84 → 353.92] If you would like to learn more or find out more about it, feel free to find me after the service.
[355.68 → 363.06] In addition, our new cross-training class for the spring will be coming up, beginning sometime.
[364.14 → 365.54] And I don't have it.
[365.92 → 366.82] It's in your bulletin.
[367.32 → 370.58] It will be a class on the topic of Christian worldview.
[370.58 → 374.54] How do we live in the world as Christians?
[375.04 → 378.66] And where does our view of God, ourselves, the world come from?
[378.84 → 379.68] Well, it comes from scripture.
[380.30 → 385.12] But then we have the surrounding culture, which is also maybe lives out of a different worldview.
[385.28 → 387.16] And so there's a tension there.
[387.76 → 391.10] And so it's good for us to understand what is the Christian worldview?
[391.26 → 392.58] What are some of the surrounding worldviews?
[393.58 → 395.48] And then how can we be faithful to the Lord?
[396.28 → 397.64] I invite you to come out to that.
[397.64 → 399.92] There's a brochure in your mailboxes that tells you more.
[400.80 → 402.76] And Marian has an announcement as well.
[410.78 → 411.48] Good morning.
[413.02 → 416.14] Next week, we are going to have a visitor from World Renew.
[416.14 → 419.54] I'm sorry I dropped the ball putting this in the bulletin.
[420.16 → 426.64] Daniel Friesen is going to fly out next week to visit some of the churches locally.
[427.06 → 432.34] And he has been working with World Renew since 1994.
[432.80 → 436.44] And he has worked in community development in various areas.
[436.52 → 439.44] I won't give you all the details now because he will tell you himself.
[439.44 → 443.58] And so he is a consultant right now.
[443.58 → 445.72] And he has been working in Sierra Leone.
[445.72 → 454.60] And he will give us some information on what's going on in Sierra Leone in terms of the work that's done with World Relief there.
[454.60 → 461.78] And so what I'm going to ask of you, and I'm going to put you on the spot right now because we have to decide what we're going to do,
[461.84 → 466.54] whether we're going to give him a longer slot during the service or whether we'll give him a shorter slot in the service
[466.54 → 470.70] and then give him time to give us more detail and answer questions after the service.
[471.32 → 475.32] So my question to you is, if you are here and if you are interested,
[475.32 → 481.40] would you stay, grab a cup of coffee, and come back to hear more about his work there after the service?
[481.92 → 482.40] Yes, no.
[482.40 → 483.40] Hands.
[485.92 → 489.98] A show of hands, please, so I know that we've got enough people that we can invite him to do that.
[490.24 → 491.02] I think we do.
[491.18 → 491.66] Thank you.
[492.36 → 496.74] So we look forward to hearing from him next week.
[497.00 → 497.38] Thanks.
[506.18 → 510.52] Okay, so now as we prepare our hearts for worship this morning,
[510.52 → 513.02] I want to invite us to slow down.
[513.80 → 522.78] It is the season of Lent, after all, and we come on Sunday morning with often so many different distractions on our minds.
[522.78 → 532.02] And so I want us to be open to what God has to say to us this morning about his love through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[532.10 → 536.76] So let's pause for a moment of silence, a moment of prayer, a moment to wait on the Lord,
[536.76 → 542.02] and for each of us to ask him to be with us this morning.
[542.72 → 544.18] And then we'll begin with our call to worship.
[544.18 → 544.34] Amen.
[544.34 → 544.48] Amen.
[544.48 → 544.88] Amen.
[544.88 → 544.92] Amen.
[544.92 → 545.24] Amen.

[601.32 → 610.36] You are the father of lights, and it is good to wait on you. And Lord, through your son and the
[610.36 → 616.62] glory of the cross and the victory of the resurrection, we see your salvation. So we pray
[616.62 → 621.66] that you would send your spirit among us now that we might lift our hearts and our voices to you
[621.66 → 629.60] and praise to the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And it is in the wonderful name of Jesus
[629.60 → 637.04] Christ, our Lord, that we pray. Amen. Let's all stand. And God greets us with these words from
[637.04 → 646.18] Psalm 66, verse 22. Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love
[646.18 → 650.88] from me. As the Lord has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another.
[676.18 → 684.64] according to his prayer to us. Let's pray. Okay. Well, let's play. He's at the

[968.64 → 970.64] Father, let your kingdom come.
[970.64 → 972.64] Let your kingdom come.
[972.64 → 975.64] Father, let your kingdom come.

[1089.84 → 1093.12] Father, let your kingdom come.
[1093.54 → 1096.56] Father, let your will be done.
[1096.56 → 1103.26] On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[1103.26 → 1107.10] Father, let your kingdom come.
[1107.90 → 1111.04] Father, let your will be done.
[1111.04 → 1117.80] On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[1117.80 → 1119.80] Father, let your will be done.
[1119.80 → 1125.80] On earth as in heaven, right here in my heart.
[1125.80 → 1133.64] Father, let your will be done.
[1133.64 → 1134.06] You may be seated.
[1141.36 → 1147.22] Our first scripture reading, our gospel lesson, this morning is from Matthew chapter 9.
[1147.22 → 1154.16] That is on a page in your Bible.
[1155.00 → 1155.60] I'll find it.
[1155.60 → 1156.04] Hold on.
[1162.68 → 1165.94] That's on page 723 in your pew Bible, the brown one.
[1165.94 → 1173.98] So a little bit of a shorter passage, Matthew chapter 9, and we'll read verses 9 through 13.
[1173.98 → 1182.22] As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth.
[1183.02 → 1185.18] Follow me, he told him.
[1185.64 → 1187.28] And Matthew got up and followed him.
[1188.00 → 1195.58] While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
[1196.30 → 1199.08] When the disciples saw this, they asked his disciples.
[1199.08 → 1205.78] When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
[1206.80 → 1212.78] On hearing this, Jesus said, it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.
[1213.40 → 1215.56] But go and learn what this means.
[1215.68 → 1217.86] I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[1218.38 → 1222.10] For I have not come to call this righteous, but sinners.
[1222.96 → 1224.10] This is the word of the Lord.
[1224.70 → 1225.72] Thanks be to God.
[1225.72 → 1230.92] So in this Lenten season, you know, it's a season of waiting.
[1231.96 → 1241.08] Not waiting on God to get around to doing what we want, which is often what we think of when we think of waiting on God.
[1241.74 → 1249.74] But rather, the waiting itself becomes part of the process of us becoming the kind of people that God wants us to become.
[1249.74 → 1253.50] Lent reminds us that we are not in control.
[1254.76 → 1256.16] And that God is.
[1256.34 → 1257.74] And so we wait on him.
[1259.22 → 1263.02] And in that waiting, we are also, though, not passive.
[1263.68 → 1272.28] God often wants, he waits on us until we then are opening to the Spirit's work in our hearts.
[1272.28 → 1279.18] The good work of the Spirit transforming us and helping us to trust in the Lord even more.
[1280.30 → 1285.74] And part of this active waiting that we do as Christians is confession.
[1286.90 → 1289.18] Confession is a part of waiting on the Lord.
[1289.38 → 1297.84] It's because confession leads to repentance, which is a movement, an active movement, away from our sin and towards God.
[1297.84 → 1307.64] But in the midst of that, we are waiting for all the things that the Spirit does, all of his good work in our hearts.
[1307.86 → 1312.70] And so we open up our hearts to him in humility, asking for him to work.
[1313.12 → 1317.98] And so let's first hear this call to confession from Lamentations chapter 3.
[1318.50 → 1321.36] And then I will lead us in a prayer of confession.
[1322.16 → 1325.02] So this is what Jeremiah writes in the book of Lamentations.
[1325.02 → 1328.02] It's called a corporate confession.
[1328.20 → 1330.94] It says, let us examine our ways and test them.
[1331.90 → 1333.78] And let us return to the Lord.
[1334.16 → 1339.18] Let us lift our hearts and our hands to God in heaven and say,
[1339.94 → 1342.36] we have sinned and rebelled.
[1343.36 → 1345.18] Would you join me in a prayer of confession?
[1346.00 → 1346.74] Let's pray together.
[1348.48 → 1353.52] Forgive us, Father, when we forget that grace runs downhill.
[1353.52 → 1358.98] That you love us and that we're not always very lovely.
[1360.52 → 1367.66] Remind us about the log that is sometimes in our eye when we try to take the splinter out of someone else's eye.
[1369.10 → 1372.98] Father, we come before you knowing that we are sinful and that we are weak.
[1374.00 → 1380.02] Father, our boat is so little and the ocean of who you are is so big.
[1380.02 → 1384.78] And so, Lord, we come to you as a child would come to a father,
[1385.56 → 1389.30] asking that you would meet us, that you would forgive us our sins,
[1389.64 → 1394.04] that you would make us gentle and kind and wise like Jesus,
[1394.66 → 1396.32] that you would heal us,
[1397.20 → 1404.78] and that you would be to us the one who makes all the difference in the world to us.
[1404.78 → 1409.48] We thank you for your unfailing love to us.
[1409.60 → 1411.24] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1414.32 → 1423.12] Now, when we are distraught because of our sin or distressed because of the suffering that we face in a broken world,
[1423.20 → 1426.08] it often feels that God does not hear our cries.
[1426.08 → 1433.46] But God assures us in his word that he does hear us and that he does answer us.
[1433.88 → 1436.66] So, hear these words of assurance that God gives us.
[1436.82 → 1439.66] Also, a few verses later in Lamentations chapter 3.
[1440.48 → 1441.18] It says this,
[1441.18 → 1456.66] Thanks be to God.
[1457.60 → 1459.00] So, let's stand.
[1459.32 → 1462.02] And in response to God's love and mercy to us,
[1462.12 → 1465.02] let's sing some songs of response together.
[1465.02 → 1488.52] My soul longs for the Lord in a weary land.
[1488.52 → 1518.50] The Lord in a weary land.
[1518.52 → 1548.50] Let's sing some songs of response together.
[1548.50 → 1554.50] Your name is finished from every sin set free.
[1554.50 → 1558.74] Oh, the victory of Christ.
[1559.14 → 1560.40] Word of God.
[1560.50 → 1562.88] Word of life.
[1562.88 → 1575.64] How often in the stillness have I heard your voice.
[1575.64 → 1582.92] Every whisper, every promise calls my heart to rejoice.
[1582.92 → 1586.92] In the quiet of the morning,
[1586.92 → 1588.92] In the quiet of the morning,
[1588.92 → 1590.72] Through the marches of the night,
[1590.72 → 1594.62] In the far out of my struggles,
[1594.62 → 1598.04] There's courage for the fight.
[1598.04 → 1600.04] Oh, the power of Christ.
[1600.04 → 1601.64] Oh, the power of Christ.
[1602.04 → 1603.04] Word of God.
[1603.04 → 1606.04] Word of life.
[1606.04 → 1612.04] My soul longs for the Lord in a weary land.
[1612.04 → 1614.04] All wrongs for the Lord in a weary land.
[1614.04 → 1616.04] All wrongs for the Lord in a weary land.
[1616.04 → 1618.04] All wrongs for the Lord in a weary land.
[1618.04 → 1620.04] More than riches,
[1620.04 → 1622.04] More than favour,
[1622.04 → 1626.04] My delight in your word.
[1626.04 → 1630.04] Turn my gaze from all that's worthless.
[1630.04 → 1634.04] Set my heart on things above.
[1634.04 → 1638.04] Lay my life down your goodness,
[1638.04 → 1640.04] And wave truth and love.
[1640.04 → 1644.04] Oh, the wisdom of Christ.
[1644.04 → 1646.04] Word of God.
[1646.04 → 1650.04] Word of life.
[1650.04 → 1678.04] I will sing of my Redeemer,
[1678.04 → 1684.04] And His wondrous love to be.
[1684.04 → 1690.04] On the glow of the frost He's softer,
[1690.04 → 1696.04] On the curse He'll set me free.
[1696.04 → 1702.04] Sing, O sing, I'm my Redeemer,
[1702.04 → 1707.04] With His blood He purchased me.
[1707.04 → 1713.04] On the cross He's sealed like waters.
[1713.04 → 1719.04] Sing, O death, and make me free.
[1719.04 → 1725.04] I will tell the wondrous story,
[1725.04 → 1731.04] How my loss does day to save.
[1731.04 → 1737.04] In His mouth is love and mercy,
[1737.04 → 1743.04] He a frown of freely gain.
[1743.04 → 1749.04] Sing, O sing, I'm my Redeemer,
[1749.04 → 1753.04] With His blood He purchased me.
[1753.04 → 1755.04] On the cross He's sealed like waters.
[1755.04 → 1757.04] On the cross He's sealed like waters.
[1757.04 → 1759.04] In the death that made me free.
[1759.04 → 1761.04] I will sing, O God,
[1761.04 → 1765.04] Give Him, O God, and make me free.
[1765.04 → 1767.04] Sing, O sing, O God, and make me free.
[1767.04 → 1773.04] I will sing of my Redeemer,
[1773.04 → 1777.04] And His heavenly love to me.
[1777.04 → 1783.04] He from death to life has brought me,
[1783.04 → 1789.04] Son of God with Him to be.
[1789.04 → 1795.04] Sing, O sing, O my Redeemer,
[1795.04 → 1801.04] With His blood He purchased me.
[1801.04 → 1805.04] On the cross He's sealed like waters.
[1805.04 → 1811.04] Give Him, O God, and make me free.
[1811.04 → 1829.04] Sing, O sing, O sing, O Lord, and make me free.
[1829.04 → 1831.04] Okay. At this time, the children are dismissed
[1831.04 → 1834.04] to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1834.04 → 1851.50] And if you want to be opening in your Bibles to Lamentations chapter 3, you're invited to do so.
[1851.50 → 1859.80] That is Jeremiah Lamentations.
[1864.04 → 1870.30] So today is the third Sunday in the season of Lent.
[1870.90 → 1881.28] And during this season, we have been seeking to grow individually and as a church in the spiritual discipline of lament.
[1882.72 → 1892.18] And because you and I need help to do this, to do it well, we are in the midst of a five-week sermon series on the Book of Lamentations.
[1892.18 → 1898.50] And so if you missed the last week or two, here's just a brief review to get you up to speed.
[1899.48 → 1906.00] So Lamentations, I have found, is an incredible book, though often neglected.
[1906.70 → 1909.86] It is full of painful poetry.
[1910.70 → 1914.36] It's comprised of five poems written by the prophet Jeremiah.
[1914.36 → 1919.14] And Jeremiah is reflecting on the suffering of the city of Jerusalem.
[1919.90 → 1927.86] The city has been attacked and conquered by the Babylonian army, which was the world's superpower of the day.
[1928.72 → 1935.12] And most people, especially the cultural elites, have been carried off into slavery in Babylon.
[1935.12 → 1947.26] The lower classes left to starve to death in a city that is now in ruins that used to be a once glorious city.
[1948.52 → 1956.76] And now, and to make matters worse, it is clear that the suffering that has been inflicted on the people of God has come as a result of their own sin.
[1956.76 → 1960.54] And it has been brought on by God himself.
[1962.32 → 1972.26] In other words, they are experiencing God's judgment against them for their idolatry, for their injustice, and all the ways that they have turned away from the Lord.
[1972.26 → 1980.66] And so Jeremiah and the people of God respond to this judgment and this suffering with lament.
[1981.12 → 1986.88] With a voice of lament, telling the painful truth about all that they are witnessing and experiencing.
[1987.52 → 1992.20] And asking God to see, and to hear, and to intervene.
[1992.76 → 1994.66] To come to their aid and help them.
[1995.70 → 1998.56] And that's what the book of Lamentations is about.
[1998.56 → 2006.94] And at Lamentations, it teaches us that the appropriate response to our suffering is lament.
[2008.24 → 2010.70] To bring it before the Lord.
[2011.78 → 2014.98] So with that in mind, let's turn to our passage this morning.
[2015.66 → 2018.68] Lamentations chapter 3 is a long chapter.
[2018.88 → 2021.14] 66 verses, and we'll talk about that later.
[2021.70 → 2026.82] But today, we're going to focus on verses 19 to 33.
[2026.82 → 2031.44] So follow along with me, beginning in verse 19.
[2031.44 → 2039.10] I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.
[2040.06 → 2044.18] I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.
[2044.84 → 2048.76] Yet, this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope.
[2049.38 → 2052.46] Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed.
[2053.12 → 2055.14] For his compassions never fail.
[2055.44 → 2056.78] They are new every morning.
[2056.96 → 2058.52] Great is your faithfulness.
[2058.52 → 2062.20] I say to myself, the Lord is my portion.
[2062.92 → 2064.40] Therefore, I will wait for him.
[2065.02 → 2068.72] The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him.
[2069.16 → 2070.48] To the one who seeks him.
[2071.08 → 2075.16] It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.
[2075.82 → 2079.12] It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.
[2079.88 → 2081.82] Let him sit alone in silence.
[2082.08 → 2084.04] For the Lord has laid it on him.
[2084.42 → 2086.42] Let him bury his face in the dust.
[2086.42 → 2088.24] There may yet be hope.
[2088.84 → 2092.16] Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him.
[2092.52 → 2094.40] And let him be filled with disgrace.
[2095.12 → 2097.62] For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.
[2098.58 → 2101.16] Though he brings grief, he will show compassion.
[2101.44 → 2103.52] So great is his unfailing love.
[2104.02 → 2108.02] For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.
[2108.02 → 2110.82] This is the word of the Lord.
[2113.80 → 2119.96] So let's pray asking God for his help as we study his passage together.
[2120.12 → 2120.44] Let's pray.
[2121.72 → 2125.38] Father, we confess that we need your help to hear from you.
[2126.86 → 2131.24] And Lord, there are so many things that would steal our attention away.
[2131.24 → 2134.76] So much opposition we face to hearing your word.
[2136.10 → 2140.44] And so we pray, Lord, that you would come by your Holy Spirit and clear all of that away now.
[2141.16 → 2142.48] As you speak to us.
[2143.28 → 2150.48] Help us, Lord, to look to you even now in the midst of whatever laments we may be carrying in our hearts this morning.
[2151.06 → 2154.42] So that we may receive your help and your blessing.
[2154.78 → 2156.20] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2156.86 → 2157.16] Amen.
[2157.16 → 2157.24] Amen.
[2159.02 → 2160.68] So I'll begin with a story.
[2161.44 → 2172.22] In the later 1800s, there was a Presbyterian minister who was well-loved and admired by many different churches.
[2172.42 → 2174.14] People would travel to hear him speak.
[2174.64 → 2178.12] He pastored churches in the U.S., in Baltimore, and in New York City.
[2179.08 → 2183.06] His name was Malty Babcock.
[2183.26 → 2184.14] A little bit unusual name.
[2184.48 → 2185.44] Malty Babcock.
[2185.44 → 2188.24] I don't know very much about his life.
[2188.52 → 2189.94] Not much has been written about him.
[2190.52 → 2193.76] But he was a man who apparently knew suffering.
[2194.84 → 2199.88] For one thing, he and his wife had two children, both of whom died in infancy.
[2200.78 → 2205.20] He had been hospitalized for depression in his early 30s.
[2205.20 → 2209.80] And then, when he was only 42 years old, he was travelling to the Holy Land.
[2210.06 → 2216.60] He came down with this bacterial infection which caused severe pain and fever.
[2217.06 → 2219.66] And on his way home, he tragically died.
[2219.66 → 2226.22] Now, after his death, his wife published a few of the things that he wrote.
[2226.94 → 2232.32] One of which is a well-known hymn called, This Is My Father's World.
[2234.00 → 2237.08] The third stanza of that hymn, this is what we read.
[2237.08 → 2238.90] He says,
[2238.90 → 2240.46] This is my father's world.
[2241.10 → 2248.76] Oh, let me never forget that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet.
[2248.76 → 2256.62] See, during his life, Babcock surely experienced what he writes in that stanza.
[2256.74 → 2260.52] That the wrong often seems so strong.
[2261.34 → 2261.76] Right?
[2261.80 → 2267.34] That the sin and the brokenness of this world often seems so powerful and so present.
[2267.34 → 2274.14] But he also knew that he lived in a world that was created by a good God.
[2274.78 → 2279.10] In a world over which King Jesus, who is the King of the universe, reigns.
[2279.90 → 2282.80] And the same was true of Jeremiah.
[2283.62 → 2283.84] Right?
[2283.94 → 2287.16] Here in chapter 3, there's a shift in the way that Jeremiah writes.
[2287.74 → 2293.44] He goes from giving his third-person observations, as he has in chapters 1 and 2,
[2293.44 → 2298.12] about the suffering of God's people as he observes it.
[2298.62 → 2302.36] And in chapter 3, he shifts to a first-person narrative,
[2302.36 → 2309.28] where he expresses his own lament, his own feelings, his own experience of suffering.
[2310.32 → 2314.08] And as he does so, what we see Jeremiah do in these verses,
[2314.70 → 2317.02] is he takes an honest look at his suffering,
[2317.02 → 2324.44] but then he lifts his eyes and his heart to the Lord and draws close to God.
[2326.24 → 2328.24] And friends, that is what lament is for.
[2328.98 → 2329.16] Right?
[2329.20 → 2330.24] That's the purpose of lament.
[2330.36 → 2333.74] That in our suffering, we don't turn away from God,
[2333.82 → 2336.30] but we actually draw closer to God.
[2336.84 → 2339.56] That's why we lament before him.
[2340.80 → 2342.62] And so the question for us this morning is,
[2342.74 → 2344.54] how does Jeremiah do this?
[2345.50 → 2346.72] Then what can we learn?
[2346.72 → 2349.66] How can we learn to draw closer to God
[2349.66 → 2354.34] when we face the suffering and affliction of the world?
[2355.86 → 2357.78] And so what we're going to see from our passage is that
[2357.78 → 2359.42] in the midst of suffering and affliction,
[2359.72 → 2362.64] in order to draw closer to God and lament,
[2363.14 → 2364.38] we need a few things.
[2364.48 → 2367.82] We need a new perspective, a perspective of hope.
[2368.08 → 2369.86] We need a posture of hope,
[2369.96 → 2372.12] and we need to hold on to the promises of hope.
[2372.36 → 2375.90] So that's our outline, and we will look at each one of these.
[2375.90 → 2378.64] We'll begin with the perspective of hope.
[2380.26 → 2384.38] And so Jeremiah, in this passage, gets a new perspective.
[2385.18 → 2387.64] And we're going to see a few things here in our passage.
[2387.84 → 2390.40] So let's begin in verses 19 to 20.
[2391.40 → 2392.34] It says this,
[2392.34 → 2410.28] So the first thing to notice is,
[2410.28 → 2414.62] it's not hard to remember hardship, is it?
[2415.82 → 2419.20] It's not very hard for us to remember suffering,
[2419.30 → 2422.14] those days or those seasons in our lives
[2422.14 → 2425.74] when we faced struggles and suffering.
[2426.22 → 2428.84] Jeremiah says it's left a bitterness,
[2429.60 → 2431.22] a bitter taste in his mouth.
[2431.22 → 2434.30] And it's interesting, I was thinking about this,
[2434.60 → 2438.80] the Chinese word, the verb, to suffer,
[2439.04 → 2441.70] is literally to eat bitterness.
[2443.36 → 2447.00] And so, you know, often, on those worst days,
[2447.12 → 2448.32] those worst seasons of life,
[2448.42 → 2452.84] there are sights and sounds and smells
[2452.84 → 2457.32] that we associate with that day or that season.
[2457.32 → 2461.42] And then emotions that then will swell to the surface
[2461.42 → 2463.00] of our hearts and our minds.
[2463.90 → 2465.98] And that's why he says about his affliction,
[2466.36 → 2468.48] I well remember it.
[2468.94 → 2471.14] It is vivid to him.
[2471.14 → 2477.12] But just then, when his soul is downcast, as it says,
[2477.68 → 2480.94] his perspective, we find, widens.
[2481.66 → 2483.60] And he remembers something else.
[2483.70 → 2485.24] He remembers not just the suffering,
[2485.76 → 2487.64] but he remembers God.
[2488.66 → 2491.88] So in verse 21, he goes on and says this,
[2492.32 → 2496.34] Yet this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope.
[2496.34 → 2501.00] And that little phrase, I call to mind,
[2501.48 → 2503.20] this is where it's sometimes helpful
[2503.20 → 2504.84] to go into the original language.
[2505.24 → 2508.92] A more literal translation of that would be,
[2509.32 → 2511.94] I cause this to return to my heart.
[2513.32 → 2514.48] Isn't that beautiful?
[2515.64 → 2518.62] I cause this to return to my heart.
[2518.98 → 2521.06] And therefore, I have hope.
[2521.90 → 2522.04] Right?
[2522.12 → 2522.82] That is so lovely.
[2522.82 → 2527.04] And notice that it's an action of the will.
[2527.62 → 2529.26] I cause this to happen.
[2529.82 → 2532.54] It's something that he has to choose to do.
[2533.98 → 2537.78] He makes this come back into his conscious thinking
[2537.78 → 2541.44] to change his whole perspective.
[2543.08 → 2545.60] And what is then this thing he calls to mind?
[2545.72 → 2546.38] It's this.
[2546.74 → 2548.24] Verses 22 and 23.
[2548.92 → 2552.28] And here, we're going to read the ESV translation.
[2552.28 → 2554.78] I think we're a little bit more familiar with this language.
[2555.92 → 2556.38] It says,
[2556.94 → 2559.34] The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[2559.56 → 2561.74] His mercies never come to an end.
[2562.10 → 2563.66] They are new every morning.
[2564.22 → 2566.32] Great is your faithfulness.
[2570.16 → 2572.14] Grammar is a beautiful thing.
[2573.72 → 2573.98] Amen?
[2574.72 → 2575.30] I don't know.
[2575.30 → 2577.06] When I was in university,
[2577.42 → 2579.98] I took Latin as my language requirement.
[2580.42 → 2582.48] I could have studied Spanish
[2582.48 → 2584.96] and learned how to order tacos in Spanish.
[2585.42 → 2587.96] But instead, I spent my day struggling to read Ovid.
[2588.96 → 2590.26] But my Latin professor,
[2590.54 → 2592.08] he was previously a math teacher.
[2592.74 → 2594.70] And he loved the beauty of math.
[2595.02 → 2596.86] But then he fell in love with languages,
[2597.04 → 2598.00] and Latin in particular,
[2598.38 → 2600.22] because of the beauty of grammar.
[2600.22 → 2604.68] So what do we find here in verse 23?
[2606.12 → 2607.70] Well, up to this point,
[2608.28 → 2609.60] Jeremiah has been saying,
[2609.94 → 2611.44] The Lord does this.
[2611.62 → 2613.40] The Lord does that.
[2613.84 → 2615.76] And he's lamenting the suffering
[2615.76 → 2617.30] that he's experiencing,
[2617.56 → 2619.28] and that he sees God's hand doing.
[2620.64 → 2623.68] But then he causes him something.
[2623.88 → 2626.24] He causes something to return to his heart.
[2626.24 → 2631.40] He recalls what he knows is true,
[2632.52 → 2635.00] which is that the steadfast love of the Lord
[2635.00 → 2635.78] never ceases.
[2636.00 → 2637.60] His mercies never come to an end.
[2637.82 → 2639.32] And as he recalls that,
[2639.76 → 2642.78] he shifts from talking about God in the third person
[2642.78 → 2646.32] to addressing God in the second person.
[2646.58 → 2647.32] And he says,
[2647.46 → 2650.38] Great is your faithfulness.
[2652.04 → 2652.82] Do you see what he's doing?
[2652.82 → 2656.52] He goes from talking about all this pain
[2656.52 → 2657.48] that God has caused.
[2657.90 → 2660.62] He remembers the steadfast love of the Lord
[2660.62 → 2661.36] never ceases.
[2662.42 → 2662.96] And then he says,
[2663.08 → 2664.58] Great is your faithfulness.
[2665.80 → 2667.02] You see, it works.
[2667.74 → 2669.26] What he did has worked.
[2669.38 → 2672.16] He shifted his perspective from his suffering
[2672.16 → 2673.98] to who God is,
[2674.56 → 2676.46] that God is a God of covenant love.
[2676.80 → 2677.74] And then what happens?
[2678.44 → 2680.14] He starts praying.
[2680.14 → 2682.84] He starts talking to God again.
[2682.94 → 2685.06] He's not talking about God.
[2685.72 → 2687.80] Now he's talking to God.
[2690.96 → 2692.10] That's the beauty of grammar.
[2693.54 → 2695.20] Now there's another hymn writer.
[2695.62 → 2698.26] It's a man named Thomas Chisholm
[2698.26 → 2700.62] who lived a number of years ago,
[2700.70 → 2702.32] I think in the early 1900s.
[2702.42 → 2703.16] He was a teacher.
[2703.32 → 2705.40] He was a poet and a minister for a time.
[2706.08 → 2707.14] And he also,
[2707.14 → 2707.88] you know,
[2707.98 → 2709.02] if you dig into the background
[2709.02 → 2710.20] of a lot of these hymns,
[2710.38 → 2713.08] they often come from suffering.
[2714.00 → 2715.54] He had a really hard life.
[2715.74 → 2717.10] He was chronically ill.
[2717.20 → 2718.58] This guy had just,
[2718.96 → 2719.94] he was never healthy
[2719.94 → 2720.94] through his childhood,
[2721.14 → 2721.80] his adolescence,
[2721.88 → 2722.46] into adulthood.
[2722.92 → 2723.92] Never a healthy guy.
[2724.78 → 2726.34] And Lamentations chapter 3
[2726.34 → 2729.02] became precious to him.
[2729.02 → 2730.34] In fact,
[2730.52 → 2732.12] it became so precious to him
[2732.12 → 2733.36] that he wrote a hymn
[2733.36 → 2735.54] based on these verses.
[2736.62 → 2738.22] And we sang it already this morning.
[2738.98 → 2739.40] It's the hymn,
[2739.54 → 2741.04] Great is Thy Faithfulness.
[2742.82 → 2744.64] And so instead of growing
[2744.64 → 2746.40] more and more bitter
[2746.40 → 2748.16] as a result of his suffering,
[2748.52 → 2750.40] which is so easy for us to do,
[2751.50 → 2753.70] he called to his heart
[2753.70 → 2756.46] the truth of God's steadfast love
[2756.46 → 2757.86] and his faithfulness.
[2757.96 → 2759.56] And he wrote a hymn about it
[2759.56 → 2760.50] so that he,
[2760.92 → 2763.10] so that we can remember it as well
[2763.10 → 2764.90] as we sing it.
[2766.04 → 2767.48] And that's what Jeremiah does.
[2767.58 → 2768.74] He calls to mind
[2768.74 → 2769.76] God's care
[2769.76 → 2771.02] and God's love.
[2771.36 → 2773.06] And it leads him
[2773.06 → 2775.32] to draw close to God.
[2775.98 → 2776.84] It leads him
[2776.84 → 2777.90] to kind of be renewed
[2777.90 → 2779.30] in his relationship with God
[2779.30 → 2780.40] as he addresses God
[2780.40 → 2780.88] in prayer
[2780.88 → 2781.98] and in worship.
[2782.88 → 2783.62] And so Jeremiah,
[2783.62 → 2785.42] he gets a new perspective.
[2786.46 → 2788.44] Now that leads to the second thing
[2788.44 → 2789.34] we see in our passage,
[2789.66 → 2791.12] which is a new posture,
[2791.42 → 2792.56] a posture of hope.
[2794.72 → 2795.64] Next slide, Doug.
[2798.04 → 2799.64] So Jeremiah, right,
[2799.68 → 2801.48] he's gone through this important shift
[2801.48 → 2802.54] in his perspective,
[2802.90 → 2805.06] but now he's got to live it out.
[2805.52 → 2806.46] He's got to live
[2806.46 → 2809.16] into this renewed perspective.
[2809.52 → 2810.60] And he does so
[2810.60 → 2812.18] by adopting a certain posture.
[2812.18 → 2813.82] It's a posture
[2813.82 → 2815.34] of silence
[2815.34 → 2816.46] and of waiting.
[2817.84 → 2819.02] So let's see
[2819.02 → 2819.92] what he says
[2819.92 → 2821.24] as we continue
[2821.24 → 2822.78] in our passage
[2822.78 → 2824.06] in verse 24.
[2825.64 → 2827.38] I say to myself,
[2828.34 → 2830.10] the Lord is my portion,
[2830.74 → 2832.08] therefore I will wait for him.
[2834.04 → 2835.42] Now throughout the Bible,
[2835.74 → 2836.58] we're often told
[2836.58 → 2838.10] that the people of God
[2838.10 → 2840.12] are God's portion.
[2840.12 → 2840.60] Right?
[2841.32 → 2842.04] So for example,
[2842.20 → 2843.54] Deuteronomy chapter 32
[2843.54 → 2844.48] verse 9 says,
[2845.20 → 2846.74] for the Lord's portion
[2846.74 → 2848.20] is his people.
[2850.06 → 2851.68] And it's on that basis
[2851.68 → 2853.82] that we belong to God,
[2853.88 → 2855.28] that we are his portion,
[2855.54 → 2857.50] that the Lord has taken us
[2857.50 → 2858.08] to himself,
[2858.20 → 2859.48] that we can then in turn
[2859.48 → 2860.16] say,
[2860.48 → 2861.64] the Lord is my portion.
[2862.74 → 2864.12] We belong to God
[2864.12 → 2865.12] and so we can say,
[2865.48 → 2865.66] well,
[2865.72 → 2867.04] the Lord belongs to me.
[2867.98 → 2869.50] He is my ultimate good.
[2869.50 → 2871.48] He is my portion.
[2873.16 → 2874.24] And that gives us
[2874.24 → 2875.20] so much hope
[2875.20 → 2876.00] in the midst
[2876.00 → 2876.56] of our suffering
[2876.56 → 2877.14] that no matter
[2877.14 → 2878.06] what we're facing,
[2878.92 → 2880.44] I belong to the Lord
[2880.44 → 2881.90] and he belongs to me.
[2884.98 → 2886.20] And because God
[2886.20 → 2887.56] has made us his own,
[2888.22 → 2889.32] we belong to him.
[2889.66 → 2890.18] And that's why
[2890.18 → 2891.10] Jeremiah says,
[2891.24 → 2891.54] therefore,
[2892.02 → 2893.56] I will wait for him.
[2894.16 → 2895.02] I'm secure
[2895.02 → 2896.82] in this relationship
[2896.82 → 2898.06] where God is faithful
[2898.06 → 2899.04] and I belong to him
[2899.04 → 2900.30] and he is my portion
[2900.30 → 2901.72] and so I'm going to wait
[2901.72 → 2903.36] for the Lord.
[2904.80 → 2905.82] And then we read
[2905.82 → 2907.12] in verse 26,
[2908.22 → 2908.96] it is good
[2908.96 → 2910.30] to wait quietly
[2910.30 → 2911.22] for the salvation
[2911.22 → 2911.86] of the Lord.
[2912.92 → 2914.32] So what's happening here?
[2914.32 → 2916.30] I think what is happening
[2916.30 → 2917.18] is that Jeremiah,
[2917.48 → 2919.62] he gains that renewed perspective,
[2919.80 → 2920.74] a widened perspective,
[2921.24 → 2922.74] he remembers who God is,
[2923.20 → 2924.48] he calls it to mind,
[2924.54 → 2925.10] to his heart,
[2925.40 → 2926.40] that leads him
[2926.40 → 2927.42] to a renewed posture,
[2928.08 → 2929.06] a new way
[2929.06 → 2932.14] of being in the world,
[2932.22 → 2933.12] a new way of engaging
[2933.12 → 2934.00] with his suffering,
[2934.10 → 2935.18] what's happening around him,
[2935.32 → 2936.44] a new way of understanding
[2936.44 → 2937.04] his suffering
[2937.04 → 2938.44] and it's a posture
[2938.44 → 2939.48] of quiet waiting.
[2939.48 → 2942.36] Now this,
[2943.38 → 2943.96] of course,
[2944.08 → 2944.64] doesn't mean
[2944.64 → 2945.86] that we assume
[2945.86 → 2946.42] a posture
[2946.42 → 2947.60] of prayerlessness.
[2948.24 → 2949.36] Waiting doesn't mean
[2949.36 → 2951.12] we stop praying to God,
[2951.18 → 2951.64] it doesn't mean
[2951.64 → 2953.10] that we don't share
[2953.10 → 2954.14] our griefs and struggles
[2954.14 → 2955.20] with other believers.
[2955.60 → 2956.68] Far from it.
[2957.66 → 2958.10] Rather,
[2958.24 → 2958.72] what it means
[2958.72 → 2960.04] is that we wait patiently
[2960.04 → 2962.62] in view of who God is
[2962.62 → 2964.24] and what he has promised
[2964.24 → 2964.92] to do.
[2965.82 → 2966.74] We trust
[2966.74 → 2968.16] that God is sovereign
[2968.16 → 2969.54] and that he
[2969.54 → 2970.86] is the God
[2970.86 → 2972.04] who has saved us
[2972.04 → 2973.80] because we belong to him.
[2975.24 → 2975.88] And so we see
[2975.88 → 2976.36] that waiting
[2976.36 → 2978.22] is not a passive thing
[2978.22 → 2978.72] at all.
[2978.82 → 2979.38] It's actually
[2979.38 → 2981.30] an active resting
[2981.30 → 2982.92] on the goodness
[2982.92 → 2983.98] of God.
[2985.32 → 2986.50] It's a movement
[2986.50 → 2988.28] towards God.
[2989.92 → 2990.56] So whether,
[2990.72 → 2990.84] you know,
[2990.86 → 2992.02] waiting for God's healing,
[2992.18 → 2993.26] whether in our own lives
[2993.26 → 2994.02] or in our families
[2994.02 → 2994.82] or in the world,
[2995.20 → 2996.50] it does not make us
[2996.50 → 2997.46] complacent.
[2998.16 → 2999.86] It makes us people
[2999.86 → 3002.68] who run to the Lord
[3002.68 → 3004.16] for his mercy
[3004.16 → 3005.78] because we belong to him.
[3007.44 → 3009.02] And what we need
[3009.02 → 3010.06] to take away from this
[3010.06 → 3010.92] is that waiting
[3010.92 → 3012.42] is a part of lament.
[3012.92 → 3013.12] Right?
[3013.16 → 3013.62] We're learning
[3013.62 → 3014.12] what does it mean
[3014.12 → 3014.58] to lament.
[3015.20 → 3015.96] That's what we're doing
[3015.96 → 3016.64] in this season.
[3017.60 → 3018.66] And that we're learning
[3018.66 → 3019.34] that waiting
[3019.34 → 3021.70] is an important,
[3022.08 → 3023.48] central part of lament.
[3024.72 → 3025.24] Because,
[3025.62 → 3026.22] think of this,
[3026.22 → 3027.94] one way that we
[3027.94 → 3028.72] as Christians
[3028.72 → 3029.68] are to respond
[3029.68 → 3030.24] to the suffering
[3030.24 → 3030.84] of the world
[3030.84 → 3032.34] is through action.
[3032.90 → 3033.12] Right?
[3033.18 → 3033.86] We are called
[3033.86 → 3035.20] to go out
[3035.20 → 3035.90] into the world
[3035.90 → 3036.74] as Christ did,
[3036.84 → 3037.88] to roll up our sleeves
[3037.88 → 3038.84] and to seek
[3038.84 → 3040.16] to bring healing
[3040.16 → 3041.48] to brokenness
[3041.48 → 3043.02] wherever we can.
[3043.02 → 3047.68] there is a place
[3047.68 → 3049.28] for social activism.
[3049.90 → 3050.70] But activism
[3050.70 → 3052.04] is not a replacement
[3052.04 → 3052.96] for waiting.
[3054.42 → 3055.36] And if any of us
[3055.36 → 3055.98] think that
[3055.98 → 3057.00] we have found
[3057.00 → 3058.28] a way to respond
[3058.28 → 3059.00] to suffering
[3059.00 → 3060.00] that doesn't involve
[3060.00 → 3061.80] waiting on the Lord
[3061.80 → 3062.52] and patience
[3062.52 → 3063.54] for him to act,
[3064.04 → 3065.18] then we haven't really
[3065.18 → 3066.20] learned Christian lament.
[3068.08 → 3068.20] Right?
[3068.26 → 3069.16] Waiting is always
[3069.16 → 3070.16] a part of the equation
[3070.16 → 3070.52] here.
[3070.86 → 3071.86] Because ultimately
[3071.86 → 3072.86] it is the Lord
[3072.86 → 3074.04] who is the one
[3074.04 → 3074.60] who saves.
[3075.08 → 3075.86] And it is the Lord
[3075.86 → 3076.44] who is the one
[3076.44 → 3076.96] who heals.
[3079.84 → 3080.82] And so here's a question
[3080.82 → 3081.84] I want us to
[3081.84 → 3083.48] maybe take home
[3083.48 → 3083.90] with us
[3083.90 → 3084.54] and think about
[3084.54 → 3085.06] this week.
[3085.68 → 3086.28] And it's this.
[3086.66 → 3087.78] Where in your life
[3087.78 → 3088.66] are you waiting
[3088.66 → 3089.80] for God
[3089.80 → 3090.62] to intervene?
[3093.62 → 3094.92] Where is your
[3094.92 → 3096.32] place of waiting?
[3096.32 → 3099.24] And are you
[3099.24 → 3099.72] willing
[3099.72 → 3101.58] to assume
[3101.58 → 3102.24] a posture
[3102.24 → 3103.28] of waiting
[3103.28 → 3104.76] for God's
[3104.76 → 3105.30] salvation
[3105.30 → 3106.86] and trust?
[3109.02 → 3109.86] Where are you
[3109.86 → 3110.14] waiting?
[3110.28 → 3110.76] Where do you
[3110.76 → 3111.14] need
[3111.14 → 3112.52] to learn
[3112.52 → 3113.36] to take on
[3113.36 → 3113.94] this posture
[3113.94 → 3114.42] of waiting
[3114.42 → 3115.02] for the Lord?
[3116.34 → 3117.16] Now third
[3117.16 → 3117.70] and finally
[3117.70 → 3118.38] we have
[3118.38 → 3119.16] the promise
[3119.16 → 3119.80] of hope.
[3122.02 → 3122.42] And so
[3122.42 → 3122.78] kind of
[3122.78 → 3124.00] a way
[3124.00 → 3124.62] to think
[3124.62 → 3125.16] about this
[3125.16 → 3126.30] is the
[3126.30 → 3126.80] book
[3126.80 → 3127.54] The Pilgrim's
[3127.54 → 3127.88] Progress
[3127.88 → 3129.30] by John Bunyan.
[3130.30 → 3131.18] It's an
[3131.18 → 3131.84] allegory
[3131.84 → 3132.12] of the
[3132.12 → 3132.86] Christian life
[3132.86 → 3133.36] where the
[3133.36 → 3134.14] main character
[3134.14 → 3135.24] very kind
[3135.24 → 3135.88] of obviously
[3135.88 → 3136.72] Christian
[3136.72 → 3137.74] is his name
[3137.74 → 3138.66] he journeys
[3138.66 → 3139.98] from the
[3139.98 → 3140.64] city of
[3140.64 → 3141.20] destruction
[3141.20 → 3141.88] to the
[3141.88 → 3142.76] celestial city.
[3143.64 → 3144.18] And along
[3144.18 → 3144.56] the way
[3144.56 → 3145.20] he meets
[3145.20 → 3145.80] various
[3145.80 → 3146.36] characters
[3146.36 → 3146.96] he finds
[3146.96 → 3147.26] himself
[3147.26 → 3147.70] in various
[3147.70 → 3148.28] situations.
[3149.28 → 3149.68] And all
[3149.68 → 3149.90] of them
[3149.90 → 3150.18] are meant
[3150.18 → 3150.74] to illustrate
[3150.74 → 3151.40] some aspects
[3151.40 → 3151.62] of the
[3151.62 → 3152.10] Christian life.
[3152.22 → 3152.40] It's an
[3152.40 → 3152.74] allegory.
[3153.26 → 3153.58] Well at
[3153.58 → 3154.16] one point
[3154.16 → 3155.90] on Christian's
[3155.90 → 3156.48] pilgrimage
[3156.48 → 3157.04] to the
[3157.04 → 3157.76] celestial city
[3157.76 → 3158.72] he and
[3158.72 → 3159.56] his companion
[3159.56 → 3160.24] named
[3160.24 → 3160.72] Hopeful
[3160.72 → 3161.82] they get
[3161.82 → 3162.12] off the
[3162.12 → 3162.52] path.
[3163.54 → 3163.96] One thing
[3163.96 → 3164.26] leads to
[3164.26 → 3164.64] another
[3164.64 → 3165.30] they are
[3165.30 → 3165.90] seized
[3165.90 → 3166.42] by this
[3166.42 → 3167.02] menacing
[3167.02 → 3167.64] figure
[3167.64 → 3168.50] called
[3168.50 → 3169.52] Giant
[3169.52 → 3170.24] Despair
[3170.24 → 3171.80] who throws
[3171.80 → 3172.32] them into
[3172.32 → 3172.92] the dungeon
[3172.92 → 3173.78] in his
[3173.78 → 3174.28] castle
[3174.28 → 3175.02] called
[3175.02 → 3175.46] Doubting
[3175.46 → 3175.86] Castle.
[3176.96 → 3177.28] And then
[3177.28 → 3177.76] during their
[3177.76 → 3178.14] time as
[3178.14 → 3178.56] prisoners
[3178.56 → 3179.16] in
[3179.16 → 3179.74] Doubting
[3179.74 → 3180.34] Castle
[3180.34 → 3181.46] Giant
[3181.46 → 3182.14] Despair
[3182.14 → 3183.18] make sure
[3183.18 → 3184.24] that they
[3184.24 → 3184.92] experience
[3184.92 → 3185.38] despair.
[3186.20 → 3187.04] He beats
[3187.04 → 3187.30] them.
[3188.14 → 3189.68] He even
[3189.68 → 3190.98] counsels them
[3190.98 → 3191.54] to take
[3191.54 → 3191.96] their own
[3191.96 → 3192.38] lives.
[3193.42 → 3193.84] He makes
[3193.84 → 3194.34] sure that
[3194.34 → 3194.82] they are
[3194.82 → 3195.24] in the
[3195.24 → 3195.74] depths of
[3195.74 → 3196.12] woe.
[3197.30 → 3197.76] But then
[3197.76 → 3198.30] even while
[3198.30 → 3198.70] they are at
[3198.70 → 3199.14] their lowest
[3199.14 → 3199.66] point
[3199.66 → 3200.18] Christian
[3200.18 → 3200.76] remembers
[3200.76 → 3201.58] a key
[3201.58 → 3202.40] that he
[3202.40 → 3202.70] has been
[3202.70 → 3203.10] carrying
[3203.10 → 3203.52] in his
[3203.52 → 3203.84] pocket.
[3204.76 → 3205.10] And the
[3205.10 → 3205.52] key has
[3205.52 → 3206.08] a name
[3206.08 → 3206.68] and the
[3206.68 → 3207.66] key is
[3207.66 → 3208.12] called
[3208.12 → 3209.32] promise.
[3209.32 → 3211.52] promise.
[3212.34 → 3212.92] And with
[3212.92 → 3213.62] this key
[3213.62 → 3214.74] of promise
[3214.74 → 3215.52] Christian
[3215.52 → 3216.04] and hopeful
[3216.04 → 3216.92] are able
[3216.92 → 3218.44] to open
[3218.44 → 3218.90] the doors
[3218.90 → 3219.16] of the
[3219.16 → 3219.48] dungeon
[3219.48 → 3220.50] and open
[3220.50 → 3221.38] each door
[3221.38 → 3222.58] to escape
[3222.58 → 3222.92] from
[3222.92 → 3223.24] Doubting
[3223.24 → 3223.62] Castle
[3223.62 → 3224.30] and to
[3224.30 → 3224.92] return
[3224.92 → 3225.16] to the
[3225.16 → 3225.60] path on
[3225.60 → 3225.98] their way
[3225.98 → 3226.60] to the
[3226.60 → 3226.90] celestial
[3226.90 → 3227.34] city.
[3228.28 → 3228.90] Well it's
[3228.90 → 3229.38] an allegory
[3229.38 → 3229.72] that's very
[3229.72 → 3230.18] kind of on
[3230.18 → 3230.64] the nose.
[3232.38 → 3233.14] And what
[3233.14 → 3233.60] we learn
[3233.60 → 3234.34] though is
[3234.34 → 3235.12] that when
[3235.12 → 3235.72] we find
[3235.72 → 3236.26] ourselves
[3236.26 → 3237.14] like Jeremiah
[3237.14 → 3238.66] like Christian
[3238.66 → 3239.16] and hopeful
[3239.16 → 3241.02] in the
[3241.02 → 3241.56] depths of
[3241.56 → 3242.10] despair
[3242.10 → 3243.96] the secret
[3243.96 → 3244.62] to drawing
[3244.62 → 3245.28] closer to
[3245.28 → 3245.80] God
[3245.80 → 3246.96] is to
[3246.96 → 3247.32] hold
[3247.32 → 3247.80] tightly
[3247.80 → 3248.16] to the
[3248.16 → 3248.66] promises
[3248.66 → 3250.10] of hope.
[3252.28 → 3253.36] Now if
[3253.36 → 3254.04] you recall
[3254.04 → 3255.18] in Lamentations
[3255.18 → 3256.62] each
[3256.62 → 3258.04] chapter
[3258.04 → 3258.86] is written
[3258.86 → 3259.92] as an
[3259.92 → 3260.42] acrostic.
[3261.14 → 3262.00] It's an
[3262.00 → 3262.28] acrostic
[3262.28 → 3262.68] poetry.
[3262.92 → 3263.52] So in
[3263.52 → 3264.30] chapters 1
[3264.30 → 3264.92] and 2
[3264.92 → 3265.82] remember we
[3265.82 → 3266.38] have 22
[3266.38 → 3267.08] verses and
[3267.08 → 3267.74] that's because
[3267.74 → 3268.74] there are
[3268.74 → 3269.64] 22 letters
[3269.64 → 3269.96] in the
[3269.96 → 3270.16] Hebrew
[3270.16 → 3270.52] alphabet.
[3270.84 → 3271.28] So one
[3271.28 → 3271.98] letter for
[3271.98 → 3272.52] each verse
[3272.52 → 3273.16] an acrostic.
[3274.08 → 3274.64] But chapter
[3274.64 → 3275.76] 3 has
[3275.76 → 3276.36] how many
[3276.36 → 3276.72] verses?
[3277.58 → 3277.90] Did you
[3277.90 → 3278.24] notice?
[3279.70 → 3280.34] 66.
[3281.70 → 3282.08] Okay for
[3282.08 → 3282.40] all of you
[3282.40 → 3283.08] math whizzes
[3283.08 → 3285.02] 22 times
[3285.02 → 3285.80] 3 is
[3285.80 → 3287.52] even I
[3287.52 → 3287.74] can do
[3287.74 → 3288.04] this one
[3288.04 → 3289.12] 66.
[3290.20 → 3291.20] So with
[3291.20 → 3291.96] chapter 3
[3291.96 → 3292.76] the acrostic
[3292.76 → 3294.28] is A
[3294.28 → 3294.52] A
[3294.52 → 3294.58] A
[3294.58 → 3295.44] B
[3295.44 → 3295.74] B
[3295.74 → 3296.00] B
[3296.00 → 3296.40] C
[3296.40 → 3296.58] C
[3296.58 → 3296.78] C
[3296.78 → 3297.20] 3
[3297.20 → 3297.66] verses
[3297.66 → 3298.06] per
[3298.06 → 3298.94] each
[3298.94 → 3299.26] letter.
[3300.04 → 3300.46] 66
[3300.46 → 3300.92] verses.
[3302.24 → 3302.70] Now why
[3302.70 → 3303.20] is that?
[3303.48 → 3303.82] This is
[3303.82 → 3304.30] intentional.
[3305.34 → 3306.12] It's because
[3306.12 → 3306.90] in Hebrew
[3306.90 → 3308.58] poetry the
[3308.58 → 3310.44] climax is
[3310.44 → 3311.04] not at the
[3311.04 → 3312.48] end but
[3312.48 → 3312.78] in the
[3312.78 → 3313.00] middle.
[3313.88 → 3314.56] It's different
[3314.56 → 3315.04] than the way
[3315.04 → 3315.60] we think
[3315.60 → 3316.08] in the
[3316.08 → 3316.38] West.
[3317.10 → 3317.24] The
[3317.24 → 3317.60] climax
[3317.60 → 3318.02] doesn't
[3318.02 → 3318.26] come at
[3318.26 → 3318.82] the end
[3318.82 → 3319.38] it comes
[3319.38 → 3319.66] in the
[3319.66 → 3319.92] middle.
[3320.72 → 3320.92] And so
[3320.92 → 3321.20] what we
[3321.20 → 3322.18] find in
[3322.18 → 3323.20] verses
[3323.20 → 3324.12] 31,
[3324.36 → 3325.06] 32,
[3325.40 → 3326.74] 33 is
[3326.74 → 3327.02] that they
[3327.02 → 3327.48] are right
[3327.48 → 3327.78] in the
[3327.78 → 3328.30] middle of
[3328.30 → 3329.10] chapter 3
[3329.10 → 3329.68] which is
[3329.68 → 3330.06] right in
[3330.06 → 3330.52] the middle
[3330.52 → 3330.96] of the
[3330.96 → 3331.80] book of
[3331.80 → 3332.44] lamentations.
[3333.38 → 3334.20] In other
[3334.20 → 3335.30] words this
[3335.30 → 3335.86] is the
[3335.86 → 3336.66] heart of
[3336.66 → 3336.96] lament.
[3338.14 → 3338.74] This is
[3338.74 → 3339.24] the exact
[3339.24 → 3340.52] centre of
[3340.52 → 3341.12] the entire
[3341.12 → 3342.24] book of
[3342.24 → 3342.88] lamentations
[3342.88 → 3343.26] and in
[3343.26 → 3343.98] Hebrew poetry
[3343.98 → 3344.94] the centre
[3344.94 → 3345.98] point is
[3345.98 → 3346.48] the key
[3346.48 → 3346.90] point.
[3347.90 → 3348.32] In other
[3348.32 → 3348.70] words if
[3348.70 → 3349.12] you get
[3349.12 → 3350.32] this if
[3350.32 → 3350.90] you then
[3350.90 → 3351.34] you get
[3351.34 → 3351.66] the book
[3351.66 → 3351.78] of
[3351.78 → 3352.34] lamentations
[3352.34 → 3353.18] and you
[3353.18 → 3353.80] understand
[3353.80 → 3354.88] what it
[3354.88 → 3355.28] means to
[3355.28 → 3355.54] lament.
[3356.50 → 3357.22] So what
[3357.22 → 3357.68] is the
[3357.68 → 3358.04] central
[3358.04 → 3359.16] message of
[3359.16 → 3359.42] the book
[3359.42 → 3359.56] of
[3359.56 → 3360.10] lamentations?
[3360.26 → 3360.54] Let's
[3360.54 → 3361.04] read it
[3361.04 → 3361.78] and let's
[3361.78 → 3362.28] learn a few
[3362.28 → 3362.98] things from
[3362.98 → 3363.46] these verses.
[3363.92 → 3364.56] Verse 31
[3364.56 → 3367.04] For no
[3367.04 → 3367.94] one is
[3367.94 → 3369.00] cast off
[3369.00 → 3370.10] by the
[3370.10 → 3370.44] Lord
[3370.44 → 3371.60] forever.
[3373.72 → 3374.48] This is
[3374.48 → 3374.78] what God
[3374.78 → 3375.12] wants you
[3375.12 → 3375.44] to know.
[3376.64 → 3377.20] Point
[3377.20 → 3378.54] one all
[3378.54 → 3379.32] suffering
[3379.32 → 3380.26] is
[3380.26 → 3380.86] temporary.
[3382.32 → 3383.20] This is
[3383.20 → 3383.64] the promise
[3383.64 → 3384.02] of God
[3384.02 → 3384.36] to us
[3384.36 → 3384.60] in his
[3384.60 → 3384.82] word.
[3385.18 → 3385.38] All
[3385.38 → 3385.74] suffering
[3385.74 → 3385.94] is
[3385.94 → 3386.30] temporary.
[3387.78 → 3388.00] Verse
[3388.00 → 3388.56] 32
[3388.56 → 3390.64] Though
[3390.64 → 3391.50] he brings
[3391.50 → 3392.06] grief
[3392.06 → 3393.66] he will
[3393.66 → 3394.48] show
[3394.48 → 3395.42] compassion.
[3396.16 → 3396.90] So great
[3396.90 → 3397.54] is his
[3397.54 → 3397.90] unfailing
[3397.90 → 3398.28] love.
[3399.94 → 3400.32] Point
[3400.32 → 3400.70] two
[3400.70 → 3401.64] God
[3401.64 → 3402.56] may bring
[3402.56 → 3402.96] hardship
[3402.96 → 3403.54] into your
[3403.54 → 3403.96] life
[3403.96 → 3405.06] as a
[3405.06 → 3405.54] means of
[3405.54 → 3405.96] correction
[3405.96 → 3406.76] or testing
[3406.76 → 3407.90] but he
[3407.90 → 3408.38] will never
[3408.38 → 3409.68] only do
[3409.68 → 3410.14] that.
[3410.56 → 3410.82] He will
[3410.82 → 3411.74] also bring
[3411.74 → 3412.74] the gentleness
[3412.74 → 3413.16] of his
[3413.16 → 3413.66] compassion
[3413.66 → 3414.22] to you
[3414.22 → 3415.36] because he
[3415.36 → 3415.92] loves you
[3415.92 → 3416.52] and he
[3416.52 → 3416.78] cannot
[3416.78 → 3417.70] stop
[3417.70 → 3418.60] loving you
[3418.60 → 3419.54] because he
[3419.54 → 3419.82] is a
[3419.82 → 3420.26] God of
[3420.26 → 3420.54] great
[3420.54 → 3420.92] unfailing
[3420.92 → 3421.36] love.
[3422.94 → 3423.10] Then
[3423.10 → 3423.48] point
[3423.48 → 3424.00] then
[3424.00 → 3424.28] verse
[3424.28 → 3425.22] 33
[3425.22 → 3426.72] For
[3426.72 → 3427.42] he does
[3427.42 → 3427.72] not
[3427.72 → 3428.44] willingly
[3428.44 → 3428.88] bring
[3428.88 → 3429.28] affliction
[3429.28 → 3429.72] or grief
[3429.72 → 3430.58] to anyone.
[3430.58 → 3433.10] So
[3433.10 → 3433.38] point
[3433.38 → 3433.74] three
[3433.74 → 3434.42] when
[3434.42 → 3434.82] God
[3434.82 → 3435.12] brings
[3435.12 → 3435.56] correction
[3435.56 → 3436.34] he does
[3436.34 → 3436.80] not
[3436.80 → 3437.20] do it
[3437.20 → 3437.58] from his
[3437.58 → 3437.94] heart.
[3439.20 → 3439.84] Anger
[3439.84 → 3440.90] and judgment
[3440.90 → 3442.42] are not
[3442.42 → 3443.26] God's
[3443.26 → 3444.62] not the
[3444.62 → 3445.50] fundamental
[3445.50 → 3446.42] disposition
[3446.42 → 3446.94] of his
[3446.94 → 3447.26] heart
[3447.26 → 3449.00] towards you.
[3450.06 → 3450.62] And there's
[3450.62 → 3451.08] an important
[3451.08 → 3451.88] truth here
[3451.88 → 3453.24] that we
[3453.24 → 3453.72] should not
[3453.72 → 3454.16] equate
[3454.16 → 3454.68] God's
[3454.68 → 3455.50] love
[3455.50 → 3456.12] with
[3456.12 → 3456.86] God's
[3456.86 → 3457.30] anger.
[3458.10 → 3458.50] God
[3458.50 → 3459.40] is love
[3459.40 → 3459.84] that's who
[3459.84 → 3460.24] he is
[3460.24 → 3460.50] and his
[3460.50 → 3460.86] character.
[3461.26 → 3461.42] God
[3461.42 → 3462.12] is not
[3462.12 → 3462.84] anger
[3462.84 → 3463.56] or judgment.
[3464.10 → 3464.28] God
[3464.28 → 3464.92] becomes
[3464.92 → 3465.38] angry
[3465.38 → 3465.70] he
[3465.70 → 3466.22] enacts
[3466.22 → 3466.64] judgment
[3466.64 → 3467.22] because
[3467.22 → 3467.74] he
[3467.74 → 3468.00] loves
[3468.00 → 3468.38] us.
[3469.74 → 3470.04] So
[3470.04 → 3470.44] God's
[3470.44 → 3470.70] love
[3470.70 → 3470.84] and
[3470.84 → 3471.08] God's
[3471.08 → 3471.34] anger
[3471.34 → 3471.62] they are
[3471.62 → 3471.84] not
[3471.84 → 3472.30] opposed
[3472.30 → 3472.56] to
[3472.56 → 3472.82] each
[3472.82 → 3473.06] other.
[3473.18 → 3473.32] God
[3473.32 → 3473.82] is not
[3473.82 → 3474.80] conflicted
[3474.80 → 3475.00] within
[3475.00 → 3475.54] himself
[3475.54 → 3476.00] like
[3476.00 → 3476.38] us.
[3477.18 → 3477.48] God's
[3477.48 → 3477.88] anger
[3477.88 → 3478.36] is a
[3478.36 → 3478.76] logical
[3478.76 → 3479.44] outworking
[3479.44 → 3479.88] of his
[3479.88 → 3480.28] love
[3480.28 → 3481.28] for a
[3481.28 → 3481.70] world
[3481.70 → 3482.58] that has
[3482.58 → 3482.96] turned
[3482.96 → 3483.68] to violence
[3483.68 → 3483.86] and
[3483.86 → 3484.34] injustice
[3484.34 → 3485.78] and to
[3485.78 → 3486.22] oppression
[3486.22 → 3486.50] and
[3486.50 → 3487.04] exploitation.
[3488.56 → 3488.86] And so
[3488.86 → 3489.10] you know
[3489.10 → 3489.28] what
[3489.28 → 3489.86] sometimes
[3489.86 → 3490.78] our
[3490.78 → 3491.66] experience
[3491.66 → 3492.22] of
[3492.22 → 3492.66] suffering
[3492.66 → 3493.86] comes
[3493.86 → 3494.28] as in
[3494.28 → 3494.60] the case
[3494.60 → 3494.72] of
[3494.72 → 3495.30] lamentations
[3495.30 → 3496.10] because of
[3496.10 → 3496.46] our own
[3496.46 → 3496.72] sin.
[3497.98 → 3498.50] God
[3498.50 → 3499.88] corrects us
[3499.88 → 3500.22] in his
[3500.22 → 3500.60] love.
[3501.70 → 3502.64] Other times
[3502.64 → 3503.20] our suffering
[3503.20 → 3503.88] is because of
[3503.88 → 3504.18] the sin
[3504.18 → 3504.86] of others
[3504.86 → 3506.38] or because
[3506.38 → 3506.76] of just
[3506.76 → 3507.32] the general
[3507.32 → 3508.36] fallenness
[3508.36 → 3509.56] of this
[3509.56 → 3509.90] world.
[3511.36 → 3512.18] But no
[3512.18 → 3512.78] matter what,
[3512.84 → 3513.16] no matter
[3513.16 → 3513.90] whether our
[3513.90 → 3514.30] suffering is
[3514.30 → 3514.56] because of
[3514.56 → 3514.90] our own
[3514.90 → 3515.58] sin or
[3515.58 → 3516.10] just because
[3516.10 → 3516.90] of the
[3516.90 → 3517.26] fall,
[3517.96 → 3518.30] God's
[3518.30 → 3518.90] love for
[3518.90 → 3519.34] us is
[3519.34 → 3520.32] unyielding.
[3520.90 → 3521.16] He will
[3521.16 → 3522.76] never give
[3522.76 → 3523.40] up on us
[3523.40 → 3523.74] no matter
[3523.74 → 3524.18] what we
[3524.18 → 3524.42] do.
[3525.22 → 3525.58] And his
[3525.58 → 3526.08] love for
[3526.08 → 3526.50] us is
[3526.50 → 3527.40] total and
[3527.40 → 3527.92] complete,
[3528.48 → 3529.66] which means
[3529.66 → 3530.06] there is no
[3530.06 → 3531.08] part of
[3531.08 → 3531.74] our hearts
[3531.74 → 3532.04] that he
[3532.04 → 3532.40] does not
[3532.40 → 3532.82] desire.
[3534.56 → 3535.00] And friends,
[3535.10 → 3535.58] we need to
[3535.58 → 3536.12] hear this.
[3536.28 → 3536.82] We need to
[3536.82 → 3537.76] hear this
[3537.76 → 3539.00] central message
[3539.00 → 3540.06] of lamentations.
[3540.76 → 3541.30] And we need,
[3541.40 → 3541.82] some of us,
[3541.88 → 3542.18] we need to
[3542.18 → 3542.70] wrestle with
[3542.70 → 3543.06] this.
[3544.52 → 3545.28] And finally,
[3545.40 → 3545.72] we need to
[3545.72 → 3546.26] believe it.
[3546.70 → 3547.08] And we need
[3547.08 → 3547.70] to trust it.
[3548.42 → 3548.62] Right?
[3548.68 → 3549.46] Because this is
[3549.46 → 3549.90] the heart of
[3549.90 → 3550.48] lamentations.
[3550.76 → 3551.40] This is the
[3551.40 → 3551.74] heart of
[3551.74 → 3552.06] God.
[3553.12 → 3553.36] Right?
[3553.42 → 3553.80] And so at
[3553.80 → 3554.40] the centre
[3554.40 → 3555.24] of this
[3555.24 → 3555.62] book of
[3555.62 → 3556.20] lamentations,
[3556.26 → 3556.54] which is
[3556.54 → 3557.34] just surrounded,
[3557.82 → 3558.58] book ended by
[3558.58 → 3559.66] suffering and
[3559.66 → 3560.20] pain,
[3561.20 → 3561.78] in the centre
[3561.78 → 3562.54] is the promise
[3562.54 → 3563.04] that God
[3563.04 → 3563.64] does not
[3563.64 → 3564.40] have anger
[3564.40 → 3564.84] in his
[3564.84 → 3565.34] heart towards
[3565.34 → 3566.30] you or
[3566.30 → 3566.78] to anyone.
[3568.02 → 3568.40] God's
[3568.40 → 3569.26] heart towards
[3569.26 → 3570.70] you are
[3570.70 → 3571.52] unfailing
[3571.52 → 3571.98] love.
[3572.70 → 3574.34] And we
[3574.34 → 3574.78] need to
[3574.78 → 3576.02] hold on to
[3576.02 → 3576.68] that promise
[3576.68 → 3577.90] in the midst
[3577.90 → 3578.46] of the
[3578.46 → 3578.86] suffering that
[3578.86 → 3579.12] we go
[3579.12 → 3579.34] through.
[3580.74 → 3581.18] You know,
[3581.26 → 3581.70] and we saw
[3581.70 → 3582.54] this clearly,
[3584.30 → 3585.26] the heart
[3585.26 → 3585.94] of God,
[3586.66 → 3587.64] in that
[3587.64 → 3588.38] gospel lesson
[3588.38 → 3588.86] that we read
[3588.86 → 3589.24] earlier,
[3589.76 → 3590.50] in Matthew
[3590.50 → 3591.16] chapter 9.
[3591.86 → 3592.02] Okay,
[3592.10 → 3592.40] Jesus.
[3593.00 → 3593.56] Jesus is
[3593.56 → 3594.98] walking along
[3594.98 → 3595.36] when he
[3595.36 → 3595.90] encounters
[3595.90 → 3596.38] Matthew,
[3596.56 → 3596.92] a tax
[3596.92 → 3597.26] collector.
[3598.84 → 3599.28] Matthew,
[3599.46 → 3599.78] the tax
[3599.78 → 3600.04] collector,
[3600.10 → 3600.40] he was a
[3600.40 → 3600.98] Jewish man,
[3601.16 → 3601.68] he worked
[3601.68 → 3601.96] for the
[3601.96 → 3602.14] Roman
[3602.14 → 3602.62] government,
[3602.70 → 3603.98] he had
[3603.98 → 3604.84] turned on
[3604.84 → 3605.44] his own
[3605.44 → 3606.04] neighbours
[3606.04 → 3607.72] to swindle
[3607.72 → 3608.18] them out
[3608.18 → 3608.46] of their
[3608.46 → 3609.06] money to
[3609.06 → 3609.50] line his
[3609.50 → 3609.68] own
[3609.68 → 3610.22] pockets.
[3612.22 → 3613.06] What does
[3613.06 → 3614.20] God think
[3614.20 → 3615.62] of a
[3615.62 → 3615.88] sinner
[3615.88 → 3617.02] like
[3617.02 → 3617.74] Matthew?
[3619.18 → 3619.72] Here,
[3619.90 → 3620.08] then,
[3620.16 → 3620.46] is a
[3620.46 → 3620.98] ready-made
[3620.98 → 3621.64] confrontation.
[3622.20 → 3622.80] Matthew is
[3622.80 → 3623.26] guilty of
[3623.26 → 3623.60] the same
[3623.60 → 3624.14] kinds of
[3624.14 → 3624.94] sins that
[3624.94 → 3625.38] the people
[3625.38 → 3626.02] of Jerusalem
[3626.02 → 3626.48] back in
[3626.48 → 3626.96] Jeremiah's
[3626.96 → 3627.24] day are
[3627.24 → 3627.82] guilty of,
[3628.12 → 3628.94] finding life
[3628.94 → 3629.54] in money
[3629.54 → 3630.58] and not
[3630.58 → 3631.12] in God.
[3631.12 → 3631.16] God,
[3631.86 → 3632.26] and then
[3632.26 → 3632.66] here we
[3632.66 → 3632.96] have
[3632.96 → 3633.34] Jesus,
[3633.50 → 3633.76] God,
[3633.82 → 3634.00] made
[3634.00 → 3634.48] flesh.
[3635.52 → 3635.82] Matthew
[3635.82 → 3636.12] is a
[3636.12 → 3636.34] sinful
[3636.34 → 3636.76] man
[3636.76 → 3637.08] who
[3637.08 → 3637.22] has
[3637.22 → 3637.48] turned
[3637.48 → 3637.90] away
[3637.90 → 3638.36] from
[3638.36 → 3638.74] God.
[3638.86 → 3639.08] And
[3639.08 → 3639.40] what does
[3639.40 → 3639.72] Jesus
[3639.72 → 3640.12] do?
[3641.54 → 3642.04] What's
[3642.04 → 3642.42] Jesus'
[3642.68 → 3643.20] heart
[3643.20 → 3644.02] towards
[3644.02 → 3644.78] Matthew,
[3645.00 → 3645.38] the tax
[3645.38 → 3645.70] collector?
[3646.44 → 3646.62] Well,
[3646.74 → 3647.34] will Jesus
[3647.34 → 3648.06] rebuke him?
[3648.62 → 3649.16] Will Jesus
[3649.16 → 3649.90] attack him?
[3650.52 → 3651.28] Will Jesus
[3651.28 → 3652.14] judge him?
[3653.26 → 3653.60] No.
[3654.60 → 3655.38] What does
[3655.38 → 3655.80] he says?
[3655.92 → 3656.50] He says,
[3656.74 → 3657.28] Jesus says,
[3657.28 → 3657.92] come,
[3658.08 → 3658.74] follow me.
[3661.06 → 3661.38] And then
[3661.38 → 3661.78] later,
[3661.94 → 3662.38] Jesus and
[3662.38 → 3663.14] Matthew and
[3663.14 → 3663.96] some of
[3663.96 → 3664.24] the other
[3664.24 → 3664.88] disciples are
[3664.88 → 3665.76] eating together
[3665.76 → 3666.50] and some
[3666.50 → 3667.28] Pharisees are
[3667.28 → 3667.68] there and
[3667.68 → 3668.08] they ask a
[3668.08 → 3668.52] question.
[3669.04 → 3669.24] Now,
[3669.32 → 3669.86] the Pharisees
[3669.86 → 3670.60] are folks
[3670.60 → 3671.20] who to
[3671.20 → 3671.78] their best
[3671.78 → 3672.18] of their
[3672.18 → 3672.70] ability
[3672.70 → 3673.64] are trying
[3673.64 → 3673.96] to draw
[3673.96 → 3674.36] close to
[3674.36 → 3674.60] God.
[3675.94 → 3676.38] They
[3676.38 → 3676.96] recognize
[3676.96 → 3678.40] the oddity
[3678.40 → 3679.10] of Jesus
[3679.10 → 3680.04] being friendly
[3680.04 → 3680.66] with sinners.
[3681.84 → 3682.34] And what
[3682.34 → 3682.74] does Jesus
[3682.74 → 3683.14] say?
[3684.00 → 3684.58] He says,
[3684.68 → 3685.00] listen,
[3685.68 → 3686.50] healthy people
[3686.50 → 3687.02] don't need
[3687.02 → 3687.52] a doctor.
[3688.18 → 3688.76] Only sick
[3688.76 → 3689.06] people.
[3689.18 → 3689.68] I came
[3689.68 → 3690.26] for sinners.
[3692.30 → 3692.74] So,
[3692.82 → 3693.02] friends,
[3693.08 → 3693.40] if you
[3693.40 → 3693.84] want to
[3693.84 → 3694.24] know the
[3694.24 → 3694.74] heart of
[3694.74 → 3695.18] God,
[3695.30 → 3695.62] if you
[3695.62 → 3695.90] want to
[3695.90 → 3696.18] know the
[3696.18 → 3696.58] heart of
[3696.58 → 3697.02] the God
[3697.02 → 3697.28] of the
[3697.28 → 3697.58] book of
[3697.58 → 3698.32] Lamentations,
[3698.54 → 3699.02] then we
[3699.02 → 3699.40] look to
[3699.40 → 3699.82] Jesus.
[3701.08 → 3701.28] Right?
[3701.34 → 3701.56] If you
[3701.56 → 3701.96] want to
[3701.96 → 3702.66] know the
[3702.66 → 3703.08] heart of
[3703.08 → 3703.64] God towards
[3703.64 → 3704.44] you and
[3704.44 → 3704.78] to your
[3704.78 → 3705.82] neighbours and
[3705.82 → 3706.46] to people
[3706.46 → 3707.36] in a
[3707.36 → 3708.42] sinful world
[3708.42 → 3709.52] broken by
[3709.52 → 3709.92] sin,
[3710.66 → 3711.84] then know
[3711.84 → 3712.32] that he is
[3712.32 → 3713.12] a compassionate
[3713.12 → 3714.22] doctor who
[3714.22 → 3714.80] has come
[3714.80 → 3715.64] to heal.
[3716.50 → 3720.32] that's who
[3720.32 → 3721.12] Jesus was in
[3721.12 → 3721.84] his life
[3721.84 → 3722.66] among us.
[3723.76 → 3724.14] Then,
[3724.34 → 3725.06] think about
[3725.06 → 3725.96] Jesus' own
[3725.96 → 3726.76] suffering and
[3726.76 → 3727.06] death.
[3728.10 → 3729.04] We read in
[3729.04 → 3729.66] Lamentations
[3729.66 → 3730.92] here that
[3730.92 → 3731.32] we are
[3731.32 → 3731.94] supposed to
[3731.94 → 3732.40] endure
[3732.40 → 3733.44] suffering with
[3733.44 → 3734.02] silence,
[3734.40 → 3735.28] being struck
[3735.28 → 3735.70] on the
[3735.70 → 3736.00] cheek,
[3736.54 → 3737.14] being filled
[3737.14 → 3738.74] with insults.
[3739.48 → 3740.18] And what
[3740.18 → 3740.60] happened to
[3740.60 → 3740.88] Jesus?
[3742.04 → 3742.84] After his
[3742.84 → 3743.62] arrest in
[3743.62 → 3744.48] the Garden
[3744.48 → 3745.20] of Gethsemane,
[3745.20 → 3746.06] Jesus is
[3746.06 → 3746.66] brought before
[3746.66 → 3747.12] the Jewish
[3747.12 → 3747.82] ruling council
[3747.82 → 3748.60] and he
[3748.60 → 3749.26] gave his
[3749.26 → 3749.74] cheeks to
[3749.74 → 3750.36] be struck,
[3751.00 → 3751.76] his body
[3751.76 → 3752.46] to be broken
[3752.46 → 3752.98] for his
[3752.98 → 3753.34] people,
[3753.52 → 3753.88] and he
[3753.88 → 3754.68] was mocked
[3754.68 → 3755.46] along the
[3755.46 → 3755.78] way.
[3756.92 → 3757.60] And how
[3757.60 → 3757.98] does he
[3757.98 → 3758.48] bear it?
[3758.74 → 3759.08] Does he
[3759.08 → 3759.46] bear it
[3759.46 → 3760.96] with protest
[3760.96 → 3761.94] and promises
[3761.94 → 3762.64] of retribution?
[3763.44 → 3763.70] No,
[3763.78 → 3764.34] he bears it
[3764.34 → 3765.06] with silence.
[3766.98 → 3767.10] Right?
[3767.24 → 3768.32] Isaiah 53,
[3768.96 → 3769.42] he was
[3769.42 → 3770.08] oppressed
[3770.08 → 3771.28] and afflicted,
[3771.86 → 3772.72] yet he
[3772.72 → 3773.26] did not
[3773.26 → 3773.86] open his
[3773.86 → 3774.20] mouth.
[3774.94 → 3775.50] He was
[3775.50 → 3776.16] led like
[3776.16 → 3776.82] a lamb
[3776.82 → 3777.28] to the
[3777.28 → 3777.62] slaughter.
[3778.12 → 3778.70] And as a
[3778.70 → 3779.54] sheep before
[3779.54 → 3780.44] its shearers
[3780.44 → 3781.18] is silent,
[3781.46 → 3782.22] so he
[3782.22 → 3782.82] did not
[3782.82 → 3783.70] open his
[3783.70 → 3784.00] mouth.
[3787.18 → 3788.04] Then think
[3788.04 → 3788.74] about the
[3788.74 → 3790.60] weight that
[3790.60 → 3791.42] Jesus endured
[3791.42 → 3793.54] between his
[3793.54 → 3794.12] death on the
[3794.12 → 3795.30] cross and
[3795.30 → 3796.12] his resurrection
[3796.12 → 3796.96] three days
[3796.96 → 3797.32] later.
[3798.28 → 3798.50] Right?
[3798.56 → 3799.18] Is there any
[3799.18 → 3800.12] clearer picture
[3800.12 → 3800.74] of what it
[3800.74 → 3801.48] means to
[3801.48 → 3802.62] wait on the
[3802.62 → 3803.00] Lord?
[3804.24 → 3804.60] Jesus
[3804.60 → 3805.28] waited in
[3805.28 → 3805.98] the grave,
[3806.70 → 3806.86] right?
[3806.94 → 3807.32] And he
[3807.32 → 3807.98] did not
[3807.98 → 3808.38] wait in
[3808.38 → 3809.20] vain because
[3809.20 → 3809.74] on the
[3809.74 → 3810.24] other side
[3810.24 → 3810.72] of waiting
[3810.72 → 3811.96] is resurrection.
[3812.88 → 3813.54] There's no
[3813.54 → 3814.40] better fulfillment
[3814.40 → 3815.36] of this
[3815.36 → 3815.70] phrase in
[3815.70 → 3816.32] lamentations
[3816.32 → 3816.94] that the
[3816.94 → 3817.48] Lord is
[3817.48 → 3818.40] good to
[3818.40 → 3818.82] those who
[3818.82 → 3819.22] wait on
[3819.22 → 3819.46] him.
[3820.92 → 3821.16] And so
[3821.16 → 3821.46] you see,
[3821.58 → 3821.82] friends,
[3822.24 → 3823.56] Jesus embodies
[3823.56 → 3824.88] the heart
[3824.88 → 3825.30] of lament.
[3825.74 → 3826.46] He lived
[3826.46 → 3827.02] it out in
[3827.02 → 3827.60] his life,
[3828.16 → 3828.44] in his
[3828.44 → 3828.78] suffering,
[3828.90 → 3829.12] in his
[3829.12 → 3829.40] death,
[3829.54 → 3829.96] in his
[3829.96 → 3830.44] resurrection.
[3830.44 → 3832.42] And he
[3832.42 → 3832.82] lived it
[3832.82 → 3833.14] out for
[3833.14 → 3833.40] us.
[3833.50 → 3834.48] He drew
[3834.48 → 3835.06] close to
[3835.06 → 3835.36] God.
[3836.70 → 3837.36] And he
[3837.36 → 3838.14] did so
[3838.14 → 3839.22] to give
[3839.22 → 3839.96] us the
[3839.96 → 3840.86] promise of
[3840.86 → 3841.18] hope.
[3841.90 → 3842.38] That even
[3842.38 → 3842.90] in the midst
[3842.90 → 3843.20] of our
[3843.20 → 3843.52] suffering,
[3843.60 → 3843.90] that God
[3843.90 → 3844.44] is sovereign,
[3845.40 → 3845.86] that he
[3845.86 → 3846.50] loves us
[3846.50 → 3847.18] with unfailing
[3847.18 → 3847.66] love,
[3848.46 → 3849.02] and because
[3849.02 → 3849.46] of what
[3849.46 → 3849.96] Christ has
[3849.96 → 3850.32] done,
[3850.98 → 3851.56] we can
[3851.56 → 3851.92] know that
[3851.92 → 3852.36] he will
[3852.36 → 3852.90] not
[3852.90 → 3854.76] cast us
[3854.76 → 3855.22] off
[3855.22 → 3855.92] forever.
[3855.92 → 3857.84] He has
[3857.84 → 3858.46] compassion
[3858.46 → 3859.06] on all
[3859.06 → 3860.40] those who
[3860.40 → 3860.88] draw close
[3860.88 → 3861.12] to him
[3861.12 → 3861.56] in faith.
[3862.50 → 3863.10] So let's
[3863.10 → 3863.34] pray.
[3866.76 → 3867.36] Lord,
[3867.48 → 3868.82] we ask
[3868.82 → 3871.90] in this
[3871.90 → 3873.08] season of
[3873.08 → 3874.66] Lent that
[3874.66 → 3874.94] you would
[3874.94 → 3875.70] teach us
[3875.70 → 3876.76] what it
[3876.76 → 3877.16] means to
[3877.16 → 3877.50] lament.
[3878.02 → 3878.22] Lord,
[3878.28 → 3878.62] teach us
[3878.62 → 3879.08] how to
[3879.08 → 3879.32] lament.
[3880.58 → 3881.00] Teach us
[3881.00 → 3881.48] how to be
[3881.48 → 3881.96] able to
[3881.96 → 3882.84] speak honest
[3882.84 → 3883.76] words about
[3883.76 → 3884.18] what is
[3884.18 → 3884.60] wrong.
[3884.60 → 3886.36] but not
[3886.36 → 3886.82] with hearts
[3886.82 → 3887.38] of bitterness,
[3888.34 → 3889.82] but rather
[3889.82 → 3890.32] with hearts
[3890.32 → 3890.88] of hope.
[3891.60 → 3892.30] Because we
[3892.30 → 3892.98] have come,
[3893.10 → 3893.48] because you
[3893.48 → 3894.02] have come,
[3894.36 → 3894.90] and you
[3894.90 → 3895.66] have taken
[3895.66 → 3896.72] all of
[3896.72 → 3897.56] this pain
[3897.56 → 3898.42] up in
[3898.42 → 3898.94] yourself,
[3899.44 → 3900.24] and you've
[3900.24 → 3900.58] given us
[3900.58 → 3901.08] the promise
[3901.08 → 3901.42] that your
[3901.42 → 3902.08] never love
[3902.08 → 3902.52] fails.
[3903.20 → 3903.76] So please
[3903.76 → 3904.50] help us,
[3904.66 → 3904.78] Lord,
[3905.26 → 3905.98] to draw near
[3905.98 → 3906.54] to you in
[3906.54 → 3906.90] whatever
[3906.90 → 3908.02] suffering that
[3908.02 → 3908.80] we face
[3908.80 → 3909.58] this day.
[3910.24 → 3910.72] We pray
[3910.72 → 3911.06] in Jesus'
[3911.06 → 3911.42] name.
[3912.04 → 3912.32] Amen.
[3915.42 → 3916.04] All right.
[3916.18 → 3916.44] So let's
[3916.44 → 3916.98] prepare to
[3916.98 → 3917.84] stand and
[3917.84 → 3918.92] sing a
[3918.92 → 3919.20] song of
[3919.20 → 3919.50] response.
[3919.50 → 3945.78] I cry out
[3945.78 → 3950.58] For your hand of mercy to heal me
[3950.58 → 3953.64] I am weak
[3953.64 → 3958.50] I need your love to free me
[3958.50 → 3961.40] O Lord, my rock
[3961.40 → 3966.08] My strength and weakness
[3966.08 → 3970.06] The mercy weep
[3970.06 → 3975.26] O Lord, you are my hope
[3975.26 → 3980.62] Your promise never fails me
[3980.62 → 3987.84] And my desire is to follow you forever
[3987.84 → 3990.48] For you are good
[3990.48 → 3992.46] For you are good
[3992.46 → 3996.34] For you are good to me
[3996.34 → 3998.42] For you are good
[3998.42 → 4000.34] For you are good
[4000.34 → 4004.70] For you are good to me
[4004.70 → 4007.92] I cry out
[4007.92 → 4013.28] For your hand of mercy to heal me
[4013.28 → 4016.08] I am weak
[4016.08 → 4020.50] And I need your love to free me
[4020.50 → 4023.84] O Lord, my rock
[4023.84 → 4028.28] My strength and weakness
[4028.28 → 4030.22] To publish you
[4030.22 → 4033.48] And I bring my love to free me
[4033.48 → 4033.94] I am weak
[4033.94 → 4042.66] I love to add a
[4042.66 → 4043.44] us me
[4043.44 → 4050.04] And my desire is to follow you forever.
[4050.98 → 4058.42] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[4058.42 → 4066.60] For you are good, for you are good, for you are good to me.
[4073.44 → 4087.88] The strength as love of the Lord never sees this.
[4087.88 → 4093.88] His mercies never come to an end.
[4094.50 → 4099.88] They are new every morning, new every morning.
[4099.88 → 4105.54] Great is your faithfulness, O Lord.
[4106.08 → 4110.18] Great is your faithfulness.
[4110.78 → 4116.88] The strength as love of the Lord never sees this.
[4117.70 → 4123.06] His mercies never come to an end.
[4123.06 → 4128.90] They are new every morning, new every morning.
[4128.90 → 4134.56] Great is your faithfulness, O Lord.
[4135.10 → 4139.94] Great is your faithfulness.
[4142.10 → 4143.08] Let us sing.
[4143.08 → 4155.04] So we now come to respond to God's mercy by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[4155.98 → 4158.96] And being reminded that everything belongs to God.
[4159.68 → 4166.32] And so we worship him by giving back to him a part of what he's given us in response to his wonder.
[4166.32 → 4171.38] Our designated offering today is for M2W2.
[4171.72 → 4176.34] This is a prison ministry that seeks to bring hope to prisoners.
[4176.88 → 4179.68] And I had a question from the congregation.
[4180.48 → 4182.22] What does M2W2 stand for?
[4182.30 → 4182.86] Does anybody know?
[4182.86 → 4187.96] Men to men, women to women.
[4189.30 → 4189.86] Thank you.
[4190.02 → 4190.22] Okay.
[4190.86 → 4192.68] So that's our designated offering for today.
[4192.92 → 4196.52] May I ask our deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[4196.52 → 4198.26] Do you have any questions?
[4198.26 → 4201.98] If I want to meet you in a conversation, college chanting, Class,lardon?
[4209.82 → 4210.52] Amen.
[4214.72 → 4215.12] Amen.
[4215.12 → 4216.68] Even if we hammerer.
[4216.68 → 4218.56] Just through to us.
[4218.56 → 4219.12] Let's see.
[4219.12 → 4220.04] I am soul though.
[4220.04 → 4220.48] Psych rinse with things in place to us.
[4220.48 → 4221.06] Amen.
[4221.06 → 4221.34] yup!
[4221.34 → 4221.58] And what do you think?
[4221.58 → 4221.68] Do you there under your task?
[4221.68 → 4222.16] Do you like to lose anything?
[4222.16 → 4223.56] Do you have a victory independently?
[4223.56 → 4225.56] Amen.
[4253.56 → 4255.56] Amen.
[4283.56 → 4285.56] Amen.
[4313.56 → 4315.56] Amen.

[4321.56 → 4323.56] Amen.
[4323.56 → 4325.56] Amen.
[4333.56 → 4335.56] So we'll go to the Lord in prayer.
[4335.56 → 4342.56] Before we do so, just for those of you who aren't already aware, there are two bereavement notices in your bulletin.
[4342.56 → 4350.56] The first one was Jerry Iron, who went to be with the Lord Saturday morning, March 15th, father of Wayne.
[4350.56 → 4357.56] And also Mike Bart, who passed away on March 14th.
[4357.56 → 4367.56] And so we'll pray for Kathy, Mike's children as well, and also Wayne and Jeanette and other family members of Jerry.
[4367.56 → 4370.56] And so let's go to the Lord in prayer now.
[4370.56 → 4374.56] At the close of our time, we will say the Lord's prayer together.
[4374.56 → 4376.56] Those words will be on the screen.
[4376.56 → 4378.56] Okay, let's pray.
