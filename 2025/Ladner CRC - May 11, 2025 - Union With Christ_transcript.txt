[520.16 --> 528.32]  renewed like the eagles. Praise the Lord, O my soul. Please join me as we come before this God
[528.32 --> 536.30]  in a prayer of praise and adoration. Join me in prayer. Our Father in heaven, we thank you for
[536.30 --> 544.74]  this day that you have made. It is a day that is even more beautiful and more enhanced because
[544.74 --> 551.40]  it is a day that you have drawn your people to worship you. And Father, you call us this morning
[551.40 --> 559.96]  to see and to understand more clearly who you are and what you do for us. And in response, we want to
[559.96 --> 566.88]  praise you from our inmost being to bless your name, to recognize all that you have done, are doing,
[567.00 --> 573.90]  and promised to do through our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, you are God who forgives and who heals
[573.90 --> 581.00]  and renews and redeems and makes us beautiful in your sight through the work of Christ in us.
[582.54 --> 593.06]  Lord, we often find ourselves weary, battered, and harassed by the world. But we thank you that when
[593.06 --> 601.48]  we come to you in faith, you give us a firm hope. You show us that all we need to have is our need
[601.48 --> 609.24]  for you and to see you as the only one who can meet us in our need. So we come to you this morning.
[610.38 --> 616.50]  Praise be to you, our triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And may our worship this morning be to
[616.50 --> 624.74]  your praise and glory and honor. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's please stand and hear God's greeting
[624.74 --> 636.02]  to us this morning from Psalm 36, verse 7. How precious is your steadfast love, O God. The children
[636.02 --> 643.64]  of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings. As God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one
[643.64 --> 650.64]  another.

[1078.04 --> 1084.40]  and to obey everything that he has commanded until the end of the age.
[1085.44 --> 1093.04]  But in our time of confession today, let's confess the many ways that we do not obey our Lord Jesus.
[1093.04 --> 1100.02]  The way we are not obedient to his word and all that he has revealed about himself and about the world to us.
[1100.64 --> 1107.02]  And so as we confess, let us trade in our emptiness for his fullness.
[1108.04 --> 1110.58]  Would you please join me as I lead us in a prayer of confession?
[1112.74 --> 1119.86]  Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed,
[1120.06 --> 1124.08]  by what we have done and by what we have left undone.
[1124.60 --> 1127.32]  We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1128.02 --> 1131.04]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1131.74 --> 1134.90]  We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
[1134.90 --> 1140.28]  For the sake of your son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us,
[1140.72 --> 1147.14]  that we may delight in your will and walk in your ways, to the glory of your name.
[1147.92 --> 1148.34]  Amen.
[1148.34 --> 1159.90]  So in response to our prayers for mercy, our God is not silent, but responds with amazing grace.
[1160.68 --> 1167.06]  So children of God, please hear these words of assurance to us from Titus chapter 3 verses 4 to 7.
[1167.06 --> 1174.52]  But when the kindness and love of God, our Savior appeared, he saved us,
[1174.84 --> 1180.16]  not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.
[1180.88 --> 1186.36]  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
[1186.88 --> 1193.08]  whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ, our Savior,
[1193.08 --> 1198.54]  so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs,
[1199.18 --> 1201.96]  having the hope of eternal life.
[1202.76 --> 1203.90]  Thanks be to God.
[1204.04 --> 1206.74]  Let's all stand and let's sing a song of response together.
[1206.74 --> 1236.72]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[1236.74 --> 1266.72]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[1266.74 --> 1268.74]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[1268.74 --> 1296.72]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[1296.72 --> 1326.70]  Let's sing a song of response together.
[1326.70 --> 1337.70]  Oh, dear, set up a path for you, Lord, to be.
[1337.70 --> 1350.70]  Oh, dear, set up a path for you, Lord, to be.
[1350.70 --> 1362.70]  These times have come, now comes from these times.
[1362.70 --> 1373.70]  It's for me, oh, dear, set up a path for you, Lord.
[1373.70 --> 1383.70]  I choose to be, oh, dear, set up a path for you, Lord, to be.
[1383.70 --> 1388.70]  Ready to do your way.
[1388.70 --> 1395.70]  Ready to do your way.
[1395.70 --> 1402.70]  May we sing.
[1402.70 --> 1411.70]  We come now to the table of the Lord.
[1411.70 --> 1416.70]  We come to celebrate his Holy Supper, Holy Communion.
[1416.70 --> 1424.70]  And this, the table of the Lord, is a meal that our Lord Jesus has prepared for us, his people.
[1424.70 --> 1429.70]  And it's a meal that is a foretaste of another feast.
[1429.70 --> 1433.70]  And that feast is a wedding feast.
[1433.70 --> 1439.70]  I don't know, when you go to a wedding feast, right, they bring out often the most delicious meals.
[1439.70 --> 1445.70]  The delicious dishes that you share together with others as you celebrate a wedding.
[1445.70 --> 1452.70]  And in the same way, as we come to this table, we come to the marriage supper of the Lamb, in many ways.
[1452.70 --> 1462.70]  Where Christ, our groom, has paid the price to win us and to sanctify us as his bride, us the church.
[1462.70 --> 1470.70]  And so, as you come to this table this morning, know that you come as the bride of Christ.
[1470.70 --> 1478.70]  Bought by his blood, secure in his blood, and united to him through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1478.70 --> 1481.70]  And we begin by confessing our faith together.
[1481.70 --> 1485.70]  It's a faith that unites us with God and with one another.
[1485.70 --> 1489.70]  So, in the words of the Apostles' Creed, let's confess our faith.
[1489.70 --> 1496.70]  I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.
[1496.70 --> 1506.70]  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[1506.70 --> 1513.70]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[1513.70 --> 1515.70]  He descended to hell.
[1515.70 --> 1519.70]  The third day, he rose again from the dead.
[1519.70 --> 1526.70]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[1526.70 --> 1531.70]  From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1531.70 --> 1545.70]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[1545.70 --> 1546.70]  Amen.
[1546.70 --> 1556.70]  Well, friends, if this is your confession, and if you have been baptized into the church, into a Christian church, this meal is for you.
[1556.70 --> 1557.70]  You are the bride of Christ.
[1557.70 --> 1566.70]  If you are here this morning, and you have not yet put your faith in Jesus, you are our most welcome guest.
[1566.70 --> 1568.70]  And I am so glad that you are here.
[1568.70 --> 1578.70]  But we ask you at this time not to take this meal, because this is a meal that is reserved for those who have been united to Jesus by faith.
[1578.70 --> 1583.70]  And so as the elements are passed to you, please don't take them, just pass them along.
[1583.70 --> 1587.70]  But instead, we invite you to receive Jesus Christ.
[1587.70 --> 1597.70]  To receive him as your Savior, who died on the cross, shed his blood to redeem you, and to offer you life abundant.
[1597.70 --> 1607.70]  So, hear these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper.
[1607.70 --> 1614.70]  The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said,
[1614.70 --> 1619.70]  This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.
[1619.70 --> 1627.70]  In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1627.70 --> 1631.70]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[1631.70 --> 1640.70]  For whenever, as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1640.70 --> 1646.70]  So let's lift up our hearts together in the words of the liturgy here.
[1646.70 --> 1649.70]  Brothers and sisters, lift up your hearts.
[1649.70 --> 1651.70]  We lift them up to the Lord.
[1651.70 --> 1653.70]  We are his people.
[1653.70 --> 1655.70]  We are redeemed by his grace.
[1655.70 --> 1658.70]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1658.70 --> 1660.70]  Christ has died.
[1660.70 --> 1661.70]  Christ is risen.
[1661.70 --> 1663.70]  Christ will come again.
[1663.70 --> 1667.70]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1667.70 --> 1668.70]  Hallelujah.
[1669.70 --> 1673.70]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you as people.
[1673.70 --> 1678.70]  He invites you to come and to feed on him by faith with thanksgiving in your heart,
[1678.70 --> 1683.70]  and trusting that he died for your forgiveness.
[1683.70 --> 1688.70]  So may I ask our elders or deacons who are serving to come forward.
[1688.70 --> 1689.70]  Help me distribute the elements.
[1689.70 --> 1693.70]  And as that is happening, this is a time for you to dwell with the Lord,
[1693.70 --> 1700.70]  to commune with him through prayer, through meditation, and thanksgiving.
[1700.70 --> 1702.70]  One prayer is right?
[1702.70 --> 1703.70]  Thank you.
[1703.70 --> 1704.70]  Dear God.
[1704.70 --> 1705.70]  He loved Him.
[1705.70 --> 1706.70]  Quite a new prayer.
[1706.70 --> 1708.70]  He enjoyed it.
[1708.70 --> 1711.48]  For Nä+, the plague, the loss of God of the doubt,
[1711.48 --> 1713.62]  the vacuum of the blood of God of the life.
[1713.62 --> 1714.62]  We need it.
[1714.62 --> 1716.12]  Thank you.
[1716.12 --> 1717.72]  A Freddie, the Lord of the AbbeyEL,
[1719.20 --> 1719.76]  in your heart.
[1719.76 --> 1721.76]  Amen.
[1749.76 --> 1751.76]  Amen.
[1779.76 --> 1781.76]  Amen.
[1809.76 --> 1811.76]  Amen.
[1839.76 --> 1841.76]  Amen.
[1869.76 --> 1871.76]  Amen.
[1899.76 --> 1901.76]  Amen.
[1913.76 --> 1916.28]  Sisters, the body of Christ broken for you.
[1916.48 --> 1917.06]  Let's eat together.
[1929.76 --> 1931.76]  Amen.
[1959.76 --> 1961.76]  Amen.
[1989.76 --> 1991.76]  Amen.
[2019.76 --> 2021.76]  Amen.

[2141.76 --> 2143.76]  Amen.
[2143.76 --> 2145.76]  Amen.
[2145.76 --> 2147.76]  Amen.
[2147.76 --> 2149.76]  Amen.
[2149.76 --> 2151.76]  Amen.
[2151.76 --> 2153.76]  Amen.
[2153.76 --> 2155.76]  Amen.
[2155.76 --> 2157.76]  Amen.
[2157.76 --> 2159.76]  Amen.
[2159.76 --> 2162.76]  The blood of Christ shed for the remission of all of our sins.
[2162.76 --> 2163.76]  Let's drink together.
[2163.76 --> 2165.76]  Amen.
[2169.76 --> 2176.76]  Please join me in prayer.
[2176.76 --> 2186.76]  Oh, Lord, we praise you, for your broken body on the cross, your shed blood,
[2186.76 --> 2191.96]  the sacrifice that you paid, that you might make us to be your people,
[2191.96 --> 2198.76]  to make us your children, to sanctify us, to set us apart as holy as your saints.
[2198.76 --> 2202.84]  And Father, we receive this as a gift of your grace.
[2202.92 --> 2206.12]  It's not anything that we deserved or have done.
[2206.94 --> 2208.86]  But Lord, we receive it with thanksgiving.
[2209.60 --> 2213.24]  And we ask, Lord, as we receive it, it would change us.
[2213.50 --> 2217.48]  Would it change us so that we would be different, that we would live differently,
[2217.48 --> 2222.04]  that we would obey you in every way and to be your witnesses in the world.
[2222.94 --> 2226.94]  Lord, strengthen us through your grace as we participate in this meal
[2226.94 --> 2230.74]  and as we go on to hear your word and continue in worship.
[2230.98 --> 2232.52]  We pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[2234.60 --> 2238.02]  And may I invite the children to come up and join me right up here.
[2256.94 --> 2263.74]  We both have a hat on.
[2264.44 --> 2264.62]  Wow.
[2267.94 --> 2269.66]  Oh, nice.
[2271.32 --> 2272.54]  Okay, how are you all today?
[2273.36 --> 2273.76]  Good.
[2273.88 --> 2274.28]  Good.
[2274.28 --> 2274.34]  Good.
[2275.00 --> 2277.00]  Oh, man, your arm is broken.
[2277.14 --> 2277.48]  I'm sorry.
[2277.84 --> 2278.40]  Is it feeling better?
[2278.78 --> 2279.06]  Yeah.
[2279.20 --> 2279.66]  Yeah, good.
[2280.56 --> 2280.96]  Hello.
[2281.08 --> 2281.48]  How are you?
[2281.78 --> 2284.90]  So you guys see with this cool hat I'm wearing?
[2285.40 --> 2285.88]  Cowboy.
[2285.88 --> 2287.42]  It's a cowboy hat.
[2287.48 --> 2289.94]  Well, I was going to say it's an explorer hat.
[2290.22 --> 2292.12]  That's what I call it, explorer hat.
[2292.36 --> 2296.88]  Do you guys like to, do you all like to explore, go to new places, see new things?
[2297.44 --> 2297.88]  Yeah.
[2298.24 --> 2299.18]  Well, you know what?
[2301.40 --> 2308.20]  There are some explorers who search for something, and it's called the fountain of youth.
[2308.68 --> 2309.78]  The fountain of youth.
[2309.86 --> 2311.48]  Have you heard of the fountain of youth?
[2311.48 --> 2320.08]  Well, even back in ancient times, they thought that this existed, that it was water, that
[2320.08 --> 2322.58]  what happens if you drink the water of the fountain of youth?
[2322.58 --> 2326.16]  You live a long time.
[2326.54 --> 2328.38]  If you drink it or if you bathe in it.
[2328.82 --> 2333.42]  So lots of people throughout history have talked about this mythical fountain of youth.
[2339.88 --> 2342.08]  Today is Mother's Day.
[2343.08 --> 2343.86]  There's a connection.
[2344.20 --> 2344.70]  Let me share.
[2344.70 --> 2344.74]  Here.
[2345.74 --> 2347.48]  I'm going to read a verse from Ephesians.
[2347.80 --> 2349.00]  Do you guys know this is Mother's Day?
[2349.58 --> 2351.60]  Did you say happy Mother's Day to your moms?
[2352.48 --> 2352.88]  Yeah.
[2353.10 --> 2354.28]  And we gave her presents.
[2354.68 --> 2354.94]  Wow.
[2356.04 --> 2356.62]  Good deal.
[2356.76 --> 2357.20]  Okay, listen.
[2357.80 --> 2358.16]  Children.
[2358.52 --> 2360.18]  So I was talking to you, right?
[2361.02 --> 2366.60]  Children, obey your parents and the Lord for, this is right, honor who?
[2367.24 --> 2370.38]  Your father and mother.
[2371.00 --> 2371.14]  Right?
[2371.20 --> 2374.30]  Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.
[2374.62 --> 2375.40]  What is the promise?
[2375.52 --> 2381.14]  That if you honor your mom, it says, there's a promise, that it may go well with you, that
[2381.14 --> 2384.22]  you may enjoy long life on the earth.
[2384.50 --> 2385.24]  Did you hear that?
[2385.24 --> 2387.56]  There's a promise.
[2387.76 --> 2391.04]  If you honor your father and mother, you will enjoy long life.
[2391.50 --> 2392.44]  It's like the fountain of youth.
[2393.28 --> 2395.52]  So you don't have to look for a fountain of youth.
[2395.60 --> 2402.04]  It doesn't exist because God promises that we will enjoy long life when we obey our mom
[2402.04 --> 2402.44]  and dad.
[2402.82 --> 2406.10]  Now, does that mean that you will definitely live to 100?
[2407.62 --> 2408.02]  No.
[2408.28 --> 2408.68]  No.
[2409.14 --> 2410.04]  It's not that promise.
[2410.14 --> 2410.88]  But what does it mean?
[2410.88 --> 2418.06]  It means that our moms, our dads, we're talking about moms today, that they, God gave them
[2418.06 --> 2425.50]  a job to care for us, to love us, to look out for us and tell us how to live and give
[2425.50 --> 2431.34]  us wisdom so that when we obey them and do what they say, it will go well for us.
[2431.34 --> 2437.28]  God will bless us and we will live a long life because we are obeying their wisdom.
[2438.52 --> 2446.60]  So I want to remind you today that God asks us to obey and honor our mommas and dads.
[2446.86 --> 2448.24]  So what are some ways that we can do that?
[2450.74 --> 2451.86]  Give her something.
[2451.86 --> 2453.02]  Give her something.
[2453.34 --> 2453.98]  Yeah, it's a present.
[2454.10 --> 2455.46]  You can show your love and appreciation.
[2455.70 --> 2456.84]  But how can you also obey?
[2459.36 --> 2461.82]  So if they say to do something, yeah, go ahead.
[2462.36 --> 2462.74]  Listen.
[2463.00 --> 2464.02]  Listen to what they say, yeah.
[2464.46 --> 2464.84]  Do it.
[2465.12 --> 2465.86]  And do it.
[2466.36 --> 2471.18]  And that will make your mom feel very good on Mother's Day if you do what they say.
[2471.40 --> 2471.56]  Right?
[2473.04 --> 2473.40]  Okay.
[2473.56 --> 2474.32]  So can you remember that?
[2474.50 --> 2474.84]  Yes.
[2475.00 --> 2475.30]  Okay.
[2475.56 --> 2475.74]  Good.
[2476.02 --> 2476.78]  Let me pray for us.
[2476.78 --> 2483.10]  Father, be with all of us and our children especially as we seek to honor our moms today.
[2484.00 --> 2489.46]  And Lord, help us to listen to what they say because, Lord, you have given them wisdom.
[2490.22 --> 2494.06]  And Lord, would you bless us as we do so that we may live long in the land.
[2494.54 --> 2495.68]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2495.82 --> 2495.98]  Amen.
[2497.06 --> 2497.60]  All right.
[2497.74 --> 2498.72]  Go to your classes.
[2498.72 --> 2498.90]  Go to your classes.
[2506.78 --> 2517.62]  Everyone is dismissed, our Chinese brothers and sisters, to go to their sermons and our class as well.
[2536.78 --> 2546.78]  Okay.
[2546.94 --> 2548.18]  Well, good morning, everyone, again.
[2548.94 --> 2552.24]  Invite you to take out your Bibles that you'll find in the pews in front of you.
[2552.34 --> 2556.08]  And we are looking today at Romans chapter 6.
[2556.08 --> 2565.44]  Romans chapter 6.
[2565.52 --> 2568.92]  It's on page 840 in your pew Bible, 840.
[2570.78 --> 2577.12]  And we will be today looking at the first five verses of chapter 6.
[2577.20 --> 2578.98]  And it's a wonderful passage.
[2578.98 --> 2589.00]  And my prayer this morning is that as we look at this passage together, that God would lift us up into a new understanding of ourselves.
[2589.90 --> 2593.00]  That today we would have a new understanding of ourselves.
[2593.54 --> 2596.08]  And that this new understanding would change us.
[2596.72 --> 2596.86]  Okay.
[2596.88 --> 2599.20]  It would change the way we think about ourselves and how we live.
[2599.88 --> 2607.22]  So let's read together Romans chapter 6, verses 1 through 5.
[2607.22 --> 2609.04]  It's a part of a longer section.
[2609.22 --> 2613.66]  That would be, well, all of chapter 6, but maybe 1 through 14.
[2613.90 --> 2617.50]  But we're just going to look first today at verses 1 through 5.
[2617.66 --> 2619.72]  And then we'll continue to verse 14 next week.
[2621.38 --> 2622.78]  What shall we say then?
[2623.90 --> 2627.10]  Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
[2627.94 --> 2628.90]  By no means.
[2629.60 --> 2630.94]  We died to sin.
[2631.58 --> 2633.28]  How can we live in it any longer?
[2633.28 --> 2640.38]  Or don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[2641.08 --> 2644.96]  We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death.
[2645.36 --> 2649.72]  In order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,
[2650.30 --> 2653.20]  we too may live a new life.
[2653.20 --> 2659.42]  If we have been united with him, with him like this in his death,
[2659.96 --> 2664.84]  we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.
[2665.60 --> 2666.72]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2669.18 --> 2672.68]  So let us pray and ask for God's blessing upon his word.
[2673.64 --> 2676.30]  Father in heaven, thank you for the gift of your word
[2676.30 --> 2678.88]  in which we see the beauty of the gospel.
[2679.62 --> 2682.30]  It's the only place, Lord, that we can know it and see it.
[2682.30 --> 2686.82]  And we pray that by your Holy Spirit, you would help us to understand your word,
[2687.18 --> 2690.90]  to be blessed by it, to be challenged and encouraged,
[2691.70 --> 2692.74]  and Lord, to be taught.
[2693.66 --> 2696.08]  And to do so with open hearts and open minds,
[2696.34 --> 2698.02]  not forgetting what we have learned,
[2698.10 --> 2701.14]  but treasuring it in our hearts and being changed by it.
[2701.62 --> 2703.12]  We ask in Jesus' name.
[2703.78 --> 2704.06]  Amen.
[2704.06 --> 2709.38]  So here in Romans 6, Paul is addressing a question.
[2710.02 --> 2718.02]  Really, it's an objection to the gospel that he has been writing and teaching about all up until now.
[2718.38 --> 2719.92]  And the question goes like this.
[2719.92 --> 2724.20]  Paul, if what you are saying is true,
[2724.84 --> 2727.60]  that salvation is a gift and not our own achievement,
[2728.44 --> 2733.06]  right, if it is true that salvation is entirely free, entirely by grace,
[2733.38 --> 2736.80]  there's no way that we could ever through our works
[2736.80 --> 2740.70]  hope to earn God's favor and forgiveness.
[2740.70 --> 2744.78]  If that's all true, what does it matter how we live?
[2748.30 --> 2751.64]  If grace is free, if the gospel is free,
[2752.34 --> 2753.86]  it doesn't depend on us at all.
[2753.94 --> 2756.76]  Why does it matter how we live?
[2757.48 --> 2760.38]  Why might we, you know, why don't we just continue in sin?
[2760.38 --> 2763.82]  Now, when I was a younger child,
[2764.36 --> 2766.00]  in elementary school,
[2766.12 --> 2768.70]  there was a common playground taunt.
[2769.60 --> 2770.84]  And it went something like this.
[2771.28 --> 2773.96]  When someone would say they loved something,
[2774.48 --> 2776.80]  some other clever child would retort,
[2777.26 --> 2778.36]  well, then why don't you marry it?
[2779.54 --> 2781.32]  Now, have you, anybody heard this?
[2781.46 --> 2782.90]  People my age, kind of?
[2783.28 --> 2783.90]  Yeah, okay.
[2784.64 --> 2786.06]  I don't think they say this anymore,
[2786.66 --> 2787.68]  which is fine.
[2788.30 --> 2789.80]  So, like, it's a hot summer day,
[2789.80 --> 2790.48]  and someone would say,
[2790.58 --> 2791.62]  oh, I love ice cream.
[2792.46 --> 2793.14]  Someone would say,
[2793.30 --> 2794.48]  well, then why don't you marry ice cream?
[2795.54 --> 2797.50]  And so this is how the playground taunt went.
[2797.94 --> 2800.02]  And this why don't you marry it,
[2800.12 --> 2801.96]  come back, or burn, as they say,
[2802.58 --> 2804.46]  is an example of taking something
[2804.46 --> 2806.22]  to its logical extreme.
[2807.30 --> 2807.48]  Right?
[2807.56 --> 2809.32]  Simply because you love ice cream
[2809.32 --> 2810.70]  does not mean you want to enter
[2810.70 --> 2812.86]  into a relationship of holy matrimony with it.
[2814.50 --> 2815.60]  And I bring this up
[2815.60 --> 2817.38]  because the objection to the gospel
[2817.38 --> 2818.62]  that Paul is addressing here
[2818.62 --> 2820.02]  in chapter 6, verse 1,
[2820.10 --> 2821.94]  is the functional equivalent
[2821.94 --> 2824.10]  of the playground taunt,
[2824.44 --> 2825.66]  of taking something
[2825.66 --> 2827.06]  to its logical extreme
[2827.06 --> 2828.34]  or beyond.
[2829.00 --> 2830.70]  So let's have a look at verse 1.
[2832.28 --> 2833.62]  What shall we say then?
[2834.32 --> 2836.10]  Shall we go on sinning
[2836.10 --> 2837.86]  so that grace may increase?
[2839.12 --> 2839.74]  It's like saying,
[2839.84 --> 2840.30]  well, Paul,
[2840.40 --> 2842.56]  if you love grace so much,
[2843.14 --> 2844.72]  why don't you just keep on sinning
[2844.72 --> 2846.10]  so that you can get even more
[2846.10 --> 2848.06]  of God's grace and forgiveness?
[2849.32 --> 2849.56]  Right?
[2849.62 --> 2851.60]  If you're a person who loves grace,
[2852.22 --> 2853.30]  why not find a way
[2853.30 --> 2854.86]  to get a million times
[2854.86 --> 2856.20]  the amount of grace?
[2858.68 --> 2860.04]  And that's what some people conclude.
[2860.04 --> 2861.16]  Right?
[2861.20 --> 2862.80]  When they hear the gospel
[2862.80 --> 2863.76]  that we are justified,
[2864.04 --> 2864.84]  made right with God,
[2865.02 --> 2866.92]  freely by his grace.
[2867.86 --> 2869.32]  And it really actually gets
[2869.32 --> 2871.66]  to a question that all of us ask.
[2872.34 --> 2873.08]  Which is,
[2873.52 --> 2875.72]  how are we as Christians
[2875.72 --> 2877.28]  to deal with sin?
[2878.44 --> 2879.36]  What should be our relationship
[2879.92 --> 2880.88]  to sin?
[2880.94 --> 2882.90]  How should we relate to sin?
[2883.70 --> 2884.76]  And we may wonder,
[2884.90 --> 2885.80]  based on all that Paul
[2885.80 --> 2887.12]  has been saying,
[2887.70 --> 2889.06]  that maybe we don't really
[2889.06 --> 2890.52]  have to worry about it anymore.
[2891.58 --> 2892.50]  That maybe, you know,
[2892.60 --> 2893.96]  we can just kind of forget
[2893.96 --> 2894.88]  this whole sin thing
[2894.88 --> 2896.08]  and just live the way we want.
[2896.92 --> 2898.44]  One person put it like this.
[2898.48 --> 2898.90]  He said,
[2899.26 --> 2900.36]  I like to sin.
[2901.28 --> 2903.24]  God apparently likes to forgive.
[2904.32 --> 2905.94]  It's a fantastic arrangement.
[2908.50 --> 2909.94]  Now, in verse 2,
[2910.18 --> 2911.56]  what is Paul's answer to that?
[2912.90 --> 2915.32]  By no means.
[2915.60 --> 2916.28]  It's emphatic.
[2916.96 --> 2917.92]  By no means.
[2919.44 --> 2921.30]  But notice that he doesn't just say,
[2921.56 --> 2922.78]  no, that's a crazy idea.
[2922.96 --> 2924.10]  Now let's just get on with it.
[2924.76 --> 2926.26]  He actually goes into
[2926.26 --> 2927.82]  an extended explanation
[2927.82 --> 2929.10]  that takes us through
[2929.10 --> 2930.22]  a lot of chapter 6.
[2931.34 --> 2932.76]  And he gives an explanation
[2932.76 --> 2935.30]  as to why this is the case.
[2935.50 --> 2936.08]  Why not?
[2936.78 --> 2938.50]  And this is important pastorally
[2938.50 --> 2939.62]  because not only,
[2939.88 --> 2940.10]  you know,
[2940.18 --> 2941.02]  we don't just say,
[2941.02 --> 2942.42]  I can't believe you asked
[2942.42 --> 2942.98]  that question.
[2943.24 --> 2944.50]  I can't believe you think that.
[2944.56 --> 2945.58]  But no, we explain.
[2946.40 --> 2946.60]  Right?
[2946.68 --> 2948.68]  We explain why we believe
[2948.68 --> 2949.28]  what we do.
[2950.70 --> 2951.76]  And so Paul goes on
[2951.76 --> 2952.54]  to explain
[2952.54 --> 2954.22]  how the gospel works
[2954.22 --> 2954.86]  in our lives.
[2955.96 --> 2956.88]  And so what does he say?
[2957.50 --> 2958.96]  Well, he's going to invite
[2958.96 --> 2959.98]  the readers to ask,
[2960.80 --> 2962.10]  what does it mean now
[2962.10 --> 2963.78]  to live the Christian life?
[2964.60 --> 2965.76]  What does it mean
[2965.76 --> 2967.34]  to be a Christian?
[2967.34 --> 2968.76]  And he says,
[2968.76 --> 2969.64]  to be a Christian
[2969.64 --> 2971.56]  means that you are
[2971.56 --> 2973.76]  dead to sin.
[2974.48 --> 2976.04]  You are dead to sin.
[2976.60 --> 2977.62]  See, notice in verse 2.
[2978.90 --> 2979.50]  By no means,
[2979.62 --> 2980.54]  we are those
[2980.54 --> 2982.36]  who have died to sin.
[2982.90 --> 2984.06]  How can we live in it
[2984.06 --> 2984.62]  any longer?
[2986.60 --> 2988.06]  So what is Paul saying here?
[2989.12 --> 2990.18]  He's talking about
[2990.18 --> 2991.08]  a very important
[2991.08 --> 2992.32]  theological idea
[2992.32 --> 2994.34]  that will help us
[2994.34 --> 2995.68]  understand our relationship
[2995.68 --> 2997.46]  with sin
[2997.46 --> 2998.86]  and our ongoing
[2998.86 --> 2999.72]  struggle with sin.
[3000.72 --> 3002.36]  He says that there are
[3002.36 --> 3003.70]  two parts
[3003.70 --> 3005.38]  to sanctification.
[3005.84 --> 3005.96]  Okay?
[3006.06 --> 3007.32]  So put them up there
[3007.32 --> 3007.82]  on the screen.
[3009.66 --> 3010.74]  The first part
[3010.74 --> 3011.42]  is called
[3011.42 --> 3013.04]  definitive sanctification
[3013.04 --> 3013.88]  and the second part
[3013.88 --> 3015.26]  is progressive sanctification.
[3015.78 --> 3016.20]  Now I know
[3016.20 --> 3016.90]  maybe you're sitting here
[3016.90 --> 3017.18]  thinking,
[3017.34 --> 3018.06]  I did not come here
[3018.06 --> 3018.86]  to listen about,
[3019.30 --> 3019.58]  you know,
[3019.64 --> 3020.44]  hard words.
[3020.44 --> 3021.68]  But,
[3021.88 --> 3023.54]  too bad,
[3024.42 --> 3026.28]  it's important for us.
[3026.54 --> 3027.74]  So, look,
[3028.04 --> 3029.38]  definitive sanctification
[3029.38 --> 3030.64]  is simply what it says.
[3030.94 --> 3031.70]  It's a definitive
[3031.70 --> 3032.74]  break from sin.
[3033.74 --> 3033.96]  Right?
[3034.02 --> 3034.86]  When you believe
[3034.86 --> 3035.48]  in Jesus,
[3035.82 --> 3037.38]  you died to sin.
[3037.46 --> 3038.36]  There is a break.
[3039.26 --> 3040.20]  There's a break
[3040.20 --> 3041.64]  from a former
[3041.64 --> 3042.52]  way of life
[3042.52 --> 3043.92]  to a new way
[3043.92 --> 3044.44]  of life.
[3044.66 --> 3045.88]  And you are now
[3045.88 --> 3047.34]  declared holy.
[3048.34 --> 3049.72]  You are a
[3049.72 --> 3050.42]  saint.
[3051.50 --> 3052.44]  You have a new
[3052.44 --> 3052.94]  identity
[3052.94 --> 3053.98]  and a new
[3053.98 --> 3054.88]  standing before God.
[3054.98 --> 3055.34]  It's something
[3055.34 --> 3056.24]  that has happened
[3056.24 --> 3057.32]  definitively
[3057.32 --> 3058.90]  once and for all.
[3059.44 --> 3060.46]  The moment you put
[3060.46 --> 3061.08]  your faith in Christ,
[3061.14 --> 3061.82]  you are justified.
[3062.66 --> 3063.58]  You are made right
[3063.58 --> 3064.02]  with God.
[3064.10 --> 3064.68]  You become friends
[3064.68 --> 3065.14]  with God.
[3065.24 --> 3067.02]  You are sanctified
[3067.02 --> 3068.38]  positionally.
[3068.50 --> 3068.80]  You're standing
[3068.80 --> 3069.42]  before God.
[3071.42 --> 3071.86]  Now,
[3072.22 --> 3073.68]  but it does not
[3073.68 --> 3074.46]  mean that Christians
[3074.46 --> 3075.34]  no longer sin.
[3076.34 --> 3076.98]  And if you ever
[3076.98 --> 3077.94]  come across someone
[3077.94 --> 3079.06]  who claims to live
[3079.06 --> 3080.04]  a sinless life,
[3080.50 --> 3081.84]  just ask the people
[3081.84 --> 3082.82]  who live with them
[3082.82 --> 3084.04]  if that's true.
[3085.86 --> 3086.38]  Now,
[3086.42 --> 3087.34]  the second part
[3087.34 --> 3088.02]  is called
[3088.02 --> 3089.58]  progressive sanctification.
[3089.82 --> 3089.94]  So,
[3089.98 --> 3091.04]  there's two aspects.
[3091.76 --> 3092.76]  And progressive,
[3093.10 --> 3093.92]  as it says,
[3093.98 --> 3095.40]  is this ongoing work
[3095.40 --> 3096.42]  of God's grace
[3096.42 --> 3097.06]  in our lives
[3097.06 --> 3098.18]  whereby we put
[3098.18 --> 3099.84]  sin to death
[3099.84 --> 3101.68]  and become
[3101.68 --> 3102.72]  more holy
[3102.72 --> 3103.52]  and more righteous
[3103.52 --> 3105.42]  in our experience
[3105.42 --> 3106.20]  as Christians
[3106.20 --> 3107.20]  over time.
[3107.88 --> 3108.26]  So,
[3108.34 --> 3108.80]  hopefully,
[3109.28 --> 3109.70]  you know,
[3109.76 --> 3110.50]  day to day,
[3110.74 --> 3112.02]  it's hard to see
[3112.02 --> 3113.16]  and sometimes
[3113.16 --> 3113.96]  this process
[3113.96 --> 3114.70]  seems to go up
[3114.70 --> 3115.16]  and down.
[3116.02 --> 3116.62]  But hopefully,
[3116.80 --> 3117.34]  over time,
[3117.40 --> 3117.96]  you look back
[3117.96 --> 3118.44]  on your life
[3118.44 --> 3118.68]  and say,
[3118.80 --> 3119.58]  look at the way,
[3120.02 --> 3120.56]  by God's grace,
[3120.62 --> 3121.18]  I have grown.
[3121.76 --> 3122.34]  I have become
[3122.34 --> 3122.90]  more holy.
[3123.02 --> 3123.54]  I have conquered
[3123.54 --> 3124.14]  this sin.
[3124.26 --> 3125.58]  I'm living more,
[3126.32 --> 3127.22]  obeying his will
[3127.22 --> 3128.00]  more and more.
[3128.62 --> 3129.34]  This is kind of
[3129.34 --> 3130.04]  our goal, right?
[3130.08 --> 3131.40]  To grow in holiness,
[3131.40 --> 3132.10]  to become more
[3132.10 --> 3132.62]  and more like
[3132.62 --> 3134.10]  our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3134.66 --> 3135.04]  So,
[3135.16 --> 3135.82]  definitively,
[3135.96 --> 3137.74]  we are sanctified.
[3137.86 --> 3139.14]  We have a standing
[3139.14 --> 3139.80]  before God
[3139.80 --> 3140.56]  where we are holy,
[3141.24 --> 3142.70]  but experientially,
[3142.90 --> 3143.62]  we've got to work
[3143.62 --> 3144.12]  this out
[3144.12 --> 3145.00]  and we grow
[3145.00 --> 3145.48]  in holiness
[3145.48 --> 3146.10]  over time.
[3147.68 --> 3148.14]  So,
[3148.22 --> 3148.38]  again,
[3148.44 --> 3148.82]  there's this
[3148.82 --> 3149.72]  definitive break
[3149.72 --> 3150.30]  from sin.
[3150.40 --> 3151.90]  You died to sin,
[3152.02 --> 3152.50]  Paul says,
[3152.60 --> 3153.32]  past tense.
[3153.44 --> 3154.04]  This has happened.
[3154.88 --> 3156.90]  Your primary identity
[3156.90 --> 3157.60]  is no longer
[3157.60 --> 3158.56]  that you are a sinner.
[3159.26 --> 3159.62]  Now,
[3159.80 --> 3161.38]  your primary identity
[3161.38 --> 3162.98]  is that you are holy.
[3164.54 --> 3164.98]  So,
[3165.04 --> 3165.50]  this morning,
[3165.72 --> 3166.68]  think of yourselves,
[3168.36 --> 3169.04]  yes,
[3169.10 --> 3169.86]  I struggle with sin,
[3169.96 --> 3171.04]  but I am not
[3171.04 --> 3172.68]  primarily a sinner.
[3172.92 --> 3173.70]  I am primarily
[3173.70 --> 3174.98]  a saint.
[3175.36 --> 3176.40]  I am holy.
[3177.08 --> 3177.86]  That's who you are.
[3178.88 --> 3179.36]  And yes,
[3179.42 --> 3180.08]  you still sin.
[3180.78 --> 3181.82]  Much of the Christian life
[3181.82 --> 3183.00]  is about fighting
[3183.00 --> 3184.82]  against indwelling sin
[3184.82 --> 3186.00]  and living into
[3186.00 --> 3187.56]  this new identity
[3187.56 --> 3188.28]  that we have.
[3188.28 --> 3189.60]  Now,
[3189.66 --> 3190.60]  Paul goes on
[3190.60 --> 3191.74]  to tell us
[3191.74 --> 3192.70]  how this happened,
[3192.86 --> 3194.44]  how we have died
[3194.44 --> 3194.96]  to sin
[3194.96 --> 3195.64]  and how we got
[3195.64 --> 3196.44]  this new identity.
[3197.10 --> 3197.90]  And he tells us
[3197.90 --> 3198.54]  in verse 3.
[3199.54 --> 3199.90]  Now,
[3200.16 --> 3200.96]  it can seem like
[3200.96 --> 3201.86]  a kind of a shocking
[3201.86 --> 3202.56]  transition,
[3203.02 --> 3203.86]  but he goes on
[3203.86 --> 3205.08]  to speak about baptism.
[3205.88 --> 3206.60]  He says,
[3206.60 --> 3219.06]  Paul wants us here
[3219.06 --> 3219.82]  to think about
[3219.82 --> 3221.04]  our baptism
[3221.04 --> 3222.54]  and the meaning
[3222.54 --> 3223.56]  of baptism.
[3223.56 --> 3224.68]  Now,
[3224.84 --> 3225.28]  baptism,
[3225.58 --> 3226.12]  as you know,
[3226.24 --> 3227.28]  signifies a whole
[3227.28 --> 3228.46]  bunch of things.
[3229.04 --> 3230.04]  We know that baptism
[3230.04 --> 3231.28]  certainly symbolizes
[3231.28 --> 3232.10]  the washing away
[3232.10 --> 3232.78]  of our sins.
[3234.20 --> 3234.68]  But,
[3234.82 --> 3235.48]  and this might be
[3235.48 --> 3236.30]  new to you,
[3236.38 --> 3237.02]  it's interesting,
[3237.90 --> 3239.28]  the fundamental thing
[3239.28 --> 3240.02]  about baptism,
[3240.20 --> 3240.32]  right,
[3240.40 --> 3242.00]  the fundamental meaning
[3242.00 --> 3242.62]  of baptism
[3242.62 --> 3244.22]  is that in our baptism,
[3244.88 --> 3245.82]  God promised
[3245.82 --> 3247.60]  to unite us
[3247.60 --> 3248.34]  to Jesus
[3248.34 --> 3249.28]  in a special
[3249.28 --> 3250.06]  kind of relationship.
[3251.06 --> 3251.88]  In your baptism,
[3252.06 --> 3252.66]  Jesus promised
[3252.66 --> 3253.94]  to unite you
[3253.94 --> 3254.78]  to Jesus.
[3255.52 --> 3256.10]  And that's why
[3256.10 --> 3256.60]  he says
[3256.60 --> 3257.24]  we are baptized
[3257.24 --> 3260.60]  into Christ Jesus.
[3261.12 --> 3262.30]  Not because of Christ,
[3262.38 --> 3263.12]  not from Christ,
[3263.18 --> 3263.82]  not anything else.
[3263.86 --> 3264.44]  We're baptized
[3264.44 --> 3266.98]  into Christ Jesus.
[3268.08 --> 3268.42]  And so,
[3268.46 --> 3269.20]  it's a relationship
[3269.20 --> 3270.84]  where God takes us
[3270.84 --> 3272.20]  and puts us
[3272.20 --> 3273.00]  into Christ.
[3273.62 --> 3274.70]  He unites us
[3274.70 --> 3275.14]  to Jesus
[3275.14 --> 3275.76]  so that in some
[3275.76 --> 3276.68]  mysterious way,
[3276.80 --> 3277.64]  Jesus shares
[3277.64 --> 3278.72]  his life
[3278.72 --> 3279.76]  with us.
[3280.54 --> 3281.40]  Paul is talking
[3281.40 --> 3282.48]  about this idea
[3282.48 --> 3284.32]  union with Christ.
[3284.88 --> 3285.76]  Union with Christ,
[3285.84 --> 3286.02]  okay?
[3286.22 --> 3287.04]  Let me give you
[3287.04 --> 3288.04]  an illustration
[3288.04 --> 3289.06]  of how Christ
[3289.06 --> 3290.48]  shares his life
[3290.48 --> 3290.88]  with us.
[3291.66 --> 3292.42]  And it's an illustration
[3292.42 --> 3293.38]  that comes from the Bible
[3293.38 --> 3294.78]  that the Bible
[3294.78 --> 3295.54]  actually uses
[3295.54 --> 3296.92]  because the Bible
[3296.92 --> 3297.54]  talks about
[3297.54 --> 3298.22]  our union
[3298.22 --> 3298.82]  with Christ
[3298.82 --> 3300.26]  as a marriage union,
[3300.80 --> 3301.78]  as a marriage union.
[3302.10 --> 3303.28]  So that Christ is,
[3303.36 --> 3304.12]  as we said earlier,
[3304.84 --> 3306.24]  our bridegroom
[3306.24 --> 3307.24]  and we are his bride.
[3307.86 --> 3308.90]  And we're married
[3308.90 --> 3309.56]  to Christ.
[3309.56 --> 3309.68]  Christ.
[3310.28 --> 3310.74]  Now,
[3310.82 --> 3311.28]  when Christy
[3311.28 --> 3312.06]  and I got married,
[3312.54 --> 3313.28]  we were,
[3313.80 --> 3314.94]  financially speaking,
[3315.16 --> 3316.48]  kind of on even footing.
[3316.72 --> 3317.34]  Sometimes people
[3317.34 --> 3318.18]  enter into a marriage
[3318.18 --> 3319.38]  with a lot of debt.
[3319.80 --> 3320.40]  Someone has maybe
[3320.40 --> 3321.06]  a lot of money.
[3321.50 --> 3322.62]  That's great for them.
[3323.46 --> 3324.82]  But we kind of came in
[3324.82 --> 3325.46]  on equal footing
[3325.46 --> 3326.38]  in that we both
[3326.38 --> 3327.12]  didn't have any money.
[3328.08 --> 3329.38]  So we got married
[3329.38 --> 3331.38]  right out of university.
[3331.82 --> 3332.40]  We were young.
[3332.52 --> 3333.22]  Neither of us
[3333.22 --> 3333.84]  had any money.
[3334.08 --> 3334.94]  Our savings account
[3334.94 --> 3335.62]  was like that.
[3335.62 --> 3338.40]  But I also,
[3338.74 --> 3339.54]  positively,
[3339.70 --> 3340.26]  neither of us
[3340.26 --> 3340.94]  had any debts.
[3341.34 --> 3342.28]  We were fortunate
[3342.28 --> 3343.08]  that our parents
[3343.08 --> 3344.88]  paid for our education.
[3346.22 --> 3347.26]  But one thing
[3347.26 --> 3348.20]  I had
[3348.20 --> 3348.74]  that Christy
[3348.74 --> 3349.36]  did not have
[3349.36 --> 3350.18]  was a vehicle.
[3350.88 --> 3352.08]  I had a green
[3352.08 --> 3353.14]  Ford Explorer.
[3354.02 --> 3355.02]  I love this car.
[3355.12 --> 3355.64]  It was recalled
[3355.64 --> 3356.24]  a couple times.
[3356.50 --> 3357.22]  But it was great.
[3357.56 --> 3358.24]  And it got me
[3358.24 --> 3358.88]  through the snow
[3358.88 --> 3359.72]  living in Vermont.
[3360.40 --> 3361.64]  And it was my first car
[3361.64 --> 3362.32]  and I loved it.
[3362.66 --> 3362.88]  Now,
[3362.96 --> 3363.34]  what happened
[3363.34 --> 3364.00]  when we got married?
[3364.00 --> 3365.20]  Well,
[3365.24 --> 3365.92]  when we got married,
[3366.04 --> 3367.50]  suddenly my car
[3367.50 --> 3368.92]  became
[3368.92 --> 3370.50]  Christy's car.
[3371.66 --> 3372.66]  It's called sharing.
[3374.22 --> 3375.14]  Because our life
[3375.14 --> 3375.80]  is now shared.
[3376.02 --> 3377.26]  And it had everything
[3377.26 --> 3378.70]  to do with our union.
[3379.52 --> 3380.28]  Our marriage union.
[3381.04 --> 3381.26]  Now,
[3381.32 --> 3381.92]  something similar
[3381.92 --> 3382.88]  happens in baptism.
[3383.50 --> 3384.74]  Except far greater,
[3384.90 --> 3385.38]  of course,
[3385.46 --> 3385.82]  than that.
[3386.20 --> 3386.36]  You know,
[3386.38 --> 3387.14]  when we are baptized
[3387.14 --> 3387.76]  into Christ,
[3387.82 --> 3388.16]  when we are,
[3388.30 --> 3388.56]  in a sense,
[3388.68 --> 3389.88]  married to Christ,
[3390.06 --> 3391.18]  all of the blessings,
[3391.38 --> 3392.24]  all the benefits
[3392.24 --> 3394.12]  that are in Jesus Christ
[3394.12 --> 3395.42]  now become ours.
[3396.44 --> 3397.52]  Because we're in him.
[3397.64 --> 3398.00]  We get
[3398.00 --> 3400.04]  all of our debts,
[3400.14 --> 3401.22]  our record of sin,
[3402.18 --> 3403.14]  become his.
[3404.98 --> 3407.00]  And all of his righteousness,
[3407.28 --> 3408.16]  his record
[3408.16 --> 3409.42]  of obedience,
[3409.86 --> 3411.10]  his moral purity
[3411.10 --> 3411.82]  and beauty
[3411.82 --> 3413.32]  of his life
[3413.32 --> 3414.84]  becomes ours.
[3415.58 --> 3416.90]  Because we're married to him.
[3417.46 --> 3418.74]  In our union with Christ,
[3418.74 --> 3419.66]  Jesus shares
[3419.66 --> 3420.98]  his life with us.
[3422.22 --> 3423.76]  But it goes far deeper
[3423.76 --> 3424.48]  than that even.
[3425.24 --> 3426.20]  Because Paul goes on
[3426.20 --> 3426.74]  to say that
[3426.74 --> 3428.00]  when we are united
[3428.00 --> 3429.54]  to Christ by faith,
[3429.70 --> 3430.90]  we are united to him
[3430.90 --> 3431.98]  in such a close
[3431.98 --> 3433.10]  and intimate way
[3433.10 --> 3434.48]  that when Jesus
[3434.48 --> 3435.64]  died on the cross,
[3436.36 --> 3437.98]  you died on the cross.
[3438.48 --> 3439.70]  When he was buried,
[3440.12 --> 3440.92]  you were buried.
[3441.02 --> 3442.02]  When he rose again,
[3442.34 --> 3443.24]  you rose again.
[3443.36 --> 3444.54]  I love this little hand thing.
[3444.84 --> 3445.78]  United to Christ.
[3446.46 --> 3447.06]  He died,
[3447.80 --> 3448.46]  you died with him.
[3448.46 --> 3449.14]  He rose.
[3449.74 --> 3450.54]  You rose with him.
[3451.14 --> 3451.76]  Just like that.
[3453.24 --> 3453.66]  So,
[3453.82 --> 3455.10]  what happened to Jesus?
[3455.96 --> 3456.78]  Everything that
[3456.78 --> 3457.48]  he did,
[3457.56 --> 3458.84]  everything that he experienced
[3458.84 --> 3460.04]  also happened
[3460.04 --> 3461.30]  to us.
[3462.04 --> 3462.42]  So,
[3462.52 --> 3463.10]  look at
[3463.10 --> 3463.90]  verse 3 again,
[3463.98 --> 3464.88]  that last part there.
[3465.80 --> 3466.80]  Or don't you know
[3466.80 --> 3467.56]  that all of us
[3467.56 --> 3468.14]  who are baptized
[3468.14 --> 3469.34]  into Christ Jesus
[3469.34 --> 3470.92]  were baptized
[3470.92 --> 3473.34]  into his death?
[3474.68 --> 3475.32]  So,
[3475.42 --> 3476.58]  what does baptism represent?
[3476.58 --> 3479.26]  It represents
[3479.26 --> 3480.12]  a type of death.
[3481.08 --> 3481.66]  I don't know
[3481.66 --> 3482.12]  if you ever think
[3482.12 --> 3483.20]  about baptism as that,
[3483.26 --> 3484.66]  but it is a death ceremony.
[3485.76 --> 3486.38]  In baptism,
[3486.64 --> 3487.18]  you die.
[3488.70 --> 3489.20]  And actually,
[3489.36 --> 3490.26]  in the ancient world,
[3490.38 --> 3491.42]  the word baptizo
[3491.42 --> 3492.74]  was a word
[3492.74 --> 3493.36]  that was used
[3493.36 --> 3494.12]  in the first century
[3494.12 --> 3495.50]  to describe things like
[3495.50 --> 3496.34]  a ship
[3496.34 --> 3497.14]  that sinks
[3497.14 --> 3498.86]  and of people
[3498.86 --> 3499.64]  being drowned
[3499.64 --> 3501.08]  from the waters
[3501.08 --> 3502.06]  overflowing them.
[3503.28 --> 3504.22]  And we see this
[3504.22 --> 3504.76]  in the crossing
[3504.76 --> 3505.48]  of the Red Sea
[3505.48 --> 3506.66]  when the waters
[3506.66 --> 3507.74]  flood over
[3507.74 --> 3508.70]  the Egyptian army
[3508.70 --> 3509.40]  that is chasing
[3509.40 --> 3510.10]  God's people,
[3510.42 --> 3510.80]  they are,
[3510.92 --> 3511.92]  in a manner of speaking,
[3512.36 --> 3512.70]  baptized
[3512.70 --> 3514.66]  but not raised to life.
[3516.26 --> 3517.32]  Whereas God's people
[3517.32 --> 3518.46]  come through the waters
[3518.46 --> 3519.90]  into new life
[3519.90 --> 3521.50]  and they are just sprinkled.
[3523.00 --> 3524.04]  Whereas the Egyptians
[3524.04 --> 3524.72]  were immersed.
[3525.08 --> 3525.28]  Aha.
[3525.28 --> 3526.92]  That's okay.
[3528.14 --> 3529.08]  So baptism,
[3529.60 --> 3530.28]  one of the things
[3530.28 --> 3530.90]  that it represents
[3530.90 --> 3531.66]  is death.
[3531.74 --> 3532.64]  It is death.
[3532.94 --> 3533.48]  And you read
[3533.48 --> 3534.62]  the gospel accounts
[3534.62 --> 3536.48]  where Jesus speaks
[3536.48 --> 3538.00]  about a baptism
[3538.00 --> 3539.62]  that he is going
[3539.62 --> 3540.08]  to undergo.
[3540.40 --> 3541.04]  Remember that?
[3541.40 --> 3542.52]  Mark chapter 10
[3542.52 --> 3543.66]  verse 35.
[3544.24 --> 3544.78]  Jesus says
[3544.78 --> 3545.58]  to his disciples,
[3546.52 --> 3549.02]  you don't know
[3549.02 --> 3550.04]  what you are asking.
[3550.40 --> 3550.90]  Jesus said,
[3551.00 --> 3551.70]  can you drink
[3551.70 --> 3552.74]  the cup I drink
[3552.74 --> 3554.52]  or be baptized?
[3555.28 --> 3556.80]  With the baptism
[3556.80 --> 3558.14]  I am baptized
[3558.14 --> 3559.32]  with.
[3560.66 --> 3561.80]  He's speaking about
[3561.80 --> 3562.58]  his death
[3562.58 --> 3563.30]  on the cross.
[3563.56 --> 3564.04]  Right?
[3564.08 --> 3564.78]  Where the judgment
[3564.78 --> 3566.34]  and the wrath of God
[3566.34 --> 3567.66]  flood over
[3567.66 --> 3568.44]  our Savior
[3568.44 --> 3569.56]  on the cross.
[3569.64 --> 3570.46]  He is baptized.
[3570.92 --> 3571.84]  It's a type of baptism.
[3572.38 --> 3573.42]  And when Jesus died
[3573.42 --> 3574.00]  on the cross,
[3574.16 --> 3576.08]  we also were baptized
[3576.08 --> 3578.30]  into his death.
[3578.30 --> 3580.52]  But not only that,
[3581.00 --> 3582.66]  notice that baptism
[3582.66 --> 3584.28]  is also a burial
[3584.28 --> 3585.24]  in verse 4
[3585.24 --> 3586.06]  of Romans 6.
[3587.14 --> 3588.08]  The next verse,
[3588.22 --> 3589.06]  we were therefore
[3589.06 --> 3590.36]  buried with him
[3590.36 --> 3591.14]  through baptism
[3591.14 --> 3591.80]  into death.
[3593.10 --> 3593.62]  Okay, and of course
[3593.62 --> 3595.22]  when Jesus was buried,
[3595.94 --> 3597.72]  it wasn't six feet under
[3597.72 --> 3598.02]  like,
[3598.44 --> 3599.18]  or whatever it is,
[3599.24 --> 3600.10]  like we do today
[3600.10 --> 3600.92]  in our custom,
[3601.42 --> 3602.60]  he was entombed.
[3603.12 --> 3603.38]  Right?
[3603.46 --> 3604.04]  So he was put
[3604.04 --> 3606.08]  into a tomb
[3606.08 --> 3606.86]  that was not underground,
[3606.98 --> 3607.26]  it was kind of
[3607.26 --> 3608.28]  into the side of a rock
[3608.28 --> 3608.82]  or a mountain.
[3609.28 --> 3609.42]  Right?
[3609.46 --> 3609.90]  And it was covered.
[3610.88 --> 3612.24]  So when Jesus was put
[3612.24 --> 3613.18]  into the tomb though,
[3613.32 --> 3615.36]  we were entombed
[3615.36 --> 3616.40]  with Christ.
[3617.68 --> 3618.28]  And so not only
[3618.28 --> 3619.12]  did we die with him
[3619.12 --> 3619.62]  on the cross,
[3619.76 --> 3621.62]  we were buried with him.
[3621.68 --> 3622.44]  We were entombed
[3622.44 --> 3622.92]  with him.
[3623.00 --> 3624.18]  And that is very important
[3624.18 --> 3625.94]  that not only
[3625.94 --> 3626.84]  did we die with him
[3626.84 --> 3627.26]  on the cross,
[3627.30 --> 3627.98]  but that we were
[3627.98 --> 3628.92]  entombed with him
[3628.92 --> 3631.02]  because we also need
[3631.02 --> 3632.16]  to be raised with him.
[3632.82 --> 3633.94]  So notice that
[3633.94 --> 3634.94]  death and burial
[3634.94 --> 3636.06]  leads to resurrection.
[3636.06 --> 3636.14]  resurrection,
[3636.84 --> 3637.24]  again,
[3637.40 --> 3638.42]  as we continue
[3638.42 --> 3639.08]  in verse four.
[3639.78 --> 3640.38]  We were therefore
[3640.38 --> 3641.40]  buried with him
[3641.40 --> 3642.10]  through baptism
[3642.10 --> 3642.86]  into death.
[3643.40 --> 3643.62]  Why?
[3644.94 --> 3646.28]  In order that,
[3646.92 --> 3647.78]  just as Christ
[3647.78 --> 3648.38]  was raised
[3648.38 --> 3649.22]  from the dead
[3649.22 --> 3649.94]  through the glory
[3649.94 --> 3650.52]  of the Father,
[3651.06 --> 3652.04]  we too
[3652.04 --> 3654.02]  may live a new life.
[3655.86 --> 3655.98]  Right?
[3656.04 --> 3656.78]  So Paul is saying
[3656.78 --> 3658.06]  that if we are
[3658.06 --> 3659.40]  in Christ Jesus,
[3659.54 --> 3660.58]  united to Christ,
[3660.58 --> 3661.88]  we not only died
[3661.88 --> 3662.36]  with him
[3662.36 --> 3663.28]  and we're buried
[3663.28 --> 3663.88]  with him,
[3664.38 --> 3665.14]  but he shares
[3665.14 --> 3665.74]  his resurrection
[3665.74 --> 3666.64]  life with us.
[3668.22 --> 3669.82]  It is not only true
[3669.82 --> 3671.38]  that we will rise
[3671.38 --> 3672.88]  bodily on the last day
[3672.88 --> 3674.30]  like Christ rose bodily,
[3674.50 --> 3675.22]  and that is true,
[3675.32 --> 3675.96]  that will happen,
[3676.42 --> 3677.50]  but this is about
[3677.50 --> 3678.48]  our experience
[3678.48 --> 3679.46]  as Christians
[3679.46 --> 3680.18]  today,
[3680.36 --> 3681.26]  in the present.
[3683.00 --> 3684.16]  So let me give you
[3684.16 --> 3685.28]  another illustration.
[3685.98 --> 3686.96]  But instead of a wedding,
[3687.22 --> 3687.70]  think about
[3687.70 --> 3689.18]  plant life.
[3690.18 --> 3690.36]  Okay,
[3690.36 --> 3690.92]  plant life.
[3691.34 --> 3692.08]  This is an image
[3692.08 --> 3692.92]  that Jesus uses
[3692.92 --> 3694.74]  in John chapter 15
[3694.74 --> 3695.28]  verse 5.
[3696.38 --> 3697.26]  It is very familiar
[3697.26 --> 3697.88]  to us
[3697.88 --> 3698.70]  if you're a Christian.
[3698.92 --> 3699.34]  He says,
[3700.00 --> 3700.80]  I am the vine,
[3700.94 --> 3701.82]  you are the branches.
[3702.00 --> 3702.58]  If you,
[3703.16 --> 3704.02]  listen to this language,
[3704.48 --> 3706.04]  remain in me
[3706.04 --> 3707.68]  and I in you,
[3708.00 --> 3709.12]  you will bear much fruit.
[3709.28 --> 3710.22]  Apart from me,
[3710.80 --> 3711.58]  you can do nothing.
[3712.34 --> 3713.58]  So we see the picture here.
[3714.14 --> 3714.62]  Jesus says,
[3714.86 --> 3716.02]  I'm like a vine
[3716.02 --> 3717.20]  and you are like branches
[3717.20 --> 3719.58]  that are united to me.
[3719.58 --> 3720.78]  you are grafted in.
[3721.80 --> 3722.00]  Now,
[3722.04 --> 3722.64]  I don't know much
[3722.64 --> 3723.54]  about plants
[3723.54 --> 3725.32]  and I tend to kill them.
[3726.10 --> 3727.62]  But as I understand it,
[3727.86 --> 3728.70]  a branch
[3728.70 --> 3729.82]  that is connected
[3729.82 --> 3730.78]  to the vine
[3730.78 --> 3732.06]  gets its life
[3732.06 --> 3733.42]  from being connected
[3733.42 --> 3734.38]  to the vine.
[3734.94 --> 3735.78]  And the plant
[3735.78 --> 3736.56]  transfers
[3736.56 --> 3738.40]  its water,
[3738.58 --> 3739.50]  its nutrients
[3739.50 --> 3741.34]  through the vine
[3741.34 --> 3742.50]  to the branches
[3742.50 --> 3743.62]  to then enable
[3743.62 --> 3744.18]  the branch
[3744.18 --> 3744.72]  to grow
[3744.72 --> 3745.40]  and bear fruit.
[3745.40 --> 3745.90]  fruit.
[3746.80 --> 3747.60]  And Jesus says,
[3747.68 --> 3749.28]  in precisely the same way,
[3750.38 --> 3751.76]  Jesus transfers
[3751.76 --> 3753.28]  his life
[3753.28 --> 3754.96]  to each Christian,
[3755.30 --> 3756.40]  to each of us.
[3757.28 --> 3758.62]  And just as the life
[3758.62 --> 3759.58]  of the vine
[3759.58 --> 3761.48]  flows into the branches,
[3762.20 --> 3764.08]  our whole experience
[3764.08 --> 3764.84]  as a Christian,
[3765.26 --> 3766.82]  our whole Christian existence,
[3767.82 --> 3768.62]  comes from him.
[3768.62 --> 3770.42]  Right?
[3771.38 --> 3772.44]  In being
[3772.44 --> 3773.34]  united
[3773.34 --> 3775.52]  in an organic
[3775.52 --> 3776.38]  and a living
[3776.38 --> 3777.44]  union
[3777.44 --> 3778.42]  with Christ.
[3779.26 --> 3779.92]  And so that if
[3779.92 --> 3780.78]  apart from him,
[3780.82 --> 3782.00]  if we are not connected
[3782.00 --> 3782.54]  to Christ,
[3782.60 --> 3784.36]  we cannot do anything
[3784.36 --> 3785.50]  spiritually speaking.
[3785.88 --> 3787.24]  But when we are united
[3787.24 --> 3788.36]  to Christ
[3788.36 --> 3789.48]  in this organic way,
[3789.74 --> 3790.76]  his life flows
[3790.76 --> 3791.40]  into us.
[3791.40 --> 3795.02]  So don't try
[3795.02 --> 3795.58]  to do anything
[3795.58 --> 3796.22]  in the Christian life
[3796.22 --> 3797.20]  apart from Christ.
[3798.62 --> 3799.82]  It doesn't work.
[3800.22 --> 3801.26]  We have to abide
[3801.26 --> 3801.84]  with him.
[3802.58 --> 3803.46]  And so if you are
[3803.46 --> 3803.90]  a Christian,
[3804.00 --> 3804.66]  what does this mean?
[3805.12 --> 3805.76]  It means
[3805.76 --> 3806.84]  that Jesus
[3806.84 --> 3807.54]  is not just
[3807.54 --> 3808.06]  your teacher.
[3809.02 --> 3809.84]  He is not just
[3809.84 --> 3810.62]  someone you follow
[3810.62 --> 3811.78]  and it is even
[3811.78 --> 3812.32]  the case that
[3812.32 --> 3813.06]  he is not just
[3813.06 --> 3813.62]  your savior.
[3814.58 --> 3815.40]  He is all
[3815.40 --> 3816.18]  of those things,
[3816.64 --> 3817.48]  but never forget
[3817.48 --> 3818.00]  that Jesus
[3818.00 --> 3819.08]  is also the one
[3819.08 --> 3820.20]  who continually
[3820.20 --> 3822.66]  gives you life
[3822.66 --> 3824.12]  every single moment.
[3825.00 --> 3825.92]  Every single moment
[3825.92 --> 3827.70]  he gives you life.
[3828.92 --> 3829.70]  He is the one
[3829.70 --> 3830.48]  who continually
[3830.48 --> 3831.30]  nourishes you
[3831.30 --> 3832.02]  with his grace.
[3832.48 --> 3832.86]  He is the one
[3832.86 --> 3833.56]  that continually
[3833.56 --> 3834.70]  imparts his power
[3834.70 --> 3835.26]  to you
[3835.26 --> 3836.56]  and renews you
[3836.56 --> 3838.18]  and through that
[3838.18 --> 3838.94]  bears fruit
[3838.94 --> 3839.54]  in your life.
[3840.66 --> 3841.50]  And it means
[3841.50 --> 3842.10]  that the entire,
[3842.24 --> 3842.80]  the center
[3842.80 --> 3843.78]  of the Christian life
[3843.78 --> 3845.18]  is a relationship
[3845.18 --> 3846.06]  with Jesus.
[3847.20 --> 3847.42]  Right?
[3847.46 --> 3847.98]  It is not just
[3847.98 --> 3849.38]  about going to church
[3849.38 --> 3850.30]  or even being
[3850.30 --> 3850.66]  baptized.
[3851.00 --> 3851.48]  It is not just
[3851.48 --> 3852.84]  about our emotional
[3852.84 --> 3853.98]  response or our
[3853.98 --> 3855.04]  intellectual response.
[3855.32 --> 3856.12]  The center of the
[3856.12 --> 3856.72]  Christian life
[3856.72 --> 3857.72]  is a relationship,
[3858.52 --> 3859.62]  union with Jesus
[3859.62 --> 3860.06]  Christ.
[3860.46 --> 3861.34]  This is the deepest
[3861.34 --> 3862.14]  way that we can
[3862.14 --> 3863.00]  think about ourselves
[3863.00 --> 3863.42]  today.
[3864.44 --> 3864.84]  That you,
[3865.70 --> 3866.14]  when you think
[3866.14 --> 3866.70]  about yourself
[3866.70 --> 3867.18]  to say,
[3867.62 --> 3868.30]  I am united
[3868.30 --> 3868.94]  with Christ.
[3869.28 --> 3869.92]  That is what Paul
[3869.92 --> 3870.56]  would have us do.
[3871.32 --> 3872.30]  I have union
[3872.30 --> 3873.18]  with Christ.
[3873.78 --> 3874.46]  That is what the
[3874.46 --> 3874.82]  Christian life
[3874.82 --> 3875.36]  is all about.
[3875.36 --> 3877.30]  And because
[3877.30 --> 3878.34]  of our union
[3878.34 --> 3878.88]  with Christ,
[3878.96 --> 3879.48]  there is no such
[3879.48 --> 3880.22]  thing as
[3880.22 --> 3881.30]  justification
[3881.30 --> 3883.26]  without sanctification.
[3883.92 --> 3884.50]  There is no such
[3884.50 --> 3885.22]  thing as being
[3885.22 --> 3885.88]  redeemed
[3885.88 --> 3887.14]  without being
[3887.14 --> 3887.62]  renewed.
[3888.68 --> 3889.06]  And so the
[3889.06 --> 3889.42]  gospel,
[3889.66 --> 3890.10]  the invitation
[3890.10 --> 3891.20]  is to come
[3891.20 --> 3892.12]  as you are.
[3892.78 --> 3893.30]  We don't bring
[3893.30 --> 3894.36]  anything in our
[3894.36 --> 3894.84]  hands to be
[3894.84 --> 3895.54]  justified before
[3895.54 --> 3895.92]  God,
[3896.00 --> 3896.64]  but you don't
[3896.64 --> 3897.58]  stay as you
[3897.58 --> 3897.88]  are.
[3898.42 --> 3899.06]  You grow.
[3899.24 --> 3899.92]  You change.
[3900.00 --> 3900.72]  You are transformed
[3900.72 --> 3902.10]  by grace.
[3902.10 --> 3904.50]  And the way
[3904.50 --> 3905.28]  God transforms
[3905.28 --> 3906.94]  us is that
[3906.94 --> 3907.92]  Jesus shares
[3907.92 --> 3908.92]  the power
[3908.92 --> 3909.68]  of his
[3909.68 --> 3910.28]  resurrection
[3910.28 --> 3911.22]  with us
[3911.22 --> 3911.54]  now,
[3911.60 --> 3912.18]  so that we
[3912.18 --> 3913.24]  now walk
[3913.24 --> 3913.98]  in newness
[3913.98 --> 3914.50]  of life.
[3915.48 --> 3915.58]  Right?
[3915.66 --> 3916.22]  So whereas
[3916.22 --> 3916.96]  once you
[3916.96 --> 3917.68]  walked in
[3917.68 --> 3918.90]  ungodliness,
[3919.42 --> 3920.50]  now you
[3920.50 --> 3921.04]  walk in
[3921.04 --> 3921.48]  godliness.
[3922.66 --> 3923.50]  Instead of
[3923.50 --> 3924.02]  lying,
[3924.72 --> 3925.16]  you speak
[3925.16 --> 3925.76]  the truth.
[3926.56 --> 3927.14]  Instead of
[3927.14 --> 3927.66]  worshiping
[3927.66 --> 3928.08]  yourself,
[3928.22 --> 3928.64]  you worship
[3928.64 --> 3929.04]  God.
[3929.70 --> 3930.22]  Instead of
[3930.22 --> 3930.94]  hating others,
[3930.94 --> 3931.74]  you love
[3931.74 --> 3932.20]  others.
[3932.34 --> 3932.80]  Instead of
[3932.80 --> 3933.38]  holding a
[3933.38 --> 3933.82]  grudge,
[3934.06 --> 3934.54]  you forgive.
[3935.82 --> 3936.68]  This is the
[3936.68 --> 3937.82]  new life that
[3937.82 --> 3938.30]  he's talking
[3938.30 --> 3938.66]  about.
[3939.64 --> 3939.76]  Now,
[3939.86 --> 3940.04]  well,
[3940.18 --> 3940.92]  lastly in
[3940.92 --> 3941.38]  verse 5,
[3941.50 --> 3941.98]  Paul sort
[3941.98 --> 3942.14]  of,
[3942.28 --> 3943.62]  he reemphasizes
[3943.62 --> 3944.98]  that death
[3944.98 --> 3945.42]  leads to
[3945.42 --> 3945.88]  resurrection.
[3946.04 --> 3946.36]  It leads to
[3946.36 --> 3946.78]  new life,
[3946.98 --> 3947.30]  where he
[3947.30 --> 3947.62]  says,
[3948.14 --> 3949.10]  for if we
[3949.10 --> 3949.66]  have been
[3949.66 --> 3950.34]  united with
[3950.34 --> 3950.96]  him in a
[3950.96 --> 3951.36]  death like
[3951.36 --> 3951.70]  his,
[3951.90 --> 3952.54]  we will
[3952.54 --> 3953.28]  certainly
[3953.28 --> 3954.34]  also be
[3954.34 --> 3955.04]  united with
[3955.04 --> 3956.24]  him in
[3956.24 --> 3957.00]  a resurrection
[3957.00 --> 3958.16]  like his.
[3959.56 --> 3959.94]  And so you
[3959.94 --> 3960.08]  see,
[3960.20 --> 3960.76]  everything that
[3960.76 --> 3961.52]  happens in
[3961.52 --> 3962.72]  happens to
[3962.72 --> 3963.16]  Christ,
[3963.28 --> 3963.42]  right?
[3963.48 --> 3963.76]  From the
[3963.76 --> 3964.22]  cross,
[3964.74 --> 3965.20]  to the
[3965.20 --> 3965.58]  tomb,
[3965.74 --> 3966.10]  to the
[3966.10 --> 3966.54]  resurrection,
[3966.78 --> 3967.12]  to the
[3967.12 --> 3967.58]  ascension,
[3967.74 --> 3968.06]  to being
[3968.06 --> 3968.64]  seated in
[3968.64 --> 3969.00]  glory,
[3969.66 --> 3970.44]  to his
[3970.44 --> 3971.62]  return in
[3971.62 --> 3972.08]  a resurrected
[3972.08 --> 3972.54]  body,
[3972.66 --> 3973.32]  all of that
[3973.32 --> 3974.10]  becomes true
[3974.10 --> 3974.70]  of you
[3974.70 --> 3976.32]  because of
[3976.32 --> 3976.78]  our union
[3976.78 --> 3977.42]  with Christ,
[3977.50 --> 3977.96]  and that is
[3977.96 --> 3978.32]  the Christian
[3978.32 --> 3978.70]  faith.
[3980.06 --> 3980.26]  Well,
[3980.28 --> 3980.80]  let me close
[3980.80 --> 3981.18]  with one
[3981.18 --> 3982.22]  point of
[3982.22 --> 3982.68]  application.
[3982.68 --> 3982.74]  salvation.
[3985.68 --> 3986.30]  I don't
[3986.30 --> 3986.70]  know how
[3986.70 --> 3987.20]  often you
[3987.20 --> 3987.60]  think about
[3987.60 --> 3988.20]  your baptism.
[3989.30 --> 3990.00]  For a lot
[3990.00 --> 3990.48]  of us,
[3990.72 --> 3991.62]  we might
[3991.62 --> 3992.32]  not even
[3992.32 --> 3993.14]  remember our
[3993.14 --> 3993.86]  baptism because
[3993.86 --> 3994.20]  we were
[3994.20 --> 3995.76]  baptized quite
[3995.76 --> 3996.04]  young.
[3997.04 --> 3997.58]  Others of
[3997.58 --> 3997.76]  us,
[3997.88 --> 3998.62]  maybe we
[3998.62 --> 3999.20]  remember our
[3999.20 --> 3999.80]  baptism quite
[3999.80 --> 4000.26]  vividly.
[4000.34 --> 4000.56]  It didn't
[4000.56 --> 4001.00]  happen that
[4001.00 --> 4001.50]  long ago.
[4002.68 --> 4003.30]  But my
[4003.30 --> 4003.86]  guess is,
[4003.94 --> 4004.50]  even if
[4004.50 --> 4004.82]  that's the
[4004.82 --> 4005.30]  case,
[4006.14 --> 4007.04]  probably you
[4007.04 --> 4007.40]  don't think
[4007.40 --> 4007.94]  about it on
[4007.94 --> 4008.50]  a day-to-day
[4008.50 --> 4009.00]  basis.
[4009.00 --> 4010.80]  But Martin
[4010.80 --> 4012.34]  Luther once
[4012.34 --> 4012.78]  said that
[4012.78 --> 4013.66]  upon rising
[4013.66 --> 4014.62]  from bed in
[4014.62 --> 4015.10]  the morning,
[4015.44 --> 4016.34]  Christians should
[4016.34 --> 4017.12]  place their
[4017.12 --> 4018.36]  hand on their
[4018.36 --> 4019.26]  head where
[4019.26 --> 4020.12]  the waters of
[4020.12 --> 4020.88]  baptism washed
[4020.88 --> 4022.56]  over them and
[4022.56 --> 4023.02]  say,
[4023.48 --> 4024.82]  I am a
[4024.82 --> 4025.14]  Christian.
[4027.36 --> 4028.18]  So that's
[4028.18 --> 4028.60]  your homework
[4028.60 --> 4029.84]  this week.
[4030.46 --> 4031.22]  Every morning
[4031.22 --> 4031.68]  when you get
[4031.68 --> 4032.24]  up out of bed,
[4032.32 --> 4032.68]  place your
[4032.68 --> 4033.20]  hand on your
[4033.20 --> 4034.38]  head where
[4034.38 --> 4034.96]  the waters of
[4034.96 --> 4035.74]  baptism once
[4035.74 --> 4036.90]  were washed
[4036.90 --> 4037.34]  over you,
[4037.40 --> 4037.80]  whether you
[4037.80 --> 4038.26]  were a baby
[4038.26 --> 4038.92]  or an adult.
[4039.00 --> 4039.64]  Whether it
[4039.64 --> 4040.24]  was sprinkling
[4040.24 --> 4040.76]  or immersion,
[4040.96 --> 4041.32]  whatever.
[4042.46 --> 4043.16]  And say,
[4043.56 --> 4044.18]  I am a
[4044.18 --> 4044.52]  Christian.
[4047.72 --> 4048.54]  Because in
[4048.54 --> 4049.02]  baptism,
[4049.84 --> 4050.66]  you receive a
[4050.66 --> 4051.12]  new name.
[4052.56 --> 4052.78]  Right?
[4052.86 --> 4053.42]  Your name
[4053.42 --> 4056.28]  now is
[4056.28 --> 4056.78]  Christian.
[4057.98 --> 4058.98]  Baptism is
[4058.98 --> 4059.40]  not only a
[4059.40 --> 4059.96]  death ceremony,
[4060.24 --> 4060.96]  it's a naming
[4060.96 --> 4061.50]  ceremony.
[4062.64 --> 4063.02]  And that
[4063.02 --> 4064.08]  name Christian
[4064.08 --> 4065.94]  is to be on
[4065.94 --> 4066.54]  your heart
[4066.54 --> 4067.40]  and in your
[4067.40 --> 4068.58]  mind where
[4068.58 --> 4069.22]  you remind
[4069.22 --> 4069.86]  yourself that
[4069.86 --> 4070.42]  you have a
[4070.42 --> 4070.88]  new life in
[4070.88 --> 4071.10]  Christ,
[4071.16 --> 4071.40]  that you have
[4071.40 --> 4071.58]  a new
[4071.58 --> 4072.30]  identity in
[4072.30 --> 4072.70]  Christ.
[4073.32 --> 4073.70]  And therefore,
[4073.82 --> 4074.26]  on the basis
[4074.26 --> 4074.76]  of that,
[4075.38 --> 4076.10]  you live in
[4076.10 --> 4076.62]  a new way.
[4077.28 --> 4077.74]  So every
[4077.74 --> 4078.04]  morning,
[4078.14 --> 4078.50]  don't forget
[4078.50 --> 4079.12]  your baptism
[4079.12 --> 4080.62]  because you
[4080.62 --> 4080.96]  have been
[4080.96 --> 4082.10]  baptized into
[4082.10 --> 4082.64]  his death
[4082.64 --> 4083.40]  and into
[4083.40 --> 4084.00]  his resurrection.
[4084.24 --> 4084.62]  So every
[4084.62 --> 4084.96]  day,
[4085.84 --> 4086.20]  place your
[4086.20 --> 4086.50]  hand on
[4086.50 --> 4086.88]  your head
[4086.88 --> 4087.56]  and say,
[4088.20 --> 4088.74]  remember your
[4088.74 --> 4089.12]  baptism,
[4089.42 --> 4089.54]  say,
[4089.64 --> 4090.10]  I am a
[4090.10 --> 4090.40]  Christian.
[4090.40 --> 4091.96]  and let
[4091.96 --> 4092.54]  that change
[4092.54 --> 4092.78]  the way
[4092.78 --> 4093.22]  you live
[4093.22 --> 4094.30]  throughout
[4094.30 --> 4094.72]  the day.
[4095.24 --> 4095.60]  Let's
[4095.60 --> 4095.82]  pray.
[4098.34 --> 4098.86]  Heavenly
[4098.86 --> 4099.18]  Father,

[4122.10 --> 4122.58]  of God
[4122.58 --> 4123.58]  as we
[4123.58 --> 4124.54]  abide with
[4124.54 --> 4124.96]  Christ
[4124.96 --> 4126.20]  through the
[4126.20 --> 4126.66]  Holy Spirit.

[4372.80 --> 4391.90]  So in response to God's word, we have a time where we give of our offerings to the Lord.
[4391.90 --> 4395.10]  And our designated offering today is for World Renew.
[4395.34 --> 4399.54]  It's the relief development agency of our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church.
[4400.06 --> 4403.88]  And specifically, you know, they have different programs, different ministries that they engage in.
[4404.28 --> 4408.98]  And because it's Mother's Day, our focus is on women of hope.
[4409.72 --> 4415.38]  And so actually we're going to watch a short video that gives us an update on the work they've been doing.
[4415.38 --> 4419.94]  As we watch that, may I invite the deacons to collect the morning offering.
[4429.54 --> 4438.06]  Muto ya konza nilipata kudhofika, sikuwa na afya nzuri, nilipata shida.

[4522.24 --> 4526.24]  Muto ya konza nilipata, wakikuwa na kwa watoto wangu.
[4526.24 --> 4532.02]  So we're, you know, very excited and proud to be part of what World Renew does.
[4532.16 --> 4536.30]  And we do so through our prayers, through our giving, through volunteering.
[4536.50 --> 4539.40]  And sometimes we get to go and see and serve.
[4539.40 --> 4545.22]  But let's go ahead and now join together in prayer to our Heavenly Father.
[4545.64 --> 4547.64]  We pray for World Renew and for other things as well.
[4549.98 --> 4559.30]  Lord God, we join with the living creatures and the elders, the saints and the martyrs,
[4559.46 --> 4561.66]  who are gathered around your throne.
[4562.32 --> 4567.90]  And with them saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
[4567.90 --> 4571.58]  who was and is and is to come.
[4572.28 --> 4576.46]  You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[4576.92 --> 4582.06]  For you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.
[4582.88 --> 4586.94]  We thank you, Lord, for the arrival of spring, weather,
[4587.94 --> 4590.48]  and the reminder of your faithfulness through the seasons.
[4590.72 --> 4594.94]  As it says in Psalm 74, you have set all the boundaries of the earth.
[4594.94 --> 4602.50]  Lord, we pray for a good growing season for farmers,
[4602.82 --> 4607.88]  so that there would be plentiful and affordable food for everyone at harvest.
[4608.88 --> 4612.42]  We pray, Lord, for our city of Ladner.
[4613.16 --> 4615.08]  And we pray, Lord, for the many churches here.
[4615.18 --> 4619.50]  We pray that they would all proclaim the gospel in boldness and in love.
[4619.50 --> 4623.74]  So that through that proclamation and that witness,
[4624.50 --> 4627.14]  that many would come to know our Lord Jesus.
[4627.96 --> 4631.22]  Lord, would there be harmony among all believers in the city,
[4631.42 --> 4636.80]  so that many will see the way that we love one another and glorify our Father in heaven.
[4637.76 --> 4645.24]  Lord, we pray that the lost and the searching would find the peace that abounds underneath the wings of our Lord.
[4645.24 --> 4649.22]  Lord, would the lost sheep be brought into your fold.
[4651.14 --> 4657.96]  Lord, we pray for the work of World Renew and their vital ministry of lifting up women around the world
[4657.96 --> 4659.96]  to show them their value and their dignity,
[4660.38 --> 4666.56]  to equip them to work and to lead for the good of themselves and their families and their communities.
[4667.62 --> 4674.10]  Lord, would you continue to bless and strengthen and encourage World Renew staff and workers,
[4674.10 --> 4677.12]  Lord, as they serve you by serving the needs of the world.
[4677.84 --> 4682.90]  Lord, enable them to bear witness to your kingdom and to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[4682.98 --> 4684.16]  who is the King of the nations.
[4686.52 --> 4694.40]  Lord, we recognize and we celebrate a significant moment in the life of our Roman Catholic brothers and sisters.
[4695.20 --> 4699.32]  Lord, we pray that you would bless the new Pope, Pope Leo XIV.
[4699.32 --> 4705.42]  We pray, Lord, that as he provides spiritual leadership to almost a billion and a half people,
[4706.34 --> 4710.36]  that you would guide him unto righteousness and truth and wisdom.
[4712.20 --> 4720.70]  Lord, as we pray for our own church family, we pray that you would, you know, as we think about marriage a bit today,
[4720.78 --> 4724.84]  would you bless and protect our marriages from harm and discord.
[4724.84 --> 4731.48]  Lord, be with those in all stages of their marriages and may spouses serve and love one another,
[4732.22 --> 4734.20]  even as Christ loved the church.
[4735.42 --> 4741.68]  Lord, be with those whose spouses are no longer with us but are in your presence.
[4743.14 --> 4745.90]  Lord, we pray for your comfort and presence with them,
[4746.46 --> 4749.50]  those who still miss their spouses.
[4749.50 --> 4753.18]  We pray especially, Lord, for Katrine as she mourns the loss of Carl.
[4755.30 --> 4756.92]  Finally, Lord, today is Mother's Day.
[4757.78 --> 4761.50]  Lord, we pray for the mothers in our congregation and in our lives.
[4762.00 --> 4764.48]  We thank you, Lord, for the gift of our own mothers,
[4764.98 --> 4769.16]  the ways that they have shown us love and care in Christ's name.
[4770.02 --> 4774.46]  We know, Lord, that you are the one who can change the hearts of our children.
[4774.46 --> 4781.30]  So would you encourage mothers that they are not alone in their love and in their parenting of children
[4781.30 --> 4784.28]  and that your grace is abundant for them.
[4785.06 --> 4790.30]  Lord, would you provide all of our mothers with an extra measure of your patience and fortitude,
[4790.80 --> 4792.76]  with your wisdom and with your joy.
[4794.24 --> 4798.22]  Lord, we remember those who are grieving the loss of mothers or the loss of children
[4798.22 --> 4801.46]  or the opportunity to be mothers themselves.
[4801.64 --> 4802.98]  Lord, please heal the brokenhearted.
[4802.98 --> 4807.72]  We pray for those of us who have difficult or painful or broken relationships
[4807.72 --> 4810.02]  with our mothers or our children.
[4811.02 --> 4812.18]  Lord, bind up our wounds.
[4813.18 --> 4814.28]  Grant us peace and hope.
[4815.26 --> 4817.90]  Bring us and bring, Lord, reconciliation by your will.
[4818.98 --> 4820.06]  Lord, hear our prayers.
[4820.70 --> 4821.46]  In Jesus' name.
[4822.34 --> 4822.62]  Amen.
[4824.16 --> 4825.00]  Let's stand.
[4827.00 --> 4831.64]  And we go out with the grace of the Lord upon us.
[4831.64 --> 4836.70]  Please join us for a time of coffee in the fellowship hall through the doors there
[4836.70 --> 4840.80]  as we get to share a bit about our lives with one another.
[4841.56 --> 4844.68]  And I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4845.52 --> 4849.00]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God the Father,
[4849.40 --> 4853.52]  the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with all of us now and forever.
