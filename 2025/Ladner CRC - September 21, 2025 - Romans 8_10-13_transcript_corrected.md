[360.00 → 367.60] to outreach to children in our community even from other churches who participate so that's coming up
[368.32 → 374.56] we have our Thursday morning coffee is ongoing and men's breakfast is starting up this coming
[374.56 → 382.56] Saturday also you'll see a whole page in our bulletin about our 75th anniversary and so there
[382.56 → 388.48] is actually a sign-up on the foyer table to indicate if you're coming on that Saturday and
[388.48 → 393.44] and we really encourage everyone to come on Saturday to help us celebrate our 75th year
[393.44 → 398.40] anniversary as a church, but we need to know about numbers in order to prepare enough food
[398.40 → 405.60], so please do sign up if you intend to come on the foyer table another thing to let you know is that
[405.60 → 414.16] pastor nancy will actually be leaving I believe on Monday tomorrow for a trip, and she'll be going
[414.16 → 419.84] back home to China to visit her family, but then she'll be going from Beijing to Tel Aviv she'll be
[419.84 → 426.48] going to Israel, and now you know some not all of us would want to travel to Israel at this time
[426.48 → 433.44] but she's part of a group that is going, and they will be touring in Jerusalem and other places and
[433.44 → 438.48] seeing some of the holy land, so please do keep her in your prayers while she's away for the next couple
[438.48 → 449.44] weeks so with that let's turn now to the worship of the lord and as we prepare our hearts this morning
[450.80 → 459.04] I was just kind of thinking about how every week we gather as god's people, and we come, and we gather
[459.04 → 468.32] because Jesus Christ is our shepherd he's the one who gathers us and shepherds us, and you know as
[468.32 → 475.60] we read in psalm 23 he leads us into green pastures he leads us beside still waters he is with us in the
[475.60 → 484.48] midst of the valleys of the shadow of death he anoints our head with oil our cup overflows, and he does all
[484.48 → 492.48] of these things until he will return to make all things new and so let's hear and respond to our shepherd
[492.48 → 497.52] to god's call to worship this morning, and so we'll say this responsibly
[500.08 → 508.80] the lord will pour out his spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men
[508.80 → 516.64] shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions you shall know that the lord is in the midst of
[516.64 → 525.92] his people that he is the lord and there is none else, and it shall come to pass that everyone who
[525.92 → 532.88] calls on the name of the lord shall be saved would you please join me in your hearts in your minds as
[532.88 → 537.20] we come before the lord in a prayer of adoration let's pray together
[537.20 → 547.36] oh lord our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth lord you have set your glory in the heavens
[548.08 → 554.56] and when we consider the heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in
[554.56 → 565.60] place who are we that you are mindful of us and that you care for us but lord you are mindful of us, and you do
[565.60 → 572.56] care for us because at just the right time you sent your beloved son to redeem us so that we might then
[572.56 → 579.92] receive adoption as your sons and daughters and lord you have made us a kingdom and priests to our
[579.92 → 589.12] god and therefore lord we sing, and we shout for joy, and we give you the praise we praise you the lamb who
[589.12 → 596.56] was slain yet who is risen from the dead and seated now at the right hand of the father to you oh lord be
[596.56 → 604.00] long all blessing and honour praise glory and might forever and ever and lord would you be with us this
[604.00 → 610.88] morning in this time of worship as you promise may we worship you this morning in spirit and in truth
[610.88 → 619.60] and all god's people said amen would you please rise and hear god's greeting to us this morning
[620.16 → 626.88] where the lord says grace mercy and peace to you from god our father and the lord Jesus Christ so as
[626.88 → 638.88] the lord has called us and gathered us as his people let's turn and let's welcome one another
[641.20 → 643.28] calm down
[656.80 → 660.88] to the throne

[780.88 → 782.88] Thank you.
[810.88 → 812.88] Thank you.
[812.88 → 814.88] Thank you.
[814.88 → 816.88] Thank you.
[842.88 → 844.88] Thank you.
[844.88 → 846.88] Thank you.
[846.88 → 848.88] Thank you.
[848.88 → 850.88] Thank you.
[850.88 → 852.88] Thank you.
[852.88 → 854.88] Thank you.
[854.88 → 856.88] Thank you.
[856.88 → 858.88] Thank you.
[858.88 → 860.88] Thank you.
[860.88 → 862.88] Thank you.
[862.88 → 864.88] Thank you.
[864.88 → 866.88] Thank you.
[866.88 → 868.88] Thank you.
[868.88 → 870.88] Thank you.
[870.88 → 889.72] Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love.
[889.72 → 898.10] Rights unfold like flowers before Thee, only to the sun above.
[898.10 → 906.34] Will the crowds of sin and sadness Drive the dark of doubt away.
[906.86 → 915.10] River of immortal gladness Fill us with the light of day.
[916.78 → 924.10] All my words with joy so rolling Earth and heaven reflect the rays.
[924.10 → 933.14] Stars and angels sing around Thee, centre of unbroken grace.
[933.60 → 941.24] Field and forest, pale and mountain, Flowery meadow, flashing sea.
[941.74 → 950.10] Tempting burn and flowing fountains, Call us to rejoice with Thee.
[950.10 → 960.10] All our giving and forgiving Ever-blessing, ever-blessed
[960.10 → 968.10] While spring and the joy of living Ocean-tempts of happy rest
[968.10 → 976.86] Thou our Father, Christ our brother, All who live in love are glad.
[976.86 → 985.10] To trust our two love each other Lift us to the joy divine.
[985.10 → 1007.14] So we, this morning, will have a first scripture reading, and that is from the prophet Ezekiel.
[1007.14 → 1012.90] And if you'd like to follow along in your pre-bible, you may.
[1013.04 → 1014.86] I don't see the page number there in our bulletin.
[1015.04 → 1020.70] But it's Ezekiel chapter 18, verses 21 to 32.
[1021.38 → 1024.48] Ezekiel 18, 21 to 32.
[1024.62 → 1025.66] We'll also have it on the screen.
[1025.66 → 1036.04] Okay, so Ezekiel 18, beginning in verse 21.
[1036.04 → 1042.06] But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed
[1042.06 → 1046.24] and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right,
[1046.56 → 1048.40] that person will surely live.
[1048.94 → 1049.86] They will not die.
[1050.76 → 1053.68] None of the offences they have committed will be remembered against them.
[1054.10 → 1057.94] Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.
[1058.58 → 1062.74] Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the sovereign Lord?
[1062.74 → 1067.30] Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?
[1068.28 → 1073.54] But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin
[1073.54 → 1078.34] and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live?
[1078.94 → 1081.78] None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered.
[1082.38 → 1084.96] Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of.
[1085.44 → 1087.96] Because of the sins they have committed, they will die.
[1089.10 → 1091.96] Yet you say, the way of the Lord is not just.
[1092.74 → 1095.72] Here, you Israelites, is my way unjust?
[1096.00 → 1098.28] Is not your ways that are unjust?
[1098.84 → 1102.50] If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin,
[1102.98 → 1104.02] they will die for it.
[1104.06 → 1106.62] Because of the sin they committed, they will die.
[1107.30 → 1110.44] But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed
[1110.44 → 1114.68] and does what is just and right, they will save their lives.
[1115.38 → 1120.12] Because they consider all the offences they have committed and turned away from them,
[1120.12 → 1122.56] that person will surely live.
[1123.10 → 1124.22] They will not die.
[1124.22 → 1128.34] Yet the Israelites say, the way of the Lord is not just.
[1128.66 → 1131.24] Are my ways unjust, people of Israel?
[1131.62 → 1133.36] Is it not your ways that are unjust?
[1134.10 → 1138.38] Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways,
[1138.56 → 1139.84] declares the sovereign Lord.
[1140.50 → 1141.04] Repent.
[1141.68 → 1143.28] Turn away from all your offences.
[1143.28 → 1145.88] Then sin will not be your downfall.
[1146.26 → 1148.76] Rid yourselves of all the offences you have committed.
[1149.66 → 1153.54] And you will get a new heart and a new spirit.
[1154.46 → 1156.26] Why will you die, people of Israel?
[1156.44 → 1160.38] For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the sovereign Lord.
[1161.22 → 1163.04] Repent and live.
[1163.84 → 1164.82] This is the word of the Lord.
[1164.82 → 1170.78] You know, in one of the ways that we live the Christian life,
[1171.72 → 1174.74] really, really one of the ways that you know that you've met the God of the Bible,
[1175.06 → 1176.52] and actually that you are a Christian,
[1177.36 → 1182.96] is that you increasingly recognize that the central problem that you and I have
[1182.96 → 1187.20] is the sin that resides in every human heart.
[1188.00 → 1188.22] Right?
[1188.26 → 1193.60] It's the sin that stands between us and the God who made us and who loves us.
[1193.60 → 1199.30] But yet, also, as a Christian, you know that the way to fight against this sin
[1199.30 → 1201.90] is to bring it to God in confession.
[1202.94 → 1203.16] Right?
[1203.24 → 1206.58] Where you unearth that sin that's hidden in us,
[1206.62 → 1207.84] you bring it before God,
[1207.94 → 1211.26] you shine the light of his holiness upon it,
[1211.30 → 1214.28] and it is obliterated in the grace and mercy of our Lord.
[1214.90 → 1217.42] So I want to invite you now to do just that,
[1217.50 → 1221.30] to pray with me as I lead us in a prayer of confession.
[1221.92 → 1222.84] Let's pray together.
[1223.60 → 1227.46] Holy and merciful God,
[1228.10 → 1232.30] we confess to you, Lord, that we are sinful.
[1232.30 → 1236.40] And when we honestly search our hearts,
[1236.48 → 1238.94] we are confronted with the many moments,
[1239.20 → 1240.56] the many situations,
[1241.08 → 1245.56] where we know that we have done what is evil in your sight.
[1247.00 → 1250.14] Even still, your love remains.
[1250.14 → 1254.44] And so, in humility and in brokenness and in true repentance,
[1254.44 → 1257.50] we ask you, Lord, to forgive us and heal us.
[1258.06 → 1261.18] Buy us back from our slavery to our sinful nature
[1261.18 → 1263.58] in our own selfish ways.
[1264.18 → 1266.08] Crown us again with your righteousness.
[1266.74 → 1270.98] And, Lord, would you satisfy the real thirst of our souls
[1270.98 → 1272.78] that only you can satisfy.
[1272.78 → 1275.92] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1276.28 → 1276.56] Amen.
[1278.02 → 1282.92] And so, friends, the Bible tells us that our God is two things.
[1283.58 → 1285.58] Well, the Bible says a lot of things about God,
[1285.68 → 1291.54] but two things are that he is both slow and rich.
[1292.72 → 1295.42] God is both slow and rich.
[1295.56 → 1296.10] How so?
[1296.64 → 1297.60] In what ways?
[1297.60 → 1299.10] Well, let's hear what the Bible says.
[1302.80 → 1306.62] The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
[1307.68 → 1309.46] slow to anger,
[1310.26 → 1312.02] and rich in love.
[1313.10 → 1315.90] People of God, you will weep no more.
[1316.60 → 1319.12] How gracious he will be when you cry for help.
[1319.40 → 1322.00] As soon as he hears, he will answer you.
[1323.34 → 1325.54] He who did not spare his own son,
[1325.60 → 1326.88] but gave him up for us all,
[1326.88 → 1329.48] how will he not also, along with him,
[1330.10 → 1332.10] graciously give us all things?
[1332.88 → 1333.68] Thanks be to God.
[1334.18 → 1336.78] Let's all stand and let's sing of his grace
[1336.78 → 1339.82] together with some more songs of praise to him.
[1339.82 → 1343.14] song slings and singing by the Lord,
[1343.24 → 1343.66] will be the Lord and the Lord.
[1344.98 → 1347.38] Were Achoo about birds alone.
[1347.44 → 1349.74] as B'll become by the Lord.
[1350.10 → 1351.42] and into your son,
[1351.60 → 1364.52] while my bill is known
[1364.52 → 1365.18] and when you come along with others will become that we shall.
[1365.18 → 1370.70] We will feast in the house of snow.
[1371.26 → 1376.54] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1376.54 → 1382.36] We will stay together.
[1382.82 → 1388.90] We will feast and weep no more.
[1388.90 → 1397.78] We will not be burned by the fire.
[1397.78 → 1402.78] He is the Lord our God.
[1403.78 → 1409.78] We have not been shamed by the fire.
[1410.20 → 1416.42] A path protected that we're done.
[1416.42 → 1423.36] We will feast in the house of snow.
[1423.62 → 1429.08] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1429.50 → 1434.90] As unbreakable we will stay together.
[1435.56 → 1441.38] We will feast and weep no more.
[1441.38 → 1450.32] In the dark of night before the dawn.
[1450.32 → 1456.20] My soul be not afraid.
[1456.20 → 1462.20] But this morning of the dawn.
[1462.20 → 1468.82] O God, O Jacob, be my son.
[1471.08 → 1476.82] We will feast in the house of snow.
[1476.82 → 1482.64] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1482.64 → 1485.20] He is done with thirst.
[1485.50 → 1488.38] We will stay together.
[1488.76 → 1494.98] We will feast and weep no more.
[1494.98 → 1496.92] We will feast and weep no more.
[1496.92 → 1498.56] We will feast in the house of snow.
[1498.56 → 1502.76] Every vow we've broken and betrayed.
[1502.76 → 1509.90] You are the faithful one.
[1509.90 → 1516.34] Been from the garden to the grave.
[1516.34 → 1524.40] I must together bring shalom.
[1525.18 → 1530.72] We will feast in the house of town.
[1531.06 → 1536.40] We will sing with our hearts restored.
[1536.80 → 1542.36] We will sing together.
[1542.36 → 1548.76] We will feast and we go home.
[1549.14 → 1555.40] We will feast and we go home.
[1572.36 → 1585.04] Speak, O Lord, as we come to you, to receive the fruit of the Holy Word.
[1585.54 → 1590.64] Take your truth, plant it deep in us.
[1590.98 → 1596.78] Shape and fashion us in your likeness.
[1596.78 → 1603.02] Let the light of light be seen today.
[1603.36 → 1609.98] In our acts of love, in our deeds of faith.
[1610.44 → 1621.56] Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory.
[1621.56 → 1642.78] Teach us, Lord, full obedience, holy reverence, true humility.
[1642.78 → 1655.26] Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your glory.
[1655.26 → 1661.62] As our feet to rise, cross our eyes to see.
[1661.96 → 1667.26] Your majestic love and authority.
[1669.06 → 1674.06] Words of power that can never fail.
[1674.42 → 1680.56] Let the truth prevail over unbelief.
[1680.56 → 1695.24] Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds.
[1695.24 → 1702.24] Help us grasp the voice of your plans for us.
[1702.74 → 1707.72] Truths and change from the dawn of time.
[1707.72 → 1713.72] That will echo down through eternity.
[1714.52 → 1719.96] And by grace we'll stand on your promises.
[1719.96 → 1726.72] That by faith we'll walk this up with us.
[1727.72 → 1732.96] Speak, O Lord, till your church is built.
[1732.96 → 1739.44] And the earth is built with your glory.
[1756.56 → 1759.08] The children are dismissed to go to their classes now.
[1759.08 → 1760.08] Thank you.
[1772.48 → 1778.02] So while they're going, I'll share with you that yesterday, a couple of our elders and me,
[1778.12 → 1780.62] we went to what's called the BC Leaders Conference.
[1780.62 → 1783.08] So this was held at New Life in Abbotsford.
[1783.34 → 1789.20] And what it is just a group of churches in our classes who, I guess we've done this for three years now,
[1789.32 → 1795.32] where in the fall we have a one-day conference to help train and equip office bearers in our church.
[1795.32 → 1805.80] And so we heard a wonderful keynote session by Tim Sheridan, who is the director of church planting with Resonate Global Mission.
[1806.34 → 1810.68] And also some breakout sessions where we took up different topics of ministry.
[1810.98 → 1813.02] And so I think we all learned a lot.
[1813.74 → 1817.04] And so just to let you know that this kind of things happen as well.
[1817.04 → 1822.18] So we are in Romans chapter 8.
[1822.38 → 1826.88] So let's open our Bibles now to the book of Romans in the New Testament.
[1827.96 → 1835.34] And we are kind of looking through chapter 8 this fall, going passage by passage.
[1837.74 → 1842.94] And today we are in verses 10 to 13.
[1842.94 → 1847.22] Romans chapter 8, verses 10 to 13.
[1847.32 → 1848.72] Now what is this passage all about?
[1849.94 → 1853.24] This is about some amazing things.
[1853.78 → 1855.30] It's about God in us.
[1855.62 → 1856.94] It's about Christ in us.
[1857.10 → 1858.58] The Holy Spirit in us.
[1859.22 → 1860.80] It is about life and death.
[1861.56 → 1863.94] And, you know, resurrection, immortality.
[1864.80 → 1866.10] It's about sin and holiness.
[1866.80 → 1869.94] And everything in these verses is just marked by grandeur.
[1869.94 → 1873.38] Really, all of chapter 8, essentially.
[1874.42 → 1877.86] But let's go ahead and see what the Lord says to us, his people.
[1878.22 → 1879.18] And we'll begin reading.
[1879.24 → 1880.80] Actually, we'll begin reading in verse 9.
[1881.52 → 1883.64] So let's hear God's word.
[1884.72 → 1890.74] You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh, but are in the realm of the Spirit,
[1891.18 → 1893.58] if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
[1893.58 → 1900.94] And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
[1902.14 → 1911.26] But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin,
[1912.32 → 1915.82] the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
[1915.82 → 1921.60] And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you,
[1922.56 → 1928.62] he who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
[1928.62 → 1931.74] because of his Spirit who lives in you.
[1932.80 → 1937.04] Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation,
[1937.90 → 1941.12] but it is not to the flesh to live according to it.
[1941.76 → 1944.68] For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[1944.68 → 1951.86] But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
[1953.22 → 1954.50] This is the word of the Lord.
[1955.24 → 1956.32] Thanks be to God.
[1957.32 → 1958.46] Well, let's pray.
[1958.78 → 1962.50] Let's ask for God's blessing upon his word for us today.
[1962.78 → 1963.54] Let's pray together.
[1964.84 → 1968.82] Heavenly Father, we give you great thanks for your word.
[1968.96 → 1970.18] It's a word that is true.
[1970.18 → 1975.16] It's a word that tells us of your great love for us.
[1976.02 → 1978.40] It's a word, Lord, that we embrace by faith.
[1979.46 → 1983.38] And would you now pour life into us through your word?
[1983.54 → 1988.12] Would you remove any unnecessary barriers or distractions?
[1989.28 → 1992.74] Lord, would you open our hearts to hear what you have to say to us
[1992.74 → 1996.62] so that we might then live for your glory, the glory of your great name?
[1997.00 → 1998.70] We ask this through Christ our Lord.
[1999.22 → 1999.50] Amen.
[2002.38 → 2007.70] Well, my son Abram has really developed an interest in gardening.
[2007.86 → 2008.70] I didn't give him warning.
[2009.20 → 2009.60] Sorry.
[2009.60 → 2015.28] I always remember Gary Rosema said whenever he used his kids for illustration,
[2015.44 → 2016.84] he would give them a townie or something.
[2017.16 → 2018.96] So I'll owe you.
[2020.24 → 2028.06] So Abram, I pay after though, he's developed his interest in gardening over the last couple of years.
[2028.26 → 2033.72] And so the house we moved into about two years ago, it has a pretty big garden plot in our backyard.
[2033.72 → 2037.96] And I know actually a lot of you are expert gardeners.
[2038.94 → 2041.92] But my family and I, we don't really know what we're doing.
[2042.90 → 2049.42] So Christy, my wife, she looked online, and she learned that to prepare the garden for the spring,
[2049.60 → 2051.40] because we're like, oh, in the spring we'll plant some stuff.
[2051.96 → 2054.62] But she said, well, actually to prepare for the spring,
[2054.76 → 2058.42] there's actually a lot of work you have to do now in the fall.
[2059.58 → 2059.80] Right?
[2059.88 → 2063.14] And so you actually have to constantly be working in the garden.
[2063.14 → 2065.66] It's not just like a seasonal thing, which is what I always thought.
[2066.92 → 2069.94] And so not only do you have to dig out the weeds,
[2070.48 → 2074.62] but then you have to plant a cover crop, I guess it's called,
[2074.76 → 2077.76] that will then grow and will keep the weeds from taking over.
[2079.66 → 2085.24] And so now when it comes to weeding, as you all know, you expert weeders here,
[2085.88 → 2091.32] you can't just like break off the little green bits that you see coming up out of the soil.
[2091.32 → 2093.20] Right? That doesn't do any good.
[2093.32 → 2097.26] It kind of looks like you did some work, but no, actually you haven't.
[2097.92 → 2099.90] You've got to actually get to the root.
[2100.60 → 2103.20] And you have to dig the roots out.
[2103.64 → 2106.92] Otherwise, they will just continue to grow and to spread,
[2107.02 → 2108.38] and the garden becomes full of weeds.
[2108.38 → 2114.36] So over the last couple of weeks, we've been in this battle.
[2116.28 → 2120.14] And I don't know if we're doing it right, but we dug out the whole section,
[2120.30 → 2125.68] like a shovel height in depth, turned it all over, dug out the weeds,
[2126.12 → 2128.88] kept the soil aside, and then we did it again.
[2128.88 → 2134.96] Two shovelfuls down, pulled it all out, rooted out all the roots,
[2136.30 → 2142.82] and in a mission to destroy every last bit of root that was in this garden plot.
[2144.90 → 2148.40] And then, so Christi and Abram, after that, we put all the soil back,
[2148.46 → 2153.50] then they planted some vegetables, some flowers that can then now grow in its place.
[2153.50 → 2159.96] So the reason I'm talking about this is that when we come to these verses in Romans 8,
[2161.26 → 2166.36] we kind of see that our lives are kind of like a garden plot.
[2167.10 → 2167.34] Right?
[2167.38 → 2172.54] You've got the weeds of sin deep down in the soil of your heart.
[2173.14 → 2178.92] And you've got also these beautiful flowers, these vegetables growing as well.
[2180.18 → 2181.94] And we're to fight.
[2181.94 → 2186.60] And the vegetables are fighting for space in the garden of our hearts.
[2187.12 → 2187.22] Right?
[2187.26 → 2188.88] The good things are fighting for space.
[2189.60 → 2190.04] Holiness.
[2190.64 → 2195.68] And you've got to try and make sure then that more good things are growing and coming out
[2195.68 → 2198.04] and less bad things, fewer weeds.
[2198.80 → 2201.02] And that really is an image of the Christian life.
[2201.90 → 2202.14] Right?
[2202.20 → 2204.46] We're trying to get rid of the sin.
[2205.10 → 2210.10] And it's a battle that involves not just like pulling out the little stuff that you see
[2210.10 → 2214.70] in hiding it, getting rid of it, but actually it involves digging down deep
[2214.70 → 2220.90] and getting at the roots of sin that is so deep in our hearts.
[2222.60 → 2224.74] But again, we're not just pulling out the weeds.
[2224.86 → 2229.28] We're actually then, you know, we're not just negative Christians where we like don't do certain things
[2229.28 → 2231.72] and we fight sin, but we're positive Christians.
[2231.84 → 2236.78] Like we want to grow in beauty and goodness and holiness and righteousness.
[2236.98 → 2240.42] And we're planting these fruits of the Spirit also in our lives.
[2241.50 → 2245.90] And so let's keep that image in mind as we look at these verses.
[2246.42 → 2251.18] And really, I think there are kind of just two main points that I want us to look at today.
[2251.18 → 2257.66] And the first is we're going to look at what are these tools that we need for spiritual gardening.
[2258.66 → 2261.82] And then secondly, what is the work of spiritual gardening?
[2261.98 → 2263.88] Okay, so the tools and the work.
[2264.54 → 2272.38] And what we see here is that God actually equips us with everything we need to live the Christian life.
[2273.02 → 2276.80] Like to live this life of weeding out sin by the help of the Holy Spirit
[2276.80 → 2280.86] and then actually growing the good things of the Spirit in our lives.
[2281.18 → 2287.66] So let's look together at our first point, the tools for spiritual gardening.
[2288.34 → 2292.88] Okay, so the thing is before we get to the actual work that we're called to do,
[2293.06 → 2295.70] Paul is in a number of different ways in this passage
[2295.70 → 2302.68] assuring Christians that we actually have what it takes to practice
[2302.68 → 2306.22] and to engage in this work that he calls us to.
[2307.16 → 2310.24] So look first with me at verse 10 as we begin.
[2311.18 → 2312.52] What does Paul say?
[2313.44 → 2316.78] But if Christ is in you.
[2317.94 → 2320.02] But if Christ is in you.
[2320.34 → 2322.20] So let's pause there for a moment.
[2324.00 → 2328.38] So Paul is not suggesting that we need to do something.
[2328.66 → 2331.66] That we need to do anything to have the tools,
[2331.72 → 2333.48] to get the tools for spiritual gardening.
[2333.48 → 2335.20] Like when we did this gardening project,
[2335.40 → 2339.54] I had to run a Rona and I bought a new shovel because we didn't really have one.
[2339.72 → 2341.90] And we bought some new soil to put down.
[2341.96 → 2343.68] All this stuff that I had to go get.
[2344.36 → 2347.36] But actually what Paul is saying is that you have it all.
[2347.90 → 2349.10] You don't have to run to the store.
[2349.42 → 2350.76] You have everything you need.
[2351.42 → 2352.58] And what he says is,
[2352.92 → 2354.14] Christ is in you.
[2354.14 → 2361.80] And he's stating something that is very important to understand as Christians.
[2363.18 → 2365.14] So let me ask you this.
[2365.92 → 2368.64] If I were to ask you, and here I am, I'm asking you.
[2370.06 → 2372.24] Asking you as someone who is a Christian,
[2373.46 → 2375.26] who lives in your heart?
[2377.04 → 2378.52] Who lives in your heart?
[2378.52 → 2379.76] What would you say?
[2383.00 → 2384.08] Okay, well it is there.
[2384.20 → 2384.32] Fine.
[2384.54 → 2386.62] I was thinking you might say the Holy Spirit.
[2387.52 → 2387.88] Right?
[2388.16 → 2388.96] Who lives in your heart?
[2389.04 → 2391.14] Well, I often think, nine times out of ten,
[2391.38 → 2393.82] we actually say the Holy Spirit lives in my heart.
[2394.40 → 2395.60] So let's pretend you said that.
[2397.60 → 2398.28] You're right.
[2399.50 → 2400.18] And Christ.
[2400.30 → 2401.06] We'll get to that in a second.
[2401.16 → 2401.26] Yeah.
[2401.46 → 2403.12] So the Holy Spirit lives in your heart.
[2403.18 → 2403.34] Right?
[2403.38 → 2404.40] And that is absolutely true.
[2404.76 → 2407.50] Because actually we're told in Romans chapter 8
[2407.50 → 2409.30] that the Spirit lives in us.
[2409.42 → 2411.18] And Romans chapter 8 is all about
[2411.18 → 2413.94] what the Spirit is doing in the life of the believer.
[2415.20 → 2417.06] But we're also told here
[2417.06 → 2420.56] not just that the Holy Spirit lives in us,
[2420.92 → 2424.58] but that Christ dwells in our hearts.
[2424.66 → 2426.08] That Christ is in us.
[2426.82 → 2427.06] Right?
[2427.16 → 2428.56] Because of what Paul says here.
[2429.42 → 2433.18] And Paul will also say in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 17,
[2433.18 → 2435.58] one of the most amazing verses ever,
[2436.14 → 2436.72] he says,
[2436.72 → 2440.46] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[2442.04 → 2442.30] Okay?
[2442.38 → 2444.54] So it's not just the Holy Spirit,
[2444.72 → 2446.32] but its Christ is in us.
[2447.00 → 2447.92] And so what does that mean?
[2447.96 → 2449.34] It means that Jesus now,
[2450.02 → 2455.10] he stops merely being a historical figure way back when,
[2455.84 → 2459.30] or some unattainable ideal way up high,
[2460.34 → 2463.42] and he's no longer just a Saviour who is outside of us,
[2463.42 → 2464.28] but he is actually,
[2464.34 → 2465.92] he becomes a Saviour within us.
[2466.58 → 2466.82] Right?
[2466.88 → 2469.76] He becomes a Saviour that is deeper within us
[2469.76 → 2472.42] than our most stubborn sin.
[2473.42 → 2475.70] When we think sometimes that sin is really deep,
[2475.80 → 2477.00] Christ is deeper still.
[2479.30 → 2480.16] The, you know,
[2480.24 → 2481.72] the risen Christ dwells in our hearts.
[2482.36 → 2483.98] But that is not all.
[2483.98 → 2487.74] Because if the Holy Spirit dwells in your hearts,
[2487.86 → 2489.98] and if Christ dwells in your hearts,
[2490.64 → 2494.88] would it also not make sense that the Father dwells in our hearts?
[2495.66 → 2497.94] And the answer, of course, is yes.
[2498.58 → 2498.76] Right?
[2498.86 → 2501.04] And so we see in verse 11 in our passage,
[2501.62 → 2502.14] where it says,
[2502.14 → 2510.12] And Paul is speaking here of God the Father.
[2510.40 → 2510.50] Right?
[2510.56 → 2513.12] It's the Father who raised Christ from the dead
[2513.12 → 2514.28] by the power of the Spirit.
[2515.40 → 2518.02] And if you want further evidence for this,
[2518.86 → 2521.96] we just need to look at 1 John 4, verse 12.
[2523.02 → 2524.08] This is what John says,
[2524.08 → 2525.74] No one has ever seen God,
[2525.86 → 2527.34] but if we love one another,
[2528.18 → 2530.08] God lives in us.
[2530.80 → 2533.22] And his love is made complete in us.
[2534.00 → 2536.74] Now, how do we know that the reference here is to God the Father?
[2537.38 → 2540.52] Well, it's because John tells us in verse 9
[2540.52 → 2544.00] that God sent his only Son into the world.
[2544.96 → 2547.06] And then that same God lives in us.
[2548.62 → 2550.62] So, he's speaking of the Father.
[2551.24 → 2552.54] And so what this means is,
[2552.54 → 2553.72] God the Father,
[2554.40 → 2556.02] and Christ,
[2556.40 → 2557.34] and the Holy Spirit,
[2557.42 → 2558.64] the triune God,
[2558.98 → 2560.00] lives in you.
[2561.42 → 2565.64] My friends, that is a mind-boggling thing to think about.
[2566.02 → 2566.18] Right?
[2566.20 → 2569.50] That God has put his sacred presence into you.
[2569.82 → 2569.96] Right?
[2570.04 → 2572.42] And so, you are lifted,
[2572.58 → 2574.14] that you are brought into,
[2574.28 → 2575.36] and you're surrounded by,
[2575.44 → 2576.76] and you're embraced by,
[2576.76 → 2579.08] God's non-condemning,
[2580.10 → 2581.32] holy presence.
[2582.54 → 2584.74] The triune God living in you.
[2585.08 → 2586.30] And then, so that means you can say,
[2586.46 → 2587.54] I belong to God,
[2588.28 → 2589.56] because God belongs to me.
[2591.16 → 2592.18] And that means, friends,
[2592.24 → 2594.60] that you could not be more complete.
[2595.12 → 2597.06] You could not be more equipped
[2597.06 → 2599.36] to live the Christian life.
[2599.36 → 2603.26] You have the triune God living in you.
[2604.76 → 2605.82] And that's why Paul,
[2605.90 → 2607.10] at the end of 2 Corinthians,
[2607.24 → 2608.24] he gives this benediction
[2608.24 → 2609.76] that we often use at the end
[2609.76 → 2611.10] of our worship service,
[2611.36 → 2611.90] where he says,
[2612.02 → 2613.74] may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2613.90 → 2615.54] the love of God,
[2615.66 → 2617.14] and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[2617.14 → 2618.04] be with you.
[2618.10 → 2619.80] And he says that because he is.
[2619.94 → 2621.14] He is with you.
[2621.14 → 2626.10] Now, there's a minister in Scotland
[2626.10 → 2629.08] in the 1600s.
[2629.18 → 2630.82] He actually died very young
[2630.82 → 2632.94] at the age of 25 of tuberculosis.
[2633.80 → 2635.08] But he wrote a little book.
[2635.16 → 2635.56] It's called
[2635.56 → 2639.08] The Life of God in the Soul of Man.
[2639.82 → 2641.84] The Life of God in the Soul of Man
[2641.84 → 2643.86] that has become a classic
[2643.86 → 2644.76] of the Christian life.
[2644.76 → 2647.92] Why did he write this?
[2648.40 → 2650.30] He wrote it because, he says,
[2651.08 → 2652.74] it is so easy
[2652.74 → 2655.04] to misunderstand true Christianity.
[2656.24 → 2657.28] This is why he wrote it.
[2657.30 → 2658.12] He wrote it to a friend
[2658.12 → 2658.98] who was really struggling
[2658.98 → 2660.02] with the Christian life.
[2660.50 → 2661.54] And he wrote this little booklet
[2661.54 → 2662.70] because it is so easy
[2662.70 → 2664.20] to misunderstand true Christianity.
[2664.64 → 2665.80] So this is what he wrote.
[2665.86 → 2667.04] His name was Henry Schools.
[2667.86 → 2668.72] He wrote this.
[2670.08 → 2671.52] I cannot speak of religion
[2671.52 → 2673.16] without lamenting
[2673.16 → 2675.64] that of the many who claim it,
[2675.86 → 2676.94] few understand it.
[2677.66 → 2679.62] Some people locate religion
[2679.62 → 2680.70] in the intellect.
[2682.16 → 2684.50] Others see it as a model behaviour.
[2685.42 → 2686.66] Still, others find it
[2686.66 → 2688.90] in ecstatic experience.
[2690.26 → 2692.32] All of these can look religious,
[2692.72 → 2693.90] but people do bad things
[2693.90 → 2695.14] in the name of such religion.
[2696.08 → 2698.04] True religion is deeper.
[2698.80 → 2701.04] It is Christ formed within us.
[2701.14 → 2702.98] It is the life of God.
[2703.72 → 2705.20] In the soul of man.
[2707.12 → 2707.82] Okay, so, you know,
[2707.86 → 2708.38] so often,
[2708.70 → 2710.14] especially maybe us Reformed types,
[2710.22 → 2710.44] we say,
[2710.54 → 2711.28] what is true religion?
[2711.64 → 2712.92] It's Reformed doctrine.
[2713.04 → 2713.58] It's our intellect,
[2713.68 → 2714.66] what we affirm and believe
[2714.66 → 2715.18] and confess,
[2715.24 → 2715.96] and that's good and true.
[2716.52 → 2717.44] Sometimes we think,
[2717.54 → 2718.62] well, it is good behaviour.
[2718.78 → 2719.58] We need to make sure
[2719.58 → 2721.32] we live in an upstanding way.
[2721.38 → 2722.24] That is true religion.
[2722.62 → 2724.66] Or it's experience
[2724.66 → 2725.68] and worship
[2725.68 → 2727.18] and heartfelt emotion.
[2727.80 → 2728.98] That's true religion.
[2729.72 → 2730.22] But no,
[2730.98 → 2731.94] true religion
[2731.94 → 2734.36] is God in us.
[2734.52 → 2735.42] The life of God
[2735.42 → 2736.58] in the soul of man,
[2736.70 → 2737.40] men and women
[2737.40 → 2738.00] and children.
[2740.34 → 2741.48] That's true Christianity.
[2741.48 → 2742.38] And Christianity
[2742.38 → 2744.44] is not then how we attain God
[2744.44 → 2745.84] through our intellect,
[2745.98 → 2746.74] through our emotions,
[2747.06 → 2747.76] through our behaviour,
[2747.76 → 2749.54] but rather it is how God
[2749.54 → 2751.56] comes to live within us.
[2752.56 → 2753.70] Okay, I think I've made
[2753.70 → 2754.60] that point enough.
[2755.24 → 2756.94] So now as we continue on,
[2757.16 → 2758.82] what does this triune God
[2758.82 → 2760.48] do in our lives?
[2760.52 → 2761.06] What does he do?
[2761.52 → 2763.02] So let's look at verse 10.
[2764.12 → 2765.04] He says,
[2765.04 → 2765.98] Paul continues,
[2766.34 → 2767.82] but if Christ is in you,
[2768.52 → 2769.66] then even though your body
[2769.66 → 2770.54] is subject to death
[2770.54 → 2771.40] because of sin,
[2772.28 → 2773.68] the Spirit gives life
[2773.68 → 2775.46] because of righteousness.
[2775.84 → 2777.22] So as we look at this verse,
[2777.84 → 2778.00] right,
[2778.08 → 2779.26] kind of the keywords
[2779.26 → 2779.86] that pop out
[2779.86 → 2781.34] are death and life.
[2781.44 → 2782.00] Very simply,
[2782.14 → 2783.10] death and life, right?
[2783.58 → 2784.58] Our bodies,
[2784.74 → 2785.24] it's saying,
[2785.56 → 2787.18] are certainly going to die
[2787.18 → 2788.46] because of the consequences
[2788.46 → 2788.94] of sin.
[2789.80 → 2790.38] Paul said,
[2790.74 → 2791.72] sin entered the world
[2791.72 → 2792.38] through one man
[2792.38 → 2793.52] and death through sin.
[2793.52 → 2794.48] Romans 8, 12,
[2794.72 → 2795.72] or 5, 12.
[2796.96 → 2798.08] Death through sin.
[2798.38 → 2799.34] And so we're all carrying
[2799.34 → 2800.46] this fatal disease
[2800.46 → 2801.72] of sin within us.
[2802.98 → 2804.62] But here's the good news,
[2804.74 → 2806.18] which is the Spirit gives life
[2806.18 → 2807.04] because of righteousness.
[2807.54 → 2808.68] What does that mean?
[2808.84 → 2810.00] Well, there are different ways
[2810.00 → 2810.98] we might consider it,
[2811.04 → 2812.30] but here's what I think it means.
[2812.86 → 2814.02] It means that the life
[2814.02 → 2815.40] that is truly life,
[2815.54 → 2818.94] full, rich, lasting life,
[2819.28 → 2820.54] the Spirit gives it to us
[2820.54 → 2822.78] because of the righteousness
[2822.78 → 2824.70] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2825.82 → 2825.96] Right?
[2826.00 → 2826.32] And so,
[2826.50 → 2827.36] what that means is
[2827.36 → 2828.80] no one is more alive
[2828.80 → 2830.56] than a sinner
[2830.56 → 2832.46] who has been made alive
[2832.46 → 2833.22] and set free
[2833.22 → 2834.24] by the finished work
[2834.24 → 2835.32] of Christ on the cross.
[2836.34 → 2836.48] Right?
[2836.56 → 2836.92] And so,
[2837.10 → 2838.96] so Christ crucified,
[2839.36 → 2840.94] he sends our sins
[2840.94 → 2842.50] far, far away,
[2842.60 → 2843.38] never to return.
[2843.92 → 2844.12] Right?
[2844.14 → 2844.86] We are forgiven
[2844.86 → 2846.26] because of Christ's righteousness.
[2846.60 → 2847.60] And then the Holy Spirit
[2847.60 → 2849.20] then brings to us
[2849.20 → 2850.28] new life.
[2850.28 → 2852.16] So Christ crucified,
[2852.32 → 2853.72] he sends our sins far away,
[2854.10 → 2854.88] the Holy Spirit
[2854.88 → 2856.12] then gives us new life.
[2857.02 → 2858.02] So that's verse 10.
[2858.44 → 2860.36] Now, as we come to verse 11,
[2861.04 → 2863.08] we see that Paul
[2863.08 → 2864.98] is really trying to explain
[2864.98 → 2866.66] just how precious
[2866.66 → 2868.76] this indwelling life
[2868.76 → 2869.68] of the Spirit is.
[2870.38 → 2870.58] Okay?
[2870.68 → 2871.74] In verse 11,
[2872.02 → 2872.26] you know,
[2872.34 → 2875.02] there's so much here,
[2875.20 → 2876.22] I just want to touch
[2876.22 → 2876.74] on it briefly.
[2876.92 → 2877.22] I'm thinking,
[2877.32 → 2877.56] you know what,
[2877.56 → 2878.26] next Easter.
[2878.76 → 2879.04] This is,
[2879.14 → 2879.38] we're gonna,
[2879.68 → 2880.86] we're gonna look at this one
[2880.86 → 2881.14] for only,
[2881.26 → 2881.66] so we'll see.
[2882.38 → 2882.68] But,
[2882.96 → 2884.52] this is what verse 11 says.
[2884.84 → 2886.06] If the Spirit of him
[2886.06 → 2887.62] who raised Jesus from the dead
[2887.62 → 2888.44] is living in you,
[2889.14 → 2890.72] he who raised Christ
[2890.72 → 2891.48] from the dead
[2891.48 → 2893.06] will also give life
[2893.06 → 2894.12] to your mortal bodies
[2894.12 → 2895.24] because of his Spirit
[2895.24 → 2896.26] who lives in you.
[2897.94 → 2899.74] But what I want to think about now
[2899.74 → 2902.40] is the idea here
[2902.40 → 2903.44] of the union
[2903.44 → 2904.98] that we have
[2904.98 → 2905.66] with our Redeemer.
[2906.36 → 2906.46] Right?
[2906.46 → 2907.62] He's talking about
[2907.62 → 2908.66] the solidarity
[2908.66 → 2909.94] of Christ
[2909.94 → 2910.70] with his people.
[2911.84 → 2912.02] So,
[2912.62 → 2913.20] so think of,
[2913.32 → 2914.16] think about it this way.
[2915.28 → 2916.84] When Christ died,
[2917.52 → 2919.02] I died with him.
[2919.76 → 2920.78] And when Christ
[2920.78 → 2921.84] was buried in the tomb,
[2921.94 → 2922.72] I was buried
[2922.72 → 2923.82] in the tomb with him.
[2924.20 → 2925.48] And when he was raised
[2925.48 → 2925.96] from the dead,
[2926.06 → 2928.16] I was raised with him.
[2929.02 → 2930.22] And so what is true
[2930.22 → 2930.96] of Jesus
[2930.96 → 2932.92] will ultimately
[2932.92 → 2934.18] be always true
[2934.18 → 2935.06] of us.
[2935.06 → 2937.06] And so we have to ask,
[2937.12 → 2937.42] well then,
[2937.66 → 2938.78] did Jesus die?
[2939.88 → 2940.28] Yes.
[2941.10 → 2941.92] So guess what?
[2942.44 → 2943.48] You will also die.
[2944.76 → 2945.92] Was he raised?
[2946.06 → 2946.44] Yes.
[2946.68 → 2948.02] You will be raised.
[2948.98 → 2950.20] Is he seated
[2950.20 → 2952.22] in the heavenly places?
[2952.22 → 2953.40] He is.
[2953.40 → 2953.42] He is,
[2953.48 → 2954.74] and you will always
[2954.74 → 2956.02] live before the face
[2956.02 → 2956.50] of God
[2956.50 → 2958.18] in eternity.
[2959.58 → 2960.48] And so we can say this,
[2960.54 → 2961.26] that there's nothing
[2961.26 → 2963.24] that Christ possesses,
[2963.38 → 2964.14] there is nothing
[2964.14 → 2965.38] that he enjoys
[2965.38 → 2967.28] that he will not share
[2967.28 → 2967.70] with you.
[2968.68 → 2968.88] Okay?
[2968.92 → 2969.72] That he will not share
[2969.72 → 2970.02] with you.
[2970.10 → 2971.42] You have everything
[2971.42 → 2972.98] because Christ,
[2973.52 → 2973.84] you know,
[2973.94 → 2974.78] in him.
[2975.30 → 2976.20] Because your life
[2976.20 → 2977.12] is just so intimately
[2977.12 → 2978.12] bound up with his,
[2978.34 → 2979.36] now and forever.
[2979.36 → 2982.64] And so as we look
[2982.64 → 2983.20] at these verses,
[2983.34 → 2983.46] friends,
[2983.52 → 2984.24] this is everything
[2984.24 → 2984.96] we need to live
[2984.96 → 2985.62] the Christian life.
[2985.70 → 2986.66] We actually have
[2986.66 → 2988.12] the life of the triune God,
[2988.20 → 2989.02] Father, Son,
[2989.02 → 2989.60] and Holy Spirit
[2989.60 → 2990.74] living in us.
[2991.20 → 2992.20] Christ has died
[2992.20 → 2993.76] to cast our sins away.
[2994.04 → 2994.60] The Holy Spirit
[2994.60 → 2995.58] has given us life.
[2995.70 → 2997.06] We are united to Christ
[2997.06 → 2998.00] in his life,
[2998.08 → 2998.20] death,
[2998.22 → 2998.74] and resurrection
[2998.74 → 3000.18] and ascension.
[3001.14 → 3002.08] What more
[3002.08 → 3003.84] could we possibly need?
[3004.38 → 3004.98] There is nothing.
[3005.40 → 3006.18] God has thought
[3006.18 → 3006.68] of everything.
[3007.80 → 3008.52] We lack nothing.
[3008.52 → 3009.12] Okay,
[3009.28 → 3010.26] that leads us then
[3010.26 → 3011.62] to just our second point
[3011.62 → 3012.12] this morning.
[3012.94 → 3014.02] What is this work then
[3014.02 → 3014.90] of spiritual gardening?
[3016.10 → 3017.54] We have everything we need,
[3017.64 → 3018.68] so what do we then
[3018.68 → 3019.22] need to do?
[3020.06 → 3020.90] And Paul begins
[3020.90 → 3021.42] to describe
[3021.42 → 3022.44] what this looks like
[3022.44 → 3023.62] in verse 12.
[3024.54 → 3026.02] This is what Paul says.
[3026.72 → 3026.98] Therefore,
[3027.46 → 3028.28] brothers and sisters,
[3028.64 → 3029.84] we have an obligation,
[3030.72 → 3032.22] but it is not to the flesh
[3032.22 → 3034.16] to live according to it.
[3035.36 → 3035.58] Okay,
[3035.64 → 3035.96] so again,
[3036.06 → 3036.44] Paul,
[3036.44 → 3037.16] as he did,
[3037.24 → 3037.96] like in the verses
[3037.96 → 3038.72] we saw last week,
[3038.76 → 3039.84] he's talking about the flesh.
[3040.58 → 3041.78] And what is the flesh?
[3042.10 → 3042.24] Well,
[3042.26 → 3042.98] it's just a biblical
[3042.98 → 3044.76] kind of shorthand
[3044.76 → 3047.68] for our sinful nature.
[3048.44 → 3048.78] Right?
[3048.84 → 3050.28] It is the damage to sin,
[3050.36 → 3051.48] it's the influence of sin
[3051.48 → 3051.98] in our lives
[3051.98 → 3053.94] that is kind of naturally
[3053.94 → 3055.44] just going against God.
[3056.10 → 3056.82] That's the flesh.
[3057.86 → 3059.78] And what verse 12 says
[3059.78 → 3061.32] is that you don't owe
[3061.32 → 3062.72] the flesh a thing.
[3064.18 → 3065.54] You have to realize that.
[3065.54 → 3066.64] I have to realize this.
[3067.42 → 3069.54] We do not owe the flesh
[3069.54 → 3070.94] a darn thing.
[3072.46 → 3073.16] So,
[3073.28 → 3074.46] there is never a moment
[3074.46 → 3076.62] when we need to say,
[3077.08 → 3077.64] oh well,
[3077.86 → 3078.98] this flesh,
[3079.08 → 3079.20] you know,
[3079.26 → 3080.26] I better feed
[3080.26 → 3081.64] my poor sinful nature.
[3082.44 → 3082.66] Right?
[3082.66 → 3083.78] I better just give it
[3083.78 → 3084.70] what it wants.
[3085.56 → 3085.96] No.
[3087.02 → 3088.22] We need to say
[3088.22 → 3089.14] to our sinful nature,
[3089.28 → 3090.32] I owe you nothing.
[3091.42 → 3091.74] Right?
[3091.74 → 3092.42] You're not getting
[3092.42 → 3094.38] a thing from me.
[3094.50 → 3095.26] I refuse
[3095.26 → 3096.98] to give you anything.
[3097.08 → 3098.00] I owe you nothing.
[3098.76 → 3099.58] Because honestly,
[3099.84 → 3101.16] when you think about it,
[3101.26 → 3102.84] what has your sinful nature
[3102.84 → 3104.10] ever done for you?
[3105.40 → 3107.82] What has it ever given you?
[3108.40 → 3108.62] Right?
[3108.72 → 3110.06] Except sadness
[3110.06 → 3111.52] and pain
[3111.52 → 3112.98] and embarrassment
[3112.98 → 3113.94] and disappointment
[3113.94 → 3114.94] and damage
[3114.94 → 3116.44] for starters.
[3118.58 → 3119.02] Okay,
[3119.02 → 3119.30] now,
[3119.54 → 3120.50] we do though
[3120.50 → 3121.44] have an obligation
[3121.44 → 3122.26] but it is not
[3122.26 → 3123.00] to the flesh.
[3123.80 → 3124.76] It is to God.
[3125.96 → 3127.32] Because Romans chapter 8,
[3127.38 → 3128.28] it tells us everything
[3128.28 → 3129.94] that God has done for us.
[3130.70 → 3131.38] Like all that
[3131.38 → 3132.14] he has actually
[3132.14 → 3132.72] given us
[3132.72 → 3133.58] by his grace.
[3134.32 → 3135.02] And then the gospel,
[3135.18 → 3136.38] it opens our eyes
[3136.38 → 3137.42] to help us to think
[3137.42 → 3138.08] like this,
[3138.14 → 3138.54] to say,
[3139.18 → 3139.78] my sin
[3139.78 → 3140.74] and my self-centred
[3140.74 → 3141.68] way of life
[3141.68 → 3142.96] which comes so naturally
[3142.96 → 3143.46] to me,
[3143.62 → 3144.74] I renounce it.
[3145.00 → 3146.10] I reject it.
[3146.44 → 3147.60] I don't want it anymore.
[3147.60 → 3149.18] I now have
[3149.18 → 3150.76] a new loyalty
[3150.76 → 3152.06] because God
[3152.06 → 3153.08] has given me everything.
[3153.92 → 3154.06] Right?
[3154.12 → 3155.54] And now I am so rich
[3155.54 → 3157.06] and I owe
[3157.06 → 3158.10] everything to him.
[3158.72 → 3159.86] He has given me
[3159.86 → 3160.60] so much.
[3160.98 → 3162.12] My life belongs
[3162.12 → 3162.42] to him.
[3162.50 → 3163.34] I owe everything
[3163.34 → 3164.20] to him.
[3165.26 → 3166.10] That is
[3166.10 → 3167.24] actually the work
[3167.24 → 3167.92] of the Holy Spirit
[3167.92 → 3168.52] in our lives.
[3169.86 → 3170.42] But
[3170.42 → 3171.88] it's not easy.
[3172.66 → 3172.90] Right?
[3172.98 → 3173.50] It's not easy.
[3173.94 → 3175.10] It's not automatic.
[3175.10 → 3178.00] So what do we have to do?
[3178.06 → 3178.92] How do we cooperate
[3178.92 → 3180.34] with the Spirit
[3180.34 → 3180.94] in our lives?
[3181.08 → 3182.08] And so now let's look
[3182.08 → 3183.20] finally at verse 13
[3183.20 → 3185.56] where Paul says,
[3186.38 → 3187.14] for if you live
[3187.14 → 3188.14] according to the flesh
[3188.14 → 3188.82] you will die
[3188.82 → 3190.80] but if by the Spirit
[3190.80 → 3192.20] you put to death
[3192.20 → 3193.02] the misdeeds
[3193.02 → 3193.76] of the body
[3193.76 → 3195.60] you will live.
[3196.74 → 3197.76] So now we see here
[3197.76 → 3198.50] this paradox.
[3200.02 → 3200.92] There's this paradox
[3200.92 → 3201.36] going on.
[3201.42 → 3202.34] He's talking about life
[3202.34 → 3203.90] versus death.
[3203.90 → 3205.32] And he says
[3205.32 → 3206.64] if you keep on living
[3206.64 → 3207.92] according to the flesh
[3207.92 → 3210.28] according to its desires
[3210.28 → 3211.98] you will die.
[3212.78 → 3212.90] Right?
[3213.00 → 3213.90] Living in this way
[3213.90 → 3215.26] gratifying the sinful nature
[3215.26 → 3216.78] you will die.
[3216.92 → 3217.84] Sin leads to death.
[3218.78 → 3219.94] But if you die
[3219.94 → 3221.14] to your sinful nature
[3221.14 → 3222.44] if you take up
[3222.44 → 3223.10] your cross
[3223.10 → 3224.92] and deny yourself
[3224.92 → 3226.40] and surrender yourself
[3226.40 → 3226.90] right?
[3227.54 → 3228.54] If you put to death
[3228.54 → 3229.20] by the Spirit
[3229.20 → 3229.88] the misdeeds
[3229.88 → 3230.42] of the body
[3230.42 → 3231.64] then you will live.
[3231.64 → 3234.26] in dying to sin
[3234.26 → 3235.26] you have life.
[3235.32 → 3235.98] It's a paradox.
[3237.90 → 3238.80] So what are
[3238.80 → 3239.46] the misdeeds
[3239.46 → 3240.04] of the body?
[3241.00 → 3241.52] Well
[3241.52 → 3242.12] it's
[3242.12 → 3243.24] it's envy
[3243.24 → 3245.46] it's pride
[3245.46 → 3247.10] it's murder
[3247.10 → 3248.38] it's hate
[3248.38 → 3249.58] it's greed
[3249.58 → 3250.72] it's stealing
[3250.72 → 3251.74] and idolatry
[3251.74 → 3252.94] and sexual immorality
[3252.94 → 3254.58] and unkindness
[3254.58 → 3255.62] anything
[3255.62 → 3256.42] that is against
[3256.42 → 3257.04] God's law
[3257.04 → 3258.46] to love him
[3258.46 → 3259.50] with our heart
[3259.50 → 3259.88] soul mind
[3259.88 → 3260.30] strength
[3260.30 → 3261.20] to love our neighbours
[3261.20 → 3261.86] as ourselves
[3261.86 → 3262.98] ourselves
[3262.98 → 3264.30] right?
[3264.38 → 3265.10] And anything
[3265.10 → 3266.10] against his law
[3266.10 → 3266.90] of love
[3266.90 → 3267.52] for God
[3267.52 → 3268.04] and neighbour
[3268.04 → 3270.12] whether in our hearts
[3270.12 → 3271.62] or in our words
[3271.62 → 3273.20] or in our actions
[3273.20 → 3274.44] right?
[3274.50 → 3275.36] It's the weeds
[3275.36 → 3276.26] of sin
[3276.26 → 3277.84] that grow up
[3277.84 → 3278.74] and kind of
[3278.74 → 3279.88] show themselves
[3279.88 → 3280.86] in our lives.
[3281.66 → 3282.34] These are the
[3282.34 → 3282.82] misdeeds
[3282.82 → 3283.32] of the body.
[3284.92 → 3285.52] And so
[3285.52 → 3286.24] Paul is
[3286.24 → 3287.24] though convinced
[3287.24 → 3288.18] that as a Christian
[3288.18 → 3289.18] that we will not
[3289.18 → 3289.88] live in that way.
[3291.26 → 3291.50] He said
[3291.50 → 3292.06] as a Christian
[3292.06 → 3292.54] you're not going to
[3292.54 → 3293.42] live in that way
[3293.42 → 3294.36] and why is that?
[3294.76 → 3296.00] Because you will put
[3296.00 → 3297.02] to death
[3297.02 → 3297.64] the misdeeds
[3297.64 → 3298.10] of the body.
[3299.10 → 3300.40] You will kill
[3300.40 → 3301.08] your sin.
[3302.32 → 3303.20] This is what
[3303.20 → 3304.46] Christians used to call
[3304.46 → 3305.26] the mortification
[3305.26 → 3305.88] of sin.
[3306.00 → 3306.78] Has anybody ever
[3306.78 → 3307.74] heard that phrase?
[3308.38 → 3309.28] The mortification
[3309.28 → 3309.92] of sin.
[3310.64 → 3311.90] And how do you
[3311.90 → 3312.38] mortify?
[3312.50 → 3312.88] We don't say
[3312.88 → 3313.30] I'm going to
[3313.30 → 3313.96] mortify something.
[3314.62 → 3315.14] To mortify
[3315.14 → 3316.14] means to kill it.
[3316.58 → 3316.76] Right?
[3318.36 → 3318.86] And so Paul
[3318.86 → 3319.38] is using
[3319.38 → 3319.98] some pretty
[3319.98 → 3320.66] strong language
[3320.66 → 3321.06] here.
[3321.56 → 3322.28] He's not just
[3322.28 → 3322.80] saying oh
[3322.80 → 3323.36] just kind of
[3323.36 → 3324.28] stop sinning
[3324.28 → 3325.28] or maybe
[3325.28 → 3326.76] ignore your sin
[3326.76 → 3327.32] or tell it
[3327.32 → 3327.88] to go away.
[3328.08 → 3328.66] He's saying
[3328.66 → 3329.64] kill it.
[3330.60 → 3331.44] It's very
[3331.44 → 3332.06] strong language.
[3332.14 → 3332.48] It's like
[3332.48 → 3333.64] digging weeds
[3333.64 → 3334.38] out of a garden.
[3334.80 → 3335.34] You don't just
[3335.34 → 3336.98] ignore those weeds.
[3337.50 → 3338.64] You pull them
[3338.64 → 3339.92] out by the root.
[3340.70 → 3341.92] You annihilate
[3341.92 → 3342.30] them.
[3343.82 → 3344.26] And sometimes
[3344.26 → 3344.80] it actually
[3344.80 → 3345.56] takes some
[3345.56 → 3346.10] fighting
[3346.10 → 3347.46] to put to
[3347.46 → 3347.96] death the
[3347.96 → 3348.40] deeds of the
[3348.40 → 3348.72] flesh.
[3350.96 → 3351.20] You know
[3351.20 → 3351.94] there's a hymn
[3351.94 → 3352.66] we sing
[3352.66 → 3353.84] sometimes in our
[3353.84 → 3354.08] church.
[3354.16 → 3354.58] It's one of my
[3354.58 → 3355.28] favourite hymns.
[3356.00 → 3356.58] Be thou my
[3356.58 → 3356.94] vision.
[3357.42 → 3357.56] Right?
[3357.62 → 3358.02] And I'm sure
[3358.02 → 3358.70] it's a favourite
[3358.70 → 3359.50] to many of you
[3359.50 → 3359.92] as well.
[3360.84 → 3361.50] And one of the
[3361.50 → 3362.24] verses says
[3362.24 → 3362.68] this.
[3364.22 → 3365.18] Be thou
[3365.18 → 3366.16] my battle
[3366.16 → 3366.74] shield
[3366.74 → 3368.46] sword for
[3368.46 → 3369.04] my fight.
[3372.14 → 3372.84] It's this
[3372.84 → 3374.44] idea of the
[3374.44 → 3375.24] Christian life
[3375.24 → 3376.18] that it's
[3376.18 → 3376.76] actually a
[3376.76 → 3377.04] fight.
[3377.80 → 3377.96] You know
[3377.96 → 3378.52] sometimes we
[3378.52 → 3378.88] think oh the
[3378.88 → 3379.42] Christian life
[3379.42 → 3379.80] it's about
[3379.80 → 3380.14] kind of
[3380.14 → 3380.94] solitude and
[3380.94 → 3382.04] quietness and
[3382.04 → 3382.66] you know
[3382.66 → 3383.56] warm feelings.
[3385.56 → 3386.46] Yes but
[3386.46 → 3387.48] it's also a
[3387.48 → 3387.88] fight.
[3387.88 → 3389.06] It's a battle
[3389.06 → 3390.54] against sin.
[3391.82 → 3392.04] Right?
[3392.04 → 3392.52] Because you
[3392.52 → 3393.78] see if sin
[3393.78 → 3395.48] left unmortified
[3395.48 → 3397.94] weeds left
[3397.94 → 3398.90] unmortified what
[3398.90 → 3399.18] do they do?
[3399.24 → 3400.02] They ravage the
[3400.02 → 3400.28] garden.
[3400.44 → 3401.26] They take it
[3401.26 → 3401.68] over.
[3402.12 → 3402.84] Sin left
[3402.84 → 3403.70] unmortified what
[3403.70 → 3404.10] does it do in
[3404.10 → 3404.56] your heart?
[3404.84 → 3405.84] It takes over.
[3407.02 → 3407.30] Right?
[3407.46 → 3408.30] When sin is
[3408.30 → 3409.50] given into when
[3409.50 → 3410.28] we think on
[3410.28 → 3410.86] that sin and
[3410.86 → 3411.44] then we like
[3411.44 → 3412.18] practice that
[3412.18 → 3413.24] sin it starts
[3413.24 → 3413.68] to gain a
[3413.68 → 3414.26] kind of control
[3414.26 → 3414.84] over us.
[3415.28 → 3416.30] It starts to
[3416.30 → 3417.52] then grow and
[3417.52 → 3419.54] grow and as a
[3419.54 → 3420.46] result we give
[3420.46 → 3421.56] more energy to
[3421.56 → 3422.02] it, and we give
[3422.02 → 3422.98] more time to
[3422.98 → 3424.04] it, and we give
[3424.04 → 3424.90] more thought to
[3424.90 → 3427.42] doing it and
[3427.42 → 3428.16] because of that
[3428.16 → 3429.24] we give less and
[3429.24 → 3430.72] less time and
[3430.72 → 3431.48] energy and thought
[3431.48 → 3432.02] to Christ and
[3432.02 → 3432.48] his kingdom.
[3433.30 → 3434.56] It just sins can
[3434.56 → 3435.32] just kind of
[3435.32 → 3436.58] squeeze the life
[3436.58 → 3437.60] out of us.
[3439.38 → 3440.82] But when we put
[3440.82 → 3441.68] sin to death the
[3441.68 → 3442.24] opposite thing
[3442.24 → 3442.62] happens.
[3442.62 → 3442.88] Right?
[3443.74 → 3444.64] There becomes
[3444.64 → 3445.70] then more room
[3445.70 → 3447.16] for the grace of
[3447.16 → 3447.76] God to grow.
[3447.88 → 3448.94] For the love of
[3448.94 → 3450.30] God and the
[3450.30 → 3450.88] freedom and the
[3450.88 → 3451.34] joy of the Holy
[3451.34 → 3452.04] Spirit to take
[3452.04 → 3452.88] root and to
[3452.88 → 3453.68] grow these
[3453.68 → 3454.42] beautiful flowers
[3454.42 → 3455.74] and fruits of
[3455.74 → 3456.50] the Christian
[3456.50 → 3457.02] life and that's
[3457.02 → 3457.40] the point.
[3458.42 → 3459.30] That's what we're
[3459.30 → 3459.78] doing here.
[3460.72 → 3461.66] Now by way of
[3461.66 → 3462.62] application you
[3462.62 → 3463.04] know I want to
[3463.04 → 3463.62] share a few
[3463.62 → 3465.60] ideas about how
[3465.60 → 3466.38] we can then
[3466.38 → 3467.00] fight against
[3467.00 → 3468.60] sin with the
[3468.60 → 3469.22] Spirit's help.
[3470.36 → 3471.20] And because the
[3471.20 → 3471.78] thing is we have
[3471.78 → 3472.46] to realize like we
[3472.46 → 3473.28] don't do this on
[3473.28 → 3474.16] our own remember?
[3474.72 → 3475.28] Like you're not
[3475.28 → 3476.08] just left to
[3476.08 → 3476.76] yourself and God
[3476.76 → 3477.90] is like you know
[3477.90 → 3479.02] you better do this
[3479.02 → 3479.76] and we're like
[3479.76 → 3480.52] oh it's hard.
[3481.14 → 3481.44] No.
[3482.12 → 3482.92] You have all of
[3482.92 → 3483.56] these resources
[3483.56 → 3484.02] remember?
[3484.44 → 3484.92] The Spirit.
[3485.14 → 3486.26] Paul says if by
[3486.26 → 3487.20] the Spirit you
[3487.20 → 3487.88] put to death the
[3487.88 → 3488.36] misdeeds of the
[3488.36 → 3488.62] body.
[3489.30 → 3490.88] The Spirit is
[3490.88 → 3491.46] helping us.
[3491.52 → 3491.80] Do it.
[3492.42 → 3493.32] So what are some
[3493.32 → 3495.00] of the graces of
[3495.00 → 3495.46] the Spirit?
[3495.58 → 3496.14] The graces of
[3496.14 → 3497.44] God to help us?
[3498.56 → 3499.04] I just want to
[3499.04 → 3499.86] mention three things
[3499.86 → 3500.52] briefly as we
[3500.52 → 3500.86] close.
[3501.48 → 3502.32] The first thing
[3502.32 → 3502.90] is this.
[3505.06 → 3505.54] Sensitivity
[3505.54 → 3506.24] towards sin.
[3506.70 → 3507.18] That's one of the
[3507.18 → 3507.88] things God gives
[3507.88 → 3508.16] us.
[3508.78 → 3508.90] Right?
[3508.96 → 3509.58] So when God
[3509.58 → 3510.92] gives you the
[3510.92 → 3511.62] Holy Spirit in
[3511.62 → 3513.44] your life part of
[3513.44 → 3514.32] what the Holy Spirit
[3514.32 → 3516.68] does in your life is
[3516.68 → 3517.82] he awakens you to
[3517.82 → 3518.86] the reality of sin.
[3519.24 → 3520.10] Like before you have
[3520.10 → 3521.06] the Holy Spirit you
[3521.06 → 3521.70] know you kind of live
[3521.70 → 3522.58] in sin and whatever
[3522.58 → 3523.44] maybe it's fun or
[3523.44 → 3524.72] it's you know doesn't
[3524.72 → 3525.46] bother you as much.
[3525.68 → 3526.18] But when you have
[3526.18 → 3526.76] the Holy Spirit
[3526.76 → 3528.02] suddenly you're
[3528.02 → 3529.00] sensitive to sin.
[3530.60 → 3530.86] Okay?
[3530.96 → 3531.96] And so he awakens
[3531.96 → 3532.76] you to this reality
[3532.76 → 3533.28] of sin.
[3533.74 → 3534.68] He makes you sensitive
[3534.68 → 3535.70] to anything that is
[3535.70 → 3535.86] sin.
[3535.94 → 3536.58] Anything that is
[3536.58 → 3537.96] against his word.
[3539.52 → 3540.14] And so then what
[3540.14 → 3540.98] you need to do as
[3540.98 → 3541.74] a Christian is to
[3541.74 → 3543.42] embrace those pricks
[3543.42 → 3544.86] of the conscience
[3544.86 → 3546.76] that happens.
[3547.46 → 3547.70] Right?
[3547.74 → 3548.40] And then you use
[3548.40 → 3549.66] that as a warning
[3549.66 → 3551.48] to yourself to turn
[3551.48 → 3552.84] away from what
[3552.84 → 3553.72] you're doing or
[3553.72 → 3555.26] thinking or whatever.
[3555.66 → 3556.00] The sin.
[3556.76 → 3557.50] Because eventually
[3557.50 → 3558.52] if you ignore those
[3558.52 → 3559.36] pricks of conscience
[3559.36 → 3560.92] and just carry on in
[3560.92 → 3561.52] that sin
[3561.52 → 3562.98] right you become
[3562.98 → 3564.30] desensitized.
[3564.48 → 3564.60] Right?
[3564.60 → 3565.40] And we've all I think
[3565.40 → 3566.30] experienced this.
[3567.36 → 3568.40] And it made me think
[3568.40 → 3569.24] of when I had my
[3569.24 → 3570.32] wisdom tooth pulled.
[3572.32 → 3573.72] It was really
[3573.72 → 3575.02] this one embedded
[3575.02 → 3575.90] so deeply
[3575.90 → 3576.94] like in my gums
[3576.94 → 3578.12] that the dentist
[3578.12 → 3579.30] had to really like
[3579.30 → 3582.02] I don't know
[3582.02 → 3582.62] mortify it
[3582.62 → 3583.22] or whatever.
[3583.58 → 3583.82] Okay?
[3583.86 → 3584.32] He had to like
[3584.32 → 3585.40] cut the gum.
[3585.60 → 3586.24] He had to then
[3586.24 → 3586.86] take this thing
[3586.86 → 3587.64] and like whack it
[3587.64 → 3588.46] and split the tooth
[3588.46 → 3588.88] apart.
[3589.44 → 3590.18] Very violent.
[3590.38 → 3590.66] Okay?
[3590.82 → 3591.50] And then he had to
[3591.50 → 3592.52] pull out the pieces.
[3592.70 → 3593.24] That's the only way
[3593.24 → 3593.82] to get it out.
[3594.76 → 3595.62] Now obviously
[3595.62 → 3596.82] what did he do first?
[3598.20 → 3599.14] He froze it.
[3599.44 → 3599.96] Or as we say
[3599.96 → 3600.36] in the U.S.
[3600.36 → 3601.08] he numbed it.
[3602.12 → 3602.78] It's one of these
[3602.78 → 3603.44] things you have to learn.
[3604.02 → 3605.40] So he froze it
[3605.40 → 3606.64] and so the first
[3606.64 → 3607.60] prick of that needle
[3607.60 → 3609.54] it hurts.
[3609.76 → 3610.24] It's like ow!
[3610.54 → 3611.14] He knows his needle
[3611.14 → 3611.68] sticking you know.
[3612.12 → 3612.92] It hurts but
[3612.92 → 3613.88] but then after that
[3613.88 → 3614.34] what happens?
[3615.88 → 3616.30] You just numb.
[3616.40 → 3617.28] You don't feel anything.
[3618.28 → 3619.14] And that's what sin
[3619.14 → 3619.60] does right?
[3619.68 → 3620.42] It gives us that
[3620.42 → 3621.32] prick initially
[3621.32 → 3622.00] when you have
[3622.00 → 3622.86] a sensitive conscious
[3622.86 → 3624.90] ah that's sin
[3624.90 → 3626.24] you know you're sinning
[3626.24 → 3627.52] but then if it
[3627.52 → 3628.32] happens again
[3628.32 → 3629.72] when you don't
[3629.72 → 3630.70] respond to it
[3630.70 → 3631.52] you start to not
[3631.52 → 3632.22] feel anything
[3632.22 → 3633.60] because you've
[3633.60 → 3634.30] lost sensitivity
[3634.30 → 3634.86] and so you're just
[3634.86 → 3635.24] kind of like
[3635.24 → 3635.82] oh sin maybe
[3635.82 → 3636.54] is not a big deal.
[3637.42 → 3638.22] That's what sin does
[3638.22 → 3639.04] it numbs you.
[3640.48 → 3641.70] So what we can do
[3641.70 → 3642.52] is just be sensitive
[3642.52 → 3642.94] to that
[3642.94 → 3643.58] when the Holy Spirit
[3643.58 → 3644.66] is at work in your heart
[3644.66 → 3645.88] and when he gives you
[3645.88 → 3646.52] that prick
[3646.52 → 3648.00] say ah pay attention.
[3648.00 → 3648.90] Okay?
[3649.06 → 3650.62] Maybe God is telling me
[3650.62 → 3651.86] you know I don't
[3651.86 → 3652.84] I shouldn't do this
[3652.84 → 3653.44] I shouldn't give in
[3653.44 → 3654.04] to the sin
[3654.04 → 3655.62] and so the Spirit
[3655.62 → 3656.24] makes you aware
[3656.24 → 3656.96] of sin in your life
[3656.96 → 3657.56] that's what the Spirit
[3657.56 → 3657.92] does.
[3658.56 → 3659.28] Now here's a second
[3659.28 → 3660.22] thing to think about
[3660.22 → 3663.34] it's actually to bring
[3663.34 → 3664.12] to mind
[3664.12 → 3665.10] the evils of sin
[3665.10 → 3667.56] because we are so good
[3667.56 → 3668.68] at convincing ourselves
[3668.68 → 3669.46] that sin
[3669.46 → 3670.68] is not a big deal.
[3671.22 → 3672.08] Other people sin
[3672.08 → 3672.74] big deal.
[3673.04 → 3673.44] Our sin
[3673.44 → 3674.26] it's fine.
[3674.94 → 3675.08] Right?
[3675.32 → 3676.40] We make excuses
[3676.40 → 3678.54] especially for our own sin.
[3679.86 → 3680.82] So what we need to do
[3680.82 → 3682.08] is a reality check
[3682.08 → 3683.56] and we get that
[3683.56 → 3684.18] by realizing
[3684.18 → 3685.52] that God hates sin.
[3686.70 → 3687.18] Right?
[3687.24 → 3687.88] We have to realize
[3687.88 → 3690.74] God actually hates sin.
[3691.24 → 3692.58] He is against it.
[3693.32 → 3694.80] With everything that he is
[3694.80 → 3696.16] the maker of heaven and earth
[3696.16 → 3697.12] you know he took
[3697.12 → 3698.46] of that dwelling within us
[3698.46 → 3700.20] as a sign of his love
[3700.20 → 3701.14] a sign of his grace
[3701.14 → 3701.90] and his affection
[3701.90 → 3703.76] and when you sin
[3703.76 → 3705.16] or continue in sin
[3705.16 → 3706.92] and purposely sin
[3706.92 → 3708.56] you grieve God.
[3709.14 → 3710.58] You grieve the Holy Spirit.
[3712.24 → 3712.54] And so
[3712.54 → 3714.08] we need to just realize
[3714.08 → 3716.18] the hatefulness of sin
[3716.18 → 3717.20] so that we are then
[3717.20 → 3717.70] motivated
[3717.70 → 3718.80] to actually
[3718.80 → 3719.90] go after it.
[3719.96 → 3721.20] I hate those weeds
[3721.20 → 3722.76] in my garden.
[3722.90 → 3723.54] If you're a gardener
[3723.54 → 3724.34] you hate weeds.
[3724.98 → 3725.28] I don't know
[3725.28 → 3725.76] maybe there's like
[3725.76 → 3726.18] a new movement
[3726.18 → 3727.02] of like loving weeds.
[3727.10 → 3727.48] I don't know
[3727.48 → 3729.44] but probably you hate weeds.
[3730.16 → 3730.30] Okay?
[3730.38 → 3731.02] It chokes out
[3731.02 → 3731.68] all the good stuff
[3731.68 → 3732.76] so you have to
[3732.76 → 3733.98] kill it.
[3733.98 → 3734.66] Okay?
[3735.30 → 3736.16] Don't even make excuses
[3736.16 → 3736.82] for those weeds.
[3737.34 → 3737.62] Anyway.
[3739.14 → 3739.58] Finally
[3739.58 → 3741.56] another way
[3741.56 → 3742.72] we can put sin to death
[3742.72 → 3743.88] and this is
[3743.88 → 3744.52] what we talked about
[3744.52 → 3745.06] a little bit earlier
[3745.06 → 3745.60] in the service
[3745.60 → 3746.98] is to confess our sin.
[3748.10 → 3748.26] Okay?
[3748.74 → 3750.46] Sin loves to kind of
[3750.46 → 3751.52] grow and fester
[3751.52 → 3752.78] in the dark.
[3753.62 → 3753.96] Weeds
[3753.96 → 3755.58] love to just spread
[3755.58 → 3756.40] and those roots
[3756.40 → 3757.36] just grow
[3757.36 → 3758.52] in the dark
[3758.52 → 3759.24] and so we have to
[3759.24 → 3760.18] dig them up.
[3760.24 → 3760.84] We have to turn
[3760.84 → 3761.76] over the soil
[3761.76 → 3763.38] shine light on it
[3763.38 → 3764.32] and then we can
[3764.32 → 3765.54] put them to death
[3765.54 → 3767.30] and when you confess
[3767.30 → 3768.48] that you have sinned
[3768.48 → 3769.74] how do you
[3769.74 → 3770.82] then put those
[3770.82 → 3771.52] things to death?
[3772.10 → 3772.66] You say
[3772.66 → 3773.44] I have the blood
[3773.44 → 3774.12] of Christ
[3774.12 → 3775.46] stamped
[3775.46 → 3776.98] all over that sin
[3776.98 → 3777.56] and that blood
[3777.56 → 3778.14] of Christ
[3778.14 → 3779.00] is going to then
[3779.00 → 3780.14] annihilate that sin
[3780.14 → 3781.82] because you've been
[3781.82 → 3782.18] forgiven.
[3782.88 → 3783.54] That sin has
[3783.54 → 3784.24] been forgiven
[3784.24 → 3785.34] so it doesn't
[3785.34 → 3786.42] belong in you.
[3786.54 → 3787.40] You pull it out
[3787.40 → 3788.78] you give it to God
[3788.78 → 3789.76] at the foot of the cross
[3789.76 → 3791.14] because it has
[3791.14 → 3791.86] already been forgiven.
[3791.86 → 3792.60] It is gone.
[3793.00 → 3793.70] Don't let it dwell
[3793.70 → 3794.00] there.
[3795.10 → 3796.20] So we go to God
[3796.20 → 3796.86] and we say
[3796.86 → 3797.74] the things that are
[3797.74 → 3799.02] really in our hearts
[3799.02 → 3799.54] that means
[3799.54 → 3800.78] confessing real sins
[3800.78 → 3801.42] not just being like
[3801.42 → 3801.94] oh well
[3801.94 → 3802.90] you know I'm not
[3802.90 → 3803.80] as perfect as I could
[3803.80 → 3804.80] be but God
[3804.80 → 3805.18] is gracious.
[3805.70 → 3805.88] No.
[3807.78 → 3809.06] The specific sins
[3809.06 → 3809.78] that you struggle
[3809.78 → 3810.24] with you
[3810.24 → 3811.68] give those to God
[3811.68 → 3812.92] and then that is
[3812.92 → 3813.66] how you can
[3813.66 → 3814.40] put them to death.
[3816.34 → 3817.02] And then you know
[3817.02 → 3817.20] what?
[3817.32 → 3818.48] God loves to answer
[3818.48 → 3819.22] this prayer.
[3819.50 → 3820.08] It's a prayer
[3820.08 → 3821.32] that comes from
[3821.32 → 3822.44] Psalm 139
[3822.44 → 3823.44] when we pray this.
[3824.18 → 3824.94] When we say to God
[3824.94 → 3825.86] search me God
[3825.86 → 3827.60] know my heart
[3827.60 → 3828.28] test me
[3828.28 → 3829.24] know my anxious
[3829.24 → 3829.78] thoughts
[3829.78 → 3831.46] see if there is
[3831.46 → 3832.68] any offensive way
[3832.68 → 3833.20] in me
[3833.20 → 3834.16] and then lead me
[3834.16 → 3834.64] in the way of
[3834.64 → 3835.10] everlasting.
[3835.80 → 3836.68] God answers that
[3836.68 → 3836.94] prayer
[3836.94 → 3838.32] when we pray that
[3838.32 → 3838.66] to him.
[3840.12 → 3840.88] And really
[3840.88 → 3841.70] it's a lifelong
[3841.70 → 3842.82] invitation
[3842.82 → 3844.46] to become more
[3844.46 → 3845.26] and more like
[3845.26 → 3846.02] Jesus Christ.
[3846.54 → 3847.56] But it's a process
[3847.56 → 3848.60] it's slow
[3848.60 → 3849.84] it's really
[3849.84 → 3850.64] hard work
[3850.64 → 3853.38] and so
[3853.38 → 3854.54] final thing
[3854.54 → 3855.04] I want to share
[3855.04 → 3856.24] in C.S. Lewis's
[3856.24 → 3857.22] Chronicles of Narnia
[3857.22 → 3858.22] you know there's
[3858.22 → 3859.80] this character
[3859.80 → 3860.96] who is thoroughly
[3860.96 → 3862.80] distasteful
[3862.80 → 3863.48] despicable
[3863.48 → 3864.38] kind of guy
[3864.38 → 3865.64] named Eustacy
[3865.64 → 3867.92] but Eustacy
[3867.92 → 3868.72] has a turning
[3868.72 → 3869.66] point in the story.
[3870.86 → 3871.52] He's still kind
[3871.52 → 3872.16] of annoying
[3872.16 → 3873.16] but he has a
[3873.16 → 3873.64] turning point
[3873.64 → 3874.22] and this is what
[3874.22 → 3875.10] Lewis says about
[3875.10 → 3876.42] Eustacy
[3876.42 → 3877.56] this is what he says
[3877.56 → 3879.54] Lewis writes
[3879.54 → 3880.90] it would be nice
[3880.90 → 3882.12] and fairly
[3882.12 → 3883.10] nearly true
[3883.10 → 3884.42] to say
[3884.42 → 3885.64] that from that
[3885.64 → 3886.50] time forth
[3886.50 → 3887.26] Eustacy was
[3887.26 → 3888.44] a different boy
[3888.44 → 3889.90] to be strictly
[3889.90 → 3890.48] accurate
[3890.48 → 3892.16] he began
[3892.16 → 3893.14] to be
[3893.14 → 3893.96] a different boy
[3893.96 → 3896.18] he had relapses
[3896.18 → 3897.60] there were still
[3897.60 → 3898.36] many days
[3898.36 → 3899.14] when he could
[3899.14 → 3900.18] be tiresome
[3900.18 → 3902.02] but most of those
[3902.02 → 3902.70] I will not
[3902.70 → 3903.40] speak of
[3903.40 → 3905.48] the cure
[3905.48 → 3906.58] had
[3906.58 → 3907.32] begun
[3907.32 → 3910.10] so friends
[3910.10 → 3910.42] when
[3910.42 → 3911.90] we open
[3911.90 → 3912.86] our hearts
[3912.86 → 3913.52] to Christ
[3913.52 → 3914.48] the cure
[3914.48 → 3915.06] has begun
[3915.06 → 3916.66] okay
[3916.66 → 3918.20] sin is forgiven
[3918.20 → 3919.14] is being rooted
[3919.14 → 3919.78] out of us
[3919.78 → 3920.42] you have this
[3920.42 → 3920.92] new life
[3920.92 → 3921.50] of the spirit
[3921.50 → 3922.22] he gives you
[3922.22 → 3923.12] everything you need
[3923.12 → 3923.84] to dig up
[3923.84 → 3924.36] that sin
[3924.36 → 3925.48] to pull it out
[3925.48 → 3926.18] to pull it
[3926.18 → 3927.00] to death
[3927.00 → 3928.12] to fight against it
[3928.12 → 3929.70] then to grow
[3929.70 → 3930.56] in the fruit
[3930.56 → 3931.06] of the spirit
[3931.06 → 3932.40] so let me ask you
[3932.40 → 3932.90] this morning
[3932.90 → 3935.92] is there a sin
[3935.92 → 3936.86] in your life
[3936.86 → 3937.60] that you are
[3937.60 → 3938.66] making peace with
[3938.66 → 3942.74] is there an area
[3942.74 → 3943.64] of your life
[3943.64 → 3944.36] where you need
[3944.36 → 3944.90] to live
[3944.90 → 3945.64] differently
[3945.64 → 3948.70] today is the day
[3948.70 → 3950.80] to put it to death
[3950.80 → 3953.10] with the spirit's help
[3953.10 → 3954.42] so that the life
[3954.42 → 3954.84] of Christ
[3954.84 → 3955.36] can grow
[3955.36 → 3956.12] in you
[3956.12 → 3957.04] okay
[3957.04 → 3957.62] so let me pray
[3957.62 → 3958.54] that God would help us
[3958.54 → 3963.02] O Lord
[3963.02 → 3963.58] our God
[3963.58 → 3964.08] we pray
[3964.08 → 3964.62] that
[3964.62 → 3966.60] that we will
[3966.60 → 3967.18] take
[3967.18 → 3968.36] seriously
[3968.36 → 3969.02] our sin
[3969.02 → 3970.24] and live
[3970.24 → 3971.20] for your glory
[3971.20 → 3973.06] because we are alive
[3973.06 → 3973.68] in the spirit
[3973.68 → 3974.80] by the resurrection
[3974.80 → 3976.00] power of Christ
[3976.00 → 3977.50] who dwells in us
[3977.50 → 3978.54] Lord
[3978.54 → 3978.98] we know
[3978.98 → 3979.78] that we are forgiven
[3979.78 → 3980.82] because of what Christ
[3980.82 → 3981.72] has done for us
[3981.72 → 3982.64] and yet we know
[3982.64 → 3983.74] the battle remains
[3983.74 → 3985.32] and O Lord
[3985.32 → 3986.12] we want to fight
[3986.12 → 3986.68] this battle
[3986.68 → 3987.84] and not simply
[3987.84 → 3988.64] because you say
[3988.64 → 3989.38] we must
[3989.38 → 3990.56] though that would
[3990.56 → 3991.06] be enough
[3991.06 → 3993.16] but because we know
[3993.16 → 3993.80] that in fighting
[3993.80 → 3994.26] the battle
[3994.26 → 3995.24] the fruit of the spirit
[3995.24 → 3996.68] can grow more
[3996.68 → 3997.68] bountifully
[3997.68 → 3998.74] and beautifully
[3998.74 → 4000.08] in our lives
[4000.08 → 4000.92] for your glory
[4000.92 → 4001.78] and our joy
[4001.78 → 4003.46] help us to do so
[4003.46 → 4003.70] Lord

[4004.56 → 4005.48] Amen
[4005.48 → 4009.36] okay

[4011.06 → 4012.12] our song of response
[4012.12 → 4012.58] this morning

[4121.32 → 4123.52] empty praise.

[4149.26 → 4151.26] my victory
[4151.26 → 4152.96] love.
[4153.58 → 4155.26] May I reach
[4155.26 → 4156.40] her best
[4156.40 → 4158.06] rise of my
[4158.06 → 4159.78] touchstone.
[4160.38 → 4162.14] Heart of my
[4162.14 → 4163.28] own heart,
[4163.36 → 4164.50] whatever
[4164.50 → 4166.78] be done.
[4167.42 → 4168.46] Still be
[4168.46 → 4170.04] thy vision,
[4170.46 → 4171.88] O ruler
[4171.88 → 4173.98] of all.
[4173.98 → 4174.48] long.
[4174.52 → 4174.54] Amen.
[4174.54 → 4174.68] Amen.
[4174.68 → 4174.82] Amen.
[4185.24 → 4186.50] So each week
[4186.50 → 4187.94] we respond to the
[4187.94 → 4188.78] good news of whom
[4188.78 → 4189.56] God is
[4189.56 → 4190.58] and his grace in
[4190.58 → 4191.10] our lives
[4191.10 → 4192.56] by saying thank you.
[4193.26 → 4194.16] I think thank you to
[4194.16 → 4195.06] God, and we express
[4195.06 → 4195.74] that thanks
[4195.74 → 4197.18] by giving back to
[4197.18 → 4198.28] God of our time
[4198.28 → 4198.92] and our talents
[4198.92 → 4199.56] and our treasures.
[4200.54 → 4205.64] And as we worship God in this way, we participate not only what he is doing here in our community,
[4205.64 → 4207.66] but also around the world.
[4208.34 → 4215.06] And especially as we support today our designated offering for Hannah Vanderkamp with Resonate Global Mission.
[4215.30 → 4223.72] She is working on the island of Lesbos doing refugee care, teaching English, caring for those who have been displaced.
[4224.46 → 4228.46] And so let's give as the Spirit puts on our hearts to give.
[4228.46 → 4231.90] May I invite our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[4258.46 → 4260.46] Thank you.
[4260.46 → 4262.46] Thank you.
[4262.46 → 4264.46] Thank you.
[4264.46 → 4266.46] Thank you.
[4266.46 → 4268.46] Thank you.
[4268.46 → 4270.46] Thank you.
[4270.46 → 4272.46] Thank you.
[4272.46 → 4274.46] Thank you.
[4274.46 → 4276.46] Thank you.
[4276.46 → 4278.46] Thank you.
[4278.46 → 4279.46] Thank you.
[4279.46 → 4309.44] Thank you.
[4309.46 → 4339.44] Thank you.
[4339.46 → 4341.46] Thank you.
[4358.28 → 4366.28] Let's go now to the Lord in prayer as we lift just the needs of our own church family here as well as some of the needs of the world.
[4366.28 → 4373.46] Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth.
[4374.72 → 4376.50] Serve the Lord with gladness.
[4377.36 → 4380.14] Come into his presence with singing.
[4381.34 → 4384.16] Know that the Lord, he is God.
[4384.16 → 4387.66] It is he who made us, and we are his.
[4388.08 → 4391.72] We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[4391.72 → 4405.46] So Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning yet again confident that you accept our prayers, you hear our prayers through the intercession of our Lord Jesus and through the Holy Spirit.
[4405.46 → 4408.02] Father, we bow before you.
[4408.16 → 4410.76] We marvel at your majesty and your glory.
[4411.60 → 4417.70] And Lord, we are humbled to praise you with joy and with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[4417.70 → 4420.98] We thank you, Lord, for the gift of music today.
[4421.54 → 4424.74] Our ability, Lord, to freely praise you in song.
[4424.74 → 4428.62] And we pray, Lord, that it would be honouring to you.
[4430.00 → 4436.04] Lord, we thank you for this city in which we live of Delta and all those who live here.
[4436.04 → 4448.24] Lord, please be with all those who are our neighbours, who are lonely, who are new to our city, those who struggle financially or physically or mentally or in some other way.
[4449.28 → 4452.88] Lord, lead all those who do not know you yet.
[4453.68 → 4465.52] Lord, lead them to our church or even another church in our city where they can meet you, the God who is full of compassion and love.
[4467.00 → 4470.72] We thank you, Lord, for the churches of this city that proclaim your name.
[4471.54 → 4480.44] Lord, and we pray for your blessing upon their ministry and that you would grant them fruitfulness as your people abide in you and abide in your word.
[4480.80 → 4486.78] And help us, Lord, here as Ladder CRC to be a light in your community.
[4488.68 → 4494.56] Whether, Lord, we are at home, at school, at work, or just out and about.
[4494.56 → 4500.04] Lord, we pray that you would use us as instruments to spread the good news of the gospel.
[4501.66 → 4504.46] We thank you, Lord, for the church family that we have here.
[4504.88 → 4506.90] And we thank you, Lord, for each person here today.
[4506.90 → 4511.72] We thank you, Lord, for the gifts and the talents that you have blessed each of us with.
[4512.64 → 4517.30] And ask that you would help us to bless one another with these gifts.
[4518.22 → 4524.62] Open our eyes, Lord, to those among us who may be lonely or discouraged or sick or suffering.
[4524.62 → 4531.62] So that we might serve one another with prayer and support and encouragement and love.
[4532.48 → 4534.36] So, Lord, would you be at work among us.
[4535.18 → 4540.94] Helping us to forgive willingly and to work diligently, Lord, for your kingdom.
[4540.94 → 4545.96] We pray, especially this morning, Lord, for Shirley Ross.
[4547.10 → 4553.90] Lord, who has had some quite serious concerning health problems, Lord.
[4554.00 → 4559.58] And as she's in Richmond Hospital, Lord, we pray for your mercy upon her.
[4559.66 → 4564.32] We thank you, Lord, for just the report we heard yesterday from Mel that she is doing somewhat better.
[4564.32 → 4569.82] But, Lord, we know that there are still problems, Lord, that need your care.
[4570.70 → 4576.00] So, Lord, would you surround Shirley, Lord, with the knowledge of your love and your presence.
[4576.52 → 4580.96] Lord, be with her doctors to help determine the best courses of treatment.
[4581.88 → 4589.26] And be with Mel, Lord, and support him and strengthen him as he loves and cares for Shirley Ross as well.
[4589.26 → 4593.64] And, Lord, we pray for Mustafa this morning, Fall.
[4594.24 → 4597.92] Lord, as Mustafa's brother just passed away in Iran.
[4598.98 → 4605.24] And, Lord, that's such a hard thing when those we love are taken from us.
[4605.28 → 4609.06] So, Lord, would you comfort Mustafa especially and all of his family.
[4610.08 → 4615.22] Lord, you surround them with your love and minister, Lord, to their hearts.
[4615.82 → 4618.36] We thank you, Lord, for the hope that we have in you.
[4619.82 → 4625.24] Lord, help us again as we eagerly await the return of Jesus who will come to renew
[4625.24 → 4630.24] and to restore this good world which was corrupted by sin.
[4631.30 → 4637.02] Lord, we wait for him to come and redeem and renew all things through the death and resurrection of Christ.
[4637.48 → 4641.82] Help us, Lord, to live as ambassadors of your kingdom and to be witnesses of your love.
[4641.90 → 4643.78] And we ask this in Christ's name.
[4644.44 → 4644.74] Amen.
[4644.74 → 4651.96] Let's all stand as we prepare to go out from here.
[4652.54 → 4658.18] We go out having been called and gathered as his sheep, but we don't just stay huddled together.
[4658.58 → 4663.12] We go out to live for Christ in the world with his presence with us.
[4663.12 → 4669.92] And so we go out with his blessing and do stay for time of fellowship right after the service in the fellowship hall.
[4670.32 → 4673.24] So I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4673.24 → 4680.16] Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep,
[4680.50 → 4684.06] by the blood of the eternal covenant, would he equip you with everything good,
[4684.50 → 4688.86] that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[4689.44 → 4692.86] through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
