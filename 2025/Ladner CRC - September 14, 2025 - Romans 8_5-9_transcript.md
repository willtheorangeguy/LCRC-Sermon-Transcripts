[0.00 --> 10.96]  And
[10.96 --> 11.96]  Amen.
[40.96 --> 42.96]  Amen.
[70.96 --> 72.96]  Amen.
[100.96 --> 102.96]  Amen.
[130.96 --> 132.96]  Amen.
[160.96 --> 162.96]  Amen.
[190.96 --> 192.96]  Amen.
[220.96 --> 222.96]  Amen.
[250.96 --> 252.96]  Amen.
[280.96 --> 282.96]  Amen.
[310.96 --> 326.40]  Good morning.
[326.40 --> 327.34]  Good morning.
[327.34 --> 330.02]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[330.02 --> 331.38]  My name is Jason Truel.
[331.38 --> 335.90]  I'm one of the pastors here and it is my delight to lead us in worship this morning.
[335.90 --> 338.36]  Can you hear me okay?
[338.36 --> 340.48]  No, how are we doing?
[340.48 --> 344.72]  This one?
[344.72 --> 349.72]  Test, test, test.
[349.72 --> 350.72]  Hello, hello.
[350.72 --> 351.72]  No?
[351.72 --> 352.72]  Okay.
[352.72 --> 358.80]  We'll use the pulpit mic.
[358.80 --> 363.80]  Any mic.
[363.80 --> 372.40]  It's not my gift.
[372.40 --> 373.40]  One of these?
[373.40 --> 376.40]  All right.
[376.40 --> 379.40]  Hello, hello.
[379.40 --> 380.92]  Ah, that's better.
[380.92 --> 381.92]  Good morning.
[381.92 --> 384.92]  Welcome to Landon Christian Reformed Church.
[384.92 --> 391.40]  If you didn't hear me the first time, my name is, hello, are we still on?
[391.40 --> 393.40]  We're good.
[393.40 --> 394.40]  My name is Jason.
[394.40 --> 397.60]  It's my pleasure to lead us in worship today.
[397.60 --> 400.36]  And today is Family Worship Sunday.
[400.36 --> 406.84]  It's the day when we, as one big happy church family, so to speak, worship together.
[406.84 --> 409.98]  We celebrate the Lord's Supper together.
[409.98 --> 414.72]  And also, if you are a visitor, we are so glad that you are with us today, and we love
[414.72 --> 419.58]  to get to know you and to welcome you to our church family.
[419.58 --> 422.64]  And so, a few announcements as we begin.
[422.64 --> 426.84]  So today, after the service, is our fall barbecue.
[426.84 --> 429.02]  This is kind of an annual thing we do.
[429.02 --> 432.10]  It's a bit rainy, but it may clear up later.
[432.10 --> 433.10]  But please do stay.
[433.10 --> 438.84]  You're invited to stay to join us for hot dogs, hamburgers after the service.
[438.84 --> 446.30]  Also, today at 2 o'clock, there will be singing at Mountain View Manor, which is perfect because
[446.30 --> 447.36]  there's lunch here.
[448.16 --> 452.84]  And then we just go on over at 2 o'clock, and we can sing together to bless the residents
[452.84 --> 454.22]  of Mountain View Manor.
[454.22 --> 462.24]  Another thing to take notice of is that we have a choir that is getting ready to be formed,
[462.24 --> 466.98]  who will sing for us on our church anniversary.
[467.64 --> 472.28]  And so, if you would like to join this choir, the rehearsal starts Monday night at 7 o'clock.
[472.28 --> 478.48]  And please do put your name on the sign-up sheet so that Marianne can prepare the right number
[478.48 --> 480.08]  of music sheets.
[480.44 --> 483.94]  So, Monday, 7 o'clock, is the choir rehearsal.
[484.60 --> 487.82]  Then we have one more announcement from our chair of council, Joe Schulk.
[487.82 --> 515.76]  Today, I'm sharing with you as part of the 75th anniversary committee, Ladner CRC's 75th anniversary,
[515.76 --> 519.10]  18th and 19th of October.
[520.22 --> 522.46]  I have three things to tell you.
[522.90 --> 524.14]  No, this is not a sermon.
[525.66 --> 531.48]  One, everyone is going to be welcome to this event.
[531.92 --> 532.82]  It's a big event.
[533.16 --> 539.86]  Saturday the 18th, about 2 o'clock, we'll have things in the foyer, fellowship hall,
[540.02 --> 541.30]  fireside room set up.
[542.16 --> 543.64]  We have a bunch of displays.
[543.64 --> 549.12]  It's a good time of fellowship, followed by a service at about 3.15.
[549.90 --> 553.30]  So, please, think about now.
[553.70 --> 554.42]  Think about coming.
[555.24 --> 559.72]  And what we need you to do is RSVP, please.
[560.26 --> 560.58]  Email.
[561.12 --> 562.32]  Come in and see Dorothy.
[562.60 --> 563.08]  Phone her.
[563.92 --> 567.10]  Let one of the committee members know that you'd like to attend.
[567.10 --> 571.94]  We really do need to have a number of people that are coming.
[572.08 --> 573.04]  We need to know that.
[573.58 --> 582.10]  Two, if anyone has any memorabilia, historic stuff, pictures, things.
[582.10 --> 587.70]  The porcelain pig from Raise the Roof a couple of times will be here.
[588.64 --> 599.48]  Some of the trophies from the four-legged race and the tug-of-wars and a few other things that used to happen at church picnics.
[599.72 --> 601.20]  They will be on display.
[601.46 --> 602.82]  We need more stuff.
[602.82 --> 606.40]  Please, check your memorabilia drawers.
[607.48 --> 608.52]  And I know they're deep.
[609.46 --> 610.78]  And there's many.
[611.34 --> 611.94]  But check them.
[612.52 --> 614.30]  And come, bring them in.
[614.54 --> 616.26]  There will be a big box in the council room.
[616.74 --> 617.38]  You can leave them.
[617.46 --> 622.02]  Make sure you put your name and what event it was and or the time period.
[622.36 --> 623.24]  Really be helpful.
[623.48 --> 623.80]  Three.
[623.80 --> 623.92]  Three.
[625.14 --> 625.66]  Everyone.
[626.56 --> 628.26]  Circle your calendar now.
[629.16 --> 630.10]  Come and join us.
[630.96 --> 632.94]  18th and 19th of October.
[633.08 --> 637.16]  19th of October will be a special worship service that Sunday.
[637.86 --> 639.80]  But please, do think about it.
[640.32 --> 648.60]  Get a hold of your acquaintances, former members of this congregation that were here a long time ago or even not too long ago.
[649.20 --> 650.12]  Please get a hold of them.
[650.24 --> 651.92]  See if they want to join us also.
[651.92 --> 654.34]  We'd like everyone to come.
[654.74 --> 655.52]  Please join us.
[655.62 --> 656.08]  Thank you.
[671.96 --> 674.86]  So we go now to the worship of the Lord.
[674.86 --> 683.18]  And it's interesting as we look at scripture that there is actually only one thing that it says that God is seeking.
[683.96 --> 686.18]  And that is worshipers.
[686.82 --> 686.92]  Right?
[687.06 --> 691.34]  Worshippers who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[691.34 --> 695.74]  And the Bible tells us that God is reclaiming humanity.
[695.74 --> 702.58]  He is creating a people for himself who will do the very thing that we were created to do, which is to worship him.
[703.30 --> 714.16]  And so when we gather together, get together every Sunday, we are having that opportunity to practice and to grow in what it means to be worshipers of God.
[714.16 --> 719.50]  And so let's do that now as God calls us to worship this morning.
[719.50 --> 723.94]  Sing to God.
[723.94 --> 726.44]  Sing in praise of his name.
[726.82 --> 728.98]  Extol him who rides on the clouds.
[729.68 --> 731.18]  Rejoice before him.
[731.66 --> 733.42]  His name is the Lord.
[733.60 --> 734.06]  Together.
[734.06 --> 742.20]  A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.
[743.28 --> 751.38]  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[752.54 --> 759.10]  Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[759.10 --> 765.08]  Father, please join me in a prayer of adoration as we come before this God in praise.
[765.24 --> 765.56]  Let's pray.
[766.92 --> 775.52]  Heavenly Father, you tell us that we are never more fully human than when our lives are oriented toward you in worship.
[776.44 --> 788.28]  And therefore, Lord, there is nothing more satisfying than to give our hearts and our minds, our strength and our souls to worship you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[789.10 --> 793.92]  And although we have failed to give you the praise, do your name.
[794.96 --> 800.14]  Lord, you have sought us and you have bought us through the blood of Christ.
[800.82 --> 807.94]  And so we ask, oh Lord, that you would bring us today into your presence because of the work of your Son on our behalf.
[808.82 --> 814.14]  Bring us this morning into the joy of our inheritance as your children.
[814.14 --> 825.40]  Lord, awaken us again to see your glory and your grace that we might respond in singing your praise and doing so in spirit and in truth.
[825.96 --> 830.04]  We come to you in the name of our Lord and your Son, Jesus Christ.
[830.40 --> 830.68]  Amen.
[832.10 --> 834.72]  Let's stand in body or in spirit as you are able.
[835.50 --> 839.90]  God greets us this morning with these words from Psalm 68.
[839.90 --> 840.04]  Amen.
[840.04 --> 840.08]  Amen.
[840.08 --> 840.10]  Amen.
[844.14 --> 847.60]  You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary.
[848.30 --> 851.94]  The God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.
[852.88 --> 856.64]  So as God has greeted us and welcomed us, let's turn and welcome and greet one another.
[856.64 --> 856.74]  Amen.
[856.74 --> 856.84]  Amen.
[856.84 --> 856.92]  Amen.
[856.92 --> 857.04]  Amen.
[857.04 --> 857.24]  Amen.
[857.24 --> 857.84]  Amen.
[857.84 --> 858.84]  Amen.
[858.84 --> 859.84]  Amen.
[859.84 --> 860.84]  Amen.
[860.84 --> 861.84]  Amen.
[861.84 --> 862.84]  Amen.
[862.84 --> 863.84]  Amen.
[863.84 --> 864.84]  Amen.
[864.84 --> 865.84]  Amen.
[865.84 --> 866.84]  Amen.
[866.84 --> 867.84]  Amen.
[867.84 --> 868.84]  Amen.
[868.84 --> 869.84]  Amen.
[869.84 --> 870.84]  Amen.
[870.84 --> 871.84]  Amen.
[871.84 --> 872.84]  Amen.
[872.84 --> 873.84]  Amen.
[873.84 --> 882.34]  Amen.
[882.34 --> 901.54]  Amen.
[901.54 --> 902.54]  Amen.
[902.54 --> 903.04]  Amen.
[903.04 --> 903.54]  Amen.
[903.54 --> 925.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[925.42 --> 933.42]  O God, O praise Him. He is exalted, forever exalted,
[933.42 --> 940.42]  And I will praise His name.
[940.42 --> 949.42]  He is the Lord, forever His truth shall reign.
[949.42 --> 957.42]  Heaven and earth rejoice in His holy name.
[957.42 --> 961.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[961.42 --> 965.42]  O God. He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[965.42 --> 969.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[969.42 --> 971.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[971.42 --> 977.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[977.42 --> 981.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted,
[981.42 --> 983.42]  I will praise Him.
[983.42 --> 993.42]  The King is exalted, the King is exalted,
[993.42 --> 998.42]  The King is exalted, He is exalted,
[998.42 --> 1000.42]  But He is exalted, He is exalted.
[1000.42 --> 1001.42]  He will be exalted, the King is exalted to each one.
[1001.42 --> 1017.42]  He is the Lord, forever His church shall win
[1017.42 --> 1025.42]  As the Lord rejoicing His fallen sin
[1025.42 --> 1034.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high
[1034.42 --> 1043.42]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high
[1055.42 --> 1071.42]  My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like Him
[1071.42 --> 1086.42]  All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of the mighty love
[1086.42 --> 1098.34]  For Heilから momentum to go to heaven
[1099.42 --> 1111.42]  Your narrative will come to heaven
[1111.42 --> 1117.40]  But the morning, I can't describe.
[1117.40 --> 1122.38]  How are we doing so the день bracing forth?
[1122.38 --> 1123.20]  Unfortunately.
[1123.20 --> 1126.28]  I'm not even so rolling.
[1126.28 --> 1130.20]  I can't deal with Teresa.
[1130.20 --> 1134.74]  What was that?
[1134.74 --> 1137.64]  Thanks for joy.
[1137.64 --> 1140.02]  And the body reserve.
[1140.02 --> 1146.34]  Forever on the land and forever on the land
[1146.34 --> 1155.38]  Nothing so blessed does the promise I see in You
[1159.38 --> 1164.82]  My Jesus, my Savior
[1164.82 --> 1169.38]  Lord, there's no one like You
[1169.38 --> 1174.98]  All of my days I want to place
[1174.98 --> 1183.70]  The wonders of Your mighty love
[1183.70 --> 1186.90]  So I should love you
[1186.90 --> 1189.70]  My Jesus, my Savior
[1189.70 --> 1193.70]  In the Sabbath, I need you
[1193.70 --> 1199.30]  The Lord, there's no one like you
[1199.30 --> 1206.30]  I will never be in love with you.
[1206.30 --> 1212.30]  I will never be in love with you.
[1212.30 --> 1218.30]  I will never be in love with you.
[1218.30 --> 1223.30]  Mountains bow down and the seas may roll.
[1223.30 --> 1230.30]  At the sun of the dawn's early.
[1230.30 --> 1235.30]  I shall fall down in the night of your hands.
[1235.30 --> 1241.30]  Forever and I will forever be in love with you.
[1241.30 --> 1247.30]  I will never be in love with you.
[1247.30 --> 1253.30]  I will never be in love with you.
[1253.30 --> 1264.30]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1265.30 --> 1268.30]  You may be seated.
[1268.30 --> 1278.30]  We come now to a time of confession.
[1278.30 --> 1293.30]  We come now to a time of confession.
[1293.30 --> 1299.30]  And in the Gospels we read about how one time Jesus was talking with the crowds and the Pharisees.
[1299.30 --> 1301.30]  And he was teaching them.
[1301.30 --> 1304.30]  And someone asked Jesus,
[1304.30 --> 1307.30]  Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
[1307.30 --> 1310.30]  And this is how Jesus answered.
[1310.30 --> 1312.30]  Matthew 22.
[1312.30 --> 1320.30]  Jesus answered, Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your mind.
[1320.30 --> 1323.30]  This is the first and greatest commandment.
[1323.30 --> 1325.30]  And the second is like it.
[1325.30 --> 1327.30]  Love your neighbor as yourself.
[1327.30 --> 1332.30]  All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.
[1332.30 --> 1344.30]  And so in other words, Jesus is giving us a picture of what it means to fully mirror who he is.
[1344.30 --> 1346.30]  What it means to be fully human.
[1346.30 --> 1350.30]  And if we're honest, we realize that there is a gap.
[1350.30 --> 1356.30]  There's a gap between Jesus as the perfect man and who we are.
[1356.30 --> 1358.30]  Because we don't love like that.
[1358.30 --> 1361.30]  We don't love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[1361.30 --> 1363.30]  Or our neighbor as ourselves.
[1363.30 --> 1370.30]  And yet one of the ways that we can close that gap is through this time of confession.
[1370.30 --> 1374.30]  When we acknowledge that and we ask God to transform us.
[1374.30 --> 1377.30]  And so that's what we're going to do together in this time.
[1377.30 --> 1380.30]  And I will lead us in a prayer of confession.
[1380.30 --> 1383.30]  So would you please pray with me.
[1383.30 --> 1392.30]  Merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought and in word and in deed.
[1392.30 --> 1399.30]  We confess that we have not loved you with our whole heart and mind and strength.
[1399.30 --> 1402.30]  And we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
[1402.30 --> 1415.30]  O Lord, in your great mercy, forgive our sin and help us by your Holy Spirit to delight in your will and to walk in your ways to the glory of your holy name.
[1415.30 --> 1416.30]  Amen.
[1416.30 --> 1427.30]  So brothers and sisters, the good news is that Jesus will stop at nothing to make his people more and more like him.
[1427.30 --> 1432.30]  Because of his relentless yet tender love for us.
[1432.30 --> 1435.30]  And so hear these words of assurance from the prophet Micah.
[1435.30 --> 1437.30]  Micah says,
[1437.30 --> 1438.30]  Micah says,
[1438.30 --> 1445.30]  Who is a God like you who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?
[1445.30 --> 1450.30]  You do not stay angry forever, but delight to show mercy.
[1450.30 --> 1453.30]  You will again have compassion on us.
[1453.30 --> 1461.30]  You will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
[1461.30 --> 1464.30]  That is our God.
[1464.30 --> 1466.30]  So let's respond to his grace and mercy.
[1466.30 --> 1470.30]  Let's stand once more and let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1470.30 --> 1471.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1471.30 --> 1477.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1477.30 --> 1484.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1484.30 --> 1487.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1487.30 --> 1492.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1492.30 --> 1494.30]  Let's sing Jesus Strong and Kind.
[1494.30 --> 1504.30]  Jesus said that if I thirst I should come to Him.
[1504.30 --> 1513.30]  No one else can satisfy, I should come to you.
[1513.30 --> 1522.30]  If I am soft, I should seek Him.
[1522.30 --> 1531.30]  If no one can become my power, I should seek Him.
[1531.30 --> 1541.30]  For the Lord is good and safe, He will be sure to stay and be.
[1541.30 --> 1551.30]  In the tomb of His blood, so Jesus, Jesus, love is young.
[1551.30 --> 1568.30]  Jesus said that if I fear, I should come to Him.
[1568.30 --> 1578.30]  No one else can be my shield, I should come to Him.
[1578.30 --> 1586.30]  For the Lord is good and safe, He will be sure to stay and be.
[1586.30 --> 1596.30]  The Lord is always one to Jesus, Jesus, love is young.
[1596.30 --> 1613.30]  Jesus said that if I am strong, I will seek Him.
[1613.30 --> 1615.30]  He will seek Him.
[1615.30 --> 1619.30]  He will seek Him.
[1619.30 --> 1621.30]  He will seek Him.
[1621.30 --> 1623.30]  He will seek Him.
[1623.30 --> 1629.30]  For the Lord is good and safe, He will be sure to stay and be.
[1629.30 --> 1631.30]  He will seek Him.
[1631.30 --> 1633.30]  He will seek Him.
[1633.30 --> 1635.30]  He will seek Him.
[1635.30 --> 1638.30]  For the Lord is good and safe, He will be sure to stay and be.
[1638.30 --> 1639.30]  He will seek Him.
[1639.30 --> 1643.30]  I should come to Him.
[1643.30 --> 1652.26]  For the Lord is good and faithful, we will keep our state and life.
[1652.26 --> 1661.98]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus song and time.
[1662.74 --> 1667.92]  Jesus song and time.
[1669.92 --> 1671.36]  May we sing.
[1673.30 --> 1687.92]  Test. Oh, hey. Yeah. We're good. Yay.
[1688.56 --> 1691.30]  So we come now to the Lord's table.
[1692.12 --> 1700.68]  To this meal that was prepared by Jesus and given by Christ himself for us and for our redemption.
[1700.68 --> 1712.00]  And receiving this by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are united to the risen and ascended and soon to return Christ.
[1712.00 --> 1717.22]  And so we confess our faith together as we begin this meal.
[1718.00 --> 1728.44]  And so because it is the big anniversary, 1,700 year anniversary of the Nicene Creed,
[1728.68 --> 1731.14]  I've said we're going to be reciting that in these months.
[1731.38 --> 1734.32]  So let's recite together the Nicene Creed.
[1734.32 --> 1745.76]  We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
[1745.76 --> 1755.10]  And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages.
[1755.92 --> 1766.56]  God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same essence as the Father.
[1766.56 --> 1773.00]  Through him all things were made for us and for our salvation.
[1773.00 --> 1775.40]  He came down from heaven.
[1776.34 --> 1782.68]  He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made human.
[1783.74 --> 1787.44]  He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.
[1788.02 --> 1790.04]  He suffered and was buried.
[1790.84 --> 1794.68]  The third day he rose again according to the scriptures.
[1794.68 --> 1800.22]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[1800.98 --> 1805.82]  He will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead.
[1806.30 --> 1808.40]  His kingdom will never end.
[1809.26 --> 1814.14]  And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life.
[1814.82 --> 1822.12]  He proceeds from the Father and the Son, and with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified.
[1822.52 --> 1824.56]  He spoke through the prophets.
[1824.68 --> 1829.98]  We believe in one holy, Catholic, and apostolic church.
[1830.80 --> 1834.56]  We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
[1834.82 --> 1841.32]  We look forward to the resurrection of the dead and to life in the world to come.
[1841.74 --> 1842.22]  Amen.
[1842.22 --> 1849.32]  Well, friends, if this is your faith, what we confess together, the faith of the church.
[1850.10 --> 1854.84]  And if you have been baptized into the church, then this meal is for you.
[1854.84 --> 1862.60]  If you are here this morning and you are not yet a follower of Jesus, we are so glad that you are here.
[1863.02 --> 1864.76]  We invite you to remain with us.
[1864.76 --> 1874.46]  And rather than receiving this meal, because it's a meal that can only be received by faith, we invite you to instead receive Jesus Christ.
[1874.68 --> 1875.90]  Receive him as your Lord.
[1876.74 --> 1878.28]  Confess your need for him.
[1878.54 --> 1881.66]  Worship and honor him as your creator and as your savior.
[1881.66 --> 1886.76]  And if you would love to learn more about that, please, maybe after the service, talk to me.
[1887.08 --> 1887.92]  Talk to Pastor Nancy.
[1887.92 --> 1894.78]  So, friends, hear these words of the institution of the supper.
[1895.30 --> 1898.30]  The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread.
[1898.94 --> 1901.30]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[1901.30 --> 1903.94]  This is my body, which is for you.
[1904.58 --> 1906.50]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1907.44 --> 1911.18]  In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1911.46 --> 1915.60]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1916.30 --> 1917.90]  Do this whenever you drink it.
[1917.92 --> 1919.40]  In remembrance of me.
[1920.18 --> 1924.06]  For whenever you eat this bread and you drink this cup,
[1924.42 --> 1927.94]  You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1928.46 --> 1931.50]  So let's pray together and ask for God's blessing upon this meal.
[1932.82 --> 1939.94]  Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you in praise and in adoration and in awe and in thanksgiving.
[1940.70 --> 1944.44]  Lord, thanking you for the work of Christ on our behalf.
[1944.44 --> 1951.76]  And we now ask that your Holy Spirit would set apart this bread and this cup, Lord, for your holy purposes.
[1952.52 --> 1960.36]  That by receiving them through faith, our hearts would be united to Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[1960.36 --> 1964.90]  Bless this meal, Lord, for the nourishment of your people.
[1965.34 --> 1966.70]  We ask in Christ's name.
[1967.50 --> 1967.98]  Amen.
[1968.82 --> 1972.26]  And let's put our communion liturgy together, which will be on the screen.
[1973.26 --> 1975.44]  Brothers and sisters, lift up your hearts.
[1976.00 --> 1979.78]  We are his people.
[1979.78 --> 1982.80]  We are redeemed by his grace.
[1983.08 --> 1985.32]  Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1985.96 --> 1987.16]  Christ has died.
[1987.56 --> 1988.64]  Christ is risen.
[1989.14 --> 1990.60]  Christ will come again.
[1991.28 --> 1994.16]  Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1994.34 --> 1994.66]  Hallelujah.
[1994.66 --> 1994.78]  Hallelujah.
[1995.22 --> 1995.82]  Hallelujah.
[1996.36 --> 1999.80]  Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[2000.44 --> 2005.06]  Take them by faith and feed on him with thanksgiving.
[2006.34 --> 2009.46]  May I ask our elders who are serving to come forward.
[2009.62 --> 2010.74]  Help me distribute the elements.
[2010.74 --> 2023.62]  May I ask your talents.
[2023.62 --> 2053.60]  Thank you.
[2053.62 --> 2083.60]  Thank you.
[2083.62 --> 2113.60]  Thank you.
[2113.62 --> 2143.60]  Thank you.
[2143.62 --> 2173.60]  Thank you.
[2173.62 --> 2203.60]  Thank you.
[2203.62 --> 2233.60]  Thank you.
[2233.60 --> 2235.60]  Thank you.
[2263.60 --> 2265.60]  Thank you.
[2293.60 --> 2295.60]  Thank you.
[2323.60 --> 2325.60]  Thank you.
[2353.60 --> 2355.60]  Thank you.
[2383.60 --> 2385.60]  Thank you.
[2413.60 --> 2415.60]  Thank you.
[2415.60 --> 2417.60]  Thank you.
[2417.60 --> 2419.60]  Thank you.
[2419.60 --> 2421.60]  Thank you.
[2421.60 --> 2423.60]  Thank you.
[2423.60 --> 2425.60]  Thank you.
[2425.60 --> 2427.60]  Thank you.
[2427.60 --> 2429.60]  Thank you.
[2429.60 --> 2431.60]  Thank you.
[2431.60 --> 2433.60]  Thank you.
[2433.60 --> 2435.60]  Thank you.
[2459.60 --> 2461.60]  Thank you.
[2461.60 --> 2463.60]  Thank you.
[2463.60 --> 2484.00]  for you. Let's drink together. Let's pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, for this tangible sign,
[2484.62 --> 2492.00]  the sign of the bread and the cup, Lord, which is a symbol of your immense, immeasurable love
[2492.00 --> 2497.40]  that was poured out for us. And Lord, it was poured out as you shed your blood. And a blood not, Lord,
[2497.44 --> 2505.74]  of death, but a blood of life. A blood that restored us to life. And Lord, that continues to
[2505.74 --> 2511.86]  nourish us as we seek to follow in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2512.42 --> 2518.94]  Lord, would you continue, Lord, to nourish us in this grace in which we now stand. And we pray in
[2518.94 --> 2538.32]  Jesus' name. Amen. Okay, so at this time, we'll dismiss our Chinese congregation to go to their
[2538.32 --> 2543.18]  service and are now invited to go to their Sunday school classes.
[2548.94 --> 2550.94]  Amen.
[2578.94 --> 2587.16]  All right, so this morning, we are in Romans chapter 8. And we're going to be looking this
[2587.16 --> 2594.80]  morning at verses 5, verse 5 through to verse 9. So if you want to follow along in the Pew Bible,
[2595.06 --> 2600.20]  you can turn there with me to Romans chapter 8. You know, the words in our Pew Bible are always a
[2600.20 --> 2604.12]  little bit different than the words on the screen. But I'll read it first from this version, and then
[2604.12 --> 2612.90]  we'll be preaching from the 2011 version. But this is on page 841, if you're following along, 841.
[2613.96 --> 2619.60]  And we'll read verses 5 to 9. Let's give our attention to the reading of God's Word.
[2621.60 --> 2628.50]  Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires.
[2628.50 --> 2635.60]  But those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
[2636.64 --> 2643.14]  The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.
[2644.20 --> 2648.86]  The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
[2649.78 --> 2652.38]  Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.
[2652.38 --> 2660.38]  You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.
[2661.00 --> 2666.16]  And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.
[2667.08 --> 2668.36]  This is the Word of the Lord.
[2669.82 --> 2678.08]  And so, you know, even as we read this, what we discover is that Romans 8 is all about the grace of God.
[2678.08 --> 2685.26]  And the wonderful thing is we could spend our entire lives exploring God's grace,
[2685.38 --> 2693.10]  trying to more deeply understand God's grace, and still we would never get to the bottom of how wonderful God's grace is.
[2694.08 --> 2700.82]  But it is going to be fun to try, and that's what we're trying to do over the next many weeks of this fall
[2700.82 --> 2704.06]  as we kind of make our way through Romans 8 in the coming weeks.
[2704.06 --> 2708.66]  But as we come to our passage today, let's stop and let's pray and ask for God's blessing.
[2711.22 --> 2717.08]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day of worship where we are here not only to give you praise,
[2717.74 --> 2722.02]  though that is what we do, but Lord, we are also here to receive from you.
[2722.70 --> 2724.20]  Because, Lord, that is what you do.
[2725.06 --> 2729.94]  You nourish us, those under your care, Lord, with your Word.
[2729.94 --> 2734.24]  And we pray, Lord, that we would be fed now with the spiritual food of your Word
[2734.24 --> 2737.16]  by the power of your Holy Spirit,
[2738.00 --> 2740.44]  so that Christ would be magnified in us.
[2740.96 --> 2742.72]  We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2745.00 --> 2747.88]  So we're looking at verses 5 through 9,
[2748.00 --> 2751.70]  and what we see in this passage is that God's message for us,
[2752.12 --> 2754.54]  kind of the main idea here this morning,
[2754.54 --> 2760.28]  is that there are, at the end of the day, two kinds of people.
[2761.50 --> 2764.20]  There are, at the end of the day, just two kinds of people.
[2764.90 --> 2768.18]  And there are any number of ways that we can take all of humanity
[2768.18 --> 2769.70]  and kind of split them into two.
[2770.52 --> 2773.28]  You know, well, obviously there are men and women.
[2773.54 --> 2774.60]  That's one way we could do it.
[2775.42 --> 2780.26]  There are those on the political right and those on the political left, you know.
[2780.26 --> 2784.70]  And that's a division that we often see in our world, especially in the news.
[2786.18 --> 2788.70]  We can divide humanity by personality.
[2789.02 --> 2791.56]  There are introverts and extroverts.
[2791.80 --> 2792.88]  Who here is an introvert?
[2794.44 --> 2795.36]  Does anybody know?
[2795.90 --> 2797.12]  Who is an extrovert?
[2798.28 --> 2800.84]  Okay, and I could ask you, okay, who's on the political right?
[2800.90 --> 2801.34]  Who's on the left?
[2801.42 --> 2802.04]  I don't want to do that.
[2802.56 --> 2806.34]  But just to acknowledge, hey, there's probably people on both sides of the spectrum here.
[2806.34 --> 2810.46]  There are men and women, obviously.
[2811.58 --> 2815.28]  And then there are those who prefer French vanilla ice cream
[2815.28 --> 2818.74]  and those who like homestyle vanilla ice cream.
[2820.50 --> 2820.94]  Right?
[2821.78 --> 2825.34]  I guess because when I go to the grocery store, they have these options,
[2825.46 --> 2828.78]  which makes it challenging when I have to go to the grocery store, buy ice cream,
[2828.78 --> 2834.02]  and I always feel like I bring home the one that my family doesn't quite prefer as much.
[2834.28 --> 2837.14]  And then I just remember I got the wrong one.
[2837.26 --> 2839.90]  But then the next time I go, I can't remember which one I'm supposed to get.
[2840.72 --> 2844.60]  But all the world can be divided into those who like French vanilla or homestyle.
[2844.60 --> 2852.00]  And so there are any number of ways that we could kind of split humanity into two.
[2852.24 --> 2852.32]  Right?
[2852.38 --> 2857.66]  It's fun to notice those different temperaments, those different personalities that people have.
[2858.60 --> 2866.74]  But the message that Paul has for us in Romans 8 is that there are really two types of people in the world.
[2866.74 --> 2871.90]  That really there's only ultimately one distinction that is fundamental
[2871.90 --> 2878.10]  that is determining of everything else that we could say about someone or most everything.
[2879.22 --> 2883.38]  And that distinction that we see here, it's deeper than politics.
[2883.74 --> 2885.48]  It's deeper than our personalities.
[2886.00 --> 2888.28]  It's deeper than our ice cream preferences.
[2888.94 --> 2894.54]  It's deeper than anything that we might care about or choose to care about.
[2894.54 --> 2901.60]  And so what is most fundamental is whether your life is based on what Paul calls the flesh
[2901.60 --> 2904.26]  or on what Paul calls the spirit.
[2904.92 --> 2905.10]  Okay?
[2905.14 --> 2906.84]  The flesh and the spirit.
[2907.44 --> 2910.24]  So let's look at this passage in verse 5.
[2912.28 --> 2917.54]  Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires.
[2917.88 --> 2923.92]  But those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires.
[2924.54 --> 2926.26]  So now what does that mean?
[2927.12 --> 2931.50]  What does it mean to live according to the flesh or to live according to the spirit?
[2931.66 --> 2936.94]  What does it mean to set your mind on the things of the flesh or to set your minds on the things of the spirit?
[2937.98 --> 2946.98]  Well, one way that we can try to understand these verses is to think about the way we use the word orientation.
[2946.98 --> 2950.36]  Like I have an orientation towards something.
[2951.12 --> 2957.84]  So as we kind of popularly use it, we could say, well, somebody is athletically oriented.
[2958.50 --> 2960.80]  Or somebody is musically oriented.
[2961.24 --> 2965.40]  Or they are, you know, maybe more mechanically oriented.
[2965.70 --> 2967.36]  And when we say that, what do we mean by that?
[2967.36 --> 2975.58]  Usually what we mean is that somebody has a very kind of deep natural ability or a preference in a certain direction.
[2976.28 --> 2977.76]  It's kind of who they are.
[2978.70 --> 2982.84]  And because of that deep orientation in who they are,
[2983.50 --> 2988.52]  that kind of then shapes and governs how they live their lives.
[2988.52 --> 2989.74]  Right?
[2989.84 --> 2992.60]  So it might motivate how you spend your time.
[2993.08 --> 2993.26]  Right?
[2993.32 --> 2999.34]  Whether you join the soccer team or you take music lessons or you spend time building things.
[3000.06 --> 3000.54]  Right?
[3000.56 --> 3001.98]  It captures what you think about.
[3002.40 --> 3007.58]  Like what your mind automatically goes to just because you love to think about those things.
[3007.94 --> 3010.58]  I just, you know, think about soccer all the time.
[3010.66 --> 3011.64]  Or think about music.
[3012.12 --> 3013.36]  Or whatever it is.
[3014.06 --> 3017.66]  You know, if I'm in the shower or I'm in the car or I'm just lying in my bed at night.
[3017.66 --> 3020.72]  That is what kind of consumes my thoughts and my imagination.
[3022.56 --> 3026.24]  It also, kind of who we are, it motivates our decisions.
[3026.74 --> 3028.96]  What job we might go into.
[3029.30 --> 3030.90]  What we might want to study in school.
[3031.74 --> 3033.78]  The source of people we hang out with.
[3035.24 --> 3039.32]  Now, when Paul talks about the flesh and the spirit,
[3039.70 --> 3042.94]  he's talking about something similar to all of that.
[3044.10 --> 3046.68]  And so when Paul talks about the flesh,
[3046.68 --> 3049.20]  he doesn't mean our physical bodies.
[3049.78 --> 3054.16]  He's talking about this natural inclination in every single one of us
[3054.16 --> 3057.10]  that inclines us away from God.
[3057.90 --> 3062.24]  Just like naturally who we are, we are inclined away from God.
[3062.98 --> 3069.26]  And so it's this deep, fundamental preference or orientation in us
[3069.26 --> 3071.42]  to live not close to God,
[3071.86 --> 3076.02]  but the opposite of that, to live independently or apart from God.
[3076.66 --> 3077.92]  And Paul calls that the flesh.
[3079.36 --> 3081.54]  And because we have this deep, fundamental preference
[3081.54 --> 3083.64]  to keep God at arm's length,
[3084.06 --> 3088.78]  that preference then motivates our desires and our thoughts and our actions.
[3088.78 --> 3093.94]  But then Paul talks about the spirit.
[3094.44 --> 3097.36]  And he's talking, of course, about the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.
[3097.96 --> 3102.40]  And this is the spirit that is given to us when we become a Christian.
[3103.80 --> 3104.98]  And so according to the Bible,
[3106.30 --> 3109.10]  these are two kinds of people in the world.
[3109.10 --> 3112.56]  And what you think about, what you set your mind on,
[3112.62 --> 3114.92]  what motivates you, what you desire,
[3115.28 --> 3116.78]  it reveals who you are.
[3117.38 --> 3119.34]  A person of the flesh,
[3119.74 --> 3122.30]  meaning again just someone who is oriented away from God,
[3122.68 --> 3124.10]  or someone of the spirit,
[3124.24 --> 3126.50]  someone who is kind of faced towards God.
[3128.10 --> 3130.68]  And so that's what we're looking at in these verses.
[3130.82 --> 3133.04]  So let's kind of look at these two kinds of people
[3133.04 --> 3136.68]  as Paul gets into it and opens it up for us a bit.
[3136.68 --> 3140.32]  So first, Paul describes the person
[3140.32 --> 3143.08]  whose fundamental orientation is based on the flesh.
[3143.70 --> 3146.10]  And he says three things in these verses.
[3147.56 --> 3150.12]  There are three things that, for some of us,
[3150.16 --> 3151.58]  are very hard to hear.
[3152.30 --> 3153.58]  So three things he says.
[3154.12 --> 3156.90]  The first one is we find in verse 7.
[3158.16 --> 3158.82]  He says,
[3159.34 --> 3161.82]  The mind governed by the flesh,
[3162.44 --> 3163.18]  what is it like?
[3163.80 --> 3164.98]  It's hostile to God.
[3164.98 --> 3166.84]  It's hostile to God.
[3167.28 --> 3169.84]  Well, what does it mean to be hostile to God?
[3171.10 --> 3172.34]  This is what it means.
[3172.54 --> 3174.64]  It's kind of, it's to say to God,
[3175.16 --> 3176.90]  I mean, the way we might think of it is like,
[3177.24 --> 3179.66]  we're always fighting against God, right?
[3180.10 --> 3182.04]  Where everything we do is like against him.
[3183.00 --> 3184.42]  But I think it's more like this.
[3184.46 --> 3185.06]  It's to say,
[3185.32 --> 3188.62]  God, I know that you feed me.
[3188.62 --> 3193.90]  I know that every breath I take is really just breathing in your mercy.
[3194.60 --> 3197.72]  That I live and I move and I have my being in you.
[3198.00 --> 3200.00]  And that without you, I wouldn't exist.
[3200.64 --> 3202.00]  But guess what, God?
[3202.54 --> 3203.74]  I don't really care.
[3204.72 --> 3204.92]  Right?
[3204.98 --> 3206.24]  And I'm just going to ignore you.
[3206.30 --> 3208.96]  And I'm going to live my life however I will please.
[3210.32 --> 3210.52]  Right?
[3210.52 --> 3212.80]  That essentially is what it means to be hostile to God.
[3212.80 --> 3213.28]  Right?
[3213.64 --> 3214.88]  When you don't worship God,
[3214.96 --> 3219.76]  you don't give God the honor and the glory that he is due.
[3220.40 --> 3221.42]  That is hostility.
[3223.00 --> 3224.78]  And the thing is, we often think,
[3224.86 --> 3225.92]  well, that's just indifference.
[3226.12 --> 3228.58]  You know, most people are just kind of indifferent to God.
[3229.34 --> 3229.80]  Right?
[3229.86 --> 3231.16]  They don't go to church.
[3231.28 --> 3232.60]  They don't think about God.
[3232.72 --> 3233.86]  They're just indifferent.
[3233.86 --> 3239.00]  But really, what that is, it's hostility to God.
[3239.70 --> 3242.92]  Because we all were created by God.
[3243.28 --> 3245.50]  And we live in this world that God made.
[3246.00 --> 3248.00]  And yet we fail to acknowledge him.
[3248.12 --> 3250.54]  We live in this world without any reference to him.
[3251.16 --> 3252.46]  That is hostility to God.
[3253.88 --> 3256.04]  And the thing is, according to the book of Romans,
[3256.08 --> 3256.78]  as we've seen,
[3256.96 --> 3261.10]  this is every single human being in our natural state.
[3261.10 --> 3262.86]  So in other words,
[3262.90 --> 3266.10]  from the very moment that we enter into this world,
[3266.24 --> 3267.68]  this is just who we are.
[3268.06 --> 3270.00]  We are born this way.
[3271.34 --> 3273.04]  Which means, friends, that no one,
[3273.22 --> 3274.24]  and you can think of it this way,
[3274.30 --> 3276.08]  no one is born spiritually neutral.
[3276.84 --> 3276.96]  Right?
[3277.00 --> 3279.32]  It's not like when someone enters into this world
[3279.32 --> 3281.42]  that we are kind of this blank sheet of paper.
[3282.22 --> 3282.44]  Right?
[3282.50 --> 3283.84]  Nothing yet is written on it.
[3284.28 --> 3286.04]  And then we begin to just live our lives.
[3286.08 --> 3287.70]  And either we, you know,
[3287.70 --> 3290.18]  kind of begin to lead a life
[3290.18 --> 3291.80]  that is kind of towards God,
[3291.88 --> 3293.22]  and those are like spiritual people,
[3293.46 --> 3296.58]  or we live our lives kind of more away from God.
[3297.18 --> 3298.74]  That's not what Paul is saying at all.
[3299.38 --> 3301.04]  He's saying that all of us
[3301.04 --> 3305.02]  have a natural inborn inclination
[3305.02 --> 3306.90]  away from God.
[3308.06 --> 3308.86]  And because of that,
[3308.92 --> 3310.56]  we are hostile towards God.
[3311.02 --> 3312.56]  We don't set our minds on him.
[3313.10 --> 3314.52]  We set our minds on ourselves.
[3315.86 --> 3315.98]  Okay?
[3315.98 --> 3316.68]  So that's the first thing.
[3316.74 --> 3317.86]  It's hostility to God.
[3317.86 --> 3319.48]  And as we continue,
[3319.66 --> 3321.58]  the second thing we are told in verse 7
[3321.58 --> 3325.72]  is that the mind that is set on the flesh
[3325.72 --> 3327.36]  is not only hostile to God,
[3327.46 --> 3328.18]  but as it says,
[3328.34 --> 3330.50]  it does not submit to God's law,
[3330.62 --> 3332.16]  nor can it do so.
[3333.86 --> 3335.36]  Now this is one of the verses
[3335.36 --> 3340.08]  where we get the T in tulip,
[3340.48 --> 3341.78]  if you're familiar with that.
[3341.90 --> 3343.04]  The T of tulip.
[3343.04 --> 3347.74]  And the doctrine has been called
[3347.74 --> 3349.08]  total depravity.
[3349.18 --> 3350.46]  Now it's called that by those
[3350.46 --> 3351.46]  who don't believe in it,
[3351.58 --> 3353.10]  and it's kind of a negative thing
[3353.10 --> 3354.02]  as an accusation.
[3354.44 --> 3355.72]  So it's kind of a horrible name.
[3356.90 --> 3358.62]  But that's the doctrine,
[3358.84 --> 3359.98]  and we kind of use it,
[3360.04 --> 3360.98]  total depravity.
[3361.68 --> 3363.04]  And this is where people
[3363.04 --> 3364.14]  sometimes think it means
[3364.14 --> 3365.28]  that we are as bad
[3365.28 --> 3366.74]  as we possibly could be.
[3366.74 --> 3369.76]  That actually is not what it means.
[3370.42 --> 3371.46]  What it means is that
[3371.46 --> 3372.86]  we are totally unable
[3372.86 --> 3374.10]  to respond to God
[3374.10 --> 3375.10]  in our natural selves.
[3375.74 --> 3375.88]  Right?
[3376.02 --> 3377.10]  It's impossible.
[3378.16 --> 3379.38]  And that's what Paul is saying here,
[3379.44 --> 3381.10]  that we cannot submit
[3381.10 --> 3382.52]  to God's laws.
[3383.32 --> 3384.78]  And it's not because
[3384.78 --> 3385.96]  God's laws are just
[3385.96 --> 3387.34]  far too demanding,
[3388.22 --> 3389.60]  and he's just expecting of us
[3389.60 --> 3391.12]  things that are just totally unfair
[3391.12 --> 3392.66]  for him to expect of us.
[3392.68 --> 3394.04]  That's not why we can't do it.
[3394.84 --> 3395.66]  That's not the problem.
[3395.66 --> 3397.26]  The problem is that
[3397.26 --> 3399.60]  we are spiritually incapable.
[3401.78 --> 3403.40]  We are spiritually incapable.
[3404.86 --> 3406.44]  So we don't submit to God's law.
[3406.56 --> 3407.76]  We can't do it.
[3408.68 --> 3409.82]  Then the third thing we learn
[3409.82 --> 3410.80]  about those in the flesh
[3410.80 --> 3411.48]  is in verse 8,
[3412.14 --> 3412.84]  where it says,
[3413.62 --> 3414.54]  those who are in the realm
[3414.54 --> 3416.90]  of the flesh cannot please God.
[3418.44 --> 3419.56]  And so, you know,
[3419.64 --> 3421.76]  just by showing up
[3421.76 --> 3423.76]  as part of the human race,
[3424.60 --> 3424.80]  right,
[3424.80 --> 3425.94]  just being born in this world,
[3426.66 --> 3427.96]  you are not pleasing God.
[3428.84 --> 3429.32]  Why?
[3430.14 --> 3432.02]  It's because you are showing up
[3432.02 --> 3434.18]  as somebody who is driven
[3434.18 --> 3436.26]  not by him,
[3436.62 --> 3438.16]  but by self.
[3440.40 --> 3441.02]  You know,
[3441.08 --> 3442.20]  in one respect,
[3442.46 --> 3442.62]  you know,
[3442.68 --> 3444.60]  even though this is a hard word here,
[3444.68 --> 3445.66]  that those in the flesh,
[3445.74 --> 3446.62]  we can't please God,
[3447.00 --> 3448.44]  actually what it suggests
[3448.44 --> 3449.68]  is something pretty remarkable,
[3449.68 --> 3450.92]  if we think about it
[3450.92 --> 3451.56]  in a different way.
[3452.16 --> 3453.54]  Because what it suggests to us
[3453.54 --> 3455.32]  is that God actually desires
[3455.32 --> 3456.26]  to be pleased.
[3457.58 --> 3458.80]  And that's kind of interesting
[3458.80 --> 3459.46]  to think about.
[3460.16 --> 3460.36]  You know,
[3460.44 --> 3462.32]  and don't you want to be pleased?
[3462.82 --> 3463.76]  We all want to be pleased.
[3464.04 --> 3464.52]  That's kind of,
[3464.58 --> 3465.54]  it's nice to be pleased,
[3465.54 --> 3466.22]  right?
[3466.30 --> 3467.58]  It means things are going our way.
[3467.66 --> 3468.22]  We're pleased.
[3468.22 --> 3470.84]  And what we learn about God
[3470.84 --> 3471.78]  is that even though
[3471.78 --> 3473.90]  he is eternal,
[3474.16 --> 3474.48]  infinite,
[3474.62 --> 3476.26]  God is in need of nothing,
[3477.04 --> 3477.30]  right?
[3477.40 --> 3478.52]  God doesn't need anything.
[3478.76 --> 3480.84]  He's full in himself,
[3480.98 --> 3481.94]  perfect in himself.
[3483.94 --> 3485.90]  He doesn't need to be pleased by us,
[3485.94 --> 3486.40]  and yet,
[3486.52 --> 3486.90]  nevertheless,
[3487.42 --> 3489.82]  he desires that we please him.
[3491.68 --> 3494.38]  And the problem with those in the flesh
[3494.38 --> 3495.86]  is that they cannot do
[3495.86 --> 3497.18]  what they were created to do,
[3498.32 --> 3498.54]  right?
[3498.60 --> 3500.02]  And so think about Adam and Eve.
[3500.12 --> 3501.26]  Before they sinned,
[3501.72 --> 3502.66]  they pleased God.
[3503.54 --> 3505.10]  But after they sinned,
[3505.16 --> 3506.84]  they could not please God.
[3508.38 --> 3510.78]  And so this is what we see
[3510.78 --> 3511.90]  that it means
[3511.90 --> 3513.46]  to live according to the flesh.
[3513.50 --> 3515.28]  It's this deep orientation
[3515.28 --> 3517.20]  to just reject God,
[3518.54 --> 3518.76]  right?
[3518.80 --> 3521.82]  To live either really hostile toward him
[3521.82 --> 3523.28]  or indifferently to him.
[3523.30 --> 3523.78]  Either way,
[3523.78 --> 3524.84]  we're not honoring him,
[3524.96 --> 3525.78]  giving him the glory
[3525.78 --> 3526.50]  that is due him.
[3526.64 --> 3528.24]  We don't submit to his laws.
[3528.42 --> 3529.02]  We can't.
[3529.20 --> 3530.44]  And we don't please him.
[3531.92 --> 3532.04]  Okay?
[3532.06 --> 3533.16]  That's just what it means
[3533.16 --> 3534.50]  to live in the flesh.
[3534.92 --> 3535.56]  And again,
[3535.66 --> 3537.42]  this is true of all of us.
[3537.98 --> 3539.36]  The whole human race.
[3540.86 --> 3541.92]  But there's an exception,
[3542.06 --> 3542.40]  isn't there?
[3543.20 --> 3544.32]  There's one exception.
[3545.32 --> 3546.52]  And the one exception,
[3546.70 --> 3547.00]  of course,
[3547.00 --> 3547.36]  is who?
[3548.58 --> 3549.02]  Jesus.
[3550.22 --> 3550.38]  Right?
[3550.38 --> 3551.62]  Jesus is the one person
[3551.62 --> 3552.46]  who was born
[3552.46 --> 3554.08]  born with the absolutely
[3554.08 --> 3555.94]  opposite orientation.
[3557.04 --> 3557.18]  Right?
[3557.24 --> 3558.52]  So instead of having this deep
[3558.52 --> 3559.66]  fundamental orientation
[3559.66 --> 3560.78]  away from God,
[3560.86 --> 3562.24]  which is what we all have,
[3562.94 --> 3564.78]  Jesus' fundamental orientation
[3564.78 --> 3567.18]  was towards God.
[3568.30 --> 3568.84]  Right?
[3568.92 --> 3570.00]  Jesus always lived
[3570.00 --> 3571.10]  a life of worship
[3571.10 --> 3572.20]  of God.
[3572.32 --> 3572.48]  Right?
[3572.48 --> 3574.42]  a life where he deeply
[3574.42 --> 3576.04]  honored God
[3576.04 --> 3577.24]  and glorified him.
[3577.84 --> 3579.06]  He always submitted
[3579.06 --> 3580.06]  to God's laws.
[3580.76 --> 3582.00]  Pleasing God
[3582.00 --> 3582.84]  was
[3582.84 --> 3584.10]  the thing
[3584.10 --> 3584.96]  that motivated
[3584.96 --> 3585.86]  his actions,
[3586.02 --> 3586.82]  his desires,
[3586.94 --> 3587.60]  his decisions.
[3588.98 --> 3589.90]  So now,
[3590.06 --> 3590.98]  here's the question.
[3592.14 --> 3592.50]  What
[3592.50 --> 3593.62]  caused
[3593.62 --> 3594.42]  that
[3594.42 --> 3595.80]  orientation
[3595.80 --> 3596.68]  within Jesus?
[3597.58 --> 3598.66]  What caused
[3598.66 --> 3599.36]  that orientation
[3599.36 --> 3600.02]  within Jesus
[3600.02 --> 3600.42]  to
[3600.42 --> 3601.64]  toward God?
[3602.02 --> 3602.44]  Well,
[3602.52 --> 3603.16]  and you might say,
[3603.28 --> 3603.54]  well,
[3603.80 --> 3604.18]  I mean,
[3604.66 --> 3605.56]  he's Jesus.
[3606.26 --> 3606.52]  Right?
[3606.62 --> 3607.72]  Isn't that obvious?
[3609.08 --> 3609.38]  But,
[3609.66 --> 3610.16]  yes,
[3610.38 --> 3610.86]  but if you
[3610.86 --> 3612.02]  look at Jesus'
[3612.26 --> 3612.70]  life,
[3613.12 --> 3613.96]  it becomes pretty
[3613.96 --> 3614.96]  clear that it was
[3614.96 --> 3616.58]  actually the Holy Spirit
[3616.58 --> 3617.22]  in Jesus
[3617.22 --> 3619.02]  that was giving him
[3619.02 --> 3619.94]  that deep orientation
[3619.94 --> 3620.52]  to God.
[3621.46 --> 3621.78]  And then,
[3621.90 --> 3622.14]  now,
[3623.04 --> 3623.60]  follow me
[3623.60 --> 3624.32]  and check this out.
[3624.42 --> 3624.88]  This is cool.
[3625.96 --> 3627.58]  According to this passage,
[3628.14 --> 3628.92]  what the Holy Spirit
[3628.92 --> 3630.54]  does in the life
[3630.54 --> 3631.08]  of a Christian
[3631.08 --> 3632.86]  is to give
[3632.86 --> 3633.58]  Jesus'
[3633.86 --> 3634.30]  orientation
[3634.30 --> 3635.14]  towards God
[3635.14 --> 3636.22]  to us.
[3637.78 --> 3638.30]  Jesus,
[3638.50 --> 3639.20]  the Holy Spirit,
[3639.58 --> 3640.50]  takes Jesus'
[3640.74 --> 3641.76]  orientation to God
[3641.76 --> 3643.08]  and he bestows it
[3643.08 --> 3643.96]  upon us.
[3644.50 --> 3645.60]  And he plants it
[3645.60 --> 3646.78]  deep within us.
[3648.46 --> 3649.58]  Am I still on?
[3650.54 --> 3651.42]  You lost me.
[3651.52 --> 3652.02]  You just missed
[3652.02 --> 3652.62]  my good point.
[3653.10 --> 3653.90]  I'm just kidding.
[3654.96 --> 3656.08]  But that was important.
[3656.72 --> 3656.86]  Are we,
[3656.98 --> 3657.12]  now,
[3657.12 --> 3657.74]  it's kind of
[3657.74 --> 3658.12]  in and out,
[3658.16 --> 3658.30]  right?
[3659.38 --> 3660.10]  Should I switch
[3660.10 --> 3660.74]  to the hand mic?
[3662.38 --> 3662.92]  We're good?
[3663.12 --> 3663.58]  You hear me?
[3664.66 --> 3665.62]  Don't say I'm not on.
[3666.56 --> 3667.26]  I am on.
[3668.40 --> 3668.84]  All right.
[3669.20 --> 3669.36]  Oh,
[3669.48 --> 3669.64]  hey.
[3670.58 --> 3671.10]  It kind of goes
[3671.10 --> 3671.46]  in and out.
[3671.60 --> 3671.78]  Okay.
[3672.58 --> 3673.04]  That's okay.
[3676.24 --> 3676.50]  Oh,
[3676.70 --> 3677.08]  never mind.
[3677.24 --> 3677.44]  Okay.
[3677.66 --> 3678.54]  Try to make a joke.
[3679.86 --> 3681.04]  Better not to.
[3681.88 --> 3683.06]  Let's look at verse 9.
[3683.06 --> 3683.10]  Verse 9.
[3687.12 --> 3687.92]  Paul,
[3688.10 --> 3688.26]  you know,
[3688.30 --> 3688.88]  we talked about
[3688.88 --> 3689.78]  those who are
[3689.78 --> 3691.54]  in the flesh.
[3691.84 --> 3693.20]  Now Paul shows us
[3693.20 --> 3694.20]  who we are
[3694.20 --> 3695.42]  as those who live
[3695.42 --> 3696.36]  according to the Spirit.
[3696.96 --> 3697.66]  So in verse 9,
[3697.76 --> 3698.14]  he says,
[3698.56 --> 3698.80]  you,
[3699.16 --> 3699.64]  however,
[3700.60 --> 3701.40]  are not in
[3701.40 --> 3702.32]  the realm of the flesh,
[3702.70 --> 3703.30]  but are in
[3703.30 --> 3704.14]  the realm of the Spirit,
[3704.22 --> 3704.90]  if indeed
[3704.90 --> 3706.16]  the Spirit of God
[3706.16 --> 3706.82]  lives in you.
[3707.38 --> 3707.60]  Like,
[3707.68 --> 3707.96]  as in,
[3708.04 --> 3708.76]  as the case,
[3708.84 --> 3709.06]  that,
[3709.14 --> 3709.70]  the Spirit of God
[3709.70 --> 3710.26]  lives in you.
[3710.98 --> 3711.88]  And if anyone
[3711.88 --> 3712.44]  does not have
[3712.44 --> 3713.30]  the Spirit of Christ,
[3713.38 --> 3714.14]  they don't belong
[3714.14 --> 3714.88]  to Christ.
[3714.88 --> 3717.88]  So Paul is telling us
[3717.88 --> 3719.08]  that when you become
[3719.08 --> 3719.78]  a Christian,
[3720.44 --> 3721.76]  you become new.
[3722.74 --> 3723.64]  That's what he's saying.
[3724.56 --> 3725.42]  And kind of in the words
[3725.42 --> 3725.84]  of Jesus,
[3725.96 --> 3726.88]  in John chapter 3,
[3727.52 --> 3728.38]  what does Jesus say?
[3728.88 --> 3729.94]  We are born again.
[3730.72 --> 3730.92]  Right?
[3730.96 --> 3731.72]  You were born wrong
[3731.72 --> 3732.40]  the first time.
[3732.48 --> 3733.70]  You need to have
[3733.70 --> 3735.38]  a whole new birth.
[3736.08 --> 3737.30]  You need to be born again,
[3737.40 --> 3738.10]  born of the Spirit.
[3738.34 --> 3739.14]  The flesh gives birth
[3739.14 --> 3739.62]  to the flesh.
[3739.62 --> 3740.72]  The Spirit gives birth
[3740.72 --> 3741.40]  to the Spirit.
[3742.72 --> 3742.86]  Right?
[3742.92 --> 3743.74]  And so the Holy Spirit
[3743.74 --> 3744.44]  then gives us
[3744.44 --> 3744.94]  this deep,
[3745.16 --> 3746.24]  fundamental orientation
[3746.24 --> 3748.20]  towards God now.
[3748.60 --> 3749.48]  So that God,
[3749.62 --> 3750.72]  above all else,
[3750.78 --> 3751.78]  is what motivates
[3751.78 --> 3752.58]  our desires
[3752.58 --> 3753.22]  and our decisions
[3753.22 --> 3754.00]  and our actions.
[3755.92 --> 3756.68]  And here,
[3756.84 --> 3757.20]  we see,
[3757.38 --> 3757.76]  you know,
[3759.14 --> 3759.92]  we are given
[3759.92 --> 3761.10]  this very interesting name
[3761.10 --> 3761.84]  for the Holy Spirit.
[3762.90 --> 3763.56]  He is called
[3763.56 --> 3766.36]  the Spirit of Christ.
[3766.82 --> 3767.44]  Do you notice that?
[3767.48 --> 3768.52]  The Spirit of Christ.
[3768.52 --> 3769.68]  It says the Spirit of God,
[3769.76 --> 3770.54]  the Spirit of Christ.
[3771.08 --> 3771.42]  Now,
[3771.50 --> 3772.26]  why would he be called
[3772.26 --> 3773.14]  the Spirit of Christ?
[3774.00 --> 3774.52]  Well,
[3774.54 --> 3775.62]  it's because the Holy Spirit
[3775.62 --> 3776.74]  doesn't come,
[3776.82 --> 3777.08]  really,
[3777.22 --> 3779.02]  in his own name
[3779.02 --> 3780.58]  for his own purposes.
[3781.22 --> 3781.52]  Right?
[3781.56 --> 3782.26]  He comes
[3782.26 --> 3783.88]  to glorify Christ
[3783.88 --> 3784.70]  in your heart.
[3785.46 --> 3785.64]  Right?
[3785.66 --> 3786.78]  He comes to glorify Christ
[3786.78 --> 3787.74]  in your life
[3787.74 --> 3789.22]  and has you then
[3789.22 --> 3790.84]  to think about Christ's work
[3790.84 --> 3792.20]  and who Christ is
[3792.20 --> 3792.94]  and what it means
[3792.94 --> 3793.68]  to follow him.
[3793.88 --> 3795.16]  That's what the Holy Spirit does.
[3796.14 --> 3797.36]  And because the Holy Spirit
[3797.36 --> 3798.12]  lives in you,
[3799.06 --> 3800.16]  that word live,
[3800.24 --> 3800.66]  it's not,
[3800.92 --> 3801.44]  it doesn't mean
[3801.44 --> 3802.52]  an occasional visitor.
[3802.52 --> 3803.42]  He's not a guest
[3803.42 --> 3804.46]  who kind of shows up
[3804.46 --> 3804.96]  and leaves.
[3805.60 --> 3807.68]  He is a permanent resident
[3807.68 --> 3809.66]  who will never leave you.
[3811.24 --> 3811.62]  Okay?
[3811.68 --> 3812.70]  So the Spirit of Christ
[3812.70 --> 3813.50]  lives in you
[3813.50 --> 3814.66]  and he gives you now
[3814.66 --> 3816.02]  a whole new orientation
[3816.02 --> 3816.90]  to Christ
[3817.74 --> 3818.44]  and his kingdom
[3818.44 --> 3819.70]  and all that that means.
[3822.28 --> 3823.00]  And so,
[3823.36 --> 3823.74]  you know,
[3823.84 --> 3824.22]  Paul,
[3824.46 --> 3825.48]  if you've been with us
[3825.48 --> 3826.42]  the last few weeks
[3826.42 --> 3827.48]  or you may have just noticed
[3827.48 --> 3829.42]  that Romans chapter 8,
[3829.50 --> 3831.14]  it begins with these words,
[3831.66 --> 3832.90]  there is now
[3832.90 --> 3834.38]  no condemnation
[3834.38 --> 3835.18]  for those who are
[3835.18 --> 3835.98]  in Christ Jesus.
[3836.74 --> 3837.02]  Right?
[3837.06 --> 3837.90]  And we talked a lot
[3837.90 --> 3838.34]  about that
[3838.34 --> 3839.24]  and that is amazing.
[3840.10 --> 3841.74]  But even as amazing
[3841.74 --> 3842.66]  as that is
[3842.66 --> 3843.92]  that there is no condemnation
[3843.92 --> 3844.72]  in Christ Jesus,
[3845.54 --> 3846.80]  God has even more
[3846.80 --> 3847.52]  for us
[3847.52 --> 3848.58]  than not being condemned.
[3850.06 --> 3850.58]  Right?
[3850.64 --> 3851.46]  Because God wants
[3851.46 --> 3852.58]  more for us
[3852.58 --> 3853.18]  than simply
[3853.18 --> 3853.98]  the absence
[3853.98 --> 3854.88]  of condemnation.
[3854.88 --> 3856.88]  He wants the presence
[3856.88 --> 3858.44]  in our lives
[3858.44 --> 3860.18]  of his heart
[3860.18 --> 3862.32]  and of his mindset.
[3863.22 --> 3864.02]  He's creating
[3864.02 --> 3865.34]  a people for himself.
[3867.80 --> 3868.76]  And so God's plan
[3868.76 --> 3869.72]  and God's design
[3869.72 --> 3870.48]  was never just
[3870.48 --> 3871.26]  to create a group
[3871.26 --> 3872.56]  of non-condemned people
[3872.56 --> 3873.38]  called Christians
[3873.38 --> 3875.60]  but his plan,
[3875.74 --> 3876.18]  his design,
[3876.28 --> 3876.86]  his heart
[3876.86 --> 3878.86]  is to have a people
[3878.86 --> 3880.40]  who walk in his ways.
[3881.08 --> 3881.20]  Right?
[3881.26 --> 3882.30]  And who follow him
[3882.30 --> 3883.60]  and who please him.
[3884.88 --> 3886.34]  And so God has given us
[3886.34 --> 3887.06]  his Holy Spirit.
[3887.90 --> 3888.52]  He's given us
[3888.52 --> 3889.34]  the orientation
[3889.34 --> 3890.84]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3890.84 --> 3892.44]  so that we now live
[3892.44 --> 3894.00]  according to the Spirit.
[3894.82 --> 3895.94]  We no longer live
[3895.94 --> 3896.84]  according to the flesh.
[3896.90 --> 3897.60]  And so if you are
[3897.60 --> 3898.66]  a believer in Jesus Christ
[3898.66 --> 3899.86]  that is who you are now.
[3900.80 --> 3901.46]  That is now
[3901.46 --> 3902.26]  what defines you.
[3904.04 --> 3904.78]  Okay, so now
[3904.78 --> 3905.92]  what application
[3905.92 --> 3907.12]  can we take from this?
[3908.14 --> 3908.82]  Well the first,
[3908.96 --> 3909.52]  there's two things
[3909.52 --> 3910.02]  I want to say.
[3910.10 --> 3910.92]  The first is this,
[3911.56 --> 3913.24]  that we kind of
[3913.24 --> 3913.88]  have a problem
[3913.88 --> 3914.92]  when we come to this.
[3914.94 --> 3915.54]  As Christians,
[3916.58 --> 3917.40]  the problem that
[3917.40 --> 3918.54]  so many of us have
[3918.54 --> 3919.32]  who are Christians
[3919.32 --> 3920.66]  is we tend to think,
[3921.24 --> 3922.56]  well I just can't see
[3922.56 --> 3923.82]  this being true of me.
[3925.14 --> 3925.54]  Right?
[3925.62 --> 3927.34]  I still struggle with sin
[3927.34 --> 3929.28]  and so I must be
[3929.28 --> 3929.96]  of the flesh.
[3930.76 --> 3931.00]  Right?
[3931.14 --> 3932.24]  Sometimes we think that.
[3933.02 --> 3933.78]  Or, well,
[3933.88 --> 3934.62]  on the other hand,
[3934.70 --> 3935.62]  sometimes the people
[3935.62 --> 3936.66]  who are of the flesh
[3936.66 --> 3937.42]  think they're of the Spirit.
[3938.48 --> 3939.24]  But for Christians,
[3939.34 --> 3940.26]  we kind of have
[3940.26 --> 3941.06]  the tendency to think,
[3941.16 --> 3942.00]  oh that's not us.
[3942.00 --> 3942.22]  You know,
[3942.24 --> 3942.78]  we kind of are
[3942.78 --> 3943.92]  self-deprecating
[3943.92 --> 3945.06]  and oh I'm not
[3945.06 --> 3945.76]  spiritual,
[3945.90 --> 3946.78]  I must be of the flesh.
[3947.68 --> 3948.76]  Now if that is you
[3948.76 --> 3949.40]  this morning,
[3949.40 --> 3950.60]  I'm happy to tell you
[3950.60 --> 3951.20]  that you're wrong.
[3951.86 --> 3951.98]  Ha!
[3952.90 --> 3953.92]  I'm happy to tell you
[3953.92 --> 3954.88]  that you are mistaken.
[3955.62 --> 3956.02]  Right?
[3956.10 --> 3957.02]  Because if you have
[3957.02 --> 3957.68]  put your faith
[3957.68 --> 3958.42]  in Jesus Christ,
[3958.56 --> 3959.18]  Paul is saying
[3959.18 --> 3960.36]  that you really
[3960.36 --> 3961.38]  have
[3961.38 --> 3962.78]  been given
[3962.78 --> 3963.44]  a new heart.
[3964.88 --> 3965.10]  Right?
[3965.10 --> 3965.92]  That you really
[3965.92 --> 3966.94]  have been
[3966.94 --> 3967.96]  made new
[3967.96 --> 3969.28]  by the Holy Spirit.
[3969.28 --> 3970.36]  that you have now
[3970.36 --> 3971.08]  this new
[3971.08 --> 3972.30]  fundamental
[3972.30 --> 3973.28]  deep orientation
[3973.28 --> 3974.30]  in your heart.
[3975.86 --> 3976.26]  Yes,
[3976.60 --> 3977.78]  there are still
[3977.78 --> 3978.86]  ongoing failures.
[3979.92 --> 3981.04]  But you are
[3981.04 --> 3982.04]  someone in whom
[3982.04 --> 3982.84]  the Spirit of God
[3982.84 --> 3983.44]  now lives.
[3984.38 --> 3985.26]  And even though
[3985.26 --> 3985.70]  that is now
[3985.70 --> 3986.40]  a process
[3986.40 --> 3988.32]  to let the Spirit
[3988.32 --> 3989.08]  then change
[3989.08 --> 3989.92]  and transform us
[3989.92 --> 3990.52]  so that
[3990.52 --> 3992.18]  we live in
[3992.18 --> 3992.60]  accordance
[3992.60 --> 3993.56]  with the Spirit.
[3994.20 --> 3995.14]  And that's a process.
[3995.82 --> 3997.00]  But the one,
[3997.22 --> 3998.06]  here's one way
[3998.06 --> 3998.64]  you know
[3998.64 --> 3999.54]  that you're alive
[3999.54 --> 4000.24]  in the Spirit
[4000.24 --> 4002.30]  is that you are
[4002.30 --> 4003.10]  now somebody
[4003.10 --> 4004.78]  who wants
[4004.78 --> 4005.70]  to live for Jesus.
[4006.54 --> 4007.46]  You want to live
[4007.46 --> 4007.96]  for Jesus.
[4008.48 --> 4008.62]  Right?
[4008.66 --> 4009.32]  You want to worship
[4009.32 --> 4010.26]  and honor God.
[4010.36 --> 4011.14]  You want to obey
[4011.14 --> 4011.70]  His laws.
[4012.28 --> 4013.16]  It is your greatest
[4013.16 --> 4014.30]  desire now
[4014.30 --> 4015.12]  to please Him.
[4016.30 --> 4017.06]  And so I heard
[4017.06 --> 4017.84]  it put this way.
[4018.64 --> 4019.50]  If there was
[4019.50 --> 4020.22]  a button
[4020.22 --> 4022.10]  in the world,
[4022.20 --> 4022.78]  in the universe,
[4023.00 --> 4024.10]  that you could press,
[4024.68 --> 4025.42]  that would mean
[4025.42 --> 4026.14]  you would never
[4026.14 --> 4026.84]  sin again.
[4026.84 --> 4029.78]  wouldn't you love
[4029.78 --> 4031.00]  to get your hands
[4031.00 --> 4031.54]  on that button
[4031.54 --> 4033.58]  and to press it
[4033.58 --> 4035.42]  right now?
[4039.50 --> 4040.40]  And if that is
[4040.40 --> 4041.08]  true of you,
[4041.30 --> 4041.92]  that if you're just
[4041.92 --> 4042.30]  like, yeah,
[4042.42 --> 4043.64]  immediately I could
[4043.64 --> 4044.16]  just be done
[4044.16 --> 4045.16]  with sin in my life,
[4045.30 --> 4045.86]  if that's your
[4045.86 --> 4047.00]  actual desire,
[4047.64 --> 4048.68]  that sensitivity
[4048.68 --> 4049.64]  to the reality
[4049.64 --> 4050.72]  of sin in your life
[4050.72 --> 4052.98]  is evidence
[4052.98 --> 4053.76]  that the Holy Spirit
[4053.76 --> 4054.24]  is working
[4054.24 --> 4054.90]  inside of you.
[4054.90 --> 4057.72]  And friends,
[4057.88 --> 4058.80]  the presence
[4058.80 --> 4059.52]  of the Spirit
[4059.52 --> 4060.14]  in your life
[4060.14 --> 4061.00]  doing that work,
[4061.28 --> 4062.16]  that should fill you
[4062.16 --> 4062.80]  with confidence
[4062.80 --> 4063.44]  before God.
[4065.32 --> 4065.52]  Right?
[4065.64 --> 4066.48]  And the Apostle Paul
[4066.48 --> 4067.42]  says in Philippians
[4067.42 --> 4068.72]  that he who began
[4068.72 --> 4069.78]  a good work in you
[4069.78 --> 4070.46]  is faithful
[4070.46 --> 4071.52]  to bring it
[4071.52 --> 4072.14]  to completion
[4072.14 --> 4073.00]  on the day
[4073.00 --> 4074.40]  of Christ Jesus.
[4075.58 --> 4075.72]  Okay,
[4075.72 --> 4076.32]  so that's the first thing.
[4076.36 --> 4077.12]  We can have confidence
[4077.12 --> 4077.82]  before God.
[4079.02 --> 4079.74]  Acknowledging that,
[4079.84 --> 4079.94]  yeah,
[4080.06 --> 4081.72]  we still fail
[4081.72 --> 4082.64]  and stumble sometimes,
[4082.64 --> 4083.70]  but the fact is
[4083.70 --> 4084.62]  that you have
[4084.62 --> 4085.42]  the Spirit of God
[4085.42 --> 4085.82]  in you.
[4086.12 --> 4086.72]  And that leads us
[4086.72 --> 4087.26]  to the second
[4087.26 --> 4088.52]  final point of application,
[4089.00 --> 4089.62]  which is now
[4089.62 --> 4090.48]  that you must act
[4090.48 --> 4090.92]  in accordance
[4090.92 --> 4091.52]  with the Spirit.
[4092.48 --> 4092.60]  Okay,
[4092.60 --> 4093.62]  you must act now,
[4093.78 --> 4094.60]  live in accordance
[4094.60 --> 4095.16]  with the Spirit.
[4096.58 --> 4096.80]  Right?
[4096.86 --> 4097.38]  And so we say,
[4097.54 --> 4097.72]  okay,
[4097.82 --> 4098.12]  God,
[4098.36 --> 4098.92]  you have given me
[4098.92 --> 4099.52]  a new nature
[4099.52 --> 4101.16]  that is now oriented
[4101.16 --> 4101.92]  toward you.
[4103.16 --> 4103.88]  But now,
[4104.12 --> 4104.80]  even though
[4104.80 --> 4105.52]  as a Christian
[4105.52 --> 4106.40]  we have the Spirit
[4106.40 --> 4108.82]  and even now
[4108.82 --> 4109.82]  our minds
[4109.82 --> 4110.34]  might be set
[4110.34 --> 4110.94]  on the Spirit,
[4111.30 --> 4113.00]  still from time to time
[4113.00 --> 4114.76]  we are still tempted
[4114.76 --> 4116.74]  by fleshly thoughts
[4116.74 --> 4118.98]  that come into our mind
[4118.98 --> 4119.50]  all the time.
[4120.02 --> 4120.14]  Right?
[4120.18 --> 4121.14]  And so we must admit that.
[4121.30 --> 4122.02]  We are still tempted
[4122.02 --> 4123.66]  by fleshly thoughts,
[4123.80 --> 4124.34]  setting our mind
[4124.34 --> 4126.42]  on fleshly things
[4126.42 --> 4127.72]  to use Paul's words.
[4128.82 --> 4130.10]  And we see an example
[4130.10 --> 4131.26]  of that in Scripture.
[4132.14 --> 4132.92]  There's this time
[4132.92 --> 4133.58]  when Jesus
[4133.58 --> 4134.98]  is speaking to Peter.
[4135.98 --> 4136.26]  Right?
[4136.26 --> 4137.76]  And he's saying to Peter,
[4137.90 --> 4138.00]  look,
[4138.04 --> 4138.90]  this is what it means
[4138.90 --> 4140.54]  that I am the Messiah.
[4140.72 --> 4141.92]  I have to go to Jerusalem.
[4142.22 --> 4143.40]  And I am going to suffer
[4143.40 --> 4144.08]  and die.
[4144.14 --> 4144.94]  And on the third day
[4144.94 --> 4145.82]  I'm going to rise again.
[4147.26 --> 4148.96]  And Peter is not on board
[4148.96 --> 4150.54]  with that plan.
[4151.22 --> 4151.86]  And so what does Peter
[4151.86 --> 4152.72]  say to Jesus?
[4153.06 --> 4154.76]  In Matthew 16, 23,
[4155.68 --> 4156.54]  Jesus says,
[4157.14 --> 4157.52]  so, you know,
[4157.58 --> 4158.32]  Peter's not on board.
[4158.68 --> 4159.96]  Jesus says to Peter,
[4159.96 --> 4162.04]  you are not setting
[4162.04 --> 4163.26]  your mind
[4163.26 --> 4165.30]  on the things of God,
[4165.30 --> 4167.30]  but on the things
[4167.30 --> 4168.00]  of man.
[4169.52 --> 4170.14]  And isn't that
[4170.14 --> 4171.12]  interesting language?
[4172.18 --> 4172.32]  Right?
[4172.38 --> 4172.64]  You see,
[4172.74 --> 4173.98]  so Peter was at that point,
[4174.02 --> 4175.40]  he was acting as one
[4175.40 --> 4177.18]  who is in the flesh.
[4178.08 --> 4179.74]  And Jesus rebukes Peter
[4179.74 --> 4180.68]  because Peter is not
[4180.68 --> 4181.56]  setting his mind
[4181.56 --> 4182.44]  on the things of God.
[4183.64 --> 4185.68]  And so Jesus expects Peter
[4185.68 --> 4187.42]  to actually set his mind
[4187.42 --> 4188.40]  in a certain direction.
[4189.04 --> 4190.80]  As a follower of Jesus,
[4191.36 --> 4192.56]  he has a duty
[4192.56 --> 4193.66]  to set his mind
[4193.66 --> 4194.72]  on the things of God.
[4196.16 --> 4197.32]  And so for those of us
[4197.32 --> 4198.28]  who follow Jesus,
[4198.66 --> 4199.76]  we must also
[4199.76 --> 4201.90]  set our minds.
[4201.96 --> 4202.82]  It's like an action
[4202.82 --> 4203.44]  that we do.
[4203.52 --> 4204.74]  We must set our minds
[4204.74 --> 4205.80]  on the things of God.
[4206.14 --> 4206.86]  And it's not something
[4206.86 --> 4207.92]  where we can say,
[4208.56 --> 4208.94]  oh, well,
[4209.00 --> 4210.50]  God will just do it for me.
[4211.70 --> 4212.08]  Okay?
[4212.12 --> 4213.82]  We are active in this.
[4214.56 --> 4215.24]  We have to,
[4215.84 --> 4217.20]  it's something that we must do,
[4217.20 --> 4217.72]  of course,
[4217.78 --> 4218.58]  with the Spirit's help.
[4218.58 --> 4221.12]  And I think one of the
[4221.12 --> 4221.86]  clearest examples
[4221.86 --> 4223.04]  of what this means
[4223.04 --> 4224.16]  comes from
[4224.16 --> 4225.84]  Philippians 4, verse 8.
[4226.62 --> 4228.14]  So notice what Paul says.
[4229.16 --> 4230.80]  He's giving these exhortations
[4230.80 --> 4231.38]  to the church.
[4231.46 --> 4231.72]  He says,
[4232.10 --> 4233.14]  finally, brothers and sisters,
[4234.26 --> 4235.26]  whatever is true,
[4236.30 --> 4237.30]  whatever is noble,
[4237.72 --> 4238.66]  whatever is right,
[4239.04 --> 4239.86]  whatever is pure,
[4240.00 --> 4240.90]  whatever is lovely,
[4241.06 --> 4242.18]  whatever is admirable,
[4242.50 --> 4243.70]  if anything is excellent
[4243.70 --> 4244.72]  or praiseworthy,
[4244.84 --> 4245.30]  do what?
[4246.68 --> 4248.16]  Think about such things.
[4249.12 --> 4250.30]  Set your mind
[4250.30 --> 4252.50]  on such things.
[4253.68 --> 4255.24]  And so we are to set our minds
[4255.24 --> 4257.08]  on things that are worthy of praise,
[4257.52 --> 4258.46]  that are excellent,
[4258.64 --> 4259.30]  that are lovely,
[4259.42 --> 4260.16]  that are true.
[4261.68 --> 4262.74]  And so you and I,
[4262.80 --> 4264.92]  we have this kind of a duty
[4264.92 --> 4266.10]  as a Christian
[4266.10 --> 4267.66]  to set on our minds
[4267.66 --> 4268.90]  on the things of the Spirit
[4268.90 --> 4271.00]  because you belong to Christ
[4271.00 --> 4273.14]  and because it brings life
[4273.14 --> 4273.72]  and peace
[4273.72 --> 4275.10]  into your life.
[4276.94 --> 4277.32]  And friends,
[4277.32 --> 4279.50]  that is God's wonderful grace
[4279.50 --> 4280.00]  to us.
[4280.48 --> 4281.36]  This is his grace.
[4281.48 --> 4281.76]  Remember,
[4281.96 --> 4283.58]  we're exploring the depths
[4283.58 --> 4284.80]  of the grace of God
[4284.80 --> 4287.78]  in that this is a God
[4287.78 --> 4289.46]  who has made us new.
[4290.24 --> 4290.98]  He is a God
[4290.98 --> 4292.98]  who declares us righteous
[4292.98 --> 4294.10]  in his sight.
[4294.68 --> 4295.78]  And he is a God
[4295.78 --> 4296.84]  who is now at work
[4296.84 --> 4297.80]  in our lives
[4297.80 --> 4298.64]  to help us,
[4298.84 --> 4299.68]  by the Spirit,
[4300.18 --> 4301.32]  set our minds
[4301.32 --> 4302.46]  on the things of Christ
[4302.46 --> 4303.24]  and of Christ's kingdom.
[4304.40 --> 4304.96]  And so let's pray
[4304.96 --> 4305.98]  that God would help us do that.
[4306.26 --> 4306.84]  Let's pray together.
[4307.32 --> 4310.44]  So Father,
[4310.58 --> 4311.88]  we come before you
[4311.88 --> 4313.28]  and we pray first of all
[4313.28 --> 4315.34]  that you would help us
[4315.34 --> 4316.20]  to see ourselves
[4316.20 --> 4317.98]  as we truly are.
[4318.44 --> 4319.86]  And for some of us here
[4319.86 --> 4320.74]  this morning
[4320.74 --> 4321.90]  who are still
[4321.90 --> 4323.54]  of the flesh,
[4323.66 --> 4323.78]  Lord,
[4323.84 --> 4325.42]  would you cause them
[4325.42 --> 4326.30]  to be born again
[4326.30 --> 4328.22]  through faith in you?
[4328.88 --> 4330.00]  For those of us,
[4330.32 --> 4330.52]  Lord,
[4330.62 --> 4332.30]  who know Jesus,
[4332.46 --> 4333.30]  help us to know
[4333.30 --> 4334.72]  that we really are people
[4334.72 --> 4335.60]  who are alive
[4335.60 --> 4336.30]  by the Spirit,
[4336.94 --> 4337.70]  people who really
[4337.70 --> 4339.12]  do belong to you.
[4340.52 --> 4340.92]  And Father,
[4340.98 --> 4341.48]  we thank you
[4341.48 --> 4342.42]  for being so gracious
[4342.42 --> 4343.58]  as to not merely
[4343.58 --> 4344.80]  blot out our sins
[4344.80 --> 4345.44]  and to remove
[4345.44 --> 4346.26]  our condemnation,
[4346.56 --> 4346.92]  but Lord,
[4346.98 --> 4348.18]  to give us the Spirit
[4348.18 --> 4349.76]  to help us
[4349.76 --> 4350.76]  to live in a way
[4350.76 --> 4352.12]  that is pleasing to you.
[4353.48 --> 4354.06]  And Lord,
[4354.12 --> 4355.36]  you are pleased with us
[4355.36 --> 4357.22]  because of Christ in us.
[4357.98 --> 4358.46]  And Lord,
[4358.52 --> 4359.02]  would it be
[4359.02 --> 4360.12]  our greatest desire
[4360.12 --> 4361.52]  to become more and more
[4361.52 --> 4363.54]  like our Lord Jesus Christ?
[4363.82 --> 4364.46]  And would you do
[4364.46 --> 4365.32]  that work in us,
[4365.44 --> 4365.92]  we pray.
[4366.46 --> 4367.28]  And we pray in his
[4367.28 --> 4367.86]  wonderful name.
[4368.22 --> 4368.50]  Amen.
[4371.14 --> 4372.12]  Let's all stand together
[4372.12 --> 4372.98]  and we'll sing
[4372.98 --> 4373.76]  our song of response.
[4373.76 --> 4398.08]  How great the plasm that we retreat us
[4398.08 --> 4404.08]  How high the mountains I could not climb
[4404.08 --> 4410.08]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[4410.08 --> 4417.08]  And spoke your name into the land
[4417.08 --> 4423.08]  Through the darkness your loving kindness
[4423.08 --> 4429.08]  Torn through the shadows of my soul
[4429.08 --> 4436.08]  The heart is finished, the end is written
[4436.08 --> 4442.08]  Jesus Christ, my living heart
[4442.08 --> 4452.08]  Who would imagine so great our hearts here
[4452.08 --> 4458.08]  What heart would fathom such boundless grace
[4458.08 --> 4464.08]  And all the ages came down from glory
[4464.08 --> 4470.08]  To where I sin and where I sin
[4470.08 --> 4476.08]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
[4476.08 --> 4482.08]  The King of kings calls me his own
[4482.08 --> 4489.08]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever
[4489.08 --> 4495.08]  Jesus Christ, my living heart
[4495.08 --> 4503.08]  Hallelujah, praise the one who sent me free
[4503.08 --> 4509.08]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[4509.08 --> 4512.08]  You have broken every chain
[4512.08 --> 4515.08]  There's salvation in your name
[4515.08 --> 4521.08]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4521.08 --> 4524.08]  Then came the morning
[4524.08 --> 4525.08]  And the morning
[4525.08 --> 4527.08]  Alleluia, praise the one who sent me free
[4527.08 --> 4532.08]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[4532.08 --> 4534.08]  You have broken every chain
[4534.08 --> 4538.08]  There's salvation in your name
[4538.08 --> 4542.08]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[4542.08 --> 4552.08]  Amen
[4552.08 --> 4553.08]  And the morning
[4553.08 --> 4555.08]  Then came the morning
[4555.08 --> 4557.08]  That sealed the promise
[4557.08 --> 4558.08]  The merry party
[4558.08 --> 4560.08]  Began to breathe
[4560.08 --> 4563.08]  The water's silenced
[4563.08 --> 4564.08]  The roaring lion
[4564.08 --> 4569.08]  Take care of the grave
[4569.08 --> 4572.38]  has no pain on me.
[4574.38 --> 4579.22]  The morning that sealed the promise,
[4579.22 --> 4585.52]  the very body began to leave.
[4585.90 --> 4591.22]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[4591.22 --> 4597.26]  did bear thy grave, has no pain on me.
[4597.26 --> 4602.82]  Jesus, yours is the victory.
[4606.84 --> 4610.84]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[4612.94 --> 4616.82]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[4617.24 --> 4619.84]  You have broken every tear,
[4620.22 --> 4622.76]  your salvation in your name.
[4622.76 --> 4628.48]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[4630.94 --> 4634.84]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[4636.90 --> 4640.74]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[4641.14 --> 4643.32]  You have broken every tear,
[4644.20 --> 4646.72]  your salvation in your name.
[4646.72 --> 4651.72]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[4651.72 --> 4658.84]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[4659.34 --> 4665.10]  Hallelujah, my living hope.
[4665.10 --> 4669.72]  You may be seated.
[4669.72 --> 4669.74]  You may be seated.
[4678.62 --> 4680.02]  Is this working?
[4681.24 --> 4682.66]  Good morning, everyone.
[4684.12 --> 4689.14]  Today we're privileged to have the president of Life Water Canada,
[4689.14 --> 4693.38]  Linda Gerals, present more information about the mission
[4693.38 --> 4696.86]  that Ladner CRC has supported for several years.
[4697.48 --> 4699.80]  She's traveling across Canada,
[4700.18 --> 4701.88]  sharing with different congregations
[4701.88 --> 4704.14]  about their work in Africa and Haiti.
[4704.44 --> 4705.32]  So welcome, Linda.
[4705.32 --> 4715.40]  Thank you.
[4719.14 --> 4721.54]  I'm so short.
[4722.44 --> 4724.02]  Just standing tiptoes so you can see me.
[4724.86 --> 4729.10]  Thank you so much for accommodating me in this time.
[4729.20 --> 4731.44]  I know it's not the offering being taken up today,
[4731.56 --> 4735.08]  but I do have some incredible, affirming,
[4735.20 --> 4736.50]  and encouraging words to share
[4736.50 --> 4738.16]  because you have supported Life Water
[4738.16 --> 4742.10]  as was spoken many years ago for many years.
[4742.10 --> 4744.84]  I am on a journey.
[4745.40 --> 4749.50]  As you are journeying towards 75th anniversary for your church,
[4749.98 --> 4753.14]  we are celebrating 30 years of ministry,
[4753.40 --> 4755.76]  30 years of providing water and sanitation
[4755.76 --> 4758.16]  and hope to communities overseas.
[4758.98 --> 4761.30]  The first well was drilled in 1995,
[4762.24 --> 4767.26]  and we are working towards the 30 years
[4767.26 --> 4770.94]  when Life Water Canada actually became incorporated
[4770.94 --> 4772.34]  as a Canadian charity.
[4773.42 --> 4775.94]  You know, my husband and a friend, Glenn Strong,
[4776.06 --> 4777.36]  started Life Water.
[4777.52 --> 4779.78]  It really came out of a nasty diagnosis,
[4780.02 --> 4781.76]  and sometimes I think maybe some of you
[4781.76 --> 4784.08]  have come to that moment where, you know,
[4784.08 --> 4785.38]  life all of a sudden at the,
[4785.76 --> 4788.44]  just a flip of a switch changed on you.
[4788.56 --> 4790.04]  It might be a death of a spouse.
[4790.20 --> 4791.32]  It might be, you know,
[4791.48 --> 4794.50]  the diagnosis of having some sort of a disease
[4794.50 --> 4796.92]  that will change the course of your life,
[4797.02 --> 4799.94]  and you can take two different paths.
[4800.12 --> 4801.94]  You know, we're talking about changes today,
[4802.02 --> 4803.06]  you know, and choices.
[4803.48 --> 4805.48]  You can choose to let it rule you,
[4805.54 --> 4806.92]  or you can choose to overcome
[4806.92 --> 4810.62]  and let God use that
[4810.62 --> 4814.18]  to allow you to do his will.
[4814.70 --> 4816.60]  And Jim had a struggle
[4816.60 --> 4819.18]  because he was told he was going to go blind
[4819.18 --> 4821.12]  at an early age,
[4821.12 --> 4823.96]  and his choice was
[4823.96 --> 4828.28]  to accentuate his life plan,
[4828.40 --> 4829.76]  which was to give back to the world
[4829.76 --> 4830.58]  when he retired,
[4831.10 --> 4833.40]  to bring it forward into the now.
[4834.22 --> 4836.68]  He couldn't depend on being able
[4836.68 --> 4839.68]  to do what he wanted in his life plan
[4839.68 --> 4841.68]  because he may have no sight.
[4842.30 --> 4844.20]  And so Life Water really was birthed
[4844.20 --> 4845.94]  out of that unfortunate diagnosis.
[4846.56 --> 4848.42]  He passed away five years ago suddenly,
[4848.42 --> 4856.48]  and I have been with him then for 20 years,
[4856.64 --> 4858.82]  so Life Water was as much mine as his.
[4859.48 --> 4863.44]  And really, the basic understanding
[4863.44 --> 4868.02]  and motivating initiative behind what we do
[4868.02 --> 4869.58]  is that it's not right
[4869.58 --> 4870.94]  that where you are born
[4870.94 --> 4872.50]  should determine whether you live or die.
[4873.02 --> 4874.90]  The people overseas where we work,
[4875.50 --> 4877.36]  the infant death rate is very high.
[4877.36 --> 4878.70]  If you're born here in Canada,
[4878.70 --> 4879.62]  it's not the case.
[4879.82 --> 4881.76]  There's, you know, you, you,
[4882.06 --> 4883.82]  here's an example.
[4884.90 --> 4886.88]  I was teaching a workshop
[4886.88 --> 4888.80]  for health and hygiene
[4888.80 --> 4890.56]  in the early days, 2004,
[4891.30 --> 4892.04]  in Liberia.
[4892.20 --> 4894.02]  I had a bunch of men and women in the class,
[4894.58 --> 4896.44]  and the third,
[4896.62 --> 4898.24]  I was just, simple things like,
[4898.38 --> 4899.66]  you know, how do you get sick?
[4899.84 --> 4900.78]  Why do you get sick?
[4900.82 --> 4902.18]  How can you stop getting sick?
[4902.22 --> 4903.02]  If you do get sick,
[4903.08 --> 4903.98]  what do you do about it?
[4903.98 --> 4906.22]  Very basic.
[4906.78 --> 4909.40]  And I noticed in the third day of the workshop
[4909.40 --> 4911.84]  an elderly lady in the back corner weeping.
[4912.34 --> 4913.12]  I'm going to understand,
[4913.50 --> 4915.02]  you know, maybe I'd stepped on,
[4915.06 --> 4916.18]  it was my first trip to Africa,
[4916.32 --> 4918.74]  I thought maybe I had stepped on some taboo toes,
[4918.82 --> 4919.58]  I wasn't sure.
[4920.16 --> 4923.12]  And I went home that evening with her daughter, Fatou,
[4923.20 --> 4924.34]  and I asked Fatou,
[4924.50 --> 4925.90]  how come Elizabeth was weeping,
[4926.08 --> 4928.08]  you know, over what we were talking?
[4928.08 --> 4930.90]  And she explained to me that in her tribe
[4930.90 --> 4933.56]  it was customary not to name an infant
[4933.56 --> 4935.64]  until they were a month old
[4935.64 --> 4939.94]  because babies weren't living always.
[4940.60 --> 4942.80]  And at that moment,
[4942.88 --> 4944.18]  when the baby became a month,
[4944.26 --> 4946.50]  they figured that that child had a good opportunity
[4947.12 --> 4950.08]  to be able to live a longer life.
[4950.46 --> 4952.30]  And so they would have a ceremony,
[4952.50 --> 4953.42]  they would name the infant,
[4953.42 --> 4956.60]  and then the Oma or the Opa would give the baby
[4956.60 --> 4958.08]  its first drink of water
[4958.08 --> 4959.78]  because water is life.
[4961.38 --> 4964.04]  That water was contaminated.
[4965.62 --> 4968.62]  And Elizabeth had connected all of those dots
[4968.62 --> 4970.94]  that had been given to her over the three-day workshop
[4970.94 --> 4973.84]  and realized that she had been instrumental
[4973.84 --> 4976.56]  in killing not one but three of her grandbabies.
[4976.56 --> 4981.18]  What a horrible revelation.
[4982.52 --> 4984.84]  I was worried about her a little bit,
[4985.18 --> 4986.76]  and next year when I went back,
[4986.82 --> 4988.16]  I looked her up and I, you know,
[4988.20 --> 4989.10]  see how she was doing,
[4989.24 --> 4990.82]  and she was just radiant with joy
[4990.82 --> 4993.50]  because she'd taken that knowledge,
[4993.76 --> 4997.24]  she'd taken that moment of, you know,
[4997.58 --> 5000.34]  and she had purposed
[5000.34 --> 5003.02]  to use what she had learned to save lives.
[5003.14 --> 5005.12]  Her niece way up country in Lofa
[5005.12 --> 5006.46]  had said, had called her,
[5006.52 --> 5008.18]  my baby's very ill, what do I do?
[5008.56 --> 5011.36]  And she had the knowledge to be able to tell her,
[5011.64 --> 5012.76]  keep the baby on the breast,
[5012.84 --> 5014.50]  make sure you give her sterile water,
[5014.64 --> 5015.64]  boil it for five minutes,
[5015.76 --> 5017.58]  and, you know, and the things that were needed
[5017.58 --> 5018.60]  in order to make sure
[5018.60 --> 5020.60]  that that infant didn't die of dehydration,
[5020.76 --> 5021.82]  which is really the cause
[5021.82 --> 5024.26]  when you have diarrhea for a small thing,
[5024.38 --> 5026.16]  a baby, that baby lived.
[5026.74 --> 5028.68]  And she was rejoicing in the fact
[5028.68 --> 5029.82]  that she had the tools
[5029.82 --> 5031.60]  to be able to make a difference
[5031.60 --> 5034.28]  in her nation and in her family's lives.
[5035.12 --> 5036.56]  You know, if we stop to think,
[5036.64 --> 5038.10]  where do we use water today?
[5038.84 --> 5040.80]  Every one of you have used it in some way.
[5040.90 --> 5041.80]  You had a cup of coffee,
[5042.02 --> 5042.94]  you had a shower,
[5043.18 --> 5044.76]  you flushed the toilet, you know.
[5045.06 --> 5046.60]  There are so many things
[5046.60 --> 5047.58]  that we use water for
[5047.58 --> 5049.32]  and we don't even think about it.
[5049.42 --> 5050.46]  But it is not the same
[5050.46 --> 5051.84]  in the nations that we work in.
[5053.40 --> 5055.06]  And in fact, there's like almost,
[5055.36 --> 5057.48]  over two billion people
[5057.48 --> 5059.36]  don't have safe potable water today.
[5059.36 --> 5062.66]  It's unfathomable.
[5063.26 --> 5064.20]  Almost four billion
[5064.20 --> 5065.38]  don't have a safe place
[5065.38 --> 5066.32]  to toilet with dignity.
[5066.90 --> 5067.52]  And a staggering,
[5067.76 --> 5069.26]  every 35 seconds,
[5069.42 --> 5071.06]  a child usually dies
[5071.06 --> 5072.40]  from a waterborne disease.
[5073.08 --> 5074.78]  It's something that you have taken
[5074.78 --> 5076.50]  an initiative to do something about
[5076.50 --> 5077.22]  with the projects
[5077.22 --> 5078.12]  that you have sponsored.
[5078.28 --> 5079.72]  You've been making an impact.
[5080.02 --> 5081.76]  When we first started in 1995,
[5082.10 --> 5084.02]  the statistic was about 12 seconds.
[5084.02 --> 5086.94]  So movement has been happening
[5086.94 --> 5088.36]  in a positive direction,
[5088.70 --> 5090.74]  but there's a long way to go.
[5092.18 --> 5093.68]  The other factor with water
[5093.68 --> 5097.50]  is the burden on the women and children.
[5098.58 --> 5100.22]  They walk long distances.
[5100.56 --> 5101.74]  They carry heavy buckets,
[5101.90 --> 5103.10]  usually with like a toddler
[5103.10 --> 5103.74]  on their back,
[5103.82 --> 5105.24]  maybe one on the side,
[5105.66 --> 5107.36]  and they're carrying it
[5107.36 --> 5108.32]  on their head back.
[5108.56 --> 5110.26]  In the wee hours of the morning,
[5110.36 --> 5111.18]  walking kilometers,
[5111.68 --> 5112.72]  I mean a five-gallon bucket
[5112.72 --> 5113.98]  weighs about 40 pounds.
[5114.26 --> 5115.56]  It's a hardness.
[5116.02 --> 5117.28]  It's hard on the body.
[5117.90 --> 5119.68]  There are snakes.
[5120.02 --> 5121.72]  There are animals.
[5121.90 --> 5122.78]  There are human critters
[5122.78 --> 5123.58]  that take advantage
[5123.58 --> 5124.88]  of women walking in the dark.
[5125.48 --> 5126.42]  The other factor
[5126.42 --> 5127.54]  that happens with women
[5127.54 --> 5128.04]  is that,
[5128.16 --> 5129.26]  especially with a girl child
[5129.26 --> 5130.72]  in school age,
[5130.92 --> 5132.46]  they miss about a week
[5132.46 --> 5135.04]  out of every month of school
[5135.04 --> 5136.06]  because there's nothing,
[5136.58 --> 5138.68]  they don't have anything to,
[5138.94 --> 5140.20]  no sanitary pads
[5140.20 --> 5143.52]  in order to keep them in school
[5143.52 --> 5144.54]  when they have their menses.
[5145.20 --> 5148.26]  We've been taking some impact on that.
[5148.62 --> 5151.44]  We discovered that a couple of years ago
[5151.44 --> 5151.86]  in Kenya
[5151.86 --> 5154.48]  that girls were actually trading sex for pads.
[5154.48 --> 5158.14]  and so my heart,
[5158.14 --> 5159.14]  I just couldn't,
[5159.26 --> 5161.34]  I felt we could do something
[5161.34 --> 5162.52]  to change that.
[5163.14 --> 5165.06]  And we started a small sewing industry
[5165.06 --> 5166.34]  in Kenya
[5166.34 --> 5167.74]  and have some single moms
[5167.74 --> 5169.02]  because unfortunately
[5169.02 --> 5170.12]  that was an outcome
[5170.12 --> 5171.10]  on planned pregnancies
[5171.10 --> 5172.44]  from that action.
[5172.44 --> 5174.42]  and they are making
[5174.42 --> 5176.16]  reusable sanitary pads
[5176.16 --> 5177.70]  for all of our teams in Kenya.
[5178.16 --> 5179.22]  And about 10 days ago
[5179.22 --> 5180.80]  they were actually approved
[5180.80 --> 5182.16]  by the Kenya government
[5182.16 --> 5183.80]  as an official business
[5183.80 --> 5185.20]  and given a license
[5185.20 --> 5186.40]  so that they can now sell
[5186.40 --> 5187.36]  those pads retail
[5187.36 --> 5188.74]  to other non-profits
[5188.74 --> 5189.56]  and local people
[5189.56 --> 5191.24]  that would like to buy them.
[5191.44 --> 5193.42]  And so that's been so successful.
[5193.70 --> 5194.50]  And in the schools
[5194.50 --> 5195.20]  that we've been placing
[5195.20 --> 5196.64]  those pads into the girls,
[5196.78 --> 5197.60]  there have been no
[5197.60 --> 5198.84]  unplanned pregnancies.
[5198.84 --> 5199.96]  it's like, yes.
[5200.58 --> 5201.82]  So a very successful,
[5202.08 --> 5202.50]  impactful,
[5203.74 --> 5205.42]  it's really a small thing
[5205.42 --> 5207.42]  but making lives
[5207.42 --> 5208.78]  much better and changing.
[5209.44 --> 5210.50]  We've now initiated
[5210.50 --> 5212.18]  that program
[5212.18 --> 5213.36]  in Liberia
[5213.36 --> 5214.06]  and in Kenya
[5214.06 --> 5215.50]  and we are considering
[5215.50 --> 5215.98]  having,
[5216.38 --> 5217.14]  we can't ship
[5217.14 --> 5218.78]  into Haiti
[5218.78 --> 5219.74]  because it's politically
[5219.74 --> 5220.82]  such a mess right now
[5220.82 --> 5221.96]  but we could start
[5221.96 --> 5223.12]  a little micro enterprise
[5223.12 --> 5223.98]  there for them
[5223.98 --> 5224.68]  to start to sell
[5224.68 --> 5225.28]  their own pads
[5225.28 --> 5226.34]  because they are interested
[5226.34 --> 5227.12]  in doing that.
[5228.84 --> 5230.00]  This is where we work
[5230.00 --> 5230.64]  in Haiti.
[5231.26 --> 5232.70]  We have a team,
[5232.82 --> 5233.70]  we're about to initiate
[5233.70 --> 5235.00]  a new drill team as well
[5235.00 --> 5235.72]  into Haiti,
[5236.12 --> 5236.94]  into Liberia.
[5237.08 --> 5238.50]  I have three big teams
[5238.50 --> 5239.88]  there into Kenya,
[5240.02 --> 5241.04]  again three teams
[5241.04 --> 5242.02]  covering east to west
[5242.02 --> 5242.50]  of Kenya
[5242.50 --> 5244.44]  and a huge team
[5244.44 --> 5245.08]  in Nigeria
[5245.08 --> 5246.28]  that are centered
[5246.28 --> 5247.82]  around Abuja
[5247.82 --> 5248.44]  but are looking
[5248.44 --> 5249.12]  to come down
[5249.12 --> 5250.30]  to reach further
[5250.30 --> 5251.80]  into the needy areas
[5251.80 --> 5253.04]  in their country.
[5254.76 --> 5255.02]  You know,
[5255.04 --> 5255.78]  when Jim started,
[5255.78 --> 5257.10]  he was going
[5257.10 --> 5258.80]  to go and do,
[5259.24 --> 5259.46]  you know,
[5259.54 --> 5260.40]  get a drill rig,
[5260.56 --> 5260.92]  go over,
[5260.98 --> 5261.84]  train a few guys,
[5262.32 --> 5263.30]  show them how
[5263.30 --> 5264.04]  to find water,
[5264.10 --> 5264.58]  how to drill,
[5264.68 --> 5265.38]  how to plant a pump
[5265.38 --> 5266.44]  and drill a couple
[5266.44 --> 5267.34]  of wells and go home.
[5268.18 --> 5268.66]  Deed done.
[5269.42 --> 5270.24]  When he got there,
[5270.30 --> 5271.34]  it was a civil war,
[5271.44 --> 5273.28]  he saw horrendous sites.
[5273.54 --> 5275.60]  He saw a 5,000 plus people,
[5275.80 --> 5277.14]  displaced persons camp
[5277.14 --> 5277.76]  and all they had
[5277.76 --> 5278.78]  was a shallow creek.
[5279.06 --> 5280.24]  That was where they bathed,
[5280.30 --> 5281.16]  that's where they drank,
[5281.30 --> 5282.56]  that's where their animals drank,
[5282.56 --> 5283.60]  that's everything.
[5284.78 --> 5286.74]  So horrifying.
[5287.12 --> 5288.14]  He knew when he came home
[5288.14 --> 5289.96]  that that wasn't all
[5289.96 --> 5290.82]  that he could do.
[5291.78 --> 5296.02]  And so this three-phase approach,
[5296.12 --> 5296.74]  we call it,
[5296.88 --> 5298.68]  became kind of the platform
[5298.68 --> 5300.26]  and it has done us well.
[5300.38 --> 5300.86]  It is a good,
[5301.04 --> 5301.98]  solid foundation.
[5302.62 --> 5302.94]  We go,
[5303.06 --> 5304.12]  we train and equip
[5304.12 --> 5304.96]  the local people.
[5305.28 --> 5306.72]  The local people work
[5306.72 --> 5308.00]  within their nation
[5308.00 --> 5309.88]  and within their own tribes
[5309.88 --> 5311.66]  and they show them
[5311.66 --> 5312.74]  how to do the work.
[5312.88 --> 5314.34]  They bring them alongside
[5314.34 --> 5316.12]  to work along with them.
[5316.42 --> 5317.40]  They have ownership
[5317.40 --> 5318.94]  within their own villages.
[5319.52 --> 5321.28]  And then to complete that circle,
[5321.86 --> 5323.74]  we on this side of the pond
[5323.74 --> 5325.40]  kind of try to share
[5325.40 --> 5326.74]  what the need is
[5326.74 --> 5327.90]  and raise the funds
[5327.90 --> 5329.64]  to be able to funnel back
[5329.64 --> 5330.66]  so that they can go
[5330.66 --> 5333.34]  and mobilize local people
[5333.34 --> 5334.20]  so they can drill the wells
[5334.20 --> 5334.76]  so that they,
[5334.94 --> 5335.10]  you know,
[5335.24 --> 5337.02]  there's a nice little circle there.
[5337.24 --> 5339.56]  And it's been a good,
[5339.56 --> 5340.66]  steady foundation
[5340.66 --> 5341.76]  even through COVID,
[5342.00 --> 5343.34]  Life Water prospered
[5343.34 --> 5345.12]  because our teams knew
[5345.12 --> 5346.20]  what they were doing.
[5346.38 --> 5347.28]  They had the equipment
[5347.28 --> 5349.44]  and they had the knowledge.
[5349.72 --> 5349.90]  I mean,
[5349.94 --> 5350.62]  the Bible says
[5350.62 --> 5351.66]  my people perish
[5351.66 --> 5352.80]  for lack of knowledge.
[5353.42 --> 5354.30]  And, you know,
[5354.32 --> 5355.58]  we've seen that over and over.
[5355.68 --> 5356.64]  You give them the tools,
[5356.74 --> 5359.58]  you give them the education
[5359.58 --> 5360.92]  so they know how to fish,
[5361.06 --> 5362.22]  then they can feed themselves,
[5362.68 --> 5362.92]  right?
[5364.50 --> 5365.90]  This is the work that we do.
[5365.90 --> 5367.36]  We repair pumps,
[5367.62 --> 5368.44]  everybody's pumps,
[5368.56 --> 5369.36]  not just ours.
[5369.76 --> 5371.68]  We rehabilitate wells
[5371.68 --> 5373.20]  so that they're derelict wells
[5373.20 --> 5374.76]  but the borehole is good.
[5375.18 --> 5376.14]  We build washrooms.
[5376.92 --> 5378.12]  We have now initiated
[5378.12 --> 5379.30]  the Dignity Kit Program
[5379.30 --> 5380.56]  with the sanitary pads.
[5381.54 --> 5382.82]  We teach health
[5382.82 --> 5383.88]  and hygiene workshops.
[5384.84 --> 5386.80]  And that is now
[5386.80 --> 5389.58]  about 500 or 600 projects
[5389.58 --> 5390.80]  a month coming in.
[5391.80 --> 5392.88]  In the early days
[5392.88 --> 5395.70]  when Jim saw that situation
[5395.70 --> 5396.44]  in Liberia,
[5396.76 --> 5397.76]  the kind of, you know,
[5398.48 --> 5400.30]  it was overwhelming.
[5400.98 --> 5401.98]  How do you start
[5401.98 --> 5403.10]  to make a difference?
[5403.22 --> 5404.34]  And so he kind of, you know,
[5404.36 --> 5404.90]  thought, okay,
[5405.24 --> 5406.96]  I can, let's do the easy ones first
[5406.96 --> 5407.70]  so that we can reach
[5407.70 --> 5408.28]  the most people.
[5408.36 --> 5409.18]  The easy ones first,
[5409.26 --> 5410.22]  let's reach the most people.
[5410.70 --> 5412.06]  And that was kind of the mantra
[5412.06 --> 5414.04]  as they moved forward
[5414.04 --> 5414.78]  over the years
[5414.78 --> 5415.78]  and through the war years.
[5416.16 --> 5417.58]  We've progressed beyond that
[5417.58 --> 5418.42]  in 30 years
[5418.42 --> 5420.02]  and we are now looking,
[5420.16 --> 5420.72]  how do we make
[5420.72 --> 5422.20]  the hard to reach ones easy?
[5423.78 --> 5425.04]  And we're doing that
[5425.04 --> 5426.92]  by some pretty cool
[5426.92 --> 5428.66]  technological innovations.
[5428.92 --> 5431.24]  You see on your right
[5431.24 --> 5434.28]  a drill rig that's truck mounted
[5434.28 --> 5435.34]  on an Azusa truck,
[5435.44 --> 5436.44]  very maneuverable,
[5436.54 --> 5438.10]  off-roading almost capacity.
[5438.80 --> 5440.52]  It can still drill through rock.
[5440.60 --> 5441.80]  It's an air hammer drill rig
[5441.80 --> 5444.28]  and do what big rigs can do.
[5444.28 --> 5445.88]  But if you have a big drill rig,
[5445.88 --> 5446.98]  you have to have good roads.
[5447.42 --> 5449.04]  And where the hard to reach ones are,
[5449.12 --> 5450.20]  there are no good roads.
[5450.74 --> 5452.20]  And so this can go on riverbeds,
[5452.26 --> 5453.26]  it can go on footpaths,
[5453.28 --> 5454.14]  it can go on the narrow
[5454.14 --> 5455.12]  handmade bridges.
[5456.08 --> 5457.16]  We have just,
[5457.50 --> 5460.24]  are now just entertaining,
[5460.82 --> 5462.28]  looking at a model
[5462.28 --> 5463.68]  that's coming out of China
[5463.68 --> 5467.06]  that is a motorcycle-mounted rig.
[5467.22 --> 5468.24]  We're very excited.
[5468.40 --> 5469.06]  It's going to arrive
[5469.06 --> 5469.78]  into Vancouver
[5469.78 --> 5471.20]  in about 10 days
[5471.20 --> 5472.70]  and be shipped to Lethbridge
[5472.70 --> 5474.02]  so that we can trial it
[5474.02 --> 5476.34]  and see if there's
[5476.34 --> 5477.38]  any further modifications
[5477.38 --> 5478.26]  that need to be done.
[5478.62 --> 5480.12]  And then do video
[5480.12 --> 5481.28]  of how it works
[5481.28 --> 5482.20]  and how to maintain it.
[5482.30 --> 5483.34]  And that rig then
[5483.34 --> 5484.48]  will be shipped into Haiti
[5484.48 --> 5486.84]  along with virtual training on it
[5486.84 --> 5488.82]  because Haiti is not safe right now
[5488.82 --> 5490.32]  for us to travel to to train.
[5490.94 --> 5491.90]  So that's really
[5491.90 --> 5493.48]  a pretty sweet innovation
[5493.48 --> 5495.04]  that's coming up.
[5495.94 --> 5496.44]  You know,
[5496.48 --> 5497.82]  and I just wanted to remind you,
[5497.82 --> 5498.26]  you know,
[5498.58 --> 5499.68]  all through the Bible,
[5499.68 --> 5500.98]  there have been times
[5500.98 --> 5501.92]  where God has said,
[5502.38 --> 5502.54]  you know,
[5502.58 --> 5503.34]  make an altar,
[5503.86 --> 5504.08]  you know,
[5504.20 --> 5504.90]  pile the stones
[5504.90 --> 5505.94]  and remind yourself
[5505.94 --> 5507.34]  of the good that you have done
[5507.34 --> 5509.44]  because it's good
[5509.44 --> 5510.52]  to remind ourselves
[5510.52 --> 5511.86]  that there is,
[5512.04 --> 5512.52]  the effort
[5512.52 --> 5513.94]  and the labor of our hands
[5513.94 --> 5515.74]  has made a difference.
[5515.94 --> 5517.40]  It's made an impact.
[5517.90 --> 5519.12]  And you have done that
[5519.12 --> 5519.90]  with your work
[5519.90 --> 5520.58]  in the villages
[5520.58 --> 5521.72]  such as you see up there.
[5524.86 --> 5525.92]  Some of you may know
[5525.92 --> 5526.64]  this organization
[5526.64 --> 5527.80]  called Charity Intelligence.
[5527.80 --> 5530.10]  It rates about 850 nonprofits
[5530.10 --> 5531.08]  across Canada
[5531.08 --> 5533.94]  along with the same kind of criteria.
[5534.20 --> 5535.52]  We have been highly rated
[5535.52 --> 5536.84]  for the last six years
[5536.84 --> 5538.60]  and unofficially seven.
[5538.94 --> 5540.98]  The outcome of the next rating
[5540.98 --> 5542.40]  comes out in October.
[5543.34 --> 5546.46]  We have touched a 9.5 plus.
[5546.76 --> 5547.44]  I think actually
[5547.44 --> 5549.32]  with what came in last week,
[5549.38 --> 5551.84]  we're almost at 9.6 million people.
[5552.32 --> 5553.20]  And as I said before,
[5553.20 --> 5556.36]  we're doing 500 to 600 projects.
[5557.18 --> 5560.72]  And we are doing that successfully
[5560.72 --> 5562.00]  because, you know,
[5562.06 --> 5563.14]  we run really lean.
[5563.78 --> 5564.06]  You know,
[5564.12 --> 5564.96]  we're very careful
[5564.96 --> 5565.80]  with our funds.
[5566.22 --> 5567.12]  I'm a volunteer.
[5568.00 --> 5569.64]  I have staff now,
[5569.78 --> 5571.52]  but they all work long and hard.
[5572.00 --> 5573.44]  We keep our overhead low,
[5573.52 --> 5574.48]  under 10%.
[5574.48 --> 5576.22]  We make sure that you know,
[5576.56 --> 5578.08]  and donors like you know,
[5578.16 --> 5579.26]  where your money went
[5579.26 --> 5581.28]  so that you can be encouraged
[5581.28 --> 5582.92]  that you are making a difference.
[5583.24 --> 5584.50]  I often look at Life Water
[5584.50 --> 5585.72]  as a bit of a bridge.
[5586.04 --> 5586.18]  You know,
[5586.44 --> 5587.56]  you have a heart
[5587.56 --> 5588.40]  that you want to help,
[5588.60 --> 5589.74]  and yet you don't necessarily
[5589.74 --> 5591.28]  have the pathway
[5591.28 --> 5592.88]  to be able to make an impact.
[5593.00 --> 5593.88]  But you can travel
[5593.88 --> 5595.18]  along the Life Water Bridge
[5595.18 --> 5596.44]  to go right into the nations
[5596.44 --> 5597.76]  and really make
[5597.76 --> 5598.66]  and give hope
[5598.66 --> 5599.34]  to villages
[5599.34 --> 5600.66]  and to people in need.
[5600.90 --> 5601.76]  So thank you.
[5601.76 --> 5604.60]  I have a couple
[5604.60 --> 5605.24]  sign-up sheets
[5605.24 --> 5605.90]  at the back
[5605.90 --> 5606.42]  in the foyer.
[5606.90 --> 5608.54]  I have a monthly prayer group
[5608.54 --> 5609.24]  that I email
[5609.24 --> 5610.60]  some needs for Canada.
[5610.80 --> 5611.76]  There's also a sign-up
[5611.76 --> 5612.80]  if you'd like to hear
[5612.80 --> 5613.66]  more about Life Water.
[5613.76 --> 5614.40]  We send out
[5614.40 --> 5616.10]  twice a year newsletters.
[5616.52 --> 5617.60]  We have things called
[5617.60 --> 5618.48]  town halls,
[5618.62 --> 5619.86]  which is about a quarterly,
[5620.42 --> 5621.84]  a virtual meeting
[5621.84 --> 5622.62]  where you can talk
[5622.62 --> 5623.62]  to local,
[5623.76 --> 5624.30]  some of the people
[5624.30 --> 5625.02]  that work overseas
[5625.02 --> 5625.56]  or us
[5625.56 --> 5626.32]  and ask questions.
[5627.28 --> 5629.60]  And just very grateful
[5629.60 --> 5630.82]  that you have us
[5630.82 --> 5631.52]  on your offering.
[5632.28 --> 5633.20]  that steady
[5633.20 --> 5636.02]  support really is
[5636.02 --> 5636.82]  allowing us
[5636.82 --> 5638.40]  to look forward
[5638.40 --> 5639.70]  over the next 30 years
[5639.70 --> 5640.66]  and make some plans
[5640.66 --> 5641.78]  to reach even more people.
[5643.36 --> 5643.66]  You know,
[5643.90 --> 5645.52]  you never know
[5645.52 --> 5646.50]  when you give
[5646.50 --> 5647.14]  a cup of water
[5647.14 --> 5647.96]  to somebody,
[5648.12 --> 5649.36]  when you help someone
[5649.36 --> 5650.48]  and a helping hand
[5650.48 --> 5651.96]  who you're really helping.
[5652.36 --> 5652.56]  I mean,
[5652.60 --> 5653.20]  Jesus says
[5653.20 --> 5654.52]  you could be helping him
[5654.52 --> 5655.46]  and indirectly
[5655.46 --> 5656.46]  as we learned today,
[5656.80 --> 5656.98]  you know,
[5657.04 --> 5658.08]  his spirit lives in us
[5658.08 --> 5659.20]  and so as we reach out
[5659.20 --> 5659.72]  to help those
[5659.72 --> 5660.32]  that are in need,
[5660.64 --> 5661.06]  we really,
[5661.06 --> 5662.82]  loving our neighbor
[5662.82 --> 5663.88]  as ourself
[5663.88 --> 5666.28]  and shining the light
[5666.28 --> 5666.66]  of Jesus
[5666.66 --> 5668.62]  to those that we lend
[5668.62 --> 5669.50]  that helping hand to.
[5670.04 --> 5670.98]  Thanks for being a partner.
[5672.32 --> 5673.32]  applause
[5673.32 --> 5683.98]  That was very,
[5684.30 --> 5685.66]  that's very wonderful to hear.
[5685.98 --> 5686.98]  Thanks for that presentation.
[5688.58 --> 5689.74]  And like she said,
[5689.80 --> 5690.88]  there's a table in the back,
[5690.96 --> 5691.50]  the foyer table
[5691.50 --> 5692.22]  with information
[5692.22 --> 5693.36]  after the service.
[5694.98 --> 5696.90]  And now for our offering today,
[5696.90 --> 5698.60]  it is for Bethesda.
[5698.60 --> 5699.60]  Bethesda.
[5699.60 --> 5700.86]  And just about all of us
[5700.86 --> 5703.02]  are familiar with Bethesda
[5703.02 --> 5704.10]  and know several people
[5704.10 --> 5704.92]  who have benefited
[5704.92 --> 5706.10]  from their services.
[5707.24 --> 5709.08]  Bethesda supports individuals
[5709.08 --> 5710.70]  who have intellectual
[5710.70 --> 5712.44]  and developmental disabilities.
[5713.36 --> 5714.30]  And their services
[5714.30 --> 5715.48]  encourage choice
[5715.48 --> 5716.44]  and independence
[5716.44 --> 5717.58]  and safety.
[5718.14 --> 5719.94]  And they work with each person
[5719.94 --> 5721.68]  for their specific needs.
[5721.68 --> 5724.00]  So thank you for your support
[5724.00 --> 5725.76]  for Bethesda.
[5726.12 --> 5728.34]  And we can call the deacons up.
[5728.84 --> 5729.12]  Okay?
[5729.12 --> 5729.18]  Okay.
[5729.28 --> 5729.44]  Okay.
[5729.44 --> 5737.22]  Thank you.
[5737.22 --> 5767.20]  Thank you.
[5767.22 --> 5797.20]  Thank you.
[5797.22 --> 5827.20]  Thank you.
[5827.22 --> 5857.20]  Thank you.
[5857.22 --> 5859.86]  And so we trust in you and put our hope in you.
[5860.74 --> 5863.34]  Show us your ways, Lord, and teach us your paths.
[5864.22 --> 5867.74]  Guide us in your truth and teach us, for you are God, our Savior.
[5868.36 --> 5871.10]  And our hope is in you all day long.
[5871.10 --> 5876.68]  Heavenly Father, we come to you and we pray for the work of the gospel around the world.
[5877.38 --> 5881.10]  Especially this morning, Lord, thank you for the work of Life Water.
[5881.10 --> 5890.64]  Thank you, Lord, for Linda's visit, for the way that you directed her and her husband, Lord, to meet a need.
[5890.64 --> 5900.20]  And, Lord, you gave them a vision and you gave them, Lord, the grace to follow after you and to serve others in your name.
[5900.28 --> 5906.76]  And so, Lord, we pray that you would give all of their staff, their workers, your wisdom, your protection.
[5906.76 --> 5910.86]  Lord, give them love for the people of the world that they serve.
[5911.86 --> 5916.28]  Lord, give them a continual awareness of your loving kindness in their lives.
[5916.28 --> 5922.36]  And, Lord, we ask that you would open up doors for the gospel in all the places where they serve.
[5923.20 --> 5927.16]  Lord, we ask that you would help them to be salt and light of Jesus Christ.
[5927.26 --> 5929.20]  And, Lord, we pray for the needs of the world.
[5930.16 --> 5939.60]  Lord, and we thank you that you are the living water and that all who drink of you will have eternal life.
[5939.60 --> 5948.08]  And thank you, Lord, that you call us to be your people who share that living water, not only spiritual water, but, Lord, physical water.
[5949.68 --> 5953.78]  Lord, we pray for those in our congregation, Lord, who need your care.
[5953.86 --> 5961.16]  And we especially, Lord, this morning pray for Edgar and his whole family, Lord, as they mourn the death of Edgar's father.
[5961.70 --> 5962.78]  Lord, it is such a loss.
[5964.08 --> 5968.48]  And many of us, Lord, know what he's going through.
[5968.48 --> 5972.00]  And so, Lord, we pray that you would surround him with your love and your care.
[5972.64 --> 5977.80]  And, Lord, we pray for healing upon him and his family and for also his family in Hong Kong.
[5979.14 --> 5982.86]  Lord, for others who are struggling, Lord, may you be our great comforter.
[5984.24 --> 5993.80]  And, Father, as we are beginning this season of ministry here in the fall, we lift up to you all of our various ministries and all those who are serving in various ways.
[5993.80 --> 6005.08]  Lord, we thank you for our Sunday school, for Gems and Cadets, for cross-training classes, for small groups, for Friendship Coffeehouse and ESL, and other ministries, Lord.
[6005.14 --> 6012.10]  And so we ask that you would bless these ministries and that you would go before us and empower each of us by your Holy Spirit.
[6012.10 --> 6017.94]  Lord, as we serve one another and as we gather together in fellowship, help us to be rooted in you.
[6018.96 --> 6022.42]  And may these ministries bring us joy and help us to grow closer to you.
[6023.74 --> 6026.16]  And, Father, we thank you for your unfailing love for us.
[6026.36 --> 6029.26]  And let our lives, O Lord, be a living sacrifice for you.
[6029.80 --> 6038.02]  Help us, Lord, to put our hope in you and long for the day when we will see you face to face and when you will come to renew all things.
[6038.02 --> 6041.30]  And we pray, Lord, in your name, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[6041.78 --> 6042.08]  Amen.
[6043.86 --> 6044.86]  So let's all stand.
[6045.40 --> 6047.48]  And we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[6047.94 --> 6051.68]  Again, we invite you to stay for lunch.
[6052.62 --> 6058.78]  And why don't I pray for our lunch right now so that we don't feel unsure of what to do later.
[6059.18 --> 6062.70]  So I'll pray for our lunch and then we'll receive the Lord's blessing.
[6062.70 --> 6071.56]  Lord, and we again thank you for this time of fellowship that we're about to enjoy, for the food that you provide for us, for the hands that have helped set up and fix it.
[6072.06 --> 6078.86]  Lord, grant us your blessing as we enjoy you and one another as we have this meal.
[6079.08 --> 6080.14]  Lord, we pray in your name.
[6080.30 --> 6080.56]  Amen.
[6081.60 --> 6084.68]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[6084.68 --> 6094.20]  May the Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
[6094.60 --> 6098.20]  encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.
[6098.82 --> 6099.18]  Amen.
[6099.18 --> 6099.28]  Amen.
[6099.28 --> 6099.32]  Amen.
[6114.68 --> 6115.68]  Amen.
[6144.68 --> 6145.68]  Amen.
[6174.68 --> 6175.68]  Amen.
[6204.68 --> 6205.68]  Amen.
