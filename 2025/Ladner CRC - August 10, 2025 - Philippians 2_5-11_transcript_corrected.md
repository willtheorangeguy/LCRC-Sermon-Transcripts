[262.00 → 291.98] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[291.98 → 298.74] Friends, welcome to Leonard Christian Reformed Church.
[298.74 → 305.50] If you are a regular part of this Sunday service, we are so glad to have you with us again.
[305.50 → 313.86] And if this is your first time here, we welcome you, and please feel at home because this is
[313.86 → 317.50] the house of God, and we are his family.
[317.50 → 323.74] Through the faith in his only-begotten son, we become his children.
[324.70 → 325.30] So welcome.
[325.30 → 329.78] And today is a special occasion.
[329.78 → 332.38] It's Family Worship Sunday.
[332.38 → 340.26] That means our Chinese-speaking brothers and sisters and our English fellowship will join
[340.26 → 342.88] together to worship our Lord.
[343.28 → 347.20] And the children will worship alongside with their families.
[347.20 → 357.80] This morning, we will remember our Lord Jesus Christ through the celebration of the Lord's
[357.80 → 361.32] Supper by partaking his cup and his bread.
[361.32 → 369.40] And we are glad to have Pastor Tim to lead us through this communion service.
[369.40 → 371.82] And welcome Pastor Tim.
[372.72 → 380.92] Pastor Tim Syrian is a church planting leader for Resonant Global Mission and a professor
[380.92 → 388.36] of congregational theology at Mission Training Centre located in Phoenix, USA.
[388.36 → 396.18] And he has served in pastor's ministry for over 20 years in both Canada and United States.
[396.18 → 403.42] And right now he lives in Maple Ridge with his wife Andrea and the four children and one
[403.42 → 404.20] son-in-law.
[404.46 → 405.82] We welcome you, Pastor Tim.
[405.82 → 405.88] Thank you.
[410.92 → 421.24] So, brothers and sisters, as we gather in the presence of our God, we are reminded why
[421.24 → 421.92] we are here.
[421.92 → 427.12] Not to be entertained, not to perform, but to worship.
[429.14 → 435.76] To lift our voices and hearts in praise to the one whose name is above every name.
[435.76 → 444.88] Let these words from Psalm 135 call us into a joyful worship.
[444.88 → 451.08] So I will read the line with a single arrow.
[451.08 → 455.08] And everybody will read the line with a double arrow.
[455.08 → 456.08] Praise the Lord.
[456.08 → 459.08] Praise the name of the Lord.
[459.08 → 463.66] Praise Him, your servants of the Lord.
[463.66 → 469.30] You who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
[469.30 → 472.26] Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good.
[472.26 → 475.20] Sing praise to His name, for that is pleasant.
[475.20 → 488.30] Great is the Lord, and the most worthy of praise.
[488.88 → 491.02] His greatness no one can fathom.
[491.02 → 495.32] It's from Psalm 145, verse 3.
[496.02 → 496.92] Let's pray together.
[496.92 → 506.58] Almighty and everlasting God, we gather this morning as your people, called, redeemed, and
[506.58 → 511.76] sustained by your grace, to lift our hearts in awe and adoration.
[512.44 → 517.86] You are the creator of the heavens and the earth, the one who spoke light into the darkness,
[518.48 → 521.70] who set the stars in place and shaped the seas.
[521.70 → 528.24] There is none like you in power, in beauty, in holiness.
[528.24 → 535.36] Lord Jesus Christ, you are the readings of God's glory, the exact representation of His being.
[535.36 → 540.70] You humbled yourself, took on flesh, and walked among us.
[540.70 → 545.36] We adore you as our Saviour, our Shepherd, our King.
[545.36 → 552.40] By your cross, we are forgiven, and by your resurrection, we are made alive.
[553.34 → 557.74] Holy Spirit, you breathe life into our worship.
[558.56 → 562.60] You open our eyes to the truth and stir our hearts to sin.
[563.30 → 567.52] You are our comforter, our counsellor, and the giver of peace.
[568.30 → 573.66] Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, all glory belongs to you.
[573.66 → 580.64] We are here not to receive first, but to give, to give you the praise you are so worthy of,
[581.18 → 588.02] to honour your name above every name, to delight in you our greatest joy and treasure.
[588.66 → 591.90] So lift our eyes beyond ourselves today.
[592.56 → 595.02] Turn our hearts to your majesty.
[595.74 → 603.00] Let every word, every song, and every prayer be a fragrant offering of adoration to you.
[603.00 → 605.54] We love you, Lord.
[606.24 → 607.04] We worship you.
[607.76 → 611.80] We glorify your name in this place and in our earth.
[612.86 → 615.00] In Jesus' name, amen.
[618.00 → 624.58] Dear brothers and sisters, as we gather this morning, we remember that worship is not something we begin.
[625.40 → 627.34] It's something we are welcomed into.
[627.34 → 634.26] God himself is the one who calls us, and he is here among us by his spirit.
[634.96 → 639.90] So before we sing, before we speak, before we do anything else, we hear his greeting.
[640.94 → 645.06] A declaration of peace, grace, and love from our God.
[645.86 → 647.40] So let's hear God's greeting.
[647.40 → 656.44] Grace to you and the peace from God, our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[657.98 → 663.36] So as we have been welcomed by God, let us now welcome one another.
[664.18 → 665.98] Take a moment to turn to your neighbour.
[666.84 → 668.36] Greet them in the peace of Christ.
[668.86 → 672.22] And say, the peace of God, Lord, be with you.
[672.22 → 702.20] Thank you.
[702.22 → 703.08] Thank you.
[703.08 → 733.06] Thank you.
[733.08 → 763.06] Thank you.
[763.08 → 765.08] Thank you.
[793.08 → 795.08] Thank you.
[823.08 → 825.08] Thank you.
[853.08 → 855.08] Thank you.
[883.08 → 885.08] Thank you.
[913.08 → 915.08] Thank you.
[943.08 → 945.08] Thank you.
[973.08 → 975.08] Thank you.
[975.08 → 977.08] Thank you.

[1092.68 → 1095.68] Say, to me, to me.
[1095.68 → 1098.68] You have a voice to me.
[1098.68 → 1101.68] You see, we choose you, to me.
[1101.68 → 1107.68] To me, to me.
[1107.68 → 1110.68] Hallelujah!
[1110.68 → 1114.68] Say, to me, to me, to me.
[1114.68 → 1117.68] Hallelujah!
[1117.68 → 1120.68] Say, to me, to me.
[1120.68 → 1123.68] You have a voice to me.
[1123.68 → 1126.68] You have a voice to me.
[1126.68 → 1132.68] Jesus Christ, my name is God.
[1132.68 → 1139.68] Jesus Christ, my name is God.
[1140.68 → 1143.68] Amen.
[1143.68 → 1165.68] We become Christians not because we are perfect, but as those who are in need of grace.
[1165.68 → 1172.68] We confess that we have sinned against our God in thought, in word, and in deed.
[1172.68 → 1176.68] We have not loved you with our whole heart.
[1176.68 → 1181.68] And we have not loved you, not our neighbour, as ourselves.
[1181.68 → 1189.68] We confess the pride, the anger, the selfishness, and the apathy that so easily grow in us.
[1189.68 → 1196.68] So, let's take a time of silence and confess our sins before our merciful God.
[1196.68 → 1197.68] So, let's read some scriptures from, based on Hebrews.
[1197.68 → 1199.68] .
[1199.68 → 1201.68] .
[1201.68 → 1205.68] .
[1205.68 → 1207.68] .
[1207.68 → 1208.68] .
[1208.68 → 1209.68] .
[1209.68 → 1210.68] .
[1210.68 → 1212.68] .
[1212.68 → 1232.48] So let's read some scriptures from, based on Hebrews, chapter 4, verse 15, 16, and Psalm 51, 1-2.
[1232.48 → 1244.00] The scriptures teach us that our Lord Jesus Christ was tempted in every way, just as we are, yet he did not sin.
[1244.58 → 1247.92] Let us therefore cry out with the psalmist.
[1248.80 → 1249.86] We read together.
[1250.38 → 1262.22] Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion, blood of our transgressions.
[1263.42 → 1268.68] Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[1269.42 → 1283.18] Let us then approach God's name, stone of grace, with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[1284.16 → 1285.18] Let's pray together.
[1288.28 → 1292.36] Merciful Father, we confess that we have sinned against you.
[1293.26 → 1296.20] In our thoughts, our words, and our actions.
[1297.12 → 1303.56] We have not loved you with our whole heart, nor have we loved our neighbours as ourselves.
[1304.62 → 1311.48] So please forgive us, renew us, and lead us, that we may walk in your ways.
[1312.22 → 1313.84] Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1314.72 → 1314.98] Amen.
[1314.98 → 1315.08] Amen.
[1316.24 → 1317.58] Let's sing another song.
[1318.18 → 1318.46] Amen.
[1318.46 → 1348.44] Let's sing.
[1348.46 → 1378.44] Let's sing.
[1378.46 → 1408.44] Let's sing.
[1408.44 → 1438.42] Let's sing.
[1438.42 → 1468.40] Let's sing.
[1468.42 → 1498.40] Let's sing.
[1498.42 → 1528.40] Let's sing.

[1828.28 → 1858.26] Let's sing.
[1858.28 → 1888.26] Let's sing.
[1888.26 → 1918.24] Let's sing.
[1918.26 → 1948.24] Let's sing.

[1982.74 → 1985.60] the body and blood of Jesus was given for you.

[2311.26 → 2312.26] Amen.
[2332.26 → 2334.18] I invite you to take the bread.
[2335.56 → 2336.82] Let's eat together.
[2336.82 → 2343.00] Let's remember and believe that Christ's body was given for us to break the power of sin
[2343.00 → 2346.50] and to declare us to be forgiven and loved by God.
[2346.50 → 2356.18] Amen.
[2356.18 → 2356.68] Amen.
[2356.68 → 2357.18] Amen.
[2357.18 → 2358.18] Amen.

[2359.68 → 2360.18] Amen.
[2364.18 → 2364.68] Amen.
[2364.68 → 2365.66] I invite you to take the cup.

[2366.34 → 2366.36] Amen.
[2366.36 → 2366.86] Amen.
[2366.86 → 2371.40] As we drink it, let's remember, believe Christ's blood was poured out to forgive us.
[2372.32 → 2374.74] And one day, he's going to return.
[2375.36 → 2380.00] And we're going to enjoy the most precious wine ever, feasting with our king.
[2380.00 → 2380.24] Amen.

[2395.08 → 2395.38] Amen.
[2395.66 → 2400.66] Thank you.
[2417.34 → 2418.08] Let's pray.
[2418.24 → 2423.02] God, we thank you that you come to us
[2423.02 → 2428.98] as a God who has given his life for the sake of our salvation,
[2429.16 → 2430.28] for the life of this world.
[2432.22 → 2437.84] Would you allow this bread and this cup
[2437.84 → 2443.16] to continue to remind us and to nourish us
[2443.16 → 2444.52] with your very presence,
[2444.88 → 2447.76] your very grace and kindness and love for us in Jesus.
[2448.22 → 2449.26] It's in his name we pray.
[2449.98 → 2450.26] Amen.
[2450.26 → 2456.14] So at this time, if you are age three to grade three,
[2456.48 → 2458.94] you can head out to Sunday school.
[2469.36 → 2471.78] If you're not doing that, if you're going to remain with us,
[2471.82 → 2476.52] you can either turn in your own Bible or the Pew Bible.
[2476.52 → 2479.12] It says here page 873.
[2479.74 → 2482.52] We're going to be reading from Philippians chapter two.
[2499.52 → 2501.02] Philippians chapter two.
[2501.02 → 2505.22] I'm going to be reading from verses five through 11.
[2508.94 → 2511.00] Before I do that, please join me as I pray.
[2511.12 → 2512.74] God, we've opened your word.
[2513.44 → 2516.32] We are soon to read it and reflect upon it.
[2517.00 → 2519.90] We ask, Lord Jesus, that you would come to us,
[2520.96 → 2522.98] clothed in your word,
[2522.98 → 2527.02] to feed us, to feed us, to nourish us, to speak to us.
[2527.76 → 2530.62] Give us eyes, ears, and hearts,
[2531.70 → 2533.16] the entirety of ourselves.
[2533.60 → 2536.34] May we be open to receive what you have for us.
[2537.06 → 2538.14] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2538.96 → 2539.24] Amen.
[2541.42 → 2542.54] Philippians chapter two.
[2542.54 → 2545.08] I'm going to read verses five through 11.
[2546.96 → 2550.38] Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus,
[2551.26 → 2553.38] who being in very nature God,
[2553.52 → 2557.56] did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[2558.12 → 2560.74] but made himself nothing,
[2561.70 → 2563.56] taking the very nature of a servant,
[2564.46 → 2566.28] being made in human likeness,
[2567.66 → 2570.18] and being found in appearance as a human,
[2570.18 → 2572.64] he humbled himself and became obedient to death,
[2572.68 → 2574.08] even death on a cross.
[2575.58 → 2578.30] Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
[2578.30 → 2581.34] and gave him the name that is above every name,
[2582.06 → 2584.98] that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
[2585.48 → 2587.96] in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[2588.74 → 2592.76] and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
[2593.46 → 2595.48] to the glory of God the Father.
[2596.24 → 2597.70] This is the word of the Lord.
[2600.18 → 2605.40] So let me ask a question,
[2605.64 → 2607.40] and if just show of hands,
[2607.86 → 2609.82] and no guilt at all,
[2610.18 → 2611.62] for those who don't raise their hands,
[2611.68 → 2612.64] I'll explain in a minute.
[2612.98 → 2616.58] But anyone out there ever watch an episode of The Mandalorian?
[2617.88 → 2619.14] Any Mandalorian fans?
[2619.24 → 2620.08] Okay, we got a couple.
[2620.32 → 2620.88] Some of you are like,
[2620.96 → 2622.02] what is he talking about?
[2623.14 → 2624.14] That's where I'll help you out.
[2624.14 → 2625.12] So The Mandalorian,
[2625.44 → 2629.32] a fairly popular TV show set in the Star Wars universe,
[2629.66 → 2631.74] and in that show,
[2632.14 → 2633.66] that's what inspired the title,
[2633.74 → 2634.16] The Message,
[2634.98 → 2638.76] there's kind of a summary phrase,
[2638.84 → 2639.74] a shorthand,
[2639.88 → 2640.92] kind of code word,
[2641.18 → 2642.20] code phrase,
[2642.60 → 2645.48] that captures what it means to be a Mandalorian,
[2645.48 → 2647.62] to uphold the tradition,
[2647.62 → 2648.40] and the code,
[2648.40 → 2649.24] and the ethic,
[2649.56 → 2650.52] and the behaviour,
[2651.06 → 2652.40] of what's expected for Mandalorians,
[2653.16 → 2655.08] and it's the title of this message,
[2655.48 → 2656.14] This is the Way.
[2657.34 → 2658.46] Yeah, right?
[2658.64 → 2659.24] Yeah, you know it.
[2659.32 → 2659.94] Yeah, okay.
[2660.34 → 2661.22] This is the Way.
[2663.12 → 2664.34] What inspired that?
[2666.40 → 2668.58] There are a lot of things I could say I won't,
[2668.96 → 2670.56] but let me just say briefly,
[2670.74 → 2672.02] if you want to hear more about this,
[2672.18 → 2674.04] you can come to a conference in September,
[2674.04 → 2675.40] we'll explore this more,
[2675.84 → 2678.32] but we are living in a cultural moment,
[2679.38 → 2681.40] filled with all kinds of challenges,
[2681.40 → 2682.52] to the Christian faith.
[2684.42 → 2685.64] Not the least of which,
[2685.70 → 2687.52] is the way Christianity is represented,
[2687.72 → 2689.08] by certain sections,
[2689.08 → 2691.38] of evangelical Christianity.
[2692.14 → 2693.32] Not the least of which,
[2693.40 → 2694.28] is secularism,
[2694.40 → 2694.92] and pressures,
[2695.14 → 2696.58] that tell us to,
[2696.78 → 2698.90] not take our faith seriously,
[2699.10 → 2700.60] if we at least keep it to ourselves.
[2701.84 → 2702.84] Not the least of which,
[2702.86 → 2703.56] is a lot of stuff,
[2703.56 → 2704.38] that we could talk about.
[2704.92 → 2705.82] That's where you can come,
[2705.90 → 2706.90] to a conference in September,
[2706.90 → 2708.48] if you want to talk more about that.
[2710.18 → 2710.58] But,
[2710.74 → 2712.64] in this cultural moment,
[2713.00 → 2714.26] in which it seems to me,
[2714.34 → 2716.10] the Christian faith is contested,
[2716.96 → 2718.64] in which many people,
[2718.64 → 2720.06] struggle to still believe it,
[2721.06 → 2723.66] in which many young people,
[2723.84 → 2725.62] find it to lack credibility,
[2725.62 → 2729.00] at least the way that Christians,
[2729.00 → 2730.62] represent the faith,
[2731.62 → 2734.60] I've started to wonder,
[2734.84 → 2736.10] if this text,
[2736.90 → 2738.96] and what it has to offer us,
[2739.74 → 2740.84] might be,
[2741.28 → 2742.18] for our moment,
[2743.04 → 2743.84] a kind of,
[2744.02 → 2745.14] this is the way.
[2746.30 → 2747.42] A shorthand,
[2747.56 → 2749.04] that draws us back,
[2749.18 → 2749.40] to,
[2750.02 → 2751.78] what I want to help us see this morning,
[2751.86 → 2752.18] are really,
[2752.18 → 2753.10] these three things,
[2753.16 → 2753.82] are at the core.
[2754.94 → 2756.02] This passage,
[2756.08 → 2756.88] helps us see,
[2757.04 → 2758.12] what the God of the Bible,
[2758.12 → 2758.86] is like,
[2759.50 → 2761.18] what the Christian faith,
[2761.34 → 2762.08] should be about,
[2762.70 → 2764.18] and where the history,
[2764.26 → 2765.16] of this world is headed.
[2766.16 → 2767.66] These are pretty core things.
[2768.54 → 2769.82] Let's dive in,
[2769.90 → 2770.58] this morning,
[2771.14 → 2773.22] by first looking at,
[2773.32 → 2774.32] what this passage,
[2774.58 → 2775.78] has to show us,
[2775.86 → 2776.90] about what the God,
[2776.96 → 2778.10] of the Bible is like.
[2778.10 → 2780.72] Here I'm thinking about,
[2780.78 → 2782.10] verses six through eight,
[2782.72 → 2783.18] and I believe,
[2783.30 → 2783.40] yeah,
[2783.48 → 2784.22] there are some slides,
[2784.56 → 2785.20] some notes,
[2785.98 → 2787.28] if that's helpful to you,
[2787.34 → 2787.54] great,
[2787.82 → 2788.24] if not,
[2788.30 → 2789.02] you can ignore it.
[2789.76 → 2790.52] Chances are,
[2790.58 → 2791.34] let me start this way,
[2791.42 → 2792.58] that if you were to,
[2792.82 → 2794.98] if you were to go out,
[2795.04 → 2795.64] with a friend,
[2795.72 → 2796.68] and let's say your friend,
[2796.72 → 2797.48] was holding a
[2797.48 → 2799.04] a video recording device,
[2799.16 → 2799.72] a smartphone,
[2800.04 → 2800.84] would suffice,
[2801.48 → 2802.86] and the other friend,
[2803.04 → 2803.50] and maybe,
[2803.66 → 2803.98] you know,
[2804.08 → 2804.90] maybe it was you,
[2805.02 → 2805.48] went,
[2805.94 → 2807.32] let's say to the seawall,
[2807.32 → 2808.32] of Stanley Park,
[2808.44 → 2809.36] or I don't know,
[2809.88 → 2810.76] Granville Island,
[2810.92 → 2811.40] let's just pick,
[2811.60 → 2812.60] or English Bay,
[2812.70 → 2813.82] a couple places,
[2813.82 → 2814.34] where people,
[2814.52 → 2815.30] in the Vancouver area,
[2815.44 → 2815.78] gather.
[2816.80 → 2817.48] Quetzal Beach,
[2817.54 → 2818.32] you pick a place.
[2819.68 → 2820.40] And we're to ask,
[2820.48 → 2821.30] the average person,
[2821.38 → 2822.10] walking the streets,
[2822.14 → 2822.70] of Vancouver,
[2823.64 → 2824.86] to describe,
[2825.22 → 2826.58] what they think about,
[2826.66 → 2827.54] when they think about,
[2827.62 → 2828.26] the God,
[2828.30 → 2829.34] of the Christian Bible.
[2832.16 → 2833.62] I will venture a guess,
[2834.66 → 2836.32] that they are unlikely,
[2836.32 → 2837.44] to come back,
[2837.80 → 2838.68] with the response,
[2838.74 → 2839.36] that reflects,
[2839.60 → 2841.08] what this text teaches us.
[2842.80 → 2843.98] There are all kinds of reasons,
[2843.98 → 2845.38] why that might be the case.
[2847.02 → 2847.98] That's why I think,
[2848.12 → 2848.36] this is,
[2848.50 → 2849.42] could be an important text,
[2849.50 → 2850.54] for us to remind us,
[2850.60 → 2852.04] of what God is like,
[2852.08 → 2852.94] that's what this passage,
[2852.94 → 2853.46] is doing.
[2854.72 → 2855.62] Notice with me,
[2856.08 → 2856.74] what Paul,
[2856.92 → 2857.78] is saying here.
[2858.72 → 2859.58] He begins,
[2859.66 → 2861.14] with this sweeping claim,
[2861.28 → 2861.94] that Jesus,
[2862.44 → 2863.22] has existed,
[2863.38 → 2864.40] from all eternity,
[2864.40 → 2865.18] as God.
[2866.32 → 2867.92] He was God,
[2868.00 → 2869.34] by his very nature,
[2869.60 → 2870.76] is how Paul puts it.
[2870.88 → 2871.50] That is,
[2871.96 → 2873.02] the very essence,
[2873.34 → 2874.52] of Goddess,
[2874.94 → 2876.10] is something,
[2876.26 → 2877.16] Jesus had,
[2877.28 → 2877.98] from all eternity.
[2878.48 → 2879.40] Jesus is God.
[2880.08 → 2881.22] He's divine.
[2882.92 → 2884.16] But notice,
[2884.38 → 2885.54] that he didn't consider,
[2885.86 → 2886.52] this equality,
[2886.52 → 2887.28] with God,
[2887.38 → 2888.16] as something,
[2888.32 → 2889.40] as the older translation,
[2889.54 → 2890.04] I read from,
[2890.22 → 2891.14] uses this word,
[2891.22 → 2892.58] something to be grasped.
[2892.58 → 2892.70] Goddess.
[2893.70 → 2894.26] Which is,
[2894.26 → 2895.50] a really strange translation,
[2895.70 → 2896.24] I think that's why,
[2896.32 → 2896.94] newer ones have,
[2897.02 → 2897.70] refreshed it a bit.
[2898.32 → 2899.16] It's not,
[2899.36 → 2900.78] that Jesus is trying,
[2900.84 → 2902.24] to snatch at something,
[2902.82 → 2903.80] grasp equality,
[2903.80 → 2904.20] with God.
[2904.22 → 2904.98] He's already got it.
[2906.44 → 2907.22] And it's not,
[2907.34 → 2907.84] that he's about,
[2907.96 → 2908.64] to lose it.
[2908.92 → 2909.38] Like you know,
[2909.48 → 2909.98] if you're going,
[2909.98 → 2910.54] to lose something,
[2910.60 → 2910.94] you might try,
[2911.00 → 2911.64] to grasp it,
[2911.72 → 2912.72] to hang on to it.
[2912.86 → 2913.42] That's not,
[2913.50 → 2914.10] what's going on.
[2914.14 → 2914.46] He's not,
[2914.54 → 2914.96] he's not going,
[2914.96 → 2916.02] to lose his,
[2916.08 → 2916.86] his Goddess.
[2917.72 → 2919.26] But what Paul's saying here,
[2919.34 → 2919.88] is that this,
[2920.28 → 2921.12] that Jesus did not,
[2921.24 → 2922.10] treat this equality,
[2922.10 → 2922.80] with God,
[2922.86 → 2923.38] as something,
[2923.52 → 2924.32] that he would leverage,
[2924.32 → 2925.36] for his own advantage.
[2927.44 → 2928.92] It was not a motivation,
[2928.92 → 2930.40] for him to assert himself,
[2931.20 → 2932.72] or puff himself up,
[2932.74 → 2933.42] with pride,
[2934.16 → 2935.30] or flaunt,
[2935.38 → 2936.88] the fact that he was God.
[2938.66 → 2939.60] He could have.
[2940.78 → 2941.24] I mean,
[2941.28 → 2941.82] if there could have been,
[2941.82 → 2942.80] any human being,
[2942.88 → 2943.78] walking this planet,
[2943.90 → 2945.12] that had swagger,
[2945.70 → 2946.52] it could have been Jesus.
[2946.52 → 2947.10] He's God,
[2947.16 → 2947.64] after all.
[2948.82 → 2949.88] But that's not,
[2950.08 → 2951.20] how he,
[2951.38 → 2952.52] chose to live.
[2953.84 → 2954.36] Notice,
[2954.80 → 2955.48] rather,
[2955.70 → 2956.14] that he,
[2956.28 → 2957.02] renounced,
[2957.72 → 2958.90] every privilege.
[2959.72 → 2960.62] He renounced,
[2960.74 → 2961.70] every advantage,
[2961.78 → 2963.16] that was rightfully his.
[2963.74 → 2964.34] And instead,
[2964.60 → 2965.88] he impoverished himself,
[2965.98 → 2966.92] in this exquisite,
[2967.10 → 2967.92] act of humility.
[2968.38 → 2969.76] He became nothing,
[2970.04 → 2970.60] Paul says.
[2972.16 → 2973.18] Now it's not,
[2973.30 → 2974.34] that he therefore,
[2974.60 → 2975.94] stopped being God.
[2976.52 → 2978.44] He didn't lose his Goddess.
[2979.82 → 2981.24] But it's as God,
[2981.32 → 2982.40] that's why Paul starts there,
[2982.44 → 2983.28] it's as God,
[2983.68 → 2984.26] that he,
[2984.44 → 2985.04] himself,
[2985.74 → 2986.82] poured out his life,
[2986.90 → 2987.88] for the sake of this world.
[2989.40 → 2990.40] He gave up,
[2990.48 → 2991.30] all the prerogatives,
[2991.40 → 2992.08] of being God.
[2993.58 → 2994.50] And as God,
[2994.54 → 2995.18] he took on,
[2996.78 → 2997.68] here's this word again,
[2997.74 → 2998.56] the very nature,
[2998.56 → 3000.68] of a servant.
[3000.68 → 3005.80] which is,
[3005.80 → 3006.94] a shocking,
[3007.32 → 3008.94] startling,
[3008.94 → 3009.76] claim.
[3010.98 → 3011.86] You see,
[3011.98 → 3012.18] what's,
[3012.22 → 3013.18] what's true of,
[3013.18 → 3014.16] of servants,
[3014.66 → 3015.52] in this,
[3015.92 → 3017.58] particular moment of history,
[3017.72 → 3018.86] this particular culture,
[3019.50 → 3021.30] is a servant,
[3021.42 → 3022.64] is somebody who has no rights,
[3023.18 → 3024.16] no legal standing,
[3024.70 → 3027.18] no privileges,
[3027.18 → 3030.08] no advantages,
[3031.40 → 3031.86] none.
[3034.28 → 3035.24] A servant's,
[3035.24 → 3036.80] vocation,
[3037.02 → 3038.56] is to serve other people.
[3041.56 → 3042.92] So do you see,
[3043.14 → 3044.92] what the God of the Bible,
[3045.12 → 3045.58] is like?
[3047.34 → 3047.94] Jesus,
[3048.30 → 3049.20] reveals,
[3049.70 → 3050.92] the very heart,
[3051.00 → 3051.90] of who God is,
[3052.86 → 3054.34] and what do we see?
[3054.34 → 3054.42] We see,
[3054.90 → 3057.60] we see a God,
[3057.74 → 3058.62] who has come,
[3058.92 → 3059.54] to us,
[3059.60 → 3060.74] not to be served,
[3061.66 → 3063.00] but to serve,
[3063.56 → 3065.40] not to take,
[3066.48 → 3068.08] but to give,
[3069.12 → 3070.16] not to hold on,
[3070.20 → 3070.76] to power,
[3071.94 → 3073.06] but to let go,
[3073.18 → 3073.62] of power,
[3074.62 → 3075.88] not to make his name,
[3075.96 → 3076.24] great,
[3076.36 → 3077.20] but to bring glory,
[3077.34 → 3078.04] to his father.
[3081.12 → 3082.82] And if we are to,
[3082.82 → 3084.58] find ourselves,
[3085.20 → 3086.00] as a people,
[3086.80 → 3087.42] who take,
[3087.66 → 3088.60] this word,
[3088.76 → 3089.16] as,
[3090.16 → 3091.00] the thing,
[3091.10 → 3091.86] that should be,
[3092.68 → 3093.78] what is primarily,
[3094.16 → 3094.48] forming,
[3094.70 → 3095.16] and shaping,
[3095.34 → 3096.28] our imaginations,
[3096.44 → 3097.06] of what it means,
[3097.14 → 3097.74] to be human.
[3101.10 → 3101.78] We'll get there,
[3101.82 → 3102.46] in a few minutes,
[3102.52 → 3103.38] about what this means,
[3103.46 → 3103.96] for our lives,
[3104.02 → 3104.82] but let me ask you,
[3104.94 → 3105.66] before we do,
[3108.00 → 3108.80] do you relate,
[3108.90 → 3109.34] to God,
[3109.46 → 3109.92] this way?
[3109.92 → 3110.12] Maybe,
[3110.12 → 3112.62] maybe if I,
[3112.74 → 3113.42] were to ask you,
[3113.48 → 3114.06] the question,
[3114.76 → 3116.16] tell me,
[3116.30 → 3116.92] what the God,
[3116.96 → 3117.48] of the Bible,
[3117.64 → 3118.14] is like,
[3119.50 → 3120.94] would,
[3121.10 → 3122.30] would you describe,
[3122.36 → 3122.94] it this way?
[3126.24 → 3126.70] Now,
[3126.74 → 3127.12] what is it,
[3127.92 → 3129.56] what does this look like,
[3129.64 → 3130.40] what does this mean,
[3130.54 → 3132.12] that the very heart,
[3132.20 → 3132.56] of God,
[3132.70 → 3133.64] is to serve?
[3135.30 → 3136.16] It's not,
[3136.30 → 3137.34] let's be really clear,
[3137.34 → 3138.82] it's not,
[3138.82 → 3139.64] a relationship,
[3139.64 → 3140.40] where God,
[3140.48 → 3141.38] is like a butler,
[3142.18 → 3144.96] we ring a bell,
[3145.18 → 3145.72] and he comes,
[3145.84 → 3146.88] and meets our needs,
[3147.48 → 3150.22] in fact,
[3150.30 → 3150.90] as a pastor,
[3151.04 → 3151.82] I've walked,
[3151.92 → 3152.32] with people,
[3152.48 → 3152.98] who've,
[3152.98 → 3154.46] picked up,
[3154.58 → 3155.20] that imagination,
[3155.20 → 3156.18] at some point,
[3156.34 → 3156.62] and,
[3156.74 → 3157.68] and their story,
[3157.84 → 3158.34] is littered,
[3158.38 → 3158.78] with God,
[3158.84 → 3159.70] disappointing them,
[3159.70 → 3163.10] in fact,
[3163.20 → 3163.34] yeah,
[3163.44 → 3164.32] if you relate,
[3164.44 → 3164.94] to God,
[3165.00 → 3166.04] as if he is there,
[3166.14 → 3167.26] to meet all of your needs,
[3167.28 → 3168.02] and expectations,
[3168.52 → 3169.98] you are setting yourself up,
[3170.06 → 3170.86] for profound,
[3171.16 → 3171.72] disappointment,
[3172.42 → 3175.74] because it's my experience,
[3175.80 → 3176.48] in my life,
[3176.52 → 3176.90] and also,
[3177.18 → 3177.74] as a pastor,
[3177.82 → 3178.34] for many years,
[3178.44 → 3179.58] that God,
[3179.66 → 3180.82] tends to frustrate that,
[3184.90 → 3185.86] so let's talk more,
[3185.94 → 3186.28] about that,
[3186.40 → 3186.66] I think,
[3186.82 → 3187.16] because I think,
[3187.22 → 3187.74] that's actually,
[3187.86 → 3188.92] where there's a clue here,
[3188.92 → 3190.06] of what this might look like,
[3190.08 → 3190.50] for us,
[3191.36 → 3191.64] let me,
[3191.68 → 3192.26] let me suggest,
[3192.26 → 3193.04] that you think of more,
[3193.08 → 3193.68] of it this way,
[3193.74 → 3194.88] every heartache,
[3195.00 → 3195.74] that you live with,
[3198.08 → 3198.98] can you be honest,
[3198.98 → 3199.46] with God,
[3199.54 → 3200.62] to name those heartaches,
[3201.66 → 3202.80] every disappointment,
[3203.10 → 3203.68] in your life,
[3205.02 → 3206.06] especially the ones,
[3206.20 → 3207.26] that you find,
[3207.82 → 3208.28] or you feel,
[3208.40 → 3209.16] that God is somehow,
[3209.30 → 3210.16] culpable for them,
[3210.88 → 3211.86] he let you down,
[3212.80 → 3214.90] life let you down,
[3215.00 → 3215.24] every,
[3215.36 → 3216.36] every wound,
[3216.48 → 3217.90] that has scarred you,
[3218.08 → 3218.78] through suffering,
[3219.80 → 3220.66] every loss,
[3221.48 → 3222.28] that weighs down,
[3222.36 → 3223.16] you're grieving soul,
[3223.26 → 3224.22] every frustration,
[3224.86 → 3225.94] that marks your life,
[3226.06 → 3227.52] every human struggle,
[3227.68 → 3228.46] you could imagine,
[3229.46 → 3230.74] and find yourself,
[3230.82 → 3231.62] in the midst of,
[3232.98 → 3236.98] you will discover,
[3237.28 → 3237.92] if you have eyes,
[3238.02 → 3239.02] to see a God,
[3239.12 → 3239.80] who is there,
[3240.36 → 3241.12] to serve you,
[3242.96 → 3243.80] a God,
[3243.94 → 3244.66] who has come,
[3244.74 → 3245.58] to humble himself,
[3245.58 → 3248.92] to walk with us,
[3248.98 → 3250.00] through the hardest things,
[3250.06 → 3251.28] that life throws at us,
[3251.32 → 3251.82] in fact,
[3252.52 → 3253.40] that's not just true,
[3253.52 → 3254.36] of this life,
[3255.12 → 3255.82] there's something,
[3255.98 → 3256.98] about this posture,
[3256.98 → 3257.70] of God,
[3257.78 → 3258.72] coming to serve,
[3258.82 → 3259.40] that will be true,
[3259.46 → 3260.20] of all eternity,
[3260.20 → 3263.66] we get the stunning vision,
[3264.00 → 3265.08] in the Gospel of Luke,
[3265.18 → 3266.04] chapter 12,
[3266.96 → 3267.76] verse 37,
[3267.96 → 3268.44] I think that,
[3268.50 → 3269.44] yeah that text is up there,
[3269.48 → 3270.06] I'm just going to read,
[3270.14 → 3270.62] from the screen,
[3270.72 → 3271.28] I didn't print it,
[3272.00 → 3272.96] it will be good,
[3273.66 → 3275.66] for those servants,
[3275.76 → 3276.40] whose master,
[3276.56 → 3277.84] finds them watching,
[3278.00 → 3278.82] when he comes,
[3279.98 → 3280.96] so Jesus teaching,
[3281.06 → 3281.56] his disciples,
[3281.70 → 3282.62] truly I tell you,
[3282.68 → 3283.76] he will dress himself,
[3283.76 → 3284.64] to serve,
[3285.14 → 3285.80] will have them,
[3285.80 → 3286.96] recline at the table,
[3287.08 → 3287.82] and will come,
[3287.92 → 3289.06] and wait on them,
[3290.62 → 3291.18] now I don't,
[3291.28 → 3291.76] we don't have time,
[3291.88 → 3294.08] to do a full exposition,
[3294.08 → 3295.08] of this text,
[3295.20 → 3296.02] but here's what,
[3296.62 → 3296.82] this,
[3297.46 → 3298.36] in the context,
[3298.36 → 3298.98] of Luke 12,
[3299.06 → 3299.98] you can go read it later,
[3300.32 → 3301.26] here's what this,
[3302.26 → 3302.98] teaching is,
[3303.02 → 3304.20] is saying to us,
[3304.22 → 3305.04] that when the master,
[3305.18 → 3305.64] returns,
[3305.74 → 3306.84] Jesus is talking about,
[3307.22 → 3308.26] himself returning,
[3308.26 → 3309.18] at the end of history,
[3310.18 → 3313.92] he will be dressed,
[3314.72 → 3315.30] to serve,
[3315.80 → 3317.26] it's an image,
[3317.50 → 3317.90] of this,
[3318.30 → 3319.18] and the Bible's filled,
[3319.28 → 3319.48] with these,
[3319.58 → 3320.54] I alluded to that,
[3320.64 → 3321.56] earlier when we came,
[3321.62 → 3322.08] to the table,
[3322.44 → 3323.20] the Bible's filled,
[3323.28 → 3323.84] with images,
[3323.98 → 3325.30] that at the end of history,
[3325.74 → 3326.58] what awaits us,
[3326.62 → 3327.84] is a lavish banquet,
[3327.98 → 3329.08] this is one of those texts,
[3330.22 → 3330.80] and notice,
[3331.08 → 3332.00] that the Lord,
[3332.16 → 3332.96] is not only the one,
[3333.02 → 3334.30] who prepares the feast,
[3336.30 → 3337.02] and the Lord,
[3337.10 → 3338.34] is not only the host,
[3338.34 → 3339.54] of the feast,
[3340.82 → 3341.68] but here,
[3342.42 → 3343.42] Jesus seems to be,
[3343.42 → 3344.74] suggesting that the Lord,
[3344.74 → 3344.78] Lord,
[3345.66 → 3346.82] as it were,
[3346.92 → 3348.06] will tuck in his robe,
[3348.98 → 3349.84] grab a towel,
[3351.02 → 3352.18] and wait upon us,
[3352.66 → 3354.22] to serve us,
[3355.66 → 3357.10] directing his infinite,
[3357.30 → 3358.18] and immense power,
[3358.68 → 3359.28] to heal,
[3359.50 → 3360.08] and cleanse,
[3360.24 → 3361.16] and bring joy,
[3361.64 → 3362.84] to satisfy us,
[3362.90 → 3363.42] imagine,
[3364.08 → 3365.00] that day,
[3365.12 → 3366.66] Jesus waiting upon you,
[3366.80 → 3368.06] bringing all his power,
[3368.20 → 3368.72] to bear,
[3368.80 → 3370.04] in order to serve you,
[3370.04 → 3373.72] and to set a table for you,
[3374.42 → 3375.76] where you will recline,
[3375.86 → 3376.76] and the Lord himself,
[3376.88 → 3377.74] will serve you,
[3378.50 → 3380.18] this is the heart of God,
[3380.26 → 3380.98] for his people,
[3381.18 → 3382.34] infinite love,
[3382.82 → 3383.74] a heart of service,
[3383.92 → 3385.10] love poured out,
[3385.34 → 3386.50] for our good,
[3386.58 → 3387.34] and for the life,
[3387.42 → 3388.08] of this world,
[3388.58 → 3390.38] for our present,
[3390.82 → 3392.02] and our future,
[3392.44 → 3392.82] delight,
[3392.82 → 3395.00] you see,
[3395.08 → 3396.18] the heart of God,
[3396.32 → 3397.32] is kind,
[3397.32 → 3400.94] and despite,
[3401.18 → 3402.14] what it might seem like,
[3402.20 → 3402.74] some days,
[3402.98 → 3404.54] we inhabit a world,
[3405.06 → 3406.46] in which ultimate reality,
[3406.70 → 3407.34] is gentle,
[3407.50 → 3408.20] is humble,
[3409.46 → 3410.26] poured out,
[3410.72 → 3411.54] to serve,
[3412.62 → 3413.84] and self-giving love,
[3415.70 → 3416.84] Paul continues,
[3417.54 → 3418.64] he's got more to say,
[3419.38 → 3420.86] becoming a human,
[3421.80 → 3422.14] Paul says,
[3422.24 → 3423.40] he humbled himself,
[3423.58 → 3424.00] he literally,
[3424.22 → 3424.66] this word means,
[3424.66 → 3426.22] he took the lowest place,
[3426.22 → 3428.04] in fact,
[3428.10 → 3429.00] his whole life,
[3429.16 → 3430.46] if you have eyes to see it,
[3430.48 → 3431.20] is one in which,
[3431.24 → 3431.92] he just kept,
[3432.04 → 3433.28] going downward,
[3434.12 → 3436.20] in his humility,
[3436.84 → 3438.34] think about it,
[3438.96 → 3440.34] just for a few moments,
[3440.44 → 3441.12] he's born,
[3442.66 → 3443.54] in a feed bin,
[3445.62 → 3446.60] cattle shed,
[3447.30 → 3449.80] his poor parents,
[3449.86 → 3450.80] go to the temple,
[3451.04 → 3452.22] for his dedication,
[3452.44 → 3453.48] they bring the smallest,
[3453.48 → 3454.90] sacrifice possible,
[3454.90 → 3455.92] that,
[3456.08 → 3457.06] for people in poverty,
[3457.84 → 3459.40] he's raised,
[3459.46 → 3460.52] by a poor family,
[3461.42 → 3462.76] in a backwoods' community,
[3463.36 → 3465.04] his whole life,
[3465.50 → 3466.08] he's poor,
[3466.68 → 3467.62] we might even say,
[3467.70 → 3468.74] he's homeless,
[3470.42 → 3471.62] foxes have holes,
[3471.90 → 3472.84] birds have nests,
[3472.96 → 3473.56] the son of man,
[3473.64 → 3474.46] has no place,
[3474.54 → 3475.24] to lay his head,
[3475.28 → 3475.68] he said,
[3476.42 → 3477.74] he enters Jerusalem,
[3477.92 → 3478.96] on a borrowed donkey,
[3479.72 → 3481.28] he has his last meal,
[3481.28 → 3482.38] in a borrowed room,
[3482.38 → 3483.82] he's buried,
[3483.94 → 3485.02] in a borrowed grave,
[3485.44 → 3486.88] he dies naked,
[3488.06 → 3489.42] he had little,
[3489.60 → 3490.48] that the world valued,
[3490.78 → 3491.86] and the little he had,
[3491.90 → 3492.80] was taken away,
[3493.28 → 3494.34] he was discarded,
[3494.52 → 3495.26] and thrown away,
[3495.56 → 3496.36] he died outside,
[3496.50 → 3497.16] the city gates,
[3497.24 → 3497.74] in shame,
[3499.34 → 3500.24] and the climax,
[3501.22 → 3501.62] this is where,
[3501.84 → 3502.58] Paul finally goes,
[3502.64 → 3503.12] the climax,
[3503.36 → 3504.24] of this humility,
[3504.80 → 3505.68] was an obedience,
[3505.94 → 3506.90] that went all the way,
[3506.98 → 3507.72] to the point,
[3507.72 → 3509.56] of a scandalous death,
[3509.60 → 3510.96] on a shame filled cross,
[3511.68 → 3515.38] we can lose,
[3515.50 → 3516.34] the shock of that,
[3516.94 → 3518.22] but let me just remind us,
[3518.26 → 3519.52] as one commentator put it,
[3520.22 → 3520.74] nobody,
[3521.58 → 3522.20] in the city,
[3522.30 → 3523.04] that this letter,
[3523.12 → 3523.50] is written to,
[3523.56 → 3524.52] the city of Philippi,
[3524.66 → 3525.50] nobody's walking,
[3525.72 → 3526.34] through this city,
[3526.96 → 3528.32] with a gold cross,
[3528.76 → 3529.60] around their neck,
[3530.22 → 3532.42] or a gold cross,
[3532.50 → 3533.76] embossed on their Bible,
[3534.56 → 3535.60] I'm not suggesting,
[3535.78 → 3536.48] those are bad things,
[3536.56 → 3537.42] don't hear me that way,
[3537.72 → 3539.16] but the point is,
[3539.64 → 3540.94] culturally,
[3541.10 → 3541.66] at this moment,
[3541.74 → 3542.22] in history,
[3542.60 → 3543.94] this is utterly,
[3543.94 → 3544.64] vile,
[3544.84 → 3545.46] and shameful,
[3547.58 → 3547.92] Jewish,
[3548.18 → 3549.08] in Jewish law,
[3549.16 → 3550.14] if you died on a cross,
[3550.20 → 3550.88] it meant one thing,
[3551.16 → 3551.52] clearly,
[3551.72 → 3552.86] you were under God's curse,
[3553.78 → 3554.76] and in polite,
[3554.88 → 3555.72] Roman society,
[3555.84 → 3556.54] you didn't talk,
[3556.60 → 3557.28] you did not utter,
[3557.38 → 3558.68] the word for cross,
[3560.10 → 3560.96] you might,
[3561.12 → 3563.56] have a conversation,
[3563.90 → 3565.20] and allude,
[3565.28 → 3565.82] to the fact,
[3565.94 → 3566.86] that some criminals,
[3567.14 → 3567.28] were,
[3567.72 → 3569.64] died outside the city,
[3569.74 → 3570.68] but you just would,
[3571.06 → 3571.56] you go,
[3572.52 → 3573.80] you might go really close,
[3573.88 → 3574.72] but you just wouldn't say,
[3574.80 → 3575.70] the word cross,
[3576.18 → 3578.78] it was that,
[3578.94 → 3579.80] shameful,
[3580.04 → 3580.54] and vile,
[3581.62 → 3581.98] and yet,
[3582.04 → 3583.54] consistent with how he lived,
[3584.50 → 3585.76] the cross reveals,
[3585.76 → 3588.80] what God is like,
[3588.80 → 3590.32] the Christian God,
[3590.72 → 3591.82] the God of the Bible,
[3591.92 → 3594.22] is a God of self-giving love,
[3594.28 → 3595.20] it's why he came,
[3595.20 → 3600.18] and there's many people today,
[3600.18 → 3602.28] that have a hard time,
[3602.32 → 3603.70] believing the God of the Bible,
[3605.04 → 3605.76] in fact,
[3605.84 → 3606.68] many Canadians,
[3606.90 → 3607.64] especially I would say,
[3607.72 → 3608.84] Western Canadians,
[3609.54 → 3611.02] we have our own unique stuff,
[3611.14 → 3612.28] but the God of the Bible,
[3613.28 → 3614.08] rubs many,
[3615.20 → 3616.26] the wrong way,
[3616.90 → 3618.36] rubs against our assumptions,
[3619.30 → 3620.28] our expectations,
[3620.28 → 3621.70] of what God's,
[3621.70 → 3622.58] should be like,
[3623.24 → 3626.74] and this passage,
[3626.74 → 3627.54] invites us,
[3627.62 → 3628.16] to do,
[3628.48 → 3628.76] what,
[3628.94 → 3629.76] what was difficult,
[3629.76 → 3630.68] in Paul's day,
[3630.80 → 3631.00] what,
[3631.06 → 3632.24] what remains difficult,
[3632.24 → 3633.08] in our day,
[3633.08 → 3635.72] it invites us,
[3635.72 → 3636.88] to start with Jesus,
[3636.88 → 3639.86] and to rethink,
[3639.86 → 3640.68] our whole picture,
[3640.68 → 3641.56] of who God is,
[3641.58 → 3642.46] around this picture,
[3642.46 → 3642.98] of Jesus,
[3643.20 → 3643.90] you want to know,
[3644.00 → 3645.06] what the God of the Bible is,
[3645.18 → 3645.78] start here,
[3646.66 → 3647.96] start with Jesus,
[3648.60 → 3650.46] allow Jesus,
[3650.46 → 3651.28] to show us,
[3651.28 → 3652.44] what the God of the Bible,
[3652.64 → 3653.04] is like,
[3654.08 → 3654.48] this,
[3655.08 → 3656.26] this is the way,
[3657.86 → 3660.52] secondly,
[3660.74 → 3662.16] and don't worry,
[3662.22 → 3662.82] my first point,
[3662.88 → 3664.18] was by far the longest,
[3664.18 → 3666.92] we see,
[3667.08 → 3667.96] what the Christian life,
[3668.10 → 3668.96] is also like,
[3670.30 → 3671.42] so we don't just see,
[3671.58 → 3672.66] what the God of the Bible,
[3672.82 → 3673.04] is like,
[3673.08 → 3674.32] we see what this Christian life,
[3674.36 → 3675.34] is supposed to be about,
[3675.64 → 3676.54] here I have in mind,
[3676.60 → 3677.20] verse five,
[3677.30 → 3678.50] where Paul just simply says,
[3678.64 → 3679.20] your attitude,
[3679.56 → 3680.72] should be the same,
[3680.80 → 3681.92] as that of Christ Jesus,
[3682.04 → 3683.26] now let me just remind you,
[3683.38 → 3684.66] hopefully you've heard this before,
[3685.38 → 3685.98] if not,
[3686.08 → 3686.36] let me,
[3686.44 → 3687.38] let me help you,
[3687.50 → 3689.08] that often in the Bible,
[3689.32 → 3690.12] this word you,
[3690.76 → 3691.52] is plural,
[3692.28 → 3693.66] so Paul is saying,
[3693.66 → 3694.52] you all,
[3695.24 → 3696.08] as a community,
[3696.88 → 3697.40] should,
[3698.44 → 3699.64] have the same attitude,
[3700.04 → 3701.04] as Christ,
[3701.16 → 3702.44] sometimes this has been called,
[3702.84 → 3703.60] this invitation,
[3703.78 → 3705.36] to imitate Christ,
[3705.96 → 3708.86] and that shouldn't surprise us,
[3709.12 → 3709.46] really,
[3710.40 → 3710.76] I mean,
[3710.82 → 3712.72] if this is the God,
[3712.84 → 3713.64] that we are,
[3713.82 → 3714.68] as Paul will put it,
[3714.74 → 3715.76] many times in his letters,
[3715.84 → 3717.22] that we are united to,
[3718.80 → 3720.46] it's a common phrase for Paul,
[3720.52 → 3721.14] to be a Christian,
[3721.26 → 3722.66] is to be united to Jesus,
[3722.66 → 3724.08] to be one,
[3724.32 → 3724.96] with Christ,
[3725.58 → 3726.56] if that's true,
[3726.66 → 3727.58] then it would follow,
[3727.94 → 3728.58] it would seem,
[3728.66 → 3728.80] right,
[3728.88 → 3729.04] that,
[3729.26 → 3730.92] that the one we're united to,
[3731.00 → 3731.60] should be the one,
[3731.66 → 3732.68] that we should live like,
[3733.16 → 3736.46] or to use another image,
[3736.52 → 3737.34] that Paul will use,
[3737.42 → 3737.56] that,
[3737.72 → 3739.10] that God is the one,
[3739.58 → 3740.28] who's,
[3740.44 → 3741.24] in whose image,
[3741.34 → 3742.14] we've been made,
[3742.50 → 3744.96] and Jesus has come,
[3745.00 → 3746.16] as the perfect human,
[3746.68 → 3747.44] you want to know,
[3747.50 → 3748.26] what God intends,
[3748.34 → 3749.12] for human life,
[3750.18 → 3751.08] study the life,
[3751.08 → 3751.54] of Jesus,
[3752.08 → 3754.54] he came to renew,
[3754.54 → 3755.96] God's image in us,
[3756.96 → 3757.16] in fact,
[3757.24 → 3758.00] Paul puts it this way,
[3758.04 → 3758.32] in Romans,
[3758.44 → 3759.58] he's the start,
[3759.66 → 3760.98] of a new humanity,
[3761.82 → 3763.08] a new way,
[3763.16 → 3763.92] of being human,
[3764.92 → 3766.04] is opened up,
[3766.18 → 3766.68] through the life,
[3766.74 → 3767.26] of Jesus,
[3768.06 → 3770.80] this is the kind of life,
[3771.30 → 3772.16] human life,
[3772.66 → 3773.70] that God intends,
[3773.82 → 3774.70] for all humans,
[3776.20 → 3777.38] imagine a world,
[3777.54 → 3777.86] like that,
[3777.86 → 3779.10] a life,
[3779.10 → 3780.94] of selfless love,
[3781.74 → 3782.60] a life,
[3782.68 → 3783.66] of giving up power,
[3784.32 → 3785.28] and being poured out,
[3785.38 → 3785.96] in weakness,
[3786.50 → 3787.04] a life,
[3787.14 → 3787.62] of giving,
[3787.76 → 3788.42] and not taking,
[3788.54 → 3788.82] a life,
[3788.88 → 3789.44] of serving,
[3789.56 → 3790.60] and not being served,
[3791.02 → 3792.08] a servant form,
[3792.14 → 3792.72] of life,
[3792.76 → 3793.56] in which we give up,
[3793.72 → 3794.06] rights,
[3794.16 → 3794.80] and privileges,
[3795.10 → 3795.86] and advantages,
[3796.64 → 3797.94] to be poured out,
[3798.06 → 3798.58] for the sake,
[3798.64 → 3799.28] of this world,
[3799.82 → 3802.18] that's,
[3802.32 → 3803.66] what God intends,
[3803.76 → 3804.36] for human life,
[3804.46 → 3805.24] Jesus shows us,
[3805.32 → 3805.66] the way,
[3805.66 → 3808.88] you see,
[3808.96 → 3809.36] you don't,
[3810.08 → 3811.54] you don't get to follow,
[3811.82 → 3812.92] after Jesus,
[3813.68 → 3815.14] and then hang on,
[3815.22 → 3816.34] to your way of life,
[3816.78 → 3819.78] it's not an option,
[3819.78 → 3820.64] that's left open,
[3820.64 → 3821.22] to us,
[3821.70 → 3821.94] in fact,
[3822.00 → 3822.90] what does Jesus say,
[3823.84 → 3824.50] whoever tries,
[3824.58 → 3825.92] to keep their life,
[3826.24 → 3826.90] will lose it,
[3827.90 → 3829.62] but whoever loses,
[3829.62 → 3830.62] their life,
[3830.66 → 3831.40] or gives it up,
[3831.46 → 3832.18] for my sake,
[3832.32 → 3833.46] will find it,
[3833.54 → 3834.22] will keep it,
[3834.22 → 3836.66] this,
[3836.82 → 3837.58] this is the way,
[3838.52 → 3842.20] we were not,
[3843.24 → 3843.78] contrary,
[3843.94 → 3844.66] let me put back up,
[3844.74 → 3845.42] contrary,
[3845.42 → 3846.66] to the stories,
[3846.98 → 3848.68] that are narrated,
[3848.82 → 3849.56] in our culture,
[3849.94 → 3850.88] that form us,
[3851.16 → 3852.22] form our imaginations,
[3853.08 → 3853.76] give us,
[3853.90 → 3854.40] visions,
[3854.48 → 3855.62] of what the good life is,
[3857.50 → 3858.14] saturated,
[3858.44 → 3859.40] by it all the time,
[3861.06 → 3861.50] contrary,
[3861.74 → 3862.46] to those images,
[3862.82 → 3863.62] to those messages,
[3863.62 → 3865.72] that are trying so hard,
[3865.78 → 3866.68] to form us,
[3867.36 → 3868.42] we were not made,
[3868.52 → 3868.96] to hoard,
[3871.08 → 3872.38] we were not made,
[3872.48 → 3873.28] to accumulate,
[3874.00 → 3876.56] we were not made,
[3876.56 → 3877.44] to spend,
[3877.56 → 3878.18] the majority,
[3878.18 → 3879.06] of our resources,
[3879.06 → 3879.66] exclusively,
[3879.66 → 3880.52] on ourselves,
[3881.02 → 3882.92] we were not made,
[3883.00 → 3883.56] to increase,
[3883.68 → 3884.48] our own comfort,
[3884.64 → 3885.34] at the expense,
[3885.40 → 3886.06] of others,
[3886.30 → 3887.24] we were not made,
[3887.32 → 3888.54] to cocoon ourselves,
[3888.64 → 3889.52] in isolation,
[3889.52 → 3891.46] and watch,
[3891.46 → 3892.56] a suffering world,
[3893.38 → 3894.18] and do nothing,
[3894.18 → 3894.92] about it,
[3895.42 → 3897.08] how,
[3897.26 → 3898.46] how could we,
[3899.12 → 3899.90] live that way,
[3900.74 → 3901.50] if this is,
[3901.50 → 3904.16] what God is like,
[3904.16 → 3907.04] I'm so thankful,
[3907.04 → 3907.50] that early,
[3907.56 → 3908.60] in my own formation,
[3908.60 → 3909.62] as a young believer,
[3910.66 → 3911.48] I came across,
[3911.54 → 3911.88] a book,
[3911.94 → 3912.64] that just shaped,
[3912.74 → 3913.42] my imagination,
[3913.88 → 3914.74] the author's name,
[3914.82 → 3915.64] is Tom Sign,
[3916.50 → 3917.58] I actually had the privilege,
[3917.58 → 3918.20] of meeting him,
[3918.24 → 3918.98] a couple of years ago,
[3920.10 → 3920.86] he was residing,
[3920.96 → 3921.62] north of Seattle,
[3922.62 → 3923.96] he wrote a book,
[3924.02 → 3924.42] entitled,
[3924.60 → 3925.92] why settle for more,
[3926.62 → 3927.88] and miss the best,
[3927.88 → 3930.84] very challenging book,
[3931.40 → 3931.68] so,
[3932.00 → 3932.74] if you're curious,
[3932.88 → 3933.54] you go look it up,
[3933.98 → 3934.64] I warned you,
[3934.72 → 3935.56] that you're going to be challenged,
[3935.80 → 3937.54] but what he does,
[3937.58 → 3938.10] in this book,
[3938.16 → 3938.82] is he challenges,
[3938.82 → 3939.54] the dominant,
[3939.54 → 3940.74] North American narrative,
[3941.46 → 3942.42] I'm a Gen Her,
[3942.94 → 3943.74] and so I was,
[3944.08 → 3945.28] raised to believe,
[3946.02 → 3947.02] and to strive,
[3947.28 → 3948.54] to produce more,
[3948.80 → 3949.42] than my parents,
[3949.48 → 3950.36] to have a larger home,
[3950.84 → 3952.12] a more successful career,
[3952.52 → 3953.32] nicer holidays,
[3953.82 → 3955.28] and I bought into that,
[3955.40 → 3955.96] early on,
[3956.38 → 3957.40] like that's the good life,
[3957.88 → 3959.20] upward mobility,
[3959.88 → 3962.36] now I'm a parent,
[3962.48 → 3963.34] of millennials,
[3963.66 → 3964.26] and Gen Z,
[3964.50 → 3966.26] that is not,
[3966.38 → 3966.94] their imagination,
[3966.94 → 3967.66] right now,
[3968.02 → 3969.10] praise the Lord,
[3969.20 → 3969.52] for that,
[3969.60 → 3970.38] that's another sermon,
[3970.94 → 3971.12] but,
[3971.20 → 3972.80] but that was the narrative,
[3972.92 → 3973.38] I was told,
[3974.32 → 3974.96] and I think a lot,
[3975.00 → 3975.58] in my generation,
[3976.66 → 3977.74] I came across this book,
[3977.78 → 3978.58] and he's challenging,
[3978.58 → 3979.10] that narrative,
[3979.20 → 3979.48] and says,
[3979.68 → 3980.86] he's inviting followers,
[3980.86 → 3981.34] of Jesus,
[3981.44 → 3982.22] in North America,
[3982.86 → 3983.00] to,
[3983.08 → 3983.36] to,
[3983.48 → 3984.88] to rather get drawn,
[3984.96 → 3985.78] by a narrative,
[3985.78 → 3987.14] of downward mobility,
[3987.14 → 3988.86] on purpose,
[3989.42 → 3991.54] spend less,
[3991.54 → 3992.54] on yourself,
[3992.72 → 3993.54] give away more,
[3994.16 → 3995.00] give away more,
[3995.08 → 3995.64] of your time,
[3995.76 → 3996.64] more of your finances,
[3996.80 → 3997.68] more of your energy,
[3998.20 → 4000.68] eventually started,
[4000.78 → 4001.36] an organization,
[4001.52 → 4002.60] called the mustard seed,
[4002.70 → 4003.38] organization,
[4004.14 → 4005.46] it's done so much,
[4005.52 → 4006.28] good around the world,
[4007.60 → 4008.54] and I wasn't,
[4008.62 → 4009.02] passioned,
[4009.06 → 4009.90] by that imagination,
[4010.04 → 4010.60] I still am,
[4010.64 → 4011.20] as you can tell,
[4011.20 → 4013.48] but friends,
[4013.54 → 4014.38] if we're to allow,
[4014.52 → 4015.38] the biblical story,
[4016.02 → 4016.64] to shape,
[4016.94 → 4017.68] our identities,
[4018.28 → 4020.14] to give direction,
[4020.14 → 4021.12] to our lives,
[4021.48 → 4022.82] to be,
[4022.96 → 4024.24] the primary clue,
[4024.34 → 4025.54] to how we ought to live,
[4025.60 → 4026.20] as humans,
[4026.86 → 4027.80] what God's intentions,
[4027.80 → 4028.64] for life are,
[4029.14 → 4029.96] how could it be,
[4030.06 → 4030.46] any different,
[4030.60 → 4030.88] this is,
[4031.14 → 4031.40] you know,
[4031.44 → 4031.86] it's Jesus,
[4031.86 → 4032.98] who says to each one,
[4033.00 → 4033.74] of us this morning,
[4033.88 → 4034.26] come,
[4034.74 → 4035.62] and be with me,
[4035.84 → 4036.66] yes,
[4038.20 → 4038.86] he doesn't let us,
[4039.02 → 4039.34] stay there,
[4039.34 → 4041.32] come and follow me,
[4042.88 → 4044.16] take up your cross,
[4045.34 → 4047.42] as I sometimes say,
[4047.50 → 4048.40] to young couples,
[4049.04 → 4050.48] who are getting married,
[4051.70 → 4052.62] as I did a few months,
[4052.78 → 4053.44] a month ago,
[4053.58 → 4054.46] and was doing a wedding,
[4054.54 → 4055.60] for a niece of mine,
[4056.42 → 4057.34] the invitation really,
[4057.48 → 4058.24] is come and die,
[4059.24 → 4060.42] come and die to yourself,
[4062.46 → 4063.38] that's what it means,
[4063.44 → 4064.44] to take up our cross,
[4064.98 → 4066.02] follow after Jesus,
[4067.12 → 4068.38] follow his path,
[4068.38 → 4070.46] of downward humility,
[4071.28 → 4072.14] follow me,
[4072.24 → 4072.90] Jesus is saying,
[4073.00 → 4073.56] on taking on,
[4073.60 → 4074.52] the nature of servants,
[4074.82 → 4075.70] giving up your privilege,
[4075.78 → 4076.24] and power,
[4076.34 → 4077.26] for the sake of others,
[4078.74 → 4079.02] and friends,
[4079.06 → 4080.58] if we take this text seriously,
[4081.50 → 4083.58] we are led,
[4083.66 → 4084.18] to see,
[4084.40 → 4085.10] it seems to me,
[4085.14 → 4086.02] our desperate need,
[4086.08 → 4086.86] for God's grace,
[4086.92 → 4088.10] to renew our hearts,
[4088.92 → 4089.72] this story,
[4089.72 → 4090.60] of the Bible,
[4091.60 → 4093.22] is trying so hard,
[4093.34 → 4094.98] to form us,
[4095.06 → 4095.72] in a culture,
[4095.84 → 4096.58] that's forming us,
[4096.62 → 4097.80] in so many different ways,
[4097.80 → 4100.06] this is not natural,
[4100.06 → 4101.20] for us,
[4101.66 → 4102.42] to take on,
[4103.00 → 4103.78] a servant like,
[4104.44 → 4104.94] life,
[4105.16 → 4105.74] and attitude,
[4107.30 → 4108.38] and it's not just natural,
[4108.52 → 4108.92] it's not,
[4109.04 → 4110.42] it's not natural,
[4110.66 → 4111.00] in part,
[4111.08 → 4111.18] yeah,
[4111.26 → 4112.32] because of the culture,
[4112.44 → 4113.24] we're inhabiting,
[4113.36 → 4113.98] but it's also,
[4113.98 → 4114.86] not natural,
[4114.86 → 4115.74] because of what sin,
[4115.74 → 4116.48] likes to do,
[4117.64 → 4118.52] there's a wisdom,
[4118.52 → 4119.14] there's wisdom,
[4119.28 → 4119.76] in the tradition,
[4119.76 → 4120.46] of the church,
[4120.72 → 4121.34] ancient wisdom,
[4121.34 → 4122.62] that talks about sin,
[4122.70 → 4123.48] as this power,
[4123.60 → 4125.04] that takes our souls,
[4125.14 → 4126.26] and curves them inward,
[4126.26 → 4129.74] I don't know Latin,
[4130.04 → 4131.06] I won't bore you,
[4131.18 → 4131.92] with a Latin phrase,
[4132.04 → 4132.66] but there's a phrase,
[4132.74 → 4133.20] for this about,
[4133.40 → 4134.40] and it's simply translated,
[4134.54 → 4135.84] the curvature of the soul,
[4136.90 → 4137.46] that sin,
[4137.54 → 4138.42] just curves us,
[4138.42 → 4139.10] all inward,
[4139.64 → 4140.62] to think of ourselves,
[4141.32 → 4142.56] to prioritize ourselves,
[4142.74 → 4143.44] our own comfort,
[4143.54 → 4144.28] our own protection,
[4144.84 → 4146.42] and what God's grace,
[4146.50 → 4147.30] in Jesus Christ,
[4147.60 → 4149.14] can do in our lives,
[4149.28 → 4150.60] is break the power,
[4150.70 → 4151.14] of sin,
[4151.98 → 4152.84] Jesus nailed it,
[4152.88 → 4153.56] to the cross,
[4154.10 → 4154.92] and sets us free,
[4154.98 → 4155.82] we sang about that,
[4155.88 → 4156.34] this morning,
[4156.46 → 4157.04] I'm free,
[4157.86 → 4158.56] and in part,
[4158.66 → 4159.44] I'm free to serve,
[4159.56 → 4160.34] I'm free to allow,
[4160.42 → 4160.96] God's grace,
[4161.04 → 4162.42] to untwist my soul,
[4162.88 → 4163.48] that it would be,
[4163.56 → 4165.06] shaped outward again,
[4165.56 → 4166.08] that it would be,
[4166.30 → 4167.20] more natural again,
[4167.26 → 4167.58] for me,
[4167.66 → 4168.70] to think of others,
[4169.22 → 4170.24] and how I can serve,
[4170.34 → 4171.12] and how I can give up,
[4171.16 → 4171.68] my privilege,
[4171.78 → 4172.42] and my power,
[4172.54 → 4173.46] for the sake of others,
[4173.54 → 4174.22] who don't have it,
[4175.18 → 4176.32] this is the way,
[4176.32 → 4180.00] finally,
[4180.32 → 4181.86] and where I want us to end,
[4183.30 → 4184.12] sometimes this text,
[4184.20 → 4185.38] show us what God is like,
[4185.40 → 4186.46] and what the Christian life,
[4186.56 → 4186.84] is like,
[4186.88 → 4188.10] it shows us where the history,
[4188.10 → 4189.10] of the world is headed,
[4189.88 → 4190.76] I know that's a bold,
[4190.84 → 4191.92] and audacious claim to make,
[4192.00 → 4193.34] but that's what the text claims,
[4194.56 → 4196.88] notice with me,
[4197.80 → 4198.62] I'm thinking of verses,
[4198.74 → 4199.42] 9 through 11,
[4199.98 → 4201.02] because of the way,
[4201.02 → 4201.78] Jesus came,
[4202.92 → 4203.64] poured out,
[4204.28 → 4205.64] this one who becomes nothing,
[4206.32 → 4208.00] because of the way,
[4208.12 → 4208.76] he dies,
[4208.88 → 4209.28] obedient,
[4209.76 → 4210.94] even to the point,
[4211.00 → 4212.30] of a shameful death,
[4212.34 → 4213.02] on a cross,
[4213.10 → 4213.96] because of all of,
[4214.06 → 4214.90] what Paul has said,
[4214.98 → 4216.34] in verses 5 through 8,
[4216.88 → 4217.32] therefore,
[4217.74 → 4218.28] verse 9,
[4219.44 → 4220.40] Jesus is now,
[4220.46 → 4221.94] exalted as Lord,
[4224.08 → 4225.36] in other words,
[4225.50 → 4226.88] Jesus truly reveals,
[4227.00 → 4228.00] the nature of God,
[4228.12 → 4229.62] so God gives Jesus,
[4229.82 → 4230.72] his own name,
[4231.34 → 4231.68] Lord,
[4232.58 → 4233.94] the divine name,
[4233.94 → 4235.86] the name,
[4235.86 → 4237.34] that no Jewish person,
[4237.50 → 4238.34] would dare utter,
[4239.28 → 4240.30] the name Yahweh,
[4241.10 → 4242.86] that's,
[4243.04 → 4244.02] the great name,
[4244.10 → 4245.28] that God has given Jesus,
[4245.50 → 4245.98] Yahweh,
[4246.44 → 4246.82] Lord,
[4248.24 → 4250.02] exalted to the highest place,
[4250.22 → 4250.70] Paul says,
[4251.26 → 4251.88] the one,
[4252.08 → 4252.80] who came,
[4252.88 → 4254.12] and took the lowest place,
[4254.12 → 4256.48] one day,
[4256.56 → 4256.96] he says,
[4257.04 → 4258.40] every knee will bow,
[4258.50 → 4259.12] and acknowledge,
[4259.24 → 4259.74] that Jesus,
[4260.18 → 4260.54] Lord,
[4261.16 → 4262.66] God's great promise,
[4262.80 → 4263.92] in Isaiah 45,
[4264.22 → 4265.64] is finally going to come true,
[4266.08 → 4266.98] I think there's a slide,
[4267.04 → 4267.64] with this text,
[4267.70 → 4268.38] if I remember right,
[4269.68 → 4271.58] this is what Isaiah prophesied,
[4271.58 → 4273.12] turn to me,
[4273.16 → 4273.94] and be saved,
[4274.04 → 4275.34] all you ends of the earth,
[4275.42 → 4276.40] for I am God,
[4276.50 → 4277.56] there is no other,
[4278.30 → 4279.12] by myself,
[4279.24 → 4279.98] I have sworn,
[4280.40 → 4281.60] my mouth has uttered,
[4281.64 → 4282.58] in all integrity,
[4282.78 → 4283.30] a word,
[4283.50 → 4284.60] that will not be revoked,
[4284.70 → 4285.30] before me,
[4285.36 → 4286.30] every knee will bow,
[4287.08 → 4287.60] by me,
[4287.66 → 4288.86] every tongue will swear,
[4288.98 → 4289.74] they will say of me,
[4289.82 → 4290.28] the Lord,
[4290.52 → 4291.54] in the Lord alone,
[4291.66 → 4292.44] are deliverance,
[4292.48 → 4293.12] and strength,
[4293.42 → 4294.56] all who've raged,
[4294.56 → 4295.20] against him,
[4295.24 → 4296.00] will come to him,
[4296.06 → 4297.20] and be put to shame,
[4298.20 → 4298.78] do you see,
[4298.92 → 4299.90] where history is headed,
[4299.90 → 4303.18] the God,
[4303.28 → 4304.46] who poured himself out,
[4304.56 → 4305.62] in love for this world,
[4305.74 → 4306.96] returning in power,
[4308.48 → 4309.28] bringing this world,
[4309.36 → 4310.42] back to life again,
[4310.66 → 4311.64] healing and restoring,
[4311.78 → 4312.72] all that's broken,
[4313.20 → 4314.24] making all the things,
[4314.32 → 4314.88] that are sad,
[4314.94 → 4315.66] no longer true,
[4315.82 → 4316.74] wiping every tear,
[4316.84 → 4317.76] from our eyes,
[4319.76 → 4321.28] a glorious day,
[4321.34 → 4322.02] in which every,
[4322.84 → 4324.16] tongue will confess,
[4325.30 → 4326.18] there's one God,
[4327.16 → 4328.18] there's one Lord,
[4328.24 → 4329.16] his name is Jesus,
[4329.90 → 4331.24] and remember,
[4331.24 → 4331.78] that image,
[4331.90 → 4332.66] from Luke 12,
[4333.44 → 4336.26] a banquet table,
[4336.36 → 4337.22] that God himself,
[4337.38 → 4338.00] will spread,
[4338.88 → 4339.86] gathering a people,
[4340.06 → 4340.90] from every tribe,
[4341.54 → 4342.26] language group,
[4342.74 → 4343.40] every culture,
[4343.52 → 4344.58] nation under heaven,
[4346.00 → 4347.38] the descending God,
[4347.46 → 4348.10] who's exalted,
[4348.22 → 4349.00] to the highest place,
[4349.14 → 4349.92] once again,
[4350.04 → 4351.28] descending in love,
[4351.38 → 4352.12] to serve,
[4352.64 → 4353.72] those that he gathers,
[4353.80 → 4355.02] around his banquet table,
[4355.10 → 4355.72] on that day,
[4356.92 → 4357.38] this,
[4357.88 → 4358.72] is the way,
[4358.72 → 4363.02] keeping this text,
[4363.64 → 4365.50] before our imaginations,
[4367.12 → 4368.04] reorients us,
[4368.12 → 4369.14] to what the Christian life,
[4369.26 → 4369.82] should be about,
[4370.88 → 4371.88] reminds us,
[4371.88 → 4372.74] of whom the God,
[4372.78 → 4373.90] of the Bible is,
[4374.90 → 4377.22] and keeps our hope alive,
[4378.22 → 4379.12] and we're living,
[4379.32 → 4379.92] at a time,
[4380.36 → 4380.76] one of the things,
[4380.84 → 4381.64] we could say again,
[4381.68 → 4382.42] about this moment,
[4382.42 → 4384.02] is hope,
[4384.02 → 4385.08] for the future,
[4385.76 → 4388.88] is at all time loads,
[4389.42 → 4391.42] not just,
[4391.62 → 4392.68] as I listen to my kids,
[4392.74 → 4393.42] and their generation,
[4393.52 → 4394.26] not just the hope,
[4394.32 → 4394.98] of homeownership,
[4395.18 → 4396.12] which seems like a
[4396.12 → 4397.70] a dream,
[4399.26 → 4399.94] but the hope,
[4400.06 → 4400.56] for the planet,
[4401.96 → 4402.60] the hope,
[4402.70 → 4403.40] for justice,
[4404.40 → 4404.96] the hope,
[4405.06 → 4405.70] for sanity,
[4406.10 → 4406.74] some days,
[4406.74 → 4410.28] and I'll,
[4410.40 → 4411.50] be the first to admit,
[4412.54 → 4414.38] I struggle,
[4414.50 → 4414.98] to hold out,
[4415.12 → 4416.32] hold on to hope myself,
[4416.72 → 4417.38] maybe some of you,
[4417.48 → 4417.84] can relate,
[4419.20 → 4420.72] but a text like this,
[4420.76 → 4421.52] not only shows us,
[4421.56 → 4422.14] who God is,
[4422.24 → 4422.64] what it means,
[4422.70 → 4423.30] to follow him,
[4423.36 → 4423.62] but it,
[4423.86 → 4425.24] keeps hoping alive,
[4425.24 → 4425.96] in our hearts,
[4427.02 → 4427.88] reminds us,
[4429.08 → 4429.84] that all is not,
[4429.92 → 4430.52] what it seems,
[4431.46 → 4432.28] there is a God,
[4432.58 → 4433.48] who's been exalted,
[4433.62 → 4434.46] to the highest place,
[4434.56 → 4435.50] ruling over history,
[4435.50 → 4436.38] one day,
[4436.46 → 4437.14] he's returning,
[4437.28 → 4437.92] as king,
[4438.92 → 4440.10] and no power,
[4440.22 → 4440.96] will defy him,
[4441.06 → 4442.00] every knee will bow,
[4442.38 → 4443.14] every power,
[4443.32 → 4443.80] will submit,
[4444.64 → 4447.60] and we will enjoy,
[4447.68 → 4448.54] the most lavish,
[4448.86 → 4449.22] banquet,
[4450.22 → 4451.22] with Jesus himself,
[4451.34 → 4452.02] serving us,
[4453.48 → 4454.40] what a day,
[4454.90 → 4455.70] that we live for,
[4455.96 → 4456.42] in hope,
[4456.48 → 4457.18] and expectation,
[4457.92 → 4458.14] friends,
[4458.26 → 4458.52] this,
[4459.38 → 4460.36] this is the way,
[4460.98 → 4461.78] let me pray,
[4462.78 → 4465.14] God,
[4465.14 → 4465.82] we thank you,
[4466.26 → 4467.74] for your word,
[4467.92 → 4468.50] this morning,
[4468.60 → 4469.06] we thank you,
[4469.12 → 4469.70] for this,
[4470.14 → 4471.40] portion of your word,
[4471.58 → 4471.66] and,
[4476.22 → 4476.66] as,
[4476.92 → 4478.04] these words,
[4478.50 → 4480.66] linger with us,
[4481.10 → 4484.06] Holy Spirit,
[4484.18 → 4484.80] I ask that,
[4484.88 → 4485.76] whatever you have,
[4485.88 → 4486.48] spoken,
[4487.34 → 4488.62] into our hearts,
[4488.72 → 4489.72] or stirred us with,
[4489.80 → 4490.36] that you would,
[4490.92 → 4492.18] linger with us,
[4492.18 → 4494.54] there's something,
[4494.74 → 4495.46] for us,
[4495.54 → 4495.72] that,
[4495.80 → 4496.36] that's either,
[4496.50 → 4497.20] encouraged,
[4497.34 → 4497.96] or convicted,
[4498.26 → 4499.34] or spurred us on,
[4499.50 → 4500.44] would we be obedient,
[4500.72 → 4500.94] God,
[4501.00 → 4502.50] to what you've nudged us with,
[4503.50 → 4506.28] for anything,
[4506.42 → 4507.14] that's been spoken,
[4507.28 → 4508.36] unfaithful to your word,
[4508.42 → 4509.16] would it fall away,
[4510.80 → 4511.64] but God,
[4511.70 → 4512.66] do what only you can do,
[4512.74 → 4513.50] renew us,
[4514.38 → 4515.22] free us,
[4515.22 → 4516.02] from the things,
[4516.10 → 4516.90] that bind us,
[4516.90 → 4519.78] we would follow,
[4519.94 → 4520.42] in the way,
[4520.56 → 4521.38] that you've shown us,
[4521.46 → 4521.96] to live,
[4522.90 → 4525.20] with hope,
[4525.74 → 4526.90] for this glorious day,
[4527.00 → 4527.82] when you will return,
[4527.92 → 4528.82] in glory and power,
[4528.92 → 4529.46] and make all,
[4530.14 → 4530.90] things well,
[4531.08 → 4531.42] and new,
[4532.38 → 4533.30] may we be faithful,
[4533.44 → 4534.38] to that day comes,
[4535.12 → 4536.10] to live in the way,
[4536.16 → 4536.92] you've called us to live,
[4536.98 → 4538.02] we pray in Jesus name,
[4538.38 → 4538.66] amen,
[4540.66 → 4541.46] I was invited,
[4541.74 → 4543.04] to think about a song,
[4543.22 → 4544.26] to sing afterwards,
[4544.42 → 4545.38] this one came to mind,
[4545.50 → 4546.04] let's stand,
[4546.04 → 4546.64] if you're able to,
[4546.70 → 4547.40] we'll sing together,
[4547.52 → 4548.28] the servant song,
[4548.28 → 4549.28] the servant song,
[4549.28 → 4550.82] where he feels to live,
[4550.82 → 4552.18] may he be,
[4552.18 → 4552.58] prays,
[4552.58 → 4552.80] can?
[4558.90 → 4559.02] if for here he feels to live,
[4559.02 → 4559.76] at some times,
[4559.76 → 4560.96] or new time is KY ICI Neale,
[4560.96 → 4561.18] nor the anchor,
[4561.28 → 4562.32] who makes you bring a song,
[4562.34 → 4563.12] they're heading to the verse,
[4563.14 → 4563.74] to live within the role of the family,
[4563.74 → 4564.28] in name,
[4564.28 → 4564.76] may he be,
[4564.78 → 4565.34] let's do that,
[4565.34 → 4566.00] the soul of the family,
[4566.00 → 4566.52] let's do that,
[4566.52 → 4567.44] for that day,
[4567.44 → 4567.50] there can be a song,
[4567.50 → 4568.22] where he has sung,
[4568.22 → 4569.48] that one came from,
[4569.48 → 4570.04] to live in the loop,
[4570.04 → 4570.70] the Son,
[4570.94 → 4571.98] that one came from,
[4571.98 → 4572.10] there will do what,
[4572.10 → 4572.90] and that two came from,
[4572.90 → 4574.00] to live in the land,
[4574.04 → 4574.52] he says,
[4574.60 → 4575.22] let's do that,
[4575.22 → 4575.82] the vessel,
[4575.82 → 4576.24] and that one came from,
[4576.30 → 4577.56] him,
[4577.56 → 4580.56] as Christ to you.
[4581.10 → 4582.80] Pray though it could
[4582.80 → 4585.02] be held at grace
[4585.02 → 4587.26] to let you be
[4587.26 → 4590.70] my servant too.
[4593.00 → 4595.32] We are pilgrims
[4595.32 → 4597.10] on a journey.
[4597.10 → 4599.26] We are travellers
[4599.26 → 4601.48] along the road.
[4601.94 → 4603.56] We are here
[4603.56 → 4606.10] to help each other
[4606.10 → 4608.26] walk the mountain
[4608.26 → 4611.70] bare the road.
[4613.76 → 4615.46] I will hold
[4615.46 → 4618.04] the Christ's life for you
[4618.04 → 4619.84] in the night
[4619.84 → 4622.08] I know you're near.
[4622.60 → 4623.74] I will
[4623.74 → 4626.90] hold my hand out to you
[4626.90 → 4628.92] sweep the peace
[4628.92 → 4630.38] you long
[4630.38 → 4632.64] to hear.
[4634.00 → 4635.70] I will
[4635.70 → 4636.34] love me
[4636.34 → 4638.20] when you are
[4638.20 → 4638.78] me
[4638.78 → 4640.30] when you
[4640.30 → 4640.90] love
[4640.90 → 4642.00] my love
[4642.00 → 4643.18] will do.
[4643.74 → 4645.36] I will share
[4645.36 → 4647.64] your joy and sorrow
[4647.64 → 4649.86] day most in
[4649.86 → 4650.46] death
[4650.46 → 4651.36] turn
[4651.36 → 4652.34] and
[4652.34 → 4653.30] turn
[4653.30 → 4653.36] through.
[4653.36 → 4656.16] I will
[4656.16 → 4657.22] hold me
[4657.22 → 4658.58] July 7th
[4658.58 → 4659.12] I
[4659.12 → 4659.78] I
[4659.78 → 4660.78] will
[4660.78 → 4661.82] hear
[4661.82 → 4669.88] me
[4669.88 → 4670.34] do
[4670.34 → 4670.90] my
[4670.90 → 4670.98] dragon
[4670.98 → 4671.20] I
[4671.20 → 4671.84] all
[4671.84 → 4671.90] stand
[4671.90 → 4672.48] I
[4672.48 → 4673.02] but
[4673.02 → 4673.08] I
[4673.08 → 4673.28] T
[4673.28 → 4673.70] I
[4673.70 → 4688.14] Philip's going to come up in just a minute, but I asked him for permission.
[4688.26 → 4689.60] He thought it would be okay.
[4689.80 → 4695.12] I noticed you were taking an offering for Resonate, so I just want to do a couple of things.
[4695.12 → 4696.82] First, I just want to express deep gratitude.
[4697.48 → 4702.32] I'm the director of church planning with Resonate Global Mission, and I saw the offering you
[4702.32 → 4707.14] took up for Sierra Leone and are taking up again to support our work in Egypt, so I just
[4707.14 → 4708.78] want to express deep gratitude.
[4709.00 → 4711.58] Thank you for your partnership, your generosity.
[4713.34 → 4718.98] Our work in the Middle East is one that we can't talk a lot about in public for security
[4718.98 → 4727.04] reasons, so I can't say a lot, but I can say this, that God is doing amazing things in the
[4727.04 → 4733.64] Middle East in a number of Muslim-majority cultures and countries, and some of that is
[4733.64 → 4738.48] also taking, starting to shape some of our imagination and work in North America.
[4739.00 → 4745.66] There's a large, as you know, population from northern and southern India and Pakistan, even
[4745.66 → 4750.46] in our own region, and there's growing work in Pakistan with some of our members
[4750.46 → 4758.92] in the Middle East team, and we're imagining and exploring ways to do ministry both in
[4758.92 → 4762.92] Pakistan and in Canada and North America among Indo-Pak diaspora peoples.
[4762.92 → 4765.88] There's actually three churches that have been planted by the Christian Reformed Church
[4765.88 → 4769.28] in the state of California among Indo-Pak diaspora people.
[4769.28 → 4771.00] It's a ripe, ripe mission field.
[4771.00 → 4773.70] We're praying for God's leading to lead into that.
[4773.70 → 4780.18] And also, one of our historic partners in Egypt is sending pastors to plant Arabic-speaking
[4780.18 → 4784.16] churches in North America, and we're also exploring ways to partner with them.
[4784.16 → 4786.92] So God's doing a lot of stuff.
[4786.92 → 4790.88] That's all I should say, but thank you again for your generosity.
[4790.88 → 4805.82] We thank for the team to speak to us, also sharing the information about the Reset.
[4805.82 → 4806.86] Thanks for that.
[4806.86 → 4811.70] We also thank to Mr. Roger Gross being with us again.
[4811.70 → 4813.70] Thank you.
[4813.70 → 4821.50] And so we are all familiar with the offering, so I don't have to explain more.
[4821.50 → 4830.14] So Dickens, you can come up to collect the offering.
[4830.14 → 4835.14] Need one more?
[4835.14 → 4842.94] Thank you.
[4842.94 → 4847.94] Thank you.
[4847.94 → 4859.74] Thank you.
[4859.74 → 4872.54] Thank you.
[4872.54 → 4885.34] Thank you.
[4885.34 → 4889.34] Thank you.
[4889.34 → 4892.34] Thank you.
[4892.34 → 4916.40] Okay.
[4916.40 → 4921.40] Let us come before God in prayer.
[4921.40 → 4928.60] Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for the gift of this day, a day to rest, to worship,
[4928.60 → 4932.16] and to be reminded again of your faithfulness.
[4932.16 → 4936.32] As a community, we bring our hearts before you.
[4936.32 → 4942.64] We come not only with sons of praise, but with the needs and burdens of our lives and of
[4942.64 → 4944.64] the world.
[4944.64 → 4949.70] Lord, we lift the needs of our congregation.
[4949.70 → 4952.62] We know each heart gathered here.
[4952.62 → 4956.20] Those who are grieving the loss of loved ones.
[4956.20 → 4961.96] Those walking through illness or waiting for healing.
[4961.96 → 4967.04] Those facing loneliness, depression, or uncertainty.
[4967.04 → 4970.96] We ask for healing, comfort, and hope.
[4970.96 → 4979.64] Threatened caregivers, bless our elderly members, and encourage our youth as they grow in faith.
[4979.64 → 4980.64] We pray for our families.
[4980.64 → 4990.98] We pray for our families, for marriages in need of grace, for parents raising children in this complex world.
[4990.98 → 4998.48] And now, Lord, in the quiet of this moment, we lift to you the personal needs we carry in our hearts.
[4998.48 → 5020.48] Please remember Wilma Wend tow, Michael Wend tow, and Pat Bowman, Shirley Reyes, Eileen Maddow, Hank Annalise Wend tow, Tony Wend tow, and those, we don't know the name, but Lord, you know.
[5020.48 → 5026.98] You know them in your heart.
[5026.98 → 5032.48] Thank you that you hear every prayer, even those too deep for words.
[5032.48 → 5035.40] Renew our trust in your goodness.
[5035.40 → 5037.40] Help us to walk in faith.
[5037.40 → 5044.90] Love, find another well, and serve the world you have placed in.
[5044.90 → 5052.40] All this we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour, our Lord, and our coming King.
[5052.40 → 5053.90] Amen.
[5053.90 → 5064.90] So let's ask Pastor Tim to give a benediction.
[5064.90 → 5070.90] I invite you to stand if you're able to do that.
[5070.90 → 5078.40] We look to the Lord for his strength and his grace as he sends us out into this world.
[5078.40 → 5080.40] So I receive the Lord's blessing.
[5080.40 → 5091.40] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the presence and the power of the Holy Spirit be with you now and forevermore.
[5091.40 → 5092.40] Amen.
[5094.90 → 5112.90] Praise God for the Lord, and the blessings flow.
[5112.90 → 5118.90] Praise Him, O Jesus, here below.
[5118.90 → 5124.90] Praise Him above the heavenly host.
[5124.90 → 5130.90] Praise all the Son, and Holy Ghost.
[5130.90 → 5136.90] Amen.
[5136.90 → 5138.90] Praise God for the Lord.
[5138.90 → 5146.90] Praise God for the Lord.
[5146.90 → 5148.90] Amen.
[5148.90 → 5150.90] Amen.
[5150.90 → 5152.90] Amen.
[5152.90 → 5154.90] Amen.
[5154.90 → 5156.90] Amen.
[5156.90 → 5158.90] Amen.
[5158.90 → 5160.90] Amen.
[5160.90 → 5168.90] Amen.
[5168.90 → 5172.90] Amen.
[5172.90 → 5175.90] Amen.
[5175.90 → 5176.90] Amen.
[5176.90 → 5178.90] Amen.
[5178.90 → 5179.90] Amen.
[5179.90 → 5180.90] Amen.
[5180.90 → 5182.90] Amen.
[5182.90 → 5183.90] Amen.
[5183.90 → 5184.90] Amen.
[5184.90 → 5185.90] Amen.
