[0.20 --> 14.00]  .
[14.00 --> 16.00]  Amen.
[44.00 --> 46.00]  Amen.
[74.00 --> 81.00]  Amen.
[99.52 --> 101.32]  Good morning.
[101.32 --> 106.98]  I feel like I don't need to be up here on this stage.
[107.32 --> 109.54]  I can just be down here. We can throw more circle.
[110.44 --> 114.90]  But anyway, welcome to worship on this New Year's Day.
[115.58 --> 118.34]  It's Happy New Year to you all. Happy New Year.
[120.38 --> 125.96]  So, you know, it is good that we are here to worship the Lord on this first day of the week.
[125.96 --> 134.28]  I know it's hard to get up on a New Year's Day morning, and my family, two of them are sick, and so they didn't come.
[135.22 --> 137.90]  But we are here, and we're gathered in the Lord's name.
[138.82 --> 147.62]  And so let's open our worship service this morning with our call to worship from Psalm 65.
[148.02 --> 149.18]  And we'll say it responsibly.
[149.18 --> 155.06]  Praise awaits you, our God in Zion.
[155.40 --> 157.38]  To you our vows will be fulfilled.
[158.38 --> 162.64]  You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.
[163.60 --> 168.18]  When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
[169.18 --> 174.14]  Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts.
[174.14 --> 182.86]  You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
[183.74 --> 189.50]  You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
[190.42 --> 195.40]  So let's open with a word of prayer and praise our Lord this morning.
[195.74 --> 196.44]  Let's pray together.
[197.72 --> 201.72]  Oh Lord, you are a God of love, and you are a God of mercy.
[201.86 --> 202.50]  We praise you.
[202.50 --> 210.00]  You are our Father, and you are a Father of peace, and you are a Father of righteousness.
[211.56 --> 216.12]  And we pray this morning, Lord, as we gather in your name on this first day of the new year,
[216.84 --> 224.72]  would you help us to worship you with hearts that are full of gladness, hearts that are full of faith and trust.
[224.72 --> 234.86]  Lord, would you open our eyes and our ears to see and to savor our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our King,
[235.52 --> 239.24]  who came into this world in tenderness and in love,
[240.10 --> 244.98]  the one who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty God.
[244.98 --> 252.92]  We pray, Lord, in your name and ask that you would be with us in our praises and our prayers and our hopes this morning.
[253.28 --> 255.02]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[255.02 --> 262.64]  Well, let's stand and greet those around us as we first hear God's greeting to us.
[263.06 --> 266.32]  For Mark chapter 3, this might be a little bit unusual greeting.
[266.90 --> 268.72]  Well, sorry, I jumped the gun.
[271.32 --> 273.22]  Well, all right.
[273.28 --> 275.06]  First, listen to God's greeting.
[275.06 --> 280.04]  Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted.
[280.62 --> 281.86]  And they came to him.
[282.32 --> 285.06]  He appointed 12 that they might be with him.
[286.36 --> 288.18]  And I chose that greeting this morning
[288.18 --> 292.96]  because I think it's a good way to start the year,
[293.04 --> 298.02]  to realize that Jesus calls us to himself and he wants us to be with him.
[298.82 --> 301.52]  Now, go ahead and greet your neighbors.
[305.06 --> 335.04]  Thank you.
[335.06 --> 348.88]  Thank you.
[348.88 --> 354.60]  Thank you.
[354.60 --> 355.42]  Thank you.
[355.42 --> 385.40]  Thank you.
[385.42 --> 415.40]  Thank you.
[415.42 --> 417.82]  So we're just going to sing this one once, okay?
[417.82 --> 419.82]  Thank you.
[447.82 --> 449.82]  Thank you.
[477.82 --> 479.82]  Thank you.
[479.82 --> 481.82]  Thank you.
[481.82 --> 483.82]  Thank you.
[483.82 --> 485.82]  Thank you.
[485.82 --> 487.82]  Thank you.
[487.82 --> 489.82]  Thank you.
[489.82 --> 491.82]  Thank you.
[491.82 --> 495.82]  Thank you.
[495.82 --> 497.82]  Thank you.
[497.82 --> 501.82]  Thank you.
[501.82 --> 517.22]  our home, living for all the world we see. Lord, we believe. Lord, we believe. Lord,
[517.22 --> 527.54]  we believe. We're just singing it once, Doug. Okay. So we're going to do, I can do hymns
[527.54 --> 532.96]  by request here. The numbers are small enough. I shouldn't miss any hands. So let's stand
[532.96 --> 539.54]  for the first one. Who has a hymn they would like to sing? Martin, I know you have one.
[539.54 --> 554.36]  You said so last night. What is it? 440? We'll sing all four verses since this is a very short.
[557.54 --> 559.54]  Text.
[559.54 --> 564.54]  Children of God, love and father, sing in Christmas and heaven.
[564.54 --> 569.54]  If you are born for a glory, sing in Christmas and heaven.
[569.54 --> 581.54]  If you are born for a glory, sing in Christmas and heaven. If you are born for a glory,
[581.54 --> 586.54]  for the glory, we believe.
[586.54 --> 596.54]  If you are born for a glory, sing in Christmas and heaven. If you are born for a glory,
[596.54 --> 601.54]  if you are born for a glory, you will be born for a glory, and you will be born for a glory.
[601.54 --> 611.54]  If you are born for a glory, and you will be born for a glory.
[611.54 --> 622.54]  If you are born for a glory, your children's children's children's children.
[622.54 --> 632.34]  And his breath's healing, he has fallen to him.
[634.44 --> 644.68]  He has given, he has taken, but his children have forsaken.
[644.68 --> 655.62]  We are going purposefully to preserve them pure and holy.
[657.74 --> 660.22]  You can be seated if you like.
[660.84 --> 661.72]  Who has another one?
[661.72 --> 662.88]  Sorry?
[669.40 --> 670.32]  473.
[674.68 --> 681.56]  473.
[681.56 --> 683.72]  483.
[683.72 --> 683.78]  483.
[683.78 --> 684.78]  483.
[684.78 --> 685.78]  493.
[685.78 --> 687.78]  493.
[687.78 --> 689.78]  503.
[689.78 --> 690.78]  503.
[690.78 --> 691.78]  504.
[691.78 --> 692.78]  503.
[692.78 --> 694.78]  515.
[694.78 --> 697.78]  515.
[697.78 --> 699.78]  515.
[699.78 --> 703.78]  515.
[703.78 --> 705.78]  that with you
[707.30 --> 711.66]  so
[733.78 --> 740.70]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, and the people rejoice.
[741.10 --> 753.40]  O come to the Father, be Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory with things He has done.
[753.40 --> 755.12]  Let's do verse 3.
[755.12 --> 768.02]  With things He has taught us with things He has done, and we will rejoice in Jesus the Son.
[768.02 --> 781.02]  The people will come, and we do will be a wonder of the blessing when Jesus will sing.
[781.02 --> 787.64]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, and the people hear His voice.
[787.98 --> 794.08]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, and the people rejoice.
[794.08 --> 807.00]  O come to the Father, be Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory with things He has done.
[807.00 --> 813.50]  There was somebody in the back that had their hand up before.
[814.92 --> 818.86]  Next, somebody had a song they wanted to sing.
[820.22 --> 822.76]  So a couple of hands up earlier.
[823.76 --> 824.32]  Yes, Margaret.
[824.32 --> 839.30]  Can we do verses 1 and 2, the chorus, and then verses 3 and 4 in the chorus?
[841.06 --> 841.46]  Okay.
[841.90 --> 845.30]  Verses 1, 2, chorus, and then 3, 4, and the chorus.
[845.30 --> 870.34]  Oh, Lord, my God.
[870.34 --> 881.56]  When I did awesome wonder, consider all the works that had to play.
[882.32 --> 888.44]  I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder.
[889.54 --> 894.72]  Thy power through water, the universe display.
[894.72 --> 902.72]  When through the walls and forest clouds I wander.
[902.72 --> 909.92]  I hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
[909.92 --> 916.92]  When I long down from lofty mountain grander.
[916.92 --> 923.50]  And hear the broken, feel the gentle breeze.
[923.50 --> 930.50]  Then sings my soul, my Savior, all to Thee.
[930.50 --> 933.50]  How great Thou art.
[933.50 --> 936.50]  How great Thou art.
[936.50 --> 943.50]  Then sings my soul, my Savior, all to Thee.
[943.50 --> 947.50]  How great Thou art.
[947.50 --> 949.50]  How great Thou art.
[949.50 --> 952.50]  How great Thou art.
[952.50 --> 954.50]  How great Thou art.
[954.50 --> 955.50]  That red I think.
[955.50 --> 959.50]  That God is some not sparing.
[959.50 --> 962.50]  Set Him to die.
[962.50 --> 966.50]  I scarce can take it in.
[966.50 --> 973.50]  That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing.
[973.50 --> 980.50]  He bled and died to take away my sin.
[980.50 --> 988.50]  When Christ shall come, we shall have acclimation.
[988.50 --> 991.50]  And give His own.
[991.50 --> 992.50]  And give His own.
[992.50 --> 995.50]  That joy shall fill my heart.
[995.50 --> 1001.50]  Then I shall walk in humble adoration.
[1001.50 --> 1004.50]  And give His own.
[1004.50 --> 1005.50]  And give His own.
[1005.50 --> 1008.50]  My God, O great Thou art.
[1008.50 --> 1010.50]  Would you stand for the final chorus, please?
[1010.50 --> 1017.50]  Then sings my soul, my Savior, all to Thee.
[1017.50 --> 1021.50]  How great Thou art.
[1021.50 --> 1025.50]  How great Thou art.
[1025.50 --> 1032.50]  Then sings my soul, my Savior, all to Thee.
[1032.50 --> 1042.50]  How great Thou art.
[1042.50 --> 1044.50]  You may be seated.
[1044.50 --> 1061.50]  So I wanted to share with you today this liturgy for a new year.
[1061.50 --> 1067.50]  And this comes from a book, and there's actually several volumes, called Every Moment Holy.
[1067.50 --> 1071.50]  And I made it into a responsive liturgy.
[1071.50 --> 1080.50]  And so let's use this as a way to kind of orient our hearts to God in our hopes for His help in leading in the new year.
[1080.50 --> 1081.50]  Okay.
[1081.50 --> 1082.50]  So I'll begin.
[1082.50 --> 1091.50]  O children of the living God, what is your Father's greatest desire for you this year?
[1091.50 --> 1102.50]  That we should love Him with all our hearts, with all our souls, with all our minds, and with all our strength.
[1102.50 --> 1105.50]  And how would you show this love?
[1105.50 --> 1109.50]  By remembering Him at all times.
[1109.50 --> 1114.50]  By cultivating thankfulness for His many blessings.
[1114.50 --> 1120.50]  And trusting His good providence for the meeting of our needs.
[1120.50 --> 1124.50]  By loving all whose lives intersect our own.
[1124.50 --> 1128.50]  By choosing to serve rather than to be served.
[1128.50 --> 1132.50]  To be wounded rather than to wound.
[1132.50 --> 1137.50]  And by bearing patiently with the failings of others.
[1137.50 --> 1147.50]  Extending the same kindness, mercy, and compassion that God in Christ has so graciously offered us.
[1147.50 --> 1154.50]  Do you now possess the needed strength to perfectly accomplish such holy requirements?
[1154.50 --> 1155.50]  We do not.
[1155.50 --> 1158.50]  We are weak and inconsistent.
[1158.50 --> 1164.50]  And often buffeted by fear and pride and selfishness.
[1164.50 --> 1167.50]  But we will look to the grace of God.
[1167.50 --> 1171.50]  And to the sanctifying work of the Spirit.
[1171.50 --> 1175.50]  To accomplish His purposes in and through us.
[1175.50 --> 1178.50]  This day and this year.
[1178.50 --> 1185.50]  As we, in grateful response, seek to choose that which pleases Him.
[1185.50 --> 1189.50]  We open our hearts anew to you this morning, O Lord.
[1189.50 --> 1194.50]  That the love of the Father and the life of Christ and the breath of the Spirit.
[1194.50 --> 1199.50]  Would quicken within us a greater affection for your ways.
[1199.50 --> 1203.50]  Work your will in us, Lord Christ.
[1203.50 --> 1204.50]  Amen.
[1204.50 --> 1207.50]  Thank you for joining me with that.
[1207.50 --> 1217.50]  Now, I would like to invite Joe Schulk, our Chair of Council, to come up and give us the year in review.
[1217.50 --> 1234.50]  Happy New Year.
[1234.50 --> 1238.50]  Happy New Year.
[1238.50 --> 1243.50]  And let's talk about 2024 that just closed.
[1243.50 --> 1253.50]  Once again, we as a congregation at Ladner can testify to God's faithfulness to us.
[1253.50 --> 1257.50]  We were able to hear God's word preached to us each Sunday of this past year.
[1257.50 --> 1262.50]  We are thankful for the faithful preaching and shepherding of Pastor Jason.
[1262.50 --> 1268.50]  Pastor Jason and his family have been with us five years as of today.
[1268.50 --> 1272.50]  Some of the sermon series Pastor Jason preached this year were,
[1272.50 --> 1284.50]  Come to the Table for Lent, Remember Your Death, Resurrection and Presence, Romans and for Advent, Preparing the Way.
[1284.50 --> 1289.50]  This past year, Pastor Jason led a baptism and a membership class.
[1289.50 --> 1292.50]  And so much more.
[1292.50 --> 1302.50]  We are so thankful and blessed for the pastoring of Pastor Jason and leading us in this past year.
[1302.50 --> 1310.50]  We continue to support the work of resident missionaries, Nazje Umran and Anne Zaki in Cairo.
[1310.50 --> 1321.50]  We are happy also to now support Hannah van der Kemp in her work with resident ministries serving refugees in Lesbos, Greece.
[1321.50 --> 1333.50]  And we continue to support the Johnson families in Salmon Arm who minister to Indigenous people while serving with North America Indigenous Ministries.
[1333.50 --> 1340.50]  We were able to take part in three sessions of cross training put together by our cross training committee.
[1340.50 --> 1353.50]  The sessions were Angel Facts after Acts, Church History from the Apostles to Nicaea and the Canons of Dort.
[1353.50 --> 1361.50]  At this last February's congregational meeting, we continued the discussion of a name change for our church.
[1361.50 --> 1367.50]  A vote confirmed that most members are not in favor of a name change.
[1367.50 --> 1374.50]  Other highlights or things of note from council or the congregation are these.
[1374.50 --> 1385.50]  Yeah, we did discuss replacing a broken and long removed steeple from the church.
[1385.50 --> 1389.50]  And the expense that it would take.
[1389.50 --> 1392.50]  Did anyone even notice that it was missing?
[1392.50 --> 1397.50]  There was no appetite to see it replaced at this time.
[1397.50 --> 1406.50]  Dr. John Bolt, raised here out of Ladner CRC, and Pastor Professor Emeritus,
[1406.50 --> 1417.50]  asked and received permission to access historical records of Ladner CRC and three other lower mainland CRC churches.
[1417.50 --> 1430.50]  He is researching archival materials to put together a book relating to the formation of CRC churches in the lower mainland in the late 40s and 50s.
[1430.50 --> 1439.50]  And these churches, especially the church's relationship to the establishment of Christian schools in these areas.
[1439.50 --> 1449.50]  Dr. Bolt has hoped for some releases to coincide with our 75th anniversary later this year.
[1449.50 --> 1466.50]  We hope to finally replace our tired sanctuary projector with two large television screens early in the new year, promising much better pictures and much better reading on brighter screens.
[1466.50 --> 1478.50]  Much of our faith promise giving information, our financial reports and our budget now has been translated into Mandarin for those brothers and sisters in our Chinese ministry.
[1478.50 --> 1494.50]  Maintenance committee, with the help and input from analysts and sound reproduction experts, were not successful in finding a doable remedy to help our hearing impaired.
[1494.50 --> 1501.50]  Those that need and will continue to be able to use individual telecoils available at our sound booth.
[1501.50 --> 1511.50]  We're told new technology presently being developed may be able to help us within the next couple of years.
[1511.50 --> 1523.50]  We hope everyone has seen and is enjoying our recently completed small kitchen renovation complete with new flooring.
[1523.50 --> 1526.50]  Everybody has noticed, correct?
[1526.50 --> 1533.50]  Unfortunately, a larger kitchen renovation is not in our budget at this time.
[1533.50 --> 1548.50]  As a congregation we supported and are thankful to Marian Vendriale who traveled to Calgary to attend the gathering as a representative of our classes BC Southeast and our church.
[1548.50 --> 1563.30]  The focus of the three-day workshop was, do we have our eyes open to serve in our community, based on Luke 24, and a biblical passage relative to the road to Emmaus.
[1564.30 --> 1571.54]  Marian provided a moving and thought-provoking insight to Council and others on her experience.
[1571.54 --> 1586.34]  We would be remiss not to mention the ongoing and tremendous significant support that members of Ladner CRC have long been provided to Delta Christian School,
[1587.14 --> 1596.46]  who this past year celebrated 65 years of God's providence and faithfulness in providing Christian-based education here in Ladner and area,
[1596.46 --> 1608.58]  and now are further providing, needing help in a significant building addition project that they're putting on at DCS.
[1609.34 --> 1610.84]  Thanks be to God.
[1612.42 --> 1618.46]  We're also reminded that at our next congregational meeting, probably in February,
[1618.46 --> 1626.32]  and February, we'll deal with both the financial statements of this past year and also the budget for the new year.
[1626.88 --> 1635.86]  We'll put those together in one meeting, and we do that also to conform fully to the Society's Act provisions that we should adhere to.
[1635.86 --> 1649.44]  I pop into this church often at all times of the day, and I'm always amazed at the amount of activity that is actually occurring here.
[1649.90 --> 1652.92]  This is not just a building used on Sundays for worship.
[1653.70 --> 1659.36]  There are so many different groups and activities happening, and it's great to see.
[1659.36 --> 1672.50]  Let's not forget about Wind and Tide, the preschool that have 25 to 30 little children that are here every day, Monday to Friday, 9 to 3 each week.
[1673.50 --> 1678.52]  There are many, many active ministries that are very busy over this past year.
[1679.46 --> 1689.08]  Kids' Life, Nursery, Cadets, Gems, Friendship, Men's Breakfast, a number of small groups,
[1689.36 --> 1697.20]  singing at Mount View Manor, weekly ESL classes, and coffee drop-in on Thursday mornings.
[1698.30 --> 1707.74]  We appreciate each volunteer involved in all of these ministries, none of which would happen without you.
[1709.52 --> 1715.56]  And our associate pastor, Nancy, continues to be such a blessing with our Chinese ministry.
[1715.56 --> 1727.72]  Her ministry consists of discipleship training, some 15 to 20 people, praise dance exercises, followed by fellowship over potluck lunch.
[1728.74 --> 1732.84]  Many of their activities involve food, and that's great.
[1733.66 --> 1738.20]  Nancy leads prayer meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in person and via Zoom.
[1738.20 --> 1752.84]  Three small home groups have organized in Richmond, Tawasson, and Ladner, and are meeting weekly, mostly, to study the Bible and for prayer.
[1754.20 --> 1759.06]  An average of 40 to 45 people join in their worship on Sunday mornings.
[1760.24 --> 1765.10]  Nancy does most of the preaching along with a guest pastor once or twice a month.
[1765.10 --> 1772.10]  Other activities are Mandarin Kids Life class, choir, praise team practices.
[1773.72 --> 1782.74]  A children's choir under the direction of Wang Huan was formed and performed in a joint worship service here just before Christmas.
[1783.52 --> 1787.42]  And what a blessing it was to see those children sing for us.
[1787.42 --> 1795.68]  Every second Sunday of the month, our English and Mandarin groups meet together here in Family Sunday worship.
[1796.46 --> 1801.56]  We worship and celebrate communion and then separate for our own rest of the service.
[1801.56 --> 1809.62]  Our music director, Paul Kemp's gifts are certainly a blessing to our worship, enhancing our praise with music.
[1810.16 --> 1820.96]  We are so grateful for Paul and so thankful to all of our worship teams and musicians that lead us each Sunday in a time of worship.
[1820.96 --> 1828.88]  During the year, we have enjoyed times of fellowship with soup and bun lunches after morning services.
[1828.88 --> 1835.46]  And of course, our highlighted fall barbecue, sponsored or hosted by our council.
[1836.46 --> 1841.38]  Thanks to our hospitality team for organizing all of these events.
[1841.38 --> 1848.98]  And for the tireless deacon aid group who hosts the social gatherings following funeral or memorial services.
[1850.10 --> 1861.50]  This group also ensured that our seniors enjoyed and so appreciated a bus trip to Abbotsford, visiting the Mennonite Museum and sharing a great lunch.
[1861.50 --> 1870.62]  Often working without being noticed or spoken about, our groups and committees who function faithfully.
[1871.66 --> 1883.44]  The worship committee, our hospitality team, the maintenance committee, our county committee, the persons who keep our library so organized and relevant,
[1884.38 --> 1891.22]  the safe church team, and of course our diaconal and pastoral teams who as a council provide leadership.
[1891.50 --> 1894.00]  Within our congregation.
[1895.80 --> 1901.30]  And what would our worship and other services be or look like without our audiovisual team?
[1901.98 --> 1909.44]  Or our many vocalists and musicians who faithfully serve us weekly or when asked?
[1910.60 --> 1917.00]  Thanks to the auditors who yearly and in timely manner complete our audits as required.
[1917.00 --> 1929.28]  And we are so thankful to and for Mal Rass, our treasurer, longstanding treasurer, keeping our finances and records in good order.
[1930.10 --> 1932.20]  I don't think he ever takes a week off.
[1932.80 --> 1935.14]  He might only take a couple of days off occasionally.
[1935.14 --> 1943.20]  But he ensures that our finances and our accounting are in tip-top shape.
[1943.84 --> 1946.80]  We are thankful each year that we are able to meet our budget.
[1947.70 --> 1951.10]  And sometimes even blessed to have a small surplus.
[1951.10 --> 1962.84]  And just an insight that I was made aware of last night was the giving for the month of December was unheard of.
[1963.08 --> 1964.28]  It was fantastic.
[1965.18 --> 1970.64]  And so I think there will be, again, a small overage this year.
[1971.72 --> 1973.94]  And Mal and we are all thankful.
[1973.94 --> 1982.48]  Some of the other highlights of the year were the many baptisms we were able to witness.
[1983.42 --> 1989.48]  Just last Sunday we witnessed the infant baptism of Maya Vandermeer.
[1990.12 --> 1990.70]  What a blessing.
[1991.84 --> 2002.28]  Youth and adults baptized this year were Fred Fing, Rulian Gong, Fanny Liu, Rose Yale, Briston Wang.
[2002.28 --> 2005.52]  We also welcomed his new members.
[2006.12 --> 2018.18]  Amy Dow, Helen Lee, Teresa Lee, Jeanette Tang, Sarah Tao, Kathy Wang, Gavin Yang, Zhong Zhu,
[2021.18 --> 2031.52]  Kayuki Arga, Salam Germa, Nicole Chin, Pat Craig, Tina Lee, David Van Dorn,
[2031.52 --> 2033.04]  and Carol Wang.
[2034.24 --> 2038.50]  That's 21 members we welcomed into our fellowship this year.
[2039.42 --> 2039.94]  Amazing.
[2040.64 --> 2042.08]  Thanks be to God.
[2044.12 --> 2047.22]  Sadly, Brian and Marcy Grotendorst and family,
[2047.78 --> 2053.16]  and Mike and Marion Canaris and family left us to join other churches.
[2054.46 --> 2060.16]  Dave and Grace Sturgeon have joined a church in Carameas, British Columbia.
[2060.16 --> 2069.92]  Our congregation was saddened by the deaths of five longtime members of Ladner CRC.
[2071.22 --> 2074.16]  Anna Krohn on January 21st.
[2075.76 --> 2078.16]  Sonia Kuhn on February 8th.
[2078.16 --> 2084.16]  Henry Vuchtevin on Good Friday, March 29th.
[2085.68 --> 2088.16]  Jeanette Vanderwood on May 20th.
[2089.84 --> 2093.52]  And Joe Vuchtevin on July 31st.
[2093.52 --> 2101.24]  We take comfort from the psalmist who reminds us that the Lord heals the brokenhearted and binds their wounds.
[2102.00 --> 2108.52]  We look forward to the return of Christ when God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[2109.38 --> 2113.30]  There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
[2113.98 --> 2116.00]  There will be no more pain.
[2116.00 --> 2122.06]  For the former things have passed away, as we're told in Revelation 21.
[2124.02 --> 2133.74]  We would be remiss not also to remember the sudden passing of our fellow brother in Christ, Ernst de Vries, just a couple of months ago.
[2133.74 --> 2146.32]  Ernst and Winnie and family have been longtime members of Ladner CRC, where Ernst served so faithfully and long as a ministry leader.
[2146.32 --> 2163.40]  Elder, evangelist, long-time seafarer's ministry leader, a commissioned preacher who preached often from this pulpit, and before leaving for Pinocchio as the associate pastor for seniors.
[2164.40 --> 2170.36]  We rejoice that Ernst, too, was welcomed into glory with those words,
[2170.96 --> 2173.98]  Well done, good and faithful servant.
[2173.98 --> 2183.26]  We do not know what God has planned for us this coming year as a congregation in 2025.
[2184.46 --> 2189.82]  Yes, we'll celebrate our 75th anniversary as Ladner CRC in October,
[2190.28 --> 2198.84]  and we need to give our thanks and praise for the many years Christ's Church here in Ladner has been so richly blessed
[2198.84 --> 2205.96]  and been a blessing to many here in Ladner and the surrounding communities.
[2206.68 --> 2214.04]  We ask for and pray that our Heavenly Father continue His blessing and care of us as we grow in grace together.
[2214.04 --> 2225.16]  Let us all live in excited anticipation of what our Heavenly Father has already planned for us at Ladner CRC in this year.
[2225.16 --> 2227.16]  Thank you.
[2227.16 --> 2227.72]  Thank you.
[2227.72 --> 2233.72]  This report, by the way, was put together by our Clerk, Angela Hemming,
[2234.44 --> 2240.12]  assisted ably by our former Clerk, John Banstra, with input from a couple of others.
[2240.12 --> 2241.12]  Thank you.
[2241.12 --> 2241.14]  Thank you.
[2241.14 --> 2241.20]  Thank you.
[2253.68 --> 2257.60]  Having heard all of that information, let's sing.
[2258.40 --> 2264.12]  He will hold me fast, looking to the future of how God directs and keeps us.
[2264.12 --> 2269.68]  Oh, sorry.
[2270.36 --> 2272.66]  All glory be to God in Christ.
[2273.96 --> 2277.10]  And this is to the tune of Auld Lang Syne.
[2277.10 --> 2278.10]  So, um...
[2278.10 --> 2296.26]  Should nothing of our efforts have no legacy survive,
[2296.26 --> 2306.34]  at last the Lord does praise the Most, in vain its biggest strife.
[2306.34 --> 2308.34]  To you...
[2308.34 --> 2309.34]  Oh, sorry.
[2309.34 --> 2318.34]  To you, those tomorrow's gain, tell me what is your life?
[2318.34 --> 2323.34]  The peace that furnishes it all.
[2323.34 --> 2327.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2327.34 --> 2333.34]  All glory be to Christ, O King.
[2333.34 --> 2337.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2337.34 --> 2342.34]  His rule and reign will ever sing.
[2342.34 --> 2347.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2347.34 --> 2349.34]  His will be to Christ.
[2349.34 --> 2351.34]  His will be done.
[2351.34 --> 2358.34]  His kingdom come on earth and is above.
[2358.34 --> 2363.34]  The wisdom still for daily bread,
[2363.34 --> 2367.34]  Praising the Lord of love.
[2367.34 --> 2379.34]  Let living waters satisfy the thirsty with the price.
[2379.34 --> 2383.34]  We'll take a cup of kindness, yeah.
[2383.34 --> 2387.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2387.34 --> 2389.34]  And the Lord of love.
[2389.34 --> 2390.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2390.34 --> 2394.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2394.34 --> 2398.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2398.34 --> 2402.34]  His rule and reign will ever sing.
[2402.34 --> 2408.34]  All glory be to Christ.
[2408.34 --> 2417.96]  When all the day the great, the faithful, the God of all,
[2418.56 --> 2427.40]  the Lamb who was forsaken, is making all things new.
[2428.48 --> 2437.62]  Behold, our God shall live with us, and we are served as God.
[2437.62 --> 2447.00]  And we shall all His people be, all glory be to Christ.
[2447.44 --> 2456.82]  All glory be to Christ, our King, all glory be to Christ.
[2456.82 --> 2466.82]  His rule, our reign, will never sing, all glory be to Christ.
[2467.62 --> 2469.54]  You may be seated.
[2469.54 --> 2482.30]  Well, thank you, Joe, and for the others who also worked on that year in review.
[2482.30 --> 2491.54]  And, you know, I think it embodies our many prayers that we've carried through the year.
[2491.92 --> 2493.64]  And so I'm forgetful.
[2493.90 --> 2501.40]  I think it's good to remember, right, to look back and see what God has done in the year.
[2501.40 --> 2505.28]  Because, you know, if we're always kind of looking forward and praying for things that we hope to happen,
[2505.82 --> 2511.12]  but, you know, we need to take time to also be thankful and to reflect back on God's faithfulness to us.
[2511.46 --> 2516.90]  So I think it's always a highlight when we, you know, have this.
[2516.90 --> 2523.44]  So we'll open God's word together today.
[2524.32 --> 2531.40]  And I think it's a wonderful thing to do on this first day of the new year to begin with hearing God's word.
[2532.24 --> 2537.52]  And so if you would join me in opening your Bibles to Romans chapter 13.
[2537.52 --> 2539.86]  You don't have to open.
[2540.08 --> 2543.14]  We'll also look at the scripture on the screen if you'd like.
[2552.02 --> 2556.78]  So Romans chapter 13, verses 11 to 14.
[2556.88 --> 2559.28]  That's on page 845 in your Bible.
[2559.80 --> 2560.76]  Page 845.
[2560.76 --> 2565.16]  And let's hear God's word.
[2565.90 --> 2567.04]  Beginning in verse 11.
[2568.04 --> 2571.22]  And do this, understanding the present time.
[2571.88 --> 2574.28]  The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber.
[2574.88 --> 2578.38]  Because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
[2579.08 --> 2580.48]  The night is nearly over.
[2580.68 --> 2581.92]  The day is almost here.
[2582.48 --> 2586.08]  So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[2586.08 --> 2588.98]  Let us behave decently as in the daytime.
[2589.60 --> 2591.10]  Not in orgies and drunkenness.
[2591.56 --> 2593.46]  Not in sexual immorality and debauchery.
[2594.02 --> 2595.40]  Not in dissension and jealousy.
[2596.12 --> 2600.24]  Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2600.74 --> 2604.74]  And do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
[2605.46 --> 2606.68]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2608.04 --> 2610.68]  Let's ask for God's blessing upon his word this morning.
[2610.68 --> 2623.66]  Oh Lord, on this first day of 2025, we come before you as your people, desiring again and afresh to follow you.
[2624.96 --> 2626.84]  To hear your word.
[2627.30 --> 2628.40]  To draw close to you.
[2628.48 --> 2630.32]  To grow in our faith.
[2630.46 --> 2635.22]  And so Lord, we come now as your children asking you, Lord, for your blessing.
[2635.88 --> 2639.34]  As we open our word, your word, and as we read it together.
[2639.78 --> 2640.84]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2641.04 --> 2641.28]  Amen.
[2642.90 --> 2646.78]  So maybe some of you will know the name St. Francis of Assisi.
[2647.18 --> 2650.78]  He was a guy who lived in the early 13th century.
[2651.60 --> 2654.92]  And he was really a reformer of the church.
[2655.96 --> 2660.22]  The church at that time was very wealthy, very corrupt.
[2660.22 --> 2664.78]  And Francis himself came from a great wealthy family.
[2665.74 --> 2670.34]  But he was like, you know, there must be more to life than this.
[2671.10 --> 2679.66]  And so he began to give away or deny everything that he had of earthly worth.
[2679.86 --> 2682.88]  And to earnestly follow Jesus.
[2683.82 --> 2689.36]  And so not only did he reform his own life, but he also dedicated his life to reforming the church.
[2689.36 --> 2694.06]  And he was at the very end of his life, even on his deathbed.
[2694.62 --> 2696.56]  And he was looking back at his life.
[2696.64 --> 2699.48]  And you would think he would say something like, you know,
[2700.34 --> 2705.54]  Sure, I've made some mistakes in my life, but I'm just so proud of the legacy that I've left.
[2705.60 --> 2706.62]  Or something like that.
[2707.26 --> 2708.54]  But this is what he said.
[2709.04 --> 2709.90]  We have this quote here.
[2709.90 --> 2713.14]  Let us begin again.
[2713.72 --> 2716.52]  For until now we have done nothing.
[2720.06 --> 2721.70]  Let us begin again.
[2722.70 --> 2725.96]  For until now we have done nothing.
[2727.32 --> 2731.40]  Now, you could hear that and think,
[2732.68 --> 2734.80]  Wow, that sounds kind of bleak.
[2734.80 --> 2739.34]  But I think what he's getting at is something very important.
[2740.34 --> 2744.84]  Which is that a life of following Jesus is a series of new beginnings.
[2745.58 --> 2749.54]  It's a series of new opportunities to begin again, to start afresh.
[2750.04 --> 2753.42]  To seek Christ anew in our lives.
[2753.42 --> 2759.44]  And there's this sense in which the Christian life is one in which we are ever seeking to grow.
[2759.96 --> 2766.58]  We are ever seeking to commit our lives more and more fully to Jesus and to mature in faith.
[2768.78 --> 2771.88]  And isn't it interesting that human beings,
[2772.26 --> 2779.42]  we walk around in our lives with that sense that we need to grow.
[2779.42 --> 2782.04]  That we need to change.
[2782.84 --> 2785.94]  I mean, do antelope do that?
[2786.94 --> 2788.68]  Do cows do that?
[2788.84 --> 2788.92]  Right?
[2789.22 --> 2795.52]  Does an antelope wander around in the, you know, African savanna thinking to themselves,
[2795.78 --> 2798.54]  I'm just not living my best version of my antelope self.
[2800.04 --> 2803.92]  Or a cow in the barn thinking, I just need to become a better cow.
[2804.10 --> 2804.38]  No.
[2805.62 --> 2806.34]  Cows don't do that.
[2806.42 --> 2807.28]  Antelopes don't do that.
[2807.40 --> 2808.76]  Animals just exist.
[2809.42 --> 2814.34]  But humans, we go through life with a sense that we need to change.
[2814.48 --> 2815.34]  That we need to grow.
[2816.84 --> 2820.70]  And we are obsessed with trying to change ourselves.
[2821.34 --> 2821.50]  Right?
[2821.54 --> 2822.74]  Especially when?
[2823.62 --> 2825.28]  On the new year.
[2825.36 --> 2826.62]  The first day of the new year.
[2826.78 --> 2826.92]  Right?
[2827.04 --> 2832.16]  And so we have best-selling books about how to have, you know, go about personal growth.
[2832.72 --> 2836.10]  We have health hacks and seminars and podcasts.
[2837.10 --> 2838.02]  And retreats.
[2838.12 --> 2838.92]  All these things.
[2839.42 --> 2844.12]  As a culture, we're obsessed with trying to better ourselves.
[2844.12 --> 2851.78]  And the story of the Bible, fascinatingly, does not shame us for that.
[2851.78 --> 2856.42]  It doesn't shame us for that inner need and that desire to change.
[2856.42 --> 2857.04]  In fact, it dignifies us.
[2857.04 --> 2859.24]  In fact, it dignifies it.
[2859.64 --> 2865.16]  And it even calls us and urges us to a life of growth and a life of change.
[2865.62 --> 2868.20]  And that's what we find in our passage this morning in Romans.
[2868.52 --> 2871.44]  It's about growing in virtue.
[2871.44 --> 2874.36]  It's about growing in the Christian life.
[2874.36 --> 2881.44]  And so since today, maybe out of all days, we are kind of thinking about that.
[2881.54 --> 2883.16]  How do we grow in the Christian life?
[2883.26 --> 2888.14]  What might God have in store for me in 2025 in my relationship with him?
[2888.14 --> 2895.28]  I think, you know, I want to just look at this passage and see what it can teach us about growth in virtue.
[2895.28 --> 2900.64]  And we're going to look at this through a series of four questions today.
[2900.64 --> 2905.14]  If you're the kind of person who takes notes, I know Marian is ready.
[2907.52 --> 2909.40]  Here's what those questions are.
[2910.74 --> 2911.74]  What is virtue?
[2913.52 --> 2914.84]  Why does it matter?
[2915.98 --> 2917.28]  Why is it so difficult?
[2917.58 --> 2918.40]  And how do we get it?
[2919.50 --> 2921.06]  Okay, so what is virtue?
[2922.56 --> 2923.60]  Why does it matter?
[2924.42 --> 2925.72]  Why is it so difficult?
[2926.44 --> 2927.54]  How do we get it?
[2928.12 --> 2929.12]  So let's start with this question.
[2929.12 --> 2930.32]  We're going to look at each one briefly.
[2931.64 --> 2932.66]  Relatively briefly.
[2934.00 --> 2935.34]  What is virtue?
[2936.72 --> 2947.24]  So according to Paul, writing to the church in Rome in the first century, a human being, a person, can go only about life in one of two directions.
[2947.80 --> 2951.60]  The path of virtue or the path of vice.
[2952.56 --> 2952.70]  Right?
[2952.84 --> 2956.08]  Virtue and its counterpart, vice, are paths.
[2956.18 --> 2957.26]  They're ways of living.
[2957.26 --> 2960.30]  They are ways that you can walk and follow.
[2960.64 --> 2965.98]  Now, the path of virtue is described in this text with words like this.
[2965.98 --> 2970.24]  I'm just going to name some of the words that I see as we read it.
[2970.58 --> 2971.16]  Awake.
[2972.40 --> 2973.04]  Salvation.
[2974.00 --> 2974.78]  Daytime.
[2975.66 --> 2976.94]  Armor of light.
[2978.00 --> 2979.16]  Behave decently.
[2980.16 --> 2981.76]  Clothe yourselves with Christ.
[2981.76 --> 2990.88]  And so it's this idea of being aware and open and innocent before God and other people.
[2992.04 --> 3004.58]  But then the opposite of that, the path of vice, is described in our text with words like slumber, night, deeds of darkness, gratify.
[3004.58 --> 3012.32]  And then there's this whole list of things, carousing and drunkenness, sexual immorality, debauchery, dissension, jealousy.
[3013.28 --> 3019.84]  And so he's describing here a life that is dark and hidden and selfish and violent.
[3019.84 --> 3027.48]  And so Paul is describing objectively about good and evil.
[3028.24 --> 3029.58]  There's goodness.
[3029.82 --> 3030.38]  There's evil.
[3030.54 --> 3031.02]  It's objective.
[3031.30 --> 3031.96]  It's clear.
[3031.96 --> 3040.78]  And what's interesting here is even if you don't agree with this biblical ethic that we see here,
[3041.56 --> 3049.64]  and no matter what your beliefs are, pretty much everybody agrees that being aware is better than having your senses dulled.
[3049.70 --> 3051.76]  No matter what religion you are, no matter what you believe.
[3053.26 --> 3058.36]  And that acting decently is better than acting selfishly and violently.
[3059.08 --> 3059.94]  We all agree with that.
[3059.94 --> 3062.42]  And that's the way God has made things, right?
[3062.50 --> 3063.54]  There is good and evil.
[3065.68 --> 3069.16]  Now there's a painting I want us to look at for a minute here.
[3070.06 --> 3073.34]  It's called The Allegory of Vice and Virtue.
[3073.44 --> 3075.18]  It was painted in the mid-16th century.
[3075.40 --> 3077.16]  And I know you can't see all the details.
[3077.50 --> 3078.02]  That's okay.
[3078.76 --> 3082.72]  I'm going to describe the main features of what's going on here.
[3083.58 --> 3089.36]  To the left, that side, you see the path of virtue.
[3089.94 --> 3093.28]  It leads to a home that's filled with light.
[3094.14 --> 3097.74]  And the path is narrow, at least narrower than the path on the right.
[3097.90 --> 3098.92]  But it is a good path.
[3100.20 --> 3104.64]  Now to the right is the path of vice.
[3104.90 --> 3110.70]  It leads to this dark, fiery hellscape of torment and suffering.
[3110.70 --> 3112.14]  And the path is broad.
[3113.10 --> 3114.16]  But it's bad.
[3115.40 --> 3117.52]  And so those paths diverge.
[3118.16 --> 3119.86]  All humans have a choice.
[3120.18 --> 3126.64]  The path of virtue, path of virtue on the side, or the path of vice, a path of goodness or a path of evil.
[3127.34 --> 3129.30]  One leads to safety and joy.
[3129.84 --> 3133.20]  The other leads to destruction and despair.
[3133.20 --> 3138.18]  And so here's a working definition of virtue.
[3139.16 --> 3142.48]  Virtue is a life of walking in the light that is God.
[3143.82 --> 3144.70]  That's what virtue is.
[3144.76 --> 3146.90]  That's what kind of the Christian life is about.
[3147.02 --> 3151.72]  Walking in the light that is God.
[3151.72 --> 3153.86]  It's a life of goodness.
[3154.26 --> 3158.96]  And not that kind of bland, rule follower kind of goodness.
[3159.28 --> 3166.30]  But a deep and a rich and a generous goodness that leaves a wake of goodness all around.
[3166.76 --> 3171.26]  It leaves a wake of healthy relationships and healthy families.
[3171.68 --> 3172.92]  And doing good work.
[3173.12 --> 3174.56]  And integrity and honesty.
[3175.06 --> 3177.42]  And loyalty and kindness and peacefulness.
[3177.42 --> 3180.42]  All these things that everybody wants.
[3181.14 --> 3182.90]  And that everybody wants to be around.
[3185.88 --> 3187.88]  So that's what virtue is.
[3189.42 --> 3191.14]  Now, why does it matter?
[3191.26 --> 3192.20]  That's our second question.
[3192.60 --> 3193.78]  Why does it matter?
[3193.84 --> 3196.60]  What's at stake here when we talk about this?
[3197.28 --> 3199.24]  And let's begin by just thinking about ourselves.
[3199.32 --> 3200.42]  What's at stake for ourselves?
[3200.66 --> 3207.10]  Why does it matter to us personally whether or not we're growing in virtue or whether we're kind of giving into vice?
[3208.36 --> 3212.32]  Well, for one, your own personal well-being is at stake.
[3213.38 --> 3215.10]  Paul says in verse 13,
[3216.16 --> 3219.20]  Let us behave decently as in the daytime.
[3220.74 --> 3224.32]  And he's describing a life here that's not crippled by shame.
[3225.14 --> 3229.34]  It's a life that is open to God and to others.
[3229.34 --> 3239.74]  And there's a sense of being an integrated human being where you're same on the outside in your behavior and your words as you are on the inside in your heart.
[3239.74 --> 3242.08]  And therefore, you have nothing to hide.
[3242.92 --> 3243.16]  Right?
[3243.22 --> 3244.10]  It's a life of integrity.
[3245.28 --> 3248.82]  But that's just in this life if you pursue virtue.
[3249.04 --> 3252.18]  There's also something at stake in the life to come, in eternity.
[3252.18 --> 3255.18]  And there is an eternal reward at stake.
[3255.72 --> 3262.72]  And there are many Bible verses that promise an eternal reward for those who live a life of virtue.
[3263.60 --> 3265.82]  1 Peter 5.4 is just one of them.
[3266.30 --> 3267.10]  It reads this.
[3267.76 --> 3272.34]  And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
[3272.34 --> 3302.32]  1 Peter 5.4 is just one of them.
[3302.34 --> 3302.80]  Right?
[3303.16 --> 3307.30]  So, verse 13 continues like this.
[3308.30 --> 3316.78]  Let us behave decently as in the daylight, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
[3318.22 --> 3321.78]  So, you might think to yourself, well, who really cares?
[3321.90 --> 3322.08]  Right?
[3322.08 --> 3331.24]  I mean, as long as things are done in private between consenting adults, why should it matter to me how my neighbor lives?
[3332.34 --> 3349.64]  And the simple answer is that to think that you can love your neighbor well while at the same time fighting and being jealous and acting out jealousy toward one another and using other people, you know, to satisfy your own appetites, that is an obvious contradiction.
[3349.64 --> 3353.28]  You cannot love your neighbor and do all of these things at the same time.
[3353.28 --> 3358.34]  And so, your growth in virtue is not only for your own well-being.
[3358.46 --> 3359.90]  It matters for your neighbor.
[3359.90 --> 3365.06]  But, you know, it also matters for the world, the common good of the world.
[3365.16 --> 3369.24]  You know, the world, we are all longing for peace and justice.
[3369.24 --> 3387.64]  And to think that you can achieve peace and justice in the world or that you can work for it or contribute to it, well, at the same time, being the kind of person described here is naive, if not completely dangerous and foolish.
[3388.92 --> 3390.10]  And so, your virtue matters.
[3390.18 --> 3394.10]  It matters for your own self-well-being, your life now and in eternity.
[3394.10 --> 3397.42]  It matters for the well-being of your neighbor and it matters for the world.
[3398.56 --> 3399.36]  So, that's why it matters.
[3399.52 --> 3400.96]  Now, here's our third question.
[3401.10 --> 3402.50]  Why is it so difficult?
[3402.94 --> 3404.88]  Why is virtue so difficult?
[3406.06 --> 3412.10]  Because if it matters, like we just said, then we ought to be properly motivated, right?
[3413.06 --> 3415.04]  We want the best for ourselves.
[3415.24 --> 3417.42]  We want the best for our neighbors and the world.
[3418.24 --> 3419.36]  Don't do we not.
[3419.36 --> 3424.80]  And if that's so, then why is growing in virtue so difficult?
[3426.24 --> 3429.30]  Well, there's an old comedian who said this.
[3430.38 --> 3435.36]  Stopping smoking is exactly as hard as taking up flossing.
[3437.50 --> 3442.06]  Stopping smoking is exactly as hard as taking up flossing.
[3442.06 --> 3443.56]  And the idea is this.
[3444.44 --> 3450.00]  Knowing that something is bad for you, like smoking, or good for you, like flossing your teeth,
[3450.20 --> 3455.10]  is not enough to get you to stop or to start doing it.
[3455.98 --> 3458.06]  And we all know this, right?
[3458.36 --> 3464.86]  Most of us tend to think, though, when it comes to our habits, our practices, our way of being in the world, how we live,
[3464.86 --> 3472.68]  that not only do we begin on neutral ground, but that we actually bring our own agency to the table,
[3472.74 --> 3475.54]  that we can make our own decisions, we can choose freely.
[3477.46 --> 3482.34]  And so we imagine it should be pretty easy to choose virtue over vice.
[3483.34 --> 3485.64]  But the reality is it's not the way it works.
[3485.86 --> 3487.20]  We know that from experience.
[3487.96 --> 3488.12]  Right?
[3488.22 --> 3493.14]  For one, we're not on neutral ground because of the effects of sin in our hearts.
[3493.14 --> 3502.44]  It's far easier for us to just slouch towards vice than it is to climb upward, the upward hill toward virtue.
[3504.34 --> 3506.48]  And then it's not just a matter of our own decisions.
[3506.70 --> 3514.90]  We're also being influenced and shaped by someone or something else, or many someones, or many somethings else.
[3515.84 --> 3519.60]  And all of these things, so whether our own inclinations, our own desires,
[3519.60 --> 3525.72]  our own habits that we've already grown into, or the people and the influences around us,
[3525.76 --> 3530.10]  they are all shaping us into the kind of person that you already are.
[3531.08 --> 3533.66]  And the character that you already currently possess.
[3533.66 --> 3536.82]  So that's why growth is so virtue.
[3537.42 --> 3539.26]  So growth in virtue is so hard.
[3540.54 --> 3541.34]  And so what do we do?
[3541.76 --> 3544.60]  We are entrenched in our ways.
[3545.62 --> 3548.50]  You know, you think about your spouse, your family, they're just stuck in their ways.
[3549.14 --> 3551.94]  Your neighbor, your coworker, yourself.
[3552.76 --> 3557.18]  How do we actually grow and change in virtue?
[3557.18 --> 3560.02]  It's so hard.
[3560.12 --> 3560.60]  And so what do we do?
[3560.62 --> 3561.80]  We look for a shortcut, right?
[3562.36 --> 3563.08]  We need a shortcut.
[3563.82 --> 3568.44]  And the shortcut is to try to take virtue and just kind of stick it on the outside.
[3568.80 --> 3570.98]  Kind of like pulling on a hoodie, putting on a coat.
[3574.10 --> 3577.30]  You know, and so like for that person that we find really annoying,
[3577.60 --> 3579.28]  we just like do our best to be friendly.
[3580.82 --> 3583.36]  But we know that it's not really authentic.
[3583.36 --> 3586.66]  We know that we ought to be living from the inside outside.
[3587.34 --> 3590.62]  That we ought to then say with our mouths, do with our actions,
[3590.62 --> 3593.24]  what is genuinely in our hearts.
[3594.46 --> 3600.32]  But the reality is, again, those inner thoughts and desires are twisted and bent by sin.
[3601.40 --> 3605.38]  And the best that I can actually do is just pretend to say and do the right things.
[3606.94 --> 3611.02]  But, you know, I don't need the Bible or Jesus to tell me that's a problem.
[3611.02 --> 3616.06]  Even Confucius tells me that's a problem.
[3616.52 --> 3617.68]  Here's a quote.
[3618.76 --> 3619.80]  Confucius says,
[3620.28 --> 3623.18]  The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly,
[3623.92 --> 3626.90]  but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous.
[3629.12 --> 3630.32]  Say that again.
[3631.46 --> 3634.98]  The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly,
[3635.54 --> 3640.44]  but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous.
[3641.02 --> 3641.62]  Right?
[3641.70 --> 3645.78]  Because true virtue is not something you can perform.
[3645.90 --> 3647.68]  It must come from the heart.
[3649.00 --> 3650.62]  So why is virtue so difficult?
[3650.98 --> 3656.68]  It's because Christian virtue requires us not just to act virtually,
[3657.32 --> 3657.82]  virtuously,
[3658.10 --> 3661.96]  but to genuinely be virtuous
[3661.96 --> 3665.40]  in our hearts, in our minds, in our thoughts, in our actions.
[3665.40 --> 3668.62]  But that's hard.
[3669.70 --> 3671.70]  So how can we get it?
[3671.74 --> 3672.54]  Our last question.
[3673.22 --> 3673.96]  How can we get it?
[3673.98 --> 3676.40]  How can I actually grow in the Christian life?
[3676.40 --> 3683.06]  How can I become truly virtuous in my heart
[3683.06 --> 3686.14]  so that my speech and my behavior,
[3686.68 --> 3689.40]  that wake of goodness that I want to leave in the world
[3689.40 --> 3691.30]  actually comes from who I am
[3691.30 --> 3695.48]  as a person of integrity and wholeness?
[3695.48 --> 3698.96]  Let's look again, if you will humor me,
[3699.08 --> 3701.12]  at that art that I showed you earlier.
[3701.56 --> 3703.40]  I know it's not pleasant to look at.
[3704.16 --> 3705.06]  It's kind of ugly.
[3705.54 --> 3706.32]  It's kind of terrible.
[3707.02 --> 3709.52]  But it's helpful for what we're talking about.
[3711.36 --> 3713.46]  And there's something true about this painting
[3713.46 --> 3715.16]  and there's something false about this painting.
[3716.88 --> 3718.24]  Here is what is true.
[3718.24 --> 3721.64]  It says that there is a true choice
[3721.64 --> 3723.26]  between vice and virtue.
[3724.28 --> 3727.82]  And that choice does lead to eternal reward
[3727.82 --> 3729.66]  or eternal damnation.
[3729.92 --> 3730.64]  That is true.
[3732.08 --> 3734.26]  The problem with this truth
[3734.26 --> 3737.64]  is that if I reflect on my own life,
[3737.70 --> 3738.94]  speaking personally here,
[3739.70 --> 3740.90]  in my own heart,
[3741.26 --> 3744.34]  it's not always clear to me which path I'm on.
[3745.90 --> 3746.14]  Right?
[3746.14 --> 3748.58]  Some moments, some days,
[3748.68 --> 3750.60]  I feel like I'm living pretty virtuously.
[3750.80 --> 3751.68]  I'm not bad.
[3752.34 --> 3753.34]  Other days,
[3753.78 --> 3756.64]  I kind of feel like sin has got its hooks in me.
[3758.52 --> 3759.36]  I'm speaking.
[3759.86 --> 3761.40]  I'm not speaking well to others.
[3761.50 --> 3762.74]  I'm not acting well.
[3763.64 --> 3765.96]  Sometimes it feels like I have one foot on each path
[3765.96 --> 3768.20]  and I'm just kind of being pulled further and further apart.
[3769.76 --> 3771.26]  Left to myself,
[3772.02 --> 3774.32]  if I'm just trying to live a virtuous life
[3774.32 --> 3775.70]  by my own strength,
[3776.14 --> 3777.58]  I'm not confident
[3777.58 --> 3780.22]  that I will make it to that house of safety
[3780.22 --> 3781.16]  and of joy.
[3783.14 --> 3786.10]  But this is where the painting lies.
[3787.38 --> 3788.48]  Here's how it lies.
[3789.06 --> 3790.38]  Here's where is God
[3790.38 --> 3791.66]  in this painting?
[3793.88 --> 3795.12]  He's up in the sky.
[3795.98 --> 3797.84]  His hands are outstretched.
[3798.30 --> 3799.56]  He offers a choice.
[3799.56 --> 3805.62]  This is a God who judges and evaluates from a distance.
[3806.24 --> 3809.28]  It's a picture of God that is actually quite familiar to us.
[3809.52 --> 3812.42]  That's kind of come down to us through the centuries
[3812.42 --> 3815.56]  to shape our imaginations of who God is,
[3815.72 --> 3819.24]  but that actually is quite far from the gospel.
[3819.24 --> 3824.06]  But the good news is that that is not the God of the Bible.
[3825.56 --> 3829.20]  The biblical story tells us of a God who comes down,
[3829.82 --> 3832.96]  of a God who doesn't remain at a distance,
[3833.68 --> 3834.98]  but who comes down,
[3835.08 --> 3837.84]  who becomes human in the person of Jesus Christ,
[3837.84 --> 3841.16]  and who was faced with the same choices
[3841.16 --> 3843.52]  that you and I face,
[3843.86 --> 3845.60]  the choices of virtue or vice.
[3846.36 --> 3847.52]  And Jesus, friends,
[3847.60 --> 3851.94]  is the one who chose virtue every single time.
[3852.80 --> 3855.28]  Again and again and again
[3855.28 --> 3857.90]  in this perfect, unbroken chain
[3857.90 --> 3860.76]  of virtuous words and virtuous actions.
[3860.76 --> 3862.86]  And then,
[3863.54 --> 3866.26]  through his sacrificial death and resurrection,
[3866.68 --> 3868.52]  he credits his virtue
[3868.52 --> 3870.60]  to us,
[3870.72 --> 3872.70]  the broken and then corrupt people
[3872.70 --> 3874.54]  who can't do it on their own.
[3875.52 --> 3877.38]  Creating a bridge of escape
[3877.38 --> 3880.10]  for us from hell to heaven
[3880.10 --> 3880.98]  for all those
[3880.98 --> 3882.76]  who would take him up on the invitation.
[3884.02 --> 3885.10]  Friends, that is the invitation
[3885.10 --> 3886.62]  that Jesus makes possible for us.
[3887.92 --> 3890.06]  And Jesus also makes it possible
[3890.06 --> 3892.34]  for us to grow in virtue as well.
[3892.96 --> 3893.18]  Right?
[3893.22 --> 3895.26]  Because not only did he put us on that path
[3895.26 --> 3897.30]  of eternal reward,
[3897.74 --> 3899.56]  crediting us with his own righteousness,
[3900.02 --> 3901.70]  but then he begins to change us
[3901.70 --> 3902.38]  from the inside.
[3903.46 --> 3903.72]  Right?
[3903.80 --> 3905.82]  So in John chapter 15,
[3905.90 --> 3906.74]  Jesus says this.
[3907.64 --> 3907.90]  He says,
[3908.06 --> 3909.34]  I am the vine,
[3910.14 --> 3911.96]  you are the branches.
[3912.52 --> 3914.22]  If you remain in me
[3914.22 --> 3915.30]  and I in you,
[3915.30 --> 3916.54]  you will bear much fruit.
[3917.52 --> 3918.70]  Apart from me,
[3918.70 --> 3920.88]  you can do nothing.
[3923.18 --> 3925.18]  The invitation from Jesus
[3925.18 --> 3926.62]  is to come and be with him.
[3927.22 --> 3928.38]  To abide with him.
[3928.46 --> 3929.54]  To enjoy him.
[3930.74 --> 3932.04]  And that as we do so,
[3932.10 --> 3933.98]  as we're abiding in Christ,
[3934.14 --> 3937.58]  connected to the source of life itself,
[3938.24 --> 3940.32]  then the virtues of God
[3940.32 --> 3943.02]  will flow from Jesus
[3943.02 --> 3944.38]  into you
[3944.38 --> 3946.12]  through the work of the Holy Spirit
[3946.12 --> 3946.78]  in your life
[3946.78 --> 3948.64]  in a way that is genuine.
[3949.62 --> 3949.88]  Friends,
[3949.94 --> 3950.96]  that's how we grow in virtue.
[3951.04 --> 3953.38]  It's not by striving as hard as we can.
[3953.94 --> 3955.52]  It's by abiding in Jesus.
[3957.18 --> 3958.30]  So let's abide
[3958.30 --> 3960.52]  in Jesus this year.
[3961.24 --> 3962.32]  Let's not get stressed out
[3962.32 --> 3964.32]  about how can we grow more
[3964.32 --> 3965.18]  in our Christian faith.
[3965.30 --> 3966.46]  This is the way.
[3966.60 --> 3967.28]  This is the secret.
[3968.28 --> 3969.24]  Just enjoy God.
[3969.96 --> 3971.10]  Enjoy being with him
[3971.10 --> 3972.30]  in Bible study and prayer.
[3972.78 --> 3974.30]  Enjoy being with him in worship.
[3974.30 --> 3976.78]  Abide in him
[3976.78 --> 3978.62]  and he will bear fruit
[3978.62 --> 3979.28]  in your life.
[3980.32 --> 3981.16]  So let's pray.
[3983.70 --> 3984.52]  Heavenly Father,
[3984.64 --> 3985.58]  we thank you that
[3985.58 --> 3987.22]  you do not remain
[3987.22 --> 3988.52]  just at a distance
[3988.52 --> 3990.60]  offering us this choice
[3990.60 --> 3991.46]  of good and evil,
[3992.02 --> 3995.16]  but that you come to us in Jesus.
[3996.02 --> 3997.32]  That you have been virtuous
[3997.32 --> 3998.50]  on our behalf.
[3998.86 --> 3999.84]  And that your virtue
[3999.84 --> 4001.28]  can be credited to us
[4001.28 --> 4002.52]  through the life,
[4002.68 --> 4003.30]  death, and resurrection
[4003.30 --> 4003.92]  of Jesus.
[4004.80 --> 4005.72]  And thank you, Lord,
[4005.78 --> 4006.60]  that you invite us
[4006.60 --> 4007.80]  to abide in you.
[4009.06 --> 4010.26]  Help us to do so, Lord,
[4010.30 --> 4011.12]  for our sakes,
[4011.54 --> 4012.52]  for our neighbors,
[4013.08 --> 4013.90]  and for the world.
[4014.74 --> 4016.08]  By your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[4016.20 --> 4017.08]  would you work in us.
[4017.20 --> 4017.66]  We pray
[4017.66 --> 4019.66]  in Jesus' name.
[4020.14 --> 4020.40]  Amen.
[4020.40 --> 4020.50]  Amen.
[4024.50 --> 4025.40]  Thank you for
[4025.40 --> 4027.36]  listening to
[4027.36 --> 4028.40]  a long message.
[4029.72 --> 4030.88]  On a New Year's Day,
[4030.88 --> 4031.98]  I thought to make it shorter,
[4032.10 --> 4032.80]  but I just couldn't.
[4033.94 --> 4034.84]  So, sorry.
[4036.14 --> 4037.08]  Let's stand, though,
[4037.12 --> 4038.40]  and let's sing a song together.
[4038.52 --> 4039.52]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4039.52 --> 4039.56]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4039.56 --> 4063.02]  When I fear my faith will fail,
[4063.02 --> 4064.02]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4064.02 --> 4065.02]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4065.02 --> 4067.42]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4067.42 --> 4069.36]  When the temptation
[4069.36 --> 4071.52]  would prevail,
[4072.52 --> 4075.78]  He Will Hold Me Fast.
[4076.44 --> 4080.40]  I can never keep my Lord
[4080.40 --> 4084.32]  through life's fearful path.
[4084.86 --> 4088.62]  For what all is often for,
[4088.62 --> 4091.26]  He will hold me fast.
[4091.26 --> 4093.14]  He will hold me fast.
[4093.14 --> 4097.18]  He will hold me fast.
[4097.18 --> 4101.04]  He will hold me fast.
[4101.04 --> 4103.46]  For what all is often for,
[4103.46 --> 4109.46]  He will hold me fast.
[4109.46 --> 4126.42]  He Will Be争
[4126.42 --> 4127.86]  Will Hold Me Fast.
[4127.86 --> 4129.82]  He will hold me fast.
[4130.36 --> 4134.28]  If not when my soul be lost,
[4134.58 --> 4138.48]  his promises shall last.
[4138.96 --> 4143.08]  Now my message and voice,
[4143.54 --> 4147.04]  he will hold me fast.
[4147.54 --> 4150.96]  He will hold me fast.
[4151.32 --> 4154.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4154.72 --> 4158.72]  For my Savior was his soul,
[4159.66 --> 4165.10]  he will hold me fast.
[4166.10 --> 4170.90]  Through all our deep heaven and high,
[4171.32 --> 4174.84]  Christ will hold me fast.
[4175.40 --> 4178.72]  Justice has been satisfied,
[4180.02 --> 4182.72]  he will hold me fast.
[4182.72 --> 4186.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4187.72 --> 4190.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4191.72 --> 4195.72]  Till our faith has turned to sound,
[4196.44 --> 4198.72]  when it comes to us.
[4199.72 --> 4202.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4202.72 --> 4203.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4203.72 --> 4206.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4206.72 --> 4207.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4207.72 --> 4211.72]  For my Savior was his soul,
[4211.72 --> 4215.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4215.72 --> 4219.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4219.72 --> 4223.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4223.72 --> 4227.72]  For my Savior was his soul,
[4228.72 --> 4232.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4232.72 --> 4233.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4233.72 --> 4239.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4239.72 --> 4241.72]  He will hold me fast.
[4241.72 --> 4248.18]  You may be seated.
[4250.92 --> 4255.64]  There is no offering for today, but we will come to the Lord in prayer.
[4255.64 --> 4263.06]  So let me lead us as we ask for the Lord's guidance and blessing as we begin this new year.
[4263.16 --> 4263.96]  Let's pray together.
[4265.94 --> 4270.98]  Ancient of days, we acknowledge before you that we are not our own.
[4271.72 --> 4273.82]  We are not the author of our lives.
[4274.46 --> 4276.60]  We are not the captains of our destinies.
[4277.68 --> 4283.38]  And so we renounce all claim to our own plans for our lives, all desires.
[4284.52 --> 4285.92]  We belong to you.
[4286.20 --> 4287.72]  We are yours alone, O Lord.
[4288.74 --> 4295.90]  And our prayer, Heavenly Father, is that you would lead us by your mercy through the gift of this coming year.
[4295.90 --> 4309.66]  May all the days of this year, the ordinary, small, and dull, the aching and bruised days, those days that are brimming over with goodness and joy,
[4310.64 --> 4315.46]  would they each one be a part of the story that your grace is writing in our lives?
[4315.46 --> 4327.52]  Lord, would you shape our vision and teach us by your Holy Spirit so that we might learn your story and see our place in it?
[4329.60 --> 4333.28]  Prepare our bodies, Lord, for the labors of this coming year.
[4334.38 --> 4338.44]  Give us strength and health to complete all that you put before us.
[4338.44 --> 4342.86]  Prepare our minds for the demands of this year, Lord.
[4342.98 --> 4346.04]  Grant us clarity, creativity, and discernment.
[4347.38 --> 4354.18]  Prepare our souls for this coming year as we face sorrows and joys and celebrations and disappointments,
[4354.60 --> 4358.62]  that every circumstance would only serve to draw us closer to you.
[4358.62 --> 4366.44]  Lord, may our words and choices and actions this year be offered as true expressions of worship.
[4367.64 --> 4371.60]  Help us, O Lord, not to waste a moment in the days of this year ahead.
[4372.44 --> 4381.16]  Let all that happens be as tools in your hands to shape us and conform us more into the image of Jesus, our Savior.
[4381.16 --> 4389.16]  Nothing is too hard for you, Lord Jesus, and so we place all confidence in you that whatever these days bring,
[4390.20 --> 4397.24]  we are kept and sheltered in your care, and that in all things your grace will sustain us because you are our rock and our redeemer.
[4398.20 --> 4406.42]  Spirit of God, as we look to the calendar and see 365 squares on that calendar,
[4406.42 --> 4411.96]  many of them may be filled in, many yet remain unmarked.
[4412.62 --> 4419.26]  Would you providentially ordain all things that come to the praise of your glory?
[4419.78 --> 4422.02]  We pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[4425.98 --> 4426.72]  Let's stand.
[4427.00 --> 4428.66]  Did you hear that knocking the whole time?
[4430.08 --> 4431.34]  Is it a bird? A woodpecker?
[4433.68 --> 4434.76]  Okay, let's stand.
[4434.76 --> 4436.28]  It's like spiritual warfare.
[4436.40 --> 4436.92]  What is happening?
[4437.54 --> 4438.36]  Trying to pray.
[4439.46 --> 4439.86]  All right.
[4440.24 --> 4442.56]  I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4443.56 --> 4451.60]  Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his gracious presence without fault and with great joy.
[4452.24 --> 4458.60]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[4459.00 --> 4461.92]  before all ages, now and forevermore.
[4462.48 --> 4462.84]  Amen.
[4464.76 --> 4469.82]  Amen.
[4470.20 --> 4470.40]  Amen.
[4470.40 --> 4470.92]  Amen.
[4482.92 --> 4484.52]  Amen.
[4485.04 --> 4487.74]  Amen.
[4491.92 --> 4493.76]  Amen.
[4493.76 --> 4502.76]  Praise Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[4502.76 --> 4505.76]  Amen.
[4523.76 --> 4525.76]  Amen.
[4553.76 --> 4555.76]  Amen.
