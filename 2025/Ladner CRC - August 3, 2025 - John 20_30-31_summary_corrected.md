• Pastor Jason preaches on the Gospel of John, citing its complexity and simplicity
• He emphasizes the importance of listening for the main theme in the book
• The sermon text is John 20:30-31, which states that Jesus' purpose was to give them life
• The purpose of John's gospel is to show that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God, and that believing this gives eternal life
• The book of signs refers to seven miracles performed by Jesus mentioned in John's gospel, which are considered more significant than other miracles because they reveal who Jesus is
• These seven signs include turning water into wine, healing a nobleman's son, Jesus walking on water, feeding 5,000 people, Jesus heals a blind man, Jesus gives sight to the man born blind, and raising Lazarus from the dead
• The concept of "signs" refers to actions or events that point to something deeper or more meaningful, like road signs pointing to a different reality
• Turning water into wine at Cana is the first sign mentioned in John's gospel and represents Jesus bringing joy and fulfilling the Jewish rite of purification
• This miracle symbolizes Jesus taking what was old and turning it into new, representing his mission to bring people from slavery to sin to the heavenly banquet
• The heavenly joy Christ wants to give us is different from simple happiness in this life.
• We often chase happiness at the expense of ourselves or our families, but true joy comes through focusing on God's kingdom.
• Jesus enacts a sign by taking our misery and turning it into joyful banqueting.
• The healing of the official's son in John 4 is a sign of faith.
• Followers of Jesus were not yet believing who he was despite seeing miracles and signs, but they wanted proof before they could believe.
• They wanted to control their lives and what they believed, holding Jesus hostage until he performed signs that worked out for them.

• He fulfills spiritual needs and gives true life
• Those with greatest physical needs often experience great joy and fullness in spirit
• Many people who have physical comforts are spiritually starving
• Finding provision in Jesus is essential for true satisfaction and fulfillment
• The phrase "Jesus had not yet joined them" is both physically true and symbolic.
• Physical darkness or a feeling of absence can be linked to Jesus' absence, symbolizing spiritual darkness.
• A miracle in the Bible tells of Jesus walking on water, approaching a boat, and calming the disciples' fear.
• True security and safety come from Jesus, not external sources like phones, alarms, or material possessions.
• External attempts at security often create a false sense of safety.
• True security can only be found through Jesus.

• The signs or messages associated with Lazarus' resurrection are discussed
