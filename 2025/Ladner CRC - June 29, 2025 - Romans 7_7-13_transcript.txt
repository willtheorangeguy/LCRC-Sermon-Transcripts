[120.00 --> 149.98]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 179.98]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 209.98]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 239.98]  Thank you.
[240.00 --> 269.98]  Thank you.
[270.00 --> 299.98]  Thank you.
[300.00 --> 329.98]  Thank you.

[359.98 --> 389.96]  Thank you.
[389.98 --> 419.96]  Thank you.
[419.96 --> 449.94]  Thank you.
[450.58 --> 455.34]  And also, if you have been involved in Sunday school as a teacher or an assistant today,
[455.58 --> 460.68]  after you get your buns and cookies, we're just going to have a brief debrief meeting just
[460.68 --> 464.58]  to talk about how the year went and as we consider the fall.
[464.58 --> 494.56]  So, please do join us, we're going to have a little bit of a little bit of a prayer, we're
[494.56 --> 508.50]  we're going to go there, let's go, let's just float in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of honor and let's do this.
[508.50 --> 515.46]  with us. So people of God, as God our Father calls us to worship Him this
[515.46 --> 522.96]  morning, let's hear His call to worship today from Psalm 29. Ascribe to the Lord,
[522.96 --> 530.10]  you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. Together, ascribe to
[530.10 --> 536.52]  the Lord the glory due His name. Worship the Lord in the splendor of His
[536.52 --> 542.94]  holiness. Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration? Let's pray together.
[542.94 --> 551.22]  The Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all of the earth. When we consider
[551.22 --> 556.58]  that your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon, and the stars which you
[556.58 --> 562.76]  have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of us, human beings that
[562.76 --> 568.70]  you care for us. But you, O Lord, showed us your care and your love for us by sending
[568.70 --> 574.56]  your Son, who being found in human form humbled himself by becoming obedient to
[574.56 --> 579.80]  the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore you, God, exalted Him to the
[579.80 --> 585.08]  highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name, that at the name of
[585.08 --> 590.42]  Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every
[590.42 --> 596.76]  tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. So would
[596.76 --> 601.58]  you now, Lord, lead us in this time of worship so that all that we say and do,
[601.58 --> 609.98]  all that is on our hearts and our minds, would give you glory. O Lord, our Lord, how
[609.98 --> 615.92]  majestic is your name in all the earth and all God's people said, Amen.
[615.92 --> 622.04]  So friends, in body or in spirit, as you are able, let's stand and let us hear God
[622.04 --> 630.48]  greet us this morning, also from Psalm 29. The Lord gives strength to His people, the
[630.48 --> 637.76]  Lord blesses His people with peace. May the peace of the Lord be with you. Would you
[637.76 --> 641.82]  turn and greet one another in that peace?
[667.76 --> 687.70]  God blesses His people with peace must have a face.
[687.70 --> 689.36]  Museum of a Peace of Peace.
[689.36 --> 689.90]  Again.
[689.90 --> 691.82]  See you then?
[691.82 --> 705.36]  We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[705.36 --> 712.36]  In grateful devotion, our training, we bring.
[712.86 --> 719.52]  We take before you, we kneel and adore you.
[719.52 --> 726.96]  We bless your Holy name, God, praise and sing.
[728.96 --> 735.90]  God, we praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[735.90 --> 741.90]  We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[741.90 --> 749.34]  God, we praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[749.34 --> 755.34]  God, we praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator.
[755.34 --> 758.22]  We praise you, O God.
[763.44 --> 776.92]  So raise your happy love, our Redeemer, Creator.
[777.40 --> 779.84]  Sing to it, O God.
[779.84 --> 789.66]  With voices you chant, our praises we've now filled.
[789.66 --> 797.06]  Our songs and thanks, given to sin without grace.
[797.44 --> 804.50]  Your son has led us, and God has beside us.
[804.50 --> 812.80]  To you, our mighty dear, for God be praised.
[834.50 --> 837.84]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[838.60 --> 841.64]  Open the eyes of your heart.
[841.64 --> 845.14]  I want to see you.
[845.92 --> 849.80]  I want to see you.
[851.80 --> 854.36]  Open my eyes of your heart.
[854.36 --> 864.50]  I want to see you.
[864.50 --> 866.50]  I want to see you.
[866.50 --> 871.50]  You see you, I'm the only one way.
[871.50 --> 901.48]  Open the eyes of your heart.
[901.48 --> 903.48]  I want to see you.
[906.04 --> 909.48]  Hold me, hold me, hold me.
[910.36 --> 913.62]  Hold me, hold me, hold me.
[914.62 --> 918.12]  Hold me, hold me, hold me.
[918.40 --> 921.68]  I want to see you.
[923.70 --> 927.48]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[927.74 --> 932.04]  Paul, we'll meet you.
[932.04 --> 933.18]  We'll meet you.
[933.18 --> 935.98]  I want to see you.
[937.26 --> 941.62]  I want to see you.
[942.62 --> 944.56]  shoots me, I want to see you.
[944.56 --> 949.42]  I want you,篠 I want you.
[949.42 --> 956.42]  I have to meet you. I have to see you.
[968.42 --> 972.70]  So this morning we've come together to worship and praise our God,
[972.82 --> 976.48]  to have the eyes of our hearts open by our Lord.
[976.48 --> 985.88]  But we've also come to allow and even to invite God's word and his Holy Spirit to confront us,
[986.02 --> 995.44]  to challenge us, to expose us in our sin, but then to restore us and to assure us of God's love and grace
[995.44 --> 1000.18]  and the forgiveness that is available so freely to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1000.18 --> 1007.06]  And so as a call to confession this morning, I want to read from Colossians chapter 3 verses 9 to 11.
[1007.56 --> 1014.18]  And as I read this, please ask the Holy Spirit to show you, to show each of us,
[1014.58 --> 1020.14]  the ways in which we need to confess our sins to the Lord based on his word.
[1020.14 --> 1022.90]  So let's hear God's word.
[1024.54 --> 1031.82]  Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices
[1031.82 --> 1038.08]  and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator.
[1038.08 --> 1047.38]  Here, there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free,
[1048.06 --> 1051.64]  but Christ is all and is in all.
[1053.12 --> 1056.54]  So please join me in a prayer of confession as I lead us in prayer.
[1056.54 --> 1065.24]  All knowing God and Father, you have searched us and you know us.
[1066.06 --> 1071.30]  You see every deed, hear every word and discern every thought of our hearts.
[1072.32 --> 1080.78]  You know our hidden faults and you see our secret sins, our pride, our lust, envy and bitterness, ingratitude and unbelief.
[1080.78 --> 1088.12]  In your great mercy, O Lord, cover our transgressions in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[1088.82 --> 1096.86]  Forgive us the sin within and renew us by your spirit so that we may walk in the ways of everlasting life.
[1097.52 --> 1101.10]  We pray and thank you in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[1102.44 --> 1110.06]  And friends, in response to our cries for mercy, God is not silent, but he responds with his amazing grace.
[1110.06 --> 1114.96]  And so receive these words of assurance from Colossians 3, verses 1 to 3.
[1116.50 --> 1119.02]  Since then you have been raised with Christ.
[1119.84 --> 1125.22]  Set your hearts on things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[1125.88 --> 1129.50]  Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
[1130.24 --> 1136.40]  For you died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God together.
[1136.40 --> 1145.20]  When Christ, who is our life, appears, then we will also appear with him in glory.
[1145.74 --> 1146.72]  Thanks be to God.
[1147.02 --> 1149.38]  Let's stand and let's sing a song of response together.
[1149.38 --> 1164.80]  In Christ alone, my hope is found.
[1165.20 --> 1168.38]  He is my light, my strength, my song.
[1168.38 --> 1177.38]  This cornerstone, this solid cloud, firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
[1178.38 --> 1182.66]  But I shall love the depths of peace.
[1182.86 --> 1186.38]  And fears are still, then striving cease.
[1187.38 --> 1191.38]  My love for earth, my all is all.
[1191.38 --> 1196.38]  Here in the love of Christ, my stand.
[1196.38 --> 1215.84]  Let's sing queues.
[1215.84 --> 1224.34]  , in Sunday, Jesus Queen God
[1224.34 --> 1236.66]  , that ye are Razor Damage of His so-called그러 탄 곡 Hirobat
[1236.66 --> 1254.98]  Here in the ground, his body ray shines with a rule by darkness, and bursting forth in glorious day, up from the grave he knows again.
[1254.98 --> 1273.98]  And as he stands in victory, since curse has lost his hope on me, for I am his and his pride, and with the precious blood of Christ.
[1273.98 --> 1293.98]  A vision along the world, His land leads to mine to surrender, has nothing to point in debt, and sin is the whole of Jesus who hosts ninguém.
[1293.98 --> 1299.34]  without ourétique period, I will share with us.
[1299.34 --> 1302.98]  With my 몰라, you willöse the men,
[1302.98 --> 1306.96]  shepherd your heart,
[1306.96 --> 1309.86]  Gesot Daniel,
[1309.86 --> 1313.66]  let us pray for our speakers to God!
[1313.66 --> 1319.44]  It's rarぎ slash gift of God!
[1319.44 --> 1321.62]  Legend of G Taiwan
[1321.62 --> 1327.16]  where the side of God will follow
[1327.16 --> 1328.20] ***
[1328.20 --> 1332.36]  lips that warm Hell!
[1351.62 --> 1364.34]  So, congregation of Jesus Christ, today we have the great honor and privilege, and we are excited
[1364.34 --> 1374.46]  to celebrate the gift of God's gift of faithful leadership for us and his people. And so out of
[1374.46 --> 1384.10]  God's love for us, his people, he appointed leaders for his church. He gave leaders and he equipped
[1384.10 --> 1391.92]  these leaders by his Holy Spirit, and he gave these leaders for us so that we, as God's people,
[1391.92 --> 1400.06]  might grow in grace, so that we might learn to love and serve others and to share the good news
[1400.06 --> 1409.52]  of salvation with all people. And so what do elders do in the church? Well, elders are in many ways with
[1409.52 --> 1417.46]  the deacons, the governing council of the church, but elders in particular, they exercise the spiritual
[1417.46 --> 1424.74]  oversight of the church. They care for the spiritual well-being of God's people. And so for an elder,
[1424.74 --> 1433.64]  they must provide instruction in God's word. They must promote fellowship and hospitality amongst us
[1433.64 --> 1442.62]  as Christ's body. They must ensure good order in the church and encourage all of us to live for Christ
[1442.62 --> 1451.04]  in each of our walks of life, wherever the Lord takes us. And these tasks of an elder call for
[1451.04 --> 1456.10]  Christians who are not perfect because all of us are sinners, but it calls for Christians who are
[1456.10 --> 1463.70]  growing in Christ, who desire to know and love and follow Christ closely, and who will then exercise
[1463.70 --> 1473.64]  this high and holy calling with prayer and humility and trust in the Spirit who works in us and helps us
[1473.64 --> 1481.66]  and gives us his strength. And so today we will be installing Wilma Kulin and Philip Leo into their office
[1481.66 --> 1487.02]  and their terms of service. So may I invite Wilma and Philip to come up front here.
[1487.02 --> 1513.70]  Okay. Wilma has served as an elder before, right? For Philip, he has served as a leader in his church
[1513.70 --> 1519.44]  that he came from previously. But today this is to be the first time that he will be installed as an elder
[1519.44 --> 1528.32]  of our congregation. And this is especially meaningful today because Philip comes from our Chinese congregation.
[1529.36 --> 1535.08]  And it's always been our hope and desire that brothers and sisters from our Chinese congregation will
[1535.08 --> 1541.34]  come and they will become members of our church. And then eventually they will come to share in the leadership
[1541.34 --> 1550.32]  of our church. So we are especially happy for Philip to be joining us. And of course, not to diminish our joy
[1550.32 --> 1561.48]  and exclaim it also for Wilma to again just be willing to serve us, even after having done so at least once,
[1561.54 --> 1568.78]  if not more than once before. Okay. Or just once. Okay. And so I am going to ask them to take some vows.
[1568.78 --> 1575.90]  And so for each one, there will be four vows for each time, just say your answer, which is,
[1576.12 --> 1583.22]  I do, God helping me. Okay. I do, God helping me. So here's the first one. Do you believe that in the
[1583.22 --> 1588.54]  call of this congregation, God himself is calling you to this holy office?
[1588.54 --> 1599.88]  Do you believe that in the Old and New Testaments are the word of God, the only infallible rule of faith
[1599.88 --> 1608.86]  and life? Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all teaching
[1608.86 --> 1618.06]  which contradicts them? Do you promise to do the work of your office faithfully, in a way worthy of your
[1618.06 --> 1621.86]  calling, in its submission to the government and discipline of the church?
[1624.56 --> 1633.82]  Okay. If you couldn't hear, they said I do. So this is good. And so I'm going to give them a
[1633.82 --> 1641.88]  charge now. And afterwards, we will ask our current council members, officers of Elder and Deacon to
[1641.88 --> 1647.88]  come up and we'll lay hands on them. But first, the charge to you. I charge you as elders of this
[1647.88 --> 1653.68]  church to guard yourself and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you an overseer.
[1654.28 --> 1661.20]  Be a shepherd of the church of God, which Jesus bought with his own blood. Be a friend and a
[1661.20 --> 1669.38]  Christ-like example to children. Give clear and cheerful guidance to young people. Encourage the aged
[1669.38 --> 1676.20]  to persevere in God's promises. And by word and example, bear up God's people in their pain and
[1676.20 --> 1683.74]  their weakness. Celebrate their joys with them. Be compassionate yet firm and consistent in rebuke
[1683.74 --> 1690.88]  and in discipline. Know the scriptures which are useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training
[1690.88 --> 1698.88]  in righteousness. Pray continually for the church. And remember at all times that if you would truly
[1698.88 --> 1704.38]  give spiritual leadership in the household of faith, you must be completely mastered by your Lord.
[1705.96 --> 1712.72]  So may I invite our current office bearers, elders, and deacons to come up and we will lay hands
[1712.72 --> 1721.12]  on them and bless them and install them into this office. Here, maybe make some space.
[1721.12 --> 1742.22]  Okay, let's pray together.
[1742.22 --> 1750.86]  Our merciful Father in heaven, from whom all blessings flow, we thank you that you have provided
[1750.86 --> 1757.94]  leaders to serve our church. And as Wilma and as Philip assume this office of elder among us,
[1758.42 --> 1764.06]  we ask that you would fill them with your spirit. Would you guide them with your wisdom? And would you
[1764.06 --> 1771.92]  fill them with your grace? Give them everything they need to take up this task which none of us
[1771.92 --> 1781.30]  are equipped to do in our own strength. But Lord, you have made us under shepherds of the true
[1781.30 --> 1788.20]  shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ. And we serve in his name only and with his strength only. And so Lord,
[1788.26 --> 1795.16]  would you make them faithful workers in your vineyard so that your name would be honored and your church
[1795.16 --> 1803.86]  would grow up into the image of Jesus Christ. And we pray and ask in the name of Jesus our Lord. Amen.
[1805.46 --> 1806.72]  Let's give a round of applause.
[1811.04 --> 1811.66]  Thank you.
[1811.66 --> 1816.94]  And let's all stand and we're going to sing another song together.
[1821.04 --> 1830.58]  This is a song that we pray for a blessing for all of us, but especially for those that have been installed today
[1830.58 --> 1837.04]  and that the Spirit of God would fall afresh on them and minister through our body.
[1837.04 --> 1837.84]  Thank you.
[1837.84 --> 1837.90]  Thank you.
[1837.90 --> 1838.04]  Thank you.
[1838.04 --> 1838.18]  Thank you.
[1838.18 --> 1838.46]  Thank you.
[1838.46 --> 1838.52]  Thank you.
[1838.52 --> 1838.58]  Thank you.
[1838.58 --> 1838.62]  Thank you.
[1838.62 --> 1838.68]  Thank you.
[1838.68 --> 1839.18]  Thank you.
[1839.18 --> 1839.22]  Thank you.
[1839.22 --> 1839.70]  Thank you.
[1839.70 --> 1841.64]  Thank you.
[1841.66 --> 1871.64]  Thank you.
[1871.66 --> 1901.64]  Thank you.
[1901.66 --> 1931.64]  Thank you.
[1931.64 --> 1933.64]  Thank you.
[1933.64 --> 1934.64]  Thank you.
[1934.64 --> 1938.64]  Thank you.
[1938.64 --> 1940.64]  Thank you.
[1940.64 --> 1951.50]  So our children are dismissed to go to their classes,
[1951.50 --> 1955.86]  and our Chinese congregation are dismissed to go with Pastor Nancy
[1955.86 --> 1959.28]  to their sermon in Mandarin.
[1970.64 --> 1986.44]  So this morning, we are continuing on in our sermon series in the Book of Romans,
[1986.44 --> 1988.60]  and today we are in Romans chapter 7.
[1989.32 --> 1993.44]  So I will invite you to please turn there in your pew Bibles,
[1994.08 --> 1996.20]  so that you may follow along with me.
[2000.64 --> 2006.52]  And as soon as I get there, I'll tell you the page number.
[2009.56 --> 2012.32]  So on page 840, 840.
[2013.90 --> 2016.34]  Now sometimes you'll notice that as we read from our Bibles,
[2016.52 --> 2019.26]  and the words on the screen don't quite match all the time.
[2019.26 --> 2022.92]  That's because this is the 84 edition, this is the 2011 edition,
[2023.16 --> 2024.26]  but they're pretty close.
[2024.42 --> 2027.22]  But in case that's ever thrown you off, that is the explanation.
[2027.22 --> 2032.54]  But we are in Romans chapter 7, and so three weeks ago,
[2032.54 --> 2035.78]  we read the first part of Romans 7, verses 1 through 6.
[2036.10 --> 2040.54]  So today we will pick up in verse 7, and we'll read to verse 13.
[2041.60 --> 2045.16]  So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word, beginning in verse 7.
[2045.16 --> 2047.94]  What shall we say then?
[2048.54 --> 2050.26]  Is the law sin?
[2051.06 --> 2052.24]  Certainly not.
[2053.12 --> 2058.26]  Indeed, I would not have known what sin was, except through the law.
[2059.04 --> 2062.26]  For I would not have known what coveting really was,
[2062.26 --> 2064.80]  if the law had not said, do not covet.
[2065.70 --> 2069.86]  But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment,
[2070.44 --> 2073.02]  produced in me every kind of covetous desire.
[2073.02 --> 2076.78]  For apart from law, sin is dead.
[2077.78 --> 2081.60]  Once I was alive apart from law, but when the commandment came,
[2082.20 --> 2084.24]  sin sprang to life, and I died.
[2084.84 --> 2089.94]  I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
[2090.74 --> 2094.28]  For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment,
[2094.70 --> 2097.86]  deceived me, and through the commandment, put me to death.
[2097.86 --> 2103.66]  So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.
[2104.50 --> 2107.26]  Did that which is good then become death to me?
[2107.32 --> 2108.14]  By no means.
[2108.86 --> 2112.30]  But in order that sin might be recognized as sin,
[2112.80 --> 2115.56]  it produced death in me through what was good.
[2115.90 --> 2119.82]  So that through the commandment, sin might become utterly sinful.
[2119.82 --> 2121.82]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2124.02 --> 2128.22]  Would you join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[2129.54 --> 2134.66]  Our Father, we thank you for your word, which reveals to us who you are.
[2135.52 --> 2140.72]  And we thank you, Lord, that you have revealed yourself in such a way,
[2140.72 --> 2145.84]  not merely as a distant God speaking from the heavenly places,
[2146.40 --> 2150.62]  but you came and you entered into this world in the person of your Son,
[2150.84 --> 2155.76]  and you sent your Holy Spirit to be with us and to guide us into all truth.
[2156.84 --> 2159.94]  And so we ask that you would bless this passage to us,
[2160.24 --> 2163.00]  that we might know your grace and your salvation.
[2163.54 --> 2165.64]  For Jesus' sake, we pray.
[2165.94 --> 2166.26]  Amen.
[2166.26 --> 2166.38]  Amen.
[2169.38 --> 2172.80]  So I want to begin with an illustration.
[2174.16 --> 2178.04]  Let's say that someone stole a car.
[2178.78 --> 2179.66]  Okay, someone stole a car.
[2180.20 --> 2182.08]  And it was grand theft auto.
[2182.28 --> 2184.32]  So this is a really expensive car.
[2185.00 --> 2190.98]  And in fact, this person was on a string of stealing cars from Whistler to White Rock.
[2192.20 --> 2194.20]  Finally, though, they were caught.
[2194.78 --> 2195.84]  They were arrested.
[2195.84 --> 2200.66]  They were brought to trial, found guilty, and sentenced to prison.
[2201.84 --> 2207.68]  Okay, so now imagine if this man or woman who was caught and arrested and put in prison said this.
[2208.44 --> 2209.14]  You know what?
[2209.64 --> 2211.08]  It isn't my fault.
[2211.94 --> 2216.24]  If there wasn't a law that said do not steal cars, I wouldn't be in trouble.
[2216.44 --> 2217.32]  So I'm innocent.
[2217.50 --> 2218.90]  It's the law that's the problem.
[2220.62 --> 2222.36]  Now that would make no sense, would it?
[2222.36 --> 2222.76]  Right?
[2222.76 --> 2223.32]  Right?
[2223.40 --> 2234.38]  It's true that the law convicted and sentenced them, but the guilty person has no one to blame but themselves for their criminal behavior.
[2234.38 --> 2240.56]  And in effect, this is what Paul is getting at in our passage this morning.
[2240.56 --> 2248.34]  And so what Paul has actually been driving at back in chapter 6 and into chapter 7 is to say the problem isn't the law.
[2248.76 --> 2251.26]  The problem is us.
[2251.26 --> 2259.54]  And God actually, he gave us the law to show us that the law and following it is a dead-end street.
[2259.54 --> 2270.68]  God never intended any man or woman, either in the Old Testament or the New, to attain salvation based on keeping the law.
[2271.34 --> 2277.60]  The law is powerless in and of itself to actually save us or to change us.
[2277.92 --> 2281.58]  The law is holy, but it is powerless to make us holy.
[2281.58 --> 2289.74]  But what God wants to show us is that because that doesn't work, something else has to work.
[2290.24 --> 2293.12]  And that something else is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2294.08 --> 2297.12]  Okay, so the law, it doesn't save us.
[2297.86 --> 2299.26]  Instead, we need grace.
[2299.52 --> 2300.72]  We need the grace of our Lord.
[2301.40 --> 2307.44]  But then the question is, well, then what is the Christian's relationship with God's law?
[2307.88 --> 2308.92]  With God's commandments?
[2308.92 --> 2313.96]  And that is what Paul gets at or tries to address in our passage this morning.
[2314.12 --> 2317.78]  He tells us a few things about our relationship to the law.
[2318.52 --> 2323.38]  And so there's a couple things that I see in this passage that I want to bring out and share with you.
[2323.90 --> 2327.50]  And the first thing that we see is that the law is good.
[2328.30 --> 2329.44]  Okay, that the law is good.
[2329.46 --> 2330.60]  That's our first point this morning.
[2330.70 --> 2332.22]  The law is good.
[2332.96 --> 2336.74]  And so let's have a look at verse 7, our first verse in our passage.
[2336.74 --> 2339.00]  Paul writes,
[2339.78 --> 2354.60]  Okay, so Paul here, as he's done already a few times in the letter, right, is anticipating a question.
[2355.00 --> 2361.14]  A question that his hearers and his readers might have based on all that he's said so far.
[2361.14 --> 2371.66]  And so he's actually worried that people might get the wrong idea about what he's been saying and to come to think that maybe the law is actually bad.
[2372.84 --> 2381.16]  Now, when Paul talks about the law, when the Bible talks about the law, what he's talking about is simply God's commands for us.
[2381.16 --> 2390.08]  These are the rules that God has given us to teach us how to live, to guide us in our lives.
[2391.32 --> 2397.42]  But Paul has said, if you remember from a few weeks ago in the first part of chapter 7,
[2397.80 --> 2402.84]  Paul has said, hey, we need to be released from the law so that we can be married to Christ.
[2402.84 --> 2409.50]  And we need to be released from the law so that we can live now by the Spirit and serve the Spirit.
[2411.26 --> 2416.82]  And so basically, Paul is saying, well, the sooner we can be free from the law, the better.
[2417.80 --> 2421.52]  And so someone might say then, well, does this mean that the law is bad?
[2421.86 --> 2423.74]  Is the law sinful?
[2424.76 --> 2427.34]  And Paul says, absolutely not.
[2427.58 --> 2429.12]  The law is good.
[2429.12 --> 2438.20]  And in fact, if you look at what Paul says in verse 12, he says, so then the law is holy.
[2438.46 --> 2443.02]  And the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
[2444.04 --> 2449.54]  And actually, if we look ahead to our passage for next week, Paul says that the law is spiritual.
[2450.76 --> 2456.40]  And he says in verse 22, that in my inner being, I delight in God's law.
[2457.06 --> 2458.66]  I delight in God's law.
[2459.12 --> 2461.24]  Do you delight in God's law?
[2462.24 --> 2463.66]  Do I delight in God's law?
[2465.36 --> 2472.82]  Well, I would say that delight is not always the feeling I have when it comes to the law of God.
[2472.82 --> 2491.56]  You know, and especially maybe you've had a bad experience in the church where the law of God was rightly used, perhaps to rebuke you, to correct you, point out your sin, but without the grace and mercy that is then available to us through Christ.
[2491.56 --> 2500.50]  And then, you know, sometimes, no, I don't delight in the law of God because it tells me to do things that in my sinful nature, I don't want to do.
[2500.50 --> 2507.28]  But listen to how David talks about God's law.
[2507.40 --> 2509.60]  He talks about it so beautifully.
[2509.76 --> 2514.64]  I want to read these verses for us from Psalm 19.
[2515.02 --> 2516.90]  Psalm 19, verses 7 to 11.
[2516.90 --> 2521.30]  Listen to the way David in the Old Testament talks about the law of God.
[2521.30 --> 2551.28]  He says,
[2551.30 --> 2570.04]  So we see that not only Paul in the New Testament, but also David in the Old Testament as well.
[2570.64 --> 2573.92]  They both talk about delighting in the law of the Lord.
[2573.92 --> 2576.50]  And that is because of this.
[2577.26 --> 2580.98]  The law of God shows us who God is.
[2582.52 --> 2583.06]  Right?
[2583.22 --> 2586.92]  Paul said the law, the commandments are holy and righteous and good.
[2587.20 --> 2588.22]  That is who God is.
[2588.34 --> 2591.18]  God is holy and righteous and good.
[2591.82 --> 2599.84]  And God's law from the words of his mouth, his will, for us, his people, comes from who he is.
[2599.84 --> 2604.44]  And so the law is a revelation of who God is to us.
[2604.68 --> 2606.66]  And it says that God is perfect.
[2607.86 --> 2607.98]  Right?
[2608.02 --> 2613.02]  That God is trustworthy and that God is righteous, that he is radiant and pure.
[2613.64 --> 2617.56]  And a relationship with our God is more precious than gold.
[2617.94 --> 2618.16]  Right?
[2618.24 --> 2620.14]  And more than any money that we can make.
[2620.98 --> 2623.68]  A relationship with God is sweeter than honey.
[2623.68 --> 2627.58]  And the thing is, he offers all of this to us.
[2628.60 --> 2635.44]  And so Paul, just like David, they both see the goodness of God in the law and they see the beauty of God in the law.
[2635.90 --> 2638.44]  And so Paul says the problem is not the law.
[2639.36 --> 2640.20]  It's us.
[2641.18 --> 2641.32]  Right?
[2641.38 --> 2644.02]  So Paul would say to the law, it's not you, it's me.
[2644.98 --> 2645.92]  I am the problem.
[2646.52 --> 2647.38]  The law is good.
[2647.48 --> 2648.64]  The law is given by God.
[2648.64 --> 2650.28]  It reveals who God is.
[2650.82 --> 2655.92]  His desire for us, his people, to live and to reflect him in this world that he has made.
[2656.72 --> 2661.56]  But the law itself cannot force anyone to live the way that they should.
[2661.64 --> 2662.74]  It doesn't have that power.
[2663.74 --> 2665.72]  And so that brings us to our second point this morning.
[2666.08 --> 2672.70]  If the law doesn't actually have the power or the ability to change how we live, what is the purpose of the law?
[2673.58 --> 2674.26]  What is the purpose?
[2674.36 --> 2677.34]  And Paul says the law reveals sin.
[2677.34 --> 2678.94]  That's what he says here.
[2679.02 --> 2680.36]  So let's look again at verse 7.
[2682.10 --> 2682.66]  Paul says,
[2682.80 --> 2684.00]  What shall we say then?
[2684.48 --> 2685.28]  Is the law sinful?
[2685.42 --> 2686.10]  Certainly not.
[2686.26 --> 2691.78]  Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law.
[2692.36 --> 2699.46]  For I would not have known, for example, what coveting really was if the law had said you shall not covet.
[2703.32 --> 2707.04]  How do you know what sin is?
[2708.00 --> 2709.32]  Or how do you know what is sinful?
[2710.16 --> 2715.18]  Well, you need a standard to base it on.
[2715.30 --> 2717.22]  In a sense, you need a measuring stick.
[2718.16 --> 2719.92]  And think about it like this.
[2720.34 --> 2720.94]  It's summer.
[2721.38 --> 2723.44]  The kids maybe want to go to the water park.
[2723.80 --> 2726.76]  You know, sometimes they have that slide that's like the big kid slide.
[2726.76 --> 2728.82]  And what do they have right at the top of the slide?
[2729.92 --> 2736.38]  They have a sign with, you have to be this high to go on this roller coaster or to go down this water slide.
[2736.46 --> 2739.90]  So the kid gets up and they kind of measure themselves and stand on their tippy toes.
[2740.44 --> 2740.70]  Right?
[2740.78 --> 2742.36]  So they can go down the slide.
[2742.36 --> 2744.22]  How do you know if you're tall enough?
[2744.28 --> 2746.10]  Well, you need a standard, a measuring stick.
[2747.20 --> 2749.76]  How do you know if you passed your class in school?
[2750.72 --> 2759.34]  Well, there's a grading rubric that is held up to measure your understanding and your ability to, you know, understand the material.
[2759.34 --> 2767.22]  Well, in the same way, as human beings, how do we know if we're living according to God's will and who he is?
[2767.60 --> 2768.90]  Well, he's given us the law.
[2769.02 --> 2770.56]  And it's a measuring stick.
[2771.54 --> 2775.70]  And that is exactly what the Heidelberg Catechism tells us in question and answer number three.
[2777.74 --> 2778.02]  Ready?
[2778.52 --> 2778.96]  Congregation.
[2779.52 --> 2782.14]  How do we come to know, how do you come to know your misery?
[2783.24 --> 2785.38]  The law of God tells me.
[2785.38 --> 2796.38]  And so what the law tells me, right, when we measure ourselves by the law is that we fall into the category, every single one of us, of sinner.
[2797.40 --> 2802.46]  When we measure ourselves against the law, remember the law is holy, good, and righteous.
[2802.92 --> 2808.68]  And we stand next to that law, we see that we are not holy, good, and righteous.
[2808.68 --> 2810.46]  Not to the standard of who God is.
[2810.84 --> 2812.52]  And so we all fall in this category of sinner.
[2812.76 --> 2814.52]  Which simply means we don't measure up.
[2815.38 --> 2824.00]  And for Paul, what really made him aware of the reality of his sinful condition was the Tenth Commandment.
[2824.08 --> 2824.90]  He talks about that.
[2825.52 --> 2826.30]  What's the Tenth Commandment?
[2826.72 --> 2827.38]  Thou shall not...
[2829.76 --> 2831.30]  You have to count, right?
[2831.40 --> 2831.96]  Get to ten.
[2832.26 --> 2832.98]  Thou shall not covet.
[2834.32 --> 2835.26]  We'll have to do a review.
[2836.14 --> 2836.98]  For another day.
[2836.98 --> 2845.14]  Now, Paul, of course, when he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a law-keeping Jew, right?
[2845.20 --> 2847.72]  In fact, he was a Pharisee.
[2848.54 --> 2852.08]  And Paul says in the book of Philippians, chapter 3, verse 6,
[2852.08 --> 2853.98]  As far...
[2853.98 --> 2858.94]  As for righteousness based on the law, what?
[2860.60 --> 2861.04]  Blameless.
[2862.44 --> 2862.92]  Faultless.
[2862.92 --> 2865.06]  Can you imagine that?
[2865.18 --> 2869.82]  Someone saying, as to the law, I was blameless.
[2870.70 --> 2872.58]  And it's like the rich young ruler, right?
[2872.58 --> 2877.46]  He comes to Jesus and says, all of these things I have kept since my youth.
[2878.82 --> 2879.94]  Now, why are they saying that?
[2879.98 --> 2882.62]  It's because the way the Jews understood the law.
[2883.04 --> 2886.76]  That obeying the law was simply a matter of outward behavior.
[2886.76 --> 2888.94]  So, I did not kill anybody.
[2889.10 --> 2890.34]  I did not steal anything.
[2890.54 --> 2892.38]  You know, I have always kept the Lord's day.
[2892.46 --> 2893.24]  All of these things.
[2894.22 --> 2896.02]  And it wasn't so much about what's in your heart.
[2897.64 --> 2900.00]  But, thou shall not covet.
[2901.44 --> 2902.28]  That's internal.
[2902.98 --> 2903.14]  Right?
[2903.18 --> 2903.68]  That's internal.
[2903.84 --> 2904.66]  That's coveting.
[2904.94 --> 2905.34]  Wanting.
[2905.46 --> 2908.20]  What is not yours is something that happens in your heart.
[2908.26 --> 2910.02]  It's not something that people can see.
[2910.02 --> 2917.90]  Now, of course, Paul would have known the Tenth Commandment from being a young boy.
[2918.28 --> 2923.34]  But what happened was the day came when the Holy Spirit put all the pieces together for him.
[2923.80 --> 2926.54]  And for him, for Paul, that happened on the road to Damascus.
[2926.62 --> 2926.80]  Right?
[2926.88 --> 2928.26]  In the house of Ananias.
[2928.76 --> 2933.26]  When suddenly his eyes were opened and he was convicted of his sin.
[2933.90 --> 2937.02]  And he saw that, no, I am not blameless.
[2937.02 --> 2938.02]  I am not faultless.
[2938.02 --> 2938.78]  I am not faultless.
[2938.84 --> 2942.68]  In fact, I am a sinner before God.
[2942.98 --> 2944.64]  And that is what the law does.
[2945.22 --> 2949.08]  When it's accompanied by the Holy Spirit, it convicts us of sin.
[2949.94 --> 2957.08]  See, the law holds up a mirror and it tells us these things that you do, these things that are on your heart, they dishonor God.
[2957.40 --> 2958.38]  These things are sin.
[2959.12 --> 2960.92]  And it shows us the truth about ourselves.
[2961.06 --> 2962.26]  That is what the law is for.
[2964.28 --> 2965.96]  And so the law is good.
[2966.06 --> 2967.22]  It reflects God's character.
[2967.22 --> 2968.40]  The purpose of the law.
[2968.54 --> 2971.84]  One of the purposes of the law is to be a measuring stick to reveal our sin.
[2972.52 --> 2981.18]  And then the third thing that Paul says is not only does it reveal sin in us, it actually provokes it.
[2982.06 --> 2982.90]  This is interesting.
[2984.04 --> 2984.20]  Okay?
[2984.28 --> 2985.20]  So verse 8.
[2985.72 --> 2986.98]  Let's look at what Paul says.
[2987.84 --> 2989.36]  But, you know, continuing on.
[2989.36 --> 2992.96]  But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment.
[2993.04 --> 2994.08]  Okay, so here's the commandment.
[2994.18 --> 2995.44]  And sin is like, aha, okay.
[2996.44 --> 2999.06]  It produced in me every kind of coveting.
[2999.60 --> 3001.74]  For apart from the law, sin was dead.
[3001.74 --> 3012.10]  And so sin takes the law of God and it uses it to actually stir up sin within us.
[3012.10 --> 3022.28]  Because of our sinful nature, when we hear God's law and God's commandments, there's something inside of us that says, you know what?
[3023.10 --> 3024.52]  I want to go against that.
[3025.16 --> 3029.96]  I want to do just exactly what God said I shouldn't do.
[3029.96 --> 3033.52]  And so James Boyce, I'm reading it.
[3033.56 --> 3038.94]  Part of my preparations for the series of Romans is a pastor from Philadelphia named James Boyce.
[3039.00 --> 3040.50]  He has a commentary series.
[3041.10 --> 3042.84]  And he gave this personal illustration.
[3042.98 --> 3043.76]  I thought it was quite good.
[3045.82 --> 3046.80]  So he said this.
[3046.84 --> 3049.94]  One day at school, he was in grade 6.
[3050.84 --> 3056.28]  And the principal came into the classroom and said, you know what?
[3056.28 --> 3060.30]  We've had a problem with students bringing fireworks, firecrackers, to school.
[3061.46 --> 3065.08]  And the principal came in to say, that is definitely not allowed.
[3065.66 --> 3067.80]  Okay, do not bring firecrackers to school.
[3067.92 --> 3068.78]  They are dangerous.
[3068.94 --> 3070.14]  They are against state law.
[3071.10 --> 3072.66]  Don't bring firecrackers to school.
[3073.44 --> 3078.20]  And so James Boyce, as a grade 6 boy, he hadn't been thinking about firecrackers.
[3079.06 --> 3081.94]  But once you get thinking about them, well, they're pretty cool.
[3081.94 --> 3086.08]  So him and two of his buddies, they went home.
[3086.52 --> 3088.68]  They got some firecrackers that they had.
[3088.88 --> 3090.08]  And they brought them back to school.
[3091.02 --> 3093.36]  And then they went into a closet in the school.
[3094.22 --> 3096.18]  And I think they were just kind of playing with it.
[3096.20 --> 3097.80]  Or maybe they were going to light it, but put it out.
[3097.92 --> 3100.60]  But actually what happened is they set off a firecracker in the closet.
[3101.38 --> 3104.40]  It exploded with a huge blue cloud of smoke.
[3104.54 --> 3106.46]  Little bits of white paper went flying everywhere.
[3106.46 --> 3114.80]  And he said he could never imagine how loud a firecracker could be set off in an old school
[3114.80 --> 3118.30]  building with high ceilings and marble floors and plaster walls.
[3119.36 --> 3125.38]  And as the boys staggered out of the closet, he also said he could never imagine how fast
[3125.38 --> 3128.26]  a principal could come flying out of that office.
[3128.26 --> 3136.34]  And so once his parents were called to the office, he said he just remembers the principal saying over and over,
[3136.68 --> 3138.98]  I had just made an announcement.
[3139.68 --> 3143.62]  I had just told them not to bring firecrackers to school.
[3143.82 --> 3145.34]  I just can't believe it.
[3146.82 --> 3150.26]  And Boyce says that's when the principal became a believing Calvinist,
[3151.60 --> 3156.08]  at least concerning the total depravity of elementary school boys.
[3156.08 --> 3161.00]  But that is what the law does.
[3161.52 --> 3165.88]  You know, I wouldn't have thought to do this unless the law said not to do it.
[3165.92 --> 3166.80]  Now I want to do it.
[3167.22 --> 3168.44]  Like don't touch wet paint.
[3168.64 --> 3174.38]  You don't go around thinking about touching wet paint until there's a sign that says wet paint don't touch.
[3174.76 --> 3176.20]  You're like, hmm, I wonder what it is.
[3177.64 --> 3177.76]  Right.
[3177.76 --> 3186.46]  And so, you know, sin, and so it's not, the law is not the problem, but sin, it stirs up rebellion in us.
[3187.08 --> 3191.76]  Knowing God's law doesn't actually help us obey the law.
[3192.70 --> 3194.34]  It often even does the opposite.
[3195.22 --> 3195.44]  Okay.
[3195.60 --> 3199.24]  So, you know, God's law, it is good and it is holy.
[3199.56 --> 3200.80]  It shows us our sin.
[3200.80 --> 3205.52]  Sin takes a lot and it stirs up sin in us.
[3205.94 --> 3208.86]  But then the fourth thing we learn is that the law brings death.
[3210.50 --> 3214.80]  And this is what Paul goes on to say now in the next section, verses 9 through 11.
[3215.62 --> 3216.82]  So let's read this again.
[3216.82 --> 3221.44]  Once I was alive apart from the law.
[3222.38 --> 3229.08]  But when the commandment came or, you know, came home to him, sin sprang to life and I died.
[3229.62 --> 3236.02]  I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life, right, because it's in accordance with who God is,
[3236.60 --> 3239.04]  actually, because he can't keep it, brought death.
[3239.04 --> 3247.90]  For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me and through the commandment put me to death.
[3248.72 --> 3251.94]  The law killed me, is what Paul says.
[3252.16 --> 3256.04]  It convicted me that I am a sinner, right?
[3256.10 --> 3257.68]  I thought me and God were good.
[3257.80 --> 3258.88]  We were on a good standing.
[3259.76 --> 3260.86]  God told me what to do.
[3261.14 --> 3261.84]  I did it.
[3261.96 --> 3263.56]  I was a law-abiding Jew.
[3263.56 --> 3274.18]  But suddenly that sense of self-righteousness, that sense of his law-keeping, which made him feel alive with God,
[3274.44 --> 3276.98]  all of the wind went right out of that sail.
[3278.24 --> 3286.38]  And that sail was just kind of flapping in this light breeze, giving no power and no direction to the vessel of his life.
[3286.38 --> 3296.00]  And when Paul recognized that this was the way he was heading, trusting in his own self-righteousness, his law-keeping,
[3296.54 --> 3297.94]  it said it was a deception.
[3299.00 --> 3305.64]  And friends, when we think that, you know, we're just going to keep these laws and, you know, God's going to be pretty pleased with me,
[3306.56 --> 3309.42]  that is, Paul says, that is the deception of sin.
[3310.56 --> 3310.98]  Okay?
[3310.98 --> 3313.28]  It is the way of death.
[3314.42 --> 3316.50]  And that brings us to our very last point today.
[3317.14 --> 3318.94]  Five points, but each one is a little bit quicker.
[3320.92 --> 3322.66]  That the law points us to Christ.
[3323.32 --> 3323.68]  Okay?
[3323.70 --> 3324.98]  The law points us to Christ.
[3325.14 --> 3327.02]  And to our need for a Savior.
[3328.04 --> 3330.08]  And so let's look at our very last verse, verse 13.
[3331.54 --> 3332.20]  Paul says,
[3332.28 --> 3336.70]  Did that which is good, right, the law, then become death to me?
[3336.80 --> 3337.98]  So again, is like the law death?
[3338.02 --> 3339.00]  Does it lead to death?
[3339.08 --> 3339.46]  Is it sin?
[3339.46 --> 3341.34]  No, by no means.
[3342.10 --> 3350.16]  Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good, the law, to bring about my death,
[3350.20 --> 3355.02]  so that, through the commandment, sin might become utterly sinful.
[3356.62 --> 3358.44]  So here's what I think Paul is saying.
[3358.64 --> 3360.32]  It's kind of a confusing passage.
[3361.20 --> 3363.56]  He's saying, look, the law is good.
[3364.24 --> 3366.26]  It's a reflection of who God is.
[3366.26 --> 3369.52]  It tells us how he wants us to live in the world as his people.
[3370.58 --> 3374.72]  But the law, being good, it doesn't bring death.
[3375.08 --> 3375.92]  Sin brings death.
[3376.96 --> 3379.60]  The law was never meant to save us.
[3379.68 --> 3381.94]  It was simply meant to show us our sin,
[3381.94 --> 3384.38]  to reveal our sin,
[3384.64 --> 3388.92]  and to make it absolutely clear to us that our condition is completely hopeless,
[3389.20 --> 3391.18]  apart from the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3391.18 --> 3394.88]  It was meant to show us who God is,
[3395.04 --> 3396.46]  to show us our need,
[3396.88 --> 3397.52]  our sinfulness,
[3397.66 --> 3399.72]  so that now there's this great chasm
[3399.72 --> 3403.40]  as we grow in our knowledge of God's holiness and goodness,
[3403.68 --> 3406.70]  as we grow in our knowledge of the depths of our sin,
[3406.78 --> 3407.94]  the sinfulness of sin,
[3408.20 --> 3411.62]  this chasm gets bigger between God's holiness and our sin,
[3411.86 --> 3413.16]  and to bridge that gap,
[3413.26 --> 3416.76]  the cross becomes greater and greater in our hearts,
[3416.76 --> 3417.66]  and in our minds,
[3417.66 --> 3420.96]  as we see our need for grace.
[3424.08 --> 3429.48]  The law was given to drive out of us all self-righteousness,
[3429.48 --> 3432.70]  so that we can then hold on to Christ.
[3433.38 --> 3436.18]  And so let me give us a final illustration today.
[3436.18 --> 3439.52]  A truck is going down a highway.
[3440.78 --> 3444.98]  The truck careens off the road and into a ditch.
[3445.66 --> 3447.74]  The driver is pinned in the cab.
[3448.76 --> 3449.92]  And, you know, as people,
[3450.52 --> 3451.60]  they're also driving,
[3451.78 --> 3454.14]  and they see this truck go off the road into the ditch.
[3454.54 --> 3455.50]  People pull over.
[3455.66 --> 3458.38]  A crowd is starting to gather around the accident site.
[3458.58 --> 3463.12]  And a dozen strong men grab this hefty bumper of this truck,
[3463.12 --> 3465.08]  and they lift with all their might.
[3466.18 --> 3469.34]  The veins on their neck are, like, popping out, right,
[3469.40 --> 3473.22]  trying to lift this truck out of the ditch to rescue the driver.
[3473.78 --> 3475.44]  But it doesn't budge an inch.
[3475.54 --> 3477.34]  They're not strong enough to lift the truck.
[3478.08 --> 3480.32]  But then a wrecker comes with a big crane.
[3481.16 --> 3484.24]  And so this crane, it can lift the truck out of the ditch.
[3484.44 --> 3488.72]  But the only way it can do that is to attach to that bumper
[3488.72 --> 3491.08]  to lift it out of the ditch,
[3491.08 --> 3494.94]  to the very bumper that those 12 men are holding onto so tightly.
[3494.94 --> 3501.46]  They must move out of the way for that crane to then attach to that bumper
[3501.46 --> 3502.34]  to lift up the truck.
[3503.08 --> 3504.46]  And in a similar way,
[3504.58 --> 3507.78]  we try to use the law as a way to lift us up,
[3507.82 --> 3510.26]  to lift us up into the presence of God,
[3510.32 --> 3511.40]  out of the ditch we're in.
[3511.50 --> 3513.26]  But it doesn't budge us an inch.
[3513.26 --> 3518.64]  Only Christ, the crane,
[3519.78 --> 3524.52]  can attach to us and lift us out.
[3524.72 --> 3527.32]  But the thing, for Christ to do that in our lives,
[3527.36 --> 3529.74]  to lift us out of our sin,
[3530.40 --> 3534.16]  we need to let go of holding on to the law
[3534.16 --> 3536.74]  as that way that we are going to try to lift ourselves up.
[3537.06 --> 3538.38]  We have to let go of that.
[3538.38 --> 3544.18]  We have to move it aside so that Christ can lay a hold of us.
[3548.16 --> 3550.26]  The gospel, friends, the good news of Christ
[3550.26 --> 3553.28]  is that all who believe in Jesus Christ are rescued
[3553.28 --> 3557.12]  from that ditch that we cannot get out of ourselves.
[3558.48 --> 3560.12]  Would you please bow in prayer with me?
[3560.12 --> 3564.64]  Our God and our Heavenly Father,
[3564.82 --> 3566.88]  we thank you, Lord, for the truths of this passage.
[3567.06 --> 3569.34]  It's a confusing passage,
[3569.66 --> 3572.56]  and I know that I have not even scratched the surface.
[3573.54 --> 3575.54]  But, Lord, we trust that you alone,
[3575.64 --> 3576.84]  your Holy Spirit alone,
[3577.46 --> 3580.72]  can teach us that salvation is by grace
[3580.72 --> 3581.72]  and not by the law.
[3582.86 --> 3585.54]  We thank you, Lord, for the crane that comes along
[3585.54 --> 3588.80]  and it takes a hold of us and it lifts us up.
[3589.84 --> 3591.38]  And when we're back on the road,
[3591.46 --> 3593.50]  we can never boast again saying,
[3593.64 --> 3595.00]  we got ourselves out of that ditch.
[3595.74 --> 3599.04]  All we can say is that by grace that we were lifted up.
[3599.64 --> 3601.90]  And by grace, we will proceed.
[3603.48 --> 3605.66]  And, Lord, if there are any here among us
[3605.66 --> 3607.44]  this morning who need Christ,
[3608.10 --> 3610.80]  Father, I pray that just as you did for Paul
[3610.80 --> 3613.50]  and like you've done for us here who know you,
[3613.50 --> 3616.40]  would you bring them to an end of themselves,
[3617.32 --> 3619.82]  convict them of their sinful condition
[3619.82 --> 3622.32]  so that they would see their need for grace
[3622.32 --> 3623.50]  and their need for a Savior.
[3624.48 --> 3626.86]  We ask this, Lord, in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[3627.26 --> 3627.50]  Amen.
[3630.56 --> 3631.08]  All right.
[3631.66 --> 3634.96]  So let's stand and we'll sing a song together,
[3635.06 --> 3635.64]  a song of response.
[3643.50 --> 3665.96]  Before the throne of God above,
[3665.96 --> 3671.08]  I have a strong and perfect name,
[3671.44 --> 3675.44]  a great hand for each to save his blood,
[3675.82 --> 3679.72]  whoever lives and pleads for me.
[3679.72 --> 3684.36]  My name is great with all his hands,
[3684.62 --> 3688.74]  my name is great with all his heart,
[3688.94 --> 3692.98]  I know that I'm all in the heavenly stands,
[3692.98 --> 3697.20]  no tongue can make me this divine.
[3697.20 --> 3701.52]  No tongue can make me this divine.
[3704.32 --> 3708.58]  When Satan tells me to despair,
[3709.06 --> 3712.70]  and tells me of the guilt within,
[3713.14 --> 3717.20]  a word I look and see him there,
[3717.58 --> 3721.38]  who made it into all my sin.
[3721.38 --> 3726.00]  Because of sin as a Savior died,
[3726.34 --> 3730.30]  my sinful soul is counted free,
[3730.72 --> 3734.82]  for God the just is satisfied,
[3735.24 --> 3739.20]  to look on him and pardon me,
[3739.60 --> 3743.88]  to look on him and pardon me.
[3746.40 --> 3750.70]  Behold him there, the risen hand,
[3750.70 --> 3753.20]  my perfect spotless,
[3753.20 --> 3755.20]  my preciousness,
[3755.20 --> 3759.68]  the great unchangeable I am,
[3760.04 --> 3764.26]  the King of glory and of grace.
[3764.66 --> 3768.46]  But with himself I cannot die,
[3768.66 --> 3772.80]  my soul is purchased with his power,
[3772.80 --> 3777.42]  my life is made with Christ on high,
[3777.42 --> 3781.84]  with Christ my Savior and my God,
[3782.14 --> 3786.80]  with Christ my Savior and my Lord.
[3786.80 --> 3793.56]  I bow before the cross of Christ,
[3793.56 --> 3797.96]  and marble and happiness of divine,
[3798.18 --> 3801.80]  God's perfect son was sacrificed,
[3802.80 --> 3807.16]  to make me righteous in God's eyes.
[3807.40 --> 3810.80]  His first action cannot know,
[3810.80 --> 3813.30]  but I can't know,
[3813.30 --> 3813.80]  but I can't know,
[3813.80 --> 3815.30]  and give his blood,
[3815.30 --> 3818.44]  the Lord most high,
[3818.50 --> 3820.64]  as his bow down low,
[3821.18 --> 3822.80]  and born on me,
[3822.80 --> 3825.32]  his glory is God,
[3825.74 --> 3827.56]  and born on me,
[3827.56 --> 3830.24]  his glory is God.
[3830.24 --> 3832.96]  Amen.
[3832.96 --> 3833.06]  Amen.
[3833.34 --> 3833.82]  Amen.
[3841.24 --> 3848.74]  So we serve and worship a God of mercy,
[3849.62 --> 3852.36]  and a God of provision,
[3852.56 --> 3854.06]  who has given us so many things.
[3854.06 --> 3860.24]  and so even as we take time now to continue to worship God with the giving of our offerings
[3860.24 --> 3867.04]  let's also even as we give let's remember this morning the ways that God has blessed us so
[3867.04 --> 3875.86]  richly individually and as a congregation so that we might give thanks to him may I now invite our
[3875.86 --> 3880.70]  deacons to collect our offering our offering designated offering for this morning is world
[3880.70 --> 3887.64]  renew and especially this is refugee Sunday and so the our giving goes to this cause
[3910.70 --> 3917.64]  so
[3917.64 --> 3924.58]  so
[3924.58 --> 3931.52]  so
[3931.52 --> 3938.46]  so
[3938.46 --> 3945.40]  so
[3945.40 --> 3952.34]  so
[3952.34 --> 3959.28]  so
[3959.28 --> 3966.22]  so
[3966.22 --> 3973.16]  so
[3973.16 --> 3980.10]  so
[3980.10 --> 3987.04]  so
[3987.04 --> 3993.98]  so
[3993.98 --> 4000.92]  so
[4000.92 --> 4002.92]  so
[4002.92 --> 4009.86]  so
[4009.86 --> 4016.80]  so
[4016.80 --> 4017.80]  so
[4017.80 --> 4029.80]  so
[4029.80 --> 4029.88]  so
[4029.88 --> 4033.86]  we'll now go to the Lord in prayer for the needs of our world our congregation
[4033.86 --> 4039.28]  and at the end we will say the Lord's Prayer together the words will be on the screen and
[4039.28 --> 4045.24]  I made a switch recently I think for a while we were using trespasses and I kind of switched
[4045.24 --> 4052.58]  it to debts so I think I threw you off last time but we'll use debts this time so let's
[4052.58 --> 4053.08]  pray together
[4053.08 --> 4054.08]  pray together
[4054.08 --> 4056.08]  so let's pray together
[4056.08 --> 4056.96]  great God
[4056.96 --> 4056.98]  great God
[4056.98 --> 4059.36]  heavenly Father
[4059.36 --> 4061.60]  creator of the universe
[4061.60 --> 4066.58]  we delight Lord at the privilege that we can call you our Father
[4066.58 --> 4072.72]  Lord we need to be constantly reminded of how amazing that is
[4072.72 --> 4078.32]  and Lord we rejoice in the work of Christ Jesus your only begotten Son
[4078.32 --> 4082.34]  who earned that privilege for us
[4082.34 --> 4090.04]  and so Lord we come to you this morning as your beloved sons and daughters and we come with boldness
[4090.04 --> 4092.30]  addressing our Father who loves us
[4092.30 --> 4097.56]  and Lord we come this morning into this place with many cares and concerns
[4097.56 --> 4101.76]  including Lord the the news that we've seen
[4101.76 --> 4107.70]  especially last week or in recent days Lord of further war in the world
[4108.32 --> 4115.56]  and Lord our first reaction when we hear that read the news about war is grief
[4115.56 --> 4119.32]  Lord we grieve the reality of conflict and death
[4119.32 --> 4123.22]  Father we weep this morning with all those who are weeping
[4123.22 --> 4125.56]  whether in Iran
[4125.56 --> 4127.82]  in Israel and Gaza
[4127.82 --> 4128.76]  in the Congo
[4128.76 --> 4130.06]  in Ukraine
[4130.06 --> 4132.42]  and Lord in so many places
[4132.42 --> 4134.94]  we pray Lord for all those who
[4134.94 --> 4139.64]  who wake up this morning or who will go to bed this night in great fear
[4139.64 --> 4144.44]  Lord we pray for the presence and the witness of your church
[4144.44 --> 4146.12]  especially in those places
[4146.12 --> 4148.78]  Father would your people bear witness
[4148.78 --> 4150.90]  by your word and by your spirit
[4150.90 --> 4154.58]  to the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4154.58 --> 4158.40]  Lord we pray for all those who are working for peace
[4158.40 --> 4160.82]  especially Lord those in government offices
[4160.82 --> 4163.52]  would you give them wisdom and success
[4163.52 --> 4165.96]  as they pursue peace
[4165.96 --> 4167.18]  and we pray Lord that they would
[4167.18 --> 4172.16]  and it is our prayer that you would bring an end to all wars and all conflicts
[4172.16 --> 4175.22]  and that we would experience even now
[4175.22 --> 4179.82]  a foretaste of your heavenly kingdom for which we long
[4179.82 --> 4182.48]  come quickly Lord Jesus
[4182.48 --> 4185.16]  and Lord we also pray
[4185.16 --> 4187.70]  this being Refugee Sunday
[4187.70 --> 4191.36]  Lord for the refugee crisis that continues unabated around the world
[4191.36 --> 4195.44]  and exasperated by wars and conflicts
[4195.44 --> 4201.54]  Lord we pray that refugees would find places of safety
[4201.54 --> 4207.68]  especially Lord that nations who have known Christianity
[4207.68 --> 4209.90]  and who have been shaped by the ways of Christ
[4209.90 --> 4212.08]  would they continue in the ministry of the church
[4212.08 --> 4214.26]  the ministry of the church throughout the ages
[4214.26 --> 4215.30]  to show welcome
[4215.30 --> 4218.50]  the welcome of Jesus to the needy
[4218.50 --> 4221.98]  thank you Lord for the ways that we as a church here
[4221.98 --> 4224.22]  have by your grace been able to participate
[4224.22 --> 4227.38]  in this work over the years
[4227.38 --> 4230.24]  Lord for the great and many blessings
[4230.24 --> 4234.64]  that these families have been to us
[4234.64 --> 4236.40]  as they become part of our congregation
[4236.40 --> 4239.64]  and Lord we cannot make all things right
[4239.64 --> 4243.14]  so we confess Lord that you can
[4243.14 --> 4247.04]  and until you do Lord would you fill us with a sure hope
[4247.04 --> 4250.24]  not only of our salvation through Christ
[4250.24 --> 4252.68]  but that Christ is making all things new
[4252.68 --> 4257.18]  Father we do also pray for the cares and concerns
[4257.18 --> 4258.42]  not only of this world
[4258.42 --> 4259.94]  but also Lord
[4259.94 --> 4262.88]  for our local congregation
[4262.88 --> 4263.94]  we pray this morning
[4263.94 --> 4267.68]  for especially our summer camp coming up
[4267.68 --> 4268.98]  in just a couple weeks
[4268.98 --> 4270.78]  Lord we pray that
[4270.78 --> 4273.00]  Jesus would be faithfully proclaimed
[4273.00 --> 4274.20]  in word and in deed
[4274.20 --> 4277.62]  to all those who come
[4277.62 --> 4278.38]  all the children
[4278.38 --> 4280.26]  give us help Lord
[4280.26 --> 4282.06]  myself and our volunteers
[4282.06 --> 4284.62]  as we make plans and preparations
[4284.62 --> 4285.76]  Lord we need your help
[4285.76 --> 4289.16]  we pray for each child who you will send here
[4289.16 --> 4293.18]  I think up to 45 kids so far registered
[4293.18 --> 4294.84]  Lord would you make
[4294.84 --> 4296.82]  your spirit
[4296.82 --> 4298.60]  would your spirit be mightily at work
[4298.60 --> 4300.24]  Lord in the hearts of these children
[4300.24 --> 4301.88]  and use this ministry Lord
[4301.88 --> 4303.40]  to draw them to yourself
[4303.40 --> 4304.32]  so that they
[4304.32 --> 4306.92]  could have the privilege of knowing you
[4306.92 --> 4309.04]  Father here in this congregation
[4309.04 --> 4311.12]  we lift up to you
[4311.12 --> 4313.56]  those who especially need your care
[4313.56 --> 4314.66]  Lord we think especially
[4314.66 --> 4316.00]  of George
[4316.00 --> 4318.04]  who is still struggling
[4318.04 --> 4319.04]  after his
[4319.04 --> 4321.00]  his operation
[4321.00 --> 4323.26]  Lord we think of also Henny
[4323.26 --> 4324.88]  who is even though home
[4324.88 --> 4325.60]  Lord needs
[4325.60 --> 4327.38]  needs healing and recuperation
[4327.38 --> 4328.96]  we think of Art
[4328.96 --> 4329.78]  who is in
[4329.78 --> 4331.48]  hospice Lord
[4331.48 --> 4332.22]  with cancer
[4332.22 --> 4334.32]  Lord would your
[4334.32 --> 4335.16]  hand
[4335.16 --> 4336.54]  especially be upon
[4336.54 --> 4337.64]  these brothers and sisters
[4337.64 --> 4339.86]  but Lord we also pray
[4339.86 --> 4340.74]  and lift up to you
[4340.74 --> 4342.16]  all those who are weary this day
[4342.16 --> 4344.68]  all those who are weeping this day
[4344.68 --> 4346.96]  all those who are burdened
[4346.96 --> 4348.22]  with cares and concerns
[4348.22 --> 4349.78]  God would you give us rest
[4349.78 --> 4352.54]  and Lord we seek rest
[4352.54 --> 4353.66]  in so many things
[4353.66 --> 4356.86]  but Lord would we find
[4356.86 --> 4358.04]  our true rest in you
[4358.04 --> 4360.04]  and Lord would you give us healing
[4360.04 --> 4361.80]  would you give us comfort
[4361.80 --> 4364.28]  and Lord would you cause us
[4364.28 --> 4365.64]  to fix our eyes
[4365.64 --> 4366.88]  and our hopes firmly
[4366.88 --> 4368.24]  on our Lord Jesus Christ
[4368.24 --> 4370.16]  we ask all these things
[4370.16 --> 4371.22]  in his name
[4371.22 --> 4373.24]  and we now pray
[4373.24 --> 4374.26]  the way that he taught us
[4374.26 --> 4374.62]  to pray
[4374.62 --> 4375.26]  saying together
[4375.26 --> 4377.64]  our Father who art in heaven

[4389.34 --> 4391.36]  as we forgive our debtors
[4391.36 --> 4393.68]  and lead us not into temptation
[4393.68 --> 4395.68]  but deliver us from evil
[4395.68 --> 4397.42]  for thine is the kingdom
[4397.42 --> 4398.60]  and the power
[4398.60 --> 4400.10]  and the glory forever
