• A sermon series on John the Baptist and Luke 7:18-30
• Jesus is asked by John the Baptist if he is the Messiah
• Jesus responds with examples of his miracles and tells John's messengers to report back on what they've seen and heard
• Jesus explains that he has come to bring good news to the poor and to preach about himself
• Jesus talks about John the Baptist, saying he is a great prophet but greater than him is yet to come
• The Pharisees and experts in the law reject God's purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by John
• John the Baptist asks if Jesus is the Messiah, possibly due to his circumstances of being imprisoned
• The reason for John's doubt may be due to the circumstances of his imprisonment and questioning whether Jesus is truly the Messiah.
• The location of John the Baptist's imprisonment
• The possibility that John was imprisoned in a cave cell with chains
• John's doubts and questioning of whether Jesus is the Messiah
• Peter's experience of having expectations of Jesus as the Messiah
• The nature of John's question to his disciples to ask Jesus if he is the one who is to come
• Jesus' response to John's question (not discussed in detail)
• John asks Jesus if he is the one who has come to proclaim liberty and set captives free.
• The question is not about getting out of prison or resolving personal circumstances, but about identifying Jesus as the Messiah.
• John wants to know who Jesus is because it will determine how he views himself, his situation, and everything else.
• If Jesus is truly the one, then whatever difficulties or circumstances come are insignificant compared to what can be received through him.
• The lens of perspective matters: looking at life through the lens of oneself versus looking through the lens of who Jesus is.
• John's question "or should we expect someone else?" implies that if Jesus is not the one, people will always look for someone or something else to fill their needs and provide a sense of security.
• The quote from St. Augustine emphasizes the universal human search for rest, meaning, and identity in God.
• The speaker discusses trust in a higher power or security
• Comparison is made between trusting in wealth, education, career, or other external factors versus trusting in God/Jesus

• The significance of Jesus' answer in verse 22 and its implications for understanding faith are discussed
• Jesus' statement about not stumbling on account of him
• The concept of scandalization and its relationship to faith in Jesus
• The idea that some people will be offended or stumble due to Jesus' teachings and actions
• Possible reasons for offence, including Jesus' claims of divinity and pre-existence
• Two specific factors that caused people to stumble: Jesus being a friend to the broken and his emphasis on surrendering to him
• Jesus heals the blind, lame, leper, and deaf
• People were initially confused about Jesus' method of healing and service
• In Jesus' time, people saw physical problems as mainly social and spiritual issues
• The Messiah's role was to help marginalized and broken people
• Jesus came as a servant, not in power or with an army
• He befriended sinners and marginalized individuals
• The crowd questioned Jesus about John the Baptist and what they had gone out to see
• Comparison of Jesus' and John's preaching styles
• John's humble appearance and message of repentance
• Jesus as the prophet who prepares the way for the Messiah
• The offence caused by John's message of spiritual sickness and need for healing
• The reaction of tax collectors and Pharisees to John's baptism
• Jesus' baptism and message of repentance were rejected by some people
• Those who rejected John's baptism also rejected his message of repentance and their own sinfulness
• People in Jesus' day did not reject him due to a lack of evidence, as the miracles he performed were undeniable
• However, people still rejected Jesus because of the offence caused by acknowledging their sinfulness and need for forgiveness
• Only an openness to the offence of Jesus can receive the kind of grace he offers
• Jesus is a friend to those who are broken and sinners
• He has not left us to ourselves despite our many sins
• His grace is overflowing and abundant
• We can never outrun the living water and grace he offers
• Help us to believe in his love and live in it
