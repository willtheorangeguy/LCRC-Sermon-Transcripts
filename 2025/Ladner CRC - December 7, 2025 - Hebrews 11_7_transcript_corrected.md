[0.00 → 26.22] Land of the E padres
[26.22 → 27.22] Amen.
[56.22 → 57.22] Amen.
[86.22 → 87.22] Amen.
[116.22 → 117.22] Amen.
[146.22 → 147.22] Amen.
[176.22 → 177.22] Amen.
[206.22 → 207.22] Amen.
[236.22 → 237.22] Amen.
[237.22 → 238.22] Amen.
[266.22 → 268.22] Amen.
[296.22 → 303.00] A king who would come through the darkness
[303.00 → 309.02] And walk where I walk full of greatness
[309.02 → 313.22] And call me to his side
[313.22 → 318.06] Just like a father and child
[326.22 → 337.42] Well, good morning, everyone.
[338.30 → 343.46] Welcome to worship on this Lord's Day at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[344.72 → 347.00] We are here this morning to worship God.
[347.48 → 352.00] And we are here to celebrate the resurrected Christ.
[352.00 → 356.00] If you are a guest or a visitor here with us today,
[356.00 → 357.64] we are so glad that you are here.
[357.94 → 359.72] Welcome to you.
[360.14 → 365.22] And there is a welcome card that you'll find maybe in front of you somewhere,
[365.52 → 366.72] in the pew in front of you.
[367.12 → 369.84] And if you would like to make yourself known,
[370.34 → 371.46] please do fill that out.
[371.54 → 375.40] And you can drop it in the offering bag later in the service as that is passed around.
[375.56 → 379.44] We would love to welcome you and get you connected with our church.
[380.32 → 383.90] As far as some announcements, you'll find those in your bulletin.
[383.90 → 386.60] And we are in the season of Advent.
[386.88 → 391.58] And each Sunday we have some people lead in our candle lighting and Advent liturgy.
[391.78 → 395.38] And we have one slot available on December 21st.
[395.38 → 399.04] So if you are interested as a family, as a few friends together,
[399.48 → 404.16] please do let me know, or you can write your name on the sign-up sheet on the table.
[404.16 → 410.84] Also, our Christmas Eve service and Christmas Day services are coming up.
[411.34 → 413.16] So we do have a Christmas Eve service.
[413.30 → 417.38] It's at 6.30 p.m. on December 24th, of course.
[417.86 → 422.18] And then in the morning, we gather again on Christmas Day at 10 o'clock
[422.18 → 426.32] for a shorter service of, again, just singing Christmas hymns
[426.32 → 429.24] and hearing a message about, of course, Christmas
[429.24 → 433.12] and gathering together to worship the Lord on that day.
[433.82 → 434.90] And then one more announcement.
[435.04 → 436.56] I'll invite John Bester to come up.
[443.10 → 443.66] Good morning.
[443.66 → 444.66] Good morning.
[444.66 → 445.66] Good morning.
[445.66 → 449.04] You may have noticed the large Christmas tree in the foyer full
[449.04 → 451.04] of paper ornaments that look like this.
[451.04 → 456.48] And they've got something from World Renew, different things we can gift.
[457.14 → 460.38] This is our World Renew Canada giving tree.
[460.90 → 464.62] And each ornament represents a gift from the World Renew gift catalogue,
[464.98 → 469.16] which looks like this, which you, if you got a banner in October,
[469.16 → 470.66] it would be, had been inside.
[471.12 → 473.20] And there are a few copies in the foyer still.
[473.66 → 479.04] Please consider taking an ornament off the tree and gifting a goat or a pig
[479.04 → 485.58] or chickens or nutrition kits or literacy materials, among many other items listed
[485.58 → 487.24] on the ornaments or in the catalogue.
[488.66 → 494.28] When I was in Guatemala last spring, I witnessed firsthand what a difference these gifts make
[494.28 → 495.74] to lifting people out of poverty.
[496.22 → 501.26] We visited a village that had received beehives and chickens from World Renew.
[501.26 → 507.64] And beekeeping provided many in the village with a stable income from selling the honey.
[507.64 → 513.64] And bees increased crop production by pollinating plants within five kilometres of the hive.
[514.84 → 520.38] Raising chickens became a community endeavour with the start of donated chickens.
[520.38 → 526.38] This year we hope everyone will take an ornament or two of their choosing.
[526.92 → 531.00] Instructions for payment are on the back side of the ornament.
[531.70 → 533.56] And the payments go to World Renew.
[534.76 → 539.10] Maybe someone on your Christmas list, you have someone on your Christmas list
[539.10 → 540.20] and you don't know what to give.
[540.20 → 546.02] Well, maybe consider giving a farm animal or tools in their name.
[546.54 → 549.84] And you don't have to worry about the welfare of the animals
[549.84 → 552.44] because they're not being shipped from North America.
[553.32 → 559.88] They're, as World Renew operates around the world, they support local economies.
[559.88 → 563.52] So all these gifts, most of them will come from local sources.
[563.52 → 565.82] Thank you for your consideration.
[578.12 → 583.36] And as was mentioned, this is the second Sunday in the church season of Advent.
[583.54 → 585.80] And we have our candle lighting liturgy.
[586.10 → 589.64] And I'm going to invite Kenny and Lorna and their boys.
[589.72 → 590.12] Are they coming?
[590.58 → 591.12] No.
[591.54 → 592.10] No.
[592.10 → 592.16] No.
[592.16 → 594.88] They already got to run around earlier.
[595.48 → 597.88] But there will be some responsive liturgy.
[598.08 → 602.34] So where it's indicated, as you're all used to, please do say the words along.
[602.42 → 603.26] That will be on the screen.
[603.26 → 605.96] And we conclude with a prayer that we'll say together.
[613.96 → 617.90] By faith, Noah, when warned about things not yet seen,
[618.08 → 620.96] in holy fear, built an ark to save his family.
[622.16 → 633.76] Advent points us to God's peace.
[633.76 → 638.88] We seek the peace that comes from trusting God's promise and protection.
[638.88 → 639.00] Amen.
[640.10 → 644.34] Like Noah, we rest in the refuge of God's promise.
[653.98 → 657.68] We light this candle remembering that Christ is our peace,
[658.24 → 661.04] calling us out of fear and into faithful obedience.
[661.04 → 662.04] Amen.
[662.04 → 668.00] Come, Lord Jesus, bring your peace to our hearts and to your world.
[669.34 → 670.92] God of Noah,
[671.30 → 674.56] wipe our fears and steady our hearts.
[675.10 → 678.26] Lead us into the peace that comes from you.
[678.26 → 679.26] Amen.
[679.26 → 680.02] Amen.
[680.02 → 680.12] Amen.
[680.12 → 680.16] Amen.
[680.16 → 680.22] Amen.
[680.22 → 680.26] Amen.
[680.26 → 682.16] Amen.
[682.16 → 682.26] Amen.
[682.26 → 683.26] Amen.
[683.26 → 684.26] Amen.
[684.26 → 684.30] Amen.
[684.30 → 685.22] Amen.
[685.22 → 686.22] Amen.
[686.22 → 686.26] Amen.
[686.26 → 687.22] Amen.
[687.22 → 688.22] Amen.
[688.22 → 688.26] Amen.
[688.26 → 689.22] Amen.
[689.22 → 690.22] Amen.
[690.22 → 691.94] Amen.
[691.94 → 696.08] So please stand with me as we receive God's greeting to us this morning.
[698.56 → 702.74] Our greeting comes from Psalm 124, verse 8.
[703.54 → 708.70] Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[709.20 → 713.12] As God has called us and greeted us, let's turn and let's welcome and let's greet one another
[713.12 → 714.50] us and turn now, so we'll be a thank you for joining us.
[714.54 → 728.30] I do not want to raise the knowledge of the community of heaven and earth, just like the
[728.30 → 728.40] family of heaven and earth and knowing the kingdom of heaven.
[728.40 → 729.64] Okay to you again, nice to see the youth in heaven and earth, and you do not like Selden,
[729.64 → 759.62] Thank you.
[759.64 → 789.62] Thank you.
[789.64 → 800.10] Come in hopeful expectation, all the earth in silence waits.
[800.10 → 810.56] For the light to pierce the darkness coming down from heaven's gate.
[810.56 → 820.56] To our people steeped in sorrow, to our world consumed by pain.
[820.56 → 831.56] Waiting for the long-held promise of a joy that will remain.
[831.56 → 843.80] Who was low in expectation, looking for your promised King.
[844.02 → 853.56] Who brings freedom from oppression and a new day to begin.
[853.56 → 863.56] From awaited, this Messiah overcomes the deepest gloom.
[865.02 → 875.02] For those eagerly awaiting, ready to prepare Him room.
[875.02 → 888.28] As our voices rise in worship, we will open wide our hearts.
[888.28 → 898.58] To receive our humble Saviour, nevermore to dwell apart.
[898.74 → 903.28] Peace and joy will rise within us.
[904.24 → 908.50] Hope and love will fill the earth.
[908.50 → 919.96] For the greatest gift is given at our dear Messiah's birth.
[919.96 → 941.56] Christ's glory fills the skies.
[941.56 → 946.82] Christ's the everlasting light.
[947.02 → 951.94] Son of righteousness arise.
[951.94 → 957.72] And triumph for these chains of mine
[957.72 → 965.04] Come thou long-awaited one
[965.04 → 970.10] In the fullness of your love
[970.10 → 975.20] And lose this heart bound up by shame
[975.20 → 980.54] And I will never be the same
[980.54 → 985.72] So here I wait in hope of you
[985.72 → 991.10] All my soul's longing through and through
[991.10 → 996.40] And days spring from on I be near
[996.40 → 1001.72] And days start in my heart appear
[1001.72 → 1009.72] Dark and chill, this is the morn
[1009.72 → 1014.90] Until your love in me is born
[1014.90 → 1019.98] And joyless is the evening song
[1019.98 → 1024.72] Until Emmanuel has come
[1024.72 → 1029.90] So here I wait in hope of you
[1029.90 → 1035.08] All my soul's longing through and through
[1035.08 → 1041.08] And days spring from on I be near
[1041.08 → 1046.08] And days start in my heart appear
[1046.08 → 1050.90] So here I wait in hope of you
[1050.90 → 1056.08] All my soul's longing through and through
[1056.08 → 1062.00] And days spring from on I be near
[1062.00 → 1067.08] And days start in my heart appear
[1067.08 → 1076.50] May you be seated
[1076.50 → 1092.52] Our first scripture reading this morning comes from Genesis chapter 6.
[1098.62 → 1101.74] The page number is printed in your order of worship.
[1102.24 → 1105.24] I don't have that in front of me, but it's Genesis chapter 6.
[1106.50 → 1110.16] And we're talking about Noah today.
[1110.68 → 1116.20] So in Hebrews 11, we'll read about Noah as an example of faith to us.
[1116.40 → 1122.72] And I thought, well, let's read the backstory a bit, which is found in Genesis chapter 6 and 7 and 8.
[1122.82 → 1124.68] We'll just read a few verses from chapter 6.
[1125.36 → 1126.84] Beginning in verse 9.
[1128.52 → 1131.54] This is the account of Noah.
[1131.54 → 1136.98] Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time.
[1137.50 → 1138.84] And he walked with God.
[1139.66 → 1143.24] Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[1143.92 → 1148.26] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.
[1148.92 → 1154.14] God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
[1154.14 → 1161.38] So God said to Noah, I'm going to put an end to all the people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.
[1161.92 → 1165.66] I am surely going to destroy both of them and the earth.
[1166.14 → 1172.60] So make yourself an ark of cypress wood and make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
[1172.60 → 1175.40] This is how long you are to build it.
[1175.86 → 1181.16] The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
[1181.60 → 1186.86] Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the roof of the top.
[1187.44 → 1191.42] Put a door in the side of the ark and make a lower, middle, and upper decks.
[1192.16 → 1196.74] I'm going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens.
[1197.22 → 1202.04] Every creature that has the breath of life in it, everything on earth will perish.
[1202.04 → 1210.24] But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
[1211.00 → 1217.24] You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
[1217.76 → 1225.76] Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal, and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
[1225.76 → 1232.48] You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.
[1233.64 → 1237.50] Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
[1238.52 → 1239.86] This is the word of the Lord.
[1239.86 → 1241.58] Thank you, Lord.
[1244.46 → 1249.82] So as we come now to this time of confession, as we confess our sins together this morning,
[1249.98 → 1259.76] we're reminded that God is primarily concerned not with our outward appearance, but with our hearts.
[1259.76 → 1270.40] He's concerned with the condition of our hearts, whether we come to him in humility, in true sorrow for our sins,
[1270.40 → 1278.64] in asking for his forgiveness for our sins, and in putting our hope in Jesus Christ and what he has done for us.
[1279.50 → 1284.22] And so let's pray this morning a confession together in unison first,
[1284.22 → 1288.86] and then following that we'll have a time for private confession.
[1289.26 → 1292.22] So let's pray this prayer in unison together.
[1293.90 → 1303.38] Almighty God, we believe that your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, is coming again in power to judge the earth.
[1303.38 → 1309.68] We confess that we have not lived as those who daily expect your kingdom.
[1309.68 → 1319.08] We have ignored your promised judgment by not loving you with our whole hearts or our neighbours as ourselves.
[1319.68 → 1324.26] Have mercy upon us and forgive us for all our offences.
[1325.16 → 1330.22] In your tender kindness, embrace us with your fatherly love
[1330.22 → 1337.88] and fill our hearts with the joyful expectation of seeing Jesus soon, face to face.
[1337.88 → 1341.88] We offer our prayers through him. Amen.
[1342.44 → 1350.18] So again, take a time now of bringing your own hearts before the Lord in a time of confession and turning to Christ.
[1367.88 → 1388.20] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you again this morning for the grace that calls and beckons us to come before you.
[1388.62 → 1394.90] And Lord, we come in humility, acknowledging our corrupt ways, our evil ways.
[1394.90 → 1399.60] And Lord, we simply look to the cross.
[1400.14 → 1401.36] To the cross we cling.
[1401.86 → 1408.24] We thank you, Lord, that at the cross we see the pardon that was accomplished for us,
[1408.56 → 1410.40] that we might be reconciled to God.
[1411.06 → 1416.40] And so, Lord, help us to live righteous lives as we go forth from here.
[1416.40 → 1419.36] And Lord, in the time that we have in this time of worship,
[1420.06 → 1425.20] Lord, we celebrate the victory of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[1425.20 → 1430.84] and the renewal of all things that you promised to accomplish at your return.
[1431.04 → 1432.56] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1433.50 → 1439.50] Brothers and sisters, let's stand and receive these words of assurance from the God who loves you
[1439.50 → 1442.22] and who has made provision for your forgiveness.
[1442.22 → 1445.56] 1 John 3, verse 5 says,
[1446.14 → 1450.66] But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins,
[1450.92 → 1453.92] and in him is no sin.
[1454.86 → 1458.62] So, friends, if you have repented and believe in God's redeeming mercy,
[1459.22 → 1461.30] your sins are forgiven.
[1461.78 → 1466.64] So trust in God's promise and begin anew your life with God.
[1467.30 → 1470.80] And so let's sing together of his mercy.
[1472.22 → 1474.90] Mi Lord,
[1474.90 → 1477.32] My name is Lord,
[1477.48 → 1479.96] My name is Lord,
[1479.96 → 1482.24] and I thank you to him for a long time.
[1482.24 → 1483.90] My name is Lord,
[1483.90 → 1486.36] and I thank you to and praise for Him for the command he asks on court,
[1486.36 → 1488.44] and I thank you to all of His mercy.
[1489.00 → 1490.36] Let Him pray for Him,
[1490.36 → 1490.96] because you know that he might not be true to you as a follower.
[1490.96 → 1491.24] Thank you foramen Kings,
[1491.24 → 1493.46] where heaven comes in the victory to all you know that he is experienced in prayer.
[1493.52 → 1496.72] With me not because you know that you know that and Jesus are given
[1496.72 → 1498.82] today,
[1498.82 → 1505.38] We long for your appearing.
[1507.38 → 1515.06] Take our despair, refresh our sight with ancient pride.
[1515.06 → 1519.00] Light hope within our hearts.
[1519.32 → 1526.06] Light hope within our hearts.
[1526.06 → 1532.06] We long for your appearing.
[1534.14 → 1541.32] Lord, comfort us, warm our souls, make us whole.
[1541.78 → 1545.40] Light peace within our hearts.
[1545.66 → 1552.06] Light peace within our hearts.
[1552.06 → 1559.06] We long for your appearing.
[1560.88 → 1564.06] Dissolve our gloom, dispel our night.
[1565.06 → 1567.06] Our souls ignite.
[1568.64 → 1571.06] Light joy within our hearts.
[1572.14 → 1578.06] Light joy within our hearts.
[1578.06 → 1585.06] We long for your appearing.
[1587.06 → 1591.52] Destroy our hate, renew our will.
[1591.70 → 1594.06] Your spirits fill.
[1595.06 → 1598.06] Light love within our hearts.
[1598.06 → 1605.06] Light love within our hearts.
[1605.06 → 1606.66] Light love and vogue of us.
[1615.94 → 1626.08] Light love within our hearts.
[1626.08 → 1633.54] I didn't even have to dismiss the kids.
[1633.64 → 1634.48] They go on their own.
[1634.90 → 1635.84] Like, get us out of here.
[1642.56 → 1645.48] Of course, we're excited that they're excited to go to Sunday school.
[1647.00 → 1648.70] So good morning to you again.
[1649.20 → 1650.88] We are in the season of Advent,
[1650.88 → 1652.78] which is the season when the church,
[1652.78 → 1656.16] across the centuries and around the world,
[1656.70 → 1658.20] thinks about waiting,
[1659.10 → 1660.10] thinks about hoping.
[1660.94 → 1666.44] As the Jews awaited Christ to come the first time over many long years,
[1666.90 → 1671.50] so the church today awaits his coming again a second time.
[1672.24 → 1674.44] As the Apostles' Creed says,
[1674.44 → 1678.18] he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God,
[1678.18 → 1685.74] and from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[1686.72 → 1688.82] And that idea, though, of judgment,
[1689.76 → 1692.18] of God judging all the peoples of the earth,
[1692.46 → 1696.84] does not necessarily sit well in our culture.
[1698.02 → 1700.18] But this is what we hope for.
[1700.18 → 1704.36] It's not all that his coming means,
[1704.50 → 1705.54] but it is part of it.
[1706.36 → 1710.40] Because though there is so much beauty and goodness in this world,
[1711.22 → 1713.86] we look around us and the days are evil.
[1714.92 → 1716.74] And councils are darkened.
[1717.78 → 1719.28] And there is violence in the world,
[1719.38 → 1720.72] and illness, and disasters,
[1721.56 → 1723.28] and deceitfulness, and greed.
[1723.88 → 1726.04] There is war and rumours of war.
[1726.04 → 1730.90] And so our hope is that Jesus is coming back to judge all things.
[1731.34 → 1735.04] Evil and sorrow and death will be no more
[1735.04 → 1738.30] because those things will not survive the judgment.
[1740.16 → 1744.32] And now, to help us learn what it means to wait,
[1744.60 → 1745.70] to await Christ,
[1746.00 → 1747.98] we are looking in this season of Advent
[1747.98 → 1749.36] to Hebrews chapter 11.
[1749.50 → 1751.70] It's known as the Hall of Faith.
[1751.70 → 1754.34] And it explores the lives of all these,
[1754.68 → 1757.04] in a sense, heroes of faith.
[1757.12 → 1758.12] They're not perfect people,
[1758.48 → 1760.26] but each one of them, by God's grace,
[1760.66 → 1761.66] had faith in God,
[1761.90 → 1763.14] had faith in God's promises.
[1764.30 → 1766.40] And they are approved for their faith,
[1766.46 → 1769.06] and they are commended for how they waited,
[1769.60 → 1770.64] how they waited in hope.
[1771.30 → 1773.08] So last week, we looked at Enoch,
[1773.54 → 1777.68] and we saw how Enoch walked with God.
[1777.68 → 1781.50] And he actually walked with God so closely
[1781.50 → 1784.56] that he walked with God from this world
[1784.56 → 1786.46] right into God's presence,
[1786.58 → 1787.74] for where God took him.
[1788.88 → 1791.94] And today, we move from Enoch to Noah.
[1792.66 → 1795.38] So, it's only one verse we have today,
[1795.58 → 1799.14] but if you'd like, you can turn there with me
[1799.14 → 1804.14] to Hebrews chapter 11, verse 7.
[1805.20 → 1805.76] That's our verse.
[1805.86 → 1806.36] Actually, you know what?
[1806.36 → 1808.06] Let's read, I think we have it on there.
[1808.22 → 1809.22] Let's read verse 1.
[1809.96 → 1810.82] Is verse 1 there?
[1811.58 → 1811.80] Yeah.
[1813.36 → 1813.94] It is.
[1814.14 → 1814.26] Okay.
[1815.02 → 1815.38] Yes.
[1815.62 → 1816.64] Okay, I'm going to read verse 1,
[1816.70 → 1817.88] and then I'm going to jump down to verse 7.
[1818.72 → 1818.96] Okay.
[1819.70 → 1823.32] Now, faith is being sure of what we hope for,
[1823.92 → 1826.08] and certain of what we do not see.
[1827.08 → 1829.70] This is what the ancients were commended for.
[1830.34 → 1831.26] Then verse 7.
[1831.26 → 1835.90] By faith, Noah, when warned about things not yet seen,
[1836.42 → 1838.90] in holy fear, built an ark to save his family.
[1839.78 → 1841.98] By his faith, he condemned the world
[1841.98 → 1846.02] and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
[1846.02 → 1848.04] This is the word of the Lord.
[1850.24 → 1852.94] So let's now pray, and let's ask the Holy Spirit.
[1853.20 → 1856.92] Let's ask God for his help as we open his word together.
[1857.02 → 1857.36] Let's pray.
[1858.54 → 1861.34] Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning for your word.
[1862.04 → 1863.36] And we thank you, Lord, for Noah,
[1864.04 → 1865.46] for his faithfulness to you.
[1865.46 → 1870.00] And we come to you acknowledging that you are the one who saves.
[1870.60 → 1872.18] You are the one who gives righteousness.
[1873.06 → 1874.62] And so we look to you, Lord,
[1874.70 → 1878.82] and we ask now that you would form and shape us by your word.
[1879.10 → 1882.98] Make us people who await your return with faith
[1882.98 → 1884.60] and with hope and with love.
[1885.78 → 1887.68] And to do so, Lord, for the good of our neighbours
[1887.68 → 1889.74] and for your glory alone.
[1890.04 → 1891.28] And we pray in Jesus' name.
[1891.60 → 1891.84] Amen.
[1891.84 → 1891.96] Amen.
[1893.52 → 1896.38] So back in 2011,
[1897.44 → 1899.38] the whole Northeast,
[1900.00 → 1901.28] the East Coast, the Northeast,
[1901.44 → 1903.02] and the town where I grew up,
[1903.48 → 1905.64] experienced one of the biggest natural disasters
[1905.64 → 1906.72] in living memory,
[1907.74 → 1909.38] Tropical Storm Irene.
[1910.20 → 1913.42] And the flooding that that storm brought,
[1914.16 → 1916.74] the floods took out bridges,
[1917.48 → 1919.12] took out roads,
[1919.48 → 1920.26] took out buildings.
[1920.26 → 1924.98] It was incredible how high those rivers got.
[1925.78 → 1927.00] Where on, you know,
[1927.04 → 1927.70] a summer day,
[1927.80 → 1929.40] there might be only a few inches of water,
[1929.50 → 1930.46] but during that storm,
[1931.20 → 1932.90] it had risen, you know,
[1933.26 → 1933.72] I don't know,
[1933.82 → 1934.92] 10 feet, 20 feet,
[1934.98 → 1937.80] so high that it actually would knock over bridges.
[1938.80 → 1940.14] Now, there's a church
[1940.14 → 1943.22] that I also happen to know about
[1943.22 → 1944.48] in New York State,
[1944.60 → 1945.72] close by also,
[1945.94 → 1947.24] who experienced the floods.
[1947.24 → 1949.12] And this is a church
[1949.12 → 1951.18] that a while previously
[1951.18 → 1954.04] had decided to fix up the basement
[1954.04 → 1955.96] and to make it into a youth room.
[1956.40 → 1957.74] What better use for a church basement
[1957.74 → 1958.38] than a youth room?
[1959.20 → 1961.10] And so they painted the walls,
[1961.24 → 1962.28] they scrubbed the floors,
[1962.48 → 1963.66] they put in new carpets,
[1964.14 → 1965.52] people in the church donated,
[1965.72 → 1966.92] TVs and couches,
[1967.70 → 1967.90] right?
[1968.02 → 1970.28] And it was a really nice youth room.
[1970.28 → 1973.74] Well, the church also had a brook
[1973.74 → 1976.92] that ran along near the church.
[1977.58 → 1979.60] And the local government officials said,
[1980.14 → 1980.24] you know,
[1980.30 → 1980.70] hey, you know,
[1981.00 → 1983.74] this brook has flooded before.
[1984.74 → 1986.78] And so sometimes the whole county
[1986.78 → 1989.52] would get a flood warning on occasion.
[1990.00 → 1991.50] And so the routine was
[1991.50 → 1992.80] the church would put out an email
[1992.80 → 1994.12] to all the parents.
[1994.54 → 1996.50] And so the parents and the kids would come
[1996.50 → 1998.04] and they'd move all the furniture
[1998.04 → 2000.30] from the basement upstairs.
[2001.20 → 2002.54] And then there would be no flood.
[2003.64 → 2004.62] And so the next day,
[2004.82 → 2006.02] the parents and the children
[2006.02 → 2006.68] would come back
[2006.68 → 2007.78] and they would move all the furniture
[2007.78 → 2009.06] back down into the basement.
[2009.62 → 2011.84] And this happened over and over.
[2012.58 → 2014.62] Well, Tropical Irene came
[2014.62 → 2017.26] and they received the warning
[2017.26 → 2018.98] and they thought,
[2019.16 → 2020.62] well, you know,
[2020.82 → 2022.64] this never amounts to anything.
[2022.64 → 2023.84] And it's all this work
[2023.84 → 2025.34] carrying furniture up and down the stairs.
[2025.34 → 2027.24] And so they didn't heed the warning.
[2028.28 → 2029.78] They thought it would be fine.
[2031.10 → 2033.30] And so the rains came down
[2033.30 → 2034.52] and the floods came up
[2034.52 → 2036.06] and the water level
[2036.06 → 2037.28] went right up to the ceiling.
[2038.52 → 2040.48] And everything in the youth room
[2040.48 → 2041.48] was just floating around.
[2041.80 → 2043.20] The TV, the couches,
[2043.48 → 2044.02] the refrigerator.
[2045.26 → 2049.62] And they didn't heed the warning, right?
[2049.70 → 2050.86] They had the warning,
[2050.98 → 2051.88] they had the forecast,
[2052.50 → 2054.34] but they didn't heed the warning.
[2054.34 → 2055.46] And as a result,
[2055.86 → 2056.64] there was flooding
[2056.64 → 2057.62] and there was damage.
[2058.96 → 2059.30] And now,
[2059.56 → 2060.98] the story of Noah
[2060.98 → 2063.80] has a lot more serious
[2063.80 → 2065.16] and grave consequences
[2065.16 → 2067.52] for those who did not heed the warning.
[2067.98 → 2069.56] Who did not heed the warning
[2069.56 → 2072.32] that God gave of a coming flood.
[2073.36 → 2076.36] And in contrast to everyone else,
[2076.52 → 2078.68] Noah did heed the warning.
[2078.86 → 2079.88] Noah believed God.
[2079.88 → 2082.68] And not only believed God,
[2082.80 → 2083.80] he prepared.
[2084.18 → 2085.96] He prepared by building an ark.
[2086.98 → 2087.96] And so as we consider
[2087.96 → 2089.92] the faithfulness of Noah this morning,
[2090.22 → 2092.74] here are our two questions
[2092.74 → 2093.92] about Noah.
[2094.78 → 2095.34] First,
[2095.90 → 2098.26] what is Noah commended for?
[2099.10 → 2099.84] And then secondly,
[2100.06 → 2101.58] how is Noah an example
[2101.58 → 2103.82] to us in our time of waiting?
[2104.46 → 2104.56] Okay.
[2104.56 → 2106.18] What is Noah commended for?
[2106.80 → 2108.20] And how is he an example
[2108.20 → 2109.36] for us today
[2109.36 → 2110.78] in our own time of waiting?
[2111.62 → 2112.28] So first,
[2112.36 → 2113.54] what was Noah commended for?
[2113.90 → 2116.48] How did Noah please God?
[2117.30 → 2117.62] Well,
[2117.66 → 2118.82] there are three things
[2118.82 → 2119.82] that are mentioned
[2119.82 → 2120.68] or implied
[2120.68 → 2121.56] in verse 7
[2121.56 → 2122.48] in our passage today.
[2123.00 → 2123.86] Those three things are
[2123.86 → 2125.34] that Noah believed God,
[2125.42 → 2126.72] that he obeyed God,
[2127.08 → 2128.48] and that he condemned the world.
[2129.10 → 2129.32] Okay.
[2129.32 → 2130.10] He believed God,
[2130.70 → 2131.58] he obeyed God,
[2131.70 → 2132.56] he condemned the world.
[2132.56 → 2133.18] So first,
[2133.64 → 2133.94] Noah,
[2134.26 → 2135.46] we are told,
[2135.66 → 2136.42] believed God.
[2137.00 → 2137.88] So our verse,
[2137.92 → 2138.74] and we'll just pretty much
[2138.74 → 2139.82] leave it up there,
[2140.66 → 2140.94] says,
[2141.04 → 2141.90] by faith Noah,
[2142.12 → 2143.48] when warned about things
[2143.48 → 2144.44] not yet seen,
[2145.20 → 2146.06] in holy fear,
[2146.16 → 2146.66] built an ark
[2146.66 → 2147.50] to save his family.
[2149.38 → 2150.92] And so we read earlier
[2150.92 → 2152.02] the story of Noah
[2152.02 → 2154.12] that's found in Genesis chapter 6.
[2154.86 → 2155.00] Right?
[2155.08 → 2156.06] God saw
[2156.06 → 2157.72] how wicked and corrupt
[2157.72 → 2158.88] the people on earth
[2158.88 → 2160.14] had become.
[2160.96 → 2162.12] And God tells
[2162.12 → 2164.00] his plan of judgment
[2164.00 → 2165.44] to one man,
[2166.00 → 2166.80] to the man Noah.
[2167.66 → 2168.90] The coming flood
[2168.90 → 2171.18] is not yet seen.
[2171.72 → 2172.90] It's not yet clear.
[2173.04 → 2174.40] It's not yet obvious.
[2175.06 → 2175.76] And yet,
[2175.96 → 2176.80] in faith,
[2177.28 → 2178.64] Noah believes God.
[2179.56 → 2179.80] Right?
[2179.86 → 2181.56] He took God
[2181.56 → 2182.70] at his word,
[2183.50 → 2184.74] that though he cannot see it,
[2184.76 → 2186.08] that there will come
[2186.08 → 2187.68] this great flood.
[2188.56 → 2188.92] And that,
[2189.00 → 2189.16] friends,
[2189.20 → 2189.94] that's fundamentally
[2189.94 → 2190.50] what it means
[2190.50 → 2191.46] to have faith in God.
[2191.46 → 2192.48] It means that
[2192.48 → 2193.52] instead of living
[2193.52 → 2194.26] by,
[2194.46 → 2195.10] according to,
[2195.40 → 2196.66] what you see
[2196.66 → 2198.56] and how maybe you feel,
[2199.38 → 2200.42] you let God,
[2200.52 → 2201.26] what he says,
[2201.38 → 2202.86] what he tells you,
[2203.10 → 2204.14] define reality.
[2204.86 → 2205.88] And you live
[2205.88 → 2206.38] according
[2206.38 → 2207.84] to what God says.
[2208.84 → 2209.56] And so God
[2209.56 → 2210.40] comes to Noah
[2210.40 → 2210.82] and says,
[2210.92 → 2211.10] Noah,
[2211.32 → 2212.70] there is a flood coming,
[2212.88 → 2213.70] it's a big one.
[2213.70 → 2216.46] and it will sweep away
[2216.46 → 2217.96] everything before it.
[2218.12 → 2218.98] Nothing will be able
[2218.98 → 2219.60] to stop it.
[2219.92 → 2221.08] Nothing will be able
[2221.08 → 2222.42] to stand before it.
[2222.90 → 2223.60] And I want you
[2223.60 → 2224.14] to get ready.
[2225.56 → 2226.08] And so Noah,
[2226.26 → 2227.08] on the basis
[2227.08 → 2228.26] of God's word alone,
[2228.96 → 2229.52] it says,
[2230.16 → 2230.92] he responded
[2230.92 → 2233.56] in holy fear.
[2234.58 → 2235.46] In holy fear.
[2235.46 → 2237.98] Thomas Manton
[2237.98 → 2239.22] is an old
[2239.22 → 2239.72] Puritan
[2239.72 → 2240.92] preacher,
[2241.12 → 2241.40] author,
[2241.76 → 2242.42] and he preached
[2242.42 → 2243.38] a sermon on this text
[2243.38 → 2244.54] and he says this,
[2244.64 → 2244.88] he says,
[2244.94 → 2245.00] well,
[2245.06 → 2245.78] there's a difference.
[2246.70 → 2247.82] The people of the world
[2247.82 → 2248.86] did not tremble
[2248.86 → 2249.40] with fear
[2249.40 → 2250.64] until the water
[2250.64 → 2251.76] reached the rooftops,
[2252.30 → 2253.84] but Noah trembled
[2253.84 → 2254.56] in fear
[2254.56 → 2255.40] when God
[2255.40 → 2256.86] did but speak.
[2256.86 → 2259.68] I love that.
[2260.72 → 2262.28] God did but speak
[2262.28 → 2262.88] and Noah
[2262.88 → 2265.00] responded in holy fear.
[2265.58 → 2266.40] And that word fear,
[2266.48 → 2266.90] what does it mean?
[2266.94 → 2267.62] It doesn't mean
[2267.62 → 2268.98] he was afraid,
[2269.14 → 2269.70] it doesn't mean
[2269.70 → 2270.72] he was terrified,
[2271.14 → 2272.34] but the word actually
[2272.34 → 2273.64] just means reverence,
[2273.80 → 2274.66] it means awe
[2274.66 → 2276.70] toward the God
[2276.70 → 2277.16] who spoke.
[2277.36 → 2277.82] God,
[2278.38 → 2278.84] the creator
[2278.84 → 2279.98] of heaven and earth,
[2281.54 → 2282.14] spoke
[2282.14 → 2283.66] in Noah
[2283.66 → 2284.78] in reverence
[2284.78 → 2285.34] of God
[2285.34 → 2286.16] and his word
[2286.16 → 2287.32] believed him
[2287.32 → 2287.96] and responded
[2287.96 → 2288.68] in faith.
[2289.76 → 2290.16] And so,
[2290.54 → 2291.96] this is the response
[2291.96 → 2292.44] of faith,
[2292.54 → 2293.04] we are told.
[2293.94 → 2294.42] And so,
[2294.54 → 2294.72] you know,
[2294.86 → 2295.90] the sun was shining,
[2296.34 → 2297.54] the birds were chirping,
[2297.68 → 2298.16] and the people
[2298.16 → 2299.04] were going about
[2299.04 → 2300.20] doing evil things
[2300.20 → 2301.28] and getting away
[2301.28 → 2301.68] with it.
[2302.62 → 2303.34] But Noah
[2303.34 → 2304.16] believes God
[2304.16 → 2305.04] when God tells him
[2305.04 → 2305.86] it won't last.
[2306.64 → 2307.94] All this you see,
[2308.30 → 2309.52] it won't last.
[2309.62 → 2310.22] He believes
[2310.22 → 2311.08] what God says
[2311.08 → 2312.32] in spite of what
[2312.32 → 2312.96] he sees
[2312.96 → 2314.12] and for this faith
[2314.12 → 2314.80] he was commended.
[2314.80 → 2316.18] Now,
[2316.26 → 2317.04] before you
[2317.04 → 2318.04] excuse yourself,
[2318.16 → 2319.38] before I excuse myself,
[2319.68 → 2320.10] and say,
[2320.22 → 2320.34] well,
[2320.40 → 2320.56] yeah,
[2320.68 → 2320.84] you know,
[2320.90 → 2322.08] if God came to me
[2322.08 → 2323.62] and told me something,
[2324.38 → 2325.56] of course I would believe it.
[2326.96 → 2328.08] Are you so sure?
[2329.84 → 2330.06] Right?
[2330.14 → 2331.44] Adam was warned by God,
[2331.98 → 2333.30] but Adam didn't believe.
[2334.58 → 2335.76] And I find that
[2335.76 → 2336.40] even when God
[2336.40 → 2337.54] tells me things
[2337.54 → 2338.52] in his word,
[2338.72 → 2339.74] I don't always
[2339.74 → 2340.98] respond in faith.
[2340.98 → 2343.10] I can know
[2343.10 → 2344.12] what God wants
[2344.12 → 2344.98] and still choose
[2344.98 → 2346.08] to do something else.
[2347.30 → 2348.16] And that's what
[2348.16 → 2349.98] Noah was commended for.
[2350.40 → 2351.08] When warned
[2351.08 → 2352.82] of things not seen,
[2353.58 → 2355.14] Noah believed God
[2355.14 → 2356.80] and responded in faith.
[2357.80 → 2357.94] Okay,
[2357.94 → 2358.74] so Noah believed God.
[2358.86 → 2358.90] Now,
[2359.06 → 2359.90] the second thing
[2359.90 → 2361.08] that Noah was commended for
[2361.08 → 2362.52] was his obedience.
[2363.34 → 2363.46] Okay,
[2363.52 → 2364.34] Noah believed
[2364.34 → 2365.42] what God said
[2365.42 → 2366.28] and that belief
[2366.28 → 2367.48] moved him
[2367.48 → 2368.42] to action.
[2368.42 → 2369.18] It moved him
[2369.18 → 2370.22] to obedience.
[2371.20 → 2371.70] And so notice
[2371.70 → 2372.26] what it says,
[2372.38 → 2373.26] by faith Noah,
[2373.48 → 2374.16] let's go back,
[2375.30 → 2376.28] by faith Noah
[2376.28 → 2377.04] when warned
[2377.04 → 2377.64] about things
[2377.64 → 2378.62] not yet seen
[2378.62 → 2379.80] in holy fear,
[2380.80 → 2381.44] built an ark.
[2382.30 → 2382.52] Right?
[2382.56 → 2383.36] He built an ark
[2383.36 → 2384.84] to save his family.
[2385.60 → 2385.84] Right?
[2385.90 → 2386.48] The warning
[2386.48 → 2387.38] was about things
[2387.38 → 2388.50] not yet seen,
[2388.80 → 2389.92] but you could see
[2389.92 → 2391.02] Noah's faith
[2391.02 → 2392.40] by what he did.
[2393.32 → 2395.02] Noah built an ark.
[2395.74 → 2396.22] And so while
[2396.22 → 2397.10] the birds were chirping,
[2397.24 → 2398.18] while the sun was shining,
[2398.34 → 2398.98] while the people
[2398.98 → 2399.68] of the world
[2399.68 → 2400.72] were frolicking
[2400.72 → 2401.64] and sinning
[2401.64 → 2402.46] against God
[2402.46 → 2403.62] and laughing about it,
[2404.74 → 2405.02] Noah,
[2405.28 → 2406.24] as it were,
[2406.50 → 2408.28] built an ark,
[2408.76 → 2409.80] a cargo ship,
[2410.28 → 2410.82] in the middle
[2410.82 → 2411.66] of Alberta.
[2413.10 → 2413.46] Okay?
[2414.60 → 2415.50] Just imagine
[2415.50 → 2416.54] what it was like
[2416.54 → 2417.10] for Noah
[2417.10 → 2418.82] to build his ark,
[2418.90 → 2420.86] this enormous barge,
[2421.66 → 2422.64] hundreds of miles
[2422.64 → 2423.62] from the nearest water,
[2424.04 → 2424.58] in a place
[2424.58 → 2425.16] where there was
[2425.16 → 2426.06] very little rainfall.
[2426.06 → 2427.06] of the earth.
[2428.80 → 2429.78] Genesis 6,
[2429.88 → 2430.36] 22,
[2430.50 → 2430.96] that we read,
[2431.06 → 2431.36] says,
[2431.46 → 2432.46] Noah did everything
[2432.46 → 2433.56] just as God
[2433.56 → 2434.18] commanded him.
[2435.50 → 2435.66] Right?
[2435.96 → 2436.70] Imagine him
[2436.70 → 2437.74] laying the keel
[2437.74 → 2439.58] for this ark
[2439.58 → 2441.62] in Genesis 6,
[2441.70 → 2442.14] told us,
[2442.34 → 2443.96] 450 feet long.
[2444.80 → 2445.44] If you're trying
[2445.44 → 2446.36] to visualize that,
[2446.60 → 2447.76] it is one and a half
[2447.76 → 2449.06] football fields long.
[2449.06 → 2451.74] And then imagine
[2451.74 → 2452.26] him putting
[2452.26 → 2453.60] the ribs up
[2453.60 → 2455.16] on this barge
[2455.16 → 2457.36] and just hammering away.
[2457.50 → 2457.94] We don't know
[2457.94 → 2458.84] how long it took.
[2459.40 → 2460.34] Some people say
[2460.34 → 2461.52] 75 years,
[2461.70 → 2463.60] as long as 120 years.
[2465.24 → 2466.12] But Noah believed
[2466.12 → 2466.84] in God's warning
[2466.84 → 2467.44] about things
[2467.44 → 2468.44] not yet seen.
[2469.12 → 2470.12] And you could see
[2470.12 → 2470.98] Noah's faith
[2470.98 → 2472.36] by what he did,
[2472.40 → 2473.28] by his obedience.
[2474.98 → 2475.18] Okay?
[2475.20 → 2476.30] So Noah believed
[2476.30 → 2476.66] in God,
[2476.72 → 2477.64] he obeyed God,
[2477.86 → 2478.48] what he said,
[2478.48 → 2479.62] and then the third thing
[2479.62 → 2480.70] Noah was commended for
[2480.70 → 2481.98] was he condemned
[2481.98 → 2482.50] the world.
[2483.46 → 2484.62] So notice what it says
[2484.62 → 2485.44] now in the second part
[2485.44 → 2486.14] of verse 7 there.
[2486.52 → 2487.24] By his faith,
[2487.30 → 2488.46] he condemned the world
[2488.46 → 2490.04] and became heir
[2490.04 → 2491.58] of the righteousness
[2491.58 → 2492.62] that is in keeping
[2492.62 → 2493.90] with faith.
[2494.46 → 2495.10] So now,
[2495.22 → 2496.00] what does that mean?
[2496.82 → 2497.60] That Noah
[2497.60 → 2499.84] condemned the world?
[2500.76 → 2502.50] I think Eugene Peterson's
[2502.50 → 2502.94] The Message
[2502.94 → 2504.60] says it very well.
[2504.80 → 2505.64] This is what it says.
[2506.58 → 2507.78] His act of faith,
[2507.78 → 2508.28] so this is kind of
[2508.28 → 2509.08] like a loose translation
[2509.08 → 2510.50] of that second part
[2510.50 → 2511.00] of verse 7.
[2511.00 → 2512.36] His act of faith
[2512.36 → 2514.00] drew a sharp line
[2514.56 → 2516.08] between the evil
[2516.08 → 2517.22] of the unbelieving world
[2517.22 → 2518.38] and the rightness
[2518.38 → 2519.82] of the believing world.
[2522.64 → 2524.62] And so to say that
[2524.62 → 2526.84] Noah condemned the world,
[2526.96 → 2527.40] it doesn't,
[2527.88 → 2529.26] don't imagine Noah
[2529.26 → 2530.68] going around scolding everybody.
[2531.32 → 2531.48] Right?
[2531.80 → 2533.40] That's not what it means.
[2533.60 → 2533.74] He,
[2533.98 → 2534.94] his act of faith,
[2534.94 → 2535.66] his obedience,
[2535.96 → 2536.76] his belief in God
[2536.76 → 2537.82] and building the ark,
[2537.94 → 2538.78] what it did
[2538.78 → 2540.08] was it kind of
[2540.08 → 2541.28] drew a line in the sand
[2541.28 → 2542.26] and said,
[2542.66 → 2542.84] look,
[2542.90 → 2544.46] this is what it looks like
[2544.46 → 2545.88] to believe in God
[2545.88 → 2547.30] and act in righteousness.
[2548.94 → 2549.34] And so,
[2549.54 → 2550.10] in other words,
[2550.16 → 2551.24] he condemned the world
[2551.24 → 2552.30] by his obedience.
[2553.66 → 2553.76] Right?
[2553.84 → 2555.24] Noah was obedient to God
[2555.24 → 2556.92] and he was obedient to God
[2556.92 → 2557.72] by his word
[2557.72 → 2559.02] and by his life,
[2559.06 → 2559.72] by what he said
[2559.72 → 2560.44] and by what he did.
[2561.38 → 2561.94] And so,
[2562.06 → 2562.98] what did he say?
[2563.80 → 2564.02] Well,
[2564.10 → 2564.42] Peter,
[2564.62 → 2565.46] in the letter
[2565.46 → 2566.18] in the New Testament
[2566.18 → 2567.00] of 2 Peter,
[2567.44 → 2568.18] calls Noah
[2568.18 → 2569.96] a preacher of righteousness.
[2570.90 → 2571.90] A preacher of righteousness.
[2572.24 → 2572.44] And so,
[2572.54 → 2572.74] therefore,
[2572.90 → 2573.52] we know that
[2573.52 → 2575.08] for all those years,
[2576.12 → 2577.50] for however long it took,
[2577.62 → 2578.46] hammering away,
[2579.20 → 2580.42] while he was building the ark,
[2580.50 → 2581.68] he took the opportunity
[2581.68 → 2582.62] to preach.
[2583.82 → 2584.02] Right?
[2584.08 → 2584.28] And so,
[2584.36 → 2585.46] remember Noah's surroundings.
[2585.62 → 2585.80] Right?
[2586.12 → 2587.02] The inclination
[2587.02 → 2588.12] of his neighbour's hearts
[2588.12 → 2588.68] were evil.
[2588.68 → 2590.16] There was violence
[2590.16 → 2591.66] and his neighbour's ways
[2591.66 → 2592.30] were corrupt.
[2593.42 → 2594.48] But I imagine
[2594.48 → 2596.22] word got around
[2596.22 → 2598.54] of Noah's project.
[2598.66 → 2598.78] Right?
[2598.84 → 2599.46] He's building
[2599.46 → 2601.48] this huge structure.
[2602.80 → 2603.86] No one had ever seen
[2603.86 → 2605.46] a building like this before
[2605.46 → 2607.06] and probably word got around
[2607.06 → 2608.00] and people would come
[2608.00 → 2609.36] and check it out.
[2610.28 → 2611.64] And maybe when a crowd
[2611.64 → 2612.24] had gathered,
[2612.38 → 2613.28] Noah would get down
[2613.28 → 2613.92] from his ladder,
[2614.58 → 2615.66] call the people over
[2615.66 → 2616.60] and tell them
[2616.60 → 2617.48] about God's warning.
[2617.48 → 2617.54] calling,
[2618.12 → 2619.58] call them to faith
[2619.58 → 2620.50] and repentance,
[2620.94 → 2621.98] to trust in the one
[2621.98 → 2622.78] true and living God
[2622.78 → 2623.50] and to turn
[2623.50 → 2625.20] from their corrupt ways.
[2626.44 → 2627.32] Other times,
[2627.40 → 2628.34] maybe he'd go out
[2628.34 → 2629.72] on preaching missions,
[2629.82 → 2630.00] right?
[2630.04 → 2631.04] Around the countryside,
[2631.56 → 2632.58] trying to warn people
[2632.58 → 2634.78] of a coming flood.
[2636.70 → 2638.04] And as he preached,
[2638.62 → 2639.86] as he hammered away
[2639.86 → 2641.16] building a boat
[2641.16 → 2641.72] in the middle
[2641.72 → 2642.38] of the wilderness,
[2643.40 → 2645.16] imagine the mocking,
[2645.50 → 2646.30] the ridicule
[2646.30 → 2647.28] that he would have received.
[2647.38 → 2648.54] They would have called him crazy.
[2650.72 → 2651.96] But not only was Noah
[2651.96 → 2653.06] a preacher of righteousness,
[2653.28 → 2654.24] he lived a life
[2654.24 → 2654.76] of righteousness.
[2655.86 → 2656.46] And so actually,
[2656.62 → 2657.52] four times
[2657.52 → 2658.36] in the scriptures,
[2658.72 → 2659.58] he is called
[2659.58 → 2660.68] righteous Noah.
[2661.88 → 2662.80] And it refers
[2662.80 → 2663.70] to his life.
[2664.08 → 2665.66] His life was a light
[2665.66 → 2666.74] that shined
[2666.74 → 2667.62] in the darkness
[2667.62 → 2668.34] of that world.
[2669.06 → 2670.08] His way of life
[2670.08 → 2670.90] was different
[2670.90 → 2672.32] from the wickedness
[2672.32 → 2672.86] that he saw
[2672.86 → 2673.56] all around him.
[2673.78 → 2674.58] And that difference
[2674.58 → 2675.50] was enough
[2675.50 → 2676.64] to act
[2676.64 → 2678.26] as condemnation.
[2679.58 → 2680.12] And so Noah,
[2680.24 → 2681.08] he preached it,
[2681.38 → 2682.40] he lived it,
[2682.50 → 2683.50] and his faith
[2683.50 → 2685.04] condemned the world
[2685.04 → 2685.92] by showing the world
[2685.92 → 2687.00] their lack of faith
[2687.00 → 2688.34] and their lack
[2688.34 → 2689.90] of righteousness.
[2691.66 → 2692.48] And so friends,
[2692.52 → 2693.66] those are the three reasons
[2693.66 → 2694.84] given for why God
[2694.84 → 2695.84] commended Noah,
[2695.96 → 2696.86] why God was pleased
[2696.86 → 2697.26] with Noah.
[2697.26 → 2698.22] He believed
[2698.22 → 2699.74] what God had warned,
[2699.86 → 2700.82] enough so that
[2700.82 → 2702.22] there was,
[2702.40 → 2703.04] even though there was
[2703.04 → 2703.86] no evidence
[2703.86 → 2705.74] of the coming flood,
[2705.90 → 2706.46] Noah believed.
[2707.42 → 2708.54] His faith could then
[2708.54 → 2709.66] be seen in his obedience,
[2709.88 → 2710.04] right?
[2710.10 → 2710.68] The construction
[2710.68 → 2711.90] of this enormous ark.
[2712.72 → 2713.62] And he condemned
[2713.62 → 2714.16] the world
[2714.16 → 2715.80] by his righteous words
[2715.80 → 2717.22] and by his righteous life.
[2718.58 → 2719.80] Now how is Noah
[2719.80 → 2721.24] an example for us
[2721.24 → 2721.90] today
[2721.90 → 2723.00] in our time
[2723.00 → 2723.42] of waiting,
[2723.52 → 2723.72] right?
[2724.18 → 2724.72] Because Noah
[2724.72 → 2725.32] was waiting
[2725.32 → 2726.90] for the coming
[2726.90 → 2727.48] of the Christ,
[2727.58 → 2728.38] the promised Messiah,
[2728.82 → 2729.70] and we too
[2729.70 → 2730.14] are waiting
[2730.14 → 2730.74] for Christ
[2730.74 → 2731.58] to come again.
[2732.54 → 2733.40] And all of these
[2733.40 → 2734.20] ancients
[2734.20 → 2735.48] in Hebrews 11
[2735.48 → 2736.94] are examples
[2736.94 → 2737.54] for us.
[2738.18 → 2738.98] That's what it says.
[2740.12 → 2741.58] So how is Noah
[2741.58 → 2743.04] an example for us
[2743.04 → 2743.82] in our time
[2743.82 → 2744.26] of waiting
[2744.26 → 2744.78] for Christ
[2744.78 → 2745.72] to appear once more?
[2746.48 → 2747.68] How is he an example?
[2747.86 → 2748.04] Well,
[2748.80 → 2749.84] Noah gets used
[2749.84 → 2750.70] in the New Testament
[2750.70 → 2752.20] as an example
[2752.20 → 2753.10] of being ready,
[2753.98 → 2755.16] of being ready
[2755.16 → 2757.02] for the coming judgment.
[2758.22 → 2758.32] Right?
[2758.40 → 2759.06] By faith,
[2759.74 → 2760.82] Noah built the ark
[2760.82 → 2761.54] and finally
[2761.54 → 2762.88] the day came
[2762.88 → 2764.36] when it was finished.
[2764.98 → 2765.20] Right?
[2765.28 → 2766.88] This big cargo ship,
[2767.26 → 2768.04] the last nail
[2768.04 → 2768.70] was placed,
[2768.82 → 2769.60] everything was ready,
[2769.84 → 2770.62] it was pitched
[2770.62 → 2771.62] within and without,
[2772.46 → 2773.42] and Noah gets
[2773.42 → 2774.28] into the ark
[2774.28 → 2775.48] along with his family
[2775.48 → 2776.40] and the animals
[2776.40 → 2777.90] as God commanded,
[2779.10 → 2779.88] and then the rains
[2779.88 → 2780.24] began.
[2782.04 → 2782.52] And nobody,
[2782.84 → 2783.72] you can imagine,
[2783.72 → 2784.94] pays attention much
[2784.94 → 2786.60] at first,
[2787.20 → 2788.44] but it keeps on raining
[2788.44 → 2789.48] for five days,
[2790.20 → 2791.06] ten days,
[2791.74 → 2792.52] twenty days.
[2794.02 → 2795.30] Nobody had responded
[2795.30 → 2796.32] to Noah's preaching,
[2797.02 → 2798.32] but now it was too late.
[2800.64 → 2801.70] This time,
[2802.22 → 2803.26] the warning comes
[2803.26 → 2803.90] not from the lips
[2803.90 → 2804.32] of Noah,
[2804.84 → 2805.78] but from the lips
[2805.78 → 2806.94] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2807.84 → 2809.20] When Jesus was asked
[2809.20 → 2810.04] about the day
[2810.04 → 2811.10] when God would judge
[2811.10 → 2812.02] between the righteous
[2812.02 → 2812.94] and the unrighteous,
[2813.80 → 2814.96] Jesus turns to Noah
[2814.96 → 2816.08] as an example.
[2817.10 → 2817.62] Okay, so listen
[2817.62 → 2818.40] as I read
[2818.40 → 2819.98] from Matthew 24.
[2820.76 → 2821.84] This is Jesus speaking.
[2822.50 → 2824.02] But about that day
[2824.02 → 2824.70] or hour
[2824.70 → 2825.82] no one knows,
[2826.20 → 2827.40] not even the angels
[2827.40 → 2828.00] in heaven,
[2828.10 → 2828.88] nor the Son,
[2829.16 → 2830.08] but only the Father.
[2830.94 → 2831.86] As it was
[2831.86 → 2832.80] in the days of Noah,
[2833.28 → 2834.02] so it will be
[2834.02 → 2834.60] at the coming
[2834.60 → 2835.54] of the Son of Man.
[2836.14 → 2836.98] For in the days
[2836.98 → 2837.90] before the flood,
[2838.04 → 2838.72] people were eating
[2838.72 → 2839.30] and drinking,
[2839.86 → 2840.80] marrying and giving
[2840.80 → 2841.50] in marriage
[2841.50 → 2842.50] up to the day
[2842.50 → 2843.86] Noah entered the ark.
[2844.56 → 2845.50] And they knew nothing
[2845.50 → 2846.58] about what would happen
[2846.58 → 2848.02] until the flood came
[2848.02 → 2848.98] and took them all away.
[2849.78 → 2851.12] That is how it will be
[2851.12 → 2851.90] at the coming
[2851.90 → 2853.50] of the Son of Man.
[2855.26 → 2855.46] Right?
[2855.78 → 2858.36] Jesus warns us
[2858.36 → 2860.22] that judgment is coming.
[2861.08 → 2862.48] And it is a warning
[2862.48 → 2863.60] given to us in love.
[2865.74 → 2867.24] And the way we prepare
[2867.24 → 2868.62] for the coming judgment
[2868.62 → 2870.56] is by heeding
[2870.56 → 2871.32] that warning.
[2871.44 → 2871.58] Right?
[2871.64 → 2872.44] And being ready.
[2873.70 → 2875.40] Will we be like Noah
[2875.40 → 2877.40] and believe God?
[2879.52 → 2879.78] You know,
[2879.88 → 2881.04] we don't know
[2881.04 → 2883.48] when we will die,
[2884.20 → 2885.58] but we all will.
[2886.64 → 2886.86] Right?
[2886.90 → 2887.72] And we do not know
[2887.72 → 2888.54] when Jesus Christ
[2888.54 → 2889.54] will suddenly appear,
[2889.70 → 2890.56] but one day
[2890.56 → 2891.18] he will.
[2892.42 → 2893.20] How do you like that
[2893.20 → 2893.94] for an Advent sermon?
[2893.94 → 2898.90] But whether we die first
[2898.90 → 2901.44] or Jesus returns,
[2901.64 → 2902.90] at that time,
[2903.30 → 2904.08] the opportunities
[2904.08 → 2905.16] for repentance
[2905.16 → 2906.38] will be over.
[2907.70 → 2907.96] You know,
[2908.02 → 2908.66] in Noah's day,
[2908.74 → 2909.42] it was foolish
[2909.42 → 2909.94] to wait
[2909.94 → 2910.60] and want to be
[2910.60 → 2911.10] in the ark
[2911.10 → 2912.20] once the rains came,
[2913.00 → 2913.88] when it was too late.
[2915.16 → 2916.40] And just as
[2916.40 → 2917.78] the word of God
[2917.78 → 2918.68] proved it true
[2918.68 → 2920.10] in the day of Noah,
[2920.32 → 2921.72] so it will prove true
[2921.72 → 2922.94] on the last day.
[2924.82 → 2925.70] And so friends,
[2925.82 → 2927.68] we have the same choice
[2927.68 → 2928.14] today
[2928.14 → 2929.48] as the people
[2929.48 → 2930.56] in Noah's time had.
[2930.70 → 2932.10] To heed God's warning
[2932.10 → 2933.60] and find salvation
[2933.60 → 2934.26] in the ark
[2934.26 → 2935.30] or to ignore
[2935.30 → 2936.04] that warning
[2936.04 → 2937.56] and to face judgment.
[2939.70 → 2940.10] And so then,
[2940.26 → 2941.36] how do we prepare
[2941.36 → 2943.06] for the coming day
[2943.06 → 2943.52] of judgment?
[2944.38 → 2944.70] Right?
[2944.76 → 2945.68] Not by building
[2945.68 → 2946.26] an ark,
[2946.84 → 2947.96] but by getting
[2947.96 → 2948.90] into the ark
[2948.90 → 2949.84] that God has already
[2949.84 → 2950.88] prepared for us
[2950.88 → 2951.82] and that ark,
[2952.32 → 2952.58] friends,
[2952.70 → 2953.82] is Jesus Christ.
[2954.70 → 2954.84] Right?
[2954.96 → 2956.26] Jesus is the ark.
[2956.76 → 2956.92] Right?
[2956.98 → 2958.10] He is our salvation
[2958.10 → 2958.84] and we are
[2958.84 → 2960.44] to hide ourselves
[2960.44 → 2961.78] in Christ.
[2962.68 → 2963.20] And the way
[2963.20 → 2964.02] that we do that
[2964.02 → 2964.50] is simply,
[2964.74 → 2965.08] like Noah,
[2965.22 → 2966.08] by faith.
[2966.76 → 2966.98] Right?
[2967.08 → 2968.16] Trusting that Jesus,
[2968.28 → 2968.88] the same Jesus
[2968.88 → 2970.20] who walked on the water,
[2970.62 → 2971.72] went to the cross
[2971.72 → 2973.04] and on the cross,
[2973.30 → 2974.54] he sunk under
[2974.54 → 2975.52] the judgment
[2975.52 → 2977.56] of God's wrath
[2977.56 → 2978.92] against all the evil
[2978.92 → 2979.46] and corruption
[2979.46 → 2981.00] of our hearts
[2981.00 → 2981.80] and of the world
[2981.80 → 2983.74] so that we would not
[2983.74 → 2984.50] be condemned,
[2985.18 → 2986.32] but that like Noah,
[2986.52 → 2987.30] we could instead
[2987.30 → 2988.14] become heirs
[2988.14 → 2989.02] of righteousness.
[2992.78 → 2993.26] Friends,
[2993.42 → 2994.80] Jesus tells us
[2994.80 → 2996.42] that he is coming back.
[2996.52 → 2997.18] He tells us that
[2997.18 → 2997.76] in his word.
[2998.86 → 2999.74] And this time,
[2999.80 → 3000.50] when he comes again,
[3000.54 → 3001.08] it's not going to be
[3001.08 → 3002.10] as a baby in a manger,
[3002.74 → 3003.82] but as the righteous
[3003.82 → 3005.28] judge of all humanity.
[3005.28 → 3007.64] And the question is,
[3007.78 → 3008.50] are you ready
[3008.50 → 3009.64] for his appearing?
[3010.42 → 3010.52] Right?
[3010.74 → 3012.88] Have you hid yourself
[3012.88 → 3014.76] in Jesus Christ?
[3018.04 → 3018.16] Right?
[3018.26 → 3019.22] Noah is
[3019.22 → 3021.12] an example for us
[3021.12 → 3021.88] of how to be ready.
[3022.76 → 3023.86] But how else
[3023.86 → 3024.86] is his story
[3024.86 → 3025.74] an example for us
[3025.74 → 3026.50] in our time of waiting?
[3026.60 → 3027.12] There's a second
[3027.12 → 3028.36] last thing I want to say.
[3028.36 → 3031.18] And that is
[3031.18 → 3033.04] that he is
[3033.04 → 3033.52] an example
[3033.52 → 3034.86] for us
[3034.86 → 3035.80] of how to live
[3035.80 → 3036.26] differently
[3036.26 → 3037.34] in the world
[3037.34 → 3038.14] around us
[3038.14 → 3039.48] while still living
[3039.48 → 3040.06] in the world.
[3041.00 → 3041.16] Okay?
[3041.42 → 3042.16] He is an example
[3042.16 → 3042.54] for us
[3042.54 → 3043.30] of how to live
[3043.30 → 3044.50] differently in the world
[3044.50 → 3045.50] while still living
[3045.50 → 3046.18] in the world.
[3046.26 → 3046.80] And so please
[3046.80 → 3047.36] don't just hear
[3047.36 → 3048.34] one side of that
[3048.34 → 3049.80] or one aspect
[3049.80 → 3050.42] of that, right?
[3050.44 → 3051.10] We are to live
[3051.10 → 3052.28] different from
[3052.28 → 3053.64] the world around us
[3053.64 → 3055.14] while still living
[3055.14 → 3056.16] in the world.
[3056.16 → 3057.84] So Noah was not
[3057.84 → 3058.88] a hermit, right?
[3058.92 → 3059.52] And we are not
[3059.52 → 3060.18] to retreat
[3060.18 → 3061.68] from the world either.
[3062.92 → 3063.40] However,
[3063.56 → 3064.20] where the world
[3064.20 → 3064.88] is corrupt
[3064.88 → 3066.00] and lives in disobedience
[3066.00 → 3066.46] to God,
[3066.56 → 3067.12] we are not
[3067.12 → 3067.86] to participate.
[3068.88 → 3069.44] And friends,
[3069.58 → 3070.32] that will not
[3070.32 → 3071.02] make us popular.
[3072.30 → 3072.74] Right?
[3072.82 → 3073.58] But there's no way
[3073.58 → 3074.20] around it.
[3074.58 → 3074.78] Right?
[3074.80 → 3075.90] We can't follow Jesus
[3075.90 → 3077.36] and think at the same time
[3077.36 → 3078.34] we are going to be
[3078.34 → 3079.18] popular
[3079.18 → 3080.90] in the world.
[3082.54 → 3083.46] But we do not
[3083.46 → 3084.20] spend our time
[3084.20 → 3084.92] scolding
[3084.92 → 3085.76] our neighbours
[3085.76 → 3086.34] for the way
[3086.34 → 3087.08] that they live.
[3087.96 → 3088.44] The way
[3088.44 → 3089.12] that we condemn
[3089.12 → 3089.54] the world
[3089.54 → 3090.84] is by our trust
[3090.84 → 3091.94] in the living God
[3091.94 → 3093.34] and by living
[3093.34 → 3094.52] according to
[3094.52 → 3095.28] his ways
[3095.28 → 3096.02] in love.
[3097.64 → 3098.14] Right?
[3098.18 → 3098.56] And that's all
[3098.56 → 3099.26] we have to do.
[3099.60 → 3100.46] That's all Jesus
[3100.46 → 3101.40] calls us to do.
[3102.92 → 3104.12] In the same way,
[3104.24 → 3105.02] Jesus showed
[3105.02 → 3106.14] the world,
[3106.72 → 3107.76] the world's darkness
[3107.76 → 3108.60] by walking
[3108.60 → 3109.36] among it,
[3110.02 → 3111.04] shining his light.
[3112.98 → 3113.72] But also,
[3113.92 → 3114.28] like Noah
[3114.28 → 3115.14] and like Jesus,
[3115.36 → 3116.06] we also must
[3116.06 → 3117.20] tell our neighbours
[3117.20 → 3118.80] of the coming
[3118.80 → 3119.16] judgment
[3119.16 → 3119.92] and how to be
[3119.92 → 3120.26] saved.
[3121.40 → 3122.52] Noah preached,
[3122.82 → 3123.36] he was a preacher
[3123.36 → 3123.84] of righteousness.
[3124.24 → 3125.26] Jesus was a preacher
[3125.26 → 3125.92] of righteousness.
[3126.80 → 3128.08] And so must we.
[3128.24 → 3128.38] Right?
[3128.42 → 3129.36] We are the missionary
[3129.36 → 3130.22] people of God.
[3130.44 → 3131.14] And the church,
[3131.30 → 3131.48] friends,
[3131.54 → 3132.60] is a rescue boat.
[3133.44 → 3134.64] The church is a rescue boat.
[3135.22 → 3135.42] Right?
[3135.50 → 3137.18] We're not a luxury cruise.
[3138.50 → 3139.34] There's nothing wrong
[3139.34 → 3139.86] with cruising,
[3139.86 → 3141.14] but that's not
[3141.14 → 3142.16] what the church is.
[3143.40 → 3143.54] Right?
[3143.58 → 3144.30] And so we are
[3144.30 → 3145.56] to invite people
[3145.56 → 3147.18] to believe in God
[3147.18 → 3148.18] and to obey him.
[3148.66 → 3149.82] We invite people
[3149.82 → 3150.56] into the safety
[3150.56 → 3151.34] of the ark
[3151.34 → 3152.84] with some urgency.
[3154.00 → 3155.16] And there's plenty
[3155.16 → 3155.82] of room aboard.
[3157.18 → 3158.24] And the ark
[3158.24 → 3159.26] and all inside it
[3159.26 → 3160.60] will survive
[3160.60 → 3161.40] the storm.
[3161.98 → 3162.46] Right?
[3162.52 → 3163.68] And the dangerous sea
[3163.68 → 3164.78] will turn
[3164.78 → 3165.86] into a peaceful kingdom.
[3167.48 → 3168.86] And so this Advent,
[3169.12 → 3169.28] you know,
[3169.28 → 3170.38] with all the things
[3170.38 → 3171.16] that are going on,
[3171.20 → 3172.00] all of our busyness
[3172.00 → 3173.84] and our hectic schedules
[3173.84 → 3175.22] and maybe our hectic hearts,
[3175.72 → 3176.82] let's consider
[3176.82 → 3178.76] the faith of Noah
[3178.76 → 3179.78] and imitate him.
[3180.56 → 3181.56] And we do that
[3181.56 → 3183.62] by preparing
[3183.62 → 3185.04] for Christ's coming
[3185.04 → 3185.76] and we prepare
[3185.76 → 3186.48] for Christ's coming
[3186.48 → 3187.36] by stepping
[3187.36 → 3188.26] into the ark.
[3188.90 → 3189.62] The ark
[3189.62 → 3190.92] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3191.50 → 3192.62] Hiding ourselves in him.
[3192.80 → 3193.74] And we do that by faith.
[3194.48 → 3195.48] So let me pray for us.
[3195.48 → 3195.54] Amen.
[3195.54 → 3195.60] Amen.
[3199.28 → 3199.64] Father,
[3199.72 → 3200.60] we ask this morning
[3200.60 → 3202.12] only that you would
[3202.12 → 3202.78] show everybody
[3202.78 → 3203.56] in this room
[3203.56 → 3206.12] what it means
[3206.12 → 3207.40] to hide themselves
[3207.40 → 3207.94] in you.
[3209.44 → 3210.22] And thank you,
[3210.30 → 3210.36] Lord,
[3210.40 → 3211.58] for sending your son
[3211.58 → 3212.38] to provide
[3212.38 → 3213.94] the way of salvation.
[3214.42 → 3214.96] Thank you
[3214.96 → 3215.76] that the crucified
[3215.76 → 3217.52] and resurrected one
[3217.52 → 3218.76] will return in judgment
[3218.76 → 3220.20] to renew all things.
[3221.12 → 3221.68] And Lord,
[3221.74 → 3222.46] would you let us
[3222.46 → 3223.06] be ready
[3223.06 → 3224.06] for that judgment
[3224.06 → 3225.18] even though
[3225.18 → 3226.28] we do not yet see it
[3226.28 → 3227.90] and it is not yet clear
[3227.90 → 3229.28] and it is not yet obvious.
[3230.14 → 3231.24] Give us the faith,
[3231.44 → 3231.98] Lord of Noah.
[3232.54 → 3233.68] And give us the courage
[3233.68 → 3235.04] to live lives
[3235.04 → 3236.04] of obedience to you.
[3236.92 → 3238.20] We pray this in Jesus' name
[3238.20 → 3238.88] and for his sake.
[3239.34 → 3239.58] Amen.
[3242.32 → 3243.24] Let's all stand
[3243.24 → 3244.82] and prepare
[3244.82 → 3246.44] as we get ready
[3246.44 → 3247.90] to sing another song.
[3247.96 → 3248.54] And it's that song
[3248.54 → 3249.30] By Faith.
[3249.88 → 3250.92] Also by the Getty's
[3250.92 → 3252.38] is based on Hebrews chapter 11.
[3252.86 → 3253.86] So let's sing that together.
[3256.28 → 3258.04] Sleeve
[3258.04 → 3283.24] след
[3283.24 → 3283.78] Why
[3283.78 → 3288.82] In faith we see the hand of God
[3288.82 → 3294.26] In the light of creation's grand design
[3294.26 → 3303.30] In the lives of those who prove his faithfulness
[3303.30 → 3309.36] Who walk by faith and not by sight
[3309.36 → 3315.56] By faith our fathers roam the air
[3315.56 → 3322.84] With the power of his promise in their hearts
[3322.84 → 3330.34] Of a holy city built by God's own hand
[3330.34 → 3335.50] A place where peace and justice reign
[3335.50 → 3342.00] We will stand as children of the promise
[3342.00 → 3347.32] We will face our eyes on him
[3347.32 → 3349.78] All souls we war
[3349.78 → 3357.62] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[3357.62 → 3363.12] We will walk by faith and not by sight
[3363.12 → 3369.54] By faith the prophets saw a day
[3369.54 → 3376.26] When the love for Messiah would appear
[3376.26 → 3384.46] With the power to break the chains of sin and death
[3384.46 → 3390.50] And rise triumphant from the grave
[3390.50 → 3395.82] By faith the church was called to go
[3395.82 → 3403.74] In the power of the Spirit to the lost
[3403.74 → 3411.00] To deliver captives and to preach good news
[3411.00 → 3415.82] In every corner of the earth
[3415.82 → 3422.32] We will stand as children of the promise
[3422.32 → 3427.76] We will face our eyes on him
[3427.76 → 3430.20] Our souls we war
[3430.20 → 3437.32] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[3437.32 → 3443.82] We will walk by faith and not by sight
[3443.82 → 3450.44] By faith the mountain shall be moved
[3450.44 → 3455.82] And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[3455.82 → 3462.32] For we know in Christ all things are possible
[3462.32 → 3468.32] For all who call upon his name
[3468.32 → 3475.32] We will stand as children of the promise
[3475.32 → 3480.32] We will face our eyes on him
[3480.32 → 3490.32] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[3490.32 → 3495.82] We will walk by faith and not by sight
[3495.82 → 3501.76] We will stand as children of the promise
[3501.76 → 3506.76] We will face our eyes on him
[3506.76 → 3516.76] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[3516.76 → 3522.26] We will walk by faith and not by sight
[3522.26 → 3539.46] So we come to the time in our service
[3539.46 → 3541.80] where we respond to God's mercy
[3541.80 → 3544.38] by the giving of our offerings to him
[3544.38 → 3550.00] And, you know, each Sunday we have a designated offering
[3550.00 → 3553.30] And this Sunday is for Reframe Ministries
[3553.30 → 3555.44] It used to be called Back to God Ministries
[3555.44 → 3557.96] And one of the so they produce literature
[3557.96 → 3560.88] This is a ministry of the Christian Reformed Church
[3560.88 → 3563.64] And one of the things they produce is the Today Devotional
[3563.64 → 3567.64] And so each day is a scripture reading
[3567.64 → 3570.66] And a short devotional thought
[3570.66 → 3572.18] And ending in a prayer
[3572.18 → 3574.34] So this is a great little resource
[3574.34 → 3578.60] That you can pick up on the foyer table if you'd like
[3578.60 → 3582.00] And so we support their ministry today
[3582.00 → 3583.04] With our offerings
[3583.04 → 3585.40] And may I ask our deacons to come forward
[3585.40 → 3586.82] And collect the offering for this morning
[3586.82 → 3593.02] All right, Lord estadounid

[3707.20 → 3708.20] Amen.
[3708.20 → 3709.20] Amen.
[3709.20 → 3714.20] Thank you, Marian, for leading us in piano today.
[3714.20 → 3715.20] That's very good.
[3715.20 → 3724.04] Let's turn to the Lord in prayer, lift our hearts to him in praying for some of the
[3724.04 → 3727.04] needs of our world and of our church community.
[3727.04 → 3729.04] So, please join me.
[3729.04 → 3734.04] Heavenly Father, we come before your holy throne today.
[3734.04 → 3739.04] And we ask, Lord, that you may pour out your spirit upon us.
[3739.04 → 3741.04] Please make us holy.
[3741.04 → 3743.04] Lord, please make us pure.
[3743.04 → 3747.04] And please make us like your beloved Son.
[3747.04 → 3754.04] Lord, as the temperature drops this time of year, we especially pray, Lord, for those
[3754.04 → 3759.04] in Ladder and all over the lower mainland who have nowhere to call home.
[3759.04 → 3765.04] Lord, give them a warm place to rest their heads and to heal their hearts and minds and
[3765.04 → 3768.04] bodies so that they can get back on their feet.
[3768.04 → 3770.04] Lord, enable them to move forward in dignity.
[3770.04 → 3776.04] We pray, Lord, that you would enable all the organizations who seek to aid these people
[3776.04 → 3782.04] who don't have a home, Lord, to help them in their times of darkness.
[3782.04 → 3786.04] And Lord, would you not only provide housing for those who need it, but also bring all those
[3786.04 → 3791.04] who need a home, Lord, into your kingdom, into your family.
[3791.04 → 3798.04] Father, this Advent season, would you help us, your people, to share the good news of the birth of Christ.
[3798.04 → 3807.04] Lord, give us the courage to point the people we know to the greatest gift anyone could ever receive,
[3807.04 → 3811.04] which is your Son, Jesus, and the salvation that he offers.
[3811.04 → 3818.04] Lord, awaken their hearts, Lord, those of our family, friends, and neighbours who don't yet believe in you.
[3818.04 → 3823.04] Awaken their hearts, Lord, to your beauty and lead them to your salvation,
[3823.04 → 3827.04] which they so desperately need more than anything else in the world.
[3827.04 → 3830.04] Lord, strip away all the lights and the glamour.
[3830.04 → 3835.04] Strip away the mythos that obscures what Christmas is truly about,
[3835.04 → 3842.04] so that all may see the awe and the glory of the incarnation of Jesus Christ,
[3842.04 → 3846.04] that God is Emmanuel. He is with us.
[3846.04 → 3849.04] We pray, Lord, for those in our church who are unwell at the moment.
[3849.04 → 3854.04] We pray especially for Doug and Eileen, for Mel and Shirley, for Sean.
[3854.04 → 3859.04] Lord, would you heal them in the various ways that they are in need of your healing.
[3859.04 → 3866.04] We also pray, also, not only for those who cannot make it this morning, but also for those who are here this morning,
[3866.04 → 3869.04] despite their ailing bodies and souls.
[3869.04 → 3874.04] Give all of us who are hurting the courage to seek out help,
[3874.04 → 3878.04] and those who can help the courage to seek out the hurting.
[3878.04 → 3883.04] Do not allow us, Lord, just to come and exchange handshakes and smiles in vain,
[3883.04 → 3893.04] but enable us, Lord, to share the true hurts and the true joys of our lives with those whom you have ordained for us to worship with as a church family.
[3893.04 → 3902.04] And, Lord, as we look upon the world that is so marred by violence and evil in so many different ways, Lord, we often feel helpless in the face of it all.
[3902.04 → 3910.04] But, Lord, we look to you, the one who is seated upon your throne, who is ordering all things according to your purposes,
[3910.04 → 3913.04] and who promises to return to judge the living and the dead.
[3913.04 → 3917.04] We thank you, Lord, for your kingdom of peace, which shall never end.
[3917.04 → 3922.04] And as we wait for your return, help us, Lord, to look to the cross,
[3922.04 → 3930.04] to lift the name of Jesus, and to love our neighbours by proclaiming the gospel always and everywhere.
[3930.04 → 3936.04] Lord, we pray all these things in the name of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3937.04 → 3943.04] I invite you to stand, and we go out with the blessing of God upon us.
[3943.04 → 3946.04] Join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall.
[3946.04 → 3953.04] And also on Thursday is our final coffee lets drop-in, Thursday morning for the new year.
[3953.04 → 3954.04] Of course, we'll resume.
[3954.04 → 3955.04] What? Two more?
[3955.04 → 3956.04] Two more.
[3956.04 → 3957.04] Two more.
[3957.04 → 3958.04] Two more.
[3958.04 → 3961.04] The bulletin is false.
[3961.04 → 3962.04] It's not false?
[3962.04 → 3963.04] Wait.
[3963.04 → 3964.04] The bulletin's right.
[3964.04 → 3965.04] I'm wrong.
[3965.04 → 3967.04] Just read your bulletin.
[3967.04 → 3968.04] So the bulletin is right.
[3968.04 → 3969.04] That's all that matters.
[3969.04 → 3970.04] Okay.
[3970.04 → 3975.04] Anyway, I invite you to stretch out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[3975.04 → 3984.04] The Lord God Almighty, the holy and undivided Trinity, guard you, save you, and bring you to that heavenly city.
[3984.04 → 3990.04] And the blessings of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you always.
[3990.04 → 3991.04] Amen.
[3991.04 → 3997.04] Amen.
[3997.04 → 4002.04] Thank you.
[4002.04 → 4005.04] Let the Lord crowns the beef Act and gorges of Lord God Not Un Yi.
[4005.04 → 4006.04] Let us see.
[4006.04 → 4015.04] Let the Lord crowns the human heart to His sight...
[4015.04 → 4019.40] God has spoken, promised light.
[4019.84 → 4024.76] Upon this throne our hope we raise.
[4025.22 → 4030.86] With grateful hearts we sing your praise.
[4031.82 → 4037.00] Praise God who calls all strife to cease.
[4037.00 → 4042.42] Whose kingdom reigns in holy peace.
[4042.42 → 4047.70] Through every step of grace we sing.
[4048.24 → 4052.44] The light's a song of harmony.
[4054.86 → 4059.76] Praise God whose love has drawn us near.
[4060.28 → 4065.38] Whose tender voice we long to hear.
[4065.38 → 4071.12] Through Christ the gift of grace is shown.
[4071.12 → 4077.56] We offer back what is your own.
[4078.70 → 4081.56] Amen.
[4082.08 → 4092.66] Amen.
[4092.88 → 4093.20] Amen.
