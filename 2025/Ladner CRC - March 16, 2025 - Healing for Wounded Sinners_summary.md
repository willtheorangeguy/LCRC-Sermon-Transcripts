• Introduction and context for Lamentations
• Description of the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BC
• Explanation of Lamentations as a poetic response to the destruction
• Purpose of the book of Laments: to guide readers on how to cry out to God in suffering, pain, and confusion
• Reading from Lamentations chapter 2, verses 1-10
• The speaker reads from Lamentations, discussing how God has poured out his wrath like fire on Jerusalem and destroyed its palaces and strongholds.
• The book of Lamentations is compared to a radio broadcast by Herbert Morrison about the Hindenburg disaster, where he asks "How?" in response to the unexpected tragedy.
• The question of "how" is also central to Lamentations, as it explores why God would allow such devastation to befall Jerusalem.
• Jerusalem's history as a city chosen by God for His people is recalled, and its current desolate state is contrasted with its former glory.
• The chapter from Lamentations that the speaker reads provides an answer to some of the questions about how this happened.
• God's faithfulness to judge and restore
• Israel's miscalculation that God would never judge his people due to their perceived favor
• The prophet Jeremiah exposing the true reason for Jerusalem's destruction: God's judgment against his people's sin
• The fulfillment of God's word and covenant curses in Deuteronomy
• God's active role in enacting judgment and destruction through various verbs attributed to Him
• God destroyed the homes and city of his people, comparing himself to an enemy who has swallowed them up.
• The destruction was not just physical, but also spiritual, with God no longer dwelling in or remembering his footstool (the Ark of the Covenant).
• The temple and its meeting place were destroyed, leading to a loss of remembrance of God's mighty acts and celebrations of their relationship.
• The altar for sacrifices was destroyed, bringing an end to forgiveness for sins through offerings before the Lord.
• With no more sacrifices or prophets receiving visions from the Lord, there is no hope for repairing the relationship with God.
• God withdrew his relationship from the people
• The people lost access to God's word and were unable to know him
• This was a result of their sin and refusal to listen to God
• Jeremiah wrote about this period in Jeremiah chapter 25, stating that for 23 years God sent prophets to them repeatedly but they did not listen
• Israel refused to listen to God and instead killed the prophets and listened to false ones
• God's faithfulness to his word
• The people's rejection of God and worshiping false gods
• God's judgment on his people for their sin and unrighteousness

• Themes of humanity, grief, and the impossibility of describing certain tragedies in a neutral or detached way
• Jeremiah is referred to as "the weeping prophet" due to his emotional response to God's judgment on Jerusalem.
• The people are called upon to join in lamenting and crying out to God, with Jeremiah urging them to express their grief through tears and prayer.

• This shows that God wants to have a relationship with His children and invites them to lament
• He listens and receives their prayers and tears, even when they are faithless towards Him
• God is both a judge who punishes sin and a merciful and faithful God who keeps His covenant with His people
• Jeremiah's question in Lamentations chapter 2 about who can heal the deep wound of God's people
• The answer comes from the whole Scripture, specifically through Christ's suffering and death on the cross
• The greatest terror of the cross was spiritual, not physical, as Christ drank the cup of God's wrath for humanity's sins
