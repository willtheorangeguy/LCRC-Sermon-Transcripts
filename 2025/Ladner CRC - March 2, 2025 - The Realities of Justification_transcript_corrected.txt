[0.00 → 6.00] I
[30.00 → 59.98] I love you.
[60.00 → 89.98] I love you.
[90.00 → 119.98] I love you.
[120.00 → 149.98] I love you.
[150.00 → 179.98] I love you.
[180.00 → 209.98] I love you.
[210.00 → 239.98] I love you.
[239.98 → 269.96] I love you.
[269.96 → 299.94] I love you.
[299.94 → 302.34] And after the service, I believe they will be serving cake.
[303.12 → 304.38] So this is a good day.
[304.80 → 312.34] So please stay afterwards and enjoy some cake as we celebrate the Lord's faithfulness to them in 65 years of marriage.
[312.34 → 317.34] I also believe it's 65 years of being part of this congregation.
[317.34 → 318.26] Yeah.
[318.78 → 319.00] Right?
[319.56 → 319.82] Yeah.
[320.20 → 321.94] So that is a big deal.
[321.94 → 351.92] A few other announcements.
[351.94 → 352.94] Cadets and I love you.
[381.94 → 382.94] So this is a good day.
[382.94 → 383.94] So this is a good day.
[383.94 → 388.94] So this is a good day.
[388.94 → 389.94] And the funeral service for, you know, I love you.
[389.94 → 390.94] And I love you.
[390.94 → 394.94] And I love you.
[394.94 → 396.94] I love you.
[396.94 → 403.94] So now, let's prepare our hearts.
[403.94 → 408.94] So now, let's prepare our hearts to worship the Lord this morning.
[408.94 → 417.38] And in Scripture, the centre of who you are as a person is your heart.
[417.38 → 418.42] Right?
[418.42 → 422.04] The Bible talks about our hearts as like the centre of who we are.
[422.04 → 425.76] And so here's my question to you this morning.
[426.80 → 428.72] Where is your heart this morning?
[431.16 → 435.40] Where is your heart at when you come here this morning?
[435.50 → 437.54] You know, some of us come and we come.
[437.66 → 439.58] Our hearts are anxious, and they're stressed.
[439.58 → 444.12] Some of us come with hearts that are full and joyful and content.
[445.12 → 450.36] Others, our hearts are distracted, or they're disappointed, or they're divided.
[451.58 → 454.92] So as we come, check in with your heart.
[455.34 → 457.12] Where is your heart this morning?
[457.12 → 464.00] And we are invited this morning to come and to lift our hearts.
[464.22 → 466.20] To lift them up to the Lord in worship.
[466.60 → 471.34] Because in worshipping him, that's when our hearts truly find their rest.
[472.18 → 476.12] It's in worshipping God that our hearts can find their purpose.
[476.94 → 480.44] They can find peace in no matter what circumstances we're facing.
[481.64 → 486.66] And we can find in Jesus the most reliable friend that we have ever had.
[488.02 → 491.76] So let's hear God call us to worship this morning.
[492.58 → 495.28] Our call to worship comes from Psalm 145.
[495.46 → 496.76] It will be a call and response.
[496.92 → 497.38] I'll begin.
[497.96 → 500.52] And then I'll ask you to read along where it has the double arrows.
[502.86 → 506.02] I will exalt you, my God, the King.
[506.14 → 508.46] I will praise your name forever and ever.
[509.40 → 514.72] Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[514.72 → 515.24] Together.
[515.24 → 519.70] Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[519.96 → 522.94] His greatness no one can fathom.
[523.84 → 527.00] One generation commends your works to another.
[527.58 → 529.34] They tell of your mighty acts.
[530.14 → 535.84] They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[535.84 → 540.84] The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.
[541.48 → 542.84] The Lord is good to all.
[542.94 → 545.80] He has compassion on all he has made.
[546.48 → 549.80] My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[549.80 → 555.42] Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[555.42 → 562.60] Would you join your hearts with me as we pray a prayer of adoration?
[563.00 → 563.64] Let's pray together.
[563.64 → 567.76] Father, our triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[568.36 → 571.40] What can we give you that is not already yours?
[571.40 → 575.44] Because, Lord, everything good comes from you.
[575.58 → 578.32] You are also good to all.
[579.04 → 581.24] Your mercy is over all that you have made.
[582.26 → 586.08] And so we come, and we can only give you praise and thanks and honour.
[586.92 → 588.24] We can extol you.
[588.34 → 591.50] We can commend your works to one another.
[591.50 → 594.16] Father, we can speak of your awesome deeds.
[595.60 → 599.14] To praise you is fitting because of who you are, O God.
[599.76 → 603.32] To praise you is fitting for us because of who you've made us to be.
[604.52 → 610.98] To lift you up in our hearts is to live according to your purpose and your plan for us.
[611.54 → 615.40] And so we thank you for a day when we can come to worship you.
[615.74 → 619.72] Not only in our hearts, but with our minds, our souls, our lips,
[619.72 → 621.86] and truly our whole being.
[622.94 → 627.04] And we do not simply sit, but from the time we come in,
[627.40 → 631.38] when that call to worship goes out, we are worshipping you.
[632.46 → 635.26] So, Lord, would you be with us by your spirit in this time of worship
[635.26 → 637.34] that we might receive your blessing.
[637.64 → 638.54] For Jesus' sake.
[639.08 → 639.40] Amen.
[640.86 → 643.82] Let's stand and let's hear God's greeting to us this morning.
[645.26 → 646.70] This is what the Lord says.
[646.70 → 651.80] The Lord is righteous in all of his ways and faithful in all he does.
[652.24 → 655.74] The Lord is near to all who call on him,
[656.40 → 658.00] to all who call on him in truth.
[659.04 → 660.90] Friends, may the peace of the Lord be with you.
[661.34 → 662.66] And also with you.
[662.80 → 663.16] Thank you.
[663.26 → 663.66] Let's turn.
[663.76 → 665.44] Let's greet one another in that peace.
[665.44 → 669.02] � Teeth Scripture.
[669.24 → 678.14] let's look at those.
[690.36 → 690.64] Okay.
[690.64 → 691.54] Now, how do I get it?
[691.54 → 692.24] Introit.
[692.24 → 722.22] Thank you.
[722.24 → 731.46] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.

[790.80 → 803.98] Praise to the Lord, who will prosper Your work and avenge you.
[803.98 → 813.30] Surely His goodness and mercy shall give the attention.
[813.30 → 822.78] Honour and who, what the Almighty can do.
[822.78 → 829.78] As with His love He befriends you.
[829.78 → 851.44] Are you thirsty?
[851.44 → 854.44] Are you empty?
[854.44 → 860.78] Come and drink these living waters.
[860.78 → 866.44] Tired and broken, peace and spoken.
[866.44 → 871.82] Rest beside these living waters.
[871.82 → 878.82] Christ is calling.
[878.82 → 879.82] Christ is calling.

[885.82 → 886.82] Will lay your life down.
[886.82 → 890.82] Will lay your life down.
[890.82 → 892.82] All the old one.
[892.82 → 896.82] Rise up in these living waters.
[896.82 → 900.82] There's a river that flows with mercy and love.
[900.82 → 910.82] Bringing joy to the city of our God.
[910.82 → 913.82] There our hope is secure.
[913.82 → 917.82] Do not fear anyone.
[917.82 → 923.82] Praise the Lord of living waters.
[923.82 → 924.82] The Eocайтør Church.
[924.82 → 932.82] For God is eternal, good Spirit and mercy were marching.
[932.82 → 938.82] How can we do this?
[938.82 → 940.82] 希望 meet Jesus.
[940.82 → 944.82] Your beautiful5000 available to live!
[944.82 → 946.82] I will have you through His love.
[946.82 → 947.82] May God bless you.
[947.82 → 948.82] Have you through His love and glory.
[948.82 → 951.82] Will dwell together Your world and glory motif.
[951.82 → 955.32] that flows with mercy
[955.32 → 958.08] and thou bring joy
[958.08 → 961.98] to the city of our God.
[962.72 → 965.44] Where our hope is secure,
[965.44 → 968.44] do not fear anymore.
[969.72 → 974.44] Praise the Lord of many waters.
[974.44 → 981.06] Are you thirsty?
[981.92 → 984.22] Are you empty?
[984.94 → 989.00] Come and drink these living waters.
[990.78 → 992.86] Love, forgiveness,
[993.78 → 996.32] fast and boundless,
[996.76 → 1000.90] Christ sees our living waters.
[1000.90 → 1004.86] There's a river that flows
[1004.86 → 1009.16] with mercy and thou bring joy
[1009.16 → 1013.06] to the city of our God.

[1020.68 → 1024.60] Praise the Lord of many waters.
[1025.98 → 1028.80] Where our hope is secure,

[1039.50 → 1039.58] Praise the Lord of many waters.
[1053.58 → 1056.90] So I invite you to open your brown Bible,
[1057.08 → 1057.88] that's in your pew,
[1058.42 → 1060.38] to page 410.
[1061.02 → 1062.90] And our first scripture reading for today
[1062.90 → 1064.48] will be Psalm 25.
[1065.78 → 1068.66] And you can also,
[1068.78 → 1069.78] we'll have the scripture
[1069.78 → 1071.44] on the overhead as well.
[1072.98 → 1074.92] So page 410,
[1076.30 → 1076.98] the Psalms,
[1078.32 → 1079.18] Psalm 25,
[1079.56 → 1080.32] a Psalm of David.
[1080.32 → 1084.14] To you,
[1084.28 → 1084.84] O Lord,
[1084.84 → 1086.26] I lift my soul.
[1086.80 → 1088.22] In you trust,
[1088.30 → 1088.96] O my God.
[1089.70 → 1091.48] Do not let me be put to shame,
[1091.56 → 1093.46] nor let my enemies triumph over me.
[1094.42 → 1096.36] No one whose hope is in you
[1096.36 → 1098.14] will ever be put to shame.
[1098.80 → 1100.24] But they will be put to shame
[1100.24 → 1101.98] who are treacherous without excuse.
[1102.74 → 1104.08] Show me your ways,
[1104.20 → 1104.60] O Lord.
[1104.72 → 1106.20] Teach me your paths.
[1107.08 → 1108.72] Guide me in your truth
[1108.72 → 1110.02] and teach me.
[1110.72 → 1112.40] For you are God,
[1112.52 → 1113.12] my Saviour.
[1113.58 → 1114.96] And my hope is in you
[1114.96 → 1116.06] all day long.
[1116.88 → 1117.82] Remember, O Lord,
[1117.92 → 1119.12] your great mercy and love,
[1119.20 → 1121.22] for they are from of old.
[1122.10 → 1124.00] Remember not the sins of my youth
[1124.00 → 1125.18] and my rebellious ways.
[1126.06 → 1127.10] According to your love,
[1127.16 → 1127.82] remember me,
[1127.90 → 1129.22] for you are good, O Lord.
[1130.02 → 1131.90] Good and upright is the Lord.
[1132.66 → 1132.98] Therefore,
[1133.44 → 1135.80] he instructs sinners in his ways.
[1136.40 → 1137.60] He guides the humble
[1137.60 → 1138.44] in what is right
[1138.44 → 1139.80] and teaches them his way.
[1140.68 → 1142.10] All the ways of the Lord
[1142.10 → 1143.78] are loving and faithful
[1143.78 → 1145.28] for those who keep
[1145.28 → 1146.74] the demands of his covenant.
[1147.20 → 1148.34] For the sake of your name,
[1148.40 → 1148.74] O Lord,
[1148.84 → 1150.04] forgive my iniquity,
[1150.42 → 1151.18] though it is great.
[1152.30 → 1153.74] Who then is the man
[1153.74 → 1154.90] that fears the Lord?
[1155.60 → 1156.68] He will instruct him
[1156.68 → 1158.06] in the way chosen for him.
[1158.70 → 1160.12] He will spend his days
[1160.12 → 1160.86] in prosperity,
[1161.22 → 1162.28] and his descendants
[1162.28 → 1163.76] will inherit the land.
[1164.56 → 1165.88] The Lord confides
[1165.88 → 1166.92] in those who fear him.
[1166.92 → 1168.14] He makes his covenant
[1168.14 → 1168.94] known to them.
[1169.76 → 1171.06] My eyes are ever
[1171.06 → 1171.70] on the Lord,
[1172.12 → 1173.94] for only he will release
[1173.94 → 1175.18] my feet from the snare.
[1175.90 → 1176.66] Turn to me
[1176.66 → 1178.36] and be gracious to me,
[1178.76 → 1179.70] for I am lonely
[1179.70 → 1180.44] and afflicted.
[1181.04 → 1182.50] The troubles of my heart
[1182.50 → 1183.28] have multiplied.
[1183.80 → 1185.02] Free me from my anguish.
[1185.48 → 1186.96] Look upon my anguish,
[1187.14 → 1187.70] my affliction,
[1187.84 → 1188.60] and my distress,
[1189.02 → 1190.66] and take away all my sins.
[1191.44 → 1192.52] See how my enemies
[1192.52 → 1193.28] have increased
[1193.28 → 1194.06] and how fiercely
[1194.06 → 1194.72] they hate me.
[1195.64 → 1196.68] Guard my life.
[1197.30 → 1197.96] Rescue me.
[1198.54 → 1199.86] Let me not be put to shame,
[1199.96 → 1201.28] for I take refuge in you.
[1202.06 → 1202.84] May integrity
[1202.84 → 1204.22] and uprightness
[1204.22 → 1205.08] protect me,
[1205.34 → 1206.86] because my hope
[1206.86 → 1207.50] is in you.
[1208.02 → 1208.84] Redeem Israel,
[1208.94 → 1209.38] O God,
[1209.62 → 1210.62] from all their troubles.
[1211.42 → 1212.12] This is the word
[1212.12 → 1212.54] of the Lord.
[1212.54 → 1217.78] So, I was reminded
[1217.78 → 1218.70] earlier this week
[1218.70 → 1220.10] that next Sunday,
[1220.74 → 1221.64] I hope I'm not mistaken,
[1221.78 → 1222.40] but next Sunday
[1222.40 → 1223.64] is Daylight Savings.
[1224.62 → 1225.72] And so, we are coming
[1225.72 → 1226.56] through this season
[1226.56 → 1227.76] of shorter days,
[1227.90 → 1229.06] longer nights.
[1229.88 → 1231.54] And in this season,
[1231.62 → 1232.48] we find ourselves
[1232.48 → 1233.70] longing for light.
[1235.08 → 1235.88] And also, you know,
[1235.94 → 1236.78] we've been in this season
[1236.78 → 1237.38] of epiphany,
[1237.54 → 1238.94] and we're reminded
[1238.94 → 1239.62] that Jesus,
[1240.54 → 1241.32] during this season,
[1241.32 → 1242.10] we're reminded
[1242.10 → 1242.94] that he is the light
[1242.94 → 1243.56] of the world.
[1244.82 → 1245.94] And that he has come
[1245.94 → 1247.08] to rescue us
[1247.08 → 1247.74] from the darkness
[1247.74 → 1248.42] of sin,
[1249.00 → 1250.18] and to restore us
[1250.18 → 1251.28] to relationship
[1251.28 → 1252.12] with God our Father.
[1253.46 → 1254.84] And when we are confronted
[1254.84 → 1255.70] with the light
[1255.70 → 1256.50] of Christ
[1256.50 → 1257.46] through his word,
[1257.90 → 1258.86] we see the ways
[1258.86 → 1259.90] that our hearts
[1259.90 → 1261.02] have failed
[1261.02 → 1262.52] to reflect Christ's love
[1262.52 → 1263.20] in our actions,
[1263.34 → 1264.00] in our words,
[1264.34 → 1265.26] in our thoughts,
[1266.10 → 1267.16] and that we have ignored
[1267.16 → 1267.78] and offended
[1267.78 → 1268.92] against his commands.
[1270.36 → 1270.64] And so,
[1270.64 → 1271.08] we come now
[1271.08 → 1271.56] to this time
[1271.56 → 1272.16] of confession,
[1273.02 → 1273.92] and we confess
[1273.92 → 1274.78] our sins to God,
[1274.92 → 1276.82] trusting in Christ
[1276.82 → 1278.02] as our Saviour
[1278.02 → 1278.82] and our Lord.
[1279.70 → 1280.12] And so,
[1280.28 → 1281.08] I will lead us
[1281.08 → 1281.90] in a time of prayer,
[1282.80 → 1284.08] and then I will give us
[1284.08 → 1284.50] a moment
[1284.50 → 1286.06] for silent reflection
[1286.06 → 1286.62] afterwards,
[1286.92 → 1287.68] and that's a time
[1287.68 → 1288.80] for you to silently
[1288.80 → 1290.10] and personally
[1290.10 → 1292.78] confess your own sins
[1292.78 → 1293.40] to God.
[1294.42 → 1294.82] And so,
[1294.96 → 1296.06] let's pray together,
[1296.06 → 1297.32] and as we do so,
[1297.42 → 1298.72] we come relying
[1298.72 → 1299.84] on the Holy Spirit
[1299.84 → 1301.42] to guide us
[1301.42 → 1302.24] into confession
[1302.24 → 1303.82] and towards
[1303.82 → 1304.46] the forgiveness
[1304.46 → 1305.70] that is ours
[1305.70 → 1306.18] in Christ.
[1306.62 → 1307.40] Let's pray together.
[1307.40 → 1310.12] O Lord,
[1310.22 → 1311.08] you have created
[1311.08 → 1313.00] us to praise you,
[1313.72 → 1314.92] but our lips
[1314.92 → 1315.96] are often closed.
[1316.84 → 1318.20] We spend our breath
[1318.20 → 1319.14] complaining.
[1319.84 → 1321.70] We waste our words
[1321.70 → 1323.38] in judging others.
[1324.48 → 1325.46] With the same tongue,
[1325.58 → 1326.68] we bless our Lord
[1326.68 → 1327.28] and Father,
[1328.22 → 1329.26] and we curse people
[1329.26 → 1330.20] made in the image
[1330.20 → 1330.64] of God.
[1331.64 → 1332.72] From the same mouth
[1332.72 → 1333.60] come cursing
[1333.60 → 1334.70] and blessing.
[1335.54 → 1336.18] These things
[1336.18 → 1337.26] ought not to be so.
[1338.50 → 1338.80] And so,
[1338.86 → 1339.94] we turn back to you
[1339.94 → 1340.50] now, Lord,
[1340.56 → 1341.06] in repentance.
[1342.02 → 1343.58] We return to you
[1343.58 → 1344.66] as our centre.
[1346.28 → 1346.56] Jesus,
[1346.84 → 1347.80] you secured
[1347.80 → 1349.32] God's mercy for us.
[1350.40 → 1351.52] Pour God's love
[1351.52 → 1352.66] into our hearts
[1352.66 → 1353.58] through the Holy Spirit.
[1353.96 → 1354.94] Flood our hearts
[1354.94 → 1355.88] afresh this morning
[1355.88 → 1356.64] with your mercy
[1356.64 → 1357.40] and your grace.
[1358.68 → 1359.32] And we,
[1359.54 → 1360.06] in response,
[1360.12 → 1361.04] will pour forth
[1361.04 → 1361.78] praise
[1361.78 → 1364.90] for your everlasting love,
[1364.96 → 1365.86] for your forgiveness
[1365.86 → 1366.68] of our sins.
[1367.30 → 1368.68] And we will sing aloud
[1368.68 → 1369.46] of your righteousness
[1369.46 → 1370.50] given to us
[1370.50 → 1371.94] by your grace alone.
[1372.26 → 1373.96] For Jesus' name.
[1375.06 → 1375.98] And in Jesus' name
[1375.98 → 1376.36] we pray.
[1376.58 → 1376.88] Amen.
[1376.88 → 1377.00] Amen.
[1377.00 → 1377.04] Amen.
[1377.04 → 1377.08] Amen.
[1377.08 → 1377.14] Amen.
[1377.14 → 1379.08] Amen.
[1379.08 → 1381.04] Amen.
[1381.04 → 1381.08] Amen.
[1381.08 → 1383.04] Amen.
[1383.04 → 1385.08] Amen.
[1385.08 → 1386.00] Amen.
[1386.00 → 1387.00] Amen.
[1387.00 → 1388.08] Amen.
[1388.08 → 1389.08] Amen.
[1389.08 → 1389.14] Amen.
[1389.14 → 1390.14] Amen.
[1390.14 → 1391.10] Amen.
[1391.78 → 1399.20] Amen.
[1399.98 → 1400.64] So Mary,
[1400.72 → 1401.74] are we playing a song next?
[1402.06 → 1402.28] Yeah.
[1402.46 → 1402.60] Okay,
[1402.68 → 1403.32] so remain seated
[1403.32 → 1404.26] and we'll sing
[1404.26 → 1405.12] another song here.
[1405.12 → 1405.48] Amen.
[1405.48 → 1406.62] Amen.
[1406.76 → 1406.90] Amen.
[1407.98 → 1409.16] Amen.
[1409.16 → 1409.76] Amen.
[1409.88 → 1410.04] Amen.
[1410.88 → 1413.50] Amen.
[1413.50 → 1436.76] Oh Lord, you know me and search me out
[1436.76 → 1441.66] My habits and thoughts, my secret doubts
[1441.66 → 1446.70] My dreams at night, the words of my mouth
[1446.70 → 1450.70] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1450.70 → 1456.02] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1456.02 → 1464.12] I know not a lot of heart and mind
[1464.12 → 1468.66] My wandering soul, my sleepless eyes
[1468.66 → 1473.70] I long for you, but from you, I hide
[1473.70 → 1477.70] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1477.70 → 1482.70] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1482.70 → 1491.74] Though darkness covers my open sight
[1491.74 → 1496.64] And night overtakes my troubled mind
[1496.64 → 1501.58] In darkness you, my delight will shine
[1501.58 → 1506.62] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1506.62 → 1510.62] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1510.62 → 1518.88] Before my birth you composed my frame
[1518.88 → 1523.92] You gazed in my eyes and knew my name
[1523.92 → 1528.90] You rode with love each one of my days
[1529.66 → 1532.88] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1532.88 → 1537.92] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1537.92 → 1542.96] Where can I run from your love
[1542.96 → 1544.96] Where can I run from your love
[1544.96 → 1546.96] Where can I run from your love
[1546.96 → 1547.96] Where can I run from your love so deep
[1547.96 → 1548.96] So well-less and strong
[1548.96 → 1549.96] So well-less and strong
[1549.96 → 1550.96] So rich, so free
[1550.96 → 1554.96] Nor I, nor doubt can separate me
[1554.96 → 1556.96] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1556.96 → 1560.38] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1560.38 → 1565.78] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1565.78 → 1570.50] In you, oh Lord, I am found
[1570.50 → 1575.96] Oh, in you, oh Lord, I am found
[1575.96 → 1586.94] Let's stand and hear together
[1586.94 → 1588.64] The words of assurance
[1588.64 → 1590.82] That come to us from God's word
[1590.82 → 1594.12] From 1 Peter chapter 2
[1594.12 → 1598.42] He himself bore our sins
[1598.42 → 1600.32] In his body on the cross
[1600.32 → 1602.90] So that we might die to sins
[1602.90 → 1605.44] And live for righteousness
[1605.44 → 1608.54] By his wounds you have been healed
[1608.54 → 1612.12] For you were like sheep going astray
[1612.12 → 1614.30] But now you have returned
[1614.30 → 1616.62] To the shepherd and overseer
[1616.62 → 1617.86] Of your souls
[1617.86 → 1619.16] Praise be to God
[1619.16 → 1620.36] Remain standing
[1620.36 → 1621.82] And we'll sing another song
[1621.82 → 1623.12] For you of God
[1623.12 → 1625.60] Tommy God
[1625.60 → 1626.60] Amen.
[1655.60 → 1657.60] Amen.
[1685.60 → 1687.60] Amen.
[1715.60 → 1717.60] Amen.
[1745.60 → 1747.60] Amen.
[1775.60 → 1777.60] Amen.
[1805.60 → 1807.60] Amen.
[1807.60 → 1808.60] Amen.
[1808.60 → 1809.60] Amen.
[1809.60 → 1810.60] Amen.
[1810.60 → 1811.60] Amen.
[1811.60 → 1812.60] Amen.
[1812.60 → 1813.60] Amen.
[1813.60 → 1814.60] Amen.
[1814.60 → 1815.60] Amen.
[1815.60 → 1816.60] Amen.
[1816.60 → 1817.60] Amen.
[1817.60 → 1821.60] Okay, so the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1821.60 → 1822.60] Amen.
[1822.60 → 1823.60] Amen.
[1823.60 → 1824.60] Amen.
[1824.60 → 1825.60] Amen.
[1825.60 → 1826.60] Amen.
[1826.60 → 1827.60] Amen.
[1827.60 → 1828.60] Amen.
[1828.60 → 1829.60] Amen.
[1829.60 → 1834.60] And while they're headed out, I invite you to open again your Bibles to the book of Romans.
[1834.60 → 1841.60] We have been in the book of Romans since the fall, but kind of off and on.
[1841.60 → 1851.60] And actually, beginning next week, we will take another pause and turn in the season of Lent to a new sermon series on the book of Lamentations.
[1851.60 → 1853.60] I've never preached on Lamentations.
[1853.60 → 1856.60] I'd be surprised if you've ever heard a sermon on Lamentations.
[1856.60 → 1858.60] Maybe one in chapter three.
[1858.60 → 1866.60] But we will work our way through that book for the season of Lent, learning what it means for us to be people of lament.
[1866.60 → 1871.60] But for today, we are in Romans chapter three, looking at the first five verses.
[1871.60 → 1873.60] Sorry, chapter five.
[1873.60 → 1877.60] Turn to Romans chapter five in the first five verses.
[1877.60 → 1878.60] Okay.
[1878.60 → 1884.60] So that's on page 839.
[1884.60 → 1891.60] Let's give our attention to the reading of God's word, Romans 5, beginning in verse one.
[1891.60 → 1907.60] Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[1907.60 → 1912.60] And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[1912.60 → 1923.60] Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance character, and character hope.
[1923.60 → 1933.60] And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.
[1933.60 → 1937.60] This is the word of the Lord.
[1937.60 → 1942.60] Would you join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word?
[1942.60 → 1944.60] Let's pray.
[1944.60 → 1953.60] Our Father in heaven, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us because you love us.
[1953.60 → 1962.60] And we ask you this morning that you would, by your spirit, grant us such a clear vision of your love and your grace and your mercy,
[1962.60 → 1969.60] that we would be sustained by joy and that we may grow in hope.
[1969.60 → 1974.60] Would you guide us now in your truth by the power of your Holy Spirit?
[1974.60 → 1977.60] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[1977.60 → 1978.60] Amen.
[1978.60 → 1987.60] So I wonder how many of you have ever heard of Magnetic Hill in Moncton, New Brunswick?
[1987.60 → 1988.60] Yeah?
[1988.60 → 1989.60] Some of you have.
[1989.60 → 1990.60] Wow.
[1990.60 → 1991.60] Nice.
[1991.60 → 1993.60] Have any of you ever been there?
[1993.60 → 1995.60] Oh, I'm actually shocked.
[1995.60 → 1996.60] Many of you have been there.
[1996.60 → 1997.60] Okay.
[1997.60 → 1998.60] That's awesome.
[1998.60 → 2000.60] I have not been there, but I heard about this.
[2000.60 → 2005.60] So if you know about it, don't tell the secret yet.
[2005.60 → 2015.60] So what happens for those of you who don't know is you drive to the bottom of a hill, and then you put your car in neutral and seemingly by magic,
[2015.60 → 2019.60] your car just begins to roll backwards uphill.
[2019.60 → 2021.60] Oh, that's very, yeah.
[2021.60 → 2023.60] So here's a photo.
[2023.60 → 2024.60] I don't know.
[2024.60 → 2028.60] We're looking forward to our TV screens when we'll be able to see it even clearer.
[2028.60 → 2033.60] But would you say looking at this photo that this car is driving uphill or downhill?
[2033.60 → 2034.60] Down.
[2034.60 → 2035.60] Right?
[2035.60 → 2038.60] It looks like he's driving downhill.
[2038.60 → 2040.60] Now we're going to show a little video clip.
[2040.60 → 2061.60] Watch what happens when the driver puts the car in neutral.
[2061.60 → 2062.60] Magnetic hill.
[2062.60 → 2063.60] Right?
[2063.60 → 2069.60] Now the secret of Magnetic Hill, and I'm not revealing any like super secrets.
[2069.60 → 2070.60] They tell you.
[2070.60 → 2074.60] But actually you're not rolling uphill.
[2074.60 → 2076.60] There are no magnets in the ground.
[2076.60 → 2078.60] There are no magnets anywhere.
[2078.60 → 2083.60] What truly looks to be uphill is actually a slight downhill.
[2083.60 → 2090.60] So that white post there is actually like 10 feet higher than the vantage point of where we're standing.
[2090.60 → 2097.60] But because of the surrounding terrain and the way the trees and the vegetations grow beside the road,
[2097.60 → 2099.60] your eye gets tricked.
[2099.60 → 2101.60] It's an optical illusion.
[2101.60 → 2108.60] But of course, the reality of gravity doesn't care about what the hill looks like.
[2108.60 → 2111.60] The actual slope is the reality.
[2111.60 → 2112.60] That's what matters.
[2112.60 → 2116.60] If you are on a downhill, you will roll down.
[2116.60 → 2119.60] Even if it looks like an uphill.
[2119.60 → 2128.60] And similarly, Paul tells us in our passage that there are some realities of justification.
[2128.60 → 2143.60] He tells us that having our sins forgiven and being robed in the righteousness of God means that there are now some things that are objectively true about us,
[2143.60 → 2147.60] even when it doesn't feel like they are.
[2147.60 → 2150.60] And sometimes in the Christian life, that's the way it is.
[2150.60 → 2159.60] God gives us all of these promises, these amazing truths that are real about us, but we don't always feel like that is the case.
[2159.60 → 2172.60] But according to Romans 5, the three realities of our justification, there are these three, excuse me, three gifts that God gives us to enjoy him, are these three gifts.
[2172.60 → 2178.60] They are peace with God, access to grace, and the hope of glory.
[2178.60 → 2187.60] And Paul is going to insist that these things are true, even if you can't see them in your life all the time.
[2187.60 → 2189.60] But they are objective realities.
[2189.60 → 2197.60] It may not look like a downhill, but God's salvation, just like gravity, doesn't lie.
[2197.60 → 2204.60] And so what I want to do this morning is look at each of these three realities, each of these gifts.
[2204.60 → 2215.60] And then I want to consider why it might not always appear that these things are true, especially when we face suffering in life or trials.
[2215.60 → 2226.60] So first, this kind of part one, let's look at these three realities that come from, as a result of, our justification before God.
[2226.60 → 2233.60] And starting in verse one, Paul sort of summarizes all chapters one through four.
[2233.60 → 2237.60] So if you've been here over the last few months, and you're like, what was all that about?
[2237.60 → 2238.60] This is it.
[2238.60 → 2239.60] This is it.
[2239.60 → 2240.60] Remember this.
[2240.60 → 2247.60] Therefore, he says, since we have been justified through faith.
[2247.60 → 2252.60] That's what Paul has been talking about for four chapters, beginning here in chapter five, all the way through chapter eight.
[2252.60 → 2254.60] He's moving on to a new section.
[2254.60 → 2261.60] And he says, therefore, because of all that I have said, since we have been justified through faith.
[2261.60 → 2274.60] So since God is in the business of taking sinful men, women, and children and making them righteous, giving them his righteousness, because of that, something is going to happen.
[2274.60 → 2283.60] And so what happens to these people, to us Christians who have been justified by faith?
[2283.60 → 2284.60] What happens?
[2284.60 → 2291.60] Because the first reality of our justification is peace with God.
[2291.60 → 2293.60] Okay, peace with God.
[2293.60 → 2307.60] And we see here again, verse one, therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2307.60 → 2314.60] Now, notice that Paul doesn't say we get the peace of God.
[2314.60 → 2317.60] He says that we have peace with God.
[2317.60 → 2318.60] Now, what's the difference?
[2318.60 → 2319.60] Why does that matter?
[2319.60 → 2321.60] Well, what is the peace of God?
[2321.60 → 2331.60] The peace of God, you might consider it kind of like this calm, settled feeling that does come from having God in your life.
[2331.60 → 2339.60] So it's kind of this peacefulness in our hearts and our insides, even in the face of difficulties and trials and challenges in life.
[2339.60 → 2344.60] That is the peace of God in other places in the New Testament.
[2344.60 → 2345.60] Talk about that.
[2345.60 → 2348.60] But that's not what Paul is talking about here.
[2348.60 → 2352.60] Rather, he says the justified person gets peace with God.
[2352.60 → 2354.60] So what does that mean?
[2354.60 → 2356.60] What does it mean, that peace with God?
[2356.60 → 2357.60] Well, imagine this.
[2357.60 → 2361.60] There are lots of ways to talk about or imagine our salvation.
[2361.60 → 2362.60] But here's one.
[2362.60 → 2371.60] Imagine that you are here, God is there, and there is an impenetrable wall between you and God.
[2371.60 → 2377.60] That no human being can break through to get to God.
[2377.60 → 2380.60] It's impossible to break through that wall.
[2380.60 → 2392.60] And the only way then that you can have any sort of loving communion, any grace or any goodness from the God of heaven and earth, is if that wall is broken down.
[2392.60 → 2400.60] And what God has done through Jesus Christ is he has come and broken down that wall that exists because of our sin.
[2400.60 → 2403.60] And he makes peace with God possible.
[2403.60 → 2415.60] Which means, if you are not a Christian, right, if you are not yet justified by faith, then you don't have peace with God.
[2415.60 → 2419.60] You are at war with God.
[2419.60 → 2422.60] There's a wall separating you from him.
[2422.60 → 2423.60] And so, you know what?
[2423.60 → 2432.60] God is in his grace, in his love, he's reaching out his hands to all of humanity and saying that he has provided salvation through a saviour.
[2432.60 → 2440.60] And not only that, he rains down the rain, the sun on the good and the evil alike.
[2440.60 → 2444.60] He gives us all these wonderful things that come from his world.
[2444.60 → 2451.60] And yet, humanity, in our natural state of sin, we choose to go our own way.
[2451.60 → 2455.60] And we take what God has given to us, and we don't give thanks to him.
[2455.60 → 2456.60] We don't honour him.
[2456.60 → 2458.60] We don't acknowledge him.
[2458.60 → 2459.60] We do evil.
[2459.60 → 2460.60] We do evil.
[2460.60 → 2466.60] And as a result of all of that, God says we are at war with him.
[2466.60 → 2481.60] Now, if you think back to your life before you became a Christian, if that's your story, or maybe if you go ask a non-Christian friend in your life, they may say it doesn't feel to them that they are at war with God.
[2481.60 → 2482.60] Right?
[2482.60 → 2486.60] Now, some people, yeah, some people feel at war with God.
[2486.60 → 2488.60] Some people shake their fists at God.
[2488.60 → 2493.60] But most people, they're just kind of indifferent.
[2493.60 → 2494.60] Right?
[2494.60 → 2495.60] Right?
[2495.60 → 2500.60] That God simply doesn't really register that much in their day-to-day lives.
[2500.60 → 2503.60] You know, maybe on Sundays, they play sports.
[2503.60 → 2505.60] They do chores around the house.
[2505.60 → 2507.60] God is far from their thoughts.
[2507.60 → 2521.60] But Paul in the scriptures insists that no matter how it feels, the objective reality is that if you are apart from Christ, there is enmity between you and God.
[2521.60 → 2526.60] And friends, let me just say very quickly here that that is something to take very seriously.
[2526.60 → 2527.60] Right?
[2527.60 → 2532.60] It is a very spiritually dangerous thing to be at war with God.
[2532.60 → 2543.60] But the good news of the gospel is that God has already done everything to make peace with him possible through Jesus Christ.
[2543.60 → 2545.60] He makes a way for peace.
[2545.60 → 2546.60] We don't have to break through that wall.
[2546.60 → 2551.60] And through that wall, God has torn down that wall in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[2551.60 → 2553.60] And we simply receive that.
[2553.60 → 2564.60] And so when a person receives that peace, accepts Christ when they've been justified by faith, then Paul says the relationship with God has been restored.
[2564.60 → 2565.60] Right?
[2565.60 → 2569.60] A peace treaty has been signed by what Christ has done.
[2569.60 → 2572.60] And so we have peace with God.
[2572.60 → 2577.60] And having peace with God is a reality now of our justification.
[2577.60 → 2582.60] Even if it doesn't feel like it's true when we look at our lives and our circumstances.
[2582.60 → 2586.60] Sometimes we look at life, and we're like, well, it doesn't feel like there's peace with God.
[2586.60 → 2590.60] What, you know, my wife, my life maybe feels like a war zone.
[2590.60 → 2604.60] So as a little illustration of this, on May 8th, 1945, Field Marshal Wilhelm Kitten, I don't know German, something like that.
[2604.60 → 2611.60] He signed this unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany to the allies in Britain.
[2611.60 → 2616.60] And we call it VE Day, right? Victory in Europe Day.
[2616.60 → 2621.60] And upon signing of that document, the war was officially over.
[2621.60 → 2624.60] At least as it pertained to the European theatre.
[2624.60 → 2626.60] Peace was established.
[2626.60 → 2628.60] And of course, everyone celebrated, right?
[2628.60 → 2629.60] There were parades.
[2629.60 → 2635.60] There were parties in the street, dancing, bonfires, fireworks, music.
[2635.60 → 2640.60] Winston Churchill gave a radio address and on and on.
[2640.60 → 2643.60] Peace was formally established.
[2643.60 → 2652.60] But if you were living, say in France or in Belgium or in Germany, on May 9th, the day after that treaty was signed,
[2652.60 → 2658.60] you may say, well, it doesn't quite feel like the war is over.
[2658.60 → 2659.60] Right?
[2659.60 → 2660.60] Maybe there were still pockets of fighting.
[2660.60 → 2662.60] Maybe not everyone had heard the news.
[2662.60 → 2665.60] It doesn't feel like peace is established.
[2665.60 → 2677.60] And in some senses, Europe, the rest of the world had to grow in to that peace that was signed.
[2677.60 → 2684.60] But no matter the feeling on the ground, peace was objectively true.
[2684.60 → 2690.60] And similarly, as Christians, we may not sense peace with God all the time in our lives.
[2690.60 → 2697.60] We may still feel inner skirmishes with sin or doubt or temptation.
[2697.60 → 2703.60] But God through His word is assuring us, you do have peace with God.
[2703.60 → 2708.60] No matter how you feel right now, if you are a Christian, God has no case against you.
[2708.60 → 2710.60] You are declared righteous.
[2710.60 → 2712.60] You have peace with God.
[2712.60 → 2713.60] There is peace.
[2713.60 → 2726.60] And hopefully, as time goes on, that objective reality of peace with God will subjectively feel more and more true for each one of us.
[2726.60 → 2736.60] But it is important to note, in New Testament theology, the objective reality always comes before the subjective feeling.
[2736.60 → 2739.60] So that's peace with God.
[2739.60 → 2740.60] That's the first reality.
[2740.60 → 2745.60] The second reality is that we have access to grace.
[2745.60 → 2748.60] So Paul continues in verse 2.
[2748.60 → 2758.60] Through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[2758.60 → 2762.60] Now, what does it mean to gain access?
[2762.60 → 2764.60] That's the key verb here.
[2764.60 → 2770.60] Well, like our English word, when you gain access to something, it kind of means like a formal introduction.
[2770.60 → 2780.60] It means that we now come into the presence chamber of the King of Heaven and Earth.
[2780.60 → 2784.60] And I've used this illustration before, I think a couple of years ago.
[2784.60 → 2785.60] But here is this image.
[2785.60 → 2789.60] It's one of the most iconic images of the White House.
[2789.60 → 2795.60] And it's of little, you can see the boy under the table, little JFK Jr. in the Oval Office.
[2795.60 → 2802.60] His father is the president, arguably one of the most important and powerful men in the entire world.
[2802.60 → 2805.60] And there's this little kid just hanging out with dad.
[2805.60 → 2808.60] And this is what Paul is talking about.
[2808.60 → 2811.60] You have gained access.
[2811.60 → 2812.60] Right?
[2812.60 → 2817.60] Our Lord Jesus Christ is able to bring you into God's presence.
[2817.60 → 2820.60] To announce your name before the Father.
[2820.60 → 2823.60] And your father doesn't just allow you to come in.
[2823.60 → 2824.60] He welcomes you.
[2824.60 → 2826.60] You belong with him.
[2826.60 → 2834.60] And this access to grace, to the presence of God, it takes us far beyond just merely having peace.
[2834.60 → 2835.60] Right?
[2835.60 → 2841.60] So Paul is emphasizing for us, if you are a Christian, not only are you not at war with God anymore,
[2841.60 → 2845.60] but you actually have intimate access to God.
[2845.60 → 2851.60] You know, it's one thing in our experience, it's one thing to stop fighting with someone.
[2851.60 → 2856.60] It's a wholly different thing to then become friends.
[2856.60 → 2858.60] Or to become family.
[2858.60 → 2859.60] Or to belong.
[2859.60 → 2866.60] And it's interesting to note that the verb here, gain access, it's in the perfect tense.
[2866.60 → 2870.60] Well that just means that this is something we already, we always have.
[2870.60 → 2871.60] Right?
[2871.60 → 2876.60] It means that there is no point in which this grace in which we stand is going to be broken,
[2876.60 → 2879.60] or fall apart, or be lost.
[2879.60 → 2884.60] There's no point where we have to wonder, when is the party over?
[2884.60 → 2887.60] Or when do I have to leave God's presence?
[2887.60 → 2889.60] When am I going to maybe get kicked out?
[2889.60 → 2890.60] Right?
[2890.60 → 2894.60] No, we have perpetual access to the Father.
[2894.60 → 2899.60] From the moment you become a Christian, into eternity.
[2899.60 → 2903.60] Because you have been granted access by the Son.
[2903.60 → 2909.60] And again, this is maybe an objective reality that we all don't always feel is true.
[2909.60 → 2910.60] Right?
[2910.60 → 2915.60] As a Christian, sometimes we feel like we are maybe somewhere we don't really belong.
[2915.60 → 2922.60] Maybe like we are at a dinner party, and something like that, and maybe we feel kind of out of place.
[2922.60 → 2930.60] But we are assured, on the basis of what Christ has done, that we now have access into grace.
[2930.60 → 2934.60] Into the presence of God.
[2934.60 → 2939.60] So then as we continue on, we have the third reality of our justification.
[2939.60 → 2941.60] And that is the hope of glory.
[2941.60 → 2945.60] And so we read in verse 2 there,
[2945.60 → 2950.60] And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
[2950.60 → 2953.60] So notice that word, boast.
[2953.60 → 2957.60] If you remember, earlier at the end of chapter 3, Paul said,
[2957.60 → 2959.60] Boasting is excluded.
[2959.60 → 2960.60] No boasting.
[2960.60 → 2965.60] In so far as us boasting in our own works.
[2965.60 → 2966.60] Before God.
[2966.60 → 2967.60] Before God.
[2967.60 → 2972.60] Paul says boasting is excluded because we are justified by faith alone.
[2972.60 → 2979.60] But having received that salvation through Christ, we are now proud to be Christians.
[2979.60 → 2980.60] Right?
[2980.60 → 2985.60] You are now proud to come into the presence of God, where you can never be moved.
[2985.60 → 2986.60] You boast.
[2986.60 → 2987.60] You boast.
[2987.60 → 2991.60] You exult in that.
[2991.60 → 2998.60] Because he has saved you, there is now this future promise also, that you are going to share in the glory of God.
[2998.60 → 3005.60] And so the hope of the Christian life, that great confidence, the great expectation that we all have,
[3005.60 → 3009.60] is that one day we will enjoy God's glory.
[3009.60 → 3017.60] Okay, so those are the three wonderful realities of having been justified by faith that Paul talks about here.
[3017.60 → 3026.60] We have these three gifts of peace with God and access into grace in the hope of the glory of God.
[3026.60 → 3034.60] Now there is something I don't want you to miss, which is that notice how these three realities of justification,
[3034.60 → 3041.60] they kind of correspond to the past, the present, and the future of the Christian life.
[3041.60 → 3042.60] Right?
[3042.60 → 3050.60] So we have peace with God, maybe declared in the past when we become a Christian, when we first believe.
[3050.60 → 3059.60] And then now in the present, we stand in grace, we have access, and in the future, we will fully share in the glory of God.
[3059.60 → 3070.60] And so it's this idea, this salvation that is kind of coursing and flowing through space and time to save you, to save past you, and present you, and future you.
[3072.60 → 3078.60] This gravity of God's grace pulling us closer and closer to him.
[3078.60 → 3085.60] But again, Paul knows that it might not always feel that way.
[3085.60 → 3099.60] And so now what he does is he does this interesting turn where he applies these realities to how the Christian can face suffering.
[3099.60 → 3102.60] Okay, based on all this, what does that mean for us?
[3102.60 → 3104.60] Paul gets very practical.
[3104.60 → 3106.60] How can now we face suffering?
[3106.60 → 3115.60] Because, you know, in the ancient world, ancient philosophies, this was a big question that people had to wrestle with on their daily basis.
[3115.60 → 3118.60] And they were the Stoics, they were the Epicureans, they were all these different philosophies.
[3118.60 → 3121.60] Basically, how do you deal with suffering from life?
[3121.60 → 3124.60] And then you get things like Greek mythology, right?
[3124.60 → 3129.60] Where if you suffer, it's usually because the gods are mad at you.
[3129.60 → 3137.60] And in the ancient world where Paul was writing in Rome, that was the live reality of people's lives.
[3137.60 → 3145.60] Worshipping the gods, offering their sacrifices, offering devotion to all of these different gods, so that the gods wouldn't be mad at you.
[3145.60 → 3164.60] And if you've ever read Homer's Odyssey, for instance, almost the entire narrative, the entire story is based on Odysseus not being able to return home because he's angered the sea god Poseidon.
[3164.60 → 3173.60] And so much of the story, Poseidon is like wrecking Odysseus' ship, he's doing all kinds of things that cause suffering to him because of something Odysseus did.
[3173.60 → 3178.60] He's suffering because he's made the gods angry.
[3178.60 → 3183.60] Now, all of these changes when you get to Christianity.
[3183.60 → 3184.60] Right?
[3184.60 → 3193.60] When Christianity shows up on the scene in history, it presents a completely different way to view suffering.
[3193.60 → 3202.60] In Christianity, for the first time, suffering actually becomes not just something that happens to you because the gods are mad.
[3202.60 → 3205.60] Suffering becomes a means of blessing.
[3205.60 → 3206.60] Okay?
[3206.60 → 3209.60] And this is radically different.
[3209.60 → 3214.60] And we see that reality here in verse 3 in our passage.
[3214.60 → 3223.60] Where Paul goes on and says, not only so, all this he's just said, but we also glory in our sufferings.
[3223.60 → 3228.60] Now, honestly, that's a really strange thing to say.
[3228.60 → 3229.60] Right?
[3229.60 → 3230.60] Wouldn't you agree?
[3230.60 → 3237.60] I mean, we could agree that, yes, we should rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[3237.60 → 3238.60] That's something to celebrate.
[3238.60 → 3240.60] That's something to be joyful in.
[3240.60 → 3246.60] That one day we will experience God's glory in all of its fullest intensity.
[3246.60 → 3252.60] But how can Paul possibly say that we rejoice in suffering?
[3252.60 → 3256.60] Well, let me say this.
[3256.60 → 3281.60] The only way this makes sense, that we would rejoice in suffering, is if somehow God is able to use our suffering to move us forward in experiencing and enjoying his peace and his presence and his glory.
[3281.60 → 3290.60] If he's able to use our suffering to move us further up and further in with our life in God, then that is something that would cause us to rejoice.
[3290.60 → 3294.60] And that is exactly what God does in our suffering.
[3294.60 → 3301.60] We rejoice in the midst of suffering because we are able to look beyond suffering to what God is doing in us.
[3301.60 → 3304.60] And so let's see how Paul talks about that.
[3304.60 → 3308.60] Verse 3 continues, we also glory in our suffering.
[3308.60 → 3309.60] Why?
[3309.60 → 3314.60] Because we know that suffering produces perseverance.
[3314.60 → 3317.60] Perseverance, character, and character, hope.
[3317.60 → 3325.60] And so Paul talks about this chain reaction that gets set into motion when we face suffering.
[3325.60 → 3332.60] And the first thing that happens is that suffering produces perseverance.
[3332.60 → 3348.60] Now, those of you who understand something about running, and I think of Ryan in particular, you'll know that perseverance or endurance is not just something that you start off with.
[3348.60 → 3351.60] Like, all of us don't just have endurance to be runners.
[3351.60 → 3354.60] It's actually quite difficult to get.
[3354.60 → 3359.60] And so what is the best way to start off as a runner?
[3359.60 → 3368.60] Well, if you talk to Ryan, or maybe you read, you know, Runner's World or something, they'll tell you to get started as a runner, you actually start by walking.
[3368.60 → 3372.60] Especially if you are completely inactive, like some of us.
[3372.60 → 3377.60] Okay, you don't just start running until you've been walking for like four weeks.
[3377.60 → 3380.60] And then maybe you start running like five minutes a day.
[3380.60 → 3381.60] That's it.
[3381.60 → 3383.60] Five minutes.
[3383.60 → 3388.60] Because what happens is stress fractures are the most common injury.
[3388.60 → 3391.60] Where people will say, okay, I need to start running, I need to get in shape.
[3391.60 → 3394.60] They start running, and the body falls apart.
[3394.60 → 3403.60] It can take several months to get to the point where you can just go out there and run for some distance or for some time.
[3403.60 → 3407.60] Because endurance takes time to achieve.
[3407.60 → 3408.60] Right?
[3408.60 → 3410.60] It's not something that we all just have.
[3410.60 → 3414.60] And similarly, you don't say, oh, I'm a Christian now.
[3414.60 → 3415.60] I have endurance.
[3415.60 → 3418.60] No, you are justified.
[3418.60 → 3420.60] That doesn't mean you have endurance.
[3420.60 → 3424.60] So how do we build endurance as a Christian?
[3424.60 → 3426.60] Well, you have to suffer.
[3426.60 → 3430.60] Just like learning to run is kind of pain and suffering.
[3430.60 → 3436.60] The Christian life, through suffering, God produces endurance in your life.
[3436.60 → 3438.60] And why is that so important?
[3438.60 → 3441.60] Because endurance produces what?
[3441.60 → 3442.60] Character.
[3442.60 → 3444.60] What is character?
[3444.60 → 3449.60] A person with character is someone who has suffered and has come through it.
[3449.60 → 3453.60] Who has endured through that suffering.
[3453.60 → 3456.60] It's this quality of being tested.
[3456.60 → 3459.60] And having grown in virtue.
[3459.60 → 3463.60] And having grown in Christ-likeness as a result of that suffering.
[3463.60 → 3468.60] I mean, think about someone who has never suffered.
[3468.60 → 3471.60] They're kind of annoying.
[3471.60 → 3473.60] They're not very, like, mature.
[3473.60 → 3475.60] They're very self-focused.
[3475.60 → 3479.60] Think about a person you know who has suffered.
[3479.60 → 3482.60] And they have walked with God through their suffering.
[3482.60 → 3483.60] Maybe for years.
[3483.60 → 3484.60] Maybe for decades.
[3484.60 → 3486.60] Through all kinds of various trials.
[3486.60 → 3490.60] And they become more and more beautiful.
[3490.60 → 3492.60] As a result of that.
[3492.60 → 3493.60] Right?
[3493.60 → 3494.60] They become humbler.
[3494.60 → 3496.60] They're able to care for others.
[3496.60 → 3498.60] They are wise.
[3498.60 → 3500.60] They've grown closer to the Lord.
[3500.60 → 3501.60] They become more godly.
[3501.60 → 3503.60] Through it all.
[3503.60 → 3507.60] That is the character that God produces in us through suffering.
[3507.60 → 3513.60] And the final part of this chain reaction, Paul says, is hope.
[3513.60 → 3514.60] Right?
[3514.60 → 3517.60] So a person who has endured through suffering.
[3517.60 → 3519.60] Who has persevered through it.
[3519.60 → 3521.60] Who has been healed from it.
[3521.60 → 3523.60] Who has grown in character.
[3523.60 → 3526.60] They know that God will be with them.
[3526.60 → 3528.60] No matter what.
[3528.60 → 3530.60] And so they have hope.
[3530.60 → 3534.60] They see that the character that God is producing in them.
[3534.60 → 3538.60] That they are on the path of the Christian life.
[3538.60 → 3541.60] And they grow in hope.
[3541.60 → 3545.60] Now, I want to be very clear about something though.
[3545.60 → 3549.60] Which is that Paul is not saying that suffering is a good thing.
[3549.60 → 3551.60] Paul is not saying that.
[3551.60 → 3555.60] He is not saying we should rejoice because of suffering.
[3555.60 → 3556.60] Right?
[3556.60 → 3558.60] Suffering came into the world through sin.
[3558.60 → 3561.60] And one day God will destroy it.
[3561.60 → 3562.60] Okay?
[3562.60 → 3565.60] So we don't rejoice because of suffering.
[3565.60 → 3568.60] Like, oh, my boyfriend broke up with me.
[3568.60 → 3569.60] Awesome.
[3569.60 → 3570.60] No.
[3570.60 → 3576.60] But what Paul is saying is that God, in his power and in his mercy,
[3576.60 → 3580.60] one of the ways that he triumphs over our suffering,
[3580.60 → 3583.60] right now in our lives, is that he works through it.
[3583.60 → 3587.60] And he can redeem our suffering to drive us to himself.
[3587.60 → 3592.60] To strip away anything else that we are trusting in that is not him alone.
[3592.60 → 3598.60] And to focus our attention and our hearts on our hope in him.
[3598.60 → 3610.60] And he uses our suffering in this way to help us truly feel and know and experience and enjoy the reality of grace.
[3610.60 → 3612.60] The reality of our justification.
[3612.60 → 3621.60] And so, I know that some of you here this morning are suffering.
[3621.60 → 3623.60] Right?
[3623.60 → 3625.60] There is something going on in your life.
[3625.60 → 3626.60] All kinds of different things.
[3626.60 → 3627.60] It could be.
[3627.60 → 3628.60] That are very hard.
[3628.60 → 3636.60] And what I would encourage you is to say this morning is to lean into this chain reaction that Paul is talking about.
[3636.60 → 3644.60] Margaret Atwood, the author, Canadian author I believe.
[3644.60 → 3649.60] She has this great quote about going through hard times.
[3649.60 → 3651.60] This is what she wrote.
[3651.60 → 3652.60] She said,
[3652.60 → 3658.60] When you are in the middle of a story, it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion.
[3658.60 → 3659.60] A dark roaring.
[3659.60 → 3660.60] A blindness.
[3660.60 → 3664.60] A wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood.
[3664.60 → 3669.60] It's only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all.
[3671.60 → 3675.60] And when you are suffering, it's often that you can't see what God is doing.
[3675.60 → 3676.60] Right?
[3676.60 → 3679.60] We suffer like everything is splintered glass, broken wood.
[3679.60 → 3680.60] We are blind.
[3680.60 → 3681.60] We are confused.
[3681.60 → 3684.60] We can't see what is happening.
[3684.60 → 3693.60] But the scriptures, this passage comes along, and it reminds us that when you are suffering, God is doing something in your life.
[3693.60 → 3695.60] He is not mad at you.
[3695.60 → 3698.60] Not like the gods of the Greco-Romans.
[3698.60 → 3702.60] But you are learning to persevere.
[3702.60 → 3708.60] God is producing character in you, and you are becoming a different you.
[3708.60 → 3715.60] And then you can look through your suffering to what God will do through it to sanctify us.
[3715.60 → 3720.60] And we know the end of the story because we have the hope of glory.
[3720.60 → 3733.60] And so we know that God redeems the suffering, and he works through suffering because the whole basis of the Christian life is that God has accomplished our salvation through the suffering of his son.
[3733.60 → 3734.60] God suffered.
[3734.60 → 3735.60] God suffered.
[3735.60 → 3740.60] Jesus came, he entered into our suffering.
[3740.60 → 3742.60] He died on the cross.
[3742.60 → 3747.60] He rose again from the dead in order that he could give us peace with God.
[3747.60 → 3750.60] And that he could give us access into God's presence.
[3750.60 → 3752.60] And that he could give us the hope of glory.
[3752.60 → 3763.60] And even if we cannot feel those realities, we can know they are true when we look at Jesus.
[3763.60 → 3765.60] And how he died for you.
[3765.60 → 3767.60] And how he rose again.
[3767.60 → 3769.60] So let's pray.
[3769.60 → 3781.60] Oh Lord, we thank you for your word that comes into the realities of our lives, and it reminds us of what is true.
[3781.60 → 3783.60] Even when we can't feel it.
[3783.60 → 3784.60] Even when we can't feel it.
[3784.60 → 3795.60] And we thank you that you have not just justified us, but that you have justified us in such a way that we have a longing now to want to be with you and not just run away from you.
[3795.60 → 3803.60] And thank you for what you have done on our behalf to transform us and to change us.
[3803.60 → 3814.60] And Lord, as we face suffering in life, would you redeem our suffering to draw us more closely to you through our Lord Jesus Christ in whose name we pray.
[3814.60 → 3815.60] Amen.
[3815.60 → 3824.60] Let's all stand and let's sing in response to God's word.
[3824.60 → 3825.60] God's word.
[3825.60 → 3826.60] Amen.
[3826.60 → 3827.60] Thank you.
[3827.60 → 3828.60] Amen.
[3857.60 → 3859.60] Amen.
[3887.60 → 3889.60] Amen.
[3917.60 → 3919.60] Amen.
[3947.60 → 3949.60] Amen.
[3977.60 → 3979.60] Amen.
[4007.60 → 4009.60] Amen.
[4037.60 → 4039.60] Amen.
[4059.58 → 4060.16] Amen.
[4060.16 → 4065.76] We continue our worship this morning by coming now to give our tithes and offerings.
[4065.76 → 4072.88] and being reminded that everything we have ultimately belongs to God.
[4073.34 → 4079.56] And we are just giving back as an expression of our worship and of our wonder of him.
[4080.26 → 4084.84] Our designated offering today is for our denominational ministries.
[4085.62 → 4090.22] You know, we're part of a denomination that has many different organizations that are part of it
[4090.22 → 4094.02] for spreading the gospel both here in Canada and around the world.
[4094.02 → 4098.50] And so may I invite our deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[4124.02 → 4130.02] You know, we're also a part of a sanitarian idea for Semitism here today.
[4130.30 → 4135.62] And so our content is to bring back the opportunity to establish a饬都市,
[4135.68 → 4141.12] and to be included with community support to collect Theresa victories.
[4141.78 → 4144.90] Our thank you to all you, for the invitation is best to see thirteen,
[4145.02 → 4146.98] reel turning out loud today into our presentation,
[4146.98 → 4176.96] Thank you.
[4176.98 → 4206.96] Thank you.
[4206.98 → 4236.96] Thank you.
[4236.98 → 4238.98] Thank you.
[4266.98 → 4268.98] Thank you.
[4268.98 → 4270.98] Thank you.
[4270.98 → 4272.74] We'll lift that up in prayer as well.
[4273.44 → 4274.20] Let's pray.
[4274.20 → 4276.20] Thank you.
[4276.20 → 4306.20] 
[4306.20 → 4308.20] Thank you.
[4308.20 → 4310.20] Thank you.
[4310.20 → 4312.20] Thank you.
[4312.20 → 4314.20] Thank you.
[4314.20 → 4316.20] Thank you.
[4316.20 → 4318.20] Thank you.
[4318.20 → 4320.20] Thank you.
[4320.20 → 4322.20] Thank you.
[4322.20 → 4324.20] Thank you.
[4324.20 → 4326.20] Thank you.
[4326.20 → 4328.20] Thank you.
[4328.20 → 4330.20] Thank you.
[4330.20 → 4332.20] Thank you.
[4332.20 → 4334.20] Thank you.
[4334.20 → 4336.20] Thank you.
[4336.20 → 4338.20] Thank you.
[4338.20 → 4340.20] Thank you.
[4340.20 → 4342.20] Thank you.
[4342.20 → 4348.00] world that needs your healing in so many different ways. We pray, Lord, that peace would prevail on
[4348.00 → 4357.70] earth so that the gospel might go forward and that your kingdom would come. Lord, we pray for your
[4357.70 → 4363.52] church around the globe. We pray for many seeds of the gospel to be planted in the hearts of men,
[4363.52 → 4370.56] women, and children. Lord, we thank you that those new missionaries we support, Alex and Nicole,
[4370.56 → 4377.12] that they were granted their visas to move to that new country that you have called them to. We pray
[4377.12 → 4382.32] that you would help them to settle into a new place, that you'd help them to learn a new language
[4382.32 → 4389.16] and a new culture, that you would equip them to share the whole counsel of God with the people
[4389.98 → 4397.06] that you have called them to. Lord, we also pray for the work of our denomination. We pray that you
[4397.06 → 4404.84] would continue to use the Christian Reformed Church here in BC and in Canada and in the United States
[4404.84 → 4411.10] and around the world to proclaim your gospel so that many will come to know of your great salvation,
[4411.10 → 4418.64] O Lord. Lord, help us, your church, to be proclaimers of your gospel and to be witnesses
[4418.64 → 4427.72] of your kingdom in all of its multifaceted ways. Lord, we pray we lift to you our class this
[4427.72 → 4433.76] meeting next week. Lord, we ask that you would knit us together as churches in BC Southeast,
[4434.60 → 4440.64] knit us together as a group of churches in cooperation and in partnership by your spirit.
[4440.64 → 4445.50] And we ask by the power of your spirit that you would fill us with the knowledge of your will
[4445.50 → 4452.20] and grant to us spiritual wisdom and understanding beyond our own capabilities.
[4454.28 → 4460.96] Lord, we remember before you our dear sister in Christ, Connie Graham. Lord, we thank you for her life.
[4461.90 → 4468.24] We thank you for all that she has meant to us over the years being part of our church family,
[4468.24 → 4477.86] always with, Lord, a warm smile and a kind word. And we thank you for her strong faith in you.
[4479.12 → 4488.02] We thank you, Lord, for the hope of glory that she felt secure in your arms. Lord, we pray that you
[4488.02 → 4496.00] would comfort and be with and near her daughter, her son, other family members, and also us, her church family.
[4496.00 → 4506.36] Lord, we continue to pray for also the family and friends of Grace Krista, who also now is with you in glory.
[4507.48 → 4513.02] We pray, Lord, also for those who need your healing. We especially this morning pray, Lord, for Michael Wayne,
[4513.62 → 4522.66] who was diagnosed with a form of cancer, who is in the hospital, but Lord, now he is out,
[4522.66 → 4530.50] but still going through treatments and in care. Lord, would you bring healing to him? Lord, would you
[4530.50 → 4539.50] extend his life in the days that you have in store for him? And Lord, would he know of your hand upon him,
[4539.90 → 4546.50] upon his body? Lord, but we also don't, we don't only come before you with our needs,
[4546.50 → 4552.48] but we come before you with rejoicing for what you have done. And we, this morning, we thank you,
[4552.54 → 4561.36] we praise you for 65 years of marriage for John and Kathy. Lord, you've been with them in the ups and
[4561.36 → 4569.44] downs of marriage that we all experience, and you have helped them in to endure. You've built them in
[4569.44 → 4578.08] character, and Lord, we trust also that they have, even now more than ever, a greater hope of the glory
[4578.08 → 4586.08] of God. Lord, we celebrate with them. We celebrate your faithfulness in their lives. And we ask these
[4586.08 → 4592.84] things, Jesus, because you said we could, to come before you with all of our prayers. And finally,
[4592.84 → 4599.76] Father, we pray that you would cause us to dwell deeply with Jesus by faith. Let us be rooted and
[4599.76 → 4606.96] grounded in the love that is yours, Father, through the Holy Spirit. We pray all these things in Jesus'
[4607.16 → 4618.12] name and for his sake. Amen. Let's all stand and again, join us for a cake and coffee to meet one
[4618.12 → 4623.64] another, fellowship with one another, in the fellowship hall there. And I invite you to hold
[4623.64 → 4630.08] out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing. Now may the God of peace, who through
[4630.08 → 4635.10] the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that great shepherd
[4635.10 → 4641.78] of the sheep, and may he equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us that
[4641.78 → 4648.62] which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory now and forever. Amen.
[4649.58 → 4653.10] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song this morning.
[4671.78 → 4699.46] Lord, let your life, and of your face, shine on us. Lord, let your life, and of your face, shine on us.
[4699.46 → 4729.44] Lord, let your life, and of your face, shine on us.
[4729.46 → 4734.46] Lord, let your grace, and of your face, shine on us. Lord, let your grace, grace
[4734.46 → 4745.20] from your hand, come on us. Lord, let your grace, and of your face, shine on us. Lord,
[4745.20 → 4754.02] let your grace, grace from your hand, come on us. Lord, let your grace, and of your face, shine on us.
[4754.02 → 4760.92] That we may be safe
[4760.92 → 4767.10] That we may abide
[4767.10 → 4774.26] To find our way in the darkest night
[4774.26 → 4780.38] Let your grace fall on earth
[4784.02 → 4789.90] Lord, let your love
[4789.90 → 4793.30] Love with no end
[4793.30 → 4797.42] Come over us
[4797.42 → 4802.94] Lord, let your love
[4802.94 → 4806.22] Love with no end
[4806.22 → 4809.74] Come over us
[4809.74 → 4816.40] That we may be safe
[4816.40 → 4822.54] That we may have light
[4822.54 → 4829.56] To find our way in the darkest night
[4829.56 → 4836.22] Let your love come over us
[4836.22 → 4843.72] Let your love shine on us
[4843.72 → 4865.96] Lord, let your love
[4865.96 → 4895.94] Thank you.
[4895.96 → 4925.94] Thank you.
[4925.96 → 4927.96] Thank you.
