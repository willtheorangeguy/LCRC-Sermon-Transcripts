[360.00 --> 360.98]  Amen.
[364.80 --> 365.98]  Good morning, everyone.
[367.38 --> 369.46]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reform Church.
[369.54 --> 370.88]  It's great to see you all again.
[370.88 --> 375.32]  As many of you will know, I've been away for kind of an extended summer holiday.
[375.88 --> 381.30]  My family and I, we went back to the East Coast and saw a family whom we haven't seen in quite a while.
[381.92 --> 383.40]  And so thank you for your support.
[383.80 --> 385.40]  And it's great to be back with you.
[385.40 --> 390.02]  And so welcome to you as well.
[390.12 --> 396.24]  And if you are new here today or visiting, we are especially glad to see you and that you're with us.
[396.62 --> 400.50]  Of course, it's a long weekend. It's the last hurrah before summer ends.
[400.62 --> 403.36]  So I know a lot of people are away and traveling.
[404.78 --> 410.28]  But we are here this morning together to come before the Lord in worship.
[410.28 --> 418.44]  And before we begin, if you have your bulletin that was handed out, you can find a few announcements.
[418.66 --> 420.28]  And I'll just highlight a couple.
[421.34 --> 429.64]  One is that this Thursday, September 4th, we're starting up the coffee drop-in on Thursday mornings at 10 o'clock.
[430.08 --> 437.62]  And so everyone is welcome to come, grab a cup of coffee, and it's a great time to catch up with each other's lives on Thursday morning.
[437.62 --> 447.88]  Another one, this is very important in my mind, which is that next Sunday, we will be having, celebrating baptisms.
[448.84 --> 453.54]  And some of the, so Pastor Nancy, while I was away, was teaching baptism classes.
[453.98 --> 458.86]  And I believe there's at least five people, if not maybe a couple more, who will be baptized.
[458.86 --> 467.82]  And so next Sunday, we will be at Martin and Ann Heming's house, using the pool for the baptisms.
[468.64 --> 471.92]  And so this will also be a potluck lunch.
[472.40 --> 477.24]  So this just means bring some food that you would even just have for yourself, maybe bring some to share.
[477.66 --> 480.18]  And we will share some lunch.
[480.30 --> 484.94]  We will celebrate the baptisms and have kind of a little picnic next Sunday.
[484.94 --> 486.44]  So please take note of that.
[487.36 --> 489.08]  And that will be right after the worship service.
[489.16 --> 492.08]  We'll go right over to the farm for the baptisms.
[493.26 --> 496.88]  Another announcement is that there is no Sunday school today.
[497.82 --> 502.06]  But I have something for the kids, if there are any kids who came today.
[502.28 --> 502.76]  I don't know.
[502.86 --> 503.34]  But we'll see.
[503.50 --> 505.12]  I got a little coloring sheet I made for them.
[506.24 --> 506.92]  Actually, you know what?
[506.96 --> 508.66]  ChatGPT made the coloring sheet.
[509.84 --> 512.64]  But anyway, I told it to.
[513.36 --> 514.50]  That's how it works these days.
[514.94 --> 522.26]  With that, we begin our worship service every week with the call to worship.
[523.18 --> 530.92]  And it is our conviction that it is not me who is calling us to worship, but it is God himself who calls us to worship.
[531.86 --> 537.92]  And God is going to call us to worship through his word and by his spirit.
[537.92 --> 543.24]  And so in this time of worship, it is God who is at work.
[544.48 --> 552.70]  And God is at work as he gathers his people in, as he causes us to grow up in Christ, to grow to maturity.
[553.12 --> 558.80]  And then as he sends us out to love God and our neighbor and to serve the world.
[558.80 --> 564.66]  So with that in mind, let's hear and let's respond to God's call to worship him today.
[565.00 --> 566.66]  This comes from Psalm 107.
[566.66 --> 573.78]  Oh, give thanks to the Lord for he is good for his steadfast love endures forever.
[573.78 --> 580.28]  Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble together.
[581.10 --> 587.58]  He brought us out of darkness and the shadow of death and burst our bonds apart.
[587.58 --> 594.80]  He satisfies the longing soul and the hungry soul he fills with good things.
[595.40 --> 602.96]  Let us thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man.
[603.38 --> 607.90]  Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration as we come before the Lord in praise.
[607.90 --> 620.30]  Heavenly Father, Lord, our God, creator of heaven and earth, we bow our hearts before you this morning.
[621.02 --> 623.42]  And we praise you, Lord, for your steadfast love.
[624.00 --> 626.60]  A love that is never ending.
[627.34 --> 629.08]  A love that is all pursuing.
[630.04 --> 631.56]  A love that saves us.
[632.56 --> 635.72]  And a love that takes dead things and makes them alive.
[635.72 --> 638.92]  A love that gives strength and courage and faith.
[640.10 --> 645.58]  And Father, would you send your Holy Spirit this morning to open the eyes of our understanding.
[646.06 --> 648.68]  To give us ears to hear the wonders of Christ.
[649.52 --> 652.78]  And Lord, to change us into the image of Jesus our Savior.
[653.48 --> 655.20]  Because that is our greatest need.
[655.92 --> 657.56]  We ask this in Christ's name.
[658.10 --> 658.46]  Amen.
[659.64 --> 662.38]  So let's stand in body or in spirit as you are able.
[662.38 --> 665.74]  Because God greets us this morning with these words.
[667.24 --> 667.54]  It says,
[667.66 --> 673.86]  To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ,
[674.60 --> 679.30]  mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[680.28 --> 684.56]  So as God has called us into his presence to worship, and he has greeted us,
[684.62 --> 685.86]  let's turn and let's greet one another.
[685.86 --> 685.98]  Amen.
[685.98 --> 686.02]  Amen.
[686.02 --> 686.42]  Amen.
[686.42 --> 687.02]  Amen.
[687.02 --> 687.46]  Amen.
[687.46 --> 688.02]  Amen.
[688.02 --> 689.02]  Amen.
[689.02 --> 689.06]  Amen.
[689.06 --> 690.02]  Amen.
[690.02 --> 691.02]  Amen.
[691.02 --> 691.14]  Amen.
[692.38 --> 693.38]  Amen.
[722.38 --> 730.96]  A вроде structures are really, kind of a f сто Ooo,
[730.96 --> 735.16]  a world of windows, but we are calling a hearth of that,
[735.16 --> 736.52]  the Him of wipe of the pust.
[736.52 --> 740.22]  I come to Jesus chair, why amen.
[741.66 --> 748.02]  So be two songs who attribute us to whisk the Dionries singing,
[748.02 --> 749.18]  which are here at left, but we do not mean the most of them as the beautiful,
[749.18 --> 750.18]  these nations light is full of his ideas of hearts to join us all together,
[750.18 --> 751.38]  when we hear our way from foster homes.
[751.38 --> 766.74]  For the glory of the skies, for the love which from our birth over and around us lies,
[766.74 --> 776.86]  first our Lord to you we raise, this our hymn of grateful praise.
[776.86 --> 791.92]  For the joy of human love, brother, sister, parent, child, friends on earth and friends above,
[791.92 --> 806.58]  for all gentle thoughts and mild, Christ our Lord to you we raise, this our hymn of grateful praise.
[806.86 --> 820.92]  For your selfless gift divine, to the world so freely give, agent of God's grand design,
[820.92 --> 835.92]  peace on earth and joy in heaven, Christ our Lord to you we raise, this our hymn of grateful praise.
[835.92 --> 837.92]  Amen.
[837.92 --> 839.92]  Amen.
[839.92 --> 841.92]  Amen.
[841.92 --> 843.92]  Amen.
[843.92 --> 845.92]  Amen.
[845.92 --> 857.92]  Amen.
[857.92 --> 869.92]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain.
[871.26 --> 879.00]  Dip your heart in the stream of life and the pain and the sorrow.
[879.00 --> 888.00]  Be washed away in the whims of his mercy.
[888.00 --> 902.00]  As deep prides us too deep, we sing, Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[902.00 --> 909.00]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[911.00 --> 917.00]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[919.00 --> 926.00]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[926.00 --> 938.00]  All who are thirsty, all who are weak, come to the fountain.
[939.00 --> 947.00]  Dip your heart in the stream of life and the pain and the sorrow.
[947.00 --> 957.00]  Be washed away in the whims of his mercy.
[958.00 --> 968.00]  As deep prides us too deep, we sing, Holy Spirit, come.
[968.00 --> 977.00]  Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[977.00 --> 986.00]  Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[986.00 --> 992.00]  Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[992.00 --> 993.00]  Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[993.00 --> 1019.00]  As deep prides us too deep, as deep prides us too deep, as deep prides us too deep, we sing, Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[1019.00 --> 1039.00]  Come, Holy Spirit, come.
[1039.00 --> 1044.00]  So our first scripture reading this morning is from Psalm 106.
[1044.00 --> 1047.00]  It's on page 452 in your pew Bible.
[1047.00 --> 1051.00]  Please open with me to Psalm 106.
[1051.00 --> 1055.00]  Give us all a moment to turn there.
[1055.00 --> 1057.00]  Psalm 106.
[1057.00 --> 1061.00]  That's on page 452 in your pew Bible.
[1061.00 --> 1076.00]  And I'll be reading verses 1 through 13, and then I'm going to jump to verse 40 to the end.
[1076.00 --> 1078.00]  Okay, so Psalm 106.
[1078.00 --> 1080.00]  Praise the Lord.
[1080.00 --> 1086.00]  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, his love endures forever.
[1086.00 --> 1091.00]  Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord, or fully declare his praise?
[1091.00 --> 1097.00]  Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.
[1097.00 --> 1100.00]  Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people.
[1100.00 --> 1113.00]  Come to my aid when you save them, that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation, and join your inheritance in giving praise.
[1113.00 --> 1118.00]  We have sinned, even as our fathers did.
[1118.00 --> 1120.00]  We have done wrong and acted wickedly.
[1120.00 --> 1124.00]  When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles.
[1124.00 --> 1130.00]  They did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
[1130.00 --> 1135.00]  Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.
[1135.00 --> 1139.00]  He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up.
[1139.00 --> 1143.00]  He led them through the depths, as through a desert.
[1143.00 --> 1147.00]  He saved them from the hand of the foe, from the hand of the enemy.
[1147.00 --> 1149.00]  He redeemed them.
[1149.00 --> 1151.00]  The waters covered their adversaries.
[1151.00 --> 1153.00]  Not one of them survived.
[1153.00 --> 1157.00]  Then they believed his promises, and sang his praise.
[1157.00 --> 1164.00]  But they soon forgot what he had done, and did not wait for his counsel.
[1164.00 --> 1167.00]  So, jumping forward to verse 40.
[1167.00 --> 1173.00]  Therefore, the Lord was angry with his people, and abhorred his inheritance.
[1173.00 --> 1177.00]  He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
[1177.00 --> 1180.00]  Their enemies oppressed them, and subjected them to their power.
[1180.00 --> 1187.00]  Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion, and they wasted away in their sin.
[1187.00 --> 1195.00]  But as he took note of their distress, when he heard their cry, for their sake he remembered his covenant.
[1195.00 --> 1197.00]  And out of his great love, he relented.
[1197.00 --> 1201.00]  He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.
[1201.00 --> 1211.00]  Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.
[1211.00 --> 1216.00]  Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
[1216.00 --> 1219.00]  Let the people say, Amen.
[1219.00 --> 1220.00]  Amen.
[1220.00 --> 1221.00]  Praise the Lord.
[1221.00 --> 1226.00]  Praise the Lord.
[1226.00 --> 1237.00]  So, the Lord invites us now in this time in our worship service to confess our sins before him, trusting that he meets us with his grace.
[1237.00 --> 1241.00]  So, would you bow your heads with me in a prayer of adoration?
[1241.00 --> 1244.00]  Let's all come before the Lord in prayer.
[1244.00 --> 1257.00]  Holy and merciful God, as we just read in Psalm 106 of the sinful ways in the wayward hearts of your people.
[1257.00 --> 1266.00]  Yet we also read of your steadfast love, your willingness again and again to forgive.
[1266.00 --> 1289.00]  So, Father, as we also reflect and we consider our own lives, we look to our past, and we recall both your great acts of love and kindness and mercy to us, as well as the many moments and situations where we know we failed you and sinned against you and others.
[1289.00 --> 1293.00]  Yet even still, Lord, your love for us remains.
[1293.00 --> 1298.00]  And so, Lord, in humility and brokenness, we pray for your forgiveness.
[1298.00 --> 1304.00]  Would you buy us back from our slavery to ourselves and to our own way?
[1304.00 --> 1308.00]  And would you crown us again with your acceptance and your care?
[1308.00 --> 1312.00]  Would you renew us with the strength that only you can give?
[1312.00 --> 1314.00]  Speights for us again,
[1314.00 --> 1327.00]  Sean?
[1327.00 --> 1335.24]  remove our sins from us because of the life the death the resurrection and the ascension
[1335.24 --> 1341.32]  in the gift of the spirit given to us through our lord jesus christ and it is in his name that we pray
[1341.32 --> 1348.44]  amen and so brothers and sisters the good news of the gospel is that in christ we are forgiven
[1348.44 --> 1356.52]  and god not only leaves us in that place of confession but he then assures us of his mercy
[1356.52 --> 1361.96]  and his acceptance and he gives us words of comfort and assurance so would you receive these words of
[1361.96 --> 1371.32]  assurance from the living god from micah chapter 7 says this who is a god like you who pardons sin
[1371.32 --> 1377.56]  and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance you did not stay angry forever
[1377.56 --> 1383.88]  but delight to show mercy you will again have compassion on us you will tread our sins underfoot
[1383.88 --> 1389.72]  and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea thanks be to god
[1392.04 --> 1407.88]  with that let's all stand and let's sing um some two other songs of god's mercy let's stand together
[1413.88 --> 1418.12]  i
[1418.12 --> 1428.12]  have done. Omnish and ongoing, he counseled us some, thrown into a sea without bottom
[1428.12 --> 1436.12]  or shore. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1436.12 --> 1453.12]  What patience will wait as we constantly roam. What Father so tender is calling us poor.
[1453.12 --> 1465.12]  He welcomes the weakest, the foulest, the poor. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1465.12 --> 1486.12]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor. Stronger than darkness, new every morn. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1486.12 --> 1505.12]  What riches of kindness he lavished on us. His blood was the payment, his life was the cost. We stood need the debt we could never afford.
[1505.12 --> 1510.12]  Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1510.12 --> 1517.12]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor.
[1517.12 --> 1530.12]  Stronger than darkness, new every morn. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1530.12 --> 1540.12]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is poor.
[1540.12 --> 1550.12]  Stronger than darkness, new every morn. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1550.12 --> 1557.12]  Stronger than darkness, new every morn. Our sins, they are many, his mercy is poor.
[1557.12 --> 1566.12]  Our next song for this morning is a new one, A Thousand Halleluias. And if you listen to Spotify, this is one that is sung quite a bit.
[1566.12 --> 1570.12]  And this is one that Pastor Jason said, they sang at Synod and he thought it was very lovely.
[1570.12 --> 1576.12]  And of course, as we've just sung and as we've just heard in our assurance, God has forgiven us.
[1576.12 --> 1581.12]  And that truly is worthy of a thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more.
[1606.12 --> 1607.12]  And that truly is a place where we can see the Lord.
[1607.12 --> 1609.12]  Let us pray with us.
[1609.12 --> 1610.12]  Amen.
[1610.12 --> 1614.12]  Who else would walks cry out to worship?
[1614.12 --> 1615.12]  Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
[1615.12 --> 1618.12]  Perhaps creation longs to heaven's words to sing.
[1618.12 --> 1621.12]  But this joy is mine.
[1621.12 --> 1629.62]  Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
[1629.62 --> 1635.24]  But this joy is mine
[1635.24 --> 1643.66]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1643.66 --> 1650.52]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
[1650.52 --> 1656.80]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1656.80 --> 1663.76]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1663.76 --> 1670.36]  Who else would die for our redemption?
[1672.76 --> 1677.72]  Whose resurrection beats our rise?
[1677.72 --> 1685.00]  There isn't time enough to sing of all you've done
[1685.00 --> 1691.28]  But I have eternity to try
[1691.28 --> 1699.28]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1699.28 --> 1706.08]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
[1706.08 --> 1712.24]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1712.24 --> 1719.52]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1719.52 --> 1736.80]  Praise to the Lord
[1736.80 --> 1744.08]  To the Lamb, to the King of Heaven
[1744.08 --> 1752.80]  Praise for He rose, now He reigns
[1752.80 --> 1757.08]  We will sing forever
[1757.08 --> 1762.08]  Praise to the Lord
[1762.08 --> 1770.22]  To the Lamb, to the King of Heaven
[1770.22 --> 1778.80]  Praise for He rose, now He reigns
[1778.80 --> 1781.08]  We will sing forever
[1781.08 --> 1783.08]  We will sing forever
[1783.08 --> 1791.08]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1791.08 --> 1798.08]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
[1798.08 --> 1804.36]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1804.36 --> 1812.08]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1812.08 --> 1814.36]  Praise to the Lord
[1814.36 --> 1828.36]  Praise to the Lord
[1828.36 --> 1835.36]  To the Lamb, to the King of Heaven
[1835.36 --> 1840.64]  Praise to the King of Heaven
[1840.64 --> 1857.64]  Praise to the King of Heaven
[1857.64 --> 1862.76]  Praise to the King of Heaven
[1862.76 --> 1877.08]  the praise lord jesus this song is forever yours a thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1881.72 --> 1887.08]  you may be seated
[1887.08 --> 1897.64]  i could hear we were getting more familiar with the song as we go and so we'll hopefully sing it
[1897.64 --> 1904.44]  next week and we'll learn it together now as i mentioned there's no sunday school for today
[1904.44 --> 1912.20]  um but i brought some coloring sheets for the kids it has the verse on it for today and some
[1912.20 --> 1918.36]  crayons so if you are a child or if you just like the color there are adult coloring books
[1919.48 --> 1931.48]  please come on up and you can take one
[1931.48 --> 1943.32]  thank you gabby for leading the way
[1946.12 --> 1951.16]  um and i'll leave them up there so if any kids are out and about and who want to come up and take one
[1951.16 --> 1952.60]  that is just fine
[1952.60 --> 1961.96]  okay so today we are in the book of romans as many of you will know if you've been here
[1963.08 --> 1969.72]  for a while we've been walking through romans for just actually about a year now almost to the day
[1971.24 --> 1976.28]  and of course we've been taking pauses for the seasons of advent and lent and and other sundays
[1976.28 --> 1981.16]  guest preachers but we've been walking through the book of romans we've made it through chapters
[1981.16 --> 1989.48]  one through seven and today at last we arrive at romans chapter eight and romans chapter eight
[1989.48 --> 1994.44]  many of you if you've been a christian for some time you will be familiar with it you've probably
[1995.24 --> 2001.24]  memorized a lot of different parts of it and it is pretty much the consensus among christians that
[2001.24 --> 2008.84]  romans chapter 8 is probably perhaps the greatest chapter in the entire bible i mean now everyone
[2009.56 --> 2013.80]  every now and then people will say oh this is the greatest passage in the bible or something like
[2013.80 --> 2022.52]  that but it is really hard to imagine a passage of scripture that is more precious to the christian soul
[2023.32 --> 2032.20]  right that is filled with as much comfort and strength and assurance and joy in all of the promises of the lord
[2032.20 --> 2041.88]  and so dr j.i packer calls this the summit of scripture and so as we kind of you know using that
[2041.88 --> 2047.32]  image as we've journeyed through chapters one to seven we are now at the top of the mountain
[2048.12 --> 2054.92]  right and the air up here is crisp and it's fresh and there's this beautiful vista of god's goodness and
[2054.92 --> 2062.44]  grace that just opens up before us and so over the next several weeks we're actually going to slowly
[2062.44 --> 2070.28]  explore the riches of romans 7. it's almost like its own sermon series and so that is the road map
[2070.92 --> 2077.32]  and that will kind of take us all the way to advent so with that in mind let's read our passage this
[2077.32 --> 2089.48]  morning romans chapter 8 the first two verses we will have the scripture on the screen today there's
[2089.48 --> 2097.08]  only one slide but if you want to double check it is on page 841 in your p bible and i'll read from our
[2097.08 --> 2107.00]  rp bible 841 romans chapter 8 verses 1 to 2 therefore there is now no condemnation
[2109.64 --> 2117.48]  for those who are in christ jesus because through christ jesus the law of the spirit of life has set
[2117.48 --> 2124.84]  me free from the law of sin and death this is the word of the lord thanks be to god
[2124.84 --> 2132.36]  so let's ask for god's help in his blessing as we come before his word let's pray
[2134.52 --> 2141.00]  the lord our god we thank you for your word we thank you that we've come to a chapter that
[2142.04 --> 2150.68]  is so well known to many of us and yet lord how little our minds and even our hearts know of the
[2150.68 --> 2159.96]  realities spoken of here so lord would you cause your word to become a burning reality in our souls
[2161.08 --> 2167.72]  and lord like newborn babies would we desire the life-giving milk that gives us nourishment and that
[2167.72 --> 2175.16]  gives us life and that brings us to maturity in christ jesus so that we may love and serve you with all of
[2175.16 --> 2185.48]  our heart soul mind and strength we pray in christ's name and for his sake amen so this summer as i mentioned
[2186.36 --> 2194.04]  my family and i we took a trip back east and we had a wonderful time and while we were back in vermont
[2194.04 --> 2200.52]  which is where i grew up i spent an afternoon with two of my good friends from high school one of them
[2200.52 --> 2206.04]  drove up from connecticut one of them actually lives in town still and so we got together and like a
[2206.04 --> 2214.04]  bunch of well i have to be careful what i say um let's just say when we were younger we used to do kind
[2214.04 --> 2220.28]  of fun things together but now this time we actually just sat around for hours and we made dinner together
[2220.28 --> 2226.68]  we had like salmon so we were like oh we're getting so old now but that's what we did it was a good time
[2227.48 --> 2234.28]  and um and so we started talking about old times and it caught up on our lives but then starting about
[2234.28 --> 2238.76]  you know you get together with old friends you kind of remember back then when we did these things
[2239.32 --> 2246.44]  and one story in particular came up now for the record before i share um i certainly got up to some
[2246.44 --> 2253.72]  shenanigans with these friends but i was not involved in this one but here's the story one of these two
[2253.72 --> 2257.40]  friends i'm not going to use their names because this is live streamed and there have been no charges
[2257.40 --> 2265.00]  pressed yet while we were in high school one of them worked at the local country club the golf course
[2265.00 --> 2271.08]  during the summer months and so one summer night these two friends um after the golf course was
[2271.08 --> 2278.04]  closed for the day everyone's gone home is in the evening they decided it would be a good idea late
[2278.04 --> 2286.36]  at night to go back to the clubhouse and to make off aka steal some drinks and some snacks from the
[2286.36 --> 2295.40]  clubhouse so late at night they didn't turn on any lights and they snuck back in you know and um so
[2295.40 --> 2300.92]  there was this big walk-in refrigerator like you'd have at a restaurant and so they went inside the
[2300.92 --> 2307.32]  refrigerator to see what they could find you know some drinks or whatever and while they were inside they
[2307.32 --> 2316.44]  heard someone yell hey who's there who is it and it was the manager of the country club my friend's boss
[2316.44 --> 2321.96]  and so my two friends they completely panicked because of course they had no excuse for being
[2321.96 --> 2328.52]  there late at night and they were about to get busted so they closed the door quickly of the walk-in
[2328.52 --> 2335.08]  fridge and so they're inside the fridge with the door closed and the manager must have heard because
[2335.08 --> 2339.72]  he goes and he tries to open the door and my two friends inside with all of their strength are
[2339.72 --> 2345.32]  holding the door closed because you can't lock it from the inside so that this guy wouldn't be able to
[2345.32 --> 2353.56]  open it and they heard him yell out i'm calling the police and so luckily this was before cell phones
[2353.56 --> 2360.28]  because he had to go leave and make a phone call and so my friends were able to sneak out and get away
[2360.28 --> 2366.68]  without being identified and as they were retelling this story and they're like thanks a lot for
[2366.68 --> 2373.08]  bringing this up they said it was the most terrified they had ever been right they were trapped and they
[2373.08 --> 2378.52]  thought they would be caught and found out and maybe go to jail who knows or something certainly get fired
[2379.16 --> 2386.76]  from his job now i don't imagine any of you have ever been trapped inside a walk-in refrigerator
[2386.76 --> 2394.52]  but we have all experienced times in our lives in one way or another when we have felt desperately
[2394.52 --> 2404.52]  afraid of being judged for some bad thing that we have maybe said or done we we have this desperate
[2404.52 --> 2412.68]  fear of the shame of our bad behavior and someone else condemning us and judging us for it
[2412.68 --> 2420.52]  you know in earlier in romans in romans chapter 7 we found out actually that our worst nightmare
[2421.56 --> 2429.48]  this being judged being condemned is actually going to come true right in romans chapter 2 verse 16 paul
[2429.48 --> 2438.68]  says that god will judge the secrets of our hearts which is an absolutely frightening prospect for all of us
[2438.68 --> 2448.04]  right all of our sins all of our flaws will be exposed we cannot keep ourselves shut up and not discovered
[2448.04 --> 2459.08]  it's all going to be laid out before an absolutely pure and holy god and that is the bad news of every single
[2459.08 --> 2467.00]  human being according to paul in the book of romans that in adam you and i are under god's condemnation because of
[2467.00 --> 2476.12]  our sinful fallen nature the sins that we do and the good we fail to do and that's what makes romans
[2476.12 --> 2486.52]  chapter 8 so precious to us right and the whole point of romans 8 is how good god is to weak people like us
[2487.64 --> 2495.80]  that's what it's all about romans chapter 8 how good god is to weak sinful people like us
[2495.80 --> 2503.48]  and in these first two verses we have the answer to a question that we all ask what help does god have
[2503.48 --> 2511.00]  for people like us like what help does god have well goodness and grace towards people like us does god
[2511.00 --> 2517.80]  give us and what we find here is the grace of god for sinners in two ways first that there is no
[2517.80 --> 2523.40]  condemnation in christ jesus and then second that we have the gift of the holy spirit
[2523.40 --> 2530.52]  okay so let's look at these first two verses of romans 8 and the help that god gives us and the first
[2530.52 --> 2537.72]  one again is just that there is no condemnation so look with me at verse one paul writes therefore
[2537.72 --> 2542.44]  there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
[2544.76 --> 2550.76]  this is a verse many of us have likely even memorized but what is paul talking about
[2550.76 --> 2560.04]  well paul is talking about a verdict right so imagine that you are a defendant that you are going
[2560.04 --> 2569.08]  through some legal proceedings and the evidence that against you is laid out the case is made and at the
[2569.08 --> 2576.20]  end you will receive a verdict right you will either be acquitted and set free you're not guilty or you will
[2576.20 --> 2586.12]  be condemned and judged as guilty now if god were to investigate your life right if he were to
[2586.12 --> 2591.56]  investigate all of the scenes that run through your mind that flash through it if he were in to
[2591.56 --> 2598.44]  investigate the things that you have said in public or in private if you were to investigate the things
[2598.44 --> 2606.44]  that you failed to do that you should have done or the idols in your life or the ways in which you have
[2606.44 --> 2613.88]  basically put others before him and you have put yourself before others right if god were to investigate
[2613.88 --> 2618.92]  any of these things you would be condemned the evidence is laid out the case is made and we would all be
[2618.92 --> 2627.40]  guilty right and so god gave us the law he gave us the torah which we were to live by as his covenant people
[2628.52 --> 2635.32]  and and there were blessings attached to covenant faithfulness and keeping the law and there were curses attached
[2635.32 --> 2643.56]  to covenant unfaithfulness and that curse all along basically what it is is exile being separated from god
[2643.56 --> 2649.72]  and we have actually in fact all been unfaithful we have failed to live by the law we don't love god
[2649.72 --> 2655.16]  with all of our heart soul mind and strength we don't love our neighbor as ourselves we are all we stand
[2655.16 --> 2666.28]  condemned we're guilty and yet what does paul say he doesn't say there is condemnation he says there is now
[2666.28 --> 2677.96]  no condemnation right so god he takes brokenhearted failures like you and me who then just collapse into
[2677.96 --> 2683.56]  the arms of christ and he carries them to this new place where there is no condemnation
[2685.96 --> 2694.76]  and notice that little word no right in the original greek text the word no is the very first word in the
[2694.76 --> 2702.84]  the sentence in verse 1. paul puts it first for emphasis to make it emphatic no there is now
[2702.84 --> 2709.88]  condemnation right and so it means none at all right not just only a little bit of condemnation or just a
[2709.88 --> 2714.92]  little bit of judgment absolutely no condemnation free and clear
[2714.92 --> 2725.64]  right who would think such a little word could mean so much to us so now you know there is a very good
[2725.64 --> 2732.52]  question we might ask ourselves is this condemnation that has been obliterated that there is no more
[2732.52 --> 2740.52]  condemnation will this be a future reality in the life of the christian like when we die or when christ returns
[2740.52 --> 2750.92]  all right is this something we have to wait for now why is that a good question it's because it makes
[2750.92 --> 2757.64]  all the difference to our christian lives today right it's the difference between living a christian
[2757.64 --> 2764.76]  life with joy and peace and assurance before god or living a christian life with fear and dread
[2764.76 --> 2772.28]  about what verdict we may face in the future right it's the difference between running away from god
[2772.28 --> 2779.16]  and running towards god and the answer is that we see here this verdict of no condemnation
[2779.80 --> 2784.12]  it's not something we have to wait for in the future but it is a present reality
[2785.48 --> 2792.12]  and so think about jesus right his life on earth and in his conversation with the pharisees and the
[2792.12 --> 2799.72]  religious leaders what we learn is that the pharisees they were waiting for a future verdict
[2800.68 --> 2806.84]  they would say one day god's going to come in the future and he is going to vindicate the righteous
[2808.04 --> 2813.64]  and they would say that is why we must be so careful and scrupulous to keep the law and actually
[2813.64 --> 2820.52]  we're going to make this huge hedge of protection around the law by adding lots more laws that god didn't
[2820.52 --> 2827.64]  even give just to make absolutely sure that we never even come close to breaking god's law
[2829.08 --> 2832.36]  and thereby being found unrighteous
[2834.60 --> 2841.56]  but what god has done in jesus christ is he has taken that future verdict and he's brought it into the
[2841.56 --> 2848.84]  present right because of the life the perfect life of our lord jesus his death on the cross his resurrection
[2848.84 --> 2859.56]  his ascension all of which by which god has declared jesus vindicated and that means all of those who
[2859.56 --> 2868.44]  believe in christ we will share his vindication so that there is now no condemnation christ has been
[2868.44 --> 2875.80]  vindicated so in christ you also even right now not in the future but now you are declared not guilty
[2875.80 --> 2878.36]  you there is no condemnation you are there is no condemnation
[2881.40 --> 2888.60]  and friends what that means is that you right now can open up your heart to god right you don't have
[2888.60 --> 2896.52]  to run away from him in fear you can run towards him into his arms of mercy because there is no condemnation
[2896.52 --> 2905.32]  well that brings us to some other words that are really important here because every single word in
[2905.32 --> 2916.76]  verse one is important so notice those words for those who are in christ jesus for those who are in christ jesus
[2916.76 --> 2929.64]  you know and so it doesn't say there's no now no condemnation for the high achievers or there is now
[2929.64 --> 2936.20]  no condemnation for the very religious or the morally good or for people who have their lives together
[2936.20 --> 2946.52]  but just for those who are in christ jesus and so what paul is talking about here is our union with christ
[2947.56 --> 2955.16]  so think about it this way that god has taken your life your story and he has written your story into
[2955.16 --> 2958.60]  the story of the life and death and resurrection of jesus christ
[2958.60 --> 2970.28]  and as a result you and i are now in two places at once you are not just in one place you are in two places
[2971.00 --> 2980.20]  so right now where are we we are in ladner right and just as in a real sense you are also
[2980.20 --> 2986.12]  in christ at this very moment you are in that ladner and you are in christ jesus christ has become
[2986.12 --> 2991.32]  in a sense your new address and so what could happen ladner could maybe some great catastrophe could
[2991.32 --> 2999.80]  happen and ladner could fall into the sea this afternoon and be obliterated but your place in
[2999.80 --> 3006.60]  christ is as indestructible as christ is himself right and that's why the new testament in all the
[3006.60 --> 3013.16]  new testament over and over it never stops talking about the amazingness of our union with christ
[3013.16 --> 3023.64]  christ so there is a hymn it's called a debtor to mercy alone a debtor to mercy alone anyone know that
[3023.64 --> 3029.56]  hymn you may not because i couldn't find it in the grace altar hymnal right which is the hymnal that we're
[3029.56 --> 3038.44]  all familiar with but let me just share some of the words with you the words are really amazing and um
[3038.44 --> 3043.72]  they relate directly to romans chapter 8 okay and so all the verses are amazing but let me just read
[3043.72 --> 3051.88]  the last verse so this is what it says my name from the palms of his hands eternity will not erase
[3053.16 --> 3062.36]  impressed on his heart it remains in marks of indelible grace yes i to the end shall endure
[3062.36 --> 3073.56]  as sure as the earnest is given and listen to this more happy but not more secure the glorified saints in
[3073.56 --> 3081.40]  heaven right more happy yes okay so the people in heaven are more happy than us right now who live in
[3081.40 --> 3088.20]  this world of sin and sorrow but the hymn writer is saying though they are more happy they are not more
[3088.20 --> 3097.00]  secure than us why because there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
[3098.44 --> 3105.64]  and in fact if you are in christ jesus you are not only as secure as the saints in heaven you are as
[3105.64 --> 3116.12]  secure as secure as christ who is in heaven right you are entitled as entitled to heaven as christ is himself
[3117.72 --> 3122.20]  because there is no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
[3124.52 --> 3134.60]  and that means friends that the deepest truth about you now is not your unsteady ups and downs of faith
[3134.60 --> 3141.00]  your unsteady ups and downs of the christian life right the deepest truth about you right now is that god
[3141.00 --> 3151.64]  has encircled you he has enclosed you safely in jesus christ and friends that's where we start in the
[3151.64 --> 3157.80]  christian life that is where we stay in the christian life and that is where we right now stand in the
[3157.80 --> 3167.88]  christian life enclosed and encircled safely in christ okay so that's the first way that god helps us he
[3167.88 --> 3175.96]  declares over us no condemnation in christ and that is amazing now more briefly god also helps us in a
[3175.96 --> 3181.24]  second way that we want to look at today the second way that god helps us is he gives us in verse 2
[3181.24 --> 3188.04]  the life and the freedom of the spirit okay so we're he starts to talk about the spirit in verse 2 next
[3188.04 --> 3193.80]  week in verses 3 and 4 we're going to continue to look at this more in depth but let's look at verse 2
[3193.80 --> 3201.56]  it says why is there no condemnation for those in christ because through christ jesus the law of the spirit who
[3201.56 --> 3208.04]  gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death okay so let's just look at that kind of simply
[3208.04 --> 3214.84]  today paul says there are two laws or two principles there's the law of the spirit of life
[3215.64 --> 3221.88]  and there's the law of sin and death and in the commentaries as you kind of look at romans 8
[3221.88 --> 3227.56]  there was um this kind of clever little rhyme that a commentator had so this is what the rhyme says
[3228.68 --> 3232.20]  he says moses's law has right but not might
[3232.20 --> 3240.76]  sin's law has might i may have said the first one wrong okay let me start over moses's law has
[3240.76 --> 3246.44]  right but not might sin's law has might but not right but the law of the spirit has both right and
[3246.44 --> 3253.48]  might clear as day right no what okay so let i think you know as i really meditated on this this is what
[3253.48 --> 3262.12]  it says moses's law okay the torah the law of god it has rights meaning god has rights over you
[3262.84 --> 3270.28]  right the law has the power to command you to keep the law but it doesn't have any might meaning it
[3270.28 --> 3276.04]  doesn't help you to do it so left to ourselves in our fallen humanity in adam the law will only
[3276.04 --> 3284.52]  exacerbate sin not make you less sinful it has no ability to help you keep the law okay now sin's law
[3285.32 --> 3292.92]  it has no right over you right sin has no authority in your life and yet it is so powerful it has might
[3293.48 --> 3301.80]  right we all know the power of sin in us but then the law of the spirit comes and it has right and might
[3301.80 --> 3310.12]  in other words god has the right to command our obedience but in the new covenant he has given us
[3310.12 --> 3316.36]  the gift of the holy spirit and so now the law that god requires he gives us the ability to keep it it
[3316.36 --> 3327.72]  has right and might and so we live now not by the law of moses or by the law of sin we live now by the law of the spirit
[3327.72 --> 3338.20]  so i heard this illustrated in a sermon this way that if i were to have a rock in my hand and if i
[3338.20 --> 3345.48]  were to throw that rock there is a law of gravity that would make that rock fall to the ground right
[3346.12 --> 3350.84]  that's the law of gravity the rock will fall however hard i throw that rock that rock will fall
[3350.84 --> 3358.84]  but you see if instead i had a live bird and i threw that bird into the air what would happen
[3359.48 --> 3367.24]  the law of gravity has in a sense okay doesn't have power over that bird there's a new law at play
[3367.24 --> 3376.12]  and so the bird flies and like this before you're in christ before you've received the spirit you are a rock
[3376.12 --> 3384.20]  and all you can do is fall and all you can do is crash but now in christ you have received a new law
[3384.20 --> 3392.44]  a new law of the spirit where you are set free and you are able to fly right so since domination has been
[3392.44 --> 3401.80]  broken you now live by a different law the law of freedom that enables you to fly and so in other words
[3401.80 --> 3409.48]  it's like a whole new relationship with god that he has defined for us has been given where we now
[3409.48 --> 3415.88]  live by the spirit so what does that look like well let me just share this this final example with you
[3417.64 --> 3424.04]  it's an example of the transformation that happens when the holy spirit comes and begins to work in a
[3424.04 --> 3431.24]  person's heart so on the first sunday of my summer holidays my family and i went and visited
[3431.24 --> 3438.92]  our previous church in richmond where i used to serve emmanuel crc and so actually victor came and
[3438.92 --> 3442.44]  preached for you while i was away and he's the he took my position he's the new english pastor
[3443.48 --> 3449.32]  now there's a young man at this church named david and when i knew him he was not yet a christian
[3449.96 --> 3455.64]  you know at the time he was coming to church and he was curious about christianity but he had lots of
[3455.64 --> 3460.36]  he wasn't convinced and he had lots of good questions and so we i would met up with him and we talked
[3460.36 --> 3467.00]  about the gospel we talked about christianity well this last visit that i made this last time just a
[3467.00 --> 3473.48]  few weeks ago right after the worship service david comes up to me and with his huge smile on his face
[3473.48 --> 3484.44]  says pastor jason i have been baptized and i could just see the difference in his smile in his eyes in his
[3484.44 --> 3490.20]  joy and he was volunteering at the kids camp he was serving others
[3492.52 --> 3499.00]  and and you could just see this the law of the spirit that gives life working in his heart changing
[3499.00 --> 3505.56]  him making him a new person and friends that is the law of the spirit at play right is god changing you
[3505.56 --> 3514.84]  from the inside is in turn internalizing the law of god in your heart so whereas once we were thieves
[3515.48 --> 3523.56]  we become generous where we were adulterers we become devoted and faithful where we were once covetous
[3524.12 --> 3532.28]  covetous people we become content right we who would never go to a church become sabbath keepers
[3532.28 --> 3542.04]  and we find in ourselves even to our own surprise a new love for god and a new desire to grow in christ
[3542.04 --> 3546.12]  and a new tender humility and a willingness to serve others and all of these things
[3547.88 --> 3555.16]  and that's when we are finally becoming alive which is why it is called the law of the spirit of life
[3556.52 --> 3562.20]  right and it's not this new ideal this new thing where we have to live up to it but rather
[3562.20 --> 3569.48]  god's it's god's gift to us in which he provides everything that we need the finished work of christ
[3569.48 --> 3575.48]  on the cross whereby there's no condemnation verse one and the endless power of the holy spirit who gives
[3575.48 --> 3587.80]  freedom in life verse two you know lastly romans 8 it does not have a single command for us to obey
[3587.80 --> 3597.88]  romans 8 has no command so how are we to live this out friends we live it out by believing what god says to us
[3599.00 --> 3607.40]  the god who in his own power spoke creation into existence says to you there is no condemnation
[3608.04 --> 3609.80]  for those who are in christ jesus
[3609.80 --> 3619.80]  do you believe that that's all you have to do is believe it accept it has it changed your life
[3621.00 --> 3627.40]  so that you are no longer desperately afraid of being condemned being found out but rather you are
[3627.96 --> 3635.24]  assured of god's love for you because you stand in jesus christ let's pray
[3635.24 --> 3646.92]  father we thank you for your word and lord for the glories of how you declare us to be
[3648.36 --> 3655.32]  far and far beyond what we are in ourselves that our identity and our worth and our significance and
[3655.32 --> 3663.16]  our security and our joy and our strength is in christ and there it is secure forever
[3663.16 --> 3670.04]  immovable unshakable unconquerable help us lord to live in the power of your spirit
[3670.68 --> 3674.76]  for the sake of jesus christ our lord in whose name we pray amen
[3678.04 --> 3690.04]  let's stand and let's sing our song of response together
[3693.16 --> 3713.64]  how can it be that i should gain an interest in the savior's blood
[3713.64 --> 3716.32]  Savior's blood.
[3717.12 --> 3731.26]  Died he for me, who caused his fear, for me he who caused his bitter death.
[3731.26 --> 3746.28]  Amazing love, how can it be that you, my Lord, should die for me?
[3746.28 --> 3761.84]  Amazing love, how can it be that you, my Lord, should die for me?
[3761.84 --> 3777.82]  Long my imprisoned spirit lay, fast bound in sin that nature's night.
[3777.82 --> 3792.92]  Your sunrise turned that night to day, I woke the dungeon flamed with light.
[3792.92 --> 3800.38]  My chains fell off, your voice I knew.
[3800.92 --> 3807.96]  My rose bent out and followed you.
[3807.96 --> 3823.72]  Amazing love, how can it be that you, my Lord, should die for me?
[3823.72 --> 3839.84]  No condemnation now I tread, for Christ and all in him is mine.
[3839.84 --> 3854.88]  Alive in him, my living hand, and clothed in righteousness divine.
[3854.88 --> 3870.18]  Bold I approach the eternal throne, and clean the ground through Christ my own.
[3870.18 --> 3886.56]  Amazing love, how can it be that you, my Lord, should die for me?
[3900.18 --> 3905.74]  I just thought I should say that my two friends who I mentioned are now law-abiding citizens.
[3906.48 --> 3909.62]  And actually one of them is a police officer, so there you go.
[3911.64 --> 3914.18]  So we love because he first loved us.
[3914.64 --> 3921.50]  And in response to his mercy, we are invited to give back of our time, our talents, and our treasures.
[3922.02 --> 3926.16]  To contribute to the household of faith and to God's kingdom work.
[3926.16 --> 3931.94]  And so the deacons will come forward and pass the baskets to collect any gifts that you brought with you today.
[3932.50 --> 3936.38]  Our designated offering is for the Vancouver Short-Term Mission Training Center.
[3937.24 --> 3943.76]  And, you know, this is an organization that kind of comes alongside churches and does training in evangelism.
[3944.18 --> 3947.06]  And sharing our faith in Vancouver.
[3947.56 --> 3952.74]  So we support them, and they've had a real role in our Chinese ministry as well.
[3952.74 --> 3956.66]  So, may I invite the deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[3956.66 --> 3965.72]  You, great deal.
[3965.94 --> 3969.98]  Thank you.
[3969.98 --> 3971.38]  Thank you.
[3972.84 --> 3973.82]  Thank you.
[3974.46 --> 3976.72]  Thank you.
[3976.78 --> 3978.06]  Thank you.
[3978.52 --> 3979.52]  Yes.
[3980.04 --> 3980.64]  Thank you.
[3980.88 --> 3981.60]  Thank you.
[3981.60 --> 3983.60]  Amen.
[4011.60 --> 4013.60]  Amen.
[4041.60 --> 4043.60]  Amen.
[4071.60 --> 4073.60]  Amen.
[4073.60 --> 4074.60]  Amen.
[4078.60 --> 4084.60]  So let's turn our hearts to the Lord in prayer as we pray for our church and the world.
[4085.16 --> 4087.88]  And we will conclude by saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4088.48 --> 4090.38]  And the words will be on the screen when we do that.
[4090.90 --> 4092.00]  So please join me in prayer.
[4094.72 --> 4100.60]  The Lord is our rock, our fortress, and our deliverer.
[4101.84 --> 4112.06]  Our God is our rock in whom we take refuge, our shield and the horn of our salvation, our stronghold.
[4113.02 --> 4118.56]  We called to the Lord who is worthy of praise, and we have been saved from our enemies.
[4120.68 --> 4125.12]  Lord, may your blessings flow over this world that you have made.
[4125.12 --> 4132.66]  Father, we live in a tumultuous world, bruised and battered by sin.
[4133.56 --> 4144.44]  So Lord, we especially pray over the war-torn areas of our world, places where battles rage, where harm is done, where people are injured or starving or killed.
[4144.44 --> 4153.74]  And Lord, when peace seems impossible by human means, Lord, we know that the nations are under your sovereign power.
[4154.00 --> 4160.66]  And that you can and will one day bring everlasting peace.
[4161.06 --> 4163.72]  And the peace that covers and envelops all the nations.
[4163.72 --> 4174.22]  For as the Psalms say, from where the sun rises to where it sets, in every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to you,
[4174.76 --> 4179.60]  because your name will be great among the nations, says the Lord Almighty.
[4179.60 --> 4184.78]  And Lord, may your blessings flow over our world leaders.
[4185.10 --> 4190.98]  Lord, we ask for your hand to guide them and to teach them to lead with compassion and justice and mercy.
[4191.80 --> 4198.24]  Ever mindful of the weak and ever mindful of the responsibility to care for your creation
[4198.24 --> 4202.28]  and mindful to protect the freedom of your gospel,
[4203.00 --> 4208.54]  that it may go forth calling men, women and children to know and worship our Lord Jesus.
[4209.60 --> 4214.66]  Lord, may your blessings flow over the Vancouver Short-Term Mission Training Center.
[4215.40 --> 4220.54]  Lord, we pray for their work, their ministry of proclaiming your gospel in Vancouver,
[4221.32 --> 4226.48]  their ministry also of helping churches, equipping them to share their faith.
[4227.36 --> 4233.04]  Lord, we thank you for their partnership in our gospel work here at Ladner CRC over the years.
[4234.78 --> 4237.26]  Lord, may your blessings flow over our city.
[4237.26 --> 4242.48]  Lord, may your blessings flow over our city as we pray, Lord, for revival in Ladner
[4242.48 --> 4244.88]  and in all the places where we live.
[4245.58 --> 4251.30]  Lord, we pray for many people who do not yet know you to come to know our Lord Jesus Christ
[4251.30 --> 4256.84]  and to know the peace of your kingdom, the freedom of the Spirit
[4256.84 --> 4262.58]  and the no condemnation that we can have in our Savior.
[4262.58 --> 4269.26]  Lord, we specifically pray, Lord, for those on our hearts, those people we know,
[4269.34 --> 4273.50]  whether they are family or friends or neighbors, Lord, who do not yet know you.
[4275.32 --> 4276.74]  Lord, we ask for your mercy.
[4280.30 --> 4286.94]  Lord, we may your blessings flow over those in our congregation who need your healing and your care.
[4286.94 --> 4293.60]  Lord, we especially pray this morning for Henny, who has been feeling just very unwell
[4293.60 --> 4297.42]  and the doctors are still not yet sure what is happening.
[4298.38 --> 4305.80]  And Lord, as she also waits to go into long-term care, we ask for, Lord, your mercy and your presence with her.
[4306.52 --> 4313.94]  We pray, Lord, also for Wilma, who likewise has been experiencing all kinds of different pains and discomforts.
[4313.94 --> 4320.14]  And Lord, as our health fails, we feel, Lord, the fear of that.
[4320.48 --> 4323.20]  So, Lord, would your Spirit also be at work.
[4325.22 --> 4330.22]  Lord, may your blessings flow over the upcoming start of school.
[4331.20 --> 4333.98]  We thank you for the summer, the beautiful weather.
[4334.76 --> 4338.08]  We thank you, Lord, for holidays and time off from our usual routines.
[4338.08 --> 4344.68]  And as a new school year approaches, help us to look forward to another season of learning.
[4345.62 --> 4348.64]  Be with the children and the teachers as they return to school.
[4349.46 --> 4353.64]  And Lord, even in our church as well, for those of us who aren't going to school,
[4353.80 --> 4358.34]  would you also help us look forward to opportunities to grow in faith each week,
[4358.62 --> 4364.42]  to learn more of your great promises and your love for us through our various ministries that we have here.
[4364.42 --> 4369.12]  And Father, we bring all these prayers to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4369.18 --> 4370.98]  who taught us to pray, saying together,
[4371.42 --> 4375.70]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4376.18 --> 4380.86]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4381.42 --> 4387.46]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[4387.88 --> 4391.74]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4391.74 --> 4396.32]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[4397.00 --> 4397.40]  Amen.
[4400.96 --> 4403.66]  Okay, let's, um, unless I'm missing something.
[4403.80 --> 4404.34]  Let's all stand.
[4406.04 --> 4410.64]  And we go out with the Lord's final word upon us.
[4410.68 --> 4415.24]  He called us to worship and he sends us, as I mentioned, to bless the world in his name.
[4415.74 --> 4419.36]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving that blessing.
[4419.36 --> 4428.04]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[4428.68 --> 4431.62]  neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
[4432.00 --> 4437.30]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4437.30 --> 4438.30]  Amen.
[4440.46 --> 4442.22]  And, uh, we'll sing one more song.
[4442.74 --> 4449.68]  And, but before we do that, um, please do join us in the fellowship hall right after the service for coffee and time to get to know one another.
[4449.68 --> 4464.06]  Father, the one who still is loved,
[4464.06 --> 4469.80]  Glory to your name.
[4469.80 --> 4477.22]  Jesus, the one who died yet lives,
[4477.22 --> 4482.38]  You have taken all our shame.
[4482.38 --> 4505.04]  Spirit, who still melts hearts and stone, will never be the same.
[4505.04 --> 4516.32]  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the one true God.
[4516.32 --> 4524.98]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4524.98 --> 4533.56]  Father, the one who still is loved,
[4533.56 --> 4538.84]  Glory to your name.
[4538.84 --> 4544.46]  Jesus, the one who dies yet lives,
[4544.46 --> 4549.42]  You have taken all our shame.
[4549.42 --> 4560.10]  Spirit, who still melts hearts and stone, will never be the same.
[4560.10 --> 4571.68]  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to the one true God.
[4571.68 --> 4581.16]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4581.16 --> 4591.78]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4601.68 --> 4630.00]  Father, Son, and Spirit, glory to your name.
[4630.00 --> 4632.00]  Amen.
[4660.00 --> 4662.00]  Amen.
[4690.00 --> 4692.00]  Amen.
