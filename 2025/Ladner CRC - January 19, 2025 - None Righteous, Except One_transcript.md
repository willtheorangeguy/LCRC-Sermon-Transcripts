[557.10 --> 557.40]  Amen.
[559.52 --> 563.96]  Our Lord God has called us to worship and now greets us with these words from Zephaniah 3.

[570.46 --> 571.96]  He will quiet you with his love.
[572.38 --> 574.60]  He will rejoice over you with singing.

[857.60 --> 859.60]  Amen.
[859.60 --> 868.60]  Let us sing that you see, and let us hear to you, shall we?
[868.60 --> 874.60]  Shout in the glory of the new precious name,
[874.60 --> 879.60]  Shower of mountains, we praise you to all.
[879.60 --> 890.60]  Mountains bow down and the seas will roll, and shall still be the precious name.
[890.60 --> 895.60]  I sing that you are the Lord of such friends,
[895.60 --> 901.60]  Forever and loving the heavenly will sing,
[901.60 --> 910.60]  The mission best of the new ocean, so near.
[914.60 --> 922.60]  My Jesus, my Savior, no, there is none like you.
[922.60 --> 935.60]  All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[935.60 --> 943.60]  Ad�� F privileged and lucky close to you.
[943.60 --> 950.60]  In happiness, love companionscolored Veloc开 bat.
[950.60 --> 956.60]  Losing most petals will simply manifest believers,
[956.60 --> 961.60]  and the second Chuck mole in me is a Mormon soul.
[961.60 --> 969.82]  Sing, while I'm young, I'll just be bags allTouch that speak out with dreams
[969.82 --> 983.02]  And they'll sing in tune with your name
[983.02 --> 989.58] 傘e and chow be glor vegan for the names
[989.58 --> 1017.58]  is
[1017.58 --> 1025.02]  congregation can people be good without knowing god this is a challenging question our world of
[1025.02 --> 1031.10]  course says yes and it makes a compelling argument there are many people who do not go to church nor
[1031.10 --> 1037.90]  follow jesus and yet they are kind compassionate and selfless spending their time caring for the poor
[1037.90 --> 1044.46]  and working towards good things like peace and justice therefore cannot we not call these people
[1044.46 --> 1049.98]  good i personally know many people who have done far more than i to improve the lives of their
[1049.98 --> 1057.10]  fellow human beings does this not count for something let's listen to jesus words in mark 10
[1057.10 --> 1063.42]  where we read that as jesus started on his way a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him
[1063.42 --> 1071.82]  good teacher he asked what must i do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good jesus answered
[1072.62 --> 1079.90]  no one is good except god alone and then in acts 4 we read salvation is found in no one else for
[1079.90 --> 1087.82]  there is no other name under heaven given to mankind which we may be saved the truth is no we cannot be
[1087.82 --> 1093.50]  good apart from god this can be a painful truth that we as christians struggle with on this side of
[1093.50 --> 1100.54]  heaven especially with so many of our friends and family who do not go to church of course an atheist
[1100.54 --> 1106.78]  or a buddhist or a muslim or a sikh or a hindu person can do good works and affect real positive change
[1106.78 --> 1112.86]  in people's lives we shouldn't discount that and in fact we should praise god for such people
[1112.86 --> 1120.86]  these people are his creation and it is from god that all blessings flow but god also tells us that
[1120.86 --> 1128.30]  good works no matter how selfless no matter how loving or sacrificial do not make us capital g good
[1129.42 --> 1137.90]  the bible is quite clear with god good and evil are binary it is one or the other indeed as jason read to
[1137.90 --> 1145.10]  us last week one is taken into the grain barn and the other is destroyed consumed by unquenchable fire
[1146.22 --> 1151.02]  let us come to god now and ask for wisdom and mercy let's pray
[1154.94 --> 1164.30]  heavenly father we come free come to you this morning as a sinful people you alone are good we humbly
[1164.30 --> 1172.06]  submit to you lord offering the work of our hands and the words on our lips as sacrifices to glorify your
[1172.06 --> 1180.46]  name we know that we cannot climb out from the pit of sinfulness on our own merits instead we give thanks
[1180.46 --> 1188.14]  for your goodness and mercy for perfect righteousness in jesus who was sent to us to die for us that we may
[1188.14 --> 1195.42]  have eternal life we thank you lord for the blessings your hands have provided we thank you this morning
[1195.42 --> 1201.58]  for our neighbors for those who work in soup kitchens and hospitals and rehab clinics and war zones tending
[1201.58 --> 1209.58]  to the sick and the poor and the broken your grace and mercy work through them whether they profess faith in
[1209.58 --> 1217.10]  you or not we pray then lord that these people come to know you as we know you may they reflect upon their
[1217.10 --> 1223.74]  love and sacrifice of their and the sacrifice of their co-workers and realize that you alone are the source
[1223.74 --> 1232.78]  of all that is good here on earth and we pray for us as christians that all we do is done in humility and
[1232.78 --> 1240.22]  never self-seeking but rather god-seeking and never wicked judgmental or an affront to your holy name
[1241.10 --> 1246.06]  we pray this in jesus name and by the power of the holy spirit amen
[1248.30 --> 1260.78]  let us now sing yet not i but through christ in me
[1262.78 --> 1268.46]  0
[1268.46 --> 1274.46]  There is no more for heaven not to give
[1275.14 --> 1280.46]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom
[1280.98 --> 1286.46]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
[1287.38 --> 1292.46]  To this our hope, our hope is only Jesus
[1292.46 --> 1298.46]  For the life is holy, bound to me
[1299.46 --> 1304.46]  Oh, how strange and divine I can sing
[1304.46 --> 1311.46]  All is one, if not I, but through Christ in me
[1311.46 --> 1321.46]  gesehen
[1322.46 --> 1326.46]  Father the golden love, my御非ene or the lard
[1327.46 --> 1329.46]  The love of God, Himself, will ε Tages
[1330.46 --> 1332.46]  to me
[1332.46 --> 1338.46]  I am not a man, but I will be able to see who I am.
[1338.46 --> 1344.46]  I am a man, I will be able to see who I am.
[1344.46 --> 1350.46]  I am a man, I will be able to forgive me.
[1350.46 --> 1356.46]  I will be able to see who I am.
[1356.46 --> 1369.46]  I am changing and racism in you together.
[1369.46 --> 1373.46]  And can we see your vision?
[1373.46 --> 1384.70]  The following song
[1384.70 --> 1395.80]  People of God, the time is approaching where good works will be no more.
[1396.64 --> 1400.76]  We won't need a soup kitchen volunteer or a doctor without borders.
[1401.30 --> 1402.78]  As we read in Revelation,
[1403.46 --> 1407.04]  Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[1407.44 --> 1410.88]  for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
[1411.54 --> 1413.56]  and there was no longer any sea.
[1413.56 --> 1419.00]  I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven from God,
[1419.44 --> 1422.76]  prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed for her husband.
[1423.34 --> 1425.66]  I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[1425.84 --> 1430.82]  Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them.
[1431.72 --> 1437.14]  They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
[1437.74 --> 1440.46]  He will wipe every tear from their eyes,
[1440.46 --> 1446.44]  and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[1446.44 --> 1450.54]  for the old order of things has passed away.
[1451.74 --> 1453.66]  He who is seated on the throne said,
[1454.08 --> 1455.50]  I am making everything new.
[1455.98 --> 1460.68]  Then he said, Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.
[1460.68 --> 1462.96]  He said to me, It is done.
[1463.46 --> 1465.74]  I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[1466.32 --> 1468.34]  the beginning and the end.
[1471.06 --> 1473.94]  To the thirsty I will give water without cost,
[1474.24 --> 1476.74]  from the spring of the water of life.
[1477.74 --> 1479.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1480.34 --> 1481.32]  Thank you, God.
[1481.32 --> 1486.80]  Why don't we stand now for the last two verses of Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1486.80 --> 1516.78]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1516.80 --> 1546.78]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1546.80 --> 1576.78]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1576.78 --> 1606.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1606.76 --> 1608.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1608.76 --> 1610.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1610.76 --> 1611.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1611.76 --> 1616.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1616.76 --> 1619.90]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1621.76 --> 1624.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1625.76 --> 1627.76]  Not Yet I Through Christ's Me.
[1627.76 --> 1632.34]  So as we prepare to celebrate the Lord's Supper today,
[1632.34 --> 1636.72]  let us first confess what we believe.
[1637.28 --> 1641.90]  And we will have this confession of faith with the words of the Heidelberg Catechism,
[1642.48 --> 1644.44]  question and answer number one.
[1645.04 --> 1647.56]  So let's say this together.
[1647.68 --> 1650.48]  I'll ask the question and I'll invite you all to read the answer together.
[1652.00 --> 1655.52]  What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[1655.52 --> 1666.16]  That I am not my own, but belong body and soul in life and in death to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[1666.70 --> 1671.52]  He has fully paid for all my sins with His precious blood
[1671.52 --> 1675.58]  and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.
[1676.42 --> 1682.76]  He also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head
[1682.76 --> 1685.92]  without the will of my Father in heaven.
[1686.72 --> 1691.18]  In fact, all things must work together for my salvation.
[1692.16 --> 1696.48]  Because I belong to Him, Christ, by His Holy Spirit,
[1697.02 --> 1699.02]  assures me of eternal life
[1699.02 --> 1705.78]  and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for Him.
[1708.24 --> 1711.72]  So we come now to the Lord's table.
[1712.76 --> 1715.66]  This is not Ladner CRC's table.
[1716.48 --> 1719.04]  This is not a Christian reform table.
[1719.18 --> 1722.58]  This is the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1724.56 --> 1727.00]  And who is this table for?
[1727.22 --> 1731.16]  It is for all those who recognize their helplessness
[1731.16 --> 1735.56]  and their hopelessness apart from His grace.
[1735.56 --> 1739.68]  And this bread represents it well.
[1739.78 --> 1742.20]  If we come acknowledging our brokenness
[1742.20 --> 1744.58]  and Jesus' wholeness
[1744.58 --> 1750.02]  and that Jesus who is whole was broken for us
[1750.02 --> 1754.02]  so that we who are broken might be then made whole,
[1755.02 --> 1757.50]  then this table is for you.
[1757.50 --> 1765.96]  This meal is for all those who have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1765.96 --> 1772.64]  and who do not trust themselves to get out of the dark cave
[1772.64 --> 1774.76]  that we're all in because of our sin,
[1775.28 --> 1778.40]  but who look to Jesus, who came in with His light,
[1778.90 --> 1780.28]  and who came to rescue us.
[1780.28 --> 1782.86]  And so if you are here this morning
[1782.86 --> 1784.74]  and you do not yet believe in Jesus,
[1785.64 --> 1789.10]  if you have not taken His name upon yourself in baptism,
[1789.70 --> 1794.00]  then we're asking you not to receive this meal right now
[1794.00 --> 1796.42]  as the elements are passed to you,
[1796.82 --> 1798.58]  but we are honored you are here
[1798.58 --> 1801.78]  and you are welcome to be here with us.
[1801.78 --> 1804.12]  And I would love for you to consider
[1804.12 --> 1806.74]  the Lord's invitation to you
[1806.74 --> 1808.46]  to put your trust in Him.
[1811.38 --> 1815.12]  So let's pray as we come now to this meal.
[1816.72 --> 1818.52]  God, our Father Almighty,
[1819.36 --> 1821.54]  maker of all things visible and invisible,
[1822.66 --> 1826.16]  Lord, would you take these visible elements of bread and the cup
[1826.16 --> 1828.68]  and would you set them apart to point
[1828.68 --> 1834.30]  to the invisible realities of our participation in Jesus.
[1835.68 --> 1838.12]  And Lord Jesus, it's your body that was broken,
[1838.30 --> 1840.18]  it is your blood that was shed
[1840.18 --> 1846.74]  in order to invite us into the very life of God,
[1847.38 --> 1848.92]  not on our terms,
[1849.58 --> 1852.10]  but completely based on what you have done for us.
[1853.52 --> 1856.72]  Holy Spirit, would you catch us up
[1856.72 --> 1858.16]  and would you lift us up
[1858.16 --> 1861.44]  to the throne of Jesus,
[1862.58 --> 1864.94]  seating us with Him at His table
[1864.94 --> 1867.88]  in the heavenly places right now
[1867.88 --> 1869.54]  by faith.
[1870.46 --> 1872.26]  And it is in His name that we pray.
[1872.80 --> 1873.22]  Amen.
[1875.00 --> 1876.36]  So brothers and sisters,
[1876.64 --> 1878.62]  the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed,
[1878.70 --> 1879.34]  He took bread.
[1879.86 --> 1881.40]  And when He gave thanks to God,
[1881.44 --> 1882.94]  He broke it and said,
[1882.94 --> 1884.24]  And this is my body,
[1884.64 --> 1885.46]  which is for you.
[1886.12 --> 1888.10]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1888.98 --> 1889.92]  In the same way,
[1889.98 --> 1890.60]  after supper,
[1890.70 --> 1891.56]  He took the cup,
[1891.70 --> 1891.98]  saying,
[1892.10 --> 1893.38]  This cup is the new covenant
[1893.38 --> 1894.72]  in my blood.
[1895.52 --> 1897.60]  Do this whenever you drink it
[1897.60 --> 1899.18]  in remembrance of me.
[1899.88 --> 1902.30]  For whenever you eat this bread
[1902.30 --> 1903.78]  and drink this cup,
[1904.12 --> 1905.64]  you proclaim the Lord's death
[1905.64 --> 1907.58]  until He comes again.
[1907.58 --> 1912.08]  So may I invite our elders
[1912.08 --> 1914.06]  to come forward
[1914.06 --> 1915.68]  to help me serve the elements.
[1915.68 --> 1915.84]  Thank you.
[1915.84 --> 1915.90]  Thank you.
[1937.58 --> 1967.56]  Thank you.
[1967.58 --> 1997.56]  Thank you.
[1997.58 --> 2027.56]  Thank you.
[2027.58 --> 2029.58]  Thank you.
[2029.58 --> 2057.56]  Thank you.
[2057.58 --> 2059.24]  Thank you.
[2059.24 --> 2061.58]  Thank you.
[2061.58 --> 2061.92]  Thank you.
[2063.58 --> 2065.58]  Thank you.
[2065.66 --> 2069.66]  Thank you.
[2070.22 --> 2070.80]  Thank you.
[2070.92 --> 2071.26]  Thank you.
[2071.36 --> 2071.90]  Thank you.
[2072.00 --> 2073.36]  Thank you.
[2073.36 --> 2075.36]  Amen.
[2103.36 --> 2113.28]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2133.36 --> 2163.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2163.36 --> 2193.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2193.36 --> 2223.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2223.34 --> 2228.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2228.34 --> 2233.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2233.34 --> 2239.34]  Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ, which is broken for you, let's eat together.
[2239.34 --> 2241.34]  Amen.
[2269.34 --> 2271.34]  Amen.
[2299.34 --> 2301.34]  Amen.
[2320.22 --> 2326.16]  Brothers and sisters, the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for the remission of all of our sins, let's drink together.
[2329.34 --> 2330.34]  Amen.
[2336.34 --> 2338.86]  Let's pray together and thank the Lord for this meal.
[2340.12 --> 2341.74]  O Lord, we give you praise.
[2342.40 --> 2344.66]  You are the God of mercy and of grace.
[2345.26 --> 2350.44]  You are the God who gives us hope in our hopelessness, who makes us whole when we are broken.
[2351.26 --> 2357.36]  And Lord, I pray for every single person here this morning, Lord, that you would have met us at this meal,
[2357.36 --> 2363.72]  that you would have invited us to know you more, to abide in your grace.
[2364.04 --> 2367.74]  And we thank you, Lord, for your spirit's work to help us to follow you.
[2368.72 --> 2372.36]  We thank you for all you've done, for the forgiveness of sins and the hope of glory.
[2372.56 --> 2373.62]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2373.96 --> 2374.22]  Amen.
[2374.22 --> 2374.30]  Amen.
[2375.96 --> 2384.86]  So today, we will not be having a children's message, but we are going to instead sing a song that hopefully the children will also enjoy.
[2385.32 --> 2386.36]  You are my all in all.
[2386.48 --> 2387.30]  So let's all stand.
[2387.46 --> 2388.20]  Let's sing together.
[2388.20 --> 2418.18]  Let's sing together.
[2418.20 --> 2448.18]  Let's sing together.
[2448.20 --> 2478.18]  Let's sing together.
[2478.20 --> 2508.18]  Let's sing together.
[2508.18 --> 2538.16]  Let's sing together.
[2538.18 --> 2540.18]  Let's sing together.
[2540.18 --> 2542.18]  Let's sing together.
[2542.18 --> 2544.18]  Let's sing together.
[2544.18 --> 2554.60]  Let's sing together.
[2554.60 --> 2556.00]  Let's sing together.
[2556.00 --> 2585.84]  It's not often I actually have to lower the mic.
[2586.00 --> 2588.82]  When I come up here, I usually have to lift it up.
[2591.52 --> 2599.46]  So today we are returning to our study in the book of Romans that we started back in the fall last year.
[2600.78 --> 2606.38]  And by way of just a very brief review, what is the book of Romans all about?
[2607.48 --> 2613.18]  Well, it was written by the Apostle Paul to the heart of the Roman Empire.
[2613.18 --> 2620.10]  And it was written about the heart of the matter, which is the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2620.24 --> 2622.64]  The book of Romans is all about the gospel.
[2623.74 --> 2634.72]  But before we get to the good news of the gospel, what Christ has done for us to secure for all of us a reconciled relationship with God our Heavenly Father,
[2634.72 --> 2639.52]  he has to deal with the bad news first.
[2640.14 --> 2649.64]  And it's very much like our Heidelberg Catechism, which begins with guilt before it then moves to grace and then gratitude.
[2650.64 --> 2654.62]  And so we are in kind of the section of what we call guilt,
[2654.62 --> 2660.10]  but we are going to be quickly moving on, even beginning next week, to the grace part.
[2660.74 --> 2663.48]  But first, let's read Romans chapter 3.
[2664.24 --> 2667.82]  So I invite you to turn there in your Bibles if you'd like.
[2667.82 --> 2676.22]  It's right after Acts.
[2679.66 --> 2685.56]  And we are in chapter 3, verses 9 through 20.
[2688.78 --> 2691.22]  It's on page 838 in your pre-Bible.
[2691.22 --> 2698.02]  So Romans chapter 3, we'll read verses 9 to 20.
[2699.06 --> 2700.74]  What shall we conclude then?
[2701.42 --> 2702.36]  Are we any better?
[2702.96 --> 2703.60]  Not at all.
[2704.34 --> 2709.06]  We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.
[2709.70 --> 2710.56]  As it is written,
[2711.20 --> 2713.10]  There is no one righteous, not even one.
[2713.54 --> 2716.26]  There is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.
[2716.90 --> 2719.56]  All have turned away, all have together become worthless.
[2719.56 --> 2722.82]  There is no one who does good, not even one.
[2723.80 --> 2725.40]  Their throats are open graves.
[2725.66 --> 2727.30]  Their tongues practice deceit.
[2727.96 --> 2730.20]  The poison of vipers is on their lips.
[2730.78 --> 2732.70]  Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
[2733.32 --> 2735.02]  Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[2735.58 --> 2737.46]  Ruin and misery mark their ways.
[2737.84 --> 2739.70]  In the way of peace they do not know.
[2740.12 --> 2742.78]  There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[2744.04 --> 2748.76]  Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law.
[2748.76 --> 2753.74]  So that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
[2754.70 --> 2760.84]  Therefore, no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law.
[2761.46 --> 2765.56]  Rather, through the law, we become conscious of sin.
[2766.84 --> 2768.00]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2768.00 --> 2769.58]  Thank you, God.
[2770.26 --> 2777.26]  So let's come before the Lord in a word of prayer as we pray for his blessing upon the reading and preaching of his word.
[2777.42 --> 2777.78]  Let's pray.
[2779.46 --> 2783.16]  Our Heavenly Father, we praise you this morning for your glory.
[2783.16 --> 2792.20]  And we ask that now as we turn to your word that you would give us the humility and the hunger that we need.
[2792.62 --> 2797.70]  So that your spirit would write your words upon our hearts.
[2798.22 --> 2802.00]  Lord, help us to see that in Christ alone our hope is found.
[2802.56 --> 2804.56]  To the praise of his glorious name.
[2805.08 --> 2805.38]  Amen.
[2805.38 --> 2816.90]  So there's a scene from the movie Shawshank Redemption where Andy Dufresne.
[2817.04 --> 2817.48]  Dufresne?
[2817.78 --> 2818.26]  Dufresne.
[2818.34 --> 2819.34]  Yeah, I was like working.
[2819.46 --> 2820.22]  How am I going to say this?
[2820.40 --> 2821.04]  Okay, Dufresne.
[2821.50 --> 2823.26]  It's not Dufresne or something.
[2823.52 --> 2823.90]  Dufresne.
[2824.26 --> 2825.32]  Okay, Andy Dufresne.
[2826.00 --> 2828.20]  He is escaping out of prison.
[2828.20 --> 2843.54]  He's crawling through this filthy sewer in the dark, in the rain, and he's almost to the end of the tunnel that leads to freedom to escape from the prison.
[2843.54 --> 2859.64]  And this first section of Romans from chapter 1, verse 18, all the way to chapter 3, verse 20, it's sort of this dark tunnel that we have to get through before we get to the freedom of the gospel.
[2859.64 --> 2874.00]  And there, you know, is so much amazing goodness in the book of Romans, but before that we have to crawl through this dark tunnel of these chapters that are all about our human predicament.
[2874.52 --> 2876.00]  Our human dilemma.
[2876.44 --> 2877.04]  Our sinfulness.
[2877.66 --> 2878.92]  Our unrighteousness.
[2879.18 --> 2881.80]  And the penalty that we deserve for our sin.
[2882.90 --> 2885.38]  And so, we are almost at the end of the tunnel.
[2886.06 --> 2887.06]  We're almost there.
[2887.06 --> 2896.38]  And as I said, next week, Paul is going to make a transition to start talking about the good news of God's provision of his grace to us in Jesus Christ.
[2897.12 --> 2899.70]  And we're going to talk about good news today as well.
[2900.30 --> 2905.20]  But we've got to climb through some cruddy stuff first.
[2906.16 --> 2913.88]  And in our passage today, Paul is really driving home the reality of our sinfulness.
[2913.88 --> 2918.90]  The reality of our unrighteousness before God.
[2920.00 --> 2928.88]  You know, and even though he has already talked for two chapters now about this, he is pressing the point even further.
[2930.10 --> 2936.68]  And so, you may be thinking, Paul, you're overstating your case.
[2936.94 --> 2939.16]  Have you ever had anybody overstate their case?
[2939.20 --> 2939.98]  Like, we get it.
[2940.28 --> 2941.62]  You know, okay, we're sinners.
[2941.78 --> 2942.18]  We get it.
[2942.18 --> 2942.98]  You can move on now.
[2945.14 --> 2946.74]  But do we really get it?
[2949.08 --> 2951.12]  Do we really get it?
[2951.76 --> 2957.94]  And I think Paul is on to something when he continues to press our sinfulness.
[2958.62 --> 2960.80]  Because we don't really get it.
[2961.44 --> 2963.46]  We don't really understand our sinfulness.
[2965.04 --> 2966.20]  But so what?
[2966.20 --> 2969.96]  Why is he pressing this point so much?
[2970.76 --> 2973.72]  It's because Paul is trying to empty our hands.
[2973.94 --> 2979.18]  So that we can then receive the gift of God's righteousness and his salvation.
[2979.94 --> 2980.40]  Right?
[2980.46 --> 2984.10]  That is why he is belaboring the point of our sin.
[2984.10 --> 2994.32]  Because he wants us to let go of any remaining hope that we might trust in our own righteousness or our own goodness.
[2994.32 --> 2997.52]  So maybe you've heard this illustration before.
[2998.00 --> 2999.14]  How to catch a monkey.
[3000.08 --> 3001.26]  Do you know how to catch a monkey?
[3002.70 --> 3004.14]  If you don't, I'll tell you.
[3004.44 --> 3005.56]  I've never done it myself.
[3005.94 --> 3010.14]  But I remember hearing this illustration, you know, from my pastor growing up.
[3011.20 --> 3013.06]  You know, monkeys can be really hard to catch.
[3013.66 --> 3014.48]  They're fast.
[3015.48 --> 3016.26]  They're small.
[3016.42 --> 3018.18]  They climb trees and jump from here to there.
[3019.12 --> 3021.32]  But there's a well-known trick that works really well.
[3021.48 --> 3027.64]  So to catch a monkey, what you have to do is put a hole into a coconut or into some sort of container.
[3028.24 --> 3029.84]  And then, of course, you know, tie that to a tree.
[3030.48 --> 3036.76]  And the hole has to be large enough for the monkey to put its hand to fit into the container.
[3036.76 --> 3043.34]  And then, you put a piece of fruit or some desirable object into the container.
[3043.76 --> 3052.68]  So that when the monkey reaches in to grab the fruit, they can't pull their hand out with their fist holding this object.
[3052.68 --> 3054.18]  And they can't get it out of the container.
[3056.14 --> 3056.74]  Right?
[3057.24 --> 3063.12]  So as long as they are holding onto the fruit, they can't escape.
[3064.06 --> 3066.58]  Now, what would you do to escape?
[3067.66 --> 3068.44]  Let go.
[3069.02 --> 3070.20]  But is that monkey going to let go?
[3070.94 --> 3071.36]  No.
[3072.12 --> 3079.48]  Even if it sees the danger of a hunter approaching, it is not scared enough to let go of the fruit and to escape.
[3079.86 --> 3081.72]  It's not willing to let go.
[3083.36 --> 3085.32]  And we are all like that monkey.
[3086.00 --> 3086.56]  Right?
[3087.04 --> 3096.00]  We, you know, we come before God holding on to our own righteousness, our own goodness in our hands.
[3096.00 --> 3101.82]  But as long as we are holding anything in our hands when we come to God, we remain enslaved to sin.
[3102.42 --> 3103.50]  We remain trapped.
[3103.94 --> 3104.82]  We remain in danger.
[3105.08 --> 3109.90]  And we cannot open our hands to then receive the free gift of God's righteousness.
[3109.90 --> 3114.00]  And so I think this is Paul's intention here.
[3114.36 --> 3116.18]  To empty our hands.
[3116.32 --> 3118.88]  Do you, do we really understand our own guilt?
[3119.58 --> 3124.68]  Do we really understand that we have nothing to hold on to to stand before a holy God?
[3124.68 --> 3128.34]  That is the main point that Paul is making here.
[3128.42 --> 3131.04]  So let's see how he does that in these verses.
[3131.90 --> 3136.10]  And the first point he makes is the predicament of sin.
[3136.68 --> 3138.98]  Just the human dilemma of our sin.
[3139.14 --> 3140.74]  And let's see what he says about it.
[3141.18 --> 3142.44]  So look with me at verse 9.
[3142.44 --> 3146.06]  So he begins, what shall we conclude then?
[3146.86 --> 3152.54]  So you see here that he's concluding an argument that he started way back in chapter 1, verse 18.
[3153.02 --> 3154.04]  So what should we conclude?
[3154.12 --> 3155.18]  He's going to wrap this up.
[3156.72 --> 3159.90]  Then he says, do we have any advantage?
[3160.42 --> 3161.50]  Not at all.
[3161.50 --> 3166.12]  So he's referring to what he had just said at the beginning of chapter 3.
[3166.94 --> 3171.94]  Where he said, you know, the Jews do have advantages.
[3172.44 --> 3173.78]  Much in every way.
[3174.66 --> 3176.54]  So is he contradicting himself here?
[3177.34 --> 3177.92]  Well, no.
[3178.52 --> 3183.64]  Because in salvation history, the Jews did have advantages.
[3184.26 --> 3184.48]  Right?
[3184.54 --> 3185.96]  They had the blessings of the covenant.
[3186.38 --> 3187.74]  They had the law.
[3187.88 --> 3189.10]  They were God's special people.
[3189.66 --> 3191.10]  But they broke the covenant.
[3191.10 --> 3192.36]  They disobeyed the law.
[3192.66 --> 3194.74]  And they worshipped other gods.
[3195.42 --> 3207.64]  And so Paul goes on and says, for we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.
[3208.82 --> 3215.14]  So in other words, Jews under the power of sin are no better off than Gentiles under the power of sin.
[3215.14 --> 3217.44]  Because we are all under the power of sin.
[3217.78 --> 3220.10]  Despite whatever advantages we had.
[3221.10 --> 3224.60]  But I want us to notice what he doesn't say here.
[3225.50 --> 3228.94]  Paul doesn't say that we commit sin.
[3229.64 --> 3232.76]  Just like as an occasional thing that we do.
[3232.96 --> 3233.86]  I mean, of course we do.
[3233.94 --> 3234.78]  That's not what he says.
[3235.44 --> 3237.76]  He doesn't even say that we are sinners.
[3238.18 --> 3239.84]  As if that is our main identity.
[3239.98 --> 3240.98]  That's not what he says.
[3241.86 --> 3245.02]  He says we are under the power of sin.
[3245.02 --> 3250.66]  The picture we should think of is that we are slaves.
[3251.48 --> 3251.72]  Right?
[3251.80 --> 3253.42]  And sin is our master.
[3253.94 --> 3255.14]  Sin tells us what to do.
[3255.98 --> 3257.54]  Sin is the one that controls us.
[3258.10 --> 3261.30]  We are under the power, the authority of sin.
[3261.30 --> 3261.34]  Sin.
[3262.42 --> 3264.80]  And so that's the first thing that we see here that Paul says.
[3264.86 --> 3266.20]  That is the predicament of sin.
[3266.24 --> 3269.34]  That we are all under the power of sin.
[3270.34 --> 3275.84]  Now the second thing Paul highlights is the extensiveness of sin.
[3276.58 --> 3276.80]  Right?
[3276.86 --> 3281.60]  And Paul had already, he just said, you know, neither Jew nor Gentile is any better off.
[3281.66 --> 3283.04]  We're all guilty before God.
[3283.04 --> 3286.60]  But he isn't satisfied with just making his own arguments.
[3286.94 --> 3290.78]  So he goes on to make his argument from scripture.
[3291.64 --> 3296.66]  So if you look at the beginning of verse 10, he says, as it is written.
[3297.64 --> 3306.72]  And then there's this litany of quotes that come from the Old Testament that are strung together like pearls strung together on a string.
[3307.94 --> 3311.12]  Just one after another after another.
[3311.12 --> 3314.48]  From verse 10 all the way down to verse 18.
[3315.34 --> 3317.98]  So Paul, he quotes from Ecclesiastes.
[3318.44 --> 3319.98]  He quotes from Isaiah.
[3320.28 --> 3322.68]  And he quotes from six different psalms.
[3323.50 --> 3325.98]  And this was a common rabbinic practice.
[3326.88 --> 3334.56]  And what you'll discover if you look up all of these references is that some of them refer to Jews in their original context in the Old Testament.
[3335.10 --> 3338.42]  Others refer to Gentiles in their original context.
[3338.42 --> 3344.40]  And what he's doing is showing that everybody is under the power of sin.
[3345.14 --> 3348.40]  So let's look at what he says here in verses 10 to 12.
[3349.42 --> 3355.02]  He says, as it is written, there is no one righteous, not even one.
[3356.30 --> 3359.16]  There is no one, verse 11, who understands.
[3359.46 --> 3361.52]  There is no one who seeks God.
[3361.52 --> 3364.78]  All have turned away.
[3365.04 --> 3367.18]  They have together become worthless.
[3367.34 --> 3372.42]  There is no one who does good, not even one.
[3372.42 --> 3381.56]  So Paul, right, beginning all the way back in chapter 1, verse 18, right, he's talked about how Gentiles are sinners.
[3382.38 --> 3385.30]  And then after that, he talked about how Jews are sinners.
[3385.62 --> 3389.28]  And now he's saying, yeah, everybody is a sinner.
[3389.78 --> 3391.56]  Everybody in the whole world is a sinner.
[3391.74 --> 3392.50]  That is his point.
[3392.50 --> 3400.82]  Now, sometimes it is easier for us to say, yes, everybody is a sinner.
[3401.30 --> 3406.84]  And we can make generalities about the sinfulness of all humanity.
[3407.68 --> 3413.42]  But it is a little bit more difficult for us to say, I am a sinner.
[3413.42 --> 3413.86]  Right?
[3414.70 --> 3417.72]  We have a hard time accepting our own sinfulness.
[3418.26 --> 3420.62]  And we might think, am I really that bad?
[3421.38 --> 3421.92]  Come on.
[3422.16 --> 3423.04]  Am I really that bad?
[3423.22 --> 3425.50]  Does this really apply to me?
[3427.04 --> 3433.48]  And so, you know what I do when I think about badness or about, you know, sin of the world or other people?
[3433.84 --> 3440.10]  I think of the evil dictator, right, who is committing, like, mass atrocities and suffering.
[3441.32 --> 3442.64]  That is a bad guy.
[3442.64 --> 3442.78]  I think of the evil guy.
[3443.18 --> 3444.60]  Clearly, Paul is talking about him.
[3445.52 --> 3447.92]  Or I think of my neighbor across the street.
[3448.02 --> 3449.16]  I'm not thinking about anybody in particular.
[3449.36 --> 3450.46]  But, you know, the neighbor.
[3450.70 --> 3453.50]  There's someone down there who, you know, that person is a bad guy.
[3454.38 --> 3455.92]  Or I think of my classmate.
[3456.30 --> 3457.56]  Or my coworker.
[3457.90 --> 3458.78]  Or whatever.
[3459.06 --> 3460.40]  These are the bad guys.
[3461.06 --> 3463.06]  These are the people who deserve God's judgment.
[3463.84 --> 3467.14]  But I never really think of myself as the bad guy.
[3467.38 --> 3467.58]  Right?
[3468.10 --> 3469.76]  I never really think I'm that bad.
[3469.76 --> 3482.78]  But the truth is, if we were to all plug our brains into this projector, and if we were to show all of the thoughts in our heads up here on the screen.
[3483.04 --> 3483.26]  Right?
[3483.26 --> 3487.38]  Even all the thoughts that came through your head before you came to church this morning.
[3488.18 --> 3490.80]  Or all the thoughts that ran through your head this last week.
[3492.24 --> 3494.46]  We would all cower in shame.
[3494.46 --> 3498.72]  We would all want to run out of this room.
[3499.40 --> 3503.98]  Because we would see, and everybody else would see, how bad we really are.
[3505.12 --> 3505.36]  Right?
[3505.44 --> 3508.82]  Just from the thoughts that go through our heads.
[3509.94 --> 3514.14]  And so it doesn't do us much good to compare ourselves to other people.
[3514.34 --> 3517.06]  Because God's standard is his perfect righteousness.
[3517.46 --> 3518.50]  His perfect holiness.
[3518.50 --> 3524.32]  And in light of who God is, none of us are righteous in his sight.
[3525.86 --> 3531.16]  And so Paul is driving home this pervasiveness, the extensiveness of sin.
[3531.28 --> 3535.66]  And his point is not so much that everyone is a sinner, but is that you are a sinner.
[3537.50 --> 3542.70]  And he's really hoping that his readers and us will get it.
[3542.98 --> 3545.44]  Will say, wait a second.
[3545.44 --> 3547.20]  Are you talking about me?
[3548.58 --> 3550.26]  And Paul says, yes.
[3550.92 --> 3552.78]  I'm glad we're on the same page now.
[3555.04 --> 3561.90]  So if I were to come face to face with the truth of the scriptures, I would read it like this.
[3562.28 --> 3565.70]  And I'm going to stick my name into what we just read.
[3566.40 --> 3570.62]  And maybe as I read, you can also stick your own name in here as well.
[3570.94 --> 3572.92]  So for me, this is how I would read it.
[3572.92 --> 3575.72]  Jason is not righteous.
[3576.74 --> 3578.48]  Jason does not understand.
[3579.02 --> 3580.50]  Jason does not seek God.
[3580.90 --> 3583.00]  Jason has turned aside.
[3583.58 --> 3584.82]  Jason has become worthless.
[3585.18 --> 3586.24]  Jason does no good.
[3588.30 --> 3589.42]  That's what Paul is saying.
[3589.52 --> 3591.16]  That's the truth about us.
[3593.38 --> 3596.00]  We are all under the power of sin.
[3596.00 --> 3602.70]  But before I move on, I want to consider one thing that he says here in verse 11.
[3603.88 --> 3607.80]  There is no one who seeks God.
[3609.80 --> 3614.40]  Because your objection might be, well, I know a lot of people who seek God.
[3615.20 --> 3615.38]  Right?
[3615.44 --> 3617.32]  I know a lot of spiritual people.
[3617.58 --> 3620.32]  I know people who go to religious services.
[3620.52 --> 3622.58]  I know people who go to church.
[3623.78 --> 3625.24]  Don't people seek God?
[3625.24 --> 3628.06]  Yes, of course people seek a God.
[3628.52 --> 3631.28]  People will seek a God of their own imaginations.
[3632.02 --> 3632.70]  That's what they do.
[3633.36 --> 3634.82]  They will seek false gods.
[3635.16 --> 3638.24]  They will seek anyone but the true and living God.
[3639.06 --> 3639.28]  Right?
[3639.34 --> 3643.54]  Because when you come face to face with the true and living God in your sin,
[3643.94 --> 3646.30]  he is not the God that you want to deal with.
[3647.54 --> 3649.32]  He is not the God you want to seek.
[3649.62 --> 3649.74]  Right?
[3649.74 --> 3653.00]  And so people would rather deal with the gods of their own imaginations,
[3653.36 --> 3655.06]  with the gods that they can manage,
[3655.28 --> 3658.64]  that they can bring down to their terms who agree with them,
[3659.12 --> 3661.32]  than to deal with the true God.
[3661.72 --> 3665.60]  People seek all kinds of gods, even in the church.
[3665.60 --> 3671.32]  But no one in our natural state of sin seeks after the true God.
[3672.06 --> 3673.46]  Like Adam and Eve in the garden,
[3674.60 --> 3677.44]  faced with our sin, we hide from God.
[3678.96 --> 3681.42]  Okay, so that's the, you know,
[3681.42 --> 3686.16]  we talked about the dilemma of our sin and the extensiveness of sin.
[3686.30 --> 3687.74]  It's, you know, every single person.
[3689.40 --> 3690.54]  Next, Paul goes on.
[3690.58 --> 3692.56]  He talks about the totality of sin.
[3693.26 --> 3696.04]  How bad is our sin really?
[3696.96 --> 3699.92]  Well, these pearls, right, of the Old Testament scriptures,
[3700.30 --> 3702.10]  of these truths about us,
[3702.68 --> 3707.44]  Paul, what he's doing is he's attacking our sense of self-righteousness.
[3707.44 --> 3712.32]  He's attacking any sense that we are, in fact, innocent.
[3713.34 --> 3715.06]  And there are three things that Paul mentions,
[3715.92 --> 3720.54]  just talking about the darkness of how being under the power of sin affects us.
[3720.64 --> 3722.92]  The darkness of how sin affects us.
[3723.50 --> 3728.94]  And the three things he mentions are our mind, our mouth, and our feet.
[3729.18 --> 3731.28]  We can kind of think of it in those categories.
[3731.48 --> 3735.98]  So first, he says sin affects our mind.
[3735.98 --> 3737.82]  So look again at verse 1.
[3738.28 --> 3739.68]  There is no one who understands.
[3739.82 --> 3741.40]  There is no one who seeks God.
[3742.52 --> 3744.06]  There's no one who understands.
[3745.68 --> 3749.24]  And so you see right here how God, even perhaps more than we do,
[3749.60 --> 3751.26]  he does value the mind.
[3752.18 --> 3752.38]  Right?
[3752.44 --> 3753.38]  Not just the heart,
[3753.88 --> 3757.18]  but he is concerned deeply about what people think.
[3757.52 --> 3761.22]  What we know and what we understand about God and ourselves in the world.
[3761.22 --> 3766.82]  And that is why Jesus said we're to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts,
[3766.94 --> 3771.18]  with all of our souls, with all of our minds, with all of our strength.
[3772.38 --> 3772.90]  Right?
[3772.96 --> 3777.02]  The mind, what you think, is really very important to God,
[3777.12 --> 3779.52]  as much as what proceeds from our hearts.
[3780.66 --> 3782.90]  And then secondly, he talks about our mouths.
[3782.90 --> 3787.14]  In verses 13 and 14, he says,
[3787.28 --> 3789.24]  Their throats are open graves.
[3789.64 --> 3791.54]  Their tongues practice deceit.
[3791.86 --> 3793.86]  The poison of vipers is on their lips.
[3794.18 --> 3797.60]  Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
[3799.04 --> 3804.22]  See, these are very vivid pictures of the darkness of sin and how it affects us.
[3804.74 --> 3805.96]  We speak death.
[3807.50 --> 3811.96]  Our words often deceive their words of poison.
[3812.92 --> 3817.24]  And in The Lord of the Rings, there's a character named Grima Wormtongue,
[3817.92 --> 3822.96]  who speaks these words of poison to control the king of Rohan.
[3824.14 --> 3827.36]  And to an extent, it is a picture of all of us.
[3827.92 --> 3833.18]  And how we will use our own words to control others, to harm others.
[3833.18 --> 3840.32]  And then notice, it's not just a matter of having darkened minds and having tongues that deceive,
[3840.90 --> 3843.54]  but notice it gets to the point of actual bloodshed.
[3844.14 --> 3847.68]  As our feet then carry us on these paths of sin.
[3848.32 --> 3849.88]  So verses 15 to 17,
[3849.88 --> 3852.74]  Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[3853.16 --> 3855.50]  Ruin and misery mark their ways.
[3855.74 --> 3857.88]  The way of peace they do not know.
[3858.84 --> 3859.04]  Right?
[3859.10 --> 3861.92]  So the direction that we choose to walk in,
[3862.10 --> 3863.06]  darkened by sin,
[3863.30 --> 3864.12]  is affected.
[3864.46 --> 3866.72]  And it leads to misery.
[3866.72 --> 3872.44]  And now, so why are people prepared to act so wickedly?
[3873.64 --> 3874.14]  Right?
[3874.18 --> 3879.26]  Why are we so quick to do and to say things that are so offensive to God?
[3879.26 --> 3882.86]  And it really comes down to verse 18.
[3883.84 --> 3887.02]  Because there is no fear of God before their eyes.
[3888.02 --> 3888.56]  Right?
[3888.64 --> 3893.82]  The fear of God is the soul and substance of godliness.
[3893.98 --> 3898.48]  Without fear of God, people sin against God and sin against one another.
[3899.92 --> 3903.78]  And so Paul's point here is that every single part of us,
[3904.48 --> 3908.26]  our minds, our hearts, our mouths, our feet,
[3908.26 --> 3910.14]  every part of us is affected by sin.
[3910.22 --> 3913.06]  There's not a single part of us that we can trust
[3913.06 --> 3917.86]  to be not affected and enslaved to sin.
[3920.38 --> 3923.48]  And so we might read these verses that we just read and say,
[3923.66 --> 3928.56]  you know, wow, he is really describing a really bad person.
[3930.10 --> 3930.58]  No.
[3931.26 --> 3932.96]  He's describing everyone.
[3934.18 --> 3934.66]  Everyone.
[3934.84 --> 3935.42]  That's what he said.
[3935.50 --> 3936.72]  Every single one of us.
[3936.72 --> 3941.40]  And so we need to understand that when we experience anger,
[3942.18 --> 3947.24]  that's the seed of murder and bloodshed, Jesus says.
[3948.10 --> 3952.72]  That when we experience lust, that is the seed of adultery,
[3953.18 --> 3955.72]  if fully grown without intervention.
[3956.52 --> 3958.98]  When we experience covetousness,
[3959.50 --> 3962.22]  that full-blown leads to stealing,
[3962.68 --> 3964.40]  if not intervened upon.
[3964.40 --> 3967.82]  And so just like an acorn grows into an oak tree,
[3968.14 --> 3971.46]  the seed of sin grows into all of this that Paul just said.
[3971.90 --> 3974.14]  Apart from the grace of God, this is what happens.
[3975.20 --> 3976.98]  And so let's consider this for a moment.
[3977.82 --> 3978.98]  If that is the case,
[3979.02 --> 3983.04]  if what Paul has said here actually describes all of us,
[3983.04 --> 3984.04]  you're not in jail.
[3984.04 --> 3984.98]  And yet,
[3984.98 --> 3987.08]  here we sit.
[3988.20 --> 3988.76]  Meaning,
[3989.00 --> 3990.28]  you're not in jail.
[3991.40 --> 3993.18]  You are not on death row.
[3994.14 --> 3996.62]  You haven't completely ruined your life.
[3997.22 --> 3997.48]  Why?
[3998.72 --> 4000.08]  Because of the grace of God.
[4000.08 --> 4005.56]  He has kept you from doing these things.
[4006.96 --> 4009.54]  So all of us, under the power of sin,
[4009.60 --> 4015.02]  are completely capable of doing all that Paul has described in these passages.
[4015.76 --> 4018.78]  But usually, we're not as bad as all of that.
[4018.78 --> 4025.86]  And the reason is because God clearly restrains most people by his common grace.
[4026.50 --> 4033.36]  He restrains most of us from carrying out the full effects of the sin and the darkness that is in our hearts.
[4033.36 --> 4037.62]  But the reality is, unless the scriptures are lying,
[4038.08 --> 4045.56]  is that every single one of us sitting here has that sin in us that could lead to death row.
[4046.44 --> 4048.86]  Or to jail a thousand times over.
[4049.70 --> 4052.62]  All of us are capable of adultery.
[4054.14 --> 4055.20]  Of murder.
[4056.18 --> 4056.96]  Of stealing.
[4057.34 --> 4058.48]  Of sexual abuse.
[4058.98 --> 4060.42]  Of blowing up buildings.
[4060.68 --> 4061.46]  Of drug abuse.
[4061.46 --> 4062.52]  Whatever it is.
[4062.52 --> 4065.06]  Because we are capable of it.
[4065.14 --> 4068.46]  Because of the perversity of sin.
[4069.48 --> 4071.06]  That is in our hearts.
[4072.26 --> 4073.30]  And yet, here we are.
[4073.88 --> 4075.54]  Because God has preserved you.
[4075.74 --> 4076.90]  You didn't preserve yourself.
[4077.26 --> 4078.68]  God is preserving you.
[4082.38 --> 4083.90]  And we need to realize that.
[4084.96 --> 4087.32]  And we need to thank God for that.
[4087.96 --> 4092.32]  That it's his grace that keeps us from sin taking its full authority.
[4092.52 --> 4093.06]  In us.
[4093.06 --> 4093.96]  In us.
[4093.96 --> 4095.04]  And through us.
[4095.20 --> 4097.66]  Bringing ruin to ourselves and to the world.
[4097.66 --> 4105.68]  And so, Paul, he gives us the exhibition of what it means to be a human under the power, the control of sin,
[4105.98 --> 4108.32]  apart from the grace of God.
[4108.32 --> 4112.22]  And then he has an implication of that reality.
[4112.22 --> 4116.56]  And that is the implication of all this is that we are inexcusable.
[4116.56 --> 4120.56]  We have no excuse to come for our sin before God.
[4120.96 --> 4122.88]  So look with me at verse 19.
[4122.88 --> 4124.86]  It says,
[4124.86 --> 4129.36]  Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law,
[4129.86 --> 4134.08]  so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
[4134.84 --> 4140.54]  Now you might think, whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law.
[4141.06 --> 4143.36]  And you might think, well, that refers to the Jews only.
[4143.36 --> 4152.82]  But then notice he says, so that every mouth may be silenced in the whole world held accountable to God.
[4152.94 --> 4154.22]  Jew and Gentile.
[4155.16 --> 4159.18]  So whether you are a Jew or a Gentile, you are still under the law.
[4159.18 --> 4167.40]  And because you are unrighteous, and because you are what is described here, you are without excuse.
[4168.26 --> 4172.78]  There is nothing that we can do or say when we stand before God.
[4173.72 --> 4176.04]  So imagine this as an illustration.
[4176.46 --> 4177.46]  Imagine a playground.
[4178.24 --> 4181.82]  And imagine the kids are out there on the playground.
[4182.10 --> 4183.06]  They're having a good time.
[4183.48 --> 4184.02]  They're playing.
[4184.32 --> 4186.18]  But a fight breaks out.
[4186.18 --> 4192.06]  And you've got five boys who are ganging up on one other boy.
[4192.76 --> 4194.26]  And they start teasing him.
[4194.94 --> 4197.26]  And they start, you know, taunting him.
[4197.30 --> 4198.94]  And maybe some punches are thrown.
[4199.30 --> 4202.48]  And the teacher on the playground sees what's happening.
[4202.68 --> 4204.94]  And he sends them all to the principal's office.
[4205.12 --> 4208.98]  And the principal says, what do you boys have to say for yourselves?
[4211.16 --> 4213.28]  And there is complete silence.
[4213.28 --> 4221.72]  There is nothing that any of them could say because it was obvious that none of them could defend themselves.
[4222.54 --> 4223.04]  Right?
[4223.08 --> 4225.54]  It was obvious that they were all in the wrong.
[4227.02 --> 4230.36]  That is our situation before God.
[4231.12 --> 4232.96]  That's the scenario that we find ourselves in.
[4233.12 --> 4238.58]  That, you know, that when we stand before God, there is going to be all this evidence that is against us.
[4238.58 --> 4241.06]  And it all points to our guilt.
[4241.60 --> 4249.06]  And everything that we have ever said or done or thought or failed to say, do or think, we're going to have to give an account.
[4250.24 --> 4252.98]  God will essentially say, what do you have to say for yourselves?
[4253.08 --> 4254.96]  And our mouths will be silenced.
[4255.92 --> 4259.10]  There's nothing we could say in our defense.
[4259.10 --> 4262.22]  And that is why Paul goes on in verse 20.
[4262.86 --> 4268.54]  And he says, therefore, no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law.
[4269.04 --> 4273.16]  Rather, through the law, we become conscious of sin.
[4275.66 --> 4281.94]  No one will be able to justify themselves before God because the law, it just highlights our sin.
[4281.94 --> 4282.94]  Right?
[4283.72 --> 4289.28]  If there was no law against bullying other kids in school, those boys wouldn't have been in trouble.
[4290.20 --> 4295.26]  But there is a law, and therefore their sin is exposed, and they are guilty.
[4296.54 --> 4299.94]  But friends, what happens in the Christian faith?
[4300.72 --> 4302.02]  What happens in the Christian faith?
[4302.20 --> 4308.92]  Well, in the Christian faith, what happens is, not just that we recognize that no one is righteous, no, not one.
[4308.92 --> 4313.86]  But we also recognize that there was one who was righteous.
[4314.72 --> 4316.62]  There was one who was righteous.
[4317.84 --> 4324.48]  There is one who does not fit this description in Romans 3, and that is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4325.58 --> 4329.74]  And when Jesus went to Golgotha, when he hung on that cross,
[4330.54 --> 4335.04]  Jesus was taking all of that guilt upon himself.
[4335.04 --> 4339.36]  And you know how when I did that thing where I said,
[4339.48 --> 4343.00]  Jason is unrighteous, Jason does not see God?
[4343.08 --> 4344.78]  Well, what happened on the cross is this.
[4345.58 --> 4348.42]  Jesus was declared to be unrighteous.
[4349.74 --> 4354.96]  Jesus was declared to have a throat that is an open grave.
[4356.84 --> 4362.80]  Jesus was declared to be the one whose feet are swift to shed blood.
[4362.80 --> 4371.72]  Jesus was declared to have no way of peace and no fear of God before his eyes.
[4372.68 --> 4377.54]  That is what it means for him to be on the cross for your sin.
[4378.78 --> 4382.74]  That he was declared to be the greatest sinner who ever lived,
[4383.28 --> 4387.50]  so that you could be declared righteous in God's sight.
[4387.50 --> 4389.60]  And that's the gospel.
[4390.54 --> 4390.74]  Right?
[4390.82 --> 4396.40]  Taking us who are the worst and making us to be the very best in God's sight,
[4396.48 --> 4398.02]  the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[4398.48 --> 4403.90]  And taking Jesus who is the best and making him to be the worst,
[4404.40 --> 4406.54]  so that he might take the wrath of God,
[4406.90 --> 4409.70]  the punishment that we deserve for our sin, upon himself.
[4409.70 --> 4413.40]  And until we understand how sinful we really are,
[4413.62 --> 4415.24]  how terrible our sin is,
[4415.44 --> 4419.44]  we'll never understand how incredible it is that God loves us,
[4419.84 --> 4421.02]  and that he forgives us,
[4421.08 --> 4425.88]  and that he has set us free from the darkness of our sin.
[4426.88 --> 4428.24]  And so in the Shawshank Redemption,
[4429.56 --> 4432.52]  Andy Dufresne,
[4432.52 --> 4435.34]  I really did need help,
[4436.04 --> 4438.38]  crawls through that filthy sewer,
[4438.78 --> 4441.00]  and at last he makes it out,
[4441.62 --> 4442.64]  and he makes it to freedom.
[4444.00 --> 4445.78]  And that is the Christian.
[4446.62 --> 4448.82]  Not in our natural state of sin,
[4449.12 --> 4453.30]  but covered in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[4454.28 --> 4455.14]  Let's pray.
[4458.28 --> 4460.18]  Lord, we thank you for your word.
[4460.18 --> 4464.26]  And we pray that you would bless your word to our hearts,
[4464.62 --> 4465.82]  and to our minds,
[4466.16 --> 4467.12]  and to our feet,
[4467.50 --> 4468.28]  and to our mouths,
[4468.64 --> 4474.46]  so that we would see ourselves not as maybe sinners,
[4474.98 --> 4476.06]  or pretend sinners,
[4476.40 --> 4477.24]  or half sinners,
[4477.52 --> 4478.74]  or maybe not all that bad,
[4479.52 --> 4480.88]  but as real sinners.
[4482.94 --> 4485.58]  But that we are, because of Christ,
[4485.86 --> 4489.02]  sinners saved by amazing grace.
[4490.18 --> 4492.60]  And all for the sake of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[4493.36 --> 4494.52]  We pray in his name.
[4495.10 --> 4495.38]  Amen.
[4498.64 --> 4499.14]  All right.
[4499.16 --> 4500.52]  Let's get ready to stand,
[4500.88 --> 4503.06]  and we will sing a song of response.
[4503.06 --> 4514.68]  Aaron 18,
[4514.68 --> 4516.28]  friend,
[4516.28 --> 4530.34]  You're my God, my God bless, knowing here I find my best.
[4530.34 --> 4543.88]  And without you I fall apart, you're the one that guides my heart.
[4543.88 --> 4552.24]  Lord, I need you, Lord, I need you.
[4552.24 --> 4563.32]  Every hour I need you, my wrong defense, my righteousness.
[4563.32 --> 4568.72]  Oh God, Lord, I need you.
[4568.72 --> 4578.04]  Where sin runs deep, your grace is warm.
[4578.04 --> 4584.12]  Where grace is found is where you are.
[4584.12 --> 4590.00]  And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[4590.00 --> 4595.44]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[4595.44 --> 4601.62]  Where you are, Lord, I am free.
[4602.62 --> 4607.76]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[4607.76 --> 4615.08]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[4615.08 --> 4617.08]  Holiness was Christ in me.
[4617.08 --> 4618.90]  Holiness was Christ in me.
[4618.90 --> 4623.76]  In a background image was sent nerede.
[4623.76 --> 4629.80]  And with that, God is sent kauпа, in a sky in a sky in a sky in a sky in a sky.
[4629.80 --> 4633.92]  God, all I need is.
[4637.18 --> 4642.90]  So teach my song to Christ to you.
[4643.26 --> 4646.62]  When temptation comes, I will be.
[4648.04 --> 4651.96]  And when I cannot stand, I will fall in.
[4654.06 --> 4657.26]  Jesus, you are God and stay.
[4657.26 --> 4662.00]  And when I cannot stand, I will fall in.
[4664.40 --> 4667.86]  Jesus, you are my hope and stay.
[4671.94 --> 4674.30]  Lord, I need you.
[4674.44 --> 4678.32]  Oh, I need you.
[4678.78 --> 4684.04]  Every hour I need you.
[4684.04 --> 4689.28]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[4690.10 --> 4694.32]  Oh God, how I need you.
[4695.52 --> 4697.96]  Lord, I need you.
[4698.18 --> 4702.04]  Oh, I need you.
[4702.04 --> 4708.10]  Every hour I need you.
[4708.10 --> 4713.78]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[4714.86 --> 4719.10]  Oh God, how I need you.
[4719.10 --> 4726.16]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[4726.16 --> 4732.10]  Oh God, how I need you.
[4732.10 --> 4749.40]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[4749.80 --> 4751.90]  Any wellness, my goodness.
[4751.90 --> 4752.52]  How I need you.
[4752.52 --> 4758.16]  So this week's offering is for Regent College, and as you can see behind me there,
[4758.70 --> 4762.54]  Regent College is a local school of theology that was founded in 1968.
[4763.76 --> 4767.70]  A few of our members here are also affiliated with Regent in the past,
[4767.70 --> 4775.12]  and yeah, it's just a great theological college that provides schooling for folks looking to get into ministry
[4775.12 --> 4779.40]  and just to learn more about God, so please give generously as you're able.
[4782.52 --> 4812.50]  Thank you.
[4812.52 --> 4814.52]  Thank you.
[4814.52 --> 4815.52]  Thank you.
[4815.52 --> 4817.52]  Thank you.
[4817.52 --> 4820.52]  Thank you.
[4820.52 --> 4823.52]  Thank you.
[4823.52 --> 4826.52]  Thank you.
[4826.52 --> 4828.52]  Thank you.
[4828.52 --> 4831.52]  Thank you.
[4831.52 --> 4833.52]  Thank you.
[4833.52 --> 4836.52]  Thank you.
[4836.52 --> 4838.52]  Thank you.
[4838.52 --> 4840.52]  Amen.
[4868.52 --> 4870.52]  Amen.
[4898.52 --> 4904.10]  Before we come to God in prayer, we have one item of praise that I'd like to share.
[4904.38 --> 4909.78]  One of our members, Hans Verhoef, is celebrating his 95th birthday on Tuesday.
[4910.92 --> 4917.90]  So Hans and Sylvia are not able to regularly attend anymore, but they have been using the live stream to join with us.
[4918.12 --> 4922.22]  So we'll be thanking God as a congregation for that blessing.
[4922.84 --> 4925.08]  And with that, let's come to God in prayer.
[4928.52 --> 4933.24]  Heavenly Father, as we bow to you this morning, we thank you for your many blessings.
[4934.26 --> 4943.82]  Though ours is a broken world marred by sin, it is also beautiful and filled with loving, caring, selfless people that seek to do good in the world.
[4944.84 --> 4947.44]  Glory and praise be your name.
[4948.60 --> 4953.36]  Today we celebrate with Hans and Sylvia as they are about to mark Hans' 95th birthday.
[4953.36 --> 4961.98]  We thank you for his many years here on earth, that he could know you and be a blessing to all around him and a servant of your kingdom.
[4963.06 --> 4969.22]  We thank you too for the many baptisms and professions of faith that we have heard in the church over the last few weeks.
[4969.78 --> 4976.80]  As they grow in the knowledge of their Lord and Savior, may we be a blessing to them in turn.
[4976.80 --> 4981.64]  Help us as a congregation to be welcoming and encouraging to them.
[4982.72 --> 4988.18]  This morning we also ask you to be with Jason and Kayla as Kayla nears her due date in the coming weeks.
[4988.74 --> 4990.48]  Grant them everything they stand in need of.
[4991.12 --> 4996.98]  And again, may we as a congregation be both there for encouragement and support.
[4996.98 --> 5000.30]  All blessings come from you, Lord.
[5000.90 --> 5007.58]  You have given us your word that we may know you and fully glorify and worship you, for you alone are worthy.
[5008.82 --> 5014.94]  May what we have heard here today and every Sunday shape us and change us and bring about your kingdom.
[5015.68 --> 5024.42]  We long for a new heaven and a new earth where we can walk daily with you, our Lord, free from our enslavement to sin.
[5024.42 --> 5030.56]  Indeed, despite all the many blessings, we still live in a broken world.
[5031.30 --> 5038.26]  Because of our neglect, our climate is warming and forest fires are destroying homes in Los Angeles in the middle of winter.
[5039.08 --> 5043.68]  Our world has become fractured and over the last few years it has gotten worse.
[5044.64 --> 5049.88]  Once again, Europe is home to bloodshed and war like nothing we have seen since the Second World War.
[5049.88 --> 5055.88]  Africa is seeing coups and civil wars and bloodshed on a scale we cannot imagine.
[5056.44 --> 5059.14]  And it seems to have no beginning and no ends.
[5059.90 --> 5065.14]  We look upon the hatred and the callous disregard for human life and we weep.
[5065.14 --> 5075.64]  So, we pray in earnest for our world leaders and indeed for the warlords and tyrants who more than anyone are responsible for this wickedness.
[5076.38 --> 5081.72]  Turn them from evil or indifference and grant them wisdom to do what is right.
[5082.52 --> 5090.40]  May their actions bring about prosperity, not just for the countries they rule, but also for their neighbours and across the world.
[5090.40 --> 5094.78]  Above all, may they rule with justice and peace.
[5095.84 --> 5102.20]  King of kings, may your kingdom come and your will be done.
[5103.48 --> 5108.82]  At home, we pray for the many members of our congregation that are suffering from ill health.
[5108.82 --> 5126.98]  This morning, we pray in particular for Pat, Ellie, Grace, Jerry, Shirley, Eileen, Diane, Hank and Liz, Ted and Tony.
[5128.34 --> 5136.30]  We also pray, especially this morning, for Al DeBoer's twin brother, John, who is in hospital with severe health issues.
[5136.30 --> 5145.52]  We ask you, Lord, be with the doctors, grant them wisdom and grant John comfort and healing and peace.
[5146.36 --> 5147.86]  Draw near to him, Lord.
[5149.14 --> 5153.82]  Loving and ever-present God, hear our prayer.
[5154.86 --> 5158.42]  You are a God that suffers with us and for us.
[5159.08 --> 5161.10]  You walk beside each one of us.
[5161.10 --> 5166.56]  You call us your children, children of the one true living God.
[5166.96 --> 5168.94]  And you fill us up with your spirit.
[5169.62 --> 5172.06]  May we always look to you when we struggle.
[5173.08 --> 5179.80]  All these requests we present to you, almighty God, and in the name of Jesus, by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[5180.70 --> 5180.96]  Amen.
[5180.96 --> 5188.46]  I think at this point, I'd like to invite Jason back up to bring us our benediction, if I've got that right.
[5199.60 --> 5200.50]  Please stand.
[5200.50 --> 5207.88]  And I was asked also to pray for a blessing upon our food that we're about to enjoy.
[5208.60 --> 5213.82]  And so also, so do come and, you know, for our soup and bun lunch.
[5214.42 --> 5218.42]  And I'd encourage you to try to sit with someone you don't know as well.
[5219.48 --> 5222.64]  Maybe not necessarily your family or maybe a couple families together.
[5222.64 --> 5223.34]  That would be great.
[5223.34 --> 5227.60]  Don't forget to congratulate Doug and Eileen again and their membership.
[5228.42 --> 5230.06]  And let me pray for the food.
[5230.68 --> 5232.40]  And then we'll give the benediction.
[5233.42 --> 5237.48]  Lord, we thank you for this meal that we're about to enjoy together, of soup and buns.
[5238.24 --> 5241.86]  And Lord, would we enjoy the fellowship that we share in Christ even more.
[5242.64 --> 5246.38]  And Lord, we bless you and we thank you for your blessings upon us.
[5246.46 --> 5247.46]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[5247.64 --> 5247.94]  Amen.
[5248.82 --> 5251.36]  I invite you to hold out your hands and receive the Lord's blessing.
[5251.36 --> 5263.50]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither heights nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
[5264.00 --> 5269.00]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is ours in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[5269.48 --> 5269.80]  Amen.
[5281.36 --> 5283.42]  Amen.
[5283.56 --> 5284.28]  Amen.
[5284.28 --> 5285.48]  Amen.
[5285.48 --> 5286.12]  Amen.
[5286.12 --> 5290.24]  A few Alsations desist sins from the Lord's blessing for the things, or I am convinced that truth is not a sinful fool.
[5290.24 --> 5290.98]  Bareness with a said-ophile good man.
[5290.98 --> 5292.20]  Sacred members with a extra-end efforts with a receivedí's guest, the generous ministrin king of God.
[5292.20 --> 5294.82]  Hold upon us and ail foods with a chance to await us.
[5294.82 --> 5295.92]  Fat Huang of God, join us.
[5295.92 --> 5304.70]  Rede compassionate and spirit of God.
[5304.70 --> 5305.80]  Do not eat any thoughts?
[5305.80 --> 5306.38]  Do not meet us in the middle household, but in the face of the world another olurs are merely full.
[5306.38 --> 5308.18]  of прошлым position to dare us which is Hai.
[5308.18 --> 5314.50]  All in one, righteous and forgiving.
[5315.66 --> 5323.96]  No need's done, God's in God, there is no need.
[5325.32 --> 5334.96]  Praise the Lord, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, and the Lord.
[5334.96 --> 5344.92]  Praise the King of glory, praise the Lord for eternity.
[5346.00 --> 5355.48]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, and the Lord.
[5355.48 --> 5365.48]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord for eternity.
[5365.48 --> 5366.90]  So today.
[5366.90 --> 5368.90]  Amen.
[5396.90 --> 5398.90]  Amen.
[5426.90 --> 5428.90]  Amen.
[5456.90 --> 5458.90]  Amen.
[5486.90 --> 5488.90]  Amen.
