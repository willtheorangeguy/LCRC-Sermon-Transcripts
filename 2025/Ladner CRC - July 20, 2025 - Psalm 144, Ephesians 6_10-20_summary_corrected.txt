• The psalmist expresses trust in God despite humanity's weakness and mortality.

• The Bible passage of Ephesians 6 is referenced, where Paul writes about putting on the full armour of God to stand against spiritual forces of evil.

• The cosmic conflict between good and evil is a central theme in scripture
• This conflict begins in Genesis and continues throughout the Bible, including in the stories of Cain and Abel, Babel, Pharaoh against Moses, Goliath against David, Babylon against Jerusalem, Herod against Jesus, and the Pharisees against Jesus
• The conflict is not limited to individuals, but also includes the church, which is described as being built on a rock that will withstand the gates of hell
