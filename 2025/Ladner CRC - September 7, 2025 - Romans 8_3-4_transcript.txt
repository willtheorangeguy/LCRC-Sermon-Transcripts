[3223.22 --> 3227.12]  She wasn't smart
[3227.12 --> 3234.38]  A way to see to see
[3234.38 --> 3238.02]  The most and dear
[3238.02 --> 3244.68]  To see a God of grace
[3244.68 --> 3248.30]  He changed the heart
[3248.30 --> 3250.20]  My best friend
[3250.20 --> 3254.70]  My God to see
[3254.70 --> 3259.18]  The most and dear
[3259.18 --> 3263.04]  My God to see
[3263.04 --> 3266.48]  The most and dear
[3266.48 --> 3270.28]  My God to see
[3270.28 --> 3273.10]  The most and dear
[3284.70 --> 3290.32]  The Lord has promised
[3290.32 --> 3293.04]  To see
[3293.04 --> 3295.48]  His word
[3295.48 --> 3299.04]  My hope so close
[3299.04 --> 3302.18]  Be well
[3302.18 --> 3304.52]  My shield
[3304.52 --> 3307.04]  And portion
[3307.04 --> 3315.38]  My God to see
[3315.38 --> 3317.38]  The most and dear
[3317.38 --> 3321.72]  My God to see
[3321.72 --> 3323.92]  The most and dear
[3323.92 --> 3325.72]  My God to see
[3325.72 --> 3327.72]  The most and dear
[3327.72 --> 3329.72]  My God to see
[3329.72 --> 3334.20]  The most and dear
[3334.20 --> 3335.10]  The most and dear
[3335.10 --> 3336.64]  Jesus
[3336.64 --> 3340.58]  I am
[3340.58 --> 3370.56]  Thank you.
[3370.58 --> 3400.56]  Thank you.
[3400.58 --> 3402.58]  Go Astros.
[3403.46 --> 3406.58]  Watch your ears.
[3407.66 --> 3408.52]  Go Astros.
[3408.52 --> 3417.06]  May be seated.
[3425.20 --> 3428.64]  And so our children are dismissed to their Sunday school classes,
[3429.10 --> 3433.08]  and our Chinese brothers and sisters are dismissed to their worship service.
[3438.52 --> 3468.50]  Thank you.
[3468.52 --> 3470.52]  Thank you.
[3479.16 --> 3484.00]  Okay, so we are continuing our study in the book of Romans.
[3484.20 --> 3488.22]  We've been in Romans for almost a year now, walking through it passage by passage,
[3488.22 --> 3491.48]  and we at last have arrived in Romans chapter 8.
[3492.38 --> 3499.64]  And I mentioned last week, as we began Romans 8, that it is often said to be the greatest chapter ever written.
[3500.70 --> 3505.66]  And there are many people who have spoken of Romans 8 in this way.
[3506.58 --> 3513.36]  And so actually, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote or composed an entire cantata based on Romans 8.
[3514.94 --> 3521.44]  And then N.T. Wright, a New Testament scholar, had this quote to say.
[3521.44 --> 3523.98]  So this is what he says about Romans 8.
[3523.98 --> 3528.84]  It's a feast of Pauline themes that carries the gospel in every breath.
[3529.86 --> 3537.42]  If the church could hoist its sails and catch this wind, there's no knowing what might happen.
[3537.42 --> 3541.50]  So I think it's a wonderful image.
[3541.86 --> 3550.54]  And that is my prayer for us, that as we slowly explore the riches of Romans 8 over the coming weeks,
[3550.54 --> 3555.82]  that we as a church would hoist our sails and that we would catch the wind of the gospel,
[3555.98 --> 3560.78]  that we would catch the wind of what the Holy Spirit is doing in the gospel,
[3560.78 --> 3563.30]  and what he continues to do in our lives.
[3563.82 --> 3569.08]  And actually, the Holy Spirit is really the main theme, the main focus of Romans 8.
[3569.86 --> 3574.44]  So turn with me in your Bibles, if you haven't already, to Romans 8.
[3574.44 --> 3577.30]  That's on page 841 in your pew Bible.
[3578.70 --> 3580.54]  We'll also have the scripture on the screen.
[3581.40 --> 3583.46]  But if you want to follow along, it's on page 841.
[3585.08 --> 3589.90]  And last week we read verses 1 to 2, but we'll today read verses 1 to 4,
[3589.90 --> 3591.02]  so we have the context.
[3591.14 --> 3592.50]  We'll focus on verses 3 to 4.
[3593.28 --> 3597.32]  So let's hear God's word beginning in chapter 8, verse 1.
[3598.60 --> 3603.84]  Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[3604.60 --> 3611.02]  because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.
[3611.68 --> 3616.14]  For what the law was powerless to do, in that it was weakened by the sinful nature,
[3616.14 --> 3623.16]  God did by sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful man, to be a sin offering.
[3623.90 --> 3626.26]  And so he condemned sin in sinful man,
[3626.84 --> 3631.62]  in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us,
[3631.88 --> 3636.76]  who do not live according to the sinful nature, but according to the Spirit.
[3637.70 --> 3638.94]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3638.94 --> 3645.44]  So let's pray, and let's ask for God's blessing as we come before his word together.
[3646.92 --> 3652.62]  Our Heavenly Father, we praise you again this morning for your glory, for your majesty.
[3653.40 --> 3655.64]  And we also, Lord, thank you for your word.
[3656.44 --> 3658.60]  And we ask now, as we turn to your word,
[3658.60 --> 3665.28]  that you would give us the humility and the hunger that we need,
[3665.36 --> 3669.54]  so that your Holy Spirit would write your words in our hearts.
[3669.60 --> 3673.08]  And we ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3675.16 --> 3682.88]  So I'm sure many of you have had this experience of teaching a child how to ride a bike.
[3683.92 --> 3687.56]  Or maybe you were the child, and someone taught you how to ride a bike.
[3687.56 --> 3690.48]  Now, when my daughter Ellie was little,
[3690.80 --> 3695.96]  right outside of the front door of the apartment that we were living in was a little park.
[3696.06 --> 3697.58]  And this is a really little park.
[3697.68 --> 3700.44]  There were a couple trees, a couple bushes, a bench.
[3701.40 --> 3705.68]  And there was a paved road that, you know, circled this park.
[3705.80 --> 3709.74]  But it was a road that cars didn't really drive on,
[3709.82 --> 3714.64]  and so it was actually a perfect place for my daughter Ellie to learn how to ride a bike.
[3714.64 --> 3720.72]  And so the day came when she wanted to learn how to ride without training wheels,
[3720.80 --> 3722.42]  as that day often comes.
[3723.56 --> 3726.84]  And so what I did, and I don't know if this was the right thing,
[3727.38 --> 3732.92]  but what I did to help her was I would hold on to the handlebars with one hand
[3732.92 --> 3737.18]  and the back seat, the seat of her bike with the other hand,
[3737.18 --> 3744.44]  and I would jog beside her to help her to learn how to balance and how to pedal.
[3746.02 --> 3747.54]  And you know what?
[3748.28 --> 3752.88]  Even though I was running beside her and even though I was helping her,
[3754.30 --> 3756.56]  she was riding the bike, right?
[3756.56 --> 3759.96]  I mean, her legs were moving, she was pedaling,
[3760.48 --> 3767.18]  and yet her father was running along beside her and holding on, right?
[3767.22 --> 3771.82]  And so in that way, she's involved, she's riding the bike, she's sitting, she's pedaling.
[3772.24 --> 3775.48]  I'm involved, holding on, running with her.
[3775.72 --> 3776.82]  And so we're both involved.
[3777.52 --> 3779.74]  And she is actually riding the bike.
[3780.70 --> 3785.10]  Now, could she do it without me at that stage?
[3785.26 --> 3786.12]  No, she couldn't.
[3786.22 --> 3790.38]  Like, if she couldn't do it on her own, in her own strength,
[3790.44 --> 3792.98]  if I let go, she probably would have just wobbled and crashed.
[3793.60 --> 3796.74]  But with her father running along with her and helping her,
[3797.00 --> 3797.92]  she could do it.
[3798.04 --> 3799.18]  She could ride the bike.
[3800.86 --> 3804.72]  Now, you see, the reason I'm telling you about this
[3804.72 --> 3808.62]  is because living the Christian life is a little bit like that.
[3808.62 --> 3810.92]  You know, so no analogy is perfect.
[3811.40 --> 3814.18]  But the Christian life is a little bit like that.
[3814.92 --> 3818.86]  And so it's not the case of God jumping on the bike,
[3818.98 --> 3821.34]  and where we get off, and we say,
[3821.44 --> 3823.30]  well, you know, hey, I like it like this.
[3823.38 --> 3824.42]  God does it for me.
[3824.92 --> 3827.22]  God is going to do the biking for me.
[3828.44 --> 3830.66]  That's not what the Christian life is about.
[3831.28 --> 3833.10]  It's also not, though, also saying,
[3833.20 --> 3834.48]  God, I don't need your help.
[3834.90 --> 3835.96]  You know, I can do it.
[3836.04 --> 3837.04]  I can do it by myself.
[3837.04 --> 3841.58]  And it's not that at all as well.
[3842.74 --> 3845.90]  The Christian life is you're able to ride the bike
[3845.90 --> 3847.78]  because God is helping you.
[3848.52 --> 3851.06]  So you are riding, and God is helping,
[3851.36 --> 3852.98]  and you are both involved.
[3854.48 --> 3856.70]  And so now as we keep that idea in our minds,
[3856.76 --> 3858.32]  let's take a look at these verses.
[3858.88 --> 3863.72]  Because really this is a section on the Christian life.
[3863.72 --> 3866.00]  It's a section on sanctification.
[3866.90 --> 3868.42]  And I have two points for us this morning
[3868.42 --> 3869.98]  that come from our text.
[3870.48 --> 3872.12]  First, we're going to see in verse 3
[3872.12 --> 3875.42]  what God has done for us in Jesus Christ.
[3875.88 --> 3877.06]  And then in verse 4,
[3877.26 --> 3880.82]  we're going to see what God continues to do in us
[3880.82 --> 3882.18]  through the Holy Spirit.
[3882.68 --> 3884.94]  Okay, so what God does for us in Christ,
[3885.06 --> 3888.00]  and then what God does in us through the Holy Spirit.
[3888.00 --> 3890.56]  So the first one, what God has done for us in Christ.
[3891.76 --> 3894.58]  And let's remember what Paul has said already, right?
[3894.66 --> 3897.84]  In verse 1 of chapter 8, Paul says,
[3898.20 --> 3900.78]  there is now no condemnation
[3900.78 --> 3903.18]  for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[3903.72 --> 3903.90]  Right?
[3903.94 --> 3905.66]  And that's an amazing verse.
[3905.78 --> 3907.72]  It's a verse a lot of us have maybe even memorized,
[3908.18 --> 3910.46]  and we spent a lot of time on that last week.
[3910.82 --> 3913.78]  There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[3913.78 --> 3916.22]  But now the question is, well, why?
[3916.32 --> 3918.14]  Why is there no condemnation?
[3919.08 --> 3922.02]  And Paul gives us the answer in verse 2,
[3922.08 --> 3923.66]  but also especially here in verse 3.
[3923.88 --> 3925.02]  So let's have a look at verse 3.
[3926.20 --> 3926.74]  He says,
[3927.24 --> 3930.20]  For what the law was powerless to do,
[3930.68 --> 3932.92]  because it was weakened by the flesh,
[3933.48 --> 3934.94]  God did.
[3936.06 --> 3939.96]  And really, I love it when the Bible says that,
[3940.04 --> 3940.80]  God did.
[3941.04 --> 3942.32]  Because that's the gospel right there.
[3942.62 --> 3943.26]  God did.
[3943.26 --> 3945.06]  We couldn't do, but God did.
[3946.20 --> 3950.98]  See, God has done for us what his own law couldn't do.
[3951.86 --> 3953.06]  And so we might want to ask then,
[3953.12 --> 3954.82]  well, what couldn't the law do?
[3955.42 --> 3958.80]  And the answer is, the law couldn't give life.
[3959.64 --> 3960.98]  Okay, the law couldn't give life.
[3962.10 --> 3965.32]  God gave the law as the means by which
[3965.32 --> 3968.14]  he entered into a covenant relationship with his people.
[3968.88 --> 3971.56]  And in keeping the law, by obeying God's law,
[3971.56 --> 3974.58]  we would experience life in him,
[3974.58 --> 3975.84]  in relationship with him.
[3976.48 --> 3978.38]  But the law couldn't do that.
[3979.28 --> 3981.54]  And it's not that God's law was the problem.
[3981.62 --> 3985.32]  The problem was our own deep down weakness.
[3986.02 --> 3986.16]  Right?
[3986.24 --> 3988.48]  Always failing to measure up
[3988.48 --> 3991.88]  to God's righteous requirements for us in the law.
[3991.88 --> 3995.38]  So kind of thinking back to our analogy,
[3995.66 --> 3997.84]  there is a law of riding a bike.
[3998.48 --> 3998.60]  Right?
[3998.70 --> 3999.96]  I mean, I don't understand it,
[4000.00 --> 4001.28]  but there's like physics involved,
[4001.42 --> 4002.68]  there's motion, there's all this stuff.
[4002.74 --> 4004.04]  There's laws of riding a bike.
[4004.62 --> 4007.24]  And so the law says, okay, this is how it works.
[4007.28 --> 4008.30]  You balance, you pedal.
[4008.90 --> 4010.98]  If you just obey those laws,
[4011.42 --> 4012.48]  you can ride the bike.
[4012.48 --> 4015.62]  But we can't do it.
[4015.70 --> 4015.88]  Right?
[4015.96 --> 4017.14]  In the example of my daughter.
[4017.60 --> 4019.26]  And it's not the law's fault.
[4019.34 --> 4021.14]  We don't say, oh, stupid laws of biking.
[4022.22 --> 4022.46]  Right?
[4022.74 --> 4025.16]  It's because of our own weakness.
[4025.28 --> 4027.36]  We can't obey the law.
[4028.24 --> 4029.82]  Now, the wonderful thing is,
[4029.86 --> 4031.50]  the whole point of the gospel is,
[4032.22 --> 4034.78]  that God is not defeated by our weakness.
[4035.38 --> 4035.52]  Right?
[4035.62 --> 4036.90]  We, in our weakness,
[4037.00 --> 4039.60]  to not live up to the requirements of the law,
[4039.60 --> 4042.22]  don't foil God's plans,
[4042.22 --> 4043.98]  where God is now not able to do anything.
[4044.20 --> 4046.04]  But rather, God acts.
[4047.22 --> 4049.38]  And so, what does God do?
[4050.08 --> 4051.52]  Let's keep reading in verse 3.
[4053.14 --> 4053.62]  He says,
[4053.78 --> 4058.04]  God did, by sending his own son in the likeness
[4058.04 --> 4060.02]  of sinful flesh,
[4060.50 --> 4061.72]  to be a sin offering.
[4062.34 --> 4066.88]  And so, he condemned sin in the flesh.
[4066.88 --> 4071.40]  Now, isn't that an interesting way
[4071.40 --> 4074.90]  that Paul describes our Lord Jesus Christ?
[4075.02 --> 4075.78]  Where he says,
[4076.38 --> 4079.14]  in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[4079.20 --> 4083.50]  And now, there's been a lot of commentary about that.
[4083.66 --> 4084.42]  A lot of, you know,
[4084.72 --> 4087.46]  theologians who wrestle with this.
[4088.00 --> 4089.24]  And so, what does it mean,
[4089.30 --> 4090.90]  in the likeness of sinful flesh?
[4091.74 --> 4093.72]  Well, it's actually quite simple.
[4093.72 --> 4096.82]  It's a very kind of delicate way
[4096.82 --> 4098.24]  of the Apostle Paul
[4098.24 --> 4101.74]  where he is capturing the true humanity
[4101.74 --> 4103.06]  of Jesus Christ,
[4103.30 --> 4104.72]  and yet, at the same time,
[4104.78 --> 4105.86]  not calling him a sinner.
[4106.52 --> 4108.66]  So, Jesus was truly man,
[4109.60 --> 4110.58]  and yet, he was,
[4110.92 --> 4113.32]  he did not have a sinful nature like us.
[4114.18 --> 4114.98]  So, in other words,
[4115.08 --> 4117.42]  Jesus came into our world
[4117.42 --> 4119.38]  as an ordinary human being,
[4119.42 --> 4120.80]  like us in every way,
[4120.80 --> 4123.72]  yet, not weakened like us,
[4123.90 --> 4127.48]  not corrupted like us by sin.
[4128.60 --> 4130.56]  And so, God sent his own divine son
[4130.56 --> 4132.52]  to enter into our broken world,
[4132.60 --> 4133.34]  to become a man,
[4133.42 --> 4134.62]  to live among us.
[4135.34 --> 4135.74]  Why?
[4136.76 --> 4139.40]  To be a sin offering.
[4140.00 --> 4140.92]  To be a sin offering.
[4141.62 --> 4141.74]  Right?
[4141.80 --> 4143.10]  So, when Jesus died on the cross,
[4143.14 --> 4143.92]  in that moment,
[4144.44 --> 4146.58]  God was judging and condemning
[4146.58 --> 4149.82]  all sin in Jesus.
[4151.12 --> 4152.44]  See, Jesus became
[4152.44 --> 4154.56]  our sinful weakness,
[4154.74 --> 4155.74]  personified,
[4156.44 --> 4158.34]  and God judged sin
[4158.34 --> 4159.48]  there in our Savior.
[4160.60 --> 4162.82]  He condemned all the sin of the world,
[4162.90 --> 4163.44]  the evil,
[4164.10 --> 4164.58]  the sin,
[4164.70 --> 4165.42]  the rebellion,
[4165.94 --> 4168.92]  all gathered onto Christ,
[4169.10 --> 4170.22]  and on the cross,
[4170.42 --> 4171.30]  he condemned it.
[4171.30 --> 4174.68]  And so, what Paul is doing
[4174.68 --> 4176.12]  is he's evoking
[4176.12 --> 4177.74]  this Old Testament imagery
[4177.74 --> 4178.56]  and ideas
[4178.56 --> 4181.20]  where God's people
[4181.20 --> 4181.88]  in the Old Testament,
[4182.16 --> 4183.60]  they couldn't keep the law,
[4184.12 --> 4185.68]  so God had a way
[4185.68 --> 4186.84]  that he could still
[4186.84 --> 4187.80]  be their God
[4187.80 --> 4188.26]  and they,
[4188.66 --> 4189.36]  his people,
[4189.94 --> 4191.32]  through the sacrificial system.
[4192.00 --> 4193.76]  Where the sins of the people
[4193.76 --> 4195.48]  were placed onto the animal,
[4196.06 --> 4197.06]  the sacrificial animal,
[4197.24 --> 4198.58]  and the priest would slit
[4198.58 --> 4199.88]  the throat of the animal,
[4199.88 --> 4201.80]  and the blood would pour out.
[4202.94 --> 4204.20]  And so that the sins
[4204.20 --> 4204.78]  of the people
[4204.78 --> 4205.66]  could be atoned for.
[4206.04 --> 4206.90]  And that they could then
[4206.90 --> 4207.98]  remain in covenant
[4207.98 --> 4209.46]  relationship with God.
[4210.62 --> 4212.24]  And this is a picture,
[4212.38 --> 4213.84]  it's a very graphic picture,
[4214.48 --> 4215.74]  of a substitute
[4215.74 --> 4218.02]  being our sin offering.
[4219.12 --> 4219.84]  And Paul says
[4219.84 --> 4220.82]  that this very graphic
[4220.82 --> 4221.96]  Old Testament image
[4221.96 --> 4223.70]  is what Jesus did
[4223.70 --> 4224.62]  for us on the cross.
[4225.52 --> 4225.62]  Right?
[4225.68 --> 4226.48]  That when Jesus
[4226.48 --> 4227.66]  was hanging on the cross,
[4227.86 --> 4228.96]  and when his blood
[4228.96 --> 4230.50]  was pouring out from him,
[4230.66 --> 4232.04]  he was our substitute.
[4233.10 --> 4234.02]  He took
[4234.02 --> 4235.92]  all of our sin
[4235.92 --> 4236.84]  upon himself,
[4236.84 --> 4238.12]  and he took
[4238.12 --> 4238.86]  our punishment.
[4239.36 --> 4240.32]  So then God
[4240.32 --> 4241.02]  could look at us
[4241.02 --> 4241.38]  and say,
[4241.58 --> 4243.46]  no condemnation.
[4244.94 --> 4245.38]  So friends,
[4245.44 --> 4246.32]  what does that mean for you?
[4247.28 --> 4248.62]  What it means for you
[4248.62 --> 4250.32]  is that if you are
[4250.32 --> 4250.88]  a Christian,
[4251.16 --> 4251.82]  it means that
[4251.82 --> 4253.86]  all of your worst flaws,
[4254.42 --> 4256.06]  and all of your worst failures,
[4256.18 --> 4257.18]  and all of your sin,
[4257.18 --> 4258.32]  all of the things
[4258.32 --> 4259.40]  that you are ashamed of,
[4259.58 --> 4260.36]  all of the things
[4260.36 --> 4262.40]  that you want to keep secret,
[4263.40 --> 4265.48]  all of that
[4265.48 --> 4267.16]  has already been
[4267.16 --> 4268.08]  dealt with
[4268.08 --> 4269.48]  on the cross.
[4269.60 --> 4270.48]  It's dealt with.
[4271.76 --> 4273.14]  So that you are now
[4273.14 --> 4273.64]  declared
[4273.64 --> 4274.92]  righteous.
[4275.58 --> 4276.64]  You are declared
[4276.64 --> 4277.34]  blameless
[4277.34 --> 4278.22]  in the sight of God
[4278.22 --> 4278.64]  forever.
[4279.20 --> 4280.56]  And that is as true
[4280.56 --> 4281.78]  on your best day
[4281.78 --> 4283.64]  as on your worst day.
[4283.64 --> 4286.38]  And I heard
[4286.38 --> 4287.00]  another preacher
[4287.00 --> 4288.24]  once put it this way,
[4288.54 --> 4289.08]  that God
[4289.08 --> 4290.26]  does not love you
[4290.26 --> 4291.44]  to the degree
[4291.44 --> 4292.18]  that you are
[4292.18 --> 4293.08]  like Christ.
[4293.76 --> 4294.68]  He loves you
[4294.68 --> 4295.40]  to the degree
[4295.40 --> 4296.16]  that you are
[4296.16 --> 4297.06]  in Christ.
[4297.62 --> 4298.54]  And that is always
[4298.54 --> 4299.60]  100%
[4299.60 --> 4300.60]  if you are a Christian.
[4301.10 --> 4302.52]  If you are in Christ,
[4303.28 --> 4304.34]  God loves you
[4304.34 --> 4305.70]  100% completely
[4305.70 --> 4306.78]  as much
[4306.78 --> 4307.64]  on your best day
[4307.64 --> 4309.00]  as on your worst day.
[4309.00 --> 4313.60]  Now, you can see why,
[4313.76 --> 4313.90]  you know,
[4313.96 --> 4314.52]  and this, friends,
[4314.60 --> 4315.40]  this is the gospel.
[4315.82 --> 4317.30]  And you can see why
[4317.30 --> 4318.98]  this might have been
[4318.98 --> 4320.04]  a bit of a problem
[4320.04 --> 4321.62]  for the church
[4321.62 --> 4324.04]  in the medieval church
[4324.04 --> 4325.10]  before the Reformation.
[4326.38 --> 4328.08]  When Johann Tetzel,
[4328.20 --> 4329.26]  he was going around,
[4329.34 --> 4330.88]  if you know your history a bit,
[4331.08 --> 4331.82]  he was going around
[4331.82 --> 4333.32]  selling indulgences.
[4333.44 --> 4334.16]  And what does that mean?
[4334.58 --> 4335.38]  He would basically
[4335.38 --> 4336.80]  sell forgiveness of sin.
[4336.86 --> 4337.56]  So it's not about
[4337.56 --> 4338.66]  that Christ,
[4338.66 --> 4339.90]  there's no condemnation
[4339.90 --> 4340.48]  in Christ
[4340.48 --> 4341.96]  because he was a sacrifice.
[4342.30 --> 4342.80]  But rather,
[4342.94 --> 4343.64]  you kind of have to
[4343.64 --> 4344.66]  offer your own sacrifice.
[4344.84 --> 4345.60]  So you pay
[4345.60 --> 4348.24]  and you buy an indulgence
[4348.24 --> 4349.34]  and then you can be forgiven.
[4350.94 --> 4351.88]  And therefore,
[4352.06 --> 4352.64]  spend less time
[4352.64 --> 4353.20]  in purgatory.
[4353.32 --> 4354.14]  So this is the way
[4354.14 --> 4354.98]  that it was understood.
[4356.06 --> 4357.00]  And so this guy Tetzel,
[4357.08 --> 4358.14]  he was a really clever guy.
[4359.18 --> 4360.60]  But there was a guy
[4360.60 --> 4362.34]  who was even more clever
[4362.34 --> 4364.26]  than Tetzel.
[4364.62 --> 4365.74]  Because this guy,
[4365.74 --> 4367.12]  he comes to buy
[4367.12 --> 4368.24]  some indulgences
[4368.24 --> 4369.38]  so that he could
[4369.38 --> 4370.14]  have his sins forgiven.
[4370.64 --> 4371.74]  And he says to Tetzel,
[4371.80 --> 4372.52]  well, Johann,
[4372.96 --> 4374.24]  I'm just wondering,
[4374.36 --> 4374.50]  you know,
[4374.56 --> 4376.16]  people are buying indulgences
[4376.16 --> 4377.02]  for things that they
[4377.02 --> 4377.88]  have already done
[4377.88 --> 4379.12]  so that they can be forgiven.
[4380.20 --> 4380.88]  But, you know,
[4380.94 --> 4381.74]  I'm probably going to
[4381.74 --> 4382.70]  commit a sin in the future.
[4382.94 --> 4384.18]  So can I just, like,
[4384.24 --> 4385.32]  buy an indulgence
[4385.32 --> 4386.62]  for a future sin right now
[4386.62 --> 4387.36]  so I don't have to
[4387.36 --> 4388.10]  go find you later?
[4388.80 --> 4389.70]  And Tetzel's like,
[4390.26 --> 4390.66]  yeah,
[4390.98 --> 4391.94]  this is brilliant.
[4392.06 --> 4393.06]  Of course you can.
[4393.06 --> 4395.80]  And so this guy buys
[4395.80 --> 4396.84]  from,
[4396.98 --> 4398.00]  gives Tetzel some money
[4398.00 --> 4399.36]  for an indulgence
[4399.36 --> 4400.08]  that he will commit
[4400.08 --> 4401.82]  for a future sin.
[4402.40 --> 4403.58]  And so Tetzel rides off
[4403.58 --> 4404.10]  in this horse
[4404.10 --> 4405.40]  with this big bag full of money
[4405.40 --> 4406.50]  because he sold
[4406.50 --> 4407.56]  all these indulgences.
[4408.12 --> 4409.72]  And so what does that guy do?
[4410.68 --> 4413.34]  He goes and he robs Tetzel.
[4415.80 --> 4416.28]  See?
[4416.64 --> 4417.46]  Very clever.
[4417.46 --> 4420.98]  But, friends,
[4421.12 --> 4421.98]  that's not how
[4421.98 --> 4423.00]  Christianity works.
[4423.94 --> 4424.08]  Right?
[4424.68 --> 4425.26]  For one,
[4425.40 --> 4427.00]  you don't have to do anything
[4427.00 --> 4429.62]  to earn God's approval,
[4429.92 --> 4432.10]  earn approval before God
[4432.10 --> 4433.76]  because Christ has done it for us.
[4434.06 --> 4436.58]  He paid that penalty of sin.
[4436.70 --> 4438.84]  He atoned for God
[4438.84 --> 4439.86]  in your place
[4439.86 --> 4440.74]  as a substitute,
[4441.14 --> 4442.74]  took the penalty upon himself.
[4444.24 --> 4445.64]  So that's all done with,
[4445.70 --> 4446.90]  but now it also changes
[4446.90 --> 4447.66]  the way you live.
[4447.72 --> 4448.92]  Like, you don't have
[4448.92 --> 4450.12]  this forgiveness in your pocket
[4450.12 --> 4451.30]  and then just go and sin
[4451.30 --> 4453.10]  like this kind of clever guy did.
[4453.76 --> 4454.44]  But rather,
[4454.58 --> 4455.78]  not only do you have
[4455.78 --> 4456.32]  the forgiveness
[4456.32 --> 4458.08]  of the grace of God
[4458.08 --> 4460.04]  which has dealt with your sin,
[4460.54 --> 4462.08]  but we also now also
[4462.08 --> 4463.56]  receive the Holy Spirit
[4463.56 --> 4465.58]  who now comes
[4465.58 --> 4466.74]  and lives in us
[4466.74 --> 4469.16]  and who runs alongside of us
[4469.16 --> 4470.94]  helping us live
[4470.94 --> 4471.98]  the Christian life.
[4472.94 --> 4473.68]  And that leads us
[4473.68 --> 4474.64]  just to our second
[4474.64 --> 4475.88]  and final point this morning,
[4475.88 --> 4477.36]  which is
[4477.36 --> 4478.96]  what God is doing now
[4478.96 --> 4479.64]  in us
[4479.64 --> 4480.62]  through the Spirit.
[4480.90 --> 4481.68]  Because it's not like,
[4481.78 --> 4482.88]  okay, no condemnation,
[4483.46 --> 4483.74]  you know,
[4483.86 --> 4484.26]  that's it,
[4484.32 --> 4484.76]  see you later.
[4485.26 --> 4485.84]  But no,
[4485.92 --> 4487.18]  now there's the Christian life.
[4487.86 --> 4488.04]  Okay,
[4488.08 --> 4488.66]  the Christian life
[4488.66 --> 4489.48]  of sanctification,
[4490.04 --> 4491.16]  of maturing
[4491.16 --> 4491.90]  in holiness
[4491.90 --> 4492.80]  and in faith,
[4493.28 --> 4494.10]  and this is the work
[4494.10 --> 4494.74]  of the Holy Spirit
[4494.74 --> 4495.54]  within us as well.
[4495.88 --> 4497.10]  So let's look at verse 4,
[4497.82 --> 4498.54]  and this is what Paul
[4498.54 --> 4499.40]  continues to say.
[4500.36 --> 4501.48]  In order that,
[4501.58 --> 4502.08]  so, you know,
[4502.18 --> 4503.72]  no condemnation,
[4504.16 --> 4505.44]  Jesus died as a sin offering.
[4505.88 --> 4506.16]  Why?
[4506.56 --> 4507.62]  In order that,
[4508.02 --> 4508.70]  see the thing is,
[4508.74 --> 4509.06]  the Bible,
[4509.22 --> 4509.32]  you know,
[4509.48 --> 4510.54]  Paul gives us the answers.
[4510.78 --> 4511.62]  Sometimes it's very easy.
[4512.30 --> 4513.26]  In order that,
[4513.26 --> 4514.80]  the righteous requirement
[4514.80 --> 4515.38]  of the law
[4515.38 --> 4517.04]  might be fully met in us
[4517.04 --> 4518.06]  who do not live
[4518.06 --> 4519.14]  according to the flesh
[4519.14 --> 4520.60]  but according to the Spirit.
[4520.60 --> 4524.52]  Paul is saying,
[4525.08 --> 4527.66]  before we received the Spirit,
[4527.76 --> 4529.26]  before we were baptized
[4529.26 --> 4531.70]  and united to Christ by faith,
[4531.78 --> 4532.44]  before that,
[4533.12 --> 4535.62]  we could not fulfill
[4535.62 --> 4536.74]  the righteous requirements
[4536.74 --> 4537.32]  of the law
[4537.32 --> 4538.38]  because of our sinful,
[4538.70 --> 4539.84]  our weakness of our flesh.
[4540.38 --> 4541.38]  But now,
[4542.02 --> 4543.44]  because of the Holy Spirit
[4543.44 --> 4544.38]  dwelling within us,
[4544.46 --> 4546.52]  we can fulfill
[4546.52 --> 4548.18]  the righteous requirements
[4548.18 --> 4549.54]  of the law.
[4550.60 --> 4553.54]  Did you know that?
[4554.70 --> 4555.10]  Like,
[4555.16 --> 4557.26]  when I was studying that this week,
[4557.30 --> 4557.70]  I was like,
[4558.06 --> 4558.36]  oh,
[4558.88 --> 4559.78]  I mean,
[4559.80 --> 4561.00]  I kind of learned something new.
[4561.08 --> 4561.26]  I mean,
[4561.34 --> 4561.52]  yeah,
[4561.58 --> 4562.30]  maybe I knew that
[4562.30 --> 4562.74]  but like,
[4563.10 --> 4564.04]  this came home to me
[4564.04 --> 4564.60]  in a new way.
[4565.68 --> 4566.96]  That as a Christian,
[4567.20 --> 4568.16]  you fulfill
[4568.16 --> 4569.52]  the righteous requirements
[4569.52 --> 4570.06]  of the law.
[4570.54 --> 4571.34]  That's what Paul is saying.
[4572.50 --> 4573.24]  And to be honest,
[4573.36 --> 4574.14]  that's not the way
[4574.14 --> 4575.18]  I often think about
[4575.18 --> 4576.14]  my relationship
[4576.14 --> 4577.02]  with the requirements
[4577.02 --> 4577.56]  of the law.
[4578.24 --> 4579.14]  It's much easier for me
[4579.14 --> 4579.46]  to say,
[4579.46 --> 4580.62]  the requirements
[4580.62 --> 4581.18]  of the law.
[4581.28 --> 4581.42]  Yeah,
[4581.50 --> 4581.72]  well,
[4581.90 --> 4583.26]  I know I fail that.
[4583.76 --> 4584.96]  I know I fall short.
[4586.10 --> 4586.88]  But that's not what
[4586.88 --> 4587.44]  Paul says here.
[4589.16 --> 4590.40]  And he's not the only one
[4590.40 --> 4591.04]  who says this.
[4591.16 --> 4591.92]  So listen here,
[4591.96 --> 4592.34]  I'm going to share
[4592.34 --> 4593.30]  a couple verses with you.
[4594.24 --> 4594.66]  James,
[4594.82 --> 4595.36]  chapter 4,
[4595.96 --> 4596.56]  chapter 2,
[4596.58 --> 4596.94]  verse 8.
[4597.68 --> 4598.48]  What does he say?
[4599.02 --> 4600.06]  If you really keep
[4600.06 --> 4601.00]  the royal law
[4601.00 --> 4601.70]  found in Scripture,
[4601.88 --> 4602.38]  love your neighbor
[4602.38 --> 4603.06]  as yourself,
[4603.14 --> 4604.02]  you are doing right.
[4604.02 --> 4606.84]  So,
[4606.96 --> 4608.26]  what's James saying?
[4608.68 --> 4609.70]  Does James know
[4609.70 --> 4610.42]  that we are sinners?
[4611.60 --> 4611.90]  Yes,
[4611.96 --> 4612.44]  he does.
[4613.36 --> 4615.30]  But he also says,
[4615.54 --> 4616.58]  if you keep the law,
[4616.76 --> 4617.62]  you're doing right.
[4619.14 --> 4620.22]  What does that mean?
[4620.76 --> 4621.94]  It means that,
[4622.02 --> 4622.54]  very simply,
[4622.74 --> 4623.96]  that God accepts
[4623.96 --> 4627.36]  even our weakened efforts
[4627.36 --> 4629.44]  in keeping the law,
[4629.44 --> 4630.62]  and he bestows
[4630.62 --> 4631.56]  on those efforts
[4631.56 --> 4632.32]  the title
[4632.32 --> 4634.02]  of fulfillment.
[4635.54 --> 4637.46]  He takes our weakened efforts
[4637.46 --> 4638.74]  to love God
[4638.74 --> 4639.50]  and love our neighbor
[4639.50 --> 4640.98]  and as we do that
[4640.98 --> 4641.80]  and the Holy Spirit
[4641.80 --> 4642.70]  helping us do that,
[4642.78 --> 4643.30]  he says,
[4643.96 --> 4644.46]  approved.
[4644.82 --> 4645.20]  He says,
[4645.40 --> 4645.88]  fulfilled.
[4646.78 --> 4647.58]  You've done it.
[4649.70 --> 4650.62]  So basically,
[4651.96 --> 4652.28]  you know,
[4652.74 --> 4654.00]  he will say to us
[4654.00 --> 4656.16]  that we have been holy
[4656.16 --> 4657.70]  and blameless
[4657.70 --> 4659.44]  and righteous.
[4661.20 --> 4661.54]  And so,
[4662.02 --> 4662.72]  consider this.
[4662.76 --> 4663.42]  Here's a question.
[4664.78 --> 4665.90]  True or false,
[4666.42 --> 4667.14]  true or false,
[4667.66 --> 4669.04]  Christians have a pure heart.
[4671.74 --> 4672.82]  True or false,
[4673.04 --> 4674.28]  Christians have a pure heart.
[4675.50 --> 4675.74]  Now,
[4675.76 --> 4676.74]  before you answer that,
[4676.86 --> 4678.42]  think about what Jesus taught
[4678.42 --> 4679.26]  in the Sermon on the Mount.
[4679.96 --> 4681.08]  What did Jesus say
[4681.08 --> 4682.38]  in Matthew 5,
[4682.50 --> 4682.86]  verse 8?
[4684.08 --> 4685.56]  Blessed are the pure in heart,
[4685.64 --> 4686.58]  for they will see God.
[4688.30 --> 4688.44]  Right?
[4688.56 --> 4688.84]  And so,
[4688.90 --> 4689.54]  the very fact
[4689.54 --> 4690.34]  that you are here,
[4690.56 --> 4691.78]  that you came into these doors
[4691.78 --> 4692.28]  this morning,
[4692.48 --> 4694.56]  that you have sung praises to God,
[4694.72 --> 4696.04]  that you've opened your Bible,
[4696.36 --> 4697.56]  that you've bowed your heads,
[4697.94 --> 4699.26]  and to the extent
[4699.26 --> 4700.02]  that you did that
[4700.02 --> 4701.16]  with sincere faith,
[4702.02 --> 4703.18]  you are saying before God,
[4703.30 --> 4704.26]  I have a pure heart.
[4705.40 --> 4705.84]  Right?
[4705.92 --> 4706.64]  Who may ascend
[4706.64 --> 4707.36]  the hill of the Lord
[4707.36 --> 4708.92]  and stand in his holy place?
[4709.24 --> 4710.16]  Those who have
[4710.16 --> 4711.82]  a pure heart.
[4712.42 --> 4712.96]  Psalm 24.
[4714.48 --> 4714.92]  So,
[4715.02 --> 4716.08]  do you have a pure heart?
[4716.08 --> 4716.68]  Yes.
[4716.68 --> 4717.08]  Do you have a pure heart?
[4717.42 --> 4717.84]  Yes.
[4718.80 --> 4719.42]  Claim it.
[4720.54 --> 4720.80]  Yes,
[4720.84 --> 4721.14]  you do.
[4722.30 --> 4723.18]  True or false,
[4723.30 --> 4724.08]  Christians are righteous.
[4726.32 --> 4728.02]  Look at Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[4728.20 --> 4728.98]  how they are described
[4728.98 --> 4729.76]  in Luke 1,
[4729.84 --> 4730.30]  verse 6.
[4730.96 --> 4731.60]  Luke says,
[4731.76 --> 4732.74]  both of them are righteous
[4732.74 --> 4733.72]  in the sight of God.
[4734.84 --> 4735.28]  How?
[4736.02 --> 4737.54]  Observing all the Lord's commands
[4737.54 --> 4738.44]  and decrees
[4738.44 --> 4740.06]  blamelessly.
[4740.06 --> 4742.20]  So,
[4742.26 --> 4743.08]  not only do you have
[4743.08 --> 4743.82]  a pure heart,
[4743.94 --> 4745.20]  but you are also righteous.
[4747.60 --> 4748.80]  Are you getting nervous yet?
[4750.58 --> 4751.98]  This is not works righteousness.
[4752.12 --> 4752.94]  I'm not talking about that.
[4753.04 --> 4753.16]  Right?
[4753.92 --> 4755.30]  There's no condemnation in Christ
[4755.30 --> 4756.36]  because he was a sin offering,
[4756.62 --> 4757.22]  but now,
[4757.34 --> 4757.94]  now we're talking about
[4757.94 --> 4758.64]  the Christian life.
[4759.92 --> 4760.48]  True or false,
[4760.60 --> 4762.04]  Christians are good people.
[4762.04 --> 4766.86]  What does Paul say
[4766.86 --> 4768.16]  is the fruit of the Spirit
[4768.16 --> 4770.26]  in Galatians chapter 5?
[4772.82 --> 4773.72]  But the fruit of the Spirit
[4773.72 --> 4774.82]  is love,
[4775.52 --> 4775.82]  joy,
[4776.26 --> 4776.64]  peace,
[4777.38 --> 4778.00]  forbearance,
[4778.42 --> 4778.78]  kindness,
[4779.30 --> 4779.74]  goodness,
[4780.68 --> 4781.16]  faithfulness,
[4781.28 --> 4781.62]  gentleness,
[4781.68 --> 4782.26]  and self-control.
[4782.38 --> 4783.00]  Against such things,
[4783.06 --> 4783.72]  there is no law.
[4786.70 --> 4787.22]  So,
[4787.34 --> 4788.14]  here's an experience
[4788.14 --> 4789.08]  I had recently
[4789.08 --> 4790.54]  that I think illustrates this
[4790.54 --> 4791.02]  pretty well.
[4791.54 --> 4791.74]  So,
[4792.54 --> 4794.08]  as I mentioned last week,
[4794.22 --> 4794.34]  we,
[4794.70 --> 4795.32]  our family,
[4795.54 --> 4797.06]  we took a trip this summer.
[4797.28 --> 4797.96]  We saw our families
[4797.96 --> 4798.66]  on the East Coast.
[4798.86 --> 4799.60]  We came back.
[4799.66 --> 4800.90]  When we returned from our trip,
[4801.22 --> 4802.08]  we had like a week
[4802.08 --> 4803.02]  before school started
[4803.02 --> 4804.32]  and we had a whole list
[4804.32 --> 4804.84]  of chores
[4804.84 --> 4806.06]  and things we wanted
[4806.06 --> 4806.74]  to get done
[4806.74 --> 4807.40]  before school.
[4808.16 --> 4808.82]  One of them
[4808.82 --> 4809.78]  was to clean the car,
[4810.36 --> 4810.84]  the cars.
[4811.54 --> 4811.82]  So,
[4812.18 --> 4812.94]  I got to work.
[4813.20 --> 4814.14]  I got out the vacuum.
[4814.30 --> 4815.36]  I got the extension cord.
[4815.44 --> 4816.08]  I brought it out
[4816.08 --> 4816.70]  into the driveway.
[4817.28 --> 4818.26]  I pulled out
[4818.26 --> 4819.04]  all the mats
[4819.04 --> 4820.18]  and shuck out all the dirt
[4820.18 --> 4821.92]  and gathered the trash
[4821.92 --> 4823.70]  and I vacuumed the car
[4823.70 --> 4824.10]  and I got,
[4824.26 --> 4825.92]  I got the dirt out
[4825.92 --> 4827.12]  and my son Abram,
[4827.24 --> 4828.62]  he wiped down the interior
[4828.62 --> 4830.72]  and when we were done,
[4830.80 --> 4831.24]  you know what?
[4831.78 --> 4833.10]  The car looked great,
[4833.62 --> 4833.86]  right?
[4834.12 --> 4835.04]  It's clean
[4835.04 --> 4836.50]  and you get in it
[4836.50 --> 4838.20]  and it's just a wonderful feeling
[4838.20 --> 4839.40]  to have a clean car.
[4839.62 --> 4840.16]  It almost makes you
[4840.16 --> 4841.24]  just want to go for a ride,
[4841.34 --> 4842.04]  put down the windows
[4842.04 --> 4842.38]  and be like,
[4842.42 --> 4843.12]  I have a clean car.
[4843.12 --> 4844.96]  Now,
[4845.04 --> 4845.68]  here's the point.
[4846.50 --> 4848.62]  If you were to actually go
[4848.62 --> 4849.52]  and look in this car
[4849.52 --> 4851.08]  and look around,
[4851.76 --> 4853.72]  you would find some scratches here,
[4853.86 --> 4855.30]  you would find some dirt there,
[4855.68 --> 4857.30]  there's some stains on the seat
[4857.30 --> 4859.32]  and you would have no problem
[4859.32 --> 4860.84]  finding that this car
[4860.84 --> 4861.98]  is not exactly perfect
[4861.98 --> 4863.88]  and yet,
[4864.14 --> 4865.60]  we would still say,
[4865.68 --> 4866.86]  it's a clean car,
[4867.40 --> 4867.58]  right?
[4867.62 --> 4868.58]  It's not brand new,
[4868.86 --> 4869.80]  it's not spotless,
[4869.80 --> 4870.62]  it's not perfect,
[4870.84 --> 4872.26]  but we'd still call it
[4872.26 --> 4873.20]  a clean car
[4873.20 --> 4875.42]  and in the same way,
[4876.52 --> 4876.80]  no,
[4876.94 --> 4877.84]  you are not perfect,
[4878.34 --> 4879.46]  you are not spotless
[4879.46 --> 4880.14]  and sinless
[4880.14 --> 4881.42]  and yet,
[4881.52 --> 4881.80]  God,
[4881.92 --> 4883.04]  because of his grace,
[4883.40 --> 4884.70]  he looks upon
[4884.70 --> 4886.16]  your sincere efforts
[4886.16 --> 4887.06]  in the Christian life
[4887.06 --> 4888.00]  and he says,
[4888.18 --> 4888.92]  that is good
[4888.92 --> 4890.82]  and he says,
[4891.04 --> 4892.88]  that's clean,
[4893.24 --> 4894.10]  I approve,
[4895.52 --> 4895.72]  right?
[4895.78 --> 4897.00]  The righteous requirements
[4897.00 --> 4897.52]  of the law
[4897.52 --> 4899.02]  is fulfilled in us,
[4899.02 --> 4900.54]  not because we are perfect
[4900.54 --> 4901.28]  and sinless,
[4901.72 --> 4902.82]  that we obey the law
[4902.82 --> 4903.52]  of God perfectly,
[4903.86 --> 4905.30]  but because in Christ
[4905.30 --> 4906.50]  and in the power
[4906.50 --> 4907.14]  of the Spirit,
[4907.32 --> 4908.54]  we live in a way
[4908.54 --> 4910.22]  that God is pleased
[4910.22 --> 4911.12]  to us say,
[4911.44 --> 4912.38]  I accept this,
[4913.64 --> 4913.90]  right?
[4913.98 --> 4914.78]  And it's just like,
[4914.80 --> 4915.06]  you know,
[4915.20 --> 4917.96]  a kid who draws,
[4918.16 --> 4918.94]  colors a painting
[4918.94 --> 4920.56]  and brings it to,
[4921.14 --> 4921.54]  you know,
[4922.22 --> 4923.02]  the father
[4923.02 --> 4923.46]  and says,
[4923.54 --> 4924.50]  look what I've done
[4924.50 --> 4925.28]  and you're saying,
[4925.40 --> 4925.76]  hey kid,
[4925.82 --> 4925.96]  look,
[4926.02 --> 4926.84]  this isn't Picasso,
[4927.28 --> 4927.56]  you know,
[4927.62 --> 4928.52]  this isn't Van Gogh,
[4929.02 --> 4929.54]  no,
[4929.62 --> 4930.04]  it's not,
[4930.24 --> 4931.92]  but what does the parent say?
[4933.84 --> 4934.28]  Approved,
[4934.94 --> 4935.16]  right?
[4935.20 --> 4936.02]  This is wonderful,
[4936.38 --> 4936.92]  you did it,
[4936.94 --> 4937.66]  this is so good
[4937.66 --> 4940.24]  and God does that same thing
[4940.24 --> 4940.66]  with us
[4940.66 --> 4941.78]  when we,
[4942.02 --> 4942.90]  with the help of the Spirit,
[4943.08 --> 4944.92]  we seek to obey him,
[4945.16 --> 4945.86]  the Holy Spirit
[4945.86 --> 4946.56]  at work in us
[4946.56 --> 4947.28]  and God says,
[4947.60 --> 4948.04]  fulfilled.
[4948.76 --> 4950.00]  The righteous requirements
[4950.00 --> 4950.60]  of the law
[4950.60 --> 4951.48]  are fulfilled
[4951.48 --> 4952.88]  in us.
[4953.68 --> 4953.92]  You know,
[4954.00 --> 4954.86]  it's like pedaling,
[4954.96 --> 4955.86]  you're pedaling your bike,
[4955.86 --> 4958.00]  God is running alongside,
[4958.26 --> 4959.44]  he's holding on,
[4959.52 --> 4960.74]  he's helping you balance
[4960.74 --> 4962.22]  and he's saying to you,
[4962.70 --> 4963.02]  look,
[4963.26 --> 4964.38]  you are doing it.
[4965.26 --> 4965.72]  Look,
[4965.82 --> 4966.54]  you're doing it.
[4967.86 --> 4968.32]  Right?
[4968.40 --> 4969.56]  And that is the nature
[4969.56 --> 4970.72]  of our Heavenly Father
[4970.72 --> 4972.14]  towards his children
[4972.14 --> 4974.60]  because he is loving
[4974.60 --> 4976.28]  and he is gracious to us.
[4976.74 --> 4977.10]  So,
[4977.20 --> 4977.72]  you know what friends,
[4977.80 --> 4978.66]  that you,
[4979.24 --> 4979.78]  this morning,
[4979.84 --> 4980.26]  right now,
[4980.30 --> 4981.54]  you can open your heart
[4981.54 --> 4982.86]  today
[4982.86 --> 4984.06]  and you can ask God,
[4984.48 --> 4984.82]  Lord,
[4984.90 --> 4986.22]  would you send your Holy Spirit
[4986.22 --> 4986.96]  into my life?
[4987.40 --> 4988.52]  Would you send your Holy Spirit
[4988.52 --> 4989.74]  into my reality
[4989.74 --> 4990.44]  and would you
[4990.44 --> 4991.68]  be with me
[4991.68 --> 4992.92]  and would you walk with me
[4992.92 --> 4994.12]  and would you help me
[4994.12 --> 4995.14]  moment by moment,
[4995.32 --> 4996.12]  step by step
[4996.12 --> 4998.30]  so that you would always
[4998.30 --> 4998.88]  be with me?
[5000.22 --> 5001.06]  So let's,
[5001.10 --> 5001.78]  let's ask God
[5001.78 --> 5002.94]  to help us
[5002.94 --> 5003.90]  as we,
[5004.00 --> 5005.22]  as we pray that prayer.
[5009.90 --> 5010.34]  Lord,
[5010.42 --> 5010.96]  we thank you
[5010.96 --> 5012.14]  for your amazing grace
[5012.14 --> 5012.68]  to us.
[5012.86 --> 5013.94]  That not only
[5013.94 --> 5015.02]  do you forgive us
[5015.02 --> 5015.62]  in Christ,
[5016.40 --> 5016.74]  but Lord,
[5016.80 --> 5017.62]  you give us the life
[5017.62 --> 5018.62]  of the Spirit
[5018.62 --> 5021.36]  and you approve
[5021.36 --> 5021.84]  of that work
[5021.84 --> 5022.54]  because it's the work
[5022.54 --> 5023.30]  of the Holy Spirit
[5023.30 --> 5023.94]  and you will not
[5023.94 --> 5024.94]  deny yourself.
[5028.18 --> 5028.90]  So Lord,
[5028.98 --> 5029.70]  would you give us
[5029.70 --> 5030.26]  that help
[5030.26 --> 5030.86]  that is
[5030.86 --> 5032.68]  from outside
[5032.68 --> 5033.36]  of ourselves
[5033.36 --> 5034.38]  so that we would be able
[5034.38 --> 5035.48]  to live a life
[5035.48 --> 5036.88]  that is approved
[5036.88 --> 5037.44]  by you.
[5038.28 --> 5038.82]  Thank you,
[5038.90 --> 5038.96]  Lord,
[5038.98 --> 5039.96]  for being a good father
[5039.96 --> 5041.80]  who plants our feet
[5041.80 --> 5042.46]  solidly
[5042.46 --> 5043.00]  on the rock
[5043.00 --> 5043.56]  of Christ
[5043.56 --> 5044.78]  and who runs
[5044.78 --> 5045.46]  with us
[5045.46 --> 5046.62]  helping us
[5046.62 --> 5047.16]  to live
[5047.16 --> 5048.16]  the life
[5048.16 --> 5048.52]  that you have
[5048.52 --> 5049.26]  called us to live.
[5049.44 --> 5049.56]  Lord,
[5049.60 --> 5050.20]  we thank you
[5050.20 --> 5050.78]  and we pray
[5050.78 --> 5051.56]  in Jesus' name
[5051.56 --> 5052.56]  and for his sake.
[5053.06 --> 5053.36]  Amen.
[5055.86 --> 5056.32]  All right,
[5056.36 --> 5056.82]  let's stand
[5056.82 --> 5057.30]  and let's sing
[5057.30 --> 5058.12]  a song of response.
[5058.12 --> 5058.60]  Let's sing
[5058.60 --> 5059.12]  a song of response.
[5059.12 --> 5085.76]  Take my life and let it be
[5085.76 --> 5091.88]  Consecrated Lord to Thee
[5091.88 --> 5097.64]  Take my all and set my place
[5097.64 --> 5103.38]  Let that flow in endless grace
[5103.38 --> 5110.20]  Let that flow in endless grace
[5110.20 --> 5116.58]  Take my hand and let them move
[5116.58 --> 5122.50]  At the impulse of Thy love
[5122.50 --> 5127.68]  Take my beautiful body
[5127.68 --> 5133.68]  Swift and beautiful for Thee
[5133.68 --> 5140.68]  Swift and beautiful for Thee
[5140.68 --> 5147.68]  Take my voice and let me sing
[5147.68 --> 5154.06]  Always only for my King
[5154.06 --> 5159.68]  Take my lips and let them be
[5159.68 --> 5166.06]  Fill with messages from Thee
[5166.06 --> 5172.68]  Fill with messages from Thee
[5172.68 --> 5179.06]  Take my will and let me divide
[5179.06 --> 5185.06]  It shall be no longer mine
[5185.06 --> 5191.06]  Take my heart, it is the Lord
[5191.06 --> 5197.44]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[5197.44 --> 5203.06]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[5203.06 --> 5211.44]  Take my heart, it is the Lord
[5211.44 --> 5217.44]  Take my heart, my Lord
[5217.44 --> 5231.82]  Take my heart, my Lord
[5231.82 --> 5235.82]  I'll call it my dream
[5235.82 --> 5238.20]  This treasure's joy
[5238.20 --> 5244.20]  Take my soul and I will be
[5244.20 --> 5250.20]  Never only all for Thee
[5250.20 --> 5258.20]  Never only all for Thee
[5258.20 --> 5261.32]  May be seated
[5261.32 --> 5269.28]  So we worship the Lord also
[5269.28 --> 5272.58]  By giving our prize and offerings
[5272.58 --> 5275.20]  Our designated offering today is for Delta Christian School
[5275.20 --> 5280.08]  And those young ladies there this morning
[5280.08 --> 5282.70]  Stacey, I don't know about Jasmine
[5282.70 --> 5283.86]  I don't think so
[5283.86 --> 5286.00]  But two of them go to Delta Christian School
[5286.00 --> 5290.80]  And so it continues to have a great impact on the children of our community
[5290.80 --> 5291.94]  Our own families
[5291.94 --> 5297.00]  And so let us give as the Lord leads us to give this morning
[5297.00 --> 5300.44]  And may I ask our deacons to come forward to collect the offering
[5300.44 --> 5305.56]  Come on
[5305.56 --> 5307.32]  Thank you
[5307.32 --> 5308.42]  memoir
[5308.42 --> 5310.56]  Say
[5310.56 --> 5340.54]  Thank you.
[5340.56 --> 5370.54]  Thank you.
[5370.56 --> 5400.54]  Thank you.
[5400.56 --> 5430.54]  Thank you.
[5430.56 --> 5460.54]  Thank you.
[5460.56 --> 5490.54]  Thank you.
[5490.56 --> 5520.54]  Thank you.
[5520.54 --> 5528.62]  Lord, your word encourages us to be still and know that you are God.
[5528.62 --> 5550.84]  And Father, whether we are trying to outrun your presence in our lives with busyness, or we're fighting against you maybe by ignoring something that you're trying to tell us, Lord, whatever it is, would you quiet our hearts and would you satisfy each one of us this morning with your faithful love?
[5550.84 --> 5580.82]  Your love for us in Christ, Lord, thank you for your love.
[5580.84 --> 5588.04]  They're 90 years old, Lord, you're 90 years old, Lord, you are writing your story on each of our lives.
[5588.10 --> 5592.90]  It's amazing the way you work in each one of us differently.
[5592.90 --> 5605.12]  But you call your children, Lord, you're doing our lives, Lord, and you grow us, Lord, to maturity and faith.
[5605.12 --> 5614.34]  We also pray for our children, we thank you for their children, we thank you for their children.
[5614.34 --> 5624.48]  That you have brought in their history to their children to their children to bring to the school.
[5624.48 --> 5633.34]  And Lord, we thank you for their new addition that you've blessed them with, that they may continue to grow and serve the children there.
[5633.34 --> 5643.80]  And Lord, we ask that your light would shine into the hearts of each child at Delta Christian School as they also come to know you.
[5643.98 --> 5651.48]  We pray, Lord, for your blessing upon their teachers, their EAs, their administrators, to Brian, the president.
[5651.48 --> 5655.26]  Lord, we ask that you continue to provide for their needs.
[5656.08 --> 5662.14]  And Lord, give them a fruitful and vital ministry year this coming year for your glory.
[5662.14 --> 5670.76]  We pray, Lord, that for our own congregation, we pray that you'd be with Henny as she now moves into her new home at Augustine House.
[5671.32 --> 5674.98]  We pray for Wilma also, who is recently moved there.
[5676.14 --> 5680.04]  And Lord, we thank you that you are with us wherever we go.
[5681.06 --> 5685.10]  That you are always before us, behind us, and surrounding us.
[5685.86 --> 5692.04]  Father, we pray for those who are experiencing pain or illness of various kinds.
[5692.94 --> 5698.82]  Lord, you know of the many people in our congregation who long for healing.
[5700.06 --> 5702.64]  And so, Lord, we lift each of them up to you.
[5703.54 --> 5713.16]  Lord, we pray for wisdom for doctors and medical professionals to know the causes and to give the right treatments.
[5713.16 --> 5722.66]  Father, when we go through stressful times, whether it's with our health, whether it's with our work, our relationships,
[5723.08 --> 5729.66]  Lord, your word reminds us that you're not just with us, but Lord, you are at work on our behalf.
[5729.66 --> 5737.70]  Father, we don't know what that always looks like, but we ask that it would be clear how you are working in our lives.
[5737.70 --> 5742.74]  And Lord, as you call us to know and follow you, you make us a light to the nations,
[5742.74 --> 5747.82]  so that in and through us all people might know that you are the one true and living God.
[5748.20 --> 5751.52]  And so we pray, O Lord, for our witness as a church.
[5751.52 --> 5764.64]  We pray that we, as your people here at Latter CRC, might live out and demonstrate your love and your faithfulness.
[5764.64 --> 5773.38]  Help us, Lord, to be a light and to invite others that you've put into our lives to come and to know you.
[5774.40 --> 5775.74]  And Lord, would your kingdom come?
[5776.68 --> 5781.18]  And we wait for the day when you will return, bringing in the fullness of your kingdom,
[5781.54 --> 5783.88]  ending darkness and death and sin once for all.
[5784.56 --> 5786.50]  And so, Lord, help us to pray, come, Lord Jesus.
[5787.26 --> 5793.06]  And to know in the meantime that you, the God of heaven's armies, are with us and that you are for us.
[5793.06 --> 5795.42]  And we pray in Jesus' name for his sake.
[5796.12 --> 5796.44]  Amen.
[5798.60 --> 5799.80]  All right, let's all stand.
[5800.36 --> 5802.90]  And we leave here with God's blessing upon us.
[5803.12 --> 5804.94]  As a reminder, stay, please.
[5805.18 --> 5809.66]  You're invited to stay to join us for lunch, to join us for cake and coffee,
[5809.96 --> 5811.66]  in a time of fellowship after the service.
[5812.20 --> 5815.74]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[5816.70 --> 5818.02]  This comes from Deuteronomy.
[5818.82 --> 5820.44]  Be strong and courageous.
[5820.44 --> 5823.26]  Do not be terrified or afraid.
[5823.94 --> 5825.80]  For the Lord your God goes with you.
[5826.38 --> 5829.08]  He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[5829.70 --> 5830.10]  Amen.
[5830.10 --> 5830.18]  Amen.
[5830.18 --> 5830.20]  Amen.
[5830.20 --> 5830.22]  Amen.
[5830.22 --> 5830.26]  Amen.
[5830.26 --> 5832.26]  Amen.
[5832.26 --> 5834.10]  Amen.
[5834.10 --> 5836.26]  Amen.
[5836.26 --> 5838.26]  Amen.
[5838.26 --> 5840.26]  Amen.
[5840.26 --> 5842.26]  Amen.
[5842.26 --> 5844.26]  Amen.
[5844.26 --> 5846.26]  Amen.
[5846.26 --> 5848.26]  Amen.
[5848.26 --> 5849.26]  Amen.
[5849.26 --> 5849.38]  Amen.
[5873.52 --> 5874.92]  Amen.
[5874.92 --> 5879.14]  Amen.
[5879.14 --> 5881.06]  to me
[5881.06 --> 5885.34]  by your grace
[5885.34 --> 5887.26]  to the same
[5887.26 --> 5888.92]  or get the
[5888.92 --> 5890.84]  large
[5890.84 --> 5892.58]  of our faith
[5892.58 --> 5894.42]  my love
[5894.42 --> 5895.92]  for your glory
[5895.92 --> 5897.90]  love
[5897.90 --> 5899.72]  that as peace
[5899.72 --> 5901.14]  and unity
[5901.14 --> 5904.26]  in us now we pray
[5904.26 --> 5907.04]  and in heaven
[5907.04 --> 5908.86]  for your souls are free
[5908.86 --> 5910.42]  by the storm
[5910.42 --> 5911.66]  that heals us
[5911.66 --> 5914.66]  for he does not
[5914.66 --> 5915.70]  today
[5937.04 --> 5944.06]  for your soul
[5944.06 --> 5944.90]  to the earth
[5944.90 --> 5953.60]  and in heaven
[5953.60 --> 5983.58]  Thank you.
