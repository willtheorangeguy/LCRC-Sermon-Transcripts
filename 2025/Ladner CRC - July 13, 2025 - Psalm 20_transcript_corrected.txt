[356.28 → 359.08] Good morning, everyone.
[359.08 → 362.42] Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[362.42 → 364.08] My name is Jason True.
[364.08 → 366.78] I have the privilege of serving as the lead pastor here.
[366.78 → 370.42] And it is my joy to welcome us to worship this morning.
[370.42 → 378.00] And we believe that God is at work in this place this very morning.
[378.00 → 385.40] And not just in this place, but actually in every church here in Delta and in Canada.
[385.40 → 392.16] And indeed throughout the world, wherever Jesus' name is proclaimed.
[392.16 → 398.76] And God is at work gathering his people to grow them in maturity in Christ.
[398.76 → 405.40] And then to send them out to serve the Lord by loving God and loving their neighbours.
[405.40 → 409.88] And so the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is here this morning.
[409.88 → 413.40] And we are all here by his appointment.
[413.40 → 415.40] And we are thankful for that.
[415.40 → 420.72] And so if you are new with us today, and maybe you are visiting with us because of our summer
[420.72 → 423.26] camp, we especially welcome you this morning.
[423.26 → 427.16] And we're glad that you're here, and we hope that you will feel welcomed.
[427.16 → 433.94] And so if you look at your bulletin, you'll find various announcements there.
[433.94 → 436.26] And I just want to highlight a few things.
[436.26 → 443.54] The first is that we have some snacks from our summer camp that were not opened and that
[443.54 → 444.54] were not used.
[444.54 → 446.42] And so we're going to be serving those today.
[446.42 → 450.76] So it's an extra special coffee hour today.
[450.76 → 456.94] We'll have some chips and other goodies available.
[456.94 → 460.44] Also this afternoon, we will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[460.44 → 462.44] All are welcome to join.
[462.44 → 467.16] I think we're there for about half an hour, 45, an hour or so.
[467.16 → 468.88] No more than an hour.
[468.88 → 470.44] And that's at 2.30.
[470.44 → 471.44] Everyone's welcome to meet there.
[471.44 → 475.62] We sing to the residents of Mountain View.
[475.62 → 481.44] Another thing is, sadly, you'll see a bereavement notice in our bulletin.
[481.44 → 488.92] Emily Beecham passed away Wednesday morning at Elam Village with her family by her side.
[488.92 → 492.98] She was a resident there for a few years, but she was a sister in Christ and a member
[492.98 → 495.88] of this church for a very long time.
[495.88 → 501.64] And it was always special for our family because her name is Ellie and my oldest daughter is Ellie.
[501.64 → 505.32] And they would have a little bond over that.
[505.32 → 511.56] The memorial service is scheduled for this coming Friday at 2.30 here in the church.
[511.70 → 516.94] So this Saturday, July 18 at 2.30 will be the memorial service.
[519.36 → 522.64] So now let's enter into our time of worship.
[522.64 → 531.14] God Almighty, the creator of all things, the heavens and the earth, the land and the seas, calls us to worship today.
[531.14 → 538.30] And so I invite you to hear and then to respond to the call to worship this morning from Psalm 27.
[538.58 → 541.62] I'll begin and there'll be a place for you to respond as well.
[543.54 → 548.10] The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?
[549.28 → 554.98] The Lord is the stronghold of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?
[554.98 → 563.54] One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
[564.24 → 569.52] To gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.
[570.64 → 573.34] My heart says of you, seek his face.
[574.32 → 577.38] Your face, Lord, I will seek.
[577.94 → 583.96] Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration as we come before our great God to worship him.
[583.96 → 584.48] Let's pray.
[584.98 → 585.54] Let's pray.
[586.44 → 587.60] And kids, remember how we pray.
[587.70 → 590.50] We bow our head, we close our eyes, we fold our hands.
[591.94 → 597.88] Father, you are worthy to receive glory and honour and power.
[598.28 → 606.86] And what a gift it is to be invited this morning out of the world and into the heavenly places to worship you.
[607.46 → 614.20] And we are gathered this morning here locally as a church, but with our brothers and sisters around the world,
[614.20 → 619.90] with those who have gone before us who are in your presence to worship you.
[619.90 → 623.92] And would your spirit, Lord, be mightily at work in this place.
[623.92 → 626.02] Would you fill our hearts with the joy of heaven?
[626.42 → 639.62] Would you make us sure and secure in that hope that we might go later from this place to love in the way of Jesus and to carry our cross and to live, Lord, for your glory.
[639.62 → 642.96] And it's in his name, the name of Jesus, our Lord, that we pray.
[643.40 → 643.80] Amen.
[644.64 → 649.18] Brothers and sisters, let's stand in body or in spirit as you are able.
[649.50 → 651.76] And God greets us this morning with these words.
[651.76 → 655.78] The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[655.92 → 658.00] My heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
[658.50 → 659.76] My heart leaps for joy.
[660.26 → 662.68] And with my song, I praise him.
[663.58 → 666.34] And so as God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[666.34 → 666.48] Amen.
[666.48 → 666.54] Amen.
[681.76 → 682.76] Amen.
[711.76 → 712.66] Amen.

[716.08 → 716.42] Amen.
[716.58 → 716.90] Amen.
[716.90 → 717.26] Amen.
[720.76 → 725.34] Amen.
[736.34 → 737.34] Amen.
[737.34 → 737.52] Amen.
[737.52 → 738.32] Amen.
[738.32 → 740.52] Amen.
[740.52 → 741.30] Amen.
[741.30 → 741.70] Amen.
[741.70 → 741.74] Amen.
[741.74 → 747.48] To that number, every grain of sand.
[747.94 → 752.74] Give your nation, tremble, white, and joy.
[753.28 → 758.60] All creation, Christ, and to rejoice.
[759.86 → 766.20] The old heart's on, seated on his throne.
[766.20 → 770.04] Come, let us adore him.
[770.04 → 774.22] Behold our feet.
[774.72 → 776.88] Nothing can come back.
[777.46 → 782.76] Come, let us adore him.
[782.76 → 789.60] Come, let us adore him.
[789.60 → 796.44] Let us adore him.
[796.44 → 799.70] Say, don't MonaHтовair.
[799.70 → 801.78] There are had WE Her.
[801.78 → 805.00] Use these poor ideals.
[805.00 → 806.70] The old heart's on, Gesundheit.
[806.70 → 810.68] He's a whole Supreme.
[810.68 → 813.18] Our team melts away
[813.18 → 818.18] We hold our child
[818.18 → 820.80] Seek and hold us strong
[820.80 → 824.42] Come with us after our faith
[824.42 → 828.96] We hold our care
[828.96 → 831.56] Nothing can tell me
[831.56 → 836.46] Come with us after our faith
[840.68 → 851.16] Who has felt the dance upon his hand
[851.16 → 856.42] Bearing all the guilty sinful man
[856.42 → 861.72] God eternal, humble to the grave
[861.72 → 868.04] Jesus, Saviour, risen now to reign
[868.04 → 872.36] We hold our God
[872.36 → 874.96] Seek and hold us strong
[874.96 → 878.52] Come with us adore him
[878.52 → 882.82] We hold our King
[882.82 → 885.22] Nothing can compare
[885.22 → 890.52] Come with us adore him
[890.52 → 899.44] Come with us adore him
[899.44 → 903.84] We hold our King
[903.84 → 905.84] Nothing can compare
[905.84 → 911.52] Come let us adore him
[911.52 → 926.54] While the children are going up and getting ready to sing for us, we're going to sing a song that we sang at camp this week.
[927.08 → 928.82] And it's called, He's Got the Whole World.
[928.82 → 933.64] But we changed a few verses, kind of to go with our story of Jonah, which was our theme.
[934.48 → 941.58] And we recognize that God brought the storm, so He holds the wind and the rain in His hands.
[941.68 → 944.82] And He also brought the big fish, so the fish of the sea.
[945.08 → 946.80] So let's sing, He's Got the Whole World.
[946.80 → 961.06] He's got the whole world in His hands
[961.06 → 965.12] He's got the whole world in His hands
[965.12 → 976.76] He's got the whole world in His hands
[976.76 → 980.10] He's got the wind and the rain
[980.10 → 985.88] In His hands
[985.88 → 989.66] He's got the whole world in His hands
[989.66 → 1006.54] It's got the fish in the sea, in his hands. It's got the fish in the sea, in his hands. It's got the whole world in his hands.
[1006.54 → 1023.54] It's got the here, in his hands. It's got the whole world in his hands.
[1023.54 → 1041.54] It's got the whole world in his hands. It's got the whole world in his hands.
[1053.54 → 1070.54] It's got the whole world in his hands.
[1070.54 → 1100.52] Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise you the Lord.
[1100.52 → 1110.52] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, praise you the Lord.
[1110.52 → 1114.52] Hallelujah, praise you the Lord.
[1114.52 → 1120.52] Praise you the Lord. Hallelujah, praise you the Lord.
[1120.52 → 1130.52] Praise you the Lord. Hallelujah, praise you the Lord.
[1130.52 → 1132.52] Thank you.
[1132.52 → 1134.52] Thank you.
[1134.52 → 1136.52] Thank you.
[1136.52 → 1151.08] I won't turn left, and I won't turn right.
[1151.08 → 1154.98] I will not stare till the path falls right.
[1155.24 → 1158.52] And I'll keep on seeking.
[1159.22 → 1162.36] And I'll keep on reaching.
[1162.36 → 1170.46] And follow, follow, follow Jesus Christ.
[1172.28 → 1176.16] I won't turn left, and I won't turn right.
[1176.54 → 1180.06] I will not stare till the path falls right.
[1180.26 → 1183.56] And I'll keep on seeking.
[1184.14 → 1187.40] And I'll keep on reaching.
[1187.40 → 1195.44] And follow, follow, follow Jesus Christ.
[1195.44 → 1225.42] And I'm public.
[1225.42 → 1230.64] I won't delay, and I won't survive
[1230.64 → 1234.42] I will not see from the past that's right
[1234.42 → 1237.82] And I'll keep on seeking
[1237.82 → 1241.66] And I'll keep on reaching
[1241.66 → 1249.78] And follow, follow, follow Jesus' path
[1249.78 → 1258.04] I'm just one eyes on you
[1258.04 → 1261.62] I'm just one eyes on you
[1261.62 → 1265.16] Only you
[1265.16 → 1270.96] I won't delay, and I won't delay
[1270.96 → 1274.74] I will not stray from the past that's right
[1274.74 → 1278.22] And I'll keep on seeking
[1278.22 → 1282.04] And I'll keep on reaching
[1282.04 → 1290.22] Follow, follow, follow Jesus Christ
[1290.22 → 1298.12] Follow, follow, follow Jesus Christ
[1298.12 → 1314.06] I forgot to introduce that song.
[1314.32 → 1316.44] We learned that one because of Jonah.
[1316.62 → 1318.76] Jonah went left, and he went right,
[1318.88 → 1320.70] and he went everywhere but where he was supposed to go.
[1320.92 → 1322.46] He didn't follow the straight path.
[1322.94 → 1326.14] So here comes a song about fixing our eyes on you,
[1326.14 → 1329.38] And if Jonah had done that in the first place,
[1329.74 → 1332.24] just like us, he wouldn't have got into a lot of trouble.
[1332.84 → 1335.52] So we learned a few things from that song.
[1335.74 → 1337.66] And now they're going to sing a song called
[1337.66 → 1338.70] A Land Called Love.
[1338.70 → 1338.74] A Land Called Love
[1338.74 → 1350.34] A Lady Called Love
[1350.34 → 1352.50] A Land Called Love
[1352.50 → 1374.68] Love is real and love is true.
[1374.68 → 1387.68] There's a land called Love for you.
[1387.68 → 1395.68] There's a land where your dreams come true.
[1395.68 → 1401.68] So far away we can get so close to you.
[1401.68 → 1415.68] Can you imagine what things you could do in a land called Love?
[1415.68 → 1421.68] Trust all your cares in a cloud.
[1421.68 → 1428.68] You can sing, you can laugh, or just smile.
[1428.68 → 1435.68] When you get tired, you can rest for a while.
[1435.68 → 1441.68] Keep down and fall apart.
[1441.68 → 1450.68] If God's a land of any land, it's very near.
[1450.68 → 1460.68] And it can still, something you've never felt before.
[1460.68 → 1467.68] Love is real and love is true.
[1467.68 → 1480.68] Love is real and love is true.
[1480.68 → 1495.68] There's a land called Love for you.
[1495.68 → 1507.68] Love is real and love is true.
[1507.68 → 1522.68] There's a land called Love for you.
[1522.68 → 1523.68] Don't agree with you.
[1524.68 → 1525.68] USC.
[1525.68 → 1528.68] Hopeful.
[1529.68 → 1534.68] Losing the Lord ?
[1534.68 → 1539.68] Silence.
[1540.68 → 1541.38] I love you.
[1541.68 → 1544.68] folkIRSTATUS
[1544.68 → 1551.68] Hitler
[1552.68 → 1557.44] All right.
[1557.58 → 1558.24] Thank you, kids.
[1558.28 → 1558.76] That was wonderful.
[1559.20 → 1564.96] We had about 30 or so kids during the camp, and here's our brave choir who's able to come
[1564.96 → 1565.34] today.
[1565.62 → 1566.24] So thank you.
[1566.94 → 1574.30] Now, we come to a time of confession and renewal, and sometimes here where I live in Richmond,
[1574.30 → 1580.80] walking along the dike, you'll see signs that warn of invasive plants, invasive species.
[1580.80 → 1583.04] I don't know.
[1583.10 → 1586.06] Maybe some of you know what some of them are, but I think knot weed, right?
[1586.10 → 1586.62] Is that one?
[1587.50 → 1589.62] I didn't ask our local plant experts yet.
[1589.90 → 1591.40] There are Himalayan blackberries.
[1592.36 → 1595.08] Also, I'm getting nods from Bart, so that's good.
[1596.24 → 1601.16] So now, the thing is, they may look leafy and green and harmless, but the plants actually
[1601.16 → 1603.96] choke out the other plant life around it.
[1604.76 → 1610.06] And I think you could actually dub invasive species as sin plants.
[1610.80 → 1612.02] Sin plants.
[1612.18 → 1618.54] Because when they're left unchecked, they keep spreading, and they choke out healthy growth.
[1619.54 → 1625.90] But with the Holy Spirit's help, we can be watchful and vigilant to notice and to weed
[1625.90 → 1630.28] out the sin plants in our own hearts and lives.
[1630.28 → 1636.46] And then bring them before our Saviour, who always meets us with abundant mercy.
[1637.40 → 1640.08] And so let's do that now in this time of confession.
[1640.54 → 1642.62] And this will be based on Psalm 40.
[1642.84 → 1644.16] Would you please join me in prayer?
[1645.24 → 1646.12] Let's pray together.
[1646.12 → 1650.64] Do not withhold your mercy from me, O Lord.
[1651.64 → 1654.38] May your love and faithfulness always protect me.
[1655.34 → 1657.56] For troubles without number surround me.
[1658.30 → 1661.84] My sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.
[1662.68 → 1667.50] They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.
[1667.50 → 1670.26] Be pleased to save me, Lord.
[1670.68 → 1672.62] Come quickly, Lord, to help me.
[1673.36 → 1676.68] May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
[1677.34 → 1680.22] May those who long for your saving help always say,
[1680.68 → 1681.88] The Lord is great.
[1682.88 → 1686.74] As for me, I am poor and needy.
[1687.52 → 1689.00] May the Lord think of me.
[1689.66 → 1691.58] You are my help and my deliverer.
[1692.14 → 1693.34] You are my God.
[1693.94 → 1694.84] Do not delay.
[1694.84 → 1697.78] May the Lord think of me.
[1697.78 → 1705.02] So I invite you to take a moment to bring that need for God to weed out the sin in our hearts,
[1705.12 → 1712.06] the invasive species of sin that prevents true growth and trust in the Lord,
[1712.68 → 1718.64] and to ask for his forgiveness, and to identify those things that need to be rooted out.
[1724.84 → 1742.16] O Lord, you are the gardener.
[1742.16 → 1746.24] Lord, you planted a beautiful world all around us.
[1747.50 → 1751.92] And, Lord, you want to plant within us through your Holy Spirit the fruit of the Spirit.
[1752.92 → 1757.74] But, Lord, we acknowledge, Lord, the invasive species of sin that dwell within us.
[1757.74 → 1763.08] And, Lord, we ask that by your Spirit, by your help, Lord, you would help us to weed these out.
[1764.12 → 1773.10] That the love, the faithfulness, the trust, the kindness of Christ might grow in us.
[1773.68 → 1775.78] That we might be your faithful followers.
[1776.72 → 1783.28] Lord, we thank you for Christ and his sacrifice on the cross that earns our forgiveness.
[1783.66 → 1784.86] We pray in Jesus' name.
[1784.86 → 1785.42] Amen.
[1786.20 → 1790.28] So, brothers and sisters, the good news of the gospel is that in Christ there is forgiveness.
[1791.02 → 1795.60] So hear these words of pardon and assurance from Psalm 33.
[1797.32 → 1798.34] It says this,
[1798.38 → 1800.96] No king is saved by the size of his army.
[1801.64 → 1804.52] No warrior escapes by his great strength.
[1805.34 → 1807.80] A horse is a vain hope for deliverance.
[1808.24 → 1810.68] Despite all of its great strength, it cannot save.
[1810.68 → 1819.88] But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love.
[1820.54 → 1825.00] In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.
[1825.74 → 1826.58] Thanks be to God.
[1827.44 → 1832.78] And so our next song is going to be another song for the kids and for all of us.
[1833.24 → 1835.90] And it is Jesus Loves Me.
[1836.08 → 1837.42] So let's all stand and let's sing.
[1837.42 → 1857.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1857.24 → 1887.22] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1887.24 → 1917.22] Jesus Loves Me.
[1917.24 → 1919.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1919.24 → 1921.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1921.24 → 1923.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1923.24 → 1924.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1924.24 → 1929.24] Jesus Loves Me.
[1929.24 → 1930.80] This I know.
[1930.80 → 1935.06] As we loved so long ago.
[1935.06 → 1939.60] Taking children on his feet.
[1939.60 → 1943.98] Sing like a crown to me.
[1943.98 → 1945.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1945.98 → 1947.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1947.98 → 1951.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1951.98 → 1953.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1953.98 → 1955.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1955.98 → 1959.98] The Bible tells me so.
[1959.98 → 1970.14] It means that the Lord has a great love so we do so that we're not yet to drink our wine.
[1970.14 → 1971.98] Yes.
[1971.98 → 1973.98] Yes.
[1973.98 → 1975.98] Yes, Jesus Loves Me.
[1975.98 → 1977.98] Next time we're Nor это Things.
[1977.98 → 1989.26] dismissed to go to their Sunday School classes. And so a little bit different
[1989.26 → 1993.60] today we're going to send the kids off before the Lord's Supper which is what
[1993.60 → 1996.66] we're about to celebrate.
[2007.98 → 2018.72] All right so brothers and sisters we come now to the table of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2019.32 → 2027.24] Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And he did this by offering up his life
[2027.24 → 2034.96] as a once and for all perfect sacrifice so that by his blood we have been forgiven, and we have been
[2034.96 → 2042.58] adopted into God's family, and we have been made sons and daughters of the King. And because of these
[2042.58 → 2049.32] things of what Christ has done and how we are to receive them by faith that means this meal is for
[2049.32 → 2057.86] those who call on the name of the Lord. And so we begin our communion service by confessing our faith
[2057.86 → 2063.28] what we believe together, and we're going to do that today with the words of the Nicene Creed because
[2063.28 → 2072.32] some of you may know the Nicene Creed this year is having its 1,700th birthday.
[2073.12 → 2080.58] So in the year 325 the Council of Nicaea met, and it ironed out a lot about what we believe about whom
[2080.58 → 2088.32] Christ is. His he's fully God and fully man and about the Trinity. And so it's because this is this
[2088.32 → 2094.16] anniversary year. We should say the Nicene Creed together, and maybe we'll do that over the coming
[2094.16 → 2102.60] months in this year. So let's say this together. Christian what do you believe?
[2103.32 → 2112.72] We believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and
[2112.72 → 2123.26] invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages,
[2123.98 → 2134.72] God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same essence as the Father.
[2134.72 → 2143.30] Through him all things were made for us and for our salvation. He came down from heaven.
[2144.34 → 2150.88] He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made human.
[2151.90 → 2161.06] He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried. The third day he rose again
[2161.06 → 2168.34] according to the scriptures. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[2169.14 → 2176.42] He will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead. His kingdom will never end.
[2177.18 → 2185.80] And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life. He proceeds from the Father and the Son
[2185.80 → 2193.24] and with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified. He spoke through the prophets.
[2194.16 → 2202.82] We believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic Church. We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
[2203.62 → 2210.88] We look forward to the resurrection of the dead and to life in the world to come. Amen.
[2210.88 → 2210.98] Amen.
[2210.98 → 2222.54] So, brothers and sisters, if what we confess just now, if this is your faith, then this meal is for you,
[2223.04 → 2225.82] whether you are a member of this local congregation.
[2226.50 → 2232.00] And if you are here, though, this morning, and you have not yet put your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2232.00 → 2241.44] for forgiveness, for reconciliation with God, you are indeed our most welcome guest, and we are so glad that you're here.
[2241.84 → 2248.84] But we'd ask you not to take of this meal because it is only properly received by faith in the Son of God
[2248.84 → 2250.84] who died for us.
[2252.32 → 2258.58] We invite you, though, to reflect on the promises of God that are freely available to you.
[2258.58 → 2264.94] And so, hear now these words of the institution of the Lord's Supper.
[2265.70 → 2268.64] The Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread,
[2269.28 → 2272.10] and when he had given thanks, he broke it.
[2272.84 → 2274.98] He said, this is my body, which is for you.
[2275.60 → 2277.36] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2278.22 → 2284.16] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[2284.72 → 2287.92] Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[2288.62 → 2294.78] For whenever you eat this bread, and you drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[2295.64 → 2296.96] So would you join me in prayer?
[2297.26 → 2297.90] Let's pray together.
[2300.30 → 2304.62] Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you in praise, in adoration.
[2305.48 → 2310.94] We lift our hearts to you in wonder and in awe and in Thanksgiving.
[2310.94 → 2313.98] For the good news of Jesus Christ.
[2314.60 → 2319.62] And for his work that he accomplished on the cross on our behalf.
[2320.66 → 2324.64] And Father, we ask now that your Holy Spirit would set apart this bread and this cup.
[2324.64 → 2328.32] So that in receiving them by faith and through the power of the Spirit,
[2328.86 → 2333.18] Our hearts would be united to Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2333.90 → 2335.78] To whom we look in faith.
[2336.58 → 2337.72] And for whom we wait.
[2338.68 → 2340.98] And Lord, so we do pray that you would come soon.
[2341.62 → 2342.94] To set all things right.
[2344.06 → 2345.54] Bless us, me, O Lord, we ask.
[2345.90 → 2347.58] In Christ's name and for his sake.
[2347.90 → 2348.20] Amen.
[2350.04 → 2354.28] May I ask our elders to come forward.
[2356.14 → 2357.74] And deacons, I believe.
[2358.48 → 2362.30] And help us serve the elements.
[2365.04 → 2365.86] Just elders.
[2366.28 → 2367.28] Just elders.
[2367.28 → 2368.28] Just elders.
[2368.28 → 2369.28] Just elders.
[2369.28 → 2370.28] Just elders.
[2370.28 → 2371.28] Just elders.
[2371.28 → 2372.28] Just elders.
[2372.28 → 2374.28] Just elders.
[2374.28 → 2376.28] Just elders.
[2376.28 → 2377.64] Just elders.
[2377.74 → 2379.30] Just elders.
[2379.42 → 2380.14] So let's hear them now.
[2381.98 → 2382.18] Amen.
[2386.20 → 2389.00] Thank you.
[2393.00 → 2393.04] Amen.
[2402.98 → 2404.02] Thank you.

[2495.92 → 2496.92] Amen.
[2525.92 → 2526.92] Amen.
[2545.98 → 2549.14] Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ broken for you.
[2555.92 → 2556.92] Amen.
[2585.92 → 2590.92] Amen.
[2591.92 → 2593.92] Amen.
[2593.92 → 2594.92] Amen.
[2594.92 → 2596.92] Amen.
[2624.92 → 2626.92] Amen.
[2654.92 → 2656.92] Amen.
[2684.92 → 2686.92] Amen.
[2714.92 → 2716.92] Amen.
[2744.92 → 2746.92] Amen.
[2774.92 → 2776.92] Amen.
[2776.92 → 2777.92] Amen.
[2777.92 → 2778.92] Amen.
[2778.92 → 2779.92] Amen.
[2779.92 → 2780.92] Amen.
[2780.92 → 2781.92] Amen.
[2781.92 → 2782.92] Amen.
[2782.92 → 2783.92] Amen.
[2783.92 → 2784.92] Amen.

[2785.92 → 2786.92] Amen.
[2786.92 → 2787.92] Amen.
[2787.92 → 2788.92] Amen.
[2788.92 → 2789.92] Amen.
[2789.92 → 2790.92] Amen.
[2790.92 → 2791.92] Amen.
[2791.92 → 2792.92] Amen.
[2792.92 → 2793.92] Amen.
[2793.92 → 2794.92] Amen.
[2794.92 → 2798.92] Brothers and sisters, this is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ shed for the remission of all of your sins.
[2798.92 → 2800.92] Let's drink together.
[2800.92 → 2801.92] Amen.
[2801.92 → 2802.92] Amen.
[2802.92 → 2803.92] Amen.
[2803.92 → 2804.92] Amen.
[2804.92 → 2805.92] Amen.
[2805.92 → 2806.92] Amen.
[2810.92 → 2812.92] Would you pray with me?
[2812.92 → 2823.92] Gracious God, Heavenly Father, we thank you for the amazing gift that your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, begotten, not made.
[2823.92 → 2829.92] Through whom all things were made, Lord you came into this world on a rescue mission,
[2829.92 → 2835.34] To rescue all of us living in a world of darkness because of our own sin.
[2835.46 → 2837.54] Cut off from the source of life.
[2838.20 → 2839.94] And you came, and you gave your life.
[2840.52 → 2843.34] That in you, we might have life and life eternal.
[2844.34 → 2848.64] Lord we thank you that though we do not deserve it.
[2848.64 → 2852.80] Your grace and your love was abounding for us.
[2853.68 → 2857.06] And that even now as we receive this meal.
[2857.06 → 2861.72] One Sunday every month Lord not only are we remembered.
[2862.42 → 2867.00] Do we remember your sacrifice but Lord we are nourished by your grace.
[2867.58 → 2873.06] Because of your spirit that is still active and present and at work in each of our hearts.
[2873.82 → 2876.02] Lord thank you for this meal.
[2876.68 → 2883.48] Which is also a foretaste of the great heavenly banquet that we will enjoy in your presence when you come again.
[2884.38 → 2885.14] We pray Lord.
[2885.14 → 2887.14] Lord we thank you, Lord.
[2887.46 → 2889.04] In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[2889.56 → 2889.82] Amen.
[2892.30 → 2896.16] Brothers and sisters go to their worship service.
[2896.16 → 2901.20] Father, of the Son, and this of God is the evangelist.
[2908.94 → 2910.38] Judith.
[2910.38 → 2940.36] All right, so we have been in, as you know if you've been here for a while,
[2940.36 → 2946.50] you know that we've been in a sermon series since the fall, kind of looking passage by passage on and off,
[2947.02 → 2951.02] in the book of Romans, and last week we finished Romans chapter 7.
[2951.38 → 2958.76] Now, this is a good place to pause because chapter 8 is such an amazing and rich chapter in the Bible
[2958.76 → 2965.00] that we're going to save Romans chapter 8 for when I get back from some time away at the end of the summer.
[2965.56 → 2973.48] So for today, I thought let's pick a psalm to look at today, and the psalm I chose is Psalm 20.
[2974.28 → 2978.66] So I encourage you to open your Bibles to Psalm 20.
[2981.22 → 2986.00] And I chose a psalm and then later realized there's not a lot of people who have preached on this psalm,
[2986.00 → 2987.64] so that's no help.
[2988.60 → 2991.20] But I think there are some things we can learn.
[2995.64 → 2999.02] So this is on page 408 in your pew Bible.
[3000.00 → 3001.64] 408, we'll also have it on the screen.
[3003.44 → 3004.08] Psalm 20.
[3004.84 → 3007.22] Let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[3007.22 → 3012.12] May the Lord answer you when you are in distress.
[3013.18 → 3015.80] May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
[3016.64 → 3020.70] May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.
[3021.32 → 3025.24] May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.
[3026.06 → 3029.86] May he give you the desire of your heart and make all of your plans succeed.
[3029.86 → 3035.86] We will shout for joy when you are victorious and lift our banners in the name of our God.
[3035.86 → 3038.60] May the Lord grant all your requests.
[3039.30 → 3041.82] Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed.
[3042.52 → 3047.20] He answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.
[3048.14 → 3053.94] Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[3054.50 → 3058.84] They are brought to their knees and fall, but we will rise up and stand firm.
[3059.46 → 3060.80] O Lord, save the King.
[3061.62 → 3063.72] Answer us when we call.
[3063.72 → 3065.86] This is the word of the Lord.
[3066.52 → 3067.46] Thank you, God.
[3068.38 → 3073.56] So let's pray, asking God for his blessing upon the reading and preaching of his word.
[3073.70 → 3074.06] Let's pray.
[3074.82 → 3081.16] Our Father in heaven, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[3081.16 → 3088.14] We ask that you would help us in these few minutes that we have to focus on the message of your word.
[3088.90 → 3096.98] Lord, would you help us to understand it, to believe it, to rejoice in it, and Lord, to apply it to our lives.
[3097.64 → 3103.20] And we ask you, Lord, to help us because there is no one else who can aid us in this.
[3104.24 → 3106.76] Would you hear this prayer, and would you bless us through your word?
[3106.76 → 3109.12] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3110.96 → 3125.10] So I titled this sermon, A Prayer for Victory, because this psalm was a congregational prayer for the king and his armies before they went off into battle.
[3125.10 → 3127.42] So imagine this.
[3128.50 → 3133.88] King David, the author of this psalm, is dressed in his battle armour.
[3135.02 → 3139.82] His top generals are flanking him to his right and to his left.
[3140.46 → 3150.70] And then behind them stand the soldiers of the armies of Israel in military formation, along with row upon row of chariots and horses.
[3150.70 → 3159.36] And you'll see above the troops, you see billowing in the wind the banners of the armies of Israel.
[3160.66 → 3170.40] And in the book of the Song of Songs, or the Song of Solomon, chapter 6, verse 4, it refers to this majestic image of these banners, where it says this,
[3170.40 → 3179.12] You are as beautiful as Torah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.
[3179.74 → 3188.26] So that gives you a sense of this picture, the majesty, the beauty of this army with their banners fluttering in the wind.
[3188.26 → 3197.82] But not only do you see the troops with their banners, but all around you, you hear the sounds of men and beasts preparing for war.
[3198.36 → 3202.40] Right? You hear belts with swords being buckled.
[3203.14 → 3205.18] Maybe horses, harnesses jingling.
[3205.70 → 3206.70] Hooves are stamping.
[3207.02 → 3208.08] Armour is clanking.
[3208.08 → 3217.08] But before the army marches off, out of the city, off to battle, something has to happen first.
[3218.08 → 3219.48] The priests come out.
[3220.20 → 3228.18] And all the citizens of Jerusalem gather around the king and around the army, and they sing this song.
[3228.18 → 3237.50] They sing the words of Psalm 20 over the king and his army, asking God for victory in the upcoming battle.
[3238.08 → 3242.36] In this song, it begins with words of benediction.
[3243.42 → 3248.24] Right? You may have noticed, repeated this word may, in verses 1 through 5.
[3248.90 → 3252.06] May the Lord answer you and protect you.
[3253.00 → 3254.88] May he send you help.
[3255.76 → 3257.72] May he remember your sacrifices.
[3258.56 → 3260.26] May he make your plans succeed.
[3260.60 → 3263.52] May we shout for joy at your victory.
[3264.68 → 3267.66] It's a prayer of blessing and benediction.
[3268.08 → 3274.72] And it's a song declaring that God will be their protector and their help and their support.
[3275.50 → 3275.60] Right?
[3275.64 → 3278.24] That God will give the victory that they desire.
[3278.56 → 3282.22] That he will cause their strategies to succeed.
[3283.30 → 3287.50] And that through the battle, God himself will be the one to save them.
[3287.50 → 3294.82] And so, we have the priests of Israel and all the citizens and the king himself and the soldiers.
[3295.48 → 3300.14] And they are all declaring together in song and in prayer.
[3300.94 → 3306.60] That even though it is the king and his armies who are about to mount those horses and mount those chariots.
[3307.06 → 3311.32] That their trust is ultimately in the Lord God.
[3311.32 → 3317.12] And this image is a striking one for many reasons.
[3317.20 → 3321.62] But one reason is because it is filled with tension.
[3322.38 → 3322.90] Okay?
[3322.94 → 3324.44] It's an image filled with tension.
[3325.12 → 3329.80] And we see that tension in the final verse of the psalm in verse 9.
[3330.74 → 3332.14] The psalm ends with this.
[3332.14 → 3334.58] Lord, give victory to the king.
[3335.28 → 3337.94] Answer us when we call.
[3339.78 → 3348.34] So, in spite of the confidence expressed in this psalm, it is clear that victory is still in the future.
[3349.04 → 3352.88] And indeed, victory is not a foregone conclusion.
[3352.88 → 3361.30] And so, the tension of the psalm is between fear that things are going to go horribly wrong in this battle.
[3362.00 → 3366.16] And the hope that with God's help, they are going to be victorious.
[3367.38 → 3373.38] And in the centre of that tension between fear and hope lies trust.
[3374.86 → 3375.06] Okay?
[3375.16 → 3379.88] The centre of the tension between fear and hope lies trust.
[3379.88 → 3384.92] And while we here today, we're not going to leave here and go off to battle.
[3385.34 → 3386.14] I hope not.
[3387.16 → 3388.50] We will leave here.
[3388.90 → 3391.72] And we are going to go and reenter our lives.
[3392.58 → 3394.58] And we're going to live in that tension.
[3395.32 → 3395.50] Right?
[3395.54 → 3397.72] The tension between fear and hope.
[3398.32 → 3404.08] And that means that we will have the opportunity in each of our lives, whatever we face,
[3404.50 → 3406.40] we're going to have the opportunity to trust God.
[3406.40 → 3412.32] Hey, trusting God is one of the central themes of the Christian life.
[3413.20 → 3414.68] But it's not an easy one.
[3415.14 → 3423.82] It's something that we have to learn and grow in throughout our whole Christian lives about what it means to trust God.
[3425.08 → 3426.84] And I think Psalm 20 helps us.
[3426.84 → 3435.98] It helps us by teaching us about trusting God with our own desires and our own plans for our lives, our families, our church, our world.
[3437.56 → 3448.58] And so as we consider this theme of trusting God from the Psalm, what I want to do is use a food metaphor that I think illustrates our experience of growing in our trust in God.
[3448.84 → 3448.98] Okay?
[3449.00 → 3449.68] A food metaphor.
[3450.32 → 3453.46] I hope this will be helpful and that you'll bear with me.
[3454.38 → 3455.46] So here's the food metaphor.
[3455.46 → 3460.84] I grew up in a family where one of our favourite foods to eat in the summer is lobster.
[3461.86 → 3464.68] Now, as you may know, lobster used to be kind of a poor man's food.
[3464.84 → 3466.84] No one would really eat those things.
[3468.34 → 3471.98] Later, it became now you can barely even afford to buy one.
[3473.16 → 3475.12] But when I was growing up, it was kind of in the middle.
[3475.28 → 3476.40] It was maybe like a steak.
[3476.54 → 3477.82] It was something that you could eat.
[3477.82 → 3480.20] And so I have vivid memories of this.
[3480.20 → 3488.08] Eating lobster at restaurants right by the dock of the water where there are boats parked there, pile high with lobster traps.
[3488.74 → 3491.36] Or even just at home on the deck in the summer.
[3492.34 → 3495.18] And for a kid, eating a lobster is a bit tricky.
[3495.36 → 3496.90] It's not just like eating a hot dog, right?
[3496.94 → 3498.56] We just kind of gobble it down.
[3498.56 → 3501.46] There's a method that you have to learn.
[3502.64 → 3507.18] And so learning to trust in God is perhaps a little bit like learning to eat a lobster.
[3508.56 → 3509.96] So let's unpack this metaphor.
[3510.40 → 3510.90] Here we go.
[3512.06 → 3516.48] After you boil the lobster in a big pot, it turns bright red.
[3517.30 → 3518.78] And you are ready to begin.
[3519.72 → 3521.94] So you begin with the claws.
[3522.94 → 3525.24] And what you're supposed to do is use a special tool.
[3525.32 → 3527.26] It's kind of like a nutcracker to crack open the claw.
[3527.76 → 3531.12] And then you use maybe a little special fork or just your fork.
[3531.50 → 3535.70] And you kind of pull out, dig out the meat from inside the claw.
[3536.88 → 3539.24] And, you know, you get a couple good bites.
[3539.92 → 3541.48] But it's kind of like an appetizer.
[3541.48 → 3544.34] You just get a taste of what's to come.
[3544.44 → 3546.10] And it leaves you hungry for more.
[3546.10 → 3551.62] And I think this is where a lot of us start in the Christian life.
[3551.66 → 3554.16] This is where we begin to learn to trust in God.
[3554.26 → 3556.56] It's kind of, it's a basic kind of trust.
[3557.34 → 3559.78] And it begins with the belief that God exists.
[3560.60 → 3561.64] And that he is good.
[3562.46 → 3564.68] And that he desires good things for you.
[3565.76 → 3567.54] And you learn that you can pray to him.
[3567.58 → 3569.02] And that he will hear you.
[3569.88 → 3571.98] And you believe that God will answer your prayers.
[3572.78 → 3575.44] And this is where most of us begin in faith.
[3576.66 → 3580.20] You know whether we're a child or whether we come to faith later in life even.
[3581.76 → 3584.92] And when we read Psalm 20, we, you know, we read this kind of prayers.
[3584.98 → 3586.46] And they're encouraging to us.
[3586.94 → 3590.20] These are, there are prayers that God will answer us when we are in trouble.
[3590.88 → 3592.24] That he will protect us.
[3592.42 → 3593.34] He will help us.
[3593.38 → 3594.16] He will support us.
[3594.20 → 3595.32] He will favour us.
[3595.32 → 3597.68] He will give us our heart's desire.
[3598.10 → 3600.20] Fulfill our plans and requests.
[3600.54 → 3601.90] That he will save us.
[3602.42 → 3605.14] And where others fall, we will rise and stand.
[3606.02 → 3606.88] And that sounds good.
[3606.88 → 3612.32] And when we're first starting out in faith, we think, yes, I will trust in God.
[3613.04 → 3616.16] Because we want our desires and our plans to succeed.
[3616.16 → 3619.62] But what do we mean when we say desires?
[3620.68 → 3625.74] Well, at this stage of the Christian life, we simply mean the things I want.
[3625.86 → 3627.20] Our, my desires, right?
[3627.20 → 3629.44] I want my job to be fulfilling.
[3630.02 → 3633.06] I want a partner who is attractive and who appreciates me.
[3633.62 → 3635.14] I want friends that care about me.
[3635.22 → 3637.86] I want enough money to pursue my dreams.
[3639.10 → 3641.20] And what do we mean by our plans?
[3641.42 → 3646.26] Well, we simply mean the way I foresee things playing out in my life.
[3646.80 → 3647.02] Right?
[3647.06 → 3651.92] I have a general roadmap of how I think I'm going to get the things that I desire.
[3651.92 → 3655.16] And so this is the first stage of trust.
[3655.24 → 3660.66] When we say that we trust in God, what we mean is that we hope that he will do for us
[3660.66 → 3663.88] what we want in the way that we want him to do it.
[3665.22 → 3670.10] And that we can ask God for this because he is real, and he answers our prayers.
[3671.86 → 3677.20] Now, before we move on from this, I want to stop and think about what is right about this.
[3677.76 → 3680.16] Because there are a few things that are right about this.
[3680.70 → 3681.10] Right?
[3681.10 → 3685.40] When we trust in God in this way, well, we are first believing that he is good.
[3686.26 → 3687.16] And that is right.
[3687.24 → 3687.92] He is good.
[3688.98 → 3690.92] We are believing that we need him.
[3690.96 → 3691.68] And that is right.
[3691.78 → 3692.68] We do need him.
[3693.74 → 3696.26] But there's something wrong with this view as well.
[3696.26 → 3702.32] Because in this view of God, in this kind of trusting in God, it makes God something of like a personal butler.
[3703.52 → 3703.88] Right?
[3703.94 → 3710.94] Where it's God's job to anticipate our desires and provide everything we need when we want it in the way that we want it.
[3711.10 → 3713.36] So here's a test.
[3713.44 → 3718.24] How do we know if we are kind of at this stage of trusting in God?
[3718.24 → 3723.68] Well, the test is to think about the kind of prayers that you pray.
[3724.98 → 3730.30] If the majority of your prayers tend to be centred on asking God to do things for you,
[3730.74 → 3735.72] then perhaps you're at this first stage of learning to trust in God.
[3735.72 → 3738.24] And if that's you, don't worry.
[3738.24 → 3739.98] Because that's where we all begin.
[3740.68 → 3746.76] But the important thing is not just to stay at that kind of more shallow level of trust,
[3746.84 → 3749.86] but actually to grow deeper in your trust in God.
[3750.68 → 3750.98] Right?
[3751.06 → 3756.40] Like the lobster claw, there's a little bit to eat there, but it's not enough to satisfy you.
[3756.40 → 3759.82] And it's going to leave you hungry for more.
[3761.30 → 3764.16] And so let's keep going, and we're going to go back to the metaphor.
[3765.14 → 3767.20] So we've pulled off the claws of the lobster.
[3767.82 → 3770.42] We've, you know, eaten the meat inside of those.
[3770.48 → 3774.04] And we're going to put those in a pile on the side of the plate.
[3774.04 → 3777.36] So what do we have next in front of us?
[3778.60 → 3780.76] The body of the lobster.
[3781.32 → 3783.96] Now, if you crack open the body, it's the biggest part.
[3784.04 → 3787.16] You may think, okay, here's where it's going to happen, right?
[3787.76 → 3789.66] But when you crack it open, what do you find?
[3790.86 → 3794.10] There's nothing edible to eat in the body of the lobster.
[3794.38 → 3798.64] There are some gills, there are some organs, but they're bitter to the taste.
[3798.64 → 3807.80] And so the body of the lobster represents those places in life where we experience the pain and the disappointment of life.
[3808.38 → 3808.82] Right?
[3808.94 → 3811.84] We lose maybe a close friend or a family member.
[3812.08 → 3820.54] We're fired from our jobs, or we're not satisfied with our jobs, or our marriage doesn't turn out the way we hoped, or we get sick, or any number of things.
[3821.88 → 3828.46] You know, we've been trusting God with what we want, and then the answer comes back, and the answer is no.
[3828.64 → 3829.14] Right?
[3830.34 → 3836.80] We had our plans for how our life would work out, but God does not make those plans succeed.
[3837.98 → 3844.34] And so disappointment with God begins to creep in, and that disappointment leads to distrust.
[3845.28 → 3850.82] We might not say it out loud, but we're no longer sure if God loves us.
[3851.64 → 3853.78] It becomes harder and harder to pray.
[3853.94 → 3857.08] You know, maybe God feels absent, and we don't sense his presence.
[3857.08 → 3863.78] Or we wonder if he's just indifferent, like he doesn't care about our pain and our disappointments.
[3865.78 → 3873.82] And to go back to the metaphor, right, if this is your first time eating lobster, and you don't have someone who is guiding you with what to do next,
[3873.82 → 3879.84] you probably would do what any normal person would do, which is to throw it away and think,
[3880.08 → 3883.26] I do not understand the kind of people who eat this.
[3883.26 → 3894.28] And the temptation, in the same way, is just to stop trusting God entirely, to give up and say, well, this isn't worth it, or it's not working.
[3896.46 → 3897.94] Now, what's right about this?
[3899.04 → 3901.86] Well, what's right about it is that you are no longer naive.
[3902.56 → 3902.82] Right?
[3902.88 → 3905.92] You've lived long enough to take some of those gut punches of life.
[3905.92 → 3912.72] And you've rightly realized that God may very well let catastrophe happen to you.
[3913.34 → 3922.50] The world is not a safe place, and God's protection in his love is not what you thought it means.
[3923.16 → 3924.46] What you initially thought.
[3924.96 → 3925.16] Right?
[3925.82 → 3929.32] Now, it's still there, but not what you were expecting.
[3929.32 → 3936.62] And your desires are still there, but you begin to realize that God does not give every Christian everything they want.
[3938.58 → 3941.54] So, what is, so that's what's right.
[3942.30 → 3943.82] Now, what's wrong with this picture?
[3944.94 → 3952.12] Well, what's wrong is that trusting God, whether it's in Psalm 20, or in other passages of the Bible, or really in all life,
[3959.32 → 3960.74] All right, everyone, he's back here.
[3966.10 → 3966.90] Here's the truth.
[3967.18 → 3970.56] Trusting in God is trusting in a person.
[3971.70 → 3977.78] Not just trusting what he can give you, if he can make your plan succeed or give you the desires of your heart.
[3977.78 → 3979.12] It's trusting in a person.
[3981.34 → 3985.76] And trust, you see, is in God himself.
[3985.76 → 3994.46] Trusting in who he is, in his character, in his plans for us and for the world, in his integrity, in his goodness.
[3995.00 → 3995.98] It's trusting God.
[3997.00 → 4007.06] And the mistake here is that we, we're, when we're in this middle stage, the mistake we make is that we're still actually praying and hoping for what we want in the way we want it.
[4008.22 → 4008.42] Right?
[4008.50 → 4013.50] God is still the cosmic butler who is to bless our plans and our desires.
[4013.50 → 4016.82] And the only difference now is our life experiences.
[4017.52 → 4017.64] Right?
[4017.70 → 4020.94] And so in the first stage, you haven't yet been disappointed.
[4021.76 → 4024.26] And here in the second stage, you have been.
[4025.80 → 4029.08] But still, it's centred around your prayers.
[4029.28 → 4032.54] Your trust is centred around what you want and your desires.
[4033.54 → 4039.10] And so here's the test to determine if you are kind of at this stage in your trust in God.
[4039.10 → 4046.68] If the majority of your prayers are why prayers, God, why did you let this happen?
[4048.12 → 4050.54] Maybe this is where you're living.
[4051.30 → 4052.60] In your trust in God.
[4052.76 → 4056.28] You believe in him, that he exists, that he is good.
[4056.68 → 4060.42] But you have these desires, they didn't, God didn't bless those desires.
[4060.78 → 4062.20] And so your prayers are God, why?
[4062.54 → 4064.14] And that's natural and that's fine.
[4064.14 → 4070.16] But what I want to say to comfort you in this is that that won't last forever.
[4070.98 → 4072.76] And that there is more to come.
[4074.04 → 4074.92] So take courage.
[4075.88 → 4078.88] And because there's this other stage of learning to trust in God.
[4078.98 → 4085.46] Because you see, after you pull off the body of the lobster, and you set that aside, what do you have next?
[4085.46 → 4088.78] The tail.
[4089.56 → 4090.88] The tail of the lobster.
[4091.62 → 4092.76] Has anybody eaten a lobster?
[4093.94 → 4094.88] Not many of you.
[4094.92 → 4095.08] Okay.
[4095.42 → 4097.04] So I'm glad we're having this conversation.
[4097.46 → 4098.34] You can learn something here.
[4098.68 → 4105.42] There's apparently a YouTube channel called something like, you're eating it wrong.
[4106.12 → 4109.04] So you can go on and look at all these different foods and learn how to eat it properly.
[4109.04 → 4116.20] So after you eat the claws, that's the front, and then you get to the body and there's nothing there.
[4116.38 → 4117.56] It's bitter and disappointing.
[4117.70 → 4118.28] You throw that away.
[4118.56 → 4121.12] And what you have next is the tail of the lobster.
[4121.68 → 4123.68] Now this is what you've been waiting for.
[4124.58 → 4124.74] Okay.
[4124.78 → 4126.16] This is what you've been expecting.
[4126.34 → 4127.36] This is what you've been anticipating.
[4127.68 → 4132.28] Because you crack open the tail and what you discover is the tail is the best part.
[4132.36 → 4134.06] That's where all the meat is.
[4134.40 → 4138.34] And it is rich, and it is sweet, and it is delicious.
[4138.34 → 4141.28] And then you eat it, and you're like, ah, I see.
[4141.56 → 4144.00] This is why people eat these things.
[4144.98 → 4149.88] And this, in the same way, is the heart of what it means to trust in God.
[4151.18 → 4153.04] Now, let's think about that.
[4153.12 → 4159.22] So verse 7 is probably, you know, the most well-known verse in Psalm 20.
[4160.12 → 4168.20] It says this, some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[4168.34 → 4172.38] And so here, you know, he mentions chariots and horses.
[4172.84 → 4174.54] And what does that refer to?
[4175.10 → 4178.76] It refers to the military might of an ancient army.
[4178.92 → 4182.06] It's like the tanks of an ancient army.
[4182.68 → 4185.76] And, you know, chariots and horses are impressive.
[4186.30 → 4187.18] They are impressive.
[4187.18 → 4191.62] If you stand next to a large horse, you feel pretty small.
[4192.74 → 4193.90] They're powerful.
[4194.78 → 4196.08] They're alive.
[4196.56 → 4197.50] They're intelligent.
[4198.46 → 4200.14] They are bigger and stronger than you are.
[4200.22 → 4200.94] You feel small.
[4201.64 → 4206.30] If you stand before a charging horse, you feel pretty vulnerable.
[4206.30 → 4219.70] If you stand before a team of charging horses, pulling chariots, you're going to wish that you were like Ryan and could run really far and fast.
[4220.00 → 4221.82] Because you want to get out of there.
[4221.82 → 4231.82] And so it's easy to see how ancient kings and armies, how they saw chariots and horses as an object of trust.
[4231.82 → 4242.76] It's very natural for people, even for Christians, to feel much more confident when we have money and power and strength.
[4243.06 → 4247.06] When we have our chariots and our horses, if you will.
[4248.06 → 4248.16] Right?
[4248.24 → 4250.42] But Israel was not to trust in chariots and horses.
[4250.42 → 4253.26] But in the name of the Lord our God.
[4253.98 → 4255.66] Or as verse 1 says,
[4256.38 → 4258.72] May the Lord answer you when you are in distress.
[4258.90 → 4262.50] May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
[4262.56 → 4267.04] That's shorthand for the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
[4267.38 → 4273.00] The God who revealed himself to Moses in a burning bush, who led the people of Israel out of their bondage,
[4273.32 → 4278.38] into a promised land, who gave them the law, who protected them and rooted out the armies of Canaan.
[4278.38 → 4282.82] That God will protect you.
[4286.36 → 4288.14] And the thing is, when we say,
[4288.34 → 4290.90] May the name of the Lord our God protect you.
[4290.94 → 4293.66] It's not like God's name is like a magic charm.
[4294.28 → 4294.72] Right?
[4294.76 → 4295.70] Where you just say it.
[4295.98 → 4296.72] The name of the Lord.
[4296.80 → 4297.50] The name of the Lord.
[4297.72 → 4300.24] And automatically you're like equipped with protection.
[4300.54 → 4301.58] That's not how it works.
[4302.24 → 4304.16] God is never under our control.
[4305.26 → 4308.04] God's name actually just refers to
[4308.04 → 4309.86] His presence.
[4310.24 → 4311.10] His power.
[4311.72 → 4312.52] And His person.
[4313.56 → 4313.66] Right?
[4313.70 → 4315.62] That's what it means when we say God's name.
[4315.80 → 4318.00] It's God's name is God.
[4319.32 → 4320.88] And more particularly,
[4321.68 → 4323.42] God's name is God in action.
[4324.16 → 4325.86] God in action to protect
[4325.86 → 4328.00] and to save His people.
[4328.00 → 4331.26] And so when we say the name of God,
[4331.26 → 4335.76] it is so weighty and powerful and just pulsating with reality
[4335.76 → 4340.98] that you don't need an army if this,
[4341.38 → 4342.00] if you,
[4342.36 → 4344.10] if God is your God.
[4344.42 → 4348.90] You do not need an army if this God is your God.
[4349.04 → 4350.46] Or at least not a very big one.
[4350.46 → 4354.28] And that's why David says to Goliath,
[4354.34 → 4355.64] remember David and Goliath?
[4356.04 → 4357.08] David says to Goliath,
[4357.42 → 4360.12] you come against me with sword and spear and javelin,
[4360.86 → 4362.34] but I come against you
[4362.34 → 4365.10] in the name of the Lord Almighty,
[4365.32 → 4367.06] the God of the armies of Israel.
[4368.78 → 4370.14] In the name of the Lord.
[4370.54 → 4372.84] Not in trusting in military equipment.
[4372.84 → 4375.00] And so when we read Psalm 20
[4375.00 → 4376.38] and we hear that we are to trust
[4376.38 → 4377.82] in the name of the Lord our God,
[4377.94 → 4379.02] as Christians,
[4379.36 → 4380.56] we read Psalm 20
[4380.56 → 4382.46] in the light of Christ.
[4383.40 → 4385.62] And we learn then that the name
[4385.62 → 4388.04] that we are to trust in
[4388.04 → 4390.48] is the name of Jesus Christ.
[4391.72 → 4394.28] Because Jesus is the only one
[4394.28 → 4395.84] who perfectly trusted
[4395.84 → 4397.64] in God His Father.
[4398.86 → 4401.84] And so if we want to see Psalm 20 in action,
[4401.84 → 4404.20] if we want to see Psalm 20 lived out
[4404.20 → 4405.40] to the fullest,
[4406.06 → 4407.76] we look to the life of Jesus.
[4409.28 → 4411.12] And Jesus' trust in God the Father
[4411.12 → 4412.74] was not naive and shallow,
[4413.58 → 4415.60] nor was it bitter and doubting,
[4416.28 → 4417.90] even though Jesus' life
[4417.90 → 4419.86] was filled with pain and disappointment
[4419.86 → 4421.82] and surprise and betrayal.
[4423.74 → 4424.42] And in fact,
[4424.48 → 4427.52] in the moment of greatest fear for Jesus,
[4427.70 → 4429.00] when He was kneeling
[4429.00 → 4430.30] in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[4430.78 → 4431.82] praying to God the Father,
[4431.84 → 4434.16] to provide a different way,
[4435.06 → 4436.86] Lord, use a different plan
[4436.86 → 4439.12] to accomplish your will
[4439.12 → 4441.46] so we wouldn't have to die
[4441.46 → 4442.30] on a Roman cross.
[4442.70 → 4444.44] God the Father said no
[4444.44 → 4446.38] to Jesus.
[4448.32 → 4449.60] And so Jesus knows
[4449.60 → 4450.34] what it feels like
[4450.34 → 4451.64] to have some deep desire
[4451.64 → 4452.70] and some deep plan
[4452.70 → 4454.66] and to have God say no to it.
[4456.24 → 4457.06] But remember,
[4457.20 → 4458.78] how did Jesus end that prayer
[4458.78 → 4460.06] in the Garden of Gethsemane?
[4460.88 → 4462.00] If you know the story,
[4462.10 → 4462.90] you know He ended it
[4462.90 → 4465.16] with the greatest prayer of trust
[4465.16 → 4466.62] that has ever been uttered
[4466.62 → 4467.36] by human lips.
[4468.44 → 4469.84] Because then He prays,
[4470.34 → 4471.44] not my will,
[4472.16 → 4473.04] but Your will.
[4473.56 → 4474.00] Be done.
[4474.94 → 4475.56] Which is to say,
[4475.64 → 4477.14] Lord, not my heart's desire,
[4477.34 → 4478.76] but Your heart's desire.
[4478.76 → 4481.92] And so Jesus trusted the Father
[4481.92 → 4482.96] so deeply
[4482.96 → 4484.98] that God's desire
[4484.98 → 4485.82] and God's plans
[4485.82 → 4488.72] became Jesus' desires
[4488.72 → 4490.60] and His plans.
[4490.96 → 4491.92] And so that truly,
[4492.42 → 4493.72] God did give Him
[4493.72 → 4494.76] His heart's desire
[4494.76 → 4496.64] because His heart's desire
[4496.64 → 4499.20] was united with God's heart's desire.
[4499.20 → 4503.00] And that desire, of course,
[4503.06 → 4504.50] was the salvation of all of us
[4504.50 → 4506.82] who shallowly trust in God
[4506.82 → 4508.84] and who maybe distrust Him sometimes.
[4510.54 → 4511.68] You know, and on the cross,
[4511.80 → 4514.46] Jesus embodied verse 8 of our psalm.
[4515.48 → 4516.90] They are brought to their knees
[4516.90 → 4517.62] and fall,
[4518.22 → 4519.62] but we rise up and stand firm.
[4521.16 → 4522.76] You know, Jesus took our sin,
[4523.00 → 4525.26] He took our distrust of God
[4525.26 → 4526.38] upon Himself,
[4526.38 → 4528.66] and He was crushed under the weight of it
[4528.66 → 4530.02] so that through Him
[4530.02 → 4532.36] we can then begin to trust God again.
[4533.02 → 4534.48] That we can rise up.
[4535.50 → 4536.22] And in Jesus,
[4536.36 → 4537.90] we find that great David,
[4538.88 → 4540.04] the king,
[4540.52 → 4542.18] great David's greater son,
[4542.96 → 4544.50] He won the battle for us.
[4544.56 → 4545.88] He won the victory for us.
[4545.88 → 4547.98] You know, God answered him
[4547.98 → 4549.16] in his distress
[4549.16 → 4550.80] as the Davidic king.
[4551.58 → 4553.00] God gave him help
[4553.00 → 4554.64] from His heavenly sanctuary.
[4554.64 → 4557.14] God remembered and accepted forever
[4557.14 → 4559.08] the sacrifice which Jesus offered.
[4560.14 → 4561.98] Indeed, the sacrifice that He became.
[4563.38 → 4565.92] And God gave him a decisive victory,
[4566.04 → 4567.08] a once-for-all victory
[4567.08 → 4568.22] through the cross
[4568.22 → 4570.92] where this warrior God wages battle
[4570.92 → 4573.70] against sin and evil
[4573.70 → 4575.90] and death and the devil.
[4576.32 → 4577.76] And He does so in meekness
[4577.76 → 4579.80] and in self-giving love.
[4581.16 → 4581.98] And on the cross,
[4582.10 → 4583.88] Christ's enemies were brought down
[4583.88 → 4584.50] and fallen
[4584.50 → 4586.96] and He was raised up
[4586.96 → 4588.20] and He was enthroned
[4588.20 → 4589.58] in heaven
[4589.58 → 4590.52] at the right hand of God.
[4592.12 → 4592.76] And you know,
[4592.86 → 4593.64] thinking about Jesus,
[4593.80 → 4595.40] He could have trusted in swords,
[4595.48 → 4595.84] couldn't He?
[4595.96 → 4597.74] His disciples wanted to use swords.
[4599.44 → 4600.62] Jesus could have called
[4600.62 → 4602.98] an army of angels
[4602.98 → 4605.36] to protect Him,
[4605.74 → 4606.82] to accomplish what
[4606.82 → 4608.16] maybe He wanted,
[4608.16 → 4610.52] to fight for Him.
[4610.80 → 4611.56] But in Jesus,
[4611.70 → 4613.10] we see what
[4613.10 → 4615.60] perfect trust in God the Father
[4615.60 → 4616.24] looks like.
[4617.54 → 4618.34] In Jesus,
[4618.56 → 4618.86] indeed,
[4618.94 → 4619.94] we see the name
[4619.94 → 4621.82] of the God of Jacob
[4621.82 → 4622.86] made flesh.
[4624.54 → 4625.58] And this is why,
[4625.70 → 4625.98] friends,
[4626.10 → 4626.68] in Him,
[4627.12 → 4629.04] in Jesus as our King,
[4629.62 → 4631.16] our salvation is secure.
[4632.08 → 4633.62] His banner over us
[4633.62 → 4634.22] is love.
[4635.12 → 4635.96] And in Christ,
[4636.04 → 4637.16] all the promises of God
[4637.16 → 4638.32] are yes and amen
[4638.32 → 4639.52] for your sake.
[4640.84 → 4642.02] So here's the invitation
[4642.02 → 4642.88] to us this morning.
[4643.68 → 4645.38] Is that by trusting
[4645.38 → 4646.92] in the name of Jesus,
[4646.92 → 4649.28] we would submit
[4649.28 → 4650.30] our plans
[4650.30 → 4651.78] and our desires
[4651.78 → 4654.10] to God,
[4655.14 → 4656.28] trusting that His plans
[4656.28 → 4657.14] and His desires
[4657.14 → 4658.66] for us
[4658.66 → 4659.64] are good.
[4660.92 → 4661.64] And that He
[4661.64 → 4663.66] will actually meet
[4663.66 → 4664.46] all of our needs
[4664.46 → 4666.64] in a way better
[4666.64 → 4667.70] than we can even
[4667.70 → 4668.72] ask or imagine.
[4670.40 → 4671.30] And so let's pray for that.
[4671.56 → 4672.20] Let's pray that God
[4672.20 → 4672.90] would help us
[4672.90 → 4674.26] trust Him
[4674.26 → 4674.90] in that way.
[4677.90 → 4678.72] Heavenly Father,
[4678.84 → 4679.80] we thank You
[4679.80 → 4680.80] for loving us
[4680.80 → 4683.48] and for caring for us
[4683.48 → 4685.14] and for being
[4685.14 → 4686.32] a trustworthy God.
[4687.08 → 4687.76] And Lord,
[4687.82 → 4688.60] we want to grow
[4688.60 → 4689.14] and deepen
[4689.14 → 4690.26] in our trust in You.
[4690.34 → 4691.12] And that means,
[4692.08 → 4692.80] Lord,
[4692.86 → 4693.54] maybe letting go
[4693.54 → 4694.40] of our desires
[4694.40 → 4696.02] and our plans.
[4697.22 → 4697.84] And Lord,
[4697.94 → 4699.24] asking that Your will
[4699.24 → 4699.80] would be done
[4699.80 → 4700.64] and that You would
[4700.64 → 4703.34] conform our hearts
[4703.34 → 4704.68] and our desires
[4704.68 → 4706.56] to what You desire
[4706.56 → 4707.32] for us,
[4707.92 → 4708.90] trusting in You
[4708.90 → 4710.42] that in Christ
[4710.42 → 4713.50] we have all things.
[4713.78 → 4714.46] Maybe not the way
[4714.46 → 4715.36] we would understand it
[4715.36 → 4715.94] in this life,
[4716.00 → 4716.56] but ultimately
[4716.56 → 4718.24] all things will be ours,
[4718.34 → 4719.44] all things will be restored,
[4719.98 → 4720.60] and all things
[4720.60 → 4721.30] will be made new.
[4722.34 → 4722.68] Lord,
[4722.72 → 4723.22] would You help us
[4723.22 → 4724.14] come to this very
[4724.14 → 4725.12] heart of trust
[4725.12 → 4726.84] that we may continue
[4726.84 → 4728.14] to place all of our trust
[4728.14 → 4729.68] ultimately in You.
[4730.36 → 4731.30] In the name of Jesus,
[4731.42 → 4731.74] our King,
[4731.80 → 4732.18] we pray.
[4732.66 → 4732.96] Amen.
[4732.96 → 4736.64] All right,
[4736.70 → 4737.26] let's stand
[4737.26 → 4739.12] and we'll sing
[4739.12 → 4740.14] a song of response.
[4740.14 → 4740.34] Amen.
[4762.96 → 4763.96] né
[4763.96 → 4764.96] NG
[4764.96 → 4765.96] Amen.
[4794.96 → 4795.96] Amen.
[4824.96 → 4825.96] Amen.
[4854.96 → 4855.96] Amen.
[4884.96 → 4913.02] So we have an opportunity each week to respond with freewill offerings to God because of his grace and his goodness to us.
[4913.02 → 4924.80] And as our deacons come and pass the baskets or the bags for those gifts, let us meditate on the generous heart of God for us.
[4925.38 → 4930.18] And then also consider giving to the work of God's church in this world.
[4930.80 → 4937.08] If you are visiting with us today, you are welcome to give, but please feel under no obligation to do so.
[4937.56 → 4939.00] We are simply glad that you're here.
[4939.00 → 4945.30] Our designated offering for this Sunday is Life Water Canada.
[4945.30 → 4951.30] Life Water Canada
[4951.30 → 4954.30] Life Water Canada
[4954.30 → 4959.30] Music
[4959.30 → 4960.80] Let us Two
[4961.30 → 4963.30] Guy
[4963.30 → 4965.30] Amen.
[4993.30 → 4995.30] Amen.
[5023.30 → 5025.30] Amen.
[5053.30 → 5055.30] Amen.
[5055.30 → 5056.30] Amen.
[5056.30 → 5057.30] Amen.
[5057.30 → 5059.30] Amen.
[5059.30 → 5061.30] Amen.
[5061.30 → 5063.30] Amen.
[5063.30 → 5065.30] Amen.
[5065.30 → 5067.30] Amen.
[5067.30 → 5069.30] So I'd like to lead us in a time of prayer now.
[5069.30 → 5078.30] It's a prayer of supplication where we bring the needs of our congregation and the needs of the world before God in prayer.
[5078.30 → 5080.30] So let's go to the Lord in prayer together.
[5080.30 → 5096.30] Our great God and Father, Lord, what a privilege it is to address you as our Father.
[5096.30 → 5104.30] And we do that not on our own merits, but on the merits of your Son, Christ our Lord.
[5104.30 → 5109.30] And in his name we come before you.
[5109.30 → 5113.30] And we rejoice, Lord, that we can approach your throne boldly in that name.
[5113.30 → 5121.30] Father, you call us to pray for this world and the leaders that you have set over it.
[5121.30 → 5130.30] Lord, so as the people of Israel prayed for the King's success, we ask that you would also bless the leaders of our country.
[5130.30 → 5136.30] Lord, grant them wisdom and the knowledge of your truth that comes only from you and your word.
[5136.30 → 5140.30] That they might lead in ways that are just for the good of all people.
[5140.30 → 5144.30] Help us, Lord, not to trust in military power and might.
[5144.30 → 5149.30] Not to continually build up strength.
[5149.30 → 5157.30] Help us not, Lord, to trust in kings or armies, but only in the help that comes from your heavenly sanctuary.
[5157.30 → 5161.30] And in the power, Lord, that comes only from your right hand.
[5161.30 → 5167.30] And Father, we do rejoice that even as we have the privilege of living in such a wonderful country,
[5167.30 → 5173.30] we rejoice that our citizenship is not just here, but it is in heaven.
[5173.30 → 5178.30] And from heaven we await the kingdom of Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[5178.30 → 5182.30] And so, Lord, would that kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven.
[5182.30 → 5190.30] And we ask, Lord, that you would grant to your church great fruitfulness in its ministry here in, Lord, in this congregation
[5190.30 → 5193.30] and in your church around the world.
[5193.30 → 5196.30] We thank you, Lord, for the summer camp that we had last week.
[5196.30 → 5200.30] We thank you for each child who came to be a part of it.
[5200.30 → 5211.30] And, Lord, we ask that they would be blessed as they heard the story of Jonah, of your love and your compassion for all people, including them.
[5211.30 → 5219.30] Lord, would the seeds of that gospel message take root as they ultimately are fulfilled in Christ,
[5219.30 → 5226.30] who, like Jonah, was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, but then rose to life.
[5226.30 → 5230.30] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that we have life in you.
[5230.30 → 5235.30] Lord, we pray that each child would grow in knowing and following you.
[5235.30 → 5247.30] And, Lord, would you bring comfort and peace even to the places where it seems from our eyes to be impossible.
[5247.30 → 5254.30] Lord, we know some, but not all, of the needs represented in this church body this morning.
[5254.30 → 5259.30] And we do pray, Lord, for your blessing upon your people here gathered.
[5259.30 → 5262.30] Would you minister tenderly to all of your people?
[5262.30 → 5266.30] Would you help us to put our trust in you for all that we stand in need of?
[5266.30 → 5269.30] God, would you comfort those who are grieving?
[5269.30 → 5272.30] Would you heal those who are sick?
[5272.30 → 5275.30] Would you give rest to those who are weary?
[5275.30 → 5284.30] Lord, we pray particularly this morning for Art Hoekstra in what, humanly speaking, looks to be maybe his final days in hospice.
[5284.30 → 5292.30] Lord, we pray for your gracious presence with Art that he would know deeply that you are his Lord.
[5292.30 → 5296.30] Lord, we pray for comfort for the family.
[5296.30 → 5308.30] We also pray, Lord, for the family and friends of Ellie Burma who also mourn her death, who is such a wonderful sister in Christ and member of this church.
[5308.30 → 5312.30] Lord, would you be with Ellie's family as they mourn her passing.
[5312.30 → 5319.30] Lord, we pray for her, Lord, that she is in the glory of your presence.
[5319.30 → 5325.30] And Lord, we pray that you would be with Wilma Mental in the midst of the pain she's experiencing.
[5325.30 → 5328.30] Lord, grant her relief and healing.
[5328.30 → 5332.30] And Father, we bring all these prayers to you.
[5332.30 → 5338.30] We do so in the strong name of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[5338.30 → 5339.30] Amen.
[5339.30 → 5343.30] Would you please stand?
[5343.30 → 5349.30] And we're going to go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5349.30 → 5351.30] But I want to do something different today.
[5351.30 → 5354.30] So get yourselves ready.
[5354.30 → 5358.30] I want to use the words of Psalm 20.
[5358.30 → 5364.30] And the people of God were gathered, and they blessed the king.
[5364.30 → 5368.30] Now, as your pastor, I'm not a king at all.
[5368.30 → 5372.30] And so actually I thought that'd be kind of weird for you to bless me.
[5372.30 → 5374.30] So I want you to bless each other.
[5374.30 → 5375.30] That's what we're going to do.
[5375.30 → 5382.30] So we're going to kind of split down the middle to the left and right.
[5382.30 → 5387.30] So I want you to kind of turn towards each other, toward the other side.
[5387.30 → 5389.30] And raise your hands.
[5389.30 → 5393.30] And you can kind of look across ways at the words on the screen.
[5393.30 → 5394.30] Okay?
[5394.30 → 5395.30] And you can bless each other.
[5395.30 → 5396.30] We're going to take turns.
[5396.30 → 5397.30] And you can be responsive.
[5397.30 → 5398.30] Okay, so let's go.
[5398.30 → 5399.30] Ready?
[5399.30 → 5400.30] So left.
[5400.30 → 5401.30] You guys start.
[5401.30 → 5405.30] May the Lord answer you when you are in distress.
[5405.30 → 5408.30] May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
[5408.30 → 5416.30] May he answer your help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.
[5416.30 → 5422.30] May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.
[5422.30 → 5428.30] May he give you the desire of your heart and make all of your plans succeed.
[5428.30 → 5433.30] And together, may we shout for joy over your victory.
[5433.30 → 5437.30] And lift our banners in the name of our God.
[5437.30 → 5438.30] Amen.
[5438.30 → 5439.30] All right.
[5439.30 → 5440.30] Remain standing.
[5440.30 → 5442.30] And we'll sing our final song.
[5442.30 → 5447.30] And just a reminder, we'll have coffee and chips and other goodies in the fellowship hall after.
[5447.30 → 5448.30] We will glorify the King of Kings.
[5448.30 → 5450.30] We will glorify the Lamb.
[5450.30 → 5452.30] We will glorify the Lord of Lords.
[5452.30 → 5453.30] Who is the great I am.
[5453.30 → 5454.30] O to whom Flore in sin.
[5454.30 → 5455.30] We will glorify the Lord of Lords.
[5455.30 → 5457.30] We will glorify the Lord of Lords.
[5457.30 → 5459.30] Who is the great I am.
[5459.30 → 5464.30] O to whom Flore in sin majesty.
[5464.30 → 5465.30] We will glorify the Lord of Lords.
[5465.30 → 5466.30] We will glorify the Lord of Lords.
[5466.30 → 5467.30] Who is the great I am.
[5467.30 → 5470.30] O to whom Flore in sin majesty.
[5470.30 → 5472.30] We will grow before his throne.
[5472.30 → 5478.72] The Lord of Lords, who is the great I Am.
[5479.46 → 5488.30] For Jehovah reigns in majesty, we will walk before his throne.
[5489.16 → 5498.36] We will worship him in righteousness, we will worship him alone.
[5498.36 → 5508.44] He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, he is Lord of all who live.
[5508.88 → 5518.36] He is Lord of all the universe, all praise to him, we give.
[5518.36 → 5528.38] Hallelujah to the King of Kings, Hallelujah to the Lamb.
[5528.86 → 5538.48] Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords, who is the great I Am.
[5538.48 → 5568.46] Hallelujah to the King of Kings, Hallelujah to the King of Kings.
[5568.46 → 5598.44] Hallelujah to the King of Kings.
[5598.46 → 5600.46] Hallelujah to the King of Kings.
[5600.80 → 5616.56] Hallelujah to the King of Kings.
[5616.56 → 5646.54] Thank you.
