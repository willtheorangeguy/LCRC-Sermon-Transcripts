[288.50 --> 288.92]  Amen.
[290.88 --> 294.86]  Where two or three are gathered in the name of the Lord.
[295.00 --> 297.22]  He promises to be with us.
[297.82 --> 304.18]  So we're just going to do a song this morning to prepare our hearts for worship and remember
[304.18 --> 305.88]  that Christ is with us here.
[317.70 --> 325.34]  Jesus, the Lord,
[325.34 --> 329.04]  Jesus, the Lord,
[329.04 --> 332.50]  God, be saved.
[332.50 --> 336.30]  Jesus, the Lord,
[336.30 --> 339.94]  Jesus, the Lord,
[339.94 --> 347.42]  God, be saved.
[347.42 --> 353.92]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[353.92 --> 357.02]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[357.02 --> 360.12]  He is here.
[360.12 --> 363.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[363.42 --> 366.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[366.42 --> 369.62]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[369.62 --> 372.52]  He is here.
[372.52 --> 374.32]  Oh yes, the world,
[374.32 --> 376.32]  the Lord,
[376.32 --> 377.82]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[377.82 --> 382.82]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[382.82 --> 389.32]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[389.32 --> 392.32]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[392.32 --> 396.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[396.42 --> 397.92]  He is here.
[397.92 --> 402.92]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[402.92 --> 409.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[409.42 --> 412.42]  He is here.
[412.42 --> 415.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[415.42 --> 418.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[418.42 --> 422.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[422.42 --> 423.92]  He is here.
[423.92 --> 428.92]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[428.92 --> 430.92]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[430.92 --> 432.92]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[432.92 --> 445.42]  Jesus Christ is with us.
[445.42 --> 446.42]  Good morning.
[446.42 --> 447.42]  Good morning.
[447.42 --> 449.42]  And welcome everyone to our service today.
[449.42 --> 455.42]  We've already, by my calculations, reached roughly the midpoint of the Lenten season,
[455.42 --> 457.92]  and which of course means we're well into spring.
[457.92 --> 462.92]  But if that's that, along with the improved weather isn't enough for you,
[462.92 --> 469.42]  another sure sign of spring is the piles of stuff popping up outside many houses this weekend,
[469.42 --> 471.92]  meaning of course it's spring cleanup weekend.
[471.92 --> 477.92]  I was just saying to Mary Ann yesterday that you rarely see as many people just wandering the neighborhood,
[477.92 --> 482.42]  enjoying the fresh air, and surreptitiously or more obviously,
[482.42 --> 486.42]  combing through the piles looking for that special treasure.
[486.42 --> 487.42]  We'll do it.
[487.42 --> 488.42]  At least I do.
[488.42 --> 489.42]  Might as well admit it.
[489.42 --> 495.42]  But, you know, while we can't count on finding any special treasure from spring cleanup,
[495.42 --> 499.42]  we can count on finding treasure right in front of us.
[499.42 --> 503.92]  Therefore, they're asking our salvation through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[503.92 --> 507.42]  And it's good to take time this morning to acknowledge that,
[507.42 --> 510.42]  spend some time in praise, worship, and fellowship.
[510.42 --> 515.92]  I do hope and trust that today's service will be meaningful and enriching for all of us here this morning.
[515.92 --> 517.42]  My name is Jake Cron.
[517.42 --> 522.92]  I'll be leading us through the first part of the service this morning before Pastor Jason leads us in further lessons
[522.92 --> 526.92]  from the, at least in my experience, not so well-read book of Lamentations.
[526.92 --> 528.92]  So thank you for that courageous series.
[528.92 --> 530.92]  A few announcements before we begin.
[530.92 --> 535.92]  We do have a special presentation from World Renew that's going to take place right after the offering.
[535.92 --> 540.92]  So Mary and Vandria will come up and announce both the offering and our World Renew presenter.
[540.92 --> 544.92]  And we also have next Sunday the cross training starting.
[544.92 --> 546.42]  I'll point out myself with this.
[546.42 --> 549.92]  There's still time to sign up for that session.
[549.92 --> 552.92]  And next Sunday we have a special service in the evening.
[552.92 --> 558.92]  So we have a regular morning service, but also an evening service of lament on next Sunday night.
[558.92 --> 565.92]  A call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 107.
[565.92 --> 570.92]  O give thanks to the Lord for God is good.
[570.92 --> 573.92]  For God's steadfast love endures forever.
[573.92 --> 575.92]  Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[575.92 --> 578.92]  For God has redeemed us from trouble.
[578.92 --> 581.92]  Let us thank the Lord for God's steadfast love.
[581.92 --> 584.92]  For God's wonderful works to humankind.
[584.92 --> 591.92]  Let us come before God with thanksgiving and tell of God's deeds with songs of joy.
[591.92 --> 593.92]  Please join me in prayer.
[597.92 --> 603.92]  Everlasting God, we gather together knowing you are present among us.
[603.92 --> 613.92]  Guide our hearts and minds to listen to your word in our hearts, in our movement, in our prayers.
[613.92 --> 620.92]  Open us to new insights, to be challenged by the scriptures, to be assured by our songs,
[620.92 --> 626.92]  to be encouraged in prayer, knowing that you are making all things new, including us.
[626.92 --> 629.92]  May we be open to the spirit in this time.
[629.92 --> 630.92]  Amen.
[630.92 --> 635.92]  Now is a good time to stand if you are able to greet those around you.
[635.92 --> 636.92]  Thank you.
[665.92 --> 667.92]  With the love ofWhy, each друг at you lady, each other comes the time to listen to your graham and yaz.
[675.92 --> 681.92]  And if we were to lift him pounds, you would be thoughtful in the Jeder's disposition.

[684.58 --> 685.92]  by the large a month.
[685.92 --> 686.92]  They must take respect.
[686.92 --> 688.44]  For others may Thanks be, let us think about our names.
[688.44 --> 689.44]  One more time for the church one.
[689.44 --> 690.04]  Another one.

[694.44 --> 694.54]  For example, the Lord is not like you.
[694.54 --> 695.04]  They're hypocrites he can't looks aerosolier.
[695.04 --> 705.26]  Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[706.58 --> 711.46]  Who else could make every king bow down?
[711.46 --> 716.46]  Who else could whisper and darkness trample?
[717.52 --> 721.46]  It's only a holy God.
[721.46 --> 728.46]  What other beauty demands such praises?
[728.46 --> 733.46]  What other splendor out shines the sun?
[733.46 --> 739.46]  What other majesty rules with justice?
[739.46 --> 743.46]  Only a holy God.
[743.46 --> 754.46]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[754.46 --> 762.46]  Cry out, seek holy, forever a holy God.
[762.46 --> 769.46]  Come and worship the holy God.
[769.46 --> 781.46]  What other glory consumes my fire?
[781.46 --> 786.46]  What other power can raise the dead?
[786.46 --> 791.46]  What other name remains undefeated?
[791.46 --> 792.46]  What otherODL proud?
[792.46 --> 803.46]  Angels approach ensure so many colors online.
[803.46 --> 805.46]  Like holy, forever a holy God.
[805.46 --> 808.46]  Look for Christ Almighty, so there is no presence of heaven.
[808.46 --> 810.76]  What other grace you must whisper in nationsановily,
[810.76 --> 812.28]  That when they're always looking for sin,
[812.28 --> 817.32] поль us who discerns before the gods of heaven.
[817.32 --> 819.26]  Holy God.
[838.16 --> 842.68]  Who else could rescue me from my failure?
[842.68 --> 848.38]  Who else would offer his only Son?
[849.28 --> 853.08]  Who else invites me to call him Father?
[854.44 --> 857.54]  Only a holy God.
[858.56 --> 861.64]  Only my holy God.
[864.64 --> 868.36]  Come and behold him,
[868.36 --> 872.42]  the one and the only.
[873.16 --> 876.36]  Cry and sing holy,
[876.82 --> 880.32]  forever a holy God.
[880.66 --> 884.44]  Come and worship the holy God.
[884.44 --> 914.42]  Come and worship the holy God.
[914.44 --> 916.44]  Come and worship the holy God.
[916.44 --> 918.18]  Full confession, I didn't realize it was this long
[918.18 --> 919.16]  when I agreed to read this.
[919.28 --> 919.62]  It's like,
[920.98 --> 922.38]  it's really small text too.
[924.48 --> 926.44]  Revelation 5, first 14 verses.
[927.04 --> 929.00]  Then I saw in the right hand of him
[929.00 --> 930.06]  who sat on the throne
[930.06 --> 932.40]  a scroll with writing on both sides
[932.40 --> 933.98]  and sealed with seven seals.
[934.82 --> 936.08]  And I saw a mighty
[936.08 --> 939.20]  angel proclaiming in a loud voice,
[939.20 --> 941.44]  who is worthy to break the seals
[941.44 --> 942.34]  and open the scroll.
[943.10 --> 944.30]  But no one in heaven
[944.30 --> 945.50]  or on earth
[945.50 --> 946.70]  or under the earth
[946.70 --> 947.82]  could open the scroll
[947.82 --> 949.44]  or even look inside it.
[950.26 --> 951.90]  I wept and wept
[951.90 --> 953.40]  because no one was found
[953.40 --> 954.10]  who was worthy
[954.10 --> 955.38]  to open the scroll
[955.38 --> 956.40]  or look inside.
[957.08 --> 958.86]  Then one of the elders said to me,
[959.26 --> 960.14]  do not weep.
[960.64 --> 960.86]  See,
[961.24 --> 963.02]  the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[963.58 --> 964.66]  the root of David,
[965.02 --> 965.20]  has triumphed.
[965.20 --> 968.06]  He is able to open the scroll
[968.06 --> 969.50]  and its seven seals.
[970.70 --> 972.06]  Then I saw a lamb
[972.06 --> 973.92]  looking as if it had been slain,
[974.14 --> 975.88]  standing in the center of the throne
[975.88 --> 978.22]  encircled by the four living creatures
[978.22 --> 979.16]  and the elders.
[979.82 --> 981.14]  He had seven horns
[981.14 --> 982.36]  and seven eyes,
[982.78 --> 984.58]  which are the seven spirits of God
[984.58 --> 986.02]  sent out into all the earth.
[986.60 --> 988.30]  He came and took the scroll
[988.30 --> 989.56]  from the right hand of him
[989.56 --> 990.56]  who sat on the throne.
[991.66 --> 993.02]  And when he had taken it,
[993.30 --> 994.36]  the four living creatures
[994.36 --> 995.88]  and the 24 elders
[995.88 --> 997.38]  fell down before the lamb.
[998.14 --> 999.18]  Each one had a harp
[999.18 --> 1000.98]  and they were holding golden bowls
[1000.98 --> 1002.22]  full of incense,
[1002.66 --> 1004.14]  which are the prayers of the saints.
[1005.06 --> 1006.72]  And they sang a new song.
[1007.44 --> 1009.18]  You are worthy to take the scroll
[1009.18 --> 1010.64]  and to open its seals
[1010.64 --> 1012.24]  because you were slain
[1012.24 --> 1013.60]  and with your blood
[1013.60 --> 1015.34]  you purchased men for God
[1015.34 --> 1017.34]  from every tribe and language
[1017.34 --> 1018.94]  and people and nation.
[1019.52 --> 1021.26]  You have made them to be a kingdom
[1021.26 --> 1023.36]  and priests to serve our God
[1023.36 --> 1025.08]  and they will reign on the earth.
[1026.04 --> 1026.78]  Then I looked
[1026.78 --> 1028.84]  and heard the voice of many angels
[1028.84 --> 1031.18]  numbering thousands upon thousands.
[1031.82 --> 1032.96]  They encircled the throne
[1032.96 --> 1034.06]  and the living creatures
[1034.06 --> 1035.02]  and the elders.
[1035.78 --> 1037.32]  In a loud voice they sang,
[1037.92 --> 1039.82]  Worthy is the lamb who was slain
[1039.82 --> 1041.68]  to receive power and wealth
[1041.68 --> 1043.16]  and wisdom and strength
[1043.16 --> 1045.28]  and honor and glory and praise.
[1045.84 --> 1047.48]  Then I heard every creature
[1047.48 --> 1048.58]  in heaven and on earth
[1048.58 --> 1049.50]  and under the earth
[1049.50 --> 1050.62]  and on the sea
[1050.62 --> 1052.32]  and all that is in them singing,
[1053.10 --> 1054.66]  To him who sits on the throne
[1054.66 --> 1055.92]  and to the lamb
[1055.92 --> 1057.62]  be praise and honor
[1057.62 --> 1059.24]  and glory and power
[1059.24 --> 1060.50]  forever and ever.
[1061.46 --> 1063.02]  The four living creatures said,
[1063.44 --> 1063.64]  Amen.
[1064.50 --> 1065.84]  And the elders fell down
[1065.84 --> 1067.08]  and worshiped.
[1068.60 --> 1086.26]  We are people
[1086.26 --> 1090.00]  on a journey
[1090.00 --> 1092.92]  following where
[1092.92 --> 1097.14]  the Master walks.
[1097.64 --> 1099.52]  We are people
[1099.52 --> 1103.02]  on a journey
[1103.02 --> 1106.28]  in the shadow
[1106.28 --> 1110.44]  of the cross.
[1110.44 --> 1112.66]  What a place
[1112.66 --> 1115.96]  the face of Jesus
[1115.96 --> 1118.86]  who protects
[1118.86 --> 1122.86]  our faithful God.
[1124.08 --> 1125.74]  He who treads
[1125.74 --> 1130.02]  the road of service
[1130.02 --> 1133.10]  Christ the Lord
[1133.10 --> 1134.86]  the crucified.
[1142.66 --> 1145.96]  We are people
[1145.96 --> 1149.32]  on a journey
[1149.32 --> 1151.96]  taking up
[1151.96 --> 1155.96]  the cross of Christ.
[1156.96 --> 1158.96]  We are people
[1158.96 --> 1161.96]  on a journey
[1161.96 --> 1164.96]  moving on
[1164.96 --> 1168.96]  from death to life.
[1168.96 --> 1171.26]  We release
[1171.26 --> 1174.12]  the sin that
[1174.12 --> 1175.26]  takes us.
[1175.26 --> 1177.26]  We release
[1177.26 --> 1181.26]  and show our name.
[1181.26 --> 1183.26]  We receive
[1183.26 --> 1186.26]  the suffering
[1186.26 --> 1187.26]  Savior
[1187.26 --> 1191.26]  in our glory
[1191.26 --> 1193.26]  wealth and fame.
[1193.26 --> 1194.56]  and say
[1194.56 --> 1204.06]  We are people
[1204.06 --> 1207.56]  on a journey
[1207.56 --> 1210.56]  rising up
[1210.56 --> 1212.56]  in life reborn.
[1212.56 --> 1216.56]  We are people
[1216.56 --> 1219.56]  on a journey
[1219.56 --> 1222.86]  speaking peace
[1222.86 --> 1225.86]  accepting scorn.
[1225.86 --> 1229.86]  We are walking
[1229.86 --> 1231.86]  toward a homeland
[1231.86 --> 1235.86]  to a mystery
[1235.86 --> 1238.86]  hidden home
[1238.86 --> 1241.76]  to a kingdom
[1241.76 --> 1244.86]  coming quickly
[1244.86 --> 1248.16]  to the light
[1248.16 --> 1251.16]  of God's own throne.
[1267.16 --> 1269.04]  Jesus died on the cross
[1269.04 --> 1269.96]  for our sins.
[1270.92 --> 1272.40]  Such a simple statement
[1272.40 --> 1274.48]  holds such powerful truth.
[1274.86 --> 1276.40]  And contemplating
[1276.40 --> 1277.00]  that truth
[1277.00 --> 1278.46]  is what the 40 days
[1278.46 --> 1279.46]  of Lent are all about.
[1280.24 --> 1281.66]  It is during this time
[1281.66 --> 1282.44]  that we examine
[1282.44 --> 1283.36]  our sinful nature.
[1284.36 --> 1285.60]  It is during this time
[1285.60 --> 1286.22]  that we offer
[1286.22 --> 1287.68]  contrite prayers
[1287.68 --> 1289.32]  confessing our sins.
[1290.04 --> 1291.42]  It is during this time
[1291.42 --> 1292.40]  that we consider
[1292.40 --> 1293.02]  the magnitude
[1293.02 --> 1294.30]  of Jesus' sacrifice
[1294.30 --> 1296.66]  dying for our sins.
[1297.48 --> 1298.36]  Please join me
[1298.36 --> 1299.16]  in a prayer of confession.
[1303.24 --> 1304.26]  Like Judas
[1304.26 --> 1305.80]  God of new things
[1305.80 --> 1307.32]  we like to complain
[1307.32 --> 1309.02]  about your generous ways
[1309.02 --> 1310.30]  rather than living
[1310.30 --> 1311.28]  in your grace.
[1312.52 --> 1313.78]  The poor are always
[1313.78 --> 1314.32]  with us
[1314.32 --> 1315.06]  we believe
[1315.06 --> 1316.56]  which justifies
[1316.56 --> 1317.48]  our ignoring them.
[1318.80 --> 1319.80]  In our memories
[1319.80 --> 1321.06]  we focus on
[1321.06 --> 1321.70]  a perceived
[1321.70 --> 1322.92]  golden past
[1322.92 --> 1324.10]  and so we ignore
[1324.10 --> 1324.82]  the new things
[1324.82 --> 1325.28]  you do
[1325.28 --> 1326.44]  in our midst.
[1327.72 --> 1329.28]  We are so enamored
[1329.28 --> 1330.02]  with our achievements
[1330.02 --> 1331.32]  that we are not
[1331.32 --> 1332.18]  willing to throw them
[1332.18 --> 1332.94]  away in order
[1332.94 --> 1333.86]  to follow Jesus.
[1334.98 --> 1335.92]  Forgive us
[1335.92 --> 1337.08]  restoring God
[1337.08 --> 1338.06]  and help us
[1338.06 --> 1338.56]  to notice
[1338.56 --> 1339.12]  the kingdom
[1339.12 --> 1339.98]  springing forth
[1339.98 --> 1340.76]  in our midst.
[1341.52 --> 1342.52]  By your grace
[1342.52 --> 1343.58]  may our fears
[1343.58 --> 1344.44]  turn to faith.
[1345.16 --> 1346.26]  Our seeds of grief
[1346.26 --> 1347.96]  produce a bumper crop
[1347.96 --> 1348.54]  of joy
[1348.54 --> 1350.32]  and our tears
[1350.32 --> 1351.44]  turn into torrents
[1351.44 --> 1352.18]  of tenderness
[1352.18 --> 1353.22]  as we journey
[1353.22 --> 1354.22]  with Jesus Christ
[1354.22 --> 1355.50]  our Lord and Savior
[1355.50 --> 1356.60]  to Jerusalem.
[1357.40 --> 1357.72]  Amen.
[1357.72 --> 1361.78]  Making a way
[1361.78 --> 1363.02]  through all the foolishness
[1363.02 --> 1363.90]  and mistakes
[1363.90 --> 1364.78]  of our lives
[1364.78 --> 1365.96]  God leads us
[1365.96 --> 1366.88]  into new life
[1366.88 --> 1368.22]  where we are
[1368.22 --> 1369.24]  restored to grace
[1369.24 --> 1370.08]  to hope
[1370.08 --> 1371.34]  and to peace.
[1372.34 --> 1373.36]  Do we notice
[1373.36 --> 1374.12]  what God has done
[1374.12 --> 1374.60]  for us?
[1375.14 --> 1376.14]  What God is doing
[1376.14 --> 1376.76]  in us?
[1377.42 --> 1378.48]  This is good news
[1378.48 --> 1378.96]  for everyone.
[1379.82 --> 1380.60]  Thanks be to God
[1380.60 --> 1381.84]  we are forgiven.
[1382.40 --> 1382.60]  Amen.
[1384.10 --> 1385.20]  We have two songs
[1385.20 --> 1385.68]  of response
[1385.68 --> 1386.26]  at this time
[1386.26 --> 1387.40]  after which the children
[1387.40 --> 1389.06]  ages 3 to grade 1
[1389.06 --> 1389.66]  are dismissed
[1389.66 --> 1390.26]  to their classes.
[1396.90 --> 1397.62]  These are us.
[1397.62 --> 1412.02]  won't you see the dawn
[1412.02 --> 1415.52]  of the darkest day
[1415.52 --> 1418.50]  Christ on the road
[1418.50 --> 1421.48]  to Calvary
[1421.48 --> 1432.12]  Christ we gave
[1432.12 --> 1435.40]  sin for us
[1435.40 --> 1450.72]  took the blame
[1450.72 --> 1454.90]  bore the rock
[1454.90 --> 1457.42]  raised and forgiven
[1457.42 --> 1460.40]  at the cross
[1460.40 --> 1461.40]  to the cross
[1461.40 --> 1469.72]  O to see the pain
[1469.72 --> 1473.28]  written on your face
[1473.28 --> 1476.80]  bearing the awesome
[1476.80 --> 1480.26]  weight of sin
[1480.26 --> 1483.68]  every bid we taught
[1483.68 --> 1487.26]  every evil deed
[1487.26 --> 1490.36]  crowning your blood
[1490.36 --> 1492.26]  stained crown
[1492.26 --> 1495.00]  is the power
[1495.00 --> 1500.44]  of the cross
[1500.44 --> 1501.74]  size became
[1501.74 --> 1505.24]  sin for us
[1505.24 --> 1509.08]  took the blame
[1509.08 --> 1510.76]  took the blame
[1510.76 --> 1512.68]  bore the run
[1512.68 --> 1515.32]  pleased and forgiven
[1515.32 --> 1519.12]  at the cross
[1519.12 --> 1527.32]  o to see my name
[1527.32 --> 1530.98]  written in the wounds
[1530.98 --> 1534.40]  for through your suffering
[1534.40 --> 1537.58]  I am free
[1537.58 --> 1541.86]  death is crushed to death
[1541.86 --> 1545.36]  life is mine to live
[1545.36 --> 1548.46]  walk through your selfless
[1548.46 --> 1550.26]  life
[1550.26 --> 1553.10]  this the power
[1553.10 --> 1556.10]  of the cross
[1556.10 --> 1560.10]  son of God
[1560.10 --> 1564.10]  sing for us
[1564.10 --> 1567.10]  what a life
[1567.10 --> 1570.00]  what a cause
[1570.00 --> 1572.20]  grace  equity
[1572.20 --> 1599.06]  forเอ
[1599.06 --> 1613.60]  Meekness and majesty, manhood and deity, in perfect harmony, the man who is God.
[1613.60 --> 1628.02]  God of eternity, dwells in humility, kneels in humility and washes our feet.
[1628.02 --> 1650.90]  Oh, what a mystery, weakness and majesty, bow down and worship, for this is your God.
[1650.90 --> 1666.90]  Father's pure radiance, perfect in innocence, and learns obedience to death on a cross.
[1666.90 --> 1680.90]  Suffering to give us life, all dreams to sacrifice, and as they crucified, praise Father for him.
[1680.90 --> 1702.90]  Oh, what a mystery, weakness and majesty, bow down and worship, for this is your God.
[1702.90 --> 1721.90]  Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible, love indestructible, in frailty appears.
[1721.90 --> 1736.30]  Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly, lifts our humanity to the heights of his throne.
[1736.30 --> 1758.30]  Oh, what a mystery, weakness and majesty, bow down and worship, for this is your God.
[1758.30 --> 1762.50]  His name is God.
[1762.56 --> 1763.32]  Amen.
[1774.30 --> 1778.66]  So just Sunday school today for the younger class, not the older class.
[1778.66 --> 1789.26]  my uh my daughter is sad she likes her sunday school class which is good
[1789.26 --> 1797.72]  so today is the fourth sunday in the season of lent and in this season we are learning
[1797.72 --> 1806.38]  as a church how to lament what it means for us to cry out to god in the midst of our sorrow and our
[1806.38 --> 1814.58]  grief and our sin and in the brokenness of the world and to help us do this to help us learn what
[1814.58 --> 1821.34]  it means to lament we are doing two things together in this season one first we are in the midst of a
[1821.34 --> 1828.84]  five-week sermon series in the book of lamentation second we are going as was mentioned to have a
[1828.84 --> 1836.34]  service of lament so next sunday in the evening 7 p.m there'll be a service it will be in the fire
[1836.34 --> 1843.82]  side room and um i think this will be really a good experience for us to practice lament
[1843.82 --> 1851.02]  and i do understand that reading the book of lamentations thinking about lament even beginning
[1851.02 --> 1859.58]  to pray our own prayers of lament may be new to many of us if not all of us right we are learning
[1859.58 --> 1865.70]  a new way of interacting with god and so if this feels a little strange to you if this feels a
[1865.70 --> 1869.72]  little bit uncomfortable to you then just know that you are normal
[1869.72 --> 1878.00]  but lament is an important practice for us to learn both individually and as a church
[1878.00 --> 1886.22]  because without lament you and i are not going to have a way of talking to god about the hard and
[1886.22 --> 1894.90]  the painful places in our lives right and so a church or individuals who don't know how to how to
[1894.90 --> 1902.14]  lament it's kind of like a marriage with a couple who doesn't know how to argue right a marriage that
[1902.14 --> 1907.08]  kind of just sweeps all of the hurts all of the grievances under the rug is not a healthy marriage
[1907.08 --> 1916.00]  and so just as a husband and a wife must learn how to disagree with one another within the bounds of a
[1916.00 --> 1925.18]  loving and committed relationship so the church must learn how to protest to our heavenly father
[1925.18 --> 1933.24]  about what we are angry about what we're sad about within the bounds of his commitment and his love
[1933.24 --> 1941.16]  to us and so this morning we're working our way through lamentations and this morning we are in chapter four
[1941.16 --> 1947.32]  so i invite you to open your bibles the words will also be on the screen
[1947.32 --> 1951.24]  to lamentations it's right after jeremiah
[1951.24 --> 1955.80]  and before ezekiel
[1955.80 --> 1966.86]  this is on page 618 in your pew bible and um you know we're going to read the whole chapter it's 22 verses
[1966.86 --> 1971.72]  and so please follow along with me as i read for us
[1971.72 --> 1979.24]  how the gold has lost its luster the fine gold become dull
[1979.24 --> 1983.40]  the sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street
[1983.40 --> 1990.20]  how the precious sons of zion once worth their weight in gold are now considered as pots of clay
[1990.20 --> 1998.08]  the work of a potter's hands even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young but my people have become
[1998.08 --> 2005.40]  heartless like ostriches in the desert because of thirst the infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth
[2005.40 --> 2009.00]  the children beg for bread but no one gives it to them
[2009.00 --> 2013.56]  those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets
[2013.56 --> 2018.44]  those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps
[2018.44 --> 2026.60]  the punishment of my people is greater than that of sodom which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her
[2027.88 --> 2035.40]  their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk their bodies more rooty than rubies their appearances like sapphires
[2035.40 --> 2044.04]  but now they are blacker than soot they are not recognized in the streets their skin has shriveled on their bones it has become as dry as a stick
[2044.76 --> 2052.04]  those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine racked with hunger they waste away for lack of food from the field
[2052.60 --> 2059.96]  with their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children who became their food when my people were destroyed
[2059.96 --> 2071.16]  the wrath has given full vent the lord has given full vent to his wrath he has poured out his fierce anger he kindled the fire in zion that consumed her foundations
[2072.04 --> 2079.08]  the kings of the earth did not believe nor did any of the world's people that enemies and foes could enter the gates of jerusalem
[2079.64 --> 2087.88]  but it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed within her the blood of the righteous
[2087.88 --> 2097.88]  now they grope through the streets like men who are blind they are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments go away you are unclean
[2098.68 --> 2106.28]  men cry to them away away don't touch us when they flee and wander about people among the nation say
[2106.84 --> 2113.32]  they can stay here no longer the lord himself has scattered them he no longer watches over them
[2113.32 --> 2120.52]  the priests are shown no honor the elders no favor moreover our eyes failed looking in vain for help
[2120.52 --> 2127.40]  from our towers we watch for a nation that could not save men stalked us at every step so we could not walk
[2127.40 --> 2135.64]  in our streets our end was near our days were numbered for our end had come our pursuers were swifter than eagles
[2135.64 --> 2139.88]  in the sky they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert
[2139.88 --> 2148.52]  the lord's anointed our very life breath was caught in their traps we thought that under his shadow we
[2148.52 --> 2155.48]  would live among the nations rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom you who live in the land of us
[2156.20 --> 2160.20]  but to you also the cup will be passed you will be drunk and stripped naked
[2160.84 --> 2165.64]  o daughter of zion your punishment will end he will not prolong your exile
[2165.64 --> 2173.00]  but o daughter of edom he will punish your sin and expose your wickedness this is the word of the lord
[2175.24 --> 2178.12]  let's pray and ask for god's blessing upon his word
[2180.28 --> 2188.84]  heavenly father we ask this morning that by your mercy that you would help us to see the world that you have made rightly
[2188.84 --> 2195.48]  lord jesus help us to see and to respond to the brokenness of the world the way you do
[2197.40 --> 2201.40]  holy spirit would you open our ears our minds our hearts
[2202.36 --> 2210.68]  to be sensitive to your word and let us hear what you would have to say to us this morning we pray in jesus name and for his sake amen
[2210.68 --> 2222.68]  now i'm sure you've noticed um just this reality of life that we don't tend to notice how much we love
[2222.68 --> 2232.20]  or depend on something until that thing is missing or is taken away from us for example my son abram recently lost his iphone
[2232.20 --> 2242.04]  his second iphone it used to be so easy to manage to make plans with him just to get in touch if i needed
[2242.04 --> 2247.32]  to tell him something or ask him something but now i have to remember what it was like before we all had
[2247.32 --> 2255.24]  phones in our pockets and you had to make a plan it's super inconvenient or we might realize how much we love
[2255.24 --> 2261.80]  a restaurant or we never did realize how much we loved it until it closes and we can't eat there anymore
[2262.20 --> 2268.36]  and we feel sad about it we don't realize how much we lie on our glasses until we can't find them
[2269.64 --> 2272.76]  or how great toilet paper is until you run out
[2274.92 --> 2282.68]  likewise when life falls apart when certain things are taken away from us we see with greater clarity
[2282.68 --> 2289.72]  the things that we were depending on or how we were depending on those things right we see with greater
[2289.72 --> 2296.04]  clarity the things that we were maybe even building our lives on where we have actually placed our hope
[2297.72 --> 2305.16]  now for those of us who are christians we profess that we place our hope in god right of course i trust in
[2305.16 --> 2314.52]  god he is my rock he is my redeemer he is the one i look to for help he is my hope we would verbally profess
[2314.52 --> 2323.16]  that but i think the reality is that so often we actually place our hope in other things and when
[2323.16 --> 2332.76]  that thing is something or someone besides god that is what the bible calls idolatry and here in
[2332.76 --> 2341.08]  lamentations chapter 4 we see these many idols that the people of jerusalem had placed their hope in that was
[2341.08 --> 2349.80]  not the lord god and now and how these idols have failed to provide the hope that they were looking
[2349.80 --> 2356.92]  for and failed to provide the security and the salvation that they were hoping for and so just to
[2356.92 --> 2362.44]  make sure that you and i are on the same page as we look at this passage let me briefly share a couple
[2362.44 --> 2370.76]  things about idolatry so first here's a simple definition this comes from pastor tim keller in his book
[2371.00 --> 2380.36]  counterfeit gods he writes this an idol is anything more important to you than god anything that absorbs
[2380.36 --> 2389.16]  your heart and imagination more than god anything you seek to give you what only god can give
[2390.84 --> 2397.96]  so this is what an idol is the second thing to note is that an idol often is a good thing
[2397.96 --> 2405.96]  right it could be something as good as family or career or money relationships and all all number of
[2405.96 --> 2411.56]  things after all that is why our hearts are drawn to them in the first place because they're good
[2412.44 --> 2419.64]  but the problem happens when we elevate those good things to the place of an ultimate thing when we put
[2419.64 --> 2427.08]  them in the place of god and then when we do that what happens to god well he just kind of fades into the
[2427.08 --> 2434.12]  background of our lives we don't really give much thought to him we forget that this is god's world and that he
[2434.12 --> 2442.52]  is the only one who can truly save and who can truly satisfy us and so in our passage we're going to see three
[2442.52 --> 2450.20]  very common idols that the people of jerusalem had put their hope in and we're going to see how each of
[2450.20 --> 2458.28]  these idols ultimately fails them and we're going to see how prevalent they still are in our lives as well
[2459.80 --> 2464.92]  so that's what we're going to do we're just going to look at these three idols and then to end we're
[2464.92 --> 2471.24]  going to look at the lord jesus who is the only one who can actually save us so number one the first thing
[2471.24 --> 2480.44]  we see in our passage is the idol of material wealth and comfort for the people of jerusalem so much of
[2480.44 --> 2489.96]  their identity had become tied to their prosperity so much of their sense of significance but their wealth
[2489.96 --> 2496.04]  failed to provide the security and the peace that they were looking for so jeremiah begins his passage in
[2496.04 --> 2502.60]  the first few verses he's walking through the streets of jerusalem after the destruction of the
[2502.60 --> 2509.80]  city and he reflects on how the wealth and the prosperity that the people once looked to had not
[2509.80 --> 2515.64]  been able to save them and he first focuses on the temple itself that lies at the heart of the city and so
[2515.64 --> 2523.24]  here in verse one how the gold has lost its luster the fine gold become dull the sacred gems are scattered
[2523.24 --> 2530.84]  at every street corner and so before the destruction of the temple this temple was this glorious building
[2531.48 --> 2538.92]  it stood on an elevated place in jerusalem on mount zion it stood above all the other structures of the city
[2538.92 --> 2548.20]  and the whole thing was covered in gold the first century historian josephus wrote and described the temple he
[2548.20 --> 2558.76]  writes this the whole temple shined and dazzled the eyes of those who entered by who entered by the splendor of the gold
[2558.76 --> 2565.80]  that was on every side but then after the temple was destroyed jeremiah tells us the gold which was
[2565.80 --> 2574.28]  layered on the temple had had grown dull maybe it was covered in soot and and smoke and in dirt caked with dirt
[2574.28 --> 2582.04]  and now these precious gems of the temple what wasn't carried off into babylon lay scattered in the streets
[2584.68 --> 2595.80]  the idea is that this great wealth which was really on display and was the honor of god's people
[2596.60 --> 2603.24]  had become worthless it had failed to provide them the security in their time of need
[2603.24 --> 2611.80]  now if we also skip down to verse 5 we see how their comfortable lavish lifestyle had also failed
[2612.44 --> 2621.88]  to to secure them verse 5 says those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets those brought up in royal
[2621.88 --> 2629.72]  purple now lie in ash heaps right so those who were in positions of wealth and prestige who enjoyed all these
[2629.72 --> 2638.28]  lavish foods they were wore the fanciest clothes but not anymore right now all their prosperity has been
[2638.28 --> 2645.72]  cast aside and they are reduced to lying in the streets filthy and disheveled and conquered
[2647.56 --> 2653.88]  and all of this is nothing less than the covenantal curse and the judgment of god upon his sinful people
[2653.88 --> 2661.24]  a judgment jeremiah tells us that rivaled that of what happened to sodom centuries earlier
[2662.12 --> 2669.08]  and no amount of gold no amount of gems no amount of fine dining and fancy clothes could have delivered the
[2669.08 --> 2679.08]  city or saved the people of god and in so often it turns out that god does not honor what we honor god doesn't
[2679.08 --> 2689.96]  hold in in high value what we often value and jeremiah had warned the people of jerusalem about
[2689.96 --> 2697.40]  their idol of material wealth and that it would lead to their downfall so in jeremiah chapter 6 verse 13 he
[2697.40 --> 2705.24]  writes from the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain that's how he describes the people of jerusalem
[2705.24 --> 2712.68]  and sadly god's people had to discover the hard way the hopelessness of trusting in their wealth
[2713.80 --> 2722.20]  and god takes these things that we hold to be valuable apart from him and he proves their worthlessness
[2723.72 --> 2733.00]  and so friends now for us as well we need to be wary and careful about looking to comfort and wealth
[2733.00 --> 2740.44]  to find our ultimate hope and this is so easy for us to do i'm guilty of this right so we imagine if we
[2740.44 --> 2748.52]  just hit that salary figure if we just purchase can purchase that nice home or drive that nice car or own
[2748.52 --> 2755.16]  that you know beautiful wardrobe then i would be satisfied i would be happy i would be fulfilled
[2755.16 --> 2764.76]  but we know the reality is that wealth is an elusive vital right it's so easily just slips away
[2767.00 --> 2774.36]  and it is a demanding master because you always need to get more and it becomes all consuming and so we
[2774.36 --> 2781.72]  see people go into massive debt buying things they can't afford we see the cost of anxiety that it produces
[2781.72 --> 2787.16]  in us and then in the disappointment when those things don't deliver the happiness that we thought
[2787.16 --> 2792.36]  they would and so jeremiah first shows us that material wealth is a counterfeit god
[2793.32 --> 2802.36]  it is a false hope it can't save us it can't secure us and then so now the second idol that we see here
[2802.36 --> 2809.00]  is the idol of religious piety and so the people of jerusalem they place their hope not only in their wealth
[2809.00 --> 2817.32]  their prestige but also in their religious practices in their rituals right they believed hey we cut the
[2817.32 --> 2826.12]  temple we we do the sacrifices we have the priests we have the law we have the prophets we are invincible
[2827.08 --> 2835.88]  no one could conquer us right this is the city of god and so much of their sense of security was tied
[2835.88 --> 2844.84]  to their religious religiosity but their religious piety also fails to save them because for all of
[2844.84 --> 2852.04]  their religious acts they were just hypocritical performances right the people didn't truly worship
[2852.04 --> 2859.08]  god they didn't truly trust him from their heart and so their religious piety all of this just amounted
[2859.08 --> 2866.44]  to nothing and jeremiah is clear as he has been throughout the book of lamentations that the
[2866.44 --> 2874.76]  destruction that has come on israel is the fault of all the people heading headlong into sin but here in
[2874.76 --> 2885.48]  chapter 4 he especially puts the fault on the religious leaders so look with me at verse 13 jeremiah writes this
[2885.48 --> 2893.88]  but it happened because of the sins of her prophets the iniquities of her priests who shed within her the blood of the righteous
[2895.88 --> 2906.84]  so the priests the prophets the religious leaders bear a special and unique blame the sin of the people actually rested on their shoulders
[2906.84 --> 2914.20]  because in those years before the babylonian invasion they had failed to call israel to repentance
[2915.08 --> 2922.92]  which was one of their main jobs and instead they had given false assurances to god's people in their sin
[2924.52 --> 2930.44]  jeremiah chapter 6 you know looking at that passage again prophets and priests alike all practice deceit
[2930.44 --> 2936.76]  they dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious peace peace they say when there is no peace
[2939.96 --> 2948.20]  so the prophets the priests according to jeremiah they bear responsibility for the destruction of of jerusalem
[2949.88 --> 2956.68]  and notice that in the wake of this disaster these leaders lost any honor that they once had
[2956.68 --> 2963.16]  among the people right as they wander through the streets defiled by the blood that is on their hands
[2964.52 --> 2971.32]  and they're described as being ceremonially ceremonially unclean like like a leper like with skin disease
[2971.32 --> 2979.08]  and the people are shouting at them stay away from us you're unclean don't touch us don't come near us we
[2979.08 --> 2986.44]  don't want your uncleanliness of course this is ironic it was the priests who were called upon to
[2986.44 --> 2994.52]  make pronouncements about what was clean and unclean and now these leaders are seen who were the holiest
[2994.52 --> 3006.04]  people of israel are now seen as the most unholy and so how about us we need to be wary of placing our hope
[3006.04 --> 3013.96]  in our own religious performance right when we come to church on sundays when we read our bibles and we pray
[3013.96 --> 3021.40]  and we give offerings and we serve these are all good things but if we don't do these things as genuine
[3021.40 --> 3029.96]  acts of worship but only maybe as a means to keep god in our pocket our our religious piety becomes idolatry
[3031.16 --> 3037.88]  right that's when we are actually looking at our own righteousness as our functional savior as the thing that
[3037.88 --> 3045.16]  we're trusting in before god and that is a terrible place to be why is it terrible
[3046.28 --> 3054.12]  because if it's on us and it rests on how holy we are and in the acts of religious piety that we perform
[3054.12 --> 3061.64]  then there will always be a lingering sense of fear and doubt did i do enough am i doing it right
[3061.64 --> 3070.20]  and instead of serving god we end up just trying to serve ourselves through religious activity and
[3070.20 --> 3074.76]  we become no better than those inept prophets and priests of jeremiah's day
[3076.20 --> 3080.12]  and of course when it comes to religious leaders in our day you know
[3082.44 --> 3088.20]  it was the job of the priests as it is the job of pastors and other religious leaders today to point the
[3088.20 --> 3098.28]  people to jesus christ there's a um a story i heard about two women who had been to charles spurgeon's
[3098.84 --> 3105.88]  church in london he was a very famous preacher and as they were leaving the service one of the women
[3105.88 --> 3111.96]  said to the other well what did you think of him and the other lady said who she said well spurgeon of course
[3112.76 --> 3116.84]  and she said well to be perfectly honest with you i wasn't thinking about spurgeon
[3116.84 --> 3124.84]  i was thinking about god and that is what pastors ought to do right to preach and to lead in such a
[3124.84 --> 3133.40]  way not to honor themselves not to lift themselves up but to point to jesus the only one who can save we
[3133.40 --> 3140.92]  we tend in our culture today um of celebrity to elevate a pastor to a position
[3140.92 --> 3142.92]  we're putting our trust in him
[3142.92 --> 3144.92]  where we're putting our trust in him
[3145.72 --> 3146.92]  and this is not good this is not healthy
[3146.92 --> 3154.92]  the third idol that we see here in lamentations four is the idol of political power
[3155.08 --> 3160.92]  now the people of jerusalem they trusted in their wealth
[3161.48 --> 3166.92]  they trusted in their religious leaders their religious piety and they also trusted in
[3166.92 --> 3174.60]  their political power they trusted in themselves their king and they trusted in other nations
[3174.60 --> 3182.12]  to deliver them from the invading babylonian army so much of their hope was tied up with political power
[3183.00 --> 3190.92]  but political power failed to deliver them so in verses 17 to 20 in our passage jeremiah
[3190.92 --> 3197.08]  he describes the final moments right before the utter destruction of jerusalem the babylonian army had
[3197.08 --> 3203.08]  surrounded the city of jerusalem they had laid siege through the city and while they were under siege
[3203.08 --> 3209.48]  the people of the city were looking to see who would rescue them so look with me at verse 17.
[3210.44 --> 3217.08]  it says moreover our eyes failed looking in vain for help from our towers we watched for a nation
[3217.08 --> 3223.80]  that could not save us and so we have this this picture of someone up on this tower in the city
[3225.32 --> 3232.68]  looking out watching the horizon straining their eyes in vain hoping that a nation would come to
[3232.68 --> 3239.72]  rescue them just in time take on the babylonians put an end to their siege and throughout the old
[3239.72 --> 3246.36]  testament god constantly urged the people through his prophets don't trust in these sort of political
[3246.36 --> 3254.44]  alliances trust in me god said over and over and if they had just turned to the lord
[3255.96 --> 3262.04]  he would have come god would have answered the cries of his people he would have saved them
[3262.76 --> 3269.96]  but the people never cried out to him and in their direst moment as babylon is standing around the city
[3269.96 --> 3277.08]  as they are starving to death they are once again persisting and putting their trust in political power
[3278.12 --> 3283.24]  for them they were looking to egypt egypt was the nation that had failed to save them
[3285.00 --> 3289.00]  but also their king they were looking to their king i mean come on this is jerusalem right
[3289.00 --> 3296.92]  we have god's anointed king the king of david king zedekiah at the time he can take on the babylonians
[3298.04 --> 3306.36]  well no what did zedekiah do he tried to run away he tried to flee the city instead of getting away he
[3306.36 --> 3314.84]  was captured by the enemy terrible things happened to him and in shame he was led to babylon in chains
[3314.84 --> 3325.80]  how about us we too need to be wary of placing our hope in kings and political power right and
[3326.52 --> 3333.80]  unfortunately in our politically charged climate right now you know whether we identify as liberal
[3333.80 --> 3338.44]  or conservative or another party so much stock is placed on politics
[3338.44 --> 3346.36]  which party will be in power who the prime minister will be what policies will be enacted
[3347.40 --> 3352.20]  and again these are good things but we've made them ultimate things
[3353.48 --> 3361.00]  right politics has become an idol something that we look to to save us something that we put our ultimate hope in
[3361.00 --> 3371.16]  and so we have seen these three major idols that the israelites were putting their hope in instead of
[3371.16 --> 3377.40]  turning to the lord instead of trusting the lord to save and if we're honest these are some of the same
[3377.40 --> 3386.76]  idols that we still today continue to put our hope in when i was a pastor at my last church at emmanuel in
[3386.76 --> 3392.44]  richmond richmond who was a guy kind of part of our leadership team wasn't an elder his name was edward
[3393.00 --> 3398.60]  and edward was really gifted at making ministry plans he was a businessman he loved to make these plans
[3399.96 --> 3405.64]  for what we wanted to do in ministry so he would say we'd be meeting talking about things he'd say okay
[3405.64 --> 3411.88]  here's what we're going to do this is plan a and if that doesn't work here's our backup plan plan b
[3412.60 --> 3418.68]  and if that doesn't work we're going to resort to plan c and so on and so on and literally one time
[3418.68 --> 3424.28]  he said to me if those five plans don't work there is plan f and i've thought this all through
[3426.04 --> 3430.52]  and for edward you know each of these plans was actually seeking the lord's help seeking the
[3430.52 --> 3435.08]  lord's guidance and there's nothing wrong with backup plans there's nothing wrong with contingencies
[3435.88 --> 3442.84]  but what israel was doing was they were trusting in their wealth and in the temple and in their
[3442.84 --> 3448.76]  priests and in their king and in their alliances and they were clearly turning everywhere they could
[3448.76 --> 3457.08]  plans a b c d etc except to the lord they had all of these things they were looking to and trusting in
[3457.08 --> 3462.76]  and in the end none of these things could save them and so the question for us to reflect upon
[3463.80 --> 3469.72]  is whether we see jesus christ in the same light right when we think about what it means for us to put
[3469.72 --> 3479.64]  our hope in jesus to save us or to be satisfied in jesus does that mean that jesus is your only hope
[3479.64 --> 3492.12]  in life and in death or is he functionally plan f how does jesus stack up against all the other plans
[3492.12 --> 3501.96]  all the other hopes in your life is he someone that you can really trust to save and to satisfy and to
[3501.96 --> 3508.12]  deliver you even if the earth should give way and the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea
[3509.64 --> 3515.80]  right friends god gives us so many good things but at the end of the day none of those things whether
[3515.80 --> 3525.24]  it's relationships or a job or material comforts or a pastor or prime minister nothing can truly bear
[3525.24 --> 3532.44]  the full weight of our needs of our souls other than jesus christ and that leads us to our final point
[3532.44 --> 3538.36]  that only the lord can save and we'll just read here verse 22
[3540.84 --> 3552.36]  where god says your punishment will end daughter zion he as god will not prolong your exile see the good
[3552.36 --> 3560.20]  news the glimmer of hope as small as it is in lamentations chapter 4 is that the punishment is over
[3560.20 --> 3568.76]  right that in just a matter of time after 70 years of exile the lord would restore his people back to the
[3568.76 --> 3578.36]  land of promise they will experience redemption and renewal one day and ultimately 600 700 years later
[3578.92 --> 3584.84]  god would send a savior and the lord jesus christ would take upon himself a far greater judgment
[3584.84 --> 3593.00]  than what befell wicked israel you see like all the things that israel hoped in were counterfeit gods
[3594.12 --> 3599.96]  their prophets told god's people only what they wanted to hear the priests were negligent in their
[3599.96 --> 3607.08]  duties the kings were wicked but in christ we have the true prophet the true priest the true king
[3607.08 --> 3617.40]  who is only who is really able to save us right jesus is the true savior the true king who didn't flee
[3617.40 --> 3624.04]  from the darkness but who came into our darkness who came into our sin into the brokenness of the world to
[3624.04 --> 3634.84]  rescue us and he let that darkness overwhelm him right he he died on the cross absorbing all that darkness and
[3634.84 --> 3642.44]  sin on himself and then he rose victorious through it he conquered our enemies of sin and death
[3644.28 --> 3649.96]  friends jesus is the only one who is strong enough and wise enough and good enough and faithful enough
[3650.68 --> 3659.80]  to put all of our hope in to build our lives upon and he invites us to come to him to worship him to put our
[3659.80 --> 3667.64]  trust in him to be his beloved people to cry out to him because he as we read in revelation is the one
[3667.64 --> 3677.72]  who is worthy to save i want to end just with this pastor tim keller again writes in his book counterfeit
[3677.72 --> 3684.52]  gods and he says this the only way to free ourselves from the destructive influence of counterfeit gods
[3684.52 --> 3693.32]  is to turn back to the true living god he is the only one who if you find him can truly fulfill you and if you fail him
[3693.96 --> 3695.00]  can truly forgive you
[3698.76 --> 3699.72]  and lament
[3701.32 --> 3702.36]  acknowledges
[3703.40 --> 3707.48]  the worthlessness of the things that we falsely put our trust in
[3707.48 --> 3717.72]  and lament frees us then to place our hopes in the one true and living god okay so would you please pray with me
[3723.56 --> 3732.44]  father we ask for your help would you drive us to yourself would you show us the ways in which we are trusting
[3732.44 --> 3736.28]  in the counterfeit gods of this world to save us
[3737.00 --> 3743.88]  which are not able to bear that weight remind us lord that there is salvation in no other name under
[3743.88 --> 3747.32]  heaven and on earth than the name of our lord jesus christ
[3749.16 --> 3754.68]  lord help us to trust in you help us to lament the brokenness we see in our own lives and in our
[3754.68 --> 3760.04]  world the things that we falsely put our trust in that let us down and help us lord to cry out to you
[3760.04 --> 3762.20]  we pray in jesus name amen
[3766.04 --> 3774.04]  all right so let's um stand together let's sing our song of response
[3774.04 --> 3780.04]  our song this Amen
[3791.72 --> 3796.04]  so
[3796.04 --> 3807.80]  Oh Lord our God, to you we come
[3807.80 --> 3813.20]  Will you still hide your face?
[3813.20 --> 3820.12]  We cry before you and on our knees we pray
[3820.12 --> 3824.26]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3826.04 --> 3832.40]  Our sorrows leave us weak and warm
[3832.40 --> 3837.64]  Surrounded by our fears
[3837.64 --> 3844.42]  We look to heaven through feeble faith and tears
[3844.42 --> 3848.68]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3848.68 --> 3854.10]  Till your glory fills our eyes
[3854.10 --> 3859.26]  And our faith is down to sight
[3859.26 --> 3864.46]  Till our thirsty souls are satisfied
[3864.46 --> 3870.10]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3870.10 --> 3882.46]  Our foes and enemies rejoice In justice seems to reign
[3882.46 --> 3890.62]  Lord, we are shaken and we are losing strength
[3890.62 --> 3894.82]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3894.82 --> 3904.82]  Till your glory fills our eyes And our faith is turned to sight
[3904.82 --> 3911.18]  Till our thirsty souls are satisfied
[3911.18 --> 3916.34]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3916.34 --> 3925.50]  We will trust your steadfast love
[3925.50 --> 3933.66]  How long, oh Lord, how long?
[3933.66 --> 3938.82]  We will trust your steadfast love
[3938.82 --> 3943.98]  Your grace will be our song
[3943.98 --> 3945.98]  We will bring new mercies And our mercy
[3945.98 --> 3950.34]  We will bring new mercies With every rising sun
[3950.34 --> 3951.34]  How long, oh Lord, how long?

[4155.34 --> 4161.34]  Churches don't often spend a lot of time in lamentations or lamenting
[4161.34 --> 4165.34]  Sometimes the sound guys don't want me to touch it, so okay
[4165.34 --> 4171.34]  Really glad to be here and thank you so much music team for the worship for the music
[4171.34 --> 4176.34]  And especially to Maryam and Don for their hospitality

[4180.34 --> 4182.34]  So I appreciate that very much
[4182.34 --> 4189.34]  So as Maryam mentioned, World Renew works around the world in many different countries

[4200.34 --> 4205.34]  So, World Renew, a ministry of the Christian Reformed Church
[4205.34 --> 4208.34]  Something that I have the privilege of working with
[4208.34 --> 4212.34]  And in fact, in the mid 90s is when I worked
[4212.34 --> 4216.34]  Did some initial work more in the diaconal area in North America
[4216.34 --> 4219.34]  And then later on the past eight years or so
[4219.34 --> 4224.34]  I've been providing support for our work in West Africa
[4224.34 --> 4235.34]  So the overview of the region is that the World Renew has various staff people
[4235.34 --> 4239.34]  But the work is done through partnerships
[4239.34 --> 4246.34]  So this would be a church or a Christian organization in West Africa
[4246.34 --> 4254.34]  That is located in one of these countries in Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Sierra Leone and Senegal
[4254.34 --> 4260.34]  If you've been watching the news at all, you know that in Mali and Niger especially
[4260.34 --> 4262.34]  And Nigeria as well
[4262.34 --> 4268.34]  Civil conflict is very, very common and an unfortunate part of life
[4268.34 --> 4275.34]  The work there through these partner organizations of local people is in capacity building
[4275.34 --> 4279.34]  That's building the strength of the organizations and their ability to do their work
[4279.34 --> 4285.34]  Women's health, abuse prevention, food security, agriculture, economic empowerment
[4285.34 --> 4288.34]  And water sanitation and relief
[4288.34 --> 4292.34]  So for an example in Mali
[4292.34 --> 4297.34]  There is outreach to some 85,000 different people
[4297.34 --> 4301.34]  This has to do with outreach in the church areas
[4301.34 --> 4308.34]  As well as women's health, agriculture, justice, food access and gender equality
[4308.34 --> 4314.34]  So if you think about justice, Micah 6-8 makes it very clear to us
[4314.34 --> 4318.34]  To us that what does the Lord require of us as people
[4318.34 --> 4321.34]  To do justice, love mercy and walk humbly
[4321.34 --> 4323.34]  So there's a personal side of that
[4323.34 --> 4325.34]  There's a community side of that
[4325.34 --> 4330.34]  And then there is a justice that's kind of a why question
[4330.34 --> 4332.34]  If someone is really poor we can help them out
[4332.34 --> 4334.34]  We can give them a loaf of bread
[4334.34 --> 4338.34]  And we can maybe help them start a job, get a job or start a business or something
[4338.34 --> 4344.34]  But the underlying justice question is why is this person poor after all
[4344.34 --> 4349.34]  Are there some things, injustice going on in society that keeps that poverty going?
[4349.34 --> 4353.34]  So those are some of the things that we are addressing in some of these countries as well
[4353.34 --> 4356.34]  Here's some pictures from Mali
[4356.34 --> 4358.34]  Again in West Africa
[4358.34 --> 4361.34]  Nigeria
[4361.34 --> 4364.34]  This is a slightly larger program
[4364.34 --> 4367.34]  The young fellow that you see there is in a wheelchair
[4367.34 --> 4370.34]  This is part of the ministry of this
[4370.34 --> 4374.34]  One of the organizations called Beautiful Gate Initiative
[4374.34 --> 4380.34]  That provides wheelchairs, repairs and construction of these kind of equipment
[4380.34 --> 4387.34]  So trauma care, disaster, village savings and loans, nutrition, sanitation, healthcare
[4387.34 --> 4391.34]  You can see that this program list is slightly different from the last one
[4391.34 --> 4395.34]  I would really ask you to keep all these countries in your prayers
[4395.34 --> 4400.34]  Nigeria suffers greatly from the inter-religious strife
[4400.34 --> 4407.34]  That is ongoing and extremely difficult for the people that live and work there
[4407.34 --> 4410.34]  A couple of pictures of Nigeria
[4410.34 --> 4414.34]  And much more to say of course on every one of these countries
[4414.34 --> 4418.34]  Niger is in the general neighborhood there as well
[4418.34 --> 4423.34]  And in the program they also work with different organizations
[4423.34 --> 4426.34]  In a variety of different areas as you can see
[4426.34 --> 4432.34]  The Christian witness is a critical part in terms of countries
[4432.34 --> 4435.34]  All of these countries are majority Muslim countries
[4435.34 --> 4440.34]  So for them to know that the church is interested in the physical needs of people
[4440.34 --> 4443.34]  And as well as the spiritual needs in working with the church
[4443.34 --> 4446.34]  To provide a well-rounded holistic kind of ministry
[4449.34 --> 4452.34]  Life there is very basic
[4452.34 --> 4457.34]  And where if you want to start dinner you have to go out and find some wood first
[4457.34 --> 4460.34]  And life is challenging
[4460.34 --> 4464.34]  If you want a bit of water you may have to walk a kilometer to the well
[4464.34 --> 4467.34]  Or to a local stream to find it
[4467.34 --> 4472.34]  Sierra Leone, a country where I have the privilege of doing work
[4472.34 --> 4478.34]  You can see these ladies are working to spread grain out on a floor
[4478.34 --> 4481.34]  They are drying it so that it can be threshed
[4481.34 --> 4484.34]  And it can be separated from the husk
[4484.34 --> 4490.34]  And so this is having to do with an agricultural program that goes on there
[4490.34 --> 4492.34]  There is leadership development work
[4492.34 --> 4496.34]  Savings and loans, agriculture and justice awareness
[4496.34 --> 4500.34]  As well as the construction of infrastructure projects
[4500.34 --> 4503.34]  Such as drying floors as you see there
[4503.34 --> 4509.34]  Multi-purpose community buildings, toilets, schools, clinics and water wells
[4509.34 --> 4514.34]  So this is the kind of work that the partner organization there
[4514.34 --> 4520.34]  It was actually one of if not the first international outreach of the Christian Reformed Church
[4520.34 --> 4525.34]  And the Christian Reformed, I should say, CRWRC back then
[4525.34 --> 4528.34]  In Sierra Leone in the 80's
[4528.34 --> 4531.34]  So this was something that was there
[4531.34 --> 4533.34]  A couple pictures from Sierra Leone
[4533.34 --> 4538.34]  You can see the rice paddies there where people are planting rice
[4538.34 --> 4542.34]  In Senegal, slightly different format here
[4542.34 --> 4544.34]  But they also have a number of different partners
[4544.34 --> 4548.34]  Including Youth with a Mission, Assemblies of God
[4548.34 --> 4550.34]  And a couple of other church organizations
[4550.34 --> 4554.34]  The Christian Reformed Church, by the way, is very strong in Sierra Leone
[4554.34 --> 4555.34]  And other countries
[4555.34 --> 4558.34]  Its presence is not quite as strong as that
[4558.34 --> 4561.34]  Also working in agriculture and nutrition
[4561.34 --> 4567.34]  Some pictures here from the work of World Renew through its partners
[4567.34 --> 4569.34]  In Senegal
[4569.34 --> 4574.34]  So to, again, to outline some of the challenges
[4574.34 --> 4576.34]  And request for your prayers
[4576.34 --> 4579.34]  Religious conflict as I had mentioned before
[4579.34 --> 4584.34]  Just because Christians are a minority in all of these countries
[4584.34 --> 4590.34]  Does not mean that the relationships between Christians and Muslims are the same
[4590.34 --> 4597.34]  So in Sierra Leone, for example, the relationships between Christians and Muslims is very good
[4597.34 --> 4602.34]  In fact, people will have village meetings that have attended many, many of them
[4602.34 --> 4606.34]  Where the local religious leaders, Muslim and Christian
[4606.34 --> 4609.34]  Will both provide some kind of introduction to the meeting
[4609.34 --> 4611.34]  And do some kind of prayer together
[4611.34 --> 4615.34]  So the people are not killing each other over religion
[4615.34 --> 4618.34]  And fortunately in Canada, it's also that way
[4618.34 --> 4620.34]  And we take that for granted
[4620.34 --> 4623.34]  Other countries that I've mentioned
[4623.34 --> 4626.34]  Nigeria and Mali and Niger
[4626.34 --> 4628.34]  This conflict is much more pronounced
[4628.34 --> 4631.34]  So again, there's differences in each country
[4631.34 --> 4636.34]  The humanitarian crises, huge issues ongoing
[4636.34 --> 4639.34]  In terms of relief needs and war
[4639.34 --> 4643.34]  And of course, climate change impacts around the world
[4643.34 --> 4646.34]  Impacting poverty and food insecurity
[4646.34 --> 4651.34]  And also political instabilities that you may have heard of
[4651.34 --> 4654.34]  So the vision for the future
[4654.34 --> 4657.34]  Is increasing efforts in West Africa
[4657.34 --> 4662.34]  And this is only possible, of course, due to the donations
[4662.34 --> 4664.34]  And the generosity to World Renew
[4664.34 --> 4668.34]  To continue its work, not just in East Africa
[4668.34 --> 4669.34]  Sorry, West Africa
[4669.34 --> 4671.34]  But also East and Southern Africa
[4671.34 --> 4673.34]  And Asia and Latin America
[4673.34 --> 4676.34]  So the focus areas are really very similar
[4676.34 --> 4679.34]  We're moving along in the same partnership model
[4679.34 --> 4683.34]  To take care of food issues and justice issues
[4683.34 --> 4686.34]  And savings and loans and water resources
[4686.34 --> 4690.34]  And building capacity of churches and organizations
[4690.34 --> 4693.34]  So this is a big thank you to you for your prayers
[4693.34 --> 4695.34]  And your supports
[4695.34 --> 4700.34]  And also an encouragement to be looking at your neighbors
[4700.34 --> 4701.34]  Right here in Delta
[4701.34 --> 4703.34]  How is it that you, a church
[4703.34 --> 4704.34]  How are you known?
[4704.34 --> 4707.34]  Oh, I know the Ladner CRC because they
[4707.34 --> 4709.34]  And fill in the blank
[4709.34 --> 4711.34]  What is it that you are known for?
[4711.34 --> 4716.34]  What kind of evidences of the love of Christ
[4716.34 --> 4718.34]  Are evident to your neighbors physically
[4718.34 --> 4720.34]  Right close by around here
[4720.34 --> 4722.34]  As well as in the general area
[4722.34 --> 4724.34]  And I know that there's a lot going on
[4724.34 --> 4725.34]  I just want to encourage you
[4725.34 --> 4728.34]  To be that salt and light in this neighborhood
[4728.34 --> 4730.34]  Because West Africa is a far way away
[4730.34 --> 4732.34]  And there's good things going on there
[4732.34 --> 4734.34]  And your work here in the community
[4734.34 --> 4736.34]  Is just as important
[4736.34 --> 4737.34]  So God bless you
[4737.34 --> 4738.34]  And thank you
[4738.34 --> 4739.34]  Thank you
[4739.34 --> 4756.34]  Thank you Daniel for that
[4756.34 --> 4761.34]  It's good to get little insights into the work that World Renew does around the world
[4761.34 --> 4764.34]  And looking forward to some more information after the service
[4764.34 --> 4769.34]  It's time for bringing our communal prayers to God
[4769.34 --> 4772.34]  So I ask you to join me at this time in prayer
[4772.34 --> 4778.34]  Sojourning God
[4778.34 --> 4779.34]  Sojourning God
[4779.34 --> 4781.34]  As we move through the halfway point of Lent
[4781.34 --> 4783.34]  Journeying toward the cross at Calvary
[4783.34 --> 4787.34]  We remember where we have gone astray on our own journey of faith
[4787.34 --> 4790.34]  At times we have taken you for granted
[4790.34 --> 4792.34]  We have taken the church for granted
[4792.34 --> 4795.34]  We have assured ourselves that we are good people
[4795.34 --> 4797.34]  And that we do good things
[4797.34 --> 4801.34]  Remind us that the journey is as important as the destination
[4801.34 --> 4804.34]  We are called to help others in this world
[4804.34 --> 4806.34]  Not only to know you
[4806.34 --> 4808.34]  But to know your love through our love of them
[4808.34 --> 4811.34]  Call us to truly love our neighbor
[4811.34 --> 4813.34]  In which we take notice of their needs
[4813.34 --> 4819.34]  Understand the systems and structures in place that continue to oppress and harm
[4819.34 --> 4821.34]  And work for justice in this world
[4821.34 --> 4823.34]  For this life matters
[4823.34 --> 4826.34]  It is in this life that we measure ourselves
[4826.34 --> 4828.34]  Whether we have lived into your ways
[4828.34 --> 4833.34]  It is in this life that we have the opportunity to practice hospitality
[4833.34 --> 4834.34]  Welcome the stranger
[4834.34 --> 4836.34]  Lift up the poor
[4836.34 --> 4837.34]  Work for justice
[4837.34 --> 4839.34]  And pursue peace
[4839.34 --> 4842.34]  God of healing
[4842.34 --> 4846.34]  We seek your light to shine upon those who are facing surgery
[4846.34 --> 4848.34]  Or awaiting test results
[4848.34 --> 4851.34]  Or whose healing process is slower than expected
[4851.34 --> 4854.34]  Overcome any fears of darkness
[4854.34 --> 4857.34]  With the light of Christ's presence and promises
[4857.34 --> 4861.34]  We pray this morning for Michael Wayne DeVos
[4861.34 --> 4865.34]  As the doctors and family consider treatment options for him
[4865.34 --> 4870.34]  Please grant them and Michael peace in their decisions
[4870.34 --> 4874.34]  We pray for a speedy recovery for Pastor Jeff
[4874.34 --> 4879.34]  May his medical leave be a time of true healing and renewed strength
[4879.34 --> 4883.34]  We pray also for Robin's sister Judy
[4883.34 --> 4885.34]  Battling with MS in Burnaby
[4885.34 --> 4889.34]  And Lord we just pray you'll walk alongside Judy in this difficult time
[4889.34 --> 4897.34]  And also with Robin as she struggles to support her sister in a community that's far away
[4897.34 --> 4899.34]  The God of her said
[4899.34 --> 4902.34]  Merciful God we continue to pray for an end to war
[4902.34 --> 4906.34]  We think especially of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza
[4906.34 --> 4910.34]  May you grant wisdom and intention to the leaders involved
[4910.34 --> 4915.34]  So the recent efforts at peace take hold into a lasting end to conflict
[4915.34 --> 4918.34]  And a way forward for those regions without violence
[4918.34 --> 4925.34]  We pray for your grace and mercy to be on those in Myanmar affected by the deadly earthquake two days ago
[4925.34 --> 4929.34]  With aftershocks threatening damaged structures
[4929.34 --> 4933.34]  Please protect the rescuers as they continue the search for survivors
[4933.34 --> 4939.34]  Be near them as they celebrate any that are found alive and mourn those who perished
[4941.34 --> 4944.34]  Empowering God we pray for Resonate Global Mission
[4944.34 --> 4947.34]  And in particular work of the Umrans in Egypt
[4947.34 --> 4950.34]  May they feel our prayers and gifts
[4950.34 --> 4954.34]  And be strengthened and encouraged in their efforts to spread your gospel in Egypt
[4954.34 --> 4963.34]  We also pray for World Renew whose work to end to provide aid and support to change lives and communities across the globe
[4963.34 --> 4971.34]  Becomes even more important with the overall reduction in funds available from other organizations such as USAID
[4971.34 --> 4977.34]  God of wisdom we pray for our congregation and its work in this community
[4977.34 --> 4983.34]  May we make good decisions in how to be effective stewards and ambassadors of your kingdom
[4983.34 --> 4986.34]  May we be encouraged and strengthened by your spirit
[4986.34 --> 4987.34]  May we be encouraged and strengthened by your spirit
[4987.34 --> 4988.34]  May we be encouraged and strengthened by your spirit
[4988.34 --> 4990.34]  Be near us Lord through this coming week
[4990.34 --> 4995.34]  And we offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate name of Jesus
[4995.34 --> 4997.34]  The light of this world, Amen
[4997.34 --> 5009.34]  Please stand
[5009.34 --> 5020.34]  And we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us as we seek to be His servants, His hands and feet in the world
[5020.34 --> 5027.34]  And again, reminder, go ahead after the service, grab some coffee if you'd like and come back
[5027.34 --> 5031.34]  And we'll hear more about what's happening through World Renew
[5031.34 --> 5036.34]  So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing
[5036.34 --> 5042.34]  To Him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before His glorious presence
[5042.34 --> 5044.34]  Without fault and with great joy
[5044.34 --> 5049.34]  To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority
[5049.34 --> 5054.34]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages, now and forevermore
[5054.34 --> 5056.34]  Amen
[5056.34 --> 5059.34]  So yeah, remain standing and we'll sing our final song
[5059.34 --> 5081.34]  The Lord's blessing
[5081.34 --> 5088.34]  A thousand generations falling down in worship
[5088.34 --> 5094.70]  To sing the song of ages to the Lamb.
[5094.70 --> 5101.38]  And all who've gone before us, and all who will believe,
[5101.38 --> 5107.70]  To sing the song of ages to the Lamb.
[5107.70 --> 5116.30]  Your name is the highest, your name is the greatest, your name
[5116.30 --> 5121.14]  Stands above them all.
[5121.14 --> 5129.86]  All thrones and dominions, all powers and positions, your name
[5129.86 --> 5136.66]  Stands above them all in the angels' pride.
[5136.66 --> 5143.34]  Holy, all creation cries.
[5143.34 --> 5150.18]  Holy, you are lifted high.
[5150.18 --> 5158.18]  Holy, holy forever.
[5158.18 --> 5167.02]  If you've been forgiven, and if you've been redeemed,
[5167.02 --> 5173.86]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb.
[5173.86 --> 5179.86]  And if you walk in freedom, and if you bear His name,
[5179.86 --> 5185.86]  Sing the song forever to the Lamb.
[5185.86 --> 5192.70]  We'll sing the song forever and the Lamb.
[5192.70 --> 5194.70]  And the angels cry.
[5194.70 --> 5200.70]  Holy, all creation cries.
[5200.70 --> 5206.70]  Holy, you are lifted high.
[5206.70 --> 5217.54]  Holy, holy forever.
[5217.54 --> 5220.54]  Hear your people sing.
[5220.54 --> 5227.54]  Holy, to the King of kings.
[5227.54 --> 5242.38]  Holy, holy, holy forever.
[5242.38 --> 5244.38]  Holy, holy forever.
[5244.38 --> 5248.38]  Holy, holy forever.
[5248.38 --> 5255.22]  Holy, holy, holy forever.
[5255.22 --> 5270.06]  Holy, holy forever.
[5270.06 --> 5272.06]  Holy, holy forever.
[5272.06 --> 5276.06]  Holy, holy forever.
[5276.06 --> 5290.90]  Holy, holy forever.
[5290.90 --> 5294.90]  Holy, holy forever.
[5294.90 --> 5319.74]  Holy, holy forever.
[5319.74 --> 5321.74]  Holy, holy forever.
