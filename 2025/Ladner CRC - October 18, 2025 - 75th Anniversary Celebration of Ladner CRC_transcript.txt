[0.00 --> 9.60]  When did the zoo go so far?
[9.60 --> 16.16]  There was a thing called Abraham...
[16.16 --> 46.14]  Thank you.
[46.16 --> 76.14]  Thank you.
[76.16 --> 106.14]  Thank you.
[106.16 --> 136.14]  Thank you.
[136.16 --> 166.14]  Thank you.
[166.16 --> 196.14]  Thank you.
[196.16 --> 226.14]  Thank you.
[226.16 --> 256.14]  Thank you.
[256.16 --> 286.14]  Thank you.
[286.16 --> 316.14]  Thank you.
[316.16 --> 346.14]  Thank you.
[346.16 --> 376.14]  Thank you.
[376.14 --> 406.12]  Thank you.
[406.12 --> 436.10]  Thank you.
[436.10 --> 466.08]  Thank you.
[466.08 --> 496.06]  Thank you.
[496.08 --> 526.06]  Thank you.
[526.06 --> 556.04]  Thank you.
[556.06 --> 586.02]  Thank you.
[586.02 --> 616.00]  Thank you.
[616.00 --> 616.02] 
[646.02 --> 675.98]  Thank you.
[675.98 --> 705.96]  Thank you.
[705.98 --> 735.96]  Thank you.
[736.00 --> 765.96]  Thank you.
[765.96 --> 795.94]  Thank you.
[795.94 --> 825.94]  Thank you.
[825.94 --> 855.92]  Thank you.
[855.92 --> 885.90]  Thank you.
[885.92 --> 915.90]  Thank you.
[915.92 --> 945.90]  Thank you.
[945.90 --> 975.88]  I serve as the executive director
[975.88 --> 1005.86]  I would now, I would like to introduce, I would like to introduce, I would like to introduce
[1005.86 --> 1035.86]  Let me first, let me say,
[1035.86 --> 1065.84]  story of this story of this story.
[1065.84 --> 1095.82]  Thank you.
[1095.84 --> 1125.82]  Amen.
[1125.84 --> 1155.82]  Thank you.
[1155.84 --> 1185.82]  Thank you.
[1185.84 --> 1215.82]  Thank you.
[1215.84 --> 1217.84]  Thank you.
[1245.84 --> 1247.84]  Thank you.
[1275.84 --> 1277.84]  Thank you.
[1305.84 --> 1307.84]  Thank you.
[1307.84 --> 1309.84]  Thank you.
[1309.84 --> 1311.84]  Thank you.
[1311.84 --> 1313.84]  Thank you.
[1313.84 --> 1315.84]  Thank you.
[1315.84 --> 1316.84]  Thank you.
[1316.84 --> 1317.84]  Thank you.
[1317.84 --> 1319.84]  Thank you.
[1319.84 --> 1321.84]  Thank you.
[1321.84 --> 1323.84]  Thank you.
[1323.84 --> 1325.84]  Thank you.
[1325.84 --> 1327.84]  Thank you.
[1327.84 --> 1329.84]  Thank you.
[1329.84 --> 1331.84]  Thank you.
[1331.84 --> 1333.84]  Thank you.
[1333.84 --> 1338.14]  serving from 1954 to 1957.
[1339.30 --> 1343.98]  At that time, his Dutch language ability was important.
[1344.82 --> 1350.26]  He had immigrated to the United States as a young boy in the early 1900s.
[1351.24 --> 1356.46]  Congratulations on reaching this important milestone.
[1356.66 --> 1359.04]  Sincerely, Alan Van Dyke.
[1363.84 --> 1372.58]  In the years 1958 to 1964, a young prospective pastor,
[1373.62 --> 1379.54]  meant to follow in his father, the Reverend Cecil Tuniga's footsteps,
[1381.20 --> 1388.22]  roamed the streets here of a very rural Ladner community with his best friends,
[1389.04 --> 1390.68]  some of whom are here today.
[1390.68 --> 1397.76]  Bill Tuniga, in fact, did become a prominent CRC pastor,
[1398.62 --> 1403.28]  serving in churches in Prince George, where we first met him,
[1404.14 --> 1407.98]  New Westminster, Winnipeg, and Edmonton,
[1408.82 --> 1412.42]  and someone who has graced our pulpit many times
[1412.42 --> 1417.16]  and brought us God's word many times over many years.
[1418.28 --> 1420.92]  We now welcome Pastor Bill Tuniga,
[1421.38 --> 1425.54]  who will give us some insights into the Ladner CRC in those early years
[1425.54 --> 1427.94]  and some reflections of those times.
[1427.94 --> 1436.66]  First of all, just for the record, 75 is not old.
[1439.08 --> 1439.60]  Yeah.
[1442.40 --> 1447.32]  You know, I'm going to start off with the slides because that's,
[1448.00 --> 1451.38]  I inherited my dad's slides, as I said.
[1451.38 --> 1453.98]  He came here from 1958.
[1454.68 --> 1459.50]  I was eight at the time, and we spent six and a half years here,
[1459.86 --> 1466.18]  and they were very, very good years when I look back.
[1466.64 --> 1471.18]  And the picture that I have, I don't know if you can get the first one up.
[1471.24 --> 1472.22]  It's really, there it is.
[1472.22 --> 1475.98]  I was going to apologize for the quality,
[1476.28 --> 1479.02]  but that's not bad, from his little brownie camera.
[1479.92 --> 1483.78]  And then beside it was our parsonage.
[1484.78 --> 1486.56]  And we can go to the next one, a little.
[1487.02 --> 1488.82]  Oh, I'm sorry, no, not beside it.
[1488.90 --> 1492.10]  That's the interior of the church.
[1492.30 --> 1497.86]  My brother remarked how those wonderful homemade benches
[1497.86 --> 1499.78]  weren't always very comfortable.
[1499.78 --> 1504.20]  And then beside it was the parsonage.
[1504.90 --> 1508.44]  But that's not where we moved into when we came here.
[1508.60 --> 1514.06]  We actually ended up moving to a house on Weston Island.
[1515.68 --> 1518.86]  You can, so that's what it looks like today.
[1519.52 --> 1521.78]  That's not what it looked like back in our day.
[1522.78 --> 1523.62]  Go ahead.
[1523.80 --> 1525.16]  You can go to the next one.
[1525.50 --> 1527.66]  And there we are in front of it.
[1527.66 --> 1531.86]  And you can't make out some of these skinny little guys that are there.
[1533.68 --> 1535.58]  I think I'm in the background.
[1535.88 --> 1537.34]  No, no, I'm right in the middle in the front.
[1537.44 --> 1539.72]  You see, I had a build once.
[1539.92 --> 1540.56]  There it is.
[1542.62 --> 1546.94]  And those are my brothers and a few others,
[1548.10 --> 1550.26]  cousins that had come to visit us.
[1550.26 --> 1553.48]  You know, when we came here, my dad was 43.
[1553.68 --> 1555.18]  He was in the prime of his life.
[1555.84 --> 1558.48]  And this is our family when we arrived.
[1558.54 --> 1561.84]  I think there was a postcard that he sent out at Christmas,
[1561.98 --> 1564.18]  the first or second year that he was here.
[1564.28 --> 1567.70]  And you can see on your right, that's my brother Cal,
[1567.80 --> 1569.10]  and then Pearl, and Henry.
[1569.34 --> 1569.94]  He's here today.
[1570.12 --> 1573.14]  And Klaus, my brother Don, and then myself,
[1573.26 --> 1574.88]  way over there on the left.
[1574.88 --> 1579.16]  And Jane is on my mom's lap.
[1580.72 --> 1585.34]  You know, I view this as the church that probably my dad put the most heart
[1585.34 --> 1589.36]  and soul into of all the ones that he served.
[1589.50 --> 1591.64]  And part of that role was being in council.
[1592.46 --> 1595.16]  And he took a picture of council.
[1595.88 --> 1597.72]  And if we can have that one, there it is.
[1597.72 --> 1600.94]  I can't name all of them.
[1601.06 --> 1606.90]  I think it's Mr. Limus, and there's Mr. Bolt with his pipe in his mouth.
[1608.22 --> 1611.00]  And anyway, so they smoked.
[1611.36 --> 1613.76]  Oh, a couple times they met in our house,
[1613.92 --> 1617.86]  and mom's complaint was it took three days to clear the air out
[1617.86 --> 1619.22]  after they were done meeting.
[1621.14 --> 1626.98]  One of the great things about Ladner, as I remember them,
[1626.98 --> 1630.30]  and there were pictures already up of the church picnics.
[1630.92 --> 1633.52]  So I'd like to run, again, I inherited these.
[1633.92 --> 1635.30]  There was something for the young,
[1635.48 --> 1639.02]  and I thought that was Mickey Kloetveig at the front,
[1639.10 --> 1640.28]  but I'm not sure.
[1640.98 --> 1642.62]  They had something for the young,
[1642.92 --> 1644.88]  and then they had something for the old.
[1648.32 --> 1651.76]  They invented so many games.
[1651.90 --> 1653.00]  We couldn't believe it.
[1653.12 --> 1654.18]  Like, how in the world?
[1654.18 --> 1655.40]  You had to, yeah.
[1656.00 --> 1659.44]  And let's find out when I, there's Tony Vantal.
[1659.68 --> 1661.10]  Now, you can't tell what he's doing,
[1661.22 --> 1662.96]  but he's got a string in his hand,
[1663.56 --> 1664.60]  and he's got a key.
[1664.68 --> 1665.52]  I lost this.
[1665.60 --> 1666.80]  I know I didn't ever win it.
[1666.82 --> 1667.56]  Let's put it this way.
[1667.62 --> 1668.78]  Probably Tony won it.
[1669.90 --> 1671.28]  He's got to drive around,
[1671.44 --> 1673.56]  and while, of course, the string's getting shorter, right?
[1673.66 --> 1674.98]  And that was the game.
[1675.32 --> 1675.54]  Yeah.
[1677.42 --> 1678.06]  Go ahead.
[1678.16 --> 1679.34]  Let's see what next they did.
[1679.34 --> 1681.62]  Oh, look at this.
[1681.70 --> 1682.42]  Old folks.
[1682.56 --> 1683.42]  Mr. Terpstra.
[1683.56 --> 1684.90]  I think, is that Mr. DeVos?
[1686.00 --> 1686.44]  Yeah.
[1686.44 --> 1687.08]  Yeah, yeah.
[1687.26 --> 1688.80]  And if you look way over there,
[1689.18 --> 1691.24]  oh, I can't, my mind's not working on that.
[1691.50 --> 1693.58]  Way off to the right is myself
[1693.58 --> 1696.18]  with a little, you know, sheepish grin
[1696.18 --> 1699.84]  watching these old fellows behave like kids.
[1701.72 --> 1703.84]  Let's see what else happened at the picnic.
[1703.84 --> 1705.88]  Oh, I love this one.
[1706.64 --> 1708.52]  Gene, do you see yourself there?
[1708.68 --> 1709.80]  Third from the left?
[1710.46 --> 1710.76]  Yeah.
[1711.60 --> 1713.26]  I know teenagers these days
[1713.26 --> 1714.90]  don't dress the way they used to,
[1714.98 --> 1718.04]  but this was the sack race that they always had.
[1718.70 --> 1722.24]  And then, don't ask me what that competition was about,
[1722.38 --> 1724.10]  but there was something in the pan,
[1724.48 --> 1727.84]  and you had to run fast and then get back, of course.
[1728.96 --> 1729.86]  We'll just carry on.
[1730.14 --> 1732.76]  Oh, yeah, I did participate in this.
[1732.76 --> 1734.48]  I thought that was Sid Viss.
[1734.54 --> 1735.72]  He thinks it's his brother,
[1735.90 --> 1737.18]  but it's one of the Viss boys,
[1737.96 --> 1741.48]  and you had to run off, get fully dressed,
[1741.60 --> 1745.16]  and then run back with whatever they gave you to put on.
[1746.14 --> 1746.92]  Carry on.
[1747.30 --> 1748.04]  Oh, and there's another.
[1748.16 --> 1750.12]  Mr. Viss and his son, and again,
[1750.26 --> 1751.36]  I'm not sure which one,
[1751.42 --> 1752.80]  and Mr. Bolt in the background.
[1753.52 --> 1755.12]  Everybody had a great time.
[1756.38 --> 1757.50]  Oh, the boys.
[1757.50 --> 1763.08]  Yeah, the young peoples were something else.
[1763.72 --> 1764.14]  I know.
[1764.70 --> 1767.00]  Oh, go back one more if you can.
[1767.24 --> 1769.22]  My brother Kloss is third from the right.
[1769.22 --> 1770.84]  I don't know what he's got in his mouth,
[1771.24 --> 1773.86]  and there's a few of the Cornelius boys in there,
[1774.40 --> 1775.64]  but they had a good time.
[1775.98 --> 1776.56]  Carry on.
[1777.34 --> 1777.84]  What was that?
[1778.26 --> 1780.06]  Oh, somebody's got to show off.
[1780.88 --> 1782.80]  They had these various things.
[1783.48 --> 1784.48]  Was that a gitama?
[1784.78 --> 1786.18]  I think it might have been.
[1787.42 --> 1787.82]  Anyways.
[1788.62 --> 1790.92]  Oh, I saw one of these over there, too.
[1791.38 --> 1794.58]  So it's the best quality I could get out of it,
[1794.62 --> 1795.62]  and we can carry on.
[1795.68 --> 1797.20]  There's a few more little pictures here.
[1797.24 --> 1798.30]  Oh, there's Mr. Bolt.
[1798.82 --> 1804.06]  Like I say, the old folks were behaving like little kids.
[1804.14 --> 1806.30]  They were having a ride at these picnics.
[1806.74 --> 1808.04]  In Peace Arts Park.
[1808.56 --> 1811.22]  Oh, and if they were young babies, there they are,
[1811.22 --> 1817.38]  and there's my mom, second from the left, observing.
[1818.10 --> 1820.62]  And it wasn't one of hers, obviously, or theirs.
[1820.76 --> 1822.58]  Somebody else had brought the kids along.
[1823.40 --> 1825.16]  Oh, the choir.
[1826.32 --> 1828.46]  Mr. Vantal and all the gals.
[1828.54 --> 1830.52]  There's guys in the back, and Henry was,
[1830.62 --> 1832.78]  my brother Henry was there because he was in love
[1832.78 --> 1834.54]  with one of the girls in the choir.
[1834.54 --> 1839.34]  And, you know, they couldn't sing in church.
[1840.70 --> 1841.48]  No, no, no.
[1841.60 --> 1844.54]  Church was not for that kind of performance stuff.
[1844.94 --> 1848.84]  So they would do their thing at picnics like this.
[1849.44 --> 1851.78]  Oh, and there in the middle, I think that's Mr. Vantal.
[1852.02 --> 1855.42]  But they always got folks out, and there's one more of this.
[1855.42 --> 1858.14]  Yeah, and there's the heavyweight there.
[1858.92 --> 1860.06]  That's my father.
[1861.68 --> 1862.04]  Yes.
[1862.78 --> 1866.82]  Yes, he could put, oh, it was fun watching these things.
[1867.74 --> 1868.62]  Carry on.
[1868.70 --> 1870.14]  Otherwise, it's got, see that?
[1870.28 --> 1871.94]  If you think people didn't have fun.
[1872.90 --> 1877.24]  I think that's Mrs. Pierce, and I don't know who the other person is.
[1877.24 --> 1907.22]  Mrs. Pierce, and I don't know who the other person is.
[1907.24 --> 1910.34]  Anyways, that's, that's, I could have showed you a bunch more,
[1910.52 --> 1913.96]  but it gives you a sample.
[1914.28 --> 1918.24]  You know, I have, as I said, great memories.
[1919.04 --> 1925.30]  I remember Mr. Vantal playing the organ with feeling,
[1925.74 --> 1929.98]  and then my sister Pearl got into it, and she played the organ fast.
[1930.90 --> 1935.42]  And she would end the song two, three notes before the rest of us.
[1935.42 --> 1939.16]  And my dad did have a few words with her, as I remember.
[1939.98 --> 1943.40]  And then Mr. Van Zanten, he was the principal of the school,
[1943.48 --> 1944.60]  but boy, could he play.
[1944.74 --> 1950.02]  And I remember Christmas, I think twice, we had a pump organ,
[1950.44 --> 1952.10]  and it was in the, he put it down in the middle.
[1952.76 --> 1957.70]  He was pumping, and he played the Handel's, you know,
[1957.78 --> 1960.18]  Hallelujah course, pumping that organ.
[1960.18 --> 1963.80]  He was sweating like crazy when the song was done.
[1964.24 --> 1965.32]  But it was beautiful.
[1965.48 --> 1967.32]  I was just mesmerized.
[1968.32 --> 1970.90]  You know, my father also sweated a fair amount.
[1971.02 --> 1975.02]  He worked very hard in this church, I can say that,
[1975.08 --> 1979.10]  not only doing council meetings, preaching twice a Sunday,
[1979.38 --> 1981.80]  and actually brushing up on his Dutch,
[1982.00 --> 1985.22]  because he was a Frisian, and he had to learn a little bit more Dutch
[1985.22 --> 1988.06]  to preach in it, it wasn't always easy.
[1989.02 --> 1993.80]  On top of that, he writes in his memoirs that at one point,
[1994.94 --> 1998.36]  he, on top of all the local responsibilities,
[1999.20 --> 2002.34]  he became stated clerk, a church visitor,
[2002.94 --> 2007.48]  member of the Board of Foreign Missions, as it was called back then,
[2007.48 --> 2010.18]  was a member of the Student Fund Committee,
[2010.18 --> 2015.80]  chair of the Association of Reformed Scientific Studies.
[2015.98 --> 2019.22]  That's the ICS, the Institute for Christian Studies.
[2020.00 --> 2022.94]  He probably was part of it then because it was reformed,
[2022.96 --> 2024.66]  or he would say still reformed.
[2024.72 --> 2029.50]  Anyways, he was a church counselor to Langley at this time,
[2030.40 --> 2033.86]  and taught a profession of faith class,
[2033.86 --> 2040.28]  and on top of that, taught a class on modern faiths in Vancouver.
[2042.52 --> 2045.42]  And as he notes, and I'll use my language,
[2046.30 --> 2049.32]  when you run fast, you get the runs.
[2049.78 --> 2052.10]  And that's literally what happened.
[2052.24 --> 2057.20]  He got sick, and his body and his doctor told him to slow down.
[2058.10 --> 2059.96]  And, you know, I think that had something to do
[2059.96 --> 2062.06]  with why he took the call to Telco.
[2062.06 --> 2063.22]  He wasn't planning to.
[2064.16 --> 2067.78]  Some men pulled him aside and told him about the needs,
[2068.44 --> 2073.12]  and being someone who is always ready to, he needs a challenge,
[2073.64 --> 2076.24]  he decided to go to Telco.
[2076.32 --> 2079.88]  I didn't like it, but hey, over there, the work was less,
[2080.56 --> 2083.08]  and the fishing was just as good,
[2083.46 --> 2085.82]  and it was right out the back door.
[2087.40 --> 2089.78]  You know, more than a few people have remarked to me
[2089.78 --> 2091.82]  that my father was a conservative.
[2092.34 --> 2094.30]  But, you know, that's not a really good look at it.
[2095.24 --> 2095.86]  He'd say, no.
[2096.76 --> 2100.24]  I was just here to preach the scriptures.
[2100.90 --> 2102.26]  Yes, I was reformed.
[2103.32 --> 2105.68]  But I wanted to explain the scriptures
[2105.68 --> 2110.10]  for exactly what they say,
[2110.88 --> 2113.66]  whether you like to hear it or not.
[2113.66 --> 2121.40]  And so I believe that when he looks back,
[2121.48 --> 2123.00]  when we look back, we can say,
[2123.12 --> 2125.08]  there was a man who made his mistakes,
[2126.08 --> 2127.76]  but he gave heart and soul.
[2128.92 --> 2130.28]  So many good memories.
[2130.52 --> 2133.68]  I could, I was going to list a few of my own,
[2133.74 --> 2135.06]  but I decided not to.
[2135.54 --> 2136.76]  But I will end with this.
[2136.84 --> 2137.52]  There are two things.
[2137.52 --> 2139.58]  First, it's here where my brother Henry
[2139.58 --> 2141.84]  fell in love with Jean Van Tall,
[2142.48 --> 2143.88]  and they're here today.
[2144.16 --> 2149.72]  And my sister Pearl found Homer Samplonius,
[2149.82 --> 2151.10]  or some of you may remember,
[2151.22 --> 2152.52]  Reverend Homer Samplonius.
[2153.44 --> 2154.72]  They're in Ontario today.
[2155.96 --> 2157.12]  I may conclude with this.
[2157.24 --> 2161.18]  God's word speaks about the church being a mother.
[2161.18 --> 2167.64]  And this church served in my life,
[2167.70 --> 2169.60]  as has been really noted already,
[2170.40 --> 2173.66]  something like a spiritual mother.
[2174.34 --> 2177.26]  It really was here for me,
[2177.40 --> 2179.92]  grades three to halfway through nine, ten,
[2180.72 --> 2182.26]  that I was nurtured,
[2182.44 --> 2184.96]  and where I truly experienced
[2184.96 --> 2189.84]  that we're part of a family that's eternal.
[2191.18 --> 2194.96]  And what God started in me here,
[2195.26 --> 2197.46]  and in many of you,
[2197.90 --> 2199.58]  will one day be completed
[2199.58 --> 2201.84]  when Christ returns
[2201.84 --> 2204.52]  and makes all things new.
[2205.24 --> 2205.88]  Thank you.
[2205.88 --> 2205.92]  Thank you.
[2206.92 --> 2207.88]  applause
[2207.88 --> 2221.56]  And

[2363.14 --> 2363.98]  joy
[2363.98 --> 2389.08]  It was so awesome to see all those pictures of all those church picnics.
[2389.08 --> 2393.62]  It sure brought back a lot of great memories, and thank you so much for sharing that with us.
[2393.98 --> 2403.18]  So, in early 1951, the first members of Ladner CRC Church formed the Christian School Society.
[2403.18 --> 2409.20]  Minutes from those years in Dutch, from consistory and congregational meetings, indicate the origin
[2409.20 --> 2411.38]  of this society.
[2411.38 --> 2416.94]  Dues to the society began to be collected, all culminating in the start of Ladner Christian
[2416.94 --> 2424.18]  School in the fall of 1954, out of the newly constructed Ladner CRC Church building on
[2424.18 --> 2425.14]  Ladner Trunk Road.
[2425.14 --> 2431.00]  And I'm sure if I asked everyone here who attended Ladner Christian School or Delta Christian
[2431.00 --> 2435.10]  School now, put up your hands if you attended Ladner Christian School.
[2435.10 --> 2439.10]  So we have a strong history there, and there's others who have taught there over the years,
[2439.10 --> 2440.10]  so wonderful to see.
[2440.10 --> 2447.16]  Today, 71 years later, Delta Christian School remains a testament of God's faithfulness and
[2447.16 --> 2449.30]  people's commitment of so long ago.
[2449.30 --> 2455.70]  So, I'd now like to invite Brian Young, who's the current principal of Delta Christian School,
[2455.70 --> 2462.70]  to come up and share with us.
[2462.70 --> 2468.80]  Brian Young, I always have to lower the mic because I haven't been blessed with the Dutch
[2468.80 --> 2472.02]  height, as many of you have.
[2472.02 --> 2474.76]  But it's such a wonderful privilege to be with you here today.
[2474.76 --> 2480.62]  I want to thank this community for your warm welcome to me as a young principal 10 years
[2480.62 --> 2482.90]  ago now.
[2482.90 --> 2492.18]  And yeah, so I do want to first acknowledge some of the former administrators who are also
[2492.18 --> 2494.34]  here today.
[2494.34 --> 2497.72]  Principal Jake Lewin and Gerda are here as well.
[2497.72 --> 2499.72]  Jake.
[2499.72 --> 2507.52]  Amongst others, and my apologies if I miss any names here, but Mr. Roger Gross, who was on
[2507.52 --> 2508.52]  the Oregon.
[2508.52 --> 2516.72]  We have some former staff, Joan Van Toll, of course, and also Mrs. Banstra, as well as
[2516.72 --> 2517.72]  many.
[2517.72 --> 2520.38]  Winnie has also been part of our community.
[2520.38 --> 2524.84]  And so, on behalf of all of us, I'm here today.
[2524.84 --> 2532.80]  Today we gather to celebrate a remarkable milestone, 75 years of Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[2532.80 --> 2539.76]  Last year, the school celebrated our 70th anniversary since the start of Ladner Christian School,
[2539.76 --> 2542.72]  today known as Delta Christian School.
[2542.72 --> 2545.60]  Our histories are intertwined.
[2545.60 --> 2552.38]  Without Ladner Christian Reformed Church, there would be no Delta Christian School.
[2552.38 --> 2557.48]  It is through the vision and commitment of the founding families to establish a deep connection
[2557.48 --> 2565.58]  between church, home, and school that this ministry has endured through the decades.
[2565.58 --> 2571.78]  Over these seven decades, we've witnessed God's incredible faithfulness at work in this school.
[2571.78 --> 2576.88]  What began as a small community of believers with a vision for Christian education has grown
[2576.88 --> 2583.66]  into generation after generation of families growing and serving together.
[2583.66 --> 2589.70]  Through this time, many families have returned with their children and even their grandchildren.
[2589.70 --> 2595.34]  It is a beautiful picture of God's ongoing work, knitting together faith and learning across
[2595.34 --> 2596.84]  generations.
[2596.84 --> 2603.66]  Today, Delta Christian School is home to 301.5 students.
[2603.66 --> 2616.56]  200 families and more than 45 dedicated staff members.
[2616.56 --> 2622.58]  And by next year, that number is expected to grow to over 330 students, where we will be
[2622.58 --> 2629.66]  at full capacity pre-kindergarten to grade 7.
[2629.66 --> 2635.76]  Each one has been brought here by God's hand to this particular place in this particular
[2635.76 --> 2636.76]  time.
[2636.76 --> 2640.90]  Together, we are part of a continuing story that began decades ago.
[2640.90 --> 2646.12]  A story of faith, learning, and community rooted in God's purpose.
[2646.12 --> 2653.72]  What began with the faith the size of a mustard seed in a one classroom with 15 students on
[2653.72 --> 2661.28]  Ladner Trunk Road has grown to over 20 classrooms with a recent expansion.
[2661.28 --> 2663.28]  Seeds are being planted daily.
[2663.28 --> 2669.24]  And while we may not always see the fruit that grows from them, we trust that the good work
[2669.24 --> 2675.84]  God began here continues to bear fruit in ways beyond what we can imagine.
[2675.84 --> 2680.76]  One of the greatest joys is when former students come back to visit.
[2680.76 --> 2683.14]  There are many of you here today.
[2683.14 --> 2688.06]  And they'll say things like, I remember the pink walls.
[2688.06 --> 2692.38]  Or they'll start singing the dolphin song.
[2692.38 --> 2696.52]  But what they always talk about without fail are the people.
[2696.52 --> 2701.32]  The teachers, the mentors, those who shaped their lives, and the friendships they formed
[2701.32 --> 2702.32]  along the way.
[2702.32 --> 2707.50]  They'll ask, is Mrs. Banstra still teaching here?
[2707.50 --> 2710.86]  She's never truly going to leave.
[2710.86 --> 2716.26]  Or say, I remember when Mr. Lewin would always...
[2716.26 --> 2721.24]  And you know, those memories remind us that what truly endures isn't just the building or
[2721.24 --> 2722.58]  the programs.
[2722.58 --> 2728.70]  It's the relationships, the care, and the love that reflect Christ to each generation.
[2728.70 --> 2735.82]  Our students today will one day return 20 or 30 years from now with stories and children
[2735.82 --> 2737.58]  of their own.
[2737.58 --> 2744.52]  Even if only one heart has turned to Jesus at 4789 53rd Street, every effort over these
[2744.52 --> 2748.96]  75 years would have been worth it.
[2748.96 --> 2751.88]  But we know it has been much more than one.
[2751.88 --> 2758.24]  It has been thousands of lives shaped by the love of Christ through this community.
[2758.24 --> 2763.00]  Each day our students are encountering Jesus through the love of their teachers, through
[2763.00 --> 2768.16]  the friendships they form, and through the care of the community that surrounds them.
[2768.16 --> 2774.50]  In every lesson, in every prayer, in every chapel service, every act of kindness, the presence
[2774.50 --> 2778.24]  of Christ continues to shape hearts and minds.
[2778.24 --> 2785.06]  It was 40 years ago that my own immigrant parents made the decision to enroll me in a Christian
[2785.06 --> 2790.90]  school in the lower mainland here, just across on the other side of the Fraser.
[2790.90 --> 2797.36]  It was there that my mind and my heart were captivated by the story that we all belong to.
[2797.36 --> 2801.88]  The story that reminds us that our world belongs to God.
[2801.88 --> 2807.82]  Those early years helped me see the wonder of God's creation and the sovereignty of God,
[2807.82 --> 2809.76]  truths captured so beautifully.
[2809.76 --> 2814.86]  In this song we used to sing at our weekly assemblies.
[2814.86 --> 2817.18]  All things bright and beautiful.
[2817.18 --> 2819.24]  All creatures great and small.
[2819.24 --> 2821.50]  All things wise and wonderful.
[2821.50 --> 2824.44]  The Lord God has made them all.
[2824.44 --> 2830.80]  This recognition of God as a creator holding all things in his hand continues to resonate
[2830.80 --> 2836.26]  through the halls of Delta Christian School, shaping how we teach, how we learn, and how
[2836.26 --> 2838.64]  we live together in community.
[2838.64 --> 2845.18]  As we look at the world today, we are even more compelled to direct our children to all
[2845.18 --> 2848.68]  that is beautiful and to their maker.
[2848.68 --> 2854.00]  In a world that often distorts truth and beauty, we remain committed to helping them see the
[2854.00 --> 2861.14]  fingerprints of God in all things and to live as people who reflect his light.
[2861.14 --> 2867.98]  The road has not always been easy for the school, nor without trouble or doubt.
[2867.98 --> 2873.50]  But through it all, we see God's faithfulness to his people here in Ladner.
[2873.50 --> 2879.68]  I hear stories of groups of parents who were just committed to keep on praying.
[2879.68 --> 2881.78]  Let's keep on trusting.
[2881.78 --> 2888.32]  And God, through his provision, his protection, and his promise have carried the community through
[2888.32 --> 2890.50]  every challenge.
[2890.50 --> 2894.00]  And so we ask, what does a future hold?
[2894.00 --> 2898.84]  We don't know for certain, but our eyes are on him.
[2898.84 --> 2905.02]  This year, we reestablished our middle school program, expanding opportunities for leadership,
[2905.02 --> 2910.08]  discipleship, and deeper learning for our grades five to seven students.
[2910.08 --> 2915.94]  Next year, we will be reestablishing our junior kindergarten program for four-year-olds.
[2915.94 --> 2919.78]  Some of you might remember little dolphins.
[2919.78 --> 2926.98]  Another way to welcome young learners into Christ-centered community from the very beginning of their journey.
[2926.98 --> 2933.56]  We see the churches in the community as partners in this journey together in seeing his kingdom
[2933.56 --> 2936.04]  come here in Ladner.
[2936.04 --> 2941.28]  Our board of directors, made up of parents just like you over the years, will also be
[2941.28 --> 2945.82]  asking important questions about what comes next.
[2945.82 --> 2951.42]  One of which is, where do our students go after grade seven?
[2951.42 --> 2956.28]  There is a growing thirst and demand for Christian education in our region.
[2956.28 --> 2963.48]  As more families move into South Delta, as the tunnel is built eventually, and as families
[2963.48 --> 2970.22]  look for faith-based educational options, we can't help but wonder, could we one day see
[2970.22 --> 2978.36]  a preschool to grade 12 Christian school established right here in South Delta?
[2978.36 --> 2983.24]  My prayer is that God will continue to stir our imagination and expand our vision as we
[2983.24 --> 2988.98]  know that he will provide in his time to see his kingdom come here in Ladner, and to give
[2988.98 --> 2995.92]  us a faith and courage to do big things for him once again, just as our founders did 70
[2995.92 --> 2997.56]  years ago.
[2997.56 --> 3002.66]  For we know the plans he has for us, plans to prosper us, to give us hope and a future in
[3002.66 --> 3005.16]  the next 70 years and beyond.
[3005.16 --> 3007.66]  The school is in good hands.
[3007.66 --> 3009.42]  It's in God's hands.
[3009.42 --> 3013.62]  The work that began 70 years ago continues today.
[3013.62 --> 3019.14]  This is a legacy of Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[3019.14 --> 3022.80]  To that we simply say, thank you.
[3022.80 --> 3030.44]  Thank you for opening your hearts and your community to all of God's people here in Ladner and beyond.
[3030.44 --> 3038.68]  As we look back at the past 75 years and what he is doing here today, I go back to the song
[3038.68 --> 3040.40]  that I mentioned earlier.
[3040.40 --> 3046.50]  And the verse 4 says, he gave us eyes to see them and lips that we might tell, how great
[3046.50 --> 3052.72]  is God Almighty, who has made all things well.
[3052.72 --> 3054.96]  Thank you for having us here today.
[3054.96 --> 3061.70]  And we look forward to our continued partnership between the church, the home, and the school.
[3061.70 --> 3065.08]  And blessings to all of you in the years to come.
[3065.08 --> 3067.08]  Thank you.
[3067.08 --> 3076.96]  Thank you, Brian.
[3076.96 --> 3083.08]  The Bolt family, a long-standing family from the early days at Ladner CRC.
[3083.08 --> 3088.12]  And one of the sons, John Bolt, grew up in Ladner and was educated and went to school at
[3088.12 --> 3090.10]  Ladner Christian School.
[3090.10 --> 3095.46]  He's a well-known former pastor and now retired Calvin Seminary Professor.
[3095.46 --> 3100.44]  For the past two years, he has been researching and writing about the history of CRC churches
[3100.44 --> 3103.98]  in the Lower Mainland and specifically Ladner.
[3103.98 --> 3110.06]  He studied the strong correlation between the CRC church formations and the direct association
[3110.06 --> 3115.10]  to the start-up of Christian schools in the Lower Mainland and Canada.
[3115.10 --> 3119.90]  He will be publishing a paper and likely a book related to his research, which he will share,
[3119.90 --> 3122.12]  I'm sure, in due course.
[3122.12 --> 3125.88]  Dr. Bolt was unfortunately not able to be here today because of some health issues.
[3125.88 --> 3130.74]  However, he did send a letter, which I will now read to you.
[3130.74 --> 3135.86]  As a son of the congregation, I am happy to add my congratulations to the Ladner Christian
[3135.86 --> 3138.64]  Reformed Church on its 75th anniversary.
[3138.64 --> 3141.10]  75 years is a long time.
[3141.10 --> 3142.36]  I should know.
[3142.36 --> 3144.36]  I was there at the beginning.
[3144.36 --> 3145.56]  Almost.
[3145.56 --> 3152.60]  The Bolt family arrived in Ladner in February 1951, four months after the church was organized.
[3152.60 --> 3157.32]  I grew up in the Ladner CRC during the first decade of its existence and want to share a
[3157.32 --> 3164.18]  few reflections on the spiritual nature and soul formation I received, which shaped my life
[3164.18 --> 3166.38]  of Christian discipleship.
[3166.38 --> 3171.34]  Our souls are formed by modeling or example, by teaching and by service.
[3171.34 --> 3177.82]  What stands out for me in the Ladner CRC of those days was commitment and sacrifice.
[3177.82 --> 3182.94]  The congregation of immigrants, in less than two years after organization, had built a
[3182.94 --> 3188.98]  new church building on property that had in view the possibility of classrooms for a Christian
[3188.98 --> 3190.40]  day school.
[3190.40 --> 3195.42]  To this known fact, however, something else must be added that is probably not as well
[3195.42 --> 3198.46]  known.
[3198.46 --> 3204.84]  In February 1952, when the church new building was ready, most of the members did not yet
[3204.84 --> 3207.56]  even own their own home.
[3207.56 --> 3212.36]  When the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem, the prophet Haggai admonished them for living
[3212.36 --> 3216.80]  in fancy cedar-paneled homes while God's house laid in ruins.
[3216.80 --> 3222.30]  By contrast, the Ladner immigrant community lived the instruction of Jesus, seek first the
[3222.30 --> 3227.82]  kingdom of God, a lesson deeply imprinted on me as a child.
[3227.82 --> 3230.54]  Deep piety was also modeled for me.
[3230.54 --> 3235.78]  Here I want to single out two activities, prayer in the Dutch language and singing in either
[3235.78 --> 3237.68]  Dutch or English.
[3237.68 --> 3242.02]  Whether it was my grandfather's evening prayers that I overheard when I stayed overnight at their
[3242.02 --> 3247.86]  farm or the prayers of elders in worship at congregational meetings or family visits
[3247.86 --> 3253.20]  when the elders of our church prayed in their native language, the reality of their heartfelt
[3253.20 --> 3259.66]  faith and love was very obvious and left a profound impression on my young soul.
[3259.66 --> 3265.46]  The Ladner C of my youth was a great singing congregation, even developing a reputation in
[3265.46 --> 3268.74]  the Ladner community for its robust singing.
[3268.74 --> 3274.54]  The All Saints Anglican Church is a few blocks from the location of that old Ladner CRC Church
[3274.54 --> 3277.30]  on the corner of Trunk Road and 53rd.
[3277.30 --> 3282.80]  I recall its rector, Reverend Ruse, commenting that in the summer when it was warm and all
[3282.80 --> 3288.02]  the windows in the church were open for our 2 p.m. service, he could hear our singing from
[3288.02 --> 3289.60]  that distance.
[3289.60 --> 3294.82]  In the Ladner CRC, meaningful prayer was modeled for me and I became a lifelong lover of good
[3294.82 --> 3296.98]  congregational singing.
[3296.98 --> 3299.38]  Soul formation also requires teaching.
[3299.38 --> 3303.98]  We were taught the Bible in Sunday school and Christian school, but we also were catechized.
[3303.98 --> 3306.98]  I don't think I've ever said that word before.
[3306.98 --> 3313.48]  I mention catechism because this instruction tied us to the Church of Christ beyond our
[3313.48 --> 3315.26]  own congregation.
[3315.26 --> 3321.00]  To the past Church of the Reformation and to the present continent-wide Christian reformed
[3321.00 --> 3322.38]  denomination.
[3322.38 --> 3326.98]  It is a temptation for small immigrant communities to be narrowly focused on themselves.
[3326.98 --> 3329.70]  The catechism was one way our vision was broadened.
[3329.70 --> 3332.20]  Christian discipleship must be practiced.
[3332.20 --> 3336.20]  It must be a matter of heart, our head and our hands.
[3336.20 --> 3339.98]  In the church in which I grew up, young people were expected to serve.
[3339.98 --> 3344.20]  We canvassed our neighborhood for the daily vacation Bible school in the summer.
[3344.20 --> 3349.70]  We included, we were included in the free labor work crews that built the new classrooms for
[3349.70 --> 3353.62]  the Christian school, participated in fundraising and so forth.
[3353.62 --> 3358.48]  And this service was not only inside the church community, but directed outward as well.
[3358.48 --> 3363.70]  The Ladner CRC developed a reputation for being good blood donors.
[3363.70 --> 3369.30]  Shortly after my 18th birthday, when I entered the lower level of the Ladner United Church and
[3369.30 --> 3375.08]  looked around, I could have sworn I was at a congregational meeting.
[3375.08 --> 3380.70]  In addition, members of the Ladner CRC became prominent members of the Ladner Volunteer Fire
[3380.70 --> 3382.12]  Department.
[3382.12 --> 3383.12]  That is my story.
[3383.12 --> 3384.12]  Others may have a different one.
[3384.12 --> 3389.12]  I can only bear witness that the spiritual nurture I received in the Ladner CRC prepared
[3389.12 --> 3395.80]  me well for my Christian vocation and I am profoundly grateful for it.
[3395.80 --> 3403.92]  My prayer for the Ladner CRC is that 25, 50 or 75 years from now, if our Lord has not returned,
[3403.92 --> 3409.22]  today's children and youth will be able to give similar testimonies if asked to do so at
[3409.22 --> 3410.96]  some future anniversary.
[3410.96 --> 3438.14]  May our Lord continue to bless you richly.
[3438.14 --> 3447.40]  I stay as mefeed your heart.
[3447.40 --> 3451.18]  I stay as me now to pass,
[3451.52 --> 3457.20]  as a blessing on day and day.
[3457.54 --> 3462.62]  I stay as me Bayvin'
[3463.16 --> 3465.60]  my heart, boy,
[3466.18 --> 3467.44]  in cave.
[3467.44 --> 3474.88]  The prize for our eternalitted faith,
[3475.84 --> 3478.66]  holy Terry.
[3478.66 --> 3486.38]  On the show reigns it is a His Holy Testament.
[3487.46 --> 3488.46] LEOD.
[3488.46 --> 3490.46]  Amen.
[3518.46 --> 3544.10]  Just in case any of you have noticed,
[3544.10 --> 3549.28]  one of those pictures there of our church,
[3549.80 --> 3553.08]  this church built in 1971,
[3554.42 --> 3555.80]  shows a steeple there.
[3557.08 --> 3560.62]  And the answer is no, no more steeple.
[3561.54 --> 3566.48]  Some things do get so old that they have to be removed
[3566.48 --> 3569.00]  and sometimes even replaced.
[3569.84 --> 3572.06]  That's still something pending, okay?
[3574.10 --> 3579.64]  Ladner Christian Reformed Church was privileged to support
[3579.64 --> 3583.16]  Gary and Jennifer Rosema and OMF
[3583.16 --> 3586.82]  for years in the missionary work,
[3587.40 --> 3589.48]  their missionary work in Papua New Guinea
[3589.48 --> 3592.24]  and later in Malaysia.
[3593.70 --> 3597.20]  Gary also spent a year here at Ladner CRC
[3597.20 --> 3598.42]  as an associate pastor
[3598.42 --> 3601.30]  during a time of vacancy
[3601.30 --> 3605.10]  and at that time and since
[3605.10 --> 3608.76]  has preached and graced his pulpit many times.
[3609.80 --> 3613.54]  He continues to be a driving force with Seafarers Ministry,
[3614.60 --> 3618.20]  operating in the parts of Vancouver and here in Delta.
[3618.20 --> 3623.96]  Gary is busy always with Seafarers work
[3623.96 --> 3628.48]  and that goes around most of Canada.
[3629.82 --> 3632.52]  Today, he is in a neighboring province
[3632.52 --> 3635.16]  doing Seafarers Ministry work
[3635.16 --> 3641.72]  and so today, we are privileged to have at least a video comment
[3641.72 --> 3643.00]  from Gary and Jennifer.
[3643.66 --> 3646.66]  I think this was actually done just a couple of weeks ago
[3646.66 --> 3650.58]  while they were back in Malaysia
[3650.58 --> 3653.52]  and so we'll watch that video.
[3654.12 --> 3655.08]  Welcome now.
[3656.04 --> 3658.94]  Hello, friends from Ladner CRC
[3658.94 --> 3662.84]  and congratulations on your anniversary.
[3663.28 --> 3664.02]  What number is it?
[3664.04 --> 3664.90]  Number 75.
[3665.32 --> 3665.64]  Wow.
[3665.88 --> 3668.42]  We're so sorry we couldn't be there for this
[3668.42 --> 3670.36]  but we're both out of town on the weekend.
[3670.36 --> 3673.22]  But we wanted to wish you well
[3673.22 --> 3675.46]  and God's blessings, continued blessings.
[3676.04 --> 3678.86]  And we have such fond memories of Ladner.
[3678.98 --> 3681.50]  Like when we first arrived,
[3681.64 --> 3684.72]  I was expecting our Tim, who's our middle son
[3684.72 --> 3687.22]  and just some news for you
[3687.22 --> 3689.56]  that our Tim and his Erica
[3689.56 --> 3692.80]  are also now expecting their first child.
[3693.00 --> 3694.52]  So there's a generation.
[3695.24 --> 3696.54]  And our first grandchild.
[3696.58 --> 3697.68]  And our first grandchild
[3697.68 --> 3701.48]  and thank you for just your love and friendship
[3701.48 --> 3702.30]  over the years.
[3702.54 --> 3703.70]  And we hope to see you soon.
[3703.98 --> 3704.54]  Yeah, thanks.
[3704.58 --> 3705.90]  It's been great to be part of the fellowship
[3705.90 --> 3708.84]  and we continue to have a very special,
[3708.98 --> 3710.80]  you have a very special place in our hearts.
[3710.94 --> 3711.72]  So thank you very much.
[3711.80 --> 3712.24]  God bless.
[3712.58 --> 3712.74]  Yeah.
[3712.94 --> 3713.30]  Bye-bye.
[3713.92 --> 3714.32]  Blessings.
[3714.32 --> 3728.96]  The story will come in a minute.
[3728.96 --> 3736.48]  In the mid-1990,
[3737.60 --> 3738.50]  a young candidate,
[3739.64 --> 3741.60]  his wife and five children,
[3742.72 --> 3745.54]  arrived at the church parsonage here in Ladner
[3745.54 --> 3748.42]  after a long, long drive
[3748.42 --> 3751.76]  from Michigan and Calvin College.
[3751.76 --> 3755.08]  Jim and Joan Berry and family
[3755.08 --> 3758.94]  were happy to be able to move into their new home
[3758.94 --> 3763.12]  and also become an integral part of this community,
[3763.34 --> 3764.26]  Ladner CRC.
[3765.24 --> 3767.24]  This was an exciting ministry
[3767.24 --> 3770.04]  and start in God's Vineyard in Ladner.
[3771.40 --> 3773.72]  One of the comments that we heard later
[3773.72 --> 3776.32]  about that time of their arrival was,
[3776.32 --> 3781.74]  Oh, at last I can have at least a decent shower.
[3784.66 --> 3788.50]  Jim and Joan ministered here at Ladner CRC
[3788.50 --> 3790.18]  for over eight years
[3790.18 --> 3792.88]  before being called to start
[3792.88 --> 3796.82]  a new West Coast Community Church here in Delta.
[3798.76 --> 3800.98]  Jim retired several years ago
[3800.98 --> 3805.08]  and he and Joan have recently taken up residence
[3805.08 --> 3807.06]  on Vancouver Island.
[3809.04 --> 3812.00]  Now, what's this all about?
[3813.42 --> 3818.82]  From the time that I first started speaking with Jim
[3818.82 --> 3820.80]  and later Joan,
[3821.76 --> 3823.90]  this was in the calling process,
[3825.36 --> 3827.38]  it became well known to me
[3827.38 --> 3834.04]  that he was an ardent Toronto Maple Leaf fan.
[3834.04 --> 3840.62]  And he often preached that word,
[3840.72 --> 3841.54]  not from here,
[3842.28 --> 3846.80]  but preached that Toronto Maple Leaf fan business.
[3846.80 --> 3851.96]  And he was assured absolutely
[3851.96 --> 3854.14]  that soon,
[3854.14 --> 3855.22]  and remember,
[3855.56 --> 3858.38]  the last Stanley Cup was 1967
[3858.38 --> 3860.44]  for the Maple Leaf fans out there,
[3861.44 --> 3864.50]  that soon the Toronto Maple Leafs
[3864.50 --> 3867.60]  would have another Stanley Cup.
[3867.60 --> 3872.18]  I obviously don't have persuasive powers.
[3872.18 --> 3874.18]  I tried hard,
[3874.18 --> 3876.90]  and I'm trying hard again.
[3877.90 --> 3878.16]  Jim,
[3878.16 --> 3879.68]  it's really,
[3879.92 --> 3882.34]  really time that you switch
[3882.34 --> 3885.12]  and cheer these guys on
[3885.12 --> 3887.44]  to their first Stanley Cup.
[3887.44 --> 3890.42]  We want to welcome at this time
[3890.42 --> 3891.58]  Pastor Jim Berry
[3891.58 --> 3895.06]  to share his reflections on Ladner CRC
[3895.06 --> 3898.18]  during a significant time of change
[3898.18 --> 3901.36]  and a significant era,
[3902.36 --> 3905.74]  the second era of the 75 years.
[3905.98 --> 3906.52]  Please, Jim.
[3906.52 --> 3920.18]  Thank you.
[3932.22 --> 3933.10]  औừngाईन killer खही –
[3933.10 --> 3936.44] —
[3936.52 --> 3949.70]  He's done a good job of evangelizing my family because they're now all Canuck fans.
[3956.42 --> 3959.36]  Before I start, where's Bill Tuniga?
[3961.38 --> 3963.26]  It's so nice to see you again.
[3963.88 --> 3966.50]  We were colleagues here when you were at New West Church.
[3966.98 --> 3967.86]  And I was in Ladner.
[3968.64 --> 3970.12]  You planted a church in New West.
[3970.46 --> 3971.88]  I tried to plant a church here.
[3972.72 --> 3974.70]  We had lots of walks together.
[3974.84 --> 3975.94]  We were both church planters.
[3976.62 --> 3979.72]  You've always been an esteemed colleague, a good friend.
[3980.40 --> 3984.06]  And just God's blessings to you and Linda as you continue your journey.
[3984.72 --> 3985.62]  It's awesome to see you.
[3987.74 --> 3988.64]  Good afternoon.
[3990.60 --> 3994.04]  I think you'll agree with me this has been a wonderful day so far.
[3994.04 --> 3995.04]  Can I hear you?
[3996.52 --> 3999.24]  I think you'll agree with me.
[3999.38 --> 4000.86]  It's been a wonderful day so far.
[4000.86 --> 4010.02]  Wonderful displays at the back.
[4012.52 --> 4017.30]  Touching songs, touching words from people, the video, the letters.
[4018.82 --> 4020.54]  There's much joy in this place.
[4020.66 --> 4021.26]  It's tangible.
[4021.26 --> 4034.10]  And I'd like also to echo Joe's comments at the beginning that everyone who helped organize this event has clearly brought praise to God and brought encouragement to this congregation.
[4034.10 --> 4039.94]  And I thank you for allowing me a little bit of time to try and do the same.
[4039.94 --> 4041.94]  Thank you.
[4041.94 --> 4049.10]  First of all, I'd like to acknowledge the pastors who served between 75 and 2000.
[4049.10 --> 4060.98]  Dr. Sidney Graydonis, an exceptional teacher, preacher, author, who eventually taught at Calvin College, King's College, and Calvin Seminary.
[4060.98 --> 4071.10]  Reverend Herman Solomon's, gifted with a kind and pastoral heart, who truly loved and valued the persons entrusted to his care.
[4071.10 --> 4077.26]  Reverend Henry Juncker was highly respected by his colleagues and parishioners.
[4078.40 --> 4079.70]  Henry was forthright.
[4079.70 --> 4084.16]  He was faithful and gifted in everything he did.
[4084.76 --> 4089.58]  Henry left his mark on this congregation, but also the classes and the denomination.
[4090.80 --> 4093.08]  I also want to recognize Ernst de Vries.
[4094.02 --> 4097.44]  Ernst was a dedicated and faithful elder when I was a pastor here.
[4097.56 --> 4100.20]  We served in council together a number of times.
[4100.96 --> 4105.24]  And 20 years later, Ernst ministered in this church as a commission pastor.
[4105.24 --> 4114.82]  All four men served our Lord Jesus Christ and this congregation with integrity, humility, and a sincere faith.
[4115.96 --> 4124.44]  As you know, I think from the displays, the theme for the period 75 to 2000 is growing in faith with each other and our communities.
[4124.98 --> 4131.42]  I have many, many good memories of people and events from the eight years I served as your pastor.
[4131.84 --> 4134.10]  But I only have time enough to share a few.
[4134.10 --> 4135.98]  So let's dig in.
[4137.20 --> 4144.50]  Individual persons have character traits, but so do groups of people like congregations.
[4145.06 --> 4155.98]  And I've chosen two characteristics which I believe this church has and it illustrates God's fingerprints over the 75 years of its history.
[4156.74 --> 4160.92]  First of all, the Ladner Christian Forum Church has a missional heart.
[4161.52 --> 4162.64]  Let me share an example.
[4162.64 --> 4172.22]  In April of 1986, a reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant located near the city of Kiev in the Ukraine exploded.
[4172.22 --> 4182.80]  Apart from the initial casualties, one of the worst effects was acute radiation syndrome, which severely weakened a person's immune system, especially in children.
[4183.92 --> 4193.24]  Fast forward seven years from that date to November 1993, and a member from this congregation, Adrian Goodblood, went to Kiev on a business trip.
[4193.24 --> 4201.18]  Adrian was cut to the heart by the poverty and suffering he saw in Kiev, and we see it constantly today too.
[4202.08 --> 4207.92]  Upon returning to Ladner, he spoke to this congregation about what he had seen and what he had heard.
[4207.92 --> 4214.74]  And soon afterwards, a committee was formed to see what could be done to bring God's love to those hurting in the Ukraine.
[4215.62 --> 4226.34]  Just six months later, a group of 21 children and five adult chaperones were flown from the Ukraine to Ladner in the month of May 1994.
[4226.34 --> 4232.04]  The entire group was hosted in Ladner CRC homes for two weeks.
[4232.62 --> 4238.70]  Jonah and I had two girls who stayed with us, and many of you had children as well.
[4239.70 --> 4242.84]  It was a busy time, but it was a wonderful experience.
[4242.84 --> 4255.12]  I believe this entire church was involved in some shape or form in arranging trips and activities and just doing their best to show God's love to that party of people from the Ukraine.
[4255.94 --> 4261.04]  Above all, and there was a doctor and two nurses who came with the kids.
[4261.16 --> 4268.02]  They said that two weeks here gave those children a boost in their immune system that helped them become a little bit more healthy.
[4268.02 --> 4275.30]  Near the end of the visit, those children said thanks with a talent show with the entire Ladner community involved.
[4275.42 --> 4276.56]  This place was packed.
[4276.70 --> 4280.20]  It was full of people, full of God-given joy.
[4280.92 --> 4286.38]  It was a beautiful and memorable God moment in the life of this congregation, much like today.
[4287.08 --> 4287.86]  Much like today.
[4288.80 --> 4294.06]  I'd like now to briefly list a few other examples of the missional heart of the Ladner Christian Forum Church.
[4294.06 --> 4302.32]  This congregation has a long history of prayerfully and financially supporting various missionaries and their work.
[4302.98 --> 4309.36]  In the 1980s, you supported Reverend Dick and Ann Quantas, who served in both Japan and the Philippines.
[4310.08 --> 4316.38]  In the mid-1970s, this congregation supported and cared for refugees like the Vietnamese boat people,
[4316.74 --> 4321.26]  who came to the Ladner area after the Vietnam War ended in 1975.
[4321.26 --> 4328.48]  But it's your support of a particular Vietnamese refugee family that not only blessed them,
[4329.10 --> 4332.88]  but also has had a lasting impact on a young girl from this congregation.
[4333.90 --> 4337.82]  I'm speaking about Hannah Vanderkamp, daughter of Bart and Adriana.
[4338.58 --> 4345.58]  On the denominational website for Resonate Global Missions, Hannah says, and this is a direct quote,
[4345.58 --> 4354.06]  Watching the Ladner Christian Forum Church community care for the Vietnamese boat family who moved in next door when I was a kid
[4354.06 --> 4362.30]  impressed on me the importance of this people group and how the body of Christ can welcome and support outsiders.
[4363.58 --> 4366.72]  Hannah presently lives in Greece with her husband and family,
[4366.72 --> 4375.16]  and she's part of efforts with a couple of local agencies to help resettle refugees who seek safe haven in that country.
[4376.16 --> 4386.48]  And again, I say to you, what a beautiful example of how God weaves threads of grace from generation to generation and from culture to culture.
[4386.48 --> 4394.60]  And here are a few other examples of how this congregation supported missional efforts with prayers, finances, and volunteers.
[4395.72 --> 4397.38]  Mike and Bev Grunewald and Belize.
[4397.46 --> 4401.08]  And when I think of Mike and Bev, I think of the Banstravan.
[4402.44 --> 4407.64]  Mike and Bev did such great work with young people in this church,
[4407.64 --> 4411.40]  and they carted them everywhere with the Banstravan.
[4412.60 --> 4419.00]  Whenever I came to this church through the week, there was the Banstravan, and there were the Grunewalds.
[4419.34 --> 4426.18]  Just kind of one small indication of the generosity of this church that I've seen in so many different ways.
[4427.22 --> 4430.26]  Gary and Jennifer Rosma in Malaysia.
[4430.26 --> 4438.76]  The Kids Clubhouse VBS program, which we did for several years with a whole bunch of churches in the neighborhood, which was wonderful.
[4439.58 --> 4444.34]  Early 1990s, there was the South Delta-wide outreach co-spondited with Regent College,
[4444.70 --> 4447.04]  with Michael Green being a featured speaker and leader.
[4447.86 --> 4451.28]  West Coast Community Church, of which I was pastor for 18 years.
[4452.54 --> 4456.60]  Unbelievable the amount of generosity we received from this congregation.
[4456.60 --> 4462.40]  And there wasn't a lot of fruit many times, but this church still prayed for us, supported us,
[4462.84 --> 4465.72]  and generously supported us with their monies as well.
[4465.84 --> 4468.96]  There's the Dutch Treat Night fundraisers for missions.
[4469.82 --> 4474.92]  So many God moments to which we humbly bear witness today.
[4475.72 --> 4481.24]  And that brings me to the second personality trait of this congregation I'd like to share with you.
[4481.24 --> 4488.80]  That the Ladner Christian Reformed Church has a kind and caring spirit for its members and its neighbors.
[4489.68 --> 4491.78]  And truly, that is a gift from God.
[4492.50 --> 4498.60]  It's a consequence of God's care and kindness and love, first of all, to us.
[4499.44 --> 4501.70]  As Jeremiah 31, verse 3 says,
[4501.70 --> 4516.72]  On so many occasions, so many times, the years I was a pastor here,
[4517.08 --> 4521.70]  I saw that kind and caring spirit exhibited in this church.
[4521.70 --> 4531.20]  When someone in this church was physically ill or grieving or anxious or downcast,
[4531.62 --> 4539.54]  God raised up other persons in this church to encourage, to comfort, to support and console them.
[4540.40 --> 4541.72]  Sometimes it was an elder.
[4542.58 --> 4544.04]  Sometimes it was a deacon.
[4545.00 --> 4547.64]  At other times, it was a family member or a friend.
[4547.64 --> 4551.94]  And sometimes it was someone that hurting person barely knew.
[4553.20 --> 4562.66]  But in every instance, without fail, it was actually Jesus Christ working in us and through us to help others.
[4563.50 --> 4567.82]  As the Apostle Paul says so beautifully in Galatians 2, verse 20,
[4568.30 --> 4574.22]  I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
[4574.22 --> 4579.18]  The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God,
[4579.40 --> 4582.38]  who loved me and gave himself for me.
[4583.68 --> 4592.82]  I remember in my mind's eye and ears the caring words of elders' prayers for persons in their district.
[4594.12 --> 4598.38]  It was wonderful to meet some of you who have been elders and deacons while I was here.
[4598.38 --> 4603.50]  And just to recall those memories of how caring you were for this church.
[4604.62 --> 4610.16]  I remember the respectful manner in which the deacons supported persons in financial need.
[4610.88 --> 4616.70]  I remember so many times when members of this congregation ministered to each other and in this community.
[4616.86 --> 4622.66]  I'd be going down a driveway to visit someone, and a member of this church would be going up.
[4622.66 --> 4627.32]  I'd be going to the hospital in White Rock or Delta or Richmond,
[4627.72 --> 4630.82]  and I'd meet people who had just left seeing someone there from this church.
[4631.72 --> 4636.66]  A hundred times in the New Testament, the phrase one another is used.
[4637.52 --> 4638.36]  Serve one another.
[4639.22 --> 4640.20]  Forgive one another.
[4641.14 --> 4642.08]  Pray for one another.
[4642.66 --> 4643.56]  Care for one another.
[4644.52 --> 4648.24]  This congregation not only heard those words, you put them into practice.
[4648.24 --> 4655.10]  Countless persons have volunteered their time and talents over the years in various ministries.
[4655.40 --> 4657.64]  Often after a long day of working on the farm.
[4658.42 --> 4661.70]  Maybe getting up at two or three in the morning to milk cows.
[4662.24 --> 4664.14]  Or maybe after a long day at the office.
[4664.32 --> 4667.82]  Or after caring for children all day or teaching children all day at school.
[4668.18 --> 4670.16]  Or after working on a construction site.
[4670.48 --> 4672.20]  You volunteered at the food bank.
[4672.82 --> 4677.82]  You sang on Sunday afternoons at local care homes in the ECU of the hospital.
[4678.24 --> 4680.26]  You helped renovate this building.
[4681.48 --> 4686.86]  The council found out that I was afraid of heights and they took the pulpit off the wall.
[4688.08 --> 4690.68]  I remember coming here and there's people drywalling.
[4690.78 --> 4692.22]  They'd been drywalling all day.
[4693.36 --> 4695.10]  Carpenters who'd been framing all day.
[4695.30 --> 4699.12]  People who didn't work in trades who were coming here and volunteering.
[4699.34 --> 4700.74]  And others helping them out.
[4700.90 --> 4702.12]  Just amazing.
[4702.42 --> 4703.24]  And so much more.
[4703.24 --> 4707.74]  You have served Christ so well with your hands and with your heart.
[4708.64 --> 4713.98]  And in the time remaining I would like to speak shortly about one of those ministries in particular.
[4714.62 --> 4717.46]  When I came to the Ladner-Kershmore Church in 1990.
[4717.68 --> 4723.26]  The Friendship Coffee House program was already a vibrant ministry with over 30 members.
[4724.06 --> 4726.10]  Some came from Bethesda Homes in Richmond.
[4726.72 --> 4727.92]  Some from this church.
[4728.32 --> 4730.38]  And some from the broad near Ladner community.
[4730.38 --> 4735.50]  The program was started by Joyce DeVos and Hilda Bolt over 50 years ago.
[4736.14 --> 4741.10]  And in 1988 the leadership was transferred to Shirley Schulte and Terry Westerhoff.
[4741.60 --> 4748.78]  And over those many years there's always been a strong and dedicated group of volunteers and financial supporters.
[4748.78 --> 4759.52]  The goal was always to provide the friends who came to friendship with fun and fellowship in a safe and supportive environment.
[4760.16 --> 4762.50]  And you have done that so well with God's help.
[4763.30 --> 4768.44]  But a month ago Shirley Schulte shared with me this wonderful story that illustrates that.
[4769.40 --> 4775.18]  A bus was recently needed to transport the many friends from Richmond to Ladner for the Friday night program.
[4775.18 --> 4778.54]  A used bus in good condition was found online.
[4779.48 --> 4781.56]  Terry Westerhoff and a friend checked it out.
[4782.02 --> 4783.74]  Because I know Terry's an awesome mechanic.
[4784.64 --> 4786.62]  A deposit was made in faith.
[4787.26 --> 4792.02]  Soon afterwards the church council enthusiastically approved the purchase.
[4792.76 --> 4795.52]  And subsequent fundraising took care of the balanced sewing.
[4795.52 --> 4807.44]  Again, what a beautiful testimony to the God-given spirit of kindness and caring and love that flows through the veins of this congregation.
[4808.36 --> 4810.54]  I'd like to close with these words.
[4812.18 --> 4815.22]  Author Eugene Peterson wrote a book entitled,
[4815.86 --> 4818.70]  A Long Obedience in the Same Direction.
[4818.70 --> 4823.94]  And that's how I picture this congregation and its service to God.
[4824.78 --> 4827.32]  A Long Obedience in the Same Direction.
[4828.34 --> 4830.00]  The Ladner Christian Reformed Church,
[4830.66 --> 4834.00]  pursuing God's purposes with a missional heart
[4834.00 --> 4837.48]  and with a kind, caring, and loving spirit.
[4838.00 --> 4839.82]  To which in humility we say,
[4840.58 --> 4844.64]  Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[4844.64 --> 4845.92]  Thank you.
[4845.92 --> 4875.90]  Thank you.
[4875.92 --> 4877.92]  Thank you.
[4877.92 --> 4905.90]  Thank you.
[4905.92 --> 4907.92]  Thank you.
[4907.92 --> 4909.92]  Thank you.
[4909.92 --> 4935.90]  Thank you.
[4935.92 --> 4943.14]  I'm so glad to hear you say, Christ.
[4943.14 --> 4949.10]  We went away to earth, to shore,
[4949.86 --> 4952.68]  from the earth to the cross,
[4953.08 --> 4955.72]  our land to land,
[4956.08 --> 4958.78]  from the cross to the grave,
[4959.10 --> 4961.86]  from the rain to the sky,
[4961.86 --> 4965.86]  for our land to be mine.
[4979.86 --> 4983.86]  He is exalted, He is exalted,
[4983.86 --> 4987.86]  of high, amazing,
[4987.86 --> 4992.86]  He is exalted, forever exalted,
[4992.86 --> 4999.86]  and I will praise His name.
[5000.86 --> 5004.86]  He is the Lord,
[5004.86 --> 5008.86]  forever His birth shall be,
[5008.86 --> 5013.86]  forever exalted,
[5013.86 --> 5015.86]  He is the Lord,
[5015.86 --> 5017.86]  He is the Lord,
[5017.86 --> 5019.86]  He is exalted,
[5019.86 --> 5021.86]  He is exalted,
[5021.86 --> 5023.86]  He is exalted,
[5023.86 --> 5025.86]  of high,
[5025.86 --> 5027.86]  He is exalted,
[5027.86 --> 5028.86]  He is exalted,
[5028.86 --> 5030.86]  He is exalted,
[5030.86 --> 5031.86]  He is exalted,
[5031.86 --> 5032.86]  of high.
[5046.86 --> 5052.86]  In 2013, Ladner CRC called a pastor from River Park, Calgary.
[5052.86 --> 5058.86]  Pastor Mike Coote was known as a dynamic preacher with a caring pastoral heart,
[5058.86 --> 5060.86]  and a background in spiritual formation,
[5060.86 --> 5064.86]  and we were delighted that Mike and the family accepted our call.
[5065.86 --> 5068.86]  The Coote family, Pastor Mike, wife Leanne,
[5068.86 --> 5071.86]  and their three children, Nate, Gabe, and Evangeline,
[5071.86 --> 5076.86]  joined us and very quickly became a beloved part of our congregation.
[5076.86 --> 5080.86]  Along with Mike's preaching and pastoring,
[5080.86 --> 5084.86]  we also enjoyed Leanne's singing and vibrant personality,
[5085.86 --> 5088.86]  and the kids becoming part of our church family as well.
[5088.86 --> 5090.86]  It was a treasured time indeed.
[5090.86 --> 5097.86]  And we all felt sad when they decided to move to Chilliwack and a new ministry at Cornerstone CRC,
[5097.86 --> 5099.86]  but we knew that God would bless them there.
[5099.86 --> 5105.86]  I would now like to invite Pastor Mike Coote up to share some time and reflections of their time here.
[5106.86 --> 5107.86]  Thank you.
[5107.86 --> 5108.86]  Thank you.
[5108.86 --> 5109.86]  Thank you.
[5109.86 --> 5110.86]  Thank you.
[5110.86 --> 5111.86]  Thank you.
[5111.86 --> 5112.86]  Thank you.
[5112.86 --> 5113.86]  Thank you.
[5113.86 --> 5114.86]  Thank you.
[5114.86 --> 5115.86]  Thank you.
[5115.86 --> 5116.86]  Thank you.
[5116.86 --> 5117.86]  Oh, man.
[5117.86 --> 5124.86]  It is a real joy to be here, to be with all of you,
[5124.86 --> 5129.86]  to celebrate 75 years of God's faithfulness to this community.
[5129.86 --> 5136.86]  Yeah, it's been a while since I stood here every single Sunday morning,
[5136.86 --> 5141.86]  and yet somehow coming back feels like coming home.
[5141.86 --> 5143.86]  It's so good.
[5143.86 --> 5148.86]  As Gina said, I started as your pastor in 2013, August 1st.
[5148.86 --> 5149.86]  I still remember it.
[5149.86 --> 5152.86]  I preached my first sermon here on August 4th.
[5152.86 --> 5154.86]  Does anybody remember it?
[5154.86 --> 5155.86]  No?
[5155.86 --> 5157.86]  I do, actually.
[5157.86 --> 5165.86]  I do, and I still remember it really, really clearly because I was so nervous that I almost lost my breakfast
[5165.86 --> 5169.86]  about 15 minutes before the service started.
[5169.86 --> 5174.86]  But once I stepped up to preach, it's just like I feel right now.
[5174.86 --> 5185.86]  I had all of these smiling faces looking up at me, kind eyes, people that I knew I could just feel were pulling for me the second that I got up here.
[5185.86 --> 5188.86]  And that, to me, was Ladner CRC.
[5188.86 --> 5191.86]  That was my introduction to all of you.
[5191.86 --> 5195.86]  Even, I'm going to talk about the sermon just for a brief minute.
[5195.86 --> 5198.86]  The sermon was called The Father Heart of God.
[5198.86 --> 5201.86]  I based it on Psalm 103.
[5201.86 --> 5206.86]  And I preached it because I wanted to kind of set the tone for my ministry here among you.
[5206.86 --> 5211.86]  And to tell you that it's all about God, right?
[5211.86 --> 5218.86]  That knowing Him, this Father who has compassion for us, a compassion that never fails.
[5218.86 --> 5219.86]  That's what I wanted to do.
[5219.86 --> 5224.86]  That's the most important thing any of us can know, any of us can pursue.
[5224.86 --> 5228.86]  And in a way, that's kind of how I want to speak to you again today.
[5228.86 --> 5235.86]  Less that focus, but more just so with Scripture at the very center of what I want to say.
[5235.86 --> 5241.86]  Because if anything that I remember about this church is that over its 75 years,
[5241.86 --> 5247.86]  you're a people who love the Word of God and you love the God who speaks through that Word.
[5247.86 --> 5253.86]  And so I want you to listen to this passage from Hebrews 13.
[5253.86 --> 5255.86]  This is what it says.
[5255.86 --> 5263.86]  Now, may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus,
[5263.86 --> 5269.86]  that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing His will,
[5269.86 --> 5277.86]  and may He work in us what is pleasing to Him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
[5277.86 --> 5289.86]  And I actually chose that passage as the last passage for the last sermon that I ever preached here at, well, as your pastor here at Ladner CRC.
[5289.86 --> 5297.86]  And I preached it because in part, and it chose that passage because it felt like the right kind of goodbye.
[5297.86 --> 5301.86]  You know, that passage is a benediction.
[5301.86 --> 5309.86]  And the word goodbye, I even said this in the sermon, it comes from the phrase, God be with ye.
[5309.86 --> 5316.86]  Right? And so when we say goodbye in the Lord, we're saying, God be with you.
[5316.86 --> 5319.86]  And He has been, hasn't He?
[5319.86 --> 5324.86]  For 75 years, God has been with this congregation.
[5324.86 --> 5331.86]  And when I think of my time here, I see what that passage talked about, the great shepherd.
[5331.86 --> 5336.86]  I see the faithfulness of that great shepherd absolutely everywhere I look.
[5336.86 --> 5342.86]  You know, pastors were shepherds too, but pastors come and go.
[5342.86 --> 5353.86]  And, you know, I was very blessed and privileged to follow some really great pastors, pastors like Sid Gradonis, who was my preaching professor.
[5353.86 --> 5359.86]  And every once in a while, he would show up in the pews and sit in the pews right there.
[5359.86 --> 5363.86]  Because he was visiting John and Renee and the family, right?
[5363.86 --> 5368.86]  And I always felt like I was getting a letter grade every week, every time he showed up.
[5368.86 --> 5372.86]  Others like Jim Berry, who's been up here already.
[5372.86 --> 5378.86]  Jim shared with me when I first came lots of really great insights into this congregation.
[5378.86 --> 5381.86]  We went for many, many walks together.
[5381.86 --> 5387.86]  Others like Henry Yonker, who was my pastor too, growing up.
[5387.86 --> 5390.86]  So your pastor was my pastor.
[5390.86 --> 5392.86]  I even dated his daughter for a short time.
[5392.86 --> 5394.86]  Boo!
[5394.86 --> 5395.86]  Boo!
[5395.86 --> 5396.86]  Boo!

[5421.86 --> 5433.86]  презид
[5433.86 --> 5440.36]  and more present, and more faithful than any of us who have ever served here at Ladner CRC ever could be.
[5441.32 --> 5445.72]  And it's always been about him with this congregation, that great shepherd of sheep.
[5446.48 --> 5453.32]  And friends, you all, maybe more than any church that I've served in my time, you've always known that.
[5454.70 --> 5460.04]  You know, this Hebrews passage that I read, it also says that God equips us with everything good for doing his will.
[5460.04 --> 5468.32]  And that's one of the great lessons I think I learned in my time here at Ladner, that ministry is never, ever a solo effort.
[5469.18 --> 5476.38]  You know, it's something that God does in us, and he does it through us together, together, when we come together.
[5476.52 --> 5480.98]  And in my five years, I saw that truth lived out in so many ways.
[5481.58 --> 5485.34]  You partnered with me, you partnered with each other in ministry.
[5485.34 --> 5492.64]  And I think it's the people here of Ladner CRC that impacted me more than anything.
[5493.56 --> 5502.42]  You know, some of you led in worship, some of you taught our kids, you served coffee, you prayed faithfully for us, with us.
[5503.28 --> 5508.88]  You fixed things that were broken, you attended the books, you served as elders and deacons,
[5509.00 --> 5512.88]  people that showed up early and they stayed late, you know.
[5512.88 --> 5521.16]  And you did what God equipped you to do, and in your doing, God was doing.
[5521.94 --> 5523.68]  That's what this passage says too.
[5524.82 --> 5530.78]  And I think of the council members, so many of the just important, important leaders of this church that I worked with,
[5530.84 --> 5536.20]  people like Bart and Tony and Marion and Bev and John and John and John.
[5536.20 --> 5546.42]  And Jake and Andrew and Rita and Bill and Terry and Daryl and Anita and Henry and Bob and Rick and Martin.
[5547.56 --> 5550.58]  And especially Jim and Joe.
[5552.10 --> 5558.56]  Faithful leaders who have loved this church deeply and helped me grow as a pastor and as a person.
[5558.56 --> 5565.76]  And you all showed me, and more importantly, you showed this church that leadership in the church isn't about power.
[5566.50 --> 5569.80]  It's about partnership, it's about humility, and it's about love.
[5570.78 --> 5575.60]  And that's what I remember really deeply about my connection with all of the leaders here.
[5576.32 --> 5583.00]  Some of my fondest memories, though, were the ways that this congregation welcomed our family so incredibly.
[5583.00 --> 5587.86]  And a big part of that for us was how you loved our son Nate.
[5587.96 --> 5592.94]  For those of you that don't know our son Nate's story, he's profoundly autistic.
[5594.58 --> 5598.56]  But I don't know if you remember this, when we first started and I'd come up here to preach,
[5598.92 --> 5603.38]  Nate would walk up from over there and he'd run around in circles behind me, right?
[5603.94 --> 5605.00]  You remember that?
[5605.22 --> 5607.58]  Nobody made a big deal of it, not even once.
[5608.28 --> 5610.34]  And that made us feel like Nate belonged.
[5610.34 --> 5613.36]  And that meant the absolute world to us.
[5613.40 --> 5620.72]  And I was saying to Doug and Jason and Ryan before the service started today that the two of them got together,
[5620.94 --> 5624.26]  and I don't know if you remember this, Nate used to do puzzles in the middle of the service.
[5624.70 --> 5628.90]  And they made Nate a puzzle table that fit over the back of a pew.
[5629.36 --> 5632.78]  They painted it green, and he had this great big space to do.
[5632.84 --> 5636.60]  He still uses that puzzle table, even where we are, every single Sunday.
[5637.38 --> 5639.78]  And so we're so grateful for that.
[5640.34 --> 5645.00]  And my point is, is that you all were Christ's hands and heart to our family,
[5645.24 --> 5647.58]  and that's what this church has been like to me.
[5648.62 --> 5650.90]  And I think of the colleagues that I had here, too.
[5651.30 --> 5654.84]  People like Dorothy and Diane in the office.
[5655.36 --> 5658.96]  And most especially the bonds that I formed with my ministry partners here,
[5659.62 --> 5663.02]  Jeremy and George, and of course, Ernst.
[5663.02 --> 5667.36]  God worked through each and every one of you.
[5667.84 --> 5677.18]  But I also have to say, particularly George, Ernst, Jeremy, you guys shaped me in ways that I still am finding out, right?
[5677.28 --> 5681.54]  You've sharpened me, and you've taught me about grace and faithfulness in community,
[5681.54 --> 5683.60]  and I will never, ever forget those lessons.
[5683.60 --> 5687.54]  In all these things, Hebrews 13 comes to life.
[5687.62 --> 5691.54]  May God work in us what is pleasing to him, and that's what's happened here.
[5692.28 --> 5696.98]  Over the five years that I served, over the 25 years that I'm sort of trying to cover,
[5697.10 --> 5701.58]  and over the 75 years of this church's history, it's been happening for that long.
[5702.12 --> 5704.56]  God doing his work in and through his people.
[5704.56 --> 5707.48]  I want to share some of my most vivid memories, though.
[5707.60 --> 5713.66]  A few little maybe story vignettes that, for me, kind of say it all about Ladner Church.
[5714.28 --> 5719.00]  I remember the first time I had to call to find volunteers for something.
[5719.10 --> 5723.56]  I think it was a council barbecue or a church barbecue of some kind.
[5724.10 --> 5728.62]  It wasn't really important what the event was, but what I remember was I needed 10 people to help.
[5729.34 --> 5731.48]  I made 10 phone calls, and my job was done.
[5731.48 --> 5734.90]  And I thought to myself, wow, that was really easy.
[5735.90 --> 5739.46]  And then my very next thought was, ah, they're just trying to impress the new pastor.
[5740.44 --> 5741.84]  And you know what?
[5741.86 --> 5748.26]  In my five years here, that was more often than not the way that things happened here at Ladner,
[5748.68 --> 5749.60]  and I always loved that.
[5750.46 --> 5753.44]  The next little story I wanted to share was about Bill Limas.
[5754.92 --> 5758.18]  I think it's, you know, Gina said, you know, dynamic preaching.
[5758.18 --> 5764.76]  I think it's safe to say that Bill was one of the ones that didn't love my dynamic preaching.
[5766.94 --> 5768.50]  He wasn't the only one, though.
[5768.60 --> 5771.26]  I remember being, you know, just a few months into my time here,
[5771.34 --> 5773.90]  maybe six or eight months into my time here,
[5774.02 --> 5776.94]  and quite a few people coming to me very up in arms
[5776.94 --> 5781.24]  because it was going around that Hilda Bolt didn't like the new pastor's preaching.
[5781.24 --> 5785.64]  Anyhow, about Bill.
[5787.26 --> 5790.28]  Do you remember that almost every summer that I was here,
[5790.38 --> 5792.88]  we did a sermon series that we called You Asked For It,
[5792.92 --> 5797.60]  but I would ask the congregation to give, you know, some input into what do you want me to preach on?
[5798.44 --> 5802.64]  And, well, that first summer, Bill Limas submitted a request.
[5802.82 --> 5806.40]  He'd always, he said, wanted to hear a sermon on Matthew 17,
[5806.58 --> 5808.24]  the mountain of transfiguration.
[5808.24 --> 5811.66]  And so, you know, I figured I'd oblige him.
[5811.76 --> 5815.00]  And so I, you know, I worked really hard on that sermon, and I preached it.
[5815.54 --> 5816.86]  Never heard a word from Bill.
[5818.48 --> 5822.28]  The next summer, when we did the same series, we did it again,
[5822.60 --> 5824.94]  I got the very same request from Bill.
[5825.04 --> 5827.62]  It was almost like it was a photocopy.
[5827.70 --> 5829.06]  The same words, everything.
[5829.88 --> 5832.94]  And so I thought to myself, you know, well, Bill's getting a little older,
[5833.20 --> 5834.06]  you know, a little older.
[5834.14 --> 5836.62]  Maybe just a touch of dementia here.
[5836.96 --> 5837.82]  He's forgetting.
[5837.82 --> 5841.36]  And so I went to him one Sunday after church, and I said, Bill, you know,
[5841.88 --> 5845.68]  you know, you asked me to preach on Matthew 17.
[5846.34 --> 5849.86]  Did you forget that I preached on that last summer?
[5849.98 --> 5853.14]  To which he replied, no, pastor, I didn't forget.
[5853.48 --> 5855.58]  I just thought you might like another chance.
[5855.58 --> 5864.10]  I love it.
[5864.10 --> 5864.58]  Right?
[5864.74 --> 5871.26]  Like, it was a dig and somehow gracious all at once, you know?
[5871.26 --> 5876.32]  And that was the thing that I found about this congregation.
[5876.32 --> 5881.86]  My sense of the people here in this church is that you don't hide from the truth,
[5882.30 --> 5888.86]  but you also understand, like George says, you understand grace in a profound kind of way.
[5888.86 --> 5896.26]  Some of my clearest memories actually are about the basic skills camp that this church for many years.
[5896.32 --> 5898.10]  Do we still do that here, basic skills?
[5898.28 --> 5899.22]  Yeah, that's still happening.
[5900.82 --> 5901.86]  Kids club as well.
[5901.86 --> 5911.00]  These are long-running ministries that were focused on evangelizing and giving the gospel to our neighborhood kids.
[5911.70 --> 5916.76]  I think those were startups of the former associate pastor, Jed Shep.
[5916.76 --> 5922.54]  And I remember doing the Bible story time at those, and it got me, you know,
[5922.58 --> 5928.98]  it gave me an opportunity to try out my pirate accent and one year my French accent and a number of different things.
[5929.08 --> 5935.58]  But what I think I remember most is that I don't think I have ever seen a church pull together to do something
[5935.58 --> 5939.48]  quite like you pulled together to pull off basic skills.
[5939.48 --> 5947.16]  I would say 80, maybe 90% of the church was in some way involved in that ministry.
[5947.38 --> 5954.72]  Hans Verhoef with all of his woodworking stuff and Pat and Winnie and Adriana and all their sewing projects.
[5955.02 --> 5958.86]  And almost everyone was involved in one way or another.
[5959.12 --> 5961.86]  We still have some of those projects in our home, by the way.
[5962.30 --> 5963.38]  Our kids love that.
[5963.38 --> 5970.52]  In my time here, we also took our first tentative steps into cross-cultural ministry
[5970.52 --> 5976.38]  by inviting Pastor David with his Church of Cantonese-speaking Christians in.
[5977.28 --> 5983.32]  And they worshipped and fellowshiped simultaneously at the same time as us over in the fireside room.
[5984.26 --> 5987.06]  And we even did an English and Cantonese service.
[5987.22 --> 5988.20]  Do you remember that?
[5988.26 --> 5989.12]  Do you all remember that?
[5989.12 --> 5994.48]  I had to really slow down my preaching, you know, like one little bite-sized thing at a time
[5994.48 --> 5995.50]  and then it would get translated.
[5996.26 --> 6001.66]  Anyhow, while that church, of course, is gone, is no longer here,
[6001.72 --> 6005.06]  there's another Chinese ministry that I think has taken its place.
[6005.22 --> 6005.94]  What a gift.
[6007.32 --> 6010.70]  And so what I want to say to you all in closing, friends,
[6010.70 --> 6017.74]  is that as you celebrate this incredible milestone, this anniversary,
[6017.88 --> 6021.56]  I want to remind you of what has always been true.
[6022.22 --> 6028.04]  That the story of Ladner CRC is not first about pastors or programs or buildings.
[6028.70 --> 6030.92]  It's a story of a faithful God.
[6031.76 --> 6035.42]  The God of peace who keeps raising up his people.
[6035.42 --> 6042.46]  He keeps equipping them, gathering them, equipping them to do his will in the world.
[6043.42 --> 6047.56]  And so I want to encourage you to keep trusting that great shepherd.
[6047.74 --> 6048.48]  He's still leading.
[6049.04 --> 6053.68]  He's still equipping you to do everything good you need to do his will.
[6053.76 --> 6057.24]  And he's still working in you what is pleasing to him.
[6057.32 --> 6060.06]  He's been faithful for 75 years.
[6060.32 --> 6063.10]  He will be faithful for many, many more.
[6063.10 --> 6067.70]  And once again, friends, God be with ye.
[6067.70 --> 6068.70]  Thank you.
[6068.70 --> 6069.70]  Thank you.
[6093.10 --> 6093.46]  And all the hearts and filled Gates tomorrow.
[6093.46 --> 6101.84]  How many of our которого Amen does not trust in God and trust in God,
[6101.84 --> 6106.78]  When he grows up or shows in Him over to us.
[6106.78 --> 6106.84]  Alyssa County Everywhere has grown better than what has always been чудamized.
[6106.84 --> 6108.72]  In Ar트 Cement John liveavement 2.
[6108.90 --> 6109.34]  Thank you.
[6109.34 --> 6112.36]  But let's see.
[6112.36 --> 6112.52]  If we will come to the eye of his will in the midst of another lingering morning,
[6112.52 --> 6113.62]  At Calvary制ation that local council said ask Gold Saved a Eleven friend for the night,
[6113.64 --> 6116.16]  He is still playing.
[6116.22 --> 6116.60]  The Mountavement 2.
[6116.60 --> 6120.60]  There's running toесь ill지만 way of himself.
[6120.74 --> 6121.92]  He's still playing on their way of the word pro- Saiyan one has on our list of the night that inflation and
[6121.94 --> 6122.76]  say Jamuvre sc2015.
[6122.76 --> 6128.68]  Still the holy is our heart
[6128.68 --> 6132.06]  Lost in our way
[6132.06 --> 6138.00]  The holy is our heart
[6138.00 --> 6145.02]  Sing age to age as the heavens
[6145.02 --> 6148.96]  And time is in your sense
[6148.96 --> 6155.02]  Beginning and the end
[6155.02 --> 6160.44]  That God is believing all in you
[6160.44 --> 6164.58]  God is believing all in you
[6164.58 --> 6167.02]  And I am the man
[6167.02 --> 6170.40]  And I am the man
[6170.40 --> 6175.00]  And we praise our heart
[6175.00 --> 6180.06]  Sing the holy is our heart
[6180.06 --> 6188.62]  Cause the holy is our heart
[6188.62 --> 6196.06]  Sing the holy is
[6196.06 --> 6201.12]  Burning up all days
[6201.12 --> 6206.24]  And I am still in your days
[6206.24 --> 6209.68]  We praise our heart
[6209.68 --> 6216.12]  Sing the holy is
[6216.12 --> 6220.12]  Burning up all days
[6220.12 --> 6225.18]  I am still in your days
[6225.18 --> 6228.18]  And we praise our God
[6228.18 --> 6234.66]  For the great is our God
[6234.66 --> 6239.18]  Sing the holy is our God
[6239.18 --> 6243.18]  Lost in our way
[6243.18 --> 6248.10]  The great is our God
[6248.10 --> 6261.94]  Just a couple of things
[6261.94 --> 6268.22]  Everybody I wish could witness
[6268.22 --> 6270.68]  What I sometimes witness
[6270.68 --> 6272.00]  Being up front here
[6272.00 --> 6274.14]  Or sitting up front here
[6274.14 --> 6279.38]  The singing is just absolutely fantastic
[6279.38 --> 6282.18]  And you really really feel it
[6282.18 --> 6282.98]  When you are up front
[6282.98 --> 6285.24]  And I am reminded of
[6285.24 --> 6286.80]  One of our speakers
[6286.80 --> 6287.38]  Bill
[6287.38 --> 6289.04]  Pastor Bill
[6289.04 --> 6290.12]  Mentioning that
[6290.12 --> 6293.34]  He heard from others
[6293.34 --> 6294.96]  About our singing
[6294.96 --> 6297.80]  Way back in his time here
[6297.80 --> 6299.52]  Way back in the 50's
[6299.52 --> 6301.46]  This church was known
[6301.46 --> 6302.32]  For its singing
[6302.32 --> 6304.06]  And we still do it
[6304.06 --> 6304.78]  Very well
[6304.78 --> 6308.38]  I have to apologize
[6308.38 --> 6310.88]  To Jim Barry
[6310.88 --> 6313.86]  I don't know what made me do it
[6313.86 --> 6314.84]  I just had to Jim
[6314.84 --> 6315.36]  You know
[6315.36 --> 6316.34]  Wear that shirt
[6316.34 --> 6318.20]  But then I got thinking
[6318.20 --> 6319.56]  And I was thinking
[6319.56 --> 6321.50]  When Pastor Mike was up here
[6321.50 --> 6326.56]  I followed up here
[6326.56 --> 6329.76]  Because when Mike and Leanne
[6329.76 --> 6331.54]  And family came here
[6331.54 --> 6332.66]  To consider
[6332.66 --> 6333.82]  To have a look around
[6333.82 --> 6335.16]  And consider the call here
[6335.16 --> 6336.88]  I was fortunate enough
[6336.88 --> 6338.04]  To be able to take him
[6338.04 --> 6340.00]  To a Canuck practice
[6340.00 --> 6342.34]  And they came from Alberta
[6342.34 --> 6343.56]  I believe they were
[6343.56 --> 6345.18]  Flame fans
[6345.18 --> 6347.42]  But that
[6347.42 --> 6350.48]  That completely changed
[6350.48 --> 6352.40]  Completely changed
[6352.40 --> 6354.42]  They became avid Canuck fans
[6354.42 --> 6356.56]  I'm sorry that I never
[6356.56 --> 6358.74]  When you were visiting here
[6358.74 --> 6360.70]  Take you and introduce you
[6360.70 --> 6361.38]  To the Canucks
[6361.38 --> 6362.48]  That I think
[6362.48 --> 6363.10]  Would have done it
[6363.10 --> 6364.54]  Hopefully the sweater
[6364.54 --> 6365.28]  Does it now
[6365.28 --> 6373.30]  Is Winnie?
[6373.88 --> 6374.48]  Winnie here?
[6374.48 --> 6378.26]  Okay
[6378.26 --> 6379.14]  Good
[6379.14 --> 6380.00]  That's fine
[6380.00 --> 6383.82]  The displays that you've had
[6383.82 --> 6385.14]  The opportunity to see
[6385.14 --> 6386.56]  And that we showed
[6386.56 --> 6388.48]  Hopefully with
[6388.48 --> 6390.62]  The history of all of the pastors
[6390.62 --> 6392.22]  Of Ladner CRC
[6392.22 --> 6394.74]  Over the past 75 years
[6394.74 --> 6399.10]  Many have been mentioned
[6399.10 --> 6401.48]  Some you have seen
[6401.48 --> 6403.18]  From this pulpit
[6403.18 --> 6405.98]  They're all pictured there
[6405.98 --> 6408.32]  We would like to
[6408.32 --> 6408.80]  However
[6408.80 --> 6413.38]  Acknowledge
[6413.38 --> 6416.66]  Two pastors
[6416.66 --> 6419.38]  That have been taken home
[6419.38 --> 6419.92]  To glory
[6419.92 --> 6422.34]  With the citation
[6422.34 --> 6424.38]  Well done
[6424.38 --> 6426.32]  Good and faithful servants
[6426.32 --> 6430.82]  Enter into the joy
[6430.82 --> 6431.94]  Of the master
[6431.94 --> 6442.32]  Pastor Henry Yonker
[6442.32 --> 6444.14]  Was called to Ladner CRC
[6444.14 --> 6447.36]  In early 1999
[6447.36 --> 6451.70]  And served here
[6451.70 --> 6453.24]  Until his retirement
[6453.24 --> 6454.86]  In 2011
[6454.86 --> 6458.00]  He was the longest
[6458.00 --> 6459.22]  Serving pastor
[6459.22 --> 6461.28]  In this church community
[6461.28 --> 6462.68]  Up until now
[6462.68 --> 6465.66]  Henry has been described
[6465.66 --> 6466.50]  As
[6466.50 --> 6469.18]  A man of perseverance
[6469.18 --> 6470.40]  And empathy
[6470.40 --> 6472.26]  Serious
[6472.26 --> 6474.66]  But non-judgmental

[6533.92 --> 6535.58]  In December 2020
[6535.58 --> 6537.36]  Three months
[6537.36 --> 6539.66]  After a cancer diagnosis
[6539.66 --> 6542.44]  Pastor Henry

[6544.74 --> 6545.36]  Of marriage

[6547.48 --> 6553.92]  In mid-1985
[6553.92 --> 6555.30]  A young
[6555.30 --> 6556.82]  Newly married couple

[6561.72 --> 6564.84]  Ernst and Winnie De Vries
[6564.84 --> 6566.82]  Instantly became
[6566.82 --> 6567.42]  Well known
[6567.42 --> 6569.10]  In this church community
[6569.10 --> 6570.08]  And the community

[6572.52 --> 6574.24]  Taught at DCS

[6576.18 --> 6577.40]  At Howling Nurseries
[6577.40 --> 6578.92]  Ernst was
[6578.92 --> 6580.98]  A man
[6580.98 --> 6581.90]  With a boisterous
[6581.90 --> 6582.36]  Laugh
[6582.36 --> 6583.36]  Laugh
[6583.36 --> 6584.04]  Laugh

[6587.18 --> 6588.38]  Singing voice
[6588.38 --> 6590.74]  He also had
[6590.74 --> 6591.72]  A huge love
[6591.72 --> 6592.78]  For evangelism
[6592.78 --> 6594.04]  And
[6594.04 --> 6595.20]  Sharing
[6595.20 --> 6596.26]  About Jesus
[6596.26 --> 6597.60]  In this community
[6597.60 --> 6600.66]  Ernst soon learned
[6600.66 --> 6602.46]  About the ministry
[6602.46 --> 6603.36]  To seafarers
[6603.36 --> 6604.78]  And began
[6604.78 --> 6605.62]  Ship visiting
[6605.62 --> 6608.14]  That will come back
[6608.14 --> 6608.50]  Again
[6608.50 --> 6610.32]  It didn't take long
[6610.32 --> 6611.34]  Until Ernst was called
[6611.34 --> 6612.40]  To the office of elder
[6612.40 --> 6613.22]  In this church
[6613.22 --> 6614.40]  An office
[6614.40 --> 6615.72]  He held often
[6615.72 --> 6617.34]  And for
[6617.34 --> 6619.16]  Substantial periods
[6619.16 --> 6619.60]  Of time
[6619.60 --> 6621.34]  He became known
[6621.34 --> 6623.40]  For his pastoral work
[6623.40 --> 6624.92]  Especially
[6624.92 --> 6625.94]  Visiting
[6625.94 --> 6626.66]  The sick
[6626.66 --> 6628.48]  The elderly
[6628.48 --> 6629.86]  Seniors
[6629.86 --> 6631.12]  And those
[6631.12 --> 6631.66]  That just
[6631.66 --> 6632.58]  Needed a visit
[6632.58 --> 6635.50]  He was a chaplain
[6635.50 --> 6637.00]  For several years
[6637.00 --> 6638.62]  At Delta View
[6638.62 --> 6639.86]  A care home
[6639.86 --> 6642.46]  For his employment
[6642.46 --> 6642.92]  He
[6642.92 --> 6644.16]  For his enjoyment
[6644.16 --> 6644.64]  Sorry
[6644.64 --> 6646.22]  He even sang
[6646.22 --> 6648.72]  The anthems
[6648.72 --> 6650.12]  At the Vancouver
[6650.12 --> 6650.98]  Giants
[6650.98 --> 6652.50]  Junior hockey games
[6652.50 --> 6654.84]  His visiting
[6654.84 --> 6656.40]  And yes
[6656.40 --> 6657.86]  Some of his socializing
[6657.86 --> 6659.34]  Invariably
[6659.34 --> 6660.30]  Included
[6660.30 --> 6660.86]  Ernst
[6660.86 --> 6661.50]  Speaking
[6661.50 --> 6662.54]  In the
[6662.54 --> 6663.50]  Frisian language
[6663.50 --> 6665.28]  Some
[6665.28 --> 6666.58]  That didn't
[6666.58 --> 6667.76]  Even make sense
[6667.76 --> 6668.44]  To just
[6668.44 --> 6669.00]  A regular
[6669.00 --> 6669.76]  Dutch speaking
[6669.76 --> 6670.16]  Person
[6670.16 --> 6670.64]  Like me
[6670.64 --> 6672.26]  He just
[6672.26 --> 6673.62]  Couldn't help it
[6673.62 --> 6675.28]  Years later
[6675.28 --> 6676.82]  A calling
[6676.82 --> 6677.44]  Led to
[6677.44 --> 6678.12]  A change
[6678.12 --> 6678.88]  In vocations
[6678.88 --> 6679.56]  For Ernst
[6679.56 --> 6681.04]  He became
[6681.04 --> 6681.76]  The chaplain

[6684.36 --> 6685.36]  Became
[6685.36 --> 6685.96]  A commissioned
[6685.96 --> 6686.74]  Pastor

[6687.54 --> 6689.16]  Licensed
[6689.16 --> 6689.58]  To preach
[6689.58 --> 6691.66]  He preached
[6691.66 --> 6692.80]  Many times
[6692.80 --> 6693.82]  Off of this pulpit
[6693.82 --> 6695.20]  And
[6695.20 --> 6696.36]  In many churches
[6696.36 --> 6697.12]  Other churches
[6697.12 --> 6697.82]  Here in BC
[6697.82 --> 6698.78]  Even churches
[6698.78 --> 6699.32]  In Alberta
[6699.32 --> 6700.92]  Ernst
[6700.92 --> 6701.62]  Was a tremendous
[6701.62 --> 6702.36]  Help within
[6702.36 --> 6703.10]  This community
[6703.10 --> 6704.16]  This church
[6704.16 --> 6704.76]  Community
[6704.76 --> 6705.56]  And congregation
[6705.56 --> 6706.92]  His energy
[6706.92 --> 6708.14]  Diligence
[6708.14 --> 6709.66]  Enthusiasm
[6709.66 --> 6710.64]  Just knew
[6710.64 --> 6711.30]  No bounds
[6711.30 --> 6712.74]  At one point
[6712.74 --> 6713.86]  He even
[6713.86 --> 6714.48]  Publicly
[6714.48 --> 6715.16]  Offered up
[6715.16 --> 6716.16]  Wife
[6716.16 --> 6716.84]  Winnie's
[6716.84 --> 6717.26]  Van
[6717.26 --> 6718.54]  By now
[6718.54 --> 6718.96]  She was
[6718.96 --> 6719.42]  I think
[6719.42 --> 6720.20]  Transporting
[6720.20 --> 6721.22]  Five children
[6721.22 --> 6723.08]  But Ernst
[6723.08 --> 6724.08]  Was bound
[6724.08 --> 6724.62]  And determined
[6724.62 --> 6725.66]  Simply to help
[6725.66 --> 6726.74]  Our youth
[6726.74 --> 6727.48]  Activities

[6732.90 --> 6734.18]  Ernst
[6734.18 --> 6734.80]  Ensured
[6734.80 --> 6735.66]  Our pulpit
[6735.66 --> 6736.34]  Was filled
[6736.34 --> 6737.64]  Either
[6737.64 --> 6738.74]  By himself
[6738.74 --> 6739.98]  Or by
[6739.98 --> 6740.78]  Ensuring
[6740.78 --> 6741.60]  That another
[6741.60 --> 6742.06]  Pastor
[6742.06 --> 6742.98]  Would be here
[6742.98 --> 6743.40]  To preach

[6750.28 --> 6751.04]  In this church
[6751.04 --> 6752.40]  And immediately
[6752.40 --> 6753.40]  Started a
[6753.40 --> 6754.12]  Coffee
[6754.12 --> 6754.64]  Clitz
[6754.64 --> 6756.02]  That's a
[6756.02 --> 6756.30]  Coffee
[6756.30 --> 6756.92]  Gathering
[6756.92 --> 6758.30]  For anyone
[6758.30 --> 6759.12]  In this church
[6759.12 --> 6760.46]  Out of the church

[6761.68 --> 6762.34]  Mornings
[6762.34 --> 6763.86]  That's still
[6763.86 --> 6764.84]  A mainstay
[6764.84 --> 6765.76]  To this day
[6765.76 --> 6768.98]  I was around
[6768.98 --> 6769.80]  His table
[6769.80 --> 6771.74]  That's the only
[6771.74 --> 6772.32]  Thing
[6772.32 --> 6772.76]  Ernst
[6772.76 --> 6773.38]  Never did
[6773.38 --> 6774.16]  He didn't
[6774.16 --> 6774.60]  Replace
[6774.60 --> 6775.28]  That table
[6775.28 --> 6775.80]  Because he
[6775.80 --> 6776.14]  Took it
[6776.14 --> 6776.46]  With him
[6776.46 --> 6777.12]  To Pinocca
[6777.12 --> 6780.60]  In late
[6780.60 --> 6781.40]  2020
[6781.40 --> 6782.02]  Ernst
[6782.02 --> 6782.52]  And Winnie
[6782.52 --> 6783.54]  Left Ladner
[6783.54 --> 6784.86]  And did
[6784.86 --> 6785.28]  Move
[6785.28 --> 6786.12]  To Pinocca
[6786.12 --> 6787.36]  To be
[6787.36 --> 6787.70]  Closer
[6787.70 --> 6788.40]  To children
[6788.40 --> 6789.70]  And probably
[6789.70 --> 6790.28]  Affordable
[6790.28 --> 6790.76]  Housing
[6790.76 --> 6792.72]  Almost
[6792.72 --> 6793.30]  Instantly
[6793.30 --> 6794.48]  Ernst
[6794.48 --> 6795.12]  Found himself
[6795.12 --> 6795.70]  In the same
[6795.70 --> 6796.20]  Spot he
[6796.20 --> 6796.80]  Was here
[6796.80 --> 6797.32]  In Ladner
[6797.32 --> 6798.64]  Busy

[7279.02 --> 7279.14]  To
[7279.14 --> 7279.34]  Do
[7279.34 --> 7280.10]  An

[7280.56 --> 7280.90]  Sermon
[7280.90 --> 7281.20]  Series
[7281.20 --> 7281.60]  On

[7288.16 --> 7288.50]  To
[7288.50 --> 7289.18]  To

[7290.62 --> 7290.80]  Of
[7290.80 --> 7291.04]  Jesus
[7291.04 --> 7292.72]  Now
[7292.72 --> 7292.98]  The
[7292.98 --> 7293.32]  Third
[7293.32 --> 7293.60]  Thing
[7293.60 --> 7293.76]  We
[7293.76 --> 7293.98]  Want
[7293.98 --> 7294.12]  To
[7294.12 --> 7294.38]  Lean
[7294.38 --> 7294.70]  Into
[7294.70 --> 7295.12]  Together
[7295.12 --> 7295.50]  Is
[7295.50 --> 7295.68]  To
[7295.68 --> 7296.16]  Continue
[7296.16 --> 7296.36]  To
[7296.36 --> 7296.74]  Grow
[7296.74 --> 7297.42]  As
[7297.42 --> 7297.60]  A
[7297.60 --> 7297.86]  Multi
[7297.86 --> 7298.38]  Ethnic
[7298.38 --> 7298.62]  And
[7298.62 --> 7298.88]  Multi
[7298.88 --> 7299.82]  Generational
[7299.82 --> 7300.88]  Community
[7300.88 --> 7302.02]  And
[7302.02 --> 7302.28]  So
[7302.28 --> 7302.54]  I
[7302.54 --> 7302.62]  I'm
[7302.62 --> 7302.74]  Going
[7302.74 --> 7302.96]  To
[7302.96 --> 7303.44]  Invite
[7303.44 --> 7303.78]  Phillip
[7303.78 --> 7304.40]  To
[7304.40 --> 7305.32]  Speak
[7305.32 --> 7305.48]  A
[7305.48 --> 7305.60]  Bit
[7305.60 --> 7305.84]  About
[7305.84 --> 7306.10]  That
[7306.10 --> 7309.22]  So
[7309.22 --> 7310.26]  Why
[7310.26 --> 7310.74]  A
[7310.74 --> 7312.10]  Multi
[7312.10 --> 7314.10]  Ethnic
[7314.10 --> 7314.66]  Right
[7314.66 --> 7315.72]  Naturally
[7315.72 --> 7316.04]  It's
[7316.04 --> 7316.50]  Supposed
[7316.50 --> 7316.62]  To
[7316.62 --> 7316.76]  Be
[7316.76 --> 7317.54]  In
[7317.54 --> 7317.66]  The
[7317.66 --> 7318.56]  Bible
[7318.56 --> 7319.44]  The
[7319.44 --> 7319.92]  Church
[7319.92 --> 7320.44]  Is
[7320.44 --> 7320.74]  Supposed
[7320.74 --> 7320.86]  To
[7320.86 --> 7321.02]  Be
[7321.02 --> 7321.32]  Like
[7321.32 --> 7322.06]  Multi
[7322.06 --> 7323.22]  Ethnic
[7323.22 --> 7324.18]  Many
[7324.18 --> 7324.70]  Different
[7324.70 --> 7325.30]  People
[7325.30 --> 7326.00]  Joining
[7326.00 --> 7326.44]  Together
[7326.44 --> 7326.72]  Right
[7326.72 --> 7326.96]  So
[7326.96 --> 7327.54]  But
[7327.54 --> 7327.74]  In
[7327.74 --> 7328.18]  Practical
[7328.18 --> 7328.54]  It's
[7328.54 --> 7328.88]  Really
[7328.88 --> 7329.82]  Not
[7329.82 --> 7330.00]  That
[7330.00 --> 7330.30]  Easy
[7330.30 --> 7331.48]  So
[7331.48 --> 7333.64]  My
[7333.64 --> 7334.06]  Previous
[7334.06 --> 7334.46]  Church
[7334.46 --> 7334.84]  Was
[7334.84 --> 7335.14]  A
[7335.14 --> 7335.92]  Chinese
[7335.92 --> 7336.20]  Only
[7336.20 --> 7336.56]  Church
[7336.56 --> 7337.62]  Only
[7337.62 --> 7338.08]  One
[7338.08 --> 7338.60]  Brother
[7338.60 --> 7339.24]  You
[7339.24 --> 7339.38]  Know
[7339.38 --> 7340.10]  Caucasian
[7340.10 --> 7340.88]  So
[7340.88 --> 7341.50]  We
[7341.50 --> 7341.80]  Had
[7341.80 --> 7342.08]  Some
[7342.08 --> 7343.64]  Challenges
[7343.64 --> 7345.76]  We
[7345.76 --> 7346.12]  Are
[7346.12 --> 7346.32]  In
[7346.32 --> 7346.48]  The
[7346.48 --> 7346.74]  Middle
[7346.74 --> 7347.26]  My
[7347.26 --> 7347.64]  Age
[7347.64 --> 7348.08]  Right
[7348.08 --> 7348.70]  Our
[7348.70 --> 7349.24]  Parents
[7349.24 --> 7349.72]  They
[7349.72 --> 7349.92]  Are
[7349.92 --> 7350.66]  Chinese
[7350.66 --> 7351.00]  Only
[7351.00 --> 7351.78]  And
[7351.78 --> 7351.98]  Our
[7351.98 --> 7352.80]  Children
[7352.80 --> 7353.50]  They
[7353.50 --> 7353.68]  Are
[7353.68 --> 7354.16]  English
[7354.16 --> 7354.46]  Only
[7354.46 --> 7355.46]  So
[7355.46 --> 7355.66]  We
[7355.66 --> 7355.84]  Are
[7355.84 --> 7356.84]  Between
[7356.84 --> 7357.48]  50
[7357.48 --> 7357.80]  50
[7357.80 --> 7358.12]  So
[7358.12 --> 7358.96]  So
[7358.96 --> 7359.20]  It's
[7359.20 --> 7359.36]  Really
[7359.36 --> 7359.70]  Hard
[7359.70 --> 7359.92]  For
[7359.92 --> 7360.18]  Us
[7360.18 --> 7360.52]  To
[7360.52 --> 7361.54]  Accommodate
[7361.54 --> 7362.14]  Both
[7362.14 --> 7362.32]  Of
[7362.32 --> 7362.52]  Them
[7362.52 --> 7363.82]  So
[7363.82 --> 7365.08]  We
[7365.08 --> 7365.48]  Try
[7365.48 --> 7366.14]  Very
[7366.14 --> 7366.38]  Very
[7366.38 --> 7366.70]  Hard
[7366.70 --> 7366.94]  So
[7366.94 --> 7367.14]  We
[7367.14 --> 7367.64]  Translate
[7367.64 --> 7367.96]  Every
[7367.96 --> 7368.42]  Sermon
[7368.42 --> 7368.78]  Into
[7368.78 --> 7369.74]  English
[7369.74 --> 7370.08]  Or
[7370.08 --> 7370.56]  Chinese
[7370.56 --> 7370.86]  So
[7370.86 --> 7371.38]  Both
[7371.38 --> 7371.90]  Speaking
[7371.90 --> 7372.78]  Side
[7372.78 --> 7372.94]  By
[7372.94 --> 7373.20]  Side
[7373.20 --> 7374.24]  Now
[7374.24 --> 7374.58]  Then
[7374.58 --> 7374.76]  We
[7374.76 --> 7375.04]  Have
[7375.04 --> 7375.26]  Some
[7375.26 --> 7375.66]  English
[7375.66 --> 7376.34]  Fellowship
[7376.34 --> 7376.54]  In
[7376.54 --> 7376.76]  This
[7376.76 --> 7377.10]  Bible
[7377.10 --> 7377.50]  Study
[7377.50 --> 7379.08]  English
[7379.08 --> 7379.40]  Whatever
[7379.40 --> 7379.72]  We
[7379.72 --> 7379.90]  Can
[7379.90 --> 7380.12]  Do
[7380.12 --> 7380.62]  Put
[7380.62 --> 7380.86]  Into
[7380.86 --> 7381.36]  English

[7660.58 --> 7664.58]  Our love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[7664.58 --> 7669.58]  Raise your voice now, know how it's made.
[7669.58 --> 7675.58]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[7683.58 --> 7695.58]  You may be seated, I think.
[7695.58 --> 7698.58]  So we're right at the end of our program,
[7698.58 --> 7701.58]  and what I'd like to do is lead us in a closing prayer
[7701.58 --> 7704.58]  before I just make a few kind of closing remarks.
[7704.58 --> 7708.58]  So let's pray together.
[7708.58 --> 7713.58]  We will remember the deeds of the Lord.
[7713.58 --> 7719.58]  Yes, we will remember your miracles of long ago.
[7719.58 --> 7724.58]  Gracious God, we give you thanks today as we celebrate, again,
[7724.58 --> 7731.58]  75 years of your faithfulness to us here at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[7731.58 --> 7734.58]  Lord, you have been with us all along the way,
[7734.58 --> 7738.58]  doing your work in and through us by your grace.
[7738.58 --> 7744.58]  You have enabled this church to be a place of fellowship and community,
[7744.58 --> 7750.58]  a place of worship and preaching, a place of mission and service.
[7750.58 --> 7754.58]  Lord, you have led us, and you have been sovereign over,
[7754.58 --> 7760.58]  as George prayed earlier, the mountaintops and the valleys.
[7760.58 --> 7765.58]  And Lord, you have traveled with us, and we have traveled under your protection and your love.
[7765.58 --> 7770.58]  We thank you, Lord, for each person that you have brought into our fellowship over the years,
[7770.58 --> 7775.58]  those who are still with us, those whom you have called to other places,
[7775.58 --> 7779.58]  and those who are now at rest in your presence.
[7779.58 --> 7783.58]  Lord, we thank you for all of the baptisms that we've celebrated,
[7783.58 --> 7786.58]  the professions of faith that have been made,
[7786.58 --> 7789.58]  the answers to prayer that we have experienced.
[7789.58 --> 7797.58]  Lord, we thank you for the many pastors, elders, deacons, and other leaders that you have raised up among us.
[7797.58 --> 7805.58]  We thank you for a congregation that has always desired to worship you faithfully and vibrantly,
[7805.58 --> 7807.58]  hearing your word and singing your praises.
[7807.58 --> 7813.58]  Thank you, Lord, for the generosity that has enabled us to reach far beyond this community
[7813.58 --> 7815.58]  with the word and the witness of the gospel.
[7815.58 --> 7820.58]  Lord, and you are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger,
[7820.58 --> 7828.58]  abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousands of generations.
[7828.58 --> 7831.58]  And so we pray, Lord, for the future of this church.
[7831.58 --> 7838.58]  Would you help us to carry on the legacy of your faithfulness for decades to come,
[7838.58 --> 7842.58]  so that future generations would know and worship you.
[7842.58 --> 7848.58]  We pray for our children and our youth and for generations yet to come.
[7848.58 --> 7854.58]  And we desire, Lord, that you will continue to use us to reach many here within our community
[7854.58 --> 7857.58]  and throughout the world with the good news of the gospel,
[7857.58 --> 7862.58]  so that they may know your love and in their sin find your grace.
[7862.58 --> 7866.58]  O Lord, hear our prayer for your glory and your praise.
[7866.58 --> 7870.58]  And all of God's people said, Amen.
[7872.58 --> 7876.58]  It has been wonderful to worship together, to be together today.
[7876.58 --> 7884.58]  And each one of you here has been a part of the story of Latin or CRC in different ways.
[7884.58 --> 7890.58]  And so thank you for taking your time to come today to be part of this special celebration.
[7890.58 --> 7900.58]  And I especially want to thank our anniversary committee for all of the time and the work that they have put in to making this day special.
[7900.58 --> 7903.58]  So let's give them a round of applause.
[7903.58 --> 7912.58]  The committee members are Chris Banstra, Pat Krusinga, Joan Van Toll,
[7912.58 --> 7916.58]  Marion Van Drill, Joel Schulk, and Gina Frazier.
[7916.58 --> 7921.58]  And let's also give thanks to Roger Gross, who was on the piano or organ for us earlier.
[7921.58 --> 7925.58]  And also Jim DeClear on the violin.
[7930.58 --> 7935.58]  And you are invited to stay right after for continued time of fellowship to see the displays,
[7935.58 --> 7941.58]  if you haven't had a chance to do that, and to enjoy some coffee and a celebratory cake.
[7941.58 --> 7943.58]  So please do stay.
[7943.58 --> 7945.58]  Very last announcement for a few of you.
[7945.58 --> 7950.58]  If you are in the choir, please stay for a rehearsal at 515.
[7950.58 --> 7951.58]  I don't know what time it is.
[7951.58 --> 7952.58]  But...
[7953.58 --> 7955.58]  So just stay here.
[7956.58 --> 7959.58]  And everyone else, thank you for joining.
[7959.58 --> 7961.58]  Thank you for joining.
[7961.58 --> 7963.58]  Thank you.
[7963.58 --> 7976.58]  Thank you.
[7976.58 --> 7978.58]  Amen.
[8006.58 --> 8008.58]  Amen.
[8036.58 --> 8038.58]  Amen.
[8066.58 --> 8068.58]  Amen.
