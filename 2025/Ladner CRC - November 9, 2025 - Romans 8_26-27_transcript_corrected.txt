[2644.38 → 2651.38] Okay.
[2651.38 → 2674.36] Okay.
[2674.36 → 2704.34] This is what you're,
[2704.36 → 2734.36] It's a beautiful picture.
[2734.36 → 2764.34] I see all the people,
[2764.36 → 2794.34] Yeah, yeah.
[2794.34 → 2824.34] We said,
[2824.34 → 2854.32] people from the people,
[2854.32 → 2884.30] We actually support,
[2884.30 → 2914.28] So, you know,
[2914.30 → 2944.28] All right, thank you,
[2944.28 → 2974.28] We'll turn, you know,
[2974.28 → 3004.26] two, and we're, you know,
[3004.26 → 3034.24] So, we'll be in, you know, we're in the I mean, we're in the, you know, we're in the, you know,
[3034.24 → 3064.24] And I'm in the, you know, we're in the, you know,
[3064.24 → 3071.46] in love. And we pray now that you would take our minds off of all of those things that distract
[3071.46 → 3077.96] so that we could spend this time with you. And we pray too, Lord, that your Holy Spirit would
[3077.96 → 3085.22] pour your love into our hearts, even as we listen now to your word. We ask for your strength,
[3085.74 → 3094.14] for your illumination, and all for your glory. And it's in the name of Jesus Christ that we pray.
[3094.66 → 3105.12] Amen. So we're looking at two short verses today, then we'll be two more weeks in Romans chapter 8,
[3105.12 → 3109.94] then we'll finish it up right before Advent, which is coming up. So today, then two more weeks in
[3109.94 → 3117.88] Romans 8. But today, what we have before us is these two verses where Paul speaks about prayer.
[3117.88 → 3127.34] prayer. We all know that prayer is a basic and important part of the Christian life. And yet,
[3128.14 → 3137.78] we find it to be one of the find it to be often one of the most confusing and frustrating parts of the
[3137.78 → 3145.86] Christian life. Right? Because we have all sorts of questions when it comes to prayer. Right? What
[3145.86 → 3156.18] should I pray for? Am I saying it right? Is my heart clean enough? Why doesn't God seem to hear? And if he
[3156.18 → 3163.26] is hearing, why doesn't he seem to answer? Right? Does prayer get God to change his mind? Or to change
[3163.26 → 3171.00] his plans? If not, why do we, does it, why do we, does it even matter that we do pray? Right? We have
[3171.00 → 3176.30] all these kinds of questions about prayer. And we have all these uncertainties when it comes to prayer.
[3177.12 → 3185.52] But the good news is that we have help in this area of prayer this morning because we have the help of
[3185.52 → 3192.70] the Holy Spirit. And friends, that is great help indeed, the help of the Holy Spirit. And that is what
[3192.70 → 3201.70] Romans 8, 26 and 27 is about. And so our outline this morning is very simple. First, Paul asks, and we're
[3201.70 → 3209.04] going to ask, why is prayer so hard? And then secondly, we're going to see how this Holy
[3209.04 → 3216.76] Spirit helps us to pray. Okay, why is prayer so hard? And how the Holy Spirit helps us. And so let's look at
[3216.76 → 3224.86] this first question, why is prayer so hard? Well, there is a reason. Okay, there's actually a reason
[3224.86 → 3231.64] why prayer is hard. So it's not just you. Okay, it's not just me. It's not just the experience of
[3231.64 → 3241.10] Christians who have even followed Christ for 60, 80 years. And that's a comfort at least. But Paul says
[3241.10 → 3248.52] this, it's because of our weakness. That's why prayer is hard. So let's see what it says in verse 26 of
[3248.52 → 3258.10] our passage. Paul says, in the same way, the Spirit helps us, how? In our weakness. So what does that
[3258.10 → 3266.02] mean? In what ways are we weak when it comes to prayer? Well, there are a couple of things we can think of.
[3266.02 → 3276.52] As we know from other places in Romans, one aspect of our weakness is our sin, right? Sin is often a barrier
[3276.52 → 3284.58] to prayer with God. Sometimes when we sin, we're conscious of our sins, we feel like we can't come to God.
[3284.94 → 3293.32] So there's a sense where we don't feel that closest with God our Father. And David said this, King David said
[3293.32 → 3300.84] this about his prayer life in Psalm 66. He said, if I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have
[3300.84 → 3308.72] listened. If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. So there's a sense that in which we cannot
[3308.72 → 3319.52] be cherishing sin, living sin, and at the same time, talking to God as if he is not bothered by that. Okay, so our sin can
[3319.52 → 3327.44] keep us from prayer. Now that does not mean that the Holy Spirit leaves us when we sin. Okay, the Holy Spirit
[3327.44 → 3335.20] never leaves you. The Holy Spirit always abides in us even when we sin. It's a miracle of God's grace.
[3336.42 → 3341.48] And the Holy Spirit helps us to put to death the deeds of the body, which is what it means to be led by
[3341.48 → 3349.00] the Spirit. Okay, so. But now there's another kind of weakness that hinders our prayers. And it's not
[3349.00 → 3355.42] just the spiritual weakness of sin, but it's actually our physical weakness. And so, you know, I think about
[3355.42 → 3362.86] that one time when Jesus was with his disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane. And Jesus wanted to
[3362.86 → 3369.66] kind of step aside and spend some time with God, his Father, in prayer. And he says to his disciples,
[3369.66 → 3381.90] stay awake and pray with me. But what happens? The disciples keep falling asleep, right? And so then
[3381.90 → 3390.32] Jesus even says to them, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is what? Weak. Have you ever experienced that?
[3391.02 → 3399.56] Getting up maybe early to pray, to, you know, read your Bible and then just nodding off, right? We know what
[3399.56 → 3405.56] it's like. It's so frustrating. The weakness of our bodies. And that hinders us in our prayers to God.
[3406.50 → 3412.04] So we have the weakness of our sin and of our bodies, but actually those are not what Paul is
[3412.04 → 3418.46] focusing on here. That's not what he has in mind. The weakness, the struggle we have here in Romans 8
[3418.46 → 3429.10] is our ignorance. It's our lack of understanding. So Paul says this still in verse 26. Do I have it on
[3429.10 → 3435.74] there? Okay. In the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness, namely, we do not know what we ought
[3435.74 → 3444.44] to pray for. We don't know. In our weakness and our human limitations, we simply don't know what to pray
[3444.44 → 3453.20] for or how to pray. So often we go to pray, and we're trying to articulate a prayer way in a situation
[3453.20 → 3460.90] that we need prayer for, and we become lost for words because we simply don't know what is best.
[3461.02 → 3468.60] What is best for us? What is best for others in a situation? How do you pray? And you've probably
[3468.60 → 3474.54] had this experience of not knowing how to pray in a situation. You know, maybe you're trying to decide
[3474.54 → 3480.76] whether to take a new job, right? There are clear benefits, maybe better salary, for instance,
[3481.12 → 3486.66] better working conditions, better support, whatever. But there are some drawbacks. Maybe it's a longer
[3486.66 → 3494.48] commute or longer hours. How should you pray? Should you pray that God will give you the job?
[3494.48 → 3501.44] You don't know. You don't know what is best. Or if we just don't know, maybe all of our prayers should
[3501.44 → 3510.24] simply be, thy will be done. That's fine. But I'm sure we would often like to pray with a bit more
[3510.24 → 3520.98] specificity, right? But often we just don't know how to pray. And notice here, what does Paul say?
[3520.98 → 3530.76] We do not know how to pray as we ought to. And we would say, you know, if there's anybody who knows
[3530.76 → 3538.78] the will of God, we would say it's likely the Apostle Paul. But even Paul had the same problem. It's
[3538.78 → 3545.36] something that we all face as part of our human condition. And so there's a time that Paul writes
[3545.36 → 3553.18] about in his own life when he was in prison in Philippi. Listen to what it says in Philippians
[3553.18 → 3556.16] chapter 1, verses 22 to 24. Paul writes this,
[3556.16 → 3586.14] Paul was perplexed on what to pray.
[3586.14 → 3592.14] I'd like to go home and be with the Lord. I'm suffering here. You know, maybe I've had it. I'm done.
[3593.82 → 3598.40] It would be a relief. But if I stay, I know it's going to be better for the churches. I'll be able
[3598.40 → 3605.68] to keep building them up. What shall I choose? I don't know. Paul didn't know what to pray.
[3607.02 → 3612.60] Another example comes from the life of John Bunyan. So John Bunyan was a Baptist minister,
[3612.60 → 3619.28] and he was imprisoned because of the Five-Mile Act. That was an act of Congress, British, sorry,
[3619.36 → 3625.16] British Parliament, that forbid non-conforming ministers to come within five miles of their
[3625.16 → 3631.42] home pulpits. Now, what this did was actually all the pastors went out into the small towns,
[3631.54 → 3635.18] into the fields, preached out in the open, and there was a great revival that happened.
[3635.18 → 3642.28] But for John Bunyan and many others, he actually was in jail for 12 years,
[3643.18 → 3650.04] mainly voluntarily, because he was unwilling to sign off that he would not preach.
[3651.18 → 3656.66] If he agreed to the ban, they would have let him out. He didn't have to stay in jail.
[3656.66 → 3665.66] But he refused, even though he had a wife and four children at home, including a blind daughter
[3665.66 → 3675.46] named Mary, who he'd wondered, how is she doing, you know, without him? Was it the right choice?
[3677.54 → 3682.10] It's hard to know, right? And John Bunyan, he wrestled with that.
[3682.10 → 3689.34] And so in prison, with just a few books and a pen, not only did he write The Pilgrim's Progress,
[3690.26 → 3695.64] but he wrote one of the greatest books about prayer ever written. And here's something that
[3695.64 → 3702.00] John Bunyan writes about his own weakness in prayer. He says this,
[3702.00 → 3710.90] May I but speak of my own experience. And from that tell you the difficulty of praying to God as I ought.
[3711.36 → 3717.74] Nay, many times I know not what to pray for. I am so blind, nor how to pray. I am so ignorant.
[3718.60 → 3724.26] Only the Spirit helps our infirmities. Citing Romans 8.26.
[3724.26 → 3735.30] And so that brings us to the second point. Enough of our troubles, right? But the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[3736.42 → 3740.44] And that's the second point. How does the Spirit help us in our prayers?
[3740.92 → 3744.36] Paul wants us to know that we have the help of the Holy Spirit.
[3744.36 → 3754.88] Right? And though we do not know often what to pray for, He, the Spirit, intercedes for us through wordless groans.
[3755.80 → 3759.40] Which is a fascinating image we'll talk about.
[3760.54 → 3765.50] So, you know, what we're seeing here is that we are weak, but He is strong.
[3766.10 → 3768.06] Right? That's the children's song, right? We love to sing that.
[3768.42 → 3770.22] We are weak, but He is strong.
[3770.22 → 3775.34] And that is just as true in our prayers as in any other part of the Christian life.
[3776.74 → 3780.38] So how then does the Spirit help us in our prayers?
[3780.72 → 3790.60] There are three keywords in these verses that I want to look at to give us some insight into how the Spirit helps us in our prayers.
[3791.36 → 3794.22] I'm really sorry. I'm going to have to grab a drink because I've been a little bit sick.
[3800.22 → 3810.62] My sermon is loaded this week.
[3811.66 → 3813.24] But I needed coffee.
[3814.18 → 3820.98] Okay, so three words that give us some insight into how this Holy Spirit helps us in prayer.
[3820.98 → 3826.88] And the first word that we have is that word help in verse 26.
[3827.16 → 3827.90] Okay, let's look again.
[3827.90 → 3832.04] In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[3832.48 → 3834.38] Now, that seems simple enough.
[3834.56 → 3835.52] The Holy Spirit helps us.
[3836.22 → 3842.66] But the English word helps doesn't really do justice to the word.
[3843.32 → 3847.36] Okay, the Greek word that Paul uses is a really long word.
[3848.12 → 3850.28] And there's much more to it than just helps.
[3850.78 → 3853.26] Okay, it's a word that is made up of three parts.
[3853.78 → 3856.58] And all together, this is what it is.
[3856.58 → 3862.00] It's a person who comes alongside to help carry a burden.
[3862.74 → 3863.88] All that in one word.
[3864.20 → 3868.12] Someone who comes alongside to help carry a burden.
[3869.08 → 3872.36] That's what that word helps is conveying.
[3872.36 → 3877.34] You know, it's actually very similar to the way Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit.
[3877.34 → 3878.02] Right?
[3878.14 → 3882.10] Jesus calls the Holy Spirit a Paraclete.
[3882.52 → 3887.86] Which means the one who is called alongside of another to help.
[3888.32 → 3891.46] It's where we translate it sometimes as an advocate.
[3891.46 → 3894.06] Which has a similar meaning, an advocate.
[3895.06 → 3901.98] And so the picture here is of having this heavy burden of needing to pray about a situation.
[3902.14 → 3906.66] You know, when we have a need to pray, we feel burdened, right?
[3906.68 → 3909.66] When we say that language, I'm burdened to pray for something.
[3909.66 → 3914.78] You know, and maybe it's a hard situation that we're in, that we're facing.
[3915.50 → 3917.70] But we don't know what to pray.
[3917.96 → 3922.10] And we're struggling under the burden, as it were.
[3922.76 → 3924.02] And so what does the Holy Spirit do?
[3924.12 → 3926.10] The Holy Spirit comes alongside.
[3926.76 → 3929.28] He identifies with us in our weakness.
[3929.68 → 3932.32] And he helps to carry that burden.
[3933.22 → 3935.74] That is the help that the Holy Spirit gives us.
[3935.74 → 3940.38] He joins us in the burden of prayer.
[3940.70 → 3941.84] And he helps us.
[3941.90 → 3942.82] He carries it with us.
[3942.90 → 3943.86] Okay, that's the first word.
[3944.26 → 3950.50] The second word that Paul uses to describe the Holy Spirit's help in prayer is the word intercedes.
[3951.50 → 3954.16] And we see that word actually twice in our passage.
[3954.80 → 3957.44] So at the end of verse 26 into verse 27,
[3958.16 → 3963.96] the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
[3963.96 → 3969.34] And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit,
[3969.58 → 3974.66] because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God.
[3978.06 → 3982.82] Did you know that in Romans we have two intercessors?
[3984.30 → 3987.12] Okay, we have Jesus Christ in verse 34,
[3987.62 → 3991.36] enthroned in heaven, seated at the right hand of God,
[3991.36 → 3996.12] who as it were points to his wounds in answer to our every sin.
[3997.74 → 4001.48] And we have the Holy Spirit enthroned in our hearts,
[4001.66 → 4003.94] who intercedes for us,
[4004.10 → 4008.34] who prays to God for us in accordance with the will of God.
[4008.34 → 4013.60] And that is exactly the help we need in prayer, isn't it?
[4014.52 → 4017.86] For the Holy Spirit to come and to pray according to the will of God.
[4017.94 → 4019.38] That is the help we need,
[4019.48 → 4021.56] because that's just what we are weak in.
[4022.50 → 4022.74] Right?
[4022.80 → 4024.96] We don't know what to pray as we ought,
[4025.04 → 4027.14] because we don't know what God's will is.
[4027.54 → 4031.64] We are so limited in our understanding as human beings.
[4031.64 → 4034.66] We don't know what God intends to do in any situation,
[4035.32 → 4037.52] but the Holy Spirit knows.
[4038.64 → 4040.00] So who is the Holy Spirit?
[4040.70 → 4044.18] The Holy Spirit is God himself,
[4044.30 → 4045.48] the third person of the Trinity,
[4045.84 → 4047.50] Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[4047.98 → 4050.92] The Holy Spirit knows perfectly the will of God,
[4051.02 → 4052.32] because he is God.
[4053.06 → 4057.38] And that's why he can intercede for us according to the will of God.
[4057.38 → 4063.80] And there's no way that that prayer is not going to be heard or answered.
[4065.44 → 4070.32] And this is how we can know that our prayers to God are effective.
[4071.24 → 4071.70] Right?
[4071.78 → 4074.38] Because the Holy Spirit is interceding for us,
[4074.46 → 4077.56] taking our prayers and praying to God in such a way
[4077.56 → 4081.34] that we would have prayed if we knew everything that God knows.
[4083.68 → 4087.08] And so let's look at one verse that will kind of anchor this for us, I hope.
[4087.08 → 4089.80] It's 1 John 5, verse 14.
[4090.70 → 4092.00] This is what it says.
[4092.50 → 4095.26] This is the confidence we have in approaching God,
[4095.46 → 4099.50] that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
[4101.86 → 4105.32] And that means, obviously, that there are prayers which we,
[4105.64 → 4108.08] even as Christians, say to God,
[4108.20 → 4110.24] which are not part of God's will for us,
[4110.38 → 4111.50] and so will not be answered.
[4113.08 → 4115.84] And this is the same, I suppose, with any natural family.
[4117.08 → 4117.32] Right?
[4117.44 → 4121.08] Children come and ask their parents for the craziest things.
[4122.30 → 4123.54] And parents, what do they do?
[4124.18 → 4125.56] They receive those requests,
[4125.96 → 4127.86] but they don't always grant them.
[4127.96 → 4130.80] You can't just grant every request a kid makes.
[4131.02 → 4132.06] You know, that's not good for them.
[4132.06 → 4134.18] So what does the parent do?
[4134.26 → 4135.90] They receive the request, say, thank you.
[4136.02 → 4137.96] Now, you know, run on your way.
[4138.94 → 4140.80] And that request just kind of gets tucked away.
[4142.36 → 4145.46] Many requests are made by children to parents which cannot be given.
[4145.46 → 4149.32] And we also will pray to our Heavenly Father and say,
[4149.42 → 4150.98] Lord, I need this, I need that.
[4151.40 → 4153.16] And we bring our request before him.
[4154.04 → 4156.12] And then we're wondering, well, what's going on?
[4156.18 → 4158.08] I prayed that God would do this way,
[4158.16 → 4159.66] but God has done it that way.
[4161.10 → 4164.00] But we can actually take heart and rest assured
[4164.00 → 4168.66] that the Holy Spirit's intercessions have been answered.
[4168.66 → 4172.32] That God has done according to his will
[4172.32 → 4173.98] through the prayer of the Holy Spirit.
[4175.18 → 4175.44] Right?
[4175.50 → 4177.48] Because it's impossible that the Holy Spirit
[4177.48 → 4178.52] would pray to the Father
[4178.52 → 4181.80] for anything other than what is according to the will of God.
[4182.76 → 4186.92] And we know that what God does
[4186.92 → 4188.14] is according to his own will.
[4188.90 → 4192.18] So we've seen that the Holy Spirit then helps us.
[4192.36 → 4195.24] He comes and takes our burdens of prayer.
[4195.62 → 4196.60] He helps carry them.
[4196.60 → 4199.40] Then he interprets those prayers.
[4199.58 → 4201.46] He intercedes and prays to God
[4201.46 → 4202.76] according to the will of God.
[4203.78 → 4205.98] Then the third and final word
[4205.98 → 4209.00] that describes how the Spirit helps us
[4209.00 → 4213.86] is that word groan that we see again in verse 26.
[4214.44 → 4216.46] The Spirit himself intercedes for us
[4216.46 → 4219.06] through wordless groans.
[4220.36 → 4221.70] What does that mean?
[4223.08 → 4225.50] Commentators have different views on this.
[4225.50 → 4226.30] Some of them will say,
[4226.60 → 4227.62] we don't know.
[4229.00 → 4231.08] Others have some opinions,
[4231.50 → 4235.06] but here's what we can first say is not the case.
[4235.36 → 4239.22] It is not talking about praying in other tongues.
[4240.16 → 4243.58] This is not a special prayer language given to some.
[4243.98 → 4246.26] It is wordless groans.
[4246.52 → 4247.50] It's unspoken.
[4247.50 → 4251.46] It is talking about the Holy Spirit groaning,
[4251.46 → 4252.16] not use.
[4252.16 → 4255.62] Okay, so, but the question remains,
[4256.16 → 4259.52] why would the Holy Spirit groan?
[4259.52 → 4264.92] Well, remember this idea of how God helps us,
[4264.92 → 4266.02] how the Holy Spirit helps us.
[4266.06 → 4268.26] He comes, and he helps us carry our burdens.
[4269.42 → 4270.42] So if you think,
[4270.52 → 4272.24] if you have that picture in mind,
[4272.52 → 4275.30] the Holy Spirit helping carry a burden
[4275.30 → 4276.24] and groaning,
[4276.80 → 4278.44] that actually makes a lot of sense.
[4278.44 → 4279.92] You know,
[4279.92 → 4282.08] so a couple of years ago,
[4282.22 → 4283.92] when my family moved into the house
[4283.92 → 4284.76] that we're now renting,
[4285.46 → 4287.50] a few of the guys from the church here
[4287.50 → 4288.44] came and helped us.
[4289.24 → 4292.12] And you know the thing I saved for the end,
[4292.22 → 4293.60] the last thing to move?
[4293.60 → 4296.90] Ryan remembers.
[4298.34 → 4299.48] So we moved the piano.
[4299.76 → 4302.46] Now, moving a piano is not fun.
[4303.40 → 4304.46] Those things are heavy
[4304.46 → 4306.40] and a real pain to move.
[4307.04 → 4309.68] So what is the appropriate expression
[4309.68 → 4311.70] when you're carrying a piano
[4311.70 → 4313.00] up a flight of stairs?
[4314.90 → 4316.48] Groan, right?
[4316.74 → 4320.20] It's not a long-winded explanation of,
[4320.50 → 4320.66] you know,
[4320.70 → 4321.48] we really should have hired
[4321.48 → 4322.50] a professional moving company
[4322.50 → 4323.18] to move this piano.
[4323.60 → 4324.36] You know,
[4324.40 → 4326.90] if someone is helping you say that,
[4327.12 → 4327.78] you would say,
[4328.34 → 4330.78] shut it and carry.
[4331.82 → 4332.90] Groan with us, right?
[4332.96 → 4333.60] And so we're carrying,
[4333.80 → 4336.86] if the Spirit is going to be a helpful helper
[4336.86 → 4338.22] in our prayers,
[4338.42 → 4339.34] He's going to groan.
[4340.82 → 4342.40] He bears our burdens.
[4343.24 → 4344.72] And it's so interesting
[4344.72 → 4345.64] that this word groans,
[4345.80 → 4345.92] you know,
[4345.96 → 4346.80] this is the third time
[4346.80 → 4348.44] we've seen that word in Romans 8.
[4349.02 → 4350.70] The first time was creation.
[4350.70 → 4352.74] Creation itself groans
[4352.74 → 4354.84] groans to be set free
[4354.84 → 4356.70] from its bondage to corruption.
[4357.46 → 4358.04] And then it says,
[4358.26 → 4359.36] we as Christians
[4359.36 → 4361.24] groan inwardly
[4361.24 → 4362.74] as we eagerly await
[4362.74 → 4364.72] the resurrection of our bodies.
[4365.38 → 4366.66] So creation groans,
[4367.04 → 4367.94] we groan,
[4368.12 → 4369.54] and now the Holy Spirit groans.
[4369.54 → 4372.88] And so what we see is that part of the ministry
[4372.88 → 4373.70] of the Holy Spirit
[4373.70 → 4377.14] is that it enters into the groans of creation,
[4377.48 → 4379.42] into the groans of His church,
[4379.42 → 4382.64] and He carries those burdens with us.
[4382.64 → 4386.92] And there are no words for these groans, right?
[4386.96 → 4389.16] Because some of the yearnings of our heart
[4389.16 → 4391.10] are just too deep.
[4392.28 → 4394.30] That words cannot even get beneath them.
[4395.82 → 4398.90] And the only thing that we can lift them up to God with
[4398.90 → 4402.44] is groans, right?
[4402.48 → 4403.36] And sometimes in prayer,
[4403.48 → 4405.10] that's all we can offer to God
[4405.10 → 4406.52] is a deep groan.
[4406.52 → 4408.88] And that's okay.
[4409.92 → 4411.32] Some of us have experienced
[4411.32 → 4413.54] what it is to groan.
[4414.10 → 4415.04] And if you are young,
[4415.56 → 4416.64] you will.
[4418.52 → 4419.80] Some of us know
[4419.80 → 4421.26] what it is to groan
[4421.26 → 4422.94] for our children.
[4424.20 → 4425.92] To feel so much on the inside
[4425.92 → 4426.94] that all we can do
[4426.94 → 4428.72] to lift them up before God
[4428.72 → 4429.70] is to groan.
[4431.02 → 4432.72] The world is full
[4432.72 → 4433.88] of parents groaning
[4433.88 → 4434.78] for their children.
[4434.78 → 4437.10] It is full of friends
[4437.10 → 4438.96] groaning for one another.
[4439.74 → 4440.82] And of spouses
[4440.82 → 4443.38] groaning for one another.
[4444.20 → 4445.12] And of children
[4445.12 → 4446.18] groaning for their parents.
[4446.24 → 4447.24] And the world is full
[4447.24 → 4448.12] of groans.
[4449.48 → 4451.20] And here's the amazing thing,
[4451.40 → 4452.28] which is that God
[4452.28 → 4453.46] groans too.
[4454.16 → 4455.10] God, not because
[4455.10 → 4457.02] He has any lack or need,
[4457.14 → 4458.58] but He shares
[4458.58 → 4459.42] in the groans
[4459.42 → 4460.18] of His creation
[4460.18 → 4460.90] and His people.
[4461.60 → 4462.66] We have been adopted
[4462.66 → 4464.10] as sons and daughters of God
[4464.10 → 4464.92] and the Holy Spirit
[4464.92 → 4466.38] whom God has poured out
[4466.38 → 4467.36] into our hearts,
[4467.70 → 4468.64] takes our groans
[4468.64 → 4470.22] and intercedes
[4470.22 → 4471.24] for us
[4471.24 → 4472.54] before our Heavenly Father.
[4473.68 → 4475.60] God hears our groans.
[4476.62 → 4477.40] He knows
[4477.40 → 4478.38] just what is on
[4478.38 → 4479.30] our hearts
[4479.30 → 4479.94] because
[4479.94 → 4480.98] Paul says here
[4480.98 → 4481.78] in verse 27,
[4482.18 → 4483.44] God is the searcher
[4483.44 → 4484.28] of our hearts.
[4484.78 → 4485.40] It's a beautiful
[4485.40 → 4487.14] image of who God is,
[4487.18 → 4487.76] the searcher
[4487.76 → 4488.40] of our hearts.
[4488.98 → 4489.94] He knows
[4489.94 → 4491.62] those things
[4491.62 → 4492.18] in our hearts
[4492.18 → 4492.84] that words cannot
[4492.84 → 4493.62] even express.
[4495.68 → 4496.42] And if you've ever
[4496.42 → 4497.50] visited a home
[4497.50 → 4498.34] where there's a mother
[4498.34 → 4498.90] and a father
[4498.90 → 4499.82] and a young child,
[4500.00 → 4500.74] you've kind of seen
[4500.74 → 4501.38] how this works.
[4502.24 → 4503.20] So you have a toddler,
[4503.36 → 4503.56] right?
[4504.34 → 4505.60] And, you know,
[4505.64 → 4506.22] little children,
[4506.40 → 4506.76] toddlers,
[4506.92 → 4508.12] they say things
[4508.12 → 4508.94] that nobody
[4508.94 → 4509.86] but the parent
[4509.86 → 4510.72] understands.
[4511.54 → 4512.32] So the child
[4512.32 → 4513.16] will start saying,
[4513.86 → 4514.50] the, the.
[4515.56 → 4516.18] And the visitor,
[4516.30 → 4516.76] if you're a visitor,
[4516.86 → 4517.24] you might come,
[4517.36 → 4518.68] oh, you know,
[4519.00 → 4519.96] she wants her dad.
[4519.96 → 4522.14] And the dad's like,
[4522.40 → 4523.34] no, she wants her blanket.
[4524.30 → 4524.62] And you're like,
[4524.66 → 4526.36] how did you get that?
[4526.98 → 4528.06] Well, the parent knows,
[4528.12 → 4528.32] right?
[4529.40 → 4531.02] Parents know,
[4531.10 → 4531.94] they understand
[4531.94 → 4532.74] the babble
[4532.74 → 4533.92] of their children.
[4534.54 → 4535.82] And in the same way,
[4535.98 → 4537.18] the heavenly father
[4537.18 → 4538.08] understands
[4538.08 → 4538.76] the groans
[4538.76 → 4540.16] of his children.
[4541.62 → 4542.50] So my question
[4542.50 → 4542.92] for you,
[4542.98 → 4543.38] I guess,
[4543.42 → 4544.38] this morning is,
[4544.86 → 4546.04] do you have
[4546.04 → 4546.76] an intercessor?
[4549.02 → 4549.20] Right?
[4549.20 → 4549.96] Do you have somebody
[4549.96 → 4551.30] who sits at the right hand
[4551.30 → 4552.38] of the Father in heaven?
[4552.60 → 4553.48] Right this minute,
[4554.26 → 4554.96] Jesus Christ,
[4555.04 → 4555.92] the righteous one,
[4556.00 → 4557.16] who makes intercession
[4557.16 → 4557.70] for you.
[4558.96 → 4560.72] And it is his Holy Spirit
[4560.72 → 4562.02] in you,
[4563.18 → 4565.66] bearing your prayer burdens,
[4566.14 → 4567.80] interceding for the Father,
[4568.38 → 4569.04] and groaning
[4569.04 → 4571.06] in prayers
[4571.06 → 4573.04] that words cannot express.
[4573.56 → 4573.78] Friends,
[4573.84 → 4574.76] you don't have to bear
[4574.76 → 4575.88] your weakness alone.
[4576.68 → 4577.82] You can pray to Jesus.
[4577.82 → 4578.94] You can pray,
[4579.00 → 4580.06] you can accept him today,
[4580.46 → 4581.70] and the Holy Spirit
[4581.70 → 4582.28] will help you.
[4583.10 → 4583.84] So let's bow
[4583.84 → 4584.56] in prayer together.
[4589.76 → 4590.48] Our God
[4590.48 → 4591.30] and our Heavenly Father,
[4591.38 → 4591.94] we thank you
[4591.94 → 4592.66] for these verses.
[4593.40 → 4594.42] They're not easy
[4594.42 → 4595.20] to understand.
[4595.38 → 4596.08] This is way
[4596.08 → 4597.46] beyond our pay grade.
[4598.66 → 4599.48] But thank you,
[4599.56 → 4599.64] Lord,
[4599.68 → 4600.44] for the truth
[4600.44 → 4602.44] that we can know,
[4602.54 → 4602.86] which is that
[4602.86 → 4603.54] the Holy Spirit
[4603.54 → 4604.94] intercedes for us
[4604.94 → 4605.52] with groans
[4605.52 → 4606.24] that are too deep
[4606.24 → 4606.74] for words.
[4607.80 → 4608.32] Thank you,
[4608.44 → 4608.56] Father,
[4608.68 → 4609.82] that we can cast
[4609.82 → 4610.76] all of our cares
[4610.76 → 4611.40] upon you
[4611.40 → 4613.02] because you care for us.
[4613.76 → 4614.40] And Father,
[4614.48 → 4615.54] for those here this morning
[4615.54 → 4616.32] who groan
[4616.32 → 4616.90] under the burden
[4616.90 → 4617.48] of sin
[4617.48 → 4620.48] and who do not yet know
[4620.48 → 4621.56] your forgiveness,
[4621.84 → 4621.96] Lord,
[4622.00 → 4623.50] we pray that their groanings
[4623.50 → 4624.56] would drive them to you,
[4625.72 → 4626.70] that you would accept,
[4627.28 → 4628.10] and that they would accept
[4628.10 → 4629.08] your invitation
[4629.08 → 4630.16] when you say,
[4630.50 → 4631.24] come unto me,
[4631.30 → 4632.26] all who are weary
[4632.26 → 4633.36] and heavy laden,
[4633.90 → 4635.78] and I will give you rest.
[4635.88 → 4637.06] Take my yoke upon you
[4637.06 → 4637.92] and learn from me,
[4638.34 → 4639.04] for I am weak
[4639.04 → 4640.06] and lowly in heart,
[4640.14 → 4641.04] and you shall find
[4641.04 → 4642.08] rest for your souls.
[4644.76 → 4645.60] We thank you,
[4645.70 → 4645.86] Lord,
[4645.94 → 4647.06] that all of us
[4647.06 → 4648.42] can cast our burdens
[4648.42 → 4650.06] and to take
[4650.06 → 4651.12] your easy yoke
[4651.12 → 4652.30] upon us,
[4652.88 → 4654.74] and that you carry
[4654.74 → 4655.88] those burdens with us.
[4656.42 → 4656.70] And Lord,
[4656.74 → 4657.26] we thank you
[4657.26 → 4658.28] and we ask all
[4658.28 → 4659.02] in Jesus' name.
[4659.54 → 4659.84] Amen.
[4659.84 → 4659.94] Amen.
[4662.26 → 4663.82] All right.
[4664.00 → 4664.18] So,
[4664.42 → 4665.26] let's all stand
[4665.26 → 4665.80] and let's sing
[4665.80 → 4666.88] our song of response together.
[4666.88 → 4667.04] Amen.
[4692.26 → 4694.26] Holy Spirit,
[4694.26 → 4697.84] living breath of God,
[4698.26 → 4699.94] breathe your life
[4699.94 → 4702.60] into my will,
[4702.72 → 4704.38] so Lord.
[4705.68 → 4708.48] Let the presence
[4708.48 → 4711.88] of the risen Lord
[4711.88 → 4715.20] come in my heart
[4715.20 → 4717.56] and make me whole.
[4717.56 → 4721.98] cause your word
[4721.98 → 4723.56] to come alive
[4723.56 → 4725.56] in me.
[4725.56 → 4728.80] Give me faith
[4728.80 → 4732.72] for what I cannot see.
[4733.30 → 4735.90] Give me passion
[4735.90 → 4738.78] for your purity.
[4739.56 → 4741.72] Holy Spirit,
[4742.30 → 4745.30] breathe your life in me.
[4745.30 → 4749.92] Holy Spirit,
[4749.92 → 4753.30] come abide with me.
[4753.30 → 4756.68] May your joy be seen
[4756.68 → 4759.30] in all I do.
[4761.04 → 4764.54] Love enough to cover
[4764.54 → 4767.00] every sin
[4767.00 → 4770.42] in his blood and deed
[4770.42 → 4772.04] and attitude.
[4775.04 → 4778.38] Kindness to the greatest
[4778.38 → 4781.22] and the least.
[4782.92 → 4785.04] Gentleness that soars
[4785.04 → 4788.40] the path of peace.
[4788.98 → 4791.26] Turn my study
[4791.26 → 4794.70] to works of grace,
[4795.06 → 4797.22] breath of God's soul,
[4797.22 → 4800.22] Christ in all I do.
[4802.22 → 4805.22] Holy Spirit,
[4805.22 → 4808.22] from creation's birth,
[4808.22 → 4812.18] giving life to all
[4812.18 → 4815.22] that God has made.
[4815.22 → 4819.18] show your power
[4819.18 → 4822.60] once again on earth.
[4822.92 → 4824.62] Cause your church
[4824.62 → 4829.22] to hunger for your ways.
[4830.22 → 4833.22] Let the fragrance
[4833.22 → 4836.22] of our faith arise.
[4837.22 → 4840.68] Lead us on the world
[4840.68 → 4843.68] of sacrifice.
[4844.68 → 4846.68] That in unity
[4847.30 → 4848.68] that face
[4848.68 → 4849.68] of Christ
[4850.36 → 4851.60] may be
[4851.60 → 4852.68] faithful
[4852.68 → 4854.98] for the world
[4854.98 → 4855.76] to see.
[4858.68 → 4859.98] Let me be seated.
[4859.98 → 4870.14] So this is the time
[4870.14 → 4871.44] in our service
[4871.44 → 4872.50] when we get to respond
[4872.50 → 4874.02] to God's rich mercy
[4874.02 → 4875.88] with our tithes
[4875.88 → 4876.54] and our offerings.
[4877.50 → 4879.28] And our designated offering today
[4879.28 → 4880.68] on the offering schedule
[4880.68 → 4882.86] is Meals on Wheels,
[4883.14 → 4883.74] South Delta.
[4883.74 → 4887.96] and so may I just invite
[4887.96 → 4888.62] now the deacons
[4888.62 → 4889.24] to come forward
[4889.24 → 4890.46] to pass the offering bags.
[4890.46 → 4892.46] to pass the offering
[4892.46 → 4893.46] to us.

[4975.46 → 5005.44] Thank you.
[5005.46 → 5035.44] Thank you.
[5035.46 → 5037.46] Thank you.
[5037.46 → 5043.60] So let's turn our hearts together to the Lord in prayer.
[5043.60 → 5045.94] Please pray with me.
[5045.94 → 5054.94] Our Heavenly Father, Lord, we pray over our world.
[5055.84 → 5066.26] As wars rage, and the order that many of us have trusted in seems to be breaking, Lord, forgive us our distress.
[5066.26 → 5072.72] Because it is not in the power of nations that we rest, but only in your power.
[5073.60 → 5077.60] And we lift our eyes to the hills, you know, looking around for where our help would come.
[5077.60 → 5080.56] And where does our help come from?
[5080.64 → 5087.54] It comes not from economies, not from the power of militaries or political parties.
[5087.94 → 5090.40] It does not come from having popularity.
[5091.40 → 5100.84] It does not come from personal prosperity or technology or any of the thousand blessings that your hand has given us in our day.
[5100.84 → 5105.24] But our help, Father, comes from you alone, the maker of heaven and earth.
[5106.52 → 5109.00] And these other things rise and fall by your will.
[5110.06 → 5116.52] So may it be, Lord, that your people will not cease to sing your praise as our world heaves and groans.
[5116.52 → 5123.52] May we stand out among the peoples as people of joy and hope and of love.
[5124.80 → 5135.48] Not because we are ignorant of the sufferings and the fears of the world, but because of our hope in you that is stronger than any fear that might be thrust upon us.
[5135.48 → 5146.88] And may our faith, Lord, and may your Holy Spirit shine brighter within us as the days are dark and as winter comes.
[5148.00 → 5151.02] Lord, be with the leaders of the nations.
[5151.32 → 5160.20] And may your spirit and your people be active here and around the world, advocating for the vulnerable and the poor and the forgotten.
[5161.42 → 5164.06] Father, be with the leaders of our nation here in Canada.
[5164.06 → 5168.70] May they be seeking justice and loving mercy and walking humbly with you.
[5170.76 → 5174.12] And, Lord, may our nation be blessed.
[5174.74 → 5176.42] May it prosper by your grace.
[5177.18 → 5179.46] May you pave over the divisions of our country.
[5180.16 → 5185.34] For you have called us to pray over this land in which we find ourselves.
[5186.26 → 5193.60] Finding ourselves at once, both citizens and yet as strangers and exiles, whose citizenship is in heaven.
[5194.06 → 5202.22] And here, Father, in our church, would you look with favour upon your children here at Latter-Mercy.
[5202.70 → 5204.80] Lord, stretch your hand out over us.
[5205.94 → 5208.80] Enkindle within us a fire that will not dim.
[5210.04 → 5211.24] Cast out our doubts.
[5212.40 → 5215.72] Bind us to yourself and in unity with each other.
[5215.72 → 5223.12] Thank you, Father, for these brothers and sisters that we can sit beside here today.
[5224.64 → 5230.62] And, Lord, over the sick in our church, we ask for your healing power and your gentle presence.
[5231.26 → 5234.46] We especially pray for Mel as he recovers from his surgery.
[5234.46 → 5241.34] And we continue to pray for Shirley, as she still is often quite unsteady on her feet.
[5242.70 → 5249.12] And, Lord, we pray over students in our church and all those who labour in jobs.
[5249.74 → 5254.76] We ask, Lord, for energy and dedication to the work that you have called us to.
[5254.76 → 5260.12] And alongside the discouraged and the depressed, we look to you for hope and encouragement.
[5260.90 → 5266.60] Father, give to your church the unshakeable assurance that your throne is permanent
[5266.60 → 5271.20] and that we, as your children, dwell safely and securely in your love.
[5272.16 → 5275.64] And we pray all these things in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[5276.26 → 5276.60] Amen.
[5276.60 → 5276.68] Amen.
[5277.88 → 5278.82] Let's all stand.
[5280.04 → 5282.64] And we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[5283.00 → 5284.30] Join us for lunch.
[5285.06 → 5286.14] Soup and buns.
[5286.26 → 5289.52] It's always fun to see what delicious soups we're going to enjoy.
[5290.60 → 5295.34] And do consider whether you want to join the choir, adult choir, children's choir.
[5296.22 → 5298.70] And so we'll go out with God's blessings.
[5298.80 → 5302.62] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5302.62 → 5311.02] Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling, to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy,
[5311.42 → 5321.20] to the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages now and forevermore.
[5321.64 → 5321.96] Amen.
[5323.46 → 5326.96] Please remain standing, and we'll sing our final song together.
[5326.96 → 5341.76] By your grace we've been saved, born again to life.
[5342.66 → 5348.50] Joined by faith, one in heart, for your glory, Lord.
[5349.60 → 5352.38] Grant us peace and unity.
[5353.38 → 5355.96] Fill us now, we pray.
[5355.96 → 5360.04] Hand in hand with souls and three.
[5360.72 → 5363.56] Mind us, Lord, and use us, Lord.
[5363.88 → 5366.42] We'll lift us, Lord, today.
[5369.42 → 5375.96] By your grace we've been saved, born again to life.
[5376.84 → 5379.96] Glory by faith, born again to life.
[5379.96 → 5382.96] For your glory, Lord.
[5382.96 → 5386.32] Lord, let us be used, Trinity.
[5387.44 → 5389.78] Fill us now, we pray.
[5390.94 → 5394.06] Hand in hand with souls and three.
[5394.80 → 5397.68] Mind us, Lord, and use us, Lord.
[5397.68 → 5401.26] Hear us, Lord, today.
