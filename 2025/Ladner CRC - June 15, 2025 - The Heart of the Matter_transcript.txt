[299.98 --> 329.96]  Thank you.
[329.96 --> 359.94]  Thank you.
[359.94 --> 389.92]  Thank you.
[389.92 --> 419.90]  Thank you.
[420.20 --> 426.78]  Heavenly Father, you have created all things good and gifted us with a home full of beauty
[426.78 --> 427.90]  and resources.
[427.90 --> 437.74]  You have made us in your image with an ability to love, to co-create with you and care for
[437.74 --> 438.74]  this earth.
[438.74 --> 445.74]  Jesus, you have brought us in your life and you have a vision of the Father.
[445.74 --> 447.74]  And you have made us in your life.
[447.74 --> 449.74]  Thank you.
[449.74 --> 456.12]  Holy Spirit, you comfort us, guide us, and soften our hearts of stone.
[457.02 --> 461.42]  You are altogether good and just, majestic and holy.
[462.26 --> 466.62]  We worship and adore you, triune God. Amen.
[468.20 --> 473.78]  I would ask you if you're able to rise and to hear these words of greeting from God
[473.78 --> 476.98]  from Ephesians 1, verse 2.
[476.98 --> 482.98]  Grace to us and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[483.60 --> 488.04]  And as God has greeted us, take a moment to turn and greet some people around you.
[506.98 --> 508.98]  Amen.
[508.98 --> 509.98]  Amen.
[520.32 --> 522.44]  Amen.
[522.50 --> 523.54]  Amen.
[523.54 --> 524.94]  Amen.
[524.94 --> 554.92]  Thank you.
[554.94 --> 584.92]  Thank you.
[584.94 --> 614.92]  Thank you.
[614.94 --> 616.94]  Thank you.
[644.94 --> 646.94]  Thank you.
[646.94 --> 648.94]  Thank you.
[648.94 --> 650.94]  Thank you.
[650.94 --> 652.94]  Thank you.
[652.94 --> 654.94]  Thank you.
[654.94 --> 656.94]  Thank you.
[656.94 --> 658.94]  Thank you.
[658.94 --> 660.94]  Thank you.
[660.94 --> 662.94]  Thank you.
[662.94 --> 664.94]  Thank you.
[664.94 --> 666.94]  Thank you.
[666.94 --> 668.94]  Thank you.
[668.94 --> 674.04]  This morning, I forgot to mention and do a shout-out to all the dads here today.
[674.24 --> 681.42]  It's Father's Day, and we remember our fathers who had and still have so much influence on
[681.42 --> 682.00]  our lives.
[682.00 --> 683.28]  We thank God for them.
[683.84 --> 691.36]  And so as we sing this next song, we think about who God is as our Father
[691.36 --> 698.52]  and how he has given us fathers who teach their children well in his ways.
[712.00 --> 714.00]  Amen.
[742.00 --> 744.00]  Amen.
[772.00 --> 774.00]  Amen.
[802.00 --> 804.00]  Amen.
[832.00 --> 856.90]  You may be seated.
[862.00 --> 884.26]  Blessed the one who does no walk in the steps with the wicked or stand in the way, that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.
[884.26 --> 894.88]  That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither.
[894.88 --> 907.24]  Whatever they do prosper, not so the wicked. They are like chaff that the wine blows away.
[907.24 --> 915.30]  Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgments, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[916.66 --> 923.98]  For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
[923.98 --> 937.48]  Psalm 1 contrasts the wicked and the righteous.
[938.10 --> 946.52]  As followers of Christ, if we're honest, we will admit with Paul that the good we want to do, we don't.
[947.26 --> 952.14]  And the things we don't want to do, sometimes that's exactly where we end up.
[952.14 --> 957.78]  We are still so far from living the way Jesus modeled for us.
[958.50 --> 961.04]  This is what we confess together today.
[961.58 --> 965.22]  Please join me in this prayer of response.
[967.22 --> 970.98]  Lord, you come to us, but we do not recognize you.
[971.80 --> 974.48]  You call, but we do not follow.
[975.52 --> 978.36]  You command, but we do not obey.
[978.36 --> 982.62]  You bless us, but we do not thank you.
[983.78 --> 986.52]  Please forgive and help us.
[987.80 --> 991.88]  Lord, you accept us, but we do not accept others.
[992.64 --> 997.00]  You forgive us, but we do not forgive those who wrong us.
[997.72 --> 1001.36]  You love us, but we do not love our neighbors.
[1002.88 --> 1005.30]  Please forgive and help us.
[1005.30 --> 1013.22]  Lord, you showed us how to carry out your mission, but we still insist on our own.
[1014.12 --> 1022.30]  You identified yourself with outcasts, the needy and the poor, but we do not bother to find out what is happening to them.
[1023.30 --> 1028.64]  You suffered and died for the sake of all, but we do not give up our comfortable lives.
[1028.64 --> 1032.30]  Please forgive and help us.
[1032.62 --> 1035.00]  Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1035.26 --> 1035.86]  Amen.
[1038.02 --> 1046.74]  If we are sincere in our prayer for forgiveness and help, we have already become righteous through the work of Jesus Christ.
[1047.60 --> 1051.38]  Romans 8, verse 1 gives us this wonderful promise.
[1051.38 --> 1071.08]  If you are able and comfortable standing for the next two songs, please do so.
[1071.08 --> 1071.16]  Amen.
[1071.16 --> 1073.16]  Amen.
[1073.16 --> 1075.16]  Amen.
[1075.16 --> 1077.16]  Amen.
[1077.16 --> 1079.16]  Amen.
[1079.16 --> 1079.22]  Amen.
[1079.22 --> 1079.30]  Amen.
[1079.30 --> 1079.38]  Amen.
[1079.38 --> 1080.38]  Amen.
[1080.38 --> 1081.36]  Amen.
[1081.36 --> 1111.34]  Amen.
