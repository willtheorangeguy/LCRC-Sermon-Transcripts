[0.00 --> 29.98]  Let's pray.
[30.00 --> 32.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 329.98]  Amen.
[330.00 --> 335.10]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church on what's looking like a beautiful day today.
[335.48 --> 336.96]  My name is Jason Truel.
[337.04 --> 344.76]  It's my privilege and honor to lead us in our worship as we gather together in the name of the Lord on this Lord's Day.
[344.94 --> 351.46]  If you are visiting with us, I know there are some families with us visiting for the baptism of Evelyn Grace.
[351.78 --> 354.78]  So today we'll have a baptism, so that's always a joyful day.
[354.78 --> 360.94]  And so as we begin, there's just a few announcements for us this morning.
[361.26 --> 367.38]  On the front of your bulletin, take note that next Sunday we will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[367.82 --> 374.54]  It's a way to bless the citizens of, or the people of Mountain View Manor.
[374.54 --> 377.54]  And so it's 2 o'clock next Sunday.
[378.58 --> 390.88]  As well, importantly, right after the service today, we will be affirming by ballot the nominations of two elder candidates.
[390.88 --> 398.76]  So this will happen right after the service, and this is for those who are official registered members of our church.
[398.98 --> 401.12]  Many of, some of us are friends.
[401.24 --> 402.36]  We call friends of the congregation.
[402.54 --> 403.46]  You're not officially members.
[403.68 --> 404.94]  We love you, but you may not vote.
[405.70 --> 413.08]  You can still stay, but we'll pass out the ballots to those who are members after the service to affirm those who have been nominated.
[413.08 --> 418.90]  In addition, there's something else.
[419.00 --> 419.34]  Oh, yeah.
[420.12 --> 424.08]  For our summer camp, there's some opportunities also to volunteer.
[424.86 --> 427.90]  And there's a sign-up sheet also if your kids have not yet signed up.
[428.26 --> 430.06]  I think we have over 30 people registered.
[430.56 --> 431.58]  Our cap is 60.
[432.44 --> 436.96]  But, you know, please do sign up and invite your friends also to come and join us for that.
[436.96 --> 444.98]  And this summer, in July and August, we will actually be having one combined class,
[445.04 --> 451.58]  and we're having a new teacher from the outside come to teach the class to give our teachers a break.
[451.64 --> 452.76]  Her name is Heda Huang.
[453.10 --> 455.66]  She's a grade 11 student at Richmond Christian School.
[456.42 --> 460.40]  And so she will be coming and teaching our class for eight weeks in July and August,
[460.56 --> 463.12]  but we will still need some helpers.
[463.12 --> 468.86]  And I want to encourage you, if you are not otherwise involved in Sunday school regularly,
[469.18 --> 472.16]  to just sign up for one day this summer to be a helper.
[472.28 --> 476.32]  That way we can give our regular helpers and teachers a break for the summer.
[476.98 --> 477.32]  Okay.
[477.46 --> 478.60]  I think that's all for now.
[479.94 --> 483.12]  So let's now listen as God calls us.
[483.24 --> 484.30]  Oh, yeah.
[485.38 --> 485.84]  Okay.
[486.14 --> 487.64]  There's another one more thing,
[487.64 --> 493.76]  which is that as a church of the Christian Reformed Church,
[493.92 --> 498.46]  we give to our ministry shares for our denomination.
[499.14 --> 505.06]  And so there is a little video of thanks that has been prepared to share with you all.
[505.60 --> 505.70]  Okay.
[505.88 --> 507.90]  So let's watch this couple-minute video.
[508.38 --> 510.46]  Hi, everyone at Ladner CRC.
[510.46 --> 515.06]  I'm Al Posma, and I serve as the executive director of the Christian Reformed Church here in Canada.
[515.06 --> 519.56]  Thank you for your contribution and participation in our shared ministry.
[520.24 --> 525.48]  Your gift to ministry shares means the Christian Reformed Church is able to support churches like yours.
[525.90 --> 526.90]  But not only that,
[527.00 --> 532.68]  your contributions mean that you have an outsized impact in sharing the good news of the gospel in our world.
[533.22 --> 537.24]  By partnering together, we are able to do more than we could on our own.
[537.88 --> 541.52]  Here's some of the good news about each of the agencies that you support.
[541.52 --> 549.18]  Resonate is your mission agency and has more than 140 missionaries serving in 43 countries.
[549.76 --> 555.56]  They are also partnering with 60 churches in North America, including three new ones in the past year.
[556.04 --> 559.12]  And this number is expected to grow in the coming year.
[560.20 --> 564.44]  Reframe is a media ministry of the CRC that is proclaiming the gospel,
[564.92 --> 569.60]  discipling believers, and strengthening the church worldwide in 10 major languages.
[569.60 --> 575.80]  One of those is in Burkina Faso, where the French language ministry is reaching new people for Christ,
[576.02 --> 579.80]  and the church is growing faster than the ministry can even seem to keep up.
[580.84 --> 585.66]  Thrive is helping churches like yours with encouragement, connections, and tools.
[586.48 --> 591.90]  This year, Thrive staff have provided over 350 unique consultations to churches,
[592.36 --> 597.02]  helping them to address needs and opportunities within their own local ministry contexts.
[597.02 --> 602.90]  Calvin Seminary is offering some new creative approaches to raising up new leaders,
[603.34 --> 610.10]  including Empower, a creative mentor-based method for obtaining a ministry degree happening right here in Canada.
[610.78 --> 615.82]  We also have Canadian-specific justice ministries, such as our Indigenous ministry,
[615.94 --> 622.82]  which has continued the journey toward reconciliation with over 500 people across Canada through Hearts Exchanged.
[622.82 --> 627.52]  Our intercultural ministry has walked alongside 13 churches last year
[627.52 --> 631.22]  as they seek to be healthy, multicultural expressions of the gospel.
[631.80 --> 638.62]  The Center for Public Dialogue continues to equip churches to engage as faithful participants in our national community.
[639.26 --> 645.86]  And as always, the denominational offices are ready to answer your questions about church benefit plans,
[645.86 --> 650.56]  pension funds, insurance, and planned giving, all of those interesting things.
[651.32 --> 656.48]  The One Click, One Call team answered over 12,900 of your phone calls this year.
[657.12 --> 662.32]  Thank you for your financial support that helps your church be poised to share the gospel
[662.32 --> 666.28]  and for the ways that we collaborate together for Kingdom Impact.
[675.86 --> 681.94]  So as you can see, maybe that was a bit overwhelming, but we are involved in many things through the denomination.
[682.48 --> 686.12]  And you can actually explore more about each of those through the website.
[686.38 --> 690.56]  I mean, I kind of sound like an ad right now, but go to the website, CRCNA,
[690.84 --> 693.42]  and you can read about these different ministries we're involved in.
[693.82 --> 697.14]  And there's actually also a Canada-specific part of the website
[697.14 --> 700.22]  where you can learn more about those specific Canada ministries.
[700.22 --> 706.00]  Okay, so now let us hear God call us to worship this morning.
[706.44 --> 708.76]  Our call to worship is from Psalm 47.
[709.10 --> 710.28]  We'll say this responsibly.
[711.64 --> 714.94]  God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
[715.90 --> 719.12]  the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
[719.80 --> 722.56]  Sing praises to God, sing praises.
[723.28 --> 726.66]  Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
[727.08 --> 730.00]  For God is the King of all the earth,
[730.84 --> 733.58]  sing to Him a psalm of praise.
[734.16 --> 735.96]  God reigns over the nations.
[737.00 --> 739.64]  God is seated on His holy throne.
[740.48 --> 745.88]  And the reason for choosing that psalm for a call to worship is today is Ascension Sunday.
[746.66 --> 750.12]  It's the day when we remember that Christ ascended to heaven
[750.12 --> 753.48]  and is seated on the throne at the right hand of God the Father.
[754.00 --> 758.58]  So let's come before this God in a prayer of adoration.
[758.86 --> 759.58]  Let's pray together.
[760.22 --> 761.74]  Father,
[761.74 --> 763.44]  Heavenly Father,
[763.44 --> 763.46]  Heavenly Father,
[763.56 --> 765.48]  you created the heavens and the earth.
[766.18 --> 768.16]  You stretched out the heavens,
[768.34 --> 769.62]  you formed the earth,
[769.68 --> 771.42]  and all that comes from it.
[772.12 --> 772.36]  Lord,
[772.44 --> 776.60]  you give the breath of life to all who walk on the face of the earth.
[776.60 --> 782.62]  all creation testifies to your majesty and your power and your kindness.
[783.96 --> 789.24]  Lord Jesus, you conquered sin and death and you now reign victorious on your throne.
[789.70 --> 795.74]  You are worthy of praise with all of our heart and our souls, our minds, and our strength.
[796.88 --> 799.94]  And so we pray that we would offer you our worship this morning.
[799.94 --> 807.60]  Lord, we worship you with voices raised and with ears that are open to hear your word,
[807.92 --> 814.64]  with hearts that are filled with gratitude, with eyes that long to see your glory and your grace.
[815.56 --> 819.62]  We rejoice to be gathered in your name this morning, Lord.
[819.64 --> 827.72]  And we praise you, Holy Spirit, for dwelling in us and among us and that you make us joyful worshipers.
[827.72 --> 832.76]  And may the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be pleasing in your sight.
[833.44 --> 835.94]  O Lord, our rock and our redeemer. Amen.
[836.96 --> 841.72]  Let's all rise and hear God's greeting to us this morning from Galatians chapter 1.
[841.72 --> 847.92]  God says, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[847.92 --> 852.72]  who gave himself for our sins to set us free from the present evil age,
[853.20 --> 859.16]  according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
[859.60 --> 863.14]  As God has greeted us, let's turn and greet one another around us.
[863.14 --> 870.24]  thank you again of God's greeting generations.
[870.42 --> 872.20]  for them to be with us.
[872.38 --> 874.56]  Thank you very much.
[874.80 --> 876.90]  thank you very much.
[881.34 --> 889.78]  thank you very much.
[889.78 --> 919.76]  Thank you.
[919.78 --> 949.76]  Thank you.
[949.78 --> 951.78]  Thank you.
[979.78 --> 981.78]  Thank you.
[1009.78 --> 1011.78]  Thank you.
[1039.78 --> 1041.78]  Thank you.
[1069.78 --> 1071.78]  Thank you.
[1099.78 --> 1101.78]  Thank you.
[1101.78 --> 1103.78]  Thank you.
[1103.78 --> 1105.78]  Thank you.
[1105.78 --> 1107.78]  Thank you.
[1107.78 --> 1109.78]  Thank you.
[1109.78 --> 1113.78]  Thank you.
[1113.78 --> 1115.78]  Thank you.
[1115.78 --> 1117.78]  Thank you.
[1117.78 --> 1119.78]  Thank you.
[1119.78 --> 1121.78]  Thank you.
[1121.78 --> 1123.78]  Thank you.
[1123.78 --> 1125.78]  Thank you.
[1125.78 --> 1127.78]  Thank you.
[1127.78 --> 1129.78]  Thank you.
[1129.78 --> 1131.78]  Thank you.
[1131.78 --> 1133.78]  Thank you.
[1133.78 --> 1135.78]  Thank you.
[1135.78 --> 1137.78]  Thank you.
[1137.78 --> 1139.78]  Thank you.
[1139.78 --> 1141.78]  Thank you.
[1141.78 --> 1143.78]  Thank you.
[1143.78 --> 1145.78]  Thank you.
[1145.78 --> 1147.78]  Thank you.
[1147.78 --> 1150.78]  Thank you.
[1150.78 --> 1150.96]  Thank you.
[1153.78 --> 1155.78]  Thank you.
[1155.78 --> 1157.42]  Thank you.
[1157.42 --> 1161.60]  And drenched in tears
[1161.60 --> 1165.28]  They laid him down
[1165.28 --> 1169.06]  In Joseph's tomb
[1169.06 --> 1172.70]  The entrance here
[1172.70 --> 1176.66]  By heavy storm
[1176.66 --> 1180.22]  Messiah still
[1180.22 --> 1183.58]  And all alone
[1183.58 --> 1192.68]  O praise the name
[1192.68 --> 1196.72]  Of the Lord our God
[1196.72 --> 1200.46]  O praise His name
[1200.46 --> 1204.26]  Forevermore
[1204.26 --> 1207.78]  For endless days
[1207.78 --> 1211.86]  We will sing Your praise
[1211.86 --> 1213.84]  O Lord
[1213.84 --> 1217.86]  O Lord our God
[1218.42 --> 1224.86]  When all the third
[1226.28 --> 1228.86]  Hath break of dawn
[1229.74 --> 1232.86]  The Son of Hell
[1232.86 --> 1237.18]  And rose again
[1237.18 --> 1238.86]  O Troubleman
[1238.86 --> 1243.86]  Where is Your sting
[1243.86 --> 1247.86]  The angels roar
[1247.86 --> 1251.86]  For Christ the King
[1251.86 --> 1259.96]  O praise the name
[1259.96 --> 1260.96]  O praise the name
[1260.96 --> 1263.96]  Of the Lord our God
[1263.96 --> 1267.86]  O praise His name
[1267.86 --> 1270.86]  Forevermore
[1270.86 --> 1274.86]  For endless days
[1274.86 --> 1276.86]  We will sing
[1276.86 --> 1278.86]  We will sing Your praise
[1278.86 --> 1280.86]  O Lord
[1280.86 --> 1284.86]  O Lord our God
[1284.86 --> 1286.86]  O Lord our God
[1286.86 --> 1290.86]  O Lord our God
[1290.86 --> 1292.86]  We shall return
[1292.86 --> 1295.86]  In robes of white
[1295.86 --> 1297.86]  The blessing
[1297.86 --> 1299.86]  The blessing sun
[1299.86 --> 1303.86]  Shall pierce the night
[1303.86 --> 1306.86]  And I will rise
[1306.86 --> 1308.86]  O Lord our God
[1308.86 --> 1309.86]  O Lord our God
[1309.86 --> 1310.86]  O praise His name
[1310.86 --> 1312.86]  O praise His name
[1312.86 --> 1314.86]  Forevermore
[1314.86 --> 1318.86]  For endless days
[1318.86 --> 1319.86]  We will sing
[1324.86 --> 1336.62]  In god
[1340.84 --> 1341.14]  For endless days
[1341.14 --> 1346.14]  We will sing your praise
[1346.68 --> 1352.14]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[1352.14 --> 1360.14]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[1360.14 --> 1368.14]  O Lord, O Lord our God
[1371.14 --> 1377.20]  Be seated.
[1383.20 --> 1389.54]  So many things in our lives often seem better than God.
[1390.44 --> 1393.04]  They seem better than what he offers to us.
[1393.98 --> 1396.50]  You know, maybe it's the hope of an upcoming vacation
[1396.50 --> 1399.96]  or the praise and the approval of others
[1399.96 --> 1402.06]  or even just a good night's sleep.
[1403.90 --> 1406.96]  And we taste and we see so many earthly things
[1407.50 --> 1410.30]  that promise satisfaction, promise to satisfy
[1410.30 --> 1412.60]  and yet what we find is
[1412.60 --> 1416.44]  as many, as good as some of them are and can be
[1416.44 --> 1418.98]  at the same time they fail to fully
[1418.98 --> 1421.16]  and finally deliver us.
[1422.38 --> 1424.32]  You know, these comforts and fleeting pleasures
[1424.32 --> 1427.26]  can seem better to me than Christ
[1427.26 --> 1430.28]  when my heart is not attuned to him.
[1431.32 --> 1433.94]  And when, you know, we face challenges in life
[1433.94 --> 1435.32]  and we face disappointments,
[1435.72 --> 1438.08]  our hearts tend to turn inward
[1438.08 --> 1440.06]  instead of Godward.
[1441.26 --> 1443.22]  But God, because he loves us,
[1443.26 --> 1446.44]  always invites us back into communion with him,
[1446.50 --> 1448.32]  into fellowship with him.
[1448.32 --> 1451.18]  And he invites us to know his forgiveness
[1451.18 --> 1455.38]  and to find him as ultimately satisfying.
[1456.32 --> 1459.36]  So that's what we do when we come to confession
[1459.36 --> 1463.48]  is we look to Christ to fully satisfy us.
[1463.58 --> 1465.74]  So would you please join me as I lead us
[1465.74 --> 1467.02]  in a prayer of confession?
[1467.02 --> 1471.52]  O Lord, we are sinners, poor and needy,
[1472.14 --> 1474.74]  weak and wounded, sick and sore.
[1475.70 --> 1479.34]  This past week, Lord, and even maybe this morning,
[1479.48 --> 1481.02]  Lord, we have transgressed your law.
[1481.70 --> 1484.36]  We have lived for our own glory and desires
[1484.36 --> 1485.18]  instead of yours.
[1486.08 --> 1487.70]  We have taken what we want
[1487.70 --> 1489.78]  instead of giving to you and to others.
[1490.66 --> 1493.42]  We have served and defended ourselves
[1493.42 --> 1495.94]  and we have failed to love you
[1495.94 --> 1497.40]  and to love our neighbors.
[1498.44 --> 1499.84]  Have mercy on us, O God,
[1499.90 --> 1501.52]  according to your steadfast love.
[1502.16 --> 1504.22]  Would you forgive us and raise us from sin
[1504.22 --> 1506.08]  that we may be your faithful people,
[1506.82 --> 1509.22]  obeying the commands of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1509.22 --> 1510.32]  who rules the world
[1510.32 --> 1513.18]  and is head of the church, his body.
[1513.96 --> 1515.08]  We pray in Christ's name.
[1515.56 --> 1515.86]  Amen.
[1517.68 --> 1519.96]  So we have a God who is full of love
[1519.96 --> 1522.24]  and mercy, kindness and forgiveness,
[1522.24 --> 1524.62]  and he has forgiven us
[1524.62 --> 1526.18]  through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1526.40 --> 1527.90]  So hear these words of assurance
[1527.90 --> 1530.02]  from Ezekiel chapter 36.
[1532.10 --> 1533.22]  The prophet Ezekiel,
[1533.46 --> 1536.48]  the Lord says through the prophet Ezekiel,
[1536.60 --> 1536.92]  he says,
[1537.02 --> 1539.00]  I will sprinkle clean water on you
[1539.00 --> 1540.62]  and you will be clean.
[1541.24 --> 1543.42]  I will cleanse you from all of your impurities
[1543.42 --> 1544.60]  and from all your idols.
[1545.02 --> 1546.60]  I will give you a new heart
[1546.60 --> 1548.12]  and put a new spirit in you.
[1548.12 --> 1551.36]  I will remove from you your heart of stone
[1551.36 --> 1553.44]  and give you a heart of flesh.
[1554.06 --> 1555.82]  And I will put my spirit in you
[1555.82 --> 1558.14]  and move you to follow my decrees
[1558.14 --> 1560.02]  and be careful to keep my laws.
[1560.72 --> 1562.24]  Then you will live in the land
[1562.24 --> 1563.44]  I give your ancestors.
[1564.32 --> 1565.28]  You will be my people
[1565.28 --> 1567.86]  and I will be your God.
[1569.44 --> 1570.00]  Amen.
[1570.72 --> 1571.60]  Let's stand.
[1571.70 --> 1573.68]  Let's sing a song of response
[1573.68 --> 1575.56]  to God's grace for us.
[1575.56 --> 1597.40]  How deep the Father's love for us
[1597.40 --> 1602.96]  How vast beyond all measure
[1602.96 --> 1610.06]  That we should give his only Son
[1610.06 --> 1615.74]  To make a wretch his treasure
[1615.74 --> 1623.38]  How great the pain of searing loss
[1623.38 --> 1629.64]  The Father turns his face away
[1629.64 --> 1636.36]  As those which mar the chosen one
[1636.36 --> 1642.32]  Bring many sons to glory
[1642.32 --> 1656.96]  Behold the man upon a cross
[1656.96 --> 1662.78]  My sin upon his shoulders
[1662.78 --> 1669.58]  Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[1669.58 --> 1676.26]  Fall out among the scoffers
[1676.26 --> 1682.48]  It was my sin that held him there
[1682.48 --> 1688.16]  Until it was accomplished
[1688.16 --> 1695.62]  His dying breath has brought me life
[1695.62 --> 1701.62]  I know that it is finished
[1701.62 --> 1716.62]  I will not boast in anything
[1716.62 --> 1722.62]  No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[1722.62 --> 1723.62]  He is done
[1723.62 --> 1729.62]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1729.62 --> 1735.62]  His death and resurrection
[1735.62 --> 1737.62]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1737.62 --> 1739.62]  His death and resurrection
[1739.62 --> 1742.62]  But I should again from his reward
[1742.62 --> 1749.62]  I cannot give an answer
[1749.62 --> 1757.36]  But this I know with all my heart
[1757.36 --> 1762.62]  His wounds have paved my ground
[1762.62 --> 1763.62]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1763.62 --> 1764.62]  He is done
[1764.62 --> 1765.62]  Let us come
[1765.62 --> 1766.62]  Let us come
[1766.62 --> 1767.62]  Let us come
[1767.62 --> 1781.18]  Today is a joyful day
[1781.18 --> 1788.30]  Because today we have the joy of baptizing Evelyn Grace Van Rijn
[1788.30 --> 1793.26]  So may I welcome Jason and Michaela up
[1793.26 --> 1796.10]  And William of course
[1796.10 --> 1799.40]  And so as we are coming up
[1799.40 --> 1802.92]  Let me say a few words about baptism
[1802.92 --> 1808.54]  So first, baptism is a picture and a pledge
[1808.54 --> 1810.80]  Of our union with Christ
[1810.80 --> 1814.94]  Through baptism we are united to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1814.94 --> 1820.00]  Second, the waters of baptism is a picture and pledge
[1820.00 --> 1822.24]  Of our forgiveness of sins
[1822.24 --> 1822.56]  Right?
[1822.64 --> 1824.00]  As the old hymn says
[1824.00 --> 1826.56]  What can wash away my sins?
[1827.44 --> 1829.36]  Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1829.36 --> 1834.70]  Third, baptism is a picture and pledge of regeneration
[1834.70 --> 1836.80]  Or the giving of a new heart
[1836.80 --> 1840.32]  And that is the only hope of us and of our children
[1840.32 --> 1842.78]  Baptism doesn't save us
[1842.78 --> 1846.94]  Our true hope is just as Jesus taught Nicodemus
[1846.94 --> 1849.58]  That we need to be born again of water and of spirit
[1849.58 --> 1852.12]  And that is something that the Holy Spirit does
[1852.12 --> 1855.14]  In our lives and in the lives of our children
[1855.14 --> 1856.44]  And that is our hope
[1856.44 --> 1861.30]  Fourth, baptism is a picture and pledge of our adoption
[1861.30 --> 1863.00]  Into God's family
[1863.00 --> 1865.48]  The Apostle John writes
[1865.48 --> 1868.64]  See what great love the Father has lavished on us
[1868.64 --> 1870.52]  That we shall be called children of God
[1870.52 --> 1872.80]  And then fifth and finally
[1872.80 --> 1877.82]  Baptism is a picture and a pledge of resurrection
[1877.82 --> 1880.86]  Resurrection to everlasting life
[1880.86 --> 1882.20]  Paul says
[1882.20 --> 1885.70]  For if we have been united to him in a death like his
[1885.70 --> 1888.80]  We will certainly also be united to him
[1888.80 --> 1891.66]  In a resurrection like his
[1891.66 --> 1893.08]  And so Jason and Michaela
[1893.08 --> 1897.88]  Having heard God's gracious promises to our children
[1897.88 --> 1899.04]  In baptism
[1899.04 --> 1903.76]  Do you desire that your daughter Evelyn Grace be baptized today?
[1904.52 --> 1905.20]  We do, okay
[1905.20 --> 1906.08]  So
[1906.08 --> 1909.42]  I'm going to ask you to make two vows
[1909.42 --> 1912.16]  And you can just say we do
[1912.16 --> 1915.28]  And then to the congregation I'll ask you to say
[1915.28 --> 1916.76]  To take a vow as well
[1916.76 --> 1918.28]  So first
[1918.28 --> 1921.72]  Do you believe that your child
[1921.72 --> 1922.82]  Your children
[1922.82 --> 1924.88]  Though sinful by nature
[1924.88 --> 1927.50]  Are received by God in Christ
[1927.50 --> 1928.90]  As members of his covenant
[1928.90 --> 1930.52]  And therefore ought to be baptized
[1930.52 --> 1935.06]  And do you promise a reliance on the Holy Spirit
[1935.06 --> 1937.40]  And with the help of the Christian community
[1937.40 --> 1939.98]  To do all in your power
[1939.98 --> 1943.94]  To instruct your child in the Christian faith
[1943.94 --> 1946.00]  And to lead her by your example
[1946.00 --> 1948.22]  Into a life of Christian discipleship
[1948.22 --> 1950.16]  Congregation
[1950.16 --> 1952.88]  If you are able
[1952.88 --> 1954.08]  Please do stand
[1954.08 --> 1955.34]  In body or in spirit
[1955.34 --> 1957.76]  As we take this vow together
[1957.76 --> 1959.26]  Congregation
[1959.26 --> 1961.36]  Do you promise to love, encourage, and support
[1961.36 --> 1962.46]  Jason and Michaela
[1962.46 --> 1963.64]  And their children
[1963.64 --> 1965.64]  By teaching the gospel of God's love
[1965.64 --> 1967.32]  By being an example
[1967.32 --> 1969.08]  Of Christian faith and character
[1969.08 --> 1971.48]  And by giving the strong support
[1971.48 --> 1972.90]  Of God's family
[1972.90 --> 1973.58]  And fellowship
[1973.58 --> 1974.16]  Prayer
[1974.16 --> 1974.94]  And service
[1974.94 --> 1976.26]  If so say we do
[1976.26 --> 1977.74]  Thank you
[1977.74 --> 1978.38]  You may be seated
[1978.38 --> 1979.22]  Yes
[1979.22 --> 1982.26]  You know the drill
[1982.26 --> 1993.12]  May I hold her?
[1994.40 --> 1995.28]  Okay Evelyn Grace
[1995.28 --> 1996.18]  You and me
[1996.18 --> 1997.18]  We're going to do this
[1997.18 --> 1998.24]  Okay
[1998.24 --> 1998.98]  Yes
[1998.98 --> 2000.24]  You are such a
[2000.24 --> 2001.66]  Very easy going kid
[2001.66 --> 2004.48]  So Evelyn Grace
[2004.48 --> 2006.26]  It is for you
[2006.26 --> 2007.72]  That Christ came into the world
[2007.72 --> 2009.42]  It is for you
[2009.42 --> 2010.84]  That he lived
[2010.84 --> 2011.64]  It is for you
[2011.64 --> 2012.76]  That he suffered and died
[2012.76 --> 2013.64]  It is for you
[2013.64 --> 2014.58]  That he rose again
[2014.58 --> 2015.90]  And he ascended into heaven
[2015.90 --> 2017.06]  It is for you
[2017.06 --> 2018.30]  That he will return
[2018.30 --> 2021.68]  And did all this for you
[2021.68 --> 2022.24]  Little one
[2022.24 --> 2023.08]  Even though you know
[2023.08 --> 2024.02]  Nothing of it yet
[2024.02 --> 2027.00]  For truly
[2027.00 --> 2028.82]  We love
[2028.82 --> 2031.36]  Because Christ first loved us
[2031.36 --> 2034.56]  So Evelyn Grace
[2034.56 --> 2036.36]  I baptize you
[2036.36 --> 2037.58]  In the name of the Father
[2037.58 --> 2038.94]  And of the Son
[2038.94 --> 2040.44]  And of the Holy Spirit
[2040.44 --> 2042.64]  And even though

[2055.04 --> 2056.26]  Turn his face
[2056.26 --> 2057.12]  Toward you
[2057.12 --> 2058.10]  Be gracious to you
[2058.10 --> 2058.96]  And may he lift up
[2058.96 --> 2060.08]  His countenance upon you
[2060.08 --> 2061.36]  And give you peace

[2433.94 --> 2449.50]  Sing like never before, oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[2449.50 --> 2466.38]  Worship your holy name, Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[2466.38 --> 2485.80]  So at this time, the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes and their
[2485.80 --> 2487.32]  teachers and their assistants.
[2487.32 --> 2501.82]  So we are in a sermon series in the book of Romans, kind of working our way through Romans
[2501.82 --> 2503.12]  passage by passage.
[2503.58 --> 2509.44]  Today we are in Romans chapter 6, and so would you turn there in your Bibles with me, Romans
[2509.44 --> 2510.34]  chapter 6.
[2511.02 --> 2514.00]  We'll be reading verse 15 to the end of the chapter.
[2517.32 --> 2528.28]  That's on page 840 of your Bible.
[2531.02 --> 2534.54]  So Romans chapter 6, beginning in verse 15.
[2535.40 --> 2536.20]  What then?
[2537.06 --> 2540.50]  Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?
[2540.90 --> 2541.84]  By no means.
[2542.52 --> 2546.82]  Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves?
[2547.32 --> 2552.24]  You are slaves to the one whom you obey, whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death,
[2552.44 --> 2554.66]  or to obedience, which leads to righteousness.
[2555.62 --> 2561.32]  But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed
[2561.32 --> 2563.92]  the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.
[2564.60 --> 2569.94]  You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
[2569.94 --> 2574.72]  I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves.
[2575.62 --> 2580.78]  Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity, to ever-increasing
[2580.78 --> 2586.16]  wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness, leading to holiness.
[2587.04 --> 2591.08]  When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
[2591.86 --> 2595.70]  What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of?
[2595.70 --> 2597.48]  Those things result in death.
[2598.34 --> 2604.04]  But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit
[2604.04 --> 2608.06]  you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
[2608.48 --> 2615.98]  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2616.86 --> 2617.78]  Thanks be to God.
[2617.78 --> 2622.78]  Thank you.
[2624.32 --> 2625.26]  What am I supposed to say?
[2625.62 --> 2626.84]  Ah, this is the word of the Lord.
[2627.40 --> 2628.50]  Thank you, God.
[2628.68 --> 2628.98]  Okay.
[2631.88 --> 2632.52]  Let's pray.
[2634.90 --> 2640.22]  Our Father, we thank you for your word, which is absolutely true and given to us in your love
[2640.22 --> 2640.64]  for us.
[2641.42 --> 2643.78]  Lord, to know you is eternal life.
[2643.78 --> 2652.10]  And so we ask, O Lord, that you will bless us this day and enable us to listen, to learn,
[2652.24 --> 2655.66]  to obey, to trust, and to live for the glory of God.
[2656.24 --> 2659.86]  In the name of Jesus and by the power of the Holy Spirit at work in us, we pray.
[2660.42 --> 2660.78]  Amen.
[2663.34 --> 2670.46]  And so I heard, I don't often use sports analogies, but I heard this story that I think is a good
[2670.46 --> 2672.44]  window into our passage today.
[2673.46 --> 2677.00]  So there's a high school football player who is pretty good.
[2677.92 --> 2684.64]  And the main reason he was good was because he had a distinct advantage over all the other
[2684.64 --> 2685.10]  players.
[2686.00 --> 2688.38]  He was the smallest guy on the team.
[2689.50 --> 2694.40]  Now, if you know anything about football, you might think, that doesn't sound like an advantage.
[2694.40 --> 2702.02]  But it was an advantage because he ran the ball and the other team couldn't find him.
[2703.62 --> 2708.02]  So when they had just, you know, when they just had to get the yardage, you know, to make
[2708.02 --> 2713.20]  a first down or to make it into the end zone, they always ran a play with this little guy.
[2713.72 --> 2714.56]  His name was Perry.
[2715.32 --> 2716.32]  Not our Perry.
[2716.32 --> 2724.70]  But so they ran Perry and they also ran Andrew because Andrew was the biggest player on the
[2724.70 --> 2724.96]  team.
[2725.40 --> 2732.38]  So they put Andrew as fullback and Perry, who's this scrawny little guy, as tailback right behind
[2732.38 --> 2732.82]  Andrew.
[2733.58 --> 2739.48]  And Andrew was so big and so powerful over everyone else that he would plow through the defensive
[2739.48 --> 2742.44]  line like Moses parting the Red Sea.
[2742.44 --> 2750.24]  And so every blow and every tackle that was intended for Perry, who was carrying the ball,
[2750.40 --> 2751.30]  landed on Andrew.
[2752.10 --> 2759.24]  And if Perry made the first down or if he ran into the end zone, if he landed in glory, it
[2759.24 --> 2762.48]  was all because of what Andrew accomplished.
[2764.68 --> 2770.04]  And Perry might, you know, dance around with the ball over his head, you know, like he was
[2770.04 --> 2774.50]  hot stuff, but everyone knew it was Andrew.
[2775.56 --> 2778.92]  That you just grab onto Andrew's shirt and go for the ride.
[2780.14 --> 2784.28]  And friends, that is a picture of what it means to be under grace.
[2785.16 --> 2785.30]  Right?
[2785.32 --> 2790.28]  And that's what Paul has been talking about all the way up until now in Romans, that it's
[2790.28 --> 2792.00]  really about Jesus.
[2792.58 --> 2792.78]  Right?
[2792.80 --> 2794.66]  It's not about our performance at all.
[2794.66 --> 2797.42]  It's what Jesus has accomplished for us.
[2797.62 --> 2801.40]  And we just hold on to Jesus and we go for the ride.
[2801.82 --> 2806.74]  And he takes all the blows and he makes it, he makes the way for us.
[2807.70 --> 2808.22]  Right?
[2808.28 --> 2813.34]  You are getting to the promised land because you are united to Jesus.
[2814.76 --> 2818.34]  And that's what being under grace is all about.
[2818.44 --> 2819.42]  It's a free gift.
[2819.42 --> 2822.04]  The free gift of God is eternal life.
[2823.00 --> 2826.10]  And nothing is more beautiful than grace.
[2826.70 --> 2831.68]  And nothing is more powerful, nothing is more dynamic and amazing than grace.
[2833.10 --> 2840.98]  And this grace is so astonishing that Paul knows it's going to lead to a question.
[2841.94 --> 2843.24]  And here's the question.
[2843.36 --> 2845.26]  Look with me at verse 15 in our passage.
[2845.26 --> 2854.78]  Paul asks, rhetorical question, what then, shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?
[2855.40 --> 2856.70]  By no means.
[2857.92 --> 2858.12]  Right?
[2858.20 --> 2864.14]  In other words, does being under grace remove all incentive for obeying God?
[2865.20 --> 2866.20]  Let me say it again.
[2866.20 --> 2873.76]  Does being under grace remove all incentive from obeying God?
[2873.76 --> 2874.16]  Right?
[2875.36 --> 2883.44]  If it's not keeping the law, it's not our moral performance, but it's Jesus who actually saves us, then why keep the law?
[2884.16 --> 2884.30]  Right?
[2884.38 --> 2887.64]  Why pursue holiness and righteousness?
[2888.42 --> 2889.82]  That's a very good question.
[2890.78 --> 2894.86]  And if you are a Christian, it is a question that you have to deal with.
[2895.64 --> 2896.50]  Every day.
[2897.34 --> 2898.52]  Practically every day.
[2898.52 --> 2904.62]  Because, and the question we often ask is, can't I afford a couple of free sins?
[2905.42 --> 2905.66]  Right?
[2905.74 --> 2907.76]  Because I'm under grace.
[2907.88 --> 2909.34]  God's grace will abound.
[2911.26 --> 2912.64]  And what's Paul's answer?
[2914.20 --> 2915.80]  By no means.
[2916.38 --> 2917.26]  By no means.
[2918.62 --> 2922.74]  And then he goes on to explain the answer more fully.
[2922.74 --> 2929.78]  And so we're going to look at Paul's answer to this question by kind of considering three questions this morning.
[2930.32 --> 2932.88]  The first question is, who is your master?
[2933.74 --> 2935.84]  The second question is, what is freedom?
[2936.66 --> 2939.30]  And the third question is, where does it lead?
[2939.90 --> 2941.38]  Okay, so who is your master?
[2941.68 --> 2942.42]  What is freedom?
[2943.14 --> 2944.02]  Where does it lead?
[2944.56 --> 2946.40]  So first, who is your master?
[2946.40 --> 2955.76]  And Paul says, the reason why we don't go on sinning because we are now under grace is because sin is no longer your master.
[2956.52 --> 2958.52]  But now Jesus is your master.
[2958.66 --> 2962.38]  And he talked about this already in the first part of chapter 6.
[2962.46 --> 2964.20]  But he's just continuing on this theme.
[2964.50 --> 2966.76]  So we're going to continue on this theme a bit again today.
[2967.36 --> 2968.84]  So look with me at verse 16.
[2969.84 --> 2970.44]  Paul says,
[2970.44 --> 2992.40]  So now Paul is using an analogy here that comes from the context of first century Rome.
[2993.20 --> 2993.34]  Okay?
[2993.94 --> 2999.80]  And it's an analogy that will likely be lost on many of us because we don't typically face this situation today.
[2999.80 --> 3001.88]  But here's the situation.
[3002.44 --> 3007.04]  What do you do if you find yourself in financial hardship?
[3008.08 --> 3008.84]  What do you do?
[3009.86 --> 3011.74]  You just don't have enough money.
[3013.08 --> 3018.46]  In Paul's day, when people simply did not have money,
[3019.50 --> 3021.88]  and there are no government programs to help them,
[3021.92 --> 3023.46]  and there's no family to help them,
[3023.68 --> 3026.14]  they would be what we would call truly destitute.
[3026.14 --> 3032.48]  And what would a truly destitute person do in such a circumstance?
[3033.78 --> 3035.20]  Well, there's a couple options.
[3035.32 --> 3042.74]  But one thing they could do would be to freely and willingly offer themselves to someone else as a slave.
[3043.60 --> 3047.78]  And then that master would take care of their basic necessities.
[3048.22 --> 3049.10]  So someone might say,
[3049.18 --> 3049.54]  You know what?
[3049.54 --> 3052.06]  It is better for me to eat and live than to die.
[3053.02 --> 3056.12]  So I will go and willingly enslave myself to someone.
[3056.32 --> 3057.68]  I will be under their dominion.
[3058.18 --> 3059.86]  They will have rights over me,
[3059.86 --> 3061.66]  and I will do what they say.
[3062.06 --> 3065.04]  And in turn, they will, you know, feed me.
[3065.18 --> 3066.04]  They will clothe me.
[3066.14 --> 3067.08]  They will house me.
[3067.70 --> 3069.04]  And sometimes it would be the whole family.
[3070.04 --> 3074.96]  But then I would have a master whom I am obliged to do their will.
[3074.96 --> 3079.06]  And that is the image that Paul is speaking of here.
[3080.30 --> 3081.20]  And so that's the analogy.
[3081.34 --> 3082.52]  And then he goes on to say,
[3082.66 --> 3085.26]  You know, I know it's not a perfect analogy,
[3085.26 --> 3087.60]  because we might begin to think,
[3087.70 --> 3089.46]  Well, being a slave is like onerous.
[3089.54 --> 3090.70]  A slave to Christ is onerous,
[3090.78 --> 3091.84]  which is not the case.
[3092.22 --> 3092.84]  So that's why he's saying,
[3092.90 --> 3094.54]  Well, I'm using this analogy to help us.
[3094.76 --> 3098.66]  But there's enough truth in it for Paul to make his point.
[3098.66 --> 3102.20]  So now then, how does this apply to the Christian life?
[3102.26 --> 3102.88]  What is the point?
[3103.40 --> 3105.22]  Well, notice what Paul says in verse 17.
[3106.38 --> 3106.66]  He says,
[3106.80 --> 3109.96]  But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin,
[3110.60 --> 3112.88]  you have come to obey from your heart
[3112.88 --> 3116.60]  the pattern of teaching that now has claimed your allegiance.
[3117.26 --> 3119.54]  You have been set free from sin
[3119.54 --> 3121.72]  and have become slaves to righteousness.
[3123.68 --> 3127.02]  So Paul here is inviting us to consider a basic misunderstanding.
[3127.02 --> 3129.70]  So remember the question.
[3129.84 --> 3131.50]  Remember the basic issue Paul has.
[3131.86 --> 3132.16]  He's like,
[3132.24 --> 3136.06]  Okay, you think that it is possible to have Jesus as your Lord,
[3136.28 --> 3137.92]  to be under his grace,
[3138.12 --> 3139.40]  and yet to keep on sinning.
[3140.64 --> 3142.96]  The misunderstanding many of us have
[3142.96 --> 3146.68]  is that we tend to think of sin simply as something we do.
[3147.46 --> 3150.60]  We tend to think of sin as, you know, our misdeeds,
[3150.74 --> 3152.76]  our doing wrong things,
[3153.02 --> 3153.82]  and that's true.
[3154.20 --> 3156.06]  But underneath that,
[3156.06 --> 3157.48]  the essence of sin
[3157.48 --> 3159.76]  is that it is a master
[3159.76 --> 3161.46]  that we give ourselves to.
[3162.56 --> 3163.50]  So Paul is saying,
[3163.62 --> 3165.58]  sin in its essence is not what you do,
[3165.64 --> 3166.62]  it's not wrongdoings,
[3166.78 --> 3167.94]  but it's a master
[3167.94 --> 3169.54]  that you give yourselves to.
[3170.42 --> 3171.04]  And sin,
[3171.16 --> 3172.26]  when it is your master,
[3173.22 --> 3175.48]  we have to do what it says.
[3175.68 --> 3177.30]  We have to obey its voice.
[3178.08 --> 3178.72]  But now,
[3178.80 --> 3180.42]  what does it mean that you live under grace?
[3180.42 --> 3182.16]  It means that you have a new master.
[3182.80 --> 3183.18]  Right?
[3183.24 --> 3185.34]  You have been set free from that old master,
[3185.70 --> 3187.88]  and now you belong to God,
[3188.52 --> 3190.12]  where he is now your master.
[3190.52 --> 3193.24]  And so there's this change of ownership.
[3194.10 --> 3195.80]  And this is a massive change
[3195.80 --> 3197.88]  that takes place in the life of every single Christian.
[3198.68 --> 3199.88]  And the question then is,
[3199.98 --> 3200.90]  well, how does that happen?
[3200.98 --> 3203.60]  How does that shift from sin being your master
[3203.60 --> 3205.24]  to now God being your master?
[3205.24 --> 3206.34]  How does that happen?
[3207.56 --> 3209.50]  And if you look again at verse 17,
[3209.72 --> 3210.44]  Paul says,
[3211.08 --> 3213.00]  you have come to obey from your heart
[3213.00 --> 3214.14]  the pattern of teaching
[3214.14 --> 3216.92]  that has now claimed your allegiance.
[3218.28 --> 3219.26]  And so that phrase,
[3219.42 --> 3220.94]  claimed your allegiance,
[3221.86 --> 3224.58]  what it literally means is
[3224.58 --> 3226.28]  to be given over.
[3227.06 --> 3230.88]  That God has given you over.
[3231.88 --> 3234.54]  Now, as we've been through Romans,
[3234.54 --> 3235.94]  do you remember,
[3236.44 --> 3238.44]  when is the time that we heard that phrase
[3238.44 --> 3241.20]  that God gave someone over?
[3242.34 --> 3244.38]  It was in chapter one, right?
[3244.68 --> 3247.04]  When we hear about the consequences of sin,
[3247.10 --> 3248.78]  that God gave people over
[3248.78 --> 3250.72]  to the lust that was in their hearts.
[3251.60 --> 3253.28]  And so in chapter one, verse 24,
[3253.90 --> 3254.46]  Paul says,
[3254.56 --> 3255.80]  God gave them over
[3255.80 --> 3257.88]  in the sinful desires of their hearts.
[3258.28 --> 3259.90]  And that was a judgment on sin.
[3260.28 --> 3261.74]  But now what happens
[3261.74 --> 3264.02]  is there's this incredible reversal
[3264.02 --> 3265.56]  where God gives us over
[3265.56 --> 3267.22]  not to sin and judgment,
[3267.42 --> 3268.38]  but to blessing.
[3270.12 --> 3270.86]  And specifically,
[3271.06 --> 3271.56]  Paul says,
[3271.68 --> 3273.14]  we're given over
[3273.14 --> 3274.78]  to what he calls
[3274.78 --> 3276.02]  the pattern of teaching.
[3277.22 --> 3278.74]  So what that means is
[3278.74 --> 3280.12]  you heard the gospel,
[3280.24 --> 3281.38]  you heard the good news,
[3281.74 --> 3282.56]  that Jesus
[3282.56 --> 3285.16]  can be your master,
[3285.28 --> 3286.70]  that he is a good master,
[3286.70 --> 3288.58]  and it captured your heart.
[3290.02 --> 3292.42]  So your heart was grasped
[3292.42 --> 3294.44]  and given over to Christ.
[3294.58 --> 3294.96]  So now,
[3295.04 --> 3297.06]  instead of doing what sin bids you to do,
[3297.62 --> 3299.78]  you are being powerfully conformed
[3299.78 --> 3301.94]  to the pattern of Jesus himself,
[3302.74 --> 3302.92]  right?
[3302.98 --> 3303.84]  To his life,
[3304.10 --> 3304.74]  where you are becoming
[3304.74 --> 3305.70]  more and more like him.
[3305.70 --> 3309.16]  So Paul is saying,
[3309.30 --> 3309.80]  he's saying,
[3309.92 --> 3311.36]  what you cannot say is,
[3311.48 --> 3312.60]  Jesus is my new master,
[3313.34 --> 3314.68]  he has my life,
[3314.88 --> 3316.02]  I've given myself to him
[3316.02 --> 3316.64]  by his grace,
[3316.70 --> 3317.82]  my heart has been captured
[3317.82 --> 3318.88]  by the gospel,
[3319.32 --> 3320.00]  and yet,
[3320.18 --> 3321.82]  continue to submit to sin
[3321.82 --> 3323.76]  as though sin were still your master.
[3325.40 --> 3326.04]  He says,
[3326.14 --> 3326.54]  you can't,
[3326.64 --> 3327.72]  that doesn't make any sense.
[3328.62 --> 3329.44]  So then he goes on
[3329.44 --> 3330.36]  in verse 19,
[3331.48 --> 3331.92]  he says,
[3332.00 --> 3332.36]  so therefore,
[3332.52 --> 3333.66]  just as you used to
[3333.66 --> 3335.04]  offer yourselves as slaves
[3335.04 --> 3336.38]  to impurity,
[3336.74 --> 3338.64]  to ever increasing wickedness
[3338.64 --> 3339.84]  when sin was your master,
[3340.22 --> 3341.12]  so now,
[3341.70 --> 3343.36]  with that same amount of zeal,
[3343.68 --> 3344.92]  that same amount of energy,
[3345.36 --> 3346.84]  the same heart desire,
[3347.20 --> 3348.34]  now offer yourselves
[3348.34 --> 3350.48]  as slaves to righteousness
[3350.48 --> 3351.50]  leading to holiness.
[3352.10 --> 3354.68]  As much as you loved to sin before,
[3355.12 --> 3357.22]  love holiness.
[3359.36 --> 3359.88]  Now,
[3359.98 --> 3360.98]  how can we do this?
[3360.98 --> 3364.32]  How can we stop listening
[3364.32 --> 3367.52]  to sin as our old master,
[3368.00 --> 3369.12]  his voice,
[3369.50 --> 3370.14]  and instead,
[3370.82 --> 3372.16]  offer ourselves to God
[3372.16 --> 3374.38]  to live a holy life?
[3375.24 --> 3375.40]  Well,
[3375.44 --> 3376.48]  Martin Lloyd-Jones
[3376.48 --> 3377.68]  was a British preacher
[3377.68 --> 3378.84]  a generation ago,
[3379.34 --> 3381.36]  and he has a lot of sermons
[3381.36 --> 3381.88]  on Romans,
[3382.06 --> 3383.02]  and one sermon
[3383.02 --> 3384.06]  on Romans chapter 6,
[3384.14 --> 3385.78]  he uses this illustration.
[3386.42 --> 3386.96]  He says,
[3386.96 --> 3388.92]  imagine two fields
[3388.92 --> 3391.32]  divided by a hedge,
[3391.90 --> 3394.74]  and Satan reigns
[3394.74 --> 3397.20]  and rules over one field,
[3397.84 --> 3399.40]  and Christ reigns
[3399.40 --> 3400.16]  in the other field,
[3400.32 --> 3400.92]  and what happens
[3400.92 --> 3401.78]  is that Christ
[3401.78 --> 3404.10]  has transferred you
[3404.10 --> 3405.20]  from that field
[3405.20 --> 3406.16]  where Satan rules
[3406.16 --> 3407.50]  to now the field
[3407.50 --> 3409.26]  where Christ rules,
[3409.44 --> 3410.52]  so you belong to Christ,
[3410.74 --> 3412.26]  but the thing is,
[3412.32 --> 3412.96]  you can still hear
[3413.56 --> 3415.44]  the voice of Satan
[3415.44 --> 3417.36]  calling from across the wall.
[3418.42 --> 3419.32]  So even though
[3419.32 --> 3420.52]  Christ is now your master,
[3420.78 --> 3422.40]  we can still hear
[3422.40 --> 3423.42]  Satan's voice,
[3423.68 --> 3425.64]  and we are conditioned
[3425.64 --> 3427.70]  to listen to his voice
[3427.70 --> 3428.46]  and to obey it.
[3429.84 --> 3430.84]  And so what is the key
[3430.84 --> 3431.66]  of the Christian life
[3431.66 --> 3433.26]  is to move further
[3433.26 --> 3434.82]  and further away
[3434.82 --> 3436.24]  from that boundary
[3436.24 --> 3437.88]  so that Satan's voice
[3437.88 --> 3439.40]  becomes fainter
[3439.40 --> 3441.04]  and fainter over time.
[3442.04 --> 3442.50]  See,
[3442.50 --> 3444.12]  you belong to Christ,
[3444.32 --> 3445.74]  but we continue to sin.
[3445.80 --> 3446.56]  You still listen
[3446.56 --> 3447.64]  to that voice of sin.
[3448.24 --> 3449.26]  So the Christian life
[3449.26 --> 3450.52]  is about moving away
[3450.52 --> 3451.34]  from that voice,
[3452.16 --> 3452.44]  right,
[3452.54 --> 3453.92]  through fellowship,
[3454.42 --> 3454.96]  through worship,
[3455.22 --> 3455.76]  through prayer,
[3455.90 --> 3456.68]  through Bible reading,
[3457.32 --> 3458.28]  through all these things
[3458.28 --> 3460.38]  where we are pursuing Christ,
[3460.50 --> 3461.40]  we're looking toward him,
[3461.54 --> 3462.84]  we're no longer listening
[3462.84 --> 3465.30]  to that old master
[3465.30 --> 3467.44]  who has no claim on us.
[3468.56 --> 3469.16]  Paul says,
[3469.22 --> 3470.00]  you don't have to listen
[3470.00 --> 3470.66]  to him anymore.
[3474.34 --> 3475.42]  So I heard
[3475.42 --> 3477.22]  about this tradition
[3477.22 --> 3479.12]  in the African-American church,
[3479.68 --> 3481.38]  especially in the American South,
[3481.46 --> 3483.14]  where they refer to Jesus
[3483.14 --> 3484.90]  as master.
[3486.10 --> 3487.28]  In white churches,
[3487.40 --> 3488.90]  we tend to refer to Jesus how?
[3490.20 --> 3490.72]  Savior,
[3491.62 --> 3491.96]  Lord,
[3492.48 --> 3492.64]  right,
[3492.70 --> 3493.60]  which means like king.
[3494.22 --> 3496.02]  But in African-American churches,
[3496.02 --> 3496.94]  they refer to him
[3496.94 --> 3498.02]  as master.
[3498.02 --> 3499.00]  They pray to him
[3499.00 --> 3499.90]  as master.
[3500.58 --> 3500.80]  Now,
[3500.86 --> 3501.58]  why is that?
[3502.02 --> 3502.52]  Of course,
[3502.58 --> 3503.72]  the answer traces back
[3503.72 --> 3504.96]  to when they were enslaved.
[3505.92 --> 3507.52]  And they called it Jesus master
[3507.52 --> 3509.66]  because it was subversive.
[3510.94 --> 3512.40]  Because what does the Bible say?
[3513.50 --> 3515.00]  You cannot serve
[3515.00 --> 3516.74]  two masters.
[3517.76 --> 3519.32]  And they couldn't really go
[3519.32 --> 3520.50]  to their slave owner
[3520.50 --> 3521.20]  and say,
[3521.58 --> 3522.46]  you are not my master.
[3522.46 --> 3524.76]  But they could talk
[3524.76 --> 3525.56]  about Jesus
[3525.56 --> 3527.44]  as their master.
[3528.56 --> 3529.08]  And it was a way
[3529.08 --> 3529.72]  of telling
[3529.72 --> 3530.50]  their,
[3530.60 --> 3530.92]  you know,
[3531.00 --> 3531.72]  their overlord,
[3532.26 --> 3533.84]  I only serve one master.
[3533.96 --> 3534.98]  There is one true master
[3534.98 --> 3535.58]  in my life.
[3536.16 --> 3537.50]  And you are not my master.
[3538.20 --> 3539.52]  I may work for you,
[3540.24 --> 3541.84]  but you do not have my heart.
[3543.14 --> 3543.42]  Jesus
[3543.42 --> 3545.00]  has my heart.
[3545.52 --> 3546.34]  He is my master.
[3546.34 --> 3549.46]  So the question for us
[3549.46 --> 3550.46]  here is,
[3550.80 --> 3552.32]  is Jesus your master?
[3553.80 --> 3553.98]  Right?
[3554.04 --> 3555.00]  Does Jesus have
[3555.00 --> 3555.94]  your heart?
[3557.22 --> 3558.60]  Will you serve sin
[3558.60 --> 3560.10]  or will you serve
[3560.10 --> 3560.80]  God?
[3561.06 --> 3562.20]  Those are the only
[3562.20 --> 3563.26]  two options.
[3564.36 --> 3564.72]  And that,
[3564.76 --> 3565.68]  and that really leads us
[3565.68 --> 3566.66]  to our second point,
[3566.80 --> 3567.56]  or second question
[3567.56 --> 3567.96]  this morning,
[3568.04 --> 3568.38]  which is,
[3568.48 --> 3569.08]  what is freedom?
[3569.80 --> 3569.96]  Okay,
[3569.96 --> 3570.56]  what is freedom?
[3570.56 --> 3572.60]  Because another
[3572.60 --> 3573.60]  basic misunderstanding
[3573.60 --> 3574.36]  we have
[3574.36 --> 3575.34]  is often to say,
[3575.58 --> 3575.72]  okay,
[3575.84 --> 3577.08]  Jesus has set me free
[3577.08 --> 3578.96]  and what that means
[3578.96 --> 3580.00]  is that now I can live
[3580.00 --> 3580.98]  however I want to live.
[3581.78 --> 3582.82]  That's a misunderstanding
[3582.82 --> 3583.52]  we have.
[3583.94 --> 3584.96]  And Paul is telling us,
[3585.54 --> 3585.78]  no,
[3585.90 --> 3586.52]  that is not how
[3586.52 --> 3587.34]  freedom works.
[3588.00 --> 3588.14]  Right?
[3588.22 --> 3589.68]  Whatever your master is,
[3589.74 --> 3591.24]  you must obey it.
[3591.76 --> 3592.80]  And the reality
[3592.80 --> 3594.08]  that Paul talks about
[3594.08 --> 3595.40]  is the spiritual condition
[3595.40 --> 3596.44]  of every single person
[3596.44 --> 3598.10]  in this world
[3598.10 --> 3599.34]  is that everybody
[3599.34 --> 3601.14]  is a slave
[3601.14 --> 3601.94]  to something.
[3602.82 --> 3603.22]  Everybody
[3603.22 --> 3604.62]  has to obey
[3604.62 --> 3605.64]  a master.
[3607.00 --> 3607.54]  So this,
[3607.90 --> 3608.04]  you know,
[3608.12 --> 3609.58]  what often comes to mind
[3609.58 --> 3610.18]  on this topic
[3610.18 --> 3611.54]  is the songwriter
[3611.54 --> 3612.08]  Bob Dylan.
[3612.66 --> 3614.02]  He has a song called
[3614.02 --> 3615.38]  Gotta Serve Somebody.
[3616.08 --> 3617.64]  And it's pretty helpful
[3617.64 --> 3618.32]  for us
[3618.32 --> 3619.30]  because the chorus
[3619.30 --> 3620.48]  puts it very simply
[3620.48 --> 3621.22]  and clearly.
[3621.76 --> 3622.26]  He says,
[3622.76 --> 3623.26]  you're gonna have
[3623.26 --> 3624.04]  to serve somebody.
[3624.58 --> 3624.84]  Well,
[3624.88 --> 3625.74]  it may be the devil
[3625.74 --> 3627.02]  or it may be the Lord,
[3627.58 --> 3628.30]  but you're gonna have
[3628.30 --> 3629.02]  to serve somebody.
[3629.34 --> 3632.50]  And so Bob Dylan
[3632.50 --> 3634.92]  agrees with the Apostle Paul.
[3635.68 --> 3635.88]  Right?
[3635.98 --> 3637.62]  That there is no such thing
[3637.62 --> 3639.14]  as human autonomy.
[3639.58 --> 3640.24]  That's what we want
[3640.24 --> 3640.82]  to believe.
[3642.14 --> 3642.42]  He says,
[3642.48 --> 3642.56]  no,
[3642.60 --> 3643.18]  you're gonna have
[3643.18 --> 3643.94]  to serve somebody.
[3645.62 --> 3646.66]  But this is something
[3646.66 --> 3647.50]  that the world
[3647.50 --> 3649.90]  has a really hard time
[3649.90 --> 3650.52]  accepting.
[3651.52 --> 3652.26]  Because the way
[3652.26 --> 3653.62]  the world understands freedom
[3653.62 --> 3655.28]  is that,
[3655.56 --> 3655.90]  to say,
[3656.00 --> 3656.12]  like,
[3656.22 --> 3657.18]  we can have autonomy.
[3657.18 --> 3658.68]  We can be our own boss.
[3659.34 --> 3660.42]  I can be free
[3660.42 --> 3661.48]  to do whatever
[3661.48 --> 3662.24]  I want.
[3662.32 --> 3662.86]  I don't have to listen
[3662.86 --> 3663.32]  to anybody.
[3663.46 --> 3664.48]  I can make my own way.
[3664.58 --> 3665.20]  That is freedom.
[3666.68 --> 3668.16]  And this is a powerful
[3668.16 --> 3668.80]  deception
[3668.80 --> 3671.00]  that even Adam and Eve
[3671.00 --> 3672.36]  fell into as well.
[3672.36 --> 3674.00]  So if we remember
[3674.00 --> 3674.46]  in the garden,
[3674.56 --> 3675.14]  the temptation
[3675.14 --> 3675.78]  of the serpent,
[3675.94 --> 3676.58]  it was to eat
[3676.58 --> 3677.52]  the forbidden fruit
[3677.52 --> 3678.54]  so that you will be
[3678.54 --> 3679.02]  like God.
[3679.10 --> 3680.26]  You will know,
[3681.16 --> 3682.12]  your eyes will be opened
[3682.12 --> 3683.72]  and you will know
[3683.72 --> 3684.38]  good and evil.
[3684.98 --> 3685.82]  In other words,
[3686.30 --> 3687.42]  you will have the freedom
[3687.52 --> 3689.20]  to determine for yourself
[3689.20 --> 3690.40]  what is right and wrong.
[3690.90 --> 3692.10]  You are free from God.
[3692.20 --> 3692.86]  You are independent
[3692.86 --> 3693.32]  from him.
[3693.40 --> 3694.40]  That was the temptation.
[3694.40 --> 3697.34]  But the painful reality
[3697.34 --> 3699.36]  is that disobeying God
[3699.36 --> 3702.10]  broke that close relationship
[3702.10 --> 3703.88]  that we had with him.
[3704.56 --> 3706.42]  And it led to all the suffering
[3706.42 --> 3707.16]  and the death
[3707.16 --> 3708.54]  and the bondage
[3708.54 --> 3709.54]  that we now see
[3709.54 --> 3710.10]  in the world
[3710.10 --> 3710.98]  all around us.
[3712.62 --> 3713.60]  But the reason
[3713.60 --> 3714.36]  that it is such
[3714.36 --> 3715.94]  a powerful lie,
[3716.82 --> 3718.66]  this lie that we can find
[3718.66 --> 3720.12]  freedom apart from God,
[3720.40 --> 3721.00]  is that because
[3721.00 --> 3722.66]  there is a certain truth
[3722.66 --> 3723.18]  in it.
[3724.36 --> 3724.70]  Okay, so,
[3724.78 --> 3725.26]  and this is what
[3725.26 --> 3726.24]  Paul himself says,
[3726.34 --> 3727.80]  that there is
[3727.80 --> 3729.16]  a kind of freedom
[3729.16 --> 3731.54]  in one's slavery to sin.
[3732.16 --> 3733.00]  And what kind of freedom
[3733.00 --> 3733.46]  is it?
[3733.86 --> 3734.96]  If you look at verse 20,
[3736.38 --> 3737.48]  this is what Paul says.
[3738.12 --> 3739.86]  When you were slaves to sin,
[3740.42 --> 3741.30]  you were free
[3741.30 --> 3743.14]  from the control
[3743.14 --> 3743.64]  of righteousness.
[3745.00 --> 3745.48]  Right?
[3745.60 --> 3747.20]  When sin was your master,
[3747.44 --> 3748.12]  in a sense,
[3748.70 --> 3749.90]  you were free from God.
[3750.42 --> 3750.74]  Yes.
[3751.42 --> 3752.08]  You were free
[3752.08 --> 3753.42]  from seeking to honor God
[3753.42 --> 3754.80]  with all that you have
[3754.80 --> 3755.56]  and all that you are.
[3756.34 --> 3757.24]  You didn't have to
[3757.24 --> 3757.90]  give up anything
[3757.90 --> 3759.00]  for God.
[3759.08 --> 3759.58]  You didn't have to
[3759.58 --> 3760.58]  get up on a Sunday morning
[3760.58 --> 3761.50]  and go to church.
[3761.92 --> 3762.64]  You don't have to
[3762.64 --> 3763.80]  suffer for his sake.
[3763.90 --> 3764.50]  You don't have to
[3764.50 --> 3765.08]  be different
[3765.08 --> 3766.58]  from the world around you.
[3768.08 --> 3769.38]  And it's that kind
[3769.38 --> 3769.98]  of freedom
[3769.98 --> 3772.08]  that humanity,
[3773.00 --> 3774.08]  we all want
[3774.72 --> 3775.64]  in our sinfulness
[3775.64 --> 3777.62]  that blinds us
[3777.62 --> 3778.40]  to the reality,
[3778.56 --> 3778.64]  though,
[3778.70 --> 3779.34]  that we are,
[3779.46 --> 3780.02]  in fact,
[3780.02 --> 3781.06]  actually enslaved
[3781.06 --> 3781.48]  to sin.
[3782.52 --> 3782.72]  Right?
[3782.78 --> 3783.24]  And so people
[3783.24 --> 3784.08]  will look at Christianity
[3784.08 --> 3784.70]  and say,
[3784.90 --> 3785.60]  why would you want
[3785.60 --> 3786.20]  to be a Christian?
[3786.48 --> 3787.24]  Because you have
[3787.24 --> 3787.98]  to obey God.
[3788.36 --> 3789.24]  That is slavery.
[3790.46 --> 3791.72]  But they don't realize
[3791.72 --> 3793.24]  that life apart from God
[3793.24 --> 3794.50]  is a terrible kind
[3794.50 --> 3794.88]  of freedom
[3794.88 --> 3796.62]  because it's actually
[3796.62 --> 3797.70]  slavery to sin.
[3798.56 --> 3799.72]  And Paul says,
[3800.12 --> 3800.94]  true freedom
[3800.94 --> 3802.40]  is when we have
[3802.40 --> 3803.18]  been set free
[3803.18 --> 3804.02]  not to autonomy
[3804.70 --> 3805.92]  apart from God,
[3806.00 --> 3807.06]  but to joyful
[3807.06 --> 3808.56]  obedience to God.
[3808.56 --> 3809.60]  That is true freedom.
[3811.14 --> 3812.20]  And so there's a prayer
[3812.20 --> 3813.54]  in the Anglican
[3813.54 --> 3814.38]  Book of Common Prayer.
[3815.20 --> 3816.16]  It puts it very well.
[3816.24 --> 3816.78]  It says this,
[3817.28 --> 3817.80]  O God,
[3817.88 --> 3818.68]  who is the author
[3818.68 --> 3819.54]  of peace
[3819.54 --> 3820.02]  and lover
[3820.02 --> 3820.80]  of concord,
[3821.44 --> 3822.04]  in knowledge
[3822.04 --> 3822.96]  of whom stands
[3822.96 --> 3824.00]  our eternal life,
[3824.12 --> 3824.88]  then note this,
[3825.76 --> 3827.10]  whose service
[3827.10 --> 3829.06]  is perfect freedom.
[3829.06 --> 3833.10]  The service of God
[3833.10 --> 3835.16]  is perfect freedom.
[3835.38 --> 3836.24]  It's true freedom.
[3837.74 --> 3837.94]  Right?
[3837.98 --> 3838.72]  It's not a service
[3838.72 --> 3839.36]  that has anything
[3839.36 --> 3840.20]  to do with fear
[3840.20 --> 3843.04]  or coercion,
[3843.58 --> 3844.86]  but it's actually
[3844.86 --> 3846.94]  heartfelt obedience.
[3848.08 --> 3848.56]  Right?
[3848.60 --> 3849.78]  You're not being coerced
[3849.78 --> 3850.44]  when you're a Christian
[3850.44 --> 3851.82]  to obey God
[3851.82 --> 3852.98]  because it comes
[3852.98 --> 3853.60]  from the heart.
[3853.68 --> 3854.96]  You want to obey God.
[3854.96 --> 3856.78]  That is the wonderful thing
[3856.78 --> 3857.96]  about being under grace.
[3858.42 --> 3860.12]  That we are so overcome
[3860.12 --> 3861.32]  by God's kindness
[3861.32 --> 3863.06]  and his love in Christ
[3863.06 --> 3864.94]  that our hearts desire
[3864.94 --> 3866.86]  to obey his commands.
[3868.94 --> 3870.24]  And so that's the answer
[3870.24 --> 3871.30]  to the question
[3871.30 --> 3872.26]  at the beginning
[3872.26 --> 3872.86]  of the passage.
[3873.04 --> 3873.68]  Do we sin
[3873.68 --> 3875.04]  because we are under grace?
[3875.58 --> 3875.98]  No.
[3876.14 --> 3877.24]  Just the opposite.
[3878.66 --> 3878.80]  Right?
[3878.94 --> 3880.46]  Grace actually brings us
[3880.46 --> 3881.54]  heartfelt obedience.
[3881.54 --> 3883.82]  And it's an obedience
[3883.82 --> 3885.00]  that goes far deeper
[3885.00 --> 3886.72]  than we could ever have
[3886.72 --> 3887.98]  had we not known
[3887.98 --> 3888.56]  the grace
[3888.56 --> 3889.40]  that we are under.
[3891.40 --> 3891.90]  You know,
[3891.94 --> 3892.54]  we often believe
[3892.54 --> 3893.40]  that we have a choice.
[3893.44 --> 3894.38]  It's between keeping
[3894.38 --> 3895.00]  our freedom
[3895.00 --> 3896.90]  or submitting to God.
[3897.06 --> 3898.52]  That's the choice
[3898.52 --> 3899.26]  we think we have.
[3899.32 --> 3900.18]  We keep our own freedom,
[3900.34 --> 3900.62]  okay,
[3900.70 --> 3901.90]  or we submit to God.
[3902.46 --> 3903.64]  But that is not the choice.
[3903.84 --> 3904.64]  The choice is,
[3904.92 --> 3905.96]  will you submit to God
[3905.96 --> 3907.60]  or will you submit to sin?
[3908.20 --> 3909.68]  Will you serve God
[3909.68 --> 3911.16]  or will you serve sin?
[3911.54 --> 3914.92]  And when we serve God,
[3915.02 --> 3915.60]  Paul says,
[3915.92 --> 3917.92]  we experience the freedom
[3917.92 --> 3919.38]  for which Jesus set us free.
[3920.22 --> 3920.38]  Right?
[3920.42 --> 3921.68]  We experience the freedom
[3921.68 --> 3922.66]  for which we were made
[3922.66 --> 3923.64]  as human beings.
[3924.64 --> 3925.86]  And that is true freedom.
[3926.94 --> 3927.86]  And that brings us
[3927.86 --> 3928.40]  to our third
[3928.40 --> 3929.36]  and final question.
[3929.88 --> 3930.84]  Where does it lead?
[3931.48 --> 3931.62]  Okay,
[3931.62 --> 3932.24]  where does it lead?
[3933.70 --> 3935.56]  So the question is,
[3935.82 --> 3937.38]  why shouldn't I just
[3937.38 --> 3938.34]  continue to sin?
[3939.24 --> 3940.48]  Because I'm under grace.
[3941.06 --> 3941.66]  God will forgive.
[3941.90 --> 3942.50]  This is great.
[3942.94 --> 3943.52]  Paul says,
[3943.58 --> 3943.66]  well,
[3943.70 --> 3944.56]  ask yourself this.
[3945.40 --> 3947.48]  Where is that master
[3947.48 --> 3948.84]  obeying sin?
[3949.08 --> 3950.28]  Where is it going to lead you?
[3952.26 --> 3953.80]  And Paul is presenting us
[3953.80 --> 3954.92]  two ways to live.
[3955.52 --> 3955.66]  Okay,
[3955.68 --> 3956.38]  two ways to live.
[3956.46 --> 3958.12]  Two approaches to life.
[3958.86 --> 3960.20]  And each way leads
[3960.20 --> 3961.32]  to a certain destination.
[3962.38 --> 3962.74]  And so,
[3962.86 --> 3964.02]  let's look at verse 21.
[3964.20 --> 3964.94]  It's the first way
[3964.94 --> 3965.60]  he talks about.
[3965.60 --> 3966.54]  He says,
[3966.60 --> 3967.86]  what benefit did you reap
[3967.86 --> 3968.60]  at that time
[3968.60 --> 3969.22]  from the things
[3969.22 --> 3970.44]  that you are now ashamed of?
[3970.86 --> 3971.00]  Like,
[3971.06 --> 3971.36]  all those,
[3971.44 --> 3972.94]  when you were a slave to sin,
[3973.34 --> 3974.18]  doing sin,
[3974.92 --> 3976.02]  and all this stuff
[3976.02 --> 3977.84]  that you are now ashamed of,
[3978.36 --> 3980.66]  how is that working for you?
[3982.00 --> 3983.44]  Did that really make you happy?
[3983.56 --> 3984.78]  Or did it actually lead to misery?
[3986.04 --> 3986.70]  And actually,
[3986.84 --> 3987.38]  he says,
[3987.44 --> 3989.48]  those things result in death.
[3989.48 --> 3991.90]  And so,
[3992.80 --> 3993.96]  think of the goldfish.
[3994.88 --> 3995.82]  Think of the goldfish.
[3996.56 --> 3997.30]  The goldfish
[3997.30 --> 3998.64]  swims around in a bowl,
[3999.44 --> 4000.38]  and he says,
[4000.78 --> 4001.00]  man,
[4001.06 --> 4002.16]  look at that world out there.
[4002.70 --> 4003.88]  I'm going to break free.
[4004.40 --> 4005.78]  I'm going to get out of here.
[4006.10 --> 4007.64]  This water is so restricting.
[4008.98 --> 4010.06]  But what happens
[4010.06 --> 4010.78]  when the goldfish
[4010.78 --> 4012.60]  makes the leap of a lifetime
[4012.60 --> 4015.08]  and goes outside the bowl?
[4017.32 --> 4017.94]  Paul says,
[4018.04 --> 4019.14]  what is the fruit of that?
[4019.86 --> 4021.18]  Where does that lead?
[4021.96 --> 4022.78]  And the answer is,
[4022.82 --> 4023.58]  it leads to death.
[4024.72 --> 4024.90]  Right?
[4024.92 --> 4026.16]  It always leads to death.
[4026.24 --> 4027.48]  That's what it looks like
[4027.48 --> 4028.42]  to be a slave to sin.
[4029.20 --> 4030.28]  But there's another way,
[4030.36 --> 4030.82]  Paul says,
[4030.86 --> 4031.62]  in verse 22.
[4032.88 --> 4034.20]  But now that you have been
[4034.20 --> 4035.32]  set free from sin,
[4035.40 --> 4036.98]  you have become slaves to God.
[4037.60 --> 4038.78]  The benefit you reap
[4038.78 --> 4039.54]  leads to holiness,
[4039.74 --> 4041.20]  and the result is eternal life.
[4042.38 --> 4042.50]  Right?
[4042.54 --> 4043.84]  So being a slave to God
[4043.84 --> 4046.32]  means you obey God.
[4046.48 --> 4047.90]  As you obey God,
[4048.02 --> 4049.06]  you grow in holiness.
[4049.06 --> 4050.88]  You become more and more
[4050.88 --> 4052.08]  like Christ.
[4052.24 --> 4053.18]  It's sanctification.
[4053.70 --> 4055.20]  And the end of that process,
[4055.40 --> 4056.12]  that way of life,
[4056.18 --> 4057.20]  leads to eternal life.
[4058.26 --> 4060.26]  That is the trajectory
[4060.26 --> 4062.62]  of being a slave to God.
[4063.62 --> 4064.48]  And then Paul ends
[4064.48 --> 4065.26]  in verse 23.
[4065.80 --> 4066.78]  For the wages of sin
[4066.78 --> 4067.24]  is death,
[4067.32 --> 4068.30]  but the gift of God
[4068.30 --> 4069.20]  is eternal life
[4069.20 --> 4070.52]  in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4071.36 --> 4072.48]  Romans 6, 23.
[4073.00 --> 4074.06]  It's a well-known verse.
[4074.06 --> 4075.60]  Many of us have memorized it.
[4075.64 --> 4076.28]  If you haven't,
[4076.72 --> 4077.26]  please do.
[4078.86 --> 4080.54]  It's a beautiful verse,
[4081.08 --> 4083.82]  but it's often used
[4083.82 --> 4084.48]  out of context,
[4084.56 --> 4085.16]  and that's fine,
[4085.26 --> 4086.56]  but it becomes
[4086.56 --> 4087.74]  even more beautiful
[4087.74 --> 4088.98]  when we read it
[4088.98 --> 4089.72]  and understand it
[4089.72 --> 4090.40]  in the context
[4090.40 --> 4091.12]  of all that we have
[4091.12 --> 4091.82]  just been saying.
[4093.12 --> 4093.30]  Right?
[4093.30 --> 4094.42]  And because the difference
[4094.42 --> 4096.32]  between sin as a master
[4096.32 --> 4097.72]  and Jesus as a master
[4097.72 --> 4100.22]  is that one gives you
[4100.22 --> 4102.62]  exactly what you deserve,
[4103.12 --> 4105.28]  and the other gives you
[4105.28 --> 4106.78]  what you don't deserve.
[4107.90 --> 4108.34]  Right?
[4108.42 --> 4109.68]  If sin is your master,
[4109.80 --> 4110.66]  at the end of the day,
[4110.72 --> 4111.68]  at the end of your life,
[4111.72 --> 4112.92]  you will receive
[4112.92 --> 4115.34]  the payment due to you,
[4115.44 --> 4116.00]  your wages,
[4116.12 --> 4116.56]  as it were.
[4116.56 --> 4118.82]  And what is the wages of sin?
[4120.00 --> 4120.48]  Death.
[4121.58 --> 4122.72]  The second death,
[4123.06 --> 4124.20]  as it says in Revelation,
[4124.36 --> 4125.28]  eternal death.
[4126.20 --> 4127.34]  But the other master,
[4127.48 --> 4127.76]  Jesus,
[4127.90 --> 4128.90]  if you submit to him,
[4128.94 --> 4130.12]  if you are under grace,
[4130.42 --> 4131.64]  he doesn't pay you in wages,
[4132.02 --> 4133.10]  he pays you with,
[4133.34 --> 4134.92]  he gives you a free gift.
[4136.22 --> 4137.00]  It's the gift
[4137.00 --> 4139.38]  that is free to us,
[4139.40 --> 4140.72]  but it is not free to God.
[4140.98 --> 4143.00]  It is extremely costly to God.
[4144.24 --> 4145.76]  It meant that God himself
[4145.76 --> 4147.58]  had to come and put on human flesh
[4147.58 --> 4149.22]  to come into the world
[4149.22 --> 4151.36]  to die as a human being,
[4151.54 --> 4152.66]  fully God and fully man,
[4152.72 --> 4153.48]  on the cross,
[4153.60 --> 4155.18]  to bear the responsibility
[4155.18 --> 4156.54]  for our failure
[4156.54 --> 4158.02]  to keep the law.
[4158.96 --> 4159.96]  And so on the cross,
[4160.02 --> 4160.84]  all the judgment
[4160.84 --> 4162.68]  that should fall on us
[4162.68 --> 4163.74]  as lawbreakers
[4163.74 --> 4165.84]  instead fell on our representative.
[4167.32 --> 4168.28]  And the obligation
[4168.28 --> 4169.80]  that we have as human beings
[4169.80 --> 4170.66]  to obey God
[4170.66 --> 4172.16]  and keep every law of God
[4172.16 --> 4174.32]  is accomplished by Jesus,
[4174.46 --> 4175.14]  our representative.
[4176.38 --> 4177.34]  And so that means
[4177.34 --> 4178.48]  you can have a relationship
[4178.48 --> 4179.08]  with God
[4179.08 --> 4179.92]  and it's not based
[4179.92 --> 4180.80]  on your performance
[4180.80 --> 4182.08]  or your law keeping.
[4183.34 --> 4184.34]  And it's not based
[4184.34 --> 4185.14]  because Jesus,
[4185.40 --> 4186.46]  God just loves everybody,
[4186.68 --> 4187.76]  but it is based
[4187.76 --> 4188.80]  on holding on
[4188.80 --> 4189.82]  to Jesus Christ
[4189.82 --> 4190.42]  and him alone.
[4191.66 --> 4193.02]  That is the way of grace.
[4193.14 --> 4193.86]  The gift of God
[4193.86 --> 4194.62]  is eternal life
[4194.62 --> 4195.30]  in Christ Jesus,
[4195.42 --> 4195.80]  our Lord.
[4197.42 --> 4198.04]  And so do you see
[4198.04 --> 4199.28]  what Paul is saying
[4199.28 --> 4200.84]  to try to get you
[4200.84 --> 4201.38]  and me
[4201.38 --> 4203.22]  to leave this life of sin?
[4203.22 --> 4206.02]  He's saying to us
[4206.02 --> 4206.46]  there's something
[4206.46 --> 4207.50]  so much better
[4207.50 --> 4208.56]  that is waiting for you.
[4209.80 --> 4211.22]  It is eternal life.
[4212.94 --> 4214.26]  So now as we close,
[4214.36 --> 4215.62]  let me ask you this question.
[4217.12 --> 4218.76]  It's kind of a theological quiz,
[4219.30 --> 4222.48]  but where is Jesus right now?
[4222.48 --> 4226.26]  This is Ascension Day, right?
[4226.38 --> 4227.06]  So what do we believe
[4227.06 --> 4227.76]  on Ascension Day?
[4227.88 --> 4229.20]  Jesus died on the cross,
[4229.26 --> 4230.06]  he rose again,
[4230.78 --> 4231.88]  he ascended into heaven,
[4231.96 --> 4232.88]  and where is he now?
[4232.98 --> 4233.50]  He is seated
[4233.50 --> 4234.12]  at the right hand
[4234.12 --> 4235.26]  of God the Father Almighty,
[4235.94 --> 4236.92]  as the creed says.
[4237.10 --> 4237.76]  He is sitting
[4237.76 --> 4238.74]  at the right hand of God.
[4238.74 --> 4241.78]  Actually, my daughter
[4241.78 --> 4242.78]  asked me the other day,
[4242.86 --> 4243.30]  what does it mean
[4243.30 --> 4243.96]  that Jesus sits
[4243.96 --> 4244.78]  at God's right hand,
[4244.86 --> 4245.44]  not his left?
[4248.80 --> 4249.50]  I'll leave that one
[4249.50 --> 4250.14]  for you to think about.
[4252.52 --> 4254.02]  But Jesus is on his throne,
[4254.14 --> 4255.60]  he is upholding all things
[4255.60 --> 4256.76]  by the word of his power,
[4258.68 --> 4260.16]  arranging all things
[4260.16 --> 4261.42]  according to his good purposes.
[4262.18 --> 4264.26]  He is also, more so,
[4264.42 --> 4266.14]  pleading our case
[4266.14 --> 4267.52]  before the Father,
[4267.52 --> 4269.12]  interceding for us.
[4269.74 --> 4270.62]  Jesus is in heaven,
[4271.12 --> 4272.64]  but where else is he?
[4273.44 --> 4275.40]  Because he is everywhere
[4275.40 --> 4276.32]  by his spirit.
[4277.68 --> 4278.52]  And so where else
[4278.52 --> 4279.64]  do we say that Jesus is?
[4279.70 --> 4280.72]  We say he is dwelling
[4280.72 --> 4281.76]  in my heart.
[4283.24 --> 4284.80]  He is dwelling in my heart,
[4285.16 --> 4286.54]  and that is true as well.
[4287.18 --> 4287.62]  And friends,
[4288.08 --> 4289.04]  that's what makes you
[4289.04 --> 4289.74]  his slave.
[4290.30 --> 4291.38]  That's what makes you
[4291.38 --> 4292.02]  his servant.
[4292.12 --> 4293.40]  Not only that he is in heaven,
[4294.12 --> 4295.20]  but that he is in you.
[4295.92 --> 4297.08]  Christ in you,
[4297.08 --> 4298.74]  the hope of glory.
[4300.12 --> 4301.92]  To be a slave of Jesus Christ
[4301.92 --> 4303.34]  simply means that you are
[4303.34 --> 4304.72]  obedient to the one
[4304.72 --> 4306.32]  who dwells in you,
[4306.50 --> 4307.60]  who lives in you,
[4308.02 --> 4308.94]  and who then gives you
[4308.94 --> 4309.44]  the power
[4309.44 --> 4311.22]  to obey him
[4311.22 --> 4312.86]  as a joyful
[4312.86 --> 4313.18]  slave
[4313.18 --> 4315.02]  of God.
[4316.02 --> 4316.80]  So let's pray.
[4316.96 --> 4317.48]  Let's ask for God
[4317.48 --> 4318.00]  to help us.
[4318.00 --> 4321.80]  Lord, our God,
[4321.92 --> 4323.36]  we thank you for Jesus,
[4324.34 --> 4325.00]  our Savior,
[4325.36 --> 4326.04]  our Lord,
[4326.74 --> 4327.46]  our Master.
[4328.90 --> 4329.86]  He came,
[4330.60 --> 4331.42]  and he lived,
[4331.48 --> 4332.08]  and he died,
[4332.16 --> 4333.08]  and he rose again,
[4333.16 --> 4334.04]  and he ascended
[4334.04 --> 4335.22]  upon high,
[4335.88 --> 4336.98]  and he pours out
[4336.98 --> 4338.32]  his Holy Spirit
[4338.32 --> 4339.44]  into our hearts
[4339.44 --> 4340.94]  so that while he is in heaven,
[4341.02 --> 4342.12]  he is also in us.
[4342.12 --> 4344.84]  And we pray that we may be
[4344.84 --> 4346.00]  obedient to him,
[4347.10 --> 4348.46]  leading to eternal life.
[4349.04 --> 4350.46]  We pray that we may have
[4350.46 --> 4351.52]  our eyes open
[4351.52 --> 4353.14]  to the deception
[4353.14 --> 4354.22]  of this world,
[4355.38 --> 4356.92]  of how our sin
[4356.92 --> 4357.68]  will ultimately
[4357.68 --> 4358.94]  not set us free,
[4359.00 --> 4359.96]  but crush us
[4359.96 --> 4361.94]  if we persist willingly
[4361.94 --> 4362.96]  in such a course.
[4364.00 --> 4364.34]  So Lord,
[4364.44 --> 4364.84]  keep us,
[4364.90 --> 4365.32]  we pray,
[4365.32 --> 4368.82]  in Christ,
[4369.70 --> 4370.72]  for Jesus' sake.
[4371.02 --> 4371.26]  Amen.
[4374.52 --> 4375.06]  All right.
[4375.18 --> 4376.40]  Let's feel free to stand
[4376.40 --> 4377.10]  as we prepare
[4377.10 --> 4377.86]  to sing
[4377.86 --> 4378.90]  our song of response.
[4395.32 --> 4396.32]  Amen.
[4396.32 --> 4397.32]  Amen.
[4397.32 --> 4398.32]  Amen.
[4398.32 --> 4398.36]  Amen.
[4398.36 --> 4398.38]  Amen.
[4398.38 --> 4398.46]  Amen.
[4412.46 --> 4412.54]  Amen.
[4412.54 --> 4416.36]  The gift of grace
[4416.36 --> 4417.86]  is Jesus,
[4418.24 --> 4420.42]  my Redeemer.
[4421.36 --> 4424.10]  There is no more
[4424.10 --> 4425.70]  for heaven
[4425.70 --> 4428.40]  now to give.
[4429.40 --> 4431.88]  He is my joy,
[4432.38 --> 4433.80]  my righteousness
[4433.80 --> 4435.86]  and freedom,
[4437.16 --> 4439.58]  my steadfast love,
[4440.06 --> 4443.62]  my deep and boundless peace.
[4444.74 --> 4447.36]  To this I hold,
[4447.36 --> 4451.16]  my hope is only Jesus.
[4451.16 --> 4455.08]  for my life
[4455.08 --> 4459.30]  His holy vow to live.
[4460.30 --> 4462.56]  Oh, how strange
[4462.56 --> 4464.08]  and divine
[4464.08 --> 4466.14]  I can sing.
[4466.50 --> 4468.46]  All is mine,
[4468.52 --> 4470.12]  yet not I,
[4470.38 --> 4472.86]  but through Christ
[4472.86 --> 4474.46]  in me.
[4474.46 --> 4486.14]  I am not forsaken,
[4486.14 --> 4489.94]  for by my side
[4489.94 --> 4491.48]  the Savior,
[4491.94 --> 4494.00]  He will stay.
[4495.00 --> 4497.72]  I labor on
[4497.72 --> 4499.28]  in weakness
[4499.28 --> 4501.66]  and rejoicing,
[4501.66 --> 4505.32]  for in my need
[4505.32 --> 4508.94]  His power is displayed.
[4509.94 --> 4513.14]  To this I hold,
[4513.14 --> 4517.86]  my shepherd will defend me.
[4517.86 --> 4522.46]  Through the deepest valley
[4522.46 --> 4525.06]  He will lead.
[4525.06 --> 4528.20]  for the night
[4528.20 --> 4530.08]  has been won,
[4530.46 --> 4532.04]  and I shall
[4532.04 --> 4533.52]  overcome
[4533.52 --> 4535.98]  yet not all
[4535.98 --> 4538.70]  but through Christ
[4538.70 --> 4539.98]  in me.
[4539.98 --> 4546.98]  no fate I dread.
[4546.98 --> 4551.74]  I know I am forgiven,
[4551.74 --> 4554.98]  the future's sure,
[4555.90 --> 4560.00]  the price it has been paid,
[4560.00 --> 4563.24]  for Jesus bled,
[4563.24 --> 4567.12]  and suffered for my pardon,
[4568.28 --> 4570.88]  and He was raised
[4570.88 --> 4575.04]  to overthrow the grave.
[4575.04 --> 4578.50]  To this I hold,
[4578.84 --> 4582.20]  my sin has been defeated,
[4582.20 --> 4587.52]  Jesus now and ever
[4587.52 --> 4590.46]  is my peace.
[4590.46 --> 4593.56]  For the chains
[4593.56 --> 4595.02]  are released,
[4595.42 --> 4597.02]  I am sin,
[4597.38 --> 4599.04]  I am free,
[4599.42 --> 4601.04]  yet not I,
[4601.36 --> 4603.68]  but through Christ
[4603.68 --> 4605.52]  in me.
[4605.52 --> 4612.82]  with every breath
[4612.82 --> 4615.22]  I long to follow
[4615.22 --> 4616.56]  Jesus
[4616.56 --> 4620.16]  For He has said
[4620.16 --> 4624.22]  that He will bring me home
[4624.22 --> 4627.70]  And day by day
[4627.70 --> 4632.00]  I know He will renew me
[4632.00 --> 4635.42]  until I stand
[4635.42 --> 4636.68]  with joy
[4636.68 --> 4639.30]  before the throne
[4639.30 --> 4642.92]  To this I hold
[4642.92 --> 4645.36]  My hope is only
[4645.36 --> 4646.74]  Jesus
[4646.74 --> 4650.98]  All the glory
[4650.98 --> 4653.78]  evermore to Him
[4653.78 --> 4657.92]  When the race
[4657.92 --> 4659.36]  is complete
[4659.36 --> 4661.38]  Still my lips
[4661.38 --> 4663.36]  shall repeat
[4663.36 --> 4665.40]  Yet not I
[4665.40 --> 4668.12]  but through Christ
[4668.12 --> 4669.60]  in me
[4669.60 --> 4673.68]  When the race
[4673.68 --> 4675.20]  is complete
[4675.20 --> 4677.32]  Still my lips
[4677.32 --> 4679.50]  shall repeat
[4679.50 --> 4681.86]  Yet not I
[4681.86 --> 4684.36]  but through Christ
[4684.36 --> 4686.78]  in me
[4686.78 --> 4689.96]  Yet not I
[4689.96 --> 4692.58]  but through Christ
[4692.58 --> 4694.92]  in me
[4694.92 --> 4706.96]  So in response to
[4706.96 --> 4708.46]  God's saving grace
[4708.46 --> 4710.14]  we have an opportunity
[4710.14 --> 4712.46]  each week to
[4712.46 --> 4714.78]  to give of our earthly
[4714.78 --> 4715.26]  possessions
[4715.26 --> 4716.52]  into His trustworthy
[4716.52 --> 4717.30]  hands
[4717.30 --> 4719.10]  And we do so
[4719.10 --> 4720.26]  in the freedom
[4720.26 --> 4722.16]  of Christ
[4722.16 --> 4723.08]  Which means
[4723.08 --> 4723.66]  we don't have to
[4723.66 --> 4724.34]  prove a thing
[4724.34 --> 4724.76]  We don't have to
[4724.76 --> 4725.52]  earn a thing
[4725.52 --> 4727.18]  God promises
[4727.18 --> 4728.04]  to grow His kingdom
[4728.04 --> 4728.74]  no matter what
[4728.74 --> 4730.48]  But what a joy
[4730.48 --> 4731.20]  it is
[4731.20 --> 4732.48]  to participate
[4732.48 --> 4733.10]  with Him
[4733.10 --> 4735.36]  in what He is doing
[4735.36 --> 4735.86]  in the world
[4735.86 --> 4736.98]  And so our
[4736.98 --> 4737.66]  designated offering
[4737.66 --> 4738.24]  for today
[4738.24 --> 4739.16]  is for
[4739.16 --> 4740.20]  Todd Statham
[4740.20 --> 4741.72]  in his ministry
[4741.72 --> 4742.90]  to UPC Okanagan
[4742.90 --> 4743.48]  He'll be coming
[4743.48 --> 4744.06]  to preach for us
[4744.06 --> 4744.72]  in a couple weeks
[4744.72 --> 4746.34]  And so may I
[4746.34 --> 4747.10]  invite the deacons
[4747.10 --> 4747.88]  to come forward
[4747.88 --> 4748.28]  and collect
[4748.28 --> 4748.94]  the morning offering
[4748.94 --> 4752.78]  and so may I
[4752.78 --> 4752.90]  shout now to you
[4752.90 --> 4757.52]  for Gilmore
[4757.52 --> 4775.28]  with you
[4775.28 --> 4777.28]  Amen.
[4805.28 --> 4807.28]  Amen.
[4835.28 --> 4837.28]  Amen.
[4865.28 --> 4867.28]  Amen.
[4895.28 --> 4897.40]  So let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[4901.06 --> 4911.20]  Ascended Christ, how grateful we are that you ever lived to intercede for us, even now at the Father's right hand.
[4911.50 --> 4913.30]  That means we can pray to you any time.
[4914.88 --> 4921.52]  We come to you, O Lord, because this world belongs to you, and because you are good and you are trustworthy,
[4921.52 --> 4926.04]  and because you invite us to come to your throne of grace with confidence.
[4927.16 --> 4931.08]  Lord, we pray for the work that Todd Statham is doing at UBC Okanagan.
[4932.38 --> 4935.52]  Lord, would you bless his ministry to university students?
[4936.28 --> 4946.30]  Would you help him provide, and would you provide relationships so that the students that he meets there on campus,
[4946.70 --> 4951.44]  the teachers that he interacts with, Lord, that they would be blessed through his ministry.
[4951.52 --> 4952.52]  And come to know you.
[4952.88 --> 4959.92]  We pray, Lord, that the love and truth of Christ would transform lives and hearts on college campuses.
[4961.08 --> 4963.88]  We pray, Lord, that you would provide all of his financial needs.
[4965.06 --> 4967.82]  Lord, we pray for other churches in our city of Ladner.
[4969.08 --> 4975.50]  Lord, would you strengthen all of the churches here in unity, in faith, hope, and love.
[4976.22 --> 4983.30]  Help us, Lord, to be a bright light for you in Ladner and in Delta, where you have placed us.
[4984.28 --> 4986.94]  Lord, we pray also for your work in our midst here.
[4987.92 --> 4996.98]  Lord, we pray that as individuals and families and as a church, that you would lead us and empower us to be good stewards of all that you have entrusted to us.
[4996.98 --> 5005.68]  Lord, we pray, Lord, that you would open doors and hearts, both here inside the church and outside of these walls, Lord, to the mystery of Christ.
[5005.68 --> 5019.34]  That you would enable us to declare and to proclaim Christ clearly, whether it's from the pulpit, in our Sunday school classrooms, in our other ministries, and, Lord, even with our neighbors.
[5021.14 --> 5031.28]  Heavenly Father, we thank you also for our denomination, the Christian Reformed Church, for all the ways that you have blessed us, for all the ministries that are being done to the very ends of the earth.
[5031.28 --> 5037.54]  We pray especially, Lord, for the upcoming work of Synod in just a couple weeks.
[5038.20 --> 5044.46]  We pray, Lord, for every delegate, that as they prepare, that you would work in them and that you'd work through them.
[5045.16 --> 5050.38]  Lord, be near to us in our committee meetings and deliberations and decisions.
[5051.66 --> 5057.34]  Help us, Lord, to obey from our hearts the pattern of teaching that has now claimed our allegiance.
[5057.34 --> 5061.76]  We thank and praise you, Lord, that you are the Lord of the church.
[5061.84 --> 5072.14]  Would you pour out your Holy Spirit on your church so that we may glorify you, that your kingdom may come, that your name may be lifted up, Lord, in our hearts and in our churches.
[5073.46 --> 5079.46]  Finally, Lord, we pray that you would comfort and heal all those who are battling illness and disease and injury.
[5079.46 --> 5085.98]  We pray, Lord, especially for Art Hoekstra, who was moved to hospice.
[5087.00 --> 5094.00]  Lord, would you be with him and strengthen him in his spirit, Lord, that he might lift up his heart, lift up his eyes to you.
[5094.54 --> 5100.68]  We pray, Lord, for Michael Wayne, that you would also be with him, Lord, that he might know you and your love for him.
[5101.68 --> 5104.44]  Would you, Lord, bring healing to both of these men?
[5104.44 --> 5114.92]  We pray, Lord, that you would comfort the family and friends of our brother, Ted Vanderhorst, as, Lord, you took him home to glory.
[5115.68 --> 5122.62]  We thank you, Lord, for the man that you have made him to be, for his witness to you amongst us as a church, amongst his family,
[5123.34 --> 5127.68]  and in the care home where you have placed him in the final years of his life.
[5127.68 --> 5131.92]  We pray, Lord, for all who mourn the loss of loved ones this morning.
[5133.40 --> 5137.18]  Also, we thank, Lord, of Lori Nichols, who lost her father.
[5138.18 --> 5139.36]  Lord, would you comfort them all.
[5140.42 --> 5142.26]  And we pray all this in Christ's name.
[5143.14 --> 5143.44]  Amen.
[5146.50 --> 5147.48]  So let's stand.
[5148.72 --> 5155.66]  And just a quick reminder is that after we sing our final song, please, members, stay here.
[5155.66 --> 5163.14]  You can have a seat again, and we will distribute the ballots for the affirming votes for our elders.
[5163.84 --> 5168.80]  And we'll invite our chair, Joe Shulk of Council, to come up and give us further instruction.
[5169.44 --> 5172.70]  But for now, I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5173.72 --> 5177.80]  May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him,
[5178.30 --> 5181.66]  so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[5182.28 --> 5182.62]  Amen.
[5182.62 --> 5185.86]  So let's remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[5185.86 --> 5186.02]  Amen.
[5200.40 --> 5206.30]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[5206.30 --> 5209.06]  I will praise him.
[5209.06 --> 5220.12]  He is exalted, forever exalted, and I will praise his name.
[5221.34 --> 5228.40]  He is the Lord, forever his truth shall reign.
[5228.40 --> 5236.98]  Heaven and earth, be dressed in his holy name.
[5236.98 --> 5242.64]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[5242.64 --> 5250.74]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[5250.74 --> 5253.02]  I will praise him.
[5253.02 --> 5263.70]  He is exalted, forever exalted, and I will praise his name.
[5263.70 --> 5264.70]  He is exalted.
[5264.70 --> 5273.84]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[5273.84 --> 5286.14]  He is exalted, the King is exalted on high.
[5286.14 --> 5295.64]  He is exalted on high.
[5295.64 --> 5298.38]  Jesús Re氏 Re sea.
[5298.38 --> 5299.70]  Amen.
[5299.70 --> 5329.68]  Thank you.
