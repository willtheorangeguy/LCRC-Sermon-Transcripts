[595.80 → 605.56] Good morning to you all.
[606.38 → 609.90] Thank you for joining us here this morning at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[609.90 → 615.94] My name is Jason True. I'm the lead pastor here, and it is my delight to welcome you this morning.
[616.56 → 624.40] If you are new or a visitor here with us this morning, you are our most welcome guest, and we are so happy that you are here.
[624.40 → 628.70] And we love to get to know you help you get connected with our congregation.
[629.38 → 641.04] Well today is a very special day because we are celebrating our 75th year together as a church 75 years of God's faithfulness to us.
[641.42 → 651.58] And so to make this day a little extra special we have a choir that will be singing and singing for us later conducted by Marian Mandrel.
[651.58 → 656.48] We have Roger Gross on piano, Catrina Day playing the cello.
[657.00 → 660.34] And we'll have different people also involved leading our worship service.
[660.48 → 663.84] So Serena Wong will be reading Psalm 150 for us later.
[664.50 → 667.42] Pat Using will be giving a children's message.
[667.86 → 670.16] Nick Lünen will be leading us in our community prayer.
[670.16 → 678.38] And all of us together serve one another as we pray, as we sing, as we worship God together.
[679.46 → 686.00] And so we're looking forward to a wonderful time of worship this morning in this day of celebration.
[686.00 → 693.62] And I'll also go ahead and say, before I forget, that yesterday we had a wonderful program.
[693.94 → 696.56] Lots of faces, new and old came.
[696.88 → 702.56] And we still have the displays from the three different eras of the church that are still set up.
[702.62 → 706.40] So there's one in the foyer, there's one in the fellowship hall, and one in the fireside room.
[706.40 → 714.32] So after the service, I invite you to go and, you know, explore and learn more about some of the different eras of our church.
[717.16 → 721.04] So let's begin our time of worship.
[721.48 → 726.26] And friends, we come with a conviction that God is at work.
[727.06 → 728.42] God is at work in this place.
[729.10 → 730.96] He's at work by the power of his Holy Spirit.
[730.96 → 734.82] He is at work in your presence here today.
[735.72 → 738.78] And he's at work in this time of worship that we have.
[738.92 → 743.50] He's at work through his word that is read and proclaimed through our prayers that are offered,
[744.28 → 748.30] through singing and praise through the Lord's Supper that we will celebrate later.
[749.16 → 753.74] And so let's begin this morning by hearing and responding to God's call to worship.
[754.24 → 756.74] This comes from several places in the scriptures.
[757.42 → 758.64] And we'll say it responsibly.
[758.64 → 766.02] Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
[767.28 → 772.20] Before the mountains were born, or you brought forth the whole world,
[772.66 → 776.70] from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[777.46 → 783.82] God is our refuge and strength and ever-present help in trouble.
[783.82 → 787.56] The Lord Almighty is with us.
[788.00 → 790.80] The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[792.00 → 795.54] Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed.
[796.06 → 798.08] For his compassions never fail.
[798.66 → 799.96] They are new every morning.
[800.44 → 802.46] Great is your faithfulness.
[803.46 → 804.56] Jesus said,
[804.56 → 806.76] I will build my church.
[806.76 → 810.58] The gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[811.58 → 814.04] Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[814.16 → 816.00] Let's come before our God in prayer.
[817.20 → 820.06] Father God, we worship you today.
[820.20 → 824.96] We gather together so that we can open our hearts before you.
[824.96 → 827.66] Oh, Lord, how we love you.
[828.62 → 831.58] And how grateful we are that you first loved us.
[832.40 → 834.20] Father, you have created us.
[835.04 → 839.04] And through you, we find our identity and our purpose.
[839.96 → 844.96] May we this morning grow in our understanding that you are our rock and our fortress.
[845.66 → 847.72] You are our creator and our redeemer.
[847.72 → 854.02] And that Jesus is building his church here at Latter CRC and around the world.
[854.88 → 860.02] All to the praise and glory of our God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[860.38 → 862.72] And it's in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[863.24 → 863.64] Amen.
[864.58 → 869.70] Let's stand together and receive God's greeting this morning.

[873.72 → 877.04] In the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

[1735.88 → 1738.88] O Lord, have mercy upon us.
[1738.88 → 1740.88] Spare all those who confess their faults.
[1740.88 → 1744.88] Restore all those who are penitent according to your promises,
[1744.88 → 1748.88] declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1748.88 → 1752.88] And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,
[1752.88 → 1756.88] that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life
[1756.88 → 1759.88] to the glory of your holy name.
[1759.88 → 1760.88] Amen.
[1762.88 → 1765.88] So friends, this is the table of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1765.88 → 1771.88] And isn't it a beautiful picture of what we are celebrating today?
[1771.88 → 1788.88] 75 years of being a church family gathered in God's words.
[1788.88 → 1798.88] And that we...
[1798.88 → 1803.88] So hear now these words of the institution that Jesus Christ himself spoke.
[1803.88 → 1806.88] The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed,
[1806.88 → 1809.88] he took bread, and when he had given thanks,
[1809.88 → 1810.88] he broke it and said,
[1810.88 → 1812.88] This is my body, which is for you.
[1812.88 → 1815.88] Do this in remembrance of me.
[1815.88 → 1819.88] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[1819.88 → 1822.88] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[1822.88 → 1827.88] For whenever you drink it, you do it in remembrance of me.
[1827.88 → 1831.88] For whenever you eat this bread, and you drink this cup,
[1831.88 → 1835.88] you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[1835.88 → 1841.88] Let's pray again together and ask for God's blessing upon this meal
[1841.88 → 1843.88] that we're about to enjoy together.
[1843.88 → 1848.88] Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you in praise and in adoration
[1848.88 → 1853.88] and in thanksgiving for your great faithfulness.
[1853.88 → 1858.88] Lord, you are faithful to come into our world,
[1858.88 → 1863.88] to take our sin in the darkness of the world upon yourself on the cross.
[1863.88 → 1867.88] You died, Lord, in our place so that we could be reconciled to our heavenly Father.
[1867.88 → 1873.88] Thank you, Lord, for the work of Christ on our behalf.
[1873.88 → 1880.88] And we now ask that your Holy Spirit would set apart this bread and this cup for your holy purposes,
[1880.88 → 1887.88] so that by receiving them by faith, our hearts would be united to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1887.88 → 1892.88] and united to one another as brothers and sisters by faith.
[1892.88 → 1896.88] Lord, would you bless this meal for the nourishment of your people.
[1896.88 → 1899.88] And we ask this in Christ's name. Amen.
[1899.88 → 1901.88] And let's say our communion liturgy.
[1901.88 → 1908.88] We lift them up to the Lord.
[1908.88 → 1910.88] We are his people.
[1910.88 → 1913.88] We are redeemed by his grace.
[1913.88 → 1915.88] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[1915.88 → 1917.88] Christ has died.
[1917.88 → 1919.88] Christ is risen.
[1919.88 → 1921.88] Christ will come again.
[1921.88 → 1924.88] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[1924.88 → 1925.88] Hallelujah.
[1925.88 → 1927.88] Hallelujah.
[1927.88 → 1931.88] Brothers and sisters, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[1931.88 → 1936.88] Take them and feast on him by faith with Thanksgiving,
[1936.88 → 1938.88] remembering that Christ died for you.
[1938.88 → 1943.88] May I ask our elders to come forward and to distribute the elements.
[1943.88 → 1944.88] Amen.
[1944.88 → 1946.88] Amen.
[1946.88 → 1948.88] Amen.
[1948.88 → 1950.88] Amen.
[1950.88 → 1952.88] Amen.
[1952.88 → 1954.88] Amen.
[1954.88 → 1955.88] Amen.
[1955.88 → 1956.88] Amen.
[1956.88 → 1957.88] Amen.
[1957.88 → 1958.88] Amen.
[1987.88 → 1989.88] Amen.
[2017.88 → 2018.88] Amen.

[2107.88 → 2109.88] Amen.
[2137.88 → 2139.88] Amen.
[2167.88 → 2169.88] Amen.
[2175.52 → 2178.46] Brothers and sisters, the body of Christ broken for you.
[2178.82 → 2179.46] Let's eat together.
[2197.88 → 2199.88] Amen.
[2227.88 → 2229.88] Amen.
[2257.88 → 2259.88] Amen.
[2287.88 → 2289.88] Amen.
[2289.88 → 2291.88] Amen.
[2291.88 → 2293.88] Amen.
[2293.88 → 2295.88] Amen.

[2297.88 → 2299.88] Amen.
[2299.88 → 2301.88] Amen.
[2301.88 → 2303.88] Amen.
[2303.88 → 2305.88] Amen.
[2305.88 → 2315.88] Behold Him there, the risen Lamb, my perfect flawless, satisfied.
[2315.88 → 2327.88] The great unchangeable I am, the King of glory and of race.
[2327.88 → 2332.88] One with His help I can all die.
[2332.88 → 2337.88] My soul is purchased by His pride.
[2337.88 → 2343.88] My love is filled with Christ on high.
[2343.88 → 2348.88] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[2348.88 → 2355.88] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[2355.88 → 2356.88] When He won.
[2356.88 → 2358.88] Be blessed with Christ for all the Lord.
[2358.88 → 2368.88] �
[2385.88 → 2387.88] Amen.
[2415.88 → 2437.82] Body of Christ, the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, shed for the remission of all your sins.
[2438.18 → 2438.90] Let's drink together.
[2445.88 → 2449.96] Would you join me in prayer?
[2451.72 → 2458.56] Our gracious Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2459.28 → 2468.34] that we, as needy and helpless sinners, have been rescued and redeemed and saved
[2468.34 → 2473.16] through the sacrifice, the sacrifice of love on the cross.
[2473.16 → 2479.52] And, Lord, we thank you that men, women, and children all around the world, even today,
[2479.66 → 2484.50] Lord, are being found and being brought into the family of God.
[2485.00 → 2491.48] We thank you, Lord, that you have brought each of us into that family, that by your amazing
[2491.48 → 2496.16] love that we have the privilege of being your children and knowing you as our Father.
[2496.16 → 2504.28] Lord, would you strengthen us, Lord, as we have eaten at your table, that we might follow
[2504.28 → 2506.28] you faithfully all of our days.
[2506.46 → 2507.58] We pray in Christ's name.
[2507.94 → 2508.14] Amen.
[2509.90 → 2515.96] Okay, so I'd like to invite the children to come up and sit here in front of Miss Pat,
[2515.96 → 2518.10] and she will have something to share with you.
[2518.10 → 2518.64] Thank you.
[2518.64 → 2519.80] Thank you.
[2545.96 → 2550.94] Hestia contact

[2558.18 → 2562.18] musicians
[2562.18 → 2565.02] Erik
[2565.02 → 2579.18] Thank you for doing that.
[2579.66 → 2580.76] Good morning to you.
[2580.76 → 2581.76] Good morning.
[2581.76 → 2588.34] I am so glad that you're here today and that you brought your parents with you
[2588.34 → 2594.34] because we come to church to learn about Jesus.
[2595.02 → 2601.86] Jesus has been very important in my life, and I've gone to church for a long time.
[2601.86 → 2608.84] When I was a little girl, my mom always made sure that I had my purse with me
[2608.84 → 2615.98] because in my purse, she always made sure that we had treats.
[2617.20 → 2620.64] And if you look at my treats, what are they?
[2621.86 → 2622.54] Cheerios.
[2622.90 → 2623.74] That's right.
[2623.74 → 2627.74] Because when they fell on the floor, they didn't make any noise.
[2628.66 → 2628.96] Okay?
[2630.20 → 2638.96] Also in my purse, my mom made sure I had a pencil and a piece of paper.
[2640.00 → 2646.14] And I could draw pictures, but I like to write my numbers.
[2646.14 → 2650.34] So I would write my numbers while the preacher was preaching.
[2650.82 → 2651.34] Okay?
[2651.60 → 2654.04] Because I had to sit very quietly.
[2654.96 → 2655.38] Okay?
[2656.32 → 2659.02] So that was a long time ago.
[2659.46 → 2661.24] You can see I'm old now.
[2661.40 → 2661.86] Right?
[2661.86 → 2663.86] I'm not a little child anymore.
[2663.86 → 2667.86] I brought with my something.
[2667.86 → 2671.12] I see, my parents, like 1, in myuca��er.
[2671.32 → 2672.08] I mean...
[2672.20 → 2672.74] So.
[2672.74 → 2678.82] My mom, if she wanted to talk to my grandmother, she would use this telephone.
[2678.82 → 2681.50] Is this what your telephone looks like today?
[2681.50 → 2682.50] No.
[2682.50 → 2685.56] What does your telephone look like?
[2685.56 → 2686.56] Yes.
[2686.56 → 2687.56] Market iPhone.
[2687.56 → 2688.56] Okay.
[2688.56 → 2690.56] And you even can see.
[2690.56 → 2691.56] Yeah.
[2691.56 → 2693.56] Can you put this in your pocket?
[2693.56 → 2694.56] Yeah.
[2694.56 → 2697.34] You think we can put this in our pocket?
[2697.34 → 2698.34] No.
[2698.34 → 2701.64] No, we can't put this in our pocket.
[2701.64 → 2705.48] This is very old, isn't it?
[2705.48 → 2706.52] It's a long time ago.
[2706.52 → 2708.34] We don't use this anymore.
[2708.34 → 2712.76] We can't even see somebody's face on it, can we?
[2712.76 → 2714.26] Okay.
[2714.26 → 2722.18] Do you know that we are celebrating a birthday this week?
[2722.18 → 2724.88] It's the birthday of our church.
[2724.88 → 2726.82] Okay.
[2726.82 → 2729.80] Which was a long time ago.
[2729.80 → 2733.50] So I want you to count with me.
[2733.50 → 2735.26] Got your hands up?
[2735.26 → 2736.26] Okay.
[2736.26 → 2737.26] Ready?
[2737.26 → 2757.98] 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 75.
[2757.98 → 2761.10] That's how old our church is.
[2761.10 → 2765.14] But we still gather to learn about Jesus.
[2765.14 → 2767.94] And I'm so glad you're here today.
[2767.94 → 2773.32] So you can go age three to grade one.
[2773.32 → 2776.68] You can go to your Sunday school classes at this time.
[2776.68 → 2779.32] All right then that's where you have to go.
[2779.32 → 2782.88] All right.
[2782.88 → 2783.84] Thank you.
[2783.90 → 2786.74] Thank you.
[2786.74 → 2791.38] Go to your graduation.
[2791.38 → 2791.50] Okay.
[2791.50 → 2792.86] Yeah.
[2792.86 → 2793.70] You can go to your university.
[2793.70 → 2796.72] Assuming HAVE ponies this week to college in Texas.
[2796.72 → 2797.30] Okay?
[2797.30 → 2827.28] Thank you.
[2827.30 → 2828.82] Okay, so good morning again.
[2832.14 → 2840.58] So this morning, as we celebrate our 75 years, I hope you were counting along, as a church,
[2840.86 → 2846.66] I want to consider together this morning what it means to be a congregation.
[2847.66 → 2849.98] What does it mean to be a church?
[2850.06 → 2852.54] What does it mean to be the family of Christ?
[2852.54 → 2858.14] And to help us do that, we're going to turn to Paul's letter to the Philippians.
[2858.76 → 2861.46] And I invite you to turn there in your Bibles with me.
[2861.96 → 2863.82] We will look at Philippians chapter 1.
[2867.64 → 2873.66] That is on page 872 of your Pew Bible, page 872.
[2873.66 → 2881.34] And we'll read Philippians chapter 1, verses 3 to 8.
[2881.34 → 2889.16] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2889.16 → 2893.86] I thank my God every time I remember you.
[2894.52 → 2900.42] In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in
[2900.42 → 2903.68] the gospel from the first day until now.
[2904.46 → 2909.98] Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion
[2909.98 → 2912.00] until the day of Christ Jesus.
[2912.00 → 2917.28] It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart.
[2917.90 → 2924.78] For whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's
[2924.78 → 2925.68] grace with me.
[2926.40 → 2933.36] God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[2934.22 → 2935.46] This is the word of the Lord.
[2936.22 → 2936.54] Amen.
[2938.34 → 2939.30] So let's pray.
[2939.30 → 2939.32] Let's pray.
[2939.74 → 2947.40] Let's ask God for his blessing upon his word as we hear it read and preached this morning.
[2947.52 → 2947.86] Let's pray.
[2948.56 → 2953.38] Father, we thank you again this morning for your word, which is absolutely true and given
[2953.38 → 2954.18] to us in love.
[2954.94 → 2959.72] And as we come to your word this morning, we ask that the words of my mouth, the meditations
[2959.72 → 2964.90] of all of our hearts would be acceptable and pleasing in your sight.
[2965.36 → 2968.50] Oh Lord, our rock and our redeemer.
[2968.50 → 2971.08] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[2971.50 → 2971.82] Amen.
[2973.74 → 2979.42] So, I have been given the controller.
[2980.36 → 2982.02] So, we will see how this goes.
[2982.16 → 2983.04] This is my first time.
[2984.16 → 2985.74] Well, in a long time at least.
[2987.02 → 2987.26] Okay.
[2987.26 → 2987.30] Okay.
[2989.18 → 2995.88] So, what I want to do this morning is draw our attention to one word, really, actually
[2995.88 → 2999.88] one phrase, and it is in verse 5.
[3001.16 → 3001.36] Okay.
[3001.56 → 3008.20] So, Paul writes, in all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your
[3008.20 → 3012.62] partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
[3012.62 → 3024.62] So, in this verse, Paul refers to his relationship with these Christians in Philippi as having
[3024.62 → 3026.58] a partnership in the gospel.
[3026.70 → 3027.78] That's how he talks about them.
[3029.18 → 3030.54] A partnership in the gospel.
[3030.54 → 3037.72] And I want to introduce you to the actual ancient Greek word for this because Paul didn't write
[3037.72 → 3040.28] the letter of the Philippians in English.
[3040.54 → 3041.66] He wrote it in Greek.
[3042.28 → 3047.86] And that word translated partnership is the Greek word Livonia.
[3048.92 → 3052.02] Livonia, partnership in the gospel.
[3052.02 → 3057.06] It's a wonderful word that I think every single Christian should know.
[3058.02 → 3058.18] Okay.
[3058.26 → 3064.14] Every Christian should know this word because it is so important to what it means to belong
[3064.14 → 3066.92] to a fellowship of believers.
[3068.10 → 3073.30] And so, this morning, what I want to do is just describe four different aspects or four
[3073.30 → 3080.32] different facets or definitions of this word Livonia because that is what Paul does in
[3080.32 → 3081.28] these verses.
[3081.28 → 3085.66] He describes what it means to have a partnership in the gospel.
[3086.38 → 3088.16] So, what is Livonia?
[3088.58 → 3091.34] What is partnership in the gospel?
[3092.28 → 3098.24] Well, the first thing, the first aspect of this, it means being teammates.
[3099.40 → 3099.54] Okay.
[3099.56 → 3103.56] I'm not sure if they had the word teammate back in Paul's day.
[3104.06 → 3108.02] But today, I think we would use the word teammate.
[3108.82 → 3108.96] Right.
[3108.96 → 3113.40] And so, you know, actually teammates make the best friends.
[3114.18 → 3118.98] Because if you're on a team with someone, if you're teammates with someone, that friendship
[3118.98 → 3123.18] arises out of sharing in a larger purpose together.
[3123.18 → 3129.76] And so, when I think back, when I was a teenager, some of my best friends back in that day were
[3129.76 → 3131.28] from being on a sports team together.
[3131.28 → 3136.96] Because those are guys that I went through, you know, long, exhausting practices with.
[3136.96 → 3137.96] We played together.
[3137.96 → 3141.60] We played together against other teams.
[3141.60 → 3145.18] We had to work together for a common purpose.
[3145.18 → 3147.94] And friendships arise from that.
[3147.94 → 3155.68] And that was where friendship and partnership was formed in this common purpose of being
[3155.68 → 3156.32] a team together.
[3156.32 → 3157.48] Pursuing a common goal.
[3157.92 → 3160.12] And that's the way Paul sees the church.
[3161.32 → 3161.58] Right.
[3161.64 → 3162.34] As a team.
[3162.54 → 3163.82] Working together.
[3164.06 → 3165.28] Doing ministry together.
[3165.28 → 3167.38] They're all with a common purpose.
[3167.50 → 3168.20] A common goal.
[3168.76 → 3170.32] Of seeking the kingdom of God.
[3170.40 → 3171.32] Of following Jesus.
[3171.48 → 3174.38] Of bearing witness to the resurrected Christ.
[3175.28 → 3179.08] And so, Paul did not see himself as the gospel worker.
[3179.64 → 3182.94] And the Philippian church as the gospel receivers.
[3183.50 → 3186.12] He saw them as teammates.
[3186.12 → 3188.72] Co-workers in the gospel.
[3188.72 → 3194.74] And he says, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel.
[3195.00 → 3201.04] From the first day, the day when he first landed in Philippi, until now.
[3202.02 → 3206.76] Paul is rejoicing because they are teammates in the gospel with him.
[3207.76 → 3213.86] I once heard about a man in the UK who was talking about how he ended up becoming a pastor.
[3213.86 → 3217.32] He was working as a barrister.
[3217.94 → 3220.12] Or, as we would say here, a lawyer.
[3221.22 → 3224.32] And he would kind of go to church on Sundays.
[3224.54 → 3225.26] He was a believer.
[3225.44 → 3227.06] But he would kind of just sit in the back.
[3227.32 → 3228.38] Not really too involved.
[3229.60 → 3234.26] Then one Sunday, someone in the church came and said, hey, we need you to help.
[3234.96 → 3236.82] Can you be in charge of the coffee station?
[3237.28 → 3239.86] Serving coffee after the service.
[3240.86 → 3242.32] And he thought, me?
[3242.72 → 3243.02] Coffee?
[3243.86 → 3244.26] No.
[3244.58 → 3245.64] I don't want to do that at all.
[3246.20 → 3247.88] I am a barrister, not a barista.
[3248.98 → 3250.42] And he was quite put out.
[3251.40 → 3253.68] But being British, he didn't know how to decline.
[3253.90 → 3254.58] So he said yes.
[3256.58 → 3261.44] And so the next Sunday, he goes, and he starts serving coffee and getting involved.
[3261.44 → 3266.94] And he says, you know, as I started serving coffee, the most amazing thing happened.
[3266.94 → 3277.28] As I stood there Sunday after Sunday, just handing cups of coffee to people, I began to fall in love with the church.
[3277.28 → 3279.70] I began to see how special.
[3279.70 → 3281.96] I began to see how special the church is.
[3281.96 → 3282.74] I began to see how special the church is.
[3282.74 → 3290.52] These people from all kinds of different walks of life, different backgrounds, different experiences, who are brought together by God's grace.
[3290.52 → 3293.36] And he said, God did something inside of me.
[3293.36 → 3298.44] I began to love the church so much that I changed my whole career.
[3299.08 → 3304.16] I wanted to give myself to the people that God was at work in.
[3304.16 → 3309.74] Now, I'm not saying that if you start serving the church, you will become a pastor.
[3310.88 → 3318.32] But this is a picture of what the New Testament calls the priesthood of all believers.
[3318.98 → 3323.42] That's one of the truths of scripture that was recovered in the Reformation.
[3324.24 → 3325.48] The priesthood of all believers.
[3325.90 → 3331.38] All of us are called to be teammates in the gospel, to get involved, to work together.
[3331.38 → 3335.76] And it's what fills the apostle with great joy.
[3335.96 → 3342.38] He rejoices as he writes this letter to the Philippian church because he's writing to his teammates.
[3343.54 → 3346.92] So that's the first aspect of Livonia, being teammates with one another.
[3347.64 → 3353.10] The second aspect of Livonia is hope for each other.
[3353.84 → 3357.46] Not only being teammates, but having hope for each other.
[3358.06 → 3360.54] Never giving up on each other.
[3360.54 → 3363.60] And the way Paul describes this is in verse 6.
[3363.92 → 3364.52] We'll have it here.
[3365.08 → 3365.60] He says,
[3365.80 → 3372.96] Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
[3373.78 → 3378.24] So in other words, the work that God has started in each one of us individually,
[3379.02 → 3384.12] and in us together as a church, God is not going to give up on that work.
[3384.12 → 3384.62] Right?
[3384.62 → 3393.94] God always finishes the work that he starts in this world, in this church, in Christians' lives, and throughout the whole of creation.
[3394.94 → 3400.50] And I think this is so deeply important because it is so easy to give up on one another.
[3400.50 → 3401.50] Right?
[3401.50 → 3402.50] Right?
[3402.50 → 3410.04] If you spend any time in a church, you'll know that some point along the way, it can be very tempting to have a moment of discouragement.
[3410.46 → 3414.48] Where you think, these people are never going to change.
[3414.48 → 3418.56] This church is never going to change.
[3419.26 → 3420.84] Maybe I am never going to change.
[3422.34 → 3426.36] Sometimes the work of God in our lives or in our church seems so slow.
[3427.44 → 3429.60] Sometimes it just seems stuck.
[3429.60 → 3436.02] And what Paul is doing is he is bringing some gospel hope to us.
[3436.48 → 3439.42] And he's saying, oh, the story is not over.
[3440.76 → 3440.92] Okay?
[3441.00 → 3446.06] God has begun a good work in us individually and as a church.
[3447.06 → 3448.60] But he is not finished yet.
[3448.92 → 3450.60] We are a work in progress.
[3451.72 → 3455.38] And because we're not finished, it's easy to get discouraged.
[3455.38 → 3460.46] When you see a project half done, and you say, this thing is not working out, how is this going to be finished?
[3460.62 → 3464.14] You know, you may experience this at work or in other things you do in life.
[3464.22 → 3467.28] You say, you can get discouraged.
[3468.02 → 3469.12] And we can give up.
[3469.74 → 3474.82] But to be the church, to be partners in the gospel, means that we never do that.
[3475.14 → 3476.72] We never give up on one another.
[3477.40 → 3481.32] We never give up on what God is doing in us.
[3482.04 → 3483.96] We always have hope for each other.
[3485.38 → 3488.16] Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Lutheran pastor in Germany.
[3488.68 → 3493.48] He wrote a wonderful book about the church called Life Together.
[3493.82 → 3496.08] I highly recommend it to all of us.
[3497.28 → 3501.36] I want to share something that he writes in this book, Life Together.
[3501.90 → 3503.92] I mean, when I read it, I underlined the whole thing.
[3504.08 → 3506.90] It's almost, I've got to get a new copy.
[3507.54 → 3508.42] But this is what he says.
[3508.42 → 3515.96] If we do not give thanks daily for the Christian fellowship in which we have been placed,
[3516.72 → 3526.14] even where there is no great experience, no discoverable riches, but much weakness, small faith, and difficulty.
[3526.14 → 3533.96] If on the contrary, we only keep complaining to God that everything is so paltry and petty.
[3534.48 → 3535.02] I love that.
[3535.52 → 3536.32] Paltry and petty.
[3537.28 → 3539.40] So far from what we expected.
[3540.06 → 3547.42] If we do all this, then we hinder God from letting our fellowship grow according to the measure and riches
[3547.42 → 3551.32] which are there for us all in Jesus Christ.
[3554.48 → 3561.02] So what I hear Bonhoeffer saying is that if we complain to God about the fellowship that God has put us into
[3561.02 → 3564.22] because of how petty and paltry it all seems,
[3564.50 → 3568.02] we are actually hindering our church from growing.
[3568.02 → 3575.24] And he also has a word for pastors to not complain about their church.
[3576.82 → 3582.16] So instead, we are to give thanks to God because God actually can change you.
[3582.82 → 3585.30] God actually can change his church.
[3585.40 → 3586.22] People do change.
[3586.96 → 3592.96] And we will only grow as a church according to the measure and the riches which are available to us in Christ
[3592.96 → 3597.22] as we hope for ourselves and as we hope for each other.
[3598.02 → 3598.82] Right?
[3598.90 → 3604.18] Because the way we grow in the grace of God is in connection and community with one another.
[3605.06 → 3605.28] Right?
[3605.36 → 3609.94] And so you and I, we were each made right with God one by one.
[3610.98 → 3616.20] But we need the Christian community for our growth and our progress in the Christian life.
[3617.38 → 3621.90] And so when we come together, it's like we are these precious gems.
[3622.50 → 3624.76] You know, a precious gem, a ruby, a sapphire, whatever.
[3624.76 → 3630.64] And with all sorts of rough edges where we're kind of, you know, uncut gems.
[3630.96 → 3636.50] And God tosses us together into the church, which is kind of like a tumbler, right?
[3636.60 → 3640.94] And it turns over and over and our sharp edges get knocked off.
[3641.08 → 3648.54] And we are polished, and we are smoothed until Jesus himself can see his reflection in us.
[3648.54 → 3655.50] Friends, God is doing his work here at Latin or CRC.
[3656.32 → 3659.40] And so we should have hope for ourselves, and we should have hope for one another.
[3659.40 → 3662.86] So now to the next one.
[3663.96 → 3667.52] The third aspect of Livonia is bearing each other's burdens.
[3668.54 → 3672.82] Okay, Livonia, partnership in the gospel, means bearing each other's burdens.
[3673.52 → 3674.76] So look with me at verse 7.
[3676.10 → 3677.72] In verse 7, Paul writes this.
[3677.72 → 3683.44] It is right for me to feel this way about all of you since I have you in my heart.
[3683.82 → 3690.88] And whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.
[3692.00 → 3696.50] Now notice that really wonderful little phrase that Paul has there at the end of the verse.
[3697.08 → 3700.12] All of you share in God's grace with me.
[3701.50 → 3705.98] What does it mean to be a sharer in grace?
[3705.98 → 3711.14] What does it mean to be a sharer in grace?
[3711.82 → 3716.34] Well, it means at the very least that you need grace, right?
[3716.60 → 3718.34] That you have received grace.
[3718.76 → 3722.32] And to receive grace, to need grace, is to need help.
[3723.88 → 3725.54] All of us need help.
[3725.60 → 3727.92] We've all received the grace of God together.
[3728.42 → 3730.56] And the thing is, Paul needed help.
[3731.30 → 3733.92] When Paul is writing this letter, where is he?
[3733.92 → 3735.98] He's in prison.
[3736.14 → 3737.46] He's in prison in Rome.
[3738.22 → 3748.18] And when you are imprisoned in Rome, whether in a jail cell, in chains, or whether maybe more likely in this instance for Paul, under house arrest,
[3749.30 → 3751.92] either way, they don't take care of you.
[3752.66 → 3753.82] They don't feed you.
[3754.24 → 3755.72] They don't give you water.
[3756.36 → 3757.92] They don't clothe you.
[3757.92 → 3762.14] So if you're arrested in Canada, what happens?
[3762.82 → 3764.60] You become a ward of the state.
[3765.02 → 3767.82] The government becomes responsible for keeping you alive.
[3768.86 → 3769.68] My retirement plan.
[3770.96 → 3771.68] I'm just kidding.
[3771.68 → 3777.20] But not so in the Roman Empire in the first century.
[3777.66 → 3790.24] If you are arrested and thrown into prison, the only way you can survive is if people who love you and care about you visit you and bring you food and bring you water and bring you warm clothes.
[3791.24 → 3792.32] Paul is in prison.
[3792.72 → 3793.94] He can't help himself.
[3794.60 → 3795.86] He is not self-sufficient.
[3795.86 → 3798.62] And so he writes letters asking for help.
[3799.64 → 3800.64] And who responded?
[3801.82 → 3803.46] The Philippian church responded.
[3804.32 → 3809.14] They sent money to Paul so that he could have all of his needs provided for while he was in jail.
[3809.28 → 3810.92] Paul received their support.
[3812.18 → 3818.14] Paul needed the Philippian church to co-bear his burden with him.
[3818.80 → 3820.64] And they were glad to do it.
[3820.64 → 3821.04] Right?
[3821.80 → 3828.66] Paul had borne their burdens with them when he lived and laboured among them as their pastor.
[3829.62 → 3833.48] And then he had gone off to preach the gospel, to plant other churches.
[3833.88 → 3840.62] And now when they heard he was in need, they were glad for the opportunity to bear his burden in return.
[3842.10 → 3843.70] Take a look at this painting.
[3845.14 → 3846.16] It's kind of funny.
[3846.16 → 3851.72] The name of this is Holy Livonia.
[3852.62 → 3856.20] It hangs on a wall in a monastery in Italy.
[3856.62 → 3862.18] And it is there to remind the brothers of the monastery that they are to do this for each other.
[3862.96 → 3864.74] They are to carry each other.
[3865.16 → 3867.54] They are to bear each other's burdens.
[3869.42 → 3870.92] Now let me ask you a question.
[3871.32 → 3872.74] Which guy would you rather be?
[3872.74 → 3876.40] Getting a piggyback ride?
[3877.44 → 3877.64] No.
[3877.90 → 3882.22] Well, I mean, would you rather be needed?
[3883.36 → 3885.02] Would you rather feel important?
[3885.88 → 3887.50] Know that you are helping someone?
[3887.68 → 3890.38] Be the one who is strong enough to carry someone else?
[3890.54 → 3892.16] Or would you rather be needy?
[3893.20 → 3894.64] And have to ask for help?
[3895.20 → 3896.62] And be dependent on others?
[3896.62 → 3900.66] Well, I think we'd all rather be needed, right?
[3901.12 → 3904.54] You'd rather be the one to give help, not the one to receive it.
[3905.52 → 3908.72] I guess we'd all rather be needed.
[3909.64 → 3914.18] But part of what it means to bear each other's burdens is to allow ourselves to be needy.
[3914.94 → 3915.06] Right?
[3915.32 → 3918.84] And to allow ourselves to be helped, like Paul does here.
[3918.84 → 3921.56] It's actually hard to do.
[3922.66 → 3924.06] Because it requires humility.
[3925.68 → 3926.94] But isn't it, you know, think about this.
[3927.04 → 3936.72] Isn't it a privilege when someone allows us, when someone else allows you to help them carry their burden with them?
[3936.76 → 3937.64] Isn't that a privilege?
[3938.46 → 3940.22] To be able to help someone else.
[3940.64 → 3940.80] Right?
[3940.86 → 3942.32] To provide them support.
[3942.48 → 3943.42] To care for them.
[3943.42 → 3947.36] But if you never ask for help, right?
[3947.40 → 3950.80] If you never let yourself be helped, what happens?
[3950.90 → 3953.08] Well, you rob that blessing of someone else.
[3954.10 → 3959.60] In a sense, you rob the blessing of holy Livonia from one another.
[3960.26 → 3964.24] And you rob each other of the opportunity to be a sharer in grace.
[3964.64 → 3965.56] To be a sharer.
[3965.66 → 3967.48] To put grace into practice.
[3969.02 → 3971.60] So friends, part of what it means to be the church together
[3971.60 → 3974.04] is to bear each other's burdens.
[3974.08 → 3978.86] Not only by helping one another, but by allowing yourself to be helped.
[3979.40 → 3981.78] So that we can be sharers in grace together.
[3982.82 → 3985.84] Now lastly, Livonia.
[3986.12 → 3987.28] Partnership in the gospel.
[3987.98 → 3990.04] It's about loving each other in Christ.
[3990.58 → 3990.70] Right?
[3990.74 → 3992.02] So it's not only about being a teammate.
[3992.72 → 3993.70] Being on the same team.
[3994.42 → 3995.46] Working toward a common vision.
[3995.84 → 3997.54] It's not only having a hope for each other.
[3997.60 → 3999.14] That God is at work among us.
[3999.14 → 4002.74] And it's not only bearing each other's burdens and helping one another.
[4002.94 → 4004.16] It's also about love.
[4005.48 → 4008.08] So in verse 8, Paul says this.
[4008.74 → 4016.16] God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[4017.70 → 4019.56] It's a beautiful thing to write in a letter.
[4019.56 → 4022.22] He's saying to them,
[4022.92 → 4024.04] I love you guys.
[4024.64 → 4025.56] I miss you.
[4026.08 → 4027.42] I wish I was with you.
[4028.06 → 4029.82] I carry you in my heart.
[4030.26 → 4030.48] Right?
[4030.54 → 4032.10] He just kind of lays it on.
[4032.46 → 4033.72] How much he loves them.
[4033.80 → 4035.12] How much he cares for them.
[4036.70 → 4039.76] In this letter, Paul is not being detached.
[4040.20 → 4041.30] He is being personal.
[4041.88 → 4042.84] He is being passionate.
[4042.84 → 4049.72] But what I find most challenging about this verse is the fact that he says,
[4050.72 → 4051.46] All of you.
[4052.94 → 4054.02] Do you see that there?
[4054.48 → 4058.90] How I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[4059.84 → 4063.00] Now, I have been part of a few churches over the years.
[4063.00 → 4066.18] And I have found that both for myself and for others,
[4066.48 → 4069.54] that not everybody loves everybody else in the church.
[4070.32 → 4073.66] We love some people in the church, perhaps more than others.
[4074.04 → 4074.46] Right?
[4074.54 → 4075.02] Isn't that true?
[4075.32 → 4076.06] We can be honest.
[4076.92 → 4079.22] Nobody loves everybody in the church.
[4079.78 → 4081.18] So what's going on here?
[4081.30 → 4082.82] Is Paul exaggerating?
[4083.74 → 4084.76] I don't think so.
[4085.54 → 4090.10] I think Paul actually really means what he says.
[4090.20 → 4091.34] I don't think he's exaggerating.
[4091.34 → 4096.30] Even though there were at least a few characters in the church in Philippi
[4096.30 → 4098.92] who Paul maybe had reasons not to love.
[4099.58 → 4099.70] Right?
[4099.76 → 4101.18] If you read the rest of the letter,
[4101.64 → 4104.74] Paul refers to people in the church who are stirring up trouble for him.
[4105.84 → 4109.78] He has to tell the church to do everything without grumbling,
[4110.36 → 4112.88] presumably because there were people grumbling.
[4114.08 → 4118.72] He had to plead with two leaders in the church to get along,
[4118.72 → 4119.96] to be reconciled.
[4121.34 → 4123.46] So how can he say,
[4124.30 → 4126.94] I have affection with all of you?
[4126.98 → 4130.88] And clearly there were people who are maybe not very lovable.
[4132.10 → 4135.08] And I think the answer there is in verse 8,
[4135.18 → 4135.88] where he says,
[4136.00 → 4141.50] I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[4142.78 → 4143.22] Right?
[4143.22 → 4143.74] In other words,
[4143.78 → 4149.22] the power to love absolutely everybody in the church comes not from ourselves,
[4149.78 → 4151.24] but it comes from the love of Jesus.
[4152.08 → 4153.44] So it goes like this.
[4153.48 → 4155.16] I recognize that Jesus loves you.
[4155.42 → 4157.10] You recognize that Jesus loves me.
[4157.34 → 4162.28] And then there is a conduit of love where we can love one another
[4162.28 → 4164.94] because of the love of Christ,
[4165.02 → 4167.16] even when we might naturally not get along.
[4167.16 → 4170.12] But we love one another in Christ.
[4171.32 → 4171.76] Now,
[4172.00 → 4173.72] when we think about the church in Philippi,
[4173.88 → 4175.26] in Acts chapter 16,
[4175.34 → 4175.90] a different book,
[4176.04 → 4177.08] Acts chapter 16,
[4177.36 → 4179.60] we read about how Paul and Silas and Timothy,
[4179.84 → 4183.40] they go to Philippi for the first time to plant a church there.
[4183.40 → 4184.88] And if you remember,
[4185.36 → 4188.46] who were the first converts in the city of Philippi?
[4189.08 → 4190.04] There were three people.
[4190.66 → 4190.96] Lydia,
[4191.74 → 4194.32] a wealthy businesswoman who sells purple cloth,
[4195.08 → 4198.34] a slave girl who is freed from demonic oppression,
[4198.92 → 4204.16] and a Roman prison guard who converts and brings his whole family to faith in Christ.
[4205.50 → 4206.52] So question,
[4207.20 → 4209.36] what do these three people have in common?
[4209.36 → 4214.56] What natural affinity do they have with one another?
[4214.64 → 4215.22] A wealthy,
[4215.48 → 4216.58] white-collar businesswoman,
[4217.54 → 4218.56] a slave girl,
[4219.36 → 4221.18] and a blue-collar Roman jailer?
[4222.14 → 4224.42] Do they have like a shared culture?
[4225.52 → 4226.04] No.
[4227.20 → 4228.50] What do they have?
[4229.58 → 4230.72] They have the gospel.
[4231.20 → 4232.36] They have the gospel in common.
[4232.46 → 4237.42] They have the love that they have received from Jesus in common with one another,
[4237.60 → 4238.48] and it was enough.
[4238.48 → 4242.14] That's all they need to be a church,
[4242.14 → 4244.16] where in all the rest of society,
[4244.30 → 4246.42] they would never be with one another,
[4246.58 → 4247.30] but in Christ,
[4247.46 → 4248.58] they gather together.
[4249.36 → 4251.24] It was enough to plant a new church.
[4253.02 → 4253.60] Jesus said,
[4253.72 → 4255.36] they'll know that you're my disciples.
[4255.96 → 4256.18] How?
[4257.58 → 4259.66] If you love one another.
[4260.88 → 4263.12] So Livonia means loving the whole church,
[4263.16 → 4264.36] not because you like everyone,
[4264.64 → 4266.04] not because you agree with everyone,
[4266.04 → 4268.92] not because you have a natural affinity with everyone,
[4269.16 → 4273.20] but because you recognize that Jesus loves everybody in the church,
[4273.52 → 4274.24] including you.
[4274.24 → 4279.72] That's how churches become unlikely places of love.
[4280.78 → 4281.40] So friends,
[4281.46 → 4283.70] that's the picture that Paul gives us here
[4283.70 → 4286.16] of what it looks like to be the church.
[4286.98 → 4291.18] As we think about God's faithfulness to us over 75 years
[4291.18 → 4292.88] and how he will continue to be faithful,
[4293.38 → 4296.52] this is the picture that I think we can keep in mind.
[4296.52 → 4299.00] That we are teammates side by side,
[4299.16 → 4300.28] serving in ministry,
[4300.70 → 4301.90] seeking the kingdom of God.
[4303.00 → 4304.56] That we have hope for each other
[4304.56 → 4307.32] because God is going to finish the work that he starts.
[4308.14 → 4310.54] That we are willing to bear each other's burdens
[4310.54 → 4314.08] and we love each other in and through the love of Christ.
[4315.22 → 4317.54] And all of that is captured by this one word,
[4317.66 → 4317.80] what?
[4319.22 → 4319.66] Livonia.
[4319.66 → 4319.78] Livonia.
[4320.98 → 4321.50] Now,
[4321.62 → 4322.68] is this easy to do?
[4325.28 → 4325.78] No.
[4326.70 → 4327.18] No.
[4327.78 → 4328.82] Not for a minute.
[4329.22 → 4329.34] Right?
[4329.44 → 4331.54] If this was left to our own strength,
[4331.82 → 4332.76] where if Jesus said,
[4333.16 → 4333.64] I'm out,
[4334.02 → 4335.12] you guys build,
[4335.26 → 4336.10] do the church thing,
[4336.54 → 4338.34] it would have just failed immediately.
[4338.58 → 4340.76] It would never would have been 2,000 years
[4340.76 → 4342.68] of the miracle of God's grace
[4342.68 → 4345.26] in calling people and bringing them together.
[4345.26 → 4347.92] We can never do it on our own,
[4348.20 → 4349.70] but partnership in the gospel,
[4350.16 → 4350.50] Livonia,
[4350.70 → 4352.64] is possible in and through Jesus.
[4353.42 → 4354.66] At every step of the way.
[4355.14 → 4355.30] Right?
[4355.42 → 4357.06] Jesus was the ultimate teammate
[4357.06 → 4360.50] who not only saves you and rescues you,
[4360.60 → 4362.64] but invites you into partnership with him.
[4363.88 → 4364.96] Jesus said to his disciples,
[4365.12 → 4366.98] I no longer call you servants.
[4367.14 → 4368.06] I call you friends.
[4368.18 → 4369.70] I call you teammates.
[4369.96 → 4371.24] We're going to do this work together.
[4372.54 → 4375.22] Jesus is the one who never gives up on you.
[4376.20 → 4376.34] Right?
[4376.44 → 4378.02] Peter, I'm going to forgive you again.
[4378.74 → 4379.84] Oh, you messed up again.
[4380.28 → 4381.52] Peter, I'm going to forgive you again.
[4382.66 → 4385.02] And he says that to you as well.
[4385.62 → 4386.94] And we say it to each other.
[4388.66 → 4391.04] Jesus is the one who bore the ultimate burden
[4391.04 → 4392.96] of your sin and your shame on the cross.
[4393.36 → 4395.80] Jesus is the one who loves you unconditionally.
[4395.80 → 4399.54] And so the invitation for us,
[4399.74 → 4400.54] Latin or CRC,
[4401.30 → 4403.18] as we look ahead to the years
[4403.18 → 4404.26] and the decades to come,
[4404.26 → 4406.58] is the invitation of Livonia,
[4407.12 → 4408.22] partnership in the gospel.
[4409.12 → 4411.14] And it's in and through Jesus Christ
[4411.14 → 4412.98] because Jesus loves his church.
[4413.68 → 4415.66] And by the wonder of his grace,
[4415.76 → 4418.46] he invites us to partner with him
[4418.46 → 4420.64] and to partner with one another
[4420.64 → 4426.00] as we live out this holy gospel Livonia together.
[4426.00 → 4428.28] So let's pray that God would help us.
[4431.56 → 4435.82] Heavenly Father, we ask for the grace that we need
[4435.82 → 4442.28] to move deeper into gospel partnership with you
[4442.28 → 4446.48] and deeper partnership with one another
[4446.48 → 4447.86] as your church.
[4447.86 → 4449.74] Lord, would you shape each of us individually
[4449.74 → 4451.36] and together by your grace
[4451.36 → 4452.92] that we may follow you,
[4453.26 → 4455.98] that we may become more and more like you
[4455.98 → 4458.58] as you work within us, and you work among us
[4458.58 → 4460.54] for your glory in the world.
[4460.86 → 4462.16] We ask this in Jesus' name.
[4462.92 → 4463.84] To the praise of God.
[4464.36 → 4464.70] Amen.
[4464.70 → 4468.94] Let's stand and we'll sing together.
[4470.16 → 4470.84] Amen.
[4471.38 → 4471.98] Amen.
[4493.20 → 4493.52] Amen.
[4493.52 → 4503.58] We rejoice in the Lord now and always
[4503.58 → 4506.88] Sing it again, we rejoice
[4506.88 → 4510.90] Delight in the love he has shown us
[4510.90 → 4514.08] Gratefully lift your voice
[4514.08 → 4518.22] Give gentleness among us
[4518.22 → 4521.50] We'll join our hearts with praise
[4521.50 → 4525.52] We gather in his goodness
[4525.52 → 4528.88] A family of grace
[4528.88 → 4532.12] With each rebel's given
[4532.12 → 4535.96] Praise the Lord
[4535.96 → 4539.54] In these times we live in
[4539.54 → 4543.04] We will praise the Lord
[4543.04 → 4546.26] Throughout every season
[4546.26 → 4553.44] I am sure we have every reason
[4553.44 → 4557.48] To praise the Lord
[4557.48 → 4562.64] We sing the Lord
[4562.64 → 4568.34] Pray for all that you need
[4568.34 → 4572.00] Come with the song of thanksgiving
[4572.00 → 4575.50] Lay your request at his feet
[4575.50 → 4578.86] His peace will fall upon us
[4578.86 → 4582.86] To guide our hearts and minds
[4582.86 → 4586.60] In Christ who reigns eternal
[4586.60 → 4590.24] Shepherd of our lives
[4590.24 → 4593.80] With each breath he's given
[4593.80 → 4597.60] Praise the Lord
[4597.60 → 4601.08] In these times we live in
[4601.08 → 4603.86] We will praise the Lord
[4603.86 → 4607.86] Throughout every season
[4607.86 → 4615.24] I am sure we have every reason
[4615.24 → 4619.30] To praise the Lord
[4619.30 → 4627.24] Rejoice in the Lord now and always
[4627.24 → 4630.24] Tell of the good he has done
[4630.24 → 4634.24] Worship the Lord to remember
[4634.24 → 4637.96] All the joy yet to come
[4637.96 → 4642.12] The hope that burns within us
[4642.12 → 4644.86] The dark cannot destroy
[4644.86 → 4649.42] With praise that's never ending
[4649.42 → 4652.86] We sing again, rejoice
[4652.86 → 4653.86] When the grace of the Lord
[4653.86 → 4654.86] When the grace of the Lord
[4654.86 → 4655.86] When the grace of the Lord
[4655.86 → 4656.86] When the grace of the Lord
[4656.86 → 4657.86] Praise the Lord
[4657.86 → 4659.86] Praise the Lord
[4659.86 → 4663.86] In these times we live in
[4663.86 → 4666.86] We will praise the Lord
[4666.86 → 4670.86] Throughout every season
[4670.86 → 4677.86] I am sure we have every reason
[4677.86 → 4681.86] To praise the Lord
[4681.86 → 4685.86] We have every reason
[4685.86 → 4690.86] To praise the Lord
[4690.86 → 4703.86] So we will continue to rejoice
[4703.86 → 4704.86] And to praise the Lord
[4704.86 → 4705.86] And to praise the Lord
[4705.86 → 4707.86] Together as we give our offering
[4707.86 → 4710.86] To him for his name's praise
[4710.86 → 4711.86] In the world
[4711.86 → 4713.86] And our designated offering
[4713.86 → 4714.86] For this morning is
[4714.86 → 4716.86] Therefore Go Ministries
[4716.86 → 4718.86] And you can read about it there
[4718.86 → 4719.86] May I invite our deacons
[4719.86 → 4722.86] To collect the morning offering
[4722.86 → 4723.86] A healthy morning offering
[4723.86 → 4724.86] Thank you
[4724.86 → 4725.86] Thank you
[4725.86 → 4726.86] Thank you
[4726.86 → 4728.86] Thank you
[4756.86 → 4758.86] Thank you
[4786.86 → 4788.86] Thank you
[4816.86 → 4818.86] Thank you
[4846.86 → 4848.86] Thank you
[4876.86 → 4878.86] Thank you
[4906.86 → 4907.86] Thank you
[4907.86 → 4908.86] Thank you
[4908.86 → 4909.86] Thank you
[4909.86 → 4910.86] Thank you
[4910.86 → 4911.86] Thank you
[4911.86 → 4912.86] Thank you
[4912.86 → 4913.86] Thank you
[4913.86 → 4914.86] Thank you
[4914.86 → 4916.86] You know when I was a child
[4916.86 → 4927.86] This is how church services would start
[4927.86 → 4930.86] There were no announcements
[4930.86 → 4933.86] Not before, not during, not after
[4933.86 → 4936.86] It was a worship service
[4936.86 → 4940.86] An elder would come and bring the minister up front
[4940.86 → 4943.86] The organ would stop
[4943.86 → 4946.86] The congregation would rise
[4946.86 → 4948.86] And the minister would say
[4948.86 → 4952.86] The Lord is in his holy temple
[4952.86 → 4957.86] Let all the earth be silent before him
[4957.86 → 4960.86] And then there was silence
[4960.86 → 4963.86] And there was reverence
[4963.86 → 4967.86] And there was reverence
[4967.86 → 4969.86] As we prepare our hearts for prayer
[4969.86 → 4973.86] Fill your heart with reverence
[4973.86 → 4978.86] Reverence is a big part of prayer
[4978.86 → 4982.86] This prayer has four parts
[4982.86 → 4988.86] Adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication
[4988.86 → 4990.86] Please join me
[4990.86 → 4997.86] Lord, you have been our dwelling place
[4997.86 → 5000.86] Throughout all generations
[5000.86 → 5004.86] The earth is the Lord's
[5004.86 → 5006.86] And the fullness thereof
[5006.86 → 5012.86] Holy, holy, holy
[5012.86 → 5015.86] Is the Lord Almighty
[5015.86 → 5019.86] The whole earth is full of his glory
[5019.86 → 5025.86] Eternal, infinite spirit
[5025.86 → 5029.86] Source of life and love
[5029.86 → 5035.86] Of all that is good and true and beautiful
[5035.86 → 5037.86] We worship you
[5037.86 → 5038.86] We worship you
[5038.86 → 5040.86] We praise you
[5040.86 → 5044.86] We sing to the Lord in new song
[5044.86 → 5046.86] You have done marvellous things
[5046.86 → 5050.86] All the ends of the earth have seen
[5050.86 → 5053.86] The salvation of our God
[5053.86 → 5056.86] Trees of the field, clap your hands
[5056.86 → 5062.86] Father, you have not only made us
[5062.86 → 5067.86] In Christ, you are remaking us
[5067.86 → 5072.86] You do that within the context of a congregation
[5072.86 → 5075.86] The family of God
[5075.86 → 5078.86] The redeemed of the Lord
[5078.86 → 5081.86] The bride and body of Jesus
[5081.86 → 5086.86] We are not just fragmented individuals
[5086.86 → 5091.86] Jim here, Joe there, Rita Rosalyn
[5091.86 → 5095.86] No, we are people of God
[5095.86 → 5098.86] This is what we confess
[5098.86 → 5100.86] That the Son of God
[5100.86 → 5103.86] Out of the whole human race
[5103.86 → 5106.86] From the beginning to the end of the world
[5106.86 → 5111.86] Gathers, defends, and preserves for himself
[5111.86 → 5115.86] By his spirit and word in the unity of faith
[5115.86 → 5120.86] A church chosen to everlasting life
[5120.86 → 5124.86] And that I am and forever
[5124.86 → 5129.86] Shall remain a living member thereof
[5129.86 → 5132.86] For 75 years
[5132.86 → 5134.86] This Later congregation
[5134.86 → 5137.86] Is part of that church
[5137.86 → 5139.86] The body of Christ
[5139.86 → 5141.86] The redeemed of the Lord
[5141.86 → 5145.86] Jesus, that is your doing
[5145.86 → 5149.86] You gave faithfulness to our fathers and mothers
[5149.86 → 5151.86] And many others who joined them
[5151.86 → 5154.86] This is not the church of Later
[5154.86 → 5157.86] This is the church of Jesus
[5157.86 → 5159.86] We praise you
[5159.86 → 5161.86] Thank you
[5161.86 → 5162.86] Thank you
[5162.86 → 5163.86] For building in this place
[5163.86 → 5164.86] In our life
[5164.86 → 5165.86] From these people
[5165.86 → 5166.86] A community
[5166.86 → 5167.86] A body
[5167.86 → 5169.86] A part of the church
[5169.86 → 5170.86] Of all times
[5170.86 → 5171.86] Of all places
[5171.86 → 5174.86] And in recent years
[5174.86 → 5176.86] We have been joined by many
[5176.86 → 5178.86] From around the globe
[5178.86 → 5180.86] And diverse backgrounds
[5180.86 → 5182.86] Together we foreshadow
[5182.86 → 5184.86] That vast multitude
[5184.86 → 5186.86] Before the throne of God
[5186.86 → 5188.86] Drawn from every nation
[5188.86 → 5190.86] People and tongue
[5190.86 → 5192.86] Praising you
[5192.86 → 5193.86] Without end
[5193.86 → 5196.86] This congregation
[5196.86 → 5197.86] Is an embodiment
[5197.86 → 5199.86] Of your kingdom
[5199.86 → 5200.86] On this street
[5200.86 → 5201.86] In this town
[5201.86 → 5203.86] At this point in time
[5203.86 → 5204.86] By sinners
[5204.86 → 5208.86] That is astounding
[5208.86 → 5211.86] God among us
[5211.86 → 5215.86] The covenant God
[5215.86 → 5218.86] The one who is faithful
[5218.86 → 5220.86] Even when we are not
[5220.86 → 5223.86] Thank you
[5223.86 → 5226.86] Father, Son, Holy Spirit
[5226.86 → 5231.86] Even as we celebrate 75 years
[5231.86 → 5232.86] Of your faithfulness
[5232.86 → 5235.86] It is proper and right
[5235.86 → 5237.86] That we open our hearts
[5237.86 → 5238.86] In confession
[5238.86 → 5243.86] We have been unfaithful servants
[5243.86 → 5246.86] Lord have mercy
[5246.86 → 5249.86] Seventy-five years ago
[5249.86 → 5250.86] We aspired
[5250.86 → 5253.86] To rejoice in the Lord always
[5253.86 → 5255.86] To let our gentleness
[5255.86 → 5258.86] Be evident to all
[5258.86 → 5260.86] To not be anxious
[5260.86 → 5262.86] About anything
[5262.86 → 5266.86] Too often we have missed the mark
[5266.86 → 5268.86] Part of us rebels
[5268.86 → 5270.86] Against the Jesus way
[5270.86 → 5272.86] The way of self-denial
[5272.86 → 5275.86] The call to be the least
[5275.86 → 5278.86] To consider others better than ourselves
[5278.86 → 5281.86] To return evil with good
[5281.86 → 5284.86] To turn the other cheek
[5284.86 → 5286.86] To walk the extra mile
[5286.86 → 5288.86] To be our brother's keeper
[5288.86 → 5292.86] To respect God's image in all others
[5292.86 → 5295.86] To love the unloveable
[5295.86 → 5297.86] Seventy-five years
[5297.86 → 5299.86] And we still fail
[5299.86 → 5303.86] At the most basic level of discipleship
[5303.86 → 5306.86] We confess it
[5306.86 → 5310.86] Lord have mercy
[5310.86 → 5313.86] Father God
[5313.86 → 5316.86] In every aspect of life
[5316.86 → 5318.86] Sin clings to us
[5318.86 → 5320.86] As with cayenne
[5320.86 → 5322.86] It crouches at our door
[5322.86 → 5324.86] Too much ego
[5324.86 → 5326.86] Too little humility
[5326.86 → 5328.86] Pride in our tradition
[5328.86 → 5330.86] Our theology
[5330.86 → 5332.86] Our denomination
[5332.86 → 5333.86] Our doctrines
[5333.86 → 5334.86] Confession
[5334.86 → 5335.86] And creeds
[5335.86 → 5336.86] Acts of charity
[5336.86 → 5337.86] Our many ministries
[5337.86 → 5339.86] Our exemplary
[5339.86 → 5341.86] Dutiful Christian lifestyle
[5341.86 → 5347.86] But you are not interested in performances
[5347.86 → 5350.86] You want a pure heart
[5350.86 → 5354.86] Have no other gods before me
[5354.86 → 5356.86] We know that
[5356.86 → 5360.86] But our idols are so attractive
[5360.86 → 5361.86] They flatter us
[5361.86 → 5364.86] They stroke our ego
[5364.86 → 5367.86] We enjoy building our own little kingdoms
[5367.86 → 5369.86] Seventy-five years of it
[5369.86 → 5371.86] Lord have mercy
[5371.86 → 5375.86] And then the idols of our culture
[5375.86 → 5380.86] Reducing all life to economics and consumerism
[5380.86 → 5383.86] Worshipping progress, science, technology
[5383.86 → 5385.86] We are all implicated
[5385.86 → 5386.86] We are all implicated
[5386.86 → 5388.86] Drenched in it
[5388.86 → 5390.86] Lord have mercy
[5390.86 → 5394.86] There is much to confess
[5394.86 → 5398.86] But there is even more to celebrate
[5398.86 → 5399.86] To be thankful for
[5399.86 → 5402.86] Seventy-five years of grace
[5402.86 → 5404.86] Forgiveness, redemption
[5404.86 → 5408.86] As far as the east is from the west
[5408.86 → 5412.86] So far you remove our transgressions from us
[5412.86 → 5414.86] You remember our sins no more
[5414.86 → 5420.86] Every week your people gathered around the old, old story
[5420.86 → 5423.86] Of Jesus and his glory
[5423.86 → 5426.86] Of Jesus and his love
[5426.86 → 5429.86] The sacraments were administered
[5429.86 → 5432.86] Public professions of faith were made
[5432.86 → 5434.86] The gospel was preached
[5434.86 → 5438.86] The simple stories Jesus taught were retold
[5438.86 → 5442.86] A father has two sons
[5442.86 → 5444.86] The younger is bad
[5444.86 → 5446.86] Very bad
[5446.86 → 5447.86] He is the lost son
[5447.86 → 5450.86] It is this lost son
[5450.86 → 5452.86] This bad one
[5452.86 → 5456.86] He ends up as guest of honour at a feast
[5456.86 → 5459.86] No expenses spared
[5459.86 → 5462.86] Nothing is too good for this boy
[5462.86 → 5466.86] Weekly in this Latin church
[5466.86 → 5469.86] Human wisdom is punctured
[5469.86 → 5474.86] Human priorities turned upside down
[5474.86 → 5477.86] Here Jesus is king
[5477.86 → 5480.86] That is our story
[5480.86 → 5484.86] It is the story of your love, Father
[5484.86 → 5490.86] Eternal, extravagant, infinite love
[5490.86 → 5491.86] Thank you
[5491.86 → 5496.86] As of old, in the building of the tabernacle
[5496.86 → 5498.86] You prepared people
[5498.86 → 5500.86] Giving them a serving heart
[5500.86 → 5502.86] And skills for ministry
[5502.86 → 5503.86] Sunday school teachers
[5503.86 → 5504.86] Nursery care
[5504.86 → 5505.86] Kitchen duties
[5505.86 → 5506.86] Deacons
[5506.86 → 5507.86] Elders
[5507.86 → 5508.86] Pastors
[5508.86 → 5509.86] Refugee workers
[5509.86 → 5510.86] Janitors
[5510.86 → 5511.86] Musicians
[5511.86 → 5513.86] Youth leaders
[5513.86 → 5516.86] People skilled in administration
[5516.86 → 5517.86] Finance
[5517.86 → 5518.86] Building maintenance
[5518.86 → 5520.86] And those gifted to visit
[5520.86 → 5522.86] And comfort the sick
[5522.86 → 5523.86] The bereaved
[5523.86 → 5527.86] You gave those brothers and sisters to us
[5527.86 → 5530.86] They enriched our life
[5530.86 → 5534.86] They were the hands and feet of Jesus in this community
[5534.86 → 5540.86] How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
[5540.86 → 5543.86] Thank you, Lord
[5543.86 → 5544.86] Thank you, Lord
[5544.86 → 5546.86] For using this congregation
[5546.86 → 5550.86] To address our culture prophetically
[5550.86 → 5552.86] Through Christian day schools
[5552.86 → 5554.86] To welcome refugees
[5554.86 → 5558.86] To assist the ministry to the Chinese
[5558.86 → 5561.86] To show love through the Friendship Coffee House
[5561.86 → 5564.86] And many other ministries
[5564.86 → 5567.86] Thank you for a beautiful building
[5567.86 → 5569.86] And the generosity
[5569.86 → 5571.86] That makes it possible
[5571.86 → 5576.86] Lord, we also bring our needs before you
[5576.86 → 5581.86] Be with those members of our congregation who suffer
[5581.86 → 5585.86] Those who must deal with loss
[5585.86 → 5586.86] Those who grieve
[5586.86 → 5589.86] We think of Mel
[5589.86 → 5591.86] And Shirley Mass
[5591.86 → 5597.86] Be present to them as they struggle with multiple health issues
[5597.86 → 5601.86] You are the God of all comfort
[5601.86 → 5609.86] Lord, at this milestone we look back with grateful hearts
[5609.86 → 5613.86] But we also look ahead and don't like what we see
[5613.86 → 5619.86] Pews that should be occupied by our children and grandchildren are empty
[5619.86 → 5625.86] Their voices do not fill this sanctuary with hymns of praise
[5625.86 → 5631.86] Zeal for you, the maker of heaven and earth, has grown stale
[5631.86 → 5637.86] We live in the most materialist culture of all time
[5637.86 → 5641.86] A culture that reduces everything to matter
[5641.86 → 5643.86] To a machine
[5643.86 → 5645.86] Humans included
[5645.86 → 5649.86] All sacredness, mystery, and awe
[5649.86 → 5651.86] Has been abandoned
[5651.86 → 5654.86] It grieves us
[5654.86 → 5657.86] As it grieves you
[5657.86 → 5660.86] Lacking a life of the spirit
[5660.86 → 5662.86] People are consumed by consumption
[5662.86 → 5665.86] Stop the shop till you drop
[5665.86 → 5671.86] Father, help us speak your word of life
[5671.86 → 5675.86] To the deadening spirit of our times
[5675.86 → 5681.86] Prevent us from escaping into a spiritual realm
[5681.86 → 5685.86] Help us witness that the purpose of life is not heaven
[5685.86 → 5691.86] But that the purpose of life is to bring the life of heaven to earth
[5691.86 → 5696.86] That the great spiritual contest is about earth
[5696.86 → 5700.86] Who will rule this earth?
[5700.86 → 5705.86] Your promise is to make the creation right again
[5705.86 → 5709.86] Lord, use us to that end
[5709.86 → 5712.86] Our moment in history is humbling
[5712.86 → 5715.86] Let it bring us to our knees
[5715.86 → 5723.86] Will this congregation last another 25 years and get to be 100?
[5723.86 → 5727.86] The future looks bleak, grim
[5727.86 → 5732.86] But this is not our church
[5732.86 → 5735.86] It is your church, Jesus
[5735.86 → 5739.86] You do not ask us to be successful
[5739.86 → 5741.86] But faithful
[5741.86 → 5744.86] And then we must leave it to you
[5744.86 → 5748.86] All the while remembering your promise
[5748.86 → 5751.86] Lo, I am with you always
[5751.86 → 5755.86] Even until the end of the world
[5755.86 → 5758.86] Let that promise be our hope
[5758.86 → 5763.86] Jesus, with your church abide
[5763.86 → 5767.86] Be our Saviour, Lord and guide
[5767.86 → 5771.86] While on earth our faith is tried
[5771.86 → 5775.86] Lord our Saviour, hear us
[5775.86 → 5779.86] May our lamp of truth be bright
[5779.86 → 5782.86] May we raise on high its light
[5782.86 → 5786.86] Through the realms of darkest night
[5786.86 → 5790.86] Lord our Saviour, hear us
[5791.86 → 5795.86] Glory be to the Father and to the Son
[5795.86 → 5797.86] And to the Holy Spirit
[5797.86 → 5800.86] As it was in the beginning is now
[5800.86 → 5802.86] And ever will be
[5802.86 → 5803.86] Amen
[5803.86 → 5804.86] Amen
[5833.86 → 5835.86] Amen
[5835.86 → 5836.86] Amen
[5836.86 → 5838.86] Amen
[5838.86 → 5839.86] Amen
[5839.86 → 5841.86] Amen
[5841.86 → 5844.86] Amen
[5844.86 → 5845.86] Amen
[5845.86 → 5847.86] Amen
[5848.86 → 5849.86] Amen
[5849.86 → 5850.86] Amen
[5850.86 → 5852.86] Amen
[5852.86 → 5853.86] Amen
[5853.86 → 5857.86] Praise God from the moon of blessings come
[5857.86 → 5867.86] Praise Him, all creatures near beyond
[5867.86 → 5876.86] Praise Him, all the heavenly walls
[5877.58 → 5885.86] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
[5887.86 → 5892.86] Praise the Father, praise the Son
[5892.86 → 5896.86] Praise the Spirit, God be praised
[5896.86 → 5901.86] Every moment, all our days
[5901.86 → 5906.86] God be praised, O God be praised
[5906.86 → 5919.86] Praise God, good morning's breaking night
[5919.86 → 5925.86] Praise Him, through darkness of the night
[5925.86 → 5938.86] Praise Him, with every breath of night
[5938.86 → 5948.86] Praise Him, my soul, with all your mind
[5948.86 → 5953.86] Praise Him, Father, praise the Son
[5953.86 → 5957.86] Praise the Spirit, God be praised
[5957.86 → 5962.86] Every moment, all our days
[5962.86 → 5967.86] God be praised, O God be praised
[5967.86 → 5973.86] Praise the Father, praise the Son
[5973.86 → 5977.86] Praise the Spirit, who love us
[5977.86 → 5982.86] Every moment, all our days
[5982.86 → 5987.86] God be praised, O God be praised
[5987.86 → 5992.86] Praise God, when face to face we sing
[5992.86 → 6002.86] Praise God, when face to face we sing
[6002.86 → 6011.86] The one who died to set us free
[6011.86 → 6021.86] The one who rose in victory
[6021.86 → 6026.86] Praise now, forever Christ, O Lord be praised
[6026.86 → 6032.86] Praise now, forever Christ, O Lord be praised
[6032.86 → 6057.86] Praise God be praised
[6057.86 → 6069.98] Here in the house with us, every moment, all our days, God be praised, oh God be praised.
[6069.98 → 6079.88] God be praised, oh God be praised, God be praised, oh God be praised.
[6087.86 → 6093.92] Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[6097.92 → 6103.92] Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[6107.82 → 6113.48] Praise Him, above ye and below.
[6117.86 → 6127.04] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[6127.04 → 6132.04] Amen.
[6132.04 → 6137.76] Thank you, Mr. May, standing.
[6146.28 → 6149.06] So, please receive the benediction.
[6149.06 → 6158.24] Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all that we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,
[6158.80 → 6164.98] to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever.
[6165.64 → 6166.04] Amen.
[6167.80 → 6170.66] Thank you for worshipping the Lord with us today.
[6170.66 → 6176.22] We have cake, we have coffee, we have lots of other snacks.
[6176.92 → 6180.48] In fact, we have so much extra food, please take some home with you.
[6181.26 → 6185.58] So stay, enjoy it, bring it home, and we'll fellowship together.
[6187.26 → 6188.12] God be with you.
[6188.12 → 6218.10] God be with you.
[6218.12 → 6248.10] God be with you.
[6248.12 → 6278.10] God be with you.
