[396.98 --> 397.98]  Well, good morning.
[397.98 --> 412.58]  And welcome, everyone, on this, well, relatively cool summer morning to our service today.
[412.58 --> 419.80]  And a special welcome this morning goes out to Pastor Victor Chua, who's a pastor at Emmanuel CRC in Richmond.
[420.04 --> 424.66]  And he will be leading us in exploring God's word as found in John a little later in the service.
[425.44 --> 433.52]  As for myself, my name is Jake Cron, and I'll be leading us through the first portion of this service, at least, and the communal prayer after the message.
[434.40 --> 435.68]  And it's good to be here.
[435.68 --> 444.10]  It's good to take some time this morning to acknowledge Jesus as our Lord and Savior and spend time in praise, worship, and fellowship.
[444.58 --> 450.64]  And I do hope and trust that today's service will be meaningful and enriching for all of us here this morning.
[452.50 --> 463.46]  It is summertime, so I don't have a lot of announcements, but one, a very happy one, Donna Marion celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on Friday.
[463.46 --> 465.26]  So congratulations to you too.
[465.68 --> 466.74]  That's huge.
[469.96 --> 474.08]  And I think they're providing us some cake after the service too, which is also great.
[474.24 --> 474.52]  Thank you.
[475.70 --> 475.82]  Yeah.
[477.26 --> 478.60]  Yeah, exactly, right?
[478.72 --> 478.88]  Yeah.
[481.88 --> 485.14]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 107.
[486.08 --> 488.86]  Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for God is good.
[489.44 --> 492.06]  For God's steadfast love endures forever.
[492.06 --> 494.80]  Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[494.80 --> 497.28]  For God has redeemed us from trouble.
[498.08 --> 503.68]  Let us thank the Lord for God's steadfast love, for God's wonderful works to humankind.
[504.86 --> 511.50]  Let us come before God with thanksgiving and tell of God's deeds with joy and songs of joy.
[511.50 --> 513.60]  Please join me in prayer.
[514.78 --> 515.66]  Thank you.
[515.66 --> 519.88]  Everlasting God.
[519.94 --> 520.94]  Everlasting God.
[520.94 --> 524.04]  We gather together knowing you are present among us.
[524.04 --> 533.00]  guide our hearts and minds to listen for your word in our hearts, in our movement, in our prayers.
[534.10 --> 548.26]  Open us to new insights, to be challenged by the scriptures, to be assured by our songs, to be encouraged in prayer, knowing that you are making all things new, including us.
[548.26 --> 552.08]  May we be open to the spirit in this time.
[552.70 --> 552.92]  Amen.
[554.92 --> 558.84]  Now is a good time to stand, if you are able, and greet those around you.
[559.48 --> 563.80]  Then remain standing, again, if you are able, as we spend some time in praise.
[563.80 --> 593.78]  Thank you.
[593.80 --> 613.82]  Thank you.
[613.82 --> 619.32]  For this next song, if the men could follow along with me, please.
[619.32 --> 648.72]  From the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens,
[648.72 --> 652.76]  your name be praised.
[652.76 --> 661.22]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong,
[661.22 --> 670.48]  from the lips of old people, this song we raise for.
[670.48 --> 682.48]  Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[682.48 --> 693.48]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[693.48 --> 700.48]  Be magnified, be magnified.
[700.48 --> 714.48]  From the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heavens,
[714.48 --> 718.52]  your name be praised.
[718.52 --> 730.52]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, your name be praised.

[740.52 --> 747.52]  you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.

[771.52 --> 774.52]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[774.52 --> 781.52]  The march of rock, theands of all creation, our land, and our land of all creation—
[781.52 --> 801.68]  A thousand generations falling down in worship
[801.68 --> 808.34]  To sing their songs of ages to the land
[808.34 --> 813.04]  And all who've gone before us
[813.04 --> 816.38]  And all who will believe
[816.38 --> 822.38]  Will sing the song of ages to the land

[849.50 --> 853.08]  And the angels cry
[853.08 --> 859.94]  Holy, O creation cries
[859.94 --> 866.78]  Holy, you are lifted high
[866.78 --> 872.88]  Holy, holy forever
[872.88 --> 880.86]  If you've been forgiven
[880.86 --> 884.96]  And if you've been redeemed
[884.96 --> 889.76]  Sing the song forever to the land
[889.76 --> 894.20]  And if you walk in freedom
[894.20 --> 898.64]  And if you hear his name
[898.64 --> 903.70]  Sing the song forever to the land
[903.70 --> 908.64]  And sing the song forever and amen
[908.64 --> 912.76]  And the angels cry

[926.08 --> 932.14]  Holy, holy forever

[938.14 --> 945.26]  Holy, holy to the King of Kings
[945.26 --> 951.20]  Holy, you'll always be
[951.20 --> 957.14]  Holy, holy forever
[957.14 --> 962.14]  Holy, holy to the King of Kings
[962.14 --> 965.14]  Your name is the highest
[965.14 --> 968.14]  Your name is the greatest
[968.14 --> 973.58]  Your name stands above them all
[973.58 --> 978.14]  All thrones and dominions
[978.14 --> 979.14]  All powers and positions

[998.14 --> 1019.34]  them all. All thrones and dominions, all powers and positions, your name stands above them all, and the angels cry, Holy, O
[1019.34 --> 1049.32]  creation cries, Holy, you are lifted high, Holy, Holy forever. Hear your people sing, Holy, to the King of Kings, Holy,
[1049.34 --> 1072.42]  you'll always be Holy, Holy forever. You'll always be Holy, Holy forever.
[1072.42 --> 1078.62]  You may be seated.
[1078.62 --> 1079.62]  Amen.
[1079.62 --> 1093.62]  Please join me in a prayer of confession.
[1093.62 --> 1115.62]  Lord God, again we praise you for all that you are, all that you have been, and all that you will be. You are the one constant amidst the world of rapidly accelerating change, and we pray that we can hold fast to you as an anchor of truth.
[1115.62 --> 1125.62]  We confess this morning, Lord, that amidst all the pulls from the world around us that we have sometimes failed to live as faithful followers of you.
[1125.62 --> 1132.62]  We have not always used our time wisely, nor have we always shown love and compassion to those around us.
[1132.62 --> 1143.62]  We have been selfish, impatient, or distracted. We have missed opportunities to serve you and to share your love with others.
[1143.62 --> 1155.62]  Forgive us, Lord, for our shortcomings. We pray that through your mercy and grace extended to us through your sacrifice on the cross, that we can be washed clean of our sins.
[1155.62 --> 1164.62]  We pray that your spirit will work in and amongst us to renew us in us a desire to live each day in a way that honors you.
[1164.62 --> 1170.62]  Help us to be more mindful of your presence and to live with gratitude and purpose.
[1170.62 --> 1176.62]  And may this summer season be a time of spiritual growth and renewal for us all.
[1176.62 --> 1183.62]  We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
[1183.62 --> 1192.62]  Even in our moments of doubt, our lack of faith, and the blindness, which means we fail to see God amongst us, God is still at work.
[1192.62 --> 1196.62]  God is still healing. God is still forgiving.
[1196.62 --> 1203.62]  Even when we fail to see God, God still sees us and still loves us.
[1203.62 --> 1211.62]  Sisters and brothers, through Christ, your sins are forgiven. Be at peace and give praise to God.
[1211.62 --> 1216.62]  Our songs of response to that are Living Hope and O Church Arise.
[1216.62 --> 1220.62]  And after that, the children aged three to grade three are dismissed to their classes.
[1220.62 --> 1222.62]  Janie's speakers...
[1222.62 --> 1227.46] 耳
[1250.62 --> 1258.32]  to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[1258.32 --> 1270.32]  And through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[1270.32 --> 1282.32]  The walk is finished, the end is written, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1285.52 --> 1297.40]  Could you imagine so great a mercy, your heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[1297.40 --> 1309.48]  Their God of ages, stepped down from glory to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[1310.04 --> 1321.42]  Their cross has spoken, I have forgiven, their King of kings calls me his own.
[1321.42 --> 1333.50]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1333.50 --> 1340.70]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1341.08 --> 1346.92]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1347.30 --> 1353.22]  You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name.
[1353.22 --> 1359.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1362.22 --> 1368.22]  Then came the morning, God sealed the promise.
[1368.22 --> 1374.22]  Your very body began to breathe.
[1374.22 --> 1375.22]  Your very body began to breathe.
[1375.22 --> 1380.22]  Out of the silence, their roaring lion,
[1380.22 --> 1385.22]  Declared and weak, fast no claim on me.
[1385.22 --> 1386.22]  Jesus, yours is the victory.
[1386.22 --> 1387.22]  Jesus, yours is the victory.
[1387.22 --> 1392.22]  Then came the morning, God sealed the promise.
[1392.22 --> 1398.22]  Your very body began to breathe.
[1398.22 --> 1410.22]  Out of the silence, their roaring lion, Declared and grave, has no claim on me.
[1410.22 --> 1415.22]  Jesus, yours is the victory.
[1415.22 --> 1416.22]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1416.22 --> 1422.22]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1422.22 --> 1428.22]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1428.22 --> 1435.22]  You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name.
[1435.22 --> 1440.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1440.22 --> 1442.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1442.22 --> 1447.22]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1447.22 --> 1448.22]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[1448.22 --> 1453.22]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1453.22 --> 1460.22]  You have broken every chain, there's salvation in your name.
[1460.22 --> 1465.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1465.22 --> 1471.22]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1471.22 --> 1479.22]  Oh God, you are my living hope.
[1483.22 --> 1485.22]  Oh church, arise.
[1485.22 --> 1488.22]  We have to ask you to stand for the next song.
[1488.22 --> 1490.22]  Let's start.
[1490.22 --> 1491.22]  Amen.
[1520.22 --> 1521.22]  Amen.

[1826.20 --> 1830.12]  when they had finished eating jesus said to simon peter
[1830.12 --> 1834.04]  simon son of john do you love me more than these
[1834.04 --> 1837.96]  yes lord he said you know that i love you
[1837.96 --> 1839.96]  jesus said feed

[1845.64 --> 1851.08]  he answered yes lord you know that i love you jesus said take care of my sheep
[1852.12 --> 1855.56]  the third time he said to him simon son of john do you love me
[1855.56 --> 1861.48]  peter was hurt because jesus asked him the third time
[1861.48 --> 1862.36]  do you love me
[1862.36 --> 1864.52]  he said lord you know all things
[1865.08 --> 1867.24]  you know that i love you
[1867.24 --> 1869.40]  jesus said feed
[1869.40 --> 1869.56]  my
[1869.56 --> 1871.96]  sheep this is the word of the lord
[1871.96 --> 1876.52]  good morning my name is victor

[1890.52 --> 1898.84]  and you know i'm very privileged today to be able to speak god's word to you here this morning jason invited me he said he was going on vacation and he said
[1898.84 --> 1903.56]  it would be nice if if you could help so i'm really happy to help the church and
[1903.56 --> 1909.24]  council at emmanuel crc send their greetings and their love to you here at latina
[1910.76 --> 1918.68]  my wife isabel and i we moved to canada in 2018 so that i could study at regent to follow god's calling to be a pastor
[1920.52 --> 1925.00]  so i'll tell you a little bit about us so you get you get to you know know us a little bit
[1925.00 --> 1930.28]  early in the day before i met isabel
[1930.92 --> 1938.92]  i love diving right i i like diving it's this place where you go underwater 10 20 30 even 40 meters
[1938.92 --> 1945.96]  underwater it's quiet it's quiet so much so that as as you're going by you can hear maybe some of the
[1945.96 --> 1952.12]  parrot fish feeding on the coral you can hear your own heartbeat and your own breathing as you breathe in
[1952.12 --> 1958.60]  and out it's a wonderful space you know where there is silence and solitude and you're surrounded by
[1958.60 --> 1967.64]  the magnificent glorious wonder of creation that is underwater after meeting isabel though i stopped
[1967.64 --> 1972.04]  diving she doesn't quite like to be separated from the air
[1972.04 --> 1981.80]  and so we found various other things to do together you know we like to do road trips we like to to
[1981.80 --> 1989.32]  hike in the open we did these other things and i grew to love uh hiking i grew to love actually i one
[1989.32 --> 1995.08]  of the reasons why we moved here from singapore was because of the the great outdoors it's wonderful here
[1995.08 --> 2003.64]  in british columbia um and and so so with because of my love for isabel because i wanted to be with
[2003.64 --> 2010.92]  her i wanted to do spend time with her the other loves like the love of diving took second place the
[2010.92 --> 2019.16]  other loves kind of arranged themselves around one love one affection this morning we're going to look
[2019.16 --> 2027.08]  at john chapter 21 it's all about the affections of the heart the sermon title is more than these but
[2027.08 --> 2037.72]  before we begin let us pray father in heaven we thank you we thank you for each person here we thank you
[2037.72 --> 2047.24]  for the love that is shown forth for us in christ jesus we ask oh god that this love will find
[2048.20 --> 2054.44]  resting place in our hearts that our affections might be turned towards you may the words of my
[2054.44 --> 2060.68]  mouth and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable unto you this day we pray in jesus name amen
[2068.52 --> 2077.08]  we enter this passage and the moment that we get in we we are at the sea of tiberias this is
[2077.08 --> 2086.44]  jesus at the sea of galilee with his disciples this is after the death and the resurrection of jesus christ
[2086.44 --> 2092.84]  now the sea of galilee is actually a lake it's a freshwater lake in north israel and jesus spent much
[2092.84 --> 2099.80]  of his time ministering there many of his disciples hailed from this area you know and peter himself this
[2099.80 --> 2105.00]  is his hometown this is his hometown this is home ground for him peter makes an interesting statement
[2105.00 --> 2114.44]  he says i am going out to fish ever the leader even in this he goes fishing and six other disciples
[2114.44 --> 2122.44]  follow him thomas nathaniel james and john and two others unnamed just before this in the previous chapter
[2122.44 --> 2127.08]  peter and the disciples have already met the risen christ jesus appears to the disciples when they
[2127.08 --> 2131.64]  had barricaded themselves behind locked doors proclaiming to them the peace of god declaring
[2131.64 --> 2137.80]  to them that just as the father sent the son so also he was sending the disciples out he met thomas
[2137.80 --> 2142.84]  in the midst of his doubting thomas who said unless i see the nail marks in his hand unless i put my
[2142.84 --> 2147.96]  finger where the nails were and put my hand in his side i will not believe and jesus invited him to
[2147.96 --> 2155.32]  verify the wounds in his body and even thomas doubting thomas worshiped the risen christ saying my lord
[2155.32 --> 2164.20]  am i god so it is just a little puzzling when peter declares that he's going fishing
[2165.96 --> 2174.04]  and six of the disciples including thomas decide to go follow him you see christ is risen he's not dead
[2174.04 --> 2181.40]  in a tomb he's risen and peter has seen him shouldn't peter be that one that's preparing for an evangelistic
[2181.40 --> 2187.72]  rally of sorts at the transfiguration he already suggested building tabernacles for jesus moses and
[2187.72 --> 2194.04]  elijah now that jesus had risen from the dead should he not be thinking about setting up a big tent maybe
[2194.04 --> 2199.64]  for a revival meeting no better yet call it a resurrection meeting not just a revival meeting
[2200.28 --> 2210.04]  jesus had called them to be fishers of men shouldn't peter be prepared to address large crowds to tell them
[2210.04 --> 2219.48]  about the one who died and rose again jesus is alive but peter is going fishing
[2224.68 --> 2230.36]  you know early on when we meet peter in luke chapter 5 for example jesus says to him come
[2230.36 --> 2238.28]  follow me and i will send you to fish for people or in the version i remembered as as i was a kid
[2238.28 --> 2241.32]  follow me and i will make you a fisher of men
[2243.40 --> 2249.88]  luke chapter 5 is that classic passage where they fished all night these uh fishermen seasoned
[2249.88 --> 2254.52]  fishermen by the way this was their livelihood this was their jobs this was how they fed their families
[2254.52 --> 2261.72]  this was how they put food on the table they fished all night couldn't catch a single one and jesus asked
[2261.72 --> 2269.56]  them try one more time they caught so much fish that the two boats began to sink and and at that point
[2269.56 --> 2277.24]  at at that time at the at his first uh calling peter recognized that he was in the presence of someone
[2277.24 --> 2284.44]  divine he said go away from me lord for i am a sinful man i'm not good enough i'm not enough i'm a fish
[2284.44 --> 2291.24]  fisherman i'm unrefined i'm coarse at the edges i'm sinful inside i cannot be in the same space as you
[2291.24 --> 2299.88]  lord but the lord simply replied do not fear from now you will be fishers of men no longer was he a
[2299.88 --> 2305.88]  fisherman he had been called to be a fisher of men so in luke 5 when they had brought their boats to land
[2305.88 --> 2313.56]  peter and andrew left everything and followed him i'm not sure from then on whether they took those
[2313.56 --> 2321.24]  boats out to to to the lake anymore after that but in john chapter 21 a kind of reversal happens
[2322.28 --> 2327.72]  they weren't following jesus they went back to galilee they went back to everything that was
[2327.72 --> 2332.76]  familiar they brought their boats out boats that had been long left ashore now they brought out to the
[2332.76 --> 2339.48]  lake and although jesus had called them to be fishers of men peter and six others returned to be
[2339.48 --> 2347.88]  fishermen now peter peter he's enthusiastic right he's he's the first to respond to jesus he's that guy
[2347.88 --> 2353.48]  that will be the first to say something or to do something he's participated in the miraculous work of
[2353.48 --> 2362.36]  the kingdom of god he's walked on water well at least for a bit jesus is alive and peter goes fishing
[2362.36 --> 2373.40]  he's sliding back to his old job he's back sliding but jesus meets him right there just as peter is
[2373.40 --> 2381.40]  returning to his earthy fishy business these seven guys they go out once again but they can't catch a
[2381.40 --> 2388.36]  single fish some of them they spent all their lives out on the lake they know exactly where to go at what
[2388.36 --> 2395.88]  time at what debts to let their nets be cast down to they know all of that but again for some reason
[2396.36 --> 2406.04]  they cannot catch a single fish and he says to them friends friends haven't you any fish no they answered
[2407.72 --> 2413.96]  jesus appears to them in john 21 perhaps early in the morning perhaps when there isn't enough light
[2413.96 --> 2420.20]  for anyone to see and recognize him he's somewhat distant he's standing on the lake shore while they
[2420.20 --> 2427.08]  are out on the lake they don't recognize him but of course of course jesus knows who they are notice what
[2427.08 --> 2432.52]  jesus says to these seven guys who who have given up their god-given calling to go back to their old
[2432.52 --> 2440.76]  vocations he calls them friends well the greek word actually is paideon and it means child or infant all
[2440.76 --> 2446.04]  right but it can be used of grown men as a term of endearment it's kind of like when you use the
[2446.04 --> 2452.36]  word lads uh in in an english pub somewhere where grown men you know together watch soccer and and
[2452.36 --> 2458.92]  cheer like kids cheer you know for the same team they're kind of part of the same tribe lads they're not
[2458.92 --> 2466.44]  actually young boys but they're close friends they're part of the same tribe lads haven't you any fish
[2466.44 --> 2473.64]  and jesus meets peter and his friends in the midst of their backsliding and extends to them a greeting
[2473.64 --> 2476.68]  reserved for family or close friends
[2479.72 --> 2486.04]  and then he says throw your net out on the right side of the boat and you'll find some and when they
[2486.04 --> 2495.32]  did they were unable to haul the net because of the large number of fish a commanding voice booms out
[2495.32 --> 2503.48]  across the waters throw out your net on the right side and you will find some now if i was peter and
[2503.48 --> 2510.20]  if it was kind of dark getting light and if i was hearing a voice booming across the water i'd be like
[2511.16 --> 2518.92]  who's this guy who's this guy that's calling out to me from the water who is it that speaks with such
[2518.92 --> 2524.68]  authority does he not know that i'm an experienced fisherman does he not know that i know what i'm
[2524.68 --> 2534.20]  about who is this that commands me in the imperative throw your net and what follows is strangely reminiscent
[2534.20 --> 2541.56]  of that very first time that jesus calls peter experienced fishermen go out in their boats they can't
[2541.56 --> 2547.72]  catch a single thing jesus encourages them to try again they try again and then when they try again they
[2547.72 --> 2555.40]  struggle with the sheer weight of the fish that come in seven men strong guys whose days start with
[2555.40 --> 2561.88]  them dragging out their boats and nets into the lake and whose days end with them dragging those nets and
[2561.88 --> 2571.32]  and their boats back up ashore they were unable to haul the net in deja vu it's kind of like going back to
[2571.32 --> 2575.32]  a long forgotten place that you visited in your childhood you've forgotten as you grew up
[2575.32 --> 2585.72]  it's bringing peter right back to the first place of his call back before he betrayed jesus back before he
[2585.72 --> 2592.60]  denied knowing him it's bringing peter all the way back to his first encounter with jesus
[2592.60 --> 2605.96]  it is the lord john son of zebedee the disciple whom jesus loved was the first to declare it out loud it
[2605.96 --> 2613.96]  is the lord and immediately peter dives into the water peter who had led the six disciples to go fishing
[2613.96 --> 2620.20]  the minute he recognizes jesus even though he doesn't think that he's worthy enough to ask if he could walk on
[2620.20 --> 2624.76]  water this time he's just he's just going to dive in he desires to close the distance between him and
[2624.76 --> 2629.88]  jesus he's just going to be there close to his lord i you know you know what i consider myself not
[2629.88 --> 2636.76]  enough not good enough but it is the lord and i'm drawn by him i'm drawn to him so i'll dive in i will
[2636.76 --> 2642.68]  swim stroke by stroke i will swim i know how to do that at the very least
[2642.68 --> 2655.24]  when they all come ashore a fire had been prepared a very specific kind of fire a fire of burning coals
[2655.80 --> 2663.56]  a charcoal fire and in the greek is the word anthrakiya and jesus invites them by this fire come
[2663.56 --> 2675.24]  have breakfast by now no one asks him who he is they knew it was the lord and jesus invites them to a
[2675.24 --> 2683.24]  banquet a lakeside feast jesus provides food for them these hungry fishermen at the break of dawn
[2683.24 --> 2689.88]  and not only does he provide sustenance for their tired bodies he provides spiritual sustenance for their
[2689.88 --> 2700.28]  weary souls he prepared a banquet to welcome these ones who had decided to go back to their old jobs
[2701.80 --> 2705.48]  many of these disciples had forsaken jesus during his trial and crucifixion
[2706.20 --> 2712.20]  peter for example he denied ever knowing jesus many of the disciples were either not present or standing
[2712.20 --> 2718.68]  really far away at the crucifixion so i wonder if in their minds their actions on that day made themselves
[2719.32 --> 2725.72]  made them think of themselves as perhaps unworthy unworthy of jesus i i wonder if they thought
[2725.72 --> 2731.88]  whether that day their actions had created such a breach in the relationship that it was impossible
[2731.88 --> 2741.48]  for them to follow the resurrected jesus but the son of god knowing all of that he prepares breakfast for
[2741.48 --> 2749.64]  those who thought that there is no way back no means to repair the relationship breakfast instead of breach
[2753.32 --> 2756.28]  you see reconciliation between god and humanity
[2756.28 --> 2764.28]  humanity is a work of the trinitarian god himself it is a holy divine work it is initiated by god that
[2764.28 --> 2773.80]  humanity has no ability to conceive let alone achieve it is initiated by god and all of humanity is called
[2773.80 --> 2782.12]  to respond to respond in some way it is divine initiative that we're seeing here as jesus sets a table
[2782.92 --> 2790.84]  for the disciples so the son of god crucified but now raised to life himself sets that table
[2790.84 --> 2800.36]  and where the disciples perceived breach the son of god places breakfast come come and have breakfast
[2802.20 --> 2806.52]  perhaps in his mind peter has disqualified himself from the task of evangelization
[2807.24 --> 2812.68]  perhaps he might say to himself yes i have followed him for three years yes i was one of his first followers
[2812.68 --> 2818.68]  i was enthusiastic i was so enthusiastic i even promised jesus that even though everyone falls away
[2818.68 --> 2826.36]  i will never fall away and then and then i denied him i denied him three times three times i denied him
[2826.36 --> 2834.20]  and i even cursed and i saw and then i remembered that jesus had foretold this exact moment that i would betray
[2834.20 --> 2841.16]  him perhaps this kingdom business is not for salty fishermen like me jesus had foreseen he probably knows that
[2841.16 --> 2847.64]  i would fall away perhaps he has in mind someone else for the task someone more educated someone more refined more eloquent
[2847.88 --> 2855.48]  someone less flaky let me go back to what i know let me go back fishing i've seen the risen christ that's awesome in a way
[2855.80 --> 2861.88]  i'm happy and i'm relieved because the last time i checked my lord was dead and buried it is good to have him back again
[2861.88 --> 2866.12]  but maybe someone else is more qualified someone else
[2866.12 --> 2872.44]  i should declare and witness to the risen christ i am going fishing
[2875.64 --> 2884.92]  when they finish breakfast we come to that passage which we read just before this and three times we heard jesus
[2884.92 --> 2886.44]  ask peter do you love me
[2886.44 --> 2892.44]  how much that question would have wrenched the gut of Peter.
[2894.44 --> 2898.58]  Peter so aware of his betrayal, Peter so aware of the breach,
[2899.46 --> 2901.54]  Peter who is in the midst of backsliding,
[2902.70 --> 2904.82]  and he answers in the best way he knows,
[2905.62 --> 2907.26]  Yes, Lord, you know.
[2907.82 --> 2910.36]  In your divine wisdom, you know.
[2910.64 --> 2912.54]  You know I love you, you know everything.
[2913.22 --> 2914.64]  You know I love you.
[2914.64 --> 2916.90]  Three times Jesus then charges Peter,
[2917.18 --> 2918.42]  Feed my sheep.
[2918.64 --> 2919.80]  Take care of my sheep.
[2920.16 --> 2921.48]  Feed my sheep.
[2922.10 --> 2925.54]  In his first reading, when I first read this text,
[2925.74 --> 2926.54]  back when I was a teen,
[2927.12 --> 2930.52]  I had in my mind an angry and uncharitable Jesus.
[2931.92 --> 2935.92]  A Jesus that was here to make Peter pay for the betrayal,
[2936.20 --> 2938.00]  the breach, and the backsliding.
[2938.60 --> 2940.80]  But you know, the more that I read this text,
[2940.80 --> 2943.56]  the deeper that I go into John's Gospel,
[2943.56 --> 2947.24]  the more I'm certain that this is not so.
[2949.04 --> 2952.92]  By the way, the disciple John, you know, I always wondered
[2952.92 --> 2956.42]  why the disciple John doesn't identify himself,
[2956.82 --> 2958.64]  you know, with his name in the Gospel.
[2959.16 --> 2962.28]  It's always the disciple that Jesus loved, isn't it?
[2962.28 --> 2964.78]  And the more that I think about it,
[2965.16 --> 2967.06]  the more I think that John
[2967.06 --> 2972.34]  is so, has encountered Jesus' love so much.
[2972.42 --> 2976.18]  He's so tuned into the love of Jesus.
[2977.34 --> 2980.90]  It is such an important feature in his own life
[2980.90 --> 2982.98]  that at the end of his life,
[2983.22 --> 2985.98]  perhaps towards the end as he's writing this Gospel,
[2985.98 --> 2988.88]  his name is not so much important.
[2988.94 --> 2991.78]  It's not so much important for people to know him as John,
[2991.94 --> 2993.28]  or as John the disciple,
[2993.66 --> 2996.22]  or as John, son of Zebedee.
[2996.30 --> 2998.10]  It's not so much important for him
[2998.10 --> 2999.70]  as it is for people to know
[2999.70 --> 3003.24]  that he is that disciple that Jesus loved.
[3003.90 --> 3007.08]  He would rather his readers know of him
[3007.08 --> 3008.98]  as the disciple that Jesus loved
[3008.98 --> 3011.60]  rather than his own name.
[3011.60 --> 3016.68]  So this disciple who really knows the love of Jesus
[3016.68 --> 3019.90]  is giving us insight into the mind of Jesus.
[3020.02 --> 3021.52]  The deeper that I go into the text,
[3021.64 --> 3024.24]  the more I think that it is not an angry,
[3024.52 --> 3028.10]  uncharitable Jesus that's speaking this.
[3028.92 --> 3029.76]  Why do I think so?
[3031.52 --> 3034.14]  I think so because of a Greek word.
[3034.72 --> 3035.22]  Excuse me.
[3038.16 --> 3039.54]  The word is anthrakiia.
[3039.54 --> 3044.24]  You see, there is another element in this narrative
[3044.24 --> 3046.22]  that is strangely familiar.
[3047.02 --> 3049.60]  Another element of deja vu, so to speak.
[3050.36 --> 3052.52]  The word that is used here to describe
[3052.52 --> 3055.06]  that lakeside fire in verse 9
[3055.06 --> 3056.84]  is the word anthrakiia.
[3056.98 --> 3059.48]  It happens a grand total of two times
[3059.48 --> 3060.92]  in the whole New Testament.
[3061.56 --> 3062.00]  Once here,
[3062.66 --> 3065.76]  and once in John chapter 18, verse 18.
[3065.76 --> 3069.66]  It was around that other coal fire,
[3070.46 --> 3073.54]  that other coal fire,
[3073.66 --> 3075.22]  that Peter was in the courtyard
[3075.22 --> 3076.80]  of the high priest,
[3077.94 --> 3080.76]  warming himself up as Jesus was being tried.
[3082.64 --> 3084.46]  He and a few others were warming themselves
[3084.46 --> 3086.04]  before an anthrakiia.
[3086.78 --> 3087.76]  And it was there,
[3088.08 --> 3089.70]  it was at that very place,
[3090.20 --> 3092.68]  that he angrily denied knowing Christ.
[3092.68 --> 3096.24]  I don't know if any of you are in the mining business,
[3096.36 --> 3096.90]  but if you are,
[3096.98 --> 3098.80]  you might have heard of anthracite coal.
[3099.42 --> 3101.86]  It's much less common than the other kinds of coal.
[3101.96 --> 3104.88]  It only makes up about 1% of the world's coal.
[3105.14 --> 3107.18]  It has the highest grade of carbon content.
[3107.36 --> 3109.26]  It's got the highest heating value
[3109.26 --> 3111.74]  compared to all other kinds of coal.
[3111.80 --> 3114.00]  It's kind of like posh coal, right?
[3114.80 --> 3116.86]  It was rare, naturally,
[3117.10 --> 3118.76]  in natural occurrence, very rare.
[3118.76 --> 3122.44]  Eh, it was also rare in biblical occurrence.
[3125.14 --> 3127.42]  Mind you, writing equipment in those days
[3127.42 --> 3129.06]  was extremely expensive,
[3129.32 --> 3130.60]  both the ink and the paper.
[3131.32 --> 3132.56]  It would have been a lot easier
[3132.56 --> 3133.42]  and a lot shorter
[3133.42 --> 3135.16]  to write the common word for fire,
[3135.32 --> 3135.92]  which is pur.
[3136.54 --> 3139.34]  It would be five Greek letters less than anthrakiia.
[3139.34 --> 3141.44]  It was by the fire,
[3141.48 --> 3144.52]  but it was by the fire of the first anthrakiia
[3144.52 --> 3147.90]  that Peter denied Jesus three times.
[3148.26 --> 3149.20]  I do not know him.
[3149.40 --> 3150.40]  I am not a follower.
[3150.84 --> 3152.70]  I do not know what you are talking about.
[3153.30 --> 3158.24]  So it will be by the fire of the second anthrakiia
[3158.24 --> 3161.68]  that Jesus will ask him three times,
[3162.68 --> 3163.34]  do you love me?
[3163.34 --> 3170.38]  It will be by this second anthrakiia
[3170.38 --> 3174.46]  that Peter will declare his love for Jesus three times.
[3175.42 --> 3177.00]  Yes, Lord, you know I love you.
[3177.12 --> 3179.30]  Yes, Lord, you know I love you.
[3179.66 --> 3181.38]  Lord, you know everything.
[3182.08 --> 3184.18]  You know that I love you.
[3184.48 --> 3186.50]  By the way, this last declaration,
[3186.76 --> 3188.86]  although it does not have a yes in it,
[3189.02 --> 3192.16]  it is actually the strongest declaration of all three
[3192.16 --> 3195.06]  because it is a theological declaration.
[3195.64 --> 3198.56]  He says, Lord, you know everything.
[3199.88 --> 3202.40]  You know all that is going to happen.
[3202.52 --> 3204.68]  This is a declaration that Jesus is divine.
[3204.78 --> 3206.88]  He has divine knowledge of all things.
[3207.60 --> 3208.92]  He knows everything,
[3209.06 --> 3212.82]  including his own answer to this very question
[3212.82 --> 3214.22]  that Jesus is asking.
[3214.82 --> 3217.96]  He is saying, you are the Son of God.
[3218.04 --> 3220.82]  I am sure you know my answer.
[3222.16 --> 3223.98]  And so it happened in this way.
[3224.90 --> 3227.74]  For every time that Peter denied Jesus,
[3228.38 --> 3233.62]  Jesus allowed Peter to affirm his love for him once again.
[3234.18 --> 3236.68]  For every time that Peter disowned Jesus,
[3236.94 --> 3238.26]  he got a chance to say,
[3238.44 --> 3241.04]  Lord, you know that I love you.
[3242.48 --> 3245.80]  This is Jesus, not angry,
[3246.50 --> 3247.16]  not uncharitable.
[3247.16 --> 3247.72]  Uncharitable.
[3248.10 --> 3251.18]  This is Jesus gently restoring Peter,
[3251.60 --> 3255.18]  allowing Peter to declare his love and affection for Jesus.
[3256.20 --> 3258.76]  How wonderful that the Son of God,
[3258.90 --> 3260.42]  through whom all things were made,
[3260.88 --> 3263.06]  through whom we live and breathe and have our being,
[3263.18 --> 3266.40]  would think, would even think to restore Peter.
[3267.28 --> 3269.14]  It is not that Jesus was angry.
[3269.48 --> 3274.04]  It was not that he was trying to haul Peter over the coals,
[3274.04 --> 3275.94]  so to speak, over the anthrakiah.
[3276.02 --> 3278.42]  It was to give him a chance to say
[3278.42 --> 3281.18]  that which was on his own heart.
[3281.36 --> 3284.30]  For Peter to say that which was on his own heart.
[3284.38 --> 3286.90]  A chance for him to flip the script, so to speak.
[3287.84 --> 3288.80]  This is love.
[3289.84 --> 3291.12]  This is the love of Jesus.
[3291.86 --> 3294.22]  Love that precedes Peter's own love.
[3294.74 --> 3297.70]  Love that exceeds Peter's own love.
[3297.70 --> 3302.40]  Now what?
[3306.08 --> 3308.50]  What do we think when Jesus asks Peter,
[3308.64 --> 3310.64]  do you love me more than these?
[3310.90 --> 3313.18]  What do you think he's referring to?
[3316.92 --> 3318.06]  More than these.
[3318.12 --> 3319.64]  This is the sermon title for today.
[3320.14 --> 3322.02]  What is he referring to?
[3322.02 --> 3326.46]  As he's talking, as Jesus is talking to Peter,
[3327.24 --> 3328.58]  perhaps in this background,
[3329.08 --> 3330.72]  there's a beloved lake at the back.
[3332.28 --> 3334.68]  There's a boat with nets,
[3335.40 --> 3338.04]  signifying vocation, purpose.
[3338.80 --> 3341.56]  There are fish, a whole lot of fish,
[3342.52 --> 3343.94]  signifying food.
[3345.00 --> 3347.18]  And if they were to take this fish to the market,
[3347.28 --> 3348.48]  they could sell it for money.
[3348.48 --> 3351.86]  So also, it signifies money.
[3352.02 --> 3355.76]  We see the tools of the fishing trade.
[3355.88 --> 3358.14]  We see Peter's own fishing crew,
[3358.58 --> 3361.08]  his friends, his community,
[3361.88 --> 3363.40]  those buddies that if he says,
[3363.54 --> 3364.22]  let's go fishing,
[3364.42 --> 3365.94]  they would follow him in a heartbeat.
[3367.64 --> 3371.30]  We see all of that in this scene,
[3371.44 --> 3373.72]  all that is important to Peter.
[3374.52 --> 3375.40]  Food and income,
[3376.04 --> 3377.20]  vocation and livelihood,
[3377.20 --> 3378.56]  time and profit,
[3379.06 --> 3381.62]  community and companionship.
[3383.02 --> 3385.28]  Jesus, as he points to this entire picture,
[3385.40 --> 3386.98]  is asking Peter,
[3387.18 --> 3389.66]  do you love me more than these?
[3390.76 --> 3392.54]  Do you love me more than food?
[3392.92 --> 3394.14]  Although food is important.
[3394.54 --> 3395.88]  Do you love me more than money?
[3396.22 --> 3397.38]  Although money is important.
[3397.70 --> 3399.22]  Do you love me more than vocation?
[3399.38 --> 3400.68]  Although vocation is important.
[3400.92 --> 3402.56]  Do you love me more than community?
[3402.56 --> 3405.78]  He's asking Peter,
[3405.78 --> 3410.46]  do you love me more than all of these?
[3410.50 --> 3413.54]  All of these elements that make up life itself.
[3413.66 --> 3417.30]  Do you love me more than life itself?
[3417.30 --> 3424.36]  And just as Peter replies in the affirmative,
[3425.22 --> 3426.42]  three times he says,
[3426.58 --> 3426.88]  yes,
[3428.32 --> 3431.86]  each reply is also met with a triple charge.
[3432.36 --> 3433.58]  Feed my lambs.
[3434.58 --> 3436.08]  Take care of my sheep.
[3436.74 --> 3438.16]  Feed my sheep.
[3438.52 --> 3440.64]  In the same way Jesus was saying to Peter,
[3440.64 --> 3443.12]  that in the same way that you have learned from me,
[3443.58 --> 3444.60]  teach the flock.
[3444.84 --> 3448.06]  In the same way that you have experienced grace and forgiveness,
[3448.42 --> 3450.06]  extend grace and forgiveness.
[3450.06 --> 3452.72]  In the same way that you receive love,
[3453.16 --> 3455.74]  so also love the flock.
[3456.64 --> 3458.64]  Feed my sheep.
[3458.64 --> 3461.24]  And then Jesus says to him,
[3462.60 --> 3463.92]  follow me.
[3470.14 --> 3471.66]  This was the first call.
[3472.44 --> 3474.26]  Way back in Luke chapter 5.
[3475.22 --> 3476.48]  Repeated here also.
[3477.42 --> 3478.30]  Follow me.
[3481.48 --> 3482.24]  I think,
[3482.64 --> 3483.98]  when I think of this
[3483.98 --> 3486.82]  encounter between Jesus and Peter,
[3486.82 --> 3489.00]  I think he's inviting
[3489.00 --> 3492.04]  all who are reading this text today,
[3492.58 --> 3493.10]  you and I,
[3493.98 --> 3495.62]  he's inviting all of us
[3495.62 --> 3498.78]  to allow Jesus to be the singular love,
[3499.40 --> 3501.02]  the central person
[3501.02 --> 3504.24]  around which all other loves and affections
[3504.24 --> 3505.98]  find their rightful place.
[3507.56 --> 3509.50]  Some perhaps might look for,
[3510.28 --> 3511.30]  look towards food
[3511.30 --> 3513.22]  and have affection for food.
[3513.36 --> 3514.64]  Some might look towards income,
[3514.64 --> 3517.18]  money, vocation, community.
[3517.48 --> 3519.28]  And we seek to fill our hearts
[3519.28 --> 3520.56]  as much as we can
[3520.56 --> 3522.06]  with all of these things,
[3522.20 --> 3523.76]  but it's never enough.
[3524.84 --> 3526.18]  It's never enough.
[3526.86 --> 3527.72]  Sooner or later,
[3527.90 --> 3529.16]  these things that we put
[3529.16 --> 3530.58]  at the center of our lives,
[3530.66 --> 3531.60]  they disappoint us.
[3532.26 --> 3533.08]  Sooner or later,
[3533.48 --> 3534.48]  if we idolize
[3534.48 --> 3536.54]  and worship these things,
[3536.62 --> 3537.42]  they will disappoint.
[3538.28 --> 3539.30]  See, food, for example,
[3539.44 --> 3540.24]  food at the center,
[3540.32 --> 3541.14]  what does that look like?
[3541.20 --> 3542.76]  Well, that's the idolatry of food.
[3542.76 --> 3543.96]  Food, that's gluttony.
[3545.50 --> 3546.62]  Money at the center,
[3547.08 --> 3547.90]  well, that's greed.
[3548.90 --> 3549.80]  I mean, food and money,
[3549.90 --> 3550.20]  mind you,
[3550.28 --> 3551.94]  they are important for life,
[3552.14 --> 3553.84]  but if you put them at the center,
[3554.52 --> 3556.12]  they will distort your life.
[3557.26 --> 3558.96]  They do not belong at the center.
[3559.08 --> 3560.20]  They're important for life,
[3560.40 --> 3562.88]  but only God belongs at the center.
[3562.94 --> 3564.64]  If you put vocation at the center,
[3565.24 --> 3566.88]  well, it looks like workaholism
[3566.88 --> 3567.84]  and slave driving.
[3568.46 --> 3569.60]  Workaholism as it is
[3569.60 --> 3571.42]  an internalized thing.
[3571.52 --> 3573.00]  If vocation is idolatry,
[3573.50 --> 3575.18]  if vocation is idolized
[3575.18 --> 3577.42]  for the individual,
[3577.64 --> 3579.22]  that means working so hard
[3579.22 --> 3581.50]  that someone will respond to that,
[3581.60 --> 3582.82]  that someone will praise you
[3582.82 --> 3584.30]  or that someone would approve of you.
[3584.46 --> 3585.44]  Working so hard
[3585.44 --> 3586.30]  so that you might get,
[3586.56 --> 3586.88]  you know,
[3586.98 --> 3588.68]  that promotion
[3588.68 --> 3590.76]  or that pay increment,
[3590.94 --> 3591.84]  which is really hard
[3591.84 --> 3593.32]  in this particular season.
[3595.32 --> 3597.70]  That's vocation at the center,
[3597.70 --> 3599.48]  but when you express vocation
[3599.48 --> 3600.50]  outside of yourselves,
[3600.62 --> 3601.50]  that's slave driving,
[3602.00 --> 3603.58]  forcing people to work
[3603.58 --> 3606.08]  so that your team
[3606.08 --> 3607.30]  or your unit will,
[3607.38 --> 3607.60]  you know,
[3607.68 --> 3608.08]  I don't know,
[3608.12 --> 3609.06]  meet sales targets
[3609.06 --> 3610.88]  or meet whatever targets
[3610.88 --> 3612.06]  that have been set for your team.
[3612.62 --> 3613.82]  It's both workaholism
[3613.82 --> 3614.78]  and slave driving
[3614.78 --> 3616.98]  when we idolize vocation
[3616.98 --> 3617.64]  at the center.
[3619.16 --> 3620.26]  Community at the center,
[3620.38 --> 3621.44]  that's the idolatry
[3621.44 --> 3623.12]  of placing people above God
[3623.12 --> 3624.50]  in our affections.
[3624.84 --> 3625.30]  Now, mind you,
[3625.36 --> 3627.00]  community is important.
[3627.00 --> 3630.46]  That is how the church is designed.
[3630.56 --> 3632.00]  It is part of God's design,
[3632.26 --> 3633.20]  part of God's good work.
[3633.50 --> 3635.14]  But if community itself
[3635.14 --> 3637.34]  also is placed above God,
[3638.16 --> 3640.92]  then it starts to be an idolatry.
[3644.10 --> 3647.18]  Church starts being more about pickleball
[3647.18 --> 3649.04]  and potlucks
[3649.04 --> 3650.82]  than about worship,
[3650.96 --> 3654.50]  the worship of a marvelous,
[3654.82 --> 3656.52]  a holy, wonderful God.
[3658.00 --> 3659.60]  This text,
[3660.28 --> 3662.22]  brothers and sisters,
[3662.34 --> 3664.12]  is an invitation for us
[3664.12 --> 3665.80]  to put God at the center,
[3666.42 --> 3668.24]  to love God with our heart,
[3668.36 --> 3669.50]  soul, mind, and strength.
[3670.66 --> 3671.90]  It's not saying,
[3672.14 --> 3673.86]  do not love these other things,
[3674.00 --> 3675.62]  but allow these other loves
[3675.62 --> 3677.84]  to find their rightful place
[3677.84 --> 3680.94]  around the one central love
[3680.94 --> 3682.24]  that we have for God.
[3682.24 --> 3684.62]  everything else will follow.
[3685.22 --> 3686.30]  Brothers and sisters,
[3686.30 --> 3688.48]  this is my exhortation to you this morning.
[3689.30 --> 3691.72]  Know the love of Jesus.
[3692.86 --> 3695.78]  Know this love that preceded your own love.
[3696.20 --> 3698.90]  Know this love that exceeds your own love.
[3699.96 --> 3700.54]  Know him,
[3701.58 --> 3702.28]  this Jesus,
[3702.46 --> 3703.98]  he who knew no sin,
[3704.14 --> 3705.84]  who was made to be sin for us,
[3705.84 --> 3707.78]  so that in him we might be
[3707.78 --> 3710.00]  the righteousness of God.
[3710.00 --> 3711.56]  Know that love.
[3711.94 --> 3716.08]  Know that love that preceded all of our own affection
[3716.08 --> 3717.56]  and response to him.
[3718.00 --> 3719.62]  Behold what manner of love
[3719.62 --> 3720.94]  the Father has given,
[3721.28 --> 3722.64]  has bestowed upon us,
[3722.70 --> 3724.08]  that we should be called
[3724.08 --> 3726.74]  sons and daughters of God.
[3726.74 --> 3727.86]  It is that love.
[3729.56 --> 3730.82]  It is that love
[3730.82 --> 3732.22]  that expressed itself
[3732.22 --> 3734.34]  in coming to earth,
[3734.72 --> 3736.34]  being born as a baby,
[3736.86 --> 3737.42]  growing up,
[3737.66 --> 3738.46]  ministering
[3738.46 --> 3739.84]  in signs and wonders.
[3739.96 --> 3740.72]  It is that love
[3740.72 --> 3741.92]  that expresses itself
[3741.92 --> 3742.96]  on the cross.
[3743.00 --> 3743.66]  If you ask me,
[3743.74 --> 3745.30]  how much did Jesus love?
[3746.36 --> 3747.20]  This much.
[3748.66 --> 3749.52]  This much.
[3749.66 --> 3751.34]  Stretching out his arms on the cross.
[3752.30 --> 3753.82]  Giving up his life for ours.
[3753.98 --> 3755.56]  He lived the perfect life,
[3755.56 --> 3757.12]  the life we ought to have lived,
[3757.46 --> 3758.12]  and he died,
[3758.72 --> 3760.48]  the death we ought to have died
[3760.48 --> 3761.40]  on our behalf.
[3761.80 --> 3762.92]  For our sake,
[3763.06 --> 3764.48]  it is that love
[3764.48 --> 3766.78]  that we are being invited
[3766.78 --> 3768.88]  to respond to this morning.
[3770.00 --> 3771.36]  Know the love of Jesus
[3771.36 --> 3772.66]  and follow him.
[3773.42 --> 3775.12]  Respond to his divine initiative.
[3775.76 --> 3778.08]  Love him more than all of these.
[3778.56 --> 3780.20]  Love him more than food and income
[3780.20 --> 3781.68]  and vocation and community.
[3782.30 --> 3783.70]  Love the Lord your God
[3783.70 --> 3784.44]  with your heart,
[3784.44 --> 3785.18]  your soul,
[3785.44 --> 3786.38]  your mind and strength.
[3786.50 --> 3788.50]  Let him be your singular love.
[3788.60 --> 3789.84]  Let your affection for him
[3789.84 --> 3791.38]  be the central love
[3791.38 --> 3793.86]  around which all other loves
[3793.86 --> 3795.62]  find their rightful place.
[3795.78 --> 3798.38]  Love him more than these.
[3798.60 --> 3799.22]  Let us pray.
[3804.50 --> 3805.82]  Father, we thank you.
[3805.82 --> 3806.82]  love for your love.
[3806.82 --> 3807.82]  We thank you for your love.
[3807.82 --> 3816.28]  Love whose dimensions we cannot even begin to imagine.
[3817.62 --> 3820.14]  Love that precedes our own love.
[3820.88 --> 3824.78]  Love that exceeds in every way our own love.
[3824.78 --> 3825.78]  love that precedes our own love.
[3825.78 --> 3827.28]  We thank you for your love.
[3828.72 --> 3831.58]  We ask that each and every person here
[3831.58 --> 3834.26]  would know without a shadow of doubt
[3834.26 --> 3836.28]  that they are loved,
[3836.48 --> 3838.74]  that we are loved by you.
[3839.52 --> 3842.34]  And we ask that you give each one of us
[3842.34 --> 3846.02]  the ability to respond to you,
[3846.84 --> 3848.12]  heart, soul, mind and strength,
[3848.12 --> 3850.64]  to love you with all that we have,
[3850.74 --> 3852.70]  to love you more than these.
[3853.26 --> 3854.62]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[3855.46 --> 3855.76]  Amen.
[3858.34 --> 3859.94]  I'd like to invite us to stand
[3859.94 --> 3861.78]  as we sing the response song,
[3862.00 --> 3863.94]  Take My Life and Let It Be.
[3863.94 --> 3893.92]  Take My Life and Let It Be.
[3893.94 --> 3899.40]  Consecrated are to Thee.
[3899.40 --> 3904.90]  Take my moments and my days,
[3905.32 --> 3910.28]  let them flow in endless praise,
[3910.54 --> 3916.30]  let them flow in endless praise.
[3917.18 --> 3922.18]  Take my hands and let them move,
[3922.18 --> 3927.64]  not the impulse of Thy love.
[3927.64 --> 3933.24]  Take my feet and let them be
[3933.24 --> 3938.84]  swift and beautiful for Thee,
[3938.84 --> 3944.92]  swift and beautiful for Thee.
[3944.92 --> 3950.34]  Take my will and make it mine,
[3950.34 --> 3961.22]  take my heart, it is Thy love.
[3961.22 --> 3966.40]  It shall be Thy royal throne,
[3966.40 --> 3972.02]  it shall be Thy royal throne.
[3972.02 --> 3982.08]  Take my love, my Lord, I pour,
[3982.08 --> 3987.66]  let Thy feet its treasure store.
[3988.12 --> 3993.36]  Take myself and I will be
[3993.36 --> 3999.14]  ever, ever, only, all for Thee.
[3999.82 --> 4005.74]  Ever, only, all for Thee.
[4005.74 --> 4025.36]  We have the opportunity at this time to bring our financial gifts before God.
[4025.36 --> 4032.60]  And this Sunday's cause that we are supporting is called EduDeo.
[4032.60 --> 4034.46]  I was practicing this morning, I still can't say it.
[4035.24 --> 4037.40]  But it's hard to say, but it's a great cause.
[4037.84 --> 4047.46]  This is a Christian organization based in Canada that seeks to provide a Christ-centered education to developing countries around the world.
[4047.46 --> 4054.16]  It's a two-fold purpose, of course, spread the gospel and then help break the cycle of poverty in those countries through education.
[4054.16 --> 4057.54]  So, worthwhile cause and we take the offerings at this time.
[4057.54 --> 4058.48]  Amen.

[4117.54 --> 4119.54]  Amen.
[4147.54 --> 4151.88]  Please join me in prayer.
[4156.34 --> 4160.88]  Lord God, Father, we thank you for this time together this morning.
[4161.62 --> 4166.14]  To spend time together as a faith community and praise and worship of you is a blessing.
[4166.90 --> 4172.38]  We thank you for the summer season with the warm weather, its relatively relaxed pace,
[4172.38 --> 4178.86]  and the opportunities to get out and appreciate and enjoy your creation and to spend time with friends and family.
[4179.40 --> 4180.60]  It's a precious time of year.
[4181.34 --> 4186.72]  We pray that we can make use of this season to also rest in the cool shade of your presence,
[4187.20 --> 4191.24]  to pause, to see and feel your work in our lives.
[4192.60 --> 4196.54]  We give thanks for the message shared by Pastor Victor this morning,
[4196.54 --> 4203.78]  and we pray that we too can love you more than these and put you first in our lives.
[4205.34 --> 4211.08]  We give thanks for the recent rains and its rejuvenating effect on the forests and gardens.
[4211.80 --> 4218.18]  We pray that your rains will also reduce the damaging effects of the wildfires, both locally and across the country.
[4218.18 --> 4224.98]  We pray, Lord, for your wisdom to be extended to leaders across the world,
[4225.26 --> 4232.22]  that they may earnestly and truly seek a path forward to peace in regions such as Ukraine, Gaza,
[4232.68 --> 4234.64]  and the oft-forgotten conflict in Sudan.
[4235.84 --> 4240.34]  May your spirit guide discussions when they happen to end bloodshed
[4240.34 --> 4247.30]  and find ways to achieve just solutions and the rebuilding of lives shattered by years of conflict.
[4248.18 --> 4249.18]  May your spirit guide.
[4249.98 --> 4259.06]  Eternal and faithful God, as our congregation prepares to celebrate 75 years of your grace to this church community this fall,
[4259.40 --> 4263.58]  we pray for all of those that have come and gone from this community,
[4264.16 --> 4267.94]  some to serve you elsewhere, some to your eternal glory,
[4268.32 --> 4271.06]  and some, Lord, who drifted away from you altogether.
[4272.02 --> 4275.58]  It is these lost sheep that we pause to pray for.
[4275.58 --> 4278.60]  May your spirit work in their hearts.
[4279.30 --> 4285.98]  May we be part of that in planting seeds of faith that may yet sprout and grow through your intervention.
[4288.00 --> 4291.94]  We pray, Lord, for your healing hands to be on those suffering from illness,
[4292.32 --> 4293.74]  be it physical or mental.
[4294.62 --> 4299.18]  We pray for Michael Wayne DeVos and the cancer treatments he is going through.
[4299.18 --> 4302.86]  We pray for positive healing results from this therapy
[4302.86 --> 4307.92]  and for strength for all those supporting Michael in this difficult time.
[4309.48 --> 4314.38]  We pray for Wilma Vantall, who is both adjusting to her new home at Augustine House
[4314.38 --> 4318.66]  and dealing with ongoing pain that is yet to be fully understood by doctors.
[4319.32 --> 4321.28]  Please give her strength also.
[4321.28 --> 4325.78]  We pray for Edgar Wong's father in Hong Kong.
[4326.36 --> 4332.20]  May he be healed and may your comfort be extended to Edgar, Suzanne, Serena, and Sylvia
[4332.20 --> 4336.80]  as they all travel to Hong Kong to be near their father and grandfather.
[4340.00 --> 4343.36]  Merciful God, we pray you will also be near Robin's sister, Judy,
[4343.90 --> 4348.16]  who is suffering from MS, confined to a wheelchair and has difficulty communicating.
[4348.16 --> 4353.88]  Please give Judy and Robin strength on this difficult path that they walk together.
[4355.64 --> 4357.94]  Be near us, Lord, through this coming week.
[4358.98 --> 4361.06]  Help us to be effective servants to you
[4361.06 --> 4366.22]  and that the focus of our lives is to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
[4367.20 --> 4370.98]  We offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate name of Jesus,
[4371.52 --> 4372.26]  the light of the world.
[4372.70 --> 4372.90]  Amen.
[4378.16 --> 4386.88]  Sisters and brothers, please rise as I speak God's benediction over you.
[4390.26 --> 4395.02]  May you know the deep, deep love of Christ.
[4396.80 --> 4399.38]  And may you walk in that love.
[4400.66 --> 4405.16]  May you love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[4405.16 --> 4408.46]  May you love him more than all of these.
[4409.86 --> 4412.68]  Now unto him who is able to keep you from falling
[4412.68 --> 4417.62]  and to make you stand in his glorious presence, blameless and with great joy,
[4418.38 --> 4422.00]  to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[4422.46 --> 4426.76]  be the glory and the majesty, dominion and authority,
[4427.50 --> 4430.60]  before all time and now and forevermore.
[4431.00 --> 4431.34]  Amen.
[4431.34 --> 4431.46]  Amen.
[4435.16 --> 4452.16]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[4452.38 --> 4455.38]  Father, let your will be done.

[4459.18 --> 4461.86]  right here in my heart.

[4472.64 --> 4475.50]  right here in my heart.
[4476.40 --> 4479.38]  Give us this day a daily prayer.
[4480.14 --> 4481.32]  Forgive us.
[4481.80 --> 4482.38]  Forgive us.
[4482.38 --> 4482.96]  Forgive us.
[4483.42 --> 4488.18]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us.
[4488.18 --> 4489.02]  Forgive them.
[4489.02 --> 4489.32]  Forgive us.
[4489.32 --> 4489.84]  Forgive them.
[4489.84 --> 4493.88]  And lead us not into temptation.
[4494.40 --> 4499.76]  But deliver us from they for one.
[4500.78 --> 4503.32]  Let your kingdom come.
[4504.02 --> 4506.96]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[4507.32 --> 4510.18]  Father, let your will be done.
[4510.80 --> 4512.96]  On earth, those in heaven,
[4513.96 --> 4516.18]  right here in my heart.
[4516.18 --> 4520.32]  Father, let your kingdom come.
[4520.74 --> 4523.70]  Father, let your will be done.
[4523.70 --> 4526.40]  On earth, those in heaven,
[4526.40 --> 4530.54]  right here in my heart.
[4531.04 --> 4534.70]  Give us this day a daily prayer.
[4534.80 --> 4536.00]  Forgive us.
[4536.48 --> 4537.70]  Forgive us.
[4537.70 --> 4542.92]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us.
[4542.92 --> 4544.68]  Forgive them.
[4544.68 --> 4548.74]  And lead us not into temptation.
[4549.26 --> 4554.64]  But deliver us from they for one.
[4555.16 --> 4557.98]  Let your kingdom come.
[4559.18 --> 4560.48]  It's yours.
[4560.84 --> 4562.18]  It's yours.
[4562.52 --> 4563.84]  All yours.
[4564.16 --> 4565.48]  All yours.
[4565.48 --> 4572.02]  The kingdom, the power, the glory are yours.
[4572.44 --> 4573.70]  It's yours.
[4573.70 --> 4574.70]  It's yours.
[4574.70 --> 4575.42]  It's yours.

[4592.04 --> 4593.04]  All yours.
[4593.04 --> 4594.04]  All yours.

[4614.04 --> 4617.04]  Father, let your will be done.
[4617.04 --> 4622.04]  All yours.
[4622.04 --> 4622.80]  Human.
[4625.04 --> 4627.04]  What
[4627.10 --> 4630.04]  If you have not been granted, Christ, the power, the power, the bond, and now.
[4630.04 --> 4646.68]  will be done on earth as in heaven right here in my heart on earth as in heaven right here in my heart
[4660.04 --> 4667.10]  bow
[4667.10 --> 4673.42]  bow
[4673.42 --> 4675.42]  Amen.
