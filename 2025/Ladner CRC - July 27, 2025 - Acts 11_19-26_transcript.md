[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you for opening.
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 61.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 121.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 151.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 181.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 211.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 241.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 296.38]  Good morning.
[296.38 --> 297.38]  Good morning.
[297.38 --> 301.60]  You know, I expected to have the first 10 rows empty this morning, but we're quite a crowd
[301.60 --> 302.00]  today.
[302.26 --> 303.30]  I'm loving it.
[303.46 --> 306.54]  Not everybody is off on holidays, including us.
[307.96 --> 309.60]  Welcome to all of you.
[311.74 --> 315.62]  If you're visiting, welcome to you as well.
[315.70 --> 316.62]  And please stay afterward.
[316.74 --> 321.24]  We have coffee and tea after the service in the fellowship I'll haul behind.
[322.00 --> 325.94]  If you're watching on the YouTube channel, once again, you're not alone.
[325.94 --> 331.98]  I checked again yesterday, and we're still averaging 40 to 60 people that tune in every Sunday morning.
[332.06 --> 333.38]  So hello to you as well.
[336.54 --> 338.36]  There aren't many announcements this morning.
[338.84 --> 346.22]  The Bible reading bookmarks Dorothy mentioned for the next period of time are available today
[346.22 --> 348.10]  on the four-year-old.
[348.10 --> 357.90]  Our pastor today is George Kulon, and there might be a couple people who don't know who he is, but there can't be very many.
[357.90 --> 362.76]  There is one couple over there looking up saying, George, George who?
[363.26 --> 364.60]  That would be mom and dad.
[366.60 --> 371.24]  It's great to have George here this morning for all kinds of reasons.
[371.34 --> 377.04]  Not only his ability to preach to us, but the fact that he is here and in good health.
[377.10 --> 379.62]  He tells us this morning he's feeling at about 80%.
[379.62 --> 384.70]  Considering I'm about 70, 75, I would say that's pretty good.
[385.18 --> 389.08]  And the other piece of good news is he'll be here again next week.
[389.32 --> 392.98]  So we're glad to have him this morning.
[392.98 --> 401.08]  And he and Kerry are now members of the Fleetwood CRC, so it isn't too long a drive to get in here this morning.
[401.40 --> 402.78]  So, yeah, welcome, George.
[402.78 --> 412.12]  Speaking of people who are no strangers, we have Roger playing at the piano again this morning,
[412.18 --> 415.46]  and thanks once again for filling in during the summer months.
[418.88 --> 426.34]  Our call to worship is a responsive reading, and it's inspired by 1 Kings 18,
[426.58 --> 430.46]  a chapter which is interesting to read and involves the prophet Elijah.
[430.46 --> 435.96]  It's responsive, and as those of you who are regular members know,
[436.22 --> 439.88]  I'll start with a single arrow, and you'll jump in whenever there's a double arrow.
[442.82 --> 444.42]  Always there is a choice.
[445.30 --> 450.78]  The God of Christ Jesus or those material things for which this world will sell its soul.
[451.98 --> 453.72]  We cannot have it both ways.
[454.58 --> 457.18]  As the prophet Elijah declared long ago,
[457.18 --> 459.50]  How long does it take to make up your mind?
[459.60 --> 461.52]  If the Lord is God, then follow him.
[462.24 --> 466.12]  If idols are your gods, then admit you serve them.
[467.10 --> 467.90]  And we say,
[468.44 --> 471.08]  And greatly to be praised.
[471.64 --> 475.08]  He is to be honored above all worldly gods.
[475.66 --> 477.86]  We will declare God's glory
[477.86 --> 480.22]  and celebrate God's love
[480.22 --> 482.90]  among all the people on the earth.
[482.90 --> 491.26]  Allow me to lead you in our beginning opening word of prayer of adoration.
[491.62 --> 494.20]  We're asking for God's presence with us this morning.
[496.60 --> 500.24]  Blessed are you, Lord God, King of the earth and the universe.
[501.24 --> 506.58]  You have made all creation and made that known to us so that we can honor you.
[506.58 --> 511.84]  And today we do so again, joining with Christians worldwide.
[513.50 --> 517.04]  As we prepare to worship, we pray that you will quiet our hearts
[517.04 --> 519.88]  so that we may hear your voice in your word
[519.88 --> 523.30]  and in the words of your servant, Pastor George Keelan.
[525.26 --> 529.36]  Guide us in taking an honest look at ourselves.
[530.18 --> 533.40]  Shine a light on the places of our hearts that need repentance.
[533.40 --> 537.30]  We pray that you will accept and be glorified
[537.30 --> 540.12]  by the praise and prayers we offer you.
[540.84 --> 543.86]  We pray these things in the name of Jesus, the Christ,
[544.56 --> 547.96]  who with the Father and the Spirit is the true God.
[549.06 --> 549.44]  Amen.
[552.14 --> 558.38]  In return, the Lord's greeting comes to us from Isaiah 42, verses 6 to 8.
[558.38 --> 561.44]  I am the Lord.
[561.78 --> 563.68]  I have called you in righteousness.
[564.18 --> 566.20]  I have taken you by the hand and kept you.
[566.78 --> 569.72]  I have given you as a covenant to the people,
[570.32 --> 571.48]  a light to the nations,
[572.10 --> 573.80]  to open eyes that are blind.
[574.54 --> 575.44]  I am the Lord.
[575.76 --> 576.72]  That is my name.
[577.92 --> 579.70]  As God has greeted us,
[579.94 --> 581.28]  could you please stand if you're able
[581.28 --> 583.52]  and greet one another around you?
[583.52 --> 583.84]  Amen.
[583.84 --> 584.56]  Amen.
[585.16 --> 585.52]  Amen.
[585.52 --> 585.70]  Amen.
[586.40 --> 587.00]  Amen.
[587.00 --> 587.16]  Amen.
[587.16 --> 587.52]  Amen.
[588.38 --> 589.38]  Amen.
[618.38 --> 619.54]  Matthew 6 câlin室.
[619.54 --> 620.38]  Amen.
[620.38 --> 621.04]  Amen.
[621.04 --> 621.54]  Amen.
[621.54 --> 621.84]  Amen.
[621.84 --> 622.54]  Amen.
[622.54 --> 624.44]  Amen.
[624.44 --> 624.82]  Amen.
[624.90 --> 626.52]  Amen.
[626.52 --> 626.86]  Amen.
[628.02 --> 628.16]  Amen.
[628.70 --> 629.32]  Amen.
[629.38 --> 630.66]  Amen.
[630.66 --> 630.98]  Amen.
[630.98 --> 631.22]  Amen.
[631.38 --> 631.80]  Amen.
[632.34 --> 632.66]  Amen.
[632.66 --> 634.70]  Amen.
[634.70 --> 637.06]  Amen.
[637.54 --> 639.10]  Amen.
[639.10 --> 650.48]  our King. Make known the power of His grace, the beauty of His peace. Remember how His
[650.48 --> 661.28]  mercy reached when we cried out to Him. He lifted us to solid ground, to freedom from
[661.28 --> 673.40]  our sin. O sing, my soul, and tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled
[673.40 --> 675.14]  with His glory.
[681.62 --> 691.26]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our Lord. His power in us,
[691.28 --> 701.46]  is greater than, is greater than this world. To share the reason for our hope, to serve
[701.46 --> 713.62]  with love and grace. That all who see Him shine through us, I bring the Father praise. O sing,
[713.62 --> 723.80]  my soul, and tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[723.80 --> 751.80]  Lift high the name of Jesus, of Jesus our light. No other name on earth can sing and raise us so to light. He opens up our eyes to see the harvest He has grown.
[751.80 --> 772.80]  He labor in His fields of grace, as He leads sinners home. O sing, my soul, and tell all He's done, till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory.
[772.80 --> 774.80]  Jesus, all for Jesus.
[774.80 --> 802.78]  Jesus, all for Jesus.
[802.78 --> 811.78]  who I am and have and ever hope to be.
[811.78 --> 824.78]  All of my ambitions, hopes and plans, I surrender these into Your hands.
[824.78 --> 833.52]  For it's only in your will that I am free
[833.52 --> 842.28]  For it's only in your will that I am free
[842.28 --> 849.00]  Jesus, oh Lord Jesus
[849.00 --> 854.24]  All I am and have
[854.24 --> 857.86]  And ever hope to be
[857.86 --> 865.32]  Jesus, oh Lord Jesus
[865.32 --> 870.60]  All I am and have
[870.60 --> 874.12]  And ever hope to be
[874.12 --> 882.52]  All of my ambitions, hopes and plans
[882.52 --> 889.52]  I surrender these into your hands
[890.32 --> 897.52]  For it's only in your will that I am free
[897.52 --> 906.52]  For it's only in your will that I am free
[906.52 --> 913.52]  Jesus, all for Jesus
[913.52 --> 918.52]  All I am and have
[918.52 --> 921.52]  And ever hope to be
[921.52 --> 926.28]  You may be seated
[926.28 --> 942.74]  For the last, I think nearly two years
[942.74 --> 946.12]  Pastor Jason has introduced into our liturgy
[946.12 --> 948.24]  A scripture reading at this time of the service
[948.24 --> 950.62]  Very often, maybe always
[950.62 --> 953.06]  The scripture has nothing to do with the sermon that day
[953.06 --> 955.74]  It's just an opportunity to read some more of the Bible
[955.74 --> 957.48]  And reflect on it
[957.48 --> 959.98]  Then he left town
[959.98 --> 963.24]  And he usually picks it if you're not a worship leader
[963.24 --> 967.08]  And we just, you know, read whatever he tells us to
[967.08 --> 968.42]  He left town
[968.42 --> 970.32]  They're wandering around Vermont and Virginia
[970.32 --> 970.98]  I gather
[970.98 --> 973.28]  And left me no instructions
[973.28 --> 974.62]  So I was on my own this morning
[974.62 --> 977.52]  For picking something to read
[977.52 --> 980.36]  I chose Psalm 15
[980.36 --> 983.78]  It's a Psalm of David
[983.78 --> 985.98]  And it's quite uplifting
[985.98 --> 992.08]  I'll read it
[992.08 --> 992.82]  Since it's short
[992.82 --> 994.08]  I'll simply read it
[994.08 --> 998.10]  Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent
[998.10 --> 1001.04]  Who may live on your holy mountain
[1001.04 --> 1004.14]  The one whose walk is blameless
[1004.14 --> 1006.12]  Who does what is righteous
[1006.12 --> 1008.84]  Who speaks the truth from their heart
[1008.84 --> 1011.92]  Whose tongue utters no slander
[1011.92 --> 1014.32]  Who does no wrong to a neighbor
[1014.32 --> 1016.30]  And casts no slur on others
[1016.30 --> 1018.82]  Who despises a vile person
[1018.82 --> 1021.12]  But honors those that fear the Lord
[1021.12 --> 1023.26]  Who keep an oath even when it hurts
[1023.26 --> 1025.56]  And does not change their mind
[1025.56 --> 1028.94]  Who lends money to the poor without interest
[1028.94 --> 1031.78]  Who does not accept a bribe against the innocent
[1031.78 --> 1033.90]  Whoever does these things
[1033.90 --> 1035.44]  Will never be shaken
[1035.44 --> 1040.06]  Well, certainly can't argue with that
[1040.06 --> 1043.14]  There's an inclination, I think
[1043.14 --> 1044.84]  For us to say
[1044.84 --> 1047.66]  That probably describes us
[1047.66 --> 1050.20]  Because we believe all those things
[1050.20 --> 1053.44]  But I came across a confession
[1053.44 --> 1054.50]  A responsive reading
[1054.50 --> 1056.62]  That was structured as a prayer
[1056.62 --> 1057.78]  Inspired by a writer
[1057.78 --> 1059.64]  Who had a more honest look
[1059.64 --> 1061.62]  At Psalm 15
[1061.62 --> 1063.80]  And so
[1063.80 --> 1066.24]  Again, it's a responsive reading
[1066.24 --> 1070.08]  Holy God
[1070.08 --> 1071.94]  In fact, we do not deserve
[1071.94 --> 1073.42]  To be in your dwelling place
[1073.42 --> 1075.78]  We have not led
[1075.78 --> 1076.90]  A blameless life
[1076.90 --> 1079.22]  We have not always done
[1079.22 --> 1081.20]  What is right in your eyes
[1081.20 --> 1083.46]  Or always spoken the truth
[1083.46 --> 1085.80]  We have done wrong
[1085.80 --> 1087.46]  To both those we love
[1087.46 --> 1089.26]  And to those we don't love
[1089.26 --> 1090.14]  As we should
[1090.14 --> 1093.58]  We have not always been faithful stewards
[1093.58 --> 1095.12]  Of what has been given
[1095.12 --> 1096.56]  And blessed with
[1096.56 --> 1098.60]  And have sometimes hoarded
[1098.60 --> 1099.78]  What we should have shared
[1099.78 --> 1101.08]  With those less fortunate
[1101.08 --> 1103.80]  Hear our cry
[1103.80 --> 1104.96]  God of hope
[1104.96 --> 1106.80]  As we confess
[1106.80 --> 1107.92]  Our shortcomings
[1107.92 --> 1110.32]  Redeeming God
[1110.32 --> 1112.42]  Save us from your foolishness
[1112.42 --> 1114.04]  Our foolishness
[1114.04 --> 1115.64]  And guide us to your wisdom
[1115.64 --> 1118.14]  Forgive us
[1118.14 --> 1120.04]  We are humbly seeking
[1120.04 --> 1120.86]  Your light
[1120.86 --> 1122.48]  And your salvation
[1122.48 --> 1124.64]  Cleanse us
[1124.64 --> 1125.80]  Of our brokenness
[1125.80 --> 1127.68]  So that we might do justice
[1127.68 --> 1128.84]  Love kindness
[1128.84 --> 1130.46]  And walk humbly
[1130.46 --> 1131.64]  With you
[1131.64 --> 1139.90]  The words of assurance
[1139.90 --> 1142.22]  Well, I chose
[1142.22 --> 1144.24]  The last few verses
[1144.24 --> 1145.72]  Of the Old Testament book
[1145.72 --> 1146.34]  Of Micah
[1146.34 --> 1147.42]  After he offered
[1147.42 --> 1149.56]  Some stern warnings
[1149.56 --> 1150.52]  And prophecies
[1150.52 --> 1151.58]  To the people of Israel
[1151.58 --> 1153.60]  And the words
[1153.60 --> 1154.90]  Also apply to us
[1154.90 --> 1157.68]  Who is a God like you
[1157.68 --> 1159.28]  Who pardons sins
[1159.28 --> 1161.88]  And forgives transgressions
[1161.88 --> 1164.56]  You do not stay angry forever
[1164.56 --> 1166.70]  But delight to show mercy
[1166.70 --> 1169.52]  You will again have compassion on us
[1169.52 --> 1171.16]  You will tread our sins
[1171.16 --> 1172.58]  And underfoot
[1172.58 --> 1174.78]  And hurl all our iniquities
[1174.78 --> 1177.04]  Into the depths of the sea
[1177.04 --> 1180.44]  Our song of response
[1180.44 --> 1182.54]  Is first the river
[1182.54 --> 1184.02]  And then Lord I need you
[1184.02 --> 1203.36]  To the river
[1203.36 --> 1206.50]  I am going
[1206.50 --> 1209.38]  Bringing sins
[1209.38 --> 1212.38]  I cannot bear
[1212.38 --> 1216.26]  Come and cleanse me
[1216.26 --> 1219.38]  Come forgive me
[1219.38 --> 1221.38]  Lord I need
[1221.38 --> 1225.26]  To meet you there
[1225.26 --> 1231.26]  In these waters
[1231.26 --> 1234.42]  His healing mercy
[1234.42 --> 1237.22]  Flows with freedom
[1237.22 --> 1239.26]  From despair
[1239.26 --> 1243.26]  I am going
[1243.26 --> 1246.26]  To that river
[1246.26 --> 1249.26]  Lord I need
[1249.26 --> 1252.26]  To reach you there
[1252.26 --> 1253.26]  To hear
[1253.26 --> 1255.26]  Precious Jesus
[1255.26 --> 1259.26]  I am ready
[1259.26 --> 1261.26]  To surrender
[1261.26 --> 1262.26]  To surrender
[1262.26 --> 1265.26]  Every care
[1265.26 --> 1269.26]  Take my hand now
[1269.26 --> 1271.26]  Lead me closer
[1271.26 --> 1274.26]  Lord I need
[1274.26 --> 1277.26]  To reach you there
[1277.26 --> 1284.26]  Come and join us
[1284.26 --> 1287.26]  In the river
[1287.26 --> 1290.26]  Come find life
[1290.26 --> 1292.26]  Beyond compare
[1292.26 --> 1296.26]  He is calling
[1296.26 --> 1299.26]  He is waiting
[1299.26 --> 1300.26]  Jesus longs
[1300.26 --> 1301.26]  He is waiting
[1301.26 --> 1302.26]  Jesus longs
[1302.26 --> 1306.26]  To meet you there
[1306.26 --> 1307.26]  He is calling
[1307.26 --> 1309.26]  He is waiting
[1309.26 --> 1310.26]  He is waiting
[1310.26 --> 1311.26]  He is waiting
[1311.26 --> 1314.26]  Jesus longs
[1314.26 --> 1316.26]  To meet you there
[1316.26 --> 1318.26]  Precious Jesus
[1318.26 --> 1319.26]  Precious Jesus
[1319.26 --> 1320.26]  I am ready
[1320.26 --> 1321.26]  Precious Jesus
[1321.26 --> 1323.26]  I am ready
[1323.26 --> 1324.26]  To surrender
[1324.26 --> 1325.26]  To surrender
[1325.26 --> 1327.26]  Every care
[1327.26 --> 1329.26]  Take my hand now
[1329.26 --> 1331.26]  Lead me closer
[1331.26 --> 1333.26]  Lord I need
[1333.26 --> 1334.26]  To reach you there
[1334.26 --> 1335.26]  Take my hand now
[1335.26 --> 1336.26]  Lead me closer
[1336.26 --> 1337.26]  Lord I need
[1337.26 --> 1339.26]  To reach you there
[1339.26 --> 1340.26]  Lord I need
[1340.26 --> 1344.26]  To meet you there
[1344.26 --> 1346.26]  Take my hand now
[1346.26 --> 1349.26]  Lead me closer
[1349.26 --> 1352.26]  Lord I need
[1352.26 --> 1353.26]  To meet you there
[1353.26 --> 1354.26]  Lord I need
[1354.26 --> 1356.26]  To meet you there
[1356.26 --> 1372.26]  Lord I come
[1372.26 --> 1374.26]  I confess
[1374.26 --> 1376.26]  Now in here
[1376.26 --> 1379.26]  I find my rest
[1379.26 --> 1381.26]  Without you
[1381.26 --> 1382.26]  I am here
[1382.26 --> 1384.26]  I find my rest
[1384.26 --> 1386.26]  Without you
[1386.26 --> 1387.26]  Without you
[1387.26 --> 1390.26]  I fall apart
[1390.26 --> 1392.26]  You're the one
[1392.26 --> 1398.26]  That guides my heart
[1398.26 --> 1403.26]  Lord I need you
[1403.26 --> 1407.26]  Oh I need you
[1407.26 --> 1413.26]  Every hour I need you
[1413.26 --> 1415.26]  My one
[1415.26 --> 1417.26]  My one defense
[1417.26 --> 1419.26]  My righteousness
[1419.26 --> 1424.26]  Oh God how I need you
[1424.26 --> 1429.26]  Where sin runs deep
[1429.26 --> 1432.26]  Your grace is born
[1432.26 --> 1434.26]  Where grace is found
[1434.26 --> 1436.26]  Where grace is found
[1436.26 --> 1439.26]  Where grace is found
[1439.26 --> 1440.26]  Where grace is found
[1440.26 --> 1443.26]  Is where you are
[1444.26 --> 1445.26]  Where grace is found
[1445.26 --> 1449.26]  Where grace is found
[1449.26 --> 1450.26]  Where grace is found
[1450.26 --> 1452.26]  Where grace is found
[1452.26 --> 1454.26]  Where grace is found
[1454.26 --> 1455.26]  Where grace is found
[1455.26 --> 1456.26]  Where grace is found
[1456.26 --> 1457.26]  Where grace is found
[1457.26 --> 1459.26]  Is where you are
[1459.26 --> 1461.26]  Where grace is found
[1461.26 --> 1471.26]  Lord, I am free. Holiness is Christ in me.
[1474.26 --> 1487.26]  Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Every hour I need you.
[1487.26 --> 1498.26]  My one defense, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1498.26 --> 1503.26]  I need you.
[1503.26 --> 1507.26]  I need you.
[1507.26 --> 1511.26]  So take my soul to rise to you.
[1511.26 --> 1516.26]  When temptation comes my way.
[1517.26 --> 1522.26]  When I cannot stand, I fall on you.
[1522.26 --> 1529.26]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[1529.26 --> 1535.26]  When I cannot stand, I fall on you.
[1535.26 --> 1543.26]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[1543.26 --> 1557.26]  Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Every hour I need you.
[1557.26 --> 1570.26]  My one defense, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1570.26 --> 1577.26]  Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you.
[1577.26 --> 1582.26]  Every hour I need you.
[1582.26 --> 1584.26]  Every hour I need you.
[1584.26 --> 1598.26]  My one defense, my righteousness. Oh God, how I need you.
[1598.26 --> 1610.26]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1610.26 --> 1616.26]  This is the time for the young people, the younger class to leave for Sunday School this morning,
[1616.26 --> 1620.26]  ages three to grade three, and they may leave now.
[1620.26 --> 1626.26]  I see them storming out from the back.
[1626.26 --> 1630.26]  And with that, I welcome George Kulin to the pulpit.
[1642.26 --> 1644.26]  Well, good morning.
[1644.26 --> 1645.26]  Good morning.
[1645.26 --> 1647.26]  It is good to be here with you.
[1647.26 --> 1650.26]  I want to say again, but it's been quite a long time.
[1650.26 --> 1653.26]  I think maybe the last time I preached here was probably 2017, 2018.
[1653.26 --> 1658.26]  So it has been a number of years, but it is wonderful to be here.
[1658.26 --> 1664.26]  Again, for those who don't know, I grew up in this church, was born, baptized, and raised here.
[1664.26 --> 1668.26]  And so, yeah, it's just truly wonderful to be here.
[1668.26 --> 1672.26]  Carrie and I are so thankful for your faithful prayers,
[1672.26 --> 1676.26]  especially over the last six weeks, the three weeks I spent in hospital.
[1676.26 --> 1682.26]  As you can see, I lost some weight, lost about 14 pounds over three weeks.
[1682.26 --> 1684.26]  As for two and a half of those weeks, I couldn't eat anything.
[1684.26 --> 1687.26]  I was just kind of sitting in the hospital bed waiting for things to start working.
[1687.26 --> 1692.26]  But yeah, through the grace of God, through the prayers of his saints, such as you,
[1692.26 --> 1697.26]  we're on a good path now, and God has been faithful again.
[1697.26 --> 1703.26]  This morning what I'd like to do is something maybe a little bit different than a traditional sermon.
[1703.26 --> 1707.26]  I consider it kind of a summer sermon, taking things a little bit lighter.
[1707.26 --> 1712.26]  And what I want to do is do a bit of a profile on this guy, Barnabas,
[1712.26 --> 1715.26]  who pops up every once in a while in the Book of Acts.
[1715.26 --> 1721.26]  But he's kind of mainly a supporting character within the Book of Acts, within the early church.
[1721.26 --> 1723.26]  But what I want to do is kind of take a look at him.
[1723.26 --> 1725.26]  Who is he? What does he do?
[1725.26 --> 1727.26]  How does he speak to us of Christ?
[1727.26 --> 1730.26]  And how does he speak to us about ourselves?
[1730.26 --> 1733.26]  And so we're going to have a number of different passages that I'll be referring to
[1733.26 --> 1735.26]  and reading throughout the sermon.
[1735.26 --> 1740.26]  But our main passage, the lens we're going to use to look at this servant, Barnabas,
[1740.26 --> 1743.26]  is from Acts 11, beginning at verse 19.
[1743.26 --> 1748.26]  If you want to open your Bibles, I think you have it on your order of worship, the page number.
[1748.26 --> 1751.26]  But it'll also be on the screen behind me.
[1751.26 --> 1753.26]  If you are opening up your Bibles, I invite you to keep them open
[1753.26 --> 1758.26]  as we're going to kind of be flipping through quite a few different chapters within Acts.
[1758.26 --> 1763.26]  So Acts 11, beginning at verse 19.
[1763.26 --> 1770.26]  And I invite you just to really pay attention to the character of Barnabas.
[1770.26 --> 1771.26]  It says,
[1771.26 --> 1776.26]  Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed
[1776.26 --> 1782.26]  traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, spreading the word among the Jews.
[1782.26 --> 1787.26]  Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch
[1787.26 --> 1792.26]  and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
[1792.26 --> 1798.26]  The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
[1798.26 --> 1804.26]  News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
[1804.26 --> 1813.26]  When he arrived, he saw what the grace of God had done, and was glad, and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their heart.
[1813.26 --> 1821.26]  He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
[1821.26 --> 1825.26]  Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul.
[1825.26 --> 1827.26]  And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
[1827.26 --> 1833.26]  So for a whole year, Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people.
[1833.26 --> 1838.26]  The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
[1838.26 --> 1840.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1840.26 --> 1846.26]  Now who is this guy, Barnabas?
[1846.26 --> 1850.26]  Well, we know actually a little bit about him.
[1850.26 --> 1852.26]  He's not totally anonymous.
[1852.26 --> 1856.26]  I didn't realize this until I started studying kind of for this sermon.
[1856.26 --> 1862.26]  But the first time we come across this character, Barnabas, is all the way back in Acts 4.
[1862.26 --> 1864.26]  Acts 4, verse 36.
[1864.26 --> 1865.26]  It says,
[1865.26 --> 1883.26]  Now there's a couple facts we can pick up about Barnabas from this one verse.
[1883.26 --> 1885.26]  First, he was a Levite.
[1885.26 --> 1895.26]  So he has kind of died in the cast, a true Jewish person who was brought up on the island of Cyprus, which is of course off the Mediterranean coast.
[1895.26 --> 1897.26]  So he was both kind of an insider.
[1897.26 --> 1899.26]  He was a Levite.
[1899.26 --> 1904.26]  But he wasn't born or raised in Judea, which also made him a bit of an outsider.
[1904.26 --> 1911.26]  He is dubbed Barnabas by the other apostles, which means son of encouragement, which speaks to his character.
[1911.26 --> 1915.26]  And we're going to hear about a lot in the next number during this sermon.
[1915.26 --> 1920.26]  And he sold a field he owned and he brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.
[1920.26 --> 1922.26]  He sold a field, so he owned land.
[1922.26 --> 1926.26]  So he wasn't from a true priestly family, as usually the Levites were.
[1926.26 --> 1930.26]  He was an owner of property.
[1930.26 --> 1934.26]  But he was still, it seems, a very devout Jewish person.
[1934.26 --> 1940.26]  Now this is kind of where we get into a bit of a speculation about who this Barnabas was, how old he was,
[1940.26 --> 1943.26]  and kind of what he did before we pick up on his life in Acts.
[1943.26 --> 1948.26]  But most people speculate and believe that Barnabas was a follower of Jesus.
[1948.26 --> 1951.26]  He was probably actually a disciple of Jesus.
[1951.26 --> 1959.26]  Of course, not one of the core twelve, but he was probably, most people think, one of the seventy-two who we read about in Acts 10,
[1959.26 --> 1961.26]  who were sent out by Jesus.
[1961.26 --> 1966.26]  But he was most likely a contemporary of Jesus and a follower of Jesus.
[1966.26 --> 1974.26]  But the most definitive idea we get about who Barnabas was, was found in our text in verse 24.
[1974.26 --> 1979.26]  He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.
[1979.26 --> 1985.26]  And we're going to kind of take this description and we're going to look at three acts in the life of Barnabas
[1985.26 --> 1989.26]  to see who he was, what did he do, and what was his legacy.
[1989.26 --> 1994.26]  And the first act we're going to kind of look out and that's recorded within Acts,
[1994.26 --> 2002.26]  is that he was someone who had faith in the work of the Holy Spirit in other people's lives.
[2002.26 --> 2008.26]  And the first life that he comes into contact with, really, is the life of Saul.
[2008.26 --> 2010.26]  Now we have to remember who Saul was.
[2010.26 --> 2015.26]  Saul, who later is named Paul, was a persecutor of the church.
[2015.26 --> 2019.26]  He was a leader among leaders in the Jewish hierarchy.
[2019.26 --> 2025.26]  And he oversaw and approved of the killing of Stephen that we read about in Acts 8.
[2025.26 --> 2031.26]  And Saul was actually the architect of the persecution that sent people out,
[2031.26 --> 2033.26]  that we read about in Acts 11.
[2033.26 --> 2040.26]  Saul was the architect of that persecution that sent people out to Cyprus and Cyrene and eventually to Antioch.
[2040.26 --> 2047.26]  But what we also know about Saul is he had this dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus,
[2047.26 --> 2049.26]  where Jesus appeared to him.
[2049.26 --> 2056.26]  And now, it's a little while later, we pick it up in Acts 9, that he shows up in Jerusalem.
[2056.26 --> 2059.26]  And he wants to join the leaders within Jerusalem.
[2059.26 --> 2063.26]  He wants to join the church that is being formed within Jerusalem.
[2063.26 --> 2067.26]  But the leaders of the church in Jerusalem don't trust him.
[2067.26 --> 2070.26]  They don't trust the work of the Spirit.
[2070.26 --> 2072.26]  In Acts 9, verse 26, it says,
[2072.26 --> 2077.26]  When he, Saul, came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples.
[2077.26 --> 2081.26]  But they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
[2081.26 --> 2085.26]  But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles.
[2085.26 --> 2092.26]  He told them how Saul, on his journey, had seen the Lord, and the Lord had spoken to him.
[2092.26 --> 2100.26]  Peter, James, John, they had heard reports of Saul, both as a persecutor and that maybe he had converted.
[2100.26 --> 2104.26]  But they asked themselves, could this really be true?
[2104.26 --> 2110.26]  They were skeptical of this testimony of the Spirit's work in his life.
[2110.26 --> 2116.26]  And I think we need to pause and ask ourselves, are we not sometimes like that?
[2116.26 --> 2120.26]  We hear and we see maybe, or we hear the work of the Spirit in someone else's life.
[2120.26 --> 2122.26]  Someone has a conversion.
[2122.26 --> 2125.26]  But then we ask, yeah, but really?
[2125.26 --> 2127.26]  Did that actually happen?
[2127.26 --> 2131.26]  But Barnabas has faith.
[2131.26 --> 2135.26]  And he steps into that gap of fear.
[2135.26 --> 2139.26]  He had faith in the work of the Spirit in the lives of other people.
[2139.26 --> 2143.26]  And he lays aside the fears of the disciples, and he has faith in God's work.
[2143.26 --> 2151.26]  And he goes and he finds Saul in Jerusalem, and he brings him into the inner circle of the leaders, the inner circle of the church.
[2151.26 --> 2154.26]  He brings him in from the cold and from the loneliness.
[2154.26 --> 2163.26]  Saul, at this time, was still young in his faith, and he needed the support and discipleship himself that he could get from Peter and John and James.
[2163.26 --> 2167.26]  And Barnabas goes to find him and to bring him in.
[2167.26 --> 2173.26]  Barnabas comes open-hearted, and he quietly steps into the gap between the disciples and Saul.
[2173.26 --> 2178.26]  And he offers him grace and encouragement where others judged.
[2178.26 --> 2183.26]  He offered faith where others were skeptical and feared.
[2183.26 --> 2190.26]  Then we have a second kind of act in the life of Barnabas, which is from the text we read.
[2190.26 --> 2195.26]  It happens two chapters later, of course, in Acts 11.
[2195.26 --> 2201.26]  But what happens between this first introduction of Saul and now this church in Antioch is about five years.
[2201.26 --> 2206.26]  Five years kind of are between these two different acts in the life of Barnabas.
[2206.26 --> 2212.26]  And after this kind of interaction with Saul, the book of Acts kind of turns to the acts of Peter.
[2212.26 --> 2216.26]  And a huge transition begins to happen during this intermediate time.
[2216.26 --> 2222.26]  And that is that the gospel and the spirit begins to come among the Gentiles.
[2222.26 --> 2229.26]  The spirit begins to move out from the centuries of Jewish faith into its worldwide kingdom of God.
[2229.26 --> 2234.26]  This kingdom of God begins to manifest itself among the Gentile people.
[2234.26 --> 2237.26]  And it begins with Peter in Acts 10.
[2237.26 --> 2241.26]  Peter has this vision of meat, of food, coming down from heaven on a sheet.
[2241.26 --> 2247.26]  And as soon as he wakes up from this vision, he is called by the house of Cornelius to go there to minister to them.
[2247.26 --> 2251.26]  And the spirit is poured out on this Roman family, on these Gentile people.
[2251.26 --> 2255.26]  And Peter baptizes them because he sees what the spirit is doing.
[2255.26 --> 2262.26]  After this, Peter is recalled to Jerusalem and he has to testify before the court about what he did.
[2262.26 --> 2264.26]  And the church rejoices.
[2264.26 --> 2267.26]  But the spirit doesn't stop with this one family.
[2267.26 --> 2271.26]  See, as people were scattered, as our text said, from the persecution of Saul,
[2271.26 --> 2276.26]  as people were scattered kind of along that whole east coast of the Mediterranean,
[2276.26 --> 2280.26]  a critical mass of people actually begins to form in Antioch.
[2280.26 --> 2284.26]  A critical mass of Greek-speaking people, Gentiles, begins to form.
[2284.26 --> 2286.26]  A new church begins to form.
[2286.26 --> 2288.26]  And then we have our text.
[2288.26 --> 2291.26]  And we read in Acts 11, verse 20 again.
[2291.26 --> 2298.26]  Some of them, these scattered believers, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch
[2298.26 --> 2303.26]  and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
[2303.26 --> 2305.26]  The Lord's hand was with them.
[2305.26 --> 2308.26]  And a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
[2308.26 --> 2313.26]  News of this reached the church in Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
[2313.26 --> 2316.26]  When he arrived, he saw what the grace of God had done.
[2316.26 --> 2317.26]  And he was glad.
[2317.26 --> 2322.26]  And he encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their heart.
[2324.26 --> 2329.26]  The church leaders in Jerusalem once again recognize that something new is happening.
[2329.26 --> 2333.26]  And therefore, they feel they need to send a delegate to Antioch,
[2333.26 --> 2338.26]  a delegate from the church in Jerusalem out to this far-off place to see what is happening.
[2338.26 --> 2342.26]  And this is an incredible critical moment in the early church.
[2342.26 --> 2345.26]  The Spirit was no doubt on the move.
[2345.26 --> 2348.26]  And they needed to pick the right person to go.
[2348.26 --> 2358.26]  And in the providence of God, they chose Barnabas, this son of encouragement, a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith.
[2358.26 --> 2359.26]  And so he goes.
[2359.26 --> 2360.26]  And what happens?
[2360.26 --> 2362.26]  Verse 23.
[2362.26 --> 2363.26]  Verse 23.
[2363.26 --> 2367.26]  When he arrived, he saw what the grace of God had done.
[2367.26 --> 2372.26]  And he was glad and encouraged them to remain true to the Lord with all their heart.
[2372.26 --> 2374.26]  He saw the Spirit was at work.
[2374.26 --> 2376.26]  He saw what the grace of God was doing.
[2376.26 --> 2380.26]  And he rejoices in God's grace to these Greek outsiders.
[2380.26 --> 2385.26]  And he encouraged them to remain true to the Lord with all their heart.
[2385.26 --> 2388.26]  It's such simple discipleship.
[2388.26 --> 2391.26]  He saw what the grace of God was doing.
[2391.26 --> 2393.26]  He encouraged it.
[2393.26 --> 2397.26]  Just like he had done many years before with the life of Saul.
[2397.26 --> 2399.26]  He saw the Spirit at work.
[2399.26 --> 2403.26]  And he goes out and simply encourages it.
[2403.26 --> 2406.26]  But there's one more thing he then does.
[2406.26 --> 2408.26]  In verse 25 of our text.
[2408.26 --> 2412.26]  Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look again for Saul.
[2412.26 --> 2414.26]  And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
[2414.26 --> 2419.26]  So for a whole year, Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people.
[2419.26 --> 2422.26]  His disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
[2422.26 --> 2425.26]  What Barnabas does is he doesn't keep this for himself.
[2425.26 --> 2427.26]  He doesn't try to form it in his own image.
[2427.26 --> 2431.26]  But what he actually does is he goes a couple cities over in southern Turkey.
[2431.26 --> 2434.26]  And once again, he hunts down Saul.
[2434.26 --> 2436.26]  And he brings him over with him.
[2436.26 --> 2441.26]  And with Barnabas kind of at the helm, the two of them minister in Antioch for a whole year.
[2441.26 --> 2447.26]  Barnabas, again, recognized the work of the Spirit in Saul's life many years earlier.
[2447.26 --> 2452.26]  And then here in Antioch, he recognized the work of the Spirit within the city.
[2452.26 --> 2453.26]  And he says, you know what?
[2453.26 --> 2456.26]  The two of these need to be brought together.
[2456.26 --> 2458.26]  And they stay then for a whole year.
[2458.26 --> 2461.26]  And they preach the lordship of Jesus Christ.
[2461.26 --> 2464.26]  They preach the foundation of Christ, the anointed one.
[2464.26 --> 2467.26]  The Messiah who had come for the whole world.
[2467.26 --> 2469.26]  And something happens.
[2469.26 --> 2475.26]  This word for the first time, Christ, begins to appear on the lips of these Gentile people.
[2475.26 --> 2480.26]  And it's here that the believers of Jesus are first called Christians.
[2480.26 --> 2482.26]  The Christ ones.
[2482.26 --> 2492.26]  And it is from here then that the church sees the work of Barnabas and Saul.
[2492.26 --> 2496.26]  And it says, these guys need to be sent out.
[2496.26 --> 2509.26]  In Acts 13 verse 2, it says, while they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
[2509.26 --> 2515.26]  And this is the first official missionary journey of the church.
[2515.26 --> 2524.26]  It begins with this simple discipleship of Barnabas calling Saul and the two of them living here in Antioch.
[2524.26 --> 2529.26]  But something special happens in Acts 13.
[2529.26 --> 2531.26]  And it's very subtle.
[2531.26 --> 2536.26]  You'll have to read it maybe when you get home to see kind of exactly what I'm talking about.
[2536.26 --> 2546.26]  But in Acts 13, Barnabas begins to turn the reins over to Saul, who is now called Paul.
[2546.26 --> 2551.26]  You see, in the Greek language, sentence structure is very important.
[2551.26 --> 2556.26]  The Greek writers, they would always put the most important things of a sentence in the beginning.
[2556.26 --> 2563.26]  Or when they were listing names, they would say the most important name first, and then the less important stuff second at the end of the sentence.
[2563.26 --> 2577.26]  And up until now in the book of Acts, and also in the first chapter 13, whenever Paul and Barnabas are talking about, it's always listed as Barnabas and Saul.
[2577.26 --> 2582.26]  Barnabas is always first as the teacher and Saul as the protege.
[2582.26 --> 2586.26]  But halfway through chapter 13, there's a change.
[2586.26 --> 2593.26]  And we begin to read after Saul is renamed Paul, which most likely Barnabas did, the names are switched.
[2593.26 --> 2597.26]  It says Paul and Barnabas from here on out.
[2597.26 --> 2603.26]  During this missionary journey, Barnabas gets out of the way.
[2603.26 --> 2607.26]  And he allows Paul to come to the front and lead.
[2607.26 --> 2612.26]  Once again, showing his name, the son of encouragement.
[2612.26 --> 2615.26]  And it's here we can also almost hear the echo of John the Baptist,
[2615.26 --> 2620.26]  I must become less so he can become more.
[2620.26 --> 2631.26]  And this then brings us to the final act in the life of Barnabas, something which is quite often overlooked or almost seemed negatively.
[2631.26 --> 2635.26]  Acts 15, beginning at verse 36.
[2635.26 --> 2636.26]  It says,
[2636.26 --> 2639.26]  Sometime later, Paul said to Barnabas,
[2639.26 --> 2646.26]  Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they were doing.
[2646.26 --> 2651.26]  Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.
[2651.26 --> 2658.26]  But Baal did not think it wise to take him because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and not continued with them in the work.
[2658.26 --> 2662.26]  They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company.
[2662.26 --> 2665.26]  And Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus.
[2665.26 --> 2674.26]  Now, we don't know the conditions of how or why Mark left them on their first missionary journey.
[2674.26 --> 2679.26]  What we hear about in other parts of Acts is that Mark was in Antioch.
[2679.26 --> 2683.26]  In Acts 11, when Saul and Barnabas were in Antioch, Mark was also there.
[2683.26 --> 2691.26]  And Paul and Barnabas, they take Mark with them when they're done and they take him back to Jerusalem.
[2691.26 --> 2697.26]  And Mark goes out with them on their first missionary journey in Acts 13 and 14.
[2697.26 --> 2699.26]  But somewhere on this journey, he deserted them.
[2699.26 --> 2704.26]  He left them and this left a very sour taste in Paul's mouth.
[2704.26 --> 2712.26]  In Acts verse 15, as we read, Paul and Barnabas, they want to go out on a second missionary journey to encourage the churches they had already been at.
[2712.26 --> 2715.26]  But it is here we read that they part ways.
[2715.26 --> 2725.26]  But it is also here that once again, we see the faith and the recognition of the Spirit at work in another person's life.
[2725.26 --> 2737.26]  And what Barnabas does, what he wants to do here, is simply offer to Mark the same faith and grace that he had offered to Saul so many years before.
[2737.26 --> 2742.26]  But this is the last we hear of Barnabas in the book of Acts.
[2742.26 --> 2746.26]  From here on out, it is only Paul who chooses Silas.
[2746.26 --> 2751.26]  And he goes off and Barnabas chose Mark and they go back to Cyprus.
[2751.26 --> 2759.26]  Now quite often, I think when we read this or maybe just this morning, we need to ask, did Barnabas choose wrong?
[2759.26 --> 2762.26]  Is this why we no longer hear about him?
[2762.26 --> 2767.26]  From here on out, as I said, it's all about Paul and Silas and later on, Timothy.
[2767.26 --> 2770.26]  Did Barnabas choose wrong?
[2770.26 --> 2772.26]  Well, I don't think so.
[2772.26 --> 2778.26]  But all we are left with and what we know is that Barnabas saw something in Mark.
[2778.26 --> 2781.26]  He once again saw the Spirit at work.
[2781.26 --> 2793.26]  Now here we are going to change gears and I think we have to pause and ask, why is Barnabas even relevant to our faith today?
[2793.26 --> 2795.26]  To our faith in Christ?
[2795.26 --> 2800.26]  Barnabas, when you kind of look at him on a surface level, didn't actually do great things.
[2800.26 --> 2801.26]  He's not Paul.
[2801.26 --> 2803.26]  He's not Peter.
[2803.26 --> 2805.26]  He's not even James or John.
[2805.26 --> 2812.26]  He's never mentioned in the Gospels and he was quite, really quite kind of an ordinary person.
[2812.26 --> 2816.26]  His gifts were that of an encourager, which I think a lot of us here have.
[2816.26 --> 2821.26]  It says he was full of faith, as all of us here are today.
[2821.26 --> 2825.26]  And he was a person full of the Spirit, as we are as well.
[2825.26 --> 2828.26]  Like you and me, he was quite an ordinary person.
[2828.26 --> 2832.26]  A man of faith who encouraged a lot of people.
[2832.26 --> 2839.26]  And yet it is out of that, that he actually has an incredible legacy, if you really think about it.
[2839.26 --> 2842.26]  For what do we know about Mark?
[2842.26 --> 2846.26]  This guy that Barnabas takes under his wing.
[2846.26 --> 2852.26]  Well, he eventually goes on and becomes the first Gospel writer.
[2852.26 --> 2859.26]  He is the first one to put pen to paper about the life and death of Jesus.
[2859.26 --> 2862.26]  Now Mark was not one of the disciples of Jesus.
[2862.26 --> 2863.26]  He was too young.
[2863.26 --> 2868.26]  He was probably a preteen or a teenager while Jesus walked on the earth.
[2868.26 --> 2874.26]  In Mark 24, 51, we read about this boy who fled naked on the night that Jesus was betrayed.
[2874.26 --> 2880.26]  And most people believe that this was Mark writing himself into his Gospel.
[2880.26 --> 2883.26]  Mark was most likely just a boy, a teenager, when Jesus lived.
[2883.26 --> 2888.26]  But Barnabas, however, it is widely believed, was a contemporary of Jesus.
[2888.26 --> 2894.26]  Considering how early he is within the church, his donation, how he understood what the church needed,
[2894.26 --> 2898.26]  Barnabas probably knew and witnessed the life of Jesus.
[2898.26 --> 2904.26]  And it was Barnabas then who took Mark, who had faith in Mark, who saw the Spirit doing something in Mark's life,
[2904.26 --> 2907.26]  and he took him under his wing.
[2907.26 --> 2914.26]  And in addition, of course, to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that is always at work in the writing of the Gospel and Scripture,
[2914.26 --> 2921.26]  we also, I think, have to wonder what was Barnabas talking about on that journey with Mark?
[2921.26 --> 2923.26]  All that time he spent with Mark.
[2923.26 --> 2925.26]  What did Mark hear from him?
[2925.26 --> 2934.26]  Was it not the life, the teachings, the healings, the death and resurrection of Jesus that Barnabas would have been teaching him about
[2934.26 --> 2936.26]  and teaching the church about?
[2936.26 --> 2941.26]  Was it not from these teachings then that Mark would have learned and heard more about the life of Christ,
[2941.26 --> 2945.26]  about what his death and resurrection truly meant for the Kingdom of God,
[2945.26 --> 2948.26]  which is such a theme in Mark's Gospel?
[2948.26 --> 2952.26]  Could not the teachings of Barnabas inspired him to write his Gospel,
[2952.26 --> 2957.26]  the first written account of Jesus' life and work?
[2957.26 --> 2961.26]  And the same then goes for Saul, or Paul.
[2961.26 --> 2968.26]  Now we can't discount, of course, that Paul had the miraculous encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus.
[2968.26 --> 2971.26]  Paul was filled with the Spirit.
[2971.26 --> 2976.26]  He was one, as Acts said, who was especially chosen by God to go to the Gentiles.
[2976.26 --> 2979.26]  But once again, we need to wonder.
[2979.26 --> 2982.26]  Since Paul did not travel and know Jesus personally,
[2982.26 --> 2987.26]  what was the impact of this humble man, Barnabas, on his life?
[2987.26 --> 2993.26]  Barnabas, twice, bridges the gap between the church and Saul and brings him in.
[2993.26 --> 2997.26]  He first brings him into Jerusalem to meet with the apostles, with the disciples,
[2997.26 --> 2999.26]  receiving their teaching and support.
[2999.26 --> 3004.26]  And then Barnabas goes to Tarsus, a way, a kind of a city that was kind of a backwater place,
[3004.26 --> 3008.26]  and brings Saul to Tarsus, where then they are sent out.
[3008.26 --> 3014.26]  And it is from here and from these Acts of Barnabas that Paul then becomes the missionary that we know.
[3014.26 --> 3021.26]  And from those missionary journeys, he writes his letters, that which we know as the epistles of the New Testament,
[3021.26 --> 3025.26]  what we base so much of our Orthodox faith on.
[3025.26 --> 3038.26]  If we allow ourselves to wonder a little bit, it's actually very astonishing what the legacy of this humble, ordinary follower of Jesus was.
[3038.26 --> 3044.26]  But brothers and sisters, we don't just focus, of course, on Barnabas.
[3044.26 --> 3050.26]  For what we witness in Barnabas is, of course, not just himself.
[3050.26 --> 3057.26]  But what we focus on and see in Barnabas is, of course, the work of Jesus Christ.
[3057.26 --> 3065.26]  For friends, is it not Christ who reaches out to us and who invites us into his presence?
[3065.26 --> 3072.26]  See, as Barnabas went and stood in that gap and brought Saul into the Jerusalem church,
[3072.26 --> 3082.26]  do we not believe that is it not Christ who comes to us, who invites us in from the cold, who invites us in from our loneliness?
[3082.26 --> 3090.26]  Is it not Christ, as we professed this morning, who welcomes us and calls us each and every week and within our faith into his church?
[3090.26 --> 3095.26]  Is it not Christ who calls us and who seals his call and his grace in our baptism?
[3095.26 --> 3099.26]  Is it not Christ who welcomes us to his holy table?
[3099.26 --> 3107.26]  And is it not Christ who will one day welcome each and every one of us into his eternal kingdom,
[3107.26 --> 3112.26]  from the exile of this world into our eternal home in heaven?
[3112.26 --> 3116.26]  And is it not Christ through his spirit who grows the church?
[3116.26 --> 3122.26]  You see, as Barnabas goes out as a delegate of the church, it is still the spirit who is going out constantly in front of him,
[3122.26 --> 3124.26]  who is doing the work.
[3124.26 --> 3132.26]  It is not our fancy words or our arguments or our deeds or debates that change lives, but it is the spirit.
[3132.26 --> 3143.26]  And we are invited, yes, along to give witness and encouragement to the work of Jesus, but it is Jesus and the spirit who grow his church out in front of us.
[3143.26 --> 3149.26]  And when we see that, we're called to rejoice and to encourage that work.
[3149.26 --> 3156.26]  It is the Holy Spirit that is anew every morning, out in front, transforming and leading.
[3156.26 --> 3166.26]  And it is, of course, friends, Christ, most important, who time and time again offers us his grace.
[3166.26 --> 3172.26]  As Barnabas extended his hand and olive branch his grace to Mark to bring him back in again,
[3172.26 --> 3179.26]  so too it is Christ who time and time again, as we desert him in our sin,
[3179.26 --> 3184.26]  as we turn from him daily through actions and speech and thought,
[3184.26 --> 3191.26]  it is he who holds out to us his grace and his love through the cross.
[3191.26 --> 3200.26]  It is Jesus on the cross who stands in the ultimate gap, the gap between our sin and the love of the Father.
[3200.26 --> 3206.26]  And it is Jesus on the cross who brings us into his eternal presence.
[3208.26 --> 3216.26]  You see, Barnabas didn't have the Jewish education or prestige or conversion experience that Paul had.
[3216.26 --> 3222.26]  He didn't have the commission that Peter had from Jesus that on this rock I will build my church.
[3222.26 --> 3227.26]  And he didn't even have the intimate friendship that John had with Jesus, the one whom Jesus loved.
[3227.26 --> 3232.26]  Barnabas never actually stepped up to be a leader.
[3232.26 --> 3235.26]  He was simply called to follow.
[3235.26 --> 3238.26]  And we don't think of him even as a leader.
[3238.26 --> 3241.26]  Peter, James, and John were the leaders of the very early church.
[3241.26 --> 3244.26]  Paul and Timothy were leaders after that.
[3244.26 --> 3248.26]  But Barnabas simply followed in faith.
[3248.26 --> 3252.26]  He followed simply the work of the Spirit.
[3252.26 --> 3259.26]  And he never knew the impact of his life on the early church or on our church today.
[3260.26 --> 3265.26]  Barnabas, as we know, is not a main character.
[3265.26 --> 3268.26]  Barnabas is part of the supporting cast.
[3268.26 --> 3273.26]  And the truth is that none of us are the main character.
[3273.26 --> 3276.26]  We're all part of a supporting cast.
[3276.26 --> 3282.26]  We are all supporting characters of Jesus' work of the Spirit.
[3282.26 --> 3288.26]  We are all simply called to be people of faith and the Spirit who follow.
[3288.26 --> 3292.26]  We are called to recognize the work of the Spirit in our life,
[3292.26 --> 3295.26]  but also the work of the Spirit in others' life.
[3295.26 --> 3300.26]  And we are called to invite others in and to simply encourage them in their faith.
[3300.26 --> 3303.26]  We are called to recognize the work of the Spirit in the church,
[3303.26 --> 3308.26]  being glad about that work, not standing in its way, but encouraging it along.
[3308.26 --> 3314.26]  And we're called to recognize and offer grace to one another,
[3314.26 --> 3317.26]  just as Jesus has done for us.
[3317.26 --> 3324.26]  Brothers and sisters, let us all seek to live life in Christ,
[3324.26 --> 3328.26]  life full of faith and full of the Holy Spirit,
[3328.26 --> 3332.26]  so that maybe one day, too, when our time comes,
[3332.26 --> 3337.26]  words also might be spoken of us that were spoken of Barnabas.
[3337.26 --> 3342.26]  He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.
[3342.26 --> 3347.26]  She was a good woman, full of the Holy Spirit and faith.
[3347.26 --> 3348.26]  Amen.
[3349.26 --> 3351.26]  Let us pray.
[3355.26 --> 3361.26]  Father, we confess that so often we make ourselves the main characters of our own life,
[3361.26 --> 3364.26]  the main characters of the church, or the main characters of our faith.
[3364.26 --> 3370.26]  And yet we confess and we know, Jesus, that you are the main character of all.
[3370.26 --> 3373.26]  You are the one who saves us from our sin.
[3373.26 --> 3375.26]  You are the one who leads us in all things.
[3375.26 --> 3379.26]  And we thank you, God, that you are in control.
[3379.26 --> 3382.26]  Father, we thank you for people like Barnabas,
[3382.26 --> 3387.26]  examples of faith, reflections of your work here within this world.
[3387.26 --> 3391.26]  God, and we just ask that as we go out from this place in a couple of minutes,
[3391.26 --> 3394.26]  that you would continue to fill us with your faith,
[3394.26 --> 3398.26]  and that you would continue to fill us with the power of your Holy Spirit.
[3398.26 --> 3399.26]  Amen.
[3400.26 --> 3405.26]  Let us pray.
[3405.26 --> 3406.26]  Let us pray.
[3406.26 --> 3407.26]  Amen.
[3407.26 --> 3430.30]  Holy Spirit, living breath of God, breathe new life into my willing soul.
[3430.30 --> 3442.30]  Bring the presence of the risen Lord to renew my heart and make me whole.
[3443.30 --> 3455.30]  Cause your word to come alive in me. Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[3455.30 --> 3466.30]  Give me passion for your purity. Holy Spirit, bring new life into me.
[3466.30 --> 3484.30]  Holy Spirit, come up my breath in. May your joy be seen in all I do.
[3484.30 --> 3496.12]  Love enough to cover every sin in each thought and deed and attitude.
[3496.12 --> 3510.50]  Kindness to the greatest and the least. Gentleness that souls of half of peace.
[3510.50 --> 3521.74]  Turn my striving into words of grace. Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[3521.74 --> 3540.74]  Holy Spirit, from creation's birth, giving life to all that God has made.
[3540.74 --> 3553.74]  Show your power once again on earth. Cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[3553.74 --> 3566.74]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise. Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[3566.74 --> 3578.74]  That in unity the face of Christ may be clear for all the world to see.
[3578.74 --> 3591.74]  Let the fragrance of God.
[3591.74 --> 3596.74]  Let the fragrance of God be clear for all the things that I do.
[3596.74 --> 3600.74]  Let the fragrance of God be clear for all the things that I do.
[3600.74 --> 3605.74]  Let the fragrance of God be clear for all the things that I do.
[3605.74 --> 3610.74]  I am not surprised. I work with a script too and I have the yellow saying me right here.
[3610.74 --> 3616.74]  Good morning. The offering this morning is for an organization called One Book.
[3616.74 --> 3627.74]  One Book is a charitable organization based in Calgary that equips and empowers local men and women around the world to translate the scripture into the language of their people.
[3627.74 --> 3637.74]  It also teaches literacy which affects their ability to access health care, education, and improves economic development.
[3637.74 --> 3643.74]  It is recognized by our deacons as a worthy cause and we offer that to you this morning.
[3643.74 --> 3650.74]  And the deacons will come forward to collect that this morning.
[3650.74 --> 3652.74]  value of the фак苛 and elevate break up halfway of every day.
[3652.74 --> 3654.74]  In the aug Bitch channel we therefore have whatever it is that morning.
[3654.74 --> 3656.74]  In Heritage Hall is the day of the photo.
[3656.74 --> 3660.74]  The initial notice of spirit can fund the�를civity who are used at a time of lightspeedillar.
[3660.74 --> 3662.74]  If you will lift us to the maize and make it on meals a la是不是 of war.
[3662.74 --> 3663.74]  So thank you so much for all the gifts.
[3663.74 --> 3664.74]  People may also pay attention and pay attention to the spirits well as well as the to the theirrer to the lord.

[3710.74 --> 3712.74]  Amen.
[3740.74 --> 3742.74]  Amen.
[3770.74 --> 3772.74]  Amen.
[3785.34 --> 3789.68]  It's time for our congregational prayer.
[3790.82 --> 3792.20]  And we pray to God.
[3792.34 --> 3795.22]  Who is this God that we pray to?
[3796.54 --> 3799.26]  Well, we often say he's the God of heaven and earth.
[3799.26 --> 3801.36]  And that's a common phrase.
[3801.54 --> 3813.34]  And it's common enough for us to think that way because the heavens are up there, blue sky, and the earth is down here with green and rocks and trees as though they're roughly equivalent.
[3813.52 --> 3815.90]  But they're in no way equivalent.
[3816.14 --> 3817.66]  And God created them.
[3818.24 --> 3822.02]  I wasn't going to show this graphic this morning, but Jake liked it so much I will anyway.
[3822.02 --> 3829.90]  Anyway, that's a portion of the heavens as taken by the James Webb Space Telescope.
[3830.56 --> 3832.12]  Lots of dots up there.
[3833.70 --> 3834.64]  Lots of stars.
[3835.10 --> 3838.50]  But the reality is every one of those dots is not a star.
[3839.08 --> 3839.90]  It's a galaxy.
[3839.90 --> 3846.60]  And they estimate that each of those dots contains 100 billion stars.
[3848.44 --> 3853.08]  They estimate that there are more than 10,000 galaxies that we can see.
[3853.68 --> 3858.50]  And there are a bunch of galaxies moving away from us so fast that the light has not yet reached us.
[3859.64 --> 3861.22]  That's what God created.
[3861.22 --> 3875.92]  And here we are, one planet circling around, one sun in the Milky Way, which is one galaxy of those tens of thousands of galaxies.
[3876.06 --> 3877.68]  God created all those things.
[3878.64 --> 3880.04]  And he is everywhere there.
[3880.54 --> 3882.64]  And he is right here this morning.
[3882.64 --> 3893.36]  And he is willing and desirous to hear what we have to say, our petitions, our concerns, and our praise to him.
[3893.82 --> 3896.62]  It's that God that we come to this morning.
[3900.92 --> 3904.86]  Will you join me in a prayer?
[3907.12 --> 3909.08]  As soon as I find my prayer.
[3910.12 --> 3911.96]  Too many pieces of paper this morning.
[3912.64 --> 3922.42]  Let us pray to the God who created the heavens and the earth.
[3924.46 --> 3931.32]  Our Father, you are holy and righteous and just, deserving of praise, honor, and glory.
[3931.64 --> 3934.22]  Your name is great and greatly to be praised.
[3934.60 --> 3937.50]  Before the earth was formed, you were there.
[3937.50 --> 3941.74]  The heavens declare your glory.
[3941.88 --> 3946.12]  And we are still learning how great and wonderful these heavens truly are.
[3947.20 --> 3955.74]  Each atom and molecule, rock and tree, human and animal, planet and moon, star and galaxy,
[3956.38 --> 3960.46]  exist by your design, creation, and maintenance.
[3960.46 --> 3970.88]  Yet, by contrast to your all-inspiring greatness, we know we can call on you as a father, can directly approach you with our concerns.
[3971.64 --> 3975.68]  We can know that you are indeed right here with us close by this morning.
[3975.68 --> 3979.68]  We have reasons for thankfulness.
[3979.68 --> 3984.18]  What a beautiful time of the year to notice the wonder of your earth.
[3984.76 --> 3987.18]  We live in a glorious part of your creation.
[3987.18 --> 3995.96]  As a church, we've been blessed with the financial resources to continue your work in this group and in our local community.
[3997.96 --> 4008.98]  Indeed, in so many ways, we can be thankful for the peace and relative prosperity we enjoy that, in fact, many in the world don't have, especially in recent times.
[4008.98 --> 4012.98]  We have reasons for concern.
[4013.12 --> 4015.24]  We are thinking about those traveling on holidays.
[4015.44 --> 4016.58]  We ask that you keep them safe.
[4016.68 --> 4022.82]  We know in particular that Pastor Jason and the rest of his family are traveling.
[4023.92 --> 4029.34]  And we ask that they can enjoy, in safety, their travels in Vermont and Virginia.
[4029.60 --> 4034.32]  May it be a time of relaxation and recharging and renewed family connections for them.
[4034.32 --> 4041.34]  We do pray for those in our congregation for whom aging causes health issues to arise.
[4042.60 --> 4050.84]  We think of Pat Bauman, Shirley Rass, Eileen Rideout, Hank and Liz Van Beek, Tony Wanya.
[4051.76 --> 4057.80]  We pray for strength for those who have gained some years and acquired some health issues.
[4057.80 --> 4064.32]  We are concerned about those who are dealing with immediate health or life changes.
[4064.56 --> 4073.56]  Wilma Van Tal continues to have concerns about pains and difficulties, and the doctors are still trying to sort out the clarity for their problem.
[4073.86 --> 4076.22]  And we continue to pray for healing for her.
[4078.02 --> 4085.56]  We pray for Michael Wayne DeVos for his healing and for remission of the cancer.
[4085.56 --> 4088.96]  We offer him up in prayer to you.
[4090.52 --> 4094.78]  We continue to ask for healing for Sean Limas, the son of Andrew and Wilma Limas.
[4095.18 --> 4098.00]  He continues to suffer from Lyme disease and its effects.
[4100.60 --> 4102.04]  We pray for our world.
[4102.62 --> 4107.56]  We pray for our federal and provincial leaders as they are facing challenging times in the face of uncertainties
[4107.56 --> 4117.16]  uncertainties and threats made by American political leaders and the issues that promise to affect Canada and indeed many of the countries of the world.
[4119.24 --> 4122.26]  Give our leaders wisdom to face these challenges.
[4122.26 --> 4129.04]  And indeed, we ask that you empower Canadian leaders to be at the forefront in dealing with matters that affect not only our economies,
[4129.28 --> 4136.56]  but all those affected by food shortages, disease, and medical aid uncertainties.
[4137.90 --> 4143.08]  We pray for relief from the severe hot weather and heat dome affecting eastern Canada and the U.S.
[4143.08 --> 4149.46]  We know that elderly are especially challenged by unusual weather patterns and ask that this pass soon.
[4151.54 --> 4156.86]  There's conflict and unrest in the Middle East involving Israel, Gaza, Iran, and other countries.
[4157.60 --> 4159.56]  We pray for resolution of it.
[4159.56 --> 4189.54]  We pray for resolution of it.
[4189.56 --> 4194.46]  But who are nevertheless dying from violence, starvation, and disease.
[4194.92 --> 4196.96]  The numbers there are particularly staggering.
[4198.16 --> 4203.74]  So we ask for rapid resolution there and a return to a peaceful environment.
[4206.42 --> 4209.34]  As we conclude this prayer, we say,
[4209.50 --> 4210.40]  We will not be afraid.
[4210.72 --> 4213.12]  You, the Lord, will be with us wherever we go.
[4213.12 --> 4221.24]  We again return offering you praise and acknowledge your holy name, our Lord and God.
[4221.68 --> 4223.70]  In the name of Jesus, we pray these things.
[4224.26 --> 4224.58]  Amen.
[4229.08 --> 4230.40]  I think it's George's turn again.
[4230.40 --> 4237.10]  All right.
[4237.10 --> 4237.78]  Now it's my turn.
[4238.42 --> 4240.48]  Please stand with me to receive God's blessing.
[4244.54 --> 4249.30]  As we recognize at the beginning of the service that it is Jesus Christ who calls us here together,
[4249.40 --> 4253.66]  we also recognize at the end that it is Jesus Christ who also sends us out.
[4253.98 --> 4256.26]  And he sends us out with these words.
[4256.26 --> 4259.54]  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[4260.02 --> 4263.48]  May the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you.
[4263.88 --> 4268.48]  May the Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace.
[4269.02 --> 4269.94]  And let us all say,
[4270.78 --> 4270.96]  Amen.
[4270.96 --> 4289.08]  May the Lord bless your Holy name be after y's.
[4289.08 --> 4298.94]  We will extol you God and King and bless your holy name.
[4298.94 --> 4309.08]  Day after day we'll sing your praise, forever and forever.
[4310.18 --> 4314.80]  One generation will call to the next.
[4315.32 --> 4320.36]  Our God is good and his hand is strong.
[4320.36 --> 4332.82]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts, and a powerful voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4334.32 --> 4343.42]  Great is the Lord in all his ways, he's greatly to be praised.
[4343.42 --> 4354.48]  We're each in search for endless days, his greatness none could fathom.
[4355.02 --> 4359.58]  One generation will call to the next.
[4360.10 --> 4365.22]  Our God is good and his hand is strong.
[4365.22 --> 4378.06]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4378.06 --> 4393.52]  Now may your name be sung in every song, in every place.
[4393.52 --> 4403.52]  Singing the name of your great love in every generation.
[4403.52 --> 4409.38]  One generation will call to the next.
[4409.86 --> 4415.00]  Our God is good and his hand is strong.
[4415.56 --> 4427.60]  All of the world sings his marvelous acts, and our voice will join with theirs in the song.
[4433.52 --> 4450.08]  He'll sing the song every last.
[4450.08 --> 4450.68]  Hajde
[4450.68 --> 4451.80]  Now may your name be sung by the next.
[4451.80 --> 4452.18]  Here we will sing.
[4452.18 --> 4452.20]  Let's sing.
[4452.20 --> 4453.74]  The song every Э喝, and this is realised is what we唱 with every day.
[4453.74 --> 4454.74]  And this will be nicely to you.
[4454.74 --> 4455.38]  Let's sing.
[4455.38 --> 4455.82]  Here we come again.
[4455.82 --> 4457.36]  Now may your name be sung in the song.
[4457.36 --> 4458.62]  The song every song will be saved.
[4458.62 --> 4459.16]  He will be saved.
[4459.16 --> 4460.24]  Grazie to you.
[4460.24 --> 4461.16]  If you are ready before.
[4461.16 --> 4462.22]  Now may your name be added.
