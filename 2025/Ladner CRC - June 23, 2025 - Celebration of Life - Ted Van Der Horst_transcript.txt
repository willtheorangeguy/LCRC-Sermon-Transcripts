[499.90 --> 501.90]  You may be seated.
[506.90 --> 527.44]  On behalf of Joan and Linda, Harry and Clarence, I warmly welcome you to this memorial service for Ted Vanderhorst, who passed into glory on May 21st, 99 years old, just a few months shy of turning 100.
[527.44 --> 544.20]  And we have comfort knowing that Ted, who is a dear father, a dear grandfather, a dear great-grandfather, and a friend, was one who knew and trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[544.20 --> 558.28]  And so, though this afternoon we come with heavy hearts, with a deep sense of grief, because Ted is no longer with us, yet we rejoice in hope because of Jesus Christ who said,
[558.28 --> 569.36]  I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die. And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[569.36 --> 584.78]  And so, may God grant us true comfort in the gospel today, as we hold firmly to that promise that those who are in Christ will truly never die, because Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
[585.40 --> 590.14]  So let's come before the Lord this afternoon in prayer together. Please join me in prayer.
[590.14 --> 604.08]  Our great Heavenly Father, we do come to you this afternoon in tears and with heavy hearts, and yet we do not grieve as those without hope.
[604.58 --> 612.34]  We do not grieve as those without gratitude for the life that you have given Ted.
[612.98 --> 618.06]  Lord, we thank you for the life that you have given our dear brother in Christ, Ted Vanderhorst.
[618.06 --> 623.88]  And we're thankful, Lord, for the influence that he's had in each of our lives.
[624.56 --> 627.06]  He has been dear to each of us here.
[627.88 --> 630.48]  And Lord, we are thankful to you for him.
[631.68 --> 640.56]  And Lord, we're also thankful for the hope that we have, even in the face of death, because of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[640.56 --> 650.70]  For we know that Jesus is the resurrection and the life, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
[651.38 --> 658.04]  And so we pray, Lord, that those truths would comfort us this day.
[659.24 --> 665.88]  Oh, Lord, would you be with us this afternoon in this time of memory, of celebration.
[665.88 --> 673.28]  Comfort us, Lord, in our sorrow as we look to you and as we worship you.
[673.92 --> 675.86]  And we ask all of this in Christ's name.
[676.38 --> 676.68]  Amen.
[679.50 --> 691.76]  So we begin, I would like to begin with reading two passages that the family also suggested that tell us of the great hope that we have in the gospel.
[691.76 --> 698.10]  The first passage is from the book of Romans, Romans chapter 5, verses 1 through 5.
[699.10 --> 700.66]  This is the Apostle Paul.
[700.80 --> 701.54]  He writes this.
[702.80 --> 711.34]  Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[711.82 --> 717.52]  through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[717.52 --> 720.76]  And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
[721.50 --> 724.70]  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings.
[725.46 --> 728.74]  Because we know that suffering produces perseverance.
[730.30 --> 733.08]  Perseverance, character, and character, hope.
[733.50 --> 735.34]  And hope does not put us to shame.
[736.02 --> 742.66]  Because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
[742.66 --> 757.70]  And the second passage is Psalm 121, a familiar psalm, and a psalm that reminds us of the Lord's guidance and his presence with us throughout all of life.
[758.50 --> 760.14]  So Psalm 121 says this.
[760.14 --> 762.58]  I lift up my eyes to the mountains.
[763.06 --> 765.02]  Where does my help come from?
[765.78 --> 769.90]  My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[769.90 --> 772.24]  He will not let your foot slip.
[773.12 --> 775.08]  He who watches over you will not slumber.
[775.94 --> 780.70]  Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[781.54 --> 782.96]  The Lord watches over you.
[783.52 --> 785.60]  The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[786.44 --> 789.32]  The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
[790.04 --> 791.84]  The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[792.56 --> 794.18]  He will watch over your life.
[794.54 --> 799.40]  The Lord will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
[800.46 --> 800.76]  Amen.
[801.00 --> 803.98]  May God bless to us the reading of his word.
[804.70 --> 807.58]  And now we are going to sing two songs in a row.
[808.12 --> 810.30]  How Great Thou Art and When Peace Like a River.
[810.64 --> 811.70]  So I invite you to stand.
[812.54 --> 815.86]  And the words of the songs will be on the screens in front of you.
[815.86 --> 834.92]  O Lord, my God,
[834.92 --> 850.48]  O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder, consider all the works I am to pray.
[850.48 --> 867.54]  I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, I walk throughout the universe this way.
[867.54 --> 875.54]  And it sings my soul, my Savior, God to Thee.
[876.54 --> 883.54]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[884.76 --> 891.54]  And it sings my soul, my Savior, God to Thee.
[891.54 --> 901.54]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[903.54 --> 919.54]  And through the woods and forest days I wander, I hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
[919.54 --> 936.54]  And I look down from the mountain grand dew, and hear the roar, and feel the gentle breeze.
[936.54 --> 945.54]  And it sings my soul, my Savior, God to Thee.
[945.54 --> 953.54]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[954.54 --> 962.54]  And it sings my soul, my Savior, God to Thee.
[962.54 --> 972.54]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[972.54 --> 974.54]  What people dress like the song.
[974.54 --> 984.54]  What heaven and Perhaps we know is for the use of the Oh, the jail that the song we sung off are blue.
[984.54 --> 986.54]  to die
[986.54 --> 988.02]  by scarce
[988.02 --> 989.50]  and daily
[989.50 --> 994.54]  that on the cross
[995.06 --> 996.80]  I've heard
[996.80 --> 997.96]  in cloudy
[997.96 --> 999.66]  memory
[999.66 --> 1002.46]  he led and
[1002.46 --> 1003.74]  died
[1003.74 --> 1006.08]  to take away
[1006.08 --> 1007.74]  my sin
[1007.74 --> 1009.90]  and
[1009.90 --> 1012.38]  changed my soul
[1012.38 --> 1014.30]  my savior
[1014.30 --> 1016.30]  love to thee
[1017.42 --> 1020.30]  how great thou art
[1021.90 --> 1024.30]  how great thou art
[1026.10 --> 1028.30]  and saints my soul
[1029.76 --> 1031.66]  my savior
[1031.66 --> 1034.30]  love to thee
[1034.30 --> 1038.30]  how great thou art
[1038.82 --> 1042.30]  how great thou art
[1042.30 --> 1050.30]  and I shall come
[1050.30 --> 1052.30]  and I shall come
[1052.30 --> 1054.30]  and shout
[1054.30 --> 1054.78]  about the nation
[1054.78 --> 1058.30]  and take me home
[1058.30 --> 1060.30]  for joy
[1060.86 --> 1062.30]  shall fill my heart
[1062.30 --> 1064.30]  and I shall count
[1064.30 --> 1068.30]  and I shall come
[1068.30 --> 1070.30]  in my glory
[1070.30 --> 1072.30]  of the nation
[1072.30 --> 1076.30]  and ever remain
[1076.30 --> 1080.30]  and not the rain of God
[1080.30 --> 1110.28]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1110.30 --> 1118.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1140.30 --> 1150.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1150.30 --> 1156.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1156.30 --> 1160.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1160.30 --> 1168.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1168.30 --> 1170.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1170.30 --> 1180.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1180.30 --> 1190.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1190.30 --> 1200.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1200.30 --> 1210.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1210.30 --> 1214.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1214.30 --> 1222.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1222.30 --> 1226.30]  How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
[1226.30 --> 1241.30]  God bless the city and has shed his own blood for my soul.
[1241.30 --> 1262.30]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1262.30 --> 1276.48]  I sing out the bliss of his glorious love.
[1276.48 --> 1284.54]  I sing not in heart but the whole.
[1284.54 --> 1294.34]  It is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more.
[1294.76 --> 1303.54]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord for my soul.
[1303.54 --> 1313.02]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1313.02 --> 1325.02]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1325.02 --> 1340.18]  O Lord, it is the day when my faith shall be strong.
[1340.18 --> 1348.18]  The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[1348.18 --> 1358.18]  The john shall return and the Lord shall descend.
[1358.18 --> 1368.18]  Even so, it is well with my soul.
[1368.18 --> 1377.18]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1377.18 --> 1390.18]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1390.18 --> 1399.18]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1399.18 --> 1406.18]  It is well with my soul.
[1406.18 --> 1410.18]  I will ask you to hear some words of remembrance.
[1410.18 --> 1415.18]  Some stories about Ted and what he has meant to us and from some of the family.
[1415.18 --> 1418.18]  There are several family members.
[1418.18 --> 1421.18]  They will each come up and share in turn.
[1421.18 --> 1425.18]  After the sharing, there will be a slide show.
[1425.18 --> 1429.38]  So first, Terry and Joan.
[1441.38 --> 1447.98]  I don't know. I think so. First off, I want to just say thank you to each and
[1447.98 --> 1456.50]  every one of you for coming out here today just to help us with celebrating Dad's life.
[1457.26 --> 1465.86]  He meant a lot to many people here. We know that. And I see neighbors. I see church members.
[1465.86 --> 1471.36]  I see old family friends. And we're just so thankful that you could all be here.
[1471.36 --> 1481.98]  Thank you for coming. I also want to say I also want to welcome those family members in the Netherlands that are watching.
[1481.98 --> 1488.40]  They were going to stay up to be able to watch this service as well.
[1488.40 --> 1495.76]  So we are very glad to have them and also some of the family from Ontario also going to be here.
[1495.76 --> 1504.88]  So thank you. So these are just some combined memories that we have from Linda, Clarence, Harry and I.
[1504.88 --> 1514.04]  And I don't know how you sum up almost 100 years in just a few words. So bear with us.
[1514.04 --> 1525.28]  Dad was born in Nykerk in Gelderland into the Vanderhorst family of 11 children, him being number seven.
[1525.28 --> 1539.04]  His father was a laborer and dad spoke often of his father and how happy he was to be able to help him cut grass on the ditch banks with a scythe.
[1539.04 --> 1548.62]  Yeah, I do remember a scythe. His father didn't think he could do the work, but he proved him wrong.
[1548.62 --> 1560.62]  It was a rewarding time for them both. I think that experience did send back to the bicycle repair shop, which he was really good at fixing the bikes.
[1560.62 --> 1574.62]  His father was supportive of this as well. One day, dad came home with a sport bike with sport tires and chrome wheels.
[1574.62 --> 1584.62]  This was actually a no-no back in that day. His father took this all in and finally said, times do change and was accepting of it.
[1584.62 --> 1596.62]  Probably the low part of dad's life was when he, as an 18-year-old, he was picked up and put into a concentration camp, a work camp.
[1596.62 --> 1606.62]  From what we understand, he summed up his situation, which was not good, and decided he needed to break out of the camp.
[1606.62 --> 1616.62]  He and a friend made a run for it. Dad found freedom and went to a safe home in eastern Holland where he was looked after.
[1616.62 --> 1623.62]  His friend, on the other hand, was shot in front of him and died.
[1623.62 --> 1631.62]  Can't imagine the trauma. Dad suffered many years with these memories.
[1631.62 --> 1642.62]  Right till the end, when he told us the night before he went home to the Lord that he had a difficult night and he was dreaming about the war.
[1642.62 --> 1648.62]  We assured him that in heaven he will have peace forever.
[1648.62 --> 1656.62]  Later, when the liberators were moving toward Arnhem, his host family had to move out of their home for safety reasons.
[1656.62 --> 1662.62]  So they were invited to come to Nykerk and live with dad's family for a time.
[1662.62 --> 1669.62]  Actually, that family, their son and one of dad's sisters ended up marrying.
[1669.62 --> 1677.62]  And she's the one who used to come here every year to visit dad, Tantaria. We really loved her.
[1677.62 --> 1689.62]  Dad found the love of his life, my mom, our mom, Effie, in Barnevelt, a town about 15 kilometers away.
[1689.62 --> 1698.62]  This became a long-lasting relationship. I think he wore out quite a few tires on his bicycle going back and forth.
[1698.62 --> 1707.62]  Dad and mom were eventually engaged, only to have mom and her family immigrate to Ladner, B.C. in 1948.
[1707.62 --> 1713.62]  So dad did the best thing ever and immigrated three months later.
[1713.62 --> 1724.62]  He arrived in Ladner and was immediately put to work on River Road East, sandbagging as the river was very high.
[1724.62 --> 1728.62]  He later went to work for a farmer in Beach Grove.
[1728.62 --> 1736.62]  Now if you can picture my dad trying to work on a farm, that didn't go too well.
[1736.62 --> 1742.62]  To top it off, the farmer's wife was not easy to get along with.
[1742.62 --> 1749.62]  Dad left and went to work at the rice mill in Richmond, mostly a packaging business.
[1749.62 --> 1761.62]  From there, he found employment as a stockman receiver at the 4X Bakery, later known as Toastmaster McGavin's in Vancouver.
[1761.62 --> 1770.62]  In the early 70s, he did break from the bakery and worked for Lentel Construction.
[1770.62 --> 1774.62]  I don't know, there's probably some of you here that actually worked with my dad.
[1774.62 --> 1781.62]  He was an encourager, and I think you probably do remember him fondly.
[1781.62 --> 1788.62]  Dad did find that construction work was a bit too heavy, and he eventually found his way back to the bakery.
[1788.62 --> 1791.62]  He worked there until his retirement.
[1791.62 --> 1797.62]  Dad loved to garden, and always was successful with his harvest.
[1797.62 --> 1805.62]  One year, he decided to grow green beans and sell them to the local cannery on River Road West.
[1805.62 --> 1810.62]  After picking and bagging, he proudly took them to the cannery.
[1810.62 --> 1818.62]  The payment for these beans was so low, it ended up being a one-season affair.
[1818.62 --> 1829.62]  He was very disappointed, and the garden began to take on a different look with potatoes and buddhikol, which is kale in English.
[1829.62 --> 1836.62]  The garden was always planted on or around May 24.
[1836.62 --> 1845.62]  In the early 50s, Dad and Mom were able to purchase a house on Maypole Street, which is now 53rd Street.
[1845.62 --> 1851.62]  After completing on purchase, an inspector drove up and said the house was condemned.
[1851.62 --> 1854.62]  Well, Dad was floored.
[1854.62 --> 1856.62]  How could this be?
[1856.62 --> 1859.62]  He bought it from a policeman.
[1859.62 --> 1866.62]  The house had no bathroom, still only an outhouse.
[1866.62 --> 1878.62]  The city granted him a grace period, and Uncle Tony Schold, an experienced carpenter, went right to work and built an interior bathroom,
[1878.62 --> 1880.62]  after which the city was satisfied.
[1880.62 --> 1893.62]  He took great care of this home for many years.
[1893.62 --> 1898.62]  Dad raised and cared for his family very well, and he always had time for other things.
[1898.62 --> 1902.62]  He cut the lawn for Dr. Anderson and the Bullhuis family for many years.
[1902.62 --> 1908.62]  He was groundskeeper at the church here, and when Ladner Christian School was expanding,
[1908.62 --> 1913.62]  we and Dad would spend much time there in the building of additional rooms.
[1913.62 --> 1919.62]  He served on the finance committee for the school and would go around to collect the tuition and donations,
[1919.62 --> 1925.62]  and he was also a founding member of this church, and he served here as a deacon.
[1925.62 --> 1929.62]  Most of you who worship here know how he loved to sing.
[1929.62 --> 1938.62]  The later years were a little off-key, but at one time he did join the Praise the Lord choir of the church and was right on pitch.
[1938.62 --> 1940.62]  He stood next to me.
[1940.62 --> 1945.62]  Dad also loved skating.
[1945.62 --> 1950.62]  He would take a carload of kids Friday nights or Saturday afternoon to the wireless station,
[1950.62 --> 1955.62]  the hangar at the Boundary Bay Airport, which was converted into an ice rink.
[1955.62 --> 1958.62]  He loved to do figure eights on the ice.
[1958.62 --> 1963.62]  He also took Linda skating on the ice fields in Cloverdale when they lived there.
[1963.62 --> 1967.62]  Another thing he enjoyed was swimming.
[1967.62 --> 1975.62]  In 1966, Mom, Dad, Linda, and Joan and I, believe it or not, along with family, friends,
[1975.62 --> 1981.62]  the Mallinsteins traveled to Barrie, Ontario to visit Dad's brother, Albert, and family.
[1981.62 --> 1984.62]  We traveled in two cars, and that went well.
[1984.62 --> 1992.62]  But heading back from there, after a great visit, heading back, we decided to travel through the States on Highway 2.
[1992.62 --> 1999.62]  This went well until Dad's 1965 Ford meteor blew an engine in Poplar, Montana.
[1999.62 --> 2006.62]  After Mom, Linda, and Joan waited for hours in the laundromat, and as the town was infested with mosquitoes,
[2006.62 --> 2008.62]  they traveled home by train.
[2008.62 --> 2013.62]  The rest of us traveled home in Mallinstein's car.
[2013.62 --> 2019.62]  In their retirement years, Mom and Dad loved to spend time at Teepee, where they had a small trailer on an RV lot.
[2019.62 --> 2024.62]  They also enjoyed many trips back to the Netherlands to visit the siblings.
[2024.62 --> 2032.62]  Many of the siblings came to Canada to help celebrate special anniversaries, and even some weddings.
[2032.62 --> 2037.62]  When Mom and Dad lived on Grove Avenue, they would do many walks around the block.
[2037.62 --> 2041.62]  Dad continued doing this with his dog, Lacey, for many years.
[2041.62 --> 2045.62]  He also enjoyed stopping to talk to many people along the way.
[2045.62 --> 2052.62]  And in July of 2016, while on a walk, he put himself down on some grass as he wasn't feeling well.
[2052.62 --> 2057.62]  Two ladies out jogging spotted him, and thankfully called 911.
[2057.62 --> 2060.62]  It turned out he was having a heart attack.
[2060.62 --> 2069.62]  He was rushed to Vancouver General Hospital and had two stents installed, and then he recovered well from this.
[2069.62 --> 2075.62]  A few other memories shared by Linda were how Dad loved to tease everyone, sometimes a little bit off the cuff,
[2075.62 --> 2079.62]  but everyone who knew him knew he was joking and having fun.
[2079.62 --> 2085.62]  His love for playing the tile rummy and doing word search puzzles.
[2085.62 --> 2087.62]  He loved doing that.
[2087.62 --> 2094.62]  And his love for strawberry milkshakes, vanilla ice cream, chocolates.
[2094.62 --> 2098.62]  Be sure to take one of the little chocolates at the foyer table.
[2098.62 --> 2106.62]  Plain potato chips, which he kept by his chair while watching Wheel of Fortune, the news or a hockey game.
[2106.62 --> 2110.62]  And his love for fish and chips.
[2110.62 --> 2113.62]  Dad also took so much loving care of Mom.
[2113.62 --> 2114.62]  He loved her dearly.
[2114.62 --> 2118.62]  He would shake his head when she says some of her silly things.
[2118.62 --> 2122.62]  Something we all remember and cherish is when we visited Dad at Evergreen,
[2122.62 --> 2126.62]  we would never leave without him saying, I love you guys.
[2126.62 --> 2133.62]  He would usually get a bit emotional, but also give a warm hug and a big beautiful smile.
[2133.62 --> 2140.62]  We again thank you for being here and we especially want to thank those who visited Dad at his home and at Evergreen.
[2140.62 --> 2144.62]  He so loved and appreciated the time taken to visit him.
[2144.62 --> 2148.62]  Thank you to the staff of the Wisteria community.
[2148.62 --> 2153.62]  Your love, kindness and incredible care is greatly appreciated.
[2153.62 --> 2160.62]  He so loved Ladner, his neighbors and his church and missed everyone here.
[2160.62 --> 2163.62]  But he would say, you don't have to worry about me.
[2163.62 --> 2165.62]  They take good care of me here.
[2165.62 --> 2167.62]  I have nothing to complain about.
[2167.62 --> 2169.62]  I have friends here.
[2169.62 --> 2177.62]  Dad was a special man, loving husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather to us all.
[2177.62 --> 2182.62]  We always love him, remember him and cherish our memories with him.
[2182.62 --> 2186.62]  We were blessed to share in his 99 plus years.
[2186.62 --> 2190.62]  Question one of the Heidelberg Catechism asks,
[2190.62 --> 2193.62]  What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[2193.62 --> 2203.62]  That I am not my own, but belong of body and soul, in life and in death, to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2203.62 --> 2208.62]  He fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has set me free.
[2208.62 --> 2213.62]  We give thanks that Dad is now with his Lord and Savior.
[2213.62 --> 2238.62]  Good afternoon.
[2238.62 --> 2240.62]  Papa, Opa, Grandpa.
[2240.62 --> 2245.62]  That is who I will be sharing a collection of memories and stories about over the next few minutes.
[2245.62 --> 2248.62]  These are from his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren.
[2248.62 --> 2251.62]  So we tried to combine them as much as we could.
[2251.62 --> 2257.62]  To me he was Grandpa, so that is how I will refer to him in this.
[2257.62 --> 2270.62]  We all remember Grandpa as a fun man, a funny man with his teasing, a loving man and a God-loving man.
[2270.62 --> 2272.62]  He loved people.
[2272.62 --> 2277.62]  He loved to be around people and to just watch them from his recliner in his living room.
[2277.62 --> 2280.62]  But he really loved his grandkids and great-grandkids.
[2280.62 --> 2282.62]  Do you know how we knew that?
[2282.62 --> 2283.62]  Teasing.
[2283.62 --> 2286.62]  Boy, did he love to tease.
[2286.62 --> 2288.62]  It was his kind of love language.
[2288.62 --> 2290.62]  If he loved you, he teased you.
[2290.62 --> 2292.62]  And he really loved to tease all of us.
[2292.62 --> 2293.62]  He would ask,
[2293.62 --> 2295.62]  Why did you come to visit me?
[2295.62 --> 2296.62]  You don't even like me.
[2296.62 --> 2300.62]  I would usually respond with, because my mom made me.
[2300.62 --> 2304.62]  Another one that he liked to tell us was,
[2304.62 --> 2306.62]  I love you, but just a little bit.
[2306.62 --> 2309.62]  Or, don't go away mad, just go away.
[2309.62 --> 2314.62]  We always knew that he was joking, because he would have a big smile,
[2314.62 --> 2320.62]  and sometimes he would laugh while clapping his hands and raising one leg with a stomp on the floor.
[2320.62 --> 2326.62]  Stupid or goofy were descriptive words that he used a lot.
[2326.62 --> 2331.62]  They were used in the same way, whether it was describing something he was amazed by,
[2331.62 --> 2337.62]  or a person that was funny, or a person that he didn't like, or a person that he did like,
[2337.62 --> 2340.62]  or a person he thought was really smart.
[2340.62 --> 2343.62]  To Grandpa, they were all stupid or goofy.
[2343.62 --> 2349.62]  You could usually figure out which one he meant by his tone or his expression.
[2349.62 --> 2354.62]  Like when Axel visited him in the care facility in his suit on the way to prom,
[2354.62 --> 2356.62]  he said with a laugh,
[2356.62 --> 2358.62]  Oh, look at this stupid guy.
[2358.62 --> 2361.62]  But followed it up by saying how good he looked.
[2361.62 --> 2374.62]  Out of all the memories that we have, I can say a common theme was remembering how much Grandpa loved to play Rummy-O or Tile Rummy.
[2374.62 --> 2377.62]  And everyone always had a similar experience.
[2377.62 --> 2379.62]  All of us grandkids had a similar memory on this.
[2379.62 --> 2386.62]  Grandpa would usually win, but somehow he always had the most wild card tiles,
[2386.62 --> 2391.62]  or he happened to find a tile on his lap after we were finished playing.
[2391.62 --> 2396.62]  And it was usually one of those bad cart tiles that you wouldn't be able to get rid of.
[2396.62 --> 2399.62]  He found a way to get rid of it.
[2399.62 --> 2402.62]  Grandpa liked to pretend that he was cheap.
[2402.62 --> 2407.62]  He and Grandma played the good cop, bad cop routine when it came to being generous to us all.
[2407.62 --> 2410.62]  Grandma loved to give. This was her love language.
[2410.62 --> 2414.62]  Grandpa would always include his love language by saying things like,
[2414.62 --> 2419.62]  I don't want to give this. Now I don't have any money left. Or that's just from Grandma.
[2419.62 --> 2423.62]  Grandpa's cheap routine wasn't just about money or gifts.
[2423.62 --> 2428.62]  When Grandma would load our toast with butter and white sugar or chocolate sprinkles,
[2428.62 --> 2432.62]  Grandpa would complain that he couldn't afford it and we needed to dump some off.
[2434.62 --> 2437.62]  Grandma would tell him to stop, and he would.
[2437.62 --> 2443.62]  But you know what? After Grandma passed, he made sure that he always gave a gift or some money.
[2443.62 --> 2448.62]  Usually $100 to $150, which was pretty good for a guy in a pension.
[2448.62 --> 2450.62]  And for our birthdays and Christmas.
[2450.62 --> 2455.62]  I think he knew how important that was to Grandma, and he wanted to honor her in that way.
[2455.62 --> 2461.62]  He also loved to take us all out for dinner as family when we were together for special family events.
[2461.62 --> 2463.62]  And he always insisted on paying.
[2463.62 --> 2467.62]  So in reality, we always knew the cheap routine was just for show.
[2467.62 --> 2474.62]  He loved to garden. We all remember his vegetable gardens and his flowers.
[2474.62 --> 2479.62]  Growing his beans and potatoes was something he loved to do until his final few years.
[2479.62 --> 2483.62]  His love for gardening was known at the care facility that he was at.
[2483.62 --> 2487.62]  There was a courtyard with some garden and some planters.
[2487.62 --> 2490.62]  He didn't use gloves while gardening.
[2490.62 --> 2494.62]  I think this caught a few of the staff by surprise with his dirty hands.
[2494.62 --> 2500.62]  He would tell the staff that he didn't need gloves, tease some of them about their lack of gardening skills.
[2500.62 --> 2505.62]  Grandpa wasn't afraid of hard work, and he was always willing to lend a hand.
[2505.62 --> 2514.62]  When Julianne and I moved into our first rental house back in 1997, he would come and help with the gardens and prune the apple trees.
[2514.62 --> 2521.62]  Any time that he visited Nicky and Santa's house, he would start picking weeds in the vegetable garden and help out.
[2521.62 --> 2528.62]  And when Julianne and I bought our house 13 years ago, we came home one day and found him in the backyard,
[2528.62 --> 2534.62]  breaking up a concrete slab with a sledgehammer where he knew we wanted a new garden.
[2534.62 --> 2537.62]  He was 86 at the time.
[2537.62 --> 2542.62]  His work hard mentality also got him into some trouble from time to time.
[2542.62 --> 2548.62]  One Saturday morning, we were all out for breakfast before my parents were heading out on a cruise to Alaska in the afternoon.
[2548.62 --> 2555.62]  Santos and I had discussed with him about going to his house later in the day to clean the needles off his roof and clean the gutters.
[2555.62 --> 2558.62]  Well, he couldn't wait those extra few hours.
[2558.62 --> 2561.62]  And we found this out because a neighbor called me.
[2561.62 --> 2570.62]  They heard a loud crash two houses over, ran over to the house, and saw that Grandpa had fallen off his ladder, bounced off the patio table, and landed on the ground.
[2570.62 --> 2572.62]  They had to call 911.
[2572.62 --> 2578.62]  When I went to see him at emergency, he didn't want my parents to find out and told us not to tell them.
[2578.62 --> 2581.62]  We didn't until they came home from their trip.
[2581.62 --> 2584.62]  His ladder was promptly removed from his property.
[2584.62 --> 2590.62]  This may have stopped him from going on ladders, but he wasn't going to be stopped from gardening,
[2590.62 --> 2596.62]  even if it meant taking his phone out to the front yard with him in case he felt like he was going to pass out.
[2596.62 --> 2600.62]  Sometimes he would just lay himself on the lawn until he felt better.
[2600.62 --> 2611.62]  The other thing we would have to beat into him was shoveling snow off his, or beat him to, was shoveling snow off his long driveway.
[2611.62 --> 2616.62]  His neighbors also learned to try and beat him to it if we couldn't get there on time.
[2616.62 --> 2621.62]  His work ethic was a blessing when it came to caring for Grandma after a stroke.
[2621.62 --> 2623.62]  He loved her so much.
[2623.62 --> 2629.62]  Grandpa wasn't a big man, and Grandma wasn't a small lady, but he never complained about caring for her.
[2629.62 --> 2632.62]  He would wheel her wherever she needed to go.
[2632.62 --> 2635.62]  He would get her in and out of their car without any trouble.
[2635.62 --> 2638.62]  Well, he wouldn't let anyone know if it was trouble.
[2638.62 --> 2646.62]  Although, one Thanksgiving as they were heading to my parents with the turkey, Grandpa got Grandma into the car, got her wheelchair into the trunk.
[2646.62 --> 2649.62]  Although, he did forget to put the turkey in the trunk.
[2649.62 --> 2655.62]  And when he put the car in reverse, he rolled over the roasting pan, crushing it along with the turkey.
[2655.62 --> 2659.62]  I don't think any of us ever let him forget that one.
[2659.62 --> 2666.62]  Grandma always said, I hope that he dies before me, because I don't think he can last long without me.
[2666.62 --> 2677.62]  Looking back at it, I think she knew the struggle he had with the PTSD undiagnosed of being in the work camp and having the friends killed while escaping.
[2677.62 --> 2684.62]  We never fully understood how Grandma supported him, as this wasn't really discussed until the last decade or so of his life.
[2684.62 --> 2688.62]  But, you know, Grandpa surprised us all though, right?
[2688.62 --> 2691.62]  Because Grandma passed away in 2010, and he kept going.
[2691.62 --> 2697.62]  Both Grandpa and Grandma were welcoming and loving to new family members or partners of their grandchildren.
[2697.62 --> 2703.62]  Grandpa was always good at welcoming them with some good ribbing, but usually it would turn into teasing his grandkids instead.
[2703.62 --> 2708.62]  He'd say things like, what do you see in him? Or, you're a lucky boy.
[2708.62 --> 2713.62]  If you couldn't tease him back, or if you could tease him back, I think he liked you even more.
[2713.62 --> 2718.62]  Grandpa was loving, kind, caring, and faithful.
[2718.62 --> 2725.62]  He was a grandpa who left a legacy by leading in a way that really reflected the leadership style that Jesus called us to be.
[2725.62 --> 2732.62]  Leading in humility and love. Surrounded by loved ones at the end, he showed us what a life full of the love of Jesus looked like.
[2732.62 --> 2749.62]  Grandpa, we love you, but we don't know why.
[2749.62 --> 2755.62]  Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here to celebrate the life of Ted Vanderhorst.
[2755.62 --> 2762.62]  He was truly a remarkable man who lived not just 99 years, but 99 full, meaningful, and unforgettable years.
[2762.62 --> 2769.62]  Most importantly, Ted didn't just reach 99. He charged right through it, in his wooden clogs and all.
[2769.62 --> 2778.62]  I first met Ted when he was 64. From that day on, for the next 36 years, I had the privilege of calling him Papa.
[2778.62 --> 2785.62]  And like any good grandpa, it didn't take long for us to discover his competitiveness.
[2785.62 --> 2789.62]  Especially when it came to card games, board games, or darts.
[2789.62 --> 2796.62]  He lived long enough to witness more change than many of us could imagine in four lifetimes.
[2796.62 --> 2803.62]  He lived through world wars, black and white TVs, cassette tapes, color televisions, rotary phones,
[2803.62 --> 2808.62]  the rise of rock and roll, disco, and the internets.
[2808.62 --> 2814.62]  And through it all, one thing never changed with Ted. His sharp wit and his cheeky sense of humor.
[2814.62 --> 2822.62]  Ted outlived most of his peers, several major inventions, and at least three versions of the Canadian Food Guide.
[2822.62 --> 2827.62]  Including one that insisted on six servings of bread a day.
[2827.62 --> 2833.62]  And I think we all know Ted was fully on board with that, as long as the bread was from Gavin's.
[2833.62 --> 2839.62]  But more than fresh bread, more than games, Ted loved his wife and his family.
[2839.62 --> 2845.62]  That love was steady, strong, unwavering, like a sturdy Dutch windmill.
[2845.62 --> 2850.62]  He showed up for his family again and again, no matter the reason.
[2850.62 --> 2856.62]  I'll never forget him sitting in the same seat, wearing the same familiar grin every grandparents' day at school.
[2856.62 --> 2860.62]  Rain or shine, he was there, just as he always was.
[2860.62 --> 2864.62]  So today, let's not just say goodbye. Let's laugh. Let's tell his stories.
[2864.62 --> 2869.62]  Let's remember that Ted didn't just live a long life. He was a very full one.
[2869.62 --> 2875.62]  Papa, you lived 99 years your way. And we're all the better for having had you in our lives.
[2875.62 --> 2880.62]  Rest easy in heaven now. Hopefully you have a slice of toast with some hoggle slog.
[2880.62 --> 2886.62]  Milk chocolate, of course. And someone brave enough to challenge you at Romeo.
[2886.62 --> 2904.62]  You guys are in for a treat. Hello everyone. Thanks for being here.
[2904.62 --> 2913.62]  To all of my family was Opa, Papa, Dad. But to me, he was Pop. He was my Pop.
[2913.62 --> 2918.62]  And he was the best Pop ever. I met him in, the first time I met him was in 2000.
[2918.62 --> 2923.62]  That's when I first came to Canada. And the first thing I learned about my Pop,
[2923.62 --> 2931.62]  you cannot be thin-skinned when you're around him, or easy to be offended,
[2931.62 --> 2934.62]  because, man, you stand no chance around him.
[2934.62 --> 2942.62]  He would say, why don't you go have a shower, wipe that dirt, wash that dirt off your skin.
[2942.62 --> 2947.62]  And I go, from that day, we begin to click. But it's been amazing.
[2947.62 --> 2952.62]  It's been an amazing journey to know Pop. He was amazing.
[2952.62 --> 2956.62]  And I was honored to serve him. And I know as I get to know him more,
[2956.62 --> 2959.62]  and even down the years, we get to spend a lot of time together.
[2959.62 --> 2965.62]  And one of the, there's two things that define who Ted van der Hoers was.
[2965.62 --> 2972.62]  Was his deep faith. His love for Jesus never wavers.
[2972.62 --> 2978.62]  And another thing that was very important to him was his deep sense of family.
[2978.62 --> 2982.62]  Wow. It meant so much to him.
[2982.62 --> 2986.62]  Oh, that was the core of Ted van der Hoers.
[2986.62 --> 2989.62]  And over the years, I get to spend time with Ted.
[2989.62 --> 2992.62]  You get to journey with him, walk with him.
[2992.62 --> 2997.62]  You know, spend time praying with him, have coffee together, have breakfast together.
[2997.62 --> 3000.62]  Oh, man. And then I know the mention about being guardian.
[3000.62 --> 3006.62]  This is what my Pop used to wear in the early years when he used to come to my house before even,
[3006.62 --> 3009.62]  when he used to come to my house.
[3009.62 --> 3014.62]  If it's not for dinner or for birthday parties, this is what he used to wear.
[3014.62 --> 3017.62]  Greg mentioned it before in the garden.
[3017.62 --> 3021.62]  He would just come home and into my house and he would just do the garden.
[3021.62 --> 3025.62]  Don't even ask to ask him, but he would just love him.
[3025.62 --> 3027.62]  Oh, man. I love that guy so much.
[3027.62 --> 3035.62]  And even I know even as the years goes by, I had the opportunity to go with him and get him ready for bed.
[3035.62 --> 3042.62]  I'm just praying with him and just a sense of connection and just a deep sense of gratitude and his love for Jesus.
[3042.62 --> 3045.62]  Man, it means so much to me. It means so much to me.
[3045.62 --> 3048.62]  And some of the funny things that I can remember of my Pop,
[3048.62 --> 3052.62]  and you know, you go there and you spend like an hour, an hour and a half, and you say,
[3052.62 --> 3056.62]  Bye, Pop. And he would say, I thought you will never leave.
[3056.62 --> 3062.62]  Or he would say, come back when you can't stay so long.
[3062.62 --> 3064.62]  Right?
[3064.62 --> 3067.62]  And it was so awesome to be with him.
[3067.62 --> 3072.62]  And so for the last and the final time, Pop, I thought you would never leave.
[3072.62 --> 3078.62]  I can only imagine it will be the light when I walk by your side.
[3078.62 --> 3084.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3084.62 --> 3086.62]  When the face is performing.
[3086.62 --> 3090.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3090.62 --> 3092.62]  When the face is performing.
[3092.62 --> 3096.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3096.62 --> 3098.62]  When the face is performing.
[3098.62 --> 3100.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3100.62 --> 3102.62]  When the face is performing.
[3102.62 --> 3112.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3112.62 --> 3114.62]  When the face is performing.
[3114.62 --> 3116.62]  I can only imagine.
[3116.62 --> 3117.62]  You...
[3117.62 --> 3134.62]  I can only imagine what my eyes will see.
[3134.62 --> 3164.60]  Thank you.

[3772.60 --> 3802.60] 
[3802.60 --> 3804.60]  Thank you.
[3804.60 --> 3806.60]  Thank you.
[3806.60 --> 3808.60]  Thank you.

[3870.60 --> 3872.60]  Thank you.
[3872.60 --> 3874.60]  Thank you.
[3874.60 --> 3876.60]  Thank you.
[3876.60 --> 3878.60]  Thank you.
[3878.60 --> 3880.60]  Thank you.
[3880.60 --> 3882.60]  Thank you.
[3882.60 --> 3884.60]  Thank you.
[3884.60 --> 3886.60]  Thank you.
[3886.60 --> 3888.60]  Thank you.
[3888.60 --> 3890.60]  Thank you.
[3890.60 --> 3892.60]  Thank you.
[3892.60 --> 3894.60]  Thank you.
[3894.60 --> 3900.46]  confidence of the Apostle Paul in the same confidence that Ted had right into the end.
[3901.20 --> 3905.52]  Now, yeah, you know, there can be some apprehension about death, even for believers.
[3907.00 --> 3912.70]  And so why do we have that natural fear of death? Well, for one, I think fear comes from not really
[3912.70 --> 3917.98]  knowing what it will be like to die. None of us has ever died and lived to tell about it.
[3918.74 --> 3923.34]  So there's a sense of mystery about death, you know, and so there could be some apprehension.
[3924.60 --> 3931.68]  But our fear of death also comes from our awareness, doesn't it, that we actually deserve
[3931.68 --> 3941.10]  punishment for our sins against God. You see, in order for us to stand before God without any fear,
[3941.52 --> 3947.64]  we must be confident that all of our sins have been paid for, that we don't stand before God,
[3947.64 --> 3956.16]  the holy judge in our own sins, but we stand before him forgiven, right? And forgiven not only for those
[3956.16 --> 3963.26]  big sins that we have in our lives, but even for those little ones, the unkind thoughts and maybe
[3963.26 --> 3971.68]  that desire to seek vengeance in some way, or those little deeds and little words that we say,
[3971.68 --> 3980.40]  that we've spoken. Every one of those things must be paid for. But listen to what the, what God says,
[3980.70 --> 3984.70]  the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 9, verses 27 and 28.
[3984.70 --> 3995.12]  Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once
[3995.12 --> 4002.10]  to take away the sins of many. And he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation
[4002.10 --> 4011.46]  to those who are waiting for him. You see, friends, Jesus died as a sacrifice in our place to take away
[4011.46 --> 4020.56]  our sins to bring us salvation, right? So that we can then turn to Jesus as our Savior and confess our
[4020.56 --> 4028.92]  sins, seek his forgiveness. And when we do that, we will stand before that judgment day that each one
[4028.92 --> 4037.36]  of us will face, not in fear, but in joy, in confidence, because Christ has died for me.
[4037.36 --> 4047.34]  And that is what Jesus has done for us. And because Jesus died for us, you can live this life and you
[4047.34 --> 4057.80]  can die without any fear. You can live a life of joy, like Ted so, you know, showed us. A life of confidence,
[4058.14 --> 4064.04]  a life of love. And you can face eternity with confidence, not, you know, because of your own record
[4064.04 --> 4072.22]  of having a pretty good moral life, but because of the perfect record of Jesus Christ. And that's why
[4072.22 --> 4082.00]  Paul says what he does in verse 8 in 2 Timothy. Paul says this, now there is in store for me the crown
[4082.00 --> 4088.20]  of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day. And not only to me,
[4088.20 --> 4101.66]  but also to all who have longed for his appearing. And so what happened on May 21st, 2025, the very moment
[4101.66 --> 4110.02]  that Ted died and stood before his Lord was that Ted received in that moment the crown of righteousness.
[4110.02 --> 4118.94]  And you notice that it's, it's a crown that is given, is given to him by the Lord, the righteous judge who
[4118.94 --> 4127.40]  gives it to him on that day. And so you realize in the end, it's only God's judgment that really matters,
[4127.40 --> 4134.38]  right? It's only what Christ thinks of us in the end that makes any difference in eternity.
[4134.38 --> 4141.94]  You know, there's a story I heard about Babe Ruth. You know, he was one of the greatest baseball hitters
[4141.94 --> 4150.04]  of all time. And during one game when he was at bat, he swung and the empire said, strike.
[4151.72 --> 4158.28]  And then he swung again and the empire said, strike again. And he swung a third time and the emperor said,
[4158.72 --> 4164.36]  strike a third time. And Babe Ruth turned to the empire and said, that wasn't a strike.
[4164.38 --> 4172.80]  That was a ball. And there are 40,000 fans who have the same opinion as me. And the empire turned
[4172.80 --> 4179.60]  to Babe Ruth and said, there could very well be 40,000 here who disagree with my call, but my judgment
[4179.60 --> 4189.60]  is the only one that matters in this case. And that will be true as we stand, each one of us,
[4189.60 --> 4197.52]  before the Lord Jesus Christ. Right? Only his judgment matters in the end.
[4198.44 --> 4206.82]  And many people may speak well of us in this life. And many of us can speak so well of Ted.
[4207.66 --> 4213.84]  And we praise God for that. But in the end, whether people speak well of us or poorly of us,
[4213.84 --> 4219.96]  the only judgment that matters is the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ. That's what makes any
[4219.96 --> 4229.94]  difference at all. And so we've considered these last words of the Apostle Paul in this letter to
[4229.94 --> 4237.86]  Timothy and how they've applied to our brother Ted. But as we close, I want to consider for a moment
[4237.86 --> 4246.18]  someone else's last words. And those are the last words of our Lord Jesus. When Jesus was on the cross,
[4246.28 --> 4252.72]  when he was suffering and dying for the sins of all of his people, Ted and each one of us who put our
[4252.72 --> 4260.94]  faith in him, Jesus's last words on the cross were, it is finished. And that means that everything that
[4260.94 --> 4268.48]  was necessary for the salvation of any one of us has been completed. Right? So that whoever believes
[4268.48 --> 4275.52]  in him will not perish but have everlasting life. Right? And so friends, Jesus is the one who finished
[4275.52 --> 4284.52]  the race on our behalf. Right? He won the victory. And therefore, we don't have to finish the race and
[4284.52 --> 4294.78]  say, I've won. We don't have to fight the battle on our own. But we simply follow in the footsteps of
[4294.78 --> 4305.74]  our Lord Jesus. And we receive the crown of righteousness from him. So I love to think of Ted
[4305.74 --> 4314.50]  standing in God's presence before that judge and hearing the words, well done, good and faithful
[4314.50 --> 4323.52]  servant. Because he lived a life of faith to the end, not in his own power, but by the grace of his
[4323.52 --> 4326.20]  Lord Jesus Christ. So let's pray together.
[4330.00 --> 4337.92]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for these words in 2 Timothy that you have given to us. Thank you that you've
[4337.92 --> 4344.44]  given us hope in the midst of our sorrow. That you've given us victory in the face of that great enemy
[4344.44 --> 4350.18]  the enemy, the enemy of death. And you have promised that this enemy, that you have broken his power,
[4350.70 --> 4353.46]  that you have removed its sting, that you have defeated it.
[4354.88 --> 4358.74]  Father, we thank you for the life of our dear brother in Christ, Ted Vanderhorst.
[4359.46 --> 4363.96]  We thank you, Lord, for his faith in you that was sustained by your grace.
[4364.58 --> 4367.32]  We thank you that by your grace he could finish well,
[4367.32 --> 4371.68]  testifying even to his last days of his hope in you.
[4373.50 --> 4378.34]  Lord, as we reflect on our own lives, may that be an encouragement to us.
[4379.16 --> 4383.78]  May we too consider what we are living for and set our sights on the crown of righteousness
[4383.78 --> 4387.68]  that Christ has promised to all of his people.
[4387.68 --> 4395.06]  We thank you, Lord, for the great invitation that all who come to you by faith you will by no means cast out,
[4395.50 --> 4397.10]  but that we can have life in your name.
[4397.66 --> 4399.90]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4402.88 --> 4405.96]  So I invite you to stand, embody your own spirit as you are able,
[4406.16 --> 4407.66]  and we'll sing another song together,
[4408.42 --> 4409.44]  Nearer, Still Nearer.
[4409.44 --> 4410.44]  Amen.
[4410.44 --> 4411.44]  Amen.
[4439.44 --> 4440.44]  Amen.

[4467.26 --> 4468.26]  Amen.
[4468.26 --> 4469.42]  Amen.
[4469.42 --> 4477.74]  All feet of glory close to thy rest.
[4478.60 --> 4488.16]  Shelter we say in thy name and our rest.
[4488.16 --> 4498.42]  Shelter we say in thy name and our rest.
[4499.42 --> 4511.16]  Nearer, still nearer, loving I bring.
[4511.16 --> 4521.16]  God has had offering to Jesus my name.
[4521.16 --> 4531.90]  Holy, my simple, thou art my God.
[4531.90 --> 4542.90]  Grant me a cleansing thy love, loving heart.
[4542.90 --> 4553.90]  Grant me a cleansing thy love, loving heart.
[4553.90 --> 4568.08]  Nearer, still nearer, my life shall last.
[4568.08 --> 4578.08]  Till safe in glory thy anger is found.
[4578.08 --> 4589.08]  True, endless angels, ever to thee.
[4589.82 --> 4599.08]  Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to thee.
[4599.08 --> 4610.82]  Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to thee.
[4610.82 --> 4611.82]  Amen.
[4611.82 --> 4612.82]  Amen.
[4612.82 --> 4622.70]  Please join me in prayer.
[4622.70 --> 4640.58]  Lord, eternal God and Father, your word testifies that gathered around your throne and in glory, there is a great company of those who have kept the faith and who have finished their race and who now rest from their labors.
[4640.58 --> 4649.40]  We thank you, Lord, for giving Ted to us as a father, a grandfather, a great grandfather, and as a friend and brother in Christ.
[4649.82 --> 4657.84]  We thank you that we can know him and love him as a companion on this earthly pilgrimage.
[4657.84 --> 4663.34]  And now, in your boundless compassion, we pray that you would console us who mourn.
[4663.34 --> 4679.14]  Would you give us faith to see and death the gateway to eternal life, so that in quiet confidence we may continue our course on earth until, by your call, we too are brought into your glorious presence in the fullness of joy.
[4679.14 --> 4690.08]  And, Lord, we thank you for Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, our Savior and our Redeemer, the risen Christ who rose from the grave in victory.
[4690.68 --> 4694.84]  We thank you that Ted is even now experiencing that great victory.
[4695.64 --> 4703.38]  And until the day when we are united with him and with all the saints who have gone before us, Lord, comfort us by your spirit.
[4703.96 --> 4708.00]  Watch over our coming and going, both now and forevermore.
[4708.00 --> 4710.60]  We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4714.10 --> 4718.10]  So we go out with God's good word upon us, his benediction.
[4718.82 --> 4722.44]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving that blessing.
[4723.36 --> 4731.24]  Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling, to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy,
[4731.24 --> 4737.72]  to the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[4738.00 --> 4742.02]  Before all ages, now and forevermore. Amen.
[4743.10 --> 4744.44]  So you may be seated.
[4745.76 --> 4750.84]  And thank you again for being here with us today.
[4750.84 --> 4756.84]  And there will be a reception immediately following through the doors there into our fellowship hall.
[4758.02 --> 4768.92]  And so I'm going to ask our Joe and Bill to help us dismiss our guests row by row.
[4769.04 --> 4769.98]  So we'll be getting with the family.
[4769.98 --> 4772.56]  So please remain seated until you are dismissed.
[4773.02 --> 4773.74]  Thank you.
[4780.16 --> 4781.54]  There's one more song.
[4784.48 --> 4784.96]  Okay.
[4785.08 --> 4786.48]  So let's sing.
[4786.62 --> 4787.14]  It's short.
[4787.14 --> 4788.52]  Amen.
[4801.18 --> 4801.74]  Amen.
[4801.74 --> 4813.66]  Yeah.
[4813.66 --> 4821.74]  Praise in the love we will be most.
