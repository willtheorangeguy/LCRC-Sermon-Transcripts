[8.86 → 15.86] In my temple...
[16.92 → 19.66] In prayer, blessed No brown
[19.66 → 24.88] I've aged some great gifts
[24.88 → 26.88] Amen.
[54.88 → 56.88] Amen.
[84.88 → 86.88] Amen.
[114.88 → 116.88] Amen.
[144.88 → 146.88] Amen.
[174.88 → 176.88] Amen.
[204.88 → 206.88] Amen.
[234.88 → 236.88] Amen.
[264.88 → 266.88] Amen.
[294.88 → 296.88] Amen.
[324.88 → 326.88] Amen.
[354.88 → 356.88] Amen.
[384.88 → 386.88] Amen.
[414.88 → 416.88] Amen.
[444.88 → 446.88] Amen.
[474.88 → 476.88] Amen.
[476.88 → 478.88] Amen.
[478.88 → 480.88] Amen.
[480.88 → 482.88] Amen.
[482.88 → 484.88] Amen.
[484.88 → 486.88] Amen.
[486.88 → 488.88] Amen.
[488.88 → 492.88] Well, good morning.
[492.88 → 496.88] And Merry Christmas to you this morning.
[496.88 → 506.88] Now, King David, in many Psalms, and especially Psalm 40, for instance, talks about singing a new song.
[506.88 → 512.88] And our call to worship does mention a new song.
[512.88 → 516.88] But what does he mean by a new song?
[516.88 → 523.88] It's a phrase we often see in the Bible, and it usually refers to a fresh experience of God.
[523.88 → 530.88] Right? The way that God maybe reveals himself to us in a new way.
[530.88 → 536.88] And thereby stirring in our hearts a new song and response.
[536.88 → 544.88] In Psalm 40, David talks about an experience where he was like stuck in the mire.
[544.88 → 552.88] But the Lord then drew him out and stood him on a rock and put a new song in his heart.
[552.88 → 556.88] And that's my prayer for us this morning.
[556.88 → 561.88] That God will show us his own goodness again in a new way.
[561.88 → 568.88] And in a sense, put a new song in our hearts, even as we sing maybe some old and familiar songs today,
[568.88 → 571.88] which are also new to us and good.
[571.88 → 576.88] So hear this call to worship from Psalm 149.
[576.88 → 578.88] Praise the Lord.
[578.88 → 581.88] Sing to the Lord a new song.
[581.88 → 585.88] His praise in the assembly of his faithful people.
[585.88 → 589.88] Let Israel rejoice in their maker.
[589.88 → 593.88] Let the people of Zion be glad in their king.
[593.88 → 596.88] For the Lord takes delight in his people.
[596.88 → 600.88] He crowns the humble with victory.
[600.88 → 606.88] So now let's join together in a prayer of adoration as we come before our God in worship this morning.
[606.88 → 614.88] Our Heavenly Father, we are here because of your goodness and your love for us.
[614.88 → 620.88] And Lord, we do stand in awe and wonder at all that you have done and all that you have created,
[620.88 → 625.88] the world in its vast and beautiful array that proclaims your glory,
[625.88 → 629.88] and in the human heart that you have made to know and to worship you.
[629.88 → 638.88] And it's in our Lord Jesus Christ that we see the clearest picture, Lord, of your goodness and your love.
[638.88 → 644.88] We see the Christ who came as one of us to die on our behalf and to reconcile us to you.
[644.88 → 651.88] We put our hope in your promise that he will come again in judgment to renew all things.
[651.88 → 656.88] We ask, Holy Spirit, that you would guide us in our worship in this time this morning.
[656.88 → 665.88] Would you transform our hearts, our minds, and our hands that we might walk with you in righteousness to the glory of God.
[665.88 → 668.88] We pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[668.88 → 677.88] Friends, let's stand together as we receive God's greeting to us this morning from Isaiah 9, verse 2.
[677.88 → 681.88] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[681.88 → 688.88] On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
[688.88 → 694.88] And so as God has greeted us and welcomed us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[694.88 → 696.88] Who will come back to the hats?
[696.88 → 697.88] Where are they then?
[697.88 → 698.88] Redo, thank you very much.
[698.88 → 699.88] Our God of the deep darkness.
[699.88 → 701.88] The sat cakes Adair.
[701.88 → 703.88] The trunk of the daily flesh can come.
[703.88 → 704.88] Jerome and exponent, the, THE CHURCH CONFRONTED UNDER.

[852.70 → 854.70] Thank you.
[854.70 → 861.70] Thank you.

[863.70 → 870.70] Thank you.
[870.70 → 877.70] Thank you.
[877.70 → 884.70] Thank you.
[884.70 → 886.70] Thank you.
[886.70 → 890.70] Thank you.
[907.70 → 908.70] Thank you.
[908.70 → 914.70] Thank you.
[914.70 → 915.70] Thank you.
[915.70 → 917.70] Thank you.
[917.70 → 918.70] Thank you.
[918.70 → 934.76] Who else the wrath's gone out to worship?
[936.90 → 942.76] His glory taught the stars to shine.
[942.76 → 952.62] But as creation loves to have the words to sing,
[952.62 → 959.30] that this joy is mine.
[961.56 → 969.36] In a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name.
[969.36 → 977.60] You will all deserve the glory, the honour and the praise.
[978.12 → 984.72] Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours.
[985.24 → 992.36] A thousand hallelujahs in a thousand more.
[992.36 → 1000.32] Who else can die for our redemption?
[1003.18 → 1009.52] As resurrection leads our eyes.
[1009.52 → 1017.52] There is a time enough to sing of all you've done.
[1019.60 → 1024.52] But I have eternity to trust.
[1024.52 → 1035.00] A thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name.
[1035.00 → 1043.06] You will all deserve the glory, the honour and the praise.
[1043.62 → 1049.00] Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours.
[1049.00 → 1057.78] A thousand hallelujahs in a thousand more.
[1057.78 → 1075.96] A thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name.
[1075.96 → 1084.04] You will all deserve the glory, the honour and the praise.
[1084.04 → 1091.20] Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours.
[1091.20 → 1098.20] A thousand hallelujahs in a thousand more.
[1098.20 → 1105.20] A thousand hallelujahs in a thousand more.
[1109.28 → 1110.74] A thousand hallelujahs in a thousand more.
[1110.74 → 1112.96] Praise to the Lord.
[1112.96 → 1115.96] Praise to the Lord.
[1115.96 → 1117.52] To the Lord.
[1117.52 → 1118.72] To the Lord.
[1118.72 → 1121.18] To the Lord.
[1121.18 → 1124.94] To the King of heaven.
[1124.94 → 1136.28] Praise the heroes, and He reigns
[1136.28 → 1140.18] We will sing forever
[1140.18 → 1146.94] Praise to the Lord
[1146.94 → 1151.28] To the Lamb
[1151.28 → 1155.68] To the King of Heaven
[1155.68 → 1158.46] Praise
[1158.46 → 1162.12] For He rose
[1162.12 → 1166.12] Now He reigns
[1166.12 → 1170.24] We will sing forever
[1170.24 → 1175.04] With a thousand hallelujahs
[1175.04 → 1178.60] We magnify Your name
[1178.60 → 1182.20] You alone deserve the glory
[1182.20 → 1186.20] The honour and the praise
[1186.20 → 1193.08] Oh Jesus, this song is forever Yours
[1193.08 → 1197.00] A thousand hallelujahs
[1197.00 → 1200.60] And a thousand more
[1200.60 → 1207.64] You may be seated
[1207.64 → 1223.24] Goodbye
[1223.24 → 1243.00] That's better.
[1244.22 → 1245.72] I forgot to do it earlier.
[1246.82 → 1249.02] But it is still Christmas, right?
[1249.84 → 1250.82] It's the season of Christmas,
[1250.82 → 1254.04] and so we still remember with the white candle
[1254.04 → 1255.38] that Christ has come.
[1255.54 → 1256.60] He has been incarnate.
[1256.72 → 1257.76] God with us, Emmanuel.
[1259.64 → 1263.44] So Paul says to commit yourself
[1263.44 → 1264.58] to the reading of Scripture
[1264.58 → 1267.32] in your gathered worship.
[1267.56 → 1270.06] And so our first reading today is,
[1270.48 → 1271.60] it's not in your bulletin,
[1271.66 → 1272.76] but it's the book of Daniel.
[1273.18 → 1275.30] So if you would turn to Daniel,
[1276.80 → 1278.56] and bonus points to the first person
[1278.56 → 1279.56] who calls out the number.
[1280.82 → 1292.08] So after Ezekiel, there it is.
[1294.66 → 1297.54] Page six, what is it?
[1299.60 → 1301.14] 661, page 661.
[1301.40 → 1303.10] If you'd like to follow along in the Pew Bible,
[1303.62 → 1305.10] page 661.
[1305.10 → 1313.60] And we will read a fun and familiar story
[1313.60 → 1315.58] beginning in verse 13.
[1315.74 → 1316.94] So chapter 3 of Daniel,
[1317.38 → 1318.72] beginning in verse 13.
[1319.44 → 1320.68] Furious with rage,
[1320.82 → 1324.72] Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1325.72 → 1327.88] So these men were brought before the king,
[1328.54 → 1330.30] and Nebuchadnezzar said to them,
[1330.30 → 1333.32] Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1333.64 → 1337.06] that you do not serve my gods,
[1337.30 → 1339.74] or worship the image of gold I have set up?
[1340.56 → 1343.02] Now when you hear the sound of the horn,
[1343.34 → 1345.98] flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes,
[1346.06 → 1347.20] and all kinds of music,
[1347.68 → 1349.32] if you are ready to fall down
[1349.32 → 1351.16] and worship the image I made,
[1351.52 → 1352.06] very good.
[1352.62 → 1354.28] But if you do not worship it,
[1354.68 → 1355.56] you will be thrown immediately
[1355.56 → 1357.82] into a blazing furnace.
[1359.02 → 1361.46] Then what god will be able
[1361.46 → 1363.84] to rescue you from my hands?
[1364.56 → 1366.16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[1366.16 → 1367.94] replied to the king,
[1368.48 → 1369.38] O Nebuchadnezzar,
[1369.50 → 1371.90] we do not need to defend ourselves
[1371.90 → 1373.22] before you in this matter.
[1373.76 → 1375.96] If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
[1376.48 → 1379.12] the god we serve is able to save us from it,
[1379.42 → 1381.82] and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.
[1382.38 → 1383.98] But even if he does not,
[1384.62 → 1386.06] we want you to know, O king,
[1386.12 → 1387.86] that we will not serve your gods,
[1388.06 → 1390.40] or worship the image of gold you have set up.
[1391.22 → 1392.74] Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious
[1392.74 → 1394.58] with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1395.16 → 1397.76] and his attitude toward them changed.
[1397.76 → 1399.56] He ordered the furnace heated
[1399.56 → 1401.66] seven times hotter than usual,
[1402.26 → 1404.26] and commanded some of the strongest soldiers
[1404.26 → 1408.00] in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1408.34 → 1410.70] and throw them into the blazing furnace.
[1410.70 → 1414.34] So these men, wearing their robes,
[1414.66 → 1416.52] trousers, turbans, and other clothes,
[1417.00 → 1419.62] were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
[1420.54 → 1422.32] The king's command was so urgent
[1422.32 → 1423.64] and the furnace so hot
[1423.64 → 1426.28] that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers
[1426.28 → 1428.80] who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1429.20 → 1431.24] And these three men, firmly tied,
[1431.76 → 1433.28] fell into the blazing furnace.
[1433.96 → 1436.38] Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet
[1436.38 → 1438.52] in amazement and asked his advisors,
[1438.52 → 1441.36] weren't there three men that we tied up
[1441.36 → 1442.34] and threw into the fire?
[1442.98 → 1444.94] They replied, certainly, O king.
[1445.60 → 1449.72] He said, look, I see four men walking around in the fire,
[1450.08 → 1451.84] unbound and unharmed,
[1452.34 → 1454.94] and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.
[1456.16 → 1457.96] Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening
[1457.96 → 1459.52] of the blazing furnace and shouted,
[1460.30 → 1461.76] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1462.34 → 1463.80] servants of the Most High God,
[1463.90 → 1464.94] come out, come here.
[1464.94 → 1469.10] So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire
[1469.10 → 1472.16] and the satraps, prefects, governors,
[1472.64 → 1475.16] and royal advisors crowded around them.
[1475.60 → 1477.92] They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies,
[1478.06 → 1480.58] nor was a hair of their heads singed.
[1481.04 → 1482.62] Their robes were not scorched
[1482.62 → 1484.74] and there was no smell of fire on them.
[1485.74 → 1486.84] Then Nebuchadnezzar said,
[1487.50 → 1491.50] praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1491.50 → 1495.42] who has sent his angel and rescued his servants.
[1495.92 → 1499.16] They trusted in him and defied the king's command
[1499.16 → 1501.24] and were willing to give up their lives
[1501.24 → 1504.96] rather than serve or worship any god
[1504.96 → 1506.90] except their own god.
[1507.62 → 1508.74] This is the word of the Lord.
[1509.32 → 1510.48] Thank you, God.
[1512.88 → 1514.90] Now we come to a time of confession.
[1514.90 → 1518.54] And, you know, in relationships,
[1518.82 → 1520.34] whether it's with our friends or family,
[1521.16 → 1522.62] sometimes we don't really know
[1522.62 → 1525.64] what is preoccupying someone's mind.
[1526.62 → 1527.14] Right?
[1527.26 → 1529.46] Maybe they're running in their minds
[1529.46 → 1531.26] through a problem they're trying to solve,
[1531.52 → 1534.54] or maybe they're preoccupied with a regret
[1534.54 → 1536.28] of something maybe they said,
[1536.70 → 1538.62] or they're planning for something to come.
[1538.62 → 1540.92] But you can often tell
[1540.92 → 1543.10] if someone's mind is preoccupied
[1543.10 → 1545.14] because they're not listening to you
[1545.14 → 1546.46] when you try to talk to them.
[1547.94 → 1550.68] And as we confess our sins this morning,
[1551.18 → 1554.54] our sin can preoccupy our minds.
[1556.38 → 1558.40] And so my encouragement to us this morning,
[1558.82 → 1560.22] as we confess our sins,
[1560.32 → 1564.42] is to cast our cares upon the living God
[1564.42 → 1566.34] who forgives our sins
[1566.34 → 1567.82] and who gives us a clear mind
[1567.82 → 1569.86] and a heart that is at peace.
[1570.48 → 1571.90] So that then we can focus
[1571.90 → 1573.32] on what is right and good
[1573.32 → 1576.62] and also focus on our Lord Jesus.
[1577.62 → 1580.96] So let's come before the Lord now
[1580.96 → 1582.10] in a prayer of confession,
[1582.34 → 1583.58] and I will lead us as we pray.
[1583.98 → 1584.96] So please pray with me.
[1586.36 → 1589.02] Our loving and our merciful Father,
[1589.42 → 1590.30] Lord, we confess
[1590.30 → 1593.62] that we are often preoccupied
[1593.62 → 1595.92] with ourselves,
[1596.34 → 1599.02] sometimes with our own plans,
[1599.78 → 1601.52] sometimes with our own failings.
[1602.48 → 1604.20] But in our preoccupation,
[1604.28 → 1606.44] we neglect our devotion to you,
[1606.88 → 1608.46] the call to love our brothers
[1608.46 → 1609.58] and sisters in Christ
[1609.58 → 1610.70] as you have loved us,
[1611.44 → 1612.56] and the command to love
[1612.56 → 1613.74] our neighbours as ourselves.
[1614.82 → 1616.46] Lord, in your loving kindness,
[1617.00 → 1618.24] have mercy upon us
[1618.24 → 1620.18] and free us from our sins.
[1620.92 → 1622.54] Lord, remind us of your promises
[1622.54 → 1623.82] made to us in Christ
[1623.82 → 1626.46] so that we may be raised to new life
[1626.46 → 1628.36] and love you with all of our heart,
[1628.50 → 1629.62] soul, mind, and strength
[1629.62 → 1631.76] and to love our neighbours as ourselves.
[1632.26 → 1634.14] We pray this through Jesus Christ,
[1634.20 → 1634.56] our Lord.
[1635.08 → 1635.44] Amen.
[1637.76 → 1639.96] Now hear these words of pardon.
[1639.96 → 1643.42] the Lord says in Isaiah,
[1644.42 → 1646.08] I, even I,
[1646.54 → 1648.26] am he who blots out
[1648.26 → 1649.52] your transgressions
[1649.52 → 1651.14] for my own sake
[1651.14 → 1654.06] and remembers your sins no more.
[1654.64 → 1655.50] Praise be to God.
[1655.90 → 1657.10] Let's stand and let's sing
[1657.10 → 1658.44] a song of response together.
[1658.44 → 1660.36] Let's sing Wait RP
[1660.36 → 1661.12] Lindsay
[1661.12 → 1662.10] aedicula
[1662.10 → 1678.72] teens are falling,
[1682.72 → 1685.10] hearts are breaking,
[1685.44 → 1688.08] now we need to hear from God,
[1688.08 → 1694.24] You've been promised, we've been waiting
[1694.24 → 1698.34] Welcome, Holy Child
[1698.34 → 1702.20] Welcome, Holy Child
[1702.20 → 1713.96] Hope that you don't mind our manger
[1713.96 → 1717.88] How I wish we would have known
[1717.88 → 1722.82] Hope, bring your peace into the stranger
[1722.82 → 1726.74] Make yourself at home
[1726.74 → 1731.38] Please, make yourself at home
[1731.38 → 1742.48] Bring your peace into our violence
[1742.48 → 1746.28] Let our hungry souls be filled
[1746.28 → 1751.22] We're now breaking heaven's silence
[1751.22 → 1755.14] Welcome to our world
[1755.14 → 1759.14] Welcome to our world
[1759.14 → 1769.00] Fragile fingers
[1769.00 → 1773.94] Set to heal us, tender brown people
[1773.94 → 1779.88] Tiny hunters, that will save us
[1779.88 → 1783.80] Unto us is born
[1783.80 → 1788.80] Unto us is born
[1788.80 → 1799.66] So, wrap our injured flesh around you
[1799.66 → 1803.74] Breathe our air and walk our soul
[1803.74 → 1808.46] Rub our sins and make us holy
[1808.46 → 1813.40] Perfect Son of God
[1813.40 → 1817.32] Perfect Son of God
[1817.32 → 1823.32] Welcome to our world
[1823.32 → 1844.12] And our children are dismissed to go to their sunny school classes
[1844.12 → 1866.76] So, during the season of Advent
[1866.76 → 1867.62] And now into Christmas
[1867.62 → 1872.20] We have been looking to some of the ancient believers
[1872.20 → 1874.32] That came before us
[1874.32 → 1876.76] Right, who were commended by God
[1876.76 → 1879.10] For how they waited upon the promises of God
[1879.10 → 1880.90] How they lived in faith
[1880.90 → 1885.76] And today, we continue in Hebrews chapter 11
[1885.76 → 1888.36] And as we do so, we have quite a full cast
[1888.36 → 1890.36] Of heroes of the faith
[1890.36 → 1892.26] For us to consider
[1892.26 → 1895.36] And so, today we are going to read
[1895.36 → 1898.72] Actually, verses 32 to 40
[1898.72 → 1900.04] So, to the end of the chapter
[1900.04 → 1901.64] Beginning of verse 32
[1901.64 → 1903.26] To the end of the chapter
[1903.26 → 1905.58] So, let's give our attention to the reading of God's word
[1905.58 → 1908.58] And what more shall I say?
[1909.34 → 1911.52] I do not have time to tell about Gideon
[1911.52 → 1912.38] Barak
[1912.38 → 1913.26] Samson
[1913.26 → 1914.06] Jephthah
[1914.06 → 1914.98] David
[1914.98 → 1915.92] Samuel
[1915.92 → 1916.84] And the prophets
[1916.84 → 1918.42] Who through faith
[1918.42 → 1919.54] Conquered kingdoms
[1919.54 → 1921.26] Administered justice
[1921.26 → 1923.04] And gained what was promised
[1923.04 → 1925.44] Who shut the mouths of lions
[1925.44 → 1927.84] Quenched the fury of the flames
[1927.84 → 1929.68] And escaped the edge of the sword
[1929.68 → 1932.52] Whose weakness was turned to strength
[1932.52 → 1934.80] And who became powerful in battle
[1934.80 → 1936.68] And rooted foreign armies
[1936.68 → 1939.20] Women received back from
[1939.20 → 1940.54] Back their dead
[1940.54 → 1942.16] Raised to life again
[1942.16 → 1943.88] Others were tortured
[1943.88 → 1945.42] And refused to be released
[1945.42 → 1946.74] So that they might gain
[1946.74 → 1947.84] A better resurrection
[1947.84 → 1950.50] Some faced jeers and flogging
[1950.50 → 1952.40] While still others were chained
[1952.40 → 1953.20] And put in prison
[1953.20 → 1954.56] They were stoned
[1954.56 → 1955.94] They were sawed in two
[1955.94 → 1957.46] They were put to death
[1957.46 → 1958.34] By the sword
[1958.34 → 1959.46] They went about
[1959.46 → 1960.46] In sheepskins
[1960.46 → 1961.40] And goatskins
[1961.40 → 1962.58] Destitute
[1962.58 → 1963.62] Persecuted
[1963.62 → 1964.80] And mistreated
[1964.80 → 1966.16] The world
[1966.16 → 1967.74] Was not worthy of them
[1967.74 → 1969.18] They wandered
[1969.18 → 1970.68] In deserts
[1970.68 → 1971.60] And mountains
[1971.60 → 1972.88] And in caves
[1972.88 → 1974.06] And in holes in the ground
[1974.06 → 1975.92] These were all commended
[1975.92 → 1976.78] For their faith
[1976.78 → 1978.60] Yet none of them received
[1978.60 → 1979.68] What they had been promised
[1979.68 → 1981.18] God had planned
[1981.18 → 1982.66] Something better for us
[1982.66 → 1984.46] So that only together
[1984.46 → 1985.36] With us
[1985.36 → 1986.40] Would they
[1986.40 → 1987.80] Be made perfect
[1987.80 → 1989.84] This is the word of the Lord
[1989.84 → 1992.82] So please
[1992.82 → 1993.96] Join me in prayer
[1993.96 → 1995.42] As we ask for God's blessing
[1995.42 → 1996.80] Upon his word this morning
[1996.80 → 1998.16] Our heavenly father
[1998.16 → 1999.08] We thank you again
[1999.08 → 1999.72] This morning
[1999.72 → 2000.56] For your word
[2000.56 → 2002.92] Which is absolutely true
[2002.92 → 2004.02] And given to us
[2004.02 → 2004.66] In love
[2004.66 → 2006.34] We ask now Lord
[2006.34 → 2007.02] That you would shine
[2007.02 → 2008.56] The light of your truth
[2008.56 → 2009.56] Into our hearts
[2009.56 → 2011.12] So that we would
[2011.12 → 2012.80] So that you would enable us
[2012.80 → 2013.96] To shine as lights
[2013.96 → 2014.56] In the world
[2014.56 → 2016.26] As we wait
[2016.26 → 2017.46] In faith
[2017.46 → 2017.94] And hope
[2017.94 → 2018.42] And love
[2018.42 → 2019.14] For the coming
[2019.14 → 2020.32] Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2020.32 → 2022.02] We ask in his name
[2022.02 → 2022.82] And for his sake
[2022.82 → 2023.52] Amen
[2023.52 → 2026.46] So this morning
[2026.46 → 2027.16] I want to begin
[2027.16 → 2028.16] With a quote
[2028.16 → 2031.14] And it's by the 19th century
[2031.14 → 2032.68] American novelist
[2032.68 → 2033.36] And humorist
[2033.36 → 2034.16] Mark Twain
[2034.16 → 2036.30] So he said this
[2036.30 → 2040.12] Few things
[2040.12 → 2041.00] Are harder
[2041.00 → 2042.04] To put up with
[2042.04 → 2044.08] Than the annoyance
[2044.08 → 2045.06] Of a good example
[2045.06 → 2047.80] See he's a funny guy
[2047.80 → 2051.00] Now why do you think
[2051.00 → 2051.88] He says this
[2051.88 → 2053.08] Right
[2053.08 → 2055.20] Why are good examples
[2055.20 → 2057.78] Hard to put up with
[2057.78 → 2059.76] Well I think it's because
[2059.76 → 2060.54] A good example
[2060.54 → 2061.60] Shows us
[2061.60 → 2062.40] Truth
[2062.40 → 2063.44] In action
[2063.44 → 2064.26] Right
[2064.26 → 2065.26] It shows us truth
[2065.26 → 2066.96] Being lived out
[2066.96 → 2068.32] You know
[2068.32 → 2069.06] And so when someone
[2069.06 → 2070.36] Is trying to convince you
[2070.36 → 2072.08] Of something that is true
[2072.08 → 2073.20] It's a lot harder
[2073.20 → 2075.20] To dismiss it
[2075.20 → 2077.20] If there is a good example
[2077.20 → 2078.60] To back it up
[2078.60 → 2080.36] So for example
[2080.36 → 2081.42] I could tell you
[2081.42 → 2082.54] The biblical truth
[2082.54 → 2083.46] That you know
[2083.46 → 2085.02] We should forgive
[2085.02 → 2085.70] One another
[2085.70 → 2087.32] Okay
[2087.32 → 2089.44] But it's more powerful
[2089.44 → 2090.50] If
[2090.50 → 2092.36] I tell you a story
[2092.36 → 2093.90] A true story
[2093.90 → 2094.82] Of two neighbours
[2094.82 → 2096.54] Who had been fighting
[2096.54 → 2097.80] For like ten years
[2097.80 → 2098.34] Over
[2098.34 → 2099.22] You know
[2099.22 → 2100.30] Fence lines
[2100.30 → 2101.30] And noise
[2101.30 → 2102.28] And dogs
[2102.28 → 2103.08] And all kinds of things
[2103.08 → 2103.60] Like that
[2103.60 → 2105.60] But then one decides
[2105.60 → 2106.94] To forgive the other
[2106.94 → 2108.14] And now they have
[2108.14 → 2109.10] Barbecues together
[2109.10 → 2109.80] On the weekends
[2109.80 → 2112.90] Or I could say
[2112.90 → 2113.90] The biblical truth
[2113.90 → 2115.70] We need to endure
[2115.70 → 2116.78] And stay faithful
[2116.78 → 2117.38] In suffering
[2117.38 → 2119.62] But it's more powerful
[2119.62 → 2120.80] If I tell you the story
[2120.80 → 2122.30] About a high school girl
[2122.30 → 2123.56] Who suffered for years
[2123.56 → 2124.30] With leukemia
[2124.30 → 2126.00] Who was always
[2126.00 → 2126.86] Too weak
[2126.86 → 2128.10] To even leave her house
[2128.10 → 2130.38] But one time
[2130.38 → 2132.00] She actually felt
[2132.00 → 2132.62] Strong enough
[2132.62 → 2133.40] To leave the house
[2133.40 → 2134.38] And she used
[2134.38 → 2135.90] Her precious energy
[2135.90 → 2137.60] To come to church
[2137.60 → 2139.30] And to attend
[2139.30 → 2140.60] A bible study
[2140.60 → 2141.40] At youth group
[2141.40 → 2143.50] Her name was Susan
[2143.50 → 2148.02] For those of us
[2148.02 → 2149.52] Who want to live
[2149.52 → 2150.26] By faith
[2150.26 → 2151.62] One of the most
[2151.62 → 2152.74] Powerful things
[2152.74 → 2153.74] That can help us
[2153.74 → 2155.50] Is a good example
[2155.50 → 2158.14] And in Hebrews 11
[2158.14 → 2159.12] The author of Hebrews
[2159.12 → 2160.46] Is he's coming along
[2160.46 → 2161.50] And he's saying to us
[2161.50 → 2163.12] Now let me tell you
[2163.12 → 2164.18] Some stories
[2164.18 → 2166.12] Of people who lived
[2166.12 → 2166.80] By faith
[2166.80 → 2167.74] Right
[2167.74 → 2169.10] Believing that Jesus
[2169.10 → 2170.44] Is better
[2170.44 → 2172.86] Even when it was costly
[2172.86 → 2175.32] And over the last few weeks
[2175.32 → 2176.32] We've looked at
[2176.32 → 2176.98] Some of the
[2176.98 → 2178.10] The big examples
[2178.10 → 2179.20] Of Enoch
[2179.20 → 2180.30] And Noah
[2180.30 → 2181.42] Abraham
[2181.42 → 2182.36] And Moses
[2182.36 → 2184.42] And on Christmas day
[2184.42 → 2185.54] We looked at the example
[2185.54 → 2186.32] Of Joseph
[2186.32 → 2187.86] From the Gospel of Matthew
[2187.86 → 2188.90] Who you know
[2188.90 → 2189.50] By faith
[2189.50 → 2191.22] Joseph took his wife Mary
[2191.22 → 2193.18] As his wife
[2193.18 → 2194.60] And adopted her son
[2194.60 → 2195.68] And named him Jesus
[2195.68 → 2198.12] And now in our passage
[2198.12 → 2198.68] This morning
[2198.68 → 2199.70] The author of Hebrews
[2199.70 → 2201.62] He kind of flies through
[2201.62 → 2203.62] Over a dozen examples
[2203.62 → 2204.74] Of those who have lived
[2204.74 → 2205.32] By faith
[2205.32 → 2207.30] Who lived in such a way
[2207.30 → 2209.18] That the future promises
[2209.18 → 2210.36] Of God were present
[2210.36 → 2211.00] To them
[2211.00 → 2212.64] And the invisible
[2212.64 → 2214.20] Was seen
[2214.20 → 2215.92] Seen through the eyes
[2215.92 → 2216.34] Of faith
[2216.34 → 2217.98] And the first examples
[2217.98 → 2219.26] He gives us
[2219.26 → 2221.14] Come from a time
[2221.14 → 2222.98] In Israel's history
[2222.98 → 2224.72] When there were
[2224.72 → 2226.20] Judges
[2226.20 → 2227.58] Kings
[2227.58 → 2228.62] And prophets
[2228.62 → 2229.20] Okay
[2229.20 → 2229.68] Judges
[2229.68 → 2229.98] Kings
[2229.98 → 2230.50] And prophets
[2230.50 → 2232.62] And these are
[2232.62 → 2233.84] The kinds of stories
[2233.84 → 2234.74] That we love to hear
[2234.74 → 2235.62] Right
[2235.62 → 2236.80] There are about people
[2236.80 → 2237.98] Who trusted in God
[2237.98 → 2239.92] And great things
[2239.92 → 2240.46] Happened
[2240.46 → 2241.20] They conquered
[2241.20 → 2242.58] Or they escaped
[2242.58 → 2244.14] And so look with me
[2244.14 → 2245.20] At verse 32
[2245.20 → 2247.42] So he begins like this
[2247.42 → 2248.60] And what more shall I say
[2248.60 → 2249.90] I don't have time
[2249.90 → 2251.38] To tell about Gideon
[2251.38 → 2251.98] Barak
[2251.98 → 2252.56] Samson
[2252.56 → 2254.00] And Japheth
[2254.00 → 2255.24] About David
[2255.24 → 2255.90] And Samuel
[2255.90 → 2257.20] And the prophets
[2257.20 → 2259.86] But we do
[2259.86 → 2261.38] Have some time
[2261.38 → 2263.36] And so we will tell
[2263.36 → 2264.08] A little bit
[2264.08 → 2265.78] About each one of them
[2265.78 → 2266.34] Okay
[2266.34 → 2267.42] And so let's think about them
[2267.42 → 2267.94] Gideon
[2267.94 → 2270.10] God called him
[2270.10 → 2271.36] To lead Israel
[2271.36 → 2272.76] To fight against
[2272.76 → 2273.72] Their oppressors
[2273.72 → 2274.98] He was faithful
[2274.98 → 2275.72] To tear down
[2275.72 → 2276.84] The altar of Baal
[2276.84 → 2278.64] And at God's direction
[2278.64 → 2279.74] If you remember
[2279.74 → 2280.84] He had an army
[2280.84 → 2282.04] Of 32,000
[2282.04 → 2282.94] And God had him
[2282.94 → 2283.90] Whittle it down
[2283.90 → 2285.06] To 300
[2285.06 → 2287.56] And then he armed them
[2287.56 → 2288.26] With torches
[2288.26 → 2289.10] And clay pots
[2289.10 → 2290.12] And trumpets
[2290.12 → 2291.74] And went out
[2291.74 → 2292.86] To take on
[2292.86 → 2293.94] The Mediaite army
[2293.94 → 2295.86] It was a great act
[2295.86 → 2296.54] Of faith
[2296.54 → 2298.04] And because of that
[2298.04 → 2299.42] They prevailed
[2299.42 → 2300.92] And likewise
[2300.92 → 2301.46] Barak
[2301.46 → 2303.16] Obeying God's word
[2303.16 → 2304.66] Went to deliver Israel
[2304.66 → 2306.22] From Sisera
[2306.22 → 2307.10] The Canaanite
[2307.10 → 2308.66] And he was victorious
[2308.66 → 2309.38] Through faith
[2309.38 → 2311.80] Samson was a Nazarite
[2311.80 → 2312.30] Right
[2312.30 → 2313.48] He was dedicated
[2313.48 → 2314.58] To God's service
[2314.58 → 2316.38] He knew
[2316.38 → 2317.90] God had given him
[2317.90 → 2318.96] Incredible strength
[2318.96 → 2320.16] And he knew
[2320.16 → 2321.10] What he had to do
[2321.10 → 2323.06] To deliver Israel
[2323.06 → 2324.02] From the Philistines
[2324.02 → 2325.82] And then we have
[2325.82 → 2326.96] Japheth
[2326.96 → 2327.68] I always kind of
[2327.68 → 2328.34] Trip over his name
[2328.34 → 2330.10] He was actually
[2330.10 → 2332.42] An illegitimate son
[2332.42 → 2334.34] Kind of outcast
[2334.34 → 2334.74] Hebrew
[2334.74 → 2336.48] But then he was
[2336.48 → 2337.56] Called back
[2337.56 → 2338.78] To help his people
[2338.78 → 2339.94] And by faith
[2339.94 → 2340.56] In God
[2340.56 → 2341.62] He delivers them
[2341.62 → 2342.30] And defeats
[2342.30 → 2343.00] The Ammonites
[2343.00 → 2343.68] Okay
[2343.68 → 2344.44] He conquered
[2344.44 → 2345.82] Because of his faith
[2345.82 → 2346.78] His trust in God
[2346.78 → 2348.58] King David
[2348.58 → 2349.12] We all know
[2349.12 → 2349.98] As a man of faith
[2349.98 → 2350.24] Right
[2350.24 → 2351.08] I mean
[2351.08 → 2351.52] When you think
[2351.52 → 2352.06] About David
[2352.06 → 2352.80] What do you think of
[2352.80 → 2355.10] David and Goliath
[2355.10 → 2356.58] In the time
[2356.58 → 2357.36] When he stood
[2357.36 → 2358.84] Before a towering giant
[2358.84 → 2359.78] And he called out
[2359.78 → 2360.68] It is not
[2360.68 → 2361.60] By sword
[2361.60 → 2362.48] Or spear
[2362.48 → 2363.78] That the Lord saves
[2363.78 → 2364.94] But the battle
[2364.94 → 2366.06] Is the Lord's
[2366.06 → 2367.16] And he will give
[2367.16 → 2368.30] All of you
[2368.30 → 2370.20] Into our hands
[2370.20 → 2371.74] Right
[2371.74 → 2372.68] A great act
[2372.68 → 2373.94] Of faith
[2373.94 → 2376.00] You know
[2376.00 → 2377.10] The prophet Samuel
[2377.10 → 2378.20] He lived a life
[2378.20 → 2378.56] Of faith
[2378.56 → 2379.76] Ever since a little boy
[2379.76 → 2380.70] Wearing
[2380.70 → 2381.48] Linen
[2381.48 → 2382.26] And linen
[2382.26 → 2383.46] Ephod
[2383.46 → 2384.30] Right
[2384.30 → 2385.12] Serving in the house
[2385.12 → 2385.64] Of the Lord
[2385.64 → 2386.62] With Eli the prophet
[2386.62 → 2388.86] And he continued
[2388.86 → 2389.80] On in faith
[2389.80 → 2390.58] As a prophet
[2390.58 → 2391.74] And one of the things
[2391.74 → 2392.72] We know about Samuel
[2392.72 → 2394.82] Is that he would
[2394.82 → 2396.48] Say God's word
[2396.48 → 2397.80] Anywhere
[2397.80 → 2399.00] Anytime
[2399.00 → 2399.94] To anyone
[2399.94 → 2401.78] Even to the likes
[2401.78 → 2402.56] Of King Saul
[2402.56 → 2403.86] Israel's first king
[2403.86 → 2405.54] And that's the way
[2405.54 → 2406.20] It was with all
[2406.20 → 2406.80] The prophets
[2406.80 → 2407.62] Right
[2407.62 → 2409.08] They spoke God's word
[2409.08 → 2410.62] As an act of faith
[2410.62 → 2411.98] They would have
[2411.98 → 2412.68] The courage
[2412.68 → 2413.56] To proclaim
[2413.56 → 2415.02] God's purposes
[2415.02 → 2416.78] And speak truth
[2416.78 → 2417.54] To power
[2417.54 → 2419.66] So these were
[2419.66 → 2421.26] Amazing examples
[2421.26 → 2422.10] Heroes
[2422.10 → 2423.42] Of faith
[2423.42 → 2426.20] And among these stories
[2426.20 → 2426.84] As we look at
[2426.84 → 2427.60] This kind of stories
[2427.60 → 2428.48] Here in verse 32
[2428.48 → 2430.10] There are two
[2430.10 → 2431.56] Kind of striking similarities
[2431.56 → 2432.34] Between them
[2432.34 → 2433.76] The first similarity
[2433.76 → 2435.30] Is that
[2435.30 → 2436.48] Each one of them
[2436.48 → 2437.58] Lived in a time
[2437.58 → 2439.62] When faith was scarce
[2439.62 → 2441.02] Okay
[2441.02 → 2442.24] They each lived in a time
[2442.24 → 2444.04] When faith was scarce
[2444.04 → 2445.04] Faithful people
[2445.04 → 2446.20] Were in the minority
[2446.20 → 2447.44] And the days
[2447.44 → 2448.56] Seemed dark
[2448.56 → 2450.44] And as a result
[2450.44 → 2451.72] They stood out
[2451.72 → 2453.00] For their acts of faith
[2453.00 → 2453.86] Every one of them
[2453.86 → 2455.42] As lights
[2455.42 → 2456.34] In the world
[2456.34 → 2457.82] Against
[2457.82 → 2458.96] Overcoming
[2458.96 → 2460.62] Overwhelming odds
[2460.62 → 2463.88] And the second
[2463.88 → 2464.54] Fascinating
[2464.54 → 2465.26] Similarity
[2465.26 → 2465.78] Is that
[2465.78 → 2466.66] All of these
[2466.66 → 2467.46] Heroes of faith
[2467.46 → 2468.66] Were all
[2468.66 → 2469.36] Very flawed
[2469.36 → 2471.44] They were all
[2471.44 → 2472.80] Very flawed
[2472.80 → 2474.16] Gideon
[2474.16 → 2475.58] Was hiding
[2475.58 → 2476.78] From the Mediates
[2476.78 → 2477.80] In a wine press
[2477.80 → 2478.62] When God
[2478.62 → 2479.24] Called him
[2479.24 → 2481.82] And he insisted
[2481.82 → 2482.60] On testing
[2482.60 → 2483.38] God's word
[2483.38 → 2484.46] Over and over
[2484.46 → 2485.20] With the fleece
[2485.20 → 2485.72] And the dew
[2485.72 → 2487.18] Right
[2487.18 → 2487.90] And so with
[2487.90 → 2488.98] Great difficulty
[2488.98 → 2490.42] Was he finally
[2490.42 → 2491.64] Able to commit
[2491.64 → 2492.64] Himself to the Lord
[2492.64 → 2495.10] Barak had to be
[2495.10 → 2495.80] Compelled
[2495.80 → 2497.06] To go out
[2497.06 → 2498.28] By the reproaches
[2498.28 → 2499.14] Of Deborah
[2499.14 → 2500.28] And then he wouldn't
[2500.28 → 2500.90] Even go
[2500.90 → 2501.54] Unless she came
[2501.54 → 2502.02] With him
[2502.02 → 2504.38] Samson's
[2504.38 → 2504.92] Ill treatment
[2504.92 → 2505.54] Of women
[2505.54 → 2506.40] Ends up being
[2506.40 → 2507.32] His downfall
[2507.32 → 2508.34] As Delia
[2508.34 → 2509.44] Cuts his hair
[2509.44 → 2510.64] Causing him
[2510.64 → 2511.68] To lose his strength
[2511.68 → 2513.92] Japheth
[2513.92 → 2515.20] He rushed
[2515.20 → 2515.84] Headlong
[2515.84 → 2516.48] Into making
[2516.48 → 2517.10] A rash
[2517.10 → 2517.60] Vow
[2517.60 → 2518.44] That he would
[2518.44 → 2519.02] Sacrifice
[2519.02 → 2519.56] The first thing
[2519.56 → 2519.88] That came
[2519.88 → 2520.50] Through his door
[2520.50 → 2521.30] Which ended up
[2521.30 → 2521.98] Being his daughter
[2521.98 → 2524.30] And then he
[2524.30 → 2525.22] Foolishly
[2525.22 → 2526.14] Insisted
[2526.14 → 2527.26] On carrying
[2527.26 → 2528.02] Out his vow
[2528.02 → 2530.06] And he ends
[2530.06 → 2530.76] Up battling
[2530.76 → 2531.62] Against his
[2531.62 → 2532.44] Fellow Israelites
[2532.44 → 2533.18] Killing a thousand
[2533.18 → 2533.62] Of them
[2533.62 → 2536.30] King David
[2536.30 → 2538.48] We all know
[2538.48 → 2539.42] He was overcome
[2539.42 → 2540.08] By lust
[2540.08 → 2541.44] The prophet
[2541.44 → 2542.26] Samuel
[2542.26 → 2543.34] Lapsed into
[2543.34 → 2544.02] Carelessness
[2544.02 → 2544.88] About his own
[2544.88 → 2545.36] Sons
[2545.36 → 2546.26] Resulting in
[2546.26 → 2546.96] Family tragedy
[2546.96 → 2549.84] So each one
[2549.84 → 2550.78] Of these examples
[2550.78 → 2552.24] Of great faith
[2552.24 → 2554.22] Are of people
[2554.22 → 2554.96] Who are also
[2554.96 → 2555.82] Flawed
[2555.82 → 2557.70] And the Bible
[2557.70 → 2558.92] Is honest about that
[2558.92 → 2560.36] And so John Calvin
[2560.36 → 2561.30] He's commenting
[2561.30 → 2562.02] On this passage
[2562.02 → 2562.82] He says this
[2562.82 → 2565.58] In every saint
[2565.58 → 2566.26] There's always
[2566.26 → 2566.98] To be found
[2566.98 → 2567.48] Something
[2567.48 → 2568.84] Reprehensible
[2568.84 → 2570.30] Nevertheless
[2570.30 → 2572.10] Although faith
[2572.10 → 2572.66] May be
[2572.66 → 2573.52] Imperfect
[2573.52 → 2574.70] And incomplete
[2574.70 → 2576.24] It does not
[2576.24 → 2577.06] Cease to be
[2577.06 → 2577.70] Approved
[2577.70 → 2578.52] By God
[2578.52 → 2579.80] And then he
[2579.80 → 2580.86] Goes on and says
[2580.86 → 2582.20] There is no
[2582.20 → 2583.00] Reason therefore
[2583.00 → 2584.90] Why the fault
[2584.90 → 2585.76] From which
[2585.76 → 2586.74] We labour
[2586.74 → 2587.86] He's talking about
[2587.86 → 2588.40] Our sins
[2588.40 → 2589.30] Our own failings
[2589.30 → 2591.56] Why they should
[2591.56 → 2592.64] Break us
[2592.64 → 2594.38] Or discourage us
[2594.38 → 2596.16] Provided we go
[2596.16 → 2597.86] On by faith
[2597.86 → 2599.16] In the race
[2599.16 → 2600.62] Of our calling
[2600.62 → 2603.28] You know
[2603.28 → 2604.06] And that is
[2604.06 → 2605.12] So encouraging
[2605.12 → 2606.76] To every one
[2606.76 → 2607.26] Of us
[2607.26 → 2608.00] Here today
[2608.00 → 2609.46] Right because
[2609.46 → 2610.52] Just like those
[2610.52 → 2611.30] Ancient believers
[2611.30 → 2612.86] We also have
[2612.86 → 2614.58] Our own flaws
[2614.58 → 2615.42] And weaknesses
[2615.42 → 2617.74] But even with
[2617.74 → 2618.40] All of that
[2618.40 → 2619.16] By faith
[2619.16 → 2620.02] Because of God's
[2620.02 → 2620.50] Mercy
[2620.50 → 2622.32] We can go on
[2622.32 → 2623.28] Trusting God
[2623.28 → 2624.56] And we can be
[2624.56 → 2626.04] Approved by God
[2626.04 → 2627.22] When we do
[2627.22 → 2628.16] Act in faith
[2628.16 → 2631.26] That's an important
[2631.26 → 2632.12] Lesson for us
[2632.12 → 2632.46] Today
[2632.46 → 2634.00] So next
[2634.00 → 2634.44] The author
[2634.44 → 2635.20] Continues by
[2635.20 → 2635.92] Telling us
[2635.92 → 2637.20] About the
[2637.20 → 2638.36] Power of faith
[2638.36 → 2638.70] And he
[2638.70 → 2639.40] Goes on
[2639.40 → 2639.74] In verses
[2639.74 → 2640.48] 33 and
[2640.48 → 2640.90] 34
[2640.90 → 2641.98] And these
[2641.98 → 2642.60] Are examples
[2642.60 → 2643.60] Of what
[2643.60 → 2644.26] Faith
[2644.26 → 2645.12] Does
[2645.12 → 2646.16] The acts
[2646.16 → 2646.86] Of faith
[2646.86 → 2648.06] It says
[2648.06 → 2648.52] Who
[2648.52 → 2649.56] Like all these
[2649.56 → 2649.90] Names
[2649.90 → 2650.48] Who through
[2650.48 → 2650.92] Faith
[2650.92 → 2652.62] Conquered kingdoms
[2652.62 → 2654.48] Administered justice
[2654.48 → 2655.08] And gained
[2655.08 → 2655.86] What was promised
[2655.86 → 2656.86] Who shut
[2656.86 → 2657.30] The mouths
[2657.30 → 2657.92] Of lions
[2657.92 → 2658.90] Quenched the
[2658.90 → 2660.10] Fury of flames
[2660.10 → 2660.88] And escaped
[2660.88 → 2661.44] The edge
[2661.44 → 2662.14] Of the sword
[2662.14 → 2663.46] Whose weakness
[2663.46 → 2664.08] Was turned
[2664.08 → 2664.88] To strength
[2664.88 → 2665.58] Who became
[2665.58 → 2666.80] Powerful in battle
[2666.80 → 2667.58] And rooted
[2667.58 → 2668.96] Foreign armies
[2668.96 → 2671.92] Now who is the
[2671.92 → 2672.44] One who shut
[2672.44 → 2672.82] The mouths
[2672.82 → 2673.38] Of lions
[2673.38 → 2676.26] Daniel
[2676.26 → 2677.98] Okay well
[2677.98 → 2678.72] He's kind of
[2678.72 → 2679.30] A perfect
[2679.30 → 2679.86] Example
[2679.86 → 2680.70] Others did
[2680.70 → 2681.10] As well
[2681.10 → 2681.70] But by
[2681.70 → 2682.10] Daniel
[2682.10 → 2682.32] Right
[2682.32 → 2682.80] Just by

[3655.22 → 3660.16] We'll walk in the light
[3660.16 → 3663.72] Beautiful light
[3663.72 → 3667.78] Come where the two drops
[3667.78 → 3670.66] Let our nicely shine bright
[3670.66 → 3674.86] Oh, shine all around us
[3674.86 → 3678.72] The day and the night
[3678.72 → 3684.22] Jesus, the light of the world
[3684.22 → 3693.10] Christ, my God, is dead and dark
[3693.10 → 3698.28] Jesus, the light of the world
[3698.28 → 3703.78] Christ, my God, is dead and dark
[3703.78 → 3709.28] The last thing full of our Jesus
[3709.28 → 3712.28] The light of the world
[3712.28 → 3717.50] We'll walk in the light
[3718.16 → 3721.00] Beautiful light
[3721.00 → 3726.50] Come where the two drops of mercy
[3726.50 → 3732.00] Shine all around us
[3732.00 → 3736.00] And lay in my life
[3736.00 → 3741.00] Jesus, the light of the world
[3741.00 → 3746.50] Hail, the Lord
[3746.50 → 3750.00] Born Prince of Peace
[3750.00 → 3755.00] Jesus, the light of the world
[3755.00 → 3763.00] Hail, the Son of Righteousness
[3763.00 → 3769.00] Jesus, the light of the world
[3769.00 → 3770.50] We'll walk in the world
[3770.50 → 3774.50] We'll walk in the light
[3774.50 → 3777.50] Beautiful light
[3777.50 → 3781.50] Come where the two drops
[3781.50 → 3783.00] The drops of mercy
[3783.00 → 3783.50] The drops of mercy
[3783.50 → 3785.00] Shine now
[3785.00 → 3789.00] Oh, shine all around us
[3789.00 → 3793.00] By day and by night
[3793.00 → 3798.00] Jesus, the light of the world
[3798.00 → 3814.40] So one of the ways that we respond
[3814.40 → 3815.56] to God's word
[3815.56 → 3817.82] is of course through song
[3817.82 → 3818.86] and singing of his mercy
[3818.86 → 3820.66] and also though of responding
[3820.66 → 3823.02] by giving of our offerings to God
[3823.02 → 3825.88] for the sake of his kingdom purposes
[3825.88 → 3828.70] And our designated offering this morning
[3828.70 → 3831.40] is for Hannah van der Camp
[3831.40 → 3833.04] who's serving with her family
[3833.04 → 3836.32] in Greece on the island of Lesbos
[3836.32 → 3838.60] working amongst refugees
[3838.60 → 3842.72] And so we are delighted to partner with her
[3842.72 → 3843.62] and to support her
[3843.62 → 3844.76] through Resonate Global Mission
[3844.76 → 3847.60] May I invite our deacons
[3847.60 → 3849.48] to collect the offering this morning
[3855.88 → 3859.62] by wine
[3859.62 → 3863.04] He's there
[3863.04 → 3864.80] by thole
[3864.80 → 3865.66] here
[3865.66 → 3866.90] Corinne
[3866.90 → 3867.28] We'll join
[3867.28 → 3869.32] in the blessed
[3869.32 → 3870.58] よろ it or
[3870.58 → 3882.96] we're UIT-
[3882.96 → 3884.96] Amen.
[3912.96 → 3914.96] Amen.
[3942.96 → 3944.96] Amen.
[3972.96 → 3974.96] Amen.
[3985.48 → 3989.46] So let's continue to worship, going to the Lord in prayer together,
[3989.98 → 3993.06] offering up to him the needs of the world and of our church.
[3993.30 → 3994.60] So please pray with me.
[3995.00 → 3997.16] I'll begin with a reading from Isaiah.
[3999.86 → 4001.84] For to us a child is born.
[4001.84 → 4006.08] To us a son is given.
[4007.28 → 4009.22] The government will be on his shoulders,
[4009.86 → 4013.94] and he will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
[4014.70 → 4017.62] Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[4018.42 → 4022.08] Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.
[4022.64 → 4025.36] He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom,
[4026.16 → 4028.98] establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness
[4028.98 → 4032.08] from that time on and forever.
[4032.62 → 4036.22] The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[4038.36 → 4043.94] Dear Lord, in this season of Christmas, we give you thanks, Lord, for the gift of your son, Jesus Christ.
[4043.94 → 4051.14] We give you thanks for his birth, his work in this world,
[4051.14 → 4054.24] in his sacrifice for our sins,
[4054.24 → 4057.04] and his resurrection and victory.
[4058.00 → 4066.68] Help us, Lord, to live out this coming week in a way that reflects the life that you came to give us by your grace.
[4066.68 → 4070.84] Help us, Lord, to see the invisible,
[4071.32 → 4074.44] to hold in the present, Lord, your future promises.
[4075.54 → 4084.16] Lord, we pray for those who maybe have lost loved ones this past year or even in many years ago,
[4084.16 → 4089.24] but who are keenly and deeply missed during this time of year.
[4090.20 → 4096.74] We pray, Lord, as a church, may we surround those who are grieving and lonely, sick and needy with your love.
[4097.44 → 4100.80] Use us, Lord, as instruments to share your love and your grace,
[4101.24 → 4105.60] not, Lord, in our own strength and ability, but through your grace working within us.
[4106.48 → 4110.64] Lord, we pray for families that are fractured or experience conflict.
[4110.64 → 4113.40] Lord, open hearts to reconciliation.
[4114.46 → 4116.10] Bring healing, Lord, to hurt people.
[4117.50 → 4120.48] Lord, we pray for those who don't yet know Jesus
[4120.48 → 4126.32] and who may have heard the gospel in a new way or for the first time
[4126.32 → 4129.98] at a recent Christmas service, whether at our church or another church.
[4130.92 → 4135.02] Lord, we pray that the message of Christ's birth would be clear and lasting
[4135.02 → 4139.22] and that the seed that was planted would take root and bear fruit in faith.
[4139.22 → 4145.14] Help us, Lord, to continue investing in relationships with those who are seeking.
[4145.88 → 4149.16] Give us perseverance and boldness to share the good news of the gospel.
[4150.44 → 4153.60] Our Lord, you are the ruler of all creation.
[4154.52 → 4160.42] All things are in your hands, and you are working out your good purposes in this world through Jesus Christ.
[4161.04 → 4163.48] So, Lord, we offer up to you the needs of the world.
[4163.48 → 4168.68] We pray that where there is turmoil and loss of life, that you would bring peace.
[4169.96 → 4174.20] We pray where there is deep need, that you would bring abundance.
[4175.32 → 4178.94] We pray where there is darkness, you would bring light.
[4180.06 → 4185.44] Lord, we pray for all this morning who are hurting, who are dealing with injuries, diseases, and illnesses.
[4185.44 → 4191.96] Lord, we pray for your healing power, and we pray for the peace of Christ to rule in our hearts.
[4193.02 → 4196.88] Finally, Lord, we thank you for coming amongst us again.
[4197.78 → 4202.78] We who are blessed in so many ways, Lord, we long for the complete joy of your kingdom.
[4203.78 → 4207.48] We whose hearts are heavy seek the joy of your presence.
[4207.48 → 4212.98] Lord, we are your people, walking in darkness, yet seeking the light.
[4213.80 → 4215.74] And to you we say, come, Lord Jesus.
[4216.56 → 4218.42] In your name we pray. Amen.
[4220.30 → 4221.08] Let's stand.
[4222.12 → 4223.90] And we go out with the Lord's blessing.
[4224.24 → 4233.14] One quick announcement is that we will gather for a New Year's Day service on January 1st, which is Thursday.
[4233.34 → 4233.94] I think Thursday.
[4233.94 → 4239.26] So we'll gather to worship again, kind of as the first fruits of the year,
[4239.34 → 4244.98] as we gather to pray for God's blessing upon the year to come,
[4245.18 → 4249.40] as we also look back with Thanksgiving on the year that he has also led us through.
[4249.84 → 4252.38] So I invite you to hold out your hands to receive God's blessing.
[4253.02 → 4256.28] Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant,
[4256.88 → 4261.24] brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that great shepherd of the sheep,
[4261.24 → 4264.52] would he equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[4264.98 → 4268.80] And may he work in us what is pleasing in him through Jesus Christ,
[4268.90 → 4270.82] to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4271.36 → 4271.68] Amen.
[4272.68 → 4273.80] So remain standing.
[4273.94 → 4277.60] We'll sing one more song and then join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall.
[4277.60 → 4301.54] Praise God, who came in infant love,
[4301.54 → 4308.84] to bear our flesh and praise be stone,
[4308.84 → 4316.20] born in a lowly manger stone,
[4316.20 → 4324.36] the old children shall redeem us all.
[4324.36 → 4332.10] And as creation held its breath,
[4332.10 → 4339.44] the firstborn came in our defence,
[4339.44 → 4346.50] to stand before his Father's tongue,
[4347.50 → 4353.66] and through his blood of life's death's heart,
[4353.66 → 4355.66] to a son of God's death's heart.
[4355.66 → 4361.66] To a son of God is born today,
[4361.66 → 4369.66] Emmanuel in flesh dismayed,
[4369.66 → 4376.66] true words for all his people say,
[4376.66 → 4384.50] Rejoice, yet thanks and praise his name.
[4384.50 → 4388.82] Amen.
[4406.66 → 4408.66] Amen.
[4408.66 → 4409.64] Amen.
[4409.64 → 4410.06] Amen.
[4410.66 → 4418.60] A Jesus,
[4418.60 → 4420.60] a Jesus,
[4420.66 → 4422.66] a divine,
[4422.66 → 4424.98] a Jesus,
[4424.98 → 4454.96] Thank you.
[4454.98 → 4484.96] Thank you.
[4484.98 → 4514.96] Thank you.
