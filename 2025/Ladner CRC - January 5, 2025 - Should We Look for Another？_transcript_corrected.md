[0.00 → 13.48] Walk in Unbanks
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[300.00 → 302.00] Amen.
[330.00 → 332.00] Amen.
[332.00 → 334.00] Amen.
[334.00 → 336.00] Amen.
[336.00 → 337.00] Good morning.
[337.00 → 342.50] You know, Elaine and I couldn't be here on January 1st for the service here to welcome
[342.50 → 346.00] everyone personally, as I'm sure all of you did, but so we're here now.
[346.00 → 349.00] And so I welcome you as the first Sunday of the year.
[349.00 → 353.00] And it's good to be back together as a community again.
[353.00 → 357.00] I'm John Smith, and I will lead you through the beginning parts of this service.
[357.00 → 361.50] If you're listening in on the YouTube channel at home, that's accessible through the church
[361.50 → 362.50] website.
[362.50 → 365.50] But you know that because you're watching me now.
[365.50 → 367.50] But good morning to you.
[367.50 → 370.50] If you're a visitor here, welcome to you.
[370.50 → 375.50] And we won't have much chance to say more than good morning to you during the service, but
[375.50 → 381.50] after the service we have coffee and tea and fellowship in the hall behind.
[381.50 → 383.50] Please, please join us there.
[383.50 → 389.00] Pastor Jason True will be up here later, and he continues his sermon series called Preparing
[389.00 → 392.00] the Way, which is based on the work of John the Baptist.
[392.00 → 396.00] And today, should we look for another?
[396.00 → 404.00] A reminder to those 12 to 24 people who show up on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock for free
[404.00 → 407.00] coffee, it starts again this Thursday.
[407.00 → 412.50] And you don't have to produce an ID saying you're over 65 years old.
[412.50 → 417.50] You can be any age and show up on Thursday morning and have coffee for an hour.
[417.50 → 420.50] When we'd welcome you, we'd widen the table to make room for you.
[420.50 → 424.50] It starts again this Thursday.
[424.50 → 431.00] The offering today is in support of a fellow named, and his wife named Alex L.
[431.00 → 438.00] He's a friend of Pastor Jason, and there are words up here which explain that they're starting
[438.00 → 442.00] to fund a ministry in the Middle East.
[442.00 → 450.00] And Pastor Jason will go into greater detail just before the offering today.
[450.00 → 458.50] Our call to worship this morning is a responsive reading from Psalm 51.
[458.50 → 463.50] I'll begin, and you know where the double lines and the double arrows are.
[463.50 → 469.50] Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your prayers.
[469.50 → 473.50] You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[473.50 → 476.50] You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
[476.50 → 484.00] My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart.
[484.00 → 489.00] You, God, will not despise.
[489.00 → 495.00] Will you join me in an opening prayer of adoration?
[495.00 → 500.00] Eternal God, we come to you in prayer to glorify your name.
[500.00 → 504.00] We seek to worship you and draw closer to you.
[504.00 → 507.50] You are worthy of our praise.
[507.50 → 509.50] There is no one like you.
[509.50 → 513.50] We honour you because you are the one true living God.
[513.50 → 517.50] You created this world and every detail in it.
[517.50 → 521.50] You created us and put breath in our lungs.
[521.50 → 525.50] With our voices, we proclaim your name, Lord over all.
[525.50 → 532.00] We also give you thanks for your son, Jesus Christ, and for his ministry of teaching and healing.
[532.00 → 536.00] For showing us the way to a more faithful life.
[536.00 → 540.00] For providing us with a connection to you.
[540.00 → 545.00] And for the sure promise of eternal life available to all.
[545.00 → 548.00] In your great mercy, you provide us with all that we need.
[548.00 → 551.50] Indeed, thank you for your faithfulness that endures forever.
[551.50 → 554.50] You are our rock and our redeemer.
[554.50 → 558.50] Thank you, O God, for loving us.
[558.50 → 560.50] We return glory to you.
[560.50 → 562.50] Amen.
[562.50 → 573.00] The Lord's greeting comes from Isaiah 43 verses 1 to 3 where God is speaking through Isaiah.
[573.00 → 576.00] Do not fear for I have redeemed you.
[576.00 → 578.00] I have summoned you by name.
[578.00 → 579.00] You are mine.
[579.00 → 586.00] And then God says in a metaphorical manner, when you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
[586.00 → 589.50] And when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[589.50 → 592.50] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned.
[592.50 → 594.50] The flames will not set you ablaze.
[594.50 → 597.50] For I am the Lord your God.
[597.50 → 601.50] God's greeted us.
[601.50 → 604.50] Now it's your turn to stand, turn around, and greet those behind you.
[604.50 → 607.50] Before we sing some songs of praise.
[607.50 → 633.00] And then we sing some songs of praise.
[633.00 → 647.50] All right, let's sing together.
[647.50 → 655.50] And we recognize that the God of 2024 is with us as we enter 2025.
[655.50 → 661.50] The God who was our help in ages past is our hope in this year to come.
[661.50 → 681.50] Oh God, our hope in ages past, our hope for years to come.
[681.50 → 690.50] Our shelter from us to our request, and our return of hope.
[690.50 → 692.50] We sing some songs of praise.
[692.50 → 693.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[693.50 → 698.50] And the Lord our hope is with us to come.
[698.50 → 700.50] We sing some songs of praise.
[700.50 → 703.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[703.50 → 713.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[713.50 → 715.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[715.50 → 717.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[717.50 → 720.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[720.50 → 721.50] The God of 2024 is with us to come.
[721.50 → 728.50] All the nations who sing to me, all the world and all the world,
[728.50 → 736.80] all the shame that I am on you to be alone, all the world.
[736.80 → 744.50] You are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[744.50 → 751.50] You are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[759.50 → 768.50] O God, our only angels count, our hope for years to find.
[768.50 → 778.50] Our shelter from the storm in life and our eternal home.
[779.50 → 788.50] O God, our hope in ages past, our hope for years to die.
[788.50 → 798.50] We now are God, God, God, shall bless and our eternal home.
[798.50 → 805.50] O God, you are, you are our God.
[805.50 → 811.50] You are our power to all generations.
[811.50 → 816.50] You will be forever and ever.
[816.50 → 822.50] For a shame that I am on you to rule the law.
[822.50 → 832.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[832.50 → 833.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[833.50 → 834.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[834.50 → 835.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[835.50 → 836.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[836.50 → 837.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[837.50 → 838.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[838.50 → 842.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[842.50 → 843.50] O God, who are the nation of peace and worthy of our praise.
[843.50 → 850.48] Oh, my gracious, you will be forever and ever.
[850.48 → 858.48] I share, and I will be through the fall of love.
[859.16 → 865.48] You are a nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[867.22 → 873.48] You are a nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[873.50 → 881.56] Oh, my God, you are our help.
[882.04 → 887.54] You are our happy to all generations.
[888.08 → 891.50] You will be forever and ever.
[892.94 → 897.50] Oh, my God, you are our hope.
[897.50 → 903.28] Oh, my Lord, you are the nation of kings.
[903.50 → 915.56] You are a nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[915.56 → 923.56] You are a nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[923.56 → 925.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[925.56 → 927.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[927.56 → 929.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[929.56 → 931.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[931.56 → 933.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[933.56 → 937.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[937.56 → 949.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[949.56 → 951.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of our praise.
[951.56 → 956.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and worthy of our praise.
[956.56 → 959.56] Oh, my God, you are the nation of kings and glory of our praise.
[959.56 → 964.52] He will glorify the Lord of hosts,
[964.86 → 969.24] He is the great I am.
[969.78 → 973.66] Lord, Jehovah, Lord, in majesty,
[974.46 → 978.42] He will bow before His throne.
[979.10 → 982.96] He will worship Him in righteousness,
[983.66 → 987.66] He will worship Him in my hand.
[987.66 → 992.88] He will worship Him in my hand forever,
[993.56 → 997.46] He is Lord of all who live.
[998.22 → 1002.58] He is Lord of all who live,
[1002.96 → 1006.84] All who praise Him in the name.
[1007.64 → 1011.96] Hallelujah to the King of kings,
[1012.30 → 1015.96] Hallelujah to the Lamb,
[1015.96 → 1021.26] Hallelujah to the Lord of hosts,
[1021.58 → 1026.26] He will worship Him in my hand.
[1027.86 → 1028.96] Let me have a seat.
[1028.96 → 1044.42] Our scripture this morning comes from Isaiah 35.
[1045.52 → 1049.66] It'll be on the screen, but it's also on your pew Bible in page 535,
[1049.92 → 1051.90] if you choose to look at it that way.
[1052.54 → 1053.88] And I have it in my script here.
[1053.94 → 1055.52] I'll see if I can read it from the back.
[1055.52 → 1057.52] Isaiah 35.
[1059.14 → 1062.38] The desert and the parched land will be glad.
[1063.30 → 1065.52] The wilderness will rejoice and blossom.
[1066.32 → 1068.64] Like the crocus, it will burst into bloom.
[1068.82 → 1071.50] It will rejoice greatly and shout for joy.
[1072.22 → 1074.68] The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
[1074.68 → 1076.86] the splendour of Carmel and Sharon.
[1077.30 → 1079.46] They will see the glory of the Lord,
[1079.66 → 1081.44] the splendour of our God.
[1083.14 → 1084.54] Strengthen the feeble hands,
[1084.78 → 1086.52] steady the knees that give way.
[1087.10 → 1089.02] Say to those with fearful hearts,
[1089.14 → 1091.26] be strong, do not fear,
[1091.72 → 1092.84] your God will come.
[1093.26 → 1094.74] And He will come with vengeance,
[1095.16 → 1096.52] with divine retribution.
[1096.82 → 1098.26] He will come to save you.
[1098.26 → 1101.22] Then will the eyes of the blind be opened
[1101.22 → 1104.52] and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
[1105.38 → 1107.82] Then will the lame leap like a deer
[1107.82 → 1110.54] and the mute tongue shout for joy.
[1111.34 → 1113.24] Water will gush forth in the wilderness
[1113.24 → 1115.10] and streams in the desert.
[1115.74 → 1118.10] The burning sand will become a pool.
[1118.46 → 1120.94] The thirsty ground bubbling springs.
[1121.68 → 1124.26] In the haunts where jackals once lay,
[1124.26 → 1127.36] grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
[1128.26 → 1130.56] And a highway will be there.
[1130.80 → 1133.64] It will be called the way of holiness.
[1134.02 → 1138.18] It will be there for those who walk on that way.
[1138.42 → 1140.26] The unclean will not journey on it.
[1140.64 → 1142.94] Wicked fools will not go about on it.
[1143.96 → 1145.44] No lion will be there,
[1145.78 → 1147.20] nor any ravenous beast.
[1147.88 → 1149.34] They will not be found there,
[1149.80 → 1152.08] but only the redeemed will walk there.
[1152.08 → 1156.02] And those the Lord has rescued will return.
[1156.02 → 1158.18] They will enter Zion with singing.
[1158.76 → 1161.14] Everlasting joy will crown their heads.
[1161.90 → 1164.12] Gladness and joy will overtake them.
[1164.76 → 1167.74] And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
[1169.48 → 1171.00] This is the word of the Lord.
[1171.56 → 1172.68] Thank you, God.
[1172.68 → 1178.54] This time of our church service,
[1178.68 → 1182.40] we have a time of confession and assurance.
[1183.94 → 1189.56] Today, rather than confession being a time of addressing our shortcomings,
[1190.22 → 1195.44] I point out that confession can also be a stating of what we believe.
[1195.44 → 1200.68] In a past church service or two,
[1200.90 → 1204.32] I have used this time to review the Ten Commandments.
[1204.72 → 1207.88] Today, on this first Sunday of the year,
[1208.98 → 1210.38] and for the sake of some brevity,
[1210.90 → 1212.80] we will just look at one of them.
[1212.80 → 1219.16] You know, it would be quite normal for most of us to say,
[1219.76 → 1221.12] our Father in heaven,
[1221.76 → 1222.94] he is our God.
[1223.58 → 1224.98] I think you can agree with that.
[1225.76 → 1227.12] But sometimes English,
[1227.44 → 1230.56] or indeed language in general from humans,
[1230.80 → 1232.18] can fail us in some way.
[1233.56 → 1234.08] Father?
[1236.72 → 1238.06] Well, God is not human,
[1238.06 → 1242.56] so he is not really male or female,
[1243.62 → 1247.62] though he does have the characteristics of good fathers and mothers,
[1248.64 → 1250.70] or perhaps you can think of that as
[1250.70 → 1253.40] they have good characteristics of him.
[1257.22 → 1258.14] And of course,
[1258.30 → 1262.90] some portion of God was imparted to or present in Jesus Christ.
[1262.90 → 1264.74] So then,
[1264.88 → 1266.46] what do you call God
[1266.46 → 1268.36] who is not male or female?
[1269.78 → 1271.44] Maybe Father comes closest.
[1272.96 → 1274.18] Limitations of language.
[1275.64 → 1276.38] Our God?
[1277.76 → 1278.32] Well,
[1278.42 → 1279.92] that implies in some ways,
[1280.04 → 1280.22] well,
[1280.74 → 1281.54] he is our God,
[1282.74 → 1283.88] as distinguished from
[1283.88 → 1285.28] your God.
[1287.32 → 1287.48] Hmm.
[1288.90 → 1289.98] When Elaine and I were
[1289.98 → 1292.40] visiting in Istanbul some years ago,
[1292.40 → 1294.42] the God of the locals was Allah.
[1295.70 → 1297.42] And five times a day,
[1298.04 → 1300.78] somebody shouted for prayers
[1300.78 → 1302.14] from some speaker somewhere,
[1302.46 → 1303.96] and it was loud,
[1304.18 → 1305.26] and the one at sunrise
[1305.26 → 1307.08] was difficult on our ears
[1307.08 → 1308.36] after a long plane ride
[1308.36 → 1309.66] the night before.
[1310.86 → 1312.48] On the way to church this morning,
[1312.60 → 1313.98] we go by a temple
[1313.98 → 1316.46] which is crowded with cars in the street,
[1316.58 → 1318.66] and there God is Buddha.
[1318.66 → 1322.60] I don't have to go through
[1322.60 → 1323.64] the thousands of other gods.
[1324.58 → 1325.20] Now then,
[1325.30 → 1327.16] we live in a multicultural society,
[1327.16 → 1328.72] and we run daily into people
[1328.72 → 1329.68] with beliefs
[1329.68 → 1331.46] that are not ours,
[1331.54 → 1333.80] and they believe in other gods.
[1334.00 → 1335.56] And we are bound to treat them
[1335.56 → 1337.02] with respect and courtesy.
[1337.96 → 1339.10] We don't curse them
[1339.10 → 1341.48] for a lack of belief in our God.
[1341.48 → 1345.78] But I suppose in some ways
[1345.78 → 1346.56] that was true
[1346.56 → 1347.72] of the Israelites in Egypt.
[1348.10 → 1348.66] After all,
[1348.70 → 1349.08] they had been there
[1349.08 → 1350.54] for 400 years
[1350.54 → 1353.16] amongst a list of,
[1353.16 → 1354.88] a litany of other gods.
[1357.58 → 1359.14] That recalls the tale
[1359.14 → 1360.62] of Moses and the burning bush
[1360.62 → 1362.20] where Moses said,
[1362.28 → 1363.18] I will go over and see
[1363.18 → 1364.88] why this bush does not burn up.
[1364.92 → 1365.80] And when he got there,
[1365.92 → 1367.22] God began to speak to him.
[1367.78 → 1368.28] God said,
[1368.28 → 1369.52] go to the Israelites
[1369.52 → 1371.70] and then to Pharaoh saying,
[1372.16 → 1372.84] God says,
[1372.96 → 1374.18] let my people go.
[1376.52 → 1378.16] In Exodus 3.13,
[1378.30 → 1379.14] Moses said to God,
[1379.50 → 1381.32] suppose I go to the Israelites
[1381.32 → 1382.14] and say to them,
[1382.24 → 1383.16] the God of your fathers
[1383.16 → 1384.50] has sent me to you,
[1384.62 → 1385.58] and they ask me,
[1385.76 → 1386.72] what is his name?
[1389.10 → 1390.54] Then what shall I tell them?
[1390.92 → 1391.62] God replied,
[1392.28 → 1394.34] I am who I am.
[1395.40 → 1395.78] Adding,
[1396.18 → 1397.66] say this to the people of Israel,
[1397.66 → 1400.60] I am has sent me to you.
[1402.96 → 1404.32] Although there is some debate,
[1405.00 → 1406.78] most scholars analyzing
[1406.78 → 1407.54] the Hebrew text
[1407.54 → 1409.12] believe that best translates
[1409.12 → 1411.30] to God's oneness
[1411.30 → 1413.48] and his eternal nature.
[1415.40 → 1416.58] And this was reinforced
[1416.58 → 1419.48] by John the Apostle's visions
[1419.48 → 1421.52] recorded in Revelation 1, verse 8.
[1421.82 → 1423.74] I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[1423.94 → 1424.90] says the Lord God,
[1424.90 → 1425.60] who is
[1425.60 → 1427.08] and who was
[1427.08 → 1428.92] and who is to come,
[1429.30 → 1429.90] the Almighty.
[1431.66 → 1432.62] So that leads me
[1432.62 → 1433.90] to the one commandment
[1433.90 → 1434.36] of the ten
[1434.36 → 1435.52] that we will cover this morning.
[1436.58 → 1437.76] And Doug will put it up
[1437.76 → 1438.34] on the screen.
[1438.34 → 1445.04] Can you read with me?
[1445.04 → 1446.18] Commandment number one.
[1447.38 → 1448.26] You shall have
[1448.26 → 1449.34] no other gods
[1449.34 → 1450.12] before me.
[1451.16 → 1452.22] And the subtext is,
[1452.42 → 1453.00] do not worship
[1453.00 → 1453.84] any other god
[1453.84 → 1455.16] than the one true god.
[1455.28 → 1456.22] All others
[1456.22 → 1457.38] are false gods.
[1458.08 → 1458.32] Worship
[1458.32 → 1460.24] this true god
[1460.24 → 1461.14] alone.
[1461.14 → 1464.22] So there we are.
[1464.34 → 1465.10] In our tolerance
[1465.10 → 1466.36] of those with other beliefs,
[1467.58 → 1468.56] let's always remember
[1468.56 → 1469.64] the simple reality
[1469.64 → 1471.48] of the first commandment.
[1473.52 → 1474.58] Words of assurance
[1474.58 → 1475.76] that are from God
[1475.76 → 1476.96] can be extrapolated
[1476.96 → 1478.66] from Jeremiah 7,
[1478.78 → 1480.30] verses 22 and beyond.
[1480.80 → 1481.60] For when I brought
[1481.60 → 1483.02] your ancestors
[1483.02 → 1483.90] out of Egypt
[1483.90 → 1485.06] and spoke to them,
[1485.14 → 1486.22] I did not just
[1486.22 → 1487.22] give them commands
[1487.22 → 1488.44] about burnt offerings
[1488.44 → 1489.18] and sacrifice,
[1489.18 → 1490.44] but I gave them
[1490.44 → 1491.34] this command,
[1492.02 → 1493.00] obey me
[1493.00 → 1495.34] and I will be your God
[1495.34 → 1497.50] and you will be my people.
[1499.48 → 1500.50] Because of Jesus'
[1500.70 → 1501.64] life and sacrifice,
[1501.80 → 1502.50] we here
[1502.50 → 1503.40] can enjoy
[1503.40 → 1504.42] that same promise.
[1505.20 → 1506.02] And that's the assurance
[1506.02 → 1506.82] we have this morning
[1506.82 → 1508.12] and those assurances
[1508.12 → 1508.62] are covered
[1508.62 → 1509.80] in the next two songs
[1509.80 → 1510.56] beginning with
[1510.56 → 1511.72] the goodness of God.
[1511.72 → 1540.02] I love you, Lord.
[1540.02 → 1549.06] of heaven.
[1549.06 → 1569.82] I will sing of the goodness of all
[1569.82 → 1576.78] All my life you have been faithful
[1576.78 → 1586.06] All my life you have been so, so good
[1586.06 → 1592.56] With every path that I have made for
[1592.56 → 1600.24] I will sing of the goodness of all
[1600.24 → 1603.94] I love your voice
[1603.94 → 1608.84] And I'm glad that you're the Father
[1608.84 → 1612.64] In darkness, light
[1612.64 → 1616.52] In my voice, light, water
[1616.52 → 1620.72] I know you as a father
[1620.72 → 1625.10] I know you as a friend
[1625.10 → 1634.22] Lord, my grace, I know you as a mega
[1634.22 → 1634.60] God said, I know you as a protector
[1634.60 → 1635.50] And I know you as a protector
[1635.50 → 1640.12] All my life you have been faithful
[1640.12 → 1647.76] All my life you have been so, so good
[1647.76 → 1655.36] I know every word that I have made for
[1655.36 → 1663.06] I understand the goodness of God
[1663.06 → 1671.76] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1671.76 → 1678.76] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1678.76 → 1685.96] With all I've been done, I've spent your life, I give you everything
[1685.96 → 1693.96] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1693.96 → 1701.96] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1701.96 → 1708.96] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1708.96 → 1715.96] With all I've been done, I've spent your life, I give you everything
[1715.96 → 1723.96] Your goodness is running out, it's running out for me
[1723.96 → 1735.96] All my life you have been faithful
[1735.96 → 1743.96] All my life you have been faithful
[1743.96 → 1745.96] So good
[1745.96 → 1750.96] Every breath that I have made for
[1750.96 → 1758.96] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1758.96 → 1766.96] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1766.96 → 1768.96] Lord, you are the shepherd
[1768.96 → 1772.96] We will like the Lord
[1772.96 → 1778.96] For you take us to the past
[1778.96 → 1780.96] Jesus Christ
[1780.96 → 1782.96] Lord, you are the shepherd
[1782.96 → 1786.96] We will like for no good thing
[1786.96 → 1788.96] For you take us to the past
[1788.96 → 1790.96] Jesus Christ
[1790.96 → 1792.96] Lord, you are the shepherd
[1792.96 → 1794.96] We will like for no good thing
[1794.96 → 1802.96] For you take us to the past
[1802.96 → 1804.96] Jesus Christ
[1804.96 → 1806.96] Lord, you are the shepherd
[1806.96 → 1808.96] You leave me sighs till waters
[1808.96 → 1810.96] Bring me fresh into our souls
[1810.96 → 1812.96] As you guide us in the past
[1812.96 → 1814.96] And make us free
[1814.96 → 1816.96] Beyond
[1816.96 → 1818.96] Beyond
[1818.96 → 1826.96] Beyond
[1826.96 → 1828.96] Beyond
[1828.96 → 1830.96] Beyond
[1830.96 → 1838.96] Though we walk through this dark cloud
[1838.96 → 1842.96] We will feel our little faith
[1842.96 → 1844.96] You bring comfort in the past
[1844.96 → 1846.96] Now part in the presence
[1846.96 → 1850.96] Of our souls
[1850.96 → 1854.96] You anoint our heads with oil
[1854.96 → 1858.96] And peace and mercy of the stem
[1858.96 → 1864.96] As we dwell in the house forevermore
[1864.96 → 1866.96] Beyond
[1866.96 → 1870.96] Beyond
[1870.96 → 1872.96] We will feel our TOI
[1872.96 → 1886.96] Be in awe
[1886.96 → 1888.96] Lord, you are our shepherd
[1888.96 → 1890.96] We will like for no good thing
[1890.96 → 1892.96] For you take us to the past
[1892.96 → 1894.96] You're there for thee
[1894.96 → 1896.96] You leave me sighs till waters
[1896.96 → 1902.40] This sun is still a while, it's a deep, refreshing to our souls.
[1902.40 → 1909.22] As you guide us in the path that makes us free.
[1910.24 → 1912.10] We are.
[1916.54 → 1918.48] We are.
[1918.48 → 1920.48] We are.
[1925.48 → 1932.16] Though we walk through the dark night, we will fear the evil things.
[1932.16 → 1938.16] You bring comfort in the presence of our God.
[1940.12 → 1946.16] You invite our heads with one, kiss and mercy on us now.
[1946.16 → 1953.16] And we dwell in your eyes forevermore.
[1954.60 → 1957.16] Be gone.
[1960.16 → 1963.16] Be gone.
[1967.16 → 1971.16] Be gone.
[1971.16 → 1978.16] Be gone.
[1978.16 → 1979.60] Be gone.
[1979.60 → 1985.16] Be gone.
[1985.16 → 1986.16] Be gone.
[1986.16 → 1990.16] Be gone.
[1990.16 → 1991.16] Be gone.
[1991.16 → 1992.16] Be gone.
[1992.16 → 1993.16] Be gone.
[1993.16 → 1994.16] Be gone.
[1994.16 → 1995.16] Be gone.
[1995.16 → 1996.16] Be gone.
[1998.60 → 1999.16] Thank you, baby.
[1999.16 → 2000.12] Be gone.
[2000.12 → 2000.82] Be gone.
[2006.82 → 2007.60] All right.
[2007.60 → 2013.16] The children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[2013.16 → 2017.16] dismissed to go to their Sunday School classes.
[2027.40 → 2035.84] So good morning to you all. It's good to be with you today. As John mentioned, I
[2035.84 → 2041.10] have a little echo going on here. Do you hear it? Okay. As John mentioned earlier,
[2041.10 → 2046.38] we're going to continue in our sermon series that we're calling Preparing the Way,
[2047.26 → 2053.04] looking at the life of John the Baptist. It's a series we started in Advent, but as we've gone,
[2053.14 → 2059.24] I've discovered there are more passages that I think are really fascinating and really helpful for us.
[2059.64 → 2066.24] And so this week and next week, we'll continue on a bit longer in the Gospel of Luke before we resume
[2066.24 → 2072.24] our study in Romans later on. So please open your Bibles to Luke if you'd like to follow along in
[2072.24 → 2089.26] your pew Bible. We're in Luke chapter 7. It's on page 768, 768 in your pew Bible. So we'll be in Luke
[2089.26 → 2100.26] chapter 7, reading verses 18 to 30. Let's give our attention to the reading of God's Word.
[2102.02 → 2109.22] John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, he sent them to the Lord to
[2109.22 → 2117.76] ask, are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else? When the men came to Jesus,
[2117.76 → 2125.60] they said, John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, are you the one who was to come, or should we expect
[2125.60 → 2133.76] someone else? At that very time, Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits and
[2133.76 → 2141.16] gave sight to many who were blind. So he replied to the messengers, go back and report to John what you
[2141.16 → 2148.40] have seen and heard. The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured,
[2149.08 → 2155.20] the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed is the man who
[2155.20 → 2161.90] does not fall away on account of me. After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd
[2161.90 → 2169.78] about John. What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? If not, what did
[2169.78 → 2176.68] you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in
[2176.68 → 2184.06] luxury are in palaces. But what did you go out to see? A prophet. Yes, I tell you, and more than a
[2184.06 → 2190.46] prophet, this is the one about whom it is written, I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare
[2190.46 → 2195.44] your way before you. I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John,
[2196.04 → 2201.66] yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. All the people, even the tax
[2201.66 → 2207.44] collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they
[2207.44 → 2212.72] had been baptized by John. But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for
[2212.72 → 2219.74] themselves, because they had not been baptized by John. This is the word of the Lord.
[2222.14 → 2227.46] Would you please join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon the reading and preaching of
[2227.46 → 2236.18] his word? Let's pray together. Gracious Father, I pray that your Holy Spirit will open your word now to
[2236.18 → 2244.92] our hearts and open our hearts to your word, that we may believe and receive the things that belong
[2244.92 → 2251.88] to our peace and to our joy. Through Christ our Lord, we pray and ask. Amen.
[2254.18 → 2263.14] We've been looking at the life of John the Baptist, and John's sole job was to be a human signpost.
[2263.14 → 2271.54] His job was to point the way to the one who is now coming, the Messiah. So when John was in the
[2271.54 → 2282.06] wilderness baptizing people, one day Jesus came. And when John saw Jesus, he pointed to Jesus and said,
[2282.80 → 2291.30] Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. You know, imagine if you had a million
[2291.30 → 2299.38] followers on Instagram or on social media, whatever you use, and one day you told all of your followers,
[2299.70 → 2307.86] and you're quite influential, you said, Hey everyone, stop following me and follow somebody else instead.
[2308.82 → 2315.64] Right? He is far better than me in every way. Stop following me, just go follow him.
[2315.64 → 2325.08] That's essentially what John did. Right? Why? Because John knows who Jesus is. He knows he is the one
[2325.08 → 2331.06] that we've been waiting for. The one who would be sent by God to be our rescuer, who would come to
[2331.06 → 2338.48] repair all that is broken in our world. And John had said so clearly, I am not the Messiah.
[2338.48 → 2352.50] He must become greater. I must become less. But now, and this may surprise you, even John,
[2353.40 → 2360.70] even John the Baptist had some questions about who Jesus really is.
[2360.70 → 2370.28] And I wonder if he doesn't ask a question here in Luke chapter 7 that we all ask. In some form,
[2370.82 → 2383.70] sometimes, Jesus, are you the one? I mean, really, are you the one? And how can we know?
[2383.70 → 2392.18] That's what John is asking. And I think that's what a lot of us are asking, have asked, will ask.
[2393.64 → 2403.42] Right? Until now, John has only championed Jesus. He has supported Jesus and honoured Jesus with
[2403.42 → 2409.24] absolute clarity, with absolute conviction. He has given no sign of any sort of doubts,
[2409.24 → 2417.84] any sort of internal conflict about who Jesus might be. But now, his question, it seems like
[2417.84 → 2423.44] a disheartened question, doesn't it? Look with me at verses 18 and 19.
[2425.14 → 2432.72] The gospel writer Luke says, John's disciples told him about all of these things that Jesus was doing,
[2433.42 → 2438.06] calling two of them. He sent them to the Lord to ask, are you the one who is to come?
[2438.06 → 2446.98] Or should we expect someone else? Jesus, are you the one? I mean, are you really?
[2448.92 → 2454.82] And it's significant that John sends two of his disciples back to ask Jesus this question,
[2455.46 → 2462.16] right? Because based on the book of Deuteronomy, you need two witnesses to have a binding legal answer.
[2462.16 → 2468.48] In a sense, it seems as though John wants Jesus to take the stand and testify.
[2471.08 → 2484.44] But here's the question, why now? Right? Why does John begin to wonder who Jesus really is now, not earlier?
[2484.44 → 2493.34] Well, likely he's wondering for the same reason. Lots of people across time have wondered that same thing, right?
[2493.40 → 2497.80] People who thought they knew Jesus, but maybe who aren't so sure anymore.
[2498.68 → 2503.28] And the reason is here, circumstances, right?
[2503.36 → 2506.54] John's circumstances have become really bad.
[2506.54 → 2516.02] He's in prison. He's been arrested for speaking out against Herod and saying, hey, you shouldn't marry your brother's wife.
[2517.30 → 2519.42] Okay, that got him in a lot of trouble.
[2519.42 → 2527.28] So I want to show you this photo on the trip to Israel and Jordan that I went on a few years ago.
[2527.68 → 2532.00] We visited Herod's palace fortress called Marius.
[2532.84 → 2534.90] And this is where John was imprisoned.
[2535.40 → 2538.86] Now, the fortress is not there anymore, but it was right on top of that hill.
[2538.90 → 2541.36] And we walked up the hill, and you can see some of the ruins.
[2541.44 → 2545.34] There's like one little pillar and there are some other ruins up there.
[2545.34 → 2550.88] And so you can imagine, though, a magnificent palace building up there.
[2551.84 → 2554.98] That would have been, you know, the best that could have been had in the land.
[2555.06 → 2559.64] And it was actually located east of the Jordan in the area where John was ministering.
[2561.24 → 2567.22] But we also went up the mountain, and we went into some of the caves that were on the side of the mountain.
[2567.22 → 2576.10] And so here's a photo of inside one of the caves below the palace, which were used as jail cells.
[2576.22 → 2581.52] And so there's Pastor Grant reenacting John the Baptist, you know, being chained to the wall.
[2581.72 → 2584.04] And so this is a man-made wall in the cave.
[2584.26 → 2589.60] And you can see there's these square holes that are in the wall.
[2589.60 → 2593.66] And it almost seems as if maybe that's where chains were fastened.
[2593.94 → 2597.14] And so, you know, we don't know if that was the exact cell.
[2597.32 → 2603.94] But likely we know from ancient sources, just Josephus, that John was in prison at Mercuries.
[2604.56 → 2606.80] And that maybe he was in a cell just like that.
[2608.32 → 2612.64] And so John's life hangs by a thread.
[2614.12 → 2616.86] And when you're in a prison, what are you thinking about?
[2616.86 → 2619.60] Especially if you're in Herod's prison.
[2620.26 → 2622.08] You're thinking about, how can I get out?
[2623.40 → 2630.10] And while in prison, John's disciples come, and they report to John how Jesus is progressing as the Messiah.
[2631.36 → 2636.42] Most likely, they told John about recent events that we read about in Luke 7.
[2636.62 → 2640.38] How Jesus had miraculously healed the centurion's servant.
[2640.98 → 2644.20] How he had raised a widow's son from the dead.
[2646.86 → 2649.96] But this is of little comfort to John.
[2652.52 → 2658.98] You know, but we shouldn't be surprised, though, that someone who knew, who believed that Jesus was the Messiah might wonder,
[2659.42 → 2660.26] did I get it wrong?
[2661.46 → 2661.68] Right?
[2661.72 → 2663.46] Because there are expectations.
[2664.80 → 2668.36] You know, everyone had expectations for whom the Messiah would be.
[2668.80 → 2669.50] Remember Peter?
[2669.50 → 2675.30] Peter gets thrown off by his expectations of Jesus.
[2675.30 → 2681.26] Peter says to Jesus, you are the Messiah, the son of the living God.
[2682.08 → 2685.04] And then Jesus says, yes, and I'm about to go and die.
[2685.84 → 2687.90] And Peter's like, no, no, no, no.
[2688.16 → 2688.98] No, Jesus.
[2689.22 → 2689.94] God forbid.
[2690.56 → 2692.30] That doesn't happen to the Messiah.
[2693.30 → 2695.90] The Messiah is supposed to overthrow the Romans.
[2696.10 → 2698.76] He is supposed to establish the new Davidic kingdom.
[2698.76 → 2703.20] Jesus, I just confess that I thought you were the Messiah.
[2704.16 → 2705.28] Did I get it wrong?
[2706.92 → 2709.80] And it seems like John is maybe having one of those Peter moments.
[2710.96 → 2712.88] Jesus, I'm still here in prison.
[2714.88 → 2716.32] Why am I still here?
[2717.44 → 2719.08] Did I get it wrong?
[2719.08 → 2723.30] Have you ever wondered something similar?
[2724.88 → 2732.30] Jesus, if you are who you say you are, please notice that I'm still waiting.
[2734.76 → 2734.96] Right?
[2735.02 → 2737.88] Please notice, Jesus, that I'm still in pain.
[2739.60 → 2741.84] That I still have unmet hopes.
[2743.10 → 2743.50] Right?
[2743.60 → 2746.72] That the things in my life aren't turning out the way I thought they would.
[2746.72 → 2752.66] You know, Jesus, my whole life feels to be uphill against the wind.
[2754.02 → 2756.52] And I'm finding it harder and harder to believe.
[2757.64 → 2759.44] Jesus, they say you're the one.
[2760.20 → 2760.88] But are you?
[2762.34 → 2762.58] Right?
[2762.66 → 2767.58] John is asking a question that has been asked and is being asked by countless others.
[2768.76 → 2771.98] And he's asking a question that some of us are asking right now.
[2772.70 → 2775.74] In light of all that is broken in my life and in the world,
[2775.74 → 2783.86] how can I know, Jesus, that you are the God who is to come to repair our world?
[2785.48 → 2788.86] And so I have two things for us to consider as we look at this passage
[2788.86 → 2795.08] in order to kind of, you know, wrestle with this question that John asked and that we ask.
[2795.36 → 2800.14] The first thing we're going to look at is just further into John's question that he raises.
[2800.72 → 2802.64] And then we're going to look at Jesus' response.
[2803.42 → 2805.14] Okay, John's question, Jesus' response.
[2805.14 → 2805.66] It's very simple.
[2806.12 → 2812.94] So let's look first at the question that John asks his disciples or sends his disciples to ask Jesus.
[2813.30 → 2814.68] So let's look at verse 20.
[2816.88 → 2819.62] When the men came to Jesus, they said,
[2819.98 → 2821.84] John the Baptist sent us to ask you,
[2822.02 → 2825.72] are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?
[2825.72 → 2829.46] So let's look at this question in two parts.
[2829.46 → 2830.90] There's kind of two questions.
[2831.48 → 2835.94] The first part, John asks, are you the one who is to come?
[2837.32 → 2845.00] He wants to know if Jesus is, in fact, who the ancient Hebrews called the Messiah.
[2846.16 → 2846.38] Right?
[2846.46 → 2847.44] The anointed one.
[2847.50 → 2848.96] In Greek, the Christ.
[2848.96 → 2852.70] God himself come to us.
[2853.48 → 2857.74] He wants to know if Jesus really is he.
[2859.12 → 2860.76] But why that question?
[2861.56 → 2862.28] Why that question?
[2862.28 → 2866.72] Why not instead ask, Jesus, are you going to get me out of here?
[2867.72 → 2870.88] That might have been a reasonable question, an understandable question.
[2871.78 → 2877.60] Isaiah 61 even says the Messiah would proclaim liberty to the captives,
[2878.08 → 2880.74] the opening of the prison to those who are bound.
[2881.72 → 2882.80] Okay, there's an expectation.
[2882.80 → 2885.46] But that's not what John asks.
[2886.48 → 2891.68] At this moment, John has put aside the questions about his own circumstances,
[2892.14 → 2894.32] not because he's forgotten he's in prison,
[2894.78 → 2899.02] but because there is a bigger question, there is a more vital question
[2899.02 → 2905.00] that will make any other questions insignificant in comparison.
[2906.12 → 2908.54] John needs to know if Jesus is truly the one.
[2908.54 → 2913.12] Because that will determine how he views his situation,
[2913.70 → 2916.30] how he views himself, how he views everything.
[2917.64 → 2921.58] He's not going to try to make sense of what he's going through
[2921.58 → 2923.76] until he knows who Jesus is.
[2924.78 → 2931.86] So notice that John's not making his circumstances the measure of who Jesus is.
[2932.74 → 2936.48] No, he's not saying, Jesus, you can't be the one because I'm here.
[2936.48 → 2941.64] Or, Jesus, you can't be the one because I'm going through something difficult.
[2943.12 → 2943.34] Right?
[2943.42 → 2947.72] John wants to know who Jesus is because that's going to determine everything else.
[2948.76 → 2953.56] If Jesus is the one who came to set us free from sin and from death,
[2954.42 → 2955.34] then what's prison?
[2956.34 → 2956.52] Right?
[2956.58 → 2959.72] If Jesus is the one, then whatever Jesus you ask
[2959.72 → 2965.66] is a tiny thing compared to what I will receive.
[2966.48 → 2974.08] If you're the one Jesus, I can face any difficult circumstances and still be okay.
[2974.08 → 2979.84] So the first takeaway for us this morning is
[2979.84 → 2986.54] what lens will you look through to see Jesus?
[2987.16 → 2991.58] Are you going to look through the lens of your life to understand who Jesus is?
[2992.28 → 2996.92] Or are you going to look through the lens of who Jesus is
[2996.92 → 2999.60] to then look, understand your life?
[2999.60 → 3000.20] Right?
[3001.14 → 3006.30] Because if Jesus is God who came to show me his love and to rescue me,
[3006.42 → 3007.58] then I can trust him.
[3007.78 → 3009.14] I can trust him no matter what.
[3010.10 → 3011.44] If that's who he is.
[3013.30 → 3015.96] So now let's consider the second question for this morning.
[3017.32 → 3020.44] Or should we expect someone else?
[3020.44 → 3023.30] Now why does he ask that?
[3024.22 → 3031.14] Well, I think it's because John knows what happens if Jesus is not the one
[3031.14 → 3034.22] or if we reject Jesus as the one.
[3035.08 → 3038.40] He knows that we will look for someone else.
[3039.16 → 3041.06] Because there are only two options.
[3041.60 → 3044.78] You find the one, or you keep looking.
[3045.40 → 3047.26] You find the one, or you keep looking.
[3047.26 → 3047.94] Right?
[3048.14 → 3050.64] And so notice what John does not ask.
[3050.76 → 3054.22] He doesn't say, are you the one, or should I stop looking?
[3055.62 → 3056.18] Right?
[3056.26 → 3058.66] He says, or should we expect someone else?
[3059.54 → 3059.94] Why?
[3061.30 → 3065.38] Because if Jesus is not the one or if we reject Jesus as the one,
[3065.62 → 3067.36] we will not stop looking.
[3068.26 → 3068.40] Right?
[3068.44 → 3071.96] There is no stopping looking for the one.
[3072.88 → 3074.38] We will always look.
[3074.50 → 3075.54] We will always search.
[3075.54 → 3077.18] Right?
[3077.26 → 3079.00] We will always look for that one thing,
[3079.62 → 3082.46] the one person who can come into my life,
[3082.56 → 3085.82] who will allow me to face any circumstance.
[3086.58 → 3087.68] Even the worst ones.
[3087.72 → 3090.32] Where we can say, because I have this,
[3090.70 → 3094.74] I can be not okay and still be okay.
[3096.82 → 3098.82] St. Augustine famously said,
[3099.48 → 3101.42] you have made us for yourself.
[3101.62 → 3102.26] In the next slide.
[3102.26 → 3105.78] You have made us for yourself, O Lord,
[3106.54 → 3112.10] and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you.
[3114.18 → 3114.66] Right?
[3114.94 → 3118.30] Your heart is always seeking this.
[3119.12 → 3120.40] Is always seeking this.
[3120.48 → 3123.44] The thing or person that you can look to and say,
[3123.64 → 3124.20] I'm home.
[3124.20 → 3126.30] I'm at rest.
[3126.42 → 3126.88] I'm okay.
[3128.38 → 3129.82] And it could be lots of things, right?
[3130.42 → 3131.64] You know, it could be your family.
[3131.88 → 3132.64] That's a good thing.
[3133.38 → 3135.44] As long as I have my family, I'll be okay.
[3136.76 → 3139.26] I remember when Christi and I were first engaged,
[3139.36 → 3141.66] and we were talking about the future,
[3142.04 → 3144.28] and what, you know, God might have in store for us.
[3144.28 → 3145.82] And I remember saying,
[3146.56 → 3148.84] I will go anywhere God calls me to go.
[3148.94 → 3149.98] Anywhere in the world,
[3150.36 → 3151.92] as long as you are with me.
[3153.00 → 3154.56] I know, very romantic.
[3155.00 → 3157.32] I didn't hear too many AHS, but okay, you know.
[3159.00 → 3159.82] Thank you.
[3162.36 → 3165.76] But what is your as long as?
[3168.22 → 3171.12] Isn't that what we're really trusting in?
[3171.12 → 3174.48] And so it could be,
[3174.66 → 3176.36] whatever I face, I'll be okay,
[3176.48 → 3178.32] as long as my bank account's okay.
[3179.64 → 3180.00] Right?
[3180.06 → 3181.28] Or as long as, you know,
[3181.32 → 3182.26] I have this education,
[3182.44 → 3183.18] or I have children,
[3183.38 → 3184.68] or I have this career,
[3184.92 → 3186.34] or I live in the place I want to live.
[3186.38 → 3186.68] Anything.
[3187.90 → 3189.90] It could even be a vague sense that,
[3190.02 → 3190.82] in the end,
[3190.96 → 3192.88] surely if there is any justice in the world,
[3193.24 → 3194.00] I will be okay.
[3194.92 → 3196.28] That's what you can put your trust in.
[3198.54 → 3199.86] Something or someone
[3199.86 → 3202.50] is going to have to be Jesus in your life,
[3202.90 → 3204.48] is another way to say it.
[3206.48 → 3207.86] But here's the question.
[3208.40 → 3210.24] Will it be like him?
[3211.92 → 3215.46] Will it be as forgiving as he is?
[3216.40 → 3218.86] Will it be as gracious as he is?
[3219.40 → 3221.86] Will it be as strong and mighty
[3221.86 → 3223.48] and as lowly?
[3223.48 → 3226.34] Will it invite you to rest?
[3226.62 → 3229.96] Or will it keep you striving?
[3231.94 → 3233.78] There are only two options.
[3233.86 → 3235.22] You will find the one,
[3236.44 → 3236.94] the Saviour,
[3237.80 → 3238.86] or you will keep looking.
[3240.40 → 3241.36] And so that's John's question.
[3241.46 → 3242.94] Are you the one who is to come,
[3243.04 → 3244.62] or should we expect someone else?
[3244.62 → 3248.72] Now let's look at how Jesus responds
[3248.72 → 3249.50] to that question.
[3250.74 → 3250.92] Okay,
[3251.00 → 3252.50] how does Jesus respond
[3252.50 → 3253.94] to the question?
[3254.40 → 3254.96] Well, okay,
[3255.14 → 3256.70] here's what he doesn't say.
[3256.92 → 3257.64] This is important.
[3258.26 → 3259.38] He does not say,
[3259.58 → 3261.34] how dare you question me?
[3262.76 → 3263.88] Jesus doesn't say that.
[3266.00 → 3267.32] And that is good news,
[3267.58 → 3267.72] right?
[3267.76 → 3268.62] That's good news for us
[3268.62 → 3270.88] who might ask the same question
[3270.88 → 3271.70] that John is asking.
[3271.84 → 3272.84] Are you really the one?
[3272.84 → 3275.38] Jesus isn't put off
[3275.38 → 3276.86] by John's doubts.
[3276.96 → 3277.18] He's like,
[3277.26 → 3277.52] come on,
[3277.58 → 3278.56] my cousin.
[3279.26 → 3280.56] You're supposed to believe in me.
[3280.66 → 3281.58] Why are you doubting me?
[3281.60 → 3282.34] He doesn't say that.
[3282.52 → 3283.58] He doesn't take offence.
[3284.34 → 3284.96] He doesn't say,
[3285.14 → 3287.00] how dare you struggle to believe?
[3288.02 → 3289.10] He doesn't say that
[3289.10 → 3289.68] to anybody,
[3289.86 → 3290.02] any,
[3290.10 → 3290.42] any,
[3290.68 → 3290.98] you know,
[3291.06 → 3291.40] ever.
[3293.72 → 3294.88] Jesus answers him.
[3296.42 → 3298.34] But if you look at Jesus' answer
[3298.34 → 3299.22] in verse 22,
[3299.44 → 3301.28] it seems like Jesus is only
[3301.28 → 3302.44] just reiterating
[3302.44 → 3303.80] what John's disciples
[3303.80 → 3304.38] had already come
[3304.38 → 3304.94] and told him.
[3306.24 → 3307.44] So he replied
[3307.44 → 3308.22] to the messengers,
[3308.42 → 3308.92] go back,
[3309.00 → 3309.76] report to John
[3309.76 → 3311.22] what you have seen
[3311.22 → 3311.64] and heard.
[3311.76 → 3312.92] The blind receive sight,
[3313.56 → 3314.40] the lame walk,
[3314.50 → 3315.50] those who have leprosy
[3315.50 → 3316.10] are cleansed,
[3316.16 → 3316.80] the deaf hear,
[3316.92 → 3317.80] the dead are raised,
[3318.28 → 3319.04] and the good news
[3319.04 → 3319.64] is proclaimed
[3319.64 → 3320.34] to the poor.
[3322.38 → 3322.58] Right?
[3322.64 → 3323.26] John has likely
[3323.26 → 3324.58] already heard all of this,
[3324.84 → 3326.14] and Jesus says,
[3326.28 → 3326.62] yes,
[3327.28 → 3327.52] right?
[3327.52 → 3329.20] These are signs
[3329.20 → 3330.20] that signify
[3330.20 → 3331.38] I am the Messiah.
[3332.80 → 3333.78] But then,
[3333.90 → 3334.88] Jesus adds something
[3334.88 → 3336.58] really fascinating,
[3336.82 → 3338.04] really crucial.
[3339.08 → 3340.14] In verse 23,
[3340.66 → 3341.54] he goes on
[3341.54 → 3342.26] and he says,
[3342.94 → 3344.38] blessed is anyone
[3344.38 → 3345.96] who does not stumble
[3345.96 → 3348.56] on account of me.
[3349.70 → 3350.38] Or,
[3350.80 → 3352.20] blessed is the one
[3352.20 → 3353.62] who is not offended
[3353.62 → 3355.42] by me,
[3355.66 → 3356.34] is how another
[3356.34 → 3357.78] translation puts it.
[3358.88 → 3359.78] The Greek word
[3359.78 → 3361.18] is scandalized.
[3361.68 → 3362.22] Blessed is the one
[3362.22 → 3363.46] who is not scandalized
[3363.46 → 3363.96] by me.
[3365.84 → 3366.68] And this is
[3366.68 → 3368.12] the key for John,
[3368.90 → 3370.24] for him finding
[3370.24 → 3371.02] comfort in prison,
[3371.12 → 3371.88] and this is the key
[3371.88 → 3372.66] for us as well.
[3373.12 → 3374.52] There is a blessedness,
[3374.68 → 3375.36] a beatitude,
[3375.36 → 3376.56] this is a weird beatitude,
[3377.06 → 3377.20] but,
[3377.98 → 3379.32] blessed is anyone
[3379.32 → 3380.22] who does not stumble
[3380.22 → 3380.94] on account of me.
[3382.34 → 3383.56] There is a
[3383.56 → 3385.28] it is well with you
[3385.28 → 3385.88] reality
[3385.88 → 3387.32] for people who
[3387.32 → 3388.02] trust in Jesus
[3388.02 → 3389.14] and who align themselves
[3389.14 → 3389.78] with Jesus.
[3390.80 → 3391.06] And so,
[3391.18 → 3392.06] Jesus is essentially
[3392.06 → 3392.78] saying to John,
[3392.94 → 3393.18] yes,
[3393.26 → 3394.26] I am the one,
[3394.74 → 3395.70] but don't stumble
[3395.70 → 3397.38] over the way
[3397.38 → 3398.62] I am doing things.
[3400.58 → 3401.08] And so,
[3401.16 → 3401.82] it's almost as if
[3401.82 → 3402.58] Jesus is kind of
[3402.58 → 3403.00] expecting
[3403.00 → 3404.48] that some people
[3404.48 → 3406.10] are going to stumble.
[3406.26 → 3406.84] Some people
[3406.84 → 3408.08] will be offended.
[3409.20 → 3409.72] So,
[3409.78 → 3410.38] now let's ask,
[3410.46 → 3410.74] why?
[3412.18 → 3413.54] What about Jesus
[3413.54 → 3415.16] might cause someone
[3415.16 → 3416.12] to stumble?
[3418.04 → 3418.54] Well,
[3419.14 → 3420.36] lots of things,
[3420.82 → 3421.00] right?
[3421.76 → 3423.34] So many things
[3423.34 → 3424.78] that Jesus did,
[3424.90 → 3425.78] that Jesus said,
[3425.90 → 3426.98] that Jesus claimed,
[3427.38 → 3427.72] were,
[3428.12 → 3428.48] are,
[3428.76 → 3429.44] will be
[3429.44 → 3430.36] offensive.
[3431.42 → 3432.78] They were offensive then,
[3432.86 → 3433.98] they will be offensive now.
[3434.62 → 3434.96] I mean,
[3435.02 → 3436.06] he claimed to be God,
[3437.20 → 3437.48] right?
[3438.38 → 3438.66] That,
[3438.80 → 3439.88] in a pluralistic society
[3439.88 → 3441.16] that John talked about before,
[3441.30 → 3442.62] there is only one God
[3442.62 → 3443.38] and I am him.
[3444.22 → 3445.04] Very offensive.
[3446.30 → 3447.16] He insisted
[3447.16 → 3449.24] that he
[3449.24 → 3450.72] predated creation
[3450.72 → 3452.80] and
[3452.80 → 3454.02] that all people
[3454.02 → 3455.38] are to completely
[3455.38 → 3456.34] surrender to him.
[3457.30 → 3457.78] Right?
[3457.84 → 3459.00] The list of things
[3459.00 → 3460.04] that Jesus said
[3460.04 → 3460.42] and did
[3460.42 → 3461.02] and claimed
[3461.02 → 3461.94] that caused people
[3461.94 → 3462.48] to stumble
[3462.48 → 3463.80] is a long list.
[3464.36 → 3466.16] But there are two things
[3466.16 → 3466.82] in particular
[3466.82 → 3467.48] that our
[3467.48 → 3469.06] passage alludes to
[3469.06 → 3470.36] that caused people
[3470.36 → 3470.80] to stumble.
[3471.48 → 3472.36] So here's the first one,
[3472.42 → 3472.82] two things.
[3472.88 → 3473.76] The first one is this,
[3474.32 → 3475.58] how Jesus
[3475.58 → 3477.20] was a friend
[3477.20 → 3477.94] to the broken.
[3479.38 → 3479.58] Okay,
[3479.60 → 3480.22] that's one way.
[3480.66 → 3481.40] How he was
[3481.40 → 3482.04] a friend
[3482.04 → 3482.70] to the broken.
[3484.38 → 3485.24] Think about
[3485.24 → 3487.54] Jesus' response
[3487.54 → 3488.06] to John
[3488.06 → 3489.20] and all those people
[3489.20 → 3489.96] he talks about
[3489.96 → 3490.90] that he came
[3490.90 → 3491.44] to heal,
[3491.76 → 3492.36] that he came
[3492.36 → 3492.88] to help,
[3493.82 → 3494.50] that he mentions,
[3494.60 → 3495.24] the blind,
[3495.46 → 3496.08] the lame,
[3496.18 → 3496.72] the leper,
[3496.92 → 3497.50] the deaf.
[3497.50 → 3500.06] But Jesus,
[3500.22 → 3500.92] what's Jesus doing?
[3501.28 → 3502.08] He's not like
[3502.08 → 3503.22] abusing them,
[3503.40 → 3504.62] he's healing them.
[3505.38 → 3506.58] How is that offensive?
[3506.90 → 3507.20] I mean,
[3508.14 → 3509.00] you'd be happy,
[3509.10 → 3509.32] right?
[3509.96 → 3510.84] The dead are being
[3510.84 → 3511.66] raised back to life,
[3511.78 → 3512.50] people's problems
[3512.50 → 3513.26] are getting solved.
[3513.46 → 3514.50] That is not offensive.
[3516.00 → 3517.32] That's how we think
[3517.32 → 3518.32] as modern people.
[3519.38 → 3520.28] Because we look
[3520.28 → 3520.84] at these people
[3520.84 → 3521.86] and we see their problems
[3521.86 → 3523.54] as just physical problems.
[3525.06 → 3526.42] But one of the main things
[3526.42 → 3527.34] that Luke brings out
[3527.34 → 3528.04] in his gospel
[3528.04 → 3529.48] is that in that day
[3529.48 → 3530.76] they are not mainly
[3530.76 → 3531.92] physical problems.
[3532.20 → 3533.46] They are social problems
[3533.46 → 3534.96] and they are spiritual problems.
[3536.86 → 3538.08] All of these problems
[3538.08 → 3538.84] people have
[3538.84 → 3540.84] make them social outcasts
[3540.84 → 3543.00] and the religious community
[3543.00 → 3545.18] sees them as cursed by God.
[3546.80 → 3548.16] And so they don't have
[3548.16 → 3552.54] clean, happy, moral lives.
[3552.54 → 3554.84] You know,
[3554.98 → 3555.88] they're blind,
[3556.26 → 3557.06] they're poor,
[3557.40 → 3558.36] they're leprous.
[3559.24 → 3560.34] And Jesus is saying
[3560.34 → 3561.88] I'm going to be a friend
[3561.88 → 3563.20] to these broken
[3563.20 → 3564.54] and marginalized people.
[3564.70 → 3565.50] I love them.
[3565.74 → 3566.62] That's what I'm going
[3566.62 → 3567.80] to spend my time doing.
[3568.50 → 3569.90] That is what the Messiah
[3569.90 → 3570.94] is doing.
[3572.40 → 3573.82] And so part of the confusion,
[3574.38 → 3575.32] part of the questioning
[3575.32 → 3575.98] about Jesus
[3575.98 → 3578.74] is that people are seeing
[3578.74 → 3579.90] Jesus take this way
[3579.90 → 3580.76] of weakness
[3580.76 → 3583.22] that he came as a servant.
[3584.12 → 3584.24] Right?
[3584.28 → 3585.28] He didn't come in power.
[3585.42 → 3586.88] He didn't gather an army.
[3587.00 → 3588.06] He didn't stage a coup.
[3588.88 → 3590.42] He came to lift the lowly.
[3591.82 → 3592.76] And that caused
[3592.76 → 3593.56] many people
[3593.56 → 3594.48] to stumble.
[3596.90 → 3598.14] The second reason
[3598.14 → 3599.24] is how Jesus
[3599.24 → 3600.36] is not only a friend
[3600.36 → 3600.98] to the broken,
[3601.44 → 3602.42] he's a friend
[3602.42 → 3602.98] to sinners.
[3602.98 → 3605.20] So once
[3605.20 → 3606.30] John's messengers
[3606.30 → 3606.92] leave,
[3607.18 → 3608.60] Jesus turns to the crowd
[3608.60 → 3610.08] to teach them about John.
[3610.28 → 3610.42] Okay?
[3610.48 → 3612.04] Let's pay attention to this.
[3612.60 → 3613.16] He says
[3613.16 → 3614.54] to the crowd,
[3615.56 → 3616.60] what did you go out
[3616.60 → 3617.38] into the wilderness
[3617.38 → 3618.04] to see?
[3618.68 → 3619.64] He's questioning them.
[3620.10 → 3620.76] When you made
[3620.76 → 3621.58] that long,
[3622.14 → 3622.64] arduous,
[3622.80 → 3623.70] uncomfortable journey
[3623.70 → 3624.72] out into the wilderness,
[3625.86 → 3627.08] what did you go out
[3627.08 → 3627.42] to see?
[3628.06 → 3629.02] Did you go to see
[3629.02 → 3629.72] a reed
[3629.72 → 3630.96] swayed by the wind?
[3630.96 → 3632.28] In other words,
[3632.72 → 3633.34] did you go out
[3633.34 → 3633.94] to hear somebody
[3633.94 → 3634.92] tell you what you
[3634.92 → 3635.90] want to hear?
[3637.20 → 3637.42] Right?
[3637.46 → 3637.92] A preacher
[3637.92 → 3638.90] who swayed
[3638.90 → 3639.88] by every wind
[3639.88 → 3640.98] of popular opinion
[3640.98 → 3641.58] that existed
[3641.58 → 3642.26] at that time.
[3643.48 → 3643.92] No.
[3644.20 → 3644.68] That's not what
[3644.68 → 3645.34] they went out to see.
[3645.40 → 3645.92] They had plenty
[3645.92 → 3646.86] of this kind of preachers.
[3648.58 → 3649.22] Did you see,
[3649.86 → 3650.54] did you go to see
[3650.54 → 3651.16] a man dressed
[3651.16 → 3651.98] in fine clothes?
[3653.10 → 3653.56] Right?
[3653.60 → 3654.40] Who had a message
[3654.40 → 3654.98] about finding
[3654.98 → 3656.24] greater success
[3656.24 → 3656.72] and wealth
[3656.72 → 3657.54] and influence
[3657.54 → 3658.48] in this world?
[3659.92 → 3660.36] No.
[3660.36 → 3661.10] They had plenty
[3661.10 → 3661.72] of those too.
[3662.04 → 3663.78] John had nothing
[3663.78 → 3664.38] like that.
[3664.94 → 3665.56] He was dressed
[3665.56 → 3666.38] in camel's hair.
[3666.50 → 3667.32] He ate locusts
[3667.32 → 3667.72] and honey.
[3668.34 → 3668.46] Right?
[3668.54 → 3669.06] He offered
[3669.06 → 3670.66] no worldly gain
[3670.66 → 3671.26] at all.
[3671.38 → 3672.44] No hope
[3672.44 → 3673.02] to be found
[3673.02 → 3673.62] in this world.
[3675.60 → 3676.04] Or,
[3676.16 → 3676.60] Jesus says,
[3676.66 → 3677.10] did you go out
[3677.10 → 3677.78] to see a prophet?
[3679.28 → 3680.32] And I tell you,
[3680.38 → 3681.06] you saw more
[3681.06 → 3681.72] than a prophet.
[3681.82 → 3682.92] You saw the prophet
[3682.92 → 3683.62] of prophets.
[3684.44 → 3685.34] He's the one
[3685.34 → 3686.16] who's preparing
[3686.16 → 3686.64] the way
[3686.64 → 3687.30] for the Messiah.
[3687.46 → 3687.84] That's who
[3687.84 → 3688.24] you went out
[3688.24 → 3688.56] to see.
[3688.56 → 3691.10] In John's preaching,
[3691.40 → 3691.82] he preached
[3691.82 → 3692.92] the word of the Lord
[3692.92 → 3694.42] and it was offensive.
[3695.34 → 3696.54] It caused people
[3696.54 → 3697.24] to stumble.
[3698.34 → 3698.58] Why?
[3699.92 → 3700.98] Because he's telling
[3700.98 → 3701.54] the people
[3701.54 → 3702.68] that they
[3702.68 → 3703.68] are the ones
[3703.68 → 3704.92] who were spiritually
[3704.92 → 3705.38] sick
[3705.38 → 3707.00] and needed healing.
[3707.84 → 3709.32] They are the ones
[3709.32 → 3710.06] who were spiritually
[3710.06 → 3710.50] dead
[3710.50 → 3711.50] and needed to be raised.
[3712.30 → 3712.44] Right?
[3712.52 → 3713.60] It wasn't the Romans
[3713.60 → 3714.42] who were rebelling
[3714.42 → 3715.48] against God's purposes.
[3715.48 → 3717.64] They had rebellion
[3717.64 → 3718.52] against God
[3718.52 → 3719.28] in their hearts.
[3720.74 → 3721.26] And then Luke
[3721.26 → 3722.44] adds this parenthetical
[3722.44 → 3723.26] comment
[3723.26 → 3724.66] in verses
[3724.66 → 3726.22] 29 and 30.
[3726.32 → 3726.80] Let's look at
[3726.80 → 3727.50] those passages.
[3727.98 → 3728.66] 29 and 30.
[3729.26 → 3729.90] Luke says,
[3730.48 → 3731.26] all the people,
[3731.64 → 3732.74] even the tax collectors,
[3732.84 → 3733.46] when they heard
[3733.46 → 3734.44] Jesus' words,
[3735.14 → 3735.60] acknowledged
[3735.60 → 3736.76] that God's way
[3736.76 → 3737.44] was right
[3737.44 → 3738.64] because they had
[3738.64 → 3739.10] been baptized
[3739.10 → 3739.70] by John.
[3740.66 → 3742.00] But the Pharisees,
[3742.14 → 3742.58] the experts
[3742.58 → 3743.16] in the law,
[3743.70 → 3745.06] rejected God's purposes
[3745.06 → 3745.82] for themselves
[3745.82 → 3747.30] because they had
[3747.30 → 3748.38] not been baptized
[3748.38 → 3749.14] by John.
[3750.12 → 3751.20] What's going on here?
[3752.40 → 3753.22] John said
[3753.22 → 3754.46] his message,
[3755.50 → 3756.88] you need to repent
[3756.88 → 3758.92] and come to God
[3758.92 → 3759.80] in humility.
[3760.78 → 3761.78] That's offensive.
[3762.70 → 3763.92] You need to repent.
[3764.06 → 3765.06] You need to come to God.
[3766.72 → 3768.04] But it's preaching
[3768.04 → 3769.04] that goes deep
[3769.04 → 3770.72] into one's heart
[3770.72 → 3772.40] and into one's mind
[3772.40 → 3773.14] and soul.
[3773.14 → 3774.06] And the people
[3774.06 → 3775.24] came out to hear that.
[3776.36 → 3777.20] And some people
[3777.20 → 3778.72] received the message
[3778.72 → 3779.52] and they were
[3779.52 → 3780.66] baptized by John.
[3781.54 → 3782.48] Well, some people
[3782.48 → 3783.80] stumbled on account
[3783.80 → 3784.20] of Jesus.
[3784.72 → 3785.60] Some were offended.
[3786.06 → 3786.72] They were not
[3786.72 → 3787.66] baptized by John.
[3788.38 → 3789.08] Why not?
[3789.60 → 3790.88] Because by rejecting
[3790.88 → 3791.90] John's baptism,
[3792.32 → 3793.06] they rejected
[3793.06 → 3793.98] his message
[3793.98 → 3794.98] of repentance.
[3795.98 → 3796.96] And by rejecting
[3796.96 → 3797.64] his message
[3797.64 → 3798.28] of repentance,
[3798.72 → 3799.70] they were denying
[3799.70 → 3800.84] their sinfulness
[3800.84 → 3801.56] and their need
[3801.56 → 3802.32] for a saviour,
[3803.12 → 3803.56] their need
[3803.56 → 3804.24] for forgiveness.
[3805.76 → 3806.82] In Jesus' day,
[3806.90 → 3807.54] in John's day,
[3807.68 → 3808.72] nobody rejected
[3808.72 → 3809.90] Jesus because
[3809.90 → 3810.88] of a lack
[3810.88 → 3811.36] of evidence.
[3812.94 → 3813.72] The miracles
[3813.72 → 3814.46] Jesus did
[3814.46 → 3816.10] were undeniable.
[3817.74 → 3818.56] But still,
[3818.64 → 3820.08] people rejected
[3820.08 → 3820.38] him.
[3820.64 → 3821.60] Why wouldn't
[3821.60 → 3822.12] they believe
[3822.12 → 3822.64] in him?
[3824.26 → 3825.18] Isn't that obvious?
[3825.44 → 3826.36] He's raising
[3826.36 → 3826.80] the dead.
[3826.80 → 3828.52] Why would
[3828.52 → 3829.26] anybody reject
[3829.26 → 3829.94] Jesus as the
[3829.94 → 3830.28] Messiah?
[3831.04 → 3831.88] Because of the
[3831.88 → 3832.56] offensiveness
[3832.56 → 3833.30] of Jesus.
[3834.46 → 3835.12] Because of
[3835.12 → 3836.54] an unwillingness
[3836.54 → 3837.00] to admit
[3837.00 → 3837.80] before the
[3837.80 → 3838.26] God of the
[3838.26 → 3838.52] universe
[3838.52 → 3839.38] that they
[3839.38 → 3840.12] are sinners
[3840.12 → 3840.76] in need
[3840.76 → 3841.34] of forgiveness,
[3841.94 → 3842.32] in need
[3842.32 → 3842.84] of grace.
[3843.68 → 3844.42] Sinners in
[3844.42 → 3845.02] need of the
[3845.02 → 3845.52] friendship
[3845.52 → 3846.90] that Jesus
[3846.90 → 3848.12] came to offer.
[3849.14 → 3849.72] So only
[3849.72 → 3850.40] an openness
[3850.40 → 3851.02] to the
[3851.02 → 3851.62] offence of
[3851.62 → 3852.04] Jesus
[3852.04 → 3853.38] can receive
[3853.38 → 3853.80] that kind
[3853.80 → 3854.24] of grace.
[3854.24 → 3856.06] And friends,
[3856.16 → 3856.82] if you this
[3856.82 → 3857.08] morning,
[3857.16 → 3857.96] if you feel
[3857.96 → 3859.04] the offence
[3859.04 → 3860.52] that you
[3860.52 → 3860.96] are not
[3860.96 → 3861.54] good enough,
[3862.74 → 3863.12] that the
[3863.12 → 3863.64] Son of God
[3863.64 → 3864.30] actually had
[3864.30 → 3864.78] to die
[3864.78 → 3865.26] for you
[3865.26 → 3867.08] to forgive
[3867.08 → 3867.64] you your
[3867.64 → 3868.00] sins,
[3868.10 → 3868.36] to make
[3868.36 → 3868.70] you right
[3868.70 → 3869.30] with God,
[3870.20 → 3870.56] good.
[3872.16 → 3873.10] Be offended.
[3874.44 → 3875.46] Because his
[3875.46 → 3876.12] claims,
[3876.34 → 3877.08] his cross,
[3877.58 → 3878.26] they are
[3878.26 → 3878.68] offensive.
[3879.80 → 3880.54] They tell us
[3880.54 → 3881.00] that we can
[3881.00 → 3881.42] be saved
[3881.42 → 3882.42] only by grace
[3882.42 → 3882.78] alone.
[3883.46 → 3883.68] Right?
[3883.68 → 3884.04] Not by
[3884.04 → 3884.52] propping
[3884.52 → 3884.90] ourselves
[3884.90 → 3885.24] up,
[3885.58 → 3885.94] comparing
[3885.94 → 3886.50] ourselves
[3886.50 → 3887.66] to others.
[3888.64 → 3890.48] By seeing
[3890.48 → 3891.16] ourselves
[3891.16 → 3891.74] in the
[3891.74 → 3892.16] company
[3892.16 → 3893.28] of sinners.
[3896.18 → 3897.10] Are you
[3897.10 → 3897.54] the one,
[3897.64 → 3897.90] Jesus,
[3898.66 → 3899.52] who has
[3899.52 → 3899.88] come?
[3900.74 → 3901.54] Or should
[3901.54 → 3901.84] we look
[3901.84 → 3902.20] for someone
[3902.20 → 3902.54] else?
[3903.24 → 3903.70] It's okay
[3903.70 → 3904.10] to ask
[3904.10 → 3904.36] that.
[3905.52 → 3906.12] But most
[3906.12 → 3906.58] of all,
[3906.66 → 3906.88] friends,
[3906.98 → 3907.52] come to
[3907.52 → 3908.58] him with
[3908.58 → 3909.02] repentance
[3909.02 → 3909.62] and faith.
[3910.78 → 3911.50] He is the
[3911.50 → 3911.96] friend of the
[3911.96 → 3912.22] broken.
[3912.22 → 3912.34] broken.
[3913.10 → 3913.62] And he
[3913.62 → 3913.92] is the
[3913.92 → 3914.30] friend of
[3914.30 → 3914.68] sinners.
[3915.86 → 3916.84] And may
[3916.84 → 3918.48] your hearts
[3918.48 → 3920.42] be
[3920.42 → 3920.84] restless
[3920.84 → 3923.32] until
[3923.32 → 3924.52] you find
[3924.52 → 3925.00] your rest
[3925.00 → 3925.44] in him.
[3926.76 → 3927.46] Let's pray
[3927.46 → 3927.80] together.
[3927.80 → 3934.42] Lord Jesus,
[3934.60 → 3934.90] we are
[3934.90 → 3935.50] amazed
[3935.50 → 3937.48] that you
[3937.48 → 3937.90] are a
[3937.90 → 3938.98] friend of
[3938.98 → 3939.38] the broken.
[3940.96 → 3941.48] Lord,
[3941.56 → 3942.04] you are the
[3942.04 → 3942.50] friend of
[3942.50 → 3942.84] sinners.
[3944.16 → 3944.74] And we
[3944.74 → 3945.20] have seen
[3945.20 → 3945.64] how many
[3945.64 → 3946.56] times we
[3946.56 → 3947.42] have sinned
[3947.42 → 3948.36] and you
[3948.36 → 3948.76] have not
[3948.76 → 3949.22] left us
[3949.22 → 3949.84] to ourselves.
[3950.72 → 3951.38] You are
[3951.38 → 3952.14] near to us
[3952.14 → 3952.44] and your
[3952.44 → 3953.50] grace is
[3953.50 → 3954.48] overflowing
[3954.48 → 3955.06] and abundant.
[3956.54 → 3956.84] And Lord,
[3956.90 → 3957.44] when we
[3957.44 → 3958.56] wonder whether
[3958.56 → 3959.06] or not you
[3959.06 → 3959.62] might reject
[3959.62 → 3960.42] us because
[3960.42 → 3961.54] of our
[3961.54 → 3961.92] sin,
[3962.00 → 3962.36] you say
[3962.36 → 3962.78] no.
[3962.94 → 3963.44] And the
[3963.44 → 3964.86] wells of
[3964.86 → 3965.64] living water
[3965.64 → 3966.12] and the
[3966.12 → 3967.22] grace that
[3967.22 → 3967.70] you offer
[3967.70 → 3968.48] can never,
[3969.64 → 3970.28] we can never
[3970.28 → 3971.06] outrun that.
[3972.20 → 3972.50] So Lord,
[3972.56 → 3973.06] help us to
[3973.06 → 3973.48] believe that.
[3973.58 → 3974.02] Help us to
[3974.02 → 3974.64] live in that.
[3975.44 → 3976.14] Give us the
[3976.14 → 3976.48] courage,
[3976.60 → 3976.68] Lord,
[3976.74 → 3977.48] to seek you
[3977.48 → 3978.38] and to
[3978.38 → 3979.22] find you
[3979.22 → 3980.38] and to
[3980.38 → 3980.94] rest in
[3980.94 → 3981.30] you
[3981.30 → 3982.64] and then
[3982.64 → 3983.02] to follow
[3983.02 → 3983.30] you.
[3983.62 → 3984.32] We ask in
[3984.32 → 3984.52] Jesus'
[3984.70 → 3984.86] name.
[3985.46 → 3985.76] Amen.
[3988.88 → 3989.36] All right,
[3989.40 → 3989.66] let's all
[3989.66 → 3990.70] stand and
[3990.70 → 3991.18] we'll sing
[3991.18 → 3991.62] a song of
[3991.62 → 3992.02] response.
[4009.22 → 4011.36] sing.
[4011.80 → 4012.74] We won't
[4012.74 → 4013.40] fear the
[4013.40 → 4014.22] battle,
[4014.68 → 4015.38] we won't
[4015.38 → 4016.04] fear the
[4016.04 → 4016.92] fight,
[4017.36 → 4018.00] we will
[4018.00 → 4018.78] walk the
[4018.78 → 4020.48] valley with
[4020.48 → 4021.16] you by
[4021.16 → 4022.44] our side.
[4022.94 → 4023.54] You will
[4023.54 → 4024.30] go before
[4024.30 → 4025.32] us,
[4025.60 → 4026.24] you will
[4026.24 → 4026.92] lead the
[4026.92 → 4027.60] way,
[4028.20 → 4028.88] we have
[4028.88 → 4029.58] found a
[4029.58 → 4030.86] way to
[4030.86 → 4031.48] totally
[4031.48 → 4032.30] you can
[4032.30 → 4033.62] save.
[4034.92 → 4035.60] Sing,
[4035.60 → 4036.14] we're
[4036.14 → 4037.44] going now,
[4037.80 → 4038.18] our
[4038.18 → 4038.82] rock is
[4038.82 → 4039.42] tall
[4039.42 → 4040.08] us,
[4040.48 → 4040.72] the
[4040.72 → 4041.46] Father's
[4041.46 → 4042.40] love is
[4042.40 → 4042.66] so
[4042.66 → 4043.10] strong
[4043.10 → 4043.36] and
[4043.36 → 4043.78] mighty
[4043.78 → 4044.98] fortress.
[4045.40 → 4046.56] Raise your
[4046.56 → 4047.88] voice down,
[4048.24 → 4048.56] O
[4048.56 → 4049.22] love us
[4049.22 → 4049.96] maker,
[4050.50 → 4051.12] who can
[4051.12 → 4051.52] stand
[4051.52 → 4052.16] against
[4052.16 → 4052.48] us,
[4052.84 → 4053.18] our
[4053.18 → 4053.78] God
[4053.78 → 4054.32] is
[4054.32 → 4055.04] for
[4055.04 → 4055.90] us.
[4060.64 → 4061.14] Even
[4061.14 → 4062.04] when I
[4062.04 → 4062.72] stumble,
[4063.34 → 4063.82] even
[4063.82 → 4064.70] when I
[4064.70 → 4065.36] fall,
[4066.00 → 4066.50] even
[4066.50 → 4067.36] when I
[4067.36 → 4068.00] turn
[4068.00 → 4068.74] back to
[4068.74 → 4069.00] the
[4069.00 → 4069.64] love
[4069.64 → 4070.00] and
[4070.00 → 4071.00] still
[4071.00 → 4071.98] on the
[4071.98 → 4072.54] shore.
[4072.54 → 4074.08] You will
[4074.08 → 4074.54] never
[4074.54 → 4076.08] forsake,
[4076.54 → 4077.28] you will
[4077.28 → 4078.66] cheer me on,
[4079.16 → 4079.80] never
[4079.80 → 4080.38] any
[4080.38 → 4081.80] place.
[4082.96 → 4083.70] Sing,
[4083.70 → 4084.28] live,
[4084.34 → 4085.62] join now,
[4086.00 → 4086.32] our
[4086.32 → 4086.88] bodies
[4086.88 → 4088.20] for us,
[4088.58 → 4088.84] the
[4088.84 → 4090.26] Father's love
[4090.26 → 4090.78] is a
[4090.78 → 4091.48] strong and
[4091.48 → 4091.96] mighty
[4091.96 → 4092.88] fortress.
[4093.46 → 4094.66] Raise your
[4094.66 → 4095.90] wise town,
[4096.30 → 4096.56] no
[4096.56 → 4097.22] love is
[4097.22 → 4098.00] greater,
[4098.56 → 4099.10] who can
[4099.10 → 4099.54] stand
[4099.54 → 4100.14] against
[4100.14 → 4101.04] our
[4101.04 → 4102.20] bodies
[4102.20 → 4103.88] for us.
[4103.88 → 4114.36] for our
[4114.36 → 4115.36] health is
[4115.36 → 4115.50] poor and
[4115.50 → 4115.82] poor and
[4115.82 → 4116.32] not
[4116.32 → 4117.52] The root
[4117.52 → 4118.12] foretelling fast.
[4118.12 → 4119.62] Sexual and
[4119.62 → 4120.92] death will
[4120.92 → 4121.26] acute
[4121.26 → 4121.74] lead us
[4121.74 → 4122.24] out of
[4122.24 → 4122.46] Thy
[4122.46 → 4122.80] meaning,
[4122.80 → 4123.20] Hi
[4123.20 → 4123.80] class,
[4123.80 → 4124.46] hi
[4124.46 → 4124.84] Lord,
[4124.84 → 4125.10] HY
[4125.10 → 4126.00] will
[4126.00 → 4126.62] help me
[4126.62 → 4126.82] in Differ tun,
[4126.82 → 4127.16] even
[4127.16 → 4127.64] tended down.
[4127.64 → 4128.82] younger and
[4128.82 → 4129.52] daughter's
[4129.52 → 4130.74] God will
[4130.74 → 4131.62] help us
[4131.62 → 4142.98] When our great hornet let separate us, hell and death will not defeat us.
[4143.28 → 4152.02] He who gave his Son to free us, rose in his love.
[4152.02 → 4165.02] Sing with joy now, our God is for us. The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[4165.02 → 4174.90] Raise your bones now, your lowest flavour will kiss them and kiss us. Our God is for us.
[4174.90 → 4183.90] Sing with joy now, our God is for us. The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[4183.90 → 4194.90] Raise your bones now, your lowest flavour will kiss them and kiss us. Our God is for us.
[4204.90 → 4222.76] So we'll continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and our offerings.
[4222.76 → 4233.76] As John mentioned, you can see our offering is for Alex. Now in your bulletin is printed his last name.
[4233.76 → 4237.76] And in your bulletin is printed the mission organization he is going with.
[4237.76 → 4243.76] But we're not going to put it on the screen because this is live YouTube, and he's going to a secure and sensitive location.
[4243.76 → 4254.76] Okay, but Alex and his wife Nicole are raising support to go to the Middle East working with a different religious group that John alluded to earlier.
[4254.76 → 4263.76] And the organization he's going with is a reformed organization that has people from different denominations.
[4263.76 → 4268.76] They're excellent. And so Alex and his wife, Alex preached for us about a year ago.
[4268.76 → 4275.76] And they are raising support to go to be long term, really lifelong, Lord willing missionaries to these people.
[4275.76 → 4282.76] So that's the explanation. And may I invite our deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[4282.76 → 4293.76] .
[4293.76 → 4297.76] .
[4297.76 → 4301.76] .
[4301.76 → 4303.76] .
[4303.76 → 4305.76] .
[4305.76 → 4307.76] Amen.
[4335.76 → 4337.76] Amen.
[4365.76 → 4367.76] Amen.
[4395.76 → 4397.76] Amen.
[4425.76 → 4427.76] Amen.
[4455.76 → 4457.76] Amen.
[4485.76 → 4486.76] Amen.
[4486.76 → 4487.76] Amen.
[4487.76 → 4489.76] Amen.
[4489.76 → 4491.76] Amen.
[4495.76 → 4504.76] So we'll pray now for our life together as a church and for the world.
[4504.76 → 4507.76] One thing we'll pray for is John Windermere.
[4507.76 → 4511.76] His older brother Clarence passed away just recently from cancer.
[4511.76 → 4516.18] from cancer. So we'll pray for John and for others also who've recently lost loved ones.
[4516.74 → 4519.28] But let's join our hearts in prayer before the Lord.
[4522.02 → 4529.74] Our Heavenly Father, we come to you, the God of all peace, knowing that you do not give to us as
[4529.74 → 4536.38] the world gives. For you, Lord, have established an everlasting peace through the life, death,
[4536.38 → 4543.24] and resurrection of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord, we long for the world to know
[4543.24 → 4550.90] your peace. And so we pray, Lord, for rulers, for all those in authority. Especially this morning,
[4551.00 → 4557.74] we pray for our government of Canada, for our Prime Minister, his cabinet members, all members of
[4557.74 → 4566.12] Parliament and legislators. We ask, Lord, for your wisdom for them, for judgments and laws that make
[4566.12 → 4572.04] for peace, so that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
[4573.44 → 4580.44] We pray that justice would be reflected in our land, that evil would be restrained and human dignity
[4580.44 → 4588.48] upheld, and that the gospel may be freely proclaimed, and that it would bear fruit in this nation and
[4588.48 → 4595.34] throughout the world. Lord, we thank you for the freedom that we have to worship you. Lord, we know
[4595.34 → 4602.74] what we pray, Lord, for other churches and ministries in Ladder that are making this gospel known.
[4603.78 → 4611.34] Lord, we pray for Ladder Baptist, Lighthouse, Cedar Park, River Valley, that you would use them to build
[4611.34 → 4618.66] up your people in faith and holiness. And we ask that many would come to know you through their witness.
[4618.66 → 4626.54] Lord, we pray for Alex and his wife, who are preparing to go to the Middle East, Lord, to share the knowledge of who you are,
[4626.54 → 4634.90] the good news of the gospel, of who Jesus is, that he is the Messiah, and what he came to do.
[4635.70 → 4643.54] We pray, Lord, for their support raising needs. Would you meet their goal? And would you provide, Lord,
[4643.54 → 4649.72] all that is needed for them? Because, Lord, you have called them to this work. And we know that you are able
[4649.72 → 4656.66] to supply all their needs, and that the God who calls will also supply. Lord, would you also prepare
[4656.66 → 4664.02] their hearts as well as they prepare to step into many unknowns and many challenges for your name's sake?
[4664.50 → 4670.14] Help them, Lord, even now as they seek to start learning the language. Lord, prepare their tongues.
[4670.14 → 4677.54] And, Lord, prepare their paths before them. We pray also, Lord, for your work in our midst.
[4678.36 → 4685.00] We ask, Lord, that you would comfort and heal those who are struggling with injuries and with illnesses.
[4685.90 → 4692.06] And, Lord, this morning we pray especially for Shirley Mass, who has been in and out of the hospital this week.
[4693.60 → 4698.42] Lord, we pray, Lord, for your healing upon her. Lord, would you strengthen her heart?
[4698.42 → 4704.78] Would you give her the peace that the world doesn't give, but that can come from you, Lord?
[4705.48 → 4708.28] We ask, Lord, for your healing, your full healing upon her.
[4709.20 → 4713.94] We ask, Lord, that you would comfort those who are suffering from the recent loss of loved ones.
[4714.94 → 4718.06] We particularly pray, as we mentioned, Lord, for John.
[4719.60 → 4724.66] We pray for others, Lord. We pray for Serena, who also mourns the loss of her brother-in-law.
[4724.66 → 4729.24] For Kevin and Jana, who mourn the loss of Jana's sister.
[4729.96 → 4733.12] For Jane, who mourns the loss of her close relative.
[4734.88 → 4740.70] And, Lord, we ask that you would comfort them, even, Lord, as they grieve.
[4741.90 → 4746.46] And, Lord, help them to comfort others with the peace that they have received from you.
[4746.46 → 4753.88] As they, Lord, share the comfort that they know with their family and friends and others around them.
[4755.68 → 4758.98] And, finally, Lord, we thank you for who you are.
[4759.64 → 4763.50] We thank you for what you have come to do for your work in our lives.
[4764.56 → 4768.00] The presence and the power of the Holy Spirit within us.
[4768.00 → 4775.24] By which, Lord, you give us the strength to obey you, to hear your voice, to follow after our Good Shepherd.
[4776.08 → 4779.82] Lord, would you help us to do so today and each day.
[4780.50 → 4782.82] And we pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[4784.68 → 4785.50] Let's all stand.
[4786.44 → 4788.66] It's been a great joy to worship with you this morning.
[4788.66 → 4793.64] So, I invite you now to lift your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4794.76 → 4796.46] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4797.14 → 4800.20] The Lord lift his face upon you and be gracious to you.
[4800.82 → 4803.84] The Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[4804.58 → 4804.86] Amen.
[4805.70 → 4806.80] Please remain standing.
[4807.12 → 4808.18] We'll sing our final song.
[4808.60 → 4814.28] And do join us for a time of fellowship and coffee after the service right through the doors in the fellowship hall.
[4814.74 → 4817.86] Do sign up for our upcoming soup and bun lunch.
[4817.86 → 4820.36] There's a sign-up sheet on the foyer table.
[4820.72 → 4821.08] Thank you.
[4821.08 → 4822.08] Thank you.
[4822.08 → 4837.08] Take my heart and let me be.
[4837.08 → 4841.90] I'll sing with the Lord to thee.
[4841.90 → 4846.90] Take my heart and let me be.
[4846.90 → 4848.36] Take my heart and let me be.
[4848.36 → 4852.40] Let them flow in endless praise.
[4852.82 → 4858.30] Let them flow in endless praise.
[4858.70 → 4863.90] Take my heart and let me be.
[4864.28 → 4868.90] And be in hosts of the Lord.
[4868.90 → 4874.20] Take my feet and let them be
[4874.20 → 4878.90] Strength and beautiful for Thee
[4879.54 → 4884.90] Strength and beautiful for Thee
[4885.68 → 4890.40] Take my heart, sin and blessing
[4890.40 → 4896.14] Always only for my pain
[4896.14 → 4900.58] Take my hands, sin and blessing
[4900.58 → 4906.14] Fill with messages on Thee
[4906.70 → 4912.14] Fill with messages on Thee
[4912.70 → 4918.18] Take my will and make Him mine
[4918.18 → 4923.22] It shall be no longer mine
[4923.22 → 4927.66] Take my heart, it is Thy home
[4927.66 → 4933.54] It shall be Thy Lord of Throne
[4933.54 → 4939.66] It shall be Thy Lord of Throne
[4939.66 → 4945.22] Take my heart, my Lord, I'm Lord
[4945.22 → 4950.66] And my feet in treasure store
[4950.66 → 4955.54] Take my soul, my God will be
[4955.54 → 4961.54] Ever only all for Thee
[4961.54 → 4967.66] Ever only all for Thee
[4967.66 → 4970.04] We are dismissed
[4970.04 → 4972.10] We are dismissed
[4972.10 → 4986.36] From Mark
[4988.50 → 4991.46] Here's your songs
[4991.46 → 4992.46] Amen.
