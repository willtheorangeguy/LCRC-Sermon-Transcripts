[0.00 → 29.98] Sitsang with Moon
[30.00 → 31.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 274.64] Good morning to you all on this beautiful February day.
[275.18 → 276.24] It's very warm.
[276.40 → 277.02] The sun is shining.
[277.16 → 280.18] I just went out and took a little walk around the building just to enjoy the sun a bit.
[281.30 → 283.56] And so welcome to worship on this Lord's Day.
[283.70 → 284.52] My name is Jason.
[284.66 → 285.64] I'm the lead pastor here.
[286.12 → 291.20] And I want to extend a warm greeting to you, especially if you are new and visiting with
[291.20 → 291.86] us today.
[292.88 → 298.54] And so just one announcement to make before we begin our worship this morning.
[298.54 → 301.44] So I'll invite John Bannister to come up and give that announcement.
[308.88 → 309.80] Good morning.
[311.92 → 317.00] I'm speaking on behalf of the revived new immigrant support team.
[317.64 → 326.48] I would like to call your attention to a bulletin insert I put in about sponsoring Mule.
[326.48 → 329.12] That's the mother of Kikuyu Area.
[330.46 → 335.30] And Kikuyu and Salem and their girls are members of our church.
[335.30 → 338.18] And we sponsored them in the fall of 2020.
[339.14 → 341.14] Just a little over four years ago.
[341.14 → 343.60] And I don't see them here.
[343.68 → 345.28] They're usually sitting in the corner over there.
[345.82 → 349.22] I was going to introduce you to them if you don't know them.
[349.30 → 351.44] But anyway, if you see them around, you can talk to them.
[351.44 → 362.58] Because of changes in the Canadian sponsorship guidelines, we now need to have 50% of funding
[362.58 → 371.08] in the bank before we can even send in the application for her interview with IRCC.
[371.08 → 379.90] And because of that, our deacons have scheduled a special offering in two weeks' time for new immigrant support
[379.90 → 381.52] to build up our fund.
[382.58 → 384.90] We thank you in advance for your support.
[385.66 → 390.08] And we know that in the past, our congregation has been very supportive and generous.
[390.08 → 402.10] And due to lower immigration levels, our staffing has been cut back in IRCC Department of the Federal Government.
[402.56 → 405.84] So it is unknown how long this process could take.
[405.92 → 411.38] It could be up to two or three, even four years after an interview.
[411.38 → 421.50] We pray that Mullah's application will go smooth so she can be reunited with Kikuyu and Salem and her grandchildren.
[422.06 → 422.82] Thank you.
[433.04 → 439.26] Okay, so we begin our time of worship today with God's call to us, the call to worship.
[439.26 → 444.92] And as we think about that, one question we might ask is, well, who should worship?
[446.32 → 450.28] Who does God call to worship him?
[450.94 → 456.18] So what I want to do is name some of the types of people that God calls to worship.
[456.70 → 462.68] And I want you to listen and see if you can identify yourself in one of these groups of people.
[464.62 → 467.36] To all who are weary and need rest.
[467.36 → 471.88] To all who feel alone and want to belong.
[472.88 → 475.24] To all who mourn and long for comfort.
[476.38 → 479.68] To all who feel worthless and wonder if God cares.
[480.82 → 483.60] To all who have joy and are full of praise.
[484.64 → 487.52] To all who fail and desire strength.
[487.52 → 490.86] To all who sin and need a saviour.
[491.30 → 493.48] And to whoever will come.
[494.04 → 495.98] God opens wide his arms of mercy.
[496.62 → 500.30] And he calls you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ.
[501.36 → 505.00] And so if you were able to identify with any of those groups of people, please rise.
[505.74 → 508.40] And join me for the call to worship this morning.
[508.40 → 513.46] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[513.66 → 514.64] Whom shall I fear?
[515.58 → 518.52] The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
[518.70 → 521.04] Of whom shall I be afraid?
[521.96 → 525.06] One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek.
[525.72 → 530.50] That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
[530.50 → 536.48] To gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.
[537.28 → 540.66] My heart says of you, seek his face.
[541.30 → 544.26] Your face, Lord, I will seek.
[544.54 → 546.42] Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[547.56 → 551.94] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, we praise you this morning because you are good.
[552.76 → 555.70] You are good, and we have no good apart from you.
[555.70 → 559.84] And it is good for us to be near you, O God.
[560.32 → 561.78] To come into your courts.
[562.44 → 563.36] Into your presence.
[563.52 → 567.80] To dwell with you and to worship you with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[568.56 → 571.68] We praise you for making us your people, your sons and daughters.
[572.86 → 576.16] And we praise you that your steadfast love endures forever.
[576.84 → 581.74] That regardless of where we go wayward, you draw us back to yourself.
[581.90 → 583.62] Just as you are doing this morning.
[583.62 → 587.90] We praise you, and we pray in the matchless name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[588.28 → 588.68] Amen.
[590.18 → 594.04] So God calls us with these words from Jude, verse 1 and 2.
[594.98 → 600.46] To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ,
[600.98 → 604.14] may mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[605.30 → 606.92] May the peace of the Lord be with you.
[607.56 → 608.86] And also be with you.
[608.92 → 609.34] Thank you.
[609.40 → 613.22] Let's turn and extend that peace of the Lord to one another.
[613.22 → 613.32] Amen.
[613.62 → 614.18] Amen.
[614.18 → 616.18] Amen.

[642.84 → 643.02] Amen.
[643.02 → 643.60] Amen.
[643.60 → 658.94] Good morning.
[659.86 → 663.52] Just going to lead the first hymn from the organ today.
[663.52 → 672.76] And the scripture today will be addressing or focusing on the relationship that God had with Abraham and his people at the time.
[672.76 → 680.30] And I chose to use this hymn, The God of Abraham Praise, which you probably will recognize the melody.
[680.40 → 688.20] And it's interesting for this one that the melody actually comes from a Hebrew melody.
[688.60 → 698.28] So in many cultures around the world, I know from others that I've talked to, like in areas of Colombia or in the Middle East,
[698.84 → 701.88] singing in the minor key isn't something that is sad.
[701.88 → 703.74] It's something that they enjoy.
[704.48 → 708.84] And I know Welsh people are the same, have a real attraction to the minor key.
[708.92 → 716.36] So it's in the minor key, but it's a song about God and all the reasons that we have to praise him.
[716.48 → 720.52] So let's join our voices together and sing The God of Abraham Praise.
[720.52 → 725.52] The God of Abraham Praise, who reigns at throne of life,
[725.52 → 747.08] The God of Abraham Praise, who reigns at throne of love,
[747.08 → 760.04] The ancient of eternal days, the ancient of eternal days, the God of love.
[760.04 → 769.04] The Lord the great I am, higher than heaven's best.
[769.04 → 775.50] We bow before his holy name forever.
[775.50 → 780.42] In much of his holy name forever.
[780.48 → 784.66] He buy his name let's 7,
[784.66 → 790.36] And all saints shall depend,
[790.40 → 795.46] And as on evil's play artful to endless stage.
[795.46 → 805.46] Then we shall see his face, his power we shall adore,
[806.58 → 815.46] and sing the wonders of his grace forevermore.
[815.46 → 825.62] The earthly land I sing, with peace and plenty blessed,
[826.20 → 835.08] a land of safe and liberty and endless rest.
[835.08 → 844.08] Their milk and honey flow, and all that wine about,
[844.08 → 854.08] the tree of life forever grows with mercy crown.
[855.84 → 863.32] Their rules, our Lord, our King, our Lord, our righteousness,
[863.32 → 873.72] victorious over death, our sin, our glimpse of peace.
[873.72 → 883.12] Our joyous sacred height, his kingdom he may chase,
[883.12 → 893.12] and glorious with his saints in light forever remains.
[893.12 → 903.20] Triumphant, O sun high, lift thanks to God in sin,
[903.20 → 913.28] and holy, holy, holy, almighty day.
[913.28 → 922.96] Believe them, God, and us, one night if we praise,
[922.96 → 933.28] all power and majesty be yours, and endless praise.
[933.28 → 945.44] Repeat your papers first.
[945.44 → 946.48] That is not yet.
[946.48 → 949.34] Go over to the piano.
[949.34 → 977.02] Let's sing together.

[1184.00 → 1185.16] To the Book of Genesis
[1185.16 → 1186.40] The first book of the Bible
[1186.40 → 1190.60] And we'll read a shorter passage
[1190.60 → 1193.20] In Genesis chapter 17
[1193.20 → 1200.20] So on page 11
[1200.20 → 1201.52] In your pew Bible
[1201.52 → 1202.20] Page 11
[1202.20 → 1210.90] Genesis chapter 17
[1210.90 → 1212.82] And I'm just going to read
[1212.82 → 1213.82] To verse 8
[1213.82 → 1215.90] Verses 1 through 8
[1215.90 → 1222.08] When Abram was 99 years old
[1222.08 → 1224.76] The Lord appeared to him
[1224.76 → 1225.80] And said
[1225.80 → 1227.78] I am God Almighty
[1227.78 → 1229.56] Walk before me
[1229.56 → 1230.72] And be blameless
[1230.72 → 1233.62] I will confirm my covenant
[1233.62 → 1235.26] Between me and you
[1235.26 → 1237.84] And will greatly increase your numbers
[1237.84 → 1240.74] Abram fell face down
[1240.74 → 1242.04] And God said to him
[1242.04 → 1243.60] As for me
[1243.60 → 1245.42] This is my covenant with you
[1245.42 → 1248.40] You will be the father of many nations
[1248.40 → 1251.16] No longer will you be called Abram
[1251.16 → 1253.52] Your name will be Abraham
[1253.52 → 1257.04] For I have made you a father of many nations
[1257.04 → 1259.54] I will make you very fruitful
[1259.54 → 1261.82] I will make nations of you
[1261.82 → 1263.70] And kings will come from you
[1263.70 → 1265.48] I will establish my covenant
[1265.48 → 1267.06] As an everlasting covenant
[1267.06 → 1269.66] Between me and you
[1269.66 → 1271.76] And your descendants after you
[1271.76 → 1273.56] For the generations to come
[1273.56 → 1275.34] To be your God
[1275.34 → 1277.50] And the God of your descendants
[1277.50 → 1278.32] After you
[1278.32 → 1280.28] The whole land of Canaan
[1280.28 → 1281.60] Where you are now
[1281.60 → 1282.18] An alien
[1282.18 → 1283.54] I will give
[1283.54 → 1285.64] As an everlasting possession to you
[1285.64 → 1287.66] And your descendants after you
[1287.66 → 1289.96] And I will be their God
[1289.96 → 1292.08] This is the word of the Lord
[1292.08 → 1296.58] Now one of the things that happens
[1296.58 → 1297.92] When we worship God
[1297.92 → 1299.12] Is that we realize
[1299.12 → 1300.40] We need a saviour
[1300.40 → 1301.88] We need a saviour
[1301.88 → 1303.18] In order to worship him
[1303.18 → 1305.30] And to come before his holy presence
[1305.30 → 1307.32] Because we realize
[1307.32 → 1308.34] That we cannot keep
[1308.34 → 1310.24] God's laws and his commandments
[1310.24 → 1311.30] Not perfectly
[1311.30 → 1313.74] Certainly not all the time
[1313.74 → 1317.72] Not both inside in our hearts
[1317.72 → 1320.18] And outside in our lives
[1320.18 → 1322.18] You know we fail to do
[1322.18 → 1324.02] What we were created to do
[1324.02 → 1325.62] Which is to give glory to God
[1325.62 → 1327.12] And all that we think and say and do
[1327.12 → 1329.72] And so we come to a time now
[1329.72 → 1330.36] Of confession
[1330.36 → 1331.50] Acknowledging that
[1331.50 → 1332.48] We need
[1332.48 → 1333.84] To be forgiven
[1333.84 → 1336.28] That we need to be made whole
[1336.28 → 1338.58] And, so I want to invite you
[1338.58 → 1339.94] To join me in a prayer of confession
[1339.94 → 1341.60] I'll lead us in prayer first
[1341.60 → 1342.68] And then I will give you
[1342.68 → 1344.06] Some moments afterwards
[1344.06 → 1345.02] To silently
[1345.02 → 1347.20] Confess your sins
[1347.20 → 1347.70] Personally
[1347.70 → 1350.02] To the Lord
[1350.02 → 1351.50] So please join me
[1351.50 → 1352.52] In a prayer of confession
[1352.52 → 1356.42] God of love
[1356.42 → 1357.58] God of justice
[1357.58 → 1359.12] We long
[1359.12 → 1360.88] For peace
[1360.88 → 1362.48] We long for peace
[1362.48 → 1362.84] Within
[1362.84 → 1364.72] And peace without
[1364.72 → 1367.36] We long for harmony
[1367.36 → 1368.28] In our minds
[1368.28 → 1369.36] And our hearts
[1369.36 → 1371.82] We long for harmony
[1371.82 → 1372.66] In our families
[1372.66 → 1374.02] And in our churches
[1374.02 → 1376.68] In our cities
[1376.68 → 1378.12] In our workplaces
[1378.12 → 1380.30] We long for the day
[1380.30 → 1381.24] When all of these
[1381.24 → 1382.92] All these places
[1382.92 → 1383.70] Will be
[1383.70 → 1385.10] A dwelling place
[1385.10 → 1385.78] For your love
[1385.78 → 1388.08] And yet we confess
[1388.08 → 1389.08] That we are often
[1389.08 → 1389.92] Anxious
[1389.92 → 1391.62] We are often
[1391.62 → 1393.02] Self-seeking
[1393.02 → 1394.62] And we harbour
[1394.62 → 1395.36] Animosity
[1395.36 → 1396.10] Towards others
[1396.10 → 1397.76] We're not willing
[1397.76 → 1398.90] To take the risks
[1398.90 → 1401.64] And to make the sacrifices
[1401.64 → 1404.02] That love requires
[1404.02 → 1406.36] So look upon us Lord
[1406.36 → 1407.06] With your kindness
[1407.06 → 1407.78] And your grace
[1407.78 → 1409.20] Would you rule
[1409.20 → 1410.16] In our hearts
[1410.16 → 1411.12] As king
[1411.12 → 1412.98] And in all the world
[1412.98 → 1414.68] Lord show us
[1414.68 → 1415.40] How to walk
[1415.40 → 1416.20] In your ways
[1416.20 → 1417.62] Through the mercy
[1417.62 → 1418.36] Of our saviour
[1418.36 → 1419.44] We pray
[1419.44 → 1420.28] Amen
[1437.78 → 1466.58] So hear now these words
[1466.58 → 1467.08] Of assurance
[1467.08 → 1467.14] Of assurance
[1467.14 → 1467.86] That come to us
[1467.86 → 1468.70] From psalm 103
[1468.70 → 1470.74] Verses 8 to 12
[1470.74 → 1472.08] And I'll begin
[1472.08 → 1472.68] And then there'll be
[1472.68 → 1473.58] A responsive part
[1473.58 → 1475.56] The Lord is compassionate
[1475.56 → 1476.20] And gracious
[1476.20 → 1477.84] Slow to anger
[1477.84 → 1479.12] Abounding in love
[1479.12 → 1480.84] He will not always
[1480.84 → 1480.96] Accuses
[1480.96 → 1483.14] Nor will he harbour
[1483.14 → 1484.00] His anger forever
[1484.00 → 1485.62] He does not treat us
[1485.62 → 1486.82] As our sins deserve
[1486.82 → 1488.40] Or repay us
[1488.40 → 1489.84] According to our
[1489.84 → 1490.70] Iniquities
[1490.70 → 1491.34] Together
[1491.34 → 1493.02] For as high
[1493.02 → 1493.82] As the heavens
[1493.82 → 1495.22] Are above the earth
[1495.22 → 1496.54] So great
[1496.54 → 1497.60] Is his love
[1497.60 → 1498.34] For those
[1498.34 → 1499.08] Who fear him
[1499.08 → 1500.30] As far
[1500.30 → 1501.22] As the east
[1501.22 → 1502.28] Is from the west
[1502.28 → 1503.62] So far
[1503.62 → 1504.72] Has he removed
[1504.72 → 1506.08] Our transgressions
[1506.08 → 1507.08] From us
[1507.08 → 1508.96] Praise be to God
[1508.96 → 1510.34] So in response
[1510.34 → 1511.18] To God's love
[1511.18 → 1511.80] This assurance
[1511.80 → 1512.36] Of his pardon
[1512.36 → 1513.04] Let's all stand
[1513.04 → 1514.46] And we will sing
[1514.46 → 1515.86] A few more songs
[1515.86 → 1517.58] As we continue
[1517.58 → 1518.20] To worship God
[1547.58 → 1548.14] God's love
[1548.14 → 1548.98] For those
[1548.98 → 1551.46] All that
[1551.46 → 1554.86] Be on no measure
[1554.86 → 1558.10] That he should
[1558.10 → 1561.42] Give his early time
[1561.42 → 1564.42] To make the riches
[1564.42 → 1566.42] richer
[1566.42 → 1570.14] How great the pain
[1570.14 → 1573.04] Of searing loss
[1573.04 → 1575.72] The Father turns
[1575.72 → 1578.56] His praise away
[1578.56 → 1580.56] As hosts
[1580.56 → 1584.30] Which are the chosen one
[1584.30 → 1586.98] Take many sons
[1586.98 → 1589.04] To glory
[1589.04 → 1598.30] Behold the man
[1598.30 → 1600.96] Of God our God
[1600.96 → 1605.46] I sing upon his shoulders
[1605.46 → 1609.34] Ashamed I hear
[1609.34 → 1612.20] My longing voice
[1612.20 → 1616.78] But among the small
[1616.78 → 1617.94] First
[1617.94 → 1619.96] It was
[1619.96 → 1623.44] Was he that held in prayer
[1623.44 → 1628.26] Until it was accomplished
[1628.26 → 1631.54] His time
[1631.54 → 1635.26] And it is finished
[1635.26 → 1636.14] His time
[1636.14 → 1640.50] And it is finished
[1640.50 → 1651.00] I will not boast in anything
[1651.00 → 1653.48] For this
[1653.48 → 1653.50] For this
[1653.50 → 1662.94] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1662.94 → 1667.46] His death and resurrection
[1667.46 → 1673.56] Why should I be from this reward?
[1674.74 → 1679.06] I cannot give an answer
[1679.06 → 1685.68] But this final end of my heart
[1685.68 → 1690.44] His wounds have made my rest
[1697.46 → 1727.44] I cannot give an answer
[1727.46 → 1744.42] Amazing grace, how sweet the song
[1744.42 → 1751.46] That saved a rest like me
[1751.46 → 1759.46] I was, was lost, but now I'm found
[1760.30 → 1767.46] Was blind, but now I see
[1767.46 → 1775.46] T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1776.00 → 1782.46] And grace my fears relieved
[1782.46 → 1788.46] The blessings of God
[1788.46 → 1790.46] The grace of God
[1790.46 → 1796.46] The hour I first believe
[1796.46 → 1801.46] My sins are gone
[1801.46 → 1804.46] Love to save me
[1804.46 → 1808.46] My God, my Saviour
[1808.46 → 1812.46] Has blessed me
[1812.46 → 1816.46] Like a flood
[1816.46 → 1820.46] His mercy brings
[1820.46 → 1824.46] Unending love
[1824.46 → 1828.46] Amazing grace
[1828.46 → 1836.46] The Lord has promised me to me
[1836.46 → 1848.46] The Lord has promised me to me
[1848.46 → 1854.46] Discard my heart to close
[1854.46 → 1860.46] I'll fill my shield
[1860.46 → 1864.46] And worship me
[1864.46 → 1870.46] As long as I can choose
[1870.46 → 1872.46] The Lord has promised me
[1872.46 → 1874.46] In the name of God
[1874.46 → 1876.46] In the name of God
[1876.46 → 1878.46] His sinners
[1878.46 → 1880.46] His mercy brings
[1880.46 → 1882.46] The Lord has promised me
[1882.46 → 1886.46] But now I'm met
[1886.46 → 1900.46] His grace has brought His change thus far, and grace will lead me home.
[1900.46 → 1917.10] is
[1917.10 → 1920.36] Like a prize
[1920.36 → 1924.08] His mercy bears
[1924.08 → 1927.92] Unending life
[1927.92 → 1929.60] But capitalize
[1929.60 → 1950.80] When we've been there ten thousand years
[1950.80 → 1956.48] Our tiny nest of star
[1956.48 → 1965.48] The glory is risen to see God's grace
[1966.02 → 1971.48] And when we have first begun
[1971.48 → 1976.48] Amen
[1986.48 → 1989.58] Good singing everyone
[1989.58 → 1990.88] That was great
[1990.88 → 1991.88] That was nice to listen to
[1991.88 → 1993.52] The children
[1993.52 → 1995.80] Teachers assistants are now
[1995.80 → 1997.86] Dismissed to go to their classes
[1997.86 → 2008.26] And you can turn with me in the book of Romans
[2008.26 → 2016.44] And we have been working our way
[2016.44 → 2018.18] Through the book of Romans
[2018.18 → 2020.90] And today we're in chapter 4
[2020.90 → 2022.20] We'll be reading
[2022.20 → 2025.28] From verse 13
[2025.28 → 2027.16] To the end of the chapter
[2027.16 → 2028.78] Romans chapter 4
[2028.78 → 2031.04] Beginning in verse 13
[2031.04 → 2032.26] That's on page 839
[2032.88 → 2033.94] In your pew bible
[2033.94 → 2035.04] If you'd like to follow along there
[2035.04 → 2035.78] Or on the screen
[2035.78 → 2039.46] And we read the scriptures first
[2039.46 → 2041.14] Because we believe that is where
[2041.14 → 2042.62] The treasure is
[2042.62 → 2043.00] Right?
[2043.08 → 2043.66] In God's word
[2043.66 → 2047.38] And so
[2047.38 → 2048.60] Let's give our attention
[2048.60 → 2049.66] To the reading of God's word
[2049.66 → 2052.52] It was not through the law
[2052.52 → 2053.18] That Abraham
[2053.18 → 2054.46] And his offspring
[2054.46 → 2055.98] Received the promise
[2055.98 → 2058.14] That he would be heir of the world
[2058.14 → 2059.72] But through the righteousness
[2059.72 → 2061.04] That comes by faith
[2061.04 → 2063.60] For if those who live by law
[2063.60 → 2065.36] Are heirs
[2065.36 → 2066.78] Faith has no value
[2066.78 → 2067.96] And the promise is worthless
[2067.96 → 2070.60] Because law brings wrath
[2070.60 → 2072.14] And where there is no law
[2072.14 → 2073.28] There is no transgression
[2073.28 → 2076.30] Therefore the promise comes by faith
[2076.30 → 2078.68] So that it may be by grace
[2078.68 → 2080.10] And may be guaranteed
[2080.10 → 2082.16] To all Abraham's offspring
[2082.16 → 2084.04] Not only to those who are
[2084.04 → 2085.04] Of the law
[2085.04 → 2086.52] But also to those who are
[2086.52 → 2087.96] Of the faith of Abraham
[2087.96 → 2090.28] He is the father of us all
[2090.28 → 2091.80] As it is written
[2091.80 → 2092.96] I have made you
[2092.96 → 2094.46] A father of many nations
[2094.46 → 2096.34] He is our father
[2096.34 → 2097.30] In the sight of God
[2097.30 → 2099.00] In whom he believed
[2099.00 → 2100.56] The God who gives life
[2100.56 → 2101.16] To the dead
[2101.16 → 2102.92] And calls things that are not
[2102.92 → 2104.40] As though they were
[2104.40 → 2106.56] Against all hope
[2106.56 → 2107.76] Abraham in hope
[2107.76 → 2108.54] Believed
[2108.54 → 2109.86] And so became
[2109.86 → 2111.38] The father of many nations
[2111.38 → 2113.68] Just as it has been said
[2113.68 → 2114.22] To him
[2114.22 → 2116.34] So shall your offspring be
[2116.34 → 2118.04] Without weakening
[2118.04 → 2118.84] In his faith
[2118.84 → 2119.98] He faced the fact
[2119.98 → 2120.88] That his body
[2120.88 → 2122.06] Was as good as dead
[2122.06 → 2123.24] Since he was about
[2123.24 → 2124.10] A hundred years old
[2124.10 → 2125.64] And that Sarah's womb
[2125.64 → 2126.44] Was also dead
[2126.44 → 2129.28] Yet he did not waver
[2129.28 → 2130.42] Through unbelief
[2130.42 → 2131.64] Regarding the promise
[2131.64 → 2132.22] Of God
[2132.22 → 2133.52] But was strengthened
[2133.52 → 2134.34] In his faith
[2134.34 → 2136.00] And gave glory to God
[2136.00 → 2137.70] Being fully persuaded
[2137.70 → 2139.52] That God had power
[2139.52 → 2142.66] To do what he had promised
[2142.66 → 2144.36] This is why
[2144.36 → 2145.80] It was credited
[2145.80 → 2146.76] To him
[2146.76 → 2147.38] As righteousness
[2147.38 → 2149.14] The words
[2149.14 → 2149.96] It was credited
[2149.96 → 2150.48] To him
[2150.48 → 2150.88] Were written
[2150.88 → 2151.94] Not for him alone
[2151.94 → 2153.52] But also for us
[2153.52 → 2154.60] To whom God
[2154.60 → 2155.66] Will credit righteousness
[2155.66 → 2157.06] For us
[2157.06 → 2158.10] Who believe in him
[2158.10 → 2159.34] Who raised
[2159.34 → 2160.26] Jesus our Lord
[2160.26 → 2160.92] From the dead
[2160.92 → 2162.20] He was delivered
[2162.20 → 2163.50] Over to death
[2163.50 → 2164.44] For our sins
[2164.44 → 2165.70] And was raised
[2165.70 → 2166.34] To life
[2166.34 → 2168.50] For our justification
[2168.50 → 2170.02] This is the word
[2170.02 → 2170.50] Of the Lord
[2170.50 → 2173.38] And I must say
[2173.38 → 2174.32] There is not much
[2174.32 → 2175.70] That ever has been written
[2175.70 → 2177.26] That is more profound
[2177.26 → 2178.38] And mysterious
[2178.38 → 2178.90] Than that
[2178.90 → 2181.50] But let's ask the Lord
[2181.50 → 2182.52] To first bless
[2182.52 → 2184.84] His word to us
[2184.84 → 2185.86] Okay so would you
[2185.86 → 2186.76] Would you join me in prayer
[2186.76 → 2190.04] Our Father we ask
[2190.04 → 2191.10] Lord that you would
[2191.10 → 2191.78] Bless your word
[2191.78 → 2192.64] To our souls
[2192.64 → 2193.24] This morning
[2193.24 → 2195.38] Lord by your Holy Spirit
[2195.38 → 2196.04] Would you open
[2196.04 → 2197.10] Our hearts
[2197.10 → 2198.06] That we may be filled
[2198.06 → 2198.88] With your truth
[2198.88 → 2200.94] And that being filled
[2200.94 → 2202.00] We might be empowered
[2202.00 → 2203.80] To live out your truth
[2203.80 → 2205.30] In our Christian walks
[2205.30 → 2206.88] All to the praise
[2206.88 → 2207.80] Of your glorious name
[2207.80 → 2208.76] Amen
[2208.76 → 2213.44] So if you were to
[2213.44 → 2213.92] Google
[2213.92 → 2215.94] As I may have done

[2229.48 → 2230.06] Their thoughts
[2230.06 → 2230.66] And opinions

[2253.82 → 2254.32] Are familiar
[2254.32 → 2254.82] With this song
[2254.82 → 2255.44] I Believe
[2255.44 → 2256.90] I wasn't here then
[2256.90 → 2258.52] But it was apparently
[2258.52 → 2261.80] Quite an important song
[2261.80 → 2263.28] For these winter games
[2263.28 → 2264.46] But here are a few lines
[2264.46 → 2265.10] Of the chorus
[2265.10 → 2267.32] She sings
[2267.32 → 2267.96] Is it there?
[2269.04 → 2269.22] Okay
[2269.22 → 2269.56] I don't
[2269.56 → 2269.98] Yeah
[2269.98 → 2272.74] I believe together
[2272.74 → 2273.40] We'll fly
[2273.40 → 2274.64] I believe in the power
[2274.64 → 2275.86] Of you and I
[2275.86 → 2277.90] Aside from
[2277.90 → 2278.76] As some
[2278.76 → 2280.48] Reporters have pointed out
[2280.48 → 2281.46] The grammatically
[2281.46 → 2282.58] Incorrect language
[2282.58 → 2285.22] But what is this song about?
[2286.50 → 2287.60] It's saying that faith
[2287.60 → 2288.70] Is believing
[2288.70 → 2289.86] In one another
[2289.86 → 2290.70] Right
[2290.70 → 2291.74] Believing in humanity
[2291.74 → 2292.30] And of course
[2292.30 → 2293.36] That's a great message
[2293.36 → 2294.84] For you know
[2294.84 → 2295.58] Especially during
[2295.58 → 2296.44] The Olympic Games
[2296.44 → 2296.70] Right
[2296.70 → 2297.12] That kind of
[2297.12 → 2297.82] Warms the heart
[2297.82 → 2300.90] Now here is another one
[2300.90 → 2302.34] It's a quote from
[2302.34 → 2304.04] Nipsey Hassle
[2304.04 → 2305.54] Who is a famous
[2305.54 → 2306.26] Rap artist
[2306.26 → 2306.86] Anybody know
[2306.86 → 2307.44] This name?
[2308.58 → 2308.78] Ellie?
[2309.54 → 2310.10] No?
[2310.42 → 2310.68] Okay
[2310.68 → 2311.56] Well
[2311.56 → 2314.30] This is what he says
[2314.30 → 2315.64] You've got to have faith
[2315.64 → 2316.56] In what you're doing
[2316.56 → 2318.06] And not take any
[2318.06 → 2318.70] For an answer
[2318.70 → 2320.92] So what is faith?
[2321.08 → 2321.86] Well faith is
[2321.86 → 2323.14] Believing in yourself
[2323.14 → 2325.48] And then
[2325.48 → 2326.52] As you're googling
[2326.52 → 2327.18] These things
[2327.18 → 2327.78] All of a sudden
[2327.78 → 2328.64] You get a quote
[2328.64 → 2329.36] From Martin Luther
[2329.36 → 2330.42] You know
[2330.42 → 2330.94] And so here's
[2330.94 → 2331.86] What Martin Luther said
[2331.86 → 2333.42] Faith is living
[2333.42 → 2334.78] Is a living
[2334.78 → 2336.38] Daring confidence
[2336.38 → 2337.30] In God's grace
[2337.30 → 2340.14] Now what I found
[2340.14 → 2340.70] Interesting
[2340.70 → 2341.72] Is that everyone
[2341.72 → 2343.12] Thinks they know
[2343.12 → 2343.92] What it means
[2343.92 → 2344.68] To have faith
[2344.68 → 2345.90] And yet
[2345.90 → 2346.62] Everyone also
[2346.62 → 2347.66] Disagrees with each other
[2347.66 → 2349.72] So who gets
[2349.72 → 2350.60] To define
[2350.60 → 2351.26] Faith?
[2352.46 → 2352.98] Right
[2352.98 → 2353.62] Is faith
[2353.62 → 2354.34] Believing in the
[2354.34 → 2355.38] Power of you and me?
[2356.08 → 2356.68] As Nikki
[2356.68 → 2357.90] Panofsky has said
[2357.90 → 2359.68] Is faith
[2359.68 → 2361.14] Believing in yourself?
[2361.76 → 2363.04] As Nipsey Hassle said
[2363.04 → 2365.12] Or is faith
[2365.12 → 2365.62] A living
[2365.62 → 2366.84] Daring confidence
[2366.84 → 2367.56] In God's grace?
[2368.34 → 2369.40] As Martin Luther said
[2369.40 → 2371.44] Now the reason
[2371.44 → 2372.46] This question is important
[2372.46 → 2374.08] Is that Paul
[2374.08 → 2374.88] Has been arguing
[2374.88 → 2375.80] That we receive
[2375.80 → 2376.34] The righteousness
[2376.34 → 2376.98] Of God
[2376.98 → 2378.68] By faith
[2378.68 → 2379.90] Right
[2379.90 → 2381.24] We lay hold
[2381.24 → 2382.56] Of God's
[2382.56 → 2383.58] Promises
[2383.58 → 2385.22] Or a relationship
[2385.22 → 2385.94] With God
[2385.94 → 2387.96] By faith
[2387.96 → 2389.64] So then the question is
[2389.64 → 2390.78] What does that mean?
[2391.54 → 2392.94] What is true faith?
[2393.60 → 2394.56] And that's what I want
[2394.56 → 2395.36] To look at this morning
[2395.36 → 2396.66] And in our passage
[2396.66 → 2398.30] Paul returns
[2398.30 → 2399.44] To the story of Abraham
[2399.44 → 2401.40] And he does that
[2401.40 → 2402.02] To show us
[2402.02 → 2403.04] What faith looks like
[2403.04 → 2404.78] He looks to Abraham
[2404.78 → 2405.42] To show us
[2405.42 → 2406.38] What true faith
[2406.38 → 2407.80] Is like
[2407.80 → 2408.44] What it does
[2408.44 → 2410.04] And, so I have two things
[2410.04 → 2411.06] I want to point out to us
[2411.06 → 2412.12] That centre around
[2412.12 → 2413.16] This question of
[2413.16 → 2414.64] What do we learn about faith
[2414.64 → 2415.66] From this passage?
[2416.12 → 2416.76] And so first
[2416.76 → 2417.50] We're going to look at
[2417.50 → 2418.90] The promises of God
[2418.90 → 2420.32] And then secondly
[2420.32 → 2421.72] The power of God
[2421.72 → 2422.46] Just two points
[2422.46 → 2423.58] The promises of God
[2423.58 → 2425.08] The power of God
[2425.08 → 2426.38] And then we will
[2426.38 → 2428.22] Talk about a few points
[2428.22 → 2428.88] Of application
[2428.88 → 2430.48] So get ready for that
[2430.48 → 2432.84] So the first
[2432.84 → 2434.40] Firstly
[2434.40 → 2435.40] True faith
[2435.40 → 2436.62] According to the Bible
[2436.62 → 2438.86] Is about holding on
[2438.86 → 2439.84] To the promises
[2439.84 → 2440.68] Of God
[2440.68 → 2441.92] In fact
[2441.92 → 2442.90] The key to understanding
[2442.90 → 2443.48] This passage
[2443.48 → 2444.00] I would
[2444.00 → 2445.40] Submit to us
[2445.40 → 2447.22] Is that link
[2447.22 → 2447.88] Between
[2447.88 → 2449.14] Our faith
[2449.14 → 2450.66] And God's promises
[2450.66 → 2451.84] Okay
[2451.84 → 2452.80] God makes promises
[2452.80 → 2453.76] We respond
[2453.76 → 2454.76] In faith
[2454.76 → 2456.22] That's the relationship
[2456.22 → 2457.56] So let's look first
[2457.56 → 2459.08] At verse 13
[2459.08 → 2459.72] In our passage
[2459.72 → 2460.44] The first verse
[2460.44 → 2461.64] Paul writes this
[2461.64 → 2463.32] It was not through the law
[2463.32 → 2463.92] That Abraham
[2463.92 → 2464.98] In his offspring
[2464.98 → 2466.42] Received the promise
[2466.42 → 2467.58] That he would be
[2467.58 → 2468.26] Heir of the world
[2468.26 → 2469.68] But through the righteousness
[2469.68 → 2470.70] That comes by
[2470.70 → 2471.70] Faith
[2471.70 → 2472.88] So you see those
[2472.88 → 2473.68] Two keywords there
[2473.68 → 2473.86] Right?
[2474.00 → 2474.50] Promise
[2474.50 → 2476.32] Received by faith
[2476.32 → 2478.54] So Paul here
[2478.54 → 2479.28] Is picking up
[2479.28 → 2480.14] On what he has been
[2480.14 → 2480.84] Talking about
[2480.84 → 2481.80] For quite a bit
[2481.80 → 2483.16] He's been talking
[2483.16 → 2484.26] About righteousness
[2484.26 → 2485.36] The righteousness of God
[2485.36 → 2485.94] He's been talking
[2485.94 → 2487.22] About justification
[2487.22 → 2489.04] This has been his focus
[2489.04 → 2490.94] And he says
[2490.94 → 2493.08] The righteousness of God
[2493.08 → 2494.80] Is offered to us
[2494.80 → 2495.96] Through the form
[2495.96 → 2496.82] Of a promise
[2496.82 → 2499.54] And we take hold
[2499.54 → 2501.24] Of that promise of God
[2501.24 → 2502.36] By faith
[2502.36 → 2505.46] So then Paul uses
[2505.46 → 2506.78] The example of Abraham
[2506.78 → 2509.00] As this perfect example
[2509.00 → 2510.44] And Abraham
[2510.44 → 2511.66] As we know
[2511.66 → 2512.40] In the Bible
[2512.40 → 2513.66] Is very important
[2513.66 → 2515.88] And when we first
[2515.88 → 2516.66] Meet Abraham
[2516.66 → 2517.36] You know as
[2517.36 → 2518.08] Last week
[2518.08 → 2518.46] This week
[2518.46 → 2519.06] We've read from
[2519.06 → 2519.82] Genesis 12
[2519.82 → 2521.00] 15-17
[2521.00 → 2522.08] Kind of looking
[2522.08 → 2522.96] At his story a bit
[2522.96 → 2524.08] Well
[2524.08 → 2525.62] When we first meet him
[2525.62 → 2526.64] He was a
[2526.64 → 2528.26] A moon worshipper
[2528.26 → 2529.42] Essentially
[2529.42 → 2529.82] Remember
[2529.82 → 2530.88] He was a Gentile
[2530.88 → 2532.20] He had never heard
[2532.20 → 2532.58] Of the God
[2532.58 → 2533.04] Of the Bible
[2533.04 → 2534.58] One day
[2534.58 → 2535.96] God comes to Abraham
[2535.96 → 2537.58] In the land of Your
[2537.58 → 2538.80] In Mesopotamia
[2538.80 → 2540.40] And speaks to him
[2540.40 → 2541.66] Reveals himself to him
[2541.66 → 2542.78] And promises him
[2542.78 → 2543.94] To bless him
[2543.94 → 2544.50] With children
[2544.50 → 2545.80] And to make him
[2545.80 → 2546.30] The father
[2546.30 → 2547.82] Of many nations
[2547.82 → 2549.46] And Abraham
[2549.46 → 2551.02] Believed
[2551.02 → 2552.16] God's promise
[2552.16 → 2552.84] Even though
[2552.84 → 2553.58] What God promised
[2553.58 → 2554.26] Was totally
[2554.26 → 2555.30] Humanly
[2555.30 → 2556.22] Impossible
[2556.22 → 2558.26] Why was it impossible?
[2558.44 → 2559.24] Because Abraham
[2559.24 → 2560.34] Was already an old man
[2560.34 → 2561.94] His wife Sarah
[2561.94 → 2562.70] Was unable
[2562.70 → 2563.46] To have a child
[2563.46 → 2566.24] But as Paul says
[2566.24 → 2566.82] The promise
[2566.82 → 2567.62] That God made
[2567.62 → 2568.12] To Abraham
[2568.12 → 2568.88] In his offspring
[2568.88 → 2570.24] That he would be
[2570.24 → 2571.26] The heir of the world
[2571.26 → 2572.72] Was not received
[2572.72 → 2573.56] Through the law
[2573.56 → 2574.66] But through the
[2574.66 → 2575.36] Righteousness
[2575.36 → 2575.98] Of faith
[2575.98 → 2577.46] And so God
[2577.46 → 2578.66] Made a specific
[2578.66 → 2580.80] Particular promise
[2580.80 → 2582.22] And Abraham
[2582.22 → 2583.44] Believed that God
[2583.44 → 2584.36] Was as good
[2584.36 → 2585.48] As his word
[2585.48 → 2587.34] That God
[2587.34 → 2587.36] And God
[2587.36 → 2588.40] Then counted
[2588.40 → 2589.92] That faith
[2589.92 → 2590.68] To Abraham
[2590.68 → 2592.30] As righteousness
[2592.30 → 2594.46] And what that means
[2594.46 → 2595.26] Is Abraham
[2595.26 → 2597.24] Brings nothing
[2597.24 → 2598.58] Of his own
[2598.58 → 2599.40] To this equation
[2599.40 → 2601.40] He doesn't
[2601.40 → 2603.54] Deserve this promise
[2603.54 → 2606.14] It's beyond
[2606.14 → 2606.90] His power
[2606.90 → 2608.06] To achieve this promise
[2608.06 → 2608.38] Right
[2608.38 → 2609.00] He
[2609.00 → 2610.50] He does nothing
[2610.50 → 2611.88] He just receives it
[2611.88 → 2612.70] And yet God
[2612.70 → 2613.84] Counts him
[2613.84 → 2614.68] As righteous
[2614.68 → 2616.74] Because he believes
[2616.74 → 2617.86] Because he
[2617.86 → 2619.76] Receives this
[2619.76 → 2620.52] Free promise
[2620.52 → 2620.98] Of God
[2620.98 → 2623.10] That God
[2623.10 → 2623.70] Would do
[2623.70 → 2624.74] As God
[2624.74 → 2626.10] Promised to do
[2626.10 → 2628.12] And friends
[2628.12 → 2628.88] It's exactly
[2628.88 → 2629.38] The same
[2629.38 → 2629.94] For us
[2629.94 → 2632.14] Faith is the way
[2632.14 → 2633.56] Of receiving
[2633.56 → 2634.54] Not achieving
[2634.54 → 2635.04] You've probably
[2635.04 → 2635.60] Heard that before
[2635.60 → 2636.92] Faith is receiving
[2636.92 → 2637.94] Not achieving
[2637.94 → 2639.20] It receives
[2639.20 → 2640.20] What God
[2640.20 → 2641.08] Has promised
[2641.08 → 2643.40] So then Paul
[2643.40 → 2644.02] Goes on
[2644.02 → 2644.70] To say that
[2644.70 → 2645.52] The opposite
[2645.52 → 2646.40] Of faith
[2646.40 → 2647.92] At least in this
[2647.92 → 2648.50] Passage
[2648.50 → 2649.60] Is not
[2649.60 → 2650.60] Unbelief
[2650.60 → 2652.26] But it's
[2652.26 → 2653.34] Depending on the law
[2653.34 → 2654.22] That's the opposite
[2654.22 → 2654.62] Of faith
[2654.62 → 2655.36] Not unbelief
[2655.36 → 2656.70] But working
[2656.70 → 2657.86] So look with me
[2657.86 → 2658.64] At verse 14
[2658.64 → 2660.18] He says
[2660.18 → 2661.40] For if those
[2661.40 → 2661.98] Who depend
[2661.98 → 2662.62] On the law
[2662.62 → 2663.28] Are heirs
[2663.28 → 2664.32] Faith means nothing
[2664.32 → 2665.00] The promise
[2665.00 → 2665.50] Is worthless
[2665.50 → 2667.44] Okay so
[2667.44 → 2668.10] Paul's reminding
[2668.10 → 2668.64] His readers
[2668.64 → 2669.90] That receiving
[2669.90 → 2670.44] The righteousness
[2670.44 → 2671.06] Of God
[2671.06 → 2671.76] Doesn't happen
[2671.76 → 2672.50] Through the law
[2672.50 → 2674.02] Through our works
[2674.02 → 2674.96] Through our doing
[2674.96 → 2676.72] Because the law
[2676.72 → 2677.38] Tells us
[2677.38 → 2679.54] What we must do
[2679.54 → 2681.12] And we respond
[2681.12 → 2682.38] In works
[2682.38 → 2683.88] But the promise
[2683.88 → 2684.46] Of God
[2684.46 → 2684.96] Tells us
[2684.96 → 2685.52] What God
[2685.52 → 2686.18] Will do
[2686.18 → 2687.82] And we respond
[2687.82 → 2688.34] In faith
[2688.34 → 2689.06] Right
[2689.06 → 2689.82] We respond
[2689.82 → 2691.04] By receiving
[2691.04 → 2692.38] God's righteousness
[2692.38 → 2695.86] Now Paul
[2695.86 → 2696.80] Is not trying
[2696.80 → 2697.46] To make us
[2697.46 → 2698.18] Lazy
[2698.18 → 2698.96] Christians
[2698.96 → 2700.34] He's not
[2700.34 → 2700.78] Trying to make
[2700.78 → 2701.00] Us
[2701.00 → 2701.88] Just passive
[2701.88 → 2703.40] And you know
[2703.40 → 2704.36] Detached
[2704.36 → 2705.32] Christians
[2705.32 → 2706.46] Who are not
[2706.46 → 2707.34] Interested in works
[2707.34 → 2708.20] That's not the point
[2708.20 → 2710.46] Because true faith
[2710.46 → 2711.30] Once it has
[2711.30 → 2712.02] Grasped
[2712.02 → 2713.44] Onto Jesus Christ
[2713.44 → 2714.92] Always wants
[2714.92 → 2715.70] To please God
[2715.70 → 2716.58] Always wants
[2716.58 → 2717.12] To live
[2717.12 → 2717.68] For God
[2717.68 → 2718.30] In his glory
[2718.30 → 2718.82] In the world
[2718.82 → 2720.30] And so true faith
[2720.30 → 2721.50] Will always show
[2721.50 → 2722.66] Itself
[2722.66 → 2723.46] Express itself
[2723.46 → 2724.14] In good works
[2724.14 → 2725.78] It will express
[2725.78 → 2726.12] Itself
[2726.12 → 2726.60] In obedience
[2726.60 → 2727.06] To God
[2727.06 → 2727.94] Right
[2727.94 → 2728.78] And as James
[2728.78 → 2729.20] Writes
[2729.20 → 2729.98] Faith without
[2729.98 → 2730.44] Works
[2730.44 → 2731.36] Is dead
[2731.36 → 2733.92] But the point
[2733.92 → 2734.36] Is this
[2734.36 → 2734.90] That we are
[2734.90 → 2735.62] Declared
[2735.62 → 2736.74] 100%
[2736.74 → 2737.40] Righteous
[2737.40 → 2738.46] Apart from
[2738.46 → 2738.84] Works
[2738.84 → 2740.16] We've got
[2740.16 → 2740.56] To get
[2740.56 → 2741.12] The horse
[2741.12 → 2742.10] Before the cart
[2742.10 → 2744.12] So Paul
[2744.12 → 2744.64] Reminds us
[2744.64 → 2745.14] Again that
[2745.14 → 2745.72] We're not
[2745.72 → 2746.24] Saved through
[2746.24 → 2746.74] The law
[2746.74 → 2748.48] And in fact
[2748.48 → 2749.52] We can't
[2749.52 → 2750.22] Keep the law
[2750.22 → 2751.34] Not perfectly
[2751.34 → 2752.42] Right
[2752.42 → 2753.02] In our natural
[2753.02 → 2753.74] State of sin
[2753.74 → 2754.82] We are
[2754.82 → 2755.74] Lawbreakers
[2755.74 → 2756.84] We don't
[2756.84 → 2757.38] Love God
[2757.38 → 2757.78] We don't
[2757.78 → 2758.40] Love others
[2758.40 → 2759.22] As we should
[2759.22 → 2760.18] And so
[2760.18 → 2761.00] The law
[2761.00 → 2761.62] Only brings
[2761.62 → 2762.00] Wrath
[2762.00 → 2762.48] The law
[2762.48 → 2763.14] Only brings
[2763.14 → 2763.88] Condemnation
[2763.88 → 2764.32] As Paul
[2764.32 → 2764.68] Says in
[2764.68 → 2765.24] Verse 15
[2765.24 → 2767.08] So God
[2767.08 → 2767.38] Though
[2767.38 → 2768.38] Offers us
[2768.38 → 2769.30] The promise
[2769.30 → 2770.26] That we
[2770.26 → 2770.64] Can be
[2770.64 → 2771.14] Justified
[2771.14 → 2771.76] Before God
[2771.76 → 2773.06] That we
[2773.06 → 2773.54] Can be
[2773.54 → 2774.58] Forgiven
[2774.58 → 2775.20] Of our sins
[2775.20 → 2775.50] That we
[2775.50 → 2775.80] Can be
[2775.80 → 2776.18] Robed
[2776.18 → 2776.46] With the
[2776.46 → 2776.92] Righteousness
[2776.92 → 2777.50] Of Christ
[2777.50 → 2778.58] And we
[2778.58 → 2779.26] Take hold
[2779.26 → 2779.64] Of that
[2779.64 → 2780.16] Promise
[2780.16 → 2780.86] By faith
[2780.86 → 2781.82] Right
[2781.82 → 2782.18] Believing
[2782.18 → 2782.62] That God
[2782.62 → 2783.06] Can
[2783.06 → 2783.66] And that
[2783.66 → 2784.10] He will
[2784.10 → 2784.54] Do for
[2784.54 → 2784.76] Us
[2784.76 → 2785.12] What we
[2785.12 → 2785.98] Are unable
[2785.98 → 2786.38] To do
[2786.38 → 2787.12] For ourselves
[2787.12 → 2789.34] And what
[2789.34 → 2789.98] This means
[2789.98 → 2791.40] Is that
[2791.40 → 2792.16] True Christian
[2792.16 → 2792.52] Faith
[2792.52 → 2793.00] It doesn't
[2793.00 → 2793.60] Focus
[2793.60 → 2795.00] On anything
[2795.00 → 2795.60] In us
[2795.60 → 2795.90] At all
[2795.90 → 2797.20] It doesn't
[2797.20 → 2797.84] Look to
[2797.84 → 2798.22] Us
[2798.22 → 2798.54] It's not
[2798.54 → 2798.90] Believing
[2798.90 → 2799.60] In ourselves
[2799.60 → 2800.68] In any
[2800.68 → 2801.00] Way
[2801.00 → 2802.34] And this
[2802.34 → 2802.74] Is really
[2802.74 → 2803.42] Good news
[2803.42 → 2804.66] Why is it
[2804.66 → 2805.18] Good news
[2805.18 → 2806.74] Because we
[2806.74 → 2807.36] All wobble
[2807.36 → 2808.58] Right
[2808.58 → 2808.88] Don't we
[2808.88 → 2809.28] Wobble
[2809.28 → 2810.56] Right
[2810.56 → 2811.28] Our faith
[2811.28 → 2811.78] In God's
[2811.78 → 2812.36] Promises
[2812.36 → 2813.62] Goes up
[2813.62 → 2814.54] And it
[2814.54 → 2815.06] Goes down
[2815.06 → 2816.60] We all
[2816.60 → 2817.68] Fail to
[2817.68 → 2818.36] Live up
[2818.36 → 2818.88] To our
[2818.88 → 2819.28] Own
[2819.28 → 2820.18] Expectations
[2820.18 → 2821.04] Of ourselves
[2821.04 → 2822.34] Let alone
[2822.34 → 2823.02] God's
[2823.02 → 2823.82] Expectations
[2823.82 → 2824.72] For us
[2824.72 → 2826.52] And so
[2826.52 → 2827.36] The security
[2827.36 → 2828.22] The assurance
[2828.22 → 2828.84] Of the Christian
[2828.84 → 2829.32] Faith
[2829.32 → 2830.30] Is not
[2830.30 → 2831.10] How hard
[2831.10 → 2831.80] You believe
[2831.80 → 2833.10] How strong
[2833.10 → 2833.68] Your faith
[2833.68 → 2834.10] Is
[2834.10 → 2835.68] The security
[2835.68 → 2836.18] Of faith
[2836.18 → 2836.62] Is that it
[2836.62 → 2837.40] Holds on
[2837.40 → 2838.00] To the
[2838.00 → 2838.50] Promises
[2838.50 → 2838.98] Of God
[2838.98 → 2842.46] So now
[2842.46 → 2842.82] Let's move
[2842.82 → 2843.28] On to the
[2843.28 → 2843.98] Second point
[2843.98 → 2845.32] And the
[2845.32 → 2845.94] Second point
[2845.94 → 2846.50] Is very
[2846.50 → 2847.08] Simple
[2847.08 → 2847.82] And obvious
[2847.82 → 2848.88] And that
[2848.88 → 2849.38] Is faith
[2849.38 → 2849.84] Looks to
[2849.84 → 2850.44] The power
[2850.44 → 2850.96] Of God
[2850.96 → 2852.46] So what
[2852.46 → 2852.74] You know
[2852.74 → 2853.24] God makes
[2853.24 → 2854.00] These promises
[2854.00 → 2854.38] Right
[2854.38 → 2855.08] And
[2855.08 → 2856.58] What makes
[2856.58 → 2857.32] These promises
[2857.32 → 2858.30] Something that
[2858.30 → 2859.38] Is worthwhile
[2859.38 → 2860.70] For us to
[2860.70 → 2861.42] Put our faith
[2861.42 → 2861.78] And trust
[2861.78 → 2862.16] In
[2862.16 → 2863.18] Is because
[2863.18 → 2863.78] Of whom
[2863.78 → 2864.40] Who stands
[2864.40 → 2865.10] Behind
[2865.10 → 2866.22] Those promises
[2866.22 → 2868.86] So let's
[2868.86 → 2869.30] See how this
[2869.30 → 2869.74] Shows up
[2869.74 → 2870.42] In the text
[2870.42 → 2871.38] Would you
[2871.38 → 2871.94] Look with me
[2871.94 → 2872.70] At verse
[2872.70 → 2873.34] 17
[2873.34 → 2875.26] So what
[2875.26 → 2875.88] Did Abraham
[2875.88 → 2877.12] Know about
[2877.12 → 2877.82] Who God
[2877.82 → 2878.20] Is
[2878.20 → 2879.30] What did
[2879.30 → 2879.56] Abraham
[2879.56 → 2880.08] Know about
[2880.08 → 2880.70] God
[2880.70 → 2882.40] And because
[2882.40 → 2882.90] Of that
[2882.90 → 2883.68] Trusted in
[2883.68 → 2884.14] The promises
[2884.14 → 2884.64] Of God
[2884.64 → 2885.86] So he knew
[2885.86 → 2886.52] Abraham is
[2886.52 → 2886.78] This
[2886.78 → 2887.96] The God
[2887.96 → 2888.68] Who gives
[2888.68 → 2889.32] Life to
[2889.32 → 2889.84] The dead
[2889.84 → 2890.42] And calls
[2890.42 → 2891.06] Into being
[2891.06 → 2891.52] Things that
[2891.52 → 2891.92] Were not
[2891.92 → 2894.36] And so
[2894.36 → 2894.68] What that
[2894.68 → 2895.30] Means is
[2895.30 → 2895.92] Abraham's
[2895.92 → 2896.76] Faith in
[2896.76 → 2897.36] God to
[2897.36 → 2897.66] Give him
[2897.66 → 2898.24] A child
[2898.24 → 2899.00] Through that
[2899.00 → 2899.60] Child to
[2899.60 → 2900.04] Bless all
[2900.04 → 2900.42] The nations
[2900.42 → 2900.70] Of the
[2900.70 → 2900.98] Earth
[2900.98 → 2901.62] That was
[2901.62 → 2902.24] Rooted in
[2902.24 → 2902.72] A deeper
[2902.72 → 2903.22] Belief
[2903.22 → 2904.92] That God
[2904.92 → 2905.72] Can make
[2905.72 → 2906.28] Dead things
[2906.28 → 2906.60] Live
[2906.60 → 2908.26] That God
[2908.26 → 2908.66] Can make
[2908.66 → 2909.08] Something that
[2909.08 → 2910.04] Is non-existent
[2910.04 → 2911.36] And bring it
[2911.36 → 2912.20] Into existence
[2912.20 → 2913.92] So in other
[2913.92 → 2914.32] Words it
[2914.32 → 2914.72] Wasn't just
[2914.72 → 2915.24] Holding to
[2915.24 → 2915.90] This promise
[2915.90 → 2917.30] But underneath
[2917.30 → 2918.90] That belief
[2918.90 → 2919.86] Abraham was
[2919.86 → 2920.26] Looking to
[2920.26 → 2920.82] The power
[2920.82 → 2921.36] Of God
[2921.36 → 2922.34] Into the
[2922.34 → 2922.94] Character of
[2922.94 → 2923.10] God
[2923.10 → 2923.72] Who God
[2923.72 → 2924.12] Is
[2924.12 → 2926.74] So later
[2926.74 → 2927.58] In Abraham's
[2927.58 → 2927.98] Story
[2927.98 → 2929.02] God
[2929.02 → 2929.88] If you know
[2929.88 → 2930.46] Remember the
[2930.46 → 2930.70] Story
[2930.70 → 2931.76] God instructs
[2931.76 → 2932.24] Abraham
[2932.24 → 2934.08] To sacrifice
[2934.08 → 2934.96] His son
[2934.96 → 2935.40] Isaac
[2935.40 → 2936.30] Do you remember
[2936.30 → 2936.82] That story
[2936.82 → 2939.02] Now this
[2939.02 → 2939.74] Was the
[2939.74 → 2940.94] Very child
[2940.94 → 2941.58] That God
[2941.58 → 2942.32] Had promised
[2942.32 → 2943.58] Okay we
[2943.58 → 2943.78] Got to
[2943.78 → 2944.34] Realize that
[2944.34 → 2945.12] This is the
[2945.12 → 2945.64] Very child
[2945.64 → 2945.92] That God
[2945.92 → 2946.38] Promised
[2946.38 → 2946.94] And that
[2946.94 → 2947.94] After three
[2947.94 → 2949.00] Decades
[2949.00 → 2950.26] Of waiting
[2950.26 → 2950.82] And
[2950.82 → 2952.78] Putting his
[2952.78 → 2953.20] Faith in
[2953.20 → 2953.56] God
[2953.56 → 2954.18] God
[2954.18 → 2954.76] Finally
[2954.76 → 2955.42] Fulfilled that
[2955.42 → 2955.92] Promise to
[2955.92 → 2956.40] Give him
[2956.40 → 2957.58] And Sarah
[2957.58 → 2958.24] His wife
[2958.24 → 2959.30] A son
[2959.30 → 2960.66] Isaac
[2960.66 → 2962.22] And then God
[2962.22 → 2963.46] Says to Abraham
[2963.46 → 2964.44] After giving him
[2964.44 → 2965.10] This promise
[2965.10 → 2966.42] That son
[2966.42 → 2967.30] Who I promised
[2967.30 → 2968.04] And that you've
[2968.04 → 2968.60] Been waiting
[2968.60 → 2969.34] And waiting
[2969.34 → 2969.68] For
[2969.68 → 2970.48] For decades
[2970.48 → 2971.16] I want you
[2971.16 → 2971.64] To sacrifice
[2971.64 → 2971.98] Him
[2971.98 → 2975.92] What does
[2975.92 → 2976.48] Abraham do
[2976.48 → 2978.44] He dutifully
[2978.44 → 2979.66] Makes the
[2979.66 → 2980.26] Preparations
[2980.26 → 2981.68] He goes

[2982.00 → 2982.34] Mountain
[2982.34 → 2983.56] He brings
[2983.56 → 2984.02] The boy
[2984.02 → 2984.92] He gathers
[2984.92 → 2985.38] Stones
[2985.38 → 2985.74] To build
[2985.74 → 2986.20] An author
[2986.20 → 2987.68] An altar
[2987.68 → 2989.36] He gathers

[2990.08 → 2990.88] To build
[2990.88 → 2991.38] A fire
[2991.38 → 2992.92] He brings
[2992.92 → 2993.32] Rope
[2993.32 → 2993.90] He brings
[2993.90 → 2994.56] A knife
[2994.56 → 2995.88] He is ready
[2995.88 → 2996.82] To kill
[2996.82 → 2997.32] Isaac
[2997.32 → 2997.90] At God's
[2997.90 → 2998.20] Command
[2998.20 → 2999.52] Why
[2999.52 → 3001.46] Why would
[3001.46 → 3001.90] He does
[3001.90 → 3002.34] This
[3002.34 → 3004.38] The book
[3004.38 → 3005.26] Of Hebrews
[3005.26 → 3006.06] Says
[3006.06 → 3007.10] Abraham
[3007.10 → 3007.86] Believed
[3007.86 → 3008.86] That it was
[3008.86 → 3009.22] A test
[3009.22 → 3009.68] Of faith
[3009.68 → 3011.00] So here's
[3011.00 → 3011.14] What
[3011.14 → 3011.96] Hebrews
[3011.96 → 3012.30] Says
[3012.30 → 3012.58] In
[3012.58 → 3013.58] Chapter
[3013.58 → 3013.92] 11
[3013.92 → 3015.62] By
[3015.62 → 3016.34] Faith
[3016.34 → 3017.18] Abraham
[3017.18 → 3017.80] When God
[3017.80 → 3018.66] Tested him
[3018.66 → 3019.60] Offered
[3019.60 → 3020.00] Isaac
[3020.00 → 3020.50] As a
[3020.50 → 3021.14] Sacrifice
[3021.14 → 3022.16] He
[3022.16 → 3022.46] Who
[3022.46 → 3022.76] Had
[3022.76 → 3023.34] Embraced
[3023.34 → 3023.54] The
[3023.54 → 3024.16] Promises
[3024.16 → 3024.92] Was
[3024.92 → 3025.38] About
[3025.38 → 3025.66] To
[3025.66 → 3026.26] Sacrifice
[3026.26 → 3026.52] His
[3026.52 → 3026.82] One
[3026.82 → 3027.00] And
[3027.00 → 3027.28] Only
[3027.28 → 3027.74] Son
[3027.74 → 3029.58] Even
[3029.58 → 3029.98] Though
[3029.98 → 3030.36] God
[3030.36 → 3030.58] Had
[3030.58 → 3030.80] Said
[3030.80 → 3030.94] To
[3030.94 → 3031.16] Him
[3031.16 → 3031.32] It
[3031.32 → 3031.48] Is
[3031.48 → 3031.78] Through
[3031.78 → 3032.32] Isaac
[3032.32 → 3032.94] That
[3032.94 → 3033.18] Your
[3033.18 → 3033.62] Offspring
[3033.62 → 3033.82] Will
[3033.82 → 3033.94] Be
[3033.94 → 3034.40] Reckoned
[3034.40 → 3035.88] Abraham
[3035.88 → 3036.86] Reasoned
[3036.86 → 3037.50] That
[3037.50 → 3037.86] God
[3037.86 → 3038.08] Could
[3038.08 → 3038.42] Even
[3038.42 → 3038.82] Raise
[3038.82 → 3039.02] The
[3039.02 → 3039.42] Dead
[3039.42 → 3040.96] And
[3040.96 → 3041.16] So
[3041.16 → 3041.28] In
[3041.28 → 3041.38] A
[3041.38 → 3041.56] Manner
[3041.56 → 3041.96] Speaking
[3041.96 → 3042.26] He
[3042.26 → 3042.60] Did
[3042.60 → 3043.08] Receive
[3043.08 → 3043.52] Isaac
[3043.52 → 3044.32] Back
[3044.32 → 3044.68] From
[3044.68 → 3044.86] The
[3044.86 → 3045.10] Dead
[3045.10 → 3048.56] Notice
[3048.56 → 3048.78] What
[3048.78 → 3048.92] It
[3048.92 → 3049.28] Says
[3049.28 → 3050.38] Abraham
[3050.38 → 3051.08] Believed
[3051.08 → 3051.24] In
[3051.24 → 3051.42] A
[3051.42 → 3051.84] God
[3051.84 → 3052.32] Who
[3052.32 → 3052.52] Could
[3052.52 → 3052.78] Raise
[3052.78 → 3052.96] The
[3052.96 → 3053.20] Dead
[3053.20 → 3054.92] He
[3054.92 → 3055.48] Knew
[3055.48 → 3056.54] God
[3056.54 → 3056.84] Was
[3056.84 → 3057.06] A
[3057.06 → 3057.50] God
[3057.50 → 3058.06] Who
[3058.06 → 3058.34] Could
[3058.34 → 3058.58] Make
[3058.58 → 3058.86] Dead
[3058.86 → 3059.12] Things
[3059.12 → 3059.44] Live
[3059.44 → 3060.88] And
[3060.88 → 3061.02] When
[3061.02 → 3061.32] God
[3061.32 → 3061.54] Makes
[3061.54 → 3061.68] A
[3061.68 → 3062.08] Promise
[3062.08 → 3062.34] It's
[3062.34 → 3062.58] Not
[3062.58 → 3062.88] Just
[3062.88 → 3063.08] That
[3063.08 → 3063.38] He
[3063.38 → 3063.88] Is
[3063.88 → 3064.96] 100%
[3064.96 → 3065.46] Reliable
[3065.46 → 3065.74] And
[3065.74 → 3066.12] Good
[3066.12 → 3066.66] And
[3066.66 → 3067.28] Truthful
[3067.28 → 3068.06] It
[3068.06 → 3068.20] Is
[3068.20 → 3068.48] Also
[3068.48 → 3068.72] That
[3068.72 → 3068.94] He
[3068.94 → 3069.24] Has
[3069.24 → 3069.42] The
[3069.42 → 3069.92] Power
[3069.92 → 3070.52] To
[3070.52 → 3071.20] Fulfill
[3071.20 → 3071.76] His
[3071.76 → 3072.10] Word
[3072.10 → 3073.12] And
[3073.12 → 3073.22] That
[3073.22 → 3073.38] Means
[3073.38 → 3073.62] There's
[3073.62 → 3073.96] Nothing
[3073.96 → 3074.52] Beyond
[3074.52 → 3074.98] God's
[3074.98 → 3075.48] Ability
[3075.48 → 3075.78] Or
[3075.78 → 3076.00] His

[3081.80 → 3082.12] Have
[3082.12 → 3082.56] Christian
[3082.56 → 3083.06] Faith
[3083.06 → 3083.64] It
[3083.64 → 3083.82] Does
[3083.82 → 3084.14] Not

[3133.66 → 3134.06] Was
[3134.06 → 3134.40] As

[3139.76 → 3140.42] Dead
[3140.42 → 3141.86] Yet
[3141.86 → 3142.10] He
[3142.10 → 3142.28] Did
[3142.28 → 3142.48] Not
[3142.48 → 3143.02] Waver
[3143.02 → 3143.52] Through
[3143.52 → 3144.12] Unbelief
[3144.12 → 3144.48] Regarding
[3144.48 → 3144.70] The
[3144.70 → 3145.16] Promise
[3145.16 → 3145.50] Of
[3145.50 → 3145.88] God
[3145.88 → 3146.24] But
[3146.24 → 3146.42] Was
[3146.42 → 3146.86] Strengthened
[3146.86 → 3147.00] In
[3147.00 → 3147.20] His
[3147.20 → 3147.48] Faith
[3147.48 → 3147.90] And
[3147.90 → 3148.10] Gave
[3148.10 → 3148.50] Glory
[3148.50 → 3149.00] To

[3149.44 → 3150.42] Being
[3150.42 → 3150.86] Fully
[3150.86 → 3151.60] Persuaded
[3151.60 → 3151.84] That
[3151.84 → 3152.12] God
[3152.12 → 3152.48] Had
[3152.48 → 3152.96] Power

[3153.50 → 3153.90] Do
[3153.90 → 3154.30] What
[3154.30 → 3154.56] He
[3154.56 → 3154.88] Had
[3154.88 → 3155.36] Promised
[3155.36 → 3157.68] So
[3157.68 → 3157.86] Do
[3157.86 → 3157.96] We
[3157.96 → 3158.12] See
[3158.12 → 3158.30] What
[3158.30 → 3158.62] Paul
[3158.62 → 3158.84] Is
[3158.84 → 3159.16] Saying
[3159.16 → 3160.10] He's
[3160.10 → 3160.28] Saying
[3160.28 → 3160.78] Abraham
[3160.78 → 3161.58] Took
[3161.58 → 3161.80] A
[3161.80 → 3162.22] Long
[3162.22 → 3162.68] Hard
[3162.68 → 3163.16] Look
[3163.16 → 3163.36] At
[3163.36 → 3163.50] The
[3163.50 → 3164.04] Reality
[3164.04 → 3164.30] Of
[3164.30 → 3164.44] His
[3164.44 → 3164.92] Situation
[3164.92 → 3166.06] Right
[3166.06 → 3166.24] The
[3166.24 → 3166.70] Reality
[3166.70 → 3166.96] Of
[3166.96 → 3167.12] His
[3167.12 → 3167.88] Circumstances
[3167.88 → 3168.28] It
[3168.28 → 3168.46] Says
[3168.46 → 3168.62] He
[3168.62 → 3169.06] Faced
[3169.06 → 3169.24] The
[3169.24 → 3169.60] Fact
[3169.60 → 3170.00] That
[3170.00 → 3170.16] His
[3170.16 → 3170.48] Body
[3170.48 → 3170.66] Was
[3170.66 → 3170.80] As
[3170.80 → 3170.96] Good
[3170.96 → 3171.10] As
[3171.10 → 3171.34] Dead
[3171.34 → 3172.76] That
[3172.76 → 3173.62] Sarah's
[3173.62 → 3173.90] Womb
[3173.90 → 3174.14] Was
[3174.14 → 3174.38] Also
[3174.38 → 3174.70] Dead
[3174.70 → 3176.26] Abraham
[3176.26 → 3176.78] Knew
[3176.78 → 3177.02] The
[3177.02 → 3177.90] Biological
[3177.90 → 3178.64] Realities
[3178.64 → 3178.84] Of
[3178.84 → 3179.08] Having
[3179.08 → 3179.22] A
[3179.22 → 3179.54] Child
[3179.54 → 3180.04] Right
[3180.04 → 3180.28] He
[3180.28 → 3180.86] He
[3180.86 → 3181.06] Wasn't
[3181.06 → 3181.26] Some
[3181.26 → 3181.42] Like
[3181.42 → 3181.96] Ignorant
[3181.96 → 3182.24] Ancient
[3182.24 → 3182.64] Person
[3182.64 → 3182.90] Who
[3182.90 → 3183.14] Didn't
[3183.14 → 3183.56] Understand
[3183.56 → 3183.78] How
[3183.78 → 3184.10] Children
[3184.10 → 3184.52] Work
[3184.52 → 3185.40] He
[3185.40 → 3186.12] Understood
[3186.12 → 3186.76] To
[3186.76 → 3187.02] Have
[3187.02 → 3187.16] A
[3187.16 → 3187.48] Child
[3187.48 → 3187.68] At
[3187.68 → 3187.90] His
[3187.90 → 3188.28] Age
[3188.28 → 3189.28] Required
[3189.28 → 3189.82] Hope
[3189.82 → 3190.26] When
[3190.26 → 3190.52] There
[3190.52 → 3191.12] Was
[3191.12 → 3191.46] No
[3191.46 → 3191.94] Hope
[3191.94 → 3220.24] He
[3220.24 → 3230.22] fully persuaded that God had the power to do as he promised. Basically, if God could hang the stars
[3230.22 → 3239.06] in the sky and count them, then providing one descendant to one man is relatively small beans.
[3240.56 → 3244.34] You know, and some people, when they read the Bible, right, they have an issue with all the
[3244.34 → 3252.40] miracles. They read the stories of Jesus walking on the water, feeding 5,000 with five loaves and two
[3252.40 → 3258.90] fish, right, turning water into wine, and they say, well, that's impossible. That could never happen.
[3259.30 → 3265.44] How could you expect me to believe this? Now, this kind of miracles never really bothered me.
[3266.88 → 3273.38] Why? Well, simply because if you believe that there is a loving God who's intimately involved
[3273.38 → 3279.22] in his creation, then of course miracles can happen. The bigger problem is believing in God
[3279.22 → 3286.36] in the first place. Once you cross that hurdle, then miracles are kind of a minor problem, right?
[3286.38 → 3292.02] It makes perfect sense that if there is a God who made everything, then that he would act in the world
[3292.02 → 3301.12] that he created and do whatever he wants. You know, in the book of Acts, this new fledgling Christian
[3301.12 → 3306.56] church, they're facing so many problems. There's so much opposition against them.
[3307.60 → 3314.96] But because of the action of God, the intervention of God, this church keeps succeeding despite all
[3314.96 → 3324.72] expectations, right? Prisons can't hold Peter and Paul. Earthquakes happen. Assassination attempts get
[3324.72 → 3333.68] foiled. Snake venom doesn't kill. Ocean storms do not drown. Why? It's not because of the strength
[3333.68 → 3340.82] of these young Christians' faith, but because of the God who they had faith in. The God that holds
[3340.82 → 3350.32] them and who does what he will do. Because we can't raise the dead. We cannot call into existence
[3350.32 → 3357.50] that which does not exist. We cannot make multiple generational promises and fulfill them.
[3358.66 → 3368.82] So faith looks to God and the power of God and who he is. And every time a sinner bows their knees
[3368.82 → 3375.28] before him and believes the promise of the gospel that Jesus died for sinners, God creates something
[3375.28 → 3383.52] out of nothing. God raises the dead. He gives eternal life to those who are dead in sin, right? And that is
[3383.52 → 3394.90] the power of God. So Christian faith, what is it? It holds onto the promises of God, and it looks to the
[3394.90 → 3403.08] power of God because it is the power of God and who he is that stands behind his promises. Now I want to
[3403.08 → 3409.66] look at a couple of points of application as we conclude that come from this passage. And the first one is
[3409.66 → 3417.66] this. It's really important, I think, that true faith listens to God's word. Okay? True faith listens to
[3417.66 → 3424.22] God's word. This is, why is this important? It's because of this. That there is a problem or there's a
[3424.22 → 3432.74] question, you could say, that arises when we talk about faith. It's a question that Christians even
[3432.74 → 3441.20] will have when it comes to faith in God. Here's how the reasoning goes. Okay? I am facing circumstances
[3441.20 → 3449.00] in my life that are difficult. I'm facing a problem. So I turn to God in faith. I believe God can do
[3449.00 → 3457.66] anything. He can make dead things live. I believe that. So then the question inevitably is, then why doesn't
[3457.66 → 3467.04] he? Right? A Christian rightly believes God can save my unbelieving family members. Well, why doesn't he?
[3468.66 → 3474.94] A Christian rightly believes God can open wounds. God can let couples conceive. Why doesn't he?
[3476.62 → 3483.40] A Christian rightly believes and has faith that God could send me a wife or a husband or a friend
[3483.40 → 3492.88] or a job or a job or health. Why doesn't he? Right? These are the kinds of struggles and challenges that
[3492.88 → 3500.82] we can have when it comes to faith. God is loving. God is powerful. He can do these things that we ask for
[3500.82 → 3509.70] him. He claims to love us. Why doesn't he do what I want? And that's why we must remember that faith is not
[3509.70 → 3516.12] the same as wishful thinking. Faith has to be based on the word of God. It has to be based on a promise,
[3516.34 → 3523.42] not an uncertainty. So let's take, for example, a couple who are 80 years old, and they say,
[3523.52 → 3531.16] we still hope to have children. Well, they have no promise from God that they are going to have children.
[3532.16 → 3539.68] And so their hope is merely wishful thinking. But Abraham wasn't just hoping to have a child.
[3539.70 → 3546.20] In the sense that, well, it sure would be nice to have an heir. No, God had explicitly promised
[3546.20 → 3553.20] Abraham an heir. And so Abraham was putting his hope in something that God had definitively spoken
[3553.20 → 3559.92] to him. And that is the major difference between Abraham and Sarah and the rest of us. Right? That
[3559.92 → 3566.98] they had an explicit promise from God concerning children. Even if it seemed impossible, we do not.
[3566.98 → 3573.42] Now, of course, you read the Bible, and it says things like, yes, children are a blessing from the Lord.
[3573.82 → 3580.68] It says, be fruitful and multiply. But those blessings are not particular promises to you and me.
[3581.96 → 3587.76] And so it's very easy for us to feel entitled to the things that God has not promised us.
[3587.76 → 3594.88] But what has he promised us? He's promised us all kinds of things. Right? If you are a Christian,
[3595.02 → 3600.48] he has promised that he will be with you to the ends of the age. He has promised to forgive you
[3600.48 → 3605.90] your sins. He has promised that the peace of God will dwell in your hearts. Furthermore, he has promised you an
[3605.90 → 3611.14] inheritance in heaven that can never spoil or fade. He has given us all these promises, and he will do
[3611.14 → 3617.34] those. Those are promises to you. But are you going to get married? Are you going to have children?
[3617.78 → 3623.90] Will you have good friends? Will you have a satisfying career? I don't know. God doesn't
[3623.90 → 3631.84] promise those things. But when it comes to something where God has spoken, you may put your faith and hope
[3631.84 → 3639.52] in that as a guarantee. Because your hope is in God's word. Now that leads to the second, the last thing I want
[3639.52 → 3645.60] to draw out by way of application, which is that one of the promises that we do have is this, that we are
[3645.60 → 3655.34] heirs of the world. We are heirs of the world. Let's just dwell on that for a moment. And we see this back in
[3655.34 → 3660.86] verse 13, the very first verse that Paul started with, where he said, Abraham and his offspring received the
[3660.86 → 3669.48] promise that he would be heir of the whole world. And then as Paul says in verses 16 and
[3669.48 → 3676.60] 17, when we share the same faith as Abraham, when we trust the same God that Abraham trusted in,
[3677.50 → 3685.02] we become children of Abraham. Father Abraham had many sons. Many sons had father Abraham. I am one of
[3685.02 → 3690.18] them and so are you. So let's all praise the Lord. I almost thought we should sing that, but I decided
[3690.18 → 3699.80] against it. Okay. We become heirs, and we receive the same promise, the same inheritance as Abraham did.
[3700.24 → 3705.98] And the promise that God, that Paul is referring to here, is that when God took Abraham out of his
[3705.98 → 3712.16] home country, and he promised him that he would inherit the land, the book of Hebrews tells us God
[3712.16 → 3720.38] wasn't promising him a strip of land in Palestine, but that Abraham was longing for a better country,
[3721.14 → 3728.22] a heavenly one. And so the fulfillment of that promise is that God will bring a new heaven and a
[3728.22 → 3733.20] new earth that will be given to every single person who has faith in Jesus Christ.
[3733.20 → 3742.30] Now, what does that mean for us today? Well, think about this. If you don't belong to Jesus Christ,
[3742.46 → 3747.68] what does that mean? It means that you have to put all of your energy in this life right now.
[3748.80 → 3754.46] And that you might pursue an excellent career. You might pursue great wealth. You might end up with
[3754.46 → 3762.28] a very nice West Coast home. But everything you have is not really yours. You don't really possess it.
[3762.28 → 3768.84] It might possess you for a time. But at death, it will be taken out of your hands.
[3770.38 → 3775.74] But for the ordinary Christian who may not have very much in this life and may have very little to
[3775.74 → 3784.48] their name, one day you will inherit everything. The whole world. And that means for us as Christians
[3784.48 → 3789.46] that you, if you trust in Christ, you don't have to kill yourself trying to have it all now.
[3789.46 → 3796.38] And so imagine this. Imagine you are a poker player. I know it's hard for some of us.
[3797.44 → 3804.84] You're playing a game in a big tournament. You're playing with gold pieces. Okay, there's a lot of
[3804.84 → 3809.76] wealth on the table. But halfway through the first round, you receive the news that you are about to
[3809.76 → 3816.78] inherit all the gold in the world. Wouldn't that completely change the way you play?
[3816.78 → 3825.46] I mean, you would just go crazy. You would have such wonderful freedom to take crazy risks
[3825.46 → 3828.12] because you have nothing to lose.
[3828.12 → 3840.28] If this life is short and eternity is long, eternal, and the promise is that we will gloriously
[3840.28 → 3845.76] inherit all things, right? Jesus, didn't Jesus say the meek will inherit the earth?
[3845.76 → 3854.70] That means we don't need to hold on to the things of this life so tightly, right? We don't have to go
[3854.70 → 3859.82] through life with this bitter suspicion that I'm missing out on something.
[3861.80 → 3866.34] It means that we can do things that people who don't trust in God's promises would never dream of doing.
[3866.34 → 3874.78] We can live for God's glory. We can live so freely, so generously, with so much faith.
[3875.82 → 3880.58] And the primary way in the Bible to give God glory is by believing what God says,
[3881.32 → 3885.96] right? To accept his word, to live in light of that reality. That's how we glorify God.
[3886.76 → 3890.48] And the Bible is telling us that one day we will enter the promised land,
[3890.48 → 3897.76] right? In one sense, we are there already, even now, in our present salvation, but we're not there yet.
[3898.90 → 3904.76] We've left Egypt, so to speak, the land of bondage to sin and death, the realm of Satan,
[3904.76 → 3913.60] and we are now wandering through this wilderness of dust and difficulty, trusting in God daily for
[3913.60 → 3919.60] his manna, for his provision. But one day we will cross the Jordan River, we will enter the promised
[3919.60 → 3925.50] land, the new heavens and the new earth, and we will inherit the world. That is the promise.
[3925.94 → 3933.18] That's a promise to you. God is faithful. He will do it. So let's pray, and then we'll sing about it.
[3936.00 → 3941.06] Heavenly Father, thank you so much that we are your children, that we are sons of Abraham,
[3941.74 → 3946.98] that we're not strangers to the covenant of promise, but that we have been included,
[3946.98 → 3951.90] we've been grafted in, we've become children of Abraham through faith. And we pray, Lord,
[3951.98 → 3958.52] that you would make the gospel so real in our hearts, that you would impress it upon our minds
[3958.52 → 3969.62] and our souls to the very down to our bones, that you are a God that we can trust because of your
[3969.62 → 3974.20] power and your promises. And we pray all of this in Christ's name. Amen.
[3976.62 → 3978.56] Let's sing. Stand and sing.
[3978.56 → 3987.78] Of mentionedском this world on earth.
[3988.28 → 3988.82] Amen.
[3989.06 → 3989.70] Amen.
[3990.00 → 3990.48] Amen.
[3990.48 → 3991.18] Amen.
[3991.50 → 3991.58] Amen.
[3991.72 → 3992.40] Amen.
[3992.40 → 3993.08] Amen.
[3993.26 → 3993.50] Amen.
[3993.50 → 4001.80] A joyous stormy makes our stand
[4001.80 → 4006.98] And cast away for life
[4006.98 → 4012.00] In its fair and happy land
[4012.00 → 4016.64] Where my possessions lie
[4016.64 → 4022.40] And o'er the quiet and dead peace
[4022.40 → 4026.88] Shots one eternal day
[4026.88 → 4032.42] And all the sun for every reason
[4032.42 → 4035.92] We set His life away
[4035.92 → 4042.42] I am bound, I am bound
[4042.42 → 4047.48] I am bound for the promised land
[4047.48 → 4051.96] I am bound, I am bound
[4051.96 → 4057.80] I am bound for the promised land
[4057.80 → 4065.96] No chilling waves, no noiseless breath
[4065.96 → 4070.44] We've reached the healthful shores
[4070.44 → 4075.88] The sickness of hope in the dead
[4075.88 → 4080.46] I'm filled and filled no more
[4080.46 → 4085.66] I am bound, I am bound
[4085.66 → 4090.14] I am bound for the promised land
[4090.14 → 4095.42] I am bound, I am bound
[4095.42 → 4100.68] I am bound for the promised land
[4100.68 → 4108.98] Shall I reach that happy place
[4108.98 → 4113.70] And be forever past
[4113.70 → 4118.78] Shall I see my father's face
[4118.78 → 4123.46] And in His bosom rest
[4123.46 → 4125.94] I am bound, I am bound
[4125.94 → 4128.54] I am bound, I am bound
[4128.54 → 4132.84] I am bound for the promised land
[4132.84 → 4137.90] I am bound, I am bound
[4137.90 → 4143.28] I am bound for the promised land
[4143.28 → 4148.28] I am bound, I am bound
[4148.28 → 4153.28] I am bound for the promised land
[4153.28 → 4158.28] I am bound, I am bound
[4158.28 → 4162.66] I am bound for the promised land
[4162.66 → 4167.94] Amen, you may be seated
[4167.94 → 4170.26] Amen
[4170.26 → 4181.24] Okay, our offering today
[4181.24 → 4183.04] as we continue to worship the Lord
[4183.04 → 4187.00] is for World Renew, their food grain bank
[4187.00 → 4191.06] And I believe we have a video to watch
[4191.06 → 4194.34] that will give an update on what they are doing now
[4194.34 → 4197.12] And so as the deacons come forward
[4197.12 → 4198.60] to collect the offering
[4198.60 → 4200.38] for our church ministries
[4200.38 → 4202.16] as well as for this designated offering
[4202.16 → 4203.92] we will watch the video together
[4203.92 → 4208.62] What would happen if you found
[4208.62 → 4210.30] that your plate was empty
[4210.30 → 4211.96] and you didn't know
[4211.96 → 4213.78] where your next meal was coming from
[4213.78 → 4216.16] There's enough food for everyone
[4216.16 → 4218.46] But our food systems are failing
[4218.46 → 4220.22] an increasing number of people
[4220.22 → 4221.22] around the world
[4221.22 → 4222.22] Why?
[4222.22 → 4225.06] If you live directly off the land
[4225.06 → 4226.28] like many do
[4226.28 → 4228.40] Climate change means more flooding
[4228.40 → 4230.54] or more extreme droughts
[4230.54 → 4232.66] Or you may not have regular employment
[4232.66 → 4235.50] due to your social status or gender
[4235.50 → 4237.78] Or other social or economic reasons
[4237.78 → 4239.12] preventing you from meeting
[4239.12 → 4240.78] your most basic needs
[4240.78 → 4241.78] like food
[4241.78 → 4244.62] Or perhaps conflict has forced you
[4244.62 → 4245.84] from your home and community
[4245.84 → 4248.84] Sarah is a mother of three
[4248.84 → 4250.84] living with her elderly father
[4250.84 → 4253.60] Her family was forced to flee her home community
[4253.60 → 4255.46] because of conflict and violence
[4255.46 → 4258.60] After finding their way to a safer place
[4258.60 → 4261.34] they suddenly had no regular access to food
[4261.34 → 4263.02] Like millions of others
[4263.02 → 4265.10] they lost all their normal supports
[4265.10 → 4267.10] and came to rely on the generosity
[4267.10 → 4268.68] of her host community
[4268.68 → 4271.00] and support from outside organizations
[4271.00 → 4273.16] like Canadian Food Grains Bank
[4273.16 → 4276.16] Sarah lives a world away
[4276.16 → 4279.16] How can support be provided to her family?
[4279.16 → 4282.32] To do this, food is purchased as closely as possible
[4282.32 → 4284.08] to the area of need
[4284.08 → 4285.88] This is most efficient
[4285.88 → 4287.78] reduces transportation costs
[4287.78 → 4289.98] and ensures the most appropriate food
[4289.98 → 4291.40] for those in need
[4291.40 → 4294.92] This is also important for supporting local farmers
[4294.92 → 4296.40] and food producers
[4296.40 → 4297.90] Canadian Food Grains Bank
[4297.90 → 4300.90] works through its 15 Canadian member agencies
[4300.90 → 4303.04] who in turn work with local partners
[4303.04 → 4305.16] in areas where food is needed
[4305.16 → 4307.20] Through these partners who understand
[4307.20 → 4309.54] the local language and culture
[4309.54 → 4311.26] Sarah and her family can register
[4311.26 → 4313.26] for a food assistance project
[4313.26 → 4314.96] She might receive a food basket
[4314.96 → 4316.58] some basic staple foods
[4316.58 → 4318.58] and nutritional supplements
[4318.58 → 4320.84] If she's able
[4320.84 → 4321.94] she could participate
[4321.94 → 4324.44] in food for work project
[4324.44 → 4326.98] and receive food or cash as payment
[4326.98 → 4329.14] which allows her to provide for herself
[4329.14 → 4330.90] and contribute to the economy
[4330.90 → 4333.64] of her host community
[4333.64 → 4335.44] If she were living on farmland
[4335.44 → 4336.94] she may also receive seeds
[4336.94 → 4339.08] or pools or even animals
[4339.08 → 4341.10] which provide food and income
[4341.10 → 4342.54] for the family
[4342.54 → 4344.08] If Sarah is living in a place
[4344.08 → 4345.44] where there are good markets
[4345.44 → 4346.90] with available food
[4346.90 → 4348.36] she could receive cash
[4348.36 → 4350.16] or a mobile phone transfer
[4350.16 → 4351.36] or food vouchers
[4351.36 → 4353.46] to be used with approved food vendors
[4353.46 → 4354.50] in local markets
[4354.50 → 4357.20] This ensures she has access
[4357.20 → 4358.96] to enough nutritious food
[4358.96 → 4361.66] and allows her to make her own choices
[4361.66 → 4363.96] about what food her family eats
[4363.96 → 4366.56] Now, Sarah and her family can worry
[4366.56 → 4367.56] a little bit less
[4367.56 → 4369.50] about where their next meal is coming from
[4369.50 → 4371.50] and make plans to get their lives
[4371.50 → 4373.76] back to normal as quickly as possible
[4373.76 → 4376.40] Food assistance is one important way
[4376.40 → 4378.06] the Food Grains Bank Network
[4378.06 → 4380.26] in cooperation with the Canadian government
[4380.26 → 4382.54] is providing food to the people
[4382.54 → 4383.70] who need it most
[4383.70 → 4386.86] To donate, go to foodgrainsbank.ca
[4386.86 → 4411.86] Well, let's go to the Lord in prayer
[4411.86 → 4414.02] as we pray for the needs of the world
[4414.02 → 4415.92] and of our own community
[4415.92 → 4417.48] and we go to the Lord in prayer
[4417.48 → 4418.80] because that is the best way
[4418.80 → 4420.82] or the best place that we can be
[4420.82 → 4424.58] and after I lead us in prayer
[4424.58 → 4426.40] we will say together the Lord's Prayer
[4426.40 → 4428.00] So, would you please join me?
[4431.62 → 4433.14] Our Great Father in Heaven
[4433.14 → 4437.68] We rejoice that we have the privilege
[4437.68 → 4439.72] to call you Father
[4439.72 → 4442.16] Even as we acknowledge
[4442.16 → 4443.76] that often we take that for granted
[4443.76 → 4447.52] that by the work of your Son, Jesus Christ
[4447.52 → 4449.10] we have become sons
[4449.10 → 4450.44] Sons with Christ
[4450.44 → 4451.58] Co-heirs with Him
[4451.58 → 4455.00] And the privilege of addressing you
[4455.00 → 4456.46] as Father is now ours
[4456.46 → 4458.78] And Lord, we know that you delight
[4458.78 → 4460.08] to hear our prayers
[4460.08 → 4462.24] even as you know them
[4462.24 → 4463.78] before we even ask
[4463.78 → 4467.98] So, Father, you tell us to pray for our world
[4467.98 → 4471.28] and for those you've put in authority over it
[4471.28 → 4473.52] And so we do that this morning
[4473.52 → 4476.66] Father, we acknowledge that seemingly everywhere
[4476.66 → 4477.64] there is conflict
[4477.64 → 4479.66] that there is change
[4479.66 → 4481.58] that stability
[4481.58 → 4485.96] would not characterize much at the moment
[4485.96 → 4489.56] And Lord, in the midst of that
[4489.56 → 4490.88] we pray for the leaders
[4490.88 → 4492.20] that you have set over us
[4492.20 → 4493.46] and over the nations of the world
[4493.46 → 4495.36] That you would give them wisdom
[4495.36 → 4497.58] That they would pursue righteousness
[4497.58 → 4498.48] and justice
[4498.48 → 4500.26] and the flourishing of all people
[4500.26 → 4502.80] Lord, that they would be peacemakers
[4502.80 → 4507.22] And in the midst of conflict and change
[4507.22 → 4509.94] we pray that you would protect your church
[4509.94 → 4512.98] Lord, we pray that you would
[4512.98 → 4514.82] continue to grant us the freedom
[4514.82 → 4515.66] to worship you
[4515.66 → 4517.06] and to proclaim your gospel
[4517.06 → 4520.52] And where that freedom is not
[4520.52 → 4522.84] a reality
[4522.84 → 4524.24] that you would protect
[4524.24 → 4525.60] those ministers of your gospel
[4525.60 → 4527.02] that you would protect your church
[4527.02 → 4529.14] from the authorities
[4529.14 → 4530.28] that would do them harm
[4530.28 → 4534.22] Lord, we pray in the midst of uncertainty
[4534.22 → 4537.00] in the midst of sorrow and of fear
[4537.00 → 4539.76] that you would draw people to yourself
[4539.76 → 4542.62] that you would help us
[4542.62 → 4544.04] not to put our trust in princes
[4544.04 → 4546.86] or in the strength of horses
[4546.86 → 4548.58] or anything, Lord
[4548.58 → 4550.38] but that we would put our trust in you
[4550.38 → 4552.14] and that in doing so
[4552.14 → 4554.68] that we would loosen our grip
[4554.68 → 4557.68] on our love of this world
[4557.68 → 4559.64] and cast our eyes on you
[4559.64 → 4563.42] We pray that those who do not know you
[4563.42 → 4564.48] would come to know you
[4564.48 → 4566.98] and that those who do know you already
[4566.98 → 4567.98] would rest deeply
[4567.98 → 4570.46] and more surely in the hope
[4570.46 → 4572.44] of their salvation in Christ
[4572.44 → 4576.12] Lord, we rejoice that our citizenship
[4576.12 → 4576.88] is in heaven
[4576.88 → 4580.12] and our lives are hidden there with Christ
[4580.12 → 4583.90] Lord, we thank you for the work of ministry
[4583.90 → 4585.52] through your church here on earth
[4585.52 → 4587.68] and this morning we especially thank you
[4587.68 → 4589.08] for the work of World Renew
[4589.08 → 4590.78] and the Canadian Food Grains Bank
[4590.78 → 4594.08] Lord, we pray that through your people
[4594.08 → 4595.06] here in Canada
[4595.06 → 4598.66] through the generosity that we can show
[4598.66 → 4599.60] because of the gospel
[4599.60 → 4602.02] that you would use us to be a blessing
[4602.02 → 4603.08] to many nations
[4603.08 → 4605.42] Lord, would you meet the needs
[4605.42 → 4606.96] of those who are hungry
[4606.96 → 4608.90] and who are needy
[4608.90 → 4610.70] through the generosity of your church
[4610.70 → 4613.20] so that you would receive the glory
[4613.20 → 4616.32] Father, we pray that you would raise up workers
[4616.32 → 4618.04] also for the harvest of the gospel
[4618.04 → 4620.76] here in our midst
[4620.76 → 4622.96] and throughout the world
[4622.96 → 4624.34] would you put your call
[4624.34 → 4625.84] on the hearts of men and women
[4625.84 → 4627.96] who need to leave the comfort
[4627.96 → 4629.62] that they might have
[4629.62 → 4631.56] and to go and share the good news of Jesus
[4631.56 → 4634.80] Lord, would you make us all missionaries
[4634.80 → 4636.80] in the place that you have put us
[4636.80 → 4639.20] convince us of your power
[4639.20 → 4640.12] and of your promises
[4640.12 → 4642.18] that we might overcome
[4642.18 → 4644.50] fear and obstacles
[4644.50 → 4646.40] to share the good news of the gospel
[4646.40 → 4647.10] with our neighbours
[4647.10 → 4649.50] through word and through deed
[4649.50 → 4651.54] and by the mighty power
[4651.54 → 4652.34] of your Holy Spirit
[4652.34 → 4653.82] who rose Christ from the dead
[4653.82 → 4655.10] would you raise
[4655.10 → 4656.56] the spiritually dead
[4656.56 → 4658.28] to new life in Christ
[4658.28 → 4660.36] as you do so still today
[4660.36 → 4662.90] Father, we pray for the many needs
[4662.90 → 4663.66] of our congregation
[4663.66 → 4665.76] Lord, we grieve the death
[4665.76 → 4667.60] of our sister Grace Krista
[4667.60 → 4671.38] and Lord, for those of us
[4671.38 → 4672.24] her church family
[4672.24 → 4672.88] who are grieving
[4672.88 → 4674.48] for those who also
[4674.48 → 4677.20] of Grace's biological family
[4677.20 → 4679.00] Lord, would you give us comfort
[4679.00 → 4680.94] would you fill us
[4680.94 → 4681.64] with the peace
[4681.64 → 4682.78] that surpasses
[4682.78 → 4684.14] all understanding
[4684.14 → 4685.84] and we thank you
[4685.84 → 4686.90] for the hope of salvation
[4686.90 → 4687.86] and indeed
[4687.86 → 4688.84] for the hope of heaven
[4688.84 → 4691.36] Lord, we pray for the sick
[4691.36 → 4691.86] among us
[4691.86 → 4692.58] and there are many
[4692.58 → 4695.04] Lord, bring healing
[4695.04 → 4697.86] Father, we pray particularly
[4697.86 → 4698.88] for Connie Graham
[4698.88 → 4700.94] as she faces
[4700.94 → 4703.58] what humanly
[4703.58 → 4705.44] seems to be the end
[4705.44 → 4706.54] of her earthly pilgrimage
[4706.54 → 4708.28] we thank you
[4708.28 → 4709.92] Lord, for her strong faith
[4709.92 → 4711.90] for the assurance
[4711.90 → 4713.38] and the security
[4713.38 → 4714.68] that she feels
[4714.68 → 4715.60] that she belongs
[4715.60 → 4716.82] with you
[4716.82 → 4717.90] and has a place
[4717.90 → 4718.32] with you
[4718.32 → 4719.02] in eternity
[4719.02 → 4720.86] Lord, we thank you
[4720.86 → 4721.48] for the promise
[4721.48 → 4722.14] that even though
[4722.14 → 4722.72] we walk through
[4722.72 → 4723.58] the valley of the shadow
[4723.58 → 4724.02] of death
[4724.02 → 4724.58] that you
[4724.58 → 4725.48] our good shepherd
[4725.48 → 4726.56] are with us
[4726.56 → 4727.68] Lord, would you give
[4727.68 → 4728.84] Connie a deep sense
[4728.84 → 4729.86] of your presence
[4729.86 → 4730.56] with her now
[4730.56 → 4731.38] and even Lord
[4731.38 → 4733.32] we ask for miracles
[4733.32 → 4733.82] to happen
[4733.82 → 4735.26] we know that you
[4735.26 → 4735.74] can heal
[4735.74 → 4736.86] you don't give us
[4736.86 → 4737.80] that particular promise
[4737.80 → 4738.66] that you will heal Connie
[4738.66 → 4740.72] but we have faith in you
[4740.72 → 4742.12] so Lord
[4742.12 → 4743.12] if it's according
[4743.12 → 4743.74] to your will
[4743.74 → 4744.80] would you bring her
[4744.80 → 4745.56] back to health
[4745.56 → 4747.68] and Lord
[4747.68 → 4748.46] for the others
[4748.46 → 4749.46] in our congregation
[4749.46 → 4750.40] Lord, who are suffering
[4750.40 → 4751.20] in different ways
[4751.20 → 4752.52] we ask for your special
[4752.52 → 4753.22] mercy upon them
[4753.22 → 4753.64] this morning
[4753.64 → 4755.32] Lord, would you bless
[4755.32 → 4755.90] all of us
[4755.90 → 4757.06] and we pray
[4757.06 → 4757.88] in the name of Jesus
[4757.88 → 4759.40] who taught us
[4759.40 → 4759.84] to pray
[4759.84 → 4761.54] saying together
[4761.54 → 4762.50] our Father
[4762.50 → 4763.56] who art in heaven
[4763.56 → 4765.58] hallowed be thy name
[4765.58 → 4767.00] thy kingdom come
[4767.00 → 4768.20] thy will be done
[4768.20 → 4769.14] on earth
[4769.14 → 4770.08] as it is in heaven
[4770.08 → 4771.64] give us this day
[4771.64 → 4772.64] our daily bread
[4772.64 → 4773.62] forgive us
[4773.62 → 4774.38] our trespasses
[4774.38 → 4775.98] as we forgive those
[4775.98 → 4776.94] who trespass
[4776.94 → 4777.78] against us
[4777.78 → 4779.12] and lead us not
[4779.12 → 4779.92] into temptation
[4779.92 → 4781.28] but deliver us
[4781.28 → 4781.84] from evil
[4781.84 → 4783.08] for yours
[4783.08 → 4783.82] is the kingdom
[4783.82 → 4784.86] and the power
[4784.86 → 4785.90] and the glory
[4785.90 → 4787.36] forever and ever
[4787.36 → 4788.22] Amen
[4788.22 → 4790.48] let's all stand
[4790.48 → 4792.86] and so
[4792.86 → 4795.42] so glad
[4795.42 → 4796.84] that we were able
[4796.84 → 4797.42] to worship the Lord
[4797.42 → 4797.90] together
[4797.90 → 4799.18] do join us
[4799.18 → 4799.98] for a time of fellowship
[4799.98 → 4801.34] in the back
[4801.34 → 4802.54] fellowship hall
[4802.54 → 4803.02] coffee
[4803.02 → 4804.18] maybe some other treats
[4804.18 → 4805.42] and
[4805.42 → 4807.20] I'm going to give
[4807.20 → 4807.76] the benediction
[4807.76 → 4808.76] we're going to sing a song
[4808.76 → 4809.52] and I ask you then
[4809.52 → 4810.22] to actually
[4810.22 → 4812.26] remain for a moment
[4812.26 → 4813.34] because I want to
[4813.34 → 4814.16] share something with you
[4814.16 → 4814.56] okay
[4814.56 → 4814.86] so
[4814.86 → 4816.16] let me give you
[4816.16 → 4816.70] the benediction
[4816.70 → 4819.06] may God
[4819.06 → 4819.64] be gracious
[4819.64 → 4820.20] to us
[4820.20 → 4820.94] and bless us
[4820.94 → 4821.70] and make his face
[4821.70 → 4822.78] to shine upon us
[4822.78 → 4824.50] so that your ways
[4824.50 → 4825.18] may be known
[4825.18 → 4825.80] on earth
[4825.80 → 4827.26] your salvation
[4827.26 → 4828.16] among
[4828.16 → 4829.34] all nations
[4829.34 → 4830.04] Amen
[4830.04 → 4834.04] we'll sing together
[4834.04 → 4835.16] a new benediction
[4835.16 → 4835.64] song
[4835.64 → 4836.54] but very singable
[4836.54 → 4837.40] and
[4837.40 → 4838.40] may the peace
[4838.40 → 4838.76] of God
[4838.76 → 4839.24] our Father
[4839.24 → 4839.80] the grace
[4839.80 → 4840.28] of Christ
[4840.28 → 4840.86] and the fellowship
[4840.86 → 4841.44] of the Spirit
[4841.44 → 4842.96] keep our hearts
[4842.96 → 4866.02] may the peace
[4866.02 → 4866.86] of God
[4866.86 → 4869.34] our heavenly Father
[4869.34 → 4871.44] and the grace
[4871.44 → 4872.44] of Christ
[4872.44 → 4874.38] the risen Son
[4874.38 → 4877.60] and the fellowship
[4877.60 → 4878.60] of Christ
[4878.60 → 4880.28] the Spirit
[4880.28 → 4882.48] keep our hearts
[4882.48 → 4884.38] upon the days
[4884.38 → 4885.80] of God
[4885.80 → 4887.94] to Him
[4887.94 → 4889.12] be praise
[4889.12 → 4890.88] for His glorious
[4890.88 → 4891.66] friend
[4891.66 → 4893.40] from the depths
[4893.40 → 4894.32] of earth
[4894.32 → 4895.92] and the heights
[4895.92 → 4896.98] of heaven
[4896.98 → 4898.48] we declare
[4898.48 → 4899.62] the name
[4899.62 → 4901.16] of the Lamb
[4901.16 → 4902.30] one saint
[4902.30 → 4903.64] praise eternal
[4903.64 → 4905.60] the King
[4905.60 → 4906.78] of me
[4906.78 → 4917.20] who made us peace
[4917.20 → 4918.30] His cross
[4918.30 → 4920.62] His understanding
[4920.62 → 4922.64] and His grace
[4922.64 → 4923.92] which makes us
[4923.92 → 4924.66] love me
[4924.66 → 4927.10] Held his promises
[4927.10 → 4927.60] His heaven
[4927.60 → 4927.88] into heaven
[4927.88 → 4929.50] the Holy
[4929.50 → 4930.34] the Lord
[4930.34 → 4930.58] He ornate
[4930.58 → 4948.02] by the What
[4948.02 → 4948.44] He him
[4948.44 → 4949.10] himself
[4949.10 → 4950.14] in my reign
[4950.14 → 4957.40] All I am once saved, Christ eternal, the King of kings.
[4957.40 → 4963.66] Christ eternal, the King of kings.
[4965.04 → 4966.02] You may be seated.
[4973.40 → 4975.42] So the announcement is this.
[4976.22 → 4977.38] This won't take long.
[4977.38 → 4988.08] But I do want to let you know that I have received a call from another congregation.
[4988.96 → 4993.68] The call has come from East Hill Community Church in Vernon.
[4995.44 → 5001.86] So at the beginning of January, I let the council know that this may be coming.
[5002.64 → 5007.24] I think two weeks ago, East Hill Church, your congregation,
[5007.38 → 5012.78] voted and then therefore extended a call.
[5014.32 → 5021.26] And so at this time, the council and me felt it appropriate to let you know that.
[5021.38 → 5023.42] That church obviously knows and now you know.
[5023.42 → 5031.80] And so I want you to know, one, two, I want to ask for your prayer.
[5031.80 → 5038.56] Because now there will be a couple of weeks of seeking the Lord.
[5039.24 → 5044.88] Because a call has been extended, and I know that a call remains here.
[5045.54 → 5046.98] So now there are two calls.
[5047.98 → 5051.30] And so we need to seek the Lord together.
[5051.30 → 5056.44] My family and I have been, you know, in much prayer.
[5057.02 → 5060.18] And so I ask you to join us as a congregation.
[5061.46 → 5062.56] That's all I'm going to say now.
[5063.18 → 5067.36] And I will, I'm just going to hang out up here for a bit.
[5067.40 → 5070.60] If anybody wants to kind of come and ask me questions or talk, it's fine.
[5070.88 → 5072.76] And then of course I will join out there as well.
[5073.36 → 5077.12] Jim is going to, you know, since I asked for prayer, Jim is going to pray.
[5077.12 → 5080.10] So let's, let's commit our hearts to the Lord in prayer.
[5084.44 → 5089.10] Lord, you ask us when we have a decision to make to come to you.
[5089.80 → 5097.16] And Lord, now as Jason and his family and us together have to make a decision on where the call is here or in Vernon.
[5097.78 → 5104.68] Lord, we ask that you reach out to us, all of us together, so that the decision can be made that's honouring you.
[5105.06 → 5106.94] That's honouring the work of your kingdom.
[5107.68 → 5109.70] Whether it's here or whether it's Vernon.
[5110.22 → 5115.60] Lord, we ask that together along with the Chinese ministry that we pray together for Jason and his family.
[5116.06 → 5118.54] And watch over them and care for them.
[5119.10 → 5121.98] Lord, whatever decision is made is going to be your decision.
[5122.58 → 5125.58] Lord, watch over us, keep us, bless us in your will.
[5126.02 → 5127.22] In your holy name we pray.
[5127.92 → 5128.18] Amen.
[5128.18 → 5128.32] Amen.
[5129.66 → 5130.30] Thank you.
[5137.12 → 5138.12] Amen.
[5138.12 → 5138.48] Amen.
[5158.28 → 5158.50] Amen.
