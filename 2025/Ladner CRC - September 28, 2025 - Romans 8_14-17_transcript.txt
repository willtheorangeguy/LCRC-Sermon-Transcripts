[0.00 --> 29.98]  Satsang with Mooji
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 274.74]  Good morning, everyone.
[274.74 --> 275.74]  Good morning.
[275.74 --> 278.22]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[278.22 --> 279.88]  My name is Jason Truel.
[279.88 --> 285.24]  I have the privilege of serving as a pastor here and today leading us in our time of worship.
[285.24 --> 290.88]  And especially if you are a guest or visitor with us today, we are so glad that you're
[290.88 --> 296.68]  here and I trust that our congregation will warmly welcome you as well.
[296.68 --> 302.04]  This morning we have Dawson Dung on the piano and so we welcome him and we're looking forward
[302.04 --> 304.80]  to worshiping with him.
[304.80 --> 310.40]  After our service today, there is a meeting for teachers and helpers of our Sunday school
[310.40 --> 312.44]  to do a fall training session.
[312.44 --> 316.56]  So that will be in the council room right after the service.
[316.56 --> 320.82]  Our fall cross training is starting up next week.
[320.82 --> 327.82]  We have a special session about how the Christians of the first century kind of related to the
[327.82 --> 329.38]  culture around them.
[329.38 --> 334.44]  And I think that's also very relevant to our life today.
[334.44 --> 338.24]  And so that begins next Sunday at nine o'clock.
[338.24 --> 343.16]  And you can actually find more information about that on the brochure which you can find
[343.16 --> 344.16]  in your mailbox.
[344.16 --> 347.56]  And I think there might be some on the foyer table as well.
[347.56 --> 355.16]  And I'm going to invite our chair of council, Jill Schulte, to give us an update on our 75th
[355.16 --> 363.16]  year anniversary celebrations that are happening soon.
[363.16 --> 372.78]  Well, Pastor Jason already spoiled my intro.
[372.78 --> 376.00]  I was going to make this a test.
[376.00 --> 379.70]  But I do have a question or two.
[379.70 --> 387.16]  Who here knows what it cost to build this church back in the early 70s?
[387.16 --> 390.16]  No, you're not allowed to answer, John.
[390.16 --> 396.00]  John here was responsible for overseeing that whole project.
[396.00 --> 403.66]  Who here remembers who our pastor was for most of the 1990s?
[403.66 --> 415.88]  Well, we'll get those answers and a whole lot more if we remember to come to our 75th anniversary
[415.88 --> 422.72]  celebrations on the 18th and Sunday, the 19th of October.
[422.72 --> 427.62]  And so the reason I'm here is just to remind you of a couple of things.
[427.62 --> 429.22]  And that's where the test was going to be.
[429.22 --> 433.10]  Do you remember what I had to say a couple of weeks ago?
[433.10 --> 434.10]  There was three things.
[434.10 --> 437.96]  Remember, three points to my dialogue.
[437.96 --> 445.80]  One is please, everyone, think about circle calendars.
[445.80 --> 448.30]  RSVP, very important, please.
[448.30 --> 454.18]  We would really like to know how many or approximately how many are coming because we need that for
[454.18 --> 456.80]  catering purposes.
[456.80 --> 458.80]  RSVP, please.
[458.80 --> 459.80]  Call family.
[459.80 --> 464.64]  Call friends that used to be members of this congregation.
[464.64 --> 465.64]  Please invite them.
[465.64 --> 471.80]  Let them know of our celebrations, especially for this Saturday, October 18th.
[471.80 --> 475.36]  Starting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[475.36 --> 481.64]  And we'll have a time of fellowship in a couple of the areas in the back of the church.
[482.38 --> 487.70]  And then that'll be followed by a celebration service here at about 3.15.
[488.78 --> 492.14]  And the whole proceeding should be about two and a half hours.
[492.32 --> 499.50]  But it'll be a lot of time, good time of fellowship and meeting people from some from a long time
[499.50 --> 508.08]  ago, maybe, and just relishing also God's faithfulness to us for 75 years.
[509.22 --> 518.32]  One of the other reminders is we are still looking for any help with memorabilia, photos, trophies.
[518.32 --> 520.70]  We understand there's a few of them kicking around.
[521.36 --> 528.60]  Any mementos from way back or even not too long back that we can let the congregation see
[528.60 --> 531.02]  and the people that are attending come and see.
[531.16 --> 531.58]  Please.
[532.10 --> 534.34]  There's a big box in the council room.
[534.52 --> 536.06]  Feel free to leave it there.
[536.16 --> 540.82]  Make sure you put some identification on it, your name, and let us know where it's from.
[541.06 --> 546.62]  And we'll get it back to you after our celebrations.
[547.28 --> 553.86]  And yes, as I mentioned, the porcelain pig, for those of you who remember, a porcelain pig
[553.86 --> 554.64]  will be present.
[554.64 --> 561.36]  And the last thing is, please, come and join us.
[561.78 --> 562.56]  Really important.
[563.38 --> 566.96]  We need to celebrate 75 years.
[567.14 --> 567.84]  Just imagine.
[568.48 --> 571.36]  Some of us aren't even quite that old.
[571.50 --> 573.60]  And some of us are just barely that old.
[573.60 --> 580.28]  So, have I missed anything?
[581.84 --> 582.36]  Marion.
[586.62 --> 587.18]  Good.
[587.34 --> 593.22]  So, I'm reminded the box to leave those mementos under the mail slots.
[593.22 --> 596.10]  So, it's easier access for people.
[596.36 --> 596.82]  Please do.
[597.76 --> 598.72]  Folks, please.
[598.86 --> 599.60]  Think about it.
[600.10 --> 600.92]  Get a hold of people.
[601.68 --> 606.18]  Let us know by way of RSVP if you're able to make it.
[606.42 --> 606.84]  Thank you.
[606.84 --> 618.70]  So, we come now to the worship of the Lord.
[618.78 --> 619.90]  That's why we're here this morning.
[620.44 --> 626.46]  And we do that with the conviction and with the assurance and with the confidence that God is here among us.
[626.46 --> 632.14]  And so, our worship each Sunday is actually orchestrated by the Lord.
[632.24 --> 634.82]  And it's his work that is being done as we're here.
[635.72 --> 640.90]  And that means, if God is the one at work, it means we come here expectantly.
[641.74 --> 644.98]  We come expecting that God is here with us.
[644.98 --> 652.60]  That, as we gather, he nourishes us and he helps us to follow him as we come each Sunday.
[653.46 --> 657.60]  And so, let's hear and let's respond to God's call to worship this morning.
[657.98 --> 661.08]  It comes from Psalm 105 and we'll say it responsibly.
[661.60 --> 662.50]  So, I will begin.
[664.82 --> 667.76]  Look to the Lord and his strength.
[668.54 --> 670.14]  Seek his face always.
[671.42 --> 674.12]  Remember the wonders he has done.
[674.12 --> 678.20]  His miracles and the judgments he pronounced.
[679.36 --> 682.62]  You, his servants, the descendants of Abraham.
[683.12 --> 685.50]  His chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
[686.28 --> 688.52]  He is the Lord our God.
[689.04 --> 691.58]  His judgments are in all the earth.
[692.14 --> 695.00]  He remembers his covenant forever.
[695.66 --> 701.38]  And would you please join me as we come before our Lord in a prayer of adoration.
[701.54 --> 702.18]  Let's pray together.
[704.12 --> 707.94]  Father, we gather this morning.
[707.94 --> 714.08]  And you call us from the circumstances of our weeks.
[714.44 --> 717.06]  The things that are going on in our hearts.
[718.18 --> 724.04]  And we ask that you would help us as we gather this morning to clearly see you.
[724.38 --> 725.74]  And to know this morning.
[726.02 --> 728.32]  To know you, Lord, with the eyes of faith.
[729.26 --> 731.62]  Father, to know you is to love you.
[731.62 --> 736.14]  And to love you is to know that you first loved us.
[736.14 --> 740.42]  And so, Lord, we ask that you would purify our hearts and our desires.
[741.00 --> 742.54]  Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts.
[743.06 --> 746.52]  By the work of your Holy Spirit that we may perfectly love you.
[746.98 --> 750.24]  And worthily magnify your holy name this morning.
[750.92 --> 754.36]  Lord, help us to sing with heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[754.88 --> 756.54]  And to receive your love.
[757.04 --> 758.62]  The love that you have for us.
[758.90 --> 760.04]  And to love you in return.
[760.04 --> 761.94]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[762.38 --> 762.74]  Amen.
[764.18 --> 765.24]  So let's stand.
[765.74 --> 768.26]  And the Lord greets us this morning with these words.
[770.20 --> 778.46]  Our sermon passage later is about our adoption as children of God.
[778.58 --> 779.66]  Sons and daughters of God.
[780.26 --> 782.26]  And so this is what God says from Psalm 103.
[782.26 --> 788.68]  As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[789.42 --> 792.36]  And as God has greeted us, let's turn and let's welcome and let's greet one another.
[792.36 --> 822.34]  Thank you.
[822.36 --> 852.34]  Thank you.
[852.36 --> 862.08]  Light, God bless you.
[862.08 --> 886.48]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord Almighty
[886.48 --> 895.48]  Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee
[896.24 --> 905.26]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty
[905.26 --> 913.06]  God in three persons, blessed Trinity
[913.06 --> 923.82]  Holy, holy, holy, holy, all the saints are holy
[923.82 --> 933.06]  Passing down their golden coats around the glass of sea
[933.06 --> 942.82]  Seven and seven are a-fear, falling down before Thee
[942.82 --> 951.82]  Full word and not, death never more shall be
[951.82 --> 962.58]  Holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord of darkness hide Thee
[962.58 --> 970.82]  Though the eye may blight by sin, my glory may not see
[970.82 --> 981.58]  Only thou I hold thee, there is none beside Thee
[981.58 --> 989.64]  Perfect in power, in love and purity
[989.64 --> 1014.40]  Who is it not proud to worship
[1014.40 --> 1022.40]  Whose glory taught the sight to shine
[1022.40 --> 1030.16]  Perhaps creation wanted to have the word to say
[1030.16 --> 1037.16]  But I've destroyed His mind
[1037.16 --> 1046.24]  With a thousand hallelujahs We magnify your name
[1046.24 --> 1052.92]  You alone deserve the glory The honor and the praise
[1052.92 --> 1063.68]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours A thousand hallelujahs
[1063.68 --> 1064.68]  And a thousand hallelujahs
[1064.68 --> 1065.68]  And a thousand hallelujahs
[1065.68 --> 1066.68]  And a thousand hallelujahs
[1066.68 --> 1070.68]  Who else would die for our redemption?
[1070.68 --> 1076.68]  Who else would die for our redemption?
[1076.68 --> 1082.68]  Whose resurrection needs a prize?
[1082.68 --> 1083.68]  Whose dreams of rise?
[1083.68 --> 1095.68]  There is a time enough to sing a heart of God And I have
[1095.68 --> 1103.68]  you here to lead to try With a thousand hallelujahs
[1103.68 --> 1110.68]  And a thousand hallelujahs We magnify your name
[1110.68 --> 1114.68]  We magnify your name You alone deserve the glory The honor and the praise
[1114.68 --> 1121.68]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours A thousand hallelujahs
[1121.68 --> 1127.68]  A thousand hallelujahs And a thousand more
[1127.68 --> 1140.68]  praise to the Lord Praise to the Lord
[1140.68 --> 1156.68]  To the Lamb To the King of Heaven Praise for His role
[1156.68 --> 1166.68]  Lord Jesus, this song is for your name
[1166.68 --> 1169.68]  You alone deserve the glory The honor and the praise
[1169.68 --> 1174.68]  Lord Jesus, this song is for your name
[1174.68 --> 1179.68]  And a thousand hallelujahs And a thousand hallelujahs
[1179.68 --> 1193.68]  praise
[1200.24 --> 1205.68]  you alone deserve the glory the honor and the praise
[1205.68 --> 1227.68]  praise oh jesus this song is forever yours a thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1235.68 --> 1257.84]  okay so our first scripture reading today is from jeremiah chapter 31 and so i invite you to open
[1257.84 --> 1265.52]  your bibles to page 591 your pew bible or you can follow along on the screen it's up to you and
[1265.52 --> 1272.72]  and so what you know i like to do is as we are preaching through romans in the new testament
[1272.72 --> 1279.84]  is to connect to some old testament passages that that relate to the theme of what we're preaching
[1280.56 --> 1287.28]  and so so that's how i choose these passages but turn with me to jeremiah chapter 31
[1288.24 --> 1292.00]  and we'll just read verses 1 through 9 this morning
[1296.48 --> 1304.48]  at that time declares the lord i will be the god of all the families of israel and they will be my
[1304.48 --> 1311.92]  people this is what the lord says the people who survive the sword will find favor in the wilderness
[1311.92 --> 1320.24]  i will come and give rest to israel the lord appeared to us in the past saying i have loved you with an
[1320.24 --> 1328.08]  everlasting love i have drawn you with unfailing kindness i will build you up again and you virgin
[1328.08 --> 1336.16]  israel will be rebuilt again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful again you
[1336.16 --> 1343.04]  will plant vineyards on the hills of samaria the farms will plant them and enjoy their fruit there will
[1343.04 --> 1349.44]  be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of ephraim come let us go up to zion to the lord our god
[1350.32 --> 1358.00]  this is what the lord says sing with joy for jacob shout for the foremost of the nations make your praises
[1358.00 --> 1366.16]  heard and say lord save your people the remnant of israel see i will bring them from the land of the north
[1366.16 --> 1372.72]  and gather them from the ends of the earth among them will be the blind and the lame expectant mothers
[1372.72 --> 1380.00]  and women in labor a great throng will return they will come with weeping they will pray as i bring
[1380.00 --> 1388.24]  them back i will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble because i
[1388.24 --> 1395.52]  am israel's father and ephraim is my firstborn son this is the word of the lord
[1396.16 --> 1408.40]  and so now you know in response to who god is and in acknowledging who we are we come to this time
[1408.40 --> 1415.76]  this morning of a time of confession a confession of sin and so what does that mean what what is sin
[1416.64 --> 1424.08]  and well one way to think about sin what sin is is it's saying to the god who made us
[1424.08 --> 1433.76]  us i will find life apart from you right god made us to enjoy fellowship with him but in our rebellion
[1433.76 --> 1440.32]  we say to god i'm all set you know i'll find life apart from you god and in the problem with that
[1440.32 --> 1447.60]  attitude that we can sometimes have towards god even if we're christians is that god is actually our
[1447.60 --> 1455.92]  father so he is not only the god who created us but he is the god who adopted us as his children and
[1455.92 --> 1462.08]  made us sons and daughters and that was the relationship that god has always had and always
[1462.08 --> 1468.24]  intended to have with his people but time and time again as we read through the bible we see that god's
[1468.24 --> 1477.04]  people often did not try to find their life with god but they try to find a life apart from god and we
[1477.04 --> 1484.72]  hear god's heart you know as we do that it kind of breaks our father's heart and we we read a passage
[1484.72 --> 1491.84]  like this one in jeremiah chapter 3 and we'll kind of use this as a call to confession where where god says
[1491.84 --> 1497.04]  this how gladly would i treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land the most beautiful
[1497.04 --> 1506.08]  inheritance of any nation i thought you would call me father and not turn away from following me
[1507.36 --> 1512.96]  so there we we see god's heart desires that we would call him father but in that we would not turn
[1512.96 --> 1517.92]  away from following him and so in our prayer of confession let's keep that in mind and kind of confess
[1517.92 --> 1526.00]  the ways that we do sometimes turn away from our father and let's acknowledge that before him so
[1526.00 --> 1530.24]  let's let's come before him in a prayer of confession i will lead us in prayer
[1533.28 --> 1539.20]  heavenly father we thank you that we can come before you in the freedom of your love
[1540.80 --> 1547.84]  confident lord that you have made us as your own you have bought us with the precious blood
[1547.92 --> 1558.88]  of christ so lord we confess to you that our hearts are sometimes often lord wayward and rebellious
[1560.16 --> 1565.28]  we turn away from following you and though we are your children we act like we belong to ourselves
[1566.64 --> 1572.80]  and lord and that leads us to ways of living that are self-centered ways that don't trust in you or to
[1572.80 --> 1578.80]  to give you thanks for all that you give us for all the ways that you care for us so lord would you
[1578.80 --> 1586.96]  have mercy on us and forgive us thank you that with you there is forgiveness thank you that with you
[1586.96 --> 1593.12]  there is restoration and that with you there is redemption thank you father that when we are honest
[1593.12 --> 1600.96]  with you we experience the cleansing power of jesus christ we pray this in his name amen
[1600.96 --> 1608.64]  you know and though we sometimes act like rebellious children and and live like we're orphans god is
[1608.64 --> 1616.40]  always faithful he's always faithful to us to draw us back he will always be our father and he calls us
[1616.40 --> 1622.00]  to remember that we are his children so hear what the apostle john says in first john chapter 3
[1622.00 --> 1633.20]  he says see what great love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of god and that is
[1633.20 --> 1642.32]  what we are so praise be to god and let's stand now and let's continue to sing and sing in the freedom
[1642.32 --> 1656.32]  knowing that we are children of god
[1661.12 --> 1668.32]  so
[1672.32 --> 1700.32]  there is
[1700.32 --> 1705.52]  brook
[1705.52 --> 1712.52]  place where as may legs have such kindly judgment gave
[1712.52 --> 1727.70]  for the love of God is broader than the measures of the mind
[1727.70 --> 1736.48]  and the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully kind
[1736.48 --> 1740.26]  make our love, O God, more faithful
[1740.26 --> 1744.94]  let us take you, let your word
[1744.94 --> 1749.24]  and our lives will be thanksgiving
[1749.24 --> 1753.76]  for the goodness of the Lord
[1757.70 --> 1772.16]  and because of God's faithfulness, his goodness, his mercy to us
[1772.16 --> 1773.14]  we can rejoice
[1773.14 --> 1775.50]  this is the song that we sent out this week
[1775.50 --> 1777.36]  hope you had a chance to listen to it
[1777.36 --> 1784.20]  so it's quite easy to pick up
[1787.70 --> 1802.52]  sing it again we rejoice
[1802.52 --> 1807.10]  delight in the love he has shown us
[1807.10 --> 1810.58]  gratefully lift up your voice
[1810.58 --> 1814.58]  his gentleness among us
[1815.10 --> 1818.82]  we'll join our hearts with praise
[1818.82 --> 1822.58]  we gather in his goodness
[1822.58 --> 1826.92]  a family of grace
[1826.92 --> 1830.58]  with his dress he's given
[1830.58 --> 1834.48]  praise the Lord
[1834.48 --> 1837.58]  in these times we live in
[1837.58 --> 1842.10]  we will praise the Lord
[1842.10 --> 1845.72]  throughout every season
[1845.72 --> 1849.94]  I am sure
[1849.94 --> 1853.80]  we have every reason
[1853.80 --> 1858.52]  to praise the Lord
[1858.52 --> 1863.58]  rejoice in the ashes for nothing
[1863.58 --> 1868.10]  paying for all that you need
[1868.10 --> 1871.86]  come with the song of thanksgiving
[1871.86 --> 1875.40]  leave your requests at his feet
[1875.40 --> 1879.76]  his peace will fall upon us
[1879.76 --> 1883.40]  in my heart and minds
[1883.40 --> 1887.34]  he cries to reigns eternal
[1887.34 --> 1891.30]  and shatter all of our lives
[1891.30 --> 1895.82]  praise the Lord
[1895.82 --> 1898.82]  praise the Lord
[1898.82 --> 1902.66]  in these times we live in
[1902.66 --> 1906.28]  we will praise the Lord
[1906.28 --> 1909.82]  for all every season
[1909.82 --> 1913.84]  I am sure
[1913.84 --> 1917.76]  we have every reason
[1917.76 --> 1922.40]  to praise the Lord
[1922.40 --> 1923.24]  to praise the Lord
[1923.24 --> 1924.28]  to praise the Lord
[1924.28 --> 1925.28]  to praise the Lord
[1925.28 --> 1926.12]  to praise the Lord
[1926.12 --> 1926.24]  in the Lord
[1926.24 --> 1928.36]  now and always
[1928.36 --> 1931.54]  tell all the good he has done
[1931.54 --> 1933.28]  worship the Lord
[1933.28 --> 1933.90]  worship the Lord
[1933.90 --> 1935.50]  to remember
[1935.50 --> 1939.32]  all of the joy yet to come
[1939.32 --> 1943.64]  the hope that burns within us
[1943.64 --> 1946.40]  the dark cannot destroy
[1946.40 --> 1952.82]  because we have every life
[1952.82 --> 1954.14]  with praise the Lord
[1954.14 --> 1954.82]  to praise the Lord
[1954.82 --> 1955.94]  praise God
[1955.94 --> 1956.14]  thank you
[1956.14 --> 1956.40]  Jesus
[1956.40 --> 1957.72]  to praise the Lord
[1957.72 --> 1958.16]  to praise God
[1958.16 --> 1959.14]  if we have every time
[1959.14 --> 1960.32]  we have the patience
[1960.32 --> 1961.38]  the love that we have done
[1961.38 --> 1962.26]  praise the Lord
[1962.26 --> 1965.44]  in these times we live in
[1965.44 --> 1969.90]  we will praise the Lord
[1969.90 --> 1971.14]  bless the Lord
[1971.14 --> 1971.36]  in enriching Him
[1971.36 --> 1971.48]  on every season
[1971.48 --> 1972.24]  and the gifts of God
[1972.24 --> 1972.96]  with praise the Lord
[1972.96 --> 1974.14]  knowing that we have
[1974.14 --> 1974.76]  sing upon us
[1974.76 --> 1985.14]  I am sure we have every reason to praise the Lord.
[1985.14 --> 1993.36]  We have every reason to praise the Lord.
[2004.76 --> 2012.30]  Okay, I believe our children are now dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes along
[2012.30 --> 2019.74]  with their teachers.
[2019.74 --> 2027.44]  And as they're heading out, I invite us here to open our Bibles to Romans chapter 8.
[2027.44 --> 2032.18]  And it's a delight to open God's Word with you.
[2035.28 --> 2037.54]  I'm not sure what page that is in your pew Bible.
[2038.48 --> 2040.48]  But I think it's in the bulletin listed.
[2041.92 --> 2042.92]  Romans chapter 8.
[2043.20 --> 2044.00]  Can I ask you a question?
[2044.00 --> 2048.50]  I feel like I can't hear myself well, but I'm very, you know, particular sometimes.
[2049.02 --> 2049.88]  Can you all hear me okay?
[2050.40 --> 2051.00]  It's okay?
[2051.14 --> 2051.48]  All right.
[2052.04 --> 2052.44]  Thanks.
[2053.18 --> 2056.72]  I know Don does an excellent job back there, but sometimes, I don't know,
[2056.72 --> 2057.90]  my ears are weird.
[2058.80 --> 2059.04]  Okay.
[2059.86 --> 2060.38]  Great.
[2060.52 --> 2066.22]  So we are in Romans chapter 8, and we're going to be looking at verses today, 14 to 17.
[2067.18 --> 2074.32]  Now, every pastor wants to convince you that the passage they're preaching on is just the
[2074.32 --> 2077.86]  most important passage in the Bible, right, to get your interest.
[2078.76 --> 2080.86]  Well, I'm not going to tell you that.
[2081.88 --> 2084.74]  But I am surely tempted to tell you that today.
[2084.74 --> 2084.82]  Okay.
[2086.02 --> 2091.94]  And maybe you will be convinced yourself as we read our passage.
[2092.12 --> 2095.18]  So beginning in verse 14.
[2096.76 --> 2100.92]  For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
[2102.64 --> 2107.68]  The Spirit you receive does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again.
[2107.68 --> 2115.58]  Rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
[2116.32 --> 2119.80]  And by Him we cry, Abba, Father.
[2120.90 --> 2126.56]  The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
[2126.56 --> 2132.58]  Now, if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[2133.24 --> 2138.82]  If indeed we share in His sufferings, in order that we might also share in His glory.
[2138.82 --> 2140.98]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2142.18 --> 2143.20]  Thanks be to God.
[2143.48 --> 2150.42]  Would you join me as we ask for God's blessing upon the preaching and the hearing of His word this morning.
[2150.54 --> 2150.94]  Let's pray.
[2150.94 --> 2157.82]  Our Father, we thank you so much for these words which are absolutely true.
[2158.64 --> 2161.24]  And that you give to us because you love us.
[2162.28 --> 2168.94]  And we ask now that your Spirit would testify with our spirits that we are indeed children of God.
[2169.68 --> 2172.10]  Because there is no greater gift than that.
[2172.96 --> 2175.66]  There is no gift that is more important than that.
[2175.66 --> 2183.88]  So, Lord, would you come and would you give us a taste this morning of that reality, of that gift.
[2184.54 --> 2186.02]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[2186.76 --> 2187.06]  Amen.
[2189.46 --> 2194.00]  So, you may have heard of a guy named A.W. Tozer.
[2194.90 --> 2200.52]  And he was a pastor in Chicago in the middle 20th century.
[2200.90 --> 2202.70]  And actually, he wrote a bunch of books.
[2203.38 --> 2205.26]  And they're all really, really good books.
[2205.26 --> 2205.82]  They're short.
[2206.30 --> 2209.70]  And many of them have become classics in the Christian life.
[2210.00 --> 2210.60]  A.W. Tozer.
[2211.54 --> 2215.02]  And one of the books he wrote is called Knowledge of the Holy.
[2216.24 --> 2220.80]  And the very first line in the book says this.
[2222.98 --> 2229.30]  What comes to your mind when you think about God is the most important thing about you.
[2229.30 --> 2238.16]  What comes to your mind when you think about God is the most important thing about you.
[2239.56 --> 2243.98]  Now, I want us to think about that for just a minute.
[2244.12 --> 2245.92]  And I want to actually turn it into a question.
[2247.08 --> 2250.26]  And as we ask the question, think about yourself for a moment.
[2250.26 --> 2252.08]  And here's the question.
[2253.80 --> 2256.86]  What is it that comes to your mind when you think of God?
[2258.22 --> 2260.48]  What comes to your mind when you think about God?
[2260.78 --> 2266.54]  When you think about God, when you think about who he is, when you think about how you relate to him,
[2266.54 --> 2269.98]  what are the images that maybe pop into your mind?
[2269.98 --> 2271.80]  Or what thoughts do you have?
[2273.46 --> 2276.92]  And, you know, sometimes amongst Christians when we ask ourselves that question,
[2277.18 --> 2282.32]  it's kind of very easy for us in our minds to just think of what's the correct answer.
[2282.78 --> 2284.06]  We don't want to get it wrong, right?
[2284.10 --> 2285.06]  What's the answer?
[2285.40 --> 2286.94]  And so we say, oh, God is Trinity.
[2287.26 --> 2288.14]  God is love.
[2288.26 --> 2289.20]  He is the creator.
[2289.66 --> 2290.34]  Stuff like that.
[2290.34 --> 2292.04]  And that is good.
[2292.50 --> 2294.02]  All those things are very important.
[2294.98 --> 2299.10]  But it's also important from time to time to ask ourselves,
[2299.88 --> 2303.34]  not just what is a correct idea about God,
[2303.86 --> 2306.30]  but what is in our hearts.
[2307.10 --> 2312.92]  Like, what do we think about God in our every day on the ground level?
[2314.18 --> 2318.18]  What comes to your mind when you think about God?
[2318.18 --> 2330.00]  And the reason I belabor this for a little bit is that the way you answer that question determines everything about your Christian life.
[2331.14 --> 2335.84]  Okay, the way you answer that question determines absolutely everything about your Christian life.
[2336.56 --> 2342.56]  It determines what level of anxiety and fear you live with on a day-to-day basis.
[2342.56 --> 2349.36]  It determines if you live each day with guilt or how much guilt.
[2350.52 --> 2353.38]  It determines how you deal with sin in your life.
[2354.06 --> 2357.64]  And it determines how you follow Jesus in obedience.
[2358.78 --> 2365.20]  It determines whether you persevere in the Christian life or whether you just give it up.
[2365.20 --> 2371.20]  All right, what comes to your mind when you think about God is the most important thing about you
[2371.20 --> 2375.98]  because it will determine absolutely everything about your Christian life.
[2377.12 --> 2382.84]  And what the Apostle Paul in this passage, what God in this passage, is telling us
[2382.84 --> 2391.42]  is that the greatest gift that we are given as Christians is that Christians relate to God as Father.
[2393.68 --> 2395.44]  That we relate to God as Father.
[2396.94 --> 2404.62]  Now, this passage, it does not say that we relate to God in exactly the same way we relate to our earthly, physical fathers.
[2404.62 --> 2411.24]  You know, and it's good to acknowledge that we've all had different experiences of our fathers,
[2411.44 --> 2412.96]  some of them better than others.
[2413.30 --> 2417.96]  But to a greater or lesser extent, our earthly fathers have failed us in some way.
[2420.32 --> 2421.74]  Even myself, right?
[2421.78 --> 2425.82]  As much as I want to love and care for my children, I will let them down.
[2426.20 --> 2429.22]  And we've all experienced that to a greater or lesser extent.
[2429.86 --> 2431.74]  And we carry that wound with us.
[2431.74 --> 2436.22]  But the answer is not to say, well, I don't want to think about God as Father.
[2436.52 --> 2439.12]  The answer is to see that we have a better Father.
[2439.66 --> 2444.48]  That we have a true Father who is always loving and who cares for us perfectly.
[2445.38 --> 2446.90]  So God is our Heavenly Father.
[2447.02 --> 2453.92]  And that is the most fundamental, the most foundational truth that we can enjoy as Christians.
[2455.42 --> 2459.26]  And so, you know, think about Adam and Eve back in the garden.
[2459.26 --> 2459.86]  Right?
[2461.10 --> 2462.44]  When there was no sin.
[2463.86 --> 2466.32]  And God said, everything is good.
[2467.62 --> 2474.56]  What do you think Adam's foremost thought was in terms of his relationship to God?
[2477.44 --> 2479.34]  It was that he was God's son.
[2480.54 --> 2480.74]  Right?
[2480.74 --> 2484.40]  Even in Luke chapter 3, it calls Adam the son of God.
[2485.80 --> 2490.08]  You know, he experienced reality for however long that lasted in the garden.
[2490.82 --> 2492.16]  When there was no sin.
[2492.24 --> 2494.36]  When he had pure fellowship with God.
[2494.72 --> 2498.46]  That reality being, I am God's son.
[2498.46 --> 2501.64]  And that is very important for us.
[2502.42 --> 2510.74]  Because what happens now in the gospel is that God is now restoring us to what he always wanted to be the case.
[2512.18 --> 2512.58]  Right?
[2512.64 --> 2516.74]  And so Adam and Eve, as we know the story of the Bible, they rejected God as their father.
[2517.52 --> 2522.70]  That pure fellowship that they enjoyed with God as their father was severed.
[2522.76 --> 2523.40]  It was broken.
[2523.40 --> 2525.46]  And they became orphans.
[2526.76 --> 2532.00]  But the good news is that God is going to do whatever it takes to get his children back.
[2532.68 --> 2534.62]  He is going to rescue his children.
[2535.86 --> 2540.90]  And so in the Old Testament, you know, God starts to work out his plan of salvation.
[2541.10 --> 2543.80]  And Israel is called God's son.
[2543.80 --> 2552.84]  And interestingly, you know, in Romans here, as we go into chapter 9, which we'll actually not do for some time.
[2553.20 --> 2561.48]  But in Romans chapter 9, Paul, he begins to talk about all of the blessings of the Israelites that they have.
[2562.14 --> 2565.78]  He talks about the law, the temple, all of these things.
[2565.78 --> 2572.08]  But the very first privilege that Paul lists is adoption as sons.
[2574.36 --> 2580.18]  Out of all the families of the earth, only you have I loved, God says to Israel.
[2580.76 --> 2581.26]  Why?
[2582.30 --> 2583.60]  Because they are his children.
[2585.48 --> 2587.06]  And so that begins in Genesis.
[2587.52 --> 2590.08]  And it continues with God's people in the Old Testament.
[2590.08 --> 2599.52]  And so then what will be in heaven the foundational reality of our experience and our existence when we are with God in heaven?
[2599.86 --> 2602.82]  It's that God is your father through Jesus Christ.
[2603.58 --> 2603.94]  Right?
[2604.00 --> 2605.42]  That you are a child of God.
[2605.52 --> 2610.24]  That is what we will most enjoy, most experience with God in heaven.
[2610.72 --> 2613.96]  So now, if that is the case for Adam and Eve in the garden before sin,
[2613.96 --> 2619.82]  if that is what God is doing in his people Israel, calling them his family, his children,
[2620.08 --> 2622.10]  if that is what we will enjoy forever,
[2622.94 --> 2628.56]  you can be sure that Paul now thinks this is very important for how we are to live the Christian life.
[2630.08 --> 2633.28]  And that's precisely what we see here in this passage.
[2633.60 --> 2639.72]  Okay, so let's take a dive in and take a look at these verses, verses 14 to 17.
[2640.98 --> 2643.20]  And we'll begin, of course, in verse 14.
[2643.52 --> 2645.08]  This is what Paul says.
[2645.08 --> 2653.96]  What does that mean?
[2654.06 --> 2656.94]  Okay, what does it mean to be led by the Spirit of God?
[2657.66 --> 2664.02]  Well, sometimes Christians have gotten themselves in a little bit of trouble with this verse.
[2664.38 --> 2669.32]  Because what Paul is not talking about is guidance in decision making.
[2669.32 --> 2675.38]  Okay, so we're not saying, he is not saying, the Lord led me to do this or to do that.
[2675.60 --> 2677.30]  That's not what he's talking about here.
[2678.14 --> 2685.36]  He's also not talking about like a special kind of guidance that only, you know, super spiritual Christians have.
[2686.22 --> 2692.58]  Right, some sort of like prophecy where I know I am being led by the Spirit and other people maybe are not.
[2692.64 --> 2693.86]  That's not what he's talking about.
[2693.86 --> 2701.84]  In this verse, to be led by the Spirit of God is actually the opposite of being led by the flesh.
[2702.86 --> 2704.56]  And that's what, you know, Paul's been talking about.
[2704.64 --> 2710.82]  That being led by the Spirit of God means God is actually taking over all that animates your life.
[2712.00 --> 2716.50]  God is taking over our hearts and our motivations and our desires.
[2716.50 --> 2722.80]  And being led by the Spirit includes the Holy Spirit comforting us and the Holy Spirit correcting us.
[2723.28 --> 2729.34]  And it's the Holy Spirit leading us day by day and always into the arms of our Heavenly Father.
[2729.92 --> 2732.26]  Because that is where we belong and that is where we live.
[2732.48 --> 2734.38]  It's the Holy Spirit leading us.
[2735.52 --> 2739.04]  And the thing is, this is a reality for every single Christian.
[2740.04 --> 2742.06]  Every Christian has the Holy Spirit.
[2742.36 --> 2744.50]  Every Christian is led by the Spirit.
[2744.50 --> 2748.18]  Every Christian, because every Christian is a child of God.
[2749.80 --> 2752.08]  So you this morning, you can think to yourself,
[2753.06 --> 2756.54]  I am a Christian, I am a child of God, I am led by the Spirit.
[2757.48 --> 2757.62]  Okay.
[2758.76 --> 2762.64]  And then Paul goes on, when he says, look, you are the children of God.
[2763.12 --> 2765.10]  Like, that's the main point of this passage.
[2765.52 --> 2768.06]  He then goes on to tell us a bit more about what that means.
[2768.70 --> 2770.30]  So look with me at verse 15.
[2770.30 --> 2777.92]  He says, the Spirit you receive does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again.
[2778.00 --> 2779.70]  Okay, we'll pause there in verse 15.
[2781.68 --> 2783.58]  So do you see what he's telling us?
[2784.42 --> 2790.96]  He's saying that Christians, according to Paul, right, that we're not motivated by fear.
[2790.96 --> 2794.20]  We're not motivated by condemnation or by guilt.
[2794.64 --> 2798.86]  Sometimes people think that is what Christians are motivated by, don't they?
[2799.76 --> 2802.98]  If you ask people maybe in our society, if you ask your neighbors,
[2803.92 --> 2806.30]  what is the kind of the life of the Christian?
[2806.44 --> 2807.02]  Well, fear.
[2807.72 --> 2809.36]  Fear of guilt and all these things.
[2809.42 --> 2809.64]  Sin.
[2810.12 --> 2812.42]  But no, what does Paul say in chapter 8, verse 1?
[2812.50 --> 2814.32]  He says, there is no condemnation.
[2814.90 --> 2815.10]  Right?
[2815.14 --> 2815.96]  That is the gospel.
[2815.96 --> 2822.06]  And so we receive the Spirit that we don't live in fear anymore.
[2822.44 --> 2823.78]  So how are we to live?
[2824.58 --> 2826.76]  Look back at verse 15 and we keep going.
[2828.54 --> 2833.18]  Again, the Spirit you receive does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again.
[2833.34 --> 2838.66]  Rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
[2839.10 --> 2840.82]  And by him we cry, Abba, Father.
[2840.82 --> 2846.84]  And friends, look, there is no, there is nothing greater in all the world
[2846.84 --> 2852.68]  than when we can stop dreading God as, you know, an angry slave master
[2852.68 --> 2857.50]  and instead start feeling loved by God as our Heavenly Father.
[2858.64 --> 2862.72]  And so let me show you a couple things that are kind of striking about this verse.
[2862.94 --> 2863.94]  And there are two things.
[2864.02 --> 2865.74]  The first is that word adoption.
[2865.74 --> 2866.22]  Adoption.
[2866.22 --> 2866.90]  Adoption.
[2867.40 --> 2870.98]  The Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
[2871.04 --> 2872.76]  That's how we become the children of God.
[2873.52 --> 2880.16]  Now, when Paul uses that word adoption, he's talking in the context of the first century Roman world.
[2880.52 --> 2884.62]  And this is an idea that comes from the Roman world, not so much the Jewish world.
[2885.94 --> 2893.32]  And we probably don't understand how important this was in first century Rome.
[2893.32 --> 2898.68]  Because if you are in first century Rome and you do not belong to a family,
[2899.20 --> 2902.02]  you are not just placed in a nice care home.
[2902.62 --> 2903.68]  You are left to die.
[2904.64 --> 2904.86]  Right?
[2904.92 --> 2907.66]  You are left to fend for yourself.
[2908.62 --> 2914.32]  You know, it kind of reminds me of the rabbits that I see hopping all about my neighborhood.
[2914.74 --> 2915.94]  Do you guys have rabbits in Ladner?
[2916.44 --> 2917.62]  I don't see them around the church.
[2917.62 --> 2921.62]  But, man, in my house, there's just a parade of rabbits.
[2922.14 --> 2923.48]  And they're on my front lawn.
[2923.56 --> 2924.66]  And they're munching the grass.
[2924.74 --> 2926.04]  And they're scampering here and there.
[2926.10 --> 2927.24]  And nobody's caring for them.
[2927.36 --> 2928.84]  Maybe they were pets at one point.
[2929.06 --> 2930.00]  They were abandoned.
[2931.22 --> 2933.86]  And maybe we feel bad about the rabbits.
[2933.86 --> 2939.58]  But think about a human being in a hopeless situation.
[2940.86 --> 2942.82]  Where nobody wants that human being.
[2943.46 --> 2943.58]  Right?
[2943.62 --> 2948.02]  Where that human being is looked upon not as a blessing but as a hindrance.
[2949.96 --> 2951.14]  And so then what is adoption?
[2951.30 --> 2956.86]  Adoption is taking this person out of that terrible situation, that abandoned situation or hopeless situation,
[2957.58 --> 2961.04]  and is placing them in a very favorable situation.
[2961.04 --> 2972.50]  And in the Roman world, when someone was adopted, they became true, fully legal sons of the family.
[2972.68 --> 2978.32]  They were, they became, they had the full rights of a natural born child.
[2979.28 --> 2982.46]  And so that is the context that Paul is writing to.
[2982.58 --> 2985.36]  And when all these people hearing the book of Romans, this letter read,
[2985.60 --> 2988.16]  and he says, you have been adopted to some ship.
[2988.18 --> 2989.42]  They know what that means.
[2989.42 --> 2992.46]  It means you have someone who is in a bad situation.
[2992.94 --> 2996.00]  They've been given the full legal rights of an heir.
[2997.12 --> 2999.18]  And that is what has happened to us.
[3000.42 --> 3003.56]  And so when it comes to the scriptures then, every, the thing is,
[3003.64 --> 3007.70]  every single human being who comes into this world, apart from the grace of God,
[3007.74 --> 3010.06]  is in a very, very bad situation.
[3010.06 --> 3016.10]  And God takes such people and he makes them his own.
[3016.20 --> 3019.06]  He makes them not just friends, he makes them children.
[3020.42 --> 3024.84]  So that's the first really striking word that we see in verse 15.
[3025.02 --> 3031.58]  The second really shocking, surprising word is that word, Abba, Father.
[3031.58 --> 3038.26]  And the word Abba, it comes not from a Roman background, but actually from a Jewish background.
[3038.68 --> 3041.90]  It's the, as you know, you may have heard preachers tell you this before,
[3042.18 --> 3045.28]  it's the Aramaic word for father.
[3046.00 --> 3052.34]  And it's a, and it's a word that just implies the closest intimacy,
[3052.34 --> 3055.66]  the closest relationship that a child can have with a father.
[3056.56 --> 3064.96]  It's a word that is filled with feelings of, of trust and affection and security and care.
[3066.74 --> 3072.54]  And what's so surprising that Paul would use this word to describe our relationship with God
[3072.54 --> 3075.36]  is it's because, it's surprising because back then,
[3076.04 --> 3079.68]  devout Jews didn't call God Father.
[3079.68 --> 3085.08]  Okay, devout Jews in Jesus' day did not call God Father.
[3085.22 --> 3087.92]  They actually never dressed God as Father at all.
[3088.20 --> 3091.18]  Especially, say, in the synagogue services, their worship.
[3092.46 --> 3094.62]  In fact, they didn't speak God's name at all.
[3095.08 --> 3097.20]  Because God's name was too holy to speak.
[3098.16 --> 3101.96]  Right, and so they, they had this distance between them and God.
[3102.92 --> 3106.76]  But when Jesus came, Jesus changed all of that.
[3107.26 --> 3108.96]  Right, Jesus is, who is Jesus?
[3108.96 --> 3111.84]  He is the true and natural Son of God.
[3112.40 --> 3115.54]  So when Jesus comes and he prays to God and he addresses God,
[3115.88 --> 3116.60]  he prays what?
[3117.54 --> 3118.14]  Father.
[3119.06 --> 3120.78]  He calls God his Father.
[3122.38 --> 3127.98]  Jesus was the only person who had a close enough relationship with God
[3127.98 --> 3130.64]  where it would be appropriate for him to say to God,
[3131.14 --> 3131.80]  Abba, Father.
[3131.80 --> 3139.28]  Right, it's too intimate a word for anybody else to refer to God,
[3139.32 --> 3142.34]  the God of the universe, as Abba, Father.
[3143.34 --> 3146.36]  But when Jesus came, he died on the cross,
[3146.46 --> 3149.54]  he opened the way for us to God,
[3150.24 --> 3151.88]  and he taught us how to pray,
[3151.94 --> 3154.26]  and he taught us to pray our Father.
[3154.26 --> 3157.44]  So now what happens to us?
[3157.80 --> 3160.04]  Well, the same relationship that God,
[3161.18 --> 3162.20]  that God,
[3163.08 --> 3164.00]  with God,
[3164.08 --> 3167.12]  okay, the same relationship with God that Jesus had,
[3167.60 --> 3169.14]  that enabled him to cry to God,
[3169.20 --> 3169.76]  Abba, Father,
[3169.76 --> 3171.96]  the Holy Spirit bestows that on us.
[3172.96 --> 3176.86]  Okay, the very same relationship that God had with his Father as a Son,
[3177.18 --> 3178.96]  the Holy Spirit comes into our lives,
[3179.28 --> 3182.66]  and he bestows on us that same relationship.
[3183.98 --> 3186.70]  So now as children of God by adoption,
[3187.30 --> 3190.18]  we likewise cry the same words.
[3190.92 --> 3192.60]  We can say to God, Abba, Father.
[3195.20 --> 3198.40]  Right, and so when you think about the Christian life,
[3198.40 --> 3200.72]  what higher privilege,
[3200.96 --> 3203.74]  what higher privilege could you possibly attain
[3203.74 --> 3207.92]  than to be able to call God Father?
[3208.98 --> 3211.80]  Right, you really can't get higher in the Christian life than that.
[3213.04 --> 3215.62]  To call the God of heaven and earth your Father.
[3216.56 --> 3218.96]  And we are enabled to do that
[3218.96 --> 3222.06]  because of what verse 16 tells us.
[3222.82 --> 3223.66]  Where it says,
[3223.82 --> 3226.70]  the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[3226.70 --> 3228.10]  that we are God's children.
[3229.26 --> 3232.04]  Right, the Spirit testifies that we are children of God,
[3232.12 --> 3233.78]  and so in response, we can say to God,
[3234.46 --> 3236.70]  Father, we know we're his children.
[3237.56 --> 3238.84]  And I love that word,
[3239.08 --> 3240.50]  the Spirit himself.
[3241.52 --> 3242.62]  The Spirit himself.
[3242.80 --> 3244.86]  He doesn't send an angel
[3244.86 --> 3246.40]  to do this for us
[3246.40 --> 3247.60]  and to give us this message.
[3248.02 --> 3250.42]  The God, the Spirit himself,
[3250.76 --> 3252.26]  acting on your heart,
[3252.86 --> 3254.38]  assures you personally,
[3254.38 --> 3256.76]  God himself in your life,
[3256.82 --> 3259.22]  assures you personally that you are his child.
[3259.22 --> 3260.94]  He whispers that himself
[3260.94 --> 3262.90]  to your heart.
[3264.18 --> 3265.58]  Now, why is that important?
[3266.94 --> 3267.82]  Why is it so important
[3267.82 --> 3269.66]  that God himself comes into our hearts
[3269.66 --> 3270.90]  and he tells us
[3270.90 --> 3272.10]  that we are his children?
[3272.10 --> 3275.70]  It is essential because
[3275.70 --> 3277.24]  of this reality
[3277.24 --> 3279.28]  that you can be an adopted child of God,
[3279.78 --> 3281.96]  but you can still act like what?
[3284.06 --> 3284.72]  An orphan.
[3285.54 --> 3287.46]  You can still live like an orphan,
[3287.58 --> 3288.92]  even though you are a child.
[3290.20 --> 3290.62]  Right?
[3290.66 --> 3291.68]  You can be a child of God,
[3291.72 --> 3293.02]  you can have God as your father,
[3293.16 --> 3294.48]  and yet you can still live
[3294.48 --> 3296.14]  with this kind of sense of insecurity
[3296.14 --> 3298.62]  as if you were an orphan.
[3299.82 --> 3301.04]  And so how do you know
[3301.04 --> 3302.26]  if you're living like an orphan
[3302.26 --> 3303.86]  instead of living like a child?
[3304.48 --> 3305.80]  Well, here's this illustration.
[3306.02 --> 3307.54]  It comes from Thomas Goodwin,
[3307.64 --> 3309.72]  who was a Puritan minister.
[3311.00 --> 3312.42]  He once told the story
[3312.42 --> 3313.62]  of a father and a son
[3313.62 --> 3316.20]  walking together down the road.
[3317.28 --> 3317.98]  And, you know,
[3318.08 --> 3319.04]  their father and son,
[3319.14 --> 3319.58]  the boy,
[3319.78 --> 3321.14]  has the status
[3321.14 --> 3322.66]  of being a child.
[3322.74 --> 3324.36]  He's just this four-year-old little guy.
[3324.36 --> 3326.94]  He's walking with his dad
[3326.94 --> 3327.82]  down the road.
[3327.98 --> 3329.10]  They're walking together.
[3329.70 --> 3330.90]  But they're not talking.
[3332.28 --> 3332.82]  And in fact,
[3332.88 --> 3334.06]  the boy is kind of trailing
[3334.06 --> 3335.50]  a little bit behind his dad.
[3336.12 --> 3337.00]  But, you know,
[3337.04 --> 3337.88]  they're father and son.
[3339.22 --> 3341.24]  And that is kind of the experience
[3341.24 --> 3342.40]  that a lot of Christians have.
[3343.60 --> 3346.08]  You know, we respect God.
[3347.36 --> 3350.22]  We believe his word is true.
[3350.40 --> 3352.26]  We know that we ought to obey him.
[3352.26 --> 3355.06]  But it's kind of that,
[3355.38 --> 3356.28]  like that son,
[3356.38 --> 3358.94]  maybe trailing behind his dad,
[3359.04 --> 3360.88]  wondering, you know,
[3360.98 --> 3363.40]  if there is that trust,
[3363.46 --> 3364.60]  if there is that love.
[3365.54 --> 3366.96]  But now, suppose this.
[3367.06 --> 3369.74]  Suppose the dad stops suddenly
[3369.74 --> 3372.00]  and he grabs the boy
[3372.00 --> 3374.16]  and he hugs him tight.
[3375.02 --> 3376.00]  And maybe, you know,
[3376.14 --> 3378.02]  just like using our imaginations,
[3378.12 --> 3379.32]  he throws him up in the air
[3379.32 --> 3380.06]  and catches him.
[3380.56 --> 3382.40]  And they're laughing together
[3382.40 --> 3384.30]  and they wrestle together
[3384.30 --> 3385.78]  in the leaves.
[3385.96 --> 3387.78]  And the father kisses his cheek.
[3390.18 --> 3390.62]  Right?
[3390.74 --> 3393.20]  Has that boy's status changed
[3393.20 --> 3394.70]  by all that affection?
[3396.32 --> 3397.30]  The answer is no.
[3397.38 --> 3398.46]  The status is the same.
[3398.82 --> 3399.74]  He was a son
[3399.74 --> 3400.98]  when he was walking
[3400.98 --> 3401.94]  behind his father.
[3401.94 --> 3403.88]  And he's still a son
[3403.88 --> 3404.64]  when he's being held
[3404.64 --> 3405.76]  in his father's arms.
[3406.36 --> 3407.78]  The status hasn't changed,
[3408.12 --> 3409.32]  but the experience,
[3409.96 --> 3411.92]  the enjoyment of being a son
[3411.92 --> 3413.76]  is now completely different.
[3415.40 --> 3417.12]  And so what the Spirit of God does
[3417.12 --> 3418.78]  is it allows us
[3418.78 --> 3419.66]  to experience
[3419.66 --> 3421.00]  and to taste
[3421.00 --> 3422.92]  the embrace
[3422.92 --> 3423.64]  and the kiss
[3423.64 --> 3424.56]  of God
[3424.56 --> 3425.40]  as our Father.
[3426.66 --> 3428.22]  And it kind of works both ways
[3428.22 --> 3429.22]  as the Holy Spirit works
[3429.22 --> 3429.66]  in our hearts.
[3429.66 --> 3430.40]  On the one hand,
[3430.82 --> 3431.56]  the Spirit comes
[3431.56 --> 3432.44]  and it helps us
[3432.44 --> 3433.80]  to adore God
[3433.80 --> 3436.04]  as our beloved Father
[3436.04 --> 3437.46]  and to cry out to him,
[3437.92 --> 3438.50]  Abba Father.
[3439.10 --> 3440.04]  And at the same time,
[3440.10 --> 3441.66]  the Spirit assures us
[3442.24 --> 3444.18]  that we are children of God.
[3446.92 --> 3447.86]  So let me
[3447.86 --> 3448.70]  kind of go back
[3448.70 --> 3449.76]  to our first question.
[3450.84 --> 3451.84]  What is it
[3451.84 --> 3453.48]  that comes to your mind
[3453.48 --> 3455.16]  when you think about God?
[3455.16 --> 3457.98]  And is it
[3457.98 --> 3459.42]  that God
[3459.42 --> 3460.36]  is your loving
[3460.36 --> 3461.46]  Heavenly Father?
[3464.08 --> 3465.02]  That's our prayer.
[3465.32 --> 3466.44]  That the Spirit
[3466.44 --> 3467.18]  would so
[3467.18 --> 3468.82]  tell that to us
[3468.82 --> 3469.46]  so deeply
[3469.46 --> 3471.24]  that
[3471.24 --> 3472.90]  in all of our lives,
[3473.06 --> 3473.82]  every time
[3473.82 --> 3474.44]  we think about
[3474.44 --> 3475.12]  who we are
[3475.12 --> 3475.68]  as a Christian,
[3476.16 --> 3477.10]  who God is
[3477.10 --> 3477.80]  in our relationship
[3477.80 --> 3478.30]  to him,
[3478.64 --> 3479.92]  that our foremost thought
[3479.92 --> 3480.38]  would be
[3480.38 --> 3481.98]  he is our Father.
[3481.98 --> 3483.86]  Now,
[3483.96 --> 3484.64]  I want to apply
[3484.64 --> 3485.26]  this passage
[3485.26 --> 3487.06]  in two ways.
[3489.46 --> 3490.24]  How does
[3490.24 --> 3491.32]  having a clear
[3491.32 --> 3492.30]  sense of
[3492.30 --> 3493.80]  God's fatherly affection,
[3494.06 --> 3494.60]  how does that,
[3494.80 --> 3495.54]  what are some ways
[3495.54 --> 3496.18]  that affects
[3496.18 --> 3496.78]  how we live
[3496.78 --> 3497.48]  the Christian life?
[3497.88 --> 3498.52]  There's two things
[3498.52 --> 3499.42]  I want to talk about.
[3499.54 --> 3500.48]  The first is this,
[3501.02 --> 3501.80]  that it gives us
[3501.80 --> 3502.36]  power
[3502.36 --> 3503.92]  for obedience.
[3504.92 --> 3505.34]  Okay,
[3505.34 --> 3506.08]  that having a clear
[3506.08 --> 3506.74]  sense of God's
[3506.74 --> 3507.52]  fatherly affection
[3507.52 --> 3508.24]  actually gives us
[3508.24 --> 3508.64]  power
[3508.64 --> 3509.78]  for obedience.
[3509.78 --> 3511.34]  And this comes
[3511.34 --> 3512.94]  from verse 13.
[3513.08 --> 3513.22]  Now,
[3513.30 --> 3513.88]  we didn't read
[3513.88 --> 3514.54]  that today,
[3514.58 --> 3515.50]  we read it last week,
[3515.60 --> 3516.72]  but it's all part
[3516.72 --> 3517.48]  of the section
[3517.48 --> 3518.48]  that Paul is
[3518.48 --> 3519.38]  talking about.
[3519.92 --> 3520.32]  So,
[3520.52 --> 3521.60]  here's verse 13.
[3522.02 --> 3522.34]  Remember,
[3522.48 --> 3523.10]  this is what he said.
[3523.42 --> 3524.14]  If you live
[3524.14 --> 3525.20]  according to the flesh,
[3525.24 --> 3525.94]  you will die,
[3526.62 --> 3527.98]  but if by the Spirit
[3527.98 --> 3529.60]  you put to death
[3529.60 --> 3530.16]  the misdeeds
[3530.16 --> 3530.64]  of the body,
[3530.70 --> 3531.26]  you will live.
[3533.12 --> 3533.70]  And so,
[3533.80 --> 3533.94]  now,
[3534.04 --> 3535.24]  how do you do this?
[3535.30 --> 3536.04]  How do you put
[3536.04 --> 3536.76]  to death
[3536.76 --> 3537.56]  the misdeeds
[3537.56 --> 3538.12]  of the body?
[3539.12 --> 3540.32]  According to verse 13.
[3541.54 --> 3541.94]  Importantly,
[3542.12 --> 3542.88]  how do you do it
[3542.88 --> 3543.46]  by the Spirit?
[3544.78 --> 3545.18]  Well,
[3546.14 --> 3546.70]  we said a bunch
[3546.70 --> 3547.36]  of things last week,
[3547.44 --> 3547.88]  but in light
[3547.88 --> 3549.24]  of this passage today,
[3549.36 --> 3550.96]  verses 14 to 17,
[3551.40 --> 3552.20]  here's another way
[3552.20 --> 3552.96]  to think about it.
[3553.52 --> 3553.94]  It's this,
[3554.00 --> 3555.12]  that as the Spirit
[3555.12 --> 3556.60]  causes you
[3556.60 --> 3557.58]  to receive
[3557.58 --> 3558.94]  God's fatherly affection
[3558.94 --> 3560.26]  in greater
[3560.26 --> 3561.18]  and greater measure,
[3561.82 --> 3562.02]  right,
[3562.08 --> 3563.00]  knowing that you
[3563.00 --> 3564.20]  are loved by God,
[3564.50 --> 3565.46]  that is naturally
[3565.46 --> 3566.24]  going to cause you
[3566.24 --> 3567.32]  to love God more
[3567.32 --> 3568.60]  and to hate your sin.
[3570.08 --> 3570.30]  Right?
[3570.38 --> 3570.48]  So,
[3570.64 --> 3571.36]  tasting God's
[3571.36 --> 3572.08]  fatherly affection
[3572.08 --> 3573.10]  is going to make you
[3573.10 --> 3575.32]  want to sin less.
[3576.08 --> 3576.98]  And it's going to make you
[3576.98 --> 3577.50]  want to become
[3577.50 --> 3578.20]  more and more
[3578.20 --> 3579.68]  like your father.
[3582.28 --> 3582.76]  So,
[3582.96 --> 3584.42]  imagine it like this.
[3584.74 --> 3585.56]  We'll go back
[3585.56 --> 3586.76]  to our four-year-old boy.
[3588.00 --> 3589.06]  A father gives
[3589.06 --> 3589.94]  this boy
[3589.94 --> 3592.20]  a extra large shirt
[3592.20 --> 3594.66]  and size 12 shoes.
[3594.66 --> 3596.80]  They are both
[3596.80 --> 3598.28]  immensely huge on him.
[3599.12 --> 3600.32]  But this boy,
[3600.44 --> 3602.44]  he is so tuned in
[3602.44 --> 3603.32]  to the love
[3603.32 --> 3604.02]  of his dad
[3604.02 --> 3606.00]  and he is so tuned in
[3606.00 --> 3607.56]  to wanting
[3607.56 --> 3608.14]  to become
[3608.14 --> 3609.30]  like his dad
[3609.30 --> 3610.78]  that he gets up
[3610.78 --> 3611.28]  every day
[3611.28 --> 3612.06]  and he pulls
[3612.06 --> 3612.90]  that huge shirt
[3612.90 --> 3614.10]  over his head
[3614.10 --> 3615.16]  and it's just like
[3615.16 --> 3615.98]  hanging off him
[3615.98 --> 3617.28]  and he puts his feet
[3617.28 --> 3617.88]  into those
[3617.88 --> 3619.62]  two big shoes
[3619.62 --> 3621.88]  and he looks
[3621.88 --> 3622.52]  in the mirror
[3622.52 --> 3624.18]  and he thinks,
[3625.48 --> 3626.30]  oh for the day
[3626.30 --> 3627.28]  when I will
[3627.28 --> 3628.60]  fit into these.
[3629.74 --> 3630.48]  Oh for the day
[3630.48 --> 3631.30]  when I will look
[3631.30 --> 3632.02]  just like
[3632.02 --> 3633.10]  my dad.
[3634.48 --> 3635.30]  And every day
[3635.30 --> 3636.32]  he wants to become
[3636.32 --> 3637.12]  like his father
[3637.12 --> 3638.14]  to grow up
[3638.14 --> 3639.24]  in his image.
[3640.24 --> 3640.66]  And friends,
[3640.80 --> 3642.16]  that is part of
[3642.16 --> 3642.64]  how the spirit
[3642.64 --> 3643.74]  leads us in holiness.
[3644.88 --> 3645.96]  We are sons
[3645.96 --> 3646.68]  and daughters
[3646.68 --> 3648.32]  of our heavenly father.
[3648.32 --> 3650.52]  Because of his love
[3650.52 --> 3650.88]  for us,
[3650.96 --> 3652.04]  we want to
[3652.04 --> 3653.24]  imitate him.
[3654.68 --> 3655.18]  And so let me
[3655.18 --> 3656.44]  read for you
[3656.44 --> 3657.30]  this quote
[3657.30 --> 3658.18]  from John Calvin.
[3659.10 --> 3659.82]  So John Calvin
[3659.82 --> 3660.22]  wrote this,
[3660.24 --> 3660.98]  this wonderful quote.
[3661.64 --> 3661.96]  He says,
[3661.96 --> 3662.16]  Indeed,
[3662.48 --> 3663.86]  no one gives himself
[3663.86 --> 3665.98]  freely and willingly
[3665.98 --> 3667.20]  to God's service
[3667.20 --> 3668.00]  unless,
[3668.98 --> 3669.80]  having tasted
[3669.80 --> 3670.54]  his father,
[3671.10 --> 3672.08]  his fatherly love,
[3672.72 --> 3673.64]  he is drawn
[3673.64 --> 3675.08]  to love and worship
[3675.08 --> 3676.32]  him in return.
[3678.32 --> 3679.20]  How,
[3679.30 --> 3680.06]  how can we be
[3680.06 --> 3680.76]  motivated
[3680.76 --> 3682.30]  to live the Christian
[3682.30 --> 3682.58]  life,
[3682.64 --> 3683.56]  to live for God,
[3683.64 --> 3684.58]  to serve him,
[3685.06 --> 3687.36]  to put to death
[3687.36 --> 3688.10]  our sin,
[3688.20 --> 3689.70]  to live in obedience?
[3691.38 --> 3691.74]  He said,
[3691.82 --> 3692.56]  John Calvin says,
[3692.84 --> 3694.48]  we won't do it
[3694.48 --> 3695.28]  unless we taste
[3695.28 --> 3696.20]  his fatherly love.
[3697.24 --> 3698.08]  And then we are
[3698.08 --> 3699.06]  drawn to love him
[3699.06 --> 3699.80]  and worship him
[3699.80 --> 3700.24]  in return.
[3700.24 --> 3702.60]  Okay,
[3702.74 --> 3703.78]  now the second
[3703.78 --> 3705.42]  point of application
[3705.42 --> 3706.38]  as we finish here
[3706.38 --> 3708.06]  is that having
[3708.06 --> 3708.82]  a clear sense
[3708.82 --> 3709.70]  of God's fatherly
[3709.70 --> 3710.10]  affection,
[3710.76 --> 3712.46]  it also
[3712.46 --> 3713.58]  gives you
[3713.58 --> 3714.64]  hope in the midst
[3714.64 --> 3715.12]  of suffering.
[3715.88 --> 3716.08]  Okay,
[3716.10 --> 3716.64]  hope in the midst
[3716.64 --> 3717.06]  of suffering.
[3717.48 --> 3718.80]  So look at verse 17,
[3718.94 --> 3720.08]  our last verse
[3720.08 --> 3720.58]  for today.
[3721.58 --> 3722.32]  He says,
[3722.32 --> 3723.88]  now if we are
[3723.88 --> 3724.34]  children,
[3724.98 --> 3725.52]  and we are,
[3726.36 --> 3727.56]  then we are heirs,
[3727.78 --> 3728.54]  heirs of God
[3728.54 --> 3729.82]  and co-heirs with Christ
[3729.82 --> 3731.02]  if indeed
[3731.02 --> 3731.82]  we share
[3731.82 --> 3733.10]  in his sufferings
[3733.10 --> 3734.48]  in order that
[3734.48 --> 3735.34]  we also might share
[3735.34 --> 3735.98]  in his glory.
[3736.98 --> 3737.30]  Okay,
[3738.22 --> 3739.48]  now why is it
[3739.48 --> 3740.44]  that Paul is starting
[3740.44 --> 3741.12]  to talk about
[3741.12 --> 3741.66]  suffering
[3741.66 --> 3743.04]  in this verse?
[3743.64 --> 3744.58]  Doesn't that seem
[3744.58 --> 3745.54]  a little abrupt
[3745.54 --> 3746.52]  to you?
[3746.66 --> 3746.92]  I mean,
[3746.94 --> 3747.52]  it does to me.
[3747.92 --> 3748.76]  He was just talking
[3748.76 --> 3749.22]  about,
[3749.52 --> 3749.78]  you know,
[3749.84 --> 3750.50]  the spirit
[3750.50 --> 3751.30]  testifying with
[3751.30 --> 3751.88]  our spirit
[3751.88 --> 3752.26]  that we are
[3752.26 --> 3753.06]  children of God.
[3753.14 --> 3754.34]  It's all very warm,
[3755.00 --> 3755.24]  right?
[3755.28 --> 3756.30]  It's a warm moment.
[3757.04 --> 3757.88]  And then all of a sudden
[3757.88 --> 3758.72]  he starts talking
[3758.72 --> 3759.42]  about suffering.
[3760.28 --> 3761.08]  And it kind of
[3761.08 --> 3761.72]  ruins the moment.
[3763.00 --> 3764.16]  So what's going on here?
[3764.96 --> 3765.30]  Well,
[3765.32 --> 3766.08]  we can say this,
[3766.96 --> 3767.90]  that if you're going
[3767.90 --> 3768.82]  to have the spirit
[3768.82 --> 3769.70]  of adoption
[3769.70 --> 3770.36]  in your heart,
[3770.40 --> 3770.54]  right,
[3770.54 --> 3770.98]  if you're going
[3770.98 --> 3771.64]  to be united
[3771.64 --> 3772.68]  to Jesus Christ,
[3773.60 --> 3774.60]  if you're going
[3774.60 --> 3775.92]  to take on the title,
[3776.70 --> 3777.98]  I am a child of God
[3777.98 --> 3779.14]  and Jesus is,
[3779.20 --> 3779.46]  you know,
[3779.54 --> 3780.26]  my brother
[3780.26 --> 3781.54]  and I belong to God
[3781.54 --> 3782.42]  as my heavenly father,
[3782.88 --> 3783.12]  well,
[3783.16 --> 3783.72]  then you are going
[3783.72 --> 3784.40]  to have to go
[3784.40 --> 3784.94]  through some
[3784.94 --> 3785.46]  of the same
[3785.46 --> 3786.26]  experiences
[3786.26 --> 3787.58]  and circumstances
[3787.58 --> 3788.78]  that God put
[3788.78 --> 3789.96]  his natural son
[3789.96 --> 3790.26]  through.
[3792.60 --> 3793.04]  Right?
[3793.10 --> 3793.74]  If Jesus,
[3793.92 --> 3795.04]  as the natural,
[3795.58 --> 3796.64]  true son of God,
[3796.76 --> 3798.36]  suffered in this life,
[3799.24 --> 3799.46]  well,
[3799.52 --> 3800.36]  if we're adopted
[3800.36 --> 3801.22]  children of God,
[3801.34 --> 3803.02]  we might expect
[3803.02 --> 3803.50]  that we're going
[3803.50 --> 3804.34]  to suffer as well.
[3805.46 --> 3805.70]  You know,
[3805.74 --> 3806.18]  in fact,
[3806.18 --> 3806.76]  Jesus said,
[3806.82 --> 3807.64]  to follow him
[3807.64 --> 3808.74]  is to what?
[3809.46 --> 3810.12]  Is to take up
[3810.12 --> 3810.66]  our cross
[3810.66 --> 3812.18]  and to follow him.
[3813.22 --> 3813.54]  You know,
[3813.62 --> 3814.52]  in that verb,
[3814.60 --> 3815.56]  that verb cry,
[3815.72 --> 3817.00]  by which we cry,
[3817.14 --> 3817.42]  Abba,
[3817.48 --> 3817.76]  Father,
[3817.88 --> 3818.68]  that word cry,
[3819.00 --> 3819.74]  it can also mean
[3819.74 --> 3820.92]  to yell or scream.
[3822.66 --> 3823.70]  It can be a cry
[3823.70 --> 3824.42]  of anguish.
[3825.04 --> 3825.26]  Right?
[3825.34 --> 3826.08]  Just like Jesus
[3826.08 --> 3826.88]  in the garden
[3826.88 --> 3827.78]  as he cried,
[3828.22 --> 3828.52]  Abba,
[3828.62 --> 3828.92]  Father,
[3829.04 --> 3829.64]  take this cup
[3829.64 --> 3830.24]  away from me.
[3830.38 --> 3831.04]  It can be that
[3831.04 --> 3831.62]  kind of cry.
[3832.98 --> 3833.54]  And so when you
[3833.54 --> 3833.96]  suffer,
[3834.12 --> 3834.44]  you don't,
[3834.52 --> 3834.70]  you know,
[3834.70 --> 3835.32]  when you don't know
[3835.32 --> 3835.94]  what on earth
[3835.94 --> 3836.72]  is going on,
[3837.38 --> 3838.32]  what's happening here,
[3838.32 --> 3839.52]  and you cry out
[3839.52 --> 3840.80]  to God as your Father,
[3841.14 --> 3842.56]  that is the Holy Spirit
[3842.56 --> 3843.04]  in you.
[3846.28 --> 3847.24]  And now you know
[3847.24 --> 3847.84]  how to suffer
[3847.84 --> 3849.68]  because like Jesus,
[3849.82 --> 3850.96]  you cry to God
[3850.96 --> 3852.14]  as your Father
[3852.14 --> 3852.96]  in the midst
[3852.96 --> 3853.46]  of suffering.
[3854.32 --> 3855.26]  But also,
[3855.86 --> 3856.82]  you have the hope,
[3857.10 --> 3857.62]  you have hope
[3857.62 --> 3858.10]  in suffering.
[3858.92 --> 3859.12]  Right?
[3859.14 --> 3860.46]  Because verse 17 says,
[3860.54 --> 3861.24]  so that you also
[3861.24 --> 3861.86]  may share
[3861.86 --> 3863.06]  in his glory.
[3864.70 --> 3865.40]  And friends,
[3865.48 --> 3865.94]  that means that
[3865.94 --> 3866.58]  there's nothing
[3866.58 --> 3867.48]  in this life,
[3867.82 --> 3868.38]  there's nothing
[3868.38 --> 3869.22]  that God puts us
[3869.22 --> 3869.92]  through in this life
[3869.92 --> 3870.90]  that will lead
[3870.90 --> 3872.04]  to any other
[3872.04 --> 3872.66]  conclusion,
[3873.08 --> 3874.22]  any other outcome
[3874.22 --> 3875.98]  than glory
[3875.98 --> 3877.34]  for us.
[3879.04 --> 3880.12]  And so let me ask you
[3880.12 --> 3880.44]  this,
[3880.74 --> 3881.54]  how do you know
[3881.54 --> 3882.18]  you're going to heaven?
[3883.58 --> 3883.76]  Right?
[3883.78 --> 3885.28]  This is a question
[3885.28 --> 3886.36]  I love to ask
[3886.36 --> 3887.34]  new believers.
[3887.54 --> 3888.02]  It's a question
[3888.02 --> 3888.80]  I love to ask
[3888.80 --> 3891.10]  believers who have been,
[3891.20 --> 3891.46]  you know,
[3891.46 --> 3892.16]  following Christ
[3892.16 --> 3892.56]  for a long,
[3892.68 --> 3893.00]  long time.
[3893.00 --> 3893.86]  How do you know
[3893.86 --> 3894.28]  that you're going
[3894.28 --> 3894.64]  to heaven?
[3896.08 --> 3897.16]  How can you say
[3897.16 --> 3897.80]  with confidence,
[3897.94 --> 3898.72]  when I die,
[3898.84 --> 3899.58]  I will be with God
[3899.58 --> 3899.96]  in heaven?
[3900.74 --> 3901.56]  And the answer
[3901.56 --> 3902.58]  we usually give
[3902.58 --> 3903.28]  is to say this,
[3903.36 --> 3904.16]  well, because Jesus
[3904.16 --> 3905.20]  died for my sins.
[3905.66 --> 3906.74]  Is that the right answer?
[3909.74 --> 3910.18]  Yes.
[3911.50 --> 3911.94]  Absolutely.
[3912.24 --> 3913.02]  There is nothing wrong
[3913.02 --> 3913.52]  with that answer.
[3913.56 --> 3914.22]  It is a good answer.
[3914.90 --> 3916.16]  But how about this?
[3916.82 --> 3917.86]  How about saying this?
[3918.54 --> 3919.68]  I know I'm going
[3919.68 --> 3920.10]  to heaven
[3920.10 --> 3921.06]  because God
[3921.06 --> 3921.66]  is my Father.
[3921.66 --> 3923.96]  and where he goes,
[3924.28 --> 3925.28]  I go
[3925.28 --> 3927.44]  because I'm his child.
[3928.36 --> 3928.82]  Friends,
[3928.84 --> 3929.42]  that's the blessing
[3929.42 --> 3930.00]  of the gospel.
[3931.96 --> 3932.58]  And you know,
[3932.64 --> 3933.58]  people often wonder,
[3934.36 --> 3936.02]  what is Christianity
[3936.02 --> 3936.72]  all about?
[3938.62 --> 3939.10]  Well,
[3939.18 --> 3940.38]  it's very simple religion.
[3941.10 --> 3941.30]  Right?
[3941.32 --> 3941.88]  It's very simple.
[3943.20 --> 3944.38]  God sent his son
[3944.38 --> 3946.70]  to die for sinners
[3946.70 --> 3948.26]  in order
[3948.26 --> 3949.42]  that we might
[3949.42 --> 3950.08]  become children
[3950.08 --> 3951.02]  as well.
[3951.66 --> 3954.44]  And if you want
[3954.44 --> 3955.62]  to enjoy God forever,
[3955.70 --> 3956.44]  not only in heaven,
[3956.54 --> 3957.30]  but even now,
[3957.78 --> 3958.52]  you can begin
[3958.52 --> 3959.54]  by enjoying him
[3959.54 --> 3961.06]  as your Father.
[3961.66 --> 3962.38]  Okay, so let's pray.
[3962.38 --> 3962.48]  Okay.
[3967.28 --> 3968.78]  Oh, what manner
[3968.78 --> 3970.12]  of love
[3970.12 --> 3971.64]  the Father
[3971.64 --> 3972.82]  has given to us
[3972.82 --> 3975.74]  that we
[3975.74 --> 3976.80]  should be called
[3976.80 --> 3978.42]  children of God.
[3978.42 --> 3981.24]  Father,
[3981.24 --> 3982.04]  we thank you
[3982.04 --> 3983.36]  for that great blessing
[3983.36 --> 3984.32]  that you are
[3984.32 --> 3984.96]  our Father
[3984.96 --> 3985.96]  and that we are
[3985.96 --> 3986.44]  your children,
[3986.58 --> 3987.16]  we are your sons
[3987.16 --> 3987.68]  and daughters.
[3988.20 --> 3989.16]  And we ask
[3989.16 --> 3990.40]  that we may be
[3990.40 --> 3992.08]  motivated
[3992.08 --> 3993.12]  and animated
[3993.12 --> 3994.18]  and controlled
[3994.18 --> 3995.28]  by this dominant
[3995.28 --> 3996.46]  thought in our life,
[3997.34 --> 3998.46]  in our prayers
[3998.46 --> 3999.48]  and in our actions
[3999.48 --> 4000.50]  that we are
[4000.50 --> 4001.72]  your children.
[4001.72 --> 4003.56]  And we also
[4003.56 --> 4004.00]  yearn, Lord,
[4004.04 --> 4004.52]  for that day
[4004.52 --> 4005.22]  when we shall
[4005.22 --> 4006.44]  enjoy unbroken
[4006.44 --> 4007.36]  fellowship with you
[4007.36 --> 4008.84]  as between
[4008.84 --> 4009.56]  a Father
[4009.56 --> 4011.12]  and his children
[4011.12 --> 4011.76]  through Jesus
[4011.76 --> 4012.46]  Christ our Lord.
[4013.08 --> 4013.92]  And it's in his name
[4013.92 --> 4014.30]  we pray.
[4014.66 --> 4014.90]  Amen.
[4017.98 --> 4018.54]  All right,
[4018.58 --> 4019.16]  let's stand
[4019.16 --> 4020.20]  and we'll sing
[4020.20 --> 4021.44]  a song of response.
[4021.56 --> 4021.98]  It's called
[4021.98 --> 4023.36]  His Mercy is More.
[4024.18 --> 4024.76]  It's a song
[4024.76 --> 4025.70]  we often sing
[4025.70 --> 4027.42]  as a song
[4027.42 --> 4028.18]  of after our
[4028.18 --> 4029.04]  confession of faith,
[4029.16 --> 4029.60]  but there is
[4029.60 --> 4030.52]  a line in there
[4030.52 --> 4031.56]  about God as our Father.
[4031.74 --> 4032.70]  So I thought
[4032.70 --> 4033.52]  we should sing it today.
[4033.52 --> 4033.58]  Amen.
[4060.52 --> 4065.52]  His Mercy is More.
[4065.52 --> 4066.52]  His Mercy is More.
[4066.52 --> 4067.52]  His Mercy is More.
[4067.52 --> 4069.30]  Thrown into a sea
[4069.30 --> 4070.52]  with a boat
[4070.52 --> 4072.58]  on our shore.
[4073.34 --> 4074.48]  Our sins
[4074.48 --> 4075.68]  they are many,
[4075.68 --> 4078.52]  His mercy is More.
[4081.74 --> 4083.30]  Our patience
[4083.30 --> 4084.12]  would wait
[4084.12 --> 4085.88]  as we constantly
[4085.88 --> 4086.80]  long.
[4087.24 --> 4088.38]  But Father
[4088.38 --> 4089.46]  so tender
[4089.46 --> 4092.08]  is calling us home.
[4092.50 --> 4093.84]  He welcomes
[4093.84 --> 4094.84]  the weakest,
[4094.84 --> 4094.86]  the weakest,
[4095.22 --> 4096.30]  the vilest,
[4096.44 --> 4097.52]  the poor.
[4098.74 --> 4099.92]  Our sins
[4099.92 --> 4101.22]  they are many,
[4101.46 --> 4103.84]  His mercy is More.
[4107.84 --> 4109.08]  What riches
[4109.08 --> 4110.24]  of kindness
[4110.24 --> 4112.60]  He lavished on us.
[4113.02 --> 4114.18]  His blood
[4114.18 --> 4115.30]  was the payment,
[4115.64 --> 4116.44]  His life
[4116.44 --> 4117.80]  was the cost.
[4118.26 --> 4119.30]  We stood
[4119.30 --> 4121.08]  even that we could
[4121.08 --> 4123.30]  never afford.
[4123.30 --> 4125.54]  Our sins
[4125.54 --> 4126.86]  they are many,
[4127.08 --> 4129.30]  His mercy is More.
[4130.30 --> 4132.42]  Praise the Lord,
[4132.42 --> 4137.04]  His mercy is More.
[4137.04 --> 4138.04]  more.
[4138.04 --> 4139.04]  His mercy is More.
[4139.04 --> 4144.04]  His mercy is More.
[4144.04 --> 4146.04]  Our sins
[4146.04 --> 4147.32]  they are many,
[4147.32 --> 4149.44]  His mercy is More.
[4149.44 --> 4151.04]  Praise the Lord,
[4151.04 --> 4156.04]  His mercy is More.
[4156.04 --> 4157.04]  more.
[4157.04 --> 4158.04]  more.
[4158.04 --> 4159.04]  more.
[4159.04 --> 4160.04]  Stronger
[4160.04 --> 4162.04]  than the likeness
[4162.04 --> 4163.04]  new everymore.
[4163.04 --> 4164.04]  more.
[4164.04 --> 4165.04]  Our sins
[4165.04 --> 4166.04]  they are many,
[4166.04 --> 4169.04]  His mercy is More.
[4169.04 --> 4170.04]  Our sins
[4170.04 --> 4171.04]  they are many,
[4171.04 --> 4175.04]  His mercy is More.
[4175.04 --> 4176.04]  More.
[4176.04 --> 4177.04]  More.
[4177.04 --> 4178.04]  More.
[4178.04 --> 4179.04]  More.
[4179.04 --> 4180.04]  More.
[4184.04 --> 4188.38]  In response to God's grace
[4188.38 --> 4189.26]  that He's given us,
[4189.44 --> 4192.02]  we respond with gratitude,
[4192.34 --> 4193.58]  with joy in our hearts,
[4193.58 --> 4196.00]  and in giving some,
[4196.36 --> 4197.86]  back some of what God,
[4198.02 --> 4198.42]  our Father,
[4198.58 --> 4200.02]  has given to us.
[4200.50 --> 4201.92]  And we do that
[4201.92 --> 4202.92]  to see God's work
[4202.92 --> 4204.48]  in our lives,
[4204.48 --> 4205.16]  spread out,
[4205.16 --> 4206.86]  to be a blessing to others.
[4207.72 --> 4208.10]  And so,
[4208.10 --> 4209.38]  we come now to the time
[4209.38 --> 4211.04]  when we collect our offering,
[4211.54 --> 4213.24]  and our designated offering
[4213.24 --> 4214.06]  for today is actually
[4214.06 --> 4216.08]  for our own local church ministries,
[4216.28 --> 4218.00]  for all that we do as a church,
[4218.12 --> 4218.98]  the different ministries
[4218.98 --> 4221.12]  that we're a part of.
[4221.78 --> 4222.18]  So,
[4222.68 --> 4225.26]  may I ask our deacons
[4225.26 --> 4225.92]  to come forward
[4225.92 --> 4227.12]  to collect the morning offering.
[4232.92 --> 4235.62]  as Video
[4237.46 --> 4237.98]  by gens
[4238.16 --> 4238.36]  I want to have some
[4238.36 --> 4239.26]  opinion
[4239.26 --> 4239.68]  in our community,
[4240.64 --> 4255.14]  we come to Man
[4259.14 --> 4259.48]  from the field of peace.
[4259.48 --> 4260.48]  Amen.
[4289.48 --> 4290.48]  Amen.
[4319.48 --> 4342.44]  So I invite you now to pray with me, to join our hearts in prayer for our world, for our congregation.
[4343.00 --> 4346.66]  And we're going to conclude by saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4346.90 --> 4348.44]  Okay, so let's pray together.
[4349.48 --> 4359.32]  Heavenly Father, we join together this morning in worship to acknowledge who you are.
[4360.34 --> 4364.28]  Lord, you are our Father, as we've already spoken of a lot.
[4365.06 --> 4366.18]  You are our Creator.
[4367.34 --> 4372.26]  You are our Redeemer, our Sustainer, the source of our lives.
[4373.28 --> 4375.04]  And we acknowledge who we are.
[4375.04 --> 4377.72]  We are ones who are weak and wounded by sin.
[4377.72 --> 4383.68]  But also, we are ones whom you loved enough to die for.
[4384.24 --> 4389.08]  The ones in whom you delight and the ones you lead and you guide by your Spirit.
[4389.08 --> 4399.94]  Thank you, Lord, that we can bring, because of these realities, all of our needs, our worries, our fears, our pains to you.
[4400.52 --> 4404.92]  That you promise to carry our burdens and to give us rest.
[4404.92 --> 4412.18]  Lord, we live in a world that longs for peace, but is too often at war.
[4412.88 --> 4418.68]  We long for community, but we seem to find new forms of division.
[4418.68 --> 4432.86]  Lord, help us to follow your word that tells us clearly that you are the way and the truth and the life.
[4432.86 --> 4440.02]  Help us, Lord, to obey your commands to love you and to love our neighbors, to love our enemies.
[4441.62 --> 4442.94]  You above all else.
[4443.72 --> 4453.22]  Lord, we pray for those here this morning who have struggles in various ways, especially, Lord, health concerns.
[4453.22 --> 4456.58]  We pray, Lord, that you would provide hope, that you'd provide healing.
[4457.10 --> 4459.38]  We pray this morning, especially for Shirley Rass.
[4459.98 --> 4467.90]  We thank you, Lord, that she is home from the hospital, that Mel reports that she is doing much better.
[4468.30 --> 4469.88]  Lord, thank you for that mercy.
[4470.78 --> 4475.06]  But, Lord, we know that she still does struggle with continuing health concerns.
[4475.18 --> 4478.86]  And so we, Lord, pray that you would protect her, that you would heal her.
[4479.28 --> 4481.14]  And strengthen and be with Mel as well.
[4481.14 --> 4488.04]  We pray also this morning for Sean Limas, as he's just been struggling for so long with Lyme disease.
[4489.24 --> 4495.56]  And, Lord, as he is in Arizona now seeking treatment, we pray, Lord, that you would be with him.
[4496.02 --> 4502.30]  We pray, Lord, for treatments that would be effective in helping rid him of this disease.
[4503.06 --> 4506.24]  Be with his mom, Wilma, as she's there, as Andrew also is there.
[4507.88 --> 4508.56]  Excuse me.
[4509.56 --> 4510.58]  With his family.
[4511.88 --> 4514.20]  Lord, we pray for Pastor Nancy.
[4514.32 --> 4515.02]  We pray for Stephen.
[4515.62 --> 4519.18]  As they are even now in China, they're visiting family.
[4520.60 --> 4525.20]  And as they, in October, will go to Israel.
[4525.50 --> 4527.58]  Lord, we pray that you would be with both of them.
[4528.16 --> 4529.26]  We pray, Lord, for protection.
[4530.42 --> 4534.06]  We know, Lord, that we are never outside of your care.
[4534.06 --> 4537.46]  And we pray, Lord, that you would really bless their hearts.
[4537.80 --> 4539.44]  That they would see you in a new way.
[4539.54 --> 4542.14]  That they would see what you are doing in the world.
[4542.62 --> 4543.94]  And how you're building your kingdom.
[4544.58 --> 4546.76]  And how we are a part of that.
[4546.76 --> 4548.24]  Lord, we pray for our church.
[4548.24 --> 4548.76]  In their time there.
[4549.96 --> 4552.32]  Lord, we also pray for our church.
[4552.72 --> 4558.40]  And Lord, like the church in Acts, would we be so overwhelmed with joy and gratitude because of the gospel.
[4558.40 --> 4564.42]  That we would connect regularly with one another.
[4565.08 --> 4567.96]  That we would gather to worship you regularly.
[4568.34 --> 4570.22]  That we would support each other in prayer.
[4570.36 --> 4571.56]  That we take care of each other.
[4571.56 --> 4575.80]  That we would devote ourselves to the reading of your word.
[4576.90 --> 4579.58]  To the caring of those in need.
[4580.18 --> 4582.94]  Lord, give us glad and generous hearts that overflow in worship.
[4584.00 --> 4587.56]  And Lord, make us a winsome witness to our neighbors.
[4589.34 --> 4593.82]  Lord, we pray that you would continue to call people to yourself around the world and here in Delta.
[4594.58 --> 4597.80]  That you would add to our numbers those who are being saved.
[4597.80 --> 4601.60]  And help us, Lord, to reach out and to join you in that work.
[4602.42 --> 4606.76]  And we pray all these things in the powerful name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our Savior.
[4607.16 --> 4609.16]  Who loved us and who redeemed us.
[4609.72 --> 4611.78]  We pray in the words that he taught us to pray.
[4612.08 --> 4612.76]  Saying together.
[4613.60 --> 4615.18]  Our Father who art in heaven.
[4615.86 --> 4617.14]  Hallowed be thy name.
[4617.82 --> 4618.88]  Thy kingdom come.
[4619.26 --> 4622.22]  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4623.00 --> 4625.04]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[4625.04 --> 4629.20]  And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[4629.80 --> 4631.62]  And lead us not into temptation.
[4632.22 --> 4633.86]  But deliver us from evil.
[4634.40 --> 4638.76]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[4639.56 --> 4639.92]  Amen.
[4641.74 --> 4642.84]  Please stand.
[4644.62 --> 4648.92]  And we come to the end of this hour of worship.
[4648.92 --> 4654.10]  And I invite you afterwards to join us for a time of fellowship right after the service.
[4654.56 --> 4656.90]  Again, a reminder for those of you who are here this Sunday.
[4657.04 --> 4658.20]  Who are teachers and helpers.
[4658.50 --> 4662.70]  We're just going to have, you know, we'll try to keep a brief meeting for our Sunday school teachers.
[4664.04 --> 4666.90]  And we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4667.30 --> 4668.84]  So I invite you to hold out your hands.
