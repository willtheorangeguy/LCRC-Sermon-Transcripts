[623.06 → 625.00] You may be seated.
[625.00 → 626.00] Good morning to you all.
[626.00 → 627.00] And Merry Christmas!
[627.00 → 635.96] So thank you for gathering with us this morning as we come to worship the newborn king.
[636.84 → 644.64] So today, the long waiting of Advent is finally over, and it gives way to the joy of Christmas,
[644.96 → 651.46] because God has kept his promise, the promise that we've been waiting for, that he would send the Saviour.
[652.20 → 654.74] And he came, and he is Emmanuel, God with us.
[654.74 → 661.40] So as we begin our time of worship this morning, we do so by remembering that Christ has come.
[662.06 → 666.42] And we do that by lighting the Christ candle on our Advent wreath.
[666.96 → 671.16] And so I'll invite Clara and Gabby to lead us in the candle lighting.
[672.02 → 677.00] And there will be responsive readings, so please follow along on the screen.
[684.74 → 693.34] On this Christ Christmas Day, we rejoice that the promised Saviour has come.
[694.30 → 698.94] Today we see the fulfillment of what the saints long for.
[698.94 → 706.56] God has provided something better for us, the Messiah, Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[707.36 → 711.64] We fix our eyes on Jesus, the light of the world.
[711.64 → 730.66] We light this Christ candle celebrating the true light that shines in the darkness.
[730.66 → 734.14] Glory to God in my eyes.
[735.34 → 743.14] God, let all the faithfulness be praise you for Jesus Christ, for the fulfillment of every promise.
[743.72 → 750.02] Strengthen our faith as we follow him in the hope of peace, joy, and love.
[750.40 → 750.88] Amen.
[750.88 → 751.00] Amen.
[751.00 → 753.00] Amen.
[753.00 → 754.00] Amen.
[754.00 → 755.00] Amen.
[755.00 → 756.00] Amen.
[756.00 → 757.00] Amen.
[757.00 → 758.00] Amen.
[758.00 → 759.00] Amen.
[759.00 → 760.00] Amen.
[760.00 → 760.06] Amen.
[760.06 → 760.64] Amen.
[760.66 → 762.68] Amen.
[762.68 → 763.96] Amen.
[763.96 → 764.68] Amen.
[764.68 → 767.98] So, just to do something a little bit different on this Christmas day, I would like to read
[767.98 → 768.34] a poem.
[769.14 → 771.32] And this is by Malcolm Gîte.
[772.08 → 774.44] It is called, On the Edge.
[775.92 → 782.66] And it talks about how Christmas re-enters and re-orients our whole world.
[785.08 → 788.62] Christmas sets the centre on the edge.
[788.62 → 798.50] the edge of town, outbuildings of an inn, the fringe of empire, far from privilege and power,
[799.38 → 806.02] on the edge and outer spin of turning worlds, a margin of small stars that edge a galaxy,
[806.54 → 810.74] itself light years from some unguessed-at cosmic origin.
[810.74 → 818.78] Christmas sets the centre at the edge, and from this day our world is realigned.
[819.54 → 827.94] A tiny seed unfolding in the womb becomes the source from which we all unfold and flower into being.
[828.76 → 840.02] We are healed. The end begins. The tomb becomes a womb, for now in him all things are realigned.
[840.74 → 846.06] And I think that's a great introduction to singing now Joy to the World.
[846.18 → 848.64] So let's all stand, and let's sing Joy to the World together.
[848.64 → 854.64] Joy to the World.
[854.64 → 861.64] Joy to the World.
[861.64 → 871.64] Joy to the World.
[871.64 → 874.64] Joy to the World.
[874.64 → 875.64] Joy to the World.
[875.64 → 878.64] The Lord is come.
[878.64 → 880.64] Is the World.
[880.64 → 881.64] As we come.
[881.64 → 894.04] It's a great obsession.
[894.04 → 900.04] And heaven and nations sing
[900.04 → 908.04] And heaven and heaven and nations sing
[908.04 → 916.04] Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns
[916.04 → 922.04] Let all their songs employ
[922.04 → 930.04] Of fields and floods, of fields and plains
[930.04 → 937.04] Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
[937.04 → 945.04] Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
[945.04 → 953.04] He rules the world with truth and grace
[953.04 → 961.04] And makes the nations grow
[961.04 → 968.04] The glories of His righteousness
[968.04 → 976.04] And wonders of His love
[976.04 → 984.04] And wonders of His love
[984.04 → 998.04] So God greets us this morning with these words from the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 14.
[998.04 → 1004.04] And you can see it in this fun little scripture graphic
[1004.04 → 1006.04] But it says this
[1006.04 → 1018.04] So God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another saying Merry Christmas.
[1018.04 → 1022.04] So God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another saying Merry Christmas.
[1022.04 → 1024.04] Merry Christmas.
[1024.04 → 1034.04] Merry Christmas.
[1034.04 → 1042.04] Merry Christmas.
[1042.04 → 1043.04] Merry Christmas.
[1043.04 → 1073.02] Thank you.
[1073.04 → 1103.02] Thank you.
[1103.04 → 1105.04] Thank you.
[1133.04 → 1135.04] Thank you.
[1163.04 → 1165.04] Thank you.
[1193.04 → 1195.04] Thank you.
[1195.04 → 1197.04] Thank you.
[1225.04 → 1227.04] Thank you.
[1255.04 → 1257.04] Thank you.
[1257.04 → 1259.04] Thank you.
[1259.04 → 1289.02] Thank you.
[1290.04 → 1291.04] Thank you.
[1291.04 → 1292.04] Thank you.
[1292.04 → 1293.04] Thank you.
[1293.04 → 1294.04] Thank you.
[1294.04 → 1296.92] on page 762 of your pew Bible.
[1304.78 → 1308.66] So Luke chapter 2, beginning in verse 1.
[1309.88 → 1313.96] In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[1313.96 → 1318.62] that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[1319.22 → 1321.86] This was the first census that took place
[1321.86 → 1324.14] while Quirinus was governor of Syria.
[1324.98 → 1327.80] And everyone went to their own town to register.
[1328.98 → 1333.34] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee
[1333.34 → 1336.70] to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[1337.40 → 1340.60] because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[1341.36 → 1343.74] He went there to register with Mary,
[1344.16 → 1346.08] who was pledged to be married to him
[1346.08 → 1348.36] and was expecting a child.
[1348.36 → 1352.48] While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.
[1352.90 → 1356.24] And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[1356.80 → 1359.82] And she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger
[1359.82 → 1363.34] because there was no room available for them.
[1364.12 → 1367.18] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
[1367.66 → 1369.88] keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[1370.38 → 1372.30] An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
[1372.52 → 1374.90] and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[1374.90 → 1376.04] and they were terrified.
[1377.12 → 1378.34] But the angel said to them,
[1378.68 → 1379.58] Do not be afraid.
[1380.32 → 1381.86] I bring you good news
[1381.86 → 1385.10] that will cause great joy for all the people.
[1386.04 → 1388.04] Today, in the town of David,
[1388.58 → 1390.80] a Saviour has been born to you.
[1391.10 → 1393.42] He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[1394.38 → 1395.56] This will be a sign to you.
[1395.64 → 1398.10] You will find a baby wrapped in cloths
[1398.10 → 1399.26] and lying in a manger.
[1399.26 → 1402.92] Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host
[1402.92 → 1405.00] appeared with the angel,
[1405.62 → 1406.98] praising God and saying,
[1407.40 → 1409.62] Glory to God in the highest heaven,
[1410.18 → 1413.88] and on earth, peace to those whom his favour rests.
[1415.04 → 1418.32] When the angels had left them and gone into heaven,
[1418.78 → 1420.54] the shepherds said to one another,
[1420.92 → 1424.12] Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[1424.46 → 1425.94] which the Lord has told us about.
[1425.94 → 1429.28] So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph
[1429.28 → 1431.62] in the baby who was lying in the manger.
[1432.52 → 1433.82] When they had seen him,
[1433.88 → 1435.58] they spread the word concerning
[1435.58 → 1437.94] what had been told them about this child.
[1438.48 → 1441.10] And all who heard it were amazed
[1441.10 → 1442.72] at what the shepherds said to them.
[1443.42 → 1445.60] But Mary treasured up all of these things
[1445.60 → 1447.14] and pondered them in her heart.
[1447.82 → 1449.24] The shepherds returned,
[1449.54 → 1451.00] glorifying and praising God
[1451.00 → 1453.34] for all the things they had heard and seen,
[1453.34 → 1455.70] which were just as they had been told.
[1456.44 → 1457.56] On the eighth day,
[1457.64 → 1459.68] when it was time to circumcise the child,
[1460.28 → 1462.08] he was named Jesus,
[1462.86 → 1464.80] the name the angel had given him
[1464.80 → 1466.82] before he was conceived.
[1467.72 → 1468.86] This is the word of the Lord.
[1470.70 → 1472.00] So let's stand again,
[1472.20 → 1474.18] and we'll sing two more songs,
[1474.34 → 1477.48] Your Name and Hark the Herald Angels Sing.
[1477.52 → 1478.20] Let's stand together.
[1478.20 → 1492.06] Him
[1492.06 → 1506.26] Jungly to the earth to pay
[1506.26 → 1511.60] Born into this world to save
[1511.60 → 1516.00] Come with us, Emmanuel
[1516.00 → 1521.46] And we adore your name
[1521.46 → 1527.16] Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[1527.16 → 1532.52] Your name is a shelter like no other
[1532.52 → 1537.84] Your name let the nations sing it louder
[1537.84 → 1542.68] For nothing has the power to save
[1542.68 → 1545.18] But your name
[1551.46 → 1559.02] Jesus, in your name we pray
[1559.02 → 1564.24] Come and fill our hearts today
[1564.24 → 1569.40] And give us strength to live for you
[1569.40 → 1573.96] And glorify your name
[1573.96 → 1579.56] Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[1579.56 → 1584.74] Your name is a shelter like no other
[1584.74 → 1589.90] Your name let the nations sing it louder
[1589.90 → 1593.86] For nothing has the power to save
[1593.86 → 1597.46] But your name
[1597.46 → 1602.60] Your name is a strong and mighty tower
[1602.60 → 1607.82] Your name is a shelter like no other
[1607.82 → 1613.52] Your name is a shelter like no other
[1613.52 → 1617.48] For nothing has the power to save
[1617.48 → 1621.08] But your name
[1621.08 → 1632.48] God with us, Emmanuel
[1632.48 → 1637.52] God with us, Emmanuel
[1637.52 → 1641.78] God with us, Emmanuel
[1641.78 → 1647.14] Now we adore your name
[1647.14 → 1658.20] Lord, may our angels sing
[1658.20 → 1677.02] Glory to the new Lord King
[1677.02 → 1681.86] Peace on earth and mercy, God
[1681.86 → 1686.58] God and sin are reconciled
[1686.58 → 1691.24] Join all the nations rise
[1691.24 → 1695.90] Join the triumph of the skies
[1695.90 → 1700.14] When angelic calls proclaim
[1700.14 → 1705.02] Christ is born in Bethlehem
[1705.02 → 1709.64] Hark the ear of angels sings
[1709.64 → 1715.12] Glory to the newborn King
[1715.12 → 1720.44] Christ the highest heaven-born King
[1720.44 → 1725.44] Christ the everlasting Lord
[1725.44 → 1730.90] Lord, may in time behold Him come
[1730.90 → 1735.62] Offspring of the virgin's womb
[1735.62 → 1740.44] Hail dim flesh the golden sea
[1740.44 → 1744.44] Hail dim heart the deity
[1744.44 → 1749.76] Please do God with us to dwell
[1749.76 → 1753.76] Jesus our Emmanuel
[1753.76 → 1759.20] Lord, may the herald angels sing
[1759.20 → 1763.76] Glory to the newborn King
[1763.76 → 1767.08] May the heaven-born King
[1767.08 → 1769.08] May the heaven-born King
[1769.08 → 1771.08] May the heaven-born King
[1771.08 → 1775.08] May the Son of Preciousness
[1775.08 → 1780.08] God turn life to all He brings
[1780.08 → 1783.08] His men free in His wings
[1783.08 → 1785.50] rafting His wings
[1785.50 → 1786.40] Mount Sheikh
[1786.40 → 1788.66] Mounted in His spirit
[1788.66 → 1790.40] Mounted in His court
[1790.40 → 1812.06] Long
[1813.08 → 1840.46] So the Christmas story is told in two of the Gospels, in Matthew and in Luke.
[1840.46 → 1844.48] And each one focuses on different parts of the story.
[1845.40 → 1852.00] So Luke focuses on Mary, and he holds her before us as the model disciple.
[1852.84 → 1859.20] I am the Lord's servant, she says to the angel, after learning that she would conceive the Messiah.
[1860.48 → 1867.34] But Matthew focuses not on Mary, but on Joseph, and holds him up as the model disciple.
[1867.34 → 1877.24] And because Joseph does not actually speak in the Christmas drama, many people refer to him as the forgotten man of Christmas.
[1878.62 → 1882.38] Yet his actions speak for him.
[1883.08 → 1893.90] And in the process, Joseph, the quiet, gentle carpenter, shows us what it means to be a disciple of his adopted son, Jesus Christ.
[1893.90 → 1901.36] And so on this Christmas morning, let's look to Joseph and how he experienced the Christmas story.
[1901.74 → 1905.92] So if you would, turn in your Bibles to the Gospel of Matthew.
[1906.16 → 1908.98] And we'll have the words on the screen if you'd like to follow along there.
[1909.92 → 1914.80] But I'll read from Matthew chapter 1, verses 18 to 25.
[1914.80 → 1920.86] This is how the birth of Jesus, the Messiah, came about.
[1921.86 → 1924.96] His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph.
[1925.48 → 1929.40] But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
[1930.32 → 1936.80] Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace,
[1937.36 → 1939.66] he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[1939.66 → 1944.74] But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[1945.16 → 1949.66] Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[1950.18 → 1952.74] because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[1953.56 → 1957.50] She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[1958.12 → 1961.04] because he will save his people from their sins.
[1961.04 → 1967.74] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet,
[1968.26 → 1973.20] the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,
[1974.06 → 1976.16] which means God with us.
[1976.80 → 1980.82] When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him,
[1981.10 → 1983.24] and took Mary home as his wife.
[1983.74 → 1987.68] But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son,
[1987.68 → 1991.58] and he gave him the name Jesus.
[1992.72 → 1993.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[1995.56 → 1998.82] Let's pray, and let's ask for God's blessing upon his word this morning.
[1999.58 → 2002.30] Heavenly Father, as we open your word on this Christmas morning,
[2002.46 → 2005.94] may your Holy Spirit, Lord, speak to each one of us,
[2006.46 → 2009.96] so that we may behold the mystery of the birth of our Saviour,
[2010.76 → 2015.34] and receive it into our hearts, and allow it to then change our lives.
[2015.34 → 2017.78] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2019.06 → 2021.54] So when we first meet Joseph in the story,
[2022.00 → 2025.92] we actually find him in the midst of a personal crisis.
[2027.12 → 2030.54] He is in deep emotional distress and pain.
[2031.12 → 2034.36] And if you've ever been betrayed by someone you trusted,
[2034.86 → 2037.10] you will know something of what he is feeling.
[2038.00 → 2042.66] He was engaged to be married to Mary, a lovely young lady.
[2042.66 → 2045.18] And during the engagement period,
[2045.74 → 2049.50] the man and the woman would not live together for about a year
[2049.50 → 2051.64] as they prepared for the wedding.
[2052.62 → 2056.64] And as they waited, Joseph and surely Mary as well
[2056.64 → 2058.92] were dreaming of love and happiness.
[2060.06 → 2062.32] The love and happiness that they would share together
[2062.32 → 2065.02] in their new life once they were married.
[2065.64 → 2067.82] And they looked forward to the wedding ceremony,
[2067.82 → 2071.92] when the whole village would gather to celebrate
[2071.92 → 2074.46] and to bless this new couple.
[2075.94 → 2078.66] But then comes the shocking news.
[2079.04 → 2079.96] Mary is pregnant.
[2081.26 → 2083.74] And they have never been intimate with each other.
[2085.12 → 2087.62] Joseph was stunned, to say the least,
[2088.20 → 2089.22] and deeply hurt.
[2089.22 → 2091.90] How could Mary do this?
[2092.34 → 2093.42] To herself?
[2093.80 → 2094.64] To him?
[2095.36 → 2096.66] To their families?
[2096.98 → 2097.90] To their God?
[2099.02 → 2101.38] The only logical explanation
[2101.38 → 2104.70] is that Mary was not faithful
[2104.70 → 2106.60] to her engagement vows.
[2107.32 → 2108.76] The only logical explanation
[2108.76 → 2110.94] is that Mary had committed adultery.
[2112.26 → 2113.66] So now this morning,
[2114.34 → 2115.88] let's think for a minute
[2115.88 → 2118.40] about what it would have been like to be Joseph.
[2119.22 → 2121.70] Put yourself in his shoes
[2121.70 → 2125.44] as he wrestles with what is going on.
[2126.52 → 2129.74] And I want us to reflect on how he wrestles,
[2129.84 → 2132.66] both before and after he learns the mystery.
[2133.50 → 2137.18] Joseph shows us what discipleship looks like,
[2137.44 → 2142.20] both before and after he's told the mystery of Christmas.
[2142.86 → 2146.06] The mystery that what is going on in Mary's life
[2146.06 → 2147.58] is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2147.58 → 2151.44] So look at how he wrestles with what is happening
[2151.44 → 2153.94] before he hears the mystery.
[2155.30 → 2157.16] Matthew tells us that Joseph
[2157.16 → 2159.70] was faithful to the law.
[2160.40 → 2162.68] It means that Joseph was a righteous man.
[2163.50 → 2165.80] He lived in right relationship,
[2166.48 → 2168.42] and especially in right relationship
[2168.42 → 2170.00] with the living God.
[2170.54 → 2172.10] Joseph wanted to be faithful to God.
[2172.10 → 2174.62] And in the law of Moses,
[2174.62 → 2175.58] when a woman is unfaithful,
[2175.58 → 2178.16] she is to be taken to the court
[2178.16 → 2179.90] and publicly exposed
[2179.90 → 2181.78] for having broken the legal bond.
[2182.78 → 2184.68] Joseph even has the right
[2184.68 → 2186.64] to have her stoned to death
[2186.64 → 2188.42] outside the city gates
[2188.42 → 2189.82] as an adulterer.
[2190.76 → 2194.02] But as righteous Joseph struggles in his pain,
[2194.26 → 2197.12] he chooses not to exercise his legal right.
[2197.12 → 2200.66] And although he seeks a right relationship with God,
[2200.98 → 2203.26] he also seeks a right relationship with Mary.
[2203.48 → 2205.98] He does not want to publicly shame her.
[2207.02 → 2207.58] Why?
[2208.78 → 2211.64] There was no social or cultural reasons why.
[2212.38 → 2214.46] I think probably because he loved Mary.
[2214.46 → 2216.78] I think Joseph loved Mary.
[2217.46 → 2218.54] He didn't want to shame her.
[2219.16 → 2221.60] So he chose to go to Mary secretly.
[2222.64 → 2223.70] And according to the law,
[2223.80 → 2225.98] he is to take two witnesses with him
[2225.98 → 2229.00] who will then sign a certificate of divorce.
[2231.32 → 2233.44] So let's think about Joseph's decision
[2233.44 → 2236.10] in this terrible situation.
[2236.86 → 2240.58] As he wrestles with what begins as a nightmare,
[2241.48 → 2244.34] Joseph is able to rise above his personal pain
[2244.34 → 2245.88] and to seek righteousness,
[2246.56 → 2247.62] right-relatedness,
[2247.68 → 2250.02] not only with the law that he loves,
[2250.10 → 2252.50] but also with the lady that he loves.
[2254.04 → 2256.62] Before he learns the mystery from the angel,
[2257.08 → 2260.36] Joseph illustrates one of the great tensions
[2260.36 → 2262.42] of what it means to be a disciple,
[2263.12 → 2264.78] what it means to live in faith.
[2264.78 → 2268.30] And it's the tension between truth and grace,
[2269.06 → 2270.98] between grace and truth.
[2272.10 → 2273.64] Following Christ in this world
[2273.64 → 2275.20] means living in the tension
[2275.20 → 2277.12] of truth and grace,
[2277.96 → 2279.00] grace and truth.
[2279.80 → 2280.60] On the one hand,
[2280.70 → 2282.74] never watering down God's holy law.
[2283.54 → 2284.60] On the other hand,
[2284.94 → 2286.94] extending mercy to those who break the law.
[2287.66 → 2288.90] And it's not easy to do.
[2289.90 → 2293.26] Most of us lean on one side or the other.
[2294.40 → 2295.94] But faithful discipleship
[2295.94 → 2297.46] means doing what Joseph did,
[2297.46 → 2301.60] living with both feet firmly planted in grace and truth,
[2301.74 → 2303.28] without giving up either,
[2303.78 → 2305.58] and doing both simultaneously.
[2306.58 → 2306.80] Right?
[2306.84 → 2309.06] Being passionately committed to God
[2309.06 → 2310.62] and his revealed truth,
[2311.12 → 2314.12] and doing so with uncommon grace.
[2315.28 → 2316.96] And Joseph models this for us.
[2317.80 → 2317.98] Right?
[2318.04 → 2319.62] Before learning the mystery of Christmas,
[2319.62 → 2321.10] he lives in this tension,
[2321.24 → 2323.68] and he shows us how to be a disciple
[2323.68 → 2325.84] of his adopted son, Jesus.
[2326.56 → 2326.78] Right?
[2326.82 → 2327.52] Because Jesus,
[2327.90 → 2329.92] who we are told in the Gospel of John,
[2330.22 → 2331.20] came from the Father,
[2331.54 → 2332.24] full of what?
[2333.30 → 2335.22] Grace and truth.
[2336.30 → 2337.00] And Jesus,
[2337.14 → 2339.24] who would live out this tension perfectly,
[2339.92 → 2342.46] when he says to the woman caught in adultery,
[2342.82 → 2344.16] neither do I condemn you,
[2344.96 → 2346.46] go now and live your life,
[2347.40 → 2348.86] leave your life of sin.
[2349.54 → 2350.26] So grace,
[2350.64 → 2351.86] neither do I condemn you.
[2352.24 → 2352.68] Truth,
[2353.16 → 2356.00] go now and leave your life of sin.
[2358.22 → 2358.98] And so now,
[2359.08 → 2362.30] after what was surely the most horrible day,
[2362.40 → 2364.12] the worst day of his entire life,
[2364.64 → 2365.80] Joseph goes to bed,
[2366.34 → 2367.82] and while he's sleeping,
[2368.06 → 2370.52] God sends an angel to Joseph in a dream,
[2370.86 → 2375.18] to explain that what feels to Joseph like a nightmare,
[2375.88 → 2376.34] is not.
[2377.16 → 2379.74] The angel tells Joseph the mystery of Christmas.
[2380.14 → 2381.40] What is conceived in her,
[2381.72 → 2382.62] is of the Holy Spirit.
[2383.58 → 2384.90] Of the Holy Spirit.
[2386.06 → 2388.50] That is what explains this strange,
[2389.20 → 2390.76] bewildering thing,
[2390.86 → 2392.94] that is happening in Mary and Joseph's life.
[2393.00 → 2393.90] It's from the Holy Spirit.
[2394.94 → 2395.06] Right?
[2395.18 → 2396.34] God is working.
[2396.58 → 2397.52] God is on the move.
[2398.44 → 2400.26] He had promised long ago,
[2400.26 → 2402.18] that he would send the Messiah,
[2402.34 → 2403.86] the promised one,
[2404.26 → 2405.80] who would crush the head of the serpent,
[2405.80 → 2409.54] who would sit on the throne of his father David,
[2410.34 → 2412.66] who would be the saviour of Israel.
[2413.20 → 2414.52] The mystery of Christmas,
[2415.26 → 2417.02] is that God is fulfilling his promise.
[2417.82 → 2420.52] And the promise is revealed in the name,
[2420.88 → 2423.16] that Joseph is to give Mary's child.
[2423.82 → 2424.42] Name him,
[2425.32 → 2426.06] the angel says,
[2426.22 → 2427.12] name him Jesus.
[2428.12 → 2428.64] Jeshua.
[2430.14 → 2432.40] Yahweh is salvation.
[2433.34 → 2434.38] Yahweh saves.
[2434.38 → 2435.38] Yahweh is salvation.
[2435.38 → 2437.72] This child can only be called Jesus,
[2437.82 → 2440.26] because that is what he is.
[2440.48 → 2441.72] That is who he is.
[2442.50 → 2443.96] He is God to the rescue.
[2444.16 → 2445.14] God who saves.
[2446.06 → 2448.02] And which is why the angel further says,
[2448.24 → 2452.24] because he will save his people from their sins.
[2452.58 → 2457.98] He will save his people from their sins.
[2457.98 → 2462.62] The mystery of Christmas is that this child is God himself,
[2463.08 → 2465.92] who will save his people.
[2466.64 → 2468.48] He will come to save his people,
[2468.92 → 2471.98] which is why he is also called Emmanuel,
[2472.54 → 2473.88] God with us.
[2475.16 → 2475.62] Joseph,
[2476.04 → 2479.60] your beloved Mary has not been unfaithful to you.
[2480.48 → 2483.42] What is going on is that God is being faithful
[2483.42 → 2486.66] to his promise to save his people.
[2489.56 → 2494.38] Then the angel tells Joseph how he is to participate in the mystery,
[2494.50 → 2495.62] how he is to live into it.
[2496.48 → 2497.26] The angel says,
[2497.76 → 2499.48] take Mary as your wife,
[2499.86 → 2501.98] and give the child the name Jesus.
[2503.44 → 2503.66] You know,
[2503.74 → 2504.76] and to be told,
[2505.64 → 2507.22] to name Mary's child,
[2507.30 → 2509.00] is a technical way of saying,
[2509.32 → 2509.92] adopt him.
[2509.92 → 2511.94] Make him your own.
[2512.24 → 2512.46] Joseph,
[2512.58 → 2514.32] you did not father this little child,
[2514.56 → 2518.40] but you are to take him into your heart as your own child.
[2519.08 → 2520.80] You are to officially adopt him.
[2521.94 → 2523.28] And Joseph does,
[2523.92 → 2525.50] at great risk.
[2526.50 → 2527.38] And that too,
[2527.86 → 2530.52] is what Joseph teaches us about discipleship.
[2531.58 → 2531.82] Right?
[2531.90 → 2533.74] To believe the mystery of Christmas,
[2534.26 → 2535.76] and then to live the mystery,
[2535.76 → 2540.78] Joseph runs the risk of losing his reputation.
[2542.20 → 2542.80] Right?
[2542.90 → 2543.76] Up to this point,
[2543.92 → 2546.04] Joseph had a sterling reputation.
[2546.58 → 2549.40] As a man of integrity and holiness,
[2549.60 → 2550.54] faithful to the law.
[2551.54 → 2552.56] But the angel says,
[2552.68 → 2552.94] Joseph,
[2553.12 → 2556.36] don't be afraid to take Mary home as your wife.
[2558.30 → 2560.96] If he does as the angel says,
[2560.96 → 2564.06] if he takes Mary home as his wife,
[2564.44 → 2567.20] Joseph's friends and family are going to say,
[2567.80 → 2567.96] look,
[2568.04 → 2568.32] Joseph,
[2568.44 → 2569.70] we know how this works.
[2570.64 → 2571.38] Either A,
[2571.50 → 2573.98] you got Mary pregnant before the wedding,
[2574.40 → 2575.22] or B,
[2575.42 → 2576.78] she was unfaithful to you.
[2576.98 → 2578.64] Those are the only two options.
[2579.92 → 2584.20] How is Joseph going to explain this to his family and his friends?
[2585.70 → 2585.90] Well,
[2585.94 → 2587.26] he could tell them the truth.
[2587.88 → 2589.22] It was the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2589.22 → 2589.94] Right.
[2590.68 → 2591.12] Right.
[2591.78 → 2592.22] Joseph.
[2592.34 → 2593.34] We've heard that one before.
[2594.08 → 2594.18] Right?
[2594.34 → 2595.56] Who is going to believe him?
[2597.08 → 2599.02] In an honour-shame society,
[2599.38 → 2603.32] Joseph will be demoted to a second-class citizen forever.
[2604.34 → 2606.34] He will be socially excluded.
[2606.72 → 2608.14] His business will suffer.
[2608.46 → 2609.76] His friendships will suffer.
[2610.54 → 2612.10] His family will be shamed.
[2613.46 → 2617.36] And when we embrace Christ,
[2618.00 → 2618.94] so will we.
[2620.04 → 2620.18] Right?
[2620.22 → 2621.62] To believe the mystery of Christmas,
[2622.08 → 2622.20] right,
[2622.24 → 2625.94] that a virgin conceived a child by the Holy Spirit,
[2626.22 → 2628.46] and that actually he is the Saviour of the world,
[2628.58 → 2629.46] that's what we believe.
[2630.04 → 2630.44] Right?
[2630.48 → 2634.06] That does not fit within the worldview of our day.
[2634.90 → 2636.32] It didn't in that day either.
[2637.60 → 2641.12] And so we have to realize that welcoming Jesus into our lives,
[2641.60 → 2642.80] identifying with him,
[2642.96 → 2643.58] obeying him,
[2643.62 → 2645.54] will always come at a social cost.
[2645.54 → 2647.78] And this has always been true.
[2648.32 → 2649.12] This is not new.
[2650.32 → 2655.72] And Joseph shows incredible courage to face losing his reputation.
[2655.72 → 2658.12] But that's not all.
[2658.12 → 2659.72] To believe the mystery,
[2659.94 → 2660.86] to live the mystery,
[2661.78 → 2665.42] Joseph will actually have to submit his whole life to God.
[2666.42 → 2667.06] Right?
[2667.06 → 2669.56] In a first century patriarchal society,
[2669.56 → 2673.80] it was the father's unquestionable right to name the child,
[2674.90 → 2677.82] symbolically representing his right to govern the family.
[2678.48 → 2682.52] But the angel shows up and tells Joseph what to name the child,
[2682.52 → 2688.44] signifying to Joseph that he is not going to be in charge of this child.
[2689.58 → 2690.10] Right?
[2690.18 → 2695.56] The angel isn't coming and helping Joseph choose a name from like a Hebrew baby name book.
[2696.36 → 2697.88] He is telling Joseph,
[2698.06 → 2700.24] you are not in charge of your life anymore.
[2701.62 → 2703.28] And it's the same for us.
[2704.30 → 2704.50] Right?
[2704.54 → 2706.40] When Jesus enters your life,
[2706.58 → 2711.78] you cannot expect things to be the same as they were before he came into your life.
[2712.52 → 2715.88] And as people today living in the 21st century,
[2716.60 → 2721.46] we hold very tightly to our right of self-determination.
[2721.76 → 2722.44] It is my life.
[2722.50 → 2723.88] I will live it however I want.
[2725.16 → 2730.32] However, the Christian faith requires us to give up this right at the door.
[2731.80 → 2733.24] And this makes us afraid.
[2734.32 → 2738.52] What will God do to me if I let him be in charge of my life?
[2739.36 → 2741.22] Where will he send me?
[2741.22 → 2745.34] What is following Christ going to cost me?
[2746.04 → 2747.80] What else will I have to give up?
[2749.20 → 2750.58] The angel said to Joseph,
[2750.72 → 2752.24] you are to give him the name Jesus.
[2753.24 → 2754.22] And he did.
[2754.48 → 2755.76] He submitted to God.
[2756.64 → 2757.80] He believed the mystery.
[2758.22 → 2759.40] He lived the mystery,
[2760.04 → 2762.50] giving up his right to be in charge of his own life.
[2762.50 → 2764.70] And in doing so,
[2764.76 → 2769.32] he shows us today what it means to be a disciple of his adopted son, Jesus.
[2770.38 → 2770.60] Right?
[2770.72 → 2772.26] Jesus, in order to be our saviour,
[2772.60 → 2774.36] he gave up his good reputation.
[2775.22 → 2777.16] He was falsely accused,
[2777.94 → 2778.24] sentenced,
[2778.54 → 2782.42] and executed as a theological heretic
[2782.42 → 2785.78] who didn't obey the law of Moses,
[2786.10 → 2788.18] and as a political revolutionary,
[2788.98 → 2790.12] neither of which were true.
[2791.78 → 2793.84] And Jesus, in order to be our saviour,
[2794.24 → 2795.38] he gave up his rights.
[2796.38 → 2797.74] And in the garden of Gethsemane,
[2797.84 → 2800.28] as Jesus knelt, and he prayed before God the Father,
[2800.74 → 2801.18] he said,
[2801.18 → 2802.90] not my will,
[2803.78 → 2804.90] but your will.
[2805.54 → 2806.14] Be done.
[2806.74 → 2809.80] That is a total surrendering of rights.
[2812.08 → 2815.16] So after learning the mystery of Christmas from the angel,
[2816.16 → 2818.88] there were still a lot of things that Joseph did not know
[2818.88 → 2820.72] what his life would look like.
[2821.98 → 2825.64] All he had to go on was the word of God from the angel,
[2826.08 → 2826.28] saying,
[2826.62 → 2827.54] take Mary as your wife,
[2828.40 → 2829.80] give the child the name Jesus,
[2829.80 → 2833.52] for he will save his people from their sins.
[2834.20 → 2835.66] So friends, on this Christmas day,
[2836.86 → 2840.14] Joseph shows us what it means to be a disciple
[2840.14 → 2842.18] of his adopted son.
[2842.88 → 2845.34] And he stands before each one of us
[2845.34 → 2846.44] in the pages of scripture.
[2846.98 → 2850.08] Joseph stands here as the model disciple,
[2850.26 → 2851.84] and he poses the question to us,
[2852.18 → 2854.96] will you embrace the saviour
[2854.96 → 2858.14] who is Emmanuel, God with us?
[2858.14 → 2859.98] And you can,
[2861.02 → 2864.00] because the same Jesus who came to Joseph
[2864.00 → 2867.34] is the same Jesus who comes to you and me.
[2868.30 → 2869.34] So let's pray together.
[2872.92 → 2875.06] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord,
[2875.12 → 2877.32] for sending your son, Jesus Christ,
[2877.38 → 2878.42] to be our saviour,
[2878.88 → 2881.30] to be God with us,
[2881.30 → 2882.68] for not leaving us alone,
[2882.78 → 2886.08] but drawing near and dwelling among us.
[2887.18 → 2888.94] Lord, thank you for Joseph.
[2889.56 → 2891.62] Thank you for the ways that he models for us
[2891.62 → 2892.94] what it means to be a disciple,
[2893.50 → 2896.58] to live in the tension of truth and grace,
[2896.82 → 2900.18] to have the courage to lose our reputation,
[2900.18 → 2903.84] and to give up being in charge of our own lives
[2903.84 → 2906.28] as we submit our lives to you.
[2907.02 → 2908.86] Would you help us, Lord, by your Holy Spirit,
[2909.50 → 2912.82] the same spirit who brought about the birth of Christ,
[2913.54 → 2915.68] and it's in his holy name that we pray.
[2916.12 → 2916.42] Amen.
[2916.42 → 2916.52] Amen.
[2916.52 → 2916.58] Amen.

[2960.16 → 2965.16] Amen.
[2990.16 → 2996.04] The mountain that Jesus Christ is born
[2996.04 → 3000.00] Shepherds fit and travel
[3000.00 → 3004.58] When low above the earth
[3004.58 → 3008.16] Rang up the angel chorus
[3008.76 → 3013.04] The endless Saviour's glory
[3013.04 → 3018.16] The mountain and the mountain
[3018.16 → 3022.96] All the hills and every one
[3022.96 → 3026.42] The mountain and the mountain
[3026.42 → 3030.72] Now Jesus Christ is born
[3030.72 → 3034.80] Now in the lowly nature
[3034.80 → 3038.90] The humble Christ was born
[3038.90 → 3042.96] And God sent us salvation
[3042.96 → 3046.96] Now blessed the Christmas moon
[3046.96 → 3053.34] Oh, Lord, down the mountain
[3053.34 → 3058.12] The mountain and the hills and every one
[3058.12 → 3061.64] Lord, down the mountain
[3061.64 → 3065.80] Lord Jesus Christ is born
[3065.80 → 3085.52] Let's come now before the Lord in prayer as we rejoice that Christ is ours and that we are his.
[3086.18 → 3087.00] Let's pray together.
[3087.00 → 3091.48] Father in heaven, we thank you, Lord, for this glorious morning.
[3091.92 → 3096.34] We thank you for the joy of gathering as your people, all of us together.
[3097.12 → 3100.16] Father, it is a joy to be a family in Christ.
[3100.90 → 3105.38] And still more a joy to know that you have blessed us with the birth of a Saviour.
[3105.38 → 3110.06] Of a Saviour who is the only-begotten Son of God
[3110.06 → 3112.98] Who has come to make all things right
[3112.98 → 3116.02] To pay for all the debts that we owe
[3116.02 → 3119.56] To earn all the blessings that we long for.
[3120.84 → 3124.86] Father, the scriptures teach us that it's not the powerful, and it's not the proud
[3124.86 → 3126.70] Who will inherit the earth
[3126.70 → 3128.68] And enjoy great peace
[3128.68 → 3130.30] But it is the meek.
[3131.52 → 3134.34] Therefore, Father, we praise you for the meekness of Jesus
[3134.34 → 3137.20] Born in the manger
[3137.20 → 3139.80] In the likeness of a servant
[3139.80 → 3141.80] Being found in human flesh
[3141.80 → 3143.52] Yet without sin
[3143.52 → 3145.56] And like a lamb
[3145.56 → 3147.24] The meekness of a lamb
[3147.24 → 3148.34] The very lamb of God
[3148.34 → 3149.54] He was led to the cross
[3149.54 → 3151.62] Taking there our sin
[3151.62 → 3154.70] But defeating evil and rising again
[3154.70 → 3156.72] Securing for us
[3156.72 → 3159.16] The restoration of all things
[3159.16 → 3161.70] And it's in union with Jesus
[3161.70 → 3163.54] That you, Father, by your Holy Spirit
[3163.54 → 3164.82] Are remaking us
[3164.82 → 3167.42] Teaching us humility and meekness
[3167.42 → 3171.28] Calling us into your kingdom service
[3171.28 → 3174.10] Therefore, O Lord, we ask you
[3174.10 → 3177.90] To forgive our fearful fretting
[3177.90 → 3180.82] Our cynical unbelief
[3180.82 → 3182.66] Our bitter musings
[3182.66 → 3186.52] Teach us that vengeance belongs to you and not to us
[3186.52 → 3191.12] And that our wickedness deserves your judgment just as much
[3191.12 → 3193.20] As it requires your grace
[3193.20 → 3195.22] Lord, make us meek
[3195.22 → 3198.18] A meek people who grieve at evil
[3198.18 → 3200.08] But who live with hope
[3200.08 → 3201.40] As your sons and daughters
[3201.40 → 3204.34] Father, may your joy be our strength
[3204.34 → 3206.60] May your promise be our confidence
[3206.60 → 3208.96] May you're timing be our schedule
[3208.96 → 3213.28] We also pray, Lord, for the needs of our congregation
[3213.28 → 3215.78] We especially pray this morning for Wilma Van Toll
[3215.78 → 3217.94] We pray that as she is in the hospital
[3217.94 → 3220.28] Lord, would you give the doctors wisdom
[3220.28 → 3221.92] And let the peace
[3221.92 → 3226.20] Especially, Lord, that surpasses all understanding
[3226.20 → 3228.46] Surround her and be upon her
[3228.46 → 3230.56] Father, we pray this morning
[3230.56 → 3234.86] As we rejoice and celebrate this Christmas day
[3234.86 → 3238.00] Lord, not only now, but throughout the rest of our day
[3238.00 → 3240.26] Would we rejoice with the angels
[3240.26 → 3242.28] And with all heaven
[3242.28 → 3243.84] At the birth of our King
[3243.84 → 3246.50] We ask this in Christ's name
[3246.50 → 3247.60] Amen
[3247.60 → 3271.38] One-star falls in the darkness
[3271.38 → 3274.40] Shines with the promise
[3274.40 → 3275.40] Amen
[3275.40 → 3282.74] One-star falls in the stillness
[3282.74 → 3285.54] Living within us
[3285.54 → 3286.40] Amen
[3286.40 → 3291.60] We're singing glory
[3291.60 → 3297.28] Let him be peace
[3297.28 → 3300.04] Let him be peace
[3300.04 → 3302.54] Sing in glory
[3302.54 → 3305.02] Glory
[3305.02 → 3308.18] Let him be peace
[3308.18 → 3311.92] Let him start in me
[3311.92 → 3316.98] One voice speaks for the voices
[3316.98 → 3319.98] One for the hopeless
[3319.98 → 3325.18] By the imprint
[3325.18 → 3327.46] One
[3327.46 → 3328.66] Lord, we think
[3329.38 → 3330.50] Been left
[3330.50 → 3331.72] And we think
[3331.72 → 3331.94] Ah
