[1684.86 → 1687.60] It is good to be here again
[1687.60 → 1689.36] This morning with you
[1689.36 → 1691.52] On this long weekend
[1691.52 → 1693.26] I thought I was doing
[1693.26 → 1694.98] Pastor Jason a favour
[1694.98 → 1696.16] By agreeing to preach
[1696.16 → 1696.84] On the long weekend
[1696.84 → 1698.10] Because it's usually pretty tough
[1698.10 → 1699.10] Slogging on a long weekend
[1699.10 → 1701.28] With a very empty sanctuary
[1701.28 → 1702.32] But you guys seem to have
[1702.32 → 1703.10] Brought more people in
[1703.10 → 1704.44] On the long weekend
[1704.44 → 1705.30] So I guess Ladder's
[1705.30 → 1706.14] A good destination
[1706.14 → 1708.08] For the long weekend
[1708.08 → 1708.92] But it is wonderful
[1708.92 → 1710.78] To be here this morning
[1710.78 → 1711.78] To bring God's word
[1711.78 → 1713.18] To you
[1713.18 → 1714.52] This morning
[1714.52 → 1716.30] Now our sermon this morning
[1716.30 → 1717.52] I'll admit right off the bat
[1717.52 → 1717.68] Is
[1717.68 → 1718.84] It's pretty full
[1718.84 → 1719.64] We're going to move
[1719.64 → 1720.48] Pretty fast
[1720.48 → 1721.78] I encourage you not to
[1721.78 → 1723.62] Try to catch every single
[1723.62 → 1724.96] Little thing I say
[1724.96 → 1726.96] But listen for the point
[1726.96 → 1727.54] For the theme
[1727.54 → 1728.34] We're going to be talking about
[1728.34 → 1729.14] The different themes
[1729.14 → 1730.04] In the book of John
[1730.04 → 1731.60] Listen for the theme
[1731.60 → 1733.36] That really maybe resonates with you
[1733.36 → 1734.46] Where you're at
[1734.46 → 1735.66] In your life today
[1735.66 → 1737.50] As I said
[1737.50 → 1738.56] This morning we're going to be
[1738.56 → 1739.46] Like taking a look
[1739.46 → 1740.30] A broad look
[1740.30 → 1742.00] At the Gospel of John
[1742.00 → 1743.32] Now on the one hand
[1743.32 → 1744.20] The Gospel of John
[1744.20 → 1745.50] Is kind of complicated
[1745.50 → 1746.80] But on the other hand
[1746.80 → 1748.54] It's very, very simple
[1748.54 → 1750.28] It's incredibly rich
[1750.28 → 1751.14] With symbols
[1751.14 → 1752.18] Or signs
[1752.18 → 1753.54] As we're going to talk about
[1753.54 → 1754.48] This morning
[1754.48 → 1756.26] But it's also very simple
[1756.26 → 1758.16] In that the Gospel of John
[1758.16 → 1759.54] Has one theme
[1759.54 → 1761.04] And it's summed up
[1761.04 → 1763.90] In two very simple sentences
[1763.90 → 1765.44] Right near the end of his gospel
[1765.44 → 1766.86] And that is our text this morning
[1766.86 → 1770.20] John 20 verses 30 to 31
[1770.20 → 1772.80] Should be on the screen behind me
[1772.80 → 1776.88] A reading this morning
[1776.88 → 1779.46] John 20 verses 30 to 31
[1779.46 → 1781.28] This is after Jesus
[1781.28 → 1782.72] Rises from the dead
[1782.72 → 1784.40] John writes
[1784.40 → 1786.04] Jesus performed
[1786.04 → 1787.34] Many other signs
[1787.34 → 1788.94] In the presence of his disciples
[1788.94 → 1790.50] Which are not recorded
[1790.50 → 1791.34] In this book
[1791.34 → 1792.86] But these are written
[1792.86 → 1794.32] That you may believe
[1794.32 → 1796.22] That Jesus is the Messiah
[1796.22 → 1797.44] The Son of God
[1797.44 → 1798.80] And that by believing
[1798.80 → 1800.68] You may have life
[1800.68 → 1802.28] In his name
[1802.28 → 1804.38] This is the word of the Lord
[1804.38 → 1805.32] Amen
[1805.32 → 1808.24] Now the Gospel of John
[1808.24 → 1809.50] Is sometimes called
[1809.50 → 1811.10] The book of signs
[1811.10 → 1812.92] The first half of John
[1812.92 → 1814.20] Chapter 1 through 12
[1814.20 → 1815.82] There are seven signs
[1815.82 → 1816.66] In the other gospels
[1816.66 → 1817.66] We call them miracles
[1817.66 → 1819.82] John calls them signs
[1819.82 → 1821.86] And they point to who Jesus is
[1821.86 → 1823.10] The eighth kind of sign
[1823.10 → 1824.94] Takes up the whole second half of John
[1824.94 → 1827.20] Which is the death and resurrection of Jesus
[1827.20 → 1830.40] But we're going to look at these seven main signs
[1830.40 → 1832.30] That John tells us right here
[1832.30 → 1834.16] Is how we believe who Jesus is
[1834.16 → 1837.14] And how we have life in his name
[1837.14 → 1840.36] Now John selects these seven miracles
[1840.36 → 1842.42] Out of the whole gamut of the miracles
[1842.42 → 1844.36] Jesus performs
[1844.36 → 1847.24] To point out as I said who Jesus is
[1847.24 → 1850.00] Now what are signs?
[1850.74 → 1852.44] Well signs are always something
[1852.44 → 1854.52] That point to something else
[1854.52 → 1856.84] They point to a deeper reality
[1856.84 → 1859.04] Think of what road signs are
[1859.04 → 1860.90] We don't go up to a road sign
[1860.90 → 1861.64] And kind of worship
[1861.64 → 1862.74] And look at that road sign
[1862.74 → 1863.94] And think what a good road sign
[1863.94 → 1865.28] A road sign points
[1865.28 → 1866.66] To a different reality
[1866.66 → 1868.46] It points to the reality of the road
[1868.46 → 1869.60] It tells us to stop
[1869.60 → 1871.32] Or our lives could be in peril
[1871.32 → 1872.74] It tells us to merge
[1872.74 → 1874.22] And to show us how to drive
[1874.22 → 1876.28] And how the road works
[1876.28 → 1877.42] And this morning
[1877.42 → 1878.98] We're going to look at these seven signs
[1878.98 → 1880.94] And to see what is the life
[1880.94 → 1883.04] That Jesus desires for us
[1883.04 → 1885.70] And the first sign that Jesus gives us
[1885.70 → 1886.74] Or that John gives us
[1886.74 → 1887.84] That Jesus performs
[1887.84 → 1890.18] Is turning water into wine
[1890.18 → 1891.58] In John 2
[1891.58 → 1895.34] And this is a sign of joy
[1895.34 → 1897.70] It is a sign or a miracle
[1897.70 → 1898.84] Where Jesus performs
[1898.84 → 1900.28] At that wedding in Cana
[1900.28 → 1901.90] Where he takes the water that is there
[1901.90 → 1903.60] And he turns it into wine
[1903.60 → 1904.54] See the people
[1904.54 → 1905.88] The bridegroom's family
[1905.88 → 1907.04] Was running out of wine
[1907.04 → 1908.52] And all they had was water left
[1908.52 → 1910.34] And this was a huge embarrassment
[1910.34 → 1911.16] For the people
[1911.16 → 1912.76] It would bring great shame
[1912.76 → 1914.72] To the family of this bridegroom
[1914.72 → 1916.10] For them to run out of wine
[1916.10 → 1917.10] At the wedding
[1917.10 → 1919.12] But what Jesus does here
[1919.12 → 1920.74] In turning this water into wine
[1920.74 → 1923.12] Is so much more than just a party trick
[1923.12 → 1925.66] But it's actually a sign of who he is
[1925.66 → 1927.60] And the life that he brings
[1927.60 → 1929.64] In John 2 verse 6
[1929.64 → 1930.20] It says
[1930.20 → 1934.58] Nearby stood six stone water jars
[1934.58 → 1936.52] The kind used by the Jews
[1936.52 → 1937.86] For ceremonial washing
[1937.86 → 1941.14] Each holding from 20 to 30 gallons
[1941.14 → 1942.96] This is the water
[1942.96 → 1943.98] That Jesus uses
[1943.98 → 1945.46] To turn into wine
[1945.46 → 1947.36] Now this is not just any water
[1947.36 → 1948.32] But as we read
[1948.32 → 1950.00] This was water that was used
[1950.00 → 1951.10] For the Old Testament
[1951.10 → 1952.90] Rite of purification
[1952.90 → 1955.12] This water that Jesus takes
[1955.12 → 1956.86] Represents the old order
[1956.86 → 1958.88] Of the Jewish law and custom
[1958.88 → 1961.12] The exact thing he came
[1961.12 → 1962.58] As the son of God
[1962.58 → 1963.44] To fulfill
[1963.44 → 1966.84] The water that is then turned into wine
[1966.84 → 1969.06] Is a symbol of joy
[1969.06 → 1971.58] Wine is a symbol of joy
[1971.58 → 1974.68] It is a symbol of the heavenly banquet
[1974.68 → 1976.56] What Jesus is doing here
[1976.56 → 1977.96] Is he is taking these signs
[1977.96 → 1980.14] Which represent slavery to sin
[1980.14 → 1981.82] And he is turning them
[1981.82 → 1984.80] Into joy of the heavenly banquet
[1984.80 → 1987.28] The heavenly banquet that Jesus came
[1987.28 → 1989.92] To inaugurate with his incarnation
[1989.92 → 1991.94] But so often
[1991.94 → 1994.76] We kind of like to turn this sign
[1994.76 → 1995.86] On its head
[1995.86 → 1997.20] In the way we live
[1997.20 → 1999.34] We trade the meaning of the sign
[1999.34 → 2001.18] For the sign itself
[2001.18 → 2002.62] So often in our lives
[2002.62 → 2004.50] We exchange the heavenly joy
[2004.50 → 2005.94] That Christ wants to give us
[2005.94 → 2007.22] For simple happiness
[2007.22 → 2008.72] In this life
[2008.72 → 2010.00] We chase happiness
[2010.00 → 2011.50] For all it is worth
[2011.50 → 2013.36] Often at the expense of ourselves
[2013.36 → 2014.54] Or families
[2014.54 → 2016.52] But true joy
[2016.52 → 2017.70] Jesus says
[2017.70 → 2019.60] Can be experienced now
[2019.60 → 2020.66] But it is not a joy
[2020.66 → 2022.04] That comes through the circumstances
[2022.04 → 2023.30] Of this world
[2023.30 → 2024.20] But it is joy
[2024.20 → 2025.16] That we see
[2025.16 → 2025.98] Through focusing
[2025.98 → 2028.06] On his kingdom
[2028.06 → 2029.72] This sign
[2029.72 → 2030.80] That Jesus enacts
[2030.80 → 2031.42] Is taking
[2031.42 → 2032.94] Our misery of sin
[2032.94 → 2034.68] And he turns it
[2034.68 → 2036.78] Into a banqueting joy
[2036.78 → 2037.78] Of the kingdom
[2037.78 → 2038.78] Of God
[2038.78 → 2041.98] Let us move on
[2041.98 → 2043.22] To the second sign
[2043.22 → 2044.26] The healing
[2044.26 → 2046.12] Of the official's son
[2046.12 → 2047.66] In John 4
[2047.66 → 2049.98] This is a sign
[2049.98 → 2051.16] Of faith
[2051.16 → 2053.40] At this point in the gospel
[2053.40 → 2054.38] Jesus has actually been
[2054.38 → 2055.26] Travelling around
[2055.26 → 2055.96] Quite a bit
[2055.96 → 2056.96] He's been doing
[2056.96 → 2057.98] Quite a few miracles
[2057.98 → 2058.76] Of healing
[2058.76 → 2060.64] And casting out demons
[2060.64 → 2061.82] Miracles not recorded
[2061.82 → 2063.04] In John's gospel
[2063.04 → 2064.52] But recorded in the others
[2064.52 → 2065.30] And now he actually
[2065.30 → 2066.52] Comes back to Cana
[2066.52 → 2067.36] The same place
[2067.36 → 2068.22] Where he turned
[2068.22 → 2069.84] The water into wine
[2069.84 → 2070.90] And the people
[2070.90 → 2071.88] Who are following Jesus
[2071.88 → 2073.16] They had seen these miracles
[2073.16 → 2074.04] They had seen these
[2074.04 → 2075.00] Different signs
[2075.00 → 2076.28] But they were not yet
[2076.28 → 2078.74] Believing who Jesus was
[2078.74 → 2081.22] Verse 48 of John 4
[2081.22 → 2081.56] Says
[2081.56 → 2083.22] Jesus says to the people
[2083.22 → 2084.18] Unless you people
[2084.18 → 2085.70] See signs and wonders
[2085.70 → 2087.70] You will not believe
[2087.70 → 2090.16] But then someone comes
[2090.16 → 2092.56] Who saw these past signs
[2092.56 → 2094.02] Someone who is an outsider
[2094.02 → 2095.12] Who is a royal official
[2095.12 → 2096.70] And he comes
[2096.70 → 2098.78] In absolute desperation
[2098.78 → 2100.68] For Jesus to heal
[2100.68 → 2101.58] His son
[2101.58 → 2103.08] This is not a Jewish person
[2103.08 → 2104.24] This was not a follower
[2104.24 → 2104.70] Of Jesus
[2104.70 → 2105.70] But he heard Jesus
[2105.70 → 2107.38] And he comes in total faith
[2107.38 → 2109.24] And Jesus says to this official
[2109.24 → 2111.42] Go your son is healed
[2111.42 → 2113.86] And it says in verse 50
[2113.86 → 2115.32] The man took Jesus
[2115.32 → 2116.16] At his word
[2116.16 → 2117.24] And departed
[2117.24 → 2119.96] See the followers of Jesus
[2119.96 → 2121.00] They wanted proof
[2121.00 → 2121.92] They wanted miracles
[2121.92 → 2123.16] They wanted wonders
[2123.16 → 2124.32] Before they could believe
[2124.32 → 2125.44] They wanted to hold
[2125.44 → 2126.62] All the cards
[2126.62 → 2127.32] And to remain
[2127.32 → 2128.32] In control
[2128.32 → 2129.22] Of what they thought
[2129.22 → 2129.94] And what they knew
[2129.94 → 2130.88] And what they believe
[2130.88 → 2131.56] In a sense
[2131.56 → 2133.30] They were holding Jesus hostage
[2133.30 → 2134.62] That only if Jesus
[2134.62 → 2135.84] Performed these signs
[2135.84 → 2136.94] And these signs worked out
[2136.94 → 2137.78] In their life
[2137.78 → 2138.82] That then they would believe
[2138.82 → 2139.82] That he is God
[2139.82 → 2142.16] And really this is
[2142.16 → 2143.60] Our original sin
[2143.60 → 2144.56] Isn't it
[2144.56 → 2146.34] We are called to faith
[2146.34 → 2148.30] But we want to know it all
[2148.30 → 2150.52] We want to control it all
[2150.52 → 2151.94] We want to say
[2151.94 → 2152.96] I will decide
[2152.96 → 2154.56] If this guy is worth following
[2154.56 → 2156.40] But first he needs to wow me
[2156.40 → 2158.78] First things need to work out
[2158.78 → 2160.96] But this official
[2160.96 → 2162.86] Just comes
[2162.86 → 2165.02] Knowing that he is totally
[2165.02 → 2166.78] Lost without Jesus
[2166.78 → 2168.78] His son is totally lost
[2168.78 → 2169.96] Without Jesus
[2169.96 → 2171.24] And that even though
[2171.24 → 2172.48] He was a man in authority
[2172.48 → 2173.72] Even though he had this illusion
[2173.72 → 2174.88] Of control in his life
[2174.88 → 2175.60] He could tell people
[2175.60 → 2176.88] Go here and go there
[2176.88 → 2177.82] And do his bidding
[2177.82 → 2179.26] He recognized that it was
[2179.26 → 2181.50] Only Jesus the Messiah
[2181.50 → 2183.18] Who was sovereign
[2183.18 → 2185.50] This official is freed
[2185.50 → 2186.42] From the burden
[2186.42 → 2187.90] And the illusion
[2187.90 → 2189.18] Of control
[2189.18 → 2190.94] We often have in life
[2190.94 → 2192.64] And he lays himself
[2192.64 → 2194.80] In the freedom of faith
[2194.80 → 2196.58] Before the only one
[2196.58 → 2198.72] Who is truly sovereign
[2198.72 → 2202.88] The third sign
[2202.88 → 2205.62] The healing of the lame man
[2205.62 → 2207.06] In John 5
[2207.06 → 2208.92] This is a sign
[2208.92 → 2209.96] Of health
[2209.96 → 2211.94] For me
[2211.94 → 2213.26] This is a sign
[2213.26 → 2214.24] At first glance
[2214.24 → 2215.42] That is very close
[2215.42 → 2216.12] To my heart
[2216.12 → 2217.16] It's a sign
[2217.16 → 2218.38] That we all crave
[2218.38 → 2219.04] That sign
[2219.04 → 2220.10] Of health
[2220.10 → 2221.94] But not only
[2221.94 → 2223.18] Is Jesus talking here
[2223.18 → 2224.36] About bodily health
[2224.36 → 2225.62] But he's pointing
[2225.62 → 2227.80] To something much deeper
[2227.80 → 2229.46] He is also talking
[2229.46 → 2230.30] About sin
[2230.30 → 2232.08] And spiritual health
[2232.08 → 2233.48] Jesus comes
[2233.48 → 2235.48] Across this man
[2235.48 → 2236.16] At this pool
[2236.16 → 2236.94] That people think
[2236.94 → 2238.58] Have healing powers
[2238.58 → 2239.62] And he heals them
[2239.62 → 2240.56] And later on
[2240.56 → 2241.44] Jesus and the disciples
[2241.44 → 2242.68] They find this man
[2242.68 → 2243.88] Then in the temple
[2243.88 → 2245.12] And in verse 14
[2245.12 → 2246.72] Jesus says to the man
[2246.72 → 2248.24] See you are well again
[2248.24 → 2249.50] Stop sinning
[2249.50 → 2250.72] Or something worse
[2250.72 → 2251.76] May happen to you
[2251.76 → 2254.38] Unlike other healings
[2254.38 → 2254.96] We read about
[2254.96 → 2256.28] In the other gospels
[2256.28 → 2257.90] Jesus is speaking here
[2257.90 → 2259.74] About a deeper ailment
[2259.74 → 2260.76] In this man
[2260.76 → 2261.76] He moves beyond
[2261.76 → 2262.64] The physical
[2262.64 → 2263.48] And this is what
[2263.48 → 2264.46] Makes it a sign
[2264.46 → 2266.44] Jesus takes the focus
[2266.44 → 2267.88] Off the physical body
[2267.88 → 2269.40] And he begins to draw
[2269.40 → 2270.08] Our attention
[2270.08 → 2272.56] To our spiritual health
[2272.56 → 2274.68] And this is a tough pill
[2274.68 → 2275.92] To sometimes swallow
[2275.92 → 2277.16] But more important
[2277.16 → 2278.02] Than our physical
[2278.02 → 2279.16] And body health
[2279.16 → 2280.08] Jesus says
[2280.08 → 2281.78] Is our spiritual health
[2281.78 → 2282.80] And our need
[2282.80 → 2283.80] For healing
[2283.80 → 2284.80] In Christ
[2284.80 → 2286.42] Of our soul
[2286.42 → 2288.44] But again
[2288.44 → 2289.78] We so often
[2289.78 → 2290.74] Ignore this
[2290.74 → 2292.46] And we chase the sign
[2292.46 → 2293.36] We turn the sign
[2293.36 → 2294.38] On its physical head
[2294.38 → 2295.54] And we do everything
[2295.54 → 2296.48] In our power
[2296.48 → 2298.98] To receive physical healing
[2298.98 → 2300.74] Which is a good thing
[2300.74 → 2301.98] We think if we don't
[2301.98 → 2302.98] Have physical health
[2302.98 → 2303.86] And I've said this before
[2303.86 → 2304.42] For myself
[2304.42 → 2305.08] If we don't have
[2305.08 → 2306.04] Physical health
[2306.04 → 2307.46] Well then we have nothing
[2307.46 → 2310.12] But if we think
[2310.12 → 2310.84] That health
[2310.84 → 2311.78] In this life
[2311.78 → 2312.80] Can only be found
[2312.80 → 2313.98] In our bodies
[2313.98 → 2315.30] Then we are missing
[2315.30 → 2317.84] An incredibly deep truth
[2317.84 → 2320.34] For the reality
[2320.34 → 2321.48] Is we are all born
[2321.48 → 2323.10] Into a broken world
[2323.10 → 2325.08] We will all have troubles
[2325.08 → 2325.88] And from the day
[2325.88 → 2326.64] We are born
[2326.64 → 2328.02] All of our bodies
[2328.02 → 2329.00] Are decaying
[2329.00 → 2330.40] Each and every day
[2330.40 → 2331.94] And Jesus
[2331.94 → 2332.44] Yes
[2332.44 → 2334.00] Can bring healing
[2334.00 → 2335.24] And I have testimony
[2335.24 → 2336.34] That I am a recipient
[2336.34 → 2338.10] Of physical healing
[2338.10 → 2340.34] But the greater miracle
[2340.34 → 2341.90] That Jesus came to give us
[2341.90 → 2342.84] Is not what happens
[2342.84 → 2343.60] In our bodies
[2343.60 → 2344.82] But what happens
[2344.82 → 2346.30] In our spirit
[2346.30 → 2347.36] In our soul
[2347.36 → 2349.06] Verse 24
[2349.06 → 2350.06] Jesus says
[2350.06 → 2351.10] He says
[2351.10 → 2352.40] Very truly I tell you
[2352.40 → 2354.10] Whoever hears my word
[2354.10 → 2355.00] And believes him
[2355.00 → 2355.74] Who sent me
[2355.74 → 2357.06] Has eternal life
[2357.06 → 2358.38] And will not be judged
[2358.38 → 2359.74] But is crossed over
[2359.74 → 2361.66] From death to life
[2361.66 → 2364.34] Our physical bodies
[2364.34 → 2366.46] Will always be decaying
[2366.46 → 2367.90] But true life
[2367.90 → 2368.98] True health
[2368.98 → 2370.32] And full healing
[2370.32 → 2371.68] Can only happen
[2371.68 → 2372.70] On this side of heaven
[2372.70 → 2373.78] In our soul
[2373.78 → 2374.88] Through the work
[2374.88 → 2375.88] Of Christ
[2375.88 → 2379.74] This brings us then
[2379.74 → 2381.16] To the fourth sign
[2381.16 → 2382.76] That Jesus gives us
[2382.76 → 2384.32] A very popular miracle
[2384.32 → 2386.04] The feeding of the 5,000
[2386.04 → 2387.72] In John 6
[2387.72 → 2389.72] This is a very popular miracle
[2389.72 → 2390.30] Or sign
[2390.30 → 2390.74] As I said
[2390.74 → 2391.52] It's the only miracle
[2391.52 → 2392.48] That's recorded
[2392.48 → 2394.34] In all four gospels
[2394.34 → 2395.10] And there's something
[2395.10 → 2396.12] Kind of going on though
[2396.12 → 2396.46] Between
[2396.46 → 2398.16] Before Jesus even performs
[2398.16 → 2399.20] This sign
[2399.20 → 2400.06] In verse 2
[2400.06 → 2400.78] It says
[2400.78 → 2402.00] And a great crowd of people
[2402.00 → 2402.98] Followed Jesus
[2402.98 → 2404.72] Because they saw the signs
[2404.72 → 2405.56] He had performed
[2405.56 → 2407.32] By healing the sick
[2407.32 → 2408.92] Once again
[2408.92 → 2409.96] The people were following
[2409.96 → 2410.86] Not because
[2410.86 → 2412.86] Of who Jesus was
[2412.86 → 2414.14] But because
[2414.14 → 2415.60] They saw these signs
[2415.60 → 2416.30] These works
[2416.30 → 2417.40] These miracles
[2417.40 → 2418.74] And once again
[2418.74 → 2419.80] As we all kind of do
[2419.80 → 2421.22] They turned those signs
[2421.22 → 2422.36] Upside down
[2422.36 → 2423.72] They chased the physical
[2423.72 → 2426.86] But not the spiritual reality
[2426.86 → 2428.42] Behind the sign
[2428.42 → 2430.04] That people were wanting
[2430.04 → 2431.12] Something from Jesus
[2431.12 → 2432.44] They wanted to use Jesus
[2432.44 → 2433.44] As an instrument
[2433.44 → 2435.44] For their own physical pleasure
[2435.44 → 2437.40] Now Jesus
[2437.40 → 2438.66] Of course being Jesus
[2438.66 → 2439.92] Has compassion
[2439.92 → 2441.18] On these people
[2441.18 → 2442.14] Even though the motive
[2442.14 → 2443.40] Was all wrong
[2443.40 → 2444.54] And what he does
[2444.54 → 2445.14] And as we know
[2445.14 → 2446.06] He takes two fish
[2446.06 → 2447.32] Five loaves
[2447.32 → 2448.08] He blesses them
[2448.08 → 2448.90] Gives thanks for them
[2448.90 → 2449.64] He breaks them
[2449.64 → 2450.86] And he feeds
[2450.86 → 2452.84] All 5,000 people
[2452.84 → 2454.06] And it says
[2454.06 → 2454.62] That the people
[2454.62 → 2455.46] Ate as much
[2455.46 → 2456.28] As they wanted
[2456.28 → 2457.00] And the disciples
[2457.00 → 2459.64] Gathered 12 basketfuls
[2459.64 → 2460.72] That were left over
[2460.72 → 2462.40] Jesus gives them
[2462.40 → 2464.40] This lavish supply
[2464.40 → 2466.48] But then something else
[2466.48 → 2467.96] Happens in verse 14
[2467.96 → 2468.90] It says
[2468.90 → 2469.74] Jesus knowing
[2469.74 → 2471.00] That this crowd
[2471.00 → 2472.16] Intended to come
[2472.16 → 2473.20] And make him king
[2473.20 → 2473.98] By force
[2473.98 → 2475.30] Withdrew again
[2475.30 → 2476.10] To a mountain
[2476.10 → 2477.48] By himself
[2477.48 → 2479.60] Jesus withdraws
[2479.60 → 2480.28] From the crowd
[2480.28 → 2481.04] For Jesus knew
[2481.04 → 2481.70] That his kingdom
[2481.70 → 2482.50] Would not come
[2482.50 → 2483.16] By force
[2483.16 → 2484.14] Or by warfare
[2484.14 → 2485.20] But his kingdom
[2485.20 → 2486.24] Would only come
[2486.24 → 2486.88] Through his
[2486.88 → 2487.42] Presence
[2487.42 → 2488.72] And by dying
[2488.72 → 2489.56] And rising
[2489.56 → 2490.20] Again
[2490.20 → 2491.88] Again the people
[2491.88 → 2492.92] Switched the sign
[2492.92 → 2494.02] They traded the reality
[2494.02 → 2494.80] For the sign
[2494.80 → 2496.08] They wanted physical food
[2496.08 → 2496.86] And riches
[2496.86 → 2497.88] And materials
[2497.88 → 2499.20] As we often do today
[2499.20 → 2500.94] We chase the materialism
[2500.94 → 2502.20] Of this world
[2502.20 → 2503.30] But the sign
[2503.30 → 2505.18] Is that Jesus
[2505.18 → 2507.00] Is not our bread winner
[2507.00 → 2508.98] But he is
[2508.98 → 2510.84] The bread of heaven
[2510.84 → 2512.78] A little later on
[2512.78 → 2513.42] In this chapter
[2513.42 → 2515.50] In verses 33 and 34
[2515.50 → 2516.60] It says
[2516.60 → 2518.44] For the bread of God
[2518.44 → 2520.76] Is the bread
[2520.76 → 2521.52] That has come down
[2521.52 → 2522.12] From heaven
[2522.12 → 2523.36] And gives life
[2523.36 → 2524.08] To the world
[2524.08 → 2525.48] I am the bread
[2525.48 → 2525.94] Of life
[2525.94 → 2526.72] Jesus said
[2526.72 → 2528.08] Whoever comes to me
[2528.08 → 2529.00] Will never go hungry
[2529.00 → 2530.50] And whoever believes
[2530.50 → 2531.04] In me
[2531.04 → 2532.92] Will never be thirsty
[2532.92 → 2535.98] Now Jesus does
[2535.98 → 2537.86] Provide for our
[2537.86 → 2539.04] Physical needs
[2539.04 → 2540.46] But in doing that
[2540.46 → 2541.54] He also commissions
[2541.54 → 2543.00] Each one
[2543.00 → 2543.36] Of us
[2543.36 → 2544.60] To help provide
[2544.60 → 2545.66] For the needs
[2545.66 → 2546.42] Of the world
[2546.42 → 2547.30] For those who have
[2547.30 → 2547.64] Lots
[2547.64 → 2549.86] To give to those
[2549.86 → 2551.38] Who are in need
[2551.38 → 2553.74] But Jesus did not
[2553.74 → 2555.34] Come to be the king
[2555.34 → 2556.92] Of our physical needs
[2556.92 → 2558.38] To physically feed us
[2558.38 → 2559.42] Or to make us rich
[2559.42 → 2560.00] Or to give us
[2560.00 → 2561.20] All the material blessings
[2561.20 → 2562.28] That we want
[2562.28 → 2563.16] But he came
[2563.16 → 2564.62] As the bread
[2564.62 → 2565.54] Of life
[2565.54 → 2567.44] And it is only Jesus
[2567.44 → 2568.60] Who can offer us
[2568.60 → 2569.60] True bread
[2569.60 → 2570.58] That can truly
[2570.58 → 2571.56] Fill us
[2571.56 → 2573.40] Which is of course
[2573.40 → 2574.54] His own
[2574.54 → 2575.34] Body
[2575.34 → 2577.38] You know it's quite often
[2577.38 → 2578.64] I find it very interesting
[2578.64 → 2579.84] That often those
[2579.84 → 2581.16] In our world
[2581.16 → 2581.94] Who experience
[2581.94 → 2582.44] The greatest
[2582.44 → 2583.62] Physical needs
[2583.62 → 2585.22] Are often the people
[2585.22 → 2586.38] Who are most full
[2586.38 → 2587.02] Of joy
[2587.02 → 2588.58] And the spirit
[2588.58 → 2590.06] And it's quite often
[2590.06 → 2590.50] Us
[2590.50 → 2591.68] Who have everything
[2591.68 → 2593.06] Where our appetites
[2593.06 → 2594.22] Are really insatiable
[2594.22 → 2595.62] Where we have full stomachs
[2595.62 → 2597.00] And full wallets
[2597.00 → 2597.92] But we are starving
[2597.92 → 2599.12] In spirit
[2599.12 → 2600.12] We are starving
[2600.12 → 2601.46] For the true bread
[2601.46 → 2603.02] That can fill
[2603.02 → 2605.86] But Jesus says to us
[2605.86 → 2607.60] Only in finding
[2607.60 → 2608.64] Your true
[2608.64 → 2609.58] And spiritual
[2609.58 → 2610.84] Provision in me
[2610.84 → 2612.18] The bread of life
[2612.18 → 2613.96] Will you ever be full
[2613.96 → 2615.06] And satisfied
[2615.06 → 2616.50] In this life
[2616.50 → 2620.48] This brings us then
[2620.48 → 2621.82] To the fifth sign
[2621.82 → 2623.20] We're over halfway there
[2623.20 → 2627.20] Jesus walking on water
[2627.20 → 2628.66] In John 6
[2628.66 → 2630.14] It is a sign
[2630.14 → 2631.78] Of his presence
[2631.78 → 2632.72] Among us
[2632.72 → 2634.72] See right on the heels
[2634.72 → 2635.24] Of the feeding
[2635.24 → 2636.26] Of the 5,000
[2636.26 → 2637.72] Jesus goes away
[2637.72 → 2639.18] It says to this mountaintop
[2639.18 → 2640.40] And he goes to pray
[2640.40 → 2641.42] While he does that
[2641.42 → 2642.28] The disciples
[2642.28 → 2643.38] Get in a boat
[2643.38 → 2644.24] And they begin
[2644.24 → 2646.04] Rowing across the sea
[2646.04 → 2647.42] And then it says
[2647.42 → 2648.40] In verse 17
[2648.40 → 2649.12] It says
[2649.12 → 2650.24] By now it was dark
[2650.24 → 2651.16] And Jesus
[2651.16 → 2651.98] Had not yet
[2651.98 → 2652.98] Joined them
[2652.98 → 2654.64] Now this phrase
[2654.64 → 2655.28] Is of course
[2655.28 → 2656.36] Physically true
[2656.36 → 2657.74] But this phrase
[2657.74 → 2658.54] Is also
[2658.54 → 2659.40] A symbol
[2659.40 → 2660.82] You see quite often
[2660.82 → 2661.36] In the Bible
[2661.36 → 2661.90] And I think
[2661.90 → 2662.42] We probably
[2662.42 → 2663.30] Experience it
[2663.30 → 2664.06] Also within
[2664.06 → 2664.86] Our own life
[2664.86 → 2666.32] Physical darkness
[2666.32 → 2667.56] Or the feeling
[2667.56 → 2668.58] Of darkness
[2668.58 → 2669.80] Is often
[2669.80 → 2670.96] Powerfully linked
[2670.96 → 2672.30] With the absence
[2672.30 → 2673.32] Of Jesus
[2673.32 → 2675.60] Now it was dark
[2675.60 → 2676.06] And Jesus
[2676.06 → 2676.80] Had not yet
[2676.80 → 2677.54] Joined them
[2677.54 → 2678.64] The disciples
[2678.64 → 2679.36] Were afraid
[2679.36 → 2680.40] Because Jesus
[2680.40 → 2681.78] Was not with them
[2681.78 → 2683.08] But as we know
[2683.08 → 2683.72] And as the miracle
[2683.72 → 2684.28] Tells us
[2684.28 → 2685.84] Jesus walks on the water
[2685.84 → 2686.76] He approaches the boat
[2686.76 → 2687.64] He gets in the boat
[2687.64 → 2688.14] And he says
[2688.14 → 2688.94] To his disciples
[2688.94 → 2690.20] It is I
[2690.20 → 2691.80] Do not be afraid
[2691.80 → 2693.74] Jesus comes
[2693.74 → 2695.42] And all is made
[2695.42 → 2696.20] Calm
[2696.20 → 2697.60] For you see
[2697.60 → 2698.84] Jesus is the only one
[2698.84 → 2699.58] Who can truly
[2699.58 → 2701.50] Make us feel safe
[2701.50 → 2702.82] And know that we are safe
[2702.82 → 2703.78] When we are secure
[2703.78 → 2704.76] In him
[2704.76 → 2706.30] But again
[2706.30 → 2707.00] So often
[2707.00 → 2708.10] We trade the meaning
[2708.10 → 2709.40] For the sign
[2709.40 → 2710.70] And we just want the sign
[2710.70 → 2711.42] And we set up
[2711.42 → 2712.16] Kind of very
[2712.16 → 2713.88] So many different senses
[2713.88 → 2715.20] A false sense of security
[2715.20 → 2716.10] Wherever we go
[2716.10 → 2717.40] Within this world
[2717.40 → 2718.24] We have our phones
[2718.24 → 2718.90] Always with us
[2718.90 → 2719.60] We have alarms
[2719.60 → 2720.22] On our cars
[2720.22 → 2720.82] And in our house
[2720.82 → 2721.50] We have dogs
[2721.50 → 2723.08] Maybe we even have guns
[2723.08 → 2724.46] To make us safe
[2724.46 → 2725.68] All these different things
[2725.68 → 2727.00] To try to make us safe
[2727.00 → 2728.88] But I can tell you
[2728.88 → 2730.32] Seven weeks ago
[2730.32 → 2731.12] When I had the major
[2731.12 → 2732.16] Blockage in my bowel
[2732.16 → 2733.50] My phone was right beside me
[2733.50 → 2734.06] On one side
[2734.06 → 2734.70] And my wife Carrie
[2734.70 → 2735.56] Was on the other side
[2735.56 → 2736.44] And there was nothing
[2736.44 → 2737.02] They could do
[2737.02 → 2738.42] To alleviate the pain
[2738.42 → 2740.04] Or what I was going through
[2740.04 → 2743.12] The truth is
[2743.12 → 2744.54] That security and safety
[2744.54 → 2745.60] Though important
[2745.60 → 2746.62] And responsible
[2746.62 → 2748.66] Are also an illusion
[2748.66 → 2750.06] Within this world
[2750.06 → 2751.88] And it is only Jesus
[2751.88 → 2753.18] Who can provide
[2753.18 → 2754.24] Our true security
[2754.24 → 2755.22] It is only Jesus
[2755.22 → 2756.48] Who can calm
[2756.48 → 2757.40] Our fear
[2757.40 → 2760.04] He said
[2760.04 → 2761.04] The meaning and reality
[2761.04 → 2762.20] Of this sign
[2762.20 → 2762.82] Again
[2762.82 → 2764.44] Is not that Jesus
[2764.44 → 2766.14] Calms every storm
[2766.14 → 2767.84] I think we wish
[2767.84 → 2768.64] It were so
[2768.64 → 2769.68] And we often chase
[2769.68 → 2770.44] The calming
[2770.44 → 2771.28] Of every storm
[2771.28 → 2772.02] In our life
[2772.02 → 2773.48] But the reality
[2773.48 → 2774.24] Is sometimes
[2774.24 → 2774.92] The boat
[2774.92 → 2775.72] In the storms
[2775.72 → 2776.16] Of life
[2776.16 → 2777.60] Is overturned
[2777.60 → 2778.26] And sometimes
[2778.26 → 2778.68] The boat
[2778.68 → 2779.50] Even goes down
[2779.50 → 2780.32] In the waves
[2780.32 → 2782.60] But Jesus says
[2782.60 → 2784.06] I am with you
[2784.06 → 2785.40] Through my spirit
[2785.40 → 2786.60] I am with you
[2786.60 → 2787.70] In the storm
[2787.70 → 2789.32] I will never leave you
[2789.32 → 2790.54] Nor forsake you
[2790.54 → 2791.64] For when you trust
[2791.64 → 2792.16] In me
[2792.16 → 2793.20] And who I am
[2793.20 → 2794.16] As the son of God
[2794.16 → 2795.36] You are secure
[2795.36 → 2797.18] In my everlasting arms
[2797.18 → 2798.50] You are secure
[2798.50 → 2799.78] In my love
[2799.78 → 2800.86] And grace
[2800.86 → 2806.66] Our second last sign
[2806.66 → 2807.76] Number six
[2807.76 → 2809.36] Jesus heals
[2809.36 → 2810.76] The man born blind
[2810.76 → 2811.80] In John nine
[2811.80 → 2813.34] And it is a sign
[2813.34 → 2814.72] Of salvation
[2814.72 → 2816.96] Jesus and his disciples
[2816.96 → 2818.28] Are travelling along
[2818.28 → 2819.08] And they happen
[2819.08 → 2820.52] Across this man
[2820.52 → 2821.72] Who was born blind
[2821.72 → 2822.80] And the disciples
[2822.80 → 2823.46] Asked Jesus
[2823.46 → 2824.06] Who sinned
[2824.06 → 2824.58] This man
[2824.58 → 2825.68] Or his parents
[2825.68 → 2826.40] The disciples
[2826.40 → 2827.32] Needed to know
[2827.32 → 2828.04] What was happening
[2828.04 → 2828.62] The disciples
[2828.62 → 2829.80] Needed to justify
[2829.80 → 2830.76] What had happened
[2830.76 → 2831.58] To this man
[2831.58 → 2833.12] But Jesus says
[2833.12 → 2833.46] To them
[2833.46 → 2834.14] In verses three
[2834.14 → 2834.62] And five
[2834.62 → 2835.42] Of chapter nine
[2835.42 → 2837.06] But this has happened
[2837.06 → 2837.96] So that the works
[2837.96 → 2838.42] Of God
[2838.42 → 2839.28] Might be displayed
[2839.28 → 2839.88] In him
[2839.88 → 2841.04] As long as
[2841.04 → 2842.92] It is day
[2842.92 → 2844.98] We must do
[2844.98 → 2845.56] The works
[2845.56 → 2845.92] Of him
[2845.92 → 2846.62] Who sent me
[2846.62 → 2847.54] But night
[2847.54 → 2848.12] Is coming
[2848.12 → 2849.00] When no one
[2849.00 → 2849.56] Can work
[2849.56 → 2850.32] While I am
[2850.32 → 2850.96] In the world
[2850.96 → 2852.18] I am
[2852.18 → 2852.96] The light
[2852.96 → 2854.14] Of the world
[2854.14 → 2856.22] At this point
[2856.22 → 2856.96] Jesus is getting
[2856.96 → 2858.08] Closer and closer
[2858.08 → 2859.84] To his crucifixion
[2859.84 → 2860.96] And the signs
[2860.96 → 2861.96] Of who he is
[2861.96 → 2862.62] And what life
[2862.62 → 2863.30] In his name
[2863.30 → 2863.56] Mean
[2863.56 → 2865.04] Are intensifying
[2865.04 → 2866.00] And this
[2866.00 → 2866.60] Signs
[2866.60 → 2867.60] This sign
[2867.60 → 2868.20] Shows
[2868.20 → 2869.32] What happens
[2869.32 → 2870.12] When Jesus
[2870.12 → 2870.90] Is fully
[2870.90 → 2871.84] Revealed
[2871.84 → 2872.94] As the Messiah
[2872.94 → 2873.76] The son
[2873.76 → 2874.56] Of God
[2874.56 → 2875.84] Of what happens
[2875.84 → 2876.88] When his love
[2876.88 → 2878.24] And his grace
[2878.24 → 2879.68] Shine into the
[2879.68 → 2880.06] Darkness
[2880.06 → 2881.14] Of our own
[2881.14 → 2881.94] Hearts
[2881.94 → 2882.96] For you see
[2882.96 → 2883.54] In the face
[2883.54 → 2884.14] Of Jesus
[2884.14 → 2885.42] All of our
[2885.42 → 2885.88] Deeds
[2885.88 → 2886.70] Are laid
[2886.70 → 2887.26] Bare
[2887.26 → 2888.52] Like the
[2888.52 → 2888.98] Disciples
[2888.98 → 2889.22] Though
[2889.22 → 2889.78] So often
[2889.78 → 2890.18] We try
[2890.18 → 2890.90] To justify
[2890.90 → 2891.96] Ourselves
[2891.96 → 2892.32] When that
[2892.32 → 2892.60] Light
[2892.60 → 2893.10] Of Jesus
[2893.10 → 2894.04] Shines
[2894.04 → 2894.60] On us
[2894.60 → 2895.04] When light
[2895.04 → 2895.32] Kind of
[2895.32 → 2895.70] All of a sudden
[2895.70 → 2896.14] Comes
[2896.14 → 2896.96] Into our
[2896.96 → 2897.46] Eyes
[2897.46 → 2898.02] Often times
[2898.02 → 2898.34] We make
[2898.34 → 2899.18] Excuses
[2899.18 → 2899.56] For our
[2899.56 → 2900.00] Actions
[2900.00 → 2900.24] Or we
[2900.24 → 2900.52] Want to
[2900.52 → 2900.86] Blame
[2900.86 → 2901.44] Other people
[2901.44 → 2901.78] Or we
[2901.78 → 2902.62] Want to
[2902.62 → 2902.92] Blame
[2902.92 → 2903.88] Circumstances
[2903.88 → 2904.46] We make
[2904.46 → 2904.98] Ourselves
[2904.98 → 2905.30] To be
[2905.30 → 2905.74] The victim
[2905.74 → 2906.12] To try
[2906.12 → 2906.58] To shift
[2906.58 → 2907.04] The blame
[2907.04 → 2907.82] Anywhere
[2907.82 → 2908.46] But on
[2908.46 → 2909.16] Our own
[2909.16 → 2909.88] Heart
[2909.88 → 2912.18] But the
[2912.18 → 2912.60] Interesting
[2912.60 → 2913.52] Thing here
[2913.52 → 2914.28] With this
[2914.28 → 2914.76] Miracle
[2914.76 → 2915.60] With this
[2915.60 → 2916.06] Sign
[2916.06 → 2916.88] Is that
[2916.88 → 2917.44] Jesus and
[2917.44 → 2917.94] The disciples
[2917.94 → 2918.96] Happen across
[2918.96 → 2919.64] This blind
[2919.64 → 2919.92] Man
[2919.92 → 2921.00] Jesus sees
[2921.00 → 2921.58] This blind
[2921.58 → 2921.96] Man who
[2921.96 → 2922.26] Is this
[2922.26 → 2922.70] Darkness
[2922.70 → 2923.76] Of physical
[2923.76 → 2924.50] Vision
[2924.50 → 2925.76] And Jesus
[2925.76 → 2926.84] Fully takes
[2926.84 → 2927.54] The initiative
[2927.54 → 2929.04] This man
[2929.04 → 2929.66] If you read
[2929.66 → 2930.38] Through the
[2930.38 → 2930.76] Miracle
[2930.76 → 2931.24] Through the
[2931.24 → 2931.52] Sign
[2931.52 → 2932.40] Actually plays
[2932.40 → 2933.84] No part
[2933.84 → 2934.84] In this
[2934.84 → 2935.36] Story
[2935.36 → 2935.74] He is
[2935.74 → 2936.30] Completely
[2936.30 → 2937.46] Passive
[2937.46 → 2938.28] Until
[2938.28 → 2938.82] Jesus
[2938.82 → 2939.52] Heals
[2939.52 → 2939.74] Him
[2939.74 → 2940.68] And then
[2940.68 → 2940.92] Jesus
[2940.92 → 2941.40] Tells him
[2941.40 → 2941.76] To go
[2941.76 → 2942.32] And wash
[2942.32 → 2942.62] And the
[2942.62 → 2943.24] Man goes
[2943.24 → 2944.44] And obeys
[2944.44 → 2946.12] The initiative
[2946.12 → 2947.04] Is entirely
[2947.04 → 2948.66] With Jesus
[2948.66 → 2950.04] This man
[2950.04 → 2950.64] Knows his
[2950.64 → 2950.88] Need
[2950.88 → 2951.40] He knows
[2951.40 → 2951.74] He is
[2951.74 → 2952.16] Physically
[2952.16 → 2952.66] Blind
[2952.66 → 2953.40] And Jesus
[2953.40 → 2954.04] Comes to
[2954.04 → 2954.30] Him
[2954.30 → 2954.88] And tells
[2954.88 → 2955.10] Him
[2955.10 → 2956.16] Receive
[2956.16 → 2956.92] Sight
[2956.92 → 2957.78] Receive
[2957.78 → 2958.56] Light
[2958.56 → 2959.08] In your
[2959.08 → 2959.56] Eyes
[2959.56 → 2961.30] See
[2961.30 → 2961.62] Jesus
[2961.62 → 2962.26] Has come
[2962.26 → 2962.94] Into the
[2962.94 → 2963.28] World
[2963.28 → 2964.14] To turn
[2964.14 → 2964.98] The lights
[2964.98 → 2965.52] On
[2965.52 → 2966.20] And in
[2966.20 → 2966.56] The light
[2966.56 → 2966.82] Of his
[2966.82 → 2967.26] Love
[2967.26 → 2968.00] We have
[2968.00 → 2968.38] To ask
[2968.38 → 2968.92] Ourselves
[2968.92 → 2969.50] Can we
[2969.50 → 2970.00] Acknowledge
[2970.00 → 2970.30] Though
[2970.30 → 2970.98] Our
[2970.98 → 2971.28] Own
[2971.28 → 2971.58] Need
[2971.58 → 2972.26] Our
[2972.26 → 2972.50] Own
[2972.50 → 2972.96] Darkness
[2972.96 → 2973.74] Our
[2973.74 → 2974.08] Own
[2974.08 → 2974.94] Blindness
[2974.94 → 2975.88] Can we
[2975.88 → 2976.66] Acknowledge
[2976.66 → 2977.18] This in
[2977.18 → 2977.80] Humility
[2977.80 → 2978.88] And receive
[2978.88 → 2979.84] Without trying
[2979.84 → 2980.52] To justify
[2980.52 → 2981.44] Ourselves
[2981.44 → 2982.24] His
[2982.24 → 2983.20] Initiative
[2983.20 → 2984.46] Of salvation
[2984.46 → 2985.48] To each
[2985.48 → 2986.14] And every
[2986.14 → 2986.76] One of
[2986.76 → 2987.02] Us
[2987.02 → 2989.02] God
[2989.02 → 2990.40] And this
[2990.40 → 2990.42] And this
[2990.42 → 2990.44] And this
[2990.44 → 2990.46] And this
[2990.46 → 2990.50] And this
[2990.50 → 2990.84] And brings
[2990.84 → 2991.62] Us to
[2991.62 → 2992.08] The final
[2992.08 → 2992.96] Sign in
[2992.96 → 2993.40] The gospel
[2993.40 → 2993.90] Of John
[2993.90 → 2995.20] The raising
[2995.20 → 2996.44] Of Lazarus
[2996.44 → 2997.82] John 11
[2997.82 → 2998.98] Which is a
[2998.98 → 3000.04] Sign of
[3000.04 → 3000.50] Eternal
[3000.50 → 3001.78] Or long
[3001.78 → 3002.48] Life
[3002.48 → 3003.78] It is a
[3003.78 → 3004.52] Final sign
[3004.52 → 3005.22] That Jesus
[3005.22 → 3006.06] Performs
[3006.06 → 3006.64] Before he
[3006.64 → 3007.60] Gathers his
[3007.60 → 3008.32] Disciples in
[3008.32 → 3008.70] The upper
[3008.70 → 3009.04] Room
[3009.04 → 3009.46] And he
[3009.46 → 3009.98] Goes to
[3009.98 → 3010.48] His death
[3010.48 → 3011.46] And eventual
[3011.46 → 3012.32] Resurrection
[3012.32 → 3013.20] Is the
[3013.20 → 3013.80] Final sign
[3013.80 → 3014.30] That Jesus
[3014.30 → 3014.98] Performs
[3014.98 → 3015.38] To show
[3015.38 → 3015.58] Us
[3015.58 → 3016.30] Who he
[3016.30 → 3016.68] Is
[3016.68 → 3017.02] And what
[3017.02 → 3017.42] Life
[3017.42 → 3017.82] On this
[3017.82 → 3018.10] World
[3018.10 → 3018.78] Looks like
[3018.78 → 3020.00] In him
[3020.00 → 3020.84] And there's
[3020.84 → 3021.10] A lot
[3021.10 → 3021.68] Going on
[3021.68 → 3022.34] In John
[3022.34 → 3022.68] 11
[3022.68 → 3022.98] It's a
[3022.98 → 3023.66] Very long
[3023.66 → 3024.04] Chapter
[3024.04 → 3024.42] There's a
[3024.42 → 3024.66] Lot of
[3024.66 → 3025.30] Very in
[3025.30 → 3025.64] Depth
[3025.64 → 3026.30] Teaching
[3026.30 → 3026.74] In it
[3026.74 → 3027.10] But this
[3027.10 → 3027.34] Morning
[3027.34 → 3027.54] We're
[3027.54 → 3027.86] Just going
[3027.86 → 3028.42] To focus
[3028.42 → 3029.16] On the
[3029.16 → 3029.44] Actual
[3029.44 → 3029.88] Moment
[3029.88 → 3030.30] Of the
[3030.30 → 3030.68] Miracle
[3030.68 → 3030.88] The
[3030.88 → 3031.22] Moment
[3031.22 → 3031.92] Of the
[3031.92 → 3032.26] Sign
[3032.26 → 3032.46] In
[3032.46 → 3032.74] Verses
[3032.74 → 3033.38] 34
[3033.38 → 3034.70] And
[3034.70 → 3035.36] 44
[3035.36 → 3036.62] 43
[3036.62 → 3037.00] And
[3037.00 → 3037.50] 44

[3512.66 → 3517.08] Fullness of God in endless pain
[3517.08 → 3521.40] This gift of love and righteousness
[3521.40 → 3526.72] Scorned by the ones we came to save
[3526.72 → 3531.68] Till on that cross has Jesus died
[3531.68 → 3536.32] The wealth of God was satisfied
[3536.32 → 3541.50] For every sin upon Him was made
[3541.50 → 3546.40] Here in the death of Christ I live
[3546.40 → 3560.06] No guilt in life, no fear in death
[3560.06 → 3564.44] They sent the power of Christ in me
[3564.44 → 3569.28] From last, first, right to final breath
[3569.28 → 3572.96] Jesus commands my destiny
[3572.96 → 3578.20] No power of God, no skin of man
[3578.20 → 3582.84] Can live above me from this hand
[3582.84 → 3587.64] Till He returns, will cause me home
[3587.64 → 3592.28] Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
[3592.28 → 3614.32] Our offering this morning

[3767.40 → 3768.40] Amen.
[3768.40 → 3769.40] Amen.
[3769.40 → 3774.40] I would like to lead you in our community prayer.
[3774.40 → 3777.40] Let us pray.
[3777.40 → 3786.40] We praise you, O God, for your word, the Bible, written that we may believe that Jesus is
[3786.40 → 3793.40] the Messiah, your son, and that by believing we may have life in his name.
[3793.40 → 3797.40] Your word shows us road signs of your kingdom.
[3797.40 → 3806.40] We praise you for all these signs pointing us to Jesus and life in his name.
[3806.40 → 3810.40] Father in heaven, we know that you care for each of us deeply.
[3810.40 → 3815.40] Today, we bring before you the needs of our own congregation here in Ladder.
[3815.40 → 3820.40] We pray for your healing present, that your healing presence may be known by Michael Wayne
[3820.40 → 3824.40] DeVos as his cancer struggle continues.
[3824.40 → 3827.40] Grant him healing, Lord.
[3827.40 → 3835.40] We pray for those in our congregation experiencing limits due to age or infirmity, namely Pat Barman,
[3835.40 → 3842.40] Shirley Mass, Eileen Hideout, Hank and Liz Van Beech, Tank Ninja.
[3842.40 → 3848.40] Today, we remember Wilma Van Tal as she is experiencing ongoing pain.
[3848.40 → 3850.40] May a diagnosis be found.
[3850.40 → 3854.40] Bless her as she adjusts to life at Augustin House.
[3854.40 → 3856.40] A big change for her.
[3856.40 → 3864.40] Lord, it is difficult to watch or read the news of our world.
[3864.40 → 3869.40] We are a world that is in desperate need for you, God.
[3869.40 → 3872.40] We pause today to think of the war in Ukraine.
[3872.40 → 3878.40] This ongoing international armed conflict has resulted in a massive displacement of people,
[3878.40 → 3884.40] widespread destruction and significant casualties.
[3884.40 → 3887.40] Lord, have mercy.
[3887.40 → 3893.40] We bring the civil war in Sudan to you, which has led to a massive humanitarian crisis
[3893.40 → 3900.40] with millions displaced and facing starvation and alarming rates of sexual violence.
[3900.40 → 3903.40] Lord, have mercy.
[3903.40 → 3910.40] Father God, Myanmar is experiencing a complex civil war involving numerous armed groups,
[3910.40 → 3915.40] resulting in a high number of casualties and displacement.
[3915.40 → 3918.40] Lord, have mercy.
[3918.40 → 3923.40] And in Yemen, the ongoing civil war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis
[3923.40 → 3928.40] with widespread hunger and displacement.
[3928.40 → 3931.40] Lord, have mercy.
[3931.40 → 3936.40] Father, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, particularly the recent escalation,
[3936.40 → 3943.40] has resulted in a high number of casualties and a severe humanitarian crisis.
[3943.40 → 3946.40] Lord, have mercy.
[3946.40 → 3950.40] We are a world that is desperate for you, God.
[3950.40 → 3956.40] When powers struggle for dominance and war, oppression and abuse result.
[3956.40 → 3962.40] When groups of people oppose one another because of ideology, religion, or culture,
[3962.40 → 3967.40] we need a God who is bigger than ourselves, bigger than anyone.
[3967.40 → 3973.40] When people are disregarded and devalued because of poverty, geography, or disease.
[3973.40 → 3979.40] When compassion and justice is withheld to some because of race or gender.
[3979.40 → 3983.40] We need a saviour who is more compassionate than we are.
[3983.40 → 3988.40] Who includes even those that are excluded.
[3988.40 → 3994.40] When resources are mismanaged and abused and the world and its creatures are destroyed.
[3994.40 → 4002.40] When motivation is scarce and creativity is in short supply to address the challenges that your world faces.
[4002.40 → 4008.40] We need a spirit that is more powerful and more creative than we could ever be.
[4008.40 → 4014.40] Lord God, loving saviour, empowering spirit.
[4014.40 → 4020.40] We offer you these prayers because your world needs you so desperately.
[4020.40 → 4024.40] Captivate us, call us, and fill us.
[4024.40 → 4032.40] That we may be carriers of your eternal life to this world that you love so dearly.
[4032.40 → 4034.40] Amen.
[4038.40 → 4052.40] Well, it has been wonderful to be with you these past two weeks.
[4052.40 → 4056.40] You have an excellent preacher in Jason, but I also hope he'll invite me back sometime.
[4056.40 → 4057.40] Because I've very much enjoyed this.
[4057.40 → 4060.40] Please stand to receive God's parting blessing.
[4060.40 → 4061.40] Amen.
[4061.40 → 4070.40] Brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ, as we go out this week, let us go out under the blessing of the Lord.
[4070.40 → 4081.40] May the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, may the love of God, and may the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be and abide with each one of you.
[4081.40 → 4083.40] Let us all say, Amen.
[4083.40 → 4084.40] Amen.
[4084.40 → 4085.40] Lord of Lords, King of Kings, you alone are worthy.
[4085.40 → 4086.40] All the earth and heaven sing, praises to the Lord.
[4087.40 → 4092.40] Amen.
[4092.40 → 4101.98] Lord of lords, King of kings,
[4101.98 → 4106.66] You alone are worthy.
[4107.52 → 4112.14] All the earth and heaven sing
[4112.14 → 4116.86] praises to Your name.
[4116.86 → 4122.30] Man of God, Holy One,
[4122.76 → 4126.58] righteous and forgiving,
[4127.78 → 4132.38] On each star, rising sun,
[4132.78 → 4136.20] there is none like You.
[4137.68 → 4142.26] Praise the Father, praise the Son,
[4142.26 → 4146.60] Praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4147.46 → 4151.54] Praise the King of glory.
[4152.28 → 4156.24] Praise Him for eternity.
