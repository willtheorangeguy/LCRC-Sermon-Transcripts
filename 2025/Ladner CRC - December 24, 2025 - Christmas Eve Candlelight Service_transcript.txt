[361.46 --> 363.46]  Good evening, everyone.
[363.46 --> 365.46]  And Merry Christmas.
[365.46 --> 370.46]  I warmly welcome you to our Christmas Eve service.
[370.46 --> 377.34]  And if we haven't had a chance to meet, my name is Jason, and I am so grateful to serve
[377.34 --> 378.46]  as a pastor here.
[378.46 --> 383.46]  On behalf of our church family, if you are visiting this evening, thank you.
[383.46 --> 384.46]  Thank you for joining us.
[384.46 --> 387.46]  We are honored by your presence.
[387.46 --> 394.46]  And also, the title of our Christmas Eve service tonight is What Are You Waiting For?
[394.46 --> 400.66]  It is written by Marian Vandriel, who is also at the piano tonight, and directed by Christina
[400.66 --> 401.66]  Banchot.
[401.66 --> 404.66]  And they have done a tremendous job of putting this together.
[404.66 --> 414.46]  And so, may this be an evening of deep and rich adoration and connection with our Lord
[414.46 --> 415.46]  Jesus.
[415.46 --> 422.46]  And so, dear ones, on this Christmas Eve, let it be our great joy to hear again the message
[422.46 --> 430.66]  from God's Word, which takes us back in our hearts and our minds to Bethlehem and to our
[430.66 --> 432.46]  Savior's birth.
[432.46 --> 440.46]  So, this evening, may our hearts be warmed, may our hopes soar as we hear the Christmas
[440.46 --> 441.46]  story once again.
[441.46 --> 447.66]  And let us make this place glad with our singing and our carols.
[447.66 --> 452.66]  But first, let us pray together.
[452.66 --> 460.66]  Heavenly Father, because of your amazing love, you sent your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to
[460.66 --> 464.66]  come to earth and to become one of us.
[464.66 --> 471.66]  Lord, you came to rescue us from sin and death and to bring us salvation.
[471.66 --> 480.66]  O Lord, your love is so high and wide and deep that it and only it could reach this suffering
[480.66 --> 481.66]  world.
[481.66 --> 488.66]  You came to bring an end to our sadness, to dry our tears and to still our fears, to give
[488.66 --> 489.66]  us hope.
[489.66 --> 494.66]  And you have not left us without a reason to rejoice.
[494.66 --> 497.66]  And so, in deep gratitude, we praise you this evening.
[497.66 --> 501.66]  We worship you for coming to us and dwelling among us.
[501.66 --> 507.66]  Lord, we pray that our hearts would be stirred tonight to know you, to worship you, and to
[507.66 --> 509.66]  see our Lord Jesus Christ.
[509.66 --> 516.66]  And we pray in the name of him who is called Emmanuel, God with us.
[516.66 --> 517.66]  Amen.
[517.66 --> 518.66]  Amen.
[518.66 --> 523.66]  And so, please stand.
[523.66 --> 528.66]  And we will sing our first song together, O Come All Ye Faithful.
[528.66 --> 529.66]  Amen.
[529.66 --> 530.66]  Amen.
[530.66 --> 531.66]  Amen.
[531.66 --> 532.66]  Amen.
[532.66 --> 533.66]  Amen.
[533.66 --> 534.66]  Amen.

[602.66 --> 604.66]  Amen.
[632.66 --> 634.66]  Amen.
[662.66 --> 664.66]  Amen.
[664.66 --> 686.66]  You may be seated.
[692.66 --> 696.66]  Waiting is hard.
[696.66 --> 700.66]  We all wait for something at one time or another.
[700.66 --> 706.66]  Maybe the kids here tonight have had a hard time waiting for Christmas.
[706.66 --> 710.66]  Maybe some young people have been waiting to meet a true friend.
[710.66 --> 716.66]  Some students may be waiting to discover their future profession or work.
[716.66 --> 722.66]  Some adults may be waiting to find a better job or a better place to live.
[722.66 --> 728.66]  Some older person may be waiting to hear from the doctor about their medical tests.
[728.66 --> 732.66]  Some may be waiting for a relationship to heal.
[732.66 --> 740.66]  Almost since the beginning of time, waiting has been a big part of humanity's experience.
[740.66 --> 742.66]  And it's often hard to wait.
[742.66 --> 746.66]  Maybe you're waiting for something too.
[746.66 --> 750.66]  And wondering if and when it will happen.
[750.66 --> 755.66]  Well, tonight we'll hear stories of people who waited.
[755.66 --> 758.66]  God gave them promises.
[758.66 --> 765.66]  But while they were waiting, they wondered whether those promises would ever come to pass.
[765.66 --> 786.66]  God made all the earth, all living creatures, all people, and God declared all of it good.
[786.66 --> 790.66]  But the people did not always follow God's ways.
[790.66 --> 794.66]  They hurt one another and the living things on earth.
[794.66 --> 798.66]  So God sent wise men and women called prophets.
[798.66 --> 802.66]  Their job was to remind people to live in God's image.
[802.66 --> 808.66]  But still, the people ignored the prophets and great pain and suffering followed.
[808.66 --> 810.66]  But God had another plan in mind.
[810.66 --> 814.66]  And a great prophet named Isaiah first spoke of it.
[814.66 --> 828.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[828.66 --> 830.66]  The wolf shall live with the lamb.
[830.66 --> 832.66]  The leopard shall lie down with the goat.
[832.66 --> 834.66]  The calf and the lion together.
[834.66 --> 836.66]  And a little child shall lead them.
[836.66 --> 838.66]  They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain.
[838.66 --> 856.66]  For the earth will be full of the knowledge of God as the waters cover the sea.
[856.66 --> 858.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[858.66 --> 860.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[860.66 --> 862.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[862.66 --> 864.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[864.66 --> 866.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[866.66 --> 868.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[868.66 --> 870.66]  the Lord shall live with the Lamb.
[870.66 --> 874.66]  The Lord shall live with the lamb.
[874.66 --> 875.66]  Amen.
[904.66 --> 905.66]  Amen.
[934.66 --> 943.20]  Many years later, the people were still waiting with hope for the one promised by God through Isaiah's words.
[944.22 --> 948.76]  The whole earth was holding its breath, waiting for what was to come.
[949.90 --> 956.48]  Everyone had the feeling it would be something wonderful, something different from anything God had done before.
[956.48 --> 965.28]  God was watching a woman named Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah, who were both faithful and loving.
[966.36 --> 969.12]  They were sad because they had no children.
[970.36 --> 975.98]  They had waited for years for a child, but it seemed Elizabeth could not get pregnant.
[977.22 --> 985.30]  One day, when both of them had grown old, Zechariah was praying at the temple when an angel came to him.
[986.48 --> 1014.14]  Zechariah said to the angel,
[1014.14 --> 1023.62]  Then the angel said,
[1023.62 --> 1048.98]  Zechariah just couldn't believe it.
[1048.98 --> 1052.58]  He and Elizabeth were already old enough to be grandparents.
[1053.82 --> 1059.08]  The angel admonished Zechariah for questioning the message that God himself had sent.
[1059.96 --> 1065.90]  Because he questioned God's plan, Zechariah would not be able to speak until his son was born.
[1066.96 --> 1071.68]  And now, Zechariah had to wait to tell everyone about his encounter with the angel.
[1071.68 --> 1080.60]  As he waited for his speech to return, Zechariah had a long time to think about how he would describe his visit with the angel.
[1081.26 --> 1088.14]  As he waited, he wondered, too, how his son would help the world get ready for the coming of their Savior.
[1088.14 --> 1092.68]  Hajariah

[1099.86 --> 1101.86]  Amen.
[1129.86 --> 1131.86]  Amen.
[1159.86 --> 1161.86]  Amen.
[1189.86 --> 1191.86]  Amen.
[1219.86 --> 1221.86]  Amen.
[1249.86 --> 1251.86]  Amen.
[1279.86 --> 1281.86]  Amen.
[1309.86 --> 1311.86]  Amen.
[1339.86 --> 1341.86]  Amen.
[1369.86 --> 1371.86]  Amen.
[1399.86 --> 1401.86]  Amen.
[1429.86 --> 1431.86]  Amen.
[1459.86 --> 1461.86]  Amen.
[1461.86 --> 1462.86]  Amen.
[1462.86 --> 1463.86]  Amen.
[1463.86 --> 1465.86]  Amen.
[1465.86 --> 1467.86]  Amen.
[1467.86 --> 1469.86]  Amen.
[1469.86 --> 1471.86]  Amen.
[1484.86 --> 1487.86]  Elizabeth did indeed become pregnant, although it was not a child.
[1487.86 --> 1491.86]  She'd become pregnant, although she was quite old.
[1491.86 --> 1495.86]  God, who always keeps his promises, came through for her.
[1495.86 --> 1497.86]  Elizabeth was so excited.
[1497.86 --> 1506.86]  She kept her pregnancy a secret, so not even her relatives, like her niece, Mary of Nazareth, knew about it.
[1507.86 --> 1512.86]  Mary was a young woman engaged to marry a man named Joseph.
[1512.86 --> 1524.86]  One day, as Mary sat in her room praying, a bright light shone around her, and the angel Gabriel appeared to her with a powerful message.
[1524.86 --> 1530.86]  Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[1530.86 --> 1538.86]  And now you will become pregnant, and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.
[1538.86 --> 1543.86]  He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[1543.86 --> 1545.86]  Mary said to the angel,
[1545.86 --> 1549.86]  How can this be, since I am a virgin?
[1549.86 --> 1551.86]  The angel said to her,
[1551.86 --> 1558.86]  The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of God will overshadow you.
[1558.86 --> 1564.86]  Therefore, the child to be born will be called Holy.
[1564.86 --> 1570.86]  And now your Aunt Elizabeth, in her old age, is also pregnant with a son.
[1570.86 --> 1573.86]  For nothing will be impossible with God.
[1573.86 --> 1575.86]  Then Mary said,
[1575.86 --> 1581.86]  Here I am, the servant of the Lord.
[1581.86 --> 1585.86]  Let it be with me, as you have said.
[1585.86 --> 1595.86]  The Holy Spirit will come upon you, as you have said.
[1595.86 --> 1597.86]  Amen.
[1625.86 --> 1627.86]  Amen.
[1655.86 --> 1657.86]  Amen.
[1679.86 --> 1681.86]  Mary was amazed and confused,
[1681.86 --> 1686.72]  and confused and a little bit frightened by what the angel had told her.
[1687.74 --> 1689.72]  She decided to go see Elizabeth,
[1690.52 --> 1695.02]  since she and her husband, Zechariah, had also been visited by an angel.
[1696.36 --> 1700.78]  Maybe visiting Elizabeth would help Mary understand what had happened.
[1701.70 --> 1704.38]  When she arrived at Elizabeth's home,
[1704.90 --> 1706.82]  Elizabeth ran out to meet her,
[1707.06 --> 1710.34]  shouting that the baby inside her jumped for joy
[1710.34 --> 1712.10]  as Mary came near.
[1713.12 --> 1716.14]  In that moment, God showed Elizabeth
[1716.14 --> 1721.20]  that Mary's baby would be the Savior of the world.
[1722.46 --> 1726.68]  Elizabeth was thrilled that the mother of her Lord had come.
[1727.04 --> 1731.96]  And Mary, she was so excited about all this news
[1731.96 --> 1734.86]  that she sang a song to God,
[1735.00 --> 1738.40]  giving thanks for everything that was about to happen.
[1738.40 --> 1744.48]  For she knew these babies were the fulfillment of God's promise
[1744.48 --> 1746.50]  to rescue his people.
[1746.50 --> 1750.62]  My soul magnifies the Lord,
[1751.30 --> 1754.92]  and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior.
[1755.92 --> 1759.12]  For you have looked with favor on your lowly servant.
[1760.36 --> 1764.26]  Surely from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
[1764.26 --> 1768.08]  For the mighty one has done great things for me,
[1768.28 --> 1770.40]  and holy is God's name.
[1771.44 --> 1775.26]  Your mercy, O God, is for those who fear you,
[1775.68 --> 1778.04]  from generation to generation.
[1778.60 --> 1781.44]  You have shown strength and power,
[1782.10 --> 1784.96]  and scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
[1785.64 --> 1788.74]  You have brought down the powerful from their thrones,
[1788.74 --> 1790.90]  and lifted up the lowly.
[1791.72 --> 1794.48]  You have filled the hungry with good things,
[1795.02 --> 1797.08]  and sent the rich away empty.
[1798.02 --> 1800.06]  You have helped your people Israel
[1800.06 --> 1802.14]  in remembrance of your mercy,
[1802.74 --> 1806.20]  according to the promises you made to our ancestors.
[1806.20 --> 1807.46]  Let's sing along with your absolutely yet to our ancestors.
[1809.92 --> 1826.60]  sharp
[1826.60 --> 1827.76]  but
[1827.76 --> 1829.98]  you have influenced Taran Taboo involves an emotion
[1829.98 --> 1831.18]  of what type of focusing by the

[1864.48 --> 1865.48]  Amen.
[1894.48 --> 1895.48]  Amen.
[1924.48 --> 1925.48]  Amen.
[1925.48 --> 1926.48]  Amen.
[1926.48 --> 1927.48]  Amen.
[1927.48 --> 1928.48]  Amen.
[1928.48 --> 1929.48]  Amen.
[1929.48 --> 1930.48]  Amen.
[1930.48 --> 1931.48]  Amen.
[1931.48 --> 1932.48]  Amen.
[1932.48 --> 1933.48]  Amen.
[1933.48 --> 1934.48]  Amen.
[1934.48 --> 1935.48]  Amen.
[1935.48 --> 1936.48]  Amen.
[1936.48 --> 1938.48]  And now they waited.
[1938.48 --> 1943.48]  Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months and then went home.
[1943.48 --> 1951.48]  After she left, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, John, who would grow up to be John the Baptist,
[1951.48 --> 1955.48]  the one who would tell his people that Jesus was coming.
[1955.48 --> 1958.48]  John would also baptize Jesus.
[1958.48 --> 1962.48]  When John was born, Zechariah's time of waiting was over.
[1962.48 --> 1964.48]  He could finally speak again.
[1964.48 --> 1970.48]  He said that God had told him not only who John would become, but something about the
[1970.48 --> 1973.48]  coming of Jesus as well.
[1974.48 --> 1980.48]  Blessed be the God of Israel, who has looked with favor on the people and redeemed them.
[1980.48 --> 1987.48]  God has raised up for us a mighty Savior in the house of King David.
[1987.48 --> 1993.48]  And you, my child, will be called the prophet of the Most High.
[1993.48 --> 1998.48]  For you will go before the Savior to prepare his way, to give knowledge of salvation to the
[1998.48 --> 2001.48]  people by the forgiveness of their sins.
[2001.48 --> 2007.48]  By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us, to give light
[2007.48 --> 2014.48]  to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace.
[2014.48 --> 2018.48]  God is a glorified Savior to make unto our celebration of peace.
[2018.48 --> 2019.48]  This has been my serpents.
[2019.48 --> 2021.48]  SometimesRA Jesus is the son of God that is also yah, no peaceful, and to
[2021.48 --> 2022.48]  purpose.
[2022.48 --> 2024.48]  D soutarly the word giants andwormegara.
[2024.48 --> 2026.48]  Amen.
[2054.48 --> 2056.48]  Amen.
[2084.48 --> 2086.48]  Amen.
[2114.48 --> 2116.48]  Amen.
[2144.48 --> 2150.48]  Amen.
[2162.04 --> 2164.22]  Amen.
[2164.22 --> 2166.22]  Amen.
[2166.22 --> 2170.92]  Just when the time came that Mary was expecting her baby to be born,
[2170.92 --> 2176.46]  something happened that made life much more difficult for her and for Joseph.
[2177.34 --> 2183.10]  They had to travel more than a day's journey on foot from their home in Nazareth
[2183.10 --> 2187.70]  to get to the town of Bethlehem, which was Joseph's hometown.
[2188.86 --> 2195.14]  The emperor in Rome decided to take account of all the people who lived in the Roman Empire.
[2195.76 --> 2200.80]  So Mary and Joseph had to return to Joseph's hometown to be counted.
[2201.90 --> 2209.74]  In those days, a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered.
[2210.86 --> 2213.54]  All went to their own towns to be registered.
[2214.56 --> 2222.32]  Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to the city of David called Bethlehem
[2222.32 --> 2226.54]  because he was descended from the family of King David.
[2226.54 --> 2232.94]  He went with Mary, to whom he was engaged, and who was expecting a child.
[2233.74 --> 2238.00]  And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.
[2238.86 --> 2241.16]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2241.16 --> 2246.20]  She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger
[2246.20 --> 2250.14]  because there was no lodging available for them.
[2250.14 --> 2255.34]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2255.34 --> 2259.24]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2259.24 --> 2268.34]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2268.34 --> 2270.44]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2270.44 --> 2272.28]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2272.28 --> 2274.30]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.
[2274.30 --> 2277.54]  She gave birth to her firstborn son.

[2433.50 --> 2435.50]  I love you.
[2435.50 --> 2437.50]  I love you.
[2437.50 --> 2439.50]  I love you.
[2439.50 --> 2441.50]  I love you.
[2441.50 --> 2445.50]  Sing, sing for the King of Kings.
[2445.50 --> 2451.24]  Sing, sing for the Prince of Peace.
[2451.24 --> 2456.44]  Joy to the world, a Savior is born.
[2456.44 --> 2461.24]  Come and rejoice in Christ our Lord.
[2461.24 --> 2465.24]  Sing, sing for the King.
[2465.24 --> 2471.24]  Sing, sing for the King.
[2471.24 --> 2475.24]  Sing, sing for the King.
[2475.24 --> 2477.24]  Sing, sing for the King.
[2477.24 --> 2479.24]  In theacy of the Him.
[2479.24 --> 2487.56]  As a Doerah O' At that time, an astonishing thing happened in the sky.
[2487.56 --> 2500.66]  At that time, an astonishing thing happened in the skies.
[2501.38 --> 2502.40]  A star appeared.
[2503.14 --> 2506.14]  It was much brighter than all the other stars in the sky.
[2507.26 --> 2511.64]  The shepherds, in some fields just outside a small town called Bethlehem,
[2512.08 --> 2514.16]  noticed it while they were watching their sheep.
[2514.16 --> 2517.72]  They were waiting for their long night to be over,
[2518.50 --> 2523.62]  another night of making sure their sheep wouldn't wander off or be eaten by a wild animal.
[2524.80 --> 2527.06]  These shepherds weren't waiting for the star.
[2527.68 --> 2529.36]  It was a wonderful surprise.
[2530.24 --> 2534.60]  So was the angel who gave them the news that a new king was born.
[2539.12 --> 2543.88]  That night, there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.
[2545.08 --> 2547.80]  Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them,
[2548.28 --> 2550.96]  and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them.
[2552.04 --> 2553.18]  They were terrified.
[2554.18 --> 2556.48]  But the angel reassured them.
[2557.34 --> 2558.74]  Don't be afraid, he said.
[2559.10 --> 2562.64]  I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all the people.
[2562.64 --> 2571.18]  The Savior, yes, the Messiah, the Lord, has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David.
[2572.10 --> 2574.38]  And you will recognize him by this sign.
[2575.20 --> 2580.16]  You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.
[2580.16 --> 2589.70]  Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others, the armies of heaven, praising God and saying,
[2590.48 --> 2595.52]  Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.
[2595.52 --> 2610.52]  Lium and Pieve to Son.
[2610.52 --> 2611.52]  Amen.
[2640.52 --> 2641.52]  Amen.
[2670.52 --> 2671.52]  Amen.
[2678.12 --> 2683.90]  Well, the shepherds were overcome with excitement about their visit from the angels.
[2684.50 --> 2687.78]  They couldn't wait to see what the angels had told them.
[2688.50 --> 2694.96]  And even more, they couldn't wait to tell everyone the wonderful news about the birth of Jesus,
[2694.96 --> 2702.02]  whom God had promised so long ago, the one who would come to save the world.
[2724.96 --> 2726.02]  Amen.
[2726.02 --> 2727.02]  Thank you.
[2727.84 --> 2728.24]  Amen.

[2779.92 --> 2781.92]  Amen.
[2809.92 --> 2811.92]  Amen.
[2825.52 --> 2831.68]  The shepherds said to each other,
[2832.10 --> 2833.76]  Let's go to Bethlehem.
[2834.22 --> 2836.56]  Let's see this thing that has happened,
[2836.88 --> 2838.64]  which the Lord has told us about.
[2838.64 --> 2843.00]  They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph,
[2843.86 --> 2847.28]  and there was the baby lying in the manger.
[2848.92 --> 2852.90]  After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened
[2852.90 --> 2855.72]  and what the angel had said to them about this child.
[2856.60 --> 2859.70]  All who heard the shepherds' story were astonished,
[2860.28 --> 2865.24]  but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.
[2865.24 --> 2872.82]  The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen.
[2873.32 --> 2876.14]  It was just as the angel had told them.
[2876.14 --> 2878.26]  Omaha.
[2880.36 --> 2885.38]  There was a blessing in her heart and thought,
[2885.54 --> 2886.20]  which can be brought to you together,
[2886.42 --> 2889.32]  as we princes for it are not for me.

[3191.32 --> 3193.32]  Amen.
[3193.32 --> 3195.32]  Amen.
[3195.32 --> 3201.32]  Some magi, astronomers who studied the stars, noticed this star in the sky, many miles from
[3201.32 --> 3202.32]  Bethlehem.
[3202.32 --> 3206.32]  They decided to take a trip to see what it meant.
[3206.32 --> 3212.32]  Some time after Jesus was born, they traveled to Bethlehem to worship Jesus, bringing gifts
[3212.32 --> 3216.32]  for this great king of all kings.
[3216.32 --> 3221.32]  And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem.
[3221.32 --> 3226.32]  It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.
[3226.32 --> 3229.32]  When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
[3229.32 --> 3235.32]  They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped
[3235.32 --> 3236.32]  him.
[3236.32 --> 3243.32]  Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

[3383.28 --> 3385.28]  Amen.
[3385.28 --> 3387.28]  Amen.
[3387.28 --> 3393.18]  We have heard the incredible story of Christmas again tonight.
[3393.18 --> 3399.30]  God has kept his promise to send us a Savior who is Jesus Christ.
[3400.14 --> 3404.10]  He takes away our darkness, replacing it with his light.
[3404.74 --> 3408.32]  And no matter what we are waiting for, he is with us.
[3408.32 --> 3413.94]  Jesus, God's son, became human and experienced sorrow, rejection, and pain.
[3414.54 --> 3417.76]  He knew what it was to live without basic needs.
[3418.58 --> 3419.60]  He was often homeless.
[3420.60 --> 3425.20]  But he waited for the day when God's promise to make everything right would come.
[3425.94 --> 3434.08]  And that day came on Easter when Jesus, who had died for the sins of the world, was raised to new life.
[3434.88 --> 3436.86]  We, too, wait for many things.
[3436.86 --> 3446.56]  Maybe the very thing we're waiting for, the thing we don't even realize we're waiting for, is to be raised with Jesus to new life.
[3447.24 --> 3457.36]  This happens when we, along with the shepherds, the magi, and countless people throughout the ages, kneel in worship of the Savior.
[3458.22 --> 3459.44]  He is waiting for you.
[3460.40 --> 3462.56]  What are you waiting for?
[3462.56 --> 3462.68]  Amen.
[3466.86 --> 3468.68]  Amen.

[3628.56 --> 3630.84]  oiled in a star.

[3636.48 --> 3637.96]  bowed.
