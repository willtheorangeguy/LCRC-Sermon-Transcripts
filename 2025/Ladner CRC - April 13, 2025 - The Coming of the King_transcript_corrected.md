[328.00 → 329.14] Good morning.
[329.14 → 329.64] Good morning.
[329.64 → 330.64] Good morning.
[330.64 → 333.08] Good morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[333.40 → 335.18] Welcome to our worship this morning.
[335.30 → 339.86] It's a joy to worship with you here at Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[340.66 → 342.12] Special welcome to you.
[342.28 → 345.66] If you are a guest today or visiting with us for the first time,
[346.00 → 348.88] we are very glad that you are here with us today.
[350.00 → 353.80] Today is a special day in the church calendar.
[353.98 → 354.98] It is Palm Sunday,
[354.98 → 365.58] which is the day when we remember the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem with shouts of Hosanna.
[365.58 → 369.84] And Hosanna means save us.
[369.84 → 376.36] Save us, oh Lord, as the people look for the coming of the Saviour.
[376.36 → 380.66] And they acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah.
[380.66 → 385.66] And Holy Week is today.
[385.66 → 387.78] It begins today on this Sunday of Palm Sunday.
[387.78 → 393.14] And Holy Week is the last seven days of Jesus' earthly life and ministry.
[393.14 → 399.02] It leads from the proclamations of Hosanna as Jesus comes into Jerusalem.
[399.02 → 406.44] But it then leads to the cross on Good Friday and the resurrection on Easter Sunday,
[406.44 → 407.90] which we will celebrate next week.
[407.90 → 413.00] And so, just a few announcements.
[414.06 → 422.20] Is that, okay, so Good Friday, on Friday, we do have a Good Friday worship service right here at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[422.50 → 423.14] It's a day off.
[423.74 → 433.90] So, 10 o'clock, we'll come and worship the Lord on this quite sombre occasion as we remember Christ's death on the cross.
[433.90 → 438.26] And then, of course, next Sunday, we will have our Easter worship service.
[438.40 → 443.52] And there are some invitation cards on the table for you to give to friends and invite them.
[443.82 → 447.00] Easter, I know you know this, but I'll just remind you again,
[447.16 → 453.84] it is a great time to invite anybody and everybody you see on the street to come to church.
[455.74 → 459.44] Our cross-training class on Christian worldview is ongoing.
[459.96 → 462.62] You are welcome to drop in any time and learn something new.
[462.62 → 472.46] Also, today, right after, not right after, but this afternoon at 2 o'clock, there is singing at the Mountain View Manor.
[472.82 → 478.04] So, everyone is welcome to come and sing with us as we seek to bless the residents of Mountain View Manor.
[479.88 → 482.22] And I think that's it for our announcements.
[482.22 → 495.06] So, people of God, we are here today because we have been called by the King of Kings to worship him.
[496.14 → 503.64] And we claim Jesus' promise as we gather that where two or three are gathered in his name, he promises to be among us.
[504.40 → 505.40] We've reached the quota.
[505.64 → 507.18] Two or three, we're good.
[507.18 → 512.24] So, would you join me in this call to worship from Psalm 118?
[512.56 → 513.78] We'll say this responsibly.
[513.98 → 514.44] I'll begin.
[514.44 → 519.54] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[520.14 → 522.74] From the house of the Lord, we bless you.
[523.96 → 529.36] The Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us.
[530.08 → 535.70] With bows and hand, join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.
[535.70 → 540.44] You are my God, and I will praise you.
[541.00 → 544.58] You are my God, and I will exalt you.
[545.38 → 547.54] Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.
[548.26 → 550.56] His love endures forever.
[550.98 → 553.12] Let's join together in a prayer of adoration.
[553.56 → 554.24] Please pray with me.
[554.24 → 560.64] Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord.
[562.02 → 564.46] No deeds can compare with yours.
[564.92 → 568.94] All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.
[569.78 → 574.34] They will bring glory to your name, for you are great and do marvellous deeds.
[575.26 → 577.46] You alone are God.
[577.46 → 587.30] Lord, as we come this morning into your house of worship, we remember that you once entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday.
[588.30 → 592.06] In the same way, Lord, today would you enter our hearts anew.
[593.48 → 602.50] And Lord, as you set your face towards death on the cross, help us, Lord, to carry our crosses and follow after you.
[602.50 → 611.90] As the children cried, Hosanna, would you enable us to praise you this morning as our Saviour and our King.
[612.40 → 618.44] We adore you, O Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, because your steadfast love endures forever.
[619.10 → 619.46] Amen.
[620.60 → 621.46] Let's stand.
[622.20 → 627.52] God greets us this morning with these words from our Lord Jesus Christ.
[627.80 → 628.78] Jesus says this.
[629.62 → 630.90] Come, where is it?
[632.50 → 633.62] Oh, I didn't put it on the screen.
[634.18 → 634.62] Listen up.
[634.96 → 635.88] Come to me.
[636.74 → 642.20] Jesus says, come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[642.96 → 651.00] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[652.22 → 655.68] As God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet those around us.
[655.68 → 685.66] Thank you.
[685.68 → 688.04] Thank you.
[688.08 → 688.34] Satan?
[688.80 → 689.08] Satan!

[696.06 → 696.66] Bye!
[700.14 → 701.18] Bye!
[705.82 → 709.76] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[709.76 → 714.22] Let us rejoice and be glad in it
[714.22 → 717.28] And let us sing to him
[717.28 → 719.54] Keeping in mind that this is Palm Sunday
[719.54 → 722.44] The day when the streets of Jerusalem are lined
[722.44 → 724.52] And everyone sang
[724.52 → 727.38] So we expect to hear you this morning
[727.38 → 728.96] More than usual

[911.22 → 920.36] Lord Jesus, who I blessed them, don't move into His praise.

[1068.84 → 1070.84] How is everybody doing?
[1070.84 → 1071.84] Good.
[1071.84 → 1074.84] So did you all hear that today is a special day?
[1074.84 → 1076.84] It is a special day.
[1076.84 → 1077.84] Do you know what today is called?
[1077.84 → 1078.84] Anybody?
[1078.84 → 1079.84] Palm Sunday.
[1079.84 → 1080.84] Palm Sunday.
[1080.84 → 1081.84] That's good.
[1081.84 → 1082.84] Today is Palm Sunday.
[1082.84 → 1083.84] Yeah?
[1083.84 → 1084.84] It's Sunday.
[1084.84 → 1085.84] It's Sunday.
[1085.84 → 1086.84] Yeah.
[1086.84 → 1087.84] Yeah.
[1087.84 → 1093.84] So did you in your Sunday school class last week talk about Palm Sunday?
[1093.84 → 1094.84] With the branches?
[1094.84 → 1096.84] Do you all make a craft that was branches?
[1096.84 → 1097.84] I wasn't here.
[1097.84 → 1098.84] You weren't here.
[1098.84 → 1099.84] Yeah, some of you did.
[1099.84 → 1100.84] Well, okay.
[1100.84 → 1102.84] So I want to tell you a story.
[1102.84 → 1104.84] This is the story of Palm Sunday.
[1104.84 → 1110.84] Once, Jesus rode into the city of Jerusalem.
[1110.84 → 1113.84] He was outside the city, and he came into the city.
[1113.84 → 1115.84] Did he walk?
[1115.84 → 1116.84] He didn't walk.
[1116.84 → 1117.84] He rode something.
[1117.84 → 1118.84] What did he ride?
[1118.84 → 1120.84] A donkey.
[1120.84 → 1123.84] Now, Jesus came as a king.
[1123.84 → 1127.84] What kind of animal do you think a king should ride?
[1127.84 → 1129.84] A horse, right?
[1129.84 → 1131.84] A big, beautiful, strong horse.
[1131.84 → 1133.84] But instead, what did Jesus do?
[1133.84 → 1134.84] A donkey.
[1134.84 → 1135.84] He rode on a donkey.
[1135.84 → 1138.84] Now, this is what I want you to think about.
[1138.84 → 1141.84] I want you to imagine that you are the donkey.
[1141.84 → 1142.84] Okay?
[1142.84 → 1144.84] Imagine that you're the donkey.
[1144.84 → 1146.84] Here's a question.
[1146.84 → 1148.84] Do you like it when people say nice things about you?
[1148.84 → 1150.84] And they say, oh, you did a good job.
[1150.84 → 1151.84] Or they praise you in some way.
[1151.84 → 1152.84] Right?
[1152.84 → 1153.84] We all like that.
[1153.84 → 1155.84] Now, imagine the donkey.
[1155.84 → 1160.84] Imagine he is in his stable where horses or donkeys live.
[1160.84 → 1165.84] And some people come, and they say, we have an important job for you.
[1165.84 → 1168.84] You are going to carry Jesus.
[1168.84 → 1172.84] And so the donkey thought, wow, I'm pretty special.
[1172.84 → 1173.84] I get to.
[1173.84 → 1175.84] Jesus, the king, is going to ride on me.
[1175.84 → 1180.84] And so they put some nice purple cloths over your back.
[1180.84 → 1181.84] You're the donkey.
[1181.84 → 1185.84] And Jesus gets on, and you start walking toward the city.
[1185.84 → 1189.84] And there are people all lined up on both sides of the road like a parade.
[1189.84 → 1191.84] And you're the star of the parade.
[1191.84 → 1196.84] And people are shouting and singing and waving these palm branches.
[1196.84 → 1198.84] Would you feel pretty special?
[1198.84 → 1199.84] Yeah.
[1199.84 → 1204.84] You might start to wonder, wow, everyone's cheering for me.
[1204.84 → 1207.84] This is pretty cool.
[1207.84 → 1211.84] Now, who was all that cheering really for?
[1211.84 → 1213.84] Was it for the donkey or for Jesus?
[1213.84 → 1215.84] It was all for Jesus, right?
[1215.84 → 1216.84] Is that what you were going to say?
[1216.84 → 1217.84] Yeah?
[1217.84 → 1218.84] It was all for Jesus.
[1218.84 → 1222.84] Now, what if the donkey thought it was all for him or her?
[1222.84 → 1225.84] What would you, what would, that would be kind of silly, right?
[1225.84 → 1227.84] Because it wasn't really about the donkey.
[1227.84 → 1232.84] It's still pretty cool that he got to be the one to ride in, but, to carry Jesus.
[1232.84 → 1236.84] But really, the praises of the people were for Jesus, not for the donkey.
[1236.84 → 1240.84] Now, here's the lesson I think we can learn.
[1240.84 → 1246.84] That God can use us for his praise and glory.
[1246.84 → 1252.84] But when God uses us, and maybe people say good things, they say, oh, you did such a good job or something.
[1252.84 → 1255.84] What we can do is say it's not about us, it's about God.
[1255.84 → 1261.84] And what God gives us the privilege of doing is we get to carry Jesus wherever we go.
[1261.84 → 1265.84] So what I want you to think about is that you are like a donkey.
[1265.84 → 1275.84] And that Jesus is like riding you, and wherever you go, at home or in school or wherever you go, you're carrying Jesus.
[1275.84 → 1276.84] Okay?
[1276.84 → 1281.84] And that God will use you so that people will see him and praise him.
[1281.84 → 1282.84] Okay?
[1282.84 → 1284.84] Does that sound good?
[1284.84 → 1285.84] Yeah?
[1285.84 → 1286.84] Okay.
[1286.84 → 1287.84] Awesome.
[1287.84 → 1293.84] Now, what we're going to do is we're going to sing another song about, with these words, Hosanna.
[1293.84 → 1294.84] Can everyone say Hosanna?
[1294.84 → 1295.84] Hosanna.
[1295.84 → 1296.84] That's what the people were shouting.
[1296.84 → 1297.84] Hosanna.
[1297.84 → 1298.84] Say it again.
[1298.84 → 1299.84] Hosanna.
[1299.84 → 1300.84] Okay.
[1300.84 → 1302.84] And the people were holding palm branches.
[1302.84 → 1307.84] So what we're going to do is we're going to sing, and we're going to march around the church,
[1307.84 → 1311.84] and we're going to have palm branches, and as we're going to sing, and we're going to shout Hosanna.
[1311.84 → 1312.84] Hosanna.
[1312.84 → 1313.84] Hosanna.
[1313.84 → 1314.84] Okay?
[1314.84 → 1315.84] Let's try it.
[1315.84 → 1316.84] Ryan's going to help us out.
[1316.84 → 1317.84] Okay.
[1317.84 → 1334.84] If you're on the outside aisle, you may want to move in.
[1334.84 → 1351.84] So let's all stand, and we'll sing as well.
[1351.84 → 1355.84] Hosanna in the highest
[1355.84 → 1360.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1360.84 → 1365.84] Hosanna in the highest
[1365.84 → 1370.84] Lord, we lift your name
[1370.84 → 1375.84] With hearts full of praise
[1375.84 → 1379.84] Be exalted on all our shoulders
[1379.84 → 1383.84] Hosanna in the highest
[1383.84 → 1389.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1389.84 → 1399.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1399.84 → 1404.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1404.84 → 1408.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1408.84 → 1412.84] God, we lift our hearts
[1412.84 → 1416.84] We lift your love
[1416.84 → 1418.84] God, we lift your heart
[1418.84 → 1420.84] We lift our hearts
[1420.84 → 1426.84] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1426.84 → 1428.84] Hosanna in the highest
[1428.84 → 1438.84] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the time.
[1438.84 → 1441.84] Hosanna, Hosanna in the time.
[1441.84 → 1445.84] Come and let you love me,
[1445.84 → 1450.84] Sing your choice and praise.
[1450.84 → 1454.84] Be exalted on your Lord, O Massa,
[1454.84 → 1459.84] In the love of my eyes.
[1459.84 → 1464.84] You lift your name,
[1464.84 → 1468.84] To the Lord, to the praise.
[1468.84 → 1472.84] Be exalted on your Lord, O Massa,
[1472.84 → 1478.84] Hosanna in the time.
[1480.84 → 1492.84] You may be seated.
[1492.84 → 1502.84] All right, great job, kids.
[1502.84 → 1506.84] Yeah, I'll come back in and go back to your seats.
[1506.84 → 1508.84] Everyone else can be seated.
[1508.84 → 1516.84] And so, having lifted the Lord with our praises of Hosanna,
[1516.84 → 1520.84] We now enter into a time of confession.
[1520.84 → 1528.84] And what we do in confession is we seek to be honest before God about our struggles with sin, with temptation,
[1528.84 → 1532.84] And to honestly admit our need for grace.
[1532.84 → 1536.84] That we come before the Lord needy.
[1536.84 → 1540.84] That we are needy for his mercy in our lives.
[1540.84 → 1546.84] So, would you join your hearts with mine, as I lead us, in a prayer of confession.
[1546.84 → 1552.84] Let's quiet our hearts and come before the Lord in a prayer of confession.
[1552.84 → 1562.84] O King of glory, we confess that our praise of your majesty has often been faint.
[1562.84 → 1568.84] Our living as citizens of your kingdom has sometimes been treasonous.
[1568.84 → 1574.84] For we have surrendered to the enemy by our secret and our known sins.
[1574.84 → 1578.84] But for our treason you died, Lord Jesus.
[1578.84 → 1582.84] For our restoration you rose again.
[1582.84 → 1586.84] So, Lord, would you draw us closer to you this holy week.
[1586.84 → 1590.84] That our eyes may catch the vision of your sacrifice for us.
[1590.84 → 1595.84] And that our hearts might be filled with the wonder of your grace.
[1595.84 → 1605.84] Lord, by the Holy Spirit's continual discipline in our lives, Lord, would you help us to be loyal and loving servants of the King.
[1605.84 → 1609.84] Praise be to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1609.84 → 1617.84] So now, hear these words of assurance that God gives us in Zechariah 9, verse 16.
[1618.84 → 1619.84] It says,
[1619.84 → 1634.84] Now, I think that's a wonderful verse.
[1634.84 → 1641.84] It says that when God saves his people, it's going to be like you sparkle like jewels in a crown.
[1641.84 → 1643.84] Imagine that.
[1643.84 → 1649.84] The world will look at you and see indescribable beauty.
[1649.84 → 1650.84] Right?
[1650.84 → 1655.84] Because what they will see is the beauty of Jesus Christ formed in you.
[1655.84 → 1660.84] So, God is producing in us purity where there is ugliness.
[1660.84 → 1663.84] And generosity where there is greed.
[1663.84 → 1665.84] And trust where there is anxiety.
[1665.84 → 1668.84] And holiness where there is sin.
[1668.84 → 1669.84] Okay?
[1669.84 → 1676.84] So, God not only forgives us, but he works in our lives by the Holy Spirit so that we become more and more beautiful.
[1676.84 → 1678.84] And God will do this.
[1678.84 → 1680.84] And we get to experience some of it now.
[1680.84 → 1684.84] But we wait for it to come in its fullness when the Lord returns.
[1684.84 → 1686.84] Thanks be to God.
[1686.84 → 1693.84] So, let's stand and let's sing again another song of praise to the Lord.
[1693.84 → 1714.84] God, let's sing again another song of praise to the Lord.
[1714.84 → 1724.84] God, let's sing again another song of praise to the Lord.
[1724.84 → 1726.84] God, let's sing again another song of praise to the Lord.
[1726.84 → 1731.84] Jesus Christ, we're the Lord.
[1731.84 → 1752.10] is
[1752.10 → 1757.36] others
[1757.36 → 1759.72] Peace out.
[1760.10 → 1766.84] Peace out.
[1767.78 → 1770.50] Open the Sang and return.
[1770.78 → 1773.64] Peace out.
[1776.40 → 1778.42] Peace out.
[1778.42 → 1780.48] that
[1780.48 → 1784.96] yes
[1784.96 → 1791.18] yes
[1791.18 → 1795.88] yes
[1796.02 → 1798.48] yeah
[1798.48 → 1806.60] yeah
[1806.60 → 1808.24] oh
[1808.24 → 1813.78] God of you that I have found
[1813.78 → 1818.24] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1818.24 → 1823.24] Oh, precious is the flow
[1823.86 → 1828.24] That makes me as a storm
[1828.94 → 1833.62] Still water, sure, but sure
[1833.62 → 1838.22] And enjoy the joy of Jesus
[1838.22 → 1843.98] Yet, from this floodgate
[1843.98 → 1845.40] He also awakened the billions
[1845.40 → 1850.26] The pain to the Fearful Spirit
[1850.26 → 1852.24] It brought you with them
[1852.24 → 1853.86] The wisdom of Jesus
[1853.86 → 1858.20] And could you fur die of Jesus
[1858.20 → 1859.26] The joy of Jesus
[1859.26 → 1864.20] surge, there really is
[1864.20 → 1865.28] You will not chant
[1865.28 → 1874.68] Each takes me long to But if I'm choosing Juliet
[1875.12 → 1878.10] With a day that NFC сцен,
[1878.14 → 1879.14] Each notepad,
[1879.14 → 1881.28] After the Galaxy of Kenmore Hind
[1881.30 → 1885.28] Each takes me long to But if I'm choosing Juliet
[1885.30 → 1890.74] With Tommy'sображ
[1890.76 → 1894.68] Each takes me long to But if I'm choosing Juliet
[1894.68 → 1906.82] You may be seated.
[1906.82 → 1925.30] So brothers and sisters, we come now to the table of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1925.30 → 1935.84] A table whose imagery and reality points to the death of our Lord Jesus, and yet also
[1935.84 → 1938.24] to the hope of the resurrection.
[1939.12 → 1941.14] And it's all here in this meal.
[1942.42 → 1947.70] And so by receiving this bread and this wine by the power of the Holy Spirit through faith
[1947.70 → 1954.90] in Jesus, our hearts are united to Jesus Christ, who sits this very morning at the right hand
[1954.90 → 1958.74] of God the Father, and who will come back one day.
[1959.44 → 1965.08] And our lives even now are hidden with Christ in God at the Father's right hand.
[1965.68 → 1970.36] And he will be revealed in glory in us with him.
[1971.72 → 1979.32] And so as we celebrate this meal, we do so as we wait, and as we long, and as we walk in
[1979.32 → 1985.26] the pattern of our Saviour, who allowed his body to be broken so that we might be healed.
[1986.12 → 1991.48] And friends, if this is your faith, then this meal is for you.
[1991.48 → 1999.66] For all those who have been united to Jesus Christ by faith, for whom you, I mean, and
[1999.66 → 2003.84] you believe that Jesus died for you, and he rose again for you.
[2003.84 → 2010.10] Then Jesus invites you to feast with him at this table, which is a foretaste of the heavenly
[2010.10 → 2011.94] banquet which we wait for.
[2012.76 → 2020.66] Now, if you are here and this is not yet your faith, that you're not sure if Jesus died for
[2020.66 → 2030.00] you or what that means, then instead of receiving these elements today, I would ask that you consider
[2030.00 → 2037.08] to receive Jesus Christ, to receive him and what he has done for you, to put your trust
[2037.08 → 2037.48] in him.
[2037.96 → 2042.02] And if you want to talk to me about that after the service, I would love to talk to you about
[2042.02 → 2042.30] that.
[2043.30 → 2050.30] But this meal today is for all of those young and old who know and love our Saviour Jesus
[2050.30 → 2052.18] Christ and who look to him for mercy.
[2053.42 → 2057.18] And so let me pray for us as we come to this meal.
[2057.58 → 2058.36] Please join me in prayer.
[2058.36 → 2063.56] Our Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you in praise and adoration.
[2064.88 → 2067.96] Lord, we are in awe of your love for us.
[2069.42 → 2078.62] And we pray now that you would set apart this bread and this cup for your holy purposes so
[2078.62 → 2084.70] that by the power of your Holy Spirit working through faith, our hearts would truly be united
[2084.70 → 2088.72] to our Saviour Jesus Christ, even this morning.
[2089.92 → 2096.92] Lord, would you lift our hearts to heaven as we feast, anticipating and waiting and longing
[2096.92 → 2097.68] for your return.
[2098.30 → 2104.40] Lord, bless this meal that we are about to receive, that it might nourish us spiritually
[2104.40 → 2111.98] and encourage us on the way as we follow a crucified and risen Saviour.
[2112.48 → 2114.02] We pray in Christ's name.
[2114.68 → 2114.96] Amen.
[2114.96 → 2121.18] So brothers and sisters, the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed, he took bread
[2121.18 → 2127.62] and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you.
[2128.18 → 2130.38] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2131.32 → 2135.76] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup saying, this cup is the new covenant in
[2135.76 → 2136.34] my blood.
[2136.34 → 2141.46] As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.
[2142.26 → 2148.18] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
[2148.18 → 2149.08] he comes again.
[2150.94 → 2157.90] So friends, our liturgy, lift your hearts.
[2158.90 → 2160.54] We lift them up to the Lord.
[2161.20 → 2162.28] We are his people.
[2163.08 → 2165.30] We are redeemed by his grace.
[2165.30 → 2168.06] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith.
[2168.74 → 2169.98] Christ has died.
[2170.44 → 2171.48] Christ is risen.
[2172.02 → 2173.42] Christ will come again.
[2174.22 → 2177.36] Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
[2177.78 → 2178.14] Hallelujah.
[2178.92 → 2179.56] Hallelujah.
[2180.24 → 2182.94] Friends, these are the gifts of God for you, his people.
[2183.96 → 2192.90] Receive them and take them in faith, remembering, believing, and trusting in what Christ has done
[2192.90 → 2193.76] for you on the cross.
[2193.76 → 2200.92] May I now ask our elders and deacons who are serving to come up and help me distribute the
[2200.92 → 2201.22] elements.
[2201.22 → 2209.28] Thank you.

[2624.68 → 2632.00] Brothers and sisters, you and I are sinners, but the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin.
[2632.52 → 2633.40] Let's drink together.
[2644.66 → 2645.88] Would you join me in prayer?
[2646.32 → 2646.98] Let's pray together.
[2646.98 → 2660.60] Lord, we thank you that you are the Lord, the master of the feast, that we are your guests, that you have called us, invited us to eat at your table at your expense.
[2661.90 → 2673.50] And Lord, it is the richest meal that we could ever eat, the most costly, because it came at the cost of the sacrifice of yourself in our place.
[2673.50 → 2676.98] So that you could offer us a seat at your heavenly banquet.
[2677.94 → 2686.12] Lord, we thank you for the great invitation and the great adoption that we have received to be called your sons and daughters.
[2687.04 → 2696.42] Lord, would you empower us through this meal and through the rest of our worship today to live for you and to serve you as king.
[2696.58 → 2697.52] We pray in Christ's name.
[2697.94 → 2698.14] Amen.
[2698.14 → 2698.28] Amen.
[2700.52 → 2700.96] All right.
[2701.10 → 2704.44] Let's all stand, and we're going to sing another song of praise together.
[2704.44 → 2704.92] Amen.
[2704.92 → 2705.02] Amen.
[2705.02 → 2705.06] Amen.
[2705.06 → 2705.56] Amen.
[2705.56 → 2706.84] Amen.
[2706.84 → 2707.14] Amen.
[2707.14 → 2707.42] Amen.
[2707.42 → 2707.54] Amen.
[2707.54 → 2707.82] Amen.
[2707.82 → 2708.08] Amen.
[2708.08 → 2708.16] Amen.
[2708.16 → 2708.18] Amen.
[2708.18 → 2708.64] Amen.
[2708.64 → 2708.74] Amen.
[2708.74 → 2708.78] Amen.
[2728.14 → 2748.14] I'm so glad you came to save us.
[2748.14 → 2759.14] I came from heaven to earth, to show the world, from the earth to trust my day.
[2759.14 → 2771.14] To show from the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky, Lord I have to make my heart.
[2771.14 → 2794.14] I will give you my heart. I will give you my heart. I will give you my heart.
[2794.14 → 2803.14] You're a sinner, you're a sinner. I will give you my heart.
[2803.14 → 2807.14] I'll give you my heart. I will give you my heart.
[2807.14 → 2814.14] I'm so glad you came to save you. Let me give you my heart.
[2814.14 → 2819.14] I will give you my heart.
[2819.14 → 2836.00] So at this time, our children are dismissed to their Sunday school classes,
[2836.00 → 2844.00] and our Chinese brothers and sisters will go to hear sermon in Mandarin.
[2849.14 → 2875.66] For those of you who didn't leave, thank you.
[2879.14 → 2887.58] Okay, so today, as I mentioned, is Palm Sunday.
[2888.22 → 2893.80] And the church on Palm Sunday, we remember Jesus' entry into the city of Jerusalem.
[2894.76 → 2899.40] It's the beginning of what we call Holy Week, the final week of Jesus' life.
[2899.86 → 2904.64] And, you know, as I said at the beginning, Holy Week leads to the cross on Good Friday
[2904.64 → 2908.40] and culminates in the resurrection of our Lord on Easter Sunday.
[2909.78 → 2918.62] And Holy Week is about what happens when the Holy God, the creator of heaven and earth, draws near to us.
[2918.62 → 2926.68] And this works out nicely, because over the last five weeks, we were in a sermon series on the book of Lamentations.
[2927.34 → 2934.30] And now it's about how in our lament, we ask the Holy God to draw near to us.
[2935.50 → 2941.04] And so now, on this Palm Sunday, we see what happens when God does draw near.
[2941.04 → 2944.36] And he does so in the person of Jesus.
[2945.24 → 2950.38] Now, this event that we celebrate is recorded in all four Gospels.
[2951.22 → 2954.86] But we will be reading it today from the Gospel of Matthew.
[2955.40 → 2958.98] So I invite you to turn in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 21.
[2958.98 → 2973.56] And it's amazing, as you turn there, I'll mention this, that in the Gospels, about a quarter often of the whole Gospel is devoted to this last week of Jesus' life.
[2974.02 → 2974.56] A full quarter.
[2974.74 → 2976.54] In the Gospel of John, it's almost a whole half.
[2978.36 → 2980.22] But I can't talk and flip at the same time.
[2981.48 → 2981.70] All right.
[2984.38 → 2985.22] Okay, here we are.
[2985.22 → 2989.10] We're on page 734 in your pew Bible.
[2990.02 → 2991.34] Matthew chapter 21.
[2991.56 → 2994.80] And we're going to actually read all the way through verse 17.
[2995.76 → 2999.04] So let's turn our attention to the reading of God's Word.
[3000.12 → 3004.74] As they approached Jerusalem and came to Beth page on the Mount of Olives,
[3005.54 → 3008.00] Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
[3008.42 → 3012.18] Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there,
[3012.58 → 3014.10] with her colt by her.
[3014.10 → 3017.32] Untie them and bring them to me.
[3017.94 → 3024.32] If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.
[3025.08 → 3028.42] This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet.
[3029.12 → 3030.58] Say to the daughter of Zion,
[3030.92 → 3038.56] See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
[3039.28 → 3043.06] The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
[3043.06 → 3049.36] They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
[3050.28 → 3053.76] A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
[3054.12 → 3057.42] while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
[3057.84 → 3061.54] The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,
[3061.54 → 3063.96] Hosanna to the son of David.
[3064.62 → 3067.66] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[3067.76 → 3069.02] Hosanna in the highest.
[3070.16 → 3074.70] When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked,
[3075.20 → 3076.14] Who is this?
[3076.14 → 3077.76] The crowds answered,
[3077.88 → 3081.10] This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.
[3082.48 → 3086.52] Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there.
[3087.06 → 3091.88] He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
[3092.54 → 3094.26] It is written, he said to them,
[3094.64 → 3099.08] My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.
[3099.08 → 3103.74] The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
[3104.56 → 3108.64] But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did,
[3109.08 → 3111.28] and the children shouting in the temple area,
[3111.64 → 3113.06] Hosanna to the son of David,
[3113.64 → 3114.80] they were indignant.
[3115.52 → 3117.34] Do you hear what these children are saying?
[3117.78 → 3118.38] They asked him.
[3118.82 → 3120.10] Yes, replied Jesus.
[3120.78 → 3121.58] Have you never read?
[3122.02 → 3125.54] From the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise.
[3125.54 → 3131.18] And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany where he spent the night.
[3131.84 → 3133.06] This is the word of the Lord.
[3133.62 → 3134.66] Thank you, God.
[3136.16 → 3140.80] Let's pray together, asking for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[3143.92 → 3150.62] Father, we come before you this morning thankful for the riches of your grace
[3150.62 → 3156.64] that you have so wonderfully revealed to us that shine like gems in your holy word.
[3157.80 → 3162.38] And I ask, Lord, this morning, we ask that the words of my mouth
[3162.38 → 3166.06] and the meditations of our many hearts would be acceptable in your sight,
[3166.70 → 3169.58] O Lord, our maker and our redeemer.
[3170.40 → 3170.76] Amen.
[3170.76 → 3179.20] On Palm Sunday, Jesus enters Jerusalem as a king.
[3180.42 → 3181.16] As a king.
[3182.14 → 3184.04] And the way he does this,
[3184.58 → 3186.80] everything that we see unfold in this passage
[3186.80 → 3194.72] is because Jesus is intentionally orchestrating all of these symbolic actions.
[3194.72 → 3197.40] And he's doing all of these things.
[3197.44 → 3198.74] And they all have meaning.
[3199.32 → 3203.36] And all of it points to that he is the king of the Jews.
[3204.38 → 3209.78] So here is the coronation portrait of King Charles.
[3211.26 → 3214.86] He is holding a sceptre.
[3214.86 → 3221.92] He has a royal kingly cloak over his shoulders that he is wearing.
[3222.06 → 3223.64] He has a crown upon his head.
[3223.86 → 3225.94] He's holding a globe in his hand.
[3226.38 → 3232.56] These are all symbolic visual statements that mean something.
[3233.14 → 3233.26] Right?
[3233.34 → 3234.28] This all means something.
[3234.40 → 3235.20] It's not just random.
[3236.32 → 3240.30] And in the same way, that is what is happening here in our passage.
[3240.84 → 3243.30] It's known as the triumphal entry.
[3243.30 → 3246.32] And what it is, is a lived out drama.
[3246.48 → 3249.10] It's not a snapshot, but it is a motion picture.
[3249.66 → 3253.14] And everything Jesus is doing, everything that's happening, is deeply symbolic.
[3254.16 → 3260.60] And what it does, it's publicly revealing to everyone who Jesus is as king.
[3261.30 → 3270.50] But it's also drastically recalibrating the people's expectations of what Jesus came to do.
[3270.50 → 3275.62] So I want to explore two questions as we look at our passage this morning.
[3275.86 → 3278.48] The first question is, who is Jesus as king?
[3279.08 → 3281.86] Who do we see Jesus is from this passage?
[3282.50 → 3285.18] And then the second question is, how do we then respond?
[3285.62 → 3287.82] How do we respond to Jesus as the king?
[3288.26 → 3290.32] So that's our simple outline for today.
[3290.70 → 3291.74] Who is Jesus as king?
[3291.90 → 3293.68] How do we respond to him as king?
[3293.68 → 3296.98] So let's look, who is Jesus as king?
[3297.56 → 3298.46] That's the first point.
[3299.56 → 3302.64] In other words, what kind of king is he?
[3303.94 → 3308.94] Now, to discover that, let's look at some of the details that we see in our passage.
[3308.94 → 3314.16] So Jesus, his disciples, they arrive right outside the city of Jerusalem.
[3314.90 → 3319.88] And Jesus says to his disciples, go into the village and here is what is going to happen.
[3320.16 → 3322.76] You're going to find a donkey and a colt.
[3323.46 → 3325.56] And you are going to fetch them for me.
[3326.08 → 3331.82] And if somebody asks you and says, hey, you say to them, hey, the Lord needs them.
[3331.82 → 3337.94] And the owner of these donkeys and the foal will send them to you right away.
[3339.14 → 3344.26] And so what we see here is Jesus is large and in charge, so to speak.
[3344.64 → 3348.74] He knows what is going to happen, and he is orchestrating it.
[3349.56 → 3355.78] And also, who walks into a town and grabs a random animal and says, I need this.
[3356.50 → 3360.22] If you go up to the Hamming's farm and say, hey, give me a cow.
[3360.22 → 3362.58] How would that go?
[3363.58 → 3364.46] It wouldn't go well.
[3365.04 → 3366.34] But who does that?
[3366.58 → 3367.10] A king.
[3368.16 → 3369.28] A king does that.
[3369.44 → 3371.78] Anybody else would be chased away with a farm implement.
[3372.96 → 3378.84] And we're told in Mark's account that it was an animal that nobody has ever ridden on before.
[3379.94 → 3383.46] And in that culture, it means that this was a special animal.
[3383.58 → 3385.68] It was set apart for special use.
[3385.68 → 3390.76] So it's like, imagine you go to a car dealer and you got a brand-new car.
[3391.70 → 3394.80] Nobody has ever driven this car before.
[3395.08 → 3400.16] And you're driving home, and it has that new car smell and nobody's ever ridden in it.
[3400.86 → 3402.84] And I don't know what donkeys smell like.
[3403.44 → 3405.72] But that's kind of the idea.
[3405.90 → 3409.66] There's this, it's an unridden horse or donkey.
[3409.66 → 3414.24] And what that means is that it was an animal fit for a king.
[3415.68 → 3418.66] Matthew then even quotes Zechariah chapter 9.
[3418.78 → 3423.92] He says, say to the daughter Zion, see your king comes.
[3424.64 → 3425.36] We're not there yet.
[3426.68 → 3427.32] Thanks.
[3427.32 → 3434.12] So if you want a chapter and verse that says, look, Jesus is king.
[3434.56 → 3436.72] Zechariah 9 is where you go.
[3437.90 → 3441.78] And Matthew explicitly names Jesus as king by quoting Zechariah 9.
[3442.72 → 3447.58] And so imagine the energy on that road leading into Jerusalem.
[3447.72 → 3449.30] It must have been electric.
[3450.28 → 3455.40] And, you know, imagine a parade on Canada Day and people are shouting or another, a coronation day.
[3455.40 → 3458.36] And there's an excitement in the air.
[3459.22 → 3460.40] Jesus mounts this colt.
[3461.26 → 3462.48] He rides into the city.
[3462.98 → 3467.70] People are shouting, Hosanna, which means, save us.
[3468.56 → 3469.86] Oh, save us.
[3470.16 → 3477.52] And it's this calling out to the Lord in praise, saying, this is our king who is going to deliver us from everything that oppresses us.
[3477.90 → 3478.42] Hosanna.
[3479.52 → 3480.44] Salvation is here.
[3480.76 → 3481.92] The Messiah is here.
[3481.92 → 3489.42] And notice, Jesus doesn't silence the crowds as they shout, Hosanna.
[3489.50 → 3490.54] He's not like, aw, shucks.
[3491.18 → 3492.14] You don't have to say that.
[3492.82 → 3500.92] He doesn't say, you know, as, you know, think about all the times that Jesus does like a miracle of healing or another kind of miracle in the Gospels.
[3500.92 → 3506.68] And then the people who are healed or who witness it says, you are the Lord.
[3507.50 → 3508.66] You are the Messiah.
[3508.82 → 3509.62] You are the Christ.
[3510.54 → 3512.80] And Jesus will often say, be silent.
[3512.94 → 3513.88] Don't tell anybody.
[3514.10 → 3515.62] It's not yet time.
[3516.72 → 3520.46] But here the crowds are shouting, Hosanna to the son of David.
[3520.86 → 3522.70] And he does not silence them.
[3522.70 → 3529.48] He is saying, in a sense, now is the time for people to know who I am.
[3529.96 → 3531.10] I am the king.
[3532.16 → 3534.12] People were taking off their cloaks.
[3534.38 → 3540.44] They were taking off their jackets, throwing them down on the road, making this royal carpet for Jesus to walk on.
[3540.70 → 3542.46] He doesn't tell them not to do it.
[3543.46 → 3543.58] Right?
[3543.58 → 3545.16] He's like, yeah, that's about right.
[3545.70 → 3546.68] Because I am the king.
[3547.96 → 3556.22] And so Jesus is presenting himself unashamedly, publicly, as the king of the Jews.
[3557.72 → 3562.22] Remember, it's the title that hung over his birth.
[3563.04 → 3564.36] Remember in Matthew, what happens?
[3564.42 → 3568.80] The wise men, they come to see the baby Jesus.
[3568.80 → 3576.16] They go to King Herod, and they say, they ask, where is he who is born king of the Jews?
[3577.74 → 3581.60] And then it's the title that hangs over not only his birth, but over his death.
[3582.02 → 3586.08] As he's wearing that crown of thorns, as he's hanging upon the cross,
[3586.62 → 3591.76] the soldiers put a sign above his head that lists the charge against him, the crime.
[3592.62 → 3595.48] This is Jesus, king of the Jews.
[3595.48 → 3603.50] And so his whole life, his birth to his death, and now his riding into Jerusalem,
[3603.84 → 3606.10] is proclaiming Jesus is the king.
[3607.08 → 3611.14] He's claiming to be the long-awaited king of Israel, the son of David,
[3611.60 → 3616.84] returned to restore his people, to establish his kingdom.
[3618.24 → 3622.12] But this is where it gets fascinating, as if that wasn't interesting enough.
[3622.12 → 3629.24] Because the main point that Matthew wants us to notice about who Jesus is,
[3629.96 → 3630.98] is that he is humble.
[3632.04 → 3635.94] That's the main point Jesus is making as he rides into Jerusalem,
[3636.14 → 3640.58] not on a mighty war horse, as you would expect,
[3641.26 → 3647.56] but sitting on not just a donkey, a baby donkey, a colt.
[3647.56 → 3651.36] Kings don't ride colts.
[3651.88 → 3659.14] It just doesn't have that strong, regal, warrior vibe that you want to go for.
[3660.32 → 3663.66] But Jesus, he rides in on a colt.
[3664.72 → 3670.06] And if you look at the Zechariah passage that Matthew quotes in verse 5,
[3670.14 → 3670.74] what does it say?
[3670.74 → 3674.36] It says, I think we have it here, yeah.
[3675.20 → 3676.14] Verse 5 in Matthew,
[3676.62 → 3678.88] Say, and quoting Zechariah,
[3678.98 → 3681.82] Say to daughter Zion, see your king comes to you.
[3682.74 → 3683.28] How?
[3684.54 → 3685.06] Gentle.
[3685.80 → 3690.00] Riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
[3690.00 → 3696.32] Now, what is fascinating is when you go back to the Zechariah passage
[3696.32 → 3698.50] that Matthew is quoting in Zechariah chapter 9,
[3698.64 → 3702.78] and you read that passage in Zechariah in the Old Testament,
[3703.38 → 3706.22] you realize that Matthew has actually left out some words.
[3707.40 → 3711.06] Okay, he's left out two keywords from the verse.
[3711.58 → 3714.78] So here is Zechariah chapter 9, verse 9.
[3714.78 → 3718.62] Rejoice greatly, daughter Zion, shout, daughter Jerusalem.
[3718.80 → 3720.32] See, your king comes to you.
[3721.04 → 3721.40] How?
[3722.68 → 3724.40] Righteous and victorious.
[3725.94 → 3729.18] Lowly and riding on a donkey, on the colt, the foal of a donkey.
[3730.66 → 3732.26] Matthew left something out.
[3733.26 → 3734.80] Righteous and victorious.
[3735.20 → 3736.76] He just drops them right out.
[3737.92 → 3742.10] Now, it's not because Matthew doesn't think those are true of Jesus,
[3742.10 → 3748.50] but because he wants to draw our attention just to the fact that Jesus is lowly.
[3749.64 → 3754.36] And this word, gentle, lowly, it's the same word that Jesus uses earlier
[3754.36 → 3759.00] in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 11, when Jesus is describing his own heart.
[3759.98 → 3763.74] Where Jesus, it's the only place that Jesus describes his heart,
[3763.82 → 3765.84] and we read it earlier, but this is what it says.
[3766.10 → 3767.24] Jesus says, come to me.
[3767.24 → 3773.06] All who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[3773.50 → 3780.64] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[3780.82 → 3782.84] and you will find rest for your souls.
[3782.96 → 3783.12] Right?
[3783.16 → 3784.22] It's the same word, gentle.
[3784.76 → 3786.52] He is gentle and humble in heart.
[3786.78 → 3790.48] And it's not simply kind of what Jesus does, how he behaves.
[3790.84 → 3793.72] It is most fundamentally who he is.
[3793.72 → 3803.48] So as Jesus rides into Jerusalem, as the king of Israel mounted on a donkey on Palm Sunday,
[3803.86 → 3809.24] he's revealing not only that he is king, but also the kind of king he is.
[3809.94 → 3811.96] And you know, the crowd, they are so excited.
[3812.92 → 3814.10] Here comes the king.
[3815.16 → 3818.70] But the people didn't really understand who Jesus was.
[3819.40 → 3819.60] Right?
[3819.60 → 3827.38] They probably had a couple of things right about Jesus, but they also had quite a few things wrong about him.
[3827.90 → 3832.88] And I think Matthew seems to be emphasizing, actually, the people's confusion.
[3834.26 → 3834.48] Okay?
[3834.58 → 3836.38] The people's confusion about who Jesus is.
[3836.40 → 3838.62] And that brings us to our second point this morning.
[3839.64 → 3842.54] How do we respond to Jesus as king?
[3842.54 → 3852.66] And I think one of the ways that we can parse this out is to consider four of the different characters that we have in and around this story of the triumphal entry.
[3852.88 → 3857.90] How did all of these different people that we see in this passage, how did they respond to Jesus as king?
[3858.66 → 3862.80] And what does Jesus teach them and us about himself?
[3862.80 → 3873.18] And so with these four different characters, who we have is the disciples, we have the crowds, we have the religious leaders, and we have the blind and the lame.
[3873.48 → 3873.64] Okay?
[3873.68 → 3874.42] Four groups of people.
[3874.74 → 3876.14] So let's look at each of these briefly.
[3877.40 → 3879.12] First, let's talk about the disciples.
[3880.08 → 3887.34] So there's something pretty interesting where, did you notice how many disciples did Jesus send to go get the donkey and the colt?
[3887.48 → 3887.86] How many?
[3888.58 → 3889.24] Two, right?
[3889.24 → 3899.42] Now, just in the passage right before this, in chapter 20, two of Jesus' disciples, namely the brothers James and John,
[3899.98 → 3906.16] they see in Jesus a means of gaining status and authority.
[3906.96 → 3913.64] So we're told in Matthew 20, verse 21, that their mom approaches Jesus on their behalf
[3913.64 → 3919.76] and asks if Jesus would allow them to sit at Jesus' right hand and his left hand in his kingdom.
[3920.72 → 3932.82] Basically, can my two sons have the most important, powerful places, be the most important, powerful people, next to Jesus when he is king?
[3934.28 → 3938.82] And we're told a few verses later that the other disciples, when they heard about this, they are indignant.
[3939.28 → 3940.14] They are angry.
[3940.14 → 3943.22] And so we get to the triumphal entry.
[3944.48 → 3945.80] Jesus is in charge.
[3946.60 → 3950.00] And Matthew is careful to tell us that Jesus sends how many disciples?
[3950.82 → 3951.32] Two.
[3952.04 → 3955.02] To go and get the donkey.
[3955.90 → 3963.54] Now, it doesn't say explicitly, but I think it's likely that the two disciples Jesus sends are James and John.
[3963.54 → 3977.02] The two disciples who ask Jesus for positions of power and authority he sends to get a donkey, symbols of Jesus' humility and sacrifice.
[3978.56 → 3982.02] And so what lessons did the disciples need to learn about Jesus?
[3982.02 → 3988.88] Well, there's a quote that us reformed people know.
[3989.02 → 3991.54] It's from Abraham Kuiper, where he says, I'm paraphrasing,
[3992.04 → 3995.62] there's not one square inch of all creation that Jesus does not say,
[3995.98 → 3998.46] this is mine, and I will rule over it.
[3999.92 → 4001.98] All right, Jesus is the true king of the whole world.
[4001.98 → 4004.28] And his kingdom is spreading.
[4004.80 → 4009.92] And he loves to invite people, you and I, to participate in the spread of his kingdom.
[4010.12 → 4011.16] And it is exciting.
[4012.48 → 4020.00] But Jesus does not involve us in his ministry or in his mission to the world so that we can gain power and status.
[4020.00 → 4026.92] But so that we ourselves can become the sort of people who reflect his heart of humility.
[4028.08 → 4034.46] Hey, when Jesus calls us into the ministry of his kingdom, he does so, not so we can do great things for him,
[4034.80 → 4036.86] but so that we can learn to be like him.
[4038.16 → 4044.38] And when I, and I think that leads us to this question that Jesus would have us ask him,
[4044.38 → 4050.22] which is, how are you, Lord, inviting me to learn about your heart?
[4051.36 → 4059.40] In the place, the job, the circumstances among the people that you have placed me right now.
[4061.36 → 4066.50] You know, so often we want to run from the place that God has actually placed us.
[4067.84 → 4070.40] But maybe God has actually put us there
[4070.40 → 4076.74] because he knows not so much that he wants to do great things for you,
[4076.74 → 4080.36] but so that you will become more like him
[4080.36 → 4083.04] in gentleness and in humility.
[4084.82 → 4086.02] So that's the first one.
[4086.32 → 4087.04] So that's the disciples.
[4087.26 → 4090.30] Now, the second group of people we see is the crowds.
[4091.34 → 4093.82] Now, the crowds, what do they see in Jesus?
[4094.36 → 4100.24] They see a revolutionary prophet who can serve their political purposes.
[4101.36 → 4101.48] Right?
[4101.74 → 4107.30] They see one who can make the changes that they want to see in the world.
[4108.20 → 4111.30] I mean, who doesn't want any, somebody who, a political leader,
[4111.70 → 4114.86] who can do the things that you think really need to get done
[4114.86 → 4117.62] for society to be good and just and flourishing?
[4118.34 → 4118.56] Right?
[4118.60 → 4121.52] I'm sure if I gave each one of us here a piece of paper,
[4121.52 → 4128.24] you could fill out what you think the leaders of this country should be doing
[4128.24 → 4131.38] and that aren't, and they're not doing it.
[4132.18 → 4132.34] All right?
[4132.38 → 4136.36] We all have hopes and expectations for societal change,
[4136.74 → 4138.04] for things to get better.
[4138.04 → 4141.66] And that's what the crowds hoped in Jesus.
[4142.06 → 4147.96] But why did they have this expectation that Jesus would do this?
[4148.52 → 4152.78] Well, what we need to do now is just pan out the camera for a moment
[4152.78 → 4156.26] and look at a little bit of historical background.
[4157.18 → 4158.68] So I'm going to show you another image.
[4159.94 → 4160.62] Who's this guy?
[4162.46 → 4165.52] Well, 150 years before Jesus rode into Jerusalem,
[4165.64 → 4167.84] there was another man named Judas Maccabees.
[4168.50 → 4169.06] Here he is.
[4169.82 → 4170.44] What did he do?
[4170.52 → 4174.74] He led the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire,
[4175.12 → 4178.88] who were the Greek rulers over Jerusalem at that time.
[4178.88 → 4184.72] 150 years ago, from the time of Jesus, Jerusalem was oppressed.
[4185.28 → 4186.76] Jerusalem was not flourishing.
[4186.92 → 4187.80] Jerusalem was in trouble.
[4188.64 → 4190.54] They were ruled by occupiers.
[4191.50 → 4195.24] And so Judas Maccabees, this Jew, rose up an army
[4195.24 → 4200.12] and revolted against their overrules, the Greeks, and they won.
[4200.82 → 4201.46] It's amazing.
[4201.60 → 4202.40] It's an amazing story.
[4202.82 → 4206.20] And after this victory, the crowd celebrated
[4206.20 → 4208.52] Judas Maccabees' return to Jerusalem,
[4208.52 → 4209.66] how did they do it?
[4209.74 → 4210.48] I bet you can guess.
[4211.64 → 4213.52] Waving palm branches.
[4215.30 → 4219.16] Celebrating the returning king victorious in battle.
[4220.70 → 4223.54] Now, Judas Maccabees, he had a nickname, the Hammer.
[4224.76 → 4226.48] No one has ever given me that nickname.
[4227.68 → 4228.50] There's still time.
[4229.68 → 4232.46] But Judas Maccabees died at age 30.
[4233.42 → 4236.20] The Hammer, then he comes back.
[4236.20 → 4238.76] He changes the coins of the city of Jerusalem.
[4239.28 → 4242.26] And what do you think he stamped as a symbol on the coins?
[4243.36 → 4244.16] Palm branch.
[4245.34 → 4248.72] To remind God's people, we defeat our enemies.
[4249.38 → 4250.56] It's a symbol of victory.
[4250.56 → 4255.62] So when Jesus rides into Jerusalem, the crowds are waving palm branches.
[4256.02 → 4257.26] It's not just a cute story.
[4258.04 → 4263.08] They are ready for Jesus to be their second Judas Maccabees.
[4263.52 → 4268.12] To lead them in victory over the Romans to restore the glory of Israel.
[4268.12 → 4275.82] Now, when Napoleon returned home from his very successful campaigns in Austria and in Italy,
[4276.12 → 4279.28] he came back amid the shouts of the people and of celebration.
[4280.32 → 4281.38] And someone said to him,
[4281.38 → 4290.64] Napoleon replied,
[4290.64 → 4290.86] Napoleon replied,
[4290.86 → 4291.70] Nonsense.
[4292.70 → 4296.12] This same crowd, under a slightly different circumstance,
[4296.52 → 4300.06] would just as eagerly follow me to the scaffold.
[4300.06 → 4304.24] And that's exactly what happened to Jesus.
[4305.44 → 4305.60] Right?
[4305.78 → 4313.84] When Jesus maybe shows from our worldly eyes that he was a failed prophet.
[4314.02 → 4318.00] That he was not the revolutionary leader they were looking for.
[4318.06 → 4320.32] He was arrested by the Roman authorities.
[4321.34 → 4322.30] Their hopes had failed.
[4323.04 → 4324.36] And they quickly turned on him.
[4325.00 → 4328.04] On Sunday, they praised him with hosannas.
[4328.04 → 4330.64] On Friday, what do they shout?
[4331.96 → 4332.90] Crucify him.
[4335.20 → 4337.74] The lesson for us, one lesson,
[4338.44 → 4346.34] is that if our praise of Jesus is dependent on the change that you expect him to bring into your life
[4346.34 → 4347.78] or into the world,
[4348.34 → 4349.92] then he will quickly disappoint you.
[4351.04 → 4353.28] And your praises will not last very long.
[4354.32 → 4354.44] Right?
[4354.44 → 4359.10] So don't praise Jesus because you think he's going to help you bring the change in your life
[4359.10 → 4361.86] or in the world that you want.
[4362.10 → 4365.56] Because he has come to give you so much more.
[4366.54 → 4370.20] Something so much greater than what we often want from him.
[4372.14 → 4373.26] Okay, so we have the disciples.
[4373.46 → 4374.04] We have the crowds.
[4374.48 → 4376.10] Third, we have the religious leaders.
[4376.10 → 4379.34] Now these are the chief priests, the teachers of the law,
[4379.48 → 4381.74] and they see in Jesus a threat.
[4382.76 → 4384.68] A threat to their authority.
[4385.48 → 4388.60] A threat to their beloved traditions and way of life.
[4389.72 → 4392.04] And so actually, Jesus, he rides into Jerusalem.
[4393.10 → 4394.34] Then he goes to the temple.
[4395.00 → 4397.80] He overturns the money changers.
[4398.54 → 4400.62] And the teachers of the law and the Pharisees,
[4400.70 → 4402.64] they question Jesus about his authority.
[4402.64 → 4406.04] They say, what gives you the right to do what you are doing?
[4406.94 → 4410.88] And in response, notice that Jesus is not very Canadian.
[4411.96 → 4416.20] He does not quietly excuse himself to avoid confrontation.
[4417.30 → 4422.50] He critiques these religious authorities by telling them parables.
[4423.00 → 4427.74] And he warns them that the judgment of God is going to come upon them if they don't repent.
[4427.74 → 4433.84] So you see, Jesus, he's humble in heart, but he is not a pushover.
[4434.70 → 4437.00] He will charge into the temple courts.
[4437.24 → 4439.02] He will overturn tables.
[4439.32 → 4442.70] He will challenge the religious leaders who are leading the people astray.
[4443.88 → 4450.48] He opposes all those who are proud and who act like they don't need him.
[4450.48 → 4459.62] And the lesson we learn is that if we question Jesus' authority as king in our lives,
[4460.54 → 4466.90] he will confront us because he is too loving to leave us in the blindness of our pride.
[4466.90 → 4477.58] So the question for us is to ask, are there areas in my life where I have maybe a beloved tradition,
[4477.96 → 4482.00] a beloved way of life, a beloved thought, whatever,
[4482.36 → 4485.88] that is not aligned with who Jesus is in his kingdom?
[4486.44 → 4491.62] Where do we need to submit to the reign of Christ more in our lives?
[4491.62 → 4497.22] So we've had the disciples, the crowds, the religious leaders.
[4497.62 → 4501.02] They all were confused a bit about who Jesus was and what he came to do.
[4501.50 → 4503.60] Then finally, we have the blind and the lame.
[4504.44 → 4510.76] Now, I love how this episode of the triumphal entry is kind of book ended before and after
[4510.76 → 4513.28] by Jesus healing the blind and the lame.
[4514.12 → 4516.78] So in verse 14, well, in our passage,
[4516.78 → 4520.80] right after Jesus rides into Jerusalem, it says,
[4520.94 → 4525.86] the blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
[4527.44 → 4532.02] Right before the triumphal entry, as Jesus and his disciples are heading into Jerusalem,
[4532.54 → 4534.58] there are two blind men sitting on the side of the road.
[4535.04 → 4536.20] They call out to Jesus,
[4536.78 → 4539.86] Lord, son of David, have mercy on us.
[4540.60 → 4542.76] And it says Jesus had compassion on them.
[4542.76 → 4546.84] He touched their eyes, they received their sight, and they followed Jesus.
[4548.02 → 4550.04] They were part of that crowd that followed him.
[4550.84 → 4555.94] And it shows exactly the sort of people that this king came to serve.
[4557.00 → 4560.08] The blind, the lame,
[4560.88 → 4563.18] they see in Jesus the source of mercy.
[4563.98 → 4565.98] They see in Jesus the Lord of healing.
[4566.86 → 4572.62] They see that he is the humble king who is fond of the humble.
[4573.76 → 4577.50] That he will not deny anyone who cries out to him for help.
[4578.40 → 4583.00] That he will not cast away anyone who cries out to him for mercy.
[4583.96 → 4588.20] That Jesus, he will not ignore anyone who comes to him for rest
[4588.20 → 4591.40] or condemn anyone who asks for his forgiveness.
[4592.24 → 4595.94] He has compassion towards all those who need his help and who ask for it.
[4596.62 → 4596.84] Right?
[4596.90 → 4601.70] Whether it's the blind and the lame or the children or the tax collectors or prostitutes,
[4601.70 → 4607.62] anyone who comes to him for mercy and who know they need it,
[4607.92 → 4609.60] he will receive.
[4611.20 → 4613.18] And so what is the lesson for us here?
[4613.18 → 4616.70] Be like the blind and the lame.
[4617.64 → 4618.58] Come to Jesus.
[4619.32 → 4620.02] That's the lesson.
[4621.14 → 4624.62] He is the king who came into Jerusalem carrying the sins
[4624.62 → 4630.08] and the brokenness and the burdens of the world on his shoulders.
[4630.08 → 4636.12] And he is the king who welcomes sinners and sufferers while resisting the proud.
[4636.90 → 4641.80] And he is the king who despises the fickle fame of the crowds
[4641.80 → 4648.98] and instead chooses a crown of thorns and a throne which is a cross.
[4648.98 → 4651.94] He wasn't a revolutionary prophet.
[4652.26 → 4653.38] He wasn't a wonder worker.
[4653.82 → 4655.90] He wasn't a keeper of the religious status quo.
[4656.86 → 4662.30] He was the king who has come to save the lost and the lowly,
[4662.82 → 4665.70] whoever they are, wherever they may be found.
[4667.12 → 4671.28] And so he comes to his disciples, to the crowds, to the religious leaders,
[4671.52 → 4672.56] to the blind and the lame.
[4672.88 → 4674.62] And friends, he comes to you this morning.
[4674.62 → 4680.42] He comes to you this morning, and he declares that he is the king
[4680.42 → 4687.40] and he invites you to follow him and to find your life in him.
[4689.02 → 4690.84] That's the invitation of this passage.
[4691.44 → 4692.24] Let's pray together.
[4696.20 → 4699.50] Heavenly Father, we thank you that on this day in history,
[4700.46 → 4702.92] Palm Sunday, your son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4702.92 → 4706.10] he rode into Jerusalem to be crowned king.
[4707.06 → 4708.66] And we pray that, Lord, today,
[4709.76 → 4711.66] just as you rode into the city,
[4711.74 → 4713.92] that you would ride into our hearts
[4713.92 → 4717.18] and that there you would be crowned king
[4717.18 → 4719.96] so that we might not only worship you,
[4720.08 → 4723.46] but also, Lord, participate in your kingdom
[4723.46 → 4724.90] here and now.
[4725.94 → 4726.88] In your name we pray.
[4727.28 → 4727.62] Amen.
[4727.62 → 4727.72] Amen.
[4727.72 → 4736.20] As the musicians and singers come up,
[4736.26 → 4738.92] let's all stand, and we'll sing our Song of Response.
[4738.92 → 4768.90] piano plays softly

[4852.92 → 4854.92] piano plays softly
[4854.92 → 4858.92] piano plays softly
[4858.92 → 4869.28] We lead us from our fathers, the passion was erased.
[4869.28 → 4879.56] The sacrifice to your kingdom, of justice, truth and grace.
[4879.56 → 4889.56] We shall have an old son, we have a wise of me.
[4889.56 → 4898.56] Us to us, to us, to us, to us, to praise we sing.
[4899.70 → 4908.56] Send us, learn truth, this word, our justice is in our land.
[4908.56 → 4918.10] Then move our hearts to our altar, no doubt, no vision now.
[4918.10 → 4918.64] Amen.
[4918.64 → 4919.32] Amen.
[4919.32 → 4921.56] Amen.
[4921.56 → 4921.86] Amen.
[4922.86 → 4923.36] Amen.
[4923.36 → 4923.70] Amen.
[4923.70 → 4923.86] Amen.
[4924.24 → 4924.26] Amen.
[4924.26 → 4924.32] Amen.
[4924.32 → 4924.64] Amen.
[4925.32 → 4925.38] Amen.
[4925.38 → 4926.38] Amen.
[4926.38 → 4926.74] Amen.
[4926.88 → 4927.18] Amen.
[4927.18 → 4927.28] Amen.
[4927.28 → 4927.70] Amen.
[4927.70 → 4928.58] Amen.
[4928.58 → 4928.78] Amen.
[4928.78 → 4929.42] Amen.
[4929.42 → 4929.52] Amen.
[4929.52 → 4929.60] Amen.
[4929.60 → 4930.90] Amen.
[4930.90 → 4931.52] Amen.
[4931.52 → 4937.62] One of the ways that we worship our King and participate in His Kingdom is by giving of our
[4937.62 → 4945.44] tithes and offerings as a way to express our worship to Him and also to express our willingness
[4945.44 → 4946.76] to participate in his kingdom.
[4947.62 → 4950.30] And we do so in partnership with some different organizations.
[4950.54 → 4953.94] The one for today that we support is called Servants Anonymous.
[4954.80 → 4959.02] And, you know, talking about going into the world and seeking justice,
[4959.02 → 4964.14] this is a group that seeks to help women, mostly now some men,
[4964.48 → 4967.44] who are enslaved in sex trafficking.
[4968.32 → 4971.68] And so it's a great organization that we support as a church.
[4972.64 → 4976.66] And may I ask our deacons to come forward and collect our morning offering.

[5111.30 → 5112.04] Yale Eve
[5112.32 → 5114.26] So I invite you to lean in, and pray with me.
[5114.26 → 5115.54] Let's pray together.
[5119.22 → 5121.22] Our Lord Jesus, son of David.
[5123.22 → 5126.36] You enter Jerusalem with a triumphal procession.
[5128.30 → 5132.62] That in the days that followed left you alone and abandoned and abused.
[5132.62 → 5136.76] and in the humiliation of the cross.
[5137.48 → 5140.36] We thank you and praise you for your selfless sacrifice
[5140.36 → 5144.58] for our redemption and for your mercy towards us.
[5144.74 → 5148.50] Lord, your life was not taken from you, you offered it
[5148.50 → 5152.78] in complete control, orchestrating our salvation.
[5153.58 → 5154.46] And Lord, we praise you.
[5155.96 → 5161.00] May, Lord, you display and grant your mercy
[5161.00 → 5167.34] in the lives of women caught in the trap of sex trafficking
[5167.34 → 5168.82] all around the world.
[5169.50 → 5171.48] Lord, we pray for the work of Servants Anonymous.
[5171.48 → 5174.26] We ask, Lord, that you would work through this ministry
[5174.26 → 5176.74] to be your hands and feet of mercy
[5176.74 → 5180.48] to help many women and children
[5180.48 → 5182.96] who are in need of your rescue.
[5183.50 → 5185.24] You are the God who rescues.
[5186.26 → 5189.46] And would you provide, Lord, for the financial needs
[5189.46 → 5191.46] of this organization so that they may continue
[5191.46 → 5194.26] to do the good work that you've given them to do.
[5195.10 → 5199.06] Lord, give your strength to the staff and the workers,
[5199.32 → 5200.80] whether they are here in Canada
[5200.80 → 5203.62] or working in various places around the world.
[5205.76 → 5207.42] Thank you, Lord, for Holy Week.
[5208.16 → 5211.50] We pray that we would seek you this week, Lord,
[5211.50 → 5213.20] that you would help each one of us here
[5213.20 → 5220.06] to slow down and to receive you
[5220.06 → 5221.42] as you draw near to us.
[5222.20 → 5224.80] Help us, Lord, to rest in your promise
[5224.80 → 5227.10] that you are indeed with us,
[5227.90 → 5229.94] in your promise that you rose from the dead
[5229.94 → 5232.58] to give us life and to be our life.
[5233.54 → 5235.34] Lord, as we look around the world,
[5235.44 → 5237.48] we see wars and destruction.
[5237.48 → 5242.30] We see what's still going on in Gaza and in Ukraine.
[5242.94 → 5244.56] We see the war in Sudan,
[5245.40 → 5246.70] the civil war in Magmar,
[5247.56 → 5249.22] conflicts in other places.
[5250.26 → 5253.08] Lord, we see a trade war that is causing
[5253.08 → 5255.22] much disruption and much anxiety.
[5256.72 → 5259.36] But, Lord, we're reminded of your word that says
[5259.36 → 5262.12] you make wars cease to the ends of the earth.
[5262.12 → 5265.50] And so, indeed, Lord, would you bring an end
[5265.50 → 5269.54] to our many conflicts that we cause.
[5270.46 → 5272.54] Lord, would you be exalted among the nations.
[5273.68 → 5276.66] Lord, we continue to pray for Pastor Jeff of Latter-Baptist
[5276.66 → 5281.20] as he seeks time away for healing and renewal.
[5281.92 → 5284.06] Lord, provide the needs of Latter-Baptist Church,
[5284.16 → 5285.06] our brothers and sisters,
[5285.90 → 5290.56] as they seek to be led through this time of uncertainty.
[5290.56 → 5293.72] Lord, we pray for the many sick among us.
[5294.30 → 5296.44] We pray especially still for Michael Wayne.
[5296.76 → 5298.16] We pray for, Lord, his healing.
[5299.68 → 5302.84] And, Lord, that you'd be an ever-present help
[5302.84 → 5305.26] in times of trouble for him and for all of us.
[5306.34 → 5308.22] Lord, but for him, give wisdom to the doctors
[5308.22 → 5311.80] as they continue to seek out the best treatment for him.
[5312.82 → 5314.10] Lord, we are thankful, too,
[5314.74 → 5316.12] that we look to the day
[5316.12 → 5320.86] when we'll join with all peoples
[5320.86 → 5322.26] who are called by your name,
[5322.94 → 5324.94] declaring Hosanna to the Son of David.
[5325.62 → 5327.72] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[5328.40 → 5329.52] We pray in Christ's name.
[5329.86 → 5330.10] Amen.
[5334.72 → 5337.24] I'll take this time to give a quick update.
[5337.36 → 5338.82] I think it was like six weeks ago
[5338.82 → 5340.64] I told you about a call I had received.
[5341.64 → 5343.58] And the update for today is
[5343.58 → 5345.20] I'm almost decided.
[5347.22 → 5349.26] So thank you for your patience.
[5349.46 → 5350.50] I know a lot of people are asking,
[5350.72 → 5351.68] so I thought it'd be fair,
[5352.26 → 5354.08] you know, and with the council's encouragement
[5354.08 → 5355.92] also to give you a little update.
[5356.72 → 5358.06] Continue to hold us up in prayer.
[5358.56 → 5360.58] But we, I think we have a decision soon,
[5360.98 → 5362.06] and you will,
[5362.32 → 5363.66] I'll try to let you know as soon as I can.
[5364.92 → 5365.82] So that's the update.
[5366.28 → 5367.38] Thank you for your patience.
[5368.52 → 5369.48] Would you please rise?
[5370.64 → 5371.08] Amen.
[5372.66 → 5375.78] So we'll go out with the Lord's blessing upon us,
[5376.18 → 5377.72] and I invite you to join us
[5377.72 → 5379.16] for a time of fellowship and coffee
[5379.16 → 5381.14] in the Fellowship Hall outside.
[5382.32 → 5384.12] Hold out your hands, brothers and sisters,
[5384.30 → 5385.22] to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5385.78 → 5387.74] Now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[5387.86 → 5389.16] the love of God the Father,
[5389.58 → 5390.92] the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[5390.92 → 5393.02] be with you now and always
[5393.02 → 5395.54] until the day of Christ's return.
[5396.18 → 5396.50] Amen.
[5396.50 → 5396.60] Amen.
[5396.60 → 5396.64] Amen.
[5396.64 → 5396.66] Amen.
[5400.64 → 5428.20] Lift your hands to the coming King,
[5428.20 → 5432.08] God before Him and adore Him sing.

[5432.58 → 5432.66] Amen.
[5432.66 → 5432.94] Amen.
[5432.94 → 5437.40] And adore him sing
[5439.80 → 5444.80] To his majesty
[5445.80 → 5448.74] the praise him
[5450.58 → 5452.58] Costa and glory
[5453.96 → 5456.16] Give it glory
[5456.46 → 5459.92] To Linked Oh King
[5459.92 → 5472.90] Good and holy, giving glory to the King of kings.
[5489.92 → 5491.92] Amen.
[5519.92 → 5521.92] Amen.
[5549.92 → 5551.92] Amen.
