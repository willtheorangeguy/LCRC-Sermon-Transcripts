[195.00 → 196.00] Good morning.
[196.00 → 207.00] Good morning, sorry, just waiting for the piano to finish.
[207.00 → 209.00] Good morning, and welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[209.00 → 215.48] Reformed Church this Sunday. We read in Matthew that when two or three gather in my name, I am
[215.48 → 222.92] there also. This morning we congregate with our Creator. My name is Ryan Van Viet and today I
[222.92 → 227.48] will be helping us guide us through the liturgy while Marian will be on piano with the rest of
[227.48 → 233.20] musicians guiding us in worshipping through song. And this morning as we heard last week,
[233.70 → 238.70] Pastor Jason is away. He'll be away for a few weeks visiting family in Virginia. So this morning
[238.70 → 244.44] we'll be welcoming Pastor Theo to the pulpit to bring us God's Word from Ephesians 144,
[245.14 → 250.30] or sorry, Psalm 144 in Ephesians, excuse me. So for those with young kids, as usual we have a Sunday
[250.30 → 254.86] school program that starts partway through the service and as well as a nursery for kids under
[254.86 → 261.64] three. So now we'd like to ask you to all stand and join in a responsive call to worship.
[261.64 → 272.60] We read in Psalm 47, clap your hands all you peoples, shout to God with loud songs of joy.
[273.60 → 279.98] For the Lord will not die by the Father's Son, and the Spirit will be for all the earth.
[279.98 → 285.16] God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
[286.12 → 292.62] Sing praises to God, sing praises, sing praises to our King, sing praises.
[293.16 → 293.94] Let us pray.
[295.28 → 302.66] Most high God, you alone are worthy of our praise. Fill this place that we may drink deeply of your
[302.66 → 308.42] Spirit. Turn our heart towards you and grant us passion for your Word and your kingdom here on
[308.42 → 313.36] earth. May the work of our hands and the words of our lips here in Ladder be a reflection of your
[313.36 → 315.76] goodness and your glory. Amen.
[317.94 → 323.70] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins to
[323.70 → 329.60] set us free from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory
[329.60 → 336.50] forever and ever. Amen. Let's take a moment to greet one another, and then we'll join in some music.
[338.42 → 368.40] Thank you.
[368.42 → 369.42] Thank you.
[369.42 → 370.42] Thank you.
[370.42 → 371.42] Thank you.
[371.42 → 373.42] Thank you.
[373.42 → 403.40] Thank you.
[403.42 → 419.42] Come all you people, come praise your maker.
[419.42 → 423.42] Come now and worship the Lord.
[423.42 → 441.42] Come all you people, come praise your Saviour.
[441.76 → 460.88] Come all you people, come this way to God.
[460.88 → 463.88] Worship the Lord.
[463.88 → 466.62] . . .
[466.62 → 487.04] . .
[487.04 → 492.14] This is my Father's Word,
[492.14 → 496.54] And oh my listening ears
[496.54 → 501.42] All nature sings and proud he rings
[501.42 → 505.86] The music of the sears
[505.86 → 510.26] This is my Father's work
[510.26 → 514.94] How I speak of life
[514.94 → 519.70] Of rocks and trees and skies and seas
[519.70 → 523.58] His hand the wanderers grow
[523.58 → 529.72] This is my Father's work
[529.72 → 534.42] The birds and carols raise
[534.42 → 539.24] The morning light, the lily-white
[539.24 → 543.66] Teamed in their baker's praise
[543.66 → 548.12] This is my Father's work
[548.12 → 552.00] He shines in hope and spirit
[552.00 → 557.24] In the rustling grass I hear him
[557.24 → 561.20] As he speaks to me everywhere
[561.20 → 568.08] This is my Father's work
[568.08 → 571.94] God let me not forget
[571.94 → 576.82] Now though their own seems of so strong
[576.82 → 581.86] God is their ruler yet
[581.86 → 586.44] This is my Father's work
[586.44 → 591.18] What should my heart be said
[591.18 → 596.02] The Lord is King and the heavens bring
[596.02 → 599.90] God reigns and the earth be glad
[599.90 → 612.98] O God, before them mountains we brought forth
[612.98 → 630.86] Lord, days of spring and summer fill the air
[630.86 → 634.74] From everlasting
[634.74 → 639.74] You are not
[639.74 → 641.62] God, before them
[641.62 → 644.74] You are not
[644.74 → 645.62] God
[645.62 → 647.74] We dwell beneath the stars
[647.74 → 650.98] In ancient stars
[650.98 → 654.06] A thousand years are nothing
[654.06 → 656.72] In your sight
[656.72 → 659.62] From everlasting
[659.62 → 664.86] You are God
[664.86 → 665.86] God
[665.86 → 672.84] And all our days are held within your hands
[672.84 → 675.86] Your prophet, love and favour
[675.86 → 679.02] At no end
[679.02 → 684.74] We rest within the wisdom of your prayer
[684.74 → 687.66] Everlasting
[687.66 → 689.98] God
[689.98 → 690.94] God
[690.94 → 701.66] Oh God
[701.66 → 701.88] Oh God
[701.88 → 703.14] Oh God
[703.14 → 715.66] Oh God
[715.66 → 720.48] You are God
[720.48 → 727.54] And all our days are held within your hands
[727.54 → 733.60] Your proudest love and favour are no end
[733.60 → 739.22] We rest within the wisdom of your blood
[739.22 → 744.54] Everlasting God
[744.54 → 760.30] O God of light, our ways are known to you
[760.30 → 766.30] By your grace, you're making all things new
[766.30 → 772.30] So satisfy us in the number of days
[772.30 → 778.36] Establish every effort while we bring
[778.36 → 786.06] Forever lasting, you are God
[786.06 → 794.12] And all our days are held within your hands
[794.12 → 799.82] Your perfect love and favour are no end
[799.82 → 805.88] We rest within the wisdom of your blood
[805.88 → 807.88] Everlasting
[807.88 → 814.58] And all our days are held within your hands
[814.58 → 820.88] Your perfect love and favour are no end
[820.88 → 826.94] We rest within the wisdom of your blood
[826.94 → 832.68] Everlasting blood
[832.68 → 837.56] You may be seated
[837.56 → 851.16] People of God, our world can be a wearisome place
[851.16 → 853.10] And there is a temptation to give up
[853.10 → 854.60] To harden our hearts
[854.60 → 855.96] To turn off the news
[855.96 → 858.18] And to pretend it doesn't exist
[858.18 → 860.22] We are told by the world
[860.22 → 863.56] That we need to learn to simply care less
[863.56 → 867.42] It is not to say that the world wants us to be evil
[867.42 → 869.50] Just that evil is inevitable
[869.50 → 873.08] And that crying about it won't do any good
[873.08 → 875.62] Death happens to everyone eventually
[875.62 → 876.72] And it's finite
[876.72 → 878.94] So we might as well get used to it
[878.94 → 882.64] At the time when Jesus was alive
[882.64 → 884.96] The greatest philosopher in the Roman world
[884.96 → 886.70] Was a man named Seneca
[886.70 → 889.62] Seneca was a practitioner of the philosophy
[889.62 → 890.98] Called Stoicism
[890.98 → 893.20] Stoics believed that
[893.20 → 895.40] The most important thing we can do in life
[895.40 → 897.36] Is to become the master of our emotions
[897.36 → 900.66] Not only emotions like jealousy or anger
[900.66 → 902.40] But all emotions
[902.40 → 906.04] Declaring that grief should either not be given a place
[906.04 → 907.12] In the soul at all
[907.12 → 909.52] Or should be driven out
[909.52 → 912.68] It was said that the ultimate goal of the Stoic
[912.68 → 914.86] Was to have such a mastery over their emotion
[914.86 → 916.86] That they would not shed a tear
[916.86 → 919.02] At the death of their child
[919.02 → 921.28] Or the funeral of their best friend
[921.28 → 924.74] The world offers us little comfort
[924.74 → 925.72] Seneca believed
[925.72 → 928.58] That it was up to us to train ourselves
[928.58 → 931.62] To be resilient and beyond the power of emotions
[931.62 → 933.26] He asked his followers
[933.26 → 934.66] What harm is it
[934.66 → 937.24] Just when you're kissing your little child
[937.24 → 937.96] To say
[937.96 → 940.12] Tomorrow you will die
[940.12 → 944.74] Even in our atheistic society
[944.74 → 946.10] That sounds appalling
[946.10 → 948.30] But without God at the centre
[948.30 → 950.06] The world is cold
[950.06 → 951.72] And transactional
[951.72 → 953.92] Tears have no value
[953.92 → 955.72] And they simply get in the way
[955.72 → 958.06] A world without a loving
[958.06 → 959.08] Caring God
[959.08 → 961.90] Means that we are our only defence
[961.90 → 964.20] Against sorrow and death
[964.20 → 967.20] Jesus of course
[967.20 → 968.98] Offers a different picture
[968.98 → 970.32] Remember
[970.32 → 971.54] Jesus and Seneca
[971.54 → 972.68] Were contemporaries
[972.68 → 974.90] They lived at the exact same time
[974.90 → 976.60] In the same Roman Empire
[976.60 → 978.12] And through the apostles
[978.12 → 979.32] Their messages
[979.32 → 980.60] Were likely heard
[980.60 → 982.20] By the exact same audiences
[982.20 → 983.28] Indeed
[983.28 → 984.46] Seneca's was probably
[984.46 → 986.22] The more mainstream of the two
[986.22 → 988.18] And with that as a background
[988.18 → 990.20] Imagine hearing the gospel
[990.20 → 990.90] Of John
[990.90 → 991.90] For the first time
[991.90 → 994.80] Now Jesus had not yet
[994.80 → 995.64] Entered the village
[995.64 → 997.44] But there was still a place
[997.44 → 998.68] Where Martha had met him
[998.68 → 1000.12] When the Jews
[1000.12 → 1001.14] Who had been with Mary
[1001.14 → 1001.78] In the house
[1001.78 → 1002.52] Comforting her
[1002.52 → 1003.56] Noticed how quickly
[1003.56 → 1004.70] She got up and went out
[1004.70 → 1005.96] They followed her
[1005.96 → 1007.44] Supposing she was going
[1007.44 → 1008.08] To the tomb
[1008.08 → 1009.08] To mourn there
[1009.08 → 1011.48] When Mary reached the place
[1011.48 → 1012.44] Where Jesus was
[1012.44 → 1013.48] And saw him
[1013.48 → 1015.10] She fell at his feet
[1015.10 → 1015.92] And said Lord
[1015.92 → 1017.38] If you had been here
[1017.38 → 1018.10] My brother
[1018.10 → 1019.52] Would not have died
[1019.52 → 1022.26] When Jesus saw her weeping
[1022.26 → 1023.64] And the Jews
[1023.64 → 1024.32] Who had come along
[1024.32 → 1025.40] With her also weeping
[1025.40 → 1027.38] He was deeply moved
[1027.38 → 1028.72] In spirit
[1028.72 → 1029.62] And troubled
[1029.62 → 1032.00] Where have you laid him?
[1032.30 → 1032.92] He asked
[1032.92 → 1034.96] Come and see Lord
[1034.96 → 1035.72] They replied
[1035.72 → 1038.16] Jesus wept
[1038.16 → 1041.60] Then the Jews said
[1041.60 → 1044.20] See how he loved him
[1044.20 → 1047.12] I don't think you will find
[1047.12 → 1048.28] Many people advocating
[1048.28 → 1049.44] For holding back tears
[1049.44 → 1050.90] At the funeral of a loved one
[1050.90 → 1051.52] These days
[1051.52 → 1052.92] But our world
[1052.92 → 1054.62] Is still strongly influenced
[1054.62 → 1055.46] By the Stoics
[1055.46 → 1056.84] We are warned
[1056.84 → 1058.00] That becoming too invested
[1058.00 → 1058.76] In other people
[1058.76 → 1060.26] Will lead to burnout
[1060.26 → 1062.08] We'll be overwhelmed
[1062.08 → 1062.98] By a feeling
[1062.98 → 1064.14] Of helplessness
[1064.14 → 1065.94] So then
[1065.94 → 1067.32] Let us come before our God
[1067.32 → 1068.66] And ask for wisdom
[1068.66 → 1069.80] Let's pray
[1069.80 → 1072.28] Heavenly Father
[1072.28 → 1072.78] Father
[1072.78 → 1073.44] We are eager
[1073.44 → 1074.66] To wall ourselves off
[1074.66 → 1075.46] From the grief
[1075.46 → 1076.12] And sadness
[1076.12 → 1076.76] Of the world
[1076.76 → 1078.64] We hide our face
[1078.64 → 1079.40] From the suffering
[1079.40 → 1081.56] We prefer to ignore sin
[1081.56 → 1083.38] And try not to think of it
[1083.38 → 1085.32] But you oh Lord
[1085.32 → 1086.40] Are a compassionate
[1086.40 → 1087.74] Suffering
[1087.74 → 1088.86] Servant king
[1088.86 → 1090.58] Sacrificing yourself
[1090.58 → 1091.66] To death on a cross
[1091.66 → 1092.66] To heal
[1092.66 → 1093.62] The suffering
[1093.62 → 1094.48] Of the world
[1094.48 → 1096.48] Help us to walk
[1096.48 → 1097.18] In your footsteps
[1097.18 → 1099.00] And to serve others
[1099.00 → 1099.92] As you serve
[1099.92 → 1101.86] Grieve with others
[1101.86 → 1102.92] As you grieve
[1102.92 → 1103.52] With them
[1103.52 → 1105.10] Teach us to be
[1105.10 → 1106.14] Outspoken critics
[1106.14 → 1107.46] Of hate and violence
[1107.46 → 1109.52] Rather than turning away
[1109.52 → 1109.92] From it
[1109.92 → 1110.90] And ignoring it
[1110.90 → 1112.42] May we come
[1112.42 → 1113.58] Alongside our neighbour
[1113.58 → 1114.74] And grieve with them
[1114.74 → 1116.38] And suffer alongside them
[1116.38 → 1117.60] Help us to be
[1117.60 → 1118.60] A light of the nations
[1118.60 → 1119.80] A reflection
[1119.80 → 1121.56] Of your steadfast love
[1121.56 → 1124.00] We ask for new hearts
[1124.00 → 1124.96] And new spirits
[1124.96 → 1126.72] Remove from us
[1126.72 → 1128.04] Our hearts of stone
[1128.04 → 1129.28] And give us
[1129.28 → 1130.92] Hearts of flesh
[1130.92 → 1132.88] We pray this all
[1132.88 → 1133.78] In Jesus name
[1133.78 → 1134.96] Amen
[1134.96 → 1138.04] Congregation
[1138.04 → 1139.16] Our hearts of stone
[1139.16 → 1140.44] Cannot save us
[1140.44 → 1142.24] We cannot be
[1142.24 → 1143.40] Our own refuge
[1143.40 → 1145.38] But our God
[1145.38 → 1146.42] Is for us
[1146.42 → 1147.50] No
[1147.50 → 1148.82] He does not promise
[1148.82 → 1150.22] Our lives will be easy
[1150.22 → 1151.38] In a moment
[1151.38 → 1152.62] We'll be singing
[1152.62 → 1153.62] In fact
[1153.62 → 1155.64] Of walking through the valley
[1155.64 → 1156.92] Of the shadow of death
[1156.92 → 1158.58] Of the impending battle
[1158.58 → 1160.24] And of the night
[1160.24 → 1162.98] But then we also sing
[1162.98 → 1164.08] Of our God
[1164.08 → 1165.30] Who will go before us
[1165.30 → 1166.30] And lead the way
[1166.30 → 1168.30] That he is our refuge
[1168.30 → 1170.50] And only he can save
[1170.50 → 1171.82] Let us sing
[1171.82 → 1173.66] Our God is for us
[1173.66 → 1187.20] We will fear the battle
[1187.20 → 1189.44] We will fear the night
[1189.44 → 1192.04] We will walk the valley
[1192.04 → 1194.42] With you by the side
[1194.42 → 1197.24] You will go before us
[1197.24 → 1199.16] We will lead the way
[1199.16 → 1201.54] We will find the refuge
[1201.54 → 1201.60] We will find the refuge
[1201.60 → 1204.48] Only you can save
[1204.48 → 1206.22] Sing
[1206.22 → 1208.08] We will turn up
[1208.08 → 1210.42] Our God is for us
[1210.42 → 1213.18] The Father's love is a strong
[1213.18 → 1214.70] And mighty fortress
[1214.70 → 1217.58] Raise your voice now
[1217.58 → 1219.44] Our love is great
[1219.44 → 1221.78] Who can stand against us
[1221.78 → 1225.36] If our God is for us
[1225.36 → 1235.94] Even when I stumble
[1235.94 → 1238.26] Even when I fall
[1238.26 → 1241.16] Even when I turn back
[1241.16 → 1243.12] Still you'll not be sure
[1243.12 → 1245.56] You will not abandon
[1245.56 → 1248.10] You will go for safe
[1248.10 → 1250.30] You will cheer me on
[1250.30 → 1253.24] Our endeavour and the embrace
[1253.24 → 1256.76] Sing with joy now
[1256.76 → 1259.10] Our God is for us
[1259.10 → 1261.88] The Father's love is a strong
[1261.88 → 1263.34] And mighty fortress
[1263.34 → 1266.24] Raise your voice now
[1266.24 → 1268.14] Your love is great
[1268.14 → 1270.44] Who can stand against us
[1270.44 → 1274.44] If our God is for us
[1274.44 → 1284.24] Neither high nor death
[1284.24 → 1287.12] Can separate us
[1287.12 → 1289.02] Hell and death
[1289.02 → 1291.90] Will not defeat us
[1291.90 → 1296.38] He who gave his Son to free us
[1296.38 → 1300.18] Mostly in his love
[1300.18 → 1302.86] Neither high nor death
[1302.86 → 1305.86] Can separate us
[1305.86 → 1307.64] Hell and death
[1307.64 → 1310.54] Will not defeat us
[1310.54 → 1315.00] He who gave his Son to free us
[1315.00 → 1319.26] Holds me in his love
[1319.26 → 1324.30] Sing with joy now
[1324.30 → 1326.66] Our God is for us
[1326.66 → 1329.34] The Father's love is a strong
[1329.34 → 1330.80] And mighty fortress
[1330.80 → 1333.58] Raise your voice now
[1333.58 → 1335.50] Your love is greater
[1335.50 → 1337.72] Who can stand against us
[1337.72 → 1340.68] If our God is for us
[1340.68 → 1342.96] Sing with joy now
[1342.96 → 1345.24] Our God is for us
[1345.24 → 1348.00] The Father's love is a strong
[1348.00 → 1349.50] And mighty fortress
[1349.50 → 1352.36] Raise your voice now
[1352.36 → 1353.66] Your love is greater
[1353.66 → 1356.50] Who can stand against us
[1356.50 → 1359.66] If our God is for us
[1359.66 → 1380.66] At this point, the kids ages 3 through grade 3
[1380.66 → 1382.40] Can head off to kids' life
[1382.40 → 1384.06] To continuing worshipping our God
[1384.06 → 1385.76] In the way they do best
[1385.76 → 1387.92] Be blessed as you go
[1387.92 → 1390.36] And as the kids head off to worship
[1390.36 → 1391.50] I would like to invite up
[1391.50 → 1392.68] Pastor Theo Lauder
[1392.68 → 1394.88] To bring us God's word from the pulpit
[1394.88 → 1396.96] Pastor Theo has preached for us
[1396.96 → 1398.18] A number of times in the past
[1398.18 → 1400.46] And previously from Servants Anonymous
[1400.46 → 1402.74] Theo is currently executive director
[1402.74 → 1404.74] At Life Renewal
[1404.74 → 1406.28] Which is a biblical support program
[1406.28 → 1407.86] That offers a confidential
[1407.86 → 1408.94] Supportive community
[1408.94 → 1410.24] And it's a place to share
[1410.24 → 1411.38] And to pray
[1411.38 → 1412.78] And to encourage one another
[1412.78 → 1413.64] So Pastor Theo
[1413.64 → 1414.84] I'd like to invite you out
[1414.84 → 1421.98] Thank you, God bless him
[1421.98 → 1430.12] Well it's very good to be with you
[1430.12 → 1430.98] Again this morning
[1430.98 → 1433.34] And to worship our God together
[1433.34 → 1435.88] God is so good
[1435.88 → 1438.58] And it's good that we can sing to him
[1438.58 → 1441.02] And that we can also have fellowship
[1441.02 → 1441.86] With one another
[1441.86 → 1446.62] And yeah as I was also reading in your bulletin
[1446.62 → 1449.62] You're soon celebrating your 75th anniversary
[1449.62 → 1450.70] As a congregation
[1450.70 → 1452.94] I want to congratulate you on that
[1452.94 → 1455.52] And I think God's word
[1455.52 → 1457.54] Also in Ephesians 6
[1457.54 → 1460.30] Has so much to say to a church
[1460.30 → 1462.44] At the juncture that you are
[1462.44 → 1463.22] As well
[1463.22 → 1465.26] As it has for all of us
[1465.26 → 1466.14] And, so I
[1466.14 → 1468.50] I'm just delighted to bring
[1468.50 → 1470.00] God's word to you this morning
[1470.00 → 1472.10] From Ephesians chapter 6
[1472.10 → 1474.36] Where we read about the armour of God
[1474.36 → 1475.72] But we'll first read
[1475.72 → 1478.20] A related passage in the Old Testament
[1478.20 → 1480.02] Psalm 144
[1480.02 → 1488.44] Psalm 144
[1488.44 → 1496.08] Not in your pew bibles
[1496.08 → 1498.42] That's on page 469
[1498.42 → 1503.88] And here we read the word of God
[1503.88 → 1505.36] Which is also the word of Christ
[1505.36 → 1510.18] I was recently at an exam of a minister
[1510.18 → 1513.16] And of a candidate who was to become minister
[1513.16 → 1513.92] And he was asked
[1513.92 → 1515.46] Which are the messianic psalms
[1515.46 → 1517.28] And it was supposed to be a trick question
[1517.28 → 1520.74] And then he started listing
[1520.74 → 1522.20] All the messianic psalms
[1522.20 → 1524.40] And the person questioning him said
[1524.40 → 1526.56] Well actually it's all the psalms
[1526.56 → 1528.42] Because really all the psalms
[1528.42 → 1529.54] Speak of Christ
[1529.54 → 1531.62] And so we all had a good laugh
[1531.62 → 1533.22] But also this psalm
[1533.22 → 1535.04] As we'll see this morning
[1535.04 → 1535.86] Is
[1535.86 → 1538.20] It points us to Christ
[1538.20 → 1540.64] And Christ the word made flesh
[1540.64 → 1543.02] Is the fulfillment of this psalm
[1543.02 → 1545.46] Psalm of David
[1545.46 → 1547.62] Praise be to the Lord my rock
[1547.62 → 1550.46] Who trains my hands for war
[1550.46 → 1552.30] My fingers for battle
[1552.30 → 1554.80] He is my loving God
[1554.80 → 1555.88] And my fortress
[1555.88 → 1557.28] My stronghold
[1557.28 → 1558.64] And my deliverer
[1558.64 → 1561.22] My shield in whom I take refuge
[1561.22 → 1563.92] Who subdues peoples under me
[1563.92 → 1565.90] O Lord
[1565.90 → 1568.12] What is man that you care for him
[1568.12 → 1570.74] The son of man that you think of him
[1570.74 → 1572.60] Man is like a breath
[1572.60 → 1575.78] His days are like a fleeting shadow
[1575.78 → 1578.56] Part your heavens O Lord
[1578.56 → 1579.60] And come down
[1579.60 → 1581.34] Touch the mountains
[1581.34 → 1582.92] So that they smoke
[1582.92 → 1584.86] Send forth lightning
[1584.86 → 1586.80] And scatter the enemies
[1586.80 → 1589.20] Shoot your arrows and rout them
[1589.20 → 1592.34] Reach down your hand from on high
[1592.34 → 1594.40] Deliver me
[1594.40 → 1595.66] And rescue me
[1595.66 → 1597.10] From the mighty waters
[1597.10 → 1599.16] From the hands of foreigners
[1599.16 → 1601.14] Whose mouths are full of lies
[1601.14 → 1603.96] Whose right hands are deceitful
[1603.96 → 1607.46] I will sing a new song to you O God
[1607.46 → 1609.28] On the ten-string lyre
[1609.28 → 1610.64] I will make music to you
[1610.64 → 1612.88] To the one who gives victory to kings
[1612.88 → 1614.88] Who delivers his servant David
[1614.88 → 1616.32] From the deadly sword
[1616.32 → 1618.32] Deliver me
[1618.32 → 1619.76] And rescue me
[1619.76 → 1621.46] From the hands of foreigners
[1621.46 → 1623.82] Whose mouths are full of lies
[1623.82 → 1626.94] Whose right hands are deceitful
[1626.94 → 1629.20] Then our sons and their youth
[1629.20 → 1631.24] Will be like well-nurtured plants
[1631.24 → 1632.26] And our daughters
[1632.26 → 1633.54] Will be like pillars
[1633.54 → 1635.32] Carved to adorn a palace
[1635.32 → 1637.32] Our barns will be filled
[1637.32 → 1638.84] With every kind of provision
[1638.84 → 1641.62] Our sheep will increase by thousands
[1641.62 → 1644.12] By tens of thousands in our fields
[1644.12 → 1647.42] Our oxen will draw heavy loads
[1647.42 → 1649.96] There will be no breaching of walls
[1649.96 → 1651.86] No going into captivity
[1651.86 → 1653.80] No cry of distress
[1653.80 → 1655.36] In our streets
[1655.36 → 1658.02] Blessed are the people
[1658.02 → 1659.30] Of whom this is true
[1659.30 → 1661.28] Blessed are the people
[1661.28 → 1663.78] Whose God is the Lord
[1663.78 → 1671.00] And that is indeed fulfilled
[1671.00 → 1672.48] In our Lord Jesus Christ
[1672.48 → 1675.26] Who as we know from the New Testament
[1675.26 → 1678.82] And as it was clear also
[1678.82 → 1681.52] In the words that Ryan spoke to us earlier
[1681.52 → 1684.46] He is the one who rescues us
[1684.46 → 1685.72] He is the one who delivers us
[1685.72 → 1687.70] He is the one who brings justice
[1687.70 → 1691.14] He is the one who comforts us
[1691.14 → 1692.58] Who sustains us
[1692.58 → 1696.52] And who also equips us
[1696.52 → 1698.68] For the spiritual battle
[1698.68 → 1699.90] That we all face
[1699.90 → 1702.98] So we turn this morning
[1702.98 → 1705.32] And give our particular attention
[1705.32 → 1706.62] To Paul's letter
[1706.62 → 1708.40] To the Ephesians chapter 6
[1708.40 → 1709.38] Where we see that
[1709.38 → 1713.36] And in your pew bibles
[1713.36 → 1716.44] That is on page 872
[1716.44 → 1723.14] Where the apostle Paul writes
[1723.14 → 1726.30] Finally be strong in the Lord
[1726.30 → 1728.46] And in his mighty power
[1728.46 → 1732.16] Put on the full armour of God
[1732.16 → 1735.22] So that you can take your stand
[1735.22 → 1736.76] Against the devil's schemes
[1736.76 → 1740.90] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood
[1740.90 → 1742.86] But against the rulers
[1742.86 → 1744.62] Against the authorities
[1744.62 → 1747.72] Against the powers of this dark world
[1747.72 → 1750.52] And against the spiritual forces of evil
[1750.52 → 1752.18] In the heavenly realms
[1752.18 → 1755.42] Therefore put on the full armour of God
[1755.42 → 1757.72] So that when the day of evil comes
[1757.72 → 1760.34] You may be able to stand your ground
[1760.34 → 1762.58] And after you have done everything
[1762.58 → 1763.84] To stand
[1763.84 → 1767.06] Stand firm then with the belt of truth
[1767.06 → 1768.80] Buckled around your waist
[1768.80 → 1771.48] With the breastplate of righteousness in place
[1771.48 → 1773.78] And with your feet fitted
[1773.78 → 1775.82] With the readiness that comes
[1775.82 → 1777.14] From the gospel of peace
[1777.14 → 1779.60] In addition to all this
[1779.60 → 1781.04] Take up the shield of faith
[1781.04 → 1782.96] With which you can extinguish
[1782.96 → 1785.20] All the flaming arrows of the evil one
[1785.20 → 1787.84] Take the helmet of salvation
[1787.84 → 1789.84] And the sword of the spirit
[1789.84 → 1791.70] Which is the word of God
[1791.70 → 1794.98] And pray in the spirit on all occasions
[1794.98 → 1797.64] With all kinds of prayers and requests
[1797.64 → 1799.24] With this in mind
[1799.24 → 1801.88] Be alert and always keep on praying
[1801.88 → 1803.04] For all the saints
[1803.04 → 1805.42] Pray also for me
[1805.42 → 1807.72] That whenever I open my mouth
[1807.72 → 1809.26] Words may be given me
[1809.26 → 1811.30] So that I will fearlessly make known
[1811.30 → 1812.42] The mystery of the gospel
[1812.42 → 1815.16] For which I am an ambassador in chains
[1815.16 → 1818.24] Pray that I may declare it fearlessly
[1818.24 → 1819.86] As I should
[1819.86 → 1822.52] Tactics the dear brother
[1822.52 → 1823.94] And faithful servant in the Lord
[1823.94 → 1824.80] Will tell you everything
[1824.80 → 1826.24] So that you also may know
[1826.24 → 1827.68] How I am
[1827.68 → 1829.10] And what I am doing
[1829.10 → 1831.18] I am sending him to you
[1831.18 → 1832.22] For this very purpose
[1832.22 → 1833.98] That you may know how we are
[1833.98 → 1836.02] And that he may encourage you
[1836.02 → 1839.44] Peace to the brothers and sisters
[1839.44 → 1841.80] And love with faith
[1841.80 → 1843.04] From God the Father
[1843.04 → 1844.92] And the Lord Jesus Christ
[1844.92 → 1847.62] Grace to all who die
[1847.62 → 1850.34] Who love our Lord Jesus Christ
[1850.34 → 1853.28] With an undying love
[1853.28 → 1855.60] Grass withers and the flowers fall
[1855.60 → 1857.54] But the word of our God stands forever
[1857.54 → 1858.42] And this is the word
[1858.42 → 1860.02] That I may preach to you
[1860.02 → 1865.30] Ephesians 6 verses 10 through 20
[1865.30 → 1867.72] Fits remarkably well
[1867.72 → 1869.02] Into the plot line
[1869.02 → 1870.72] Of all scripture
[1870.72 → 1871.58] Doesn't it?
[1872.48 → 1873.34] It fits perfectly
[1873.34 → 1874.50] Into the plot line
[1874.50 → 1876.66] Of Jesus' ministry
[1876.66 → 1878.14] As that is dramatically
[1878.14 → 1879.74] Laid out in the gospels
[1879.74 → 1881.98] And it fits seamlessly
[1881.98 → 1883.94] With the rest of Paul's letter
[1883.94 → 1885.66] Here to the Ephesians
[1885.66 → 1888.98] Now you may be thinking to yourself
[1888.98 → 1889.88] I don't want to
[1889.88 → 1891.54] You know presume
[1891.54 → 1893.30] But you may be thinking to yourself
[1893.30 → 1894.44] Why
[1894.44 → 1896.68] Is the preacher
[1896.68 → 1898.76] Stating what should be obvious
[1898.76 → 1900.44] To anyone who believes
[1900.44 → 1901.76] That the Bible is inspired
[1901.76 → 1902.76] By the Holy Spirit
[1902.76 → 1905.28] Infallible and authoritative
[1905.28 → 1906.68] The very word of God
[1906.68 → 1909.72] Wouldn't it be seamless?
[1910.98 → 1912.06] Shouldn't we expect
[1912.06 → 1914.38] Ephesians 6 to fit in perfectly
[1914.38 → 1916.22] With not only Paul's letter
[1916.22 → 1917.84] But with all scripture?
[1919.32 → 1920.48] Well let me tell you
[1920.48 → 1921.78] Why I think the obvious
[1921.78 → 1922.84] Deserves repeating
[1922.84 → 1924.64] In relation to the armour of God
[1924.64 → 1926.64] Here in Ephesians 6
[1926.64 → 1929.98] Often Ephesians 6
[1929.98 → 1931.40] The verses 10 through 20
[1931.40 → 1933.98] Is abstracted from its
[1933.98 → 1935.88] Wider biblical context
[1935.88 → 1939.50] It's a go-to passage
[1939.50 → 1940.70] So to speak
[1940.70 → 1941.38] On spiritual warfare
[1941.94 → 1942.88] People are talking about
[1942.88 → 1944.52] Spiritual warfare
[1944.52 → 1945.02] And we think
[1945.02 → 1945.44] Oh yeah
[1945.44 → 1947.72] Remember Paul talks about
[1947.72 → 1949.14] The armour of God
[1949.14 → 1951.22] Where is that Bible passage now?
[1952.84 → 1956.02] But often this wider context
[1956.02 → 1957.38] Goes unnoticed
[1957.38 → 1959.72] Is ignored or forgotten
[1959.72 → 1962.28] As a result
[1962.28 → 1963.42] The depth
[1963.42 → 1964.26] The breadth
[1964.26 → 1965.42] And the sweeping power
[1965.42 → 1966.92] Of what the Spirit reveals here
[1966.92 → 1969.08] Is lost on readers
[1969.08 → 1970.46] It's lost on us
[1970.46 → 1972.18] If we're not aware
[1972.18 → 1972.68] Of that
[1972.68 → 1975.24] Broader picture
[1975.24 → 1978.84] So let's think about this
[1978.84 → 1981.02] For a few minutes
[1981.02 → 1981.62] This morning
[1981.62 → 1983.76] Consider first
[1983.76 → 1984.74] The plot line
[1984.74 → 1985.74] Of scripture
[1985.74 → 1988.56] There's a huge
[1988.56 → 1989.62] Conflict
[1989.62 → 1991.18] Going on
[1991.18 → 1992.80] One that we're
[1992.80 → 1994.14] Introduced to
[1994.14 → 1994.64] Already
[1994.64 → 1995.82] Early in Genesis
[1995.82 → 1997.60] And this plot line
[1997.60 → 1998.48] Of conflict
[1998.48 → 1999.38] Runs through
[1999.38 → 2000.04] All scripture
[2000.04 → 2002.80] It's a conflict
[2002.80 → 2003.94] Of Satan
[2003.94 → 2005.32] The great adversary
[2005.32 → 2008.28] Against the Lord God
[2008.28 → 2011.30] It begins
[2011.30 → 2012.30] In the Garden of Eden
[2012.30 → 2013.42] Where Satan
[2013.42 → 2014.94] Tempts Adam and Eve
[2014.94 → 2016.42] To reject God
[2016.42 → 2017.08] And to doubt
[2017.08 → 2018.06] His word
[2018.06 → 2021.00] Did God
[2021.00 → 2021.84] Really say?
[2021.84 → 2026.26] You will not
[2026.26 → 2027.04] Surely die
[2027.04 → 2031.70] The whole plot line
[2031.70 → 2032.22] Of the Bible
[2032.22 → 2033.70] Is punctuated
[2033.70 → 2034.86] By this
[2034.86 → 2036.22] Cosmic conflict
[2036.22 → 2037.36] It begins
[2037.36 → 2037.92] In Genesis
[2037.92 → 2038.74] But then it runs
[2038.74 → 2039.78] All the way through
[2039.78 → 2043.38] Can and Abel
[2043.38 → 2046.86] Babel
[2046.86 → 2048.44] Against the people
[2048.44 → 2049.02] Of God
[2049.02 → 2050.96] And then there's
[2050.96 → 2051.42] Pharaoh
[2051.42 → 2053.64] Against Moses
[2053.64 → 2056.28] Goliath
[2056.28 → 2058.78] Against that
[2058.78 → 2059.56] Puny
[2059.56 → 2060.46] Teenager
[2060.46 → 2061.40] David
[2061.40 → 2063.76] Babylon
[2063.76 → 2065.32] Against Jerusalem
[2065.32 → 2067.34] Herod
[2067.34 → 2068.20] Against the infant
[2068.20 → 2068.62] Jesus
[2068.62 → 2069.26] As we enter
[2069.26 → 2070.08] The New Testament
[2070.08 → 2072.60] The Pharisees
[2072.60 → 2073.28] Against Jesus
[2073.28 → 2074.54] Earthly ministry
[2074.54 → 2077.38] Then remember
[2077.38 → 2077.74] Jesus'
[2077.74 → 2078.96] Programmatic
[2078.96 → 2079.50] Statement
[2079.50 → 2080.70] In Matthew 16
[2080.70 → 2081.48] Verse 18
[2081.48 → 2083.08] I will build
[2083.08 → 2083.78] My church
[2083.78 → 2084.44] And the gates
[2084.44 → 2085.00] Of hell
[2085.00 → 2085.86] Shall not
[2085.86 → 2087.02] Prevail against us
[2087.02 → 2087.74] There the line
[2087.74 → 2088.42] Of the conflict
[2088.42 → 2089.70] Is drawn very
[2089.70 → 2091.24] Clearly and plainly
[2091.24 → 2094.44] I will build
[2094.44 → 2095.24] My church
[2095.24 → 2096.66] Jesus is basically
[2096.66 → 2097.14] Saying
[2097.14 → 2099.04] In enemy
[2099.04 → 2100.36] Occupied
[2100.36 → 2101.40] Territory
[2101.40 → 2105.56] And it continues
[2105.56 → 2106.62] In the early pages
[2106.62 → 2107.62] Of the Acts
[2107.62 → 2108.32] Of the apostles
[2108.32 → 2109.10] Where Satan
[2109.10 → 2110.44] Continues to use
[2110.44 → 2111.30] His characteristic
[2111.30 → 2112.26] Strategies
[2112.26 → 2113.76] Of intimidation
[2113.76 → 2115.34] Persecution
[2115.34 → 2116.12] Deception
[2116.12 → 2117.06] Division
[2117.06 → 2119.02] And that against
[2119.02 → 2119.80] All odds
[2119.80 → 2120.84] That actually
[2120.84 → 2122.36] Spawns the
[2122.36 → 2123.48] Massive
[2123.48 → 2124.30] Explosion
[2124.30 → 2125.60] Of the church
[2125.60 → 2128.18] And then
[2128.18 → 2129.82] The book of
[2129.82 → 2130.32] Revelation
[2130.32 → 2132.94] Which is sometimes
[2132.94 → 2133.50] Referred to
[2133.50 → 2134.86] As the movie
[2134.86 → 2135.28] Version
[2135.28 → 2136.48] Of this great
[2136.48 → 2137.30] Conflict
[2137.30 → 2139.24] Where this
[2139.24 → 2139.78] Cosmic
[2139.78 → 2140.24] Spiritual
[2140.24 → 2140.94] Conflict
[2140.94 → 2141.48] Comes to a
[2141.48 → 2141.88] Dramatic
[2141.88 → 2142.30] Head
[2142.30 → 2142.48] And
[2142.48 → 2143.48] Consummation
[2143.48 → 2149.30] So Ephesians
[2149.30 → 2150.24] Really fits
[2150.24 → 2150.86] Right into
[2150.86 → 2151.80] That central
[2151.80 → 2152.78] Potline
[2152.78 → 2153.72] Of scripture
[2153.72 → 2155.54] Exhorting us
[2155.54 → 2156.64] To be strong
[2156.64 → 2157.46] In the Lord
[2157.46 → 2159.08] To make sure
[2159.08 → 2159.78] That we're
[2159.78 → 2160.48] On the right
[2160.48 → 2161.02] Side
[2161.02 → 2161.74] Of this
[2161.74 → 2162.44] Cosmic
[2162.44 → 2163.56] Conflict
[2163.56 → 2164.98] Since the
[2164.98 → 2165.44] Beginning of
[2165.44 → 2165.78] Time
[2165.78 → 2168.10] And in order
[2168.10 → 2168.74] To do that
[2168.74 → 2170.44] We need to
[2170.44 → 2171.04] Clothe
[2171.04 → 2171.88] Ourselves
[2171.88 → 2172.74] With the
[2172.74 → 2173.16] Whole
[2173.16 → 2173.94] Armour
[2173.94 → 2175.40] Of God
[2175.40 → 2180.34] And that's
[2180.34 → 2181.06] Why Paul
[2181.06 → 2182.26] Lays it out
[2182.26 → 2182.70] For us
[2182.70 → 2182.98] Here
[2182.98 → 2188.82] And we're
[2188.82 → 2189.16] Not going to
[2189.16 → 2189.74] Have time to
[2189.74 → 2190.20] Go through
[2190.20 → 2191.06] Each of the
[2191.06 → 2191.56] Parts of
[2191.56 → 2191.92] Armour
[2191.92 → 2193.60] That's really
[2193.60 → 2194.24] Something that
[2194.24 → 2195.60] Could be
[2195.60 → 2196.30] Explored through
[2196.30 → 2197.24] Quite a number
[2197.24 → 2198.00] Of sermons
[2198.00 → 2198.62] Actually
[2198.62 → 2201.86] But I think
[2201.86 → 2202.40] It's important
[2202.40 → 2203.34] That we have
[2203.34 → 2203.90] This
[2203.90 → 2205.22] Context
[2205.22 → 2205.90] Before we
[2205.90 → 2206.80] Really understand
[2206.80 → 2207.18] What
[2207.18 → 2208.38] What is this
[2208.38 → 2209.04] Armour for
[2209.04 → 2209.64] What good
[2209.64 → 2210.36] Will it do
[2210.36 → 2211.36] And why do
[2211.36 → 2212.10] I need to
[2212.10 → 2212.74] Put it on
[2212.74 → 2214.32] And why do
[2214.32 → 2215.38] We as church
[2215.38 → 2216.12] Need to
[2216.12 → 2217.16] Put on
[2217.16 → 2217.90] This armour
[2217.90 → 2222.54] It also
[2222.54 → 2222.86] Fits
[2222.86 → 2223.18] Therefore
[2223.18 → 2223.58] As I
[2223.58 → 2223.80] Already
[2223.80 → 2224.56] Suggested
[2224.56 → 2225.42] In the
[2225.42 → 2225.90] Potline
[2225.90 → 2226.42] Of Jesus
[2226.42 → 2227.32] Ministry
[2227.32 → 2228.10] Both his
[2228.10 → 2228.68] Earthly
[2228.68 → 2229.50] Ministry
[2229.50 → 2229.84] And the
[2229.84 → 2230.64] Ministry
[2230.64 → 2231.10] Which he
[2231.10 → 2231.62] Continues
[2231.62 → 2232.42] From heaven
[2232.42 → 2233.44] Because remember
[2233.44 → 2234.02] Even though
[2234.02 → 2234.74] He's not
[2234.74 → 2235.42] Here on
[2235.42 → 2235.74] Earth
[2235.74 → 2236.28] Anymore
[2236.28 → 2238.50] Like he
[2238.50 → 2239.04] Was in
[2239.04 → 2239.62] In
[2239.62 → 2241.10] The
[2241.10 → 2241.72] Bible
[2241.72 → 2242.26] Passage
[2242.26 → 2242.78] That Ryan
[2242.78 → 2243.26] Referred to
[2243.26 → 2243.64] Earlier
[2243.64 → 2244.42] John 10
[2244.42 → 2245.58] With Martha
[2245.58 → 2246.54] And Mary
[2246.54 → 2247.68] After the
[2247.68 → 2248.10] Death of
[2248.10 → 2248.94] Lazarus
[2248.94 → 2251.34] But he's
[2251.34 → 2252.00] Continuing his
[2252.00 → 2252.42] Ministry
[2252.42 → 2253.02] From his
[2253.02 → 2253.46] Throne
[2253.46 → 2254.08] In heaven
[2254.08 → 2257.38] He's there
[2257.38 → 2258.40] Ruling over
[2258.40 → 2259.38] All things
[2259.38 → 2265.36] I've already
[2265.36 → 2265.88] Mentioned
[2265.88 → 2266.72] Matthew 16
[2266.72 → 2267.34] Verse 18
[2267.34 → 2268.16] Where Jesus
[2268.16 → 2268.86] Says I
[2268.86 → 2269.40] Will build
[2269.40 → 2270.14] My church
[2270.14 → 2270.82] And the
[2270.82 → 2271.32] Gates of
[2271.32 → 2271.64] Hell
[2271.64 → 2272.42] Shall not
[2272.42 → 2272.98] Prevail
[2272.98 → 2273.48] Against
[2273.48 → 2273.84] It
[2273.84 → 2276.40] Again like
[2276.40 → 2276.72] I said
[2276.72 → 2277.58] Programmatic
[2277.58 → 2278.20] Not only
[2278.20 → 2278.60] For Jesus
[2278.60 → 2279.14] Earthly
[2279.14 → 2279.54] Ministry
[2279.54 → 2280.80] But for
[2280.80 → 2281.02] The
[2281.02 → 2281.42] Ministry
[2281.42 → 2281.82] That he
[2281.82 → 2282.40] Continues
[2282.40 → 2282.92] From his
[2282.92 → 2283.26] Throne
[2283.26 → 2283.60] In heaven
[2283.60 → 2283.82] The
[2283.82 → 2284.10] Ministry
[2284.10 → 2284.98] That he
[2284.98 → 2285.28] Is
[2285.28 → 2286.52] Unfolding
[2286.52 → 2287.14] Even
[2287.14 → 2287.98] Now
[2287.98 → 2289.50] And that
[2289.50 → 2289.78] We
[2289.78 → 2290.30] Are
[2290.30 → 2290.92] A part
[2290.92 → 2291.14] Of
[2291.14 → 2291.66] As
[2291.66 → 2292.32] His
[2292.32 → 2292.58] People
[2292.58 → 2293.00] In this
[2293.00 → 2293.74] Time
[2293.74 → 2294.00] This
[2294.00 → 2294.54] Place
[2294.54 → 2295.74] In 2025
[2295.74 → 2299.26] Remember
[2299.26 → 2299.82] Also
[2299.82 → 2300.18] Jesus
[2300.18 → 2300.64] Words
[2300.64 → 2300.94] At the
[2300.94 → 2301.16] End
[2301.16 → 2302.24] Of
[2302.24 → 2302.68] Matthew
[2302.68 → 2303.22] He
[2303.22 → 2303.42] Says
[2303.42 → 2303.86] All
[2303.86 → 2304.68] Authority
[2304.68 → 2305.24] In
[2305.24 → 2305.54] Heaven
[2305.54 → 2305.94] And on
[2305.94 → 2306.20] Earth
[2306.20 → 2306.58] Has
[2306.58 → 2306.80] Been
[2306.80 → 2307.08] Given
[2307.08 → 2307.34] To
[2307.34 → 2307.62] Me
[2307.62 → 2309.54] There's
[2309.54 → 2309.68] So
[2309.68 → 2309.86] Much
[2309.86 → 2310.24] Talk
[2310.24 → 2310.52] These
[2310.52 → 2310.78] Days
[2310.78 → 2311.04] About
[2311.04 → 2311.32] Who
[2311.32 → 2311.68] Is
[2311.68 → 2311.90] The
[2311.90 → 2312.58] Strongest
[2312.58 → 2313.02] Person
[2313.02 → 2313.24] Who
[2313.24 → 2313.36] Is
[2313.36 → 2313.50] The
[2313.50 → 2313.94] Strongest
[2313.94 → 2314.50] Man
[2314.50 → 2314.66] Or
[2314.66 → 2314.82] The
[2314.82 → 2315.22] Strongest
[2315.22 → 2315.58] Woman
[2315.58 → 2315.76] In
[2315.76 → 2315.86] The
[2315.86 → 2316.12] World
[2316.12 → 2316.54] Who
[2316.54 → 2316.68] Is
[2316.68 → 2316.86] The
[2316.86 → 2317.34] Richest
[2317.34 → 2317.98] Man
[2317.98 → 2318.92] In
[2318.92 → 2319.04] The
[2319.04 → 2319.34] World
[2319.34 → 2319.84] And
[2319.84 → 2320.10] So
[2320.10 → 2320.44] On
[2320.44 → 2324.68] Let's
[2324.68 → 2324.86] Never
[2324.86 → 2325.32] Forget
[2325.32 → 2327.76] These
[2327.76 → 2328.00] Words
[2328.00 → 2328.16] Of
[2328.16 → 2328.58] Jesus
[2328.58 → 2330.02] All
[2330.02 → 2330.82] Authority
[2330.82 → 2331.18] In
[2331.18 → 2331.56] Heaven
[2331.56 → 2332.02] And
[2332.02 → 2332.32] On
[2332.32 → 2332.64] Earth
[2332.64 → 2332.96] Has
[2332.96 → 2333.16] Been
[2333.16 → 2333.46] Given
[2333.46 → 2334.18] To
[2334.18 → 2334.48] Me
[2334.48 → 2337.98] We
[2337.98 → 2338.12] Don't
[2338.12 → 2338.24] Need
[2338.24 → 2338.32] To
[2338.32 → 2338.46] Be

[2760.70 → 2761.02] Because
[2761.02 → 2761.20] There
[2761.20 → 2761.34] Is
[2761.34 → 2761.66] A lot

[2802.58 → 2802.80] That
[2802.80 → 2802.94] We
[2802.94 → 2803.18] Each
[2803.18 → 2803.46] Do

[2813.38 → 2813.52] Words
[2813.52 → 2813.70] It's
[2813.70 → 2813.90] Not
[2813.90 → 2814.06] As
[2814.06 → 2814.20] Though
[2814.20 → 2814.64] Paul

[3995.06 → 3998.84] For
[3998.84 → 4013.88] Thank you, Pastor Theo, for the message and for our wonderful musicians to that response.
[4014.38 → 4018.02] Very glad that we could have the trumpet on for that last song especially.
[4019.10 → 4022.70] Our offering this morning is for the Ministry of Seafarers,
[4022.70 → 4025.68] and of course we've been supporting the seafarers for a very long time,
[4025.68 → 4030.30] but as a reminder, the seafarers' ministry is a chaplaincy here in Vancouver,
[4030.92 → 4035.80] currently led by Gary Rosema, who's preached here obviously a number of times as well,
[4036.20 → 4040.30] and that support goes to the seafarers, to the ministry,
[4040.76 → 4042.82] and that happens right here in the Port of Vancouver,
[4043.02 → 4046.50] as well as Roberts Bank right here in Delta, which is great and local.
[4046.70 → 4048.54] So please give as you are able.
[4055.68 → 4085.66] Thank you.
[4085.68 → 4115.66] Thank you.
[4115.92 → 4117.36] Thank you.
[4117.44 → 4121.28] Thank you.
[4121.34 → 4123.62] Thank you.
[4124.38 → 4127.20] Thank you.
[4127.20 → 4128.20] Amen.
[4157.20 → 4168.82] Let's come now to our God as a congregation and bring our prayers to him.
[4170.96 → 4180.20] Holy, holy, holy God, we worship you, the eternal, the all-powerful, the ever-present,
[4180.20 → 4190.64] the creator of the universe, but also a God who loves us and knows us, knows us so well
[4190.64 → 4194.38] that even the hairs on our head are numbered.
[4195.68 → 4201.68] You are a God who is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love and in mercy.
[4202.50 → 4205.84] You are a God that faithfully attends to the suffering of the very least.
[4205.84 → 4209.50] You call us your children and dwell among us.
[4209.50 → 4212.86] Here, this morning, in this very place.
[4214.24 → 4217.22] Thank you for the many blessings you have poured out on us.
[4217.62 → 4221.08] In the midst of summer here in BC, we celebrate your awesome creation.
[4221.90 → 4224.08] What a bounty you have laid before us.
[4224.78 → 4228.52] Long, warm, sunny days, enjoyed with friends and family,
[4229.28 → 4231.92] perhaps over a bowl of fresh Okanagan cherries.
[4232.24 → 4235.88] Your goodness surrounds us, Lord, and we praise you.
[4235.88 → 4239.96] We pray this morning for our leaders locally here in Delta,
[4240.30 → 4242.56] but also in our province and throughout the country.
[4243.52 → 4244.86] Grant them wisdom and humility.
[4245.92 → 4248.98] May they work together to bring prosperity and justice to all,
[4249.66 → 4254.04] but especially justice for those who are marginalized by society.
[4254.04 → 4258.66] Be with the leaders of the world who are dealing with enormous suffering,
[4259.22 → 4263.24] be it the migration crisis or the many wars raging throughout the world.
[4264.04 → 4270.70] We pray in particular this morning for Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, and the rest of Central Africa.
[4270.70 → 4277.22] The suffering is immense, and they are in need of your peace and your sovereignty.
[4278.72 → 4282.32] Closer to home, we ask for comfort for our congregation.
[4283.14 → 4285.26] Draw near to those suffering from illnesses
[4285.26 → 4289.38] or for those caring for those who are suffering through illness.
[4289.38 → 4297.78] We pray especially this morning for Pat, Shirley, Eileen, Hank and Liz, and Tony.
[4299.38 → 4305.68] Lord, we ask for our health and comfort for Wilma Van Toll as she's dealing with significant pain.
[4306.70 → 4309.96] Be with her doctors as they work to diagnose the cause.
[4310.72 → 4313.36] We pray too for Michael, stricken with cancer.
[4313.92 → 4315.42] Be with Michael and the doctors.
[4315.42 → 4321.74] We boldly ask, Lord, for nothing less than complete remission of his cancer.
[4323.60 → 4328.40] This morning, we grieve the passing of Art Hoekstra and Ellie Burma.
[4328.96 → 4332.36] We thank you, Lord, for their many years among us,
[4332.76 → 4336.32] but we know that it is still never easy to say goodbye.
[4337.70 → 4342.14] Surround the families with your love and comfort as they mourn.
[4342.14 → 4346.60] Let us come alongside them and weep.
[4349.22 → 4354.70] Finally, we pray for all those among us with unseen and unheard suffering.
[4355.50 → 4358.44] We lift those up who are struggling with substance abuse,
[4359.16 → 4362.12] with loneliness, with depression, and despair.
[4362.12 → 4369.52] We may not know their suffering, but you, O Lord, know them intimately.
[4371.64 → 4378.24] May they know that they are loved by you and may they find comfort within this community.
[4379.74 → 4383.24] Grant strength and healing and hope to those who stand in need of it.
[4383.24 → 4388.42] While we are helpless, you are the great physician and the wonderful counsellor.
[4389.08 → 4394.32] We know that you are a God who suffers with us and alongside us.
[4394.66 → 4397.22] You walk among us and fill us up with your spirit.
[4398.08 → 4400.28] Help us to always look to you when we struggle.
[4400.98 → 4402.60] In Jesus' powerful name we pray.
[4403.48 → 4403.74] Amen.
[4403.74 → 4409.04] I'd like to invite Pastor Theo back up for a parting blessing.
[4422.54 → 4425.14] The Lord God, please rise.
[4425.14 → 4432.46] We've heard in the gospel about the power of our God, about the power of our Saviour,
[4433.18 → 4437.34] and it's in his power and his grace that we also go forward into this world
[4437.34 → 4441.42] and minister to each other, care for each other,
[4441.58 → 4447.86] but also are a light and a witness in this world of the love and power and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4448.00 → 4448.78] Receive his blessing.
[4449.82 → 4451.28] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4451.36 → 4454.24] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4454.24 → 4457.46] The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace.
[4457.76 → 4460.70] In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[4460.70 → 4460.90] Amen.
[4460.90 → 4485.82] Salvation belongs to our God, who sits upon the throne.
[4485.82 → 4486.64] Lord, we NCAA has centred in this world for you and will beенным to his glory.
[4500.72 → 4505.72] And compassion is to give you what we have heard and confidence in this world,
[4505.72 → 4507.72] Amen.
[4535.72 → 4537.72] Amen.
[4565.72 → 4567.72] Amen.
[4595.72 → 4597.72] Amen.
[4625.72 → 4627.72] Amen.
[4655.72 → 4657.72] Amen.
