• Discussion of how Jesus' teachings can be seen as harsh or unexpected
• Jesus will baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire, bringing both salvation and judgment
• Division between believers and unbelievers is a result of this baptism, separating wheat from chaff
• Destruction or judgment on those who oppose God's righteousness and justice is also part of this image
• The Messiah brings both salvation (union with God, forgiveness) and judgment (division and destruction)
• Jesus' message of judgment is good news for those who respond to him in faith
• The response to Jesus determines whether his baptism is seen as good news or bad news
• Jesus' baptism was for those who acknowledge their need for cleansing and forgiveness.
• The gospel is good news only to those who know they need it and are willing to undergo humility.
• John the Baptist was a flawed prophet who needed grace himself.
• Jesus surpasses even John's expectations as the Messiah, with his behaviour of washing his disciples' feet being an example of his humility.
• Jesus' act of washing his disciples' feet shows that he exercises power by taking on the position of a lowly servant.
• Jesus came to serve humanity and invite them into the kingdom through his sacrifice and gift of the Holy Spirit.
