[0.00 → 23.86] Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ladder Christian Reformed Church. My name is Jason
[23.86 → 28.92] True. I'm the lead pastor here, along with Nancy, who's our pastor for Chinese ministry.
[28.92 → 36.22] Today is Family Worship Sunday, where we worship together as a whole church body, and we'll
[36.22 → 42.22] be celebrating the Lord's Supper as well later. Anybody notice anything different today?
[43.22 → 58.06] Yeah, exactly. Finally. Yeah, so these TV screens have been in the works for a while,
[58.06 → 65.14] and so we were going to replace our projector, and we had actually saved up some funds to replace it,
[65.70 → 71.78] and then the idea arose to actually use TV screens instead, and actually it was a significant cost
[71.78 → 78.16] savings to use these, and this is our first Sunday using them. We welcome feedback. You can all go to
[78.16 → 85.66] Don, not me. So, and you know, maybe there'll be some tweaks, but we'll see how it works. Hopefully
[85.66 → 95.44] it will go well, and it's nice also to have the cross front and centre, right? So, two announcements.
[95.90 → 102.46] One is today at two o'clock, we will be going to Mountain View Manor and singing to the residents
[102.46 → 107.82] there. So, if you are able and willing, please do come along and we'll sing together.
[107.82 → 115.70] The second announcement is that there is a congregational meeting in AGM this Wednesday
[115.70 → 122.52] at seven o'clock. Are we in here or in there? Yeah, in the sanctuary this time, and we will be going over
[122.52 → 129.88] the financials, the budget. If you are a member of the church, please do come out, but everyone is
[129.88 → 138.68] welcome also to come. So, let's hear God call us to worship this morning from Psalm 91. This will be a
[138.68 → 144.42] call and response. I'll begin. I'll ask you to read aloud where it has the double arrows.
[146.74 → 153.70] Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[153.70 → 163.02] I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[163.86 → 169.74] Let's join our hearts together in a prayer of adoration as we come before the Lord to praise Him
[169.74 → 171.40] for who He is. Let's pray together.
[173.52 → 180.38] Lord God, Heavenly Father, we gather in this place not because we are deserving of Your love,
[180.38 → 189.06] not because we have lived faithfully before Your face, but Lord, we gather here because You have
[189.06 → 197.98] called us. You loved us before we could love You. You have given Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[197.98 → 204.30] for our salvation. And for this, we join all creation in blessing You, praising Your name,
[204.30 → 213.00] and giving You our thanks. You are a God who is great and greatly to be praised. You are our refuge
[213.00 → 222.14] and our fortress. You are the God in whom we trust. And so, we offer our praise and we long for You to make
[222.14 → 229.22] us and form us more and more in the image of Your Son through the power of Your Holy Spirit. Lord, we are glad to
[229.22 → 238.16] be in Your house and to worship You as Your people. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's all rise and hear
[238.16 → 243.50] God's greeting to us today from 2 Corinthians 1, verse 4. It says,
[243.50 → 251.90] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all
[251.90 → 259.66] comfort who comforts us in all our troubles. As God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[281.90 → 311.88] Thank you.
[311.90 → 313.98] Greetings to you from myself.
[314.68 → 318.80] And just a note about our first song, All Creatures of Our God and King.
[319.38 → 331.98] You may not know, and I just came upon it this week, that this is the 800th anniversary of the words of this song, written by Francis of Assisi in 1225.
[331.98 → 340.24] So the tune was added in 1910, but we have a heritage.
[340.24 → 342.44] It's not some new fangled faith.
[342.56 → 353.72] It has the longevity of what we read in the Bible and the heritage of what we can use to praise and sing to God, lift our voices is centuries old.
[353.72 → 363.38] But ever new in our hearts, and I invite you to join in as we join our voices and our languages together in praise of our God.

[909.40 → 925.16] Thousands.
[939.40 → 961.36] So we come now to a time of confession and assurance.
[961.36 → 965.36] As we prepare to confess our sins before Almighty God,
[965.36 → 969.82] hear this call to confession from Psalm 51.
[971.04 → 972.16] Psalmist says this,
[972.64 → 985.80] So I will lead us in a prayer of confession,
[986.30 → 989.98] and then I want to give you some time for you to come before the Lord
[989.98 → 993.90] with confessing your own sins silently and privately to him.
[993.90 → 996.08] So please join me in prayer.
[998.12 → 999.88] Most merciful God,
[1000.78 → 1002.82] whose Son, Jesus Christ,
[1003.20 → 1005.24] was tempted in every way,
[1006.36 → 1007.68] yet was without sin.
[1008.22 → 1011.26] We confess before you our own sinfulness.
[1012.34 → 1015.34] We have hungered after that which does not satisfy.
[1016.34 → 1018.54] We have compromised with evil.
[1019.68 → 1023.70] We have doubted your power to protect us.
[1024.80 → 1027.30] Forgive, O Lord, our lack of faith
[1027.30 → 1029.80] and have mercy on our weakness.
[1030.58 → 1035.18] Restore in us such trust and love for you
[1035.18 → 1037.86] that we may walk in your ways
[1037.86 → 1040.26] and delight in doing your will.
[1040.94 → 1043.30] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1043.60 → 1044.08] Amen.
[1062.62 → 1064.64] O Lord, we thank you for the freedom
[1064.64 → 1066.52] to come before you as your children.
[1067.52 → 1075.14] We thank you, Lord, that you see us in all the dignity in which you have made us.
[1075.50 → 1079.64] Lord, you see us in the corruption in which we have fallen because of our sin.
[1080.80 → 1084.64] And Lord, you loved us so much that you came to save us
[1084.64 → 1089.34] and to make us your children and to give us the grace of your spirit
[1089.34 → 1096.88] to lead us in your ways, to turn away from our sin and turn towards you.
[1097.66 → 1101.96] And Lord, we pray that you would help us to continually, day by day, week by week,
[1101.96 → 1108.02] be renewed in the grace of the gospel through the death and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1108.64 → 1112.14] And Lord, we thank you and praise you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1113.70 → 1116.92] Now, when we sin against someone else,
[1116.92 → 1123.68] we can't control, unfortunately, whether they will forgive us.
[1125.32 → 1127.72] And that can really grieve us, right?
[1127.78 → 1135.30] When others, for whatever reason, refuse to offer us forgiveness when we confess to them.
[1136.14 → 1141.92] But what the scriptures promise us is that for those who are in Christ our Lord,
[1142.72 → 1145.82] our confession to God is never the last word.
[1145.82 → 1148.30] Because there's always a response.
[1148.52 → 1152.58] There's always a word of assurance of our forgiveness.
[1153.72 → 1157.50] And so our confession to God never falls on deaf ears
[1157.50 → 1162.22] because the Lord never refuses to forgive us.
[1162.68 → 1166.90] So let's stand and hear together these words of assurance
[1166.90 → 1168.84] that God gives to us in his word.
[1168.96 → 1172.46] This comes from Isaiah 52, verses 9 to 10.
[1172.46 → 1178.52] Burst into songs of joy together, you ruin of Jerusalem.
[1179.02 → 1181.08] For the Lord has comforted his people.
[1181.80 → 1183.56] He has redeemed Jerusalem.
[1184.16 → 1188.06] The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations.
[1188.78 → 1194.36] And all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
[1194.94 → 1195.88] Thanks be to God.
[1195.88 → 1199.40] So let's remain standing and let's sing another song together.
[1199.40 → 1229.38] Let's sing another song together.
[1229.40 → 1259.38] Let's sing another song together.
[1259.38 → 1261.38] Let's sing another song together.
[1261.38 → 1289.36] Let's sing another song together.
[1289.36 → 1319.34] Let's sing another song together.
[1319.34 → 1324.34] He has lived the most important thing
[1324.34 → 1327.34] I am not in the world,
[1327.34 → 1329.34] I am in the world of faith
[1329.34 → 1332.34] I am in the world of faith
[1332.34 → 1335.34] He is also me
[1335.34 → 1340.34] I am in the world of faith
[1342.34 → 1348.34] No guilt in life, no fear in death
[1348.34 → 1353.34] This is the power of Christ to hear
[1353.34 → 1358.34] Some lives were trying to find no breath
[1358.34 → 1363.34] Jesus will chant my destiny
[1363.34 → 1368.34] No power of shame, no hope in life
[1368.34 → 1373.34] And ever walk me from His hand
[1373.34 → 1379.34] Till He returns, no calls He home
[1379.34 → 1385.34] Even the power of Christ to stand
[1385.34 → 1390.34] In the world of faith
[1390.34 → 1409.34] So we come now to the time when we celebrate the sacrament of the Lord's Supper
[1409.34 → 1415.34] And as we prepare to come to the table, let's confess or profess what we believe
[1415.34 → 1420.34] And today we will do that using the words of the Heidelberg Catechism
[1420.34 → 1423.34] Question and answer 37
[1423.34 → 1426.34] So let's read this together
[1426.34 → 1430.34] During His whole life on earth
[1430.34 → 1432.34] But especially at the end
[1432.34 → 1436.34] Christ sustained in body and soul
[1436.34 → 1441.34] The wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race
[1441.34 → 1449.34] This He did in order that by His suffering as the only atonable sacrifice
[1449.34 → 1455.34] He might deliver us body and soul from eternal condemnation
[1455.34 → 1462.34] And gain for us God's grace, righteousness, and eternal life
[1462.34 → 1463.34] Thanks be to God
[1463.34 → 1468.34] Well friends, we come now to the table of the Lord
[1468.34 → 1473.34] This meal that our Lord Jesus prepared for us
[1473.34 → 1476.34] And He prepared this meal for us
[1476.34 → 1480.34] So that we would be renewed in His grace
[1480.34 → 1483.34] Through this ordinary bread, the ordinary juice
[1483.34 → 1491.34] And this meal is for all those who have called on the Lord by faith
[1491.34 → 1495.34] And who have been baptized into the Christian church
[1495.34 → 1497.34] And so if you are here this morning
[1497.34 → 1501.34] And you have not yet put your faith in the Lord Jesus
[1501.34 → 1503.34] You are our most welcome guest
[1503.34 → 1505.34] We are so glad that you're here
[1505.34 → 1509.34] And I'd love to talk to you after the service
[1509.34 → 1513.34] Because we believe that you are here by God's appointment
[1513.34 → 1516.34] And that He's at work in your life
[1516.34 → 1518.34] And that's an exciting thing
[1518.34 → 1522.34] But at the same time, even as the elements are passed to you
[1522.34 → 1525.34] Today is not the day for you to take them
[1525.34 → 1529.34] And not because we're stingy with our little bits of bread
[1529.34 → 1533.34] But because this meal can only benefit us spiritually
[1533.34 → 1537.34] When we eat and drink in faith
[1537.34 → 1541.34] And when we do so trusting in the death and the resurrection
[1541.34 → 1543.34] Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1543.34 → 1546.34] And so let's pray together
[1546.34 → 1548.34] And ask for God's blessing upon this meal
[1548.34 → 1552.34] Our Father in heaven, we lift our hearts to you this day
[1552.34 → 1558.34] In awe, in wonder, in admiration, and in praise
[1558.34 → 1564.34] Thank you, Lord, for the glorious news of the Gospel
[1564.34 → 1567.34] And for the wonderful and wondrous change
[1567.34 → 1570.34] That you make in us
[1570.34 → 1573.34] For all of those who are united to you by faith
[1573.34 → 1576.34] And Father, by the power of your Spirit
[1576.34 → 1579.34] Would you set apart this bread and this cup
[1579.34 → 1583.34] So that receiving them through faith
[1583.34 → 1586.34] Our hearts would be united to the risen
[1586.34 → 1589.34] And ascended and ruling and reigning
[1589.34 → 1592.34] Great High Priest, our Lord Jesus Christ
[1592.34 → 1594.34] And it is in his name that we pray
[1594.34 → 1595.34] Amen
[1597.34 → 1601.34] So hear now the words of the institution of the Lord's Supper
[1601.34 → 1602.34] From the Apostle Paul
[1602.34 → 1604.34] The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed
[1604.34 → 1605.34] He took bread
[1605.34 → 1607.34] And when he had given thanks
[1607.34 → 1608.34] He broke it
[1608.34 → 1609.34] And he said
[1609.34 → 1612.34] This is my body which is for you
[1612.34 → 1615.34] Do this in remembrance of me
[1615.34 → 1617.34] In the same way after supper
[1617.34 → 1618.34] He took the cup
[1618.34 → 1619.34] And he said
[1619.34 → 1621.34] This cup is the cup of the new covenant
[1621.34 → 1622.34] In my blood
[1622.34 → 1628.34] For whenever you eat this bread
[1628.34 → 1629.34] And drink this cup
[1629.34 → 1631.34] You proclaim the Lord's death
[1631.34 → 1633.34] Until he comes again
[1634.34 → 1635.34] And so let's
[1635.34 → 1637.34] We haven't done this I don't think for a couple of months
[1637.34 → 1639.34] But let's say our communion liturgy together
[1639.34 → 1642.34] Brothers and sisters lift your hearts
[1642.34 → 1644.34] We lift them up to the Lord
[1644.34 → 1646.34] We are his people
[1646.34 → 1648.34] We are redeemed by his grace
[1648.34 → 1651.34] Let us proclaim the mystery of faith
[1651.34 → 1653.34] Christ has died
[1653.34 → 1654.34] Christ is risen
[1654.34 → 1656.34] Christ will come again
[1656.34 → 1660.34] Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us
[1660.34 → 1661.34] Hallelujah
[1661.34 → 1662.34] Hallelujah
[1662.34 → 1664.34] Brothers and sisters
[1664.34 → 1666.34] These are the gifts of God for you as people
[1666.34 → 1669.34] Let's take them and eat
[1669.34 → 1671.34] With great thanksgiving
[1671.34 → 1673.34] And do so with faith
[1674.34 → 1676.34] Knowing, trusting, believing
[1676.34 → 1678.34] That our Lord Jesus died for us
[1679.34 → 1681.34] May I ask our elders and deacons who are serving
[1681.34 → 1683.34] To come forward and help me distribute the elements
[1683.34 → 1685.34] To come forward and help me distribute the elements
[1713.34 → 1716.34] And the clothes Krankenkieron too
[1716.34 → 1717.76] Not from

[2107.54 → 2112.54] that love through the amazing sacrifice of your son on the cross.
[2112.54 → 2114.54] You stood in our place.
[2114.54 → 2119.54] You took our sins and the sins of all of your people onto yourself.
[2119.54 → 2122.54] You rose again, conquering the grave.
[2122.54 → 2128.54] And you have ascended and sit and reign enthroned on high, governing and ruling all things according
[2128.54 → 2129.54] to your good pleasure.
[2129.54 → 2134.54] Father, we thank you that you've taken us from darkness into light.
[2134.54 → 2136.54] You've made us your children.
[2136.54 → 2141.54] And we thank you, Lord, for the gift of your spirit that you would cultivate within us fruits
[2141.54 → 2145.54] of the spirit so that we might follow you.
[2145.54 → 2152.54] Lord, we thank you for this meal that you have shared with us and that you have invited us to.
[2152.54 → 2153.54] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2153.54 → 2154.54] Amen.
[2154.54 → 2155.54] Amen.
[2155.54 → 2156.54] Amen.
[2156.54 → 2159.54] So, children, if you are here, would you please join me down front.

[2187.54 → 2188.54] Okay.
[2188.54 → 2189.54] Okay.
[2189.54 → 2190.54] Good.
[2190.54 → 2191.54] Nice to see you.
[2191.54 → 2196.54] Well, I want to teach you a new word today because it's a word that all the adults are going
[2196.54 → 2197.54] to use.
[2197.54 → 2198.54] Oh, there they go.
[2198.54 → 2199.54] Oh, hello.
[2199.54 → 2200.54] Oh, hello.
[2200.54 → 2201.54] Oh.
[2201.54 → 2202.54] Oh.
[2202.54 → 2203.54] Oh.
[2203.54 → 2204.54] Oh.
[2204.54 → 2205.54] Oh.
[2205.54 → 2206.54] Oh.
[2206.54 → 2207.54] Oh.
[2207.54 → 2208.54] Oh.
[2208.54 → 2209.54] Oh.
[2209.54 → 2210.54] Oh.
[2210.54 → 2211.54] Oh.
[2211.54 → 2212.54] Oh.
[2212.54 → 2213.54] Oh.
[2213.54 → 2214.54] Oh.
[2214.54 → 2215.54] Oh.
[2215.54 → 2216.54] Oh.
[2216.54 → 2217.54] Oh.
[2217.54 → 2218.54] Oh.
[2218.54 → 2219.54] Oh.
[2219.54 → 2220.54] Oh, you've heard me.
[2220.54 → 2221.54] Oh, oh.
[2221.54 → 2222.54] Yes, I'm going to talk about today, and it's the word Lament.
[2222.54 → 2223.54] Can you say Lament?
[2223.54 → 2224.54] Lament.
[2224.54 → 2225.54] Lament.
[2225.54 → 2227.54] What do you think that word means?
[2227.54 → 2238.54] Well, what it means is to be sad and to cry because you're sad about something.
[2238.54 → 2240.54] So let me ask you a question.
[2240.54 → 2244.54] Have you ever felt sad about something?
[2244.54 → 2245.54] Yeah.
[2245.54 → 2253.02] something very hard happened to you or to someone you love. And when something bad happens in the
[2253.02 → 2261.18] world, or maybe you look at the news and you... or anywhere in the world who are suffering,
[2261.78 → 2270.54] and maybe they got hurt, or maybe they're sick. So I have a question. You feel sad,
[2270.54 → 2277.14] whether you got hurt or someone you love feels hurt. Who do you talk to about it?
[2300.54 → 2307.10] You know, I get hurt, you know, the other day, a couple of weeks ago, I was cutting up the vegetables
[2307.10 → 2314.44] and I cut my finger. And those are in the kitchen. So I have a wife on one. I cut my finger.
[2315.56 → 2321.70] Right? So when we get hurt, we want to cry out. And the Bible says that when we are hurt,
[2321.70 → 2337.38] when we... Psalm 13, verse 1. How long, O Lord, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
[2338.66 → 2348.12] And so in this verse, the psalmist explains or talks about how he's feeling. He feels like when he's
[2348.12 → 2352.82] heard that God's not listening to him. That maybe God has turned away. God's not paying attention.
[2354.00 → 2361.22] And so he asks, how long, God, until you answer me? And so that's what... word lament?
[2363.46 → 2369.12] Lament. What it means is, feeling sad, we can tell... we can tell God all about...
[2369.12 → 2370.90] So I'm going to show you a hand motion.
[2373.82 → 2380.40] So we talk to God in prayer, and we lament, and we say, God, why is this happening?
[2380.64 → 2381.30] When will you...
[2381.30 → 2389.12] Lament. How long...
[2391.00 → 2393.12] Happy.
[2393.12 → 2394.00] Happy.
[2394.00 → 2420.00] To cart.
[2420.00 → 2423.78] Thank you.
[2450.00 → 2465.98] So, good morning again.
[2468.98 → 2473.12] Today is the first Sunday in the season of Lent.
[2475.48 → 2477.24] And so what is Lent?
[2477.24 → 2486.86] Maybe it's not familiar to a lot of us, but what it is simply, just like Christmas and Easter are seasons in the church calendar, Lent is a season.
[2487.34 → 2497.08] And it's a season when the church around the world, when we turn our attention to the suffering and the death of our Lord Jesus Christ for our salvation.
[2497.52 → 2498.42] That's what Lent is about.
[2498.42 → 2509.04] And it's also time for us when we consider what it means for us to follow this suffering Saviour as his disciples.
[2510.14 → 2515.54] Especially in a world that is so full of sorrow.
[2515.54 → 2525.50] And so in order to help us do this, in order to help us, you know, turn our attention to the suffering and death of Christ and what it means for us to follow him,
[2526.04 → 2533.54] we will be in a sermon series that will be five weeks long in this season of Lent in the Old Testament book of Lamentations.
[2533.54 → 2542.64] Now, I'm also very much aware that, for many of us, the book of Lamentations is somewhat unfamiliar.
[2544.16 → 2546.06] It's not often preached on.
[2546.98 → 2551.24] And we might not even read it very often, if at all.
[2552.60 → 2555.12] Has everyone read the book of Lamentations before?
[2555.12 → 2557.14] Most of us.
[2557.28 → 2558.84] Probably you're not going to raise your hand if you didn't.
[2559.20 → 2559.88] I didn't ask that.
[2561.68 → 2571.74] So, to begin, I want to orient us a little bit to this book and to the message of Lamentations before we read our text today.
[2571.74 → 2585.28] So, in the summer of 587 BC, the city of Jerusalem, the great city, was sacked and conquered by the Babylonian Empire.
[2586.42 → 2595.38] Her citizens were killed or taken as captives to Babylon or left to suffer and die in a city that was laid to waste.
[2596.48 → 2600.30] And the book of Lamentations is composed of five poems.
[2600.30 → 2605.72] Each chapter is a different poem that were written in response to this tragedy.
[2606.90 → 2607.92] And so, that's our context.
[2608.30 → 2613.66] It's not a cheerful one, which is probably why we don't often read this book.
[2614.98 → 2619.18] Now, Lamentations has an important literary feature as well.
[2619.40 → 2627.86] The first four chapters of this book are four poems that are written as acrostics, right, using the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
[2627.86 → 2629.38] So, it goes like this.
[2629.50 → 2631.18] Verse 1 starts with A.
[2631.58 → 2633.86] Verse 2 starts with B.
[2634.24 → 2634.80] And so on.
[2636.84 → 2639.18] So, why was it written in this way?
[2639.88 → 2641.90] Why this formalized poetry?
[2643.00 → 2644.26] Well, there are two reasons.
[2644.26 → 2654.36] The first is because it's an attempt to describe and explore the suffering of God's people in its entirety.
[2655.08 → 2656.42] So, you can think of it like this.
[2656.48 → 2659.76] This is suffering from A to Z.
[2661.52 → 2663.42] I did it right because I'm a Canadian now.
[2663.82 → 2664.42] A to Z.
[2664.42 → 2670.74] Or, more accurately, if you're not a Canadian, and you're a Hebrew, Aleph to Tax.
[2672.00 → 2678.70] Now, the second reason is that the Book of Lamentations is an attempt to give some sort of order to chaos.
[2679.76 → 2680.28] Right?
[2680.34 → 2685.00] And one of the messages of the book is that even in the face of disorder and destruction,
[2685.00 → 2692.66] all things are under the providential ordering of the one who orders all things.
[2695.16 → 2702.66] So, another thing to be aware of is that these five poems are communal rather than personal.
[2703.44 → 2703.58] Okay?
[2703.62 → 2705.38] They're communal rather than individual.
[2706.38 → 2707.70] And so, think of it like this.
[2707.70 → 2712.80] Yes, the Old Testament book of Job deals with the problem of personal suffering.
[2713.30 → 2715.34] Why am I suffering?
[2716.20 → 2719.82] The Book of Lamentations deals with communal suffering.
[2719.98 → 2724.24] Why are we suffering as a city, as a nation, as a people?
[2725.44 → 2728.86] And so, in a word, Lamentations teaches us to lament.
[2729.70 → 2736.88] It shows us how crying out to God in our grief and our sorrow is actually a crucial part of the journey of faith
[2736.88 → 2740.10] for God's people living in a broken world.
[2741.36 → 2741.58] Right?
[2741.66 → 2744.84] In a world of overwhelming suffering,
[2746.56 → 2756.72] Lamentations gives us a voice for the deepest agonies of grief.
[2757.72 → 2760.10] But it does so also with hope.
[2760.76 → 2766.16] That hope that some comfort may be found in crying out to God for his mercy.
[2766.88 → 2768.58] And so, what is lament?
[2768.72 → 2776.32] Lament is speaking our raw and honest confusion and sorrow and pain to God
[2776.32 → 2779.24] in hopes that he will come and heal us.
[2780.80 → 2782.12] Let me say that one more time.
[2782.26 → 2787.94] Lament is speaking our raw and honest confusion, sorrow and pain to God
[2787.94 → 2791.36] in hopes that he will come and heal us.
[2792.32 → 2794.04] And so, lament is a form of protest.
[2794.04 → 2800.02] It's a protest where we call on God to see and to pay attention
[2800.02 → 2803.00] to all the things happening that should not be happening.
[2803.76 → 2803.88] Right?
[2803.96 → 2806.56] To all things that are wrong.
[2808.88 → 2813.24] And so, lament teaches us that suffering in silence is not a Christian virtue.
[2813.24 → 2817.76] And that kind of goes counter to our Western culture.
[2817.90 → 2822.46] Especially, you know, we have this ideal of the strong, silent type.
[2823.60 → 2824.60] That's not Christian.
[2826.00 → 2832.02] The Lord doesn't tell us just to, you know, suck it up and tighten our belts and get on with it.
[2832.02 → 2836.40] The Lord invites us to tell him how we really feel.
[2836.86 → 2840.60] To deeply express all of our anguish.
[2841.26 → 2847.46] And he invites us to honestly do that even when that honesty is painful.
[2849.04 → 2850.66] And so, lament is important to know.
[2850.74 → 2852.72] Also, it's not the same as grumbling.
[2853.58 → 2854.06] Right?
[2854.06 → 2855.68] So, we know we're not supposed to grumble.
[2855.86 → 2858.00] We're supposed to be joyful in all situations.
[2858.30 → 2859.62] Not because of all situations.
[2860.50 → 2863.42] And so, how can lament and that kind of go together?
[2863.62 → 2867.66] Well, it's because grumbling has already reached a conclusion.
[2869.10 → 2871.18] And the conclusion is an accusation.
[2872.44 → 2874.74] But lament has not reached a conclusion.
[2874.74 → 2881.84] Because true lament, true Christian lament, it springs from this experience of confusion.
[2882.98 → 2886.14] And the questions of lament are genuine questions.
[2887.16 → 2891.14] And the driving question of lament is, how long, O Lord?
[2892.16 → 2893.90] How long, O Lord?
[2894.70 → 2897.44] And there is not an assumed answer to that.
[2898.38 → 2898.94] Right?
[2899.02 → 2899.92] It's a real question.
[2900.18 → 2900.86] How long, Lord?
[2901.62 → 2903.06] It's an open-ended question.
[2903.06 → 2904.96] It hasn't reached a conclusion.
[2905.08 → 2907.98] It's not grumbling that, oh, it will never be healed.
[2908.86 → 2910.60] But, Lord, when are you going to heal it?
[2911.94 → 2913.10] That's the question of lament.
[2914.36 → 2917.48] And so, lament moves towards God with those questions.
[2918.00 → 2919.94] It doesn't move away from God or withdraw.
[2920.32 → 2921.56] It moves towards God.
[2922.34 → 2925.52] And that is why lament has the potential to change our hearts.
[2926.72 → 2932.66] Because it compels within us, in the soil of the darkness of the world,
[2932.66 → 2935.50] it compels us to search.
[2936.58 → 2942.28] It compels us to wrestle with God and to put our hope in him.
[2943.36 → 2947.24] So, with that, let's turn to Lamentations chapter 1.
[2947.24 → 2957.96] So, Lamentations is tucked in between the Old Testament prophets of Isaiah and Jeremiah.
[2959.42 → 2960.26] Oh, sorry.
[2961.52 → 2962.50] Jeremiah, Ezekiel.
[2963.08 → 2967.68] So, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel.
[2967.68 → 2972.20] So, that's on page 614 in your pre-Bible.
[2972.26 → 2975.00] If you want to follow along, I've got it on the screen.
[2976.76 → 2978.76] And so, this is a longer reading.
[2979.18 → 2979.96] It's not terrible.
[2980.68 → 2983.48] But let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2983.48 → 2991.76] How deserted lies the city, once so full of people.
[2993.04 → 2997.30] How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations.
[2998.36 → 3002.08] She who is queen among the provinces has now become a slave.
[3002.88 → 3006.64] Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks.
[3007.48 → 3009.96] Among all of her lovers there is none to comfort her.
[3009.96 → 3012.40] All of her friends have betrayed her.
[3012.72 → 3014.00] They have become her enemies.
[3014.74 → 3018.10] After affliction and harsh labour, Judah was gone into exile.
[3018.48 → 3020.08] She dwells among the nations.
[3020.26 → 3021.68] She finds no resting place.
[3022.20 → 3025.86] All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
[3027.66 → 3031.88] The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts.
[3032.40 → 3033.74] All of her gates are desolate.
[3033.90 → 3034.92] Her priests mourn.
[3035.24 → 3037.56] Her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.
[3037.56 → 3040.86] Her foes have become her masters.
[3041.38 → 3043.00] Her enemies are at ease.
[3043.76 → 3046.60] The Lord has brought her grief because of her many sins.
[3047.02 → 3050.48] Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.
[3051.40 → 3054.26] All the splendour has departed from the daughter of Zion.
[3054.86 → 3057.42] Her princes are like deer that find no pasture.
[3058.06 → 3060.32] In weakness they have fled before the pursuer.
[3061.34 → 3063.48] In the days of her affliction and wandering,
[3063.48 → 3067.14] Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old.
[3067.36 → 3070.98] When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her.
[3071.58 → 3074.46] Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.
[3075.90 → 3079.60] Jerusalem has sinned greatly, and so has become unclean.
[3079.60 → 3084.48] All who honoured her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness.
[3085.00 → 3086.90] She herself groans and turns away.
[3087.94 → 3090.06] Her filthiness clung to her skirts.
[3090.62 → 3092.36] She did not consider her future.
[3092.52 → 3093.82] Her fall was astounding.
[3094.62 → 3096.00] There was none to comfort her.
[3097.32 → 3101.14] Look, O Lord, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed.
[3101.68 → 3104.22] The enemy laid hands on all of her treasures.
[3104.22 → 3107.04] She saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary.
[3107.86 → 3112.48] Those who had forbidden, you had forbidden, to enter your assembly.
[3113.02 → 3115.62] All her people groan as they search for bread.
[3116.18 → 3119.50] They barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive.
[3120.20 → 3122.74] Look, O Lord, and consider, for I am despised.
[3123.98 → 3127.56] Is it nothing to you, you who pass by?
[3128.48 → 3133.86] Look around and see, is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me?
[3134.22 → 3137.70] That the Lord brought on me in the days of his fierce anger.
[3138.74 → 3142.26] From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones.
[3142.70 → 3145.60] He spread a net for my feet and turned me back.
[3146.20 → 3148.60] He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
[3149.84 → 3152.56] My sins have been bound into a yoke.
[3152.98 → 3154.98] By his hands they were woven together.
[3155.70 → 3158.94] They have come upon my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength.
[3159.58 → 3162.56] He has handed me over to those I cannot understand.
[3162.56 → 3167.64] The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst.
[3168.12 → 3171.66] He has summoned an army against me to crush my young men.
[3172.60 → 3176.92] In his wine press the Lord has trampled the virgin daughter of Judah.
[3178.48 → 3181.86] This is why I weep, and my eyes overflow with tears.
[3182.46 → 3185.66] No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit.
[3185.66 → 3189.84] My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.
[3189.84 → 3196.68] Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her.
[3197.30 → 3202.06] The Lord has decreed for Jacob that his neighbours become his foes.
[3202.74 → 3206.12] Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
[3207.00 → 3210.06] The Lord is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command.
[3210.98 → 3213.44] Listen, all you peoples, look upon my suffering.
[3213.86 → 3216.12] My young men and maidens have gone into exile.
[3216.12 → 3220.38] I called to my allies, but they betrayed me.
[3221.30 → 3223.82] My priests and my elders perished in the city,
[3224.04 → 3226.86] while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
[3227.44 → 3229.48] See, O Lord, how distressed I am.
[3229.90 → 3233.22] I am in torment within me, and in my heart I am disturbed,
[3233.74 → 3235.76] for I have been most rebellious.
[3236.56 → 3240.36] Outside the sword bereaves, inside there is only death.
[3241.26 → 3244.84] People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me.
[3244.84 → 3247.46] All my enemies have heard of my distress.
[3247.58 → 3249.20] They rejoice at what they have done.
[3250.10 → 3252.26] May you bring the day you have announced,
[3252.52 → 3254.16] so they may become like me.
[3254.78 → 3256.92] Let all their wickedness come before you.
[3257.04 → 3260.22] Deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins.
[3260.82 → 3263.74] My groans are many, and my heart is faint.
[3264.70 → 3265.90] This is the word of the Lord.
[3265.90 → 3268.72] Let's pray.
[3271.36 → 3276.94] Gracious Father, we pray that your Holy Spirit will now open your word to our hearts.
[3277.50 → 3280.48] And Lord, would your Spirit open our hearts to your word,
[3280.72 → 3286.14] that we may believe and receive the things that belong to our peace and our joy,
[3286.30 → 3287.40] our comfort and our hope.
[3287.90 → 3289.42] We pray in Christ's name.
[3289.88 → 3290.18] Amen.
[3290.18 → 3290.28] Amen.
[3292.80 → 3304.08] So on May 22, 2011, one of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history struck the town of Joplin, Missouri.
[3304.90 → 3308.40] Here's a photo of the destruction.
[3308.40 → 3313.54] So you can just see how this tornado came through just levelled neighbourhoods.
[3314.46 → 3317.92] The tornado was measured as an EF5.
[3318.30 → 3322.04] That's the highest measurement on the tornado scale.
[3322.68 → 3326.48] It was about a mile wide, 1.6 kilometres.
[3327.44 → 3330.54] And when it came crashing down through the town of Joplin,
[3331.46 → 3334.10] it left this horrible destruction in its wake.
[3334.10 → 3339.80] It was on the ground for almost half an hour, just moving slowly, something like 30, 40 kilometres.
[3342.02 → 3343.92] 161 people lost their lives.
[3344.34 → 3345.86] Over 1,000 people were injured.
[3346.40 → 3348.12] 4,300 homes.
[3348.60 → 3350.18] 500 businesses were destroyed.
[3350.72 → 3356.02] At $2.8 billion in damage, it would go down as the most expensive tornado,
[3356.86 → 3359.12] still to this day in U.S. history.
[3359.12 → 3365.72] And when the storm clouds eventually dissipated and the survivors were able to emerge from their shelters,
[3366.18 → 3375.90] many of these residents of Joplin were faced with some gut-wrenching questions, right?
[3375.96 → 3376.64] As you can imagine.
[3377.24 → 3379.84] Like, how in the world do we pick up the pieces?
[3381.02 → 3385.06] How do we move forward after suffering such loss?
[3385.06 → 3389.78] And when we turn our attention to the book of Lamentations,
[3389.96 → 3395.58] God's people have just faced this kind of devastation, right?
[3395.62 → 3398.92] Not by a tornado, but by the Babylonian army.
[3400.20 → 3406.04] The people of Israel, likewise, faced some gut-wrenching questions.
[3406.90 → 3410.26] How do we process this event that just happened to us?
[3411.60 → 3414.10] What does it tell us about God and ourselves?
[3415.00 → 3417.64] And how in the world do we pick up the pieces and move forward?
[3418.84 → 3421.94] And when we look at this first poem in chapter 1,
[3422.00 → 3425.44] what we find is God's people crying out in lament
[3425.44 → 3430.20] and crying with tears of loneliness and tears of betrayal.
[3431.72 → 3434.68] And those are the two things I want to consider from our passage this morning.
[3434.82 → 3437.18] Tears of loneliness and tears of betrayal.
[3437.50 → 3439.02] So let's start with tears of loneliness.
[3439.22 → 3441.52] Look with me also at verse 1.
[3441.52 → 3446.78] How deserted lies the city once so full of people.
[3449.42 → 3456.20] Have you ever driven through or passed by an abandoned town?
[3456.86 → 3458.42] An abandoned town.
[3458.92 → 3462.06] Or maybe a town where most of the people have left.
[3463.00 → 3465.80] Things have kind of just become run down.
[3465.80 → 3470.34] Well, that's kind of the opening scene that we have here.
[3471.20 → 3471.42] Right?
[3471.48 → 3474.92] You might imagine the author who is the prophet Jeremiah.
[3475.98 → 3483.22] You might imagine him walking through the streets that used to be vibrant and full of life.
[3484.08 → 3484.64] Right?
[3484.64 → 3486.34] We're living in the city with children at play.
[3487.04 → 3489.18] With people going to and from the marketplace.
[3490.36 → 3494.02] People stopping to chat in the streets with their friends and their neighbours.
[3494.38 → 3497.08] But now the city lies deserted.
[3499.06 → 3503.44] And there would have been the beauty and the grandeur of the temple in Jerusalem.
[3503.44 → 3509.14] And the sounds of worship happening and filling the city with this sound.
[3510.30 → 3514.24] But we find that worship also has been silenced.
[3515.52 → 3522.98] In verse 4, Jeremiah tells us that the roads to Zion mourn for no one comes to her appointed festivals.
[3523.42 → 3525.28] All of her gateways are desolate.
[3525.42 → 3526.62] Her priests groan.
[3526.96 → 3528.24] Her young women grieve.
[3528.56 → 3529.64] And she is in bitter anguish.
[3529.64 → 3534.32] See, Zion is another name for the city of Jerusalem.
[3534.80 → 3540.62] And it's a name that is often used to highlight the religious significance of that city.
[3541.82 → 3548.92] And so when Zion was inhabited by people, when the temple stood in the heart of the city,
[3549.56 → 3558.48] worshippers from all over Israel flocked to Jerusalem three times a year along those roads leading to the city.
[3558.48 → 3558.92] Right?
[3559.76 → 3561.42] And they'd all come to Jerusalem.
[3561.66 → 3563.86] They'd ascend to Mount Zion.
[3564.22 → 3565.44] They'd come to the temple.
[3566.16 → 3570.20] And they would worship the Lord at the appointed feasts and festivals.
[3570.98 → 3573.44] But now the roads are empty.
[3574.14 → 3577.44] Because the temple no longer stands.
[3578.76 → 3580.72] And Zion has been reduced to ashes.
[3581.24 → 3584.12] The majority of the population has been taken into exile.
[3584.12 → 3595.10] The joyful sounds of those young women dancing and singing have been replaced and given way to distress.
[3596.18 → 3597.32] Sounds of grieving.
[3597.32 → 3604.16] But as Jeremiah continues, it gets even worse than that.
[3605.10 → 3605.24] Right?
[3605.28 → 3609.86] It's not simply the silence of worshippers, the destruction of the city.
[3610.08 → 3612.24] Because in verse 6, he writes,
[3612.72 → 3616.38] All the splendour has departed from daughter Zion.
[3616.38 → 3624.38] And the reason why this is the worst description of what happened is that that word splendour or glory,
[3624.78 → 3628.04] it's often used in the scriptures to describe God.
[3628.04 → 3636.14] And so in the former days, when God was present with his people, when his glory filled the temple,
[3636.94 → 3639.36] splendour was bestowed on the city.
[3639.36 → 3647.58] But to say that all splendour has departed tells us that the Lord has withdrawn his glory.
[3648.14 → 3650.32] He has withdrawn his presence from Zion.
[3650.66 → 3652.68] And we read about that in the book of Ezekiel.
[3654.22 → 3663.32] And so the city was so full of life and vibrancy and worship now lies desolate and deserted.
[3663.88 → 3667.06] And this kind of points to the reality of suffering.
[3667.06 → 3675.34] That suffering of any kind that we face often leads to us feeling lonely and deserted.
[3676.40 → 3683.60] And I know many of you here today are well acquainted with this kind of loneliness and suffering.
[3685.32 → 3688.70] You know, maybe sometimes our suffering is very public, is very well-known.
[3690.04 → 3697.00] And when we suffer in this public way, sometimes people kind of recoil or withdraw or retreat from you.
[3697.06 → 3701.34] Or maybe our suffering is secret.
[3702.34 → 3704.66] It's not public, but only we know.
[3705.06 → 3711.96] But it happens in such a way to make us feel like nobody gets us, that nobody understands.
[3713.22 → 3716.40] And so you suffer in lonely silence.
[3717.84 → 3721.00] See, suffering can lead to tears of loneliness.
[3721.00 → 3728.00] But the second thing we see here in Lamentations chapter 1 is tears of betrayal.
[3728.82 → 3731.16] Okay, so not only tears of loneliness, but tears of betrayal.
[3731.72 → 3733.02] So let's look at verse 2.
[3734.78 → 3737.76] Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are on her cheeks.
[3738.50 → 3741.20] Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her.
[3741.60 → 3743.76] All her friends have betrayed her.
[3743.76 → 3745.54] They have become her enemies.
[3747.90 → 3757.34] Now, when that tornado struck the city of Joplin, Missouri, one measure of comfort was that help quickly poured into the city.
[3758.44 → 3758.70] Right?
[3758.78 → 3764.08] There were thousands of emergency workers that flooded into that town within 24 hours.
[3764.08 → 3774.72] And then in the weeks and the months and the years that followed, 180,000 volunteers contributed to the recovery efforts.
[3775.24 → 3783.08] Money was donated from all around the country to help individuals and families and businesses pick up the pieces.
[3783.08 → 3787.78] All of this help came to that community.
[3790.38 → 3796.22] But in the wake of this disaster, the disaster of Jerusalem's destruction, there was no help.
[3798.10 → 3800.42] There were no relief drives.
[3800.98 → 3802.02] No money donated.
[3802.20 → 3806.14] No rescue workers to help Israel.
[3806.14 → 3813.54] In fact, five times in chapter 1, we hear the lament that there was no one to comfort Jerusalem.
[3814.74 → 3817.26] There was only shame and humiliation.
[3818.78 → 3821.34] As her once friends turned away.
[3822.66 → 3831.60] And one of the characteristics about the book of Lamentations is that it is not shy or silent about whose fault all of this suffering is.
[3831.60 → 3836.70] The blame is placed squarely on Israel's shoulders.
[3837.78 → 3840.32] Their suffering came as a result of their sin.
[3840.62 → 3841.60] It was deserved.
[3843.06 → 3847.96] So in verse 5, as one example, Jeremiah just lays it out.
[3848.26 → 3848.48] He says,
[3848.58 → 3852.98] The Lord has brought her grief because of her many sins.
[3853.74 → 3855.10] What were her sins?
[3855.10 → 3866.02] Well, one of the primary metaphors that God uses for his relationship with his people is that of a husband and a lover to his bride.
[3868.08 → 3878.56] And what we see here in verses 1 and 2 is that God's people, though they were meant for a faithful, monogamous union with Yahweh their God,
[3878.76 → 3880.34] they had taken other lovers.
[3881.24 → 3882.92] They had gone after other gods.
[3882.92 → 3885.04] They had made allies with other nations.
[3886.10 → 3892.56] And they betrayed their relationship in unfaithfulness to God.
[3893.50 → 3898.84] And this betrayal now turned inward toward themselves.
[3899.18 → 3907.22] Because when the Babylonian army marched against the gates of Jerusalem, the leaders of the city, of course, they called out for help.
[3907.72 → 3908.58] Come help us.
[3909.58 → 3912.34] They called to their surrounding pagan nations.
[3912.34 → 3918.88] They called out to the pagan gods and goddesses of those nations to save them.
[3920.72 → 3926.56] They called out to all these false lovers whom they had given themselves to,
[3926.72 → 3931.50] all of these things that they looked to for their security, apart from the one true God.
[3931.50 → 3939.14] And all of them either refused to come to their aid or were unable, didn't have the strength to help.
[3939.14 → 3946.92] And so these supposed friends, these false lovers, became their enemies and Israel was betrayed.
[3946.92 → 3955.76] And as we think about that, you know, the question I think I want to invite us to reflect on is whether you and I have done the same thing.
[3955.76 → 3957.76] Right?
[3957.76 → 3958.28] Right?
[3958.34 → 3966.50] So what false lovers, in a sense, do you and I look to for help and security and comfort?
[3967.56 → 3976.10] You know, maybe, you know, whether it's food or drink, whether it is money or a successful career, or any of these things that we look to, some of them good things.
[3976.10 → 3984.68] But the message of chapter 1 is that we were meant for only one lover, the one true God.
[3985.68 → 3987.86] And we were meant for his love for us.
[3989.70 → 3996.96] And so as God's people face the destruction of the city, they weep tears of loneliness, and they weep tears of betrayal.
[3996.96 → 4005.96] In the book of Lamentations, it teaches us to acknowledge the darkness of suffering, the suffering of the world.
[4007.18 → 4012.64] But even as we cry out to God in our distress, we still do so in hope.
[4013.42 → 4014.42] Why can we hope?
[4014.84 → 4025.04] It's because even while we were unfaithful, the God we worship is a God of steadfast love and faithfulness.
[4025.04 → 4027.64] He hears the cries of his people.
[4028.24 → 4032.44] And while we were unfaithful, he remains faithful to his covenant.
[4033.60 → 4042.00] So you see, you know, we don't know exactly where Jeremiah was sitting, Jeremiah the prophet, where he was sitting when he wrote these words.
[4042.90 → 4044.68] But imagine this with me.
[4045.22 → 4049.54] Imagine Jeremiah the prophet sitting just outside the city.
[4050.74 → 4052.02] Now why do I say that?
[4052.02 → 4054.12] Listen to what he writes in verse 12.
[4055.04 → 4058.64] Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
[4059.84 → 4061.02] Look around and see.
[4061.14 → 4068.94] Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the Lord brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?
[4070.12 → 4072.24] See, what he's probably doing is this.
[4072.94 → 4077.64] He's probably, I'm guessing, sitting just outside the city.
[4077.64 → 4084.60] Maybe on a small hill overlooking the city and overlooking the roads that ran right past the city of Jerusalem.
[4085.40 → 4086.80] And there would be travellers.
[4087.04 → 4088.04] These are trade routes.
[4088.82 → 4094.10] There would be travellers on that road passing by, laughing, joking, talking to one another, carrying on.
[4095.10 → 4097.74] Maybe you don't know what happened.
[4097.74 → 4099.48] They just see this pile of ruins.
[4100.00 → 4101.32] Maybe he's been there for some years.
[4102.60 → 4106.12] And Jeremiah sits there, and he says very naturally, very humanly,
[4107.02 → 4110.90] Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
[4111.66 → 4113.42] Don't you see my sorrow?
[4113.42 → 4113.48] Don't you see my sorrow?
[4115.28 → 4120.82] And ultimately, as he says this, he's also saying this to God.
[4122.70 → 4124.42] Because what is Jeremiah doing?
[4124.64 → 4125.76] He is lamenting.
[4126.32 → 4126.44] Right?
[4126.50 → 4134.86] He's bringing his raw, honest confusion, pain, and suffering to God, seeking answers.
[4134.86 → 4141.62] He's saying to the Lord, Is it nothing to you, God?
[4142.84 → 4145.94] Are you passing me by?
[4146.94 → 4148.64] Do you not see our sorrow?
[4149.66 → 4150.90] That's the cry of lament.
[4152.24 → 4156.72] And the answer from God would be slow in coming, but it would come.
[4158.10 → 4162.04] In the voice of God, if Jeremiah was able to hear that voice on that day,
[4162.04 → 4165.88] as he cried out in lament, it would have said this through divine tears,
[4166.54 → 4167.76] It is something to me.
[4168.74 → 4169.96] It is something to me.
[4170.92 → 4174.06] Your suffering is something to me, and I am coming.
[4175.52 → 4180.80] And you see, Jesus would stretch out his arms on the hard wood of that cross,
[4181.28 → 4183.60] and hang, likely where?
[4184.68 → 4189.08] Likely on that same hill overlooking the road outside Jerusalem,
[4189.08 → 4194.08] which hundreds of years later would have come to be called Golgotha.
[4195.52 → 4199.72] And the people walking by would mock and laugh at him.
[4201.34 → 4206.74] And, you know, it kind of makes me wonder if Jesus didn't have Lamentations 1, verse 12,
[4207.32 → 4209.22] on his mind, if not on his lips,
[4209.90 → 4210.66] where he said,
[4210.66 → 4214.12] Is it nothing to you, all who pass by and look and see,
[4214.46 → 4216.36] if there is any suffering like my suffering?
[4217.02 → 4219.90] If there is any sorrow like my sorrow?
[4221.28 → 4225.42] Because Christ was called the man of sorrows.
[4226.78 → 4230.32] And as the one who bore not only his own suffering,
[4230.60 → 4232.86] but the suffering of all of his people,
[4233.60 → 4236.64] no one has ever had sorrow like his sorrow.
[4236.64 → 4243.16] And so, what I want us to see and know and believe here,
[4243.48 → 4249.12] is that our cry of lament is never answered with explanation.
[4251.06 → 4258.46] God doesn't answer our cries and our suffering with, and rationalize.
[4259.34 → 4261.90] He doesn't give us answers for our suffering.
[4262.64 → 4265.34] Rather, he responds with himself.
[4265.34 → 4268.74] He responds with himself, with his presence.
[4269.44 → 4273.92] And so, on the cross, Jesus embodied our lament.
[4274.80 → 4280.16] On the cross, Jesus answers our cries in himself.
[4281.04 → 4281.28] Right?
[4281.38 → 4284.68] We suffer, and he suffers for us.
[4285.68 → 4290.16] We cry out to God, and he cries out to the Father on our behalf.
[4290.30 → 4292.08] And we weep tears of loneliness.
[4292.08 → 4297.78] And on the cross, Jesus, the Father's face was turned away.
[4298.78 → 4299.72] The ultimate loneliness.
[4301.32 → 4304.10] We weep tears of betrayal, and for our sake,
[4304.26 → 4306.46] Jesus was betrayed by his closest friends,
[4306.82 → 4309.38] and died between two traitors.
[4311.78 → 4315.14] Friends, this is the mystery of Christian suffering,
[4315.14 → 4317.20] and of Christian lament.
[4317.20 → 4320.70] That our pain and our prayers are answered,
[4321.18 → 4324.88] not by words, explanations, rationalizations,
[4325.34 → 4327.38] but by the word made flesh.
[4327.88 → 4331.94] By Jesus Christ, the one who came to suffer with us and for us.
[4332.58 → 4334.36] And that's how God answers our suffering.
[4334.36 → 4338.20] And so, as we conclude, let's, I want to just talk about
[4338.20 → 4339.96] two quick points of application.
[4340.90 → 4343.42] So, there's a theologian named John Stott,
[4343.86 → 4345.46] who has since passed away,
[4345.58 → 4347.44] but he wrote this sentence that I've,
[4347.56 → 4349.82] I've seen different places years ago,
[4349.92 → 4351.40] but has stuck with me
[4351.40 → 4354.24] ever since the first time I read it.
[4354.48 → 4355.18] And here it is.
[4355.18 → 4357.46] There are such things, such a thing,
[4357.82 → 4358.94] as Christian tears,
[4359.56 → 4361.26] and too few of us ever weep them.
[4365.82 → 4367.92] What he's saying, I think,
[4368.46 → 4369.90] is that as Christians,
[4370.52 → 4372.52] we are to be people who have tears.
[4373.52 → 4375.24] Not only for ourselves,
[4375.88 → 4377.60] but for others as well.
[4379.44 → 4382.90] And you and I shed those tears in two places.
[4382.90 → 4385.24] First, we shed them in worship.
[4386.12 → 4387.94] And secondly, we shed them in the world.
[4388.94 → 4389.86] So, first in worship,
[4390.36 → 4391.40] lament is meant
[4391.40 → 4394.94] to be a part of our worship together.
[4395.60 → 4396.04] Right?
[4396.10 → 4397.62] Not just a private devotion
[4397.62 → 4400.16] that we do, you know, in our prayers to God.
[4400.42 → 4402.72] So, what I want us to do is invite us
[4402.72 → 4405.80] to resist the tendency that we,
[4406.62 → 4409.44] to think that our grief and our sorrow
[4409.44 → 4411.30] is only a private thing.
[4411.30 → 4413.48] That we have to keep hidden
[4413.48 → 4414.44] from everyone else.
[4414.56 → 4415.42] That is personal.
[4415.98 → 4417.08] It is not personal
[4417.08 → 4421.10] because we are members of one another.
[4422.42 → 4423.64] And so, when we come together
[4423.64 → 4424.84] as a body in worship,
[4425.34 → 4427.44] we bring not only our joy,
[4428.30 → 4429.74] but our tears,
[4430.42 → 4431.08] our sorrow.
[4432.22 → 4434.32] And so, I want to encourage you
[4434.32 → 4436.52] to bring your grief to church.
[4436.52 → 4439.46] Because our worship is communal.
[4439.66 → 4440.32] We're here together.
[4440.46 → 4442.00] We can worship God on our own as well.
[4442.26 → 4443.48] But we're gathered together
[4443.48 → 4446.30] and our lament is communal as well.
[4447.24 → 4448.62] Lament is not something we do alone.
[4450.10 → 4452.08] The second thing is we shed tears
[4452.08 → 4452.98] not only in worship,
[4453.12 → 4454.22] but also in the world.
[4455.64 → 4456.48] And so, here's a question
[4456.48 → 4458.38] I want to ask you
[4458.38 → 4460.00] to take home with you today
[4460.00 → 4460.66] to think about.
[4460.66 → 4462.14] The question is,
[4462.82 → 4463.94] from whom
[4463.94 → 4466.18] that is suffering around me
[4466.18 → 4468.38] have I withheld my tears?
[4469.58 → 4470.66] From whom
[4470.66 → 4473.20] of someone suffering around us
[4473.20 → 4475.56] have we withheld our tears?
[4477.68 → 4477.90] Right?
[4477.96 → 4480.36] One way that we can show Christian love
[4480.36 → 4481.58] to our neighbours,
[4481.78 → 4483.16] whoever those neighbours are,
[4483.82 → 4485.50] is by listening to them,
[4485.84 → 4487.48] by weeping over
[4487.48 → 4489.46] what is not going well with them.
[4489.46 → 4491.46] You know,
[4491.52 → 4492.48] in the Apostle Paul,
[4492.60 → 4493.34] in Romans 12,
[4493.52 → 4495.64] he calls us to weep
[4495.64 → 4496.46] with those who weep.
[4497.86 → 4500.04] In 2 Corinthians 1, verse 4,
[4500.14 → 4500.64] we're called
[4500.64 → 4502.08] to comfort those
[4502.08 → 4502.98] in any trouble
[4502.98 → 4503.58] with the comfort
[4503.58 → 4504.32] we ourselves
[4504.32 → 4505.60] have received from God.
[4507.68 → 4508.20] And so,
[4508.38 → 4510.54] if we are going to be people
[4510.54 → 4512.04] who help bring healing
[4512.04 → 4512.76] to our neighbours,
[4513.42 → 4514.76] or to our town,
[4514.88 → 4516.38] or to our country,
[4516.66 → 4517.52] or to our world,
[4517.90 → 4518.74] it's going to be,
[4518.74 → 4519.48] in part,
[4520.28 → 4521.60] by having tears.
[4522.40 → 4523.36] Extra tears.
[4523.80 → 4524.98] Not only for ourselves,
[4525.38 → 4526.08] but tears
[4526.08 → 4527.68] for our neighbours as well.
[4529.32 → 4530.90] Are we willing to see
[4530.90 → 4531.74] the suffering
[4531.74 → 4532.40] and the sorrow
[4532.40 → 4533.50] of others,
[4534.00 → 4535.14] and to shed tears
[4535.14 → 4535.76] for them,
[4536.04 → 4537.48] because the tears
[4537.48 → 4537.94] of Christ
[4537.94 → 4538.78] were shed for us?
[4540.16 → 4541.38] So let's pray together.
[4541.38 → 4547.92] Lord, we pray
[4547.92 → 4549.52] that in the midst
[4549.52 → 4550.10] of the darkness
[4550.10 → 4551.18] of our own suffering
[4551.18 → 4552.72] and our sorrow,
[4553.58 → 4553.84] and Lord,
[4553.90 → 4554.24] in the midst
[4554.24 → 4555.28] of our own laments
[4555.28 → 4556.00] for the world,
[4556.96 → 4558.02] would you show
[4558.02 → 4558.48] yourself
[4558.48 → 4559.88] to us?
[4560.22 → 4560.98] Would you reveal
[4560.98 → 4562.02] yourself to us?
[4562.74 → 4563.34] Reveal to us
[4563.34 → 4563.94] your light
[4563.94 → 4565.56] and how you came
[4565.56 → 4566.24] to be a light
[4566.24 → 4566.84] in the darkness,
[4566.84 → 4568.36] to heal
[4568.36 → 4569.50] us
[4569.50 → 4570.28] and to restore
[4570.28 → 4571.54] us in the whole world.
[4572.40 → 4573.06] Lord, we pray
[4573.06 → 4573.90] for ourselves,
[4574.54 → 4575.08] all of us
[4575.08 → 4575.52] who lament.
[4576.18 → 4576.90] We pray for
[4576.90 → 4577.62] our neighbours
[4577.62 → 4578.22] who lament,
[4578.78 → 4579.54] and we pray
[4579.54 → 4580.22] for this world
[4580.22 → 4580.90] that laments.
[4581.90 → 4582.70] Would you come,
[4583.84 → 4584.12] and Lord,
[4584.18 → 4584.76] would you heal?
[4584.88 → 4585.54] How long,
[4585.62 → 4586.00] oh Lord?
[4587.78 → 4589.14] We pray in Jesus' name.
[4589.78 → 4590.00] Amen.
[4590.00 → 4590.10] Amen.
[4590.10 → 4590.30] Amen.
[4593.34 → 4593.94] Okay.
[4594.14 → 4594.82] Let's all stand,
[4595.16 → 4596.40] and we will sing
[4596.40 → 4597.22] our song of response.
[4597.22 → 4597.42] Amen.
[4620.10 → 4623.50] I lift my eyes out
[4623.50 → 4626.38] to the mountains,
[4626.90 → 4628.78] where does my help
[4628.78 → 4630.78] come from?
[4632.62 → 4635.38] My help comes from you,
[4635.92 → 4637.98] maker of heaven,
[4639.02 → 4642.94] creator of the earth.
[4644.96 → 4647.86] Oh, how I need you, Lord,
[4647.86 → 4651.26] you are my only love,
[4651.66 → 4655.14] you're my only prayer.
[4657.14 → 4660.30] So, how I need you, Lord,
[4660.30 → 4663.72] to come and rescue me,
[4664.12 → 4668.18] help and give me life.
[4669.96 → 4672.82] I lift my eyes out
[4672.82 → 4675.88] to the mountains,
[4675.88 → 4678.20] where does my help
[4678.20 → 4680.56] come from you.
[4681.90 → 4685.00] My help comes from you,
[4685.56 → 4687.68] maker of heaven,
[4688.62 → 4692.66] creator of the earth.
[4694.26 → 4697.62] Oh, how I need you, Lord,
[4697.62 → 4701.00] you are my only love,
[4701.44 → 4704.56] you're my only prayer.
[4704.56 → 4706.56] So, how I need you, Lord,
[4706.56 → 4710.02] so I will wait for you,
[4710.02 → 4712.72] to come and bless you,
[4712.72 → 4712.74] come and bless you,
[4712.74 → 4718.00] come and give me life.
[4719.30 → 4722.50] I lift my eyes out
[4722.50 → 4725.68] to the mountains,
[4725.68 → 4730.24] where does my help come from?
[4730.24 → 4735.36] my help comes from you,
[4736.02 → 4738.40] maker of heaven,
[4739.40 → 4743.56] creator of the earth.
[4743.56 → 4757.16] So, we come now to the time
[4757.16 → 4757.72] in our worship,
[4757.88 → 4759.24] where we worship the Lord
[4759.24 → 4760.26] through giving of our tithes
[4760.26 → 4760.78] and offerings.
[4761.94 → 4763.02] And today,
[4763.36 → 4764.98] we have two offerings.
[4765.18 → 4765.84] So, first,
[4766.02 → 4766.70] our designated,
[4766.90 → 4767.92] regular designated offering
[4767.92 → 4769.88] is for Delta Christian School.
[4769.88 → 4771.78] In addition,
[4773.34 → 4775.34] we have an additional offering
[4775.34 → 4777.52] for our refugee settlement fund.
[4777.68 → 4777.86] And so,
[4777.98 → 4778.54] John Mantra
[4778.54 → 4780.90] introduced this a bit ago
[4780.90 → 4782.80] that we are hoping
[4782.80 → 4785.16] to sponsor Mule,
[4785.40 → 4786.36] the mother of Duke,
[4786.36 → 4788.48] to come to Canada.
[4789.14 → 4789.72] Now, this is going to be
[4789.72 → 4790.32] a long process.
[4790.60 → 4791.16] There's different
[4791.16 → 4792.80] financial requirements,
[4792.94 → 4794.36] new regulations in place.
[4794.36 → 4797.82] But on behalf of the refugee,
[4798.88 → 4800.36] the new immigrant committee,
[4800.88 → 4802.58] we are going to add funds
[4802.58 → 4804.64] to our refugee settlement fund.
[4805.26 → 4805.58] And so,
[4805.72 → 4806.70] the deacons will come forward,
[4806.80 → 4808.68] pass the offering basket
[4808.68 → 4810.14] or bag,
[4810.58 → 4811.56] the first time
[4811.56 → 4812.64] for Delta Christian School.
[4813.16 → 4813.74] And then,
[4813.88 → 4815.28] there'll be a second passing
[4815.28 → 4818.04] for the refugee settlement fund.
[4821.40 → 4822.52] Pastor Jason
[4822.52 → 4823.94] and some of the worship leaders.
[4824.36 → 4826.06] leadership have wanted
[4826.06 → 4827.18] to introduce a new song
[4827.18 → 4828.32] for the Lent season
[4828.32 → 4830.70] based on Psalm 126.
[4831.24 → 4832.48] The words will be on the screen.
[4832.74 → 4836.32] I'll sing the words.
[4836.74 → 4837.82] You can hum along,
[4838.14 → 4839.94] follow along with just reading
[4839.94 → 4843.48] or sing along Psalm 126.
[4843.48 → 4852.98] Our tongues, they were loosed,
[4852.98 → 4855.48] loosed with joy.
[4855.48 → 4856.90] Our tongues, they were loosed,
[4856.90 → 4869.60] loosed with joy.
[4869.60 → 4875.64] Restore us all.
[4875.64 → 4876.28] Restore us all.
[4878.28 → 4880.66] Restore us all.
[4880.66 → 4882.66] Lord, please do not tell.
[4882.66 → 4886.66] Although we are weeping,
[4886.66 → 4891.66] Lord, help us keep so long.
[4891.66 → 4895.78] Of your kingdom,
[4895.78 → 4900.40] for the day of the week,
[4900.40 → 4902.40] your sheep,
[4902.40 → 4903.22] your sheep,
[4903.22 → 4905.22] we will carry.
[4905.22 → 4909.36] Lord, please do not tell.
[4909.36 → 4914.42] All those who sow in them
[4914.42 → 4916.96] will bow out with arms
[4916.96 → 4919.36] by the way.
[4919.36 → 4930.36] The nations will sing
[4930.36 → 4934.36] He has done great things.
[4936.36 → 4939.64] The nations will sing
[4939.64 → 4942.36] songs of joy.
[4942.36 → 4944.36] Restore us all.
[4944.36 → 4946.36] Restore us all.
[4946.36 → 4948.36] Restore us all.
[4948.36 → 4949.36] Restore us all.
[4949.36 → 4952.36] Restore us all.
[4952.36 → 4954.36] Restore us all.
[4954.36 → 4959.36] Although we are weeping,
[4959.36 → 4963.36] Lord, keep us all.
[4963.36 → 4967.36] The seas of your kingdom,
[4967.36 → 4972.36] for the day of the week,
[4972.36 → 4975.36] your sheep,
[4975.36 → 4977.36] we will carry.
[4977.36 → 4981.36] Lord, please do not tell.
[4981.36 → 4986.36] All those who sow in them
[4986.36 → 4988.36] will bow out with arms
[4988.36 → 4990.36] of joy.
[4990.36 → 4997.36] Although we are weeping,
[4997.36 → 5002.36] Lord, help us keep soaring.
[5002.36 → 5007.36] The seas of your kingdom,
[5007.36 → 5011.36] for the day of the week,
[5011.36 → 5016.36] your sheep, we will carry.
[5016.36 → 5021.36] Lord, please do not tear me.
[5021.36 → 5025.36] All those who sow in them
[5025.36 → 5027.36] will bow out with arms
[5027.36 → 5030.36] of joy.
[5030.36 → 5031.36] Amen.
[5031.36 → 5032.36] Amen.
[5032.36 → 5033.36] Amen.
[5033.36 → 5034.36] Amen.
[5034.36 → 5035.36] Amen.
[5035.36 → 5035.86] Amen.
[5035.86 → 5044.36] And so I love that song,
[5044.36 → 5046.36] and I hope it can kind of be,
[5046.36 → 5049.36] a theme for these next few weeks
[5049.36 → 5051.36] as we in the book of lamentations.
[5051.36 → 5054.36] So let's now go to the Lord
[5054.36 → 5056.36] in prayer together.
[5056.36 → 5057.36] Let's pray together.
[5057.36 → 5063.28] Heavenly Father, you alone know the beginning from the end.
[5064.54 → 5071.66] And Lord, we see but such a tiny fraction of what you are doing in the world and in our lives, how you are working.
[5072.06 → 5074.22] Your ways are far above our ways.
[5075.50 → 5080.78] And so grant us, Lord, diligence to work for the good of our neighbours and for the world.
[5081.28 → 5087.04] That we would go out weeping, sowing, but Lord, that we would reap in joy.
[5088.22 → 5090.56] And we pray, Lord, for the growth of your church.
[5091.46 → 5101.40] But grant us, Lord, the humility to sow and weep and to work with gentleness and kindness, with grace and patience towards others.
[5102.26 → 5106.34] In faith that you are at work, that you are building your kingdom.
[5106.94 → 5108.70] And a kingdom that is not of this world.
[5109.78 → 5115.38] Lord, in the face of so much uncertainty happening in our world,
[5115.38 → 5118.50] we pray for our earthly leaders.
[5119.30 → 5121.90] The ones who know you and the ones who do not.
[5123.24 → 5125.48] We pray that you would turn their hearts towards you.
[5126.14 → 5132.22] That you would lead them to make wise decisions that promote order and justice and human flourishing.
[5132.22 → 5138.06] And ultimately, that your church around the world would be able to worship you in freedom and in truth.
[5139.74 → 5141.98] Lord, we pray for the church here in Ladder.
[5142.38 → 5150.30] We pray that your word would be faithfully proclaimed in this city on Sunday mornings and throughout the week by the power of your spirit.
[5150.30 → 5157.08] We pray that your people in this city would, by your help, Lord, reflect your glory in both word and deed.
[5157.94 → 5163.28] And that many, Lord, would continue to be drawn to the good news of your gospel.
[5163.28 → 5167.08] We lift to you, Father Delta Christian School.
[5167.88 → 5172.20] We pray that your name would be faithfully proclaimed to each student day by day.
[5173.04 → 5176.18] Would you bless and encourage staff and teachers?
[5177.30 → 5182.98] Would you build the kind of rich community at that school that only you can bring?
[5183.94 → 5189.56] We ask that you would meet their financial needs as they continue to grow and expand.
[5189.88 → 5192.70] Lord, so that your glory may be manifest in Delta.
[5192.70 → 5199.82] Lord, we pray for Duke's mom.
[5200.52 → 5206.60] And Lord, we pray that if it is your will, that you would grant her safe passage and welcome to come to Canada.
[5207.10 → 5209.68] Lord, we pray that it would happen sooner than later.
[5210.80 → 5213.92] And Lord, that while we wait, we would put our hope in you.
[5215.14 → 5220.52] Finally, Lord, we continue to pray for the families and friends of Grace Krista and Connie Graham,
[5220.52 → 5225.04] who are now in your presence beholding you face to face in glory.
[5225.70 → 5232.22] Lord, we praise you that they are with you, that they are both your daughters through Christ.
[5232.78 → 5237.14] And we ask, Lord, that you would grant great comfort and hope to all those who mourn.
[5238.14 → 5242.22] We ask that you would be with Michael Wayne as well in his battle with cancer.
[5242.22 → 5248.00] We ask that you would grant him comfort and hope.
[5248.84 → 5255.54] We pray that you would help the doctors to know the best way to provide care and treatment for him.
[5256.40 → 5259.58] We thank you, Lord, that you are the God who is with us.
[5259.58 → 5265.68] And Father, we pray that the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding,
[5265.82 → 5270.84] that surpasses all of our circumstances and our situations, that is greater than our sorrows,
[5271.46 → 5273.60] would guard all of our hearts and minds.
[5274.48 → 5276.12] We pray this in Christ's name.
[5276.72 → 5276.94] Amen.
[5278.50 → 5279.06] All right.
[5279.12 → 5282.92] Let's all stand, and we will go out with God's blessing.
[5282.92 → 5289.32] So I invite you to join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship halls right after the service.
[5289.48 → 5295.56] And again, this afternoon at 2 o'clock, Mountain View Manor singing and Wednesday, Congregational meeting.
[5296.18 → 5300.46] So I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5301.02 → 5302.64] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5302.86 → 5305.84] The Lord make his face to shine on you and be gracious to you.
[5305.92 → 5309.04] The Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[5309.46 → 5309.72] Amen.
[5309.72 → 5309.78] Amen.
[5312.92 → 5331.48] Be the peace of our heavenly Father,
[5331.48 → 5337.08] and the grace of Christ that leads in time,
[5337.08 → 5343.08] And the affection of God the Spirit,
[5343.74 → 5348.68] Weep our hearts and minds within his life.
[5349.46 → 5354.92] And to him, he prays for his glorious friend,
[5355.26 → 5360.42] From the depths of the world to the heights of heaven,
[5360.78 → 5366.04] We declare the name of the Lamb of Son,
[5366.04 → 5367.04] Christ eternal,
[5367.04 → 5368.04] Christ eternal,
[5368.04 → 5371.04] The King of King.
[5371.04 → 5382.36] Be this peace,
[5382.36 → 5384.36] He has his understanding,
[5384.36 → 5385.36] And this grace,
[5385.36 → 5387.36] And this grace,
[5387.36 → 5391.36] Which matters what we are,
[5391.36 → 5396.36] And this fellowship of his communion,
[5396.36 → 5402.36] He must form the Spirit and his heart.
[5402.36 → 5419.68] And this grace,
[5419.68 → 5426.06] Christ eternal, the King of kings.
[5426.06 → 5431.64] Christ eternal, the King of kings.
[5449.68 → 5459.68] Christ eternal, the King of kings.
