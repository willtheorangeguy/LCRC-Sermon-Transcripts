[460.96 → 462.96] Thank you.
[462.96 → 464.96] You may be seated.
[464.96 → 468.96] So, good morning everyone.
[468.96 → 471.96] And welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[471.96 → 475.96] Thank you so much for coming, for gathering with us today.
[475.96 → 478.96] For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jason True.
[478.96 → 481.96] I'm the pastor here at Lanner Christian Reformed Church.
[481.96 → 485.96] And I'm grateful to be here with you in this time.
[485.96 → 493.96] And so we are gathered here today to praise God and to thank him for the life of our sister in Christ,
[493.96 → 495.96] Grace Costa.
[495.96 → 496.96] Grace Costa.
[496.96 → 500.96] And we also come together to look to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[500.96 → 506.96] Because he is the one who comforts us in our grief.
[506.96 → 509.96] And he is the one in whom we put our hope.
[509.96 → 512.96] And the hope of the promises of the gospel.
[512.96 → 518.96] And so as we begin our time of worship today, let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[518.96 → 519.96] Would you please pray with me?
[519.96 → 526.96] Heavenly Father, we praise you because you are the giver of all life.
[526.96 → 531.96] You, O Lord, are sovereign over all of our days.
[531.96 → 538.96] You appoint our waking and our sleeping, our birth and our death.
[538.96 → 545.96] And all of these things, Lord, are according to your grace and your good purposes.
[545.96 → 548.96] And we thank you, Lord, for Grace Costa.
[548.96 → 558.96] A wife, a mother, a grandmother, a friend, and a dear sister in Christ who is loved by all of us here.
[558.96 → 562.96] Thank you, Lord, for the good gift of giving her to us.
[562.96 → 565.96] Lord, we give you praise and thanks.
[565.96 → 569.96] And we ask now that you would receive our worship.
[569.96 → 572.96] That you would meet each of us where we are.
[572.96 → 575.96] That you would comfort us in our sorrow.
[575.96 → 578.96] That you would remind us of your goodness and your grace.
[578.96 → 581.96] And of the hope that we have in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[581.96 → 586.96] The Lord Jesus who conquered death and offers us life in his name.
[586.96 → 593.96] And it is in that name, the name of Jesus Christ, that we pray. Amen.
[593.96 → 599.96] So as we begin our time of remembrance, our time of worship this morning,
[599.96 → 603.96] let's hear these promises of God in his word.
[603.96 → 608.96] I will read a few verses of scripture for you.
[608.96 → 611.96] In Psalm 121, the psalmist proclaims,
[611.96 → 615.96] I lift my eyes to the mountains.
[615.96 → 617.96] Where does my help come from?
[617.96 → 623.96] My help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[623.96 → 626.96] Jesus said,
[626.96 → 629.96] My Father's house has many rooms.
[629.96 → 635.96] If that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
[635.96 → 642.96] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me,
[642.96 → 647.96] that you also may be where I am.
[647.96 → 650.96] The apostle Paul writes in Ephesians,
[650.96 → 655.96] Because of his great love for us, God who is rich in mercy,
[655.96 → 659.96] made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions.
[659.96 → 662.96] It is by grace you have been saved.
[662.96 → 670.96] And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.
[670.96 → 675.96] Finally, King David proclaims his trust in the Lord in Psalm 23.
[675.96 → 676.96] He says,
[676.96 → 680.96] Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life,
[680.96 → 683.96] and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[683.96 → 686.96] And so let's all stand.
[686.96 → 692.96] We're going to sing a couple songs that were especially meaningful to grace this morning.
[692.96 → 694.96] Please stand, and we'll sing our first song together.
[694.96 → 697.96] And the words will be on the screens here.
[697.96 → 707.96] And the words will be on the screens here.
[707.96 → 712.96] And the words will be on the screens here.
[712.96 → 714.96] Amen.
[742.96 → 744.96] Amen.
[772.96 → 774.96] Amen.
[802.96 → 804.96] Amen.
[832.96 → 834.96] Amen.
[862.96 → 864.96] Amen.
[892.96 → 894.96] Amen.
[922.96 → 924.96] Amen.
[952.96 → 954.96] Amen.
[982.96 → 984.96] Amen.
[984.96 → 986.96] Amen.
[986.96 → 988.96] Amen.
[988.96 → 990.96] Amen.
[990.96 → 992.96] Amen.
[992.96 → 994.96] Amen.
[994.96 → 996.96] Amen.
[996.96 → 998.96] Amen.
[998.96 → 1000.96] You may be seated.
[1000.96 → 1002.96] I didn't...
[1002.96 → 1010.96] I didn't know Grace all that well when I came here to be pastored of the church.
[1010.96 → 1015.96] You know, she was already pretty much at home, not able to come very easily to church.
[1015.96 → 1021.96] And when the times when I went to visit her, she's always gracious and appreciated the visits.
[1021.96 → 1028.96] Sometimes, you know, I'm not much of a conversationalist, and she was fairly quiet lady, like herself.
[1028.96 → 1036.96] But, you know, sometimes we would get having some discussions and talking about her life and coming from Holland.
[1036.96 → 1039.96] Her life just being, growing up in Ladder and her family.
[1039.96 → 1050.96] And other times, when maybe the conversation wasn't happening that day, either way, she would always be so quick and willing,
[1050.96 → 1052.96] when I said, can we read a passage of scripture?
[1052.96 → 1053.96] Can we pray?
[1053.96 → 1055.96] That, yeah, she really engaged with that.
[1055.96 → 1062.96] And especially some of the last times I saw her, and I said, you know, can we pray?
[1062.96 → 1066.96] Even if she really wasn't... I wasn't sure if she wanted me there at all.
[1066.96 → 1069.96] Well, you know, as we all get old, and I wouldn't either.
[1069.96 → 1078.96] But she very quickly folded her hands, and yes, you know, she was very willing to come to the Lord in prayer.
[1078.96 → 1080.96] And she had a very quiet and confident faith.
[1080.96 → 1088.96] And a smile, you know, very kind of, sometimes kind of serious, but sometimes, especially talking about the Lord,
[1088.96 → 1090.96] she'd crack a smile on her face.
[1090.96 → 1091.96] That was a beautiful thing.
[1091.96 → 1100.96] We're going to see a slideshow that the families put together, some photos of Grace and family and friends throughout the years.
[1100.96 → 1103.96] And so let's watch that right now.
[1103.96 → 1130.96] I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk by your side.
[1130.96 → 1136.96] I can only imagine what my eyes will see
[1136.96 → 1142.66] When your face is before me
[1142.66 → 1145.58] I can only imagine
[1145.58 → 1158.74] Surrounded by your glory
[1158.74 → 1161.86] What will my heart feel?
[1162.18 → 1164.74] Will I dance for you, Jesus?
[1165.18 → 1167.86] Or in awe of you be still
[1167.86 → 1170.92] Will I stand in your presence?
[1171.32 → 1173.64] Or to my knees will I fall?
[1174.12 → 1176.64] Will I sing hallelujah?
[1177.16 → 1179.72] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1179.82 → 1181.96] I can only imagine
[1181.96 → 1187.22] I can only imagine
[1188.74 → 1193.64] I can only imagine
[1193.64 → 1196.94] When that day comes
[1196.94 → 1199.94] And I find myself
[1199.94 → 1202.74] Standing in the sun
[1202.74 → 1205.62] I can only imagine
[1205.62 → 1208.86] When all I would do
[1208.86 → 1211.22] Is forever
[1211.22 → 1214.84] Forever worship you
[1214.84 → 1217.42] I can only imagine
[1217.42 → 1218.20] Yeah
[1218.20 → 1223.42] I can only imagine
[1223.42 → 1230.12] Surrounded by your glory
[1230.12 → 1233.12] What will my heart feel?
[1233.12 → 1236.12] Will I dance for you, Jesus?
[1236.12 → 1239.24] Or in awe of you be still
[1239.24 → 1241.32] Will I stand in your presence?
[1241.32 → 1243.24] Or to my knees will I fall?
[1243.24 → 1245.24] Will I sing hallelujah?
[1245.24 → 1247.24] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1247.24 → 1248.24] Hallelujah
[1248.24 → 1251.14] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1251.14 → 1252.14] I can only imagine
[1252.14 → 1253.14] I can only imagine
[1253.14 → 1254.14] I can only imagine
[1254.14 → 1255.44] Yeah
[1255.44 → 1263.34] I can only imagine
[1263.34 → 1266.64] Surrounded by your glory
[1266.64 → 1267.64] What will my heart feel?
[1267.64 → 1268.64] What will my heart feel?
[1268.64 → 1269.64] What will my heart feel?
[1269.64 → 1272.64] Will I dance for you, Jesus?
[1272.64 → 1275.64] What will you be still?
[1275.64 → 1278.64] Will I stand in your presence?
[1278.64 → 1281.64] Or to my knees will I fall?
[1281.64 → 1284.64] Will I sing hallelujah?
[1284.64 → 1286.64] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1286.64 → 1287.64] Will I be able to speak at all?
[1287.64 → 1289.64] I can only imagine
[1289.64 → 1291.64] Yeah
[1291.64 → 1295.64] I can only imagine
[1295.64 → 1301.64] I can only imagine
[1301.64 → 1303.64] Yeah
[1303.64 → 1307.64] I can only imagine
[1307.64 → 1313.64] I can only imagine
[1313.64 → 1320.64] I can only imagine
[1320.64 → 1328.64] I can only imagine
[1328.64 → 1331.64] When all I would do
[1331.64 → 1334.64] Is forever
[1334.64 → 1337.64] Forever worship you
[1337.64 → 1347.64] I can only imagine
[1347.64 → 1348.64] I can only imagine
[1348.64 → 1352.64] I can only imagine
[1352.64 → 1371.90] Let's all rise, and we'll sing another hymn together, Abide With Me.
[1382.64 → 1384.64] Amen.
[1412.64 → 1414.64] Amen.
[1442.64 → 1444.64] Amen.
[1472.64 → 1474.64] Amen.
[1502.64 → 1504.64] Amen.
[1532.64 → 1534.64] Amen.
[1562.64 → 1564.64] Amen.
[1592.64 → 1594.64] Amen.
[1594.64 → 1596.64] Amen.
[1596.64 → 1597.64] Amen.
[1597.64 → 1598.64] Amen.
[1598.64 → 1599.64] Amen.
[1599.64 → 1601.64] Amen.
[1601.64 → 1602.64] Amen.
[1602.64 → 1617.64] So we're going to read a passage from the Bible as a way to guide us in our thinking
[1617.64 → 1621.64] and our remembering of the life of Grace Krista.
[1621.64 → 1624.26] Grace was a dear friend to all of us here.
[1624.58 → 1626.22] She loved her family and friends.
[1626.38 → 1628.18] She loved her church family.
[1629.22 → 1632.26] And it was very evident by the way she lived her life,
[1632.82 → 1636.64] though sinner, sinner though she was, just like all of us are,
[1637.38 → 1640.58] that her hope and her faith were in Jesus.
[1641.76 → 1645.20] And so we're going to read this passage from 1 Peter 1.
[1645.44 → 1647.04] We'll read verses 3 to 9.
[1648.00 → 1649.48] And I want us to think about this together.
[1649.48 → 1651.18] The words will be on the screen.
[1651.64 → 1653.02] And I will read it for us.
[1654.10 → 1657.78] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1658.34 → 1663.72] In his great mercy, he has given us a new birth into a living hope
[1663.72 → 1666.96] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[1666.96 → 1671.90] and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[1672.68 → 1675.22] This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,
[1675.82 → 1678.42] who through faith are shielded by God's power
[1678.42 → 1683.62] until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[1683.62 → 1686.42] In all this, you greatly rejoice,
[1686.76 → 1691.62] though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[1691.62 → 1697.66] These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith,
[1697.66 → 1702.20] of greater worse than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire,
[1702.70 → 1708.70] may result in praise, glory, and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[1708.70 → 1712.60] Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[1712.92 → 1716.02] And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him
[1716.02 → 1719.74] and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy.
[1720.08 → 1723.24] For you are receiving the end result of your faith,
[1723.88 → 1725.80] the salvation of your souls.
[1725.80 → 1727.70] This is the word of the Lord.
[1728.14 → 1729.22] Thanks be to God.
[1730.10 → 1732.10] Let's pray as we come before God's word.
[1733.76 → 1735.58] O Lord, we thank you for your word,
[1735.72 → 1738.38] which is absolutely true and given to us in love.
[1739.38 → 1742.50] Guide us, we pray, O Lord, by your Holy Spirit,
[1743.28 → 1747.40] so that here now in this time we might receive hope
[1747.40 → 1751.16] and that we might receive comfort by your truth.
[1751.62 → 1753.62] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1753.84 → 1754.14] Amen.
[1754.14 → 1754.24] Amen.
[1755.80 → 1759.78] So to me, this passage is a great overview
[1759.78 → 1762.98] of what it really means to be a Christian
[1762.98 → 1767.42] and particularly the Christian view of death.
[1768.16 → 1771.84] And we can't help but think about that right now.
[1773.02 → 1776.96] Death is on our minds because that is why we're here.
[1777.68 → 1782.46] Someone dear to us, someone we loved and who loved us has died.
[1782.46 → 1785.60] And we are reminded of that,
[1785.92 → 1789.30] but we are also reminded too of the fact
[1789.30 → 1792.64] that that's going to happen to all of us.
[1793.64 → 1795.72] You know, and people sometimes wonder,
[1796.44 → 1798.16] well, why do people die?
[1798.16 → 1801.88] The Bible gives us an answer.
[1802.00 → 1806.24] According to the Bible, death was not part of God's good creation.
[1806.44 → 1809.20] There's nothing natural about death.
[1809.20 → 1813.88] But because of sin, death came into the world.
[1814.38 → 1815.02] Right?
[1815.08 → 1819.44] Our first parents, Adam and Eve, so long ago, they rejected God.
[1819.54 → 1821.22] They decided to go their own way.
[1821.22 → 1828.06] And we inherited Adam's sinful nature,
[1828.28 → 1831.22] which means that spiritually and relationally,
[1831.92 → 1834.90] we are separated from the God who made us.
[1835.04 → 1839.36] And it means physically that our bodies decay and die.
[1839.36 → 1845.44] That is the situation of every single one of us here this morning.
[1845.86 → 1848.26] And so then what is the answer to death?
[1848.62 → 1852.76] What is the hope that we can have in the face of death?
[1853.32 → 1856.48] What do you believe happens when you die?
[1858.46 → 1862.38] Well, from this passage, there are two words,
[1863.00 → 1866.12] two very important words found here
[1866.12 → 1869.08] that explain the Christian view of death.
[1869.90 → 1873.34] It doesn't tell us everything that the Bible says about death.
[1873.36 → 1878.20] And it doesn't answer all the questions that we might have about death.
[1878.60 → 1881.38] But it tells us things that we need to know.
[1882.34 → 1884.82] And it's based on these two words here.
[1884.94 → 1887.80] So we're going to look at these two words briefly this morning.
[1888.10 → 1890.02] The first word is hope.
[1891.24 → 1897.58] The apostle Peter, he talks here about the hope that God alone can give.
[1897.58 → 1901.76] So if you look again with me at verse 3, he writes this.
[1902.72 → 1905.64] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1906.56 → 1908.60] It opens with this word of praise.
[1908.86 → 1909.16] Why?
[1909.62 → 1916.22] Because in his great mercy, he has given us a new birth into a living hope
[1916.22 → 1919.60] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[1919.60 → 1923.14] So we are born into a living hope.
[1923.14 → 1930.72] And the thing is, as we go throughout life, we carry all kinds of hopes in our hearts.
[1931.94 → 1938.06] You know, from our very little, you know, we might have the hope of seeing our best friend
[1938.06 → 1940.62] out on the playground in kindergarten.
[1940.62 → 1948.94] As we get older, we might have the hope of going on that first date or getting onto the sports team
[1948.94 → 1952.76] or, you know, getting a good grade on a test at school.
[1954.60 → 1960.48] Then as we grow older, we hope that we'll get that job or later get a promotion, perhaps.
[1960.48 → 1964.98] We might hope that we'll get married and that our marriage will hold together.
[1965.62 → 1970.06] We might hope that we have kids and that those kids will grow up to be happy
[1970.06 → 1974.30] and protected from all the, you know, the most serious troubles of life.
[1975.40 → 1977.84] You know, as people, we live our lives by hope.
[1979.02 → 1981.30] Hope is what gives meaning to our lives.
[1981.38 → 1984.22] Without hope, our lives kind of lose their purpose.
[1984.22 → 1991.28] So, what is your hope for when you die?
[1992.42 → 1992.66] Right?
[1992.76 → 1994.60] Which all of us, again, will do someday.
[1995.58 → 1998.50] And where does that hope to come from for the Christian?
[1999.28 → 2001.38] This Christian living hope that we have?
[2001.86 → 2006.88] Well, it's not based on wishful thinking that everything will kind of work out okay in the end.
[2007.14 → 2008.08] Whatever that means.
[2009.66 → 2010.76] Peter says,
[2010.76 → 2015.30] Because God has given us a new birth into a living hope.
[2015.70 → 2016.32] A new birth.
[2016.38 → 2020.08] Remember, because of sin, we are spiritually dead.
[2020.58 → 2023.42] We are spiritually, we're cut off from God, the creator of life.
[2024.18 → 2027.62] But Peter says, through faith in him, we have this new birth.
[2028.26 → 2031.26] Just like as Jesus told Nicodemus in the Gospel of John,
[2031.34 → 2033.02] we have a new, we're born again.
[2033.02 → 2035.76] We have this new birth into a living hope.
[2037.08 → 2039.20] And this is something that only God can do.
[2039.20 → 2042.16] Only God can do that in our hearts.
[2043.12 → 2045.26] And then, what is the basis for this hope?
[2045.64 → 2049.90] Peter says, it's because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[2051.28 → 2055.30] So, this hope that we have is based on a historical fact in reality.
[2055.30 → 2059.42] It's based on the fact that Jesus died on that cross.
[2059.90 → 2063.04] That he paid for the sins of all of his people.
[2063.56 → 2065.38] He suffered the wrath of God for us.
[2065.44 → 2069.66] And then he rose from the dead, conquering death itself.
[2069.66 → 2073.48] And because Jesus has conquered death,
[2073.62 → 2077.64] everybody who is united to Jesus by faith,
[2078.12 → 2080.92] also will conquer death.
[2081.92 → 2085.64] His resurrection guarantees our resurrection.
[2085.64 → 2091.76] Then he goes on and tells us in verse 4 that we have an inheritance.
[2092.80 → 2095.70] He writes, we have this living hope into an inheritance
[2095.70 → 2098.76] that can never perish or spoil or fade.
[2099.10 → 2101.72] It's an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you.
[2101.72 → 2109.84] Are you expecting an inheritance from someone in your family?
[2110.04 → 2110.92] You know, when they die,
[2111.10 → 2115.82] their will is going to reveal that maybe you have inherited something.
[2116.54 → 2118.14] You know, sometimes it's a rocking chair.
[2119.18 → 2121.60] Sometimes it's 50 acres of farmland.
[2122.68 → 2124.26] Whatever it is, though,
[2125.30 → 2126.68] that is not going to last either.
[2126.68 → 2132.90] But look at what Paul says about our inheritance in Christ.
[2133.00 → 2135.94] In contrast to all the earthly things we might inherit,
[2136.78 → 2142.26] our inheritance in Christ can never perish or spoil or fade.
[2143.48 → 2147.14] It's not an inheritance that's based on, let's say, like the stock market.
[2147.70 → 2147.84] Right?
[2147.98 → 2151.08] Maybe you inherit all of these shares of stock,
[2151.16 → 2153.60] then the stock market goes south,
[2153.60 → 2156.90] and your inheritance kind of just slips away.
[2158.20 → 2161.56] But that is not going to be the case for the Christian.
[2161.92 → 2165.82] When the Christian dies, the inheritance is there.
[2166.46 → 2167.86] And nothing can change that.
[2168.00 → 2169.10] Nothing can take it away.
[2170.98 → 2174.18] And that is what grace had her hope in.
[2174.92 → 2175.82] That inheritance.
[2176.62 → 2179.14] And it's an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you.
[2179.74 → 2179.92] Right?
[2179.96 → 2180.44] I love that.
[2180.44 → 2182.30] We have a reservation.
[2183.60 → 2186.04] We read earlier at the start of the service,
[2186.22 → 2186.82] Jesus said,
[2187.28 → 2189.08] I am going to prepare a place for you.
[2189.32 → 2193.04] And I'm going to take you to be with me,
[2193.10 → 2194.68] that you may be where I am.
[2194.94 → 2197.02] We have a place reserved,
[2197.86 → 2198.50] this inheritance.
[2200.28 → 2203.30] And so, friends, that is our hope if you know Jesus Christ.
[2203.80 → 2206.74] Because of what Jesus has done for you in his death,
[2207.28 → 2208.50] in his resurrection,
[2208.66 → 2209.72] that conquered sin,
[2210.56 → 2212.36] that vanquished death,
[2212.36 → 2214.90] and then through faith in him,
[2214.96 → 2217.28] you can be born again into a living hope.
[2218.24 → 2219.62] And it's reserved for you,
[2219.68 → 2221.90] and it's kept by God for you.
[2221.98 → 2223.42] There's nothing you can do to lose it,
[2223.52 → 2224.38] or mess it up.
[2224.58 → 2225.44] It cannot break.
[2225.90 → 2226.64] It is yours.
[2227.10 → 2228.72] Not because of anything you have done,
[2229.08 → 2230.08] but simply through faith.
[2231.20 → 2232.42] Do you have that hope?
[2232.80 → 2234.62] This is the hope that Grace Coaster had.
[2234.62 → 2239.98] And then the second word for us is faith.
[2241.08 → 2241.52] Right?
[2241.56 → 2244.00] We have this hope that God alone can give,
[2244.68 → 2248.12] and then we have a faith that leads us home,
[2248.78 → 2252.78] that leads us to this inheritance that is promised.
[2252.78 → 2256.78] And so, in the last two verses of our passage,
[2256.92 → 2257.92] verses 8 and 9,
[2258.20 → 2259.02] Peter says this,
[2259.02 → 2279.76] So what Peter is talking about here,
[2279.76 → 2281.94] is the outcome,
[2282.26 → 2284.78] the result of putting our faith in Jesus,
[2284.96 → 2286.72] and that is our salvation.
[2287.90 → 2289.76] And he says something very important.
[2290.84 → 2291.50] He says,
[2291.88 → 2293.74] You can't see God right now,
[2293.90 → 2296.44] but you will see him.
[2297.16 → 2298.74] You can't see him right now,
[2298.84 → 2299.84] but you will.
[2300.52 → 2302.30] Have any of you ever seen God?
[2303.52 → 2304.58] Of course not.
[2304.58 → 2306.66] For a very simple reason.
[2307.10 → 2307.84] God is a spirit,
[2308.08 → 2311.20] and has not a body like men and women.
[2312.38 → 2313.32] And so you may wonder,
[2313.52 → 2316.26] Well, it sure would be helpful.
[2317.06 → 2320.14] It sure would help me a lot if I could see God.
[2321.10 → 2323.06] I might then believe in him,
[2323.90 → 2325.96] but then it wouldn't be by faith.
[2327.70 → 2330.72] And faith, it doesn't mean wishful thinking,
[2331.22 → 2333.34] which is sometimes what we think it means.
[2333.34 → 2336.48] You know, faith means trust.
[2337.24 → 2340.68] It's trusting in God for who he is,
[2341.08 → 2343.02] and because he has spoken to us,
[2343.08 → 2345.32] he has revealed himself to us,
[2345.56 → 2348.00] especially in his word, the Bible.
[2349.08 → 2351.22] So after Jesus rose from the dead,
[2351.48 → 2352.46] you know, one time,
[2352.74 → 2354.46] he appeared to all of his disciples,
[2355.26 → 2357.70] and they saw him alive again
[2357.70 → 2359.68] in his resurrected glory in his body.
[2360.16 → 2362.16] But one of the disciples, Thomas,
[2362.16 → 2364.48] he wasn't there.
[2365.30 → 2369.58] And he still doubted that Jesus really rose from the dead.
[2369.80 → 2370.88] I mean, it's kind of unbelievable.
[2372.24 → 2374.84] So Jesus shows up again the next day.
[2375.04 → 2375.76] Thomas is there,
[2375.90 → 2377.12] and he walks in,
[2377.16 → 2377.56] and he said,
[2377.64 → 2378.58] Here I am.
[2379.44 → 2381.14] And Thomas said,
[2381.82 → 2383.52] My Lord and my God.
[2383.52 → 2386.14] Jesus responded,
[2386.42 → 2389.24] Do you believe in me just because you can see me?
[2390.08 → 2393.64] Blessed are those who haven't seen me and yet believe.
[2395.00 → 2395.52] Right?
[2395.56 → 2398.16] You don't have to see God with your physical eyes
[2398.16 → 2400.48] to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2400.48 → 2403.12] But of course,
[2403.24 → 2406.26] there is the fact that we will see God one day.
[2406.94 → 2409.14] Right now, we walk by faith,
[2409.60 → 2411.96] trusting in God's promises to us,
[2412.40 → 2414.94] and yet the day will come at the resurrection
[2414.94 → 2416.80] when we are glorified,
[2417.52 → 2418.56] and we are perfected,
[2418.62 → 2420.08] having gone through these trials,
[2420.26 → 2421.32] purified by fire,
[2421.66 → 2422.00] body,
[2422.26 → 2422.84] and soul,
[2422.84 → 2425.72] and we will see the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2426.64 → 2428.98] Faith will give way to sight.
[2430.00 → 2432.46] It will be a spiritual sight and a physical sight.
[2433.64 → 2438.62] And our sister Grace is already enjoying that sight right now.
[2439.82 → 2440.90] And we will too.
[2441.52 → 2444.80] If we understand our dreadful, sinful condition,
[2445.12 → 2448.08] our desperate need for a new heart and a new life
[2448.08 → 2449.56] that only God can give.
[2449.56 → 2453.04] And God has revealed himself to us.
[2453.24 → 2454.80] He tells us that he loves us.
[2455.16 → 2457.54] He tells us that he died for us on that cross,
[2457.80 → 2460.50] and that he rose again for us, conquering death.
[2461.18 → 2463.68] And now the choice for us is,
[2463.98 → 2466.34] will I accept that invitation?
[2468.76 → 2472.18] If we want to have a living hope
[2472.18 → 2476.46] and a faith that assures us of life beyond the grave,
[2476.46 → 2478.42] the only way to get that
[2478.42 → 2481.14] is through a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[2481.36 → 2482.48] He has done it all.
[2484.44 → 2486.72] And he offers us this life.
[2487.18 → 2489.92] In grace, we know from her own testimony,
[2490.22 → 2494.34] she's accepted what Jesus has done for her.
[2495.08 → 2497.02] And we come to Jesus as we are,
[2497.06 → 2498.88] with all of our sin, all of our struggles,
[2499.36 → 2501.42] but we just accept what he has done.
[2501.98 → 2503.48] And he makes us children of God.
[2503.48 → 2506.34] And he assures us that we will see him in glory.
[2507.28 → 2510.94] So let's pray, and let's trust in the Lord.
[2512.68 → 2515.48] Heavenly Father, we give thanks to you today
[2515.48 → 2518.08] for the blessing that you have granted all of us
[2518.08 → 2521.58] in different ways of knowing, loving,
[2521.98 → 2525.00] and being known and loved by your servant, Grace Costa.
[2525.00 → 2528.26] But most of all, Lord, we thank you
[2528.26 → 2530.78] that we do not have to fear death
[2530.78 → 2533.98] because Christ is the one who has conquered death.
[2534.56 → 2537.96] And he is the one who will enable us
[2537.96 → 2539.44] to conquer it as well.
[2540.08 → 2542.14] Thank you, Lord, for the hope that the gospel
[2542.14 → 2543.96] provides for us and the faith
[2543.96 → 2547.76] that you enable us to express in trusting you
[2547.76 → 2549.16] all the way through this life
[2549.16 → 2552.56] until we see you face to face in glory.
[2552.56 → 2554.48] Hear us as we pray, O Lord.
[2554.94 → 2556.20] In Jesus' name, amen.
[2558.54 → 2561.02] So in response to God's word, let's all stand
[2561.02 → 2562.84] and we're going to sing Amazing Grace,
[2563.06 → 2564.66] a well-known and well-loved hymn.
[2564.66 → 2574.44] Amazing Grace, the sweetest time,
[2574.44 → 2580.04] and take the land for you.
[2580.04 → 2588.40] Amazing Grace, the sweetest time,
[2588.40 → 2594.40] and take the land for you.
[2594.40 → 2602.68] I once was lost, but now I'm blind,
[2602.68 → 2608.64] but now I see.
[2608.64 → 2615.36] He comes along.
[2615.36 → 2616.48] Amen.
[2616.48 → 2618.36] That fresh and Corrie memorable
[2618.36 → 2624.90] and grace of His protégé aspects
[2624.90 → 2628.06] are the fact that He is ready to share with the God
[2628.06 → 2628.78] that He is good in great John
[2628.78 → 2630.42] and this bug 위해서 by Christ
[2630.62 → 2631.32] and He withers who builds
[2631.32 → 2634.08] by chronicler manifesting
[2634.08 → 2664.06] Thank you.
[2664.08 → 2694.06] Thank you.
[2694.08 → 2696.08] Thank you.
[2724.08 → 2726.08] Thank you.
[2726.08 → 2728.08] Thank you.
[2728.08 → 2730.08] Thank you.
[2730.08 → 2732.08] Thank you.
[2732.08 → 2734.08] Thank you.
[2734.08 → 2736.08] Thank you.
[2736.08 → 2738.08] Thank you.
[2738.08 → 2740.08] Thank you.
[2740.08 → 2742.08] Thank you.
[2742.08 → 2744.08] Thank you.
[2744.08 → 2746.08] Thank you.
[2746.08 → 2748.08] Thank you.
[2748.08 → 2750.08] Thank you.
[2750.08 → 2752.08] Thank you.
[2752.08 → 2754.08] Thank you.
[2754.08 → 2756.08] Thank you.
[2756.08 → 2758.08] Thank you.
[2758.08 → 2760.08] Thank you.
[2760.08 → 2762.08] Thank you.
[2762.08 → 2764.08] Thank you.

[2766.08 → 2768.08] Thank you.
[2768.08 → 2770.08] Thank you.
[2770.08 → 2772.08] Thank you.
[2772.08 → 2774.08] Thank you.
[2774.08 → 2776.08] Thank you.
[2776.08 → 2778.08] Thank you.
[2778.08 → 2786.70] to hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right
[2786.70 → 2793.86] hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[2794.60 → 2801.94] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
[2801.94 → 2810.80] of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen. Please join me in prayer.
[2812.28 → 2820.76] Lord, we thank you again for your goodness and your love, particularly in, again, the life of your child,
[2820.90 → 2827.68] your servant, Grace Krista. We praise you, O Lord, because you have died and yet you have risen from
[2827.68 → 2834.42] the grave. We thank you for the hope that we have that because Jesus conquered death, our own death
[2834.42 → 2841.82] is not the last word, but has become only the doorway through which we enter to dwell in the house of the
[2841.82 → 2848.88] Lord forever. Jesus, you call yourself the great shepherd of the sheep, and so we commit to you,
[2848.88 → 2857.04] Lord, our sister Grace. We commit her to your gracious care until you raise her up on that last day.
[2857.68 → 2865.30] And Lord, we ask that you would give us your comfort in the coming days, even as we put our hope in you.
[2865.82 → 2870.36] And we pray all these things in the strong name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
[2872.86 → 2879.90] So receive now the Lord's blessing, the benediction. I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of
[2879.90 → 2888.14] receiving his blessing. And this comes from the end of Psalm 121. The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[2888.84 → 2895.38] He will watch over your life. The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
[2896.34 → 2897.26] You may be seated.
[2897.26 → 2909.72] Thank you again so much for joining us today. And on behalf of the family, I want to invite you to join us for
[2909.72 → 2916.10] some refreshments in the fellowship hall right there after the service. And there are some drinks, some food,
[2916.22 → 2923.22] and we can spend time with one another sharing stories about grace. And, so please remain seated,
[2923.22 → 2932.22] and the ushers will, they will come and start at the beginning and usher you out row by row. Okay, so go in peace. Thank you.
[2936.22 → 2940.58] Okay, I'll help.
[2940.58 → 2942.58] Thank you.
[2970.58 → 2972.58] Thank you.
[3000.58 → 3001.58] Thank you.
[3001.58 → 3002.08] Thank you.
[3002.16 → 3002.58] Thank you.
[3030.58 → 3032.58] Amen.
