[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Amen.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Amen.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Amen.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Amen.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Amen.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Amen.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Amen.
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Amen.
[270.00 --> 272.00]  Amen.
[300.00 --> 302.00]  Amen.
[302.00 --> 304.00]  Amen.

[312.00 --> 314.00]  Amen.
[314.00 --> 316.00]  Amen.
[316.00 --> 318.00]  Amen.
[318.00 --> 324.00]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[324.00 --> 330.00]  Where does my help come from?
[330.00 --> 344.00]  My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[344.00 --> 348.00]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[348.00 --> 351.00]  You are my only hope.
[351.00 --> 357.00]  You're my only prayer.
[357.00 --> 364.00]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[364.00 --> 369.00]  Come and give me life.
[369.00 --> 376.00]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[376.00 --> 382.00]  Where does my help come from?
[382.00 --> 395.00]  My help comes from you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth.
[395.00 --> 398.00]  Oh, how I need you, Lord.
[398.00 --> 401.00]  You are my only hope.
[401.00 --> 407.00]  You're my only prayer.
[407.00 --> 414.00]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me.
[414.00 --> 419.00]  Come and give me life.
[419.00 --> 425.00]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[425.00 --> 431.00]  Where does my help come from?
[431.00 --> 451.00]  Come and give me life.
[451.00 --> 452.00]  Good morning.
[452.00 --> 453.00]  Good morning.
[453.00 --> 455.00]  And welcome, everyone, to our service today.
[455.00 --> 457.00]  It is good to be here.
[457.00 --> 461.00]  Take some time this morning to acknowledge Jesus as our Lord and Savior
[461.00 --> 464.00]  and spend time in praise, worship, and fellowship.
[464.00 --> 467.00]  And I certainly do hope and trust that today's service will be meaningful
[467.00 --> 471.00]  and enriching for all of us here this morning.
[471.00 --> 481.00]  I was reminded yesterday, thank you, Marion, that today is Reformation Sunday,
[481.00 --> 488.00]  the Sunday before 31st of October, where we remember Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses
[488.00 --> 496.00]  or points to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany, some 500 and change years ago now.
[496.00 --> 504.00]  So even though it meant I had to, yeah, scramble and start completely over on everything I had done so far,
[504.00 --> 508.00]  it did give me pause to think about what's changed since then.
[508.00 --> 513.00]  For instance, I didn't read the 95 theses on our church door.
[513.00 --> 519.00]  I somewhat shamefacedly looked up the Google AI overview on my computer.
[519.00 --> 528.00]  But even Google, I'm happy to say, affirmed the focus of the Reformed tradition of salvation through faith alone
[528.00 --> 531.00]  and the need for true repentance of sins.
[531.00 --> 534.00]  And that's worth keeping top of mind in our service today.
[534.00 --> 537.00]  So my name is Jake Cron and I'll be leading us through the first portion of the service
[537.00 --> 543.00]  before Pastor Jason leads us in a hopefully more biblical-based study of Romans 8.
[543.00 --> 547.00]  I don't have a lot of other announcements actually, other than what's in your bulletin.
[547.00 --> 549.00]  So lots going on.
[549.00 --> 552.00]  There's cross training started up again.
[552.00 --> 556.00]  There's the Operation Christmas Child and a soup and bun lunch in a few weeks.
[556.00 --> 560.00]  So start thinking about that and preparing your appetites.
[560.00 --> 566.00]  Our call to worship this morning is from Hebrews, chapter 12, first two verses.
[566.00 --> 573.00]  Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight
[573.00 --> 580.00]  and the sin that clings so closely and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
[580.00 --> 584.00]  looking to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[584.00 --> 586.00]  Please join me in prayer.
[586.00 --> 597.00]  Gather us together this Reformation Sunday, O God, that we may celebrate the witness of our forefathers
[597.00 --> 602.00]  and foremothers and the courage that gave birth to the Reformation.
[602.00 --> 608.00]  Teach us how to honor the saints of God in ages past as well as in our present days.
[608.00 --> 614.58]  May the conviction of your grace, written on our hearts, be one that forms our own faith.
[616.64 --> 623.42]  Inspire us in the continuing reformation of the church and be present to us in your word and sacrament.
[624.50 --> 626.68]  In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[628.08 --> 631.24]  Now is a good time to stand, if you are able, and greet those around you.
[638.00 --> 640.00]  Amen.
[668.00 --> 669.00]  Amen.
[682.64 --> 688.56]  Well, my apologies, Jake. I had no intention of upsetting your day yesterday.
[688.56 --> 698.92]  But when I was choosing songs for today, I, of course, looked at the song we always sing on Reformation, A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.
[699.76 --> 703.42]  And as I tend to do, I question things.
[703.68 --> 709.72]  And I said, 500 plus years later, do we still need to sing this song?
[709.96 --> 710.86]  It's archaic.
[710.86 --> 718.58]  You listen, you look at the words, and how many of us would have to go home and look at what bulwark means?
[719.48 --> 720.92]  A bulwark never failing.
[721.10 --> 722.80]  If you need to look it up at home, do that.
[723.34 --> 725.40]  And just the phrasing, it's old.
[725.76 --> 730.14]  It's hard sometimes to understand.
[730.14 --> 741.76]  But if we really apply ourselves to it, we will see that it is a beautiful text that was applicable to the time when the Protestants protested.
[742.06 --> 753.44]  But it also is a song that is applicable to us today in terms of the world and what's going on and also our own spiritual lives.
[753.54 --> 758.76]  It always applies to us, too, as Christians and as the church.
[758.76 --> 769.12]  So I hope you can really pay attention to the words this morning on this hymn and let it seep into you.
[769.40 --> 771.00]  A mighty fortress is our God.
[771.00 --> 773.16]  A mighty fortress is our God.
[773.16 --> 789.52]  A mighty fortress is our God.
[789.52 --> 794.50]  A bow work never failing.
[794.50 --> 806.12]  Our helper, he and his blood of mortal ills prevailing.
[806.12 --> 817.32]  For still our ancient foe does seek to work us whole.
[817.32 --> 822.52]  His craft and power are great.
[822.52 --> 827.72]  And armed with cruel hate.
[827.72 --> 833.08]  On earth is not his equal.
[835.08 --> 840.68]  Did we in our own strength confide?
[840.68 --> 845.72]  Our striving would be losing.
[845.72 --> 852.36]  Were not the right man on our side.
[852.36 --> 857.88]  The man of God's own choosing.
[857.88 --> 863.40]  You ask who that may be.
[863.40 --> 868.52]  Christ Jesus it is he.
[868.52 --> 873.72]  Lord, stop our hope is safe.
[873.72 --> 879.00]  From age to age the same.
[879.00 --> 884.68]  And he must win the battle.
[884.68 --> 892.56]  And though this world with devils filled
[892.56 --> 905.04]  We will not fear for God has willed.
[905.04 --> 911.28]  His truth to triumph through us.
[911.28 --> 916.64]  The prince of darkness grinned.
[916.64 --> 921.84]  We tremble not for him.
[921.84 --> 927.12]  His rage we can endure.
[927.12 --> 932.08]  For lo, his doom is sure.
[932.08 --> 939.76]  One little word shall fell near.
[939.76 --> 946.16]  That word above all earthly powers.
[946.40 --> 951.44]  No thanks to them abided.
[951.44 --> 958.18]  The spirit and the gifts are ours.
[958.18 --> 964.66]  Through him who will have us hidden.
[964.66 --> 969.86]  Let good and kindred go.
[969.86 --> 975.06]  This mortal life also.
[975.06 --> 980.34]  The body they may kill.
[980.34 --> 985.78]  God's truth the lightest tell.
[985.78 --> 994.58]  His kingdom is forever.
[994.58 --> 995.38]  God's drift.
[995.38 --> 995.94]  Thomas Quietson
[995.94 --> 996.34]  Rossi
[996.34 --> 997.14]  That war's good.
[997.14 --> 997.42]  God's truth.
[997.42 --> 998.06]  Oh, I am.
[998.06 --> 998.50]  It's not only, I am.
[998.50 --> 999.18]  On earth.
[999.18 --> 1000.32]  Here it is, not only.
[1000.32 --> 1001.66]  For me, it's not only.
[1001.66 --> 1003.66]  It's not only.
[1003.66 --> 1005.74]  Time is true.
[1005.74 --> 1008.38]  How undUA Floor yet is the world for you.
[1008.38 --> 1017.04]  The life of men, for us, for us, for us, for us not for us to be noble.
[1017.04 --> 1021.06]  It for us, for us, for us, for us, for us, for us, for.
[1021.06 --> 1024.06]  For us, for us, for us, for us, for us, for us to become
[1024.06 --> 1031.96]  Perhaps creation longs to have the words to say
[1031.96 --> 1038.36]  But this joy is mine
[1038.36 --> 1047.20]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1047.20 --> 1054.28]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor, and the praise
[1054.28 --> 1060.20]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1060.76 --> 1068.20]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1068.20 --> 1074.50]  Who else would die for our redemption?
[1074.50 --> 1082.56]  Whose resurrection needs our rise
[1082.56 --> 1090.56]  There isn't time enough to sing of all you've done
[1090.56 --> 1095.50]  But I have eternity to try
[1095.50 --> 1104.84]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1104.84 --> 1111.80]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor, and the praise
[1111.80 --> 1117.94]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1117.94 --> 1124.44]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1124.44 --> 1131.80]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1131.80 --> 1139.86]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor, and the praise
[1139.86 --> 1144.86]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1144.86 --> 1152.92]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1152.92 --> 1167.98]  Praise to the Lord
[1167.98 --> 1168.98]  To the Lord
[1168.98 --> 1172.12]  To the Lamb
[1172.12 --> 1176.04]  To the King of Heaven
[1176.04 --> 1177.04]  Praise
[1177.04 --> 1181.04]  For He rose
[1181.04 --> 1184.04]  Now He raised
[1184.04 --> 1188.04]  We will sing forever
[1188.04 --> 1190.04]  Praise
[1190.04 --> 1191.10]  Praise
[1191.10 --> 1195.10]  To the Lord
[1195.10 --> 1196.10]  To the Lamb
[1196.10 --> 1198.10]  To the Lamb
[1198.10 --> 1202.10]  To the King of Heaven
[1202.10 --> 1204.10]  Praise
[1204.10 --> 1207.10]  For He rose
[1207.10 --> 1210.10]  Now He raised
[1210.10 --> 1215.16]  We will sing forever
[1215.16 --> 1217.16]  We will sing forever
[1217.16 --> 1226.16]  With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name
[1226.16 --> 1232.16]  You alone deserve the glory, the honor, and the praise
[1232.16 --> 1238.22]  Lord Jesus, this song is forever yours
[1238.22 --> 1245.22]  A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[1245.22 --> 1271.68]  Our first scripture reading today is from Job chapter 19
[1271.68 --> 1274.82]  First 29 verses
[1274.82 --> 1275.78]  So the whole chapter
[1275.78 --> 1279.56]  And you can find out on page 385 of your pew bibles
[1279.56 --> 1280.50]  If you'd like to follow along
[1280.50 --> 1282.82]  And I think it'll be on the screen too
[1282.82 --> 1291.30]  Then Job replied
[1291.30 --> 1295.06]  How long will you torment me and crush me with words
[1295.06 --> 1297.80]  Ten times now you have reproached me
[1297.80 --> 1299.60]  Shamelessly you attack me
[1299.60 --> 1302.16]  If it is true that I have gone astray
[1302.16 --> 1304.60]  My error remains my concern alone
[1304.60 --> 1307.86]  If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me
[1307.86 --> 1309.96]  And use my humiliation against me
[1309.96 --> 1312.24]  Then know that God has wronged me
[1312.24 --> 1313.86]  And drawn His net around me
[1313.86 --> 1316.20]  Though I cry violence
[1316.20 --> 1317.72]  I get no response
[1317.72 --> 1319.32]  Though I call for help
[1319.32 --> 1320.74]  There is no justice
[1320.74 --> 1324.04]  He has blocked my way so I cannot pass
[1324.04 --> 1326.74]  He has shrouded my paths in darkness
[1326.74 --> 1328.96]  He has stripped me of my honor
[1328.96 --> 1330.88]  And removed the crown from my head
[1330.88 --> 1333.56]  He tears me down on every side
[1333.56 --> 1334.52]  Till I am gone
[1334.52 --> 1337.36]  He uproots my hope like a tree
[1337.36 --> 1339.34]  His anger burns against me
[1339.34 --> 1341.72]  He counts me among his enemies
[1341.72 --> 1344.24]  His troops advance in force
[1344.24 --> 1346.48]  They build a siege ramp against me
[1346.48 --> 1348.60]  And encamp me around my tent
[1348.60 --> 1351.46]  He has alienated my family from me
[1351.46 --> 1354.62]  My acquaintances are completely estranged from me
[1354.62 --> 1356.90]  My relatives have gone away
[1356.90 --> 1359.22]  My closest friends have forgotten me
[1359.22 --> 1363.24]  My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner
[1363.24 --> 1365.46]  They look on me as a stranger
[1365.46 --> 1367.48]  I summon my servant
[1367.48 --> 1369.24]  But he does not answer
[1369.24 --> 1371.64]  Though I beg him with my own mouth
[1371.64 --> 1374.00]  My breath is offensive to my wife
[1374.00 --> 1376.14]  I am loathsome to my own family
[1376.14 --> 1378.24]  Even the little boys scorn me
[1378.24 --> 1380.52]  When I appear they ridicule me
[1380.52 --> 1383.38]  All my intimate friends detest me
[1383.38 --> 1385.74]  Those I love have turned against me
[1385.74 --> 1388.18]  I am nothing but skin and bones
[1388.18 --> 1390.86]  I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth
[1390.86 --> 1392.78]  Have pity on me
[1392.78 --> 1394.46]  My friends have pity
[1394.46 --> 1396.78]  For the hand of God has struck me
[1396.78 --> 1400.64]  Why do you pursue me as God does?
[1400.98 --> 1402.92]  Will you never get enough of my flesh?
[1403.88 --> 1405.38]  Oh that my words were recorded
[1405.38 --> 1406.96]  That they were written on a scroll
[1406.96 --> 1410.82]  That they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead
[1410.82 --> 1412.48]  Or engraved in rock forever
[1412.48 --> 1415.42]  I know that my Redeemer lives
[1415.42 --> 1416.64]  And that in the end
[1416.64 --> 1418.18]  He will stand on the earth
[1418.18 --> 1420.72]  And after my skin has been destroyed
[1420.72 --> 1423.38]  Yet in my flesh I will see God
[1423.38 --> 1427.38]  I myself will see him with my own eyes
[1427.38 --> 1429.42]  I and not another
[1429.42 --> 1432.06]  How my heart yearns within me
[1432.06 --> 1433.32]  If you say
[1433.32 --> 1435.88]  How we will hound him
[1435.88 --> 1437.86]  Since the root of the trouble lies in him
[1437.86 --> 1439.90]  You should fear the sword yourselves
[1439.90 --> 1442.92]  For wrath will bring punishment by the sword
[1442.92 --> 1445.86]  And then you will know that there is judgment
[1445.86 --> 1451.82]  Please join me in prayer of confession
[1451.82 --> 1458.90]  Let us put aside our good works
[1458.90 --> 1460.58]  And remember that we do sin
[1460.58 --> 1462.68]  And fall short of the glory of God
[1462.68 --> 1468.76]  Lord, of all the demands of your righteousness
[1468.76 --> 1471.62]  Are too hard for us to fulfill alone
[1471.62 --> 1473.96]  So we rush off with this excuse
[1473.96 --> 1475.42]  And ignore your law
[1475.42 --> 1478.24]  You forgive our iniquity
[1478.24 --> 1479.80]  And remember our sin no more
[1479.80 --> 1481.44]  And we abuse this freedom
[1481.44 --> 1482.92]  As if it were a license
[1482.92 --> 1484.12]  To selfishness
[1484.12 --> 1485.26]  Self-indulgence
[1485.26 --> 1486.72]  And self-righteousness
[1486.72 --> 1489.36]  You give us the gift of grace
[1489.36 --> 1491.88]  Atonement in the blood of your Son
[1491.88 --> 1493.30]  Yet we make it cheap
[1493.30 --> 1494.96]  Without serious repentance
[1494.96 --> 1498.18]  We fail to see the power of your faithfulness
[1498.18 --> 1500.06]  We are your people
[1500.06 --> 1502.56]  But do we know you as our God
[1502.56 --> 1505.52]  Forgive us, Lord, the sins we know in our heart
[1505.52 --> 1508.56]  Save us, Lord, from the sins we hide
[1508.56 --> 1513.36]  God of our refuge and strength
[1513.36 --> 1514.80]  Have mercy on us
[1514.80 --> 1516.36]  Right on our hearts
[1516.36 --> 1517.20]  Amen
[1517.20 --> 1521.84]  God does show us
[1521.84 --> 1523.32]  God's own righteousness
[1523.32 --> 1524.86]  And divine forbearance
[1524.86 --> 1526.68]  Through the work of the Holy Spirit
[1526.68 --> 1527.42]  Given to us
[1527.42 --> 1529.08]  We may come to know the truth
[1529.08 --> 1529.98]  And be made free
[1529.98 --> 1532.04]  Jesus Christ
[1532.04 --> 1533.14]  The Son of God
[1533.14 --> 1535.08]  Sets us free from our slavery to sin
[1535.08 --> 1537.10]  Our sins are forgiven
[1537.10 --> 1539.48]  Through his death and resurrection
[1539.48 --> 1541.06]  A place is made for us
[1541.06 --> 1542.02]  In the household
[1542.02 --> 1543.58]  And we may be known
[1543.58 --> 1545.06]  As children of God
[1545.06 --> 1546.20]  To the glory
[1546.20 --> 1547.86]  Of the Father
[1547.86 --> 1548.56]  And the Son
[1548.56 --> 1549.44]  And the Holy Spirit
[1549.44 --> 1550.04]  Amen
[1550.04 --> 1552.72]  Our song of response
[1552.72 --> 1553.16]  Is titled
[1553.16 --> 1554.16]  The Lord's Prayer
[1554.16 --> 1555.26]  After which the children
[1555.26 --> 1556.68]  Ages 3 to grade 3
[1556.68 --> 1557.82]  Are dismissed to their classes
[1557.82 --> 1577.88]  Father let your kingdom come
[1577.88 --> 1581.80]  Father let your will be done
[1581.80 --> 1585.06]  On earth as in heaven
[1585.06 --> 1589.24]  Right here in my heart
[1589.24 --> 1593.08]  Father let your kingdom come

[1599.10 --> 1603.30]  Right here in my heart

[1608.36 --> 1609.36]  Forgive us
[1609.36 --> 1610.36]  Forgive us
[1610.36 --> 1615.78]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
[1615.78 --> 1617.36]  Forgive them
[1617.36 --> 1621.42]  And lead us not into temptation
[1621.42 --> 1627.68]  But deliver us from the evil one
[1627.68 --> 1629.68]  Let your kingdom come
[1629.68 --> 1630.68]  Let your kingdom come
[1630.68 --> 1633.68]  Father let your kingdom come
[1633.68 --> 1637.68]  Father let your will be done
[1637.68 --> 1640.68]  On earth as in heaven
[1640.68 --> 1644.94]  Right here in my heart
[1644.94 --> 1647.68]  Father let your kingdom come

[1651.68 --> 1654.68]  On earth as in heaven
[1654.68 --> 1654.70]  On earth as in heaven

[1663.68 --> 1664.68]  Forgive us
[1664.68 --> 1665.68]  Forgive us
[1665.68 --> 1670.68]  As we forgive the ones who sinned against us
[1670.68 --> 1671.68]  Forgive them
[1671.68 --> 1676.68]  And lead us not into temptation
[1676.68 --> 1682.68]  But deliver us from the evil one
[1682.68 --> 1686.68]  Let your kingdom come

[1752.24 --> 1757.68]  father let your kingdom come father let your will be done
[1762.80 --> 1763.84]  here in my heart
[1763.84 --> 1777.84]  on earth as in heaven right here in my heart
[1777.84 --> 1805.84]  good morning to you all
[1805.84 --> 1814.24]  so today we are returning to the book of romans where we have been spending some time this fall
[1814.24 --> 1822.24]  in romans chapter 8 which is romans has 16 chapters so it's the center but it's also in a sense the
[1822.24 --> 1832.32]  highest it's this mountaintop of god's grace to us and and so we've been exploring that together and
[1832.32 --> 1839.20]  today we will be reading verses 18 to 25 so turn with me in your bibles if you would
[1846.56 --> 1850.96]  it's on page 841 in your pew bible if you'd like to follow along there 841
[1850.96 --> 1864.00]  and um so we're in romans chapter 8 beginning in verse 18 for i consider that our present sufferings
[1864.00 --> 1871.28]  are not worth comparing with the glory that we will be revealed in us the creation waits in eager
[1871.28 --> 1878.32]  expectation for the sons of god to be revealed for the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own
[1878.32 --> 1885.12]  choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be liberated
[1885.12 --> 1889.76]  from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of god
[1890.96 --> 1895.28]  we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth
[1895.28 --> 1901.68]  right up to the present time not only so but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit
[1901.68 --> 1909.60]  grown inwardly as we await eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies for in this hope
[1909.60 --> 1917.04]  we were saved the hope that is seen is no hope at all who hopes for what he already has but if we
[1917.04 --> 1924.24]  hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently this is the word of the lord
[1924.24 --> 1931.60]  we speak to god um if any of you are confused because the bulletin says only verses 17 and 18
[1932.40 --> 1939.04]  you're not well i just changed it so i can do that you know i can do that so but let's pray together
[1942.72 --> 1950.48]  heavenly father we thank you lord that you are a god who does not remain silent but lord you are a god
[1950.48 --> 1957.04]  who speaks you are a god who reveals yourselves yourself so lord would you speak to each of us
[1957.04 --> 1964.56]  this morning through your word lord help us to listen to your voice knowing that christ is present
[1964.56 --> 1971.76]  with us that christ is speaking even today through the holy spirit lord we ask for the truth of the gospel
[1972.64 --> 1979.36]  to be made clear to us as we accept it by faith we pray in jesus name amen
[1980.48 --> 1987.36]  so sometimes we come across things in the bible that we know we will never fully understand
[1988.24 --> 1995.36]  not at least until we get to heaven there are many such things but one of them is glory
[1997.84 --> 2006.72]  yet the greatest thing that god has in store for us as his people is glory and so if you look at our
[2006.72 --> 2014.64]  passage in verse 18 that we read paul says i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing
[2014.64 --> 2024.48]  with what the glory that will be revealed in us glory that's what is in store for god's people so what is
[2024.48 --> 2032.64]  glory what is glory you know one commentary i read this week said it like this glory is truly beyond
[2032.64 --> 2038.72]  our comprehension at our comprehension at best we only have a hint of it
[2040.40 --> 2048.40]  um so on friday night we may have saw a hint of glory as the blue jays you know slammed a you know grand slam
[2049.60 --> 2054.96]  it's a picture of glory um another one that came to mind for me this week as i was
[2054.96 --> 2065.76]  uh preparing was my brother's wedding that uh was several years ago now but it was an outdoor ceremony
[2065.76 --> 2072.00]  which isn't so unusual but what surprised me was that it was actually in the woods
[2073.68 --> 2080.16]  and so to get to where the ceremony was going to take place everyone we had to walk across this lawn
[2080.16 --> 2088.08]  and then follow a forest path that led you know through green laurels under the canopy of tree
[2088.08 --> 2095.28]  branches and then to a clearing that was right beside a clear brook it was a beautiful setting for
[2095.28 --> 2101.68]  a wedding but the glory part is this my brother and his bride were both graduate students in violin
[2101.68 --> 2110.56]  performance and there was a moment in the ceremony when they played a duet together their violins you
[2110.56 --> 2116.96]  know intermingling the sound it was beautiful and as they played the sun broke through the trees
[2117.84 --> 2122.96]  and we were surrounded by the beauty of god's creation family and friends gathered together
[2122.96 --> 2126.64]  the joy of the celebration it was a hint of glory
[2126.64 --> 2137.36]  you know the bible tells us that we were made to dwell in glory but that it was lost to us and that
[2137.36 --> 2148.08]  we long for glory to be restored we long to see and experience glory but even more than that we long to participate in it
[2148.96 --> 2153.60]  right we want to be on the inside of this heavenly glory
[2153.60 --> 2162.08]  here's how c.s lewis put it in his essay that's called the weight of glory it's a little bit of a
[2162.08 --> 2168.32]  longer quote but it's on the screen if you'd like to listen as i read it for us this is what c.s lewis says
[2169.52 --> 2178.32]  we do not want merely to see beauty though god knows even that is bounty enough we want something else
[2178.32 --> 2192.08]  to be united with the beauty we see to pass into it to receive it into ourselves to bathe in it to become
[2192.08 --> 2202.08]  part of it at present we are on the outside of the world the wrong side of the door we discern the
[2202.08 --> 2208.80]  freshness and purity of the morning but they do not make us fresh and pure we cannot mingle with the
[2208.80 --> 2217.20]  splendors we see but all the leaves of the new testament are rustling with the rumor that it will not always
[2217.20 --> 2224.96]  be so someday god willing we shall get in we will put on glory
[2224.96 --> 2237.92]  glory it's a beautiful passage that we will one day not only see glimpses of glory but we will put on
[2238.56 --> 2248.64]  glory ourselves and that is i think what our passage is about this morning paul says if you are united
[2248.64 --> 2255.52]  to jesus christ you will one day get in not being on the other side of the door but you will get in
[2255.52 --> 2263.04]  to glory one day we will share in the glory of our lord jesus christ but right now even though we
[2263.04 --> 2269.44]  sometimes see glimpses of glory our experience in this world on kind of the wrong side of the door
[2270.16 --> 2276.88]  is what paul calls our present suffering you know we know that things are not the way they should be
[2277.60 --> 2283.92]  but we also have the assurance that jesus will come again and he will put all things to right including
[2283.92 --> 2293.20]  us and that is a whole outlook that we are given here in romans chapter 8 it tells us how to consider
[2293.20 --> 2300.64]  our present sufferings in this world and to do so to consider our present sufferings in light of
[2301.36 --> 2307.04]  the future glory that we will one day enter into so this morning i want to look at that movement from
[2308.40 --> 2314.96]  present suffering to future glory or from groaning to glory and so this week that will be our focus our
[2314.96 --> 2322.16]  focus will be on the glory that is in store for us as human beings and next week we're going to look
[2322.16 --> 2327.36]  at the same passage and we're going to talk about god's plan for the whole of creation because this is a
[2327.36 --> 2334.24]  key passage in the new testament on creation and i don't have time to do both in the same sermon so
[2334.24 --> 2339.84]  today we're going to focus on our us as human beings next week on all of creation but for today
[2340.40 --> 2347.84]  we begin in our first point with the reality of present suffering okay so we'll let's take a look
[2347.84 --> 2356.88]  at verse 22 as we begin verse 22 says we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the
[2356.88 --> 2364.40]  pains of childbirth right up to the present time and so here paul saying that the whole creation is
[2364.40 --> 2373.04]  suffering right um animals and trees water earth and sky is groaning because it has been subjected to
[2373.04 --> 2378.64]  what paul calls frustration and decay and again we're going to come back to that next week but
[2378.64 --> 2386.24]  then paul continues in verse 23 not only so not only creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits
[2386.24 --> 2395.44]  of the spirit grown inwardly as we await eagerly for our adoption to sonship the redemption of our bodies
[2395.44 --> 2406.16]  now to understand what paul is saying here we need to know the story of the bible so if we go all the
[2406.16 --> 2411.28]  way back to the beginning all the way back to those first early chapters of genesis you will remember
[2411.92 --> 2421.28]  that god put the first man and the first woman adam and eve into the garden of eden and in creation we
[2421.28 --> 2430.40]  learn that each one of us was made to live with god that's what we were made for god breathed his life
[2430.40 --> 2442.08]  into us and god created us in his image we were made with glory we were made for glory but is that our
[2442.08 --> 2449.60]  experience today it is not okay we know that things did not stay that way and what happened was we rejected
[2449.60 --> 2456.64]  god we rejected god's ways and we replaced it with our own and as a result sin and brokenness came into
[2456.64 --> 2463.52]  the world and so what sin did was it first broke our relationship that we had with god in creation
[2464.80 --> 2470.88]  remember that there was that sad moment in genesis chapter 3 when adam and eve first were hiding from
[2470.88 --> 2479.12]  god and then they were actually expelled by god from the garden okay but not only are we now estranged from
[2479.84 --> 2486.72]  god who created us but we also know that we are sinners and we see the effects of sin in our own lives
[2486.72 --> 2495.60]  right god the image in us has been corrupted even our bodies fall apart and all of us have these elements
[2495.60 --> 2502.88]  of brokenness and sin and shame in our lives we are now well described by the biblical name
[2502.88 --> 2511.92]  ichabod do you have you heard that name before in the bible ichabod was it mean no glory and that's
[2512.48 --> 2518.80]  that's kind of the name that we could all in a sense have this is the world we live in now our present
[2518.80 --> 2528.00]  reality is one marked not by glory but by groaning and now so one of the things to keep in mind is that the
[2528.00 --> 2534.40]  bible is actually typically much more realistic than we are about the reality of suffering in the world
[2535.60 --> 2542.16]  like we you know when we suffer we're always surprised we're shocked this is not right and it's
[2542.16 --> 2549.04]  true we we are surprised by suffering as if it is a strange thing but the bible is never surprised by
[2549.04 --> 2554.80]  suffering because the bible understands that we live in a deeply flawed and fallen world
[2554.80 --> 2564.40]  so when paul refers to our present sufferings in verse 18 what he's doing is a is acknowledging that
[2564.40 --> 2573.20]  until christ returns we all experience suffering in this life and so how then are we to respond to
[2573.20 --> 2580.80]  suffering well think about in paul's day in the first centuries of the roman empire probably the most
[2580.80 --> 2588.00]  common response to suffering was based on a philosophy called stoicism you know if you ever say oh that
[2588.00 --> 2595.76]  person is very stoic it comes from this philosophy so what do the stoics believe well they believe that
[2595.76 --> 2602.64]  when suffering comes along what do you do how do you respond you basically suck it up because that's life
[2603.20 --> 2609.28]  okay and if you just basically accept that suffering is a part of life then when bad things come when
[2609.28 --> 2617.20]  suffering comes you won't let it get to you right so you try to have emotional control you don't cry
[2618.32 --> 2624.40]  you don't groan you know i think what is it a stiff upper lip that kind of thing right stoic
[2625.84 --> 2631.36]  but that friends is not the christian response to suffering the bible never says have a stiff upper lip
[2631.36 --> 2641.04]  christianity says the human thing to do when you suffer is to groan it's this word meaning a deep cry
[2641.60 --> 2648.32]  because of loss right you you cry you lament that's the christian response
[2648.32 --> 2662.08]  so one of my daughter gabby's favorite books is heidi yes yes okay and uh when and so the story the
[2662.08 --> 2666.80]  part of the story is heidi is a little girl how how many of you like the like heidi right and want to
[2666.80 --> 2674.40]  live in switzerland yeah we do uh and so the part i want to share with you is when heidi meets her old
[2674.40 --> 2682.96]  grandmother for the first time and discovers what her grandmother is blind so heidi says to her
[2682.96 --> 2690.16]  grandmother that she says this grandmother but if you come out in the morning into the shining white
[2690.16 --> 2698.08]  snow i'm sure you will see come and see heidi took the old woman's hand and tried to pull her up
[2698.08 --> 2707.28]  but she was very upset at the thought of her never seeing anything let me be child i can't see any
[2707.28 --> 2715.92]  better even in the light of the snow i am always in the dark even in the summer granny heidi persisted
[2715.92 --> 2721.76]  anxiously surely you can see the sunshine and watch it say goodnight to the mountains and make them all
[2721.76 --> 2732.56]  red like fire can't you no child not that either i shall never see them again and then it says heidi burst
[2732.56 --> 2740.88]  into tears you know we can come up with all kinds of examples i could have read from from literature from
[2740.88 --> 2748.64]  our own life experiences about suffering but you know suffering is real not being able to see the beauty
[2748.64 --> 2754.72]  of creation is a type of suffering that is real and it's wrong and it's something that we ought to cry
[2754.72 --> 2761.68]  about and the bible actually permits followers of jesus to groan at the reality of present suffering
[2762.48 --> 2768.32]  and not only does the bible permit it but in a sense it says it is necessary because things are not the
[2768.32 --> 2775.44]  way they're meant to be but but the good news is that in and through jesus christ we actually also have
[2775.44 --> 2781.36]  the hope of glory okay so that's our second point this morning and and that's also something we see
[2781.36 --> 2787.76]  in this passage not just the reality of present suffering but the hope of future glory so let's go
[2787.76 --> 2795.20]  up again and look at verse 18 and see what paul says he says i consider that our present sufferings
[2796.00 --> 2805.36]  are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us notice what he says i consider
[2805.44 --> 2815.92]  it's an accounting sort of way of thinking about things it's like he's saying you know what i've
[2815.92 --> 2823.12]  considered this reality of suffering i've i've thought it through i've weighed the evidence i've done the math
[2824.40 --> 2831.68]  and he's making a comparison between the suffering that we now experience in this life and the glory that
[2831.68 --> 2838.48]  we shall have in the future and what paul is inviting us to do is kind of to imagine a scale
[2839.28 --> 2844.64]  right you want to think of a scale with two sides of the scale and a scale is used to measure the weight
[2844.64 --> 2851.04]  or the value of something right and so he's saying if you put all of our sufferings on one side of the
[2851.04 --> 2857.28]  scale and the glory that will be ours on the other side of the scale what happens is that suffering is so
[2857.28 --> 2865.44]  light and momentary and insignificant that it would just go flying up into the air as the way of glory
[2865.44 --> 2875.04]  comes crashing down he says our present sufferings are not even worth comparing to the weight of glory
[2875.04 --> 2883.04]  that will be revealed in us it's like 10 solid gold bars a huge sack of gold compared to like a little
[2883.04 --> 2890.96]  grain of rice and when we view the christian life in this way we see that following jesus is worth
[2890.96 --> 2898.80]  everything right following jesus is worth giving everything up for right jesus tells the parable
[2898.80 --> 2905.76]  of a man who finds what a treasure in a field and he goes and he sells everything he has
[2905.76 --> 2912.64]  to gain that treasure following jesus is worth everything for the glory that will be revealed in
[2912.64 --> 2920.96]  us and so when we consider our present sufferings as real as they are in light of the future glory
[2920.96 --> 2930.00]  that is ours as real as that will be really there is no comparison so now if we look again at verse 23
[2930.00 --> 2936.80]  it says not only so we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit grown inwardly
[2937.60 --> 2943.20]  as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship the redemption of our bodies
[2944.24 --> 2950.08]  and so what does that tell us it tells us that the bible doesn't end the story of the bible does not
[2950.08 --> 2957.12]  end in sin and suffering the story doesn't stop there it doesn't end with adam and eve just outside
[2957.12 --> 2962.48]  the garden banished from the presence of god because the bible teaches us that god loves us
[2963.20 --> 2969.12]  and he sent jesus into the world to save us to repair and to renew everything broken by sin
[2970.32 --> 2977.76]  jesus came to forgive our sins he came to take away our condemnation and he came to bring us back
[2977.76 --> 2984.48]  into god's presence paul says here we have been adopted as children of god
[2984.48 --> 2992.64]  and that salvation also means not only that we are restored in relationship to god we've been adopted
[2992.64 --> 2999.76]  into his family that relationship has been healed but also we are restored in ourselves right the
[2999.76 --> 3006.56]  redemption of our bodies jesus came not only to forgive our sins and to adopt us into his family
[3006.56 --> 3016.88]  but he came to make us fully human again right to restore god's image in us to restore us to glory
[3018.08 --> 3025.52]  and that is the glory that we will that will one day be revealed into into us so now paul continues in
[3025.52 --> 3036.08]  verses 24 and 25 where it says for in this hope we were saved but hope that is seen is no hope at all
[3036.64 --> 3042.96]  who hopes for what they already have but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently
[3042.96 --> 3053.44]  so if you want to know when this glory will be revealed in us it's obviously not in this world
[3054.32 --> 3060.64]  but in the world to come and it's something that we still long for it's something that we wait for
[3060.64 --> 3068.72]  patiently we put our hope in and this promise of romans 8 right verse 18 that our present sufferings are
[3068.72 --> 3075.92]  not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us that has been the hope of god's
[3075.92 --> 3083.84]  people throughout the story of the bible so who is one of the first people that god said that to
[3084.40 --> 3090.08]  who would god said to them your present sufferings are not worthy to be compared to the hope that you
[3090.08 --> 3097.92]  will receive well god said that first to job right we read job chapter 19. job loses his family
[3098.64 --> 3104.88]  he loses his dignity he goes through pain and suffering of every kind he ends up with friends
[3104.88 --> 3113.04]  who make it worse and what does god say god says job i consider that for you the present sufferings of
[3113.04 --> 3119.52]  your life are not even worthy to be compared to the future glory that will be revealed in you
[3120.88 --> 3125.68]  that was job's hope he says i know that my redeemer lives and that in the end
[3125.68 --> 3130.24]  i he will stand on the earth and i will behold him with my eyes
[3132.64 --> 3141.36]  hope that will be seen god says to abraham abraham i want you to leave your home
[3141.36 --> 3148.16]  i want you to leave your family and go to a new place that i will show you but it's not even worth
[3148.16 --> 3155.92]  comparing with the glory that will be revealed in you god says to moses moses you've got 40 years to
[3155.92 --> 3162.80]  wander in the desert leading a stiff-necked rebellious people but it's not even worth comparing
[3162.80 --> 3168.96]  david your son is going to try and murder you and take your throne but don't worry
[3168.96 --> 3176.80]  it's not even worth comparing mary your son is going to die upon a cross in public shame
[3176.80 --> 3180.24]  but don't worry it's not even worth comparing
[3182.24 --> 3186.72]  and perhaps most shocking is when we read in scripture about our savior
[3186.72 --> 3194.64]  where god says to jesus jesus you are going to be rejected by men people will hide their faces from
[3194.64 --> 3202.32]  you the iniquity of us all will be laid upon you it will be my will to crush you people will say that
[3202.32 --> 3209.44]  you are out of your mind that you perform your miracles by the power of a demon you will be abandoned
[3210.40 --> 3220.48]  and deserted and crucified but jesus these sufferings are not even worth comparing to the glory that
[3221.28 --> 3222.40]  will be revealed in you
[3225.20 --> 3231.84]  and for for some of us sitting here right you have maybe inward suffering
[3233.60 --> 3236.96]  right that that really the only people in the world who know
[3236.96 --> 3243.92]  about your inward mental spiritual emotional anguish are you and god
[3246.64 --> 3252.72]  some of you have physical sufferings right bodily sufferings that you will live with with for the rest of
[3252.72 --> 3260.80]  your life right every single day you are reminded by your physical suffering some of you have relational
[3260.80 --> 3265.68]  suffering strained or broken relationships some of you have financial suffering
[3265.68 --> 3272.72]  or some of you are going to suffer reproach for being a christian from family or from friends
[3273.60 --> 3280.56]  and we could go on and on and on suffering after suffering after suffering and what does god say to us
[3281.60 --> 3287.52]  he says that the sufferings plural many and varied each unique to each person sitting here
[3287.52 --> 3292.48]  is not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed in you
[3297.28 --> 3304.96]  in the book of revelation at the end of god's story it gives us a picture of humanity of human beings being
[3304.96 --> 3308.08]  restored to glory so this is what it says
[3308.08 --> 3318.56]  i saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband
[3320.56 --> 3329.84]  he's talking about the church he's talking about you he's talking about the new humanity that is now perfected in beauty
[3329.84 --> 3331.92]  and is glorious
[3334.24 --> 3345.28]  right right now in this present life glory and shame are intermingled but in the future in christ it is all glory
[3346.56 --> 3351.76]  no suffering god says i will wipe away every tear from their eyes there will be no more death
[3351.76 --> 3361.36]  or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things the order of groaning and suffering has passed away
[3363.52 --> 3370.48]  you know and even as i say that even as we know this story that could kind of sound like a fairy tale couldn't it
[3371.92 --> 3377.60]  right and it would be a fairy tale it would be something that you should never believe
[3378.24 --> 3386.40]  except for the fact that it happened to jesus and so what is the basis of this hope that we don't see
[3386.40 --> 3393.92]  but we wait patiently for how can we be sure that this is where everything is headed and we are sure because
[3393.92 --> 3403.28]  jesus went first jesus has already entered that glory jesus himself suffered more than any of us have ever
[3403.28 --> 3413.04]  suffered jesus himself died and jesus himself was resurrected on that first easter morning and that the glory
[3413.04 --> 3420.64]  that he now knows before the face of god is such that he can look back and say it was all worth it
[3421.84 --> 3431.36]  bringing all of us into his kingdom was worth it because of the glory that he now has
[3431.36 --> 3436.64]  he's been lifted up to the highest place and given a name that is above every name
[3439.60 --> 3447.20]  and if you have been made co-heirs with christ through faith in him paul says you will share
[3447.20 --> 3453.84]  in his glory as well you will behold jesus christ face to face you will be with all of your brothers
[3453.84 --> 3461.04]  and sisters in glory a beautiful bride prepared for her husband enjoying everything and it will never
[3461.04 --> 3470.32]  end the sufferings of this present age are not worthy to be compared to the glory that will be
[3470.32 --> 3474.40]  revealed to each and every one of us who long for jesus christ
[3476.96 --> 3484.16]  so i'm just going to close with this in c.s lewis's book the in the chronicles of narnia the last book of
[3484.16 --> 3490.80]  the series we got aslan the great lion the christ figure he's speaking to all the children who have
[3490.80 --> 3497.68]  gone through all of the trials and the tribulations of narnia and the book ends with these words
[3499.52 --> 3506.32]  the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that i cannot write them
[3506.32 --> 3515.52]  and for us this is the end of all stories and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever
[3515.52 --> 3524.64]  after but for them it was only the beginning of the real story all their life in this world all of
[3524.64 --> 3532.48]  their adventures in narnia had only been the cover and the title page now at last they were beginning
[3532.48 --> 3540.24]  chapter one of the great story which no one on earth has read which goes on forever in which every chapter
[3540.80 --> 3542.56]  is better than the one before it
[3546.16 --> 3551.44]  that's the story of the bible too right that our present sufferings and groanings that we live right
[3551.44 --> 3562.40]  in now are the prelude they are the cover chapter one is still around the around the corner glory
[3562.40 --> 3570.48]  awaits that's the story that god calls us into so let's pray together
[3575.68 --> 3584.00]  our father we thank you for your word which reveals and promises and assures us of future glory
[3584.72 --> 3587.12]  but it also reminds us it's also honest
[3587.12 --> 3596.08]  that in this world we are not going to escape suffering and so lord as the difficulties come and
[3596.08 --> 3605.44]  they will give us the hope in your promise that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with
[3605.44 --> 3613.60]  the glory that will be revealed in us and we pray for the sake of jesus christ our lord amen
[3613.60 --> 3626.00]  well we will sing our song of response which is called from everlasting so let's uh let's rise and we'll sing
[3626.00 --> 3626.88]  together
[3626.88 --> 3648.96]  oh god before the mountains were brought forth
[3648.96 --> 3661.76]  and we so even dive into this
[3662.48 --> 3663.52]  so let's count first

[3668.32 --> 3672.80]  from everlasting jump
[3672.80 --> 3675.94]  in ancient skies.

[4019.64 --> 4021.64]  Amen.
[4021.64 --> 4023.64]  Please join me in prayer.
[4023.64 --> 4039.64]  Dear Lord, on this Reformation Sunday, we thank you for those persons who you have poured your spirit into, that then set about reforming your church.
[4039.64 --> 4049.64]  We thank you that you are still at work in the life of the church, reforming us, reshaping us, and remaking us into your image.
[4049.64 --> 4059.64]  We thank you for the 75 years of service for this congregation that we could celebrate last week, and for the efforts of all those who made that event possible.
[4059.64 --> 4073.64]  It's important to mark these milestones, but also humbling as we celebrate decades for our congregation compared to the hundreds and even thousands of years of your grace and faithfulness to church as a whole.
[4073.64 --> 4081.64]  One of the ways we reflect your image, Lord, is how we care for one another with love, care, and prayer.
[4081.64 --> 4088.64]  We pray for those who are in the hospitals today, and we lift grace you before you.
[4088.64 --> 4092.64]  May you grant healing from her heart and stroke issues.
[4092.64 --> 4099.64]  We pray for those at home with illnesses, pains, and recovering from treatments and their surgeries.
[4099.64 --> 4112.64]  In this, we think of Sean Limas, who has been battling with the effects of Lyme disease, and we pray for success from his trip to Arizona with his mother Wilma and Father Andrew for further treatment.
[4112.64 --> 4118.64]  We think of Mal Rass, who has suffered a recent family loss and now is dealing with health issues.
[4118.64 --> 4122.64]  Please give him strength, healing, and peace.
[4122.64 --> 4131.64]  We pray for those in nursing homes and those who are homebound, and we pray for their families during these times.
[4131.64 --> 4135.64]  We reflect your image in how we love, care, and pray for the world.
[4135.64 --> 4141.64]  We pray for those around the world who, as Christians, face imprisonment and martyrdom.
[4141.64 --> 4147.64]  We pray for those whose countries are torn by civil war or conflict with neighboring countries.
[4147.64 --> 4158.64]  The years-long war in Ukraine that's often in the headlines, and the much less talked about but no less devastating civil war in Sudan, and countless other conflicts around the world.
[4158.64 --> 4170.64]  We pray that leaders in these areas, these regions, can be found who will, through your grace, make real efforts to find peaceful solutions to seemingly intractable differences.
[4170.64 --> 4175.64]  We pray for those living in poverty and in many cases facing starvation.
[4175.64 --> 4178.64]  We don't have to go far to see people in need.
[4178.64 --> 4180.64]  They are right here in our community.
[4180.64 --> 4192.64]  And we pray for the work of organizations like South Delta Food Bank locally and larger aid organizations globally, seeking to reduce the effects of these inequalities in life.
[4192.64 --> 4201.64]  Lord, we pray for your church that we be a beacon of hope, grace, love, and light in this world.
[4201.64 --> 4206.64]  May our open doors reflect your open arms to all.
[4206.64 --> 4212.64]  May our arms and hands reach out to those in need and reflect your love for all.
[4212.64 --> 4218.64]  May our forgiveness of one another reflect your forgiveness for all.
[4218.64 --> 4221.64]  We pray for the impact of Raise Up Global Ministries.
[4221.64 --> 4230.64]  May our financial gifts to them today be well used to equip leaders of all types within your church worldwide.
[4230.64 --> 4233.64]  May our own Lord be near us through this coming week.
[4233.64 --> 4239.64]  May our own Lord help us to be effective servants to you and that the focus of our lives to give you glory and advance your kingdom.
[4239.64 --> 4245.64]  May our kingdom offer these prayers only in the strong and compassionate name of Jesus, the light of the world.
[4245.64 --> 4246.64]  Amen.
[4246.64 --> 4246.86]  Amen.
[4258.70 --> 4259.86]  Let's all stand together
[4259.86 --> 4263.64]  and join us for a time of fellowship.
[4263.76 --> 4265.40]  Right after the service, you're all welcome
[4265.40 --> 4269.26]  right through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[4270.44 --> 4272.22]  And I invite you to hold out your hands
[4272.22 --> 4275.00]  as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[4275.00 --> 4278.00]  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4278.56 --> 4280.24]  and the love of God our Father,
[4280.86 --> 4282.10]  the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[4282.44 --> 4284.78]  be with each and every one of us,
[4285.74 --> 4287.10]  now and forever.
[4287.60 --> 4287.88]  Amen.
[4288.96 --> 4290.12]  And remain standing.
[4290.38 --> 4292.28]  We'll finish, we'll sing our final song.
[4305.00 --> 4312.44]  Praise the Lord,
[4312.44 --> 4317.60]  from whom all blessings flow.
[4319.60 --> 4329.12]  He has washed and made me white as snow.
[4329.12 --> 4335.38]  I'm redeemed
[4335.38 --> 4341.38]  from all my sin and shame
[4341.38 --> 4346.62]  now and forever.
[4346.62 --> 4353.06]  Praise His holy name.
[4353.06 --> 4358.94]  Praise His holy name.
[4358.94 --> 4364.20]  Praise His holy name.
[4364.34 --> 4367.32]  To God be the glory,
[4367.86 --> 4370.00]  now and forever.
[4370.68 --> 4374.06]  Praise His holy name.
[4374.06 --> 4380.50]  Praise the Lord,
[4380.50 --> 4385.88]  from whom all blessings flow.
[4385.88 --> 4396.84]  He has washed and made me white as snow.
[4396.84 --> 4407.28]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[4407.28 --> 4408.22]  I'm redeemed from all my sin and shame.
[4408.22 --> 4413.38]  Now and forever.
[4413.38 --> 4419.28]  Praise His holy name.
[4419.28 --> 4424.28]  Praise His holy name.
[4424.28 --> 4430.54]  Praise His holy name.
[4430.72 --> 4433.66]  To God be the glory,
[4433.66 --> 4436.26]  now and forever.
[4436.26 --> 4440.72]  Praise His holy name.
[4440.72 --> 4444.80]  To God be the glory,
[4444.80 --> 4447.80]  now and forever.
[4448.50 --> 4452.72]  Praise His holy name.
[4452.72 --> 4454.34]  Praise His holy name.
[4454.34 --> 4457.24]  Praise His holy name.
[4457.24 --> 4482.18]  Praise His holy name.
[4482.18 --> 4484.18]  Amen.
