[0.00 --> 8.14]  Good morning.
[10.10 --> 15.78]  This morning before Pastor Jason comes to welcome us, we are going to sing a song, There's
[15.78 --> 17.24]  a Wideness in God's Mercy.
[17.46 --> 24.70]  And this week I was just thinking about how we all come with such different backgrounds,
[24.70 --> 27.00]  different weeks that we've gone through.
[27.00 --> 34.14]  And it's really good at the beginning of a service just to remember that no matter what's
[34.14 --> 40.50]  gone on in our week, no matter how we failed or no matter what difficulties we've faced,
[40.76 --> 43.66]  God's mercy and his love is so great.
[43.90 --> 50.44]  And this sort of sets the tone for how we respond, how we listen and how we open our hearts to
[50.44 --> 50.66]  him.
[50.90 --> 52.24]  So please sing with us.
[57.00 --> 78.34]  There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, like the Wideness of the Sea.
[78.34 --> 86.38]  There's a kindness in God's justice, which is more than liberty.
[87.44 --> 96.14]  There is no place where so many of us are more felt than up in heaven.
[96.48 --> 104.34]  There is no place where first families have such kindly judgment gave.
[104.34 --> 105.34]  There is no place where so many of us are more felt than us.
[105.34 --> 111.34]  There is no place where so many of us are more felt than us.
[111.48 --> 120.52]  For the love of God is broader than the measures of the light.
[120.52 --> 128.52]  And the heart of the eternal is most wonderfully God.
[129.52 --> 133.16]  Make our love, O God more faithful.
[134.16 --> 137.52]  Let us take you at your word.
[138.62 --> 146.84]  And our lives will be thanksgiving for the goodness of the Lord.
[150.52 --> 161.58]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[162.02 --> 165.10]  I'll add my welcome to Marian's as well.
[166.42 --> 169.20]  Welcome to worship today at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[169.34 --> 170.64]  My name is Jason Truel.
[170.68 --> 171.54]  I'm the lead pastor here.
[172.14 --> 176.86]  It's my delight to welcome you this morning, especially if you are a guest or a visitor here
[176.86 --> 179.58]  today, we are so glad that you are here.
[180.32 --> 182.70]  And so we have these welcome cards.
[182.80 --> 187.80]  I don't draw our attention to these very often, but in the pew in front of you, you should find
[187.80 --> 188.92]  one of these welcome cards.
[189.02 --> 193.82]  And if you are new, we'd love to welcome you, get to know you, and invite you to fill out
[193.82 --> 194.48]  one of these.
[194.88 --> 199.18]  And later in the service, during the offering, you can just drop it into the offering bag.
[199.56 --> 201.64]  And that's how you can pass that on to us.
[201.64 --> 208.70]  So today is kind of a big day for me, for us, because we will be wrapping up our sermon
[208.70 --> 212.36]  series in the book of Romans, finishing up Romans chapter 8.
[212.46 --> 215.50]  And we had started this series over a year ago, last fall.
[216.78 --> 223.04]  And so that will bring us actually next week into a whole new year in the church calendar
[223.04 --> 228.70]  as we enter into Advent and the waiting for Christ to come.
[228.70 --> 235.28]  And so that actually does bring me to one of two important announcements, which is next
[235.28 --> 243.26]  Sunday, being the first Sunday of Advent, as worship committee, we would like you to help
[243.26 --> 249.92]  us with our Advent wreath candle lighting and saying of some of the scriptures.
[250.22 --> 253.36]  So we have a sign-up sheet for you to sign up on.
[253.50 --> 255.36]  So we're going to need someone for next week.
[255.36 --> 256.20]  So don't be shy.
[256.58 --> 259.06]  Please sign up today to do that.
[259.14 --> 262.10]  And so this could be a family and the whole family could come up together.
[262.42 --> 266.90]  Or it could be two or three friends who want to do it together as well.
[267.02 --> 270.28]  So please think about it, pray about it, talk about it, and sign up.
[271.08 --> 277.10]  The second really important announcement is it's that time of year when we have our faith
[277.10 --> 277.88]  promise giving.
[277.88 --> 281.96]  And so you have received forms in your mailbox.
[282.26 --> 283.40]  It was sent out by email.
[283.90 --> 290.60]  And this is a way for you to prayerfully consider how God is calling you to give to him his work
[290.60 --> 292.22]  for the coming year.
[292.32 --> 295.70]  And that helps us as a church for budgeting purposes.
[296.28 --> 300.26]  So please do receive that, pray about it.
[300.26 --> 306.22]  And we will be turning those in, collecting them next week, okay, on November 30th.
[306.42 --> 307.78]  So please do take note of that.
[310.42 --> 315.26]  So now let us prepare our hearts as we continue to worship God.
[315.26 --> 322.84]  And in our call to worship, we're reminded that we come into his presence because he calls
[322.84 --> 324.64]  us as his people to worship him.
[325.38 --> 332.46]  So we come this morning with that conviction, with that assurance that God is here, that he
[332.46 --> 339.08]  is with each of us, and that he loves us more deeply than we could ever imagine.
[339.08 --> 346.62]  So people of God, the Lord calls us this morning to worship from Psalm 99 and Psalm 73.
[347.24 --> 348.54]  And I will begin.
[349.58 --> 353.08]  The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble.
[353.76 --> 358.48]  He sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake.
[359.18 --> 360.72]  God is the Lord in Zion.
[361.38 --> 363.50]  He is exalted over all the nations.
[364.24 --> 366.74]  Let them praise your great and awesome name.
[366.74 --> 369.22]  He is holy together.
[370.22 --> 372.44]  Whom have I in heaven but you?
[373.04 --> 376.56]  And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
[377.08 --> 385.22]  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[385.94 --> 388.06]  Would you join me in a prayer of adoration?
[388.52 --> 389.28]  Let's pray together.
[390.38 --> 394.12]  Our gracious God and our Father in heaven,
[394.12 --> 397.28]  you, Lord, are the one true and living God.
[397.60 --> 400.20]  You sit enthroned in the highest heaven,
[400.74 --> 403.54]  and all the nations praise your name.
[404.52 --> 406.54]  And we, Lord, this morning, as your people,
[406.84 --> 408.66]  bought with the precious blood of Christ,
[408.80 --> 410.56]  we turn our eyes to you.
[411.70 --> 413.48]  We lift up our hearts to you.
[413.56 --> 417.20]  We put our hope in you because you are our strength and our portion.
[417.20 --> 422.12]  Holy Spirit, come now to open our eyes.
[422.68 --> 426.28]  Come now to unstop our ears and to work in our hearts.
[426.70 --> 429.34]  Lord, because we desire this morning to see,
[430.08 --> 431.84]  we desire to hear from you,
[432.48 --> 434.56]  and we desire to know Jesus Christ better.
[435.12 --> 437.32]  And we ask that you would use all of this service,
[437.44 --> 440.62]  all that we do, Lord, as means of grace to that end
[440.62 --> 442.78]  and for your glory alone.
[442.78 --> 445.72]  And we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ,
[445.96 --> 448.74]  our Lord, our rock, and our Redeemer.
[449.58 --> 451.84]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[452.70 --> 456.40]  Let's stand and let's hear God's greeting to us.
[456.50 --> 458.94]  God has called us, and now he greets us with these words,
[459.74 --> 463.20]  to all who are loved by God and called to be his holy people,
[463.78 --> 466.94]  grace and peace to you from God, our Father,
[467.40 --> 469.18]  and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[469.18 --> 472.42]  Let's turn and let's greet all of those around us.
[472.42 --> 473.42]  Amen.
[473.42 --> 473.82]  Amen.
[473.82 --> 474.02]  Amen.
[474.02 --> 474.42]  Amen.
[474.42 --> 474.46]  Amen.
[474.46 --> 474.50]  Amen.
[474.50 --> 474.58]  Amen.
[474.58 --> 475.18]  Amen.
[475.18 --> 475.42]  Amen.
[475.42 --> 475.46]  Amen.
[475.46 --> 475.50]  Amen.
[499.18 --> 500.18]  Amen.
[500.18 --> 500.60]  Amen.
[504.50 --> 506.08]  Amen.
[506.08 --> 506.48]  Amen.
[506.48 --> 506.54]  Amen.
[506.56 --> 507.06]  Amen.
[507.06 --> 508.20]  Amen.
[514.92 --> 517.38]  Amen.
[517.42 --> 517.94]  Amen.
[517.94 --> 518.44]  Amen.
[518.50 --> 518.84]  Amen.
[518.84 --> 519.38]  Amen.
[519.38 --> 519.54]  Amen.
[519.54 --> 519.62]  Amen.
[519.80 --> 519.90]  Amen.
[519.96 --> 520.06]  Amen.
[520.06 --> 520.48]  Amen.
[520.48 --> 520.90]  Amen.
[525.38 --> 525.44]  Amen.
[525.44 --> 525.80]  Amen.
[525.84 --> 526.34]  Amen.
[526.34 --> 526.46]  Amen.
[527.78 --> 527.84]  Amen.
[527.84 --> 528.30]  Amen.
[528.30 --> 528.38]  Amen.
[528.38 --> 529.14]  Amen.
[529.14 --> 529.16]  Amen.
[529.18 --> 554.08]  Who has held the oceans in His hands?
[554.08 --> 559.48]  Who has covered every grain of sand?
[560.02 --> 565.00]  Pleased and nations, tremble in His voice.
[565.46 --> 570.68]  No creation wants us to rejoice.
[571.80 --> 578.38]  The Lord our God, seated on His throne,
[578.38 --> 582.18]  Come let us adore Him.
[582.58 --> 588.38]  Behold our King, nothing can compare.
[589.66 --> 594.38]  Come let us adore Him.
[594.38 --> 596.38]  Amen.
[603.58 --> 608.38]  Who has given counsel to the Lord?
[609.48 --> 614.32]  Who can question any of His words?
[614.88 --> 619.82]  Who can teach the one who knows our wings?
[619.82 --> 626.28]  Who can feather all His wondrous things?
[626.78 --> 632.82]  Behold our God, seated on His throne,
[633.82 --> 637.12]  Come let us adore Him.
[637.52 --> 642.82]  Behold our King, nothing can compare.
[642.82 --> 649.82]  Come let us adore Him.
[649.82 --> 663.84]  Who has held the nails upon His hands,
[664.34 --> 669.12]  Bearing all the guilt of sinful man,
[669.72 --> 673.82]  God eternal, humble to the great,
[673.82 --> 679.82]  Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign.
[681.82 --> 688.12]  Behold our God, seated on His throne,
[688.52 --> 691.96]  Come let us adore Him.
[692.72 --> 698.82]  Behold our King, nothing can compare.
[698.82 --> 704.82]  Come let us adore Him.
[704.82 --> 722.44]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God awaiting.
[723.82 --> 729.76]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[729.76 --> 735.76]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[735.76 --> 741.76]  Be unto your name.
[741.76 --> 747.76]  Be unto your name.
[748.76 --> 749.76]  Be unto your name.
[749.76 --> 751.76]  Be at a moment.
[751.76 --> 755.76]  You are forever.
[755.76 --> 758.76]  Lord of the ages.
[758.76 --> 759.76]  Lord of the ages.
[759.76 --> 762.76]  God be your time.
[762.76 --> 765.76]  Be our neighbor.
[765.76 --> 768.76]  You are eternal.
[768.76 --> 772.76]  Love everlasting.
[772.76 --> 776.76]  Waiting on fire.
[776.76 --> 783.76]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[783.76 --> 784.76]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[785.76 --> 791.76]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[792.76 --> 797.76]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[797.76 --> 802.76]  Be unto your name.
[802.76 --> 803.76]  Be unto your name.
[803.76 --> 804.76]  Be unto your name.
[804.76 --> 809.76]  Be unto your name.
[809.76 --> 812.76]  Be unto your name.
[812.76 --> 814.76]  We are the broken.
[814.76 --> 817.76]  You are the healer.
[817.76 --> 819.76]  Jesus, reliever.
[819.76 --> 820.76]  Mighty to save.
[820.76 --> 823.76]  You are the love song.
[823.76 --> 825.76]  We'll sing forever.
[825.76 --> 827.76]  You are the love song.
[827.76 --> 828.76]  We'll sing forever.
[828.76 --> 830.76]  We'll sing forever.
[830.76 --> 832.76]  Bowing before you.
[832.76 --> 837.76]  Blessing your name.
[837.76 --> 842.76]  Holy, holy, Lord God almighty.
[842.76 --> 846.76]  Holy, holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty.
[847.76 --> 853.76]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[853.76 --> 859.76]  Highest praises, honor and glory.
[859.76 --> 865.76]  Be unto your name.
[865.76 --> 872.76]  Be unto your name.
[876.76 --> 877.44]  Be seated.
[891.12 --> 893.76]  I was quite struck by the singing just now.
[894.44 --> 895.22]  It was very good singing.
[895.76 --> 900.40]  Our first reading this morning is in the book of Genesis.
[900.40 --> 904.62]  If you'd like to turn in your pew Bible with me, you may.
[906.64 --> 908.70]  And that would be on page 15.
[909.18 --> 911.28]  Page 15 in your pew Bible.
[912.20 --> 914.74]  We're looking at Genesis 22.
[915.30 --> 916.74]  Genesis chapter 22.
[919.96 --> 922.40]  And we will read verses 1 through 14.
[922.40 --> 928.30]  Genesis chapter 22, beginning in verse 1.
[928.30 --> 933.70]  Sometime later, God tested Abraham.
[934.44 --> 938.26]  He said to him, Abraham, here I am, he replied.
[939.04 --> 946.32]  Then God said, take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah.
[946.32 --> 951.48]  Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.
[951.48 --> 955.90]  Early the next morning, Abraham got up and saddled his donkey.
[956.06 --> 958.92]  He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac.
[959.48 --> 965.16]  When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.
[965.16 --> 970.12]  On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
[970.30 --> 974.34]  He said to his servants, stay here with the donkey.
[974.48 --> 977.12]  Will I and the boy go over there?
[977.84 --> 978.92]  He will worship.
[979.16 --> 980.84]  Then we will come back to you.
[981.98 --> 986.48]  Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac.
[986.48 --> 991.54]  And he himself carried the fire and the knife.
[992.44 --> 994.76]  And the two of them went on together.
[995.36 --> 998.42]  Isaac spoke up and said to his father, Abraham, father.
[999.08 --> 999.78]  Yes, my son.
[1000.48 --> 1004.48]  Abraham replied, the fire and the wood are here, Isaac said.
[1004.82 --> 1006.94]  But where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
[1008.14 --> 1012.96]  Abraham answered, God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.
[1013.46 --> 1015.24]  And the two of them went on together.
[1015.24 --> 1021.80]  When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it.
[1022.16 --> 1026.34]  He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
[1026.92 --> 1030.62]  Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[1031.16 --> 1035.44]  But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, Abraham, Abraham.
[1036.30 --> 1037.82]  Here I am, he replied.
[1038.26 --> 1040.42]  Do not lay a hand on the boy, he said.
[1040.72 --> 1042.04]  Do not do anything to him.
[1042.36 --> 1044.68]  Now I know that you fear God.
[1044.68 --> 1051.12]  Because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.
[1051.80 --> 1056.10]  Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns.
[1056.42 --> 1061.80]  He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
[1062.44 --> 1066.36]  So Abraham called that place the Lord will provide.
[1066.36 --> 1072.52]  And to this day it is said, on the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.
[1073.38 --> 1074.54]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1074.54 --> 1083.16]  And that mountain, Moria, is actually the same mountain as Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
[1083.16 --> 1090.24]  Now our God has spoken to us.
[1090.40 --> 1092.72]  He has welcomed us into his presence.
[1093.68 --> 1102.64]  And being in the presence of the Holy God, it prompts us to then acknowledge and confess the ways that we fall short of God's glory.
[1102.64 --> 1106.46]  And the way that we sin against him.
[1106.92 --> 1110.32]  And so we have a time now of silent confession.
[1110.86 --> 1114.22]  And then after that we will have a time of corporate confession.
[1114.58 --> 1116.12]  As we pray together.
[1116.68 --> 1118.16]  So first, silent confession.
[1118.40 --> 1122.68]  And what I want to do is I'm going to read some verses from Romans chapter 6.
[1122.68 --> 1124.70]  As a call to confession.
[1125.02 --> 1126.90]  As some verses for us to reflect on.
[1127.54 --> 1131.64]  And as I read, I want to invite you to listen to the Holy Spirit.
[1132.64 --> 1135.86]  Ask him to convict your heart.
[1136.86 --> 1138.90]  Okay, so let me read this for us.
[1140.36 --> 1149.00]  Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.
[1149.00 --> 1157.12]  Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness.
[1157.80 --> 1166.60]  But rather, offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life.
[1167.70 --> 1175.22]  And offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
[1179.00 --> 1183.44]  So I invite you now to have a conversation with the triune God.
[1184.30 --> 1186.06]  Turn to Jesus in confession.
[1186.32 --> 1189.42]  Knowing that he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins.
[1189.92 --> 1191.92]  And to cleanse you from all unrighteousness.
[1192.22 --> 1192.64]  Let's pray.
[1192.64 --> 1192.72]  Amen.
[1192.72 --> 1192.76]  Amen.
[1192.76 --> 1192.80]  Amen.
[1192.80 --> 1192.84]  Amen.
[1192.84 --> 1192.88]  Amen.
[1192.88 --> 1192.92]  Amen.
[1192.92 --> 1192.96]  Amen.
[1192.96 --> 1194.84]  Amen.
[1194.84 --> 1194.88]  Amen.
[1194.88 --> 1196.84]  Amen.
[1196.84 --> 1196.88]  Amen.
[1196.88 --> 1196.92]  Amen.
[1196.92 --> 1196.96]  Amen.
[1196.96 --> 1198.96]  Amen.
[1198.96 --> 1199.00]  Amen.
[1199.00 --> 1199.04]  Amen.
[1199.04 --> 1200.96]  Amen.
[1200.96 --> 1201.04]  Amen.
[1201.04 --> 1203.04]  Amen.
[1203.04 --> 1205.04]  Amen.
[1205.04 --> 1205.08]  Amen.
[1205.08 --> 1205.12]  Amen.
[1205.12 --> 1207.08]  Amen.
[1207.08 --> 1207.12]  Amen.
[1207.12 --> 1208.98]  Amen.
[1209.00 --> 1232.30]  O Lord, as we think about each and every part of who you've made us to be, Lord, you call
[1232.30 --> 1235.82]  us to offer every part to you.
[1235.82 --> 1236.34]  Amen.
[1236.34 --> 1236.78]  Amen.
[1236.78 --> 1237.50]  Amen.
[1237.50 --> 1237.82]  Amen.
[1237.82 --> 1238.84]  Amen.
[1238.84 --> 1245.50]  desires our actions our motivations everything Lord and so Lord would you
[1245.50 --> 1250.18]  convict us of those places that we are keeping back and Lord would you change
[1250.18 --> 1257.14]  us that we might be offer our whole selves to you because of your love for
[1257.14 --> 1264.46]  us and we pray in Jesus name Amen and now having asked the spirit to convict us
[1264.46 --> 1269.32]  of our sins privately let's now confess our sins corporately and that is just a
[1269.32 --> 1273.52]  reminder that all of us are in need of God's mercy so let's confess our sins
[1273.52 --> 1280.00]  together with these words most merciful God we confess that we have sinned
[1280.00 --> 1286.72]  against you in thought word and deed by what we have done and by what we have
[1286.72 --> 1293.32]  left undone we have not loved you with our whole heart we have not loved our
[1293.32 --> 1300.76]  neighbors as ourselves we are truly sorry and we humbly repent for the sake of
[1300.76 --> 1308.08]  your son Jesus Christ have mercy on us and forgive us that we may delight in your
[1308.08 --> 1316.16]  will and walk in your ways to the glory of your name Amen now I want to invite
[1316.16 --> 1321.64]  you to stand and receive these words of assurance from the God who loves you and
[1321.64 --> 1329.50]  who has made provision for your forgiveness but God demonstrates his own
[1329.50 --> 1336.34]  love for us in this while we were still sinners Christ died for us so let's sing
[1336.34 --> 1341.28]  of that mercy together in another song
[1341.28 --> 1371.26]  the love of God is greater far than don't know me can ever tell it goes to me and we're still in the
[1371.26 --> 1378.26]  love of God is greater far than don't know me can ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest
[1378.26 --> 1393.26]  hell and he'll prepare and we'll care and run in his son to win his erring child he reconciled and pardoned from his sin
[1393.26 --> 1415.26]  the love of God the rich and new and the rich and new and the rich and new and the rich and new and strong and strong and shall forever endure the saints and angels song
[1415.26 --> 1433.26]  when years of time shall pass away and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall and men who here refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains
[1433.26 --> 1440.26]  and the rich and new and the mountains God who is not so sure shall still endure
[1440.26 --> 1451.26]  all measure less and strong and may they be grace to heaven's grace and since an angel song
[1451.26 --> 1468.26]  who evermore thou power will evermore follow the rich and new and will measure less and strong and shall forevernd
[1468.26 --> 1480.62]  Could we rethink the ocean filled, and were the skies of parchment made?
[1480.62 --> 1489.70]  Were every star on earth that quail, and every man a scribe I trained?
[1489.70 --> 1498.38]  To write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry.
[1498.38 --> 1506.88]  Nor could this fall contain the whole, and will stretch from sky to sky.
[1507.30 --> 1515.66]  O love of God, how rich and poor, how measureless and strong.
[1515.66 --> 1524.26]  It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.
[1524.26 --> 1533.34]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[1533.68 --> 1542.62]  It shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.
[1545.66 --> 1558.26]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how rich and pure, how rich and pure.
[1558.26 --> 1565.22]  Yes, so the children, teachers, assistants are welcome to go to their class now.
[1565.22 --> 1577.42]  And we are in the book of Romans today.
[1577.42 --> 1581.88]  As I said earlier, we are in Romans chapter 8.
[1582.86 --> 1586.76]  And we will today be reading the very final passage in Romans.
[1586.98 --> 1589.16]  And that would be verses 31 to 39.
[1589.16 --> 1592.60]  So let's turn there together, Romans chapter 8.
[1594.60 --> 1598.24]  And that is on page 841 of your pew Bible.
[1599.66 --> 1605.44]  And in this passage, Paul begins to celebrate.
[1606.68 --> 1612.76]  This passage is kind of like a hymn, where the apostle gathers up all,
[1612.94 --> 1616.72]  everything that he has been saying from chapter 1 to chapter 8,
[1616.72 --> 1622.28]  and he begins to celebrate and proclaim the incomparable, unstoppable,
[1623.06 --> 1627.16]  eternal love of God for us in Christ Jesus.
[1627.90 --> 1629.42]  It's an amazing passage.
[1629.70 --> 1631.48]  It's a familiar passage to many of us.
[1632.10 --> 1635.20]  And I'm excited to look at it with you this morning.
[1636.56 --> 1641.32]  So we'll read Romans chapter 8, beginning in verse 31.
[1641.32 --> 1646.98]  What then shall we say in response to this?
[1647.66 --> 1651.26]  If God is for us, who can be against us?
[1651.86 --> 1655.72]  He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[1656.14 --> 1660.90]  how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
[1661.76 --> 1665.50]  Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[1665.50 --> 1667.96]  It is God who justifies.
[1668.66 --> 1670.34]  Who is he that condemns?
[1670.46 --> 1671.96]  Christ Jesus who died.
[1672.34 --> 1676.88]  More than that, who is raised to life, is at the right hand of God,
[1676.96 --> 1678.82]  and is also interceding for us.
[1680.02 --> 1682.50]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[1683.06 --> 1689.16]  Shall trouble, or hardship, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
[1689.16 --> 1693.76]  As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long,
[1693.90 --> 1696.16]  we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[1697.34 --> 1703.84]  No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[1704.36 --> 1706.92]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[1707.54 --> 1709.14]  neither angels nor demons,
[1709.86 --> 1712.24]  neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[1712.48 --> 1715.86]  neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
[1715.86 --> 1720.54]  will be able to separate us from the love of God
[1720.54 --> 1723.90]  that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[1725.00 --> 1725.60]  Amen.
[1725.88 --> 1726.76]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1732.12 --> 1735.80]  Well, let us be done.
[1736.74 --> 1737.70]  That's all we need.
[1737.78 --> 1739.32]  We just read that a couple more times.
[1739.32 --> 1743.96]  But let's, we'll think about it together a bit.
[1744.06 --> 1745.80]  So let's pray and ask for God's help.
[1745.86 --> 1752.36]  Heavenly Father, we, this morning, thank you for your word,
[1752.50 --> 1757.04]  which is absolutely true and given to us because you love us.
[1757.70 --> 1760.12]  And we pray now that your word would do everything
[1760.12 --> 1763.16]  that you have designed for it to do in and through your people.
[1763.74 --> 1766.44]  And Lord, would you send your Holy Spirit into our hearts,
[1766.96 --> 1770.78]  helping us to hear with the ears of faith
[1770.78 --> 1773.34]  all that you would say to each one of us this morning.
[1774.14 --> 1776.42]  And we pray this in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1776.80 --> 1777.12]  Amen.
[1779.22 --> 1781.28]  Now, I know some of you are golfers.
[1781.48 --> 1782.58]  Who here is a golfer?
[1783.18 --> 1784.12]  Or used to be a golfer?
[1784.40 --> 1785.08]  A couple of you.
[1785.42 --> 1786.54]  I used to be a golfer.
[1786.54 --> 1789.26]  But even if you're not a golfer,
[1789.58 --> 1792.94]  you surely have heard of the name Tiger Woods,
[1793.36 --> 1795.48]  one of the greatest golfers of all times.
[1796.50 --> 1802.20]  And in 2005, Tiger Woods won the Masters Tournament.
[1802.42 --> 1804.62]  And so there's a picture up here.
[1804.62 --> 1808.98]  And this win of the Masters in 2005
[1808.98 --> 1812.72]  produced one of the most iconic moments in golf history.
[1813.36 --> 1815.54]  It was on the 16th hole.
[1816.70 --> 1820.52]  And Tiger Woods faced a really, really difficult chip shot.
[1821.16 --> 1822.64]  He had a tough lie.
[1822.82 --> 1826.38]  It was kind of right off on the edge of the green there.
[1826.38 --> 1830.94]  And it was far from the hole.
[1831.08 --> 1833.22]  And the green had quite a steep slope to it.
[1833.74 --> 1835.54]  So basically, it was an impossible shot.
[1836.08 --> 1839.78]  But he hits the ball just perfectly onto the green.
[1839.90 --> 1843.42]  And the green, the ball hits the green, pauses,
[1843.68 --> 1849.14]  and then takes a sharp right and rolls slowly, slowly, slowly
[1849.14 --> 1853.48]  towards the hole and right to the cup
[1853.48 --> 1856.76]  where the ball pauses right on the lip of the cup.
[1857.18 --> 1858.26]  Everyone's holding their breath.
[1858.86 --> 1859.78]  And it drops in.
[1860.64 --> 1862.84]  And the crowd erupts.
[1863.76 --> 1867.72]  And of course, this led to him winning the tournament.
[1868.64 --> 1872.76]  And that picture there of the ball right before it dropped in,
[1873.52 --> 1876.04]  Nike was extremely excited about this.
[1876.04 --> 1880.00]  Because you can see at the bottom of the ball,
[1880.38 --> 1882.08]  the Nike swoosh, right?
[1882.28 --> 1885.24]  And it was this huge advertising opportunity for Nike.
[1885.38 --> 1888.50]  And that picture was plastered everywhere for months
[1888.50 --> 1890.42]  after that game.
[1891.38 --> 1893.06]  Now, why do I bring this up this morning?
[1893.52 --> 1897.00]  Well, Nike, does anybody know where that comes from?
[1898.14 --> 1901.24]  It's not the last name of the founder of the company.
[1901.36 --> 1903.16]  It's not like Banstra Transportation.
[1903.16 --> 1909.72]  Okay, it's actually a Greek word that means victory.
[1911.02 --> 1913.70]  Nike is a Greek word that means victory.
[1914.52 --> 1917.86]  And it's the same word that Paul uses in our passage
[1917.86 --> 1920.16]  where it's translated conqueror.
[1921.22 --> 1923.54]  Okay, except victory, conqueror,
[1923.76 --> 1926.60]  it's not quite enough for all that Paul wants to say.
[1926.94 --> 1929.08]  So in verse 37, this is what he does.
[1929.08 --> 1934.68]  He says, no, in all these things we are more than conquerors.
[1936.04 --> 1936.64]  Hypernikeo.
[1937.78 --> 1938.30]  Hypernikeo.
[1938.38 --> 1940.40]  We are more than conquerors,
[1941.20 --> 1942.36]  super conquerors,
[1942.94 --> 1944.44]  through him who loved us.
[1944.44 --> 1947.54]  He's saying that, you know,
[1947.60 --> 1951.26]  in the midst of all that he's been talking about,
[1951.34 --> 1954.28]  of the suffering, the trials, the dangers,
[1955.04 --> 1957.86]  of the frustrations and the fears of this life
[1957.86 --> 1960.14]  that we face as Christians in the world,
[1960.54 --> 1963.96]  he says we are not just people who are scraping by,
[1964.96 --> 1966.14]  but we triumph.
[1966.68 --> 1969.32]  We are conquerors,
[1969.32 --> 1971.70]  and it's a resounding victory.
[1972.96 --> 1974.76]  And then what's most amazing about this
[1974.76 --> 1977.44]  is that actually it's written in the present tense.
[1978.24 --> 1982.50]  It's not someday we will be conquerors,
[1983.20 --> 1984.32]  though that is true enough,
[1984.66 --> 1988.02]  but you are a conqueror right now.
[1988.82 --> 1989.06]  Right?
[1989.12 --> 1990.32]  You are someone who,
[1991.08 --> 1993.64]  dare I say it and sound Pentecostal,
[1993.64 --> 1997.16]  but you live victorious life.
[1998.46 --> 1998.60]  Right?
[1998.66 --> 2001.12]  You live the victorious life right now.
[2003.32 --> 2005.60]  And so the question for us this morning is,
[2005.70 --> 2007.12]  well, okay, that sounds great,
[2007.92 --> 2009.48]  but how do you get to be like that?
[2010.10 --> 2010.30]  Right?
[2010.32 --> 2013.66]  How can you and I live the victorious life?
[2014.34 --> 2016.26]  How can we be more than conquerors?
[2016.72 --> 2019.60]  Well, notice what Paul says here at the end of verse 37.
[2019.60 --> 2020.00]  He says,
[2020.10 --> 2022.50]  in all these things we are more than conquerors.
[2022.58 --> 2022.84]  How?
[2023.64 --> 2027.38]  Through him who loved us.
[2028.74 --> 2031.40]  Okay, and this is so important for us to know.
[2032.30 --> 2033.98]  You know, because I think for a lot of us,
[2034.02 --> 2035.60]  you know, we tend to think like this.
[2035.64 --> 2036.20]  We say, okay,
[2036.38 --> 2039.46]  the thing that is going to get me through this life,
[2039.80 --> 2042.10]  through all of the trials,
[2042.48 --> 2044.28]  the tough things of life that I face,
[2044.42 --> 2047.18]  is going to be the strength of my love for God.
[2047.86 --> 2050.04]  If I just love God enough,
[2050.32 --> 2053.42]  I will get through everything that I'm facing.
[2054.42 --> 2055.64]  But when you read the Bible,
[2055.76 --> 2057.98]  you realize that's not the emphasis at all.
[2058.70 --> 2058.90]  Right?
[2058.94 --> 2061.34]  It's not the strength of your love for God.
[2061.54 --> 2063.80]  Rather, it's having the confidence
[2063.80 --> 2065.22]  and the assurance
[2065.22 --> 2067.84]  of the strength of his love for you.
[2068.90 --> 2069.10]  Right?
[2069.10 --> 2073.08]  That's the thing that is going to make you more than conquerors.
[2073.68 --> 2075.64]  And that's what this passage is all about this morning.
[2076.64 --> 2078.04]  How can you know?
[2078.54 --> 2081.82]  How can you have the assurance that God will stick with you?
[2082.76 --> 2082.96]  Right?
[2083.00 --> 2085.48]  That God will love you,
[2085.84 --> 2089.26]  even in the midst of all the pains and trials and sufferings,
[2089.26 --> 2092.82]  and to know that his love won't let you go.
[2093.60 --> 2095.94]  That his love will never let you go.
[2096.76 --> 2097.64]  How can you know that?
[2098.04 --> 2100.78]  And so Paul, he wants to give us that assurance,
[2100.78 --> 2103.16]  and he then,
[2103.32 --> 2107.16]  he goes on to ask and to answer a set of four questions.
[2108.24 --> 2110.68]  And each of these questions has to do
[2110.68 --> 2115.50]  with things that we think may keep us from the love of God.
[2115.70 --> 2117.78]  Things that may come between us
[2117.78 --> 2120.28]  and separate us from the love of God.
[2120.28 --> 2123.34]  So, and those four things are fear,
[2124.22 --> 2126.02]  worry, guilt, and suffering.
[2126.38 --> 2127.34]  So that's what we're going to do
[2127.34 --> 2130.14]  as we look through and look at each of these.
[2130.28 --> 2132.78]  So the first one is fear.
[2132.96 --> 2136.80]  The love of God conquers our fear.
[2137.64 --> 2138.98]  Okay, the love of God conquers our fear.
[2139.10 --> 2140.36]  And in verse 31,
[2140.62 --> 2143.08]  this is what Paul says as he begins this passage.
[2143.08 --> 2146.28]  What then shall we say in response to these things?
[2146.46 --> 2147.38]  What are these things?
[2147.84 --> 2148.96]  Everything he's been saying
[2148.96 --> 2150.46]  in the book of Romans.
[2151.72 --> 2152.40]  And he says,
[2153.76 --> 2155.00]  if God is for us,
[2155.60 --> 2158.00]  who can be against us?
[2159.18 --> 2161.32]  Okay, so now when Paul asked that question,
[2161.42 --> 2162.64]  and we might ask that question,
[2162.90 --> 2164.18]  who can be against us?
[2164.94 --> 2167.26]  There's a sense in which we can say,
[2167.84 --> 2169.48]  well, actually quite a lot.
[2171.00 --> 2171.52]  Right?
[2171.68 --> 2173.10]  Who can be against us?
[2173.28 --> 2176.02]  A lot of things can be against us, right?
[2177.08 --> 2178.72]  You know, in a few verses down,
[2178.72 --> 2179.62]  in verse 35,
[2179.88 --> 2182.74]  Paul begins to list all of these things
[2182.74 --> 2184.14]  that we might be afraid of,
[2184.20 --> 2186.74]  things that are against us.
[2187.30 --> 2188.68]  He mentions trouble.
[2189.54 --> 2190.38]  We all face trouble.
[2191.22 --> 2191.66]  Hardship.
[2192.66 --> 2193.10]  Persecution.
[2193.34 --> 2193.72]  Famine.
[2194.10 --> 2194.54]  Nakedness.
[2194.66 --> 2194.98]  Danger.
[2195.22 --> 2195.52]  Sword.
[2195.52 --> 2199.16]  And this isn't just like a hypothetical list
[2199.16 --> 2201.68]  that he's just kind of pulling out of thin air.
[2201.68 --> 2204.36]  These are all things that Paul has actually endured
[2204.36 --> 2206.22]  for the sake of Christ.
[2207.86 --> 2210.88]  And that list is not comprehensive at all.
[2210.96 --> 2212.24]  It's not exhaustive.
[2212.38 --> 2214.90]  There's all kinds of things that could be against us.
[2215.00 --> 2218.12]  The devil and this world are against us,
[2218.12 --> 2220.46]  and they are against Christ's church.
[2220.46 --> 2223.72]  But the point Paul is making
[2223.72 --> 2227.14]  is not really that there can never be anything against us.
[2227.26 --> 2229.74]  The point is that if God is for us,
[2230.38 --> 2234.64]  can any of those things ultimately harm us?
[2235.58 --> 2238.66]  Can any of those things ultimately destroy us?
[2239.48 --> 2239.58]  Right?
[2239.62 --> 2242.20]  Can any of those things actually separate us
[2242.20 --> 2243.50]  from the love of God
[2243.50 --> 2245.80]  and keep us from,
[2246.16 --> 2249.08]  keep God from accomplishing his purposes in our lives?
[2249.64 --> 2252.78]  Which, as we saw last week in the previous verses,
[2253.02 --> 2255.66]  is to conform us into the image of Christ
[2255.66 --> 2256.94]  and to bring us to glory.
[2258.32 --> 2260.50]  And the answer is a resounding no.
[2260.96 --> 2263.70]  None of these things can actually stop God.
[2264.64 --> 2265.84]  So Paul is arguing,
[2266.00 --> 2266.56]  he's like, you know,
[2266.78 --> 2268.08]  that big measuring scale
[2268.08 --> 2269.34]  that we actually also saw
[2269.34 --> 2271.14]  at the beginning of chapter 8.
[2271.88 --> 2273.92]  God's got this big measuring scale,
[2274.24 --> 2277.08]  and God's here on one side with us.
[2277.16 --> 2278.26]  God is for you.
[2278.94 --> 2279.24]  Okay?
[2279.48 --> 2280.78]  And then Paul is saying,
[2280.94 --> 2281.90]  then it doesn't really matter
[2281.90 --> 2284.42]  what is on the other side.
[2284.62 --> 2286.74]  It doesn't matter if the whole world
[2286.74 --> 2288.98]  and the devil and people
[2288.98 --> 2292.36]  and powers and whatever else
[2292.36 --> 2293.84]  is on the other side.
[2293.84 --> 2295.28]  It can do its worst,
[2296.08 --> 2297.04]  and none of it matters.
[2297.98 --> 2299.68]  You don't have to be afraid
[2299.68 --> 2302.04]  because God is on your side.
[2302.28 --> 2304.76]  And when God is on your side,
[2304.82 --> 2305.70]  you are in the majority.
[2307.48 --> 2307.64]  Okay?
[2308.60 --> 2309.94]  God is for you.
[2311.94 --> 2312.88]  Eugene Peterson,
[2313.20 --> 2315.34]  one of my favorite writers,
[2315.98 --> 2318.48]  especially about pastoral ministry,
[2318.48 --> 2320.12]  he died,
[2320.22 --> 2321.98]  I guess it's been seven years ago now.
[2322.68 --> 2323.72]  And his son,
[2324.32 --> 2324.64]  Leif,
[2325.10 --> 2326.36]  said at the funeral
[2326.36 --> 2328.46]  that his dad really only had one sermon.
[2329.78 --> 2330.88]  Out of, you know,
[2331.54 --> 2332.98]  almost 30 years of ministry,
[2333.14 --> 2334.94]  all the books that he wrote,
[2335.54 --> 2337.02]  he said he had everybody fooled,
[2338.08 --> 2338.56]  Leif said.
[2338.56 --> 2339.50]  He said,
[2339.54 --> 2342.70]  my dad really just had one message.
[2343.42 --> 2344.16]  And I know it
[2344.16 --> 2346.46]  because he whispered it over my life.
[2347.12 --> 2348.46]  Even when I was a young child,
[2348.76 --> 2349.96]  he would say to me,
[2350.30 --> 2351.08]  God loves you,
[2351.92 --> 2353.50]  God is on your side,
[2354.20 --> 2355.70]  he is coming after you,
[2356.30 --> 2357.22]  and he is relentless.
[2357.22 --> 2360.16]  God loves you,
[2360.46 --> 2361.40]  God is on your side,
[2361.64 --> 2362.64]  he is coming after you,
[2362.88 --> 2363.60]  and he is relentless.
[2365.20 --> 2366.14]  And Paul is saying,
[2366.34 --> 2367.12]  if that is true,
[2367.48 --> 2368.84]  which it absolutely is,
[2369.60 --> 2371.20]  then what are you afraid of?
[2373.38 --> 2373.68]  Right?
[2373.80 --> 2375.86]  What can you possibly fear?
[2376.38 --> 2378.06]  What are you worried about?
[2378.30 --> 2379.22]  Why are you troubled?
[2379.36 --> 2380.22]  Why are you stressed?
[2381.52 --> 2383.44]  And even if the very thing
[2383.44 --> 2385.54]  that you are most afraid of happens,
[2385.54 --> 2387.48]  the illness,
[2388.66 --> 2389.50]  the betrayal,
[2390.34 --> 2391.34]  the loneliness,
[2392.12 --> 2392.76]  the loss,
[2392.86 --> 2393.50]  whatever it is,
[2393.56 --> 2394.34]  even then,
[2395.00 --> 2396.56]  you can know that God is for you.
[2399.52 --> 2400.40]  So the first,
[2401.38 --> 2402.64]  the love of God conquers,
[2402.68 --> 2403.46]  the first thing it conquers
[2403.46 --> 2404.08]  is our fear,
[2404.20 --> 2404.78]  and then secondly,
[2404.90 --> 2405.90]  the love of God conquers
[2405.90 --> 2407.20]  our worries.
[2408.64 --> 2408.80]  Okay?
[2408.88 --> 2410.28]  So Paul goes on in verse 32.
[2410.90 --> 2411.42]  He says,
[2412.00 --> 2414.14]  he who did not spare his own son
[2414.14 --> 2415.34]  but gave him up for us all,
[2415.54 --> 2417.84]  how will he not also along with him
[2417.84 --> 2421.90]  graciously give us all things?
[2423.70 --> 2424.98]  And so this question
[2424.98 --> 2427.24]  is addressing our worries,
[2427.44 --> 2430.06]  our anxieties about our life,
[2430.14 --> 2430.90]  what we're going to eat,
[2430.98 --> 2431.60]  what we're going to drink,
[2431.66 --> 2432.32]  what we're going to wear,
[2432.42 --> 2433.14]  where we're going to live.
[2434.44 --> 2436.34]  And now this argument is
[2436.34 --> 2438.16]  an argument from greater to lesser,
[2438.28 --> 2438.46]  right?
[2438.46 --> 2439.94]  The argument is
[2439.94 --> 2440.90]  if God gives you
[2440.90 --> 2442.46]  the greatest treasure,
[2442.88 --> 2444.58]  if he gives you the thing
[2444.58 --> 2446.46]  that he loves most
[2446.46 --> 2447.80]  in all of the universe,
[2448.32 --> 2449.20]  then of course,
[2449.28 --> 2449.92]  won't he give you
[2449.92 --> 2450.76]  everything else
[2450.76 --> 2451.48]  that you need,
[2451.58 --> 2452.38]  like all of those
[2452.38 --> 2453.96]  smaller things as well?
[2455.54 --> 2457.44]  And what was the greatest treasure
[2457.44 --> 2459.40]  that God had to give us?
[2459.40 --> 2461.90]  He gave us his son.
[2463.44 --> 2463.58]  Right?
[2463.78 --> 2464.70]  And so Paul here,
[2464.80 --> 2465.98]  he's bringing us to Good Friday.
[2466.32 --> 2467.58]  He's bringing us to the cross.
[2468.40 --> 2470.62]  He who did not spare his own son
[2470.62 --> 2473.12]  but gave him up for us all.
[2474.14 --> 2475.60]  And all the commentators
[2475.60 --> 2477.24]  here point out
[2477.24 --> 2478.24]  that Paul is borrowing
[2478.24 --> 2480.66]  the language of Genesis 22,
[2480.82 --> 2481.74]  which we read earlier.
[2482.18 --> 2483.44]  When we hear the language,
[2483.62 --> 2486.38]  God not sparing his own son,
[2486.38 --> 2487.82]  it brings us back
[2487.82 --> 2488.82]  to the story of Abraham.
[2490.12 --> 2490.36]  Right?
[2490.44 --> 2490.72]  You see,
[2490.82 --> 2491.76]  Abraham was asked
[2491.76 --> 2492.66]  to give up
[2492.66 --> 2494.00]  the one thing
[2494.00 --> 2495.60]  that was most dear
[2495.60 --> 2497.32]  to him in all the world.
[2498.82 --> 2499.76]  There was nothing
[2499.76 --> 2501.20]  more precious to Abraham
[2501.20 --> 2502.90]  than his son Isaac.
[2503.80 --> 2504.32]  Right?
[2504.36 --> 2505.58]  It was his only son.
[2506.20 --> 2507.16]  It was the son
[2507.16 --> 2508.58]  of the promise.
[2508.74 --> 2509.56]  It was a son
[2509.56 --> 2510.96]  miraculously born.
[2512.30 --> 2513.50]  And God is asking him
[2513.50 --> 2514.48]  to do the last thing
[2514.48 --> 2514.86]  in the world
[2514.86 --> 2515.36]  that Abraham
[2515.36 --> 2517.32]  would ever have dreamed
[2517.32 --> 2519.04]  God would ask him to do.
[2520.26 --> 2520.68]  Abraham,
[2520.90 --> 2521.96]  go and take your son,
[2522.02 --> 2522.82]  your only son,
[2522.88 --> 2523.74]  whom you love,
[2524.22 --> 2525.46]  and offer him
[2525.46 --> 2526.42]  there
[2526.42 --> 2527.64]  as a burnt offering.
[2529.22 --> 2530.12]  Now you see,
[2530.24 --> 2532.18]  it's really awful.
[2532.80 --> 2533.52]  It's an awful,
[2533.60 --> 2534.20]  awful thought
[2534.20 --> 2535.16]  of a father
[2535.16 --> 2537.06]  not sparing his son.
[2539.24 --> 2540.08]  But then what
[2540.08 --> 2540.84]  ends up happening?
[2541.42 --> 2541.98]  Well, Abraham
[2541.98 --> 2543.60]  is walking his son Isaac
[2543.60 --> 2544.24]  up the hill,
[2544.24 --> 2546.14]  to give him away.
[2546.64 --> 2547.24]  And as Abraham
[2547.24 --> 2548.20]  is about
[2548.20 --> 2549.22]  to slaughter
[2549.22 --> 2550.78]  his son Isaac,
[2551.20 --> 2551.82]  the angel
[2551.82 --> 2552.30]  of the Lord
[2552.30 --> 2552.70]  appears
[2552.70 --> 2553.78]  and tells him
[2553.78 --> 2554.36]  to stop
[2554.36 --> 2556.30]  and provides a ram
[2556.30 --> 2557.94]  to take his place
[2557.94 --> 2558.60]  as substitute.
[2559.88 --> 2560.46]  And the angel
[2560.46 --> 2560.86]  of the Lord
[2560.86 --> 2561.10]  says,
[2561.20 --> 2561.46]  Abraham,
[2561.64 --> 2562.20]  now I know
[2562.20 --> 2563.26]  that you fear God
[2563.26 --> 2564.08]  because you have
[2564.08 --> 2564.84]  not withheld
[2564.84 --> 2565.66]  from me
[2565.66 --> 2566.50]  your son,
[2566.58 --> 2567.32]  your only son.
[2567.32 --> 2569.42]  And now here
[2569.42 --> 2569.98]  in Romans,
[2570.10 --> 2570.68]  Paul says
[2570.68 --> 2571.48]  on Good Friday,
[2572.18 --> 2572.98]  what we see
[2572.98 --> 2574.02]  is God the Father
[2574.02 --> 2575.42]  walking his son,
[2576.14 --> 2576.88]  Jesus Christ,
[2577.14 --> 2577.96]  up the hill,
[2578.74 --> 2579.70]  the hill of Calvary.
[2580.78 --> 2582.30]  And the only reason
[2582.30 --> 2583.02]  that Isaac
[2583.02 --> 2584.34]  could be spared
[2584.34 --> 2585.42]  that day
[2585.42 --> 2587.24]  in a substitute
[2587.24 --> 2587.70]  given
[2587.70 --> 2588.52]  was because
[2588.52 --> 2590.36]  one day
[2590.36 --> 2590.96]  the true
[2590.96 --> 2591.74]  substitute
[2591.74 --> 2593.44]  would be
[2593.44 --> 2594.26]  Jesus Christ.
[2594.26 --> 2594.34]  Christ.
[2595.50 --> 2596.54]  And so we look
[2596.54 --> 2597.36]  at the cross
[2597.36 --> 2598.72]  and as we look
[2598.72 --> 2599.16]  at the cross
[2599.16 --> 2600.02]  we should be saying,
[2600.18 --> 2600.38]  God,
[2600.54 --> 2601.50]  now I know
[2601.50 --> 2602.34]  that you love me
[2602.34 --> 2604.16]  because you did not
[2604.16 --> 2605.14]  withhold from me
[2605.14 --> 2606.24]  your son,
[2606.38 --> 2607.14]  your only son.
[2608.78 --> 2610.06]  And then if God
[2610.06 --> 2610.72]  would do that
[2610.72 --> 2611.54]  for you,
[2612.66 --> 2613.70]  won't he graciously
[2613.70 --> 2614.18]  give you
[2614.18 --> 2615.00]  everything else
[2615.00 --> 2615.68]  that you need?
[2616.84 --> 2617.06]  Right?
[2617.12 --> 2617.86]  That's Paul's argument.
[2618.08 --> 2618.48]  He's saying
[2618.48 --> 2621.00]  if he's giving up
[2621.00 --> 2622.12]  his greatest treasure
[2622.12 --> 2623.00]  you don't need
[2623.00 --> 2623.42]  to worry
[2623.42 --> 2623.94]  that God
[2623.94 --> 2624.58]  won't give you
[2624.58 --> 2625.60]  everything else
[2625.60 --> 2626.16]  that you need.
[2626.80 --> 2627.30]  He's already
[2627.30 --> 2628.08]  given you everything.
[2628.82 --> 2629.32]  You have
[2629.32 --> 2630.44]  everything in Christ.
[2631.60 --> 2632.12]  And so what that
[2632.12 --> 2632.54]  means is
[2632.54 --> 2633.34]  when we,
[2633.86 --> 2634.40]  you know,
[2634.44 --> 2634.98]  when we're not
[2634.98 --> 2635.72]  getting what we
[2635.72 --> 2636.50]  want in life
[2636.50 --> 2637.20]  or even
[2637.20 --> 2637.86]  when we're
[2637.86 --> 2638.36]  not getting
[2638.36 --> 2638.90]  what we think
[2638.90 --> 2639.72]  we need
[2639.72 --> 2640.34]  in life,
[2641.16 --> 2641.92]  we don't always
[2641.92 --> 2642.58]  know why,
[2642.92 --> 2643.32]  we don't know
[2643.32 --> 2643.84]  the reason,
[2644.22 --> 2645.40]  but we do know
[2645.40 --> 2646.22]  it's not because
[2646.22 --> 2647.08]  God is stingy.
[2648.28 --> 2649.86]  And it can't be
[2649.86 --> 2650.80]  because he doesn't
[2650.80 --> 2651.36]  love us.
[2652.98 --> 2653.84]  Doubt not
[2653.84 --> 2654.40]  his love
[2654.40 --> 2654.98]  for you,
[2655.24 --> 2655.72]  Paul says.
[2656.58 --> 2656.78]  Right?
[2656.86 --> 2657.42]  He's given you
[2657.42 --> 2657.86]  his son.
[2659.20 --> 2659.98]  So that deals
[2659.98 --> 2660.78]  with our worries.
[2661.82 --> 2662.78]  But now thirdly,
[2663.46 --> 2664.50]  what about our guilt?
[2666.14 --> 2666.34]  Right?
[2666.34 --> 2666.90]  What about our guilt?
[2666.98 --> 2667.80]  Won't our sin,
[2667.90 --> 2668.92]  won't our guilt
[2668.92 --> 2670.16]  keep us
[2670.16 --> 2670.96]  from God's love?
[2672.34 --> 2672.74]  Well,
[2672.80 --> 2673.56]  let's look at
[2673.56 --> 2674.50]  verse 33.
[2677.16 --> 2677.98]  Who will bring
[2677.98 --> 2678.88]  any charge
[2678.88 --> 2680.00]  against those
[2680.00 --> 2680.46]  whom God
[2680.46 --> 2681.02]  has chosen?
[2681.02 --> 2681.64]  God
[2681.64 --> 2682.46]  who justifies.
[2683.42 --> 2683.84]  So what's
[2683.84 --> 2684.28]  Paul doing
[2684.28 --> 2684.56]  here?
[2685.20 --> 2685.62]  He's
[2685.62 --> 2687.56]  escorting us
[2687.56 --> 2688.18]  into the
[2688.18 --> 2688.56]  courtroom.
[2689.66 --> 2690.10]  He's bringing
[2690.10 --> 2690.58]  us into the
[2690.58 --> 2690.88]  courtroom.
[2691.24 --> 2692.00]  Who will bring
[2692.00 --> 2693.04]  any charge
[2693.04 --> 2694.16]  against whom
[2694.16 --> 2695.16]  God has chosen?
[2696.44 --> 2697.02]  And this
[2697.02 --> 2697.70]  question
[2697.70 --> 2698.80]  that Paul
[2698.80 --> 2699.22]  asks,
[2699.56 --> 2700.04]  it's
[2700.04 --> 2700.76]  addressing
[2700.76 --> 2701.84]  the Christian
[2701.84 --> 2703.06]  who is unsure
[2703.06 --> 2703.70]  of their
[2703.70 --> 2704.16]  salvation.
[2705.40 --> 2705.64]  Right?
[2705.72 --> 2706.48]  Maybe someone,
[2706.70 --> 2707.40]  maybe you,
[2707.58 --> 2708.04]  yourself,
[2708.04 --> 2709.02]  you are
[2709.02 --> 2709.82]  bringing up
[2709.82 --> 2710.54]  your past
[2710.54 --> 2710.98]  sins.
[2712.82 --> 2713.32]  Right?
[2713.36 --> 2713.66]  Kind of
[2713.66 --> 2714.34]  rubbing your
[2714.34 --> 2714.94]  past sins
[2714.94 --> 2715.38]  in your
[2715.38 --> 2715.78]  face.
[2716.68 --> 2717.10]  Maybe you
[2717.10 --> 2717.78]  feel terrible
[2717.78 --> 2718.48]  about something
[2718.48 --> 2719.32]  that you've
[2719.32 --> 2719.64]  done.
[2720.82 --> 2721.12]  And then
[2721.12 --> 2722.00]  that sense
[2722.00 --> 2722.56]  of guilt
[2722.56 --> 2723.38]  drives us
[2723.38 --> 2723.80]  to think
[2723.80 --> 2724.18]  that maybe
[2724.18 --> 2724.72]  we are not
[2724.72 --> 2725.52]  truly forgiven.
[2726.28 --> 2726.40]  Right?
[2726.46 --> 2726.80]  And maybe
[2726.80 --> 2727.52]  somehow
[2727.52 --> 2728.28]  at the
[2728.28 --> 2728.64]  end,
[2728.94 --> 2729.46]  maybe my
[2729.46 --> 2730.12]  case will
[2730.12 --> 2731.06]  get reopened
[2731.06 --> 2731.88]  and I will
[2731.88 --> 2732.48]  be condemned.
[2734.36 --> 2734.64]  And Paul
[2734.64 --> 2735.10]  says,
[2735.10 --> 2737.68]  there is
[2737.68 --> 2738.20]  no longer
[2738.20 --> 2738.84]  any guilt
[2738.84 --> 2740.34]  because it
[2740.34 --> 2740.84]  is God
[2740.84 --> 2742.08]  who justifies.
[2743.62 --> 2744.16]  In other
[2744.16 --> 2744.50]  words,
[2745.10 --> 2745.68]  he's the
[2745.68 --> 2746.02]  judge,
[2746.14 --> 2746.28]  right?
[2746.38 --> 2746.82]  God is
[2746.82 --> 2747.34]  the judge.
[2747.96 --> 2748.74]  So no
[2748.74 --> 2749.52]  charges can
[2749.52 --> 2750.34]  stick anymore.
[2751.46 --> 2751.96]  Right?
[2752.06 --> 2752.56]  He has
[2752.56 --> 2753.20]  made his
[2753.20 --> 2753.60]  judgment.
[2754.00 --> 2754.32]  You have
[2754.32 --> 2754.96]  been forgiven
[2754.96 --> 2755.68]  and declared
[2755.68 --> 2756.56]  righteous by
[2756.56 --> 2757.08]  God.
[2758.56 --> 2759.42]  So there's
[2759.42 --> 2760.26]  a story
[2760.26 --> 2760.90]  of a doctor
[2760.90 --> 2761.76]  in a
[2761.76 --> 2762.88]  small rural
[2762.88 --> 2763.36]  village.
[2763.36 --> 2765.58]  And this
[2765.58 --> 2765.90]  doctor,
[2766.04 --> 2766.24]  he was
[2766.24 --> 2766.70]  known for
[2766.70 --> 2767.32]  his professional
[2767.32 --> 2768.28]  skill as
[2768.28 --> 2769.48]  a doctor and
[2769.48 --> 2770.24]  also for
[2770.24 --> 2770.88]  his devotion
[2770.88 --> 2771.74]  to Christ.
[2772.72 --> 2773.52]  Now after
[2773.52 --> 2774.30]  his death,
[2774.74 --> 2775.46]  the doctor's
[2775.46 --> 2776.20]  ledgers were
[2776.20 --> 2777.04]  examined and
[2777.04 --> 2778.20]  they listed
[2778.20 --> 2778.70]  all of his
[2778.70 --> 2780.30]  patients and
[2780.30 --> 2781.66]  what they
[2781.66 --> 2782.38]  had owed
[2782.38 --> 2783.02]  the doctor
[2783.02 --> 2783.94]  for his
[2783.94 --> 2784.84]  services.
[2785.98 --> 2786.86]  But several
[2786.86 --> 2787.88]  entries in the
[2787.88 --> 2788.38]  ledger were
[2788.38 --> 2789.08]  quite interesting.
[2789.62 --> 2789.94]  They had
[2789.94 --> 2791.26]  written across
[2791.26 --> 2792.00]  them in big
[2792.00 --> 2792.68]  red ink,
[2792.68 --> 2793.42]  forgiven,
[2794.86 --> 2795.44]  too poor
[2795.44 --> 2795.90]  to pay.
[2797.78 --> 2798.94]  Now after
[2798.94 --> 2799.36]  his death,
[2799.40 --> 2799.88]  unfortunately,
[2800.04 --> 2800.88]  his wife had
[2800.88 --> 2801.66]  a different
[2801.66 --> 2802.20]  mind about
[2802.20 --> 2802.56]  this.
[2803.16 --> 2803.66]  And she
[2803.66 --> 2804.10]  filed a
[2804.10 --> 2804.70]  lawsuit before
[2804.70 --> 2805.10]  the court
[2805.10 --> 2805.70]  seeking to
[2805.70 --> 2806.38]  collect money
[2806.38 --> 2807.72]  from those
[2807.72 --> 2808.68]  who had
[2808.68 --> 2809.22]  not paid.
[2810.28 --> 2810.80]  And so when
[2810.80 --> 2811.48]  the case was
[2811.48 --> 2812.06]  being heard,
[2812.96 --> 2813.62]  the judge
[2813.62 --> 2814.18]  asked her,
[2814.42 --> 2815.02]  is this your
[2815.02 --> 2815.52]  husband's
[2815.52 --> 2817.28]  handwriting in
[2817.28 --> 2818.20]  red here in
[2818.20 --> 2818.60]  the ledger?
[2819.48 --> 2820.02]  She said,
[2820.16 --> 2820.84]  it was.
[2820.84 --> 2821.90]  And so the
[2821.90 --> 2822.38]  judge said,
[2822.48 --> 2822.66]  well,
[2822.96 --> 2823.66]  then not a
[2823.66 --> 2824.14]  court in
[2824.14 --> 2824.74]  the land
[2824.74 --> 2825.60]  can touch
[2825.60 --> 2826.84]  those whom
[2826.84 --> 2827.74]  he has
[2827.74 --> 2828.12]  forgiven.
[2829.86 --> 2830.72]  Not a
[2830.72 --> 2831.34]  court in
[2831.34 --> 2831.80]  the land
[2831.80 --> 2832.62]  can touch
[2832.62 --> 2833.90]  those whom
[2833.90 --> 2834.42]  he has
[2834.42 --> 2834.76]  forgiven.
[2835.68 --> 2836.54]  And Jesus
[2836.54 --> 2837.00]  Christ,
[2837.10 --> 2837.78]  he writes in
[2837.78 --> 2838.42]  bold red
[2838.42 --> 2839.56]  letters across
[2839.56 --> 2840.92]  each of our
[2840.92 --> 2841.46]  lives,
[2842.10 --> 2842.58]  forgiven.
[2844.02 --> 2844.70]  And not a
[2844.70 --> 2845.34]  court in
[2845.34 --> 2846.06]  the land
[2846.06 --> 2847.28]  can touch
[2847.28 --> 2848.32]  those whom
[2848.32 --> 2848.60]  he has
[2848.60 --> 2848.92]  forgiven.
[2848.92 --> 2849.04]  sin.
[2851.44 --> 2851.74]  And then
[2851.74 --> 2852.18]  that's not
[2852.18 --> 2852.50]  all.
[2852.66 --> 2853.40]  Paul goes
[2853.40 --> 2854.16]  on in
[2854.16 --> 2854.78]  verse 34.
[2855.64 --> 2856.10]  He says,
[2856.18 --> 2856.58]  who then
[2856.58 --> 2857.30]  is the
[2857.30 --> 2858.32]  one who
[2858.32 --> 2858.86]  condemns?
[2859.04 --> 2859.78]  No one.
[2861.14 --> 2861.44]  And then he
[2861.44 --> 2861.64]  says,
[2861.76 --> 2862.34]  Christ Jesus
[2862.34 --> 2863.00]  who died
[2863.00 --> 2863.44]  more than
[2863.44 --> 2863.80]  that,
[2864.14 --> 2864.40]  who was
[2864.40 --> 2864.94]  raised to
[2864.94 --> 2865.26]  life,
[2865.76 --> 2866.36]  is at
[2866.36 --> 2866.84]  the right
[2866.84 --> 2867.32]  hand of
[2867.32 --> 2867.70]  God,
[2868.08 --> 2868.34]  and is
[2868.34 --> 2868.60]  also
[2868.60 --> 2869.16]  interceding
[2869.16 --> 2869.68]  for us.
[2870.94 --> 2871.10]  Okay,
[2871.10 --> 2871.38]  so not
[2871.38 --> 2872.60]  only is
[2872.60 --> 2873.04]  it God
[2873.04 --> 2873.64]  himself who
[2873.64 --> 2874.26]  justifies,
[2874.36 --> 2874.82]  the judge
[2874.82 --> 2875.22]  of all
[2875.22 --> 2875.74]  the earth,
[2876.06 --> 2876.62]  the highest
[2876.62 --> 2877.98]  judge of
[2877.98 --> 2878.30]  all,
[2879.12 --> 2879.84]  but then
[2879.84 --> 2880.62]  verse 34
[2880.62 --> 2881.36]  tells us
[2881.36 --> 2882.20]  that Jesus
[2882.20 --> 2882.80]  died,
[2883.12 --> 2884.26]  meaning he
[2884.26 --> 2884.86]  has made
[2884.86 --> 2885.40]  the final
[2885.40 --> 2886.02]  payment for
[2886.02 --> 2886.46]  our sin.
[2887.42 --> 2888.06]  And he
[2888.06 --> 2888.56]  was raised
[2888.56 --> 2889.06]  to life,
[2889.16 --> 2889.94]  meaning he
[2889.94 --> 2890.50]  has broken
[2890.50 --> 2891.04]  the power
[2891.04 --> 2891.56]  of death,
[2892.12 --> 2892.58]  and he
[2892.58 --> 2892.84]  is now
[2892.84 --> 2893.40]  seated at
[2893.40 --> 2893.72]  the right
[2893.72 --> 2894.12]  hand of
[2894.12 --> 2894.78]  God so
[2894.78 --> 2895.28]  that he
[2895.28 --> 2896.00]  has all
[2896.00 --> 2897.20]  power and
[2897.20 --> 2898.96]  authority over
[2898.96 --> 2899.54]  heaven and
[2899.54 --> 2899.86]  earth.
[2900.48 --> 2901.02]  So therefore,
[2901.30 --> 2901.88]  how could
[2901.88 --> 2904.20]  someone possibly
[2904.20 --> 2905.44]  bring a charge
[2905.44 --> 2906.06]  against God's
[2906.06 --> 2906.42]  elect,
[2906.66 --> 2907.12]  his chosen?
[2907.98 --> 2909.14]  How,
[2909.40 --> 2909.76]  think about
[2909.76 --> 2909.94]  it,
[2910.28 --> 2910.98]  to bring
[2910.98 --> 2911.80]  a charge
[2911.80 --> 2912.52]  of sin
[2912.52 --> 2913.54]  or a
[2913.54 --> 2914.06]  charge of
[2914.06 --> 2914.56]  guilt
[2914.56 --> 2915.64]  against a
[2915.64 --> 2915.96]  Christian,
[2916.10 --> 2916.42]  what would
[2916.42 --> 2916.74]  you have
[2916.74 --> 2917.10]  to do
[2917.10 --> 2917.60]  actually?
[2919.70 --> 2920.38]  You would
[2920.38 --> 2920.78]  have to
[2920.78 --> 2921.58]  first void
[2921.58 --> 2922.30]  the cross
[2922.30 --> 2924.32]  and say
[2924.32 --> 2925.80]  that payment
[2925.80 --> 2926.94]  of sin
[2926.94 --> 2927.54]  on the cross
[2927.54 --> 2928.18]  wasn't actually
[2928.18 --> 2928.50]  made.
[2929.26 --> 2929.70]  The cross
[2929.70 --> 2930.22]  didn't do
[2930.22 --> 2930.58]  anything.
[2931.52 --> 2932.08]  And then
[2932.08 --> 2932.76]  you would
[2932.76 --> 2933.12]  have to
[2933.12 --> 2934.00]  overpower
[2934.00 --> 2934.74]  the resurrection.
[2935.18 --> 2935.40]  You would
[2935.40 --> 2936.04]  have to keep
[2936.04 --> 2936.72]  Jesus in
[2936.72 --> 2937.06]  the tomb.
[2937.98 --> 2938.84]  And then
[2938.84 --> 2939.16]  you would
[2939.16 --> 2939.64]  have to
[2939.64 --> 2941.00]  take on
[2941.00 --> 2942.20]  the one
[2942.20 --> 2942.88]  who has
[2942.88 --> 2943.98]  all authority
[2943.98 --> 2944.52]  and power
[2944.52 --> 2945.08]  in the entire
[2945.08 --> 2945.48]  universe.
[2945.60 --> 2945.78]  You would
[2945.78 --> 2946.06]  have to
[2946.06 --> 2946.46]  overthrow
[2946.46 --> 2947.30]  the throne
[2947.30 --> 2947.72]  of God.
[2949.56 --> 2950.34]  And friends,
[2950.44 --> 2951.00]  not even the
[2951.00 --> 2951.76]  gates of hell
[2951.76 --> 2952.98]  have a chance
[2952.98 --> 2954.48]  to do that.
[2956.26 --> 2957.28]  Your guilt,
[2957.48 --> 2958.04]  Paul says,
[2958.42 --> 2960.02]  cannot separate
[2960.02 --> 2961.02]  you from the
[2961.02 --> 2961.46]  love of God
[2961.46 --> 2962.06]  because you
[2962.06 --> 2963.20]  are forgiven
[2963.20 --> 2965.06]  and you
[2965.06 --> 2965.50]  are free.
[2968.50 --> 2969.44]  So lastly
[2969.44 --> 2969.82]  now,
[2969.94 --> 2970.52]  that brings
[2970.52 --> 2971.16]  us to
[2971.16 --> 2971.72]  the question
[2971.72 --> 2973.12]  of suffering.
[2974.38 --> 2975.10]  It's been
[2975.10 --> 2975.56]  said we
[2975.56 --> 2976.16]  are Easter
[2976.16 --> 2976.70]  people
[2976.70 --> 2978.24]  living in
[2978.24 --> 2978.56]  a Good
[2978.56 --> 2978.84]  Friday
[2978.84 --> 2979.28]  world.
[2981.66 --> 2982.28]  What does
[2982.28 --> 2982.70]  that mean?
[2982.92 --> 2983.40]  It means
[2983.40 --> 2984.36]  that you
[2984.36 --> 2984.68]  and I,
[2984.80 --> 2985.04]  we will
[2985.04 --> 2985.64]  face suffering
[2985.64 --> 2985.94]  in this
[2985.94 --> 2986.26]  life.
[2987.12 --> 2987.52]  Jesus
[2987.52 --> 2988.12]  even said
[2988.12 --> 2988.48]  to his
[2988.48 --> 2988.86]  disciples,
[2989.10 --> 2989.44]  in this
[2989.44 --> 2989.90]  world you
[2989.90 --> 2990.38]  will have
[2990.38 --> 2990.68]  trouble.
[2990.68 --> 2992.06]  Jesus
[2992.06 --> 2992.50]  said it.
[2993.98 --> 2994.30]  So the
[2994.30 --> 2994.80]  question that
[2994.80 --> 2995.20]  Paul now
[2995.20 --> 2995.92]  asks and
[2995.92 --> 2997.52]  answers for
[2997.52 --> 2998.86]  us is this
[2998.86 --> 2999.50]  final question
[2999.50 --> 2999.98]  is in verse
[2999.98 --> 3000.40]  35.
[3001.60 --> 3002.16]  He says,
[3002.48 --> 3002.80]  who shall
[3002.80 --> 3003.64]  separate us
[3003.64 --> 3003.88]  from the
[3003.88 --> 3004.16]  love of
[3004.16 --> 3004.54]  Christ?
[3005.74 --> 3005.98]  Shall
[3005.98 --> 3006.40]  trouble,
[3007.04 --> 3007.74]  or hardship,
[3007.94 --> 3008.48]  or persecution,
[3008.68 --> 3009.04]  or famine,
[3009.14 --> 3009.62]  or nakedness,
[3009.64 --> 3010.04]  or danger,
[3010.16 --> 3010.62]  or sword?
[3011.64 --> 3012.16]  Paul is
[3012.16 --> 3012.66]  saying think
[3012.66 --> 3013.40]  of the worst
[3013.40 --> 3014.30]  disasters you
[3014.30 --> 3014.84]  can imagine.
[3015.90 --> 3016.32]  And let's
[3016.32 --> 3017.74]  wonder together
[3017.74 --> 3018.72]  if they can
[3018.72 --> 3019.28]  separate you
[3019.28 --> 3019.54]  from the
[3019.54 --> 3020.02]  love of God.
[3020.68 --> 3021.08]  Right?
[3021.16 --> 3021.46]  What if
[3021.46 --> 3021.74]  there was
[3021.74 --> 3022.16]  a famine?
[3023.98 --> 3024.52]  What if
[3024.52 --> 3025.34]  someone came
[3025.34 --> 3026.06]  with swords
[3026.06 --> 3026.56]  to kill
[3026.56 --> 3026.84]  us?
[3027.90 --> 3028.44]  What if
[3028.44 --> 3029.16]  someone stole
[3029.16 --> 3029.86]  everything we
[3029.86 --> 3030.14]  have?
[3031.50 --> 3032.20]  Maybe one
[3032.20 --> 3032.68]  of those
[3032.68 --> 3033.32]  disasters
[3033.32 --> 3034.22]  would prove
[3034.22 --> 3034.88]  that God's
[3034.88 --> 3035.42]  love is
[3035.42 --> 3036.02]  insufficient.
[3037.74 --> 3038.52]  Then he
[3038.52 --> 3038.92]  kind of
[3038.92 --> 3040.06]  leans in
[3040.06 --> 3040.92]  to the
[3040.92 --> 3041.44]  question of
[3041.44 --> 3041.98]  persecution
[3041.98 --> 3042.42]  in verse
[3042.42 --> 3042.98]  36.
[3043.12 --> 3043.40]  He goes
[3043.40 --> 3043.70]  on.
[3044.36 --> 3045.02]  He quotes
[3045.02 --> 3045.72]  Psalm 44
[3045.72 --> 3047.12]  and says,
[3047.26 --> 3047.70]  as it is
[3047.70 --> 3047.96]  written,
[3048.06 --> 3048.40]  for your
[3048.40 --> 3048.94]  sake we
[3048.94 --> 3049.60]  face death
[3049.60 --> 3050.14]  all day
[3050.14 --> 3050.92]  long we
[3050.92 --> 3051.50]  are considered
[3051.50 --> 3052.02]  as sheep
[3052.02 --> 3052.36]  to be
[3052.36 --> 3053.38]  slaughtered.
[3054.50 --> 3055.14]  You know,
[3055.24 --> 3055.88]  in the
[3055.88 --> 3056.52]  Old Testament
[3056.52 --> 3057.32]  you read
[3057.32 --> 3057.80]  about the
[3057.80 --> 3058.32]  suffering of
[3058.32 --> 3060.30]  Israel and
[3060.30 --> 3060.74]  you come to
[3060.74 --> 3061.24]  realize they're
[3061.24 --> 3061.88]  actually suffering
[3061.88 --> 3062.48]  for their own
[3062.48 --> 3063.26]  sin, their own
[3063.26 --> 3064.28]  idolatry, turning
[3064.28 --> 3064.96]  away from God.
[3065.44 --> 3066.32]  But not here,
[3066.74 --> 3067.36]  not here in
[3067.36 --> 3067.90]  Psalm 44.
[3068.78 --> 3069.56]  This is where
[3069.56 --> 3070.56]  God's people are
[3070.56 --> 3072.22]  suffering unjustly
[3072.22 --> 3072.96]  at the hands of
[3072.96 --> 3073.56]  their enemies.
[3073.56 --> 3073.62]  Christians.
[3075.02 --> 3075.80]  They're being
[3075.80 --> 3076.84]  slaughtered as
[3076.84 --> 3077.18]  sheep.
[3077.98 --> 3078.90]  They're suffering
[3078.90 --> 3079.62]  for God's
[3079.62 --> 3079.88]  sake.
[3081.70 --> 3081.90]  You know,
[3081.98 --> 3082.78]  and for us,
[3082.86 --> 3083.10]  you know,
[3083.78 --> 3085.24]  for most of
[3085.24 --> 3085.66]  us we have
[3085.66 --> 3086.10]  not faced
[3086.10 --> 3086.98]  physical danger
[3086.98 --> 3087.50]  for being a
[3087.50 --> 3087.80]  Christian,
[3088.28 --> 3088.94]  although I know
[3088.94 --> 3089.42]  that some of
[3089.42 --> 3089.88]  us in our
[3089.88 --> 3090.72]  congregation have.
[3091.94 --> 3092.78]  But for all
[3092.78 --> 3093.26]  of us,
[3093.30 --> 3093.50]  you know,
[3093.60 --> 3093.94]  if we're
[3093.94 --> 3095.46]  following Christ
[3095.46 --> 3096.10]  in the world,
[3096.30 --> 3097.10]  we will face
[3097.10 --> 3098.02]  opposition and
[3098.02 --> 3098.52]  ridicule
[3098.52 --> 3100.40]  sometimes for
[3100.40 --> 3101.64]  following Christ.
[3101.64 --> 3102.08]  right?
[3102.14 --> 3102.56]  The world
[3102.56 --> 3103.30]  thinks we
[3103.30 --> 3103.78]  are nuts.
[3105.70 --> 3106.40]  But Paul
[3106.40 --> 3106.90]  says,
[3107.60 --> 3108.26]  will this
[3108.26 --> 3108.72]  keep you
[3108.72 --> 3109.02]  from the
[3109.02 --> 3109.32]  love of
[3109.32 --> 3109.62]  God?
[3110.52 --> 3111.58]  Verse 37,
[3112.62 --> 3113.08]  no.
[3113.96 --> 3114.90]  In all of
[3114.90 --> 3115.52]  these things,
[3115.66 --> 3117.02]  we are more
[3117.02 --> 3117.86]  than conquerors
[3117.86 --> 3118.80]  through him
[3118.80 --> 3119.34]  who loved
[3119.34 --> 3119.66]  us.
[3120.32 --> 3120.88]  And then in
[3120.88 --> 3121.56]  the very last
[3121.56 --> 3121.96]  verses,
[3122.20 --> 3122.64]  the last two
[3122.64 --> 3122.92]  verses,
[3123.08 --> 3123.52]  Paul brings
[3123.52 --> 3124.68]  forth another
[3124.68 --> 3126.76]  list of all
[3126.76 --> 3127.82]  of the powers
[3127.82 --> 3129.42]  that we fear
[3129.42 --> 3129.96]  the most.
[3130.60 --> 3131.12]  And that we
[3131.12 --> 3131.70]  think maybe
[3131.70 --> 3132.36]  this is
[3132.36 --> 3133.14]  actually strong
[3133.14 --> 3133.78]  enough to
[3133.78 --> 3134.30]  separate us
[3134.30 --> 3134.52]  from the
[3134.52 --> 3134.80]  love of
[3134.80 --> 3135.04]  God.
[3135.26 --> 3135.60]  So let's
[3135.60 --> 3135.86]  just have
[3135.86 --> 3136.24]  a look.
[3136.78 --> 3137.58]  Verse 38
[3137.58 --> 3138.14]  and 39.
[3139.02 --> 3139.48]  For I am
[3139.48 --> 3140.70]  convinced that
[3140.70 --> 3142.34]  neither death
[3142.34 --> 3143.58]  nor life,
[3144.20 --> 3144.88]  neither angels
[3144.88 --> 3145.52]  nor demons,
[3145.94 --> 3146.36]  neither the
[3146.36 --> 3147.04]  present nor the
[3147.04 --> 3147.42]  future,
[3147.74 --> 3148.14]  nor any
[3148.14 --> 3148.74]  powers,
[3149.08 --> 3149.70]  neither height
[3149.70 --> 3150.50]  nor depth,
[3150.60 --> 3151.26]  nor anything
[3151.26 --> 3152.04]  else in all
[3152.04 --> 3152.60]  of creation,
[3152.98 --> 3153.86]  will be able
[3153.86 --> 3154.88]  to separate us
[3154.88 --> 3155.40]  from the love
[3155.40 --> 3155.98]  of God that
[3155.98 --> 3156.96]  is in Christ
[3156.96 --> 3157.66]  Jesus our
[3157.66 --> 3158.08]  Lord.
[3159.32 --> 3159.50]  Right?
[3159.56 --> 3159.92]  Basically,
[3159.92 --> 3160.74]  Paul is saying
[3160.74 --> 3161.56]  you cannot
[3161.56 --> 3162.86]  imagine a
[3162.86 --> 3163.72]  single thing.
[3164.10 --> 3164.66]  He's kind of
[3164.66 --> 3165.20]  covered it all
[3165.20 --> 3165.36]  here.
[3165.42 --> 3166.04]  This list is
[3166.04 --> 3166.54]  comprehensive.
[3167.14 --> 3167.66]  You cannot
[3167.66 --> 3168.44]  imagine a
[3168.44 --> 3169.26]  single thing
[3169.26 --> 3170.34]  that can stop
[3170.34 --> 3170.86]  God from
[3170.86 --> 3171.38]  loving you.
[3172.18 --> 3173.50]  If you die,
[3174.50 --> 3175.90]  God still
[3175.90 --> 3176.52]  loves you.
[3177.32 --> 3178.50]  If you live
[3178.50 --> 3179.22]  in this life,
[3179.28 --> 3179.42]  you know,
[3179.46 --> 3179.90]  some people,
[3180.08 --> 3180.66]  we don't fear
[3180.66 --> 3180.98]  death,
[3181.06 --> 3182.26]  we fear life.
[3183.26 --> 3183.74]  Right?
[3183.80 --> 3184.44]  Life is hard.
[3184.44 --> 3185.60]  But Paul says
[3185.60 --> 3186.48]  in life,
[3187.40 --> 3188.08]  in the midst
[3188.08 --> 3188.84]  of the challenges
[3188.84 --> 3189.34]  of life,
[3189.60 --> 3190.50]  God will still
[3190.50 --> 3190.94]  love you.
[3192.22 --> 3192.86]  If you are
[3192.86 --> 3193.60]  being hounded
[3193.60 --> 3194.70]  by spiritual
[3194.70 --> 3195.34]  beings and
[3195.34 --> 3195.94]  dark forces
[3195.94 --> 3196.66]  of the world,
[3197.50 --> 3198.08]  when we lived
[3198.08 --> 3198.54]  in Taiwan,
[3198.74 --> 3199.28]  we actually
[3199.28 --> 3199.82]  talked to
[3199.82 --> 3200.36]  people who
[3200.36 --> 3201.06]  are afraid
[3201.06 --> 3201.62]  of ghosts,
[3202.44 --> 3202.88]  who are
[3202.88 --> 3203.58]  afraid of
[3203.58 --> 3204.16]  spiritual
[3204.16 --> 3204.68]  beings.
[3205.22 --> 3205.80]  But Paul
[3205.80 --> 3206.22]  says,
[3206.78 --> 3207.44]  God will
[3207.44 --> 3207.94]  still love
[3207.94 --> 3208.16]  you.
[3209.32 --> 3209.92]  God will
[3209.92 --> 3210.24]  love you
[3210.24 --> 3210.76]  today.
[3211.76 --> 3212.38]  God will
[3212.38 --> 3212.82]  love you
[3212.82 --> 3213.42]  tomorrow.
[3213.42 --> 3215.24]  God will
[3215.24 --> 3216.22]  still love
[3216.22 --> 3216.50]  you if
[3216.50 --> 3216.94]  your spouse
[3216.94 --> 3217.40]  dies.
[3219.92 --> 3220.56]  God will
[3220.56 --> 3221.22]  still love
[3221.22 --> 3221.54]  you in
[3221.54 --> 3221.94]  the midst
[3221.94 --> 3222.96]  of your
[3222.96 --> 3223.46]  divorce.
[3224.90 --> 3225.40]  He will
[3225.40 --> 3226.04]  love you
[3226.04 --> 3227.28]  if your
[3227.28 --> 3227.86]  kids walk
[3227.86 --> 3228.14]  away.
[3229.82 --> 3230.46]  He will
[3230.46 --> 3230.84]  love you
[3230.84 --> 3231.10]  if you
[3231.10 --> 3231.44]  lose your
[3231.44 --> 3231.78]  job.
[3232.96 --> 3233.34]  He will
[3233.34 --> 3233.78]  love you
[3233.78 --> 3234.18]  when you
[3234.18 --> 3235.20]  feel unloved.
[3236.18 --> 3236.58]  He will
[3236.58 --> 3236.94]  love you
[3236.94 --> 3237.22]  when your
[3237.22 --> 3237.86]  own heart
[3237.86 --> 3238.40]  condemns
[3238.40 --> 3238.54]  you.
[3239.32 --> 3239.76]  He will
[3239.76 --> 3240.14]  love you
[3240.14 --> 3240.42]  in your
[3240.42 --> 3240.84]  depression.
[3241.92 --> 3242.36]  He will
[3242.36 --> 3242.76]  love you
[3242.76 --> 3243.10]  in your
[3243.10 --> 3243.76]  miscarriages
[3243.76 --> 3245.28]  and in
[3245.28 --> 3245.46]  your
[3245.46 --> 3245.88]  failures
[3245.88 --> 3246.16]  to
[3246.16 --> 3246.74]  conceive.
[3247.92 --> 3248.44]  He will
[3248.44 --> 3248.98]  love you
[3248.98 --> 3249.50]  in your
[3249.50 --> 3249.92]  singleness
[3249.92 --> 3250.92]  and in
[3250.92 --> 3251.06]  your
[3251.06 --> 3251.48]  marriage.
[3252.38 --> 3252.82]  He will
[3252.82 --> 3253.18]  love you
[3253.18 --> 3253.52]  in your
[3253.52 --> 3253.98]  loneliness.
[3254.68 --> 3255.06]  He will
[3255.06 --> 3255.54]  love you
[3255.54 --> 3256.26]  in your
[3256.26 --> 3256.58]  broken
[3256.58 --> 3257.14]  dreams.
[3258.74 --> 3259.34]  Paul is
[3259.34 --> 3259.48]  saying,
[3259.62 --> 3259.82]  I am
[3259.82 --> 3260.38]  sure of
[3260.38 --> 3260.56]  it.
[3261.44 --> 3261.94]  I am
[3261.94 --> 3262.24]  sure.
[3262.34 --> 3262.70]  You cannot
[3262.70 --> 3263.26]  imagine a
[3263.26 --> 3263.96]  single thing
[3263.96 --> 3264.46]  that can
[3264.46 --> 3264.90]  stop
[3264.90 --> 3265.52]  God's
[3265.52 --> 3265.84]  love.
[3266.74 --> 3266.86]  And
[3266.86 --> 3267.12]  friends,
[3267.26 --> 3267.80]  that is
[3267.80 --> 3268.44]  our hope.
[3269.10 --> 3269.56]  That is
[3269.56 --> 3269.98]  our hope.
[3270.30 --> 3270.44]  Right?
[3270.44 --> 3271.20]  The reason
[3271.20 --> 3271.60]  that we
[3271.60 --> 3271.88]  can be
[3271.88 --> 3272.28]  more than
[3272.28 --> 3272.96]  conquerors,
[3273.26 --> 3273.72]  the reason
[3273.72 --> 3273.98]  that we
[3273.98 --> 3274.28]  can be
[3274.28 --> 3274.74]  super
[3274.74 --> 3275.36]  conquerors,
[3275.42 --> 3275.70]  is not
[3275.70 --> 3276.56]  because of
[3276.56 --> 3277.14]  my love
[3277.14 --> 3277.60]  for him,
[3277.72 --> 3278.18]  but because
[3278.18 --> 3278.58]  of his
[3278.58 --> 3279.12]  love for
[3279.12 --> 3279.36]  me.
[3280.40 --> 3280.62]  Right?
[3280.66 --> 3280.86]  What's
[3280.86 --> 3281.06]  really
[3281.06 --> 3281.66]  important is
[3281.66 --> 3282.14]  not my
[3282.14 --> 3282.88]  faithfulness,
[3283.10 --> 3283.70]  but his
[3283.70 --> 3284.46]  faithfulness.
[3285.30 --> 3285.52]  Right?
[3285.56 --> 3285.82]  It's not
[3285.82 --> 3286.70]  my perseverance,
[3287.08 --> 3287.50]  but it's
[3287.50 --> 3287.78]  his
[3287.78 --> 3288.32]  perseverance.
[3289.56 --> 3290.18]  It's not
[3290.18 --> 3290.92]  my hold
[3290.92 --> 3291.42]  on him,
[3291.52 --> 3291.94]  but it is
[3291.94 --> 3293.04]  his hold
[3293.04 --> 3294.20]  on me.
[3295.42 --> 3295.84]  And Paul
[3295.84 --> 3296.46]  tells us
[3296.46 --> 3296.70]  this,
[3296.74 --> 3297.16]  so that we
[3297.16 --> 3297.78]  would have
[3297.78 --> 3299.20]  the joy
[3299.20 --> 3299.86]  of God,
[3300.44 --> 3300.96]  that we
[3300.96 --> 3301.76]  could rejoice
[3301.76 --> 3302.32]  in the
[3302.32 --> 3302.82]  assurance
[3302.82 --> 3304.36]  of God's
[3304.36 --> 3304.92]  love for
[3304.92 --> 3305.36]  us,
[3306.00 --> 3306.58]  and that
[3306.58 --> 3306.92]  will see
[3306.92 --> 3307.24]  us through
[3307.24 --> 3307.78]  everything
[3307.78 --> 3308.84]  that we
[3308.84 --> 3309.24]  face in
[3309.24 --> 3309.70]  this life.
[3310.86 --> 3311.12]  Friends,
[3311.18 --> 3311.58]  that is the
[3311.58 --> 3312.30]  invitation to
[3312.30 --> 3313.04]  the unstoppable
[3313.04 --> 3313.52]  love of
[3313.52 --> 3313.74]  God.
[3314.72 --> 3315.40]  So let's
[3315.40 --> 3315.60]  pray.
[3320.32 --> 3320.80]  Heavenly
[3320.80 --> 3321.14]  Father,
[3321.32 --> 3322.86]  we praise
[3322.86 --> 3323.32]  you.
[3323.32 --> 3325.88]  Lord,
[3325.92 --> 3326.14]  we are
[3326.14 --> 3326.84]  grateful for
[3326.84 --> 3327.34]  your love,
[3328.02 --> 3328.44]  which is
[3328.44 --> 3328.84]  more than
[3328.84 --> 3329.14]  we can
[3329.14 --> 3329.44]  even
[3329.44 --> 3330.02]  imagine.
[3330.88 --> 3331.10]  Lord,
[3331.26 --> 3331.94]  unstoppable,
[3332.34 --> 3333.02]  unshakable,
[3333.54 --> 3334.28]  persevering
[3334.28 --> 3334.74]  through the
[3334.74 --> 3336.26]  worst powers,
[3336.68 --> 3337.56]  disasters that
[3337.56 --> 3338.04]  could possibly
[3338.04 --> 3338.58]  come to our
[3338.58 --> 3338.88]  minds.
[3340.34 --> 3340.76]  Lord,
[3340.84 --> 3341.52]  remind us of
[3341.52 --> 3341.82]  your love
[3341.82 --> 3342.34]  this morning.
[3342.66 --> 3343.10]  Would we
[3343.10 --> 3344.56]  taste and
[3344.56 --> 3345.78]  see that
[3345.78 --> 3346.44]  you are good
[3346.44 --> 3346.76]  and that
[3346.76 --> 3347.10]  you love
[3347.10 --> 3347.42]  us?
[3348.24 --> 3348.74]  Convince
[3348.74 --> 3349.62]  us of
[3349.62 --> 3350.08]  your love
[3350.08 --> 3350.50]  in our
[3350.50 --> 3351.38]  hearts and
[3351.38 --> 3351.72]  in our
[3351.72 --> 3352.28]  minds as
[3352.28 --> 3353.02]  we look to
[3353.02 --> 3353.42]  Jesus,
[3353.96 --> 3354.34]  the one
[3354.34 --> 3354.82]  who died
[3354.82 --> 3355.28]  for us,
[3355.38 --> 3356.00]  who rose
[3356.00 --> 3356.58]  for us,
[3356.96 --> 3357.54]  and who
[3357.54 --> 3358.04]  even now
[3358.04 --> 3358.74]  is interceding
[3358.74 --> 3359.24]  for us.
[3360.38 --> 3360.68]  Lord,
[3360.76 --> 3361.14]  it is in
[3361.14 --> 3361.58]  your name
[3361.58 --> 3361.96]  we pray
[3361.96 --> 3362.36]  and ask
[3362.36 --> 3362.66]  for your
[3362.66 --> 3363.00]  glory.
[3363.56 --> 3363.92]  Amen.
[3366.42 --> 3367.08]  All right,
[3367.16 --> 3367.98]  let's stand
[3367.98 --> 3368.66]  and let's
[3368.66 --> 3371.18]  sing kind
[3371.18 --> 3371.34]  of an
[3371.34 --> 3372.04]  upbeat song.
[3373.46 --> 3374.30]  God is
[3374.30 --> 3374.84]  for us.
[3383.02 --> 3390.70]  sing again.
[3390.70 --> 3391.00]  Amen.
[3391.00 --> 3392.12]  We won't
[3392.12 --> 3392.68]  fear the
[3392.68 --> 3393.42]  battle,
[3393.96 --> 3394.52]  we won't
[3394.52 --> 3395.18]  fear the
[3395.18 --> 3395.92]  night,
[3396.12 --> 3396.90]  we will
[3396.90 --> 3397.60]  walk the
[3397.60 --> 3398.40]  valley,
[3398.82 --> 3399.24]  will you
[3399.24 --> 3399.96]  by our
[3399.96 --> 3400.66]  side.
[3401.08 --> 3401.30]  You
[3401.30 --> 3401.96]  won't go
[3401.96 --> 3402.50]  before
[3402.50 --> 3403.36]  us,
[3403.42 --> 3403.62]  you
[3403.62 --> 3404.28]  will lead
[3404.28 --> 3404.54]  the
[3404.54 --> 3405.14]  way,
[3405.58 --> 3406.22]  we have
[3406.22 --> 3406.84]  found a
[3406.84 --> 3407.74]  refuge,
[3407.96 --> 3408.84]  only you
[3408.84 --> 3420.40]  can sing. Sing with joy now, our God is for us. If Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress,
[3420.40 --> 3430.36]  raise your voice now, no love is greater. Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3430.36 --> 3447.50]  Even when I stumble, even when I fall, even when I turn back, still your love is sure.
[3447.50 --> 3457.60]  You will not abandon, you will not forsake, you will cheer me onward, never-ending grace.
[3457.60 --> 3467.46]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us. If Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress,
[3467.46 --> 3477.46]  raise your voice now, no love is greater. Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3477.46 --> 3502.46]  Neither light nor death did separate us, hell and death would not defeat us. Who who gave his Son to free us, holds me in his life.
[3502.46 --> 3532.44]  Sing with joy now, our God is for us. If Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress,
[3532.44 --> 3543.44]  raise your voice now, no love is greater. Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[3543.44 --> 3570.88]  So this is the time in our service when we get to respond to God's great, rich mercy for us.
[3570.88 --> 3573.78]  And we do so with our giving our tithes and our offerings.
[3574.34 --> 3579.86]  Our designated offering this morning is for a missionary family that we support, the Umarads,
[3580.36 --> 3583.98]  as they serve God with Resonate Global Mission, our CRC mission agency.
[3584.92 --> 3589.64]  And so may I ask our deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering.
[3589.64 --> 3594.92]  The liver is called andedo, theva, and the
[3594.92 --> 3595.72]  evening patron's quienes we support.
[3595.72 --> 3596.30]  Thanks for your 밥s if you do so.
[3596.30 --> 3600.48]  Our sagen pareil.
[3600.48 --> 3601.56]  The Lord is the same as we know as we are.
[3601.56 --> 3605.52]  Can you hear?
[3605.52 --> 3619.60]  The human guidance, the appeal of theitos sh
[3619.64 --> 3621.64]  Amen.
[3649.64 --> 3651.64]  Amen.
[3679.64 --> 3681.64]  Amen.
[3709.64 --> 3710.64]  Amen.
[3710.64 --> 3711.64]  Amen.
[3711.64 --> 3712.64]  Amen.
[3718.64 --> 3726.64]  Alright, let's pray together and bring all of our needs and our requests before the God of heaven and earth, before our Heavenly Father.
[3726.64 --> 3730.64]  And at the conclusion of our prayer, we will say the Lord's Prayer together.
[3730.64 --> 3731.64]  Okay, let's pray.
[3731.64 --> 3738.64]  Our Heavenly Father, how magnificent is your name throughout all the earth.
[3738.64 --> 3741.64]  Lord, you have covered the heavens with your majesty.
[3741.64 --> 3748.64]  The mountains and the skies, they point to your holiness and your greatness, O Lord.
[3748.64 --> 3755.64]  All that is good points to you, the Creator, and in you is complete wholeness and peace.
[3755.64 --> 3758.64]  To you belong wisdom and might.
[3758.64 --> 3761.64]  Lord, you change the times and seasons.
[3761.64 --> 3765.64]  You reveal deep and hidden things for the sake of your people.
[3765.64 --> 3795.64] 
[3795.64 --> 3798.64]  Give us hearts that wait lovingly.
[3798.64 --> 3801.64]  Give us hearts that wait hopefully.
[3801.64 --> 3812.64]  And hearts that wait faithfully for the day that you prepared from all eternity when you would return and remove the veil and make heaven and earth one.
[3812.64 --> 3817.64]  How we wait, O Lord, would you rule and reign over this world that belongs to you.
[3817.64 --> 3822.64]  Your word tells us that the King's heart is in the hands of the Lord.
[3822.64 --> 3826.64]  Like the rivers of water, he turns it wherever he wishes.
[3826.64 --> 3839.64]  And so we pray that all those who are, Lord, in places of political power, whether in our national or provincial or local government, Lord, we pray that you would give to them justice.
[3839.64 --> 3844.64]  And that your justice might roll down through those who serve.
[3844.64 --> 3851.64]  And that they would do so, Lord, serving with graciousness, compassion, and mercy.
[3851.64 --> 3858.64]  Father, not only do we pray for our political leaders as you ask, but we pray also for our church.
[3858.64 --> 3864.64]  May we be a church that exchanges the spreading of sin for the spreading of your kingdom.
[3864.64 --> 3871.64]  And may we receive your grace daily and your mercy that is more than any in all of our sins.
[3871.64 --> 3874.64]  Father, make us emissaries of your truth.
[3874.64 --> 3877.64]  And give us hearts that seek the lost.
[3877.64 --> 3880.64]  Father, we pray for the Umarans this morning.
[3880.64 --> 3888.64]  Lord, let the light of Christ shine through them into the place and the context where you have called them to serve you.
[3888.64 --> 3892.64]  Lord, let your gospel truth bring freedom to all who hear.
[3892.64 --> 3898.64]  And we pray that you grant them protection and that you would bless their ministry with fruitfulness.
[3898.64 --> 3902.64]  Father, we also pray for some of the needs in our own congregation.
[3902.64 --> 3905.64]  Lord, we continue to lift up to you Mel and Shirley.
[3905.64 --> 3912.64]  We thank you that they are both had a good week and are on the road to feeling better.
[3912.64 --> 3920.64]  Lord, we continue to pray for Sean who is struggling with Lyme disease.
[3920.64 --> 3927.64]  And Lord, would you just surround him with your healing grace and your hand upon him.
[3927.64 --> 3931.64]  Lord, we thank you that John Smith is doing better.
[3931.64 --> 3938.64]  And Lord, we ask that you would protect him from any further or worse stroke.
[3938.64 --> 3940.64]  Father, we pray for other needs as well.
[3940.64 --> 3946.64]  Lord, we pray for Jenny and Con and her mom.
[3946.64 --> 3950.64]  And Lord, for her continual recovery.
[3950.64 --> 3952.64]  And Lord, there are other needs.
[3952.64 --> 3956.64]  Some of them have been spoken and some are still unspoken.
[3956.64 --> 3959.64]  Some of them, Lord, are known to some of us.
[3959.64 --> 3962.64]  And the Lord, all of them are known to you.
[3962.64 --> 3966.64]  And so, Lord, whatever need that you have placed in our hearts this morning,
[3966.64 --> 3970.64]  we lift up those in our own hearts to you this morning.
[3974.64 --> 3978.64]  Father, we thank you that because of Christ you hear us.
[3978.64 --> 3985.64]  And so, we pray now in the words that Jesus taught us to pray during his earthly ministry, saying together,
[3985.64 --> 3989.64]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[3989.64 --> 3994.64]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[3994.64 --> 3997.64]  Give us this day our daily bread.
[3997.64 --> 4001.64]  And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[4001.64 --> 4006.64]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4006.64 --> 4011.64]  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[4011.64 --> 4013.64]  Amen.
[4013.64 --> 4014.64]  Let's stand.
[4014.64 --> 4019.64]  And as God has the first word in our worship service,
[4019.64 --> 4025.64]  in the call to worship, he also sends us out with his good words,
[4025.64 --> 4027.64]  the benediction upon us.
[4027.64 --> 4031.64]  So, I invite you to hold out your hands and receive this benediction.
[4031.64 --> 4034.64]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
[4034.64 --> 4036.64]  neither angels nor demons,
[4036.64 --> 4039.64]  neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[4039.64 --> 4041.64]  neither height nor depth,
[4041.64 --> 4043.64]  nor anything else in all creation,
[4043.64 --> 4047.64]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4047.64 --> 4048.64]  Amen.
[4048.64 --> 4049.64]  Amen.
[4049.64 --> 4050.64]  Amen.
[4050.64 --> 4051.64]  Amen.
[4052.64 --> 4053.64]  Amen.
[4053.64 --> 4054.64]  Amen.
[4054.64 --> 4073.80]  Lord of Lords, King of Kings, You alone are worthy.
[4073.80 --> 4084.24]  All the earth and heaven sing praises to Your name.
[4084.64 --> 4095.26]  Lamb of God, Holy One, Righteous and forgiving.
[4096.62 --> 4105.74]  Morning star, rising sun, There is none like You.
[4105.74 --> 4117.18]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, Praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4117.18 --> 4128.16]  Praise the King of glory, Praise Him for eternity.
[4128.16 --> 4139.38]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, Praise the Spirit, everyone.
[4139.38 --> 4150.54]  Praise the King of glory, Praise Him for eternity.
[4150.54 --> 4152.54]  Amen.
[4152.54 --> 4153.54]  Amen.
[4182.54 --> 4183.54]  Amen.
[4212.54 --> 4213.54]  Amen.
