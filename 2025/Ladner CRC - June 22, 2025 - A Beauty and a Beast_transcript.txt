[330.64 --> 331.18]  Good morning.
[332.18 --> 336.16]  Welcome to Ladder Christian Reform Church on this Lord's Day.
[336.88 --> 340.20]  My name is Jason Trumull, and I'm a pastor here from Ladder CRC.
[341.20 --> 346.90]  And you can hear that.
[347.06 --> 347.58]  How does it just mean?
[348.32 --> 348.64]  Okay.
[352.64 --> 355.94]  It's my pleasure to worship you who worship this morning.
[355.94 --> 359.90]  And especially if you're visiting with us, it's a pleasure to have you.
[359.98 --> 361.00]  We're so glad that you're here.
[361.90 --> 366.90]  And today we have the pleasure of having Gary Rosemont with us,
[366.96 --> 373.42]  and he'll be giving a sermon on the Lord from 1 Samuel, chapter 35 today.
[374.28 --> 379.08]  And also maybe we'll be able to hear an update on Gary's ministry to see parents.
[379.76 --> 384.46]  So also yesterday was National Indigenous Peoples Day.
[385.94 --> 387.62]  I know you're having the power of his ministry, and this board.
[387.94 --> 388.84]  And you may get a response.
[388.86 --> 389.56]  And you may go on, Ghost.
[389.80 --> 390.26]  All right.
[392.38 --> 393.28]  And for us, please understand what it means,
[393.28 --> 394.80]  we're doing a recognition for you.
[395.38 --> 396.08]  And you may be.
[396.32 --> 397.80]  Each study is taking a break.
[397.88 --> 398.88]  We're just talking about getting a break.
[399.32 --> 400.00]  When you need to take a break.
[401.66 --> 402.38]  Open up this day.
[402.62 --> 404.34]  How does it mean you'll be taking a break?
[404.38 --> 406.28]  And without the responsibility of how is you,
[406.68 --> 408.14]  going to give a break,
[408.50 --> 410.04]  they're going to pray for you.
[412.16 --> 412.74]  Good morning.
[412.74 --> 442.72]  Thank you.
[442.74 --> 451.36]  As I've mentioned before, we'll have a guest teacher, Hedda Huang, who is a student at Richmond Christian School, but we still need some helpers.
[452.06 --> 463.32]  And so if there's a sign-up sheet on the foyer table, if you are willing and available to help out at one Sunday during the summer, that would be really fantastic.
[464.24 --> 467.12]  As well, our summer camp is coming right up.
[467.78 --> 470.20]  And so that is July 7 to 11.
[470.20 --> 474.62]  There still might be some opportunities for volunteers and for registration.
[475.84 --> 485.06]  And then lastly, I'll note that tomorrow at 2 o'clock, Monday, we will have the Celebration of Life Memorial Service for Ted Vanderhorst.
[485.42 --> 492.44]  And so everyone is welcome and invited to attend his service tomorrow at 2 o'clock.
[492.44 --> 505.20]  Now, one of the reasons that we meet together each Sunday is because we are forgetful people.
[506.16 --> 508.08]  You know, we forget things all the time.
[508.30 --> 513.12]  But one of the things in the spiritual life that we forget is we forget who God is.
[513.12 --> 516.28]  We forget who we are.
[516.98 --> 519.64]  And we forget our desperate need for God's grace.
[520.72 --> 527.96]  And so we gather again to worship this morning, to hear God speak to us from his word, to fellowship with one another,
[527.96 --> 532.16]  to remember what we might otherwise forget.
[532.16 --> 541.78]  And so people of God, be reminded that the creator of the heavens and the earth, our God and our Father, has called us to worship him this morning.
[542.16 --> 546.34]  And our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 108, verses 1 through 4.
[546.78 --> 548.38]  And we'll say this responsibly.
[548.38 --> 553.66]  Our hearts are ready, O Lord, our hearts are ready.
[554.54 --> 556.54]  We will sing and make melody.
[557.14 --> 559.06]  We will awaken the dawn.
[559.98 --> 563.00]  We will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[563.30 --> 565.84]  We will sing praises to you among the nations.
[566.76 --> 570.34]  For your steadfast love is great above the heavens.
[571.06 --> 574.32]  And your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
[575.20 --> 577.68]  Now, would you please join with me in a prayer of adoration.
[577.68 --> 578.58]  Let's pray together.
[581.46 --> 588.52]  Father, Son, Holy Spirit, we come into your presence this morning, O Lord, because you have invited us.
[589.22 --> 594.72]  And we come to you as your children, for you have made the way possible for us.
[596.08 --> 598.94]  We acknowledge, O Lord, that we are forgetful people.
[600.04 --> 603.16]  Remind us this morning, Lord, of who you are.
[603.16 --> 610.62]  Lord, remind us of our need for you, our need for your mercy and grace in each of our lives.
[611.76 --> 618.68]  Remind us, Lord, that you are our maker, our redeemer, our sustainer, and our future hope.
[618.68 --> 625.48]  And lead us in our worship this morning, Lord, so that all that we say and all that we do may be for your honor and glory.
[625.92 --> 629.66]  May you be our sole focus this morning.
[630.22 --> 632.86]  And our words, our prayers, and our hearts.
[633.86 --> 638.70]  Lord, now would you stir our hearts to worship you, the one true and living God.
[638.80 --> 640.20]  And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[640.76 --> 642.80]  And all God's people said, Amen.
[642.80 --> 647.60]  So, friends, would you stand in body or in spirit as you are able?
[648.36 --> 653.22]  God greets us this morning with these words from the letter of Galatians.
[653.66 --> 658.16]  Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[658.62 --> 663.24]  who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age,
[663.80 --> 669.58]  according to the will of God, our God and Father, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[670.10 --> 670.52]  Amen.
[670.52 --> 676.14]  And as the Lord has called us and has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[676.14 --> 676.42]  Amen.
[700.52 --> 706.70]  Amen.
[706.70 --> 707.70]  Amen.
[707.98 --> 709.30]  Amen.
[709.30 --> 709.62]  Amen.

[712.90 --> 713.42]  Amen.
[713.74 --> 714.00]  Amen.
[714.14 --> 714.80]  Amen.
[714.80 --> 715.34]  Amen.
[715.76 --> 717.60]  Amen.
[717.60 --> 718.42]  Amen.
[718.42 --> 718.94]  Amen.
[718.98 --> 719.26]  Amen.
[719.26 --> 720.18]  Amen.
[720.18 --> 720.50]  Amen.
[720.50 --> 721.14]  Amen.
[721.14 --> 721.16]  Amen.
[721.22 --> 721.46]  Amen.
[721.46 --> 722.94]  Amen.
[722.94 --> 723.24]  Amen.
[723.24 --> 742.86]  The splendor of the King
[742.86 --> 746.70]  Clothed in majesty
[746.70 --> 750.28]  Let all the earth rejoice
[750.28 --> 753.86]  Let all the earth rejoice
[753.86 --> 758.90]  He loves himself in light
[758.90 --> 763.62]  And darkness tries to hide
[763.62 --> 766.50]  And trembles at his voice
[766.50 --> 769.94]  And trembles at his voice
[769.94 --> 774.58]  All great is our God
[774.58 --> 779.58]  Sing with me, all great is our God
[779.58 --> 783.16]  And always see how great
[783.16 --> 788.74]  How great is our God
[788.74 --> 795.98]  And days to which he stands
[795.98 --> 800.74]  Time is in his hands
[800.74 --> 802.78]  Beginning at the end
[802.78 --> 806.74]  Beginning at the end
[806.74 --> 812.32]  Oh God, I'm three in one
[812.32 --> 819.46]  Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the Lamb
[819.46 --> 822.32]  The Lion and the Lamb
[822.32 --> 827.32]  How great is our God
[827.32 --> 832.74]  Sing with me, how great is our God
[832.74 --> 836.32]  And always see how great
[836.32 --> 842.32]  How great is our God
[842.32 --> 849.32]  Name above all name

[854.32 --> 856.90]  My heart will sing
[856.90 --> 859.90]  My heart will sing
[859.90 --> 863.90]  How great is our God
[863.90 --> 865.90]  My heart will sing
[865.90 --> 866.90]  How great is our God
[866.90 --> 869.90]  Live above all name
[869.90 --> 875.00]  Worthy of all praise
[875.00 --> 877.58]  My heart will sing
[877.58 --> 878.58]  My heart will sing
[878.58 --> 886.58]  How great is our God
[886.58 --> 890.74]  How great is our God
[890.74 --> 895.86]  Sing with me how great is our God
[895.86 --> 899.48]  And always see how great
[899.48 --> 904.96]  How great is our God
[916.58 --> 937.46]  O worship the King
[937.46 --> 940.84]  All glory is above
[940.84 --> 944.44]  For grateful is in
[944.44 --> 947.96]  His power and love
[947.96 --> 951.38]  Our shield and defender
[951.38 --> 955.10]  These gentle days
[955.10 --> 958.46]  A villain has been
[958.46 --> 963.56]  And with it we praise
[963.56 --> 967.46]  O tell of His love
[967.46 --> 971.06]  And sing of His grace
[971.06 --> 974.42]  Whose love is the Lord
[974.42 --> 976.58]  Whose love is the Lord
[976.58 --> 977.58]  Whose love is the Lord
[977.58 --> 981.72]  His child loves our heaven
[981.72 --> 984.78]  And the Lord will not come
[984.78 --> 988.46]  And our kids is love
[988.46 --> 990.98]  And the Lord will not come
[990.98 --> 992.98]  And the Lord will not come
[992.98 --> 997.92]  Your beautiful care
[997.92 --> 1001.46]  What a dark can recite
[1001.46 --> 1005.06]  His breath is in air
[1005.06 --> 1007.98]  It shines in the light
[1007.98 --> 1011.50]  He's still from the hills
[1011.50 --> 1015.50]  He's sent to the plain
[1015.50 --> 1017.76]  And sweetly
[1017.76 --> 1023.50]  He's still in the dew and the rain
[1023.50 --> 1028.60]  Fred children of God
[1028.60 --> 1031.42]  And feeble as well
[1031.42 --> 1034.94]  In you do we trust
[1034.94 --> 1038.94]  No fight we do fail
[1038.94 --> 1042.68]  Your mercy is all tender
[1042.68 --> 1046.14]  How fun to the end
[1046.14 --> 1053.96]  Our maker, defender, redeemer and friend
[1053.96 --> 1056.04]  O Jesus Christ
[1056.04 --> 1057.14]  Your То naturally
[1057.14 --> 1058.48]  Your majesty is Implementation
[1058.48 --> 1060.86]  A Archangel
[1060.86 --> 1060.88]  In your grace
[1060.88 --> 1074.88]  them
[1088.24 --> 1088.88]  you may be seated
[1090.88 --> 1098.56]  so we just
[1098.56 --> 1105.42]  in song and in prayer reflected on who god is that he is our great redeemer and our friend
[1105.42 --> 1113.60]  and as we reflect on god's character naturally that leads us to consider our own character who
[1113.60 --> 1119.68]  we are in the ways that we in our sin fall short of the glory and the holiness
[1119.68 --> 1127.48]  of god and all that god desires of us and the way we live in the world and so we come now to a time
[1127.48 --> 1135.02]  of confession which is an opportunity to be honest with god about who we are and as we sang to trust
[1135.02 --> 1144.74]  in him we are weak feeble and frail and so we trust in the one who is strong and who promises to be our
[1144.74 --> 1151.04]  god and so we turn away from our sin in this time of confession and so i will lead us in a prayer of
[1151.04 --> 1156.88]  confession then i'll give you a moment afterwards to silently bring your own sins before the lord
[1156.88 --> 1164.66]  in confession and today because it is indigenous peoples sunday i will be using a well-known prayer
[1164.66 --> 1169.86]  by chief yellow lark of the lakota people so please join me in a prayer confession
[1169.86 --> 1175.06]  o great spirit
[1175.06 --> 1187.00]  whose breath gives life to the world and whose voice is heard in the soft breeze we need your strength
[1187.00 --> 1196.26]  and wisdom cause us to walk in beauty give us eyes ever to behold the red and purple sunset
[1196.26 --> 1204.46]  make us wise so that we may understand what you have taught us help us learn the lessons you have
[1204.46 --> 1212.86]  hidden in every leaf and rock make us always ready to come to you with clean hands and steady eyes
[1212.86 --> 1221.82]  so when life fades like the fading sunset our spirits may come to you without shame amen
[1221.82 --> 1229.48]  trusting in god's mercy and love let's take time now to silently confess our sins to god so that we may
[1229.48 --> 1233.30]  also come to him with clean hands having received his forgiveness
[1233.30 --> 1233.60]  so
[1233.60 --> 1263.42]  oh god who gives life have mercy upon us oh lord for the sake of your son our lord jesus christ who died for us
[1263.42 --> 1269.48]  who rose victorious who ascended to the right hand of the father who poured out his spirit
[1269.48 --> 1277.76]  to be with us to transform our hearts and to help us to walk in the ways of our lord jesus lord would you
[1277.76 --> 1286.30]  help us and lord we thank you for the the joy the peace that we can experience because of what you have
[1286.30 --> 1295.22]  done for us in your gospel we pray in jesus name amen so now in response to our cries for mercy god is not
[1295.22 --> 1301.70]  silent but he responds he responds with arms wide open he responds with his amazing grace and his love
[1301.70 --> 1308.60]  so would you receive these words of assurance from first john chapter one and then there'll be a place
[1308.60 --> 1317.24]  for you to respond with with words from hebrews so if we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and
[1317.24 --> 1324.58]  the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins
[1324.58 --> 1334.30]  and purify us from all unrighteousness together through jesus therefore let us continually offer to god
[1334.30 --> 1340.14]  a sacrifice of praise and so let's do that together now let's stand and we'll sing two more songs
[1340.14 --> 1343.58]  together of praise for god's grace to us
[1343.58 --> 1352.86]  so

[1636.22 --> 1638.22]  to the
[1638.22 --> 1640.22]  pastures
[1640.22 --> 1642.22]  that are
[1642.22 --> 1644.22]  clean
[1644.22 --> 1646.22]  refreshing
[1646.22 --> 1648.22]  to
[1648.22 --> 1650.22]  us

[1651.50 --> 1652.22]  our
[1652.22 --> 1653.50]  us
[1653.50 --> 1655.50]  free

[1657.50 --> 1661.50]  on
[1661.50 --> 1663.50]  lead

[1675.50 --> 1677.50]  on
[1677.50 --> 1679.50]  lead
[1679.50 --> 1682.46]  in
[1709.50 --> 1720.20]  Lord, you are our shepherd.
[1720.20 --> 1724.10]  We will act for the good thing.
[1724.64 --> 1728.02]  For you take us to the past.
[1728.20 --> 1730.56]  Truth not our grief.
[1732.68 --> 1735.66]  We'll lead these paths to one another.
[1736.02 --> 1739.40]  Bring refreshing to us all.
[1739.50 --> 1746.24]  As you guide us in the paths that make us free.
[1747.50 --> 1750.32]  Need all.
[1754.20 --> 1756.80]  Need all.
[1762.80 --> 1766.28]  When we walk up alone.
[1766.28 --> 1770.02]  We will fear no evil thing.
[1770.02 --> 1776.16]  You bring comfort in the presence of our hope.
[1778.10 --> 1781.02]  You anoint our heads with oil.
[1781.02 --> 1784.76]  And with mercy on us down.
[1784.76 --> 1791.76]  As we dwell in the house forevermore.
[1791.76 --> 1812.52]  In the house.
[1812.52 --> 1837.00]  So at this time our children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1837.00 --> 1844.42]  And we will now welcome Gary to come up and share God's word with us.
[1844.80 --> 1845.54]  So welcome Gary.
[1854.78 --> 1856.00]  So good morning.
[1856.76 --> 1858.82]  It's good to be with you again.
[1859.56 --> 1863.04]  And always good to come back.
[1863.64 --> 1866.72]  And Jenny sends her greetings.
[1867.76 --> 1869.82]  She is online.
[1870.58 --> 1870.94]  Hi hun.
[1871.44 --> 1877.34]  She had a corrective toe surgery recently.
[1877.78 --> 1883.54]  So she's in an air cast and hobbling around and she would have made me late anyway.
[1884.26 --> 1888.34]  But she's recovering from a bunion surgery.
[1888.34 --> 1893.72]  So she sends her greetings to everyone but would love to have been here.
[1893.72 --> 1897.98]  And we're looking forward to seeing some of you.
[1898.10 --> 1904.76]  A few of you are coming to join us for our port tour cruise this coming Saturday night.
[1905.10 --> 1907.80]  We could still slot you in if you want to come.
[1908.00 --> 1909.38]  So let me know.
[1909.38 --> 1914.46]  But it should be a great cruise heading up the Burrard Inlet.
[1914.68 --> 1919.20]  So always a good chance to see the port from a different perspective.
[1919.68 --> 1921.66]  So looking forward to that very much.
[1921.66 --> 1924.54]  Now our sermon.
[1924.54 --> 1928.50]  The sermon today is from an extended text.
[1928.66 --> 1930.46]  And I'm not going to read the whole thing.
[1931.08 --> 1933.14]  So I'm going to be working through it in parts.
[1933.26 --> 1935.58]  So I'm not going to have an initial reading and you say.
[1935.90 --> 1937.56]  I say this is the word of the Lord.
[1937.64 --> 1939.34]  You say or whatever you say.
[1939.40 --> 1940.00]  Thanks be to God.
[1940.00 --> 1945.32]  But I'm going to read through it in parts as we work through the text.
[1945.44 --> 1945.56]  Okay.
[1945.66 --> 1947.50]  So and I don't have it on the overhead.
[1947.86 --> 1950.40]  So you're going to have to do it the old-fashioned way.
[1951.00 --> 1952.14]  Open your Bibles.
[1953.12 --> 1953.76]  Pew Bibles.
[1954.44 --> 1954.96]  I think it.
[1955.12 --> 1955.40]  Sorry.
[1955.50 --> 1955.80]  I forgot.
[1955.90 --> 1957.14]  It said the number page.
[1957.14 --> 1959.08]  1 Samuel 25.
[1959.58 --> 1959.78]  2.
[1962.38 --> 1963.26]  Something like that.
[1963.70 --> 1964.44]  2.17.
[1967.66 --> 1968.26]  2.17.
[1970.00 --> 1972.88]  Are we cutting in and out?
[1973.94 --> 1975.02]  We'll see how it goes.
[1975.06 --> 1975.38]  Okay.
[1975.58 --> 1976.86]  I may switch to this.
[1976.96 --> 1978.26]  But I like to move too much.
[1978.48 --> 1979.56]  So we'll see how it goes.
[1980.36 --> 1982.14]  2 Samuel 25.
[1982.58 --> 1984.64]  And you're just going to have to keep your Bibles open.
[1985.20 --> 1986.98]  Like I said, I'm going to be working through.
[1986.98 --> 1989.04]  We're going to go through various texts.
[1989.24 --> 1991.42]  We'll be kind of going back and forth a little bit.
[1992.40 --> 1994.66]  So, you know, get ready.
[1995.42 --> 1996.92]  We're going to work through this.
[1997.48 --> 1999.40]  Now, seafarers.
[2000.72 --> 2001.48]  This week.
[2001.54 --> 2002.82]  I know it's this.
[2003.76 --> 2007.14]  This weekend is the Indigenous Day.
[2007.82 --> 2012.08]  And so I didn't want to sort of take that over.
[2012.30 --> 2015.88]  But this also, this past Wednesday.
[2015.88 --> 2017.14]  Or this, sorry.
[2017.26 --> 2018.22]  This next Wednesday.
[2019.10 --> 2021.36]  The 25th of June.
[2021.56 --> 2023.76]  Is always, every year.
[2024.22 --> 2028.18]  The annual International Day of the Seafarer.
[2028.88 --> 2029.20]  Okay.
[2029.28 --> 2030.42]  And we do this every year.
[2030.48 --> 2031.06]  It's an IMO.
[2031.18 --> 2032.62]  International Maritime Organization.
[2032.62 --> 2033.76]  Which is part of the UN.
[2033.76 --> 2038.76]  And so it's a remembrance day of four seafarers.
[2038.86 --> 2042.90]  We're going to be doing barbecue downtown.
[2043.90 --> 2045.80]  And then on Wednesday.
[2046.04 --> 2049.00]  And then we're delaying it a day Thursday here at Roberts Bank.
[2049.00 --> 2052.72]  We're going to have another gathering at the seafarer center.
[2052.72 --> 2055.72]  And be hosting seafarers.
[2055.78 --> 2057.38]  So we like to celebrate that day.
[2057.74 --> 2062.40]  And every year there is a theme to the year.
[2062.40 --> 2068.76]  And this year the theme is My Harassment-Free Ship.
[2069.48 --> 2076.46]  And the theme is based on, it's around the issue of bullying and harassment on board ships.
[2076.76 --> 2079.70]  So when you're thinking about seafarers, you pray for them.
[2080.04 --> 2082.80]  And for us as we serve them.
[2083.60 --> 2088.98]  But it's this idea of, because it is an issue on some.
[2088.98 --> 2094.62]  Especially when you get cross-culturally and different kinds of dynamics on board a ship.
[2095.00 --> 2101.32]  Ships are highly hierarchical in their structure between the various ranks on board.
[2102.06 --> 2106.30]  And so the potential for harassment is there always.
[2106.90 --> 2107.90]  Many ships are great.
[2108.40 --> 2110.00]  There are ships where it's an issue.
[2110.00 --> 2120.64]  So that's our sort of focus this year around for the International Day of the Seafarer.
[2120.92 --> 2126.20]  So I invite you to pray with me now as we prepare to open God's Word.
[2127.34 --> 2133.36]  Heavenly Father, thank you for the gift of your Word.
[2133.36 --> 2141.98]  And the opportunity to reflect and share the gospel message also from our lives to those around us.
[2142.18 --> 2146.72]  And so speak to us today through this passage.
[2147.48 --> 2150.78]  That we can learn from you.
[2150.98 --> 2152.18]  Hear from your Spirit.
[2153.16 --> 2156.06]  And really receive the words that you would have for us.
[2156.16 --> 2157.48]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[2157.90 --> 2158.28]  Amen.
[2158.28 --> 2164.02]  1 Samuel 25 is a familiar text.
[2164.24 --> 2168.70]  I think for many of us, you've heard, probably most of you have heard this story.
[2169.22 --> 2172.72]  And I'll be kind of summarizing it as we work our way through.
[2173.20 --> 2177.18]  But it's that story of David.
[2178.32 --> 2179.48]  Before he's king.
[2180.32 --> 2181.60]  He's a fugitive.
[2181.60 --> 2188.86]  He's on the run and he has a band of other malcontents with him.
[2189.08 --> 2190.80]  About 600, we're told.
[2191.78 --> 2201.46]  And they're in the wilderness and they're wandering around trying to avoid King Saul, who's trying to kill David.
[2201.46 --> 2219.60]  And at one point in time, in this story particularly, it's the time when he's been out in the fields and he's been protecting some of the other shepherds who are out there and their flocks.
[2219.60 --> 2227.26]  And now one of the owners of large flocks, a guy named Naval, was Nabal.
[2228.20 --> 2230.14]  I'm going to pronounce it the Hebrew way, Naval.
[2231.66 --> 2237.54]  Naval is just, it's the end of the season and it's sheep shearing time.
[2238.10 --> 2240.40]  And so he's ready to have a party.
[2241.58 --> 2246.62]  And David decides it's time to cash in on all the good stuff I've been doing for Naval.
[2246.92 --> 2248.40]  So that's that familiar story.
[2248.40 --> 2251.78]  And of course, Naval is married to Abigail.
[2254.08 --> 2258.94]  And so these are sort of the main players in this story.
[2259.80 --> 2261.30]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[2263.38 --> 2270.32]  It's in the seafarers day, as we remember them, it's talking about harassment and bullying.
[2270.62 --> 2274.86]  Well, if he was a bully and a harasser, it's Naval.
[2275.86 --> 2278.16]  He's a nasty bit of work.
[2278.40 --> 2288.02]  And David is going to encounter here now this bully, this fool, Naval.
[2289.58 --> 2300.38]  Now, when I say Naval is the fool, what kind of an image comes to mind?
[2300.38 --> 2303.12]  I don't have the image up.
[2303.28 --> 2307.76]  But I was reminded of, do you remember the old comic, BC?
[2308.40 --> 2313.04]  And he has this one where the guy's riding along in BC.
[2313.22 --> 2314.14]  You know, it's ancient times.
[2314.26 --> 2318.16]  But he's riding along and it says, there's a sign that says, dip in road.
[2318.60 --> 2322.26]  And then there's this guy with this weird face and everything.
[2322.26 --> 2323.52]  And he's the dip, right?
[2323.52 --> 2331.90]  And when we think of fool, we tend to think of these really kind of lesser intelligent people.
[2332.44 --> 2338.02]  Just jerks, but in a really sub-intellectual way, right?
[2338.16 --> 2339.06]  We tend to think of it.
[2339.06 --> 2345.56]  Well, in the case of Naval, that is decidedly not true.
[2346.84 --> 2351.34]  Naval is actually a very successful businessman.
[2351.34 --> 2354.40]  He is wealthy.
[2355.16 --> 2357.14]  He has property.
[2357.96 --> 2361.36]  He has multitudes of flocks.
[2361.96 --> 2364.66]  And he has a beautiful wife.
[2366.00 --> 2372.70]  The guy seems to actually have everything going for him in so many ways.
[2372.70 --> 2384.90]  And so the fool here is not in the sense of some kind of intellectual lack.
[2387.58 --> 2396.28]  Fool in the Old Testament always actually refers to moral deficiency.
[2398.62 --> 2401.16]  Lacking in terms of good morals.
[2401.16 --> 2405.44]  So it's kind of different than the way we usually think of the term fool.
[2405.58 --> 2407.10]  It's not stupidity.
[2407.56 --> 2410.32]  It's actually often he's referred to.
[2410.44 --> 2412.16]  It doesn't come out in the English translation.
[2412.38 --> 2415.86]  But the word that's used several times is evil.
[2418.00 --> 2418.52]  Evil.
[2418.64 --> 2422.52]  In fact, the good and evil come out here in the Hebrew very clearly.
[2423.08 --> 2423.34]  Good.
[2423.34 --> 2428.56]  The terms good and evil are each used seven times in this chapter.
[2430.04 --> 2430.88]  Avigadah.
[2431.16 --> 2433.54]  Naval is evil.
[2435.54 --> 2442.06]  Now, the name Naval actually means fool.
[2442.62 --> 2445.50]  Which raises a question.
[2447.44 --> 2450.88]  Who would name their child fool?
[2450.88 --> 2454.06]  Have you ever thought of that?
[2455.20 --> 2457.18]  Doesn't make much sense, does it?
[2457.64 --> 2458.70]  Why would you name?
[2461.50 --> 2462.64]  And we don't know.
[2463.60 --> 2465.52]  Was this actually his name?
[2466.26 --> 2470.20]  Or was there some other word in Hebrew that we no longer know?
[2470.26 --> 2472.10]  And scholars actually wonder about this.
[2472.22 --> 2473.12]  It's a homonym, right?
[2473.12 --> 2476.32]  It's the same word, but it actually means something completely different.
[2477.28 --> 2478.36]  It could be.
[2479.00 --> 2482.14]  Or was it a nickname that was given to him?
[2482.30 --> 2486.88]  Sort of a play on words and somehow it stuck.
[2486.88 --> 2489.26]  He was Naval.
[2489.26 --> 2490.50]  The fool.
[2490.50 --> 2494.60]  I imagine he didn't like the name very much.
[2494.94 --> 2496.00]  Are you with me?
[2496.00 --> 2507.40]  The reality, though, is he lived, should I say, up to the name or down to the name?
[2507.40 --> 2512.86]  He's referred to in verses 2 to 3.
[2513.12 --> 2514.94]  If you look at your Bibles, 2 and 3.
[2515.78 --> 2516.98]  A certain man from Ma'on.
[2517.04 --> 2522.00]  By the way, Ma'on is in the region of Hebron.
[2522.66 --> 2524.22]  Hebron in the south part.
[2524.22 --> 2529.74]  Because it says here, a certain man from Ma'on who had property there at Carmel.
[2529.90 --> 2532.54]  This is not Mount Carmel, which is up in the north.
[2532.72 --> 2536.52]  This is a Carmel that's in the south side of Israel.
[2537.10 --> 2542.54]  And it means sort of a pleasant place or something like that.
[2542.66 --> 2546.72]  But it's a village in the south, okay, of Israel.
[2547.84 --> 2549.26]  He was very wealthy.
[2549.26 --> 2554.58]  He had 1,000 goats and 3,000 sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.
[2554.84 --> 2558.54]  His name was Naval, and his wife's name was Abigail.
[2559.40 --> 2565.84]  She was an intelligent and beautiful woman,
[2566.14 --> 2571.14]  but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings.
[2571.74 --> 2573.20]  He was a Calebite.
[2573.20 --> 2581.26]  When it says he was surly, the word, I don't know if we use that.
[2589.20 --> 2590.16]  Done with this.
[2591.02 --> 2594.40]  And put it there or something like that.
[2594.58 --> 2595.78]  We'll go back to this.
[2596.04 --> 2596.32]  Sorry.
[2596.62 --> 2597.28]  No more wandering.
[2598.12 --> 2598.72]  I'm staying put.
[2598.72 --> 2606.66]  But he was, it means literally he was harsh, cruel, or severe.
[2607.94 --> 2614.28]  And then the second one, he was mean, it literally is he was evil in his deeds
[2614.28 --> 2617.26]  or in his practices, in the things he did.
[2618.32 --> 2621.68]  He was a nasty guy.
[2621.68 --> 2630.28]  Later in the chapter, in verse 17, if you look at that, verse 17,
[2630.56 --> 2637.82]  when his servants now are telling Abigail about what he did, what a fool he was,
[2638.12 --> 2641.64]  they say, now think it over to Abigail and see what you can do
[2641.64 --> 2644.94]  because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household.
[2645.38 --> 2647.42]  He is such a wicked man.
[2647.42 --> 2652.30]  And the word there for wicked is actually the word, it means like worthless,
[2652.88 --> 2655.70]  but like a worthless scoundrel.
[2655.90 --> 2662.16]  It's the same term that's used when King Ahab wanted Naboth's vineyard.
[2662.40 --> 2663.54]  Remember that story in Kings?
[2664.18 --> 2673.90]  And his wife Jezebel sets up this plot to have two worthless scoundrels.
[2673.90 --> 2674.90]  Same term.
[2676.40 --> 2681.80]  Lie about Naboth so that he's killed and then Ahab can take his vineyard.
[2682.54 --> 2685.20]  He's a worthless man.
[2686.94 --> 2692.92]  Now, the term Naboth, because of this, this and this story,
[2693.40 --> 2698.60]  this story is always connected with Psalm 14.
[2699.74 --> 2700.98]  Remember Psalm 14?
[2700.98 --> 2706.50]  The fool has said in his heart, there is no God.
[2706.62 --> 2710.00]  But in Hebrew, it doesn't say the fool.
[2710.10 --> 2710.70]  There's no article.
[2711.00 --> 2712.32]  It literally says,
[2713.02 --> 2717.14]  Naval has said in his heart, there is no God.
[2718.36 --> 2722.76]  And that's the psalm that's always connected with this passage.
[2722.76 --> 2730.18]  The reality is, there are still a lot of Navals today.
[2731.56 --> 2736.10]  He's not, he's sort of a picture of a Naval of a fool.
[2736.44 --> 2740.00]  But there remain a lot of Navals.
[2740.52 --> 2745.88]  Some of them are wealthy and successful and in positions of power.
[2745.88 --> 2749.08]  The Navals of this world.
[2749.32 --> 2750.26]  And there are many.
[2753.20 --> 2754.04]  That's Naval.
[2756.20 --> 2759.30]  Then we encounter David in the story.
[2760.60 --> 2765.34]  David, as we said, has been protecting Naval's goods.
[2765.34 --> 2769.92]  And now it's the time of celebration.
[2770.66 --> 2774.14]  And he sends a delegation, 10 young men, he says.
[2774.32 --> 2779.60]  They go to Naval and they say, hey, we've been helping you.
[2780.86 --> 2782.14]  A little bit in return.
[2783.14 --> 2788.16]  And it seems, some people say, oh, he's like running a protection scheme or something like that.
[2788.20 --> 2789.20]  It's pretty nasty of David.
[2789.26 --> 2794.82]  But actually, in Middle Eastern hospitality, from what I've told, this is pretty understandable.
[2795.36 --> 2796.70]  You know, I've done this for you.
[2796.96 --> 2799.46]  And now you can maybe do something for me.
[2799.84 --> 2802.62]  He says, give me something back in return.
[2803.28 --> 2805.70]  And David does this actually very gracefully.
[2805.70 --> 2806.98]  Verses 5 to 6.
[2806.98 --> 2815.16]  He says, now I hear that it is, or sorry, verses 5 to 6.
[2815.86 --> 2819.04]  So he sent, actually, I'm going to read it literally, OK?
[2819.18 --> 2822.42]  This is my translation of that verse, those two verses.
[2822.54 --> 2823.60]  Verses 5 to 6.
[2823.70 --> 2825.14]  You can follow it along in the text.
[2825.18 --> 2827.60]  But I'm going to change it to a more literal translation.
[2828.82 --> 2831.72]  So David sent 10 young men.
[2831.72 --> 2843.08]  And David said to the men, go up to Carmel and go to Naval and greet him in my name in peace.
[2844.46 --> 2861.48]  And say thus, to life or long life, peace to you and peace to your house and peace to all that belong to you.
[2861.88 --> 2864.52]  Shalom, shalom, shalom, shalom.
[2865.38 --> 2871.22]  He gives him this really gracious greeting of peace, of shalom, Naval.
[2873.48 --> 2879.16]  And then he goes on in verses 7 to 8, again in your text, verses 7 to 8.
[2879.46 --> 2882.62]  Now, David, the young men say, passing on David's message,
[2882.62 --> 2885.02]  I hear that it is sheep shearing time.
[2885.20 --> 2888.34]  When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them.
[2888.34 --> 2892.40]  And the whole time they were at Carmel, nothing of theirs was missing.
[2893.06 --> 2895.56]  Ask your own servants, and they will tell you.
[2895.66 --> 2897.64]  Therefore, be favorable toward my men.
[2897.98 --> 2904.96]  Since we come at a festive time, please give your servants and your son David.
[2904.96 --> 2906.94]  Notice how deferential he is.
[2906.94 --> 2909.50]  And your son David.
[2910.20 --> 2912.84]  Whatever you can find for them.
[2912.84 --> 2916.18]  So David just makes this appeal to him.
[2917.18 --> 2918.58]  What does Naval do?
[2921.10 --> 2923.06]  Outright refuses.
[2924.20 --> 2928.84]  And not only does he refuse, he insults.
[2928.88 --> 2931.94]  He basically mocks David.
[2931.94 --> 2935.36]  Verses 10 to 11.
[2938.16 --> 2940.18]  Naval answered David's servants,
[2940.48 --> 2942.92]  Who is this, David?
[2944.24 --> 2945.36]  Who is this?
[2945.42 --> 2948.06]  And notice, David has said, your son David.
[2948.50 --> 2951.38]  He says, who is this son of Jesse?
[2951.86 --> 2953.16]  He's not my son.
[2953.16 --> 2959.24]  Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.
[2959.24 --> 2960.98]  Like David from Saul.
[2962.32 --> 2967.88]  Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I have slaughtered for my shears
[2967.88 --> 2972.70]  and give it to men coming from who knows where?
[2973.40 --> 2973.66]  Ooh.
[2975.24 --> 2977.58]  What a slap in the face to David.
[2977.58 --> 2982.52]  And it's just, again, a nasty reply.
[2982.62 --> 2984.28]  He doesn't even try to be diplomatic.
[2986.58 --> 2989.34]  And David doesn't take it well.
[2990.32 --> 2992.32]  To put it mildly, right?
[2992.92 --> 2994.84]  He doesn't take it well at all.
[2995.12 --> 2997.68]  In fact, he's enraged.
[2998.24 --> 3001.56]  And he's intent on vengeance.
[3001.56 --> 3009.16]  Instead of peace, now he says, guys, strap on your swords.
[3010.50 --> 3011.98]  We're heading out.
[3012.04 --> 3012.88]  No more peace.
[3013.72 --> 3016.04]  We are going for revenge.
[3016.34 --> 3019.66]  And of the 600 men, 400 of them go with him.
[3020.36 --> 3024.74]  400 men going to Naval and his servants.
[3025.50 --> 3028.68]  And they're bent on war and on revenge.
[3028.68 --> 3030.72]  David is furious.
[3031.56 --> 3035.66]  Now, David is bent on vengeance.
[3036.04 --> 3042.86]  And the reality is, vengeance is a human tendency.
[3043.22 --> 3048.10]  It's a really common human tendency, right?
[3049.58 --> 3052.20]  We see it in individuals.
[3053.34 --> 3055.80]  We see it in cultures.
[3055.80 --> 3061.22]  We see it in nations and between nations.
[3062.28 --> 3066.94]  We're seeing an explosion in many ways.
[3067.14 --> 3072.86]  Well, over the past almost two years, but especially in the past week plus,
[3072.86 --> 3086.20]  in Israel and in the Middle East, and between Israel and Gaza and Israel and Iran, this vengeance is always at work, at play, right?
[3086.20 --> 3087.46]  You do it to me.
[3087.46 --> 3087.72]  You do it to me.
[3087.72 --> 3089.94]  I have to get you back.
[3090.94 --> 3100.58]  It is so ingrained in us as humans that tit for tat, I'll pay you back.
[3100.58 --> 3108.40]  And that is the reality that is just part of our human tendency.
[3108.40 --> 3116.12]  And you realize pretty soon that the idea of turning the other cheek, you know, we talk about it.
[3116.12 --> 3124.50]  Loving your enemies, loving your enemies, turning the other cheek, and we fail to realize how counterintuitive that is for humans.
[3125.22 --> 3126.56]  We've been ingrained in it.
[3126.60 --> 3133.30]  We've been filled with that in our culture, in our biblical grounding, at least for most of us, probably all of us.
[3133.30 --> 3140.48]  But that idea of turning the other cheek is actually really counterintuitive.
[3140.64 --> 3141.62]  It's unusual.
[3143.18 --> 3153.14]  And the common thing is to pay back the other, to exact vengeance on the other.
[3153.14 --> 3167.98]  I think this is what we're seeing this in, is in our modern culture, we're seeing, especially probably down south of the border, the rise, but in other places too,
[3168.34 --> 3175.14]  a rise in sort of what some people are calling a toxic, tough guy masculinity.
[3175.82 --> 3180.26]  Now, that's working out in different ways, but that's one of the things that's coming up.
[3181.48 --> 3181.96]  Reactionary.
[3181.96 --> 3182.96]  Reactionary.
[3183.02 --> 3193.38]  Anti-immigrant and all this stuff, but the anger that's there in so many of this, of this really toxic sort of, at least I'm speaking from a man's perspective,
[3193.52 --> 3197.54]  the toxic masculinity that's coming up in, in so many ways.
[3197.88 --> 3208.68]  I recently read Russell Moore, who's one of the editors with Christianity Today, and he was saying how pastors, some pastors in the States, he's, that's his context,
[3208.68 --> 3219.28]  he said, are, when they're trying to preach on the Sermon on the Mount, they're getting reaction from their congregations, saying you can't preach that.
[3219.78 --> 3221.68]  Things like turn the other cheek.
[3221.68 --> 3224.30]  People don't want to hear that.
[3224.90 --> 3226.34]  And that's a frightening thing.
[3228.82 --> 3231.46]  But it is so counterintuitive.
[3231.46 --> 3233.18]  And here we have David.
[3233.18 --> 3238.46]  David bent on wrath-filled revenge.
[3238.92 --> 3242.46]  Now I'm going to get my payback.
[3242.46 --> 3256.22]  What's ironic here is this passage, this chapter, is embedded between two other stories on either side.
[3256.22 --> 3269.70]  The two chapters, chapter 24 and chapter 26, are both about the time that David could have gotten revenge on King Saul, and he doesn't.
[3269.70 --> 3282.62]  He says he has the opportunity in both chapters, on both sides of the story, to take revenge, to kill Saul, whether it's in that cave,
[3282.74 --> 3291.20]  or when he's soundly asleep, and they walk into the midst of the camp, and he has the chance to kill Saul, and his men are encouraging him, saying,
[3291.62 --> 3293.88]  kill him, kill him, this is your chance.
[3293.88 --> 3298.80]  And he says, no, no, I can't kill the Lord's anointed.
[3299.92 --> 3302.02]  And he does that for King Saul.
[3302.26 --> 3312.22]  But here, in the midst of that, is this story where he's out for revenge, bent on revenge.
[3315.34 --> 3318.60]  And yet, once again, the Lord stops him.
[3318.60 --> 3325.08]  Now, some people actually think this story is sort of a, it's meant to be sort of a metaphor of Saul.
[3325.16 --> 3327.60]  Not that it's not a true story, but that it's a picture of him.
[3327.68 --> 3337.44]  Others see it as contrasting very much with the story of Saul, because here, David wants to get his revenge on Naval.
[3337.44 --> 3347.00]  David out to get revenge, and they're marching there to take their revenge on King Saul.
[3347.46 --> 3350.32]  And then comes Abigail.
[3352.18 --> 3353.80]  Abigail the wise.
[3354.76 --> 3365.14]  She is, and in all of this, this wisdom and fool idea is really playing into the whole wisdom literature, Proverbs particularly.
[3365.14 --> 3366.54]  This comes up over and over again.
[3366.54 --> 3369.78]  And Abigail is the wise one in this story.
[3370.76 --> 3374.94]  It says, again in verse 3, she's good in insight.
[3375.08 --> 3376.28]  That's what it literally says.
[3376.42 --> 3377.00]  She's intelligent.
[3377.10 --> 3379.54]  But she's good in insight or understanding.
[3379.92 --> 3381.98]  And she's beautiful of form.
[3382.08 --> 3384.18]  She's beautiful inside and out.
[3385.34 --> 3387.44]  But she's the wise one.
[3387.44 --> 3399.00]  And the text highlights her wise actions and her wise words to avert disaster.
[3399.44 --> 3400.32]  And so what does she do?
[3400.68 --> 3405.64]  She prepares a gift of that, a huge gift actually, for David.
[3405.88 --> 3408.58]  And she tells her servants, get all this food ready.
[3408.66 --> 3409.90]  We're going to go meet David.
[3409.90 --> 3419.56]  And she heads out with some of her servants to meet him on the road to hopefully stop him in his path.
[3420.42 --> 3423.04]  Now, you have to picture this.
[3423.92 --> 3435.06]  David is marching towards her with 400 of his men, armed for war with their swords strapped on.
[3435.06 --> 3440.80]  And along comes essentially Abigail, almost alone.
[3441.14 --> 3442.82]  She's got like five servants with her.
[3442.88 --> 3445.18]  But she's basically coming on her own.
[3445.50 --> 3446.96]  And she meets David.
[3447.42 --> 3454.58]  And you have to recognize here, Abigail is really, in this context, is marginalized, right?
[3455.26 --> 3460.98]  One, she's a woman facing 401 men.
[3460.98 --> 3464.30]  In a man's world.
[3465.06 --> 3472.58]  At the same time, she's facing this army.
[3473.76 --> 3477.46]  She's alone before all 400 of them.
[3477.84 --> 3481.20]  I get the image that comes up in my mind when I was reading this.
[3481.60 --> 3482.58]  Was that image, do you remember?
[3482.74 --> 3485.46]  Way back, 1989, Tiananmen Square.
[3485.46 --> 3490.46]  And they had the uprising against the government there of China.
[3490.68 --> 3497.88]  And that one, that picture of that tank and that one lone Chinese man who stands in front of the tank.
[3498.38 --> 3499.32]  Do you remember that picture?
[3499.78 --> 3500.74]  I should have put it on.
[3500.74 --> 3503.64]  And he keeps moving side to side when the tank moves.
[3504.68 --> 3506.26]  That's like what Abigail is.
[3506.26 --> 3509.00]  She's approaching David.
[3509.00 --> 3512.08]  And he's bent on revenge.
[3512.08 --> 3521.70]  And she comes alone, essentially, as a woman to try and stop an army.
[3521.70 --> 3525.18]  Wow.
[3525.18 --> 3530.90]  And she gets down and she bows on the ground in obeisance to him.
[3531.00 --> 3535.78]  And then she gives this incredible speech.
[3537.06 --> 3540.34]  I mean, it really is a masterpiece.
[3540.34 --> 3545.24]  It's in verses 23 to 31.
[3545.36 --> 3546.36]  I'd like to read all of that.
[3547.30 --> 3548.36]  23 to 31.
[3549.36 --> 3555.52]  When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.
[3555.52 --> 3557.52]  She fell at his feet and said,
[3558.38 --> 3561.66]  Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you.
[3561.94 --> 3563.86]  Hear what your servant has to say.
[3564.56 --> 3568.18]  Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man, Naval.
[3568.18 --> 3570.54]  He is just like his name.
[3570.94 --> 3574.56]  His name means fool and folly goes with him.
[3575.56 --> 3579.18]  And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent.
[3579.28 --> 3583.00]  And now, my lord, as surely as the lord your god lives and as you live,
[3583.42 --> 3588.78]  since the lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands,
[3589.26 --> 3594.04]  may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Naval.
[3594.04 --> 3600.14]  And let this gift which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the men who follow you.
[3601.06 --> 3603.30]  Please forgive your servant's presumption.
[3603.88 --> 3608.34]  The lord your god will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord
[3608.34 --> 3610.96]  because you fight the lord's battles
[3610.96 --> 3614.78]  and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live.
[3614.78 --> 3617.94]  Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life,
[3618.38 --> 3624.62]  the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living
[3624.62 --> 3626.40]  by the lord your god,
[3626.76 --> 3628.24]  but the lives of your enemies
[3628.24 --> 3632.26]  he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.
[3632.90 --> 3634.88]  When the lord has fulfilled for my lord
[3634.88 --> 3637.68]  every good thing he promised concerning him
[3637.68 --> 3639.74]  and has appointed him ruler over Israel,
[3639.74 --> 3644.12]  my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden
[3644.12 --> 3646.56]  of needless bloodshed
[3646.56 --> 3648.86]  or of having avenged himself.
[3649.26 --> 3653.18]  And when the lord your god has brought my lord success,
[3653.78 --> 3656.16]  remember your servant.
[3656.90 --> 3658.16]  It's a beautiful speech.
[3658.70 --> 3661.92]  It's actually strikingly similar to a later speech
[3661.92 --> 3664.94]  of the wise woman of Tekoa
[3664.94 --> 3668.30]  whom Joab later will send to David
[3668.30 --> 3672.72]  when he's trying to have David bring back Absalom
[3672.72 --> 3676.50]  from his banishment.
[3676.94 --> 3678.22]  It's in 2 Samuel 14.
[3678.30 --> 3679.54]  If you get a chance, check it out.
[3680.02 --> 3683.08]  The speeches are actually somewhat similar.
[3684.08 --> 3686.82]  But she gives this amazing speech.
[3687.00 --> 3688.74]  And notice especially what it says.
[3689.12 --> 3692.84]  One, she's saving David from blood guilt,
[3692.84 --> 3696.88]  from having blood on his hands.
[3698.72 --> 3699.94]  Unnecessary blood.
[3700.94 --> 3703.54]  Not like Joab.
[3704.34 --> 3705.12]  Remember Joab?
[3705.22 --> 3708.46]  Joab in 1 Kings 2.
[3709.00 --> 3711.28]  David, when he's giving his final instructions
[3711.28 --> 3713.78]  before he passes away to Solomon, the new king,
[3714.14 --> 3714.64]  he says,
[3715.12 --> 3717.28]  Now, Solomon, you yourself know
[3717.28 --> 3720.56]  what Joab, son of Zeruiah, did to me.
[3720.56 --> 3723.80]  What he did to the two commanders of Israel's army,
[3723.98 --> 3726.48]  Abner, son of Ner, and Amasa, son of Jether.
[3726.66 --> 3730.06]  He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime
[3730.06 --> 3731.32]  as if in battle.
[3731.52 --> 3732.64]  And with that blood,
[3732.84 --> 3735.62]  he stained the belt around his waist
[3735.62 --> 3736.98]  and the sandals on his feet.
[3737.12 --> 3738.12]  I'm not like that.
[3738.26 --> 3739.38]  David could say that
[3739.38 --> 3741.60]  because he didn't kill Nabal.
[3741.60 --> 3743.88]  You don't want that blood guilt.
[3743.96 --> 3744.90]  Remember Lady Macbeth?
[3745.82 --> 3746.60]  Lady Macbeth?
[3747.56 --> 3748.54]  Always rubbing her.
[3749.26 --> 3751.30]  She tries and tries and tries
[3751.30 --> 3752.46]  to get the spot out
[3752.46 --> 3754.46]  from the assassination of King Duncan.
[3754.82 --> 3755.54]  And she's trying,
[3755.66 --> 3757.66]  but it just won't go away.
[3758.10 --> 3759.54]  She can't get rid of it.
[3759.98 --> 3760.38]  She says,
[3760.48 --> 3762.44]  David, you don't want that hanging over you.
[3763.24 --> 3764.96]  You don't want that kind of blood guilt.
[3764.96 --> 3767.28]  And then she says too,
[3767.48 --> 3768.28]  and David,
[3768.44 --> 3769.98]  you don't want to be the kind
[3769.98 --> 3772.68]  who works your own salvation.
[3773.24 --> 3775.06]  By your own hand,
[3775.40 --> 3777.38]  you try to redeem yourself
[3777.38 --> 3778.82]  and save yourself.
[3778.88 --> 3779.82]  And that's the word that's used
[3779.82 --> 3781.16]  several times actually in here.
[3781.24 --> 3781.96]  It doesn't come out in English,
[3782.26 --> 3783.74]  but it's to save yourself.
[3784.24 --> 3785.30]  You don't want to be the one
[3785.30 --> 3788.70]  that's trying to do that on your own, David.
[3789.00 --> 3790.34]  That's not for you to do.
[3790.90 --> 3792.56]  Let God work.
[3792.56 --> 3795.28]  You fight the Lord's battles.
[3796.98 --> 3798.82]  Let the Lord do his work.
[3800.26 --> 3802.06]  And especially verse 29.
[3802.44 --> 3803.02]  Verse 29.
[3803.14 --> 3803.74]  Look at that again.
[3804.82 --> 3806.52]  Even though someone is pursuing you
[3806.52 --> 3807.90]  to take your life,
[3808.40 --> 3809.18]  the life of my Lord
[3809.18 --> 3810.46]  will be bound securely
[3810.46 --> 3812.42]  in the bundle of the living
[3812.42 --> 3814.26]  by the Lord your God.
[3814.58 --> 3815.64]  But the lives of your enemies
[3815.64 --> 3816.72]  he will hurl away
[3816.72 --> 3818.42]  as from the pocket of a sling.
[3818.58 --> 3819.88]  Now, when he mentions,
[3820.04 --> 3820.90]  she mentions, sorry,
[3820.90 --> 3822.36]  the pocket of the sling,
[3822.36 --> 3823.22]  David inevitably
[3823.22 --> 3824.34]  is going to be remembering,
[3824.76 --> 3825.86]  oh, someone else he killed
[3825.86 --> 3826.56]  with a sling.
[3827.40 --> 3827.84]  Goliath.
[3828.98 --> 3831.30]  Where God brought that victory.
[3832.74 --> 3834.32]  And then she says,
[3834.50 --> 3835.40]  but just before that,
[3835.78 --> 3837.36]  your life will be bound,
[3838.08 --> 3840.98]  bound in the bundle of the living.
[3841.08 --> 3842.54]  I want to show you this slide now,
[3842.84 --> 3843.64]  Lori, if you could do that.
[3844.08 --> 3845.30]  This is actually a picture.
[3845.36 --> 3846.20]  I hope you can see it.
[3846.86 --> 3848.50]  When Jenny and I last,
[3849.18 --> 3849.70]  a year ago,
[3850.08 --> 3852.00]  we were in Europe,
[3852.14 --> 3852.94]  we were in Vienna.
[3853.10 --> 3853.98]  I had a sabbatical.
[3854.86 --> 3855.76]  And we were in Vienna.
[3855.98 --> 3857.08]  And that is the place
[3857.08 --> 3859.10]  where Jenny's grandfather,
[3860.14 --> 3861.44]  her grandmother
[3861.44 --> 3862.78]  and her mother and sister,
[3862.96 --> 3863.38]  her aunt,
[3863.76 --> 3866.68]  escaped from just in 38,
[3866.86 --> 3868.44]  just after the Nazis marched in.
[3868.80 --> 3869.96]  Her grandfather had stayed back
[3869.96 --> 3870.46]  for a little while.
[3870.46 --> 3871.66]  He was caught by the Gestapo
[3871.66 --> 3873.22]  and tortured and killed.
[3873.72 --> 3874.74]  And this is his grave.
[3875.32 --> 3877.36]  We came there to actually,
[3877.52 --> 3879.40]  part of our work was to,
[3880.18 --> 3881.48]  you can see the gravestone
[3881.48 --> 3882.90]  was just completely faded.
[3883.02 --> 3883.94]  You can't read it at all.
[3884.08 --> 3885.42]  So we had a new gravestone.
[3885.52 --> 3886.58]  Now the next one,
[3886.64 --> 3887.66]  you can see it close up.
[3889.88 --> 3892.78]  This is his gravestone.
[3893.62 --> 3896.28]  Here lies engineer Simon Askenazi.
[3896.86 --> 3898.04]  It has his date of birth,
[3898.04 --> 3899.46]  his date of death.
[3900.08 --> 3901.86]  And then if you notice at the bottom,
[3902.52 --> 3905.56]  it has five Hebrew letters.
[3906.66 --> 3910.90]  And most Jewish gravestones have that.
[3913.12 --> 3914.22]  Those five,
[3914.32 --> 3916.40]  tab, nun, sade, bet, hey,
[3916.70 --> 3918.30]  those five are,
[3918.54 --> 3919.40]  it's an acronym.
[3920.32 --> 3922.16]  And it's an acronym that,
[3922.92 --> 3924.14]  it's a bit of a paraphrase,
[3924.24 --> 3925.06]  it's a slight paraphrase,
[3925.16 --> 3926.94]  but it's basically taken
[3926.94 --> 3928.34]  from this verse.
[3929.78 --> 3931.28]  And what it says is,
[3931.34 --> 3932.72]  they add the tab is different,
[3932.84 --> 3933.34]  but it says,
[3934.06 --> 3934.34]  may,
[3935.00 --> 3935.86]  in this case his,
[3935.94 --> 3936.32]  it will say,
[3936.42 --> 3937.94]  may his or her name
[3938.48 --> 3944.90]  be bound in the bundle,
[3944.98 --> 3945.84]  life, actually,
[3946.00 --> 3946.54]  sorry, nefesh,
[3946.86 --> 3947.20]  life,
[3947.32 --> 3948.46]  may his or her life
[3948.46 --> 3950.52]  be bound in the bundle
[3950.52 --> 3951.92]  of the living of life.
[3951.92 --> 3953.06]  The bundle of the living of life.
[3953.58 --> 3954.66]  It's a beautiful phrase.
[3955.04 --> 3955.32]  Actually,
[3955.52 --> 3956.56]  it was Jenny who,
[3956.80 --> 3957.68]  she was reading through this text.
[3957.74 --> 3958.36]  I'm going to read through it,
[3958.44 --> 3958.62]  and she,
[3958.78 --> 3959.86]  she's the one who caught this.
[3959.92 --> 3960.20]  She said,
[3960.52 --> 3961.92]  I think that's what's on the gravestones.
[3962.92 --> 3963.68]  And sure enough,
[3963.72 --> 3964.22]  we looked it up,
[3964.24 --> 3965.42]  and this is where it's from.
[3966.08 --> 3967.12]  May your life
[3967.12 --> 3968.38]  be bound
[3968.38 --> 3970.00]  in the bundle of the living.
[3970.08 --> 3971.38]  It's a beautiful phrase.
[3973.30 --> 3974.52]  Comes from this text.
[3974.68 --> 3974.96]  David,
[3975.12 --> 3976.36]  that's what you want.
[3976.36 --> 3979.32]  And in her wise
[3979.32 --> 3980.56]  and beautiful way,
[3980.92 --> 3981.32]  Abigail
[3981.32 --> 3983.58]  is a prophetess.
[3987.30 --> 3988.38]  Verse 28.
[3990.12 --> 3991.26]  Even though someone,
[3991.44 --> 3991.74]  oh, sorry,
[3991.86 --> 3992.46]  verse 28.
[3993.18 --> 3995.16]  Please forgive your servants' presumption.
[3995.36 --> 3996.10]  The Lord your God
[3996.10 --> 3997.50]  will certainly make
[3997.50 --> 4000.44]  a lasting dynasty.
[4000.92 --> 4002.42]  The word in Hebrew is,
[4002.74 --> 4003.48]  literally means
[4003.48 --> 4005.08]  a sure house.
[4005.08 --> 4006.64]  a sure house.
[4006.88 --> 4007.76]  That's important
[4007.76 --> 4009.08]  because later,
[4009.38 --> 4011.44]  later in,
[4011.44 --> 4014.92]  in 2 Samuel 7,
[4015.34 --> 4016.26]  the prophet Nathan
[4016.26 --> 4018.12]  says the exact same thing
[4018.12 --> 4019.02]  about David.
[4019.68 --> 4020.60]  The prophet Nathan
[4020.60 --> 4022.02]  says,
[4022.14 --> 4023.04]  when David wants to build
[4023.04 --> 4023.52]  the,
[4023.52 --> 4024.38]  the,
[4024.44 --> 4024.58]  the,
[4024.58 --> 4025.78]  the temple,
[4026.10 --> 4026.86]  and God says,
[4026.96 --> 4027.12]  no,
[4027.22 --> 4028.38]  but I will make of you
[4028.38 --> 4029.72]  a sure house.
[4030.08 --> 4031.20]  I will establish you.
[4032.08 --> 4033.02]  Uses the same phrase.
[4033.20 --> 4034.26]  And this has led
[4034.26 --> 4036.48]  the rabbis,
[4036.62 --> 4037.44]  Talmudic rabbis
[4037.44 --> 4038.58]  in the early centuries
[4038.58 --> 4039.38]  of the common era.
[4039.78 --> 4040.52]  Talmudic rabbis
[4040.52 --> 4042.02]  have referred to
[4042.02 --> 4042.64]  Abigail
[4042.64 --> 4044.34]  as one
[4044.34 --> 4045.56]  of seven
[4045.56 --> 4046.54]  Old Testament
[4046.54 --> 4047.78]  prophetesses
[4047.78 --> 4049.02]  graced
[4049.02 --> 4050.72]  with the Holy Spirit
[4050.72 --> 4052.48]  to speak
[4052.48 --> 4053.64]  God's word
[4053.64 --> 4056.28]  to even David.
[4056.94 --> 4058.14]  She's a prophetess,
[4058.28 --> 4058.88]  one of seven
[4058.88 --> 4059.68]  that are recognized
[4059.68 --> 4060.82]  by the rabbis
[4060.82 --> 4062.10]  in the Old Testament.
[4064.60 --> 4066.40]  David hears her words
[4066.40 --> 4068.60]  and he blesses her,
[4068.88 --> 4070.56]  32 to 33.
[4071.28 --> 4072.28]  David said to Abigail,
[4073.14 --> 4073.66]  ah,
[4074.24 --> 4075.14]  it's,
[4075.28 --> 4075.48]  it's,
[4075.52 --> 4076.02]  I'm going to read it
[4076.02 --> 4076.62]  in the ESV.
[4076.62 --> 4080.18]  because it's,
[4080.54 --> 4081.92]  they get it more accurately.
[4082.80 --> 4083.90]  And David said to Abigail,
[4084.48 --> 4085.92]  blessed be the Lord,
[4086.56 --> 4087.46]  the God of Israel,
[4087.58 --> 4088.94]  who sent you this day
[4088.94 --> 4089.30]  to me.
[4089.70 --> 4091.04]  Blessed be your discretion
[4091.04 --> 4092.30]  and blessed
[4092.30 --> 4093.50]  be you.
[4093.56 --> 4093.78]  Again,
[4093.84 --> 4095.48]  a threefold blessing.
[4096.16 --> 4097.42]  You who have kept me
[4097.42 --> 4098.66]  this day from blood guilt
[4098.66 --> 4100.44]  and from working salvation
[4100.44 --> 4102.36]  with my own hand.
[4103.30 --> 4103.86]  Bless,
[4104.48 --> 4104.98]  bless,
[4104.98 --> 4106.02]  bless,
[4106.34 --> 4107.48]  he says to her.
[4107.82 --> 4108.96]  And then he closes
[4108.96 --> 4110.36]  with the words
[4110.36 --> 4112.14]  of verse 35.
[4112.98 --> 4114.02]  Then David accepted
[4114.02 --> 4114.76]  from her hand
[4114.76 --> 4116.02]  what she had brought him
[4116.02 --> 4116.82]  and said,
[4117.44 --> 4117.98]  go home
[4117.98 --> 4119.04]  in shalom,
[4119.86 --> 4120.58]  in peace.
[4121.86 --> 4123.06]  Return to peace.
[4124.62 --> 4126.28]  I've heard your words
[4126.28 --> 4127.72]  and granted your request.
[4127.78 --> 4128.40]  Now think about it.
[4128.68 --> 4129.62]  David could have answered
[4129.62 --> 4130.48]  her very differently.
[4130.88 --> 4131.60]  He could have said,
[4131.92 --> 4132.70]  forget it,
[4132.78 --> 4132.98]  lady.
[4132.98 --> 4135.20]  we're gone.
[4135.90 --> 4137.34]  But he heard
[4137.34 --> 4138.26]  her words.
[4139.22 --> 4140.72]  He heeded them.
[4141.64 --> 4142.14]  He listened
[4142.14 --> 4142.84]  and obeyed.
[4146.10 --> 4146.70]  Well,
[4146.74 --> 4147.98]  we have three actors,
[4148.14 --> 4148.94]  but finally we have
[4148.94 --> 4149.38]  one more.
[4149.62 --> 4150.04]  And of course,
[4150.10 --> 4151.14]  that's the primary one,
[4151.32 --> 4151.64]  God.
[4152.46 --> 4153.54]  Because it's God
[4153.54 --> 4154.38]  who is at work
[4154.38 --> 4155.00]  in this.
[4155.76 --> 4156.96]  And it's God
[4156.96 --> 4157.84]  who eventually
[4157.84 --> 4159.28]  brings the final fate
[4159.28 --> 4159.90]  of Naval,
[4159.90 --> 4161.60]  verses 36 to 38.
[4162.16 --> 4162.78]  When Abigail
[4162.78 --> 4163.74]  went to Naval
[4163.74 --> 4165.04]  after she returned
[4165.04 --> 4165.54]  from David,
[4166.10 --> 4167.28]  he was in the house
[4167.28 --> 4167.98]  holding,
[4168.26 --> 4168.76]  listen to this,
[4168.94 --> 4170.42]  a banquet like that
[4170.42 --> 4171.14]  of literally
[4171.14 --> 4172.06]  the king.
[4172.56 --> 4173.90]  He thinks he's a king.
[4174.66 --> 4175.56]  It's ironic
[4175.56 --> 4176.48]  because she's just
[4176.48 --> 4177.44]  met the true king,
[4178.10 --> 4179.04]  the real king,
[4179.30 --> 4181.02]  but now he's holding
[4181.02 --> 4182.10]  a feast like a king.
[4182.10 --> 4184.68]  He was in high spirits
[4184.68 --> 4185.78]  and very drunk,
[4185.94 --> 4186.84]  so she told him
[4186.84 --> 4187.94]  nothing at all
[4187.94 --> 4188.70]  until daybreak.
[4188.88 --> 4189.54]  Then in the morning,
[4190.04 --> 4191.60]  when Naval was sober,
[4192.72 --> 4194.36]  his wife told him
[4194.36 --> 4195.32]  all these things
[4195.32 --> 4196.64]  and his heart
[4196.64 --> 4197.28]  failed him
[4197.28 --> 4198.76]  and he became
[4198.76 --> 4200.38]  like a stone.
[4201.10 --> 4201.76]  Interesting
[4201.76 --> 4202.48]  because remember
[4202.48 --> 4204.62]  in Ezekiel 36,
[4205.60 --> 4206.64]  Ezekiel promises
[4206.64 --> 4208.18]  that with the
[4208.18 --> 4209.16]  restoration of Israel,
[4209.16 --> 4210.22]  I'll turn your
[4210.22 --> 4210.98]  heart of stone
[4210.98 --> 4212.52]  into a heart of flesh.
[4212.90 --> 4213.32]  I'll give you
[4213.32 --> 4213.86]  a new heart.
[4214.36 --> 4214.68]  Here,
[4216.14 --> 4216.78]  Naval goes the
[4216.78 --> 4217.38]  other direction.
[4218.14 --> 4218.74]  His heart
[4218.74 --> 4220.00]  goes from flesh
[4220.00 --> 4221.22]  to stone.
[4222.62 --> 4223.70]  About 10 days
[4223.70 --> 4224.00]  later,
[4224.12 --> 4225.06]  the Lord struck
[4225.06 --> 4225.58]  Naval
[4225.58 --> 4227.32]  and he died.
[4228.38 --> 4228.90]  God
[4228.90 --> 4229.80]  brings
[4229.80 --> 4230.56]  the vengeance.
[4231.84 --> 4232.88]  What does God say?
[4234.04 --> 4234.76]  Vengeance
[4234.76 --> 4236.04]  is mine,
[4236.98 --> 4237.70]  says the Lord.
[4238.48 --> 4239.38]  And those are the words
[4239.38 --> 4240.70]  in Deuteronomy
[4240.70 --> 4242.02]  and again
[4242.02 --> 4243.08]  in twice
[4243.08 --> 4244.00]  in the New Testament.
[4244.64 --> 4245.30]  Leave it
[4245.30 --> 4246.24]  to God.
[4246.78 --> 4247.74]  You don't need.
[4247.80 --> 4248.34]  Let God
[4248.34 --> 4249.40]  be the just judge.
[4249.74 --> 4250.64]  He's the one
[4250.64 --> 4251.32]  who can handle
[4251.32 --> 4251.96]  these issues.
[4252.62 --> 4253.32]  Don't you
[4253.32 --> 4254.20]  take revenge.
[4254.52 --> 4255.26]  And it's a
[4255.26 --> 4256.02]  sober warning
[4256.02 --> 4256.74]  to all of us
[4256.74 --> 4258.12]  who maybe
[4258.12 --> 4259.16]  want to get revenge
[4259.16 --> 4260.44]  or just feel
[4260.44 --> 4261.58]  like some kind
[4261.58 --> 4262.82]  of action
[4262.82 --> 4263.66]  needs to be taken.
[4263.94 --> 4264.40]  Wait a minute.
[4265.18 --> 4266.20]  Leave it to God.
[4267.04 --> 4267.72]  Trust in him.
[4268.00 --> 4269.16]  He'll work out
[4269.16 --> 4273.38]  things in the right way.
[4276.14 --> 4276.84]  Naval's fate,
[4277.02 --> 4277.44]  interestingly,
[4277.74 --> 4278.98]  is sort of
[4278.98 --> 4279.96]  tied in with
[4279.96 --> 4280.64]  the
[4280.64 --> 4283.18]  remember the story
[4283.18 --> 4284.56]  of the wealthy man
[4284.56 --> 4285.80]  Jesus' parable
[4285.80 --> 4287.42]  in Luke 12
[4287.42 --> 4288.94]  when the man,
[4289.04 --> 4289.20]  you know,
[4289.24 --> 4289.58]  he says,
[4289.78 --> 4291.06]  I've got so much stuff
[4291.06 --> 4291.86]  I have to build more
[4291.86 --> 4293.08]  and more barns
[4293.08 --> 4293.94]  and I've got to
[4293.94 --> 4295.78]  add more to it
[4295.78 --> 4297.04]  and then he rests
[4297.04 --> 4298.00]  back on his laurels.
[4298.08 --> 4298.36]  He says,
[4298.46 --> 4299.76]  now I can just relax
[4299.76 --> 4300.18]  and eat,
[4300.42 --> 4300.70]  drink,
[4300.80 --> 4301.78]  and be merry.
[4302.60 --> 4303.48]  And what does
[4303.48 --> 4304.88]  the Lord say to him?
[4304.88 --> 4306.12]  12,
[4306.12 --> 4307.90]  sorry,
[4307.98 --> 4308.30]  12,
[4308.44 --> 4308.96]  16,
[4309.34 --> 4309.88]  it is,
[4309.92 --> 4310.70]  I think it's 20.
[4311.28 --> 4312.48]  But God said to him,
[4312.90 --> 4314.18]  you fool,
[4314.18 --> 4315.18]  you fool,
[4315.18 --> 4317.26]  you fool,
[4317.94 --> 4318.82]  this very night
[4318.82 --> 4319.46]  your life will be
[4319.46 --> 4320.38]  demanded from you.
[4320.80 --> 4321.28]  Then you,
[4321.40 --> 4322.10]  who will get what
[4322.10 --> 4322.68]  you have prepared
[4322.68 --> 4323.18]  for yourself?
[4323.48 --> 4324.68]  This is how it will be
[4324.68 --> 4326.10]  with whoever
[4326.10 --> 4327.00]  stores up things
[4327.00 --> 4327.72]  for themselves
[4327.72 --> 4328.98]  but is not rich
[4328.98 --> 4330.42]  towards God,
[4331.18 --> 4331.98]  you fool.
[4331.98 --> 4333.94]  and it's as if God
[4333.94 --> 4335.18]  says that to Nabal
[4335.18 --> 4335.78]  himself,
[4336.12 --> 4337.20]  you fool.
[4338.24 --> 4338.50]  Well,
[4338.58 --> 4338.88]  God,
[4339.44 --> 4339.78]  therefore,
[4339.96 --> 4341.82]  he saves David,
[4342.82 --> 4344.70]  he rescues him
[4344.70 --> 4345.98]  from his enemies,
[4346.14 --> 4347.04]  from Nabal,
[4347.44 --> 4349.40]  and later from Saul,
[4350.12 --> 4351.64]  and from other enemies,
[4352.22 --> 4354.08]  but he also rescues
[4354.08 --> 4355.76]  David from himself.
[4355.76 --> 4360.08]  David bent on revenge
[4360.08 --> 4361.42]  and it's as if
[4361.42 --> 4363.20]  God calls him back
[4363.20 --> 4364.18]  and says there's
[4364.18 --> 4364.98]  a better way,
[4365.10 --> 4365.34]  David,
[4365.94 --> 4367.72]  don't do that.
[4368.56 --> 4369.64]  And he does it
[4369.64 --> 4371.60]  through Abigail,
[4372.46 --> 4375.06]  beautiful Abigail.
[4376.18 --> 4376.40]  Now,
[4376.46 --> 4377.02]  Eugene Peterson,
[4377.16 --> 4377.94]  when he talks about this,
[4378.00 --> 4378.96]  he makes a big deal
[4378.96 --> 4379.94]  about the beauty,
[4380.32 --> 4381.48]  the beauty of Abigail
[4381.48 --> 4382.64]  and the beauty
[4382.64 --> 4384.02]  of the way God
[4384.02 --> 4385.74]  speaks into our lives.
[4386.06 --> 4386.50]  And he says,
[4386.72 --> 4388.08]  she's almost like,
[4388.16 --> 4388.46]  he says,
[4388.52 --> 4389.44]  when I think of Abigail,
[4389.74 --> 4391.30]  I think of an icon.
[4392.12 --> 4393.26]  An icon literally
[4393.26 --> 4394.40]  is Greek for image,
[4394.52 --> 4395.10]  but you know,
[4395.16 --> 4395.50]  icons,
[4395.66 --> 4397.56]  those Eastern Orthodox
[4397.56 --> 4399.64]  sort of stylized paintings,
[4399.88 --> 4400.72]  but they're meant
[4400.72 --> 4401.48]  to usher us
[4401.48 --> 4402.08]  into a place
[4402.08 --> 4403.74]  of prayer and worship.
[4404.64 --> 4405.84]  And he says this
[4405.84 --> 4407.58]  about the icon.
[4408.44 --> 4409.18]  Icons are,
[4409.18 --> 4409.56]  quote,
[4409.56 --> 4411.80]  an image that works
[4411.80 --> 4413.18]  in such a way
[4413.18 --> 4414.84]  that the beauty
[4414.84 --> 4416.08]  of the Lord
[4416.08 --> 4417.76]  pours through it.
[4418.00 --> 4419.30]  A person who lives
[4419.30 --> 4420.02]  in such a way
[4420.02 --> 4421.24]  that the beauty
[4421.24 --> 4422.34]  of the Lord
[4422.34 --> 4424.60]  streams through.
[4426.24 --> 4427.66]  Abigail is that
[4427.66 --> 4428.58]  kind of person.
[4429.80 --> 4430.82]  God's beauty
[4430.82 --> 4432.06]  streaming through
[4432.06 --> 4434.38]  and calling back
[4434.38 --> 4435.92]  the likes of a David,
[4436.78 --> 4437.58]  restoring him,
[4437.58 --> 4437.80]  really,
[4438.08 --> 4439.36]  to who he's meant
[4439.36 --> 4440.02]  to be.
[4445.54 --> 4446.04]  Well,
[4446.12 --> 4447.36]  our true icon,
[4448.02 --> 4448.56]  of course,
[4448.72 --> 4449.44]  is Jesus,
[4449.88 --> 4451.96]  who gives us
[4451.96 --> 4452.60]  that beautiful,
[4452.72 --> 4453.74]  his beautiful message,
[4453.86 --> 4455.24]  the gospel message,
[4455.70 --> 4457.46]  and with that,
[4457.60 --> 4459.10]  arrests our own
[4459.10 --> 4462.14]  bent towards revenge,
[4462.46 --> 4463.20]  towards anger,
[4463.42 --> 4464.26]  towards sin.
[4464.26 --> 4465.20]  and he says,
[4465.30 --> 4465.76]  come back.
[4465.82 --> 4466.94]  But I love the way
[4466.94 --> 4468.08]  he comes with
[4468.08 --> 4469.04]  a beautiful,
[4469.38 --> 4471.08]  a beautiful message.
[4472.42 --> 4473.34]  And I want to
[4473.34 --> 4474.50]  ask myself
[4474.50 --> 4476.10]  and ourselves
[4476.10 --> 4478.76]  and our Christian world,
[4479.00 --> 4480.94]  are we giving
[4480.94 --> 4482.06]  that same kind
[4482.06 --> 4483.78]  of a beautiful message
[4483.78 --> 4486.48]  to the world around us?
[4486.48 --> 4488.22]  the kind that actually
[4488.22 --> 4488.98]  attracts,
[4489.10 --> 4489.80]  because I fear
[4489.80 --> 4491.08]  in many cases
[4491.08 --> 4492.78]  we more tend
[4492.78 --> 4494.06]  to turn people away
[4494.06 --> 4495.26]  than we actually attract.
[4495.92 --> 4497.16]  And this is a message
[4497.16 --> 4498.96]  that draws people.
[4500.42 --> 4501.88]  It arrests them
[4501.88 --> 4504.26]  because it's
[4504.26 --> 4506.12]  a beautiful message.
[4506.30 --> 4507.42]  May our lives
[4507.42 --> 4510.24]  be a beautiful witness
[4510.24 --> 4512.44]  as we reflect
[4512.44 --> 4514.50]  Jesus' gospel,
[4514.72 --> 4515.58]  the good news
[4515.58 --> 4516.24]  about Jesus
[4516.24 --> 4517.58]  to those around us.
[4517.66 --> 4518.06]  Let's pray.
[4518.58 --> 4519.52]  Father, thank you
[4519.52 --> 4521.36]  for this word,
[4521.66 --> 4522.54]  this beautiful word
[4522.54 --> 4523.56]  that calls us
[4523.56 --> 4524.70]  to be your people,
[4525.54 --> 4526.26]  calls us,
[4526.48 --> 4527.28]  called David
[4527.28 --> 4528.18]  way back then
[4528.18 --> 4529.70]  to live
[4529.70 --> 4530.96]  in a better way.
[4531.34 --> 4532.80]  And it calls us
[4532.80 --> 4533.62]  to be a people
[4533.62 --> 4534.86]  who live,
[4536.32 --> 4537.84]  to live as you
[4537.84 --> 4538.72]  would have us live.
[4538.72 --> 4540.96]  help us
[4540.96 --> 4541.66]  to be able
[4541.66 --> 4542.76]  to be the kind
[4542.76 --> 4543.28]  of people
[4543.28 --> 4544.70]  through your
[4544.70 --> 4545.68]  spirit's work
[4545.68 --> 4546.32]  in our lives
[4546.32 --> 4547.48]  who
[4547.48 --> 4550.38]  draw
[4550.38 --> 4551.52]  others,
[4551.60 --> 4552.30]  who reflect
[4552.30 --> 4553.30]  a beautiful
[4553.30 --> 4554.16]  message
[4554.16 --> 4554.98]  to the world
[4554.98 --> 4555.52]  around us
[4555.52 --> 4556.36]  so that we too
[4556.36 --> 4557.84]  can reflect
[4557.84 --> 4558.52]  your glory,
[4559.26 --> 4559.84]  your beauty,
[4560.54 --> 4561.52]  the beauty
[4561.52 --> 4562.24]  of holiness
[4562.24 --> 4563.50]  as the psalmist says,
[4563.74 --> 4564.42]  the splendor
[4564.42 --> 4564.94]  of holiness
[4564.94 --> 4566.52]  that is in you.
[4567.92 --> 4568.66]  And Lord,
[4568.72 --> 4569.54]  may that be true
[4569.54 --> 4570.42]  in our lives
[4570.42 --> 4572.20]  and in all
[4572.20 --> 4572.62]  that we do
[4572.62 --> 4573.04]  and say.
[4573.86 --> 4574.66]  Bless this word
[4574.66 --> 4575.20]  to our lives,
[4575.28 --> 4576.36]  we pray in Jesus' name.
[4576.84 --> 4577.20]  Amen.
[4578.72 --> 4579.74]  And we will now
[4579.74 --> 4580.82]  sing another song.
[4580.96 --> 4581.36]  Amen.
[4581.36 --> 4592.66]  David learned
[4592.66 --> 4593.66]  an important message
[4593.66 --> 4595.62]  when he was headed
[4595.62 --> 4596.54]  to do one thing
[4596.54 --> 4598.30]  and was convinced
[4598.30 --> 4599.70]  through wisdom
[4599.70 --> 4600.76]  of Abigail
[4600.76 --> 4602.44]  and God
[4602.44 --> 4603.06]  saving him
[4603.06 --> 4604.04]  to do something else
[4604.04 --> 4604.46]  and had
[4604.46 --> 4606.36]  an important thing
[4606.36 --> 4606.68]  to learn.
[4606.76 --> 4607.64]  We all have
[4607.64 --> 4609.28]  very important things
[4609.28 --> 4609.84]  that we still
[4609.84 --> 4610.52]  need to learn
[4610.52 --> 4611.90]  and this is a song
[4611.90 --> 4612.48]  that I chose
[4612.48 --> 4613.48]  to follow
[4613.48 --> 4615.50]  up the sermon
[4615.50 --> 4616.00]  today
[4616.00 --> 4617.26]  that simply says
[4617.26 --> 4618.56]  teach me your way
[4618.56 --> 4619.66]  O Lord
[4619.66 --> 4621.56]  and we express
[4621.56 --> 4622.06]  to God
[4622.06 --> 4623.08]  in humility
[4623.08 --> 4624.40]  our need
[4624.40 --> 4625.74]  for instruction
[4625.74 --> 4626.28]  and teaching.
[4626.84 --> 4627.46]  We're going to
[4627.46 --> 4629.04]  sing the first verse
[4629.04 --> 4630.92]  if you know the hymn
[4630.92 --> 4632.10]  it may be familiar
[4632.10 --> 4632.60]  to you
[4632.60 --> 4633.58]  very singable
[4633.58 --> 4635.06]  you can join along
[4635.06 --> 4635.58]  but we will
[4635.58 --> 4636.84]  repeat the first verse
[4636.84 --> 4638.82]  after you've had a chance.
[4639.20 --> 4639.90]  Stand to sing.
[4639.90 --> 4662.66]  teach me your way
[4662.66 --> 4663.58]  O Lord
[4663.58 --> 4666.74]  teach me your way
[4666.74 --> 4670.68]  your guiding grace
[4670.68 --> 4671.36]  afford
[4671.36 --> 4674.86]  teach me your way
[4674.86 --> 4678.58]  I need you walk
[4678.58 --> 4679.56]  the right
[4679.56 --> 4681.56]  for my faith
[4681.56 --> 4683.72]  last my sight
[4683.72 --> 4685.80]  lead me with
[4685.80 --> 4687.66]  every love
[4687.66 --> 4690.48]  teach me your way
[4690.48 --> 4695.10]  teach me your way
[4695.10 --> 4696.22]  your way
[4696.22 --> 4699.58]  teach me your way
[4699.58 --> 4701.54]  your guide
[4701.54 --> 4702.84]  your guiding grace
[4702.84 --> 4703.58]  so far
[4703.58 --> 4707.36]  teach me your way
[4707.36 --> 4710.80]  help me to walk
[4710.80 --> 4711.68]  the right
[4711.68 --> 4713.84]  for my faith
[4713.84 --> 4716.02]  last my sight
[4716.02 --> 4718.16]  lead me with
[4718.16 --> 4723.44]  Every night, teach me your way.
[4725.34 --> 4732.60]  When I am sad and far, teach me your way.
[4732.60 --> 4740.60]  When earthly joys depart, teach me your way.
[4740.60 --> 4756.96]  In arms of loneliness, in times of dire distress, in failure or success, teach me your way.
[4760.96 --> 4769.74]  When doubts and fears arise, teach me your way.
[4769.74 --> 4777.38]  When storms of loneliness, teach me your way.
[4778.18 --> 4785.98]  Shine through the cloud and blaze, through sorrow and toil and pain.
[4785.98 --> 4793.88]  In thou my path, quickly teach me your way.
[4793.88 --> 4806.52]  Long as my life shall last, teach me your way.
[4806.52 --> 4814.70]  Where earth my love be cast, teach me your way.
[4814.70 --> 4831.28]  Until the race is run, until the journey's gone, until the promise won, teach me your way.
[4831.28 --> 4850.04]  I want to thank Gary for opening that passage to us with his passion.
[4850.04 --> 4853.52]  Gary is an Old Testament scholar.
[4854.42 --> 4860.46]  It really comes through his knowledge of the text and also the way he brought it out with the gospel.
[4861.74 --> 4867.34]  We now have an opportunity to respond in gratitude.
[4867.34 --> 4875.50]  And we show gratitude to the Lord through living lives according to his ways, as we say, living lives of gratitude.
[4875.94 --> 4883.90]  And using our talents, our treasures, and our time for his service in the spread of his kingdom.
[4884.74 --> 4891.26]  So now as we give our offerings to the Lord, it's an opportunity for Christians to give back to him.
[4891.26 --> 4899.04]  And our designated offering for today is for North American Indigenous Ministries and for the Johnson families,
[4899.46 --> 4904.74]  both, as you see there, Howard and Jenny and Tim and Charity.
[4904.80 --> 4910.88]  I've never actually met them, but I know we've supported them for many years in their ministry up in northern B.C.
[4911.28 --> 4914.74]  So may I invite the deacons to come forward and collect our offering.
[4921.26 --> 4951.24]  Thank you.
[4951.26 --> 4981.24]  Thank you.
[4981.26 --> 4983.26]  Thank you.

[5164.26 --> 5165.26]  Amen.
[5165.26 --> 5166.26]  Amen.
[5166.26 --> 5167.26]  Amen.
[5167.26 --> 5168.26]  Amen.
[5168.26 --> 5171.26]  Thank you for that beautiful music.
[5171.26 --> 5172.26]  Praise be to God.
[5172.26 --> 5179.26]  Let's go ahead and join together now and turn our hearts to the Lord in prayer.
[5179.26 --> 5184.26]  There are many things that we need to pray for in our world, in our congregation.
[5184.26 --> 5188.26]  So let's go to the Lord in prayer together.
[5188.26 --> 5196.26]  Our gracious God and Father, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
[5196.26 --> 5205.26]  Before the mountains were brought forth or ever you formed the earth and the world from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[5205.26 --> 5211.26]  We come to you, ancient of days, with expectant hearts as your people.
[5211.26 --> 5219.26]  We come rejoicing in our identity in Christ Jesus, your eternal begotten Son, our Savior.
[5219.26 --> 5227.26]  And as he came in humility, long ago, may he soon come again in glory.
[5227.26 --> 5230.26]  May he return soon to make all things new.
[5230.26 --> 5232.26]  Father, you are a God of hope.
[5232.26 --> 5238.26]  Open our hearts this morning and give to us, Lord, hearts that wait expectantly.
[5238.26 --> 5243.26]  And hearts that wait patiently for you to act.
[5243.26 --> 5248.26]  Hearts that wait with faith and hope and love.
[5248.26 --> 5251.26]  And as we wait, Lord, help us.
[5251.26 --> 5256.26]  Lord, we pray this morning for the people of Iran.
[5256.26 --> 5262.26]  God of the nations, we pray for peace and protection for all those who are victims of war.
[5262.26 --> 5265.26]  Lord, please keep the innocent in safety.
[5265.26 --> 5272.26]  We pray especially, Lord, for the Bahid and Benez, for Abbas and Violet, Mustafa and Fawel,
[5272.26 --> 5276.26]  who have family and relatives and friends who are still living in Iran.
[5276.26 --> 5278.26]  Lord, would you keep them safe?
[5278.26 --> 5286.26]  We pray, Lord, for world leaders who are involved in bringing resolution and an end of hostilities.
[5286.26 --> 5291.26]  Father, would you grant these leaders your wisdom, your justice and your mercy.
[5291.26 --> 5296.26]  Lord, would they not be fools, but, Lord, act in righteousness.
[5296.26 --> 5301.26]  Lord, would you keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of those who would seek to use them to do evil.
[5304.26 --> 5314.26]  And Father, we also pray to you as the creator and sustainer of all life and all cultures and all relationships.
[5314.26 --> 5319.26]  And today, we lift up to you the indigenous peoples in Canada.
[5319.26 --> 5323.26]  Lord, we pray for indigenous communities and families.
[5323.26 --> 5331.26]  We pray that you would strengthen and protect and guide, provide for and encourage First Nations and Métis and Inuit communities.
[5331.26 --> 5338.26]  Lord, whether they are living in cities, whether they're living in rural towns or on reserves.
[5338.26 --> 5354.26]  Lord, we pray for healing for individuals and families, generations and communities, Lord, that are still experiencing and struggling with the impacts of the residential school system and the broader impacts of colonialism.
[5354.26 --> 5357.26]  And Lord, we pray for healing for life and the more you are living in people and the more you are living in our lives.
[5357.26 --> 5359.26]  We pray for healing for the children and the more you are living in the world.
[5359.26 --> 5367.26]  And Lord, we confess a hard truth that we, your church in Canada, was complicit in the destruction, not only of indigenous cultures and communities, but of families as well.
[5367.26 --> 5373.80]  Lord, on behalf of the church, we ask for forgiveness for the physical, emotional,
[5373.80 --> 5379.44]  sexual, and spiritual harm that was inflicted in your name. Father, we pray
[5379.44 --> 5386.50]  that indigenous peoples in this land would have equitable access to education,
[5386.50 --> 5393.06]  to housing, to clean drinking water, job opportunities. We ask that you would give
[5393.06 --> 5399.42]  wisdom and insight to indigenous leaders of their nations and communities and also
[5399.42 --> 5405.26]  Lord, to younger generations who will lead these communities in the future.
[5405.78 --> 5412.68]  Father, we thank you for Gary and his ministry of word and deed amongst
[5412.68 --> 5418.14]  seafarers. Lord, who come from all over the world and who exist on the margins and
[5418.14 --> 5425.40]  who are often unseen. Lord, as this is the year where there's consideration given to
[5425.40 --> 5431.10]  the the problem of harassment, Lord, we pray that ships would be places that are
[5431.10 --> 5436.28]  safe, work environments for all the sailors that they would not there would not be
[5436.28 --> 5443.28]  harassment and people like Naval who are doing evil things on board. Lord, we pray
[5443.28 --> 5447.12]  that your gospel would spread amongst seafarers and that you would use them in
[5447.12 --> 5453.26]  turn to take your gospel to the nations. Lord, would you grant Gary success in his
[5453.26 --> 5458.24]  ministry that you have given him to do for your glory and the expansion of your
[5458.24 --> 5466.16]  church in the world. Lord, we also thank you for the work of Synod 2025, which
[5466.16 --> 5472.78]  concluded just a few days ago. Lord, we thank you that you are still working, not only in
[5472.78 --> 5478.92]  this world as we know you are, but also in our little place in your great kingdom, in
[5478.92 --> 5484.96]  the Christian Reformed Church. Lord, we thank you for this denomination. We thank you for
[5484.96 --> 5492.84]  each and every church who labors alongside us in gospel hope. And Lord, we pray for
[5492.84 --> 5498.78]  those in our community here at Laner CRC who have needs. Lord, we ask for your comfort and peace
[5498.78 --> 5509.04]  for Henny who is in the hospital undergoing great some pain and discomfort. We pray for Art who is in
[5509.04 --> 5520.66]  hospice. Excuse me. And Lord, would you provide the peace that surpasses understanding in these very
[5520.66 --> 5526.78]  difficult times? Thank you, Lord, that you are always with us, whether in the hospital or in hospice.
[5528.04 --> 5532.66]  And we pray also this morning, especially for George Kulin, who had to return to the hospital
[5532.66 --> 5539.86]  after a surgery. Lord, we pray for healing for George. We pray for strength and perseverance for
[5539.86 --> 5546.26]  him and for his wife, Carrie, as they continue to travel this difficult road together. Lord, would you bring
[5546.26 --> 5555.62]  him to quick recovery and preserve him, Lord? And Lord, we pray for your healing over those things
[5555.62 --> 5560.72]  that are spoken and those things that remain unspoken, for those that are known to some of us
[5560.72 --> 5567.94]  and for some of those things that are known only to you, O Lord. We pray all these things in the name
[5567.94 --> 5571.40]  of Jesus. We pray in the way that he taught us to pray, saying together,
[5571.40 --> 5580.14]  our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is
[5580.14 --> 5586.84]  in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[5587.34 --> 5594.10]  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power
[5594.10 --> 5603.78]  and the glory forever. Amen. Let's all stand. And I invite you to join us for a time of fellowship
[5603.78 --> 5610.28]  and coffee through the halls there into the other room. And it's a great time to catch up with each
[5610.28 --> 5616.40]  other, greet one another, get to know one another better. And we go out with the Lord's word of
[5616.40 --> 5622.32]  blessing upon us, his people. I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving his blessing.
[5623.54 --> 5628.88]  The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5629.18 --> 5633.44]  The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.
[5634.34 --> 5637.00]  Let's remain standing and we'll sing our final song.
[5637.00 --> 5638.00]  Amen.
[5646.40 --> 5647.34] igos...
[5650.72 --> 5651.90]  Yep.
[5656.64 --> 5657.18]  Amen.
[5659.18 --> 5660.14]  Amen.
[5670.18 --> 5671.18]  Amen.
[5671.18 --> 5674.18]  Gente
[5674.18 --> 5678.98]  May your heart be the divine.
[5679.48 --> 5683.74]  All your sin in heaven's hell.
[5684.18 --> 5687.90]  Come to earth, free of despair.
[5690.12 --> 5694.18]  Let the people praise you, Lord.
[5694.80 --> 5698.80]  You lie on and live alone.
[5698.80 --> 5703.56]  Let the nations shout and sing.
[5703.56 --> 5708.02]  Glory to the gracious Lord.
[5708.60 --> 5712.94]  And don't be the truly pain.
[5713.14 --> 5717.44]  And your holy will obey.
[5719.54 --> 5724.06]  Let the people praise you, Lord.
[5724.06 --> 5728.90]  You shall be in His hands of God.
[5728.90 --> 5733.36]  Unto us your blessings be.
[5733.36 --> 5738.28]  We to your people tell Him.
[5738.28 --> 5742.74]  O me, O my God, O my God.
[5742.74 --> 5748.66]  Lord, eternal life and love.
[5748.66 --> 5754.04]  O me, O my God.
[5754.04 --> 5758.04]  O me, O my God.
[5758.04 --> 5765.42]  O me, O my God.
[5765.42 --> 5767.42]  O me, O my God.
[5767.42 --> 5769.42]  O me, O my God.
[5769.42 --> 5771.58]  O me, O my God.
