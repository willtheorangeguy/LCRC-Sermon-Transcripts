[896.04 --> 901.64]  And rise on earth to touch your heart,
[901.64 --> 906.84]  And glorify your name.
[906.84 --> 912.84]  Your name is a strong and mighty power,
[912.84 --> 918.84]  Your name is a shelter like no other,
[918.84 --> 924.84]  Your name let the nations sing it louder,
[924.84 --> 930.44]  Cause nothing has the power to say,
[930.44 --> 934.44]  But your name.
[934.44 --> 942.04]  Jesus in your name we pray,
[942.04 --> 948.04]  Come and fill our hearts today,
[948.04 --> 953.64]  Who will give us rain to live for you,
[953.64 --> 959.24]  And glorify your name.
[959.24 --> 965.24]  Your name is a strong and mighty power,
[965.24 --> 971.24]  Your name is a shelter like no other,
[971.24 --> 976.84]  Your name is a shelter like no other,
[976.84 --> 981.98]  Cause nothing has the power to say
[981.98 --> 985.38]  But your name
[985.38 --> 991.10]  Your name
[991.10 --> 994.94]  Is a strong and mighty power
[994.94 --> 997.06]  Your name
[997.06 --> 1000.76]  Is a shelter, light, and honor
[1000.76 --> 1003.84]  Your name
[1003.84 --> 1006.60]  And the nations sing it louder
[1006.60 --> 1012.04]  Cause nothing has the power to say
[1012.04 --> 1015.20]  But your name
[1015.20 --> 1020.08]  You may be seated.
[1029.08 --> 1033.44]  Our first scripture reading this morning is from Psalm 63.
[1033.44 --> 1039.54]  If you'd like to open your pew Bible, that would be on page 429.
[1039.54 --> 1052.60]  Page 429
[1052.60 --> 1056.08]  We'll read Psalm 63.
[1056.08 --> 1059.38]  Oh God
[1059.38 --> 1063.56]  Oh wait, a Psalm of David when he was in the desert of Judah.
[1064.16 --> 1064.88]  Verse 1
[1064.88 --> 1067.76]  Oh God, you are my God
[1067.76 --> 1070.50]  Earnestly I seek you
[1070.50 --> 1072.74]  My soul thirsts for you
[1072.74 --> 1074.14]  My body longs for you
[1074.14 --> 1076.20]  In a dry and weary land
[1076.20 --> 1077.58]  Where there is no water
[1077.58 --> 1080.38]  I have seen you in the sanctuary
[1080.38 --> 1082.28]  And beheld your power
[1082.28 --> 1083.04]  And your glory
[1083.04 --> 1085.78]  Because your love is better than life
[1085.78 --> 1088.00]  My lips will glorify you
[1088.00 --> 1089.00]  I will praise you
[1089.00 --> 1089.58]  I will praise you
[1089.58 --> 1090.86]  As long as I live
[1090.86 --> 1091.94]  And in your name
[1091.94 --> 1093.78]  I will lift up my hands
[1093.78 --> 1096.30]  My soul will be satisfied
[1096.30 --> 1098.18]  As with the richest of foods
[1098.18 --> 1099.60]  With singing lips
[1099.60 --> 1101.40]  My mouth will praise you
[1101.40 --> 1104.16]  On my bed I remember you
[1104.16 --> 1105.56]  I think of you
[1105.56 --> 1106.96]  Through the watches of the night
[1106.96 --> 1109.22]  Because you are my help
[1109.22 --> 1111.82]  I sing in the shadow of your wings
[1111.82 --> 1113.80]  My soul clings to you
[1113.80 --> 1115.28]  Your right hand upholds me
[1115.28 --> 1118.16]  They who seek my life will be destroyed
[1118.16 --> 1120.58]  They will go down to the depths of the earth
[1120.58 --> 1122.72]  They will be given over to the sword
[1122.72 --> 1124.26]  And become food for jackals
[1124.26 --> 1126.72]  But the king will rejoice in God
[1126.72 --> 1130.02]  All who swear by God's name will praise him
[1130.02 --> 1133.18]  While the mouths of liars will be silenced
[1133.18 --> 1135.14]  This is the word of the Lord
[1135.14 --> 1140.00]  And so scripture
[1140.00 --> 1142.22]  The Bible encourages us
[1142.22 --> 1145.16]  To come to the throne of God
[1145.16 --> 1147.44]  Acknowledging our sin
[1147.44 --> 1149.12]  Not concealing our sin
[1149.12 --> 1150.84]  But confessing it
[1150.84 --> 1153.54]  With a humble and obedient heart
[1153.54 --> 1154.86]  So that we may then
[1154.86 --> 1156.64]  Before God receive his forgiveness
[1156.64 --> 1158.16]  And be restored
[1158.16 --> 1160.88]  Through his boundless grace and his mercy
[1160.88 --> 1162.62]  So would you please join me
[1162.62 --> 1164.62]  As I lead us in a prayer of confession
[1164.62 --> 1166.44]  And our prayer this morning
[1166.44 --> 1168.94]  Is in the words of Psalm 40
[1168.94 --> 1170.66]  So let's bow our heads
[1170.66 --> 1174.38]  Humbly and confess our sins to God
[1174.38 --> 1178.62]  Do not withhold your mercy from me Lord
[1178.62 --> 1181.32]  May your love and faithfulness
[1181.32 --> 1182.40]  Always protect me
[1182.40 --> 1186.06]  For troubles without number surround me
[1186.06 --> 1188.74]  My sins have overtaken me
[1188.74 --> 1190.46]  And I cannot see
[1190.46 --> 1193.46]  They are more than the hairs of my head
[1193.46 --> 1196.04]  And my heart fails within me
[1196.04 --> 1198.76]  Be pleased to save me Lord
[1198.76 --> 1200.64]  Come quickly Lord to help me
[1200.64 --> 1202.74]  May all who seek you
[1202.74 --> 1204.52]  Rejoice and be glad in you
[1204.52 --> 1207.46]  May those who long for your saving help
[1207.46 --> 1208.24]  Always say
[1208.24 --> 1209.66]  The Lord is great
[1209.66 --> 1211.74]  But as for me
[1211.74 --> 1214.10]  I am poor and needy
[1214.10 --> 1216.12]  May the Lord think of me
[1216.12 --> 1218.86]  You are my help and my deliverer
[1218.86 --> 1221.14]  You are my God
[1221.14 --> 1222.86]  Do not delay
[1222.86 --> 1226.94]  So let's take a moment
[1226.94 --> 1229.08]  And silently confess our own sins
[1229.08 --> 1230.12]  Please privately to the Lord
[1230.12 --> 1250.76]  Our Lord you are our helper
[1250.76 --> 1253.54]  We cling to your mercy and your grace
[1253.54 --> 1255.98]  Lord restore us unto yourself
[1255.98 --> 1259.02]  That we might love you
[1259.02 --> 1260.18]  And know your love
[1260.18 --> 1261.42]  That we might
[1261.42 --> 1263.18]  Know your faithfulness
[1263.18 --> 1265.20]  And respond in faithfulness
[1265.20 --> 1266.70]  In the way we live
[1266.70 --> 1268.06]  To you Lord
[1268.06 --> 1269.82]  Would you help us by your spirit
[1269.82 --> 1273.24]  To enjoy the life that you have given us
[1273.24 --> 1274.42]  And to live for your glory
[1274.42 --> 1275.54]  We pray in Christ's name
[1275.54 --> 1276.10]  Amen
[1276.10 --> 1278.06]  So brothers and sisters
[1278.06 --> 1280.10]  We have a God who has forgiven us
[1280.10 --> 1282.66]  Because of who Jesus Christ is
[1282.66 --> 1283.78]  And what he has done for us
[1283.78 --> 1284.42]  Through his death
[1284.42 --> 1285.48]  And his resurrection
[1285.48 --> 1287.68]  So hear these wonderful words
[1287.68 --> 1288.40]  Of assurance
[1288.40 --> 1290.54]  For Romans chapter 4
[1290.54 --> 1292.22]  Two verses
[1292.22 --> 1293.42]  25 to 5-1
[1293.42 --> 1296.70]  Jesus was delivered over to death
[1296.70 --> 1297.90]  For our sins
[1297.90 --> 1300.00]  And was raised to life
[1300.00 --> 1301.48]  For our justification
[1301.48 --> 1303.92]  Therefore since we have been justified
[1303.92 --> 1304.84]  Through faith
[1304.84 --> 1307.12]  We have peace with God
[1307.12 --> 1309.82]  Through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1309.82 --> 1312.14]  So praise be to God
[1312.14 --> 1313.28]  And with that let's stand
[1313.28 --> 1314.50]  And let's sing some more songs
[1314.50 --> 1315.14]  Of praise
[1315.14 --> 1316.54]  In response
[1316.54 --> 1317.24]  To who God is
[1317.24 --> 1318.14]  And what he has done for us
[1318.14 --> 1331.08]  O the deep deep love of Jesus
[1331.08 --> 1345.20]  O the deep deep love of Jesus
[1345.20 --> 1348.80]  Cast on measure
[1348.80 --> 1352.20]  Boundless free
[1352.20 --> 1354.20]  O the deep love of Jesus
[1354.20 --> 1359.20]  Oh, live as a mighty ocean
[1359.20 --> 1367.20]  In his fullness over me
[1367.20 --> 1371.20]  Underneath me
[1371.20 --> 1375.58]  All around me
[1375.58 --> 1382.58]  Is the chorus of thy love
[1382.58 --> 1383.02]  Is the chorus of thy love
[1383.02 --> 1386.96]  Leaning on earth
[1386.96 --> 1390.76]  Leaning on earth
[1390.76 --> 1396.58]  To thy glorious Christ upon
[1396.58 --> 1398.58]  O the deep deep love of Jesus
[1398.58 --> 1402.58]  Spread his grace
[1402.58 --> 1409.58]  O the deep deep love of Jesus
[1409.58 --> 1410.58]  Spread his grace
[1410.58 --> 1414.58]  Spread his grace
[1414.58 --> 1418.58]  For true to show
[1418.58 --> 1420.58]  How he loved us
[1420.58 --> 1423.62]  How he loved us
[1423.62 --> 1427.50]  Never loved us
[1427.50 --> 1434.58]  Changes never, never more
[1434.58 --> 1438.58]  How he roaches
[1438.58 --> 1443.00]  Old with love once
[1443.00 --> 1450.48]  God to call them all his joy
[1450.48 --> 1458.54]  Love for their peace interceding
[1458.54 --> 1466.04]  God to call them from their shore
[1466.04 --> 1480.20]  O earth deep, deep love of Jesus
[1480.20 --> 1488.36]  Love of every love of us
[1488.36 --> 1496.10]  Tis an ocean, frost of blessing
[1496.10 --> 1504.20]  Tis a hail, a sweet o'er presence
[1504.20 --> 1511.80]  O earth deep, deep love of Jesus
[1511.80 --> 1520.08]  Tis an ocean, a fair to me
[1520.08 --> 1527.98]  And it lifts me up to glory
[1527.98 --> 1536.02]  For it lifts me up to thee
[1536.02 --> 1560.98]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains
[1560.98 --> 1564.98]  Where does my help now come from?
[1566.70 --> 1569.88]  My help comes from you
[1569.88 --> 1576.98]  Maker of heaven, creator of the air
[1576.98 --> 1581.98]  Oh, how I need you, Lord
[1581.98 --> 1585.26]  You are my only love
[1585.26 --> 1590.98]  Your one, only prayer
[1590.98 --> 1594.04]  So I will wait for you
[1594.04 --> 1597.36]  To come and rescue me
[1597.36 --> 1602.40]  Come and give me life
[1602.40 --> 1606.60]  I lift my eyes up
[1606.60 --> 1609.60]  To the mountains
[1609.60 --> 1614.38]  Where does my help now come from?

[1618.80 --> 1626.74]  Maker of heaven, creator of the air
[1626.74 --> 1630.94]  Oh, how I need you, Lord
[1630.94 --> 1634.26]  You are my only love
[1634.26 --> 1637.70]  You're my only prayer
[1637.70 --> 1643.42]  So I will wait for you
[1643.42 --> 1643.48]  So I will wait for you
[1643.48 --> 1646.48]  To come and rescue me
[1646.48 --> 1650.48]  Come and give me life
[1650.48 --> 1655.54]  I lift my eyes up
[1655.54 --> 1658.86]  To the mountains
[1658.86 --> 1663.70]  Where does my help now come from?
[1663.70 --> 1664.64]  Where does my help come from?
[1664.64 --> 1668.52]  My help comes from you
[1668.52 --> 1677.64]  Maker of heaven, creator of the air
[1677.64 --> 1681.10]  Thank you, baby, see you
[1681.10 --> 1691.34]  Yeah, well
[1691.34 --> 1693.78]  The kids and their teachers
[1693.78 --> 1695.02]  Are dismissed their classes
[1695.02 --> 1697.70]  Yeah
[1697.70 --> 1698.66]  And as they go
[1698.66 --> 1699.66]  Let's lift them up in prayer
[1699.66 --> 1701.94]  Lord, would you bless these children
[1701.94 --> 1702.74]  Whom you love
[1702.74 --> 1704.32]  As they discover
[1704.32 --> 1706.02]  In their own language
[1706.02 --> 1706.76]  Who you are
[1706.76 --> 1707.98]  And Lord, would you give them
[1707.98 --> 1708.96]  A sense of being known
[1708.96 --> 1709.76]  And loved by you
[1709.76 --> 1710.60]  Be with the teachers
[1710.60 --> 1712.72]  And be present
[1712.72 --> 1713.72]  In their every word
[1713.72 --> 1714.48]  And interaction
[1714.48 --> 1716.06]  Lord, for your sake
[1716.06 --> 1716.48]  Amen
[1716.48 --> 1723.98]  So we here
[1723.98 --> 1725.36]  Are in Romans
[1725.36 --> 1727.02]  Chapter 6
[1727.02 --> 1728.58]  And we're going to pick up
[1728.58 --> 1730.08]  Where we left off last time
[1730.08 --> 1731.98]  Reading Romans
[1731.98 --> 1732.68]  Chapter 6
[1732.68 --> 1733.32]  Verses
[1733.32 --> 1736.00]  6 to 14
[1736.00 --> 1738.16]  And
[1738.16 --> 1739.72]  That is on page 840
[1739.72 --> 1740.84]  Of your pew Bible
[1740.84 --> 1742.24]  If you'd like to open it
[1742.24 --> 1743.26]  Or you may follow along
[1743.26 --> 1743.84]  On the screen
[1743.84 --> 1750.20]  So page 840
[1750.20 --> 1751.68]  And we are in Romans
[1751.68 --> 1752.56]  Chapter 6
[1752.56 --> 1754.80]  And I'll begin reading
[1754.80 --> 1755.68]  In verse 6
[1755.68 --> 1760.62]  For we know
[1760.62 --> 1762.18]  That our old self
[1762.18 --> 1763.08]  Was crucified
[1763.08 --> 1763.94]  With him
[1763.94 --> 1765.20]  So that
[1765.20 --> 1766.12]  The body of sin
[1766.12 --> 1767.22]  Might be done away with
[1767.22 --> 1768.76]  That we should no longer
[1768.76 --> 1769.86]  Be slaves to sin
[1769.86 --> 1771.14]  Because anyone
[1771.14 --> 1772.08]  Who has died
[1772.08 --> 1773.38]  Has been freed
[1773.38 --> 1774.04]  From sin
[1774.04 --> 1776.30]  Now if we died
[1776.30 --> 1776.90]  With Christ
[1776.90 --> 1777.48]  We believe
[1777.48 --> 1778.28]  That we will also
[1778.28 --> 1778.92]  Live with him
[1778.92 --> 1780.48]  For we know
[1780.48 --> 1781.40]  That since Christ
[1781.40 --> 1782.60]  Was raised from the dead
[1782.60 --> 1783.78]  He cannot die again
[1783.78 --> 1785.04]  Death no longer
[1785.04 --> 1786.84]  Has mastery over him
[1786.84 --> 1788.34]  The death he died
[1788.34 --> 1789.46]  He died to sin
[1789.46 --> 1790.24]  Once for all
[1790.24 --> 1791.94]  But the life he lives
[1791.94 --> 1792.84]  He lives to God
[1792.84 --> 1794.64]  In the same way
[1794.64 --> 1796.22]  Count yourselves
[1796.22 --> 1797.74]  Dead to sin
[1797.74 --> 1799.74]  But alive to God
[1799.74 --> 1800.68]  In Christ Jesus
[1800.68 --> 1801.96]  Therefore
[1801.96 --> 1803.40]  Do not let sin
[1803.40 --> 1804.98]  Reign in your mortal body
[1804.98 --> 1806.48]  So that you obey
[1806.48 --> 1807.68]  Its evil desires
[1807.68 --> 1809.24]  Do not offer
[1809.24 --> 1810.56]  The parts of your body
[1810.56 --> 1811.18]  To sin
[1811.18 --> 1811.98]  As instruments
[1811.98 --> 1813.08]  Of wickedness
[1813.08 --> 1814.56]  But rather
[1814.56 --> 1815.98]  Offer yourselves
[1815.98 --> 1816.56]  To God
[1816.56 --> 1817.86]  As those
[1817.86 --> 1819.02]  Who have been brought
[1819.02 --> 1820.14]  From death to life
[1820.14 --> 1821.26]  And offer
[1821.26 --> 1822.54]  The parts of your body
[1822.54 --> 1823.54]  To him
[1823.54 --> 1824.58]  As instruments
[1824.58 --> 1825.32]  Of righteousness
[1825.32 --> 1826.66]  For sin
[1826.66 --> 1827.40]  Shall not be
[1827.40 --> 1827.92]  Your master
[1827.92 --> 1829.20]  Because you are not
[1829.20 --> 1829.82]  Under law
[1829.82 --> 1831.00]  But under grace
[1831.00 --> 1832.28]  This is the word
[1832.28 --> 1832.70]  Of the Lord
[1832.70 --> 1837.56]  One more time
[1837.56 --> 1839.10]  This is the word
[1839.10 --> 1839.64]  Of the Lord
[1839.64 --> 1841.80]  That's better
[1841.80 --> 1842.46]  Let's pray
[1842.46 --> 1845.60]  Heavenly Father
[1845.60 --> 1846.34]  We thank you
[1846.34 --> 1847.38]  For your word
[1847.38 --> 1848.62]  Which is absolutely
[1848.62 --> 1849.90]  True and given to us
[1849.90 --> 1850.84]  In your love for us
[1850.84 --> 1852.46]  We ask that as we
[1852.46 --> 1853.56]  Sit under your word
[1853.56 --> 1855.60]  May we allow it
[1855.60 --> 1856.58]  To permeate
[1856.58 --> 1857.58]  Our lives
[1857.58 --> 1859.56]  Letting your word
[1859.56 --> 1860.22]  By the power
[1860.22 --> 1860.82]  Of your spirit
[1860.82 --> 1861.80]  Work in us
[1861.80 --> 1863.36]  Shattering idols
[1863.36 --> 1864.38]  Killing sin
[1864.38 --> 1865.80]  And making us
[1865.80 --> 1866.54]  Alive to you
[1866.54 --> 1868.16]  And we pray Lord
[1868.16 --> 1868.90]  That you would help
[1868.90 --> 1869.68]  And enable us
[1869.68 --> 1870.50]  To be alive
[1870.50 --> 1871.28]  To you
[1871.28 --> 1872.00]  Even now
[1872.00 --> 1873.14]  As we listen
[1873.14 --> 1873.78]  To your word
[1873.78 --> 1876.80]  We pray in Jesus name
[1876.80 --> 1877.48]  Amen
[1877.48 --> 1881.62]  Have you ever
[1881.62 --> 1883.76]  Had a near death
[1883.76 --> 1884.42]  Experience
[1884.42 --> 1887.36]  Or
[1887.36 --> 1887.90]  Yeah
[1887.90 --> 1888.88]  Some people have
[1888.88 --> 1891.44]  It's not that uncommon
[1891.44 --> 1893.84]  Or maybe you know
[1893.84 --> 1894.34]  Of someone
[1894.34 --> 1895.22]  Who has had
[1895.22 --> 1895.86]  A near death
[1895.86 --> 1896.48]  Experience
[1896.48 --> 1898.84]  As I was thinking
[1898.84 --> 1899.32]  About that
[1899.32 --> 1900.46]  There are two people
[1900.46 --> 1902.60]  That readily come to mind
[1902.60 --> 1903.18]  Who I know
[1903.18 --> 1903.70]  And I'll just
[1903.70 --> 1904.76]  Share their stories
[1904.76 --> 1905.72]  Real briefly with you
[1905.72 --> 1907.02]  So the first is
[1907.02 --> 1910.60]  A guy from my home church
[1910.60 --> 1912.04]  That I grew up in
[1912.04 --> 1912.78]  Named Peter
[1912.78 --> 1913.82]  And Peter
[1913.82 --> 1915.22]  Was formerly
[1915.22 --> 1916.38]  The master mechanic
[1916.38 --> 1917.78]  For BMW motorcycles
[1917.78 --> 1919.10]  So he would be
[1919.10 --> 1920.26]  On the side of the racetrack
[1920.26 --> 1920.62]  Where they have
[1920.62 --> 1921.58]  These high speed
[1921.58 --> 1922.54]  Motorcycle races
[1922.54 --> 1924.48]  And he would be
[1924.48 --> 1925.08]  Their mechanic
[1925.08 --> 1926.18]  And he would teach
[1926.18 --> 1927.30]  Mechanic classes
[1927.30 --> 1928.38]  In a suit
[1928.38 --> 1930.90]  But he himself
[1930.90 --> 1932.40]  Was in a terrible
[1932.40 --> 1933.40]  Motorcycle accident
[1933.40 --> 1934.48]  He broke almost
[1934.48 --> 1935.62]  Every bone in his body
[1935.62 --> 1938.56]  And but God
[1938.56 --> 1940.04]  Brought him through that
[1940.04 --> 1941.12]  He became a Christian
[1941.12 --> 1942.00]  And in a sense
[1942.00 --> 1942.58]  He was given
[1942.58 --> 1943.52]  A whole new life
[1943.52 --> 1944.54]  A whole new lease
[1944.54 --> 1945.52]  On life
[1945.52 --> 1946.66]  And he was
[1946.66 --> 1948.06]  Became very different
[1948.06 --> 1949.02]  He became transformed
[1949.02 --> 1952.82]  Now another guy I know
[1952.82 --> 1953.78]  Who had a near death
[1953.78 --> 1954.26]  Experience
[1954.26 --> 1955.14]  His name is Edward
[1955.14 --> 1956.12]  And I knew him
[1956.12 --> 1956.78]  From my previous
[1956.78 --> 1957.50]  Church in Richmond
[1957.50 --> 1959.36]  So Edward had
[1959.36 --> 1960.18]  A heart condition
[1960.18 --> 1961.80]  That put him
[1961.80 --> 1962.38]  In the hospital
[1962.38 --> 1963.80]  And it was
[1963.80 --> 1964.60]  Serious enough
[1964.60 --> 1965.36]  Where he felt
[1965.36 --> 1966.26]  That perhaps
[1966.26 --> 1967.76]  He was facing death
[1967.76 --> 1968.96]  A high chance
[1968.96 --> 1970.40]  That it would kill him
[1970.40 --> 1972.14]  But God preserved
[1972.14 --> 1972.70]  His life
[1972.70 --> 1973.56]  And in following
[1973.56 --> 1974.56]  That experience
[1974.56 --> 1976.08]  It caused him
[1976.08 --> 1978.10]  To reprioritize
[1978.10 --> 1978.56]  His life
[1978.56 --> 1978.88]  And he would
[1978.88 --> 1979.50]  Talk about
[1979.50 --> 1981.50]  The three priorities
[1981.50 --> 1982.26]  Of faith
[1982.26 --> 1983.98]  And family
[1983.98 --> 1985.08]  And fellowship
[1985.08 --> 1987.24]  And he lived
[1987.24 --> 1988.00]  According to
[1988.00 --> 1988.86]  These values
[1988.86 --> 1989.40]  Now he had
[1989.40 --> 1990.00]  Like this new
[1990.00 --> 1991.32]  Lease on life
[1991.32 --> 1993.12]  Now I'm sharing
[1993.12 --> 1993.68]  These stories
[1993.68 --> 1994.52]  With you because
[1994.52 --> 1995.54]  That's sort of
[1995.54 --> 1996.02]  The idea
[1996.02 --> 1996.58]  Of the Christian
[1996.58 --> 1996.98]  Life
[1996.98 --> 1998.00]  Right
[1998.00 --> 1998.86]  Every one
[1998.86 --> 1999.62]  Of you here
[1999.62 --> 2000.22]  If you are
[2000.22 --> 2000.72]  A Christian
[2000.72 --> 2001.94]  Has had
[2001.94 --> 2002.64]  Not just
[2002.64 --> 2003.72]  A near death
[2003.72 --> 2004.24]  Experience
[2004.24 --> 2005.00]  But you have
[2005.00 --> 2005.94]  Actually had
[2005.94 --> 2007.20]  A death
[2007.20 --> 2007.90]  Experience
[2007.90 --> 2010.32]  That's what Paul
[2010.32 --> 2011.34]  Is driving at
[2011.34 --> 2012.16]  As he continues
[2012.16 --> 2013.20]  Here in verse 6
[2013.20 --> 2013.66]  He says
[2013.66 --> 2014.82]  Your old self
[2014.82 --> 2016.30]  Has been
[2016.30 --> 2017.22]  Crucified
[2017.22 --> 2018.04]  With Christ
[2018.04 --> 2021.58]  Think about that
[2021.58 --> 2022.48]  Right
[2022.48 --> 2023.32]  We don't often
[2023.32 --> 2025.02]  Understand
[2025.02 --> 2025.64]  Ourselves
[2025.64 --> 2026.24]  In that way
[2026.24 --> 2027.08]  But the reality
[2027.08 --> 2027.68]  Is
[2027.68 --> 2029.12]  I have
[2029.12 --> 2030.40]  Died
[2030.40 --> 2033.20]  Now most people
[2033.20 --> 2033.66]  In the world
[2033.66 --> 2034.50]  Do not consider
[2034.50 --> 2035.50]  Themselves as
[2035.50 --> 2036.26]  Having died
[2036.26 --> 2037.12]  Right
[2037.12 --> 2037.90]  They are breathing
[2037.90 --> 2038.66]  They are living
[2038.66 --> 2040.38]  And they know
[2040.38 --> 2041.06]  That one day
[2041.06 --> 2041.88]  Yes they will
[2041.88 --> 2042.12]  Die
[2042.12 --> 2042.56]  Hopefully
[2042.56 --> 2043.28]  One day
[2043.28 --> 2044.22]  Far in the
[2044.22 --> 2044.58]  Future
[2044.58 --> 2046.30]  But a Christian
[2046.30 --> 2046.92]  Says
[2046.92 --> 2048.24]  Nope
[2048.24 --> 2049.32]  I have
[2049.32 --> 2049.84]  Already
[2049.84 --> 2050.36]  Died
[2050.36 --> 2052.12]  And if you
[2052.12 --> 2052.80]  Were to say
[2052.80 --> 2053.46]  Out loud
[2053.46 --> 2054.12]  To somebody
[2054.12 --> 2054.88]  Like oh yeah
[2054.88 --> 2055.38]  I've had
[2055.38 --> 2055.96]  My funeral
[2055.96 --> 2058.04]  What would
[2058.04 --> 2058.42]  They think
[2058.42 --> 2058.80]  Of you
[2058.80 --> 2060.68]  They would
[2060.68 --> 2061.12]  Think that
[2061.12 --> 2061.48]  You are
[2061.48 --> 2061.88]  A raving
[2061.88 --> 2062.28]  Lunatic
[2062.28 --> 2064.42]  But that
[2064.42 --> 2065.08]  Is precisely
[2065.08 --> 2065.52]  What Paul
[2065.52 --> 2066.00]  Is saying
[2066.00 --> 2067.14]  That you
[2067.14 --> 2067.66]  Have
[2067.66 --> 2068.32]  Died
[2068.32 --> 2069.52]  Listen to
[2069.52 --> 2069.88]  What Paul
[2069.88 --> 2070.32]  Says in
[2070.32 --> 2070.92]  Galatians
[2070.92 --> 2072.50]  Chapter 2
[2072.50 --> 2073.00]  Verse 20
[2073.00 --> 2073.66]  Perhaps one
[2073.66 --> 2073.94]  Of my
[2073.94 --> 2074.28]  Favorite
[2074.28 --> 2074.64]  Verses
[2074.64 --> 2074.82]  In the
[2074.82 --> 2074.94]  Whole
[2074.94 --> 2075.22]  Bible
[2075.22 --> 2076.44]  I have
[2076.44 --> 2076.60]  Been
[2076.60 --> 2077.18]  Crucified
[2077.18 --> 2077.44]  With
[2077.44 --> 2077.92]  Christ
[2077.92 --> 2078.44]  I
[2078.44 --> 2078.66]  No
[2078.66 --> 2079.10]  Longer
[2079.10 --> 2079.44]  Live
[2079.44 --> 2079.66]  But
[2079.66 --> 2080.02]  Christ
[2080.02 --> 2080.28]  Lives
[2080.28 --> 2080.48]  In
[2080.48 --> 2080.70]  Me
[2080.70 --> 2081.34]  The
[2081.34 --> 2081.56]  Life
[2081.56 --> 2081.68]  I
[2081.68 --> 2081.98]  Now
[2081.98 --> 2082.40]  Live
[2082.40 --> 2082.56]  In
[2082.56 --> 2082.70]  The
[2082.70 --> 2083.04]  Body
[2083.04 --> 2083.24]  I
[2083.24 --> 2083.46]  Live
[2083.46 --> 2083.64]  By
[2083.64 --> 2084.14]  Faith
[2084.14 --> 2084.32]  In
[2084.32 --> 2084.42]  The
[2084.42 --> 2084.56]  Son
[2084.56 --> 2084.72]  Of
[2084.72 --> 2085.06]  God
[2085.06 --> 2085.72]  Who
[2085.72 --> 2086.16]  Loved
[2086.16 --> 2086.46]  Me
[2086.46 --> 2087.16]  And
[2087.16 --> 2087.28]  Who
[2087.28 --> 2087.58]  Gave
[2087.58 --> 2087.86]  Himself
[2087.86 --> 2088.20]  For
[2088.20 --> 2088.44]  Me

[2237.48 --> 2238.20]  As
[2238.20 --> 2238.62]  A
[2238.62 --> 2239.94]  Ruler
[2239.94 --> 2241.46]  Reign
[2241.46 --> 2241.78]  In
[2241.78 --> 2242.10]  God's
[2242.10 --> 2242.44]  World
[2242.44 --> 2244.50]  Well
[2244.50 --> 2244.80]  Paul
[2244.80 --> 2244.92]  Has
[2244.92 --> 2245.18]  Already
[2245.18 --> 2245.46]  Told
[2245.46 --> 2245.74]  Us
[2245.74 --> 2246.16]  In
[2246.16 --> 2246.58]  Chapter
[2246.58 --> 2246.98]  Five
[2246.98 --> 2247.16]  If
[2247.16 --> 2247.28]  You
[2247.28 --> 2247.42]  Were
[2247.42 --> 2247.68]  With
[2247.68 --> 2247.84]  Us
[2247.84 --> 2248.14]  Then
[2248.14 --> 2249.00]  That
[2249.00 --> 2249.44]  Sin
[2249.44 --> 2249.82]  Came
[2249.82 --> 2250.04]  Into
[2250.04 --> 2250.24]  The
[2250.24 --> 2250.54]  World
[2250.54 --> 2250.90]  Through
[2250.90 --> 2251.36]  Adam
[2251.36 --> 2252.34]  Right
[2252.34 --> 2252.48]  So
[2252.48 --> 2252.68]  Think
[2252.68 --> 2252.90]  About
[2252.90 --> 2253.20]  Adam
[2253.20 --> 2253.36]  And
[2253.36 --> 2253.52]  Eve
[2253.52 --> 2253.64]  In
[2253.64 --> 2253.74]  The
[2253.74 --> 2254.04]  Garden
[2254.04 --> 2255.14]  Right
[2255.14 --> 2255.36]  In
[2255.36 --> 2255.54]  Their
[2255.54 --> 2256.14]  State
[2256.14 --> 2257.04]  In
[2257.04 --> 2257.20]  Which
[2257.20 --> 2257.32]  They
[2257.32 --> 2257.46]  Were
[2257.46 --> 2257.86]  Created
[2257.86 --> 2258.28]  Before
[2258.28 --> 2258.52]  The
[2258.52 --> 2258.88]  Fallen
[2258.88 --> 2259.02]  To
[2259.02 --> 2259.36]  Sin
[2259.98 --> 2260.34]  They
[2260.34 --> 2260.36]  Had
[2260.36 --> 2260.54]  The
[2260.54 --> 2261.26]  Opportunity
[2261.26 --> 2261.52]  And
[2261.52 --> 2261.62]  The
[2261.62 --> 2262.10]  Ability
[2262.10 --> 2263.38]  To
[2263.38 --> 2263.84]  Sin
[2263.84 --> 2264.88]  Or
[2264.88 --> 2265.12]  To
[2265.12 --> 2265.50]  Not
[2265.50 --> 2266.04]  Sin
[2266.04 --> 2267.72]  Right
[2267.72 --> 2267.90]  They
[2267.90 --> 2268.14]  Could
[2268.14 --> 2268.70]  Continue
[2268.70 --> 2268.96]  In
[2268.96 --> 2269.10]  Their
[2269.10 --> 2269.52]  Perfect
[2269.52 --> 2270.08]  State
[2270.08 --> 2270.26]  In
[2270.26 --> 2270.42]  Which
[2270.42 --> 2270.62]  They
[2270.62 --> 2270.78]  Were
[2270.78 --> 2271.32]  Created
[2271.32 --> 2272.12]  Enjoying
[2272.12 --> 2272.56]  Fellowship
[2272.56 --> 2279.16]  with God, listening to the voice of God, or they could disobey God, eat from the fruit of the tree,
[2279.30 --> 2286.66]  which is what they did. And once they had disobeyed, they, along with all of us, all human beings,
[2286.66 --> 2293.34]  we have ended up now enslaved to sin, right? Something has changed in us so that apart from
[2293.34 --> 2302.32]  Christ, we only have a certain kind of freedom. We only have the freedom now to sin. And so we live
[2302.32 --> 2311.10]  under sin's reign, right? We are predisposed in our bodies, our minds, our hearts, our souls to want
[2311.10 --> 2317.86]  to sin. Paul here calls it being enslaved to sin. It's a state that we are all born into in Adam.
[2318.52 --> 2326.54]  And Paul says then that this was you, this was me, this was all of us under sin. But then what happens?
[2326.54 --> 2336.14]  Look at verse 7. Paul continues, because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
[2336.98 --> 2345.24]  Okay, so there was this old you under the influence of Adam. You were enslaved to sin, but now Christ has
[2345.24 --> 2353.92]  come and he saved you. He transferred you from the realm, the sphere of Adam, to Christ so that you no
[2353.92 --> 2362.44]  longer live under sin's tyranny. But you now belong to Christ. You live under his influence, his lordship.
[2362.74 --> 2368.30]  He is now your new Lord. And it's this kind of a neat picture that Christians, in some ways,
[2368.60 --> 2376.68]  we are actually restored to an Adam and Eve-like existence where we now have the ability in Christ
[2376.68 --> 2385.06]  to sin or to not sin. Right? We lost that ability because of Adam in the fall, but in Christ we
[2385.06 --> 2393.68]  regained the ability to not sin. It means that sin is not completely irresistible to us anymore. We can
[2393.68 --> 2401.30]  actually see sin for what it is. It no longer rules over us. It no longer enslaves us. Now, is it still
[2401.30 --> 2412.38]  powerful? Yes. Is it still tempting? Yes. Of course. But the fundamental ruler of a Christian's life has
[2412.38 --> 2419.10]  changed. You are no longer under the rule of sin. You are now under the rule of Christ. So let me give
[2419.10 --> 2430.14]  you an illustration. Imagine a kingdom ruled by a bad evil king. Right? And this evil king is exploiting
[2430.14 --> 2436.16]  and harming the citizens of that kingdom, oppressing them, treating them terribly. And the citizens of
[2436.16 --> 2441.70]  this kingdom, they are powerless to change their situation. They are powerless to go free. But one
[2441.70 --> 2448.78]  day, a noble and good king comes from a far-off country, and he comes, and he invades with his army,
[2449.02 --> 2456.96]  and the good king takes over the kingdom. He throws out that old evil king. He puts new laws into place,
[2456.96 --> 2462.56]  and the whole society is kind of turned upside down. Everything is new. The people are free.
[2463.22 --> 2470.22]  They now live under the lordship of a new king, a good king who loves his people.
[2471.66 --> 2478.42]  That's the picture that Paul is painting for us here. Right? When Jesus comes, he preaches the kingdom
[2478.42 --> 2487.10]  of God. A new kingdom has come. And Christ has come to destroy sin and death, to smash this ruler,
[2487.10 --> 2494.90]  and to liberate all of us as captives when we acknowledge him as king. And Jesus says,
[2495.12 --> 2502.80]  if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed. And so the gospel, friends, not only cancels
[2502.80 --> 2509.38]  the record of sin in a legal sense, right? Freeing us from the penalty of sin, it also frees us from
[2509.38 --> 2517.54]  the power of sin. Okay, we're not only forgiven, we're also set free. So that's the first implication
[2517.54 --> 2523.16]  of being united in Christ, that we have a new lord. Now the second thing is that we have a new life.
[2523.16 --> 2531.70]  Okay, so if you indeed are in this new kingdom ruled by Jesus Christ, and if you now have this
[2531.70 --> 2538.10]  profound freedom that you didn't have before, what does that look like in your life? What does that
[2538.10 --> 2545.96]  begin to look like? Well, verse 8 kind of bridges these two ideas. It says this, now if we died with
[2545.96 --> 2552.30]  Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. Okay, so the Christian life is not only about
[2552.30 --> 2560.00]  a death, but it's also about a new kind of life. So Paul is telling us here
[2560.00 --> 2569.08]  what I just said. So now let me tell you this wonderful story that it's about St. Augustine.
[2569.14 --> 2575.72]  It's kind of a famous story. I may have used it before, I can't remember. But so St. Augustine was a
[2575.72 --> 2583.46]  bishop, a pastor, a theologian, and before he converted to Christianity, he lived a very promiscuous
[2583.46 --> 2590.98]  life. He had a girlfriend or a mistress in many cities that he had visited as a famous teacher of
[2590.98 --> 2598.30]  rhetoric in the Roman world. Well, one day long after he had converted to Christianity, he happened
[2598.30 --> 2607.86]  to be visiting a city where he once had a female friend. And so she recognized him. And she's excited,
[2608.02 --> 2614.68]  and she goes up to him and strikes up a conversation, fully expecting to resume their former relationship.
[2615.46 --> 2621.52]  And so they're talking, and then after a very short but polite conversation, Augustine walks away.
[2621.52 --> 2627.72]  And she's very confused, and she's wondering, like, what's going on here? And she thinks, well, you know,
[2627.74 --> 2633.64]  I haven't seen him in a long time. Maybe he doesn't recognize me. And so she calls out, Augustine,
[2633.88 --> 2642.80]  don't you know? It is I. And Augustine turns around, and he says, I know, but it is not I.
[2642.80 --> 2651.88]  See? And I love that story because that's the picture here. Okay, you have this old self, this
[2651.88 --> 2657.88]  former way of life. You've died with Christ. You've risen again. You have this new life, and now it is
[2657.88 --> 2666.62]  not I, but it is Christ who lives in me. You have a whole new life, a new identity. So that now through
[2666.62 --> 2673.66]  the Holy Spirit, you have this new heart, a new motivation to obey God, to live for him. And not
[2673.66 --> 2681.64]  out of fear of hell, not out of pride, like I'm better or more righteous with a sense of superiority,
[2681.64 --> 2687.12]  but out of humble gratitude for the one who loved you and gave himself for you.
[2687.12 --> 2697.18]  So we have this new life now also because Jesus has a new life. Okay, we are united to him, and because
[2697.18 --> 2704.56]  we, because he has a new life, we have a new life in him. So if you look at verse 10, this is what it
[2704.56 --> 2713.50]  says. Talking about Jesus, it says the death he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives,
[2713.50 --> 2720.14]  he lives to God. So Paul's saying the reason we now have a new life is because, verse 10, he died,
[2720.78 --> 2728.50]  and now he lives. Now this verse is sort of puzzling upon first glance, but here's what I think Paul
[2728.50 --> 2738.20]  means. He's saying that Christ, in his death on the cross, submitted himself to the reign of sin.
[2739.46 --> 2743.48]  That's one of the things that Christ was doing on the cross. He actually, you know, sin is the
[2743.48 --> 2754.56]  ruler. He submitted himself to sin, to the rule of sin, and on the cross he died, and he conquered sin.
[2754.70 --> 2761.32]  He conquered death through his resurrection, so that now he has passed from the sphere of sin
[2761.32 --> 2768.22]  to now the sphere of God. And so he died to sin once for all. He no longer lives under sin,
[2768.22 --> 2775.88]  because he's conquered it, and now he lives completely and fully forever, fully for the glory of God.
[2777.46 --> 2785.80]  And now here's the point. The same is true for us, okay? Because of what Christ has done,
[2786.34 --> 2793.56]  we now also are in the sphere where we now live fully forever for the glory of God.
[2793.56 --> 2800.26]  And one of the things this means, I think is really important, is that now Christ is doing stuff,
[2800.86 --> 2807.38]  okay? Because he lives to God, he is active in living for God right now.
[2807.38 --> 2815.12]  And so the New Testament, it talks about a risen and then ascended Christ. And Christ now,
[2815.50 --> 2822.06]  ascended at the right hand of God the Father, is not simply like skipping heavenly stones,
[2822.78 --> 2831.76]  passing the time, playing solitaire, waiting to come back. No, Jesus is active, right? Jesus is now
[2831.76 --> 2838.94]  ruling and reigning over creation. He's advocating for his people before the Father. He is at work in
[2838.94 --> 2845.50]  our lives individually and as a church by his Spirit, right? And so if we return to that kingdom
[2845.50 --> 2852.94]  metaphor, Jesus is on his throne as king, and he is actively ruling. That is what Jesus is doing right
[2852.94 --> 2860.98]  now. And in the same way, Paul argues, because you have been united to Christ, we also now live an active
[2860.98 --> 2869.70]  life for the glory of God. We are active participants in his kingdom, living a new way of life, new behavior,
[2869.98 --> 2875.34]  relating to our neighbors in new ways, lots of things, because we have been given a new life.
[2877.08 --> 2882.86]  Okay, so we've seen that being united to Christ means we now have a new Lord, we now have been given a
[2882.86 --> 2893.86]  new life. And then third and finally, it means we have a new lifestyle. Now here, Paul finally comes to
[2893.86 --> 2902.38]  the commands, okay? For six chapters, okay, we're in chapter six of Romans. We've been at this since
[2902.38 --> 2908.88]  last year, kind of going piece by piece or passage by passage. And Paul, what has been Paul doing? He's
[2908.88 --> 2916.50]  been telling us about the gospel. He's been writing about these great realities of the Christian life,
[2916.56 --> 2925.54]  about the nature of sin and justification. And not once, up until now, has he given us a command.
[2927.28 --> 2934.96]  Okay, that's remarkable. Not once in six chapters has Paul told us to do anything,
[2934.96 --> 2945.16]  other than to understand and to believe what he is writing. Now, finally, Paul tells us to actually
[2945.16 --> 2953.56]  do some things in response to all that he has been writing. So let's read verses 11 through 13,
[2954.08 --> 2957.06]  and we'll draw out a few things. So this is what he says.
[2957.06 --> 2965.38]  In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore,
[2965.82 --> 2974.16]  do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any part of
[2974.16 --> 2980.22]  yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have
[2980.22 --> 2986.94]  been brought from death to life. Offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
[2987.06 --> 2999.02]  So let me make three comments about these commands that we see here. So first is this. This is
[2999.02 --> 3009.38]  important, I think. That you can't separate ethics from theology. In other words, you can't separate
[3009.38 --> 3018.06]  how you are to live as a Christian from the truths of the gospel. And so sometimes people get irritated
[3018.06 --> 3024.40]  with all of this focus for the first five and a half chapters of Romans on the nature of sin
[3024.40 --> 3029.80]  and justification. And they're like, why do we need all of this theology? Why can't we just get practical?
[3029.80 --> 3038.46]  Just tell me what to do. But Paul knows that we're not going to be able to do, we're not going to be
[3038.46 --> 3045.82]  able to live the Christian life until we first are deeply rooted in the gospel. Deeply rooted in our
[3045.82 --> 3054.12]  understanding of our new life in Christ. And we do that, right, we become deeply rooted, Paul says,
[3054.12 --> 3061.38]  by counting ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. That's the first command we are given
[3061.38 --> 3074.38]  in Romans, to count, to reckon, to consider who you are. He says, of all this stuff I've said,
[3074.38 --> 3081.78]  consider yourselves in this way. That's the application. That you belong to God. That you
[3081.78 --> 3090.22]  have died in Christ. That you have risen with Christ. Consider that. Count yourself as that.
[3092.92 --> 3098.92]  And that's why you can't separate theology from ethics, right? So any growth in the Christian life,
[3098.92 --> 3107.24]  any living for God's glory is not just about our doing, but it's actually grasping more and more
[3107.24 --> 3115.80]  deeply what is now true of us. And so if you want to get practical, here's what you can do. Get a little,
[3116.42 --> 3124.28]  you know, yellow post-it note. Get a note of some sort and write on it, I am a Christian. And stick it
[3124.28 --> 3128.68]  on your refrigerator. Stick it on your bathroom mirror. Put it on your phone. Whatever it is.
[3129.64 --> 3137.08]  Because that's the first command, to count yourself as a Christian. And until then, therefore, you're
[3137.08 --> 3144.48]  able to live in light of that. And only to the extent that you consider deeply your new identity,
[3144.66 --> 3153.34]  I am a Christian, can you then live to serve God and live out the Christian life. So that's the first
[3153.34 --> 3160.72]  comment. The second comment is this. As we look at these commands in verses 11 to 13, they have both
[3160.72 --> 3167.90]  a negative and a positive aspect to them. So, like, notice, I think, you know, verse 11,
[3167.90 --> 3178.62]  consider yourself dead to sin. Negative. But alive to God. That's positive. Do not, verse 12, do not let
[3178.62 --> 3187.74]  sin reign. Negative. Do not offer any part. I think that's verse 13. Do not offer any part of yourself to sin.
[3187.74 --> 3197.18]  Negative. But rather, offer yourselves to God. Positive. Okay, and so there is deep biblical wisdom
[3197.18 --> 3202.46]  in this balance. And it tells us the Christian life is not just about saying no to some things.
[3202.46 --> 3209.86]  It's not just a negative life. It also means saying yes to other things. In the same way, the Christian
[3209.86 --> 3216.40]  life is not only about saying yes to some things. It's also about saying no to some things. And in
[3216.40 --> 3223.04]  fact, every yes has a corresponding no, and every no has a corresponding yes. That's the way the Ten
[3223.04 --> 3230.72]  Commandments work. It says do not, do not, do not, but as we consider that, it's also a do. Do the opposite.
[3230.72 --> 3239.96]  Pursue righteousness. You know, and I think for many of us, myself included, we are probably better
[3239.96 --> 3247.20]  at the negative aspect of the Christian life, right? We don't go around getting drunk.
[3247.80 --> 3254.60]  We don't go around gambling. We don't go around, you know, swearing so much. We don't do all these
[3254.60 --> 3263.76]  horrible things. We may swear sometimes. But the problem is, many of us might actually just be
[3263.76 --> 3270.38]  content to lie in the grave. We're just content to lie in the grave. What I mean, what I mean is,
[3270.52 --> 3276.80]  we've died to sin. And we're happy to just stay there. Just keep dying to sin, die to sin, okay.
[3276.80 --> 3284.76]  But the question is, are we alive to God? That's the positive, right? Okay, we're not doing so many
[3284.76 --> 3291.42]  bad things. Well, that's the easier part. How many of us are actually risen from the grave?
[3292.22 --> 3297.82]  How many of us are pursuing righteousness, living to God's glory in an active way,
[3297.96 --> 3304.52]  right? Something we all need to think about. And so the Christian life is not only about resisting sin,
[3304.52 --> 3309.16]  but it's about embracing life, embracing righteousness. Okay, so that's the second
[3309.16 --> 3314.14]  consideration that, you know, this command, it's the Christian life, it's about putting off and putting
[3314.14 --> 3319.14]  on a resistance and an embrace. And then the third thing to say, the final thing to say,
[3319.40 --> 3328.14]  is that the Christian life is a life of lifetime warfare. Lifetime warfare. And so it's interesting,
[3328.14 --> 3335.56]  this word instrument in verse 13 is actually the word for weapon. You can translate a weapon,
[3336.20 --> 3340.76]  which fits kind of nicely with this whole kingdom metaphor we've been considering. Paul is basically
[3340.76 --> 3349.90]  saying, if you are a Christian, stop arming the enemy powers with yourself. When you give yourselves to
[3349.90 --> 3362.96]  sin, you are a weapon for the enemy in this world. Stop being a weapon for the enemy. Instead, put on the
[3362.96 --> 3371.36]  armor of light. Arm yourselves to live for God's glory in the world, right? Because the thing is, there's no
[3371.36 --> 3377.52]  neutrality in the Christian life. There's no, like, you're not Switzerland, okay? You can't, and if you think
[3377.52 --> 3384.96]  that you're just being neutral, you've already lost. Whether you like it or not, you are actively promoting
[3384.96 --> 3394.66]  evil or the rule of sin by what you do. Or you are promoting the rule and reign of God by what you do, right?
[3394.72 --> 3402.48]  With every part of ourselves, he talks about our, the parts of our body, our hands, our eyes, our legs, our
[3402.48 --> 3408.74]  tongue, our mind, our heart, our ambition and creativity, our imagination, everything you have.
[3410.30 --> 3415.74]  So now, perhaps it would be helpful as we close and think about some application, just to think about
[3415.74 --> 3423.88]  a couple of the different parts of our bodies. He says, offer every part of your bodies as instruments,
[3423.98 --> 3431.32]  as weapons of righteousness. So how can we use the parts of our bodies and stop using them for sin
[3431.32 --> 3438.80]  and to start using them for righteousness? Okay, so let's think about our eyes, what we look at, what we see.
[3439.82 --> 3447.74]  How can we use our eyes more for God and less for sin? That might, you know, perhaps change the way
[3447.74 --> 3454.64]  we use the internet or what we watch on Netflix or YouTube or our social media news diet.
[3454.64 --> 3464.82]  Maybe these things should change. What about your feet? Where do your feet go, take you, that you,
[3465.00 --> 3471.34]  that could become places where you live for God's glory and not for evil, right? And so think about,
[3471.44 --> 3479.94]  like, maybe as your feet carry you into town, to work, to school, what would it look like to view all of
[3479.94 --> 3485.12]  those places that your feet take you as places where you can walk in righteousness and live for
[3485.12 --> 3492.80]  God's glory? What about our mouths, right? When you're tempted to say unkind things, how can you
[3492.80 --> 3498.54]  instead, right, not just the negative. So like, okay, I'm tempted to say something unkind. I've died with
[3498.54 --> 3508.12]  Christ. I won't say anything bad. Okay. How can we also use our bodies for good? How can we use them
[3508.12 --> 3516.30]  to speak words of love, to encourage, right? Words of encouragement. What about our backs? Now that
[3516.30 --> 3524.38]  might be kind of a weird one, but what do we do with our backs? Well, we carry things, right? So what are
[3524.38 --> 3534.04]  we carrying that might lead to righteousness instead of sin? Or maybe what could we carry of
[3534.04 --> 3539.24]  someone else's burdens to help them? Or what are we carrying that we simply just need to put down
[3539.24 --> 3547.88]  and stop carrying? See, friends, this is stuff that myself and all of us as Christians need to start
[3547.88 --> 3553.92]  getting practical. We need to start looking at this and living in this new lifestyle because God has given
[3553.92 --> 3560.56]  us a new life in Christ Jesus. So let's not just lie dead in the grave and be content with not sinning,
[3560.70 --> 3566.58]  but rather let's live for God in his glory, in his kingdom. Okay, so let me pray that God would help us.
[3569.76 --> 3576.90]  Our Father, we pray that you would bring us from the grave to the heavenly places where Christ is
[3576.90 --> 3582.74]  seated at the right hand of God, where we can set our minds on the things above, not on the things
[3582.74 --> 3593.58]  below. Help us, Lord, not to be halfway Christians, but to be those who walk by faith, loving you and
[3593.58 --> 3598.30]  loving our neighbor and being a witness to your kingdom. Would you help us by your spirit, for Jesus' sake?
[3598.88 --> 3599.16]  Amen.
[3602.58 --> 3605.80]  Let's all stand and we'll sing a song of response together.
[3605.80 --> 3635.78]  How great the chasm, the heavenly tree in us. How high the mountains I could not climb.
[3635.78 --> 3642.78]  In desperation, I turn to heaven. In desperation, I turn to heaven.
[3642.78 --> 3655.78]  And spoke your name into the night. And through the darkness, your loving kindness,
[3655.78 --> 3668.78]  the light, the light. And through the shadows of my soul. The work is finished. The end is written.
[3668.78 --> 3675.78]  Jesus Christ, my living God.
[3675.78 --> 3677.78]  Jesus Christ, my living God.
[3677.78 --> 3678.78]  Jesus Christ, my living God.
[3678.78 --> 3691.78]  Who could imagine so great a mercy? Our heart could fathom such wondrous praise.
[3691.78 --> 3693.78]  Jesus Christ, my living God.
[3693.78 --> 3694.78]  The Lord, I am the Lord.
[3694.78 --> 3696.78]  The Lord, I am the Lord.
[3696.78 --> 3699.78]  Let's all stand and sing.
[3699.78 --> 3701.78]  When I sing.
[3701.78 --> 3703.78]  And when I sing.
[3703.78 --> 3705.78]  And when I sing.
[3705.78 --> 3707.78]  The cross has spoken.
[3707.78 --> 3711.78]  I am forgiven.
[3711.78 --> 3718.78]  The King of kings calls me this on.
[3718.78 --> 3719.78]  The King of kings calls me this on.
[3719.78 --> 3720.78]  To live in the Lord.
[3720.78 --> 3721.78]  And the Lord.
[3721.78 --> 3722.78]  And the Lord.
[3722.78 --> 3723.78]  And the Lord.
[3723.78 --> 3724.78]  And the Lord.
[3724.78 --> 3725.78]  And the Lord.
[3725.78 --> 3726.78]  And the Lord.
[3726.78 --> 3727.78]  And the Lord.

[3901.78 --> 3910.78]  Are you all my living hope?
[3919.78 --> 3930.90]  So we continue to respond to God's grace in our lives and his word through the giving of our offerings.
[3931.74 --> 3939.22]  And our designated offering for today is for the Umran family through their mission work with Resonate Global Mission.
[3940.00 --> 3948.14]  And they serve in North Africa, helping to spread a gospel movement and plant churches and support indigenous leaders.
[3948.14 --> 3951.24]  And so we'll continue to give to their ministry.
[3951.72 --> 3955.34]  And may I ask the deacons to come forward to collect the offering.
[3978.14 --> 3979.14]  Thank you.
[3979.14 --> 3983.14]  Thank you.
[3983.14 --> 3984.14]  Thank you.
[3984.14 --> 3986.14]  Thank you.
[3986.14 --> 3988.14]  Thank you.
[3988.14 --> 3991.14]  Thank you.
[3991.14 --> 3996.14]  Thank you.
[3996.14 --> 4001.14]  Thank you.

[4003.14 --> 4005.14]  Amen.
[4033.14 --> 4035.14]  Amen.
[4063.14 --> 4065.14]  Amen.
[4093.14 --> 4095.14]  Amen.
[4123.14 --> 4125.14]  Amen.
[4153.14 --> 4163.42]  The flower connection is because Ted loves flowers.
[4164.50 --> 4164.64]  Yeah.
[4165.40 --> 4165.88]  Anyway.
[4166.10 --> 4166.34]  Okay.
[4166.46 --> 4172.96]  So, you know, we are a congregation of the living God, and he calls us then to go to
[4172.96 --> 4175.14]  him in prayer, to bring all of our needs before him.
[4175.20 --> 4176.48]  So, let's do that together now.
[4176.48 --> 4185.90]  Our Father and our God, you have called us out of darkness into the marvelous light of your love.
[4186.78 --> 4204.52]  And we have witnessed and we continue to witness by faith to the life and the death, the resurrection on the third day, the ascension into glory, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord and Savior.
[4204.52 --> 4211.16]  Father, it's in his precious name that we have access to you through the Spirit.
[4212.34 --> 4216.50]  And we are humbled and we are joyful, Lord, in your presence.
[4217.28 --> 4223.40]  And we come in thanksgiving for all of your mercy, for your grace to us as your children.
[4224.22 --> 4227.04]  Lord, please continue to fill us with the knowledge of your will.
[4227.94 --> 4229.90]  Give us all wisdom and understanding.
[4229.90 --> 4241.60]  Teach us to walk in a manner that is worthy and ever-pleasing to you, bearing fruit in every good work which you prepared beforehand that we should walk in it.
[4243.00 --> 4250.30]  And in your presence, Father, we find great comfort and security because we know that you love and care for us.
[4250.30 --> 4258.88]  And Lord, in this life, in this uncertain world, Lord, we ask for your hand to guide.
[4259.38 --> 4264.80]  Guide us, but Lord, guide so many other things in this world.
[4264.92 --> 4273.96]  And Lord, so would you guide our world leaders that they may lead with equity and compassion and with justice and mercy.
[4273.96 --> 4278.38]  Lord, we ask for peace in the war-torn countries around the world.
[4279.04 --> 4281.22]  We pray for protection for the weak and the helpless.
[4282.40 --> 4285.36]  Lord, let your justice come to all places.
[4285.36 --> 4291.88]  We also ask for our country, Lord, for cooperation amongst us.
[4292.88 --> 4295.50]  For wisdom that comes only from your throne.
[4296.50 --> 4302.52]  So that the good news of salvation in Christ might be proclaimed with power and be unheeded.
[4303.64 --> 4305.16]  Or unobstructed, that is.
[4305.26 --> 4307.00]  And may be fruitful in our country.
[4308.12 --> 4310.28]  And Father, we ask for your blessing upon our church.
[4310.28 --> 4322.64]  We remember, Lord, the Umrans serving you, whom you've called to go out from us, from this area, at least, Lord, to serve you in another part of the world.
[4323.78 --> 4329.12]  Lord, would you give them great success in your purposes and for the glory of Christ and his church.
[4330.62 --> 4333.86]  Lord, we pray for our upcoming summer camp.
[4334.04 --> 4338.14]  Lord, would you help us to share the gospel with children in our community
[4338.14 --> 4343.90]  so that they would then also come to know you and then take the knowledge of who you are into their families,
[4344.18 --> 4346.40]  into their schools, and everywhere else they go.
[4348.70 --> 4352.18]  And Lord, we pray for our own church family this morning.
[4353.08 --> 4359.34]  And we take a moment, Lord, to remember the needs, all of our needs before you for our church.
[4359.84 --> 4362.82]  We pray especially this morning for Art Hoekstra and Delta Hospital.
[4362.82 --> 4373.12]  Lord, we pray that for the needs that he has medically, Lord, that you would heal, that you would help the doctors,
[4373.66 --> 4379.64]  that you would help him, Lord, you restore him to health and to be able to walk and recover fully.
[4380.92 --> 4387.76]  Lord, we also pray for Nellie, as we are glad that she is now okay, but she is undergoing further tests.
[4387.76 --> 4394.92]  And Lord, we pray that the doctors would determine just what is wrong and what needs to be done to fix it.
[4395.14 --> 4401.16]  Lord, thank you for her joy and her gratitude to you for the life that you have given her.
[4402.62 --> 4408.70]  Father, there are many other concerns that we know about and many also, Lord, that remain unspoken.
[4409.60 --> 4413.02]  And Lord, all those that we carry in our hearts, we offer them to you now.
[4413.02 --> 4417.68]  Lord, we desire to live for your glory.
[4418.68 --> 4422.12]  Would you help us, Lord, to be faithful witnesses to your life and your kingdom.
[4422.86 --> 4425.80]  We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[4428.18 --> 4429.00]  Let's all stand.
[4431.06 --> 4434.34]  And as always, we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4434.40 --> 4440.78]  I want to invite you to join us for time of fellowship and coffee right through the doors into the fellowship hall.
[4440.78 --> 4444.72]  Now, I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[4445.44 --> 4447.00]  This comes from 2 Thessalonians.
[4447.42 --> 4455.74]  May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
[4456.38 --> 4460.92]  encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
[4461.58 --> 4463.04]  To his glory. Amen.
[4464.22 --> 4467.62]  So remain standing and we'll sing our final song as we prepare to lead.
[4467.62 --> 4485.78]  My friends may you grow in grace.
[4485.78 --> 4490.78]  In the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4490.78 --> 4497.98]  My friends may you grow in grace.
[4497.98 --> 4502.78]  In the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[4502.78 --> 4503.96]  To God.
[4504.00 --> 4507.10]  To God be the glory.
[4507.54 --> 4509.78]  Now and forever.
[4511.00 --> 4512.78]  Now and forever.
[4513.94 --> 4514.20]  Amen.
[4516.64 --> 4519.42]  To God be the glory.
[4520.42 --> 4522.04]  Now and forever.
[4523.70 --> 4525.40]  Now and forever.
[4526.04 --> 4526.52]  Amen.
[4526.52 --> 4537.66]  My friends, may you grow in grace
[4537.66 --> 4542.70]  In acknowledge of Lord and Savior
[4542.70 --> 4550.12]  My friends, may you grow in grace
[4550.12 --> 4554.98]  In acknowledge of Jesus Christ
[4554.98 --> 4562.06]  To God be the glory, now and forever
[4562.06 --> 4566.50]  Now and forever, amen
[4566.50 --> 4574.20]  To God be the glory, now and forever
[4574.20 --> 4578.64]  Now and forever, amen
[4584.98 --> 4592.98]  To God be the glory, now and forever
[4592.98 --> 4596.06]  Now and forever, amen
[4596.06 --> 4600.06]  To God be the glory, now and forever
[4600.06 --> 4615.14]  Now and forever, amen
[4615.14 --> 4617.28]  To God be the glory, now and forever
[4617.28 --> 4619.14]  Now and forever, amen
[4619.14 --> 4621.14]  To God be the glory, now and forever
