• The Lord's punishment of Naval and his eventual death as an example of God's justice and vengeance
• The theme of leaving revenge and judgment to God, citing Deuteronomy and the New Testament passages
• The parable of the wealthy man from Luke 12 is used to illustrate God's perspective on material wealth and preparations for the afterlife.
• Nabal's fate is tied to this parable, with God calling him a "fool" for prioritizing earthly possessions over spiritual richness towards God.
