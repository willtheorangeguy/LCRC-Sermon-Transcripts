[276.00 --> 278.00]  Amen.
[278.00 --> 282.00]  Good morning.
[282.00 --> 286.00]  Welcome to Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[286.00 --> 292.00]  To all present here and those joining with us via live stream, my name is Bev Banstra
[292.00 --> 297.00]  and I will be helping to lead our worship service along with our GEMS group.
[297.00 --> 302.00]  GEMS is a ministry of our church for girls grades 2 through 7.
[302.00 --> 309.00]  Girls in our church, other churches and also from the community whose purpose is to bring
[309.00 --> 313.00]  each girl into a dynamic relationship with Jesus.
[313.00 --> 318.00]  GEMS is an acronym for Girls Everywhere Meeting the Savior.
[318.00 --> 321.00]  Very happy to have you with us today.
[321.00 --> 328.00]  Pastor Jason will be bringing us God's word from the book of Romans later in the service.
[328.00 --> 335.00]  You are invited to join us for coffee and lots of cookies, I saw that, in the fellowship hall afterwards.
[335.00 --> 341.00]  Thanks to our coffee servers, the Vandercamps and also the GEMS.
[341.00 --> 345.00]  So after the service in the fellowship hall, we'd love to see you there.
[345.00 --> 362.00]  Just a reminder that a memorial service for Jerry and Ann Cron will be held here at Ladner CRC this Saturday, May 3 at 2 o'clock.
[362.00 --> 367.00]  Our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 100.
[367.00 --> 370.00]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[370.00 --> 373.00]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[373.00 --> 376.00]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[376.00 --> 379.00]  Know that the Lord is God.
[379.00 --> 382.00]  It is he who made us and we are his.
[382.00 --> 386.00]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[386.00 --> 392.00]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[392.00 --> 396.00]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[396.00 --> 401.00]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[401.00 --> 406.00]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[409.00 --> 412.00]  Please join me in this prayer of adoration.
[412.00 --> 413.00]  Let us pray.
[413.00 --> 426.00]  God of grace and glory, to this worried world, you reveal your presence in radiant glory and in gentle whispers,
[426.00 --> 440.00]  on mountain tops and in shadowed valleys, in classrooms and hospital beds, in homes and churches, in the quiet of nature and on busy streets.
[440.00 --> 446.00]  Yours is the presence that pushes past our fear to calm us.
[446.00 --> 451.00]  Yours is the love that transforms our doubt with reassurance.
[451.00 --> 457.00]  We come to dwell in your goodness and to offer you the praise you deserve.
[457.00 --> 458.00]  Amen.
[458.00 --> 470.00]  Please stand if you are able.
[470.00 --> 473.00]  The Lord's greeting comes from the book of Jude.
[473.00 --> 481.00]  To those who are called, who are beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ,
[481.00 --> 487.00]  may mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
[487.00 --> 491.00]  As God has greeted us, let us greet one another.
[491.00 --> 512.00]  Our hand goes the Lord's greet you.
[512.00 --> 541.98]  Thank you.
[542.00 --> 571.98]  Thank you.
[572.00 --> 574.00]  Thank you.
[602.00 --> 604.00]  Thank you.
[604.00 --> 606.00]  Thank you.
[634.00 --> 636.00]  Thank you.
[664.00 --> 666.00]  Thank you.
[666.00 --> 668.00]  Thank you.
[696.00 --> 698.00]  Thank you.
[698.00 --> 700.00]  Thank you.
[700.00 --> 702.00]  Thank you.
[702.00 --> 704.00]  Thank you.
[704.00 --> 706.00]  Thank you.
[706.00 --> 708.00]  Thank you.
[708.00 --> 710.00]  Thank you.
[710.00 --> 740.00] 
[740.00 --> 753.12]  If you come to me, how great thou art, how great thou art.
[753.12 --> 770.56]  I'll be reading from Isaiah 54, 9-10.
[771.84 --> 778.90]  To me, this is like the day of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never cover the earth.
[778.90 --> 784.02]  So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again.
[784.90 --> 791.12]  Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken,
[791.94 --> 796.80]  nor my covenant of peace be removed, says the Lord who has compassion on you.
[797.48 --> 800.82]  This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.
[808.90 --> 810.90]  Thank you.
[810.90 --> 812.90]  Thank you.
[812.90 --> 816.90]  Thank you.
[816.90 --> 818.90]  Thank you.
[818.90 --> 822.90]  Thank you.
[822.90 --> 836.90]  Thank you.
[836.90 --> 842.08]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[845.16 --> 850.08]  Our patience will wait as we constantly grow.
[851.00 --> 855.98]  A Father so tender is calling us home.
[855.98 --> 861.92]  He welcomes the weakest, the highest, the poor.
[861.92 --> 867.98]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[868.88 --> 875.92]  Till Lord, His mercy is poor.
[879.16 --> 883.78]  Stalk in the darkness, new light from Lord.
[883.78 --> 888.96]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[891.92 --> 897.70]  The riches of kindness He lavished on us.
[898.08 --> 902.94]  His life was a payment, His life was a cost.
[903.36 --> 908.48]  He stood near a debt we could never afford.
[908.48 --> 914.76]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[914.76 --> 923.92]  Praise the Lord, His mercy is poor.
[923.92 --> 929.92]  Stronger than darkness, new light from Lord.
[929.92 --> 935.64]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[935.64 --> 942.58]  Till Lord, His mercy is poor.
[942.58 --> 950.42]  Stronger than darkness, new light from Lord.
[950.42 --> 955.44]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[955.44 --> 960.90]  Our sins, they are many, His mercy is poor.
[960.90 --> 962.30]  Lord, ga' staff, praise the Lord.
[962.30 --> 966.70] 管 her.
[970.76 --> 975.50]  Thank you.
[975.50 --> 999.84]  Please join me in this litany of confession.
[999.84 --> 1010.82]  In a world where we are being pressured to conform at every turn, from culture to social media, God calls us to live differently in Romans 12 verse 2.
[1011.82 --> 1019.62]  Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[1020.24 --> 1028.16]  Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[1028.16 --> 1030.78]  Romans 12 verse 2
[1030.78 --> 1035.72]  Lord, we confess that it is easy to copy the ways of the world.
[1036.50 --> 1042.54]  Forgive us for the times we have chosen comfort over courage, popularity over purpose.
[1043.70 --> 1046.56]  Renew our hearts and minds, God.
[1047.22 --> 1052.56]  Transform us from the inside out and help us live for you.
[1052.56 --> 1060.92]  In the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and the word was God.
[1061.40 --> 1063.38]  John 1, 1
[1063.38 --> 1069.44]  Lord, thank you for sending Jesus, the word, to show us what you are like.
[1070.02 --> 1073.52]  You are with us, omnipotent, righteous, and directing us.
[1073.90 --> 1077.42]  You are the foundation of our faith and the source of all truth.
[1077.42 --> 1082.02]  Help us to trust your word, the Bible, and the standard for truth.
[1083.16 --> 1087.02]  God, we cannot live transformed on our own.
[1087.76 --> 1092.82]  Please equip us by your spirit to live differently than the world.
[1093.58 --> 1097.68]  Help us know your good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[1097.68 --> 1108.18]  Therefore, if anyone in Christ, the new creation has come, the old has gone, the new is here.
[1108.74 --> 1111.70]  2 Corinthians 5 verse 17
[1111.70 --> 1117.24]  Lord, because of what Jesus has done on the cross and in his resurrection,
[1117.72 --> 1122.16]  we can be forgiven for our sins and have a right relationship with you.
[1122.16 --> 1129.78]  When we trust you as Lord and Savior, you make us new, transform us from the inside out,
[1130.18 --> 1132.80]  and may we shine your love and truth in the world.
[1134.32 --> 1143.16]  All scripture is God-breathed and useful teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness,
[1143.72 --> 1149.52]  so that one servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[1149.52 --> 1160.66]  Lord, equip us to live as your people, boldly sharing the truth of scripture with others.
[1161.28 --> 1164.30]  Help us remember your word is the most powerful tool.
[1165.72 --> 1172.98]  God, help us to live out the truth of scripture and walk in obedience to you.
[1172.98 --> 1178.98]  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
[1179.48 --> 1181.22]  John 8 verse 32
[1181.22 --> 1186.44]  Father, your word set us free from the lies of the world.
[1187.10 --> 1191.70]  May we always stand firm on scripture as the ultimate standard of truth.
[1192.88 --> 1199.24]  Transform us from the inside out through your word and renew our minds.
[1199.24 --> 1205.58]  Lord, help us not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourself.
[1206.34 --> 1207.62]  Do what it says.
[1208.10 --> 1210.10]  James 1 verse 22
[1210.10 --> 1216.90]  Lord, help us not only to hear your word, but to live it out in our daily actions and choices.
[1218.68 --> 1222.64]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[1223.28 --> 1228.82]  baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1229.24 --> 1233.38]  You're teaching them everything I have commanded you.
[1234.04 --> 1238.54]  And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[1239.16 --> 1242.34]  Matthew 28, 19, 20
[1242.34 --> 1248.12]  You call each of us to show your love and tell the good news of Jesus Christ,
[1248.62 --> 1250.38]  so that others may come to know him.
[1250.38 --> 1254.20]  We need your help to carry out this mission.
[1254.88 --> 1260.70]  Strengthen us, Lord, so we can show you the gospel message that transforms lives.
[1261.36 --> 1265.30]  Make us bold messengers of the hope that we can have in you.
[1266.30 --> 1273.32]  We commit to living as your transformed people, shining in the world.
[1273.32 --> 1276.92]  And what does the Lord ever do?
[1278.12 --> 1283.40]  To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
[1283.86 --> 1285.72]  Micah 6 verse 8
[1285.72 --> 1289.54]  Together and with your help and guidance, Lord,
[1289.90 --> 1295.02]  we embrace your call to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with you.
[1295.02 --> 1299.30]  Lord, transform us from the inside out, Lord.
[1299.94 --> 1303.06]  Continue changing us inside out,
[1303.46 --> 1306.12]  so that we look more and more like you.
[1306.86 --> 1309.26]  And we think, say, and do.
[1309.74 --> 1313.32]  We pray this in your name and your glory, Lord.
[1313.82 --> 1314.20]  Amen.
[1314.20 --> 1314.38]  Amen.
[1325.02 --> 1329.70]  Please rise.
[1329.70 --> 1329.76]  Amen.
[1355.02 --> 1364.98]  He has shown thee, O man, O man,
[1365.66 --> 1370.84]  But he is good and what the Lord requires of thee.
[1371.76 --> 1379.60]  He has shown thee, Amen, O man,
[1379.60 --> 1385.86]  When it is good and what thou hold me, are so vain.
[1385.86 --> 1399.86]  But to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
[1399.86 --> 1407.12]  Yes, show me, amen.
[1407.12 --> 1413.36]  When it is good and what thou hold me, are so vain.
[1414.36 --> 1419.12]  Yes, show me, amen.
[1421.12 --> 1426.80]  When it is good and what thou hold me, are so vain.
[1426.80 --> 1441.16]  But to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
[1441.16 --> 1455.10]  But to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
[1456.80 --> 1482.66]  We won't fear the battle.
[1482.66 --> 1485.06]  We won't fear the night.
[1485.20 --> 1487.56]  We will walk the valley.
[1487.90 --> 1489.80]  We do by our side.
[1490.24 --> 1492.50]  You will go before us.
[1492.58 --> 1494.22]  You will lead the way.
[1494.76 --> 1496.66]  We have found a refuge.
[1497.20 --> 1498.66]  Only you can stay.
[1500.42 --> 1502.80]  Take this joy now.
[1503.12 --> 1505.04]  Our God is for us.
[1505.42 --> 1508.66]  The plodders of His strong and mighty fortress.
[1508.66 --> 1512.00]  Raise your voice now.
[1512.00 --> 1513.90]  Your love is major.
[1513.90 --> 1516.00]  Who can stand against us?
[1516.00 --> 1518.72]  For God is for us.
[1518.72 --> 1527.72]  Even when I stumble.
[1527.72 --> 1529.56]  Even when I stumble.
[1530.06 --> 1531.72]  Even when I fall.
[1532.26 --> 1534.48]  Even when I turn back.
[1534.62 --> 1536.26]  Till your love is sure.
[1536.26 --> 1538.66]  You will not abandon.
[1539.18 --> 1540.88]  You will not forsake.
[1540.88 --> 1543.20]  You will cheer me up.
[1543.28 --> 1546.02]  For forever-ending places.
[1547.02 --> 1549.42]  Sing with joy now.
[1549.74 --> 1551.64]  Our God is for us.
[1552.02 --> 1555.90]  The plodders of His strong and mighty fortress.
[1556.34 --> 1558.60]  Raise your voice now.
[1559.00 --> 1560.46]  Your love is major.
[1561.00 --> 1562.66]  And can stand against us.
[1562.66 --> 1565.54]  Since our God is for us.
[1565.54 --> 1567.54]  The plodders of His strong and mighty fortress.
[1567.54 --> 1569.54]  He will be the best.
[1569.54 --> 1570.54]  He will be the best.
[1570.54 --> 1572.54]  He will be the best.
[1572.54 --> 1573.54]  He will be the best.
[1573.54 --> 1574.54]  He will be the best.
[1574.54 --> 1575.54]  Behind our depths.
[1575.54 --> 1576.20]  Behind our depths.
[1576.40 --> 1578.82]  He'll separate us.
[1578.82 --> 1580.72]  Hell and death.
[1581.10 --> 1583.48]  The God defeat us.
[1583.64 --> 1587.90]  He who gave His Son to free us.
[1588.12 --> 1591.12]  Holds me in His heart.
[1592.02 --> 1593.20]  Behind our depths.
[1593.20 --> 1595.20]  The plodders of His love.
[1595.20 --> 1596.56]  The plodders of His love.
[1596.56 --> 1597.72]  He will be the best.
[1597.80 --> 1598.96]  He will be the best.
[1598.96 --> 1600.14]  The plodders of His love.
[1600.14 --> 1601.42]  The plodders of His love.
[1601.42 --> 1605.68]  Freedom gave His son to free us.
[1605.84 --> 1608.82]  Holds me in His heart.
[1612.32 --> 1614.80]  Sing with joy now.
[1615.22 --> 1616.98]  Our God is for us.
[1617.36 --> 1618.82]  With father's love.
[1619.00 --> 1620.38]  His strong and mighty fortress.
[1621.62 --> 1623.18]  Raise your voice.
[1623.18 --> 1625.68]  Now, the love is greater.
[1626.12 --> 1630.46]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1631.16 --> 1634.84]  There's joy now, our heart is for us.
[1635.24 --> 1638.98]  The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[1639.46 --> 1641.58]  Praise the love, who is now?
[1641.58 --> 1643.54]  Your love is greater.
[1643.90 --> 1648.40]  Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[1653.18 --> 1681.20]  At this time, our children ages 3 through grade 5 are dismissed for Sunday school.
[1681.20 --> 1685.40]  And may God bless you as you go and bless your teachers too.
[1711.20 --> 1715.16]  Romans 5, 6 to 11.
[1715.16 --> 1724.30]  You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
[1725.08 --> 1732.00]  Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die.
[1732.84 --> 1737.38]  But God demonstrates his own love for us in this.
[1737.70 --> 1740.38]  While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[1740.38 --> 1748.02]  Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him?
[1749.22 --> 1755.68]  For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his son,
[1756.12 --> 1760.54]  how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life?
[1760.54 --> 1767.34]  Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1767.90 --> 1770.12]  through whom we have now received reconciliation.
[1771.28 --> 1772.90]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1773.50 --> 1774.76]  Thanks be to God.
[1774.76 --> 1789.48]  Thank you very much, Peyton.
[1789.76 --> 1790.62]  Very well read.
[1791.66 --> 1795.34]  For those of you whom I have not met, my name is Jason.
[1795.54 --> 1797.08]  I'm grateful to be a pastor here.
[1798.82 --> 1804.40]  So we are parachuting back into the book of Romans.
[1804.76 --> 1810.20]  We spent the last few weeks in the Old Testament book of Lamentations during the season of Lent.
[1810.64 --> 1816.40]  But today we're jumping back in Romans and picking up where we left off back last time.
[1816.96 --> 1821.16]  So as we come to the Lord's word, let's go to him in prayer.
[1821.72 --> 1825.16]  As we commit these words to the Lord our God.
[1826.02 --> 1830.74]  Heavenly Father, as we listen to your word and Holy Scripture this morning,
[1830.74 --> 1835.26]  Lord, we do ask that you would convince us of your love.
[1836.40 --> 1840.10]  That you would assure us of our salvation in Christ.
[1840.74 --> 1842.56]  And that we would have joy in you.
[1843.24 --> 1850.14]  And we pray, Lord, that you would please etch these words very deeply into our hearts and minds.
[1850.14 --> 1853.00]  And we pray this in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[1853.58 --> 1853.98]  Amen.
[1856.80 --> 1860.52]  How does God make us his friends?
[1862.12 --> 1864.30]  That's the big idea of this passage.
[1864.30 --> 1867.94]  That once we were enemies of God.
[1868.12 --> 1870.56]  We were even fighting against God.
[1870.66 --> 1871.78]  We were hating God.
[1872.32 --> 1874.40]  But God has made us his friends.
[1874.66 --> 1878.16]  So that now we can love him and trust him.
[1878.56 --> 1880.44]  And we want to draw close to him.
[1881.38 --> 1881.58]  Right?
[1881.64 --> 1886.22]  Our relationship with God went from enemies to friends.
[1886.22 --> 1892.98]  So gems, I'm going to try to direct some of my, you know, preaching to you this morning.
[1893.38 --> 1894.30]  So be ready.
[1894.86 --> 1896.16]  I have a question for you.
[1896.78 --> 1899.02]  Do you think it's easy to make friends?
[1901.28 --> 1902.64]  I see some yes.
[1902.82 --> 1904.16]  I see some no.
[1904.86 --> 1905.14]  Yeah.
[1905.70 --> 1908.50]  Or maybe some circles.
[1909.64 --> 1909.74]  Right?
[1910.12 --> 1915.36]  You know, sometimes even if we want to make friends with someone, it doesn't always go well.
[1916.22 --> 1920.04]  You know, maybe there's another girl in school and you really want to be friends with her.
[1920.76 --> 1922.08]  Maybe you try to be nice.
[1922.24 --> 1923.64]  You say, let's play.
[1923.74 --> 1924.48]  Let's hang out.
[1925.14 --> 1927.52]  But no matter what you do, nothing seems to work.
[1928.22 --> 1928.68]  Right?
[1928.72 --> 1933.06]  She just doesn't really want to become your friend for whatever reason.
[1934.10 --> 1935.30]  You know, that happens sometimes.
[1937.18 --> 1940.34]  Sometimes enemies stay enemies.
[1940.74 --> 1946.02]  And here's another example of reconciliation not going well.
[1946.22 --> 1950.58]  So I was watching the movie Unbroken the other night with my family.
[1950.68 --> 1955.82]  It's about a guy named Louis Zamperini who was a boy who grew up to be an Olympic runner.
[1956.78 --> 1965.90]  While fighting in World War II, he survived a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean and spends 47 days adrift at sea.
[1966.50 --> 1967.28]  Can you imagine that?
[1967.42 --> 1970.80]  47 days in a life raft.
[1970.80 --> 1978.80]  One time during a heavy storm at sea when the raft is getting tossed to and fro by the waves,
[1979.54 --> 1981.26]  Louis prays to God and says,
[1981.36 --> 1985.14]  God, if you spare my life, I will give my life to you.
[1985.20 --> 1986.44]  I will do whatever you ask.
[1986.44 --> 1990.80]  Well, he finally gets rescued by a passing ship.
[1991.18 --> 1992.20]  That's the good news.
[1992.28 --> 1994.78]  The bad news, it was an enemy ship.
[1995.60 --> 1999.52]  So he was already in very bad shape from being lost at sea.
[1999.96 --> 2007.48]  And then he spent the next two and a half years as a prisoner of war in a Japanese prisoner of war camp where he was treated very badly.
[2007.48 --> 2009.80]  And he had very many enemies.
[2010.44 --> 2013.00]  But in the end, God spared his life.
[2013.10 --> 2014.18]  He was able to go home.
[2014.66 --> 2019.42]  And he kept his promise to God to do whatever God asked him to do.
[2019.88 --> 2023.90]  And one of the things God asked him to do was to forgive his enemies.
[2023.90 --> 2029.92]  So these Japanese guards who were mistreating him at the prison.
[2030.06 --> 2031.36]  And so he goes back to Japan.
[2031.74 --> 2041.20]  He tries to meet with the men who really were very mean to him and offered forgiveness.
[2041.94 --> 2048.80]  But his main enemy, who was in charge of the prison, refused to meet him and refused to be reconciled.
[2049.86 --> 2052.94]  And so in this instance, reconciliation doesn't go well at all.
[2052.94 --> 2056.76]  Sometimes enemies don't become friends.
[2057.52 --> 2066.00]  But in our passage today, the amazing thing that happens is that reconciliation goes very, very well.
[2066.54 --> 2066.98]  Right?
[2067.06 --> 2068.94]  We were enemies of God.
[2069.80 --> 2071.86]  But God forgives our sins.
[2072.08 --> 2073.98]  He shows his love for us.
[2073.98 --> 2075.54]  And we become God's friends.
[2076.34 --> 2081.82]  And so as we look at our passage today, I think there are three things that the Apostle Paul tells us here
[2081.82 --> 2087.58]  about how God makes friends from enemies.
[2087.90 --> 2089.40]  How God makes us his friends.
[2089.82 --> 2092.24]  First, God shows us his love.
[2093.28 --> 2096.16]  Secondly, he assures us of salvation.
[2096.40 --> 2099.48]  And then that means that we can have a joyful confidence in God.
[2099.90 --> 2101.00]  Can you all hear me okay?
[2101.12 --> 2101.98]  I feel like it's not quite.
[2102.86 --> 2103.54]  We're okay?
[2103.70 --> 2103.94]  All right.
[2103.94 --> 2104.94]  Okay.
[2104.94 --> 2105.94]  Okay.
[2106.02 --> 2112.38]  So here is the first thing we're going to look at today is the way that God shows his love for us.
[2113.52 --> 2122.80]  In these verses, Paul speaks of Christ's death on the cross as the proof of the Father's love for us.
[2123.30 --> 2125.58]  How do people sometimes prove their love?
[2125.58 --> 2129.60]  They might say they love you.
[2130.02 --> 2131.74]  They might say kind things to you.
[2131.88 --> 2134.46]  They might give you a gift or do things for you.
[2134.90 --> 2139.86]  And so often what we see is that love is expressed through action.
[2140.24 --> 2142.28]  And that's the way God showed his love for us.
[2142.32 --> 2145.32]  So let's look at our passage, verses 6 to 8.
[2147.08 --> 2147.80]  Paul writes,
[2147.80 --> 2177.44]  Now, you know, when people like you and I, when we love someone, we usually love another person.
[2177.44 --> 2179.66]  Because there's something attractive about them.
[2180.28 --> 2180.50]  Right?
[2180.52 --> 2183.42]  We don't naturally love people who hate us.
[2183.84 --> 2187.86]  We don't love people who are not kind to us.
[2188.88 --> 2189.10]  Right?
[2189.12 --> 2192.84]  We usually love someone because there's something sort of attractive about them.
[2193.34 --> 2194.86]  There's something we love about them.
[2195.90 --> 2199.74]  In this way, our love is always responsive.
[2200.42 --> 2200.54]  Right?
[2200.56 --> 2202.84]  We're responding to something that we see in the other person.
[2203.38 --> 2205.78]  But God's love is not like that at all.
[2206.38 --> 2206.50]  Right?
[2206.50 --> 2211.50]  God loves us when there was nothing lovable in us.
[2211.62 --> 2213.80]  When we were not worthy of his love.
[2214.44 --> 2221.18]  So look at the way that Paul describes our human condition before we met Christ.
[2221.58 --> 2223.02]  So look at verse 6.
[2224.62 --> 2228.74]  You see, just at the right time, when we were still powerless,
[2228.74 --> 2232.14]  Christ died for who?
[2233.70 --> 2234.06]  Girls?
[2235.62 --> 2236.62]  The ungodly.
[2236.62 --> 2236.98]  Right?
[2237.48 --> 2238.72]  Christ died for the ungodly.
[2239.06 --> 2242.78]  And this word powerless, it's not physical weakness.
[2242.96 --> 2244.50]  Sometimes we feel physically weak.
[2244.54 --> 2245.34]  Like you're sick.
[2245.58 --> 2246.56]  You're tired.
[2246.56 --> 2247.80]  I just can't get up.
[2247.84 --> 2248.80]  I don't want to go to school.
[2248.98 --> 2249.58]  I'm tired.
[2249.68 --> 2250.08]  I'm sick.
[2250.96 --> 2252.62]  That's not what he's talking about here.
[2252.68 --> 2255.26]  He's actually talking about being spiritually powerless.
[2255.68 --> 2260.42]  That we are simply unable in our weakness to love God.
[2260.42 --> 2263.74]  Now, then look at verse 8.
[2264.64 --> 2265.16]  It says,
[2265.72 --> 2268.40]  But God demonstrates his own love for us in this,
[2268.48 --> 2273.36]  that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[2273.84 --> 2275.40]  And then later in verse 10, it says,
[2275.78 --> 2278.78]  That we were enemies, and God loved us.
[2278.78 --> 2280.98]  So what's Paul saying here?
[2281.08 --> 2281.58]  He's saying,
[2282.44 --> 2287.18]  It's not after we repent and decide we want to follow Jesus,
[2287.36 --> 2288.40]  that he died for you.
[2288.84 --> 2290.94]  But it is while we were ungodly.
[2291.80 --> 2297.14]  While nothing in your life reflected or was aligned with God,
[2297.26 --> 2298.66]  that's when he died for you.
[2300.22 --> 2300.46]  Right?
[2300.54 --> 2302.44]  Not while you were friends with God,
[2302.66 --> 2305.54]  but while you were dead set against him,
[2305.82 --> 2308.32]  living your own way, rejecting his way,
[2308.32 --> 2311.14]  that's when God died for you.
[2311.94 --> 2312.50]  Right?
[2312.58 --> 2314.76]  Not when we were able to love God,
[2315.30 --> 2319.96]  but it was actually when we were too weak to even seek him,
[2320.02 --> 2321.06]  to even love him.
[2321.20 --> 2324.10]  That is when Christ died for you.
[2325.76 --> 2328.88]  And so Paul's point here is that there is nothing in us
[2328.88 --> 2331.78]  that could deserve God's love.
[2332.58 --> 2337.16]  Nothing in us is worthy of God's love.
[2337.16 --> 2342.50]  And yet, that is precisely when he loved us.
[2343.42 --> 2345.28]  And friends, this is the good news of the gospel,
[2345.40 --> 2348.02]  that even while we were at our very worst,
[2348.12 --> 2350.44]  God gave us his very best.
[2351.90 --> 2354.88]  Now, do you all like to receive gifts?
[2356.14 --> 2357.56]  Do you like to give gifts?
[2358.70 --> 2358.98]  Yeah.
[2359.26 --> 2359.46]  Cool.
[2359.46 --> 2362.42]  Now, back in Paul's day,
[2362.52 --> 2363.96]  back in the ancient world,
[2364.34 --> 2365.70]  people liked to give gifts too.
[2366.54 --> 2369.26]  But it was assumed that you would give good gifts
[2369.26 --> 2372.68]  to people who are worthy to receive good gifts.
[2373.28 --> 2373.50]  Right?
[2373.70 --> 2375.26]  And the greater the gift,
[2375.34 --> 2376.22]  the most costly,
[2376.38 --> 2377.70]  the most amazing the gift,
[2377.90 --> 2380.32]  would only be given to the person
[2380.32 --> 2382.66]  who was the most worthy
[2382.66 --> 2384.46]  to receive that gift.
[2384.46 --> 2387.02]  And that's why when Jesus was born,
[2387.18 --> 2389.08]  what gifts did the Magi bring him?
[2390.30 --> 2390.90]  Quiz.
[2392.32 --> 2392.92]  Remember?
[2393.64 --> 2397.18]  Gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
[2397.54 --> 2397.82]  Right?
[2398.36 --> 2398.86]  Why?
[2399.36 --> 2401.46]  Because these were costly gifts
[2401.46 --> 2403.04]  that were fitting,
[2403.80 --> 2404.68]  not for anybody,
[2405.18 --> 2406.48]  but they were fitting for a king.
[2406.48 --> 2410.08]  Now, here, Paul says
[2410.08 --> 2411.52]  that the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2411.52 --> 2413.32]  is exactly the opposite of that.
[2414.06 --> 2414.20]  Right?
[2414.28 --> 2415.56]  God gives the greatest,
[2415.84 --> 2417.20]  the most costly gift
[2417.20 --> 2418.90]  to the people,
[2419.02 --> 2420.76]  not who are kings
[2420.76 --> 2421.92]  and the most worthy,
[2422.40 --> 2425.88]  but to the most unworthy recipients.
[2426.98 --> 2428.32]  Christ's death here shows us,
[2428.34 --> 2429.32]  and it proves,
[2429.72 --> 2431.24]  God loves us.
[2431.50 --> 2432.34]  And it's not because
[2432.34 --> 2433.50]  we are worthy of his love,
[2433.50 --> 2435.82]  but simply because he is a God
[2435.82 --> 2438.88]  who simply chooses to love us.
[2439.56 --> 2441.02]  And that's the glory of the gospel,
[2441.12 --> 2443.66]  that Christ died for sinners,
[2444.02 --> 2445.06]  for the ungodly,
[2445.26 --> 2446.06]  for enemies,
[2446.60 --> 2447.62]  for the weak.
[2448.14 --> 2449.12]  And that's us.
[2450.22 --> 2450.38]  Okay?
[2450.46 --> 2453.24]  And that's how God shows us his love,
[2453.32 --> 2455.68]  that he gave his life for us,
[2455.72 --> 2456.52]  to show us his love.
[2456.90 --> 2457.72]  And that brings us
[2457.72 --> 2459.02]  to the second thing we see here,
[2459.08 --> 2461.12]  that God makes us his friends
[2461.12 --> 2463.92]  not only by showing us his love,
[2463.92 --> 2466.32]  but he then assures us
[2466.32 --> 2467.82]  of our salvation.
[2468.82 --> 2468.98]  Okay?
[2469.04 --> 2470.68]  So we can have assurance
[2470.68 --> 2473.86]  because of what Christ's death
[2473.86 --> 2474.82]  on the cross
[2474.82 --> 2476.64]  accomplished for us.
[2476.88 --> 2478.56]  So let's have a look at verse 9.
[2480.06 --> 2480.88]  It says,
[2481.26 --> 2483.26]  Since we have now been justified
[2483.26 --> 2484.40]  by his blood,
[2484.60 --> 2486.70]  how much more shall we be saved
[2486.70 --> 2488.20]  from God's wrath through him?
[2488.20 --> 2488.52]  Now,
[2490.52 --> 2492.38]  who understands what that says?
[2493.66 --> 2494.90]  It's pretty tricky,
[2495.50 --> 2495.96]  actually,
[2496.14 --> 2496.62]  I think.
[2497.18 --> 2498.60]  It's also very exciting.
[2499.42 --> 2499.62]  Okay?
[2499.88 --> 2502.54]  So it's saying a lot,
[2502.64 --> 2504.02]  it's very exciting stuff,
[2504.10 --> 2504.96]  but it's a little bit hard
[2504.96 --> 2505.70]  to understand.
[2507.10 --> 2507.50]  So,
[2507.86 --> 2510.02]  I love triangles.
[2510.42 --> 2511.20]  Do you love triangles?
[2512.02 --> 2513.34]  Pizza is in the shape of a triangle?
[2513.94 --> 2515.10]  That's a good reason to love it.
[2515.24 --> 2515.40]  Okay.
[2515.40 --> 2516.92]  Doritos.
[2519.04 --> 2519.40]  Okay.
[2520.96 --> 2522.20]  The seaweed triangles,
[2522.32 --> 2523.04]  do you guys know those?
[2523.08 --> 2524.20]  If you go to like a Japanese store,
[2524.26 --> 2525.02]  they have the seaweed
[2525.02 --> 2526.02]  and the rice inside.
[2526.14 --> 2526.60]  It's a triangle.
[2527.02 --> 2527.26]  Okay,
[2527.30 --> 2527.86]  I'm way off topic.
[2528.20 --> 2528.48]  Anyway,
[2529.14 --> 2530.40]  I'm going to show you a triangle
[2530.40 --> 2532.76]  and I hope,
[2532.86 --> 2533.78]  I think this might help us
[2533.78 --> 2535.54]  understand verse 9.
[2535.72 --> 2536.56]  Let's look at our triangle.
[2537.62 --> 2537.90]  Okay.
[2538.38 --> 2538.78]  Now,
[2538.90 --> 2539.86]  since you are all
[2539.86 --> 2541.06]  biblical scholars
[2541.06 --> 2541.40]  and theologians,
[2542.22 --> 2543.24]  we're going to use
[2543.24 --> 2544.66]  some theological words.
[2544.66 --> 2546.18]  So what do we have?
[2547.20 --> 2547.86]  Up top,
[2547.94 --> 2548.54]  we have God
[2548.54 --> 2550.34]  and then we have Jesus,
[2550.58 --> 2551.06]  the Son,
[2551.80 --> 2552.68]  and then we have us.
[2554.00 --> 2556.46]  And the way that God saves us,
[2556.82 --> 2558.08]  the way he deals with us
[2558.08 --> 2560.28]  is found in three words
[2560.28 --> 2561.68]  that you will not use very often.
[2562.32 --> 2562.48]  Okay.
[2562.54 --> 2564.08]  They are propitiation.
[2564.30 --> 2565.10]  Say propitiation.
[2566.82 --> 2568.14]  Say expiation.
[2569.26 --> 2570.22]  And justification.
[2571.62 --> 2572.02]  Okay.
[2572.14 --> 2572.94]  You are all very smart.
[2572.94 --> 2573.60]  That was good.
[2574.54 --> 2574.88]  So,
[2575.16 --> 2575.82]  verse 9
[2575.82 --> 2577.64]  tells us first
[2577.64 --> 2578.72]  that we are saved
[2578.72 --> 2581.02]  from God's wrath.
[2581.40 --> 2582.70]  That is propitiation.
[2582.80 --> 2584.12]  So what Jesus does
[2584.12 --> 2585.32]  in relationship to God
[2585.32 --> 2586.22]  is he absorbs
[2586.22 --> 2587.40]  the wrath of God.
[2588.24 --> 2588.48]  Now,
[2588.54 --> 2589.66]  when we think about God's wrath,
[2589.76 --> 2590.52]  it's not just God
[2590.52 --> 2591.32]  being cranky
[2591.32 --> 2592.18]  and irritable
[2592.18 --> 2592.94]  and harsh
[2592.94 --> 2594.16]  like a father
[2594.16 --> 2595.50]  who loses patience
[2595.50 --> 2596.26]  with his daughter.
[2596.82 --> 2597.78]  That's not the way
[2597.78 --> 2599.30]  God's wrath is.
[2599.78 --> 2600.44]  God's wrath
[2600.44 --> 2601.16]  wrath is actually
[2601.16 --> 2602.66]  an aspect of his holiness.
[2603.22 --> 2603.82]  Right?
[2603.92 --> 2605.54]  That God opposes
[2605.54 --> 2607.10]  sin and evil.
[2607.60 --> 2608.20]  Right?
[2608.28 --> 2609.20]  Because God is holy,
[2609.32 --> 2611.10]  he opposes any sin
[2611.10 --> 2611.90]  or evil
[2611.90 --> 2613.06]  in his world.
[2614.54 --> 2616.22]  Any form of opposition
[2616.22 --> 2616.80]  to him.
[2617.52 --> 2618.18]  And because,
[2618.32 --> 2618.74]  by nature,
[2618.74 --> 2619.66]  we are sinners
[2619.66 --> 2620.98]  and enemies of God,
[2621.20 --> 2622.20]  what Jesus did
[2622.20 --> 2623.22]  to save us
[2623.22 --> 2624.86]  is not just
[2624.86 --> 2625.46]  that he
[2625.46 --> 2626.70]  saved us
[2626.70 --> 2627.72]  because we were broken
[2627.72 --> 2628.74]  and we needed healing.
[2629.36 --> 2630.14]  And not just because
[2630.14 --> 2630.80]  we were lost
[2630.80 --> 2631.72]  and needed to be found
[2631.72 --> 2632.60]  or that we were blind
[2632.60 --> 2633.42]  and needed to see,
[2633.62 --> 2634.66]  but we were in danger
[2634.66 --> 2635.50]  of judgment
[2635.50 --> 2637.40]  because God is opposed
[2637.40 --> 2637.84]  to evil
[2637.84 --> 2639.46]  and we needed
[2639.46 --> 2640.40]  to be saved
[2640.40 --> 2640.98]  from that.
[2642.14 --> 2643.10]  And so on the cross,
[2643.22 --> 2644.06]  Jesus absorbed
[2644.06 --> 2645.50]  God's holy opposition
[2645.50 --> 2646.04]  to sin
[2646.04 --> 2647.34]  so that it wouldn't
[2647.34 --> 2648.08]  fall on us.
[2648.56 --> 2649.68]  So that on the day
[2649.68 --> 2650.12]  of judgment,
[2650.34 --> 2651.74]  when we come before
[2651.74 --> 2652.46]  the judgment seat
[2652.46 --> 2653.52]  of God in heaven,
[2654.22 --> 2655.28]  we will not meet
[2655.28 --> 2656.66]  a God who is opposed
[2656.66 --> 2657.36]  to us,
[2657.60 --> 2658.34]  but a God
[2658.34 --> 2659.62]  who welcomes us.
[2660.88 --> 2661.04]  Okay,
[2661.08 --> 2662.00]  and then the second thing
[2662.00 --> 2663.10]  that Jesus does for us
[2663.10 --> 2664.52]  is called expiation
[2664.52 --> 2665.76]  and what is that?
[2667.26 --> 2668.62]  It's a covering for sin.
[2668.80 --> 2669.52]  We are covered
[2669.52 --> 2671.04]  by Christ's blood.
[2671.40 --> 2671.84]  So you know
[2671.84 --> 2672.50]  in the Old Testament
[2672.50 --> 2673.50]  all the sacrifices,
[2673.66 --> 2674.26]  all the animals
[2674.26 --> 2674.90]  who were sacrificed
[2674.90 --> 2675.54]  at the temple,
[2676.16 --> 2677.36]  that was all pointing
[2677.36 --> 2678.70]  forward to Jesus
[2678.70 --> 2680.06]  who came to be
[2680.06 --> 2681.56]  our perfect sacrifice
[2681.56 --> 2682.82]  so that because
[2682.82 --> 2683.74]  of his death,
[2683.84 --> 2684.72]  his blood was shed,
[2685.04 --> 2685.70]  our sins
[2685.70 --> 2686.32]  could be forgiven.
[2686.66 --> 2687.78]  So in the way
[2687.78 --> 2689.54]  Jesus interacts
[2689.54 --> 2690.44]  with us
[2690.44 --> 2691.76]  is through covering
[2691.76 --> 2692.54]  our sin
[2692.54 --> 2693.32]  with his own blood.
[2694.90 --> 2695.68]  And then third,
[2695.90 --> 2696.76]  because Jesus
[2696.76 --> 2697.56]  absorbed the wrath
[2697.56 --> 2697.90]  of God,
[2697.96 --> 2698.76]  because he's covered
[2698.76 --> 2699.30]  our sin,
[2699.56 --> 2700.30]  the relationship
[2700.30 --> 2701.68]  that we now have
[2701.68 --> 2702.32]  with God
[2702.32 --> 2704.06]  is one of justification.
[2704.54 --> 2705.26]  What does that mean?
[2705.90 --> 2706.68]  It means that God
[2706.68 --> 2707.52]  makes us his friends.
[2708.48 --> 2709.24]  It means that we
[2709.24 --> 2710.48]  are reconciled
[2710.48 --> 2711.26]  with God.
[2712.28 --> 2713.40]  And the thing is,
[2713.44 --> 2713.84]  you can be
[2713.84 --> 2715.20]  absolutely confident
[2715.20 --> 2717.24]  that because
[2717.24 --> 2718.02]  of what Jesus
[2718.02 --> 2719.04]  has done,
[2719.14 --> 2720.22]  you will always
[2720.22 --> 2721.32]  remain God's friend.
[2722.28 --> 2723.02]  And that's what
[2723.02 --> 2723.94]  verse 10 is about.
[2724.14 --> 2725.14]  Let's look at verse 10,
[2725.30 --> 2726.02]  what Paul says.
[2726.72 --> 2727.40]  For if,
[2727.54 --> 2728.24]  while we were
[2728.24 --> 2728.90]  God's enemies,
[2729.04 --> 2730.10]  we were reconciled
[2730.10 --> 2730.68]  to him
[2730.68 --> 2731.60]  through the death
[2731.60 --> 2732.16]  of his son,
[2732.62 --> 2734.42]  how much more,
[2735.22 --> 2736.64]  having been reconciled,
[2736.64 --> 2738.16]  shall we be saved
[2738.16 --> 2739.24]  through his life?
[2739.24 --> 2740.56]  Right?
[2740.64 --> 2741.24]  He's saying,
[2741.60 --> 2742.72]  if God loved us
[2742.72 --> 2744.02]  with such a deep love
[2744.02 --> 2745.78]  while we were sinners
[2745.78 --> 2747.12]  and weak and enemies,
[2747.46 --> 2749.32]  can you imagine
[2749.32 --> 2750.20]  the love he has
[2750.20 --> 2751.22]  for us now
[2751.22 --> 2752.74]  that we are his children?
[2754.12 --> 2754.64]  In other words,
[2754.70 --> 2755.06]  God says,
[2755.18 --> 2756.38]  making you my friends
[2756.38 --> 2757.74]  was hard work.
[2758.86 --> 2759.40]  Right?
[2759.60 --> 2760.54]  Jesus had to come
[2760.54 --> 2761.40]  and he suffered
[2761.40 --> 2762.06]  and died.
[2762.40 --> 2763.48]  He did all that stuff.
[2763.94 --> 2764.64]  But now,
[2764.64 --> 2766.46]  now that he's made you
[2766.46 --> 2767.68]  his friends,
[2767.84 --> 2768.54]  keeping you
[2768.54 --> 2769.26]  as his friends,
[2769.40 --> 2770.14]  that's easier.
[2771.58 --> 2772.98]  And since nothing
[2772.98 --> 2773.84]  in us
[2773.84 --> 2774.92]  caused God
[2774.92 --> 2775.68]  to love us,
[2776.28 --> 2777.06]  that means nothing
[2777.06 --> 2778.36]  in us can cause
[2778.36 --> 2781.40]  losing that love.
[2782.58 --> 2784.00]  Nothing we can do,
[2784.96 --> 2786.12]  no sin we commit,
[2786.64 --> 2787.74]  can cause God
[2787.74 --> 2788.70]  to stop loving us.
[2788.86 --> 2789.54]  Because Jesus
[2789.54 --> 2790.16]  has already done
[2790.16 --> 2790.76]  everything
[2790.76 --> 2792.38]  so that we could
[2792.38 --> 2793.06]  be God's friend.
[2795.04 --> 2796.34]  Nothing can deter
[2796.34 --> 2797.54]  him from loving us
[2797.54 --> 2798.36]  in Jesus Christ.
[2798.48 --> 2799.04]  And so once you
[2799.04 --> 2799.72]  believe in Jesus,
[2800.12 --> 2801.00]  once you receive
[2801.00 --> 2802.26]  the gift of his love,
[2802.56 --> 2803.46]  you will always
[2803.46 --> 2804.32]  be God's friend.
[2806.08 --> 2806.86]  And now,
[2807.00 --> 2807.62]  that leads us
[2807.62 --> 2808.62]  to our third point.
[2810.02 --> 2811.22]  Because when Paul
[2811.22 --> 2812.58]  reflects on this,
[2812.66 --> 2813.42]  when he reflects
[2813.42 --> 2814.94]  on God's amazing
[2814.94 --> 2815.84]  love for us,
[2816.12 --> 2817.04]  when we were unworthy,
[2817.58 --> 2818.26]  when he reflects
[2818.26 --> 2819.22]  on how we can be
[2819.22 --> 2820.02]  confident
[2820.02 --> 2821.66]  in our salvation,
[2822.24 --> 2823.34]  that leads
[2823.34 --> 2824.66]  to a response.
[2824.98 --> 2825.36]  And what is
[2825.36 --> 2826.00]  the response?
[2826.34 --> 2827.34]  we can have
[2827.34 --> 2828.60]  joyful confidence
[2828.60 --> 2830.04]  in God.
[2830.44 --> 2831.34]  And we find that
[2831.34 --> 2832.10]  in the last verse
[2832.10 --> 2832.72]  of our passage
[2832.72 --> 2833.42]  in verse 11.
[2836.02 --> 2837.02]  Paul writes this,
[2837.72 --> 2838.92]  not only is this so,
[2840.20 --> 2841.08]  but we also
[2841.08 --> 2843.06]  boast in God
[2843.06 --> 2844.00]  through our Lord
[2844.00 --> 2844.76]  Jesus Christ,
[2844.88 --> 2845.54]  through whom
[2845.54 --> 2846.48]  we have now
[2846.48 --> 2847.70]  received reconciliation.
[2848.38 --> 2849.08]  So do you see
[2849.08 --> 2850.00]  that little word boast?
[2850.04 --> 2850.88]  When Peyton read it,
[2850.94 --> 2851.56]  what was the word?
[2851.68 --> 2852.14]  Did you hear?
[2852.14 --> 2852.64]  rejoice?
[2854.40 --> 2854.76]  Rejoice.
[2855.66 --> 2856.06]  Rejoice.
[2856.24 --> 2856.52]  Now,
[2856.76 --> 2857.96]  this is more accurate.
[2858.42 --> 2859.84]  The word below,
[2860.28 --> 2861.56]  the word rejoice,
[2861.76 --> 2862.76]  is actually to boast.
[2864.02 --> 2864.40]  Now,
[2864.52 --> 2864.86]  what do you,
[2864.96 --> 2865.56]  do you boast?
[2867.78 --> 2868.70]  What do you boast in?
[2869.24 --> 2869.84]  What do you
[2869.84 --> 2871.52]  feel happy about?
[2871.60 --> 2872.00]  What do you take
[2872.00 --> 2873.38]  confidence in?
[2873.38 --> 2876.10]  What it says here
[2876.10 --> 2877.42]  is that we can boast,
[2877.56 --> 2878.44]  we can rejoice
[2878.44 --> 2880.14]  because we are now
[2880.14 --> 2880.88]  friends with God.
[2881.66 --> 2882.14]  Right?
[2882.42 --> 2883.38]  We're happy
[2883.38 --> 2884.90]  that we
[2884.90 --> 2885.94]  call God
[2885.94 --> 2886.72]  our Heavenly Father.
[2887.46 --> 2888.64]  We are happy
[2888.64 --> 2889.74]  that we're going
[2889.74 --> 2890.24]  to heaven
[2890.24 --> 2891.00]  to be with Him.
[2891.18 --> 2892.00]  We are happy
[2892.00 --> 2893.32]  that He loves us.
[2893.32 --> 2894.38]  And so,
[2894.62 --> 2895.30]  for Paul,
[2895.54 --> 2896.62]  boasting in anything
[2896.62 --> 2897.24]  and anyone
[2897.24 --> 2898.58]  apart from God
[2898.58 --> 2899.52]  is called pride,
[2900.06 --> 2900.94]  but boasting
[2900.94 --> 2902.40]  and rejoicing
[2902.40 --> 2903.42]  in God
[2903.42 --> 2904.74]  is called faith.
[2905.76 --> 2906.90]  And it's where
[2906.90 --> 2907.66]  you place
[2907.66 --> 2908.56]  your confidence
[2908.56 --> 2910.16]  in life
[2910.16 --> 2911.84]  is what
[2911.84 --> 2912.92]  is important.
[2913.30 --> 2913.72]  Do you put
[2913.72 --> 2914.26]  your confidence
[2914.26 --> 2914.70]  in God?
[2914.86 --> 2915.54]  Because God
[2915.54 --> 2916.10]  has proven
[2916.10 --> 2916.78]  His love for you,
[2917.02 --> 2917.80]  He's assured you
[2917.80 --> 2918.60]  of your salvation,
[2919.38 --> 2920.36]  that you will be
[2920.36 --> 2921.46]  friends with God
[2921.46 --> 2922.04]  forever.
[2922.04 --> 2923.62]  Do you all still say
[2923.62 --> 2924.44]  that,
[2924.70 --> 2925.34]  like BFF?
[2926.08 --> 2927.12]  Best friends forever?
[2927.32 --> 2928.12]  Is that still a thing?
[2928.28 --> 2928.42]  Okay.
[2929.38 --> 2929.62]  Okay.
[2929.90 --> 2930.72]  If you remember
[2930.72 --> 2931.34]  one thing
[2931.34 --> 2932.58]  from this sermon today,
[2933.50 --> 2933.98]  BFF.
[2934.58 --> 2935.40]  You are God's
[2935.40 --> 2936.08]  best friend forever.
[2937.04 --> 2937.64]  That's it.
[2937.70 --> 2938.20]  That's what this
[2938.20 --> 2938.88]  is talking about.
[2939.00 --> 2939.10]  Okay?
[2941.50 --> 2942.38]  And now,
[2942.50 --> 2943.00]  because you're
[2943.00 --> 2943.38]  best friends
[2943.38 --> 2944.06]  with God forever,
[2944.66 --> 2945.38]  God says,
[2945.92 --> 2946.96]  will you boast in me?
[2947.40 --> 2948.54]  Will you have confidence?
[2948.66 --> 2949.36]  Will you have joy
[2949.36 --> 2950.48]  in me?
[2950.72 --> 2951.82]  Because you're my friend.
[2952.48 --> 2953.56]  Because of His love,
[2953.98 --> 2954.88]  we can boast in God.
[2955.60 --> 2955.88]  Now,
[2956.04 --> 2956.70]  the thing is,
[2956.84 --> 2958.18]  do we boast in God?
[2958.36 --> 2959.40]  Do we have confidence
[2959.40 --> 2960.56]  in God?
[2961.60 --> 2963.06]  It's an important question
[2963.06 --> 2964.16]  because
[2964.16 --> 2966.20]  there are lots
[2966.20 --> 2967.04]  of other things
[2967.04 --> 2968.16]  that we can boast in.
[2969.36 --> 2969.60]  You know,
[2969.66 --> 2971.04]  sometimes we think that,
[2971.58 --> 2971.72]  well,
[2971.78 --> 2972.84]  we do have confidence
[2972.84 --> 2973.70]  in God because,
[2974.74 --> 2975.66]  but it's more,
[2976.50 --> 2977.58]  not just that we have
[2977.58 --> 2978.40]  confidence in God,
[2978.40 --> 2979.28]  but we have confidence
[2979.28 --> 2980.58]  confidence in how
[2980.58 --> 2981.86]  I live for God
[2981.86 --> 2983.48]  or what I have done
[2983.48 --> 2984.22]  for God.
[2984.88 --> 2985.14]  So like,
[2985.24 --> 2985.38]  Lord,
[2985.64 --> 2985.98]  you know,
[2986.06 --> 2986.70]  I've been faithfully
[2986.70 --> 2987.56]  attending this church
[2987.56 --> 2988.40]  for 50 years,
[2988.40 --> 2989.60]  right?
[2990.68 --> 2991.58]  So is,
[2991.66 --> 2991.90]  is,
[2992.02 --> 2992.26]  are your,
[2992.32 --> 2992.88]  is your confidence
[2992.88 --> 2993.38]  in that?
[2994.16 --> 2994.68]  Or,
[2994.84 --> 2995.68]  I have been going
[2995.68 --> 2997.28]  to Gems for five years.
[2998.38 --> 2999.66]  That's what I boast in.
[3000.46 --> 3001.36]  That's how I know
[3001.36 --> 3002.10]  God loves me,
[3002.10 --> 3003.24]  right?
[3003.98 --> 3005.30]  But what if you get sick
[3005.30 --> 3006.06]  and you can't attend?
[3008.68 --> 3009.54]  Where's your confidence?
[3010.60 --> 3011.02]  Is it,
[3011.14 --> 3012.10]  if it's just in going
[3012.10 --> 3012.60]  to Gems,
[3012.72 --> 3013.66]  then maybe your confidence
[3013.66 --> 3014.44]  feels a little shaky.
[3014.52 --> 3015.02]  I don't know
[3015.02 --> 3016.92]  if I'm good with God.
[3018.52 --> 3018.88]  But,
[3019.02 --> 3019.76]  if your confidence
[3019.76 --> 3020.68]  is in what God
[3020.68 --> 3021.68]  has done for you,
[3022.38 --> 3023.52]  even if you're sick
[3023.52 --> 3024.38]  and you can't go to Gems,
[3024.48 --> 3025.42]  you still are confident.
[3025.56 --> 3026.22]  Does that make sense?
[3027.14 --> 3027.38]  Yeah?
[3027.54 --> 3027.78]  Okay.
[3030.06 --> 3031.12]  How can you know
[3031.12 --> 3031.64]  what you're putting
[3031.64 --> 3032.48]  your confidence in?
[3033.24 --> 3034.20]  Here's a test.
[3035.34 --> 3036.10]  If that thing
[3036.10 --> 3037.44]  is taken away from you,
[3038.08 --> 3038.60]  if that thing
[3038.60 --> 3039.18]  is threatened
[3039.18 --> 3040.02]  in your life
[3040.02 --> 3041.16]  and your confidence
[3041.16 --> 3042.14]  begins to crack
[3042.14 --> 3042.76]  and crumble,
[3043.20 --> 3044.08]  that's what you're
[3044.08 --> 3045.10]  putting your confidence in.
[3045.76 --> 3045.92]  Right?
[3046.02 --> 3046.30]  So,
[3046.80 --> 3048.34]  what if your confidence
[3048.34 --> 3049.52]  is in what people
[3049.52 --> 3050.16]  think of you?
[3051.12 --> 3051.90]  So at school,
[3052.74 --> 3053.18]  maybe,
[3053.78 --> 3054.94]  your confidence
[3054.94 --> 3056.48]  is in what other kids
[3056.48 --> 3057.38]  think of you.
[3058.22 --> 3058.84]  And if someone
[3058.84 --> 3060.04]  is mean to you,
[3060.92 --> 3062.04]  if you suddenly
[3062.04 --> 3062.88]  lose your confidence,
[3062.88 --> 3063.62]  if you feel like
[3063.62 --> 3064.48]  your world is crumbling,
[3064.92 --> 3065.60]  then maybe what
[3065.60 --> 3066.48]  you're putting your confidence
[3066.48 --> 3067.36]  is not in God,
[3067.44 --> 3068.50]  but in popularity.
[3069.66 --> 3069.84]  Okay?
[3070.52 --> 3070.92]  Or,
[3071.24 --> 3072.94]  if you put your confidence
[3072.94 --> 3073.78]  in having a certain
[3073.78 --> 3074.58]  amount of money
[3074.58 --> 3075.82]  in the bank account,
[3076.20 --> 3077.00]  as soon as that money
[3077.00 --> 3077.90]  is no longer there
[3077.90 --> 3079.16]  or is no longer guaranteed,
[3079.88 --> 3080.68]  your confidence
[3080.68 --> 3081.26]  will be shaken
[3081.26 --> 3081.78]  to the core.
[3083.16 --> 3084.30]  There's lots of things
[3084.30 --> 3085.68]  that we put our confidence in,
[3086.04 --> 3087.10]  but God wants us
[3087.10 --> 3088.06]  to put our confidence,
[3088.06 --> 3088.36]  confidence,
[3088.80 --> 3090.96]  he wants our hearts
[3090.96 --> 3092.84]  to be tethered
[3092.84 --> 3094.38]  to the cross
[3094.38 --> 3095.58]  of Jesus Christ.
[3096.32 --> 3097.34]  So here's a picture
[3097.34 --> 3097.96]  of a ship.
[3098.60 --> 3099.92]  I got this from Gary Rosema,
[3100.08 --> 3100.84]  who is the
[3100.84 --> 3101.98]  seafarer's chaplain.
[3102.94 --> 3103.64]  And so,
[3103.80 --> 3104.74]  what we see here
[3104.74 --> 3105.56]  is a ship
[3105.56 --> 3106.96]  that has come
[3106.96 --> 3108.52]  to the port.
[3108.84 --> 3110.24]  And when it stops
[3110.24 --> 3111.30]  and it kind of parks,
[3111.34 --> 3112.42]  like you park your car,
[3112.70 --> 3113.64]  but it's parked
[3113.64 --> 3114.22]  at the port,
[3114.72 --> 3115.68]  it has to put out
[3115.68 --> 3116.80]  these mooring lines,
[3116.80 --> 3117.74]  they're called mooring lines.
[3117.78 --> 3118.50]  And you see the big one
[3118.50 --> 3118.98]  right there,
[3119.08 --> 3120.32]  but there's one on the left,
[3120.40 --> 3121.28]  there's one in the back,
[3121.40 --> 3123.48]  and this ship gets tied down.
[3123.88 --> 3124.24]  Why?
[3124.94 --> 3125.62]  Well, because
[3125.62 --> 3127.12]  the water moves,
[3127.20 --> 3128.18]  it might drift away,
[3128.28 --> 3129.62]  or it might become wavy,
[3129.92 --> 3130.76]  or the wind,
[3130.86 --> 3131.58]  or the currents
[3131.58 --> 3132.62]  might carry it away.
[3134.22 --> 3135.48]  And when we know
[3135.48 --> 3136.72]  the love of God for us,
[3136.84 --> 3137.76]  when we are assured
[3137.76 --> 3138.62]  of our salvation,
[3138.80 --> 3139.76]  we can have
[3139.76 --> 3141.50]  these mooring lines,
[3141.58 --> 3142.28]  this joy,
[3142.92 --> 3144.34]  knowing that we are secure,
[3144.96 --> 3146.72]  that we are friends with God,
[3146.80 --> 3148.20]  and that becomes
[3148.20 --> 3148.92]  then the anchor
[3148.92 --> 3150.42]  of our souls.
[3154.16 --> 3155.26]  Now I want us to think
[3155.26 --> 3156.52]  about one point of application
[3156.52 --> 3158.02]  as we come to an end.
[3159.30 --> 3161.30]  Here is the question for us.
[3162.96 --> 3164.02]  Well, here it is.
[3164.12 --> 3164.66]  So first,
[3165.52 --> 3166.56]  how does God make us
[3166.56 --> 3167.00]  his friend?
[3168.38 --> 3169.62]  Well, he shows love
[3169.62 --> 3170.70]  to an enemy, right?
[3170.76 --> 3171.62]  Isn't that how God did it?
[3172.22 --> 3172.74]  That was the point
[3172.74 --> 3173.34]  of this passage.
[3173.58 --> 3174.80]  God made us his friend
[3174.80 --> 3176.76]  by showing his love
[3176.76 --> 3178.48]  to his enemy.
[3179.72 --> 3180.86]  Even while we were
[3180.86 --> 3181.70]  enemies of God,
[3181.84 --> 3182.88]  God sought us out,
[3183.30 --> 3184.08]  he loved us,
[3184.12 --> 3184.98]  he died for us,
[3185.14 --> 3186.18]  and he made us his friend.
[3187.06 --> 3188.30]  Now, what is the application?
[3190.24 --> 3191.22]  It's pretty obvious,
[3191.30 --> 3191.76]  I think.
[3192.76 --> 3194.08]  When was the last time
[3194.08 --> 3194.88]  you showed love
[3194.88 --> 3195.40]  to an enemy?
[3195.40 --> 3199.50]  For all of us.
[3201.06 --> 3201.26]  Right?
[3201.32 --> 3203.16]  Not someone who is nice to you,
[3203.68 --> 3205.36]  not someone who is attractive
[3205.36 --> 3206.16]  to you in some way,
[3206.24 --> 3207.76]  not someone who is worthy
[3207.76 --> 3209.32]  or can repay you,
[3209.56 --> 3210.82]  but someone who is an enemy.
[3212.98 --> 3213.40]  Girls,
[3213.48 --> 3214.58]  do you have enemies at school?
[3214.58 --> 3218.78]  I've heard
[3218.78 --> 3221.84]  that everyone,
[3222.30 --> 3223.62]  sometimes it can be this way,
[3223.66 --> 3224.80]  that everyone kind of feels
[3224.80 --> 3225.26]  like they're enemies
[3225.26 --> 3225.98]  with everyone else.
[3226.76 --> 3227.16]  Maybe.
[3227.58 --> 3228.66]  Or you have little groups.
[3228.76 --> 3229.76]  You have got three girls here,
[3229.88 --> 3230.64]  you have three girls there,
[3230.74 --> 3231.34]  this and that,
[3232.04 --> 3232.82]  this club,
[3232.90 --> 3233.44]  that club,
[3233.56 --> 3234.22]  this friend group,
[3234.30 --> 3235.04]  and then everyone else
[3235.04 --> 3235.48]  is enemies.
[3237.48 --> 3238.28]  Maybe somewhat.
[3239.42 --> 3240.98]  But what is amazing,
[3241.34 --> 3242.52]  what is out of the ordinary,
[3242.52 --> 3244.20]  is when you go show love
[3244.20 --> 3246.16]  to someone who isn't expecting it,
[3246.88 --> 3248.42]  who is not part of your friend group,
[3248.56 --> 3249.88]  who is outside of that group.
[3252.68 --> 3254.42]  Someone who is not expecting you
[3254.42 --> 3255.96]  to show kindness and love to them.
[3257.64 --> 3258.58]  And so for all of us,
[3258.64 --> 3260.60]  think about when is the last time
[3260.60 --> 3261.86]  you actually went out of your way
[3261.86 --> 3262.74]  to show love
[3262.74 --> 3264.64]  to someone who is an enemy.
[3267.02 --> 3268.34]  Why would we do that?
[3268.34 --> 3270.90]  Because that's what God does.
[3272.52 --> 3274.24]  That's why you are here.
[3275.16 --> 3276.98]  Because God showed love
[3276.98 --> 3277.84]  to an enemy.
[3278.84 --> 3280.26]  You are an enemy of God
[3280.26 --> 3281.78]  and God has made you his friend.
[3283.72 --> 3284.38]  And friends,
[3284.50 --> 3286.28]  if you are here this morning
[3286.28 --> 3288.06]  and you do not yet know God
[3288.06 --> 3288.66]  as your friend,
[3289.58 --> 3290.70]  the good news is that
[3290.70 --> 3291.90]  this gift is for you as well.
[3292.26 --> 3293.04]  And it's not a gift
[3293.04 --> 3293.94]  because you are worthy.
[3294.68 --> 3296.24]  But you are the most unworthy,
[3296.40 --> 3297.86]  but God has given you his best.
[3297.86 --> 3299.60]  And it doesn't require anything
[3299.60 --> 3300.52]  from you,
[3300.62 --> 3302.24]  but simply to receive his love.
[3302.52 --> 3303.96]  And to receive his welcome.
[3304.54 --> 3305.66]  And you can do that.
[3306.66 --> 3307.74]  So let's pray together.
[3310.64 --> 3311.44]  Heavenly Father,
[3311.54 --> 3312.58]  we thank you for your word.
[3313.06 --> 3313.90]  We thank you, Lord,
[3313.94 --> 3314.70]  for your love.
[3315.42 --> 3316.98]  It's an astounding love.
[3317.08 --> 3317.96]  It's a love that
[3317.96 --> 3319.18]  we almost don't even
[3319.18 --> 3320.26]  have a category for.
[3322.16 --> 3323.12]  We can understand
[3323.12 --> 3324.14]  that someone would love
[3324.14 --> 3325.18]  a righteous person
[3325.18 --> 3325.90]  or a good person,
[3325.90 --> 3327.06]  but Lord, you loved us
[3327.06 --> 3328.72]  even while we were sinners.
[3329.72 --> 3330.92]  And Lord, because of that,
[3331.00 --> 3332.98]  give us a confident joy in you
[3332.98 --> 3334.86]  that it would be an anchor
[3334.86 --> 3336.20]  for our souls.
[3336.80 --> 3337.78]  We pray, Lord,
[3337.88 --> 3341.86]  that though we might not be
[3341.86 --> 3342.82]  everybody's friend,
[3343.36 --> 3344.22]  we thank you, Lord,
[3344.28 --> 3345.00]  that we are friends
[3345.00 --> 3345.68]  with you forever.
[3347.18 --> 3348.50]  And may that change
[3348.50 --> 3349.72]  the way we live in this world
[3349.72 --> 3351.48]  as we try to love our enemies
[3351.48 --> 3352.62]  in the same way
[3352.62 --> 3353.58]  that you have loved us.
[3354.10 --> 3355.30]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[3355.66 --> 3355.90]  Amen.
[3359.58 --> 3361.78]  So we'll prepare to stand
[3361.78 --> 3363.08]  and sing our song of response.
[3363.08 --> 3363.22]  Amen.
[3363.22 --> 3363.58]  Amen.
[3385.30 --> 3387.00]  Amen.
[3387.00 --> 3387.86]  Amen.
[3387.92 --> 3390.06]  When we act on
[3390.06 --> 3392.18]  His name is
[3392.24 --> 3394.32]  Redrada,
[3394.76 --> 3395.08]  our revival meres,
[3395.16 --> 3395.30]  our seed,
[3395.50 --> 3397.52]  our sow
[3397.52 --> 3399.52]  The Family tingens
[3399.52 --> 3400.68]  That everyone
[3400.68 --> 3401.20]  has incredible
[3401.20 --> 3402.06]  Our dive in
[3402.06 --> 3402.08]  our strife
[3402.08 --> 3403.18]  and the outcome
[3403.18 --> 3404.06]  for the world
[3404.06 --> 3405.10]  He must have filled
[3405.10 --> 3406.12]  His pain
[3406.12 --> 3408.12]  To this I hold
[3408.12 --> 3410.12]  My hope is only
[3410.12 --> 3411.22]  Jesus
[3411.22 --> 3414.60]  For my life
[3414.60 --> 3419.08]  is
[3419.08 --> 3423.08]  oh how strange and divine i can sing
[3423.08 --> 3428.60]  all is

[3450.60 --> 3456.60]  i lay her on in weakness and rejoicing
[3456.60 --> 3462.60]  for in my need his power is to sway
[3462.60 --> 3468.76]  to this i hold my children will defend me
[3468.76 --> 3474.76]  through the deepest valley he will lead
[3474.76 --> 3478.76]  all the night has been gone
[3478.76 --> 3480.76]  and i shall overcome
[3480.76 --> 3482.76]  and i am not
[3482.76 --> 3486.76]  but through christ to me
[3486.76 --> 3496.76]  i know

[3500.76 --> 3502.76]  my future sure
[3502.76 --> 3506.76]  the price it has been paid
[3506.76 --> 3508.76]  jesus
[3508.76 --> 3512.76]  and suffered for my pardon
[3512.76 --> 3516.76]  and he was raised to overthrow the grave
[3516.76 --> 3518.76]  to this i hope
[3518.76 --> 3522.76]  my sin has been defeated
[3522.76 --> 3524.76]  jesus now
[3524.76 --> 3528.76]  whenever is my prayer
[3528.76 --> 3530.76]  oh the chains are released

[3836.94 --> 3839.78]  thanks to our gems, girls and counselors,
[3840.04 --> 3841.96]  for their part in this worship service.
[3842.54 --> 3845.12]  And I wanted to make a comment about these flowers.
[3846.04 --> 3847.22]  They're stunning.
[3847.96 --> 3848.48]  Beautiful.
[3852.08 --> 3854.26]  We would like to inform the congregation
[3854.26 --> 3857.28]  that Art Hoekstra's brother, Andy Hoekstra,
[3857.46 --> 3860.62]  passed away at Richmond Hospital on Thursday evening.
[3861.72 --> 3864.40]  Andy, who was 83 and a resident of Richmond,
[3865.04 --> 3866.72]  had been ill for quite a while
[3866.72 --> 3870.54]  and had become bedridden in the last couple of months.
[3871.60 --> 3873.90]  He has now been taken into glory.
[3877.62 --> 3880.58]  You may have heard of a horrific occurrence.
[3882.44 --> 3883.08]  Sorry.
[3883.08 --> 3883.72]  Sorry.
[3890.72 --> 3893.70]  That took place last night in East Vancouver.
[3894.64 --> 3899.86]  The Filipino community staged a significant cultural event there.
[3899.86 --> 3905.42]  A person driving an SUV deliberately drove...
[3909.42 --> 3914.12]  drove into the crowd.
[3914.12 --> 3924.68]  At this time, 11 deaths have been reported, with many in critical condition and others sustaining other injuries.
[3925.68 --> 3926.64]  We will pray.
[3932.74 --> 3933.88]  I'm sorry.
[3936.02 --> 3938.14]  We will pray for this community.
[3944.12 --> 3946.46]  Let's pray.
[3954.32 --> 3958.78]  Our gracious and loving Heavenly Father, Psalm 19 says,
[3958.78 --> 3965.06]  May the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in your sight.
[3967.22 --> 3973.82]  O Lord, our Rock and Redeemer, we praise you because you are a God who hears our prayers,
[3974.68 --> 3979.50]  Thank you that we can have confidence in you, best friends forever.
[3980.90 --> 3984.76]  We thank you that we can meet as a body of believers here in Ladner.
[3988.22 --> 3990.50]  We are privileged to meet in freedom.
[3992.00 --> 3996.50]  We pray that we may be salt and light in our homes and communities and workplaces.
[3998.06 --> 4000.48]  May we reflect your light in our lives.
[4000.48 --> 4004.88]  We pray for your spirit to lead our lives and those we interact with.
[4005.66 --> 4010.58]  Give us guidance as we deal with the shifts in the cultural and moral landscape around us.
[4011.26 --> 4015.72]  Teach us how to live as people in exile, loving those around us.
[4015.72 --> 4023.26]  We continue to hear about violence, wars, and terrorism around the globe.
[4024.02 --> 4027.78]  Our world economy is in turmoil and uncertainty reigns.
[4028.44 --> 4032.40]  Grant wisdom to all leaders as they address these complex issues.
[4032.40 --> 4041.44]  May each of us pray for peace where it is needed, justice where the helpless cry out, and aid for the needy.
[4043.18 --> 4048.26]  We pray for Christians in countries where Christianity is banned and Christians are persecuted.
[4049.10 --> 4050.76]  Protect these believers, Lord.
[4050.76 --> 4059.90]  Heavenly Father, we are shocked and dismayed by this horrific tragedy within the Filipino community of the Vancouver area.
[4060.68 --> 4066.52]  We lift this entire community up to you, especially those families who lost loved ones.
[4067.24 --> 4068.76]  Those in critical condition.
[4069.64 --> 4071.28]  Those suffering other injuries.
[4072.54 --> 4074.04]  Protect this community.
[4075.04 --> 4079.86]  We pray for the doctors, nurses, and police personnel dealing with this tragedy.
[4079.86 --> 4083.74]  Once again, we see the brokenness of this world.
[4084.60 --> 4086.76]  This evil is too much to take in.
[4087.96 --> 4089.96]  Lord Jesus, come quickly.
[4092.84 --> 4094.92]  Tomorrow is election day in Canada.
[4095.58 --> 4098.90]  As we vote, may we be mindful of your call for justice,
[4099.18 --> 4102.56]  to stand up for the marginalized, to promote good order,
[4103.18 --> 4106.06]  so that your intentions for good government may be fulfilled.
[4106.06 --> 4111.10]  We pray that the sovereignty of Canada may be protected.
[4112.16 --> 4117.72]  We pray for the leadership in our church, for our council, Pastor Nancy and Pastor Jason,
[4117.92 --> 4119.58]  and for many ministries here.
[4119.58 --> 4124.34]  We pray for those in missions connected with our church,
[4124.34 --> 4127.40]  for Gary Rosema in his work with seafarers,
[4127.92 --> 4131.64]  the Johnson families working with First Nations in the Salmon Arm area,
[4132.02 --> 4134.50]  and for the Amran family in Egypt.
[4135.28 --> 4138.90]  Bless all these efforts so that your kingdom may be advanced.
[4138.90 --> 4142.86]  We pray, too, for Pastor Nancy and her husband, Stephen,
[4142.86 --> 4147.74]  as they go to a CRC event called The Gathering in Iowa this week.
[4148.40 --> 4151.50]  May they be richly blessed as they bless others there.
[4153.14 --> 4155.18]  Thank you, Lord, for our GEMS ministry.
[4155.44 --> 4157.56]  Thank you for each counselor and each girl.
[4157.90 --> 4162.56]  May they know you and be reminded that they are seen, known, and loved.
[4163.54 --> 4166.64]  Within our own congregation, there are many needs.
[4166.64 --> 4169.88]  We pray, especially, for Michael Wayne, his family,
[4170.04 --> 4174.96]  and his community of Bethesda in Richmond as he struggles with lymphatic lymphoma.
[4176.04 --> 4180.84]  We pray, too, for those among us who need your presence in their lives in a special way.
[4181.46 --> 4188.24]  Pat Bauman, Ellie Bixma, Carl Geronimus, Shirley Rass, Eileen Rideout,
[4188.74 --> 4194.56]  Diane Schmidt, Hank, and Liz Van Beek, Ted Vanderhorst, and Tani Winja.
[4194.56 --> 4202.24]  We pray, too, for wisdom and strength for all caregivers, nurses, and doctors attending these friends.
[4203.96 --> 4209.86]  Bless the Hoekstra family, especially Art, as they mourn the death of Andy, Art's brother.
[4210.56 --> 4214.48]  May each of them know your presence and love in this loss.
[4214.48 --> 4221.22]  Grant that the memorial service for Jerry and Ann Cron may bring comfort to the Cron family
[4221.22 --> 4227.16]  and the assurance of your grace as Jerry and Ann are fondly remembered and celebrated.
[4229.22 --> 4233.76]  Be near to those with unseen hurts, those with broken relationships,
[4234.00 --> 4238.52]  those who are lonely, those who are in mourning, those with addictions.
[4238.52 --> 4242.74]  May we be a supportive community for those in need.
[4243.82 --> 4247.50]  Gracious God, accept this prayer offered in Jesus' name
[4247.50 --> 4253.42]  and give us the strength to wait patiently for your answer,
[4255.06 --> 4259.36]  to live faithfully in response to your call.
[4260.32 --> 4261.56]  Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[4262.20 --> 4263.72]  It is in his name we pray.
[4264.48 --> 4264.78]  Amen.
[4264.78 --> 4264.92]  Amen.
[4268.52 --> 4269.52]  Thank you.
[4286.74 --> 4288.26]  Bev, thank you for leading us in that prayer.

[4292.90 --> 4301.72]  And please do join us for a time of fellowship and coffee through the fellowship doors right out there.
[4302.14 --> 4306.34]  Thank you again to our gems for leading us in worship today as well.
[4306.90 --> 4309.18]  And we go out with the Lord's blessing upon us.
[4309.92 --> 4312.68]  I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[4313.56 --> 4318.62]  To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence
[4318.62 --> 4320.62]  without fault and with great joy.
[4321.14 --> 4325.36]  To the only God, our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[4325.36 --> 4329.74]  through Jesus Christ our Lord before all ages, now and forevermore.
[4330.02 --> 4330.34]  Amen.
