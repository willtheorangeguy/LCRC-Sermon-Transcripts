• Lent is a season in the church calendar where attention is turned to the suffering and death of Jesus Christ for salvation
• The book of Lamentations will be studied during Lent, which tells the story of Jerusalem's destruction by the Babylonian Empire
• Lamentations is composed of five poems written in response to this tragedy, each using the Hebrew alphabet as an acrostic
• The book teaches that even in chaos, all things are under God's providential ordering
• Lamentations deals with communal suffering and teaches how crying out to God in grief and sorrow is a crucial part of the faith journey
• Lament is speaking raw and honest confusion, sorrow, and pain to God in hopes of healing
• Lament is a form of protest calling on God to see and pay attention to suffering that should not be happening
• The difference between lament and grumbling
• Lament is a genuine expression of sorrow and confusion, while grumbling has already reached a conclusion and is an accusation
• True Christian lament is characterized by open-ended questions, such as "How long, O Lord?" rather than accusations or statements about God's intentions
• Lament moves towards God with its questions, rather than away from Him
• The book of Lamentations is read to illustrate this concept, describing the suffering and despair of Jerusalem in vivid detail.

• Zion (another name for Jerusalem) lies deserted, with worship silenced and roads empty
• Suffering and exile have led to loneliness and despair
• "Splendor" or God's glory has departed from Zion, indicating God's withdrawal
• Betrayal and lack of comfort in times of need, as seen in verse 2 of Lamentations chapter 1
• No help was given in the wake of Jerusalem's destruction, unlike modern-day disasters where aid pours in
• The book of Lamentations places blame squarely on those responsible for the suffering
• The suffering of Israel is a result of their sin
• God uses the metaphor of husband to his bride to describe his relationship with his people
• Israel's betrayal of God led to their downfall through their unfaithfulness and seeking help from other nations and gods
• Jeremiah invites listeners to reflect on whether they have done the same thing, looking to false lovers for security and comfort
• The message of chapter 1 is that we are meant for only one lover, the one true God
• Even in suffering, we can hope because God is a God of steadfast love and faithfulness
• Jeremiah's lament, directed at both people and God, expresses his pain and seeks answers
• The passage from Lamentations 1:12 is relevant to Jesus' experience on the cross, highlighting his suffering and sorrow.
• Jesus embodied our lament and answered our cries in himself by suffering for us.
• God's response to human suffering is not explanation or rationalization, but rather presence with himself.
• Christian suffering and lament involve sharing in Christ's pain and prayers being answered through him.
• As Christians, we should be people who have tears and express them in worship and the world.
• Lament is a communal experience that should be shared among believers, both in private devotion and in corporate worship.
