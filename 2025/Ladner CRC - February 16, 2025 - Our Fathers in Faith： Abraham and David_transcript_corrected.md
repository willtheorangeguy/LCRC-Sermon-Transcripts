[0.00 → 2.00] Santi
[2.00 → 21.92] N
[21.92 → 51.90] Thank you.
[51.92 → 81.90] Thank you.
[82.30 → 86.70] It's good to be together. We had a good run there with blue skies, didn't we?
[87.80 → 89.08] Now we're back to rain.
[90.00 → 94.02] Welcome. Welcome to all present and those joining us via live stream.
[94.76 → 98.48] My name is BEV Mantra and I will be leading our worship service.
[98.64 → 103.14] And Pastor Jason True will be preaching God's word to us later in the service.
[104.10 → 109.96] Just one announcement. You're all invited to have coffee in the fellowship hall with us after church.
[110.06 → 111.68] We'd love to meet you if you're a visitor.
[111.68 → 120.54] Our call to worship comes to us from Psalm 100.
[121.54 → 126.42] Join me in this reading where indicated with double arrows.
[126.42 → 130.90] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[131.80 → 137.28] The Lord with gladness. Come before him with joyful songs.
[137.28 → 143.32] Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us and we are his.
[144.12 → 147.76] We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[148.94 → 153.02] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[153.88 → 156.90] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[156.90 → 162.10] For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[162.70 → 166.64] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[169.04 → 171.36] This is our prayer for adoration.
[171.60 → 173.20] Please join me in praying.
[175.18 → 177.54] God, you reign.
[178.92 → 181.60] Robed in majesty and armed with strength,
[181.60 → 186.08] you hold our world and our lives securely.
[187.18 → 190.32] Your throne has stood for all eternity.
[191.02 → 195.66] From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[196.34 → 198.32] Even when the waters rise up,
[198.76 → 202.00] when surging seas threaten to overwhelm us
[202.00 → 204.86] and pounding waves crash around us,
[205.22 → 207.54] we know that you are mightier.
[207.54 → 212.36] You are more powerful than the threats we face.
[213.28 → 217.72] Holy God, your decrees are firm and unshakeable
[217.72 → 220.46] and will last forevermore.
[221.42 → 221.84] Amen.
[223.52 → 227.00] If you are able, please stand for the Lord's greeting.
[231.66 → 234.18] Our Lord greets us with these words.
[234.18 → 237.14] To those who are called,
[237.72 → 239.72] who are beloved in God the Father
[239.72 → 242.88] and kept safe in Jesus Christ,
[243.50 → 247.80] may mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[249.62 → 251.10] God has greeted us.
[251.20 → 252.32] Let us greet one another.
[252.32 → 252.44] Amen.
[252.44 → 252.48] Amen.
[264.18 → 265.18] Amen.
[294.18 → 296.18] Amen.
[296.18 → 297.18] Amen.
[315.66 → 316.16] Amen.
[316.16 → 321.16] All the worry
[321.16 → 325.16] Come to the fountain
[325.16 → 329.16] And without endless rain
[329.16 → 333.16] Of love, the sin and the sorrow
[333.16 → 337.16] He washed away
[337.16 → 341.16] Through the waves of His mercy
[341.16 → 347.16] As He was loved to do
[347.16 → 349.16] We sing
[349.16 → 353.16] Come Lord Jesus
[353.16 → 361.16] Come Lord Jesus
[361.16 → 367.16] Come Lord Jesus
[367.16 → 373.16] Come Lord Jesus
[373.16 → 377.16] Come Lord Jesus
[377.16 → 379.16] Come Lord Jesus
[379.16 → 381.16] Come
[381.16 → 385.16] Through the steam
[385.16 → 387.16] All who are with
[387.16 → 389.16] Up through the mountain
[389.16 → 393.16] Up through the mountain
[393.16 → 397.16] To avoid the stream of wind
[397.16 → 401.16] Of the pain and the sorrow
[401.16 → 405.16] He washed away
[405.16 → 409.16] Through the waves of His mercy
[409.16 → 415.16] Of the bright hands to be
[415.16 → 421.16] Holy Spirit God
[421.16 → 429.16] Holy Spirit God
[429.16 → 439.16] Holy Spirit God
[439.16 → 443.16] Holy Spirit God
[443.16 → 447.16] Holy Spirit God
[447.16 → 449.16] As He 비� Estes
[449.16 → 453.16] As He tine
[453.16 → 455.16] As Hebrides
[455.16 → 459.16] As He data
[459.16 → 462.08] As He
[462.08 → 463.78] As He
[463.78 → 467.82] As He
[467.82 → 472.18] As He brought
[472.18 → 474.16] As Head
[474.16 → 477.14] As Heُ Republican
[477.14 → 493.12] O God, before the mountains we brought forth,
[493.12 → 499.12] For days of spring and summer filled the earth,
[499.12 → 509.12] From everlasting you are God.
[512.12 → 517.12] We dwell beneath the stars and ancient skies,
[517.12 → 523.12] A thousand years are nothing in your sight,
[523.12 → 532.12] From everlasting you are God.
[533.12 → 538.12] If all our days are lifted in your hands,
[539.12 → 544.12] The perfect love and favour have no end,
[545.12 → 550.12] We rest within the wisdom of your plan,
[550.12 → 555.12] Everlasting God.
[565.12 → 570.12] O God, when joy and tragedy collide,
[571.12 → 575.12] And lost in my touch, life is but a sigh,
[575.12 → 584.12] From everlasting you are God.
[585.12 → 590.12] And all our days are happening in your hands,
[591.12 → 596.12] Your perfect love and favour have no end,
[596.12 → 602.12] We rest within the wisdom of your plan,
[603.12 → 608.12] Everlasting God.
[608.12 → 622.12] O God of light, our lives are known to you,
[623.12 → 629.12] But by your grace you'll make you all the truth,
[629.12 → 634.12] So satisfy us in our number of days,
[634.12 → 639.12] Establish every effort while we wait,
[640.12 → 648.12] From everlasting you are God.
[648.12 → 650.12] And all our days are held within your hands,
[650.12 → 655.12] And all our days are held within your hands,
[655.12 → 660.12] Your perfect love and favour have no end,
[661.12 → 666.12] We rest within the wisdom of your plan,
[667.12 → 669.12] Everlasting.
[669.12 → 670.12] O God of light, our lives are known to you,
[670.12 → 675.12] And all our days are held within your hands,
[675.12 → 681.12] Your perfect love and favour have no end,
[682.12 → 686.12] We rest within the wisdom of your plan,
[686.12 → 694.12] Everlasting God.
[694.12 → 699.12] You may be seated.
[699.12 → 720.12] Our Old Testament scripture reading this morning is from Genesis 12,
[720.12 → 724.12] Verses 1 to 4,
[725.12 → 729.12] And Genesis 15, verses 1 through 6.
[730.12 → 732.12] The call of Abram.
[734.12 → 736.12] The Lord said to Abram,
[737.12 → 740.12] Go from your country, your people, and your father's household to the land,
[741.12 → 742.12] I will show you.
[743.12 → 746.12] I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you.
[746.12 → 751.12] I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
[752.12 → 757.12] I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you, I will curse.
[758.12 → 761.12] And all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.
[762.12 → 765.12] So Abraham went, and as the Lord had told him,
[766.12 → 768.12] And Lot went with him.
[769.12 → 773.12] Abram was 75 years old when he set out from Harlan.
[773.12 → 780.12] After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision.
[781.12 → 783.12] Do not be afraid, Abram.
[783.12 → 787.12] I am your shield, your very great reward.
[788.12 → 794.12] But Abram said, Sovereign Lord, what can you give me, since I remain childless,
[794.12 → 799.12] and the one who will inherit my estate is Eleazar of Damascus.
[800.12 → 803.12] And Abram said, You have given me no children.
[804.12 → 806.12] So a servant in my household will be my heir.
[807.12 → 809.12] Then the word of the Lord came to him.
[810.12 → 817.12] This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.
[817.12 → 826.12] He took him outside and said, Look up at the sky and count the stars, if indeed you can count them.
[827.12 → 832.12] Then he said to him, So shall your offspring be.
[833.12 → 839.12] Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.
[839.12 → 842.12] This is the word of the Lord.
[842.12 → 844.12] Thank you, Lord.
[848.12 → 855.12] Please join in this prayer of confession, reading aloud at the double arrows.
[855.12 → 866.12] Merciful God, we confess that we have not always lived up to the example set by your Son, Jesus Christ.
[867.12 → 870.12] In your mercy, hear our prayer of confession.
[873.12 → 877.12] We confess how difficult it is to truly love the people around us,
[878.12 → 882.12] to care as deeply for their well-being as for our own,
[882.12 → 886.12] to delight in their good fortune without feeling envious.
[887.12 → 888.12] Forgive us.
[889.12 → 892.12] Teach us to wholeheartedly love one another.
[893.12 → 898.12] We confess how often we act out of our own self-interest,
[899.12 → 902.12] putting our needs and desires ahead of the needs of others,
[903.12 → 907.12] hoarding our resources rather than sharing them freely.
[908.12 → 909.12] Forgive us.
[909.12 → 910.12] Forgive us.
[910.12 → 914.12] Teach us to live with generosity and compassion.
[915.12 → 919.12] We confess how easy it is to do what we know is wrong,
[920.12 → 924.12] to rationalize our bad decisions and behaviours,
[925.12 → 929.12] to make excuses for our hurtful words and actions.
[930.12 → 931.12] Forgive us.
[932.12 → 937.12] Teach us to turn away from what is wrong and pursue what is right.
[937.12 → 944.12] You call us to turn away from the behaviours and attitudes of the world around us,
[945.12 → 951.12] and to be renewed and transformed by your grace at work in our lives.
[951.12 → 958.12] Through your Holy Spirit, continue the work that you have begun in us,
[959.12 → 965.12] so that our words and deeds may bring honour and glory to you.
[966.12 → 969.12] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[969.12 → 975.12] These words of assurance are found in Psalm 34.
[976.12 → 984.12] The Lord is steadfast in love and hears the prayers of all who come seeking mercy.
[984.12 → 987.12] God reaches out to us in Jesus Christ,
[987.12 → 995.12] forgiving our sins and nourishing us for life without limit.
[996.12 → 1000.12] The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.
[1001.12 → 1003.12] He rescues them from all their troubles.
[1004.12 → 1007.12] The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
[1007.12 → 1011.12] He rescues those who are crushed in spirit.
[1012.12 → 1015.12] The Lord will redeem those who serve him.
[1016.12 → 1020.12] Everyone who trusts in him will be freely pardoned.
[1021.12 → 1026.12] Let's sing this Psalm 34 with the song, Taste and See.
[1026.12 → 1032.12] And our second song after this will be a song of preparation for hearing God's word.
[1032.12 → 1034.12] Speak, O Lord.
[1037.12 → 1038.12] Please do so.
[1038.12 → 1048.12] I spoke the Lord and answered me and delivered me from everything I need.
[1048.12 → 1068.34] I sought the Lord, and He answered me and delivered me from everything.
[1068.34 → 1083.78] Those who look on Him are radiant, will never be ashamed, will never be ashamed.
[1083.78 → 1099.12] This morning I, and the Lord heard me and saved me from my enemies.
[1099.12 → 1115.12] The Son of God surrounds His sins, He will deliver them, He will deliver them.
[1115.12 → 1137.96] Come, exalt His name together, glorify the Lord with me.
[1137.96 → 1145.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1145.96 → 1153.96] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1153.96 → 1160.96] Oh, blessed is He who lies in Him.
[1160.96 → 1171.96] Oh, fear the Lord, for all you sins will give you everything.
[1171.96 → 1175.96] He will give you everything.
[1175.96 → 1183.96] He will glorify the Lord with me.
[1183.96 → 1199.96] Come, exalt His name together, glorify the Lord with me.
[1199.96 → 1209.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1209.96 → 1219.96] Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[1219.96 → 1227.96] Never-ending praise, may our incense rise.
[1227.96 → 1235.96] Let us bless the Lord every day and night.
[1235.96 → 1243.96] Never-ending praise, may our incense rise.
[1243.96 → 1249.96] And defy the Lord with me.
[1249.96 → 1250.96] Come, exalt His name together, glorify the Lord with me.
[1250.96 → 1259.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1259.96 → 1261.96] Let us bless the Lord with me.
[1261.96 → 1265.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1265.96 → 1275.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1275.96 → 1278.96] Come, exalt Your name forever.
[1278.96 → 1283.96] Come, exalt His name forever.
[1283.96 → 1285.96] Amen.
[1313.96 → 1315.96] Amen.
[1343.96 → 1345.96] Amen.
[1373.96 → 1375.96] Amen.
[1403.96 → 1405.96] Amen.
[1433.96 → 1435.96] Amen.
[1463.96 → 1465.96] Amen.
[1493.96 → 1509.44] All right.
[1509.52 → 1513.14] So the children are headed to their classes with their teachers and helpers.
[1521.14 → 1522.00] So good morning.
[1522.00 → 1524.00] Good morning.
[1524.00 → 1525.00] It's good to be with you.
[1525.00 → 1526.00] For those who don't know me, my name is Jason.
[1526.00 → 1528.00] I'm the pastor here.
[1528.00 → 1533.00] And this morning we will be continuing in our study in the book of Romans.
[1533.00 → 1539.00] This is a letter in the New Testament that Paul wrote to this group of Christians in
[1539.00 → 1542.00] the city of Rome in the first century.
[1542.00 → 1549.00] And we've been working our way somewhat slowly through this letter because it is so dense.
[1549.00 → 1551.00] It is so very rich.
[1551.00 → 1554.00] It has so many wonderful things for us.
[1554.00 → 1558.00] And so this morning we are in Romans chapter 4.
[1558.00 → 1565.00] So let's open our Bibles or invite you to use your pew Bible or you may also follow along
[1565.00 → 1566.00] on the screen.
[1566.00 → 1569.00] Either way is okay.
[1569.00 → 1570.00] So Romans chapter 4.
[1570.00 → 1571.00] Romans chapter 4.
[1571.00 → 1574.00] That would be on page 838 in your pew Bible.
[1574.00 → 1576.00] Page 838.
[1576.00 → 1582.00] And we will be reading Romans 4 verses 1 through 12.
[1582.00 → 1587.00] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[1587.00 → 1593.00] What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?
[1593.00 → 1600.00] If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before
[1600.00 → 1601.00] God.
[1601.00 → 1603.00] What does the scripture say?
[1603.00 → 1609.00] Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[1609.00 → 1618.00] Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.
[1618.00 → 1624.00] However, to the man who does not work, but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is
[1624.00 → 1626.00] credited as righteousness.
[1626.00 → 1631.00] David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits
[1631.00 → 1635.00] righteousness apart from works.
[1635.00 → 1640.00] Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[1640.00 → 1647.00] Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.
[1647.00 → 1654.00] Is this blessedness only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised?
[1654.00 → 1660.00] We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.
[1660.00 → 1663.00] Under what circumstances was it credited?
[1663.00 → 1667.00] Was it after he was circumcised or before?
[1667.00 → 1671.00] It was not after, but before.
[1671.00 → 1678.00] And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while
[1678.00 → 1680.00] he was still uncircumcised.
[1680.00 → 1688.00] So then, he is the father of all who believe, but have not been circumcised, in order that
[1688.00 → 1690.00] righteousness might be credited to them.
[1690.00 → 1696.00] And he is also the father of the circumcised, who not only are circumcised, but who also
[1696.00 → 1703.00] walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
[1703.00 → 1705.00] This is the word of the Lord.
[1705.00 → 1706.00] Thank you, God.
[1706.00 → 1712.00] Would you please join me in prayer as we ask for God's blessing upon his word this morning.
[1712.00 → 1718.00] Our father, we thank you for this day, this cloudy day that you have made.
[1718.00 → 1726.00] And we ask, oh Lord, that you would help us to put aside anything that may cause us to stumble
[1726.00 → 1731.00] at your word, whether in our bodies or in our souls.
[1731.00 → 1740.00] Give us, Lord, with the grace that you make available to us, the strength to listen, and to be changed
[1740.00 → 1741.00] by your word.
[1741.00 → 1743.00] Because we are hearing the very words of God.
[1743.00 → 1751.00] We are hearing of a salvation that is available to all freely, to all who believe.
[1751.00 → 1756.00] And we pray, Lord, in your name, and for your glory.
[1756.00 → 1759.00] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1759.00 → 1766.00] Now, most of us spend our lives trying to justify ourselves.
[1766.00 → 1767.00] Isn't that true?
[1767.00 → 1769.00] And I don't mean that in a negative sense.
[1769.00 → 1771.00] That's just the way life is.
[1771.00 → 1775.00] We go about trying to prove ourselves.
[1775.00 → 1777.00] So here's an example.
[1777.00 → 1783.00] Last Friday was Valentine's Day, and my wife, Christy, she shared something that they did at Richmond
[1783.00 → 1789.00] Christian School, which is that the students were able to buy candy grams.
[1789.00 → 1793.00] Like telegrams, candy grams.
[1793.00 → 1795.00] And then send them to each other.
[1795.00 → 1796.00] Right?
[1796.00 → 1801.00] So you can send a candy gram to a friend or to maybe someone you like.
[1801.00 → 1806.00] And she said one of her students was talking about this in her class and said,
[1806.00 → 1808.00] Now, how much do they cost?
[1808.00 → 1810.00] Two dollars, right?
[1810.00 → 1813.00] If you like a girl, you don't give her one candy gram.
[1813.00 → 1815.00] You give her 15.
[1815.00 → 1818.00] He's not wrong.
[1818.00 → 1820.00] This is a good strategy.
[1820.00 → 1823.00] You've got to prove yourself.
[1823.00 → 1827.00] That's how you show a girl you like her.
[1827.00 → 1828.00] Right?
[1828.00 → 1830.00] 15 candy grams.
[1830.00 → 1835.00] Students want to prove themselves, right?
[1835.00 → 1843.00] To their teachers, to their parents, maybe to their classmates, by working hard to get good grades.
[1843.00 → 1844.00] Right?
[1844.00 → 1852.00] They don't go and say, well, to the one who does not work but trusts the teacher to justify the lazy student, they will be given good grades.
[1852.00 → 1853.00] Okay?
[1853.00 → 1855.00] That's not how it works.
[1855.00 → 1861.00] People at work are trying to do whatever they can to prove themselves.
[1861.00 → 1865.00] You know, and most of us have some experience with a resume.
[1865.00 → 1870.00] What is a resume but self-justification?
[1870.00 → 1872.00] It is to say, this is what I can do.
[1872.00 → 1874.00] This is who I am.
[1874.00 → 1875.00] Right?
[1875.00 → 1877.00] This is why you should hire me.
[1877.00 → 1880.00] I am able to offer these things.
[1880.00 → 1882.00] This is how we live most of our lives.
[1882.00 → 1886.00] Proving ourselves in all kinds of different ways.
[1886.00 → 1891.00] So when it comes to speaking to people on a Sunday morning about the exact same thing,
[1891.00 → 1900.00] the exact opposite principle that God justifies the ungodly, not based on anything we do to prove ourselves,
[1900.00 → 1903.00] while we have a hard time believing it.
[1903.00 → 1906.00] Because it is so contrary to the way we live.
[1906.00 → 1914.00] It tends to be a little difficult for us to really receive that truth deeply into our hearts.
[1914.00 → 1921.00] But this is the astonishing claim that Paul is making so far in Romans.
[1921.00 → 1927.00] That we are justified before God, not because of anything that we do.
[1927.00 → 1933.00] Not because of anything we do to prove ourselves, but as a gift.
[1933.00 → 1936.00] And it's the gift of God's righteousness that is given to us.
[1936.00 → 1939.00] In the way, how do we receive this righteousness?
[1939.00 → 1941.00] It is through faith.
[1941.00 → 1951.00] Which does not mean that faith is somehow this one remaining act of righteousness that we do to prove ourselves to God.
[1951.00 → 1954.00] Where we say, God, look at my faith.
[1954.00 → 1957.00] Surely my faith must prove myself.
[1957.00 → 1962.00] No, the faith, the idea is that faith is the opposite of works.
[1962.00 → 1971.00] Faith is simply just the empty hands that we have to receive the righteousness that God gives us,
[1971.00 → 1973.00] so that it is by grace alone.
[1973.00 → 1978.00] So this is what Paul has been saying, especially in our last passage.
[1978.00 → 1985.00] Now, in chapter 4, Paul goes on to strengthen his argument.
[1985.00 → 1991.00] And he does that by citing two historical cases or examples.
[1991.00 → 1995.00] He talks about Abraham, and he talks about David, King David.
[1995.00 → 2002.00] And he argues that this doctrine of justification by faith is not a new thing that he's just coming up with.
[2002.00 → 2009.00] Because, he says, Abraham was justified by faith and David was also justified by faith.
[2009.00 → 2012.00] So, now, why these two?
[2012.00 → 2014.00] Why does he choose Abraham?
[2014.00 → 2015.00] Why does he choose David?
[2015.00 → 2018.00] Well, let's think about Abraham.
[2018.00 → 2024.00] In the Old Testament, nobody had a higher status than Abraham.
[2024.00 → 2028.00] He was the father of the nation of Israel.
[2028.00 → 2030.00] Right? He is where it all started.
[2030.00 → 2033.00] The people of God started with Abram.
[2033.00 → 2038.00] And then David, well, David was Israel's greatest king.
[2038.00 → 2042.00] Right? He is the model, the hope for all future kings.
[2042.00 → 2044.00] He was this warrior poet.
[2044.00 → 2050.00] And so, for the Jews, this appeal to Abraham and to David,
[2050.00 → 2055.00] it's an appeal to their first ancestor, to their model ruler.
[2055.00 → 2059.00] And so, Paul, here, he's wondering out loud.
[2059.00 → 2065.00] He's anticipating the questions that his readers and the listeners of his letter will have.
[2065.00 → 2072.00] And saying, well, look, these guys, were they justified by faith in the same way as we are?
[2072.00 → 2073.00] Right?
[2073.00 → 2078.00] Is God consistent in the way that he works with his people?
[2078.00 → 2081.00] Bringing them into relationship with him?
[2081.00 → 2086.00] Are they going to back David up in what he's saying?
[2086.00 → 2088.00] Or are they going to disagree with him?
[2088.00 → 2090.00] Well, let's see what happens.
[2090.00 → 2094.00] Okay, let's see what Paul says here in Romans 4.
[2094.00 → 2096.00] And we're going to start with the example of Abraham.
[2096.00 → 2101.00] Okay, so let's look at what Paul says as he begins his argument in verses 1 and 2.
[2101.00 → 2102.00] He says,
[2102.00 → 2108.00] What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter?
[2109.00 → 2117.00] If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God.
[2117.00 → 2127.00] And so, Paul is arguing, if Abraham was justified, proven by the things he did, he could very well say,
[2127.00 → 2128.00] Look at me.
[2128.00 → 2131.00] Look at all that I've done.
[2131.00 → 2133.00] Look at that I am a righteous man.
[2133.00 → 2135.00] I am justified by what I have done.
[2136.00 → 2137.00] But did he?
[2137.00 → 2138.00] Right?
[2138.00 → 2142.00] Did Abraham have works he could point to, to prove himself to God?
[2142.00 → 2146.00] And Paul is insisting that Abraham could not boast before God.
[2146.00 → 2157.00] And in verse 3, he goes on, and he quotes from Genesis chapter 15 verse 6, which BEV read for us earlier.
[2157.00 → 2159.00] To make his argument, he says,
[2159.00 → 2161.00] Well, what does Scripture say?
[2161.00 → 2164.00] Always a good question to ask, right?
[2164.00 → 2165.00] What does Scripture say?
[2165.00 → 2172.00] He said, Abraham, then quote, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[2172.00 → 2175.00] And we'll talk about what that means in a bit.
[2175.00 → 2184.00] But first, I want to give us a sense of where this comes in, in Abraham's story.
[2184.00 → 2186.00] Because this is kind of important to Paul's argument.
[2186.00 → 2187.00] Okay?
[2187.00 → 2190.00] Now, some of you know this story very well.
[2190.00 → 2193.00] For some of you, this might be very new to you.
[2193.00 → 2199.00] If you were a Jew in Paul's time, you would have been extremely familiar with this story.
[2199.00 → 2201.00] So, here it is.
[2201.00 → 2206.00] The story of Abraham begins in Genesis chapter 12.
[2206.00 → 2208.00] So, Abraham, who is this guy?
[2208.00 → 2209.00] Who is Abram?
[2209.00 → 2212.00] Well, he's, he's a guy living in the great city of Your.
[2212.00 → 2217.00] This ancient Mesopotamian city in modern day Iraq.
[2217.00 → 2225.00] And God comes to Abraham and says, leave your land, leave your family, leave your people.
[2225.00 → 2228.00] I am going to bring you into a new land, the land of Canaan.
[2228.00 → 2231.00] And God promises to bless Abraham.
[2231.00 → 2237.00] And, and to, to bless all the families of the earth through him.
[2237.00 → 2240.00] That's an this, this amazing promise.
[2240.00 → 2252.00] And Abram says, okay, this, this God who I didn't know before, not the God of my fathers, but you have come to me, you have said this thing, and I'm in.
[2252.00 → 2253.00] Okay?
[2253.00 → 2258.00] And so he listens to God, he goes, and the story starts out pretty well.
[2258.00 → 2268.00] But at the end of Genesis 12, Abram and his wife, Sarai, they have to emigrate from Canaan to Egypt because of a famine.
[2268.00 → 2271.00] And Egypt is the bread basket of the ancient Near East.
[2271.00 → 2272.00] So they go to Egypt.
[2272.00 → 2275.00] While in Egypt, there's this sort of infamous story that happens.
[2275.00 → 2281.00] Abraham gets scared that he's going to get killed because he has a very pretty wife.
[2281.00 → 2286.00] Now, this is something that I have to deal with regularly.
[2286.00 → 2288.00] So what does he do?
[2288.00 → 2289.00] I don't do this.
[2289.00 → 2293.00] He pretends that she is his sister instead.
[2293.00 → 2295.00] This is a very ugly situation.
[2295.00 → 2300.00] So Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, takes Sarai into his palace.
[2300.00 → 2302.00] It's not good.
[2302.00 → 2305.00] But he treats Abraham well because of her.
[2305.00 → 2309.00] And he gives Abram lots of sheep and goats and camels.
[2309.00 → 2312.00] So Abraham becomes quite wealthy at this point.
[2312.00 → 2315.00] In Genesis 13, they go back to Canaan.
[2315.00 → 2324.00] Fast forwarding ahead, in Genesis 15, after a bunch of stuff happens, God comes to talk with Abram again.
[2324.00 → 2328.00] And Abram is frustrated with God.
[2328.00 → 2330.00] All this time has gone by.
[2330.00 → 2332.00] Where are God's promises?
[2332.00 → 2336.00] So he says, God, you promised to bless me.
[2336.00 → 2338.00] But I don't have an heir.
[2338.00 → 2347.00] And all of these possessions that I have gotten, everything I've gained, is all going to this guy, Eleazar of Damascus, who was Abram's chief servant.
[2347.00 → 2350.00] And God says, no, that is not going to happen.
[2350.00 → 2352.00] You are going to have an heir.
[2352.00 → 2364.00] And God takes Abram, this beautiful scene, this very vivid scene that's happening, takes Abram outside his tent and says, look up at the stars in the sky.
[2364.00 → 2368.00] You know if you were I to do that here, we might say, okay, one, two, three.
[2368.00 → 2370.00] That's, you know, that's all the stars we can see.
[2370.00 → 2379.00] But before light pollution, you can imagine a sky that's just scattered with thousands and thousands of brilliant diamonds of stars in the sky.
[2379.00 → 2381.00] You could probably see the Milky Way.
[2381.00 → 2386.00] And so God says, look up at the stars and try to count them.
[2386.00 → 2390.00] That is how many offspring you are going to have.
[2390.00 → 2393.00] An uncountable number.
[2393.00 → 2397.00] And at this point in the story, here's Abram.
[2397.00 → 2400.00] He's staring up into the sky.
[2400.00 → 2401.00] He has no heir.
[2401.00 → 2406.00] He has a wife who is now quite advanced in years and not able to conceive.
[2406.00 → 2409.00] He has a spotty moral record.
[2409.00 → 2412.00] He's living in a foreign land in a tent.
[2412.00 → 2418.00] And at that moment, Abram believes God.
[2418.00 → 2420.00] He believes.
[2420.00 → 2425.00] There's nothing that he could trust in himself.
[2425.00 → 2427.00] That's the point.
[2427.00 → 2431.00] There's nothing that he could do to make this promise come true.
[2431.00 → 2433.00] He can't trust himself.
[2433.00 → 2437.00] He can't accomplish what God asked him or said would happen.
[2437.00 → 2442.00] His only option was to trust the God who could do these kinds of things.
[2442.00 → 2448.00] The God who can give countless offspring in the promise of this land.
[2448.00 → 2451.00] And so Abram did.
[2451.00 → 2455.00] Abram believed that God would do all of these things for him.
[2455.00 → 2460.00] And God then credits righteousness to Abram.
[2460.00 → 2463.00] Simply because he believed in God.
[2463.00 → 2468.00] So Abram didn't prove himself in any way to God.
[2468.00 → 2470.00] He didn't have to do anything.
[2470.00 → 2475.00] He simply says, okay, God, I will trust in you.
[2475.00 → 2477.00] You will do it.
[2477.00 → 2482.00] And then Paul now in Romans 4 is saying, this is the way the gospel works.
[2482.00 → 2491.00] This is how we are saved by God crediting righteousness to us that is not ours.
[2491.00 → 2492.00] It's not inherently ours.
[2492.00 → 2495.00] It doesn't belong to us, but it comes from God.
[2495.00 → 2500.00] It's this alien righteousness, this foreign righteousness.
[2500.00 → 2503.00] Now, if we look at verse 4, Paul says this.
[2503.00 → 2510.00] Now, to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation.
[2510.00 → 2513.00] So he's saying, well, let's think about the opposite.
[2513.00 → 2520.00] The opposite of free grace is you do something, and you get paid for it.
[2520.00 → 2528.00] So he says, imagine that all of us simply receive what is due to us in the same way that you receive wages from a job.
[2528.00 → 2529.00] So many of us have had jobs.
[2529.00 → 2534.00] When I was in high school, I worked at a little store in the town where I lived.
[2534.00 → 2539.00] And this store sold outdoor clothing, bikes, and skis.
[2539.00 → 2541.00] It was a cool place to work.
[2541.00 → 2543.00] And my job was to, you know, I was in high school.
[2543.00 → 2545.00] So I mowed the lawn in front of the store.
[2545.00 → 2547.00] I washed the store windows.
[2547.00 → 2550.00] I swept the sidewalks.
[2550.00 → 2553.00] And then I, you know, rented out bikes to the tourists.
[2553.00 → 2557.00] And I sold shoes to people and all these kinds of things.
[2557.00 → 2559.00] It was work, right?
[2559.00 → 2564.00] I mean, I enjoyed it fine, but I wasn't doing it for fun, right?
[2564.00 → 2565.00] This wasn't volunteer.
[2565.00 → 2567.00] So why did I do this?
[2567.00 → 2571.00] Well, it's because once a week I got that paycheck in my hand, right?
[2571.00 → 2573.00] The best moment of the week.
[2573.00 → 2576.00] And I would spend it on this and on that.
[2576.00 → 2578.00] And I saved a little as well.
[2578.00 → 2583.00] And I had worked hard all week, and I was going to get what I earned.
[2583.00 → 2594.00] My paycheck was credited to me, not as a gift, not out of the kindness of my employer's heart, but as my due.
[2594.00 → 2598.00] And of course, that is the same for everyone here who works.
[2598.00 → 2599.00] Right?
[2599.00 → 2603.00] We work in order to get something that is our due, not as a gift.
[2603.00 → 2606.00] But the gospel says something a little different.
[2606.00 → 2608.00] Look at verse five.
[2608.00 → 2619.00] However, to the one who does not work but trust God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.
[2619.00 → 2621.00] And that is the way the gospel works.
[2621.00 → 2625.00] It's the opposite of the way everything else in life works.
[2625.00 → 2626.00] Right?
[2626.00 → 2630.00] So salvation is not given to us as our due, as wages.
[2630.00 → 2632.00] Salvation is given as a gift.
[2632.00 → 2635.00] We could say out of the kindness of God's heart.
[2635.00 → 2639.00] Out of His love, out of His mercy and His grace.
[2639.00 → 2646.00] And so you see how this cuts against the grain of how we live in every other area of life.
[2646.00 → 2649.00] And that is why it's so hard for us to accept this.
[2649.00 → 2650.00] Right?
[2650.00 → 2660.00] To someone who simply believes God, no matter what they have done, good or bad, He is counted as righteous.
[2660.00 → 2661.00] Yes.
[2661.00 → 2662.00] Yes.
[2662.00 → 2663.00] Yes.
[2663.00 → 2665.00] That is the gospel.
[2665.00 → 2669.00] So now Paul moves on to David.
[2669.00 → 2672.00] Abraham was justified by faith.
[2672.00 → 2673.00] Well, okay.
[2673.00 → 2675.00] Well, how about David?
[2675.00 → 2686.00] Well, now besides David being the greatest king that Israel has ever had, there's another important reason why Paul would look to David as an example.
[2686.00 → 2687.00] It's because of this.
[2687.00 → 2694.00] Now, a clever person might ask or argue, well, look, Abraham, he didn't have the law.
[2694.00 → 2697.00] The law came hundreds of years after Abraham.
[2697.00 → 2711.00] So, did David having the law, having the rituals, the sacrifices, the temple, all the stuff, was he also justified by faith in the same way that Abraham was?
[2711.00 → 2713.00] So, let's look at David.
[2713.00 → 2715.00] What did David believe?
[2715.00 → 2717.00] This is what Paul says in verse 6.
[2717.00 → 2720.00] David says the same thing.
[2720.00 → 2727.00] When he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works.
[2727.00 → 2734.00] Then, so he's saying that David talked about the same thing.
[2734.00 → 2736.00] David wrote about the same thing.
[2736.00 → 2741.00] He also knew that righteousness comes not by works.
[2741.00 → 2745.00] And again, Paul quotes scripture.
[2745.00 → 2750.00] So, in verses 7 and 8, Paul quotes from Psalm 32.
[2750.00 → 2754.00] Where David, the psalmist, he writes,
[2754.00 → 2760.00] Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[2760.00 → 2766.00] Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.
[2766.00 → 2776.00] So, I need to point out something important textually, which is that same word is used here.
[2776.00 → 2785.00] That word that Paul has used already several times in our passage in verse 3, in verse 4, in verse 5, in verse 6, four times.
[2785.00 → 2787.00] The word is logizomai.
[2787.00 → 2790.00] It's that word to count or to credit.
[2790.00 → 2793.00] He's been saying credit, credit, credit, count.
[2793.00 → 2794.00] It's the same.
[2794.00 → 2796.00] I don't know why the translators didn't use the word credit.
[2796.00 → 2798.00] It's the same word in the original.
[2798.00 → 2802.00] But, and it's this word to credit or to count.
[2802.00 → 2804.00] And it's a counting term.
[2804.00 → 2806.00] So, all of you accountants, rejoice.
[2806.00 → 2809.00] Mel, you can understand this.
[2809.00 → 2812.00] To count or credit.
[2812.00 → 2819.00] And Paul has been saying that through faith, God credits or counts righteousness to the believer.
[2819.00 → 2824.00] He puts it on the positive side of the ledger.
[2824.00 → 2829.00] And then now in talking about David, Paul says kind of the opposite.
[2829.00 → 2832.00] He's saying something that God is not counting.
[2832.00 → 2835.00] He is not counting sins against us.
[2835.00 → 2841.00] He's not putting our sins on the liability side of the ledger as a debt.
[2841.00 → 2849.00] So, God counts righteousness to us, but he does not count our sins against us.
[2849.00 → 2851.00] And this is the doctrine of justification.
[2851.00 → 2853.00] It has those two sides to it.
[2853.00 → 2857.00] Now, think about David.
[2857.00 → 2858.00] Think about who David is.
[2858.00 → 2861.00] David, he had plenty of reasons to boast.
[2861.00 → 2866.00] He had plenty of ways that he might try to prove himself to God.
[2866.00 → 2868.00] Right? David was brave.
[2868.00 → 2869.00] He was courageous.
[2869.00 → 2871.00] He was worshipful.
[2871.00 → 2873.00] He was this warrior poet.
[2873.00 → 2876.00] But he was also a sinner.
[2876.00 → 2878.00] He was cowardly.
[2878.00 → 2880.00] He was lustful.
[2880.00 → 2881.00] He was violent.
[2881.00 → 2885.00] He danced before the Lord with all of his might.
[2885.00 → 2888.00] And yet he was an adulterer and a murderer.
[2888.00 → 2890.00] He had lots of reasons to boast.
[2890.00 → 2895.00] And he had lots of reasons to be crushed by his own sinfulness.
[2895.00 → 2900.00] And David says, here's what I boast in.
[2900.00 → 2907.00] The blessed person, the truly happy person, is one whose sin is not counted against them.
[2907.00 → 2915.00] Now, the next thing Paul does is he's going on, he's going to answer another question.
[2915.00 → 2919.00] Another question that people might have as they read his argument.
[2919.00 → 2920.00] And the question is this.
[2920.00 → 2928.00] Okay, well, if Abraham and David are both of these Jewish forefathers who receive the righteousness of God by faith,
[2928.00 → 2930.00] then maybe it's only for the Jews.
[2930.00 → 2931.00] Right?
[2931.00 → 2935.00] You know, these are Jewish forbearers.
[2935.00 → 2938.00] Maybe the way this all works, this is just a Jewish thing.
[2938.00 → 2941.00] Maybe it's a blessing for those who are circumcised.
[2941.00 → 2945.00] Well, in verse 10, Paul gives his response.
[2945.00 → 2948.00] And he does so by asking a question.
[2948.00 → 2949.00] Here's the question he asks.
[2949.00 → 2953.00] When was Abraham's faith counted as righteousness?
[2953.00 → 2955.00] When did that happen?
[2955.00 → 2959.00] Was it before he was circumcised?
[2959.00 → 2961.00] Or was it after he was circumcised?
[2961.00 → 2973.00] And of course, brilliantly, if you read Genesis, you find that Abraham's faith was counted to him as righteousness before he was circumcised.
[2973.00 → 2984.00] In fact, Abraham believed and was justified, as we read in Genesis 15, 14 years before he was circumcised.
[2985.00 → 2987.00] That is quite remarkable.
[2987.00 → 2994.00] He wasn't circumcised, and he definitely didn't have the law, and yet he was justified.
[2994.00 → 2998.00] He was justified before God by faith.
[2998.00 → 3000.00] That's how.
[3000.00 → 3001.00] And so what's Paul saying?
[3001.00 → 3003.00] He's saying, guess what?
[3003.00 → 3006.00] Abraham was a Gentile.
[3006.00 → 3011.00] That's shocking to the Jews.
[3011.00 → 3018.00] Abraham was a Gentile who was justified by faith in God.
[3018.00 → 3026.00] And he received the sign of circumcision as a sign and a seal of God's righteousness that he had received.
[3026.00 → 3033.00] And therefore, Abraham is the father of both the circumcised Jews and the uncircumcised Gentiles.
[3033.00 → 3041.00] Because it was faith that brings him and all of us who believe into a covenant relationship with God.
[3041.00 → 3046.00] Now, there's a lot more we can say about these verses.
[3046.00 → 3051.00] In particular, this is a great passage to prove infant baptism.
[3051.00 → 3054.00] We're not going to go into that right now because it'll take a long time.
[3054.00 → 3059.00] But I want to conclude by looking at a couple of points of application.
[3059.00 → 3064.00] What does the doctrine of justification mean for us?
[3064.00 → 3066.00] What does this mean for us?
[3066.00 → 3071.00] Now, for all of us who have been believers for a long time, I want us to think about this.
[3071.00 → 3078.00] Think about all the things that you have done since you have become a Christian.
[3078.00 → 3082.00] Think about all the prayers.
[3082.00 → 3089.00] How many prayers have you said since you've become a Christian?
[3089.00 → 3093.00] Think about how many times you've been to church.
[3093.00 → 3098.00] Maybe for some of us, from our mother's womb, we have come to church.
[3098.00 → 3102.00] All the money you have put into those offering bags.
[3102.00 → 3105.00] We don't really know what the deacons do with that.
[3105.00 → 3112.00] All the ways that you've tried to obey God's commandments and followed the way of Christ.
[3112.00 → 3117.00] All the times that you wanted to speak but didn't.
[3117.00 → 3119.00] All the Bible studies.
[3119.00 → 3121.00] All the times you made a meal for someone.
[3121.00 → 3125.00] All the times you've taught Sunday school and served as an office bearer.
[3125.00 → 3138.00] Think about all of that and now realize that you are no more justified before God now than you were when you first believed.
[3138.00 → 3140.00] In this way, it's kind of like marriage.
[3140.00 → 3143.00] Think of all the things you've done in your marriage.
[3143.00 → 3145.00] The outings together.
[3145.00 → 3147.00] The meals shared.
[3147.00 → 3150.00] The conflicts worked through.
[3150.00 → 3157.00] But after all of that, in reality, you're actually just still married.
[3157.00 → 3162.00] Now, you may have a happier marriage or a less happy marriage because of those things.
[3162.00 → 3169.00] But when you first got married and then after many, many, many years of life together, you're still just married.
[3169.00 → 3172.00] And it's the same with justification.
[3172.00 → 3173.00] Right?
[3173.00 → 3179.00] As soon as you believe in what God has done to save you through Jesus Christ, you are justified.
[3179.00 → 3181.00] You belong to God.
[3181.00 → 3183.00] You are in a covenant relationship with God.
[3183.00 → 3194.00] And nothing you actually do from the time you believe in the time that God takes you out of this world is actually going to make you more justified than you are now.
[3194.00 → 3197.00] So that's good news.
[3197.00 → 3199.00] That's who you are.
[3199.00 → 3201.00] You are justified through faith.
[3201.00 → 3205.00] It's a gift of God's love and His righteousness.
[3205.00 → 3208.00] Now, here's the second point I want to make.
[3208.00 → 3212.00] Think about how do we deal with our sin?
[3212.00 → 3215.00] As Christians, how do we deal with our sin?
[3215.00 → 3222.00] There are three common responses to our sin.
[3222.00 → 3224.00] The first response is this.
[3224.00 → 3225.00] We just ignore it.
[3225.00 → 3226.00] Right?
[3226.00 → 3228.00] We want to pretend it didn't happen.
[3228.00 → 3229.00] Maybe no one noticed.
[3229.00 → 3231.00] Maybe it wasn't that big of a deal.
[3231.00 → 3233.00] Let's just move on.
[3233.00 → 3234.00] That was then.
[3234.00 → 3235.00] This is now.
[3235.00 → 3236.00] Today's a new day.
[3236.00 → 3237.00] We ignore our sin.
[3239.00 → 3241.00] Some of us excuse our sin.
[3241.00 → 3244.00] We want to give reasons why it happened.
[3244.00 → 3245.00] Right?
[3245.00 → 3246.00] You know, this is why I did it.
[3246.00 → 3247.00] I have a good reason.
[3247.00 → 3250.00] Or here's why I was forced into that position.
[3250.00 → 3253.00] I didn't really have much of a choice.
[3253.00 → 3255.00] And did it harm anyone really?
[3255.00 → 3259.00] And maybe actually you are overreacting.
[3259.00 → 3262.00] We have so many excuses for our sin.
[3262.00 → 3266.00] Then, you know, another way that we respond to our sin is we just despair.
[3266.00 → 3267.00] We despair.
[3267.00 → 3269.00] We don't ignore our sin.
[3269.00 → 3271.00] We don't excuse our sin.
[3271.00 → 3273.00] We know we did it.
[3273.00 → 3276.00] And we spiral into guilt and shame.
[3276.00 → 3279.00] We feel badly because of what we've done.
[3279.00 → 3283.00] Or we believe that there is something deeply wrong with us because of what we have done.
[3283.00 → 3284.00] That's shame.
[3285.00 → 3288.00] But David offers us another way to deal with sin.
[3289.00 → 3290.00] Right?
[3290.00 → 3291.00] You don't ignore your sin.
[3291.00 → 3292.00] It happened.
[3292.00 → 3293.00] It was bad.
[3294.00 → 3295.00] You don't excuse your sin.
[3295.00 → 3296.00] You did it.
[3296.00 → 3298.00] It wasn't anybody's fault but yours.
[3298.00 → 3301.00] But you don't have to despair by your sin.
[3301.00 → 3304.00] You know, it's not the only thing that is true about you.
[3304.00 → 3305.00] Right?
[3305.00 → 3307.00] Your sin doesn't define you.
[3307.00 → 3314.00] The gospel response to sin is that if you trust in Jesus, God does not count your sin against you.
[3314.00 → 3315.00] Right?
[3315.00 → 3317.00] Your sin is covered.
[3317.00 → 3324.00] So do you believe God loves you more if you are good?
[3324.00 → 3328.00] Do you believe that God loves you more when you are not sinning?
[3329.00 → 3331.00] No, he does not.
[3331.00 → 3332.00] Okay?
[3332.00 → 3336.00] A Christian who sins is still beloved by God.
[3336.00 → 3339.00] You are still justified by God.
[3339.00 → 3340.00] Why?
[3340.00 → 3344.00] Because what can take Christ's righteousness away from you?
[3344.00 → 3345.00] Nothing.
[3345.00 → 3346.00] Nothing.
[3346.00 → 3347.00] Nothing.
[3347.00 → 3348.00] It didn't come from you.
[3348.00 → 3351.00] So it doesn't depend on you.
[3351.00 → 3353.00] You received it.
[3353.00 → 3354.00] You can't lose it.
[3354.00 → 3356.00] You can't break it.
[3356.00 → 3357.00] You can't crash it.
[3357.00 → 3358.00] You can't light it on fire.
[3358.00 → 3360.00] You can't do anything to it.
[3360.00 → 3365.00] And so it doesn't matter how many bad things you've done or how many good things you've done
[3365.00 → 3368.00] because you don't need to prove yourself for God to accept you.
[3369.00 → 3374.00] The grounds of your acceptance is simply believing in God.
[3374.00 → 3375.00] You can't do it.
[3375.00 → 3376.00] You can't do it.
[3376.00 → 3377.00] Like Abraham.
[3377.00 → 3382.00] You have no ability to accomplish your salvation, any of God's promises.
[3383.00 → 3384.00] But God can.
[3384.00 → 3386.00] So you put your faith in him.
[3386.00 → 3396.00] You simply believe God who credits righteousness to your account and who covers all of your sins.
[3396.00 → 3399.00] It's not an easy doctrine to believe.
[3399.00 → 3400.00] Right?
[3400.00 → 3407.00] Because when you believe you have been justified by faith alone, that God now declares you righteous in his sight,
[3408.00 → 3411.00] it means you do not need to prove yourself any longer.
[3411.00 → 3416.00] And in fact, all you need to do is the opposite of what you do every day of your life.
[3416.00 → 3425.00] What you do all day long, you just believe that the most valuable thing that you can ever have in this life, in this world,
[3425.00 → 3427.00] is something that you cannot buy.
[3427.00 → 3430.00] But that is freely given.
[3430.00 → 3431.00] So let's pray.
[3431.00 → 3441.00] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[3441.00 → 3446.00] And we pray, Lord, for the grace to believe.
[3446.00 → 3449.00] It's not even something that we have in ourselves.
[3450.00 → 3457.00] We need your grace to put our trust in you, to believe that you justify the ungodly.
[3458.00 → 3464.00] So, Lord, would you help us to place all of our sins upon Christ for forgiveness,
[3464.00 → 3468.00] and let us receive the robe of righteousness that comes by faith.
[3469.00 → 3472.00] And all to the praise of Christ's glorious name.
[3473.00 → 3474.00] Amen.
[3494.00 → 3495.00] Heavenly Father, thank you for your hate, of humane to our lives.
[3495.00 → 3501.00] Your grace is filled to anything less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[3505.00 → 3509.06] More and have not just LIKE this WF u Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du PUR your Du
[3509.06 → 3514.86] In less than Jesus' blood and righteous loss,
[3514.86 → 3519.70] I dare not trust the spirit's claim,
[3520.12 → 3525.26] Our holy name, on Jesus' name.
[3525.82 → 3530.30] On Christ the solid, on my stand,
[3530.68 → 3535.08] All other ground is sinking sand,
[3535.08 → 3540.88] All other ground is sinking sand.
[3541.98 → 3546.52] When darkness fills His lovely face,
[3546.88 → 3551.32] My rest of His unchanging grace,
[3551.66 → 3556.02] In every high and stormy near,
[3556.42 → 3561.30] My anchor holds within the veil.
[3561.30 → 3566.50] On Christ the solid, on my stand,
[3566.82 → 3571.30] All other ground is sinking sand,
[3571.30 → 3576.98] All other ground is sinking sand.
[3578.10 → 3582.54] He's told His covenant, His blood,
[3582.92 → 3587.34] Support me in the world with blood,
[3587.34 → 3592.20] Tread all around, my soul gives pain,
[3592.46 → 3597.34] In any song, my hope and stay.
[3598.14 → 3602.64] On Christ the solid, on my stand,
[3603.02 → 3607.54] All other ground is sinking sand,
[3607.74 → 3612.78] All other ground is sinking sand.

[3625.14 → 3628.10] Rest in His fallen chest,
[3628.18 → 3629.32] Rest instant of love,

[3630.96 → 3634.00] Stand before the throne.
[3634.70 → 3637.02] For merciless,
[3637.02 → 3652.62] All other ground is sinking sand
[3667.02 → 3676.32] We are privileged to give back to God from the bounty he has bestowed on us.
[3676.32 → 3683.32] Today our offering is for the work of Howard and Danni Johnson, their son Tim, and Tim's wife Charity,
[3683.32 → 3690.76] the Johnson's minister to three reserves in the Secwepemek territory near Chase, B.C.
[3690.76 → 3694.66] Their most recent newsletter can be found on the foyer table.
[3694.66 → 3697.66] If the deacons could please come forward.
[3724.66 → 3727.66] . . . .
[3727.66 → 3729.66] . . . .
[3729.66 → 3759.64] Thank you.
[3759.66 → 3789.64] Thank you.
[3789.66 → 3819.64] Thank you.
[3819.66 → 3821.66] Thank you.
[3823.10 → 3838.66] Before we have our community prayer, I just want to thank our musicians today and our vocalists, Owen, Marion, Henry, and having Angell here was just a real treat. Thank you so much. Just lovely music. Much appreciated.
[3838.66 → 3855.30] Because we who believe are credited with righteousness, let us bring the needs of the church, the world, and all in need to God's loving care.
[3855.30 → 3862.84] Please respond with the words, Lord, in your mercy, by saying, hear our prayer.
[3862.84 → 3892.82] Let us pray.
[3892.84 → 3922.84] 
[3922.84 → 3924.84] Let us pray.
[3924.84 → 3954.84] 
[3954.84 → 3984.84] 
[3984.84 → 3986.84] Let us pray.
[3986.84 → 3988.84] Let us pray.
[3988.84 → 4000.02] Hear the cries of the world's hungry and suffering. May each person have their rightful share of food, medical care, and shelter, and so have the necessities of a life of dignity.
[4000.02 → 4010.16] Bless those ministries that are your hands and feet to those in need. Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4010.16 → 4026.48] Lord, strengthen this congregation, strengthen this congregation, fill our hearts with your self-giving love, that our voices may speak your praise, and our lives may conform to the image of your Son.
[4026.48 → 4027.48] Lord, in your mercy, hear our hearts with your son.
[4027.48 → 4028.48] Lord, in your mercy, hear our hearts with your heart.
[4028.48 → 4042.48] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4042.48 → 4046.48] Look with compassion on all who suffer.
[4046.48 → 4061.48] Support with your love those with incurable diseases, those unjustly imprisoned, those denied dignity, those who live without hope, those who are unhoused or abandoned.
[4061.48 → 4073.48] As you have moved toward us in love, so lead us to be present with them in their suffering in the name of Jesus Christ.
[4073.48 → 4077.48] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4077.48 → 4079.52] Sister 3
[4079.52 → 4084.48] Sustain those among us who need your healing touch.
[4084.48 → 4086.48] Make the sick whole.
