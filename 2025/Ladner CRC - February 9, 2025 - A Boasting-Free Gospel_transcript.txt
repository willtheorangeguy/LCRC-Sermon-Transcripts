[2099.80 --> 2129.78]  Thank you.
[2129.80 --> 2159.78]  Thank you.
[2159.78 --> 2189.76]  Thank you.
[2189.78 --> 2219.76]  Thank you.
[2219.78 --> 2220.78]  Amen.
[2249.78 --> 2279.76]  So, you're doing this.
[2279.76 --> 2309.74]  I'll pass it.
[2309.74 --> 2339.72]  So, you're doing this.
[2339.72 --> 2369.70]  You can take it.
[2369.70 --> 2399.68]  You're doing this.
[2399.70 --> 2429.66]  So, you're doing this.
[2429.66 --> 2459.64]  You're doing this.
[2459.64 --> 2489.62]  All right, you're doing this.
[2489.62 --> 2519.60]  And go to your classes.
[2519.60 --> 2549.58]  So, you're doing this.
[2549.58 --> 2579.56]  If you're doing this.
[2579.56 --> 2609.54]  And so, you're doing this.
[2609.54 --> 2639.52]  Okay, that's on page, you're doing this.
[2639.52 --> 2669.50]  But, you're doing this.
[2669.50 --> 2699.48]  This is the word of the law.
[2699.48 --> 2729.46]  And so, you're doing this.
[2729.46 --> 2759.44]  And so, you're doing this.
[2759.44 --> 2789.42]  I'm doing this.
[2789.42 --> 2819.40]  And so, you're doing this.
[2819.40 --> 2849.38]  You have the bread.
[2849.38 --> 2879.36]  And so, you're doing this.
[2879.36 --> 2909.34]  It's no longer good news.
[2909.34 --> 2939.32]  Yeah, there, okay.
[2939.32 --> 2969.30]  And so, you're doing this.
[2969.30 --> 2999.28]  And so, you're doing this.
[2999.28 --> 3029.26]  And so, you're doing this.
[3029.26 --> 3059.24]  And so, you're doing this.
[3059.24 --> 3089.22]  You're doing this.
[3089.22 --> 3119.20]  And so, you're doing this.
[3119.20 --> 3149.18]  And so, you're doing this.
[3149.22 --> 3179.18]  So, you're doing this.
[3179.18 --> 3209.16]  And so, you're doing this.
[3209.16 --> 3239.14]  And so, you're doing this.
[3239.14 --> 3269.12]  And so, you're doing this.
[3269.12 --> 3299.10]  And so, you're doing this.
[3299.10 --> 3329.08]  So, you're doing this.
[3329.08 --> 3359.06]  And so, you're doing this.
[3359.06 --> 3389.04]  And so, you're doing this.
[3389.04 --> 3419.02]  And so, you're doing this.
[3419.04 --> 3449.02]  And so, you're doing this.
[3449.02 --> 3479.00]  And so, you're doing this.
[3479.00 --> 3508.98]  And so, you're doing this.
[3508.98 --> 3538.96]  And so, you're doing this.
[3538.96 --> 3568.94]  And so, you're doing this.
[3568.94 --> 3598.92]  And so, you're doing this.
[3598.92 --> 3628.90]  And so, you're doing this.
[3628.90 --> 3658.88]  And so, you're doing this.
[3658.88 --> 3688.86]  And so, you're doing this.
[3688.86 --> 3718.84]  And so, you're doing this.
[3718.84 --> 3748.82]  So, you're doing this.
[3748.82 --> 3778.80]  And so, you're doing this.
[3778.80 --> 3808.78]  And so, you're doing this.
[3808.78 --> 3838.76]  And so, you're doing this.
[3838.76 --> 3868.74]  And so, you're doing this.
[3868.74 --> 3871.12]  just maybe our ethnic background, right?
[3871.20 --> 3875.12]  God loves us better if we're from, you know, white or black
[3875.12 --> 3877.60]  or from this country or that country, right?
[3877.62 --> 3878.34]  It's not the way it works.
[3879.88 --> 3880.92]  Here's the last one.
[3880.98 --> 3881.98]  This one's a little bit more tricky.
[3883.60 --> 3884.08]  Faith.
[3886.32 --> 3887.58]  Faith is excluded.
[3887.86 --> 3889.20]  What do I mean by that?
[3890.76 --> 3894.80]  We know as Christians that we are not saved by our morality or good works.
[3895.04 --> 3898.40]  We know we can't trust our knowledge or our feelings.
[3898.74 --> 3900.78]  We know that God is the God of all people.
[3902.22 --> 3905.42]  But isn't faith the distinguishing mark of a Christian?
[3907.18 --> 3907.32]  Right?
[3907.44 --> 3910.66]  And so if asked, if pressed, we might say,
[3910.80 --> 3914.16]  well, the reason I am going to heaven and someone else is not
[3914.16 --> 3916.90]  is because I put my faith in Jesus Christ.
[3918.28 --> 3920.08]  And so we talk about saving faith and we say,
[3920.18 --> 3922.52]  it's my faith that saves me.
[3925.10 --> 3925.90]  Is that right?
[3928.74 --> 3932.58]  If that is the way God's salvation works,
[3932.78 --> 3934.62]  faith becomes something that you or I do.
[3935.78 --> 3938.54]  And therefore, we have grounds to boast.
[3939.98 --> 3941.96]  I can boast that I have faith.
[3943.20 --> 3946.06]  Isn't that wonderful that I am a person of faith?
[3946.56 --> 3949.30]  Maybe that other person, they're not so much a person of faith,
[3949.36 --> 3949.96]  but I am.
[3949.96 --> 3952.20]  Do you see the problem?
[3954.90 --> 3958.24]  And so also, I want to stop here also and pause and acknowledge something.
[3958.86 --> 3962.82]  That for some of you, you're listening to all of these things that are excluded,
[3963.22 --> 3964.98]  that people boast in, and you're thinking,
[3965.14 --> 3966.54]  this doesn't apply to me at all.
[3967.64 --> 3969.78]  And the reason you might think that is because
[3969.78 --> 3973.42]  you don't see yourself as better than others in any way
[3973.42 --> 3976.26]  as being good or more knowledgeable
[3976.26 --> 3980.46]  or more touch with your feelings or whatever.
[3981.58 --> 3984.40]  But instead, actually, you might despair
[3984.40 --> 3986.46]  because of your lack of faith,
[3986.56 --> 3988.86]  because of your struggles in the spiritual life.
[3990.00 --> 3992.16]  And so maybe when you look at yourself in the mirror,
[3992.30 --> 3994.50]  you're convinced that there is something about you
[3994.50 --> 3996.16]  or there is something you have done
[3996.16 --> 3998.86]  that makes you unacceptable to God.
[3998.86 --> 4002.44]  And you think you can never be a child of God,
[4002.54 --> 4003.24]  and you despair.
[4003.92 --> 4005.62]  Instead of boast, you actually despair.
[4006.64 --> 4008.58]  But what I want us to see is that
[4008.58 --> 4010.44]  boasting about your spiritual life
[4010.44 --> 4013.42]  and despairing about your spiritual life
[4013.42 --> 4015.06]  both come from the same root.
[4016.38 --> 4018.48]  In both cases, you're focusing on yourself,
[4019.06 --> 4022.32]  what you're doing or what you're failing at,
[4022.86 --> 4024.74]  what you're proud of, what you're ashamed of.
[4025.80 --> 4026.86]  And so what's the solution?
[4026.86 --> 4029.88]  The solution is stop looking at yourself at all
[4029.88 --> 4032.08]  and instead look to Jesus.
[4033.58 --> 4036.90]  Because it's not our faith that saves us.
[4037.96 --> 4041.30]  It's not the lack of faith that saves us.
[4041.36 --> 4043.18]  What saves us is the object of our faith.
[4043.92 --> 4045.88]  That's a very important distinction to make.
[4046.14 --> 4047.90]  Yes, we are saved through faith,
[4048.30 --> 4049.78]  not because of faith.
[4050.82 --> 4050.98]  Okay?
[4052.50 --> 4054.12]  So let me say this again.
[4054.12 --> 4057.62]  Again, it's not our faith that saves us.
[4057.80 --> 4061.06]  It is the object of our faith that saves us.
[4061.10 --> 4063.44]  In other words, it is Jesus that saves us.
[4064.08 --> 4065.82]  So let me give you an illustration of this
[4065.82 --> 4067.42]  that I heard from Pastor Tim Keller.
[4068.04 --> 4068.56]  He says,
[4068.62 --> 4071.00]  imagine you're standing on the edge of a tall cliff
[4071.00 --> 4073.62]  and you slip,
[4074.10 --> 4075.42]  you lose your footing,
[4075.42 --> 4076.64]  and you begin to fall.
[4076.64 --> 4079.06]  And just beside you,
[4079.10 --> 4080.32]  as you're falling down this cliff,
[4080.40 --> 4081.56]  a branch is sticking out.
[4083.86 --> 4085.40]  How are you going to be saved?
[4086.28 --> 4087.10]  That's the question.
[4087.24 --> 4088.42]  What is going to save you?
[4089.32 --> 4092.38]  Well, it's not really about how much faith you have
[4092.38 --> 4093.22]  in that branch,
[4093.28 --> 4095.94]  how much you trust the reliability of that branch.
[4096.00 --> 4099.00]  What saves you is the strength of the branch.
[4099.00 --> 4101.52]  And in a similar way,
[4101.58 --> 4103.18]  it's not the strength of your faith.
[4103.46 --> 4104.48]  It's not your faith,
[4104.76 --> 4106.96]  but it's the object of your faith
[4106.96 --> 4107.96]  that actually saves you.
[4108.00 --> 4109.64]  It's what you put your faith in.
[4110.48 --> 4111.36]  And so when you're falling
[4111.36 --> 4113.24]  and your only hope is that branch,
[4114.22 --> 4116.40]  it's not your trust in the branch that saves you.
[4116.52 --> 4118.20]  It is the branch that saves you.
[4119.08 --> 4121.34]  It's the branch that you put your trust in.
[4121.34 --> 4124.46]  And so it's not good enough
[4124.46 --> 4127.34]  to be sincere in your faith
[4127.34 --> 4130.34]  because maybe instead of a branch,
[4130.42 --> 4131.64]  you grab onto a twig.
[4132.78 --> 4135.46]  And you can have as much faith as you want in that twig.
[4136.06 --> 4139.36]  You can have very strong and very sincere faith
[4139.36 --> 4142.52]  in that twig and be sincerely wrong
[4142.52 --> 4146.38]  because that twig is going to snap
[4146.38 --> 4149.00]  and it's not strong enough to actually save you.
[4150.06 --> 4151.12]  Okay, so do you see the distinction?
[4151.34 --> 4155.70]  And when you put your trust in anything
[4155.70 --> 4159.56]  that is not Jesus to save you,
[4160.26 --> 4163.08]  then that's that you're in trouble
[4163.08 --> 4166.88]  because what saves you is not faith itself.
[4167.42 --> 4169.06]  It's what you put your faith in.
[4170.08 --> 4171.90]  That's what needs to be strong enough
[4171.90 --> 4175.02]  and reliable enough and trustworthy enough.
[4175.72 --> 4177.76]  So friends, this is what biblical faith is.
[4177.88 --> 4178.88]  What is biblical faith?
[4178.88 --> 4180.72]  It's knowing that there is absolutely
[4180.72 --> 4184.14]  you have no capacity on your own to save yourself
[4184.14 --> 4186.56]  from sin, from the penalty of sin.
[4187.08 --> 4190.10]  And it's knowing that Jesus alone can save you.
[4190.46 --> 4192.20]  And then it's receiving that by faith.
[4193.04 --> 4195.50]  And that's why boasting is excluded.
[4195.50 --> 4199.38]  Paul says in Philippians chapter 3
[4199.38 --> 4202.14]  that there are certain things that caused him to boast.
[4203.62 --> 4203.72]  Right?
[4203.82 --> 4204.80]  Paul used to boast.
[4205.64 --> 4206.76]  He used to be very proud
[4206.76 --> 4208.84]  of the tribe of Benjamin
[4208.84 --> 4211.58]  in regard to the law,
[4211.86 --> 4212.84]  a Pharisee,
[4213.22 --> 4215.30]  as for righteousness based on the law,
[4215.86 --> 4216.58]  faultless.
[4216.58 --> 4219.82]  He's not lying.
[4222.30 --> 4224.44]  Now, and there is nothing wrong with being a Pharisee
[4224.44 --> 4225.42]  if that is what you are.
[4226.76 --> 4228.98]  There's nothing wrong with being born of the tribe of Benjamin.
[4229.10 --> 4230.64]  There's nothing wrong with following the law.
[4231.42 --> 4233.28]  What is wrong with those things,
[4233.92 --> 4236.86]  what can be deadly wrong with those things,
[4237.42 --> 4240.94]  is that if they replace faith in Christ,
[4240.94 --> 4244.16]  if they become matters of spiritual pride.
[4245.08 --> 4247.16]  And that's why Paul goes on to say this,
[4247.18 --> 4248.16]  and we're ending with this.
[4248.50 --> 4249.52]  Philippians chapter 3.
[4250.34 --> 4251.44]  Let me read this for us.
[4252.12 --> 4254.26]  But whatever were gains to me,
[4255.14 --> 4258.10]  I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
[4259.20 --> 4262.08]  What is more, I consider everything a loss
[4262.08 --> 4264.22]  because of the surpassing worth
[4264.22 --> 4266.54]  of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,
[4266.82 --> 4268.64]  for whose sake I have lost all things.
[4268.64 --> 4271.88]  I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ
[4271.88 --> 4273.84]  and be found in him,
[4273.90 --> 4275.72]  not having a righteousness of my own
[4275.72 --> 4276.84]  that comes from the law,
[4277.00 --> 4279.06]  but that which is through faith in Christ,
[4279.14 --> 4281.68]  the righteousness that comes from God
[4281.68 --> 4283.90]  on the basis of faith.
[4286.36 --> 4289.34]  Is there anything you contribute to your salvation?
[4291.38 --> 4291.98]  Yes.
[4293.44 --> 4294.50]  Your sin.
[4296.08 --> 4298.48]  The sin that made it necessary.
[4298.64 --> 4301.44]  After that, there is nothing else for you to contribute
[4301.44 --> 4304.30]  because Jesus has done everything necessary
[4304.30 --> 4306.16]  to make us right with God.
[4307.28 --> 4308.76]  Will you please pray with me?
[4312.78 --> 4315.36]  Lord, we thank you for these words in Romans.
[4316.54 --> 4321.14]  We confess that justification rids us of boasting.
[4321.96 --> 4325.66]  And yet boasting still manages to find its way into our lives.
[4325.66 --> 4329.58]  And so, Lord, would you strip us of anything in our lives
[4329.58 --> 4330.68]  that we would boast in,
[4331.14 --> 4332.60]  that we would say,
[4332.80 --> 4334.00]  here, Lord, look at me.
[4334.78 --> 4336.48]  And would you humble all of us
[4336.48 --> 4340.64]  so that our lives would be marked by this grace-based humility,
[4341.00 --> 4343.26]  and that if we boast in anything,
[4343.32 --> 4345.52]  like Paul, it would be in Christ alone
[4345.52 --> 4346.72]  in what he has done for us.
[4347.82 --> 4352.02]  Make us ever and ever more dependent on you,
[4352.02 --> 4354.66]  trusting in you and your trustworthiness,
[4355.06 --> 4355.84]  your reliability,
[4356.14 --> 4356.84]  your power
[4356.84 --> 4360.28]  to save to the utmost those who look to you.
[4360.94 --> 4362.12]  We pray in Jesus' name.
[4362.62 --> 4362.86]  Amen.
[4369.18 --> 4370.34]  Let's stand to sing.
[4370.34 --> 4396.38]  Come, behold, our wondrous peace,
[4396.38 --> 4401.26]  sing, in the love, in all the things.
[4401.26 --> 4405.68]  In the theme of heaven's praises,
[4406.14 --> 4409.16]  for deep trail humanity.
[4410.74 --> 4414.66]  In our longing, in our darkness,
[4415.22 --> 4419.26]  now the light of life has come.
[4419.66 --> 4423.38]  Look to Christ, who our descendant,
[4423.38 --> 4429.38]  took our flesh to rest upon you.
[4434.38 --> 4438.38]  Come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4439.34 --> 4442.38]  be the perfect Son of man.
[4443.66 --> 4446.38]  In the living of his suffering,
[4447.96 --> 4451.38]  in the strength of sin,
[4451.38 --> 4456.26]  sing, in the love, in all the things.
[4456.26 --> 4458.26]  Come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4458.26 --> 4464.26]  come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4464.26 --> 4467.26]  come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4467.26 --> 4470.26]  Christ, where our Lord is the same.
[4474.26 --> 4480.04]  Come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4480.04 --> 4484.92]  Christ, who our Lord is the same.
[4484.92 --> 4486.92]  Come, behold, our wondrous mystery,
[4486.92 --> 4487.92]  in the stead of ruin,
[4487.92 --> 4488.86]  and still,
[4488.86 --> 4492.92]  change the Lamb in victory.
[4492.92 --> 4498.04]  See the pride of our redemption,
[4498.92 --> 4502.92]  see the Father's plan of hope,
[4502.92 --> 4503.80]  bringing our joy,
[4503.80 --> 4504.80]  bringing praise,
[4504.80 --> 4505.80]  bringing praise,
[4505.80 --> 4506.80]  and glory,
[4506.80 --> 4507.80]  bringing praise,
[4507.80 --> 4508.80]  and glory,
[4508.80 --> 4509.80]  and glory,
[4509.80 --> 4510.80]  and glory.
[4510.80 --> 4513.60]  as now.
[4525.68 --> 4531.68]  and glory,
[4531.68 --> 4533.68]  when we live in our storage,
[4533.68 --> 4544.78]  What a fortune to deliver us, how a miracle of hope.
[4544.78 --> 4554.14]  Christ in hell will be resurrected, as there will be life in Christ.
[4554.52 --> 4563.30]  What a fortune to deliver us, how a miracle of hope.
[4563.68 --> 4575.82]  Christ in hell will be resurrected, as there will be life in Christ.
[4575.82 --> 4576.82]  Amen.
[4576.82 --> 4586.06]  Let me see.
[4586.06 --> 4587.06]  Amen.
[4587.06 --> 4588.06]  Amen.
[4588.06 --> 4589.06]  Amen.
[4589.06 --> 4590.06]  Amen.
[4590.06 --> 4591.06]  Amen.
[4591.06 --> 4598.20]  So one way we respond to learning about what God has done for us in Christ is by giving
[4598.20 --> 4605.88]  of our tithes and offerings, not as a way to boast, not as a way to make sure God is pleased
[4605.88 --> 4609.44]  with us, but as a response to what God has done.
[4609.92 --> 4613.76]  And our designated offering for this morning is for our local church ministries.
[4614.70 --> 4618.74]  And may I invite the deacons to come forward to collect the offering?
[4618.74 --> 4619.74]  Amen.
[4619.74 --> 4620.74]  Amen.
[4620.74 --> 4621.74]  Amen.
[4621.74 --> 4622.74]  Amen.
[4622.74 --> 4626.74]  I'd like to share a song, Like a River Glorious, that many of you know.
[4626.74 --> 4630.74]  And there's a phrase in there that fits with what we've been talking.
[4630.74 --> 4633.88]  It says, those who trust him fully, all for us to do.
[4633.88 --> 4635.88]  There's nothing else for us to do.
[4635.88 --> 4639.78]  And those that trust him fully find him fully true.
[4639.78 --> 4669.76]  There's nothing else for us to do.
[4669.78 --> 4670.78]  Amen.
[4699.78 --> 4701.78]  Amen.
[4729.78 --> 4731.78]  Amen.
[4759.78 --> 4761.78]  Amen.
[4789.78 --> 4806.78]  Amen.
[4818.78 --> 4819.76]  Thank you, Paul.
[4819.78 --> 4825.66]  So please join me in prayer as we bring our prayers to the Lord.
[4826.24 --> 4832.54]  And I'm going to begin with reading some scripture from Psalm 28 and kind of bookend our prayer with Psalm 28.
[4832.74 --> 4835.62]  But please bow your heads, close your eyes, and join me.
[4838.44 --> 4840.82]  To you, Lord, I call.
[4841.88 --> 4842.92]  You are my rock.
[4844.06 --> 4845.82]  Do not turn a deaf ear to me.
[4845.82 --> 4851.02]  For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.
[4852.18 --> 4856.56]  Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help.
[4857.12 --> 4861.68]  As I lift up my hands toward your most holy place.
[4863.20 --> 4867.24]  Lord, we do thank you that you care for us.
[4867.76 --> 4871.58]  That you care for your church, your people.
[4871.58 --> 4875.94]  And that you even care and sustain the world around us.
[4876.36 --> 4878.24]  And give life to all.
[4879.22 --> 4881.06]  You are the ground of life.
[4881.46 --> 4883.30]  And you all things have their existence.
[4884.66 --> 4888.46]  And your rule and your reign of this world will never end.
[4889.32 --> 4890.34]  We praise you, Lord.
[4891.22 --> 4894.10]  We praise you for the world around us.
[4894.18 --> 4895.82]  We pray for the world around us, I mean.
[4895.82 --> 4900.24]  And especially, we pray for those who do not yet know you.
[4900.60 --> 4906.06]  Do not know that you would call a people to yourself.
[4906.68 --> 4909.32]  So, Lord, we ask that you would reveal yourself to them.
[4909.78 --> 4912.26]  That we would be the aroma of Christ in the world.
[4912.56 --> 4914.46]  To our neighbors, our friends, our family.
[4916.56 --> 4919.56]  Lord, we pray that you would help us to be a witness to this world.
[4919.56 --> 4925.46]  Help us to reach out, not only by spreading the news of Christ,
[4925.58 --> 4929.26]  but also to serve people whom we rub shoulders with each day.
[4929.82 --> 4933.78]  To show kindness to even those we consider our enemies.
[4934.70 --> 4937.76]  As you loved us and saved us when we were opposing you.
[4938.74 --> 4943.80]  Help us to be a forgiving people who keep a short record of wrongs.
[4943.80 --> 4947.36]  We pray for our church, Lord.
[4947.64 --> 4951.30]  As today we took up our offering for our church ministries.
[4951.46 --> 4954.42]  We pray that you would bless our local church ministries.
[4954.94 --> 4957.66]  Would you use all of these things that we do, Lord,
[4957.74 --> 4962.30]  to build up your people so that we would more fully trust in you.
[4962.52 --> 4967.16]  And that you would use also these ministries to draw more people to yourself.
[4967.16 --> 4969.56]  That we might know our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[4970.42 --> 4973.30]  We pray, Lord, that you would help each of us.
[4974.36 --> 4977.94]  At Latter CRC to be more faithful to you.
[4978.32 --> 4979.28]  In serving you.
[4979.72 --> 4980.88]  In living for your glory.
[4981.66 --> 4985.06]  Help us, Lord, to grow in our love for one another as a church family.
[4985.24 --> 4986.96]  Knit us together by the Holy Spirit.
[4988.02 --> 4989.64]  Unified in a common faith.
[4990.48 --> 4992.38]  Help us, Lord, to minister to one another.
[4992.38 --> 4996.16]  Not to be just always looking inward.
[4996.78 --> 4999.32]  But also, Lord, to look outward to those around us.
[5000.30 --> 5001.86]  As, Lord, many of us are doing.
[5001.96 --> 5002.88]  And we thank you for that.
[5003.80 --> 5005.70]  Give us, Lord, the grace of Christ.
[5006.56 --> 5008.64]  Help us to turn from our sinful ways.
[5009.28 --> 5013.06]  And to grow more and more into the beautiful image of our Lord Jesus.
[5014.64 --> 5017.62]  And, Lord, we pray for particular people that come to mind this morning.
[5017.62 --> 5019.20]  That are in our hearts.
[5020.78 --> 5023.08]  Please, Lord, heal those who are sick and suffering.
[5023.08 --> 5025.78]  Who are weak, weary, and wounded.
[5025.78 --> 5031.82]  We especially, Lord, pray for Connie Graham and Grace Koistra as they are in the hospital.
[5032.64 --> 5035.24]  Lord, they need your healing hand upon them.
[5035.24 --> 5040.00]  We ask, Lord, for your help as the doctors seek to understand what is wrong.
[5040.00 --> 5043.50]  And that you would be the Lord ultimately who heals.
[5043.84 --> 5044.74]  Help them each day.
[5045.88 --> 5048.42]  Bring them, Lord, relief and healing.
[5049.42 --> 5051.32]  We pray, Lord, for others who are sick.
[5052.20 --> 5055.04]  Please bring them back to be with us here on Sundays.
[5055.04 --> 5061.06]  And, Lord, we pray for those who have suffered loss in recent times.
[5061.58 --> 5071.60]  Lord, we know that there are other churches in the lower mainland who have lost people who are very pillars in their community just recently.
[5071.60 --> 5073.42]  Lord, we lift up them to you as well.
[5076.00 --> 5080.56]  Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.
[5081.52 --> 5083.36]  The Lord is my strength and my shield.
[5084.02 --> 5086.28]  My heart trusts in him and he helps me.
[5087.06 --> 5089.90]  My heart leaps for joy and with my song I praise him.
[5090.48 --> 5092.60]  The Lord is the strength of his people.
[5093.22 --> 5096.18]  A fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
[5096.88 --> 5099.38]  Save your people and bless your inheritance.
[5099.88 --> 5101.02]  Be their shepherd.
[5101.60 --> 5102.74]  And carry them forever.
[5103.44 --> 5104.58]  We pray in Christ's name.
[5104.98 --> 5105.26]  Amen.
[5107.06 --> 5107.82]  Let's stand.
[5108.56 --> 5114.52]  And I want to invite you to join us for a time of fellowship in the fellowship hall with coffee.
[5115.10 --> 5119.20]  And a chance to catch up on one another's lives and get to know one another.
[5119.94 --> 5124.24]  Especially if there's someone you don't know or who's new, please reach out to them and get to know them.
[5124.38 --> 5124.90]  Welcome them.
[5125.48 --> 5128.22]  And I invite you to hold out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[5129.40 --> 5131.40]  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5132.34 --> 5136.04]  May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5136.38 --> 5139.78]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[5140.48 --> 5140.82]  Amen.
[5141.74 --> 5144.52]  Please remain standing and we'll sing our final song.
[5144.52 --> 5158.74]  Gee, you all the coolness of Eden.
[5158.74 --> 5161.92]  And we'll sing along.
[5161.92 --> 5169.36]  Be, O my mission, O Lord of my heart,
[5169.36 --> 5176.40]  Call me all to eternal world.
[5176.40 --> 5184.18]  I will be, O Lord, my name, my name,
[5184.18 --> 5194.18]  O Lord, be, O the name that presents my life.
[5194.18 --> 5202.18]  Be, O my wisdom, and O my sweet word.
[5202.18 --> 5209.18]  I am here with me, O thou with me, Lord.
[5209.18 --> 5217.18]  I am here with me, O Lord, my name, to stand.
[5217.18 --> 5227.18]  And with me, O Lord, my name, I will be mine.
[5227.18 --> 5235.18]  I am here with me, O Lord, my victory, O Lord.
[5235.18 --> 5243.18]  May I, O my wisdom, and O my wisdom,
[5243.18 --> 5251.18]  All the high, O Lord, will ever be mine.
[5251.18 --> 5261.18]  Fill me, my wisdom, and O my love.
[5261.18 --> 5267.18]  I am here with me, O Lord, my with me.
[5267.18 --> 5271.18]  I am here with us, I am here with me, O Lord.
[5271.18 --> 5275.18]  The Lord will ever be mine.
[5275.18 --> 5279.18]  I am here with us, and I will ever be mine.
[5279.18 --> 5309.16]  Thank you.
