[488.00 → 492.00] Well, friends, it's an honour to welcome you to Ladder Christian Reformed Church.
[492.00 → 500.00] And it was good to be with the family for a minute and to see that there are almost as many children as adults.
[500.00 → 502.00] So that was, that's fun.
[502.00 → 508.00] And I want to thank you for being here on behalf of the Iron family for your presence here today.
[508.00 → 514.00] And I know this is a tremendous encouragement to all of them that you are here.
[514.00 → 521.00] And we are here to grieve Jerry and Ann's loss.
[521.00 → 527.00] And yet, we rejoice and hope that they have found rest in the Lord.
[527.00 → 534.00] And so this service will mark both of those things, both grief and joy.
[534.00 → 544.00] And so, both Thanksgiving for their lives and longing and hope in our Lord Jesus Christ who conquered death.
[544.00 → 548.00] And brought life immortal to all those who trust in him.
[548.00 → 551.00] And so, this is a time of worship.
[551.00 → 555.00] And as we begin our worship today, would you please join me in prayer?
[555.00 → 558.00] We will ask for God's presence and for his blessing.
[558.00 → 560.00] Let's pray.
[560.00 → 573.00] Our great heavenly Father, we come to you this afternoon with hearts that are heavy, with hearts that sigh, with tears.
[573.00 → 576.00] And yet, we do not grieve as those without hope.
[576.00 → 581.00] We do not grieve as those without Thanksgiving.
[581.00 → 584.00] We thank you, Lord, for Jerry and Ann's life.
[584.00 → 596.00] We thank you for the life, even more so, of your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom Jerry and Ann are secure.
[596.00 → 601.00] Our Lord Jesus, who is indeed the resurrection and the life.
[601.00 → 605.00] God, would you be with us this afternoon in this service.
[605.00 → 608.00] Lord, would you comfort all those who sorrow.
[608.00 → 617.00] Strengthen us in our grief as we look to you, as we trust in you, and as we lift our hearts to you.
[617.00 → 620.00] Lord, would you walk with us this day and every day.
[620.00 → 623.00] We ask this all in Christ's name.
[623.00 → 624.00] Amen.
[624.00 → 635.00] So, I want to begin by reading some words of comfort that come from the Bible.
[635.00 → 639.00] And one from our confession, the Heidelberg Catechism.
[639.00 → 643.00] So first, from the Gospel of John, Jesus said,
[643.00 → 646.00] I am the resurrection and the life.
[646.00 → 652.00] The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.
[652.00 → 657.00] And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[657.00 → 661.00] The first question of the Heidelberg Catechism asks,
[661.00 → 665.00] What is your only hope in life and in death?
[665.00 → 667.00] And here's the answer.
[667.00 → 678.00] That I am not my own, but belong, body and soul, in life and in death, to my faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[678.00 → 680.00] Amen.
[680.00 → 686.00] Let's all stand as we sing our first two songs this afternoon.
[686.00 → 689.00] And the first one is called, Christ is Mine Forevermore.
[689.00 → 704.00] Mine are days that God has numbered.
[704.00 → 705.00] I was made to walk with Him.
[705.00 → 721.00] Yet I look for worldly treasure, and forsake the King of kings.
[721.00 → 726.00] But mine is hope in my Redeemer.
[726.00 → 731.00] Though I fall His office show.
[731.00 → 736.00] For Christ has paid for every failing.
[736.00 → 740.00] I am His forevermore.
[740.00 → 753.00] Mine are tears in times of sorrow, darkness not yet understood.
[753.00 → 763.00] Through the valley I must travel, where I see no earthly good.
[763.00 → 768.00] But mine is peace that flows from heaven.
[768.00 → 773.00] And the strength in times of need.
[773.00 → 778.00] I know my pain will not be wasted.
[778.00 → 783.00] Christ completes His work in me.
[783.00 → 791.00] Mine are days here as a stranger.
[791.00 → 796.00] Pilgrim on a narrow way.
[796.00 → 801.00] One with Christ I will encounter.
[801.00 → 806.00] Nor men hatred for His name.
[806.00 → 811.00] But mine is armour for this battle.
[811.00 → 816.00] Strong enough to last the war.
[816.00 → 821.00] And He has said He will deliver.
[821.00 → 826.00] Safely to the golden shore.
[826.00 → 832.00] And mine are keys to Zion City.
[832.00 → 837.00] Where beside the King I walk.
[837.00 → 842.00] For there my heart has found its treasure.
[842.00 → 847.00] Christ is mine forevermore.
[847.00 → 869.00] Lord, and then He will number ram étude,
[869.00 → 870.00] On the coast of Jerusalem, again the unbelief.
[870.00 → 872.66] Come, O my soul
[872.66 → 877.76] For his love is my reward
[877.76 → 882.72] Fear is gone and hope is sure
[882.72 → 887.94] Christ is mine forevermore
[887.94 → 893.06] Come, rejoice now, O my soul
[893.06 → 898.34] For his love is my reward
[898.34 → 903.44] Fear is gone and hope is sure
[903.44 → 909.92] Christ is mine forevermore
[909.92 → 916.88] And mine are keys to Zion City
[916.88 → 921.76] Where beside the King I walk
[921.76 → 927.58] For there my heart has found its treasure
[927.58 → 932.68] Christ is mine forevermore
[932.68 → 938.18] Christ is mine forevermore
[938.18 → 943.68] Christ is mine forevermore
[943.68 → 948.78] My hope is built on nothing less
[948.78 → 969.88] I hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[969.88 → 974.98] I dare not trust the sweetest faith
[974.98 → 980.08] God, holy, lean on Jesus' name
[980.08 → 985.36] On Christ the solid rock I stand
[985.36 → 990.46] All other ground is sinking sand
[990.46 → 995.56] All other ground is sinking sand
[995.56 → 1002.82] When darkness veils his lovely face
[1002.82 → 1007.66] I rest on his unchanging grace
[1007.66 → 1012.36] In every high and stormy gale
[1012.36 → 1017.46] My anger holds within the veil
[1017.46 → 1022.96] On Christ the solid rock I stand
[1022.96 → 1028.06] All other ground is sinking sand
[1028.06 → 1033.06] All other ground is sinking sand
[1033.06 → 1040.16] His oath, his covenant, his blood
[1040.16 → 1041.16] His oath, his covenant, his blood
[1041.16 → 1045.16] Support me in the overwhelming flood
[1045.16 → 1046.16] When all around life is sinking sand
[1046.16 → 1050.26] When all around life is sinking sand
[1050.26 → 1055.36] He then is on my hope and stay
[1055.36 → 1060.36] On Christ the solid rock I stand
[1060.36 → 1063.36] All other ground is sinking sand
[1063.36 → 1066.36] All other ground is sinking sand
[1066.36 → 1071.46] All other ground is sinking sand
[1071.46 → 1078.46] When he shall come with trumpet sound
[1078.46 → 1083.46] O may I then in him be found
[1083.46 → 1088.46] Dressed in his righteousness alone
[1088.46 → 1093.46] Bootless to stand before the throne
[1093.46 → 1098.56] On Christ the solid rock I stand
[1098.56 → 1103.56] All other ground is sinking sand
[1103.56 → 1109.56] All other ground is sinking sand
[1109.56 → 1113.56] All other ground is sinking sand
[1113.56 → 1116.76] All other ground is sinking sand
[1116.76 → 1133.76] So we are about to go into a sweet
[1133.76 → 1136.36] A special time of remembrance
[1136.36 → 1143.68] and we will have Betty Ann and Wayne, daughter and son of Jerry and Ann,
[1144.36 → 1149.28] and also their friend Joe Skulk will be coming up and sharing some remembrances.
[1150.34 → 1152.62] So I'll turn it over to you guys.
[1166.36 → 1175.80] Thank you everyone for coming to help us remember Mum and Dad today.
[1180.28 → 1189.48] Our parents, Jerry and Ann, were both born in Holland and met actually through Mum's older brother, Belle.
[1189.48 → 1197.06] They were in the army together and Belle took him home for a visit and that's where he met our mum.
[1197.84 → 1206.26] They immigrated to Canada in 1957, after marrying in Holland of course,
[1206.76 → 1209.20] along with Dad's brother John and his wife Annie.
[1209.60 → 1214.68] They joined sister Jos and her husband Bill and their children who were already living here.
[1214.68 → 1222.24] Dad began working at Culture and Marsh Machine Shop, which he later purchased as each partner retired.
[1222.98 → 1226.12] Mum took on some cleaning jobs to help support the family.
[1226.94 → 1230.40] Life in Canada was good, but something was missing.
[1232.50 → 1237.56] So, Mum and Dad, two words we often take for granted.
[1239.02 → 1241.02] As children, we certainly did.
[1241.02 → 1246.26] But as we became adults and got married, had families of our own,
[1246.82 → 1251.68] we came to fully realize how blessed we were to have the parents we did.
[1253.74 → 1254.78] Think about it.
[1255.84 → 1261.42] Three little babies, born into situations where their birth parents couldn't care for them.
[1262.48 → 1266.24] And then Jerry and Ann, a couple who couldn't have children of their own.
[1267.12 → 1268.52] But God had a plan.
[1268.52 → 1271.76] They prayerfully decided to adopt.
[1272.12 → 1276.46] And in 1962, they welcomed their first child, me.
[1276.80 → 1281.80] And a couple of years later, they travelled to Victoria to bring home Wayne.
[1283.08 → 1286.04] And a few years after that, Peter joined our family.
[1287.22 → 1290.60] Rumour has it that in the beginning, when they started having children,
[1290.80 → 1293.24] they went a little crazy with happiness at first.
[1293.24 → 1301.24] We had a wonderful childhood, filled with family outings, camping trips, and countless happy memories.
[1302.24 → 1307.28] Mum and Dad were always there to guide and support us through good times and hard times.
[1308.00 → 1312.56] They trusted God to lead them and instill that same trust in us.
[1312.56 → 1315.60] Mum was a true homemaker.
[1315.60 → 1319.76] She made our homes warm and welcoming, always baking and cooking.
[1320.44 → 1325.02] And if sewing needed to be done, well, she preferred to call Tactics for that.
[1326.62 → 1328.48] The two of them would often trade.
[1328.86 → 1329.58] Mum would bake.
[1330.00 → 1331.10] Tactics would sew.
[1331.10 → 1340.18] Dad was ever-present, driving us to sports practices, music lessons, and church activities.
[1340.88 → 1343.52] He was deeply involved in our lives and our community.
[1344.30 → 1349.18] Whether it was helping Wayne or Pete build bikes and cars, or running his machine shop,
[1349.74 → 1355.18] serving on the church council, volunteering with the board of the Ladder Christian School,
[1355.32 → 1358.44] or participating in the Ladder Businessmen's Association,
[1359.04 → 1361.08] Dad was always busy making a difference.
[1361.92 → 1363.08] He always said,
[1363.62 → 1366.10] You never get more out of life than you put into it.
[1367.42 → 1368.98] Okay, how many times he said that?
[1369.84 → 1374.48] In their empty Lester years, Mum volunteered with the hospital auxiliary,
[1374.94 → 1380.86] and she especially loved taking the snack cart around and chatting with patients and fellow volunteers.
[1381.88 → 1385.14] Then came the next joyous chapter, grandchildren.
[1386.14 → 1389.24] Mum and Dad relished this new phase of life.
[1389.24 → 1394.48] Their backyard often echoed with the laughter of eight little grandchildren running and playing.
[1394.86 → 1397.16] There were many sleepovers and camping trips.
[1397.92 → 1400.02] OMA baked and did crafts with the kids.
[1400.44 → 1403.46] And when OPA retired, he turned the garage into a workshop,
[1404.02 → 1406.90] building wooden tractors and trucks with each grandchild.
[1406.90 → 1412.22] The garage was so active that at one point we joked that it was knee-deep in sawdust.
[1414.22 → 1421.58] In retirement, they travelled together often, cruises to Alaska, visits to Hawaii, a meaningful trip to Israel.
[1421.58 → 1428.36] But their favourite adventures were in their RV, exploring Canada, the Yukon, and the United States together.
[1429.40 → 1435.80] As time passed, and with age catching up, maintaining their home of over 50 years became more challenging.
[1435.80 → 1443.66] They moved to Augustine House on Arthur Drive and truly enjoyed their time there, especially welcoming visitors.
[1444.42 → 1448.68] But when COVID hit in 2020, isolation was hard on them.
[1449.82 → 1457.04] In June 2021, on the Father's Day weekend, my husband Don and I were finally able to visit them in person again.
[1457.04 → 1459.56] We celebrated with a dinner out.
[1460.24 → 1462.82] That night, Dad felt unwell but brushed it off.
[1462.90 → 1466.16] And the next day, we visited once more before heading home to the island.
[1467.02 → 1471.04] And sadly, on Monday morning, we got the call that Dad was having a stroke.
[1471.90 → 1473.52] That was a difficult time.
[1473.64 → 1475.90] Dad was in the hospital, and they had to be apart.
[1476.84 → 1481.50] The stroke left Dad with lasting effects, and they could no longer stay at Augustine House.
[1482.12 → 1485.68] We found them a new home at Peace Portal Seniors Village.
[1485.68 → 1489.20] And after some time, they were even able to share a room again.
[1490.76 → 1498.44] Wayne and Jeanette, Don and I would like to thank the staff at Peace Portal Seniors Village for their incredible care.
[1499.36 → 1503.00] Three of the ladies who cared for our parents are here today.
[1503.76 → 1512.20] Melissa, Danielle, and Rita, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness to OPA and OMA.
[1512.20 → 1514.98] You meant the world to them and to us.
[1516.54 → 1518.92] We know Mom and Dad touched many lives.
[1519.48 → 1521.72] Thank you for being here to celebrate theirs.
[1523.28 → 1525.42] We will miss our Mom and Dad deeply.
[1525.72 → 1529.02] They were the greatest gift God could have given us from the very beginning.
[1529.66 → 1535.54] And we are comforted in knowing they are together again in the presence of their Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1535.54 → 1565.52] Thank you.
[1565.54 → 1571.40] Thank you for sharing those memories with us.
[1571.40 → 1571.96] Thank you.
[1571.96 → 1572.02] Thank you.
[1572.02 → 1574.32] Thank you.
[1574.32 → 1577.56] Thank you.
[1577.56 → 1578.70] My name is Joe Chalk.
[1579.20 → 1582.00] I'm a long-time family friend of the Irons
[1582.00 → 1585.98] and certainly a close friend of Jerry and Anne's.
[1587.12 → 1589.24] My first memory of Jerry and Anne,
[1589.36 → 1594.88] I go back to the very first time I worshipped in this church.
[1595.02 → 1598.24] I attended here in early May 1983.
[1599.54 → 1602.22] And after the service, Jerry approached me
[1602.22 → 1604.78] and introduced himself and Anne
[1604.78 → 1607.46] and inquired about what I was doing there.
[1607.96 → 1609.86] And what I was all about.
[1610.62 → 1616.22] I told him that we had been transferred to the Lower Mainland
[1616.22 → 1619.94] and I was looking for a place that we could settle down
[1619.94 → 1621.44] here in the Lower Mainland.
[1622.30 → 1624.82] And his answer to me was,
[1625.54 → 1630.10] boy, you can't find a better place than this to live,
[1630.26 → 1631.26] right here in Ladder.
[1631.84 → 1633.88] And you should move here.
[1633.88 → 1638.08] I'll even help you find a place if you need one.
[1638.08 → 1640.00] Wow.
[1640.70 → 1641.58] What an offer.
[1643.54 → 1647.18] Something that he reminded me of several times over the many years
[1647.18 → 1648.98] that I visited with Jerry and Anne.
[1648.98 → 1653.22] As their zone elder, a number of years later,
[1654.04 → 1657.18] my first visit with Jerry and Anne was a delight.
[1657.94 → 1661.42] And what normally would have been an hour or so visit
[1661.42 → 1664.04] became about a three-hour journey.
[1664.04 → 1668.18] speaking about the Iron family,
[1668.18 → 1670.82] their presence here in Ladder,
[1671.76 → 1675.92] and getting a real picture also of the church family
[1675.92 → 1679.42] that Jerry and Anne were such an integral part of
[1679.42 → 1683.24] for most of their long married life.
[1684.62 → 1687.48] And they told me, many times over,
[1688.24 → 1689.40] how blessed they had been,
[1689.52 → 1691.70] first to immigrate to Canada
[1691.70 → 1693.88] and to this wonderful place,
[1694.42 → 1695.50] living here in Ladder,
[1696.20 → 1698.32] and about Jerry's hard work,
[1699.22 → 1700.80] eventually taking over the ownership
[1700.80 → 1702.72] of his beloved welding business,
[1703.62 → 1706.26] even his teaching at the local high school.
[1707.50 → 1712.28] But mostly, they talked of their children,
[1713.04 → 1714.20] their three loving children
[1714.20 → 1716.92] that he had been blessed with through adoption.
[1719.14 → 1721.06] That happened a few years
[1721.06 → 1722.88] after they moved here from the Netherlands.
[1724.80 → 1727.10] There were very few visits,
[1728.22 → 1729.76] and there were many visits,
[1730.66 → 1732.70] including those at Augustine House
[1732.70 → 1735.74] and at their Peace Portal Seniors Village home,
[1736.38 → 1739.18] where those children and their families,
[1739.86 → 1741.34] especially the families,
[1742.00 → 1743.42] especially the grandchildren
[1743.42 → 1745.78] and now great-grandchildren,
[1746.54 → 1748.00] were not always part
[1748.00 → 1751.24] of a major delight in their discussions.
[1751.64 → 1752.06] And yes,
[1753.16 → 1756.36] often talk about their start in Holland
[1756.36 → 1757.98] and the loved ones
[1757.98 → 1760.86] that, earlier on at least,
[1761.52 → 1763.16] were still there, left there.
[1765.40 → 1767.04] I was often reminded
[1767.04 → 1768.74] that it was time for a visit.
[1769.70 → 1772.78] It was like Anna had marked the calendar.
[1774.26 → 1776.16] I even once received a call from Jerry
[1776.16 → 1777.86] to come out for a visit.
[1778.00 → 1781.62] That visit was at Bridle Falls,
[1782.42 → 1784.30] where they were camped with other friends.
[1784.56 → 1785.10] Jerry said,
[1785.62 → 1786.42] it was important.
[1786.54 → 1788.70] We have something important to discuss,
[1788.82 → 1789.62] a pressing matter.
[1791.00 → 1793.30] It turned out to be a glass of wine
[1793.30 → 1795.14] with a few friends
[1795.14 → 1796.80] who were celebrating a birthday.
[1796.80 → 1806.18] I've reviewed many historical minutes
[1806.18 → 1809.80] and documents lately relative to Ladder CRC,
[1810.50 → 1812.56] who celebrates 75th,
[1812.82 → 1816.36] their 75th anniversary later this year.
[1816.36 → 1818.98] It's astounding to me
[1818.98 → 1820.54] to see G.
[1820.54 → 1821.28] Crohn
[1821.28 → 1825.10] as name on many sets of minutes
[1825.10 → 1826.20] over many years,
[1827.14 → 1827.98] acting in his capacity
[1828.52 → 1830.24] as clerk of council,
[1830.98 → 1832.62] even going back
[1832.62 → 1834.30] to when those minutes
[1834.30 → 1835.50] were still made
[1835.50 → 1836.12] recorded
[1836.12 → 1838.62] and recorded
[1838.62 → 1839.96] in the Dutch language.
[1841.80 → 1842.54] And yes,
[1843.24 → 1844.06] other documents
[1844.06 → 1845.26] contain many mentions
[1845.26 → 1847.54] of the Crohn family involvement
[1847.54 → 1848.38] in church
[1848.38 → 1849.88] and Christian school ministries
[1849.88 → 1851.58] and administration.
[1851.58 → 1854.78] Some of my fondest memories
[1854.78 → 1855.92] of meetings with Jerry
[1855.92 → 1857.82] were at his shop
[1857.82 → 1860.62] or when he was
[1860.62 → 1861.84] nearing even
[1861.84 → 1863.80] or at 90 years old
[1863.80 → 1865.40] right here in this church
[1865.40 → 1866.92] where he was still
[1866.92 → 1868.14] helping Wayne and Jeanette
[1868.14 → 1869.94] with some janitorial duties here.
[1871.28 → 1872.38] Some of our short
[1872.38 → 1874.84] and some of our not-so-short
[1874.84 → 1877.50] meets were always special.
[1879.52 → 1880.12] Jerry and Anna
[1880.12 → 1881.36] were some of the oldest
[1881.36 → 1883.14] members of our congregation here.
[1884.34 → 1885.16] Jerry was always
[1885.16 → 1885.88] very proud
[1885.88 → 1886.66] in saying
[1886.66 → 1888.02] he felt like
[1888.02 → 1890.12] I can live to be 100.
[1891.20 → 1892.86] And until the last few years
[1892.86 → 1894.52] he said that
[1894.52 → 1895.92] and I'm not taking
[1895.92 → 1896.80] any medications
[1896.80 → 1898.90] which may or may not
[1898.90 → 1899.30] have been
[1899.30 → 1900.90] completely accurate.
[1902.60 → 1903.62] Jerry even
[1903.62 → 1906.00] at his 99th birthday
[1906.00 → 1907.82] felt that he would
[1907.82 → 1909.84] probably be 100.
[1911.36 → 1913.34] then he pondered
[1913.34 → 1914.78] will I then be
[1914.78 → 1915.28] the oldest
[1915.28 → 1916.28] in the church
[1916.28 → 1918.62] or
[1918.62 → 1920.26] would his dear friend
[1920.26 → 1921.70] just a few months older
[1921.70 → 1922.50] outlive him.
[1923.62 → 1924.02] Yes
[1924.02 → 1924.64] Jerry
[1924.64 → 1926.34] Ted has outlived you
[1926.34 → 1927.24] but wow
[1927.24 → 1929.86] 99 plus years
[1929.86 → 1930.88] what a gift.
[1933.44 → 1934.14] Betty and Ann
[1934.14 → 1936.56] Don
[1936.56 → 1936.58] Don
[1936.58 → 1938.86] your children
[1938.86 → 1940.92] Wayne and
[1940.92 → 1941.30] Janette
[1941.30 → 1943.06] and your children
[1943.06 → 1944.52] and yes
[1944.52 → 1945.30] their beloved
[1945.30 → 1945.84] youngest
[1945.84 → 1946.92] Peter and Nick
[1946.92 → 1948.44] who gave them
[1948.44 → 1949.50] maybe some heartaches
[1949.50 → 1950.22] but also
[1950.22 → 1951.32] so many joys
[1951.32 → 1953.24] you all
[1953.24 → 1954.90] were so much
[1954.90 → 1955.78] a centre
[1955.78 → 1957.22] of your parents
[1957.22 → 1957.66] and
[1957.66 → 1958.76] and
[1958.76 → 1959.58] your parents
[1959.58 → 1960.04] lives
[1960.04 → 1961.44] and that
[1961.44 → 1962.12] never
[1962.12 → 1962.92] wavered.
[1964.20 → 1964.84] Even
[1964.84 → 1965.54] in her
[1965.54 → 1966.16] diseased
[1966.16 → 1967.72] mind
[1967.72 → 1969.58] your mother
[1969.58 → 1970.80] still spoke of you
[1970.80 → 1972.26] so lovingly.
[1973.22 → 1973.78] Your father
[1973.78 → 1974.76] up until two weeks
[1974.76 → 1975.90] before his passing
[1975.90 → 1977.16] still
[1977.16 → 1978.36] longed to see you
[1978.36 → 1978.82] Betty Ann
[1978.82 → 1980.62] and have you
[1980.62 → 1980.94] Wayne
[1980.94 → 1981.60] visit
[1981.60 → 1983.42] and sit with him
[1983.42 → 1984.52] which happened
[1984.52 → 1985.14] frequently.
[1985.14 → 1987.18] for the last
[1987.18 → 1987.82] number of years
[1987.82 → 1988.34] at the end
[1988.34 → 1988.80] of a visit
[1988.80 → 1989.36] with Jerry
[1989.36 → 1989.96] and Ann
[1989.96 → 1991.64] the last
[1991.64 → 1992.84] year or so
[1992.84 → 1993.30] with Jerry
[1993.30 → 1993.82] alone
[1993.82 → 1996.04] I would always
[1996.04 → 1997.06] end our visit
[1997.06 → 1997.50] with
[1997.50 → 1998.58] toxins
[1998.58 → 2000.44] in English
[2000.44 → 2001.38] till we see
[2001.38 → 2002.20] each other again
[2002.20 → 2004.18] and they would
[2004.18 → 2004.72] respond
[2004.72 → 2005.38] in kind.
[2006.50 → 2006.92] They then
[2006.92 → 2007.94] always reminded me
[2007.94 → 2008.42] to say
[2008.42 → 2009.50] hi to my wife
[2009.50 → 2009.84] Shirley
[2009.84 → 2011.26] and each
[2011.26 → 2012.06] and every time
[2012.06 → 2013.16] they reminded me
[2013.16 → 2013.72] Ann
[2013.72 → 2014.52] your family
[2014.52 → 2017.92] late in the last
[2017.92 → 2019.10] evening of Jerry's
[2019.10 → 2020.00] life I was able
[2020.00 → 2020.90] to visit with him
[2020.90 → 2021.72] and the family.
[2023.16 → 2024.00] I read
[2024.00 → 2024.52] with him
[2024.52 → 2025.48] I prayed
[2025.48 → 2026.00] with Jerry
[2026.00 → 2027.30] and
[2027.30 → 2028.40] then said
[2028.40 → 2029.10] my goodbye
[2029.10 → 2030.08] toxins
[2030.08 → 2031.14] in the
[2031.14 → 2031.52] hammer
[2031.52 → 2032.74] in heaven.
[2034.10 → 2034.28] Jerry
[2034.28 → 2035.20] acknowledged this
[2035.20 → 2036.42] with a very
[2036.42 → 2037.34] light squeeze
[2037.34 → 2038.02] of my hand
[2038.02 → 2039.30] and a very
[2039.30 → 2040.18] soft whisper
[2040.18 → 2040.58] yeah.
[2040.58 → 2042.90] today I feel
[2042.90 → 2043.60] most privileged
[2043.60 → 2044.18] to be asked
[2044.18 → 2044.74] to remember
[2044.74 → 2045.38] and honour
[2045.38 → 2047.16] a wonderful
[2047.16 → 2048.02] couple in their
[2048.02 → 2048.46] family
[2048.46 → 2049.90] in this truly
[2049.90 → 2050.82] blessed
[2050.82 → 2052.14] celebration
[2052.14 → 2053.28] of life.
[2054.12 → 2055.08] We remember
[2055.08 → 2055.68] with joy
[2055.68 → 2057.86] the very long
[2057.86 → 2058.48] and blessed
[2058.48 → 2059.00] lives
[2059.00 → 2060.02] that their
[2060.02 → 2061.04] Lord gave
[2061.04 → 2061.34] them
[2061.34 → 2062.64] and that they
[2062.64 → 2063.06] can now
[2063.06 → 2063.82] enjoy living
[2063.82 → 2064.26] with their
[2064.26 → 2065.22] Saviour in heaven
[2065.22 → 2066.90] to eternity.
[2066.90 → 2071.02] great
[2072.74 → 2073.72] A
[2073.72 → 2076.30] thousand
[2076.30 → 2076.52] letter
[2076.60 → 2077.30] other
[2077.30 → 2078.00] words
[2078.00 → 2079.26] and
[2079.36 → 2079.82] other
[2079.82 → 2080.18] things
[2080.18 → 2080.92] that
[2080.92 → 2081.00] told me
[2081.00 → 2082.92] you're
[2082.92 → 2085.00] what you're
[2085.42 → 2085.50] making and
[2085.50 → 2086.30] helping them
[2086.30 → 2087.68] develop us
[2087.68 → 2093.90] Great Aunt Marie and set at 103
[2093.90 → 2099.52] Write scripture on your heart for when you need it
[2099.52 → 2106.22] Cause anxiety hates Psalm 23
[2106.22 → 2111.70] So just say it to yourself till you believe it
[2111.70 → 2117.88] And I'm feeling like I'm needing it right now
[2117.88 → 2125.26] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
[2125.26 → 2131.28] He leads me by still waters till my fears are gone
[2131.28 → 2137.60] Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[2137.60 → 2143.90] Though I know you are with me, my Father, my friend
[2143.90 → 2152.32] Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days
[2152.32 → 2158.16] I know by your still waters I'm safe
[2158.16 → 2164.60] Lord, I believe you can set me at ease
[2164.60 → 2169.82] Turn this broken piece in me to peace and quiet
[2169.82 → 2177.76] I know there's power in your word
[2177.76 → 2182.82] So I'll say it over and over till my soul's reminded
[2182.82 → 2189.82] Oh, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
[2189.82 → 2195.82] He leads me by still waters till my fears are gone
[2195.82 → 2202.18] Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[2202.18 → 2207.82] Though I know you are with me, my Father, my friend
[2207.82 → 2216.98] Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days
[2216.98 → 2222.82] I know by your still waters I'm safe
[2222.82 → 2230.82] Still waters run through any valley I could find
[2230.82 → 2237.82] I'm laying fear down here in heaven's riverside
[2237.82 → 2243.82] Your word has been true in every season of my life
[2243.82 → 2244.82] I believe, yes, I believe
[2244.82 → 2248.82] I believe, yes, I believe
[2248.82 → 2254.82] Still waters run through any valley I could find
[2254.82 → 2258.82] I'm laying fear down here in heaven's riverside
[2258.82 → 2260.82] Your word has been true in every season of my life
[2260.82 → 2261.82] I believe, yes, I believe
[2261.82 → 2267.82] I believe, yes, I believe
[2267.82 → 2275.82] Oh, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
[2275.82 → 2281.82] He leads me by still waters till my fears are gone
[2281.82 → 2290.82] Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[2290.82 → 2296.82] Though I know you are with me, my Father, my friend
[2296.82 → 2302.82] Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days
[2302.82 → 2312.82] I know by your still waters I am safe
[2332.82 → 2354.82] I can only imagine What it will be like When I walk by your side
[2354.82 → 2366.82] I can only imagine What my eyes will see When your face is before me
[2366.82 → 2379.82] I can only imagine Yeah
[2379.82 → 2385.82] Surrounded by your glory What will my heart feel
[2385.82 → 2391.82] Will I dance for you, Jesus Or in awe of you be still
[2391.82 → 2397.82] Will I stand in your presence Or to my knees will I fall
[2397.82 → 2402.82] Will I sing hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all
[2402.82 → 2405.82] I can only imagine
[2405.82 → 2426.82] I can only imagine When that day comes And I find myself standing in the sun
[2426.82 → 2433.82] I can only imagine When all I would do Is forever
[2433.82 → 2440.82] Forever worship you can only imagine
[2440.82 → 2445.82] Yeah I can only imagine
[2445.82 → 2447.82] I can only imagine
[2456.82 → 2457.82] Sing
[2457.82 → 2460.82] Yet not I
[2460.82 → 2461.82] But through Christ in me
[2461.82 → 2469.82] motherfucker
[2469.82 → 2479.28] What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer?
[2479.28 → 2487.12] There is no more for heaven now to give.
[2487.92 → 2494.68] He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[2494.68 → 2502.58] My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[2502.58 → 2509.24] To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[2510.76 → 2516.76] For my life is wholly bound to His.
[2516.76 → 2524.08] Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[2524.14 → 2532.22] All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2532.22 → 2543.32] The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[2544.32 → 2550.60] For by my side, the Saviour, He will stay.
[2550.60 → 2558.50] I labour on in weakness and rejoicing.
[2559.06 → 2565.16] For when I need, His power is displayed.
[2566.66 → 2573.50] To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[2573.50 → 2581.32] Through the deepest valley, He will be.
[2581.76 → 2588.98] Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[2589.90 → 2595.96] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2595.96 → 2607.08] No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[2607.08 → 2615.48] The future's sure, the price it has been paid.
[2615.48 → 2622.30] For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[2622.30 → 2630.48] And He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[2630.48 → 2637.12] To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[2638.58 → 2644.18] Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[2646.24 → 2649.66] Oh, the chains are released.
[2649.66 → 2653.42] I can sing, I am free.
[2653.42 → 2660.22] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2664.22 → 2671.44] With every breath, I long to follow Jesus.
[2671.44 → 2679.00] For He has said that He will bring me home.
[2679.00 → 2686.92] And day by day, I know He will renew me.
[2687.46 → 2693.70] Until I stand with joy before the throne.
[2693.70 → 2701.70] To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[2701.70 → 2708.96] Oh, the glory evermore to Him.
[2709.96 → 2717.70] When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[2717.70 → 2724.08] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2724.08 → 2733.58] When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[2733.58 → 2741.08] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2741.08 → 2750.64] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[2750.64 → 2768.74] So Wayne, Betty Ann, Joe, thank you for those remembrances, the stories
[2768.74 → 2773.66] which honoured Jerry and Ann and also honoured our Lord.
[2773.66 → 2779.92] so I have the privilege of opening God's word with us briefly this afternoon
[2779.92 → 2788.76] and the text that was chosen for us today is Psalm 37 just one verse 5 and this was a
[2788.76 → 2793.86] very special verse to Jerry and Ann because it was the verse that was read at their wedding
[2793.86 → 2803.20] now I would have enjoyed hearing what was said by the pastor who married them but here's
[2803.20 → 2813.56] what it says commit your way to the Lord trust in him, and he will do this, and I can't read Dutch
[2813.56 → 2823.40] but that that is Dutch you know I guess of course the wedding would have been in Dutch and I can
[2823.40 → 2829.06] see why you know what having looked at this passage and considered it why Jerry and Ann
[2829.06 → 2834.44] chose it for they're the Bible verse for their wedding you know as they committed to following
[2834.44 → 2842.64] the Lord together in their marriage to commit their ways to the Lord to trust in him and look for God's
[2842.64 → 2850.24] blessing in their marriage but let me pray for us briefly as before we consider this verse
[2850.24 → 2858.68] further let's pray father in heaven what a privilege it is to be here this day to thank you for the lives
[2858.68 → 2867.32] of Jerry and Ann God would you bless us now as we open your word would your spirit be among us that we
[2867.32 → 2876.72] might know that Christ truly is our one and only hope in life and in death it's in his name that we pray
[2876.72 → 2888.78] amen and so this verse from Psalm 37 is a great comfort for us in the face of Jerry and Ann's death
[2888.78 → 2894.66] and that's the main thing that I want us to think about for a moment briefly this afternoon that this
[2894.66 → 2901.54] is a verse of comfort but in the end I also want to want us to think that it is also a challenge
[2901.54 → 2910.26] it's a challenge for us who continue in the midst of this life in this world, but first it's a comfort
[2910.26 → 2919.04] the psalmist encourages us commit your way to the Lord trust in him, and he will do this it's a great
[2919.04 → 2927.56] comfort because what it tells us is that the Lord is the one who is able to do all that we cannot do
[2927.56 → 2934.96] on our own in our own strength right there's so much that we want to do there's so much that we want
[2934.96 → 2943.30] to accomplish in this life whether it's to have a happy marriage to raise our kids well to have a
[2943.30 → 2953.98] successful job or just to honour God in our everyday lives and all of these things it is the Lord who will
[2953.98 → 2968.70] do this as we commit our ways to do all of us do all of these things what we need the Lord to do for us first and
[2968.70 → 2979.18] foremost is to accomplish our salvation, and we see that as well in Psalm 37, and you see this is the gospel that
[2979.18 → 2985.38] Jerry and Ann believed and that they hoped him, and it's summed up for us in verse 39
[2985.38 → 2993.60] so further down in Psalm 37 verse 39 it says the salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord
[2993.60 → 3002.98] right when it comes to our salvation it is not something that we can do on our own
[3002.98 → 3015.14] or in our own strength, but it must come from the Lord we know this we know that our times are in God's
[3015.14 → 3017.88] hands the moment of our birth
[3017.88 → 3029.68] at the moment that we die even if it's at the age of 99 that God has left nothing to chance that God has
[3029.68 → 3035.32] ordered it he has not only appointed our life and our death though that, but he has also appointed
[3035.32 → 3044.24] our salvation he planned it he will bring to completion his purposes those whom God saves
[3044.24 → 3052.12] he has purposed to save from before the foundation of the world God has purposed the end from the very
[3052.12 → 3060.44] beginning and so God not only planned and purposed our salvation though he then fully accomplished it
[3060.44 → 3071.40] when Jesus died on the cross at Calvary he said it is finished our salvation was achieved for us
[3071.40 → 3077.72] and Jesus didn't just accomplish part of our salvation he accomplished the whole thing
[3077.72 → 3088.76] so all that we need for salvation we have in Jesus Christ and Paul says this in Colossians chapter
[3088.76 → 3094.68] 2 verse 10 in him, you have been made complete
[3094.68 → 3105.48] in him, you have been made complete right and so you and I friend we don't do or bring anything
[3105.48 → 3113.78] to contribute to that right that we are absolutely complete in Jesus Christ God has done it he has
[3113.78 → 3121.10] done it all he has provided our salvation in his son Jesus Christ and the thing is God had to do it all
[3121.10 → 3129.68] for us because you see our natural will is not to come to God our natural will is not to worship God
[3129.68 → 3138.02] and the fact is God is holy and righteous, and we are sinners and my natural will is to go in the opposite
[3138.02 → 3139.54] direction away from God
[3139.54 → 3150.10] that's what the Bible teaches and God had to stoop down to us, he had to lift us up out of the muck in
[3150.10 → 3158.28] the mire of our sin to set our feet upon the rock who is Jesus Christ, so God had to send a saviour to
[3158.28 → 3165.84] redeem us and to bring us home and our Lord said in John chapter 14 verse 3 if I go and prepare a place
[3165.84 → 3174.44] for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am
[3174.44 → 3181.04] right, so Jesus said if I go to prepare a place for you, I will take you to that place
[3181.04 → 3189.30] it's the place that God dwells it's called paradise and so friends the comfort that we have
[3189.30 → 3196.12] that God proclaims to us this day through his spirit through his word is that for those who
[3196.12 → 3204.88] trust in Christ there is the promise of eternal life commit your way to the Lord trust in him and he
[3204.88 → 3210.28] will do this the salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord
[3210.28 → 3218.68] and so for Jerry and Ann for all of us who die in the Lord what it means is that death is not the
[3218.68 → 3228.46] final story no death is not the end of the story their story continues and that is why there is real joy
[3228.46 → 3236.54] in the midst of our sorrow that there is real comfort because we know that our brother and sister are well
[3236.54 → 3244.74] right now they are well we know that we can be confident in that and so this verse is a tremendous
[3244.74 → 3252.14] comfort to us, I also though briefly want to challenge us this morning with this question
[3252.14 → 3261.58] in whom do you trust that's the question this passage asks in whom do you trust that was
[3261.58 → 3270.32] the challenge that Jerry and Ann heard I can only imagine at their wedding in your marriage in whom do you
[3270.32 → 3281.64] trust God will do it when we commit our ways to him, and we will experience much suffering and sorrow
[3281.64 → 3290.62] in this life but would it be that in the midst of the joys and the sorrows that you and I trust in the Lord
[3290.62 → 3300.52] who promises us that life does not end in death so let's not trust in ourselves let's not trust in other
[3300.52 → 3309.54] people or our stuff or our accomplishments all of these things will fade let us trust in the Lord let us
[3309.54 → 3317.92] commit our way to commit our way to him, and you can be secure in the hope of salvation because God will do it
[3317.92 → 3326.10] God will work it God will accomplish it and that's a great comfort to us and I want to just close and leave us
[3326.10 → 3337.52] with two more verses from Psalm 37 verses 23 and 24 and let's just consider these words the Lord makes firm
[3337.52 → 3345.70] the steps of the one who delights in him though he may stumble he will not fall for the Lord upholds him
[3345.70 → 3349.30] with his hand let's pray
[3349.30 → 3355.04] we thank you oh Lord that Jerry and Ann
[3355.04 → 3363.38] delighted in you that as sinners they couldn't save themselves and neither can we
[3363.38 → 3370.72] and Lord we often stumble and fall but Lord you promise to uphold us with your hands
[3370.72 → 3376.00] and so we trust in you, and we commit our whole lives even
[3376.00 → 3381.70] to the final moment of our final breath
[3381.70 → 3384.28] Lord we commit our whole lives into your hands
[3384.28 → 3387.24] we commit Jerry and Ann into your hands
[3387.24 → 3391.20] for the confidence and trust in who you are
[3391.20 → 3394.94] we pray in Jesus name and for his sake amen
[3394.94 → 3402.12] so let's rise, and we'll sing another hymn together because he lives
[3402.12 → 3415.74] God sent his son
[3415.74 → 3420.78] they called him Jesus
[3420.78 → 3426.38] he came to love
[3426.38 → 3429.00] heal and forgive
[3429.00 → 3431.00] heal and forgive
[3431.00 → 3435.88] he lived and died
[3435.88 → 3440.00] to bind my pardon
[3440.00 → 3446.32] an empty grave is there to prove
[3446.32 → 3450.20] my Saviour lives
[3450.20 → 3456.16] because he lives
[3456.16 → 3459.16] I can feel his tomorrow
[3459.16 → 3461.16] because he lives
[3461.16 → 3463.16] because he lives
[3463.16 → 3469.16] all fear is gone
[3469.16 → 3474.16] because I know
[3474.16 → 3477.16] he holds the future
[3477.16 → 3479.16] and life is good to live
[3479.16 → 3486.16] just because he lives
[3486.16 → 3490.16] just because he lives
[3490.16 → 3494.16] and then one day
[3494.16 → 3500.16] I'll cross the river
[3500.16 → 3503.16] I'll fight life's fine
[3503.16 → 3506.16] I'll fight life's fine
[3506.16 → 3510.16] a war with pain
[3510.16 → 3515.16] and then as death
[3515.16 → 3517.16] gives way to victory
[3517.16 → 3521.16] I'll see the heights of glory
[3521.16 → 3524.16] I'll see the heights of glory
[3524.16 → 3528.16] I'll know he lives
[3528.16 → 3532.16] because he lives
[3532.16 → 3538.16] I can face tomorrow
[3538.16 → 3542.16] because he lives
[3542.16 → 3549.16] all fear is gone
[3549.16 → 3553.16] because I know
[3553.16 → 3555.16] he holds the future
[3555.16 → 3558.16] he holds the future
[3558.16 → 3562.16] and life is good to live
[3562.16 → 3564.16] and life is good to live
[3564.16 → 3566.16] just because he lives
[3566.16 → 3567.16] because he lives
[3567.16 → 3577.16] because he lives
[3577.16 → 3601.56] can face tomorrow because he lives. All fear is gone because I know he holds the future
[3601.56 → 3612.12] and life is not living just because he lives.
[3619.12 → 3625.74] Please remain standing and would you join your hearts together as we pray.
[3625.74 → 3634.92] Oh God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we come to you with our grief but also with our thanksgiving.
[3635.80 → 3642.44] We thank you for the life of our dear brother and sister in Christ, Jerry and Anne Iron. We know
[3642.44 → 3647.86] that you created them, you blessed them in so many different ways throughout their lives,
[3648.42 → 3655.08] and you blessed all of us through them in different ways. We thank you for their faithful service to
[3655.08 → 3661.72] this congregation, for their friendship to many of us, and for joy-filled memories.
[3663.00 → 3670.76] And we thank you for their faithful Saviour, for you, Lord Jesus, who knew no sin but became sin,
[3671.14 → 3678.58] so that they and all of us who come to you might receive your righteousness. We thank you that even
[3678.58 → 3684.94] while their bodies have returned to dust, their spirits are being renewed in you and by you.
[3685.94 → 3692.38] And now we ask that you would renew us in our faith in the days and years to come as we continue to
[3692.38 → 3699.20] remember Jerry and Anne and to grieve their loss and to rejoice, Lord, in the hope of our salvation.
[3699.20 → 3707.60] Help us to fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen. Because the things that are seen are
[3707.60 → 3714.96] temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[3714.96 → 3715.04] Amen.
[3717.68 → 3725.30] And so we finish our time of worship, this time of remembrance, together with God's good word over us.
[3725.56 → 3729.46] It's called the benediction. I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture, if you're comfortable
[3729.46 → 3736.04] with that, to receive God's blessing. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine
[3736.04 → 3743.20] upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift his countenance upon you and give you peace. Amen.
[3743.20 → 3754.26] You may be seated. Thank you again for being with us today for the encouragement of your presence.
[3755.22 → 3760.80] And there is a reception immediately following our service through the doors there into the room
[3760.80 → 3765.82] directly, if you keep going, the fellowship hall. You'll find some refreshments, and it'll be a good
[3765.82 → 3772.88] time to greet the family. At this time, I want to invite Betty Ann to come up, and she will share
[3772.88 → 3775.78] some final words and some final instructions with us.
[3784.78 → 3792.42] So my parents were members of this church for over 65 years and the blessing that Jason just read
[3792.42 → 3800.04] was read to them at the end of every church service. And I know that that would be mom and dad's wish for us.
[3800.04 → 3807.22] So we have a musical version of that. And just consider this my mom and dad's special wish to all of you.
[3808.22 → 3808.86] Thank you.
[3808.86 → 3817.14] Thank you.
[3818.36 → 3819.88] So
[3819.88 → 3820.24] so
[3820.24 → 3847.44] The Lord bless you and keep you
[3847.44 → 3851.70] Make his face shine upon you
[3851.70 → 3854.68] Be gracious to you
[3854.68 → 3861.14] The Lord turn his face toward you
[3861.14 → 3866.58] And give me peace
[3866.58 → 3874.44] The Lord bless you
[3874.44 → 3878.10] And keep you
[3878.10 → 3882.60] Make his face shine upon you
[3882.60 → 3885.60] And be gracious to you
[3885.60 → 3892.44] The Lord turn his face toward you
[3892.44 → 3900.60] And give you peace
[3900.60 → 3906.26] Amen

[4031.14 → 4035.14] And your family and your children
[4035.14 → 4038.14] And their children and their children

[4079.64 → 4090.06] May His friends call before you, and beyond you, and beside you, and all around you, and within you.
[4090.06 → 4097.06] He is waiting, He is waiting for you, and within you.
[4097.06 → 4103.06] And you've got it, and you've died, and you're leaving, and rejoicing.
[4103.06 → 4122.06] He is for you, He is for you, He is for you, He is for you, He is for you.
[4122.06 → 4148.06] Amen
[4148.06 → 4151.72] May His favour be upon you
[4151.72 → 4156.80] And a thousand generations of your family
[4156.80 → 4161.72] And your children, and their children, and their children
[4161.72 → 4165.40] May His presence come before you
[4165.40 → 4168.88] And behind you, and besides you
[4168.88 → 4172.36] All around you, and within you
[4172.36 → 4175.76] He is with you, He is with you
[4175.76 → 4178.96] In the morning, in the evening
[4178.96 → 4182.40] And you're coming, and you're coming
[4182.40 → 4186.04] And you're weeping, and rejoicing
[4186.04 → 4189.76] He is for you, He is for you
[4189.76 → 4195.42] I can't explain
[4195.42 → 4198.04] What can be
