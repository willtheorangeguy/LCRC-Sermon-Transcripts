[313.28 --> 315.28]  Amen.
[315.28 --> 317.28]  Amen.
[317.28 --> 319.28]  Good morning.
[319.28 --> 320.28]  Good morning.
[320.28 --> 323.28]  Welcome to worship at Ladner Christian Reformed Church.
[323.28 --> 325.28]  My name is Jason Truel.
[325.28 --> 327.28]  I'm the lead pastor here.
[327.28 --> 329.28]  And I delight to welcome you this morning.
[329.28 --> 331.28]  I'm glad that you've come to join us for worship.
[331.28 --> 335.28]  Just a few announcements before we begin.
[335.28 --> 343.28]  So the first is our cross-training adult education class started this morning.
[343.28 --> 346.28]  The title is Redeeming Politics.
[346.28 --> 353.28]  And so that will be every Sunday at 9 o'clock in the Fellowship Hall over the next few weeks.
[353.28 --> 356.28]  And so everyone is invited to come out to that.
[356.28 --> 358.28]  Jeff, I hear an echo.
[358.28 --> 360.28]  I don't know if you can...
[360.28 --> 362.28]  Maybe it's just me.
[362.28 --> 364.28]  It's hot and possible.
[364.28 --> 370.28]  Another one is that the Bible reading bookmarks are available.
[370.28 --> 373.28]  We didn't put them into your bulletins this time.
[373.28 --> 378.28]  So if you do use it and you would like one, they are available on the foyer table.
[378.28 --> 383.28]  So if you'd like to follow along with daily Bible readings, then this is available for you as well.
[383.28 --> 389.28]  Another one that did not make it into the bulletin is that this coming Friday...
[389.28 --> 392.28]  And you may have seen the slide.
[392.28 --> 396.28]  But there is a prayer meeting, right?
[396.28 --> 398.28]  It's a prayer for Christian unity.
[398.28 --> 400.28]  You know, we've done this the last couple of years.
[400.28 --> 404.28]  It's hosted at Sacred Heart Parish here in Ladner.
[404.28 --> 406.28]  And so I believe it begins at 630.
[406.28 --> 413.28]  And so churches from the Delta area are all invited to come together and to pray.
[413.28 --> 416.28]  We pray for the youth in our city.
[416.28 --> 418.28]  We pray for our politicians.
[418.28 --> 420.28]  We pray for different things.
[420.28 --> 425.28]  And so it's really a wonderful time to come together and pray with people from different churches.
[425.28 --> 426.28]  It's quite wonderful.
[426.28 --> 428.28]  So I encourage you to come out to that.
[428.28 --> 431.28]  It's Friday night at 630 at Sacred Heart Parish.
[433.28 --> 435.28]  And so now we...
[435.28 --> 440.28]  And I haven't mentioned this yet, but we are in the season in the church calendar of Epiphany.
[441.28 --> 444.28]  And it's one of my favorite seasons.
[444.28 --> 449.28]  And it actually comes from the Greek word, which means to demonstrate or to show.
[449.28 --> 455.28]  And God has shown us who he is in Christ.
[455.28 --> 459.28]  And this is a wonderful truth that God has not hidden himself.
[459.28 --> 465.28]  He doesn't hide himself from us as if he's not interested in our lives.
[465.28 --> 470.28]  But God loves us so much that even while we were sinners, Christ came.
[470.28 --> 473.28]  He revealed God to us.
[473.28 --> 475.28]  He died for us.
[475.28 --> 480.28]  And he showed us who God is in the fullness of his love for us.
[480.28 --> 483.28]  And so God calls us to worship this morning.
[483.28 --> 489.28]  And we will read together these words from Psalm 147.
[489.28 --> 490.28]  We'll read this responsibly.
[490.28 --> 491.28]  I'll begin.
[491.28 --> 494.28]  And when it has the double arrow, I'll invite you to read along with me.
[494.28 --> 497.28]  Praise the Lord.
[497.28 --> 500.28]  How good it is to sing praises to our God.
[500.28 --> 503.28]  How pleasant and fitting to praise him.
[503.28 --> 509.28]  He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[509.28 --> 515.28]  He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.
[515.28 --> 518.28]  Sing to the Lord with grateful praise.
[518.28 --> 521.28]  Make music to our God on the harp.
[521.28 --> 528.28]  The Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.
[528.28 --> 532.28]  Let's pray together in a prayer of adoration.
[532.28 --> 542.28]  O Lord, our God, we praise you because you are the sovereign King of kings and Lord of lords.
[542.28 --> 548.28]  And you are also our heavenly Father who loves us as your children with an everlasting love.
[548.28 --> 561.28]  And Lord, in this season of epiphany, when we see you as the light, the light that has come into the world to shed your light abroad into all of the world.
[561.28 --> 564.28]  Lord, we praise you that you have not left us alone.
[564.28 --> 570.28]  You have not left us to wonder who you are, but you have come and you have revealed yourself.
[570.28 --> 582.28]  And so, Lord, would you be present now among us, guiding us, empowering us, binding us together in the Holy Spirit.
[582.28 --> 587.28]  Lord Jesus, our Redeemer, would you shine the light of your revelation upon us this morning,
[587.28 --> 592.28]  that we might see you in all of your goodness and your beauty and your truth.
[592.28 --> 598.28]  Holy Spirit, would you abide with us in this time of worship this morning.
[598.28 --> 601.28]  Would you draw us to yourself?
[601.28 --> 606.28]  Would you draw our hearts to know your love for us and for the whole world?
[606.28 --> 610.28]  We pray in the strong name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
[610.28 --> 615.28]  Friends, let's all stand as we hear God's greeting to us this morning.
[615.28 --> 619.28]  This comes to us from Jeremiah, chapter 23.
[619.28 --> 626.28]  In his days, Judah will be saved and Israel will dwell securely.
[626.28 --> 629.28]  And this is the name by which he will be called.
[629.28 --> 632.28]  The Lord is our righteousness.
[632.28 --> 636.28]  So, as God has greeted us, let's turn and let's greet one another.
[636.28 --> 641.28]  Thank you, Barbara?
[641.28 --> 643.28]  Thank you.
[644.28 --> 645.28]  Thank you.
[645.28 --> 647.28]  ...
[647.28 --> 651.28]  ...
[652.28 --> 659.76]  ...
[659.76 --> 689.74]  Thank you.
[689.76 --> 691.16]  You knew about Esther.
[691.54 --> 692.60]  So, all right.
[692.80 --> 693.68]  How great thou art.
[701.96 --> 709.46]  Oh, Lord my God, when I am lost among them,
[710.08 --> 715.82]  don't see the wrong, the wise that I have not been.
[715.82 --> 719.86]  I see the stars.
[720.20 --> 723.82]  I hear the lightning thunder.
[724.76 --> 729.82]  My cloud and wall, the universe is great.
[729.82 --> 731.82]  How great thou art.
[731.82 --> 737.82]  And sing my soul, my Savior God to thee.
[738.76 --> 740.82]  How great thou art.
[742.70 --> 744.82]  How great thou art.
[744.82 --> 751.82]  How great thou art.
[751.82 --> 755.82]  How great thou art.
[756.20 --> 760.82]  How great thou art.
[760.82 --> 762.82]  How great thou art.
[762.82 --> 763.82]  How great thou art.
[763.82 --> 765.82]  How great thou art.
[765.82 --> 776.78]  And forest birds are wandering, I hear their birds sing swiftly in the trees.
[776.78 --> 790.78]  And I look down from lofty mountain pasture, and hear their birds, and feel their gentle breeze.
[790.78 --> 798.74]  And sing my song, my Savior, not to me.
[798.74 --> 805.74]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[805.74 --> 821.70]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[821.70 --> 836.70]  And when I fear that God, His Son, not sparing, sent Him to die, I scarce could take it in.
[836.70 --> 844.66]  Now on the cross, my pardon, that we bury.
[844.66 --> 851.66]  He burdened God to take away my sin.
[851.66 --> 859.62]  And sing my song, my Savior, not to me.
[859.62 --> 867.58]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[867.58 --> 873.58]  And sing my song, my Savior, not to me.
[873.58 --> 883.58]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[883.58 --> 891.54]  One Christ shall come, with sound of acclamation.
[891.54 --> 898.54]  And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
[898.54 --> 906.50]  Then I shall bow, in humble adoration.
[906.50 --> 913.50]  And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art.
[913.50 --> 920.50]  And sing my song, my Savior, not to me.
[920.50 --> 928.46]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[928.46 --> 934.46]  And sing my song, my Savior, not to me.
[934.46 --> 945.46]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[945.46 --> 947.46]  Amen.
[947.46 --> 963.42]  Together.
[963.42 --> 979.38]  Salvation belongs to our God, who sits upon their throne.
[979.38 --> 983.34]  And unto the Lamb.
[983.34 --> 997.34]  Praise and glory, wisdom and bliss, honor and power and strength.
[997.34 --> 1016.30]  Be to our God, forever and ever.
[1016.30 --> 1025.26]  And we, the redeemed shall be strong.
[1025.26 --> 1032.26]  In purpose and unity.
[1032.26 --> 1042.22]  Declaring our love.
[1042.22 --> 1047.22]  Praise and glory, wisdom and faith.
[1047.22 --> 1057.18]  Wisdom and faith, honor and power and strength.
[1057.18 --> 1067.14]  Be to our God, forever and strength.
[1067.14 --> 1070.14]  Be to our God, forever and ever.
[1070.14 --> 1077.14]  Be to our God, forever and ever.
[1077.14 --> 1078.14]  Amen.
[1078.14 --> 1079.18]  Amen.
[1079.18 --> 1093.14]  Bye.
[1093.14 --> 1096.64]  Forever and ever
[1096.64 --> 1098.90]  Eternal
[1098.90 --> 1103.24]  Forever and ever
[1103.24 --> 1104.50]  Amen
[1104.50 --> 1106.50]  Amen
[1106.50 --> 1108.50]  Amen
[1108.50 --> 1110.50]  Amen
[1110.50 --> 1121.96]  Our first scripture reading
[1121.96 --> 1124.08]  for this morning is from Isaiah
[1124.08 --> 1125.52]  chapter 61
[1125.52 --> 1128.62]  So I invite you if you'd like to turn
[1128.62 --> 1130.04]  in your pew Bibles with me
[1130.04 --> 1131.66]  and we'll also have the words on the screen
[1131.66 --> 1132.98]  Isaiah
[1132.98 --> 1136.16]  chapter 61
[1136.16 --> 1140.66]  That is on page 558
[1140.66 --> 1141.60]  in your pew Bible
[1141.60 --> 1145.56]  Page 558
[1145.56 --> 1151.88]  And we will read the whole chapter
[1151.88 --> 1153.50]  Okay
[1153.50 --> 1155.70]  The spirit
[1155.70 --> 1158.00]  of the sovereign Lord is on me
[1158.00 --> 1159.90]  because the Lord
[1159.90 --> 1162.14]  has anointed me to preach
[1162.14 --> 1163.52]  good news to the poor
[1163.52 --> 1166.10]  He has sent me to bind up
[1166.10 --> 1166.96]  the brokenhearted
[1166.96 --> 1170.08]  to proclaim freedom for the captives
[1170.08 --> 1171.90]  and release from darkness
[1171.90 --> 1172.78]  for the prisoners
[1172.78 --> 1176.12]  to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor
[1176.12 --> 1177.86]  and the day of vengeance
[1177.86 --> 1179.02]  of our God
[1179.02 --> 1181.24]  to comfort all who mourn
[1181.24 --> 1183.18]  and to provide for those
[1183.18 --> 1184.32]  who grieve in Zion
[1184.32 --> 1185.88]  to bestow on them
[1185.88 --> 1186.88]  a crown of beauty
[1186.88 --> 1187.78]  instead of ashes
[1187.78 --> 1189.88]  the oil of gladness
[1189.88 --> 1190.84]  instead of mourning
[1190.84 --> 1193.02]  and a garment of praise
[1193.02 --> 1194.92]  instead of a spirit of despair
[1194.92 --> 1196.70]  They will be called
[1196.70 --> 1197.88]  oaks of righteousness
[1197.88 --> 1200.02]  a planting of the Lord
[1200.02 --> 1201.50]  for the display
[1201.50 --> 1202.80]  of his splendor
[1202.80 --> 1204.82]  They will rebuild
[1204.82 --> 1205.76]  the ancient ruins
[1205.76 --> 1207.00]  and restore the places
[1207.00 --> 1208.00]  long devastated
[1208.00 --> 1209.62]  They will renew
[1209.62 --> 1210.86]  the ruined cities
[1210.86 --> 1212.24]  that have been devastated
[1212.24 --> 1213.16]  for generations
[1213.16 --> 1215.16]  aliens will shepherd
[1215.16 --> 1215.92]  their flocks
[1215.92 --> 1217.06]  your flocks
[1217.06 --> 1218.82]  foreigners will work
[1218.82 --> 1219.60]  your fields
[1219.60 --> 1220.34]  and vineyards
[1220.34 --> 1221.52]  and you will be called
[1221.52 --> 1222.58]  priests of the Lord
[1222.58 --> 1224.52]  You will be named
[1224.52 --> 1225.10]  ministers
[1225.10 --> 1226.24]  of our God
[1226.24 --> 1227.66]  You will feed
[1227.66 --> 1228.80]  on the wealth of nations
[1228.80 --> 1230.04]  and in their riches
[1230.04 --> 1230.90]  you will boast
[1230.90 --> 1232.90]  Instead of their shame
[1232.90 --> 1233.40]  my people
[1233.40 --> 1234.34]  will receive
[1234.34 --> 1235.24]  a double portion
[1235.24 --> 1237.44]  and instead of disgrace
[1237.44 --> 1238.38]  they will rejoice
[1238.38 --> 1239.54]  in their inheritance
[1239.54 --> 1241.62]  and so they will inherit
[1241.62 --> 1242.52]  a double portion
[1242.52 --> 1243.28]  in their land
[1243.28 --> 1245.18]  and everlasting joy
[1245.18 --> 1246.14]  will be theirs
[1246.14 --> 1248.00]  For I the Lord
[1248.00 --> 1248.98]  love justice
[1248.98 --> 1249.96]  I hate robbery
[1249.96 --> 1251.20]  and iniquity
[1251.20 --> 1252.98]  In my faithfulness
[1252.98 --> 1254.10]  I will reward them
[1254.10 --> 1254.58]  and make
[1254.58 --> 1256.06]  an everlasting covenant
[1256.06 --> 1256.62]  with them
[1256.62 --> 1257.88]  Their descendants
[1257.88 --> 1258.64]  will be known
[1258.64 --> 1259.68]  among the nations
[1259.68 --> 1260.58]  their offspring
[1260.58 --> 1261.62]  among the peoples
[1261.62 --> 1263.60]  All who see them
[1263.60 --> 1264.34]  will acknowledge
[1264.34 --> 1265.70]  that they are a people
[1265.70 --> 1267.12]  the Lord has blessed
[1267.12 --> 1269.32]  I delight greatly
[1269.32 --> 1269.98]  in the Lord
[1269.98 --> 1271.14]  My soul rejoices
[1271.14 --> 1271.96]  in my God
[1271.96 --> 1273.88]  For he has clothed me
[1273.88 --> 1274.62]  with garments
[1274.62 --> 1275.30]  of salvation
[1275.30 --> 1276.64]  and arrayed me
[1276.64 --> 1277.30]  in a robe
[1277.30 --> 1277.92]  of righteousness
[1277.92 --> 1279.54]  As a bridegroom
[1279.54 --> 1280.52]  adorns his head
[1280.52 --> 1281.44]  like a priest
[1281.44 --> 1282.10]  and as a bride
[1282.10 --> 1283.04]  adorns herself
[1283.04 --> 1284.28]  with her jewels
[1284.28 --> 1286.12]  For as the soil
[1286.12 --> 1286.76]  makes a sprout
[1286.76 --> 1287.28]  come up
[1287.28 --> 1287.80]  and a garden
[1287.80 --> 1288.60]  causes seeds
[1288.60 --> 1289.08]  to grow
[1289.08 --> 1290.84]  So the sovereign Lord
[1290.84 --> 1291.72]  will make righteousness
[1291.72 --> 1292.58]  and praise
[1292.58 --> 1293.76]  spring up
[1293.76 --> 1295.30]  before all nations
[1295.30 --> 1296.66]  This is the word
[1296.66 --> 1297.06]  of the Lord
[1297.06 --> 1301.94]  So we come now
[1301.94 --> 1302.58]  to a time
[1302.58 --> 1303.78]  of confession
[1303.78 --> 1305.20]  and a remembrance
[1305.20 --> 1306.48]  also of God's grace
[1306.48 --> 1307.06]  for us
[1307.06 --> 1308.90]  The dominant image
[1308.90 --> 1310.58]  as I mentioned earlier
[1310.58 --> 1311.88]  in the season
[1311.88 --> 1312.52]  of Epiphany
[1312.52 --> 1313.50]  is light
[1313.50 --> 1315.50]  and God has shed
[1315.50 --> 1316.44]  his light abroad
[1316.44 --> 1317.40]  in the world
[1317.40 --> 1318.94]  and it is the light
[1318.94 --> 1319.72]  of his goodness
[1319.72 --> 1320.84]  and of his glory
[1320.84 --> 1322.76]  and of his grace
[1322.76 --> 1325.30]  But this light
[1325.30 --> 1327.40]  also reveals in us
[1327.40 --> 1329.24]  sins that we
[1329.24 --> 1330.16]  didn't even know
[1330.16 --> 1330.62]  were there
[1330.62 --> 1333.20]  and if we look well
[1333.20 --> 1334.44]  and if we look carefully
[1334.44 --> 1336.06]  if we're guided
[1336.06 --> 1337.24]  by the Holy Spirit
[1337.24 --> 1338.18]  we will see
[1338.18 --> 1339.60]  how we have
[1339.60 --> 1340.72]  broken his laws
[1340.72 --> 1342.36]  and how we have
[1342.36 --> 1343.92]  broken his heart
[1343.92 --> 1346.24]  And so in this time
[1346.24 --> 1347.24]  we come before the Lord
[1347.24 --> 1348.48]  to confess our sins
[1348.48 --> 1348.94]  together
[1348.94 --> 1351.10]  followed by a time
[1351.10 --> 1351.90]  of silent prayer
[1351.90 --> 1353.48]  And I will be using
[1353.48 --> 1353.98]  a prayer
[1353.98 --> 1356.12]  from a prayer book
[1356.12 --> 1356.58]  called
[1356.58 --> 1357.72]  The Valley of Vision
[1357.72 --> 1359.14]  So please
[1359.14 --> 1359.98]  join me
[1359.98 --> 1360.98]  in your hearts
[1360.98 --> 1362.04]  as I lead us
[1362.04 --> 1362.58]  in this prayer
[1362.58 --> 1363.10]  of confession
[1363.10 --> 1367.14]  Almighty
[1367.14 --> 1368.74]  everlasting God
[1368.74 --> 1369.22]  and Father
[1369.22 --> 1370.98]  We acknowledge
[1370.98 --> 1371.90]  and confess
[1371.90 --> 1373.58]  that we were
[1373.58 --> 1374.06]  conceived
[1374.06 --> 1375.44]  and born in sin
[1375.44 --> 1377.28]  and therefore
[1377.28 --> 1378.10]  inclined
[1378.10 --> 1379.06]  to all evil
[1379.06 --> 1380.60]  and slow
[1380.60 --> 1381.70]  to all good
[1381.70 --> 1383.98]  That we transgress
[1383.98 --> 1385.12]  your holy commandments
[1385.12 --> 1386.06]  without ceasing
[1386.06 --> 1387.92]  and corrupt ourselves
[1387.92 --> 1388.80]  more and more
[1388.80 --> 1390.78]  But we are sorry
[1390.78 --> 1391.50]  for this
[1391.50 --> 1392.84]  and desire
[1392.84 --> 1393.68]  your grace
[1393.68 --> 1394.30]  and help
[1394.30 --> 1395.92]  Therefore
[1395.92 --> 1397.36]  have mercy upon us
[1397.36 --> 1398.56]  most gracious
[1398.56 --> 1399.44]  and merciful
[1399.44 --> 1400.30]  God and Father
[1400.30 --> 1401.68]  through your Son
[1401.68 --> 1402.36]  our Lord
[1402.36 --> 1403.22]  Jesus Christ
[1403.22 --> 1405.14]  Grant to us
[1405.14 --> 1406.36]  and increase in us
[1406.36 --> 1407.26]  your Holy Spirit
[1407.26 --> 1409.26]  so that we may
[1409.26 --> 1409.74]  recognize
[1409.74 --> 1410.72]  our sin
[1410.72 --> 1411.82]  and unrighteousness
[1411.82 --> 1412.52]  from the depths
[1412.52 --> 1414.02]  of our hearts
[1414.02 --> 1415.72]  so that we will
[1415.72 --> 1417.12]  feel true repentance
[1417.12 --> 1417.92]  and grief
[1417.92 --> 1419.04]  for our sins
[1419.04 --> 1420.62]  and that we would
[1420.62 --> 1421.32]  die to them
[1421.32 --> 1421.90]  completely
[1421.90 --> 1423.08]  and please
[1423.08 --> 1423.98]  you wholly
[1423.98 --> 1425.18]  in a new
[1425.18 --> 1426.14]  and godly life
[1426.14 --> 1427.48]  Amen
[1427.48 --> 1430.34]  So let's silently
[1430.34 --> 1431.26]  confess our sins
[1431.26 --> 1431.84]  before the Lord
[1431.84 --> 1432.80]  I'll give you a time
[1432.80 --> 1433.80]  of silent confession
[1433.80 --> 1454.44]  and let's hear now
[1454.44 --> 1455.40]  the words of assurance
[1455.40 --> 1457.04]  that God has given us
[1457.04 --> 1460.30]  these are his words
[1460.30 --> 1460.70]  to us
[1460.70 --> 1461.46]  of his grace
[1461.46 --> 1462.38]  for all
[1462.38 --> 1463.66]  those who truly
[1463.66 --> 1464.34]  repent
[1464.34 --> 1465.44]  and turn to him
[1465.44 --> 1466.90]  seeking his forgiveness
[1466.90 --> 1467.46]  and so
[1467.46 --> 1468.00]  it comes from
[1468.00 --> 1468.70]  Psalm 32
[1468.70 --> 1470.06]  and I'll begin
[1470.06 --> 1471.82]  blessed is the one
[1471.82 --> 1471.84]  blessed is the one
[1471.84 --> 1472.74]  whose transgressions
[1472.74 --> 1473.28]  are forgiven
[1473.28 --> 1474.04]  whose sins
[1474.04 --> 1474.72]  are covered
[1474.72 --> 1476.42]  blessed is the one
[1476.42 --> 1476.92]  whose sin
[1476.92 --> 1477.30]  the Lord
[1477.30 --> 1478.16]  does not count
[1478.16 --> 1478.82]  against them
[1478.82 --> 1480.42]  and in whose spirit
[1480.42 --> 1481.68]  is no deceit
[1481.68 --> 1483.66]  I said
[1483.66 --> 1484.90]  I will confess
[1484.90 --> 1486.02]  my transgressions
[1486.02 --> 1486.84]  to the Lord
[1486.84 --> 1488.60]  and you forgave
[1488.60 --> 1489.28]  the guilt
[1489.28 --> 1490.58]  of my sin
[1490.58 --> 1493.68]  So friends
[1493.68 --> 1495.38]  God's pardoning
[1495.38 --> 1495.94]  voice
[1495.94 --> 1497.20]  has spoken
[1497.20 --> 1499.32]  and we are forgiven
[1499.32 --> 1501.04]  Jesus Christ
[1501.04 --> 1501.94]  sits at the right
[1501.94 --> 1502.46]  hand
[1502.46 --> 1503.50]  of the Father
[1503.50 --> 1504.40]  interceding
[1504.40 --> 1505.06]  for us
[1505.06 --> 1505.72]  always
[1505.72 --> 1507.02]  and even now
[1507.02 --> 1508.60]  and so in response
[1508.60 --> 1509.40]  to this truth
[1509.40 --> 1510.36]  let's stand
[1510.36 --> 1511.66]  and let's sing
[1511.66 --> 1512.78]  of God's grace
[1512.78 --> 1513.40]  to us
[1513.40 --> 1541.00]  to the river
[1541.00 --> 1544.74]  I am holy
[1544.74 --> 1547.86]  bringing sins
[1547.86 --> 1550.38]  that I cannot bear
[1550.38 --> 1555.50]  come and cleanse me
[1555.50 --> 1559.14]  come forgive me
[1559.14 --> 1561.62]  Lord I need
[1561.62 --> 1564.92]  to meet you there
[1564.92 --> 1568.64]  in this water
[1568.64 --> 1572.22]  healing mercy
[1572.22 --> 1575.50]  rose with freedom
[1575.50 --> 1578.70]  from this path
[1578.70 --> 1582.30]  I am going
[1582.30 --> 1586.14]  to the river
[1586.14 --> 1589.08]  Lord I need
[1589.08 --> 1592.28]  to meet you there
[1592.28 --> 1595.86]  Precious Jesus
[1595.86 --> 1599.14]  I am ready
[1599.14 --> 1602.42]  to surrender
[1602.42 --> 1605.22]  every care
[1605.22 --> 1609.12]  take my hand
[1609.12 --> 1609.98]  now
[1609.98 --> 1612.72]  heal me closer
[1612.72 --> 1615.72]  Lord I need
[1615.72 --> 1618.72]  to meet you there
[1618.72 --> 1625.98]  to the river
[1625.98 --> 1629.58]  I am holy
[1629.58 --> 1632.58]  bringing sins
[1632.58 --> 1636.16]  I cannot bear
[1636.16 --> 1639.98]  come and cleanse me
[1639.98 --> 1643.48]  come forgive me
[1643.48 --> 1645.86]  Lord I need
[1645.86 --> 1648.86]  to meet you there
[1648.86 --> 1652.72]  in this water
[1652.72 --> 1655.86]  healing mercy
[1655.86 --> 1658.86]  rose with freedom
[1658.86 --> 1660.86]  from despair
[1660.86 --> 1665.90]  I am going
[1665.90 --> 1668.86]  to the river
[1668.86 --> 1671.86]  Lord I need
[1671.86 --> 1675.86]  to meet you there
[1675.86 --> 1676.86]  Lord I need
[1676.86 --> 1677.86]  to meet you there
[1677.86 --> 1678.86]  Precious Jesus
[1678.86 --> 1682.86]  I am ready
[1682.86 --> 1684.86]  to surrender
[1684.86 --> 1685.86]  and repair
[1685.86 --> 1691.86]  take my hand
[1691.86 --> 1692.86]  to the river
[1692.86 --> 1694.86]  lead me closer
[1694.86 --> 1698.86]  Lord I need
[1698.86 --> 1699.86]  to meet you there
[1699.86 --> 1700.86]  Lord I need
[1700.86 --> 1701.86]  to meet you there
[1701.86 --> 1705.86]  come to join us
[1705.86 --> 1708.86]  in the river
[1708.86 --> 1710.86]  come to life
[1710.86 --> 1712.86]  beyond compare
[1712.86 --> 1722.86]  He is calling
[1722.86 --> 1725.86]  He is waiting
[1725.86 --> 1728.86]  Jesus Lord
[1728.86 --> 1731.86]  to meet you there
[1731.86 --> 1735.86]  He is calling
[1735.86 --> 1737.86]  He is waiting
[1737.86 --> 1741.86]  Jesus Lord
[1741.86 --> 1744.86]  to meet you there
[1744.86 --> 1747.86]  Jesus Jesus
[1747.86 --> 1750.86]  I am ready
[1750.86 --> 1751.86]  Jesus Jesus
[1751.86 --> 1752.86]  I am ready
[1752.86 --> 1755.86]  to surrender
[1755.86 --> 1756.86]  every care
[1756.86 --> 1758.86]  take my hand
[1758.86 --> 1759.86]  now
[1759.86 --> 1761.86]  lead me closer
[1761.86 --> 1769.86]  Lord I need
[1769.86 --> 1771.86]  to meet you there
[1771.86 --> 1774.86]  take my hand
[1774.86 --> 1775.86]  now
[1775.86 --> 1777.86]  lead me
[1777.86 --> 1779.86]  closer
[1779.86 --> 1782.86]  Lord I need
[1782.86 --> 1784.86]  to meet you there
[1784.86 --> 1799.42]  You may be seated for our next song.
[1814.86 --> 1816.86]  Amen.
[1844.86 --> 1846.86]  Amen.
[1874.86 --> 1876.86]  Amen.
[1904.86 --> 1909.74]  Jesus, Jesus, Lord, you come.
[1916.74 --> 1924.72]  Jesus said, if I am lost, he will come to me.
[1925.18 --> 1932.88]  And he showed me on that cross, he will come to me.
[1932.88 --> 1941.22]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[1941.72 --> 1949.72]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus, strong and kind.
[1950.24 --> 1957.82]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he will keep us day and night.
[1957.82 --> 1966.46]  We can always run to Jesus, Jesus, strong and kind.
[1966.46 --> 1970.80]  Jesus, strong and kind.
[1970.80 --> 1978.00]  For the Lord is good and faithful, he should not be day and night.
[1980.08 --> 1983.28]  Although Jesus is a pagan configurable, he is a man of loss.
[1984.24 --> 1989.06]  He saw in Jesus' soul headesh had glad he had known as hell and be heard he Bil werde.
[1989.06 --> 2008.96]  Okay, so as the children and teachers and assistants are going to their Sunday school classes,
[2009.76 --> 2012.86]  we will hear God's word for us this morning.
[2013.18 --> 2016.56]  So we are continuing in our sermon series in the book of Romans,
[2016.56 --> 2026.58]  and we come to a passage today that Martin Luther said was the most central passage in all the Bible.
[2027.34 --> 2028.74]  That's a pretty bold statement.
[2029.56 --> 2035.70]  And so after we read it, we'll see if you think you agree with what he said.
[2035.70 --> 2040.58]  So let's turn in our Bibles to Romans chapter 3.
[2046.56 --> 2053.80]  That is on page 838 in your pew Bible.
[2055.58 --> 2061.28]  Romans chapter 3, and we will read today verses 21 through 26.
[2062.96 --> 2065.12]  Okay, Romans 3, 21 to 26.
[2065.12 --> 2076.04]  But now a righteousness from God, apart from the law, has been made known, to which the law and the prophets testify.
[2076.76 --> 2082.44]  This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ, who all who believe,
[2082.44 --> 2087.56]  there is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[2088.02 --> 2094.32]  and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
[2095.20 --> 2099.96]  God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement through faith in his blood.
[2100.78 --> 2103.44]  He did this to demonstrate his justice,
[2103.74 --> 2108.78]  because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[2108.78 --> 2114.12]  He did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time,
[2114.62 --> 2121.34]  so as to be just in the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
[2122.14 --> 2123.42]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2125.66 --> 2130.10]  So let's pray and ask for God's blessing upon the reading and the preaching of his word.
[2130.20 --> 2130.84]  Let's pray together.
[2131.38 --> 2135.60]  Father, as we come to your word in this time,
[2135.60 --> 2140.42]  we're coming to a passage that speaks to us of glories
[2140.42 --> 2143.90]  that apart from your Holy Spirit we could never appreciate.
[2144.94 --> 2147.68]  But with the power of your Spirit working in us,
[2147.76 --> 2149.00]  Lord, we love these words,
[2149.58 --> 2151.12]  and we treasure these words.
[2153.00 --> 2157.26]  So Lord, would you open our minds and our hearts this morning by your Spirit,
[2157.26 --> 2164.90]  so that we might see the beauty, the glory of the gift that you have given us,
[2165.50 --> 2169.60]  and that we might then in turn respond in praise and love for you.
[2170.20 --> 2174.34]  We pray this, Lord, in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[2174.62 --> 2174.96]  Amen.
[2176.22 --> 2180.84]  Well, this morning I get to do a little bit of show and tell.
[2180.84 --> 2186.70]  And what I brought here is a pepper grinder.
[2187.88 --> 2188.02]  Okay.
[2188.50 --> 2193.24]  So in our house, it is my job to make dinner, which I enjoy doing.
[2193.38 --> 2194.06]  I love cooking.
[2194.34 --> 2198.60]  And I've always used those, you know, little plastic pepper grinders
[2198.60 --> 2202.66]  that you buy at the grocery store that have the peppercorns inside of them.
[2203.14 --> 2207.34]  But the problem is that those things get clogged up really easily.
[2207.94 --> 2208.20]  Right.
[2208.20 --> 2211.60]  And sometimes they crack and they break and you have to buy a new one.
[2212.16 --> 2216.42]  But now my pepper problems are over
[2216.42 --> 2221.70]  because I have this wonderful pepper grinder that is made of wood
[2221.70 --> 2226.38]  and it has a metal grinder that makes a satisfying crunching sound,
[2226.96 --> 2228.44]  you know, when you grind the pepper.
[2229.16 --> 2235.04]  And it is made by a fancy French company that I don't know how to say.
[2235.04 --> 2245.48]  Now, the reason I love this pepper grinder is that it is a gift.
[2246.62 --> 2250.92]  My wife, Christy, got this for me this past Christmas.
[2251.78 --> 2257.42]  And so now every time I cook with it and use it, it reminds me of her.
[2257.42 --> 2261.22]  And that is one of the things about gifts, right?
[2261.32 --> 2263.60]  Gifts are all about relationship.
[2264.56 --> 2268.48]  You know, for some of us here, you don't really know someone loves you
[2268.48 --> 2272.12]  until that person gives you a gift.
[2272.68 --> 2274.60]  I don't know if you know the five love languages.
[2275.02 --> 2276.22]  It's an old, old book, right?
[2276.32 --> 2279.70]  But one of those love languages is the giving of gifts.
[2279.70 --> 2283.02]  And so for a lot of us, that's just one of the ways,
[2283.42 --> 2285.94]  one of the main ways that we feel loved.
[2287.06 --> 2292.08]  And so when I look at this and use this pepper grinder from Christy,
[2292.50 --> 2296.30]  it reminds me of her.
[2296.92 --> 2298.68]  It reminds me of her love for me.
[2298.80 --> 2302.34]  It reminds me of her thoughtfulness of me.
[2302.34 --> 2308.26]  And it becomes a symbol of something much bigger than itself.
[2309.82 --> 2313.62]  And the reason I'm saying all this is because Christianity at its heart
[2313.62 --> 2318.08]  is a relationship with a gift at its center.
[2319.66 --> 2325.42]  Christianity at its heart is a relationship with a gift at its center, right?
[2325.98 --> 2330.36]  Christianity is not primarily a moral system.
[2330.36 --> 2333.66]  It is not primarily a worldview.
[2334.58 --> 2336.98]  It is not primarily even a religion.
[2337.80 --> 2341.42]  Now, of course, Christianity includes all of those things.
[2341.52 --> 2342.94]  It has a morality.
[2343.28 --> 2344.32]  It has a worldview.
[2344.58 --> 2346.18]  It is a religion in a sense.
[2347.04 --> 2350.70]  But at a far deeper and more fundamental level,
[2351.60 --> 2354.52]  Christianity is a relationship built on a gift.
[2355.74 --> 2360.30]  And one thing that means is that the Christian life, right?
[2360.30 --> 2366.26]  The life that we all live, in loving God, in walking with Jesus,
[2367.06 --> 2370.70]  the way that our Christian lives is continually renewed,
[2371.50 --> 2375.64]  is by looking at and treasuring the gift that God has given us.
[2376.28 --> 2376.58]  Right?
[2376.64 --> 2379.42]  In the same way that when I go to cook dinner,
[2379.74 --> 2381.98]  maybe I don't want to cook dinner, maybe whatever,
[2381.98 --> 2384.52]  but when I use my pepper grinder,
[2384.52 --> 2386.94]  I'm reminded of my wife's love for me.
[2388.06 --> 2389.28]  In a small way.
[2389.68 --> 2389.80]  Okay?
[2390.52 --> 2394.96]  In a similar way, by looking at the gift that God has given us,
[2395.14 --> 2399.56]  we can be reminded and renewed in knowing God's love for us.
[2400.98 --> 2403.92]  And so this morning, we're going to look at this passage in Romans 3
[2403.92 --> 2407.74]  that's all about this gift that is at the center of Christianity,
[2407.94 --> 2410.22]  that's at the center of our relationship with God.
[2410.22 --> 2414.70]  In fact, the gift that establishes our relationship with God.
[2415.60 --> 2417.46]  And so this morning, I have two points for us.
[2418.06 --> 2421.34]  First, what is the gift that God gives?
[2421.74 --> 2425.62]  And then, secondly, what does it cost God to give it to us?
[2426.42 --> 2429.62]  And then we'll talk about some things that that would mean for us.
[2430.22 --> 2430.36]  Okay?
[2430.46 --> 2431.54]  So that's what we'll do.
[2431.64 --> 2436.74]  So first, what is the gift that establishes our relationship with God?
[2436.74 --> 2440.62]  And the gift is, it's a gift of righteousness.
[2441.46 --> 2441.58]  Okay?
[2441.60 --> 2442.60]  It's a gift of righteousness.
[2442.90 --> 2445.72]  So let's look at what Paul says here in verse 21.
[2447.50 --> 2448.10]  He says,
[2448.10 --> 2467.66]  So Paul is talking about this gift of righteousness.
[2467.66 --> 2472.32]  And this righteousness that he is speaking of here in verses 21 and 22
[2472.32 --> 2475.62]  is a righteousness that is for us.
[2476.90 --> 2478.46]  It's a gift for us.
[2478.50 --> 2481.10]  It's not a righteousness that is against us.
[2481.72 --> 2481.82]  Okay?
[2481.94 --> 2485.28]  It's not the righteousness of God that condemns sinners
[2485.28 --> 2487.10]  or that judges sinners,
[2487.10 --> 2491.84]  but it is actually a righteousness that is for us
[2491.84 --> 2496.12]  because it is given to us through faith in Jesus Christ.
[2497.06 --> 2501.80]  Now, Paul continues and he tells us really why this is so important.
[2502.32 --> 2504.44]  So continuing on in verse 22,
[2505.00 --> 2505.58]  he says,
[2505.72 --> 2508.34]  There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
[2508.48 --> 2511.20]  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[2511.20 --> 2514.44]  And really, that is just a summary of the last, you know,
[2514.60 --> 2517.34]  two chapters that we've been looking at over the many weeks.
[2517.34 --> 2522.44]  And this is, again, an absolute statement, right?
[2522.52 --> 2526.78]  For Jews and Gentiles, and that's everybody, right?
[2526.82 --> 2528.38]  For all people all over the world,
[2528.78 --> 2530.40]  we have all sinned.
[2531.02 --> 2533.20]  And as a result of our sin,
[2533.68 --> 2535.30]  we fall short of God's glory.
[2535.92 --> 2537.24]  Or another way of saying that
[2537.24 --> 2541.30]  is that we continually lack the glory of God.
[2542.72 --> 2544.76]  And friends, that is no small problem.
[2544.76 --> 2547.38]  There's no small problem at all.
[2547.60 --> 2551.50]  Because God requires righteousness from us.
[2552.56 --> 2553.48]  He requires it.
[2554.10 --> 2558.00]  The only proper response to God,
[2558.06 --> 2559.54]  who has made us in his image,
[2560.54 --> 2562.44]  is that we would reflect the glory
[2562.44 --> 2564.14]  and the righteousness of God in the world.
[2564.44 --> 2566.56]  To live in God's world in a way
[2566.56 --> 2568.42]  that displays his righteousness
[2568.42 --> 2570.58]  and his goodness and his holiness.
[2572.08 --> 2573.98]  But because of our sin,
[2574.76 --> 2576.46]  we do not reflect his glory.
[2576.64 --> 2578.92]  That image in us is broken
[2578.92 --> 2582.26]  and we are completely unable to do it.
[2582.30 --> 2584.12]  We can't keep the law.
[2585.18 --> 2587.10]  And so it is impossible for us
[2587.10 --> 2589.26]  to establish a relationship with God
[2589.26 --> 2593.30]  that will meet God's standards on our own.
[2594.54 --> 2596.52]  And that is why the gift of righteousness
[2596.52 --> 2598.74]  is good news for everyone.
[2598.74 --> 2601.76]  The gospel is the message that every person
[2601.76 --> 2603.78]  and every time and every place
[2603.78 --> 2608.28]  is for everyone and every time and every place
[2608.28 --> 2611.62]  because the fundamental human problem
[2611.62 --> 2613.00]  is that we are sinners
[2613.00 --> 2614.72]  and that we fall short of the glory of God.
[2615.96 --> 2618.96]  And so the gift that is the foundation
[2618.96 --> 2621.32]  of our relationship with God
[2621.32 --> 2624.52]  is God giving us a righteousness
[2624.52 --> 2625.92]  that we do not possess.
[2625.92 --> 2628.06]  It's his giving us a status
[2628.06 --> 2630.38]  and a standing before him
[2630.38 --> 2632.50]  in his sight of righteousness.
[2633.82 --> 2636.12]  And we saw that in Isaiah 61
[2636.12 --> 2636.98]  that we read earlier.
[2637.68 --> 2638.74]  It says this,
[2639.12 --> 2640.84]  I delight greatly in the Lord.
[2640.96 --> 2643.00]  My soul rejoices in my God.
[2643.34 --> 2643.66]  Why?
[2644.76 --> 2647.30]  For he has clothed me
[2647.30 --> 2648.46]  with garments of salvation
[2648.46 --> 2651.34]  and arrayed me in a robe
[2651.34 --> 2653.38]  of his righteousness.
[2653.38 --> 2655.40]  So we praise him.
[2656.48 --> 2659.46]  And so apart from the law
[2659.46 --> 2660.82]  that we cannot keep,
[2661.18 --> 2663.16]  God is covering us
[2663.16 --> 2663.96]  with his righteousness.
[2665.42 --> 2665.92]  Right?
[2666.00 --> 2666.90]  And it's not, again,
[2666.96 --> 2668.34]  a righteousness of our own,
[2668.84 --> 2670.32]  but he is covering us
[2670.32 --> 2672.02]  with a robe of his righteousness.
[2672.98 --> 2674.74]  Okay, so that was kind of briefly,
[2675.10 --> 2677.64]  what is the gift that God gives us?
[2677.64 --> 2681.60]  And this is an amazing gift, right?
[2681.64 --> 2682.84]  That he gives us his righteousness.
[2683.28 --> 2684.78]  And again, it's the foundation
[2684.78 --> 2686.80]  of the Christian's relationship with God.
[2687.48 --> 2689.28]  But that leads us to our second point,
[2689.36 --> 2690.28]  which will be a lot longer.
[2691.32 --> 2693.04]  What did the gift cost?
[2694.02 --> 2695.14]  What did the gift cost?
[2695.18 --> 2695.68]  Because, you know,
[2695.74 --> 2697.36]  when Christy gave me this pepper grinder
[2697.36 --> 2699.18]  and I opened it on Christmas Day,
[2699.98 --> 2701.26]  you know when you give a gift,
[2701.34 --> 2701.70]  what do you do?
[2702.22 --> 2703.82]  You take off the price tag, right?
[2703.88 --> 2704.74]  Hopefully unless you forget.
[2704.74 --> 2707.84]  So I don't know what this cost her,
[2708.38 --> 2709.08]  or us.
[2710.02 --> 2711.44]  I didn't check our bank statement.
[2712.92 --> 2715.72]  But in the following verses,
[2716.62 --> 2719.22]  Paul tells us what it cost God
[2719.22 --> 2722.06]  to give us this gift of his righteousness.
[2722.64 --> 2723.82]  And there are two ways
[2723.82 --> 2724.98]  that Paul talks about this
[2724.98 --> 2726.38]  in this passage,
[2726.48 --> 2727.22]  about the cost.
[2727.22 --> 2728.66]  He talks about redemption
[2728.66 --> 2730.86]  and he talks about atonement.
[2731.06 --> 2731.82]  Two different things.
[2732.42 --> 2734.66]  And these are two good biblical words
[2734.66 --> 2736.52]  that Paul uses in this passage.
[2737.12 --> 2738.08]  And so what I want to do
[2738.08 --> 2739.34]  is look at each in turn
[2739.34 --> 2741.62]  so we can know how valuable
[2741.62 --> 2742.92]  and how costly
[2742.92 --> 2745.98]  this gift of righteousness is.
[2746.74 --> 2747.88]  Okay, so the first thing
[2747.88 --> 2749.52]  that God offers us
[2749.52 --> 2751.30]  is redemption.
[2752.46 --> 2754.00]  Okay, so look with me at verse 24.
[2754.00 --> 2757.78]  And all are justified
[2757.78 --> 2760.06]  or you can say made righteous
[2760.06 --> 2762.60]  freely by his grace
[2762.60 --> 2763.84]  through the redemption
[2763.84 --> 2766.60]  that came by Christ Jesus.
[2767.46 --> 2769.76]  Okay, so let's look at this.
[2770.22 --> 2771.46]  That word redemption,
[2771.64 --> 2772.36]  that's the key word.
[2773.02 --> 2774.00]  And it's a word,
[2774.10 --> 2774.98]  as you know,
[2775.04 --> 2776.00]  you've probably heard before,
[2776.10 --> 2778.06]  that comes from the slave market.
[2778.70 --> 2780.20]  So in the ancient world, right,
[2780.20 --> 2781.46]  if you became a slave
[2781.46 --> 2783.50]  through some misfortune,
[2783.98 --> 2784.12]  you know,
[2784.18 --> 2786.32]  maybe your family was in debt
[2786.32 --> 2787.70]  and so your entire family
[2787.70 --> 2788.92]  was sold into slavery,
[2789.40 --> 2792.46]  or maybe you are a war captive
[2792.46 --> 2795.70]  and so you were taken into captivity.
[2796.84 --> 2798.16]  In either case,
[2798.20 --> 2799.88]  your life would now be owned
[2799.88 --> 2801.58]  entirely by somebody else
[2801.58 --> 2803.98]  who would have control over you.
[2804.50 --> 2805.58]  And the only way
[2805.58 --> 2807.76]  that you could secure your freedom,
[2807.76 --> 2808.68]  your release,
[2808.92 --> 2810.56]  is if a payment was made.
[2811.46 --> 2812.54]  There had to be a payment.
[2812.86 --> 2814.84]  And that's what the word redemption means.
[2814.92 --> 2815.72]  It means a payment
[2815.72 --> 2817.46]  for the freedom of a slave.
[2819.08 --> 2820.10]  So now,
[2820.28 --> 2821.68]  when Paul says
[2821.68 --> 2823.54]  that Jesus had to die
[2823.54 --> 2825.12]  to redeem us,
[2825.60 --> 2827.22]  what is he telling us?
[2827.98 --> 2829.26]  He is saying something
[2829.26 --> 2830.20]  very unflattering.
[2830.84 --> 2832.02]  He's telling us
[2832.02 --> 2833.80]  that we are slaves.
[2834.70 --> 2835.84]  We are slaves.
[2835.84 --> 2839.22]  We are captivated by sin.
[2839.22 --> 2841.82]  Now, some of us maybe
[2841.82 --> 2842.94]  are saying to ourselves,
[2843.64 --> 2845.90]  excuse me, right?
[2846.16 --> 2847.46]  I am not enslaved.
[2847.84 --> 2849.30]  I do not feel
[2849.30 --> 2851.84]  like I am captivated by sin.
[2852.78 --> 2854.06]  And that is, in fact,
[2854.14 --> 2855.02]  the very conversation
[2855.02 --> 2857.02]  that the Pharisees had with Jesus.
[2857.72 --> 2859.04]  The Pharisees insisted
[2859.04 --> 2860.70]  that they are not slaves to sin.
[2861.26 --> 2863.24]  And this is what Jesus says.
[2863.24 --> 2864.46]  He says,
[2864.46 --> 2866.62]  everyone who sins
[2866.62 --> 2868.80]  is a slave to sin.
[2869.62 --> 2870.84]  John 8, 34.
[2871.56 --> 2872.48]  Everyone who sins
[2872.48 --> 2873.30]  is a slave to sin.
[2873.82 --> 2875.66]  So we need to be redeemed
[2875.66 --> 2876.20]  because
[2876.20 --> 2877.84]  all have sinned
[2877.84 --> 2879.10]  and fall short of the glory of God.
[2879.26 --> 2879.78]  So therefore,
[2880.08 --> 2881.04]  we are all
[2881.04 --> 2882.52]  slaves to sin.
[2882.62 --> 2884.02]  We are all captivated by sin.
[2885.16 --> 2886.66]  Now, what do I mean by that?
[2887.36 --> 2887.54]  Okay,
[2887.66 --> 2888.36]  so let me,
[2888.48 --> 2889.78]  let's think of that phrase
[2889.78 --> 2890.34]  for a moment.
[2890.34 --> 2891.12]  If I say
[2891.12 --> 2893.20]  I am captivated
[2893.20 --> 2894.28]  by something,
[2895.08 --> 2897.16]  what do I mean by that?
[2899.32 --> 2900.22]  Well, I could mean
[2900.22 --> 2901.24]  one of two things.
[2902.16 --> 2903.34]  On the one hand,
[2903.42 --> 2903.96]  I could mean
[2903.96 --> 2904.78]  that I am actually
[2904.78 --> 2907.34]  literally held captive, right?
[2908.28 --> 2908.72]  Like,
[2909.08 --> 2909.98]  I could mean that
[2909.98 --> 2911.74]  I'm being held prisoner.
[2912.30 --> 2913.22]  I could mean that
[2913.22 --> 2914.36]  I am a slave to something.
[2914.56 --> 2915.78]  I am being held captive.
[2916.60 --> 2917.66]  I'm captivated.
[2917.66 --> 2920.62]  But what we also mean by that
[2920.62 --> 2921.38]  is something very different.
[2921.52 --> 2922.20]  I could mean
[2922.20 --> 2923.90]  that I am absolutely
[2923.90 --> 2926.06]  delighted with something,
[2926.30 --> 2926.54]  right?
[2926.90 --> 2929.04]  So if I go to a movie
[2929.04 --> 2929.94]  and I come out
[2929.94 --> 2930.44]  and I say,
[2930.70 --> 2930.96]  wow,
[2931.04 --> 2932.90]  I was captivated
[2932.90 --> 2934.86]  by that story,
[2935.44 --> 2936.60]  I don't mean that
[2936.60 --> 2937.36]  I was held hostage
[2937.36 --> 2938.14]  in the movie theater,
[2938.98 --> 2940.12]  although with movies
[2940.12 --> 2941.08]  these days,
[2941.20 --> 2942.00]  very long,
[2942.10 --> 2942.80]  sometimes you feel
[2942.80 --> 2943.44]  you're held captive.
[2943.44 --> 2946.26]  But what I mean
[2946.26 --> 2947.50]  is that I
[2947.50 --> 2949.28]  was delighted
[2949.28 --> 2950.52]  by that story.
[2950.58 --> 2951.68]  It captivated me.
[2952.94 --> 2954.30]  So what is Paul saying?
[2955.86 --> 2956.98]  In saying that
[2956.98 --> 2958.40]  we are captivated by sin,
[2958.92 --> 2959.88]  he means both.
[2960.88 --> 2961.72]  He means both.
[2962.04 --> 2962.96]  So let me explain that.
[2963.06 --> 2963.88]  It means, first of all,
[2963.90 --> 2965.58]  that we are captivated
[2965.58 --> 2966.32]  by sin
[2966.32 --> 2966.94]  in the sense
[2966.94 --> 2967.88]  that we are enslaved
[2967.88 --> 2968.46]  by sin.
[2969.14 --> 2970.20]  We are held
[2970.20 --> 2971.00]  prisoner
[2971.00 --> 2972.54]  by sin.
[2973.50 --> 2974.48]  And Paul said earlier,
[2974.48 --> 2975.76]  we saw this last week
[2975.76 --> 2976.98]  in Romans chapter 3,
[2977.04 --> 2977.50]  verse 9,
[2977.66 --> 2978.02]  he said,
[2978.34 --> 2979.70]  Jews and Gentiles alike
[2979.70 --> 2981.50]  are under the power
[2981.50 --> 2982.96]  of sin.
[2984.34 --> 2985.48]  And what he means there
[2985.48 --> 2986.40]  is that
[2986.40 --> 2987.68]  we are enslaved.
[2988.12 --> 2989.86]  Just as Israel
[2989.86 --> 2990.92]  was enslaved
[2990.92 --> 2991.72]  by Pharaoh
[2991.72 --> 2992.54]  in Egypt,
[2993.26 --> 2994.54]  in the same way
[2994.54 --> 2996.48]  we are sin's captives.
[2997.32 --> 2998.44]  Sin kind of stands
[2998.44 --> 2999.86]  over and against us
[2999.86 --> 3000.66]  with a whip
[3000.66 --> 3002.56]  as a taskmaster
[3002.56 --> 3003.28]  over us,
[3003.66 --> 3004.48]  never letting us
[3004.48 --> 3004.94]  go free.
[3006.14 --> 3006.90]  And that is why
[3006.90 --> 3007.94]  we desperately need
[3007.94 --> 3009.66]  God's righteousness.
[3009.88 --> 3010.66]  We need redemption.
[3011.28 --> 3011.40]  Right?
[3011.46 --> 3012.26]  We need the righteousness
[3012.26 --> 3012.86]  of God
[3012.86 --> 3013.52]  to come
[3013.52 --> 3015.10]  and break us free,
[3015.28 --> 3016.20]  set us free,
[3016.78 --> 3017.44]  redeem us,
[3017.46 --> 3018.42]  and purchase us back
[3018.42 --> 3019.14]  just like he did
[3019.14 --> 3019.62]  with Egypt.
[3020.14 --> 3021.32]  Just like he
[3021.32 --> 3022.66]  rested his people
[3022.66 --> 3024.82]  out of the grip
[3024.82 --> 3025.54]  of slavery
[3025.54 --> 3027.82]  and redeemed them.
[3028.04 --> 3029.18]  That's what we need to.
[3029.18 --> 3031.90]  But,
[3032.10 --> 3033.54]  it's more sticky
[3033.54 --> 3034.00]  than that.
[3034.88 --> 3036.18]  The problem is
[3036.18 --> 3036.84]  we're also
[3036.84 --> 3038.34]  captivated by sin
[3038.34 --> 3039.22]  in the other way.
[3040.00 --> 3040.84]  And this makes
[3040.84 --> 3041.32]  the problem
[3041.32 --> 3041.90]  more difficult.
[3042.90 --> 3044.00]  Because we are
[3044.00 --> 3045.14]  all captivated
[3045.14 --> 3045.66]  by sin
[3045.66 --> 3046.38]  in the sense
[3046.38 --> 3047.14]  that we all
[3047.14 --> 3048.76]  delight in sin.
[3049.86 --> 3050.38]  Right?
[3050.46 --> 3051.32]  Don't we delight
[3051.32 --> 3051.78]  in sin?
[3052.12 --> 3052.78]  Isn't that why
[3052.78 --> 3053.72]  you sin?
[3054.18 --> 3054.58]  Isn't that why
[3054.58 --> 3055.20]  you do sin?
[3056.18 --> 3056.40]  You know,
[3056.48 --> 3057.18]  and whenever
[3057.18 --> 3057.76]  you sin,
[3057.88 --> 3058.26]  you do,
[3058.46 --> 3059.88]  whenever you sin,
[3060.38 --> 3061.22]  in that moment,
[3062.04 --> 3062.62]  you are
[3062.62 --> 3063.46]  delighting
[3063.46 --> 3064.50]  in that sin
[3064.50 --> 3065.54]  more than
[3065.54 --> 3065.80]  you are
[3065.80 --> 3066.24]  delighting
[3066.24 --> 3066.60]  in God.
[3067.34 --> 3067.82]  Otherwise,
[3068.06 --> 3068.56]  if you're
[3068.56 --> 3069.04]  delaying God
[3069.04 --> 3069.26]  more,
[3069.34 --> 3069.60]  you wouldn't
[3069.60 --> 3069.84]  have done
[3069.84 --> 3070.22]  that sin.
[3070.76 --> 3070.96]  So,
[3071.00 --> 3071.48]  whenever you sin,
[3071.54 --> 3071.64]  you're
[3071.64 --> 3072.06]  delighting
[3072.06 --> 3072.46]  in that
[3072.46 --> 3073.00]  more than
[3073.00 --> 3073.14]  you're
[3073.14 --> 3073.48]  delighting
[3073.48 --> 3073.88]  in God.
[3075.16 --> 3075.86]  And because
[3075.86 --> 3076.22]  we are
[3076.22 --> 3076.94]  captivated
[3076.94 --> 3077.42]  by sin
[3077.42 --> 3078.20]  in this way,
[3078.34 --> 3078.84]  we are
[3078.84 --> 3079.16]  totally
[3079.16 --> 3079.62]  unable
[3079.62 --> 3080.26]  to free
[3080.26 --> 3080.78]  ourselves.
[3081.98 --> 3082.18]  And so,
[3082.26 --> 3082.94]  I think the Bible
[3082.94 --> 3083.58]  is just so
[3083.58 --> 3084.68]  deeply perceptive
[3084.68 --> 3085.14]  about the
[3085.14 --> 3085.50]  nature
[3085.50 --> 3086.06]  of our
[3086.06 --> 3086.46]  problem.
[3087.28 --> 3088.02]  Because the
[3088.02 --> 3088.60]  problem isn't
[3088.60 --> 3089.12]  just that we
[3089.12 --> 3089.56]  sin,
[3090.52 --> 3090.94]  but that we
[3090.94 --> 3091.40]  are slaves
[3091.40 --> 3091.82]  to sin.
[3092.46 --> 3092.66]  Right?
[3092.70 --> 3093.18]  If the problem
[3093.18 --> 3093.74]  was just that
[3093.74 --> 3094.84]  we do sin
[3094.84 --> 3095.30]  or we sin
[3095.30 --> 3095.90]  occasionally,
[3096.20 --> 3097.02]  the solution
[3097.02 --> 3097.60]  would be
[3097.60 --> 3099.14]  moral instruction
[3099.14 --> 3100.48]  or just
[3100.48 --> 3101.50]  stop doing
[3101.50 --> 3102.58]  that or
[3102.58 --> 3103.42]  obey better.
[3105.18 --> 3105.86]  But we're
[3105.86 --> 3106.66]  captivated by
[3106.66 --> 3106.84]  sin,
[3106.90 --> 3107.42]  so we need
[3107.42 --> 3107.92]  rescue.
[3108.50 --> 3108.94]  We need
[3108.94 --> 3109.46]  redemption.
[3110.78 --> 3111.62]  And I think
[3111.62 --> 3112.40]  a great example
[3112.40 --> 3113.16]  of this is
[3113.16 --> 3113.76]  C.S. Lewis'
[3113.76 --> 3114.26]  book,
[3114.36 --> 3114.88]  The Chronicles
[3114.88 --> 3115.34]  of Narnia.
[3115.66 --> 3115.78]  Right?
[3115.84 --> 3116.34]  In the first
[3116.34 --> 3116.64]  book,
[3116.70 --> 3116.90]  if you're
[3116.90 --> 3117.42]  familiar with
[3117.42 --> 3117.68]  that,
[3118.18 --> 3118.50]  The Lion,
[3118.60 --> 3118.78]  the Witch,
[3118.80 --> 3118.96]  and the
[3118.96 --> 3119.32]  Wardrobe,
[3119.98 --> 3120.52]  there's this
[3120.52 --> 3121.16]  great scene
[3121.16 --> 3122.18]  with Edmund,
[3122.32 --> 3122.76]  one of the
[3122.76 --> 3124.94]  four Pevensey
[3124.94 --> 3125.34]  children,
[3125.96 --> 3126.72]  and Edmund
[3126.72 --> 3128.28]  encounters the
[3128.28 --> 3129.34]  White Witch.
[3130.08 --> 3131.18]  The White Witch,
[3131.46 --> 3132.06]  what does she
[3132.06 --> 3132.88]  offer Edmund?
[3134.34 --> 3135.34]  Turkish delight.
[3136.12 --> 3136.38]  Do you know?
[3137.22 --> 3137.96]  Turkish delight.
[3138.10 --> 3138.84]  It's this kind
[3138.84 --> 3139.46]  of confection
[3139.46 --> 3140.22]  candy,
[3140.34 --> 3140.54]  right?
[3141.26 --> 3142.40]  And he eats
[3142.40 --> 3142.78]  it,
[3142.78 --> 3143.54]  and he's
[3143.54 --> 3143.94]  just like,
[3144.10 --> 3144.54]  wow,
[3144.84 --> 3145.76]  this is so
[3145.76 --> 3146.22]  delicious.
[3146.42 --> 3147.10]  He's amazed.
[3147.72 --> 3148.30]  And of course,
[3148.40 --> 3148.58]  you know,
[3148.64 --> 3149.22]  every kid who
[3149.22 --> 3149.86]  reads that book
[3149.86 --> 3150.28]  is like,
[3150.82 --> 3152.12]  where can I get
[3152.12 --> 3152.50]  some Turkish
[3152.50 --> 3152.86]  delight?
[3153.02 --> 3153.20]  Right?
[3153.22 --> 3153.48]  Because they
[3153.48 --> 3154.08]  want to try
[3154.08 --> 3154.36]  this.
[3155.22 --> 3155.92]  But the White
[3155.92 --> 3156.74]  Witch says,
[3157.38 --> 3157.90]  I'll tell you
[3157.90 --> 3158.10]  what,
[3158.20 --> 3158.96]  I'll give you
[3158.96 --> 3159.90]  as much
[3159.90 --> 3161.00]  Turkish delight
[3161.00 --> 3161.56]  as you can
[3161.56 --> 3162.30]  possibly eat,
[3162.36 --> 3162.94]  and I will
[3162.94 --> 3163.86]  make you king.
[3164.56 --> 3165.16]  I will make
[3165.16 --> 3166.44]  you a co-ruler
[3166.44 --> 3167.58]  of Narnia
[3167.58 --> 3168.32]  with me.
[3168.96 --> 3169.62]  All you have
[3169.62 --> 3170.62]  to do is
[3170.62 --> 3171.42]  bring me your
[3171.42 --> 3172.02]  brother and
[3172.02 --> 3172.46]  your sisters.
[3173.54 --> 3173.98]  So Edmund
[3173.98 --> 3174.40]  thinks,
[3174.82 --> 3175.52]  great deal.
[3176.24 --> 3176.82]  More Turkish
[3176.82 --> 3177.52]  delight for me,
[3177.68 --> 3178.34]  I can kind of
[3178.34 --> 3179.14]  lord it over
[3179.14 --> 3179.98]  my siblings
[3179.98 --> 3180.48]  who,
[3180.60 --> 3180.90]  you know,
[3181.32 --> 3182.50]  I don't like
[3182.50 --> 3183.02]  that much.
[3183.38 --> 3183.90]  And so he
[3183.90 --> 3184.82]  betrays his
[3184.82 --> 3185.42]  brother and
[3185.42 --> 3185.92]  his sisters.
[3186.84 --> 3187.24]  And when
[3187.24 --> 3187.94]  then he goes
[3187.94 --> 3188.38]  to the White
[3188.38 --> 3188.98]  Witch to
[3188.98 --> 3190.28]  collect his
[3190.28 --> 3190.78]  reward,
[3190.98 --> 3191.60]  he's completely
[3191.60 --> 3192.08]  shocked.
[3192.74 --> 3193.40]  When instead
[3193.40 --> 3193.94]  of the
[3193.94 --> 3195.16]  rewards and
[3195.16 --> 3195.72]  the life
[3195.72 --> 3196.22]  that he was
[3196.22 --> 3196.90]  expecting to
[3196.90 --> 3197.62]  get and that
[3197.62 --> 3197.92]  he was
[3197.92 --> 3198.46]  promised,
[3198.88 --> 3199.24]  the White
[3199.24 --> 3199.52]  Witch,
[3199.58 --> 3199.78]  what does
[3199.78 --> 3200.12]  she do?
[3200.90 --> 3201.42]  She throws
[3201.42 --> 3201.70]  him in
[3201.70 --> 3203.02]  prison and
[3203.02 --> 3203.60]  makes him
[3203.60 --> 3204.38]  her slave.
[3205.12 --> 3205.84]  And he's
[3205.84 --> 3206.24]  just so
[3206.24 --> 3207.28]  confused and
[3207.28 --> 3207.56]  he's like,
[3207.64 --> 3208.04]  what's going
[3208.04 --> 3208.26]  on?
[3208.32 --> 3208.58]  What are you
[3208.58 --> 3208.94]  doing to
[3208.94 --> 3209.18]  me?
[3209.48 --> 3209.94]  May I
[3209.94 --> 3210.58]  have more
[3210.58 --> 3211.02]  Turkish
[3211.02 --> 3211.54]  delight?
[3212.70 --> 3213.18]  He's
[3213.18 --> 3213.88]  enslaved and
[3213.88 --> 3214.14]  he's like
[3214.14 --> 3214.64]  asking for
[3214.64 --> 3214.96]  Turkish
[3214.96 --> 3215.34]  delight.
[3216.50 --> 3217.10]  And I
[3217.10 --> 3217.80]  think C.S.
[3217.84 --> 3218.32]  Lewis here
[3218.32 --> 3218.82]  is really
[3218.82 --> 3219.34]  giving us
[3219.34 --> 3219.80]  a great
[3219.80 --> 3221.44]  picture of
[3221.44 --> 3221.70]  what it
[3221.70 --> 3222.14]  looks like
[3222.14 --> 3222.42]  to be
[3222.42 --> 3223.26]  captivated by
[3223.26 --> 3223.52]  sin.
[3224.28 --> 3225.10]  The Bible
[3225.10 --> 3225.66]  tells us
[3225.66 --> 3226.56]  that all
[3226.56 --> 3227.06]  of us
[3227.06 --> 3228.06]  are just
[3228.06 --> 3228.32]  like
[3228.32 --> 3228.66]  Edmund.
[3229.60 --> 3230.38]  All of
[3230.38 --> 3230.66]  us are
[3230.66 --> 3231.28]  captives.
[3231.88 --> 3232.76]  We're all
[3232.76 --> 3233.66]  prisoners to
[3233.66 --> 3234.36]  sin and
[3234.36 --> 3234.66]  death.
[3234.96 --> 3235.50]  We cannot
[3235.50 --> 3236.24]  break free
[3236.24 --> 3237.34]  and we
[3237.34 --> 3238.06]  cannot escape.
[3239.42 --> 3240.34]  So who
[3240.34 --> 3241.26]  will rescue
[3241.26 --> 3241.64]  us?
[3243.50 --> 3244.34]  Well, if you
[3244.34 --> 3244.62]  know the
[3244.62 --> 3245.38]  story, you
[3245.38 --> 3245.72]  know that
[3245.72 --> 3246.40]  Aslan, who
[3246.40 --> 3246.68]  is the
[3246.68 --> 3247.38]  great lion,
[3247.96 --> 3248.96]  this Christ-like
[3248.96 --> 3249.40]  figure in
[3249.40 --> 3249.86]  the story,
[3250.50 --> 3251.52]  he has a
[3251.52 --> 3251.92]  private
[3251.92 --> 3253.16]  conference with
[3253.16 --> 3253.50]  the White
[3253.50 --> 3253.84]  Witch.
[3254.66 --> 3255.24]  And through
[3255.24 --> 3255.68]  some
[3255.68 --> 3256.54]  negotiation,
[3256.82 --> 3257.32]  Aslan is
[3257.32 --> 3257.78]  able to
[3257.78 --> 3258.44]  secure
[3258.44 --> 3259.64]  Edmund's
[3259.64 --> 3260.42]  release.
[3261.50 --> 3262.06]  The White
[3262.06 --> 3262.86]  Witch releases
[3262.86 --> 3263.58]  her claim on
[3263.58 --> 3264.98]  him, but
[3264.98 --> 3265.62]  only in
[3265.62 --> 3267.04]  exchange for
[3267.04 --> 3268.00]  Aslan offering
[3268.00 --> 3269.74]  his life as
[3269.74 --> 3270.18]  a ransom.
[3271.36 --> 3271.88]  And this,
[3272.00 --> 3272.56]  friends, is a
[3272.56 --> 3274.26]  great picture of
[3274.26 --> 3275.20]  our redemption
[3275.20 --> 3276.44]  in Christ.
[3277.36 --> 3278.22]  So Jesus
[3278.22 --> 3278.80]  says in
[3278.80 --> 3279.94]  Matthew 20
[3279.94 --> 3281.92]  28, he
[3281.92 --> 3282.22]  says,
[3282.60 --> 3283.22]  just as the
[3283.22 --> 3283.90]  Son of Man
[3283.90 --> 3284.52]  did not come
[3284.52 --> 3285.26]  to be served,
[3285.32 --> 3286.22]  but to serve,
[3286.80 --> 3287.40]  we're all
[3287.40 --> 3287.84]  familiar with
[3287.84 --> 3288.84]  that part, but
[3288.84 --> 3289.24]  how does the
[3289.24 --> 3289.82]  verse continue?
[3290.90 --> 3291.66]  And to give
[3291.66 --> 3293.22]  his life as a
[3293.22 --> 3294.42]  ransom for
[3294.42 --> 3294.74]  many.
[3296.76 --> 3297.70]  Friends, Jesus
[3297.70 --> 3299.00]  had to die
[3299.00 --> 3300.72]  to ransom us.
[3301.26 --> 3301.92]  He had to
[3301.92 --> 3302.40]  take our
[3302.40 --> 3302.72]  place.
[3302.80 --> 3303.24]  He had to
[3303.24 --> 3304.96]  purchase us
[3304.96 --> 3305.56]  out of
[3305.56 --> 3306.24]  slavery to
[3306.24 --> 3307.02]  sin and
[3307.02 --> 3307.58]  to death.
[3308.74 --> 3309.34]  And so
[3309.34 --> 3309.86]  that was
[3309.86 --> 3310.74]  the cost
[3310.74 --> 3311.62]  to God
[3311.62 --> 3314.34]  of our
[3314.34 --> 3314.98]  gift of
[3314.98 --> 3315.36]  righteousness.
[3316.32 --> 3316.48]  Right?
[3317.48 --> 3318.50]  He paid
[3318.50 --> 3319.02]  for our
[3319.02 --> 3320.22]  freedom by
[3320.22 --> 3321.10]  redeeming us.
[3322.82 --> 3323.00]  And so
[3323.00 --> 3323.78]  now, the
[3323.78 --> 3324.78]  second word
[3324.78 --> 3325.32]  that Paul
[3325.32 --> 3326.50]  uses is
[3326.50 --> 3326.80]  the word
[3326.80 --> 3327.34]  atonement.
[3328.06 --> 3328.54]  So look
[3328.54 --> 3328.96]  with me
[3328.96 --> 3329.72]  at verse
[3329.72 --> 3330.46]  25.
[3331.78 --> 3332.44]  It says,
[3332.80 --> 3333.44]  God presented
[3333.44 --> 3334.64]  Christ as a
[3334.64 --> 3335.86]  sacrifice of
[3335.86 --> 3336.46]  atonement
[3336.46 --> 3337.54]  through the
[3337.54 --> 3337.98]  shedding of
[3337.98 --> 3338.48]  his blood
[3338.48 --> 3339.50]  to be
[3339.50 --> 3340.08]  received by
[3340.08 --> 3340.52]  faith.
[3342.44 --> 3343.54]  It's not a
[3343.54 --> 3344.36]  common word
[3344.36 --> 3345.08]  in the New
[3345.08 --> 3345.44]  Testament,
[3346.20 --> 3346.82]  this word
[3346.82 --> 3347.34]  atonement.
[3347.58 --> 3348.10]  It's not
[3348.10 --> 3348.56]  really a
[3348.56 --> 3349.16]  common word
[3349.16 --> 3349.84]  in everyday
[3349.84 --> 3351.26]  language either.
[3351.38 --> 3351.80]  You probably
[3351.80 --> 3352.40]  did not use
[3352.40 --> 3352.74]  the word
[3352.74 --> 3353.28]  atonement
[3353.28 --> 3353.66]  in your
[3353.66 --> 3354.26]  text threads
[3354.26 --> 3354.90]  this week.
[3355.90 --> 3356.60]  So what
[3356.60 --> 3356.88]  does it
[3356.88 --> 3357.12]  mean?
[3358.12 --> 3358.38]  Well,
[3358.46 --> 3359.10]  really what
[3359.10 --> 3359.50]  it is,
[3359.56 --> 3359.90]  it's an
[3359.90 --> 3360.88]  appeasing of
[3360.88 --> 3361.24]  one,
[3361.32 --> 3361.98]  namely God,
[3361.98 --> 3363.14]  who has
[3363.14 --> 3363.74]  been offended
[3363.74 --> 3364.34]  by our
[3364.34 --> 3364.66]  sin,
[3365.42 --> 3365.56]  right,
[3365.62 --> 3366.26]  who we
[3366.26 --> 3366.80]  have sinned
[3366.80 --> 3367.22]  against.
[3368.60 --> 3369.14]  And so
[3369.14 --> 3370.20]  here is
[3370.20 --> 3371.42]  the terrible,
[3371.88 --> 3372.90]  awful dilemma
[3372.90 --> 3373.48]  that we are
[3373.48 --> 3373.74]  in.
[3374.40 --> 3374.96]  The dilemma
[3374.96 --> 3375.46]  is this,
[3375.50 --> 3376.14]  not only
[3376.14 --> 3376.96]  are we
[3376.96 --> 3377.74]  victims of
[3377.74 --> 3377.92]  sin,
[3378.00 --> 3378.36]  not only
[3378.36 --> 3378.68]  are we
[3378.68 --> 3379.58]  enslaved by
[3379.58 --> 3379.82]  sin,
[3379.88 --> 3380.16]  where sin
[3380.16 --> 3380.42]  is our
[3380.42 --> 3381.12]  taskmaster,
[3381.46 --> 3381.76]  and we
[3381.76 --> 3382.56]  are captives,
[3383.12 --> 3384.56]  but also
[3384.56 --> 3385.62]  we are
[3385.62 --> 3386.32]  perpetrators
[3386.32 --> 3386.78]  of sin.
[3387.20 --> 3387.62]  Not just
[3387.62 --> 3388.08]  victims,
[3388.36 --> 3389.06]  but perpetrators.
[3389.06 --> 3390.34]  We delight
[3390.34 --> 3390.96]  in sin,
[3391.46 --> 3392.44]  and it
[3392.44 --> 3393.26]  leads us
[3393.26 --> 3394.46]  to despise
[3394.46 --> 3395.36]  God and
[3395.36 --> 3395.72]  to then
[3395.72 --> 3396.22]  carry out
[3396.22 --> 3396.66]  all kinds
[3396.66 --> 3397.02]  of evil.
[3397.64 --> 3398.24]  We know
[3398.24 --> 3398.58]  this.
[3399.50 --> 3399.88]  And if
[3399.88 --> 3400.22]  that is
[3400.22 --> 3400.60]  true,
[3401.60 --> 3402.16]  how is
[3402.16 --> 3402.86]  God going
[3402.86 --> 3403.48]  to free
[3403.48 --> 3404.44]  us from
[3404.44 --> 3405.24]  our captivity
[3405.24 --> 3406.82]  to sin
[3406.82 --> 3407.44]  without
[3407.44 --> 3408.22]  crushing
[3408.22 --> 3410.26]  us under
[3410.26 --> 3410.86]  the weight
[3410.86 --> 3411.30]  of his
[3411.30 --> 3412.26]  hostility
[3412.26 --> 3413.30]  towards sin
[3413.30 --> 3413.66]  and evil?
[3415.02 --> 3415.70]  Do you
[3415.70 --> 3415.92]  see the
[3415.92 --> 3416.22]  problem?
[3417.38 --> 3418.38]  The easiest
[3418.38 --> 3418.98]  way for
[3418.98 --> 3419.58]  God to
[3419.58 --> 3420.00]  defeat
[3420.00 --> 3420.60]  evil
[3420.60 --> 3421.20]  in the
[3421.20 --> 3421.56]  world
[3421.56 --> 3422.44]  is to
[3422.44 --> 3422.82]  defeat
[3422.82 --> 3423.34]  those who
[3423.34 --> 3424.02]  are evil,
[3424.48 --> 3425.42]  those who
[3425.42 --> 3426.08]  do evil,
[3426.58 --> 3426.94]  but that
[3426.94 --> 3427.16]  means
[3427.16 --> 3427.52]  defeating
[3427.52 --> 3427.94]  us.
[3429.74 --> 3430.42]  And so
[3430.42 --> 3430.82]  the question
[3430.82 --> 3431.32]  comes up
[3431.32 --> 3431.62]  then,
[3432.50 --> 3433.16]  how is
[3433.16 --> 3433.66]  this tension
[3433.66 --> 3434.08]  going to
[3434.08 --> 3434.60]  be resolved?
[3435.30 --> 3435.82]  How is
[3435.82 --> 3436.40]  God in
[3436.40 --> 3436.72]  his
[3436.72 --> 3437.40]  righteousness
[3437.40 --> 3437.84]  going to
[3437.84 --> 3438.74]  throw down
[3438.74 --> 3439.86]  all evil
[3439.86 --> 3440.96]  and sin
[3440.96 --> 3442.44]  but save
[3442.44 --> 3442.88]  those he
[3442.88 --> 3443.22]  loves?
[3444.44 --> 3445.26]  How is
[3445.26 --> 3445.54]  he going
[3445.54 --> 3446.18]  to defeat
[3446.18 --> 3447.12]  evil to
[3447.12 --> 3447.60]  make all
[3447.60 --> 3448.34]  things right
[3448.34 --> 3449.66]  and to
[3449.66 --> 3450.12]  save
[3450.12 --> 3450.74]  sinners
[3450.74 --> 3451.92]  like us
[3451.92 --> 3452.80]  whom he
[3452.80 --> 3453.10]  loves?
[3453.18 --> 3453.50]  How is
[3453.50 --> 3453.74]  he going
[3453.74 --> 3453.96]  to do
[3453.96 --> 3454.22]  that?
[3456.46 --> 3456.90]  Now
[3456.90 --> 3457.30]  here's
[3457.30 --> 3457.84]  what we
[3457.84 --> 3458.70]  often think
[3458.70 --> 3459.06]  that God
[3459.06 --> 3459.48]  should do.
[3460.96 --> 3461.66]  We like
[3461.66 --> 3461.96]  to be
[3461.96 --> 3462.26]  God's
[3462.26 --> 3462.62]  advisors,
[3462.80 --> 3463.10]  don't we?
[3464.16 --> 3464.72]  We all
[3464.72 --> 3465.10]  do this.
[3465.18 --> 3465.30]  Like,
[3465.40 --> 3465.86]  I like
[3465.86 --> 3466.22]  to advise
[3466.22 --> 3466.56]  God all
[3466.56 --> 3466.88]  the time
[3466.88 --> 3467.76]  about what
[3467.76 --> 3468.04]  he should
[3468.04 --> 3468.24]  do in
[3468.24 --> 3468.78]  my life,
[3468.90 --> 3469.32]  what should
[3469.32 --> 3469.70]  happen.
[3470.08 --> 3470.52]  We like
[3470.52 --> 3470.90]  to advise
[3470.90 --> 3471.24]  God,
[3471.56 --> 3472.46]  and we
[3472.46 --> 3473.70]  have these
[3473.70 --> 3474.50]  ideas about
[3474.50 --> 3474.96]  what God
[3474.96 --> 3475.38]  should do.
[3475.38 --> 3475.96]  So if I
[3475.96 --> 3476.46]  was God's
[3476.46 --> 3476.84]  advisor,
[3477.16 --> 3477.90]  I would
[3477.90 --> 3478.18]  have a
[3478.18 --> 3478.70]  very simple
[3478.70 --> 3479.70]  way of
[3479.70 --> 3480.54]  resolving this
[3480.54 --> 3481.04]  tension.
[3481.74 --> 3482.34]  What I
[3482.34 --> 3482.64]  would do
[3482.64 --> 3482.84]  is I
[3482.84 --> 3483.08]  would say
[3483.08 --> 3483.54]  to God,
[3483.66 --> 3483.98]  God,
[3484.12 --> 3484.72]  here's what
[3484.72 --> 3484.96]  you should
[3484.96 --> 3485.24]  do.
[3485.84 --> 3487.24]  Just turn
[3487.24 --> 3488.40]  down the
[3488.40 --> 3489.74]  dial on
[3489.74 --> 3490.88]  your hostility
[3490.88 --> 3491.84]  to evil
[3491.84 --> 3492.32]  and sin.
[3493.50 --> 3494.26]  And at the
[3494.26 --> 3495.02]  same time,
[3495.16 --> 3495.80]  just turn
[3495.80 --> 3496.94]  up the
[3496.94 --> 3498.04]  dial on
[3498.04 --> 3498.62]  your love
[3498.62 --> 3499.42]  and compassion
[3499.42 --> 3499.86]  for people
[3499.86 --> 3500.36]  like me.
[3500.36 --> 3502.16]  to the
[3502.16 --> 3502.78]  point where
[3502.78 --> 3504.38]  you leave
[3504.38 --> 3504.82]  me in
[3504.82 --> 3505.56]  my sin,
[3505.74 --> 3506.16]  where I
[3506.16 --> 3506.74]  just delight
[3506.74 --> 3507.28]  in my sin
[3507.28 --> 3507.54]  and go
[3507.54 --> 3508.12]  merrily on
[3508.12 --> 3508.68]  my way.
[3509.82 --> 3510.36]  That's how
[3510.36 --> 3510.56]  you can
[3510.56 --> 3510.86]  solve this
[3510.86 --> 3511.18]  problem.
[3511.78 --> 3511.96]  Just
[3511.96 --> 3512.84]  stop being
[3512.84 --> 3514.02]  so hostile
[3514.02 --> 3514.64]  to evil,
[3515.48 --> 3516.38]  be more
[3516.38 --> 3517.38]  compassionate,
[3518.38 --> 3519.22]  and then I
[3519.22 --> 3519.48]  will just
[3519.48 --> 3519.78]  stay in
[3519.78 --> 3520.30]  my sin
[3520.30 --> 3521.26]  and everything
[3521.26 --> 3521.56]  will be
[3521.56 --> 3521.86]  fine.
[3524.46 --> 3525.04]  That's what
[3525.04 --> 3525.42]  we think
[3525.42 --> 3525.94]  God should
[3525.94 --> 3526.24]  do.
[3526.94 --> 3527.36]  Thankfully,
[3527.62 --> 3528.18]  I am not
[3528.18 --> 3528.80]  God's advisor,
[3529.14 --> 3529.56]  and thankfully
[3529.56 --> 3530.22]  God does
[3530.22 --> 3530.56]  not do
[3530.56 --> 3530.94]  that.
[3531.52 --> 3532.00]  Because
[3532.00 --> 3533.18]  God cannot
[3533.18 --> 3533.94]  do that.
[3534.88 --> 3535.42]  God cannot
[3535.42 --> 3536.62]  let evil
[3536.62 --> 3537.60]  and sin
[3537.60 --> 3538.92]  go merrily
[3538.92 --> 3540.00]  along their
[3540.00 --> 3541.34]  way and
[3541.34 --> 3542.28]  still be a
[3542.28 --> 3542.90]  righteous and
[3542.90 --> 3543.46]  holy God.
[3544.76 --> 3545.40]  Right?
[3545.48 --> 3546.38]  He must act
[3546.38 --> 3547.00]  in accordance
[3547.00 --> 3547.92]  with his
[3547.92 --> 3548.44]  righteousness
[3548.44 --> 3549.26]  and holiness.
[3549.94 --> 3550.94]  He must do
[3550.94 --> 3552.00]  away with
[3552.00 --> 3552.60]  all sin
[3552.60 --> 3553.12]  and evil
[3553.12 --> 3553.90]  in his
[3553.90 --> 3554.32]  world.
[3555.10 --> 3555.70]  So what
[3555.70 --> 3556.16]  does God
[3556.16 --> 3556.50]  do?
[3557.76 --> 3558.14]  Well,
[3558.24 --> 3558.56]  God does
[3558.56 --> 3559.22]  not resolve
[3559.22 --> 3559.74]  the tension
[3559.74 --> 3560.10]  by,
[3560.22 --> 3561.22]  negotiating
[3561.22 --> 3561.98]  between
[3561.98 --> 3562.62]  his
[3562.62 --> 3563.32]  wrath
[3563.32 --> 3563.64]  against
[3563.64 --> 3563.92]  sin
[3563.92 --> 3564.26]  and
[3564.26 --> 3564.48]  his
[3564.48 --> 3564.74]  love
[3564.74 --> 3564.94]  for
[3564.94 --> 3565.22]  sinners.
[3565.92 --> 3566.24]  That's not
[3566.24 --> 3566.52]  what he
[3566.52 --> 3566.94]  does.
[3566.94 --> 3567.90]  He doesn't
[3567.90 --> 3568.78]  neglect the
[3568.78 --> 3569.32]  one and
[3569.32 --> 3570.72]  emphasize the
[3570.72 --> 3571.08]  other.
[3571.94 --> 3572.74]  What happens
[3572.74 --> 3573.60]  is God's
[3573.60 --> 3574.62]  hostility
[3574.62 --> 3575.56]  towards sin
[3575.56 --> 3576.82]  and
[3576.82 --> 3578.40]  his love
[3578.40 --> 3579.40]  for sinners
[3579.40 --> 3580.72]  both
[3580.72 --> 3582.38]  get dialed
[3582.38 --> 3582.88]  all the way
[3582.88 --> 3583.10]  up.
[3583.10 --> 3584.12]  God's
[3584.12 --> 3584.60]  love
[3584.60 --> 3585.10]  love
[3585.10 --> 3591.14]  God's
[3591.14 --> 3591.60]  love
[3591.60 --> 3592.20]  love
[3592.20 --> 3592.54]  and
[3592.54 --> 3593.20]  love
[3593.20 --> 3595.06]  He
[3595.06 --> 3595.68]  presses
[3595.68 --> 3596.40]  his
[3596.40 --> 3596.98]  righteousness
[3596.98 --> 3598.32]  to the
[3598.32 --> 3599.04]  extreme
[3599.04 --> 3599.76]  in both
[3599.76 --> 3600.72]  directions.
[3602.28 --> 3602.46]  And so
[3602.46 --> 3602.96]  where do we
[3602.96 --> 3603.56]  see then
[3603.56 --> 3604.20]  God's
[3604.20 --> 3605.40]  own
[3605.40 --> 3606.10]  righteousness
[3606.10 --> 3607.88]  his love
[3607.88 --> 3609.12]  anger
[3609.12 --> 3609.64]  against sin
[3609.64 --> 3610.16]  how do we
[3610.16 --> 3610.74]  see those
[3610.74 --> 3611.62]  get pushed
[3611.62 --> 3612.18]  to the
[3612.18 --> 3612.42]  extreme
[3612.42 --> 3612.76]  in both
[3612.76 --> 3613.24]  directions?
[3613.98 --> 3614.88]  We see it
[3614.88 --> 3615.12]  at the
[3615.12 --> 3615.52]  cross.
[3616.80 --> 3617.34]  Right?
[3617.42 --> 3617.96]  At the
[3617.96 --> 3618.32]  cross
[3618.32 --> 3618.68]  God's
[3618.68 --> 3619.30]  hostility
[3619.30 --> 3620.00]  against sin
[3620.00 --> 3620.74]  goes to
[3620.74 --> 3621.40]  the extreme
[3621.40 --> 3622.82]  because
[3622.82 --> 3623.66]  Jesus Christ
[3623.66 --> 3624.36]  when he hung
[3624.36 --> 3624.76]  there on
[3624.76 --> 3625.26]  the cross
[3625.26 --> 3625.82]  he was
[3625.82 --> 3626.44]  absorbing
[3626.44 --> 3628.02]  God's
[3628.02 --> 3628.70]  own
[3628.70 --> 3629.62]  hostility
[3629.62 --> 3630.76]  against sin
[3630.76 --> 3631.20]  and evil.
[3631.20 --> 3632.86]  That's
[3632.86 --> 3633.42]  what verse
[3633.42 --> 3634.32]  25 says
[3634.32 --> 3634.58]  this is
[3634.58 --> 3634.86]  what it's
[3634.86 --> 3635.34]  all about
[3635.34 --> 3636.08]  that God
[3636.08 --> 3636.72]  presented
[3636.72 --> 3637.50]  Christ as
[3637.50 --> 3638.18]  a sacrifice
[3638.18 --> 3638.92]  of atonement
[3638.92 --> 3639.76]  through the
[3639.76 --> 3640.10]  shedding
[3640.10 --> 3640.78]  of his
[3640.78 --> 3641.20]  blood.
[3643.28 --> 3643.60]  God
[3643.60 --> 3644.16]  could not
[3644.16 --> 3644.72]  tolerate
[3644.72 --> 3645.10]  sin
[3645.10 --> 3645.52]  forever
[3645.52 --> 3646.84]  but in
[3646.84 --> 3647.76]  his mercy
[3647.76 --> 3649.06]  he desired
[3649.06 --> 3649.68]  to save
[3649.68 --> 3650.00]  sinners
[3650.00 --> 3650.38]  like you
[3650.38 --> 3650.72]  and me.
[3651.72 --> 3652.28]  So instead
[3652.28 --> 3652.90]  of crushing
[3652.90 --> 3653.64]  us
[3653.64 --> 3654.56]  under the
[3654.56 --> 3655.00]  weight of
[3655.00 --> 3655.86]  his hostility
[3655.86 --> 3657.04]  against sin
[3657.04 --> 3657.62]  God
[3657.62 --> 3658.04]  presented
[3658.04 --> 3658.72]  himself.
[3659.84 --> 3660.12]  He
[3660.12 --> 3661.34]  took on
[3661.34 --> 3662.68]  his hostility
[3662.68 --> 3663.28]  against sin
[3663.28 --> 3663.74]  in the
[3663.74 --> 3664.26]  person of
[3664.26 --> 3664.80]  his son
[3664.80 --> 3665.40]  Jesus
[3665.40 --> 3665.94]  Christ.
[3669.14 --> 3670.22]  So Jesus
[3670.22 --> 3670.94]  on the
[3670.94 --> 3671.20]  cross
[3671.20 --> 3671.94]  absorbed
[3671.94 --> 3672.84]  the penalty
[3672.84 --> 3673.66]  for our
[3673.66 --> 3674.02]  sin
[3674.02 --> 3674.44]  and our
[3674.44 --> 3674.76]  guilt.
[3675.54 --> 3675.72]  Jesus
[3675.72 --> 3676.36]  came to
[3676.36 --> 3676.80]  do the
[3676.80 --> 3677.14]  will of
[3677.14 --> 3677.30]  his
[3677.30 --> 3677.62]  father
[3677.62 --> 3678.56]  and he
[3678.56 --> 3678.80]  said
[3678.80 --> 3679.36]  I will
[3679.36 --> 3679.86]  go
[3679.86 --> 3682.10]  and I
[3682.10 --> 3682.56]  will save
[3682.56 --> 3682.82]  them.
[3684.38 --> 3685.14]  And at
[3685.14 --> 3685.46]  the very
[3685.46 --> 3685.90]  same
[3685.90 --> 3686.42]  moment
[3686.42 --> 3687.90]  that God's
[3687.90 --> 3688.36]  wrath was
[3688.36 --> 3688.92]  being satisfied
[3688.92 --> 3689.24]  on the
[3689.24 --> 3689.48]  cross
[3689.48 --> 3689.84]  God's
[3689.84 --> 3690.22]  love
[3690.22 --> 3690.50]  for
[3690.50 --> 3690.88]  sinners
[3690.88 --> 3691.62]  also
[3691.62 --> 3692.02]  went to
[3692.02 --> 3692.20]  the
[3692.20 --> 3692.54]  absolute
[3692.54 --> 3693.10]  extreme.
[3694.10 --> 3694.74]  Because
[3694.74 --> 3695.48]  love is
[3695.48 --> 3695.94]  always
[3695.94 --> 3696.58]  measured
[3696.58 --> 3697.42]  by the
[3697.42 --> 3697.74]  willingness
[3697.74 --> 3698.06]  to
[3698.06 --> 3698.66]  sacrifice.
[3700.66 --> 3700.98]  And so
[3700.98 --> 3702.44]  no sacrifice
[3702.44 --> 3703.42]  in history
[3703.42 --> 3704.52]  could have
[3704.52 --> 3704.94]  been more
[3704.94 --> 3705.60]  extreme
[3705.60 --> 3706.38]  than God
[3706.38 --> 3707.04]  giving
[3707.04 --> 3707.64]  his own
[3707.64 --> 3708.16]  son
[3708.16 --> 3709.02]  to die
[3709.02 --> 3709.62]  for
[3709.62 --> 3709.98]  sinners.
[3711.28 --> 3711.40]  And
[3711.40 --> 3711.62]  therefore
[3711.62 --> 3712.40]  no love
[3712.40 --> 3712.98]  in history
[3712.98 --> 3713.70]  could have
[3713.70 --> 3714.36]  possibly been
[3714.36 --> 3715.06]  more costly
[3715.06 --> 3715.52]  than that.
[3716.82 --> 3717.62]  Listen to
[3717.62 --> 3717.98]  what the
[3717.98 --> 3719.62]  apostle John
[3719.62 --> 3720.40]  writes in
[3720.40 --> 3721.04]  1 John
[3721.04 --> 3722.70]  chapter 4
[3722.70 --> 3723.14]  verse 10.
[3723.30 --> 3723.60]  He says
[3723.60 --> 3723.82]  this,
[3723.90 --> 3724.18]  this is
[3724.18 --> 3724.52]  love,
[3725.62 --> 3726.10]  not that
[3726.10 --> 3726.62]  we loved
[3726.62 --> 3727.02]  God,
[3727.66 --> 3728.02]  but that
[3728.02 --> 3728.62]  he loved
[3728.62 --> 3729.74]  us and
[3729.74 --> 3730.36]  sent his
[3730.36 --> 3732.02]  son as
[3732.02 --> 3732.76]  an atoning
[3732.76 --> 3733.64]  sacrifice
[3733.64 --> 3734.84]  for our
[3734.84 --> 3735.18]  sins.
[3736.90 --> 3737.18]  And so
[3737.18 --> 3737.58]  do we hear
[3737.58 --> 3737.98]  what he is
[3737.98 --> 3738.50]  saying here?
[3739.76 --> 3739.90]  Right?
[3740.12 --> 3741.10]  God loved
[3741.10 --> 3741.90]  the objects
[3741.90 --> 3742.58]  of his
[3742.58 --> 3743.82]  wrath so
[3743.82 --> 3744.34]  much
[3744.34 --> 3746.02]  that he
[3746.02 --> 3746.56]  sent
[3746.56 --> 3746.96]  his
[3746.96 --> 3747.26]  son,
[3747.32 --> 3747.46]  he
[3747.46 --> 3747.94]  offered
[3747.94 --> 3748.26]  his
[3748.26 --> 3748.58]  son
[3748.58 --> 3749.46]  as
[3749.46 --> 3749.66]  a
[3749.66 --> 3750.22]  sacrifice
[3750.22 --> 3750.52]  of
[3750.52 --> 3750.98]  atonement.
[3754.86 --> 3755.34]  Right?
[3755.40 --> 3755.70]  That's how
[3755.70 --> 3756.00]  God's
[3756.00 --> 3756.50]  love gets
[3756.50 --> 3757.04]  turned all
[3757.04 --> 3757.36]  the way
[3757.36 --> 3757.92]  up to
[3757.92 --> 3758.12]  the
[3758.12 --> 3758.56]  extreme.
[3760.36 --> 3760.90]  And so
[3760.90 --> 3761.10]  let me
[3761.10 --> 3761.36]  give you
[3761.36 --> 3762.24]  an illustration
[3762.24 --> 3762.84]  of this
[3762.84 --> 3763.20]  that I've
[3763.20 --> 3763.44]  heard.
[3764.04 --> 3764.64]  I think
[3764.64 --> 3764.92]  it comes
[3764.92 --> 3765.26]  from Tim
[3765.26 --> 3765.52]  Keller.
[3766.72 --> 3767.38]  He says,
[3767.46 --> 3767.96]  imagine that
[3767.96 --> 3768.44]  you're walking
[3768.44 --> 3769.50]  along a set
[3769.50 --> 3769.88]  of train
[3769.88 --> 3770.46]  tracks with
[3770.46 --> 3770.92]  your friend
[3770.92 --> 3772.38]  and your
[3772.38 --> 3773.08]  friend turns
[3773.08 --> 3773.56]  to you
[3773.56 --> 3774.20]  and suddenly
[3774.20 --> 3774.78]  says,
[3775.00 --> 3775.84]  this is how
[3775.84 --> 3776.18]  much I
[3776.18 --> 3776.68]  love you.
[3777.28 --> 3777.64]  And he
[3777.64 --> 3778.48]  throws himself
[3778.48 --> 3779.08]  in front
[3779.08 --> 3779.46]  of an
[3779.46 --> 3779.96]  oncoming
[3779.96 --> 3780.38]  train
[3780.38 --> 3780.94]  and dies.
[3783.12 --> 3783.68]  Now,
[3783.76 --> 3784.06]  what would
[3784.06 --> 3784.48]  you say
[3784.48 --> 3784.90]  to that?
[3786.10 --> 3786.80]  You would
[3786.80 --> 3787.18]  say,
[3787.34 --> 3788.20]  that's
[3788.20 --> 3788.68]  crazy.
[3789.62 --> 3789.84]  Like,
[3789.90 --> 3790.52]  what is
[3790.52 --> 3791.14]  wrong with
[3791.14 --> 3791.38]  you?
[3791.90 --> 3792.60]  Why would
[3792.60 --> 3793.24]  you do
[3793.24 --> 3793.50]  that?
[3793.54 --> 3793.82]  That was
[3793.82 --> 3794.42]  pointless.
[3795.50 --> 3796.22]  That was
[3796.22 --> 3796.92]  a waste.
[3798.40 --> 3799.32]  But imagine
[3799.32 --> 3799.94]  this instead.
[3800.10 --> 3800.76]  Imagine that
[3800.76 --> 3801.58]  you are stuck
[3801.58 --> 3801.96]  on the
[3801.96 --> 3802.18]  train
[3802.18 --> 3802.54]  track.
[3803.86 --> 3804.54]  And your
[3804.54 --> 3805.20]  friend comes
[3805.20 --> 3806.38]  rushing to
[3806.38 --> 3806.94]  your rescue.
[3807.84 --> 3808.38]  And at the
[3808.38 --> 3809.04]  last moment,
[3809.20 --> 3809.84]  he pushes
[3809.84 --> 3810.22]  you to
[3810.22 --> 3811.44]  safety and
[3811.44 --> 3811.64]  in the
[3811.64 --> 3812.52]  process dies.
[3814.26 --> 3814.82]  Now,
[3814.96 --> 3815.40]  what would
[3815.40 --> 3815.70]  you say
[3815.70 --> 3816.04]  to that?
[3816.72 --> 3817.12]  You would
[3817.12 --> 3817.46]  say,
[3817.90 --> 3819.54]  look how
[3819.54 --> 3820.14]  my friend
[3820.14 --> 3820.72]  loved me.
[3821.84 --> 3822.10]  You would
[3822.10 --> 3822.28]  say,
[3822.44 --> 3823.38]  he sacrificed
[3823.38 --> 3824.78]  his life
[3824.78 --> 3826.02]  for me.
[3826.58 --> 3827.26]  That's how
[3827.26 --> 3827.78]  much he
[3827.78 --> 3828.22]  loved me.
[3829.54 --> 3830.12]  And John
[3830.12 --> 3830.70]  says in
[3830.70 --> 3832.02]  John 15
[3832.02 --> 3832.78]  verse 13,
[3832.90 --> 3833.50]  greater love
[3833.50 --> 3834.00]  has no
[3834.00 --> 3834.32]  one than
[3834.32 --> 3834.72]  this,
[3835.26 --> 3835.80]  that somebody
[3835.80 --> 3836.38]  lays down
[3836.38 --> 3837.06]  his life
[3837.06 --> 3837.92]  for his
[3837.92 --> 3838.32]  friends.
[3839.88 --> 3840.66]  And Jesus
[3840.66 --> 3841.28]  was talking
[3841.28 --> 3842.14]  about himself.
[3844.22 --> 3844.86]  And so,
[3844.94 --> 3845.20]  you see,
[3845.28 --> 3845.82]  unless you
[3845.82 --> 3846.56]  realize the
[3846.56 --> 3847.18]  danger you
[3847.18 --> 3847.76]  are in,
[3848.58 --> 3848.78]  right,
[3848.84 --> 3849.30]  the wrath
[3849.30 --> 3849.84]  of God,
[3849.92 --> 3850.58]  the hostility
[3850.58 --> 3851.02]  of God
[3851.02 --> 3851.70]  against your
[3851.70 --> 3852.14]  sin,
[3852.94 --> 3853.74]  you cannot
[3853.74 --> 3854.34]  then know
[3854.34 --> 3854.68]  what it
[3854.68 --> 3855.30]  costs God
[3855.30 --> 3855.72]  to love
[3855.72 --> 3856.04]  you and
[3856.04 --> 3856.56]  rescue you.
[3856.56 --> 3857.36]  God
[3857.36 --> 3858.08]  and that's
[3858.08 --> 3858.58]  how God
[3858.58 --> 3859.04]  can save
[3859.04 --> 3859.32]  us.
[3859.90 --> 3860.14]  He can
[3860.14 --> 3860.58]  save us
[3860.58 --> 3861.22]  righteously.
[3861.94 --> 3862.18]  He can
[3862.18 --> 3862.50]  be the
[3862.50 --> 3862.98]  God who
[3862.98 --> 3863.64]  is just
[3863.64 --> 3864.32]  and who
[3864.32 --> 3864.98]  justifies.
[3865.86 --> 3866.34]  He doesn't
[3866.34 --> 3866.82]  let sin
[3866.82 --> 3867.72]  go unpunished.
[3867.80 --> 3868.10]  Instead,
[3868.40 --> 3869.14]  he takes
[3869.14 --> 3870.02]  it upon
[3870.02 --> 3870.56]  himself.
[3872.06 --> 3872.38]  And friends,
[3872.46 --> 3872.94]  that is the
[3872.94 --> 3873.28]  gift of
[3873.28 --> 3873.64]  righteousness.
[3874.48 --> 3874.78]  And that
[3874.78 --> 3875.02]  is what
[3875.02 --> 3875.60]  it cost
[3875.60 --> 3876.18]  God to
[3876.18 --> 3876.50]  give us
[3876.50 --> 3877.00]  this gift.
[3877.72 --> 3877.84]  He
[3877.84 --> 3878.34]  redeemed
[3878.34 --> 3878.76]  us.
[3879.52 --> 3879.78]  He
[3879.78 --> 3880.28]  atoned
[3880.28 --> 3881.02]  for us.
[3881.72 --> 3882.32]  And that
[3882.32 --> 3882.58]  is how
[3882.58 --> 3883.36]  he established
[3883.36 --> 3884.24]  a relationship
[3884.24 --> 3884.98]  with us.
[3884.98 --> 3886.20]  that's
[3886.20 --> 3886.54]  how he
[3886.54 --> 3886.80]  can
[3886.80 --> 3887.50]  clothe
[3887.50 --> 3887.74]  us
[3887.74 --> 3888.24]  and robe
[3888.24 --> 3888.50]  us
[3888.50 --> 3888.94]  with his
[3888.94 --> 3889.34]  righteousness
[3889.34 --> 3890.64]  as a
[3890.64 --> 3890.90]  gift.
[3891.58 --> 3891.94]  So now,
[3892.08 --> 3893.24]  what does
[3893.24 --> 3893.62]  this mean
[3893.62 --> 3894.18]  for us?
[3894.44 --> 3894.68]  What does
[3894.68 --> 3894.94]  this mean
[3894.94 --> 3895.24]  for us
[3895.24 --> 3895.50]  today?
[3896.16 --> 3896.70]  There's a
[3896.70 --> 3897.10]  whole lot
[3897.10 --> 3897.40]  of things
[3897.40 --> 3897.74]  this means
[3897.74 --> 3898.28]  for us.
[3898.62 --> 3898.96]  And I'd
[3898.96 --> 3899.22]  love to
[3899.22 --> 3899.56]  spend a
[3899.56 --> 3899.90]  ton more
[3899.90 --> 3900.36]  time just
[3900.36 --> 3900.84]  going through
[3900.84 --> 3901.34]  a bunch
[3901.34 --> 3901.70]  of different
[3901.70 --> 3902.04]  things.
[3902.82 --> 3904.14]  But for
[3904.14 --> 3904.50]  today,
[3904.60 --> 3904.82]  let me
[3904.82 --> 3905.10]  mention
[3905.10 --> 3905.40]  two.
[3906.06 --> 3906.38]  Two
[3906.38 --> 3906.64]  things.
[3906.72 --> 3907.06]  First is
[3907.06 --> 3907.36]  this.
[3908.06 --> 3908.72]  We talked
[3908.72 --> 3909.36]  about redemption,
[3909.58 --> 3909.74]  right?
[3909.84 --> 3910.46]  So redemption,
[3910.74 --> 3911.46]  we are set
[3911.46 --> 3912.24]  free from
[3912.24 --> 3912.86]  our captivity
[3912.86 --> 3913.46]  to sin.
[3913.46 --> 3915.46]  But when
[3915.46 --> 3916.42]  God redeems
[3916.42 --> 3916.80]  us from
[3916.80 --> 3917.34]  slavery,
[3917.68 --> 3918.38]  when he
[3918.38 --> 3918.90]  purchases
[3918.90 --> 3919.64]  our freedom,
[3920.34 --> 3921.44]  the other
[3921.44 --> 3922.02]  side of
[3922.02 --> 3922.62]  the coin
[3922.62 --> 3923.46]  is that
[3923.46 --> 3923.86]  we now
[3923.86 --> 3924.44]  belong to
[3924.44 --> 3924.72]  God.
[3926.00 --> 3926.52]  Right?
[3926.68 --> 3927.14]  So he
[3927.14 --> 3928.46]  purchased us
[3928.46 --> 3929.30]  to be
[3929.30 --> 3929.76]  his very
[3929.76 --> 3930.08]  own.
[3930.76 --> 3931.14]  And that's
[3931.14 --> 3931.48]  what our
[3931.48 --> 3931.84]  redemption
[3931.84 --> 3932.26]  is all
[3932.26 --> 3932.56]  about,
[3932.68 --> 3932.80]  right?
[3932.82 --> 3933.10]  It's no
[3933.10 --> 3933.72]  longer to
[3933.72 --> 3934.28]  be our
[3934.28 --> 3934.72]  own,
[3934.80 --> 3935.34]  but to
[3935.34 --> 3936.14]  belong,
[3936.30 --> 3937.14]  body and
[3937.14 --> 3937.66]  soul and
[3937.66 --> 3938.04]  life and
[3938.04 --> 3938.44]  in death,
[3938.60 --> 3939.24]  to our
[3939.24 --> 3939.90]  faithful Savior,
[3940.04 --> 3940.68]  Jesus Christ.
[3940.68 --> 3940.80]  Christ.
[3942.24 --> 3942.50]  And so
[3942.50 --> 3942.92]  to be
[3942.92 --> 3943.50]  redeemed
[3943.50 --> 3944.14]  from our
[3944.14 --> 3944.92]  captivity to
[3944.92 --> 3945.74]  sin is
[3945.74 --> 3946.12]  vital,
[3946.24 --> 3946.44]  but it's
[3946.44 --> 3947.04]  only half
[3947.04 --> 3947.36]  of it.
[3947.64 --> 3947.86]  There's
[3947.86 --> 3948.46]  always a
[3948.46 --> 3948.84]  redemption
[3948.84 --> 3949.90]  from and
[3949.90 --> 3950.40]  a redemption
[3950.40 --> 3951.40]  to,
[3951.82 --> 3952.38]  a negative
[3952.38 --> 3952.70]  and a
[3952.70 --> 3953.04]  positive.
[3954.04 --> 3955.04]  Because to
[3955.04 --> 3955.56]  be set
[3955.56 --> 3956.48]  free from
[3956.48 --> 3957.08]  sin is
[3957.08 --> 3957.60]  not the
[3957.60 --> 3958.42]  same as
[3958.42 --> 3958.94]  to be
[3958.94 --> 3959.88]  welcomed.
[3961.16 --> 3962.02]  But when
[3962.02 --> 3962.98]  Jesus redeems
[3962.98 --> 3963.40]  us,
[3963.98 --> 3964.38]  he does
[3964.38 --> 3964.76]  both.
[3965.46 --> 3966.06]  We're
[3966.06 --> 3966.52]  redeemed
[3966.52 --> 3967.40]  from slavery
[3967.40 --> 3967.92]  to sin,
[3968.02 --> 3968.62]  and we are
[3968.62 --> 3969.76]  welcomed into
[3969.76 --> 3970.46]  God's
[3970.46 --> 3971.14]  family
[3971.14 --> 3971.82]  forever.
[3972.60 --> 3972.96]  Right?
[3973.02 --> 3973.58]  No longer
[3973.58 --> 3974.40]  as slaves,
[3974.92 --> 3975.32]  but as
[3975.32 --> 3975.94]  sons and
[3975.94 --> 3977.42]  daughters who
[3977.42 --> 3977.98]  belong to
[3977.98 --> 3978.18]  him.
[3979.20 --> 3979.88]  So he
[3979.88 --> 3980.34]  gives us
[3980.34 --> 3980.66]  this gift
[3980.66 --> 3981.16]  of righteousness
[3981.16 --> 3981.74]  and then he
[3981.74 --> 3982.54]  establishes a
[3982.54 --> 3983.40]  relationship with
[3983.40 --> 3984.40]  us so that
[3984.40 --> 3985.48]  we belong to
[3985.48 --> 3986.46]  him forever.
[3987.24 --> 3987.54]  And friends,
[3987.58 --> 3988.22]  that is amazing.
[3989.32 --> 3989.72]  He doesn't
[3989.72 --> 3990.30]  just set us
[3990.30 --> 3990.54]  free,
[3990.72 --> 3991.72]  he brings us
[3991.72 --> 3992.24]  into his
[3992.24 --> 3992.60]  family.
[3995.14 --> 3995.94]  The second
[3995.94 --> 3996.40]  thing this
[3996.40 --> 3996.98]  means for us
[3996.98 --> 3997.48]  is this.
[3997.82 --> 3998.56]  When we look
[3998.56 --> 3998.82]  at this
[3998.82 --> 3999.16]  passage,
[3999.16 --> 3999.62]  like when
[3999.62 --> 3999.90]  we just
[3999.90 --> 4000.14]  kind of
[4000.14 --> 4000.76]  step back
[4000.76 --> 4000.96]  and we
[4000.96 --> 4001.56]  look at
[4001.56 --> 4002.86]  verses 21
[4002.86 --> 4003.74]  to 26
[4003.74 --> 4004.98]  and consider
[4004.98 --> 4005.40]  the big
[4005.40 --> 4005.82]  picture,
[4007.06 --> 4007.82]  how many
[4007.82 --> 4008.86]  references are
[4008.86 --> 4010.16]  there to
[4010.16 --> 4010.60]  God?
[4011.90 --> 4012.34]  Right?
[4012.36 --> 4012.66]  If you just
[4012.66 --> 4013.06]  kind of look
[4013.06 --> 4013.36]  through the
[4013.36 --> 4013.78]  passages,
[4014.14 --> 4014.68]  go verse
[4014.68 --> 4015.16]  by verse
[4015.16 --> 4015.62]  and count
[4015.62 --> 4016.00]  them,
[4016.28 --> 4016.74]  there are
[4016.74 --> 4017.64]  roughly 10
[4017.64 --> 4018.82]  references to
[4018.82 --> 4019.94]  God or to
[4019.94 --> 4020.88]  Jesus Christ or
[4020.88 --> 4021.38]  to Christ's
[4021.38 --> 4021.94]  blood or
[4021.94 --> 4022.54]  however you
[4022.54 --> 4023.00]  want to call
[4023.00 --> 4023.16]  it.
[4024.72 --> 4025.16]  And then
[4025.16 --> 4025.92]  how many
[4025.92 --> 4026.80]  references to
[4026.80 --> 4027.26]  us?
[4027.26 --> 4029.66]  it's in
[4029.66 --> 4030.74]  those words
[4030.74 --> 4031.56]  in verse
[4031.56 --> 4032.30]  25,
[4033.04 --> 4033.74]  to be
[4033.74 --> 4034.56]  received by
[4034.56 --> 4034.96]  faith.
[4036.54 --> 4037.54]  What we
[4037.54 --> 4038.94]  do is
[4038.94 --> 4039.42]  receive.
[4040.48 --> 4040.62]  Right?
[4040.70 --> 4041.40]  And so it
[4041.40 --> 4041.82]  goes through
[4041.82 --> 4042.50]  the righteousness
[4042.50 --> 4043.12]  of God,
[4043.22 --> 4044.08]  the glory of
[4044.08 --> 4044.32]  God,
[4044.40 --> 4045.10]  the grace of
[4045.10 --> 4045.68]  God through
[4045.68 --> 4046.14]  Christ,
[4046.42 --> 4047.06]  in Christ,
[4047.30 --> 4047.80]  because of
[4047.80 --> 4048.22]  Christ,
[4048.22 --> 4050.54]  to be received
[4050.54 --> 4051.02]  by faith.
[4051.02 --> 4052.50]  that's what
[4052.50 --> 4052.82]  we do.
[4053.44 --> 4054.26]  You receive
[4054.26 --> 4054.88]  it by faith.
[4055.00 --> 4055.42]  You do
[4055.42 --> 4056.10]  absolutely
[4056.10 --> 4057.40]  nothing to
[4057.40 --> 4058.00]  get this
[4058.00 --> 4058.36]  gift of
[4058.36 --> 4058.74]  righteousness
[4058.74 --> 4060.08]  except to
[4060.08 --> 4060.86]  just receive
[4060.86 --> 4061.06]  it.
[4061.66 --> 4062.00]  It's a
[4062.00 --> 4062.32]  gift.
[4063.04 --> 4063.52]  And the
[4063.52 --> 4063.92]  gift that
[4063.92 --> 4064.42]  God gives
[4064.42 --> 4065.40]  us ultimately
[4065.40 --> 4066.84]  is himself
[4066.84 --> 4068.28]  in the
[4068.28 --> 4068.72]  person of
[4068.72 --> 4069.42]  Jesus Christ
[4069.42 --> 4071.02]  so that he
[4071.02 --> 4071.70]  can bestow
[4071.70 --> 4072.60]  on us the
[4072.60 --> 4073.10]  gift of his
[4073.10 --> 4073.48]  righteousness.
[4074.64 --> 4075.46]  So friends,
[4075.54 --> 4076.04]  if you have
[4076.04 --> 4076.66]  not received
[4076.66 --> 4077.44]  that gift yet
[4077.44 --> 4077.98]  this morning,
[4078.42 --> 4079.28]  the invitation
[4079.28 --> 4081.12]  for you is
[4081.12 --> 4081.64]  to receive
[4081.64 --> 4083.08]  it, to be
[4083.08 --> 4084.28]  welcomed into
[4084.28 --> 4084.78]  his family,
[4084.86 --> 4085.44]  to be set
[4085.44 --> 4086.32]  free from
[4086.32 --> 4087.20]  sin, to
[4087.20 --> 4087.68]  know the
[4087.68 --> 4088.04]  love of
[4088.04 --> 4088.60]  God for
[4088.60 --> 4088.82]  you.
[4089.44 --> 4090.08]  Let's pray.
[4093.18 --> 4093.84]  Oh Lord,
[4093.90 --> 4094.50]  we thank you
[4094.50 --> 4095.16]  and we praise
[4095.16 --> 4095.94]  you that we
[4095.94 --> 4096.88]  who are yet
[4096.88 --> 4098.74]  sinners receive
[4098.74 --> 4099.42]  the gift of
[4099.42 --> 4101.02]  righteousness that
[4101.02 --> 4101.98]  comes from
[4101.98 --> 4103.80]  God for us.
[4104.64 --> 4105.26]  And so Lord,
[4105.36 --> 4105.68]  would you
[4105.68 --> 4107.06]  imprint these
[4107.06 --> 4107.80]  words, would
[4107.80 --> 4108.36]  you imprint
[4108.36 --> 4109.24]  these truths
[4109.24 --> 4109.82]  on our
[4109.82 --> 4110.26]  hearts.
[4110.90 --> 4111.54]  Help us to
[4111.54 --> 4112.50]  be captivated
[4112.50 --> 4113.46]  not by sin
[4113.46 --> 4114.90]  but by you
[4114.90 --> 4115.42]  our Savior.
[4115.54 --> 4115.92]  Help us to
[4115.92 --> 4116.52]  look upon
[4116.52 --> 4117.20]  this gift
[4117.20 --> 4119.26]  and to
[4119.26 --> 4120.44]  have our
[4120.44 --> 4121.52]  hearts warmed
[4121.52 --> 4122.62]  by it.
[4123.02 --> 4123.50]  To be
[4123.50 --> 4124.38]  renewed in
[4124.38 --> 4124.92]  our walk
[4124.92 --> 4125.28]  with you
[4125.28 --> 4125.58]  and our

[4127.92 --> 4128.62]  the beauty
[4128.62 --> 4129.04]  of what you
[4129.04 --> 4129.28]  have done
[4129.28 --> 4129.82]  for us.
[4130.34 --> 4130.88]  We pray in
[4130.88 --> 4131.44]  Jesus' name.
[4131.78 --> 4132.00]  Amen.
[4134.20 --> 4134.68]  Alright,

[4137.06 --> 4137.68]  we'll sing
[4137.68 --> 4138.06]  our song
[4138.06 --> 4138.56]  of response
[4138.56 --> 4139.02]  I am not
[4139.02 --> 4139.40]  my own.
[4143.40 --> 4143.86]  Thank you.
[4143.86 --> 4166.74]  This is my only cover in my life and in my life.
[4166.74 --> 4173.56]  And with love fully grateful for my safety and health, my health, my health, my health,
[4173.86 --> 4178.86]  even when I struggle to believe.
[4181.06 --> 4185.52]  With your precious blood you set me free.
[4187.66 --> 4194.74]  I am on my own, my beloved.
[4194.74 --> 4201.74]  I am on my own, my soul, in my life.
[4201.74 --> 4209.04]  I am in death to you, Lord.
[4209.54 --> 4212.70]  Where is my love?
[4212.70 --> 4219.70]  I hope we've done my life in such a way that we have to.
[4219.70 --> 4226.70]  Not a heck and far from me unless you will be too.
[4226.70 --> 4233.12]  Even when I'm lost in aspiration.
[4234.50 --> 4239.92]  I brought this life together for my salvation.
[4239.92 --> 4244.92]  I am on my own.
[4244.92 --> 4246.92]  I am on my own.
[4246.92 --> 4251.92]  I feel all my need and soul.
[4251.92 --> 4257.92]  In my life and in death.
[4257.92 --> 4262.50]  In death to you, Lord.
[4262.50 --> 4267.26]  I am on my own.
[4267.26 --> 4272.90]  For us by your Holy Spirit with you are sure
[4272.90 --> 4280.24]  Call me time, Lord life, and make me willing and ready
[4280.24 --> 4285.78]  Even when I can't see how it's through
[4285.78 --> 4292.54]  From now on to always live for you
[4292.54 --> 4305.66]  I am not my own, but below my soul
[4305.66 --> 4319.30]  In my life and in men to you, Lord, bless my Lord
[4319.30 --> 4345.42]  In my life and in men to you, Lord, bless my Lord
[4345.42 --> 4350.42]  In my life and in men to you, Lord, bless my Lord

[4352.42 --> 4364.84]  So we continue to worship the Lord with the giving of our tithes and offerings
[4364.84 --> 4370.60]  And we know that every good and perfect gift comes from God above the Father of lights
[4370.60 --> 4375.68]  And so we open our hearts and our hands to give ourselves to God's kingdom work

[4390.68 --> 4394.02]  So as the deacons come forward to collect the morning offering
[4394.02 --> 4395.70]  We can look at the slideshow
