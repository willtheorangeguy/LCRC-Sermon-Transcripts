[0.00 → 2.00] Music
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 66.40] Oh, test, test, test, test.
[67.90 → 69.18] Testing, testing, testing.
[70.02 → 70.78] I can't, I don't know.
[75.84 → 76.32] Whatever.
[79.20 → 79.64] Okay.
[90.00 → 92.00] Okay.
[120.00 → 122.00] Okay.
[150.00 → 152.00] Okay.
[180.00 → 182.00] Okay.
[210.00 → 212.00] Okay.
[240.00 → 242.00] Okay.
[270.00 → 272.00] Okay.
[300.00 → 320.36] Well, good morning, everyone.
[321.28 → 323.52] It's nice to see you and be with you today.
[323.66 → 324.28] Happy Thanksgiving.
[325.78 → 326.44] Thank you.
[326.44 → 330.36] And so my name is Jason True.
[330.44 → 331.56] I'm one of the pastors here.
[331.90 → 337.94] And it is my joy to welcome you to worship today on this Lord's Day.
[339.38 → 344.88] And if you are new, you're visiting maybe from out of town, visiting family for Thanksgiving.
[344.88 → 350.06] We are so glad that you are here with us, and we hope that you will feel welcome.
[351.64 → 354.82] Just a couple of announcements as we begin.
[354.82 → 363.48] And so you can see that there are already some items that have been brought forward for our
[363.48 → 367.16] Thanksgiving donation to the South Delta Food Bank.
[367.32 → 367.92] And that's great.
[367.92 → 374.78] If you haven't brought your things forward already, there's going to be an opportunity for you to do that during our greeting time.
[374.90 → 380.44] So once when everyone's up and milling about, feel free to bring up some stuff if you haven't already.
[380.62 → 384.02] I know people have also dropped food over by the donation bags.
[384.02 → 387.32] But wherever it is left, we will find it and gather it.
[389.28 → 390.76] And so here's another thing.
[390.92 → 399.04] Because it's Thanksgiving, I was thinking, what's a way that we can kind of express, each of us, our own things that we are thankful for?
[399.04 → 409.98] So what I want to do is when we have the greeting time, I would like you to share something that you're thankful for with those around you.
[410.54 → 413.96] Maybe think about trying to share with three different people.
[414.32 → 415.84] So you might have to get up and mill about.
[416.68 → 418.74] And so I'm telling you now so you can be thinking.
[419.84 → 420.08] Okay?
[420.30 → 424.36] So think of something that you want to share that you're thankful for.
[424.36 → 427.54] And try to be, you know, don't just say food, right?
[427.70 → 428.94] I know you're not high school kids.
[428.98 → 429.96] That's what high school kids would say.
[430.04 → 430.68] What are you thankful for?
[430.78 → 431.10] Sleep?
[431.74 → 432.10] Food?
[432.36 → 432.86] Something like that.
[432.88 → 437.00] But try to be, you know, a little bit more specific, something concrete that you're thankful for.
[437.16 → 440.58] And we'll have a chance to share that with each other.
[442.30 → 449.36] The other big one is that next week is our 75th year anniversary celebration.
[450.10 → 454.22] God has been gracious to us for 75 years as a congregation.
[454.96 → 457.20] And next weekend we are going to celebrate that.
[457.32 → 460.70] And we are going to mark this anniversary of God's faithfulness.
[461.04 → 463.88] So next Saturday there are events that are happening.
[464.08 → 466.28] You can look in your bulletin to see those.
[466.64 → 470.18] And then a special Sunday worship next week.
[471.22 → 475.90] So with that, let's come before the Lord in worship.
[475.90 → 480.28] And God, as he does each week, he gathers his people.
[481.90 → 483.84] And he calls us to worship him.
[484.36 → 489.68] And so we're going to hear and then respond to the call to worship today from Psalm 100.
[490.20 → 492.38] And we'll say this as a call and response.
[492.38 → 498.52] Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[499.22 → 501.00] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[501.56 → 503.74] Come before him with joyful songs.
[504.82 → 506.96] Know that the Lord is God.
[507.42 → 510.72] It is he who made us, and we are his.
[510.72 → 514.82] We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[515.56 → 520.28] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[520.66 → 523.28] Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[524.40 → 528.24] For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[528.90 → 532.76] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[533.72 → 537.12] Would you join me in a prayer of adoration to our God?
[537.12 → 538.14] Let's pray together.
[539.68 → 543.60] Almighty God, we worship you this morning and we thank you.
[544.44 → 546.24] You are the Lord of heaven and earth.
[546.42 → 550.12] Lord, in you, we live, and we move, and we have our being.
[551.00 → 554.72] Lord, you make the sun to rise on the evil and on the good.
[555.46 → 558.16] You send rain on the just and on the unjust.
[559.54 → 562.82] And gracious God, your heart abounds with goodness.
[562.82 → 566.08] Your hands pour out abundance.
[567.00 → 575.68] And so, Lord, we praise you for the beauty of your creation, for the autumn, for the seasons of seed time and harvest.
[576.50 → 580.38] Lord, and we thank you as we read in Psalm 100 that you are our good shepherd.
[580.84 → 582.30] That you are always with us.
[582.40 → 583.66] That you care for us.
[584.84 → 589.64] Thank you, Lord, for welcoming us into this time of worship this morning.
[590.34 → 592.46] Lord, thank you for speaking to us through your word.
[592.46 → 597.18] Thank you, Lord, for the privilege that we can come before you in prayer.
[598.54 → 602.14] So, Lord, by your Holy Spirit, would you help us to give you praise and thanks.
[602.64 → 607.84] Would you enable us to lift our hearts to you in worship and in great Thanksgiving this morning.
[608.86 → 616.48] And so, Lord, we join our hearts, and we join our voices with all of your creation in worshipping you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[616.86 → 619.32] We pray in Christ's name and for his sake.
[619.90 → 620.24] Amen.
[620.24 → 620.36] Amen.
[621.26 → 622.78] So, first, we're going to stand.
[622.92 → 625.64] We're going to sing together for the beauty of the earth.
[626.12 → 628.70] Then, after that first song, we'll have our time of greeting.
[628.70 → 639.54] Good morning.
[639.54 → 662.28] For the beauty of the earth, for the glory of the skies,
[662.28 → 672.12] For the love which from our birth, all around and around us lies,
[672.64 → 682.76] Christ our Lord to you, we raise, this is our hymn of grateful praise.
[682.76 → 693.56] For the wonder of each hour, of the day and of the night,
[694.06 → 703.00] Hill and veiled tree of flower, sun and moon and stars of light,
[703.00 → 713.44] Christ our Lord to you, we raise, this is our hymn of grateful praise.
[714.86 → 724.34] For the joy of human life, brother, sister, parent, child,
[724.34 → 734.00] Let's all earth and close above, for all gentle thoughts and mild,
[734.58 → 744.74] Christ our Lord to you, we raise, this is our hymn of grateful praise.
[744.74 → 756.10] For your selfless gift divine, to the world so freely give,
[756.68 → 766.08] Be gentle, love, and desire, peace, honour, and joy in heaven.
[766.08 → 779.34] Christ our Lord to you, we raise, this is our hymn of grateful praise.
[784.22 → 789.68] God greets us this morning with these words from Colossians 3 verse 15.
[789.68 → 796.80] Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace,
[797.68 → 798.38] and be thankful.
[799.72 → 803.40] And so, as God is welcome to greet us, let's greet one another,
[803.56 → 807.88] and let us share what we are thankful for with one another.
[808.16 → 808.48] Go ahead.
[809.18 → 811.34] And bring forward any food donations as well.
[819.68 → 849.66] Thank you.
[849.68 → 879.66] Thank you.
[879.68 → 881.68] Thank you.
[881.68 → 886.68] Thank you.
[886.68 → 896.68] Thank you.
[896.68 → 900.68] Thank you.
[900.68 → 907.68] Thank you.
[907.68 → 909.68] Thank you.
[909.68 → 911.68] Thank you.
[911.68 → 915.68] Thank you.
[915.68 → 916.68] Thank you.
[916.68 → 922.68] Thank you.
[922.68 → 924.68] Thank you.
[924.68 → 932.68] Thank you.
[932.68 → 939.68] Thank you.
[939.68 → 941.68] Thank you.
[941.68 → 943.68] Thank you.
[943.68 → 945.68] Thank you.
[945.68 → 946.68] Thank you.
[946.68 → 947.68] Thank you.
[947.68 → 960.68] Thank you.
[960.68 → 961.68] Thank you.
[975.68 → 977.68] is ours today
[977.68 → 981.68] O
[981.68 → 982.74] with his
[982.74 → 984.68] mountains come
[985.28 → 986.68] the world
[987.60 → 990.68] be near us
[991.50 → 992.68] with
[992.68 → 994.68] other joyful
[994.68 → 997.04] hearts
[997.04 → 998.48] and blessings
[998.48 → 1002.68] to cheer us
[1003.16 → 1005.14] and keep
[1005.14 → 1006.84] us in his
[1006.84 → 1008.44] grace
[1008.44 → 1010.54] and all that
[1010.54 → 1011.14] sin
[1011.14 → 1012.14] remains
[1012.14 → 1015.14] and free
[1015.14 → 1016.98] us from all
[1016.98 → 1018.52] ills
[1018.52 → 1020.94] in this world
[1020.94 → 1022.28] and all
[1022.28 → 1024.06] days
[1024.06 → 1026.66] all
[1026.66 → 1028.56] praise and thanks
[1028.56 → 1030.60] to God
[1030.60 → 1032.42] as all
[1032.42 → 1033.58] becoming
[1033.58 → 1035.84] but
[1035.84 → 1037.84] a
[1037.84 → 1039.62] whoever
[1039.62 → 1040.38] may
[1040.38 → 1041.84] rest
[1041.84 → 1042.02] by
[1042.02 → 1042.76] a
[1042.76 → 1043.42] soul
[1043.42 → 1043.82] who
[1043.82 → 1045.18] will
[1045.18 → 1045.64] must
[1045.72 → 1046.04] be
[1046.04 → 1047.74] Oxford
[1047.74 → 1047.92] and
[1047.92 → 1049.66] coaches
[1049.66 → 1053.72] raise a
[1053.72 → 1055.84] Mark
[1055.84 → 1059.02] of the dream
[1059.02 → 1074.94] And the slowly
[1085.84 → 1115.82] Thank you.
[1115.84 → 1145.82] Thank you.
[1145.84 → 1147.84] Thank you.
[1175.84 → 1177.84] Thank you.
[1205.84 → 1207.84] Thank you.
[1235.84 → 1237.84] Thank you.
[1265.84 → 1267.84] Thank you.
[1295.84 → 1297.84] Thank you.
[1297.84 → 1299.84] Thank you.
[1299.84 → 1301.84] Thank you.
[1301.84 → 1306.96] So our first scripture reading this morning is from the Gospel of Matthew.
[1308.24 → 1312.46] I invite you to follow along in the Bible or to look on the screen.
[1312.46 → 1315.64] So this is Matthew chapter 6.
[1315.64 → 1330.82] So Matthew chapter 6, and I'll read for us verses 25 to 34.
[1330.82 → 1335.62] So Matthew 6, beginning in verse 25.
[1335.62 → 1346.88] Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear.
[1347.86 → 1351.60] It's not life more than food and the body more than clothes.
[1352.50 → 1353.84] Look at the birds of the air.
[1353.84 → 1357.24] They do not sow or reap or store away in barns.
[1358.02 → 1361.98] And yet, your heavenly Father feeds them.
[1363.06 → 1365.16] Are you not much more valuable than they?
[1366.12 → 1372.14] Can any one of you, by worrying, add a single hour to your life?
[1372.14 → 1376.08] And why do you worry about clothes?
[1376.70 → 1378.70] See how the flowers of the field grow.
[1379.28 → 1380.92] They do not labour or spin.
[1381.58 → 1388.16] Yet, I tell you, that not even Solomon in all of his splendour was dressed like one of these.
[1389.04 → 1395.70] If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire,
[1396.30 → 1400.56] will he not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
[1400.56 → 1404.12] So do not worry, saying, what shall we eat?
[1404.42 → 1405.80] Or what shall we drink?
[1406.34 → 1407.60] Or what shall we wear?
[1408.12 → 1412.78] For the pagans run after these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[1413.60 → 1420.52] But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
[1421.26 → 1425.60] Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[1425.92 → 1430.00] Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[1430.56 → 1431.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[1432.52 → 1433.72] Thanks be to God.
[1433.72 → 1443.02] So, you know, we've given thanks to God.
[1443.12 → 1445.02] We've shared some of our thanksgivings.
[1445.16 → 1446.00] We've praised him.
[1446.00 → 1458.92] And even in the midst of that, our praise or thanksgiving, we also pause to confess the ways that we actually so often lose sight of all that God has done for us.
[1458.96 → 1466.56] We are just the recipients of God's grace, his mercy, his goodness that overflows from his throne.
[1466.56 → 1471.74] And we do nothing for it, but it all comes from his hands.
[1471.80 → 1482.16] And yet, so often, we lose sight of the giver of all these gifts, even as we're thankful for them, for what God gives us.
[1482.16 → 1492.04] So let's join in a confession, and let's acknowledge that before him, so that our hearts could then be turned toward our God, who does give us all things.
[1492.12 → 1492.98] So let's pray together.
[1492.98 → 1511.08] Oh, Lord, we confess that in the midst of our worries, and in the midst of our self-sufficiency, and in the midst of our abundance, that we forget you, the one from whom all blessings flow.
[1512.00 → 1515.70] We forget to love you as you first loved us.
[1515.70 → 1524.22] We forget to help our neighbours, even though you have made us not only neighbours, but friends and children.
[1525.60 → 1529.72] We forget to thank you for your many gifts and blessings to us.
[1530.54 → 1531.86] So, Lord, would you forgive us?
[1532.76 → 1542.42] And, Lord, by your grace, would you give us renewed hearts to love you first, and strengthened hands to serve you above ourselves.
[1542.42 → 1551.22] And, Lord, would you give us tongues that are quick to worship you, to pray for our needs, and to offer you our thanksgiving.
[1551.90 → 1563.10] Lord, help us live this day and this week and always so that our whole lives would be overflowing with gratitude and Thanksgiving to you.
[1563.48 → 1566.80] We pray in the name of Jesus, our Saviour and our Redeemer.
[1567.46 → 1567.84] Amen.
[1567.84 → 1567.92] Amen.
[1569.52 → 1581.50] So, to those who have confessed their sins sincerely before God in faith, God is faithful, and he is just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness.
[1582.02 → 1587.82] So, here are these words of assurance that come from Psalm 65, verses 3 and 4.
[1588.06 → 1588.62] It says,
[1588.62 → 1595.06] When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
[1595.06 → 1600.20] Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts.
[1600.36 → 1604.58] We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
[1605.88 → 1606.70] Thanks be to God.
[1607.16 → 1610.86] Let's stand and let's sing another song together, a song of Thanksgiving.
[1610.86 → 1633.86] I'm forgiven, because you were forsaken.
[1633.86 → 1641.04] I'm forgiven.
[1641.04 → 1646.38] I'm far Andean the right to live in your because wake up of your house, of your guy.
[1646.46 → 1646.74] I am forgiven.
[1646.74 → 1647.42] I'm forgiven.
[1647.42 → 1650.68] I am forgiven.
[1650.68 → 1653.82] I am forgiven.
[1653.82 → 1663.30] I am forgiven.
[1663.30 → 1667.30] You were forsaken
[1667.30 → 1671.30] Nine years in time
[1671.30 → 1675.30] You were condemned
[1675.30 → 1678.30] I'm alive and mine
[1678.30 → 1682.30] Your spirit is within me
[1682.30 → 1685.30] Your heart is still high
[1685.30 → 1689.30] And it grows again
[1689.30 → 1693.30] Amazing love
[1693.30 → 1697.30] How can I be
[1697.30 → 1701.30] And you my King
[1701.30 → 1703.30] Would die for me
[1703.30 → 1709.30] Amazing love
[1709.30 → 1711.30] How can I be
[1711.30 → 1713.30] And you my King
[1713.30 → 1715.30] Would die for me
[1715.30 → 1717.30] Amazing love
[1717.30 → 1719.30] How can I be
[1719.30 → 1721.30] And you my King
[1721.30 → 1723.30] Would die for me
[1723.30 → 1725.30] Amazing love
[1725.30 → 1727.30] How can I be
[1727.30 → 1729.30] And you my King
[1729.30 → 1731.30] Would die for me
[1731.30 → 1733.30] Amazing love
[1733.30 → 1735.30] How can I be
[1735.30 → 1737.30] Amazing love
[1737.30 → 1739.30] I know I wish to do
[1739.30 → 1741.30] It's my joy
[1741.30 → 1743.30] I know I wish to do
[1743.30 → 1745.30] It's my joy
[1745.30 → 1747.30] It's my joy
[1747.30 → 1749.30] To honour you
[1749.30 → 1753.30] In all I do
[1753.30 → 1755.30] I honour you
[1755.30 → 1757.30] I honour you
[1757.30 → 1759.30] I honour you
[1759.30 → 1765.30] You are my King
[1765.30 → 1767.30] You are my King
[1767.30 → 1769.30] You are my King
[1769.30 → 1773.30] You are my King
[1773.30 → 1777.30] Jesus you are my King
[1777.30 → 1783.30] Jesus you are my King
[1783.30 → 1785.30] Jesus you are my King
[1785.30 → 1790.30] Jesus you are my King
[1790.30 → 1793.30] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
[1793.30 → 1795.30] I'm forgiven
[1795.30 → 1797.30] I'm forgiven
[1797.30 → 1799.30] Because you were forsaken
[1799.30 → 1801.30] I'm accepted
[1801.30 → 1803.30] You were condemned
[1803.30 → 1805.30] I'm forgiven
[1805.30 → 1807.30] You were condemned
[1807.30 → 1809.30] I'm alive and well
[1809.30 → 1811.30] Your spirit is within me
[1811.30 → 1813.30] Your God's entire
[1813.30 → 1817.30] My God's entire
[1817.30 → 1819.30] And close His land
[1819.30 → 1821.30] Am within me
[1821.30 → 1825.30] Amazing love
[1825.30 → 1827.30] How can I be
[1827.30 → 1829.30] And you my King
[1829.30 → 1831.30] Would die for me
[1831.30 → 1833.30] And you my King
[1833.30 → 1835.30] Would die for me
[1835.30 → 1837.30] I know I'm hurting
[1837.30 → 1849.54] oh
[1849.54 → 1855.20] It's my joy to honour you
[1855.20 → 1858.68] And all I do
[1858.68 → 1862.92] I offer you
[1862.92 → 1866.94] Amen, you may be seated
[1866.94 → 1868.56] Amen
[1868.56 → 1881.30] So our children are now dismissed
[1881.30 → 1883.24] To go to their Sunday school classes
[1898.56 → 1913.40] Oh yes, I wasn't looking
[1913.40 → 1918.64] Our Chinese fellowship is also sent to have their sermon
[1918.64 → 1924.74] And so today is Thanksgiving Sunday
[1924.74 → 1929.06] And so we're going to take a look
[1929.06 → 1930.98] At something that Paul teaches us
[1930.98 → 1932.86] About giving thanks
[1932.86 → 1935.48] From the book of Philippians
[1935.48 → 1938.42] And so today we are in Philippians chapter 4
[1938.42 → 1941.28] Again, I invite you to open your Bible and follow along
[1941.28 → 1942.78] If you would like to in your pew Bible
[1942.78 → 1946.36] We'll also have the passage on the screen
[1946.36 → 1948.12] But we're in Philippians chapter 4
[1948.12 → 1950.40] And we'll be reading verses 4 to 7
[1950.40 → 1952.22] It's a short passage
[1952.22 → 1953.88] It's a familiar passage
[1953.88 → 1957.08] And it's a wonderful passage
[1957.08 → 1959.72] So Philippians chapter 4
[1959.72 → 1960.70] Beginning in verse 4
[1960.70 → 1963.60] Rejoice in the Lord always
[1963.60 → 1965.48] I will say it again
[1965.48 → 1966.78] Rejoice
[1966.78 → 1970.52] Let your gentleness be evident to all
[1970.52 → 1971.60] The Lord is near
[1971.60 → 1974.98] Do not be anxious about anything
[1974.98 → 1977.32] But in every situation
[1977.32 → 1978.62] By prayer and petition
[1978.62 → 1979.96] With thanksgiving
[1979.96 → 1982.12] Present your request to God
[1982.12 → 1983.48] And the peace of God
[1983.48 → 1985.18] Which transcends all understanding
[1985.18 → 1987.16] Will guard your hearts
[1987.16 → 1988.28] And your minds
[1988.28 → 1990.38] In Christ Jesus
[1990.38 → 1992.24] This is the word of the Lord
[1992.24 → 1992.90] Thank you
[1992.90 → 1995.08] And so let's pray
[1995.08 → 1996.46] And let's ask for God
[1996.46 → 1998.74] That he will be honoured
[1998.74 → 1999.86] In our hearts
[1999.86 → 2001.96] As we come before his word together
[2001.96 → 2002.78] Let's pray together
[2002.78 → 2005.76] Lord, we
[2005.76 → 2007.40] Thank you
[2007.40 → 2007.42] Thank you
[2007.42 → 2010.54] Your word is not
[2010.54 → 2013.56] Words of human wisdom
[2013.56 → 2014.62] But Lord
[2014.62 → 2016.20] Divine words
[2016.20 → 2018.10] Spoken for our good
[2018.10 → 2020.26] So that we could live our lives
[2020.26 → 2021.90] In you and for you
[2021.90 → 2024.20] Mature in the faith
[2024.20 → 2025.54] So Lord
[2025.54 → 2026.60] We receive these words
[2026.60 → 2027.30] By faith
[2027.30 → 2028.56] And as we do
[2028.56 → 2029.64] So help us to grow
[2029.64 → 2030.86] To become more and more
[2030.86 → 2031.92] Like our Saviour
[2031.92 → 2033.46] Jesus Christ
[2033.46 → 2035.14] And it's in his name
[2035.14 → 2035.82] That we pray
[2035.82 → 2036.56] Amen
[2036.56 → 2040.06] Well, you know
[2040.06 → 2041.24] Music, of course
[2041.24 → 2042.74] Has a way of
[2042.74 → 2044.02] Capturing
[2044.02 → 2046.26] Our cultural mood
[2046.26 → 2047.06] Giving expression
[2047.06 → 2048.86] To what people are
[2048.86 → 2049.78] Feeling and thinking
[2049.78 → 2053.44] And so in the year 1989
[2053.44 → 2055.86] Right back in the glory days
[2055.86 → 2059.42] The song of the year
[2059.42 → 2060.92] At the Grammy Awards
[2060.92 → 2062.20] Was
[2062.20 → 2063.12] Anybody?
[2064.66 → 2065.28] Of course you didn't
[2065.28 → 2065.46] Yeah
[2065.46 → 2067.06] 1989
[2067.06 → 2068.06] The song of the year
[2068.06 → 2069.08] At the Grammys was
[2069.08 → 2070.18] Don't worry
[2070.18 → 2071.20] Be happy
[2071.20 → 2073.38] A reggae classic
[2073.38 → 2074.94] So I guess
[2074.94 → 2075.66] Most of you
[2075.66 → 2077.06] Know that song
[2077.06 → 2077.86] Or at least
[2077.86 → 2078.82] If you heard it on the radio
[2078.82 → 2079.38] You know
[2079.38 → 2080.36] You would recognize it
[2080.36 → 2082.34] And you can see
[2082.34 → 2083.26] Why it's so popular
[2083.26 → 2084.68] The music is catchy
[2084.68 → 2085.62] Actually it turns out
[2085.62 → 2086.46] There's no music at all
[2086.46 → 2087.54] It's actually all a cappella
[2087.54 → 2088.92] So that's interesting
[2088.92 → 2090.12] But it's a catchy
[2090.12 → 2091.38] What's the word?
[2091.48 → 2091.78] Melody?
[2092.40 → 2092.68] Tune?
[2093.00 → 2093.22] Okay
[2093.22 → 2095.32] The words are simple
[2095.32 → 2096.94] So it's easy to sing along
[2096.94 → 2097.76] And
[2097.76 → 2099.86] Because nobody wants to worry
[2099.86 → 2100.58] Right?
[2100.66 → 2101.56] That's why it's so popular
[2101.56 → 2104.88] But we all do
[2104.88 → 2106.08] Worry
[2106.08 → 2107.54] All the time
[2107.54 → 2108.80] Right?
[2108.80 → 2110.78] We worry about our work
[2110.78 → 2112.50] Our family
[2112.50 → 2114.08] Our relationships
[2114.08 → 2116.50] The future
[2116.50 → 2117.88] Money
[2117.88 → 2119.42] Lots of things
[2119.42 → 2120.14] You know
[2120.14 → 2121.26] We actually worry about
[2121.26 → 2122.02] Quite a lot
[2122.02 → 2123.58] About a lot of things
[2123.58 → 2123.94] And
[2123.94 → 2125.48] We wish we could simply
[2125.48 → 2126.62] Choose to be happy
[2126.62 → 2127.86] As if we can like
[2127.86 → 2128.54] Flip a switch
[2128.54 → 2130.74] But happiness
[2130.74 → 2132.28] Seems so elusive
[2132.28 → 2133.76] And anxiety
[2133.76 → 2134.54] Today
[2134.54 → 2136.86] Is so pervasive
[2136.86 → 2138.30] You know
[2138.30 → 2139.10] And we like to think
[2139.10 → 2140.14] That we are progressive
[2140.14 → 2141.10] Right?
[2141.16 → 2141.80] We like to think
[2141.80 → 2143.40] We are progressing
[2143.40 → 2145.58] That tomorrow's world
[2145.58 → 2146.58] Will be better
[2146.58 → 2148.36] Than today's
[2148.36 → 2149.12] You know
[2149.12 → 2150.16] But when we consider
[2150.16 → 2151.22] In our world today
[2151.22 → 2153.02] The increasing anxiety
[2153.02 → 2155.40] It does not feel like
[2155.40 → 2156.74] The secular vision
[2156.74 → 2157.54] Of progression
[2157.54 → 2158.96] Is actually leading
[2158.96 → 2159.72] To a better life
[2159.72 → 2160.14] For people
[2160.14 → 2161.04] Right?
[2161.08 → 2161.98] We live in
[2161.98 → 2162.88] What has been
[2162.88 → 2163.94] Characterized as
[2163.94 → 2165.70] An anxious age
[2165.70 → 2167.80] But it's
[2167.80 → 2168.26] Friends
[2168.26 → 2169.30] It's into this
[2169.30 → 2170.76] World of worry
[2170.76 → 2172.42] That Jesus comes
[2172.42 → 2173.04] And he actually
[2173.04 → 2173.96] Offers us something
[2173.96 → 2174.98] So much better
[2174.98 → 2176.98] He wants to
[2176.98 → 2178.32] Actually take away
[2178.32 → 2179.48] Our worry
[2179.48 → 2180.28] Our fear
[2180.28 → 2181.20] Our anxiety
[2181.20 → 2183.64] And offer us peace
[2183.64 → 2184.90] The peace of God
[2184.90 → 2186.54] You know
[2186.54 → 2187.34] And think about
[2187.34 → 2187.70] Jesus
[2187.70 → 2188.10] Think about
[2188.10 → 2188.88] His ministry
[2188.88 → 2189.58] In the world
[2189.58 → 2190.48] What did Jesus
[2190.48 → 2191.94] Say to Martha?
[2192.58 → 2193.18] You remember
[2193.18 → 2194.30] He speaks to Martha
[2194.30 → 2195.20] And he says
[2195.20 → 2196.24] Martha
[2196.24 → 2197.20] Martha
[2197.20 → 2198.36] You are worried
[2198.36 → 2199.64] And upset
[2199.64 → 2201.98] About many things
[2201.98 → 2203.34] There is only
[2203.34 → 2204.20] One thing
[2204.20 → 2204.82] That is needed
[2204.82 → 2206.02] Right?
[2206.12 → 2206.88] And that is
[2206.88 → 2207.64] To learn
[2207.64 → 2208.70] From him
[2208.70 → 2209.40] To be
[2209.40 → 2210.44] With Jesus
[2210.44 → 2211.72] And so
[2211.72 → 2212.32] Jesus
[2212.32 → 2213.10] He offers
[2213.10 → 2214.36] Offers her
[2214.36 → 2215.36] His peace
[2215.36 → 2216.86] In a place
[2216.86 → 2217.72] Of her anxiety
[2217.72 → 2219.62] You remember
[2219.62 → 2220.18] The parable
[2220.18 → 2220.80] Of the sower
[2220.80 → 2221.40] Right?
[2221.52 → 2222.16] The sower
[2222.16 → 2223.40] Goes and scatters
[2223.40 → 2223.98] The seed
[2223.98 → 2225.18] Some seed
[2225.18 → 2226.06] Falls among
[2226.06 → 2226.92] Thorns
[2226.92 → 2228.40] And the thorns
[2228.40 → 2229.64] They choke the seed
[2229.64 → 2230.40] And prevent it
[2230.40 → 2230.92] From growing
[2230.92 → 2232.68] And the disciples
[2232.68 → 2233.04] Asked
[2233.04 → 2233.36] Well Jesus
[2233.36 → 2233.92] What does that
[2233.92 → 2234.30] Represent?
[2234.50 → 2235.14] And what's the answer?
[2235.46 → 2236.18] What do the thorns
[2236.18 → 2236.66] Represent?
[2237.68 → 2238.56] The worries
[2238.56 → 2239.74] Of the world
[2239.74 → 2242.34] And so
[2242.34 → 2243.62] What keeps people
[2243.62 → 2244.60] From receiving
[2244.60 → 2245.66] The word of God
[2245.66 → 2246.26] The gospel
[2246.26 → 2247.80] Of salvation
[2247.80 → 2248.72] Is worry
[2248.72 → 2250.74] Is anxiety
[2250.74 → 2252.44] And so
[2252.44 → 2253.30] What did Jesus
[2253.30 → 2254.20] Our saviour
[2254.20 → 2255.64] Teach to the crowds
[2255.64 → 2256.34] In the sermon
[2256.34 → 2256.78] On the mount
[2256.78 → 2257.66] That we read earlier?
[2257.98 → 2258.54] He says
[2258.54 → 2259.36] Do not worry
[2259.36 → 2261.32] Do not fear
[2261.32 → 2262.64] Do not be anxious
[2262.64 → 2263.90] And he doesn't
[2263.90 → 2264.74] Just simply say
[2264.74 → 2265.64] Do not be anxious
[2265.64 → 2266.54] And then just move along
[2266.54 → 2267.52] To the next command
[2267.52 → 2268.48] Right?
[2268.54 → 2269.68] He explains why
[2269.68 → 2271.18] You don't have to be anxious
[2271.18 → 2272.36] And it's because
[2272.36 → 2273.32] God cares for you
[2273.32 → 2274.30] Right?
[2274.36 → 2275.14] Because God cares
[2275.14 → 2275.78] For the lilies
[2275.78 → 2276.40] Of the field
[2276.40 → 2277.74] How much more
[2277.74 → 2279.90] Will he care for you
[2279.90 → 2281.70] Whom he values
[2281.70 → 2282.66] So much more highly
[2282.66 → 2285.76] And so
[2285.76 → 2286.20] You know
[2286.20 → 2287.48] Even for Christians
[2287.48 → 2288.40] Honestly
[2288.40 → 2291.10] Undue worry
[2291.10 → 2291.62] I mean
[2291.62 → 2292.32] Of course
[2292.32 → 2292.52] You know
[2292.52 → 2293.34] If we love something
[2293.34 → 2294.10] We care about something
[2294.10 → 2294.66] We're going to have
[2294.66 → 2295.74] Some concern for it
[2295.74 → 2297.36] But undue worry
[2297.36 → 2299.20] Undue anxiety
[2299.20 → 2300.54] Is a sin
[2300.54 → 2301.64] That can actually
[2301.64 → 2303.08] Be an obstacle to us
[2303.08 → 2304.50] An obstacle to us
[2304.50 → 2305.26] Following Jesus
[2305.26 → 2306.68] Seeking his kingdom
[2306.68 → 2309.04] And ultimately
[2309.04 → 2310.94] As maybe some of us
[2310.94 → 2311.78] Have experienced
[2311.78 → 2312.26] Worry
[2312.26 → 2313.40] Can actually
[2313.40 → 2315.02] Ruin a great
[2315.02 → 2316.26] Deal of our lives
[2316.26 → 2319.40] Now this passage
[2319.40 → 2320.02] Is not saying
[2320.02 → 2320.88] That if you suffer
[2320.88 → 2322.28] From anxiety
[2322.28 → 2322.96] Disorder
[2322.96 → 2323.88] That you shouldn't
[2323.88 → 2324.90] Pursue medical care
[2324.90 → 2326.16] Or counselling
[2326.16 → 2326.66] Right?
[2326.72 → 2327.32] Those things are
[2327.32 → 2328.14] Good and helpful
[2328.14 → 2328.80] That's not what
[2328.80 → 2329.44] He's talking about
[2329.44 → 2330.90] But Paul is writing
[2330.90 → 2331.72] To Christians
[2331.72 → 2332.48] Who are
[2332.48 → 2333.78] Worrying
[2333.78 → 2335.50] He's actually
[2335.50 → 2336.32] He's writing to
[2336.32 → 2337.50] This church in Philippi
[2337.50 → 2340.56] This lovely congregation
[2340.56 → 2341.70] In the first century
[2341.70 → 2342.54] Roman world
[2342.54 → 2343.62] Who are
[2343.62 → 2344.28] A gathering
[2344.28 → 2345.30] Of new believers
[2345.30 → 2346.40] Men, women, and children
[2346.40 → 2347.60] Living their lives
[2347.60 → 2348.08] For Jesus
[2348.08 → 2348.86] In the world
[2348.86 → 2351.70] Who are afraid
[2351.70 → 2353.76] And they are discouraged
[2353.76 → 2355.90] And they are disheartened
[2355.90 → 2357.18] Now, so
[2357.18 → 2358.18] What's the context?
[2358.30 → 2358.96] Why are
[2358.96 → 2359.90] Why is this church
[2359.90 → 2361.40] So worried?
[2362.02 → 2363.46] And one reason is
[2363.46 → 2364.86] Because persecution
[2364.86 → 2365.52] Was happening
[2365.52 → 2367.00] Persecution against Christians
[2367.00 → 2369.14] So they have real concern
[2369.14 → 2371.10] For people that they love
[2371.10 → 2371.80] Who are facing
[2371.80 → 2373.80] That trauma
[2373.80 → 2375.30] Persecution
[2375.30 → 2378.14] But not only
[2378.14 → 2379.08] Do they have to worry
[2379.08 → 2379.74] About persecution
[2379.74 → 2380.48] From the outside
[2380.48 → 2382.20] But inside the church
[2382.20 → 2383.96] There was conflict
[2383.96 → 2385.02] There was disagreement
[2385.02 → 2386.12] Going on
[2386.12 → 2387.06] I don't know
[2387.06 → 2388.06] If you can imagine it
[2388.06 → 2390.06] But back in that day
[2390.06 → 2390.78] And today
[2390.78 → 2391.48] Sometimes
[2391.48 → 2393.32] There is still disagreement
[2393.32 → 2394.10] And that was
[2394.10 → 2395.18] Causing a great deal
[2395.18 → 2395.76] Of anxiety
[2395.76 → 2396.58] In the church
[2396.58 → 2398.28] And so for this church
[2398.28 → 2398.92] In Philippi
[2398.92 → 2399.98] There are situations
[2399.98 → 2401.92] In which
[2401.92 → 2403.30] They have reasons
[2403.30 → 2404.14] To be anxious
[2404.14 → 2406.98] Now what about Paul?
[2407.08 → 2407.84] Like that's the church
[2407.84 → 2408.48] How about Paul?
[2408.58 → 2409.06] Where's Paul?
[2410.38 → 2411.20] He's in jail
[2411.20 → 2412.70] Paul is sitting
[2412.70 → 2413.62] In a jail cell
[2413.62 → 2414.72] In Rome
[2414.72 → 2415.82] A thousand kilometres
[2415.82 → 2417.22] Away from Philippi
[2417.22 → 2418.30] Facing torture
[2418.90 → 2419.56] And death
[2419.56 → 2422.12] Okay, so that's the situation
[2422.12 → 2423.52] Paul is writing
[2423.52 → 2424.42] From a jail cell
[2424.42 → 2425.58] To a church
[2425.58 → 2426.30] Facing troubles
[2427.00 → 2427.96] From without
[2427.96 → 2428.78] And from within
[2428.78 → 2430.22] And yet
[2430.22 → 2431.08] What is Paul saying
[2431.08 → 2431.68] In this passage?
[2431.68 → 2433.54] Do not
[2433.54 → 2434.58] Be anxious
[2434.58 → 2435.66] About
[2435.66 → 2437.10] Anything
[2437.10 → 2438.88] I mean
[2438.88 → 2439.88] Come on
[2439.88 → 2440.98] That is
[2440.98 → 2441.86] Incredible
[2441.86 → 2442.92] That he would say that
[2442.92 → 2443.92] Given everything
[2443.92 → 2445.38] That is going on
[2445.38 → 2445.98] In their lives
[2445.98 → 2446.92] Don't be anxious
[2446.92 → 2447.68] About anything
[2447.68 → 2449.72] And so our text
[2449.72 → 2450.12] Is about
[2450.12 → 2451.20] Not being anxious
[2451.20 → 2452.06] Like the world
[2452.06 → 2452.88] Around us
[2452.88 → 2453.94] But instead
[2453.94 → 2454.86] Knowing the peace
[2454.86 → 2455.24] Of God
[2455.24 → 2456.18] Which can transcend
[2456.18 → 2457.14] Our understanding
[2457.14 → 2458.62] And that will guard
[2458.62 → 2459.90] Our hearts and minds
[2459.90 → 2461.38] No matter what
[2461.38 → 2462.86] Situations we face
[2462.86 → 2464.60] And because it's
[2464.60 → 2464.98] Thanksgiving
[2464.98 → 2466.82] What I want to do
[2466.82 → 2467.50] Is consider
[2467.50 → 2468.72] Three reasons
[2468.72 → 2469.38] For gratitude
[2469.38 → 2470.52] That come from
[2470.52 → 2471.40] Our pastors this morning
[2471.40 → 2471.64] Right?
[2471.74 → 2472.50] Three reasons
[2472.50 → 2473.14] For gratitude
[2473.14 → 2474.84] That are actually
[2474.84 → 2475.80] The antidote
[2475.80 → 2476.52] To anxiety
[2476.52 → 2478.24] How can we not
[2478.24 → 2478.94] Be anxious
[2478.94 → 2479.72] About anything?
[2480.38 → 2481.38] Well there are three things
[2481.38 → 2482.42] That we can be thankful for
[2482.42 → 2484.50] And those three things
[2484.50 → 2484.84] Are
[2484.84 → 2486.38] The presence of the Lord
[2486.38 → 2488.24] The privilege of prayer
[2488.24 → 2489.90] And the peace of God
[2489.90 → 2491.40] So that's where we're going
[2491.40 → 2491.90] This morning
[2491.90 → 2492.78] Three reasons
[2492.78 → 2494.50] To give thanks
[2494.50 → 2496.22] As an antidote
[2496.22 → 2497.34] To anxiety
[2497.34 → 2497.82] Okay?
[2497.90 → 2498.66] So we're just going to look
[2498.66 → 2499.56] At each one of these
[2499.56 → 2500.56] You know
[2500.56 → 2501.04] Briefly
[2501.04 → 2502.14] First is
[2502.14 → 2502.84] The presence
[2502.84 → 2503.76] Of the Lord
[2503.76 → 2505.92] We give thanks
[2505.92 → 2506.40] For the presence
[2506.40 → 2506.82] Of the Lord
[2506.82 → 2508.08] And so look with me
[2508.08 → 2509.60] At our passage
[2509.60 → 2510.68] And beginning again
[2510.68 → 2511.28] In verse 4
[2511.28 → 2512.38] Verses 4 and 5
[2512.38 → 2513.98] Paul says
[2513.98 → 2515.54] Rejoice
[2515.54 → 2516.90] In the Lord always
[2516.90 → 2518.64] I will say it again
[2518.64 → 2520.22] Rejoice
[2520.22 → 2521.22] Let your gentleness
[2521.22 → 2522.82] Be evident to all
[2522.82 → 2523.74] And then note this
[2523.74 → 2525.06] The Lord
[2525.06 → 2526.36] Is near
[2526.36 → 2528.68] Paul says
[2528.68 → 2529.26] The Lord
[2529.26 → 2530.58] Is near
[2530.58 → 2532.92] He's not talking about
[2532.92 → 2534.14] The second coming
[2534.14 → 2535.86] He's talking about
[2535.86 → 2537.30] Spatially
[2537.30 → 2538.26] His
[2538.26 → 2539.84] The Lord's presence
[2539.84 → 2541.36] Is so close
[2541.36 → 2542.32] To us
[2542.32 → 2542.80] Because
[2542.80 → 2543.96] We are in
[2543.96 → 2544.74] Jesus Christ
[2544.74 → 2546.32] And this is
[2546.32 → 2547.68] The central
[2547.68 → 2549.06] Reality
[2549.06 → 2549.70] Of life
[2549.70 → 2550.58] If you are a Christian
[2550.58 → 2551.18] That the Lord
[2551.18 → 2552.44] Is near to you
[2552.44 → 2554.76] And so remember
[2554.76 → 2556.16] Paul is locked up
[2556.16 → 2556.66] In prison
[2556.66 → 2558.84] And he had
[2558.84 → 2559.68] This unbelievable
[2559.68 → 2560.44] Encounter
[2560.44 → 2561.64] Where the risen
[2561.64 → 2562.18] Jesus
[2562.18 → 2563.28] Comes and says
[2563.28 → 2563.78] To him
[2563.78 → 2564.66] Paul
[2564.66 → 2565.68] Here's your calling
[2565.68 → 2566.12] In life
[2566.12 → 2567.32] Go and tell
[2567.32 → 2567.92] The gospel
[2567.92 → 2569.06] To the ends
[2569.06 → 2569.68] Of the earth
[2569.68 → 2572.04] But Paul is
[2572.04 → 2573.72] Stuck in prison
[2573.72 → 2575.16] He is suffering
[2575.16 → 2576.64] And he is isolated
[2576.64 → 2578.46] And so if anyone
[2578.46 → 2579.18] Could be anxious
[2579.18 → 2579.86] If anyone
[2579.86 → 2580.86] Could be filled
[2580.86 → 2581.56] With worry
[2581.56 → 2582.32] And fear
[2582.32 → 2583.86] Surely it would be
[2583.86 → 2585.10] The imprisoned
[2585.10 → 2586.12] Apostle
[2586.12 → 2588.30] And yet
[2588.30 → 2592.38] He is at peace
[2592.38 → 2593.52] Because
[2593.52 → 2594.20] Why?
[2595.12 → 2595.92] Because he knows
[2595.92 → 2596.42] That the Lord
[2596.42 → 2596.98] Is near
[2596.98 → 2597.88] Right?
[2597.96 → 2599.30] God is with him
[2599.30 → 2600.66] In that situation
[2600.66 → 2601.68] With him
[2601.68 → 2602.88] In that jail cell
[2602.88 → 2604.30] That truth
[2604.30 → 2605.10] That reality
[2605.10 → 2606.44] Transforms
[2606.44 → 2607.90] His reality
[2607.90 → 2608.54] It transforms
[2608.54 → 2609.06] His heart
[2609.06 → 2610.88] It takes away
[2610.88 → 2611.58] His worries
[2611.58 → 2612.54] I can sit
[2612.54 → 2613.50] In a jail cell
[2613.50 → 2614.62] And God
[2614.62 → 2615.58] Is with me
[2615.58 → 2616.42] And that changes
[2616.42 → 2616.94] Everything
[2616.94 → 2618.34] You know
[2618.34 → 2618.70] In the
[2618.70 → 2619.68] Old Testament
[2619.68 → 2620.78] Isaiah
[2620.78 → 2622.56] Has one of
[2622.56 → 2623.24] The greatest
[2623.24 → 2624.06] Passages
[2624.06 → 2624.74] In
[2624.74 → 2626.60] Chapter 41
[2626.60 → 2627.14] Verse 10
[2627.14 → 2629.48] Do not fear
[2629.48 → 2630.54] God says
[2630.54 → 2631.80] Why?
[2632.76 → 2633.74] For I am
[2633.74 → 2634.22] With you
[2634.22 → 2636.34] I'm not against you
[2636.34 → 2637.90] I am with you
[2637.90 → 2640.54] Do not be dismayed
[2640.54 → 2642.12] For I am
[2642.12 → 2642.80] Your God
[2642.80 → 2643.78] Right?
[2643.84 → 2645.06] I'm not just God
[2645.06 → 2645.90] In general
[2645.90 → 2646.68] I am
[2646.68 → 2647.86] Your
[2647.86 → 2648.86] God
[2648.86 → 2651.62] It's a wonderful
[2651.62 → 2652.26] Verse there
[2652.26 → 2652.92] In Isaiah
[2652.92 → 2654.44] And so
[2654.44 → 2655.12] If the Lord
[2655.12 → 2655.68] Is near
[2655.68 → 2656.72] If God
[2656.72 → 2657.50] Is with you
[2657.50 → 2658.46] In whatever
[2658.46 → 2659.34] Circumstances
[2659.34 → 2659.96] You're in
[2659.96 → 2660.98] That is the
[2660.98 → 2661.92] Best reason
[2661.92 → 2663.32] To be thankful
[2663.32 → 2663.76] To him
[2663.76 → 2665.16] So no matter
[2665.16 → 2665.96] What is going on
[2665.96 → 2666.78] In your life
[2666.78 → 2668.50] You have a reason
[2668.50 → 2669.66] To be thankful
[2669.66 → 2670.04] To God
[2670.04 → 2670.68] Because he is
[2670.68 → 2671.14] With you
[2671.14 → 2672.22] In that
[2672.22 → 2673.32] Whatever is going on
[2673.32 → 2675.38] And so
[2675.38 → 2675.96] If the Lord
[2675.96 → 2676.40] Is near
[2676.40 → 2676.74] If God
[2676.74 → 2677.40] Is with you
[2677.40 → 2678.44] By the
[2678.44 → 2678.94] Supernatural
[2678.94 → 2679.52] Power of the
[2679.52 → 2680.10] Holy Spirit
[2680.10 → 2681.46] That means
[2681.46 → 2682.02] We can bring
[2682.02 → 2682.44] All of our
[2682.44 → 2683.18] Requests to God
[2683.18 → 2683.58] In prayer
[2683.58 → 2684.34] And that is
[2684.34 → 2685.08] The second thing
[2685.08 → 2685.86] We see
[2685.86 → 2687.08] The second reason
[2687.08 → 2688.70] For thanks
[2688.70 → 2689.64] In
[2689.64 → 2690.94] As an antidote
[2690.94 → 2691.76] To anxiety
[2691.76 → 2693.92] Is that
[2693.92 → 2694.74] That we can
[2694.74 → 2695.36] Talk to him
[2695.36 → 2697.30] The next
[2697.30 → 2698.64] Thing
[2698.64 → 2699.34] The privilege
[2699.34 → 2699.62] Of prayer
[2699.62 → 2700.18] That we can
[2700.18 → 2702.38] Talk to God
[2702.38 → 2702.86] In prayer
[2702.86 → 2703.32] We have the
[2703.32 → 2704.08] Privilege of prayer
[2704.08 → 2705.42] And so look
[2705.42 → 2706.24] With me at
[2706.24 → 2707.34] The next verse
[2707.34 → 2707.96] Verse 6
[2707.96 → 2711.38] So Paul says
[2711.38 → 2711.92] Again
[2711.92 → 2713.42] Do not be anxious
[2713.42 → 2715.26] About anything
[2715.26 → 2716.58] But in
[2716.58 → 2717.90] Every situation
[2717.90 → 2718.88] By prayer
[2718.88 → 2719.82] And petition
[2719.82 → 2720.66] With thanksgiving
[2720.66 → 2722.08] Present your request
[2722.08 → 2722.50] To God
[2722.50 → 2725.02] He's talking
[2725.02 → 2725.46] About prayer
[2725.46 → 2725.80] He uses
[2725.80 → 2726.44] Different words
[2726.44 → 2726.86] For prayer
[2726.86 → 2727.32] Prayer
[2727.32 → 2728.04] Petition
[2728.04 → 2729.52] Presenting your request
[2729.52 → 2730.32] Are always
[2730.32 → 2730.86] Of just talking
[2730.86 → 2731.86] About praying
[2731.86 → 2732.36] To God
[2732.36 → 2733.62] Now
[2733.62 → 2734.82] I think
[2734.82 → 2736.16] For most of us
[2736.16 → 2737.90] Prayer is hard
[2737.90 → 2739.00] Right
[2739.00 → 2739.78] It's not
[2739.78 → 2740.30] Our
[2740.30 → 2742.12] First instinct
[2742.12 → 2743.04] You know
[2743.04 → 2743.82] We often turn
[2743.82 → 2744.38] To prayer
[2744.38 → 2745.66] Not first
[2745.66 → 2746.16] But maybe
[2746.16 → 2747.34] Last
[2747.34 → 2748.72] As a last resort
[2748.72 → 2749.36] Right
[2749.36 → 2749.78] When we're
[2749.78 → 2750.70] At our wits end
[2750.70 → 2751.14] Right
[2751.14 → 2751.66] Nothing else
[2751.66 → 2752.12] Has worked
[2752.12 → 2753.76] I'm going
[2753.76 → 2754.00] To pray
[2754.00 → 2754.42] To God
[2754.42 → 2754.74] Now
[2754.74 → 2756.58] But Paul
[2756.58 → 2757.32] Here invites
[2757.32 → 2758.08] Us to talk
[2758.08 → 2759.00] With God
[2759.00 → 2760.60] When we
[2760.60 → 2761.34] Are anxious
[2761.34 → 2762.58] And when
[2762.58 → 2763.30] We are worried
[2763.30 → 2763.68] And when
[2763.68 → 2764.34] We're afraid
[2764.34 → 2765.92] Okay so now
[2765.92 → 2766.58] Why
[2766.58 → 2767.74] Why is prayer
[2767.74 → 2769.48] So important
[2769.48 → 2770.70] In the context
[2770.70 → 2771.96] Of anxiety
[2771.96 → 2773.88] Well I think
[2773.88 → 2774.70] It's because
[2774.70 → 2776.16] The tendency
[2776.16 → 2776.92] For us
[2776.92 → 2777.40] When we're
[2777.40 → 2777.94] Anxious
[2777.94 → 2779.22] Is to try
[2779.22 → 2779.60] And sort
[2779.60 → 2780.10] Things out
[2780.10 → 2781.08] For ourselves
[2781.08 → 2782.08] Right
[2782.08 → 2782.46] And so
[2782.46 → 2783.28] We go
[2783.28 → 2783.66] And we
[2783.66 → 2784.60] Do this
[2784.60 → 2784.86] And we
[2784.86 → 2785.46] Do that
[2785.46 → 2785.74] And we
[2785.74 → 2786.16] Plan
[2786.16 → 2786.56] And we
[2786.56 → 2787.06] Scheme
[2787.06 → 2787.62] And we're
[2787.62 → 2787.80] Going to
[2787.80 → 2788.16] Work it
[2788.16 → 2788.66] All out
[2788.66 → 2789.18] And we're
[2789.18 → 2789.36] Going to
[2789.36 → 2789.86] Come up
[2789.86 → 2790.38] With ways
[2790.38 → 2791.20] To reduce
[2791.20 → 2792.50] Our anxiety
[2792.50 → 2794.78] And we
[2794.78 → 2794.80] And we
[2794.80 → 2794.82] And we
[2794.82 → 2794.84] And we
[2794.84 → 2794.98] And we
[2794.98 → 2795.04] Have
[2795.04 → 2795.16] And we
[2795.16 → 2795.46] Have even
[2795.46 → 2796.10] Yet gone
[2796.10 → 2796.66] To God
[2796.66 → 2797.62] Right
[2797.62 → 2797.94] And so
[2797.94 → 2798.56] No wonder
[2798.56 → 2799.06] We make
[2799.06 → 2799.52] A mess
[2799.52 → 2800.22] Of things
[2800.22 → 2800.94] Because we're
[2800.94 → 2801.56] Rushing into
[2801.56 → 2802.08] Solving a
[2802.08 → 2802.60] Problem that
[2802.60 → 2803.20] We have no
[2803.20 → 2804.10] Business trying
[2804.10 → 2804.70] To solve
[2804.70 → 2805.44] On our
[2805.44 → 2805.70] Own
[2805.70 → 2807.66] So God
[2807.66 → 2807.68] So God
[2807.68 → 2807.98] Has to
[2807.98 → 2808.28] Say to
[2808.28 → 2808.48] Us
[2808.48 → 2809.24] Pray
[2809.24 → 2810.68] Petition
[2810.68 → 2811.68] Request
[2811.68 → 2812.46] Bring them
[2812.46 → 2812.96] To me
[2812.96 → 2815.44] And what
[2815.44 → 2815.88] Happens
[2815.88 → 2816.32] When we
[2816.32 → 2817.18] Go to
[2817.18 → 2817.44] Prayer
[2817.44 → 2817.98] First
[2817.98 → 2819.20] Is that
[2819.20 → 2819.50] You are
[2819.50 → 2820.04] Then taking
[2820.04 → 2820.46] All of
[2820.46 → 2820.98] Your worries
[2820.98 → 2821.62] All of
[2821.62 → 2822.26] Your anxieties
[2822.26 → 2822.62] All of
[2822.62 → 2823.10] Your fears
[2823.10 → 2823.68] And you're
[2823.68 → 2824.38] Just submitting
[2824.38 → 2824.92] Them to
[2824.92 → 2825.38] God's
[2825.38 → 2825.72] Will
[2825.72 → 2826.90] And God's
[2826.90 → 2827.32] Ways
[2827.32 → 2828.66] Right
[2828.66 → 2828.88] And so
[2828.88 → 2829.10] When you
[2829.10 → 2829.42] Say to
[2829.42 → 2829.62] God
[2829.62 → 2829.88] God
[2829.88 → 2830.36] I need
[2830.36 → 2830.86] Help
[2830.86 → 2831.46] I am
[2831.46 → 2832.20] Anxious
[2832.20 → 2833.72] You are
[2833.72 → 2834.28] Immediately
[2834.28 → 2835.16] Aligning
[2835.16 → 2835.68] Yourself
[2835.68 → 2836.02] With how
[2836.02 → 2836.42] God
[2836.42 → 2836.76] Thinks
[2836.76 → 2837.10] About the
[2837.10 → 2837.38] Matter
[2837.38 → 2838.76] You're
[2838.76 → 2839.30] Turning to
[2839.30 → 2839.46] Him
[2839.46 → 2839.96] And trusting
[2839.96 → 2840.42] Him
[2840.42 → 2841.20] In prayer
[2841.20 → 2843.20] So
[2843.20 → 2843.88] Whoever
[2843.88 → 2845.78] So whenever
[2845.78 → 2846.14] We are
[2846.14 → 2846.60] Worried about
[2846.60 → 2846.96] Something
[2846.96 → 2848.42] We pray
[2848.42 → 2848.90] First
[2848.90 → 2849.58] And so
[2849.58 → 2850.08] But then
[2850.08 → 2850.78] How do
[2850.78 → 2851.24] We pray
[2851.24 → 2852.32] What does
[2852.32 → 2852.78] Paul say
[2852.78 → 2855.26] With
[2855.26 → 2856.44] Thanksgiving
[2856.44 → 2858.26] Now
[2858.26 → 2859.42] Look carefully
[2859.42 → 2860.10] At what he's
[2860.10 → 2860.40] Saying
[2860.40 → 2860.98] Because
[2860.98 → 2861.28] It's
[2861.28 → 2861.62] Actually
[2861.62 → 2861.96] A little
[2861.96 → 2862.70] Counter
[2862.70 → 2863.12] Intuitive
[2863.12 → 2863.34] It's
[2863.34 → 2863.56] A little
[2863.56 → 2863.74] Bit
[2863.74 → 2863.96] Doesn't
[2863.96 → 2864.10] Make
[2864.10 → 2864.34] Sense
[2864.34 → 2864.48] To

[2878.70 → 2879.34] But
[2879.34 → 2879.54] That's
[2879.54 → 2879.70] Not

[3037.96 → 3038.20] Simple
[3038.20 → 3038.60] Answer
[3038.60 → 3038.90] Is
[3038.90 → 3039.06] That

[3039.30 → 3039.70] Often
[3039.70 → 3039.86] We
[3039.86 → 3039.96] Are
[3039.96 → 3040.28] Anxious

[3041.44 → 3041.82] Lost
[3041.82 → 3042.04] A

[3042.58 → 3043.52] Of
[3043.52 → 3044.16] Control
[3044.16 → 3044.92] In
[3044.92 → 3045.04] Our
[3045.04 → 3045.40] Lives
[3045.40 → 3047.28] I
[3047.28 → 3047.40] Mean
[3047.40 → 3047.52] We're
[3047.52 → 3047.72] Never

[3048.66 → 3049.36] Right

[3052.68 → 3053.18] Anxious
[3053.18 → 3053.40] It's
[3053.40 → 3053.72] Because
[3053.72 → 3053.98] The
[3053.98 → 3054.54] Illusion
[3054.54 → 3054.88] Of
[3054.88 → 3055.48] Control

[3058.38 → 3058.72] Faced
[3058.72 → 3058.86] With

[3062.08 → 3062.60] Perhaps
[3062.60 → 3063.14] That
[3063.14 → 3063.38] Are
[3063.38 → 3063.78] Actually
[3063.78 → 3064.32] Outside
[3064.32 → 3064.68] Of
[3064.68 → 3064.80] Your
[3064.80 → 3065.22] Control
[3065.22 → 3066.56] And

[3070.46 → 3070.62] In
[3070.62 → 3070.96] Control
[3070.96 → 3071.68] Okay
[3071.68 → 3071.78] So

[3073.80 → 3074.42] We've
[3074.42 → 3074.78] Lost
[3074.78 → 3074.98] The
[3074.98 → 3075.16] Sense
[3075.16 → 3075.30] Of
[3075.30 → 3075.74] Control

[3076.28 → 3076.88] Uncertain
[3076.88 → 3077.16] About
[3077.16 → 3077.42] How

[3865.86 → 3870.40] Of the goodness of all
[3870.40 → 3889.54] So one of the ways we respond to God's goodness is by giving him our first fruits.
[3890.32 → 3897.44] And so, excuse me, so I just want to read a little passage here from 2 Corinthians chapter 9.

[4183.64 → 4185.64] Amen.
[4213.64 → 4227.70] Thank you for joining us.
[4227.70 → 4228.86] Thank you.
[4228.86 → 4240.58] And we'll see you next time, from the song.
[4240.58 → 4242.58] Welcome to the Dis WS to win a day.
[4242.58 → 4254.42] So for our community prayer today, actually Marian Mandrel sent me a poem that she wrote
[4254.42 → 4261.10] called Giving Thanks, and she was very humble about it. It said you don't have to use it,
[4261.46 → 4268.42] but I really like it. I think it's great. And so I want to basically read it, and this comes from
[4268.42 → 4274.70] her, but I think it's so helpful the way she just explores different areas of the world and of life
[4274.70 → 4281.34] that we can give thanks to. So we might stretch our imaginations for what we can give thanks to God for.
[4282.70 → 4288.96] So we're going to, I want to lead us through this, then at the end, you know, pray for a particular
[4288.96 → 4297.38] need of our church, but we'll start with this Thanksgiving. Now, the way the poem works is
[4297.38 → 4303.76] there's like three lines that all say four, for this, for that, for that, and then we thank you,
[4303.88 → 4309.36] Lord. So every time that happens, I want to invite you to say, pray together with me,
[4309.66 → 4315.36] we thank you, Lord. Let's try it. We thank you, Lord. So three things, and then we thank you,
[4315.42 → 4318.44] Lord. You'll get it. It's a rhythm. Okay, so let's pray together.
[4318.44 → 4332.10] For dawn's early rays and bright blue skies, for refreshing rains that clear the air and alleviate
[4332.10 → 4341.72] thirst, for the heat of the summer sun and the winter fire, we thank you, Lord. For the thunder of
[4341.72 → 4351.62] waterfalls and engines, for the roar of utter silence, for music that delights our ears, compelling dance,
[4352.60 → 4361.42] we thank you, Lord. For the innocence of children and the wisdom of age, for uproars laughter
[4361.42 → 4371.26] and softly whispered prayer, for silly moments and the cleansing of tears, we thank you, Lord.
[4372.72 → 4381.40] For healthy bodies and access to medical care, for inquisitive intellect and ability to learn,
[4381.40 → 4394.86] for education, books, stage and stereos, we thank you, Lord. For the view from the peak and the valley
[4394.86 → 4406.42] below, for cliffs, slopes, snow, skis and ropes, for safety in wide open mountainous spaces and crowded
[4406.42 → 4418.08] city streets, we thank you, Lord. For roots that formed us and new experiences reforming us,
[4418.62 → 4427.82] for new life and memories of those now gone, for strangers who become friends and friends who become
[4427.82 → 4436.40] family, we thank you, Lord. For light and colour and flower and foliage, fireworks and fabric,
[4436.42 → 4446.54] for delightful tastes, exquisite or simple, for clean water and fresh air that exhilarates us,
[4447.48 → 4456.44] we thank you, Lord. For the cacophony of voices and stillness of solitude, for the presence of your
[4456.44 → 4465.60] spirit in both, for restful sleep and your voice in wakefulness, we thank you, Lord.
[4466.42 → 4475.10] For phones, computers and transportation that connects us, for the bond created by loving word or touch,
[4475.48 → 4484.92] for bare hugs and smiles, we thank you, Lord. For the delightful curiosity of a young child's mind,
[4485.10 → 4491.86] for the endless journey of learning through life, for jobs, work, creativeness and play,
[4491.86 → 4500.74] we thank you, Lord. For our country, its soldiers and its leaders, for the peace and freedom we enjoy,
[4501.24 → 4512.48] for the ability to share our resources, we thank you, Lord. For the countries of our roots and countries
[4512.48 → 4523.82] we've been, for other cultures encountered, for the variety of peoples you love, we thank you, Lord. For intimacy with spouses, friends in you,
[4524.04 → 4534.90] for forgiveness from others, from ourselves and from you, for reconciliation with each other, with ourselves and with you, we thank you, Lord.
[4534.90 → 4545.74] For hands that help us along, for times you carry us, for the promise of eternity without tears, we thank you, Lord.
[4546.38 → 4555.52] For the wisdom of the ages and the rock of ages, for the word of life and the water of life, for the prince of peace and the ancient of days,
[4555.52 → 4565.20] we thank you, Lord. For abundant life and eternal life, for the horrible cross and the glorious empty tomb,
[4565.74 → 4573.52] for Emmanuel, God with us, we thank you, Lord. And we thank you, Lord, that you hear our prayers,
[4574.02 → 4577.90] that you know our needs and cares. And we lift to you, Lord,
[4577.90 → 4587.88] our sister Rosalind, whose sister, her physical sister, Rosemary, just passed away this week.
[4588.70 → 4596.84] Lord, we pray that you'd surround Rosalind with your care, your comfort, and the peace of God,
[4597.16 → 4603.34] which transcends all understanding. And we lift all these requests up to you, all these thanksgivings
[4603.34 → 4608.10] to you through our Lord Jesus Christ. And we pray in his name. And all God's people said,
[4608.74 → 4609.34] Amen.
[4611.34 → 4614.46] Okay, let's stand. And we now go
[4614.46 → 4618.26] out into our weeks with the blessing of the Lord upon us.
[4619.04 → 4622.48] I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving that blessing.
[4622.82 → 4627.02] May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord turn his face toward you
[4627.02 → 4630.96] and be gracious to you. May he turn his face upon you
[4630.96 → 4633.08] and give you peace. Amen.
[4634.16 → 4639.24] So you may remain standing as we sing our final song. And then do join us for a time of fellowship
[4639.24 → 4643.26] through the doors in the fellowship hall right after the service.
[4643.26 → 4657.08] Be the peace of God, our Heavenly Father, and the grace of Christ, the risen Son, and the fellowship of God, our Spirit,
[4657.08 → 4670.98] be the highest and the highest and highest within His Son. And to Him, we praise for His glorious strength,
[4670.98 → 4676.88] from the depths of heaven to the heights of heaven. He declared the name of the land of the Spirit,
[4676.88 → 4686.88] and to Him, we praise for His glorious strength, from the depths of heaven to the heights of heaven.
[4686.88 → 4692.78] He declared the name of the Lord, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4692.78 → 4698.68] Christ is eternal, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4698.68 → 4704.58] Christ is eternal, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4704.58 → 4734.58] 
[4734.58 → 4740.48] Christ is eternal, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4740.48 → 4742.38] Christ is eternal, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4742.38 → 4756.30] Christ is eternal, and to Him, we praise for His glory.
[4756.30 → 4786.28] Thank you.
