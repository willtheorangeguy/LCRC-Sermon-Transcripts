[0.00 --> 1.60]  Music
[1.60 --> 11.62]  May of
[15.62 --> 24.32]  May of
[24.32 --> 24.86]  Black
[24.86 --> 27.10]  Will
[27.10 --> 57.08]  Thank you.
[57.10 --> 87.08]  Thank you.
[87.10 --> 117.08]  Thank you.
[117.10 --> 147.08]  Thank you.
[147.10 --> 177.08]  Thank you.
[177.10 --> 207.08]  Thank you.
[207.10 --> 237.08]  Thank you.
[237.10 --> 243.14]  If you are visiting with us today, we're glad that you are with us, and we do hope
[243.14 --> 246.64]  that you will feel welcomed as you worship with us this morning.
[246.64 --> 252.72]  And we're happy to welcome Roger Gross, who will be leading us in singing on piano.
[252.72 --> 256.76]  And we begin by highlighting a few announcements.
[256.76 --> 262.34]  And so one is that our summer Sunday school is beginning this week.
[262.34 --> 265.46]  And we're again thankful for Hedda, who is here with us.
[265.46 --> 269.50]  And I believe there's one or two Sundays still left where we're looking for a helper.
[269.50 --> 270.64]  And I believe there's one or two Sundays still left where we're looking for a helper.
[270.64 --> 272.34]  But I think people were looking at that.
[272.34 --> 279.00]  So maybe do check it out on the foyer table to see if there is a need that may have been covered already,
[279.00 --> 282.94]  but there may be one week that is still available where we're looking for a helper.
[282.94 --> 286.18]  Next week is our summer camp.
[286.18 --> 290.86]  And there have been many volunteers working behind the scenes to get that ready.
[290.86 --> 296.34]  We're getting ready to welcome hopefully about 40 or so kids next week.
[296.34 --> 298.44]  And so please do keep that in prayer.
[299.28 --> 305.60]  And we hope that the kids will come and we'll be able to know our Lord Jesus Christ.
[305.80 --> 308.58]  And the theme of the week will be Jonah.
[309.58 --> 316.24]  And especially the message, part of it is the message that God loves us wherever, even when we run away from him.
[318.04 --> 321.64]  And then next Sunday there will be singing at Mountain View Manor.
[321.64 --> 329.00]  And finally, today is a special day because it is the anniversary celebration of John and Elaine Smith.
[329.76 --> 332.56]  I didn't bring my bulletin so I can see how many years.
[333.46 --> 333.94]  Fifty?
[335.14 --> 335.90]  Five zero.
[336.56 --> 337.40]  Five zero.
[339.38 --> 339.86]  Congratulations.
[340.98 --> 341.66]  That's awesome.
[342.04 --> 348.46]  And so they brought a cake and they will be serving cake with us while we have our coffee.
[348.64 --> 351.18]  So that's something to look forward to after the service.
[351.64 --> 355.98]  And so friends, we worship a great God.
[356.70 --> 359.32]  He is great and he is greatly to be praised.
[359.86 --> 364.80]  So let's listen to his call to us to worship from Psalm 33.
[366.26 --> 367.20]  And I'll begin.
[368.08 --> 370.78]  Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous.
[371.48 --> 373.96]  It is fitting for the upright to praise him.
[374.66 --> 376.28]  Praise the Lord with a harp.
[376.70 --> 379.48]  Make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
[380.26 --> 381.56]  Sing to him a new song.
[382.14 --> 386.06]  Play skillfully and shout for joy together.
[386.70 --> 390.24]  For the word of the Lord is true, right and true.
[390.66 --> 393.26]  He is faithful in all he does.
[393.92 --> 396.80]  The Lord loves righteousness and justice.
[397.58 --> 401.26]  The earth is full of his unfailing love.
[401.26 --> 404.12]  Would you please join me in a prayer of adoration?
[404.32 --> 404.70]  Let's pray.
[406.32 --> 410.78]  Our Father and our God, we come before you this morning as your people.
[411.84 --> 413.12]  Created by you.
[413.94 --> 415.08]  Called by you.
[415.08 --> 425.14]  And Lord, we gather and we join with the voices of Psalm 33, loving to sing your praises.
[425.14 --> 428.02]  For you are God who is great and greatly to be praised.
[428.02 --> 430.54]  You are the God who is above all gods.
[431.20 --> 435.58]  You are the Lord, the creator of the universe and the redeemer of your people.
[435.58 --> 439.46]  And so, Lord, help us as we sing and pray this morning.
[439.46 --> 441.66]  As we listen and confess.
[442.00 --> 446.64]  As we dedicate ourselves to you anew in this hour.
[446.64 --> 451.78]  Help us to rejoice in you as do the heavens and the earth.
[452.78 --> 456.76]  For as your word declares, you are great and greatly to be praised.
[457.70 --> 461.60]  You who are among us always in the person of the Holy Spirit.
[461.70 --> 464.38]  Would you be in our midst in a special way now?
[464.88 --> 467.26]  We ask in Jesus' most holy name.
[467.84 --> 468.16]  Amen.
[468.16 --> 470.52]  Let's stand.
[470.66 --> 472.32]  If you are able in body or in spirit.
[473.28 --> 475.90]  God greets us this morning with these words.
[476.10 --> 478.18]  Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
[478.56 --> 480.20]  And the Lord Jesus Christ.
[480.84 --> 482.56]  And as God has called and he has welcomed us.
[482.62 --> 484.54]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[498.16 --> 528.14]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[528.16 --> 558.14]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[558.14 --> 560.14]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[560.14 --> 562.14]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[562.14 --> 564.14]  Let's turn and greet one another.
[564.14 --> 568.00]  From the shifted shadows of the earth.
[568.00 --> 571.64]  When we lift our eyes to Him.
[571.64 --> 575.60]  When steady alms of mercy.
[575.60 --> 579.86]  Rejoice to gather children in.
[579.86 --> 584.04]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[584.04 --> 586.04]  Every tongue rejoice.
[586.04 --> 588.04]  Every tongue rejoice.
[588.04 --> 591.04]  One heart, one voice.
[591.04 --> 596.04]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[596.04 --> 606.04]  Come those whose joy is morning sun.
[606.04 --> 610.04]  And who's weeping through the night.
[610.04 --> 614.04]  Come those who tell our battles.
[614.04 --> 618.04]  And who'll struggle beneath the fire.
[618.04 --> 622.90]  For His perfect love will never change.
[622.90 --> 626.04]  And His mercies never cease.
[626.04 --> 631.04]  But follow us through all our days.
[631.04 --> 635.04]  With a certain heart have peace.
[635.04 --> 639.04]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[639.04 --> 643.04]  Every tongue rejoice.
[643.04 --> 647.04]  One heart, one voice.
[647.04 --> 650.04]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[650.04 --> 662.04]  Come young and old from every land.
[662.04 --> 666.04]  Men and women of their faith.
[666.04 --> 670.04]  Come those with full or empty hands.
[670.04 --> 674.04]  From the riches of His grace.
[674.04 --> 678.04]  Over all the world His people sing.
[678.04 --> 682.04]  Show to show we hear them call.
[682.04 --> 687.04]  The truth that cries through every age.
[687.04 --> 691.04]  Our God is all in all.
[691.04 --> 693.04]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[693.04 --> 695.04]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[695.04 --> 699.04]  Every tongue rejoice.
[699.04 --> 703.04]  One heart, one voice.
[703.04 --> 707.04]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[707.04 --> 711.04]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[711.04 --> 715.04]  Every tongue rejoice.
[715.04 --> 719.04]  One heart, one voice.
[719.04 --> 747.04]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[747.04 --> 749.04]  O Lord my God.
[749.04 --> 754.04]  When I hear awesome wonder.
[754.04 --> 761.04]  Consider all the works Thy hands have made.
[761.04 --> 764.04]  I see the stars.
[764.04 --> 768.04]  I hear the roaring thunder.
[768.04 --> 775.04]  Thy power throughout the universe display.
[775.04 --> 778.04]  The Lord your God.
[778.04 --> 781.04]  The Lord your God.
[781.04 --> 783.04]  The Lord your God.
[783.04 --> 786.04]  How great thou art.
[786.04 --> 790.04]  How great thou art.
[790.04 --> 796.00]  And since my soul, my Savior, come to thee,
[796.40 --> 806.18]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[806.80 --> 813.64]  When through the worlds and forest glades I wander,
[813.64 --> 821.44]  I hear their words sing sweetly in their trees.
[822.00 --> 827.78]  When I look down from lofty mountain wonder,
[828.94 --> 835.42]  And hear their roar and feel their gentle breeze.
[836.60 --> 842.84]  And since my soul, my Savior, come to thee,
[842.84 --> 849.80]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[850.80 --> 856.64]  And since my soul, my Savior, come to thee,
[858.02 --> 865.60]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[865.60 --> 874.56]  When I shall come, which shall the right glimation,
[874.56 --> 881.56]  And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
[881.56 --> 890.52]  Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
[890.52 --> 897.48]  And I shall proclaim, how great thou art.
[897.48 --> 904.44]  And sing my soul, my Savior, come to thee,
[904.44 --> 911.40]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[911.40 --> 918.84]  And sing my soul, my Savior, come to thee,
[918.84 --> 928.40]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[928.40 --> 946.36]  How great thou art, how great thou art.
[946.36 --> 951.64]  So our Old Testament scripture reading this morning is Psalm 51.
[952.28 --> 952.90]  Psalm 51.
[953.24 --> 957.50]  It's, as a psalter, probably one of the more familiar psalms.
[957.64 --> 961.04]  And we often use it during a time of confession.
[961.68 --> 965.84]  But I chose it today because it really does capture some of the themes
[965.84 --> 968.70]  that we will be looking at later in Romans chapter 7.
[968.70 --> 972.88]  Especially the felt power of sin.
[972.88 --> 975.80]  And the cry for deliverance.
[976.36 --> 977.98]  And that's some of the themes in Romans 7.
[978.10 --> 981.94]  So let's read Psalm 51.
[990.80 --> 994.36]  It's on page 424 in your pew Bible, or we can follow along on the screen.
[994.36 --> 998.94]  For the director of music, a psalm of David,
[999.40 --> 1004.10]  when the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.
[1004.82 --> 1009.06]  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love.
[1009.82 --> 1014.32]  According to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
[1014.86 --> 1017.84]  Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[1018.36 --> 1022.74]  For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me.
[1022.74 --> 1028.38]  Against you, you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
[1028.78 --> 1032.56]  So that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.
[1033.90 --> 1035.42]  Surely I was sinful at birth.
[1036.08 --> 1038.14]  Sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
[1038.98 --> 1041.20]  Surely you desire truth in the inner parts.
[1042.30 --> 1045.50]  You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
[1046.46 --> 1048.36]  Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be clean.
[1048.98 --> 1051.00]  Wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
[1051.00 --> 1053.82]  Let me hear joy and gladness.
[1054.08 --> 1056.20]  Let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
[1057.04 --> 1059.90]  Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.
[1061.02 --> 1065.76]  Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[1066.32 --> 1069.70]  Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
[1069.70 --> 1076.10]  Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[1076.74 --> 1081.16]  Then I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners will turn back to you.
[1082.10 --> 1085.26]  Save me from blood guilt, O God, the God who saves me.
[1085.52 --> 1087.92]  And my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
[1087.92 --> 1092.42]  O Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise.
[1092.84 --> 1095.94]  You do not delight in sacrifice or I would bring it.
[1096.56 --> 1098.68]  You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
[1099.42 --> 1105.68]  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God.
[1105.68 --> 1107.52]  You will not despise.
[1108.40 --> 1110.52]  In your good pleasure, make Zion prosper.
[1111.00 --> 1112.72]  Build up the walls of Jerusalem.
[1113.50 --> 1118.34]  Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you.
[1118.88 --> 1121.64]  Then bulls will be offered on your altar.
[1122.42 --> 1123.70]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1123.70 --> 1133.84]  And so, you know, that does lead us, you know, quite well into our time of confession.
[1134.18 --> 1139.92]  And the thing is, if you are a Christian, you are bold.
[1140.42 --> 1141.40]  You are eager.
[1142.12 --> 1150.50]  You are completely unafraid to actually admit and to acknowledge everything that the Holy Spirit may reveal to you
[1150.50 --> 1154.94]  through his word of your sins and of your faults and of your shortcomings.
[1155.68 --> 1164.80]  Because ultimately, as a Christian, you understand that not only can God remove and forgive all of those sins and offenses,
[1165.46 --> 1167.98]  but he is willing to do so.
[1168.50 --> 1174.10]  And that is what our time of confession is all about, that we do as we gather here each week.
[1174.10 --> 1184.66]  And so let us turn to God and let us confess our sins to the one who forgives and the one who covers our sins by his righteousness.
[1185.14 --> 1187.32]  So please, would you join me in a prayer of confession?
[1190.08 --> 1193.64]  Heavenly Father, we ask that you would help us.
[1194.48 --> 1197.84]  First, Lord, help us to behold all that you are.
[1199.00 --> 1203.38]  You are the holy and just and good God.
[1203.38 --> 1207.96]  But help us, Lord, also to confess our sinfulness.
[1208.60 --> 1210.40]  We confess the ways that we fall short.
[1211.20 --> 1214.20]  We confess the ways that we try to run our own lives.
[1214.96 --> 1217.42]  We look for salvation in other things.
[1217.58 --> 1218.28]  We are defensive.
[1218.82 --> 1222.62]  We don't want to confess our sin to you or to one another.
[1224.08 --> 1229.44]  And so we pray that in the midst of that, we would not only confess and repent of our sin,
[1229.44 --> 1233.88]  but that we would look to you, the God who is so merciful and gracious,
[1234.66 --> 1239.96]  who has condescended to become one of us in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1240.06 --> 1245.32]  to bring us into new life, to do that work of salvation in us and to renew us.
[1245.32 --> 1252.54]  We pray, Lord, that we would trust you to do that in our lives.
[1253.42 --> 1255.52]  And now, Lord, would you search our hearts.
[1256.40 --> 1261.64]  Show us, each one of us, those areas that you want us to admit before you.
[1261.64 --> 1283.08]  Father, would you open our hearts to your grace.
[1283.92 --> 1288.70]  Would you melt our resistance to you by the warmth of your gospel.
[1288.70 --> 1294.90]  And may we always grow and learn to be quick to confess and to be eager to do so,
[1295.18 --> 1297.86]  that we would enjoy an unbroken fellowship with you.
[1298.50 --> 1301.88]  Remind us, Lord, of these things, not just this morning, but every day.
[1302.48 --> 1304.16]  We pray this in Christ's name.
[1304.74 --> 1305.04]  Amen.
[1308.00 --> 1312.00]  The good news of the gospel is that in Christ we are forgiven.
[1312.84 --> 1317.08]  So here are these words of assurance that come to us from Philippians 1, verse 6.
[1318.70 --> 1322.08]  Simply, Paul says this, being confident of this,
[1322.70 --> 1326.76]  that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion
[1326.76 --> 1329.84]  until the day of Christ Jesus.
[1330.38 --> 1331.34]  Thanks be to God.
[1331.94 --> 1336.24]  Let's stand and we'll sing some more songs of praise
[1336.24 --> 1340.06]  and gratitude for God's mercy and grace to us.
[1340.06 --> 1364.90]  God, behold the wondrous mystery
[1364.90 --> 1366.90]  God, behold the joy of God's mercy and grace to us.
[1366.90 --> 1369.22]  In the glory of the King,
[1369.22 --> 1373.80]  In the theme of heaven's praises,
[1374.20 --> 1377.18]  Lord, it's for humanity.
[1378.46 --> 1382.86]  In our longing, in our darkness,
[1383.28 --> 1387.50]  Now the light of life has come,
[1387.96 --> 1392.14]  And to Christ who conceded,
[1392.14 --> 1397.36]  Took on flesh to ransom us.
[1403.14 --> 1408.20]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1408.20 --> 1412.62]  He, the perfect Son of man
[1412.62 --> 1417.00]  In His living, in His suffering
[1417.00 --> 1421.62]  Never trace nor stand of sin
[1421.62 --> 1426.10]  See the true and bear Adam
[1426.10 --> 1430.92]  Come to save the help of the
[1430.92 --> 1435.20]  Christ the great and sure fulfillment
[1435.20 --> 1440.00]  Of their law in Him we stand
[1440.00 --> 1451.00]  Behold the wondrous mystery
[1451.00 --> 1455.00]  Christ the Lord upon the tree
[1455.00 --> 1460.36]  In the stead of ruined sinners
[1460.36 --> 1463.82]  Exile in victory
[1463.82 --> 1468.94]  See the price of our redemption
[1468.94 --> 1472.82]  See their Father's blood unfold
[1472.82 --> 1478.28]  Bringing many sons to glory
[1478.28 --> 1482.06]  Grace and measure, love unto
[1482.06 --> 1494.06]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1494.06 --> 1495.06]  Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1495.06 --> 1499.06]  Send by death the God of life
[1499.06 --> 1503.06]  But not with good and restraining
[1503.06 --> 1507.06]  Praise the Lord He is alive
[1507.06 --> 1512.06]  What a foretaste of deliverance
[1512.06 --> 1517.06]  How unwavering our hope
[1517.06 --> 1521.06]  Let's devour, resurrect it
[1521.06 --> 1526.06]  As we will be when He comes
[1526.06 --> 1530.06]  What a foretaste of deliverance
[1530.06 --> 1536.06]  How unwavering our hope
[1536.06 --> 1538.06]  Christ the power of the Lord
[1538.06 --> 1539.06]  Christ the power of the Lord
[1539.06 --> 1540.06]  Christ the power of the Lord
[1540.06 --> 1541.06]  Christ the power of the Lord
[1541.06 --> 1542.06]  Resurrected
[1542.06 --> 1548.06]  As we will be when He comes
[1548.06 --> 1555.06]  A gift of grace
[1555.06 --> 1560.06]  Is Jesus my Redeemer
[1560.06 --> 1563.06]  There is no more for heaven
[1563.06 --> 1566.06]  No to give
[1566.06 --> 1570.06]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom
[1570.06 --> 1573.06]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
[1573.06 --> 1576.06]  To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
[1576.06 --> 1578.06]  For my life is holy bound to Him
[1578.06 --> 1579.06]  There is no more for heaven
[1579.06 --> 1580.06]  There is no more for heaven
[1580.06 --> 1581.06]  There is no more for heaven
[1581.06 --> 1582.06]  No to give
[1582.06 --> 1584.06]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom
[1584.06 --> 1588.06]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace
[1588.06 --> 1598.06]  To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
[1598.06 --> 1603.06]  For my life is holy bound to Him
[1603.06 --> 1609.06]  O how strange and divine I can see
[1609.06 --> 1612.06]  All is bright and not all
[1612.06 --> 1616.06]  But through past in me
[1616.06 --> 1628.06]  The night is dark
[1628.06 --> 1632.06]  But I am not forsaken
[1632.06 --> 1634.06]  For by my side
[1634.06 --> 1638.06]  This Savior He will stay
[1638.06 --> 1645.06]  I lay my heart in weakness and rejoicing
[1645.06 --> 1651.06]  For in my need His power is displayed
[1651.06 --> 1657.06]  To this I hold my shepherd will defend me
[1657.06 --> 1663.06]  Through the deepest valley He will lead
[1663.06 --> 1667.06]  All that night has been worn
[1667.06 --> 1670.06]  And that shall overcome
[1670.06 --> 1676.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1685.06 --> 1687.06]  No fate I dread
[1687.06 --> 1691.06]  I know I am forgiven
[1691.06 --> 1693.06]  The future's sure
[1693.06 --> 1697.06]  The price it has been paid
[1697.06 --> 1703.06]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[1703.06 --> 1709.06]  And He was raised to overthrow the grave
[1709.06 --> 1716.06]  To this I hold my sin has been defeated
[1716.06 --> 1722.06]  Jesus now and ever is my plea
[1722.06 --> 1725.06]  All that chains are released
[1725.06 --> 1727.06]  I can see
[1727.06 --> 1729.06]  I am free
[1729.06 --> 1730.06]  And all I
[1730.06 --> 1733.06]  But through Christ in me
[1733.06 --> 1748.06]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[1748.06 --> 1754.06]  For He has said that He will bring me home
[1754.06 --> 1755.06]  And day by day
[1755.06 --> 1757.06]  And day by day
[1757.06 --> 1758.06]  I know He will renew me
[1758.06 --> 1767.06]  Until I stand with joy before the throne
[1767.06 --> 1773.06]  To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
[1773.06 --> 1774.06]  For the glory evermore to Him
[1774.06 --> 1779.06]  For the glory evermore to Him
[1779.06 --> 1783.06]  When the rest is complete
[1783.06 --> 1786.06]  Till my lips shall repeat
[1786.06 --> 1791.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1791.06 --> 1796.06]  When the rest is complete
[1796.06 --> 1797.06]  Till my lips shall repeat
[1797.06 --> 1801.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1801.06 --> 1805.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1805.06 --> 1810.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1810.06 --> 1814.06]  Yet no eye but through Christ in me
[1814.06 --> 1830.06]  Well, let me pray for the kids
[1830.06 --> 1834.06]  Before they head to Sunday school. Let's pray.
[1834.06 --> 1836.06]  Lord Jesus, please be with our children
[1836.06 --> 1839.06]  as they learn about you again today.
[1839.06 --> 1841.06]  Lord, would you bless their teachers,
[1841.06 --> 1843.06]  bless their time together.
[1843.06 --> 1845.86]  and may their hearts be open to the truth of your word.
[1846.30 --> 1848.10]  We pray this in your name. Amen.
[1849.30 --> 1852.60]  And the children are dismissed to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1868.78 --> 1870.84]  And so we are in Romans chapter 7.
[1870.84 --> 1873.76]  So I invite you to open there in your P-Bible.
[1875.34 --> 1876.88]  Romans chapter 7.
[1886.74 --> 1889.22]  So that is on page 840.
[1889.90 --> 1891.02]  840 in your P-Bible.
[1891.56 --> 1893.18]  And so we've been going through the book of Romans.
[1893.62 --> 1899.14]  And our passage today is particularly helpful, I think,
[1899.14 --> 1901.80]  for understanding the Christian life.
[1902.36 --> 1909.30]  Because what we're going to see here is Paul is opening up his heart to us as we read here.
[1909.60 --> 1910.60]  He's opening up his heart.
[1910.70 --> 1912.40]  He's giving us a window into his heart.
[1912.86 --> 1915.80]  And he's talking about his own experience.
[1915.80 --> 1921.94]  But it is also the experience of every Christian throughout the ages.
[1922.66 --> 1924.04]  And us as well today.
[1925.28 --> 1928.24]  And so let's read our passage, Romans 7.
[1928.46 --> 1932.56]  And we're reading from verse 14 to the end of the chapter.
[1932.56 --> 1934.86]  So beginning in verse 14.
[1934.86 --> 1937.56]  We know that the law is spiritual.
[1938.12 --> 1941.52]  But I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
[1942.28 --> 1944.10]  I do not understand what I do.
[1944.64 --> 1947.18]  For what I want to do, I do not do.
[1947.64 --> 1949.24]  But what I hate, I do.
[1950.08 --> 1952.46]  And if I do what I do not want to do,
[1952.88 --> 1954.54]  I agree that the law is good.
[1955.20 --> 1958.80]  As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it,
[1958.90 --> 1960.54]  but it is sin living in me.
[1960.54 --> 1963.88]  I know that nothing good lives in me,
[1964.32 --> 1966.12]  that is, in my sinful nature.
[1966.70 --> 1968.94]  For I have the desire to do what is good,
[1969.00 --> 1970.54]  but I cannot carry it out.
[1970.98 --> 1973.30]  For what I do is not the good I want to do.
[1973.40 --> 1975.56]  No, the evil I do not want to do.
[1975.66 --> 1976.70]  This I keep on doing.
[1977.60 --> 1979.60]  Now if I do what I do not want to do,
[1979.66 --> 1981.44]  it is no longer I who do it,
[1982.02 --> 1984.50]  but it is sin living in me that does it.
[1985.26 --> 1986.82]  So I find this law at work.
[1986.92 --> 1989.34]  When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
[1989.34 --> 1992.42]  For in my inner being, I delight in God's law,
[1992.76 --> 1996.34]  but I see another law at work in the members of my body,
[1996.44 --> 1998.72]  waging war against the law of my mind
[1998.72 --> 2001.16]  and making me a prisoner of the law of sin
[2001.16 --> 2002.40]  at work within my members.
[2003.00 --> 2004.50]  What a wretched man I am,
[2004.96 --> 2007.06]  who will rescue me from this body of death.
[2008.02 --> 2010.76]  Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2011.44 --> 2014.58]  So then I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law,
[2014.58 --> 2018.64]  but in the sinful nature, a slave to the law of sin.
[2019.34 --> 2020.78]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2022.78 --> 2023.92]  Well, let's pray.
[2024.16 --> 2026.60]  Let's ask for God's blessing upon his word.
[2028.26 --> 2031.02]  Gracious Father, we pray that the Holy Spirit
[2031.02 --> 2034.92]  would now come and soften our hearts
[2034.92 --> 2038.42]  so that the seed of your word might be planted in good soil
[2038.42 --> 2041.50]  and may it then bear fruit in our lives
[2041.50 --> 2043.50]  for your honor and your glory.
[2043.94 --> 2045.72]  We ask through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2045.72 --> 2046.72]  Amen.
[2049.44 --> 2053.56]  So Robert Louis Stevenson was a writer
[2053.56 --> 2057.54]  probably best known for his book Treasure Island.
[2057.92 --> 2059.54]  Who has read Treasure Island?
[2060.60 --> 2061.50]  Okay, a lot of you have.
[2061.58 --> 2062.66]  Or who has seen the movie?
[2063.12 --> 2064.44]  I think it's like an old Disney movie.
[2064.84 --> 2066.16]  It's also pretty entertaining.
[2066.16 --> 2070.10]  You know, of course, it's an adventure story
[2070.10 --> 2074.58]  about pirates with parrots perched on their shoulders
[2074.58 --> 2078.32]  and, you know, deserted desert islands,
[2078.86 --> 2081.16]  tropical islands with treasure maps marked with an X.
[2082.20 --> 2085.06]  But three years after he published Treasure Island,
[2085.74 --> 2087.92]  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a shorter work.
[2088.06 --> 2089.50]  It was only 80 pages long
[2089.50 --> 2093.90]  called The Strange Case of Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde.
[2093.90 --> 2095.12]  Who has read that one?
[2096.20 --> 2097.20]  Some of you have.
[2097.72 --> 2099.98]  It's also, it's a great read and I recommend it.
[2100.02 --> 2100.58]  It's pretty short.
[2101.52 --> 2105.10]  But did you know that it is based on our passage today?
[2106.48 --> 2107.48]  So that's kind of cool.
[2107.88 --> 2108.98]  So let's think about that.
[2109.50 --> 2111.64]  Now, Robert Louis Stevenson was born
[2111.64 --> 2114.92]  into a Scottish Presbyterian home.
[2115.92 --> 2118.34]  His father taught him Reformed theology
[2118.34 --> 2120.10]  from when he was growing up.
[2120.10 --> 2122.56]  And so he knew about this inner struggle
[2122.56 --> 2125.62]  of the Christian against indwelling sin.
[2126.76 --> 2130.78]  And in the story, we've got a guy named Dr. Jekyll.
[2131.00 --> 2132.76]  Now, for me, I always got confused
[2132.76 --> 2135.00]  because Dr. Jekyll sounds kind of sinister,
[2135.40 --> 2136.64]  but actually he is the good guy.
[2137.12 --> 2138.04]  So he is a doctor.
[2138.42 --> 2140.64]  He's admired and well-respected
[2140.64 --> 2143.42]  and he wants to live a good moral life.
[2143.42 --> 2146.10]  But he comes to the conclusion
[2146.10 --> 2148.14]  that he has this dark side,
[2148.64 --> 2150.22]  this dark part of him,
[2150.56 --> 2152.58]  that is always drawn towards evil
[2152.58 --> 2155.54]  and it was keeping him from doing the good
[2155.54 --> 2157.86]  that he truly wanted to do in the world.
[2158.82 --> 2160.48]  So he came up with an idea.
[2161.40 --> 2162.94]  He would invent a potion.
[2163.72 --> 2167.24]  And the potion would separate the evil side
[2167.24 --> 2169.00]  and the good side
[2169.00 --> 2171.90]  into these two distinct personalities.
[2171.90 --> 2174.06]  And so his evil side,
[2174.16 --> 2174.82]  his evil self,
[2174.92 --> 2176.96]  became Edward Hyde.
[2177.94 --> 2179.92]  And Hyde would come out at night
[2179.92 --> 2182.88]  and commit all kinds of mischief and evil,
[2183.22 --> 2184.82]  up to and including murder.
[2186.22 --> 2187.66]  And now that name, Hyde,
[2187.70 --> 2189.02]  H-Y-D-E,
[2189.76 --> 2191.80]  is kind of a double pun, right?
[2191.86 --> 2193.80]  It can mean Hyde as in hidden
[2193.80 --> 2196.84]  and it can also mean hideous.
[2197.60 --> 2198.74]  And so Edward Hyde,
[2198.80 --> 2201.08]  he represents this evil part of us
[2201.08 --> 2202.98]  that we try to keep hidden.
[2204.46 --> 2207.42]  But having separated off Hyde,
[2207.94 --> 2209.02]  now during the day,
[2209.14 --> 2211.08]  Dr. Jekyll can be free
[2211.08 --> 2212.78]  from the influence of evil
[2212.78 --> 2214.86]  and he can do the good he wants to do.
[2215.86 --> 2217.84]  But the minute he took the potion,
[2218.06 --> 2220.58]  he realized that he had miscalculated
[2220.58 --> 2222.70]  because his evil side,
[2222.82 --> 2223.54]  Edward Hyde,
[2223.64 --> 2226.80]  was way more evil than he thought.
[2226.80 --> 2229.38]  And then to his shock,
[2229.48 --> 2230.30]  he discovered,
[2230.82 --> 2232.80]  I like sin.
[2233.68 --> 2235.74]  Sin is not as bad as I thought it was.
[2236.24 --> 2238.30]  And so he grows to relish
[2238.30 --> 2240.20]  the opportunities that come
[2240.20 --> 2241.68]  when he becomes Edward Hyde
[2241.68 --> 2244.50]  to sin without restraint
[2244.50 --> 2245.92]  from his good side.
[2245.92 --> 2248.86]  And as things go on in the story,
[2248.96 --> 2250.22]  it tells us that Hyde,
[2251.44 --> 2254.42]  that he became Edward Hyde more and more,
[2255.22 --> 2257.20]  and he actually loses the ability
[2257.20 --> 2259.00]  to become Dr. Jekyll
[2259.00 --> 2260.72]  until finally he discovers
[2260.72 --> 2263.30]  that Hyde has completely taken over
[2263.30 --> 2265.16]  and he becomes this monster.
[2266.26 --> 2268.76]  And it all comes from our passage this morning.
[2270.40 --> 2271.94]  And so what Robert Louis Stevenson
[2271.94 --> 2273.44]  and what Paul are saying
[2273.44 --> 2274.74]  is that we all experience
[2274.74 --> 2276.78]  this struggle in the Christian life.
[2277.32 --> 2277.42]  Right?
[2277.48 --> 2279.60]  Where even when we want to do good,
[2280.10 --> 2281.18]  we want to live for God,
[2281.24 --> 2282.68]  we want to honor and please him,
[2282.84 --> 2284.70]  we have this evil within us
[2284.70 --> 2286.20]  that makes us do the things
[2286.20 --> 2287.20]  we don't want to do.
[2287.90 --> 2289.14]  But we do it anyways,
[2289.42 --> 2291.76]  and actually sometimes we enjoy our sin,
[2292.06 --> 2293.86]  but then sometimes we hate our sin,
[2294.52 --> 2296.38]  and we are conflicted.
[2297.08 --> 2298.68]  We live conflicted lives.
[2298.68 --> 2300.44]  And we can then all resonate
[2300.44 --> 2302.80]  with Paul's cry of frustration
[2302.80 --> 2303.62]  when he says,
[2303.86 --> 2305.96]  what a wretched man I am.
[2306.70 --> 2309.02]  What a wretched woman I am.
[2310.28 --> 2311.22]  But praise God,
[2311.30 --> 2312.80]  because Romans chapter 7
[2312.80 --> 2314.64]  does not end the way
[2314.64 --> 2317.98]  Robert Louis Stevenson ends his story.
[2318.86 --> 2321.44]  After Paul tells us
[2321.44 --> 2323.06]  about the struggle of his own heart,
[2323.16 --> 2323.62]  he says,
[2323.94 --> 2324.80]  thanks be to God
[2324.80 --> 2326.72]  who delivers me
[2326.72 --> 2328.00]  through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2328.00 --> 2329.92]  And so for the Christian,
[2330.02 --> 2330.68]  there is hope.
[2331.60 --> 2333.06]  There is hope for deliverance.
[2333.14 --> 2333.62]  There is hope,
[2333.80 --> 2335.14]  not that we would have just become
[2335.14 --> 2335.88]  more and more evil,
[2336.00 --> 2336.60]  but actually,
[2337.26 --> 2337.96]  the Christian life
[2337.96 --> 2339.32]  is a path of becoming
[2339.32 --> 2341.40]  more and more good
[2341.40 --> 2343.44]  to the point where evil
[2343.44 --> 2344.58]  will one day
[2344.58 --> 2346.20]  no longer dwell within us.
[2348.76 --> 2350.02]  So for the Christian,
[2350.18 --> 2351.68]  there is this hope of deliverance,
[2351.78 --> 2352.96]  but this path also,
[2353.14 --> 2353.82]  this passage,
[2354.28 --> 2356.30]  also gives us courage
[2356.30 --> 2357.54]  in this battle,
[2357.64 --> 2358.72]  this lifelong battle
[2358.72 --> 2359.72]  that we will live in,
[2359.98 --> 2362.20]  it gives us some reason for courage.
[2362.36 --> 2363.56]  And that's what I want to look at today.
[2363.86 --> 2364.48]  But now,
[2364.54 --> 2365.84]  before we get into the passage,
[2366.40 --> 2368.36]  I want you to be aware
[2368.36 --> 2369.50]  that there is actually
[2369.50 --> 2370.36]  a lot of debate
[2370.36 --> 2371.88]  about this passage.
[2372.04 --> 2372.92]  In the book of Romans,
[2372.98 --> 2373.52]  this is probably
[2373.52 --> 2375.58]  one of the most controversial passages
[2375.58 --> 2376.22]  there is.
[2376.98 --> 2378.60]  And the debate is about
[2378.60 --> 2381.12]  who is Paul talking about?
[2381.12 --> 2383.90]  And so that's the essence
[2383.90 --> 2384.46]  of the debate.
[2384.60 --> 2386.78]  Who is Paul talking about here?
[2387.44 --> 2388.94]  Is Paul talking about a person
[2388.94 --> 2389.92]  who is not a Christian?
[2390.86 --> 2392.80]  Or is he talking about himself
[2392.80 --> 2394.54]  before he became converted?
[2395.54 --> 2396.66]  Is he talking about
[2396.66 --> 2397.82]  the experience of Israel
[2397.82 --> 2399.36]  with the law?
[2399.86 --> 2400.82]  Is he talking about
[2400.82 --> 2401.90]  an immature believer?
[2402.68 --> 2403.36]  Or is he talking about
[2403.36 --> 2404.12]  a mature believer?
[2404.66 --> 2404.76]  Right?
[2404.88 --> 2406.08]  And tons of ink
[2406.08 --> 2406.94]  has been spilt
[2406.94 --> 2409.02]  on this topic.
[2409.02 --> 2410.78]  I think in some seminaries
[2410.78 --> 2411.74]  you can take a class
[2411.74 --> 2412.76]  on Romans chapter 7
[2412.76 --> 2414.22]  where you explore
[2414.22 --> 2416.32]  all of these different arguments.
[2417.44 --> 2418.18]  That's not what
[2418.18 --> 2419.04]  we're going to do today.
[2419.38 --> 2419.94]  I'm going to tell you
[2419.94 --> 2420.62]  the right answer.
[2421.10 --> 2421.84]  I'm just kidding.
[2422.50 --> 2423.34]  But I will tell you
[2423.34 --> 2423.92]  what I believe.
[2424.24 --> 2424.96]  I believe,
[2425.30 --> 2426.26]  because I have to
[2426.26 --> 2427.78]  preach this somehow, right?
[2429.66 --> 2430.42]  I believe,
[2430.50 --> 2431.02]  and I'm going to go
[2431.02 --> 2432.02]  with kind of the tradition
[2432.02 --> 2432.90]  of the Reformed Church
[2432.90 --> 2434.10]  from Augustine to Calvin
[2434.10 --> 2435.28]  and Luther and onward,
[2436.06 --> 2438.18]  that Paul is talking about us.
[2438.18 --> 2439.44]  He's talking about
[2439.44 --> 2439.96]  the Christian.
[2440.10 --> 2440.68]  He's talking about
[2440.68 --> 2442.50]  you and me.
[2443.40 --> 2445.38]  Now, one reason I think that,
[2445.84 --> 2447.08]  that Paul is talking about
[2447.08 --> 2448.58]  just the Christian experience
[2448.58 --> 2450.50]  is because he's writing
[2450.50 --> 2451.50]  in the present tense.
[2452.36 --> 2452.50]  Right?
[2452.56 --> 2453.56]  Up until this point,
[2453.98 --> 2454.66]  Paul has been writing
[2454.66 --> 2455.44]  in the past tense.
[2455.54 --> 2456.52]  But then verse 14,
[2456.68 --> 2458.56]  he moves into the present tense
[2458.56 --> 2459.38]  writing like,
[2459.46 --> 2460.12]  this is happening
[2460.12 --> 2461.02]  to me right now.
[2462.40 --> 2463.96]  But the main reason
[2463.96 --> 2465.20]  I think he's writing
[2465.20 --> 2466.00]  about the Christian
[2466.00 --> 2468.14]  is that when I read
[2468.14 --> 2468.70]  these verses,
[2468.98 --> 2470.34]  it completely resonates
[2470.34 --> 2470.86]  with me.
[2471.68 --> 2472.12]  Right?
[2472.16 --> 2473.10]  This just sounds like
[2473.10 --> 2473.92]  my experience
[2473.92 --> 2474.58]  as a Christian.
[2475.50 --> 2476.76]  And Christians
[2476.76 --> 2477.90]  over the centuries
[2477.90 --> 2478.66]  have resonated
[2478.66 --> 2479.56]  with what Paul
[2479.56 --> 2480.42]  is describing here.
[2480.80 --> 2481.96]  I do the things
[2481.96 --> 2483.16]  that I don't want to do.
[2483.72 --> 2484.94]  And I don't do the things
[2484.94 --> 2485.72]  that I do want to do,
[2485.80 --> 2486.52]  oh wretched man
[2486.52 --> 2487.10]  that I am.
[2488.54 --> 2490.02]  And this is our experience.
[2490.44 --> 2491.40]  And it's our experience
[2491.40 --> 2492.54]  because we live
[2492.54 --> 2493.66]  in two realities
[2493.66 --> 2494.56]  at the same time.
[2495.04 --> 2495.62]  Okay, first,
[2496.30 --> 2497.00]  and wonderfully,
[2497.32 --> 2498.70]  when we trust in Jesus,
[2499.26 --> 2500.06]  God gives us
[2500.06 --> 2500.82]  a new identity.
[2501.50 --> 2501.72]  Right?
[2501.76 --> 2503.26]  We become a Christian.
[2503.62 --> 2504.12]  In Christ,
[2504.22 --> 2505.74]  we are a new creation.
[2506.28 --> 2507.66]  We are united to Jesus.
[2508.32 --> 2509.74]  He gives us a heart
[2509.74 --> 2510.84]  and a mind
[2510.84 --> 2513.06]  that loves what he loves.
[2514.06 --> 2514.20]  Right?
[2514.20 --> 2515.26]  That desires to
[2515.26 --> 2517.40]  obey his commands,
[2517.50 --> 2518.30]  to do his will.
[2518.96 --> 2520.32]  That's one reality
[2520.32 --> 2520.96]  of the Christian.
[2520.96 --> 2523.10]  But there's a second reality
[2523.10 --> 2523.70]  as well,
[2523.84 --> 2524.58]  which is that sin
[2524.58 --> 2526.12]  still resides within us.
[2526.86 --> 2527.00]  Right?
[2527.04 --> 2527.92]  When you become a Christian,
[2528.10 --> 2528.94]  sin doesn't automatically
[2528.94 --> 2530.40]  poof and disappear.
[2531.78 --> 2532.50]  J.I. Packer
[2532.50 --> 2533.18]  put it this way.
[2533.30 --> 2533.90]  He said that
[2533.90 --> 2534.96]  indwelling sin
[2534.96 --> 2535.78]  is Paul's
[2535.78 --> 2537.24]  troublesome inmate
[2537.24 --> 2538.80]  while he remains
[2538.80 --> 2539.34]  in the body.
[2539.98 --> 2540.24]  And I think
[2540.24 --> 2541.96]  it's a wonderful image.
[2542.10 --> 2543.14]  It's troublesome inmate.
[2545.38 --> 2546.46]  And so we live
[2546.46 --> 2548.14]  in these two realities
[2548.14 --> 2549.22]  at the same time.
[2549.22 --> 2551.26]  And what we've seen
[2551.26 --> 2552.52]  over the past few sermons
[2552.52 --> 2553.02]  in Romans
[2553.02 --> 2554.88]  is how God brings us,
[2555.18 --> 2556.02]  he brings Christians
[2556.02 --> 2558.12]  from the kingdom of Adam
[2558.12 --> 2560.86]  into the kingdom of Christ.
[2562.02 --> 2563.02]  And very simply,
[2563.16 --> 2563.66]  he does that
[2563.66 --> 2565.84]  by uniting people
[2565.84 --> 2566.70]  to Jesus Christ.
[2566.82 --> 2568.00]  He unites us to Christ
[2568.00 --> 2569.72]  and he brings us
[2569.72 --> 2570.46]  into his kingdom.
[2571.56 --> 2573.10]  But what we learn now
[2573.10 --> 2574.12]  in today's passage
[2574.12 --> 2575.34]  is that there is this
[2575.34 --> 2577.30]  overlap of two kingdoms
[2577.30 --> 2578.66]  when you become a Christian.
[2578.66 --> 2579.50]  So if you can imagine
[2579.50 --> 2580.54]  the kingdom of Adam
[2580.54 --> 2581.50]  as this big circle
[2581.50 --> 2582.38]  and you imagine
[2582.38 --> 2583.36]  the kingdom of Christ
[2583.36 --> 2584.06]  as a circle,
[2584.30 --> 2585.62]  there's an overlap
[2585.62 --> 2587.80]  and we live in that overlap.
[2589.72 --> 2590.20]  Right?
[2590.32 --> 2591.62]  So you're,
[2591.76 --> 2592.36]  on the one hand,
[2592.42 --> 2592.98]  you're brought
[2592.98 --> 2594.16]  into the kingdom of Jesus.
[2594.36 --> 2594.66]  Yes.
[2595.46 --> 2596.72]  You're united to Christ
[2596.72 --> 2597.26]  in his death
[2597.26 --> 2597.80]  and resurrection.
[2598.02 --> 2598.30]  Sin,
[2599.06 --> 2599.72]  you are free
[2599.72 --> 2600.86]  from the condemnation
[2600.86 --> 2601.40]  of sin
[2601.40 --> 2602.80]  and yet you still
[2602.80 --> 2604.26]  live in this
[2604.26 --> 2605.42]  mortal body
[2605.42 --> 2606.60]  in the kingdom
[2606.60 --> 2607.64]  of Adam
[2607.64 --> 2610.66]  because you still sin,
[2610.98 --> 2612.38]  because you still die.
[2613.96 --> 2615.16]  And so we live in
[2615.16 --> 2616.36]  what is often called
[2616.36 --> 2617.02]  the already
[2617.02 --> 2618.36]  but not yet.
[2619.88 --> 2620.82]  And Christians,
[2621.00 --> 2622.12]  we are looking forward
[2622.12 --> 2623.14]  to that day
[2623.14 --> 2624.42]  when Jesus comes again
[2624.42 --> 2625.62]  and he gives us
[2625.62 --> 2626.74]  new resurrection bodies
[2626.74 --> 2627.28]  which will be
[2627.28 --> 2628.64]  completely free from sin
[2628.64 --> 2630.96]  and that cannot die.
[2630.96 --> 2632.82]  And then the kingdom
[2632.82 --> 2633.80]  of God will have come
[2633.80 --> 2634.54]  in all of its fullness
[2634.54 --> 2635.70]  and the kingdom of Adam
[2635.70 --> 2636.86]  will be destroyed completely.
[2637.68 --> 2639.18]  But until that day comes,
[2639.42 --> 2640.16]  we continue
[2640.16 --> 2641.74]  to live
[2641.74 --> 2643.52]  in this struggle,
[2643.76 --> 2644.60]  in this battle,
[2644.90 --> 2645.82]  our whole lives.
[2646.34 --> 2646.90]  So again then,
[2646.98 --> 2648.40]  how can we have this courage
[2648.40 --> 2649.90]  to live in this battle?
[2650.46 --> 2651.00]  What do we learn
[2651.00 --> 2651.64]  from this passage?
[2652.36 --> 2654.06]  And in our time remaining,
[2654.32 --> 2655.38]  I want to say that,
[2655.48 --> 2655.64]  you know,
[2655.68 --> 2656.20]  I want to pull out
[2656.20 --> 2657.10]  five different things
[2657.10 --> 2657.84]  I think we learn
[2657.84 --> 2658.92]  and we're going to look
[2658.92 --> 2659.94]  at each of them briefly.
[2660.84 --> 2661.80]  So five things.
[2661.86 --> 2662.78]  The first one is this.
[2665.18 --> 2666.78]  Simply that the struggle
[2666.78 --> 2667.46]  is real.
[2668.74 --> 2669.58]  Okay, that's the first thing.
[2669.70 --> 2670.52]  The struggle is real.
[2671.64 --> 2672.72]  No one ever gets
[2672.72 --> 2673.78]  so advanced
[2673.78 --> 2674.96]  in the Christian life
[2674.96 --> 2676.50]  that they will never
[2676.50 --> 2678.44]  then struggle with sin.
[2679.36 --> 2679.80]  Right?
[2679.90 --> 2680.50]  And so it's Paul
[2680.50 --> 2681.72]  who says in verse 19,
[2682.56 --> 2684.10]  for I do not do.
[2684.64 --> 2685.82]  Okay, Paul the apostle,
[2686.42 --> 2687.40]  okay, says,
[2687.60 --> 2688.76]  I do not do the good
[2688.76 --> 2689.48]  I want to do,
[2689.98 --> 2690.56]  but the evil
[2690.56 --> 2691.62]  I do not want to do,
[2691.74 --> 2693.10]  this I keep on doing.
[2694.16 --> 2695.00]  Someone has once said
[2695.00 --> 2695.98]  that Paul must have been
[2695.98 --> 2696.58]  a golfer.
[2697.18 --> 2697.84]  Who like here
[2697.84 --> 2698.54]  likes to golf?
[2699.14 --> 2699.94]  I used to golf.
[2700.36 --> 2701.38]  Okay, so you can
[2701.38 --> 2702.68]  maybe relate with this.
[2704.44 --> 2705.20]  Anyone who's ever
[2705.20 --> 2705.72]  played golf
[2705.72 --> 2706.52]  will repeatedly
[2706.52 --> 2707.62]  throughout the round
[2707.62 --> 2708.06]  say,
[2708.52 --> 2709.20]  for I do not do
[2709.20 --> 2710.28]  the good I want to do,
[2710.40 --> 2711.08]  but the evil
[2711.08 --> 2712.32]  I do not want to do,
[2712.44 --> 2713.62]  this I keep on doing.
[2714.38 --> 2715.12]  I didn't want
[2715.12 --> 2715.86]  the ball to go there.
[2715.92 --> 2716.46]  I wanted it to go
[2716.46 --> 2716.92]  on the green,
[2717.06 --> 2718.32]  but it goes into the pond.
[2718.76 --> 2719.92]  Okay, this is the
[2719.92 --> 2721.24]  frustration of golf.
[2723.02 --> 2724.40]  I want to trust God,
[2724.56 --> 2725.98]  but I don't.
[2726.80 --> 2728.56]  I want not to worry,
[2728.76 --> 2729.32]  but I do.
[2730.06 --> 2731.44]  I want to be generous,
[2731.66 --> 2732.16]  but I'm not.
[2732.56 --> 2733.40]  I want to be
[2733.40 --> 2735.34]  hospitable and kind,
[2735.56 --> 2736.20]  but I'm not.
[2736.30 --> 2737.12]  I love God,
[2737.22 --> 2738.08]  but there are so many
[2738.08 --> 2738.80]  things in my life
[2738.80 --> 2739.26]  that indicate
[2739.26 --> 2740.10]  that I do not
[2740.10 --> 2740.98]  love God.
[2742.70 --> 2743.28]  You know,
[2743.34 --> 2744.08]  and so when we look
[2744.08 --> 2744.64]  at the Bible,
[2744.64 --> 2746.20]  and it tells us
[2746.20 --> 2747.18]  what to do,
[2747.54 --> 2748.66]  like what God's will is,
[2748.74 --> 2749.56]  who of us is able
[2749.56 --> 2750.10]  to say,
[2750.98 --> 2751.20]  yes,
[2751.28 --> 2751.98]  that is exactly
[2751.98 --> 2753.14]  what my life looks like.
[2754.06 --> 2754.82]  I open the Bible
[2754.82 --> 2755.46]  and it's a mirror
[2755.46 --> 2756.18]  of my life,
[2757.30 --> 2757.50]  right?
[2757.54 --> 2758.50]  Or who of us
[2758.50 --> 2758.86]  can say,
[2758.94 --> 2759.84]  I have figured out
[2759.84 --> 2761.34]  how to have a perfect
[2761.34 --> 2762.28]  devotional life.
[2763.40 --> 2764.58]  Or I have figured out
[2764.58 --> 2765.28]  how to,
[2765.48 --> 2765.68]  you know,
[2765.76 --> 2766.88]  kill temptation
[2766.88 --> 2767.98]  and lust in my life.
[2768.98 --> 2769.82]  I've figured out
[2769.82 --> 2770.94]  a way to kill pride.
[2771.90 --> 2772.02]  Right?
[2772.10 --> 2773.06]  And who of us here
[2773.06 --> 2774.74]  has a perfect track record?
[2775.30 --> 2776.42]  I don't think any of us
[2776.42 --> 2777.00]  can say that.
[2778.60 --> 2780.42]  But I want you to know
[2780.42 --> 2783.06]  that this is the normal
[2783.06 --> 2784.32]  Christian experience.
[2784.94 --> 2785.10]  Okay?
[2785.12 --> 2786.02]  This is very normal.
[2786.18 --> 2786.96]  Your struggle
[2786.96 --> 2788.30]  that you may feel
[2788.30 --> 2790.52]  is not unusual.
[2790.72 --> 2791.84]  You are not weird
[2791.84 --> 2792.70]  or unusual
[2792.70 --> 2793.74]  that you struggle
[2793.74 --> 2794.26]  with sin.
[2794.34 --> 2795.56]  I want you to know that.
[2797.32 --> 2797.76]  Actually,
[2797.98 --> 2799.78]  you will be in Romans 7
[2799.78 --> 2800.66]  the rest of your life.
[2801.42 --> 2802.12]  And that can sound
[2802.12 --> 2803.06]  kind of like a downer.
[2803.94 --> 2805.08]  That you will struggle
[2805.08 --> 2805.72]  with sin
[2805.72 --> 2806.54]  the rest of your life.
[2806.66 --> 2808.24]  But that does not mean
[2808.24 --> 2808.96]  you will not grow
[2808.96 --> 2809.88]  in the Christian life.
[2810.26 --> 2810.40]  Right?
[2810.44 --> 2811.60]  As you cooperate
[2811.60 --> 2812.42]  with the Holy Spirit,
[2812.50 --> 2813.74]  as you abide in Christ,
[2813.84 --> 2814.90]  you can overcome
[2814.90 --> 2816.52]  sin in your life.
[2816.94 --> 2818.66]  You can follow Jesus
[2818.66 --> 2820.16]  more and more closely
[2820.16 --> 2821.26]  in different areas
[2821.26 --> 2821.92]  of your life.
[2822.38 --> 2823.40]  But you will never
[2823.40 --> 2824.96]  be totally free
[2824.96 --> 2825.86]  from sin.
[2825.86 --> 2828.58]  So that's the first point.
[2828.66 --> 2829.44]  The struggle is real.
[2829.84 --> 2830.66]  The second point
[2830.66 --> 2832.44]  is
[2832.44 --> 2834.00]  that
[2834.00 --> 2836.12]  the struggle
[2836.12 --> 2836.94]  is a sign
[2836.94 --> 2837.88]  of spiritual life.
[2838.66 --> 2839.14]  Okay?
[2839.22 --> 2840.26]  And so consider this.
[2840.82 --> 2841.80]  The reason
[2841.80 --> 2842.70]  that you struggle
[2842.70 --> 2843.28]  with sin
[2843.28 --> 2844.12]  is not because
[2844.12 --> 2844.76]  you're a sinner.
[2844.76 --> 2848.12]  The reason you sin
[2848.12 --> 2849.00]  is because you're a sinner.
[2849.60 --> 2851.06]  The reason you struggle
[2851.06 --> 2851.82]  with sin
[2851.82 --> 2852.52]  is not because
[2852.52 --> 2853.06]  you are a sinner
[2853.06 --> 2854.06]  but because you are
[2854.06 --> 2854.82]  a saint.
[2855.34 --> 2855.46]  Okay?
[2855.48 --> 2856.02]  Do you follow me?
[2857.48 --> 2858.92]  The reason you struggle
[2858.92 --> 2859.64]  with sin
[2859.64 --> 2860.22]  is because
[2860.22 --> 2861.26]  you love God.
[2863.02 --> 2863.36]  You know,
[2863.40 --> 2864.50]  one of my favorite hymns
[2864.50 --> 2865.82]  is Be Thou My Vision.
[2866.46 --> 2866.84]  You know,
[2866.90 --> 2867.60]  a lot of us
[2867.60 --> 2868.72]  are familiar with it
[2868.72 --> 2869.54]  and one of the verses
[2869.54 --> 2870.14]  of the hymn
[2870.14 --> 2871.14]  says this.
[2871.14 --> 2874.36]  Prone to wander,
[2874.64 --> 2874.88]  Lord,
[2875.00 --> 2875.78]  I feel it.
[2876.00 --> 2877.14]  Prone to leave
[2877.14 --> 2878.14]  the God
[2878.14 --> 2879.22]  I love.
[2880.72 --> 2881.28]  Right?
[2881.42 --> 2882.34]  A person
[2882.34 --> 2883.88]  who doesn't love God
[2883.88 --> 2885.26]  doesn't sing that.
[2887.26 --> 2887.40]  You know,
[2887.48 --> 2888.86]  are there times
[2888.86 --> 2889.32]  when
[2889.32 --> 2890.86]  we are prone
[2890.86 --> 2891.36]  to wander
[2891.36 --> 2892.02]  and leave the God
[2892.02 --> 2892.44]  we love?
[2892.88 --> 2893.52]  For me,
[2893.74 --> 2894.04]  yes.
[2895.14 --> 2896.06]  And I'm sure
[2896.06 --> 2897.02]  for you as well.
[2897.02 --> 2898.92]  And yet,
[2898.98 --> 2899.68]  there's also something
[2899.68 --> 2900.38]  in our hearts
[2900.38 --> 2901.28]  where we say,
[2901.40 --> 2901.60]  God,
[2901.66 --> 2902.54]  I do love you.
[2903.30 --> 2904.74]  I want to honor you
[2904.74 --> 2905.38]  in my life.
[2905.46 --> 2906.24]  I want to live
[2906.24 --> 2907.02]  a holy life.
[2907.28 --> 2908.40]  Help me to do so.
[2908.84 --> 2909.56]  I need help.
[2909.74 --> 2910.34]  I can't do it
[2910.34 --> 2911.32]  on my own.
[2912.64 --> 2912.92]  And so,
[2913.00 --> 2913.62]  the only reason
[2913.62 --> 2914.44]  that you can say
[2914.44 --> 2915.42]  these things
[2915.42 --> 2916.04]  is that
[2916.04 --> 2917.46]  it's because
[2917.46 --> 2918.52]  of the Holy Spirit
[2918.52 --> 2919.92]  that has made you
[2919.92 --> 2920.68]  alive to God.
[2921.30 --> 2921.90]  If the Holy Spirit
[2921.90 --> 2922.68]  has not made you
[2922.68 --> 2923.18]  alive to God,
[2923.24 --> 2923.84]  you cannot say,
[2924.52 --> 2925.40]  you cannot lament
[2925.40 --> 2926.54]  that you are prone
[2926.54 --> 2927.52]  to leave God.
[2927.62 --> 2928.18]  You don't care.
[2928.84 --> 2929.32]  Right?
[2931.18 --> 2931.66]  So,
[2931.74 --> 2932.34]  if you struggle
[2932.34 --> 2932.80]  with sin,
[2932.86 --> 2933.34]  it's not because
[2933.34 --> 2934.46]  you're not a true Christian.
[2934.84 --> 2935.72]  It's actually a sign
[2935.72 --> 2936.78]  that you are a Christian.
[2937.70 --> 2939.14]  If you are horrified
[2939.14 --> 2939.96]  by your sin,
[2940.88 --> 2942.10]  that is the Holy Spirit
[2942.10 --> 2943.18]  convicting you of sin.
[2944.50 --> 2946.18]  And we're always struggling
[2946.18 --> 2947.84]  because we are always
[2947.84 --> 2949.04]  being made new.
[2949.20 --> 2949.98]  It's a process.
[2950.74 --> 2950.84]  Right?
[2950.88 --> 2951.52]  The old things
[2951.52 --> 2952.62]  are passing away.
[2952.96 --> 2953.62]  It is hard
[2953.62 --> 2954.56]  to rip off
[2954.56 --> 2955.46]  the old things.
[2956.64 --> 2957.74]  Sin remains in me
[2957.74 --> 2958.70]  but is not the boss
[2958.70 --> 2959.44]  of me anymore.
[2960.24 --> 2961.50]  I have a new master.
[2962.94 --> 2963.20]  And so,
[2963.28 --> 2964.02]  inside of us
[2964.02 --> 2965.62]  is this growing affection
[2965.62 --> 2966.48]  for the one
[2966.48 --> 2968.04]  who gave his life
[2968.04 --> 2968.76]  for us.
[2969.96 --> 2970.66]  And non-Christians
[2970.66 --> 2971.22]  don't struggle
[2971.22 --> 2971.90]  to love God
[2971.90 --> 2972.60]  and obey him.
[2972.88 --> 2973.52]  Christians do.
[2975.34 --> 2975.78]  And so,
[2975.78 --> 2976.08]  sometimes,
[2976.20 --> 2976.28]  you know,
[2976.32 --> 2976.98]  the very things
[2976.98 --> 2977.74]  that we chalk up
[2977.74 --> 2978.94]  to having bad
[2978.94 --> 2979.90]  spiritual health,
[2980.00 --> 2980.12]  right,
[2980.14 --> 2980.98]  our struggle with sin,
[2981.20 --> 2981.62]  actually,
[2981.70 --> 2982.60]  it could be a sign
[2982.60 --> 2983.42]  of spiritual growth
[2983.42 --> 2984.00]  and progress.
[2985.36 --> 2985.92]  And so,
[2986.00 --> 2986.80]  struggle is normal
[2986.80 --> 2987.58]  for those who are
[2987.58 --> 2988.48]  growing in Jesus.
[2988.94 --> 2989.14]  So,
[2989.20 --> 2989.82]  when you struggle,
[2989.96 --> 2990.62]  be encouraged.
[2991.54 --> 2992.34]  It's a sign
[2992.34 --> 2993.18]  of spiritual life.
[2993.78 --> 2994.70]  And that leads us
[2994.70 --> 2995.56]  to the third thing
[2995.56 --> 2996.58]  that we learn
[2996.58 --> 2997.68]  about the struggle
[2997.68 --> 2998.08]  with sin.
[2998.58 --> 2999.66]  And that is,
[2999.82 --> 3000.28]  the struggle,
[3000.38 --> 3001.52]  it's a call to fight.
[3002.16 --> 3003.06]  It's a call to actually
[3003.06 --> 3004.38]  enter into the battle.
[3005.04 --> 3005.44]  So,
[3005.52 --> 3006.46]  the struggle with sin
[3006.46 --> 3007.08]  is normal
[3007.08 --> 3008.84]  but don't make peace
[3008.84 --> 3009.36]  with it.
[3010.24 --> 3011.12]  Just because you're
[3011.12 --> 3011.50]  going to struggle
[3011.50 --> 3011.84]  with sin,
[3011.90 --> 3012.32]  that doesn't mean,
[3012.32 --> 3012.62]  well,
[3012.76 --> 3013.58]  throw up your hands
[3013.58 --> 3014.04]  and say,
[3014.24 --> 3014.50]  okay,
[3014.70 --> 3015.08]  you know,
[3015.44 --> 3015.96]  so I'm not going
[3015.96 --> 3016.36]  to bother.
[3017.36 --> 3017.54]  Right?
[3017.58 --> 3018.10]  Don't use it
[3018.10 --> 3018.74]  as an excuse
[3018.74 --> 3019.40]  to be like this
[3019.40 --> 3020.26]  crazy guy,
[3020.32 --> 3020.58]  you know,
[3020.64 --> 3021.14]  who's like coming
[3021.14 --> 3021.64]  into church
[3021.64 --> 3022.64]  and whacking people
[3022.64 --> 3023.10]  in the head
[3023.10 --> 3023.90]  with hymnals.
[3025.50 --> 3026.42]  That's just an example
[3026.42 --> 3027.16]  I heard of someone
[3027.16 --> 3028.20]  who used to do that
[3028.20 --> 3028.50]  apparently.
[3029.38 --> 3029.74]  So,
[3029.84 --> 3030.68]  you can't come in here
[3030.68 --> 3031.38]  and just be like,
[3032.00 --> 3032.20]  hey,
[3032.30 --> 3033.32]  that's just me,
[3033.42 --> 3033.62]  you know,
[3033.72 --> 3034.12]  I'm just,
[3034.18 --> 3034.90]  that's who I am,
[3035.00 --> 3035.72]  I'm just a hymnal
[3035.72 --> 3036.06]  whacker,
[3037.12 --> 3037.46]  you know,
[3037.56 --> 3038.26]  it's what I do.
[3038.26 --> 3038.82]  No,
[3040.10 --> 3040.80]  that's not our
[3040.80 --> 3042.06]  response to sin
[3042.06 --> 3043.02]  and I'm not saying
[3043.02 --> 3043.74]  that person was
[3043.74 --> 3044.48]  sinning when they,
[3044.84 --> 3045.06]  whatever,
[3045.18 --> 3045.76]  it's just an example.
[3046.40 --> 3046.60]  Okay?
[3046.68 --> 3047.36]  You can't just be like,
[3047.44 --> 3048.56]  I'm a hymnal whacker,
[3048.62 --> 3049.26]  I'm going to whack people
[3049.26 --> 3049.86]  and that's like,
[3050.02 --> 3050.60]  you got to be okay
[3050.60 --> 3050.90]  with that.
[3050.98 --> 3051.12]  No,
[3051.42 --> 3052.16]  sin is terrible
[3052.16 --> 3053.72]  and we are to hate
[3053.72 --> 3054.28]  our sin.
[3055.34 --> 3055.48]  Right?
[3055.52 --> 3055.68]  So,
[3055.76 --> 3056.28]  it's not an excuse
[3056.28 --> 3057.10]  to be lazy
[3057.10 --> 3058.92]  about it
[3058.92 --> 3059.76]  or to give up
[3059.76 --> 3060.22]  the fight.
[3061.24 --> 3061.46]  And so,
[3061.58 --> 3062.22]  Paul's language
[3062.22 --> 3063.50]  in this passage
[3063.50 --> 3064.22]  in general,
[3064.32 --> 3064.52]  it's just,
[3064.60 --> 3065.74]  it's fighting language,
[3065.90 --> 3066.86]  it's struggling language,
[3066.86 --> 3068.78]  it's not surrendering language,
[3069.36 --> 3071.40]  it's keep fighting sin
[3071.40 --> 3072.10]  in your life.
[3073.54 --> 3073.70]  You know,
[3073.74 --> 3074.70]  Paul says elsewhere
[3074.70 --> 3075.92]  in the book of Colossians,
[3076.18 --> 3076.48]  he says,
[3076.76 --> 3077.82]  put to death
[3077.82 --> 3079.60]  what is earthly in you.
[3080.62 --> 3080.74]  Okay?
[3080.78 --> 3081.50]  Put to death.
[3081.64 --> 3082.12]  That's like,
[3082.54 --> 3083.98]  very much of struggle
[3083.98 --> 3085.86]  or to put sin to death.
[3088.00 --> 3088.98]  And one of the ways
[3088.98 --> 3089.74]  that we do that
[3089.74 --> 3091.66]  is the fourth point.
[3091.92 --> 3092.64]  The fourth thing
[3092.64 --> 3093.74]  we learn from this passage
[3093.74 --> 3095.80]  is to be honest
[3095.80 --> 3097.62]  with our struggle
[3097.62 --> 3098.34]  with sin.
[3098.88 --> 3099.48]  Be honest.
[3099.56 --> 3100.20]  Don't hide it.
[3101.28 --> 3102.22]  And my point here
[3102.22 --> 3102.82]  is very simple
[3102.82 --> 3103.30]  that, you know,
[3103.36 --> 3104.48]  as a church family,
[3105.12 --> 3107.20]  we don't want to
[3107.20 --> 3108.52]  have a family
[3108.52 --> 3109.80]  where there is hypocrisy
[3109.80 --> 3111.10]  and lying
[3111.10 --> 3111.98]  and pretending.
[3113.28 --> 3113.72]  You know,
[3113.76 --> 3114.52]  because sometimes
[3114.52 --> 3115.50]  the church can be
[3115.50 --> 3116.48]  a hard place
[3116.48 --> 3117.14]  for people
[3117.14 --> 3117.62]  who sense
[3117.62 --> 3118.34]  they are failures.
[3119.34 --> 3119.80]  Right?
[3119.84 --> 3120.48]  We don't want
[3120.48 --> 3120.90]  the church
[3120.90 --> 3122.40]  to be a place
[3122.40 --> 3123.36]  where people
[3123.36 --> 3124.12]  who feel
[3124.12 --> 3124.88]  they are failures
[3124.88 --> 3125.36]  feel like
[3125.36 --> 3126.02]  they can't belong
[3126.02 --> 3126.78]  because we are,
[3126.98 --> 3127.92]  we actually
[3127.92 --> 3129.18]  are all failures.
[3130.08 --> 3131.02]  And so you might
[3131.02 --> 3131.82]  be here this morning
[3131.82 --> 3132.48]  and you might look
[3132.48 --> 3132.90]  at the people
[3132.90 --> 3133.54]  around you
[3133.54 --> 3134.16]  and say,
[3134.28 --> 3134.36]  well,
[3134.40 --> 3135.16]  I bet they don't
[3135.16 --> 3136.02]  struggle with sin.
[3136.52 --> 3137.40]  They look like
[3137.40 --> 3138.46]  they have it all together.
[3139.90 --> 3141.14]  But they are struggling.
[3141.62 --> 3141.80]  Right?
[3142.04 --> 3143.10]  If you just scratch
[3143.10 --> 3143.62]  the surface
[3143.62 --> 3144.52]  just a little bit,
[3145.10 --> 3145.94]  there's a lot
[3145.94 --> 3146.90]  going on
[3146.90 --> 3147.96]  in everybody's heart.
[3148.86 --> 3149.86]  We're all struggling
[3149.86 --> 3150.22]  with sin
[3150.22 --> 3150.68]  in one way
[3150.68 --> 3151.10]  or another
[3151.10 --> 3152.54]  or in lots of ways.
[3154.14 --> 3154.84]  And so let's
[3154.84 --> 3155.32]  take our lead
[3155.32 --> 3155.74]  from Paul.
[3155.82 --> 3156.52]  What does Paul do?
[3156.96 --> 3157.82]  The Apostle Paul,
[3157.94 --> 3158.02]  right,
[3158.08 --> 3158.54]  one of the most,
[3158.88 --> 3159.80]  foremost Christians
[3159.80 --> 3160.60]  who ever lived
[3160.60 --> 3162.06]  can admit
[3162.06 --> 3163.42]  his struggle
[3163.42 --> 3163.90]  with sin
[3163.90 --> 3164.42]  in his heart.
[3164.52 --> 3165.00]  He admitted
[3165.00 --> 3165.56]  last week
[3165.56 --> 3166.08]  his struggle
[3166.08 --> 3167.34]  with covetousness.
[3168.22 --> 3169.06]  And he says
[3169.06 --> 3169.46]  that he is
[3169.46 --> 3170.22]  a wretched man.
[3171.44 --> 3172.12]  And so if he
[3172.12 --> 3172.78]  can do that
[3172.78 --> 3173.26]  and if he can
[3173.26 --> 3173.66]  admit that
[3173.66 --> 3174.66]  to the whole world
[3174.66 --> 3176.30]  in sacred scripture,
[3176.96 --> 3177.32]  you know,
[3177.32 --> 3179.18]  I think we can confide
[3179.18 --> 3180.44]  to one or two friends
[3180.44 --> 3182.40]  of our struggles
[3182.40 --> 3183.26]  and ask for prayer
[3183.26 --> 3184.30]  and ask for help.
[3184.80 --> 3184.92]  Okay,
[3184.92 --> 3185.56]  we can be honest
[3185.56 --> 3186.22]  with our struggle
[3186.22 --> 3187.18]  with sin.
[3189.08 --> 3190.20]  And the last thing
[3190.20 --> 3190.74]  is this,
[3191.50 --> 3193.96]  that the struggle
[3193.96 --> 3195.54]  actually means
[3195.54 --> 3196.56]  a life of dependence.
[3197.60 --> 3197.72]  Okay,
[3197.74 --> 3198.16]  it means a life
[3198.16 --> 3198.64]  of dependence.
[3199.42 --> 3200.60]  What does Paul say
[3200.60 --> 3201.38]  in verse 24?
[3202.46 --> 3203.08]  He says,
[3203.08 --> 3205.32]  what a wretched man
[3205.32 --> 3205.82]  I am
[3205.82 --> 3207.60]  who will rescue me
[3207.60 --> 3208.68]  from this body
[3208.68 --> 3209.22]  that is subject
[3209.22 --> 3209.76]  to death.
[3210.72 --> 3211.28]  He's saying
[3211.28 --> 3212.82]  I need rescue
[3212.82 --> 3214.36]  because I can't
[3214.36 --> 3215.20]  rescue myself.
[3215.90 --> 3216.88]  It's a cry
[3216.88 --> 3218.18]  of dependence.
[3218.44 --> 3219.66]  Who will rescue me?
[3220.20 --> 3221.34]  Who will save me?
[3222.82 --> 3223.94]  And what that means
[3223.94 --> 3224.92]  is you can't
[3224.92 --> 3225.90]  just clean up
[3225.90 --> 3226.40]  your act.
[3226.88 --> 3227.38]  You can't just
[3227.38 --> 3228.08]  walk right,
[3228.90 --> 3229.06]  right,
[3229.86 --> 3230.58]  shape up,
[3230.96 --> 3231.58]  read your Bibles
[3231.58 --> 3232.40]  and go to church more.
[3233.74 --> 3234.70]  That's not the answer.
[3235.14 --> 3236.26]  We can't save ourselves.
[3236.44 --> 3237.68]  We need a deliverer.
[3239.24 --> 3239.44]  You know,
[3239.46 --> 3240.38]  a number of years ago
[3240.38 --> 3241.26]  on the Tonight Show
[3241.26 --> 3241.88]  with Jay Leno,
[3242.00 --> 3243.06]  there was an opera singer
[3243.06 --> 3244.16]  who came onto the show
[3244.16 --> 3244.70]  as a guest.
[3245.10 --> 3246.16]  And this opera singer
[3246.16 --> 3247.36]  had an amazing
[3247.36 --> 3248.30]  tenor voice.
[3248.98 --> 3249.94]  And he sang
[3249.94 --> 3250.86]  Amazing Grace.
[3251.56 --> 3251.82]  You know,
[3251.88 --> 3252.56]  and so I watched
[3252.56 --> 3253.26]  this clip on YouTube
[3253.26 --> 3253.80]  and I was like,
[3253.88 --> 3254.08]  wow,
[3254.16 --> 3254.86]  this is great.
[3255.26 --> 3255.98]  Here's this guy
[3255.98 --> 3256.56]  on this, you know,
[3256.62 --> 3257.56]  non-Christian show.
[3257.74 --> 3258.32]  He's going to sing
[3258.32 --> 3259.18]  Amazing Grace.
[3260.22 --> 3261.42]  But he started singing
[3261.42 --> 3262.64]  and he sang these words.
[3264.06 --> 3265.02]  Amazing Grace,
[3265.10 --> 3266.26]  how sweet the sound
[3266.26 --> 3267.82]  that saved a soul
[3267.82 --> 3269.20]  like me.
[3272.70 --> 3274.08]  I was horrified.
[3274.08 --> 3274.16]  Right?
[3276.00 --> 3277.86]  The song doesn't make sense
[3277.86 --> 3279.96]  that saved a soul
[3279.96 --> 3280.44]  like me.
[3281.26 --> 3281.50]  Right?
[3281.52 --> 3283.14]  The gospel does not make sense
[3283.14 --> 3284.36]  if you do not view yourself
[3284.36 --> 3284.86]  as what?
[3285.54 --> 3286.42]  The saved a
[3286.42 --> 3287.76]  wretch
[3287.76 --> 3288.96]  like me.
[3290.74 --> 3291.26]  Right?
[3291.30 --> 3292.86]  If you don't see your person,
[3293.14 --> 3293.52]  yourself,
[3293.68 --> 3294.16]  as a person
[3294.16 --> 3295.66]  who has a desperate
[3295.66 --> 3297.48]  need for grace,
[3297.48 --> 3299.40]  what a wretched man
[3299.40 --> 3300.06]  that I am,
[3300.10 --> 3300.66]  then the gospel
[3300.66 --> 3303.26]  isn't powerful.
[3304.60 --> 3305.34]  So how does Paul
[3305.34 --> 3306.00]  then respond
[3306.00 --> 3306.88]  when he sees himself
[3306.88 --> 3308.06]  as a wretch
[3308.06 --> 3310.08]  who can't rescue himself?
[3310.22 --> 3311.38]  He doesn't respond
[3311.38 --> 3312.76]  with despair,
[3313.64 --> 3313.90]  right?
[3313.94 --> 3315.60]  Or with self-loathing
[3315.60 --> 3317.46]  or with self-condemnation.
[3318.54 --> 3318.82]  You know,
[3318.88 --> 3319.76]  he's not just like,
[3319.90 --> 3320.22]  you know,
[3320.62 --> 3321.28]  he doesn't say,
[3321.62 --> 3322.32]  what a wretched man,
[3322.46 --> 3323.22]  what a wretched man,
[3323.38 --> 3324.18]  what a wretched man.
[3324.24 --> 3324.64]  And that's the end
[3324.64 --> 3325.10]  of the song.
[3325.38 --> 3325.60]  No,
[3325.68 --> 3327.04]  he says in verse 25,
[3328.20 --> 3329.46]  thanks be to God
[3329.46 --> 3331.84]  who delivers me
[3331.84 --> 3332.94]  through Jesus Christ
[3332.94 --> 3333.44]  our Lord.
[3334.16 --> 3335.66]  He responds with worship.
[3336.50 --> 3337.76]  He responds with
[3337.76 --> 3339.20]  doxology,
[3339.44 --> 3340.06]  with dependence.
[3341.12 --> 3341.80]  Because friends,
[3341.86 --> 3342.94]  we have a deliverer.
[3344.20 --> 3344.88]  In other words,
[3344.94 --> 3345.76]  we are saved,
[3345.96 --> 3347.30]  we are saved
[3347.30 --> 3348.30]  by perfect obedience
[3348.30 --> 3348.86]  to the law.
[3348.96 --> 3349.50]  Did you know that?
[3350.44 --> 3351.36]  Just not ours.
[3352.58 --> 3353.54]  We are saved
[3353.54 --> 3354.72]  by perfect obedience
[3354.72 --> 3356.10]  to the law,
[3356.44 --> 3357.16]  but clearly not
[3357.16 --> 3358.16]  our perfect obedience,
[3358.88 --> 3360.44]  but the perfect obedience
[3360.44 --> 3362.46]  of Jesus Christ,
[3362.54 --> 3363.60]  our deliverer,
[3364.14 --> 3365.86]  which is accredited to us.
[3367.26 --> 3368.16]  So as we close,
[3368.22 --> 3368.72]  let me ask you
[3368.72 --> 3369.72]  a really important question,
[3370.44 --> 3371.10]  which is,
[3371.36 --> 3372.86]  what sustains you
[3372.86 --> 3373.82]  in this struggle?
[3375.04 --> 3376.62]  What sustains you
[3376.62 --> 3377.90]  to keep fighting sin,
[3377.98 --> 3379.24]  to actually want to grow
[3379.24 --> 3380.12]  in the Christian life?
[3380.18 --> 3380.52]  It's not,
[3380.72 --> 3381.84]  it doesn't come naturally.
[3382.02 --> 3383.12]  It's not easy.
[3383.60 --> 3384.42]  It's a struggle.
[3384.66 --> 3385.96]  Paul calls it a race
[3385.96 --> 3389.02]  or a fight,
[3389.68 --> 3390.08]  wrestling.
[3390.22 --> 3391.24]  He uses all these images.
[3392.58 --> 3392.72]  Right?
[3392.80 --> 3393.64]  And so I'm sure
[3393.64 --> 3394.80]  it is no surprise to you
[3394.80 --> 3396.84]  that you mess up
[3396.84 --> 3397.86]  sometimes,
[3397.86 --> 3399.76]  that you disappoint yourself,
[3400.08 --> 3401.22]  that you don't have
[3401.22 --> 3401.88]  it all together.
[3402.72 --> 3403.72]  So what sustains you
[3403.72 --> 3404.24]  in the battle?
[3404.32 --> 3405.18]  What gives you courage?
[3406.18 --> 3406.72]  And hopefully,
[3406.92 --> 3407.74]  it is this truth,
[3407.96 --> 3409.10]  that though sin
[3409.10 --> 3410.52]  does have a grip on you,
[3411.40 --> 3413.06]  Christ has a grip
[3413.06 --> 3413.74]  on you as well.
[3415.74 --> 3416.70]  And his grip
[3416.70 --> 3418.06]  is eternal.
[3419.04 --> 3419.90]  And his grip
[3419.90 --> 3420.84]  is far
[3420.84 --> 3422.02]  more powerful
[3422.02 --> 3423.66]  than any hole
[3423.66 --> 3424.16]  that sin
[3424.16 --> 3425.10]  could have on you,
[3425.14 --> 3426.14]  as strong as that hole
[3426.14 --> 3427.06]  can sometimes feel.
[3427.90 --> 3428.68]  His grip
[3428.68 --> 3430.10]  is stronger.
[3431.08 --> 3431.98]  His delight
[3431.98 --> 3432.66]  is in you,
[3432.74 --> 3433.86]  even as you struggle
[3433.86 --> 3434.54]  against sin,
[3434.54 --> 3435.58]  even as you feel
[3435.58 --> 3436.58]  that you are a failure
[3436.58 --> 3437.18]  in sin.
[3437.60 --> 3438.56]  Jesus delights in you
[3438.56 --> 3439.18]  and he's pouring
[3439.18 --> 3440.24]  out his love
[3440.24 --> 3440.82]  upon you
[3440.82 --> 3441.66]  through Jesus Christ.
[3443.74 --> 3444.40]  And notice
[3444.40 --> 3445.66]  that Paul
[3445.66 --> 3446.50]  knows where
[3446.50 --> 3447.72]  his identity lies.
[3448.68 --> 3449.34]  Look at what he says
[3449.34 --> 3450.00]  in verse 20,
[3450.18 --> 3450.96]  last verse I want
[3450.96 --> 3451.38]  to show you.
[3451.48 --> 3451.84]  He says,
[3452.16 --> 3452.92]  now if I do
[3452.92 --> 3453.72]  what I do not want
[3453.72 --> 3454.04]  to do,
[3454.12 --> 3455.04]  it is no longer I,
[3455.20 --> 3455.62]  Paul,
[3455.84 --> 3456.70]  who do it,
[3456.94 --> 3457.90]  it is sin living
[3457.90 --> 3459.06]  in me that does it.
[3461.02 --> 3461.24]  Right?
[3461.30 --> 3461.74]  So he's saying
[3461.74 --> 3462.70]  the very deepest
[3462.70 --> 3464.16]  part of him,
[3464.26 --> 3466.22]  his true self
[3466.22 --> 3467.52]  that delights
[3467.52 --> 3468.64]  in the law of God,
[3469.10 --> 3470.58]  his self that belongs
[3470.58 --> 3471.86]  now to Jesus Christ
[3471.86 --> 3473.06]  and that knows
[3473.06 --> 3474.20]  that he is loved
[3474.20 --> 3475.68]  even when he screws up.
[3475.78 --> 3476.78]  That is who he is.
[3477.92 --> 3478.58]  That's the thing
[3478.58 --> 3479.60]  that defines him.
[3479.90 --> 3480.76]  Not that he is
[3480.76 --> 3481.32]  a wretched man.
[3481.38 --> 3482.14]  He's not defined
[3482.14 --> 3483.06]  by his sin,
[3483.42 --> 3484.36]  but he's defined
[3484.36 --> 3485.64]  by belonging to Christ.
[3487.84 --> 3489.50]  So I heard this week
[3489.50 --> 3490.44]  this true story
[3490.44 --> 3490.96]  of a guy
[3490.96 --> 3492.12]  who was in the army
[3492.12 --> 3494.22]  and the story
[3494.22 --> 3495.18]  is told by a chaplain
[3495.18 --> 3496.42]  who was embedded
[3496.42 --> 3497.40]  with the troops
[3497.40 --> 3497.96]  of this army
[3497.96 --> 3498.78]  and he said
[3498.78 --> 3499.90]  that on their last day
[3499.90 --> 3500.76]  of their deployment
[3500.76 --> 3503.42]  they were marching
[3503.42 --> 3504.52]  and they walked
[3504.52 --> 3505.22]  into an ambush
[3505.22 --> 3507.14]  and the first guy
[3507.14 --> 3507.78]  in the group
[3507.78 --> 3508.42]  who was kind of
[3508.42 --> 3509.14]  the point man,
[3509.32 --> 3510.14]  he got hit
[3510.14 --> 3511.52]  by an enemy sniper
[3511.52 --> 3513.70]  and whatever kind
[3513.70 --> 3514.88]  of caliber gun
[3514.88 --> 3515.66]  this thing was,
[3515.72 --> 3516.64]  it was pretty impressive
[3516.64 --> 3518.12]  because the round
[3518.12 --> 3519.18]  hit him in the chest
[3519.18 --> 3520.18]  and it knocked him
[3520.18 --> 3521.48]  back several feet
[3521.48 --> 3522.62]  where he just fell
[3522.62 --> 3523.22]  onto the ground.
[3523.72 --> 3524.16]  Now of course
[3524.16 --> 3524.62]  in the midst
[3524.62 --> 3525.38]  of that chaos
[3525.38 --> 3526.62]  they assumed
[3526.62 --> 3527.82]  that this is not good,
[3528.58 --> 3528.72]  right,
[3528.76 --> 3529.28]  that probably
[3529.28 --> 3530.16]  they lost this guy
[3530.16 --> 3530.60]  in battle.
[3531.52 --> 3532.28]  And so the chaplain
[3532.28 --> 3533.50]  runs to his side
[3533.50 --> 3535.02]  but he discovers
[3535.02 --> 3535.54]  the soldier
[3535.54 --> 3536.30]  had been wearing
[3536.30 --> 3538.22]  this Kevlar vest
[3538.22 --> 3538.72]  or something,
[3538.82 --> 3538.96]  you know,
[3539.00 --> 3539.58]  super strong
[3539.58 --> 3541.28]  and the bullet
[3541.28 --> 3542.08]  had made a dent
[3542.08 --> 3542.62]  in the armor
[3542.62 --> 3544.92]  but that the armor held.
[3545.92 --> 3546.58]  And when the chaplain
[3546.58 --> 3547.44]  got to his side
[3547.44 --> 3548.12]  the soldier said,
[3548.12 --> 3548.70]  I'm okay,
[3549.04 --> 3549.68]  let's go.
[3550.52 --> 3551.64]  And he jumped up
[3551.64 --> 3552.68]  and he was back
[3552.68 --> 3553.16]  in the fight.
[3554.60 --> 3555.24]  And you know what?
[3555.38 --> 3556.56]  Ephesians chapter 6
[3556.56 --> 3556.96]  says,
[3557.48 --> 3558.18]  what do we have?
[3558.26 --> 3558.96]  The breastplate
[3558.96 --> 3560.56]  of righteousness.
[3561.28 --> 3562.74]  We have the Kevlar
[3562.74 --> 3565.54]  of Christ's righteousness.
[3566.36 --> 3567.54]  That we are protected,
[3567.80 --> 3568.72]  that we are secure.
[3569.46 --> 3570.52]  He is our deliverer
[3570.52 --> 3571.26]  and when Satan
[3571.26 --> 3572.46]  hurls his arrows at us
[3572.46 --> 3573.44]  or when our sin
[3573.44 --> 3575.10]  or when we sin,
[3575.10 --> 3577.06]  the armor holds.
[3577.60 --> 3579.28]  We will not be slain.
[3580.72 --> 3581.54]  And so what do we do then?
[3581.58 --> 3582.74]  When we struggle with sin,
[3582.80 --> 3583.32]  what do we do?
[3583.56 --> 3584.22]  We repent.
[3584.88 --> 3585.94]  We acknowledge it.
[3586.14 --> 3587.18]  We repent to God.
[3587.90 --> 3589.26]  We get back up
[3589.26 --> 3590.20]  because we're okay.
[3591.10 --> 3591.72]  And then we say,
[3591.88 --> 3592.88]  thanks be to God
[3592.88 --> 3595.08]  who has delivered me
[3595.08 --> 3596.26]  through Jesus Christ,
[3596.36 --> 3596.70]  our Lord.
[3598.34 --> 3598.98]  Let's pray.
[3603.98 --> 3604.76]  Father God,
[3605.10 --> 3606.10]  with Paul,
[3606.60 --> 3607.20]  we say,
[3607.60 --> 3609.50]  what a wretched man I am.
[3610.40 --> 3611.78]  Because we struggle with sin
[3611.78 --> 3613.92]  and we are in desperate need
[3613.92 --> 3614.82]  of a deliverer.
[3615.64 --> 3616.04]  But Lord,
[3616.14 --> 3616.76]  we thank you
[3616.76 --> 3617.48]  that you have given us
[3617.48 --> 3618.10]  the Holy Spirit
[3618.10 --> 3619.30]  to help us in this fight
[3619.30 --> 3620.96]  as we abide with you,
[3621.00 --> 3622.30]  as we belong to you.
[3622.90 --> 3623.78]  And you have given us
[3623.78 --> 3625.20]  the righteousness of your Son.
[3625.62 --> 3626.18]  You have given us
[3626.18 --> 3626.98]  a new life
[3626.98 --> 3628.04]  and identity in him.
[3628.16 --> 3629.64]  And so we rejoice
[3629.64 --> 3630.28]  in that, Lord.
[3630.84 --> 3632.20]  And we worship you, Lord.
[3632.20 --> 3632.28]  Lord,
[3632.70 --> 3634.60]  we pray, Lord,
[3634.64 --> 3635.80]  that you would help us
[3635.80 --> 3637.82]  to struggle with sin
[3637.82 --> 3640.24]  until the day
[3640.24 --> 3643.44]  when that indwelling sin
[3643.44 --> 3644.70]  will be completely removed
[3644.70 --> 3645.30]  from us.
[3645.54 --> 3645.84]  And Lord,
[3645.90 --> 3646.76]  we long for that day.
[3647.44 --> 3648.54]  We pray in Jesus' name
[3648.54 --> 3649.44]  and for his sake.
[3649.84 --> 3650.06]  Amen.
[3652.16 --> 3652.96]  Let's stand
[3652.96 --> 3654.06]  and let's sing together.
[3654.06 --> 3654.26]  Amen.
[3654.26 --> 3654.50]  Amen.
[3682.96 --> 3685.88]  and let's sing together.
[3697.88 --> 3698.40]  Amen.
[3700.52 --> 3701.50]  plans and mountain
[3701.50 --> 3704.02]  are fixed upon it
[3704.02 --> 3705.88]  mountain trees
[3706.38 --> 3708.82]  redeeming love
[3708.82 --> 3718.36]  We are with our ebb and laser, hither by thy hand hath come,
[3718.92 --> 3727.32]  and I hope by thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home.
[3728.08 --> 3736.68]  Jesus, Lord, be when a stranger wandereth from the flood of God,
[3736.68 --> 3746.68]  he who rescued me from danger interposes precious blood.
[3747.52 --> 3755.70]  O to grace, how great a death that daily I'm constrained to be,
[3756.22 --> 3764.42]  let that great soul, like a feather, bind my wandering heart to thee.
[3764.42 --> 3773.54]  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to meet the God I love.
[3773.98 --> 3782.28]  In my heart, Lord, take and seal it, seal it for thy cards above.
[3782.28 --> 3783.28]  Amen.
[3783.28 --> 3784.28]  Amen.
[3784.28 --> 3785.28]  Amen.
[3785.28 --> 3786.28]  Amen.
[3786.28 --> 3787.28]  Amen.
[3787.28 --> 3788.28]  Amen.
[3788.28 --> 3789.28]  Amen.
[3789.28 --> 3790.28]  Amen.
[3790.28 --> 3791.28]  Amen.
[3791.28 --> 3792.28]  Amen.
[3792.28 --> 3793.28]  Amen.
[3793.28 --> 3794.28]  Amen.
[3794.28 --> 3794.56]  Amen.
[3795.74 --> 3799.92]  So in our time of worship, we always have a time of response to God's grace.
[3799.92 --> 3802.80]  We respond with singing as we just did.
[3803.68 --> 3806.26]  And another way we respond is in gratitude.
[3807.38 --> 3812.18]  And an expression of that gratitude is simply to acknowledge that everything we have comes from him
[3812.18 --> 3817.72]  and that we give back to him a portion to acknowledge our thankfulness.
[3818.24 --> 3824.14]  If you are a visitor here today, you may give, but please do not feel any compulsion to do so.
[3825.04 --> 3829.48]  And our designated offering today is for the CRC of Sierra Leone.
[3831.06 --> 3838.16]  And so the president of the Sierra Leone CRC, Pastor Moses, he came and he shared about his ministry.
[3838.16 --> 3839.60]  I was able to go and attend.
[3840.08 --> 3844.00]  And he shared about their great need for a vehicle, right?
[3844.02 --> 3845.22]  It's very rough terrain.
[3845.22 --> 3848.50]  There's like mud season and there's villages all over.
[3849.24 --> 3855.86]  And it's very expensive to keep and maintain a vehicle that is able to access all these villages.
[3856.22 --> 3858.16]  And they are in need of a new vehicle.
[3858.78 --> 3865.30]  And so someone from our denomination has put up a $40,000 matching grant.
[3866.12 --> 3868.92]  So however much is raised, they will match up to $40,000.
[3869.80 --> 3871.70]  And, you know, these vehicles are expensive.
[3871.84 --> 3872.76]  They're imported from the UK.
[3872.76 --> 3875.38]  They're going to try to get a new Land Rover.
[3875.96 --> 3876.98]  And so that is the need.
[3877.26 --> 3878.68]  And it's a great cause.
[3878.74 --> 3887.16]  And so we have the privilege of being able to have the opportunity to join in raising funds for this new Land Rover.
[3887.62 --> 3888.68]  So that's our offering.
[3889.56 --> 3892.76]  May I ask our deacons to come forward and collect the offering?
[3892.76 --> 3914.58]  May I ask that?
[3914.82 --> 3915.26]  Would you like that?
[3915.26 --> 3917.26]  Amen.
[3945.26 --> 3947.26]  Amen.
[3975.26 --> 3977.26]  Amen.
[4005.26 --> 4007.26]  Amen.
[4007.26 --> 4009.26]  Amen.
[4009.26 --> 4011.26]  Amen.
[4029.26 --> 4036.66]  So let's join together in prayer as we pray for the needs of some of the needs of the world and of our own congregation.
[4037.60 --> 4038.58]  Let's join in prayer.
[4039.26 --> 4047.98]  O Lord, O Lord, your majestic name fills the earth.
[4048.68 --> 4050.82]  Your glory is higher than the heavens.
[4051.72 --> 4058.58]  You have taught children and infants to tell of your strength, silencing the enemies and all who oppose you.
[4059.46 --> 4065.54]  When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you set in place,
[4065.54 --> 4072.48]  what are mere mortals that you should think of them, human beings that you should care for them?
[4073.26 --> 4077.44]  Yet you made them a little lower than God and crowned them with glory and honor.
[4077.44 --> 4085.98]  You gave them charge of everything you made, putting all things under their authority, the flocks and the herds and all the wild animals,
[4085.98 --> 4092.04]  the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea and everything that swims the ocean currents.
[4092.04 --> 4098.98]  Oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name fills the earth.
[4098.98 --> 4103.48]  And Lord, we marvel at your glory and your majesty.
[4104.20 --> 4108.68]  Especially, Lord, in this summer season, we are amazed at the beauty of your creation,
[4109.40 --> 4116.14]  the flowers, the mountains and the rivers and lakes, the wildlife, and so much more that you have created.
[4116.14 --> 4120.48]  Your majestic name truly fills all the earth.
[4121.30 --> 4123.50]  You are a God so worthy of our praise.
[4124.08 --> 4127.34]  And today we come before you with so much thanksgiving.
[4128.26 --> 4132.14]  We praise and thank you, Lord, for your love and your daily care for us.
[4133.04 --> 4142.34]  And we pray that you would work in us to make us worthy of our calling as caretakers of a wondrous creation.
[4142.34 --> 4151.00]  And we come to you with thanksgiving for our country, for the peace and the freedom that we experience here.
[4151.72 --> 4153.80]  Lord, often we take this for granted.
[4153.98 --> 4157.54]  Help us to remember, Lord, that this is a blessing.
[4158.82 --> 4166.16]  And we pray particularly for the nations of the world who don't experience the peace and freedom that we enjoy.
[4166.16 --> 4173.96]  We pray particularly for Iran and Israel and Ukraine who are experiencing warfare.
[4174.70 --> 4179.40]  Lord, would you give wisdom to leaders and give comfort to those who are suffering.
[4180.06 --> 4181.76]  And we ask, Lord, that peace would prevail.
[4183.12 --> 4186.42]  We pray that you would continue to uphold your church globally.
[4187.38 --> 4191.86]  Lord, we thank you for the ministry that is being done in Sierra Leone through the Christian Reformed Church there.
[4191.86 --> 4201.08]  Lord, we pray for the churches that are being planted and leaders that are being trained.
[4201.46 --> 4207.34]  For schools that teach the children and keep them more out of harm.
[4208.36 --> 4213.72]  We thank you, Lord, for the gospel witness that is being carried out in cities and in remote villages.
[4214.70 --> 4219.52]  And, Lord, would you help your servant, Pastor Moses, as he gives leadership to your church.
[4219.52 --> 4228.64]  Lord, would you provide them a new vehicle that can withstand the rugged terrain and all of the wear and tear that gets put on it.
[4228.68 --> 4232.26]  So that your gospel can go to even the remotest places.
[4233.70 --> 4238.12]  And, Lord, would you also uphold your church not only globally but here, Latin or CRC.
[4238.46 --> 4243.46]  We pray, Lord, that you would continue to knit us together as a congregation.
[4243.92 --> 4246.78]  Lord, would you continue to help us to grow in Christ.
[4247.44 --> 4249.12]  We can't do that on our own.
[4249.52 --> 4256.24]  Lord, bless our preparing for the kids' summer camp next week.
[4256.68 --> 4259.30]  We pray that you would lead many families to attend.
[4260.62 --> 4264.22]  Bless those who are working hard behind the scenes to make it happen.
[4264.50 --> 4267.50]  And, Lord, give us all energy for the task.
[4268.42 --> 4271.88]  As the school year has ended, Lord, we also pray for students and teachers
[4271.88 --> 4276.70]  who are able to take a break from their regular work and studies and routines.
[4277.04 --> 4283.68]  Lord, give them a time of renewal that their minds might be well rested, their bodies rested for the next school year.
[4284.80 --> 4290.60]  Bless all those who will be traveling over this summer break to enjoy time with family or friends.
[4290.60 --> 4298.20]  Bless our relationships and our times that we have together so that our gatherings may bring you honor and praise.
[4299.22 --> 4303.98]  Lord, we thank you for and celebrate with John and Elaine in their 50 years of marriage.
[4304.98 --> 4308.42]  Lord, we know that also this is your gift.
[4308.42 --> 4311.28]  And so we celebrate and we rejoice with them.
[4312.80 --> 4317.00]  Lord, we pray that you will continue to be with those in our midst who are sick.
[4317.64 --> 4318.54]  We pray for Henny.
[4318.88 --> 4319.68]  We pray for Art.
[4320.62 --> 4325.54]  We pray for George, Shirley, Eileen, and others, Lord.
[4325.54 --> 4330.06]  Lord, give them all a deep awareness of your presence and your power.
[4330.92 --> 4339.10]  And we bring all these needs and requests before you in the powerful name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our Rock, and our Redeemer.
[4339.90 --> 4340.26]  Amen.
[4343.62 --> 4344.70]  So let's stand.
[4345.12 --> 4351.32]  And a reminder to stay for cake and coffee.
[4351.64 --> 4353.74]  So that's right through the doors in the Fellowship Hall.
[4353.74 --> 4361.16]  And also, dear church, stretch out your hands to receive the Lord's blessing.
[4362.38 --> 4366.72]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or even imagine,
[4367.28 --> 4370.00]  according to his power that is at work within us,
[4370.48 --> 4377.26]  to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever.
[4377.74 --> 4378.00]  Amen.
[4380.08 --> 4382.56]  Please remain standing and we'll sing our final song.
[4383.74 --> 4407.12]  Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[4407.12 --> 4416.42]  Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[4416.42 --> 4426.42]  Praise Him above, be ye heavenly Lord.
[4426.42 --> 4436.64]  Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[4436.64 --> 4439.42]  Amen.
[4439.42 --> 4440.30]  Amen.
[4441.22 --> 4442.86]  Amen.
[4443.16 --> 4445.56]  Amen.
[4445.56 --> 4446.46]  Amen.
[4447.78 --> 4448.62]  Amen.
[4448.78 --> 4449.78]  Amen.
[4449.78 --> 4449.94]  Amen.
[4449.94 --> 4453.92]  Amen.
[4453.92 --> 4454.94]  Amen.
[4454.94 --> 4456.82]  Amen.
[4459.54 --> 4460.10]  Amen.
[4460.10 --> 4461.78]  Amen.
[4461.78 --> 4462.58]  Amen.
[4462.58 --> 4462.70]  Amen.
[4462.70 --> 4463.70]  Amen.
