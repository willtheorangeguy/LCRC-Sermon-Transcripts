[336.00 → 338.00] Amen.
[338.00 → 340.00] Good morning.
[340.00 → 345.00] My name is Ryan, and I would like to welcome you to Ladder Christian Reformed Church on this
[345.00 → 347.00] fifth Sunday of Lent.
[347.00 → 352.00] We gather here this morning, as we do every Sunday, to worship our Creator, our Redeemer,
[352.00 → 355.00] the one true living God.
[355.00 → 360.00] This morning, Pastor Jason will be concluding our Lenten series in the Book of Lamentations,
[360.00 → 366.00] and Paul Kemp will be leading us in singing God's Praise along with Ashley and Asif away.
[366.00 → 370.00] If you are our guest here this morning, we are very glad to have you, and we invite you
[370.00 → 373.00] to join us after the service for coffee.
[373.00 → 376.00] And if you have young kids, we have a Sunday school program that starts partway through
[376.00 → 380.00] the service, as well as a nursery for any kids under three.
[380.00 → 385.00] And as mentioned last week, this evening at 7pm, in the Fireside Room, we'll be having
[385.00 → 389.00] a special service of Lamentation to conclude our series.
[389.00 → 394.00] This will include scripture and prayer and song, and it's an opportunity to bring the brokenness
[394.00 → 399.00] of the world to God as a community of believers.
[399.00 → 404.00] Now I'd ask you to please stand, if you are able, to join me in a responsive call to worship
[404.00 → 410.00] from Psalm 24.
[410.00 → 426.00] The Lord of the Lord is the Son of the Night, the Lord mighty in battle.
[426.00 → 431.00] Lift your heads, the Lord of the Lord, and lift your heads to your gates.
[431.00 → 432.00] Lift your gates to your doors.
[432.00 → 435.00] Have the King of glory, may you come in.
[435.00 → 438.00] Who is he, this King of glory?
[438.00 → 443.00] The Lord of the Lord Almighty, he is the King of glory.
[443.00 → 444.00] Let us pray.
[444.00 → 451.00] King of glory, our light and our salvation, you are the stronghold of our lives.
[451.00 → 456.00] We come this morning with an offering of broken and contrite hearts.
[456.00 → 462.00] Open our lips, Lord, that our mouths may declare your mighty deeds in word and song.
[462.00 → 463.00] Amen.
[463.00 → 469.00] Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven
[469.00 → 474.00] spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn
[474.00 → 478.00] of the dead, and the ruler of the kings on earth.
[478.00 → 484.00] To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom,
[484.00 → 490.00] priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[490.00 → 492.00] Amen.
[492.00 → 494.00] Let us take a moment to greet each other in fellowship.
[520.00 → 525.00] Great to hear all the greeting.
[525.00 → 527.00] We'll turn ourselves as an assembly to a song of praise.
[527.00 → 530.00] And this song has one of my favourite phrases of praise in it because I think it's a wonderful
[530.00 → 532.00] picture, especially when it's a song of praise.
[532.00 → 535.00] Especially at this time of year with flowers growing in it.
[535.00 → 537.00] Where at the reads sunset when it so we're not together, we won't talk about.
[537.00 → 541.00] You know and hover and mirrors that it выступ in the village, and when it's the target
[541.00 → 546.00] of eternal death, we turn it down to a song of praise.
[546.00 → 550.00] That it may begun of amen, we'll be here to our master to our master.
[550.00 → 558.82] This song has one of my favourite phrases of praise in it because I think it's a wonderful picture, especially at this time of year with flowers growing.
[559.04 → 564.30] And it says, hearts unfold like flowers before the opening to the sun above.
[564.40 → 575.82] And as the flowers follow the sun during the day, we want to mimic that and open ourselves, give everything we have to the Lord for he made us.
[576.30 → 578.00] And we want to glorify him.
[578.00 → 580.74] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[590.34 → 599.12] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord above.
[599.12 → 608.12] Your tongue unfold like flowers before thee, opening to the sun above.
[609.02 → 617.12] Build the clouds of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away.
[617.12 → 628.30] Give her of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.
[628.30 → 638.40] All thy works with joy store round the earth and heaven, they flag the hills.
[638.78 → 647.76] Lord, can angels sing your own, the centre of unbroken place?
[647.76 → 657.24] Field and forest, field and mountains, glory mellow flashing sea.
[657.24 → 667.58] Chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in thee.
[667.58 → 677.58] Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed.
[677.58 → 687.00] Thou spring of the joy of living, ocean depth of life be rest.
[687.00 → 696.00] Thou our Father, Christ our Father, all who live in love are God.
[696.00 → 699.40] lest plant, I'd artists love could be rest.
[699.40 → 708.14] Come to love in love, lift us with pride.
[708.14 → 708.78] そして Maria, let sensitive承え大ис Hey, ー.
[708.78 → 712.48] Lord, hisских日本, eta' ог all the light he road.
[712.48 → 725.74] For us, with the morning stars we gather, Father, love is waiting for us, brother, love
[725.74 → 749.92] I plan to have ever singing largely onward, winters in the midst of strife, joyful music is a summer in the triumphs of all the fight.
[755.74 → 777.60] The light of new world, you step down into darkness, open my eyes, let me see.
[777.60 → 789.60] Beauty that made it is hard, adore you, hope of the life spent with you.
[789.60 → 802.60] Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[803.60 → 813.60] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to be.
[813.60 → 829.60] King of all days, oh so highly exalted, glorious in heaven above.
[829.60 → 831.60] Oh, I'm so glad you're my God.
[831.60 → 840.60] Only you made to the earth and created, all for love's sake became poor.
[840.60 → 854.60] Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[854.60 → 866.60] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to be.
[866.60 → 877.78] I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.
[877.78 → 889.84] I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross.
[889.84 → 901.84] So here I am to worship, here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my God.
[901.84 → 912.84] You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to be.
[914.84 → 916.68] You make the same.
[919.84 → 926.84] You make the same.
[926.84 → 931.84] Our first scripture this reading this morning comes from John 11 verses 28 through 37.
[932.84 → 937.84] After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside.
[937.84 → 941.84] The teacher is here, she said, and she is asking for you.
[941.84 → 944.84] When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
[944.84 → 949.84] Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
[949.84 → 957.84] When the Jews who had been at Mary's house comforting her had noticed how quickly she got up and went out,
[957.84 → 961.84] they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to mourn.
[961.84 → 967.84] When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said,
[967.84 → 972.84] Lord, if you had been here, my brother would have not died.
[972.84 → 979.84] When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
[979.84 → 981.84] Where have you laid him?
[981.84 → 982.84] He asked.
[982.84 → 985.84] Come and see, Lord, they replied.
[985.84 → 987.84] Jesus wept.
[987.84 → 991.84] Then the Jews said, see how he loved them.
[991.84 → 999.84] But some of them said, could not he who opened the eyes of a blind man have kept this man from dying?
[999.84 → 1001.84] This is the word of the Lord.
[1001.84 → 1004.84] Thanks be to God.
[1004.84 → 1008.84] As we come to our time of confession this morning, Jason and I both happened to pick scriptures,
[1008.84 → 1014.84] readings dealing with death and its finality on earth and its eternity in heaven.
[1014.84 → 1022.84] As we continue in Luke 16, there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
[1022.84 → 1030.84] At his gate laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table.
[1030.84 → 1034.84] Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[1034.84 → 1039.84] The time came when the beggar had died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.
[1039.84 → 1042.84] The rich man also died and was buried.
[1042.84 → 1049.84] In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.
[1049.84 → 1058.84] So he called to him, Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in the water and cool my tongue,
[1058.84 → 1061.84] because I am in agony in this fire.
[1061.84 → 1063.84] But Abraham replied,
[1063.84 → 1069.84] Son, remember that in your lifetime you received good things while Lazarus received bad things.
[1069.84 → 1073.84] But now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
[1073.84 → 1079.84] And besides all of this, between us and you, a great chasm has been set in place,
[1079.84 → 1086.84] so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone pass over from there to us.
[1086.84 → 1087.84] He answered,
[1087.84 → 1091.84] Then I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.
[1091.84 → 1096.84] Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
[1096.84 → 1097.84] Abraham replied,
[1097.84 → 1101.84] They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.
[1101.84 → 1107.84] No, Father Abraham, he said, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.
[1107.84 → 1117.84] He said to them, if they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not even be convinced, even if someone rises from the dead.
[1117.84 → 1120.84] Even if someone rises from the dead.
[1120.84 → 1122.84] These are the words of Jesus himself.
[1122.84 → 1126.84] And I think this last line is especially poignant as we look towards Easter.
[1126.84 → 1132.84] Last week we heard about the need to put God first in our lives rather than to trust in idols.
[1132.84 → 1141.84] Once again we hear of a man putting his trust in fine purple robes and leaving the word of God as a distant afterthought.
[1141.84 → 1145.84] The rich man knew the scriptures, as did his five brothers.
[1145.84 → 1150.84] And yet he made a decision every morning to put his trust in wealth and comfort.
[1150.84 → 1157.84] Jesus tells us that there will come a time in everyone's life when we will be making this decision for the final time.
[1157.84 → 1159.84] After that, we're locked in.
[1159.84 → 1163.84] We are told in Matthew 25 that no one can know the hour.
[1163.84 → 1172.84] So rather than hold out hope for an opportunity for a deathbed confession, God calls us to live a discipleship in Christ.
[1172.84 → 1176.84] Yes, God's kingdom work is a discipline.
[1176.84 → 1185.84] Sin draws us towards evil every day, just as the rich man, just as it did to the rich man as he crossed his gate, stepping over Lazarus.
[1185.84 → 1190.84] But giving ourselves over to God rather than wealth means seeking out justice and mercy.
[1190.84 → 1196.84] It means we serve others as the servant king served others during his time on earth.
[1196.84 → 1200.84] Let us pray then for God's guidance.
[1200.84 → 1207.84] Heavenly Father, teach us to number our days that we may turn our hearts unto wisdom.
[1207.84 → 1216.84] Help us daily to reject sin and selfishness and instead be clothed in your righteousness.
[1216.84 → 1223.84] May we follow in the footsteps of your son, Jesus, who led a perfect life, yet died the death our sins deserve.
[1223.84 → 1228.84] Gather us to wash the feet of the poor and the downtrodden.
[1228.84 → 1232.84] Help us to reject the temptations that wealth and comfort provide.
[1232.84 → 1237.84] Take our hands to serve you, the one true master of our lives.
[1237.84 → 1242.84] We ask this all in your powerful name. Amen.
[1242.84 → 1254.84] Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life as clear as crystal flowing from the throne of God and of the lamb down the middle of a great street in the city.
[1254.84 → 1261.84] On each side of the river stood the tree of life bearing twelve crops of fruit yielding its fruit every month.
[1261.84 → 1265.84] And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
[1265.84 → 1267.84] No longer will there be any curse.
[1267.84 → 1273.84] The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city and his servants will serve him.
[1273.84 → 1278.84] They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads.
[1278.84 → 1279.84] There will be no more night.
[1279.84 → 1283.84] They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun.
[1283.84 → 1289.84] The Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever.
[1289.84 → 1290.84] Amen.
[1290.84 → 1296.84] With God at the centre of our lives, our redemption is assured.
[1296.84 → 1300.84] Let us therefore sing before the throne of God above.
[1300.84 → 1313.84] Let us stand.
[1313.84 → 1327.84] Before the throne of God above.
[1327.84 → 1332.84] I have a song and perfect lead.
[1332.84 → 1336.84] A great to his love.
[1336.84 → 1341.84] Whoever lives and please for me.
[1341.84 → 1345.84] My name is broken on his hands.
[1345.84 → 1350.84] My name is written on his call.
[1350.84 → 1354.84] I know that while in heavenly stands.
[1354.84 → 1359.84] No tongue can make me hence Devine.
[1359.84 → 1365.84] No tongue can make me hence Devine.
[1365.84 → 1370.84] When Satan tempts me to despair.
[1370.84 → 1375.84] And tells me of the guilt within.
[1375.84 → 1379.84] A word I look and see him there.
[1379.84 → 1384.84] Who made an end to all my sin.
[1384.84 → 1388.84] Because the sinless Saviour died.
[1388.84 → 1393.84] No sinful soul is counted free.
[1393.84 → 1397.84] For all the justice satisfied.
[1397.84 → 1401.84] To look on him and pardon me.
[1401.84 → 1406.84] To look on him and pardon me.
[1406.84 → 1413.84] Behold him there, the risen Lamb.
[1413.84 → 1418.84] My perfect spotless righteousness.
[1418.84 → 1422.84] The great unchangeable I am.
[1422.84 → 1427.84] The King of glory and of grace.
[1427.84 → 1431.84] One with himself I cannot die.
[1431.84 → 1436.84] My soul is purchased with his blood.
[1436.84 → 1440.84] My life is hidden with Christ on high.
[1440.84 → 1445.84] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1445.84 → 1452.84] With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1452.84 → 1457.84] I bow before the cross of Christ.
[1457.84 → 1462.84] And marvel at this love divine.
[1462.84 → 1467.84] God's perfect Son was sacrificed.
[1467.84 → 1472.84] To make me righteous in God's eyes.
[1472.84 → 1476.84] This river's Epsom cannot grow.
[1476.84 → 1480.84] But I can glory in his blood.
[1480.84 → 1485.84] The Lord most high has bowed down low.
[1485.84 → 1490.84] And poured on me his glorious love.
[1490.84 → 1495.84] And poured on me his glorious love.
[1506.84 → 1520.84] Holy words long preserved.
[1520.84 → 1525.84] For our walking discerned.
[1525.84 → 1529.84] They resound with God's own heart.
[1529.84 → 1535.84] Oh, let the ancient words impart.
[1535.84 → 1536.84] June shawl.
[1548.84 → 1550.84] June shawl.
[1550.84 → 1555.84] Wind shawl is Ca's B.
[1556.20 → 1560.84] Winter shawl and arsenous words.
[1560.84 → 1564.84] Change in me and changing you.
[1564.84 → 1568.68] We have come with open hearts,
[1568.92 → 1572.30] O let the ancient words impart.
[1575.64 → 1579.72] Holy words of our faith,
[1579.72 → 1583.72] handed down to the sage,
[1584.58 → 1587.72] came to us to sacrifice
[1588.26 → 1592.72] only in the faithful words of Christ.
[1594.84 → 1599.00] Ancient words of our truth,
[1599.00 → 1603.00] changing me and changing you.
[1603.00 → 1607.30] We have come with open hearts,
[1607.30 → 1611.42] O let the ancient words impart.
[1612.18 → 1616.00] Ancient words of our truth,
[1616.00 → 1619.84] changing me and changing you.
[1619.84 → 1624.00] We have come with open hearts,
[1624.00 → 1628.16] O let the ancient words impart.
[1628.16 → 1642.54] Martyrs' blood, stained each page,
[1642.54 → 1647.32] may have died for the sale.
[1647.32 → 1652.32] Hear them cry through the ears,
[1652.32 → 1657.48] Hear these words and hold them dear.
[1657.48 → 1662.48] Ancient words and the truth,
[1662.48 → 1666.48] changing me and changing you.
[1666.48 → 1670.64] We have come with open hearts,
[1670.64 → 1674.64] O let the ancient words impart.
[1674.64 → 1678.64] Ancient words and the truth,
[1678.64 → 1682.64] changing me and changing you.
[1682.64 → 1686.64] We have come with open hearts,
[1686.64 → 1694.80] O let the ancient words impart.
[1694.80 → 1699.92] We have come with open hearts,
[1699.92 → 1704.64] O let the ancient words impart.
[1704.64 → 1714.80] O let the ancient words impart.
[1714.80 → 1716.80] He means.
[1716.80 → 1728.96] O let the ancient words impart.
[1728.96 → 1730.96] Okay, the children are dismissed
[1730.96 → 1734.96] to go to their Sunday school classes.
[1734.96 → 1736.96] Thanks for joining us kids.
[1736.96 → 1760.12] Okay, so good morning to you all.
[1760.12 → 1761.72] Good morning.
[1761.72 → 1765.76] Today we are coming to the end of our sermon series
[1765.76 → 1767.16] in the book of Lamentations,
[1767.16 → 1769.52] as Ryan had mentioned earlier.
[1769.52 → 1771.92] Lamentations is an often ignored,
[1771.92 → 1777.00] yet important part of scripture.
[1777.00 → 1780.80] Maybe if you've been here for the last few weeks,
[1780.80 → 1783.16] or maybe just to catch up,
[1783.16 → 1787.26] Lamentations is composed of five poems.
[1787.26 → 1790.80] They're all written, we think, by the prophet Jeremiah.
[1790.80 → 1793.12] And he wrote them in response
[1793.12 → 1795.20] to witnessing his beloved city,
[1795.20 → 1799.04] the city of Jerusalem destroyed, sacked, and conquered
[1799.04 → 1803.04] by the Babylonians in 587 BC.
[1803.04 → 1805.44] And so what we find here in these five poems
[1805.44 → 1808.36] are words of lament.
[1808.36 → 1809.60] Words of lament.
[1809.60 → 1814.64] Words of prayer and protest to God
[1814.64 → 1819.44] that tell the painful truths of living
[1819.44 → 1821.28] and suffering in this world.
[1821.28 → 1824.20] And there are also petitions and protests
[1824.20 → 1827.28] asking God some very hard questions.
[1827.28 → 1831.60] And you know, for many of us, for many Christians,
[1831.60 → 1833.28] perhaps some of us here today,
[1833.28 → 1837.28] somewhere along the way, you may have gotten the idea
[1837.28 → 1843.60] that church and prayer and worship are only for the upbeat emotions of life.
[1843.60 → 1847.76] Things like joy and peace and harmony.
[1847.76 → 1850.00] And that church prayer, worship,
[1850.00 → 1855.36] they're not really for the downcast side of the emotional spectrum.
[1855.36 → 1859.64] Not for grief and confusion and heartache.
[1859.64 → 1864.40] How many of you listen to our local Christian radio?
[1864.40 → 1864.56] No.
[1866.24 → 1866.96] Okay.
[1866.96 → 1867.68] Two of you.
[1867.68 → 1868.00] Good.
[1868.00 → 1869.52] More than that.
[1869.52 → 1870.08] More than that.
[1871.84 → 1874.24] And so what is the tagline
[1874.24 → 1877.76] of our Vancouver Christian radio station
[1877.76 → 1880.40] and actually the tagline of like every single
[1880.40 → 1882.80] Christian radio station everywhere?
[1882.80 → 1883.60] What is it?
[1884.40 → 1884.96] Praise.
[1885.76 → 1886.04] Right?
[1886.46 → 1886.98] It says,
[1886.98 → 1889.50] Uplifting and encouraging.
[1890.18 → 1890.94] Praise FM.
[1891.86 → 1893.78] Why don't they have radio stations
[1893.78 → 1896.66] that are called anguished and angry?
[1897.54 → 1898.78] Lament FM.
[1899.84 → 1901.02] No one would listen to that.
[1901.94 → 1904.66] But sometimes that is what we need.
[1905.86 → 1908.16] But we're not used to thinking about prayer
[1908.16 → 1912.10] and our relationship with God in those terms.
[1913.02 → 1913.14] Right?
[1913.20 → 1914.46] With those kinds of emotions.
[1914.46 → 1914.70] Lamentations.
[1915.36 → 1916.70] And that's why we have been looking
[1916.70 → 1918.02] to this book of Lamentations.
[1918.20 → 1922.30] To teach us that lament is a part of the Christian life.
[1923.00 → 1923.12] Right?
[1923.20 → 1926.16] Lament is a part of the experience of God's people
[1926.16 → 1928.00] and it always has been.
[1929.08 → 1933.20] And we've seen that lament is a gift.
[1934.16 → 1934.30] Okay?
[1934.34 → 1937.82] But lament is a gift that God has given to us
[1937.82 → 1941.54] to help us navigate the tensions of life
[1941.54 → 1942.66] in a fallen world
[1942.66 → 1948.64] and to help us to reorient our hearts to God.
[1949.00 → 1950.66] To help us lift our hearts
[1950.66 → 1953.00] and turn our eyes to the Lord.
[1953.88 → 1955.78] And so hopefully these past few weeks
[1955.78 → 1958.08] you have been encouraged and maybe challenged
[1958.08 → 1962.28] to actually practice lament in our own lives.
[1962.68 → 1964.54] And as Ryan mentioned in the beginning,
[1964.76 → 1967.38] this evening we're going to have a chance
[1967.38 → 1970.24] and I want to issue a challenge to you
[1970.24 → 1971.48] to come tonight.
[1971.96 → 1973.88] We are having a service of lament
[1973.88 → 1975.22] so that we can practice
[1975.22 → 1977.24] what we have been talking about
[1977.24 → 1978.96] over these last few weeks.
[1979.30 → 1981.28] And I hope that this is a chance for us
[1981.28 → 1983.22] to kind of cement,
[1984.22 → 1985.64] practice, to experience
[1985.64 → 1987.36] what we've been talking about.
[1988.20 → 1989.26] And I'll say this,
[1989.34 → 1990.78] you know, maybe you right now
[1990.78 → 1993.58] are not in a season of life
[1993.58 → 1995.38] where you feel deeply
[1995.38 → 1996.82] the suffering of the world.
[1996.92 → 1998.48] Maybe you're more praised.
[1998.70 → 1999.60] Maybe you're more upbeat.
[2000.34 → 2002.24] But what I would want to encourage you to do
[2002.24 → 2004.58] is come and lament
[2004.58 → 2005.96] on behalf of someone else.
[2006.82 → 2008.84] If you're not feeling the need to lament,
[2008.98 → 2011.30] maybe come and, before God,
[2011.40 → 2012.82] lament on behalf of someone else.
[2013.32 → 2014.58] Maybe some of you will be bringing
[2014.58 → 2015.32] your own laments.
[2015.46 → 2016.62] But whatever the case,
[2016.94 → 2018.14] I encourage you to come tonight,
[2018.24 → 2018.86] seven o'clock,
[2018.98 → 2021.16] for a service where we just gather around
[2021.16 → 2024.88] and we bring before the Lord
[2024.88 → 2027.00] the suffering that we experience
[2027.00 → 2028.28] in our own lives and in the world.
[2029.84 → 2030.90] And we need to do that
[2030.90 → 2031.58] because, again,
[2031.64 → 2033.08] this is new for a lot of us.
[2033.86 → 2036.36] And we need help learning how to do this.
[2037.10 → 2039.00] And so when it comes to this passage today,
[2039.24 → 2040.66] as we've been talking about lament,
[2040.80 → 2042.66] the question might still remain,
[2043.42 → 2045.12] what does this actually look like
[2045.12 → 2046.78] to practice lament?
[2046.78 → 2051.44] And that's what we hope to explore today
[2051.44 → 2054.48] as we close out our sermon series on Lamentations.
[2054.70 → 2056.14] So would you please turn in your Bibles
[2056.14 → 2058.16] and look with me.
[2058.36 → 2059.54] Turn to Lamentations.
[2059.68 → 2060.48] I'm going to use this.
[2061.06 → 2061.94] I kind of forgot about this.
[2061.98 → 2063.18] I have this big reading Bible.
[2064.20 → 2065.28] So I'm going to pull this out.
[2066.60 → 2068.20] I'll have a different page number than you.
[2068.54 → 2070.00] But turn to Lamentations,
[2070.56 → 2071.64] chapter 5.
[2071.64 → 2076.32] And that's right after Jeremiah,
[2076.86 → 2078.02] right before Ezekiel.
[2079.32 → 2081.50] But we'll read Lamentations, chapter 5,
[2081.70 → 2082.84] the whole chapter.
[2084.60 → 2085.94] So let's give our attention
[2085.94 → 2087.00] to the reading of God's word.
[2087.16 → 2087.92] I'll read it for us.
[2088.92 → 2091.14] Remember, Lord, what has happened to us.
[2091.96 → 2094.34] Look and see our disgrace.
[2095.34 → 2097.90] Our inheritance has been turned
[2097.90 → 2099.72] over to strangers,
[2099.72 → 2101.90] our homes to foreigners.
[2103.22 → 2105.08] We have become fatherless.
[2105.66 → 2106.96] Our mothers are widows.
[2107.52 → 2109.48] We must buy the water we drink.
[2109.78 → 2112.12] Our wood can be had only at a price.
[2112.74 → 2114.60] Those who pursue us are at our heels.
[2114.70 → 2116.50] We are weary and find no rest.
[2117.32 → 2119.36] We submitted to Egypt and Assyria
[2119.36 → 2120.46] to get enough bread.
[2120.98 → 2123.40] Our ancestors sinned and are no more,
[2123.46 → 2124.52] and we bear their punishment.
[2125.24 → 2126.38] Slaves rule over us,
[2126.40 → 2127.74] and there is no one to free us
[2127.74 → 2128.54] from their hands.
[2128.54 → 2130.98] We get our bread at the risk of our lives
[2130.98 → 2132.82] because of the sword in the desert.
[2133.36 → 2134.82] Our skin is hot as an oven,
[2135.04 → 2135.94] feverish from hunger.
[2136.54 → 2138.28] Women have been violated in Zion,
[2138.76 → 2140.08] virgins in the town of Judah.
[2140.62 → 2142.50] Princes have been hung up by their hands.
[2142.88 → 2144.40] Elders are shown no respect.
[2145.04 → 2146.72] Young men toil at the millstones.
[2147.36 → 2149.38] Boys stagger under the loads of wood.
[2150.98 → 2153.16] The elders are gone from the city gate.
[2153.62 → 2155.38] The young men have stopped their music.
[2155.38 → 2157.94] Joy is gone from our hearts.
[2158.06 → 2160.56] Our dancing has turned to mourning.
[2161.66 → 2165.92] The crown has fallen from our head.
[2166.70 → 2168.58] Woe to us, for we have sinned.
[2169.22 → 2171.04] Because of this, our hearts are faint.
[2171.16 → 2174.08] Because of these things, our eyes grow dim.
[2174.82 → 2176.92] For Mount Zion, which lies desolate
[2176.92 → 2178.72] with jackals prowling over it.
[2178.72 → 2181.36] You, Lord, reign forever.
[2181.96 → 2184.46] Your throne endures from generation to generation.
[2185.46 → 2186.82] Why do you always forget us?
[2187.54 → 2190.52] Why do you forsake us so long?
[2190.86 → 2192.30] Restore us to yourself, Lord,
[2192.34 → 2193.34] that we may return.
[2194.02 → 2195.60] Renew our days as of old,
[2196.24 → 2198.58] unless you have utterly rejected us
[2198.58 → 2201.76] and are angry with us beyond measure.
[2201.76 → 2204.34] This is the word of the Lord.
[2206.34 → 2207.46] Please join me in prayer.
[2207.80 → 2208.22] Let's pray.
[2210.86 → 2213.56] Lord, we come before your word,
[2213.66 → 2216.90] ancient words that are true,
[2217.90 → 2219.34] that change us.
[2220.72 → 2223.14] So, Lord, we pray that you would, Lord,
[2223.24 → 2225.02] speak through your word to us this morning.
[2225.22 → 2226.60] Lord, meet us where we are
[2226.60 → 2229.34] and transform us more into the image of your son.
[2229.34 → 2230.44] Lord, we need your help.
[2230.98 → 2232.48] We need your spirit to be at work.
[2233.08 → 2234.46] We pray in Jesus' name.
[2234.82 → 2235.04] Amen.
[2238.08 → 2239.56] So, as I said,
[2239.68 → 2241.28] here in Lamentations chapter 5,
[2241.36 → 2243.34] we're going to get a very helpful example.
[2244.54 → 2245.66] Sorry, I just want to move this.
[2246.24 → 2247.34] Of what lamentation,
[2248.22 → 2250.00] what lament actually looks like.
[2251.30 → 2255.16] Now, lament is not a cookie cutter process, right?
[2255.20 → 2257.18] There isn't a set process here.
[2257.76 → 2259.20] It's not neat and tidy.
[2259.92 → 2261.02] But with all that said,
[2261.08 → 2262.96] in this closing chapter of Lamentations,
[2263.32 → 2265.14] we do see, I think,
[2265.20 → 2266.72] four broad steps
[2266.72 → 2268.32] that help us,
[2268.56 → 2269.80] that give us kind of framework
[2269.80 → 2271.72] for us to better engage
[2271.72 → 2272.60] and to practice lament.
[2272.90 → 2274.00] We have four steps
[2274.00 → 2275.62] that we can think about
[2275.62 → 2277.58] as we try to really live into this
[2277.58 → 2279.08] and practice lament.
[2279.92 → 2281.24] And so that's what we're going to look at today
[2281.24 → 2281.76] in our sermon.
[2282.02 → 2284.04] We're going to look at these four steps
[2284.04 → 2285.06] of lament together.
[2285.28 → 2286.70] So let's dive right in.
[2286.70 → 2287.98] We have four steps.
[2287.98 → 2292.52] And the first one is to turn.
[2293.46 → 2297.48] Turn and directly address God in prayer.
[2298.72 → 2303.84] Now, I know this seems like an obvious first step, right?
[2303.84 → 2306.06] But it's not always easy.
[2306.42 → 2307.80] It's not always easy
[2307.80 → 2309.52] when we are suffering
[2309.52 → 2311.56] to turn to God,
[2312.28 → 2313.46] to take that first step.
[2314.14 → 2315.44] And we also see that
[2315.44 → 2317.14] it wasn't easy for Jeremiah
[2317.14 → 2319.00] or the people of Israel either.
[2319.00 → 2320.46] And I want to show you one way
[2320.46 → 2321.26] that we see that.
[2321.50 → 2322.26] Because remember,
[2322.64 → 2324.24] if you've heard in the last few weeks,
[2324.80 → 2326.38] the first four chapters
[2326.38 → 2327.76] of the book of Lamentations
[2327.76 → 2328.90] are four poems
[2328.90 → 2330.48] that are acrostics.
[2330.98 → 2331.78] We talked about that.
[2331.88 → 2334.08] So verse one begins with A,
[2334.32 → 2336.22] verse two begins with B,
[2336.46 → 2336.96] verse three,
[2337.40 → 2337.68] C,
[2337.82 → 2338.46] and so on.
[2338.82 → 2340.00] It's an acrostic poem,
[2340.10 → 2340.72] of course, in Hebrew.
[2341.68 → 2342.42] And so in that way,
[2342.50 → 2343.34] it's very organized,
[2343.62 → 2344.34] it's very neat
[2344.34 → 2345.18] and tidy
[2345.18 → 2346.40] and orderly.
[2347.40 → 2348.36] And it's almost as if
[2348.36 → 2349.54] the author has been attempting
[2349.54 → 2351.40] to bring some sort of order
[2351.40 → 2353.64] to the chaos
[2353.64 → 2355.32] that he is describing
[2355.32 → 2357.10] and that he is experiencing.
[2357.84 → 2359.74] But here in chapter five,
[2359.88 → 2361.20] it all breaks down.
[2361.94 → 2363.72] Chapter five is not an acrostic.
[2364.36 → 2365.86] There are still 22 verses,
[2366.18 → 2367.48] but they're all out of order.
[2368.12 → 2369.38] It's almost as if
[2369.38 → 2371.54] the author is losing his grip.
[2372.18 → 2373.20] It's almost as if
[2373.20 → 2374.68] just after describing
[2374.68 → 2375.56] all this suffering,
[2375.56 → 2377.12] it's just kind of the order,
[2377.26 → 2378.08] the neatness of it
[2378.08 → 2379.80] just kind of dissolves.
[2380.88 → 2382.24] Order goes out the window
[2382.24 → 2384.22] and now he's just crying out to God
[2384.22 → 2385.66] with whatever words
[2385.66 → 2386.98] he can manage.
[2388.32 → 2389.60] So now the question would be then,
[2389.70 → 2390.00] why?
[2390.16 → 2391.50] What has caused
[2391.50 → 2393.80] the author such distress?
[2394.60 → 2394.82] Right?
[2394.88 → 2395.90] What could be worse
[2395.90 → 2397.36] than the suffering
[2397.36 → 2397.96] and the danger
[2397.96 → 2398.72] and the trauma
[2398.72 → 2400.70] that he's already written about?
[2402.02 → 2403.38] Well, I think it's that
[2403.38 → 2404.88] Jeremiah has realized
[2404.88 → 2406.98] that God has
[2406.98 → 2409.32] actually withdrawn
[2409.32 → 2410.90] his presence
[2410.90 → 2411.66] from his people.
[2412.88 → 2414.98] That God is not with them anymore.
[2415.68 → 2417.48] And this is worse
[2417.48 → 2419.58] than any other kind of suffering.
[2420.68 → 2420.84] Right?
[2420.90 → 2422.56] Because to suffer
[2422.56 → 2424.80] with God's presence
[2424.80 → 2426.76] is to know his comfort,
[2426.88 → 2428.26] to know his love.
[2428.26 → 2429.72] And that's what makes
[2429.72 → 2430.54] suffering bearable.
[2431.10 → 2431.96] But to suffer
[2431.96 → 2433.56] without God's presence,
[2433.76 → 2435.32] that is actually far worse.
[2436.02 → 2436.72] That is
[2436.72 → 2438.64] actually hellish.
[2440.50 → 2441.72] And so Jeremiah shows us
[2441.72 → 2442.42] what it looks like
[2442.42 → 2443.10] to pray
[2443.10 → 2444.84] a prayer of lament
[2444.84 → 2446.14] when you feel
[2446.14 → 2446.90] abandoned
[2446.90 → 2447.70] and rejected
[2447.70 → 2448.30] by God.
[2448.34 → 2449.38] When you feel
[2449.38 → 2450.84] God's absence.
[2452.40 → 2453.46] And so here's what we see.
[2453.54 → 2454.32] Look at verse 1.
[2454.32 → 2456.68] It says,
[2457.18 → 2457.92] Remember, Lord,
[2458.00 → 2459.54] what has happened to us.
[2459.70 → 2460.00] Look
[2460.00 → 2461.22] and see
[2461.22 → 2462.72] our disgrace.
[2464.76 → 2465.30] Now,
[2466.12 → 2466.82] we should know
[2466.82 → 2467.52] that whenever
[2467.52 → 2468.82] a biblical author
[2468.82 → 2469.96] asks God
[2469.96 → 2470.80] to remember
[2470.80 → 2472.00] or writes
[2472.00 → 2472.48] that God
[2472.48 → 2473.66] remembered something,
[2474.22 → 2475.64] it's not a theological
[2475.64 → 2476.30] statement
[2476.30 → 2477.34] like
[2477.34 → 2478.88] God is kind of senile
[2478.88 → 2479.46] or that God
[2479.46 → 2480.46] is kind of forgetful.
[2481.00 → 2481.26] Right?
[2481.30 → 2482.50] Or that he has actually
[2482.50 → 2483.74] forgotten about you.
[2483.74 → 2484.72] That's not what
[2484.72 → 2485.32] he is saying.
[2485.96 → 2486.40] Rather,
[2486.56 → 2488.18] it's an experiential statement.
[2488.84 → 2489.62] He's talking about
[2489.62 → 2491.94] how hard it is
[2491.94 → 2493.16] to feel
[2493.16 → 2494.96] forgotten by God.
[2495.46 → 2496.56] When we feel
[2496.56 → 2497.56] that God has forgotten us
[2497.56 → 2498.46] and we cry out to God
[2498.46 → 2498.78] and we say,
[2499.06 → 2500.16] Lord, remember me.
[2500.32 → 2500.54] Look,
[2500.90 → 2501.10] you know,
[2501.20 → 2501.68] and we're not saying
[2501.68 → 2502.00] that God,
[2502.08 → 2502.78] you just forget stuff.
[2502.86 → 2503.18] We're saying,
[2503.46 → 2504.02] remember me.
[2505.12 → 2506.18] And that's why
[2506.18 → 2507.24] this prayer of lament
[2507.24 → 2508.96] begins by turning to God.
[2510.02 → 2510.42] And here,
[2510.50 → 2511.58] Jeremiah asked God
[2511.58 → 2512.70] to remember,
[2512.70 → 2513.56] to look,
[2513.74 → 2514.50] to see.
[2515.34 → 2516.20] And he wants to be
[2516.20 → 2518.04] restored to God's presence.
[2520.28 → 2521.10] So you see,
[2521.18 → 2522.28] sometimes when we think
[2522.28 → 2522.80] about lament,
[2523.84 → 2525.22] we think of lament
[2525.22 → 2526.70] as maybe being synonymous,
[2526.88 → 2527.56] as being the same
[2527.56 → 2528.50] as just crying.
[2529.16 → 2529.42] Right?
[2529.48 → 2530.40] So we think of lament
[2530.40 → 2532.18] as just crying out loud,
[2532.86 → 2533.64] crying out to God.
[2533.96 → 2534.64] But actually,
[2534.76 → 2535.90] lament and crying,
[2536.36 → 2536.98] there's a difference.
[2537.04 → 2537.94] There's an important difference.
[2538.02 → 2539.18] They're not exactly the same.
[2539.88 → 2540.04] See,
[2540.16 → 2542.52] crying is a very natural
[2542.52 → 2543.82] human response.
[2544.82 → 2545.00] Right?
[2545.04 → 2546.04] You don't have to teach a baby
[2546.04 → 2546.60] how to cry.
[2547.14 → 2548.02] They start crying
[2548.02 → 2549.08] the moment they come out
[2549.08 → 2549.52] of the womb.
[2550.50 → 2551.62] And as parents can attest,
[2551.70 → 2552.62] sometimes it's really hard
[2552.62 → 2553.90] to get them to stop crying.
[2554.76 → 2555.82] Crying is just
[2555.82 → 2557.04] human.
[2557.22 → 2557.98] It's just natural.
[2558.56 → 2559.72] But to lament
[2559.72 → 2560.92] is Christian.
[2561.92 → 2562.66] The difference
[2562.66 → 2563.60] between crying
[2563.60 → 2564.12] and lament
[2564.12 → 2565.44] is not the emotions,
[2565.44 → 2566.26] it's not the tears
[2566.26 → 2567.48] running down our cheeks,
[2567.48 → 2568.40] but the difference
[2568.40 → 2569.70] is who we turn to.
[2570.98 → 2571.40] See,
[2571.48 → 2572.32] when we cry,
[2573.58 → 2574.00] we might,
[2574.32 → 2574.40] how,
[2574.64 → 2575.82] what might we turn to
[2575.82 → 2576.44] when we cry?
[2576.60 → 2576.80] Well,
[2576.90 → 2577.34] a baby
[2577.34 → 2577.96] who's crying
[2577.96 → 2579.34] might turn to his mother.
[2579.92 → 2581.08] Or when we cry,
[2581.18 → 2582.90] we might turn to ourselves,
[2583.38 → 2584.60] have a talk with ourselves.
[2585.06 → 2586.50] We might turn to our spouse.
[2587.16 → 2588.38] We might turn to family
[2588.38 → 2588.96] or friends.
[2589.40 → 2590.94] We might turn to our friends,
[2591.04 → 2591.54] Ben and Jerry,
[2592.18 → 2593.60] who make a great
[2593.60 → 2594.32] pint of ice cream.
[2595.38 → 2596.94] We might turn to our pillow.
[2597.48 → 2599.40] We might turn to Taylor Swift
[2599.40 → 2600.72] and her music.
[2601.34 → 2601.46] Right?
[2602.14 → 2603.04] We turn to all these
[2603.04 → 2603.72] different things,
[2603.84 → 2605.60] but when we lament,
[2606.38 → 2607.58] we turn to God.
[2608.22 → 2609.20] We turn to the Lord,
[2609.26 → 2610.40] and that is a pivotal
[2610.40 → 2612.04] first step.
[2613.00 → 2614.24] So instead of focusing
[2614.24 → 2616.40] on the rubble of life,
[2616.54 → 2617.92] we turn, and we focus
[2617.92 → 2619.24] on the Redeemer of life.
[2619.74 → 2619.90] Okay?
[2619.90 → 2620.68] We don't look at all
[2620.68 → 2621.54] the surrounding things
[2621.54 → 2622.34] that are falling apart,
[2622.54 → 2624.14] but we turn to God
[2624.14 → 2625.24] and we look to Him
[2625.24 → 2626.22] because He is the Redeemer.
[2626.22 → 2627.90] And so in lament,
[2628.02 → 2628.36] we're saying,
[2628.68 → 2628.72] Lord,
[2628.92 → 2630.14] my life is a mess.
[2630.48 → 2630.66] Lord,
[2630.80 → 2631.64] the world is broken.
[2632.02 → 2633.14] I am not in control.
[2633.52 → 2634.78] Everything that I hoped
[2634.78 → 2636.42] and dreamed for
[2636.42 → 2637.54] has fallen apart.
[2638.12 → 2639.24] I don't know what to do.
[2639.42 → 2640.80] I feel like you've abandoned me,
[2641.46 → 2643.82] but I am turning to you now.
[2644.36 → 2646.14] I am fixing my eyes
[2646.14 → 2647.58] on you now.
[2648.26 → 2648.56] And friends,
[2648.62 → 2649.84] that is where lament begins.
[2650.56 → 2651.64] It's a really crucial
[2651.64 → 2652.20] first step.
[2652.34 → 2653.16] Turn to God
[2653.16 → 2654.84] and reorient your heart
[2654.84 → 2655.20] to Him.
[2655.52 → 2656.40] That's what we do in lament.
[2657.40 → 2658.08] Step one.
[2658.30 → 2659.00] Okay, that's step one.
[2659.46 → 2660.98] Now, after we turn to God,
[2661.08 → 2662.30] the second step of lament
[2662.30 → 2663.82] is to complain.
[2664.88 → 2665.32] Really?
[2666.10 → 2666.54] Yes.
[2667.70 → 2669.06] Complain to God.
[2669.74 → 2670.82] Honestly, tell Him
[2670.82 → 2672.80] about your specific pains,
[2672.90 → 2674.14] your specific sufferings.
[2674.88 → 2676.18] Tell God the things
[2676.18 → 2676.90] that have caused you
[2676.90 → 2677.74] so much sorrow.
[2677.74 → 2680.44] Now, honestly,
[2680.60 → 2681.48] sometimes I think
[2681.48 → 2682.16] we hesitate
[2682.16 → 2685.12] to complain to God
[2685.12 → 2687.42] because we feel uncomfortable.
[2687.58 → 2688.26] We feel like maybe
[2688.26 → 2690.16] complaining doesn't really fit
[2690.16 → 2691.84] our understanding
[2691.84 → 2692.74] of what it means
[2692.74 → 2693.80] to be a faithful Christian.
[2694.70 → 2696.00] We shouldn't complain to God.
[2696.84 → 2697.20] And yet,
[2697.30 → 2698.40] God invites us
[2698.40 → 2700.48] to bring all of our complaints
[2700.48 → 2701.02] to Him.
[2701.94 → 2702.46] In fact,
[2702.50 → 2703.48] when you look at this passage,
[2703.92 → 2704.98] the longest section
[2704.98 → 2705.98] of the entire chapter,
[2706.10 → 2706.52] the prayer,
[2706.52 → 2707.84] is actually Jeremiah
[2707.84 → 2708.88] just complaining.
[2709.48 → 2711.28] He's honestly presenting
[2711.28 → 2713.32] these very specific
[2713.32 → 2715.18] pains and sorrows to God
[2715.18 → 2716.32] all the way from verse 2
[2716.32 → 2717.88] through to verse 18.
[2718.72 → 2719.54] Now, we won't read
[2719.54 → 2720.26] the whole thing again,
[2720.36 → 2721.36] but let me just point out
[2721.36 → 2723.08] a few of the things
[2723.08 → 2725.00] that Jeremiah complains about.
[2725.50 → 2726.34] So let's just look.
[2726.42 → 2727.22] Verse 2 and 3.
[2727.74 → 2728.26] He says,
[2728.78 → 2729.60] Our inheritance,
[2730.44 → 2731.42] the promised land,
[2731.50 → 2732.18] the land that God
[2732.18 → 2732.70] had given us,
[2732.88 → 2733.70] has been turned over
[2733.70 → 2734.96] to strangers,
[2735.50 → 2736.20] our homes,
[2736.20 → 2737.02] to foreigners,
[2737.02 → 2737.04] to foreigners,
[2737.28 → 2738.72] we have become fatherless,
[2738.82 → 2739.36] our mothers,
[2739.56 → 2740.38] our widows.
[2742.18 → 2742.42] Right?
[2742.52 → 2743.58] Jeremiah is complaining
[2743.58 → 2745.86] how life has been turned
[2745.86 → 2747.80] completely upside down.
[2748.42 → 2750.08] People have taken our land.
[2750.82 → 2752.50] They've invaded our homes.
[2752.64 → 2754.10] They've broken our families.
[2754.54 → 2755.94] We have lost everything.
[2757.84 → 2759.34] In verses 10 to 13,
[2759.52 → 2760.78] he complains then
[2760.78 → 2761.94] about this shameful
[2761.94 → 2763.16] humiliation
[2763.16 → 2764.92] temptation that the people
[2764.92 → 2766.38] of Israel have had to endure.
[2767.38 → 2768.80] He describes how women
[2768.80 → 2769.76] have been abused,
[2770.14 → 2771.18] how leaders have been
[2771.18 → 2772.02] publicly hung,
[2772.60 → 2773.98] how the elders have been
[2773.98 → 2774.98] mocked,
[2774.98 → 2776.62] and the youth of the city
[2776.62 → 2778.04] are forced into
[2778.04 → 2779.32] back-breaking labour
[2779.32 → 2780.86] doing the work
[2780.86 → 2781.66] of farm animals.
[2781.66 → 2784.02] And you know,
[2784.08 → 2785.94] sometimes in military
[2785.94 → 2786.98] defeat,
[2787.16 → 2787.86] there can be some
[2787.86 → 2788.98] sort of dignity.
[2789.42 → 2789.62] You know,
[2789.70 → 2790.30] you're conquered,
[2790.48 → 2791.08] you surrender,
[2791.80 → 2792.94] and the opposing side
[2792.94 → 2793.72] shows courtesy
[2793.72 → 2794.90] and respect
[2794.90 → 2796.38] for the enemy
[2796.38 → 2797.02] in battle.
[2797.56 → 2798.62] Not so here.
[2799.16 → 2799.76] That is not how
[2799.76 → 2800.80] the Babylonians operated.
[2801.84 → 2802.74] And so the people
[2802.74 → 2804.00] are suffering
[2804.00 → 2804.82] in their defeat
[2804.82 → 2805.82] shame
[2805.82 → 2806.62] and cruelty
[2806.62 → 2808.36] and degrading
[2808.36 → 2808.86] treatment
[2808.86 → 2810.20] by their enemies.
[2810.82 → 2811.86] And because of that,
[2811.92 → 2812.46] what follows
[2812.46 → 2813.94] is sorrow.
[2815.08 → 2815.58] And Jeremiah
[2815.58 → 2816.66] complains about
[2816.66 → 2817.38] the emotional
[2817.38 → 2818.40] and the mental toil
[2818.40 → 2819.06] that all of this
[2819.06 → 2819.80] has had on them.
[2820.38 → 2821.20] So verse 15,
[2822.40 → 2822.74] he says,
[2823.14 → 2824.14] joy is gone
[2824.14 → 2825.20] from our hearts.
[2825.38 → 2826.00] Our dancing
[2826.00 → 2827.16] has turned to mourning.
[2828.34 → 2829.08] Verse 17,
[2829.64 → 2830.70] because of this,
[2831.04 → 2832.16] our hearts are faint.
[2832.38 → 2833.26] Because of these things,
[2833.36 → 2833.98] our eyes
[2833.98 → 2834.94] grow dim.
[2835.94 → 2836.46] He's saying,
[2836.62 → 2836.78] Lord,
[2836.88 → 2838.06] our hearts are broken.
[2840.06 → 2840.30] Right?
[2840.42 → 2842.90] They are in emotional
[2842.90 → 2845.14] and mental distress.
[2845.62 → 2846.16] Not just what
[2846.16 → 2847.08] they're suffering physically.
[2849.96 → 2851.28] And it's from
[2851.28 → 2852.46] this place of trauma
[2852.46 → 2854.32] that the author
[2854.32 → 2855.90] releases this cry
[2855.90 → 2856.42] of lament
[2856.42 → 2858.00] by praying honestly
[2858.00 → 2858.64] from his heart,
[2858.74 → 2859.66] from his gut,
[2860.36 → 2861.50] complaining to God
[2861.50 → 2862.64] of these very
[2862.64 → 2864.28] specific things
[2864.28 → 2865.28] that he is suffering
[2865.28 → 2865.98] and his people
[2865.98 → 2866.48] are suffering.
[2867.60 → 2868.06] And so what these
[2868.06 → 2869.02] verses show us
[2869.02 → 2870.68] is that we must
[2870.68 → 2871.44] talk to God
[2871.44 → 2872.06] honestly
[2872.06 → 2873.86] about what
[2873.86 → 2875.36] it feels like
[2875.36 → 2877.40] in life.
[2879.00 → 2879.46] And now,
[2879.54 → 2880.14] so we hear this,
[2880.22 → 2880.88] that we have to talk
[2880.88 → 2881.64] to God honestly.
[2882.00 → 2882.86] And you might be thinking,
[2882.96 → 2883.50] well, wait a minute.
[2884.30 → 2885.52] Doesn't God already know?
[2886.06 → 2886.18] Right?
[2886.26 → 2887.32] Doesn't God already know
[2887.32 → 2888.34] everything that's happening?
[2888.50 → 2889.50] Doesn't God already know
[2889.50 → 2890.06] my pain?
[2890.06 → 2892.68] You are very right.
[2894.00 → 2894.22] Right?
[2894.30 → 2895.52] God is omniscient.
[2895.92 → 2897.02] He already knows
[2897.02 → 2898.16] everything about us.
[2899.06 → 2900.72] But we go through
[2900.72 → 2902.20] this step of complaining
[2902.20 → 2903.12] not because God
[2903.12 → 2904.16] needs to know
[2904.16 → 2905.02] our pain,
[2905.22 → 2906.64] but because our pains
[2906.64 → 2907.72] need to know
[2907.72 → 2908.24] our God.
[2909.70 → 2909.96] Right?
[2910.54 → 2912.20] Our loneliness
[2912.20 → 2914.46] and our longings,
[2915.06 → 2916.42] our dashed hopes
[2916.42 → 2917.04] and dreams,
[2917.42 → 2918.06] the conflict
[2918.06 → 2918.78] in our marriage,
[2919.06 → 2920.30] our financial insecurity,
[2920.84 → 2921.42] our inability
[2921.42 → 2922.34] to start a family,
[2922.96 → 2923.98] our wayward children
[2923.98 → 2925.08] who seem to be
[2925.08 → 2925.98] destroying their lives,
[2926.06 → 2927.24] the death of a loved one.
[2927.56 → 2928.84] All of these things
[2928.84 → 2929.54] need to know
[2929.54 → 2930.64] who our God is.
[2932.34 → 2933.70] God knows it all,
[2934.14 → 2935.16] but our pain
[2935.16 → 2936.48] needs to know God.
[2936.76 → 2939.12] And as we honestly pray
[2939.12 → 2940.38] for these specific things,
[2940.48 → 2941.44] we're reminding ourselves
[2941.44 → 2942.84] that God can handle
[2942.84 → 2943.86] anything
[2943.86 → 2945.20] that we are going through.
[2945.84 → 2946.60] So we bring them
[2946.60 → 2947.28] before the Lord.
[2948.06 → 2949.40] And so complaining,
[2949.52 → 2950.24] it's not meant to be
[2950.24 → 2951.26] just an end in itself.
[2951.36 → 2951.84] It's not like,
[2952.30 → 2952.62] you know,
[2952.70 → 2953.92] we kind of self-righteously
[2953.92 → 2954.72] come before God,
[2954.80 → 2955.60] we complain,
[2955.94 → 2956.62] drop the mic,
[2956.74 → 2957.72] and walk out of the room.
[2959.28 → 2960.60] God doesn't just invite us
[2960.60 → 2961.60] to a ranting session,
[2962.16 → 2963.60] but he invites us
[2963.60 → 2965.00] to bring all of our sorrows
[2965.00 → 2965.80] of life to him,
[2965.84 → 2967.24] no matter how big or small,
[2967.66 → 2968.92] because he is
[2968.92 → 2970.14] the God who sees
[2970.14 → 2971.26] and who knows,
[2972.06 → 2973.20] and because he is the God
[2973.20 → 2974.60] who can renew
[2974.60 → 2976.18] and who can restore.
[2976.18 → 2978.44] Okay, so we complain,
[2978.52 → 2979.42] that's the second thing.
[2980.42 → 2981.30] And that leads us
[2981.30 → 2982.14] to the third step.
[2983.18 → 2986.02] See, after we turn
[2986.02 → 2986.60] and we,
[2986.84 → 2987.70] after we complain,
[2987.84 → 2989.22] the third step of lament
[2989.22 → 2990.60] is to trust,
[2991.36 → 2993.04] to affirm God's goodness
[2993.04 → 2994.40] in faith.
[2995.70 → 2997.12] So in our passage,
[2998.54 → 2999.12] Jeremiah,
[2999.64 → 3000.62] next,
[3000.70 → 3001.98] he gives voice
[3001.98 → 3004.00] to one of the most pressing
[3004.00 → 3005.08] and important questions
[3005.08 → 3006.00] that we ask
[3006.00 → 3007.04] in times or seasons
[3007.04 → 3007.70] of suffering.
[3008.56 → 3009.64] Right, when we feel
[3009.64 → 3010.80] like God has withdrawn
[3010.80 → 3012.36] his presence from us,
[3012.62 → 3013.72] we ask this,
[3013.80 → 3014.24] we ask,
[3014.80 → 3016.64] if God is all-powerful,
[3017.64 → 3019.22] why hasn't he intervened
[3019.22 → 3019.78] in my life?
[3020.94 → 3021.96] Let me say that again.
[3022.42 → 3024.04] If God is all-powerful,
[3024.66 → 3027.82] why hasn't he intervened
[3027.82 → 3029.08] in my life?
[3029.84 → 3030.88] Isn't that the question
[3030.88 → 3031.44] we ask?
[3033.02 → 3034.28] So look with me
[3034.28 → 3036.32] at verse 19.
[3036.78 → 3037.34] Because Jeremiah
[3037.34 → 3038.30] asked the same question.
[3038.46 → 3039.16] First he says,
[3039.66 → 3040.32] you, Lord,
[3040.60 → 3041.62] reign forever.
[3042.06 → 3043.28] Your throne endures
[3043.28 → 3044.16] from generation
[3044.16 → 3044.84] to generation.
[3045.42 → 3046.50] So he's saying,
[3046.66 → 3047.36] despite everything
[3047.36 → 3047.98] that has happened,
[3048.90 → 3050.00] all of this suffering,
[3050.58 → 3052.04] Babylon completely
[3052.04 → 3052.94] destroying us,
[3053.42 → 3054.56] God, you are still sovereign.
[3055.40 → 3056.32] God, you are still
[3056.32 → 3056.96] in control.
[3056.96 → 3060.18] You're on your throne.
[3060.58 → 3061.66] You are king.
[3063.18 → 3064.24] But then,
[3064.50 → 3065.32] in verse 20,
[3065.68 → 3067.34] he asks this important question.
[3068.30 → 3069.96] Why do you always forget us?
[3070.88 → 3073.36] Why do you forsake us
[3073.36 → 3074.08] so long?
[3074.94 → 3075.64] Right, what question
[3075.64 → 3076.18] is he asking?
[3076.30 → 3076.90] He's asking,
[3077.30 → 3077.84] okay, God,
[3078.08 → 3079.64] you're still all-powerful.
[3079.96 → 3081.30] Why haven't you intervened
[3081.30 → 3081.84] in my life?
[3082.80 → 3084.00] You're on your throne,
[3084.00 → 3086.14] so what gives?
[3087.08 → 3087.32] Right?
[3089.62 → 3090.82] Now, you may be thinking,
[3091.04 → 3091.86] well, that doesn't sound
[3091.86 → 3092.62] like faith.
[3093.40 → 3094.40] That doesn't really sound
[3094.40 → 3095.04] like trust,
[3095.68 → 3096.80] trusting God.
[3097.56 → 3098.46] But you know what?
[3098.54 → 3099.20] Think of this.
[3100.06 → 3101.66] I am actually really glad
[3101.66 → 3103.20] that verse 20
[3103.20 → 3104.98] is in our passage.
[3106.10 → 3107.86] Because I think,
[3108.14 → 3108.50] probably,
[3108.60 → 3108.98] I'm guessing,
[3109.10 → 3109.98] like many of you,
[3110.38 → 3111.54] this is often
[3111.54 → 3112.50] how I pray.
[3113.70 → 3114.12] God,
[3114.24 → 3115.40] I trust you,
[3116.26 → 3117.62] but why is this happening?
[3118.64 → 3119.04] God,
[3119.12 → 3120.66] my hope is in you,
[3121.28 → 3122.60] but why has nothing
[3122.60 → 3123.58] changed in my life?
[3124.42 → 3125.66] You are Lord,
[3126.22 → 3127.04] but I still have
[3127.04 → 3127.76] all these questions.
[3128.80 → 3128.96] Right?
[3129.02 → 3129.94] This is how we pray.
[3131.32 → 3131.50] So,
[3131.62 → 3132.66] and so what we learn
[3132.66 → 3133.64] is that faith
[3133.64 → 3135.00] doesn't remove
[3135.00 → 3135.62] the questions.
[3136.82 → 3137.86] Faith simply gives us
[3137.86 → 3138.36] courage
[3138.36 → 3139.44] to ask the questions.
[3139.44 → 3141.40] So,
[3141.56 → 3142.02] Jeremiah,
[3142.14 → 3142.94] he brings up
[3142.94 → 3143.70] these questions
[3143.70 → 3144.32] in verse 20,
[3144.40 → 3145.98] not because he lacks faith.
[3146.54 → 3146.80] Right?
[3146.86 → 3147.80] He just had this
[3147.80 → 3149.12] beautiful declaration
[3149.12 → 3150.66] of faith.
[3150.80 → 3151.14] Lord,
[3151.34 → 3152.72] you reign forever.
[3153.74 → 3154.34] It's a beautiful
[3154.34 → 3155.26] declaration of faith.
[3155.34 → 3156.52] He's not doubting God,
[3157.04 → 3158.88] but it then leads him
[3158.88 → 3159.92] to bring this question
[3159.92 → 3160.64] before God
[3160.64 → 3162.38] precisely because
[3162.38 → 3163.50] he has faith.
[3163.56 → 3164.28] He trusts God.
[3164.82 → 3166.26] He knows God's character.
[3167.52 → 3167.66] Right?
[3167.66 → 3168.92] He knows who God is,
[3169.06 → 3170.68] and so he brings
[3170.68 → 3171.72] his question to God
[3171.72 → 3173.14] because he wants to hear
[3173.14 → 3174.22] what God has to say.
[3174.94 → 3176.20] He's seeking God
[3176.20 → 3177.86] because he has faith in him.
[3178.90 → 3179.10] Right?
[3179.14 → 3179.42] He's saying,
[3179.48 → 3179.64] God,
[3179.70 → 3181.14] I know the kind of God
[3181.14 → 3181.58] you are.
[3181.78 → 3182.60] I know you are
[3182.60 → 3183.34] a God of love.
[3184.50 → 3185.78] I know you're good.
[3185.94 → 3186.94] I know you're sovereign.
[3187.78 → 3188.22] So,
[3188.28 → 3188.96] here's my question.
[3189.08 → 3189.98] What is going on?
[3191.30 → 3191.60] And so,
[3191.66 → 3192.52] we can trust God
[3192.52 → 3193.04] in our lament.
[3193.44 → 3194.94] We can profess
[3194.94 → 3195.66] our faith
[3195.66 → 3196.26] and our trust
[3196.26 → 3196.68] that God,
[3196.78 → 3197.54] you reign forever
[3197.54 → 3199.42] because we know
[3199.42 → 3200.18] who he is
[3200.18 → 3202.24] and then we can bring
[3202.24 → 3203.20] our questions
[3203.20 → 3204.70] in lament.
[3205.10 → 3205.94] That's what lament is.
[3206.00 → 3206.52] In protest,
[3206.72 → 3207.40] here's my complaint.
[3207.70 → 3208.02] God,
[3208.82 → 3210.04] what's going on?
[3210.94 → 3211.84] But we do that
[3211.84 → 3212.72] because we have hope.
[3213.04 → 3213.88] We have hope
[3213.88 → 3215.58] for what God will do
[3215.58 → 3216.84] because we know
[3216.84 → 3217.48] who he is.
[3218.76 → 3218.94] Okay,
[3218.98 → 3219.72] so that's the third one.
[3219.72 → 3219.96] Now,
[3220.12 → 3220.82] this brings us
[3220.82 → 3221.36] to the fourth
[3221.36 → 3222.18] and final step.
[3222.92 → 3224.30] After we turn to God
[3224.30 → 3225.38] and we complain
[3225.38 → 3226.06] before him
[3226.06 → 3227.54] and we trust him,
[3228.34 → 3229.08] the final step
[3229.08 → 3229.48] of lament
[3229.48 → 3231.42] is to ask.
[3232.08 → 3233.16] We boldly
[3233.16 → 3234.60] call upon God
[3234.60 → 3235.98] to restore.
[3237.68 → 3239.02] And we see this
[3239.02 → 3240.00] in the closing verses
[3240.00 → 3240.86] of Lamentations,
[3240.92 → 3241.48] chapter five.
[3241.64 → 3241.84] So,
[3241.92 → 3243.32] let's look at verse 21.
[3244.24 → 3245.06] It says this,
[3245.06 → 3246.96] Restore us
[3246.96 → 3247.66] to yourself,
[3247.84 → 3248.06] Lord,
[3248.66 → 3250.00] that we may return,
[3250.14 → 3251.16] renew our days
[3251.16 → 3252.18] as of old.
[3253.68 → 3254.22] So,
[3254.34 → 3255.70] what is this prayer for?
[3256.06 → 3257.22] What's the prayer
[3257.22 → 3257.84] of lament?
[3259.10 → 3260.48] What does the author
[3260.48 → 3262.06] really want?
[3263.18 → 3264.20] Notice he's not
[3264.20 → 3264.98] asking,
[3265.52 → 3266.22] first and foremost,
[3266.44 → 3266.84] for God
[3266.84 → 3268.06] to fix all of his problems.
[3269.02 → 3269.84] But rather,
[3269.96 → 3270.60] at the heart
[3270.60 → 3271.46] of this request
[3271.46 → 3273.24] is to be restored
[3273.24 → 3274.66] in a right relationship
[3274.66 → 3276.10] with God himself.
[3277.06 → 3277.52] He's saying,
[3277.84 → 3278.02] Lord,
[3278.16 → 3279.12] take us back.
[3280.30 → 3280.44] Right?
[3280.58 → 3282.16] Mend the relationship here.
[3282.26 → 3283.30] We have sinned.
[3283.76 → 3284.48] You have turned
[3284.48 → 3285.66] your face away from us.
[3286.56 → 3288.10] You have judged us
[3288.10 → 3288.72] in our sin.
[3289.84 → 3290.06] Lord,
[3290.18 → 3292.36] we want you back.
[3292.86 → 3293.84] We want to be restored
[3293.84 → 3294.72] in relationship with you.
[3294.78 → 3296.22] That is the most important thing.
[3297.14 → 3298.54] And the rest will follow.
[3300.52 → 3300.76] So,
[3300.76 → 3302.38] now you might be wondering
[3302.38 → 3303.88] about verse 22.
[3304.66 → 3306.30] Because the last verse
[3306.30 → 3307.18] at the very end
[3307.18 → 3308.04] of the entire book
[3308.04 → 3308.78] of Lamentations,
[3309.12 → 3310.72] it ends on a pretty
[3310.72 → 3311.76] sombre note.
[3312.66 → 3313.10] So,
[3313.18 → 3314.02] this is what it says.
[3314.76 → 3315.90] Unless you have
[3315.90 → 3317.76] utterly rejected us
[3317.76 → 3318.62] and are angry
[3318.62 → 3320.14] with us beyond measure.
[3321.92 → 3322.98] That's how the book
[3322.98 → 3324.32] of Lamentations ends.
[3325.16 → 3325.66] Right?
[3325.72 → 3327.16] With this question
[3327.16 → 3329.20] kind of just hanging
[3329.20 → 3330.28] in the air.
[3330.94 → 3332.62] Unless you have rejected us.
[3332.62 → 3334.30] unless you are still
[3334.30 → 3335.28] angry with us.
[3336.58 → 3338.14] Will God answer
[3338.14 → 3339.70] that prayer
[3339.70 → 3341.60] to be restored to him?
[3342.72 → 3344.08] It's not resolved.
[3345.34 → 3346.38] It's a question.
[3347.18 → 3348.22] And it's kind of interesting
[3348.22 → 3350.42] that in some Jewish synagogues,
[3350.58 → 3352.48] they don't read verse 22.
[3353.56 → 3355.12] Because it's just unthinkable.
[3355.12 → 3357.00] It's like we don't even
[3357.00 → 3358.86] want to consider that.
[3359.14 → 3359.76] That God
[3359.76 → 3360.68] has rejected
[3360.68 → 3361.30] his people
[3361.30 → 3361.94] forever.
[3363.24 → 3364.10] And so what they do
[3364.10 → 3365.04] is they read
[3365.04 → 3366.02] verse 22
[3366.02 → 3366.88] or 21
[3366.88 → 3367.40] twice.
[3368.12 → 3368.80] And they just
[3368.80 → 3369.52] skip 22.
[3370.18 → 3370.76] In the end,
[3370.98 → 3371.44] they reverse
[3371.44 → 3372.38] the book
[3372.38 → 3372.86] that way.
[3374.42 → 3375.44] But this is where
[3375.44 → 3376.08] you and I
[3376.08 → 3376.82] as Christians
[3376.82 → 3377.84] have the advantage.
[3378.32 → 3379.44] Because we read
[3379.44 → 3380.52] the book of Lamentations
[3380.52 → 3381.48] in the context
[3381.48 → 3382.54] of both the Old Testament
[3382.54 → 3383.82] and of the New Testament.
[3383.82 → 3386.18] We have the advantage
[3386.18 → 3386.90] of seeing
[3386.90 → 3388.20] the answer
[3388.20 → 3389.58] to the question
[3389.58 → 3391.08] of Jeremiah's prayer.
[3392.02 → 3392.60] And so you see
[3392.60 → 3393.90] for a long time,
[3394.08 → 3395.38] it was a long time later,
[3395.96 → 3396.54] but Jerusalem
[3396.54 → 3397.74] eventually is rebuilt.
[3398.02 → 3399.00] The temple is rebuilt.
[3399.84 → 3400.98] Some of God's people
[3400.98 → 3402.18] who were in exile
[3402.18 → 3402.54] in Babylon
[3402.54 → 3403.24] for 70 years,
[3403.32 → 3404.54] they return to the land.
[3405.10 → 3406.10] Life goes on.
[3406.84 → 3407.74] The Roman Empire
[3407.74 → 3408.74] rises up.
[3408.88 → 3409.58] Jerusalem and Judah
[3409.58 → 3410.46] become part of it.
[3411.84 → 3412.46] And still,
[3412.62 → 3413.46] Jeremiah's question
[3413.46 → 3414.44] after all that time
[3414.44 → 3415.50] is still hanging
[3415.50 → 3416.20] in the air.
[3416.60 → 3417.96] Lord, will you restore us?
[3418.26 → 3420.10] Lord, have you rejected us forever?
[3420.36 → 3421.68] That question is still there.
[3423.78 → 3424.78] And then what we see
[3424.78 → 3425.70] is that God finally
[3425.70 → 3427.02] answers that prayer.
[3427.82 → 3428.72] And he does it
[3428.72 → 3429.38] not by coming
[3429.38 → 3429.96] and fixing
[3429.96 → 3431.16] all of their problems,
[3432.00 → 3433.70] not by making things
[3433.70 → 3434.86] go back to the way
[3434.86 → 3435.60] they used to be,
[3435.70 → 3436.70] some golden age,
[3437.12 → 3438.16] if life was just back
[3438.16 → 3438.68] like that
[3438.68 → 3439.50] and all of our problems
[3439.50 → 3439.98] were gone.
[3440.78 → 3442.18] He doesn't do it like that,
[3442.18 → 3443.00] but he comes
[3443.00 → 3444.18] with his presence.
[3444.98 → 3446.04] He comes in the person
[3446.04 → 3446.86] of Jesus Christ.
[3447.22 → 3447.98] God's answer
[3447.98 → 3449.92] to Jeremiah's prayer
[3449.92 → 3450.62] and question
[3450.62 → 3451.90] is Jesus.
[3452.54 → 3453.30] That's the answer.
[3453.90 → 3455.22] Jesus was called Emmanuel.
[3456.00 → 3456.84] What does it mean?
[3458.32 → 3460.02] God with us.
[3460.68 → 3461.60] God with us.
[3462.86 → 3463.26] Now,
[3463.64 → 3465.58] does God become human
[3465.58 → 3466.12] in Jesus
[3466.12 → 3467.62] in order to then
[3467.62 → 3468.32] come among us
[3468.32 → 3468.76] and say,
[3469.34 → 3470.10] stop crying.
[3471.36 → 3472.38] Stop lamenting.
[3472.46 → 3472.98] I'm here.
[3473.26 → 3473.92] It's all fine.
[3473.98 → 3474.36] I'm going to make
[3474.36 → 3475.28] everything new again.
[3476.24 → 3476.68] No,
[3476.86 → 3477.58] that's not what we see
[3477.58 → 3478.24] Jesus do.
[3479.54 → 3480.42] What we see
[3480.42 → 3481.34] in the life of Jesus
[3481.34 → 3482.42] is God entering
[3482.42 → 3483.12] into
[3483.12 → 3485.12] his people's lament.
[3486.12 → 3487.34] Even though
[3487.34 → 3487.98] he has come
[3487.98 → 3488.80] to be with us,
[3489.28 → 3489.98] he has come
[3489.98 → 3491.04] to restore us
[3491.04 → 3492.18] to himself,
[3493.18 → 3494.08] and yet
[3494.08 → 3494.88] he comes to
[3494.88 → 3496.58] join us
[3496.58 → 3497.02] in lament.
[3498.06 → 3499.24] And we saw that
[3499.24 → 3499.92] in our first
[3499.92 → 3500.50] scripture reading
[3500.50 → 3501.36] in the Gospel of John.
[3502.34 → 3503.78] Jesus' response
[3503.78 → 3504.50] to his friend
[3504.50 → 3505.56] Lazarus' death
[3505.56 → 3506.42] shows us
[3506.42 → 3507.94] what it looks like
[3507.94 → 3508.54] to lament.
[3509.18 → 3510.36] Even while knowing
[3510.36 → 3511.34] that God will bring
[3511.34 → 3512.18] renewal and restoration.
[3513.18 → 3513.60] So again,
[3513.74 → 3514.60] here's what happens.
[3514.76 → 3515.34] Here's the story.
[3515.72 → 3517.14] Jesus' friend Lazarus
[3517.14 → 3518.46] has died
[3518.46 → 3519.66] while Jesus was away
[3519.66 → 3520.62] doing other ministry
[3520.62 → 3521.10] and work.
[3522.24 → 3523.42] Jesus comes back
[3523.42 → 3524.70] to the place
[3524.70 → 3525.82] where Lazarus
[3525.82 → 3526.44] is buried
[3526.44 → 3528.10] and his friend
[3528.10 → 3528.68] has been dead
[3528.68 → 3529.54] for four days.
[3531.24 → 3532.76] What does Jesus say
[3532.76 → 3534.56] and what does Jesus do?
[3536.18 → 3537.34] Mary comes out
[3537.34 → 3538.38] to meet him
[3538.38 → 3539.26] with her tears.
[3540.38 → 3541.46] Mary's trust
[3541.46 → 3541.98] in Jesus,
[3542.10 → 3542.58] her faith,
[3542.66 → 3543.30] her theology
[3543.30 → 3544.62] is rock solid.
[3545.50 → 3545.72] Right?
[3545.76 → 3546.50] What does Mary say?
[3546.92 → 3547.44] Mary says,
[3547.56 → 3547.86] Jesus,
[3548.40 → 3549.82] you could have
[3549.82 → 3550.80] saved Lazarus.
[3552.22 → 3552.78] True.
[3553.98 → 3554.94] That is true.
[3554.94 → 3556.88] Mary also says,
[3556.88 → 3558.24] I know he will be
[3558.24 → 3558.84] resurrected
[3558.84 → 3560.08] on the last day
[3560.08 → 3560.94] at the end of time.
[3561.38 → 3562.20] Also true.
[3564.30 → 3564.66] Now,
[3564.94 → 3565.68] here's the question.
[3566.00 → 3566.94] Is that a reason
[3566.94 → 3567.80] for Mary
[3567.80 → 3568.82] not to weep?
[3570.36 → 3571.48] Maybe we would think
[3571.48 → 3572.02] that Jesus
[3572.02 → 3573.54] would correct her
[3573.54 → 3573.82] and say,
[3573.90 → 3574.22] Mary,
[3574.72 → 3576.06] if you just believed
[3576.06 → 3576.80] these things
[3576.80 → 3577.64] a little better,
[3578.24 → 3578.82] you wouldn't be
[3578.82 → 3579.46] so sad.
[3579.96 → 3580.10] Right?
[3580.10 → 3581.58] Stop your fussing.
[3581.82 → 3582.52] Have faith.
[3583.34 → 3584.28] I'm here to renew
[3584.28 → 3584.72] everything.
[3585.50 → 3586.58] Does Jesus say that?
[3586.92 → 3587.32] No.
[3587.66 → 3588.84] He doesn't say that.
[3589.66 → 3590.84] What does Jesus do?
[3591.20 → 3592.04] He does not
[3592.04 → 3592.98] rebuke her tears.
[3593.42 → 3594.58] He joins
[3594.58 → 3595.84] her tears.
[3596.92 → 3597.20] Right?
[3597.32 → 3598.56] He shares
[3598.56 → 3599.44] her tears.
[3600.40 → 3601.54] Jesus knows
[3601.54 → 3602.18] that he is going
[3602.18 → 3603.24] to raise Lazarus,
[3603.30 → 3604.00] which he does
[3604.00 → 3604.70] in just a moment.
[3604.70 → 3607.46] But he does not
[3607.46 → 3608.02] use that
[3608.02 → 3608.86] as a reason
[3608.86 → 3609.98] to avoid
[3609.98 → 3611.42] his own pain
[3611.42 → 3612.00] and grief
[3612.00 → 3613.82] or the pain
[3613.82 → 3614.12] and grief
[3614.12 → 3614.62] of others.
[3615.72 → 3616.70] Jesus weeps
[3616.70 → 3617.84] for Lazarus.
[3618.08 → 3618.36] And friends,
[3618.40 → 3618.92] it's the same way
[3618.92 → 3619.30] with us.
[3619.40 → 3620.32] We know that God
[3620.32 → 3621.06] will come and renew
[3621.06 → 3621.64] all things.
[3621.88 → 3622.98] That is not a reason
[3622.98 → 3624.90] for us to then
[3624.90 → 3625.32] say,
[3625.44 → 3625.58] well,
[3626.46 → 3627.84] we don't have to weep.
[3628.14 → 3629.04] We don't have to lament.
[3629.82 → 3630.54] God's going to restore
[3630.54 → 3630.98] everything,
[3631.18 → 3631.96] so why are you crying?
[3632.06 → 3632.30] No.
[3632.30 → 3634.54] We still,
[3634.64 → 3635.52] it's not an excuse.
[3635.88 → 3636.60] We still weep
[3636.60 → 3637.62] because Jesus wept.
[3638.42 → 3639.14] He teaches us
[3639.14 → 3639.94] what it looks like.
[3641.68 → 3642.24] Now,
[3642.34 → 3643.20] after that,
[3643.54 → 3644.24] what happens?
[3644.44 → 3645.16] Jesus raises
[3645.16 → 3646.18] Lazarus from the dead,
[3646.52 → 3647.64] even though he's
[3647.64 → 3648.80] overcome by sorrow.
[3650.20 → 3650.92] And then he goes
[3650.92 → 3652.14] riding into Jerusalem
[3652.14 → 3653.54] in what we call
[3653.54 → 3654.16] Palm Sunday,
[3654.26 → 3654.92] which we are going
[3654.92 → 3655.40] to celebrate
[3655.40 → 3655.96] as a church
[3655.96 → 3656.72] next week.
[3658.76 → 3659.90] And as Jesus
[3659.90 → 3661.46] rides into Jerusalem,
[3661.46 → 3663.32] God himself
[3663.32 → 3664.80] physically,
[3665.04 → 3665.62] as the person
[3665.62 → 3666.32] of Jesus Christ,
[3666.74 → 3667.88] enters into the city
[3667.88 → 3669.18] that over 600 years
[3669.18 → 3670.54] earlier cried out
[3670.54 → 3671.08] to God
[3671.08 → 3672.12] for his presence
[3672.12 → 3672.50] and said,
[3672.66 → 3672.86] Lord,
[3672.98 → 3674.48] why do you forget us?
[3676.44 → 3676.72] Well,
[3676.76 → 3677.70] God did not forget,
[3677.84 → 3678.12] did he?
[3678.62 → 3679.38] He remembered.
[3679.66 → 3680.72] He did not reject
[3680.72 → 3681.22] them forever.
[3682.52 → 3683.40] And Jesus,
[3683.66 → 3684.22] God himself,
[3684.34 → 3685.50] he comes to his people.
[3685.80 → 3686.92] He comes to the city.
[3687.76 → 3689.02] He restores his presence
[3689.02 → 3689.52] to them.
[3689.52 → 3691.26] And he's in Jerusalem
[3691.26 → 3692.90] and on this very same ground
[3692.90 → 3695.34] where the 600 years earlier,
[3695.48 → 3696.24] the first temple
[3696.24 → 3697.28] had been destroyed
[3697.28 → 3698.34] by the Babylonians.
[3698.90 → 3699.92] Jesus says something
[3699.92 → 3700.62] very interesting
[3700.62 → 3702.38] and something
[3702.38 → 3703.24] that was very confusing
[3703.24 → 3704.10] to the people
[3704.10 → 3704.56] who heard.
[3705.66 → 3706.24] Jesus said,
[3706.84 → 3707.34] this temple
[3707.34 → 3709.78] is going to be torn down
[3709.78 → 3710.44] and rebuilt
[3710.44 → 3711.32] in three days.
[3712.60 → 3713.84] But he wasn't talking
[3713.84 → 3714.48] about the brick
[3714.48 → 3715.24] and mortar temple,
[3715.60 → 3716.88] the brick and mortar building.
[3716.88 → 3717.90] He was talking
[3717.90 → 3718.62] about himself.
[3719.34 → 3719.92] He was talking
[3719.92 → 3721.74] about his own future death
[3721.74 → 3722.80] and resurrection.
[3723.94 → 3724.96] Jesus is saying
[3724.96 → 3727.66] he is the true temple.
[3728.30 → 3731.12] Jesus is God's presence
[3731.12 → 3732.54] with his people.
[3734.08 → 3734.38] So,
[3734.70 → 3735.72] just think about it like this,
[3735.78 → 3735.96] okay?
[3736.04 → 3737.24] In the book of Lamentations,
[3737.68 → 3738.88] the people of God
[3738.88 → 3740.02] are lamenting
[3740.02 → 3741.34] because of the pain
[3741.34 → 3743.04] of God destroying
[3743.04 → 3744.96] his own brick
[3744.96 → 3746.56] and mortar temple
[3746.56 → 3748.56] in the city of Jerusalem
[3748.56 → 3749.78] which removed
[3749.78 → 3750.38] his presence
[3750.38 → 3751.04] from his people
[3751.04 → 3751.82] in judgment
[3751.82 → 3752.76] because of their sin.
[3753.30 → 3754.08] That's what's going on
[3754.08 → 3754.70] in Lamentations.
[3755.24 → 3755.64] And now,
[3755.76 → 3757.08] 600 years later,
[3757.24 → 3757.62] Jesus,
[3759.42 → 3760.52] who is God himself,
[3760.96 → 3761.48] comes to be
[3761.48 → 3762.32] with his people,
[3762.98 → 3764.04] he destroys
[3764.04 → 3765.82] his own flesh
[3765.82 → 3766.80] and blood temple
[3766.80 → 3767.92] on the cross
[3767.92 → 3768.96] as judgment
[3768.96 → 3770.72] for our wickedness,
[3771.06 → 3772.50] not to remove
[3772.50 → 3773.54] his presence from us,
[3774.04 → 3774.68] but so that
[3774.68 → 3776.52] he could restore us
[3776.52 → 3777.36] to his presence.
[3778.94 → 3779.18] Right?
[3779.28 → 3780.84] Because of Jesus Christ,
[3780.94 → 3781.58] you and I
[3781.58 → 3783.24] can read verse 22
[3783.24 → 3784.92] without fear
[3784.92 → 3787.52] because we know
[3787.52 → 3788.24] the answer
[3788.24 → 3788.92] to the question.
[3789.30 → 3790.22] Will God
[3790.22 → 3791.76] reject us?
[3791.76 → 3793.54] the answer is
[3793.54 → 3794.52] no.
[3795.52 → 3796.68] I will not
[3796.68 → 3797.34] reject you.
[3797.64 → 3797.88] No,
[3798.04 → 3798.90] I will not
[3798.90 → 3799.76] remain angry
[3799.76 → 3800.48] with you forever.
[3800.70 → 3801.88] I am coming to you.
[3802.30 → 3802.88] I am coming
[3802.88 → 3803.52] to bring you
[3803.52 → 3804.42] into my presence
[3804.42 → 3804.98] in order
[3804.98 → 3806.14] to bring you home
[3806.14 → 3807.40] to me.
[3809.28 → 3809.82] And so friends,
[3809.92 → 3810.68] in our lament,
[3810.98 → 3811.10] right,
[3811.16 → 3812.26] as we pray
[3812.26 → 3813.08] prayers of lament,
[3813.16 → 3814.60] as we turn to God,
[3815.46 → 3816.00] as we
[3816.00 → 3818.08] complain before him,
[3818.58 → 3819.28] as we then
[3819.28 → 3820.40] trust in God
[3820.40 → 3821.40] and we ask God
[3821.40 → 3822.38] to restore us
[3822.38 → 3823.28] to himself,
[3823.54 → 3824.46] he does.
[3825.02 → 3825.72] And he does so
[3825.72 → 3826.48] in Jesus Christ.
[3828.52 → 3829.04] And so that's
[3829.04 → 3829.52] the answer
[3829.52 → 3830.02] to lament,
[3830.18 → 3830.34] friends.
[3830.40 → 3831.62] We turn our eyes
[3831.62 → 3832.46] to Jesus.
[3833.74 → 3834.62] So let's pray.
[3838.10 → 3838.88] Heavenly Father,
[3839.00 → 3839.80] we thank you
[3839.80 → 3841.48] that you
[3841.48 → 3842.34] have come
[3842.34 → 3843.08] to us
[3843.08 → 3844.84] in the midst
[3844.84 → 3845.56] of our darkness,
[3846.16 → 3846.66] in the midst
[3846.66 → 3847.24] of our pain,
[3847.36 → 3847.54] in the midst
[3847.54 → 3848.26] of our suffering.
[3849.18 → 3849.98] We thank you
[3849.98 → 3850.72] that you are not
[3850.72 → 3851.30] a God
[3851.30 → 3852.38] who stands aloof
[3852.38 → 3854.34] and who waits
[3854.34 → 3854.94] for us
[3854.94 → 3856.04] to pull ourselves
[3856.04 → 3856.52] together.
[3857.52 → 3857.98] But rather,
[3858.16 → 3858.30] Lord,
[3858.38 → 3858.94] you've come
[3858.94 → 3859.58] and you've entered
[3859.58 → 3860.58] into our suffering.
[3860.98 → 3861.90] You've taken on
[3861.90 → 3862.56] lament
[3862.56 → 3864.28] onto your lips.
[3864.84 → 3865.36] You took it
[3865.36 → 3866.10] into your body.
[3866.78 → 3867.32] You've suffered
[3867.32 → 3868.16] for this world
[3868.16 → 3869.24] so that you
[3869.24 → 3870.10] could restore us.
[3871.56 → 3872.54] You have died
[3872.54 → 3873.20] and you've risen
[3873.20 → 3873.74] again
[3873.74 → 3875.36] so that we
[3875.36 → 3876.10] could be made new.
[3877.04 → 3877.28] And so,
[3877.42 → 3877.50] Lord,
[3877.56 → 3878.30] we put our hope
[3878.30 → 3878.66] in you.
[3879.66 → 3880.26] We ask
[3880.26 → 3880.82] that you
[3880.82 → 3881.52] will right
[3881.52 → 3882.40] all wrongs,
[3882.66 → 3883.10] that you
[3883.10 → 3883.76] will wipe
[3883.76 → 3884.68] away every tear,
[3884.94 → 3885.36] and that you
[3885.36 → 3885.66] will make
[3885.66 → 3886.24] all things new.
[3886.38 → 3886.74] We pray
[3886.74 → 3887.24] in your name.
[3887.74 → 3888.00] Amen.
[3888.00 → 3888.08] Amen.
[3899.04 → 3900.22] Let's stand to sing.
[3900.22 → 3902.16] Amen.
[3910.68 → 3911.26] Amen.
[3911.38 → 3911.52] and
[3911.52 → 3911.84] behind
[3911.90 → 3912.34] this
[3912.34 → 3935.00] O Lord our God, to You, we come
[3935.00 → 3940.54] Will You still hide Your face?
[3940.54 → 3947.58] We cry before You and on our knees we pray
[3947.58 → 3952.02] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[3952.02 → 3960.62] Our sorrows leave us weak and moan
[3960.62 → 3965.74] Surrounded by our fears
[3965.74 → 3972.78] We look to heaven, come, feeble, fray and tears
[3972.78 → 3977.82] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[3977.82 → 3983.82] Till Your glory fills our eyes
[3983.82 → 3987.82] And our faith is turned to sight
[3987.82 → 3994.86] Till our thirsty souls are satisfied
[3994.86 → 4001.90] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4001.90 → 4007.90] Our foes and enemies rejoice
[4007.90 → 4012.62] In justice seems to reign
[4012.62 → 4019.66] Though we are shaken, and we are losing strength
[4019.66 → 4024.70] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4024.70 → 4028.70] Till Your glory fills our eyes
[4028.70 → 4033.70] And our faith is turned to sight
[4033.70 → 4040.62] Till our thirsty souls are satisfied
[4040.62 → 4045.66] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4045.66 → 4060.70] O Lord, O Lord
[4060.70 → 4066.70] But we will trust Your steadfast love
[4066.70 → 4069.74] Your grace will be our song
[4069.74 → 4071.74] Your grace will be our song
[4071.74 → 4072.78] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4072.78 → 4078.78] Bring new mercies in every rising sun
[4078.78 → 4081.82] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4081.82 → 4083.82] O Lord, O Lord
[4083.82 → 4087.82] Till Your glory fills our eyes
[4087.82 → 4093.82] And our faith is turned to sight
[4093.82 → 4099.82] Till our thirsty souls are satisfied
[4099.82 → 4105.82] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4105.82 → 4108.86] And our faith is turned to sight
[4108.86 → 4110.86] O Lord, O Lord
[4110.86 → 4112.86] And our faith is turned to sight
[4112.86 → 4114.86] O Lord, O Lord, O Lord
[4114.86 → 4116.86] Let me see
[4116.86 → 4126.86] At this point I'd like to invite the deacons up
[4126.86 → 4128.86] to collect this morning offering
[4128.86 → 4130.78] which is for local church ministries
[4130.78 → 4132.92] and as it says on the screen there
[4132.92 → 4135.24] our local church ministries fund
[4135.24 → 4137.30] goes towards things like gems
[4137.30 → 4138.20] and cross-training
[4138.20 → 4140.14] friendship and Chinese ministries
[4140.14 → 4142.20] of course many of us are involved
[4142.20 → 4142.92] in these ministries
[4142.92 → 4144.82], so please give as you are able
[4144.82 → 4150.34] thank you so much for a
[4150.34 → 4156.08] поэтому we're going to be doing
[4156.08 → 4158.26] John D. fellow
[4158.28 → 4168.14] following month
[4168.14 → 4169.14] Amen.
[4198.14 → 4200.14] Amen.
[4228.14 → 4230.14] Amen.
[4258.14 → 4260.14] Amen.
[4288.14 → 4290.14] Amen.
[4318.14 → 4320.14] Amen.
[4320.14 → 4321.14] Amen.
[4321.14 → 4322.14] Amen.
[4322.14 → 4323.14] Amen.
[4323.14 → 4324.14] Amen.
[4324.14 → 4325.14] Amen.
[4325.14 → 4326.14] Amen.
[4326.14 → 4327.14] Amen.
[4327.14 → 4328.14] Amen.
[4328.14 → 4329.14] Amen.
[4329.14 → 4330.14] Amen.
[4330.14 → 4331.14] Amen.
[4331.14 → 4332.14] Amen.
[4332.14 → 4333.14] Amen.
[4333.14 → 4334.14] Amen.
[4334.14 → 4336.14] Amen.
[4336.14 → 4337.14] Amen.
[4337.14 → 4338.14] Amen.
[4338.14 → 4339.14] Amen.
[4339.14 → 4340.14] Amen.
[4340.14 → 4345.14] Our God invites us to join in a petition to him with our prayers.
[4345.14 → 4350.14] So let's come together as a community and pray before God.
[4351.14 → 4357.14] Loving ever-present God, we bring before you the prayers of our broken world.
[4357.14 → 4363.14] You are a God who is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in love and mercy.
[4363.14 → 4368.14] We ask then, Lord, for a full measure of this mercy this morning.
[4368.14 → 4374.14] For we live in an anxious and troubled world where the burdens are heavy and there is much suffering.
[4374.14 → 4381.14] Our leaders have turned their backs on peace and unity and have chosen strife and even violence as a path forward.
[4381.14 → 4386.14] Arrogance and self-gratification now rules the day.
[4386.14 → 4393.14] In many places over the world, the lamps are going out, and we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.
[4393.14 → 4406.14] Though far from home, we see bloodshed in Myanmar, Gaza, Ukraine, Haiti, Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
[4406.14 → 4408.14] And we are appalled.
[4408.14 → 4412.14] And yet, we are helpless.
[4412.14 → 4433.14] We pray, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[4433.14 → 4438.14] Your kingdom seems so distant to us now.
[4438.14 → 4442.14] We pray, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[4442.14 → 4447.14] O Lord, may revenge and hatred give way to tolerance and understanding.
[4447.14 → 4451.14] Turn the hearts of our leaders towards peace and away from anger.
[4451.14 → 4458.14] We pray, especially for the many places in the world where political instability is all they have ever known.
[4458.14 → 4466.14] While we here in Ladder worry about things that we read in the news, many suffer through it every day.
[4466.14 → 4470.14] We covet our neighbour's possessions.
[4470.14 → 4473.14] We are not satisfied with the many blessings you have poured out.
[4473.14 → 4477.14] Help us to be content with the abundance you have given us.
[4477.14 → 4480.14] Woe to us, for we have sinned.
[4480.14 → 4485.14] If you, O Lord, would mark our transgressions, who would stand?
[4485.14 → 4488.14] But with you is found forgiveness.
[4488.14 → 4491.14] You, Lord, reign forever.
[4491.14 → 4495.14] Your throne endures from generation to generation.
[4495.14 → 4498.14] Do not forget us, Lord.
[4501.14 → 4504.14] We pray for mercy.
[4504.14 → 4509.14] Be with the friends and families of those who have lost their lives in Myanmar and Thailand
[4509.14 → 4512.14] during last week's devastating earthquake.
[4512.14 → 4522.14] Again, we ask that mercy and love overcomes oppression, allowing the aid workers and rescue workers to prevent further death and suffering.
[4522.14 → 4532.14] And closer to home, we ask you to heal the many in our midst struggling with health issues, with pain, suffering, and yes, even death.
[4532.14 → 4545.14] We bring before you those in our church and our community dealing with unseen suffering such as mental illness, addiction, depression, and with loss and with loneliness.
[4545.14 → 4549.14] We pray for those living on the street, unsure of where their next meal will come from.
[4549.14 → 4564.14] Help us to see the value in every person, to see them as you see them.
[4564.14 → 4579.14] Merciful God, we pray this morning for Pat, Ellie, Carl, Shirley, Eileen, Diane, Hank and Liz, Ted, and Tony.
[4579.14 → 4592.14] We pray for Robin and her sister who suffers from MS, and for Michael and his family, as Michael has been diagnosed with cancer and is dealing with much suffering.
[4592.14 → 4595.14] We weep with Michael and his family.
[4595.14 → 4599.14] Be with the health and caregivers.
[4599.14 → 4604.14] May they make wise decisions, and may they be gentle and merciful.
[4604.14 → 4608.14] We lift all of these up to you, Lord.
[4608.14 → 4611.14] Wipe the tears from their faces.
[4611.14 → 4614.14] May they know that they are loved.
[4614.14 → 4619.14] Grant strength and healing and hope to those who stand in need.
[4619.14 → 4624.14] While we are often helpless, you are the great physician and the wonderful counsellor.
[4624.14 → 4628.14] We know you are a God that suffers with us and for us.
[4628.14 → 4631.14] You walk among us and fill us up with your spirit.
[4631.14 → 4635.14] Help us to always look to you when we struggle.
[4635.14 → 4638.14] In Jesus' powerful name we pray.
[4638.14 → 4639.14] Amen.
[4639.14 → 4652.14] Let's all rise.
[4652.14 → 4653.14] Amen.
[4653.14 → 4654.14] Amen.
[4654.14 → 4657.14] It's great to be with you in worshipping the Lord today.
[4657.14 → 4664.14] Join us for a time of fellowship, right through coffee and right through the doors there into the fellowship hall.
[4664.14 → 4667.14] And if you are new, I would love to meet you today.
[4667.14 → 4672.14] And I invite you now to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving the Lord's blessing.
[4672.14 → 4680.14] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God our Father, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us now and always.
[4680.14 → 4681.14] Amen.
[4681.14 → 4695.14] May the peace of God our heavenly Father, and the grace of Christ that is inside, and the grace of Christ that is inside, and the ways of God our heavenly Father.
[4695.14 → 4704.46] May the peace of God our heavenly Father
[4704.46 → 4709.94] And the grace of Christ the risen Son
[4709.94 → 4715.66] And the fellowship of God the Spirit
[4715.66 → 4721.34] Keep our hearts and minds within His blood
[4721.34 → 4727.10] And to Him, we praise for His glorious light
[4727.10 → 4732.64] From the depths of earth to the heights of heaven
[4732.64 → 4736.98] We declare the name of the Lord
[4736.98 → 4744.30] One slain, Christ eternal, the King of kings
[4744.30 → 4756.58] May this peace which has His understanding
[4756.58 → 4762.06] And this grace which makes us what we are
[4762.06 → 4767.44] And His fellowship of His communion
[4767.44 → 4772.30] Be God's heart in spirit and in heart
[4772.30 → 4778.06] And to Him, we praise for His glorious light
[4778.06 → 4784.12] From the depths of earth to the heights of heaven
[4784.12 → 4789.76] We declare the name of the Lamb once slain
[4789.76 → 4795.28] Christ eternal, the King of kings
[4795.28 → 4801.04] Christ eternal, the King of kings
