[1949.44 → 1979.42] Thank you.
[1979.44 → 2009.42] Amen.
[2009.44 → 2039.42] So, good morning.
[2039.42 → 2069.38] seaweed but, yeah.
[2069.42 → 2078.34] And each one tearfully remembers the destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians in 586 BC.
[2079.30 → 2082.64] So the Babylonian army came, and they sacked the city.
[2082.78 → 2084.32] They tore down the walls.
[2085.20 → 2091.22] The temple, the place where God had dwelt with his people, was devastated.
[2091.72 → 2098.34] Men, women, and children were killed or enslaved and taken into exile or left to die.
[2100.42 → 2107.70] And Lamentations, this book, is a poetic response to the destruction that they experienced.
[2109.02 → 2117.30] And so in that way, what we have in this book of Lamentations are God-breathed words to help us.
[2117.62 → 2124.02] To help us and to guide us in what it means to cry out to him.
[2124.02 → 2132.78] How to cry out to him in our own suffering, in our own pain, in our own confusion in this world.
[2134.62 → 2140.92] And now, the chapters of Lamentations are a good bit longer than what we normally read.
[2140.92 → 2145.10] So we're going to start off this morning by reading Lamentations chapter 2.
[2145.26 → 2146.66] And we'll read the first 10 verses.
[2148.12 → 2152.08] So I invite you to open your Bibles.
[2152.18 → 2157.86] The words will be on the screen, but I will be referring to different verses along as I go.
[2158.06 → 2162.74] So this is a particularly good Sunday to have the Bible in front of you.
[2163.44 → 2164.58] Just a recommendation.
[2164.58 → 2167.42] But Lamentations chapter 2.
[2167.50 → 2169.64] It's on page 615 of your pre-Bible.
[2173.04 → 2174.00] Page 615.
[2175.92 → 2177.14] Lamentations chapter 2.
[2177.58 → 2180.14] And we'll just read verses 1 through 10 to begin.
[2181.58 → 2183.40] So let's give our attention to the reading of God's word.
[2183.40 → 2190.66] How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud of his anger.
[2191.76 → 2196.94] He has hurled down the splendour of Israel from heaven to earth.
[2197.82 → 2201.56] He has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
[2202.72 → 2207.08] Without pity, the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob.
[2207.98 → 2212.48] In his wrath, he has torn down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.
[2212.48 → 2218.24] He has brought her kingdom and its priests down to the ground in dishonour.
[2219.52 → 2223.02] In fierce anger, he has cut off every horn of Israel.
[2223.60 → 2226.56] He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy.
[2227.08 → 2231.32] He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
[2232.30 → 2234.44] Like an enemy, he has strung his bow.
[2235.06 → 2236.26] His right hand is ready.
[2236.84 → 2240.02] Like a foe, he has slain all who are pleasing to the eye.
[2240.02 → 2245.22] He has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the daughter of Zion.
[2246.18 → 2247.68] The Lord is like an enemy.
[2247.90 → 2249.06] He has swallowed up Israel.
[2249.54 → 2253.68] He has swallowed up all of her palaces and destroyed her strongholds.
[2254.16 → 2257.80] He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the daughter of Judah.
[2258.20 → 2260.54] He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden.
[2261.06 → 2263.02] He has destroyed his place of meeting.
[2263.02 → 2267.50] The Lord has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths.
[2268.28 → 2271.44] In his fierce anger, he has spurned both king and priest.
[2272.60 → 2275.78] The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary.
[2276.28 → 2279.16] He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces.
[2280.16 → 2285.16] They have raised a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of an appointed feast.
[2285.16 → 2290.84] The Lord determined to tear down the wall around the daughter of Zion.
[2291.20 → 2294.94] He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying.
[2295.66 → 2297.66] He made ramparts and walls lament.
[2298.28 → 2299.58] Together they wasted away.
[2300.86 → 2302.74] Her gates have sunk into the ground.
[2302.94 → 2304.88] Their bars he has broken and destroyed.
[2305.36 → 2308.36] Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations.
[2308.76 → 2309.94] The law is no more.
[2310.94 → 2314.06] And her prophets no longer find visions from the Lord.
[2314.06 → 2321.08] The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence.
[2322.46 → 2325.98] They have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth.
[2326.58 → 2330.56] The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
[2331.40 → 2332.62] This is the word of the Lord.
[2337.48 → 2341.04] Let's pray for God's blessing upon the reading and preaching of his word.
[2344.06 → 2347.08] Lord, would you touch our hearts this morning?
[2348.92 → 2351.18] Would you teach us to love what you love?
[2352.22 → 2354.10] Lord, teach us to hate what you hate.
[2354.96 → 2356.92] Teach us to mourn what you mourn.
[2358.06 → 2360.38] Lord, bless the reading and preaching of your word.
[2360.48 → 2365.02] And I pray that anything that is not of you would not be heard and received.
[2365.02 → 2370.00] And I pray that your spirit would convict our hearts of your truth.
[2370.38 → 2371.22] For Christ's sake.
[2371.62 → 2371.88] Amen.
[2374.28 → 2379.02] So there is a radio journalist by the name of Herbert Morrison.
[2379.02 → 2389.44] And one day on May 6, 1937, Herbert was sent out to Manchester Township in New Jersey
[2389.44 → 2394.96] to cover the now infamous landing of the Zeppelin airship known as the Hindenburg.
[2395.58 → 2399.02] The Hindenburg was the largest commercial airship that ever flew.
[2400.10 → 2406.00] And it had already made several trips from Germany across the Atlantic to North America.
[2406.00 → 2411.14] And if you listen to Morrison's famous radio broadcast of that landing,
[2411.28 → 2417.38] it starts out all quite normal as he just reports on the event.
[2418.74 → 2422.10] He explains that it had just started raining.
[2423.66 → 2429.54] He talks about how the motors of the airship are keeping it afloat in the air.
[2429.54 → 2435.46] And then all of a sudden, he yells, it's burst into flames.
[2436.00 → 2439.02] Here's a photo.
[2441.02 → 2445.72] His tone and pace suddenly become frantic.
[2446.44 → 2451.56] He describes the fire that suddenly breaks out before his eyes,
[2451.78 → 2454.92] how this huge airship that had just been floating in the air
[2454.92 → 2458.10] now is engulfed in flames and is falling to the ground.
[2458.10 → 2467.74] And the question that's kind of unavoidably on people's minds during tragedies like this
[2467.74 → 2469.66] is how could this happen?
[2471.64 → 2471.88] Right?
[2471.96 → 2475.06] It's so shocking and sudden and unexpected,
[2476.12 → 2478.94] especially in something that we take so much pride in,
[2479.02 → 2482.08] in the advancement of technology and human ingenuity.
[2482.08 → 2485.94] How could such a thing happen?
[2487.28 → 2491.66] And that's the question that the book of Lamentations asks as well.
[2492.70 → 2497.06] In fact, the Hebrew title of the book is Aka.
[2497.68 → 2498.20] How?
[2499.18 → 2499.92] That's the title.
[2499.92 → 2505.02] It's the word that begins chapters 1, 2, and 4.
[2506.20 → 2507.78] How could this happen?
[2508.96 → 2509.08] Right?
[2509.20 → 2512.02] So Jerusalem, the city of the Lord,
[2512.10 → 2515.78] is the place that Yahweh had chosen to dwell with his people.
[2515.78 → 2525.30] It was the city of King David that he had established as the capital of the promised land.
[2525.86 → 2528.66] It was the city that Solomon had made splendid,
[2529.12 → 2532.50] where he had built the temple of the Lord Yahweh
[2532.50 → 2538.56] and established Jerusalem as the place where the people of God would gather to worship the Lord.
[2539.36 → 2544.90] The place that they would come to remember the mighty deeds and acts of the Lord.
[2545.78 → 2549.56] Now it is utterly desolate.
[2551.40 → 2554.76] And the only response that feels appropriate is,
[2555.32 → 2555.56] How?
[2556.88 → 2559.30] How had it come to this?
[2560.40 → 2564.86] How could Yahweh, the God of Israel, let this happen?
[2566.86 → 2569.12] In Lamentations chapter 2,
[2569.62 → 2572.68] it goes on to provide an answer to some of those questions.
[2572.68 → 2577.12] And this chapter is quite heavy, as you may have noticed.
[2577.82 → 2581.36] It is full of the anguish of God's suffering people.
[2582.56 → 2584.62] And yet, as is always the case,
[2585.54 → 2587.58] the more that we read God's word,
[2587.76 → 2589.44] the more we pray through God's word,
[2590.14 → 2592.20] the more we actually see God's goodness.
[2593.30 → 2595.48] The more we see his love for his children,
[2595.48 → 2597.74] and the more we learn to cling,
[2598.52 → 2601.20] even more so to the promises of God's grace.
[2602.30 → 2604.52] And so as we look at Lamentations chapter 2,
[2604.62 → 2606.34] we're going to see two things this morning.
[2606.66 → 2611.98] First, we're going to see a God who is faithful to judge.
[2613.02 → 2616.80] Sometimes we don't think of that word faithfulness and judgment in the same,
[2617.00 → 2618.94] you know, thought.
[2618.94 → 2621.30] But God is faithful to judge.
[2621.64 → 2622.96] And then the second thing we're going to see
[2622.96 → 2626.88] is that God is faithful to heal, to restore.
[2628.04 → 2630.54] So let's begin with this first point this morning,
[2630.66 → 2633.02] that God is faithful to judge.
[2635.12 → 2638.92] In the years leading up to the fall of Jerusalem,
[2639.08 → 2641.76] this terrible event in 586 BC,
[2641.76 → 2646.92] one of Israel's biggest miscalculations
[2646.92 → 2651.44] was to suppose that regardless of how they lived as God's people,
[2652.16 → 2654.70] that God was so for them.
[2654.84 → 2656.84] He was so pro-Israel
[2656.84 → 2660.34] that he would, of course, let his people off the hook.
[2661.58 → 2661.74] Right?
[2661.78 → 2665.48] That God would never judge his own people.
[2666.88 → 2671.14] And that miscalculation was that they didn't see themselves clearly.
[2671.14 → 2679.14] They didn't see their sin of injustice and oppression and idolatry.
[2679.90 → 2681.76] And they didn't see God clearly.
[2682.20 → 2686.28] They didn't see God in his holiness, in his faithfulness.
[2687.22 → 2689.86] And so throughout these first ten verses of our passage,
[2690.26 → 2693.98] it's as if the prophet Jeremiah is just pulling up the veil
[2693.98 → 2695.52] to show God's people
[2695.52 → 2698.66] that what happened in the destruction of Jerusalem,
[2698.66 → 2703.40] it wasn't just a human historic tragedy.
[2703.74 → 2704.96] Of course, it was that.
[2705.40 → 2706.88] But even more fundamentally,
[2707.38 → 2708.88] it was God's judgment
[2708.88 → 2711.64] against his people
[2711.64 → 2713.04] because of their sin.
[2714.84 → 2717.22] And as we look ahead a bit,
[2717.28 → 2718.34] actually in verse 17,
[2718.60 → 2719.42] this is what it says.
[2719.50 → 2720.36] Very explicitly,
[2720.36 → 2723.22] the Lord has done what he planned.
[2723.58 → 2726.62] He fulfilled his word,
[2727.32 → 2729.42] which he had decreed long ago.
[2730.82 → 2731.30] Right?
[2731.36 → 2732.48] So all that is happening
[2732.48 → 2734.48] in the destruction of the city,
[2734.56 → 2735.76] in the destruction of the temple,
[2735.76 → 2738.98] was exactly as God had told them it would happen
[2738.98 → 2740.78] several centuries earlier,
[2740.90 → 2742.04] back in the book of Deuteronomy.
[2743.04 → 2743.32] Right?
[2743.32 → 2744.80] What had happened
[2744.80 → 2748.72] was God enacting his covenant curses
[2748.72 → 2751.88] that he said would befall his people
[2751.88 → 2755.40] if they broke their relationship with God.
[2756.18 → 2758.64] God said that this would happen.
[2759.60 → 2761.84] And so as we read Jeremiah's report
[2761.84 → 2763.20] on this event,
[2764.02 → 2766.10] especially in these first ten verses,
[2766.34 → 2768.54] it is God who is the subject
[2768.54 → 2771.26] of all of these things that happens.
[2771.26 → 2773.06] So just listen
[2773.06 → 2774.92] to some of the actions
[2774.92 → 2776.00] that are attributed
[2776.00 → 2777.72] to God's doing.
[2778.80 → 2780.02] I'm just going to kind of go through
[2780.02 → 2781.90] and read some of the actions,
[2782.06 → 2783.32] the verbs that we read here.
[2783.76 → 2784.18] It says,
[2784.36 → 2785.32] the Lord, in verse 1,
[2785.62 → 2786.92] has covered Zion
[2786.92 → 2788.74] with a cloud of his anger.
[2789.86 → 2791.98] He has hurled down.
[2792.54 → 2794.46] The Lord has swallowed up.
[2794.86 → 2796.18] He has torn down.
[2796.28 → 2797.20] He has cut off.
[2797.46 → 2799.04] He has withdrawn his hand.
[2799.30 → 2800.60] He has strung his bow.
[2800.60 → 2801.84] He has slain.
[2802.08 → 2803.54] He has poured out his wrath.
[2803.98 → 2805.16] He has laid waste.
[2805.50 → 2806.42] He has destroyed.
[2806.64 → 2807.58] He has spurned.
[2807.64 → 2808.28] He has rejected.
[2810.48 → 2810.96] Right?
[2811.02 → 2813.02] It wasn't just the Babylonian army
[2813.02 → 2814.32] that was doing this,
[2814.38 → 2816.76] but behind them
[2816.76 → 2819.00] was the hand of God.
[2819.14 → 2820.52] God was the main actor.
[2822.58 → 2824.56] And as we read these verses,
[2824.74 → 2826.26] we also see that there was both
[2826.26 → 2828.60] physical, material destruction,
[2828.60 → 2828.66] destruction,
[2829.16 → 2831.64] but there was also spiritual destruction
[2831.64 → 2832.14] as well.
[2833.42 → 2834.68] So physically speaking,
[2835.18 → 2836.56] God had destroyed the homes
[2836.56 → 2837.10] of his people.
[2837.94 → 2839.26] He had torn down the walls.
[2839.58 → 2840.84] He had laid waste to the city.
[2842.28 → 2843.52] Verse 5 says,
[2843.88 → 2845.64] the Lord is like an enemy.
[2846.48 → 2848.28] He has swallowed up Israel.
[2848.42 → 2850.76] He has swallowed up all of her palaces
[2850.76 → 2853.92] and destroyed her strongholds.
[2854.62 → 2854.86] Right?
[2854.92 → 2857.62] The pride of Israel,
[2858.00 → 2858.96] kind of like Babel,
[2859.24 → 2860.14] was torn down.
[2862.70 → 2864.30] But the destruction that God brought
[2864.30 → 2866.50] wasn't just the tearing down of buildings.
[2866.50 → 2869.58] So if you have your Bible open,
[2869.68 → 2870.86] look with me in verse 1.
[2871.56 → 2872.84] At the end of the verse there,
[2872.94 → 2873.46] it says,
[2874.48 → 2876.50] he has not remembered his footstool
[2876.50 → 2877.94] in the day of his judgment.
[2878.46 → 2879.36] That footstool
[2879.36 → 2881.82] is a reference to the Ark of the Covenant
[2881.82 → 2882.52] in the temple.
[2883.02 → 2884.74] This is the place where God's feet
[2884.74 → 2886.56] would rest.
[2887.24 → 2889.50] The place where heaven and earth met.
[2889.50 → 2892.18] But God said,
[2892.36 → 2894.04] he remembered not his footstool.
[2894.76 → 2896.78] He no longer dwelt,
[2897.58 → 2900.14] resided, rested in his sanctuary.
[2901.40 → 2902.50] Verse 6 says,
[2903.66 → 2905.64] he has laid waste his dwelling
[2905.64 → 2906.42] like a garden.
[2906.88 → 2908.90] He has destroyed his place of meeting.
[2909.84 → 2909.94] Right?
[2909.98 → 2910.72] That place of meeting
[2910.72 → 2911.86] is clearly a reference
[2911.86 → 2913.16] to the destruction of the temple.
[2914.28 → 2914.40] Right?
[2914.48 → 2916.56] That divinely appointed meeting place
[2916.56 → 2917.90] between God and his people.
[2917.90 → 2919.10] The place of meeting.
[2919.50 → 2920.74] He destroyed it.
[2921.88 → 2922.72] And when that happened,
[2922.84 → 2923.82] verse 6 continues,
[2924.36 → 2925.48] the Lord has made Zion
[2925.48 → 2927.02] forget her appointed festivals
[2927.02 → 2928.50] and her Sabbaths.
[2929.12 → 2929.28] Right?
[2929.38 → 2931.36] These festivals and feasts,
[2931.58 → 2932.74] the celebrations
[2932.74 → 2933.82] in Israel's life
[2933.82 → 2935.00] that orbited around
[2935.00 → 2936.64] the worship at the temple.
[2938.22 → 2940.46] They celebrated all that God had done
[2940.46 → 2941.54] and who he was.
[2942.54 → 2943.42] They were over.
[2945.50 → 2946.84] No more remembrance
[2946.84 → 2948.20] of God's mighty acts.
[2948.20 → 2949.28] No more celebration
[2949.28 → 2951.76] of their relationship with him.
[2951.76 → 2952.38] He said,
[2952.46 → 2953.48] the party is off.
[2956.60 → 2958.10] Verse 7 says,
[2959.22 → 2961.04] the Lord has rejected his altar
[2961.04 → 2964.28] and abandoned his sanctuary.
[2965.28 → 2965.68] Right?
[2965.72 → 2966.24] The altar
[2966.24 → 2969.42] is located in the outer courtyard
[2969.42 → 2970.06] of the temple.
[2970.52 → 2971.62] It was destroyed.
[2972.92 → 2973.50] And this altar,
[2973.66 → 2974.74] it wasn't just a minor piece
[2974.74 → 2975.18] of furniture.
[2975.18 → 2976.28] This altar
[2976.28 → 2977.52] was the place
[2977.52 → 2978.38] where sacrifices
[2978.38 → 2979.08] were offered
[2979.08 → 2980.42] for the forgiveness
[2980.42 → 2981.04] of sins.
[2982.82 → 2984.16] So its destruction
[2984.16 → 2984.74] then
[2984.74 → 2985.80] brought about
[2985.80 → 2987.14] the terrifying prospect
[2987.14 → 2988.46] for God's people
[2988.46 → 2990.00] that they could no longer
[2990.00 → 2991.08] offer sacrifices
[2991.08 → 2992.02] before the Lord.
[2993.60 → 2994.02] Therefore,
[2994.56 → 2995.56] what hope
[2995.56 → 2996.70] would they have
[2996.70 → 2998.42] to have their
[2998.42 → 2999.18] relationship
[2999.18 → 2999.94] with God repaired?
[3001.18 → 3001.40] Right?
[3001.44 → 3002.80] There were no more sacrifices
[3002.80 → 3003.92] for the forgiveness
[3003.92 → 3004.42] of sin.
[3007.18 → 3008.42] And continuing on
[3008.42 → 3009.00] in verse 9,
[3009.08 → 3009.42] it says,
[3009.54 → 3010.76] the law is no more.
[3011.40 → 3011.90] Her prophets
[3011.90 → 3013.00] no longer find visions
[3013.00 → 3013.62] from the Lord.
[3013.62 → 3013.94] Right?
[3015.22 → 3016.14] No more instruction
[3016.14 → 3017.04] from the Lord.
[3017.58 → 3018.36] No visions
[3018.36 → 3019.56] from Yahweh
[3019.56 → 3020.42] through his prophets.
[3021.28 → 3022.46] No more revelation.
[3022.46 → 3025.28] God closed
[3025.28 → 3026.44] off
[3026.44 → 3028.06] his people's ability
[3028.06 → 3028.98] to hear
[3028.98 → 3029.72] from him
[3029.72 → 3030.44] and to know him.
[3031.48 → 3032.40] He just withdrew
[3032.40 → 3034.58] his relationship
[3034.58 → 3035.28] from them
[3035.28 → 3035.86] in a sense.
[3037.72 → 3037.92] Right?
[3037.98 → 3039.22] Imagine if our access
[3039.22 → 3040.06] to God's word
[3040.06 → 3040.88] was suddenly
[3040.88 → 3041.52] taken away
[3041.52 → 3042.12] completely.
[3043.40 → 3044.40] No Bibles
[3044.40 → 3046.30] that you can read
[3046.30 → 3046.84] on your own.
[3047.28 → 3048.22] No preaching
[3048.22 → 3049.06] of God's word
[3049.06 → 3050.12] in our gathered worship.
[3050.24 → 3051.18] No Bible studies.
[3051.64 → 3051.98] Silence.
[3052.46 → 3053.58] How would you
[3053.58 → 3054.20] know the Lord?
[3058.44 → 3059.40] And again,
[3059.58 → 3060.50] this was all
[3060.50 → 3061.56] the Lord's doing
[3061.56 → 3063.36] through the instrument
[3063.36 → 3064.70] of the Babylonian army.
[3065.70 → 3066.66] And it was all
[3066.66 → 3067.14] as a result
[3067.14 → 3067.76] of their sin.
[3068.92 → 3069.74] We're not told
[3069.74 → 3070.46] that explicitly
[3070.46 → 3071.92] here in Lamentations 2,
[3072.30 → 3073.04] but certainly
[3073.04 → 3073.58] the people
[3073.58 → 3074.30] who were singing
[3074.30 → 3075.24] or crying
[3075.24 → 3076.02] this psalm,
[3076.66 → 3078.92] praying this poem,
[3079.74 → 3080.76] they would have known.
[3080.76 → 3082.42] They knew exactly
[3082.42 → 3083.08] what was happening.
[3084.74 → 3085.42] Because,
[3085.58 → 3086.48] listen to
[3086.48 → 3087.56] what Jeremiah
[3087.56 → 3088.80] writes about
[3088.80 → 3089.64] his ministry
[3089.64 → 3090.28] to Judah,
[3090.62 → 3091.22] to Jerusalem,
[3091.88 → 3092.90] in Jeremiah
[3092.90 → 3095.06] chapter 25.
[3095.64 → 3096.10] Let's read this
[3096.10 → 3096.94] little passage here,
[3097.30 → 3098.16] verses 3 to 7.
[3099.26 → 3100.28] Jeremiah writes,
[3100.28 → 3101.56] for 23 years,
[3101.56 → 3103.84] from the 13th year
[3103.84 → 3104.46] of Josiah,
[3104.60 → 3105.38] son of Ammon,
[3105.84 → 3106.56] king of Judah,
[3106.82 → 3107.92] until this very day,
[3108.92 → 3110.16] the word of the Lord
[3110.16 → 3111.62] has come to me
[3111.62 → 3112.58] and I have spoken
[3112.58 → 3113.30] to you
[3113.30 → 3114.22] again
[3114.22 → 3115.80] and again,
[3116.24 → 3117.36] but you have not
[3117.36 → 3117.72] listened.
[3118.92 → 3120.50] And though the Lord
[3120.50 → 3121.44] has sent all
[3121.44 → 3122.04] of his servants,
[3122.16 → 3122.56] the prophets,
[3122.70 → 3123.02] to you,
[3123.08 → 3124.24] again and again
[3124.24 → 3125.12] you have not listened
[3125.12 → 3126.22] or paid attention.
[3126.22 → 3128.00] They said,
[3128.36 → 3128.98] turn now,
[3129.12 → 3129.66] each of you,
[3129.78 → 3130.92] from your evil ways
[3130.92 → 3132.06] and your evil practices
[3132.06 → 3133.58] and you can stay
[3133.58 → 3134.28] in the land
[3134.28 → 3135.02] that the Lord
[3135.02 → 3135.72] gave to you
[3135.72 → 3136.70] and your ancestors
[3136.70 → 3137.70] forever and ever.
[3138.70 → 3139.46] Do not follow
[3139.46 → 3140.34] other gods
[3140.34 → 3141.42] to serve and worship them.
[3141.64 → 3142.32] Do not arouse
[3142.32 → 3143.04] my anger
[3143.04 → 3144.46] with what your hands
[3144.46 → 3145.08] have made,
[3145.34 → 3146.54] then I will not harm you.
[3147.60 → 3148.32] But you did not
[3148.32 → 3149.08] listen to me,
[3149.34 → 3150.06] declares the Lord,
[3150.56 → 3151.76] and you have aroused
[3151.76 → 3152.46] my anger
[3152.46 → 3153.64] with what your hands
[3153.64 → 3154.18] have made
[3154.18 → 3155.08] and you have brought
[3155.08 → 3156.62] harm to yourselves.
[3159.10 → 3159.50] Right?
[3159.58 → 3161.70] For 23 years,
[3162.88 → 3163.92] Israel refused
[3163.92 → 3164.90] to listen to God.
[3165.78 → 3166.18] Israel,
[3166.42 → 3166.56] you know,
[3166.58 → 3167.94] as we read in Luke,
[3168.48 → 3169.42] killed the prophets,
[3170.14 → 3170.96] sent them away.
[3171.58 → 3173.10] Later on in Lamentations
[3173.10 → 3173.64] chapter 2,
[3173.72 → 3175.00] they listened to false prophets,
[3175.62 → 3176.40] to words that they
[3176.40 → 3177.22] wanted to hear.
[3178.82 → 3179.46] We said,
[3179.78 → 3179.80] peace,
[3179.94 → 3180.16] peace,
[3180.20 → 3181.14] when there was no peace.
[3182.50 → 3183.74] And they exhausted
[3183.74 → 3184.80] the Lord's patience.
[3186.12 → 3187.18] And the time had come
[3187.18 → 3188.58] for him to deliver
[3188.58 → 3189.84] on his word,
[3190.10 → 3191.82] spoken in Deuteronomy 28,
[3191.98 → 3192.80] because the Lord
[3192.80 → 3193.96] is faithful to his word.
[3196.12 → 3197.20] And as we look through
[3197.20 → 3198.80] this passage in Lamentations,
[3198.90 → 3200.10] the interesting thing is,
[3200.18 → 3201.06] all that the Lord
[3201.06 → 3202.16] was removing
[3202.16 → 3203.00] and destroying
[3203.00 → 3204.60] is,
[3204.86 → 3205.80] are the very things
[3205.80 → 3206.30] that the people
[3206.30 → 3207.20] had already rejected.
[3208.64 → 3208.90] Right?
[3208.92 → 3209.44] They had already
[3209.44 → 3210.30] turned away
[3210.30 → 3211.98] from worshipping the Lord
[3211.98 → 3212.60] and they had turned
[3212.60 → 3213.16] to worshipping
[3213.16 → 3213.74] false gods.
[3214.84 → 3215.62] They didn't need
[3215.62 → 3216.58] the temple anymore.
[3218.18 → 3218.98] And so the Lord
[3218.98 → 3219.80] took it away from them.
[3222.00 → 3222.90] And God's judgment
[3222.90 → 3223.78] on his people
[3223.78 → 3225.46] reveals the faithfulness
[3225.46 → 3225.98] of God
[3225.98 → 3226.96] to his own word
[3226.96 → 3228.36] and to his covenant promises.
[3229.20 → 3229.30] Right?
[3229.44 → 3230.40] God is a God
[3230.40 → 3231.20] who does
[3231.20 → 3232.04] what he says
[3232.04 → 3232.62] he will do.
[3233.58 → 3234.06] Even
[3234.06 → 3236.26] when that faithfulness
[3236.26 → 3237.40] to his word
[3237.40 → 3238.80] leads to judgment
[3238.80 → 3239.56] on his own people.
[3239.56 → 3242.40] You know,
[3242.44 → 3242.82] I was thinking
[3242.82 → 3243.86] of an illustration
[3243.86 → 3245.32] of a parent
[3245.32 → 3246.78] parenting their child.
[3246.88 → 3247.10] You know,
[3247.18 → 3247.58] the whole
[3247.58 → 3249.32] one, two, three things.
[3250.62 → 3251.16] You know,
[3251.22 → 3251.70] I'm going to count
[3251.70 → 3252.12] to three.
[3252.96 → 3253.98] Stop doing that.
[3254.32 → 3254.72] One,
[3255.34 → 3256.20] two,
[3256.76 → 3257.06] three.
[3257.30 → 3257.78] And then what?
[3258.10 → 3258.34] Okay,
[3258.40 → 3259.14] now we're in a dilemma.
[3260.26 → 3260.96] Does the parent
[3260.96 → 3262.58] follow through
[3262.58 → 3263.72] with the consequence?
[3264.24 → 3265.04] Or they say,
[3265.34 → 3266.20] don't make me count
[3266.20 → 3266.62] to four.
[3267.14 → 3267.90] I'm going to start over.
[3268.12 → 3268.94] You better do it.
[3269.82 → 3270.70] And on and on and on.
[3270.78 → 3270.92] You know,
[3270.98 → 3271.56] God had given
[3271.56 → 3272.70] all of this leeway
[3272.70 → 3273.30] and eventually
[3273.30 → 3275.02] for the sake
[3275.02 → 3275.72] of the child
[3275.72 → 3276.94] the parent has to say,
[3277.10 → 3277.30] okay,
[3278.26 → 3279.50] I gave you a chance.
[3279.62 → 3280.52] Now you need to.
[3281.14 → 3282.02] This is the consequence.
[3282.34 → 3282.50] Right?
[3284.72 → 3285.70] And in the same way
[3285.70 → 3287.04] God follows through
[3287.04 → 3287.88] on his discipline
[3287.88 → 3288.96] because he's a good father.
[3289.88 → 3290.76] For our good.
[3291.56 → 3293.20] If God is to remain true
[3293.20 → 3294.38] to who he is,
[3294.44 → 3295.00] his character,
[3295.30 → 3296.46] he has to judge
[3296.46 → 3297.52] the unrighteousness
[3297.52 → 3298.24] and the injustice
[3298.24 → 3299.92] of his people
[3299.92 → 3301.62] because he takes sin seriously.
[3301.94 → 3303.12] He needs to discipline
[3303.12 → 3303.68] his people.
[3304.74 → 3305.70] And then lament,
[3305.98 → 3307.28] the practice of lament,
[3307.90 → 3309.28] also has to acknowledge
[3309.28 → 3310.26] God's right
[3310.26 → 3311.12] to judge
[3311.12 → 3312.20] humanity.
[3313.78 → 3315.20] God hates sin.
[3315.66 → 3316.80] He hates idolatry
[3316.80 → 3317.88] and injustice
[3317.88 → 3318.54] and oppression
[3318.54 → 3319.84] that they were enacting
[3319.84 → 3321.56] upon foreigners
[3321.56 → 3322.40] and children
[3322.40 → 3323.30] and widows
[3323.30 → 3324.54] and the rich
[3324.54 → 3325.10] were getting richer
[3325.10 → 3326.66] and they were stealing land
[3326.66 → 3327.12] and they were doing
[3327.12 → 3327.86] all of this stuff
[3327.86 → 3329.06] and God hates it all.
[3330.48 → 3331.84] He called them to repent.
[3331.96 → 3332.82] They wouldn't repent.
[3334.62 → 3335.58] And he enacts
[3335.58 → 3336.18] his judgment
[3336.18 → 3337.42] even when it's
[3337.42 → 3338.56] his own people
[3338.56 → 3339.96] who are the perpetrators
[3339.96 → 3340.86] of all these things.
[3343.52 → 3344.44] But God,
[3344.70 → 3346.14] as he proves himself
[3346.14 → 3346.70] faithful
[3346.70 → 3348.10] in bringing judgment
[3348.10 → 3349.78] upon Israel's disobedience,
[3349.78 → 3351.64] when we see
[3351.64 → 3352.38] his faithfulness
[3352.38 → 3353.02] to do that,
[3353.12 → 3354.52] we can be sure
[3354.52 → 3355.48] and certain
[3355.48 → 3356.62] that he will also
[3356.62 → 3357.22] be faithful
[3357.22 → 3358.00] to heal.
[3358.90 → 3360.32] That he will heal
[3360.32 → 3361.60] and bring redemption.
[3361.84 → 3362.98] And that's what we turn to
[3362.98 → 3363.62] in our next point
[3363.62 → 3364.12] this morning.
[3364.34 → 3365.40] That God is not only
[3365.40 → 3366.26] a God who is faithful
[3366.26 → 3367.40] to judge,
[3367.56 → 3368.40] but he is faithful
[3368.40 → 3369.30] to heal.
[3371.18 → 3372.42] And this journey
[3372.42 → 3373.10] of healing
[3373.10 → 3374.66] is a journey
[3374.66 → 3375.62] that begins
[3375.62 → 3376.10] with lament.
[3376.10 → 3376.22] lament.
[3377.12 → 3377.72] It's a journey
[3377.72 → 3378.40] that begins
[3378.40 → 3379.90] with crying out
[3379.90 → 3380.88] to God
[3380.88 → 3382.38] because it's in that move
[3382.38 → 3383.80] that we turn to God.
[3384.60 → 3386.14] We seek to renew
[3386.14 → 3387.70] our relationship
[3387.70 → 3388.24] with him.
[3388.80 → 3388.92] You know,
[3389.02 → 3390.36] so I began this morning
[3390.36 → 3391.20] telling you about
[3391.20 → 3392.28] that radio journalist,
[3392.56 → 3393.18] Herbert Morrison,
[3393.58 → 3394.82] that tragic disaster
[3394.82 → 3396.98] of the Hindenburg airship.
[3398.92 → 3399.20] Well,
[3399.28 → 3400.02] as Morrison
[3400.02 → 3401.18] was reporting
[3401.18 → 3402.40] everything that had happened,
[3402.78 → 3403.28] by the way,
[3403.34 → 3403.98] you can go on YouTube
[3403.98 → 3405.26] and watch and listen to this,
[3406.10 → 3407.52] as he was reporting
[3407.52 → 3408.92] on just what was happening,
[3409.02 → 3410.18] the tragedy that had happened,
[3410.46 → 3412.18] he became overwhelmed
[3412.18 → 3415.02] by this tragedy
[3415.02 → 3415.88] that was unfolding
[3415.88 → 3416.94] before his eyes.
[3417.70 → 3418.32] And probably
[3418.32 → 3419.48] the most famous line
[3419.48 → 3420.46] from his report
[3420.46 → 3421.82] is when he cries out,
[3422.12 → 3423.26] oh, the humanity.
[3425.80 → 3426.66] And then his voice
[3426.66 → 3427.88] begins to crack up
[3427.88 → 3430.44] as grief makes its way
[3430.44 → 3432.04] into his descriptions.
[3432.62 → 3433.24] And by the end
[3433.24 → 3433.92] of the recording,
[3434.06 → 3435.06] he just can't do it anymore.
[3435.06 → 3437.16] He says,
[3437.38 → 3439.18] I can hardly breathe
[3439.18 → 3439.82] and talk.
[3440.86 → 3441.24] He says,
[3441.30 → 3441.90] listen, folks,
[3441.98 → 3443.24] I'm going to have to stop
[3443.24 → 3444.60] because I've lost my voice.
[3445.04 → 3445.92] It's just terrible.
[3446.34 → 3447.18] This is the worst thing
[3447.18 → 3448.12] I've ever witnessed.
[3450.70 → 3450.92] Right?
[3451.02 → 3451.96] So for Morrison,
[3452.70 → 3453.96] a tragedy like this
[3453.96 → 3454.90] couldn't be described
[3454.90 → 3456.14] simply as a neutral,
[3456.28 → 3457.54] detached way.
[3457.54 → 3460.82] And the same goes
[3460.82 → 3461.44] for Jeremiah
[3461.44 → 3462.44] in our text.
[3463.42 → 3463.54] Right?
[3463.68 → 3464.40] For Jeremiah,
[3465.02 → 3465.70] it's as if,
[3465.74 → 3465.92] you know,
[3466.02 → 3466.98] verses 1 through 10,
[3467.04 → 3467.82] he's just reporting
[3467.82 → 3468.92] on all that had happened
[3468.92 → 3470.82] and he gets to verse 11
[3470.82 → 3471.74] and it suddenly
[3471.74 → 3472.80] becomes too much for him
[3472.80 → 3475.12] to simply just describe
[3475.12 → 3475.74] what is happening
[3475.74 → 3477.18] and he becomes overwhelmed.
[3477.68 → 3479.14] So verse 11 says this,
[3479.14 → 3495.46] Jeremiah,
[3495.46 → 3496.28] Jeremiah,
[3496.84 → 3498.20] he's known as
[3498.20 → 3500.12] the weeping prophet.
[3502.46 → 3504.60] And even as he's narrating
[3504.60 → 3505.38] what had happened,
[3505.60 → 3507.32] he is filled with godly tears.
[3508.12 → 3508.98] Tears for the city.
[3509.70 → 3511.04] Tears for the people
[3511.04 → 3512.08] that he loved.
[3514.50 → 3516.28] Then in verses 18 and 19,
[3516.82 → 3519.12] he not only laments himself,
[3520.12 → 3522.42] but he calls on the people
[3522.42 → 3523.84] who up until now
[3523.84 → 3524.76] have remained silent,
[3524.92 → 3525.30] probably,
[3525.48 → 3525.68] you know,
[3525.74 → 3527.84] just struck silent by grief
[3527.84 → 3529.38] as can happen to us.
[3530.58 → 3531.76] But he calls on them
[3531.76 → 3533.04] to join him
[3533.04 → 3534.40] in crying out to God.
[3535.22 → 3536.20] So this is what he says,
[3536.26 → 3537.06] kind of halfway through
[3537.06 → 3537.80] verse 18.
[3538.00 → 3538.42] He says,
[3538.42 → 3539.50] let your tears flow
[3539.50 → 3540.26] like a river.
[3541.44 → 3542.24] Day and night,
[3542.38 → 3543.64] give yourself no relief,
[3543.90 → 3545.50] your eyes no rest.
[3546.54 → 3547.06] Arise,
[3547.24 → 3548.76] cry out in the night
[3548.76 → 3549.60] as the watches
[3549.60 → 3550.72] of the night begin.
[3551.20 → 3552.56] Pour out your heart
[3552.56 → 3553.76] like water
[3553.76 → 3554.92] in the presence
[3554.92 → 3556.06] of the Lord.
[3559.50 → 3561.34] It's an exhortation
[3561.34 → 3562.32] to lament.
[3564.14 → 3564.90] Jeremiah says,
[3565.22 → 3566.02] cry out.
[3566.74 → 3567.72] Don't be silent.
[3567.92 → 3569.14] Don't even sleep.
[3569.66 → 3570.98] Pour out your heart
[3570.98 → 3572.04] before the Lord.
[3573.04 → 3573.68] And it's a sense
[3573.68 → 3575.22] to hold the reality
[3575.22 → 3575.88] of suffering
[3575.88 → 3577.08] before God
[3577.08 → 3579.12] and call him
[3579.12 → 3579.96] to see it,
[3580.22 → 3581.32] to acknowledge it,
[3581.38 → 3582.08] to be aware,
[3582.46 → 3583.42] just like the Israelites
[3583.42 → 3584.36] did when they were
[3584.36 → 3585.26] enslaved in Egypt
[3585.26 → 3586.40] and they called out to God.
[3587.14 → 3588.44] And God heard
[3588.44 → 3589.24] their cries.
[3591.58 → 3591.98] And friends,
[3592.08 → 3593.00] this exhortation
[3593.00 → 3593.64] to lament
[3593.64 → 3595.62] remains for us today.
[3596.62 → 3597.70] We are called
[3597.70 → 3598.72] to be people
[3598.72 → 3599.50] of lament.
[3599.50 → 3599.64] lament.
[3601.36 → 3602.30] But this is something
[3602.30 → 3602.94] that we are not
[3602.94 → 3603.66] always good at,
[3603.72 → 3604.00] is it?
[3606.48 → 3607.32] Despite lament
[3607.32 → 3608.48] being a major
[3608.48 → 3610.86] genre in Scripture,
[3611.38 → 3611.52] right,
[3611.60 → 3611.78] you know,
[3611.84 → 3612.82] like one-third
[3612.82 → 3613.68] of the Psalms
[3613.68 → 3614.58] are Psalms of lament,
[3615.22 → 3615.98] as well as
[3615.98 → 3617.42] the book of Lamentations,
[3618.10 → 3619.02] much of Jeremiah
[3619.02 → 3619.92] and Isaiah
[3619.92 → 3621.22] and the book of Job
[3621.22 → 3622.08] and more,
[3622.38 → 3623.02] lament still
[3623.02 → 3623.86] is a seldom,
[3624.60 → 3625.54] seldom is a part
[3625.54 → 3626.36] of our Christian worship.
[3626.36 → 3627.90] I was reading
[3627.90 → 3628.84] an article this week
[3628.84 → 3629.52] from the banner
[3629.52 → 3630.12] online,
[3630.84 → 3631.70] and it was an article
[3631.70 → 3633.00] published a few years ago,
[3633.10 → 3633.64] and the title
[3633.64 → 3634.70] of the article is
[3634.70 → 3635.78] Where Have All
[3635.78 → 3637.44] the Sad Songs Gone?
[3639.08 → 3639.96] And it talked
[3639.96 → 3641.42] about how CCI,
[3641.74 → 3641.90] right,
[3641.98 → 3643.14] which is licenses,
[3643.34 → 3643.84] local churches
[3643.84 → 3644.34] like ours,
[3644.40 → 3644.90] to sing
[3644.90 → 3646.44] contemporary worship songs,
[3647.00 → 3647.78] how it puts out
[3647.78 → 3649.48] a yearly
[3649.48 → 3650.84] annual report
[3650.84 → 3651.42] of the top
[3651.42 → 3652.28] 100 songs.
[3653.40 → 3654.88] The top 100 songs
[3654.88 → 3656.02] played in the churches,
[3656.36 → 3657.60] year after year,
[3657.84 → 3659.22] and year after year,
[3659.36 → 3661.10] only a few
[3661.10 → 3662.74] qualify
[3662.74 → 3664.22] as songs of lament,
[3664.90 → 3665.74] right?
[3665.80 → 3667.20] Despite over 30%
[3667.20 → 3668.06] of our Psalms
[3668.06 → 3669.12] being Psalms of lament,
[3669.60 → 3671.34] maybe 5%
[3671.34 → 3672.46] of the songs
[3672.46 → 3673.48] we sing in church
[3673.48 → 3675.00] can qualify
[3675.00 → 3675.86] in any way
[3675.86 → 3676.56] as a lament.
[3678.72 → 3680.16] We're off balance.
[3681.58 → 3683.12] And this conspicuous
[3683.12 → 3684.48] absence of lament
[3684.48 → 3685.46] in the church
[3685.46 → 3686.66] leads to forgetting
[3686.66 → 3687.62] our need
[3687.62 → 3688.28] to lament.
[3689.64 → 3691.08] And even if we know
[3691.08 → 3691.58] our need
[3691.58 → 3692.24] to lament,
[3692.62 → 3694.34] we forget how
[3694.34 → 3695.22] because we don't
[3695.22 → 3695.82] practice it.
[3697.26 → 3698.18] And this balance
[3698.18 → 3698.70] in Scripture
[3698.70 → 3699.72] between praise
[3699.72 → 3700.76] and lament,
[3701.88 → 3702.06] right,
[3702.20 → 3703.20] celebrating God's
[3703.96 → 3705.14] joys
[3705.14 → 3706.56] and crying out
[3706.56 → 3707.14] in sorrow,
[3707.52 → 3708.12] that balance
[3708.12 → 3708.90] has been lost.
[3708.90 → 3711.38] and this affects
[3711.38 → 3712.02] the way we
[3712.02 → 3712.88] understand the gospel.
[3712.88 → 3713.84] It affects,
[3714.58 → 3715.32] it weakens
[3715.32 → 3716.08] our witness
[3716.08 → 3716.66] in the world.
[3717.78 → 3718.00] Right?
[3718.06 → 3718.76] Because when suffering
[3718.76 → 3719.86] isn't given voice
[3719.86 → 3720.54] in the church,
[3721.04 → 3721.98] we become
[3721.98 → 3723.38] ill-equipped
[3723.38 → 3725.04] as Christ's followers
[3725.04 → 3725.88] to be
[3725.88 → 3726.74] his hands and feet
[3726.74 → 3727.28] in the world
[3727.28 → 3728.30] because we don't know
[3728.30 → 3729.24] how to cry out
[3729.24 → 3730.06] for the hurt
[3730.06 → 3730.58] of the world.
[3730.58 → 3734.44] Our response
[3734.44 → 3735.86] to the brokenness
[3735.86 → 3736.46] of the world
[3736.46 → 3737.06] should be like
[3737.06 → 3737.52] Jeremiah
[3737.52 → 3738.94] to cry out
[3738.94 → 3739.54] about it.
[3740.06 → 3740.18] Right?
[3740.24 → 3740.78] Our hearts
[3740.78 → 3741.62] should break.
[3742.58 → 3742.96] We must
[3742.96 → 3743.80] continually say,
[3744.16 → 3744.40] Lord,
[3744.56 → 3745.42] help us.
[3745.70 → 3745.90] Lord,
[3746.00 → 3746.74] have mercy
[3746.74 → 3747.28] on us.
[3747.56 → 3747.70] Lord,
[3747.80 → 3748.28] heal us.
[3748.42 → 3748.56] Lord,
[3748.86 → 3749.78] restore us.
[3752.66 → 3753.50] And so I was
[3753.50 → 3754.26] talking with Marion
[3754.26 → 3755.00] and I don't want
[3755.00 → 3755.30] to forget
[3755.30 → 3755.92] mentioning this,
[3756.00 → 3756.42] but we were,
[3756.74 → 3756.92] you know,
[3756.96 → 3757.86] in this season of Lent,
[3757.92 → 3758.50] we're trying to learn
[3758.50 → 3758.98] as a church
[3758.98 → 3759.50] what it means
[3759.50 → 3760.32] to lament.
[3760.68 → 3761.70] And so what we're
[3761.70 → 3762.00] going to do
[3762.00 → 3762.52] is organized
[3762.52 → 3763.78] a service of lament.
[3764.10 → 3764.98] Probably not a Sunday,
[3765.10 → 3765.90] probably a weeknight.
[3766.76 → 3767.64] We're not sure yet
[3767.64 → 3768.34] when it will be,
[3768.98 → 3769.92] but I wanted to put
[3769.92 → 3770.66] this in your minds
[3770.66 → 3771.22] that, you know,
[3771.24 → 3771.66] this is something
[3771.66 → 3772.22] that we should try
[3772.22 → 3773.68] to live into
[3773.68 → 3775.02] and practice together.
[3775.20 → 3775.88] So we're going to do
[3775.88 → 3776.70] a special service
[3776.70 → 3777.08] of lament
[3777.08 → 3777.66] at some point.
[3780.92 → 3781.80] But one thing
[3781.80 → 3782.60] that struck me
[3782.60 → 3784.80] about this cry
[3784.80 → 3785.52] of lament
[3785.52 → 3786.72] that we find here
[3786.72 → 3787.70] in Lamentations
[3787.70 → 3788.30] chapter 2
[3788.30 → 3790.86] is notice
[3790.86 → 3792.20] that God
[3792.20 → 3793.66] doesn't interrupt them.
[3795.30 → 3796.20] God doesn't
[3796.20 → 3796.82] interject.
[3797.40 → 3797.70] He doesn't
[3797.70 → 3798.50] cut them off.
[3799.46 → 3800.08] He doesn't say,
[3800.26 → 3800.92] how dare you
[3800.92 → 3801.78] cry out to me?
[3801.84 → 3802.48] You deserve
[3802.48 → 3803.84] what you got.
[3805.08 → 3805.98] God doesn't say
[3805.98 → 3806.90] anything like that.
[3807.86 → 3809.12] God treasures
[3809.12 → 3810.88] this honest,
[3811.12 → 3811.74] heartfelt
[3811.74 → 3812.74] complaint
[3812.74 → 3813.44] against him.
[3814.82 → 3815.68] He treasures
[3815.68 → 3816.54] it so much
[3816.54 → 3817.62] that he includes
[3817.62 → 3819.82] it as a book
[3819.82 → 3820.46] in scripture.
[3821.76 → 3822.52] A book,
[3822.82 → 3823.40] Lamentations,
[3823.50 → 3824.24] that is entirely
[3824.24 → 3825.16] of human speech.
[3826.94 → 3827.06] Right?
[3827.10 → 3828.02] How amazing is that
[3828.02 → 3829.06] that God includes
[3829.06 → 3830.52] these words
[3830.52 → 3831.90] crying out to him
[3831.90 → 3833.24] as his revelation
[3833.24 → 3833.92] of himself
[3833.92 → 3834.74] back to us.
[3834.74 → 3839.92] God wants to
[3839.92 → 3840.58] have with his
[3840.58 → 3840.88] children.
[3841.98 → 3842.10] Right?
[3842.14 → 3842.94] He invites us
[3842.94 → 3843.50] to lament.
[3844.08 → 3845.08] He doesn't
[3845.08 → 3845.94] interrupt us.
[3846.30 → 3846.94] He listens.
[3848.50 → 3849.44] And in a sense,
[3849.52 → 3850.20] it is God himself
[3850.20 → 3851.46] through his word
[3851.46 → 3852.74] who is calling
[3852.74 → 3853.64] upon Israel
[3853.64 → 3854.42] and us today
[3854.42 → 3855.86] to pour out
[3855.86 → 3856.80] our hearts
[3856.80 → 3858.22] before the Lord.
[3858.22 → 3858.28] God.
[3860.50 → 3861.02] Because,
[3861.12 → 3861.32] you see,
[3861.40 → 3861.80] the Lord
[3861.80 → 3862.60] may be
[3862.60 → 3863.72] this all-consuming
[3863.72 → 3864.70] judge of the earth.
[3865.06 → 3866.38] He may punish
[3866.38 → 3866.80] his people
[3866.80 → 3867.58] for their sin,
[3867.84 → 3868.82] but he hasn't
[3868.82 → 3869.68] stopped being
[3869.68 → 3870.26] their God.
[3871.12 → 3871.70] He hasn't
[3871.70 → 3872.18] stopped being
[3872.18 → 3872.64] their God.
[3874.02 → 3874.92] His people
[3874.92 → 3875.58] may have been
[3875.58 → 3876.32] faithless
[3876.32 → 3877.26] towards him,
[3877.52 → 3878.58] but he wasn't
[3878.58 → 3879.18] going to give up
[3879.18 → 3879.84] on his people.
[3880.48 → 3881.12] He's still
[3881.12 → 3881.74] their God.
[3881.98 → 3882.50] He's still
[3882.50 → 3883.22] willing to hear
[3883.22 → 3883.82] their prayers.
[3884.20 → 3884.58] He's still
[3884.58 → 3885.36] willing to receive
[3885.36 → 3886.00] their tears.
[3886.00 → 3888.48] And though
[3888.48 → 3889.28] God is a God
[3889.28 → 3890.28] who will by no
[3890.28 → 3890.86] means clear
[3890.86 → 3891.34] the guilty,
[3891.90 → 3892.70] he is also
[3892.70 → 3893.36] a God
[3893.36 → 3894.50] who is
[3894.50 → 3894.94] merciful
[3894.94 → 3896.22] and faithful
[3896.22 → 3897.52] to his covenant.
[3897.92 → 3898.70] His people
[3898.70 → 3899.40] cannot keep
[3899.40 → 3899.84] the covenant,
[3900.52 → 3901.34] so he keeps
[3901.34 → 3901.54] it.
[3902.26 → 3903.06] He is faithful.
[3903.96 → 3904.54] He hears
[3904.54 → 3905.00] the cries
[3905.00 → 3905.60] of his people.
[3906.16 → 3906.82] He won't
[3906.82 → 3907.88] let the destruction
[3907.88 → 3908.66] of his people
[3908.66 → 3909.36] be the end
[3909.36 → 3910.06] of their story.
[3912.26 → 3912.54] You know,
[3912.62 → 3913.04] finally,
[3913.50 → 3914.48] in this passage,
[3914.66 → 3914.76] we,
[3915.42 → 3915.98] verse 13,
[3916.00 → 3917.18] really stands
[3917.18 → 3917.48] out.
[3919.20 → 3919.48] Jeremiah
[3919.48 → 3920.24] asked a
[3920.24 → 3920.64] desperate
[3920.64 → 3921.36] question.
[3922.24 → 3922.78] Look at
[3922.78 → 3923.44] this question
[3923.44 → 3923.94] he asked
[3923.94 → 3924.64] in verse 13.
[3925.02 → 3925.48] He says,
[3925.82 → 3926.52] your wound
[3926.52 → 3927.46] is as deep
[3927.46 → 3928.66] as the sea.
[3929.72 → 3930.32] Who can
[3930.32 → 3930.80] heal you?
[3937.44 → 3938.26] And that
[3938.26 → 3938.94] question is
[3938.94 → 3939.84] left unanswered
[3939.84 → 3941.56] in Lamentations
[3941.56 → 3942.14] chapter 2.
[3943.36 → 3944.18] But we
[3944.18 → 3944.56] don't just
[3944.56 → 3944.92] have
[3944.92 → 3945.50] Lamentations.
[3945.50 → 3945.92] We,
[3946.22 → 3946.74] as Christians,
[3946.90 → 3947.18] we have
[3947.18 → 3947.52] the whole
[3947.52 → 3947.96] of Scripture.
[3949.88 → 3950.56] And as
[3950.56 → 3951.10] the story
[3951.10 → 3951.56] of God's
[3951.56 → 3951.80] dealing
[3951.80 → 3952.14] with his
[3952.14 → 3952.50] people
[3952.50 → 3953.02] continues
[3953.02 → 3953.90] to unfold,
[3954.24 → 3954.58] throughout
[3954.58 → 3955.12] the Scriptures
[3955.12 → 3955.74] we begin
[3955.74 → 3956.32] to arrive
[3956.32 → 3956.92] at an
[3956.92 → 3957.30] answer
[3957.30 → 3957.90] to that
[3957.90 → 3958.30] question.
[3959.30 → 3959.62] And the
[3959.62 → 3960.40] answer comes
[3960.40 → 3961.20] 2,000 years
[3961.20 → 3961.58] later,
[3962.04 → 3962.76] when God
[3962.76 → 3963.56] again makes
[3963.56 → 3964.08] war
[3964.08 → 3965.04] with even
[3965.04 → 3965.76] greater
[3965.76 → 3966.88] fury
[3966.88 → 3968.16] against
[3968.16 → 3968.76] his own
[3968.76 → 3969.04] son.
[3969.04 → 3969.66] God
[3969.66 → 3971.38] and
[3971.38 → 3971.58] you know,
[3971.64 → 3972.04] the greatest
[3972.04 → 3972.56] terror
[3972.56 → 3973.20] of the
[3973.20 → 3973.66] cross
[3973.66 → 3974.84] wasn't just
[3974.84 → 3975.42] the physical
[3975.42 → 3976.00] torment
[3976.00 → 3976.92] that Christ
[3976.92 → 3977.26] endured,
[3977.34 → 3978.04] as horrible
[3978.04 → 3978.56] as that
[3978.56 → 3979.00] was.
[3979.88 → 3980.66] The greater
[3980.66 → 3981.16] terror
[3981.16 → 3982.24] was
[3982.24 → 3983.02] spiritual.
[3984.02 → 3984.78] When Christ
[3984.78 → 3985.62] drank the
[3985.62 → 3986.50] cup of God's
[3986.50 → 3987.38] wrath down
[3987.38 → 3987.82] to its
[3987.82 → 3988.42] dregs
[3988.42 → 3989.44] for you
[3989.44 → 3990.04] and for me.
[3990.04 → 3993.10] the prophet
[3993.10 → 3994.08] Isaiah says,
[3994.20 → 3994.88] by his
[3994.88 → 3995.56] wounds
[3995.56 → 3997.18] we have
[3997.18 → 3997.66] been healed.
[3998.96 → 3999.72] That's how
[3999.72 → 4000.06] we answer
[4000.06 → 4000.66] that question.
[4002.14 → 4002.76] Right?
[4002.82 → 4003.20] When God
[4003.20 → 4003.74] brought his
[4003.74 → 4004.12] judgment
[4004.12 → 4005.16] against Jerusalem,
[4005.36 → 4005.70] when that
[4005.70 → 4006.32] temple laid
[4006.32 → 4006.84] in ruin,
[4007.30 → 4007.76] he had
[4007.76 → 4008.56] removed the
[4008.56 → 4008.92] means of
[4008.92 → 4009.60] access
[4009.60 → 4011.30] to him
[4011.30 → 4012.06] under the
[4012.06 → 4012.54] old covenant.
[4013.10 → 4014.00] The altar
[4014.00 → 4014.44] was torn
[4014.44 → 4014.66] down,
[4014.72 → 4015.06] the ark
[4015.06 → 4015.26] of the
[4015.26 → 4015.58] covenant
[4015.58 → 4016.60] forgotten.
[4017.74 → 4018.46] But when
[4018.46 → 4018.96] he tore
[4018.96 → 4019.80] down all
[4019.80 → 4020.22] of that,
[4020.30 → 4020.70] the Lord
[4020.70 → 4021.32] was going
[4021.32 → 4021.90] to rebuild
[4021.90 → 4022.38] a better
[4022.38 → 4022.70] temple.
[4023.34 → 4023.66] And it's
[4023.66 → 4024.08] not that
[4024.08 → 4024.64] temple that
[4024.64 → 4025.22] was rebuilt
[4025.22 → 4025.58] in that
[4025.58 → 4026.16] same spot
[4026.16 → 4026.84] 70 years
[4026.84 → 4027.58] later when
[4027.58 → 4028.08] the exiles
[4028.08 → 4029.02] returned from
[4029.02 → 4030.46] their exile
[4030.46 → 4030.94] in Babylon.
[4031.94 → 4032.54] But the
[4032.54 → 4033.08] temple that
[4033.08 → 4033.52] God was
[4033.52 → 4033.94] rebuilding
[4033.94 → 4035.58] was the
[4035.58 → 4036.10] temple of
[4036.10 → 4036.84] Jesus Christ.
[4037.94 → 4038.06] Right?
[4038.16 → 4039.34] Jesus himself
[4039.34 → 4040.42] became that
[4040.42 → 4040.92] place where
[4040.92 → 4041.42] heaven and
[4041.42 → 4041.94] earth meet.
[4043.72 → 4044.90] Jesus himself
[4044.90 → 4046.68] became the
[4046.68 → 4048.10] sacrifice for
[4048.10 → 4049.12] sin once and
[4049.12 → 4049.72] for all.
[4049.80 → 4049.90] God.
[4050.30 → 4050.96] So that
[4050.96 → 4051.52] our sins
[4051.52 → 4051.82] could be
[4051.82 → 4052.18] forgiven.
[4052.32 → 4052.56] So that
[4052.56 → 4052.84] we could
[4052.84 → 4053.70] be restored
[4053.70 → 4054.06] to a
[4054.06 → 4054.52] relationship
[4054.52 → 4055.10] with God.
[4056.36 → 4056.84] Jesus
[4056.84 → 4057.58] himself
[4057.58 → 4058.84] became the
[4058.84 → 4059.60] person through
[4059.60 → 4060.04] whom we
[4060.04 → 4060.80] worship God.
[4062.10 → 4062.72] And it's
[4062.72 → 4063.20] through Jesus
[4063.20 → 4063.74] that we have
[4063.74 → 4065.64] access now to
[4065.64 → 4066.20] the throne of
[4066.20 → 4066.56] grace.
[4066.84 → 4067.52] Where we can
[4067.52 → 4068.08] bring our
[4068.08 → 4068.64] laments.
[4069.04 → 4069.54] Where God is
[4069.54 → 4070.20] willing to hear
[4070.20 → 4070.58] us.
[4071.14 → 4071.74] Where we can
[4071.74 → 4072.32] come and say,
[4072.70 → 4073.22] Lord, for the
[4073.22 → 4073.68] sake of your
[4073.68 → 4074.28] name, for the
[4074.28 → 4074.72] sake of your
[4074.72 → 4075.88] glory, for the
[4075.88 → 4076.28] sake of your
[4076.28 → 4077.38] children, look
[4077.38 → 4079.48] and see and
[4079.48 → 4080.36] rescue us.
[4081.90 → 4083.68] In Jesus, we
[4083.68 → 4085.02] see the true and
[4085.02 → 4086.18] greater weeping
[4086.18 → 4086.66] prophet.
[4087.48 → 4088.02] Right?
[4088.08 → 4088.86] Who wept over
[4088.86 → 4089.48] Jerusalem.
[4090.24 → 4091.40] Who longs to
[4091.40 → 4092.06] gather his
[4092.06 → 4093.58] people under his
[4093.58 → 4094.54] wings, as we
[4094.54 → 4096.02] read earlier in
[4096.02 → 4096.68] the Gospel of
[4096.68 → 4096.90] Luke.
[4097.62 → 4098.14] So friends, that
[4098.14 → 4098.82] means when we
[4098.82 → 4100.26] lament as a
[4100.26 → 4101.36] people, we do so
[4101.36 → 4101.98] in relationship.
[4102.78 → 4102.96] Right?
[4102.96 → 4103.44] We do it in
[4103.44 → 4104.30] relationship with
[4104.30 → 4106.58] God, who walks
[4106.58 → 4107.18] with us in our
[4107.18 → 4108.36] suffering, who
[4108.36 → 4109.26] understands the
[4109.26 → 4109.70] way of the
[4109.70 → 4111.10] cross, and who
[4111.10 → 4112.18] laments with us.
[4113.98 → 4114.88] So let's pray.
[4115.16 → 4116.22] Let's ask him to
[4116.22 → 4117.70] help us lament.
[4122.42 → 4123.08] Our Heavenly
[4123.08 → 4123.96] Father, we thank
[4123.96 → 4125.08] you that though we
[4125.08 → 4127.10] sin, though we
[4127.10 → 4128.18] are overcome by
[4128.18 → 4130.66] sin, you are the
[4130.66 → 4131.50] God who welcomes
[4131.50 → 4132.02] us back.
[4132.02 → 4133.44] You're the God
[4133.44 → 4134.52] who heals us of
[4134.52 → 4135.40] our many sins.
[4137.64 → 4138.44] You are the God
[4138.44 → 4139.06] who hears our
[4139.06 → 4139.68] many prayers.
[4139.88 → 4141.02] And though weeping
[4141.02 → 4142.10] may last for the
[4142.10 → 4143.40] morning, or for
[4143.40 → 4144.08] the night, joy
[4144.08 → 4144.58] comes in the
[4144.58 → 4145.06] morning, Lord.
[4146.84 → 4147.58] Lord, thank you
[4147.58 → 4148.32] for hearing our
[4148.32 → 4150.16] cries, that we
[4150.16 → 4152.18] can come to you
[4152.18 → 4152.64] for healing.
[4153.32 → 4154.08] Thank you that you
[4154.08 → 4155.04] are our refuge.
[4155.26 → 4155.90] And we pray, Lord,
[4155.96 → 4156.54] that you would help
[4156.54 → 4157.94] us to become
[4157.94 → 4159.10] people of lament,
[4159.28 → 4160.52] people who are
[4160.52 → 4161.46] able to shed
[4161.46 → 4162.00] tears,
[4162.02 → 4163.12] godly tears,
[4163.68 → 4164.12] Lord, for the
[4164.12 → 4165.48] suffering in this
[4165.48 → 4166.18] world, the
[4166.18 → 4166.78] suffering from our
[4166.78 → 4168.20] neighbours, and the
[4168.20 → 4168.82] suffering that we
[4168.82 → 4169.50] find in our own
[4169.50 → 4169.82] lives.
[4170.54 → 4171.74] We pray in Jesus'
[4171.90 → 4172.08] name.
[4172.56 → 4172.78] Amen.
[4172.78 → 4177.56] So let's stand.
[4177.78 → 4178.68] We'll prepare to sing
[4178.68 → 4179.56] our song of response,
[4179.64 → 4180.30] and I'll let Paul
[4180.30 → 4181.50] introduce this next
[4181.50 → 4181.70] one.
[4181.70 → 4182.14] thank you.
[4182.14 → 4182.20] Thank you.
[4182.20 → 4182.26] Thank you.
[4182.26 → 4182.70] Thank you.
[4182.70 → 4184.46] Thank you.
[4184.46 → 4184.48] Thank you.
[4184.48 → 4184.50] Thank you.
[4184.50 → 4185.08] Thank you.
[4185.08 → 4185.10] Thank you.
[4185.10 → 4186.08] Thank you.
[4186.08 → 4186.14] Thank you.
[4186.14 → 4186.48] Thank you.
[4186.48 → 4186.70] Thank you.
[4186.70 → 4188.42] So here's one of the
[4188.42 → 4189.98] rare songs of lament
[4189.98 → 4191.64] that has been written
[4191.64 → 4193.38] recently, and is to me
[4193.38 → 4194.94] a compelling song for us
[4194.94 → 4196.32] to embrace and to learn
[4196.32 → 4199.54] while we sit in the
[4199.54 → 4201.32] truths of lamentation.
[4201.32 → 4202.78] And it's very singable,
[4202.96 → 4204.10] but very poignant and
[4204.10 → 4207.68] applicable to our study
[4207.68 → 4209.52] of lamentations, although
[4209.52 → 4211.16] this is from one of the
[4211.16 → 4213.72] lament songs, Psalm 13.
[4214.58 → 4215.80] How long, O Lord?
[4216.20 → 4216.72] How long?
[4216.72 → 4216.74] How long?
[4216.74 → 4218.10] Hat 1?
[4218.10 → 4218.98] The psalmist
[4218.98 → 4221.62] Pillow
[4221.84 → 4226.56] Oh, Lord I talk to You.
[4226.56 → 4248.34] O Lord our God, to you, we come
[4248.34 → 4253.70] Will you still hide your face
[4253.70 → 4260.70] We hide before you and on our knees we pray
[4260.70 → 4266.70] O Lord our God
[4266.70 → 4272.70] Our sorrows leave us free, Lord
[4272.70 → 4278.70] Surrounded by our fears
[4278.70 → 4285.70] We look to heaven through feeble faith and tears
[4285.70 → 4290.70] I'm O Lord our God
[4290.70 → 4295.70] Till your glory fills our eyes
[4295.70 → 4300.70] And our faith is turned to sight
[4300.70 → 4306.70] Till our thirst is so more satisfied
[4306.70 → 4313.70] You know my Lord our God
[4313.70 → 4320.70] Our fault and enemies rejoice
[4320.70 → 4325.70] In justice seems to be
[4325.70 → 4328.70] Though we are shaken
[4328.70 → 4329.70] Though we are shaken
[4329.70 → 4332.70] Though we are losing strength
[4332.70 → 4336.70] Though I'm O Lord our God
[4336.70 → 4342.70] In your glory fill our eyes
[4342.70 → 4347.70] And our faith is turned to sight
[4347.70 → 4354.70] Till our thirst is so more satisfied
[4354.70 → 4356.70] Our hope all alone
[4356.70 → 4361.70] Our hope all alone
[4361.70 → 4362.70] You know my Lord our God
[4362.70 → 4363.70] Your grace will be our song
[4363.70 → 4365.70] We bring new mercies
[4365.70 → 4367.70] In every heart
[4367.70 → 4368.70] We bring new mercies
[4368.70 → 4373.70] In every rising sun
[4373.70 → 4374.70] And all alone
[4374.70 → 4376.70] We bring new Lord our God
[4376.70 → 4378.70] We bring new mercies
[4378.70 → 4380.70] In every rising sun
[4380.70 → 4382.70] And all alone
[4382.70 → 4389.70] O Lord our God
[4389.70 → 4390.70] Good our glory fill our eyes
[4390.70 → 4391.64] With every great light
[4391.64 → 4392.70] The earth is over
[4392.70 → 4393.70] little alone
[4393.70 → 4393.74] Till our vigour fills the mind
[4393.74 → 4395.70] Till our thirst is so more possible
[4395.70 → 4397.70] Till our thirst is so more Saturday
[4397.70 → 4398.70] We will have a thirst
[4398.70 → 4399.70] Your packers
[4399.70 → 4400.70] In regard to need Newell continuance
[4400.70 → 4401.70] All one God
[4401.70 → 4410.70] We bring Nehru hostile
[4410.70 → 4414.70] The streets of course on Israel
[4414.70 → 4420.70] Come on, my Lord, come on
[4420.70 → 4430.70] Come on, my Lord, come on
[4440.70 → 4451.32] So we continue to worship the Lord and respond
[4451.32 → 4454.92] By giving our tithes and offerings for the work of his kingdom
[4454.92 → 4459.30] Our designated offering for today is Cascade Christian Counselling
[4459.30 → 4462.78] So may I invite the deacons to come forward and collect the morning offering
[4470.70 → 4488.32] 谁也脱臘
[4488.32 → 4495.68] awards
[4495.68 → 4500.30] the
[4500.30 → 4501.30] Amen.
[4530.30 → 4531.30] Amen.
[4560.30 → 4562.30] Amen.
[4590.30 → 4592.30] Amen.
[4620.30 → 4641.96] Thank you, Joshua.
[4644.02 → 4645.92] So we're going to go to the Lord in prayer.
[4645.92 → 4653.30] But first I'm going to, just sad to announce that actually two members,
[4653.62 → 4656.44] longtime members of our church family have passed away this week.
[4657.22 → 4662.90] So Mike Bart, husband of Kathy Bart, passed away Friday morning in Richmond.
[4664.06 → 4669.02] And Jerry Iron passed away yesterday morning in White Rock.
[4669.02 → 4675.76] And so let's go to the Lord in prayer, asking for the Lord's comfort,
[4675.92 → 4682.82] even as we celebrate that, you know, these longtime saints are now finally,
[4683.04 → 4685.26] you know, seeing the Lord face to face in glory.
[4685.26 → 4692.66] And so as we pray together, I'll pause, and I'll say, Lord, in your mercy,
[4692.78 → 4695.42] when I do so, please respond, hear our prayer.
[4696.08 → 4697.04] So let's pray together.
[4697.52 → 4699.06] And we'll conclude with the Lord's prayer.
[4699.06 → 4706.56] We praise and thank you, O Lord, that you have fed us with your word.
[4707.34 → 4711.36] You have met us in our prayers, in our songs.
[4712.58 → 4720.34] And Lord, we are grateful for your gifts and mindful of the blessing of the communion of your saints.
[4720.34 → 4724.96] And we offer to you our prayers for all people, Lord, God of compassion.
[4725.42 → 4730.26] We remember before you the poor and afflicted, the sick and the dying,
[4731.58 → 4737.86] prisoners and all who are lonely, victims of war, injustice and inhumanity,
[4738.76 → 4743.70] and all others, Lord, who suffer from whatever their sufferings may be called.
[4744.32 → 4747.04] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4747.04 → 4753.56] O God of providence, you hold the destiny of the nations in your hands.
[4754.02 → 4755.62] You move the heart of kings.
[4756.78 → 4758.56] And so we pray for our country.
[4759.58 → 4762.00] Inspire, Lord, the hearts and minds of our leaders,
[4762.68 → 4765.78] that they, together with all our nation,
[4766.48 → 4768.76] may first seek your kingdom and your righteousness,
[4769.28 → 4773.26] so that order and liberty and peace may dwell with your people.
[4773.26 → 4777.60] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayers.
[4780.24 → 4782.44] O God, our creator,
[4783.60 → 4788.26] we pray for all of the many peoples of the whole world.
[4789.74 → 4797.04] Lord, take away the mistrust and lack of understanding that divide all of your creatures.
[4797.04 → 4803.60] Increase in us, O Lord, the recognition that we are all your children made in your image.
[4804.96 → 4811.72] Lord, would you cause wars to cease, division to be healed, families to be reconciled.
[4812.60 → 4815.34] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[4815.34 → 4823.74] O Saviour, O Saviour, God, look upon your church and its struggle upon the earth.
[4824.40 → 4826.24] Lord, have mercy on our weakness.
[4827.38 → 4830.90] Bring to an end our unhappy divisions.
[4832.36 → 4836.18] And Lord, cast away our fears that we might more faithfully follow you.
[4837.48 → 4840.24] Look also upon the ministry, O Lord, of our church.
[4840.92 → 4844.02] Would you increase our courage and strengthen us in faith?
[4844.02 → 4844.12] Would you increase our faith?
[4844.72 → 4845.02] Would you increase our faith?
[4845.02 → 4851.18] Inspire us to be your witnesses here in Ladder and wherever we live, even to the ends of the earth.
[4852.14 → 4854.34] Lord, we pray for Cascade Christian Counselling.
[4854.40 → 4860.40] We thank you for that vital ministry that brings healing to our broken and sinful hearts.
[4860.54 → 4868.14] Lord, would you provide and supply all of their needs so that they may continue this ministry that serves your people.
[4868.88 → 4871.56] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayers.
[4871.56 → 4879.36] God of all comfort, you are the God who weeps with those who weep and mourns with those who mourn.
[4880.12 → 4887.34] Lord, we lift to you the family and friends of our brothers and fathers in the faith, Mike Bart and Jerry Iron.
[4888.88 → 4892.86] Lord, they loved you and they loved your church.
[4892.86 → 4903.60] Lord, we thank you that their battles are now won, that you have brought them into your glorious presence, that their race is finished, that you have crowned them with everlasting life.
[4904.16 → 4908.88] Lord, we give you thanks for their life and their witness, their testimony among us for many years.
[4908.88 → 4922.98] We thank you for all that you've done in them, conforming them into the image of your Son, and now that they stand in glory, no trace of sin still remaining.
[4923.80 → 4929.66] We thank you, Lord, for all that you've done through them in their lives as they lived for you in this world.
[4930.34 → 4933.10] Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayers.
[4933.10 → 4936.50] Father, you are the author of grace and the God of love.
[4936.66 → 4942.26] Send your Holy Spirit now, blessing us here in the present.
[4942.72 → 4951.04] Would you keep our hearts and our thoughts in Jesus Christ, your Son, our only Saviour, who taught us to pray, saying together the Lord's Prayer.
[4951.94 → 4955.60] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[4956.24 → 4960.86] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[4960.86 → 4970.16] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[4970.52 → 4974.82] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[4975.56 → 4982.12] For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
[4983.70 → 4984.74] Please rise.
[4984.74 → 4991.68] Thank you for worshipping together and gathering this morning.
[4992.38 → 4996.24] Please do join us for time of fellowship in the fellowship hall.
[4997.04 → 5000.48] I invite you again to sign up to bring super buns for next week.
[5000.56 → 5005.30] There's a sign-up sheet for that, for seniors, for the membership class, for several things happening.
[5006.04 → 5009.60] And I invite you to hold out your hands as a gesture of receiving God's blessing.
[5009.60 → 5016.80] Jesus said, blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[5017.54 → 5023.58] May the blessing of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be with you now and forever. Amen.
[5025.04 → 5027.66] Remain standing, and we'll sing our final song.
[5027.66 → 5027.74] Amen.
[5027.74 → 5027.82] Amen.
[5039.60 → 5039.70] Amen.

[5084.54 → 5114.14] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[5114.54 → 5126.70] Holy, Holy, I am not found on my feet.
[5126.70 → 5140.28] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[5140.28 → 5146.68] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5147.74 → 5153.16] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5153.16 → 5159.72] For the world is, for the world is.

[5212.40 → 5228.36] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5228.36 → 5244.32] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5244.32 → 5260.28] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5260.28 → 5276.24] Are you long, God, O my dear?
[5276.24 → 5286.20] Are you long, God, O my dear?
